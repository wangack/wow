[1:44:26] Brutusmenis: i will say geting the lock tank rune is some BS
[1:44:26] YaBoiKonann: @ZomBiE519 Project Ascension baby!
[1:45:12] Nokterian: In the end they listen more to the community before that never happened
[1:45:36] Broomba: blizzard just monopolized different wow versions do restrict private servers wow
[1:45:43] Broomba: to*
[1:46:06] cynical_effect12: @Towelliee In my opinion, we are getting the better end of that deal. $15 a month and you get 5 full versions of a game.
[1:46:26] mergpijp: what makes classic such a succes?
[1:46:38] Broomba: the one private server located in usa/canada awhile back
[1:46:44] Broomba: blizzard shut it down
[1:46:49] Eskimo3: Its to bloated
[1:46:53] futomara01: @mergpijp its less complicated
[1:46:53] PixelZen: I still think they got the whole rune idea from a private server
[1:47:03] Nokterian: But i prefer retail because now it values my time
[1:47:03] Flyingmeat: I think with sod for the first time they are trying to go the private server route where they just try stuff. It is actually quite fun to see!
[1:47:18] bigred13x: hey towelie, what dmg meter you running? my details isnt working in sod

[1:50:10] oldjackie: Hi
[1:50:12] zack68: And then you have trill
[1:50:42] Nerendis: I mean, just by sheer numbers. PVErs would win because the pool to draw from is so large. PVPers are probably "better" but you'd end up with more non-number 1 players.
[1:51:01] Fluffy_Pillows: @Towelliee righteous fire is still vstrong :)
[1:52:27] Flyingmeat: the thing is pve is "figured out" and pvp you also have to have luck against your opponents
[1:52:41] MABER_FETT: druids in chat is lvl 20 to low to try to get the wild strikes rune?
[1:52:50] Fluffy_Pillows: no i got it at 14 :P
[1:52:52] Wulfgrym: righteous fire inquisitor is the other build aside from jugg
[1:52:54] DunzoCD: inquisitor is good for RF or it was
[1:52:54] evilequalizer: towelliee if i do skinning what else should i do
[1:52:57] Nerendis: @MABER_FETT Not at all
[1:53:05] Nerendis: @MABER_FETT Mobs are level 14
[1:53:08] ArcaneSyntax: @maber_fett no, you can get it before then too
[1:53:16] BirleED: i mean I'm a multi glad and the people i am playing sod with are mostly multiglad as well and we went through the raid in sod in 45 minutes clear time. but it is just classic mechanics
[1:53:22] ArcaneSyntax: I helped a buddy get it at 11
[1:53:45] Nerendis: Anyone who would claim PVP isn't harder is a dummy
[1:54:08] Flyingmeat: it just more random. :D
[1:54:28] ArcaneSyntax: Anyone who claims either is harder is a dummy.
[1:54:31] DunzoCD: PvP is a chess game at the highest levels
[1:54:40] Nerendis: I think the issue is. Of the 100 best PVErs, more probably play high level PVP. Than of the 100 best PVPers playing high level PVE.

[1:56:26] theDirtyon3: hes been playing classic and SoD
[1:56:35] theDirtyon3: and i think he still PvPs
[1:56:35] ArcaneSyntax: Watching firedup raid makes me feel inadequate

[1:58:51] ArcaneSyntax: I mean classic andies shit on gold buying and then buy a bunch of gold
[1:58:53] CardinalTX: Im enjoying SoD so much i ve also made a horde toon on CS server to pvp with friends, and i never pvp
[1:59:02] Nerendis: My only request for SOD is arenas
[1:59:20] Nerendis: 60
[1:59:23] ClassicMalcontent: They should keep Wrath. But hey they dont thats fine. I am deleting any toons beyond Wrath
[1:59:28] Nerendis: But I wouldn't be opposed to 25/40/50
[1:59:33] MABER_FETT: low key I wish the WOTLK classic stayed, was not a fan of Cata
[1:59:33] soulraeper: They should do a perma legion classic
[1:59:36] Aidler: just OG classic stays
[1:59:59] ClassicMalcontent: Retail/Modern is fine. SoD is fine. Classic Era is fine. I'll miss Wrath though but I'm not into HC nor Cata 'classic'
[2:00:16] Nerendis: Oh, I'm so fucking hyped dude. Like I can't explain.
[2:00:42] Proto_Paradigm: @Towelliee if they take the "do whatever" from Ascension WoW, I think i'll be done with retail for a long while.

[2:00:56] DunzoCD: Cata is the stepping stone to MoP, which lots who started in Legion and only heard about MoP will play
[2:01:15] Wulfgrym: blizzard proving, the only thing that beats wow is wow
[2:01:16] turtlequad4: SeemsGood SeemsGood SeemsGood SeemsGood SeemsGood SeemsGood SeemsGood SeemsGood
[2:01:23] ArcaneSyntax: I feel like every version of wow after wrath is just worse retail.
[2:01:36] ClassicMalcontent: @MABER_FETT same. I want Wrath ever era.
[2:01:47] sprert: wow is like pizza. even the worst version ist still pizza and that is pretty good
[2:01:57] ClassicMalcontent: I want my Wrath toons enshrined. Wrath was the reason I even tried a private WoW server.
[2:02:07] ArcaneSyntax: @sprert excellent comparison
[2:02:35] soulraeper: I think cata will be more successful than wrath
[2:02:43] ClassicMalcontent: @sprert sure but Cata 'classic' or beyond are no longer classic and thats a version I'm done 'eating'
[2:02:45] Nokterian: For many Cata was there first expansion
[2:02:50] Shuttlestomp: *coffee cheers* people only hate cata because of DS. The beginning of that expansion was amazing
[2:02:54] Wulfgrym: true
[2:02:56] nyrkkikyllikki_: cata WutFace WutFace
[2:02:57] soulraeper: and MoP classic will be even better
[2:02:58] DunzoCD: I think the changes could be really good for cata
[2:03:00] Aidler: @sprert how does pineapple pizza fit into that equation?
[2:03:14] Buttscratchrr: Been here since the start towHAMUP
[2:03:16] Nerendis: I've played every expac because I'm a FUCKING nerd. Started in 2004 as an 11 year old.
[2:03:21] ClassicMalcontent: @Shuttlestomp I enjoyed the NEW CATA zones and new things I hated the destruction of the original world.
[2:03:24] BaldSpiceTV: I left after wrath for awhile so I may actually come back to classic to try cata for the “first”time
[2:03:31] Wulfgrym: i played wotlk and returned in mop, so i never played cata myself
[2:03:41] soulraeper: casual is good
[2:03:49] Baladore: 100%
[2:03:52] Molvonos: @Aidler https://i.imgur.com/pnSvMJs.jpg
[2:03:56] Zerodur1: No LFD in wrath was the specific reason i didnt play it lol
[2:03:59] Nokterian: We are getting older and time is shorter
[2:04:06] Elderpug27: casual players like me need lfr lol
[2:04:07] cman1033: I started playing because my GF made me watch the Make Love Not Warcraft episode of South Park

[2:04:08] ArcaneSyntax: I'm not really looking forward to it, but I'll probably play cata classic a bit
[2:04:10] Baladore: @Zerodur1 Same
[2:04:11] sdpercussion: do these classic versions have aoe looting?
[2:04:26] ClassicMalcontent: I'm glad Cata Classic is coming for those who want it. But they 100% should hold a Wrath era as it was a reason for the popularity of private servers.
[2:04:40] Molvonos: @ClassicMalcontent Never going to happen, lol.
[2:04:40] Baladore: gamma alpha
[2:04:42] Baladore: etc
[2:04:44] Gigagrayz: What up Towelliee? You you finish the birthday strong?
[2:04:45] alatryste: Is paladin sod good for tanking?
[2:04:45] Shuttlestomp: @ClassicMalcontent I get that. For me, I felt that destruction from Deathwing throughout the zones made it feel so epic. created the real sense of fear that the world could end
[2:04:48] DBtheAlien: do you have an import template for your UI layout?
[2:04:54] Aidler: @molvonos that thing doesn’t look too good LUL
[2:05:01] wEiRdO_dUdE: People like the gammas, from what I've seen
[2:05:04] ArcaneSyntax: @alatryste yes
[2:05:19] DunzoCD: challenge modes were lit
[2:05:24] ClassicMalcontent: @Molvonos thats fine. It just means I'm done with supposed-classic that isn't Classic era or variants or TBC/Wrath.
[2:05:29] Molvonos: @Aidler Kinda like what a lot of what nostalgia-psychos want with the Classic experience.  Not appealing at all, lol
[2:05:48] Aidler: yeah
[2:05:49] Baladore: Basically their version of M+
[2:05:53] Moonori: gammas are casual, cm weren't really
[2:06:02] N3llee: no poe?
[2:06:47] wEiRdO_dUdE: There was a big queue at first, too
[2:06:48] Moobot:  Towelliee.com has all of your Towelliee news WoW UI addon information, and merchandise collection. Check it out!
[2:07:01] DunzoCD: yeah that was one of the rougher PoE launches performance wise
[2:07:07] SpidercowSD: @Towelliee Watched or played any Throne and Liberty? I See some people checking it out?
[2:07:39] ClassicMalcontent: @Shuttlestomp oh no doubt. My biggest thing, if they added Chromie Time walking to grant old zones back to Retail, I'd probably never even have touched classic era at all. Until SoD at least.
[2:07:56] BenInYa: what’s a decent gearscore for gammas?
[2:08:07] Snappole_: in classic it'll be like sfk dagger HR or full on clothies
[2:08:18] ClassicMalcontent: @Shuttlestomp I just wanted some 'modern alts' to have the option to 'original WoW zones' level.
[2:08:19] Murphybrown: ultimatum league was the last time it was like that
[2:08:22] N3llee: I think PoE set a new record of concurrent players. Last I saw it was like 187k
[2:08:37] kirkhill89: i am still having crashing issues
[2:08:42] Shuttlestomp: @ClassicMalcontent oh yeah I get that 100% and agree.
[2:08:43] SpidercowSD: @Towelliee I heard it was the MTXs, some are screen wide ect
[2:09:11] cyb0rg_007: new release bullshit is 50/50
[2:09:26] DunzoCD: Private server andys say they dont like retail because of the gatekeeping then proceed to gatekeep in classic KEKW
[2:09:27] Shuttlestomp: @ClassicMalcontent - I didn't think of that from an overall perspective. that is a good point.
[2:09:35] cyb0rg_007: most i get lucky now with servers being good
[2:10:01] cyb0rg_007: no play poe cause not really my style
[2:10:32] DunzoCD: SRS feels better when you get Unleash support and release more at a time
[2:11:12] CardinalTX: @towelliee playing on Crusader Strike Horde side the Barrens is FULL of hunter bots killing everything

[2:32:12] Azmaveth_Gaming: So not all are individual contributiions.
[2:32:22] trollinmyimp: yeah it's your money, they rely on the fact a certain amount of people won't use it all and they keep the remaining amount come Jan 1.
[2:32:39] RogueBear: yeah, FSA/HSA they just deduct a portion of your pay into a special account. sometimes your employer will match a percentage of it

[2:41:17] cyrex172: i can finally buy bg 3 for my xbox,,, but its 70 bucks... i cant afford it im crushed
[2:41:17] MasqureMan: alan wake 2 took quite a few too

[2:41:39] wEiRdO_dUdE: Zelda fans in shambles
[2:41:44] Pups_Gersky: Alan Wake 2 got quite a few
[2:41:45] cyrex172: i wanna play bg3 but nothing is taking me away from classic anytime soon
[2:41:53] mavericks312: the dude who plays kratos said his winning speech last year was longer then the current CoD campaign
[2:41:54] Proto_Paradigm: @Towelliee CoD devs got salty about a joke Christopher Judge made
[2:41:54] skymercii: GOW VA roasted cod for having a 5 hour campaign for $70
[2:41:57] Syllvn: They were very aggressive with the 'get off the stage' music and message. You can literally see it on a screen behind Devs after 30s
[2:42:06] ashwing_: Yeah because it was not really the awards but a washed out version of E3
[2:42:29] FlameStryke: ya they got like 30 secs and then the music played that was all due to christopher Judge taking 8 mins last year
[2:42:36] N3llee: @Towelliee did you see the wrap up screen they had?
[2:42:38] N3llee: omg
[2:42:42] mavericks312: but they gave Kojima and peele a 6 minute interview
[2:42:47] N3llee: Yea they were brutal
[2:42:59] cyrex172: i honestly give 0 fucks about the vga's
[2:43:02] N3llee: But honestly they kept the show to 3hrs
[2:43:05] N3llee: instead of 4
[2:43:06] Syllvn: It was crazy aggressive
[2:43:09] N3llee: and theat to me felt ok
[2:43:11] 07biby: yeah, they were being jerks...
[2:43:16] abracka_: anthony mackie’s thing was giga cringe
[2:43:24] Brodih_: and the security was tight near the stage, 5 huge guys watching who was walking to the stage
[2:43:25] miniRoach: like that one guy in chat. "please play the game"

[2:43:44] zwulf: its Anthiny Mackie that dude is always cringe off screen
[2:43:48] magenof: It was really bad when they did "the wrap up now" when the GOTY winners talked about devs they lost as close as last month due to illness.
[2:43:53] 07biby: depends on how good of a friend u are with geoff
[2:43:55] xsp00n: Cohh had a rant about this, cause its literally 1 guy that set up the whole event, and its either this, or nothing at all. so we take what we can get
[2:44:11] FlameStryke: ya exactly
[2:44:14] SamuraiWillZ916: makes me think of the dave chapelle skit lol

[2:44:42] N3llee: Someone gift me a sub plz. The ads are killing me .. x9 x2 30mins inbetween
[2:44:46] ashwing_: Gotta give the shitty Fallout show more time ofc
[2:44:54] FlameStryke: ya their lead art designer died and they didn't give af about him
[2:45:07] magenof: they need the money apparently
[2:45:07] Syllvn: The celebrities are unneeded
[2:45:08] Elijahss: I think people watch it for the previews
[2:45:14] jkitchin75: @N3llee dont beg bro
[2:45:14] Brodih_: its the only ''relevant'' game award show now

[2:45:21] Osilon33: more and more celebs are getting on twitch more... athletes etc its crazy
[2:45:22] Calphurnious: Yeah, idgaf about the celebs
[2:45:24] Zerodur1: Most of the new stuff was meh, the new no mans sky game looks sick though
[2:45:36] CrunkyBrewster: I honestly forgot it was even an awards show
[2:45:36] FlameStryke: Dude @N3llee just open the small window during the ads and blow it up and unmute it
[2:45:40] Syllvn: We have plenty of like game Dev celebs they could use
[2:45:40] zwulf: yeah but ANthony mackie is in the twisted metal show and Mathew is gonna be in a game same with Simu, but yeah they had to much time
[2:45:40] Nekkromonger: Exactly, we don't need the MTV Awards 2.0
[2:45:44] 07biby: tbh, i ignored everything celeb related
[2:45:44] CrunkyBrewster: it felt more like an E3
[2:45:45] FlameStryke: Ez ad skip
[2:45:55] Zerodur1: Yeah that one looks insane too
[2:45:56] homewrecker101: OD
[2:46:04] Calphurnious: @Zerodur1 Hoping it's more polished out the gate then NMS
[2:46:04] 07biby: they diddnt need all that time for kojima tho
[2:46:14] xsp00n: new monster hunter hypu
[2:46:17] N3llee: @FlameStryke mine doesnt work that way
[2:46:23] Pups_Gersky: Yea I can't wait to see who other devs are going to be working on OD that they mentioned will be name dropped later.
[2:46:28] REALPolarbeezy: I watched the highlights, streamlines it
[2:46:29] FlameStryke: why not?
[2:46:37] Syllvn: They do
[2:46:38] FlameStryke: use Firefox bra dump edge
[2:46:40] mavericks312: you mean the interactive movie Kojima is making?
[2:46:43] mrelgaato: mrelgaato gifted a Tier 1 sub to N3llee! They have given 95 Gift Subs in the channel! 
[2:46:45] Nerendis: It used to be super long, and then they made it super short, but as of last year they've made it more reasonable
[2:47:06] magenof: How kojimbo hasn't learned english yet with how much he fraternizes with English celebs is beyond me :p
[2:47:16] zwulf: hasnt Kojima been one of the biggest supporters of TGA
[2:47:18] trenothy: OD
[2:47:23] FlameStryke: ya I don't worry about ads
[2:47:36] zwulf: like yeah he had to much time but he has supported them the most
[2:47:39] FlameStryke: ya its just a culture thing
[2:47:48] Brodih_: kojima knows english, hed rather speak japanese because its more flued for him
[2:47:52] ZomBiE519: Anderson Silva does that
[2:47:52] Nerendis: The vast majority of non americans have a very strong understanding of English....
[2:47:55] FlameStryke: makes him feel important too
[2:48:02] Nerendis: Kinda racist to assume he doesn't know english
[2:48:16] zwulf: imagine wanting to speak in your first language crazy
[2:48:30] FlameStryke: you forgot duskwood too
[2:48:31] RogueBear: might be that as a 2nd language it just takes more effort to speak it and carry on a conversation
[2:48:45] Pups_Gersky: The questline of there and back again x 30. lol
[2:48:47] Nekkromonger: @Nerendis Totally not true
[2:48:56] akuma_46: people should learn Japanese instead
[2:49:05] magenof: The Finnish and Belgian studios who accepted rewards didn't do it in Dutch or whatever

[2:50:55] Broomba: there is a movie called 8 bit Christmas @towelliee its about getting a NES back in the 1980s with Neil Patrick Harris -- you would love it
[2:51:17] RogueBear: in my time living in the south, ive managed to learn enough spanish to tell someone i dont speak spanish lol
[2:51:30] Maruika: the wizard is the best video game movie of all time imo
[2:52:09] Nerendis: @zwulf Yes, I am. I didn't say fluency or anything along those lines. I said a huge amount of people understand english to a sufficient level. The original topic was "why hasn't Koji learned English". When you could have assumed he understands it fairly well.
[2:52:15] cyrex172: that rein was so cool
[2:52:23] No_Panda: as a licensed Ukrainian-English interpreter in the UK, I can't interpret for my mother, it's a violation here

[2:52:45] cyrex172: i wonder how much that chop will sell for

[2:52:47] curlytopcoffee: The Mario Movie?
[2:52:48] cyrex172: cho gall
[2:52:51] Maruika: im pretty sure it was the super mario 3 release announcement
[2:52:53] ZomBiE519: Slater was in that movie

[2:53:48] SaulMDGaming: Isnt that the movie that taught everyone about the flutes in the game? or did it just teach me? lol i think i was 5 or something
[2:53:57] CrunkyBrewster: I know Paul was in some weird Horror movie about turning into a Dinosaur LUL
[2:54:26] ZomBiE519: Jackey Vinson was the bully in Wizard

[2:55:27] CrunkyBrewster: nah its not him
[2:55:32] magenof: @Nerendis either he knows english, and he speaks it at those awards, or he doesn't and I feel thats a bit lame considering the amount of time he spends as a westaboo. People just excuse him cause he's japanese, while there are 100 of devs trying their best using english at the awards
[2:55:32] BloodAngel420: No
[2:55:35] Broomba: his character was Lucas

[2:58:00] Bowwjack: @Towelliee you will for the mana and DS is an 8 sec cd
[2:58:02] UfDeej: i never even use my taunt honestly, generate to much threat as it is with pally kit
[2:58:20] ZomBiE519: hand of reckoning isn't just a taunt, it gives you mana when you are healed and buffs your righteous fury more than the talent does, by a lot

[7:40:02] bigstick258: what does their pitching look like?
[7:40:11] Lloydbanksz: dodgers number 1 team ever
[7:40:18] Aidler: expensive players don’t necessarily make a good team
[7:40:19] ghostex36: Well…they are in the same division with the Rockies,m, so we know they’ll win those games. LUL LUL LUL
[7:40:30] TheeCableguy: It's the guaranteed that's important? Do we have a number?

[7:40:40] alphabot357: I knew everyone crying that the Jays were going to sign him were crazy.
[7:40:48] Alaquane: but he aint "just" a pitcher
[7:40:51] kingdaddy96: @aidler Yankees are the prime example of that statement
[7:40:52] alphabot357: Dodgers wouldn't let anyone out bid them.
[7:40:57] trivotix: no way would I pay him. I was so happy when the Rangers did not get him. I am a huge fan of his but not the price tag. You could get like 5 decent players for that salary
[7:40:59] Treevinal: primal empowered is part of the seasonal
[7:40:59] mavericks312: there in a division with the rockies,padres and giants they easily win that division

[7:42:05] Thoreya: ohtani to the dodgers
[7:42:12] Thoreya: 10 yrs 700 mill
[7:42:12] dropsorgtfo: @mavericks312 still a luxury tax
[7:42:14] PotbellyGoat: I still have a Leaf dual auto /10 of Ohtani and Acuna coming
[7:42:17] alphabot357: Imagine if he never pitches again.
[7:42:33] mavericks312: teams like the yanks,phils,dodgers etc can afford the luxury tax
[7:42:50] mavericks312: @alphabot357 he is still going to hit 50+ bombs
[7:42:53] Verdell263: As a Giants fan, this signing just kills me
[7:43:06] trivotix: What about that Soto trade for 7 players? Was that the move for New York?
[7:43:06] kingdaddy96: I was hoping with the mariners dumping everyone they were going to get him. But now the M's management just looks horrid
[7:43:13] alphabot357: @mavericks312 and that's worth 700 mil over 10 years?
[7:43:23] dropsorgtfo: soto
[7:43:25] dropsorgtfo: dope
[7:43:44] mavericks312: @alphabot357 trout got 500 mill and ppl said that was a steal sooooo
[7:43:52] TheGiant99: only for them to lose to the astros in the playoffs again :)
[7:43:53] trivotix: 7 players for Soto though.
[7:44:09] Afterdark21: Verdugo is a stop gap until Jasson Domiguez is healthy.
[7:44:22] mavericks312: the only problem for the yanks now is resigning him an not letting him walk
[7:44:32] bigstick258: pitching lol losing 11-8 will be the theme
[7:44:37] alphabot357: @mavericks312 Ronald Acuna hit 41 this year and is on a 8year 100mil contract
[7:44:42] trivotix: Rangers will still be competitive next year. Bochy is a goat
[7:44:48] Broomba: is the other yankee players contract costing the organization to spend money? @towelliee have they reached the salary cap or refuse to upgrade and spend the money?
[7:44:56] ghostex36: Look…if the Rockies don’t do a full rebuild and FINALLY get rid of Bud Black, they will never be relevant. I hate being a fan of that team…I hate it.
[7:45:05] mavericks312: @alphabot357 yea because the braves signed him before he broke out like this year it was smart
[7:45:49] mavericks312: the braves sign all there young players long term early before they can get crazy deals like that
[7:46:18] alphabot357: @mavericks312 they signed him in 2019 when he also had 41 hr and 101 rbis
[7:46:30] PolarDBear: PolarDBear subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 6 months! 
[7:47:23] mavericks312: @alphabot357 look at rileys contract as well he is super under payed for his production
[7:47:47] Treevinal: may be dex
[7:48:01] Nokterian: towHAMUP towHAMUP towHAMUP towHAMUP towHAMUP
[7:48:16] trivotix: Take care Towelliee
[7:48:22] Dragunstorm15: Rippin cards tomorrow?
[7:48:29] Rakim88: 700m for 10yrs WTF how r dodgers affording this
[7:48:35] TheItalianStallion321: wait he signed a $700 mil?
[7:48:40] TheItalianStallion321: dodgers? what the fuck
[7:48:45] Rakim88: MONEY ISNT REAL
[7:48:52] alphabot357: @mavericks312 I a 100% agree, with all of that but I am saying he is not worth 700 mil if he doesn't pitch again
[7:48:54] TheItalianStallion321: il never be able to afford another ticket to a game ever again
[7:48:54] trivotix: 50 mil
[7:48:58] mavericks312: soto isnt a 700 million player lol
[7:48:59] Broomba: Watch the dodgers wont make the playoffs
[7:49:00] fistphul: yeah Trout got 426 his last contract
[7:49:11] TheeCableguy: what's the guaranteed $$$ on the 700 though?
[7:49:27] mavericks312: acuna made the mistake in signing a long term deal early
[7:49:31] Alaquane: they took the cost of a pitcher and a batter and jsut added them together
[7:49:32] Rakim88: soto is still 500m min so gl yankees
