[1:57:17] Aegllor: ofcourse, i'll be at work. sadge
[1:58:20] BobLongMVP: What are the most noob-friendly mythic 10+? I did a few temple of the jade serpent runs and each one was a struggle.
[1:58:28] BobLongMVP: Ranged dps.
[1:59:00] ScalarGaming: court and shadowmoon
[1:59:09] FlyingMammothTTV: shadowmoon burial grounds is by far the easiest
[1:59:40] BobLongMVP: aight cool ty
[2:00:24] Aegllor: I thought i remember hearing in interviews there'd be a weekly quest tied to it
[2:00:34] TheGiant99: you guys think it will be locked behind renown
[2:00:38] metavahn231: Shadowmoon has alot of competition to get into key though, people wan to +3 it easily with good players
[2:00:48] instant_savage: there is no currency from i have been told, its just once a week
[2:01:01] LeDerpski: Pretty sure its just a weekly quest. No currency
[2:01:54] metavahn231: blizzard got hammered in SL, they will listen to us for awhile atleast
[2:02:02] aleck1776: Theres a wild Earth Ele
[2:02:06] metavahn231: which means not to much stupid grinds i hope

[2:05:35] metavahn231: also why DH get these little bug fixes, while everyone else gets 3% nerfs
[2:05:49] tn_lukeduke: it's cooler to play a off meta character
[2:05:56] lorddrekken: wheres the quality control lol
[2:05:57] tn_lukeduke: imo
[2:06:16] theDirtyon3: should should do the right thing and buff every class to the top
[2:06:19] theDirtyon3: Kappa
[2:06:56] nocturnal_2195: from what I heard about the catalyst from reading  there blizz post you get 1 charge per character per week if im not mistaken

[2:40:32] shale93: its never gonna happen in Pugs as long as CR/BL exist on specific classes
[2:40:38] Molvonos: Clearly the 1%ers need to take Brewmasters.
[2:40:41] ThePawPaw: right Kappa
[2:40:41] Voltaictv: Its called a meta for a reason lmao
[2:40:47] nevercluckyy: they should make an affix called nightmare every 30 seconds a random member of group gets a debuff and if not dispelled in 5 seconds it fears the whole group for 5 seconds make tight space trash packs extra spicy
[2:40:48] Tigerklaue: try to get a invite as a resto shaman
[2:41:05] Alienfromger: damn you influencers towRage
[2:41:24] notconscious: streamers simply have more time to figure out what the meta is. what a silly excuse
[2:41:43] ThePawPaw: done 20s but when? and to strugle is not fun
[2:41:49] NBK_Sethus: you design encounters that heavily favor certain specs and then get surprised that people prefer those specs...
[2:41:52] Pups_Gersky: Blame the rogues.
[2:42:03] tronbadgames: this is basically like theorycrafting, there will always be a part of the player base that figures out the competitive edge. people will follow that. it's just streamed now

[3:22:49] metavahn231: there's a thing called disposable income, and for some people they have ALOT of it
[3:22:58] Molvonos: Got it
[3:23:12] Peqdevil: they prolly reduce time if they remove RP
[3:23:24] Molvonos: People would still prefer not having RP more.
[3:23:37] elbinn: gotta give this guy the whole hog
[3:23:38] SoulToned: had this shit happen to me on a 19 the other day with the rp
[3:23:43] Brock3ra: U wont do it
[3:23:43] lawles_walrus: should the timer stop for RP? Hot take: yes
[3:23:47] Molvonos: It's M+, not Uncle Chuckles Nostalgia trip.

[3:24:08] FranciscoTheMage: but if thats the case why wouldnt they remove the train from grimrail
[3:24:17] lawles_walrus: i think either find a way to remove the RP or stop the timer during RP
[3:24:20] jrossino: To m33
[3:24:40] ThePawPaw: timed nice
[3:24:53] FranciscoTheMage: like 20 secs left
[3:25:03] metavahn231: dammit i need that helm

[3:25:28] Pups_Gersky: All RP needs to be removed from M+ dungeons.

[3:26:25] Masqerader: remember when HOV was 45m
[3:26:28] Masqerader: good times
[3:26:29] metavahn231: blizzard is giving a very big vibe of being lazy
[3:26:38] lawles_walrus: how hard would it to be to code the timer stopping for RP?
[3:26:38] Avalan09: GeT tO tHe Rp FaStEr
[3:26:38] FranciscoTheMage: the RP can be different?
[3:26:42] lawles_walrus: i feel its an easy update

[3:26:45] Peqdevil: how do we know the timer isnt adjusted to include RP,
[3:26:45] metavahn231: like they fix the profound issues and thats it
[3:26:48] Alienfromger: i think they calculated rp in the timer
[3:26:48] Kaype92: Honestly azure vault has no RP and they still need to extend that timer
[3:26:55] jrossino: RP adds +1 difficulty
[3:27:09] jerseyfive: timer def include this stuff, it's just annoying and should be disabled so we dont have to watch ist 200 times
[3:27:09] cravo: The RP is taken into account in the timers. No keys are bricked because of RP.
[3:27:10] jrossino: @kaype92 dungeon is trash
[3:27:10] jkitchin75: are ms still buying blizz?
[3:27:14] TheNextKing306: RP should be the next seasonal affix!!
[3:27:22] ChalupaBatman25: agreed, if you are doing m+ its pretty obvious no one cares about the RP going on during the dungeon leave that for m0
[3:27:23] Piebringer619: WHY HAVE RP IN competitive
[3:27:29] Kaype92: @jrossino it really is
[3:27:30] Needdaann: RP > M+ progression Kappa
[3:27:33] shale93: I would take hour of CoS RP over AV anyday KEKW
[3:27:37] Voltaictv: RP has no place in a competitive environment
[3:27:42] Alienfromger: while RP you can regen mana :)
[3:28:07] metavahn231: imagine MDI using court of stars or halls of valor, would be a horrible MDI KEKW
[3:28:20] Kaype92: Then on the flip side SBG is such a joke that our tank DC’d for SIX minutes yesterday in there and still timed it waiting afk for him to come back
[3:28:31] cravo: Vaults and RLP have no RP and they are by far the most bricked keys, especially in add week.
[3:28:54] Masqerader: @cravo vaults is just to big
[3:29:01] Masqerader: and u waste a lot of time flyting on books
[3:29:04] metavahn231: blizzard would have no comment Kappa
[3:29:24] shale93: vaults can suck my dick, took me like 10 attempts to even time 19
[3:29:31] olyv12: When can you collect from the vault?
[3:29:46] ChalupaBatman25: tomorrow
[3:29:50] metavahn231: vault just needs you to spawn at the spiral platforms when you die, not the beginning of the dungeon with a useless speed buff
[3:29:56] Aegllor: i need lots of 16s to upgrade my crafted gear. but this week has not been my week for dungeons lmao.
[3:30:08] Kaype92: Blizzard actually did fix the Temple first boss death RP so no reason they shouldn’t fix all the others
[3:30:17] Aegllor: i do have a 17 av but idk how i'd do with it haha
[3:30:19] metavahn231: you cant even take the books in vault when your group is in combat LUL
[3:31:16] altair19992: bruh gearing alts is so Sadge
[3:31:25] JustinSutherby: brewmaster felling better
[3:31:30] shale93: I mean its almost BiS item 10 is fine imo
[3:31:36] shale93: 3 would be so free
[3:31:37] Kaype92: RIP Academy this week with tree boss AND explosives
[3:31:52] metavahn231: that would be kind of crazy for people with money though, youd have legions of 418 guys right out of the game
[3:32:13] Sandisy: yeah, going to hold off on academy until the hotfix goes out
[3:32:17] metavahn231: out of the gate*

[3:50:50] NBK_Sethus: tbh at this point I think Blizzard should be hosting the event, giving guilds preset characters or allowing them to ban specs to each other, etc. it would spice things up immensely.
