[6:25:29] FreckFPS: i dont think its bad
[6:25:30] OrganikCum: no fun runes
[6:25:34] THOMALEX: i would love heroic leap or second wind <<<<<<<<<
[6:25:39] ShagyTV: i liked adding some sort of rotation to raiding
[6:25:39] ohkay710: i like devestate
[6:25:42] Mikeyloks: nothiung warriors fduck
[6:25:43] CorkeLoL: great design just like the hindenberh
[6:25:45] Mikeyloks: suck
[6:25:45] kigami_uro: warbringer
[6:25:45] ohkay710: and them bringing back swoard and board
[6:25:47] CorkeLoL: hindenberg
[6:25:47] ohkay710: sword
[6:25:48] badman1030: sleeping bag
[6:25:50] Tdoh__: victory rush
[6:25:51] FreckFPS: maybe only warriors can speak on it but im happy that warriors are still gear prio
[6:25:51] Civix_1802: i mean... they are viable at low lvl
[6:25:53] ShagyTV: but the open world pvp is feel bad
[6:25:54] petraclese: There is nothing interesting. its all passives and they blow
[6:25:54] Hatch_NZ: vic rush made solo early levels easier
[6:25:59] THOMALEX: i would love heroic leap or second wind < this is what we need
[6:26:00] gandyAU: fristfire baby
[6:26:01] DjPyro: @badman1030 KEKW
[6:26:03] Butterybo: the consumed by rage mechanic, how it is more fun to rage dump
[6:26:05] gandyAU: frostfgire*
[6:26:05] HoustonSippers: Boring. Give me wonky shit, like a battle mage or healer/fighter cleric
[6:26:09] tyresemicah: Second wind!
[6:26:10] gandyAU: frostfire**
[6:26:13] Kusig: did they not get the rune to increase defensive stance damage by 10%?
[6:26:14] Shepp22: I main Druid, warriors have been leveled out compared to other classes and it seems underwhelming from warrior perspective. my real take
[6:26:14] HoustonSippers: warriors just do more warrior shit
[6:26:15] Snub34: I played warrior for many years but didn't feel the call to play it on SoD... look borring to me.
[6:26:18] grilledcheeseistasty: @SONII  what do u think of streamers getting carried constantly in wow on stream?
[6:26:22] THOMALEX: second wind or heroic leap is what we need
[6:26:22] merzle1019: pretty sure they're saving heroic leap for later phase
[6:26:28] merzle1019: no shot they don't bring that rune
[6:26:28] Dogarian: @ohkay710 go on wowhead and lookup in search bar "sword and board" thats supposed to be a rune inc   it's on devastate/revenge use u have 30% chance to reset ur Shield Slam CD and make it cost no rage.
[6:26:29] Snub34: maybe 40-50 will be more fun than 25 at least
[6:26:37] FreckFPS: @grilledcheeseistasty no one cares tbh :)
[6:26:42] cjadude: passive aggression detected
[6:26:43] ogMansoN: sony is carrying these guys with his ashkandi
[6:26:45] sberdahger: soni is the carry
[6:26:46] grilledcheeseistasty: like literally afking
[6:26:48] pmcenile: i still have fun but definiitely not as flashy as some other classes
[6:26:50] Lopnk: dungeon boosting.. shobek.. ahmpy.. i mean the list goes on lol
[6:26:58] HoustonSippers: This guy is top of the damage meter, he's clearly getting carried 😭
[6:27:03] ZerfOG: sshobek got fly hackers boosting him lmfao
[6:27:11] CwoodAGG21: shobek? dude is legit
[6:27:12] FreckFPS: @ZerfOG quite the accusation
[6:27:20] Lopnk: shobek did like 25 rogues to 25.. half of them were just dungeon boosted while he talked LOL
[6:27:23] FreckFPS: thats a little wierd if true
[6:27:24] Dodie324: moonfirebeam multi boxing 3 accounts putting chars on follow
[6:27:25] theKinaid: what if we put you in a sleeping bag, and we just cuddle? is that stream carrying?

[6:35:04] Shepp22: Joaquin came to Ridley Scott a week before filming and said “i have no idea what I’m doing with this character” so it coulda been worse but they did their best
[6:35:28] FreckFPS: i think the writing was the problem not the performances @Shepp22
[6:35:58] FreckFPS: just seemed silly to focus on his love life rather than his "accomplishments:
