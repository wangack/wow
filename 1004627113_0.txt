[0:33:56] BlueBeast33: He does not like that they added a bunch of torments back when they removed them in the beta already due to negative feedback
[0:33:57] aWizardStick: is prepatch gonna have tbc lvling?
[0:34:56] r234t: its also in ou nature to tend towards optimisnbias
[0:35:04] Askinas: Is there a date on pre-patch?

[1:18:59] artun16: will we be able to buy the boost when pre patch lands? or we have to wait until TBC launch
[1:19:14] TombStoneMercenary: Do you see them adding servers like they did with classic to help with the tourists and server wait times?
[1:20:13] Moobot: All giveaways can be found on our Discord under the #Stream channel! discord.gg/towelliee
[1:20:23] Artivicii: wouldve been nice if they staggered it farther apart

[1:21:22] BillNyeTheGaminGuy: oh within a week easy
[1:21:31] mitchumtx: That's what people are not seeing when it comes to this content drought, we are in a middle of a pandemic, of course there will be delays..said obstacle Ion was talking about
[1:22:14] mitchumtx: True, not thinking before they say something.
[1:22:21] TombStoneMercenary: Do you think BC will stay populated longer than classic?
[1:22:25] king_julian_96: yeah ion even stated that they still are having to work from home
[1:22:29] 210Crawler: He knows people!
[1:22:44] Noshpan: We are Jon Snow when it comes to those things
[1:23:36] Kaype92: @Towelliee You still gonna play swtor? There's new content released for it today

[1:23:48] TombStoneMercenary: Yeah classic is rough if you are not willing to pay for a run you are pretty much SOL
[1:23:57] ernek_bt: bro is a good time to come back to WOW ? @Towelliee
[1:23:57] wdotk: so with classic will blizzard keep revamping old expansions ? is that their plan ?
[1:24:06] Artivicii: farming netherwing eggs KEKW
[1:24:10] Saucetonia: !givaways
[1:24:47] Artivicii: SSC boss fights were suuuuper fun
[1:25:04] TombStoneMercenary: Would you like to see blizz put a slow to all the boosting spam?
[1:25:49] PadidinJones: @Towelliee would you play WoW on a Unreal engine?
[1:25:53] wdotk: maybe late this year blizzard will hint out what new expansion will be coming out after SL
[1:26:08] xaeblue: I'd like to see the bots slowed (kek), and it would reduce the hostility towards boosters.
[1:26:11] king_julian_96: So you donâ€™t think they will do a cata classic
[1:26:13] deucezmongooses: boosting is inevitable. literally in every game
[1:26:15] deucezmongooses: just like cheating
[1:26:36] Saucetonia: I'd probably play cata classic
[1:26:37] Noshpan: Expansion after Shadowlands will be Endbringers Kappa
[1:26:47] Myrror: I would love to see mop servers my favorite raiding and class tuning but I know there needs to be a cut off
[1:27:00] sathreindis: Cata Reforge
[1:27:08] captain_steve_rogers: Cata Reforged
[1:27:09] Artivicii: id pass
[1:27:21] Noshpan: I wouldn't. I would stop at Wrath
[1:27:26] VrtniPatuljak: Legion classic
[1:27:28] 210Crawler: Wotlk is too much imo
[1:27:32] dracullus: I would play Legion Classic just to repeat some Mage Towers
[1:27:34] TombStoneMercenary: Just find it funny that people are all grab the pitchforks when it comes to LFR and LFG since it "hurts the community" but are willing to pay someone to sit at the start and run it for them...
[1:27:36] mitchumtx: Cata was not the great
[1:27:46] mitchumtx: that*
[1:27:48] TactileCurve: retail has me so mad im eating a bigmac LOL
[1:27:55] Artivicii: unreal engine 4 graphics 4Head
[1:28:09] cineris_3: has the old style talent trees, that's about it
[1:28:14] PadidinJones: I mean it would be nice to reminisce of Cata when it was released with everyone mobing the flight trainer and you having to /tag the trainer but it got kinda boring after a while
[1:29:03] Dynwor: classic ended when they change the talent systems

[1:29:45] BillNyeTheGaminGuy: yea they will probably go up to wrath and then come out with new servers so poeple can do it over and over again for all 3 expansions
[1:30:01] mebobbumman: I just wish they could make time walking where your spells and talent trees are like they were for the expansion they were in. Just give us the dungeons and raids then.

[1:41:29] Kelticlore: they may change there mentality when they see less subs
[1:41:29] TombStoneMercenary: ^SL
[1:41:41] LawnSpeaker: They should change the fundamental structure of how they do expansions
[1:41:48] Kaype92: It's not Blizzard anymore unfortunately, it's mainly Activision controlling them

[1:45:11] crawcook: When it comes to game decisions Ion shouldnâ€™t be reporting to anyone
[1:45:14] Blistz1: doesn't ion have to talk to John hight for decision making
[1:45:26] Kaype92: Hey man i don't really care what Blizzard does in 9.1 as long as my survival hunter gets a mega buff and I can actually do things with it optimally everywhere I'll be happy

[1:47:03] kenphil: imagine being director and can't make decisions lul
[1:47:44] mmzy_: 9.1 looks promising but that was also the case with shadowlands launch.. guess its just wait and see
[1:47:50] Kromede: Booby Overlord
[1:47:54] Blistz1: @kenphil He makes decisions on how things he belives should be but most of the case john usually agrees to them but may disagree them
[1:48:00] Catspaw66: lets face it. any descions Ion makes just needs to ensure it'll pad those bonus cheques for Bobby K.
[1:48:02] Kromede: ups i meant Bobby Overlord
[1:48:06] GrandMof: you'd be surprised at how much power marketing teams have at these companies
[1:48:27] TombStoneMercenary: I know people were so ready for SL it just felt really basic at launch and it seems like Blizz cant really catch up. Thats kinda why I was wondering if they took a month or two more would of helped....
[1:48:37] Blistz1: bruh that video of john hight regarding patch 8.2. He was stoned af

[1:51:24] Jermo11: corruption was hilarious doing like 70% of ur dmg :D
[1:51:32] Alexakosgg: did u guys look the new gear set its fucking dope
[1:51:47] Blistz1: Where at
[1:52:01] Anguyen92ab: That's a sad state of affairs when it comes to that in the next patch
[1:52:02] mmzy_: Yea corruption was funny.. but not funny in pvpðŸ˜‚
[1:52:04] Blistz1: im sad we couldnt test the boss last week testing
[1:52:09] Blistz1: i hope we test 4 bosses
[1:53:17] Skizzurp: u think they releasing TBC before 9.1?
[1:53:19] shamscam: @Towelliee you think they're going to release BC before they even release 9.1?
[1:53:20] Anguyen92ab: It's a weird thing.  I got less than a month left on my sub.  Don't feel like renewing it, but I suddenly have the urge to push for keystone master.  Got 1k in IO score.  Might as well go all the way.
[1:53:20] Alexakosgg: who is the last boss on new raid?
[1:53:22] Hitokiri83: they might wanna see if the servers will be stable enough for it
[1:53:27] Alexakosgg: sylvanas?
[1:53:46] mmzy_: I think pre patch tbcâ€”-> 9.1â€”-> tbc classic

[1:53:57] Myrror: new mythic plus seasonal affix hasn't even been revealed I wouldn't be surprised if we see that this week
[1:54:27] PadidinJones: Im just waiting for cinematics to get leaked
[1:54:39] Blistz1: @PadidinJones what cinamatics
[1:54:51] Anguyen92ab: Anything on Anduin?
[1:54:54] shamscam: @Towelliee sorry to ask again, but do you really believe that they won't release 9.1 until after they release classic BC?
[1:55:01] Blistz1: @PadidinJones i think thats fan made
[1:55:01] TombStoneMercenary: Free life lesson chat never ash a cigar while you sit in your boxers.....
[1:55:13] Alexakosgg: yeah what about the corrupted anduin?
[1:55:18] Alexakosgg: he is goign to be a boss?
[1:55:29] kenphil: what server you playing this warrior on @towelliee
[1:55:48] IllBarium: did you get the quests in the back of that cave?
[1:55:50] Blistz1: yep lol
[1:56:07] Blistz1: 9.2 next year
[1:56:28] Anguyen92ab: Was the question if there will be a 9.3 was ever addressed?
[1:56:33] Alexakosgg: omegalul
[1:56:34] r234t: tell me everything HahaPresent
[1:56:35] Kelticlore: how much of the 9.2 and 9.3 content will be cut you think
[1:56:35] PadidinJones: Anduin will 1 shot slyvanas and she will turn into the OG banshee again
[1:56:38] VoxDeMorte: any "must do's" or recommended preparation for classic players going into tbc?
[1:56:47] Anguyen92ab: Get to 60
[1:56:48] shamscam: @Towelliee that's just because that means that WoW is going like 8 months without a major patch in 9 months?
[1:56:55] Blistz1: They are putting more work on 9.2
[1:57:06] Alexakosgg: 9.1 when?
[1:57:11] Alexakosgg: july?
[1:57:36] Myrror: wouldn't be surprised if the new book sets up the story for 9.2 it comes out in November so a January or February 9.2 wouldn't surprise me
[1:57:37] Blistz1: what was it. WOD?
[1:57:52] constantinfive: never say never :)
[1:57:59] Catspaw66: until 10.0 ends up a 16 month delay due to world problems
[1:58:03] Blistz1: ohh
[1:59:10] PadidinJones: @Towelliee I think Blizzard is trying to recondition us for future plans in releasing content
[1:59:19] Alexakosgg: guys go check mythic  plate gear set is fucking dope
[1:59:45] Blistz1: holy shit, its been 1 year and 1 month since 6.2 and new Legion Xpac

[2:10:19] Moobot: All giveaways can be found on our Discord under the #Stream channel! discord.gg/towelliee
[2:10:23] rocthenite: the metaslaves in classic is what ruin classic for me in vannila
[2:10:24] UrSoDeAd2Me: WoW is a great game to binge for a while, take a break from, then get back into
[2:10:39] Waspire: its the 54-60 grind
[2:10:50] Waspire: sigh takes forever.
[2:11:17] xmedpakx: good kjeep ff14 on low pro
[2:11:24] Kromede: but but chocobos FeelsBadMan
[2:11:28] xmedpakx: its better being less played
[2:12:27] Catspaw66: FF14 just needs a personality streamer like Asmon to promote it.
[2:12:29] AcidAbyss: you passed a yellow under the tree like 30s ago
[2:12:31] soth_klf: you just went past a yellow
[2:12:31] Moobot: Check out Towelliee's latest Youtube video! https://youtu.be/U8-64zqVa8k Shadowlands needs some help
[2:12:41] Dynwor: in the ah
[2:12:57] Noshpan: I would have to say that one of the biggest flaws of the FFXIV community is that the shitty players do NOT like to be told how to improve their gameplay.
[2:13:20] Noshpan: And they certainly do NOT want to research it, either
[2:13:43] MagikPersn: MagikPersn subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 50 months! 
[2:14:02] AcidAbyss: dont they have a rule against toxicity in any form too so you cant tell them what to do/how to play or tell them to get good
[2:14:02] Moobot: Towelliee has not moved, he is renovating his streaming room over the next month or so. The stream will be scuffed, the audio will be different, but it will be worth it! Soonâ„¢
[2:14:37] Noshpan: FFXIV has a personality streamer: his name is MrHappy
[2:14:48] SavageCheez: I think they would lynch Asmon
[2:14:53] itsdibbles: FF14 started off fairly disliked. its been steadily improving over time. WoW started off strong, and had back to back hit xpacs that grew the shit out of the player base
[2:15:01] Ozzyminion: Imo what ffxiv lacks is endgame content beyond the story , it literally feels like it ends , the only source of in game communication is discord no global channels very limited interactionb
[2:15:17] xmedpakx: asmon is a tool though
[2:15:18] Fluaxx: Yeah that isn't true, xeno and arthars are just like your favorite wow streamer.
[2:15:19] Artivicii: slootAYAYA
[2:15:23] Kromede: ff14 has lalafels MiniK
[2:15:24] Spanos_: I just remember a 10 sec global cd
[2:15:36] Kelticlore: I detest asmon personaly
[2:15:50] xmedpakx: i dont dislike him,, he is just an ass
[2:15:52] Ozzyminion: Ffxiv doesnâ€™t feel farmable
[2:15:55] Ragura: roleplaying
[2:16:08] Dynwor: you going to play PSO 2 New game
[2:16:08] Moobot: TBC is around the corner! If you would like to join our community guild in classic while we prepare, we are on Azuresong Horde! Send a request message in the #WoW-TBC channel in Towelliee's discord and a recruiter will be in touch! || Towel will be switching to Belf Pally on prepatch || No TBC Launch date or prepatch date yet.
[2:16:28] itsdibbles: @ozzydaymo its actually easier to "farm" the endgame stuff, since you only need 8 peepos
[2:16:28] LawnSpeaker: couldn't they leverage the old content better though?
[2:16:32] Glozki: ff leans heavier on the rpg aspect for the storytelling and all that while wow is more on well everything else lol
[2:17:31] MucoXP: PSO on Dreamcast/Xbox was amazing
[2:17:32] Catspaw66: then there's the greatest near vaporware game ever... Star citizen
[2:17:52] Kelticlore: I am fine with Mythic Raiding the way it is
[2:17:55] SeamanSteven: SeamanSteven subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 13 months! 
[2:17:55] Ozzyminion: @itsdibbles yeah but I donâ€™t feel inclined to return to older low level zone and raids and farm them , I think it all comes down to time invested too
[2:18:04] Kelticlore: and i am not into doing Mythic raiding
[2:18:12] wvivar: Hows the remodeling going sorry to ask im sure you been asked havent been on for a few days.
[2:18:14] king_julian_96: What about mythic plus raiding
[2:18:22] Glozki: the new player in FF is fucking horid i will say that
[2:18:24] wvivar: off*
[2:18:34] Glozki: *aspect
[2:18:51] jontrann: Riots mmo can destroy wow if its good
[2:18:52] Kelticlore: Towelliee do you htink Dreamhaven could make a game that could give WOW a run for it smomey
[2:18:55] jontrann: it has the playerbase
[2:19:16] Blistz1: 5 years
[2:19:17] Ozzyminion: Itâ€™s dreamhaven purely tabletop?
[2:19:23] Blistz1: atleast
[2:19:24] Ozzyminion: Isnt*
[2:19:32] Blistz1: they have a huge fanbase tooo
[2:19:48] Catspaw66: could New world give wow some competition ? or just an also ran in waiting ?
[2:19:53] SavageCheez: Unless they've been working on it since ghostcrawler went to Riot
[2:19:53] Felrane: I dont think dreamhaven is going to make any type of MMOs
[2:19:59] Ayojonathan: Anymore key giveaways for tonight ? @towelliee
[2:19:59] jontrann: imagine if they did a pokemon mmo, that would be the biggest mmo in the world

[2:21:20] Blistz1: they have runeterra
[2:21:22] jontrann: riot already has a ton of lore lol
[2:21:34] wvivar: dire wolf is amazing. Dreanors wolfs are amazing!!! coolest mounts.
[2:21:35] Blistz1: Riot lore is already established
[2:21:41] Kromede: space, the final frontier
[2:21:50] AcidAbyss: yeah if i can be a druid like udyr changing forms thatd be cool
[2:22:10] Artivicii: lol grats

[2:35:38] Rudric_Ice: is valheim good as a solo player or is it better with friends ?

[2:36:29] TheUnknowing: It just wasn't enough talk about actual 9.1 content

[2:37:16] SavageCheez: Ion is the master of beating around the bush

[2:38:27] dracullus: imo interview wass worth it just for "git gud" answer
[2:38:31] Rudric_Ice: preach fucked up my DK man BibleThump
[2:38:40] Eltreum: i feel like preach cant really push much or these interviews wont happen anymore
[2:38:50] jamarky23: the problem is preach is a metaslave and hardcore player, so at the end of the day he doesnt ask the right question for the overall community for wow
[2:39:00] Dayszen: i really think ian is detached from the game regarding some systems
[2:39:01] jamarky23: questions*

[2:41:12] travrevyendk: no ptr build and no raid testing this week?
[2:41:18] preheats_lawyer: Yo towelliee, have u tried the new torghast on ptr? It's so trash...
[2:41:30] jamarky23: @chrslp Yeah been subbed for 23 months and been watching since 2016 on my other acc
[2:41:45] preheats_lawyer: I dislike the affixes

[2:42:09] travrevyendk: it's the first version chill
[2:42:30] skymercii: im here for it
[2:42:31] Kromede: yeah but no rewards meh
[2:42:39] mclovinzrp: what happened to the other room? havent been here in a while
[2:42:40] preheats_lawyer: Feels like they're going to make it more tedious. Right now I could just go in, get my soulash in 10 minutes and not touch it for the rest of the week. Now it feels like I have to play the shit to get my stars or unlock extra floors etc. etc.
[2:43:04] Skizzurp: @Kromede the rewards are new currency to upgrade leggos past 235
[2:43:36] preheats_lawyer: I meant those two extra floors for getting a good score in the run
[2:43:51] xmedpakx: dont play if it feels tedious?
[2:43:52] Moobot: Check out Towelliee's latest Youtube video! https://youtu.be/U8-64zqVa8k Shadowlands needs some help
[2:44:04] preheats_lawyer: @archaic78 I am forced to for my soul ash tho
[2:44:17] xmedpakx: no one can force you to do anything
[2:44:23] xmedpakx: you choose to
[2:44:32] travrevyendk: they tried that with twisting corridors but it turned out to be terrible
[2:44:35] preheats_lawyer: I am forced to if I want to raid or do end game content at a decent level
[2:44:49] xmedpakx: lol thats your choice friend
[2:44:57] preheats_lawyer: That's a dumb argument
[2:45:04] wheeze_dk: At first glance Torgast seemed like Greater Rifts from D3 to me.
[2:45:08] LtDanAndHisMagicLegs: Aren't the rewards the friends we made along the way?
[2:45:08] Rudric_Ice: could have given us a bit of gear from torghast but no ion doesn't like that either
[2:45:08] Kromede: upgrade legos and than never going in again, wasted content
[2:45:21] ahla03: how is soul ash a choice really. if someone raids/pvp he NEEDS soul ash
[2:45:45] JeffTheTank27: WB rotation was skethc though
[2:46:15] Rudric_Ice: Fuck RNG legion legendaries
[2:46:17] Kromede: sometimes legion legos still drop KEKW
[2:46:18] preheats_lawyer: Yeah lego acquisition in legion really sucked. The crafting is really nice and a huge improvement. I just dislike having it being a chore every week.
[2:46:19] wheeze_dk: What if ppl dont like it easy? :-D I like the progression part of games, don't want everything handed to me day 1.
[2:46:26] LtDanAndHisMagicLegs: @Towelliee Getting enough essence, buying random leggo, get speed boots. Thanks Ion.
[2:46:31] Wigoor: how does even BIS work in retail these days? do you go for a bis list or do you just sim new bis lists all the time? ðŸ¤”
[2:46:42] TheUnknowing: its Epic + Kappa
[2:46:58] dracullus: @Towelliee imo Legion system would be perfect if we could just target next legendary (or at least first one)
[2:47:04] Magdelia: @Towelliee whats with the new room what happen?
[2:47:07] CrunkyBrewster: see the problem isnt that we have to go do torghast for our leggo. its that we are capped by time it takes and difficulty. and the only thing tied to power progression is soul ash. thats my complaint
[2:47:08] wraaith: think thats the quest thats in the silithid hive
[2:47:09] fat_european0: Can you even call the current legnedaries legendary? Most of the effects are just tier sets or glyphs LUL
[2:47:13] Domini1001: @Towelliee  its not like a getting a piece of gear from blinghtron randomly can be considered getting a legendary or killing a rare mob on argus
[2:47:16] ahla03: @wigoor you sim pieces
[2:47:20] Ragura: same
[2:47:26] Ragura: i loved it
[2:47:55] CrunkyBrewster: yeah those wer efun times
[2:47:59] rocthenite: legion was fun, i haven't had fun in wow since imo
[2:48:03] fat_european0: There should be some bad luck protection if we do the Legion system though.
[2:48:08] Artivicii: bruh i was so lucky , first two leggos on my DH were BIS
[2:48:09] wheeze_dk: Yep, it's kinda boring now.
[2:48:10] Kromede: my warlocks first lego were the portal pants, so good Kappa
[2:48:11] chrisvee69: I remember when you got the lego in the mail in legion, that was so epic lol
[2:48:36] LtDanAndHisMagicLegs: @ChrisVee69 *retrieving item information*
[2:48:42] segarth: i find torghast to be really boring 80% of the time
[2:49:04] xmedpakx: aww but ppl cant complain if they get it too fast
[2:49:15] ahla03: one thing that is never mentioned at all and that is my opinion : torghast environment looks very boring. i'm so sad the raid will look like torghast...
[2:49:24] CrunkyBrewster: mmhmm
[2:49:30] segarth: NO CHANGES! Kappa
[2:49:36] benji6379: It seems  I
[2:49:47] benji6379: It seems I cannot join the discord`?
[2:49:48] wheeze_dk: I didn't step into Twisting once yet. :-D oh heck, that shit is not worth it.
[2:49:59] fat_european0: I feel like they should've made the changes to TC and give a bunch of cosmetic rewards to it
[2:50:14] xmedpakx: toys pets titles mount
[2:50:21] ahla03: ye but rewards doesn't really make the gameplay better. what if they put rewards into killing 10 enemies each day? it wouldnt make it fun

[2:50:30] benji6379: It says to react, but it won't let me react
[2:50:48] wheeze_dk: Islands ? where.
[2:50:50] fat_european0: I unironically preferred grinding islands all day for a week over doing torghast every week
[2:51:29] benji6379: Ah got it thanks
[2:51:32] CrunkyBrewster: see now with me i hated the islands. i hated it even that that one Azerite Power I wanted was tied to do the pvp islands. and i never got it done
[2:51:48] fat_european0: At least I could get get mounts and rare transmogs to sell for lots of gold in Islands. With Torghast I just get some soul ash
[2:51:56] Zolshy89: ez solo able
[2:52:03] LtDanAndHisMagicLegs: I had more fun doing Torghast over Islands. But that's like saying I had more fun stepping through micro machines than I did stepping through legos/
[2:52:06] Zolshy89: on mythic even
[2:52:08] dracullus: @Towelliee also Anima could be finally bearable with all buffs and flying
[2:52:14] xAlexEvans93x: who is this guy?
[2:52:34] segarth: anyone know if mythic guldan is soloable right now?
[2:52:34] fat_european0: I still dislike the new WQs
[2:52:38] Kromede: AYAYABASS https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0q0QeQbw9U
[2:52:39] rocthenite: i think another streamer can agree with you with a "TRUE DOOD"
[2:52:40] fat_european0: Just give us Legion or bfa WQs
[2:52:41] Jesperoni: yeah ngl going through older raids for mogs and mounts gives me nostalgia i never had
[2:52:44] Ragura: I miss Legion world quest
[2:52:56] Rudric_Ice: wish you could solo nzoth on mythic
[2:53:02] flafisa: fuck anima
[2:53:19] fat_european0: Honestly it's dumb that they tied anima catch up to the sanctum
[2:53:29] Malexand6742: Did you move?
[2:53:55] Lheela: Flying will make farming the optional open world reps in shadowlands viable, so people will actually do them. like hunting the inquisitors in revendreth

[2:56:15] fat_european0: Yeah that's true
[2:56:16] 2MakeMe: makes sense
[2:56:38] fat_european0: Do you think we'll get the next xpac announced this year then?
[2:56:46] jontrann: i'm still waiting for blizzard to make murlocs a playable race
[2:56:48] jontrann: like cmon bruh
[2:56:54] Jesperoni: no definitely not
[2:57:01] Artivicii: still waiting for my undead paladins
[2:57:14] BlueBeast33: You would think 10.0 would be something huge considering the milestone
[2:57:25] xaeblue: Just skip to the jailer, no one is interested.
[2:57:25] dracullus: @Towelliee do you think scraping a patch would give them enough time? around Legion they said expansion production has many bottlenecks and sometimes you can't just speed up things throwing more people
[2:57:33] Rudric_Ice: u really think they pull another WOD ?
[2:57:39] CrunkyBrewster: you just made me realize just how far behind Blizzard is right now. COVID really screwed them hard I would guess
[2:57:42] Jesperoni: uh lol why this guy gettin timed out when it's in the title xD
[2:57:44] Rudric_Ice: gonna*
[2:57:59] Lheela: Strangely enough however, I actually felt like trying to gear my character for the first time in a long time, bc 9.0 lasts long enough that it feels worth it
[2:58:02] preheats_lawyer: @dracullus I think it helped in Legion when they scrapped it in WoD
[2:58:14] Blistz1: so 11.0? is their milestone
[2:58:15] BlueBeast33: I could still see it being something pretty big, imagine an Azeroth revamp
[2:58:18] Jesperoni: ah okok i'm dumb
[2:58:48] xmedpakx: just release more achieves for mount collecting and i will be happier

[3:00:27] Rudric_Ice: Jailer will kill azeroth and it will be the end of WoW
[3:00:28] AnotherCheche: I didnt know there were tbc beta keys how do you get  one PogChamp
[3:00:35] fat_european0: I hope we go back to Azeroth in 9.2 i'm already tired of Shadowlands
[3:00:39] Artivicii: havent seen that before
[3:00:41] thelazysoldier: whats that addon u have for ur button to be bunched up like that?
[3:00:44] Kromede: but what about the sword
[3:00:52] xmedpakx: full leggos equipped mass histeria
[3:00:57] 2MakeMe: lol sadly thats true
[3:01:15] dracullus: if we get 9.3, 9.2 could be Sepulcher and Anduin as tier boss
[3:01:16] Morpheusx25: Arthas ripcord?
[3:01:20] Lheela: I fully expect arthas in the sylvanas fight
[3:01:21] jontrann: kinda shocked they havent hit the arthas button yet LUL
[3:01:22] fat_european0: @Towelliee Did you read the theory about the Jailer wanted to turn Sargeras' sword into a mourneblade to steal Azeroth's soul?
[3:01:27] fat_european0: wanting*
[3:01:35] Zolshy89: 9.2
[3:01:39] Lheela: like "oh no what have i become"-moment for sylvanas
[3:01:53] johnnyyydh: They will be shooting themself in the foot not using that button
[3:02:01] LtDanAndHisMagicLegs: That would be one giant WOOND to heal
[3:02:02] 2MakeMe: aint what i signed up for lol
[3:02:23] xmedpakx: sylvanas,, "my bad"
[3:02:25] CrunkyBrewster: she'll get her revenge
[3:02:27] Lheela: "The shadowlands ARE FREE" LUL
[3:02:30] fat_european0: I just hope we get to kill her
[3:02:41] segarth: LUL there's a folder somewhere at blizzard named Plan B, with a single page that has written "arthas" on it

[3:03:08] CrunkyBrewster: and she will pick up the sword in Silithis and slay him
[3:03:10] Rudric_Ice: Jailer will reveal his true form after the raid
[3:03:22] jontrann: Jailer aint shit compared to the void lords LUL

[3:03:52] CrunkyBrewster: i think wow kind of needs a big resxet
[3:03:55] Rudric_Ice: @padidinjones  it won't happen
[3:03:58] CrunkyBrewster: now that i think about it

[3:12:09] Artivicii: inb4 shadowpriest tyrande 10.0
[3:12:25] TheUnknowing: all tyrande is interested in is vengeance anyways
[3:12:28] fat_european0: Or blizz will force us to fight her when she doesn't want peace with Sylvanas, portraying Tyrande as the bad guy
[3:12:35] segarth: no way they leave her like that, they've been hyping her up for 2 patches now

[3:15:15] FosterAdamL: hahahahaha
[3:15:26] LtDanAndHisMagicLegs: I don't blame him. After she cut that orcs head off, she'd cut Mal's balls off and use them to gain more power.
[3:15:26] kimmo_gaming: @Towelliee Plot twist, we go back to Azeroth and Malfurion and Azshara are hooking up LOL
[3:15:29] Noshpan: Malfurion just wants to take a nap

[3:17:21] 210Crawler: she runs it!
[3:17:26] BlueBeast33: BFA was a mess, it rushed through like 2 expansions at once
[3:17:44] fat_european0: I think it was part of the deal for the black blade. But we could've just killed her and taken it anyways
[3:17:45] segarth: Not to mention that she put us in that shitshow in the first place LUL
[3:17:51] slizard93: sodaWICKED sodaWICKED same
[3:18:11] kimmo_gaming: @Towelliee Im telling you Azshara is hooking up with Malfurion while Tyrande is in Shadowlands

[3:18:59] BlueBeast33: Knaifu
[3:20:10] Bega1781: hey towelie are you worried about where retail is headed with 9.1
[3:20:54] Arystara: o/
[3:20:54] fat_european0: I'm surprised Preach didn't ask ion about sockets and conduits for 9.1
[3:20:55] slizard93: will they release 9.1 and tbc at same time lol , similar to early december

[3:22:05] PadidinJones: I get them mostly on Classic lol
[3:22:07] fat_european0: I loved TBC so much, but idk. Old raids just aren't as engaging as retail raids FeelsBadMan
[3:22:22] fat_european0: I would've played the shit out of Classic if the raids were as engaging as they are in retail
[3:22:34] artun16: wow there is no one on that server
[3:22:45] dracullus: @Towelliee maybe from time to time we need raid logging expansion, I think people would react really badly for 3rd grind in a row, part of Legion success was that many were hungry for stuff to do after WoD
[3:23:35] Taban: alot of people loved bc, but wrath is gonna be huge. *again* lol
[3:23:46] Dejon09: Do new unlocks on classic and tbc unlock on retail too?
[3:23:50] preheats_lawyer: @dracullus I think there should be content for people who want to play all the time though
[3:23:54] Dejon09: I doubt it huh
[3:24:29] Nehcrom: We all miss the island grind!
[3:24:30] Avinar: i like meaningful grinds that i feel like I'm actually accomplishing something, no matter how much im grinding
[3:24:31] Arystara: BC is when I really got into wow and grinded for my max lvl hunter

[3:27:30] fat_european0: Can't wait to boost up a shadow priest for TBC. I loved it so much
[3:27:39] Shaterhand: Hey, I have won a TBC beta key, but haven't been contacted by anyone yet.
[3:27:49] Lheela: people that say someone is destroying the ecnoomy should just buy the items posted too cheap and sell them for profit
[3:28:13] Shaterhand: Ah okay, didn't know, thanks!

[3:30:27] Magdelia: @segarth all three specs are good
[3:30:33] fat_european0: Yeah I already have a hunter, warlock and warrior at 60 so I might as well get my SP as well tbh
[3:30:41] Magdelia: @segarth as resto you just spam chain heal
[3:30:43] xgtlxnooblet: warlock and hunter are both 1 button dps
[3:30:49] segarth: @Magdelia  cool! gonna play that i think
[3:30:51] Artivicii: 5v5s were nuuuuts
[3:30:53] fat_european0: Yeah I don't get why they removed it. It was stupid fun with friends
[3:30:59] shmurcules: easiest to play is warlock ...
[3:31:00] Avinar: I really enjoy ele shaman for tbc. I'm torn between mage and hunter main myself though. I'm kinda worried druids will be oversaturated that herb farming will just crash though lol
[3:31:04] Artivicii: i did 1700 5v5s in tbc 4Head
[3:31:05] Artivicii: so fun

[3:33:04] 210Crawler: Name top 5 addons you couldnt live without for TBC
[3:33:17] Krusznokh: Krusznokh subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 20 months!

[3:34:30] Moobot: Towelliee has not moved, he is renovating his streaming room over the next month or so. The stream will be scuffed, the audio will be different, but it will be worth it! Soonâ„¢
[3:34:47] Avinar: T&E are next level. They will write a thesis about how they aren't though.
[3:34:47] Artivicii: choreghast?
[3:35:06] Avinar: then go on a rant and pick out everyone that says different
[3:35:07] Artivicii: @Avinar KEKW
[3:35:11] Noshpan: @Towelliee Your video got my D&D group talking about it a few days after you released the video

[3:36:16] WinterSoonBe: Still better than BFA
[3:36:55] WinterSoonBe: That's good. We agree to disagree.
[3:37:00] Skara_XD: I actually enjoyed BFA
[3:37:07] Shaterhand: I think druids have the worst anima powers in torgast, or at least used too, ONLY ROOT shit
[3:37:15] Avinar: too early to judge , for an entire xpac for me. since we haven't had even 9.1   but I disliked BFA besides the zones and story.
[3:37:15] Artivicii: FULL MOON slootB
[3:37:17] PadidinJones: I feel like they changed the amount of anima powers that pop in TG
[3:37:18] Ragura: i enjoy BFA in 8.2 and 8.3 was really fun with essences and corruption
[3:37:20] oSpaced: from this point in Bfa's cycle i had easily double the play time
[3:37:28] Noshpan: I kinda enjoyed BFA, but by the end of the expansion, everything felt rushed.
[3:37:33] segarth: i think Castle Nathria is better than Uldir

[3:38:05] Noshpan: More than once I was saying aloud "My character wouldn't have done this! Nor would they have gone along with this!"
[3:38:15] NormalNomad: what's next after shadowlands you think?
[3:38:20] Avinar: biggest issue right now is that we have gotten content a lot slower than bfa. However, I will say I enjoyd more what I did in in shadowlands more than what I did in bfa and like my classes more. Just... waiting for content too much.
[3:39:33] Skara_XD: I leveled 2 toons and decided to switch to classic
[3:39:51] Avinar: if we had 9.1 like a month or 2 ago, I think I'd be more happy with shadowlands.
[3:39:55] Darzetti_: yea we should have 9.2 ptr
[3:39:59] ScorpioXt: lets hope for good reason
[3:40:31] Zolshy89: is that legit just COVID impact?
[3:40:34] Skara_XD: Im sticking to classic from now on

[3:43:53] Flenzu: yo
[3:44:05] steliyan31: is this ptr or retail? :)
[3:44:08] Bega1781: Do you think  tbc will have a crazy release to the level of classic or will it be a bit more tame?
[3:44:21] Gjala_Brews: I may take heat for this, but at what point does using COVID as an excuse for delays and lack of repayable content become not acceptable? I feel like most of the at home structure issues that all companies had back in 2020 would be ironed out mostly by now.... myabe im just being a dick with this POV tho
[3:44:22] steliyan31: ptr torghast is up, a just watched a preach video on it... He is pissed af xD
[3:44:41] Avinar: dunno, they both got trashed
[3:44:46] cruzeal: still marksmen i think
[3:44:56] ZephirahBlack: @whelp96 I would say try it. See if you like the playstyle. Not all classes are meant for all people.
[3:45:03] steliyan31: Hahahaha xD XD XD
[3:45:42] GFiTV: he says in the video, it's cuz he is irritated and cant understand why blizz would make these choices...
[3:45:53] s3ttee: @Gjala_Brews I don't think being a consumer and being unhappy with failure is "wrong". It is what it is but it doesn't mean we have to like it or be okay with it. They put themselves in this situation with their business model. Which crumbles with lack of content.
[3:46:12] GFiTV: @s3ttee yup
[3:46:30] Xatrixius: that's his problem for going into an interview expecting his own answers or outcome, Preach is nothing but a virtue-signalling egomanical asshole

[3:46:51] Moobot: All giveaways can be found on our Discord under the #Stream channel! discord.gg/towelliee
[3:47:13] Skizzurp: how high up did you go in new torghast floors?
[3:47:14] GFiTV: @Xatrixius Don't have to be so harsh. Ion was right on some parts, but you can't blame preach for having his own interest and fun in mind going into it...
[3:47:57] xmedpakx: sadly too much 1% talk imo,, this game is not revolved around them
[3:48:02] GFiTV: 4 floors + 5th floor is boss
[3:48:10] derElten: 5 floors with the option of two more
[3:48:13] GFiTV: 6th floor and 7nd floor are bonuses for high scores
[3:48:13] Skizzurp: its gonna be 1st 5 floors give u regular soul ash
[3:48:15] hypexsauce_: brockx1977 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 4 months! 
[3:48:17] Zolshy89: just like current torg forget what you did :)
[3:48:20] Xatrixius: @GFiTV doing a bit of your own virtue-signalling right now hmmmm?   sad.
[3:48:22] Skizzurp: after that u get new currency i believe
[3:48:30] ZephirahBlack: So it is beneficial to do the 5th floor then?
[3:48:53] GFiTV: @Xatrixius I really just don't like people attacking people for their opinion. I don't even agree with preach's points on a lot of things lol
[3:49:38] Darzetti_: anyone else just dc from wow
[3:49:48] steliyan31: I think the main reason preach was annoyed is because Ion said there will be no time-limiting aspects of torghast, yet there are abilities that do limit the time (even if that is quite long) xD Otherwise, I agree with you... I love the idea of the future torghast
[3:49:56] dracullus: @Towelliee they already gave him no grind and no titanforging, what the hell Blizz must do to satisfy people like Preach?
[3:50:14] ZephirahBlack: I agree with you @GFiTV - I dont agree with preach on things either but I do like that he provides his point of view.
[3:50:31] GFiTV: @dracullus Actually making a good game cycle?

[3:51:42] GFiTV: Sometimes it just feel like Blizz is making a game for a playerbase they wish they had, not the one they have. but i could obviously be wrong due to echo chamber talk, and me being in my own bubble.
[3:51:54] Thoreya: ^ prob ur own bubble
[3:52:12] ZephirahBlack: I think if you like and have a decent skill set with the character you play then Torghast is ok - not my favorite thing in wow right now but I have done it a few times.
[3:52:14] Thoreya: Everyone plays the game differently. People choose to irngore that
[3:52:15] GFiTV: Probably.
[3:52:17] Thoreya: Ignore*
[3:52:24] hestar: Hey Towelliee, did you play Diablo 3 before? What are your thoughts on it?
[3:52:28] Thoreya: Hence why they say it 1000000 times
[3:52:39] steliyan31: @GFiTV I think that's how it feels to the player base that actually cares... I'm certain they have statistics we will never get our hands on and those statistics are likely what drives game development the way it's going
[3:52:50] fat_european0: I like Sloot's interviews more ngl
[3:53:07] GFiTV: Sure, but you weren't calling preach a Quote from chat "virtue-signalling egomanical asshole" @Towelliee
[3:53:18] dracullus: @Towelliee so far he has 2 wipes
[3:53:22] jontrann: thats good, rather that then a shill doing the interview
[3:54:02] fat_european0: No need to be a shill. Just do interviews like Sloot. Ask a lot of questions to get more info
[3:54:04] jontrann: a shill would agree with everything
[3:54:11] xmedpakx: wtf is a shill
[3:54:25] GFiTV: I love when interviewers challenge developers to a certain point. But you can def go to far.
[3:54:26] Thoreya: A shill mightâ€™ve gotten more instead of talking about covenants for an extended period of time again ðŸ˜‚
[3:54:31] steliyan31: @archaic78 Shill is someone who is promoting something because they like it, and they ignore any downsides to it
[3:54:37] fat_european0: It's ok to give push back occasionally, but no need to drag it out
[3:54:41] Moobot: All giveaways can be found on our Discord under the #Stream channel! discord.gg/towelliee
[3:54:48] dracullus: if you want to see shill interview watch Taliesin with Danuser
[3:54:51] GFiTV: @fat_european0 agreed
[3:54:57] Kromede: 200IQ jontrann
[3:55:00] preheats_lawyer: Yeah sloot does interviews a lot better
[3:55:03] GFiTV: @dracullus LUL
[3:55:03] Lifestream7: @steliyan31  So like a simp for video games?
[3:55:05] preheats_lawyer: I agree with that
[3:55:35] waterdust619: To be fair there is nothing to question about
[3:55:42] fat_european0: He sometimes pushes back usually to give clarification
[3:55:44] segarth: it did seem like preach was fishing for a gotcha moment
[3:55:45] steliyan31: @Lifestream7 Hahahah yeah basically, that's a good way to put iy xD
[3:55:48] fat_european0: but it's not after every question
[3:56:11] GFiTV: If you don't push ion though, u dont get the juicy bits haha
[3:56:29] GFiTV: @segarth this.
[3:56:38] fat_european0: @Towelliee Nah I meant that sloot does it on occasion, which is good and fine

[3:56:43] Thoreya: Man they didnâ€™t even talk about the new raiderio system
[3:56:55] Thoreya: Instead we got tears about covenants for 15 minutes
[3:57:03] GFiTV: @Thoreya cuz no one cares.... not the casuals, not the m+ crowd...
[3:57:15] dwolters_the_zombieman: @Towelliee what do you think about the new Torghast system that they talked about
[3:57:23] Kromede: when is youri nterview?

[3:57:52] fat_european0: When is your cage match with ion? PogChamp
[3:58:03] Yagr6: pvp LUL
[3:58:06] Shaterhand: I think he wanted to see if Ion changed his mind and if a fix for these is in the work, a reason which I agree with, even tho small chances they will admit it.
[3:58:18] Moobot: All giveaways can be found on our Discord under the #Stream channel! discord.gg/towelliee
[3:58:43] GFiTV: @Thoreya Literally copying a system into the game with slight tweeks. Casuals dont care about Raiderio (nor will they about the score), and the hardcore crowd doesnt care if it's in the game or on a website.  Thats what i meant.
[3:59:00] Thoreya: @gfitv and Iâ€™m saying youre wrong
[3:59:08] Thoreya: U donâ€™t speak for literally anyone lol
[3:59:15] GFiTV: @Thoreya i could be. I'm not 100% right all the time haha
[3:59:21] Thoreya: Did anyone care about preach discussing healer dps for 10
[3:59:24] Thoreya: Minutes?
[3:59:32] ZephirahBlack: fucking no - I didnt
[3:59:33] GFiTV: @Thoreya ofcourse not, that is my opinion and from what i see in my bubble /shrug
[3:59:35] naraudin: @GFiTV yea, like lfg system we have now in game
[3:59:49] xmedpakx: no preache had no good questions
[3:59:52] Thoreya: Then stop @ing me lol bc i donâ€™t get ur point
[3:59:58] xmedpakx: sadly i hoped for more
[4:00:20] GFiTV: @Thoreya you legit asked me to clarify... but ill stop pinging

[4:01:42] GFiTV: @Zephirahlynn Haven't seen a positive streamer content in wow since the news about classic and 9.1 came out BESIDES lore lovers like nobbel. ajsPalm
[4:01:56] barkiethebear: im watch mainly to hear about raid stuff mostly
[4:02:03] barkiethebear: i watched"
[4:02:07] Bega1781: It also feels like every time people get that pressing on ion he gets more tight lipped every time
[4:02:10] ZephirahBlack: Yeah and nobble does a great job
[4:02:32] preheats_lawyer: Idk why they keep trying to outsmart Ion. Lawyers don't crack like that.
[4:02:38] GFiTV: agreed, and i forgot, raid in 9.1 looks good. so should add that to the list of positive content ive seen from ppl
[4:02:38] ZephirahBlack: but anywho - im out for the evening / morning
[4:02:51] Moobot: All giveaways can be found on our Discord under the #Stream channel! discord.gg/towelliee
[4:03:17] dwolters_the_zombieman: i think Preach should stop interviewing because he doesn't get the answers he wants i don't know how the new systems are like
[4:03:19] Im_ABagel: how ya hanging in there towelliee?
[4:03:35] fat_european0: @oldmanstoned he didn't just play, he was one of the best players and top theory crafters
[4:03:43] fat_european0: back in vanilla
[4:03:44] barkiethebear: well he did say rework on legendarys so its a possible of the missives
[4:04:15] Bega1781: so far the worst part of SL is everyone quitting, i feel like it wasnt even that bad i just have noone to play with
[4:04:17] Artivicii: rework leggos = make them cost more 4Head
[4:04:22] oraclespyro: are you still sore  from the  hormone thrapy shot @Towelliee ?
[4:04:46] Piebringer619: interview is good ONLY when you looking for fight
[4:05:07] Kromede: yay Tahonta finally dropped
[4:05:12] preheats_lawyer: I think preach's approach to interviews isn't that great tbh. Asking about covenants, aoe cap and that kinda shit with obvious answers makes no sense at all
[4:05:14] preheats_lawyer: get us new info
[4:05:24] Dreadscore: does anyone knows if Ha-Li can spawn this week? im camping for over an hour now

[4:07:05] steliyan31: I gotta say... There is one awesome thing we got from that interview :D Preach's reactions were hilarious at times :D
[4:07:13] fat_european0: It changes to mogu on saturday I think
[4:07:18] dwolters_the_zombieman: every interview Preach does is same thing and he's thinkg that they will change their minds to please him
[4:08:19] dracullus: @Towelliee Ion should pre-record some answers and just push the button

[4:35:05] dwolters_the_zombieman: right now with my pc i have hard time playing WoW got to get ram and maybe ssd to help with it
[4:35:17] PvtHudson093: Bolstering is one of the torments
[4:35:29] Artivicii: KEKW
[4:35:32] McGreeb: I would start by adding some risk to it by kicking you out after a single death, boom end of run
[4:35:35] Mistersalted: beta keys ;)
[4:35:42] McGreeb: like a proper Rogue Lite
[4:35:55] Mevemcs: :)
[4:35:55] Ragura: bolstering in torghast
[4:37:01] PvtHudson093: The reason i did visions because i needed sockets and it rewarded a mount and title and cool cosemetics and gear with corruption, torghast none of that.
[4:37:14] Antb0t: i always thought it was rogue-like, is that not the case
[4:37:51] CrusaderNero: torghast? waste of time spendt
[4:38:06] board4life65: island 2.0?
[4:38:11] Avinar: hades is rogue like and you don't. same with risk of rain 2. great roguelikes
[4:38:12] rohdey: if they do Hvisions 2.0 for new tg and have a vendor/something to make it more than islands then i'm sold
[4:38:12] xmedpakx: wep mogs please
[4:38:16] CrusaderNero: agree
[4:38:31] nerotonkol: visions were fun.
[4:38:35] taxton007: agreed, Visions was so much more fun
[4:38:39] Dirtnose: agree
[4:38:45] itz_blinktv: Torghast has so much potential though, problem is they dont have the fkin creativity to think of decent rewards that wont break the fucking classes
[4:38:45] nerotonkol: but it sucked gathering currency to get in
[4:38:45] rohdey: visions were also challenging but not impossible
[4:38:54] Avinar: there's also no real fun rewards for anything
[4:38:56] Zolshy89: add one 226 a week like visions?
[4:38:58] rohdey: and also gave gear
[4:39:02] pj352: torghast had so much potential they could give permanent talent after completing layer 100 or 200 or smtng

[4:39:17] Goregan: First i was very excited because torghast sounded so good and then i found out its boring as hell, it just takes forever to go through but not because its difficult, no its just boring and takes long and is easy as hell.
[4:39:27] reffan: meh visions after u got the solo title etc were pretty formulaic, they were dealt with the same way each week

[4:39:48] rohdey: you might be able to fail
[4:40:12] PvtHudson093: @reffan but ti was something to work up to and afterward you did it for the high piece of gear and sockets
[4:40:33] 210Crawler: Sounds good
[4:40:46] pj352: sad part is they could put resources elsewhere instead of blowing it on torghast that alot of ppl dislike
[4:40:48] Playwisme: later towillee
[4:40:55] Noshpan: Thanks for the stream
[4:41:07] reffan: @PvtHudson093 true but imo the gameplay wasn't interesting, more annoying with the burning feet and such
