[3:02:34] Esotraz: ele would have more armor cause of the shield if anything no ?
[3:02:35] 인터넷포트: that doesnt sound good

[3:02:54] alireza00700: its not cool what pro player are you plate class like warrior has less mobility to catch that why they have more armor
[3:02:55] Akiowns: i agree
[3:03:00] kotlinktt: Yes cloth more than leather ahaha
[3:03:08] ceookz: @shredder1111 you have less armor cuz the shield that why they nerfed shaman armor

[3:03:20] renberg31: realism in wow
[3:03:20] Metaphors: theres still a hierchy
[3:03:21] M4dmanGG: 30% armor for cloth is like 3-4% less melee dmg taken. It's not that much?
[3:03:23] Metaphors: its just smaller
[3:03:23] ForgingHammer: :p
[3:03:24] Bluguieghe: but why are they doing it?
[3:03:29] Suficationz: armor is just outdated

[3:03:53] SacsTvT: @runnnnnit mes did some calculations, he believes that he will end up at 8kish on his dk. Said "like my hunter"
[3:03:58] bajkaww: 6k armor shaman and 11k warrior rn
[3:04:07] archtme: my warrior goes from 35% reduction to 28,7 after nerf
[3:04:07] runnnnnit: @Whaazz i dont think so, i have 7.7k armor bis
[3:04:08] bombtrippz: @Whaazz  i did the math and wlock will have 26% dmg reduction as cloth and warrior will have 25% dmg reduction
[3:04:09] DaveTheBrave1: but then you should take movement in considiration aswell, or? because its more heavy

[3:05:32] karijes4: ofc it does
[3:05:32] Metaphors: no cuz they have a shield
[3:05:34] Esotraz: if they are wearing a shield im fine with it
[3:05:35] runnnnnit: its fucked
[3:05:35] karijes4: it will happen
[3:05:36] Sillentspecter: as warrior
[3:05:36] Metaphors: thats normal
[3:05:37] thunderxmvp: I think thats not as crazy with a shield class having more armor
[3:05:37] FoxisFitness: ofc it does
[3:05:39] FlashZappa: shamans got extra armor nerf I though
[3:05:42] thunderxmvp: if its mail + shield
[3:05:43] nslime22: that makes no sense
[3:05:46] renberg31: shama armor nerfed
[3:05:46] thunderxmvp: hunter sounds stupid
[3:05:49] Esotraz: shields are alot of armor
[3:05:52] Barradoso: arent sub and ww gonna melt warrs?

[3:05:57] maybethistimepls: only for resto @renberg30
[3:05:58] magnesiium1: doesnt the shield add like 2 or 3k armor?
[3:05:59] Metaphors: mail+shield was always close to plate or a little more
[3:06:00] FoxisFitness: Prot paly will have less with shield too
[3:06:02] runnnnnit: foresighting
[3:06:03] mufaasa_fr: Not only it is weird, but it's unfair as if you connect on them they wont be pubished as much
[3:06:05] pmakewow: shield gives 9999999999999999 armor
[3:06:07] crymorre: time to play prot war Kappa
[3:06:10] unbrokentv1: feral

[3:06:37] thunderxmvp: In combat 5831
[3:06:39] peardraxz: do you think the armor changes willbe enough to stop some classes being victim classes?
[3:06:39] Elo92: they reduced it for rsham but not ele, not sure why. they also reduced boomie, i think they just forgot ele and we'll see them in notes
[3:06:39] Esotraz: around there
[3:06:41] ceookz: @Whaazz that's why their nerfed extra 12.5% on shamans, but feels bad for Enha shamans
[3:06:43] magnesiium1: if its pvp scaled it prob closer to 5.5k-6k
[3:06:45] wardelswijk: its around 5-6k
[3:06:58] bajkaww: they nerf resto armor but forget about ele. Without shield mail 7 armor in pvp
[3:07:01] wardelswijk: armor change wont do shit, but the HP change will imo
[3:07:01] Esotraz: victim classes sounds so troll
[3:07:07] Sillentspecter: 12k armor as mortal warrior pvp geared
[3:07:10] Suficationz: most classes are victim classes coz they have casts
[3:07:15] drdoomkinx: but they only nerfed rsham armor?\
[3:07:16] Deathmarkedx: @Sillentspecter should be a lot more than that
[3:07:19] Vendrek: My Hunter has 5k armor...My warrior has 11k armor. With the new patch warrior will have 7.6kish
[3:07:20] lokum17: My hunter got 7,7k armor in pvp in full gear

[3:07:43] ATHLTE: are they nerfing rsham armor cuz they nerfed hpal armor
[3:07:43] ButtaTWD: isn’t armor only affected by physical damage or am I cooked
[3:07:44] wardelswijk: why
[3:07:49] magnesiium1: dragons get extra armor value baseline from a passive too
[3:07:51] ceookz: eles are tanky
[3:07:51] 0xaxzy: im making a ele bot then
[3:07:52] ATHLTE: and it rsham cant higher armor than hpal

[3:08:12] Drathimos: these armor changes are pretty small tbh
[3:08:14] Esotraz: corky was suffering KEKW @Whaazz
[3:08:14] Deathmarkedx: that nerf is so random
[3:08:18] lmaoerss: why did they nerf boomy? do they forget boomy wears leather not cloth? LUL
[3:08:46] Esotraz: rdruid nerfs are also a indirect nerf to ele shamans no ? @Whaazz
[3:08:47] lmaoerss: no
[3:08:48] Metaphors: into caster
[3:08:49] drdoomkinx: i perma die to meele

[3:08:50] tony1992qt: I was thinking that 2
[3:08:51] Metaphors: boomy is annoying
[3:08:52] wardelswijk: boomkin is squishy this patch
[3:08:54] Deathmarkedx: i swear it feels like blizzard made a mistake on half of those changes
[3:08:59] Deathmarkedx: they nerf resto sham armor instead of ele
[3:09:02] Deathmarkedx: they nerf boomy armor
[3:09:04] drdoomkinx: boomy is top 3 first bloods in solo shuffle
[3:09:06] juanmrbbnero: Did they nerf rdruid?
[3:09:14] Esotraz: chan carried that Kappa
[3:09:20] Akiowns: @drdoomkinx what nr1?
[3:09:21] shredder1111: if anything they should have made clone 5 sec and left armor alone
[3:09:22] runnnnnit: your boomy is like 20th
[3:09:25] blackvpnv: boomkin strugle to survive
[3:09:28] blackvpnv: vs mele
[3:09:29] RealFluffyhype: boomie was fine, bcs as u say.. u have to go bear to be tanky and then u loose damage.
[3:09:29] runnnnnit: thats being modest
[3:09:30] tony1992qt: So bad nerd
[3:09:31] RonWilson: just fake better Kappa
[3:09:32] livetleves: boomy is getting 25% armor nerf in owl form

[3:09:51] wardelswijk: shadowpriest has disperse
[3:09:51] thunderxmvp: I feel like boomy is quite hard to pick up but still easier than all other casters except like ele shaman
[3:09:54] sind233: @walterwhitesp that feral cyclone shit is so disgusting
[3:09:58] wardelswijk: moonkin legit 0 defensive cds
[3:10:00] ButtaTWD: whazz is armory only affected by physical damage
[3:10:06] Esotraz: is that full 489 or some 486 @Vendrek
[3:10:10] Lathrien: they're overtuned damagewise, don't have to cast except clone which is best spammable CC. They should be dead the whole game
[3:10:19] lokum17: My hunter is at 7,7k in pvp with full gear

[3:10:59] michaelss_: I feel like why even change it
[3:11:00] Malte_L: Is rps assa not insane? or are teh sp buffs not that good?
[3:11:02] Metaphors: i think the rshaman armor change
[3:11:03] Metaphors: is bad
[3:11:04] stepkoudny: I would love if warriors took damage
[3:11:05] nokkiusklol: but how much is it in % reduction?
[3:11:05] michaelss_: don’t think it was a problem for anyone
[3:11:07] magnesiium1: evokers have like 70% more armor baseline but no nerfs there
[3:11:09] roupsinto: Warlock before the buff has about 5.5k?
[3:11:09] RonWilson: don't forget warriors lose strength as well cause 20% of their armor = strength
[3:11:16] ceookz: maybe they want to check on rshaman first
[3:11:20] Esotraz: rdruid nerfs is a indrect nerf to ele no ? @Whaazz isnt it the most common healer for eles
[3:11:27] lokum17: Bro if u are playing MM u are getting trained almost evry game
[3:11:29] Jrexlol: and still no nerf DHs tglKEKW @Whaazz
[3:11:29] J0n_B: just seems like a lazy pvp change. Oh lets buff cloth armor and nerf plate armor - sounds good Jeff

[3:11:55] Deathmarkedx: 12.5
[3:11:56] archtme: 12.5 yea
[3:11:56] wardelswijk: after ``closely monitoring the ladder`` they cooked up a 5% nerf for resto druid. its insane
[3:11:59] Metaphors: shaman is notorious for being trained
[3:12:03] Metaphors: doesnt make sense
[3:12:07] Lamatastisch: tbh I think rshamy is way less tanky than ele. rshamy just dies to cleaves imo
[3:12:08] Vendrek: Though cloth buff for physical damage was long overdue, just not for Warlocks who were already really tanky from the class armor spells and their defensives.
[3:12:11] Esotraz: Adge
[3:12:14] p0limashine: do u think spriest would be good after update?

[3:12:33] cruelzam: haha, prob true
[3:12:36] williaaamp: nerf lottery
[3:12:37] lmaoerss: They dont play their own game, thats the problem
[3:12:42] Mfgergo: :D

[3:12:44] wardelswijk: 12.5 points for Griffondor
[3:12:49] p0limashine: do u think spriest would be good after update?
[3:12:50] tempestyn: the algorithm overlord said 12.5 so its 12.5

[3:13:19] gaetanpog: its only physical tho most cleaves are magical except like ret war
[3:13:21] blackvpnv: i was expecting a nerf dh dk ww
[3:13:27] reazer125: would hpally have more armor than resto sham with the nerfs?
[3:13:30] p0limashine: do u think spriest would be good after update?

[3:13:41] vengiitv: no one mentioning ret
[3:13:46] Skyle_win: as plate will take more dam from rogue too
[3:13:51] Lamatastisch: @Whaazz my PvE geared dev evoker hast 13.2k armor, 485gs and no pvp gear. Doesnt that mean a evoker has way more armor than an arms warrior?
[3:13:53] lokum17: @runnnnnit yea idk bro, i think its feels so bad this ssn, im struggeling so hard :/
[3:13:54] belvedee: the tried-and-true phrase "train blue" is back on the menu

[3:14:19] walterwhitesp: mage even more immortal than normal
[3:14:19] n0tDef1ned: what is big change for mage
[3:14:20] Drathimos: the point of armor changes isnt to buff or nerf, its to normalize phys dps polarizing match ups. they will retune phys dps afterwards if they have to.
[3:14:21] Metaphors: so insane
[3:14:21] sneakyloo: h priest got big buffs also
[3:14:21] nslime22: lock is gonna be hard to kill
[3:14:22] nokkiusklol: more stamina = nerf rmp no?
[3:14:24] blackvpnv: mage warlock rdrood

[3:14:41] smuuchx: mage is easily tunneled but man warlocks are going to be even more unkillable
[3:14:43] drdoomkinx: do you think they need to look at priest passive 20% dmg reduction now since they buffed armor?
[3:14:45] wardelswijk: mage takes 2% less dmg next wednesday is it really that gamebreaking?
[3:14:54] magnesiium1: KEKW

[5:41:22] emergence_fi: feint + evasion is kinda like wall
[5:41:31] Akrololz: when u eva u don't take dmg anyway
[5:41:40] Drjayfisto: youre probably holding evasion a lot but you can force perma cdr on it and you have 80% evasion up in pvp even i think xd
[5:41:41] iiEnvy: isnt it only 10% in pvp tho
[5:41:52] steebet: xd
[5:42:06] eX1stnZ_: vs double caster tho eva would be a defensive for 20% dam reduc

[5:53:41] walterwhitesp: @Delxenyo apparitions is about 10% of your  dmg in that build and it's being buffed by 20% so it's not a major buff
[5:54:02] walterwhitesp: the apparitions change is more for next season's tier set bonus imo
[5:54:23] Delxenyo: Ah rip then havent rly looked into it
[5:54:55] walterwhitesp: i think its like a 5% dmg buff overall probably with some survival buffs, might still be good
[5:55:19] Deathmarkedx: @walterwhitesp almost nobody ran 4p last season tho
[5:55:21] Malte_L: destruction
