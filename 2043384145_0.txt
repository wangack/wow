[0:08:47] iambloob7: Dommy sounds like you need a break to reset
[0:08:50] kizelet: 6400 subs illusions you to play wow but excluding gifted subs, your real subs are down to around 2300
[0:08:52] rnd_username: you finally noticed?
[0:08:55] Isyyde: its bad. Evening is prime time

[0:09:43] niotic1312: psichiatrist puts you in the loony bean
[0:09:46] vacerss: Is enemy premade?

[0:10:04] Pizzadoxx19: whaa whaa people give me money while a play video games, why would you need a psichiatrist?
[0:10:15] rnd_username: time to go to a shrink
[0:10:16] CircleSocialClub: one is meds one is talk
[0:10:19] a_fat_monkey: It's so over

[0:10:39] Thewanderingplayer: ewWow
[0:10:44] defensiveMAN: tomorrow it‚Äôs gonna be eu4 stream and then tommy will get bored and then say‚Äù I wanna shit on you guys and play wow‚Äùand then it will be full wow stream
[0:10:58] mironp: @JohnTheTurtleMa to be fair you kinda did KEKW
[0:11:02] rnd_username: one talks to you while the other puts you on sedatives @tommykaylive
[0:11:05] CircleSocialClub: Tommy you litteraly made the boards so you can justify playing wow
[0:11:07] crazykman290: theyre both the same thing, one of them can prescribe medication(psychiatrist), the other can not. (atleast in the us)
[0:11:18] rnd_username: @johntheturtlema thanks for the sub
[0:11:27] a_fat_monkey: Tommy is streamingüòÄ It's a wow streamüòî

[0:12:30] mironp: You are problem Tommy!!! You ask them to vote for WOW and you PUT WOW UP FOR VOTE OMEGALUL
[0:12:31] Thewanderingplayer: "In 2024 we will grab twitch by the balls. No shit content anymore" (Tommy, december 2023.)
[0:12:35] ramz9900: What is the point of the change, do you plan to live a "better" life or longer?
[0:12:37] defensiveMAN: maybe try and slowly phase out wow from stream
[0:12:47] ramz9900: you got it bruv, don't worry, you just do you lol
[0:12:48] spyeter: @Thewanderingplayer "i wanna shit on you with WOW"
[0:12:52] CircleSocialClub: do you actually want to fix it?
[0:12:57] AIM_the_Bulldozer: @TommyKayLIVE Earlier you said you were having lots of fun with Zomboid, why don't you play that instead of wow
[0:13:00] VastisMonke: @shuggyx any hoi4 today?
[0:13:01] Pizzadoxx19: a stremer with that many subscribers shouldnt be at 250 viewers
[0:13:03] Vegasmcswagger: addicted to what?
[0:13:04] vacerss: btw is there eu4 sunday or we can do same time raid? @TommyKayLIVE

[0:13:15] sisyphus0: how often are you playing ufc tommy
[0:13:16] AIM_the_Bulldozer: @Vegasmcswagger you are looking at it
[0:13:18] kizelet: opening stream with wow then switching to main content also decreases your viewers on main content @TommyKayLIVE
[0:13:21] nomountain2tall: This man is going to a psychiatrist because of WoW
[0:13:27] Thewanderingplayer: @defensiveMAN I know.
[0:13:28] black_hawk1907: bl4ckh4wk1907 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 17 months! Oh heck nah. First time in two weeks that Im able to watch the Stream due to uni and Tommy is playing WoW...Still love ya Tommy tommykLOVE

[0:13:31] astiwana: Chat needs to do an intervention
[0:13:31] mironp: Delete your wow account and cancel subsribtion tommy what are you talking about?? KEKW
[0:13:37] CircleSocialClub: you could start to fix it right now, but quitting wow
[0:13:45] rnd_username: you say this type of grand plans for change and improvement every few streams and never go through with them. start small and try to be consistent with it. @tommykaylive
[0:13:47] Xi4V: lol

[0:14:07] kizelet: @JohnTheTurtleMa hey john, did you hear about boris nadezhdin? been following the guy in last days
[0:14:09] truthteller00: @TommyKayLIVE just give Lisa your stream keys so she can shut it down when you are in addiction phase and below certain viewcount
[0:14:26] mironp: really?? you will lose 4 times in a row and hate it, like in morning..
[0:14:27] arjunbossman: work isn‚Äôt fun get back to work
[0:14:28] imag1ne_smh: Goal to be the best streamer of all time: Have more than 500 viewers on WoW
[0:14:31] CircleSocialClub: you are literally taking the drung (wow) while talking about quitting. one of many signs of addiction
[0:14:43] spyeter: "Lets try tommorow" -> "Lets try tommorow" -> "Lets try-"
[0:14:46] JohnTheTurtleMa: @kizelet yes i put a signature for him
[0:14:49] Bence9811: why is there no rp game? not enough players?
[0:14:55] kizelet: @JohnTheTurtleMa +1000 respect
[0:14:57] Thewanderingplayer: Tommy is also a reactionary person in general. The more we want something, the less he wants do it.
[0:14:58] Foxx_1111: and that is the problem, it is fun but adictiv and bad for stream
[0:15:04] AIM_the_Bulldozer: I really want to trust with the tomorrow stuff, but I just can't
[0:15:11] CircleSocialClub: many excuses, little change
[0:15:16] spyeter: @AIM_the_Bulldozer  "Lets try tommorow" -> "Lets try tommorow" -> "Lets try to-"
[0:15:18] JohnTheTurtleMa: Do your own rp game
[0:15:19] mironp: we are trying to help you
[0:15:23] mironp: stop playing
[0:15:24] imag1ne_smh: "New year new stream-"
[0:15:26] mironp: delete account
[0:15:27] CircleSocialClub: go see a professional and uninstall wow
[0:15:29] mironp: KEKW
[0:15:29] crazykman290: you wouldnt try to "fix" your own broken ankle, you would go to the doctor. ADHD/ADD, psychological issues are the same, go to the doctor.
[0:15:36] shuggyx: Well have fun Tommy and see you tomorrow
[0:15:43] Foxx_1111: here is fix: stop Wow right now, not tomorrow
[0:15:43] AIM_the_Bulldozer: @TommyKayLIVE warm up with zomboid
[0:15:44] defensiveMAN: the wow cycle is basically Tommy restarts wow-he gets addicted again-something happens that makes him delete it-repeat after 6 months
[0:15:47] SebSea: Magic warmum Kappa
[0:15:49] spyeter: you'll just play wow tommorow too
[0:15:52] SebSea: *wamup
[0:15:53] Cadurana: Starcraft warmup
[0:15:57] AIM_the_Bulldozer: @TommyKayLIVE ZOMBOID warm up
[0:16:16] CircleSocialClub: you obviously know what to do about it  you are an intelligent person, but you dont want to do it cause it hard and it hurts
[0:16:19] mironp: we should set up some punishment for you at least KEKW  you shit on us with WoW so you pay for it
[0:16:26] rnd_username: we have been listening to you making plans for change for a few years now. I think that by this point you have proven to yourself that you can‚Äôt fix it by yourself @tommykaylive
[0:16:34] iambloob7: @TommyKayLIVE I've learned writing things down helps you commit.
[0:16:37] spyeter: "Lets try tommorow" -> "Lets try tommorow" -> "Lets try-"
[0:16:39] RoyalOak095: the master plan
[0:16:42] SebSea: twitch chat best therapist
[0:16:46] Werxteam98: Plan for tommorow: FIFA ALL DAY
[0:16:49] blackhawk9704: you build this stream on being yourself and that is the reason why you so succesfull. Poeple are not here for the content their are here because of you
[0:16:57] ramz9900: Good, be adaptable, don't follow a main plan, ez win
[0:17:05] kizelet: the problem is, when wow is in your head, you're distracted from main content
[0:17:11] Isyyde: Just hit "Logout" and Start italy
[0:17:16] rnd_username: new content idea: livestream therapy sessions @tommykaylive
[0:17:20] Bence9811: hopefully fifa all day
[0:17:21] mironp: you are looking for excuse! you want to stop - stop, now. Delete this shit, delete account KEKW   you are not looking for help you are looking for a way to keep playing
[0:17:24] ackerman21_: What's the problem?
[0:17:24] imag1ne_smh: You can blame your WoW addiction on subs for voting on WoW
[0:17:27] Vegasmcswagger: @TommyKayLIVE you will only change when you realize it's serious, John isnt helping
[0:17:38] kol_grim: sup Tommy
[0:17:41] Vegasmcswagger: if john stops you're fucked
[0:17:45] iambloob7: Chat this is all Johns fault remember

[0:19:04] FrostBitey10: you'd ban us KEKW
[0:19:04] truthteller00: @TommyKayLIVE just give Lisa your stream keys so she can shut it down when you are in addiction phase and below certain viewcount
[0:19:07] Vegasmcswagger: we do that and you ban us
[0:19:07] AIM_the_Bulldozer: I have done it since the beggining
[0:19:09] arjunbossman: that‚Äôs what we are don‚Äôt right now lol
[0:19:11] Foxx_1111: tommy you weak pussy, you suck
[0:19:16] shuggyx: you wont listen anyways and just give out bans
[0:19:16] lobotomite221: I always spam you and I get a ban in return
[0:19:16] Thewanderingplayer: Chat scared cause you ban people
[0:19:21] rnd_username: what Tommy does regarding self improvement @mironp
[0:19:21] Bence9811: even if we do that you turn us off with "fu chat I'm the streamer, I do whatever I want, ok?"
[0:19:23] kizelet: we seen this phase so much, but when wow is in your head plans doesn't work
[0:19:31] lobotomite221: I always spam you and I get a ban in return dommy
[0:19:42] mironp: @rnd_username nothing? KEKW

[0:19:56] rnd_username: @tommykaylive we try when you play StarCraft but you don‚Äôt listen
[0:19:58] Thewanderingplayer: If we spam, you either get insulted or banned.
[0:20:02] niotic1312: into 7h hoi4?
[0:20:07] VastisMonke: what timezome
[0:20:13] iteryn: does John's sub equate the same as someone buying a sub from Western EU / NA?
[0:20:15] ramz9900: I need to learn EU4, I will be there
[0:20:16] truthteller00: @TommyKayLIVE don't rely on chat to be your supervisor, you need someone IRL like LIsa who can snap you our from addiction phase.
[0:20:16] JohnTheTurtleMa: Do your own rp game. Mabe not somthing big but small like that LOTR mod game or other small mods
[0:20:24] SneekiCheekiBreeki: into 12h fifa
[0:20:28] niotic1312: 7h hoi 4 kaiser is kinda hard
[0:20:32] shuggyx: into 12hr Wow
[0:20:46] ramz9900: It is not addiction, is it lack of drive, lack of care to really change
[0:20:52] ackerman21_: DId you stop playing starcraft?
[0:20:53] kadjensambou: I am not addicted i just can't stop
[0:20:54] ackerman21_: havent seen it in a while
[0:20:56] Foxx_1111: people can like their addiction
[0:21:01] mironp: I will translate this for you chat that means 2 hours of wow in morning, 1 hour EU 4, getting angry taking break and then coming back tired and playing WOW rest of the evening.....
[0:21:02] shuggyx: WoW is not really competative
[0:21:07] Foxx_1111: it isnt mutially exclusive
[0:21:07] FrostBitey10: do the hoi4 1on1s then @TommyKayLIVE \
[0:21:07] kizelet: never open your streams with wow, it harms the accumulation of viewers for main content @TommyKayLIVE
[0:21:15] ackerman21_: Did you stop Starcraft?
[0:21:20] FrostBitey10: the hoi4 1on1s would be perfect for that
[0:21:25] shuggyx: Get starcraft back on
[0:21:35] mironp: tommykLUL
[0:21:47] rnd_username: good luck with the plan @tommykaylive

[0:22:12] niotic1312: you have 3 hours out of 10
[0:22:15] AIM_the_Bulldozer: @TommyKayLIVE Just think about every game you play as competitive. Like in Hoi4 singleplayer think: "I will unify italy faster than a certain date"
[0:22:19] kizelet: bannerlord returns?
[0:22:21] SneekiCheekiBreeki: into 24hr fifa
[0:22:25] Bence9811: @Vegasmcswagger still, who the fuck are you again?

[1:11:39] mironp: Ok but advantage for what? For raids?

[1:13:04] flcn: so how do these "seasons" your talking about work? if you dont mind.

[1:21:15] Domebuddy: Shadow without shadowform is giga trash
[1:21:31] Kruber_twitch: Shadowform isn't gonna help it
[1:21:35] Kruber_twitch: Needs good runes
[1:21:54] flcn: so respec still costs a boatload of gold?

[1:23:53] AIM_the_Bulldozer: My dad has a bunch of old discs of some ancient videogames
[1:23:59] Reidy86: Same, had a shit load of disks. normally watching this would make me play but im playing retail
[1:24:13] CelticHugs: I have the OG Lord of the Rings Online box/cds
[1:24:17] Domebuddy: SoD is all about pub stomping
[1:24:27] Funki83: evrybody got that box with gold games boxes ans good old 90¬¥s porn vhs
[1:24:35] Starkly112: in LoL you can't KEKW the mode people care about is only solo/duo @TommyKayLIVE
[1:24:42] kortox_z: i dont know anything about wow but its look like fun chill game
[1:24:56] Domebuddy: There is very little skill expression without arena or rating based battlegrounds
[1:24:57] capitano49: what would your dream job be if you could not stream @tommykaylive
[1:24:57] Kruber_twitch: Hunter with melee weave is skill based x)
[1:25:02] Kruber_twitch: So sweaty
[1:25:10] lurthemir: I wonder if they'll add arenas in SoD
[1:25:21] kortox_z: bratwust mann
[1:25:22] flcn: barmaid
[1:25:22] mironp: So WOW came out 2004, I was playing Rome total war and GTA San Andreas LUL
[1:25:24] elmertusk18: do you think they should add arenas in SoD?
[1:25:27] Domebuddy: They said they were changing something with battlegrounds i think, so hopefully no more pub stomping
[1:25:44] innerrinner: trying to become a big cook nowdays is impossible
[1:26:16] Domebuddy: https://twitter.com/NoraValletta/status/1749091928858366037
[1:26:17] AIM_the_Bulldozer: I bet I could work at a Michelin star restaurant in charge of deserts
[1:26:20] elmertusk18: but maybe when cap is 60 and everybody has the runes they want it may be balanced but idk
[1:26:29] kortox_z: Make a d√∂ner station in germany
[1:26:31] Lars_Keizer: People will always eat, there is always place for cooks
[1:26:31] pepefrog_nl: @TommyKayLIVE cooking is very hard physically and especially mentally
[1:26:52] kortox_z: but you cook in hoi4 all time
[1:26:52] innerrinner: to be frank im goning off of what people told me so xD
[1:27:03] malinous147: how did this happen again iehziehzeingieng
[1:27:13] Domebuddy: Most line cooks never get to do anything creative ever lol
[1:27:42] innerrinner: Well I can make a pretty dope protein shake so...
[1:27:42] mironp: There is great restaurant fallow they have YouTube channel and they put GoPro videos from them cooking food during service... It is crazy
[1:28:01] Domebuddy: its just hard work
[1:28:08] Kruber_twitch: "professionals"

[1:28:31] Domebuddy: true
[1:28:36] capitano49: why are you not speaking to your team @tommykaylive
[1:28:45] Domebuddy: Failure is a choice
[1:28:52] Lars_Keizer: Michelin Star Doner kebab EZ
[1:28:57] innerrinner: could you turn up your volume if possible, cant hear you over the people talking @TommyKayLIVE
[1:29:04] pepefrog_nl: it is very likely you will be able to be creative in the menu at your job @TommyKayLIVE
[1:29:36] Lars_Keizer: Oh there's actually a Michelin Star kebab place in Manchester KEKW
[1:30:03] Domebuddy: Priests are so fucking broken in SoD moon2SPIN
[1:30:10] pepefrog_nl: yeah it depends on the chef
[1:30:40] kortox_z: in where?
[1:30:53] malinous147: what a lovely life
[1:30:59] mironp: I love when I can sit close to kitchen and if it's not busy even talk with them bit
[1:31:32] malinous147: do u like fish? what is your favorite fish if so (to eat)
[1:31:38] innerrinner: I have this pizzeria close to where I live that makes pizza that putclasses every other pizza place in a 100km radius
[1:31:57] Domebuddy: outclasses he means LUL
[1:31:59] Domebuddy: typo
[1:31:59] innerrinner: outclasses*
[1:32:07] NeuGemi: favorite cuisine?
[1:32:18] Domebuddy: im glad i enjoy cheap garbage
[1:32:19] FrostBitey10: you like fucking food? Kappa
[1:32:25] Domebuddy: FeelsGoodMan
[1:32:40] mironp: I feel so sad for people who have food just as fuel... What's the point of life LUL LUL
[1:32:41] Domebuddy: SoD is dead, waiting for next phase.
[1:33:14] mironp: Oh that's shit
[1:33:14] Domebuddy: @mironp I use my money on things that dont get shit out later
[1:33:21] AIM_the_Bulldozer: Its like a tourist trap
[1:33:22] chantalzunbriel: And probably way to expensive
[1:33:25] kortox_z: in turkey there is a chance of getting bird meat instead cow meat in your d√∂ner
[1:33:34] truder_0: cotoletta milanese
[1:33:43] innerrinner: Did you hear the story of when dominos tried to open a pizzeria in italy?
[1:33:48] atsusaki: Like as a trick? You can get chicken doner
[1:33:58] AIM_the_Bulldozer: KEKW
[1:34:00] mironp: @domebuddy ok but do you not go on a vacation because you leave and go home later???
[1:34:09] Domebuddy: Put that on a resume and get a job as a "food critic" Kappa
[1:34:22] AIM_the_Bulldozer: You should go and review my old schools food
[1:34:23] kortox_z: So you are a gourmet
[1:34:26] 1DVictory: can you link one of your review
[1:34:30] flcn: tommykayrestaurantguide yt arc incoming
[1:34:46] innerrinner: you one of those food critics from south park?
[1:34:57] Domebuddy: @mironp I spend my vacation time at home :D
[1:35:21] 1DVictory: SHOW THEM
[1:35:27] kortox_z: in turkey there is a chance of getting bird meat instead cow meat in your d√∂ner and they sill got 4 stars sometimes
[1:35:35] Domebuddy: Triangulate your food reviews LUL
[1:35:49] sirisaac42: I can recommend the German podcast "R√∂ststoff" which is all about fine dining. Every week, star chefs or sommeliers talk about their jobs and experiences
[1:36:51] kortox_z: ƒ± go to germany every summer and there is bratwust turck near aldi they make soo good sousuges with curry souces
[1:36:54] mironp: Yeah...
[1:36:57] AIM_the_Bulldozer: The worst italian food I have had was in New York, It was a family restaurant but everything had been frozen and reheated
[1:37:15] Domebuddy: you just going to dungeon grind?
[1:37:21] innerrinner: ive had shitty raw meat before
[1:37:41] Domebuddy: Most of the bad food on kitchen nightmares is just because its frozen
[1:37:46] niotic1312: new season in 2024
[1:37:49] kortox_z: america have  no food culture
[1:38:00] mironp: I think lot of them are also very very tired.. If it's just stress and shit for 10 years you give up
[1:38:03] AIM_the_Bulldozer: THe worst restaurants I have ever been in were in the USA
[1:38:15] innerrinner: i feel like if i ate an american dish id die from diabetes
[1:38:20] some_random_icelander: used to love trying out diffrent way to cook but after starting to work at nights. now i just throw vegitables and chiken/thin beef on a pand woth asian sauces (teriaky,hoisin,sweet and sour etc) LUL
[1:38:56] flcn: i guess you can become overwhelmed by the logistics side especially if you have to many items on the menu which is always a bad sign if i see to many dishes on a menu
[1:38:58] kortox_z: my moms dinner better
[1:38:59] PabloTescobar26: I think the only canned things that good restaurants use are tomatoes
[1:39:05] durazn_ito: Love you tommy
[1:39:16] Domebuddy: America is far too big to just generalize anything @innerrinner
[1:39:19] AIM_the_Bulldozer: "I want to do more cooking streams" but wow exists
[1:39:30] listrong7: You should watch The Menu (2022), it's a movie about pretentiousness of fine dining and critic of "food enthusiasts"
[1:39:42] atsusaki: Chinese restaurants too
[1:39:45] innerrinner: @Domebuddy I know im wrong my brain just telling me not to do it. unless its mexican
[1:39:48] mironp: How do you feel about sushi Tommy??? To me it is really boring, no good texture and not much flavor....
[1:39:49] flcn: asian most dishes are the same except for the sauce
[1:39:50] NeuGemi: only two things on the menu, isnt' that too small?
[1:39:52] Vegasmcswagger: and you say italian cuisine is better
[1:39:57] atsusaki: If your menu isn't a small novel at a Chinese restaurant it's not good
[1:40:00] Vegasmcswagger: greek cuisine masterrace
[1:40:11] kortox_z: when ƒ± go to germany i dont see to much german waitress all of them kurdish
[1:40:27] PabloTescobar26: Chat and Tommy what wow class should I go?
[1:40:33] mironp: Gyro >>>>>>>> kebab
[1:40:33] flcn: sounds strange ^^
[1:40:33] Antiokh_: @TommyKayLIVE but greek food is too much heavy
[1:40:49] kortox_z: @mironp Kebap better
[1:40:56] atsusaki: Just don't have as much tzaziki
[1:41:04] Domebuddy: Huge wow streamer
[1:41:07] AIM_the_Bulldozer: @Domebuddy I have been to the US multiple times and everything is so much unhealthier. Additionally the amount of food in a dish is legit obscene
[1:41:11] some_random_icelander: best fast food is those little borito or burger places that only have 3 things on the menue but still manage to stay alive fore years LUL
[1:41:19] Vegasmcswagger: imagine how often he plays offstream for them to ask if he's live
[1:41:29] PhasedKitten: Glizzy
[1:41:53] PhasedKitten: appetizers
[1:41:53] mironp: Starters
[1:41:55] AIM_the_Bulldozer: Starters @TommyKayLIVE
[1:41:57] PhasedKitten: or starters
[1:42:05] Antiokh_: @TommyKayLIVE Thank for advice
[1:42:11] mironp: I love keftades
[1:42:17] kortox_z: greeks add their food ki example our dessert name is baklava they name it baklavaki  we have cacƒ±k and they name in cacƒ±ki
[1:42:18] Domebuddy: @AIM_the_Bulldozer food in the US is so varied and from so many different cultures, that its almost impossible to pin down any characteristic on any of it. Ill agree portions are bigger though.
[1:42:20] atsusaki: Those Greek grape leaf rolls are so good
[1:42:32] eazzyd: In town next to mine there is a pizza place that serves authentic neapolitalian pizza in Poland. They are ranked in top 100 best pizza venues in the world so there is a great chance that you would go to Italy and get worse pizza. Once I went there and half of menu was missing because part of the staff went for competition which they won. I love this place
[1:42:34] PhasedKitten: @atsusaki Kreygasm they are
[1:42:36] PabloTescobar26: Tbf most other wow streamers have no personality LUL
[1:43:08] Domebuddy: Only wow streamers i really check in on are Payo and Savix
[1:43:15] PhasedKitten: @eazzyd as a portlandian, can confirm, but we also have good food as a minimum, its hard to tell
[1:43:15] kortox_z: they dont know tommy?!?!??
[1:43:17] Domebuddy: maybe sometimes guzu
[1:43:18] Antiokh_: @TommyKayLIVE what r plans for tonight wow?
[1:44:01] kortox_z: Your game is still on project zomboid u can change it to wow
[1:44:12] malinous147: 27 subs for a monster :o
[1:44:17] kortox_z: Tommy can ƒ± make turkish raid to rp Pliss
[1:44:35] PhasedKitten: why make it turkish
[1:44:35] malinous147: i prefer red bull over monster
[1:44:52] PhasedKitten: does the turkish have rights over azeroth?
[1:44:57] stormyprawn: @PhasedKitten it can't be a turkish raid without it being turkish. hope that helps
[1:45:07] kortox_z: @malinous147 monster have to much sugar on it
[1:45:11] mironp: @tommykaylive so what is a great German dish you would recommend??? First thing I imagine from Germany is currywurst and that's not great ...
[1:45:33] kortox_z: @stormyprawn ƒ± am turkish ƒ± was going to join with my friends
[1:46:04] mironp: I'm Czech so we are close to your cuisine
[1:46:08] stormyprawn: @kortox_z oh i thought you were memeing or something lol
[1:46:08] kortox_z: bratwust
[1:46:17] Domebuddy: went to a german place in the chicago area, the schnitzel was great :)
[1:46:17] SebSea: The best UK food is mostly international
[1:46:23] AIM_the_Bulldozer: The northern half of europe is not the biggest general food culture
[1:46:30] PhasedKitten: @PhasedKitten thank god that SCP will never escape and become sentient to communicate with the greater Turkish hivemind. LETSFUCKINGGO
[1:46:40] mironp: Yeah I love Austrian stuff I go to Alps often
[1:46:58] mironp: Grostl or spatzle
[1:46:58] Antiokh_: @TommyKayLIVE German desserts are good though
[1:46:59] malinous147: my favorite food is  shrimp croquettes with fries :))
[1:47:03] some_random_icelander: best german food culture is kebab.(best kebab ive ever had was in hamburg)
[1:47:04] atsusaki: Vienna is one of the most beautiful cities in the world imo
[1:47:08] Gammeldamm: we have labskaus and gr√ºnkohl  in the north. its ok
[1:47:12] kortox_z: tommy u can make rp with clans and u can make clan fights look like walking dead
[1:47:15] pcduckkkkk: so they are not diverse
[1:47:22] PhasedKitten: @kortox_z DIESOFCRINGE
[1:47:25] MaxWeeman: You mean szwiterland?

[1:48:41] PhasedKitten: KKona  ahh only EU things. ofc U gotta make sure your not explicitly hating on a group because you mentioned them by name
[1:48:50] mironp: It's so funny you are walking in this small village in Alps and a local woman in hidjab walks next to you and it's bizarre
[1:48:52] AIM_the_Bulldozer: @TommyKayLIVE Have you ever tried kebab pizza
[1:49:13] plpolakpol: Looks like Kotor, Montenegro
[1:49:22] Domebuddy: Go fishin :)
[1:49:23] Razihel_Ita: Its very looking like Lake Garda in Italy, love that
[1:49:33] kortox_z: Can you put me in your suitcase?
[1:49:52] daciderearl: @Domebuddy hahahaha u got no idea how difficult/expensive it is to fish in austria
[1:49:53] Domebuddy: Golf
[1:49:55] PhasedKitten: KEKW what a emotional experience
[1:49:56] PhasedKitten: Gold

[1:50:24] Domebuddy: @daciderearl You right i don't lol, in America its easy.
[1:50:31] PabloTescobar26: Yeah it's escapism
[1:50:33] pcduckkkkk: maybe they are not friends enouigh to talk about other stuff?
[1:50:39] incbo: is wow pvp just running around doing nothing over and over again?
[1:50:42] PLXR_TAZE: Tommy Kay what happened to HOI4?
[1:50:44] mironp: I think if I should live in Germany around Chiemsee is really nice
[1:50:45] plpolakpol: KEKW
[1:50:45] atsusaki: Ehh I think when you're around for that long you want to see things that you haven't seen. Fair enough imo
[1:50:50] PhasedKitten: must be a german thing, much older generations are the ones trabeling with a smile still
[1:51:00] daciderearl: @Domebuddy i wish it was that easy to go fishing here
[1:51:07] PhasedKitten: NA
[1:51:17] mironp: If you can share it with someone, it makes it 1000x better.
[1:51:38] smokeweedz: thats the best vacation man @TommyKayLIVE
[1:51:43] PhasedKitten: @Domebuddy u wanna go? lets hop down to the nearest 200 fishing spots in a national park
[1:51:44] mironp: I think those people want to turn off their brain, so I can understand also I guess
[1:51:54] pcduckkkkk: maybe they just want to relax but not explore?
[1:51:54] plpolakpol: Maybe theyre too tired

[2:19:43] PhasedKitten: halo listening? no thats spiderman
[2:20:55] PhasedKitten: what a time to be old enough to live in
[2:21:11] 90Veks: anyone remembers Clinkz the warlock from Nihillum clan, damn he pwned
[2:21:15] PhasedKitten: I was playing spiderman 2 on ps2 prolly udring that
[2:21:33] mironp: Ok but in theory "anyone" with the same gear would get same numbers, right?? The number itself takes no skill, just getting the gear??
[2:22:05] kozbringerl: if u invest so much time u dont have time left
[2:22:56] PhasedKitten: sunk cost fallacy Kappa
[2:23:22] hansdevil: @mironp not completely. you also need to follow rotation and to be at the top you need to be able to go trhough rotation while moving as the boss reuqires as well as adapting to changes in the fight due to rng and get the best of the available cds (might have to switch up rotation)
[2:23:37] Peri_Okeanu: @mironp Takes a skill to make a yt montage in 2011
[2:23:51] PhasedKitten: smart, always winning always adapting alpha male
[2:23:58] djorn127: would be epic is Tommy made  a WoW montage for YT
[2:24:04] djorn127: if*
[2:24:29] KarolJanNowak: @hansdevil also gear is also subject to power creep, what was impressive then is now not as impressive
[2:25:17] hansdevil: yes. numbers need to get bigger. just like everywhere in life :D
[2:25:29] PhasedKitten: social blade
[2:25:32] PhasedKitten: right?
[2:25:35] FrostBitey10: you are still the content though. you can take credit too
[2:25:46] mironp: I guess so... I feel like for example top level Starcraft player the skill is so much easier to see than WOW but probably if you play it you see it
[2:25:47] hansdevil: tommy monthly earnings 454‚Ç¨. seems right
[2:26:26] PhasedKitten: Pog winning EZ
[2:26:31] TntMooze: net worth isnt income lol
[2:26:32] mironp: well that includes your apartment right
[2:26:40] PhasedKitten: it says thats what is it! so it must be
[2:26:46] CT_5081_Boomstick: Add about 3-4 more zeros I think right?
[2:26:49] word51_: it is way more obviously Kappa
[2:26:49] bokernbabe: what have you done with ur money the last years?
[2:26:50] FrostBitey10: its definitely a lot more
[2:26:55] PhasedKitten: yeah

[2:27:26] PhasedKitten: well then

[2:27:28] FrostBitey10: KEKW
[2:27:32] PhasedKitten: i guess RICH STREAMER
[2:27:36] mironp: yeah
[2:27:48] PhasedKitten: yeah networth can change by politics
[2:28:00] djorn127: f*ck taxes man
[2:28:16] niotic1312: i ahve like 200 bucks
[2:28:25] kozbringerl: any particual reason ?
[2:28:27] word51_: you dont include any hypothetical taxes in your net worth
[2:28:28] djorn127: @niotic1312 I'm jealous
[2:28:40] Vegasmcswagger: barely 3 digits lmao
[2:28:44] djorn127: @word51_ they're not hypothetical if they're already paid
[2:28:48] FrostBitey10: i have barely three digits bruh
[2:28:50] CT_5081_Boomstick: I mean, You aren't REQUIRED to pay taxes... it just makes the governments of the world mad.
[2:28:52] The_Yazoo: I got level 10 in 2.3 hours, proud of me?
[2:29:06] popatzlegger: Can you give me some of your money? I need it to pay the next sub
[2:29:09] word51_: @djorn127 nope but he meant the taxes he would pay if he sould the appartment
[2:29:10] niotic1312: @The_Yazoo yes
[2:29:13] The_Yazoo: I just logged off, taking a break
[2:29:16] hansdevil: it s also fucked up. especially here in good ol germany. i have a friend dealing bmw and making around 120-150k a year. which is quite insane without a degree even in southern germany. He has to work like 20 years to afford a house i just get from my parents. meanwhile i work as well and everything gets more expensive. Can't beat having big luck with "rich" parents
[2:29:25] niotic1312: yeah guys
[2:29:26] djorn127: @word51_ ah okay, those do not count. indeed
[2:29:28] word51_: didnt he?
[2:29:38] niotic1312: going to sleep tommorow big party gl guys
[2:29:44] word51_: @djorn127 man i start questioning myself idk i am poor
[2:30:04] mironp: Well it is easy to have net worth in millions, you just have to be on a shit currency KEKW GIGACHAD
[2:30:06] djorn127: me too
[2:30:17] hansdevil: shit currency like euro?
[2:30:20] djorn127: @mironp that's not how it works man
[2:30:28] word51_: and the poor stay poor because they give rich people subs Kappa
[2:30:28] PhasedKitten: only the real Poor people can band together. food stamps
