[1:07:02] YOASjr: Jack create your own and invite only people you want
[1:07:02] dylansoyboy: I don't think so. People think of you when they think of VR Chat
[1:07:03] hamlife_: Sadge 󠀀
[1:07:04] xen0fox: lmao you deserve it more than half of the people on there
[1:07:04] PepegaAYAYA: Sadge

[1:07:05] aquapkz: @pewtanblot jnbHey
[1:07:06] SidewindeRj: nah that sucks bro

[1:07:06] zenkaaa: Sadge
[1:07:09] veritasECDW: Such a bullshit
[1:07:09] LuckySeattle: Sadge
[1:07:12] hjum: Sadge left out alone on the playground
[1:07:13] CallMeInfinity: idk man, I find it bullshit. You're friends with OTV and sooo many people. You fucking RPed from the START. And randoms get invited
[1:07:14] TheFlanimal: It's not a good time for you to have to deal with petty shit like this
[1:07:14] nobutterno: Sadge
[1:07:15] enemywithbenefits: Sadge he only wants to play with his friends
[1:07:15] PerfectKryme: What makes you think you aren't coming up soon Jake?
[1:07:16] clubfed11: its honestly kinda weird you're not....have you asked them?
[1:07:17] vodloser: Sadge
[1:07:18] Hykisho: slasher knows
[1:07:19] InnocentDuet: @jakenbakeLIVE Go back to duos with Zedd on Val
[1:07:19] Hykisho: and he wont tell
[1:07:19] dylansoyboy: That still doesn't make sense
[1:07:20] coolmint: insert ancient meme of Javert looking through the window

[1:07:30] SidewindeRj: you should be there Jake IMO
[1:07:31] pewtanblot: @CACA_LOCO No :)
[1:07:32] zoaofiron: <3 <3 <3
[1:07:32] draem: Def not entitled ...you should be on 100000%
[1:07:32] Shrinc: get good jake Kapp
[1:07:33] Genericooo: dont worry 50 more rust pros will get invited instead :)
[1:07:33] CallMeInfinity: to LSF peepoRiot
[1:07:33] pigdemon: its crazy that youll be on their youtube but not their server
[1:07:34] drummervibes: There’s nothing entitled about it, it’s a reasonable feeling, just don’t feel too down about it, Rust is cool but the meta will die
[1:07:34] Bullet_Drifter: Greek said the same thing. Sadge
[1:07:34] kegness: No invite because too many people vouched for you LUL
[1:07:34] SeruleanCity: i feel u boyo
[1:07:35] mushiwushi: hidden grudge? that's just so weird man Sadge
[1:07:36] hottcoffee: fuck em
[1:07:37] minotaur1225: Im praying youll get in eventually Sadge
[1:07:37] SplitLO: That’s still not a reason why tho
[1:07:37] vodloser: kinda weird jnbWC
[1:07:38] meow45521: I’m sorry katybeCry katybeCry
[1:07:39] ravrav256: ddos hjune
[1:07:40] therealbattyboo: i felt like you and andy added a lot of RP to the original OTV server...and facilitated a lot of opportunity for RP for everyone else as well
[1:07:41] SeruleanCity: <3 <3
[1:07:42] craigdelish: imagine not letting a GREAT roleplayer in because of something personal.....
[1:07:43] hjum: did you stole someones girl on the server or what forsenCD
[1:07:46] FCLiver: Hi LSF jnbHey
[1:07:49] burts: yeah still not a definite reason why
[1:07:50] Hykisho: can we do anything about that monkaHmm
[1:07:50] MisterJTV: some people are just fake.
[1:07:53] hotgamermilk: Not getting invited because too many people want you in doesn't make sense lol
[1:07:53] PlunkettTheGreat: !covidupdate4
[1:07:56] craigdelish: SO PROFRESSIONAL OTV WOW
[1:07:58] stargazed111: We love you jake ❤️❤️ <3 <3 <3 <3 <3
[1:07:59] iamchristianong: just talk to abe
[1:08:02] LooKeyBoy: someone involved might have it out for you
[1:08:02] YOASjr: They are being punks
[1:08:02] evolv3920: RIP JAKE PLAYING RUST jnbCmon
[1:08:04] bdunks02: wait they still havent given you access?!? wowow
[1:08:04] burts: straight up
[1:08:09] takowater: chill out chat :)
[1:08:11] YOASjr: Just make own
[1:08:14] YOASjr: Problem solved
[1:08:15] pewtanblot: @iamchristianong He already messaged Abe a few times already I think
[1:08:18] Bullet_Drifter: it took xqc long time too. they didn't respond to him for full day. he got invited just today.
[1:08:19] camburger_: feel like they couldve just copy pasted the whitelist from the last server
[1:08:23] Depereo: I think Abe has so many people asking him directly for invites that hes probably not trying to reach out to anyone
[1:08:24] minh131: x felt the same way for the very first server as well
[1:08:25] CallMeInfinity: Clout TV WEIRD
[1:08:25] SidewindeRj: but why though?
[1:08:28] hjum: yeah, be straight up, no trimming the fucking bushes
[1:08:28] Phantqm_: It's normal to feel left out there's no shame in that and you're not being entitled
[1:08:28] ReggieRudesocks: Then they add randoms LUL
[1:08:34] iamchristianong: @pewtanblot oh
[1:08:34] hamlife_: its WEIRD
[1:08:35] Mike_823: Messed up especially when they invited someonewith no mic who can’t even technically rp
[1:08:36] Tenal: I dont think myths on it either, I wouldnt sweat it jake
[1:08:38] TheFlanimal: Rob got in so easily though
[1:08:40] kaze_17: Why lie, just say the truth
[1:08:42] minotaur1225: Its all good Jake <3 Let it all out
[1:08:44] CACA_LOCO: If you want to perma chip to relieve some frustration we understand jake FeelsOkayMan
[1:08:45] xen0fox: It's who you know, not what you know
[1:08:45] PerfectKryme: i dont think it is too late
[1:08:46] KANZENNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNN: @jakenbakelive that doesn’t make sense.... it doesn’t and they’re not giving you the real reason.
[1:08:47] LuckySeattle: @mike_823, who
[1:08:47] AsapRafi96: @bullet_drifter full day? Jake asked a week ago
[1:08:49] kaze_17: just making you wait
[1:08:50] CallMeInfinity: @Tenal, But doesnt Myth choose not to be on it?
[1:08:51] Bigyun: @jakenbakeLIVE you deserve to be heard tho dude
[1:08:52] myst3001: they won't officially say anything because they don't want to be quoted
[1:08:53] PerfectKryme: I'd give it a week to see if you get it, Ryuu Tenga was great
[1:08:55] LooKeyBoy: how do.you not add a super sociable, well connected IRL streamer?
[1:08:58] CallMeInfinity: EXACTLY
[1:09:00] Tenal: @CallMeInfinity no he didnt get invited yet
[1:09:01] meow45521: From the outside in, doesn’t seem like friends t2tDenim3
[1:09:01] donat_jo: You’re too good for them
[1:09:02] CallMeInfinity: Its fucking BS
[1:09:02] Starwinpikachu: its never too late
[1:09:03] TheFlanimal: YEP
[1:09:05] eG_Rising: andy still not invited i think
[1:09:05] bdunks02: did you message baboabe? he had a tweet about it
[1:09:05] burts: a straight answer would be better than saying "just wait", that causes way more stress than needed
[1:09:06] gritz_n_pitz: J5
[1:09:06] CallMeInfinity: @Tenal, Oh, never knew

[1:09:42] kaze_17: Sadge
[1:09:43] mushiwushi: the weirdest thing is not telling you the reason straight up
[1:09:45] holeyroller: Place was awesome, apologies to the horses.
[1:09:46] 手裏剣: not enough clout to juice up the server admin FeelsBadMan
[1:09:51] ravrav256: get xqc to vouch for you
[1:09:54] PerfectKryme: Is it a SINGLE PERSON who is making the invite decisions? Is it an organization?
[1:09:56] SidewindeRj: they should just tell you though
[1:09:57] pigdemon: its weird cuz you personally interacted with abe through the church more than many
[1:09:57] Faedune: kinda cringe admin tbh
[1:09:58] Sl0thric: Sadge
[1:09:59] drummervibes: Just kinda sucks cause the Church RP has been kind of mid since most of the members aren’t there
[1:09:59] hotgamermilk: @jakenbakeLIVE abe was literally asking for people to vouch
[1:10:00] MisterJTV: if you get invited soon, I'd probably not even join. That's messed up jnbK
[1:10:04] LooKeyBoy: that's now why. you think you're more annoying than xwc frogs?
[1:10:07] hotgamermilk: :)
[1:10:10] nobutterno: you did do something. your hairline is sexy AF
[1:10:10] LooKeyBoy: *not

[1:10:16] dpmheat: KEKW
[1:10:17] carjod18: Jake your a irl god keep your head up. U will get invited
[1:10:20] kaze_17: @perfectkryme it is otv server so probably otv
[1:10:20] Hykisho: CACAs poll too KEKW
[1:10:21] LooKeyBoy: *xqc
[1:10:22] eG_Rising: yea abe asked for vouches so.. i dont get it
[1:10:23] ikillwchopstick: feels bad man
[1:10:23] stargazed111: That’s a pretty dump reason not to be invited
[1:10:24] hamlife_: it was good
[1:10:24] Asphyxiahh: I hope they add you Jake , you’re funny as fuck
[1:10:26] TheFlanimal: They're just scared of your RP skills jnbWC
[1:10:26] dylansoyboy: I don't think that's it. Even if you were being annoying, I don't think they'd hold it against you, with how prominent you are in the RP community
[1:10:27] SFLopezz: :)
[1:10:28] Bullet_Drifter: @ravrav256 Xqc barely got invited PepeLaugh he has not power to invited anyone he just said today LUL
[1:10:29] CACA_LOCO: @Hykisho PepeLaugh

[1:10:31] Prometheus_alGhul: it was
[1:10:33] Moisted_Melons: !covidupdate4
[1:10:33] Depereo: If its any consolation I think theres a lot of creators both big and small waiting to get in. Everyone in there is probably vouching for 10 other creators
[1:10:33] StreamElements: https://clips.twitch.tv/ExuberantTangibleGoblinKlappa
[1:10:35] Tenal: @jakenbakelive you definetley didnt jake, to play devils advicate myths a really close friend to OTV and he still hasnt been invited yet, trust me dont sweat it
[1:10:37] KANZENNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNN: @jakenbakelive it’s not annoying. They don’t know how to give you the truth. They side stepping yo bruh
[1:10:39] pewtanblot: Abe doesnt like bald guy Kappa

[1:10:54] insiderPStrader: you came off pretty entitled! All the players played on badlands which you decided to not play and decided to wit for the server you werent yet inviteded to
[1:10:55] kaze_17: @perfectkryme just sucks to not know
[1:10:55] poepx: myth is on the other server
[1:10:56] SFLopezz: pepePoint jnbO

[1:10:57] YOASjr: You can tell it really is affecting him
[1:10:58] CallMeInfinity: Thats what im saying... Myth seems ot enjoy the PVP server
[1:11:00] Gaberux: Myth just got invited yesterday I think, along with xqc
[1:11:03] TheFlanimal: You deserve a direct yes or no and an explanation at this point

[1:11:09] YOASjr: Jack you shouldn’t care
[1:11:10] PerfectKryme: Jake i think you have positive relations with that group; i think it is a matter of time. I doubt it is anything else beyond being "annoying by asking" I feel you man, but i am optimistic for the next week
[1:11:12] NonstopOtterpop: might be time to just leave it alone. at this point the less you talk about it the better imo
[1:11:14] evolv3920: they invited so more people on the RP server
[1:11:16] Aeslyn: they should just SAY. They let false expectations fester
[1:11:16] ravrav256: is knut on rp sever?
[1:11:18] pickleeflavour: I dont understand why youre not on the Rp server already

[1:11:32] drummervibes: Needs Carter too
[1:11:40] Sixoul: They have a lot of RPers on the pvp server tho
[1:11:42] hottcoffee: you wanna be with your homies Sadge
[1:11:42] CallMeInfinity: @PerfectKryme, Nonetheless man, its pretty frusterating. Jake has RPed from the start and wasn't invited while some "random" people were invited FeelsBadMan
[1:11:43] burts: it's not about being on the RP alone, it's about being separated from his friends
[1:11:44] poepx: abe is still mad about Uganda
[1:11:50] JAYYRROD: It's strange to me that you were a vital part of the restaurant and the church - two of the best RP groups. I feel like you would be one of the first ones invited based off that

[1:17:37] redfive80: @saintluk2 gta rp
[1:17:41] insiderPStrader: i highly doubt anyone is vouching, everyone on that server is trying to milk the server for views, you dont think most of the smaller streamers want to keep off as many streamers aas possible. I also dont get why you dont pplay badlands

[1:32:41] yuzuh: Good streamsFeelsOkayMan
[1:32:42] NiineEssence: @perfectkryme i cant imagine it be money. OTV itself is wealthy. There is a lot of people on the RP server where I have never seen them interact with OTV on stream with.

[1:33:50] BigTuckTV: KonCha @pepeteatime
[1:33:53] insiderPStrader: it seems toast and Abe makeing the calls cause toast called the need to included the xqc pvp players in divided or the server would die
[1:33:54] Feeleyfilms: i liked ninja's reply to your clout tweet
[1:33:54] auriel_j: You will get in sometime during the next couple days. Don't worry about it.

[1:34:00] KANZENNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNN: @feyhida_e how will it hurt if he’s not even invited?
[1:34:05] myst3001: in the end its just up to 1 guy

[1:34:09] drummervibes: Its pretty weird

[1:34:16] minh131: any guess to a reason if it was personal?
[1:34:24] LooKeyBoy: naaah, Jake has history with all the main players on the server. gotta be more to it.

[1:34:55] pewtanblot: @hianhianhian jnbHey
[1:34:55] LooKeyBoy: Jake goes waaaay back with a lot of people on there

[1:35:18] feyhida_e: @kanzennnn some of the streamers will watch it and won't like that he's speculating that someone doesn't like him. It's basically drama inducing.

[1:36:37] feyhida_e: @kanzennnn At this point atleast 5 people like soda, moon?, masa, rob, etc already vouched for him. Doing anything more is pointless?
[1:36:39] muunnks: how hard would it be for them to say yeah just wait or no instead of silence
[1:36:41] KEZERZ: Yeah its weird as fuck, you're so close to OTV
[1:36:41] nicktotton: somebody must not be very fond of you for a very bs reason that the vouch's didn't help

[1:37:34] erutnev: @Sp1z the game actually released in 2k13
[1:37:36] Mirror_Shield_40420: makes sense. it's your job and a 12hr stream would be a lot of content when you can't do irl
[1:37:36] pewtanblot: at this rate

[1:38:53] erutnev: @Sp1z I dont think so. The 2013 version was funnier for me. Streamers play it, the games get popular. Same shit happened with Among us.
[1:38:55] Valyri4nSteel: @kaze_17 Kissahomie

[1:41:09] feyhida_e: @kanzennnn so you want someone to come out and say yeah I don't like him on the server making him look like a sore loser? that'll help him lose friends, sure. It's also probably he gets 300-400 views when rust is on. Who knows. I say it's more destructive getting known as a drama baiter in front of "friends"

[1:41:38] Bullet_Drifter: don't tweet at anyone chat. peepoRiot doesn't work.
[1:41:42] nemesis12789: greek was wanting to join the rp server like 2-3 days before he even actually quit the pvp server because he was solo and bored and tired of pvping Sadge

[1:41:56] NonstopOtterpop: im a petty bitch and would probably not play on the rp server even if invited, out of spite at this point KEKW
[1:41:56] Enshoku: Well, it wouldn't be annoying if they just let you in. Then all that disappears for them.
[1:41:56] hirengames: maybe abe isnt the person managing the applications :(
[1:41:57] beelzebub_5: yeah Ray C was sad because people are asking him to vouch and he didn't feel comfortable because he said you haven't been accepted yet

[1:43:35] iamchristianong: @insiderPStrader that might be true
[1:43:36] MF_DOMSTA: Xqc made half the server rage and he still got in, I think it’s just a waiting game
[1:43:37] MisterJTV: he wants to play with his boys nothing wrong with that
[1:43:38] pewtanblot: @insiderPStrader He already asked Abe
[1:43:38] PoHuaiOP: are you bothered bc you helped your friends I'm and now you're alone

[1:43:54] sectual: you have every right to be pissed about this. I would have told them to fuck off by now probably
[1:43:55] PerfectKryme: I think directly speaking to the decision maker would help. "Yo can i get on the server? I was there before i would like to come back"

[1:44:10] RyuukSD: maybe vr tonight? Sadge
[1:44:11] TheFlanimal: Rust RP is about as close to IRL as you can get right now and you're being content cucked. It makes sense for you to be annoyed.
[1:44:14] Vulky123: Test your Water theory... then it will all make sense
[1:44:21] opwonkinobi: Jake make your own server, its easy to do.
[1:44:21] meow45521: m7famMJ sadge

[1:44:27] pewtanblot: @hackfuey jnbHey
[1:44:28] gritz_n_pitz: because there are only 3 members of the church LUL

[1:44:53] PoHuaiOP: of that the case Jake it's just a power trip tbh
[1:44:55] drummervibes: Makes no sense considering the church was the hallmark of rp on the last server
[1:44:56] Mendouja: ?????
[1:44:57] fearxdoom: Silverhand
[1:44:58] Tomzuki: At this point it's out of your hands, it's ok to be annoyed by this but don't dwell on it too much. Positive vibes <3
