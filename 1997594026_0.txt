[1:56:26] Zapp_Brannigan86: Do you think Otani goes to the Jays?
[1:56:38] Oceansevan: Take care of Juan. (from a Padres fan)
[1:56:58] tylerwithghosts: Ohtani to the dodgers is the most boring / predictable but probably the exact outcome sadge
[1:57:28] Zapp_Brannigan86: Blue Jays would be top contenders with him, i hope he comes here lol
[1:57:42] tylerwithghosts: As long as he doesn't go to the cubs I'm fine, as a disgruntled white sox fan that would be my 13th reason
[1:57:54] Celicon: hey @towelliee are guild raid on sod last night had a few no shows, a couple were saying there was a way to put a signup in discord. if I can figure that out is that ok with you?

[1:58:02] ayyeBanker: he going to cardinals, loves nootbar too much LUL
[1:58:32] 91Niki: Gattz is busy with work and school. So you gotta ask someone else
[1:58:34] Celicon: ok nice
[1:58:36] Sholmes2: @tylerwithghosts what do the Braves gotta do to get Cease Lol
[1:58:40] Zapp_Brannigan86: People didnt think Springer was gonna come to the Jays
[1:59:01] Celicon: ok
[1:59:08] tylerwithghosts: @Sholmes2 Infielders and top prospects and i'd be happy
[1:59:16] 91Niki: @Celicon Yeah Gattz is busy so you're gonna have to poke Sollice or Molv, and ask them
[1:59:27] Wulfgrym: @91Niki o7
[1:59:46] Sholmes2: @tylerwithghosts Vaughn Grissom you think
[1:59:49] Celicon: @91niki right on
[1:59:52] Celicon: we did
[1:59:53] Dalinaar: Almost always 10% of people will not show up.
[2:00:00] Dalinaar: so like 2 out of 25
[2:00:00] 91Niki: Gattz is busy suffering is minus temperatures on a field, putting up solar panels
[2:00:15] 91Niki: in*
[2:00:29] Celicon: @91niki that’s sounds fun rooBobble rooBobble
[2:00:45] 91Niki: @Celicon He doesn't think so LUL

[2:02:22] 91Niki: @Wulfgrym Been between -10 and -5C there during the day. He doesn't have great blood flow to his hands and feet. So he is suffering

[2:03:10] c0mmander_starscream: c0mmander_starscream subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 23 months! slootSmug
[2:03:17] DHedbor: imp would give extra stamina and fire shield so more health and thread, but succubus is more damage. Voidwalker could be used as an emergency cooldown (sacrifice) / off tank
[2:03:30] 91Niki: @Wulfgrym Just bought him some heated socks as an early christmas present. Hopefully those will help
[2:03:55] Celicon: @blackflagog sry it’s late for you, it’s right after I put my daughter to sleep
[2:04:07] Wulfgrym: @91Niki yeah im just mulling through my head if i got any gloves i can recommend
[2:04:18] mmrghost7: in raid u need stam and agi
[2:04:20] MackPlays: Voidwalkers are around 1700 health and 1500 armor
[2:04:26] MackPlays: Hard to kill
[2:04:47] SpilledMelk: Sac VW. Succubus also good for crowd control
[2:05:00] 91Niki: @Wulfgrym He uses hand warmers for his hands. No gloves are good when you do electrical work. It's either thin gloves and you can do work, or thick gloves that keep you warm and you can't work lol
[2:05:02] OneHotSlice: You can, but you cant equip it
[2:05:07] Dafrekknpope: corpsemaker requires lvl 29
[2:05:10] Wulfgrym: @91Niki if i think of anything ill pass along, i usually try out about 10-15 pairs of gloves a year
[2:05:12] OneHotSlice: There are still 2 good quest rewards (escort + necklace)
[2:05:19] LiviaLevels: Corpsemaker requires lvl 29
[2:05:19] gsting: some of the trash items are good
[2:05:25] OneHotSlice: And 28-30 Elites drop 25lvl BoE's (monkey, owl, etc)
[2:06:02] Wulfgrym: @91Niki yeah its the articulant part, hard to find good gloves for that
[2:06:07] 91Niki: @Wulfgrym Appreciate it :D He's got rechargeable handwarmers atm
[2:06:52] Wulfgrym: @91Niki cool, there are the battery powered milwalkee jackets as well some of my friends use them for winter work
[2:06:55] SpilledMelk: Isnt there a good tank staff from Arathi Basin rep?
[2:07:14] zx10rx: Man, tanking with warlock is so boring. Hope it improves with next phases
[2:07:19] 91Niki: @Wulfgrym Yeah I think he looked at those. It's only really his hands and feet that are the issue. The rest usually stays warm :p
[2:07:21] devilhawk83: should be able to do SM Graveyard
[2:07:54] Wulfgrym: @91Niki well if i think of anything ill dm you a link to check out but nothing at the moment
[2:08:01] im_capy: more basic that deruid tanking?
[2:08:04] 91Niki: @Wulfgrym :D
[2:08:05] im_capy: dam
[2:08:08] Cullarr: Searing pain is threat
[2:08:09] Buttscratchrr: most likely will be rune base some how
[2:08:12] Celicon: maybe like a new tree for warlock tanks?
[2:08:16] Snabido: Dmg = threat CoolCat
[2:08:16] Kelticlore: maybe have it where Lock tanking makes you summon then sac demons to get better threat
[2:08:27] Drixer07: What talents are you using atm?
[2:08:37] Ryhios: Yeah aoe is awful on warlock tank
[2:08:38] Lightasaurus: all they need to do is add one line into the metamorphasis rune for threat increase
[2:08:38] Merkkinz: destro spells were always huge soul fire, immolate, conflag
[2:08:44] Dynwor: hell fire
[2:08:49] zx10rx: Honestly its very lackluster. Rogue is even worse but warlock tank is also pretty bad
[2:08:51] Zirist: a multi dot rune would be insane for more dps/threat
[2:09:00] mmrghost7: they gotta increased base threat of wl tank back to 100%
[2:09:05] im_capy: They should have a type on concecration, dark energy or something
[2:09:15] Ryhios: Hellfire isn't usable on tanks because it's channeled
[2:09:28] Celicon: we fatebliss warlock tanking last night he was doing great
[2:09:31] Kelticlore: Do you think anything from SoD  will transfer to Retail
[2:09:39] Snabido: That touch was a menace
[2:10:05] Merkkinz: this is how they fix lore xD

[2:33:43] Ryhios: Especially on a pvp server
[2:34:01] Ryhios: It was terrible
[2:34:08] BobLongMVP: @towelliee thanks. I see locks asking for help in general chat, so I assume as long as you do it sooner rather than later.
[2:34:09] DHedbor: not a solo task but we did it with 3-4 warlocks and a druid to mix tank/heal
[2:34:30] ArcaneSyntax: There's 5 quests
[2:34:34] xmedpakx: there are 4 ut one cos from wetlands chain

[2:35:06] Ryhios: If you go to do it I would recommend being level 24 or 25 so you can actually attack the 30 elites
[2:35:23] Celicon: I kinda think that’s the point they were going for though, so much is in classic takes a ton of people, like I don’t think they want people to be able to Solo.

[2:36:00] BobLongMVP: @mackplays nope
[2:36:05] Ryhios: Yeah getting one of the orbs is doable solo with cheese and fear but the other one from Redbridge is like impossible solo
[2:36:07] ArcaneSyntax: You absolute could solo the paladin Divine Storm one around level 30
[2:36:21] DHedbor: the worst is the tower with level 29 warlock enemies in Darkshore. that place is hard at the appropriate level solo (nearly impossible)
[2:36:26] Celicon: only as a leveling dungeon
[2:36:29] raldrik: isnt doing these quests giving up an easy level

[4:21:59] nuuenergy: Blessing of freedom works as does druid shapeshift
[4:22:05] Lilpancakezz: just the one that slows but it removes other effect as well
[4:22:19] Lilpancakezz: 20 sec
[4:22:33] Molvonos: We'd be losing a lot of dps
[4:22:45] xmedpakx: what a bummer to lose both priests
[4:22:56] Lilpancakezz: 2 hunters and a rogue lol
[4:23:26] raldrik: If it is snares then shouldnt the gnome racial also remove it

[4:25:48] BubbaChubbs420: yes
[4:25:54] CousinAvi86: yes, mages have decurse but its not a curse
[4:25:55] HaxzorJimDuggan: correct only priest has dispel as of level 25
[4:25:56] Drinkthatmilk: Purge?
[4:26:01] Alaquane: but because it's also a snare. paladin can blessing of  freedom it
[4:26:14] Tiamarilien: seems so, pally is disease and poison
[4:26:17] Alaquane: if it were a curse. it would be ONLY Mage / Druid
[4:26:20] Amarlian: Druids also can remove curses
[4:26:31] Alaquane: priest cannot remove curse

[4:27:08] Mozzeyy_: drunk druids are the best though
[4:27:13] WoW_StandalonE: lol
[4:27:27] nuuenergy: Chains debuff is magic so only Priest can remove, BUT because it also is a slow, BoF and shapeshift as well as FAP remove it, changing it to a curse gives mages and druids the ability to remove as well as only preists have remove magic at level 25

[4:36:28] Celicon: I bought gold back in 2006 not going lie
[4:36:31] TheGiant99: It's because now people are to caught up in others buying things in games they can't and getting further then then with money.

[5:48:58] PvtHudson093: 15
[5:49:18] BrownSugarIsBae: thats what ive been saying @mavericks312 BG3 deserves it but Zelda does not lose GOTY historically

[5:49:19] moofia1980: too bad the show starts at 2am here in denmark :-(
[5:49:31] Sholmes2: I mean I like Zelda way more
[5:49:34] allisonkielle: nope
[5:49:41] BrownSugarIsBae: not when there is such heavy bias towards Zelda
[5:49:47] ArcaneSyntax: wow should have been nominated for best ongoing game
[5:49:49] Sholmes2: I thought so but I’m only one person
[5:49:53] MrSnekyDino: It's game of the year not franchise of the century
[5:49:55] captain_khyzan: think BG3 for sure.... i hate zelda games... so boring and slow
[5:50:00] mavericks312: there is heavy bias towards zelda games
[5:50:01] PvtHudson093: I love that Larion are still releasing new content patches for BG3
[5:50:11] polaropposite76: i was just about to say i think you have all the ichors lol

[5:51:10] runehako: i played both BG3 and Zelda ToK. Im a huge zelda fan and never played a DnD game before. BG3 was better.
[5:51:14] mavericks312: listen all im saying is if zelda wins goty i wouldnt be suprised at all
[5:51:19] MackPlays: To be fair the Zelda game coulda came out as an expansion
[5:51:26] FatalFlames: 108k playing RN as of 20 min ago
[5:51:28] BrownSugarIsBae: probably, but im also confident more people are playing TotK than BG3 right now worldwide. which isnt a failsafe for better game but its also wildly popular
[5:51:33] Syllvn: 100k right now
[5:51:51] moofia1980: playing BG3 multiplayer with my daughter, its super cool
[5:51:52] HaxzorJimDuggan: it did just get a new patch a few days ago
[5:53:00] mavericks312: imagine we get mind fucked an something like Sm2 wins goty lol
[5:53:14] mavericks312: worldwide more ppl played zelda then BG3
[5:53:19] Treevinal: I enjoyed Zelda way more, BG was too tedious for me
[5:53:26] HaxzorJimDuggan: im a huge zelda fan and hope it wins, but I would accept bg3 winning

[5:53:33] FatalFlames: They released stats the other day on Twitter and shit said people collectively spent like 8k years or something like that in the character creator in Bg3
[5:53:34] runehako: i'm one f those converted people
[5:53:37] ijuki: I mean, the whole event is a popularity contest
[5:53:42] gelimarr: I am one of those ppl
[5:54:08] TheGiant99: Wasn't bg3 in early access for like 2 years
[5:54:23] moofia1980: yep waited for 20 years for a new BG game to come out
[5:54:24] Syllvn: There has simply never been a crpg like BG3
[5:54:30] mavericks312: blizz could be worse they could only have 1 nomination like a certain "game of the generation"
[5:54:33] just_kirk_: for pally tank. Fast or slow 1h?
[5:55:02] geokouts: DING!
[5:55:15] notdxsty: dont have to take second row
[5:55:17] Bloodhaven08: you can skip a row
[5:55:21] moofia1980: yes you can go divine intellect
[5:55:22] EthicalHermit: There is no line, so its just points & level based
[5:55:23] Dellatus: Only if there is a linking line
[5:55:24] borisl0vehammer: I think its total points
[5:55:25] gum___: you can do int then straight to con
[5:55:49] FatalFlames: Yeah if it's green you can put points in it
[5:56:14] captain_khyzan: i know its not a direct correlation but.... BG3 6.2K Viewers atm... Zelda Tears 652 views... just saying
[5:56:25] mavericks312: just shows how crazy the last year in gaming is
[5:56:37] runehako: theres no best MMO genre
[5:56:44] ArcaneSyntax: FFXIV can have a huge content drought and still be nominated
[5:56:48] runehako: err category
[5:56:55] mavericks312: also geoff isnt he biggest blizzard guy
[5:56:55] BrownSugarIsBae: FF fans like the game a lot more than WoW fans like the game though
[5:57:26] captain_khyzan: yea.... anywhere 14 is nominated wow should of been... current population in wow is well over 500k more players
[5:57:31] Nokterian: you play ffxiv for two reasons thats the MSQ and transmog
[5:57:33] Syllvn: Wonder if it's a weird one as there's lots of versions of WoW rather than a collective single game hence the snub
[5:57:36] captain_khyzan: then 14
[5:57:38] kingg3d: its the story that makes the game at least for me
[5:57:41] mavericks312: @captain_khyzan id say you would have to check stats from when both were released sicne one is a SP game
[5:57:43] MackPlays: Blizzard probably just didn’t enter this year
[5:57:45] Slyxen: I never played FF14 except beta. I never thought I'd play WoW again, but here I am playing it, so
[5:57:48] BrownSugarIsBae: ask people who play WoW and half of them say they hate it but continue to play it. they aint voting for wow
[5:58:00] ronny_84: but a lot of those who play wow will take any chance they get to shit talk blizzard
[5:58:02] mavericks312: @MackPlays D4 is nominated
[5:58:18] Nokterian: i dont hate ffxiv fantastic storytelling other than that i play WoW
[5:58:19] MackPlays: @mavericks312 yeah ur right
[5:58:26] runehako: tbf WoW been around so long they have nothing to prove
[5:58:35] ronny_84: Yoshi P or whatever his name is can do no wrong
[5:58:40] im_capy: one of the top GW2 streamers moved to WoW, lots of FFXIV streamers are also playing wow too
[5:58:41] PhillyDilly18: Endwalker is 2 years ago today
[5:58:42] HaxzorJimDuggan: 21

[5:59:03] runehako: WoW in the game awards is like when jack nicholson goes to the oscars
[5:59:05] deanbeo: Yup
[5:59:07] Nokterian: There is a new expansion coming ffxiv next year
[5:59:11] Sholmes2: is it because it came to console
[5:59:13] geokouts: they are robbing WoW!!!
[5:59:17] TweektheProphet: it's because the folks who decided what is nominated are FF14 players
[5:59:18] carboncoral: next expansion  should be this summer
[5:59:44] AvrithSATX: It's b/c FF players are largely just a cult who believes FF14 is the pinnacle of existence.
[6:00:04] ronny_84: gunbreaker hard to play ?
[6:00:04] geokouts: the game award people are a little biased against Blizzard it seems...
[6:00:05] mavericks312: id argue ff14 wasnt even the best FF game this year

[6:00:41] mavericks312: there would be an MMO category and WoW still wouldnt be nominated
[6:00:47] Sholmes2: Def should be MMORPG category
[6:00:53] BrownSugarIsBae: and MMOs arent all that popular anymore compared to other genres
[6:01:05] brentosxd: wish they'd made the show a bit more eu friendly, it starts at 2am for me
[6:01:08] REALPolarbeezy: personal im sure
[6:01:10] mavericks312: @runehako i think geoff learned from TLOU 2 year where ppl checked out on it winning everything
[6:01:11] Bloodhaven08: for the game
[6:01:11] MackPlays: 3 day personal is what i heard
[6:01:13] HaxzorJimDuggan: its a set reset
