[0:23:32] lepermessiah4484: What is your plan for leveling? Will you be questing in open world or dungeon spamming? Or are you waiting to see what Blizz drops for their "new leveling methods"?
[0:23:48] luzid7: 2 mobs no homies and still winning xD
[0:25:05] luzid7: my plan was to boost myself with my mage in stockades but i would miss all the runes

[0:34:38] F3llOwOw: @wing_dingy is it a addon?

[0:36:24] saund: what race for warrior do you think ahs upper hand?
[0:36:31] russsl: in a group ofc warrior is good. some 1v1 potential would be cool though
[0:36:34] lepermessiah4484: I feel like boomkins will be even stronger now, stun chance and additional crit on starsurge is gonna be mean
[0:36:43] DanielDaManiel92: Im not lookin forward to level 40 Warrior with combat charge and intercept lol
[0:37:17] luzid7: oh shit people using that talent that gives your firespells a chance to slow people that will be insane
[0:37:44] russsl: give bladestorm

[0:37:58] luzid7: @Atokes hell nah
[0:38:29] Psycho_Score: As a feral I have to say I hope they make us better in pvp balance outshines it just massivly
[0:38:33] DanielDaManiel92: It'll be cool when starsurge has a 15% chance to stun for 3 seconds
[0:38:45] wing_dingy: Mike ybarra quitting?
[0:38:53] ano_xy: the real question is ... how much are they hurt rogues - cause if they get any more utility it'll be GG's for most ...  And if they announce CoS ... population of rogues will increase A LOT
[0:39:01] wing_dingy: 1,900 layoffs from microsoft gaming
[0:39:03] wing_dingy: rough days
[0:39:06] russsl: i mean shamans. locks running around with tank runes with 30%  damage reduction. epic sword melee for like 90

[1:10:16] codelean: wrath now most overhyped expansion of all time for me
[1:10:56] peepboobb: hello hydra can you make a guide on how to 1v30 these people?
[1:10:56] trixthemvp: sucks to hear man, enjoying sod?
[1:11:48] ikbenpro: No mana cost and free proc on mind blast would be a nice rune :P :P :P
[1:12:03] konexi: What do you think about Priest in P2 esp. Shadow will the Shadow form be the carrie?
[1:12:13] rampage60232: yo hydra do you always send devouring plague
[1:12:19] DrWarz: still level 25???
[1:12:26] codelean: and the warmane scripters only play 2s, 3s dead
[1:12:36] codelean: cata will be worse. cata 2s suck balls and 3s already dead
[1:12:59] jazni_23: i had two different servers go all one faction in wrath forcing me to reroll twice
[1:13:41] codelean: reroll warlock is the way maybe KEKW
[1:15:11] codelean: watch the second best awc team on retail. their shaman scripting in 3s as well
[1:16:33] trixthemvp: personally have never tried sod, only have enough time to casually play wotlk and do icc, but seeing wotlk very quiet and people playing sod might have to give it ago cause im not playing cata. Gonna play cata?
[1:16:51] lil__dolo: !p2tier
[1:17:32] Mystylerocks: hello lads
[1:17:53] codelean: you cant come into melee range of him, his script instant knocks any melee dashing to him
[1:18:04] codelean: its wild actually
[1:18:25] Snewch: @codelean I faced a warrior that was the opposite too, if you knocked him he would instantly leap or charge but like in an obvious botting way
[1:18:33] Extramediums: been fighting warriors who bladestorm stuns perfectly every time lately
[1:18:44] Extramediums: or any other cc for that matter
[1:19:14] Mystylerocks: random thought, instead of an OP Cloak rune , we could see an evasion % to dodge spells and projectiles like.. 20%?;p
[1:19:18] BurizaDoKyan0n: Can you tell me, is the transfer from Lone Wolf to Living Flame active?
[1:19:23] Qtxo1: https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-67680336
[1:19:34] codelean: blizzard just have no funds of doing any anticheat

[1:20:25] svettsune: go ashenvale mate, you need all the rep you can get ;)
[1:20:28] codelean: @nelsonrds microsoft let 1900 blizzard employees go today KEKW
[1:20:36] Snooqzz_: KEKW
[1:20:55] codelean: i feel offended
[1:21:04] bcalicore: they let go 1900 of their gaming division
[1:21:09] bcalicore: overlap from the merger
[1:21:09] codelean: 1900 as in number of people KEKW
[1:21:12] stuttersx: 10% of the gaming employees yea
[1:21:21] codelean: most of them blizzard employees
[1:21:25] Snewch: Prob like 3 now
[1:21:33] stuttersx: maybe microsoft as a whole
[1:21:34] Hodgins: its 1900 across microsoft
[1:21:39] bcalicore: The cuts represent around 9% of the 22,000 Microsoft Gaming employees and come three months after Microsoft closed on its $69 billion acquisition of Activision Blizzard.
[1:21:50] Fekk0r: That's 10% of Micrsoft gaming department (which includes blizzard)
[1:21:51] nelsonrds: "The cuts work out to roughly 8 percent of the overall Microsoft Gaming division that stands at around 22,000 employees in total"
[1:21:58] nelsonrds: nvm
[1:22:11] wrec7: most of them blizzard
[1:22:15] codelean: reports say most of the 1900 are from blizzard
[1:22:19] Leelee1997: the bulk of which are from Activision Blizzard
[1:22:43] bcalicore: dun worry they were all the bot dectors
[1:22:55] Leelee1997: sparked in part by mass hiring during the gaming surges of Covid, but now shrinking back
[1:22:58] Leelee1997: is basically the reason
[1:23:10] Toppers25: @Hydramist  what realm is this priest on?
[1:23:19] lepermessiah4484: New phase, new dev team LUL
[1:23:32] Leelee1997: thata tunnocks wafer
[1:23:35] Leelee1997: banger if so
[1:23:44] jezzi23: If let go of 10% of SOD employees. Would it round up to 1 employee or down to 0?
[1:23:47] nelsonrds: @lepermessiah4484 fresh ideas ahahhaha
[1:23:47] Leelee1997: best things
[1:23:50] Leelee1997: with a cup of tea

[1:26:47] Leelee1997: yeah they are pretty much the same but instead of chocolate its caramel outside with toasted coconut
[1:26:50] wing_dingy: Chimera shot pops
[1:27:38] wing_dingy: also I would be interested to see about chimera vs armor
[1:27:42] wing_dingy: since its nature damage
[1:27:49] Leelee1997: swear you'll be having a combo of a tunnocks wafer original and a caramel log if you try them
[1:29:15] bcalicore: surviving bestial wrath seems unfun
[1:29:19] Leelee1997: tea cakes are a bit controversial though from tunnocks, bit like marmite either love em or hate em
[1:30:02] ama__deus: @Hydramist tried shadow a bit and mind sear black outs and shared pain black outs are actually hilarious KEKW should be fun p2
[1:30:37] rerkyz: if you wouldn’t land second faer it might be lose
[1:30:51] Leelee1997: making myself crave chocolate lol
[1:31:01] wing_dingy: ama the mind sear blackouts in blacksmith clash in AB is going to be so oppressive

[1:36:12] htvizzle: 25 was nice to see what class u wanna main, good for lvlin alts etc, but 40+ is when classes actually feel decent
[1:36:22] prodigy_wow: Resist drain is a feels bad man
[1:36:23] ganjjathegoblin: hydra, im liking your disclaimer on the tierlist. you got me good, mate
[1:36:46] htvizzle: balance wins all)
[1:36:54] Jonkoklapp: Jonkoklapp subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 14 months! 14 months big pump here
[1:36:56] vzznnn: Balance does not win all LUL
[1:36:57] prodigy_wow: I wonder if low key, taking off the lifedrain rune makes warlock beat priest since its spammable without rune
[1:37:06] ganjjathegoblin: "if youve skipped to the end..."
[1:37:07] htvizzle: @vzznnn what does it lose to then
[1:37:30] vzznnn: @htvizzle shamans, a good lock, a good priest
[1:37:59] htvizzle: lock cant win, u beat pri by not using MF/sunfire + ooming him, shaman is tough if they cheese but u can also win
[1:38:06] vzznnn: all depends on RNG too
[1:38:27] Sinostra: Hey Hydra, how are you doing ?
[1:38:57] Sinostra: @htvizzle never duelled a boomy, but their trinket can't even break fears
[1:39:06] Sinostra: so how does a lock lose to a boomy ?
[1:39:10] htvizzle: @Sinostra yes it does
[1:39:16] htvizzle: and u just root lock + outrange drain
[1:39:23] htvizzle: he cant kill u before you oom

[1:41:59] prodigy_wow: was thinking that too
[1:42:09] Uprimex: Boomkin is broken man
[1:42:20] prodigy_wow: I think inner focus is strong in this match up
[1:42:22] htvizzle: he is using alot of moonfires still
[1:42:26] htvizzle: u can beat him
[1:42:26] prodigy_wow: you can gain alot of momentum with Dplague
[1:43:02] htvizzle: it ticks for like 36 dmg for me
[1:43:04] htvizzle: MF that is
[1:43:13] vzznnn: I've beaten moonfire in 1v1s by just double dot/homunc and healing my self the whole duel but that was vs his slightly less geared boom alt
[1:43:24] cryptomeganinja: dispell wild growth 60 hp + per tick (1sek)
[1:43:29] htvizzle: ye but he is also playing pretty mana inefficient atm
[1:43:33] Ksantor: !build
[1:43:37] htvizzle: its a pure mana war
[1:44:00] Ksantor: what build mr.Hydra using for wsg?

[7:33:45] theEntropie: They drop Purr of the Faith and Scratches of the Feline
[7:36:23] Mystylerocks: meta locks has to be the least threatening field on the bg
[7:36:24] benyask27: Mekkora zene te geci
[7:36:27] Mystylerocks: he tickles us
[7:36:47] Sinostra: @Mystylerocks it looks so cringe aswell
[7:37:21] Mystylerocks: haha yea a guy jumping around, i mean if i ever played the meta spec in bg i would go 5/5 corru and then 10 into destro and the one that causes daze
[7:37:29] Mystylerocks: to at least be more annoying dazing everyone with SP spam
[7:39:38] htvizzle: is it a "true" daze?
[7:39:40] htvizzle: or just slow
[7:39:43] Mystylerocks: u can do it now too , it probably is a bit annoying with all the dazing but thats it, u just soak and annoy
[7:39:53] Sinostra: daze is just 10% proc chance
[7:39:57] Sinostra: it's not that good
[7:40:10] Sinostra: the wotlk version is waaaaaaaaaay better
[7:40:21] Mystylerocks: not many other routes u can go for as meta lock atm but i agree
[7:40:29] Mystylerocks: and u get shadowburn too most likely
[7:41:27] Sinostra: @Mystylerocks who are you in the group btw ?
[7:41:49] Mystylerocks: I'm MSR ^^
[7:41:52] Mystylerocks: my style rocks
[7:41:56] Sinostra: oh yeah
[7:41:59] JavaSkrpt: Not nearly enough tension
[7:42:00] Sinostra: makes sense
[7:42:04] JavaSkrpt: but still satisfying
[7:42:33] JavaSkrpt: I'll check the VOD. Later Hydra.

[7:45:15] Skipiz852: do you think the kelris staff might stay bis for next phase too ?
[7:45:38] theEntropie: I vendored my ignition by accident
[7:45:46] htvizzle: you can probably restore it
[7:45:49] htvizzle: it lasts like 30 days

[7:46:01] theEntropie: =O
[7:46:30] Sinostra: we're gonna spend our entire lives in bfd bro
[7:46:30] TrebekTv: tbh at 40 you could go back and like 3-5 m bfd id say
[7:46:31] peeweeherman69: their will be a rare staff with similar stats at 40 100% wont be much better if so
[7:48:27] theEntropie: Main downfall of disc is that you are playing disc instead of shadow
[7:48:52] bomzzwtf: resto druids are s tier now as well tbh
[7:50:09] bomzzwtf: I find it easier to solo heal bfd as resto over disc
[7:51:05] inspect4: i feel like ret got all the love in p1, hope holy gets some in p2 aswell
[7:51:29] KALOVAYA_MACCA_CTACA: @bomzzwtf nobody is talking about pve, this is pvp
[7:52:38] htvizzle: they struggled on mana aye, but WS is sexy
[7:53:33] kjlor: should wait for rune annoucements for rankings
[7:54:40] htvizzle: who says they announce any runes
[7:54:48] kjlor: rogues will get smoke bomb imo
[7:56:13] theEntropie: Shadow getting vamp touch and becoming best healer with vamp embrace
[7:56:25] Oztecx: professional tierlister 100%
[7:56:27] DISLIKEABLEFULLCAPSNAME: wtf is that graph
[7:56:58] NibJO: going back to bfd for wbuff sounds worse
[7:58:05] peeweeherman69: the ilvl of the druid weap already leaked is 40 isnt the staff 35 ilvl so assuming all gear is 40 ilvl stats wont be much better
[7:58:14] kjlor: blizz should bring back red buff killing spree rogues
[7:58:16] HanokGaming: is there any official time when on 8th we getting second phase?

[7:59:48] Sinostra: didn't you want to do an advice for all skill levels video ?

[8:04:36] classiccyb: link?
[8:04:59] vmttmv: after next phase more buttons to press, considered redoing the bind vid(s) for sod? might get views as i guess ppl search for sod stuff specifically now
[8:05:31] vmttmv: for wotlk classic you have
[8:05:47] Sinostra: that could be a good idea
[8:05:47] theEntropie: Can we have a 8h stream of "How to MC people in Ratchet"
