[2:42:59] GamerKillance: Shame too cause WOTLK hardly had anything to do. It was all insta-access to raids with no work. Dungeons were boring and everything was too easy until heroic came out
[2:43:12] SilentnSean: LUL
[2:43:13] GamerKillance: WOTLK was just ZZZZZ. Had it not been for arthas I doubt many would remember it foundly
[2:43:24] narutoinblack: Exactly^
[2:43:27] Hybridwarhawk: We gonna have a good time when TBC launches for sure
[2:43:36] theoriginalzinng: you got room in the guild for a fresh boost?
[2:43:36] Moobot: Check out Towelliee's latest Youtube video! https://youtu.be/U8-64zqVa8k Shadowlands needs some help
[2:43:53] PokerFaceMoose: i think the removal of the barriers is why so many remember it fondly. a lot of people dont like attunements
[2:43:55] GamerKillance: Leveling zones were good though
[2:44:09] narutoinblack: Grizzly Hills only one I liked
[2:44:21] Rexialiton: I'm gonna split-stream between you and Soda <3

[2:44:51] Broomba: 150 guild members on
[2:44:52] JayBeKay: I'm trying to find news
[2:44:55] AtomicHeartSon: I tthink it'll be fun to do once
[2:45:02] tarot_with_tricia: TBC is where I had the most fun.
[2:45:02] stallowned: if u did the ony attunement, the BC ones will be easy
[2:45:11] rhodeos_: only difference now is i actually know how to get attuned
[2:45:16] Holysal: @JayBeKay bc its not 6pm est yet
[2:45:22] GamerKillance: It gave us something to do at least. WOTLK got rid of the leg work and everyone just got in. Hell content ran dry so quick in WOTLK. Again Arthas is the only reason it was remembered fondly. TBC gave us a lot to do
[2:45:26] Osskssa: jesus 150 members on, thought my guild was popping with 60
[2:45:30] ilskarius: @Towelliee Is that the portal behind you?

[12:45:32] offspringer: @towelliee  what's your favorite wow expansion
[12:45:48] Spintaru: TBC or Wrath
[12:46:27] Hick12: Couldn’t the hunter remove enrage?
[12:47:07] Chiraakitteh: I’m almost afraid to yank Outland dungeons, my experience so far this last month is that dps go whole hog on everything and my bear just can’t generate enough aoe threat on everything... retail has still instilled terrible habits into us as players
[12:47:13] Chiraakitteh: tank*
[12:47:18] cruzeal: wrath KEKW
[12:47:18] Bombayshow: wrath of the recycled things :)
[12:47:44] peryduel: why do u hate wrath?!?
[12:47:54] Spintaru: i started watching you back in TBC...
[12:47:54] NewWorldReign: wrath naxx was that bad too?
[12:48:00] MarquisLek: argent rep was legit
[12:48:06] MarquisLek: the dailies were the best
[12:48:13] VaraliNama: Wrath was my fav
[12:48:14] Edoscil: glad you stayed
[12:48:18] Avaricious_83: Classic Wrath. Log in, sit in Grizzly for an hour. Log out!!
[12:48:18] KaervekFC: I enjoyed Wrath right up until Tournaments of Champions dropped.  ToC was the beginning of the "easy mode" WoW in my opinion.
[12:48:20] CrunkyBrewster: i guess for guys like me Wrath was our first taste of raiding.
[12:48:22] Spintaru: "We have come full circle now"
[12:48:29] Ranger208: Without Algalon there is no Towelliee.
[12:48:30] ChalupaBatman25: Wrath will be my favorite expansion that was when i was at my most hardcore. i went from being an off tank for alt nights on my raid guild in tbc to being the #1 prot paladin on my server
[12:48:39] CrunkyBrewster: yeah same
[12:48:42] ChalupaBatman25: i never did classic naxx so naxx in wrath was awesome for me
[12:48:54] Moobot: you can figure out how long you've been following any channel by simply clicking on your own name in chat :)
[12:48:55] CrunkyBrewster: but i get it. i get why a lot of vets dont like it as much
[12:49:06] timmythegamertv: Praise our Lord and Saviour Algalon!!!
[12:49:11] OldManChickenLegs: What expansion was out in like 2010-2011 I think that’s when I found towelliee
[12:49:18] Kahoolo: You not like the Arthas fight in WOTLK?
[12:49:30] fatsotuna: @Towelliee the last stream of yours I remember watching was heroic shamans in siege of orgrimaar. It's been way too long boss
[12:49:40] CrunkyBrewster: 2010/11? Cata I think
[12:49:44] Hick12: @oldmanchickenlegs Cata
[12:49:51] tadeeche: think late cata early MoP?
[12:49:51] timmythegamertv: Your saying we won't have ICC dance offs when it's current content!!
[12:49:57] L1ghthoof: first time I saw towelliee was his ui video in cata
[12:50:02] CrunkyBrewster: i found towelliee around the MoP beta days
[12:50:17] OldManChickenLegs: Man dood that doesn’t make me feel any younger :(
[12:50:49] OldManChickenLegs: I used to have a cata poster up on the wall back then
[12:50:59] CrunkyBrewster: well im 45 now. so that was almost 10 years ago. hard to believe
[12:51:31] TheOGDaywalker: respect the grind. Good luck on the marathon
[12:51:33] we_are_whomp: should kill him when you hit 70
[12:51:45] Gotshadow: Hope you're well man
[12:51:55] ChalupaBatman25: oh god T that hurts my soul lol
[12:51:57] gamill: Over CATA?
[12:52:02] JWoody82: The whole classic thing has to end after wrath right?
[12:52:05] OldManChickenLegs: jokrdDel jokrdEte jokrdChar
[12:52:13] Eraste: whats funny is i played more bfa than wrath
[12:52:17] Avaricious_83: Free the Slaves... of their mortal shakles LOL
[12:52:19] L1ghthoof: towHorde towHorde
[12:52:26] bgriff87: BFA started out as one of the worst but ended up being a decent expansion IMO
[12:52:29] gamill: @JWoody82 They will go till people stop playing
[12:52:30] Eraste: but i did like wrath better. mostly cause i pvp'd a ton
[12:52:38] MackPlays: Cata remake and after wouldn’t make sense because it’s the “new world”
[12:52:38] JerBoody: So with you bro wrath when as good but so Over rated
[12:53:04] Arthur_eld: @JWoody82 I know a lot of pvpers would like MoP
[12:53:10] CrunkyBrewster: I almost go in the order of the expansions. Wrath/BC/MoP/Legion/Cata/WoD/BFA/SL
[12:53:16] fatsotuna: wrath was just dodge the DKs that thought every spec was tank spec and blue gear was good enough to pug VH ><
[12:53:17] croppeast: starting to catch up towelliee :D
[12:53:36] CrunkyBrewster: Level 60 BGS > DKs Everywhere
[12:53:42] StoicTaurus: When you free NPC you get nature resistance buff
[12:53:46] Avaricious_83: Yeah you need to talk to the guy in the cage for the buff
[12:53:53] croppeast: Got a premade group that i joined that are AoE clearing Slave Pens...boost of moral. The exp is sweet
[12:54:00] AKLumberjack16: i started in cata so if i goback to playing wow ill probly just play  what is current
[12:54:44] Arthur_eld: Bring out Legion Classic
[12:55:00] croppeast: Just a personal goal to keep up with you :D

[21:38:12] Cryttan: I think it's funny and I think it's deserved, they're actively supporting choices that are making the game worse. I actually considered buying the deluxr shit. I wouldn't mind if people /spit on me.
[21:38:15] Buckwink: 15 minutes
[21:38:17] Korveinous: My goal is to get the /sigh at least 10 times a day for mob tags

[21:38:24] Curtis_101: Yah thats some hypocritical crap, lol, Amon gets fed gold, gear, raid runs, everything. And complains someone pays for a mount only those who pay get. Lame
[21:38:31] Lonan_Reigns: In general people are helpful and good in game, for those few doing the spiting, jellie much!!!!

[21:39:40] Naturalbeef: Most people who get mad at store mounts are too stupid to know you can use in-game gold to buy them
[21:39:45] ShadyWizWolf: @ensanee it's considered spam so there's that
[21:39:48] Alepouditsa: meh just move on
[21:39:58] Nikkifay: server list is up

[21:40:11] DemonicWolf_28: how is buying a store mount different from paying gold to get carried for a mount in game?
[21:40:13] DragonofWolves: its a stupid ass thing to do is what hes refereing too
[21:40:13] Collected1: i think blizzard should hand out a ban to anyone who encourages that in game
[21:40:16] Frank4LuLz: my mists of pandaris special mount, how can you spit on that mount, people suck

[21:41:28] Ekvision: huh i heard banned? who what where?
[21:41:30] Nikkifay: I mean why is spit even in game
[21:41:31] SonofHorus82: I just report them for harassment and block them. Imagine taking time to create and use a spit macro because I spent my money how I felt. If you think I shouldnt have done so then I can send you my account info for you to start paying my sub. Then you can have an opinion on how I play.
[21:41:37] Frank4LuLz: nope the world is coming to a end....run
[21:41:39] Collected1: CrankyPanzer : I personally see no reason for /spit to be in a 2021 MMO personally
[21:41:44] Collected1: it can only ever be negative
[21:42:06] CrankyPanzer: @Collected1 purely for HvsA roleplay events
[21:42:09] desmo7: can you get banned for an ingame emote?
[21:42:13] tyrel_jones: idk man, there some kinky spitters out there
[21:42:14] DragonofWolves: I think what sloot was actually saying, that to /spit on someone for having a store mount is pointless because who the hell cares what you spend your money on

[21:43:02] DragonofWolves: I mean, I've only gotten one store mount i think. The other store mount i have, i won from a giveaway blizzard was doing
[21:43:03] StarbuckTech: watching the stream and working... love working from home ;)
[21:43:05] sp4nky80: i mean if you want to spit on someone spit on afk honor farmers lmao

[21:43:40] Alepouditsa: yes i was spit to but i don't know y don't look at me i have no mount i was runing naby that y danBlank
[21:43:41] DragonofWolves: isnt that an eamote in-game /fart?
[21:43:47] cavi_XD: I mean, IDK the /spit thing doesnt seem like a big deal. Intentional and consistent harassment is pretty sad though
[21:43:49] theoriginalzinng: make a drive by that farts and says "drive-by!"
[21:43:53] IZemekiSI: yeah i dont think it would be as big an issue if there wasnt certain people pushing it. then trying to blame others for pushing it lol
[21:43:53] Moobot: Check out Towelliee's latest Youtube video! https://youtu.be/U8-64zqVa8k Shadowlands needs some help
[21:43:53] theoriginalzinng: make a macro*
[21:43:56] Unciatim: @dragonofwolves Actually.. it tends to extend to other toxicity.. griefing, group ijnvites for dungeons then kicking cause you boosted, etc.....  basically its just bad manners in general...
[21:43:57] dym_jt: I had zero queue on a full EU server at 3:30 PM @Towelliee :P
[21:44:10] abbec95: why is server down?
[21:44:10] Ekvision: I never even thought about spitting on someone for having a store mount. It's there money let em spend it on what they want

[21:44:12] Nimz83: I spit on people that take my quest items when I'm fighting stuff. But that is something I consider scumbag.
[21:44:15] ShadyWizWolf: I've personally been spat on for riding a store mount at one time. what did I do? told them to mind their own business and then reported them for spam.
[21:44:20] Ballavar: i own everything on the blizz  store and it was bought using in game currency cuz wow tokens are used to buy shit on there lol
[21:44:21] DragonofWolves: Unciatim well yeah i understand that. as i said its pointless and just stpud as hell to do
[21:44:25] Templexx: impressed with servers. i didnt dc yesterday.
[21:44:26] Frank4LuLz: fuck feralina
[21:44:48] QQisLIVE: is T4 content open this week ?

[21:44:58] Buckwink: are all the TBC raids short?
[21:45:03] taba83: KZ is not short
[21:45:05] Drengarth: @Towelliee Had 16k+ queues for 2-3 weeks on classic release (Gehennas) so I was pretty happy today comming home from work not having any at all
[21:45:05] v3ritas151: kara so awesome, I like grull too

[21:45:13] wondersandwitch: @Towelliee what lvl are u
[21:45:18] Curtis_101: Theres so much worsxe behavior (hacks/exploits/gold farmers/irl money services, raid run services, 2400 carries, tokens, etc etc). People giving money to Blizz which funds more devs and a better game is just not important.....its pure jealousy. "I play non-stop and every reward should only be given to me!"
[21:45:24] theoriginalzinng: that will be another nice boost in income for blizzard when they do lol

[21:45:55] wizzanoo: sometimes you cant even clear karazhan intill half the group has so much gear to get over threshold
[21:46:01] cavi_XD: Yo i wanted to try those Qwest bars, how are there @Towelliee

[21:47:54] no_case: cool cool
[21:47:56] Ballavar: @jacooners someone would always be fucked over
[21:47:57] DragonofWolves: Well that being said. Towelliee didnt blizzard say that for Sunwell, Mu'ru was going to be pre-nerf not post-nerf
[21:48:00] SonSonVellano: How’s the marathon going! Any good loot?

[21:48:41] DragonofWolves: true true, ya'll have fun with that lmao
[21:48:45] 1800Contacts: pre-nerf with the spell pushback change though right
[21:48:47] Zinnister: what level are you at now Towelliee?
[21:48:52] Nimz83: Seems like TK should be pre-nerf also. I think that with all the resources players have today that they can kill Kael
[21:48:52] onous_: I had good luck back then on mounts. Not so much now.
[21:48:54] QQisLIVE: Strawberry Nutrigrain ? Apple? Must know haha
[21:48:57] Sablehawk_TV: Morning
[21:48:57] TehSquiggums: Nah Nutri-grain
[21:49:11] DragonofWolves: I mean it could be worse. We could be in WoTLK classic against Algalon the guild killer
[21:49:13] iceproxx: tow you going aldor or scryer ?
[21:49:16] Leboosh_: I think sunwell will be easier compared to then, just because of all the information and better latency/fps. Still way harder than other raids though

[22:55:04] hammack52: @Towelliee if you are just questing and moving from mob to mob just use command, if you are fighting something that is going to live for a while than you will do cursader for the holy and crit buff
[22:55:05] Pegazustorm: Worst last talent spell ever
[22:55:06] SonofHorus82: Not crusader, command. shit trying to work and watch at the same time.
[22:55:11] KinRL: prot is fine for leveling it just requires gear
[22:55:15] xideontv: oh the two judgements, i don't miss that
[22:55:24] hammack52: @Towelliee you pretty much want to use Crusader strike on cd
[22:55:28] Shrenko: its not
[22:55:39] mulletrocker11358: judge light keep command up i believe
[22:55:40] Tinmarw: what?? without crusader strike you dont have anything
[22:55:44] IianaDRK: its not bad, its cheap and hits pretty hard. also refreshes every judgement on the target so helps holy pally judgements
[22:55:44] MuttonChopins: crusader strike always on cd, hammer of wrath only when they are far away
[22:55:49] hammack52: dont listen to that about the last talent that guy is just trolling you
[22:55:54] goddammitwalter: its the only pure attackibg ability dude what are you talking about
[22:56:02] nephandis: hammer of trap ability
[22:56:04] Snilleblixten92: hammer on 2 spots :p
[22:56:05] Waspire: when ever its off cooldown

[22:56:53] ArcaneSyntax: @Towelliee some 2h work better with righteousness, because of speed, but most of the time command is your bread and butter.
[22:56:54] Sh4nti: Don't use top rank for every seal, Rank 1 is usually good enough
[22:56:55] Siglius: @Towelliee It's better than command if you have a 3.4 or faster weapn speed.
[22:56:55] MuttonChopins: yeah he is play on EU @DragonReb0rn
[22:56:56] Waspire: greater wisdom
[22:56:57] hammack52: @Towelliee thing Arms warrior for what weapon you want to go for
[22:57:01] SonofHorus82: Seal of Wisdom is still ok to use, but Crusader/Command is best.
[22:57:18] purekappa123: If weapon below 3.5 speed use rightnusness, at 3.5 use command @towelliee

[28:34:45] jerexify: @Lulaboo You alright? lmao Seems like someone may have touched a nerve at some point.
[28:34:52] Gendread77: people look down on boosting because they worked hard to get where they are and now someone drops some money and they get close to where some others goto with lot of hard work.
[28:34:56] BRUTALIT0PS: LOL, no worries Gatt, Nite and I are just questing atm anyway
[28:35:01] BRUTALIT0PS: Kids are being nuts today

[28:35:47] Unciatim: but not sorry
[28:35:48] BRUTALIT0PS: ONLY 5 kids!
[28:35:50] Gendread77: ive boosted twice once on NA and once on EU, ive also been leveling a toon , i enjoy both. the boost is nice cause you can get up to the current content, and do TBC without having to spend 2-3 weeks to get a toon to max level.
[28:36:10] kedrius_: Blizzard should have given everyone one boost for free tbh
[28:36:26] Znza: everyone plays at their pace, its their $15 :D even if it was free it shouldnt matter
[28:36:34] Wulfgrym: @Towelliee boosting is just another means to supporting the company we all love and enjoy
[28:36:42] Gendread77: not like Blizz lets u boost to T2 / T3 fully geared toons.. you have a bit better then 60 dung gear.
[28:36:50] Chiraakitteh: 'People' should just stick to their own business, boosting just skips the part where you have great gear to start off in TBC LUL
[28:37:00] goretera: mage players have been getting paid to boost people since like phase 2. whats the difference
[28:37:00] Spintaru: *raises skull up* To Boost.. or not to Boost... that is the question....
[28:37:01] Molvonos: @Gendread77 lol, no  you don't.  Boostie gear is hot garbage.
[28:37:10] perssonsz: should have been a little bit cheaper for the dark portal pass
[28:37:16] Gendread77: its not really.
[28:37:20] perssonsz: but if you compare to the retail prize its actually fine
[28:37:21] TheUnknowing: its actually not better than any 60 gear @Gendread77 its fairly comparable to like 45-50 gear
[28:37:26] Piekatsjoe: lvl 48 50 gear is better then the gear u get from boost
[28:37:37] TheItalianStallion321: boosted gear still makes you farm for more gear lol
[28:37:47] Chiraakitteh: Druids end up with half and half intellect and agility gear, can’t heal or dps with that at all
[28:37:48] Wulfgrym: i boosted 2 toons on 2 accounts  no regrets
[28:37:52] Gendread77: again ive boosted twice. looked at 90% of the gear you can buy from the AH and most of it is not better. yes some blues that are 100s of gold are better but not a lot.
[28:37:57] Janigiv: lula what did u main in TBC?
[28:38:06] dubvhero75: does your character from classic move over the TBC?
[28:38:10] Gendread77: even some of STRAT scholo , gear isnt THAT much better lol.
[28:38:48] perssonsz: you can also copy your character
[28:38:51] Gendread77: now with TBC live, boosting isnt a huge issues, do a few quest and can get much better gear.
[28:38:55] GUNNAROptiks: I actually did the same thing. Scholo into Strat, it was painful
[28:40:00] akia03: boosted chars started gearing in zf to replace boosted gear

[28:40:26] SavageCheez: @MissMiaMari same here
[28:40:38] Dragoncaller: What i find funny that many of those that were against boosting, were being boosted in dungeons or doing the boosting.
