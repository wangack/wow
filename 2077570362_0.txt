[0:21:05] ThousandEyesAnd1: mtm charge
[0:21:11] ThousandEyesAnd1: month to month
[0:21:12] Camastad: Smadge you can't move out it's against the lease
[0:21:32] z3r0f14m3: Yeah they can Month to Month you if you dont give them the notice required by the lease, I got hit by a 60 day one at one point
[0:21:35] terrabeth: it would go month to month
[0:22:10] stoops17: end of march lease, he wanted a firm decision before february
[0:22:37] z3r0f14m3: Yeah, they can do that, it depends on what your lease says
[0:22:49] z3r0f14m3: it can automatically convert, its just minimum 1 year
[0:22:51] xxtheowl: that what my apartment I was in did
[0:22:56] ThousandEyesAnd1: yes need notice 2 months before end of lease with intention
[0:23:09] ThousandEyesAnd1: depends on lease
[0:23:10] stoops17: it's a weird quirk of renting, logically, without saying you are extending, a lease would just end, but they want to know if they have to prep a property

[0:23:52] ThousandEyesAnd1: they want to be able to show your property
[0:24:03] stoops17: welcome to the rent trap
[0:24:04] articpuffin: Yeah its more for them to put it on the market and have someone lined up
[0:24:22] articpuffin: if you didnt stay
[0:25:10] z3r0f14m3: yours if it says so in the lease
[0:25:14] ThousandEyesAnd1: read your lease
[0:25:36] SamsonOption: small claims
[0:25:43] MalsNotBad: Having seen the discord pics, I wonder if hello fresh would let you do the ad in full Hooker get up and voice...
[0:25:44] stoops17: my landlord asks me before the notice deadline, so he knows what he has to prepare for
[0:25:51] xxtheowl: the apartment asked us if we were renewing our lease per their changes of upping the price within like a month of it being up but then said oh btw id you don’t renew it’s breaking the lease by not telling us 3 months in advance so we’re gonna fine you X amount of money ??????
[0:26:32] stoops17: um hooker voice was requested last night, you just glossed over it
[0:26:34] ThousandEyesAnd1: month to month chargers on top of rent increase hurt me recently
[0:27:10] stoops17: ugh my rent has gone up every year last 6 years, my pay has gone up once sadge
[0:28:00] MalsNotBad: I haven't spoken to my landlord in 3 years outside of add £20 to standing order for next years rent

[0:28:44] ThousandEyesAnd1: my property manager charges $125 month to month post lease and rent went up $150 at the same time
[0:29:49] Camastad: no contract
[0:29:56] stoops17: you signed a year lease, you can rent month to month
[0:30:18] stoops17: it's for if you have a gap to a new place or selling/buying a house
[0:30:19] terrabeth: month to month is generally a bad deal
[0:30:46] articpuffin: I had to do month to month for 2 months till my house was ready
[0:30:55] z3r0f14m3: its generally only a thing after a lease ends
[0:31:06] ThousandEyesAnd1: i signed a 12 month lease but didn’t give move out notice so months 13 and 14 were month to month
[0:31:36] xxtheowl: few years ago my landlord sold the house we lived in and didn’t tell us until the new owner showed up to the house and said he bought this house and is giving us 30 days to get out. that was so stressful trying to find a place
[0:33:14] xxtheowl: hush big funny guy
[0:33:27] MalsNotBad: Noticed you did say no to Hooker fresh
[0:33:34] MalsNotBad: Didn't

[2:36:35] z3r0f14m3: the story is pretty great, each xpac gets better and better
[2:36:54] Lurks_like_Gaston: I run ff14 music in the background for a lot of things

[2:37:34] Kaia_32: before i started playing WoW every time i got an itch for an MMO my friend would just say just play wow
[2:38:06] AzureMarquis: WoW's best points are always the combat
[2:38:15] AzureMarquis: I think FF14 beats it in raid design music and story
[2:38:16] Lurks_like_Gaston: My friends always told me  "DONT DO IT BRO ITS NO WORHT IT BRO" and thus I never played wow mbroW
[2:38:37] Camastad: good friends tbh

[2:39:50] AzureMarquis: And then Soken the music guy was like "who are you guys I've never heard of you in my life" and Power man 5000 dropped down
[2:39:56] AzureMarquis: FF14 combat is great at max level
[2:40:08] AzureMarquis: FF14 combat at leveling sucks ass
[2:40:12] ZombFeed: ff14 has just that little bit of clunk to it
[2:40:15] ZombFeed: compared to wow
[2:40:30] AzureMarquis: yeah WoW always does combat great
[2:40:34] ZombFeed: there is
[2:40:37] ZombFeed: not as big as wow tho
[2:40:37] z3r0f14m3: there certainly is
[2:40:41] AzureMarquis: There is
[2:40:46] AzureMarquis: but Raids usually last a day-2
[2:40:49] TheCatzM3ow: people sitll do expeditions?
[2:40:52] AzureMarquis: because it's balanced
[2:41:12] AzureMarquis: Raids don't last a month + because FF14 has good gearing system and is usually ballanced
[2:41:13] ZombFeed: well ffxiv raids are much smaller as well
[2:41:18] TheCatzM3ow: fair
[2:41:23] z3r0f14m3: there was a big controversy cause addons are banned and one of the world firsts was essentially cheated
[2:41:33] AzureMarquis: Yeah they were using a zoom hack
[2:41:36] AzureMarquis: to get more vision lol
[2:41:44] AzureMarquis: and SE banned them and their FC members
[2:42:04] ZombFeed: ffxiv is great in that ud ont need any external tools/addons (and u cant really use em since thats tos)
[2:42:19] GreenConure: i'm getting like 2 pets a run
[2:42:23] GreenConure: the drop rate is so high
[2:43:08] ZombFeed: ffxiv doesnt have m+ equivalent, so i always drop off after i beat the .0 patch
[2:43:09] z3r0f14m3: one huge QOL is swapping classes just by swapping gearsets, no need for diff characters
[2:43:11] zara1024: I can't bear to delete pets 😭 so I have a ton sitting on a bank alt that I can't sell or do anything else with
[2:43:12] GreenConure: only 3.4m
[2:43:14] TheCatzM3ow: nice

[2:44:36] dankNstein_: was that you asking someone how much a 20  was?
[2:44:43] dankNstein_: because those probably dont sell fast KEKW
[2:44:51] ZombFeed: well ffxiv has content locking, so if ur behind u ahve a lot to catch up with
[2:45:03] GreenConure: we were asking to see the prices
[2:45:05] dankNstein_: like asking a seller in trade chat spamming
[2:45:08] dankNstein_: green
[2:45:11] GreenConure: cause we were gonna try to sell
[2:45:18] ZombFeed: ive gotten fucked by not playing every patch and having to catch up in ff14
[2:45:20] z3r0f14m3: Sometime you should watch a world first prog video Moose, the mechanics get crazy
[2:45:32] AzureMarquis: What do you get from AOTC?
[2:45:47] ZombFeed: mount
[2:46:13] AzureMarquis: what mount?
[2:46:15] GreenConure: mount appearance
[2:46:28] dankNstein_: proto
[2:46:34] GreenConure: this one but shadowflame
[2:46:37] GreenConure: this is the rare drop one
[2:46:41] z3r0f14m3: the only thing I think that sucks about the raids is they are pretty much all static room/arenas. Wow is clearly way ahead in that design
[2:46:44] AzureMarquis: is it the chicken or no
[2:46:45] dankNstein_: i have the orange one too
[2:46:51] dankNstein_: the chicken is for mythic
[2:46:58] AzureMarquis: cringe
[2:47:05] zara1024: well that's the rare drop, not the aotc tint lol
[2:47:28] dankNstein_: i wish i had last seasons rare drop
[2:47:43] dankNstein_: ima farm fated aberrus every week for it
[2:48:12] zara1024: I didn't get last season's rare, but I did get the raszageth skin in season 1 which I just LOVE
[2:48:34] dankNstein_: i didnt get raz or sark skin but i got fyrakks
[2:48:44] dankNstein_: sark is my fav one
[2:49:12] zara1024: raz was my favourite by far so I'm super glad I got that one
[2:51:43] brittanany_: mbroWiggle mbroWiggle
[2:52:13] brittanany_: mbroCozy af boi
[2:53:24] stoops17: what box should you buy? well Hello Fresh of course!
[2:54:39] zara1024: I wish the game kept track of Skadi kills, I'm sure I'm well over 500 by now but my Rarity only goes back to last october
[2:55:15] zara1024: I'm ~320 on Rarity and I farmed it for years before
[2:55:25] CrimmyG: Can I propose a 420,420k channel point redeem for Weed Tax, so I can spend all of my points?
[2:55:33] dankNstein_: good bit
[2:55:33] zara1024: I wish it was a bit KEKW

[3:00:01] RY3GUY: Mals sold some island drop for 400k the other day it's wild
[3:00:03] zara1024: I have never been able to sell a mog for any kind of worthwhile money, maybe it's just my server
[3:00:20] LetsGoPolice: ladyhopeHey mbroHey
[3:00:29] Bowes0: Hey Jimmy how's it goin
[3:00:34] brittanany_: MooseWave hey Jimmy
[3:00:41] LetsGoPolice: island boy today?
[3:01:18] itsbubbzi: I think the highest I've sold was BoP to mals for like 35k
[3:01:30] LetsGoPolice: islands were cool content. really wish they didnt turn it into an azerite grind that it burned people out
[3:01:55] itsbubbzi: Mals got that crafter money
[3:02:29] LetsGoPolice: do you have the 1200 bird mount?
[3:04:09] LetsGoPolice: flavor pocket experiment = mbroPain
[3:04:13] dankNstein_: lariat crafters made bank
[3:04:15] zara1024: Risen Mare is so good that's the only island expedition mount I really wanted and I still don't have it
[3:04:33] LetsGoPolice: nah, they sell too slow
[3:04:46] dankNstein_: you just get so many of them
[3:04:50] itsbubbzi: Flavor pockets sitting  at 50k rn and I'm sitting here with 2k and just feasts in my bag
[3:04:54] dankNstein_: ive gotten like 7 flavor pockets in the past 2 weeks
[3:05:07] dankNstein_: i have all my 60+ toons out there
[3:05:11] RY3GUY: Should save flavor for next season
[3:05:21] GreenConure: same thing is happening to me
[3:05:23] RY3GUY: Get those returning players
[3:05:31] itsbubbzi: I've had 1 drop ever
[3:06:36] LetsGoPolice: wait, you;re the 10 million rocket seller?
[3:07:15] LetsGoPolice: thought I saw you listed it
[3:07:22] AzureMarquis: Sucks for him
[3:07:36] dankNstein_: i dont have a rocket
[3:07:47] dankNstein_: i regret not buying tons of duped spectral tigers in mop though
[3:07:52] AzureMarquis: just need magic rooster next
[3:08:01] dankNstein_: i thought they would actually delete them
[3:08:06] LetsGoPolice: I've been debating buying a spectral tiger card but am worried they are going to put it for Twitch drops
[3:08:08] dankNstein_: but i shoulda known they wouldnt do shit
[3:08:17] AzureMarquis: @LetsGoPolice it's 100% happening
[3:08:26] dankNstein_: doubt it happens
[3:08:28] AzureMarquis: I'd wait for the rapid fire expansions and see
[3:08:36] AzureMarquis: idk man nobody thought any of the TCG shit was coming
[3:08:40] itsbubbzi: Just give me the jester set for twitch drop pls
[3:08:43] AzureMarquis: then they did like 4 tcg shits so
[3:08:48] dankNstein_: nah i knew some of the shit was going to happen eventually
[3:08:55] AzureMarquis: @itsbubbzi should've played when it was out L + FOMO
[3:08:58] dankNstein_: but i doubt the spectral tiger / blizzard bear rarity of stuff will
[3:09:08] itsbubbzi: I started wow right after it left dawg
[3:09:13] AzureMarquis: Blizz bear is diff than spectral tiger
[3:09:26] JCross133: mbroChomp
[3:11:11] LetsGoPolice: watch them put the blizzard bear on microsoft game pass KEKL
[3:11:27] AzureMarquis: Yeah maybe
[3:11:54] Anhellzer: or make the flag as microsoft logo
[3:11:56] Anhellzer: xD
[3:12:42] stoops17: AFK Victory!
[3:12:49] Lurks_like_Gaston: Jobs done Clap
[3:12:57] AzureMarquis: WoW moose really did it
[3:13:02] dankNstein_: i honestly only see them putting the cheaper stuff in the trading post

[3:13:41] dankNstein_: then recoloring a bunch of shit
[3:14:17] dankNstein_: like how they added a fomo vendor in front of the BMAH in valdrakken and are releasing recolor weapons in the next trading post KEKW
[3:15:39] AzureMarquis: That's why i sent you the FF14 music
[3:15:41] AzureMarquis: to listen to it

[3:16:04] stoops17: mbroCozy
[3:16:13] dankNstein_: kinda glad i didnt spent 300k on the polearm and 1h sword from the panda npc now
[3:16:28] GreenConure: CAUGHT
[3:16:34] itsbubbzi: I hyper extended my hamstring and walking at work is not fun
[3:17:02] AzureMarquis: They should remove M+ and put in rewarding end game stuff vs repeat cycle farms
[3:17:12] LetsGoPolice: M+ is great
[3:17:19] dankNstein_: L take
[3:17:31] dankNstein_: they are adding the delves
[3:17:38] ZombFeed: m+ is great because u can push difficulty and challenge urself
[3:17:41] AzureMarquis: Yeah I think it needs more than just "this is bis rng gear"
[3:17:44] GreenConure: i would just quit if they removed m+ tbh
[3:17:53] ZombFeed: the reward system sucks, but m+ itself is fine
[3:17:56] AzureMarquis: Devls are open world dungeons
[3:18:05] AzureMarquis: Delves*
[3:18:18] ZombFeed: affixes need a rework for sure
[3:18:26] AzureMarquis: I think if M+ gave tokens it would be better.

[3:18:49] RY3GUY: Make mythic plus dungeons drop like 500 gold pls god
[3:18:55] RY3GUY: I make no gold
[3:19:03] AzureMarquis: Food lasting through wipes would be nice
[3:19:11] AzureMarquis: FF14 has that
[3:19:12] dankNstein_: pay 40k for a flavor pocket
[3:19:14] dankNstein_: poor
[3:19:21] AzureMarquis: Why do i need an item
[3:19:29] AzureMarquis: to do something that should be fucking base line??????
[3:19:42] AzureMarquis: Pots already do why not food
[3:19:49] masterarkaine: 40k? i paid 58k a pieve for the 3 character i have with one atm
[3:19:54] Vikinick: flavor packet isn't even an embellishment
[3:20:07] GreenConure: i still dont have a flavor pocket on my dh
[3:20:23] dankNstein_: thats like such a miniscule thing to complain about too
[3:20:30] AzureMarquis: WoW to me sucks if you don't have a raid group because if you aren't doing M+ or raids there isn't much for you
[3:20:30] dankNstein_: id rather them do something like the vendor for raid buffs
[3:20:45] LetsGoPolice: well at least you dont need stupid prism items to transmog your gear
[3:20:46] dankNstein_: like how they have for follower dungeons
[3:21:01] zara1024: @AzureMarquis mogs, mounts, archaeology, pet battles, there's a ton of stuff for casuals too
[3:21:12] AzureMarquis: @LetsGoPolice so true the 10gil prism items kill it man
[3:21:16] ZombFeed: @AzureMarquis ill say the same for ffxiv
[3:21:18] AzureMarquis: You only need gold to xmog your gear
[3:21:21] TPLivewire: Surely
[3:21:29] ZombFeed: theres a lot u can do not end game related in both games
[3:21:33] AzureMarquis: @ZombFeed FF14 has a lot of solo oriented content
[3:21:38] LetsGoPolice: @AzureMarquis same logic as "why do i need an item" for not losing food buff between deaths
[3:21:48] ZombFeed: azure ive played ffxiv, u dont needa tell me anything
[3:21:57] masterarkaine: I just got done with the BFA cloak quests, that would had been ass in bfa. So much travel
[3:21:58] zara1024: @AzureMarquis it's an "mmo" lol I think it's fair for the best content to require a group
[3:22:03] AzureMarquis: Also FF14 doesn't remove stuff so shruggers
[3:22:17] ZombFeed: games different, shrug
[3:22:21] AzureMarquis: I can go back and get relic weapons from ARR, I can't go back and get my mage tower weapon skin
[3:22:29] AzureMarquis: I want my mage tower weapons dammit
[3:22:33] TPLivewire: Dude, you need to play some FFXIV
[3:22:34] AzureMarquis: DESKCHAN
[3:22:36] AzureMarquis: bring em back
[3:22:37] dankNstein_: its not gonna make anyone play it KEKW
[3:22:49] GreenConure: never giving up my fire glaives
[3:22:56] GreenConure: best mage tower appearance
[3:22:56] AzureMarquis: it's fucking harder now
[3:22:58] dankNstein_: ya im happy with my titles ppl cant get
[3:22:58] AzureMarquis: lol
[3:22:59] zara1024: I played FF14 for like 2 weeks back in 2019, it was sooo dull
[3:23:06] dankNstein_: mage towers are fucking easy as piss now
[3:23:08] AzureMarquis: It's harder now than it was then
[3:23:09] dankNstein_: lmao
[3:23:11] ZombFeed: being rewarded for doing current content is nice
[3:23:24] ZombFeed: missing out on things is fine
[3:23:44] dankNstein_: i dont think any mage tower currently is difficult
[3:23:53] AzureMarquis: just bring em back with a recollor
[3:24:00] AzureMarquis: the new mage tower is harder than it was in legion
[3:24:07] dankNstein_: na
[3:24:09] AzureMarquis: because you require so much legion gear vs DF gear
[3:24:29] dankNstein_: i actually went back and just did a bunch of mage towers on lvl 60s in greens
[3:24:34] dankNstein_: KEKW
[3:24:35] GreenConure: i did it in all df gear and was it easy
[3:24:51] AzureMarquis: @GreenConure last time I tried was in Shadowlands so could be a bit easier
[3:24:52] LetsGoPolice: I still think its dumb the gatekeep older elite PVP appearances
[3:24:57] AzureMarquis: I mean I had the spirit of competition
[3:25:02] dankNstein_: ya im happy ppl cant get my arena master title anymore
[3:25:03] AzureMarquis: yet people could get that so shruggers
[3:25:07] GreenConure: GreenConure subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 24 months! 
[3:25:13] dankNstein_: or champion of ulduar etc
[3:25:21] skypizza1: not getting longboi is my greatest wow regret
[3:25:30] dankNstein_: ya longboi is everyones biggest regret
[3:25:42] itsbubbzi: Well like for me I've only been playing for a year so there's things I will never see
[3:25:54] masterarkaine: i missed only a tiny amount of stuff though. Challenge modes in mop were very stict on time where people either were gods or you failed everytime
[3:25:56] AzureMarquis: Playing wow was my greatest wow regret KEKW
[3:25:57] dankNstein_: i thought they would just keep making them
[3:26:03] dankNstein_: so i never bought it
[3:26:16] GreenConure: rarity says it's only 1/100
[3:26:18] zara1024: I only saved 4.2 million by the time they removed longboi ladyhopeCry
[3:26:21] GreenConure: idk if i believe it
[3:26:43] Fleh: Typing while doing expeditions...
[3:27:12] AzureMarquis: I mean if they even did time walking of former expacs they should bring some shit back for them
[3:27:36] RY3GUY: I thought the boxes are the best way for mounts
[3:27:38] LetsGoPolice: timerunning, yeah
[3:27:42] GreenConure: Prayge
[3:27:44] LetsGoPolice: the tinfoil hat theory
[3:27:50] LetsGoPolice: yeah its on the calendar
[3:27:52] LetsGoPolice: check it
[3:27:52] GreenConure: time to send the hunters to the belt mines
[3:27:55] dankNstein_: ya ppl were also tinfoil challenge mode type stuff coming back
[3:28:05] Fleh: Haven't been able to play all day.  Got food poisoning and been dying.
[3:28:08] foot_boot: that was from the korkron war wolf datamine right?
[3:28:11] LetsGoPolice: correct

[3:28:44] AzureMarquis: Idk theres two sides, new players being told "nope sucks for you"
[3:28:48] AzureMarquis: but that's just fomo I guess
[3:28:56] Fleh: Fomo sucks
[3:28:57] AzureMarquis: Didn't play since vanilla no ashbringer
[3:29:00] AzureMarquis: Rip sucks a dick
[3:29:12] LetsGoPolice: weapons were draenor
[3:29:30] dankNstein_: weps were wod, armor sets and phoenix mount was mop
[3:29:34] AzureMarquis: WoW also has so many items that often times the avg player wouldn't be able to tell the diff
[3:29:43] dankNstein_: yea
[3:29:44] dankNstein_: same
[3:29:46] LetsGoPolice: I have the mounts and the paladin set from MoP
[3:29:55] dankNstein_: i just didnt care for anything like that at the time and regret it
[3:30:02] dankNstein_: cuz my closest friends actually did them and sold them
[3:30:10] dankNstein_: and i coulda did them easily
[3:30:16] AzureMarquis: I just think removal of content is the worst
[3:30:21] itsbubbzi: I'm trying to get the heart of fear set on my warlock rn
[3:30:32] zara1024: @dankNstein_ yeah same
[3:30:32] LetsGoPolice: the coolest thing about the MoP sets is that when you cast a spell there's a unique animation/glow on the armor
[3:30:41] foot_boot: if they're making Classic cata, there's no way they're not making MoP too
[3:30:42] dankNstein_: all i wanted to do in mop was wpvp on timeless isle or sit in town and queue 3s
[3:30:56] foot_boot: I would play MoP again 100%
[3:31:14] dankNstein_: i didnt even make my cape in mop
[3:31:22] dankNstein_: cuz all i did was pvp
[3:31:24] AzureMarquis: That fucking cape
[3:32:10] itsbubbzi: I want to do pvp but I've never touched shuffle
[3:32:14] AzureMarquis: wheres the challenge mode set
[3:32:17] AzureMarquis: the mop one
[3:32:26] AzureMarquis: hehe
[3:32:31] foot_boot: i dont think it shows up if its not obtainable
[3:32:36] AzureMarquis: I play too many different classes
[3:32:53] AzureMarquis: if I was a 1 class andy I'd probably have more shit for that class
[3:34:00] AzureMarquis: variety is the spice of life for me
[3:34:13] AzureMarquis: how so
[3:34:21] AzureMarquis: gonna account wide removed content?
[3:34:25] dankNstein_: ya i cant wait for warbands
[3:34:48] foot_boot: its about god damn time
[3:35:23] AzureMarquis: Challenge mode, mage tower, Vanilla wow PVP gear, T2
[3:35:26] ZombFeed: the systems era was not good
[3:35:34] AzureMarquis: yeah the systems era was not good
[3:35:36] ZombFeed: legion/bfa/sl has so many expansion only systems
[3:35:44] dankNstein_: ya
[3:35:50] zara1024: waiting patiently to hear how FF14 actually did warbands years ago and better mbroW
[3:35:52] dankNstein_: i can mog vanilla pvp gear rn
[3:35:57] dankNstein_: just get 2k or something in rbgs

[3:36:02] ZombFeed: pvp in ffxiv is dogshit
[3:36:04] AzureMarquis: naxx shit
[3:36:04] foot_boot: Imagine if they did it like PoE and kept all the systems they implemented going forward
[3:36:12] dankNstein_: you can craft that
[3:36:13] GreenConure: you can get that now
[3:36:18] dankNstein_: bruh...
[3:36:18] masterarkaine: I started with a Warrior in late Vanilla. Then my Hunter came mid BC and been my main ever since. Played a lot of plate in Cata and MoP, added casters in Legion, but Hunter is always my first to everything
[3:36:25] GreenConure: they redid a whole naxx thing
[3:36:28] GreenConure: there's a mount there too
[3:37:00] AzureMarquis: Oh nice, I haven't been playing wow because it's not a worthwhile time investment since it's sunsetting DF
[3:37:01] masterarkaine: super OG vanilla Naxx?
[3:37:29] AzureMarquis: If War Within doesn't launch near Dawntrial I'll play that for first raid at least
[3:38:37] AzureMarquis: GOLD
[3:38:47] AzureMarquis: How many wow tokens
[3:38:50] AzureMarquis: 20$ EZ
[3:39:01] AzureMarquis: wtf
[3:39:04] AzureMarquis: Not worth it
[3:39:11] thedirtyderk: pretty much around 3mil
[3:39:19] AzureMarquis: well you have to play the game to get it
[3:39:23] AzureMarquis: and I refuse to do that lol
[3:39:54] foot_boot: I am permanently burnt out on farming gold after grinding for long boi
[3:40:03] AzureMarquis: or a warlock
[3:40:16] masterarkaine: god t3 war late was amazing
[3:40:32] GreenConure: warrior pieces were near gold cap each beforehand iirc
[3:41:21] AzureMarquis: I got Adhd brain, I'll grind a game for a month then get burnt on it
[3:41:38] AzureMarquis: and not come back for a year. I used to love playing WoW til it felt like the story just so fucked
[3:41:46] masterarkaine: i have played wow since 2006, dont even know what gold cap is for this game
[3:41:46] itsbubbzi: Just grind game and watch Netflix in the other monitor
[3:41:50] foot_boot: weirdly one of my biggest gold makers was arcane crystals. I think it was around the time they introduced thunderfury tmog
[3:42:09] LetsGoPolice: that blue firelands plate sells like hotcakes
[3:42:12] AzureMarquis: that + last two guilds I raided with were either elitist or racist sadly.
[3:42:33] GreenConure: god i have to do superblooms after this
[3:42:38] GreenConure: why
[3:42:39] AzureMarquis: I still remember my GM yelling at his wife for not doing good damage and kicking her
[3:42:41] AzureMarquis: that shit was funny
[3:42:47] LetsGoPolice: you got the axe on your paladin?
[3:42:53] GreenConure: yeah
[3:42:55] GreenConure: got it from lfr
[3:42:59] LetsGoPolice: damn you...but grats

[5:18:11] zara1024: mechanically the adds are all the same, just with reskinned abilities. like I'm positive you get a bleed on the archer and the axe thrower, it just has a different name
[5:18:54] generic_sam: vibePls
[5:19:11] dankNstein_: @zara1024 yoda said the archers on horde dont cast the bleed if someone is in melee but on alli they still cast it
