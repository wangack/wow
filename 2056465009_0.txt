[2:06:26] Wizardstrangler: hunters love small groups because the way they play matters
[2:06:35] Wizardstrangler: in a 40 man they just exist and give auras
[2:06:39] Wizardstrangler: and pull shit
[2:06:51] Wizardstrangler: this can be applied to many specs/classes
[2:06:51] ashram_x: 10m feels like a glorified UBRS run, which is fun - but it ain't no raid imo
[2:06:56] Wizardstrangler: but 40 man hit different
[2:07:04] Terrozer: like only having 1 raid just sucks, the awesome part of classic, even up to wrath, is how u get gear from last raid and take it to the next
[2:07:09] Wizardstrangler: yeah some feel like small raids just feels like a long dungeon
[2:07:11] Wizardstrangler: and i get that too
[2:07:37] Terrozer: yeah
[2:08:25] Terrozer: like im gonna play, and have fun, but i think its gonna feel the same at 40 as 25, classes will feel a bit better, and we get mounts and thats it
[2:08:31] omegakory: i expected hard version of bfd that would require 20
[2:09:24] Terrozer: u need options
