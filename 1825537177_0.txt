[2:20:18] PieceOfPanic: @Molvonos I just know there's gonna be more like that down the line. And I'm gonna miss out on it, because I have other things to attend to as well. I can't play the game in my own pace.

[2:21:29] Molvonos: @PieceOfPanic But you can play at your own pace, as long as your own pace coincides with a season.  It's gonna be the same as D3 in that regard.  But almost every single online game has what you call 'FOMO' culture or what have you.

[2:22:15] PieceOfPanic: That's a completely fair opinion
[2:22:23] Molvonos: Sounds like cutting off your nose to spite your face tbh.  You enjoy playing D4, play D4.  Its not like the extra stuff gives any player power.
[2:22:32] Rottencoarse: @Towelliee  i think blizz has given an empty check for diablo 4 marketing that's what i feel
[2:22:38] PieceOfPanic: @jkitchin75 yee, I can. I could also just play diablo 2, where nothing is behind either a paywall nor a fomo wall.
[2:23:03] PieceOfPanic: @Molvonos no no, I enjoy Diablo 2.
[2:23:08] RagingPunk: and that shake lol
[2:23:12] neftario105: cool
[2:23:17] Molvonos: Then what's the issue?
[2:23:24] VarlBGem: I still haven't finished D3 yet.
[2:23:29] neftario105: What u going to main on D4 @Towelliee ?
[2:23:33] Rottencoarse: @Towelliee  the butcher shake is meh for me XD
[2:23:33] Molvonos: Play the game you wanna play, no reason to die on a hill you have no stake in.
[2:23:38] jkitchin75: @PieceOfPanic so what hell are you going on about
[2:23:57] RagingPunk: i know right lol
[2:24:04] Molvonos: Its a pickled meat smoothie from Shadowlands.
[2:24:05] abracka_: it sounds so disgusting
[2:24:06] Molvonos: Bet
[2:24:16] PieceOfPanic: owh
[2:24:20] Rottencoarse: @Towelliee  it might be a kfc deal

[2:24:59] PieceOfPanic: @jkitchin75 Because it's unfortunate, when u've looked forward to something for a lot of years. THen realizing u can't have the full experience due to FOMO

[2:25:21] Molvonos: @PieceOfPanic My dude, do you play *any* games that aren't 20 years old then?  jesus.
[2:25:35] neftario105: @Towelliee going to main a Necromancer
[2:25:49] Rottencoarse: i'll wait for june 2 to play (i live in EU) dont want to wait for queues
[2:25:49] PieceOfPanic: @Molvonos Never mind man. U think what you want :)
[2:25:54] ForgottnHero21: not for 1 or 2
[2:25:57] Rottencoarse: @Towelliee  yeah there will be no leaderboards
[2:26:01] jkitchin75: @PieceOfPanic your not missing anything from the core game end of

[2:26:31] zeeAbe: If it is possible, 3rd party leaderboards will appear
[2:26:32] neftario105: @jkitchin75 is retail any good?
[2:26:43] Molvonos: They might do the same leaderboard system that they do with the mythic raiders?
[2:26:47] PieceOfPanic: @jkitchin75 ur not though. One person gets a reward for completing something, the other doesn't.
[2:26:51] Rottencoarse: well i'm gonna check maxroll for builds ^^
[2:26:53] jkitchin75: @neftario105 yes
[2:27:09] neftario105: @jkitchin75 try classic
[2:27:39] jkitchin75: @PieceOfPanic sorry but thats a you thing you need help
[2:27:46] jkitchin75: @neftario105 why
[2:27:47] PieceOfPanic: Diablo has had tons of mods in the past, but never allowed them online
[2:27:51] neftario105: is good to but slower
[2:27:56] Alsparq: yolomouse was the only one that didnt seem to piss them off
[2:27:59] PieceOfPanic: @jkitchin75 THat's ur judgement :)
[2:28:09] neftario105: @jkitchin75 ull like it is good
[2:28:13] Ertra: third party stuff in diablo has always been a big nono
[2:28:42] Alsparq: it was a curser addon to make your mouse easier to find
[2:28:43] VarlBGem: you only live once, Mouse! lol
[2:28:46] PieceOfPanic: @jkitchin75 I'm not gonna go into the debate based on feelings. That's factual, one gets a reward the other doesn't. That's not a "me problem"
[2:28:47] jkitchin75: @neftario105 sorry classic sucks
[2:29:47] PieceOfPanic: It makes sense with an ARPG

[2:29:56] jkitchin75: @PieceOfPanic it is if the thing thay get means nothing but a xmog you so need help
[2:30:01] IggiePuff: IggiePuff subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 73 months, currently on a 1 month streak!

[2:30:10] NewWorldReign: What do you think about WoW making hardcore official, could they done it earlier?
[2:30:19] ArcaneSyntax: Diablo immortal felt more like an MMO than D4
[2:30:22] PieceOfPanic: Because there's gonna happen SO much on the screen constantly. More than 12 people would be so much on ur screen all the time.
[2:30:46] PieceOfPanic: @jkitchin75 Fact of the matter is. These 2 people paid the same thing, and get 2 different products.
[2:31:03] Molvonos: The downside to 80 people on the same screen during that one world boss meant the boss never died.
[2:31:06] NewWorldReign: @Towelliee I want to see like a 5 man dungeon or something in D4, would make sense.
[2:31:10] Molvonos: Because people kept messing up mechanics.
[2:31:40] zettiz: they said they wanted to emphasize the feeling of beeing alone in D4
[2:32:09] neftario105: Diablo have lfg for dungeons?

[2:32:49] jkitchin75: @PieceOfPanic but get the same game a tmog does not change the base game
[2:33:02] NewWorldReign: @Towelliee Did you beat the boss on D4 Beta?
[2:33:06] kelticc: they are gonna implement a type of "Fortnite" game
[2:33:26] Molvonos: I actually died to the butcher as my necro.  Killed him five times as my sorc.  I was kinda shocked tbh
[2:33:42] PieceOfPanic: @jkitchin75 Ur ignoring the fact, that people do the same thing and get different outcomes. Pay the same thing, for the same product. Yet their different.
[2:34:02] AvoxHelio: AvoxHelio subscribed with Prime. 
[2:34:07] Armdel: ATC ✊
[2:34:42] PieceOfPanic: @jkitchin75 Anyway, i'm not gonna discuss more with you. Ur allowed to ur opinion.
[2:34:45] NewWorldReign: What gameplay do you prefer on Diablo, the story mode or adventure mode?
[2:34:52] PieceOfPanic: As is all
[2:34:55] EasilyZeroed: what about for each death (after a certain level) on the next character you make you have a perm 1%xp boost or just get an EX boost until the level you died at?
[2:35:03] TheUnknowing: Man I was so sad I couldnt do the server slam, was in the hospital the entire time cause i had back surgery the day it started lol
[2:35:16] jkitchin75: @PieceOfPanic there not its still the same game but there is no point with you cos you missed a tmog or mount

[3:29:20] PieceOfPanic: And Blizzard also usually keep an eye on leading teams, wether they livestreams or not.
[3:29:21] Holysal: @crixus250x they did
[3:29:23] Wulfgrym: yep fuck the viewers, echo has done it too, so tough shit.
[3:29:32] wEiRdO_dUdE: Max doing that was the play of the race, that's true
[3:29:33] theDirtyon3: LMAO
[3:29:52] PieceOfPanic: Yea. there's nothing to it. Liquid won this round.
[3:29:55] theDirtyon3: @crixus250x no they did not Liquid got to Sark first
[3:30:00] c0mmander_starscream: these kids these days
[3:30:01] crixus250x: @crixus250x Ya i thought so i was watching off an on with work

[3:30:52] mavericks312: Max said prepare for more of that on final bosses
[3:30:58] CMack_72: sour grapes.  we have the same discussion every WF race.  bored
[3:31:02] Fugazi811: but you lost
[3:31:04] Wulfgrym: i love watching gingi crying that retail is meant to be more competitive
[3:31:12] wEiRdO_dUdE: If it works they gotta do it
[3:31:21] c0mmander_starscream: their esports honor cant take the loss under esports bushido code
[3:31:26] PieceOfPanic: It's the same it's always been, nothing new. Now it's just all going on, on social platform in front of a live audience.
[3:31:33] abracka_: i mean, echo thinking they were in the lead with a 25% attempt, then liquid just going online at 6 AM with a 14% attempt threw echo completely off. you could see it in all the attempts for the remainder of the day
[3:31:56] mavericks312: You could tell echo strategy was see what liquid does
[3:32:00] Grandmarshal: Yooooo... Towelliee it's good to see you doing hardcore
[3:32:01] HilariousMax: You kept saying "I've NEVER seen them so SHOOK" and I could hear the salty fanbois gnashing their teeth
[3:32:29] mavericks312: Then liquid dick slapped echo with that 14% at 5am

[3:32:32] Wulfgrym: screw the viewers, liquid is running a competitive team, its about the wins.
[3:32:40] PieceOfPanic: I'm EU fan all the way though, but we got beat this round. Won the last one. That's life.
[3:33:57] wEiRdO_dUdE: It was a close race and I do expect Echo to be back in it next time
[3:34:24] PieceOfPanic: Yea, it's an unfortunate environment for competetive gaming.
[3:34:39] PieceOfPanic: Also with the amount of pre-progress needed now.
[3:34:59] Aidler: it’s a complicated situation. the race is at a crossroads. no global release is killing the race
[3:35:07] PieceOfPanic: Yea, no matter what time you start. It's gonna be shit for someone.
[3:35:12] zeeAbe: Would be harder to get sponsors for the guild that has to go like "Oh yeah btw we are going to play between midnight and 11 in the morning"
[3:35:16] Wulfgrym: yeah retail is competitive, but it looks like no longer at the expense of the majority of the rest of the playerbase.
[3:35:27] mavericks312: And we all know who wins when it’s a sprint
[3:36:00] PieceOfPanic: Agreed
[3:36:17] mavericks312: Servers taking a shit at the same time

[3:36:34] Sollice: You guys kill me. “Make it a global release” “ global release will be bad for some people because it will screw over people who get late night starts and sponsors”
[3:36:43] PhoenixAuTv: why scedule the whole game around 2 0.1 players from 2x guilds.  Huh
[3:36:52] c0mmander_starscream: "Lag"
[3:36:53] Moobot:  Check out Towelliee's YouTube channel! You can view the most recent uploaded video HERE || Liquid vs Echo in RWF youtu.be/VjvujfsYVmM
[3:37:00] nouwandhi: I think they should alternate, whatever continent loses RWF start next race 1st
[3:37:02] dracullus: I don't really want server maintenance in the middle of day
[3:37:08] PieceOfPanic: @Sollice Yea for real.. No matter how u do it, it's gonna be shit for someone.
[3:37:09] PhoenixAuTv: rwf is 2 guilds competting lets be real, fun event don't base anything in the game around them
[3:37:57] mavericks312: 100% bdg loses 3-5 dps
[3:37:58] Sollice: @pieceofpanic it really is t though. These are professional guilds. If they have to start at 11pm or 4am they should all be ready
[3:38:23] Wulfgrym: yep, i like the approach this tier, making the game fun for the playerbase, who cares how fast the RWF guilds clear the content
[3:38:39] jasperboy: Method #1 in 11.0
[3:38:41] PieceOfPanic: @Sollice And they will be. That's why it's unfortunate.

[3:39:55] mavericks312: If bdg could offer more then hugs and friendship they would be in a way better spot
[3:40:10] HilariousMax: They run away at low percent AND have a root ? Bro, skip this sht lol
[3:40:18] Aidler: @sollice of course anything will be shit for some. all I’m saying is that there needs to be a global release IF they (blizz) want a serious RWF in the future
[3:40:18] PieceOfPanic: NGL i was kinda sad, tuned in to watch the Race to world First.. Instead I was watching 2 days of M+ LUL
[3:41:38] mavericks312: Sloot said 75% of the raid group was new
[3:41:55] PieceOfPanic: @Sollice Thinking about it wether it's 4 am or 11 pm, people are ready for release. some behind others. Yet this has been dealt wtih for years by the players, not the devs.

[3:42:22] mewkittymon: I think it go to get cooking up
[3:42:29] PhoenixAuTv: what player honestly makes money in echo and limit to be honest, i have no idea but i'd guess 5 people all up? Probs still gotta work a normal job
[3:42:34] PieceOfPanic: Yea. It rickles down the system
[3:42:44] PieceOfPanic: trickles*
[3:42:59] mavericks312: 4-10 is literally the farm system for the top 3
[3:43:01] Grandmarshal: Click on it or no balls LUL
[3:43:25] Rottencoarse: @Towelliee  cant u bubble and click?
[3:43:35] Sollice: I think splits kills race more than global release. In terms of viewership. I don’t like the new setup
[3:44:15] CrusaderNero: splits and gearing up is a weird one in wow and the whole race
[3:44:22] PieceOfPanic: Even in top 1000-10000, people will absolutely skip you for an opportunity.

[3:44:29] Rottencoarse: well that's the reason pieces disbanded. Losing players every tier @Towelliee
[3:45:01] Grandmarshal: Going from wrath back into retail I'd be lost with all the new systems..
[3:45:07] jasperboy: 3 days of splits, 2,5+3 days of progress and it ended. Yeah, fuck that. Didnt even see the reset, no walls. The best thing about this race was the last 20seconds before Liquid won. KEKW
[3:45:17] jasperboy: 2,5-3*
[3:45:34] PieceOfPanic: @Sollice That's how I feel about the M+ that's killing raid race more than anything else.

[3:46:05] Molvonos: @PieceOfPanic How is M+ killing the RWF?
[3:46:20] godzillamon: What is splits
[3:46:37] PieceOfPanic: @Molvonos As a viewer, I tuned in to watch the raids. Not M+
[3:46:39] c0mmander_starscream: Confirming I'm a sweaty degenerate gamer
[3:46:48] PieceOfPanic: But again, that's the new nature of the game.

[3:46:49] jasperboy: @godzillamon Guilds splitting up their players to harvest as much gear from normal and heroic as possible before going into Mythic
[3:46:50] Flyer_753: At least these mobs have slow respawn
[3:46:57] wEiRdO_dUdE: They would have to run mythic+ for days to gear up if they couldn't do the split raids, yeah
[3:47:13] Grandmarshal: A lot of pot is always good
[3:48:44] PieceOfPanic: @wEiRdO_dUdE They did both though, both m+ and splits LUL

[3:48:47] Grandmarshal: He's elite +'surrounded by guards
[3:49:01] itswilly_g: Splits are boring to watch but necessary  because its a race to 1st kiss
[3:49:10] itswilly_g: kill*
[3:49:28] PieceOfPanic: It's the nature. That's how the game is now.
[3:49:48] jorrih: gz
[3:49:50] PieceOfPanic: U run the most effecient route of gearing. No matter what it entails.
[3:49:52] NotEnoughMana: the only thing blizz can do is make the mythic easier so they dont have to do so many splits but im not sure its a good fix LUL
[3:49:58] Sollice: Go back to heroic release one week and the. Mythic the next
[3:50:12] Sollice: That’s they way it has been for years
[3:50:14] magemaster225: time to remove mythic from live and throw it all on a tournament realm
[3:50:28] Alsparq: I lost my druid here
[3:50:31] Arascayn: @Towelliee lot of casters around him up there
[3:50:32] PieceOfPanic: Honestly, I think the full release is a good thing?
[3:50:37] Sollice: Right
[3:50:38] KaisenSiru: Splits Pog
[3:50:41] PieceOfPanic: Though, for the TOP players, it's bad.
[3:50:54] joe_g_433: But don’t they just reclear heroic week 2 again?
[3:51:05] joe_g_433: But not as much maybe?
[3:51:10] PieceOfPanic: @joeg433 Yes
[3:51:14] cbiskit89: with the new gearing system, if we go back to staggered release maybe week 2 has barely any splits. huge win for viewer
[3:51:50] Sollice: I know it’s also not a concern for blizzard but doing non stop splits for 3 or 4 days then going right in to mythic sucks. Better race if they are doing splits the week before and then let people go in to mythic week 100% defend mode
[3:51:51] twisteryz: duskwood just best after this ithink
[3:52:01] Aidler: so what are the benefits of releasing mythic together with normal and heroic for blizz. remind me what they said?

[3:52:59] PieceOfPanic: I don't mind the release at the same time.
[3:53:33] Sollice: Doing splits a week before I think also helps other guilds be more competitive for mythic week

[3:53:50] PieceOfPanic: Absolutely, it does.
[3:53:54] PhoenixAuTv: If it was actually competitive, you'd have a separate realm/server and have fixed characters etc.. that players can only use unlike live that can't get any loot and everyone in the world is on the same playing field. Thats competitve if we being real
[3:54:00] Aidler: yeah, Ion had a lot of strange views over the years
[3:54:13] PhoenixAuTv: But obviously no point blizz putting time into that
[3:54:28] joe_g_433: Someone would want to be first on live still…
[3:54:49] PhoenixAuTv: why rwf should be treated as a fun event not an actual competitve one
[3:55:13] Sollice: Who do you invite to tournament realm? Top 5 guilds? What about all of the other people are competing. Blizzard would get shit on for not being inclusive enough
[3:55:16] wEiRdO_dUdE: Reclearing would be tougher if there was a tournament realm, yep

[3:55:30] PieceOfPanic: @Sollice Good point
[3:55:39] PhoenixAuTv: 100% true
[3:55:50] Alsparq: splits will never go away, they have been around since BC/wotlk
[3:55:52] Aidler: if blizz makes tournament realms people would start a new “real” or “OG” race on the normal servers
[3:56:26] joe_g_433: @alsparq I didn’t play back then. But that’s crazy to hear
[3:56:30] PieceOfPanic: They can't win the narrative, when it comes to Race to world First.

[3:59:18] Nokterian: as a casual m+er im happy
[3:59:40] PhoenixAuTv: This expac is the greatest one, only one more thing to add, those 10.1 class weapons datamined. Give me that new mage tower. I'm on huge copium hoping that its a new solo challege mode for gear
[3:59:42] PieceOfPanic: I'm gonna say it. There's never gonna be a raid like HFC again, and I'm gonna miss it!

[4:12:51] PieceOfPanic: U mean Nitro?
[4:12:51] wEiRdO_dUdE: Discord has been doing more monetization in the past years
[4:12:53] DunzoCD: more than the nitro?
[4:13:00] Pups_Gersky: They have Nitro
[4:13:13] Aidler: everything will have subs sooner or later
[4:13:22] kashmara: 10 bucks a month for nitro is already kinda yikes
[4:13:29] PhoenixAuTv: biggest reason for my friends to get nitro on discord is so we can upload bigger clips on our server
[4:13:31] PieceOfPanic: @Aidler Yep, and it's bad for consuimers.
[4:14:01] Aidler: @pieceofpanic yep, sub till you drop
[4:14:11] kashmara: it's just like... wow is 15 for a whole ass game. and 10 for just discord seems odd.
[4:14:15] chinfu303: you can give subs like twitch to discord servers to support the server
[4:14:20] MM0Nerd: discord is a waste
[4:14:28] wEiRdO_dUdE: If Discord is hosting a lot of data and streams, they gotta pay for it some way
[4:14:34] PieceOfPanic: @Aidler Sub ur paycheck away, €10 at the time LUL
[4:14:48] PieceOfPanic: With Nitro u get a soundboard in the discord, access to play games etc. etc.
[4:15:18] PhoenixAuTv: @PieceOfPanic dude, the nsfw ones are pretty funny
[4:15:22] vikaelzidek: is there a main server the people are playing hardcore on?

[4:16:48] gooseboy429: microsoft gonna change it ?
[4:16:49] dracullus: whats the point, instead they can add something in shop
[4:16:50] PieceOfPanic: There'd be an Exodus of WoW, if they made sub more expensive LUL
[4:16:51] 3dRes: That would be the beginning of the end KEKW
[4:16:55] Relic7: xD
[4:16:58] Aidler: basically the everything is free because of advertising is slowly going away… because people hate ads… and companies have less money for ads… etc
[4:17:04] PadidinJones: Glad to see everyone is on the same page
[4:17:06] justagamingfiend: if they include gamepass with a higher sub people would do it
[4:17:08] Kriven: i remember before wow it was like 10 to 12 bucks a month for most MMO subs
[4:17:12] PieceOfPanic: Hahahahahhaa

[4:21:18] mavericks312: @wwishie MS has bought a lot of studios that haven’t done anything yet
[4:21:19] Aidler: @dawnovun the UK alone is not enough to stop the purchase of Blizz
[4:21:21] PieceOfPanic: @Rudric_Ice Hots was a good game.
[4:21:24] PieceOfPanic: IMO

[4:24:01] valianya: MS is appealing UK decision.  UK block was specifically for not enough reassurance that the purchase wouldn't stifle the virtual console gamepass style market, if I recall correctly.

[6:10:31] zeiours: I want to play the switch, but I can't play at 30fps...
[6:10:34] Hitmanblood: If nintendo wants to print money, just make a game with either, Zelda, pokemon, or mario, or smash in the title, free money
[6:10:35] firewalltwitch: @Hitmanblood Breathe of the wild sucked, Tears of the kingdom is great

[6:17:34] grimvex: yup the morladim elite chain
[6:17:48] firewalltwitch: @mavericks312 to be fair small mobile games make more money then say "THE LAST OF US" etc, profits =/= player base
[6:17:56] geokouts: first deliver quest to Darksire and then kill the Elite
[6:18:10] Gendread77: plus lots of micro transactions
[6:18:28] Hitmanblood: the smartest thing blizzard has done, in recent years was releasing wow classic, so much free money got printed from that
[6:18:39] Hitmanblood: very smart low effort and high return
[6:18:42] firewalltwitch: WoW token was genius
[6:19:02] mavericks312: Token was the best move blizz ever done
[6:19:03] Peqdevil: WoW is a cash cow
[6:19:23] Hitmanblood: Wow is keeping their other games on life support right now
[6:19:33] Hitmanblood: blizzard NEEDS diablo 4 right now
[6:19:36] Hitmanblood: or they would of been in trouble
[6:19:44] mavericks312: So if wow actually does then blizz does?
[6:19:53] firewalltwitch: @Towelliee whats ur opinion on OW2 pve cancellation, im worried about blizzards future to deliver
[6:19:56] mavericks312: Dies*
[6:20:16] bloodhounde08: bloodhounde08 subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 58 months! 
[6:20:21] Historyxxx: Wrong. Its because they dont make other games worth a damn at there previous quality that they did back in 2000-2010
[6:20:29] FamLeeGaming: @firewalltwitch I think OW2 PvE cancellation is because they are going to revisit the OW MMO seriously.

[6:20:38] futomara01: d3 had no revenue
[6:20:39] Hitmanblood: The pve being cancelled in OW2, was def a higher up decision. The devs obviously wanted to release it
[6:20:54] mavericks312: @historyxxx never happening stop it
[6:20:55] Hitmanblood: probably was taking to long and the profit that would come from it wasn't enough for the execs
[6:20:57] firewalltwitch: @FamLeeGaming i just dont believe

[6:21:24] Historyxxx: Not Happening because people keep buying there FOmo products on the wow store

[6:23:30] mavericks312: @historyxxx bad product but just put up there best year to date and dropped a top tier xpac okay bud
[6:23:32] firewalltwitch: oh damn!
[6:23:35] PieceOfPanic: LUL
[6:23:41] Hitmanblood: My prediction is next xpac, world of warcraft comes to consoles. They have set up the modern client with more and more controller support
[6:23:47] WonderMog: I know its probably 2025 til its gonna be playable but what do you think of the Riot MMO?
[6:23:49] m0rith: m0rith subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 37 months! 
[6:23:52] Historyxxx: Just reboot wow, Make a Warcraft 4 RTS with a new story and then have the story set further in the future and restart WOW as a new MMO
[6:23:53] Minoumi: how much /played do you have on this 30 char? @Towelliee
[6:23:57] Sogybritches: but the "core" gamers in the US arent likely to play mobile games so they forget about the king part of actiblizzking
[6:23:57] Aidler: @stratiss they are mainly in Asia. much more people over there and they mostly don’t have a PC. they only have a mobile device
[6:24:06] WonderMog: I feel like if any company can compete with Blizzard and WoW, its Riot and an MMO
[6:24:08] Prevention6: A mobile wow mini game with obtainable rewards that tie into actual wow would be cool
[6:24:23] Hitmanblood: i hope it gets the diablo immortal treatment and gets on the blizzard launcher
[6:24:25] Kriven: that arclight rumble annoucement was such a let down for me when I saw it. Did not look appealing at all

[6:25:51] Knocx: it is!
[6:25:51] Historyxxx: WoW is dying because Blizzard is catering to the top 1% of guilds that no one cares about. It happened in Starcraft 2 when they catered to Esports also
[6:26:00] Sogybritches: rts aint dead, just aint as big as it once was
[6:26:04] Historyxxx: so they profit on shop items and FOMO items
[6:26:09] Historyxxx: instead of making a good game

[6:35:59] BobbyBones: a lot of the time you get called in and then sent home or they tell itsl alreayd been settled. It then counts as fulfilling your jury duty
[6:36:02] Outerlaw: oh my
[6:36:03] Favortizm: the defense just wants an unbiased person soo if you show pro police you are out
[6:36:09] renin01: just had jury duty.  criminal case.
[6:36:16] renin01: 3 days in court

[6:36:42] AznAlan15: unfortunately they keep sending notices, its automatic
[6:36:43] Kriven: just keep a blue lives matter shirt in your closet for jury duty
[6:36:47] Mecabeast: looks like someone finished the evoker legendary
[6:36:47] BobbyBones: and it counts as fulfilling your jury duty lol as long as you show up
[6:36:49] Wulfgrym: you're client is a scum bag let him burn!
[6:36:50] OneFlewOver92: having anxiety can get you out of it aswell
[6:36:55] PhillyDilly18: I was in jury selection two weeks ago. There was a woman who was asked how she knew if she could trust someone. She responded with "I don't trust nobody about nothing". She got picked for the jury and looked PISSED

[6:37:26] firewalltwitch: Tom Cruise would have to drop N-Bombs to get out of it Kappa

[6:37:29] ZeusDNA: It wont' be Tom Cruise, it'll be Ben Stiller dressed as Tom Cruise KEKW
[6:37:36] AznAlan15: i accidently carried a folding card knife through the security checkpoint, the captain ran back to catch me and make me bring my knife back to my car
[6:37:37] Noshpan: I had a friend get out of jury duty by showing up wearing a Marilyn Manson "I am the god of fuck" shirt
[6:37:37] AllenzoTV: he just gets his body double to cover for him
[6:37:49] Sogybritches: probably dont get picked because their opinions would influence the other jurors
[6:37:54] wwishie: They would even let him on a jury, it would cost the state too much to keep the press away
[6:37:54] Kriven: its no longer about the case its about tom cruise is a juror so i doubt they ever really get called
[6:38:10] Aidler: a real celebrity would be too influential for the other jurors

[6:51:00] LeDerpski: I just bought two a couple weeks ago those boxes are huge
[6:51:07] KingKreeft: I'm using the Evo, but it's rather stiff, I'm not sending it back tho still an improvement over the old chair
