[1:14:52] ne0rmatrix: what are u going to do for valentines next year if u get the mount?
[1:14:53] Masqerader: 14 8-22 i believe
[1:14:59] akia03: first kill you get it and than you wont have anything to do :)
[1:15:16] Rudenucklehead: Eyebrows gone too?!?!
[1:15:23] Masqerader: they need to get rid of the level limit, just make it the level you can learn it
[1:15:45] PadidinJones: How come there is no archeology in SL?
[1:15:47] Masqerader: not sure why they have these idiotic restrictions in place for early events
[1:16:01] SlayerLightStorm: Yeah, it's going to be difficult for me too since I have to farm for the love rocket on several 50 toons. Juggling that and work...Yikes.
[1:16:05] Masqerader: @PadidinJones cause its a pointless profession and no one does it, plus rewards suck
[1:16:22] Masqerader: that is how many days the event is 8th to 22nd
[1:16:39] PadidinJones: @Masqerader fair enough.
[1:17:21] illi333: Nah it’s lvl 51 Kappa
[1:17:21] pereadin: Island? Doing some mount farming?
[1:17:24] Jarlan23: i hope you get it this year man. blizzy owes you a love rocket
[1:17:38] ventu105: guys what do you think about survival hunter?
[1:17:39] Masqerader: the one item that sells for me from islands is that blue sword forget its name
[1:17:51] SlayerLightStorm: @Jarlan23 Blizz owes me one as well.
[1:17:54] pereadin: thats pretty dece g/h
[1:17:56] Naturecold: Are Islands soloable now?
[1:18:01] ventu105: when is blizzcon?
[1:18:05] Jarlan23: i made like 400 sharpening stones none of those fucking things sell smh
[1:18:09] TheCliffyShow: @PadidinJones They said it's missing in Shadowlands because arcahegloy is a pursuit of mortals, not the Shadowlands. Maybe, they didn't want to fuck with it. I don't know.
[1:18:12] Masqerader: @ventu105 19/20th
[1:18:17] ventu105: ty
[1:18:27] sladinatorx: Is it worth getting into wow now or is it too late and gonna die soon?
[1:18:35] PToastman: Lol
[1:18:39] Masqerader: @louiesladdenboi its been dead for 16 years
[1:18:47] Masqerader: ....
[1:18:48] shutyourface: certain blues sell very well
[1:18:48] TheCliffyShow: @louiesladdenboi It's not to late.
[1:18:54] Lintgamer: Why would you buy that? transmog?
[1:19:03] PadidinJones: Hardly anyone is using them. Sharpening stones is a thing of classic
[1:19:06] Jarlan23: i made bank from that sky glider for that mount in bastion. like 600k in 3 weeks or so
[1:19:20] shutyourface: damn that sells for like 3 times that on my server
[1:19:29] feninr: @Towelliee undercutting by that much really fucks the market :)
[1:19:30] shutyourface: one of the best sword mogs too
[1:19:36] sladinatorx: How do i learn about it i watch it so much but theres so much stuff i have no clue how it works and and how do i make friends
[1:19:43] Masqerader: i went in there with a friends shaman and he got a lvl in and half at lvl 30 something he said after it was done
[1:19:46] PadidinJones: @TheCliffyShow I hear you. Either that or they just cut it out becuase of no time
[1:19:47] SlayerLightStorm: Pfft, the Leatherworking legendary pieces sell pretty decently @Towelliee
[1:19:50] Zarinna2015: Islands, Torghast, both are fail systems by Blizzard
[1:20:08] feninr: lol ok :)
[1:20:16] Masqerader: free market
[1:20:16] pereadin: Gotta tell em "shut up nerd" at that point xD
[1:20:23] shutyourface: islands def a fail
[1:20:25] TheCliffyShow: @Towelliee The Impressable gorger spawn actually doesn't stay in your bags. It runs off and you have to go to the Endmire for it to spawn and get the quests.
[1:20:36] Grock: islands
[1:20:39] fewyn: if torghast had actual rewards it'd be amazing
[1:20:45] dopieGG: the reward of Torghast is how much fun it is, and challenging.
[1:20:46] PrimalRain: torghast currently
[1:20:54] Zarinna2015: A good system is playable and reqarding. Neither are both.

[1:22:20] Reiumi_: 30g?! KomodoHype
[1:22:23] Angerina: give us slutmog pieces

[1:22:39] theinsanepaynes: progression / accomplishment means something. getting nothing for hours of work just leaves a meh feeling
[1:22:40] largefromage: LUL
[1:23:07] fewyn: just give me 35 anima for completing torghast
[1:23:13] thebakeriscomingforu: Torghast is a great idea. It was just "phoned in" when implemented
[1:23:33] jaysteea: 30 anima is enoough you dont want to have same rewards as dungeons
[1:23:41] BaronBauer: @thunderbrew you just got old
[1:23:47] BaronBauer: told *
[1:24:13] Thunderbrew: There has been a lot of complaining about Shadowlands, must be a bad expansion

[1:25:34] Kapatha: @Towelliee You are right ..after 4 months they will rewards us with something big ...maybe ability to wear a secomd legendary ?
[1:25:43] dreamjag: would you say nathria is a disappointing raid. i think it’s not that good.
[1:26:02] thegummibearmassacre: D:
[1:26:16] Thoreya: very curious to see what the 9.0.5 patch is about

[1:26:48] Masqerader: boost my blood!? "go stand in a corner and think about what you said"
[1:26:49] WoW_StandalonE: nah, wod 1st raid was better
[1:26:52] thebakeriscomingforu: Dunno Kara was the shit
[1:27:04] Zarinna2015: No way man Naxx was amazing!!!!!
[1:27:10] MrGattz: im sure hes fine.
[1:27:13] Crowzcut: show it on stream lol
[1:27:23] Zarinna2015: Kara was amazing actually
[1:27:24] jiranu: DPS classes mad about castle cause they have to hold dps at so many points in the raid they just wanna pump
[1:27:34] ne0rmatrix: 2020 had enough drama i just wish we could have skipped it
[1:28:20] Bjerring1999123: i feel like its faster to level with the storyline rather than doing the fate thing
[1:28:26] Masqerader: i'd play classic tbc just to play Kara
[1:28:35] Lintgamer: The raid
[1:28:39] WoW_StandalonE: Highmaul was better then CN
[1:28:58] Megadisaster24: Idk, but his Video says otherwise
[1:28:58] Lintgamer: During his last vid he told he didnt like it
[1:29:34] NewWorldReign: whats the worst raid in WoW in your opinion?
[1:29:35] Scoodles91: loot probebly
[1:29:37] thebakeriscomingforu: Preach in his last video looked like a broken man. I would take it all with a grain of salt
[1:29:40] kharditv: how you feel without your fuzz
[1:29:55] Sincline387: preach wants drama so he says it sucks so people watch.....money is why he doesn't like it.
[1:29:56] Crowzcut: ye he was
[1:30:04] griffdog125: lol prob not the raid he didn't like. was prob being benched he didn't like
[1:30:36] CrunkyBrewster: how did he get benched? he was playing Hunter right?
[1:30:41] kharditv: @towelliee feels so nekked right now without that beard sadge
[1:30:41] NewWorldReign: How is Preach as a raid member?
[1:30:52] cozyzequel: beard is gone... :(
[1:30:55] thegummibearmassacre: LUL
[1:31:40] borisdic: like 20 min
[1:31:41] CrunkyBrewster: 15+ minutes I think
[1:31:46] Antdavs24: like 20 mins
[1:31:49] Jarlan23: react content PogChamp ?
[1:32:15] CrunkyBrewster: yeah he brought up loot. but its also like other ssaid. the stop points int he raid he didnt like
[1:32:22] traynor56: maybe it was the team being a bit negative
[1:32:24] Korupcija_: new PILAV VIDEO!
[1:32:28] Jarlan23: lol you dont lik e bellular?
[1:32:32] MrGattz: yo @Towelliee did you see this concept on reddit? https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/lbpvvg/how_to_fix_mythic_plus/
[1:32:34] borisdic: idk i guess he was just salty and lashed out on the raid itself, idk lol
[1:32:45] Epicsapphire1988: what happend to asmon ? he taking abreak?
[1:32:49] NewWorldReign: @Towelliee there has to be a raid dungeon you were totally against due to how bad it looked
[1:32:52] CrunkyBrewster: also because a lot of people like him now have family and such. i think he needs to accept that maybe... he's going casual LUL nothing wrong with that
[1:33:06] kirshoxd: there is a new currency vendor on upcoming ptr so maybe we getting a "valor like" system
[1:33:20] ne0rmatrix: how long did it take u to balance IRL and streaming?
[1:33:21] mufo85: loot, buggy mechanics and his guildies not having fun made him annoyed by it
[1:33:36] Cyberl0c0: @Towelliee ahhhh, your face is soooo clean!!!!\
[1:33:47] Bulgogiprince: oooh nice shave Towelliee
[1:34:02] Scoodles91: wasnt the build encrypted?
[1:34:03] Skerd_: Buggy bosses, 2nd to last boss being harder than the final boss, some bosses needing to stop dps just because dps had a good pull was some of his reasoning
[1:34:09] CrunkyBrewster: yes
[1:34:12] Drakonus: it cant be datamined yet its a vendor as in distrabution
[1:34:17] kirshoxd: aa you are correct sir

[2:20:52] Gruffian: That missed pack and the big mob and you were good. they were 9.2% total
[2:21:05] RocketMan23: i think the strat now is to not use the spear on the first boss so you have it for this guy
[2:21:23] Holysal: btw you can BoP the Dark Ritual so they dont get taken down
[2:21:24] mrrazputin: @BlueBlurPrime its not a bug its timer. if your slow you can get even 3 at once

[3:19:01] Haotududis: I've played with like 2 ferals this xpac so far and they've both pumped. But I can understand what you mean re: mythic prog lol
[3:19:12] Ashurian83: when you see a feral in raid you say how did blizzard not kill that spec yet
[3:19:17] Clawanorder: Its not that feral is bad. its just, when you can have a boomkin/ range dps instead... vs another melee
[3:19:21] Affiiance: Feral would be eating up a WW or DK melee spot
[3:19:26] stjon13: wasn't feral looking good for SL at one point?
[3:19:35] swordwindgaming: m+ affixes hate melee too
[3:19:39] Megadisaster24: kinda toxic
[3:19:40] Holysal: theres better melle
[3:19:42] thiccsushi: 0 reason to bring feral over boomkin
[3:19:44] Holysal: melee
[3:19:49] smilylol_: Feral is decent at CN because of the amt of movement on bosses, but thats about it lol
[3:19:56] Ertra: melee in general is a bad call in SL
[3:20:06] AdoraVal: I really am not a fan of playing a spec that I don't like just because it's meta, but its the only way I get into raids. fenSad
[3:20:10] Affiiance: Nah WW and DK are great, better than most Ranged
[3:20:11] swordwindgaming: you need 1 melee for M+, but just 1
[3:20:16] JmacTV: Feral is more like tame housecat now
[3:20:26] swordwindgaming: DK puts in work
[3:20:27] Barkerisonfire: Yeah but people should play whatever they find fun, 2/3 of player base and probably more aren't playing at the tip top tier
[3:20:40] Shrenko: 9min monkaS
[3:20:42] Affiiance: You guys realize WW/DK in M+ is amazing together with a Mage

[3:22:19] nihav: All this '' people should play what they like'' fall apart if they want to raid/M+ competitively. Wow is filled with meta slaves and unless you become one of them there is no place for class fantasies etc
[3:22:37] swordwindgaming: m+ is optional content, its not meant for "play for fun" types
[3:22:41] Affiiance: Even in Mid Level M+ and Raiding its just better to take Meta SPecs

[3:58:54] CameronParadox: Wow you shaved
[3:59:14] akia03: would lose less dps to just keep pet out after lust than dismissing it
[3:59:15] BoscoSyrup: your beard looks a little more filled in than usual
[3:59:21] Reven1335: Tranq is enrage and magic
[3:59:35] 3663Sharad: Really didnt know that
[4:00:00] Sollice: @diathi123 Yep. The dismiss time it takes you will lose more than the 10% of Lone Wolf

[4:02:53] warrenny: Its annoying as melee
[4:02:56] zaraine1: fuck grievous
[4:02:57] swordwindgaming: Tornado is just an unnecessarily annoying mechanic. You can't make positional fights and then add a mechanic to screw up your positionals with good intentions.
[4:03:21] Gnral: monk is much better
[4:03:53] JmacTV: Do tornados have a locked path? I swear the fuckers chase me

[4:25:12] Lintgamer: Jaina mount
[4:25:19] hellboptv: @Towelliee would you say the brewmaster is better than a prot pali for shadowlands mythic+?
[4:25:22] FresheFefe: like the shaman class mount
[4:25:23] CozzyFlannel: It's different re-skin tho. not just color change
[4:25:23] mmrghost7: it's the same things as bfd mount
[4:25:24] luckfore: jaina mount reskin LUL
[4:25:33] tdpark_: POG

[4:27:30] BoscoSyrup: is it still possible to get jaina mount?
[4:27:43] Ekvision: you got to show that stuff
[4:27:52] Roffasauras: yes, but not guaranteed drop anymore @BoscoSyrup
[4:27:59] TiredCarcass: beard mia
[4:28:09] Mecabeast: like 5% drop or something now for jaina mount
[4:28:16] Daggerstry: You are already getting seasonal rewards now. That is enough
[4:28:17] Moobot: Calm the spam, @Megladon18 (warning)
[4:28:41] Quakezilla69: i fee like 20 is a bit steep
[4:28:53] borisdic: then they would have to give out 233 gear
[4:29:01] gorilla_quantistico: i fell mount should be +20 and mog +10 and 15

[4:48:32] ItsFish26: there is a boss in the maw that rides that mount
[4:49:06] bennythejet_ne: Oh word alright I should be good then I hope
[4:49:24] luckfore: its the patch with valor points for pve
[4:49:27] NILLme: 9.0.5 will be a systems patch for sure, doubt there will be new content
[4:49:32] Ekvision: or on blizzconline
[4:49:57] DeanoTV: 0.5 patch next month maybe?
[4:50:00] wazon_7: just nerf fucking boomkins already
[4:50:11] luckfore: new systems? NotLikeThis
[4:50:18] Affiiance: I mean there sooo much shit to do we dont need a content patch right now
[4:50:32] Armdel: are we already rolling into the azerite 2.0 equivalent

[4:51:28] datNovazGG: I hope you're right.. Cause I'm chilling with my KSM haha
[4:51:38] datNovazGG: Otherwise I'm w/e with KSM tbh :)
[4:51:54] Daggerstry: Wait..... so what is he doing now?
[4:52:14] dwolters_the_zombieman: anima feels like artifact and azurite power grind but slower
[4:52:24] Mecabeast: intro ql for 9.1 maybe more torghast layers for higher soul ash per week.
[4:52:27] datNovazGG: @dwolters good thing it isn't :D
[4:52:34] wazon_7: @dwolters
[4:52:37] Roughneck124: I’ve been saying this. They should use anima to be able to get those weapons and stuff from those venders in the covenant area. That would solve a lot.
[4:52:47] dwolters_the_zombieman: lol
[4:52:57] wazon_7: @dwolters how does anima feel like azerite or artifact?? it's not even mandatory for power progression, its all cosmetics
[4:52:59] Sollice: They arent going to do that. They are raid weapons
[4:53:22] GoGetItKo: @Mecabeast maybe if you can wear 2 legendary items. but otherwise don't need soul ash though
[4:53:25] Daggerstry: I want more covenant campaign quests. Like..... the Venthyr one leaves you without a medallion and Renathal doing nothing
[4:53:27] datNovazGG: The only "mandatory" of anima is the 1k weekly for renown otherwise it really doesn't matter :p
[4:53:33] Thadune: @Towelliee reskins?
[4:53:39] zenothebambino: I did torghast as a brewmaster for the first time instead of WW and wtf it's was a breeze LUL rather than stressin I was chillen on layer 8 lol
[4:53:46] Sollice: @Daggerstry They will have more with each patch. Needs to last the entire xpac
[4:53:51] wreckshoptv: i feel like torghast is failed its just a chore for soul ash
[4:53:52] lceWoIf: 1 floor up
[4:53:53] luckfore: thorgast so boring..zzzz
[4:53:53] wazon_7: and 1k anima takes like 15min of doing few world quests
[4:54:03] MrKray2: Look at da smooth chin on that sexy man!
[4:54:22] iitsmadness: torghast more like choreghast
[4:54:32] dwolters_the_zombieman: for covenant and other stuff it's like too many things require it but not enough for reward

[4:55:21] pilhass10: not possible yet
[4:55:31] Shugnight: ya mounts all day for me lol
[4:55:37] Gargeth: All mine is level 1 minus the sanctum one is level 2 lol.
[4:55:43] Holysal: im not even worried about Sanctum bc anime is toxic
[4:55:43] luckfore: i hope so
[4:55:49] Lundorf: i mean you get no anima.... how can we upgrade it
[4:55:51] wreckshoptv: i got 1 thing at lvl 3
[4:55:54] robbo1010: Have u had issues with bonus objectives from threads of fate still showing even after your 60?
[4:55:58] KingSlayerYotam: i have rank 2 special building on all cov, + done with mounts from vendors
[4:56:03] Clicklesly: What point is there in spending on the sanctum after getting the conductor to R3 and maybe mission table a bit ^^
[4:56:08] wazon_7: because sanctum is like whatever, the only good perk is the oribos portal but thats it
[4:56:12] cavj0r: @robbo1010 its cuis u get 1 renown for completing it
[4:56:23] PvtHudson093: I quit because of the loot situation
[4:56:30] raptorstrick: Yup
[4:56:31] wreckshoptv: increase anime drop rate
[4:56:52] raldrik: yeah sanctum seems like it is alot of work. They have to do 4x the work to cover the player base rather than dungeons/raids/WQ's that cover everyone
[4:56:58] Mecabeast: I have conductor r3 almost transport r3 then will prob do mission table 2 and 3 then will do abom factory to 2 3
[4:57:01] xluckydawgx: Yeah tbh ive stopped caring about my sanctum because the anima grind is too much
[4:57:01] luckfore: its funny in WoD they said we had way to many followers and now we have even more LUL
[4:57:02] Umoran: increase end of M+ anima reward from 35 to 40!
[4:57:11] wreckshoptv: lol
[4:57:16] MistaHat: A VENDOR IS SOMETHING SMALL THEY CAN ADD TOO JUST SAYING LOL
[4:57:51] Mecabeast: cause wasn't 8.0.5 where we got zandalari and darkshore?
[4:57:58] luckfore: cant they just up the loot like how it was in expansions before SL?
[4:58:09] RocketMan23: what about a way to upgrade the M+ gear you already have?
[4:58:12] balanira: callings should 100% give anima
[4:58:26] dwolters_the_zombieman: yeah I don't think it's really alt friendly with the gear system
[4:58:43] Moondrius: callings give gold
[4:58:48] raldrik: They need to give us a flight whistle with the patch
[4:58:48] Moondrius: and rep
[4:58:57] xluckydawgx: lol fuck callings
[4:58:58] MistaHat: But the problem isnt upgrades, per say, it is acquisition because people are spending time in multiple dungeons without a drop. Do you think you just increase loot drop by one for in time and completion and then just do upgrades?
[4:58:58] Fptlol: pvp system is great for alts
[4:59:03] xluckydawgx: I just do it for rep
[4:59:10] Lexi__Marie: ok but dont take the gold away
[4:59:14] Lexi__Marie: from callings
[4:59:15] luckfore: what is Blizz saying in their intern channels?
[4:59:20] xluckydawgx: But i only need 1 more bastion calling for exalted and it hasnt come up in a week
[4:59:24] Moondrius: what's 205?
[4:59:34] Feorasam: because they lowered mplus and heroic raid doesn't give enough gear

[4:59:35] PvtHudson093: ilvl 205
[4:59:55] Subspace13: why is your nose so shiny
[4:59:55] Mecabeast: I have 4 pieces at 200 still because stuff just won't drop need to get people to pvp with
[5:00:01] Moondrius: is that normal raid ilvl?
[5:00:13] PvtHudson093: I wasnt having fun anymore
[5:00:29] Tyredex: Tyredex subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 56 months! 
[5:00:58] ptperkins: you shouldnt need HC gear to do HC content though
[5:00:59] pera_red: maybe some kind of token for getting 2 pieces from the vault
[5:01:27] mo197: oondasta fun
[5:01:38] pavepawns: it also doesnt fix the value of a 15+ being less then hc
[5:01:43] wazon_7: there should be a reroll button in vault that u can use once per 2 weeks or so
[5:01:59] aye_kram: haven't gotten much from hc raids, mostly getting gear from vault
[5:02:01] tybas3dg0d: what's the main font that you use
[5:02:03] KPable: this week is the boost to me
[5:02:07] zenothebambino: if you're not doing +5 keys for 210 you're trolling if you're already over 200 though even as a casual
[5:02:12] swordwindgaming: Thats why only m10+ matters. The ilvl from lower mythic vault rewards isn't worth.
[5:02:13] KPable: M+ is easy for 10s
[5:02:15] Fptlol: welfare gear removes alot of value too though

[5:02:39] luckfore: reroll reward system to legion/bfa and bring back bonus roll
[5:02:45] thebakeriscomingforu: just a badge vendor would "fix" it
[5:02:47] MistaHat: I miss Legion..
[5:02:54] Evcon_: you can do +10s at 205 and get 220 ill from vault
[5:02:56] chubby_ch4ser: How about just take ur loss, if its shit
[5:02:57] PhillyRhino: Soul Ash to reroll. Keeps Torghast worthwhile \o/
[5:02:58] raldrik: That still doesnt help the fact that doing the actual dungeon still feels horrible. You have to wait a week to see why you ran it
[5:03:08] zantease: Any tips you can give for Hpal, I am struggling with the melee healing, feels broken to me, or i am doing something wrong
[5:03:08] luckfore: @MistaHat same :\
[5:03:09] Mecabeast: 20k stygia reroll vault
[5:03:18] KingSlayerYotam: vault changes are unnecessary, mythic + need a progression system like pvp
[5:03:20] foxdie889: thats why i stopped playing this game because you need to put a lot of time into it now and i do not have the time anymore.
[5:03:28] luckyfooo: luckyfooo subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 6 months! heya
[5:03:38] luckfore: which changes? Kappa
[5:04:12] bigb0ngrip: that's how it should be we pay them to make us happy
[5:04:13] redtemplar88: When Mythic raiders have to run PvP to get their ilvl up then gear is an issue.
[5:04:25] tebbix: is it too early to say that this expansion is better than BFA?
[5:04:30] Vigi9413: but everyone complains now
[5:04:30] Moobot: towGreen Shadowlands Limited Edition TOWELLIEE covenant shirts AND Towelliee hats are LIVE! check them out HERE! | Dbh.la/towelliee towBlue
[5:04:38] Moondrius: I guess my main concern is the bad people you do mythic + with. people who do +6 - +9 can't seem to do mechanics and dps. always failing the run early on.
[5:04:39] MistaHat: This might be a controversial subject...but i think Legendaries were to easy to obtain. I feel like they could have done a lot more to make them a chase item instead of like a guarantee week 2. It was just too fast. With Legion it was rng but took too long. They needed to find a middle ground
[5:04:55] luckfore: its because of bad communication during alpha/beta
[5:04:58] EpicJune: it cause they fix it then throw it out by the next xpac LUL
[5:05:41] dwolters_the_zombieman: i wish they have better transportation than what covenants have because they put quest for progression that you have to go through elites to get there
[5:05:47] luckfore: its not legendary worthy tbh
[5:05:48] zenothebambino: i think with the great vault it's kinda hard to get stuck at an ilvl that's not cap.. just doing +5s gives you 210 from the vault.
[5:05:49] Affiiance: Fuck that I dont know how many of yall are rolling in Leggos but that shit is expensive if you play alts
[5:05:58] toobaked1987: Did KSM happen babyface?
[5:06:02] pavepawns: CHEAPEST? mate mail legs are expensive
[5:06:39] ne0rmatrix: Would it not be great if blizzard were to make equipping an item a gated micro transaction that could only be purchased after farming torghast for a significant amount of stuff.
[5:06:39] Shortyyyb: id like if you had 3 ilvl 200 items in vault you can "trade them up" for a 205 or something
[5:06:57] I_DoctorSatan_I: I bought my Fury Warriors ilvl 235 wrists for 44k today SeemsGood ez snipe
[5:07:00] MistaHat: @pavepawns you know he means cheapest as in easy to acquire, not hard to obtain, not "legendary"
[5:07:02] luckfore: its horrible tbh
[5:07:05] zalimah: hasnt it been like that foir about 6 years now
[5:07:08] bmartinez50: Any more mythic 15 runs I can join??
[5:07:13] luckfore: so many of my friends quit
[5:07:16] BigCarlM: very true
[5:07:18] bennythejet_ne: Couldn’t agree more—I feel like I am working and investing and I reap the benefits once a week
[5:07:19] xCuzo: In theory though, shouldn't the gameplay be the fun part ?
[5:07:26] Thadune: @Towelliee I've ran like 20 M+ dungeons to get... 35 anima
[5:07:37] MistaHat: @Thadune we all have brother, we all have
[5:07:50] BrutalBlueberry: Yo who is this 15yr old talking WoW
[5:07:51] ThatW0lF: ThatW0lF subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 5 months! Whats up hammer bros!
[5:07:55] Parentosx: so you think 15s should drop 216?
[5:07:55] KingsandClubs: They should make m+15 drop 213
[5:08:04] aranzaboi: im just thinking to myself how boring the game would be without m+
[5:08:05] Marokkolin: gearing sucks
[5:08:06] bennythejet_ne: I have run over 40 10+ keys and still have 200 and 203 gear
[5:08:06] DiosZnC: @lugtread in theory this is a looter game. It’s fun getting loot that’s the purpose of wow
[5:08:13] swordwindgaming: dungeon vault loot sucks most of the time because the risk of getting a loot piece that you didn't really need is too high, and arena vault loot becomes useless after a while
[5:08:47] xCuzo: @DiosEnVy Right but we're talking about ONLY tuesday being fun, whcih I don't agree with
[5:08:49] SpoonManes: i thinki flying in SL gonna be nice
[5:08:52] Roffasauras: It took me 3 weeks to get a piece of 226 from the vault that was useful NotLikeThis
[5:08:53] KingsandClubs: Is that on eu?
[5:08:56] Justarandomman: Worst thing about keys, is people leaving for no reason, happened 3 weeks in a row for me on my +14 (puglife)
[5:08:57] paradoxTheDJ: would you take a 202 Healer??
[5:08:59] Sollice: No NA
[5:09:14] Sollice: @bmac6996 I think he said anything over 200
[5:09:18] dwolters_the_zombieman: i been getting nothing but transmog in the vault really because i am not getting anything for upgrade to do normal raid
[5:09:22] Parentosx: 216 for 15s
[5:09:36] Thadune: @Towelliee I dont think they should have cucked M+ loot as bad as they did. Theres what a 3 item level difference between a +14 and Normal Nathria? How the fuck is the even.
[5:09:39] zenothebambino: it should 100% be higher if you get higher from the vault for doing that lol

[5:09:45] pavepawns: 217 id say
[5:09:46] bigb0ngrip: yeah I'm pretty fed up myself doing pugs 9/10 it doesn't go right.
[5:09:50] luckfore: i cba doing M+ this expanion while i really enjoyed doing it in bfa, its so unrewarding
[5:09:54] KingsandClubs: Yeah that sounds good to
[5:10:00] Gnral: m+ needs a currency
[5:10:05] DiosZnC: 216. Right in the middle of Heroic and mythic seems fair
[5:10:17] FresheFefe: the vault loot is the problem

[5:10:23] paradoxTheDJ: cool i guess i'll login
[5:10:27] Justarandomman: I think they need change it so a higher key is more rewarding, for example why do a 13, when u do a 12 for SAME REWARD?
[5:11:12] bigb0ngrip: I wouldn't mind mythic + and the gearing if I had a consistent group to do them with
[5:11:17] Gargeth: I wanted to queue, but I have a meeting in 10 minutes. RIP.
[5:11:23] toobaked1987: @Towelliee did you get KSM?
[5:11:29] Hothus: is this on NA or EU?
[5:11:29] Secondbreakfasttt: 2-3-9 would be better
[5:11:34] KingsandClubs: At least make +10>+15 drop more anima jesus blizzard
[5:11:37] wreckshoptv: i would join but on EU :S
[5:11:41] xluckydawgx: I have a meeting at 12 and then lunch or else id join :/
[5:11:46] Redpandalol: @towelliee you gonna play the new resident evil?
[5:11:48] Justarandomman: it really makes 13 keys hard to get groups in pugs, how it is
[5:12:03] I_DoctorSatan_I: i think 9.1 is going to be the focal point of gear improvemetns. If ION swears up and down how the gearing aspect is going to improve and they don't deliver, Blizzard should prepare in loss of subs, quick.
[5:12:04] ne0rmatrix: Unfortunately normal does not drop anything I need
[5:12:17] HaxzorJimDuggan: May 14th i think
[5:12:19] stallowned: take him! LUL
[5:12:20] bigb0ngrip: yeah that's another thing it's bad enough you just get anima but at least make it worth our while like 35 anima fuck off LUL

[5:12:30] Redpandalol: Big vampire mommy
[5:12:31] CDubTheRIPper: If blizzard is steadfast on this type of loot then they are probably steering wow away from m+.. idk why because it got super popular
[5:12:58] ShinyLox: I cant even find your group
[5:13:02] terru: even legion we had to run normals for more chances to leggo...
[5:13:08] luckfore: i think blizzard listened to much to a minority of the player base
[5:13:31] paulson14: Love this game been playing since the beginning but holy doing hard content doesn't not feel worth it right now
[5:13:33] paulson14: 35 anima

[5:14:34] bigb0ngrip: @brutalblueberry there's no way.
[5:14:34] shimwood: I don't know why people are complaining about loot, just be a terrible player. I get loot every week Kappa
[5:14:38] motorboatingpro: nah, this is what players asked for, they wanted loot to be meaningful... to do that, its now more scarce
[5:14:39] paradoxTheDJ: hmm can't find the group..
[5:14:40] thebakeriscomingforu: They saw that Classic sold well enough that they thought to do the same loot system in wow

[5:14:50] Clay2K_: @insanity2195 ty

[5:14:54] paradoxTheDJ: must be for the connected servers that Toweliee is on.
[5:14:59] Archiee: Screw meaningful choice.... I want that LOOOOOOOOOT!

[5:15:01] kokochris: "Where my loot, imma cut ya ass"
[5:15:03] BrutalBlueberry: @bigb0ngrip I mean there is a way. It's happened. I've gotten Anima every boss.
[5:15:05] Saphirosa_Dragonaspect: same with covenants. i dont give a flying fuck about that separation
[5:15:08] thebakeriscomingforu: RPGs have little to do with loot. Fun classes and great story do that
[5:15:18] MrAxeffect: i was puggin heroic last night and so many players were not 210 yet, it blew my mind
[5:15:27] paulson14: more anima and valor points would be sweet for mythic +
[5:15:27] KingsandClubs: Like the great Notorious BIG said Gimme the Loot!!
[5:15:37] Vigi9413: how to get invited with low ilvl.. role heals lol
