[0:30:35] Lothuz21: No no, I had my own guild since start of TBC but I cant join a guild (work times). But since I disbanded my guild there is only GDKP, except runs that fkin suck. I just dont enjoy the GDKP raids.
[0:30:52] imsexyandinoed: @Lothuz21 why not?
[0:31:00] Zehmox: @Lothuz21 theres plenty off runs that are sr
[0:31:06] kenpachie11: maybe you can invite milk to join discord after the raid and discuss the future of GDKPs
[0:31:42] dad_blaster: GDKP's were the only way to incentivize people to try. SR's always devolve into carrying shitters since people don't feel the need to try.
[0:32:02] Lothuz21: 100%, im not arguing that. I just dont personally enjoy GDKP runs, cant really explain why but I just hate them.

[0:32:37] swedishviking345: grey parsers get all loot in gdkps LUL

[0:33:00] GODDAN_gdn: if u loose items u get gold
[0:33:01] kenpachie11: Blizzard are trying to save SoD by banning GDKP
[0:33:04] Drunkuser_bg: (typing) witch: Without gdkp when tanks and healers get their loot the raid is over perma until next patch xdxd  (evil_laugh) (kiss) (whipcrack)

[0:33:11] Zehmox: @Bobowscii irrelavant cuz a good player would still outperform with 2nd bis
[0:33:14] ThenarOG: Imagine crying and swiping card to wipe those tears off.
[0:33:25] kenpachie11: so the hunter logs u just showed
[0:33:28] kenpachie11: is a superior player?
[0:33:30] kenpachie11: LUL
[0:33:32] Zehmox: an optimized char will still outperform a full bis oiler
[0:33:33] ThenarOG: You're not a wow players if you actually convert your mindset to a gold swiping raid method.
[0:33:44] ThenarOG: This is insane
[0:33:46] ThenarOG: gold is expensive
[0:33:48] Lothuz21: Maybe its cause im just fkin poor and hate seeing the apes getting shit.
[0:33:54] Bobowscii: great, so i have to do that a bunch of time while the whale get their bis
[0:33:56] imsexyandinoed: If some1 swiped you get more gold > you can buy more gear next raid...
[0:33:56] antvann: Gold from GDKP works as a badluck protection
[0:34:02] squeak_tv: U literally can't stop ppl leaving mid raid when their item doesn't drop ddxd

[0:34:16] talys90: @Lothuz21 yeah if someone spends 600k plus in GDKP hes bought it anyway
[0:34:16] falsecopyofsunder: gdkp is a better version of dkp SeemsGood
[0:34:21] Drunkuser_bg: (typing) witch:  It's time for new era of GDKP called Paypal gdkp with personal loot  taking offers on whisper and we just pay a flat fee to the host depending on how entertaining he is KEKL (evil_laugh) (kiss) (whipcrack)

[0:34:36] Lothuz21: Yeah I know, I used to run GDKPs to get gold to support my guild raiding, but I just never enjoyed paying for my items.
[0:34:42] lassekoongoo: if i lose item i report u for gold buyer xdd
[0:34:46] imsexyandinoed: @Lothuz21 You start With 0 gold, and if you wanna gear characters faster you make more characters to generate more gold faster HOWEVER, if you are a 1 character andy enjoyer yes the starting period requires you to save up the first 4-7 raids
[0:34:49] talys90: @kenpachie11 100 on skull of ghuldan never forget

[0:35:45] ghostgalx: @Drunkuser_bg KEKInsane
[0:35:50] imsexyandinoed: I can see the starting period being discouraging for someone who enjoys 1 character but once u get into it there is no going back...
[0:35:54] squirtlesquirt: I like buying gold to join gdkps
[0:35:57] Zehmox: Tate: People against GDKP are a bunch off noobs that are brokies irl or suck ingame the average casual just gets deducted and flamed and its an easy system to detect them. Stay broke or get good

[0:36:35] kenpachie11: Laty is addicted to GDKPs, he killed his own guild just so he has more time to run GDKPs, change my mind
[0:36:41] Sevaer: All I can say if i see any filthy GDKP runs on this channel im reporting you straight to daddy blizzard
[0:36:53] squeak_tv: Milky owning dads
[0:36:54] Riceyx: ppl will probably host some still on discord @squirtlesquirt

[0:37:00] squirtlesquirt: too
[0:37:17] talys90: systematic issue ofc
[0:37:21] the_kev_gaming: Gdkp's will still exist via discord anyway nobody cares on sod
[0:37:27] Lothuz21: @Zehmox I understand the logic but just the thought of lvling characters to run gdkps to get gold to buy gear on the character I want items on, that makes me wanna gouge my eyes out, I fkin hate lvling.
[0:37:30] deeeepx: just gonna decrease
[0:37:45] squirtlesquirt: ok I’m gonna buy more gold on sod for discord gdkp
[0:37:46] imsexyandinoed: The only thing the "ban" on gdkps will do is have GDKP enjoyers quit the game, theres no way any1 goes to another loot system after being a GDKP enjoyer..
[0:37:49] Riceyx: xdd
[0:37:54] flemminggXD: i love gdkps, but they would be even more good without rmt
[0:38:06] Drunkuser_bg: (typing) witch: How to fix the game is BAN GDKP . Make personal loot. Make trading limited to 1-2k per week.  Make every item BOE except end-game raids so ppl could use gold for something and game is playable again xdxd(evil_laugh) (kiss) (whipcrack)

[0:38:35] squirtlesquirt: I’m gonna buy more gold for phase 2 though
[0:38:36] Zehmox: @Lothuz21 nah i played classic with 1 char only and ended up 2 items from full bis as a non goldbuyer on my rogue, i played with lulek tho every reset and did mc/bwl/aq/aq20/zg to afford my naxx items

[0:41:19] Eplios: Witch: Just kidding Laty xddL gl on gressil brother (kiss)
[0:41:30] Lothuz21: @Zehmox Yeah but if I wanted to gear a character now I would have to run so many gdkps to get gold to even get a decently geared toon. It works fine if you already have a lot of gold and just cycle the gold in the group, but if you dont it sucks imo.

[6:29:56] SGkieran: witch: Defile is an AoE which is centered on a random raid member. Whenever it deals damage, it grows larger and increases its damage output. This ability is extremely dangerous and the major cause of wipes in this encounter. In order to avoid Defile, the raid must be spread out. You may want to consider using preassigned spread out positions on 10, to try to control the defiles, (fart)
