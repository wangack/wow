[2:11:01] Sebleh: because your body now knows it can expect you to give it real food instead of eating itself.
[2:11:01] Tayyun: does it trigger you when ppl break pasta ? :O
[2:11:33] Sebleh: oh wait sorry I forgot it’s actually your human body is expecting your husband to hunt a fox to feed you because we still live in 6000 BC Kappa

[2:13:54] charlehead: @itsclubby tankier than hunter let me tell you that
[2:14:21] Sebleh: @maexchenb you take turns anyway. each debuff drops after about 3 charges and you have 5 people so you juggle the debuffs by intercepting the charge on another player.

[2:19:06] StephixOne: @brandogzz no
[2:19:29] StephixOne: you want to get out of P1 ASAP, before people die to the randomly-targetted unstoppable nuke shadow bolt being shot every 4 seconds or something
[2:19:42] sim967: there’s no good time for lust on this boss
[2:20:05] StephixOne: on Fort you can lust after first laser intermission and get full value for example
[2:20:22] StephixOne: but on Tyr, P1 will kill you if you run out of defensives and things before you're out of it
[2:20:27] Maexchenb: @sim967 i lust when i lust this boss in the phase where you get the buff.

[2:24:21] burlemarx: I think you cant get bolted 2 times in a role, but I could be wrong.
[2:24:53] Sebleh: what if you have no full moon charges?
[2:24:59] Sebleh: do you just melee for mana?
[2:25:02] skeeld: @Sebleh then u already fucked up
[2:25:10] skeeld: save all full moons for when swarm is on you
[2:25:12] Sebleh: @burlemarx you can get double targeted. there’s no prevention.

[2:34:01] Xulu_: Surely it's not a camera problem. Naguura never has camera problems...

[2:42:09] Guilleeee: how do you connect it to your pc? usb?
[2:42:41] jagge_: boomie meta in mdi u think?
[2:43:22] Sebleh: maybe your voice is broken and it causes the static noise naguuraWeirdChamp
[2:43:44] ikateyou: from my experiences, static noise is usually a cable issue
[2:44:07] skeeld: do you put these roots in specific spots or do you just dump them in random places
[2:44:16] skeeld: i never know if there's  a good pattern for them or somethingf
[2:44:40] tea2468: how do u do a 28 M+ and have a normal convo lol >.<
[2:44:43] Sebleh: static is usually a signal issue @ikateyou whether it’s wired or wireless in this case it has both components
[2:45:06] Sebleh: @skeeld you want to put them around the boss near melee so tank can pick up adds
[2:45:08] tea2468: u make it look so easy!
[2:45:16] Guilleeee: @skeeld you drop them where the orbs are coming so that the mobs spawn and the orbs dont reach the boss

[3:08:24] skeeld: @Sebleh but i like the sound of my voice SadgeCry
[3:08:36] ikateyou: im the same way, noise cancelling makes me paranoid that i won't hear someone break into my house or smtn
[3:08:58] Sebleh: well no I’m saying it’s better to be able to hear yourself speak when you have to speak so your voice doesn’t sound all muffled to yourself
[3:09:02] Sebleh: @skeeld
[3:09:02] wicked_baboon: @ikateyou lock the door xD
[3:09:03] WckdSick: How bad is it for boomies to not have the Waning Twilight talent in the raid scenario? @Naguura
[3:09:13] silberquell: noise cancelling is so nice when you need to concentrate on something for a longer time, so you wont get distracted

[3:09:34] Kuroz: naguuraLove naguuraLove naguuraLove
[3:09:36] Sebleh: considering you’re only hitting one target and waning gives you 8% damage so you’re literally losing out on that whole buff
[3:09:39] MitcheyRoo: tune into stream boomkin is dead - name a better duo
[3:09:46] Tayyun: the new airpods pro 2 function with adaptive audio is very nice actually. Just cancel out the loud stuff
[3:10:06] WckdSick: @Sebleh I see, thank you for explaining to me :3
[3:10:10] Sebleh: yeah makes sense. you don’t need noise cancelling.
[3:10:45] Sebleh: @wckdsick what I mean is that waning should basically have like 99% uptime in a raid fight so dropping it is not a good idea
[3:10:49] silberquell: @Sebleh People who work with more than one colleague in the same room definetly needs it KEKW
[3:10:50] Zapzoda: yeah. that’s why AirPods are nice. you can turn the noise cancelling on and off

[3:48:50] StephixOne: Yes, it's kinda bullshit
[3:48:50] suras1331: agree
[3:48:51] Andersonmps: I agree
[3:48:58] Arthars: yea we r fucked this season i had to retiure my UDK for BM hunter @Naguura T_T
[3:49:01] JohnAllenCasts: ok but also evoker outrage where?
[3:49:02] StephixOne: They should've all been at the top, a few % ahead, rather than mostly dog
[3:49:05] Andersonmps: 100% true
[3:49:17] AceReformed: Because blizzard still thinks target capping for melee is the way to go, but then keep it uncapped for classes like DH YEP @Naguura
[3:49:17] DaBerry573: yea and i dont even play a leggo class
[3:49:18] amunahe: @Kuroz sadge, but ok:) i need a german boomie who is doing coaching, not so easy to find:)
[3:49:20] suras1331: they should be at or near the top
[3:49:21] StephixOne: They shouldn't be 20% ahead, but also not .. bottom half
[3:49:23] Arthars: they should never have to balance our classes cos of the leggo
[3:49:23] Andersonmps: Its a legendary.
[3:49:27] kobe53: u cannot build the endgame dps for a spec based on getting RNG leggo.....
[3:49:30] Darklott: class tuning with  legendary is just rough becuae you cant really get it right
[3:49:43] FareweII_: outside of pala plate classes have shit utility too. meanwhile a mage has everything PLUS damage
[3:49:49] Plonkz: blood DK doing the least damage of all tanks, even with legendary feels realy bad tbh
[3:49:50] Mallilion: What does it say about the status of the classes that can use it and dont have it?
[3:50:19] Andersonmps: If the legendary is the differencial i think its ok.
[3:50:21] maacfroza_: when do you hold or send pulsar proc?
[3:50:33] AceReformed: I mean the plate classes struggle not because of the legendary, it is because they have dogshit design for M+, classes like ret need to sacrifice either huge aoe or huge ST, and with the exception of DK, all the other plates are hard target capped Shruge leggo could be 100% stronger and they'd still not compete @Naguura
[3:50:35] Andersonmps: Legendary isnt that easy to get
[3:50:36] Archiduss: The only legendary I ever obtained during regular content was Atiesh back in Vanilla WoW. But then 1 week later TBC prepatch happened. So never could enjoy it properly. Don't even remember if it made me OP. :D
[3:50:46] bigmac4911: Arms warrior with the legendary here. Can confirm feels bad
[3:50:50] StreamElements: For Highlights, fun content and guides, remember to subscribe to my youtube channel -> https://www.youtube.com/naguura
[3:51:12] Andersonmps: All str melee are bottom of the list rn
[3:51:22] Delebriel: Season 4 probably can have this effect. How the balance will work out with multiple legendaries / special weapons (evoker leggo, devastation staff, raszageth bow, etc.)
[3:51:49] Celissah: Whats the point of legendary now when it's so "easy" to get.
[3:51:52] AceReformed: I mean they arent designed KEKW that is the problem
[3:52:04] AceReformed: Like I said, legendary could be twice as powerful and no one will take a platewearer
[3:52:07] Archiduss: I don't like how current legendaries make you farm a lot after though. And cost a lot of gold. That's a bad trend imo.
[3:52:08] AceReformed: It's the class design that is bad for M+
[3:52:11] TJCr3am: DK dps is just in a rough spot. Probably after ret rework and DH rework people just play those classes. I played dk but completely abandond them I dont even bother getting the lego cause the class is just bad in mostly everything. We only have grip and 0 utility really :(
[3:52:24] AlptugY: @Kuroz i get naguuras suf but i cant get party bars do you know why
[3:52:34] Kuroz: @AlptugY do you have grid2?
[3:52:39] Kuroz: those aren't from suf
[3:52:45] Celissah: @Naguura I would rather let legendary be foking super rare.
[3:52:45] Darklott: eitehr make legendaries like in MoP or WoD or just dont have them
[3:52:57] jentoruu: @TJCr3am kek
[3:53:18] Andersonmps: I think they shouldn't be way ahead of the others, but also not bottom half

[3:55:28] Kuroz: naguuraLove naguuraLove naguuraLove
[3:55:36] Archiduss: I cleared heroic every week after world first. Didnt get Axe yet. :P
[3:55:45] Archiduss: Copium
[3:55:48] Kuroz: now you technically still have time for a key Chatting  since you called it early
[3:55:50] StreamElements: For Highlights, fun content and guides, remember to subscribe to my youtube channel -> https://www.youtube.com/naguura
[3:55:58] Darklott: its cool to have them imo but not when they are bis for practically everyone that can wear it
[3:56:48] StephixOne: @Darklott Would it be better to have a legendary possibly drop for you but be SO bad that you don't wanna use it? What kind of logic is that? Or are you talking about the very rare items
[3:57:00] Andersonmps: And the axe is still too expensive. I think they shouldnt make legendary profession related
[3:57:24] Andersonmps: (you still need a rise tho)
[3:57:28] hackiii: catJAM
[3:57:43] StephixOne: Rise worst dungeon this season imo too
[3:58:01] Tasviati: @Andersonmps is it better than the absolute time sink smourne was/is in wotlk classic?
[3:58:15] Darklott: @Darklott I meant rare drops
[3:58:34] StephixOne: @Darklott Gotcha. They're not always gigabis for everyone though, not ever class wanted the Nelth trinkets for example
[3:58:44] Andersonmps: @Andersonmps I preffer the time sink over the gold sink
[3:58:45] Archiduss: Legendaries like BFA Cloak and Legion Weapons are pretty cool. Like everyone gets one.
[3:58:48] StephixOne: Some of the other very rare items this tier are _good_ on most people too, but not like a huge boon
[3:59:23] Archiduss: Tanks used thunderfury even in TBC
[3:59:25] skeeld: gavel should have been a legendary 👀
[3:59:25] breaccglas123: What do you think about the affixes of the next reset? (Sanguine and incorporeal) Time to play a different game?
[3:59:39] skeeld: they should do legendaries like gw2
[3:59:49] Andersonmps: i remember my sweet old Shadowmorne days
[3:59:50] skeeld: in gw2 they're really pretty particle effects plus quality of life
[3:59:53] mitoxcarry: dh broke your roots with seal
[4:00:08] StephixOne: Legendaries should put you up in damage but also maybe change gameplay a bit in some really cool way?
[4:00:13] Darklott: @StephixOne I just think its kinda annoying when you have something like Icon that was super good for pretty much everyone and every single spec can roll on them
[4:00:21] StephixOne: @Darklott True
[4:00:27] skeeld: i dont think they should be a direct upgrade because gettingf them its so bs
[4:00:35] Andersonmps: But that defeats the purpose of an item being legendary
[4:00:39] mitoxcarry: no problem. we will push again our key LUL
[4:00:39] skeeld: like i tried for the dk leggo for like 2 months
[4:00:42] skeeld: and now i just dgaf anymore
[4:00:50] StreamElements: For Highlights, fun content and guides, remember to subscribe to my youtube channel -> https://www.youtube.com/naguura
[4:00:52] skeeld: i only got the evoker leggo because its my main
[4:00:54] MitssORLY: the axe is actually not rare enough i feel like
[4:01:00] MitssORLY: it should have lower drop rate
[4:01:01] JohnAllenCasts: I wonder how true that is for the majority of the player base though
[4:01:09] DaBerry573: why should rarity really matter at all tho
[4:01:12] jork0209: !UI

[4:01:14] JohnAllenCasts: like what % of the population is actually purple decked
[4:01:31] StephixOne: @JohnAllenCasts Everyone? Doesn't M0 drop epics?
[4:01:31] AceReformed: Imo, MoP / WoD legendaries where the best, long quest chains that build up an item, accumulating into a legendary on the last patch, much like FF14s relic weapons, this entire RNG dropfest + goldsink is entirely in place because people have to pay more money Shruge @Naguura
[4:01:43] StephixOne: Heck, the welfare catchup items you get from doing stuff in the Emerald Dream are Epics
[4:02:07] Andersonmps: @AceReformed 100% agree
[4:02:27] StephixOne: who's Rarity
[4:02:51] the_inhumanatee: I feel thats true for a very small population, I just wanna pump
[4:02:54] Lantash: I do it for the looks, not the rarity
[4:03:02] DaBerry573: yeah im doing it for the power not the rarity
[4:03:13] cr4zin: I feel like legendaries should be like the helm enchant.  Then atleast everyone can have access to it.

[4:05:11] Rubus: cool drip
[4:05:23] the_inhumanatee: the casuals would riot @Naguura
[4:05:28] StephixOne: I don't think we can go back to the caché of epics from back in vanilla anymore tbh
[4:05:36] StephixOne: So who cares at this point
[4:05:48] Andersonmps: But then that would make the casuals miserable
[4:05:50] StreamElements: For Highlights, fun content and guides, remember to subscribe to my youtube channel -> https://www.youtube.com/naguura
[4:05:54] skeeld: why did thatr player just scream yahoo
[4:05:59] StephixOne: Give it 3 xpacs and every slot is legendary then legendary-legendaries are uber-legendaries slootKEKW
[4:06:04] bloodtvx: maybe keep them the same color, but add like a bronze silver or gold frame depending on the rarity
[4:06:09] Kahlandra: yeah this would have the opposite effect and make others feel bad
[4:06:13] Kahlandra: thats probably why everything is purple
[4:06:45] dwinftw: i hate this dungeon
[4:06:57] StephixOne: Naguura loves it
[4:07:01] Andersonmps: To me the color only matter when is orange
[4:07:24] cmonineedanickname: lower is alright... upper is just pain
[4:07:49] skeeld: wants techno, then complains about techno
[4:08:00] VipMalis: in vanilla you had green from world content, blue from dungeon and purple from raid, with few rare exceptions but everyone wanted purplz
[4:08:15] StephixOne: tell us already

[4:14:02] Andersonmps: That was amazing
[4:14:03] Toadcop: i love kings rest
[4:14:16] Darklott: the best dungeon is big pull dungeons
[4:14:21] Darklott: unless its bolstering everbloom
[4:14:22] TotallyNotRaien: shadowmoon was just kinda boring in general
[4:14:33] Giggleshake: Those people just want a quick weekly key. So CoS and Shadowmoon were so nice for that
[4:14:41] Toadcop: bfa dungeons had the best design
[4:14:41] Giggleshake: I'm a vault filler and the easier the better

[4:14:48] deinueberheld: guten abend
[4:14:48] Andersonmps: Rise is pretty linear too. But is fucked up
[4:14:52] sim967: I like path options in dungeons
[4:15:04] LtJenkins: Halls of infusion was a big ole yuck. Mostly linear, hard, and you're often spending almost 40 minutes in there to find out if you fail.
[4:15:10] stormyweatherr: vault fillers ICANT
[4:15:11] skeeld: i dont even need vaults on my main anymore

[4:15:25] StephixOne: "Just quit", says top streamer
[4:15:28] TotallyNotRaien: they probably arent even doing pvp to fully fill their vaults either... posers
[4:15:30] skeeld: honestly just learning the class is the fun party
[4:15:40] AceReformed: @StephixOne Trust me she'd be gone years ago if she could not play wow
[4:15:44] stormyweatherr: they dress them up, its like adult barbie dolls i guess. idk
[4:15:45] Toadcop: thats why m+ is the only logical end game content well maybe pvp
[4:15:48] ohhkaleyeah: i'm deleting the game
[4:15:48] skeeld: wow classes are really intricate and fun to learn imo

[4:18:49] Toadcop: to compensate
[4:18:52] Toadcop: or 5
[4:18:58] Giggleshake: being hungover is the best part, its an excuse to not do anything till you're alive again
[4:19:08] TotallyNotRaien: lord google says theres some research that says it can lessen the effects of hang overs
[4:19:08] StephixOne: 5? rookie numbers, 7-8L or bust
[4:19:09] AceReformed: Drink water no hangover, or, drink water and no alcohol, also no hungerover KEKW @Naguura
[4:19:10] Evcon_: u drink water after u turn it into coffee. u cant fool us
[4:19:24] Darklott: @Giggleshake only downside is that you also dont want to be alive
[4:19:26] skeeld: i got home saturday at 2 am, had water, a meal, water again, then went to bed

[4:41:46] TotallyNotRaien: this drama was so lame tho.. im used to beauty community drama with literal crimes and all being committed
[4:41:51] ace50: Lil bro reacting before the point of the drama even starting
[4:42:01] ikateyou: lmao don't click the video if you don't want a reaction
[4:42:05] UncleJemima71: reactception
[4:42:18] calmuz96: but he’s overreacting to it 🤣 people can have a little spat without it being reacted to
[4:42:23] StephixOne: It just feels like he pauses any short clip 412 times to hear himself talk
[4:42:23] thebunten: KEKW
[4:42:27] StephixOne: But hey, that's my take on his videos
[4:42:29] StephixOne: You can have yours
[4:42:32] Andersonmps: I think ppl dont understand the concept of reaction
[4:42:36] Starforkx: @TotallyNotRaien it's all that's happening right now, they (max and whoever) mention that when i think growl jumps in
[4:42:38] fennrirq: maybe they mean Italian reacting with gestures only KEKHeim

[4:44:02] calmuz96: @infraxtion HAHAHA but we came to listen to her
[4:44:40] ikateyou: for me, if a "reaction" if just them making faces and sounds it's boring
[4:44:46] Andersonmps: This whole "ideal amount of pauses on reactions" always cracks me up
[4:44:50] DaBerry573: i tuned into your stream to watch/listen to you and youre talking Madge
[4:44:53] sincitypersona: what r ur fav add ons for wow
[4:44:56] synically32: Just ignore them lol

[4:45:11] ace50: @andersonmps problematic if it can't wait more than every 15 seconds
[4:45:13] TotallyNotRaien: not really, just a petty squabble

[4:46:56] Kahlandra: we put people on pedestals and look to tear them down
[4:47:06] kappakappalores: serve us the tea
[4:47:08] Starforkx: @calmuz96 that's not reacting though, sure it allows you to process the information in a more "full" view, but that defeats the purpose of reacting
[4:47:15] burlemarx: naguraa goin full non non verbal
[4:47:22] UncleJemima71: nothing bad happened from the overlap, they started dying because of the tank
[4:47:27] UncleJemima71: so he 100% overreacted
[4:47:28] TotallyNotRaien: shes always non non verbal lol
