[1:50:54] DefileMeElmo: I never understood the desire to collect cards. Not saying it's bad but any means, as everyone has a hobby. It's just one of those things I don't understand the appeal.
[1:51:10] sgtswoll: Last night I joined a 20 azure vault and the tank pulled the lashers and tree into the first room with the whelp patrolling and while kiting away from the sanguine he ran right into the welp and then we wiped and he (the tank that caused the whole thing) left and so the poor guys 20 key rip in >1 min
[1:51:29] DefileMeElmo: That makes a little more sense

[2:09:31] lirly__: decent nameplate will show you what priority the spell is to interuupt
[2:09:57] Nokterian: LUL
[2:10:26] DBtheAlien: @poggz__one is that what it‚Äôs called is decent nameplate? I have been using threatplates. I know how to interrupt and all that I just never know which enemy casts I‚Äôm supposed to do it on lol

[2:11:46] Mecabeast: I snagged atrocities profile and modified the colors a bit
[2:11:47] Provision_: idk why anyone else would mark outside of tank
[2:11:47] Sandisy: prio built into the weakaura I think. tanks usually take prio marking
[2:12:19] lirly__: @DBtheAlien i meant a decent profile, so it will show red for high prio, green for mid, grey for cc, etc
[2:12:52] propoopimus: that visual change makes it so much easier to dodge
[2:12:56] DBtheAlien: Ahhh, maybe I need to see how threatplates does that, if at all.
[2:13:01] Nokterian: im using growl WA because i heal

[2:15:18] Mecabeast: @austinoranje fresh 70 rogue I just wanted the vault option
[2:15:34] Molvonos: You coulda farmed a few dirts/packs and got the 10ish you got
[2:15:43] AustinOranje: lol @molvonos prob

[2:17:15] Mecabeast: I'm bad at using health stones
[2:17:19] GoodGuyHeliioz: That‚Äôs annoying when that‚Äôs the case
[2:17:30] GoodGuyHeliioz: They don‚Äôt use personals
[2:17:36] inj0shwetrust: Yeah but there are encounters that as of now.  If you dont use personal def cds during some levels in raid encounter..... you cant live through it.
[2:17:48] stealthx23: they got a aoe heal lol

[2:20:37] Molvonos: Only thing I hated about BFA were mechagnomes.
[2:20:42] ravenwingz0405: islands were SO much fun!
[2:20:42] Molvonos: Fuck mechagnomes.
[2:20:46] Sarocus: BfA is one of my favorites, for sure
[2:20:51] Aquadriel: only raiders didnt like it because they were "forced" to grind.
[2:21:02] Sollice: BfA had one of my favorite dungeons ever in that haunted manor one

[2:21:49] PandaPops93: no i mean if you got that corruption
[2:21:52] Specsifier: always? I quit because I couldn't get things to drop in BFA without putting in 6 days a week
[2:21:56] PandaPops93: until they let you buy it
[2:22:14] Aquadriel: @Towelliee Twilight devastation in the same patch as awakened affix, best patch ever
[2:22:26] EmpathyLiveChat: I liked Atal Dazar
[2:22:35] PvtHudson093: but gated behind PVP
[2:22:50] Molvonos: You had to work on your Neck, you had to work on your cloak, you had to work on your essences.
[2:22:59] Molvonos: There was so much to work on if you came in late
[2:23:00] barakasgrim: Atal Dazar was a ragequit fest
[2:23:00] wEiRdO_dUdE: Yeah, the essences themselves were cool, but it got awful with implementation
[2:23:06] LoremasterMarthan: Yea thats where I was at - came back in at the end and basically had to grind all of the 8.2 and 8.3 content at the same time just to catch up with stuff
[2:23:14] inj0shwetrust: The wolves truck man
[2:23:24] slickbriick: I joined BFA at the end and the catch up was never ending. The cloak also took forever!
[2:23:32] RogueBear: still too early to determine something like that
[2:23:33] thecynicalshuffler: the corruption vendor should have been in from the start of the corruption system
[2:23:49] RogueBear: a lot can happen in an expansion
[2:23:50] 0doz: do we have more raids this year??
[2:23:58] Sollice: @0doz of course, 3 more i think
[2:23:59] Reckless_Monk: ease of alt gearing will make people play more than BFA
[2:24:07] PvtHudson093: and the corruption vendor shouldnt have a rotation
[2:24:11] DBtheAlien: @barakasgrim hell people still rage quit that one lol
[2:24:12] 0doz: nice
[2:24:12] wEiRdO_dUdE: And then things like the corruption vendor were just WTF
[2:24:31] sgtswoll: I have been playing since vanilla and besides vanilla(I was a high school student and college student during that time) I have never played a xpac more than shadowlands believe it or not haha
[2:24:35] Reckless_Monk: heeitage armor
[2:24:40] faulen: you had to pull an extra pack in the hall yesterday. you need 84% before going up.
[2:24:46] WhiteKnight74648: Good Morning!

[2:26:37] LoremasterMarthan: Im still the most excited for the assumed chromie time stuff for .2
[2:26:39] Molvonos: I think we're gonna cleanse Nozdormu personally.  I think that's gonna be a big patch storyline.
[2:26:42] Molvonos: Calling it here first
[2:26:43] inj0shwetrust: Yeah I assumed Noz would be a raid boss at the very least after the Thald questline
[2:27:20] tawney_owl_: Its never made any sense to me why the hell any of the mortal races would help the primalists, like ah yes im going to betray all my kinsmen and destroy the world i live on because a couple of dragons are grumpy about a fued older than my ancestors ancestors
[2:27:25] thecynicalshuffler: N'zoth will come back but in a twist he will be revealed to be trying to help save the universe from the light and we will team up with the old gods against the light and the titans...lol
[2:27:25] Sollice: @Towelliee They also had new whispers in there so its not like the same old whispers either
[2:27:39] LoremasterMarthan: We really are just doing the Endgame story arent we lol
[2:27:47] Snabido: I guess, allowing the main timeline to split in order to save Noz while creating Murozond? ü§î
[2:27:53] elstefanodgh: So what class are you going to main now towelliee?
[2:28:01] Molvonos: N'Zoth's gonna come back as one of those thick-thighed goblin girls along with Knifu, and we've all seen enough hentai to know where that's going.
[2:28:28] HEIZALL: :)

[2:28:54] TacDuc: I am pretty sure he knew when we fought him in BfA, as he pretty much just gave us the only weapon that could kill us
[2:28:58] TacDuc: Him
[2:29:03] LoseAlotLuke: wait till we find out Kang is the leader of the void lords @Towelliee
[2:29:13] RogueBear: we have to bring back the jailer to fight N'zoth! Kappa

[2:29:52] Molvonos: lol.  'Sargeras: 'You don't know what's coming.' Zovaal: 'You don't know what's coming.' 'Chromie: 'I know what's coming, teehee'
[2:30:28] TacDuc: @LoremasterMarthan With what? Covering his nipples? Or killing himself?
[2:30:46] Molvonos: He created the Lich King and Sargeras.
[2:30:48] LoremasterMarthan: He can cut diamonds with those nips how dare LUL
[2:30:48] WhiteKnight74648: We go back in time to help the jailor and fight our 25 man raid that defeated him.
[2:31:00] WhiteKnight74648: so its a 25 man vs a 25 man raid POGGERS
[2:31:00] HeavyMetta: never forget Blizz has a redemption fetish

[2:31:21] LoseAlotLuke: shes evil
[2:31:23] Sollice: I dont think they are suppose to
[2:31:27] Ardailec: She can't tell what is past and present
[2:31:30] Reckless_Monk: Nozdormu is just an Aspect of Time
[2:31:31] EmpathyLiveChat: She could tell us, but then she'd have to kill us
[2:31:36] TacDuc: Chromie was busy sending us back to the past expansions
[2:31:40] inj0shwetrust: I think there is a unwritten law with that type of stuff where they cant unviel that info
[2:31:42] abracka_: could fuck up the time space continuum
[2:31:53] bawheid: that's next expac
[2:32:08] Molvonos: Chromie is like Lovecraft's Azathoth.  Omnipotent but fucking stupid.
[2:32:18] inj0shwetrust: Like how Dr Strange knew Tony Stark would die, but couldnt tell him that.  Cause Tony would have veered off that path trying to avoid it had he know.
[2:32:19] Mecabeast: there's alo bound to be drama within alliance leadership because of anduins absence
[2:32:25] Mecabeast: also*
[2:33:07] TacDuc: I can't abandon replenishing the reservoir from SL, so I have to go back and turn it it...
[2:33:56] WhiteKnight74648: Maybe we have you use our dragon to go 88 MPH to go back in time.
[2:33:56] Molvonos: So far, imo, they're doing the timetravel thing right.  People might bitch about WoD, but they've had Timetravel since Vanilla, it's not exactly an asspull.

[2:34:27] arturiuss44: n'zoth pulled a voldermort and placed part of himself inside us so he can never die.
[2:34:35] Mecabeast: mother* holy shit I can't type today
[2:34:42] MVPOFURGAMES: cracked gameplay
[2:34:43] nevercluckyy: a corrupted chromie boss fight would be pretty dope though at certain stages of the fight rewind time and make you fight through different old god era's of wow to uncorrupt her
[2:34:44] clambynature: @Molvonos ahh
[2:35:04] TacDuc: N'Zoth is pretty smart, I wouldn't even be surprised if he was the strongest of the Old Gods, but without letting anyone know, just because he knew what might happen in the future. He is the one that has corrupted pretty much every major enemy in the game
[2:35:08] Molvonos: @clambynature The ice fish can also be thawed and left to 'rot' for Elemental decay and a chance for Darkmoon cards.
[2:35:18] Molvonos: While Magma fish can be smashed by jewelers for gems
[2:35:39] Molvonos: And I *think* the prismatic fish from the highland pools can be smashed by Inscriptionists for ink
[2:35:54] Molvonos: So, multiple purposes.
[2:36:11] WhiteKnight74648: EZ Clap
[2:36:17] Molvonos: Eye of Skoval
[2:36:30] inj0shwetrust: The Shoulders!
[2:36:35] infektyd: horn of valor is dps loot table only?
[2:36:38] infektyd: i thought...
[2:36:56] inj0shwetrust: Ive ran that dungeon so many times on shadow priest for them never once seen them
[2:37:09] Snabido: It's a vers + on use main stat, so it shouldnt?

[2:37:10] cptrogers123: crafted items is basically legendaries all over again ResidentSleeper
[2:37:23] yokai_5: hope the disc priest buff is good
[2:37:23] Ardailec: Got mine with Blood specc
[2:37:38] infektyd: id check, because i know one of the better tank trinkets is on the dps loot table
[2:37:40] TacDuc: I love the crafting system, and the items.
[2:37:45] infektyd: ok, it was whetstone than
[2:37:47] Molvonos: Eye/Horn def don't appear on healer tables
[2:37:48] tr4ncetv: crafting is confusing, but nothign bad with being able to craft some good items.
[2:37:49] wEiRdO_dUdE: The crafted gear is optional
[2:37:50] Maruika: crafting is fine, helps casuals a ton
[2:37:57] WhiteKnight74648: Did you need a key?
[2:38:06] ac1dburn395: watch guzzling on?
[2:38:07] Provision_: How it legendary if you can already have 4 crafted items LUL
[2:38:12] Orczeus: professiosn in wow is still not as BAD as new world @Towelliee
[2:38:14] WhiteKnight74648: bajG
[2:38:14] cptrogers123: They just need some catch up
[2:38:16] Mecabeast: leg3ndaries were only bad in SL cause of how many lower tier needed crafted to make a higher tier piece
[2:38:24] cptrogers123: Warrior S tier now btw Pog
[2:38:27] Aquadriel: crafting right now is flawed since theres no way to lvl past 60 if you dont get work orders, which barely anyone does
[2:38:27] Molvonos: Yooo, I got my ADV.gg gummies.  Tumeric gummies are fucking harsh
[2:38:53] Coleson54: !ui

[2:38:57] Provision_: @innerkindd how it need catch up? You do 4 quests get the spark and get items crafted
[2:39:27] faulen: such a good change
[2:39:28] lirly__: pathetic
[2:39:51] cptrogers123: @Provision_ to get it 418, you need to get 10 concentrated primal focus. the way to get that is doing +16s and mythic bosses
[2:39:54] cptrogers123: thats bad design
[2:40:04] yokai_5: thundering is awful true
[2:40:09] tawney_owl_: not as bad as infested or beguiling
[2:40:15] wEiRdO_dUdE: Yay salty comments
[2:40:15] Wcvechten: Still dislike Infested more, but it's close
[2:40:16] Mecabeast: thundering should be clear for dps increase imo
[2:40:16] Snabido: Infested was better üòè
[2:40:27] PvtHudson093: you think its worse than Infested?
[2:40:28] Nokterian: HELL NAH
[2:40:30] lirly__: its boring and poorly thought out
[2:40:31] Provision_: @innerkindd well why would you be getting 418 without doing that content?
[2:40:32] yokai_5: thundering is a nightmare with pugs
[2:40:42] jerseyfive: don't worry the next one will be even worse LUL
[2:40:43] SilkeySmooth: so much for blizzard lsitning
[2:40:52] Nokterian: I liked S3 and S4 affix in SL
[2:41:33] cptrogers123: @Provision_ well im not talking about myself, more about the casual players
[2:41:48] Snabido: How about make it appear every 10% or something, perhaps that will lessen the impact LUL
[2:42:06] Provision_: @innerkindd well casuals would not be 400+ ilvl to begin with. Why would they need access to 418?
[2:42:10] jerseyfive: most time is a huge dmg lose because people are running around like headless chickens
[2:42:15] NoWaayMan: if the affix ruins a key for you its not the affix
[2:42:18] Lostdogal: 100%
[2:42:23] warrenny: Some people think thier opinion is the only one and it‚Äôs ridiculous
[2:42:38] Lostdogal: Clear then a short DPS buff fixes it
[2:42:42] wEiRdO_dUdE: AWC was EU yesterday, it's NA today
[2:42:43] faulen: yeah it was hyped for sure on twitch

[2:46:00] Goosemantm: towelliee is cute

[2:54:05] Lostdogal: just a bit, yeah
[2:54:06] wEiRdO_dUdE: I haven't seen the numbers but they are probably massively skewed toward prot warrior as a % of all tanks
[2:54:08] fewyn: LUL
[2:54:12] TacDuc: Warrior only has two places, at the top or at the bottom
[2:54:14] Sayryn: Where is the bingo
[2:54:14] myfunkyself: OMG
[2:54:14] WhiteKnight74648: Captain Obvious is strong
[2:54:15] SilkeySmooth: so the devs had their fill of prot warriors?
[2:54:17] cptrogers123: but thats minor nerfs innit?
[2:54:27] Zandyre: Warriors deserved to be as powerful as they were considering what they did to them in SL.
[2:54:28] Nokterian: A bit...A BIT LUL

[2:55:33] thiccsushi: Which tank needs to be juiced up?
[2:55:39] SilkeySmooth: balance is terrible in dragonflight
[2:55:43] Sayryn: Every tank has his 15 minutes in the sun. Druid in Legion etc.
[2:55:57] WoW_StandalonE: good blood DK healing is out of this world in mythic+
[2:56:07] Provision_: @traymann84 well DK and VDH can also keep themselve up. Just Prot you take no damage with ignore pain

[2:56:44] kappaday23: Kappa
[2:56:46] sgtswoll: Druid hasn‚Äôt been good since legion now. In fact they have basically been bottom of the barrel since legion.
[2:56:50] wEiRdO_dUdE: Basically this will help to counter the massive damage bursting going on in PvP
[2:56:55] Mayorbeeohyayy: Any buff for monks?
[2:56:56] sgtswoll: Guardian that is
[2:56:56] MisterPeace: omg dk get increased heal in pvp lol

[2:57:00] traymann84: @Provision_ Yea...he either took no damage at all, or healed himself faster then i could do something. :D
[2:57:04] tocu: I htink Echos DK tank on mythic broodmother was 398 as it was a late swap week 1 but seemed much better week 2 for them

[2:58:04] Lostdogal: I havent seen a frost DK in the wild this whole expansion
[2:58:10] banishtyrion: "I remember we had some specs for DKs in that old Excel spreasheet ... "
[2:58:15] Molvonos: You know what Frost DK breath is good for?  Pulling adds.  It's the new Barrage.
[2:58:19] Provision_: they actually put thought into it. if good or bad is based on your opinion
[2:58:25] generaljosh721: They need to get rid of breath of sindragosa and make the spec not rely on your breath
[2:58:36] altair19992: wat ; DK is strong as hell ni raids KEKW
[2:58:37] Ardailec: @Lostdogal I tried to make 2H frost work for weeks. It's legit sad. Like 20k DPS below Unholy sad.

[3:02:05] wEiRdO_dUdE: I think survival got a little buff recently

[4:09:53] neverbornlucky: there was a nintendo game for NES that sold for huge dollar signs cause it was in package of retail
[4:10:01] tocu: The person looking to get a pricing on the game and the expert were friends .  that episode was 100% a scam not just a "reality TV"
[4:10:12] Jobbyjob: mario 64 9.8 sold for 1.6 mil i think in 2021
[4:10:13] Sweet_Lou__: His so called "experts" tho LMAO

[4:14:10] jerseyfive: thing is worth 1mill... 200$ is the best i can do
[4:14:12] tocu: They inflated the price as they were in bed with the Auction house like they are now owned by the same people.  The cost of grade at a certain price of the game is charged a % of the value so they were exploded their worth
[4:14:53] Rudric_Ice: pls giff dead mines m+
[4:14:57] Danielnworb: I've noticed a few high level Mythic+ players don't have their castbars enabled - do you know when you skills finish?

[4:21:38] tawney_owl_: @DrJenxx enhancment does insane dps in keys via windfury, their personal dps may not be top but they make everyone else so much stronger
[4:21:39] Ragetiger1: the issue is that the game, for the quest, doesn't have him listed as "being helped" so that old MoP quest cannot be completed for now
[4:22:13] BatDogee: just a bdk diff tbh
[4:22:40] BobLongMVP: @tawney_owl_ does WF totem affect mm hunter?

[4:34:56] Draz3nx: for dps
[4:35:04] Rudric_Ice: a job has to take you to get that said "experience"

[4:40:07] ArcaneMaki: Wasn't that group full 15 sec ago.
[4:40:08] thiccsushi: Toweliee isnt acting like an elitist its common practice

[4:40:43] Calibur84: We all don't want to waste time IO helps with that a ton
[4:40:46] Molvonos: Homie's been following for less than a month and he's claiming elitism without actually knowing?
[4:40:48] Calibur84: People suck
[4:40:51] thiccsushi: Plus he's the one tanking the key with his rat alts KEKW
[4:40:52] Molvonos: The fuck hot take is that?

[4:42:14] Molvonos: You called out Towelliee, not PEOPLE
[4:42:16] WhiteKnight74648: I would suggest doing that in the fortnite voice but i remembered no one under 30 plays this game anymore. Kappa
[4:42:16] Hybridwarhawk: for real for real
[4:42:17] Molvonos: The fuck?
[4:42:20] Masqerader: sounds like you're picking competent people.. you wouldn't hire a football player to perform brain surgery, sounds reasonable to me
[4:42:23] Molvonos: You're trolling?
[4:42:23] xReadyAimMissx: I rarely play, but even I use the raider io addon, so people know I'm trash. KEKWlaugh @Towelliee

[4:43:14] sgtswoll: Personally I am a father of 2 and married with a full time job. I also push higher keys on my free time but obviously don‚Äôt have a ton of time to do so. Raiderio Addons help me be more useful with the time I have to play the game and push content with like minded players.

[6:31:48] tr4ncetv: it's a sport that's "fun" for the family, per dana
[6:31:54] Stoops21: they can get paid. just no insurance
[6:32:15] NewWorldReign: Lets just say, if you can handle a hard slap you win the game.
[6:32:21] tr4ncetv: oh, it's the stupid slap 1v1 thing.
[6:32:30] tyler2tall89: stoked for the fights tonight
[6:32:42] NewWorldReign: @tr4ncetv got it LUL

[6:33:19] tr4ncetv: CTE speed run
[6:33:41] tyler2tall89: I'd rather jump in the cage with Jon Jones over doing that slap boxing shit
[6:34:01] manmower: the slap stuff is more dangerous than UFC
[6:34:13] manmower: look at where they hit
[6:34:15] tr4ncetv: definitely

[6:35:35] tyler2tall89: no thanks
[6:35:35] Nokterian: monkaW
[6:35:37] Codex_Tsu: Thor, The Mountain, is a pretty nonviolent dude these days.
[6:35:40] Pups_Gersky: The Big Show would so do it.
[6:35:44] tyler2tall89: remove you head from your shoulders
[6:35:52] Jarlan23: like half a round in and their gassed
[6:35:53] manmower: yea big dudes are bad fighters
[6:36:07] GingerGambit: im sure theres weight classes
[6:36:34] Admiller0: @Towelliee there a vod of you talking about tank changes by chance??
[6:36:38] UtherBrexton: based on ring size
[6:36:42] Nokterian: Payge for Slap
[6:36:47] tyler2tall89: @manmower I mean, not as fast paced, but Iwouldnt say "bad"
[6:36:51] manmower: open freestyle, no weight class, no gender class
[6:36:54] daconcion: Yeah, weight class 1 goes from 101-200, weight class 2 is from 201-300
[6:37:19] 3663Sharad: D:
[6:37:20] Admiller0: was just curious of thoughts on brm buffs :)
[6:37:22] tyler2tall89: how is brewmaster now?
[6:37:23] Dankind64: oh no PepeHands nerfs inc?
[6:37:25] Sylphy_TV: KEKW
[6:37:28] NewWorldReign: a dude had to be stretchered off because he suffered brain damage as a result from a full slap.
[6:37:29] GingerGambit: People are saying the tank nerf is like a 3% damage reduction nerf
[6:37:34] Sutekiii: hey ya'll, how is ret right now?
[6:37:36] 3663Sharad: How it should be. Perfectly balanced EZ
[6:37:46] neveranyluck: i mean they never claimed to be smart
[6:37:55] Squid1030: what about rogue? Outlaw getting the nerf bat
[6:38:01] Codex_Tsu: Should probably just buff the rest of the tanks to be closer rather than nerfing warrior then.
[6:38:04] Dankind64: i wish they would continue with the "buff everyone else" strat of balance
[6:38:07] BlueBlurPrime: just buff the other tanks, problem solved
[6:38:08] manmower: they're just bringing the other tanks up instead
[6:38:32] NewWorldReign: Are BM monks still glass cannons as tank? @Towelliee
[6:38:41] BobLongMVP: can I visit one of my alts' garrison? is there a way?

[6:38:48] lowgarr: hey every dungeon I go in hunters are insane
[6:39:08] lowgarr: anyone else experiencing that
[6:39:21] GingerGambit: far more gear dependent
[6:39:43] Codex_Tsu: That micromanaging would be fine if it was rewarded. It feels like more work for inferior damage mitigation.
[6:39:44] NewWorldReign: I guess BM's so going to be extra nerfed this expansion
[6:40:04] shimwood: They need more birbs
[6:40:11] Exxcar: Heya @Towelliee towHAMUP
[6:40:11] Sylphy_TV: First Entry of how to Tune Monk: Do you know Quantum Physics pepeMeltdown
[6:40:14] Weirdsliceofbread: @Towelliee how is your dragon auras on above rather than above the action bars? What addons do u use for that?
[6:40:44] JaeDee: They will nerf damage for tankness?
[6:40:47] shimwood: @Weirdsliceofbread You can move it in Edit Mode
[6:40:54] Peqdevil: My guild has a Brewmaster, finds the others on the boring side
[6:40:55] manmower: alt-modifiers
[6:41:12] Weirdsliceofbread: @Weirdsliceofbread ah i see so i dont need teh addon then
[6:41:30] tC_Jeff: it just needs a redesign. Warrior is so strong just because of the design. they can nerf the abilities all they want it doesnt really effect warrior
[6:41:47] shimwood: Nope, just make sure you're on your dragon when you go into Edit Mode

[6:42:16] Codex_Tsu: Monk has lost a lot from the expansion reworks, so, yeah, it probably does just need a minor rework again.
[6:43:08] manmower: compare dmg taken between the tanks
[6:43:35] manmower: should just try to make the other specs like that
[6:44:41] happybooger: somewhat fixed
