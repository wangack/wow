[6:45:58] DigitalZonez: thats upsetting. been a huge fan of fury warrior since panda and cant play any other spec
[6:46:11] EggWrath: @DigitalZonez fury warr w/ 4 set bonus MAYBE  gonna be better than arms, but so far alot of high level arms are playing it
[6:47:26] Fabst3r8: So arms for pvp and fury for pve maybe?
[6:47:48] EggWrath: @DigitalZonez i think this patch will be the best spot for fury warr pvp in quite a while. it's always been overshadowed by arms because of how bad crit is in pvp
[6:47:57] EggWrath: but fury is highly playable in pvp at this time
[6:47:57] elipzer1337: : Hi swifty i just came back to shadowlands after 2 year ish break due to classic and tbc, any advice? just got my mage 60 tonight

[6:50:08] EggWrath: @Swifty 2-Set - Raging Blow deals 15% increased damage and gains an additional charge. 4-Set - Raging Blow has a 20% chance to grant Recklessness for 4 sec. The four piece bonus causes Bloodbath and Crushing Blow to become available when Reckless Abandon is talented, but does not generate extra rage.

[6:53:35] EggWrath: @DigitalZonez play stormrage if alliance, play Area52 or Illidan as horde. in 9.2.5 they're bringing crossfaction to the game for m+/arena/raid, BUT guilds are not crossfaction, so playing on a high population guild based on ur faction is still relevant
[6:53:39] DigitalZonez: i believe
[6:53:43] barbellz_unchained: turn right

[7:21:06] originaladdict: help! how did he grat those upgrades exactly?
[7:21:24] TheEndIsNear777: you can get cosmic flux from pvp too, this is good news!
[7:21:24] Galdrena: cosmic flux
[7:21:31] TheEndIsNear777: I might farm my 1st legendary now
[7:21:31] EggWrath: @saltvann1 not as much as prior seasons no. At this point in the patch, you only need to grind dailies and rep in one zone. Outside of that, m+/raid/pvp, and nothing else matters in terms of player power.
[7:21:35] Racyinnuendos: ahh so we have to farm the cosmic flaux to do it then?
[7:21:49] kamazila2021: hi go oneshot macro bro)

[7:24:22] jnotex: Avatar reduces the cooldown on thunder clap no?
[7:24:36] ysbear: experimnets over ;(
[7:25:28] kamazila2021: go duel )
[7:26:09] EggWrath: into the fray might only work well against demo
[7:26:27] EggWrath: not consistent enough to be surrounded by enemies in melee range outside of m+
[7:27:52] ysbear: its capped at 4.5 seconds..
[7:28:01] EggWrath: the good news is that the legendary works - talents are swappable in games :D

[7:28:56] ysbear: iit is capped
[7:29:08] EggWrath: its 4.5 seconds shorter PER thunderclap
[7:29:21] EggWrath: so it gets max effectiveness if you hit 3 targets per thunderclap
[7:29:25] Yikitiz: they mean the cap on how much you reset per thunder clap is 4.5
[7:29:26] StreamElements: Redeem Points at point store https://streamelements.com/swifty/store

[7:45:41] Shalyon: maybe u can try ur paladin
[7:45:47] therealrecktd: damn that spriest was a freak
[7:45:53] Teagens: I dont know what class I want to focus on playing for PVP
[7:46:02] DigitalZonez: but i also consider paladin as one of the more difficult classes to play
[7:46:08] Teagens: I kinda want to play around with everything. But sooooo much time commitment for them all x_x
[7:46:39] thevessa: Paladin is literally the easiest
[7:47:06] Teagens: After playing my Druid in SoM I kinda want to play my Druid in Retail but Retail Druid is soooooo different from classic druid.
[7:47:16] EggWrath: anyone know why my message is being automodded?
[7:47:25] DigitalZonez: but my only belief that paladins are difficult is because there not just damage healer or tank. there always a support class.
[7:47:31] EliBourne: it generates a lot of rage also
[7:47:33] EggWrath: im talking about a buff they just added to prot warriors
[7:47:36] Galdrena: i don't see anything @EggWrath
[7:47:42] Teagens: WHat

[7:55:38] OrdrakTV: gg
[7:55:54] EggWrath: I just said the word in like 10 streams to test, all allowed. Might be a word that has that word inside it thats filtered, not word itself
[7:55:54] Treesy__: He probably telling his mom that swifty is in his team
[7:56:07] DigitalZonez: wait arcane mage pvp?
[7:56:10] DigitalZonez: is that viable?
[7:56:24] Tobbehhh: new wow just destroys the eyes

[7:59:25] EggWrath: im sure there are good reasons for the words to be automodded, cant have the mods doing everything. but i think demoralizing sh- might be an accidental filter
