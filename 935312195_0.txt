[2:25:27] Sollice: Sonic Peach Rings I think is everyones favorite
[2:25:46] griffdog125: towel at the poker table. orders a gfuel. hits a royal flush
[2:25:51] Absynne: Sweet thanks for the suggestions. Ill have to give them all a try. Sonic Peach Rings will be the first lol
[2:25:55] 91Niki: Peach Rings is legit! The Resident Evil Nemesis tea is aright. I am still to try the wumpa fruit tho
[2:26:10] Sollice: Wumpa fruit is the one I am thinking of
[2:26:16] Sollice: That one was pretty good
[2:26:19] Fatpally: o/ chat
[2:26:36] chrslp: Are there any Guava flavored ones?
[2:26:45] KnsWoW: I went with peachrings and fazeberry.. legit af
[2:26:49] micha3lsc0tt: rainbow sherbet is my fav
[2:27:00] micha3lsc0tt: and peach rings and fazeberry next
[2:27:07] Sollice: I am going to get some of the Scorpid Sting when it comes in cans
[2:27:27] Absynne: Is there a huge taste difference between canned and the powder other than maybe the powder taste towards the bottom of the shaker
[2:27:31] iamWaritself: snow cone is a pretty good one too =)
[2:27:51] Carrion_03: Bought my restock of gfuel on Friday. Missed this competition. But picked up some peach rings and sour blue chug rug.
[2:27:58] Sollice: Well can is pre mixed so like you said its probably distributed better
[2:28:04] griffdog125: lol edit your self into the sonic movie stealing his peace rings
[2:28:22] sickboyz: ya
[2:28:26] SonofHorus82: I was thinking about putting ice in my shaker this morning. Would that water it down to much?
[2:28:27] khronicz: Take a bite and end it
[2:28:29] Gruffian: Pretty sure
[2:29:09] Sollice: Katie got on me the other day for double dipping the salsa...I told her she had worse things in her mouth then my double dipped chip. She didn't say much after that
[2:29:29] Broomba: @towelliee -- any classic druid leveling today or this evening?
[2:29:31] Absynne: @SonofHorus82 I always use ice and its never watered down. I just use about 15ish oz instead of 16 to compensate the ice being melted once I shake it
[2:29:31] AbsolutPstachio: What WA does he use for hit BM?
[2:29:40] Sollice: Luth

[2:30:30] Sollice: She gets weird about that stuff. She doesnt drink like the last 1/4th of cans or bottles because she says its backwash. HER OWN BACKWASH
[2:30:49] SonofHorus82: @KnownAsBigT I have one of the big shakers so I normally go up to 25oz. If it doesnt really water it down then I could probably drop to 23oz to compensate.
[2:30:52] 91Niki: @Sollice I never understood that logic LUL
[2:31:04] jboy_tk: Ah this tune is so nostalgic to me
[2:31:14] Sollice: @Towelliee You will have to read up on my earlier comment
[2:32:11] Absynne: @SonofHorus82 Do you still use only 1 scoop with the 25oz or do you use 1 1/2 scoops?

[2:33:01] RodneyIsPro: LUL
[2:33:28] Absynne: @SonofHorus82 Either way yeah it would probably be best to drop it 1.5-2 oz to prevent is from getting watered down
[2:33:43] SonofHorus82: @KnownAsBigT I usually use around a scoop and a quarter. I dont like it to strong though. Might bump that to a scoop and a half to compensate for the extra water in the ice.
[2:33:51] RodneyIsPro: i drink water :)
[2:34:05] chillfasa266: what plates is Toweliee using, anyone know?
[2:34:13] micha3lsc0tt: chat do you think next week we get new patch?
[2:34:15] Mr_Pennywise_: towHAMUP towHAMUP
[2:34:37] Absynne: @SonofHorus82 Probably either way will have the same outcome
[2:35:08] luckfore: yea next week 9.0.4
[2:35:11] luckfore: 9.0.5
[2:35:42] SonofHorus82: @KnownAsBigT perhaps I'll give it a shot tomorrow morning, provided I remember at 0700.

[4:07:22] BullDevil: I'm ready for prideful to be over tbh, its a cool concept with the buff but having people aggro random shit outside of your route just fucks you. Tanks shouldn't be required to be master of mathematics
[4:07:25] Sollice: Priest could be NL or Venthyr
[4:07:43] Sollice: You dont do Kyrian for Havoc
[4:07:50] Sollice: Venthyr/Night Fae
[4:07:55] TheUnknowing: Yeah, too bad I have no reason even with the buff to swap from Kyrian as vengeance @Sollice lol
[4:08:13] Artivicii: BIG BEARVOKE towPog
[4:08:16] DeanoTV: im kyrian on my havoc, venthyr ability is boring af imo
[4:08:17] Sollice: Divine Toll too good
[4:08:28] Sollice: Sinful brand is VERY boring i agree
[4:08:31] DeanoTV: and kyrian bis for veng too
[4:08:42] Sollice: Yea for Veng for sure
[4:09:07] BullDevil: Sinful brand is boring, but i also feel like the 30% haste debuff is overlooked. That shit works on bosses
[4:09:12] Sollice: Sinful Brand is the type of ability that someone made in literally 5 minutes
[4:09:13] TheUnknowing: Elyssian Decree just too good towCry
[4:09:27] jaysteea: Is being nf gonna help me get the higher keys on Havoc?

[5:23:42] Kael88: He goes from young man to old man
[5:23:43] Crunker01: @Towelliee yeah medivh ages him

[6:47:53] Cezzan: id like to see dual spec even though its not really a tbc thing
[6:48:02] Broomba: you never know, you never never know

[6:49:00] SilkeySmooth: @TheUnknowing by bad thc
[6:49:06] Drogdorf: would love dual spec as priest
[6:49:10] Wulfgrym: yep
[6:49:23] SilkeySmooth: it would help kill all the paladin boosting that will be going on
[6:49:25] CritcobainTV: tokens would give me a safe way to buy gold KEKW
[6:49:41] themaras7: BOOST SM now?
[6:49:50] Bieflapjes: How would they handel teh question and starting area's when you can get a blood elf or dreanai early?? Also professions you could get in their starting area right away

[6:50:03] wildwingflashblade: yeah classic was always meh for me... TBC is where the magic was for me
[6:50:08] SutureTV: its so hard to find a group for that stuff cause everyone just buys boosts :(

[6:51:29] Muaytitus: SM is amazing
[6:51:36] SilkeySmooth: tokens or buy wow gold for boosting id rahter by tokens
[6:51:44] TheGaoSora: I can only assume their value would be era fitting
[6:51:57] shimwood: Wailing Caverns for me
[6:52:00] matteus7s: Literally a few GMs to ban bots would fix or atleast reduce bots
[6:52:02] Joryckfree: SFK is top
[6:52:04] junkrat_sky: SM = TABARD FARMING
[6:52:06] Clay2K_: WC for me too
[6:52:11] robertd727: I mean even getting ashbringer is such a RP moment
[6:52:15] chrslp: I just got key last night FeelsGoodMan
[6:52:26] Muaytitus: it was one of the few dung's you farmed as low lvl because the gear was so good
[6:52:36] themaras7: BOTS inside dungeons now
[6:52:46] Affiiance: Botters are always working on finding a way around while Blizz is searching to stop the old ways
[6:52:47] TheGaoSora: another ez lazy fix: ban MB
[6:53:06] Wulfgrym: well the put the screws to multiboxers, i hope they fix the botting problem
[6:53:08] dwolters_the_zombieman: people who dont want tokens are people who want to bot and try to ruin it for others lol
[6:53:13] chrslp: There was a guy botting in Thousand Needles the past few days and hes been stuck and just going back and forth between 2 rocks
[6:53:13] Broomba: @TheOmniSora MB is not botting
[6:53:16] themaras7: RFD
[6:53:20] chrslp: Reported 3 times
[6:53:22] chrslp: Nothing done
[6:53:28] Bieflapjes: they should ban them but not their subscription :p

[6:53:34] Moobot: towGreen Shadowlands Limited Edition TOWELLIEE covenant shirts AND Towelliee hats are LIVE! check them out HERE! | Dbh.la/towelliee towBlue
[6:53:39] TheGaoSora: @Broomba didn't say it is, but it will make bot detection easier
[6:54:02] Broomba: i think blizzard knows who or what a bot is and what or who is MB
[6:54:04] TheGaoSora: also make a healthier market
[6:54:11] roflpotamus: How full is the guild? @Towelliee
[6:54:13] chrslp: Also the issue with bots is they use a lot of the same functions your special mouse and keyboard buttons use
[6:54:20] themaras7: graveyard quest
[6:54:34] SutureTV: theres a lib quest in TB, the GY quest is inside the GY
[6:54:36] chrslp: If you did blanket bans, youd prolly catch a lot of people with macros on their mouse
[6:54:47] chrslp: Not in-game macros. Like the logitech macros
[6:54:52] Broomba: @chrslp true, bots only do certain functions and act and behave certain ways, MB does not since a person actually controls the toon
[6:55:09] roflpotamus: Cool, Im lvling on ally for my rogue main for TBC but want a horde pally alt- hoping to join when they come out
[6:55:25] TheGaoSora: They don't, they only keep MB around for some reason... they don't even pay sub money
[6:55:47] Exxcar: MB pay subs? lol?
[6:55:59] Exxcar: Even if its through token, someone still had to pay for that
[6:56:02] Wulfgrym: those people who complain about farming should be banned so they can go re-configure their lives
[6:56:03] Xoyzor: welp.. that's just no time efficient gold making
[6:56:07] Darkasi_: The return of the Shadowmoon valley chinese gold farmers.....they were prepared
[6:56:07] themaras7: its inside graveyard
[6:56:14] Broomba: i legit MB for leveling, gear and fun not for botting or ruining the game
[6:56:14] pattar101: are old raids good for gold?
[6:56:23] roeddogg: spacex!!! go SN10!!!
[6:56:26] TheGaoSora: it's an irony that token buyers actually pay for their sub lol
[6:56:37] TheGaoSora: *the MB subs
[6:56:48] chrslp: LUL
[6:56:49] Wulfgrym: cheers to anyone who wants to farm
[6:56:55] chrslp: I have 30g
[6:57:03] PawgersHC: Are druids meta tanks in TBC?
[6:57:08] stallowned: much easier to make gold in BC anyways imo
[6:57:12] TheGaoSora: sure, just farm legit, and not with 5 chars
[6:57:17] themaras7: u have to find a party first right
[6:57:18] shimwood: I actually play WoW more with a job than I did when I was in college LuL
[6:57:21] Alepouditsa: it will have bean beter to restart realy
[6:57:22] GodKingMuninn: If you're the person putting oneof each ietem up for 711 gold though, get fukt
[6:57:27] chrslp: Under that thinking, shouldnt gold selling and buying be OK too?
[6:57:28] CrucifyMTG: i just bought 5k gold fuck farming
[6:57:33] chrslp: Its my money
[6:57:35] chrslp: LUL
[6:57:35] Austei: farm elementals
[6:57:41] metavahn: because good matters in classic
[6:57:42] Redbearded16: @shimwood same my dude lol
[6:57:44] Wulfgrym: getting too goddam old to worry about stupid stuff like that, they are having fun, not harming anything, good for them
[6:57:48] xxxpleblordxxx: elon musk rocket going up soon
[6:57:57] metavahn: gold*

[6:58:56] SlapaH03: in SL they still wear the green boost trinket LUL
[6:58:56] Wulfgrym: they keyboard turn and their movements look artificial
[6:58:59] themaras7: wrong way
[6:59:01] Clay2K_: far right, you're going wrong way
[6:59:09] Swar_lee: wrong road
[6:59:13] drskull452: your goin to the north beach
[6:59:14] The_Boctor: @Towelliee you need to head across the lake the road is way to the east
