[0:04:34] phailix: maybe they are adding the supply rewards?
[0:04:50] phailix: they said it was bugged on Tuesday
[0:05:57] phailix: STV has been fun, ngl. I wasnt sure at first, but it's 1000 times better then ashenvale
[0:06:22] phailix: the lag is kinda weird at times, but beside that, pretty happy with stv
[0:07:28] j1gge: if you dont like the troll boss we dont like the troll boss
[0:07:29] dumpringz: so laggy on na

[0:10:36] jazni_23: dispersion feels a bit OP, feels like you gotta kill a priest twice
[0:10:48] wildxsnorlax: how are mages?
[0:10:58] watchmeaim: warrior s+?
[0:10:59] MrPoulpp: Hey all !
[0:11:10] phailix: they have to buff hard casts, not dots
[0:11:16] beatdown91: is melee hunter still that good even after the little nerf at raptor strike?
[0:11:17] phailix: if they want to balance pve/pvp
[0:11:55] phailix: but that's caster life, if you let em cast, you die
[0:12:23] dankks31: what new tier list for pvp
[0:12:26] epicowo: !talents
[0:12:26] Nightbot: Shadow Talents: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-XptVsA3A0 /// Disc Talents: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmAxwZ8lzYs
[0:12:49] wildxsnorlax: how do you think mages will do on the new list?
[0:12:49] phailix: You think having a separate balance for pvp/pve like in retail is bad or good?
[0:13:10] Skilten: @beatdown91 doesnt look like that did much to their damage, they're still #1 on WCL
[0:13:22] MrPoulpp: servers up
[0:13:55] j1mb00lman: how often are you mana burning in 1v1s?
[0:14:31] DaWutz: how is the questlog addon called hydra?
[0:14:35] WheelieWheelz: servers up
[0:14:47] beatdown91: @skilten i saw like 25% decrease of my raptor strike damage maybe a bit more
[0:14:55] DaWutz: aletrix plus?
[0:15:45] Dukich: how are mages in pvp?
[0:16:03] dankks31: yo what new pvp gear?
[0:16:38] phenomzlol: @DaWutz Leatrix Plus
[0:16:53] Vetto_7: hey, what realm you play?
[0:17:59] druggyss: Warrior is S tier 100% now
[0:18:08] budgetmeroz: budgetmeroz subscribed with Prime. 
[0:18:13] davidlew1s: What about holy pala
[0:18:15] soulyam200: ret paladin S tier?
[0:18:42] thehighqi: worst class right now?
[0:18:58] MrPoulpp: its a nerf if you have slow speed weapon (more than 2.4) if you use fast weapon its a buff ;P
[0:19:08] star_wars_coffee: New list? Nice, perfect timing for me wanting to make an alt to my Rogue.

[0:19:52] marshedpotato: Activision don't like putting people on payroll. they're only interested in investing in solutions that are automated
[0:20:39] mackanftp: Where is list??
[0:21:05] zpeer0216: Already record the pvp tier list video?
[0:21:06] qarij: !bis

[0:21:19] phenomzlol: i think they're talking about just the weapon normalization
[0:21:27] phenomzlol: to raptor strike
[0:21:41] star_wars_coffee: The weapon normalization is hardly a nerf. It'll change what weapons are BiS and Hunter damage will still be top-tier.
[0:21:45] Kaekias: happy weekend hydra and chat
[0:22:02] shaxylul: @star_wars_coffee no fists are still bis
[0:22:13] star_wars_coffee: @shaxylul Just because they're so high damage?
[0:22:14] welouw: !bis
[0:22:14] Waterwalk: 5%
[0:22:14] Nightbot: Disco: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=es4BU1N8Swc Shadow: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jG_86N-QtnU
[0:22:17] shaxylul: It's 5% only
[0:22:18] jorreboi: Not much, its a 5% dmg nerf
[0:22:24] ariacy: I think it is around 80 less damage
[0:22:24] jorreboi: with slow weapons
[0:22:28] budgetmeroz: <3
[0:22:28] MrPoulpp: If you use weapon slower than 2.4 its a nerf but if the weapon is faster its a small buff
[0:22:36] KALOVAYA_MACCA_CTACA: @Hydramist next patch Starfire has 2 more ranks, it will hit double damage. Do you think they will even notice that?
[0:22:42] mackanftp: List?
[0:22:42] druggyss: its shiet tier
[0:22:44] druggyss: :D warr
[0:22:45] shaxylul: @star_wars_coffee yea ofc
[0:22:52] soulyam200: what we have on S tier?
[0:24:06] Kingtuck19: !tier
[0:24:18] beatdown91: currently i'm using Protector sword as main hand from wsg rep. i used to crit like 700-850 and now i do on same target like 500 raptor strike
[0:24:22] encrypteddeath: I don't think they should of nerf'd shadow word death
[0:24:25] encrypteddeath: whats your opinion?
[0:24:40] EomerLemos: But then we would be out of this to complain about!
[0:24:45] shaxylul: agreed
[0:24:54] g0dzilla: 1shot shit is bad for the game
[0:25:09] g0dzilla: same like arcane surge
[0:25:23] g0dzilla: or boomie
[0:25:34] raags_: then remove stuns
[0:25:38] KALOVAYA_MACCA_CTACA: it's right now with every caster, living flame does 6k damage over 30s. It's not stoppable
[0:25:51] KALOVAYA_MACCA_CTACA: living flame + living bomb = 10k damage
[0:25:54] ThePandaway: @g0dzilla arcane surge has a 2min cd shadow word death doesnt
[0:26:01] raags_: you take damage from SWD.
[0:26:08] raags_: sW D is fine
[0:26:11] star_wars_coffee: @raags_ Only if the player doesn't die from the attack.
[0:26:16] fiskensfriend: @KALOVAYA_MACCA_CTACA Pure propaganda
[0:26:21] raags_: ya that
[0:26:21] QBall162: You mean like Rogues? I'll be 100-0'd while stunned from Rogues lol.
[0:26:22] deerobx: Hello folks
[0:26:33] raags_: damage ahould be breaking stuns
[0:27:02] encrypteddeath: I feel like undead rogue hard counters shadow priest.
[0:27:25] JavaSkrpt: JavaSkrpt watched 5 consecutive streams this month and sparked a watch streak! What is this game
[0:27:27] raags_: Im not saying g remove stuns
[0:27:35] star_wars_coffee: Rogues can kill one player in a stun lock and they still can't do it instantly.
[0:27:43] raags_: but ppl crying about priest. gimme a break
[0:27:52] KALOVAYA_MACCA_CTACA: @encrypteddeath rogue counter everything, blind sap + double vanish
[0:27:56] raags_: the spell damages the caster as well.
[0:28:02] encrypteddeath: Agreed.
[0:28:09] Duncan_94: does frost mage beat Spri 100% of the time when they have block?
[0:28:35] raags_: priest or healer are number 1 target in all pvp
[0:28:42] raags_: always
[0:28:57] Vazcoll: Vazcoll subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 8 months! hydraPog hydraPog hydraPog hydraPog hydraPog
[0:29:08] QBall162: I'm very happy with Elemental. I feel it's balanced. Lava burst can hit pretty hard, but it feels gross when you get that 5% power surge proc.
[0:29:09] j_dillinger777: why u thjink rog is rso good? he's quite easy to outplay imo
[0:29:14] Kaekias: hydraSub hydraSub hydraSub hydraSub hydraSub
[0:29:17] raags_: if anything priests need to carry a shield lol
[0:29:32] QBall162: Balanced in comparison against other casters I mean.
[0:30:09] rosbaek: What is your opinion of warlock in pvp ?
[0:30:29] Degradingaf: Enh with the buff is feeling alot better. Still run into the problem of diving as a melee toon but if I get to people 9/10 times they will blow up
[0:30:32] QBall162: Yeah, agreed. High risk, high reward.
[0:30:42] g0dzilla: do you think its possible to balance classes?
[0:30:47] g0dzilla: curious
[0:30:48] star_wars_coffee: I'm considering rolling Horde to play Shaman because they seem strong but super balanced, really high skill ceiling too
[0:30:51] Dukich: Pshero cannot kill demo warlock heh
[0:30:53] tdbeach1985: I just tuned in what classes do you have at s tier currently?
[0:31:07] rosbaek: its so boring not being able to cast in pvp as a warlock xD
[0:31:09] rosbaek: i just instadie
[0:32:02] rxflxct_: without coil and shadowfury, warlock is never able to cast LUL
[0:32:04] Kaekias: dmg against mechanical
[0:32:12] QBall162: If they can tune down mutilate and raptor strike, I'll be happy with overall balance state (obviously it's not perfect).
[0:32:42] MrPoulpp: dismantle is an enchant to do extra dmg to mechanicals.
[0:32:48] Kaekias: that more looks like an enhance fix, rather tahn a buff
[0:32:50] star_wars_coffee: @QBall162 They can't tune down Mutilate without buffing other things for Rogues. It's the only spec and damaging ability we have right now that's viable.
[0:32:51] Nightbot: Secure your privacy with Surfshark! Enter coupon code hydra for an extra 3 months free at https://surfshark.deals/hydra
[0:33:20] QBall162: @star_wars_coffee That's fine by me. It's the lack of counterplay of being stunned my entire life bar that doesn't make sense.
[0:33:51] Kaekias: are you running 2x windfury weapon as enhance? i cannot imagine
[0:34:05] star_wars_coffee: @QBall162 Rogues have been able to stun lock single targets since the dawn of WoW. That's never going to change.
[0:34:08] Degradingaf: wf/rb is still what most roll
[0:34:09] StreamElements: Excited to be partnering with HelloFresh! Use my code POGUKFRESH3312 and get 60% off your 1st box + 20% off the next 2 months + free gifts! https://strms.net/hellofresh_hydramist #ad
[0:34:10] Da_Funkz: every rune needs a nerf imo
[0:34:11] Cahirs: Which healer is best mana wise atm?
[0:34:37] fiskensfriend: if mut had the same positional req as backstab it would be fine. Or atleast keep the dmg as is the same when dealt from behind but nerf frontal dmg
[0:34:52] Kaekias: sure, flurry is good. but in pvp especially frost brand seems good to me on offhand (without having looked at the spec)
[0:34:57] QBall162: @star_wars_coffee The stuns aren't the issue, the point I'm trying to make is that you get 100'd while chain stun. The stun isn't the problem, it's the damage that is.
[0:35:36] tdbeach1985: @Hydramist I just tuned in what classes did you have at S tier now in the updated tier list?
[0:35:37] star_wars_coffee: @QBall162 You can get 100% even if they lower damage. Between CS, KS, Blind, restealth, sap, etc. You can lower Rogue damage and a competent Rogue can still keep you stunlocked for minutes if needed as long as the Rogue has enough time to do it.
[0:35:40] myop: !runes
[0:35:40] Nightbot: Shadow Runes: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-XptVsA3A0 /// Disc Runes: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmAxwZ8lzYs
[0:36:18] argybis: yo @Hydramist  i just dinged 40 on my first char!
[0:36:19] star_wars_coffee: If they do 50 energy Mutilate the entire Rogue rotation will break lol
[0:36:22] j_dillinger777: at 50 rog's would ber even more shit, they lack energy regeneration rn
[0:36:40] MooseTorpedoMan: mut nerf would ruin them in pve theyre already dropping in raid dps and haev no utility
[0:36:52] star_wars_coffee: Exactly
[0:36:57] j_dillinger777: you could in a 1v1.
[0:37:21] QBall162: @star_wars_coffee The last sentence is how it should be. A COMPETENT rogue should pop off.
[0:37:40] watchmeaim: what do you think about warriors what runes need to be added to be cool in pvp?
[0:37:47] Nightbot: Follow Hydra's twitter! https://twitter.com/hydramist
[0:37:47] star_wars_coffee: Yep
[0:37:48] argybis: hydraTilt hydraTilt hydraTilt
[0:37:53] DuduIsFTeam: what if he's undead lmao
[0:37:57] star_wars_coffee: If our fear break trink is on CD then we're dead instantly
[0:38:01] Kaekias: hydraMindgoose
[0:38:18] DuduIsFTeam: pvp feels really bad atm, idk
[0:38:37] DuduIsFTeam: burst meta sucks
[0:38:59] Greghar1: With current damage levels we would need double health to make it playable
[0:39:15] QBall162: @kaekias Going back to WF, I think they're pushing for WF on main, FT on secondary because it getting buffed AGAIN a week or 2 ago.
[0:39:20] fiskensfriend: @Greghar1 why is it not playable now?
[0:39:52] QBall162: *lava got buffed a week or 2.
[0:39:53] Greghar1: every other class has a 1 shot
[0:40:07] fiskensfriend: @Greghar1 so the problem is instant dmg that hydra is talking about
[0:40:16] klaber0k: @Hydramist Yo mate, how are you ?  Have a nice stream
[0:40:33] Kaekias: @QBall162 for PvE for sure. but PvP has always been weird ^^
[0:40:34] DuduIsFTeam: @fiskensfriend Shamans are doing some insane dmg
[0:40:46] prodigy_wow: Lmao
[0:40:48] marre_88: haha for real
[0:40:52] star_wars_coffee: Burst meta > damage sponges
[0:40:55] budgetmeroz: hahahaha
[0:40:59] fiskensfriend: ppl are coping saying that "burst meta is bad" as if they would magically win if ppl had more hp
[0:41:02] Zelimeth: get gud
[0:41:02] budgetmeroz: +1
[0:41:05] Kaekias: but i should be able to tank 5 ppl, hurr durr 3head
[0:41:09] marre_88: 100% true
[0:41:11] lerler: bruh what are you doing for gold? im so broke
[0:41:12] testestkappa: what do you think of introducing resilience
[0:41:17] Zelimeth: ok hydra i'll get better :(
[0:41:18] star_wars_coffee: It's more fun overall to kill and be killed quickly than long drawn out spongey fights
[0:41:33] budgetmeroz: what general spec are you running for pvp
[0:41:41] Kaacia: What do you mean I can't charge into a 5 man premade as a warrior and bladestorm like Klinda? hydraF
[0:41:48] ironpallyone: I am 100% that guy on postion
[0:41:56] ThePandaway: What is the addon that shows the mana cost of spells?
[0:42:03] QBall162: I switched to Eng 2H...I just let myself become a peel because if I go in I'll be struggling due to mobility issues. 😂
[0:42:17] wutfacesz: when did the dampen meta start, after cata or during
[0:42:28] bloodandbone: its not only the bgs hydra its evan in stv evan if that might be much more to think of
[0:42:30] lerler: hydra btw, sims for priest came out, TF is better by about 50dps
[0:42:32] DuduIsFTeam: @star_wars_coffee Bro, 1v1's are lasting 10/15 secs
[0:42:36] Greghar1: Im liking hunter gameplay running ranged with entrapment so far
[0:42:37] DuduIsFTeam: that's insane
[0:42:58] linkens_here: 40yd instant nukes the sod experience
[0:43:00] QBall162: Yeah, enhanced 2H. Just spending my BGs peeling for my backline.
[0:43:02] Kaekias: 2h17m34s
[0:43:17] KALOVAYA_MACCA_CTACA: until somebody's gear breaks
[0:43:25] Kaekias: oof
[0:43:25] Zelimeth: in a tourny setting, long.. .in wpvp a fast 1v1 ideal
[0:43:33] ThePandaway: @Hydramist What is the addon for mana cost on your action bar?
[0:43:33] DuduIsFTeam: i got ur point
[0:43:36] DuduIsFTeam: but
[0:44:16] DuduIsFTeam: feels like just whoever throw their shit first wins
[0:44:34] lamerengademaduixa: and unwinneable if the rogue has prep
[0:44:39] phenomzlol: @ThePandaway that would be Stat Weights Classic
[0:44:42] fakemejo: wtf u got gold
[0:44:51] linkens_here: i hate the previous tourneys that were just oom'ing mana users meta
[0:45:02] ThePandaway: @phenomzlol thanks

[3:19:57] Mystiggo: no blackout, no 15% dmg reduction
[3:20:03] Landon_MDL: barrier you get it at redridge

[7:57:26] QBall162: I'm curious how 5% stacks vs attack power. I get 139mp1 without shouts/strength totem.
[7:57:26] maniekloll: earth shield was useless before
[7:57:39] FIREMAGZZ: i want them to get SPIRIT LINK TOTEM
[7:57:42] notgarru: give them mop healing stream totem as well
[7:57:59] Devii7: where is our pushbakc protection????
[7:58:02] bisonkron: @QBall162 it will be 75% of your mana pool, w/e that is
[7:58:12] 0wn3r4ever2: can u link it?
[7:58:22] snayrofficial: blizzard hates frost mage
[7:59:08] HeyImArty: Rdruid changes are nice, actual preessable abilities now
[8:00:04] Devii7: how do we geht pushback protection next phase?
[8:00:30] hughjasses: pretty exciting patch notes though
[8:00:46] Devii7: ok but thats only on crits, boomie got 70%...
[8:00:52] ZeekoGG: warrior prob gonna go upp with the armor nerf
[8:01:00] hughjasses: we talking pvp zeeko
[8:01:16] ZeekoGG: ah mb
[8:01:18] hughjasses: small gnomer armor nerf
[8:01:41] Mankz: U think survival hunter is over BM in pvp?
[8:01:50] Mankz: specifically stv event
[8:02:06] Wolf_Monster: why do you think ele is good? its so hard to cast and flame shock is only 20 yrs

[8:02:19] bahamastbc: Even if Rsham gets a better ES, they are still trash ngl. But its a step in the right way
[8:02:21] almostgoodtft: depends on how they scale the 20% ap from alpha. If it scales with double rockbiter it will just be silly.
[8:02:29] berni2031: grats on the bracers! what a grind huh
[8:02:35] t1shy: anyone link the notes?
[8:02:57] BRabbityooo: I dont understand how holy paladin is not touched, it is so bad too
[8:02:57] fakemejo: i mean right now he is ranking em in general not in only stv event, have that in mind =D
[8:03:04] peeweeherman69: 10 recovering alcoholics leave stream everytime u mention a beer LUL
[8:03:05] maniekloll: also pushback kinda gimps them

[8:03:32] Mystiggo: redirect change kinda big for rogues no? cooldown from 1 min to 10 seconds and completely removed off gcd
[8:03:35] Wolf_Monster: so ele is good in stv?

[8:05:26] Distorpia: did i miss the entire tierlist breakdown ?! :/
[8:05:27] Mystiggo: ohh you're right
[8:05:33] Mystiggo: who cares then
[8:08:03] QBall162: Honestly, I prefer earthen in PvP as Ele. In BM I usually die before I go OOM (power surge as well gives mana). The pushback really helps against 3rd parties or people pushing me.
[8:08:14] Distorpia: these rdruid changes are bonkers

[8:12:22] Toxiferous: potion
[8:12:37] Toxiferous: you sure you've played this game for 20 years? KEKL
[8:14:04] Toxiferous: 1g25 is a steal
[8:14:16] 23rhz: uuuh boomy buffs? urgh
[8:14:45] 23rhz: druid resto s tier aswell now? looks good on paper
[8:15:31] 23rhz: they wanna move boomy away from wild growth in pvp i guess
[8:15:38] 23rhz: seems like alot of dmg though
[8:15:47] barlos124: Think u need more priests in ur bg
[8:15:54] ZeusFromHeaven: we need a little bit of warrior buffs (armor pen related)
[8:16:15] ZeusFromHeaven: every class in the game has increased armor PvP
[8:16:20] ZeusFromHeaven: compared to what they had on classic
[8:16:21] 23rhz: warriors will be crazy, as they scale and now got mobility
[8:16:29] 23rhz: they will be fuckin insane again, sadge
[8:16:34] F3scorn: How do I share a weakaura without the wall of text outside of the game?
[8:16:36] ZeusFromHeaven: wet noodle yea
[8:16:39] ZeusFromHeaven: feels akward
[8:16:40] ZeusFromHeaven: to play
[8:16:42] ZeusFromHeaven: no rage no dmg
[8:16:57] mithrandoig: the damage will come at 60 for warriors
[8:17:01] mithrandoig: imo
[8:17:01] KussTV: sorry to bail, had to raid gnomer
[8:17:27] barlos124: The heal is weird in pvp.  It's a decent amount of health back but it is easily dpsed through
[8:17:53] leekshape: i play warrior, i deal dmg, take flag, dont take warbringer its a bait and endless rage ofc
[8:18:23] Selecktt: Tbh, STRONGLY disagree. Our damage is fine. No need for damage buffs. But our utility is peepeepoopoo. Our only sustain is a 30% heal over 10s on a 3m cd. And its mutually exclusive with intervene. We have a 5m fear. And thats it for our utility. And we're not tanky enough to survive a mutilate burst. We need something other than damage.
[8:18:27] ouudelali: @hydramist will you push rank 14 is there is any level 60 ?

[8:19:51] prodigy_wow: @ouudelali Everyone and their mom will be rank 14 since they changed the way the system works
[8:19:53] alexbilbaoo: Yo! PvP TIERLIST coming to yt?
[8:20:12] ZeusFromHeaven: yeah
[8:20:31] F3scorn: @Hydramist I want to share a cool PW:S health Weakaura with you but I don't know how. It creates a HP bar gauge to the right of your character model
[8:20:32] ZeusFromHeaven: im not saying warr is bad, just feels bad to play warr with everyone has increased armor
[8:20:33] Eilert1994: you seen the class changes for the 27.th?

[8:24:04] videogamewatcher123: my biggest worry with sod is they would afk on balancing, but it hasnt been the worst
[8:24:26] QBall162: I absolutely am excited about the 2H buff. I know it's not optimal, but when I'm bored of Ele I love to bonk people with war totem.
[8:24:54] Mystiggo: the stv shaman totem is actually so cool
[8:25:02] Mystiggo: hope they do more fun stuff like that for other classes in future phases
[8:25:12] Plaguethong: !server
[8:25:13] Nightbot: Living Flame Horde EU / Crusader Strike Horde US
[8:25:33] Selecktt: The biggest gripe I have rn is that warriors runes are all boring. We got nothing new. Everything is a % modifier. 10% more damage. 10% move speed. 25% damage. Most interesting thing we got is slam is instant. Otherwise the playstyle is exactly the same. Nothing new here.
[8:25:39] NeVolent: u play with no void plague? u crazzyyyyyy? WutFace WutFace WutFace
[8:25:39] h3zky: were you using a weakaura on nameplates to show when something's in death range?

[8:50:53] maniekloll: for me it has to be shaman tank rune
[8:51:11] maniekloll: really great to have them have that new role
[8:51:23] edvh: I'm sure you've answered this before, but why Twisted faith?
[8:51:29] JayyySix: tierlist done yet?
[8:51:39] edvh: fair
[8:51:39] vrsswow: can u imagine rune of vampiric touch
[8:51:39] lynchmvp: they could even add new classes to 60 and it would be sick
[8:51:42] Selecktt: Springboard from SoD into Classic+. I really feel like they're using sod to dip their toes into the "complete classic revamp" pool

[8:52:35] flayqtt: in game ofc
[8:52:37] Mystiggo: the 30 second saps and polies and whatnot
[8:52:44] maniekloll: as for mage healer - that's a bit of a problem of wow not going outside of a triangle damage - tank - healer. If they could be a support role that would awesome
[8:52:59] maniekloll: something that for example tanks were in wotlk arena
[8:53:04] hisaki44: whats the range on void spike
[8:53:08] flayqtt: dk launch ololol

[8:54:35] da_pingping: i missed tierlist ?
[8:54:38] Kaekias: at least they are not giving up instantly
[8:54:40] Selecktt: I think for the p3 event they're going to borrow from diablo 4 fields of hatred. Solo event. Collect currency from spawned containers and mobs. Gain stats the more currency you have. Become a raid boss. Player with the most is marked on the map. Extract with it to collect it.
[8:54:42] maniekloll: @Hydramist what do you think about statment "true balance kills classes"?
[8:55:05] usualtwitcher: @Hydramist u just swiching void plague for fun ?

[9:42:46] chard_GG: think sp should get similiar buff like what moonkins are getting? heal etc without dropping form
[9:42:47] drconvicto: came back to hearing the nerfs, they are finally done nerfing hunters into complete unfunctionality

[9:44:23] NeVolent: @drconvicto why? for raptor strike?
[9:44:39] GrenadeHPC: abolish and fear ward in shadow would be nice
[9:44:51] kayuss: !build
[9:45:02] Selecktt: heals in shadowform would be neat if they were reclassed as shadow school. can then be locked out of both healing and damage.
[9:45:05] pw_scyld: insta healing touch in boomkin form is kinda situational tho
[9:45:21] jorreboi: little insta greater heal proc from mind blast ofc is needed
[9:45:30] ndras: maybe give them abo and fear ward in shadow but with 50% mana cost increase
[9:45:45] NeVolent: boomkins back to op now xD
[9:45:49] jorreboi: jkjk, shadow doesnt need a single buff
[9:46:08] drconvicto: @NeVolent so they had one ability that carried them to be a contender in dps and it was raptor strike, now nerfed 30% it will make hunters complete dogshit in every meganerfed spec
[9:46:34] NeVolent: well when an ability can 2-3 shot u yes needs a nerf
[9:46:46] NeVolent: they prolly buff hunters somehow like they are doing to moonkins now
[9:46:55] NeVolent: for pvp are kinda busted
[9:46:57] drconvicto: @NeVolent OH LIKE SHADOW WORD DEATH?
[9:47:09] NeVolent: what about it?
[9:47:09] drconvicto: oh like mages main ability?
[9:47:16] drconvicto: oh like chaos bolt?
[9:47:27] drconvicto: and they are ONE shotting not 4 shotting
[9:47:34] NeVolent: lol
[9:47:35] drconvicto: and if u so bad that u let a hunter do 4 globals on you
[9:47:37] drconvicto: you are fkn bad
[9:47:40] NeVolent: chaos bolt 2,5 sec cast :p
[9:47:50] NeVolent: plus u need to cast 2.2 cast incinerate first
[9:47:56] jorreboi: Drconvicto has HAD it with these hunter nerfs!
[9:48:10] NeVolent: while i just press instant ability for 900 dmg crits
[9:48:12] Selecktt: @drconvicto DW Specialization already acts as a 75% damage buff just by virtue of hitting with the offhand. a 30% damage buff on top of that is a total of 127%.
[9:48:18] NeVolent: twice and u kill a person :P come  on man
[9:48:27] Vaegaron_Viseriona: Hydra can u show ur Talents again? 🫢
[9:48:50] drconvicto: yeah blizz approach to hunters is just nerfing it to the ground whenever there is anything remotely op, and any other class that has (priest) they just hand out a 7% nerf

[9:52:35] drconvicto: priests handing out nukes with one hand and 200%hp heals in the other

[9:58:56] Mossing: tribalisem is hell of a thing
[9:59:07] drconvicto: valid point, however scaling down just one class constantly whenever theres anything broken, and never doing anything about any other class
[9:59:09] dreeeamyy: Some people think they deserve to be broken cause their class/spec has been bad before
[9:59:10] jhk97: i think fairness doesnt matter to them, its all about winning easily
[9:59:35] Frig0z: but instant do big dam
[9:59:45] Selecktt: @NeVolent You lot get a head rune that lets all your dots crit (and the 30% crit CD you can snapshot) I'm also 90% sure you can go full destro, conflag and unstable affliction and force the silence by consuming it.
[10:00:17] slarenoff: its his auto attack
