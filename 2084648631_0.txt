[3:10:26] Asaikos: 14 years ago Aware
[3:10:37] fogmod: do you think classic players will like cata?
[3:10:38] ronconi: cata login screen is the absolute best
[3:10:39] mordiell: @rwubs4 im guessing they will add instant lvl 80 at one point
[3:10:42] Curtsy: @rwubs4 cata revamps all the old world lol, thats part of the testing
[3:10:45] J_Rich94: im gonna stick to SoD and Vanilla
[3:10:50] rwubs4: yeah hope so then beta makes more sense
[3:10:52] mordiell: when they are sure leveling works well
[3:10:54] Hylaren: Hmm interesting
[3:10:56] toooth: staff of the forsen
[3:10:59] Amberillion: Hello there! Did you get a special access to Cata-Classic or is it actually out already? :o

[3:11:03] MlLKYBLAST: @mordiell They already added an instant lvl 80 boost
[3:11:05] Laaash: fuck no

[3:11:21] ninespoons: I never played it so I'm keen to try
[3:11:22] Rhudalun: TBC and Wotlk perma servers please :P
[3:11:26] hushbang: Brave prediction LUL
[3:11:28] MlLKYBLAST: Oh, in beta no. Sorry Mordiell
[3:11:28] Shake4L: what a strong take, "some will like it, some wont" KEKW
[3:11:30] TKoNoR: People who like cata should just play retail
[3:11:31] Curtsy: @rwubs4 When it becomes PTR instead of closed beta they will most likely add in premade high levels
[3:11:31] ounager: they need to relaunch tbc
[3:11:31] Rhudalun: for those who doesnt like cata or vanilla
[3:11:32] migbilkers: Classic players wont play and retail players will just stick to retail, cata literally has no point in existing
[3:11:35] sircrumpler: I hate cats for example
[3:11:35] AceOfFlame: I havn't played cata at all but I always feel like people who severely hate Cata are just people who haven't played cata at all and just went on some bandwagon of hate
[3:11:36] specialkidmiles: I'm sarcastic :P
[3:11:38] MeowgicTheCathering: when deathwing broke through to azeroth and caused the cataclysm he also split the playerbase Aware
[3:11:39] Plush7734: I loved cata! Going to have to much fun in it :D
[3:11:39] sircrumpler: I hate cata*

[3:11:58] piperboi: Hottake ppl complaining about greens at lvl 4 is the ppl that sends green/Rares/epics to alts when levelling
[3:11:58] singo00: they only hate it becuse they think it ruined the game when it was the player base dat did
[3:12:00] Khalito94: the remaking of the world is a huge factor
[3:12:00] Curtsy: People who like stuff simply don't talk about it and just play it
[3:12:00] Alexos96: true

[3:13:03] Donzle: make a goblin Madge Madge Madge
[3:13:07] TKoNoR: sod > cata = retail
[3:13:07] Kurama__95: @TKoNoR To me it feels like my grandpa, who sold his car to buy a VW cuz he likes it better
[3:13:08] Yvernaa: People hated the world changing and dragon soul, those are literally the two main reasons quantHmph
[3:13:09] FaeFlowerr: cata is GIGA SoD
[3:13:09] kri_kurilala: HEROIN?

[3:13:52] baraknroll: Cata raiding is A LOT of fun Dragon Soul Raid was really cool, Bastion of Twilight was also great!
[3:13:52] EnigmaticHD: That spell pushback is a joke
[3:13:55] MeowgicTheCathering: worgen starting was one of the first major phasing tech implementations i think back then
[3:13:56] Heazzly: Madge you better not have a good time
[3:13:56] Dogarian: bing bing bong
[3:13:59] CoolTV: was gnome hunter available?
[3:13:59] singo00: its one of if not the best starter zone

[3:14:40] frexzl: People don't like cata just like they gave up on wrath in icc due to the game becoming too hard for the regular casuals who prefered the mc style of loot pinata raids

[3:25:58] HighTerms: world pvp sustained me in vanilla tbh
[3:25:58] sircrumpler: Wpvp was always intended to be able to kill the other factor for resources. Not to hunt people for sport
