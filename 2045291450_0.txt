[0:22:29] eielwind: apparently i only need 10 more dialies for thet 10000 dailies achievement, so thats my new goal
[0:22:35] Ujai321: do you like those WQs better, or the one where you had to walk a line VERY precisely?
[0:23:01] Ryok: yesterday i went to a 2nd hand store and managed to grab 4 original english versions of harry potter for 2€ each... problem is it's books 4, 5, 6 and 7 xD so i somehow have to acquire books 1-3 and 8 in english so i can actually read them in order, because no way i'm starting with 4 D:
[0:23:02] Ujai321: CHEATING!? i am shocked
[0:23:07] MeowDorei: wai are you in highmeowtain?
[0:23:15] jgbrit: Those were DISGUSTING
[0:23:15] dergNwolf: calligraphy was BASED
[0:23:25] dergNwolf: used to roll over those, it was fun
[0:23:30] dergNwolf: like, literally. WW Monk main
[0:23:32] dergNwolf: tippiTap
[0:23:36] witchhobbit: LUL
[0:23:37] Ujai321: based is good
[0:23:38] Marovia: based =  legit
[0:23:41] OlsargeTV: LUL
[0:23:48] zannuss: Dont worry, I dont know either
[0:23:49] Ujai321: it just is
[0:23:52] komolana: based (in good and solid fact)
[0:23:53] witchhobbit: same lol
[0:23:55] jkuhl58: I prefer the alkaline meaning
[0:23:58] daws001: ventafNoted
[0:23:59] Marovia: because of the rizz
[0:24:00] dergNwolf: I don't know why either
[0:24:06] Daemavand: Im glad you asked because I had no idea wtf it meant either lol
[0:24:11] cashthb: I already explaind it!
[0:24:21] zannuss: I'm about to be 41, I dont know what any of these slang words are
[0:24:26] Ryok: i'm getting too old i hate all these new terms kids come up with D:
[0:24:28] Daemavand: lol
[0:24:31] heldtheline: I only found out what rizz was the other day; I'm officially old.
[0:24:41] Marovia: raddical!
[0:24:41] TheBenXO: based fr no cap
[0:24:42] Daemavand: Dang whippersnappers
[0:24:42] eielwind: yeah i barely know what rizz is
[0:24:45] Daemavand: saying new things
[0:24:45] russtrotter: yeah i'm gonna go outside now and wave my fist at the kids in my lawn
[0:24:45] snafubill: Based is a slang term that originally meant to be addicted to crack cocaine (or acting like you were), but was reclaimed by rapper Lil B for being yourself and not caring what others think of you—to carry yourself with swagger.
[0:24:50] witchhobbit: i HATE rizz lol
[0:24:51] AtkinsOhMy: Muppet
[0:24:53] jkuhl58: Rizzo the Rat, Muppets
[0:24:55] eielwind: rizzo was in grease i think
[0:24:55] Daemavand: Rizzo the rat!!
[0:24:59] AtkinsOhMy: Rizzo the Rat and Gonzo
[0:25:00] Rank7kaiju: Rizz GuckGack from Dimension 20?
[0:25:09] witchhobbit: the term is so dumb to me
[0:25:10] Ujai321: the best thing is, nobody knows. you can google it, and you find 20 different explanations, and they all sound plausible
[0:25:12] Daemavand: Thats because you're cool as Rizzo is wonderful
[0:25:19] mcxoney: sigma
[0:25:21] Ujai321: language is just weird sometimes
[0:25:29] AtkinsOhMy: Also a character in Midnight Cowboy
[0:25:43] itsaaronlol: I miss Legion so much
[0:25:47] OlsargeTV: how do you do, fellow kids
[0:25:54] Marovia: did you know each localization of sesame street had it own big bird which are actually cousins to the original?
[0:25:57] wolfcloudchaser80: It's like the origin of "OK/okay." No one is certain where it came from.
[0:26:12] witchhobbit: LUL
[0:26:14] Ujai321: you calling something 'based' now would be based.
[0:26:15] komolana: @Ujai321 as a qualified linguist i couldnt agree more hazelCry lol
[0:26:19] Ryok: what i picked up rizz is short for charisma... but kids nowadays mostly use it as "skill how good someone is at flirting up someone"? it's kinda weird chrisHmm
[0:26:22] Marovia: do you vear vvigs
[0:26:26] witchhobbit: it's the best
[0:26:35] wolfcloudchaser80: Finally! I'm so glad you finally saw the vigs clip!
[0:26:43] IAmScarlett__: hazel
[0:27:01] IAmScarlett__: if i was to realistically get to 45 and do the order hall campaigns, what level would i get to
[0:27:16] Ujai321: there is more than one Elijah??
[0:27:17] MeowDorei: :o cats
[0:27:36] bustykrabb: listening to that rizz discourse in the background while i run keys was incredibly entertaining
[0:27:53] Kurama__95: The Order Hall quests stop giving scaled exp after 45 for some reason
[0:28:04] cashthb: actually, that would be based
[0:28:13] IAmScarlett__: @Kurama__95 you're probably not in chromie time
[0:28:47] lehmannation2: Legion world quests!!!
[0:28:54] MeowDorei: ya!
[0:28:56] Ujai321: legion has some based zones
[0:28:57] witchhobbit: yess can't wait for legion cup!!
[0:28:58] IAmScarlett__: suramar dragon races when
[0:29:04] DejavuNeony: howling fjord dragonraces would be banger
[0:29:05] Daemavand: you dont want to know
[0:29:07] cashthb: 17
[0:29:08] Ujai321: but that is true of every expanion, really
[0:29:26] dergNwolf: I hope they will go b ack to continents that have races now, I'm super sad they didn't make one in the blackrock mountain
[0:29:33] Kurama__95: @IAmScarlett__ I was, I was leveling through Legion in Chromie time specifically to multitask the Order Hall, but once you reach the "max level" Order Hall quests, they start giving less than 100 xp
[0:30:03] witchhobbit: if i'm going to be city living in wow, suramar would be the one
[0:30:08] dergNwolf: I did PridePog
[0:30:16] witchhobbit: otherwise it's tiragarde sound and stormsong valley all the way
[0:30:18] jgbrit: Just ordered KFC 🍗 🤤
[0:30:30] dergNwolf: it was the first thing I got after getting the toy
[0:30:34] dergNwolf: *I did
[0:30:35] IAmScarlett__: IAmScarlett__ watched 5 consecutive streams this month and sparked a watch streak! wow watched 5 in a row im so proud
[0:30:44] Ujai321: hang on, does the sub counter not count resubs
[0:31:05] solidsnakeocelot: Junior Timekeeper's Racing Belt
[0:31:05] heldtheline: Junior Timekeeper's Racing Belt
[0:31:10] IAmScarlett__: did u get the soul inhaler pets
[0:31:28] big_em_prime: Happy Saturday everyone!
[0:32:05] komolana: was just cosy watching stream and got the fright of my life, someones doing fireworks like a few doors down and ive no idea what the occasion is
[0:32:12] Ujai321: oh, right
[0:33:04] komolana: same lmao, thats why its so terrifying for a second
[0:33:11] witchhobbit: same haha
[0:33:16] komolana: worst part is here it was true once, there was a random gunperson just running across rooves?
[0:33:20] kags158: What are we working on with Anthus?
[0:33:33] Ryok: fireworks are illegal here in germany year round except new years eve and day so it's very weird when people set them off during the rest of the year D:
[0:33:41] kags158: Ahh ok ok. Get it, Anthus!
[0:33:45] foxpuzzlewood: some firew works sent off in the uk in certain areas means the drug dealer has stuff to sell
[0:33:55] dvkJoe: Heyho
[0:34:00] wolfcloudchaser80: Used to live north of LA. It was almost always fireworks, but on occasion, I could tell the bang was different... Glad to not be there anymore.
[0:34:22] MaddiDJ4: @ryok last I checked it’s similar in the states unless you have a permit
[0:34:28] komolana: @foxpuzzlewood woah i would think that could be the case here but they've been going on a while now and also i think it might be coming from a primary school haha
[0:34:34] dvkJoe: I'm fine, cause it's caturday!
[0:34:57] eielwind: i have the same thought as hazel, if i hear a firework i just think well tonight is a night someone could shoot a gun and not notice as easy
[0:35:10] Daemavand: Its really easy to get away with
[0:35:23] Daemavand: unless you set up camp and just set them off for awhile and someone calls it in
[0:35:28] Ryok: yeah... they just drive to poland here D: and then cry when the illegal firework takes 4 of their fingers with it D:
[0:35:39] wolfcloudchaser80: Hope Moose isn't too bothered by them. My pup was terrified of fireworks.
[0:35:43] Arabany: I'm fine till someone's firework end up on my balcony
[0:36:05] Hell_FALKON: Haz, what is your fps?
[0:36:22] komolana: ok i finally just looked it up and its a charity firework show for kids, mystery solved
[0:36:40] anne42: My dog hated firework. We have to give her sedatives when  they happen
[0:36:44] Holyrain_Tin: Hi I'm here for all the purple. *wave*
[0:37:03] Hell_FALKON: Haz, this looks way more than 60
[0:37:05] wolfcloudchaser80: Oh, when my dog lived in LA, sirens were unimportant. After moving to rural Colorado, they turned him into a howler. It was INCREDIBLY cute.
[0:37:15] Ryok: i'm still hoping very much that germany decides to make firework completely illegal and just puts on a firework or a drone show or whatever for new years D: i'm so over fireworks
[0:37:23] Cabbageman007: slootSmug wishes he had hair to color
[0:37:28] wolfcloudchaser80: Then he taught the neighbor dog to howl by example.
[0:38:01] IAmScarlett__: anthus looks so good
[0:38:03] IAmScarlett__: can i marry him
[0:38:04] witchhobbit: fireworks are so unnecessary, esp when it affects people with ptsd and animals :(

[0:38:56] judaxtheshaman: Happy Saturday Hazel!
[0:39:00] IAmScarlett__: hazel do you need a wigcap if you have no hair
[0:39:18] gemcutie: Saw the video this morning about Flightstones.  If you don't do mythic is there any other place to spend Flightstones when capped?
[0:39:22] Ujai321: i missed what happened yesterday at 11 at night
[0:39:25] Kurama__95: You could unironically get a sponsor for a wig shop with the success yours are with chat
[0:40:05] furiforever: Can't you buy rep tokens?
[0:40:10] furiforever: at all the Quarter Masters
[0:40:14] IAmScarlett__: ask trixie mattel to get her wigs
[0:40:14] jeffdmk: did you ever watch the dog do the speedrun?
[0:40:20] invadertanz: where do you trade the mettle for knowledge?
[0:40:26] Jiji042: ccatArrive
[0:40:32] komolana: dogs can do speedruns ?! :0
[0:40:37] witchhobbit: i love trixie so much
[0:40:39] jeepurgaming: HI Hazel, I got a lucky drop the other day, I got the Hellfire Infernal Mount from Nighthold
[0:40:40] wolfcloudchaser80: I didn't know how to convince you to watch that clip with you being so careful about delving into YT vids. I had a pretty good feeling you'd love it.
[0:40:46] furiforever: @invadertanz Vendor next to the crafting order person
[0:41:41] IAmScarlett__: how do you get to level 72
[0:41:58] Kurama__95: You could do the Time Rifts on Boy to fish for the warlock customizations
[0:42:00] IAmScarlett__: answer: wait till the war within
[0:42:04] loutoro: did I do the !drops command right?   ty for the tome of teleportation addon recommendation I love it!  hazelLove
[0:42:07] Ujai321: just to go into a little detail: there was a run at AGDQ, where a dog 'played' the game. the game being a puzzle game where you need to push and hold buttons. the most amazing thing about this story really is that the run is about 30 minutes, and the dog is a shiba, and he was focused the entire time
[0:42:16] Ujai321: lots of ham and cheese as rewards
[0:42:24] Arabany: You've mentioned a quest line for the dig event. But I can't find any quest besides the weekly on 5000 fragments.

[0:42:54] Daemavand: Why insist on pugging it organically if the goal is to blast through it?
[0:42:56] jeffdmk: There is one
[0:43:08] Kurama__95: There are 2 Felhound skins that drop from Time Rifts only
[0:43:12] Ujai321: it is very cute
[0:43:18] lumaday: that is the second time ive heard about the time rift farm this week. I never knew either.
[0:43:54] jeffdmk: Also keys have spirits?

[0:44:33] cashthb: researchers imo
[0:44:57] Hell_FALKON: how old is the cat?
[0:45:02] jgbrit: I made damn sure I got the primalist fire set pronto
[0:45:03] jeffdmk: They will change it in like 10 years
[0:45:17] cashthb: just kill them fast enough I guess, killing is all you need to do there, on researchers you have a lot of running around
[0:45:30] AztraTheSupermage: And it sucks that it's the only place where you can get the schematic for the other craftable ring. It has a drop chance of just 1%.
[0:45:43] eielwind: i did *just* enough primalist futures to get everything and not a second more
[0:45:46] SavageNoble: Hazel I just watched your new video and here you are in real time gdqMindBlown

[0:46:43] SavageNoble: My dog's name is Kira and I call her Kiwa, so no one really knows their real name
[0:46:45] jeffdmk: is calling you human okay?
[0:46:47] heldtheline: Oh, I love your nails! hazelOmg

[0:48:16] wolfcloudchaser80: At least as of last week.
[0:48:36] IAmScarlett__: would you say dreamsurges arent that worth doing
[0:48:38] aviously5764: hiiii :3
[0:48:42] IAmScarlett__: like gear wise
[0:49:27] heldtheline: Hochenblume is dirt cheap, it's nice as a scribe for milling.
[0:49:48] wolfcloudchaser80: @IAmScarlett__ I'd say they're only worth it if you have a slot or two that are badly out of date, like sub-400 ilevel.
[0:49:56] IAmScarlett__: like on a fresh 70
[0:49:56] eacker70: I’ve been away from dragonflight for about 4-5 months what advice do you have to catch up?
[0:50:08] Hala1961: Good Morning from Australia
[0:50:23] IAmScarlett__: also i found out that i dont need to kill fyrakk to finish the 10.2 campaign
[0:50:33] witchhobbit: its good for alts/fresh 70s and collectables
[0:50:36] Kurama__95: Dreamsurge gear is only better than the campaign one because you can catalyze it for free for S2 tier
[0:50:39] witchhobbit: theres a mount, pets, toys
[0:50:45] Aseopp: Good morning
[0:51:11] Aseopp: I was farming yesterday
[0:51:14] IAmScarlett__: but cant you catalyse the campaign gear into tier

[0:51:38] eielwind: it took me SO LONG to understand minesweeper
[0:51:52] wolfcloudchaser80: For non raid/mythic gearing, I recommend doing the Superbloom, 5-seed-planting quest, and the Aiding quest in Emerald Dream every week.
[0:52:01] Arabany: I still do not know it
[0:52:04] Marovia: do you remember the first week of nazjatar when the bejewled world quest was stupid hard
[0:52:07] Arabany: Not that I really wanted to
[0:52:11] univers4L11: mine sweeper in darkmoon faire now
[0:52:14] Ujai321: i dont super enjoy minesweeper, because there is a chance you  just loose on the first try, and i hate that
[0:52:23] A1_weaksauce: its super easy when you learn it
[0:52:24] kags158: Windows Pinball!

[0:52:45] Kurama__95: @IAmScarlett__ I tried and couldn't. You can catalyze the rep gear into S3 tier tho
[0:52:47] aviously5764: i was a pinball demon as a kid
[0:52:57] zantos2020: Solitaire was included in Windows to train users how to use a mouse.

[0:53:36] IndigoCat: I played solitaire on my nano too
[0:53:49] witchhobbit: i loved the nanos
[0:53:50] Marovia: its funny how fun is to play solitaire in a device but it feels fucking sad in real life lol
[0:54:15] SavageNoble: Cats have an internal gyroscope stabilizer
[0:54:51] IndigoCat: Nah, I'm old. I played lots of solitaire with cards before computers gluLOL
[0:54:54] Aseopp: After retiring from m+ i thought i would pick up some fuzzy slippers and start crosswords... but maybe solitaire would be the play
[0:55:21] Aseopp: Anyone have thoughts on ther duck slippers from the blizz store?
[0:55:28] jgbrit: Monopoly... All buy, no sell
[0:55:42] witchhobbit: exactly hahaaa
[0:55:44] goplacidly56: I still play it with Grandson lol
[0:55:48] Marovia: i mean as random as poker is, good players win more, so the same can be said about monopoly
[0:56:05] Daemavand: That is a much more fun way to play Monopoly
[0:56:09] aviously5764: my favorite monopoly piece is the thimble :3
[0:56:15] Marovia: the dog is BiS
[0:56:17] jgbrit: Car is where its at
[0:56:24] SavageNoble: Pretty sure our dog piece got lost so it was all about the car or thimble
[0:56:28] jimbowheat: Top Hat gang!
[0:56:59] Aseopp: Yea, but those slippers
[0:57:03] jeffdmk: Monopoly when played correctly(which is almost never) is a game of politics and negotiation.
[0:57:09] Daemavand: A lot of their gear I find to be... not that nice either
[0:57:11] Daemavand: cheaply made
[0:57:27] Daemavand: but I havent bought from them in years, partially owing to that
[0:57:49] Aseopp: haha
[0:57:51] SavageNoble: Whoa
[0:58:03] Aseopp: derpy indeed
[0:58:11] Daemavand: Yeeeeeeah I'd rather pay that for a local artisan, personally, thats a lot for something mass produced
[0:58:31] jgbrit: I recently bought some new socks... as if they had 33% bamboo 😍
[0:58:43] heldtheline: They'd be cool if they were proper shoes.
[0:58:43] gemcutie: Randomly found a backpack from Blizzard Global Insights.... Score!
[0:58:58] wolfcloudchaser80: If someone invents a slipper material that stays fluffy and wonderful after extended time, they'll win a Nobel Prize.
[1:00:25] Aseopp: I thought I was the only person who brought my own slippers, so nice to know im not alone
[1:00:48] delulu_4_u_boo: cozy feet are essential
[1:00:55] IAmScarlett__: i fully was going to buy gear from the AH but im trying to break that habit
[1:01:03] Aseopp: I have heard of this, and im not really comfy in used slippers
[1:01:12] Aseopp: haha commieslippers
[1:01:23] witchhobbit: yeah slippers are like socks for me
[1:01:31] gemcutie: How many other people wore those cozy slippers
[1:01:41] Crimzon7: thats common in japan, wear slippers inside
[1:02:39] goplacidly56: LL Bean slippers are the best

[1:03:16] eielwind: did the total sub counter reset? wasnt it at like 880+?
[1:03:30] witchhobbit: i go barefoot as much as possible. i could be a hobbit
[1:03:54] Marovia: why? the same reason you dont get "based"
[1:04:02] heldtheline: @eielwind Yeah, it was at 883.
[1:04:08] Ujai321: it's total subs, so when a sub lapses (ie prime after a month), it goes down again
[1:04:19] witchhobbit: especially as a kid, which is typical but i remember everyone asking me why my feet were black...barefoot all the time outside LUL
[1:04:30] Aseopp: I have not looked at a catalogue for so long, sounds cozy
[1:04:31] kags158: Like a print catalog archieologist (I butchered that spelling)

[1:11:47] SavageNoble: I'm in my kitchen renovation phase right now which reminds me I need to check if my cabinets are on sale
[1:11:49] flippiney: Watching listing is a good tool tho, It keeps you in the know about how the market is
[1:12:05] foxpuzzlewood: for me its the garden with mine
[1:12:13] Daemavand: @Aseopp Several lol. One to Europe that wont end up happening because indeed, too expensive
[1:12:14] Ryok: well even my 452 frost dk (which deals a lot less dmg than my ret and fury) can kill the last boss in NW fast enough so i guess i got another mount to farm every week with 5 characters yagaH
[1:12:20] SavageNoble: Middle of the country sounds nice and secluded
[1:12:25] MetaD42: What does the term mean, dream llife?
[1:12:32] Dknessfalls: gardening when u have a house is a nice hobby to obsess about
[1:12:48] ThisIzD: :D
[1:13:00] SavageNoble: Does the sourdough phase come before or after the challah phase
[1:13:13] skeletonetiquette: yeah that does not sound like a good idea xD
[1:13:37] brynkthenice1: I am making my first loaf of bread from  my homamade starter today.

[1:16:59] LKatey75: I have to run errands today and I don't wanna. :(
[1:17:04] SavageNoble: Doing Legion content on a 70 really makes me wish there was an option to scale stuff to your current level, even if you don't get relevant rewards

[1:19:11] witchhobbit: i think its great
[1:19:11] Elrathir: oh she noticed :D
[1:19:14] Kurama__95: I would love a tuned up SoO for the mount, way better than just buying it (I don't own it)
[1:19:18] Deloria: If you had to put in work for it, I think that's probably the best route. Otherwise what's the point of doing content if things will all be free? Because I didn't like putting up with jerks for content xD
[1:19:20] pet_pepi_rus: if they put the grove warden back I will freak out (positively)
[1:19:22] Sharkeys: eh i mean having it and all of the other aotc mounts for years i dont see the issue.
[1:19:22] Ryok: i got the mount back in the day and i don't mind if they add aotc mounts to it... hell i want them to add the naxx meta achievement protodrakes because it's absolute BS they were the only ones ever to be removed
[1:19:28] Marovia: can we get the chicken mount on TCG
[1:19:35] Marovia: trading post*
[1:19:35] witchhobbit: i mean are people still mad about the TCG mounts?
[1:19:54] jeffdmk: silently
[1:19:55] witchhobbit: lol true
[1:20:10] SavageNoble: Not mad enough
[1:20:14] witchhobbit: sairaLUL
[1:20:20] cashthb: tcg is different, you didn't have to "earn" it imo
[1:20:22] Marovia: mods do a poll
[1:20:25] blissy416: i dont understand the argument for why these things shouldnt be brought back, espcially after years
[1:20:30] witchhobbit: none of this would make me quit haha
[1:20:40] PunksRocks: You are not using any aura :D
[1:20:41] witchhobbit: @blissy416 exactly
[1:20:44] Ryok: i mean you still got the actual aotc achievement to brag PrideShrug
[1:20:58] heldtheline: Yeah, I bought some of the shop mounts they've given away and it's nothing I'm upset over.
[1:21:01] Rendwee: People are mad that the TCG mounts existed, people are mad that they are on the BMAH after they spend real $$ on it, people are mad that they're being given away as a drop/on prime loot after spending $$/gold on it
[1:21:09] shaenawow: there are so many mounts, most ppl wouldn't know an AOTC mount if they saw it

[1:21:15] Marovia: longboi going away was the weirdest thing because it was already expensive
[1:21:19] Aseopp: Brutasaur.. that is my favorite dinosaur.
[1:21:20] witchhobbit: @Rendwee true hahah
[1:21:29] blissy416: yeah the original earners will still have their achievments
[1:21:31] Perkolate: pixels in the long run.
[1:21:31] jeffdmk: some people view collecting as competitive
[1:21:37] cinder_elliot: how long have i been gone that you have the luxurious long hair? #Slay
[1:21:59] heldtheline: !wig
[1:21:59] Streamlabs: it's a wig
[1:22:12] cinder_elliot: OHHHHH
[1:22:14] Marovia: can we get pandaria challenge gear?
[1:22:14] cinder_elliot: LOL
[1:22:17] cashthb: I don't care about anyone but me, so I don't care if they care don't about my achievments
[1:22:18] Deloria: I find it frustrating that the only prestigious things given out are pve, but never pvp.
[1:22:18] cinder_elliot: looks EXCELLENT
[1:22:30] IndigoCat: People need to come to grips with the fact that this is now a 20 year old game. It doesn't make a lot of sense to have assets that are 10-15 years old and nobody has any way to earn them anymore
[1:22:30] Elrathir: I just think AotC mount being on the Trading Post is kinda boring. I'd rather it be a reward from Timewalking Siege of Orgrimmar, ya know?
[1:22:55] IndigoCat: @Elrathir I agree
[1:23:05] Kurama__95: As someone who started WoW in 2020, there are several collectables that I just never had access to that I'd love to have, but buying it off for tender is just boring, wish they'd bring back a scaled challenge
[1:23:18] pet_pepi_rus: I mean it was just datamined but wasn’t the price for the AOTC mount was like 8K Temders?
[1:23:23] N3f4ri0u5: people just mad of their sentimental value being taken away, by them just giving them away in the trading post i guess
[1:23:36] jeffdmk: I know that is one reason i do way less current content
[1:23:37] Klausnomi72: Aura
[1:23:38] Deloria: I find it already hard enough to find groups :( So I worry the current groups won't care as much because it's not as much urgency to put in effort
[1:23:53] Sparticle100: did they ever make that enchant illusion from the re release of MC available yet?
[1:24:06] blueboywiz: hazel im not going to lie this twitch drop is very meh
[1:24:08] Marovia: there should be like a 10 year limit for things being fomo
[1:24:18] Deloria: @Sparticle100 The rag one? I thought it was in the winter event each year.
[1:24:24] KodiakJedi: If they are going to bring back old AOTC mounts or Glad mounts...they should be recolors and not what you get from the original event / achievement
[1:24:25] pet_pepi_rus: I mean it was just datamined but wasn’t the price for the AOTC mount was like 8K Temders?
[1:24:26] IndigoCat: I agree it might lose a little shine, but how many people are going to want to wait years for something to come back around again if they don't go for the current content now
[1:24:31] doriath21: I think they could at least change the color.
[1:24:34] jgbrit: I don't let fomo decide what I grind for. If I want it I want it. If I don't I don't, whether I can get it again or not

[1:24:38] cashthb: btw, how many of the people that "don't mind the mount on the trading post" didn't even play back in mop; next month they should put the slime cat on the trading post to find out!
[1:24:56] importedrains: importedrains subscribed with Prime. 
[1:24:56] Streamlabs: importedrains just subscribed with Twitch Prime!
[1:25:04] WhippWhapp: o/ Happy Saturday!  The hair reminds me of Cher, @HazelNuttyGames - look s great!
[1:25:10] Rendwee: Oh I'd love the slime cat to go on the trade post and I did the fated raids to get it lol
[1:25:12] dergNwolf: I wanted that mount but I tried too late to get into flex raiding gaySad
[1:25:14] blissy416: i doubt theyll ever add things to the trading post that costs more tenders than what you can earn in that month
[1:25:32] Perkolate: I absolutely love the whole "I speak for everyone on this" takes that ppl are goin wild with.
[1:25:35] Sparticle100: @Deloria yeah the one that dropped off rag when they released MC as we were like lvl 100 or somethin
[1:25:37] MackPlays: I don’t get fomo myself. That’s life you can’t have everything and do everything. You’re gonna miss stuff
[1:25:38] skizzoskilz: kisses from Spain prety gurl!!!!
[1:25:38] witchhobbit: i like the idea of there being a  time limit of some kind for bringing back fomo things yeah. like dont do if its only been a few years. not a bad idea
[1:25:41] Kurama__95: @cashthb You overestimate how many people actually care about the "challenge" of obtaining vs simply having it
[1:25:59] Siks_: the mop aotc mount is so basic that I find it hard that most people will ever even use it :D
[1:26:01] Marovia: whatever happened with that light demon
[1:26:07] Siks_: hard to believe*
[1:26:08] witchhobbit: true
[1:26:11] beefydaddie: yeah, i missed out on the long boi
[1:26:16] witchhobbit: sairaLUL
[1:26:17] beefydaddie: was too poor
[1:26:19] MackPlays: Lol yea
[1:26:20] Eirchi: Hi Hazel! Floyd here now!
[1:26:28] Daemavand: Agreed. And that realizaiton is important, as it'll teach you how to prioritize
[1:26:35] Istarimar: where is this? Ii've been away for a while
[1:26:37] Daemavand: which is a skill IMO
[1:26:38] importedrains: Light based nathrazim are a joke
[1:26:48] freshtomillions: do u think getting the 6 month or 12 month subscription to wow better then doing a subscription every month
[1:26:55] Marovia: wasnt lothraxion in league with sire denathirous?
[1:27:24] importedrains: @freshtomillions  6 month and 12 month give regular rewards
[1:27:36] ghostie1995: yeah i heard bellular talk about lothraxion
[1:27:38] Eirchi: We were on a break!
[1:27:49] ghostie1995: i dont know if they ever went deeper with that story
[1:28:15] wolfcloudchaser80: There's no monetary difference between the 6 and 12 month, unless they changed that. So no real point to do 12 over 6.
[1:28:23] pet_pepi_rus: is the paladin class mount the last one you need for all classes?
[1:28:28] Rendwee: I should finish my class hall mounts but instead I'm going crazy doing pandaria archaeology achievements.. its definitely a lot better being able to dragon ride between digsites but still a bit boring lol
[1:28:52] MaddiDJ4: made the 5 year old I’m watching scrambled eggs. he acted like I was an idiot for thinking those were normal eggs
[1:29:03] jgbrit: The 12 month Murloc mount
[1:29:08] MaddiDJ4: there was. the giant murloc mount

[1:30:29] cinder_elliot: you can do it
[1:30:41] MaddiDJ4: I only ever got the Druid mount, which doesn’t even count as a mount
[1:30:43] Kurama__95: You need to talk to Khadgar back in Dalaran to skip-complete the intro
[1:30:51] wolfcloudchaser80: On the shaman mount you're literally surfing on an elemental
[1:30:58] beefydaddie: my was Tauren Shaman

[1:31:50] Darknexr: dadghar rp is necessary
[1:32:10] Aseopp: So speedos on the paladin
[1:32:19] Marovia: cant wait for Kaghdar and Magni teaming up in TWW to make us insane
[1:32:23] Sharkeys: i just looked at the achievement and you got the warwolf from normal or heroic. i
[1:32:28] Eirchi: Amazing how many people are doing things in Shadowlands... it's busier than the Dragon Isles
[1:32:32] Aseopp: short shorts lol
[1:32:36] dergNwolf: I'm so happy with how many random Pandaren NPCs are at the digs for the azerothian archives tippiComfy
[1:32:47] IndigoCat: That is definitely a look
[1:32:54] SavageNoble: SL players are a special club

[1:33:01] IndigoCat: I love your transmogs
[1:33:08] witchhobbit: yeah i constantly see people in SL rn
[1:33:11] palomo_kun: i skipped shadowlands so i go there sometimes for mounts and things
[1:33:40] MaddiDJ4: ah my sl priest. flash concentration was such a good time
[1:33:52] SavageNoble: I'm still grinding out the Korthia transmog set
[1:34:05] Terra___l: i would love if they reintroduce the orderhalls
[1:34:07] alycynde: Eventually need to go back to ZM and get all of those build-a-pets and mounts
[1:34:08] Rendwee: I need to do some protoform synthesis farming to clean out my reagent bank
[1:34:14] Daemavand: lol\
[1:34:15] witchhobbit: yeah transmog is the hardest to get in sl
[1:34:21] Veranteja: a lot of people are grinding zereth for the motes
[1:34:29] witchhobbit: a lot of it u have to be in certain specs too
[1:34:32] samxox: I hated flash concentration having a maintenance buff irks me
[1:34:32] Kurama__95: When we're strong enough to solo SL raids for transmog, we'll be swimming in Anima and THEN I'll collect everything for every armor time savixKEKW
[1:34:43] skeletonetiquette: one of the very few that truly enjoyed Torghast >.>
[1:34:45] MaddiDJ4: I just liked big heals fast. I was parsing like 5 but i liked having no cast time
[1:34:54] skeletonetiquette: but it was so much fun!
[1:35:03] Rendwee: Torghast is cool now that were extremely OP :)
[1:35:18] MaddiDJ4: if you weren’t farming stygia it was great
[1:35:31] MaddiDJ4: wait no, soul ash
[1:35:33] Perkolate: oh no your snacks
[1:35:46] Arabany: Flash concentration was good, I like it. But then again I've never spammed it just to be at full stacks, I treated it like a nice bonus to my usual healing style
[1:37:27] Ryalz: what's that addon? never seen it before
[1:38:02] Arabany: it is questie, is it not?
[1:38:06] Arabany: a part of it

[1:41:54] elliongrey: Do planted seeds save even after you've logged out for the night? I noticed that I cam ein one day and I had rewards to pick up lol
[1:42:00] cinder_elliot: mathematically 1, practically it depends
[1:42:04] Zuldak: so if you want another project after getting clsas mounts, you could work on getting the hidden apperences for the class artifacts. The paladin one is a high rez corrupted ashbringer
[1:42:22] cashthb: if you can drink trough a flute it is a drinking straw
[1:42:22] Aseopp: So then does a bottle of water have one hole or two?
[1:42:24] SavageNoble: Oribos is always a mistake
[1:42:36] elliongrey: That's rad
[1:42:42] Eirchi: If there's going to be a Grim Campfire then there should be food that can only be cooked with a Grim Campfire

[1:42:54] SavageNoble: Zero
[1:43:05] Aseopp: No, both answers are correct

[2:12:30] Preschooldayz: as soon as the book comes out I get a cat mustache
[2:12:36] Rendwee: Just become able to see through the cat, then all the problems are resolved
[2:12:43] budapestppp: you radiate such positive emergy hazel! :)
[2:12:51] ghouliett: what the heck this xmog looks so good
[2:12:55] ghouliett: what is that sword
[2:13:21] kuiper_ow: can you show your puppy on stream ?
[2:13:23] wolfcloudchaser80: It's Canada. Children get stuck in beaver lodges, not wells.
[2:14:12] Daemavand: This is the same problem when I encounter a butterfly.
[2:14:31] megthemage: Hi Hazel and chat!! VirtualHug hope you're doing well
[2:15:02] jgbrit: That KFC was 20/10
[2:15:09] Aseopp: @megthemage <3
[2:15:17] Rendwee: Some people are mad there's a recolor of a rare island expedition sword on the trading post next month
[2:15:22] heldtheline: Moose visits would be cool sub goals.
[2:15:27] Eirchi: Hazel, do you read cat-themed books?  Like Cat Detective books is an actual genre
[2:15:33] breww: Have you completed all the outland dragonracing achieves?
[2:15:48] ghstface12: Hazel how are you farming your flight stones?
[2:16:05] megthemage: @aseopp TwitchUnity
[2:16:19] Rendwee: Raid gives a lot
[2:16:29] Hojzti: how old is kira now? <3
[2:16:34] Rendwee: Probably best for time investment to do raid
[2:16:57] brynkthenice1: If you do not raid then planting seeds is the fastest way to get flightstones.
[2:17:06] Synkronos: See groups, if they're still running, are decent sources of infinite flightstones
[2:17:07] Rendwee: It does reward a tabard this time
[2:17:10] calessira: getting puppies and adult cats to be friends is an unrivaled exercise in patience hahaha
[2:17:11] ghstface12: you ever re-do your speed set for your Druid?
[2:17:12] ghouliett: cat teeth brushed succesfully
[2:17:12] pet_pepi_rus: it gives title
[2:17:13] Veranteja: i think you can get tabard from outland achievement
[2:17:38] Rendwee: The Ruby Riders of Azeroth Tabard and Outland Racer title from getting gold on all
[2:17:51] Daemavand: It's hard to chill when you have so much love to give!
[2:17:58] Daemavand: Thats tragic napkins are delicious
[2:17:59] tychediam: caturday is my favorite day of the week
[2:18:05] calessira: now THAT is a dog accomplishment deserving a gold medal HAHA
[2:18:14] univers4L11: butt tabards
[2:18:15] Aseopp: @Daemavand lol
[2:18:16] Asteria629: I have a 3 year old german shepherd who also wants to love the small spicy dogs in the house
[2:18:36] Rendwee: Tabards can be fun to tmog with the right stuff
[2:18:37] Neltalie: Do u enjoy the Trial of Style events?
[2:18:42] witchhobbit: i'm hoping they update the old tabards to the new style
[2:18:42] calessira: @Asteria629 HAHAHA this is so relatable
[2:19:04] megthemage: What are you working on today?
[2:19:09] SaltyMurl0c: have you got the blood knigth set since youre a BE paladin
[2:19:10] Eirchi: East German Shepard or West German Shepard?
[2:19:12] witchhobbit: although i dont need all of them...the new tabard style is just super nice
[2:19:15] dergNwolf: yeee agree
[2:19:17] Neltalie: omg i wish that too, and also should be so easy for them to add more prompts
[2:19:26] Rendwee: I stopped having all the druid sets completed because they added a belt for the antorus set to trial of style :(
[2:19:39] SavageNoble: Careful, next step above Highlord is apparently Lich King
[2:19:46] OnyxPenumbra: did they lower the requirements for the mounts? or make them account wide?
[2:19:46] Zuldak: didnt the paladins help priests in the priest campaign?
[2:20:04] tianyi021: Are you doing the class order campaign ?
[2:20:06] megthemage: Noice!! Legion class collecty is a must
[2:20:08] XDaMaGeRs: @HazelNuttyGames  what do you say about them making dragonriding usable everywhere? Doesn´t it make mount collection kinda boring because you won´t use the mounts? :D that was it for me
[2:20:28] Veranteja: quest added in 9.2.5 i think? where you get recolour of the antorus paladin set
[2:20:51] Dknessfalls: i wish Legion lasted a bit longer, it was such an amazing expansion
[2:20:53] Eirchi: The class mounts have a special mounting animation
[2:20:58] pet_pepi_rus: you also get a sick silver moon spear mog
[2:21:04] tianyi021: It actually counts towards the meta acheiv
[2:21:51] Dknessfalls: i think Warlocks get the most class mounts
[2:21:58] Rendwee: For some reason it counts toward the meta regardless I'm pretty sure
[2:22:15] Zuldak: Im a druid and dont even use mounts but i still collect em
[2:22:22] Dknessfalls: @Rendwee it does, i remember farming Legion Order Halls to hit 600 mounts back in the day
[2:22:22] CountNagraz: love your hair Hazel
[2:22:30] elliongrey: yeah, classic flying still has a number of applications. Dragon Riding is far too fun for it to be restricted to the dragon isles
[2:22:38] Eirchi: They just need to make dragons hover
[2:22:40] Webbley: Nah, I think Pallys get 4?
[2:22:40] XDaMaGeRs: ye that would be cool! :D
[2:23:04] witchhobbit: i really love the new gryphon, it flies really nicely
[2:23:07] elliongrey: @Eirchi Well, they do kind of. It just costs vigor
[2:23:22] Rendwee: Kinda goofy some classes had different colors and some classes had color changing based on spec
[2:23:29] pet_pepi_rus: shaman, mage, priest, dk, and warrior changes depending on spec
[2:23:47] Rendwee: Would be nice to pick the shaman one regardless of spec
[2:23:49] Zuldak: want to hear something silly? a druid collecting mog and mounts which are pretyy much useless to them
[2:23:52] Dknessfalls: warriors get 1 but at least we got free ports around the Broken Isles, so cant complain lol
[2:24:03] witchhobbit: i wish they just gave them all diff colors rather than color changing
[2:24:12] Rendwee: great northern elderhorn
[2:24:24] sence_00: man do i ever understand why you are doing like 1 solo shuffle per day
[2:24:32] sence_00: just managed 4/6 but whew, takes a lot
[2:24:34] Dknessfalls: time to level up a Leatherworker!
[2:24:39] Aseopp: Does that moose fly?
[2:24:44] Zuldak: the LW one is surprisingly involved
[2:24:45] Rendwee: The worst part is just completing the legion profession stuff
[2:25:04] Daemavand: The consistency is whats key
[2:25:28] Dknessfalls: the LW moose mount has a storyline
[2:25:29] Rendwee: I think its BOP
[2:25:34] Rendwee: bop
[2:25:41] Zuldak: its a long questline and you need a lw
[2:25:51] Veranteja: leatherwork yourself and the quest is annoying
[2:26:07] emmsnake: First i find out you don't care for  worgen, now that you don't care for leatherworkers?  :(
[2:26:07] XDaMaGeRs: The only thing i dont like about getting these legion mounts is the mission table :D or what is it called
[2:26:08] anistrasza: I feel like the ones with multiple are less spec specific (besides warlock tbh) I think like the rouge is just 4 slightly different birds which don't really tie to a spec unlike the mage and priest ones
[2:26:15] anistrasza: thats just my idea why some are so different
[2:26:31] Rendwee: I forget that emote exists a lot
[2:26:44] thatguynamedjans: Afternoon, Hazel!! :D
[2:26:44] sence_00: we usually get like, 4 weeks warning to end of a season?
[2:27:03] snafubill: You look great!
[2:27:10] Rendwee: They're kinda just not worth it
[2:27:34] Hippwn: lol stuck
[2:27:42] OnyxPenumbra: lul
[2:27:44] Eirchi: This expansion ruined all professions basically
[2:27:46] sence_00: oh dear
[2:27:52] Danoria: I have fun with my mage engineer 😆
[2:27:57] witchhobbit: does the mount work?
[2:27:57] cashthb: only if you care about money, being able to just recraft your gear when a patch drops is really convenient
[2:27:57] Kurama__95: Armor crafting is fun to be self sufficient on alts, but not that great for goldmaking
[2:28:00] SavageNoble: Haha oh no
[2:28:05] Lluksobad: we need more Legion skips!
[2:28:08] cashthb: you could try to blink out maybe :)
[2:28:13] MaddiDJ4: try mounting the arcanist manasaber
[2:28:14] elliongrey: I had a love/hate relationship for suramar
[2:28:15] witchhobbit: you know the mount that puts you in disguise? idk if u can cheese it that way
[2:28:18] sence_00: I think Suramar rep is required for all these
[2:28:28] medvet03: Try mounting, maybe that will get you out.
[2:28:30] Zuldak: the nightborn are bitter you deleted that mage
[2:28:40] pet_pepi_rus: that’s not even a yikes, that’s an L
[2:28:41] TonyBlokeUK: you have to work through the surumar quest line to get the unlock
[2:28:46] Kurama__95: savixKEKW
[2:28:58] Daemavand: Wasn't Legion a good time :D
[2:29:04] jgbrit: Push through you'll be glad you did

[2:29:11] Deloria: Wait what is this a part of?
[2:29:28] Daemavand: "this is my life now"
[2:29:29] Aseopp: elf on a shelf ftl
[2:29:34] cashthb: is this that elf in a shelf people keep talking about?
[2:29:37] Daemavand: sooooooo solo shuffle? :D
[2:29:41] Deloria: Nooo, I still need to do that  bit I skipped it on that toon lol
[2:29:43] TonyBlokeUK: bonus if you run through the suramar quest line you unlock their mount too
[2:29:44] Deloria: *but
[2:29:51] megthemage: @aseopp LOL
[2:29:55] Eirchi: Solo Shelfle
[2:29:55] Rank7kaiju: big elf on small shelf
[2:30:08] LouOfc: Are u sure? i dont remember doing that on my pala alt when doing order hall for mount
[2:30:12] Webbley: Hottest Elf on a Shelf that i've ever seen :D
[2:30:15] SaltyMurl0c: (sorry for slow repyl i was healing in adungeon) the blood knight set is when you are exaulted with silvermoon, go speak to the Belf next to the portasl in oribos and its a really awesome questline and if you do it on a paladin you get a unique dark red and black set
[2:30:38] SaltyMurl0c: its not linked to the heritage
[2:30:44] sence_00: there is a Blood Knight one too, starts in Oribos from Liadrin
[2:30:52] tigerstripes__: I am loving the color of that hair combine with your pink jacket!!!! I'm kinda obsessed!
[2:31:00] tigerstripes__: combined*
[2:31:32] elliongrey: I just spammed RBG's for honor - you can win like 3-4 and be done for the week xD
[2:31:55] elliongrey: Though, I recall solo shuffle gives a fair amount of honor too
[2:32:24] elliongrey: Super toxic"? lol
[2:32:25] elliongrey: Yeah
[2:32:32] sence_00: was watching a Max video yesterday and he was saying RGB players are the most toxic humans alive
[2:32:51] sence_00: guess RBGs would require voice?
[2:33:11] Synkronos: Solo shuffle is less toxic, cos if someone is actually bad, then everyone else just gets wins
[2:33:30] elliongrey: or under geared. ^
[2:33:36] Synkronos: Unless it's a healer that's the weak link, then all the dps get a tie, and the other healer wins. But there's no real downside to anyone else
[2:33:44] elliongrey: As soon as we identify a target, that's the target everyone picks. It's inevitable lol
[2:33:53] le_juhong: Friends what is hazel's paladin name again ? I'd like to look at his armory page
[2:33:54] cashthb: you should try to just embrace toxicity, you can't fight it, atleast laugh at it
[2:33:56] Synkronos: Sure sorry, I didn't mean 'bad' by skill, I meant 'an easy target'
[2:34:00] TonyBlokeUK: what's the average attemp tries for the Ptterodax egg?
[2:34:22] MonsterMommaBear: go Hazel go!
[2:34:41] hartxoxo: TwitchConHYPE TwitchConHYPE TwitchConHYPE
[2:34:57] le_juhong: Thankkkks
[2:35:21] LouOfc: @TonyBlokeUK i got mine pretty quick, but dk if that was luck
[2:35:30] elliongrey: BAM
[2:35:30] Zuldak: any update on twitch emotes? ya got a lot of slots?
[2:35:31] Aseopp: LL Bean has so many slippers. Does anyone remember which ones were mentioned earlier?
[2:35:48] elliongrey: what is that lol
[2:35:49] TonyBlokeUK: must have been as i'm on attempt 700 atm
[2:36:06] LouOfc: Oh rip
[2:36:40] KaminaBro: the heck is this BAN soundeffect?
[2:36:55] le_juhong: !server
[2:36:56] TonyBlokeUK: i've never been very lucky though except when i met my wife ;)
[2:36:57] elliongrey: Oh I thought they were saying "BAM!"
[2:37:04] flodwra: off topic, I am at 6789 attempts at the Infinite Time reaver mount ... lol
[2:37:26] TonyBlokeUK: jeez
[2:37:28] Rendwee: @flodwra I wonder if it'd just be better to farm all the dungeon mounts except that one and then try to get the megadungeon mount lol
[2:37:28] Eirchi: that's people being banned from the chat
[2:38:38] Zuldak: yeah the bans give hazel an in game healing buff
[2:38:39] elliongrey: If I wanted to start to learn to heal, what class would you recommend?
[2:38:58] mcxoney: @flodwra i just got it from quantum courser xD
[2:39:03] elliongrey: ah okay cool! I was planning on levelling a shadow priest so that works for me
[2:39:05] TonyBlokeUK: oh i did get the green proto from my first egg
[2:39:06] jeffdmk: It is for sure the beginner healer spec
[2:39:09] Eirchi: It's why Hazel needs more subs, more healing buffs
[2:39:12] Zuldak: i think you should learn to heal as a blood DK. You do more healing than many traditional healers anyway
[2:39:20] aerissune: Wait, I started watching stream and fell asleep, I wake up and you have new hair! Love it!
[2:39:23] jgbrit: I personally learnt on Druid and I found it very easy
[2:39:55] tildo03: I found disc easier than holy.  I got frustrated with holy very quickly and went back.  Why must you turn your stream into a house of lies...

[2:40:05] witchhobbit: @jgbrit same and then i started learning priest healing
[2:40:12] tildo03: but I am planning on leveling a holy now.
[2:40:26] jgbrit: I feel like Holy priest has too many cooldowns and I get overwhelmed
[2:40:29] jskillz777: DRUIDs are op in pvpv
[2:41:28] witchhobbit: yeah holy has so many options and i feel like i need to press them all
[2:42:48] witchhobbit: oh nice
[2:43:08] Alannalouwho: what was the name of it again?
[2:43:13] Alannalouwho: if anyone knows?
[2:43:13] Daemavand: Those websites analyzing that data are incredible to me
[2:43:23] Daemavand: what a time to be a gamer
[2:43:46] Synkronos: You can shapeshift out of hex, right? Your form buttons weren't disabled
[2:44:01] ThrusterNYC: why are they trying to kill your warrior instead of you, the healer?
[2:44:18] HazelNuttyGames: https://lorrgs.io/
[2:44:46] Synkronos: I thought you could shapeshift out of a poly or a hex even after it landed?
[2:45:22] elliongrey: UGH. That shaman lasso stun is so annoying lol
[2:45:53] jkuhl58: I wanna try solo shuffle but I hate pvp lol
[2:46:50] Synkronos: Yeah, searches are all saying you can shapeshift out of a poly even if you don't immune it by being in-form for the cast landing
[2:47:35] elliongrey: I want to get more into rated pvp again, but I am going to wait for the solo rbg
[2:47:44] cashthb: I automatically dislike any domain that uses .io at this point. Like, is hosting from the seychelles that cheap?!
[2:47:48] Synkronos: It's been like that forever afaik >_>
[2:47:50] Kurshtin: Long time viewer - first time chatter. Much love Hazel!
[2:47:52] cashthb: foken' url fashion
[2:48:44] suic132: They really hate legolant
[2:49:37] indithedog: hazel pvp PogBones
[2:49:47] MonsterMommaBear: Oh-ho! I just got the Zuilan Panther!
[2:50:06] elliongrey: ah yeah 1200 honor. That's as much as an RBG in my experiene so I guess you an spam either. hjaha
[2:50:11] MonsterMommaBear: The dungeon, I'm too lame for the other stuff haha
[2:50:11] IAmScarlett__: how is anthus and his paladin order hall era
[2:50:46] Daemavand: But he'll know that elf after!
[2:50:57] Daemavand: but yeah seriously the legion grinds are awful lol
[2:51:07] IAmScarlett__: i need a good youtube guide for the paladin order hall
[2:51:14] GreenArrowed: aw he was an elf on a shelf

[2:52:01] IAmScarlett__: naur,,,,i want the order hall armor....
[2:52:10] IAmScarlett__: that has immediately turned me off
[2:52:14] ghouliett: dude do u remember the suramar achievement that did NOT age well?
[2:52:16] sence_00: I mean the WQ bonus thing is up this week so it might be worth doing a bunch of suramar WQs
[2:52:22] Daemavand: whoooooooa thats awesome
[2:52:24] ghouliett: ther was an achievement called..Insurrection
[2:52:27] flippiney: I felt that "stuck on a shelf" felt like of all the things that happened that was the worst
[2:52:39] IAmScarlett__: yeah the achievement for nightborne unlock
[2:52:51] ghouliett: it was called insurrection
[2:52:57] ghouliett: kinda didnt age well IMO

[2:53:07] Borship: woah what addon is that :)
[2:53:08] elliongrey: that was a neat hunter trik

[2:53:33] IAmScarlett__: @ghouliett girl what

[2:56:32] IAmScarlett__: @ThrusterNYC dream wardens if your a raider
[2:56:55] sence_00: are there any classes in PVP this season that you find really frustrating to play against?
[2:56:57] ghouliett: please bring back tea mugs and metal straws to ur stream <32
[2:57:02] sence_00: I remember last time it was misweavers
[2:57:10] ThrusterNYC: are there any DF vendors that sell pets for charms?
