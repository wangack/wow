[1:17:41] ritsrawr: @yumytv on fort  Galk's fall...... do you dispel the AOE dots in mid or do you just heal through the ticks? i have been just basically insta dispelling one and then popping a cd but someone commented the other day it may be better to just let them fall off and the people spread highest i've done galk on is 24... so im thinking 26-27 we might be entering one shot territory

[1:38:34] Italicuss: what are the practical differences between streaming on twitch vs yt
[1:38:48] msmester1: money

[1:39:13] ShaggySummers: skipping back in stream D:
[1:39:19] Italicuss: ah true vods getting ad revenue is hute
[1:39:22] Italicuss: huge*
[1:39:24] ritsrawr: if Youtube thought they had a real chance at overtaking Twitch they'd dumb a shit ton of money into development
[1:39:24] AvalenaTV: can you stream on both simultaneously?
[1:39:31] uniqueusername7: need to get someone to program a site that merges twitch and youtube chats so you can truly duel stream
[1:39:42] msmester1: you can pause and start you dont have to seach out the current VOD and fking refersh constantly
[1:39:49] waelrick: YT IS SO BIG COMPARED TO TWITCH
[1:39:55] waelrick: sry for caps lol
[1:39:56] Wujoh: Gang activity didn't die?

[1:40:10] jujumann35: are you live on the tube now?
[1:40:10] noldan216: twitch makes no money
[1:40:10] hunterzx: idk i doubt that'll ever happen. every event i see streaming on both,
[1:40:13] uniqueusername7: considering twitch loses money even while piggybacking off AWS i dont think youtube really cares about winning streaming
[1:40:15] msmester1: pornhub will kill twitch Sadge
[1:40:17] spoon_rl: They need to rework the search function for livestreams in youtube if they want a real chance
[1:40:17] hunterzx: gets bigger viewer counts on twitch
[1:40:22] Blane86: isnt the bitrate on yt even better then twitch anyway ?
[1:40:22] oneneoeun: youtube livestreaming just ain't it
[1:40:27] Pubscrub: Youtube has Youtube Music they need to have something like that for gaming to make it easier to find streams

[2:01:06] Basic_3: Hey Growl, my friend on Resto Druid is having trouble healing the drowning debuff on Throne 27-28. Is there any advice to be given there, or just play better?
[2:01:21] zingp1ng: 'everyone started dying' means you accidentally did an oopsie on the big green xD
[2:01:24] luxumbra69: Revitalizing Voodoo Totem
[2:01:37] klondike_wow: xdd
[2:01:37] Aboknes: xD
[2:01:39] Basic_3: Well I told him "Just heal more" but that didn't work. I'm out of options.
[2:01:46] msmester1: just say it ReallyMad
[2:01:48] oakeri: voodoo totem helps but, non fort week makes it easier in general
[2:01:48] Aboknes: "my friend"

[2:02:58] SwissRoles: cries in ele shaman FeelsBadMan
[2:03:02] zolal3: loh*
[2:03:02] ShaggySummers: It's actually Dorki that gets to play with Growl!
[2:03:05] raddington28: this is my first season DPSing on a tanky class after maining shaman all these years. Idk if I can every go back
[2:03:05] msmester1: does outlaw count as tanky?
[2:03:10] Blloood: Cant tell if ur being sarcastic or not XD
[2:03:24] Blloood: "the honor of playing with him"

[2:05:33] Twizited: Hes still in chat KEKW
[2:05:33] Marenjok: drohgoh GIGACHAD
[2:05:42] luxumbra69: Drogoh is built different. it's why he's also a fucking prick. He is good, but he's a douche
[2:05:44] SoberCannibal: drogoh healing, calling, and DOING THE DH SEED last night was crazy
[2:05:44] Valanya11: Grohgoh GIGACHAD

[2:06:02] itslily_y: yeah
[2:06:04] mawji_: i saw he was using the base raid frames last night lmao
[2:06:05] baseboned: he's playing hpal in mdi?!?
[2:06:07] evantengu147: are they trolling?
[2:06:08] baseboned: there's no way
[2:06:10] evantengu147: in that video
[2:06:14] Blloood: ye, how to improve at wow. Spoilers, they dont actually explain how to improve
[2:06:15] Bret36: Yeah they talked about multi classers
[2:06:16] evantengu147: because the thumbnail is them laughing
[2:06:17] msmester1: more shitty ui = better player
[2:06:20] ShaggySummers: Did they bring up @yumytv as an example of someone who needs to improve? :>
[2:06:21] stormz_wow: @baseboned mostly likely disc or mw
[2:06:38] autumnbugle: they mentioned you advocate for recording yourself
[2:06:46] luxumbra69: brother, if there is an HPAL in the mdi, i will mail all my gold to Grom and delete my toons.

[2:06:56] Spritesgud: ya the episode wasnt good lol
[2:06:57] Ferg_6: Max for sure
[2:06:57] ShaggySummers: the episode was actually decent
[2:06:59] luxumbra69: basedg
[2:07:00] Basic_3: I get that for Max, but Dratty is a man of the people
[2:07:01] 16attempts: it kinda boiled down to play m+ and get good logs
[2:07:02] Ferg_6: Dratnos is still pretty good
[2:07:03] Spritesgud: it was "play more, have a pro ui"
[2:07:04] SoberCannibal: hated that their advice on how to improve went straight to addons and weakauras
[2:07:06] Blloood: They actually did use you as an example. Max said he had given you advice about dogding somthing on the 2 dragon pull in dawn of infinite
[2:07:07] waelrick: dratnos is slowly becoming max
[2:07:10] professor_cullman: Max: This 28 Waycrest Tyran is piss
[2:07:15] baseboned: I think Dratnos is a man of the people
[2:07:17] tvilk: @yumytv You said the way to find a group to play with is "just be online and they'll invite you"
[2:07:19] raddington28: I had no idea dratnos was a good player for the longest time
[2:07:24] msmester1: yeh sometimes im like man im trying to do +15 man PepeHands
[2:07:25] c3rby_: 100% agree about max advice
[2:07:33] Milano___: Streaming gives you a good sense of where people need help (through chat)
[2:07:34] pigeonwankenobe: !addons

[2:08:01] Appl3man: when are you geting an invite to be a guest on the poddy C :)
[2:08:01] msmester1: 2 years ago Oldge

[2:08:08] xGuiha: are we resto rerollers? 4Finger
[2:08:09] Blloood: cuz its impossible to just "guess" how a bad player thinks
[2:08:09] CurrentsWoW: CurrentsWoW subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 19 months! the priorities clip is goated
[2:08:21] luxumbra69: Max finally understanding M+ and how some classes just can't live lol. when he realized that DH isnt really that tanky at high levels was pretty funny
[2:08:25] maxwell_313: great name by that paladin
[2:08:27] quuqeli: @yumytv if you had to try to look for a m+ sguad to play with, how would you go about finding one? i am kinda getting tired of pugging keys:P
[2:08:50] Bret36: Think we'll see any no healer, 3dps+aug in the mdi?
[2:08:52] luxumbra69: Classes that just stack vers are too good. the end.
[2:09:01] anaya909: bad players can get good by playing the game.  top players aren't holding you down with some secret strats
[2:09:01] Ferg_6: Get me on the poddy. Im shit and will give great perspective
[2:09:03] ShaggySummers: @quuqeli make friends in pugs, turn them into regulars, invite them over for netflix and chill, push keys
[2:09:03] Satimy: @yumytv I saw Dratnos spitting on LFR raiders in Ogrimmar
[2:09:07] FareweII_: eh PoddyC seems more or less casual friendly, at least they take them in consideration, titanfgore FOR SURE has some 0.1% takes
[2:09:09] luxumbra69: @Bret36 aug can't live without a healer. squishy.
[2:09:12] xGuiha: @quuqeli you pug and add people and eventually when the stars align you find a couple people to play with til there's drama and you guys disband
[2:09:12] HeffaBear: the amount of times you hear ‚Äúrecord yourself and youll get better‚Äù when theyre talking to people who have no idea what theyre doing bad is funny
[2:09:14] xGuiha: then you do it again
[2:09:15] GrimFandango: I don't think they didn't mention any tangible tools or advice (Lorrgs, Kaze, Subcreation, etc), and I would argue actually gave kind of bad advice RE: ignoring certain mechanics
[2:09:19] anaya909: like if you wanna get good, you will.  coaching has nothing to do with it
[2:09:43] c3rby_: coaching can definitely help anaya
[2:09:44] baseboned: record yourself is actually good advice
[2:09:46] xGuiha: @GrimFandango subcreation isn't really a good tool to get better
[2:09:59] RealPeps: i use youtube streams to watch vods of myself and you notice so much shit
[2:10:06] Blloood: Recording yourself NotLikeThis
[2:10:07] tvilk: I'm literally the best player in the world what do you mean
[2:10:08] Outsane: Hey Growl, is the raid at 9 EST again?
[2:10:11] ShaggySummers: I always record myself to see how well i performed. Hate when the girl gets angry about it :(
[2:10:14] autumnbugle: that was the majority of what they talked about on the podcast
[2:10:15] raddington28: I think long time players forget just how hard this game is
[2:10:16] rosca89: @GrimFandango that wasn't what they said, they didn't advocate ignoring mecanics just because, they said that you should ignore mechanics that don't concern you
[2:10:29] decimated___: bursting is so fun :)
[2:10:30] luxumbra69: pally saving bubble for next dungeon nice.
[2:10:36] grudgedgaming: I watch a lot of Growl to learn  ü§£
[2:10:39] ShaggySummers: @decimated___ -r
[2:10:49] lord_konstantine: Are paladin tanks much harder to heal than DH?
[2:11:11] tvilk: It's literally impossible for me to improve I'm playing at max capabilities of the human mind
[2:11:13] GrimFandango: @rosca89 I didn't say they said "ignore mechanics just because"

[2:11:21] ShaggySummers: @tvilk same fr fr
[2:11:29] Blloood: When i am playing i have the illusion that i am a giga chad carrying my team. I dont want to lose that
[2:11:35] mawji_: i just made myself start recording myself once the key was above a certain level, has been helping me realize how much i overuse cds when i dont need to lol
[2:11:39] Blloood: please dont make me record myself
[2:11:40] anaya909: oh i haven't pressed nature's swiftness for 3min
[2:11:55] Sunchaser_911: how stressed are you about tanks pulling big this week with bursting?
[2:12:04] rosca89: @GrimFandango no but you failed to mention the whole context, the point was that you shouldn't track mechanics that are not important for your role, whic is in my opinion actually good advice
[2:12:09] AverageChameleon: damn i got it mixed up
[2:12:10] lord_konstantine: as a tank, most of the time its obvious what I did wrong because I just wiped the team PepeLaff
[2:12:13] mawji_: YEP i am garbage lol
[2:12:14] HeffaBear: @blloood gigachad frfr
[2:12:37] tinyginga: my biggest problem is seeing half the stuff. blizzard is always like ayo what if we made this one shot the same color as the groung lul
[2:12:46] lord_of_beard: is this a good push week?
[2:12:47] rosca89: I've seen so many people track everything they can but sometimes half of that shit doesn't matter for their role
[2:12:51] GrimFandango: @rosca89 lmao, do you want me to write an entire essay in twitch chat? Are you logging onto the internet purely to start arguments?
[2:13:04] Blloood: LEAF!
[2:13:07] Blloood: i love that leaf
[2:13:08] Nickystr1x: i just had a similar conversation with a new SSV at my store, essentially i told them to act in the moment as if everything you're doing is right but then be as critical as you can in retrospect while still being productive
[2:13:09] Confused95_: Ithink its a thing in every game that has a comp side. People think VOD reviewing is for pros and too much work for casual players. But I think it should be other way around. VOD review could be like 80% of the work to improve
[2:13:23] ijuki: Why did I die? My HP reached 0 Kappa
[2:13:31] CurrentsWoW: mhm, because if you tell yourself to change your ui mid key your gonna forget for another week at least
[2:13:31] msmester1: me first time in waycrest wiping cuz cant see shit KEKL
[2:13:36] rosca89: @GrimFandango bruh why are you so defensive, I didn't even say anything bad you just said some wrong shit

[2:14:36] pbnj_kills: i'll at most review my logs but i dont care enough to watch my recordings
[2:14:37] Anderine: That's it for me. Stopped pvping becuase I felt I needed to study and memorize everything. Starting to feel the same in m+
[2:14:42] rosca89: the types of grass lmao
[2:14:45] tvilk: dude i love learning about trees
[2:14:48] msmester1: waht do you mean you cant memorize the electric poles in each country WTFF
[2:15:14] rosca89: wdym you can't recognize mongolian grass

[2:21:20] ShaggySummers: People will stop doing gdkp's obviously
[2:21:25] kesh405: it sounds based, but i hope they actually follow through on it and actually enforce the new policy
[2:21:28] maddy02_: @frendog3 yes
[2:21:28] baseboned: i don't see how they can do anything more than make gdkp advertizing reportable
[2:21:30] ShaggySummers: @ewbrad having people offer gold for loot
[2:21:44] popularviber: @ewbrad raid lead loots everything and auctions it off at end and profits are split between everyone who came
[2:21:50] tikhonnovv: People join the group. I say "Hi". They say "1".
[2:21:56] decimated___: nah just make a centralized discord

[2:22:26] GrimFandango: Imagine RMTing to buy a lvl 25 piece of gear with +4 str +4 stam
[2:22:32] GreenConure: also streamers cant stream gdkp runs anymore and advertise

[3:25:38] Harthad: snowball your way up into 25's and shit
[3:25:48] spujetti: My advice is ask the best players in your guild (if you raid obv) if theyre interested in pushing keys as a team
[3:25:51] MBG_95: @Cruzerthebruzer thats why adding individuals normally works out better

[5:01:02] Elembry_us: invisible orbs are the best
[5:01:11] EmElw: its a weakaura for physical and magical EHP
[5:01:15] zachl_: @zachl_ i do remember i just dont see how a healing meter is a value-based metric
[5:01:20] itsblaine: Penis was dragging behind you and got hit Shruge
[5:01:21] sukoWoW: they should just make portal insta-open for m+
[5:01:23] zachl_: healing meters in m+ are like not real

[5:02:33] ReSeT_VT: @zachl_ just give healers something to look up to man, there's barely any anyway
[5:02:40] baseboned: man new faeline stomp looks SO SWEEEET
[5:02:55] darksos98: i havent done a dungeon on entangling before what does it do? root you in place for some sec?
[5:03:01] zachl_: if ur lookin at healer meters for a basis of how good u are in m+ we got some serious issues to unpack OMEGALUL
[5:03:07] RamblingJosh_: data is data, as long as you keep it in context
[5:03:09] simon11111987: I wonder what Sean kingstone is up to these days, sitting in group finder maybe?
[5:03:15] lord_konstantine: A 3.4K warlock ran in front of the Tyr tank frontal while trying to get to the side opposite of the pillar where the rest of the team was and got evaporated YEP Guess we all have bad days
[5:03:20] baseboned: it's a snare, not root, so slows you, if you dont get out in 8 seconds it stuns you
[5:03:24] zachl_: @darksos98 it initally gives you a 10s circle that slows u, if u fail to walk out or break the slow- you get stunned for 4s
[5:03:30] ReSeT_VT: @zachl_ I look at healer meter when healing because if I look at my party I get depression
[5:03:40] velidien: @zachl_ it was a hurdle i had to overcome mentally honestly. seeing tanks heal near me for some pulls felt like i wasnt doing my job but mentally got over that and its gotten better for me lol

[5:03:57] tinyginga: any pete game play before the raid?
[5:04:09] baseboned: it's the best affix because it's the easiest affix, and yet people still argue that no affixes would be bad, despite people only wanting the easy ones hmmm
[5:04:20] baseboned: delete all affixes!
[5:04:24] justbeachi: what do you think shaman is missing to be meta?
[5:04:27] Blane86: its an affix that can be dangerous in big pulls if you ignore it but its chill
[5:04:35] darksos98: getting into M+ again since legion slowly but surely

[5:05:29] zachl_: @baseboned i think the experience in practice is worse, but the concept of changing the dungeons is better

[5:05:34] ReSeT_VT: !favorite
[5:05:34] Nightbot: rdruid

[5:05:55] itsblaine: The tech
[5:06:12] EmElw: less terrible downsides i think would help
[5:06:20] EmElw: the fact that you die or want to die if incorp/aff goes off
[5:06:21] EmElw: is not good
[5:06:34] monochromator: Huh, I never tried to backstep that
[5:06:34] zachl_: i think bosses should not be effected by sanguine
[5:06:41] zachl_: i think its so troll that it can heal bosses still
[5:07:00] itsblaine: Bosses used to bolster
[5:07:05] baseboned: one week your movement speed is increases by 10%
[5:07:06] EmElw: sanguine not healing mobs when theyre casting would go a long way too
[5:07:11] EmElw: basically removing the terrible  downsides
[5:07:19] zachl_: ooh thats a good idea em
[5:07:24] zachl_: i actually really like that
[5:07:25] baseboned: one week your invised outside of combat
[5:07:48] Nico_vdM: or let the sanguine decrease in size as it either heals or damage
[5:07:54] darksos98: this boss in pugs can be hell if noone kills ads and falls over, ptsd Sadge
[5:07:57] ReSeT_VT: maybe im dumb but i think sanguine  is a fine affix. sure it can be bad in some keys and it adds time to the key but you can play around it
[5:07:57] zachl_: dude u guys are so smart
[5:08:03] zachl_: what a good idea nico
[5:08:05] zedorulol: yo @yumytv did you still plan on doing a zero to hero series?

[5:09:03] zedorulol: some sort of tank
[5:09:03] tinyginga: favorite class of the Xpac?
[5:09:05] darksos98: zero to hero series be popping off on youtube now so good timing, i found you from the SL shaman series :D
[5:09:05] zachl_: i think sanguine should be like judged on how well u can get things out of sanguine, not like, how you pull differently because certain things are bound to get healed
[5:09:06] decimated___: expose this wideBorisSussy
[5:09:07] Vods: Frost DK for sure YEP

[5:53:39] Vods: They also just yeeted 10% of their employees
[5:53:44] nvpal: Well blizzard is in a transition phase atm anyways, layoffs, new ceo etc etc
[5:53:54] RamblingJosh_: Dragonflight been on a barebones team since S3 dropped
[5:53:59] baseboned: there's still whatever the 10.2.6 pirate flag sercret patch is
[5:54:23] lord_konstantine: Yeah after a merger its ogre for a lot of support departments

[5:55:11] Shifter2k: Yep my company just finished a merger in covid and just lost 1.9k employees
[5:55:12] MierkaBlue: it is not just overlaps though, they killed one whole team and most QA and customer service
[5:55:23] Droodensteinburg: most value spirit link of all time
[5:55:32] Emm_Zee: I mean that is bound to happen, as we all know from ambition, when there is an overlap, someone from the team has to leave xdd
[5:55:38] thepleasuremachine: aren't they completely outsourcing customer service?
[5:55:58] Estehr: is shaman an easy healer to play?
[5:55:59] baseboned: wow customer service was shit for years
[5:56:02] lord_konstantine: Doing it all at once calms things down sometimes. Lets say instead of 10% you do 5 and then 5 again. After the second round perceived job security will drop and you might lose a lot of people you dont want to.
[5:56:06] bot_sharlajjn: more likely that 3/4 of those people are low in chain of management
[5:56:10] Vods: @MierkaBlue Also the 10 people who still worked on their old games . . like hots starcraft remastered and stuff Sadge
[5:56:25] MierkaBlue: @Vods ^^ yeah

[6:32:32] baseboned: azure was good eventually, it started real bad tho
[6:32:54] nvpal: ruby had a rough start too
[6:33:33] Naerina: and on that note... VP in F
[6:33:45] IAmSolari: @baseboned maybe I was jaded because I had to farm that dungeon for weapon, but the last boss on AV never felt good
[6:33:48] yctnm: vp should be in a list by itself
[6:33:49] Canwestop: KEKL
[6:34:07] yctnm: curated by the government
[6:34:15] Canwestop: !civcheck jdotb
[6:34:16] Nightbot: jdotb is 2% civilian.
[6:34:20] jessebona: I mean the ability to mount being good would depend on scale too right? If it's a small dungeon walking-wise then mounting doesn't mean much e.g. Grimrail Depot.
[6:34:21] nvpal: dang
[6:34:26] Emm_Zee: HOLY
[6:34:27] IAmSolari: @Nightbot BASEG
[6:34:48] nvpal: explosive Despairge
[6:34:53] nvpal: ptsd
[6:35:00] IAmSolari: algethar deserves S tier because it killed explosive
[6:35:09] greenpy: !civcheck

[6:44:59] skix0: even my dps hated it cause they knew they were dead
[6:45:02] Montiguy: i think they should have all the dungeons in for season 4. But have all the keys have 3 different dungeon. That way it wont be very hard to get specific keys. Score would be based on the top 8 dungeons
[6:45:04] Beckzmed: imagine playing dps

[6:53:32] baseboned: bonemaw is bad
[6:53:44] twish117: if you're sitting here doing keys for 12 hours a day, sbg is dogshit
[6:53:45] dknamey: last boss is fine
[6:53:51] twish117: otherwwise i think its not that bad
[6:53:52] Emm_Zee: Fun fact: Bonemaw was actually not longer than other bosses, but it was so boring time felt slower xdd
[6:54:02] baseboned: I'd rather run shadowmoon 5 times than run temple once
[6:54:19] Canwestop: god yeah
[6:54:23] ImNietono: fax
[6:54:29] AvalenaTV: wdym? we all pushed 20s, we're highkey pushers RAGEY
[6:54:31] nykkou55: SBG was the weekly freebie on the alts
[6:54:37] Canwestop: i always did 8 SMBG/COS keys for vault lmao
[6:54:40] skix0: I mean when u have a full time job and can only get 7 dungeons in a night. I didnt mind lmao
[6:54:42] apocalypse912: who is that alongside dorki, yumi, max and drat?
[6:54:52] nvpal: LET FLY Pepega

[6:55:10] N45TY_69: D
[6:55:12] IAmSolari: I liked Nokhud
[6:55:12] Melancholy_Mode: its like a B
[6:55:12] yctnm: Wokege
[6:55:15] zolal3: nokhud is insane if they remove 1 boss
[6:55:16] skix0: BBBBBB
[6:55:16] nykkou55: nokhud is B for banger
[6:55:18] AvalenaTV: if they fix the skip to last it could be interesting again
[6:55:19] ConchubarOD: @skix0 Man, 7 dungeons in a night is like twice what I can fit in on top of working.
[6:55:22] nvpal: First trashpull as a dps is dopamine fiesta
[6:55:28] Kazoooie: last area in nokhud was kinda cringe though
[6:55:34] skix0: @skix0 I have like light insomnia haha
[6:55:35] Emm_Zee: Nokhud was not outstanding but kinda had nothing too offensive (pun not intended) xdd
[6:55:43] nvpal: @Emm_Zee get out
[6:55:48] ewbrad: Nokhud is mid, B tier
[6:55:52] baseboned: bosses were pretty fun tho

[6:56:25] ronnir51: i made that boss :)
[6:56:26] popularviber: xdd
[6:56:26] skix0: @skix0 Hell yea BASED
[6:56:26] AvalenaTV: storm boss with prevoker in pugs was so hard
[6:56:49] IAmSolari: Thundering could've been a banger if missing it didn't wipe the entire group
[6:57:09] skix0: @AvalenaTV I thot I was just bad but as preworker that boss was impossible for me
[6:57:16] Emm_Zee: Dragonriding > slowass RP flying
[6:57:33] Kazoooie: EleGiggle
[6:57:46] AvalenaTV: @AvalenaTV nah at some point i just went full melee there, it was so hard if you couldnt hit more than 2 ppl with TA haha
[6:57:49] nvpal: oh fuck no
[6:58:08] baseboned: they changed AV already but haven't changed nokhud, you can still fly to the back
[6:58:11] skix0: I want to hear the AV takes
[6:58:20] ConchubarOD: @skix0 sleeping med time soon Okayge
[6:58:35] IAttackYou: prot pal was op af
[6:58:36] Kazoooie: last area trash balance is so out of wack it's crazy that it went live like that

[7:00:32] skix0: we liked AV?????????????
[7:00:43] skix0: AV was ass the first 4 weeks
[7:00:43] AvalenaTV: they fixed AV tho with the jumps no?
[7:00:43] jaegerlamb: av trash
[7:00:44] ewbrad: are you guys insane?
[7:00:46] nvpal: AV was good
[7:00:52] TondaPerger: C for me if we rate based on favorite dungeons LUL
[7:00:53] melonylotseven: this was long as hell and all the bosses sucked
[7:00:54] Destrolisher: big key doers liked av
[7:00:57] Emm_Zee: If AA and AV are not S, nothing can be S really
[7:01:00] eternalsmile: Chatters who say AV is S tier are brainwashed
[7:01:07] ewbrad: okay but what about AV now that the skips have been patched?
[7:01:13] Nerafris: 2 bosses with immune phases, dogshit dungeon.

[7:02:43] nvpal: the ring pulls were great
[7:02:52] IAmSolari: fuck AV
[7:03:03] IAmSolari: last boss sucks for melee
[7:03:03] Nerafris: every single area except the bosses
[7:03:12] IAttackYou: high risk high reward
[7:03:14] IAttackYou: its so fun
[7:03:28] Nerafris: all 4 bosses in that dungeon were straight up unfun
[7:03:39] IAmSolari: azureblade was okay
[7:03:48] Canwestop: any boss with an immune phase makes the dungeon beans

[7:03:52] Canwestop: and AV had 2 of em
[7:03:54] IAmSolari: Kinda liked the rock boss too
[7:04:00] IAmSolari: fuck the last two bosses of AV
[7:04:19] Nerafris: 1st and last boss were despair on melee
[7:04:28] Nerafris: and 2 and 3 are immune phases

[7:05:40] ewbrad: everyone who is normal AV is D
[7:05:42] nvpal: Season 2 was rough
[7:05:46] skix0: ty dork
[7:06:00] jessebona: @sonopulse I wish they'd given DHT a second checkpoint on that subject. It's ridiculous having to walk back from first boss when you're at the end of the dungeon.
[7:06:03] dogjorts: av or ruby in pugs was like 90% chance of deplete lol
[7:06:27] AvalenaTV: bosses in nelt were fun
[7:06:36] Emm_Zee: Magmatusk farming pugs xdd

[7:12:57] Cantwingrr: barely
[7:13:11] Nerafris: totems not taking aoe damage for weeks was pure despair
[7:13:17] jbenson444: I had more problems with the first boss than the last boss in my pugs
[7:13:33] Emm_Zee: Only 1? xdd
[7:13:59] Emm_Zee: There's like 3 s2 dungeons remaining that have that issue xdd
[7:14:09] Hayzed0ut: love uldaman

[7:14:15] sonopulse: snake boss is UNFAIR
[7:14:34] jbenson444: @AvalenaTV as always, dungeons with hallwyas and sanguine are not fun
[7:14:34] nvpal: fuck uldaman and fuck halls
[7:14:36] AvalenaTV: C at best, if you ddint run certain classes it was gg
[7:15:21] IAmSolari: uldaman? no, u da man
[7:15:25] sorenkje: sanguine uldaman
[7:15:27] Nitruos: were there checkpoints to spawn at or was it full runback i dont remember this dungeon

[7:19:58] Emm_Zee: There's only one more dungeon deserving F tier
[7:20:05] Emm_Zee: And we all know which one it is
[7:20:37] MATinMeteCaBRA: Underrot overrated asf tbh, its good but not enough for S tier, 2nd boss is kinda stinky and those spiders that fixate on someone... ugh
[7:20:39] sonopulse: easy dungeon, good design but not high octane gaming required
[7:21:10] Emm_Zee: Second boss area where no mobs are linked so you can fully customize the pull owns
[7:21:41] Kerandes: afflicted in underrot was the most bs thing ever created
[7:21:58] eternalsmile: That's fake^ you were limited by numbers of fixating spiders
[7:22:10] AvalenaTV: u could mc the wormies tho
[7:22:16] AvalenaTV: wasnt that bad
[7:22:27] eternalsmile: And pull whole area?
[7:22:40] IAttackYou: I think fun matters the most
[7:22:41] Emm_Zee: @eternalsmile That was not an issue with ethical prio damage gamers xdd
[7:22:59] eternalsmile: Or constantly kite mobs instead of doing dmg when pugs decide not to stun
[7:23:00] Hayzed0ut: same
[7:23:00] baseboned: bfa dungeons are SO overrated
[7:23:06] Hayzed0ut: no way
[7:23:13] harmless52: dam, fav ever
[7:23:22] AvalenaTV: sharkboss was unironically annoying af, the trash was super fun tho
[7:23:25] baseboned: freehold sucks
[7:23:50] njokkio: 2nd to 3rd boss trash was kinda garbo
[7:24:20] Izkatu: first boss is bad
[7:24:21] sonopulse: I think theyre alright
[7:24:22] IAttackYou: @baseboned how come, do you like shadowlands dungeons?
[7:24:26] eternalsmile: Shouting guys were mostly fake - you could easily outrange them and take 0 dmg but for some reason noone did
[7:24:40] AvalenaTV: yeah 1st boss with certain healers in high tyr was horrible
[7:24:43] Finixx5: hard to say good things about freehold, but it was a banger to run
[7:24:48] AvalenaTV: ppl just get doubletapped and die
[7:25:02] Izkatu: First boss not god comp u die on high tyra
[7:25:11] murl0cqueen: what are he doing?
[7:25:45] Izkatu: All df dungeon tierlist
[7:25:51] harmless52: lol the cannon was way op
[7:26:14] harmless52: i guess you had to run a funny comp to do it tho
[7:27:11] Emm_Zee: Tank take xdd
[7:27:18] sonopulse: will mdi trailer/info be out tomorrow?
[7:27:24] harmless52: uncapped dps love that shit too lol
[7:27:45] Canwestop: i loved getting harpoon'd into an aoe and dying
[7:27:46] Canwestop: xdd
[7:28:10] AvalenaTV: hov and ruby were way better than fh
[7:28:22] Blane86: the trash pack before the last boss would like to have a word with them LUL
[7:28:27] anaya909: if nelth's isn't s tier someone is getting tackled
[7:28:29] AvalenaTV: NL worm tyr before fix KEKW
[7:28:41] AvalenaTV: just get stoned to death
[7:28:41] baseboned: I'd much rather play lair than freehold
[7:28:43] Canwestop: pelters xdd
[7:28:45] sonopulse: as a healer I thought it was cool
[7:28:58] baseboned: @IAttackYou yes I like shadowlands dungeons

[7:30:23] harmless52: f
[7:30:28] harmless52: ez f
[7:30:28] Canwestop: only season to make me not do keys for 4 months
[7:30:34] Emm_Zee: Okay maybe vortex deserves F as well xdd
[7:30:35] AvalenaTV: dragonboss was okay ish
[7:30:35] ninemoreminutes: I like the first 2 bosses
[7:30:39] AvalenaTV: but the rest is garbage
[7:30:43] ninemoreminutes: the rest is dogshit
[7:30:43] lowincomehooker: Pelters were the best in pugs jump one time and not in the pile = don't exist to DPS and they just gun down the party for 30seconds :)
[7:30:50] Emm_Zee: Armored mistral is the worst designed mob in the entite game

[7:31:07] anaya909: pelters were a sick dmg profile.  between externals and any burst cd's, you couldn't plan more than like 3 globals ahead
[7:31:14] anaya909: so you had to play fast and think fast
[7:31:15] baseboned: it was sunny
[7:31:17] Nitruos: u ran so much in here too

[7:37:06] Nitruos: that clip of growl and hte piss elementals, top tier meme
[7:37:09] Thowarr: It's the same as Fall, but with a tight timer and it's straight up ass
[7:37:24] baseboned: fall is my favorite key
[7:37:26] beast2: what a cooked take
[7:37:44] Minigamer911: Boomkin talking GoodTake
[7:37:48] IAmSolari: two healers and a boomie in call GoodTake

[7:38:32] AvalenaTV: 3rd and last boss with melds are fine, without its meh
[7:38:46] Kazoooie: first boss is boring af as well
[7:38:58] sugarshorts: boss three when your dots just fall off when it splits
[7:39:01] harmless52: i kinda like last boss, mind you i don't do 30s but up to 20 it wasn't bad
[7:39:06] xGuiha: 2nd boss room tho
[7:39:09] baseboned: no way is fall worse than nokhud
[7:39:14] IAmSolari: Being able to pull big onto boss
[7:39:16] baseboned: im a healer and its fun as fuck
[7:39:21] AvalenaTV: one of the few keys where u can lust onto boss
[7:39:26] AvalenaTV: thats acutally fun
[7:39:27] sorenkje: fall same rating as uldaman is criminal
[7:39:37] IAmSolari: yeah it has some banger pulls for windwalker
[7:39:57] baseboned: fall is 100 times better than Uldaman
[7:40:31] IAmSolari: B is cool
[7:40:37] Emm_Zee: F
[7:40:38] IAmSolari: rip healer take won

[7:41:18] Galois_rg: they didn't nerf the dragon dmg, and dorki healed it on a 30
[7:41:23] cronic: rise feels way too long for some reason
[7:41:23] Emm_Zee: This dungeon is in the hall of fame of terrible dungeons
[7:41:27] cronic: all the rp and running
[7:41:30] cronic: dogshit
[7:41:36] AvalenaTV: if timer wasnt as hard maybe higher but D for me mainly pugging once u pass 26 and higher
[7:41:45] zolal3: 4 min rp xdd
[7:41:46] Thowarr: RP, running, sand area, gauntlet, dragons... the list goes on
[7:41:53] cronic: and rise has the worst gauntlet of any m+ dungeon ever
[7:41:56] MierkaBlue: @Thowarr ^^ this
[7:42:03] IAmSolari: Does JB like anything different KEKW
[7:42:06] Kazoooie: i agree with jb
[7:42:24] Emm_Zee: One miniboss that has a 50% DR dome, other becomes untargetable, even the best area of this is ass
[7:42:36] baseboned: yes
[7:42:39] harmless52: yea u gotta spread out
[7:42:39] anaya909: jb likes to pull big packs and pop off.  he's a man of the people
[7:42:41] baseboned: its jank
[7:42:57] Thowarr: I do like that I can use my teammates as suicide bombers to go through first so I can get a clean run through
[7:43:02] IAmSolari: if you play with non-shitters the first room is nice
[7:43:24] AvalenaTV: the timer is giiiiga tight tho
[7:43:36] AvalenaTV: unless u have s-tier dps with you on every spot
[7:43:58] IAttackYou: https://clips.twitch.tv/SpookyAssiduousTigerPunchTrees-EADvKxtluEYljwQ5
[7:44:00] AvalenaTV: feels like what fall has too much misses on rise

[7:47:17] baseboned: temple should be F
[7:47:19] harmless52: fall and rise can't be the same tier
[7:47:20] Emm_Zee: I'd even put it behind halls
[7:47:23] MierkaBlue: rise>temple
[7:47:26] Galois_rg: TJS needs to be f tier, I agree with DRATTY
[7:47:29] Emm_Zee: Anything bad in halls is worse in rise
[7:47:30] YakSlacks: rise has a chance at ANY mount in game. how is it not S tier?
[7:47:39] sorenkje: ^ based
[7:47:43] javybavy: temple was janky but rise is just bad
[7:47:46] Finixx5: i'd rather go farm the mount itself
[7:47:47] harmless52: fair point lol
[7:47:57] cronic: @YakSlacks thats not how it works lol

[8:00:43] Kazoooie: temple trees were dogshit as well
[8:00:52] baseboned: max says I can't be annoyed by a bad cameria?
[8:01:01] baseboned: maybe I get to decide what bothers me
[8:01:11] yctnm: by the same logic he should never be annoyed with frontals
[8:01:16] yctnm: more frontals
[8:01:24] raechu_: @yumytv tell Max he doesn't care about camera because he only plays melee. I play both and it's way worse for ranged
[8:02:27] Emm_Zee: Atal should be D tier compared to bfa atal. Never forget what they took from us.

[8:13:49] Nerafris: 2nd boss is a bit absurd

[8:13:56] Emm_Zee: There is 1 mob in everbloom people like (dreadpetal), everything else is ass

[8:13:59] ssj_lenin: just press curse of tongues ez

[8:21:32] Swordish__: she prolly wouldntve quit if sean wasnt such a pussy
[8:21:35] toxictimbo: apparently they broke disc smart atonement application

[8:22:16] baseboned: wut wut wutw
[8:22:17] baseboned: how
[8:22:24] toxictimbo: It's reapplying to targets already with atonement
[8:22:25] ciove57: radiance is overlapping atonements
[8:22:27] Scrila: #nonverbal
[8:22:30] ciove57: if im not mistaken
[8:22:32] bigolmilkymoos: did you know that demon hunters can double jump over the wall before time-lost battlefield
[8:22:33] toxictimbo: so the smart heal application is bricked up
[8:22:44] baseboned: jfc
[8:22:55] toxictimbo: (went on hunter/dk twice)
[8:22:58] RamblingJosh_: so it's not even like it's being recast on the same target
[8:23:11] zolal3: @toxictimbo Despairge
[8:23:12] IAttackYou: wat happened
[8:23:12] ronnir51: MONKA
[8:23:16] toxictimbo: not good
[8:23:24] yctnm: Despairge ?
[8:23:26] RamblingJosh_: welp,time to gamba
[8:23:26] sugarshorts: guess it is the prodigy angle afterall
[8:23:32] toxictimbo: hows your holy set
[8:23:33] MicHawkh: Druid angle?
[8:23:37] IAttackYou: MONKA
[8:23:38] toxictimbo: Despairge
[8:23:38] ciove57: its fine, just play holy and spam zzzzzzz
[8:23:51] unbelieversc2: Hey chat. Guild explode yet?
[8:24:09] baseboned: how do you fuck that up?
[8:24:34] RamblingJosh_: is it just radiance, or other smart heals too?
[8:24:43] MierkaBlue: uuuh, if that is an actual bug you might not be able to do this, since you need one more healer to replace the highgest hp healer as well and man if disc is broken...that shit is bad
[8:24:53] Milano___: Can someone link what he's talking about?
[8:24:53] toxictimbo: not sure but disc without smart heal on radiance is like a dead spec
[8:24:54] ninemoreminutes: people in the priest disc saying it's fine for them and it wasn't earlier so maybu they fixed it
[8:25:07] toxictimbo: @Milano___ when you cast radiance it will hit targets that dont have atonement on it
[8:25:10] beast2: not a good sign
[8:25:11] sarefx: @yumytv did mistweaver have a good reason to leave guild?
[8:25:16] toxictimbo: or it will prioritize if they are in range
[8:25:23] MicHawkh: /gquit angle?
[8:25:29] Arafxd: tfw it's 5 mins after raid start and you're still missing 3 players
[8:25:34] toxictimbo: but the adventure stuff today added i guess broke it so now its being reapplied to the same targets
[8:25:43] TemptedRaven: define broke
[8:25:43] jessebona: @sarefx I could be wrong but I swear I read he just went to another mythic guild. No big mystery.
[8:25:47] toxictimbo: unplayable
[8:25:49] toxictimbo: broken
[8:26:04] yellowtaxicar: Raidyyy
[8:26:14] toxictimbo: in a key LOL
[8:26:15] sarefx: @jessebona i was hoping for some drama

[8:26:41] yellowtaxicar: We believe! You got this today
[8:26:43] Neotahl: Item restore time?
[8:26:46] RamblingJosh_: 2x radiance, 6-10 atonements at random
[8:26:55] Togwen: gl tonight
[8:27:00] Togwen: sugarplum
[8:27:20] epilepticunicorn_: ez kill tonight surely
[8:27:22] virenyxd: worse, you put out single atonements before that @ramblingjosh_
[8:27:59] Neotahl: No RP walk today?
[8:28:02] RamblingJosh_: oh, so even 1 radiance could 5x one person? HOLY
[8:28:11] virenyxd: nono
[8:28:12] MicHawkh: Radiance will only aply to whoever has Attonoment already.
[8:28:36] virenyxd: but a traditional disc ramp will be many single atonements into double radiance
[8:28:49] virenyxd: so the radiance can already overlap the single atonements
[8:28:50] RamblingJosh_: oh sure, bless
[8:28:52] Muchasz: raid look full

[8:31:28] roguerhino: dam
[8:31:45] ninemoreminutes: does your radiance work?
[8:31:48] CarbonWard1: no more than a sub could, and he eats a PI that could be going into BM
[8:31:55] unbelieversc2: wait, no serene?  Who will complain about toxicity?

[9:50:21] jessebona: @IAmSolari The 5+ people trying to each say their piece in the most intense part of the fight was the one that got me. I wonder if they have priority speaker for that sort of thing.

[9:51:34] colombianpotato7: @Pubscrub 400+
[9:51:37] CarbonWard1: @jessebona The problem was that people are messing up their seeds, which pretty much will screw up any comp as you would have to call for replacement or transfer
[9:51:40] samdalle69: best try %?
[9:51:44] IAmSolari: @abelknow every single cd in this fight is assigned and timed
[9:51:52] ottomr1990: growl is payphone guy. just vibing while everyone panics

[9:52:50] baseboned: now Im definitely not playing sod
[9:53:07] epilepticunicorn_: Sadge
[9:53:19] IAmSolari: @epilepticunicorn_ could be true, but you can at least listen and react to one person yelling, 5 people yelling becomes inaudible noise that nobody can follow
[9:53:32] baseboned: if I played, Kaed would find a way to be level 41
[9:53:57] Outsane: was serene a mercenary?
[9:53:58] XiphTV: HUHH
[9:54:03] erasedpaulski: Do you think bringing a dps DK here is worth it simply to make things in p2 infinitely easier? they barely are brought but i feel like p2 prog will be awfull enough and might be worth the slot?
[9:54:06] lapissuu: pull 420 should be the kill COPIUM
[9:54:13] meatseekor: This dying tonight or nah?
[9:54:15] baseboned: that's 1, 6 more
