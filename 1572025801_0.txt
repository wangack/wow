[2:49:14] stew_pp: @stew_pp sick tysm
[2:49:31] Xailen: DH looking good, but so many NYI on them. oof
[2:49:49] StreamElements: Use code POGTOWEL120 for $120 off at https://strms.net/TowellieeFactorMarBot #ad
[2:49:53] DeanoTV: @Xailen ikr and they couldnt even bring out vengeance LUL
[2:49:53] Scoodles91: there is an interview today?
[2:49:57] wEiRdO_dUdE: Yeah, people expect him to ask questions pertinent to the race to world first
[2:50:14] maxkule: @Scoodles91 Max has one with Ion at 5PM EST.
[2:50:34] JohnAlterat: oh my God, they did it!.. It was so much pain that they removed it sustain heal in BFA and SL. @Towelliee For now it isn't overpowered. Don't forgot that it isn't even mythic dungeons. Boss didn't make burst casts, there was not many dmg. So Brewmaster isn't the same as protpally. He just become more like guardian in self-healing
[2:50:40] chulklol: do u need a healer ?
[2:50:49] Avalan09: Max said he wasn't doing anything with Soar or RWF - a lot of season 4 questions about what the future looks like for further xpacs
[2:50:57] xaezoria: will we get dracthyr in pre patch?
[2:51:07] JohnAlterat: @xaezoria yep
[2:51:10] Scoodles91: probebly
[2:51:10] GamingDad77: @xaezoria yes
[2:51:14] thebakeriscomingforu: oh interesting another titan dungeon
[2:51:16] wEiRdO_dUdE: The drawback to having awesome hjuge dungeons
[2:51:17] Thoreya: should never waste a question about a friggin racial spell lol
[2:51:18] xaezoria: okayy great :D
[2:51:27] CmdKookie: dungeon looks good though
[2:51:40] startlord92: ✅ #FreeTopG ✅
[2:51:54] Kylatex: beautifull dungeon, nice map
[2:52:14] NiteshadezTV: this dungeon looks like a WoW version of the ones from New World lmao
[2:52:17] flebbooo: Gives me Throne of thunder/Halls of lightning vibe
[2:52:23] xaezoria: ^^
[2:52:29] thebakeriscomingforu: reminds me of a mix of Ulduar and the pandaria titan structures
[2:52:37] GamingDad77: that's not what she said
[2:52:39] captiv8: That’s what she said
[2:52:41] xSoldierhardx: this couldve been another mega dungeon
[2:52:52] fewyn: titan dungeons should feel huge
[2:53:15] propwash80: @Towelliee what are the early impressions of the DH in the alpha so far?
[2:53:28] Shredx: who cares about shadowlance!?!?!!?!
[2:53:30] Shredx: ugh
[2:53:40] Fugazi811: S4 LUL
[2:53:52] xSoldierhardx: im hoping next week we get more info on release IM SICK OF WAITING
[2:53:53] justagamingfiend: @Towelliee did you write down all your questions on paper again...
[2:53:58] thebakeriscomingforu: yeah, waste of questions there. should have been DF stuff
[2:53:59] xSoldierhardx: i need to schedule time off
[2:54:01] Thoreya: @Shredx i mean s4 is a huge hit so i can understand why he wants to see how ion feels about it in the future
[2:54:02] Merkuriuz: lol
[2:54:08] Frostfury: Leggos to 304? Kappa
[2:54:08] Scoodles91: who cares abot shadowlands anymore
[2:54:13] Thoreya: and if they change anything about it
[2:54:14] WhoIsAndrewJ: you can ask SL questions and get real feed back - or ask DF Questions and get wishy washy answers - tough call on what to ask
[2:54:15] mavericks312: asking about shadowlands is a time waster and waste of a question
[2:54:19] cappei: He should ask Ion when the Power Word: Update 2.0 arrives OMEGALUL
[2:54:26] xSoldierhardx: ive saved 4 of my 5 floating holidays for release
[2:54:29] the_general01: bold of us to assume Max watched anyone else's interviews
[2:54:44] XiMoee: when will be shadowlands be over?
[2:54:46] mavericks312: @the_general01 oh he for sure did
[2:55:04] chulklol: OMG  are we gonna save turtles again !! ??
[2:55:07] warbringer159: @Towelliee havent seen u playing much of wotlk beta are u going to be playing it at all?
[2:55:08] Gillettefuzionz: @the_general01 of course he has??
[2:55:24] barlan_za: !beta
[2:55:24] Moobot: @barlanza About couple weeks of Alpha left. Beta is Soon™ and we will probably (99.97%) have keys and giveaways for the Hammer Squad to have access to it. Follow twitter.com/towelthetank for updates as well as the !discord
[2:55:29] the_general01: @mavericks312 he might have. but he took in 0 information, because hes asking the same questions in some cases
[2:55:34] Zzorski: @Towelliee this looks like a revamped version of that pandaria raid with the water guy in the middle hes the first boss of that raid SoO?
[2:55:42] valarbravoosi: wait what?
[2:55:46] valarbravoosi: brew has RSK?
[2:55:48] captiv8: Let’s see this
[2:55:54] Kneckt: me :)
[2:55:55] GamingDad77: you
[2:55:55] Scrubooze: Wordup yeehaw
[2:55:56] Thoreya: its only a 30 min interview too sadge
[2:55:58] flebbooo: u
[2:55:58] vic_ave: havoc
[2:55:59] Armdel: you because you solo'd the boss
[2:56:00] Fugazi811: you
[2:56:00] captiv8: Havocs
[2:56:00] chulklol: dh
[2:56:01] cappei: Enhance
[2:56:04] Vitalsigns64: enhance
[2:56:05] Arendiel_: you
[2:56:05] PlagueHit: shaman
[2:56:08] Maldor313: monk tank XD
[2:56:09] JohnAlterat: @Towelliee features of DF are huge but not hyped such as "wow" artifacts, torghast e.t.c. Their meaning just "underground" and most players just don't realize how much it will change their gameplay. Same shit was on Cataclysm when we saw by ourselves  the new talent system
[2:56:12] Havoc_S1: Me
[2:56:12] Scrubooze: Lets go wordup
[2:56:14] Thoreya: enh tree is so nutty
[2:56:24] TruVillainManny: There was some talk of smaller patches more frequently. I would want to know if they can elaborate on the delivery plan.
[2:56:28] TwitchTronikk: Is there a profile for Enhanced Raid Frames?
[2:56:35] dimofodi: the enh has also had more time with trees to flesh out a build, give havoc a little bit more time
[2:56:54] uwandre: When is the new wow coming out?
[2:56:59] JokaThS: will you play havoc ? @Towelliee
[2:57:29] Zzorski: what is the anniversary event?
[2:57:45] Lostdogal: lets see where this all falls once they start balancing before I start leveling anything new.
[2:58:01] the_general01: @Zzorski its where we get a bit of an exp boost
[2:59:04] asmodaus923: thats 8% with having statue pumpin
[2:59:33] flebbooo: nooo
[2:59:37] ZuggSpeedman: damage just needs to get tuned
[2:59:39] flebbooo: serpent is trash
[2:59:42] Shaduoken: I would not
[2:59:42] macromellion: afaik mw doesn't even take their statue now
[2:59:43] mikeyyyy_m: no i wouldnt
[2:59:46] Loudriot: in mythic+ deinitely white tiger
[3:00:03] thebakeriscomingforu: Some class talent trees just seem like they need a numbers tuning but are otherwise fine.
[3:00:04] Thoreya: monk fiestaaaaa
[3:00:06] Mecabeast: if it works with windwalker mastery and doesn't mess with chi generation maybe
[3:00:30] GamingDad77: do it
[3:00:37] Rexialiton: That sounds fun
[3:00:47] derry10: Jade Statue needs to be reworked because MW shouldn't be casting Soothing Mist a whole lot

[3:05:09] the_general01: lol
[3:05:29] HaxzorJimDuggan: corsair is making a bendable gaming monitor, im sure its gonna cost a fortune LUL

[3:05:54] HaxzorJimDuggan: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_SPs3pXsLk
[3:06:00] HaxzorJimDuggan: video of it
[3:06:10] MaleFrom73: teleporting you to a node surrounded by a pack of mobs :P
[3:06:23] victoryhowl: schalech subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 2 months, currently on a 1 month streak! Hey all o/
[3:06:27] Alepouditsa: i still have a monitor that is over 12 years old danKEK
[3:06:28] cabalish: go asus
[3:06:28] Templexx: curved ones are silly imo
[3:06:29] Brodih_: your a simple bitch
[3:06:30] SonofHorus82: Towelliee still rocking those 1998 Compaq box monitors.
[3:06:31] wEiRdO_dUdE: 60Hz used to be really good....but 120Hz or 144Hz is just so much smoother
[3:06:32] Denohar: my standard for monitors is way lower than for headphones
[3:06:49] xSoldierhardx: i loved my 24" monitors and now that i got 3 27" 1440p monitors they seeem like too much
[3:06:52] ArcaneSyntax: I have a curved monitor and it doesn't even feel different, I have no idea why people want curved.
[3:07:07] abracka_: AYYO
[3:07:08] KaisenSiru: KEKW
[3:07:16] kimmo_gaming: @Towelliee Its not just you, its a monitor, it has its purpose, it doesnt have to be round or curved, or flexed, or whatever
[3:07:19] abracka_: i feel like squidward right now, "future! future!"
[3:07:19] Morpserie: that's so stupid KEKW
[3:07:27] wEiRdO_dUdE: The curved ones are slightly better at letting you see the whole screen at the same time with your eyes
[3:07:28] cigarette_butter: probably just a meme product for press
[3:07:28] Kneckt: lol gimmicks
[3:07:32] mozavich: towelliee nope, i am a boomer and love simplicity. don't need "gaming monitors". just give me a regular old lcd 27 inch.
[3:07:36] cappei: Yeah, but what if I want to adjust my curve that totally changes my gameplay experience Kappa
[3:07:37] Alienfromger: why? because they can LUL
[3:07:45] the_general01: imma make an s shape outta mine
[3:07:52] kimmo_gaming: I like curved women, not monitors LOL
[3:07:56] Xailen: curved was odd, now they want custom curves. i cant even, dumb asf
[3:07:56] jasonbriggs: i feel like curved this week lol
[3:07:57] Alepouditsa: more like the know we reach the and of ungrades so try to make new things
[3:07:59] Fawcheddar: its for people who cant make up their mind lol
[3:08:00] ThrasiusGG: what a waste of money LUL
[3:08:04] Youredoneson666: Curved = immersion, flat = fps / competitive
[3:08:06] dimofodi: some games probably look better on flat or curved and vice versa, gives the consumer flexibility
[3:08:06] spookychefkarolina: I don’t see the appeal
[3:08:07] GamingDad77: @kimmo_gaming AMEN
[3:08:07] Alepouditsa: end*
[3:08:10] SonofHorus82: I wanna curve one side but keep the other side straight...
[3:08:20] HaxzorJimDuggan: you put it back straight when people come over so they dont think you are an idiot for buying a curved monitor Kappa
[3:08:31] wEiRdO_dUdE: With human vision, you have to move your eyes a bit with larger monitors to really see it all the best, the curved thing makes sense when you think about eyes being curved
[3:08:31] SonofHorus82: or just curve it into a full circle and put my head in there for max immersion.
[3:08:41] spookychefkarolina: LUL LUL
[3:08:44] Naturalbeef: Soon you'll be able to fold your monitor up and stick it in your pocket
[3:08:56] Templexx: min maxing eyes
[3:09:00] the_general01: @Naturalbeef we call those phones
[3:09:05] HaxzorJimDuggan: 45 inch for a pc monitor is too much imo
[3:09:09] Lostdogal: waiting for the curved monitor with built in toaster
[3:09:10] dimofodi: @Naturalbeef you mean soon youll be able to use your phone as a monitor? :)
[3:09:11] warbringer159: @Towelliee are u going to be playing wotlk beta? havent seen u on it much :)
[3:09:12] notColt45: There is a foldable monitor on Kickstarter
[3:09:16] wEiRdO_dUdE: My monitors are flat and I'm fine, too, but the curved stuff is slightly nicer
[3:09:16] HaxzorJimDuggan: 32 at most imo
[3:09:18] Varkarus: the DH looks great! sorry, just joined stream!
[3:09:20] OhNoNotAgain: We will 100% judge you
[3:09:21] Djfarmville: eye beam brrr

[3:11:03] Youredoneson666: I really hope they fix the liftoff thing and not leaving it the way it is
[3:11:12] Molvonos: Betatesting WotLK is like going back to the amusement park and riding the old wooden roller coaster you rode as a kid.  Not nearly as exciting as you remember it.

[3:18:22] MrFuzzynuts420: why can't both spec come out at the same time?
[3:18:24] wEiRdO_dUdE: The sigils really do make DH feel different to play

[3:22:49] RAF_Sean: Silencve for m+
[3:22:50] Hu33ard: silence sigil for m+
[3:22:53] zenkodac: depends both fit
[3:22:59] Duce25: For m+ you go for silence and fear
[3:23:03] KaisenSiru: Depends on your style of play
[3:23:03] wEiRdO_dUdE: Yeah that silence is nice
[3:23:13] Strifelol: Silence prob pretty nice for M+
[3:23:37] TAYLOR_HAM: Vengeance gets bluuurrr Kreygasm
[3:23:43] Thoreya: havoc getting silence is gonna be so busted in pvp
[3:23:53] hiddjes: vengeance with blur damn
[3:24:20] zenkodac: for havoc all the sigils come after you grab all the output, which should leave you with like 4 or 5 points for extra stuff
[3:24:21] iLAMARIO: thats only for while they are feared, so its not that good
[3:24:26] zenkodac: thats gona be insane for veng
[3:24:33] zenkodac: darkness and blur
[3:24:36] Xailen: They have rock walls you need mining to open up, nothing inside though...
[3:24:39] Firepowatv: silence sigil is a 2 min cd though
[3:24:47] thebakeriscomingforu: like none
[3:24:47] Kinghorn: 0
[3:24:58] reggiepowa: wait, people play pvp?
[3:24:59] Angsterz: O7
[3:25:00] Strifelol: Blur doesn't give you 20% damage reduction anymore.
[3:25:00] ayrisen: goose egg worth
[3:25:04] zenkodac: yup
[3:25:05] Strifelol: It's just 50% dodge
[3:25:08] zenkodac: big stonks
[3:25:09] notColt45: Just bajeera's thing i think
[3:25:11] warrenny: Wow has pvp?
[3:25:17] Gillettefuzionz: It's hard to do pvp feedback when pvp instancing isn't available for testing yet (arenas, bg's etc)
[3:25:24] Gillettefuzionz: Just dueling mostly
[3:25:27] Firepowatv: good
[3:25:29] iLAMARIO: best thing about sigils is you get Quickened Sigils and Elysian Decree in the spec tree taht makes it 40s CD
[3:25:33] SpoofAvatar: might slow the pace down a littlew
[3:25:36] dimofodi: PvPers always give feedback, they never shut up...Blizz just never listens to them :D
[3:25:37] TAYLOR_HAM: Blur still gives 20% dmg reduction it was confirmed by the dev
[3:25:54] Fawcheddar: if everyone is OP, no one is trash
[3:25:54] Strifelol: Ahhh okay cool so it's just a tooltip error :D
[3:25:58] vic_ave: @towelliee Then maybe we can stop seeing Rogue Mage Priest
[3:26:06] reggiepowa: isnt it 3 min right now?
[3:26:07] iLAMARIO: thats baseline now, 3m
[3:26:18] zenkodac: i havent seen much of that in the forums
[3:26:30] zenkodac: council peole seem to ba all about pve
[3:26:33] zenkodac: people*
[3:26:33] TwoShotTV: The hunt is amazing
[3:26:34] notColt45: The Hunt is so fun
[3:26:34] NewWorldReign: Just pre ordered Dragonflight, now I wait
[3:26:49] wEiRdO_dUdE: We like damage reduction
[3:26:52] RAF_Sean: Sigil of Flame yeah
[3:26:53] TAYLOR_HAM: No one uses Demon muzzle now dont know why its there
[3:26:53] Mecabeast: the hunt is like high mountain racial I think
[3:26:59] Sollice: Not on Havoc
[3:27:01] TAYLOR_HAM: its a conduit
[3:27:11] nado_king: hunt is opener
[3:27:17] instant_savage: vengence has that i think it was a torghast thing
[3:27:18] razledazle1337: it's a conduit for veng
[3:27:33] iLAMARIO: no shot hunt is the first thing you do
[3:27:40] maidenhaur: the sigil thing gets cancelled after the 1st hit it takes?
[3:27:55] Thoreya: the dh guy was in maxs chat last night. that blur is also gonna have 50% dodge
[3:28:02] Thoreya: just not on the tooltip rn
[3:28:27] Daarksyde: Havoc has so many choices, AND they get sigils
[3:28:33] iLAMARIO: also for Elysian Decree in havoc spec tree
[3:28:38] razledazle1337: @thoreya so glad I play DH lmaooo
[3:28:53] Dankind64: I don't mind it with the whole loadout selection thing
[3:29:04] iLAMARIO: darkness is very mehh in most cases
[3:29:07] Megadisaster24: wow, they made darkness into a 5 min cooldown
[3:29:10] Daarksyde: I missed the dungeon logs, how did the DHs and Enhance Sham do?
[3:29:11] DeanoTV: sigils, the hunt + elysian decree Kreygasm
[3:29:31] JokaThS: darkness
[3:29:33] razledazle1337: @deanotv I loe

[3:30:33] flebbooo: Havoc tree looks like a samuri warrior KEKW
[3:30:34] DeanoTV: @razledazle1337 nah sinful was boring imo
[3:30:45] Sollice: Nah

[3:30:56] Sollice: Well unless its only 1 base line now
[3:30:57] razledazle1337: @deanotv I love sinful, so OPOP

[3:44:29] Daarksyde: sounds like DH AOE will be op AGAIN
[3:44:33] iLAMARIO: you need all immo aura talents with that
[3:44:46] Firepowatv: :o
[3:44:46] nightknightjiujitsu: sadge
[3:44:51] Strifelol: There's going to be a lot of sad DH's that take that talent and the explosion happens when all the mobs are dead KEKW
[3:44:52] TAYLOR_HAM: Vengeance Tank gonna be GOAT tank in DF
[3:44:54] dualram: sounds pretty cool yeh, but it is too far in the tree and doesnt allow to pick more interesting options in the left/bottom
[3:45:02] Manabucho: wait so we can make a melee fel fire mage ?? by spamming immolate and eye beam??
[3:45:13] spookychefkarolina: @xxchaoticjessxx yeah! Exactly. I love it… but then I’m not awake for “business” hours making some of my errands hard to do lol unless I’m willing to sleep less. Which I never am LUL
[3:45:15] GamingDad77: @Manateedk yep
[3:45:17] j_bar111: That was a legendary
[3:45:19] TAYLOR_HAM: Annoying playstyle on Burning Wound IMO, doesnt feel good trying to keep dots on all targets
[3:45:19] f1sh1nad1sh: cycle of hatred is bugged atm where it fully resets eye beam
[3:45:20] maidenhaur: why did wowhead delete an article "s4 bosses scaling with fortified"?
[3:45:22] nightknightjiujitsu: df needs a envoker dragon tank lol be so sic

[3:45:50] mayonaes: damage and healing
[3:45:51] TAYLOR_HAM: Its bad outside PVP imo
[3:45:52] Elff11: yuppers
[3:45:53] Manabucho: @Manateedk jesus christ this sounds nuts, and i was allready hype from warrior but this just tops it xD
[3:45:54] Strifelol: Yep yep
[3:45:55] abracka_: it's not as awful as it was on launch of SL tho
[3:45:59] mayonaes: fodder is more of a pvp talent

[3:46:16] KaisenSiru: YEP Glide
[3:46:19] Teddyruxpins: If you pvp as a dh fodder all the way.

[3:46:29] Thoreya: dhs not gonna know what to do now theres so many buttons
[3:46:29] Strifelol: Glide and Cycle of Hatred are bugged atm haha
[3:46:30] LycanKain: No

[3:46:41] 74n0: jump meta
[3:46:43] Lokdannin: i thought that was a thing in legion beta, might be wrong
[3:46:43] Sicknessqt: LUL that talent
[3:46:51] odriscoll1234: glide is wrong
[3:46:51] dayshftw: feel like blade dace should be added
[3:46:52] razledazle1337: just be gliding the entire boss fight lmao
[3:46:52] Strifelol: Glide is intended on dragonflight
[3:46:54] dimofodi: oh and it stacks so you can glide for like a minute before the boss pull and have like a minute of momentum
[3:46:55] JokaThS: they prob did that because ppl dont like fel rush in the rotation
[3:46:59] KaisenSiru: Glide and get killed more often when a mechanic happens LUL
[3:47:01] nightknightjiujitsu: spam space bar!!! lol
[3:47:06] iLAMARIO: someone said it glide might have a 12s CD to give that buff 🤔
[3:47:07] odriscoll1234: should be felblade instead of glide
[3:47:08] Manabucho: glide to buff immo aura xD
[3:47:09] mayonaes: RIP my spacebar
[3:47:15] I_AdoreGaming: The Creator of the talent tree was in Max's chat last night. its not meant to be glide.
[3:47:18] captiv8: Does it stack?
[3:47:21] Ch0p_Su3y: I forsee many macros for glide/cancel glide instant for getting that buff
[3:47:27] Nalleys: gliding out of every mechanic and anytime I gotta move an inch KEKW
[3:47:27] DanielMorenoMiniatures: Dev already said that is not correct
[3:47:38] Strifelol: "Glide is indeed intended to trigger Momentum’s effect.  That said, the duration of Momentum’s effect is currently stacking like it does on live realms and that’s unintended. It will be changed to be a refresh in a future update."
[3:47:38] Manabucho: what!
[3:47:44] iLAMARIO: this is OP in dungeons tho
[3:47:46] dimofodi: @Towelliee max was nonstop gliding in town yesterday, no CD, and it stacks so you can glide 10x and get 60s of momentum before a pull
[3:47:47] Hortlul: hey just got in, what does the NYI mean?
[3:47:50] iLAMARIO: Any means necessary
[3:47:52] Seerated: "Just gliiiide", Fight Club !
[3:47:55] Manabucho: sorry i just lost
[3:48:02] Megadisaster24: yea
[3:48:02] f1sh1nad1sh: cycle of hatred is bugged atm where it fully resets eye beam
[3:48:17] iisobase: @hortlul not yet implemented
[3:48:19] nightknightjiujitsu: circle of hatred!
[3:48:23] iLAMARIO: in heavy aoe, you probably go all right side
[3:48:31] dayshftw: LOL nice
[3:48:33] Hortlul: @greyardbtw ah okay that makes sense, thank you
[3:48:39] Thoreya: who woulda thougt havoc would be this interesting LUL LUL
[3:48:42] odriscoll1234: glide will be taking out
[3:48:46] Strifelol: Yeah, cycle of hatred fully resets eye beam ONLY when it refunds fury.
[3:48:53] iLAMARIO: thats why its bad
[3:48:56] CYNIC308: the class tree has a talent that lets fel fire dmg heal you as well
[3:48:58] iLAMARIO: you dont go momentum
[3:49:01] dualram: dont go right :)
[3:49:13] JokaThS: go middle path
[3:49:14] mayonaes: Fel bombard?
[3:49:20] raldrik: DH looks like it is going to have very specific builds for different scenarios.
[3:49:30] dualram: middle path is the way :)
[3:49:37] dayshftw: i got to momentum and shattered Destiny

[3:50:09] TAYLOR_HAM: DH BABYYYY
[3:50:09] 74n0: stacks duration not effect
[3:50:10] Strifelol: That's not intended
[3:50:12] Daarksyde: lol bug
[3:50:12] Dankind64: LUL that HAS to be a bug

[3:50:20] Merkuriuz: its only supose to refresh
[3:50:20] vic_ave: no it's broken
[3:50:23] m4gnify: press X to doubt
[3:50:23] Strifelol: "Glide is indeed intended to trigger Momentum’s effect.  That said, the duration of Momentum’s effect is currently stacking like it does on live realms and that’s unintended. It will be changed to be a refresh in a future update."
[3:50:24] TheGcsmith: that's how it currently works on live without the glide benefit
[3:50:24] Thoreya: im dead
[3:50:24] razledazle1337: WHAAAATTTTT
[3:50:27] dimofodi: YUP
[3:50:27] poohbear8: 10 minute pull timer so the dh can stack momentum
[3:50:28] Stampsha: so every DH before a boss pull needs 5 mins to chage it up for a full boss fight xD
[3:50:29] mayonaes: f

[3:50:37] dimofodi: no clue but you can stack at least 60s

[4:30:42] PvtHudson093: it like asking for a 3rd DH spec, it aint happening
[4:30:43] CapDan: dad says no. why argue
[4:30:46] nightknightjiujitsu: mid expac maybe hopefully
[4:31:03] banjlolz: @CapDan imagine bragging about your broken dmg in an alpha stage game LUL
[4:31:06] Kneckt: @Towelliee are tier sets in the collections yet
[4:31:12] CYNIC308: @Quojin yea thats a great argument

[4:32:08] mashiesmashie: yeah saw the stream pop up as i was going sleep
[4:32:16] Quojin: @CYNIC308 like he said he asked, they said not yet. hes being an adult about it
[4:32:19] CYNIC308: it was entertaining
[4:32:42] CapDan: lookit all the leech!
[4:33:50] CapDan: btw Elysian decree seems to SLAP (and so does GLaive Tempest) having watched a dungeon run comparing GT and Fel Barrage)
[4:33:57] Strifelol: lmao
[4:34:03] Strifelol: You can double jump while eye beaming

[4:36:28] PvtHudson093: raid comes first
[4:36:35] Strifelol: Nah being in meta this long is not intended and only is possible because we can spam eye beam and it's not capping
[4:36:43] CapDan: yo Vers no longer top prio on stats alone makes this patch good @Towelliee
[4:37:02] kone_malone: thoughts on new capital?!
[4:37:10] CapDan: @Strifelol the capstone makes it feel like they do want people in meta for longer though. you can spend a LOT of fury in that time.
[4:37:20] ZetYokai: fair
[4:37:24] Jabbiz: Tier sets in appearences in game?

[4:38:38] nightknightjiujitsu: lol facts
[4:38:40] JokaThS: if it was about exposure they would do it with small streamers @Towelliee
[4:38:44] N3llee: man of the people
[4:38:53] notColt45: That's the classic technique to underpay people their actual value. Companies have been doing that for years with interns etc

[4:39:35] the_bad_goat: Exposure don’t pay the electricity bill
[4:39:38] N3llee: there will be some humbling
[4:39:40] Zivs: Well they were still streaming during the Show, seemed more like a short n fun event
[4:39:42] nightknightjiujitsu: when do they offically take control?
[4:39:48] HaloS23: @Towelliee at this point they need exposure from you vs vice versa

[4:54:44] CapDan: meanwhile glaive should go before eyebeam because of one of the talents @Towelliee
[4:54:56] BrokenLUL: you should just run less dps
[4:55:19] BrokenLUL: 1 less player
[4:55:21] Zolshy89: you used to eye beam then Mets to instantly get ere beam back
[4:55:22] CapDan: 2 mins?
[4:55:33] llNoTToXiCll: @Towelliee  can you make a fel rush macro that only rushes to that one target ?
[4:55:37] LCS01: @Towelliee so u dont like evoker healer?
[4:55:53] Joefoshow15: how are the DH tress looking?
[4:55:54] GamingDad77: @LCS01 he just doesn't play healer classes
[4:55:59] CapDan: i mean it's utility you never had before @Towelliee
[4:56:06] Gillrad: @NoTToXiCLuL no, fel rush doesn't work that way
[4:56:13] llNoTToXiCll: healers can be fun
[4:56:13] CapDan: not like you lost disrupt
[4:56:32] Kittastrophe: look some people tank, some people heal, some people like pure dps

[4:56:47] CapDan: 32k leech
[4:56:49] CapDan: amazing
[4:56:52] LCS01: @GamingDad77 i mean, i saw he saying his former paladin healer partner in dg was healing better than evoker
[4:56:53] terraqt9: is ur vapee with nicotine? @towelliee
[4:56:56] llNoTToXiCll: @Gillrad  i know fel rush doesnt work that way which is why i asked if a macro can be used to make it simulate that
[4:57:08] CommanderKrano: one of the major things im happy about in DF. be able to just switch the specc, not needing some legendaries and stuff. it will be great Kreygasm
[4:57:08] thebakeriscomingforu: i think the distance evoker has for their abilities and how long to cast is the barrier with them
[4:57:22] Gillrad: @NoTToXiCLuL it doesn't work in a way that would allow a macro to work like that
[4:57:44] llNoTToXiCll: @Gillrad  thank you for reqording
[4:57:50] GamingDad77: @LCS01 yeah. but he himself doesn't play them at all. just not a spec he is interested in playing

[5:09:13] HighThereBud: @NieIas Wrath
[5:09:14] dimofodi: Blizzard is on a 15 year program to phase feral out. First, separate from Guardian. Next ignore them for 15 years until no one plays them anymore. Delete them, Druid still has 3 specs, no one is the wiser.
[5:09:15] iRumm: Ronald and Harold by movie 3

[5:11:53] JokaThS: blade dance in meta
[5:11:54] LeDerpski: Bladedance inside meta
[5:11:58] Jango_: @Drekorve I have played feral my entire time in wow and have seen the lows and highs.  It feels extremely ignored and has felt that way for 5 years
[5:12:20] GamingDad77: looks good tbh
[5:12:27] Drekorve: @Jango_ Yup agreed and same. Have played feral since the end of BC when I started.
[5:12:34] Jango_: keeping savage roar up is not compelling gameplay
[5:12:54] monikossa: @Towelliee "Dynamically switches targets based on where you’re looking."
[5:12:57] densoga8: 19?
[5:12:59] Strifelol: Eye beam is good damage
[5:13:21] wisplingz: Does glide gives momentum in live as well or is it just on DF?
[5:13:22] monikossa: no
[5:13:24] Archiee: for the most part yeah
[5:13:28] Archiee: it's a little buggy
[5:13:36] LeDerpski: yeah

[5:13:40] dayshftw: yuo

[5:13:44] cptrogers123: Did you know a level 60 boost cost more than the base edition of dragonflight? LUL

[5:16:13] myfans4141: that 10% is not good
[5:16:17] Strifelol: Yeah I did, I went full ST but I only used eye beam to get fury
[5:16:33] rymerre: broken how?
[5:16:44] Strifelol: Eye beam was only for fury and keeping up meta buff

[5:17:51] EndoRushx: No just wiggle around after you luse it
[5:17:53] yaashs: DH talent tree seems pretty good actually
[5:18:00] EndoRushx: No need to target enemy in the back
[5:18:15] rymerre: yeah

[5:18:18] Strifelol: They need to fix some bugs and move some talents around the tree to make it make more sense, this tree is going to feel amazing.
[5:18:21] rymerre: thats how it works on live
[5:18:30] rymerre: its an aoe
[5:18:31] catalyticflow: Is there still a 5 cap?
[5:18:35] meiyuwu: yeah, you just have to walk around a lil bit to spread the DoTT
[5:18:40] m4gnify: depends on what the aoe range is
[5:18:41] Peqdevil: when you travel is when it can miss
[5:18:41] GamingDad77: @catalyticflow yes
[5:18:42] Hu33ard: yeah so long as you're kinda close it hits everything
[5:19:08] PlagueHit: Venthyr one was better in raids for single I guess
[5:19:08] catalyticflow: “ should” pathing is kinda weak sometimes
[5:19:14] meiyuwu: you've got a small time frame to walk around to spread the DoT to other targets
[5:19:22] Strifelol: @Towelliee This iteration of DH with this tree feels more like Legion DH when we were actually good lol
[5:19:24] Peqdevil: Sinful Brand
[5:19:25] wEiRdO_dUdE: sinful brand
[5:19:25] LycanKain: The venthyr did good damage, but wasn't fun
[5:19:25] WhoIsAndrewJ: boring brand
[5:19:26] LeDerpski: Because its boring lol
[5:19:28] spicykekw: cuz it had awful gameplay...
[5:19:28] Elementlolz1: we dont like that
[5:19:29] swervity82: playstyle sucks
[5:19:30] xziyn: Venthyr ability is horrible
[5:19:30] Elementlolz1: :D
[5:19:30] dualram: because it was shiiiiiit
[5:19:31] DunzoCD: everyone hates it
[5:19:31] EndoRushx: "Liked"
[5:19:36] Todmeister9000: thank god
[5:19:37] Mecabeast: sinful brand dot is way to strong
[5:19:40] Peqdevil: you could actually keep Dot on forever
[5:19:42] sylvosis: No one liked it
[5:19:44] JokaThS: it was strong but no one liked it
[5:19:46] catalyticflow: It’s only good with second leggo
[5:20:00] PlagueHit: It was good for single target
[5:20:21] Velashen: That is a little weird for sure.
[5:20:25] catalyticflow: If demonic origins wasn’t a pvp talent it’d be lit
[5:20:26] giggz91: Hit a back one now
[5:20:32] giggz91: Form a far
[5:20:35] Todmeister9000: it's only strong becasue of 4-set and double leggo
[5:20:39] fluh_: make fel barrage great again
[5:20:49] Zigg3man: Havoc DH balance or meh or OP so far?
[5:21:02] thatM0NEYguy: Bro, the option to machine gun spells now with a keybind  Kreygasm
[5:21:03] sylvosis: @towelliee no one liked sinful brand
[5:21:05] fluh_: just like the animation of it tbh
[5:21:36] NieIas: Is endgame engaging? I saw preach play it today and he was very disappointed by all the fill the bar quests
[5:21:39] Velashen: They should just change it to the destination with a small aoe. Weird ability.
[5:21:47] GamingDad77: @Zigg3man IMO...balanced as long as you don't choose current broken abilities
[5:21:55] gritbarontv: looks like splash damage
[5:22:11] catalyticflow: It should just splash on impact, but blizzard likes to make things annoying

[5:22:20] spicykekw: @NieIas its WoW afterall. endgame is gonna be pvp, m+ and raid as always :/ not much to do in open world
[5:22:23] Strifelol: This class is going to be amazing man I'm loving this already
[5:22:35] Zigg3man: @GamingDad77  ofc. it's alpha so some stuff are broken, like that prot warr spamming ability LUL
[5:22:40] Jango_: he cant help himself
[5:22:52] GamingDad77: @Zigg3man which is fixed now
[5:22:53] catalyticflow: We also want character customization then.
[5:23:04] m4gnify: @catalyticflow striking pass through targets fits the spaz gameplay tho
[5:23:13] catalyticflow: And soar
[5:23:15] Zigg3man: @GamingDad77 good to know, I haven't seen much yet of Havoc nor Vengenge DH :) ok, prot warr fixed, nice
[5:23:20] Peqdevil: it was that way in Live as well
[5:23:24] gritbarontv: the is a pretty close cluster, so it will it them.

[5:24:20] catalyticflow: Metamorphosis soar
[5:24:20] CapDan: @Towelliee did you look at the sigil of flame damage? I dont think it's high enough to justify taking it as Havoc.
[5:24:39] wisplingz: vengeance talent tree in wowhead is just a placeholder or it's live in DF alpha?
[5:24:47] PojaLive: He said he's only asking in relation to season 4 stuff carrying over to DF
[5:24:50] GamingDad77: @wisplingz PH
[5:24:53] Faolahn: He's more asking about lessons learned from S4 and whether anything can be taken into future seasons
[5:24:54] Drekorve: @Jango_ No problem!
[5:24:56] wisplingz: ty
[5:25:14] WhoIsAndrewJ: show talents?
[5:25:21] Meclya: You can move around (~1sec) after the hunt to spread the dot also, at least on live.
[5:25:29] EKS90_: read people complaining about momentum "still being there" just don't play it
[5:25:33] Overhaul_1229: is glaive tempest the ability from the artifact weaps back in legion?
[5:25:41] CapDan: yup. thats what I see too.
[5:25:56] CapDan: @vishionnn yessir!~
[5:26:25] quisto123: I feel like that's always true, even as vengeance, you want blur, and chaos nova

[5:28:16] NieIas: Bring back towderp
[5:28:25] kone_malone: I cant believe they made Darkness a 5 min CD and then another talent to make it what it currently is in live. I think that is the only lazy thing  about class side
[5:28:30] mavericks312: dragons make everything better
[5:28:31] GamingDad77: @CapDan best true statement
[5:28:31] CapDan: @Commander_Eggi fair enough. Hopefully the tree and balance allows for that.
[5:28:40] Treehop: Welcome

[5:29:15] GamingDad77: name shmork
[5:29:25] EKS90_: @CapDan I don't think you will need to cram out every single output node from the tree unless you are planning to push keys to over 15 or mythic raid, and I do neither. so Im good.
[5:29:50] CapDan: @Commander_Eggi totally fair. I am nowhere near "mythic" so I feel that for sure

[5:30:39] Velashen: If they can bring a caster style build in unholy that would be cool. They have only dabbled with it.
[5:30:39] Megoff: Wait what happened, why didnt look into unholy?
[5:31:08] wEiRdO_dUdE: That is a big question, how often are weapons going to be WQ rewards....that once a week thing was awful

[5:48:21] Intrus18: Anything new thats good? aside from Havoc.
[5:48:27] Ertra: have you tried the new auto targeting system Towelliee?
[5:48:30] procyon_mfc: I imagine those will be removed at pre-patch or have the text changed to only works up to 60\
[5:49:18] f1sh1nad1sh: in patch notes there is a new targeting system that you have to manually enable via a command

[5:49:55] skittlesman09: can u use regular flying mounts or does it have to be dragon riding in the new zones
[5:50:09] GamingDad77: @skittlesman09 only dragon riding
[5:50:16] PanoramicPanda: It's supposed to target without hitting tab more or less
[5:50:18] skittlesman09: ok

[5:55:57] Overhaul_1229: its sad the state of crafting has been so poor for so long
[5:56:11] jabsyea: new accessibility option, you interact with the closest interactable. I think you have to enable it with a script on alpha right now
[5:57:01] Overhaul_1229: 100% the new systems have me pretty excited

[6:11:08] ladibor: jesus DR looks painfull if u want to farm herbs and mining
[6:11:16] Bourrel: @PapaBeks they said eventually
[6:11:19] Xailen: Our old flight mounts could unlock Dragonriding skills in 10.1, and then old flight in 10.2

[6:11:35] grumpnamedjosh: Did you already talk about the new enchants on wowhead
[6:11:52] Jeanssi: have to log in to check, pretty sure you flew above it but there wasn't any nodes
[6:12:04] Funderik: there's defo room to expand with professions as the expansion goes forward, they would even do profession type dungeons, where it's no combat, you have to mining, fish and herb/make potions to survive a cave that's falling apart.

[6:23:17] valianya: @towelliee  why aren't you tracking resource nodes?
[6:23:23] llNoTToXiCll: that needs something done with haha
[6:23:31] abracka_: @Towelliee does dragonriding feel smoother today after the updates compared to yesterday?
[6:23:44] valianya: Did they remove node tracking?
[6:23:50] Funderik: bravo to blizzard for making something as boring and simple as mining, interesting and different.
[6:24:10] GamingDad77: @Funderik with lore

[6:25:17] Xailen: the new crafting reminds me of FF14
[6:25:28] Funderik: new world professions were amazing, i hope blizzard steal ideas.
[6:25:36] Neziko: I still play New World now and then, and it's fun to play still.
[6:25:37] procyon_mfc: They have Amazon behind it
[6:25:42] SirShooks: hang on ... is that warcraft 2 music coming from the game? or are you playing that yourself in the background?

[6:26:12] jarilrpg: GW2 launched on steam this week
[6:26:13] eatonaround: you don't compete with other players for nodes out in the world in retail anymore right?
[6:26:16] Funderik: i was considering going back to new world to see what's what, but i'd be solo :(
[6:26:17] DiiscoViking: def warcraft 2 music
[6:26:24] Vobic13: GW2 LUL
[6:26:26] GamingDad77: @jarilrpg finally

[6:26:57] humanzd: are your dragon riding talents maxed out?
[6:27:00] LearnedSomething: do I need to link my steam account to my arena net account now?
[6:27:28] Funderik: yeah new world professions and crafting was sick, blizzard 100% got inspired by it, it's obvious.
[6:27:29] SirShooks: Towelliee, is that warcraft 2 music in-game, or are you playing that as part of your stream?
[6:27:31] Vobic13: @shytam brand new account you need
[6:27:35] Xailen: steam release was a sad attempt at getting new players and shafting old one. That game is not made for new players, only old ones
[6:27:44] xejai: Toweliee have you seen the tech with a mage bop on SLG in intermissions?
[6:27:51] matthewkshearer: I tweeted you an image of it

[6:28:05] GamingDad77: @Xailen as a new player. i can agree
[6:28:08] m4gnify: i guess you can't "migrate" to steam?
[6:28:22] dmarinn: old accounts dont work steam simple
[6:28:24] ProClicker: Hell even DayZ has been getting 40k people
[6:28:24] CrunkyBrewster: I didn't even know it was available on Steam
[6:28:34] SirShooks: Towelliee, is that warcraft 2 music in-game, or are you playing that as part of your stream?
[6:28:37] LearnedSomething: well fat lot of good it does me then :)
[6:28:39] goofywizard: Wild star would have boom in the WoW drought
[6:28:40] Kitune_Silverblade: the already exciting gw2 accs can't migrate to steam
[6:28:41] LearnedSomething: my account's ancient
[6:28:42] Mewkshake: It's because you can't link your old gw2 account to your steam

[6:30:16] Funderik: wow has to many new shiny things for ff14 to get toweliees attention right now :P
[6:30:18] JackedDown: The new raids are pretty awesome. Great music.
[6:30:18] Ybhsa: @gamingdad77 thats busted
[6:30:24] qineticc: is dragon flying mount slower on ground compared to normal ground mounts?
[6:30:27] Eraste: they're not out yet

[6:32:59] xxCameleon77xx: That bull NPC was named “BEEF”
[6:33:01] Funderik: how long till max's interview roughly?
[6:33:10] Eraste: im still kind of on the fence about DF. not a lot of people i know are coming back. s4 kinda took all their hype away
[6:33:23] procyon_mfc: they gotta move them yah
[6:33:30] Skelly310: have you tried skinning yet

[6:36:35] Funderik: gj
[6:36:48] GamingDad77: @MercUnow nope...lol
[6:36:58] andrejhmm: I hate when world quests drop unique trinkets because they are always low-level. Why do they even make them if no one is going to use them?
[6:37:16] MercUnow: Sweet jesus what an OCD killert
[6:37:32] tumb_tack: I want mimic nodes..While mining or herbing, they spawn a rare instead of giving you materials
[6:37:40] TheCliffyShow: I'm assuming later on they will add more stuff to these saves.
[6:37:42] valianya: Like how there's a krakken loa in Northrend the Kalu'ak worship

[6:40:49] TheCliffyShow: @Ybhsa That's what I was hoping for. A ghost shark just bursts out of the ground. I think there's a battle pet ability like that, except with a living shark.

[7:13:40] cynricsaxon: its mostly about s4 going into DF what they might bring over
[7:13:44] Beud_: Its about what they can take from S4 into next seasons
[7:13:52] Rudric_Ice: when is the interview ?
[7:14:06] cynricsaxon: hopefully m+ tokens to buy gear
[7:14:25] Layliah79: S4 is something we may get in DF so it's def worth to ask the right questions moving forward with this type of season.
[7:14:30] RiskyBusines_ez: How do the setup of these interviews work? Do streamers reach out to devs or opposite
[7:14:37] abracka_: @cynricsaxon that would be fucking clutcch

[7:14:59] cynricsaxon: been farming a weapon 30 dungeons and no drop... sad
[7:15:36] cynricsaxon: not in m+
[7:15:40] maidenhaur: just cap tokens and increase per tier, 1st tier one token, 2nd tier two tokens
[7:15:50] TheFox0228: @cynricsaxon that shit happened to me in a heroic. couldn't farm the weapon until someone else in my group got it and didn't need it
[7:15:52] Rudric_Ice: do pvp and u can easily get weapons
[7:15:58] ohnot___her: Ye you only get 3 coins lmao
[7:16:03] valianya: I really hope they don't put the NF seed in Dragon Isles as a new nightelf capitol.  Should base their new capitol in Kalimdor instead
[7:16:05] andrejhmm: DAMN
[7:16:21] PvtHudson093: I wish the jailor neck was on the vendor
[7:16:25] cynricsaxon: not everyone raids so m+ side would be good
[7:16:33] bllynni6614: I think the new tree in the isles is kinda neat
[7:16:41] TwoShotTV: So my fire mage has 5 new buttons to press this xpac?  They gotta do something about this ability bloat.
[7:16:51] Rudric_Ice: farm conquest u can easily get weapons thats the fastest way u can get weapons
[7:17:03] Kneckt: what sword
[7:17:10] bllynni6614: If they put the world tree there
[7:17:11] Luquva: the new world tree for nelfs
[7:17:17] Jarlan23: @TwoShotTV yeah arms warriors got a ton of new AoE abilities too like 12 buttons in total
[7:17:37] TwoShotTV: There is no way I can find this many free keybinds.

[7:17:39] spicykekw: always same justification..so we all have to raid if we want to m+?
[7:17:48] Thoreya: m+ is better than raid :)
[7:17:54] TwoShotTV: I am really worried.
[7:17:56] bot1sta: !beta

[7:18:04] valianya: Nah, Isles should stay neutral to mortal factions , not a mortal capitol on dragon lands
[7:18:06] Rudric_Ice: everyone got alot of abilities people gonna complain about have too many buttons
[7:18:14] Rudric_Ice: having*
[7:18:22] smashwow: Make the vault drop the token. Problem solved
[7:18:31] Thoreya: ^ ppl complain bout everything
[7:18:36] spicykekw: last bosses gear is higher ilvl. specific items are usually better. i mean ofc we have to raid if we want to m+....no1 will pick players without better loot from raid over someone that doesnt have those items
[7:18:37] Vivelli: just dont take those talents that give u extra buttons 4Head
[7:18:37] PvtHudson093: raid loot has been quite a bit better than M+ this season
[7:18:52] Layliah79: easier to get M+ gear then raid guild 1000%
[7:18:54] critin87: I'm late to the party can we see the DH skill tree plz
[7:18:58] stermo321: wasnt spell "2" 2 charges before? how does it work now? recharge? how many secs?
[7:19:18] braddeus: @Rudric_Ice that's why i like what they did with fury warrior, give some faceroll options with lower dps
[7:19:41] bllynni6614: @valianya where would you say a good location in kalm is? It would fit the seed being planted in the isles with the green flight working with it
[7:20:02] PvtHudson093: only fated gear
[7:20:05] Layliah79: Fated raid gear that the vendors sell
[7:20:13] Layliah79: rather u loot yourself or buy from vendor
[7:20:31] Layliah79: M+ ppl get valor to make up for it
[7:20:39] Makemesohawt: Towelliee my friend! As long as Wow continues to make content do you see yourself playing for the rest of your life or at least your professional career?
[7:20:41] cynricsaxon: could just do trinkets and weapons
[7:20:41] im_n0t_jezus: or by weapon armot type vendroes
[7:20:47] Rudric_Ice: @braddeus blizz nvr gonna do with all the other classes thats fo sure
[7:20:48] Layliah79: 298
[7:20:51] Cello_73: 298
[7:21:12] pvtpilot88: 298   and you can get 304 our of vault
[7:21:17] dudeimunknown: Whats the highest ilvl in DF atm?
[7:21:35] Jarlan23: oh thats cool
[7:21:45] Layliah79: now if +25 keys gave you higher ilvl gear at the end of your key = end tier M raid bosses. that's a thought.
[7:21:50] Layliah79: or something similar
[7:21:59] valianya: Tree should go in actual Night Elf lands if its to be their new capitol.  Maybe in the stump of Teldrassil, or down in Feralas, or up adjacent to Moonglade
[7:21:59] Dankind64: the hulk landing is way more cool
[7:22:14] Jarlan23: be funny doing that in wpvp
[7:22:16] TwoShotTV: Ha I even have a razer tartarus and a mouse with extra buttons and I still run out of keybinds as is.  Now I have blast wave, meteor, ring of frost, mas polly, greater invis, cone of cold, frozen nova...
[7:22:44] Brodih_: evereyone is hidding from you
[7:22:46] WolfofWarSong: moving too fast to have them load in?
[7:22:59] Rudric_Ice: can u world pvp while on your dragon ? cuz tht would be cool af
[7:23:00] Layliah79: You were coming in "hot"!
[7:23:01] valianya: Too fast to load in mobs
[7:23:07] elizondria: hold on did it just not remove itself
