[2:06:29] BrowneePoints: nah, why not burn out one of your tanks BEFORE the expac even launches. 5head move
[2:06:55] GamingDad77: @GamingDad77 I don't and never have played CoD. not into FPS games
[2:06:56] theoriginalzinng: thats why i thinkg the leak is a little early
[2:07:06] theoriginalzinng: lot of NYI or unworking talents yet
[2:07:17] BrowneePoints: Yea had this chat with my guild. Having the balance tuning right? Not as important. Having the DESIGN tuning nailed down? That needs finished still
[2:07:17] Blas0n: ^
[2:07:39] meltingcheese17: are you going to play wrath when it comes out?
[2:07:41] TheeLazyDuck: but they do have teams for each class right? they probably have an order of business on what they are focusing on first
[2:07:47] theoriginalzinng: and they still have no sets to test and see that its broken or not working etc
[2:08:13] theoriginalzinng: like thats gonna take some time, not including tuning to make shit not op
[2:08:34] Blas0n: yep haha
[2:08:36] kokochris: Obvious bugs...
[2:08:39] raldrik: They would say that again in 2 months. Devs always feel they want more time. If you listened to devs DF would release right around the time of Ashes
[2:08:44] Blas0n: Then tune during Heroic week
[2:08:46] kokochris: there is an acceptable level of bugs
[2:08:53] damare91: Hey having access to Arms/Hpal and Unholy/Hpal , for ONLY the S5 which comp would you recommand to push high and grind ladder in 2s?

[2:09:39] kokochris: they do not even discuss that danLUL
[2:09:42] BigDiezel: @Towelliee correct me if im wrong but there is no announced release date
[2:10:02] GamingDad77: @BigDiezel correct. onl;y leaked
[2:10:03] Maglore85: @BigDiezel they said 2022, if I recall
[2:10:03] mikejames01: no raid testing would be ugh lol
[2:10:09] luckfore: current beta build is broken now, crashes all over the place
[2:10:19] Blas0n: yeah raid testing after WOTLK launch for sure
[2:10:22] messinna: Towel  i just start SL  i made a pause this Xpac.  whats the average ILvl   for a player
[2:10:32] Gooseberries: Could be following same philosophy as last three boss of SoD
[2:10:32] Seerated: Yea, that is weird isn't it ?! Usually well into alpha/beta when raidtesting etc is happening
[2:10:35] mikejames01: what was the leak date
[2:10:38] TheeLazyDuck: lets be real here class tuning is always gonna be bad/good and always changing there is never gonna be prefect tuning
[2:10:41] Blas0n: @messinna 300+
[2:10:45] kokochris: im glad they didnt put out a RD yet
[2:11:06] messinna: i saaid average dont troll me
[2:11:11] theoriginalzinng: if sets arent testable in the next 2 weeks then im confident it wont make it lol
[2:11:17] messinna: 300 is mythic level
[2:11:38] leaprah: they havent given an offical date yet though right ?
[2:11:43] reggiepowa: its quite possible they dont make set bonuses for first tier, there is plenty of new stuff even without them
[2:11:48] supernohva_xt: @messinna yea 300 is average
[2:11:53] GamingDad77: @messinna all my toons are around 230-240. I doont raid
[2:11:54] Funderik: they over shoot their target release dates i've heard to give themselves some space for betas etc. so delays aren't common.
[2:12:01] Belasard: @messinna my pala is like 260-270
[2:12:20] Austei: i got to 270 without mythic plus or normal raids
[2:12:21] Thewunk: I'm thinking right when WOTLK drops we will get the confirmed release date for Dragonflight
[2:12:23] theoriginalzinng: you can level in DF in 180 gear
[2:12:25] theoriginalzinng: so
[2:12:31] Phil87z: They released the things going away with DF recently they are shooting for that leaked date

[2:12:47] messinna: 260-270   is more likely to belive cause i was in game  in last week and probably like that
[2:13:01] Blas0n: @findobin my man you better drink some energy drinks and grind
[2:13:05] Aidler: around 275 is possible after the fated raids

[2:13:52] rolando415: Im 287
[2:13:56] TheeLazyDuck: you can easily start df with 180 tho thats what evokers starts with and felt alright to level with
[2:13:57] whiteskii: how is guardian looking in df
[2:13:58] Bayne77: i thought the gear drops started at 180 for lvl 60s

[2:47:03] leaprah: i think the way this quest works is that if you geta a ghost, you need to kill a ghost before getting a ghoul
[2:47:16] gritbarontv: but they get turn into mulch after you turn them in, lol
[2:47:17] Tyrammus84: the worst quest in my opinion of the DK starting area is the one where you beat the scarlet people into submission to ge tthem to talk

[2:51:48] luiiiggi: Hi @Towelliee what tank you liked the most from tanking in beta ?
[2:51:51] BrowneePoints: The bones of the game were great. The problem was not enough incentive to keep playing, and bungling the endgame @Bogzeh
[2:51:53] Ziephier: you could not skin all the animals you killed in Wild Star
[2:51:54] ndilicious: Imagine what could've been if they let Wildstar cook an additional year before releasing it FeelsStrongMan

[2:52:53] BrowneePoints: Also, it's hard to overstate how GOOD Visually(even though it had a cartoonish art style) Wildstar looked
[2:52:59] BrowneePoints: the Art Design team put in work
[2:53:04] lukepizzaguy: gitaarpianoluuk subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 22 months! 
[2:53:34] GamingDad77: this is the worst part about the quest....slow asws flying
[2:53:36] Breakernaut: The problem with Wildstar is that it was ahead of the time. I think if it would have been released a little later and really built off how bad WoD was it would have done amazing
[2:54:04] 91Niki: @Bogzeh The reason why it failed was because they insisted so hard on making it hardcore. The game was amazing, but too hardcore for todays crowd. So it didn't make enough money for ncsoft to continue to support it.
[2:54:07] Nokterian: ResidentSleeper  slow flying
[2:54:09] BrowneePoints: The problem with Wildstar is they catered to the wrong crows(vanilla WoW diehards) with 40 man raids, and generally bungled the endgame
[2:54:11] xxplicitt: Wildstars biggest problem was that the endgame was focused in really really hardcore demographic

[2:54:41] grumpnamedjosh: i forgot how long that quest chain was till i did it. i just wanted the quick mount
[2:54:42] jasperboy: Only thing I cared about, is that blizz wont budge on the dungeon finder
[2:55:01] BrowneePoints: and this was before FF14 REALLY took off, so building in lateral systems to keep players engaged was not a thing on everyone's mind
[2:55:01] spookychefkarolina: @jasperboy SAME
[2:55:06] TrixStar36: Felt like it lasted 15 minutes and he pretty much asked the same questions as everyone else
[2:55:07] jasperboy: With Brian Birmingham
[2:55:08] 91Niki: If ncsoft wasn't so quick to drop it, and allow the devs to tune the hardcoreness down, Wildstar would still be alive today and probably thriving

[3:10:49] DeathLV: Arthas becomes 5 Stygia
[3:10:51] 91Niki: @pk99 I think you are confusing twitch prime, and twitch turbo. You get ads with prime unless it's the streamer you used your prime sub with. Turbo doesn't get ads ;) It's all good, honest mistake

[3:11:44] 91Niki: @freetherocktv Yo, just drop it

[3:12:21] mikejames01: there is 3 up there
[3:12:24] GarfielfArbuncle: Even with the problems with the jailer, the shadowlands kinda run into the Midiclorian problem where they sucked up far too much of the mystery in the setting.

[3:13:55] P4wnder: in the houses
[3:14:01] P4wnder: yep
[3:14:01] GarfielfArbuncle: They can retroactively make Shadowlands a little bit better by revealing Denathrius was really behind whatever big evil thing the Jailer was complaining about before he died.
[3:14:33] Yarles: or you could explain what jailer actually wanted or was afraid of
[3:14:39] Sollice: I dont want to think of anything SL related during DF

[3:15:02] 91Niki: 15.0 HYPERS
[3:15:02] DecayedmiNt: The big bad void

[3:15:08] Roaringkittylol: Downtime expansion
[3:15:10] HaxzorJimDuggan: maybe at the very end of dragonflight
[3:15:13] jasperboy: @Sollice I dont wanna think of anything revolving mythic SLG and Sire Danny
[3:15:14] The_U1timatum: he was holding off the next expansion because it wasn’t ready yet @towelliee
[3:15:14] Boggogroggo: yeah get away from sci-fi
[3:15:15] lithium364: i thought he was talking about afrasiabi returning as lead dev MonkaS
[3:15:19] Boggogroggo: back to fantasy
[3:15:28] minael1: and also the chance to create rainbow dragons, which we didn't have before
[3:15:30] GarfielfArbuncle: @lithium364 LULW
[3:15:31] xxplicitt: I hope they slowly move away from the massive cosmic threats and give us players a breather, some time to enjoy Azeroth again
[3:15:38] The_U1timatum: now we’re doomed
[3:15:44] superb0y: superb0y subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 53 months! 
[3:15:57] GarfielfArbuncle: I get the feeling this is the expansion where Magatha Grimtotem finally goes down.
[3:15:58] ShadoodHD: ... why do i get the feeling they're gonna pull an endwalker story fighting dark and light with a 3rd party instigator like the jailor bs

[3:16:20] Roaringkittylol: We really need Hogger and Defias brotherhood raids. Saving a farmer from bandits. Rather than killing gods.
[3:16:21] Boggogroggo: it'd be cool to actually deal with the void-lord and ethereal threats
[3:16:25] fbirobertmueller805: wtih all this twitch drama, i fell bad for small streamers like yourself
[3:16:27] HaloS23: @Towelliee Danuser said this was the end of the 1st story arc didnt he?

[3:16:38] KeyOnRestarting: light of the flight
[3:16:40] chriar: This xpac needs to set up tyrande as the next big bad, cmon

[3:17:19] mikejames01: overlay is on @Towelliee
[3:17:22] Roaringkittylol: True, The Defias brotherhood is missing in action. They could make a combat and take the throne of SW>
[3:17:25] GarfielfArbuncle: I guess Yrel's always out there though I'd really just let her stay gone.

[4:23:44] Thirtys3v3n: I like how you can't smoke weed but you can sit in a hot tub and shake your money maker to get people to pay you to write their name on your body.
[4:23:55] 91Niki: @Maydie6066 Anything that is natural, green tea and vitamins. But even natural energy can be bad for you if you get too much of it ;)
[4:23:58] UnoBoxo: We were working on the mobile app to make it better
[4:24:40] spookychefkarolina: @maydie6066 yes however the banned ingredient is DMAA I believe. Which raises your blood pressure and specifically causes a range of cardiovascular issues. In short - it doesn’t need to be in monster, but unfortunately in the US it is.
[4:24:55] freetherocktv: @NoTToXiCLuL makes them forget about the shitty things in life or things they are currently dealing with, I had a roommate 15 years ago that would do it
[4:24:56] Maydie6066: @Maydie6066 something... advanced maybe :P

[5:05:20] 91Niki: @stratiss I mean, that is really no different than our commands in chat, and Towelliee isn't sponsored to have those.. Just an easier way than having to repeat things in chat when people ask questions

[5:19:58] HaxzorJimDuggan: even if they leave they still watched part of an ad so thats money dude Kappa
[5:19:59] blowsupalot: Oh i just realized i got a gifted sub TY so much
[5:20:01] Lenietwitch: yeah, i dont understand this "i'm a free add streamer" that doesnt fit these days imo
[5:20:11] ramsowo: @Towelliee I watched you back in original WOTLK or Cata maybe? Super cool youre still streaming :D
[5:20:12] Anexros: i'm seeing a lot of streamers do giveaways while they run ads and then come back when there chat has chilled spamming the keyword, one way to do it lol
[5:20:15] Strifelol: I feel bad for staff that will be working TwitchCon :x
[5:20:16] theoriginalzinng: for the low low price of twitch prime you can watch towelliee with no ads
[5:20:23] Mecabeast: regular TV is 5mins every 25mins
[5:20:29] stallowned: tv ads u get 3min of tv and 5min of ads LUL
[5:20:30] dawgystyle_13: I've got Nitro. no adds. i love for $9.
[5:20:31] Rakim88: @91Niki oh dont get me wrong prime subs r not really going down really cause of the show. but i do worry for the show reaching its 5 season planned cause its cost is so high n its not reaching crazy numbers saddly. house of dragons is killing ring of powers right now.
[5:20:33] campingking615: Me being a king lurker I don’t mind adds
[5:20:35] skrin001: if you dont want adds just sub or twitch turbo then you wont get them.
[5:20:49] Effin_Steffin: 20 Mins ads for every Hour of content.
[5:20:49] cookie_jayy: Turbo gang EZ
[5:20:49] vikingskog: i cant watch tv anymore, the amount of ads there is intolerable
[5:20:51] PokerFaceMoose: a "1 hour" show is only 44 mins because there are 16 mins of add per 1 hour time slot
[5:20:54] Darkaon: Because twitch is a fucking dumpster fire
[5:20:56] Darkaon: literally

[5:20:57] huhwhyinbred: ads are the wrong way to make money. period.
[5:20:58] s3ru_mano: Try watch nfl lol i feel is like 90% of ads
[5:21:01] Nottinghams: Thier operating costs seem pretty sus tho , considering uses aws backbone lol
[5:21:01] Aidler: regular tv has something like 20 min ads per hour during primetime
[5:21:06] Wukain: my problem with ads are you get a block of ads then if you have to reload or go to a diffrent streamer boom more ads
[5:21:06] 210Crawler: pretty much
[5:21:06] dawgystyle_13: i heard a BELL in your DBM and immediately went to Taco Bell...... BONG
[5:21:09] Templexx: facts
[5:21:10] Epiclawlzable: probably needed to get it into the 3rd quarter for business reasons
[5:21:11] 3dRes: Here in the UK, watch a half an hour programme and you get around 2-4 minutes of ads. An hour programme and you get around 10 minutes of ads @Towelliee
[5:21:11] cookie_jayy: What are ADs?
[5:21:12] Eviltuna13: The only part I hate about ads is when something good is going on and get hit with 3 min of ads
[5:21:14] Bowski86: ive never been a sub, and i love ur ads. its how i support you  :D
[5:21:20] add_parmesan: its cool, im a lurker so ill just leave during ads but thats all part of it
[5:21:26] novikono: @Towelliee I pay for turbo and I dont get adds from any channel i watch
[5:21:26] OhNoNotAgain: OhNoNotAgain gifted a Tier 1 sub to WildStar! They have given 407 Gift Subs in the channel! 
[5:21:29] ProClicker: Jeff Bezos dropped to 3rd in the richest man list, the cut was needed
[5:21:31] huhwhyinbred: I'm happy not support the websites that block as blockers
[5:21:33] FleuryGG: especially as a non-sub the least you can do is sit through a few ads
[5:21:35] llNoTToXiCll: it just got annoying to try and watch streamers playing a game and get interuppted by full screen ads i think if an ad comes up it should replace the top Video instead of the streamer that way we can see the add still but watch the streamer playing
[5:21:42] freetherocktv: @Towelliee most shows are 42minutes because of 18minutes of ads, 30min shows are 21min usually
[5:21:44] novikono: Turbo is a great deal for 8.99 a month
[5:21:46] Rakim88: the ad problem is coming to all streaming services. disney+ will have ads too. same for hbo max
[5:21:48] KronasKG: @Towelliee  What benifet is there for having viewers with Twitch Nitro or whatever its called.
[5:21:55] ijuki: WildStar PepeHands
[5:21:56] cookie_jayy: I love twitch turbo
[5:22:12] novikono: @cookie_jayy i agree its so good
[5:22:16] Buckwink: yeha if the ads werent literal peak cringe it wouldnt be so bad
[5:22:17] freetherocktv: @cookie_jayy same here I can't watch twitch without turbo
[5:22:19] 91Niki: @Towelliee ads are also region specific
[5:22:22] Aidler: yeah, turbo is my thing too. I hope it stays. they don’t advertise for it very much….
[5:22:25] Crowargus: twitch turbo is looking enticing now more so than what it used to be
[5:22:29] alpha_liontv: could do like packages of ads based on type
[5:22:29] dawgystyle_13: Hey! 3minutes is all some guys need.  :P
[5:22:40] Sollice: @Aidler Why would they. They probably make less off turbo than ads lol
[5:22:41] Molvonos: towSweat towSweat
[5:22:44] Nottinghams: Im happy with ad ever 15 / 30 mins. Just dont roll like 6/9 of them lol
[5:22:48] freetherocktv: I love getting no ads on the PS4 and Switch and phone
[5:22:48] Gullerback: the only thing ill bitch about is pre-rolls. i dont wana click on new streamers and have to watch 3 min of ads first.
[5:22:54] jace2010: price of subs going up next
[5:23:04] Aidler: @sollice that’s my fear too
[5:23:06] angelbutt3: kool
[5:23:15] jaalexba: passive aggressive
[5:23:16] Mecabeast: if prime subs go away I'll just get nitro and cancel my prime membership
[5:23:20] Rakim88: meanwhile ninja streaming on 6 different platforms LUL
[5:23:26] lel3owski: @Gullerback yeah the preroll garbage is actually a negative, i just straight leave if it doesn't get blocked
[5:23:31] ProfessorChaoos: DF talent trees are so much fun, the loadout part and import part its all awesome
[5:23:31] w1ns1ow: is there a weakaura link?
[5:23:33] freetherocktv: @Gullerback that is why turbo is so good, can switch between unlimited number of streamers and never see an ad
[5:23:34] apopthis: look bottom line.  Folks need to make money.  Ads make money.  Money makes the world go round.
[5:23:35] WhiteKnight74648: Yeah Bajheera streamed on youtube for the first time recently
[5:23:37] Hestert: twitch turbo is ELITE\

[5:23:46] sosadu: not wrong

[5:24:03] DevilSpire: @towelliee so they basically made it harder for some random to start streaming….
[5:24:06] Aidler: only a bad marriage can stop Ninja
[5:24:36] sosadu: LMFAO
[5:24:38] freetherocktv: Google is "google" because of their adsense algorithim
[5:24:42] blowsupalot: that would be the end
[5:24:43] stallowned: no way LUL

[5:25:01] c0mmander_starscream: Amazon sells Twitch to "Micro$oft"
[5:25:11] RUSTbomb: tbh streamers make too much. shouldn't be a millionaire from playing games.  no one will agree but if twitch is going under thats probably why
[5:25:28] Molvonos: @RUSTbomb Weird take, but ok

[5:25:54] Boggogroggo: they make millions
[5:25:57] cahoots82: streaming is just playing video games, I don't know why people think it's so hard /s
[5:25:58] fearlessfungi: People make money selling bathwater... LULW
[5:26:00] RUSTbomb: @RUSTbomb spot on bud
[5:26:03] hwiyo: That's so like 1950 thought
[5:26:08] Sollice: @RUSTbomb I love this thought. You realize it's not the streamers who pay themselves...its the people watching the stream that think they are that valueable
[5:26:10] Molvonos: "Comedians make too much..." "Sports Athletes make too much..." "Politicians make too much..."
[5:26:12] vikingskog: havent played mobile games since snake back in 2000
[5:26:16] tyler2tall89: it seems easier than it is. You dont really get a day off starting off as a streamer

[5:26:30] Rakim88: streamers r just the new age entertainer chatter FailFish
[5:26:31] Aidler: if Twitch goes down someone else will take over. streaming will stay
[5:26:31] Maydie6066: we all know @Sollice works very hard for the stream, and @91Niki just ban hammers people Kappa
[5:26:31] RubbleyJ: streamers are essentially entertainers so you have to be entertaining lol
[5:26:36] Lenietwitch: also talking for 8 hours stright is hard as fuck, mentally and vocally at least, ppl has no idea
[5:26:37] llNoTToXiCll: @glubbietv  he replied to his thread
[5:26:38] 3dRes: That person just made their stance, and now are no doubt laughing their heads off because we are riled up just like they wanted KEKW
[5:26:43] SilkeySmooth: twitch shouldnt give exclusive contracts thats where they lost money
[5:26:54] MILESkg21: streaming will never die LuL
[5:26:57] DeCoyThatGuy: people streaming, are like sports players. all they have to do, is show up, do their thing, have people see them do their thing and they get paid.
[5:27:00] PigPenLen: troll take, not hot take o
[5:27:01] JayBron_Lames: lol what?
[5:27:02] Molvonos: @3dRes Nah, most of us correcting that line of thought aren't riled up cause we know better.

[5:27:39] Rakim88: fucking up the bag for someone not cool chatter DansGame
[5:27:39] XshadowturkeyX: if yolu look up how much avg viewers a streamerr gets its like 27
[5:27:39] angelbutt3: 7
[5:27:40] Sneekzx: if twitch goes under, I guess YouTube will be the next platform ppl stream on?
[5:27:42] Lenietwitch: @freetherocktv yea that's my point, like is not only "playing games" streamers usually engage and talk with chat, so is far from easy
[5:27:49] 91Niki: Why did chat just turn into "eat the rich" KEKW
[5:27:55] 91Niki: I was gone for 2min
[5:28:13] 3dRes: @Molvonos that's not how they looked at it. Making a dumb take in a stream, with a chat, who knows how to react properly was their motive
[5:28:19] MILESkg21: Steal from the rich to feed the poor KEKW
[5:28:20] jkitchin75: how is twitch going under if amazon own it
[5:28:21] jaalexba: YOu have to have 5 accounts
[5:28:23] synistersyn007: Explaine to me what makes Your contract exclusive
[5:28:27] cahoots82: You merely adapted WoW, I was born into it!

[5:28:53] 91Niki: MOAR
[5:28:54] synistersyn007: Cool
[5:29:01] Molvonos: @3dRes Making a dumb hot take in channel just gets you mocked, not necessarily making people upset. Its a towCringe  kinda moment.

[5:29:07] jkitchin75: @synistersyn007 why should he
[5:29:12] Vivelli: baller
[5:29:16] freetherocktv: @Towelliee and you can't stream on other live platforms?
[5:29:41] SilkeySmooth: and you wonder why twitch is broke
[5:29:45] synistersyn007: Like hulk hogans
[5:29:47] zeiours: @towelliee do you think blizzard will announce xpac announcement during wrath release?
[5:29:49] Lenietwitch: the only restriction you have is that you can't strem in other platforms ? towSweat
[5:29:56] Aidler: well, Blizz took streamer as free advertisement and streamers grew with WoW. it was/is mutually beneficial
[5:30:04] jaalexba: How rich is TheGunRun?
[5:30:22] igotadealforyou: damn!
[5:30:28] XshadowturkeyX: i cant believe in 3 days i would of bben watching twitch for 10 years omg
[5:30:33] unc0de: so its like salary + comission
[5:30:40] 3dRes: @Molvonos i worded it poorly, and now is see that LUL I dislike people who know what they're doing when saying stupid stuff such as that
[5:30:54] c0mmander_starscream: So no mixer
[5:30:59] freetherocktv: @Towelliee you can do youtube because its not live right?
[5:31:20] grumpnamedjosh: you can still upload to other places though so its almost irrelevant that they make you be exclusive
[5:31:29] traviiz: exclusivity means they also pay you the opportunity cost to NOT stream or put live content elsewhere
[5:31:37] Molvonos: @3dRes lol, no worries homie.  People making silly comments like that are entertainment all their own.  towNut1
[5:31:57] Aidler: @xshadowturkeyx yeah, crazy when you think of things like that. I almost stopped watching regular TV during that time and only watch streams
[5:32:29] jace2010: monkaS
[5:32:39] Rottencoarse: u want us to unsub??? :D
[5:32:47] Eshel: @aidler  Streams are better than regular tv anyway …. You get to participate in streams :)

[5:34:09] whoogz: what about asmonbald money?
[5:34:10] Wukain: I believe streamers should pay to be on a site companies come to the streamer to run ads that way the streamer gets to choose what his channel is promoting and the site doesn't care cause they have made there money up front also that allows the streamer to stream on as many platforms as they want

[5:36:19] HaloS23: @Towelliee in your opinion, how much truth is there to the Twitch being sold to Tencent?
[5:36:24] Torse9: It'd be so strange to see you be a variety streamer after all these years
[5:36:32] Bayne77: dem tip jars coming back

[5:37:10] 91Niki: Yeah unless you already have an established community, like Dan, Cohh, Lirik and more, as a variety streamer. Odds are you won't survive in that world

[5:42:07] c0mmander_starscream: In the year 20 Swiming in New World
[5:42:10] KronasKG: @Towelliee  I understand if you can't say but does your Contract state you have to play wow because thts where your fan base is. I know you would play anyway but is that in there that they understand your fans?

[5:47:20] Famous54: lol WoW 2 would crush a Riot MMO release though
[5:47:23] board4life65: wow 2?
[5:47:36] Retpally9329: Riots been sitting there watching Blizzard fuck up 2 expansions straight , they're foaming at the mouth
[5:47:40] Arbszy: 2025 maybe
[5:47:40] 91Niki: There is no wow 2 tho FailFish
[5:47:47] x_EGZODYA_x: riot game gona be bird eye view like diablo so its gona be pretty much shiet i dont think game like that can beat wow
[5:47:49] MILESkg21: ACTUAL BILLIONS

[5:47:56] demonicyoshi: prob better talent too
[5:47:58] SilkeySmooth: there will never be a wow 2 blizzard is still milking the wo player base for tokens
[5:47:58] NerdyTeK: so did amazon and look at new world
[5:48:00] Boggogroggo: yeah, they'd have to really flub it
[5:48:05] Oldduketree007: Wow have activitions no wonder they don't have money xD
[5:48:05] ibamoose: Hogwartz Legacy???
[5:48:10] MILESkg21: look what happened to NW though OMEGALUL

[5:48:14] LilPe: isnt f2p worse
[5:48:16] Roaringkittylol: LOL ^
[5:48:17] weirdoj: f2p means it's probably gonna be bad
[5:48:18] Buckwink: LOL
[5:48:23] Maydie6066: @91Niki World of Warcraft 2: the Warier Warcraftier
[5:48:26] piratechris: It could also be ass so there is that too
[5:48:28] lordg1zmo: watch it be for mobile lol
[5:48:35] Zenithgear: @Towelliee it wont come out in the next 3 years they are still looking for a dedicated team to produce the game. They are currently hiring to make the mmo dream a reality
[5:48:35] 91Niki: @weirdoj What kind of logic is that?! LOL
[5:48:35] Keglett: 10"Billion"Cent
[5:48:36] jkitchin75: why is f2p bad?
[5:48:40] generaljosh721: HL doesn't have online play lol
[5:48:45] Rakim88: Hmm i really wonder if other riot gamers like will move over to playing riot mmo. i have my doubts they can transfer over the T1, rae or pokis to play it outside promotion stream.
[5:48:50] barefax: I enjoyed Lost Ark,  never dropped a time.  Main story was great.
[5:48:54] 91Niki: f2p doesn't equal bad LUL what kinda dumb logic is that
[5:48:56] Aidler: so Blizz going to MS is also a concentration move
[5:48:57] barefax: dime*
[5:49:00] Cosmolus: 0
[5:49:02] K_A_N_J_I: It’s about longevity when new world came out people were laying wow to rest but over time that proved to not be the case. I imagine riot mmo will be similar but we will have to wait and see the longevity @towelliee
[5:49:02] MILESkg21: 0
[5:49:04] Roaringkittylol: Valorant

[5:49:13] velathore: Even their Netflix show was decent @Towelliee
[5:49:19] Boggogroggo: if the game visually looks like arcane, it'd be damn cool
[5:49:22] leaprah: with arcane and all, the most important part is that they have a story to back up the MMO, wow and FF14 are successful in part because of that too
[5:49:26] Lenietwitch: i hate LOL but i can't argue that is not popular LOL
[5:49:29] abracka_: @Towelliee checkout that new runeterra book Ruination shits pretty good
[5:49:30] ChalupaBatman25: the only thing blizzard could of had to go toe to toe with a riot mmo was classic wow launch and even that is iffy
[5:49:36] Arbszy: He has a new video
[5:49:38] jkitchin75: @LilPe still does not mean there bad
[5:49:39] Cosmolus: Valorant is what Overwatch should been
[5:49:40] Arbszy: about classes
[5:49:40] piratechris: I haven't liked a single Riot game yet so

[5:49:44] Roaringkittylol: I just hope the artwork and color pallate isnt washed out
[5:49:55] 91Niki: @91Niki People on some heavy towCopium
[5:50:02] ogRixis: They've been working on it since at least 2014 when Ghostcrawler joined. It will be guaranteed to come out flying.
[5:50:05] LilPe: @jkitchin75 yea, like i said, just my opinion. it's all subjective
[5:50:09] ogRixis: BLizzard gonna be scared
[5:50:14] TheUnknowing: I think the riot mmo will do just fine
[5:50:16] HaloS23: @Towelliee You think time spent in WoW thus far will sway people on which game they stick with? I find myself not playing other games due to this or something in another game reminds me of wow and I come back.
[5:50:19] Oldduketree007: retri with the boosted gear pops in pvp for some reason xD
[5:50:25] Boggogroggo: The Arcane art style was sick

[5:54:21] bazziiiTV: i dont think there will ever be a wow2. its more likely they do with wow sth like they do with ow2. not really a sequel, but more of a major update/overhaul
[5:54:25] ContraRob: I boosted a Wrath character, do you recommend do anything to prepare for Wrath aside from professions?

[5:56:31] Gian_Cena: @Towelliee the horde are cucks LMAO
[5:56:34] MILESkg21: HAHAHHAHA
[5:56:38] 91Niki: The only reason Blizzard would ever do wow 2, is if they want to do something with the game that the current engine can't support, and they'd wanna move it to a new engine. Which won't happen unless they get completely bottle necked, kinda like GGG is getting with POE, which is why they are doing POE2.
[5:56:38] Wukain: all the players that care about the game went horde
