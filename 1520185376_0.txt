[1:07:34] cappei: Pretty weird how slowly they release talent trees if Alpha is really soon. Or maybe they won't show all before then?
[1:07:42] Artivicii: wow is life 4Head

[1:12:16] lithium364: for more drama
[1:12:28] klindatu: Do you think that the new talent trees will affect the mage tower difficulty? or will Blizz just block half of the trees from working inside?
[1:12:50] raye_gaming22: and priests are locked into the PI tree too they cant skill other shit
[1:13:02] raye_gaming22: cuz its to OP

[2:03:52] paravak: I think this is gonna be another case of blizz trying to add something cool and unique into the game but the community will see it as a 0.1% dps loss against something else and deem it completely useless

[2:25:09] Inzidious: scourge event
[2:27:37] Inzidious: all i want on the fresh realms is the Blessed Battlegear of Undead Slaying set :)
[2:27:51] Aaradin: I could be wrong but for th most part on a fresh server, youd just want to level and get quest gear as you hit 60,70,80 and not try to do raids that are in wrath for awhile, since each next expansions quest gear is usually as good or better than the previous tier raid gear or similar anyway
[2:27:55] Varsader: avenging wrath within 30 seconds?
[2:27:56] Aaradin: i could be wrong i guess tho
[2:28:06] Aaradin: that arent in wrath

[2:28:16] Varsader: nope
[2:28:42] Varsader: didn't see any debuff weird
[2:28:44] Cyrukh: not for wings only for bubble
[2:28:50] Rudric_Ice: the new season is on Aug 3rd right ?
[2:28:51] PvtHudson093: forbearance?
[2:29:00] ShadoodHD: isnt it forbearance?
[2:29:12] Nachozdood: :( wish i had beta
[2:29:13] Cyrukh: yea forbearance never showed for wings
[2:29:55] eolf1337: i don't think there ever was a 30sec forb debuff
[2:30:36] Nachozdood: @Towelliee i remeber playing back in the day and nobody crying about prot warriors and them clearing all content back then am i remembering wrong and the warmaine kids right?
[2:31:05] ShadoodHD: weird, i remember it always there when wings popped back in wrath 🤷
[2:31:16] Cyrukh: prot warriors in wrath arent bad, its just the other tanks are faaaaaar better
[2:31:43] Varsader: only thing I'm going to complain about is a titans grip warrior with shadowmourne one shotting me.
[2:31:49] Nachozdood: alot of peeps saying id be a fool to take my warrior as my main vs playing some other tank
[2:32:06] Herzenliegen: Bear tanks we're good in Wrath
[2:32:10] Broomba: Lol comparing a class from retail, classic rewrite of lich king a private server
[2:32:32] Anoia22: just play whatever you want and you will be fine
[2:32:59] Lasidor: Icy touch tanks and prot pallies lol
[2:33:10] Broomba: Too many people see someone play a class and thinking i want to be meta too
[2:33:23] rudericus: God forbit people choose a class they enjoy rather than the best
[2:33:32] Redhed_Iou: you gonna be playing wrath classic?
[2:34:10] Aaradin: i geared up a survival hunter in 9.0 just because it was the most fun class ive ever played tbh.  Turns out they became insane, so that was cool lol, but just play what you like to play.
[2:34:20] paravak: I'm looking forward to playing ele shaman despite it apparently being C or D tier to some people, cos throwing large clumps of lava at shit is my jam
[2:34:26] Zolshy89: yo towelie did you talk raid nerfs? CR cutoff?
[2:34:37] Zolshy89: *CE
[2:35:13] Cyrukh: @paravak ele is fine for the few first tiers but drops off quick, it still blasts in pvp
[2:36:02] Nachozdood: Ele is what i played back in the day and it was a blast all expansion long
[2:36:07] Zolshy89: I care I just started pulling jailer
[2:36:08] jkitchin75: so was it that overtuned to start with
[2:36:16] Zolshy89: worried about CR

[2:37:52] Zolshy89: 200 or 300 would of been ok
[2:38:16] Zolshy89: killed anduin pre big nerf
[2:38:17] Nachozdood: hmm do yall think Blizz will remove the Black and plagued proto drakes like they did in OG wrath?
[2:38:18] Rudric_Ice: how much is mythic jailer going for ?
[2:38:25] Cyrukh: you cant make everyone happy but i guess they could just release content hard af so that the top 1% can have fun wiping thousand times and after worldfirst is done they should nerf it for the other 99%
[2:38:29] Zolshy89: and killed rygelon this week

[2:39:35] Varsader: @ShinerShawn ulduar was fun for a couple months, ICC was boring AF.
[2:39:36] Cyrukh: @shinershawn there is a reason why wrath is and always was the most used content on private servers
[2:39:41] Zolshy89: I've gotten CE with nerfs, it's more so the 4 weeks the amount of time to get CE feels slugged AF
[2:40:02] ShinerShawn: @Varsader heard
[2:40:08] Rudric_Ice: can't wait to see MORE RMP in DF......
[2:40:19] ShinerShawn: @Cyrukh i see, i guess i never played private servers
[2:40:45] Zolshy89: also why rush s4 who tf wants to play that? just let me finish current tier
[2:40:58] Villie: thats sick]
[2:41:18] Villie: ye
[2:41:38] Cyrukh: wrath is just the perfect base kit. its tryhard enough cause not everyone did lod or undying etc but it was accessible enough for everyone with daily dungeons being able to get you full tier set
[2:41:39] Villie: i think thats the bis combo coming into wrath
[2:41:55] Cyrukh: enough QoL stuff but not everything gets shoved up your butt
[2:41:57] ShinerShawn: @Varsader I did read after quyitting that Ulduar was an AMAZING raid
[2:42:36] Vizzeek: devastator might as well not exist now
[2:42:56] jkitchin75: dont go to the light
[2:43:20] ShinerShawn: @Cyrukh head, so I if I stuck with it after havin g to redo naxx, i might of had a good experinece?
[2:44:08] Varsader: @ShinerShawn Ulduar was amazing, but it's also determined by who you're playing with I guess. My guild died in Ulduar due to the legendary hammer drama... lmfao
[2:45:29] Vizzeek: sylvannus seems like such a joke of a fight compared to jailer. at least from a heroic view
[2:45:34] grumpnamedjosh: Good morning all
[2:45:56] KingWrightDev: how does wrath paladin feel compared to tbc

[2:49:18] Eviltuna13: Why are people freaking about PI staying in the game how else can i pop it on hunter pets cohhFee

[2:59:31] lithium364: im sure evokers have something similiar to PI aswell which will be super busted
[3:00:11] StoicTaurus: Oh yeah .. support evoker is supposed to use bronze dragon magic, time releated.
[3:00:16] naraudin: @vadergod1980 what do you mean?
[3:00:25] Villie: what is the class color?

[3:00:42] Jarless: "never seen before"??? LOL
[3:00:58] Armdel: @Villie greenish
[3:00:59] Nachozdood: kinda wish the new class wasnt locked to the new race
[3:01:25] Jarless: high doubt it will be new , just rehash
[3:01:28] Rudric_Ice: but we have seen the dracthyr dance which is more important Kappa
[3:01:29] Zolshy89: actually my dad works at blizz
[3:01:33] Zolshy89: I have Kappa
[3:01:52] Cyrukh: the dracthyr should look bulkier
[3:01:53] notColt45: Did people say that with DH?
[3:01:55] lithium364: apparently pandatv is playing envoker right now Kappa
[3:02:01] Aquadriel: keep it like this for the expansion, and open other classes at end of DF
[3:02:02] Nachozdood: thats kinda what people said about DH and its still elves only
[3:02:15] Cyrukh: right now they look like soyboys wearing draon horns and paint on scales

[3:03:12] Rottencoarse: @Towelliee  red shirt guy
[3:03:18] StoicTaurus: Evoker kinda always will be Drakthyr only (as much as we can talk about always in WoW).  Drakthyrs will get new classes later.
[3:03:25] R2RHIN0: Hopefully Demon Hunters get the same treatment
[3:03:45] DallTV_: dang you i wanna see that clip now
[3:03:54] Rudric_Ice: i want Orc demon hunter
[3:03:58] Nachozdood: if we ever end up with a true classic plus do you think they should open up most of the classes to most of the races? personally love Tauren pally and cant stand elves

[3:13:03] ShadoodHD: oooo the TIME gating
[3:13:14] szble: prob will have to do the main questline once
[3:13:30] Cyrukh: i think he means like the 2nd legendary belt cause you just fall behind if you dont have your 2nd legendary

[3:14:37] thekl0wn2: I just wish they would make the ZM quest line account wide I’m tired of doing it

[3:15:30] Rudric_Ice: last question

[3:16:26] PvtHudson093: more things to do with sandworn relics
[3:16:56] Cyrukh: i think tbc and wrath collections and progress should be account wide too but mostly achievements and mounts

[3:19:16] Cyrukh: because its work for them
[3:19:38] SirVoro: Yup
[3:19:50] PToastman: im doing my own project 60 right now. I have monk and paladin left
[3:19:50] Mattsta: it could just be because it takes some amount of work that they could be putting into DF instead

[3:20:24] xReadyAimMissx: happens to the best of us LUL
[3:20:26] Nejba: I'm guessing they are leaving such a QoL change like EVERYTHING account-wide for DF. Huge selling point
[3:20:47] abracka_: that 6.2 patch for FFXIV looks interesting. they might be creating their own version of mythic plus content
[3:20:50] Thoreya: maybe they just assume everyone has tier so they dont think its abig deal
[3:22:08] abracka_: yeah, timed and you don't come back from dying
[3:22:19] DoubleNova: it's just different difficulties
[3:23:05] Nicstar1007: Its timelimited but you can finish it over the time but it will be harder then
[3:23:14] DoubleNova: the hardest difficulty you reset the dungeon on wipe

[3:23:15] mmo_kenna_: FF14 getting chilled farming island too right?
[3:23:18] ShadoodHD: even better, in harder dungeon they won't allow res and mobs will respawn if the party wiped
[3:23:21] Nachozdood: it was higher lvl versions of older dungeons
[3:24:23] Rudric_Ice: do we know where DF is on the map ?
[3:24:36] abracka_: also pretty excited for that stardew valley in XIV with the island sanctuary
[3:25:25] PToastman: eh im trying to be cautious about that island sanctuary I am getting some guildhest vibes lol
[3:25:42] mmo_kenna_: yeah solo farming island, crops and animals
[3:25:42] Moobot: Plans for WOTLK Beta. Some simple leveling and helping Blizzard test. At first there won't be a lot of people to do content with. That will change when 80 Template comes into play. OH and I don't have Beta keys ask Panda
[3:25:44] HeyitsMega: no theyll be new dungeons entierly
[3:25:49] ShadoodHD: usually gathering and build-making facilities like stardew, and it's pretty huge island
[3:25:53] DoubleNova: brand new
[3:26:18] abracka_: https://www.pcgamesn.com/final-fantasy-xiv-a-realm-reborn/island-sanctuary-live-letter-71
[3:26:24] abracka_: some info on the island sanctuary
[3:26:45] amkttv: double seals in wrath? hype
[3:26:54] dracullus: so they introduce mythic dungeons in 6.2 just like wow? xD
[3:27:07] George2001k: @towelliee any idea when we will be able to play around with the new talent trees ourselves?
[3:27:09] PhillyDilly18: 60% of the time it works every time
[3:27:17] abracka_: @dracullus sorta kinda? seems like they're making their own spin/version of it though
[3:27:41] DoubleNova: they aren't like mythic they are just harder difficulty

[3:31:15] mmo_kenna_: I don't mind diablo immortal personally, I play co-op with my wife we do the battle pass and have fun with it
[3:32:29] Rudric_Ice: so blizzard finally might explore whats east of eastern kindoms thats what they said in the FAQ
[3:33:14] stratiss: my DI server kinda died, I hope they open up transfers
[3:33:37] Lythoraxx: hey, just curious, do you think blizz is kinda "monitoring" or checking your streams too while playing ?
[3:33:59] stratiss: that too
[3:34:24] abracka_: kind of the main reason i stopped playing
[3:34:50] Mattsta: yeah, i stopped playing when it stopped letting me just play it solo
[3:35:07] Rudric_Ice: played immortal till lvl 40 got bored

[3:36:40] ClassicMalcontent: @Rudric_Ice perhaps. The interesting point is DF cinematic showed the island looking towards the main whirlpool/whirlwind scar of Azeroth 10k years ago. As if it would be 'yet another island / continent' around it. They could put it wherever of course.
[3:36:40] Aquadriel: 7th
[3:36:49] Aquadriel: the 7 of july
[3:37:29] mmo_kenna_: Netease make good games, they just ruin them with auto-pay and over monetisation. I'm playing their BR on Xbox atm called Naraka
[3:38:19] Blah206: amen
[3:38:41] George2001k: @towelliee just finished playing around with the Holy Priest talents. That shit is fun and strong… hope all the trees are the same.

[4:46:45] Nachozdood: didnt they say they were going to make 10 and 25 share the same lockouts cause they didnt want peeps running the same raid 4 times a week
[4:46:58] sh4d0wsky: yeah
[4:47:05] sh4d0wsky: they spoke up about somethin like that before
[4:47:18] Siegfriedpencil: wrath is good because its not overcomplicated

[4:48:32] king_julian_96: what's your thoughts on the preist talents in dragonflight
[4:48:35] stratiss: I think the question becomes, would mythic raid participation increase if it was 10 man.
[4:48:43] Inzidious: tbh just remove normal mode
[4:48:46] Jeff_dd: yup
[4:48:47] sh4d0wsky: probably
[4:48:49] Densetsu_: I would like 10man again
[4:48:51] Rayman_1990: @silentdark32 Dont raids usually use master looter tho ?
[4:48:52] Nico_vdM: Some bosses are tuned for more people. Doing it with 10 people makes it a bit harder.
[4:48:53] sh4d0wsky: 10 man mythic BloodTrail
[4:48:59] AveragePvp: @Jollywhompus facts
[4:49:06] PoppaWoody: Wrath brings back so many memories of taking a week off school to hit 80 in two days....
[4:49:06] CaseysOn: Can you tri-spec dual wield tank as a DK in wotlk like you could when it was retail?

[4:49:49] dabedaaa: Wait so wotlk classic is coming out soon?
[4:50:00] Rayman_1990: @CaseysOn iirc all weird op dk tanking specs were nerfed and during the last patch blood was pretty much only tanking spec, but I can be wrong
[4:50:10] king_julian_96: what's your thoughts on the preist talents in dragonflight towelliee
[4:50:10] cleartrauma: transmog was in wrath? I dont even remember

[4:50:29] Jollywhompus: Priest, thats not a tank class
[4:50:30] Nico_vdM: I think transmog was MoP
[4:50:40] cleartrauma: ah okay
[4:50:44] silentdark32: @Rayman_1990 There was master looter, but there's a way after boss fights that a raid member would leave the group and loot the loot chests taking all the loot.  Not sure exactly how it was done though
[4:50:52] ENDURANCEx: PI?
[4:50:54] Korupcija_: I had to unfollow him, he makes me mad KEKW

[5:45:17] fierystar88: @neugassh  @aravarth No DF for vanilla and TBC is fine. Not having it for wrath makes no sense.
[5:45:21] DragonofWolves: Yeah people are pissed about AX because they let it get filled beyond capacity. Like that made me nervous just looking at that line to get in.
[5:45:25] MrGattz: why would you not want it??
[5:45:31] jaina8675309: they should to both
[5:45:36] MrGattz: its the best thing to happen to mmos since sliced bread
[5:45:42] AveragePvp: @MrGattz thats the question ive been asking myself since they said they werent gonna do it
[5:45:43] JoeyBagadonuts: Esfand told them
[5:45:44] bubonicblade: I think players complained saying that the instant teleport to the dungeon is what ruined the game.
[5:45:50] VictorLowes: @Aravarth new players are gonna get boxed out in a few weeks of launch
[5:45:50] Rayman_1990: wasnt raid finder introduced at the end of wrath too ? do you guys want raid finder too ? Kappa
[5:45:53] UmmNoU: I just want lfd when Im leveling alts. It's my favorite way to level them
[5:45:54] fierystar88: I get the feeling they will eventually add in the dungeon finder. Definitely not at the start it would seem
[5:45:57] Gillrad: People complain about LFD tool, then use an addon that does the same exact thing only worse
[5:45:59] MrGattz: they dont have lfd then its just dead
[5:46:07] Jollywhompus: Are we sure this is a player focused choice and not them just trying to manage dev cost for whatever version they originally designed
[5:46:13] wyman1990vc: they underestimate how toxic players are
[5:46:14] ShadoodHD: i mean seriously where the hell do they get their feedback? 4chan???
[5:46:22] Thanatocracy: Instant teleport to dungeon totally killed WoW guys come on Kappa
[5:46:36] Cosmolus: it's always the tips KEKW
[5:46:55] Rayman_1990: most of wotlk was without group finder
[5:46:59] SlamzandGramz: the feedback they get is from them obv LUL
[5:47:26] Daveybutter: @towelliee Blizz: "Don't you guys have friends?"

[5:47:41] KombatWombat07: people complaining about lfd in wrath would still play it anyway

[5:48:00] MrGattz: it*
[5:48:15] neugassh: who cries about it will quit either way before ulduar hit
[5:48:26] iloveyalunn: Guys... WoW token ruined WoW, now excuse me as i buy $1000 from this girl named Susan. Kappa
[5:48:45] SlamzandGramz: going into a global channel to find players for a raid was hell if you didnt have a set raid team/guild
[5:48:45] Lightninghandz: Started playing WoW in 2020, never got to play wrath. LFD is what hooked me and my friends, being able to do dungeons and not just quest while leveling was huge.
[5:49:18] Nachozdood: i feel like they are just using the no LFD thing as a see told you so cause a ton of the wow community says that lfd and lfr killed the community and wow as a whole
[5:49:40] Rayman_1990: @Lightninghandz but what stop you from doing dungeons without lfd ?
[5:49:52] rick_morks: np hp no mana F
[5:50:15] Lightninghandz: @Rayman_1990 WoW is such a huge world, we would have never known dungeons even exist without another player or LFD
[5:50:39] nouwandhi: Is this classic?
[5:50:39] SlamzandGramz: @Lightninghandz having to run all the way to the dungeon itself before lfd was a thing
[5:50:54] neugassh: @Lightninghandz KEKW
[5:51:16] Rayman_1990: @Lightninghandz well the huge world is one the point of the game isnt it, dungeon is the zone in some part of the world, not some abstract zone
[5:51:16] bubonicblade: And a lot of players felt like that is what ruined the game, that's probably why they took it out is all

[5:51:24] sh4d0wsky: LUL
[5:51:27] Lightninghandz: @SlamzandGramz As soon as questing and leveling is done in retail WoW, you move to mythic. Where you have to walk to dungeons I understand this lol.
[5:51:27] bubonicblade: I'm not saying it was a good idea, but there was a massive voice of people that didn't like it
[5:51:33] iloveyalunn: Muh experience! LUL
[5:51:33] kingliar: y exaactly same as with leveling a new char in retail, chill questing until you get a dung
[5:51:55] azurrei: I did at least 10x more dungeons once LFD was added - rarely did any dungeons on alts then were spending hours every day gearing them up in the ICC patch dungeons
[5:51:56] Aquadriel: so much for you think you do but you dont KEKW
[5:52:10] neugassh: people would just sit in og or sw and spam dungeons
[5:52:22] SlamzandGramz: @Lightninghandz i dont think you do understand. before LFG and even mythic being a thing you had to go to that dungeon
[5:52:25] iloveyalunn: TFW you realize everyone really just hated leveling

[5:53:29] Kyrrua: leveling + server start is real fun
[5:53:40] SlamzandGramz: @Lightninghandz in wrath all the people who wanted to farm FOS/POS literally stood outside the portals to find groups. there was no LFD
[5:53:41] Lightninghandz: @SlamzandGramz So what are you saying that is different than I am saying, Did you walk differently to a dungeon than I do to mythic? numlock work differently back then? lol
[5:53:52] Thoreya: wtf
[5:53:54] Thoreya: lol
[5:53:55] jess_sing0801: what.even.
[5:54:40] SlamzandGramz: @Lightninghandz bro im not even talking about mythic lmao
[5:54:44] Lightninghandz: @SlamzandGramz Are you upset that people chose to sit outside the dungeon they wanted to run? It still the same today, people who are running NW for example for the mount just sit outside and run it over and over
[5:55:16] Lightninghandz: @SlamzandGramz Thats your mistake, there is no difference from mythic or any dungeons. LFG is only used for leveling to get to max level content.
[5:55:24] Rayman_1990: while leveling, character feels so powerful. Then you hit max level and get smacked in both pvp and pve cos of being undergeared Kappa
[5:55:27] ZumaKatos: What is your all time favorite wow expansion?
[5:55:44] Lightninghandz: @SlamzandGramz Walking to a dungeon is walking to a dungeon.

[6:09:59] tyler2tall89: cata was boring
[6:10:03] Aravarth: I *loved* the difficulty of Cata dungeons
[6:10:03] beernear31: cata dungeons were awesome
[6:10:16] RagingPunk: cata was fun
[6:10:18] Sufix: i love how hard the dungeons are at the start of an expansion
[6:10:26] Cyrukh: cata destroyed most classes for me like ret with holy power and dks mostly unholy not playing on diseases anymore
[6:10:34] azurrei: I remember spending 3 hours in Deadmines heroic in cata on launch, good times
[6:10:36] ArcaneSyntax: I mean it's not just that they were hard, there were hard heroics at the end of wrath
[6:10:48] ArcaneSyntax: it's that they were LONG and hard.
[6:10:55] tyler2tall89: I just didnt enjoy the Cata lore
[6:11:01] Diamondead1: they werent hard at the end
[6:11:05] mavericks312: nothing about wrath heroics were hard lol
[6:11:06] tyler2tall89: it wasnt the difficult dungeons
[6:11:08] Cyrukh: todays uh dk feels like all you do is pop pimples on enemies.. diseases were awesome
[6:11:17] Bruzzi: i always enjoyed that dungeon in Dalaran
[6:11:24] Ryathael: Hell, not that long after the ICC dungeons came out, we were rolling through them like the other Heroics in Wrath.
[6:11:31] Sh4nti: Halls of reflection was just so scripted so much waiting
[6:11:36] RagingPunk: nerf paladins :P
[6:12:59] ArcaneSyntax: They were pretty rough with randos at launch
[6:12:59] Cyrukh: pit was easiest of those 3
[6:13:23] Ryathael: Yea, I LOVED the launch Cata dungeons.
[6:13:33] ArcaneSyntax: I think the length of cata dungeons is the bigger issue than the difficulty.
[6:14:05] Diamondead1: i loved leveling in storm peaks
[6:14:05] Moobot: 🐲 S4 WILL NOT BE LAUNCHING WITH 9.2.5! It will be here later this Summer probably after the MDI/AWC Finals. 🐲
[6:14:07] Aravarth: I didn't find them any longer than Wrath dungeons, they just felt "long" because they were hard
[6:14:27] mavericks312: hardest part of pit was the gauntlet
[6:14:32] ArcaneSyntax: Pit and Halls weren't that long, even with shit gear, but cata heroics took so long to do.
[6:14:39] Diamondead1: WAZAA
[6:15:17] Cyrukh: cata had annoying dungeons like the underground temple with lasers and tolvir

[6:31:16] chubahi: i think its fine

[6:31:46] TheCliffyShow: Some people just want to watch the World of Warcraft burn.
[6:31:48] R2RHIN0: I like PI, I love being able to boost an allies performance.
[6:31:48] iloveyalunn: PI is the reason the dinosaurs went extinct  Kappa
[6:31:53] grimmy17: You have no idea the drama that arises around PI
[6:31:55] Nachozdood: Dear Blizzard.....why are all the kicks and silences a talent choice and not base
[6:32:00] grimmy17: Keep it on priests sure
[6:32:07] grimmy17: Get rid of the cast on someone else though
[6:32:10] grimmy17: That shit is heinous
[6:32:12] SoulToned: pretty toxic ability
[6:32:17] mavericks312: I can see them make mages choose between icy veins and mirror images lol

[6:32:32] iloveyalunn: Shadow priest looking so sick, i cant wait
[6:32:37] vic_ave: dispels
[6:32:47] almostdps: I just hate the whole PI argument of "external cds are bad"... in that case BL/Hero needs to go too
[6:32:49] warrenny: Make arcane torrent silence again
[6:32:49] Kize_Gaming: @Towelliee Hey do you currently have dual spec ? If you do, are you able to change specs when you are not in a rested place ?
[6:32:52] MrGharr: they should replace PI with interrupt in the tree
[6:32:56] alalonso89: Solution. Give PI as a passive that is always enabled to all players. Kappa
[6:33:00] KombatWombat07: inc tricks of trade drama again
[6:33:01] zaid57: im out of the loop, did they remove PI?
[6:33:04] NEMERL: Its stupid they are taking sooo much from defoult Druids abilities and put them to the tree
[6:33:04] SoulToned: bloodlust isnt single target...
[6:33:09] grimmy17: @almostdps giving the raid bloodlust vs 1 person PI is totally different
[6:33:14] Rottencoarse: @zaid57  nah
[6:33:17] chubahi: fuck no
[6:33:27] Cyrukh: the thing with talents is that you HAVE to put in certain points to get to the lower rows
[6:33:36] warrenny: @zaid57 Not yet
[6:33:40] Cyrukh: try out the calculator on wowhead
[6:33:42] MrGharr: Or keep PI self only, with talent giving 5/10% haste partywide while active.
[6:33:43] hateful88: Caring about classic parsing is like a 30yr flexing on stomping kids in the special olympics
[6:33:48] grimmy17: @zaid57 we're hoping :P
[6:34:01] TheCliffyShow: I wanna see what they do with Rogue's kick, the original go to interupt.
[6:34:08] warrenny: Make hunter lust base
[6:34:13] Akuka_: I just don't like that things that have been baseline for 10 years or more in some cases are in there. Talent trees should enhance not make me prune myself
[6:34:15] warrenny: Not require pet for mm
[6:34:22] Oceansevan: just casually explode a mammoth rooKek
[6:34:30] RagingPunk: THEY SPINNIN
[6:34:36] grimmy17: I was kinda hoping they would put the classic priest racials into the tree :(
[6:34:38] NEMERL: @Towelliee now ppl dont use interrupts and now i DF xpac imagine they are not taking this talent cuz they dont use interrputs anyway xD
[6:34:39] grimmy17: Fear ward when
[6:34:48] MrGharr: Hunters should get a talent that reads as "Fixes all Pet related bugs"
[6:34:55] Sayryn: BOOOOOONSTORM
[6:35:06] Cyrukh: sv hunters should get dw, ascension has a project going on with custom classes and they have a ranger melee class with 2h and dw and it looks good
[6:35:26] WoWRoach: I like not having them baseline. I will use a build with max dps and no utility when questing.  Maybe grab an interrupt for dungeons.
[6:36:12] dylan_cabs: how was leveling port vs ret
[6:36:13] wEiRdO_dUdE: Don't prune me, bro
[6:36:14] grimmy17: Yeah that's the scary part when they said "people can make bad builds"
[6:36:15] grimmy17: Spooky
[6:36:53] srs_business: People have always been able to make bad builds, that isn't new
[6:36:56] MrGharr: you can skip holy nova in class tree, then pick up holy nova enhancer talents in the spec tree.
[6:37:03] RagingPunk: are they adding a quest helper at all
[6:37:09] dylan_cabs: wait wtf how are you flying
[6:37:18] WoWRoach: Yes, quest helper will be back

[6:44:49] user11214: @Cyrukh it was like that in tbc
[6:45:07] notColt45: professions will be rough

[6:45:16] Cyrukh: but not for dailies @nks100
[6:45:16] notColt45: mats will be sparce
[6:45:23] Kize_Gaming: Mining skin or herb skin

[6:47:37] notColt45: But gold won't do much when there aren't mats to buy and put on AH haha
[6:47:46] notColt45: for profs anyway
[6:47:47] Cyrukh: also you can make ALOT of raw gold from killing those scarlet soldiers and priests on the onslaught island in icecrown

[7:19:20] HaxzorJimDuggan: a warrior bought one for a shit ton
[7:19:22] notColt45: The first one went for 350k right?
[7:19:23] Cyrukh: one of the first thoridal went for 200k i believe there was a vid
[7:19:24] Kinghorn: dropped in guzu's pug yesterday
[7:19:27] Srgskug: 350k first week
[7:19:27] wreckshoptv: 155k
[7:19:31] Lifestream7: Its crazy some people in my guild run sunwell like 6 times a week on different toons along with hyjal and black temple 6 times
[7:19:33] jaalexba: @QuaalityTV Play for an hour on a trial account and you'll probably just get it out of your system for free :)
[7:20:07] notColt45: Yeah my guild does GDKP. That's their gold making haha
[7:20:15] Cyrukh: tbh the guy that spend 200k for the kt sword in classic was crazier 200k in classic is waaay more than the 350k in tbc
[7:21:04] Kyrrua: feelsRMTman
[7:21:16] jkitchin75: whats gdkp?
[7:21:16] Moobot: bgod2500, Just for the time being we will be automatically removing any "Pay to Win" comments regardless of context to clean up chat while we play Lost Ark. Sorry for the inconvenience!
[7:21:41] Tylerjorden: help im stuck in the snow!
[7:21:45] Kyrrua: @jkitchin75 you cannot know if ur not rich
[7:21:50] Kyrrua: Kappa
[7:21:54] Cyrukh: you swipe for loot
[7:22:02] bgod2500: gdkp makes the game pRay to win
[7:22:16] notColt45: Gold dragon kill points. It using your DKP but it's gold instead
[7:22:20] chexmixz: its gold bid for loot
[7:22:31] Cyrukh: yes we dont do that Kappa
[7:22:32] almostdps: gdkp is just a bid system for pugs, for guilds if you bought dkp via donating gold to the guild or something it would make sense
[7:22:39] Kinghorn: someone bought the gold somewhere along the line
[7:22:57] HaxzorJimDuggan: gold buyer punishment needs to be much harsher, perma ban first offense
[7:23:04] Cyrukh: there are tokens on asia servers if i recall
[7:23:15] notColt45: I'm sure they weight hte cost benefit of it haha
[7:23:16] nocturnal_2195: @jkitchin75 nowadays gdkp tldr is basically  bidding on raid items for gold
[7:23:57] iloveyalunn: Kinda weird that the classic community is against the token when most of them just RMT from gold seller websites or exchange gold from retail to classic via discords
[7:24:12] Cyrukh: i would say havocs call hc is better
[7:24:30] SNaKEBOI: addon usually ends it 15s after the last bid
[7:24:30] NotMitchShelton: GDKP run?
[7:24:37] Cyrukh: some take a 10% cut
[7:24:40] Kinghorn: -tank cuts
[7:24:42] jaalexba: Yoker
[7:24:45] Kinghorn: etc
[7:24:46] wEiRdO_dUdE: It's not evenly split, but they do split it up
[7:24:50] WoWRoach: Top DPS gets a little more
[7:24:55] Robsnow_901: most runs take 10% for tanks and the organizer and shit
[7:24:57] Kyrrua: give cut to healrs
[7:24:59] Nico_vdM: gdkp was how I could afford consumables and repairs
[7:25:01] Kyrrua: hearlers*
[7:25:02] Lifestream7: I usually see 10% host cut and tank cuts and every now and then top healer / dps cut
[7:25:08] Poriand: idk how people have that kinda gold in classic. all seems BS
[7:25:12] Kale_Nd: performance based
[7:25:20] wEiRdO_dUdE: These days they do "performance based" cuts
[7:25:26] Cyrukh: never saw performance based cuts only 95/5 or 90/10 runs
[7:25:26] notColt45: Depends how current the content is. Usuall older stuff is just split between entire raid or non-buyers
[7:25:31] bgod2500: the classic community has honestly made the game the most far from the classic experience ive ever seen... its swipe to win GDKP's with little to no community outside of the people who lead the gdkps
[7:25:40] iloveyalunn: @Poriand It is lol
[7:25:43] Cyrukh: buyers that dont bid just get removed and get no cut
[7:25:44] bgod2500: at least on faerlina
[7:25:47] wEiRdO_dUdE: So some of the sleazy dps guys will pay healers not to heal other dps guys so that they can get the top spot and a larger cut

[7:25:58] NotMitchShelton: i remember the GDKP runs on Zul Jin during wrath
[7:26:02] Kyrrua: you're still gated by gold no matter if ur good or not tho
[7:26:05] Zerfell: Made so much gold with GDKP TOGC
[7:26:06] NotMitchShelton: brings back memories
[7:26:39] NotMitchShelton: @zerfell I made a killing in ICC
[7:26:46] yepman9: tanks got bonus for their alt runs when i did gdkp
[7:26:46] toobaked1987: Based on performance? It was based on heaviest pockest back in the start of GDKP.
[7:27:04] Cyrukh: gkdp was always a retail thing tho i played plenty privates and nobody does gdkp there
[7:27:30] Zerfell: Yeah that and selling proto drake runs in Ulduar
[7:27:33] Robsnow_901: runs still need some good carrys or u cant kill anything lol
[7:27:35] toobaked1987: "Can we hurry up and get to saurfang? Time to get paid"
[7:27:41] wEiRdO_dUdE: Yeah the GDKP's are crazy goblin things now
