[3:34:48] TheLadyCupcake: Graycen,  a notorious con artist, tricked a group of viewers into investing their life savings in a fake cooking stream with Ang scheme. When caught, Graycen showed no remorse and callously laughed in the face of his victims. Enraged by his heartless actions, one of the viewers landed a powerful punch square in Graycen's liver, causing him to double over in pain and finally face the consequences of his cruel scam.
