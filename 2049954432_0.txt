[0:20:15] ApolloRache: Is not wow the biggest MMO that exist?
[0:20:36] thunduz: and call of duty zombies
[0:21:31] Salfriel: who dis?
[0:21:59] GuildChatter: WoW killer = Microsoft?
[0:22:53] Midgens_: they waited until they came back from an event to tell them
[0:23:42] PidiaP: I think for the other games they just hire the casters all event by event so might do the same with Overwatch
[0:23:49] zebercetanayurt: bizarre severance
[0:24:39] Sarkans41: Blizzard is a business first... people seem to forget.
[0:24:40] Synkronos: OMG that majestic hair! Sorry, I'm sure you're a lovely person and not trying to objectify, but dayum
[0:25:23] GuildChatter: Safety school  =P
[0:25:26] Valestrus: PRINCETON
[0:26:11] Mascot16: are they going to try and make WoW an E-sport again?
[0:26:18] PidiaP: Do you think she will be a victim of the glass cliff phenomenon where she’s going to be the fall girl for something bad like the original co-leader that was there with Ybarra?
[0:26:56] Syzmical: who is mr garret wiensnitzel
[0:27:06] Syzmical: any chatters know
[0:27:36] Sarkans41: mergers always lead to layoffs...
[0:27:54] MillyLynn: @syzmical he used to co-host a podcast with Tali called WoWKiller
[0:28:11] PidiaP: It’s also the share holder thing of, well our competitors did it so we need to do it too
[0:28:36] Syzmical: ty milly, still unfamiliar but ty (:
[0:28:42] Salfriel: who is this guy?
[0:28:58] Syzmical: @Salfriel see millys comment just a few up
[0:29:22] Salfriel: ah so he's a content creator?
[0:30:08] MillyLynn: @salfriel yeah, it sounds like he's making content about Final Fantasy now
[0:30:30] Salfriel: ty for the ino
[0:30:43] Nulgar: Arthas died in WotLK, and his soul was likely ripped apart immediately upon arriving in the Maw. That sliver in the cinematic was the equivalent of a finger bone. That wasn't Arthas, hadn't been for years.
[0:31:53] echoofnuuri: Garrett! I remember waking up and opening wow killer during the pandemic (was in US at the time, so it was AM for me). Good to see you all on the podcast! <3
[0:33:49] Mascot16: its the whole, "fool me once" trick. :D
[0:33:52] cenwenki: LUL
[0:38:26] Syzmical: fair take
[0:38:54] gurkenglashalbvoll: on the other hand, the Broken Isles felt like a theme park, way too heterogenous
[0:39:18] StoneFaceWoW: DF dungeons are the weakest of all time for sure
[0:43:10] Mascot16: the last boyscouts?
[0:45:24] Rhys_Velaris: There are too many "main characters" now
[0:46:11] Arkavien: It's the Avengers issue.  Every solo title if the threat is big there is always the "ok but where are the avengers?"
[0:46:36] darth_nykal: tuskars!!
[0:46:41] ivashkov92: Yea, they weren’t used or developed much so they were just these NPC “heroes” so imo its so much better with all these actual lore figures having a more prominent interaction in the world
[0:47:10] Rhys_Velaris: And then the threat is too big, the avengers get their buts kicked and a new "main character" is introduced.
[0:48:39] darth_nykal: "Raiding" in SoD has been aweful
[0:50:11] FeikaNovi: i agree, was hoping for a classic challenge and got a "one difficulty oneshot raid" :(
[0:51:08] darth_nykal: @FeikaNovi Not even that. If you were healing and weren't a priest, you were simply playing the wrong class. If you were a dps and werent a rogue or hunter, you were simply playing the wrong class. There was no inbetween
[0:51:59] darth_nykal: Oh, tanking as a lock? enjoy the raid boss with 70% shadow-resist
[0:53:47] zebercetanayurt: so much content in the vanilla world that normally I rushed through. now stopping and enjoying is great.
[0:54:06] FeikaNovi: @darth_nykal caster dps was really underpowered, healer i guess its the despell missing? i have done the raid only twice once on priest and once on rogue so i dont really know anything about the meta.  But with the content being so easy i guess it doesnt matter what you play?
[0:54:17] ivashkov92: They’re not the same game honestly. they feel a lot different
[0:55:13] darth_nykal: @FeikaNovi The healer issue is the priest glyphs for PoM and Penance. They're SO powerful and dirt cheap, its a detriment to bring a non-priest
[0:55:52] FeikaNovi: @darth_nykal haha yeah i recognized that when playing priest that they didnt tune the mana costs right ^^
[0:56:35] FeikaNovi: i thought all healers got the runes like that
[0:57:21] Syzmical: OSRS is pinultimate not overwriting your existing game
[0:58:06] Syzmical: you constantly visit the village you SPAWNED in for multitudes, look at that title for guidance
[0:58:39] Nulgar: it's not even easier, it's mandatory tneEvi
[0:59:26] darth_nykal: It's disingenuous to say "if you want to" in XIV, you have no choice but to play through EVERYTHING from 10+years to catch up
[1:00:04] Morrido: ugh, that's aggressive
[1:00:17] Nulgar: to be fair, you won't level quickly from 60 to 61 in pre-DF content clodagHeheheh
[1:00:25] darth_nykal: @Morrido it's exhausting
[1:01:12] Morrido: ffxiv x wow crossover LUL LUL
[1:02:24] neverbornlucky: Taliesin great news. Blizzard decided palworld was such a success in order not to  lose more people like diablo dev team they will use AI like palworld and can make wow a better game
[1:02:34] Morrido: they would need to do faster progress, I guess
[1:03:11] the_howlermonkey: the idea of EXPANDING on the old storylines on the classic servers, and building it out like they wanted to originally sounds amazing to me
[1:03:19] Dathas487: I feel like SoD IS classic plus, it just allows them to develop in drip content form which I imagine is easier in terms of pacing and budget.
[1:03:59] Morrido: oooh
[1:04:04] the_howlermonkey: i thin the drip style content of SOD is 100% an experiment to see how it goes, because it is their plan for doing live content going forward.
[1:04:10] darth_nykal: the removed panda lego storyline
[1:04:16] Morrido: DoubleAgent yes
[1:04:33] Kainiee: hes the ultra vegan
[1:05:04] cinnatoasto_: What was Evi's big secret?
[1:05:19] Cooperharley0204: KEKW
[1:05:26] Gaming_Mama56: Glad I checked in. Heya Garrett.. love the doo.
[1:05:50] Brewmaster_Holsten: I quit right before the end of Stormblood because I didn't want to lose the sprout-icon x247puEyes
[1:06:10] Morrido: @Brewmaster_Holsten you can be a sprout up to shb now
[1:07:08] Brewmaster_Holsten: @Morrido good to know, thanks. will probably jump back in once the graphical updates roll in
[1:08:01] darth_nykal: unpopular opinion: Shadowbringers is overrated AF and people are just horny for Emet-Selch
[1:08:45] Morrido: @Brewmaster_Holsten double-check, but I think every previous xpac is sprout safe
[1:08:49] databob1: I just finished a film reborn last night  the storytelling to get us into hevesnsword was crap
[1:09:32] kikisume: ff14 is so fun. excited to get back into it
[1:09:54] the_howlermonkey: they need to stop it with rolling out new cities on evey expac, that just get vacated at the end
[1:10:43] darth_nykal: wait, you don't want to play 2 years to get the whole story? but you just praised 14 for making you play 10 years worth of story to get he whole story? sigh back to "wow bad 14 good"
[1:10:53] Morrido: wow really needs to be revisiting old content more often, to keep the world somewhat updated. I still remember the warchief shuffle dance tho
[1:11:00] neverbornlucky: Taliesin thanks to this month tradingpost you can transmog as sailor moon in wow . Get your Sailor Scout on
[1:13:25] jmalmin: Oh! the trading post... I am at work and i can not check it! Someone get me a taxi!
[1:13:38] darth_nykal: Star Wars sequel trilogy has entered the chat
[1:13:53] Brewmaster_Holsten: @darth_nykal "I am all the titans"!"
[1:14:07] jmalmin: World soul saga will rip the world apart. and somehow rebuild it some of it when the saga comes to a end.
[1:14:22] vandis1022: Omg the flare
[1:14:46] darth_nykal: @Brewmaster_Holsten "The titans returned... somehow"
[1:15:57] ivashkov92: Ya, their marketing team absolutely killed it for BFA
[1:15:57] darth_nykal: Ok but lets not pretend 14's random bird-girl big bad introduced in the second to last zone was planned from the beginning.
[1:16:33] ivashkov92: it was super hyper off of the backbone of Legion and I remember how awesome the story quest built up over those few weeks of pre-patch was so awesome
[1:16:33] Brewmaster_Holsten: remember when we all made our shoulderpads invisible after the Saurfang-cinematic dropped?
[1:17:41] zaria32vath: Ok but so many people love the prequels now
[1:18:11] Tarrot469: @darth_nykal she wasn't planned out from the start, but one of the job quests from either ARR or Heavensward for Bard reference bird girl's song of oblivion, so some ideas were already there
[1:19:13] Arkavien: becasue the target audience, the kids who it was intended for....grew up and now posts on the internet that they loved it
[1:20:28] Alonarius: @arkavien and the haters would rather be in with the crowd than stick to their guns about it
[1:21:20] Tazzad: WoW didnt know James McAvoy played wow
[1:21:29] Morrido: except Endwalker, where it ends in 6, 6.1-4 is a setup for the future and 6.5 is the intro for the next xpac
[1:21:30] R0kus: Woaaah Garrett!! Good to see him here.
[1:21:43] zaria32vath: to be fair I was too young to see episode 1 or 2 in theaters.  I just watched them through home video growing up and the clone wars series lolz
[1:22:16] Arkavien: @Alonarius and in my case....I grew up and just don't hate thisgs as much as I used to lol
[1:22:54] thunduz: credit roll fits wow so nicely
[1:23:28] ivashkov92: Agreed
[1:23:51] thunduz: and they literally have a credit roll in the login screen so I would assume it wouldn't be difficult to just pop into ingame
[1:24:48] pegseleven: is this podcast on an audio form? love a good wow podcast :)
[1:24:58] atamala: @pegseleven yeah it is
[1:25:07] pegseleven: awesome what’s it called?
[1:25:14] Voric_: Who shot J.R. was the biggest cliffhanger, and that was early 80s
[1:25:17] thunduz: @pegseleven yes this is their podcast "A WoW Podcast, obviously
[1:25:17] atamala: @pegseleven a WoW Podcast, Obviously
[1:25:38] Johntriboltah: Echo on garrett?
[1:25:49] pegseleven: fair play
[1:26:13] thunduz: it's because Garrett is so divine his voice echoes. no way to avoid it
[1:26:32] Syzmical: rip steve
[1:26:50] darth_nykal: love the ignoring of 14's ending every minor patch with a post-credit scene cliffhanger LUL
[1:27:16] thunduz: but Destiny 2 is doing a Mass Effect collab so does story really matter right now?
[1:28:25] goatviolence: goatviolence subscribed with Prime. 
[1:29:27] ivashkov92: So no 10.2.6 news yet?
[1:29:42] trane472: KEKW
[1:29:45] thunduz: tneEvi tneEvi tneEvi
[1:30:07] thunduz: Kyle's ears perked up
[1:30:12] databob1: Without giving anything away the end of a relm reborn  was on rails they should have let u s fight it out more even if we ended up in the same place it felt bad.
[1:30:30] Blacksmith3989: @ivashkov92 Wouldn't be for another few hours at least, usually around 9am/10am Pacific time
[1:30:37] thunduz: love my trading post

[1:32:18] GuildChatter: RAF mount = 100 tenders now
[1:32:20] alextheblight: first time in months I've dipped beneath 1k tendies at once
[1:32:25] liveshowfieldy: oh wtf, I had to recruit a friend for 3 months to get that
[1:32:41] Blacksmith3989: I've had that rocket for so long. The joys of dropping friends off it back in the day
[1:33:06] ivashkov92: lmao
[1:33:08] Nulgar: sadly only Human models, random gender each use
[1:33:10] kikisume: we need more 2+ mounts in wow
[1:33:22] alextheblight: @Nulgar I got a fem smorc
[1:33:33] Morrido: LUL
[1:33:41] Nulgar: @alextheblight are you Horde? Maybe it at least considers faction
[1:33:47] Blacksmith3989: @kikisume We need a carriage mount that holds at least 4 players and a driver
[1:34:04] Twebbles_: And yet the moogle event gives plenty of in game stuff every patch cycle
[1:34:09] Morrido: store in 14 is big and really hard to spend money on
[1:34:10] alextheblight: @Nulgar yeh
[1:34:11] KaosDevice: @Blacksmith3989 that would rule.
[1:34:18] kikisume: @Blacksmith3989 that would be amazing
[1:34:32] grimblymcgoo: @Blacksmith3989 how about a squid?

[1:35:03] cabeshpash: tendies = chicken tenders
[1:35:08] darth_nykal: its the EXACT same as the 14 moogle tomes event.
[1:35:11] Morrido: there's one particular emote that they added to the store that I wanted to kill them for doing it
[1:35:32] brennibrennt: Those last ditch efforts saved my ass yesterday. Had done nothing the whole month :D
[1:36:56] Nulgar: the red bug might be the first pet I buy on the TP
[1:37:39] Rhys_Velaris: Sailor moon vibes

[1:44:15] MrVahete: MrVahete subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 16 months! 
[1:44:20] neverbornlucky: Garrett How goes the high chairs?
[1:44:27] Nulgar: FF14 races are like Alliance races, but even more boring *hides*
[1:44:33] Saiyori: Viera can wear some hats
[1:44:44] Morrido: Roe
[1:44:47] thunduz: Roe
[1:45:12] thunduz: Thicc races only

[1:45:31] darth_nykal: @Nulgar  just humans, taller humans, shorter humans, and humans with cat/bunny ear headbands
[1:45:33] thunduz: 100%
[1:45:37] Wenlocke: Arguably, the system is better in wow, but the outfits ibn 14 are better
[1:45:39] Morrido: system is better, chests are worse, no dyes are a shame
[1:45:47] WynneTheFox: Champions Online: Best char customization, not great at anything else
[1:45:47] Nulgar: I started Blade n Soul some years ago, played the Roe equivalent, can confirm
[1:45:47] Wenlocke: (what Tali said)
[1:46:05] neverbornlucky: Taliesn ask Garrett if they fixed the high chairs for the baby race
[1:46:09] alextheblight: dyes when, blizz
[1:46:10] Ionrage: I find most gear in FF14 just dress up and they don't do battle armour anymore, a lot of WoW gear is battle gear
[1:46:17] Morrido: WoW + 14 + Guild Wars
[1:46:21] darth_nykal: I just wish 14 added more traditionally fantasy looks
[1:46:23] Ionrage: Wow isn't made to look pretty but battled hardened
[1:46:32] ivashkov92: I love that dwarves tmog standing to the left…
[1:46:35] nimphtv: wow interface + ff14 quality of life stuff
[1:46:45] ivashkov92: What is that fur skirt she’s wearing!? =O
[1:46:50] thunduz: truth
[1:46:57] Wenlocke: 800/800 slots full
[1:46:59] WynneTheFox: Wow's feels frustrating, because the transmog feels like painted cardboard to me
[1:47:14] ancester: Is this a "wow killer" episode?
[1:47:19] ivashkov92: Yes
[1:47:22] Nulgar: I repeat that Transmog needs more slots: split "Head" into "Helm", "Face" = Glasses/Mask, "Neck" = Scarves/Monk Beads
[1:47:34] Morrido: @TaliesinAndEvitel you can send a support e-mail and they usually answer within a day
[1:47:45] Nulgar: and split "Back" into "Cloaks" and "Worn on Back" = 3D pieces
[1:47:46] Saiyori: @Nulgar y e s
[1:47:48] Atomicpanda: 12345
[1:48:05] neverbornlucky: Taliesin are we ignoring the high chairs in final fantasy ?
[1:48:13] ivashkov92: @nulgar Agreed though WoW has a bad clipping issue
[1:48:19] Morrido: just did some days ago, they gave me the answer to my secret question so I could reset it
[1:48:33] thunduz: DO IT!!!
[1:48:45] thunduz: Final Fantasy fridays return
[1:48:52] blumberquack: D: !
[1:48:52] Gaming_Mama56: youre square enix account is different from your FFXIV account, you log into that account o get your password.
[1:48:53] Morrido: parsing? no
[1:49:03] Ionrage: ff14 launcher just for its saved password is what battle net does anyways
[1:49:04] Morrido: dalamud is not a thing at all
[1:49:07] Morrido: never do it
[1:49:15] cenwenki: D:
[1:49:23] Ionrage: SE aren't competent devs
[1:49:25] Nulgar: just write down the password, it's not a bank account or work related
[1:49:41] thunduz: tneTaliDD tneTaliDD tneTaliDD
[1:49:42] cenwenki: LUL
[1:49:42] darth_nykal: wait you know charlie cox?
[1:49:44] Wenlocke: it's wales. its a really small country
[1:50:03] Nulgar: @darth_nykal yes
[1:50:10] alextheblight: everybody in Wales know each other
[1:50:26] Ionrage: hence all the smiths, Williams and jones
[1:50:39] Wenlocke: South Wales specifically is very "small town" even the cities
[1:50:47] Morrido: Aliseayeasie is great
[1:51:22] Quachiri: Was so sad that the sound was wasn't recorded for the vod of that phone call
[1:52:36] wowpricetag: where in wales?
[1:52:57] Nulgar: yes, you have to react exactly how the feels council has decided
[1:53:01] Wenlocke: #NotAcult
[1:53:20] darth_nykal: the worst part of 14 streamers are when they fake cry at specific parts
[1:53:45] Wenlocke: #NotAnEmotionalVampireCult
[1:53:51] Nulgar: I'm still tempted to start playing and streaming FF14, and just talk over dialog, skip cutscenes partway through, just anything that annoys watchers frogmu1Hehe
[1:54:15] Morrido: the big fat tacos episode for GG was tough to watch chat memeing
[1:54:24] Ionrage: its strange people say this because no one was crying during when HW for example was current. wonder where all of these cryers coming from
[1:54:51] Gaming_Mama56: EVI must finish FFXIV
[1:55:00] Ionrage: people get mad at me for being supportive of sylvanas
[1:55:07] Nulgar: but I get it, I watch a lot of Outer Wilds streams, and it's both great and weird to see people react differently, piece together the story differently
[1:55:41] alextheblight: true
[1:55:55] cabeshpash: what was in 9.1?
[1:56:00] Nulgar: @Ionrage hyperfans focus on _anything_ that sets 14 apart from WoW
[1:56:09] kikisume: @cabeshpash shandowlands
[1:56:10] Brewmaster_Holsten: i fucking loved Korthia, man. logging in to that bleak wasteland was so much fun
[1:56:30] Wenlocke: 9.1 broke my wow streak and I never went back (even though I tried) Dragonflight got my attention, but couldn;t keep my attention
[1:56:46] Ionrage: @Nulgar just wonder where they came from, been playing ff14 from 1.0 and just like they invaded the game
[1:56:59] the_howlermonkey: 9.1 was the super delayed patch for Shadowlands that did not add much too do.
[1:57:12] Morrido: I haven't played wow since BfA and I still have to watch them
[1:57:36] Nulgar: stop, Garrett, looking at Tali, this is about to become an NSFW stream
[1:57:52] darth_nykal: pour one out for biscuit
[2:00:31] Salfriel: i'm surprised people don't go where tali is sitting and stand behind him, trying to get into the screen and on the stream.
[2:00:54] mageyathink: wow is a family experience for us and many others that makes memories. there is nothing like having an eight year old trying to trade candy to you in the middle of a LK fight lol
[2:01:06] TownieTV: @Salfriel I have absolutely done this
[2:01:37] TownieTV: ingame, that is
[2:02:15] Salfriel: @TownieTV pfff, not impressed. come back when you break into his home and pop up next to the arcade while he's streaming.
[2:02:16] Darty12111: with big writing saying "Garrosh, back again?!"
[2:02:25] Nulgar: @Salfriel done that (with creative server hopping since Tali is on a low-pop RP realm) but one time, he kept the screen on the Twitter notifications, so I wrote a reply, something like "hi stream!" tneEvi
[2:02:42] Salfriel: @Nulgar low pop? it's Full.
[2:02:52] Nulgar: @Salfriel yeah for RP
[2:02:53] Nulgar: :p
[2:02:54] thunduz: noooooo this was such a good podcast I don't want to see it go
[2:03:01] ancester: TINKER
[2:03:23] snaxx23: Who is Garrett?
[2:03:35] ancester: a bud
[2:03:54] Salfriel: he has great hair and green eyes
[2:03:54] snaxx23: Significance?
[2:03:59] Salfriel: that's all you need to know.
[2:04:02] Saiyori: thats me with mop lol
[2:04:09] snaxx23: No needs a haircut lol
[2:04:17] thunduz: Garrett is another streamer who used to play WoW but left during Shadowlands. Him and Tali used to do a podcast called tneWowkiller
[2:04:27] onetoughkitty: @snaxx23 James McAvoy with blond hair
[2:04:37] snaxx23: @thunduz 😊 thank you
[2:04:46] thunduz: no the garrett mane shall not be touched!
[2:05:03] Nulgar: @onetoughkitty Charles X. Xavier before the whole telepathy thing
[2:05:04] neverbornlucky: The High Chairs
[2:05:04] snaxx23: SeemsGood
[2:05:11] blumberquack: Blasphemy D:
[2:05:13] thunduz: I wish it wasn't earthen
[2:05:20] blumberquack: but yeah earthen feels lame tbh
[2:05:25] ApolloRache: Keep ya feet on the grount
[2:05:25] onetoughkitty: @nulgar lol… still super sexy
[2:05:32] Synkronos: Naga! Snakemen!
[2:05:33] Saiyori: Sethrak! Arrakoa!
[2:05:33] darth_nykal: murlocs!!
[2:05:33] blumberquack: Give us arakkoa >:(
[2:05:33] thunduz: There's so many great options
[2:05:36] Larrith: Horde Dwarves.
[2:05:36] snaxx23: LUL
[2:05:40] Nulgar: now I'm gonna play Earthen even more :) clodagHorde
[2:05:54] mageyathink: I have always wanted a Murdock race that would use its flappy feet to slap mobs
[2:05:54] Darty12111: Orgre pls
[2:05:55] databob1: MURLOCKS!!
[2:05:55] MaharatD7: arrakoa, ethereals and ogres
[2:05:57] thunduz: there you go
[2:06:02] alextheblight: playable tuskarr 12,1 ez
[2:06:06] Darty12111: I wanna be a 2-headed Ogre mage.
[2:06:10] thunduz: would be so dope to play one of those
[2:06:11] Saiyori: they did mechagnomes
[2:06:13] Saiyori: they could do wraps
[2:06:15] darth_nykal: armor doesnt matter anymore. we have a race that cant even wear it
[2:06:17] Morrido: their body can still be foggy
[2:06:32] thunduz: the pose makes up for the wraps missing
[2:06:35] Arkavien: As a horde player, I feel like the only person excited for Earthen lol
[2:06:44] onetoughkitty: where’s our damn Tuskarr!?
[2:06:44] alextheblight: dorfs are cool tho
[2:06:51] Nulgar: @Arkavien make that two clodagHorde
[2:07:03] thunduz: we finally got playable dragons with no gear so Ethereal's should be ok
[2:07:09] Honorbound94: Honorbound94 subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 42 months! @TaliesinAndEvitel They could do ethereals the same way that they do Dracthyr and have them shift into a different form
[2:07:13] drizzeh33: we need a centuar playable race
[2:07:17] grimblymcgoo: Are earthen immune to bleeds?
[2:07:19] MaharatD7: cause they can be horde prob, thats why
[2:07:21] thunduz: @Honorbound94 great minds
[2:07:36] Honorbound94: You know it @thunduz  hahaha
[2:07:40] Saiyori: I know /one/ person that's happy abt earthen but she's a die hard dwarf fan and any dwarf can do no wrong in her eyes
[2:07:41] cabeshpash: yeeeas
[2:07:41] vandis1022: Still waiting for skinny kul tirans
[2:07:41] realiteegaming: Earthen hype
[2:07:56] JMan31337: murloc race
[2:07:57] alextheblight: dwarf fan here. More dwarves are cool
[2:07:59] Toiarc: I want Tuskarr race, other expansion features like new dungeons and raids is not mandatory if we just get Tuskarr race
[2:08:05] Darty12111: Ogre race you can play either faction like Pandaren.
[2:08:09] Nulgar: @thunduz @Honorbound94 like, an illusion form that shows how they looked before the destruction of K'aresh? That gets broken in combat, so they behave like Worgen.
[2:08:28] darth_nykal: its the female undead model
[2:08:36] Rhys_Velaris: Does it even matter if you are horde or alliance anymore aside from aesthetic for race since you can collectively join guides as either now?
[2:08:37] alextheblight: thin humans guzuDink
[2:08:46] Rhys_Velaris: guilds*
[2:08:53] Arlaeya: THANK YOU my mage is a nerd who can't even lift his spellbooks and got veins popping out his forearms wtf?!
[2:08:54] mageyathink: I also want a John deer tractor mount awarded from maxing all proffs.  Then you could farm everything by changing what you hook up to the back of the tractor
[2:09:10] JMan31337: females normally took less screen space
[2:09:36] Saiyori: i want them to have upright posture tho
[2:09:45] thunduz: @Nulgar ooooo I like that
[2:09:49] Honorbound94: @Nulgar I was thinking more you could be any race, similar to a visage form
[2:10:02] darth_nykal: eww sexy nerubians give me the ick
[2:10:05] thunduz: @Nulgar like a little void explosion happens when you shape out
[2:10:07] Honorbound94: @Nulgar but I definitely like yours more
[2:10:17] Nulgar: @Honorbound94 nah, the Ethereals have a specific backstory, they were a distinct mortal race
[2:10:22] realiteegaming: i hope we get more dwarf variations
[2:11:02] thunduz: push just a little more tali we almost got him
[2:11:10] Honorbound94: @Nulgar Yeah I know, I was thinking more that like they were so twisted and deformed that it was too difficult to recall their original form
[2:11:10] databob1: I wanted the tortellen as a player race...I had plans
[2:11:44] thunduz: I was at blizzcon and I zoned out of Ybarra talking and listened to tali stream instead tneEvi
[2:12:16] darth_nykal: @databob1 omg yes, wow showing how to make actual turtle people
[2:13:07] alextheblight: @databob1 I wanted to make a tottollan monk
[2:13:09] JMan31337: I mean he did take us all from Vanilla through Lichking that was the WC3 saga
[2:13:15] thunduz: completely agree with Evi. Holly just gives off really trusting vibes and feels like she really cares
[2:13:17] alextheblight: tortollan, even
[2:13:32] darth_nykal: corruption
[2:13:42] JMan31337: well i should say RTS i guess not WC3
[2:13:47] Syzmical: show him the current dk set
[2:13:51] ancester: how is this podcast called ?
[2:13:52] blumberquack: TBC lock sets were so dope, yeah
[2:13:53] Syzmical: thatll be a quick change of heart
[2:13:57] darth_nykal: Corruption set
[2:14:00] liveshowfieldy: nope still waiting for them to do that haha
[2:14:06] darth_nykal: from Serpent shrine
[2:14:33] Darty12111: the MoP Challenge gear for hunter is cool

[2:23:37] thunduz: if they were smart they would buy you shades as a gift
[2:23:40] Nulgar: wait, you didn't explain this at least to their parents?
[2:23:47] Anelit21: I mean they are 16... what do they know Xd
[2:23:48] Saiyori: have they not heard of bi people tho? xD

[2:24:02] Kshantos: invite garrett over
[2:24:05] Gaming_Mama56: that will teach them to look into peoples windows.. good thing it wasn't scat porn
[2:24:23] Alonarius: @nulgar are you suggesting they go over and chap on their door as if that's not going to make them seem like massive creeps to their parents?!
[2:24:33] karioke19: love it lol
[2:24:36] thunduz: no tali needs to wear it
[2:24:43] thunduz: oh perfect
