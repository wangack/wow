[2:09:25] craboskai: he thinks it was obvious they would only do 10man KEKL
[2:09:26] rehlytcranston: This post is intended. If they weren't "allowed" to, it wouldn't be randomly posted by multiple devs
[2:09:27] xelm_: literally nobody knew
[2:09:43] 0ddjob: 20 man raid would be baaad for casuals
[2:09:43] linkitcraig: we baited it out of him

[2:09:50] helmetnach0s: he said it had been mentioned in a comment somewhere but not widely known
[2:10:06] AceOfFlame: Maybe rest of the lvl up raids will be 10 man and the point of lvl up raids was just going to be 10 mans
[2:10:15] Psalm34: 10 thousand person raid

[2:11:22] Utmost777: was BWL 40 man?
[2:11:22] craboskai: not when you are the organizing them KEKL

[2:12:00] MartLz: lol tik tok raid
[2:12:03] Bronloch: EQ1 40-Man raids had little groups and solo players trailing the raid and farming respawns on their own it was very cool

[2:13:42] cadeg29: ohhh ty
[2:13:50] Altos__: problem with 40man is that no sane fight can require 8 tanks
[2:13:50] sound_wayv: people here confused by pronouns arent gonna understand that math lmao
[2:13:53] ShadowPoet: math
[2:14:00] Eras25: 2x2=22 ?

[2:14:28] DankWizard420: 10man DansGame
[2:14:34] xelm_: 10 man is terrible
[2:14:43] DuoX: 10 man only even for molten core
[2:14:45] ThisGuyisLocal: what if 25m made the 40s hard but still doable with runes
[2:14:46] Psalm34: 10 man ubrs, 10 man scholo were aweseome
[2:14:51] Altos__: 10man is just UBRS, barely qualifies as a raid
[2:14:51] KrotonGG: 20 man and 40 man
[2:14:52] Bronloch: Make raids open world non-instanced pvp zones! SwiftRage
[2:14:53] sighwarlock: Must have 40 man raids.
[2:14:53] j011yj0e230: Its not niche.. but I can't put my tongue on it.

[2:14:57] sighwarlock: like a must have.
[2:15:02] sound_wayv: add a 10man kara at 60
[2:15:06] DankWizard420: I'd rather setup 1 40man raid than 4 10mans KEKW
[2:15:10] MartLz: kinda biased my man
[2:15:13] jimbooey19: has he said why he prefers 10/25 man? other than being in a smaller guild
[2:15:14] dagummit1: do you think maybe they do like a small patch in a phase to introduce a new 20 man raid or not shot due to time constraints of the phase?
[2:15:45] DankWizard420: feedback only on twitter pepeLaugh
[2:15:58] vision42g: this guy low key looks like hasbulla KEKW

[2:16:46] nemo___x: GIGACHAD
[2:16:46] kaiju_kin: too much,
[2:16:47] DankWizard420: no way
[2:16:47] ascension_girl: Do you think they will let us freeze XP gains in SoD? (like twinking etc)
[2:16:49] AceOfFlame: it makes it so theres less fomo, thats really just the reason
[2:17:03] Cielos: 30 min too long sstvWAT

[2:17:25] DankWizard420: the 30-70 percentile
[2:17:33] Eras25: whoa, my brain just exploded
[2:17:41] craboskai: but those people won't make it to lvl 40 in a week so what's the point of the delay KEKW
[2:17:41] Piorum_: The devs need to design the meta to be fun, is needing to "rush" to 40 to raid week 1 a fun meta? idk
[2:17:43] nemo___x: what does locking the raid even do tho? OMEGALUL
[2:17:49] OrganikCum: but does delaying the launch actually cater to that group? do they even care if they are playing a few hours a day?
[2:18:15] Cielos: This is kind of a no-brainer but the devs don't play at all so sstvSTARE
[2:18:17] Psalm34: why is every wow player a pseudo developer

[2:18:33] xelm_: ordering chik fil a whitepeopleHappy
[2:18:41] DankWizard420: literally takes 2weeks to level
[2:18:50] craboskai: @johnsmith_cb they are still gonna miss it KEKL
[2:18:55] AceOfFlame: @OrganikCum never underestimate the power of fomo even including the most casual players
[2:18:59] OrganikCum: not all of them, im a 3 hour dad and i couldnt care less
[2:19:00] johnsmith_cb: craboskai probably LULW
[2:19:05] MartLz: AVERAGE GAMER
[2:19:07] nemo___x: lets lock the raid 1month to make sure those dipshit can catchup FeelsOkayMan
[2:19:10] Cielos: dogLUL

[2:19:13] MartLz: cyrSmug
[2:19:13] Karlton93: sounds right
[2:19:15] craboskai: delay it for 1month so all the 5job dads don't feel left out FeelsOkayMan
[2:19:22] sound_wayv: 20 hours a week is a lot too
[2:19:24] BadGerbilLion: 52.5 hours with BFD gear?
[2:19:29] j011yj0e230: I may have misunderstood, 10 man is probably just right for 3 hour gamers
[2:19:30] Ezcotli: Ezcotli subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 21 months! 
[2:19:35] cadeg29: iM sPeCiAl????

[2:19:57] MartLz: i like how u put that lil bit of hair  in front daddy
[2:19:59] Moo360: i get why u wanna design around them but why does that mean delaying the raid? why does it matter if they miss a few lockouts?
[2:20:00] nemo___x: people wont " feel " bad OMEGALUL
[2:20:00] Cielos: The essence of classic is turbo nerd sweaty though
[2:20:18] minihansen12: Its not gonna take 3-4 hours each lvl wtf
[2:20:39] Ranzorx: does the casual player care that they missed  1 lockout?
[2:20:39] obstata: yea theres gonna be people with 3-4 lockouts b4 most get 40
[2:20:41] ThyLordEzekiel: why do all of these people want to turbo thru the content & raid day 1 & then sit for 3months & wait for the next one?
[2:20:44] nemo___x: fuck this equity shit GIGACHAD
[2:20:44] Psalm34: i think a majority of the player base will be 40 in 2 weeks
[2:20:46] Moo360: you don't miss a raid lockout, if they delay it then no one gets the lockout - how is that better?
[2:20:49] markusdx: at 17 days leveling they would miss plenty of lockouts
[2:21:03] cafrozed: Do you know if you can smoke caffeine powder matt?
[2:21:04] Piorum_: It's up to the devs to design the meta to be healthy and fun, you can never expect players to just not do something because its boring or not fun
[2:21:06] damasochist: @StaysafeTV you will be waiting in a que disconnected KEKW
[2:21:24] Ranzorx: im sweaty and I missed 2 lockouts at the beginning and it didnt matter at all
[2:21:38] DankWizard420: the reverse is also true KEKW
[2:21:43] nemo___x: many people will do the raid within 1 week OMEGALUL
[2:21:47] Moo360: why do people get happy by stopping others from enjoying content
[2:21:48] Sikuhtriz: I agree for the most part, except I don't think missing a raid lockout actually hurts casual gamers. They'll have less lockouts than sweaters, but they'll also have less everything than sweaters
[2:21:54] craboskai: because its blizzard holding the hands of players and telling them how they should play the game KEKL
[2:21:57] Ranzorx: apparently they are choosing to appease the twitter demographic lol
[2:22:00] MartLz: no ptr?
[2:22:01] Zaziben: why not 2 weeks? I think that targets the dad gamers better
[2:22:01] realgypso: they will be forced to interact with the average gamers for a week while they wait
[2:22:09] OrganikCum: gnomer confirmed 3 day lockout?
[2:22:11] Wingsofjanitor: Scottiejay racking up Ls yet again (incredibly common)
[2:22:15] minihansen12: the big boy lvlers is not even playing with the pleb lvlers so how do they know what they miss out on xd
[2:22:28] nemo___x: 1 piece wow
[2:22:30] Utmost777: it isn't about number of lockouts, it is about how you want the game to be played
[2:22:35] MartLz: ya its game over
[2:22:38] DankWizard420: and they know the bosses
[2:22:38] Zaziben: and that'd fine
[2:22:40] Rofak5: I would like to see gnomer released day on because of world first hype. more hype than 1 week waiting
[2:22:45] MartLz: but i keep trucking
[2:22:45] DinkytheDoodle: But do we feel that average players will even care they miss a lockout?
[2:22:46] zookiini: it splits the "race to 40" & "race to complete the raid" - which should be fun for the sweaties
[2:22:47] Lionkingler1: dont be casual
[2:22:48] nemo___x: @DankWizard420 don't worry casual player don't know fights by month 3
[2:22:53] p_fet: i think what a lot of people arent getting is that by opening the raid day 1, the normal players will feel pressure to rush thru leveling. Which doesnt feel nice.
[2:22:59] DankWizard420: @nemo___x yeah true KEKW
[2:23:00] ThyLordEzekiel: & then they pass on the dude who didnt do it week 1 & clear in the PUG theyre trying to join
[2:23:03] craboskai: its an mmorpg KEKL if you don't have the time then go play farmville or some other facebook game
[2:23:08] Spanky042: The casual player isn't actually out here getting upset at missing a lockout
[2:23:08] Raisenette: but those casuals were stuck on kelris for 2 lockouts already
[2:23:14] Tchoup504: They have no confirmed the length of lockout yet
[2:23:15] minihansen12: but you cant put it up like that - the plebs were never going to get the loot in the first way xD
[2:23:16] DaddySmelly: The problem is the 1/2% are the loudest, and are also the trendsetters. Streamers, YouTubers and reddit posters are going to lead the rest of the community follows them
[2:23:18] Lionkingler1: KEKL casual cucks crying
[2:23:18] theeasytitan: Yep and then toxic pugs happen week 2
[2:23:29] DuoX: common l take from scotty
[2:23:32] obstata: those people will be first anyways
[2:23:49] Moo360: the community is completely split on this though
[2:23:54] Mlp4gaming: world first would happen anyway, just a week later. His take is kinda stupid tbh
[2:23:56] j011yj0e230: Its time classic wow gets a party item to force /flex
[2:23:58] craboskai: twitter is not the community tho KEKL
[2:23:59] DankWizard420: *laughs in bg premades*
[2:24:02] Ranzorx: if you care about missing a lockout, then you arent a casual and will probably rush first raid anyway
[2:24:17] obstata: no matter when the raid releases, its gonna be the same ppl clearing it first
[2:24:25] Lionkingler1: almost as rigged as general election KEKW
[2:24:27] DankWizard420: you know what wow needs? and will never get? polls ingame like runescape :)
[2:24:33] coolcrazyguy72: mornin
[2:24:41] einself111: yeah who cares, doesn't matter really
[2:24:43] g0dzilla: im for delay aswell
[2:24:54] g0dzilla: makes me les pressured and more enjoying the game
[2:25:00] coolcrazyguy72: 40 degree days back to back right now -_-
[2:25:01] Ranzorx: its actually worse for casuals because they wont be able to look up boss guides before they go in KEKW
[2:25:05] Moo360: delaying doesn't stop the sweaties being ahead though, they just spend a week farming and getting all the prebis
[2:25:10] Moo360: and now it's a requirement to even enter
[2:25:14] Lionkingler1: aggrends question was a no question. I was loaded and he already made his mind up. He will delay it by a week @StaysafeTV
[2:25:14] wagyu_88: I want the raid to be delayed just to piss off the sweats :)
[2:25:16] kierownikzamieszania95: on the other hand who cares about speedrunning hardcores lol
[2:25:17] WeeNeeber: I vote for delay to annoy the poop sockers
[2:25:19] DankWizard420: @Ranzorx which is part of the fun imo
[2:25:20] chiief: you're in a bubble if you don't think the community wants it delayed
[2:25:25] Mlp4gaming: I will not miss the first lockout, but i would enjoy leveling more if the first lockout was delayed. It's not only for casuals
[2:25:28] subsonic_eye: idc either way, phase a2 is gonna be a long phase I think. I didn’t step for into bfd until 3 lock out and I’ve been full bis of weeks and almost bis on my alts
[2:25:41] g0dzilla: @Ranzorx its also good cause they can enjoy the raid without getting spoiled and learn there own way
[2:25:46] DankWizard420: cant even view twitter without an account KEKW
[2:25:47] Piorum_: @Moo360 ehh, honestly unless they buff the dungeon gear around 40 the bfd gear will likely be the pre-bis
[2:25:47] ShadowPoet: enjoy the journey
[2:25:50] MartLz: are people enjoying video games anymore?
[2:26:00] AceOfFlame: its the new world order
[2:26:03] Ranzorx: @g0dzilla the casual raider isnt going to enjoy wiping for no reason lol, they don't want it to be hard
[2:26:03] cgilb14: bruh, I thought that was you at first
[2:26:05] DuoX: ppl don't got to websites anymore
[2:26:27] ShadowPoet: damn lawyers
[2:26:34] DaveTheDoc: He/him they/their did not review blue post. Fire her!
[2:26:44] DankWizard420: which is funny because every employer I've ever had that doesnt swing pepeLaugh
[2:26:53] g0dzilla: @ranzorx, are you a casual? if no, how can you tell... humans are diffrent though... everything has pros and cons... you cant just say "they dont like it"
[2:27:16] DankWizard420: wowhead is big too
[2:27:25] Lionkingler1: YEP loaded question
[2:27:26] Ranzorx: @freedomfighter999 exactly everyone is happy
[2:27:31] tactical_rage_quit: Only thing that is good with poles is strippers..
[2:27:39] ShadowPoet: land lines - octogenarian
[2:27:40] Mahca_: casuals wont clear raid first lockout whether its delayed or not. itll be 5/7 bfd all over again
[2:27:49] AntarcticTreaty: dont you guys have phones?
[2:27:55] subsonic_eye: poll on zockify KEKW
[2:27:56] bigtrickymemeguy: @StaysafeTV would you have kick open forum political theory streams w/ viewers?
[2:27:57] Lionkingler1: Do you want X? Already influences the result of the poll
[2:28:00] Piorum_: They need an in-game poll system tbh
[2:28:02] Ranzorx: @g0dzilla im not a casual but I dont enjoy wiping so I would be for it. I dont care about the discovery of raid mechanics
[2:28:13] MartLz: wait til voting goes wireless
[2:28:20] DankWizard420: @Piorum_ like osrs that'l never happen KEKW
[2:28:41] johnsmith_cb: is the result public
[2:28:41] ShadowPoet: Good Idea
[2:28:43] lizcat_: no they know what’s best for us
[2:28:44] purpboyflex: everything passes
[2:28:48] sighwarlock: Send everyone some in-game mail that shows that the polls are open and where!
[2:28:49] GreenEyedGamingGal: Yeah sounds great idea
[2:28:52] purpboyflex: which is one downside
[2:28:55] Piorum_: @DankWizard420 Prayge we can cope
[2:28:56] DankWizard420: sometimes the polls are like 50 questions long Sadge
[2:28:56] Atomized: just like in real life the banks control the vote
[2:28:59] Bronloch: YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES
[2:29:02] sixpackchad: that's a bad way to do it. that would be like electing our president via popular vote.
[2:29:03] g0dzilla: @Ranzorx i dont enjoy wiping aswell... but some player dont mind... they want to sit there on weekend 2 hopurs finding out shit... without falling behind more and more...
[2:29:04] Mahca_: twitter users know whats best Keepo
[2:29:12] Ranzorx: id rather just let blizzard figure it out, seen some absolutely horrible ideas get lots of upvotes
[2:29:22] nemo___x: just make it a fresh reset at this point FeelsOkayMan
[2:29:34] DankWizard420: @Ranzorx ideas dont go into the poll, it's an aggregrate measuring
[2:29:35] ShadowPoet: do it at entrance to AH
[2:29:52] MarcoFlee: 100%
[2:29:54] Mahca_: for sure he is
[2:29:57] lizcat_: he’s pretty cringe
[2:29:57] orasay1996: for sure
[2:29:59] DankWizard420: 100% is
[2:30:00] WeeNeeber: Paladin player
[2:30:02] garbobean: mhmm
[2:30:04] DuoX: he plays warrior so no shock
[2:30:07] Atomized: YEP he's fat, common feminine behavior
[2:30:09] mazian4: Will you be questing to 40?
[2:30:09] craboskai: he ate too much slop FeelsOkayMan
[2:30:12] Altos__: passend aggrend
[2:30:13] Synmachus: Can I say it? Aggrend sounds like a dumbass
[2:30:14] botch19: He's got a big ol dick shed
[2:30:20] OrganikCum: he has to deal with a lot of dipshits pretending they have the answers as they make wild guesses
[2:30:21] Moondrius: Idk about passive aggressive. Just very open ended.
[2:30:33] lurtzz__: he’s a dick
[2:30:37] suddenarthritis4: he has to deal with classic wow forums monkaW
[2:30:39] ShadowPoet: SWG Kreygasm
[2:30:42] DankWizard420: pacifist Pog
[2:30:44] g0dzilla: @Synmachus for me, hes a smart guy using his brain... wich isnt common these days
[2:30:55] MonzonWasTaken: "pvp" KEKW
[2:31:25] DankWizard420: @Synmachus thinking you know too much is a quality required for wow leads (ion comes to mind easily)
[2:31:26] DuoX: nerfing warrior would be a great addition
[2:31:27] suddenarthritis4: bfd level up raids
[2:31:33] Raisenette: Dancing for XP PogChamp
[2:31:39] Nohez: If we know what we want, why do most people love the first version of the game the most. The only version of the game that is not affected by players opinion. We have complained on forums for 20 years and it gave us Dragonflight. So no, we do not know what we want.
[2:31:50] ShadowPoet: @raisenette LU:
[2:31:52] OrganikCum: its nice
[2:31:57] abruptdecayO_O: yeah the balance is actually a huge W
[2:31:59] MonzonWasTaken: if only it was locked
[2:32:01] Schbling: YEP
[2:32:07] ShadowPoet: @raisenette Dance for XP and buffs
[2:32:07] spainard15: Its NICE
[2:32:11] AntarcticTreaty: because there are no transfers
[2:32:24] warn1ng: bots filln spots not cool
[2:32:26] johnsmith_cb: whats the point of horde/alliance pve server
[2:32:38] DankWizard420: my guild didnt log over christmas Sadge
[2:32:40] helmetnach0s: prob the pvp events
[2:32:43] CygnusC: lots of alts
[2:32:46] ImSoDad: i raid 4 characters this is skewed
[2:32:50] nemo___x: i got 6 alt
[2:32:55] Karlton93: does it include greench parse?
[2:32:59] OptimusBanana420: season of alts
[2:33:02] franklinandarmfield: @nemo___x and no life EZ
[2:33:05] Kevnxd: But what if the raid doesnt get logged?
[2:33:07] Zargeras0: my alt has an alt by now
[2:33:10] DuoX: theres also a large number of ppl that don't even log, I know at least 5 guilds on my server that don't
[2:33:16] Scoffered: Also not everyone logs
[2:33:17] xrazzaks: good afternoon everyone
[2:33:18] g0dzilla: @Kevnxd doesnt show then
[2:33:19] WeeNeeber: I have never been in a logged raid done it a bunch
[2:33:20] Piorum_: There are so many alts in this version, especially now people are rerolling class
[2:33:29] dabba__: yeah but people are cranking out alts
[2:33:30] MrSuperFudge: amazing you had to explain that
[2:33:39] AceOfFlame: PepeLaugh
[2:33:55] Lionkingler1: almost certain more people arent logging
[2:33:59] ghostbagster: The just play for fun :)
[2:34:01] MartLz: immersion ruiner
[2:34:03] Kevnxd: i've probably done 50+ pugs of BFD and only around 20 of them are logged so.. ye
[2:34:17] g0dzilla: facts is, the number can only be bigger then shown ^^ cant be smaller :D
[2:34:24] Piorum_: The no logs argument is a lot stronger in this version too, so many more pugs which don't always log
[2:34:28] sighwarlock: i want a new world boss somewhere for the next phase
[2:34:47] sargent_baddy: true
[2:34:47] spainard15: SOD is really awesome so far!
[2:34:47] Gurrehh: ye i have been having fun blasting
[2:34:50] Mauraderss: do you like the displays behind him ?
[2:34:52] subsonic_eye: I find that usually at least one person logged bfd in pugs I do
[2:34:57] suddenarthritis4: same i like how they gave it more life
[2:35:03] DankWizard420: I dont need loot anymore but still turn up for the rest of the raid that do Pog
[2:35:10] MonzonWasTaken: phase 1 has been way too long
[2:35:12] c_a_i_n_a_m: c_a_i_n_a_m subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 6 months, currently on a 1 month streak! doing a raid tomorrow evening? I'd be down to heal one with ya
[2:35:18] rsSilence: BFD is fun, it's kinda like ToGC, just go hang out and blast, get some loot
[2:35:19] Mauraderss: ashuming??
[2:35:20] Mlp4gaming: BFD was great, especially considering you did it twice as much with the 3 day lockout, and still didn't burned out of it
[2:35:24] graceybfrg: will you be able to get tribal leatherworking?
[2:35:25] Lionkingler1: trainer already has the skill rank showing
[2:35:29] halflifez3: Ingame its 200 Level 41
[2:35:38] mazian4: 300
[2:35:41] slachi: 250
[2:35:43] OrganikCum: max level at 50 would be fine no?
[2:35:45] Piorum_: I bet 50 will just go to 300
[2:35:53] donkeebrainz: woah were live
[2:35:57] sargent_baddy: would be better 200/250/300
[2:35:57] Raivan994: 275 300
[2:35:59] spy_bones: if you look at the trainers it already says 41 to rain to 300
[2:36:01] slachi: Imagine if they did a level 70 teir for Kara
[2:36:06] spy_bones: to train*
[2:36:07] OrganikCum: level 60 they just add new reicpes
[2:36:09] g0dzilla: @Mlp4gaming i wish bfd would have been a 7day lockout and drop chance for legendary higher tbf
[2:36:31] DankWizard420: @g0dzilla yeah the 3day lockout is kinda zzz
[2:36:34] Xeronismm: im a gnome and i want it for 225 so we can get deathray
[2:36:40] OrganikCum: that would be cool
[2:36:48] Nohez: yeah at 25-150, 40-200, 50-250, 60-300, makes sense
[2:36:52] Raivan994: heresy!
[2:37:04] g0dzilla: 3day lockout is kinda pushing to hard imo  esp if you have like 3+ chars
[2:37:25] g0dzilla: even for casuals
[2:37:34] HoochieBaba: who did that
[2:37:57] Th3Whitey: to much meta gaming and sweaty kids. kinda just kills the game
[2:38:00] Moondrius: Farmed my goldthorn already. Thanks for the early tip.
[2:38:05] HoochieBaba: minor movespeed!
[2:38:05] Lionkingler1: +1 agi exists
[2:38:06] nemo___x: imagine being unable to miss a lockout , some people have dogs mental fortitude
[2:38:11] DuoX: some of us have boot enchants now
[2:38:15] Mlp4gaming: I liked 3 day lockout personnaly, but I can hear the argument against. Felt refreshing and less fomo for some reason, at least to me
[2:38:18] Piorum_: @g0dzilla true, the 3 day lockout is honestly what made me stop playing my alts, I just don't wait to raid 4-6 times a week every week
[2:38:26] DankWizard420: make it a passive buff imo
[2:38:34] MyOpiate: world buff need to be removed from dungeons... only for world
[2:38:36] spy_bones: if you look at the profession trainers in game it already says lvl 26 to train to 225 and 41 to train to 300
[2:38:43] AntarcticTreaty: Whitefathom
[2:38:47] madgarlicjr: tuned up
[2:38:47] ghostbagster: Thunder buff
[2:38:51] RockyMountainOyster: they should either remove it or cap BFD buff at like 39 to make it useless for raiding
[2:38:58] fartonyerhead: mechatoric blessing sounds fire LUL
[2:39:05] Mauraderss: but how do you keep old content relevant?
[2:39:05] Nohez: @spy_bones you can go 300 at 35 normally
[2:39:11] MonzonWasTaken: FirstTimeChatter
[2:39:18] satelolxd: satelolxd subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 39 months! Just make Blackfathom last until lvl 39 (not obtainable at 40) Boon of gnomeregan last until p3 max lvl -1 etc tbh
[2:39:22] ImaFanOfClassic: can you link the video?
[2:39:30] DankWizard420: about time
[2:39:31] AceOfFlame: that battleground update better be the meta
[2:39:33] Lionkingler1: YEP premades can only face pugs now
[2:39:35] MartLz: ROFL
[2:39:39] unscconnor2: thank god i cna single que
[2:39:42] Th3Whitey: about fuckin tiime
[2:39:43] xrazzaks: good stuff!
[2:39:46] TrooperHuge: heya!!!
[2:39:52] Th3Whitey: this isnt classic
[2:39:54] MonzonWasTaken: they need roles for pvp and premades v premades
[2:39:59] literalmountgod: they can scale BFD to make it 40
[2:39:59] Mlp4gaming: single queue is way more fun, spamming premade is very boring
[2:40:09] orasay1996: removed lockout PauseChamp
[2:40:23] g0dzilla: im so curious what they plan to do with bfd in p2...
[2:40:25] joe_wave: we are gonna get exp from these raids
[2:40:29] DankWizard420: kick it back down to a dungeon
[2:40:29] zachshnacks: They are taking away group Que of any kind. Only solo Que. does kind of suck, I enjoyed doing bgs with my friend
[2:40:29] Altos__: if they are leveling raids then Kelris should level up whenever he kills someone Kappa
[2:40:31] slachi: need to complete BFD to raise level cap from 25 Prayge
[2:40:31] realgypso: I think they are gonna removed the lock out
[2:40:31] CygnusC: daily or weekly quests
[2:40:35] madgarlicjr: it will just be really good xp doing it at lvl
[2:40:45] DankWizard420: @zachshnacks thank the 10mans for ruining it KEKW
[2:40:47] lordextraordinary: need to get the epic profession mats :P
[2:40:48] fartonyerhead: if that's the case - boon willl always be up then ? @staysafetv
[2:40:56] naughtiemares: I cannot wait for gnomer
[2:41:01] g0dzilla: but what about the legendary drops? do they remove them?
[2:41:04] CygnusC: the pearl quest is not repeatable right now
[2:41:13] DuoX: rune of make any class but warrior good
[2:41:16] mum_enjoyer: @DankWizard420 how dare people have friends they want to do WSG with
[2:41:18] OptimusBanana420: POGSLIDE

[2:41:34] zachshnacks: @dankwizard420 ya agreed but it would be better if they just made it limited to 5. Not being able to be in a group with anyone is too much
[2:41:35] OptimusBanana420: o7
[2:41:37] naughtiemares: That is some crybaby shit
[2:41:53] xelm_: hahaha

[3:39:27] xelm_: ur not wrong but rip mage
[3:39:28] AceOfFlame: @dagummit1 should ask why does every company who deals with bots always have the same problem including people who put GGG on pedestal has easily 10-20x more bots
[3:39:31] notadodger69: a old solution matthew...
[3:39:31] draqcula: used to be hunters at the beginning of sod
[3:39:33] dirbagdan: in vanilla it was hunters
[3:39:33] Psalm34: lmfao
[3:39:35] mattbarz989: All the bots are hunters
[3:39:35] notadodger69: the first solution
[3:39:37] mysteriousm4n: just cap aoe to like 20 mobs
[3:39:37] DuoX: hunters also
[3:39:38] bottlekiddz: cap AOE to 5
[3:39:40] notadodger69: the G problem

[3:40:01] notadodger69: why do we need mages
[3:40:06] notadodger69: druids why do we need mages
[3:40:08] AceOfFlame: @dagummit1 Last epoch right now is literally the only company who is even trying to deal with bots by making an entire new trade system that would hurt bots
[3:40:10] notadodger69: priests why do we need mages
[3:40:10] literalmountgod: KEKW
[3:40:12] Mungtime: in vanilla it was 20 chinese men in  a one bedroom apartment feeding their families
[3:40:19] notadodger69: they're just hackers
[3:40:22] notadodger69: all mages are just hackers
[3:40:25] notadodger69: remove them

[3:40:34] ShadowPoet: dude
[3:40:35] draqcula: AMAZIN EZ
[3:40:47] DuoX: all it takes to stop bottters is literally hire a human being for every server . In an 8 hour work day they could investigate and ban hundreds a day.

[3:40:54] notadodger69: can you hack with a warlock?

[3:44:03] CoolTV: Kappa Clap sure

[3:44:09] izikperz: Kappa
[3:44:09] synix55: blizzard sells gold via wow tokens... its no different
[3:44:13] j011yj0e230: The bots clearly have earned their spot so lets make a nopixel wow
[3:44:24] Th3Whitey: id put it like this if i meet someone from blizzard at a bar idk how it go
[3:44:24] EarSlug: kinda like the gov
[3:44:40] deuces88: so if you dont care about botters, why did you care so much about multiboxers
[3:44:41] marceltheold: Principles shouldn't be that flexible and reliant on the behavior of others
[3:44:45] ShadowPoet: So much money going around
[3:44:47] dirbagdan: so you can run a VM farm too lol
[3:44:53] Chaboi_Twill: fix/perfect the UI and dont allow addons

[3:46:58] nickssecretstream: wooo
[3:47:09] marceltheold: acceptance and particapation of the most visable players has helped normalize the behavior. in short the player bases deserves it at this point

[3:47:26] draqcula: @huntmw2600 YES we need to bring public execution of botters in main capitals of horde/alliance
[3:47:28] deuces88: @doctorjoker12 just easier to do with software, but you can still do it w/o
[3:47:31] xelm_: @DankWizard420 same KEKW
[3:47:32] grizz430: they just res who cares?
[3:47:44] marceltheold: ZERO chance Blizzard has been unable to stop this sooner
[3:47:49] johnsmith_cb: naaah, its because the market is saturated
[3:47:53] dirbagdan: how about dont refund the players money if the botter gets caught and doesnt folow through? losing money is the only punishment people understand. This will deter it. And then just crack down on botters. boom!

[3:48:48] Valencia_Pete: classic era is real bad lol
[3:48:50] Th3Whitey: blizzard is just bad and they dont care they makin money
[3:48:51] marceltheold: Best thing Blizzard could have done was hammer Soda and other streamers that are doing it to scare people
[3:48:55] Aiden92: we need a Gold reset for all wow exp. X)
[3:49:01] mysteriousm4n: GDKP is actually a great system.....IF gold buying didnt exist

[3:49:25] DankWizard420: BASED
[3:49:27] CoolTV: agreed
[3:49:30] DankWizard420: gdkps are a plague
[3:49:30] doctorjoker12: ROFL thats just cause your a streamer and dont do them
[3:49:32] Somra: the money is too dirty
[3:49:38] TiptonBlessed: i just dont play the game kek
[3:49:39] BajeniZta: yeah im so over to se gdkp in world chat
[3:49:42] johnsmith_cb: how do you shut down gdkp, only way that comes to mind is personal loot
[3:49:44] joonelius3: gdkp is most fair loot system if people wouldnt buy gold.
[3:49:44] Brightleaf: no gold buying and no gdkps allowed would be great
[3:49:44] synix55: they problem is gold has huge in game value, and is hard to get.  I've played many mmo's where gold is not a big deal, and no reason to buy... blizzard needs to follow suit.
[3:49:45] dirbagdan: YEP you can pug without gdkp. ban that shit
[3:49:47] huntmw2600: 1.7mill pots on horde firemaw like wtf
[3:49:49] doctorjoker12: saying shutting down gdkps shows me you truly have no idea what the average player does every
[3:49:50] OptimusBanana420: yo
[3:49:55] joonelius3: banning gdkp would be so bad.
[3:49:57] DankWizard420: @johnsmith_cb really simple, ban YEP
[3:49:58] TrooperHuge: This GDKP is the worst ever!
[3:49:59] doctorjoker12: every day*(
[3:50:00] bone555: KEKW
[3:50:02] Somra: @doctorjoker12 gold buyer in chat
[3:50:05] therealrickdiculous: if RMT could be removed GDKPs would be the best
[3:50:07] DuoX: simonize is a streamer and does gdkps all day
[3:50:09] CoolTV: GDKPs are terrible for the game
[3:50:12] BajeniZta: youst bann the shit
[3:50:14] DuoX: some ppl just have morals
[3:50:15] Bronloch: Streamers are paid to do GDKPs for gold mining corpos
[3:50:19] doctorjoker12: im being realistic. 80% of the playerbase would quit without GDKPS.
[3:50:22] DankWizard420: blizzard literally supports gold buying/selling via the token
[3:50:24] Bronloch: SOME streamers*
[3:50:28] xelm_: ive never once been to a GDKP. ever. never will
[3:50:28] TrooperHuge: @Bronloch wait this real?
[3:50:29] BobLongMVP: @StaysafeTV srry if you already know but Sardaco got a 2 week suspension today
[3:50:30] marceltheold: Dude the vast majority of streamers do and promote gdkps. Staysafe is the onlyone I can think of that doesnt
[3:50:31] dirbagdan: @doctorjoker12 lol no it wouldnt
[3:50:34] Th3Whitey: get they need to Ban GDKP
[3:50:35] realgypso: especially in SoD
[3:50:36] Mawshaw: @doctorjoker12 Source?
[3:50:38] Aiden92: @doctorjoker12 haha ok bye
[3:50:43] Mungtime: @doctorjoker12 thats so wrong KEKW
[3:50:49] Br0connell: nothing wrong with gdkp. the prob is bots/sellers.
[3:50:51] Somra: @doctorjoker12 that's just wrong doctor
[3:50:57] bahsingha: even the mount and the skill gets lower cost
[3:50:58] LoRswat: who all has been banned recently?  Soda, Sardoco....anyone else?
[3:51:01] Th3Whitey: they are so many easy fixes but blizzard will never do
[3:51:03] deuces88: so you're saying some of the other streamers, like amphy, grays, and a few others who host gdkps, promote gold buying
[3:51:05] AceOfFlame: @doctorjoker12 Painting a narrative to fix the agenda ICANT
[3:51:11] DuoX: if you report gdkp spam it goes away. My fresh wrath server had 0 gdkps because they got reported off the server.
[3:51:11] Th3Whitey: its a shit company that is just in it for the money
[3:51:14] DankWizard420: @LoRswat and sodas shouldve been a lot worse like 100x worse KEKW
[3:51:16] bottlekiddz: toss in gold caps
[3:51:21] doctorjoker12: if you think people play wow legitimately anymore your insane. if people CANT buy their way through the game. they will play rocket league or apex. but ok
[3:51:37] Somra: GDKPs are just bought and paid for with dirty gold, I'll never think someone will outbid me without thinking they bought gold
[3:51:44] mysteriousm4n: monkaW
[3:51:45] marceltheold: There is a large portion of the player base that gets their positions from streamers. Thats why RMT is so rampant
[3:51:46] BobLongMVP: I believe somebody traded Sardaco dirty gold in his gdkps
[3:51:51] Mawshaw: @doctorjoker12 Just because you buy gold doesn't mean everyone else does
[3:51:59] joonelius3: for some of us raids are the part we are best at in wow so gdkp is great way to earn money. If blizz would ban gdkps they’d stop big portion of gameplay from me aswell.
[3:52:05] marceltheold: "Streamer so and so does it so it must be ok"
[3:52:08] rothchilds: @StaysafeTV kill it now
[3:52:08] PretentiousCat: I think its tied to how loot system is in game, if the loot system was revamped it would curb gdkp
[3:52:19] draqcula: BASED
[3:52:22] doctorjoker12: @Mawshaw your mental must be ruined to go right to HES A GOLD BUYER

[3:54:23] tampaESPORTS: HOWS UR BOY DOING @StaysafeTV
[3:54:25] the_bhagwan: actually insane that one hour of consumables is more expensive on the first version of the game than the latest.. like not even counting inflation
[3:54:32] DuoX: i don 't understand how gdkp is fun. The whole point of wow is the dopamine hit from winning rolls lol
[3:54:32] ch33seweasel: I'm pretty sure the biggest reason I don't play WoW more is because of bots, it annoys the crap out of me. But yeah I don't blame the people doing it when Blizz does nothing about it. At the end of the day those bots end up paying more than I do.
[3:54:32] mazian4: @vill4franca how long was ur ban?
[3:54:39] vejitas4: gold buyers need to get a chronic hemorroids

[3:55:40] kittyomnomnomz: hire movers

[3:55:53] J4CKasd: family to the streets
[3:55:57] lizcat_: take your time what’s the rush
[3:56:00] marceltheold: If I could find a game that is even remotely as good as WoW I wouldnt be playing it. Unfortuntely RMT and trash pandas have destroyed gaming and as soon as a good game is released they destroy it like locust
[3:56:07] lizcat_: yeah that’s a good idea
[3:56:11] mysteriousm4n: smart

[5:29:09] kalmah2112: i had loads of money to support kids, but i just straight up didnt want one until i was like 29
[5:29:16] fatangrychicken: I stop at 1, cost too much, and we work too much
[5:29:17] Metaphix: they dont feel secure enough for kids
[5:29:18] Steebadin: @naughtiemares I'm hoping that they will stay as permanent SoD servers?
[5:29:18] Lionkingler1: they cant afford them
[5:29:18] Varren__: most 22 yr old men are still children lol

[5:29:45] Lionkingler1: billionaires class responsible for that problem YEP
[5:29:53] caltex88: I have three, and we'd have more if we could afford them.
[5:29:55] tyrone710: we are worried about the future for ourselves. seems impossible to imagine having kids around to deal with that
[5:29:59] bluntsamurai420: people aren't willing to commit to a marriage and kids
[5:30:01] A5H0J: I was in no way mentally mature enough to have children at 25
[5:30:01] naughtiemares: @sixpackchad Got the formula right, got to have your fun as a young man and now you are gonna raise a kid in your middle age

[5:30:35] Metaphix: mango is the shit
[5:30:37] carlos_the_7th: They would rather believe they are making a choice with the "my lineage dies with me" rather than admiting that economy is harsh and they would have children if they could
[5:30:37] Arcsilin: ???
[5:30:39] naughtiemares: I love almost all fruit, I don't like sweets though

[5:31:32] jrdman: being fat is mostly genetics anyway stop shaming them sadge
[5:31:35] seymourmoney: @pappej definetly not. Most of my friends who graduated college don't think they will ever own a house. Only the trademen
[5:31:38] naughtiemares: Some fruits are great for you but like you said, most are just natural sugar

[5:32:28] NutterCircus: It isnt fat shaming if you are not fat PogO
[5:32:30] xelm_: @Varels1 just marry a based trad wife to cook you real food. problem solved.
[5:32:38] artilectXLII: ...fruit is better than bread & pasta... fructose needs to be processed by liver for it to be consumed by the body. there is some max speed at which your liver can do that conversion... fructose rises blood-sugar *much* less than bread/pasta
[5:32:39] numblezzz: sorry that anti fruit rant was retarded
[5:32:43] bone555: KEKW

[5:34:50] NutterCircus: NOPERS
[5:35:00] naughtiemares: I do cooking and dishes
[5:35:00] Summerville: 5 seconds :D
[5:35:16] numblezzz: the average staysafe viewer is legally blind and has 500 ms reaction time with none of their abilities bound
[5:35:18] naughtiemares: I was raised doing dishes for a house with 5 boys so dishes are nothing to me
[5:35:28] woodgnomes: first hit "cat"
[5:35:51] woodgnomes: Hi dad <3
[5:35:54] naughtiemares: I loathe laundry
[5:36:01] Varels1: lol
[5:36:04] naughtiemares: I seriously don't know why it bothers me so much
[5:36:05] TurboBased: Texas vs the federal gov

[5:36:31] xelm_: 10,000+ a week
[5:36:33] LabraDuck: you lost this fight 50 years ago
[5:36:34] unscconnor2: Supreme court really fucking failed this country
[5:36:37] Lionkingler1: YEP
[5:36:39] 5by_five: its absolutely insane
[5:36:41] caltex88: true
[5:36:43] muffinguns: yup
[5:36:44] TurboBased: YEP
[5:36:44] Arcsilin: theyre all paid off
[5:36:45] TheDastardlyD: true
[5:36:48] Lionkingler1: thats true you can look it up
[5:36:53] naughtiemares: Out of their fucking minds
[5:36:55] Milanesa_De_Pollo: And here's why that's a good thing.
[5:36:56] helmetnach0s: its an inside job
[5:36:57] naughtiemares: It will ruin this nation
[5:37:03] Plathyy: low T issue
[5:37:04] smurrflounge: they gonna get shipped right up to NY/Chicago/etc. lol
[5:37:04] Kazamttv: the doom of america
[5:37:07] skizzzikk: not at all my guy, they voted the federal government has control over the border
[5:37:08] granais: no there are 5 women
[5:37:10] muffinguns: roberts
[5:37:10] tendollafatha: Amy is soft
[5:37:11] TheDastardlyD: 5 women
[5:37:12] NutterCircus: Roberts...
[5:37:13] xelm_: soon enough our money will be worth nothing
[5:37:14] granais: john roberts isnt a man
[5:37:14] unscconnor2: John roberts
[5:37:20] CannonM2K: HahaThink
[5:37:21] Lionkingler1: BASED men
[5:37:21] Arcsilin: women L
[5:37:29] tendollafatha: roberts did too
[5:37:30] numblezzz: every single city has heroin addicts and angry jamals loitering in front of every store. give it 10 years, will all be favelas
[5:37:31] NutterCircus: Roberts might as well be a woman.
[5:37:32] harvenius: Its so interesting how the political sides have entirely flipped their stance on immigration vs ~1990s.
[5:37:36] skizzzikk: there isnt even 5 woman on the supreme court my guy
[5:38:01] naughtiemares: The desperation of the people coming in has grown as well
[5:38:04] naughtiemares: Though
[5:38:06] tepsx: what if theyre using the illegal immigrants to get more voters for biden
[5:38:18] sixpackchad: @tepsx woah...can you even imagine
[5:38:22] caltex88: Corporate repubs want their cheap labor.
[5:38:23] unscconnor2: Good on abbot and the texas national guard for continuing to build the razor wire despite what the supreme court said
[5:38:24] numblezzz: i love hearing this take that "we need immigrants for the economy".....for jobs that have had their wages plummet due to migrants? okay lol
[5:38:24] hauserdot: @tepsx that’s exactly what they do KEKW
[5:38:26] helmetnach0s: Trump is the actual RINO
[5:38:26] Lionkingler1: free labour for their donors YEP
[5:38:30] artilectXLII: ...the judges have been black-mailed for a long time... wake up FeelsBadMan
[5:38:33] OrganikCum: texans have the advantage of actually being in texas so they will just keep putting up barbed wire
[5:38:43] cyonara74: @StaysafeTV Greg Abbott is based
[5:38:44] xelm_: Libs will be the downfall of this country
[5:38:45] Ericj1337: But Trump didn't exactly "change" anything...hell my wife's brother and sister crossed the border under him
[5:38:46] darthterac: so sad
[5:38:49] darkCloud43: i would prefer the borders remained closed
[5:38:57] naughtiemares: Trump is the most socialist president we have ever had because of the covid stimulus
[5:38:59] AintFinnaSubscribe: crazy idea I know, imagine if you had more than two political parties
[5:39:06] TurboBased: I'm surprised hes holding
[5:39:17] sixpackchad: @Ericj1337 illegal immigration was at a 40 year old under trump. today illegal immigration is at the highest it's been in US history
[5:39:17] naughtiemares: Locks are for rocks
[5:39:22] naughtiemares: And closets
[5:39:25] sixpackchad: @sixpackchad 40 year low*
[5:39:26] cgilb14: lol
[5:39:26] numblezzz: trump was pro vaccine asap, but people conveniently forget that
[5:39:29] ScarfaceCEO: He has a week spine.  Kappa
[5:39:30] NutterCircus: The Fed Gov is supposed to "Insure" Each state has a Republican form of Government.
[5:39:37] ScarfaceCEO: Weak*
[5:39:49] caltex88: He grew a ball sack
[5:39:50] sixpackchad: @numblezzz he didn't attempt to force anyone to get it though
[5:39:59] unscconnor2: @StaysafeTV they are still putting up the razor wire walls depsite the supreme court ruling
[5:40:04] Lionkingler1: nothing
[5:40:05] sal_rl: Texas is still putting them up
[5:40:06] TheDastardlyD: we just ignored that shit lol
[5:40:08] sal_rl: BASED
[5:40:09] skizzzikk: they can for sure
[5:40:10] Arcsilin: they just put up more anyway today
[5:40:10] DaddySmelly: Finances
[5:40:13] TurboBased: Imagine if the thing that mobilizes the federal gov is to stop Texas from closing the border
[5:40:15] Lionkingler1: private property
[5:40:16] Arcsilin: W Texas
[5:40:20] ScarfaceCEO: Supposedly they are still constructing them in opposition to the ruling.
[5:40:25] naughtiemares: @numblezzz Also when trump approved hyperdrive he has no idea the shitstorm that would ensue with the vaccines
[5:40:27] skizzzikk: they just said the federal government can tear it down, abbot can put it right back up
[5:40:35] Arcsilin: they already did
[5:40:36] bone555: KEKW KEKW
[5:40:37] tendollafatha: supremacy clause
[5:40:48] Arcsilin: they just keep putting stuff up anyways
[5:40:49] gilgergesh: @ScarfaceCEO they are allowed to keep raising barbed wire feds can just keep taking it down
[5:40:53] plddn: 10ft higher  is now 100 ft back
[5:40:53] cgilb14: I’d vote for you as a politician
[5:40:56] tjr2mental: it is federal for 150 miles in from the border
[5:40:59] caltex88: The ruling didn't say Texas couldn't build them, merely that feds could tear them down. But Texas is just keep on building and not granting feds access to tear them out
[5:41:07] mint358: Texas could stop being a bunch of pussys there’s that
[5:41:13] lizcat_: illegal votes FeelsStrongMan
[5:41:21] xelm_: ^
[5:41:23] lizcat_: bus them in no id laws
[5:41:25] pappej: Actively opening the door to illegal immigration in that way should result in a prison sentence tbh
[5:41:27] lizcat_: Democrat votes
[5:41:31] numblezzz: my liberal father has gotten rapidly redpilled due to Biden's treatment of migrant problem and bring mulvaney into white house
[5:41:35] hauserdot: this has been going on for four years
[5:41:35] sixpackchad: biden has never had a set of beliefs. they change with whatever he thinks will garner him support with his base. he's a weak career politician
[5:41:43] artilectXLII: Texas should do everything possible to completely disconnect from the influence of DC without actually leaving USA
[5:41:48] basedlamarck: democrats are possibly giving up the 2024 election for a short term electoral loss, but betting that the massive influx of immigrants will ensure long term electoral gain in the decades to come
[5:41:56] NutterCircus: Did you know "March of the Murlocs" started at Blizzcon?
[5:42:01] Arcsilin: its dumb might aswell just get ice blocked for 45 secs
[5:42:04] basedlamarck: democrats win because they make smart, cynical long term calculations like opening the border
[5:42:07] lizcat_: yes
[5:42:13] Ericj1337: @sixpackchad ya but who gives a shit. They come here to work hard and as a white person who works construction they work a hell of a lot better than all the other white people boss has hired. And your ass would cross the border also if you were born there. Let's be real. America is the best country ever
[5:42:14] literalmountgod: democrats dont even want a trump/biden debate
[5:42:15] numblezzz: projections are looking very pro trump for the swing states
[5:42:20] xelm_: we cant let them gain power ever again
[5:42:21] bone555: So true king
[5:42:31] darthterac: 2020 all over again
[5:42:43] darthterac: Biden will win again and die in office
[5:42:45] harvenius: the dems have what, the abortion laws? nothing else?
[5:42:45] photek_tn: i would fuggin love to see a biden trump debate...omg the memes.
[5:42:50] mint358: I have family in Texas… they are not impressed obviously
[5:42:54] Piorum_: Bone vip when!?!!?
[5:42:56] artilectXLII: ...c'mon they can have another 'leak' that gets them more vote-by-mail ... EZ
[5:42:57] bone555: Im a hatewatcher
[5:42:57] caltex88: @Ericj1337 Because a country is not an economic zone. Absent the immigrant labor supply, you'd be making a lot more money.
[5:42:58] sixpackchad: @Ericj1337 i agree America is the best country ever. but the federal government has no duty to non-US citizens.
[5:43:01] numblezzz: i dont even like trump cuz he is a wall kisser, but better than any alternative. hilarious to see him win again
[5:43:01] Kazamttv: suck his D
[5:43:08] cloudstrife543: wtf is a super fan
[5:43:10] unscconnor2: @basedlamarck wont beneift them if trump actually follows through with his mass deportation effort he has promised
[5:43:21] hauserdot: I AM A CERTIFIED WALL KISSER
[5:43:22] JackSunn92: What gear do you still need from BFD?
[5:43:26] bone555: @cloudstrife543 we stormed the capitol together
[5:43:31] pappej: Is it not already past the tipping point?
[5:43:34] DaddySmelly: Back to Martha's vineyard
[5:43:34] TurboBased: YEP
[5:43:46] cloudstrife543: oh true
[5:43:46] Ericj1337: @sixpackchad well my (guuat9
[5:43:50] rocknsake: that's exactly why the dems want an open border
[5:43:50] NutterCircus: The end result is a Narco State.
[5:43:51] mint358: it won’t happen again this time ain’t no way
[5:43:52] TurboBased: and breeding
[5:43:52] sixpackchad: hopefully Trump actually enacts a mass deportation border, and seals off the border
[5:44:04] Ericj1337: @sixpackchad hold on
[5:44:09] DaddySmelly: @staysafetv why are Mexican illegals voting?
[5:44:13] numblezzz: supposedly venezuelan immigrants are voting red where ever they move to. shows what socialism does to a people
[5:44:16] darkCloud43: and also all the california people who moved to texas
[5:44:18] 5by_five: is the hispanic demographic really that blue?
[5:44:19] xelm_: how can they vote with no social
[5:44:19] bmillybmilly: i worked in congress for a semester and it is pretty crazy at how many nationalities get caught trying to illegal cross the border
[5:44:23] caltex88: It's not the Mexicans that are the problem. Mexicans in Texas are pretty close to a toss-up.
[5:44:31] Xara36: wait, i dont think thats right, hispanics voted red along the border, trump won all but 1 of those counties, they dont like it either
[5:44:36] mint358: btw… fuck working when it’s 6 degrees outside
[5:44:43] rocknsake: @xelm_ just go to the right state.  in maryland they don't even check your ID, you just show up and walk in to the voting booth
[5:44:46] tjr2mental: how are they voting?  I know in michigan you need to jump though hoops to vote.
[5:44:47] NutterCircus: Because they want to Mexico our USA DansGame
[5:44:49] jameserush1: in new jersey they dont even ask for my ID when i go to vote
[5:44:57] TurboBased: they'll get amnesty eventually too
[5:44:58] cloudstrife543: not in florida
[5:45:02] numblezzz: mexicans that choose to live in mexico are the red blooded, conservative patriots. that weak people that leave are the degens
[5:45:02] sixpackchad: @Xara36 there's a different between america citizens of hispanic origin, and illegal immigrants
[5:45:11] caltex88: Most illegal aliens these days are from all over the world, very few from Mexico
[5:45:11] daywalker1014: tf
[5:45:21] rocknsake: i almost got kicked out of a voting place for demanding they check my ID
[5:45:21] Brightleaf: Yeah same in LA, no ID check and it was electronic lol
[5:45:23] crumbler81: man ID should be required everywhere
[5:45:24] Garvell01: tf how??
[5:45:25] rocknsake: in MD
[5:45:27] xT0Yx: That's crazy
[5:45:28] tjr2mental: so your saying the people at the polling station did not do thier job.
[5:45:28] FknWorst: thats actually insane
[5:45:34] cyonara74: is that mage healing?
[5:45:38] AxelFromAustralia: Americans still think they have a choice lol
[5:45:44] bots_bots: and yet almost no one does...
[5:45:44] harvenius: the ballot isn't tied to your social security id or anything?
[5:45:45] xelm_: im sure many libs did just that
[5:45:47] mint358: u was the difference
[5:45:48] sssyxxx: 10  votes arent going to change anything though
[5:45:52] mint358: the fuck
[5:45:55] artilectXLII: ...honestly listening to this concern about political decisions seems silly... looking like we are in zombie-apocalypse-scenario... you know the deep-wasting-desease? imagine there was one in humans; then think about 13 billion shots that got delivered past immune-barriers 🪦
[5:46:02] cyonara74: did you see all those democrats voting for haley in the NH primary?
[5:46:02] leroylol: even if you voted in 10 places ur votes would still get thrown in the garbage
[5:46:07] bots_bots: voter fraud is rare thats common knowledge
[5:46:08] gajitron: hate politics
[5:46:11] numblezzz: @arlaster nah, we've accepted that any leader will be a puppet for the pentagon and israel. we choose among what we have
[5:46:14] SmokinCigs210: votes don’t really matter though, electoral college?
[5:46:16] xelm_: yeah bullshit
[5:46:16] artilectXLII: deer-wasting-disease***
[5:46:19] DaddySmelly: In Australia we don't have Id checks, but you give your name and get checked off on the electoral roll, then if you've been checked off at more than one location you get investigated
[5:46:19] Garvell01: xd
[5:46:26] bone555: KEKW
[5:46:27] sal_rl: If you think there is 0 election fraud you're a moron
[5:46:28] sixpackchad: @SmokinCigs210 don't get started on that crap bro lol
[5:46:32] eshonxv: yeh that person retarded, anyone cheating isnt going to say anything xD
[5:46:32] iBanEvader: the opposite is true mostly, if it's possible to cheat people WILL cheat @StaysafeTV
[5:46:37] Fuzzywuggums: what if i dont have an ID because im too dumb to find a dmv?
[5:46:41] mint358: who’s cheating more is the question
[5:46:42] sound_wayv: they were aware of repeat ballots and discounted them, ie someone gets mailed a ballot but they go in to vote
[5:46:44] dtl78: we  should chip everyone and have them scan it as you're voting
[5:46:47] Xara36: bad channel to be in lol
[5:46:47] gajitron: lol
[5:46:56] sssyxxx: well, chatters, if you think there’s a way to remove all possible fraud from anything you are naïve af
[5:46:57] pottatowtv: Yeah I have a similar experience in PA. The lady just check signatures read my name wrong twice. I remember thinking that we definitely should have voter ID.
[5:46:58] Sourr09: i used to hate politics until i came to your stream
[5:47:00] tjr2mental: can you show proof of it happening?  Republicans use it as an argument all the time but can not ever show proof of it happening.
[5:47:06] darkCloud43: how is the housing market in oregon?
[5:47:15] gajitron: politics same subject none one is satisfied
[5:47:25] sal_rl: 100%
[5:47:27] kingdulli: @fuzzywuggums then you’re too dumb to vote
[5:47:31] bone555: Tank meta?
[5:47:35] sssyxxx: for sure.
[5:47:36] Ericj1337: @sixpackchad my wife is Guatemalan and now a citizen. She does taxes for work. She literally makes more money than me and I make decent money. Her brother and sister are illegal technically but there is a way to work and they are paying taxes to our government. But for the average person crossing it takes time to get established and start paying taxes/doing it 'right"
[5:47:40] mint358: pro Busch lite lgbqt channel twitch prime
[5:47:44] sixpackchad: the problem with talking about politics in america today, is people can't even agree on the facts
[5:47:50] hauserdot: exactly do what you can
[5:47:52] sssyxxx: I’m just against absolutes is all
[5:47:54] cloudstrife543: @sixpackchad true
[5:48:03] hauserdot: don’t just roll over and take defeat
[5:48:14] dtl78: chip everyone problem mostly solved
[5:48:14] KCYON: 100 gallons let it end quickly Kappa
[5:48:31] tjr2mental: so long as trump doesn't win I am good. I hate em both, but one is a raping racist
[5:48:33] MC_WhiteNoiz: Nah, become a masochist, Then its win-win
[5:48:36] unscconnor2: @StaysafeTV have you ever seen the ex KGB defector video basically predicting what is going on in this country right now?
[5:48:39] sixpackchad: @Ericj1337 doing it right is not coming here illegally in the first place. can i get their address so i can report them to ICE?
[5:48:41] hauserdot: KEKInsane you have to even explain
[5:48:46] sssyxxx: lol yeah that’s a bit ridiculous
[5:48:47] TurboBased: @tjr2mental IMGONNACUM
[5:48:51] kingdulli: the problem is the nonstop 24/7 news cycle now
[5:48:53] xelm_: @unscconnor2 link it in dms
[5:49:01] MC_WhiteNoiz: @unscconnor2 I have
[5:49:02] cloudstrife543: monkaW
[5:49:03] grilled_chicken14: love listening to educated political discussion (of which there is not much) but hate talking about it myself mostly because people are very stubborn in their current thought process and feels like I’m wasting my breath.
[5:49:18] mint358: media is the issue to much bullshit
[5:49:19] Dreako00: @tjr2mental Biden is a pedo
[5:49:32] sixpackchad: @mint358 that's why you gotta watch alternative media my man
[5:49:34] bots_bots: "AP Reporters went looking for cases of voter fraud in six states that Trump has challenged, and they found fewer than 475 potential instances out of more than 25 million votes cast" 475/25,000,000 = .0019% assuming you trust the AP journalists (do you have a good reason not to?) voter fraud is extremely rare
[5:49:47] grilled_chicken14: For sure time and place needs to be right
[5:49:47] KCYON: some stubborn people can open up over repeated discussions across YEARS of discourse. @grilled_chicken14 but generally i hear you
[5:49:59] numblezzz: some of my best friends are on the far right and some are on the left, we healthily debate and disagree. its about mutual respect
[5:50:01] Sourr09: too many people are just hard closed minded
[5:50:06] muffinguns: @bots_bots AP KEKW
[5:50:09] KCYON: so, sometimes its worth it to keep talking
[5:50:12] hauserdot: you can try to educate
[5:50:13] sal_rl: My sister is so woke washed she is gone, I've tried so many times to make her see the logic but she is hard stuck and committed to being a racist
[5:50:13] xelm_: without getting upset. rational discussion
[5:50:22] TurboBased: often you wont even see the seed you plant sprout
[5:50:26] MC_WhiteNoiz: @bots_bots And many times it's in Trumps favor lol
[5:50:34] harvenius: no :)
[5:50:34] sixpackchad: @StaysafeTV one time my sister was talking about trump and said he was a racist. i asked her to provide some evidence. she showed me some clip on MSNBC of trump saying non-racist things as proof.
[5:50:35] harvenius: im natty
[5:50:36] AintFinnaSubscribe: @sal_rl who is she racist against
[5:50:39] mint358: I mean it’s easy what does grilled chicken think let’s talk about it
[5:50:43] numblezzz: i used to be a giga lib, i got redpilled by conservatives engaging in healthy debate
[5:50:43] mrmagoo2: voting parses would make democracy pop off
[5:50:44] pisketti: the overton window moves one individual at a time NODDERS
[5:50:52] bahsingha: absolutly 100000%
[5:50:52] artilectXLII: ....yes 💯 "rhetoric" is super powerful... that is why advertising works; too well
[5:50:55] naughtiemares: Dust to dust.....
[5:50:58] sal_rl: @AintFinnaSubscribe Whites and rights lol
[5:51:00] kingdulli: @aintfinnasubscribe well if she’s a hard left list then she’s racist against whites.
[5:51:03] cyonara74: @StaysafeTV why are democrats so fascist?
[5:51:05] cloudstrife543: i could never convince my sister in law lol
[5:51:08] Sourr09: I BELIEVE THIS TIME
[5:51:08] NutterCircus: Waiting for that 1 guy.
[5:51:12] chatgpttwitchbot: @StaysafeTV  except popular vote doesnt matter only the electoral college votes matter and they dont always line up
[5:51:21] ruugla: The problem with that is most people aren't actually listening to a contrasting point of view, they are just waiting for their turn to talk.
[5:51:21] sargent_baddy: Currently prequesting someone kill me
[5:51:23] hauserdot: the problem is they voted for Biden thinking it was a good idea to begin with. without doing any of their research
[5:51:31] naughtiemares: I buy consumes for everyone for this fight
[5:51:31] hauserdot: and it was rigged
[5:51:31] R3ga1: :)
[5:51:33] tjr2mental: here is a talking point. what good does the republican party server the average American?  I mean, they are no longer the party of fiscal responsibility.  They continue to hurt their own voters.
[5:51:34] bots_bots: not always
[5:51:36] mint358: that’s not true lol
[5:51:36] Xara36: 50 popular votes
[5:51:37] bots_bots: but yes
[5:51:37] TurboBased: Pepega
[5:51:39] sound_wayv: county-wide not state
[5:51:40] R3ga1: Winner take all who wins the districts
[5:51:40] sixpackchad: @c0keg4ming if we elected based on popular vote strictly, NYC and LA would choose who our president is
[5:51:40] artilectXLII: ...learn to hypnotize others & win @ life 💯 guaranteed EZ
[5:51:40] naughtiemares: FAPs for melee are vital
[5:51:42] Xara36: its not 1 popular vote
[5:51:42] Kappadonna123: electoral high school
[5:51:44] Xara36: 50 of them
[5:51:53] numblezzz: @ruugla yeah thats pretty common among most people, regardless of their views. its good to try when u can tho
[5:51:56] kingdulli: @staysafetv what’s the reasoning for calling elections when only 20% of the votes are counted?
[5:51:58] naughtiemares: I really love tank warlocks though
[5:52:02] hauserdot: trump would’ve won but they cheated
[5:52:02] heylowdub: this gotta be the most kkona true farm stream on twitch XD
[5:52:03] naughtiemares: Next to shammy tanks
[5:52:10] cloudstrife543: trump only lost by like 70k votes split among 3 states
[5:52:18] ronnieglass: because nikki haley sucks
[5:52:21] Xara36: @cloudstrife543 "lost"
[5:52:27] AintFinnaSubscribe: @sal_rl yeah you can't really deconstruct somebody like that, if they are smart they will figure it out themselves eventually
[5:52:28] hauserdot: @cloudstrife543 yeah they one hundred percent cheated it was obvious
[5:52:39] sound_wayv: "calling" elections isnt official, all votes are still counted
[5:52:39] MC_WhiteNoiz: Isn't it county? based not total vote
[5:52:40] naughtiemares: Last election was not to be trusted
[5:52:42] Snaketrap: SCHIZO
[5:52:48] naughtiemares: Theres no fucking way that was legit
[5:52:55] numblezzz: the founding fathers never intended things to be based on popular vote. they wanted local communities to elect their smartest people who could then vote
[5:53:07] tjr2mental: perfect point is gop pulling funding from internet for poor homes.
[5:53:07] hauserdot: even Russian text books have it correct.
[5:53:12] sound_wayv: @naughtiemares why?
[5:53:16] caltex88: Anyone who understands statistics knows its fine.
[5:53:20] KCYON: i think we've seen examples of clear unfairness on both sides, democrat and republican (arguably Bernie and Trump)
[5:53:21] basedlamarck: this is essentially what happened in 2000 in Florida when the media called for Gore while the pans handle was still voting
[5:53:30] gajitron: Obama 2024
[5:53:30] MC_WhiteNoiz: They have voting models and get really into it like betting
[5:53:31] heylowdub: they dont post any results until poll stations are closed
[5:53:33] naughtiemares: @sound_wayv Everything about mail in votes just doesn't feel right to me
[5:53:35] Dewqt: deep state is also schizo
[5:53:37] tjr2mental: that is how hillary lost
[5:53:38] Kappadonna123: Biden wasnt even in the race until SC when he ran was he? Maybe he joined in NV but after he got the homie in SC to vouch for him it was over
[5:53:41] naughtiemares: Thats the only reason I don't trust it
[5:53:43] mint358: you should do a poll and see who is who just so we know who to trust lololol
[5:53:50] unscconnor2: @KCYON democrats where the ones that did bernie wrong. not republicans
[5:53:50] naughtiemares: No staff sadge
[5:53:52] sound_wayv: @naughtiemares lol
[5:53:53] sal_rl: @AintFinnaSubscribe Yeah I just stopped trying the 4th or 5th time of different discussions getting her upset and blaming it on white people and or men, she is totally lost and wants 10 year olds to get mutilated
[5:53:56] naughtiemares: Ive only ever seen one staff
[5:54:02] mint358: I don’t trust any politician
[5:54:11] KCYON: @unscconnor2 ohh okay, didnt know
[5:54:11] MC_WhiteNoiz: Sounds like a voter issue
[5:54:34] numblezzz: @sal_rl ideologues that are that brainwashed can no longer be engaged with. just take solace knowing 95% of people are rational
[5:54:42] unscconnor2: @KCYON Hillary and the DNC chair woman had an under the table deal done in 2016
[5:54:48] Xara36: mail in voting is a scam.  Think about it, i have a family of 5, say my kids are all over 18 and none of them care about politics.  I effectively get 5 votes, i could easily fill them all out and say sign here and be done
[5:54:56] Wingsofjanitor: The Staysafe Agenda monkaX
[5:55:07] naughtiemares: Staysafe agenda monkaW
[5:55:09] ronnieglass: vivick
[5:55:12] mint358: if you like killing baby’s well… I don’t like you
[5:55:15] Vehicle_King: If people actually took the time to see which politicians actually agree with their main convictions neither Trump nor Biden would win. Or be a candidate.
[5:55:17] Xara36: thats happening now, but at like an apartment complex in nyc, 500 people dont care, 1 activists knocks on doors and gets 300 of them to fill them out and drops them off in the mail for them
[5:55:17] kingdulli: @xara36 don’t forget your family members that have passed as well they count in democrats eyes.
[5:55:34] artilectXLII: ...politicians are actors who were to ugly for Hollywood 😬 ...& they are owned or black-mailed; they will not save anyone
[5:55:35] dtl78: at least
[5:55:37] naughtiemares: I didn't think it was horrible that Trump lost, I mean it obviously was at this point. Biden has done fuck all
[5:55:45] sound_wayv: whats everyones thoughts on trump's VP pick?
[5:55:45] naughtiemares: Just a terrible administration
[5:55:47] AintFinnaSubscribe: @sal_rl I have family members like that and a sister but she got over it eventually it was more of a phase I didn't convince her of anything
[5:55:48] Kappadonna123: but its not a scam bc everyone has the same chance to mail in vote right?
[5:55:52] KCYON: @unscconnor2 its human nature unfortunately; i would expect no less even at that level. e.g. getting a buddy a job versus a more qualified candidate
[5:55:59] numblezzz: reagan was pretty handsome
[5:56:10] TheDastardlyD: wild to think how many politicians are blackmailed
[5:56:14] Kappadonna123: are they only allowing certain ppl to mail in vote?
[5:56:22] sal_rl: @AintFinnaSubscribe I never even tried to convince, I just ask logical questions and she always gets mad
[5:56:23] LegendFromWoW: Trump was a good president.
[5:56:25] kingdulli: @kappadonna123 yeah the dead and black people
[5:56:32] xelm_: Trump best
[5:56:47] artilectXLII: ...yes, but only the black-mailed person can become POTUS
[5:56:52] MC_WhiteNoiz: People are mad about trump, but I think the bigger issue is that people have such low standards he was even allowed around politics. We deserve better. Left and Right
[5:56:53] cloudstrife543: @sound_wayv he should pick sarah palin probably
[5:56:59] hauserdot: like the deliberate systematic destruction of the entire country
[5:57:00] unscconnor2: They are predicting 13 million illegals crossing by the end of Bidens first term. That is fucking insane. Higher than any president ever
[5:57:02] kingdulli: texas super based constructing walls despite the retarded admin
[5:57:09] numblezzz: to be a politician is to be someone that seeks power and wants to impose their beliefs on others. all politicians are evil YEP
[5:57:10] chiief: you think we should have less immigrants total?
[5:57:15] naughtiemares: Yes
[5:57:26] naughtiemares: We should atleast be able to control and regulate
[5:57:27] hauserdot: ICANT
[5:57:35] dtl78: still from the same Jesuit scum
[5:57:40] naughtiemares: Shit is completely out of control right now
[5:57:41] sal_rl: how about 0 illegals
[5:57:41] sound_wayv: i wanna see tucker carlson for the VP pick, lets see how crazy we can take this shit
[5:57:42] naughtiemares: And has been
[5:57:44] KCYON: How are labour jobs in america?  e.g. farming. the jobs Americans wouldn't do
[5:57:48] TheDastardlyD: help the people inside before we take on anyone else's problems
[5:57:50] ronnieglass: we cant even take care of our own so lets not take in more?
[5:58:01] Dreako00: China and Russia are using immigrants as a weapon.
[5:58:05] MC_WhiteNoiz: What do you think changed to allow more crossings? Were the same amount of travelers showing up?
[5:58:12] hauserdot: also deport as many illegals as possible
[5:58:12] serg1592: serg1592 subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 15 months! 
[5:58:14] Kappadonna123: heres a hot take. we arent the united states anymore. we are under CIA control and have been since JFK got assassinated.
[5:58:22] Vehicle_King: Neither side wants to enforce already on the books legislation with regards to the Southern Border. Ask yourself why.
[5:58:23] HandsomeCage: What about farm hands?
[5:58:26] Dreako00: Finland had to shut down their border because Russia flooded them. All of a sudden africans were crossing it on bikes
[5:58:29] kingdulli: @kappadonna123 FBI open up!
[5:58:31] Milanesa_De_Pollo: What about boats full of 100s of men ages 20-50?

[5:58:34] hauserdot: @kappadonna123 YEP
[5:58:34] KCYON: it would happen more if you close the border
[5:58:36] tjr2mental: who is working the farms and doing their labor?   it is back breaking work that americans do not want to do for the low pay it allows.
[5:58:40] Jimbo_Slice093: Its great having a dementia patient in office
[5:58:40] chiief: Capitalism wouldn't allow it - we have too many dying and declining birth rate
[5:58:45] naughtiemares: @Kappadonna123 Stay where you are
[5:58:48] MC_WhiteNoiz: Not all borders?
[5:58:52] TheDastardlyD: we don't need an imported slave class to do menial labor which pays dirt
[5:58:56] KCYON: I dont think agriculture could survive without immigrants in US. in fact im almost certain
[5:58:57] dtl78: yeah but profit margins are more important Kappa
[5:59:01] mint358: I’ve been very productive now that Busch light is off the table
[5:59:02] Vehicle_King: Its companies being cheap and hiring cheaper labor.

[5:59:21] Kappadonna123: skin color = skill doe
[5:59:23] Wrettchh: troof
[5:59:28] Xara36: oh democrats sued elon for that remember that lol
[5:59:32] mint358: no wow no Busch lite man I’ve made an extra 50 grand
[5:59:33] numblezzz: @KCYON i disagree with this narrative. wages for farmhands has only dropped due to migrants - without them, they would rise and locals would do the job
[5:59:34] KCYON: i can't see a normal american dude who plays wow in the farms picking fruit lool
[5:59:34] Zezlo: well its because those illegal immigrants will work for far less money
[5:59:41] pizac7: smooth when the rogue isn't doing 12 dps
[5:59:42] naughtiemares: The 2h Pog
[5:59:43] Vehicle_King: Businesses love having workers on Visas that they can manipulate and control and threaten with deportation. helps drive down their labor costs
[5:59:46] naughtiemares: I got that my first run
[5:59:46] Lionkingler1: EZ 95
[5:59:49] naughtiemares: It was so lucky
[5:59:50] Obiwoncanoli: Americans are lazy. you couldnt even get TB world buff
[5:59:51] pottatowtv: Hunter Weapon
[5:59:51] Fuzzywuggums: @StaysafeTV companies will post jobs with low salaries, then complain they cant find someone to fill the job and use that to justify an h1b visa instead of just paying a decent american wage
[5:59:51] cyonara74: hunter weapon
[5:59:54] serg1592: thanks for the shoutout man keep up the good streams <3
[5:59:55] hauserdot: @kappadonna123 and they would do the same to trump. they will use martial law and fake internet and server attacks. or just straight up Assass. like they did to JFK
[5:59:57] unscconnor2: Boeing is a prime example of the failures of DEI right now. Another malfunction with a Boeing plane here in Atlanta today.
[6:00:03] caltex88: Markets always clear. It's not a question of if they will clear, it's a question of at what price will they clear
[6:00:07] smurrflounge: they pay no taxes
[6:00:07] cgilb14: that’d look good on you
[6:00:10] DaddySmelly: @staysafetv H1B visas are a scam. Companies are listing highly skilled jobs for $15 an hour, using the lack of applications as evidence they need more foreign workers
[6:00:14] KCYON: @numblezzz maybe. i'd like to see a concrete example before assuming americans could take up that role (e.g. a State does what you're suggesting)
[6:00:39] cyonara74: @StaysafeTV Democrat's sure do love their slave class
[6:00:39] MC_WhiteNoiz: So why do you think the capitalist companies want people from outside the US?
[6:00:42] LegendFromWoW: Real talk man.
[6:00:46] Kappadonna123: immigration is racist
[6:00:47] ben_mdlol: When are you running for President?
[6:00:47] TheDastardlyD: I know people that would do farm work if it wasn'
[6:00:49] smurrflounge: technology would develop to remove the # of workers, it incentives companies to innovate
[6:00:54] TheDastardlyD: t payed fucking nothing
[6:00:57] Vehicle_King: @unscconnor2 No, Boeing is a prime example of why you dont want MBAs running your business. They dont know jack shit about tech or engineering and are cutting costs everywhere to get bigger bonuses for themselves. Dont fall for the fake culture was BS....
[6:00:59] harvenius: yay capitalism
[6:01:00] cyonara74: @StaysafeTV I'll pick oranges for $150 an hour
[6:01:02] mint358: @daddysmelly no skilled worker is working for 15$ an hour lol wtf do you called skilled
[6:01:03] KCYON: oh yeah AI makes farmers irrelevant lool forgot
[6:01:03] xelm_: makes sense as to why housing & basic everyday things in life are un-affordable
[6:01:04] KCYON: nvm
[6:01:07] cgc11: When did we not have waves of immigrants?
[6:01:08] Obiwoncanoli: 50 years ago, americans werent at home playing WoW
[6:01:11] Snaketrap: YEP good for that GDP tho
[6:01:17] notjyordan: you really can't compare those dates to todays dates since the property market has sky rocketed since
[6:01:19] caltex88: Markets are heavily distorted by it. Some products may not be vialble, others would be. Some things might be more expensive, etc.
[6:01:20] hauserdot: there’s too many people
[6:01:20] MC_WhiteNoiz: Milk would be $20 lol
[6:01:20] cgc11: Chinese, irish, its history repeating itself
[6:01:23] tjr2mental: I like your point, but I just do not see it working today. companies will always do what is best for the company.
[6:01:23] plddn: everything cost way les back then yea even 20years
[6:01:23] rocknsake: this shit has been going on since the 1800s.  chinese immigrant labor in san francisco and the irish who hated them for taking their jobs
[6:01:24] K4HLER: THOUGHTS ON THE DEATH PENALTY?
[6:01:25] deezyjc: how many billionaires existed back then
[6:01:31] notjyordan: and you can't say that's because of immigrants
[6:01:39] harvenius: boomer golden era
[6:01:40] Zaziben: decent wage isn
[6:01:42] sound_wayv: overpopulation
[6:01:45] Snaketrap: YEP but my happiness is directly tied to how big the US GDP number is
[6:01:45] KCYON: people are different now
[6:01:47] kingdulli: @hauserdot no there’s too many people in certain areas. look at the vast areas of uninhabited land
[6:01:52] mint358: I’ll higher anyone in the channel at 23$ an hour plus benefits
[6:01:55] bahsingha: again absolutly my words :O 100% agree
[6:01:55] Zaziben: a decent wage isnt even that much either
[6:01:58] Sourr09: @notmooj bro...
[6:02:00] Vehicle_King: Because rest of the world was recovering from world wars. Then globalization.
[6:02:02] xelm_: makes sense as to why housing & basic everyday things in life are un-affordable 󠀀
[6:02:02] mint358: in fucking Kentucky
[6:02:03] Zezlo: immigrants basically take over the jobs of teenagers / low skill jobs
[6:02:03] AintFinnaSubscribe: @hauserdot Global population is estimated to start decreasing by 2040, China is in a decline and India is below replacement level
[6:02:03] numblezzz: this can also be extrapolated to the death of american factories. the middle class was built off american factory workers making decent wage
[6:02:04] caltex88: @tjr2mental If the king does not take the reigns of power, the merchants will. You simply do not give them the choice.
[6:02:12] smurrflounge: on the pearl
[6:02:31] notmooj: i dont have it i just won
[6:02:32] Snaketrap: flushE
[6:02:52] smurrflounge: lol mooj is in here

[6:02:54] tjr2mental: worst trrime for a commercial
[6:02:55] tjr2mental: lol
[6:02:56] MC_WhiteNoiz: It wasn't immigration it was the suffragette movement doubling the American work force overnight and making every household a potential dual income earner increasing housing prices.
[6:02:57] AceOfFlame: @StaysafeTV Do you believe when trumps says that WW3 is starting to happen?

[7:30:29] Dethkar_tv: I was an alcoholic 9 years and I quit drinking last March. since then I’ve been really struggling to find happiness naturally.
[7:30:37] savixlikesitfrombehind: @raggimagga You never been here before i can see he says this a joke dumbo
[7:30:37] haggardwisdom: agree, ive done weed and harder shit beginning with 14 and it fucked my sober life nowadays totally up
[7:30:41] shoehorn_oh_plenty: maybe thier happiness was already stolen
[7:30:42] infuze27: weed doesnt damage my life
[7:30:44] infuze27: ;)
[7:30:49] friendlyboon: Lol caffeine and drugs are two different things 😂
[7:30:55] Playermodd: here comes all the pot heads defending weed lol
[7:30:56] Somra: weed with moderation is fine
[7:31:07] Kuukenstein: good answer
[7:31:10] Numidia: Staysafe my biggest beef with you is that you still havent watched wille's latest video
[7:31:11] BallisticBanzai: whats wrong with a man smoking a J after a hard days work?
[7:31:12] TurboBased: your morning coffee isnt gone fuck your life up KEKW

[7:31:36] raggimagga: @savixlikesitfrombehind lol?
[7:31:45] Somra: breathing air is addictive trickyyTeehee
[7:31:52] haggardwisdom: weed in moderation can be ok when you are like 21+ and alrdy learned how to live a productive life
[7:32:04] iknowido: bottom line: why risk fucking up your life?
[7:32:05] friendlyboon: I think common sense
[7:32:05] pottatowtv: Why do Pot heads always act like Coffee is the same as Weed?
[7:32:07] friendlyboon: 😂
[7:32:09] MC_WhiteNoiz: I have a really bad caffeine addiction, I drink 1-2 energy drinks a day and it helps me avoid a lot of my physical and mental ailments but keeps me from working on my impulse control.
[7:32:15] Playermodd: holy copium these pot heads are saying right now in chat
[7:32:33] MC_WhiteNoiz: Obviously that's not the case for everyone with caffeine
[7:32:49] algresh: sugar would be a good example, in excess could cause a lot of problems
[7:33:27] PieceOfPanic: NGL - Don't do drugs.
[7:33:28] infuze27: nope
[7:33:33] Playermodd: your streaming to major pot heads that play wow all day lmao
[7:33:35] botch19: How do you know if you've never smoked

[7:33:55] Dabtronaut: Coming from someone who smokes every day you're pretty correct on that one @StaysafeTV
[7:33:59] shoehorn_oh_plenty: depends on the mind but weed def creeps up on ppl
[7:34:15] botch19: Takes steroids but is afraid of weed...
[7:34:16] infuze27: depends on how many mg of caff u takin too i guess
[7:34:18] MC_WhiteNoiz: I could quit weed easy, after smoking every day for a year. I have not been able to kick caffeine since highschool when they would bring us free red bull
[7:34:20] AintFinnaSubscribe: Weed changes peoples behaviour, short temper, aggressive, no patience etc
[7:34:21] Ericj1337: No. I work 12 hours a day and only smoke at night time for sleep
[7:34:21] friendlyboon: Weed fucks your life up pretty hard ngl.
[7:34:24] PieceOfPanic: Even if you are suffering any physical or metal effects from drugs, it'll still harm you socially. Just don't do it.
[7:34:24] donkeebrainz: @wizzleboom87 he says not to take steroids
[7:34:35] PieceOfPanic: aren't*
[7:34:36] i_oracle: I quit weed 10 months ago after smoking for 17 years and life is 100 times better without being high 24/7 depending on getting high for happiness is awful
[7:34:36] donkeebrainz: fucking donut
[7:34:39] Steebadin: So many ads, I miss the conversation :(
[7:34:42] kelethin_bank: kelethin_bank subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 44 months! the pothead cope is always next level.
[7:34:55] PieceOfPanic: 100% fair
[7:34:56] gororororoo: xanax is even worse and so many people think its ok
[7:35:00] infuze27: more than fair
[7:35:02] gororororoo: barheads are zombies
[7:35:08] MC_WhiteNoiz: Absolutely
[7:35:13] PieceOfPanic: NODDERS
[7:35:13] sargent_baddy: nah pros definitely outweigh the cons for me
[7:35:19] sixpackchad: @StaysafeTV every night (usually after 8pm) i take .5mg of edibles that are prescribed to me. do i classify as a bong brain? i never smoke it.
[7:35:20] sargent_baddy: but its different for everyone
[7:35:27] botch19: Sugar is a drug
[7:35:32] xsnackjesusx: you have to be over 16 to buy energy drinks in the UK
[7:35:37] MC_WhiteNoiz: yeah I don't understand that
[7:35:38] PieceOfPanic: I'm caffeine addicted today, through coca cola.
[7:35:40] TurboBased: gross
[7:35:41] iknowido: i had coffee with breakfast as a kid lol
[7:35:47] PieceOfPanic: it's horrible
[7:35:48] Somra: I mean what's the context
[7:35:49] shoehorn_oh_plenty: USA USA USA
[7:35:54] granais: Coke needs to be treated like a dessert
[7:35:55] spy_bones: that was me and now I've had a lifelong struggle with caffiene addiction
[7:35:57] PieceOfPanic: and sugar, probably
[7:35:57] Somra: is it a birthday?
[7:36:00] Piorum_: energy drinks fucked me, I'd 100% call it an addiction
[7:36:03] TurboBased: HUH
[7:36:05] HeyItsBlumpers: most my parents ever let me have was lemonade
[7:36:05] kingdulli: #remembermooj
[7:36:08] rocknsake: the high fructose corn syrup is arguably worse than the caffeine
[7:36:08] MC_WhiteNoiz: @Piorum_ Same <3
[7:36:09] handlights: I was just telling my 2 year old at dinner that coca cola is poison and mommy drinks it because shes an addict lol
[7:36:09] Plathyy: lmao
[7:36:12] Peoplewhinetoomuch: I started drinking coffee at 12, made me run faster
[7:36:16] Jon_GamesTV: a diabetic child needing sugar
[7:36:17] redd123455: what if the 3 year old is out with the boys?
[7:36:22] gororororoo: sugar in general is just terrible for children
[7:36:22] TurboBased: Tell me you dont have kids without telling me
[7:36:25] sothis666: COKE FLOAT Madge
[7:36:26] bone555: Why are americans so fat???
[7:36:30] vash61: even Juneteenth? huh
[7:36:30] spy_bones: @redd123455 you have a point
[7:36:32] PieceOfPanic: @avengedsyn Sad but true
[7:36:33] flawless_jv: Yea when i was 14 i drank a SHIT TON of Monster drinks when playing WoW lol thanks god i dont drink that shit anymore
[7:36:34] kingdulli: mexican coke is fine tho
[7:36:34] HeyItsBlumpers: even yom kippur??? D:
[7:36:39] Ericj1337: Juice has crazy sugar also
[7:36:40] MC_WhiteNoiz: What if that 3 year old has a job and a 401k with a home and family
[7:36:40] haggardwisdom: the big question is why there are no regulations for stuff like that
[7:36:46] kingdulli: @flawless_jv same. got to 300 lb. was a rough time
[7:36:47] wolfemanxd: We had a sailor pass away on our ship when I was in the Navy from taking to many Stacker energy pills.
[7:36:47] harvenius: the 3 year old needs the caffeine for their max weight deadlift tho
[7:37:00] flawless_jv: @kingdulli yea not good
[7:37:02] Somra: shiryShrug I don't see the harm in a can of coke on your birthday, but that's just me
[7:37:15] friendlyboon: Because you don't just have it on your birthday
[7:37:21] xsnackjesusx: @STREAMSNIPELUL thats a hell of a leap lol
[7:37:23] kingdulli: you hear about the retards drinking the over caffeinated drinks at panera and filing lawsuits
[7:37:25] Ramblob: what do you get from getting maxed out in warsong rep
[7:37:25] Playermodd: should have rolled alliance

[7:37:40] infuze27: is it true mrstaysafe? ur quitting mcdonalds?
[7:37:44] Adubington: theyre delicious
[7:37:46] TheDastardlyD: two people died apparently
[7:37:47] weouthere365: people died
[7:37:51] sargent_baddy: some guy drank like 8 and died
[7:37:54] MC_WhiteNoiz: I worked there, it's awful
[7:37:56] PieceOfPanic: @Somra I mean, It's not the individual can that's a problem. Kids don't have impulse control, and will chose the sugar/caffinated product every time.
[7:37:59] helmetnach0s: supercharged lemonade
[7:38:01] handlights: and they make $30 hospital food
[7:38:03] iknowido: who the fuck goes to panerra?
[7:38:10] infuze27: :O
[7:38:15] flawless_jv: ive never had panera bread lol
[7:38:16] kingdulli: panera is trash
[7:38:17] HepzibahD2: whoever said that hasnt been to my job
[7:38:29] bbdak502: Mr Staysafe do you ever go to Cafe Rio?
[7:38:31] VinoHuncho: not eating McDonald’s is unamerican
[7:38:44] MC_WhiteNoiz: I like Cafe Yumm
[7:38:46] PieceOfPanic: @Somra Because generally, I agree. It's not a problem, but the moment u take away the parenting control, u'll have kids who'll choose it every time.
[7:38:48] friendlyboon: Yeah the second you stop drinking soda/going out to any fast food that isn't like good and healthy etc, your life is 100% better
[7:39:05] terlet_terwilliger: Chick-fil-a for the politics more than the food LULW
[7:39:07] Somra: @PieceOfPanic well at that age, I wouldn't give them the cola all the time, but on a birthday maybe
[7:39:09] kingdulli: replace soda with any juice cut with seltzer
[7:39:14] Playermodd: that includes not playing wow 16 hours a day
[7:39:16] Somra: trickyyNodders
[7:39:25] PieceOfPanic: Exactly
[7:39:42] Playermodd: people have 10 lvl 25 alts
[7:39:56] kodder12: I took LSD once in my life, and it actually changed my life for the better
[7:39:57] krispxxy: how do you feel about world of warcraft addiction lmao
[7:40:03] Humansoup: Very True
[7:40:03] shoehorn_oh_plenty: heroin saved my life
[7:40:06] pottatowtv: For sure
[7:40:06] helmetnach0s: YO THATS BS
[7:40:07] xezykk: fuck weed indeed
[7:40:15] spy_bones: agreed I had to quit to get my shit together
[7:40:19] Zaediex: What about alcohol?
[7:40:19] dasdeemster: as a 32 year old male that has smoked for 15+ years, your take is 100% accurate
[7:40:21] fanniclap: Relying on anything is bad
[7:40:22] kingdulli: weed is making people lazier and fatter than ever.
[7:40:34] friendlyboon: Yeah, weed and alcohol
[7:40:46] PieceOfPanic: Alchohol is crazy
[7:40:46] gororororoo: i dont see how its any different than drinking in moderation
[7:40:50] terlet_terwilliger: and jerking it
[7:40:51] helmetnach0s: alcohol is honestly really bad
[7:40:52] dasdeemster: not enough education on substance use, its a problem.
[7:40:53] Vehicle_King: But if cures my Glaucoma KEKL
[7:40:56] ScarfaceCEO: Young men still have developing brains, not a good thing to smoke pot.
[7:40:57] Ericj1337: I work 12hrs and only smoke before bed. How is that harming anyone
[7:40:57] friendlyboon: I'd say weed is worse just because it's so easy to get/cheaper/not as obviously bad
[7:40:58] krispxxy: Alcohol and cocaine is a great mix
[7:40:59] rwaith227: i drink 6 coffee a day and feel like shit but it's been part of my life for 34 yrs
[7:41:00] redd123455: @StaysafeTV don't you have a burning desire to get messed up with the boys?
[7:41:00] vash61: gen z doesn’t drink nearly as much as previous gens
[7:41:01] kingdulli: @dasdeemster DARE
[7:41:02] gororororoo: people need to police themselves and be disciplined with drugs
[7:41:05] crumbler81: wait...how do you piss off weed users? They're so chill and laid back KEKW
[7:41:17] kingdulli: @vash61 no but the marijuana consumption is skyrocketing
[7:41:17] sl1nky1981: Alcohol is just poison
[7:41:19] hxyfever: im almost at 2 months
[7:41:22] cjadude: true as fuck
[7:41:28] PieceOfPanic: @sl1nky1981 Basically, yea.
[7:41:29] helmetnach0s: As a whole to society, I would say alcohol is worse
[7:41:31] roxt4: I’ve been doing dry January for alcohol.
[7:41:32] Zaediex: Good to be substance free for sure.
[7:41:34] vash61: @kingdulli no doubt
[7:41:46] Vehicle_King: Dang almost like everything America pushes on you is bad for you. monkaHmm
[7:41:47] dasdeemster: @gororororoo 100% the issue is you learn how to do that as a teen. weed/substances fuck up that process.
[7:42:01] algresh: alcohol is great until you get pancreatic cancer
[7:42:03] dontbecold: D:
[7:42:09] Zaediex: I wasn't trying to dig.
[7:42:12] MC_WhiteNoiz: People don't like being judged or told what to do
[7:42:13] PieceOfPanic: One thing doesn't justify another
[7:42:14] Playermodd: 90% of your viewers smoke weed and play wow all day so yeah
[7:42:14] TurboBased: Peggers but you play a video game
[7:42:14] NullumDominus: whataboutism
[7:42:22] PieceOfPanic: LUL
[7:42:23] Zaediex: They're both bad, but it's a continuum I think.
[7:42:23] yaro7i: you tell them: fuck yeah I chew power gum the best caffienated gum on the market
[7:42:25] sl1nky1981: I haven't had alcohol in 12 years. I sometimes miss the taste of a nice cold beer but the effects aren't worth it.
[7:42:26] Wingsofjanitor: the end of Power Gum PepeHands
[7:42:29] helmetnach0s: dont talk to me until i've had my coffee!
[7:42:32] ZetherTV: lol true
[7:42:33] gororororoo: weed is def worse because theres so many people saying its harmless... only for that reason. alcohol is objectively worse for the body
[7:42:36] re5onxnce: what about protein
[7:42:36] plddn: tea !

[7:42:58] Vehicle_King: My local bar jacked up their prices 40% during covid, so I stopped drinking unless it's a special occasion
[7:43:15] PieceOfPanic: LUL

[7:43:58] Taicho116: Sounds like classic case of waterfall addiction imo
[7:44:14] cflexx1: 320 ELE SHAM
[7:44:17] algresh: The mere definition of some substance as a drug is not enough to affirm anything in general, the fact that coffee is a drug doesnt say much
[7:44:18] gororororoo: @scumbagx then youve never seen a real homeless alcoholic. some people drink hand sanitizer dude
[7:44:24] Zaediex: @Taicho116 don't got chasin waterfalls. :D

[7:45:06] xsnackjesusx: @gororororoo you had me so confused for a second there lol
[7:45:20] MC_WhiteNoiz: It's because you're putting your opinion onto others. And they are defending.
[7:45:43] Zaediex: It's a continuum tho. They're not all the same. It's all about how far down the rabbit hole it can send you.
[7:46:01] naughtiemares: "Anything that changes the body chemistry" retards
[7:46:03] Zaediex: I mean, people crush Monsters all day long too. That's not good.
[7:46:07] Zaediex: It's not heroin tho.
[7:46:09] Ghostauren: Does WoW count as a drug if I am addicted to it though? pupperE
[7:46:48] NightMunchies: WARCRAFT'S ADDICTIVE LOL

[7:46:58] Playermodd: weed smoking wow gamers are in shambles right now
