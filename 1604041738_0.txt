[7:02:13] xMika1: just dont get the issues 4Head
[7:02:33] StarwalkerZah: jake same thing happens to me i can tell you exactly. 1- a chair with a full back where you can lay back comfortably and head can rest. 2- arms even with arm rest and keyboard (a keyboard pull out can help get your mouse and keyboard in a better position). 3- less important but helpful if feet can also be flat and comfortable then basically perfect ergonomics (foot rest can help with this).
[7:03:16] xMika1: we going into chair sci fi here
[7:03:23] Crushzilla: do you have a good pillow? i used shit ass walmart pillows for over 30 years. getting a proper good pillow makes a world of difference

[7:07:21] Knoives: is berry twitch korea
[7:07:36] Knoives: NOOOO
[7:07:52] Crushzilla: probably has something to do with their ISP shit going on. they want content providers to pay for using their networks to provide content
[7:08:20] xMika1: Corporations PainChamp
[7:08:40] Knoives: @xMika1 maybe their data cost is higher than average
[7:08:55] xMika1: you mean they want more profit
[7:09:09] xMika1: if it wasnt a proble before how is it suddenly now
[7:09:51] Crushzilla: The planned revision to the Telecommunications Business Act -- also known as the ‘network usage fee’ bills -- would require global content providers to sign mandatory contracts with local Internet service providers such as KT and SK Broadband to standardize obligations to pay fees for using their networks.

[7:23:03] StarwalkerZah: @Crushzilla oh how does it screw consumers
[7:23:08] Crushzilla: did they remove world pvping? its felt like you haven't ever had to fight any alliance while leveling
[7:23:15] raalsy: war tank?
[7:23:19] braadleeyy: there's no alliance on faerlina basically

[7:26:55] StarwalkerZah: @Crushzilla heres where my thinking is, they want yt netflix twitch etc to pay them more money for korean users? so a negative im thinking is platforms block Korea?
[7:27:22] Steezbutter: you worked out at all since launch or no?
[7:27:33] shlimshlam: maybe do some pulling movements to balance out the pushups?
[7:27:34] Crushzilla: pretty much. might not be worth operating in Korea. they push a lot of bandwidth
[7:28:17] StarwalkerZah: @Crushzilla so is that the way it hurts consumers, they dont necessarily get charged for it but may get blocked from the services for the cost?
[7:32:49] golaki: chat wake up:O

[8:26:30] braadleeyy: yeah that'd probably be easier than using zygor, which bugged out for me
[8:26:39] braadleeyy: just use the attune addon. it lays it out linearly
