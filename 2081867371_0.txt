[0:51:11] spanish_late: no if u be alone who care what u weared ?! :D
[0:51:20] Thoreya: fancy
[0:51:53] Andersonmps: And its expensive
[0:51:55] venvictas: That makes sense you live in a country that takes it textile industry very serious.
[0:52:05] AlmightyWitchDoctor: Cashmere is made out of Goats native to the Gobi desert and Central Asia!
[0:52:39] venvictas: People will buy anything
[0:52:42] Zirconn__: my fatass keeps thinking about Kashmir chilli pepper and not a textile
[0:52:49] Zirconn__: not even the same spelling
[0:52:57] Andersonmps: The best option is not wear pants at all, at home
[0:53:23] Zirconn__: with that logic, we’d be streaming in kick Kappa
[0:53:58] torx10: when start s4 @chat ?
[0:54:05] Andersonmps: I'm afraid this pirate patch won't live up to expectations
[0:54:41] SerThunderbeans: @Zirconn__ Unironically more of that stuff on Twitch tho LUL
[0:54:51] spanish_late: im always alone and just wearing a Kurdish pants and enjoying weather when it goes into my pants :D
[0:54:55] Thoreya: @torx10 prob may, after alpha launches
[0:55:01] venvictas: Loro piana, brunello, Bottega Veneta, so many more ki d of obscure ultra high quality fashion designers in Italy.
[0:55:04] Mecharobhzilla: roti?

[0:55:09] Zirconn__: chapati
[0:55:20] venvictas: That's a food
[0:55:52] Zirconn__: the flour makes a huge difference
[0:55:55] venvictas: Roti is a food that is made in..... Trinidad I think.
[0:56:12] Zirconn__: I used to make it with regular for awhile then I tried it with whole wheat flour and it was amazkng
[0:56:17] Zirconn__: for roti/chapati specifically
[0:57:09] venvictas: Which would mean it's tradionally Indian.

[0:57:41] TotallyNotRaien: you talk alot about cooking for someone who eats 1.5 meals a day
[0:57:49] venvictas: If it's trinadian food it's spicy
[0:57:50] Zirconn__: I’m going to cook curry today
[0:58:01] Zirconn__: you’ve inspired me
[0:58:48] Andersonmps: hungry You're making me
[0:58:53] Mecharobhzilla: i love how every stream i watched recently everyone ends up talking about food!!!
[0:59:06] spanish_late: @Naguura Search Qorme sabzi and you will understand which food is so more delicous :P
[0:59:18] Zirconn__: you can buy naan, just heat it up on a pan for best flavor
[0:59:29] SerThunderbeans: Naan is flat, quick to make, and best when it's totally fresh
[0:59:55] SerThunderbeans: I wouldn't buy ready made Naan, it just doesn't compare to fresh
[0:59:56] Zirconn__: it generally doesn’t take more than 30m to make naan
[1:00:04] Mecharobhzilla: if you ask for the secret breaad recipe, you'll have to sign a naan disclosure agreement!! :D:D:D
[1:00:29] Zirconn__: well true I forgot about the yeast
[1:00:31] SerThunderbeans: yeah, they use yeast to give it a bit of those bubbles
[1:00:38] Zirconn__: it’s about an hour for it to rise
[1:00:39] TotallyNotRaien: does the bread mafia include naan or is it just italian bread
[1:00:49] nicklasdanskmand: BD Halal marked or bikhari @Naguura  in south tyrol
[1:00:50] nicklasdanskmand: has it
[1:00:52] nicklasdanskmand: for sure
[1:00:55] Zirconn__: there are no-yeast recipe but that’s up to you
[1:01:09] nicklasdanskmand: thats turkish / arabs shops
[1:01:10] venvictas: I just thought about something. Do you know Gunther Steiner?
[1:01:22] nicklasdanskmand: yes you do
[1:01:25] nicklasdanskmand: HAHA
[1:01:26] nicklasdanskmand: you do
[1:01:29] nicklasdanskmand: ahh
[1:01:37] Kuroz: south tyrol isn't that small
[1:01:45] Kuroz: she would have to drive 90 minutes probably
[1:01:55] nicklasdanskmand: bolanzo ?
[1:02:27] Zirconn__: asking if she knows Gunter Steiner is like asking an American if they know gene haas lol
[1:02:50] venvictas: Lol. I figured it wouldn't hurt to ask.
[1:03:13] Kuroz: hmmMeeting  there is a bd halal in Bolzano
[1:03:22] AceReformed: What is this sad lovesong music we are listening too
[1:03:34] Mecharobhzilla: i want pakora now!!!

[1:04:26] xFAME_BROWNIEx: why last day for tyrannical push?
[1:04:36] Kuroz: tomorrow -> fortified
[1:04:47] Zirconn__: common misconception that ALL Indian dishes are spicy
[1:05:05] venvictas: Is eating spicy food really an issue for some people?

[1:05:05] Zirconn__: it’s generally just down to individuals adjusting their own recipes
[1:05:29] Mecharobhzilla: i love spicy food but had a maccies mchicken fiery hot thing the other day and it made my tears spicy!! :(
[1:05:50] venvictas: I always thought when someone complains about food being spicy that they were just being dramatic.

[1:06:45] nicklasdanskmand: @Zirconn__ the pakistani versions are the spciy ones but people normally think pakistani food is indian
[1:06:57] Zirconn__: yep
[1:06:58] tsurghat: @venvictas the spicy food i eat without problems burns others peoples intestines
[1:07:01] fede_ren: That mage has severe lag
[1:07:02] Raggu2: i would consider indian food to be 'spicy" in the way that it typically contains a lot of spice not that its "hot"
[1:07:20] TotallyNotRaien: cuz youre dramatic
[1:07:28] spanish_late: Search Qorme sabzi Naguura
[1:07:31] Aegatron: why want it it to hurt when you eat something
[1:07:34] spanish_late: its so yummy
[1:07:35] StreamElements: For Highlights, fun content and guides, remember to subscribe to my youtube channel -> https://www.youtube.com/naguura
[1:07:42] AceReformed: I think spicey sometimes is fine, just sometimes, but not TOO spicey, it adds a bit of a kick
[1:07:42] Zirconn__: I agree that there are limits to heat
[1:07:45] SerThunderbeans: it is pleasant in the mouth when it hurts, kinda like life
[1:07:46] Raggu2: if youre capsaicin receptors arent faulty it releases endorphins
[1:07:49] Zeppolol: spicy is insane :D
[1:07:49] venvictas: Spicy and flavor are one
[1:07:50] chaarp: depends on the level of spicyness surely?
[1:07:50] TotallyNotRaien: some people like the thrill
[1:08:03] tsurghat: dont know if its scientifically proven but it gives a really good feeling
[1:08:08] Penwon29: because sometimes i need to feel something
[1:08:10] Zeppolol: and btw, why are you dead? :P
[1:08:10] SerThunderbeans: life is pain, food is life, only makes sense for it to hurt
[1:08:12] xFeldt: when i had covid for the first time i totally spiced everything like crazy... just because it was the only "feeling" still available... taste buds where like .... gone
[1:08:16] spanish_late: Naguura search ghormeh sabzi
[1:08:21] spanish_late: its super nice food
[1:08:23] Jacksprat47: plain food is bm hunter in freehold. spicy food is havoc dh in vortex pinnacle
[1:08:28] Raggu2: People eat kettle chips. Want to talk about things that make you feel pain while eating.
[1:08:30] Zirconn__: but also realize that most countries that make super spicy food live in hot climates and believe that sweating will cool you down
[1:08:31] Aegatron: emiruIME fak
[1:08:38] AceReformed: Thats a depleto
[1:08:41] AceReformed: It is what it is
[1:08:44] Oakley85: @Naguura It's an acquired taste. Its not painful or anything when you like it like that. You can build up to it and its just different
[1:09:00] MojoXan: wow, you look amazing
[1:09:04] Raggu2: Burned chips that are hard as rocks that splinter in your mouth and cut your gums.
[1:09:30] spanish_late: Naguura search ghormeh sabzi
[1:09:41] TotallyNotRaien: my problem with spicy food is that the spicy ingredient usually tastes like ass to me
[1:10:03] Elembry_us: Good song
[1:10:10] spanish_late: its super nice iranian food
[1:10:10] Raggu2: thats a bit of hyperbole based on my clearly biased opinion @Naguura but people claim they are good.
[1:10:24] tsurghat: Capsaicin tastes hot because it activates certain biological pathways in mammals – the same pathways activated by hot temperatures. The pain produced by spicy food can provoke the body to release endorphins and dopamine. This release can prompt a sense of relief or even a degree of euphoria
[1:10:32] muleyo: did the stars double tick insta on you btw?
[1:10:32] spanish_late: yeah a super delicous iranian food dish

[1:20:42] fede_ren: Finally someone uses science in cooking, then you can adjust whatever you have
[1:20:56] Burnprof: 201% ingrediants naguuraGiggle

[1:21:30] venvictas: The ratio part makes more sense.
[1:21:56] slagoroth: Probably needs a cup of hot dog flavored water
[1:23:30] RedLemonadeX: Yes you keep the ratio.
[1:23:34] Mecharobhzilla: it'd be comparative to the amount flouor
[1:24:33] RedLemonadeX: You add water and yeast to the amount of flour. And a tea spoon of salt.
[1:25:01] Nevamind0: for example?

[1:26:22] FifiBelle_: Yummy bacteria, amiright?
[1:26:37] RedLemonadeX: Yes you need to put right amount of yeast or your dough wont rise.
[1:26:46] nobodypicksbulbasaur: Sometimes a recipe, especially a small recipe, is just using the closest convenient sizes for their ingredients.  If it's off by a few grams or whatever it's fine because the recipe is small.
[1:27:02] nobodypicksbulbasaur: But then if you scale up the recipe and start multiplying, you also multiply those rounding errors and stuff gets weird
[1:27:11] Jacksprat47: baking powder/baking soda change based on scale

[1:28:33] RedLemonadeX: Ofc because its half of it Kappa
[1:30:03] Faithl3ssGaming: I could see you struggling to answer it with an example

[1:39:54] AceReformed: Not every body is stronger standing up btw
[1:40:19] AceReformed: Also if standing gives you more power, it will drain much more stamina

[2:21:18] Cyouskin: It might not be your vibe, but "Mythical Kitchen" is a fun youtube channel for cooking.  Good stories, good people, good food.

[2:38:01] shadowprogram: i got mine fitted
[2:38:09] Cyouskin: Height would likely be a big factor -- lighter is better for generics

[2:44:25] MaRiNexICEx: So good!!
[2:44:35] Metalburnie: Some series (or even settings) are just absurdly good for one season and wouldnt really need a new one. I mean I personally really enjoyed Reacher S1, and I thought the ending worked great without anything after. I dont even want to watch S2.

[2:51:27] rtcinema: No... I my the LFG tool
[2:51:29] kelhorn_: @Wrathbb1 he means in the group finder
[2:51:29] rtcinema: mean*
[2:52:27] rtcinema: It seems like an obvious requirement to know what classes are in a group before you apply in group finder. Once I started only applying to groups without my class I stopped getting declined very often at all

[3:00:05] Jacksprat47: I'm excited but I'm also not excited for the next few weeks of pug keys where teams try mdi pulls without mdi practice
[3:00:06] vikutoru11: incorporeal
[3:00:29] Stinth: I think higher key levels run the risk of less competitive games, due to the difficulty of running 4 dps. Any team that struggles with that can't compete
[3:00:59] DoggoGG: no its not
[3:01:10] rtcinema: Every AD I did after MDI wanted to snap the mobs down to rezan after priestest

[3:02:12] NkKouros: Sl s1
[3:02:16] MrBillJobss: after MDI
[3:02:20] rtcinema: What are the MDI dungeons being changed to? Are they upping them to 25s? Or only going up 1 key level?

[3:19:05] Jacksprat47: ngl I could see them moving solar beam to the class tree, making it a choice with skull bash and making it more accessible
[3:19:26] wardsdealnodmg: Also solar beam is more a commodity than really useful cus when do you have a situation where a silence saves the day but interrupts are useless
[3:19:28] KnotlessKnot: yeah, playing healers without an interrupt feels sooo bad
[3:19:44] asddyo: this is why shaman is de way
[3:19:53] wardsdealnodmg: Give moonkin belly bash interrupt naguuraREE
[3:19:54] KnotlessKnot: @asddyo KEKW
[3:19:58] darksource1987: Hi @naguura , is the a balance build that does both good on ST as AOE without changing talents?

[3:21:28] wardsdealnodmg: Thats why belly bash like gragas they do have the thiccness to interrupt with that. naguuraNudes
[3:21:41] alexz_gegee: yes but we are kinda used to it because we also go into bearform for every stupid mechanic that is going directly into us at least 1 global less would be nice

[4:14:21] Airwavve: Jack put it well "Healer damage is a luxury"
[4:14:32] NkKouros: If A dps got a 50+k dps boost people would be pogging out. None cares if a healer does 0 vs 50k (it's toxic to point it out lmao)
[4:15:08] ShieldSlamBR: It's also about how much damage the rest of the party avoid. If you have a party that doesn't avoid damage, you'll stress the healer and shouldn't expect healer damage.
[4:15:35] NkKouros: Healer damage is also a good way to skip a boss phase or stop casts going off.
[4:16:06] tsurghat: you can always expect healer dmg, a healer doing no dmg just wastes resources and time
[4:17:06] SimenT94: Main job: keep people alive. But all the damage you do is time saved. Also doing damage makes pulls die faster, so you dont't have to heal as much

[6:31:27] Fausstty: Tuna
[6:31:34] MixedBiscuit: I have never had tuna out of a can in my life lol.
[6:31:34] AceReformed: I've been sitting here drooling for the past 30 minutes
[6:31:35] Fausstty: and mayo
[6:31:38] AceReformed: but I've got more food at home
[6:31:40] AceReformed: Sadge
[6:31:50] SenorTostada: for real, bake the smashed potatoes in the oven to make em crispy, @oshiyi999
[6:31:57] oshiyi999: @SenorTostada yuh
[6:32:10] Fausstty: for some reason, when I bake potatoes in the oven, they never come out crispy
[6:32:12] SenorTostada: damn i love potatoes xD
[6:32:15] Fausstty: Is it the oven? is it the potatooes?
[6:32:25] oshiyi999: @Fausstty fuegoPout fuegoPout fuegoPout fuegoPout fuegoPout fuegoPout fuegoPout
[6:33:16] oshiyi999: @Fausstty maybe fry in oil for a bit first. or just higher heat w butter on top brah
[6:33:25] Fausstty: Generally speaking, any kind
[6:33:32] SenorTostada: @fausstty depends. have u tried coating in oil? how big are the chubks? also temperature is a big part and time (20 is the short end of things)
[6:33:42] Fausstty: Fries just come out hot but soft, not crispy at all
[6:33:42] oshiyi999: @Fausstty potato sama
[6:33:52] oshiyi999: vinegar can do a lot for crispyness
[6:34:22] Kuroz: the 8 pm end seems problematic, even 8:30 CatDriving
[6:34:25] MixedBiscuit: put dat oven on broil
[6:34:26] Fausstty: Yeah I usually drop paprika, vinegar and sometimes some pepper
[6:34:26] CamyK22: homefries are the American way of saying like small cut up potatoes, usually for breakfast, and have like oil and spices.   I recommend baking first, and then broiling
[6:34:34] SenorTostada: of fries come out soft its temperature probably. set it a bit higher. ~20 minutes on 220 C is good

[6:36:25] Fausstty: Listen, I don't live in Italian mountains, I'm sorry Kappa
[6:36:35] SenorTostada: what could help: if you have a dutch oven, put that in for 30 to 40 minutes and bake the fries in the dutch oven on highest temp. shuffle a bit halfway
[6:37:03] Fausstty: My kitchen is just the oven and a microwave

[6:41:16] bostonzig4865: sounds like a skill issue
[6:41:18] Viso3000: when you eat spaghetti you need to dirt yourself, it's tradition in italy....

[6:42:24] Fausstty: nah I'm like 40% italian
[6:42:28] Viso3000: Anyway spaghetti is really good with carbonara, like bucatini is really good as amatriciana, or tagliatelle with ragú bolognese
[6:42:39] Viso3000: i'm hungry now
[6:42:39] Guilleeee: same here from argentina, never heard about alfredo until i got in  touch with the english speaking community
[6:42:59] Andersonmps: I think brazil has the biggest italian comunity of the world
[6:43:01] SenorTostada: What is your fav pasta though, @naguura
[6:43:01] LtJenkins: I've visited italy a handful of times now and I don't think I've ever seen a cream white sauce even on the menu. And I assume if you request something ike that the restaurant asks for your travel visa
[6:43:01] Guilleeee: my guess is that alfredo is so common that it doesnt need an special name
[6:43:04] Viso3000: @Fausstty you lied ...
[6:43:13] kero50tree: HeyGuys
[6:43:17] Viso3000: who is alfredo?

[6:43:27] Fausstty: Alfredo is my friend
[6:43:59] dont_go_B: its called different in italy
[6:44:16] Guilleeee: google to the rescue: What we call alfredo sauce here in the US doesn't exist in Italy. Its closest cousin is similar to di Lelio's invention: a sauce known in Italy as “al burro” (with butter)
[6:44:17] Xklusev: Yo this channel is wild, Ive been working with this running in background and it just hit me, while listening. For about an hour we been talking about food lol
[6:44:26] Andersonmps: I dont think i ever had alfredo

[6:44:44] SenorTostada: I mean food can be so good.
[6:44:45] saltylittlemelody: I live in Italy I think italians can kill you  you for saying Alfredo is italian pasta recipe
