[1:48:14] Alaquane: they are 3 levels above you
[1:48:19] cyrex172: im seeing a wsg with 10 pallies vs 10 shamans
[1:48:45] SamuraiWillZ916: all these mobs are immune to flame shock Firelord; Lava Elemental; Lava Spawn; Blazing Fireguard; Firewalker; Ragnaros; Baron Geddon; Garr; Lava Annihilator; Molten Giant; Ancient Core Hound; Executus; Pyroguard Emberseer; Flamegor; Firemane Dragonspawn; Firemane Scalebane; Firemane Ash Tail; Infernal; Felguard Sentry; Immolatus; Lava Surger; Fireguard Destroyer; Evolving Ectoplasm

[1:50:31] Nenotv: flametonge for offweapon
[1:50:32] chollis13: FT if you end up duel weilding
[1:50:43] mayonaes: flametongue is better while leveling, specially if you have a fast weapon
[1:50:45] DemonicAngel318: Rockbiter is better than flametongue in every scenario unless you use OH for dps
[1:50:56] SamuraiWillZ916: you can DW in raids but not dgs
[1:51:28] SamuraiWillZ916: the molten are immunbe to your taunt
[1:51:29] chefdejour82: does molten blast spread flame shock?
[1:51:48] SamuraiWillZ916: dont waste the mana usig it on them and cast molten blast to them
[1:51:54] SamuraiWillZ916: @chefdejour82 nope
[1:52:14] SamuraiWillZ916: pull big with shaman so you can get mana back
[1:52:30] metavahn231: spec into that spirit baby
[1:52:30] chollis13: Yeah the Shield rune helps alot if big groups but i rarely use totems when questing cause the mana cost is so bad
[1:52:32] PokerFaceMoose: do they have qays to get mana back in combat?
[1:52:39] TheFDH: thats why you need the mana regen from sheild mastery
[1:52:41] chollis13: fire nova
[1:52:41] Lasidor: magma
[1:52:41] Alaquane: fire nova

[1:53:46] SamuraiWillZ916: bigger pulls @Towelliee
[1:53:52] SamuraiWillZ916: that will help with mana
[1:54:06] Alaquane: sam. calm down

[1:54:59] Alaquane: no

[2:06:43] one2gone: improves
[2:06:47] Holysal: @Holysal yes even orcs
[2:07:06] HaxzorJimDuggan: can probably buy a dagger much better for 20s on the ah
[2:08:11] Akurei87: A good route for weapons as tanking Shaman is dagger from here > dagger from Skum in WC > Meteor Shard from SFK and then dagger from PvP rep/Dagger from BFD
[2:08:13] Lintgamer: Nice hunter pull
[2:08:20] Aidler: party is on LUL
[2:08:25] chefdejour82: hunter pet lol

[2:09:27] Sollice: Herman Miller needs to stop sending me emails with their products. I am not going to spend $7400 on the Emes chairs..never....unless they send me two more emails
[2:09:29] Sollice: then I will
[2:09:30] chollis13: i use highest rank for dps and taunting but have rank one keybound just for interupts
[2:09:46] Troggie: youll want to use ES 1 just for taunt so 1 is better
