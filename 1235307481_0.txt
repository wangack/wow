[5:05:26] ironforge_1337: rip
[5:05:29] rbubbaray: yeah NW is dieing
[5:05:36] Rel2021: It's about 90k users at the high now
[5:05:38] qengx: its just lacking replayability and meaningful endgame content, beautiful game, great foundations tho
[5:05:41] Rel2021: Started with a mil
[5:05:53] Sakrasta: I think New World had too few abilities. Just 3 abilities per weapon feels like almost nothing, could have been 5 or something.
[5:06:24] Velashen: They need more abilities for sure.
[5:06:25] ZPUTTAN: new world is imo too "bland"
[5:06:43] ghostninjadog: NW just needs to go through its growing pains. In 3 yrs. it will be great
[5:06:47] Velashen: The harvesting/crafting felt really good though
[5:06:56] xplicit_tm: i enjoyed it alot and almost got to 60 but soo many bugs and issues with people duping items/gold and nerfs almost every other day
[5:06:56] Meatchopper: Gotta love The Unstoppable Force  - brings back such great memories :D
[5:07:07] 수줍은: why did you stop playing tbc ?
[5:07:20] rbubbaray: its way down in twitch now , with Xaryu having 1.5k views and being tops views, there was guys with 20k views , and they dont stream it nomore
[5:07:21] qengx: but think, how many times in  wow you have started a new character and replayed the whole game over and over, theres not really much point of an alt in new world, i think thats important for an mmo
[5:07:27] sheerheartattackyk: took one month, almost two for people to leave my server that was always full. Also all the territories we had we lost them all so no point in playing anymore
[5:08:07] rbubbaray: wow is buring another wow killer .. once again
[5:08:28] Sakrasta: I personally like that you don't have to level an alt in New World if you wanna play a different "class"
[5:08:36] kupexd: @Swifty  is that your gf?
[5:08:39] Chrimz_: 19 HOURS?!?!?!
[5:08:41] sheerheartattackyk: just like ff14, just learn the job you want and level it, why have 20000 alts, no point in that
[5:08:50] rondalesc: Yo da man Swift!  Wish I could see you do this grind on your old NE
[5:09:04] rbubbaray: one thing I hated about NW, the fixed cursor
[5:09:11] qengx: well if ur gonna have a system like that you need enough content to support it, ff14 has that

[5:39:01] Sakrasta: You have no bracket 14 on your server anymore. That might force you to server transfer.
[5:39:03] maximumracing: OOOH im done for WG
[5:39:03] IdolizeAU: Hey Swifty. When you look at honorspy there is no bracket 14 for your server. How are you going to get rank 14?

[5:40:35] Sakrasta: I think last week people farmed a bunch of honor in AV, thought they would rank up, but got almost no rank and ragequit LUL
[5:40:37] Rel2021: The server transfer option is there though does it not work
[5:40:38] Devismo: It's not impossible, just requires coordination
[5:41:04] OneGauge44: Im bracket 6 - 42 haha so strange

[5:56:07] boltyboytv: its wsg weekend rn
[5:56:10] HobbitCreed: swiftyPlove
[5:56:10] Gizimoo86: you can but its slower?
[5:56:11] IdolizeAU: you need bracket 14
[5:56:32] Revolverrr_: u need br 13+
[5:56:46] IdolizeAU: That was a theory people had before SoM launched which was proved wrong right away
[5:56:46] phearz_tv: under the old system you needed to hit a b14 i think at some point
[5:56:54] milkdrinkr: no, you dont, decay is lower, you can get it as low as br3 i believe, obviously br1 would be faster though
[5:57:00] phearz_tv: like ur last week at least but maybe im completely wrong
[5:57:04] Andy9b: u gotta go ham at some point swifty
[5:57:12] Thomas_Vilholm: @Swifty you gonna sit in av untill naxx?
[5:57:15] xplicit_tm: yea i heard you can just takes longer to get it
[5:57:33] IdolizeAU: @milkdrinkr - decay is not lower. Decay is also doubled.
[5:57:43] Andy9b: u cant do R14 without BR1 / BR2
[5:58:20] Cebelx: @milkdrinkr decay is not lower. Decay is 40% instead of 20%. RP is doubled as well.
[5:58:30] Garanoose: He said you can’t
[5:58:40] Revolverrr_: if htey left decay at 20% u could do it with lowr brackets
[5:58:45] IdolizeAU: Yes it's proven
[5:58:48] Cebelx: 100% you need at least 1 week in BR14 to get R14
[5:58:48] Andy9b: u can do the math
[5:58:52] Ralzagar: I'm pretty sure you can't do it, unless they changed the decay, which I doubt
[5:58:58] haileyxzx: I mean you can organize an event where your viewers make a lvl 1 and group up at a graveyard and kill a lvl 1 opposite faction to increase pool size right?
[5:58:59] milkdrinkr: @IdolizeAU semantics, meant RP, forgot the specifics of reddit fresh
[5:59:00] Cebelx: 6 weeks @ BR14 = rank 14 from rank 1
[5:59:25] Revolverrr_: ye poolboosting still happens but u cant do it with deleted characters anymore
[5:59:45] En_Jen: is the gaming house live again?
[5:59:58] Andy9b: 55000 * 0.60 = 33000. Br 3 would then give u the same RP
[6:00:02] Andy9b: 0 progress
[6:00:14] Andy9b: if u were r13

[8:39:52] ThiCCboiyG: @swifty, i love doing damage but i also love the idea of sword and board (sword and shield) over a 2 handed weapon obviously you wont max your damage and things but for a casual player is it reasonable to level as a prot warrior or the paladin equivalent , i just like having a shield

[10:49:55] Slaizwei: @reese99 no you will need bracket 14 for r14
[10:49:57] bigppgamer69: its not possible anymore cause they did 40% decay instead of what they said they were gonna do
[10:50:03] Slaizwei: and the honor decay is doubled
[10:50:09] Euhordetime: Give flag to mage

[12:17:40] xmedpakx: @GlitchRekal yes making old content does split the community, overall long term bottom line its bad for WoW. they should focus on the future for wow which is Retail. i can only hope ppl who play classic might head back to retail later to help the game move forward
