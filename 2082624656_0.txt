[4:33:23] Moobot: Join my Discord community! https://discord.gg/mes
[4:34:11] wEiRdO_dUdE: Legion was so great because they started working on it very hard during Draenor which caused a content drought
[4:34:55] bestoutgod: sometimes i dont understand blizzard
[4:35:09] wEiRdO_dUdE: We got Tanaan jungle but it was rough to keep playing all the time during Draenor, because they moved resources to working on Legion
[4:36:13] wEiRdO_dUdE: Legion wasn't a normal expansion for Blizzard, it was 1 and 1/4 or 1 and 1/2 of the usual cycle
[4:37:41] wEiRdO_dUdE: But yeah I'm not a big fan of those react creators, they spend a lot of time just talking trash. Good for their video views, but not for me LUL

[5:01:27] zeref_qq: FACTS

[5:02:08] TheEyeVII: I wouldn't recommend taking any of asmon's opinions seriously, take that shit with a giant grain of salt
[5:02:10] iLLwiLL_HS: @TheEyeVII it was an endless AP grind which made it terrible
[5:02:15] Vtal: I think retail is impenetrable for new players
[5:03:27] TheEyeVII: I liked AP grindin', it gave you something to do on your main after the typical "content" or at least progression after just gearing @iLLwiLL_HS
[5:05:01] iLLwiLL_HS: @TheEyeVII without constant upkeep, even on a main, you fall behind. i quit for about half the expansion and just never caught up enough to be competitive for the rest of the expansion
[5:05:46] Vtal: Refreshing perspective on comparing the content value imo
[5:05:57] TheEyeVII: ya it was 8 years ago, how geared or progressed you are at any mmo depends on how much time you got to spend on it @iLLwiLL_HS
