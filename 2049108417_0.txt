[2:51:08] Ayden051: @erttis_pc ye i mean we could kill it but some ppl dont even try play their class properly sadly, if everyone tried im sure we would get it at like 15% buff max
[2:51:13] kenpachie11: he's playing together with sossesvina
[2:51:29] kenpachie11: hell yeah
[2:51:30] Ayden051: was reply to you @kenpachie11
[2:51:44] kenpachie11: transfering to play pvp on firemaw is against TOS?
[2:52:09] kenpachie11: for guilds that raid only 1 day
[2:52:11] erttis_pc: we also had some issues with boomer guild but got it finally with 20% buff ddx
[2:52:13] kenpachie11: LK HC is quite challenging
[2:52:16] kenpachie11: since they lack the experience
[2:52:22] kenpachie11: not enough pulls etc
[2:53:27] kenpachie11: yep , that's why ur LOD was like 3 weeks behind other pugs
[2:53:54] dan77799: i agree
[2:54:08] dan77799: What he said there, ppl ned to wipe so you learn fights
[2:54:17] Drunkuser_bg: xdxd
[2:54:23] dan77799: its how life works
[2:54:31] dan77799: need too fail to learn :D
[2:54:53] dan77799: accept demons they never learn xD
[2:55:03] kenpachie11: if u had wipes, you would kill it the night u had BB/nota/prog players
[2:55:11] kenpachie11: but ur own lack of exp was cause of no kill then
[2:55:21] Drunkuser_bg: xdxd 󠀀
[2:55:26] Drunkuser_bg: reqless not even coming for 30% buff
[2:55:28] Drunkuser_bg: so bad KEKL

[2:55:36] Drunkuser_bg: scamar
[2:55:38] dan77799: yy
[2:56:07] kenpachie11: to be fair in full geared raids, on 30% u probably play solo tnak like in 10man

[2:56:52] kenpachie11: For sure
[2:56:58] kenpachie11: u probably skip 2nd shambler as well
[2:57:28] kenpachie11: But that will be rare, since on 30% everyone will get greedy and bring like x2 naked cars every raid :D
[2:57:36] mhaqtv: a lot of tanks underestimate the application of SR, they mainly want cds for the explosion but the one-shot comes in p3 with melee+SR application
[2:57:59] mhaqtv: especially after sword phase

[6:59:43] Hoggiss: Gomes, the supposed mastermind, orchestrates a laughable spectacle of incompetence. His clueless performance in the raid unfolds like a pixelated circus, leaving the party caught between boss challenges and his absurd antics. May the digital gods grant the group the patience to endure Gomes' unparalleled foolishness without losing their sanity.

[7:03:28] lassekoongoo: Morgan: Gomes, the supposed mastermind, orchestrates a laughable spectacle of incompetence. His clueless performance in the raid unfolds like a pixelated circus, leaving the party caught between boss challenges and his absurd antics. May the digital gods grant the group the patience to endure Gomes' unparalleled foolishness without losing their sanity.

[9:05:36] JustParms: nothing
[9:05:40] gomestheking: grief big
[9:05:44] klxlxlx: Morgan: Here we see a wild Gomes in its natural habitat, Gomes was sent here to wipe in GDKPs thanks to his weaponized incompetence, zero self awareness and cognitive abilities. Cold logic deemed this raid to be doomed in the hands of Gomes the WIPER OF GDKPS.
[9:05:44] gomestheking: makes demonic
[9:05:50] gomestheking: strats
[9:05:52] gomestheking: and gets carried around
[9:05:56] gomestheking: and no punishment
[9:06:04] daveinspace_: @Riceyx infuser being spam dispeled
[9:06:09] gomestheking: @daveinspace_
[9:06:11] gomestheking: spam?
[9:06:13] gomestheking: I dispelled once
[9:06:21] Defeat_G: Gomes, the supposed mastermind, orchestrates a laughable spectacle of incompetence. His clueless performance in the raid unfolds like a pixelated circus, leaving the party caught between boss challenges and his absurd antics. May the digital gods grant the group the patience to endure Gomes' unparalleled foolishness without losing their sanity.
