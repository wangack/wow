[3:13:47] charbx0r: @omerede01 BfA wasn't terrible. Aesthetically beautiful and a ton of allied races. And story wasn't the worse. It's the one that came after, Shadowlands, that virtually no one likes

[3:15:47] altie1: Lost interest in gw very fast
[3:15:49] trip_ma: wildstar introduced base building to mmos
[3:15:49] DacePerado: Modern MMO and Classic MMO game design is completely different
[3:15:53] MustBeBetween4n25Letters: I thought Wildstar was almost outrageous. I liked the fighting in Tera, too.
[3:16:00] Mothman_666: I loved FF11 but it was insanely difficult, its funny at the time, WoW was considered a more "casual" MMO
[3:16:03] altie1: Omfg city of heroes, is that the cartoony one where you can customize your hero???
[3:16:03] Natlum: Elder Scrolls isn't bad
