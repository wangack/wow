[0:01:42] camshreds: morning y'all
[0:02:55] ren0m: Morning
[0:03:43] kondelol: How do you decide if you play incarn or convoke?
[0:06:04] Wiseved: HeyGuys jb
[0:06:14] Wiseved: Doesnt look like a good start of the stream
[0:06:55] ren0m: Any plans on checking out tournament realms?
[0:06:58] omnixslash: good morning jb. great takes in the max video
[0:07:29] FuruF: hasHi
[0:07:32] itsRikyspanish: holy ads
[0:15:23] MrDadDude: morning daddy
[0:17:01] ren0m: A sigh of relief
[0:17:09] face2face: What max video
[0:17:20] face2face: Gm team
[0:17:30] MrDadDude: nah nah you need to be there
[0:17:39] ren0m: You can find that kind of comments everywhere
[0:17:48] aimbim: would be a great loss if you werent in that video
[0:17:48] hankypankieee: nah man you were great dont let them get you down
[0:17:50] ren0m: As if you'll get anything from reading comments on YT
[0:18:14] waelrick: LUL
[0:18:24] face2face: Oh the dungeons ranking. Did you disagree with the rest of them a lot? I'm not watching 2h with some of those people
[0:18:31] ren0m: It's just "cool" to hate on someone
[0:18:32] face2face: Gimme a tldr why ppl hating?
[0:18:33] laalaaland22: sounds like their problem to me
[0:18:38] Calair_: jokes one them, still commented, still got the YT algo points
[0:18:45] Calair_: *on them
[0:18:56] aimbim: negative comments usually get the most engagement on youtube dont stress about it
[0:19:02] chaarp: was interesting to see the ranking. it was very different from how i would rank them
[0:19:18] 초콜릿니키: thats what you get for running tranq LUL
[0:19:18] ren0m: Those are probably non-shirt-wearing nubs
[0:19:39] laedine: You're great mate - don't let the trolls put you down
[0:19:55] MrDadDude: that top comment has been edited. Dude put "i repent for my cringe reactionary comment no asked for"  after people roasted the fuck out him on his comment
[0:20:28] face2face: @chaarp Yeah definitely, I got the final ranking screenshot and I disagree with a lot. 30s is such a dif perspective than my keys
[0:21:10] ren0m: I just like how the chat is most active while JB is in an intense fight. Running in Valdrakken? Chat is quiet :P
[0:21:28] aimbim: at the end of the day its just people talking about what they liked and didnt like. Idk why people would get mad about that
[0:22:11] MrDadDude: i watched the whole 2 hours, thought it was good content
[0:22:45] MrDadDude: my fav part is when they talk about infinite scaling. cause that shit gotta get fixed
[0:22:46] krug95: rough to play rdruid, it looks so easy when jd plays it
[0:23:08] kelly_mac06: i watched it while they were on max's stream. def did not agree with all the takes
[0:23:16] StreamElements: fresh youtube shorts going up 3x a week on https://www.youtube.com/@jdotb
[0:23:31] hankypankieee: in case anyone was wondering punxsutawney phil did not see his shadow this morning so early spring it is
[0:23:35] ren0m: @StreamElements stop lying
[0:23:47] MrDadDude: people just going on and on about not being able to do keys at like a 31. and im over here like... at what level are they going to be happy, cause most people don't do 22's let along 31 and we got creators saying class balance is bad... its so weird to have creators be so disconnected from the player base
[0:24:56] ren0m: How about they add challenge mode for those who reach X M+ lvl.
[0:25:02] dithrica: reading the comments on the dungeon tier list vid, can vone of the youths enlighten me, is saying something is "cooked" a good thing or a bad thing lol
[0:25:15] Crystallize007: bad
[0:25:23] kondelol: @MrDadDude didnt they say that class balance is good in the max video
[0:25:46] StreamElements: restreaming live every day to https://www.youtube.com/@jdotb
[0:25:47] dithrica: @crystallize007 thx mate
[0:26:20] MrDadDude: @kondelol Yea they did, but everyday you can see a video of other content creators saying balance is bad cause " we can't live this 1 shot on a 30"
[0:26:38] MrDadDude: balance is amazing... up to like key level 26-28
[0:26:58] kelly_mac06: @MrDadDude yes and that's targeted at the crowd that is DOING 30's not at the crowd doing weekly 20's lol
[0:26:59] MrDadDude: then like JB pointed out, its a problem that damage of mobs and health scale equally
[0:27:31] hankypankieee: @MrDadDude they want to play the game infinitely but when infinite scaling kicks in they feel cheated, I think they should cap M+ at 30 and when you do all 30's you a a "you beat M+" title
[0:27:31] Ok_Kingston: I think the timers being too long are the only reason people have proiblems with scaling
[0:27:33] MrDadDude: well the game is not balanced at 30's
[0:27:42] omnixslash: well jb is the only consistent pug player so only his opinion matters really
[0:28:08] MrDadDude: @hankypankieee something needs to be done. JB had a good take that i think would be nice to see
[0:28:10] Naowh: fuck 4 dps
[0:28:17] KDaily: isnt it sort of hard to expect it would be balanced for the absolute highest level?
[0:28:19] Razzeu: robin Stare
[0:28:24] theBroHam: Robin sighting!
[0:28:24] Crystallize007: @Naowh :)
[0:29:22] Ok_Kingston: if the timers were properly tuned, people would be doing 28s-29s at the highest and not getting 1 shot
[0:29:48] Ok_Kingston: @Naowh pepega
[0:29:58] MrDadDude: JB tell em your idea to fix scaling
[0:30:08] MrDadDude: it was great take and hope a blizz dev hears it
[0:30:11] hankypankieee: @MrDadDude I thin the frustration actually comes from there being a limit but it not being obvious where that limit is, if everyone knew "30 is the best you can do" then when someone got all 30s they feel  a sense of acomplishment, rather than "if I could only live that one part I could do a 31!"
[0:30:24] ren0m: I'm sure Blizz is waiting for JB to share his idea LUL
[0:30:32] mogaman_: mogaman_ watched 5 consecutive streams this month and sparked a watch streak! 
[0:30:36] MrDadDude: JB, is this nations backbone
[0:31:21] MrDadDude: @hankypankieee i agree with that. do you think if it was more about beating the timer and not "living one shots" people who bitch less?
[0:31:25] MrDadDude: would*
[0:31:44] Razzeu: monkaS leaked
[0:32:05] ren0m: oui oui
[0:32:48] hankypankieee: @MrDadDude probably, but I really think main issue is just not knowing where the end is, people dont lose their shit when tindral takes 400 pulls cause you know it can be done and there is an end
[0:33:54] kelly_mac06: you're an easy target
[0:34:00] kelly_mac06: nah we love JB
[0:34:07] kelly_mac06: lots of engagement farming lol
[0:34:09] Lrauq: youtube commenters aren't real people so it's all good
[0:34:16] kelly_mac06: nooo you did not
[0:34:18] kelly_mac06: don't skip
[0:34:19] kelly_mac06: pls
[0:34:20] Lara_TV_: I've only listened to the first half, but those people are just drones
[0:34:24] MrDadDude: dude it would be boring with out you. it's 4 dudes agreeing with each other
[0:34:25] hankypankieee: I think you're great man! no one wants to hear everyone patting eachother on the back and agreeing with themselves
[0:34:29] Solaster: thought it was a good discussion. everyone had their take but was general agreement from everyone
[0:34:31] Sizebot: They're just mad because you have the balls to speak the truth that they don't want to hear
[0:34:33] Lara_TV_: I disagree with almost all your raid takes, but you're cool :)
[0:34:34] racoon_danger: They hated him because he said the truth
[0:34:37] ren0m: I legit don't see any negative comments except for the one describing you as "old dude that sits on his porch yelling about everything possible"
[0:34:41] MrDadDude: @Sizebot preach!
[0:34:44] ren0m: Which is funny more than insulting imo

[0:59:08] dithrica: do they let you play no healer in the actual mdi?
[1:00:01] sake_xo: @dithrica yes, i've seen it.. they've also done double tank no healer
[1:00:37] sake_xo: seemed possible, but didn't win
[1:00:50] dithrica: @sake_xo yeah makes sense otherwise I imagine you couldn't do it in time trials either, idk why I thought they had comp requirements like that. just no multiple of the same specs yeah?

[2:07:22] somethineuw: orr im off
[2:07:29] RayeAerinae: is this really a push week?
[2:08:32] somethineuw: if the affixes are not completely annoying ppl call it push week
[2:08:44] ninah_wtf: yeah, its more like 3350 LUL I did the feely math on it, not a real one
[2:14:39] TBouse: it doesnt get much better than these affixes on tyran
[2:15:27] Jemba: Deadge

[2:23:52] Cruzerthebruzer: desperation mode for sure
[2:24:06] ren0m: Time to do the most dmg
[2:24:10] reggiepowa: this is rip, 4 min for xavius tyra seems unlikely
[2:25:05] ridder30: dont worry they have lust
[2:25:31] Perry_TP: they just need 900k dps ^^
[2:25:34] ren0m: jdotbHypers
[2:26:32] face2face: This boss just fucks me up
[2:29:09] reggiepowa: that hitbox
[2:29:13] majestictaco0: yeah the hitbox being bigger is wild

[2:30:07] ridder30: jb, just wanted to say that your take about boomkins whining about having to go into bear form is based and i appreciate you
[2:30:40] theBroHam: @Cruzerthebruzer he was definitely not in that
[2:30:41] lllGroovylll: What iem do you use
[2:30:46] Cruzerthebruzer: @Cruzerthebruzer for sure not
[2:30:55] theBroHam: !earbuds
[2:30:55] StreamElements: Shuoer S12s
[2:31:12] nemzky: I mean thematically its pretty cool, druids actually using their other forms for different situations
[2:31:18] weezie_61: Blizz could just get rid of bear form and let you just die. I mean I would be happy with a VDH form ay havoc... just sayin
[2:31:22] nemzky: but its definitely lame to not be able to dps lol
[2:32:27] Sykeasaurus: are you running invigorate for dht only?
[2:32:36] ridder30: yea but lots of other classes have to stop dps to live as well.  and bear form is insanely tanky
[2:33:09] weezie_61: just imagine a havoc with VDH meta form! I would 100% take the dmg loss to live
[2:33:24] umschnallskrrt: !talents
[2:33:28] umschnallskrrt: FeelsBadMan
[2:34:09] weezie_61: Other class' just are not brought becasue they die. atleast druid gets invited to keys becasue they can live in bear form
[2:34:33] RayeAerinae: jb have you accidentally invited any shadowpriests lately
[2:35:29] face2face: @weezie_61 Havoc such a squishy spec frr
[2:35:39] face2face: Just imagine if they were tanky haHAA
[2:35:56] face2face: All these compromises DHs have to make for survivability too
[2:39:27] weezie_61: @face2face you think Havoc more tanky than Druid KEKW!!! they have to rock Tank Trinkey and get externals from Aug/Pala to not get one shot. They are good against Rot dmg not 1 shots
[2:40:38] weezie_61: did you not just see this Havoc get destroyed by last boss in the 29.
[2:40:48] phataus22: @jdotb for higher keys would you recommend enchanting leech or avoidance as rdruid?
[2:40:51] weezie_61: with a SAC
[2:41:36] TBouse: havoc starts getting a bit squishy on high tyran compared to other meta specs

[3:27:56] skeeld: can it still pick the tank and a dps

[3:30:51] Najjic: if ppl aren’t positioning correctly you just gotta be ready to insta fast one the first 2 targeted before they get a secondary hit
