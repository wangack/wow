[6:09:55] warcraftbuddies: Season of Mastery is what the people requested. And it is also a ways for blizzard to make a couple bucks. When they started classic, they already had everything programmed, tweaking it, and making it harder, or making a second version requires little work, and brings major profit.
[6:09:58] warcraftbuddies: That's what it is :D
[6:10:14] Chosey: i mean seasons like diablo 3 does. they reset every year or so
