[0:58:51] Shiwoon_TV: we Gucci
[0:59:04] Plushie__Tv: might be me then, its better now. Just went quiet and loud and was up down. yes
[0:59:32] begman: do you the think the 20% nerf to pom and penance was nessesary or was it to hard ;p
[0:59:55] Shiwoon_TV: yeah if he is not facing the microphone he is very low. but else it‚Äôs good now I would say
[0:59:56] Plushie__Tv: just need staff & neck for my priest, we are having terrible drops lately
[1:00:07] cockjab: pom and penance will always be good just because of how they work
[1:00:12] bubz_zerg_bugs: with 90% full bis though
[1:01:38] Plushie__Tv: im so excited for phase 2, I really hope we start to see some trickles of info like a "hype" video showing some rune sneakpeaks and such
[1:01:42] cockjab: the extra dps while solo healing is kinda meta for how fast the bosses die imo
[1:02:45] greatsadge: well u know wars are getting intervene it says on the warbringer tooltip
[1:02:46] Plushie__Tv: the element of surprise is great, I just cant help but spoil myself :D
[1:03:02] yaaksha: Ryan you sound like you've got a turtlehead going
[1:03:22] mokabear: Are you planning to solo heal Kelris?
[1:03:26] yaaksha: 9 new runes per class, spoil 3 (one per slot), keep 2 runes per slot hidden
[1:03:29] yaaksha: Would be best compromise
[1:03:41] iamboee: I actually want to know what will be of the epic crafted items

[1:06:26] mokabear: It'd be cool if they made more BoP stuff for like alchemy and self-enchants
[1:06:42] cockjab: i like the idea of 1 really good item from each main profession like they did this phase
[1:07:15] mokabear: 1 main item won't be good enough as we go through phases, engi is clearly ahead
[1:07:27] Plushie__Tv: yeah I really like the crafted epics, I just associate gnomeregan and engineering together and think we will see something for engi in there. Upgrading our current crafted epics would be cool
[1:07:43] mokabear: Next phase, yeah, Engi will be way ahead
[1:08:04] varaipad: why blizzard dont add all proffs for pvp buffs, its lol sod its really pvp exp , pve players dont need play sod

[1:09:55] mokabear: Nah, Wolfshead is the power shifting helm
[1:10:30] kaanlu: @mokabear Crazy to me that they likely arent gonna have wolfshead helm next phase

[1:20:06] mokabear: They'll get chain heal, so yes
[1:20:06] bassiemon123: Btw did u see some of the ancestral guidance one shot video's. Pritty nuts that u can use potions/healthstones with it.
[1:20:43] jcurt03: What about Cata WITH changes
[1:20:51] bassiemon123: Riptide would be huge

[1:21:38] noteimoo: do you think we get rated bgs or arenas at 60?
[1:22:14] Glenlol: @noteimoo they've already made an official statement saying they wont do that because they dont want to be sidetracked trying to balance constructed pvp and would rather focus on other fun content & runes
