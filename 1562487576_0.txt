[1:07:00] Funderik: i don't think it would be twitch drops for beta, cus you need sub would cause so much child rage.
[1:07:01] dracullus: free beta key if you get tattoo "blizzard did nothing wrong"
[1:07:11] PraetorFTW: i wish i could help u towlee but im in eu

[1:08:30] Unitsven: junkyard 15-17min run
[1:08:45] Flippyyz: nah man ive personally seen keys with BDKs just soloing pulls and others with them doing 20k overall
[1:08:46] neverbornlucky: Towellie I thought your third ability was a bunch of crazy twitch followers trying to follow you around in game
[1:09:06] tronbadgames: normal mode sylv. cant do it on LFR
[1:09:10] MistyValkyrie: LFR doesnt count towards the mount
[1:09:29] Quizzylife: Does anyone know when they send out alpha invites? Daily, weekly or so? :) I want it so badly! :D

[1:10:02] TheGiant99: @Towelliee good morning bro
[1:10:38] illusion1990: I got a 15 junkyard if you want it
[1:10:46] lithium364: i wish the mount had better textures, i was hoping for an actual full slime mount not just the cat skeleton with green lucent skin
[1:11:50] illusion1990: yea trying to message you
[1:12:34] illusion1990: Ive never messaged cross realm before
[1:12:53] LunaKura: Honest question. Do you think Shadowlands will go down as the worst xpac ever?
[1:13:10] illusion1990: thx just messaged
[1:13:36] Gapplebees1: ay lets goooo
[1:13:42] JellonaCub: bfa also worse
[1:13:52] tronbadgames: WoD, Cata, SL/BFA tied
[1:13:54] Bobthebaker1: Honestly this new season.. im having a blast there been expansions where i havent liked any of the pathces
[1:13:57] tronbadgames: spectral
[1:14:03] binkz77: flask of power
[1:14:03] Highparkk_: bfa was way better than SL in my opinion
[1:14:03] Alepouditsa: @JellonaCub PunOko
[1:14:08] Gapplebees1: BFA was solid
[1:14:08] munchie66: BFA was so garbanzo
[1:14:17] lithium364: i played more in WoD then Shadowlands
[1:14:19] Gapplebees1: after the first patch it got so much better
[1:14:22] akia03: bfa was good
[1:14:29] KaisenSiru: BFA was amazing
[1:14:51] tronbadgames: eh, BFAs lore was mid at best

[1:16:05] Wolfenhoof: @o_illusionz Even in WoD i played at least 6 months, SL was over after 4 weeks, i just recently leveled my chars to 60 and thats it. Torghast&Maw was absolute filth. You can only like SL if you play Dungeons/Raids and give a crap about the open world content. Lorewise it was an embarassment as well.

[1:16:24] Bobthebaker1: that is also the thing in this discussion its always subjective.. cause some people decides WQ farming is the most important some raiding some lore etc
[1:16:25] neverbornlucky: I thought published books determined if a expansion was a success
[1:16:25] deep_learning_ai: gameplay wise Legion has to be up there

[1:16:45] LunaKura: @Towelliee In a way, Cata is a favorite of mine. However that is because that's when I started. I consider myself a Dragon Soul "baby" xD
[1:17:17] Highparkk_: blizz can keep shrine of the storm though
[1:17:29] overlyintelligent: @DeanoTV late night ashran all the way KEKW

[1:18:08] LunaKura: I say this, but I'd be 100% more happy to see them skip Cata for a "classic" over to MoP <3
[1:18:23] neverbornlucky: Linch King was favorite expansion
[1:18:27] DeanoTV: Wod had actual 0 content for casuals was trash
[1:18:45] tronbadgames: you can redo

[1:26:55] lithium364: sanctum lfr was brutal for me yesterday over 1 hour wiping on sylvanas
[1:26:57] KaisenSiru: Unlimited POWAAAA
[1:27:00] theoriginalzinng: zappy boys everywhere
[1:27:19] theoriginalzinng: tell him to 'settle down palpatine'
[1:27:42] Ritizmo: is gear gonna become useless in Dragonflight?
[1:28:26] NickFPV: @Ritizmo Probably wont be replacing 291s till mythic dungeons at max level
[1:28:30] Ritizmo: awww, that's fair but I liked my double heroic leap on my fury warrior
[1:28:38] Bobthebaker1: @Ritizmo Current gear will be used for leveling most likely depeding on ur ilvl then ull change the gear at max level
[1:29:08] quentinkil: hi how are you Towelliee
[1:29:12] theoriginalzinng: yeah my bfa gear lasted me to almost max level on SL launch
[1:29:19] Gargantix: just got here, how come you're in a mechagon run with a full party? o-o' @Towelliee
[1:29:29] nocturnal_2195: good morning
[1:29:30] theoriginalzinng: just how it is, but it quickly gets replaced with heroic dungeon loot at max level lol
[1:29:32] Ritizmo: @bobthebaker1 Yee, hopefully we get some real cool stuff
[1:29:39] NickFPV: At least this time It wont feel tooo bad leveling. Losing stuff like corruption or artifact weapons was brutal while leveling
[1:30:06] Gargantix: but isn't this a BFA dungeon? confused
[1:30:17] BoiAtomico: welcome to season 4
[1:30:32] Gargantix: I haven't played season 4 yet haha
[1:30:33] KaisenSiru: PepeLaugh
[1:30:38] Wcvechten: season 4 has older dungeons in the pool for M+_
[1:30:43] Hyoss: @Gargantix Season 4 adds old dungeons scaled to lvl 60 to break up the monotony of SL dungeons only.
[1:30:43] Bobthebaker1: @Gargantix There is m+ now in 6 old dungs like mechagon and karazhan
[1:30:44] Gargantix: ooooohh
[1:30:48] jerexify: @Gargantix S4 SL is both Tazavesh, both Mechagon, both Karazhan, GD, and ID.
[1:30:52] Gargantix: I see
[1:30:54] nocturnal_2195: man I'm not looking forward to this 8 hour maintenance  tomorrow  that will most likely  get extended
[1:31:32] theoriginalzinng: man im gonna alpha all friggin day tomorrow. i still cant believe i actually got it
[1:31:32] Bobthebaker1: ur missing grease
[1:31:32] nvnto: oil

[1:32:37] Gargantix: gonna check out any other games during maintenance?
[1:32:48] theoriginalzinng: so @Towelliee do alpha people usually also get beta when it comes out or do i have to wait another 15 years for luck again?
[1:32:48] Dianne____: that damage
[1:33:07] ZeroNpcTV: that bear skin looks nice, unfortunately i miss my chances
[1:33:13] nocturnal_2195: maybe during that 8 hours I will find something to do.... but I doubt it
[1:33:16] quentinkil: i think your bear shape is nice

[3:05:50] abracka_: yeah that pack you just pulled has three mobs that do a shrapnel blast at the same time, just does insane damage
[3:05:53] doomkry: the problem with the later part of grimrail depot is that you cant interrupt much of the abilites that the trash mobs cast
[3:06:02] TastyPoop49: @Towelliee do you share your elvui (or just your ui)?
[3:06:03] Orion280: it's not storming next week is it?

[4:22:46] Strouss: i acxtually like the Hunt one of my fav abilities, but the kryian was better.
[4:22:46] LunaKura: @Towelliee I like to predict that Beta will be release roughly close to Wrath Classic release.
[4:22:49] agnarz: they're probably adding random stuff just to give us some false hope D:

[4:24:06] Mitchendo64: shortest alpha phase ever
[4:24:29] Mitchendo64: true

[4:27:33] elderikp: They tried with allowing too many people in the beta that didn't work
[4:27:39] EpicJune: yeah one streamer would have about 5k people trying to get one
[4:27:41] Wolfegang16: I think the reason you put people through those hoops though is to show their interest at a higher level knowing they will actually play more and test more
[4:27:53] thunderx79: server power !!! we are not living in 2012 ?

[5:38:51] TompsonX: @xzeewolf Unless you really want to play WoTK again, Shadowlands
[5:38:59] TompsonX: It's as simple as that, they're different games
[5:39:18] xzeewolf: i want to play dragonflight on launch, should i start leveling a character in shadowlands now to prepare?

[5:40:30] HoboFighter2: How long does it take to finish the Shadowlands main questline right now?
[5:40:35] xzeewolf: is shadowlands worth buying or just wait for dragonflight?
[5:40:46] theszoti: @theszoti i mean if tomorrow is the final phase of alpha...
[5:40:46] looney199725: @Wcvechten thats pretty damn gd

[5:41:20] ChrisStoll: definitely servers coming back up
[5:41:26] AlphasaurusRexx: @HoboFighter2 a few hours probably. nothing is time gated right now so you can cram if you want to.
[5:41:30] Wcvechten: @Wcvechten Is it? idk never used the trinket but  idk how bad the downsides are for it
[5:41:53] TakMaggy: the zones look so good
[5:41:59] SaucyBelly: is there an opt in for the beta yet? or is that something that will come in the coming weeks?

[5:42:15] BriscoGDP: lookin very WoD Nagrand like
[5:42:38] mayonaes: I will play wrath but in the end Retail > Retail
[5:42:47] mayonaes: Retail > Wrath*
[5:43:03] Tiamarilien: opt in is on the expansion website and I think your account page.
[5:43:17] Razze89: is there a way to insta cast empowered abliities without empowering/channeling them first? for example if you don't want to get interrupted
[5:43:17] Yagr6: this class seems bad
[5:43:25] Hymirx: they should make an ability like heroic throw from warrior, just to pull
[5:43:35] Moejellini: !alpha

[5:44:10] TwitchOBeats: i heard u cant transmog with evoker is that true? i wouldnt play that class for that reason but thats just my opinion
[5:44:18] MercurialPTDR: If they'd make it normal ranged range it would be super nice
[5:44:22] tahmuu: holy palas are kinda used to that kinda range, no?
[5:44:29] Deekan33: Deekan33 subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 63 months!

[5:44:44] Yagr6: @Daark11 make sense when u @ me
[5:44:50] Dankind64: Maybe they can keep the limited range and add more mobility
[5:45:00] greekttv: to be fair evoker movement is nutty to keep up
[5:45:05] xddDupers: @twitchobeats makes sense why they can’t

[5:46:11] zilzihan: So they just put themselves between current pull and next, and they got you covered all the way
[5:46:57] K4ykay: That's a weird class mechanic
[5:46:59] Frank4LuLz: good luck
[5:47:02] Keffezx: healing savy
[5:47:13] greekttv: that why you typed "Advanced" Kappa

[5:50:53] smashwow: you think they'll release on Thanksgiving week again?

[5:51:15] Dankind64: BIG numbers. WOW
[5:51:18] SilkeySmooth: there isnt enough time for a 3 month beta...lol
[5:51:23] wEiRdO_dUdE: Sales will be insane if they can launch in November

[5:58:44] Funderik: imagine if it was like twilight devo and pulled shit from under you/through walls, oh boy.
[5:58:51] TheCliffyShow: @Yagr6 I'm with you. I think they should just do the DF dungeons for season 1, and start throwing in the old ones with season 2.
[5:59:02] fat_european0: @TheCliffyShow Ion said 2 from legion, 1 from wod & 1 from mop

[6:39:49] Roaringkittylol: Final phase tomorrow?
[6:39:58] Roaringkittylol: Means WW talents???
[6:39:58] Belasard: its more like you can now buy some ressources on lower pop servers, too. i like the change.
[6:40:06] raldrik: wonder if they are going to combine listings or cancel all listings
[6:40:11] edohran: It would require the entire region to not undercut like they do
[6:40:21] vic_ave: they said it will cancel all auctions
[6:40:26] Chopstix2005: its cancel all i think
[6:40:31] Rulem: I can't wait to see the DH class tree.  I bet is a ton of 2/3pt 1% stat increases
[6:40:38] gritbarontv: the price is determined by the user, so AH can be bad or good depending on people
[6:40:41] Chopstix2005: The AH is supposed to start empty on reset
[6:40:43] Kneckt: nah they said they cxancelling them all
[6:40:49] edohran: Right now I can easily buy the servers supply and stabilize the market... Region wide?  off
[6:41:00] utku_liceli: any plans for tower of fantasy ?
[6:41:22] masterbisQc: @Towelliee How's the evoker gameplay
[6:41:42] deadgameenthusiast: do you think it is time for wow to fade?!
[6:41:44] HighThereBud: That would be sweet.
[6:41:51] PrimalRain: if it's global, prices will really tank
[6:41:54] TompsonX: Tower Fantasy didn't look very good to me, I haven't watched much yet tho
[6:42:04] Mecabeast: gonna have some mafias controlling the reagent prices watch
[6:42:05] Belasard: or its a first step to megaservers, someday.
[6:42:13] theoriginalzinng: that could be
[6:42:21] Thenickradice: so I should probably switch my professions then??? I'm max skinning and mining. that's my income haha
[6:42:22] theoriginalzinng: quest says primalist dragon
[6:42:23] SpyCrabbo: being from a small sever, i'm looking forward to it, prices are generally higher when there's fewer people putting stuff in
[6:42:31] wastecasetv: fuck mega servers.
[6:42:40] biirrd: I think one middle ground can be that you have profession "Gatherer", and you mine/herb/skin but you can be extra good at one of them.
[6:42:40] Moobot: We got Discord servers! Featuring giveaways, live twitter feeds, live news from Wowhead, memes, pets and more! Subs even get their own private lounge! Join HERE | discord.gg/towelliee |
[6:42:41] EpicJune: I enjoy it more than Genshin imhp
[6:43:33] edohran: Region-wide is near impossible to control
[6:43:38] Zolshy89: all whales of every server comes togeather
[6:43:47] Zolshy89: lmao
[6:43:49] edohran: who leads the whale?
[6:43:59] vic_ave: Killer whale
[6:44:03] Mecabeast: might also be a way to circumvent the gold cap limit for server transfers
[6:44:39] edohran: I bough out herbs
[6:44:52] dantezalive: no doubt ppl have gold cap on multiple toons
[6:44:52] Zolshy89: also just bc of the ammount of raw gold they have + mats ya
[6:44:56] magemaster225: based on numbers on theunderminejournal, its pretty ez with the goblins
[6:45:48] lalelusa: it's a huge zone but it looks kinda one note design wise
[6:46:02] Bub_Zee: how do you like the new race so far?
[6:46:07] Sollice: Thats typically how zones are they have a theme on them
[6:46:16] Sollice: and different zones are different themes
[6:46:16] SilkeySmooth: who tries to control the auction house in 2022?
[6:46:28] TheCliffyShow: @lalelusa You run into a fantasy forest area later.
[6:46:41] ChiliMoMilli: But Towelliee if it's so easy to play why do they make me type ADVANCED

[6:46:42] cahoots82: Wait, alpha final phase is tomorrow? What does that mean?
[6:46:53] Sollice: @cahoots82 What do you think that means
[6:46:58] foghagymatyi: @cahoots82 now say that again but slower
[6:47:03] wakeandbacon95: pi KEKW
[6:47:07] ItsGigg: Heres a solution, remove power infusion
[6:47:09] PrimalRain: seems like the solution to me
[6:47:13] edohran: make it group wide buff
[6:47:16] cahoots82: How long is the phase?
[6:47:27] duffluv22: GM. Steelers!!!!! Lets go!!!!
[6:47:28] Sollice: @cahoots82 yes
[6:47:28] LeDerpski: If they remove it they have to rework shadow again
[6:47:36] cahoots82: We haven't even seen all of the trees yet. Are we expecting them tomorrow then?
[6:47:45] Sollice: @cahoots82 maybe
[6:47:46] Kneckt: they shouldnt make desicions based on a third party website IMO
[6:47:59] AlphasaurusRexx: @edohran might as well just get rid of it at that point
[6:48:23] Sollice: Great...Remove on use trinkets also please thank you
[6:48:48] KingKelTV: yes plz
[6:48:52] Armdel: ive thought it was a bad thing since the start personally
[6:48:54] Wcvechten: or just make it a personal CD instead of being able to share it
[6:49:01] Rulem: I really dislike their push to make specs bring specific party/raid buffs as well
[6:49:01] johnnythunderbunny: @Wcvechten ^
[6:49:02] biirrd: Or make it a self-cd
[6:49:06] Quite_Nice_: make it a personal
[6:49:07] ParzTV81: just make it ptiest only
[6:49:09] Quite_Nice_: yeah self cd
[6:49:11] Unciatim: just make it Priest only period
[6:49:14] vic_ave: only priest who care are Shadow
[6:49:19] Rulem: at least make them class-wide
[6:49:20] Yagr6: the fact that u can get lust, pi, and use a trinket is all compounding
[6:49:20] edohran: Agree with being removed, then we read the forums about bringing it back
[6:49:31] LunaKura: I personally don't see the issue. It's a good spell for higher end users imo
[6:49:34] AlphasaurusRexx: id be 100% ok with shadow priest going dummy during PI
[6:49:36] KingKelTV: how's that possible?
[6:49:37] abracka_: fuck it, make it a priest raid/group lust and give exhaustion
[6:49:43] Suligane: i have a guy in my guild that legit is toxic when he doesn't get that and Faerie
[6:49:49] Jarlan23: ive never heard a good argument against it. only parsers want it removed tbh thats what it boils down to
[6:49:59] Quite_Nice_: i've got an idea guys
[6:50:01] Walt0107: I feel like it should just be a personal cd for shadow only
[6:50:05] Seerated: I mean, are people so eager to get the buff to get great logs ? People that actually check logs will just see PI is given and that's why the logs are better...think it's just f-n stupid. From a progression standpoint it maters 'cos one dps will do great, all in all it shouldn't matter from a one-person standpoint
[6:50:06] Rulem: they could literally just make it the priest version of lust
[6:50:08] Quite_Nice_: you can only PI the enemy mobs
[6:50:10] Quite_Nice_: hear me out...
[6:50:22] Ariea_Whisper: Should just be a personal cd for priest and that’s it not a big deal at that point imo
[6:50:34] SpyCrabbo: i feel like it falls into a "fantasy rpg vs theorycraft min/max" discussion, because i really like the concept of a spell that buffs a person for a limited time, it's just that people are way too much into bigger numbers in wow
[6:50:42] DiceTry: people are annoyed because of how it will affect an addon.... Blizzard shouldn't be concerned with that
[6:50:49] edohran: Just make it a priest only buff, like recklessnes
[6:50:51] Seerated: ..it still helps out on prog though, so it benefits whole raid
[6:51:01] Rulem: or nerf it slightly and make it party-wide
[6:51:07] LeDerpski: no it does not
[6:51:07] Sollice: So, now more people will play priests lol
[6:51:10] Mecabeast: just make it equivalent to warrior skull banner and have it party wide
[6:51:11] Ariea_Whisper: Shadow doesn’t give it away anyways
[6:51:11] Sluggs_: it just becomes a cd which is fine
[6:51:12] Zolshy89: UKEK
[6:51:12] Sollice: Thats not a bad thing
[6:51:13] kappaday23: no
[6:51:14] vic_ave: its not good for healing priest
[6:51:14] biirrd: dont think so
[6:51:15] Merkuriuz: lol no
[6:51:26] Tamz_tv: they want it to act like a bard style support skill. It just can't stay as a haste bonus. The damage granted from PI needs to be attributed to the priest
[6:51:29] Asyia3: let shadow be meta :(
[6:51:37] Badziee: make it group and raid wide
[6:51:39] Bawpears: Just turn it into a Hero for the Priest class and be done with it
[6:51:40] Ariea_Whisper: The only person that gives it away is holy really
[6:51:47] Unciatim: well hell, let's just nerf all or get rid of all the classes dps CDs
[6:52:21] abracka_: Power Infusion: Increases haste by 30% for all party and raid members for 40 sec. Allies receiving this effect will become Exhausted and unable to benefit from Heroism, Time Warp or Power Infusion again for 10 min.
[6:52:21] Moobot: towHAMUP TOWELLIEE GOT A NEW ORIGIN GAMING PC! | https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-100631756-15027263 towSO |Specs https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/414625240233148419/857136797167779860/orringpc.png | Towelliee Gaming is proud to be sponsored by ORIGIN PC! They have an excellent 24/7 support team, supreme pc build quality and your PC will arrive at your house in a wooden crate!
[6:52:23] abracka_: fixed it
[6:52:25] Sollice: @Tamz_tv Ohhh. Strip all of those CDs from people and roll them in to a bard class! Hooray
[6:52:27] Rulem: @Towelliee think its possible for WCL to do an rDPS like FF14 does on FFlogs?  Then it would be fine, honestly
[6:52:43] wEiRdO_dUdE: True, even casuals are pushed toward the meta
[6:52:45] Zolshy89: raidbots simming wowhead streamers youtube etc. warcraft logs
[6:52:48] Sollice: @Towelliee Yeah...Thats Raidbots for you. When they made it easy to min max shit there you go
[6:52:51] Zolshy89: meta evolved
[6:52:51] KingKelTV: it's partially because the game has gotten harder
[6:52:54] elizondria: its not just big numbers it's the fact that pi makes specs feel significantly better, which encourages toxicity towards priests that pi themselves
[6:52:54] Jarlan23: it is the standard if you wanna do m+ everyone wants meta classes for even low keys
[6:53:07] Kneckt: It still is, its just people think it matters to their gameplay when in reality it dosent because they dont parse high to begin with
[6:53:16] KingKelTV: the harder the game becomes the more it tilts towards metas
[6:53:25] Ant9912: The people complaining about it are people that are logging. Theyre just upset that they cant/wont parse higher than someone that receives it and thats just sad lmao
[6:53:31] Sollice: I play easier classes to get higher DPS lol like Survival
[6:53:34] Seerated: I mean the whining and continous discussion about PI is just ego's wanting to log good, and ofc ALL players want it. I couldn't care less tbh, we all stil lpull our weight if in a raid
[6:53:37] SilkeySmooth: toxic
[6:53:40] dym_jt: They lke to measure their e-peen and top the dps meters, that's all LUL
[6:53:48] edohran: The MDI alone can bring toxic behavior to retail
[6:53:49] Rulem: @Towelliee think its possible for WCL to do an rDPS like FF14 does on FFlogs? Then it would be fine, honestly
[6:53:52] AlphasaurusRexx: there is a PI chart out there that shows dps gain from PI and the difference between the top and bottom is pretty big. that's where all the toxicity comes from
[6:53:54] Thenickradice: change the ability to shadow priest only. new ability: mind control your teammate for 20 seconds increasing damage by 150%. the shadow priest will be left vulnerable to attacks
[6:53:59] Jarlan23: FOTM has always been there but people have taken it a step further than that
[6:54:03] Brumbs: Spit those facts @towelliee
[6:54:07] Sollice: Hell yea 3 buttons and top DPS. My e weiner grows HUGE!
[6:54:11] OhNoNotAgain: @Sollice tell me, went from playing havoc and ret, played surv 1 week and made them look like punks
[6:54:18] Mecabeast: few more weeks till TGP right?
[6:54:27] johnnythunderbunny: that's some DH level rotation
[6:54:28] FezzikGG: Nothing wrong with being excited as your character improves with learning how to make it more efficient.
[6:54:40] Seerated: Yea, Evoker seems to pump hard. Fuck, if they get PI they'll rule the world
[6:54:49] Sollice: @Sollice I am a bad player, but I was doing 2x dps on a sub 260 Survival than I am on my 280 Arms
[6:55:01] Seerated: Hahah
[6:55:03] Darthyrevan: Evoker = New Mage?
[6:55:07] Jarlan23: Arms will do well with PI if test of might is meta
[6:55:09] Sollice: So tell me why I want to keep playing arms, other than plate looks cool
[6:55:16] Jarlan23: because ToM scales really well with haste
[6:55:20] Velashen: I didn’t care for DH for the lack of depth. Seems like this is following the same path.
[6:55:30] OhNoNotAgain: @Sollice someone has to battle shout buff?
[6:55:42] Sollice: Meh..Someone else can do it :)
[6:55:43] Mecabeast: @sollice I find it rough to keep up with any hunter 10ilvls below me as a 289 fury war with a gavel
[6:55:58] Wechselstube: @Darthyrevan mage who can create portal but can flight like a dragon in the old world :D
[6:56:06] wEiRdO_dUdE: towHAMUP towHAMUP towHAMUP
[6:56:09] Sollice: @Mecabeast I was thinking of moving to fury but i cant get a good 2nd weapon. I feel so slow in arms

[6:56:13] OhNoNotAgain: COPIUM
[6:56:14] stallowned: good stream. take care man towHAMUP
