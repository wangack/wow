[1:24:17] uninspire: bro is 6'2 standing on his blizzcon winnings
[1:24:23] Melvred: Blizzard should put more money in PVP. AWC is nice, the game is cool in general but it does not get enough love from Bliz i think. Like Starcraft II.
[1:24:34] VitoBambino: I think Swapxy is by earnings but you and Raiku are now like the most tourneys I think
[1:24:55] poxpoxxd: what do u think about mes
[1:25:02] Melvred: Blizz should also add AI healers for low ratings. and pump the pvp game.
[1:25:04] Barradoso: sry if u said it alot of times, but why did u stop making YT videos?
[1:25:27] uninspire: is there anyone you just dislike playing with?

[1:29:25] Rewenzz: HAHAHA @sind233 so true
[1:29:50] Barradoso: not even multi r1 can trinket a cc that fast
[1:30:20] ayosteviey: 20 min assa que for double pala brutal
[1:30:29] Loadedmvp: @Whaazz here you have the difference https://imgur.com/dyQ8G29
[1:30:35] Melvred: @Whazz What do you think about adding AI healers for low rating, to improve queue times for players. Or make it a choice if you want to queue with AI healer and if it is AI the other team gets one too. I mean there are literally bots outside that play on 2k mmr heal. I dont understand why they are not doing it. I often play heal because I cand stand the queue times on lock or dh.
[1:30:44] adcotv: They ruined assa so much in shuffle.

[1:32:47] Melvred: @A6iyx i dont know, it is like healing is so stressful and feels like most people dont want to be blamed and flamed so why not having a bot do it and of course people if they want to, but separate it. i feel like it would attract players
