[1:27:34] Fomse: !rxp
[1:27:35] bluescholar1: its probably because they mostly made their billions with dirty money and feel the urge to stay mobile :D
[1:27:50] Derezzed01: the 2 runes is shurikan toss and the 10% increased damage one out of stealth
[1:28:01] bry_kryddan: Yes. They are both super expensive show off luxury vehicles

[3:48:33] Lucons1: gym is to gain weight
[3:48:35] PatchesMcPatch: Its not that simple. the body will slow the metabolic rate in adaptation to a lower intake.  studies on women in hospitals showed that they could gain weight on 700 cal/day
[3:48:36] ニューハーフ: air hmmMeeting
[3:48:36] bukayo___saka: he eats spiders for 600 calories while sleeping

[3:48:41] k0kicata: @Istunlocklocalpensioners please dont talk it will be better for others
[3:48:44] darhagest: gym will give you muscle pump, size, but your fat it is all about food that you eat
[3:48:51] Smitty9860: caloric deficit is the way bros. use an app to find the number of calories to maintain your current weight (your basal metabolic weight) and eat underneath that number
[3:48:53] Istunlocklocalpensioners: @k0kicata that's not very nice Mr nadedNerd
[3:48:55] ZetItUp: my cousin went from 140kg to 75kg in 8 months by not eating (got a eating disorder)
[3:48:57] nailerak: calorie deficit is all there is to it; doesn't matter if you get there via more burning (exercise) or less eating
[3:48:57] graveshift69: u can literally eat only doniuts and if ur in a calorie deficit u will lose weight
[3:48:58] freshlife: @PsheroTV bro, people are dumb. I've heard people say they gain weight without eating...
[3:49:02] Adolanius: true
[3:49:10] carrioncorps: we are "hu"mans, we are beings of light KEKW we can use photosynthesis, i saw a YT short on this 100% legit KEKW
[3:49:10] SnazMC: And you > your metabolic rate with cardio, et al. So do cardio and have a caloric deficit if you want to be really efficient
[3:49:17] Ddocz: "most of the calories u burn are passive by existing". yeah but the more muscle mass u have the more calories u burn... so go exercise.
[3:49:21] ZetItUp: "You don't lose weight if you don't eat as much"
[3:49:29] h0t_sauce7: Brain activity also consumes calories
[3:49:35] Smitty9860: gym definitely aids in caloric deficit but at the end of the day, cals in needs to be less than cals out
[3:49:38] Aeycka__: you passively burn about the same amount of calories by doing nothing, as if you run a marathon
[3:49:39] bassiemon123: I have a sluggish thyroid so. Doesnt matter if i eat less, my weight wont drop.
[3:49:41] critske: weight loss and muscle gain are not the same thing @Ddocz
[3:49:44] 1TrevorThompson: Caloric deficit is the way to lose weight full stop - but exercise is what matters for body composition
[3:49:53] Ddocz: @critske you missed my point entirely little dude
[3:49:59] critske: calorie deficit = lose weight
[3:50:02] critske: simple
[3:50:03] Aeycka__: @bassiemon123 google "laws of thermodynamics"

[3:50:25] Istunlocklocalpensioners: how dare you
[3:50:26] Prawlx: @PatchesMcPatch That's not what we are talking about. we are talking about loosing weight on a deficit which is still true. Those woman have a fucked up metabolism and bodies actually not needing more cals, even tho they will get sick probably
[3:50:26] Fatjesus514: lol the chat woke up to preach about caloric deficits OMEGALUL
[3:50:30] Aurheimx: Pshero did you hold someone hostage so blizz would buff mutilate
[3:50:34] ニューハーフ: @bassiemon123 there is no way it works like this, even with hormone problems, you won't get 500 calories from thin air if you ate 1000 for a day
[3:50:39] c0rnholio420: its not my fault im fat, im big boned
[3:50:51] Ddocz: they're not the same thing but they affect each other. peolpe with more muscle mass burn more calories passively because muscle consumes more energy to be maintained than fat. so an individual w 100kg of muscle will burn more calories than an individual w 100kg w less muscle. just to exist.
[3:50:55] Lucons1: i gained 8kg from gym so far i will keep going

[3:52:07] Snooqzz_: @Istunlocklocalpensioners you exercise to gain weight , not loose
[3:52:12] PatchesMcPatch: @Prawlx a regimen of calorie restriction combined with vigorous exercise will cause a thyroid deficiency in anyone.  you cant keep reducing calories until 0 to "keep ahead of the adaptaion"
[3:52:13] c0rnholio420: daylights burning
[3:52:13] Ddocz: @Gale40 no but hormones can affect how food is processed and digested/absorbed in the body
[3:52:18] Ddocz: hence affecting caloric intake

[3:52:20] Istunlocklocalpensioners: I'm trying to help you

[3:53:23] ニューハーフ: when you are at calorie deficit body will burn anything fat or muscules
[3:53:33] Elo1338: You just motivated me to start my walking pad again
[3:53:34] Aeycka__: if you ship the "guys with bad hormones" to a stranded island, guess what, they will all lose weight xD

[3:53:38] struci: @bakerpls mass is not the correct word in that case imo

[3:54:01] 1TrevorThompson: new guild <WHY EAT>
[3:54:04] Lucons1: fasting makes u lose muscle right?
[3:54:06] Ddocz: @PsheroTV most likely you will, depends on the size, age, gender, level of fitness, e.g....but often the body goes into "starvation" mode and it goes into economic mode when u dont eat enough calories, trying to conserve as much energy as it can, reducing the metabolism to a minimum
[3:54:09] urban_wolf: you burn carbs, muscle then fat

[3:58:08] critske: @Istunlocklocalpensioners clueless
[3:58:08] Ddocz: @PsheroTV YES that makes senese. youre at a 1000caloric deficit. BUT the body isn't going to stay burning 2k calories forever passively... your metabolism slows down to adapt to ur caloric intake. Unless you're ACTIVELY burning calories by running and what not, your metabolism will tend to slow down to a point where u burn less calories, coming closer to 1k
[3:58:13] Lucons1: obviously
[3:58:14] Istunlocklocalpensioners: @critske alright fat boy.

[4:00:08] SnazMC: Well, exactly. By that logic you will kill yourself as you get toward 0. So, work out and enjoy your caloric deficit.
[4:00:30] Snooqzz_: i mean all these infos are good and all, but theres a dude that just ate pizza for a year and he remained fit and healthy :)

[4:01:20] ama__deus: @Snooqzz_ nothing inherently wrong about pizza, though. Most people just eat 3000 KCAL diets with pizza in it, instead of 1500 of pizza

[4:02:24] ama__deus: @egolifter9 5'4 as a lifter is a cheat code KEKW
[4:02:25] Ddocz: @PsheroTV Ill give u an example of how people consume 1k calories and have an illusion of not losing weight. If u consume a lot of Processed HFCS (high fructose corn syrup), which is made of 55% fructose 45% glucose, fructose isn't absorbed by the body as energy, it's instead metabolized by the liver converting it straight into fat tissue. so 100% of the calories u consume from sugary drinks and sweets go straight into adipose tissue

[4:03:28] ama__deus: I didn't listen Shruge
[4:03:29] aekovontwitch: Soda is how much fructose
[4:03:33] nailerak: it's kinda true, but you have to have high satiety hormone levels
[4:03:39] AlternateProject: @Ddocz No
[4:03:40] nicoladen: depends on activity
[4:03:41] FUDKillah007: TRUST THE SCIENCE :SOY:

[4:03:44] imitatewater: just lift and you can mostly eat whatever u want and u will have a decent body ( ofc you gotta eat enough protein tho )
[4:03:57] demonzhunter: I think that kinda detail is missing the point
[4:03:58] AeonLiveTV: mostly true, those high processed sugars definitely go to fat

[4:04:13] anthonyk065: hi
[4:04:16] SnazMC: How high?
[4:04:19] ZetItUp: well considering how we looked at weight gain/loss 20 years ago compared to today, what says it doesn't change in 20 years and what we are doing today is "wrong"? :P
[4:04:24] tetenqt: so is any other sugar
[4:04:26] AlternateProject: Man ppl would find any explanation as an excuse to be fat.
[4:04:27] oompous: yeah so an american soda would be a high amount
[4:04:28] zglow92: fructose is sugar?
[4:04:30] bakerpls: @SnazMC 1 kg of muscle occupies 900 ml. › 1 kg of fat occupies 1,111 ml
[4:04:31] 1TrevorThompson: 1000/cal single serving is excessive
[4:04:33] Mark_Neismith: thats why alcoholics usually are fat - even tho they eat a lot less than other ppl
[4:04:40] nailerak: it's basically reverse keto KEKW
[4:04:48] Amprafel: The rent is too damn high
[4:04:52] Lucons1: i can take it GIGACHAD
[4:04:54] Cody_Cross21: Your metabolic rate will usually range between 1800-2500 calories a day for adult males, and on the extreme ends even surpass 3k. So even if you consume 2500 calories in purely fructose and glucose you would stay at maintenance weight?
[4:05:04] Cody_Cross21: are u actually uneducated @StreamElements
[4:05:08] AeonLiveTV: Yeah but for the most part it's obviously not good for you. Processed = bad

[4:05:28] Gale40: @Cody_Cross21 yes you would maintain the weight until you die lol
[4:05:40] 1TrevorThompson: just eat whole foods get some sunlight and fresh air youll be fine
[4:05:41] Ddocz: @AlternateProject for it to be used as energy it has to be turned into glucose or other types of saccharides first dude. our body can't process fructose as energy
[4:05:50] anthonyk065: i have high fructose corn syrup for breakfast
[4:05:51] ニューハーフ: @StreamElements Stare

[4:06:32] Ddocz: @majstorovicjebac fun fact: Keto diet was initially created as a treatment/cure for Seizures
[4:06:37] ama__deus: Though, actually curious now how much energy your body burns in a coma
[4:06:37] SnazMC: @bakerpls Yes.. so as I said, one is less dense

[4:07:05] ama__deus: "Basically how many calories does someone in a coma burn? It depends on person's size, age, and Metabolism. it typically ranges from 1200 - 1800 calories/ day for adults." Damn
[4:07:06] Cody_Cross21: The thermogenic energy expendature is greater in protein consumption, hence why high protein diets will yield greater weight loss on the same flat caloric intake.

[7:58:17] arinn2505: @jarodesc classic is a lot easier, only the raid mechanics require a lot of practice, plus we're bringing 15+ years of raid experience back to the basics so it's a lot easier
[7:58:37] carrioncorps: but will you?
