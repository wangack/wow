[6:00:45] Dbzsauce: yeah it just hinders you if you dont use them sadly
[6:00:46] TalkinBidness: they have to balance retail around them which stinks
[6:00:47] cheeseburgxx: kinda sadge they changed DF tool
[6:00:48] gody_____: I love that you get to customize your UI tho. Playin MMO's without them is a bummer.
[6:00:53] MaloufWoW: tell slyp hi for me :) <3
[6:01:00] StathamFPS: @ihippz thats a reach lmao i played that game on a amateur level the meta guns were maddox and icr and saug no one sniped in competitive play only in pubs and even in pubs snipers werent op at all i hardly ever sniped and didnt have a problem pubstomping
[6:01:00] Gabathot: just play final fantasy :)
[6:01:00] mystlineid: addons suck, just ban them and make ingame ui more customizable.
[6:01:02] vacui_dev: worst thing about addons is that they give functionality/knowledge that you can't get without them
[6:01:04] bangobongo26: i didnt play with addons, but i still raided
[6:01:05] bertyo_: awful take
[6:01:08] PresumedComa: FFXIV is like that

[6:01:17] Glaciul: Yo good tunes
[6:01:18] lottagas: anyone know what server shrouds on? not planning on joining just curious lol
[6:01:26] swordwindgaming: if you want a WoW clone designed to play without addons, theres FFXIV
[6:01:29] mystlineid: 2004 ui
[6:01:33] BeaverSlam: cause the community does it for free LOL
[6:01:34] Justthetip24: yea but ffxiv fights are so setup
[6:01:36] ThePartyFowl: @shroud because addons did the work for them so they wouldn't have to spend the time
[6:01:38] Schlounce: keyComfy
[6:01:39] azayzel: @shroud why not just mute the addon voice if it bothers you so much?
[6:01:42] S4Yun: play eso god luck
[6:01:43] Loading0117: im mexican
[6:01:45] discoteq: wow dragonflight has customizable ui
[6:01:47] izayaishigamevi: is this classic ?
[6:01:48] octane2k: waste of time probs
[6:01:48] MVP_Offensiv: @Number1SydneySweeneyStan not telling you. stream sniper
[6:01:48] Kryten319: because they focused on others

[6:01:54] enirgerep: because the api is so fucking great?
[6:01:57] Akimalul: Shroud Valo isnt gonna grind itself
[6:01:57] ravenarrowz: add ons are very useful. dunno what you mean. XD
[6:02:03] gody_____: Have you seen the new UI updates for Dragonflight? It's getting better for sure. Weakauras still feel like a must tho.
[6:02:04] gort_industries: WoW outsourced to the community. I like that they made the tools availible for the community devs.
[6:02:05] Boxmover: because they want you to scroll through 9 pages of spells on the main bar duh
[6:02:05] aka_yawa: playlist?
[6:02:05] Dirty_Urdi: Customizable ui is a reletively large system to make
[6:02:06] lottagas: @MVP_Offensiv im waiting in a 7k faerlina queue rn i literally wouldnt leave if you paid me
[6:02:10] Rules_Off: peggle loot best loot distribution
[6:02:24] Dustin_S03: @shroud are you maining the pally this expansion or are you just leveling
[6:02:25] snov_gg: Dragonflight is changing the UI issue but addons still have to exist since blizz is currently creating content around those addons and i allowing for more complex fights
[6:02:26] oCallMeViper: KEKW
[6:02:27] educatedbird13: the wow arena competitors compete with out them and still play at a very high level

[6:02:35] MVP_Offensiv: @Number1SydneySweeneyStan another lie from a stream sniper
[6:02:36] azayzel: yeah 4k queue on mankrik
[6:02:39] HeroxStunner: how many 72 on your realm now?
[6:02:42] TahldEQ: It is not that addons are not useful, its the fact that they basically play the game for you so you aren't really having to learn. Trial and error is fun.
[6:02:44] eZidus: !spotify
[6:02:44] garroting: They take away the fun and actually learning the mechanics

[6:02:53] FallenAims: âddons being useful is part of the problem
[6:02:53] sicklys: leave party
[6:02:55] oCallMeViper: HUH
[6:02:56] mystlineid: basically different times, the ui is flawed it worked in 2004 but as players got better and games changed, it wasnt built to last imo, relic of its time
[6:02:58] fragzta28: what dont you like about rap or hip hop?
[6:03:00] sicklys: reinv
[6:03:02] lottagas: @MVP_Offensiv i have better things to do than stalk a streamer in a videogame i just wanted to know how he got around the queues lol, thx anyways nerd
