[7:21:44] qtdewd: Who is Graycen? He's a loser to the WoW community. To his roommates, he's the guy you thankfully don't see much of because he exists mostly at night, and to his viewers, he's a target you can't miss, but most importantly... to his girlfriend, he's a transfer station.

[7:26:05] AceOfFlame: The stuff Asmongold says is just FRIED
[7:26:07] ramenBudgett: asmon deserves to get cooked
[7:26:14] wobven: nope
[7:26:18] POPCOIN: idk but fuck hasan
[7:26:19] Gorakk82: yes he meant social drain
[7:26:19] voidzyxd: who cares KEKW

[7:26:25] B_Rize: What happened with Asmon
[7:26:27] kharma99: what is an asmon?
[7:26:30] Vandkanden94: It was out of context, he clarified after
[7:26:34] AceOfFlame: It's really just Hasan KEKW
[7:26:35] shinezlightz: except when it comesto mitch cuz thats always funny
[7:26:40] BMJR06: asmon farming hate
[7:26:46] Parcelazo: no, he defended the other dude and in the process of defending him, he said out of touch stuff
[7:26:48] AllieQuack: hasan is super pressed
[7:26:49] JaboiParksy: Madge hasWut
[7:26:55] vepsee: asmon just farms drama now lmao

[7:27:24] moa285: I don't watch any of your piece of shit friends, since the leaked call. Stare
[7:27:32] ramenBudgett: @giantpanda ladydimaHi Alex
[7:27:33] AllieQuack: asmons take on the goblin guy was a bit of an L
[7:27:40] AceOfFlame: Thats what he said
[7:27:41] coffeewell: mentaly draining
[7:27:42] B_Rize: LOLLLLLLL
[7:27:43] lol_kovi: hasan is objectively a dumb fuck
[7:27:48] Wubkin: >lose 10k viewers >say something stupid for drama
[7:27:48] AllieQuack: more "soul sucking"
[7:27:50] ramenBudgett: asmon's first mistake was siding with hasan
[7:27:50] AceOfFlame: No
[7:27:52] Gorakk82: he said that but everyone took at harder in general
[7:27:56] B_Rize: Delusional streamers
[7:27:58] DuckSmoke_: He said it drains his social battery and is more soul sucking than a real job.
[7:28:03] watercaltrop: he said  streaming is more soul draining than a real job
[7:28:04] kharma99: Anyone listening to twitch streamers is delusional
[7:28:05] wobven: the internet hates them both
[7:28:08] giantpanda: Should have heard what @Graycen said
[7:28:09] POPCOIN: om
[7:28:11] giantpanda: Was way worse
[7:28:11] Drexnaaul: COOKED and FRIED
[7:28:12] shinezlightz: not much else to say
[7:28:13] voidzyxd: he is tho
[7:28:13] flebbooo: its the truth YEP
[7:28:14] ramenBudgett: he is, almost as dumb as graycen
[7:28:14] rgcrosby: alot of streamers are shitty people though
[7:28:17] OlympicUSA: Honestly, content creation in general is very draining and you feel like you always have to work and get into very bad creative ruts. I’d rather just work a normal job
[7:28:21] Parcelazo: its like king midas except that everything he touch turns to shit
[7:28:22] cowill93: bout sums it up
[7:28:23] Baeroz: From hasan we expect it but asmon came out of left field defending him really out of touch
[7:28:25] AceOfFlame: @DuckSmoke_ Man those surgeons when gotta tell the parents that hey your child is dead right in front of them isnt soul draining at all Kappa
[7:28:27] xTrueEast: have you ever watched a stream???? dude needs a curbstomp
[7:28:29] vepsee: whatevers op
[7:28:31] NotASkiller: Do you feel betrayed that Bean removed your voice from his sound alert redeems?
[7:28:35] lol_kovi: hasan is so far out of touch with reality
[7:28:37] giantpanda: Kappa
[7:28:42] y_u_so_sussy: @graycen They say that because their sisters and moms have pics of him in their rooms
[7:28:48] rgcrosby: hassan is the male pokemane
[7:28:49] vepsee: you always run WOE
[7:28:52] ireallydontlikesushi: he is an out of touch millionaire that says some stupid shit. Nothing has changed since his 9/11 comments he is just hate farming imo
[7:28:52] choppeddx: i just clogged my toilet Sadge
[7:28:53] giantpanda: On a real note; miss seeing you in NoPixel <3
[7:28:58] 123cain: Chatters just malding about millionaires talking about the shit part of streaming
[7:28:58] adam_brisbane: lava burst is near one shot for pvp
[7:29:04] Drexnaaul: disgustang
[7:29:18] ChildishNA: anyone thinks their job is hard. but everyone knows streaming is less work for more money
[7:29:34] OlympicUSA: 2H Enhance with lava burst is gonna be even more insane after reset
[7:29:45] lol_kovi: @ChildishNA only at the very top tho, majority of streamers put in a ton of work 12+ hours for little money
[7:29:46] xTrueEast: yeah whe a man makes 200k a month and tells me im evil yeah curbstomp
[7:29:47] Hokofail: can i start some drama? Agents of Brill are not it as a guild, they have a bad rep in the server!
[7:29:51] giantpanda: @ChildishNA We work everyday and never know if today is the last day we can clock in. Streaming can be pretty mental exhausting at times.
[7:29:53] angrawrxd: he prob towered over u bc hes so tall
[7:29:54] moa285: I thought you saw Hasan all the time, thanks to Ang.
[7:30:02] DuckSmoke_: @AceOfFlame Yeah they have it easy, just like people with manual labor jobs that work 50 hours a week. Bunch of complainers if you ask me.
[7:30:02] AceOfFlame: Enhance and ele are going HARD in phase 2 atm
[7:30:06] Parcelazo: the business model of the other guy is doing the same shit that TMZ does but with politics and is super inflammatory, so its very obvious that no one is going to side with him and asmon understood that after like 3 hours
[7:30:07] choppeddx: nope
[7:30:09] flebbooo: nope
[7:30:12] vepsee: I got a shaman to 10 and deleted it
[7:30:15] Nightbot: Follow my twitter for updates: https://twitter.com/graycen
[7:30:25] y_u_so_sussy: @angrawrxd You should go for him sis
[7:30:26] vepsee: but you playing it for sure makes me not wanna play it even more
[7:30:37] DuckSmoke_: He deleted it because he saw you playing Shaman.
[7:30:46] Nightbot: My second channel is twitch.tv/definitelygraycen
[7:30:47] BMJR06: i blame ziqo
[7:31:03] OlympicUSA: Shaman is getting buffed on reset
