[0:42:17] Mori_Omnibus: @ChubbyMikey bc if u pay them they can get your info to steal more why ask for more when u can just take it
[0:42:25] jawkly: you can get  3 hot and spicy for 3 dollars
[0:42:25] nuzico: @ChubbyMikey no he wants ur paypal to scam u

[0:43:21] imabosssogg: UTILITY, ITS COMING OUT
[0:43:23] bloodshoteyes888: gas em
[0:43:25] Speirslol: you can play this on high with 166p its just a bit stuttery
[0:43:27] ChubbyMikey: I know they don't want literally $3, but none of them mix up. Nonme ask for 4, or 5
[0:43:29] ChubbyMikey: always 3
[0:43:31] Speirslol: 1660
[0:43:41] Jusepist: this is your sign to give me 15 then
[0:43:45] fuserX__: AYAYA

[0:43:57] hampa_0000001: maybe other players could play terrorists, add a cool down if you die to prevent fighting to death every time? just an idea
[0:44:09] OcyrusGaming: shroud turned into power ranger's Alpha ahhyayayayayayaya
[0:44:12] Jusepist: @hampa_0000001 would be hard to balance

[0:44:27] Ultimatesnake93: yayaya
[0:44:28] slappy_zr: I would say go gas masks and use CS gas
[0:44:31] marin5521: @Speirslol aight
[0:44:31] Mori_Omnibus: @hampa_0000001 it wouldnt be a simulator at that point just a pvp game
[0:44:33] slappy_zr: probably the best bet
[0:44:35] quellhorst: Hard to remember, but did this channel move to mixer?
[0:44:39] scalliewagg: @hampa_0000001 yeah it would take some work to balance in favor of the more tactical play, but PVP would be sweet
[0:44:46] BloodNoskie: @quellhorst LOL
[0:44:47] yobson: @hampa_0000001 and they could add agents with unique abilities and gadgets, let the terrorists reinforce walls and stuff too

[0:44:55] GostNZ: how would PVP work though?
[0:45:04] marin5521: it's because it looks really good, so if i had to play it in medium or low id rather not play it

[0:48:02] Babkis: PvE but the current enemy AI is a bit overtuned. They need to fix it. It was honestly better before the release

[0:49:41] RTP_Phillip: staubiiii__ gifted a Tier 1 sub to nrgyze98! They have given 7 Gift Subs in the channel! 
[0:49:49] Babkis: @imabosssogg Fair enough, but this currently doesn't feel like SWAT simulator. It feels like you're fighting elite military forces half the time. They almost never run and hide or even the surrenders are always fake like they have ZERO regards for their lives. I think you're right with looking for something in the middle.
[0:49:51] nrgyze98: @staubiiii__ Danke f√ºr das Geschenkabo!

[0:50:55] imabosssogg: @Babkis I guess the ultimate answer would be tuning it up based on the mission, like the gas station AI should be easier than the data center or something

[0:51:41] Babkis: @Babkis Yeah for sure. You definitely need this game to be challenging but I'd like to see a little more "character" to the AI rather than just always being insane shooters with very little distinction

[0:53:32] DNChew: What game is most similar to this?
[0:53:37] accordinoj: The real meta is to bring 20 flash bangs and just bang every room and 'run the rabbit' with your teammate using live rounds lmfao, those live rounds will make them get on the ground, also why not stack on each other between thresholds, i figure youd watch a few CQB training videos before playing this game, getting old on me shroudy

[1:53:33] Flow56: @shroud How do you like this game so far?
[1:53:44] accordinoj: @Kazeith I'm under the impression that, if you flashbang the suspect, approach the suspect yelling commands and have the live ammo trained on the suspect, they would comply with commands, I mean, if they really want S-tier with lesslethal they (shroud/ska) would have to remain in cover, until they shot the weapons out of their hands AND the second gun (second gun on like every guy) amirite?
[1:54:10] Xxieon: shield
[1:54:25] AceOfHalo2: I need to get me an eotech again. I miss that sight for my AR
[1:54:40] emilianoKrack: hahaha
[1:54:41] accordinoj: Because the suspect continues to try to get up, pick up the gun again, take out a second gun, stand up and run away, the suspect keeps trying to do these things, even when pepperballed and beanbagged, what is the method here?
[1:54:45] Kazeith: @accordinoj well, some hostiles has googles on which deter the effect of flashbangs, so it might not be working all the time but I get your idea

[1:58:15] Kazeith: @revalkingz some enemies has anti-flash googles, but it's always best to entry with flash first than bumrush it
[1:58:22] Sne4keye: DucK96s xD
[1:58:25] Rewdawakening: @hegezzu No
[1:58:28] Kazeith: like you said
[1:58:29] revalkingz: @Kazeith ye fair
[1:58:36] viperz152: is the pepperball rifle thing better than the beanbag rounds in the other rifles?
[1:58:37] hegezzu: @Rewdawakening would be funny tho
[1:58:43] dmm02: what is taking up half the screen
[1:58:45] ST33ZUSx: @Sne4keye Big balled

[1:59:17] ahalle95: sup
[1:59:18] vTango: gas grenades are the way NODDERS
[1:59:19] NGraak: if you shoot the floor/wall with pepper does it make a small zone of gas?
[1:59:21] RedoX_FPS: You're not suppose to use pepper against armored vests
[1:59:21] AceOfHalo2: @SilentDawn217 wont get a good connection, they have body armor on and long sleeves.
[1:59:23] Starcookie122: Im sure the mission doesnt permit it, but thats a real ammo moment right there
[1:59:27] AceOfHalo2: multi layers on too
[1:59:30] PomDeuTair: are you at 6√† fov ??
[1:59:32] PomDeuTair: 60
[1:59:51] lunaticviper12: is discord down?
[1:59:52] Rewdawakening: @Starcookie122 You can play the mission how you want
[2:00:00] Jkist7: pepper balls against armor are much less effective
[2:00:02] BigDaz72: Looks a good time

[2:00:37] Starcookie122: @Rewdawakening oh, had no clue. Is there any reason they are using non-lethal into armed assailants?
[2:00:40] iiiTzMikey: @slayer_odin Same
[2:00:44] DucK96s: @slayer_odin ye
[2:00:45] raulo1987: Discord is broken now

[2:00:59] slayer_odin: only some of my servers
[2:01:01] Rewdawakening: @Starcookie122 They're trying to get an S rank which is the highest rank in a mission.
[2:01:04] Crowbar_Moe: shroud broke discord
[2:01:09] KruptdJello: Only way to get S is non lethal
[2:01:11] tyazheliibolt: they like travel 20 meters

[2:01:28] Starcookie122: @Rewdawakening gotcha. Thank you. I assume the idea is to erase 0 people for S rank?

[2:02:11] jorjyt: whats the basis of this game. br? co-op? deathmatch?
[2:02:17] Rewdawakening: @Starcookie122 Yeah, pretty much. As long as you meet mission requirements you can use lethal force and still get an S rank. They're just doing this because it's hard.
[2:02:26] Fossabot: Follow Mike on Twitter https://twitter.com/shroud
[2:02:28] revalkingz: @jorjyt have you played swat 3 ? kind of the same

[2:02:37] Varn4tz: discord dead?
[2:02:37] king_o_void: man they have all this but not a drone??
[2:02:57] Kazeith: @jorjyt co-op, counter-terrorist kinda like hostage mode, but there's objectives. definitely not BR, not extraction shooter, not pvp
[2:02:59] revalkingz: @jorjyt no you just have to do different swat missions like saving hostages defuse the bomb and so on

[3:40:27] jordhubx: @shadorien XD
[3:40:27] nicolaaddict: @arguello0210 yeah the early development of this game was helped by some of those devs or at least one of em
[3:40:38] xDiiivx: arguello0210 dont know if it has a campaign though, and multiplayer is only coop agains PVE
[3:40:38] djet_black: @Urban_Zamboni you know why they changed that? last i remember was "heres a diff and harder goal there you go" type deal
[3:41:06] djet_black: @xDiiivx @arguello0210 zero hour is the successor of the same studio. far from a good game tho
[3:41:08] Urban_Zamboni: @dexterousfgc not sure but I‚Äôm guessing it‚Äôs to turn the game into one huge narrative experience
[3:41:14] Rewdawakening: LUL LUL
[3:41:22] djet_black: @Urban_Zamboni you reckon thats better than before?
[3:41:23] Juanchoker: this game is pvp or pve?
[3:41:35] ozzy19911: is ready or not worth to buy it? Is someone dissapointed after buy?
[3:41:44] Necrotized: just 2 person ready or not?
[3:41:45] ComplicatedBreakfast: @arguello0210 This game exceeds expectations compared to Swat 4. The devs took a lot of aspects from the game and put their own realistic take on it. RoN also has a very active modding community
[3:42:03] Psychotiker: thank you for your service
[3:42:05] wibxn_: currently have 500 download speeds on stem KEK wtf is this
[3:42:06] nicolaaddict: @ozzy19911 if you are looking for a tactical SWAT simulator then yes 100% worth it
[3:42:06] DrussFR: @ozzy19911 me but it was few month ago before patch ...
[3:42:07] papayamilk_alex: LUL
[3:42:09] PONPOKO_C: hope they do a las vegas casino map
[3:42:10] djet_black: "sad" thing imo is that swat 4 is literally the next best swat game after this. and that game is old as fuck

[3:42:20] jambangerman: That's fair Kappa
[3:42:22] hamedadmiral: Why u go with shild?
[3:42:25] iTheLg: @ozzy19911 It needs few patches to fix some things and crashes, and the cracked AI, but its nice
[3:42:25] Urban_Zamboni: @dexterousfgc I think they should force the obj and difficulty then once u clear it you unlock replayability
[3:42:27] joamdi: thats not crazy you just didnt secure the room :D

[3:45:25] CrypticChaos22: "shot through a door and window after kicking it by ex secret service" "ai cheating"
[3:45:33] Ghaladeon: I think by being 2 officers, going split and flanking at the same time is better

[3:59:13] adev220: Bro's going Rainbow6 in a wheelchair
[3:59:15] BudAfro: hey, there is a reason they call it "less than lethal" and not "non-lethal"

[4:01:52] adev220: How does this compare to Rogue spear?

[4:02:12] Toastedpubes: this reminds me of hearthstone
[4:02:26] BudAfro: @ComplicatedBreakfast i don't know how many goggles would even hold up if you got hit in the face by a rubber ball going that fast
[4:02:30] KCASP: kcaspGGs
[4:02:38] ComplicatedBreakfast: @SGTX_ Thing about how much force it takes to kick down a barricaded door
[4:02:38] Endowen1: @adev220 mmm... Better graphics, more realistic movement, better AI, things like traps, it's more akin to SWAT...
[4:02:44] acman7: @SGTX_ im talking about in the game though bro OMEGALUL its an actual mechanic
[4:02:47] AceOfHalo2: @ComplicatedBreakfast Damn, I thought it was cool your foot steps sounded squishy when they are blacked or red lol. But you can only hear it when someone else walks by you., I have not heard the difference when shroud has had the red or black leg
[4:03:09] adev220: @Endowen1 all sounds good. is there a planning phase akin to RS?
[4:03:12] brandon_94: this game is like donkey Kong country for the snes
[4:03:24] lilmexx34: yurrr
[4:03:28] ComplicatedBreakfast: @AceOfHalo2 Yeah if you kick a door 3 times in a row to knock it down you break your leg
[4:03:35] SGTX_: @SGTX_ that wasn't directed at you, the reply chain notifications are dumb as hell
[4:03:49] roxasxxi: Quack
[4:03:59] AceOfHalo2: @ComplicatedBreakfast every time? i swear i seen shroud and ska kick a door 3 times and were fine
[4:04:00] SIVIoke_: @ComplicatedBreakfast thats why you double leg kick and break both legs

[4:04:40] ComplicatedBreakfast: @AceOfHalo2 Might be a thing of luck then, but yeah consistently kicking a door WILL break your leg
[4:04:52] BudAfro: i like the helmet cam instead of normal spectating, it's a nice touch
[4:05:01] Kwish123: Reading nook
[4:05:02] Trigalti: I have this chair
[4:05:05] ComplicatedBreakfast: @Doggo_is_Lyfe Once in cuffs no, but if you go to arrest them they might pull out a gun or knife up close

[4:18:49] Proksen: There really is no S+ rank i am almost certain. S is the highest rank and no you don't have to take no damage. It USED TO be a thing. Two years ago they changed No injured officers to No officers died. The reason was exactly what Shroud said - too RNG
[4:18:51] sponsoredbykfc: @Snitzyy There's no difficulty, you should've seen the Early Access AI beaming people through walls LUL
[4:18:55] gamingsloth08: @SGTX_ ah okay, thanks
