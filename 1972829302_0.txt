[1:24:40] xxmatosxx1: lost 2 tier rate won 3 damage sounds worth
[1:24:43] Katerrpillarr: The other mages don’t grind as hard and Mary is too scared and won’t play alone or hold onto info very well.
[1:25:00] Potatoe19: Youre already the best at isaac you cant expect to be the best at two things, considering each thing can only have one person whos the best. i think "Best in the guild right now" is good enough all things considered
[1:25:23] Katerrpillarr: I watch so much wow now LUL
[1:25:59] rune11459: i'm here to backseat you @CobaltStreak  what can i backseat you on today?

[1:28:47] nickwtfzorz: played a warrior for classic a few years back was the most painful but rewarding to play end game
[1:28:57] Pyr0m0nkey: Gear dependent as well
[1:29:02] Blaauwe: yeah you can't heal
[1:29:06] Blaauwe: it sucks
[1:29:07] muffintop21: I used to solo with hunter way back when
[1:29:26] frozenbread_: Warrior is mostly a knowledge check, you just gotta know the progression of gear and what you can pull by heart
[1:29:31] biggoh: When I played when wow first came out I played warrior lol I ended up having my dad level me to 60 lol
[1:29:54] rune11459: nice find
[1:29:55] Inaemyel: Do you get to keep your character's name and just start from level 1 if you die, or do you have to delete the character and start again?
[1:31:14] Philaron: is there a possability to sync Switch and Steam Cloud? Or do i have to complete replay isaac?
[1:31:17] MrDropTheSoap: cobaltDance
[1:31:28] rune11459: thanks for continueing the streak @CobaltStreak  i do like it a bit more then the speed runs, cause you can break much more confortably

[1:32:41] Kitkitten_: Yesterday was awesome
[1:32:49] Blaauwe: That run was crazy

[1:34:37] powder_mountain: its a bonus being home sick but getting to watch cobalt
[1:34:38] rune11459: to be fair, i kinda like the greedier rounds in speedruns, but as they are in that, its no breakinging in speeding the greediers
[1:34:48] Inaemyel: Man, binding of isaac streams could really benefit from a "slay the relic"-like integration. I'd love to just click a button and see what items you have and what they do, especially with this character.
[1:35:16] rune11459: closest available is the item description mod
[1:35:28] rune11459: but thats only in the players screen

[1:39:11] KinglyCourt: T-Eden reminds me of this audio I heard once that's just like. "Remember, kids - if you don't like who you are, you're always one incident from being a completely different person" or something like that

[1:39:21] Dyroco: ty
[1:39:25] archeonlotet: @rune11459 lol
[1:39:46] rune11459: the only technically non cosmetic is the item description mod for chat
[1:39:53] Kitkitten_: true
[1:40:04] rune11459: cobalt does strictly for chat
[1:40:23] rune11459: and cobalt turns off it for speed runs
[1:40:25] HoboB0B_: cobaltW
[1:40:27] 999avatar999: knife gonna be booring af here

[1:40:36] xviper29: Both
[1:40:49] DarkMeos: i think the only real problem with the item descriptions is the help it gives for the holdinmg bag and the spindown counter
[1:40:55] 999avatar999: wait, teef synergize with knife?
[1:41:03] rune11459: it also describes pills and cards

[1:42:15] Egowar: also the description is on screen so briefly that us noobs dont even benefit from it, i think
[1:42:16] somerandomdude21: you can disable that in mod settings
[1:42:17] ElectricAxel: You can turn that off, but I think the speedrun rules called out the item description as not allowed.
