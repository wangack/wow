[0:24:33] ImHomegr0wn: do you ever consciously check your mastery buff on your characters that run double mastery in the starting room? especially in tournaments. I made a WA today because I was curious. Mine is broken sooooooo often
[0:24:56] krome2dadome: @Anhak we did not, but the axe made up for it
[0:25:12] ImHomegr0wn: yeah first round of shuffle but even if I don't relog or anything, it can break next game too. that's so annoying
[0:25:14] Anhak: axe? u mean fist that we didnt get KEKW
[0:25:37] krome2dadome: shitty fist anyways
[0:25:46] Anhak: na that fisty is crazy
[0:25:48] ImHomegr0wn: so I just wrote a tooltip checker WA that loads in the starting room to say "mastery buff bugged" and then I can switch
[0:25:58] krome2dadome: beta fist weilders
[0:26:15] ImHomegr0wn: hmm yeah I might do that but for now the WA making me aware that it's bugged is really nice
[0:26:39] ImHomegr0wn: I've probably queued so many games with just 1 mastery buff active when I forget to check haha

[0:29:36] ImHomegr0wn: so weird that it's syncing SO FAR back
[0:30:08] ImHomegr0wn: ahh ok
[0:30:23] ImHomegr0wn: yeah ever since I lost my UI I think back in legion too, I always back up my wtf folder lol
[0:30:45] ImHomegr0wn: was in arena when servers went down and came back to no UI on reset
[0:32:58] krome2dadome: is it a myslot problem or like an actual game problem? i dont understand

[1:16:08] Anhak: i unironicly kinda wanna give it to our healing shammy
[1:16:13] Anhak: he melee weaves a lot
[1:18:08] atoker: you're missing bracers
[1:18:24] Anhak: ALSO the uh 30% nerf isnt a 30% nerf its they removed your requirment for using 2 of the same wep which should inc your non raptor strike damage but you will lose somewhere neer 30% raptor strike damage. its gonna be like a 10% nerfish its big but its not 30% gutting like some people thingk
[1:18:49] rocif40: whens the tournament
[1:19:18] rocif40: sick
[1:19:20] Anhak: o i 100% agree thats why i was asking you the other night cause u said that before and then u were like eh maybe the other night.
[1:20:34] Anhak: if u dont want to play it dont. I think im gonna ask Raggle if we will weave if we get it again. that was kinda the plan all along. I kinda want one for later on if they buff.change rogue but its not my prio at all
[1:21:13] Anhak: I also think with the boomkin changes and stuff were really close to be able to 1 heal most of the fights
[1:22:05] Anhak: warlock is so much tankier and doing 60 70 95 hps so really its just kinda topping the raid for a big part
[1:22:24] Anhak: we 1 shot everything
[1:23:05] Anhak: had an accidental pull on 6000 and then they fucking made reseting last boss after MM harder which kinda sucks cause its the same room..
[1:23:33] Anhak: 1 trash wipe cause the hallway before last is uh.. bad lmao
[1:23:47] Anhak: but really smooth otherwise i think like 1 hour 10? 15 mins?

[2:49:07] dawsonator171: Glimpse and chaotic imprint always.
[2:49:25] dawsonator171: third one is flexible but commonly detainment.
[2:49:33] pavic: @dawsonator171 yeah i figured that
[2:49:48] dawsonator171: never use the immo cleanse into aff
[2:49:50] pavic: ive been playing blood moon mostly as 3rd
[2:49:52] dawsonator171: or sp
[2:50:24] pavic: what about ele?

[2:50:51] dawsonator171: it's really annoying for them.
[2:51:31] dawsonator171: detainment is huge deny so it's really good to play in 90% of situations.

[4:51:10] Axtin: idk if im convinced that stacking omega vers is worth on ret
[4:51:48] Axtin: yeah im not stacking mastery but im not going above the 20% dr for vers
[4:53:32] Axtin: well you cant really stack a whole lot after that
[4:53:41] frazzoqt: i seen one guy on eu ladder stacking crit
[4:53:49] Axtin: whatever you pick after 20% vers dr is gonna be minor
[4:53:53] frazzoqt: yea

[4:55:04] waitimdesyncd: mesHi
[4:55:57] UltraKaos: stacking full versa mastery atm on ret, playing vanguard... it is slow but fun, smacking people around pretty good where im at(2kish solo mmr)

[4:57:01] Axtin: ya its minor for sure
[5:00:35] Tiebot87: the "retpocolpse" isent even close to the DH meta we have this expansion.. last night around 2200mmr 3s, 8of10 games had a DH
[5:01:43] Axtin: ret was def more insane than dh now, 3-4 rets every shuffle
[5:02:53] Axtin: dh right now is prob about the same as aug last season
[5:03:06] Devcomz: its debatable I hear what Axtin and Tiebot say frequently people have different opinions on it but both are bad for sure
[5:04:00] IAmBlue1337: Its actually crazy how many have switched to dh, as for most of season 1 and 2 (besides start of S1) Havoc was one of the lower represented specs in pvp close to dks
[5:04:18] Devcomz: One my characters had 2 double DH lobbies and then a triple DH lobby and I just rage quit the triple Dh lobby. I couldnt handle it anymore

[5:12:21] IAmBlue1337: Yea, I mostly just compare classes
[5:13:19] IAmBlue1337: I mean if DH had more dps specs it would be more spread as well, so you cant really just compare havoc to lets say bm

[5:14:57] bigmancamx: @notmes haven‚Äôt people always been playing what‚Äôs fotm? aside from like bfa when you could literally never catch up
[5:15:16] IAmBlue1337: It also makes it worse if the playstyles for specs that are FOTM are easy to learn, like for DH for example
[5:16:01] waitimdesyncd: But if they made the rankings about being a certain % of your spec. Like it shows if youre a top 1% Unholy DK etc, instead of a arbitrary number that says much different depending on the opness of your spec
