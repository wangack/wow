[0:50:04] mohaso21: you used portal again earlier?
[0:50:05] Eliannoula: KEKW
[0:50:08] mohaso21: what did i say about using it
[0:50:15] alishoop: thats what you think
[0:50:46] mohaso21: everytime you use portal you wipe, its not my fault
[0:51:25] tvilk: in my experience, assigning interrupts goes great on the first cast and then after that its full yolo
[0:51:53] mohaso21: ye that does sound like alot of sense to me
[0:52:11] tvilk: yeah but
[0:52:12] tvilk: pugs
[0:52:20] stillsuitstk: Zug life
[0:52:25] yujik46: @tvilk pug keys always go better when u join the group no discussion about the key and just full yolo
[0:52:38] kushlul: !beardchallenge
[0:52:39] tvilk: one person will wait till the end of cast and then another gets anxious and uses interrupt instead so now you wasted 2 interrupts on the same mob
[0:52:44] tvilk: and then 1 mob doesnt get interrupted
[0:52:49] tvilk: and it just puts the group in shambles
[0:53:26] kushlul: ill try my best
[0:53:28] EmElw: he could do a techno viking bit
[0:53:37] tvilk: thats a mr beast video right there

[1:05:09] Echo_Esports: Celebrate Echo's latest win in the RWF with the New World First mousepad and loads of other great merch at echogg.ly/merch/Scripe
[1:05:17] mohaso21: its dps los
[1:05:24] tvilk: didnt interrupt at all this pull
[1:05:56] mohaso21: and he continues to not do it
[1:06:00] tvilk: yep
[1:06:22] tvilk: scripe has used 2 major defensives to mitigate the thorns damage, meanwhile this mage could just interrupt 1 time maybe idk
[1:06:42] mohaso21: its insane how he is getting away with that
[1:06:45] RichardPPPan: Hmm
[1:06:49] tvilk: look at overall interrupts
[1:06:51] tvilk: KEKW
[1:07:01] mohaso21: XD
[1:07:46] mohaso21: ye as long as at least one of them interrupts then iam happy i guess
[1:07:47] tvilk: 30 stacking on a 29 monka
[1:07:56] BRGShadow: do you always stack up hotstreak before you go into skb?
[1:08:19] mohaso21: tvilk its fine i didn't reset at all in a 28
[1:08:56] tvilk: @BRGShadow you stack it up so you can fire 1 pyro into another pyro with FB in between depending on travel time.. It lets you insta get hotstreak stack again
[1:09:03] tvilk: @mohaso21 guess im shit then
[1:09:10] fNzoN1: !boost
[1:09:10] Echo_Esports: Scripe is boosted FeelsWeirdMan Ok but for real: echogg.ly/boost/Scripe

[1:14:09] katu1: gorger aggro is bugged
[1:14:09] yujik46: they melee people xd
[1:14:11] mohaso21: its a bug

[1:14:15] Echo_Esports: Yooo i yoinked a Staforge PC. Best choice of my life . Go yoink yours at: echogg.ly/starforge/Scripe
[1:14:26] tvilk: If you taunt they stop, or CC them
[1:14:40] mohaso21: they jump on someone and start randomly attacking that person
[1:14:50] tvilk: its like fixate but not really
[1:14:53] tvilk: and also only sometimes
[1:14:59] tvilk: and can be stopped with a taunt
[1:15:14] tvilk: but its not aggro loss so tank doesn't know Okayge
[1:15:15] mohaso21: thats why everytime they jump tank need to either insta taunt or cc stun them
[1:15:50] mohaso21: i know this stupid bug so it almost never happens in my runs
[1:16:03] tvilk: i just hate this part in general
[1:16:06] wkd_blaze: love corridors
[1:16:25] mohaso21: darkness down = tank struggling to live

[1:32:57] tvilk: both work
[1:33:00] mohaso21: ^^
[1:33:14] Camm_23: yeah they are really good
[1:33:16] tvilk: They are the same, but different. It's all about which you prefer
[1:33:26] Beach2k18: they need to uppdate the lfg system for m+. like a solo que or duo que. u  can choos if u want to list on solo
[1:33:35] Camm_23: then just set a filter for like 28-28 to only show that key in the 28 range
[1:33:50] Camm_23: so you tick the ones you want to see
[1:33:51] insanejihoon: I'd play without UI addons if Blizzard ones were good
[1:33:53] tvilk: I prefer Premade Group Finder because it's much easier on the UI @Scripe
[1:34:15] nemo1tn: in advanced filter expression u can
[1:34:34] tvilk: You check which dungeons you want to do and then insert like 28-28 and it will show you all keys in that dungeon range
[1:34:59] mohaso21: KEKW
[1:35:13] domax92: insta invited for hc LUL

[1:37:07] Basilwheat: PGF is way better
[1:37:09] Juggarnautt: Quick Question scripe for raiding how important do you think the ret aura is ? guild deciding between 2 Blood DK and 1 Blood 1 Pally. We working on Mythic SMoldy atm
[1:37:17] uncivil82: the UI design dosent get much worse does it ?
[1:37:23] tvilk: Select the dungeon and then type 27-27 its very simple

[1:37:40] toyfluffy: on the github of PGF you can find the advanced filter documentation
[1:37:44] stagpul: N OmegaFPortrait
[1:37:51] Nightbot: @toyfluffy -> I'm only trying to help. [stop posting links] [warning]
[1:38:22] mohaso21: KEKW
[1:38:25] mohaso21: what have you done tvilk
[1:38:35] tvilk: i dont know i dont use premade group filter
[1:38:36] lissaiyanna: The icons don't look like that on mine, for sure
[1:38:47] tvilk: if you know what you need
[1:38:48] tvilk: just search
[1:38:51] tvilk: 27-27
[1:38:51] domax92: i see you want an option that only shows keys that gives you score
[1:38:56] mypovtm: uhh scripe, the icons arent part of the addon
[1:38:56] domax92: that you didn't time yet
[1:39:00] mypovtm: that's something else
[1:39:00] mohaso21: ye then click on the dungeons that you need
[1:39:03] Gaelama: Just click the ticks on the right side
[1:39:08] Basilwheat: u click the dungeons
[1:39:31] toyfluffy: Addons arent Able to filter by Group names anymore, that was patched out in BFA
[1:39:53] tvilk: try (eb = 28) or (dht = 27) maybe
[1:40:00] mypovtm: put 28-28 in your search bar after selecting the dung @Scripe
[1:40:12] mypovtm: it'll only show you dungs you have selected
[1:40:31] Justflux: just type 28 in the dungeons bit?
[1:40:35] Raplordlol: you put the difficulty in the search bar then click reset, then click the dungeons u want
[1:40:58] domax92: i do and i didn't know there was an advance option that let you do that
[1:41:03] Johnernnn: COPIUM
[1:41:05] stagpul: KEKW
[1:41:08] Nosferatas: it's not possible what you are trying to do
[1:41:09] tvilk: unselect all the dungeons and type in the advanced filter
[1:41:12] tvilk: try (eb = 28) or (dht = 27) maybe
[1:41:13] Raplordlol: nah cant do that
[1:41:16] Nosferatas: tried looking for that aswell
[1:41:21] tvilk: try "(eb = 28) or (dht = 27)" maybe
[1:41:24] mypovtm: you cant do that pretty sure
[1:41:26] domax92: you only want keys that gives you score
[1:41:27] Echo_Esports: Grab your fantastic new Displates for up to 33% off! Use echogg.ly/displate/Scripe and enter code: ECHO

[1:42:04] toyfluffy: they patched that out, its not possible anymore, because you have to filter it by Group names, but addons cant do that
[1:42:16] tvilk: on the error it shows "Tanks=1" so maybe remove the spaces?
[1:42:35] Camm_23: I think you can only filter by level in the Blizzard Group Finder
[1:42:41] Buzzzcraft: to target farm loot
[1:42:44] Buzzzcraft: @Scripe
[1:43:25] Nightbot: @cinderfelltv -> moon2A [stop posting links] [warning]

[1:44:14] ZagaTaga: sadly u cant filter "most needed"
[1:44:17] tvilk: @Scripe There's a keyword called "mydungeonrating" Current player's score of the listed dungeon
[1:44:39] Beach2k18: u should make one new addon
[1:44:46] tvilk: So you could search EB and then say "mydungeonrating" to have it show keys that are above a set level or something like it
[1:44:51] RichardPPPan: Hmm
[1:45:13] freeederikke: I'm reading a post rn about this @Scripe .. they said it used to be possible but blizz disabled it.
[1:45:21] ravennl: you can type here the name of the dung and add +27

[1:46:53] toyfluffy: you have to use myaffixrating
[1:47:07] tvilk: idk look at the link it will explain it

[1:49:23] ZagaTaga: 450
[1:49:26] zomekk: do dungeon rating over 450

[1:51:16] Fjordir: you can do 29 in search bar and "(dht or tott or eb)" in pgf
[1:51:17] mohaso21: cuz they are overlapping
[1:51:32] mypovtm: its a diff addon doing that
[1:51:39] mohaso21: it doesn't overwrite the blizzard one
[1:51:43] mohaso21: just overlaps it
[1:51:47] tvilk: so do 29-29 atal
[1:51:59] tvilk: putting 29-29 shows only 29 keys
[1:52:09] Basilwheat: did u see the 2 chest +31 Atal?
[1:52:21] tvilk: idk if putting "atal" works
