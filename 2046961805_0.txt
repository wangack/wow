[0:51:07] dawsonator171: you'
[0:51:09] dawsonator171: are fine
[0:51:24] dawsonator171: @nikthevoker i feel like you're a little picky sometimes.
[0:51:27] nikthevoker: 2.3cr 2.5ish mmr
[0:51:39] happyheals: hopefully the chaanges I made and straightening my ui up helps
[0:52:09] nikthevoker: i dont invite people i hace a feeling im gonna have to teach LLUL
[0:52:30] nikthevoker: depending on mood
[0:52:37] dawsonator171: I'll never learn stinky breath without a tutor
[0:53:10] happyheals: Evokers are gonna go extinct
[0:53:15] nikthevoker: i barely know that comp, i was just playing Unh/dev no comms
[0:53:19] happyheals: Droppin bombs on em

[0:56:10] ThisIsJesusx: clawing build is better?
[0:59:23] ThisIsJesusx: LOL so close
[0:59:31] michaelss_: Mes can you try play unholy commander build with gargoyle and full pet dmg to test it !
[0:59:38] dawsonator171: do you ever try to get the DC debuff stack to 10 before bursting?
[0:59:40] yeah_buddy: that’s an awful matchup
[0:59:44] americanmoses18: pet dam build soooks
[0:59:48] yeah_buddy: for dk
[0:59:51] Thorgood2: how u going mes:)
[1:00:12] michaelss_: what about no Ua
[1:00:49] ThisIsJesusx: without superstain i think you'll have problem with rp
[1:02:06] wEiRdO_dUdE: Crazy boomkins
[1:04:17] krome2dadome: i hate boomies man
[1:04:17] Moobot: Join my Discord community! https://discord.gg/mes
[1:04:47] wEiRdO_dUdE: I watched Venruki on arcane mage doing mega damage like that to unholy DK's. He blew right through AMS and nuked them pretty good
[1:05:17] krome2dadome: i hate arcane mages too
[1:05:33] ThisIsJesusx: yeah arcane is nasty
[1:05:57] ThisIsJesusx: but udk can to kill arcane, it's mostly problem for warriors
[1:06:08] krome2dadome: nothing can kill arcane
[1:06:29] ThisIsJesusx: sp can, unholy dk can :D
[1:06:36] krome2dadome: wrong
[1:06:53] ThisIsJesusx: lock too can to do it, depends by team
[1:07:00] ThisIsJesusx: also ele is really problem for mages
[1:07:31] krome2dadome: nothing is a problem for arcane mages
[1:07:51] ripinpeace10: is blood worth gearing for?
[1:08:04] ThisIsJesusx: for mages always problem is another caster, you can ask them too :D
[1:08:20] ripinpeace10: would it be good with fury war in arena
[1:08:20] mouro52: which class does the most dmg in a game?
[1:08:38] wEiRdO_dUdE: It seemed like hunter is still the one that scares mages most
[1:09:33] ThisIsJesusx: @mouro52 i think it's dh :D
[1:10:03] dawsonator171: mages are afraid of nothing.
[1:10:14] TheMagicCactus: when do you play Plaguebringer vs Clawing shadows anyone know?
[1:10:16] dawsonator171: they just slurp all game long

[1:23:15] Lythi: morning Mes!
[1:23:50] Lythi: doing great man, super excited for the week. how are you? how is prac coming along?
[1:24:40] nikthevoker: wonder about going cheese build with skyfury
[1:24:40] Moobot: Tshirts, hoodies, and mugs available now! https://merch.streamelements.com/notmes
[1:25:04] dawsonator171: Which cheese build?
[1:25:17] nikthevoker: like have some crit on DH and rsham for stormkeeper go, you should be able to crit a couple and 1 tap LUL
[1:25:32] nikthevoker: with DK/dh/stormkeeper rsham
[1:27:15] Lythi: btw Mes, would it be okay if i restream your PoV for the Open Bracket games to do some casting? no worries if not ofc jakbNICE
[1:27:58] krome2dadome: mes
[1:28:04] wEiRdO_dUdE: I definitely want to watch the open bracket action, good stuff
[1:28:11] krome2dadome: what’s ur #1 wish for pvp in the new expansion?
[1:28:47] Recyclemanx: did you ever have the nickname dick simp growing up
[1:29:33] dawsonator171: simp didn't have a meaning growing up.
[1:29:59] wEiRdO_dUdE: The dev preview that showed DK hero talents for War Within looked cool
[1:30:37] americanmoses18: careful now @Recyclemanx
[1:30:55] nikthevoker: when is the new expac coming? i really need to save some money for both accounts LUL
[1:31:01] Lythi: cheers! yeah cdew at some point said "i dont care, so dont ask me" so i´m just rolling with that LUL
[1:31:02] americanmoses18: august prolly
[1:31:58] nikthevoker: ok so i got time
[1:32:23] dawsonator171: last one got gifted to nik
[1:34:29] krome2dadome: @notmes what’s ur #1 wish for pvp in the next expansion?
[1:34:46] wEiRdO_dUdE: Almost had that kitty
[1:35:32] krome2dadome: mine is delete precog
[1:35:47] Thorgood2: do u tihnk there will be any spicy comps in awc
[1:35:49] ripinpeace10: unpopular opinion bring back templates from legion
[1:36:24] happyheals: rogues die instantly if stealthed >30 seconds
[1:36:29] krome2dadome: make pvp gear good in pve
[1:36:52] happyheals: pvp raid bosses
[1:36:59] wowsuomi: What if u could fight ai bots put in by the game
[1:37:12] wEiRdO_dUdE: That's a real point and there are quite a few PvX players, they just need a good reason to be in PvP
[1:37:16] wowsuomi: To fix shuffle q's
[1:37:18] happyheals: thats what im sayin a rated comp stomp
[1:37:27] krome2dadome: already do that half the time I fight an ele @wowsuomi
[1:37:28] ripinpeace10: i really liked tbc gearing for arena like pve wasnt insanely required but there were some big pve items. not like wrath tho where half ur gear is pve @notmes
[1:37:40] BasicSnake: "encourage" becomes force very fast, and force is very bad for motivation
[1:38:30] wEiRdO_dUdE: Yeah season 1 of Shadowlands basically forced a lot of high end PvE people to get carries in PvP and that was kind of ugly
[1:38:36] wowsuomi: It would be like mage tower but in
[1:38:52] Lythi: i think gearing is pretty good atm. i´d like a few more sources of conquest that you can farm if you´re late to the season and undergeared
[1:39:03] happyheals: giving some classes more tools for their toolkit while just giving some classes more damage is a horrible idea
[1:39:19] happyheals: the damage just gets nerfed eventually, while the tools stay
[1:40:49] wowsuomi: Be cool if u got to high rating and the ai becomes unbeatable
[1:41:00] wEiRdO_dUdE: Nice!
[1:41:09] stljay73: Taking the PvP row out of the vault will be a good stepin seperating the two
[1:41:48] uninstallspeedrun: more like 100:1
[1:42:05] ripinpeace10: @notmes : i really liked tbc gearing for arena like pve wasnt insanely required but there were some big pve items. not like wrath tho where half ur gear is pve did you like tbc gearing?
[1:42:08] oldmatevis: No one enjoys farming gear for pvp
[1:42:21] Lythi: PvP should be seperated from the leveling process
[1:42:22] krome2dadome: idc what they do as long as precog doesn’t exist or they at least give melee some kind of real counterplay
[1:42:38] TheMagicCactus: I feel like pvps hard for non pvpers to get into
[1:42:48] happyheals: make a pvp quest where if you fill all 3 vault slots with rated pvp you get a socket. Make it on a bi-weekly basis
[1:42:52] BasicSnake: The best way to have and overlap is to reduce the entry requirement to pvp, and gear is the biggest hinderance to pvp, if you had a "no gear" solution to pvp, it would be easier to get going for pve players in pvp
[1:43:41] wowsuomi: what if u could q into a 3s team that is fully ai
[1:43:53] wEiRdO_dUdE: Yeah having all gear scale up close in PvP would make it easier for PvE people to jump into PvP
[1:43:55] ConchubarOD: 0% chance I would want my intro to pvp to be healing shuffle 3s
[1:44:06] mouro52: They need to make pvp easier tbh
[1:44:08] happyheals: I am done doing rdruid games. The last 5 or 6 solo qs have had people just afk or leave or whatever
[1:44:17] Lythi: word
[1:44:31] happyheals: going 4-2 or 5-1 and getting 1 rating at 1520
[1:45:02] happyheals: corruption is the dream life
[1:45:02] Moobot: Join my Discord community! https://discord.gg/mes
[1:45:11] ghostgalx: i think thats something that classic does right, the pvpers and pve:ers mingle with eachother
[1:45:29] Lythi: see, this is another reason why i love your streams. you got good takes
[1:45:31] mouro52: Every1 I know played pvp in s1 of SL
[1:45:35] mouro52: it was genuinely so much fun
[1:46:06] happyheals: make seasonal achioevements or titles for rankings in pvp and pve
[1:46:17] stljay73: As a person that does not do PvP but love to watch i would agree, but PvP seems just to complicated to play for me
[1:46:43] wEiRdO_dUdE: Season 1 of expansions is always probably going to have the highest population, so yeah they need to do it at the start of War Within, whatever they do
[1:46:45] happyheals: I zug zug every class
[1:47:03] americanmoses18: i just get my 1800s done and leave pvp lols
[1:47:09] americanmoses18: mogs is all im there for
[1:47:15] Lythi: i feel like its an interesting discussion to have if making WoW pvp less complex would be good or bad
[1:48:55] wEiRdO_dUdE: A bunch of us are going to be in the beta for the expansion this time, so we will need to be sure to give them feedback during it
[1:49:00] krome2dadome: I think there’s a balance between speed and complexity that needs to be reached @lythi nobody likes dying in 0.5 seconds and nobody like dying to a dev evoker channeling 1 button
[1:49:25] Lythi: i´m mostly thinking from the angle of approachability you know? less complexity = easier to get into
[1:49:30] Lythi: @krome2dadome yeah good point
[1:49:45] Lythi: yeah, really good way to look aat it
[1:50:07] wowsuomi: 420
[1:50:23] wEiRdO_dUdE: True
[1:50:38] americanmoses18: fuck dragon for real opener and 1 disintegrate and im already thru 3 buttons and 10% health
[1:50:41] jBeastwood: late stage wow pvp

[1:54:16] wEiRdO_dUdE: Allowing PvErs to do part of their rep grinds in PvP would be one incentive the devs could add easily
[1:55:33] uninstallspeedrun: do you think soloque rbg could revitalize pvp for those who arent interested in arena? feel like the barrier to entry to soloque rbg would be way lower vs arenas
[1:56:24] boomerqt: I played pvp back in 2008 when it was easy,i could never track so much of this now im too old for this shit LUL

[6:27:15] OaksDot: God I love playing disc in SS, it's so hectic and you're constantly like "oh ok, I got this to counter that, etc."
[6:27:53] saiyan333: Get comfy keeping everyone alive, then gradually mix dmg and setups in
[6:29:12] OaksDot: Scream seems really good in this patch too, can get some cheeky 2/3 screams off in SS and it's not gonna break insta when your dps goes full zug zug.
[6:30:11] popzirl: Much better keeping hots up
[6:30:28] thunderstud25: I’m being dumb on ret but with 4 set is it worth running double blade and double judge? single blade double judge or double blade and single judge?

[7:32:28] Dudewuut: how much mastery do you run with it
[7:32:42] Dudewuut: and do you still run 4set for the damage amp
[7:32:44] SebboTheFro: I agree, Ive been resistant to pålaying plaguebringer all along, Im more interested in how haste vs mastery is with clawing
[7:33:43] archtme: can you still download mesui_castbars somewhere?
[7:33:46] SebboTheFro: Yeah thats night and day
[7:34:02] wowsuomi: My haste is really slow during the day
[7:34:31] Dudewuut: do you feel you could drop some haste for mastery if you wanted to swap builds
[7:34:33] SebboTheFro: And what would be the downside to playing this haste heavy clawing build but still dropping magus and set? @notmes
[7:36:12] SebboTheFro: Okay so in short you could still drop the set if you really wanted to min/max secondary but outside of that theres really no diff
[7:37:16] Dudewuut: i feel the higher haste build would be better with legendary weapon
[7:37:16] Moobot: Join my Discord community! https://discord.gg/mes

[7:38:48] Dudewuut: with more procs though it will most likely align or at least the sustain is there with more haste
[7:38:59] zachgamegodx: we need a PI with that
[7:39:01] SebboTheFro: I wonder if there is a world where you can drop some of the haste you currently have for 1 point in talons
[7:39:18] zachgamegodx: what if you played all mastery with Ryan on outlaw

[9:29:42] ZealotryTV: rbgs are so weird. one team is giga pumpers the next just falls over
[9:30:27] sunileif: need more rbg teams
[9:30:46] sunileif: increase insentives
[9:31:06] vantary: i meant instead of udk in that comp, so demo/ret demo/dh

[10:02:34] qabraa: daaaaam
[10:02:48] ZealotryTV: for pvp?
[10:02:56] happyheals: it feels like too often classes get nerfed that don't need it while others just get left alone for too long
[10:03:07] waitimdesyncd: rogue and dh shouldnt be good :) just let me decide Kappa
[10:03:13] sunileif: with an intern some grappa and a dart board
[10:03:24] cookietime95: does that mean possibly mesvoker soon?

[10:05:03] sunileif: you were experiancing an alternate reality where mesvoker was a thing
[10:05:33] happyheals: the problem seems to be when they give a class abilities that don't by themselves do damage  or affect defensives that can be used as offensives
[10:05:55] dicromickdk: how bad is dk right now?
[10:06:29] qabraa: what i have done mods :C ?
