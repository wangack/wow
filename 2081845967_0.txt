[0:09:48] PapitoFred: @Berrasw3 @VintageLock Hejsan! papito29Hey papito29Love  @Snowmixy Hej kompis, varför har du inte den där coola legendariska yxan som jag ser så många andra ha? Varför slackar du? Fixa yxan, den är faktiskt rätt bra. Det är sant, jag ljuger inte. Anyway, jag äter kalkonsmörgås med saltgurka för att jag kan :)
[0:10:10] VintageLock: @PapitoFred papito29Love hej
[0:10:15] Berrasw3: HEJ FRED! <3 det låter som en god macka
[0:10:15] Faeynna: Köpte 2kg choklad igår för att baka med inför imorgon.. tror dock att det kanske är för lite. :o Får se senare idag.
[0:10:49] VintageLock: @Faeynna Not sure what you said but saw 2kg chocolate so it must be good LUL
[0:10:50] Berrasw3: @PapitoFred det är för övrigt bara vi coola som inte har den Kappa
[0:11:11] Faeynna: @VintageLock yea, gonna use it for baking for tomorrow. But it might be too little. :o Might have to buy more
[0:11:17] PapitoFred: @Berrasw3 Ah, jag förstår! Ni försöker visa att man kan parsea 100 utan yxan 8) Jävla galningar, hade gjort samma sak!
[0:11:38] VintageLock: @Faeynna Yes, always more ;)
[0:11:42] Berrasw3: @PapitoFred precis så! LUL
[0:12:03] Faeynna: @Berrasw3 eller hur! Riktiga gamers behöver inte yxan!

[0:28:37] StreamElements: https://starforgepc.com/Snowmixy
[0:28:59] Faeynna: It doesn't exist. :P
[0:29:06] PapitoFred: Only really the hardcore fans knows about it because they have never spoken about the lore. They uploaded tiny eastereggs everywhere and then "leaked" stuff on purpose x) and made a real sketchy website with tiny clues etc, its a whole whole thing
[0:29:13] PapitoFred: They only just now with this new song talked about it openly :)
[0:29:21] Faeynna: Is Julia gonna heal?
[0:29:23] PapitoFred: They posted video called "I am Clancy" which explains the lore
