[1:03:31] Macwall: reset on tuesday/wednesday
[1:03:31] pSovS: @JonnySweatpants ICANT
[1:03:32] mimic124: @BabaChaw you won't miss a raid lockout if leveling would take you more than 3 days
[1:03:33] CamGG__: @JonnySweatpants no but 1-25 will have increased xp rate
[1:03:33] shiggydoo43: you need like 48 hours marathon playing to catch first logout on monday anyway
[1:03:37] budmodeos: it sounds like they’re listening to the players, and for me that’s the win here.
[1:03:37] Macwall: first 2 resets
[1:03:40] Maqooz: @JonnySweatpants yes for only 20€
[1:03:42] BabaChaw: oh I see
[1:03:45] Maqooz: Kappa

[1:04:12] invisiblePenguin0: Now the race is who can get the most level 40 on the first lockout
[1:04:14] mlady_telegramz97: @safari3 well, its a lot like retail, but its almost a lot of custom spells and content in classic era, so its still classic omE
[1:04:14] Mr_Moffert: @Blufootgaming okay you changed my mind, im widepeepoHappy now

[1:04:52] mlady_telegramz97: do we level shaman or warrior first? @guzu
[1:04:54] Bishox: Its kind of best of both worlds
[1:04:54] Damnion: Should have just been the first week
[1:05:03] Bishox: Best solution
[1:05:03] ashtaroxx: SpeedL woah SpeedR

[1:22:15] Mr_Moffert: removing the main reason for buying gold, will def help
[1:22:16] Infrantic: People bought gold before GDKPs even existed
[1:22:16] mordiell: @bigwilly3737 probably not, since epics are coming into the talk now, lot of people will buy gold to buy them off the AH
[1:22:17] Spikeqc: CAUGHT

[1:22:29] Alakablam: yeah buy once for a mount not 3x a week to pay 5k an itme in gdkp LULW
[1:22:32] Petrichorx_x: yes but it removes a lot of the incentive to buy gold
[1:22:35] Hotform: should be way easier for blizz to track gold buying if there are no gdkp in the system
[1:22:35] ritter184: Other than epic mount, do you even need gold in SoD?
[1:22:36] hushbang: CAP .... Its a MAJOR reason Gold buyers exist

[1:24:46] mimic124: anything asmond says holds no value to me
[1:24:46] Arthident: imo they should'Ve stopped this whole gdkp and selling runs things years ago.. rn its too late sadly
[1:24:47] Seoken1: I think it will just evolve into full "carry runs" with set prices that are listed etc, it just changes I think @Guzu

[1:26:44] mlady_telegramz97: Guzu participated in GDKPs ✅ Guzu took bennies in Hardcore making it not very hardcore ✅ Guzu got mobtagged in HC tournamnet ✅ YEP Guzu is the worst Madge !!!!!!
[1:26:45] DamDamPew: can we talk about holy paladins still getting cucked tho
[1:26:45] Sittinbacknzone: gdkp alot of time drives personal responsibility and higher accountability vs guilds who are non confrontational to the low effort players
[1:26:49] KULPAcs: I like you @Guzu because of your integrity! keep on changin
[1:26:52] bronchoped1: Pendulum of doom shaman going to delete fools
[1:26:53] choppeddx: w
[1:26:53] flowerpew: @Trexbo_ YEP he condemned the tournament and then watched it RAGEY
[1:26:54] pvproteus: If the problem is indeed "GDKPs" that result in gold buying, surely aggressively banning gold buying would also have the effect of reducing the amount of GDKP runs without outright banning them no?
[1:26:56] xEinfachPoki: GDKPs are not the issue. Then you will have a lot of discord where ppl pay there items with PayPal. that makes it even worse. And it will happen @guzu
[1:26:56] ritter184: LFM PeacebloomDKP
[1:26:58] TBAGodzilla: GuzuDKP Weird

[1:27:07] Kinghorn: FirstTimeChatter 󠀀
[1:27:09] mordiell: NODDERS huge W but mages need more fire runes
[1:27:11] Damnion: They police bots and gold buyers, how do they plan to police raid groups doing GDKPs
[1:27:16] Damnion: they can't*
[1:27:16] somadaz: @xEinfachPoki incorrect
[1:27:17] mimic124: SURE

[1:27:24] johahs95: no way lmaooo
[1:27:24] imvecks: already happens

[1:27:27] Trexbo_: @flowerpew Hecking streamer man is a hypocrite!! RAGEY
[1:27:27] henrikbc98: Could happen
[1:27:28] Bayne_77: you honestly think that doesn't already happen ?
[1:27:28] nogladd: gdk just gonna move to discord
[1:27:28] smithers0351: idiot
[1:27:30] TBAGodzilla: ofc

[1:27:31] Jalapinot: LUL idiot comment
[1:27:32] vaizaad: how they know it work or not? by looking the forum?
[1:27:33] Alakablam: and then you get one rat in the discord and 90% of people wont take a risk
[1:27:33] lazurith: Inconvenience will always deter  people
[1:27:33] SlapdickWoWplayer: nobody buying Hydra with paypal lol
[1:27:35] xEinfachPoki: Yes 100% ppl that buy gold will also buy items with the money
[1:27:35] SippinSimpSyrup: Yeah they wont
[1:27:35] Coolwiththegang: Real Moni? KEKW
[1:27:36] Vertigo_GB: by far the minority

[1:27:38] 3Brick_: @mordiell Hot Streak Instant Pyro Rune Prayge
[1:27:38] snaildaddy: thats a healthier model than gold farming LUL
[1:27:39] tabondhimek: thats some private server mentality lol
[1:27:39] Goji_o7: @Guzu Black Market is alrdy setting up a barter system using materials
[1:27:39] ritter184: Idk, cuts out the gold middle man
[1:27:40] Wedgeh: FirstTimeChatter
[1:27:41] vivimaus: tha would not effect the normal players eco
[1:27:41] bl1nk_1298: @xEinfachPoki why do people like you not realize that even if something doesnt completely eliminate a problem, it is still worth doing? It will probably reduce GDKPs by at least 50%
[1:27:42] ClinxyWow: people sell SGC on whitemain for 20bucks
[1:27:43] CamGG__: deters the gold buyers
[1:27:43] diddlysquat: that's fine honestly because it wont inflate the gold in the game
[1:27:44] Bayne_77: gold selling sites already off that as a service
[1:27:44] mimic124: FirstTimeChatter
[1:27:48] vyoshi93: they just won't advertise it as "GDKPs" and have internal discord transactions
[1:27:49] Hotform: once gdkp isnt in game lfg chat spam it will heavily slow down
[1:27:50] Trexbo_: YEP
[1:27:50] Coffeeraptor: yes gdkps will move to discords but that already filters out a lot of people
[1:27:51] fake_based: Yea I am going to stop doing GDKPs now
[1:27:51] mlady_telegramz97: thats such a degen move
[1:27:51] lanlock1: FirstTimeChatter shitt
[1:27:51] tw1ZTER: @Guzu people who argues with you are gdkp involved
[1:27:51] Jalapinot: OMEGALUL GDKP "community"
[1:27:52] choppeddx: asmonSmash
[1:27:52] mcboonee: they can launder through auction house, alts etc
[1:27:53] Curtsy: Deterrence works chatter, that's literally the basis of rules
[1:27:54] mordiell: @3Brick_ AND 0 mana pls
[1:27:54] Nuhring: PaypalDKP Hype!
[1:27:54] marvinmc420: I wouldnt risk getting banned for it LUL
[1:27:55] Llyan74: the ppl it will defer are not the ones doing RMT though
[1:27:55] MonsieurTog: GDKP are cringe
[1:27:57] mcboonee: so they cant flag trades
[1:27:57] Maqooz: i will snitch!
[1:27:57] twitchforgotmyaccount: @Ciaaattt I'm 100% sure there will be "discord stuff" but the whole point is that it's going to be marginal when compared to what's currently going on.
[1:27:59] caypr: I think itll result in more guilds carrying one person for gold instead of GDKP
[1:28:02] clootz: $50 for that 4 stam 4 strength leather belt please
[1:28:03] SippinSimpSyrup: Good then they will get banned
[1:28:05] smithers0351: shitt
[1:28:10] Mr_Moffert: i would rather them remove 50% of gdkps than 0%
[1:28:10] KULPAcs: it will be a small circle
[1:28:13] Alakablam: as guzu said it'll deter most but the most hardcore gdkp players
[1:28:14] fake_based: @Guzu I used GDKP to make alot of gold Phase 1 this change will make me stop
[1:28:15] Blufootgaming: yeah my guilds probably just gonna keep it internal YEP
[1:28:16] mimic124: they can pay for them with paypall for all I care, as long as it doesn't inflate all the prices
[1:28:19] Ciaaattt: @Ciaaattt yeah, but discord gdkp is gonna be scary as fuck
[1:28:20] Sittinbacknzone: gdkp's had highest execution in wotlk on servers
[1:28:22] Kinghorn: CALL PREFOX HE IS CRYING
[1:28:23] chox_x: Man what am i gonna spend my dads money on now if i can't buy gold and items in GDKPs anymore? ExistentialCrisis
[1:28:28] sekcmexi99: might make it so you cant trade gold in raid or something
[1:28:30] TBAGodzilla: the chat is moving so fast when you're talking about GDKP LULW self reported
[1:28:30] smithers0351: no more streamer GDKP
[1:28:31] siggysudzz: so your telling me i cant swipe my card to afk in a raid and then sit in dalaran all day?
[1:28:31] somadaz: @Sittinbacknzone who cares
[1:28:32] b4ck13: good let him get banned
[1:28:36] JuggernautNukes: Even if this only prevents 50%, even 25% of the GDKPs that are going on its a HUGE W from Blizzard imho.  GDKPs are encouraging stuff like botting and goldbuying - let it rot somewhere.
[1:28:37] br0fest0r: Personally idc if ppl still do gdkps via discord, just keep it out of tradechat/worldchat/LookingForGroup-chat
[1:28:38] SippinSimpSyrup: Im going to seek them out so i can report all the people in them
[1:28:39] LeeshDK: seeing LFG channel filled with GDKP makes some people think they have to buy gold to get a group
[1:28:39] nemzky: Ahmpy is going to be in shambles loserr
[1:28:40] smithers0351: Misery wrath
[1:28:41] Kinghorn: GDKP ban in cata sakuRNG

[1:28:44] ashtaroxx: plink Clap
[1:28:44] PoxxiTV: yeah also streamers cant promote it cuz then they will get banned
[1:28:45] wisenot: its a smaller part of the problem, still worth solving
[1:28:49] snaildaddy: imagine if they removed gdkp from era
[1:28:51] harrisbueller: undercover gdkp police in disc
[1:28:52] mimic124: @Kinghorn prayy

[1:33:28] Rahmulous: I just wish they would make heroic leveling raid difficulty. since they’re doing long phases give us normal and heroic.
[1:33:28] smithers0351: peepoDyingFromToxicFumesReleasedFromASpraypaintCanBecauseHeWasNotWearingAMask

[1:34:24] Avviato: no, hard raid will make it WOTLK = dead game

[1:34:55] GeoZer_: Yep but it's not really leveling raid when a phase is 2 months, they can nerf it later

[1:34:59] bronchoped1: @guzu crowd pummeler is now a druid weapon

[1:35:01] newaccountx999: Leveling should take time, sure. But it shouldn't be hard to a point where tryharding is necessary
[1:35:02] Ciaaattt: can you check new runes for druid sajj

[1:35:04] StreamElements: Please keep chat in English. Messages will be deleted and you might get timed out.
[1:35:04] CALOT_ROGUE: Dude your Queen cut out is BIS lol
[1:35:07] tacodoc: Shuriken toss sounds a little weak but any aoe is something
[1:35:09] IlkoKvaygonn: I thought they would make Gnomeregan a 35 lvl raid to emphasize its "catch up" nature + Level 50 Scarlet feels a bit too far from the original dungeons. I guess 60 lvl Kharazan Crypths though.
[1:35:11] MrSchnack: https://www.twitch.tv/erobb221/clip/PlumpPoliteElephantBigBrother-VTKTDr0yNHqqNRcF?filter=clips&range=24hr&sort=time @Guzu RAGEY

[1:54:59] jimpansk0r: @Curtsy so? there are so many ways to avoid it. do the bidding in discord ... make everyone deposit a pot value and then the items get bid out in discord just as an example ... pretty much every good gdkps has more or less fixed grps with their own discords and good organisation
