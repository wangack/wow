[0:21:38] Reuoh: go do the overload public event and farm the chest for legendary shards, then you can turn the shards into glimmer and get more bounties and fragments for subclasses. Also for high stat armour when the weekly dungeon is pit of heresy you can farm the boss for it.

[0:34:22] austiinos: @shlinkymeister I have about 2k hours d1. 3k I'm d2. Pve is great. Pvp has been crap since bows were added and got worse with stasis. Pvp will only go downhill honestly. Not fun or worth for how abilities are in this game. Bungie also really likes sbmm in casual stuff with quitter penalties on crap maps. They also never make actual good maps for 3 years now.

[0:37:05] austiinos: @shlinkymeister ya that's why rn a lot of people compare to the taken king d1. No seasons and it was by itself a great expansion. Bungies road to seasons and it's season pass is all a blur for "new" cosmetics they dish out compared to the quality of what players actually get
[0:37:06] donoJay: you have 22k glimmer Shroud

[0:37:47] niveous_a: Nerdge super efficient for this 7 year old raid
[0:37:55] drbeamed: YouTube videos help you understand the game better shroud its worth it .
[0:37:58] Raiol_Varakin: ooh last wish, that will be good
[0:38:00] ZeIsior: oh they cheesin nvm

[0:38:35] Coronaxtraa: is he playing a warlock?
[0:38:38] chendeezy: @DJ_SnakeSss its a new fps from old battlefield devs. search for it on steam... looks insane
[0:38:39] austiinos: @shlinkymeister yes pve is at its best rn minus that some of the mods are just not working at all. The ones that don't work and bug are the weapon related ones. Die and they stop working

[0:38:58] UnequalWagzz: this is the most entertaining kinderguardian i've watched. So innocent lol
[0:38:59] Spicy_Lemur: @shroud dont forget to grab a sword, you can get a good one from gunsmith in the tower
[0:39:00] omegamantime: @ChaoticViperz_ those lost sectors tho PepeLaugh
[0:39:00] Prastal: @shroud your best chance is vex strike force in the incursion zone for exotics
[0:39:03] Rain101v: We should spin the wheel challenge
[0:39:07] ChaoticViperz_: Truuuuu

[0:39:11] Prastal: Or get enough light levels for lost sectors
[0:39:13] SaintFizz: You can wait till the Lost sector is for chest pieces and farm that till you get the Starfire
[0:39:16] pumpstation: D2 armor picker
[0:39:19] Ghostyl__: starfire is pretty important for the build but it can still be better than nothing without it
[0:39:21] DJ_SnakeSss: Ohh fr? @chendeezy  imma check it out

[0:39:39] Marrowalk: Lost Sector Exotics works in the way that it will prioritize dropping the chests he has never unlocked, so its deterministic

[0:39:58] Prastal: always go to crystal side
[0:39:59] austiinos: @shlinkymeister one bad pve thing they added was raid / dungeon rotators. Where that raid or dungeon for the week is farmable. Others are one and done. Sucks to farm for something when you may need to wait 4 weeks.
[0:40:10] Jkist7: They doing a raid
[0:40:11] Jkist7: ?
[0:40:12] MustD1e7: is this game good for solo playing?
