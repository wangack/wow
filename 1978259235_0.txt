[0:03:40] bogusny: Cdank and Italianguy are actual agents, I swear to God. I've seen them not only get themselves killed but also many others in groups and raids. Their positioning, squirrel brains, they just aren't cut to tank and heal. However, this can't all be blamed on them, Luna was also in the group and it's a positioning error by the group as a whole, but holy shit just be extra mindful. For those that don't know this is what 200 hours down the drain looks like. At this level it's a kick in the nuts

Their positioning, squirrel brains, they just aren't cut to tank and heal. However, this can't all be blamed on them, Luna was also in the group and it's a positioning error by the group as a whole, but holy shit just be extra mindful. For those that don't know this is what 200 hours down the drain looks like. At this level it's a kick in the nuts

[4:17:22] bogusny: Cdank and Italianguy are actual agents, I swear to God. I've seen them not only get themselves killed but also many others in groups and raids. Their positioning, squirrel brains, they just aren't cut to tank and heal. However, this can't all be blamed on them, Luna was also in the group and it's a positioning error by the group as a whole, but holy shit just be extra mindful. For those that don't know this is what 200 hours down the drain looks like. At this level it's a kick in the nuts

[6:21:23] bogusny: Cdank is an actual agent, I swear to God. I've seen him not only get himself killed but also many others in groups and raids. His positioning, his squirrel brain, just isn't cut out to be a tank. However, this can't all be blamed on him, as it's a positioning error by the group as a whole, but holy shit just be extra mindful. For those that don't know this is what 200 hours down the drain looks like. At this level it's a kick in the nuts and you just want to lay down and cry.
