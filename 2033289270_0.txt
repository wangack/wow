[0:18:17] ren0m: !macro
[0:18:22] ren0m: !macros
[0:19:01] ren0m: Would you please show me how your mouseover macro looks like
[0:19:19] ren0m: And it makes all spells mouseover?
[0:19:25] ren0m: I'll check it out

[0:20:44] Vitaraptor: Would love to see druid in mdi
[0:21:10] bearbro9: hey jb
[0:21:20] Vitaraptor: Is aug still a must?
[0:22:58] herpderpdoublederp: does aug means higher overall DPS every time?
[0:23:41] herpderpdoublederp: I was under the assumtion you were sacrificing a slight DPS loss for insane utility with aug
[0:27:01] Guffels: i really liked the pace. as an aotc pushing mythic player, i just hit 486 this week

[0:27:31] kondelol: except me PepeHands
[0:27:44] xDeceit: morning mr JB
[0:28:24] kondelol: balance?
[0:28:29] dragona92: The boomy
[0:28:48] Guffels: i really like that the difference between farmed gear from keys and vault is only 6. doesnt feel nearly as bad as last season
[0:29:14] Aggroboy: Mist has Revival for that lmao
[0:29:37] caradea_: i always hope that this dudes shield is up at the right time
[0:29:48] Guffels: would love to see how many people were in the shield
[0:31:09] StreamElements: restreaming live every day to https://www.youtube.com/@jdotb
[0:33:18] Aggroboy: meow
[0:33:52] kondelol: What do you think of using belor trinket on druid?
[0:36:10] Guffels: not at this key level but lower its good for dps
[0:37:57] Guffels: i wonder if there is a consistent way to desync those 2 mobs
[0:38:14] vilej1234: curse, he stood in shit
[0:38:21] caradea_: from the swirlies
[0:38:45] Perry_TP: OMEGALUL
[0:38:46] Aggroboy: i can relate LUL
[0:39:59] kondelol: RAGEY
[0:44:43] ren0m: Who'll clip it
[0:45:14] koala_715: getting back into Rdruid m+ for first time since BfA, any key tips?
[0:47:52] Guffels: dont waste gcds casting rejuv. farm clearcasting procs
[0:49:28] koala_715: Makes sense, thanks :D
[0:50:14] Kettos: In AoE scenarios do you cast rip withouth 5points? or its a waste of points?
[0:50:16] xDeceit: if you meld/vanish off the throw on oakheart as a DPS does it mess with the tank at all?
[0:51:38] Guffels: lol
[0:51:58] chiefwakka: medic!
[0:58:35] FrabjousDaze: it needed to fit the theme of the rest of the dungeon being awful Kappa
[0:59:14] dragona92: I am the squishy one :)
[0:59:39] dragona92: This dungeon in general needs some more tunning I feel like
[1:00:34] dragona92: Beginning of dungeon also feels overtuned
[1:01:45] Tweedleum1: I'm trying my hand at healing right now - disc priest - how do we handle bursting outside of Mass Dispel windows?
[1:01:55] RemwayTV: I hate that I feel like I need to bank my clearcasting procs to trigger the nourish during that which means regrowth needs to be prerolling which is fine but needing the swiftness prior which also sucks
[1:02:09] drdrozd12: @Tweedleum1 dispel yourself then ress the others
[1:02:24] dragona92: Timer for sure feels too tight, I agree
[1:04:52] RemwayTV: he had 3 defensives available too
[1:04:55] Guffels: he got hit by something right at the end?
[1:04:57] RemwayTV: like why no grp barrier from him
[1:05:17] Possitiviti: !talents
[1:05:28] RemwayTV: thats the barrier cast i think
[1:05:32] dragona92: Sounds like the ground swirlie
[1:05:44] drdrozd12: how did he die faster than the boomie, kinda impressive
[1:06:09] StreamElements: StinkyCheese Hate seeing ads? StinkyCheese Ads support streamers. Sub today for Pog ad-free viewing Pog and exclusive channel emotes. SeemsGood
[1:06:45] zashar_: Having it on yourself also make your hot tick faster so, it does more heal
[1:06:50] dragona92: Did u notice the embelishment with the vers can go on the trees too? KEKL
[1:07:22] FauniB: mage had personals open for sure, they should all be off cd there
[1:07:23] Guffels: kinda sus man never popped his alter or his 70% dr after procing caut
[1:07:57] drdrozd12: mage could for sure have lived if he had used defensives
[1:07:59] Guffels: tree form lol
[1:08:17] caradea_: more mastery
[1:08:30] Guffels: could you have sent more guardian stacks?
[1:08:31] dragona92: Tree form is useless 90% of the dungeon tho KEKW
[1:08:43] xDeceit: what happened i missed it
[1:08:59] drdrozd12: healing wouldnt have saved him, he would have needed a DR to live
[1:09:01] RemwayTV: I think reforestation is good there over budding leaves but idk - mage shuda used 1 of his 3 defensives
[1:09:01] Guffels: leaf over pips
[1:09:25] Guffels: mage could have just pressed his alter correctly tho or either dr
[1:09:28] dragona92: @RemwayTV Tihs tbh KEKW
[1:09:55] RemwayTV: @dragona92 ?
[1:10:27] dragona92: Mage uses one of his 3 defensives or not step on a swirlie - sounds like he lives dragon1599Shrug
[1:10:56] RemwayTV: @dragona92 he didnt step in swirlie, that was just an indicator that cast was going off on details - I think - there was no dmg from radiant
[1:11:16] RemwayTV: plus it does unavoidable aoe too while swirls go out
[1:11:19] dragona92: If so - fair, but then point still stands
[1:11:26] RemwayTV: agreed
[1:12:11] nellfin: just start with a +2 at that point
[1:12:22] Guffels: time to recover it
[1:12:55] xDeceit: does rageheart stay agi when you use it as resto? or does it flip to int
[1:13:13] xDeceit: ahhh makes sense
[1:13:14] Possitiviti: Which one is vessel?
[1:13:19] drdrozd12: from atal
[1:13:49] drdrozd12: fyrrak trinkets are all secondary stat
[1:14:26] Guffels: hasted 2rppm, i could believe it was decent
[1:14:32] Possitiviti: !tier
[1:14:56] drdrozd12: was using vessel on pally because some warlock traded it to me, was kinda like 5% -8% of my damage
[1:14:56] bulfoooz: yoo jdot :)
[1:15:42] chadworld77: not trolling, i like your stream, but i feel like i watch more of you looking for keys than actually running them lmao
[1:15:54] Guffels: so how excited are you to prog tindral pre nerf today?
[1:16:10] RemwayTV: Would you ever run blossom for throughput just so you could catweave more? dmg by proxy
[1:16:22] dragona92: @chadworld77 That's the negative side about not having a team and trying to pug high keys... It's how it is on EU
[1:17:03] Guffels: also blossom is kinda mid at best
[1:17:10] Smerts93: @dragona92 I can relate to that!
[1:17:22] dragona92: Same tbh
[1:17:36] drdrozd12: at that point just run a stat stick like sea star or blood i guess
[1:19:22] Lify: What if healing trinket saves lives ;p
[1:19:51] Vitaraptor: So is yur heart of the wild just to boost those basic dps gcd's or should i be pumpin more
[1:20:41] Lify: Comparing Blossom, which trinkets would you actually run that over dps ones?
[1:22:21] Possitiviti: is it better to cat with heart of the wild or moonkin and startfire?
[1:23:48] dragona92: Do u find it hard to use the Iridal? I feel like a lot of time I don't have the spare global to use it on an enemy
[1:24:11] Vitaraptor: So wats spell prio durin lust then.  Assumin 5+ targets
[1:26:11] RemwayTV: Ive seen a few people macroing it into equip mid m+ since u can change weps
[1:27:07] RemwayTV: its bis for us
[1:27:24] dragona92: I mean, I know it's not on the GCD, but I have my target being a friendly name often and I cannot obviously cast it then, so I was wondering if u got some other sneaky tips KEKW
[1:27:27] RemwayTV: not necessarily rdruid sorry using it with macro etc
[1:28:07] Possitiviti: Any tips how to maximize dmg during bl+heart window like is it better to moonking starfire or cat dmg if 5 or more target?
[1:28:26] RemwayTV: shift+lc for me
[1:28:28] RemwayTV: yeeee
[1:29:13] dragona92: I do have mouseovers mostly, it's just that it happens sometimes for some reason FeelsStrongMan
[1:30:30] dragona92: NOTED
[1:31:06] dotbotter: whats your logic behind your ui? placements of weakauras, plates etc
[1:31:43] xDeceit: if you meld/vanish off the throw on oakheart as a DPS does it mess with the tank at all? i misclicked my meld and got cussed out by a tank the other day
[1:31:44] yesterday_potato: my son lives in chat goes to utc
[1:31:46] Ionized4: no happiness allowed, only io gains
[1:31:53] dithrica: lolol, that's my attitude as a canadian living in Arkansas
[1:31:58] dithrica: Like nah i've had enough snow for a lifetime
[1:32:29] Nico_vdM: arrr kansas
[1:32:38] RemwayTV: i would laugh if he just never releases the tank
[1:32:45] Tortellini13: i think it just targets another dps
[1:32:49] Vitaraptor: Can u give yur basic lust + HotW spell prio for both ST and AoE
[1:33:13] RemwayTV: pips vers is nutty though for the dps
[1:33:16] Possitiviti: but doesnt it count that you do your full rotation without heals?
[1:33:23] Possitiviti: so when you do heals you lose the dps from pips
[1:33:33] dotbotter: make 2 gearset
[1:33:43] dotbotter: one trinket in each
[1:33:49] Nico_vdM: You have to make a seperate gearset for each trinket
[1:34:09] StreamElements: fresh youtube shorts going up 3x a week on https://www.youtube.com/@jdotb
[1:34:49] BiggTC: Is Tyrstone good for druid?
[1:34:56] RemwayTV: @BiggTC no
[1:35:08] xDeceit: int schmint
[1:35:12] xDeceit: go root
[1:35:28] Aggroboy: Tyr is pretty good for saving +20 pugs lol
[1:35:50] Possitiviti: doesnt it count you doing dps without heals? so then you would benefit fully from pips but in real life you cast heals also that take away from pips dps
[1:36:37] BiggTC: @aggroboy that's about what I'm in right now lol. Just leveling up, like 470ish
[1:38:37] RemwayTV: do it ezpz
[1:38:42] RemwayTV: this is the run
[1:38:51] Aggroboy: 29 rise sounds like hell
[1:39:17] RemwayTV: run it back then ;)
[1:39:36] Cervantas: the jump going up one key level feels really high this time around
[1:39:39] Nico_vdM: I think Blizz has to have a look at the timer for Rise
[1:39:40] dotbotter: do you think youd play wow if you werent a fulltime streamer?
[1:40:09] RemwayTV: I missed my rise timer at 3 levels higher because a bloody DH was afk typing/running across orbs and had to traverse back to res. was 20 secs over
[1:40:14] Cervantas: what would jb do if he wasn't a streamer?
[1:40:21] FrabjousDaze: KEKW
[1:40:21] markoleptic_: lmaoo
[1:42:35] dotbotter: why is that god bless?
[1:42:59] kuntoilija: KEKW
[1:43:02] FrabjousDaze: OMEGALUL
[1:43:10] markoleptic_: LOL
[1:43:20] Aggroboy: Jebaited
[1:43:49] kuntoilija: wtf is this mongol
[1:45:07] Nico_vdM: dispel?
[2:05:42] Morningstartt: jedithWave
[2:10:14] eainzsp: Thank you for fighting the fight that raiding has gotten way to sweaty
[2:10:26] Kemplore: I sold that trinket 2 weeks ago now everyone's using it
[2:11:17] Cervantas: at what level are you saying its hard?
[2:11:27] Cervantas: 20s are easier then ever and thats very above the average player
[2:11:29] treavorthenusance: wrath was peak wow and was the most accesible version but still had hardmodes as well for the sweats
[2:12:35] dragona92: @bliht WTB context, not on twitter
[2:13:07] Lify: Is there a bleed in BRH that you have to heal off?
[2:13:38] treavorthenusance: @Lify i dont think so but theres alot of debuffs that will stack and one shot people
[2:15:33] eainzsp: @dragona92 Essentially blizzard designed Tindral/Fyrak around Liquid/Echo so they could enjoy the tier, but has made a terrible experience for the majority of the playerbase.
[2:17:40] Possitiviti: !ui
[2:17:43] Possitiviti: !wa
[2:18:07] Possitiviti: damn anyone know what is the WA that shows the cooldowns of the mobs abilities on the right of him?
[2:18:17] eainzsp: @dragona92 Blizzard has attempted to nerf accordingly, but has missed the mark drastically, and this has been statistically a very slow progging tier because their philosophy going in
[2:20:25] dragona92: @bliht Agreed, but I don't think tunning passes are over monkaHmm
[2:21:39] eainzsp: @dragona92 Oh 100% I agree, but here's a snippet of what JB posted. "At week 9 of Amirdrassil, the number of Mythic Fyrakk kills was under 100. By this point in Aberrus, there were already over 300 kills of Sarkareth!"
[2:22:53] eainzsp: Statistically a very difficult tier, which creates frustrating player experiences.
[2:27:10] Gusserino: But if its over in 1 week i guess it will also lead to a lot of player frustration ?
[2:28:34] treavorthenusance: i think its more frustrating because its the second to last boss that is the road block. i think if fryakk was that hard it would be less frustrating
[2:29:39] LBNinja7: tank about to go non verbal
[2:31:17] kelly_mac06: @treavorthenusance yep, all my friends are 7/9 and just struggling for a few weeks on M Tindral
[2:31:24] kelly_mac06: which is a huge feelsbad
[2:31:34] kelly_mac06: one of the had a 600k wipe on m tindral
[2:31:40] kelly_mac06: like fucking HEARTbreaking
[2:32:48] LBNinja7: yo this tswift remix is insane
[2:33:18] LBNinja7: speaking of tindral
[2:39:09] toxikdh: when i ll see my yoinked fyrakk trinket in action so far only push druid keys
[2:42:34] Scopeeye: Scopeeye subscribed with Prime. 
[2:43:56] xDeceit: you can meld tech
[2:44:07] xDeceit: to become big before first volley
[2:44:24] cajovysacok: what is the cd on AMZ ?
[2:44:43] LazarP: u taunt and when he casts volley he melds and someone else taunts
[2:44:46] LazarP: and then he melds
[2:44:57] LazarP: the volley
[2:45:13] cajovysacok: but its risky  sometimes doesnt work
[2:45:26] anduzin: make sure to meld late into the cast
[2:45:31] treavorthenusance: yea taunt meld, then taunt meld
[2:45:55] anduzin: is you tank nelf?
[2:46:24] anduzin: the dps has to taunt before he casts volley, its very risky :d
[2:46:30] anduzin: if your tank has no meld
[2:48:06] Phatori: How do you utilize trees? Do you drop all 3 charges at once? or space them out
[2:49:21] sawako07: you can also drop them to cover a damage event
[2:49:28] sawako07: multiple ones
[2:50:11] sawako07: are u using crit flask for damage here?
[2:51:20] eainzsp: Is this your push team?
[2:51:33] cajovysacok: i saw whne it didnt happend it was noot good to watch
[2:51:36] sawako07: how much do you think crit gains dam over vers?
[2:51:40] Scopeeye: ever play with a cast tracker for stream?
[2:55:20] sacresacred: you mean the thing to the left?
[2:59:54] ToniderDon: what trink do u pref ?
[2:59:59] burne114: ive got a stat stick for u
[3:01:09] treavorthenusance: bale fire is nice for big heals
[3:03:04] OfficialShwoopies: @jdotb could you explain what the tech is with jumping off the edge with the Chronoburst debuff in Fall? Does it negate the damage?
[3:05:56] theBroHam: bro i didn't even realize I got a gift sub the other day. Ty!
[3:08:48] Carmhealz: yikes
[3:09:07] cajovysacok: wouldnt be better if oyu stay back and mage on boss  because your tankyer
[3:09:22] cajovysacok: i didnt say nothing
[3:09:28] TBouse: Existing dot
[3:09:56] Carmhealz: that sucks
[3:10:33] 神機百煉: dwarf druid!
[3:10:38] Carmhealz: i was only ranged in BRH yesterday it really sucked on that boss lol
[3:10:47] Carmhealz: i did not have astral shift nearly enough
[3:11:45] Carmhealz: tank ended up boping me once...and i had beam on me so it went to them for a second lol.
[3:11:53] burne114: Did someone say you had been experimenting with Invigorate? Is it still v bad?
[3:14:54] copetk: yo bro
[3:14:59] copetk: back to druid
[3:19:02] ShootyCant: At least you're doing M+ with people that had a worse time with tindral than you did
[3:21:01] copetk: lucky timing to soak eh
[3:21:24] addieux: !talents
[3:22:13] Jemba: the angle WutFace
[3:22:28] Zarentina: can they not jump on you there?
[3:23:28] copetk: i think its a black spot for mob
[3:23:34] copetk: blank
[3:24:29] freddusya: did u guys pull all 12 ?
[3:24:43] FlippinSasquatch: they did yeah

[3:28:22] cajovysacok: if you would have mor br LUL
[3:29:10] maenkins: how are you liking vessel? or is it the only damage trink you have?
[3:29:13] Camelbak21: How far down do you have the anchor on your plater? :p
[3:29:55] cajovysacok: arcane mage has better barier
[3:30:25] Peebo01: so many memes about nerfs team going around
[3:30:32] Peebo01: hard to believe that team could be done over that
[3:30:48] jdotb: !base
[3:30:48] StreamElements: /script SetCVar( "nameplateOtherAtBase", 2 )
[3:30:53] Camelbak21: Oh cool
[3:32:56] Sadbe: Sadbe subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 27 months! the streak continues
[3:33:30] DONGAMAN: very exciting!!!!!!!!
[3:33:57] Sadbe: phase 3 still needs to be progged
[3:34:13] eainzsp: cool dudes in that group
[3:34:30] FuruF: Call in sick
[3:35:13] kelly_mac06: how many 30's have you gotten?
[3:35:27] Camelbak21: Mythic raiding is prison
[3:35:44] Xevenna: It should have been nerfed a long tim eago.
[3:35:45] weezie_61: Dont Raid.
[3:36:20] meowphietm: I stopped raiding its been a vibe
[3:36:21] cajovysacok: i am not even raiding because other people geting gear and also i waste 3h try to kill 1 boss
[3:36:54] kelly_mac06: yea all my loot comes from keys and GV
[3:36:59] kelly_mac06: the struggle is real
[3:37:05] Guffels: its wild people still wanted to prog today
[3:37:23] kelly_mac06: it's hard to justify progging today
[3:37:33] kelly_mac06: like if yall were super close to a kill then yea do it but you're not
[3:37:34] Xevenna: A lot of people have quit this tier. A lot of guilds have died cause these last 2 bosses.
[3:37:37] kelly_mac06: it's lame
[3:37:37] tabxzer: kill tindral on wednsday
[3:37:38] meowphietm: @kelly_mac06 same :3
[3:37:38] tabxzer: easy
[3:37:57] kelly_mac06: @meowphietm  it's teaching me patience in ways that i didn't realize lmao
[3:37:59] Jarlan23: i only raid for loot and when i dont get loot from raid i dont wanna do it
[3:38:32] zashar_: Thats insane
[3:38:36] zashar_: XD
[3:38:39] iklff: Nothing you can do when this boss was designed for 2 guilds.
[3:38:42] xDeceit: have you seen the double meld tech for last boss blackrook?
[3:39:10] Xevenna: tell em sorry its a snow day here in the midwest and ya gotta go shovel haha
[3:39:25] Guffels: wait I missed this last raid day. Fun fact, Based on progstats, this raid has taken the same amount of time as the last 2, but all the hours are in the last 2 bosses
[3:39:39] Sadbe: practicing a thing thats not in doesnt make much sense
[3:39:59] FuruF: Just say one of your kids is pushing +30 keys :)
[3:40:00] tabxzer: mute urself and listen to music its what I do :)
[3:40:10] krimsonhooker: go nonverbal
[3:40:14] xHukk: I don't raid mythic with my guild.  Because its to try hard..  I hate the sweaty, grindy and non stop wiping.  My guild wants me to raid Mythic..  I just refuse, I raid heroic then focus on M+ after AOTC
[3:40:18] iklff: At the end of the day you don't have to raid. Mythic raiding hasn't been fun for a while. Just do keys, it's the content you wanna do.
[3:40:44] tabxzer: whats ur best pull?
[3:40:45] tabxzer: ah
[3:40:59] cajovysacok: let s be honest proging raid  in 4 month in this season   is big time kill
[3:41:01] Kooznik: why keep pushing the prog when its getting nerfed into the ground tomorrow?
[3:41:12] tabxzer: tindral will die on wednsday
[3:41:23] Cshtv: just be in a guild that kills it pre nerf problem solved
[3:41:29] Jarlan23: how many days a week do you raid? 3?
[3:41:30] Xevenna: Games are meant to be fun, otherwise why play?   On the other hand, challenges are good, but sometimes it gets excessive and I think this is the point where the last 2 are beyond excessive.
[3:42:15] xHukk: You're guildmates are watching your stream right now..  And they are deciding right now if to kick you out or not.  lol
[3:42:18] kelly_mac06: yea they are supposed to be a challenge but not a WALL
[3:42:23] muonz: we are a giga tryhard guild and we cancelled first raid in a long time today. no point pulling tindral if it gets decimated on reset.
[3:42:41] mxgxbx: i feel the same on tindral as hpal
[3:42:48] muonz: @xHukk im pretty sure they know what jb is about and don't mind already.
[3:43:10] muonz: also he hasnt even said anything bad lol
[3:43:12] Sadbe: but double soaking is fun
[3:43:51] coba774: i like the fight but im rdps so its not like i have any responsibilities anyway
[3:45:01] Sadbe: argh might have to cancel our raid too. main tank posted hes stuck at the police station
[3:45:37] xHukk: I was being factious though..  lol  I'm sure they know how you feel.
[3:45:49] Xevenna: I'm sure the same sentiment is shared between many people in the raid anyhow.
[3:46:49] iklff: Do you think these nerfs are enough?
[3:47:27] lokimelkor: yo chat, what did I miss, JB looked annoyed for something raid related?
[3:47:39] StreamElements: fresh youtube shorts going up 3x a week on https://www.youtube.com/@jdotb
[3:48:35] Xevenna: @lokimelkor he had to leave a good group for raid to practice a nerf that isnt in yet.  No point in raiding when boss is getting nerfed on reset.
[3:48:54] lokimelkor: ohh. that is understandable
[3:56:06] ShwoogityWoogity: did he just say
[3:56:07] ShwoogityWoogity: US beer
[3:56:08] Sadbe: jb is throwing gasoline on fire
[3:56:09] Gusserino: LIES
[3:56:13] ShwoogityWoogity: is better

[4:12:18] kondelol: this looks fun :)
[4:13:16] scilencedh: Didn't they reduce damage of some things too?
[4:13:19] DONGAMAN: one shot next week :)
[4:15:00] scilencedh: Ah, just seeds it seems. Yeah, definitely still a rough fight after nerfs if you're not making it past p1.
[4:15:10] Guffels: boy every wipe after the nerf is gunna tilt people bad
[4:16:20] Pitonator: hello :), is there a reason why you're not raiding with your druid ?
[4:18:34] robfish06169: Do you primarily m+ heal?
[4:18:45] Pitonator: I see, thanks for the answer
[4:19:17] stormz_wow: not waiting for reset before prog?
[4:19:57] eb_farnum: I mean, prectice makes perfect
[4:21:16] stormz_wow: spacial paradox where
[4:21:20] sandman1244: Just consistent fire
[4:27:07] Fortearmure: why raid , wait for nerfs.
[4:37:47] davidart2: Howdy!! Daddy how is Tindra Prog going jdotbHmm
[4:40:43] puremike78: paralysis by analysis
[4:41:58] Opusdeity: is this just for the nerfs next week or?
[4:42:18] davidart2: Discussion = Better than pulls
[4:43:03] Opusdeity: literally doesnt matter, cant even test new strat?
[4:44:14] Opusdeity: lmao no it doesnt save any time
[4:45:10] worthtv: i got baited
[4:45:12] worthtv: i thought it was m+
[4:45:14] davidart2: You guys should save for next week 1 full week worth of Tyndral

[4:57:30] kondelol: RAGEY
[5:03:13] zerahaha: tswift doesnt play man
[5:03:29] zerahaha: anyone know what their best pull was before nerfs?
[5:05:58] SevzyYEP: You gotta get a huge scream over those comms, tell these people to pull
[5:06:25] Guffels: @zerahaha 42%
[5:09:55] davidart2: I can only think Fyrakk prog lmao
[5:10:41] sgtshellshocka: why are you guys banging your heads against a wall with the nerfs announced?
[5:11:59] SevzyYEP: I haven't been keeping up with WoW at all, are the nerfs just numbers tuning or is it timers or both?
[5:12:10] Arkarku: @SevzyYEP he's getting taken out back behind the shed
[5:12:27] SevzyYEP: Seems deserved tbh
[5:12:35] sgtshellshocka: it's an FPS tuning lmao. the double fire beam in p1 is getting removed. thus making 56 seconds in lag free
[5:12:49] sgtshellshocka: and also double soak seeds is not a wipe anymore
[5:12:51] SevzyYEP: 234 have killed it and 117 of those (50%) have already gone 9/9
[5:12:55] sgtshellshocka: so more guilds will get to p3 and kil it
[5:13:57] cyberkittyhana: looking happy today
[5:15:11] zerahaha: poor jb
[5:15:36] Sadbe: can we jump off the egde
[5:18:06] davidart2: why are people getting killed is flat damage or mechanics
[5:23:23] flawlesslykun: @davidart2 i can answer that question. blizzard thinks every1 is a world 1st raider, so they make bosses with the intent of having 20 ppl play like gods for 9 mins straight sometimes, that pretty much sums it up :)
[5:23:56] flawlesslykun: oh and it takes them like 4 months to realise this and then nerf it to the point even blind ppl can kill the boss :)
[5:26:01] Klutch81: rwf kills it for the 99.99999% of players
[5:27:21] Piaggio: dont do it jb, the boss isnt that bad Sadge
[5:28:28] flawlesslykun: i saw jmy reclear this with method this week, and believe it or not, even the ppl that take the drakes and fetch the orbs, cuck eachother and wipe the raid KEKW
[5:28:34] flawlesslykun: shit is unbelievably hard
[5:29:58] Piaggio: a few people i key with have stopped proggin this week waiting for nerfs LUL

[6:31:51] face2face: I can go look at what it does overall in keys

[6:33:30] dadgamer_o7: i tried it in a 27 brh on disc and It did 10% of my dps i did 92k overall
[6:33:37] dadgamer_o7: not sure if its different for rdruid
[6:34:18] dadgamer_o7: doesn't it only proc off ranged actions?
[6:35:31] Phatori: am i suppose to thrash or swipe while in cat?
[6:36:12] Phatori: awesome ty
[6:36:59] flawlesslykun: i hate this invis skip
[6:41:26] flawlesslykun: and this is exactly why i hate it. ppl still pull this trash anyway. not worth to lose a combat potion over it idk
[6:45:37] face2face: I hate pugs that dont bring these 2 down the stairs
[6:45:42] face2face: And then yell at me
[6:45:51] face2face: When I spen 4s straight trying to cast on some out of los fuck

[6:52:31] Disgrountled: *only
[6:54:52] flawlesslykun: YEP unforgiving timer
[6:57:05] flawlesslykun: pretty sure they designed this boss to show off the ping system btw KEKW
[6:57:34] face2face: @jdotb my 489 does around 4.8-5.2k dps overall on disc priest. So that's probably worth a bit more damage than pips in a hard key, but then is it worth dropping 5% healing for really less than 1% DPS?
[6:58:39] itzcamnar: what addon is that
[6:58:47] face2face: No, t he int
[6:58:49] face2face: The int is
[6:59:15] face2face: I'm not comparing static int to static vers
[6:59:23] face2face: The static vers is "competing" with the pips effect already
[6:59:32] face2face: The int is competing with the oakheart trinket proc
[6:59:38] face2face: So its just 5% int vs no healing gain at all
[7:00:03] Disgrountled: noticed late ?

[7:01:08] Disgrountled: I always run

[7:01:43] sullym22: hahaha
[7:01:53] sullym22: it happens man
[7:01:54] flawlesslykun: boomie left its joever

[7:03:50] Disgrountled: that`s why we here, to have fun with you :)
[7:04:31] flawlesslykun: because ppl don't press defensives on the 2nd one, they all send it on the 1st one when u have cds up FeelsOkayMan

[7:08:38] flandre77: played with treeform druid today this key he had no issue here
[7:08:49] sullym22: seems overtuned. even for a 28
[7:09:05] xjacobtv: Yeah definitely an incarn dungeon but the damage is pretty stupid
