[3:47:00] suraxis: my cat is neurotic
[3:47:06] Tenriism: It's irrational  anxiety or obsession with something.
[3:47:07] Renfuryy: individuals with high scores for neuroticism are more likely than average to be moody and to experience such feelings as anxiety, worry, fear, anger, frustration, envy, jealousy, pessimism, guilt, depressed mood, and loneliness
[3:47:18] Renfuryy: Such people are thought to respond worse to stressors and are more likely to interpret ordinary situations, such as minor frustrations, as appearing hopelessly difficult
