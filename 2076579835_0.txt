[1:37:10] jakeo92: His health went up to 13 mil from 700k on xaryus kill attempt

[1:37:27] N_Tys: needs to be at altar

[1:38:04] N_Tys: just boss
[1:38:05] carlos_the_7th: turning in blood does dmg to boss?
[1:38:17] ben_mdlol: why in your mind do you think its possible to do 20% in 3 mins when u took 20 mins to do 50%?
[1:38:19] ardice1: oh shit he has 255 blood

[1:39:41] ardice1: blood
[1:39:43] Lionkingler1: you just cant kill him
[1:39:46] ballsofruenkiller: @belleteteftw GM literally tanked it to altar and it didnt work
[1:39:52] AxelFromAustralia: check Agrands twitter cover image, he’s at the ruins near the beach, I bet you have to take boss there
[1:40:03] TheFamilyHorde: SS got a new house?
[1:40:04] limburgse: @ardice1 255 is the cap on icon, he has WAY MORE when you mouse over icon, Xaryu boss earlier had 1600+ ears
[1:40:05] mefiwow: what happens if you kill it?
[1:40:07] ballsofruenkiller: if u think none turned in bloods near an altar by accident ur nutty
[1:40:08] TheFamilyHorde: Grats bro
[1:40:12] siilver40: Have anyone manage to kill the blood boss?
[1:40:17] weedyy22: stop chat he needs content he needs to ignore u
[1:40:24] belleteteftw: @ballsofruenkiller THEY did not turn blood in
[1:40:27] andypandynz: i feel like this wasnt meant to be a thing but theyve quickly made it something with hotfixing cause of allthe eyes on it lol
[1:40:36] Brenno_Mc: you should try and repair at Nessingway - to see if it's possible
[1:40:37] Lionkingler1: hover over the buff for actual value
[1:40:44] N_Tys: yes on top
[1:40:49] biki2112: Try triangle theory!
[1:40:53] Valencia_Pete: if its a bring him to an altar thing i think its meant for 60 content and you bring him to zg and kill him as an offering to the blood loa or maybe next phase and something to do with ST
[1:40:58] ballsofruenkiller: @belleteteftw like i said if u think that many people went to altar and not 1 didnt turn in blood ur crazy
[1:40:58] Djbeerguy723: He must have a mechanic were he can't below 20%
[1:40:59] kb_h: i think you have to clear his stacks before bringing him pat 20%
[1:41:00] taliwoush: @Brenno_Mc you can
[1:41:00] limburgse: mouse over the debuff for actual ear count
[1:41:00] gh00775: EU JUST DOWNED HIM!!
[1:41:02] maddie_1994: Bring him to Stormwind
[1:41:07] MechanicalMelee: you have to bring in in arena
[1:41:19] chancerofl: @gh00775 PROOF???
[1:41:24] belleteteftw: @gh00775 do you have a link?
[1:41:25] aspectoflion: spirit res

[1:41:34] snigglewhippin: damn so close
[1:41:36] 0msa: ijts joever
[1:41:40] aspectoflion: blizzard is going to buff his health after today
[1:41:42] maddie_1994: Without that health buff you would have had him :(
[1:41:45] safkae: mathematically impossible
[1:41:48] itsae__: U have to shit your pants at that part if I remember correctly
[1:41:48] fragmonkey71: Poor Judd is dead, poor Judd
[1:41:49] chancerofl: @ben_mdlol no they didnt lol
[1:41:49] Lionkingler1: Sadge another NA L
[1:41:51] baakadii: Maybe there is a special alter you take him to turn in his "stacks"
[1:41:51] Sysdemes: he gets so much hp at 20%
[1:41:58] Coked_up_Penguin: die less
[1:41:58] cook_pc: accept that it cant die
[1:42:00] famousivan: last group was at 13% was at the arena
[1:42:02] Vallun: probably not die as much
[1:42:02] oakenempire: drag him to zg lol
[1:42:03] Frostlicious: idk he has a phase 2
[1:42:05] maddie_1994: That seems impossible to do in that time limit, unless there's a way to deal with his massive health pool
[1:42:06] jiggalake: u gotta use the big iron fishing pole
[1:42:08] Timzn91: ^more hunters
[1:42:09] QuestFor420: might have to take his stacks off
[1:42:11] Corndogman: How much hp did he get?
[1:42:13] plumpus81: did you see his total HP?
[1:42:14] kb_h: buff based on blood maybe
[1:42:15] Vallun: some kiting strategy may be required to minimize the ears he gains
[1:42:16] QuestFor420: before 20%
[1:42:17] AxelFromAustralia: agrands twitter cover photo is the hint… look at his twitter page cover photo
[1:42:19] Fachura: need to inform everybody in bulletin board
[1:42:20] grizz430: is it possible that the rumoes were wrong and Blizzard actually won't let him die?
[1:42:22] DrCuddly: He gets 13 million at 20%
[1:42:22] Sowiloo: can you move him to stormwind
[1:42:23] jordano111: shaman debuff his hp buff gg
[1:42:24] SCjake23: they got him to 13 yea just needed more time i think not sure
[1:42:25] GeneralBurns1: its confirmed you need to click the alters in order... jk just my thoughts
[1:42:25] andypandynz: so ur saying hes not meant to be killed?
[1:42:29] GreenLizzardx: Some one should use detect magic
[1:42:31] Slaanesh74: is there some tainted blood thing?
[1:42:31] TheFamilyHorde: Maybe there's a blood disease somewhere he needs to catch?
[1:42:32] N_Tys: altar at 20% 100%
[1:42:32] stork_leg: form raid group maybe?
[1:42:32] limburgse: @Corndogman 14 mil at 20%, he has 3.2mil at start
[1:42:32] PawgersHC: Maybe take him to a different alter than where he spawned at
[1:42:34] cook_pc: you need 500 warriors to press execute
[1:42:35] Lionkingler1: not have people grief like crazy
[1:42:35] ben_mdlol: EU have done it
[1:42:37] aspectoflion: it’s like 18 million hp at 20%
[1:42:37] siilver40: Can you kite him to the horde village and get help by the guards to kill him faster @StaysafeTV ?
[1:42:39] baakadii: I bet theres some special alter you take him to that turn in his stacks
[1:42:40] snigglewhippin: all the blood stacks on players give him extra health at that point you dont want blood so he has less hp! ding dong!
[1:42:40] maddie_1994: Time to pull out the triangle theory again
[1:42:46] GreenLizzardx: To see if he get some kinda hidden buff
[1:42:50] purevala33: BRING IT TO GURU ARENA!!!
[1:42:52] Synmachus: Aggrend FeelsWeirdMan
[1:43:01] Ervill1: 0/10 detectives
[1:43:01] andypandynz: health buff at 20% is because they need another 3 hours to add something cool to loot table
[1:43:02] WillowJane: theyve hidden hints in promo pieces for retail for months now, could be
[1:43:05] belleteteftw: @siilver40 pRoof?
[1:43:07] durham10: They had a GM pop up and tank  the boss earlier
[1:43:13] Xottz: could still be a hint but its giga tin foil hat conspiracy
[1:43:13] ThoR294: KEKW
[1:43:19] pursuit644: p2 dead
[1:43:22] endraga1: SCHIZO triangle theory
[1:43:27] MechanicalMelee: try the arena next time?
[1:43:29] ballsofruenkiller: ZG island??? kinda makes sense
[1:43:30] Slaanesh74: he needs blood poisoning
[1:43:31] limburgse: @siilver40 all guards in cities are hostile during the event, they will attack you instead of boss
[1:43:31] Shredmuffn: MAYBE YALL JUST SUCK KEKW
[1:43:31] SuperLost89: where is the tablet thing that has the text about killing him together?
[1:43:34] WillowJane: not enough arms warriors FeelsWeirdMan
[1:43:35] Genghish: Apparently there is a spot in STV where there s a tablet that says you have to cooperate to kill the blood god

[1:43:52] Frank4LuLz: 777777
[1:43:53] maddie_1994: Everyone just needs to do 1000% more DPS
[1:43:54] Frank4LuLz: 77777
[1:43:55] maddie_1994: Easy
[1:43:55] Xottz: what server?
[1:43:56] N_Tys: the last team got him to 13% by bringing boss to altar at 20%
[1:43:57] siilver40: @belleteteftw what do you mean by proof? i asked SF if he could if that would help

[1:44:05] Frank4LuLz: 7777
[1:44:08] MrWafer29: blue item on that mob
[1:44:08] Shredmuffn: you need repair bots
[1:44:10] belleteteftw: @siilver40 Wrong reply
[1:44:11] tylerheyd: have you asked warlock bob?
[1:44:15] PawgersHC: Maybe take him to a different alter than where he spawns
[1:44:18] Frostlicious: Dont think thats true
[1:44:21] mundanesickle: Thats not what happened
[1:44:21] EbbnflowDNT: honestly just need more bodies and more dps
[1:44:21] realandtruephobe: yeah but this morning we had more ppl for sure
[1:44:21] durham10: his health didn't change from that though
[1:44:24] ThePharmG: last group just dot rot to 13%
[1:44:30] plae007: @N_Tys if you're talking about w/ Xar the altar did nothing
[1:44:30] durham10: they just had a lot of people DPSing
[1:44:31] DrCuddly: % is relative, 13% might as well be 80% compared to where his initial HP begins
[1:44:32] ThePharmG: altar bad news just gotta burn baby burn
[1:44:33] throssome: if no blood = self heal then cashing in blood isn't the move
[1:44:33] siilver40: @belleteteftw ah alrighty
[1:44:35] realandtruephobe: it also still wasnt possible to DPS the 70m down
[1:44:36] jordano111: spam the spit emote
[1:44:38] mundanesickle: We simply did that much raw dps
[1:44:38] limburgse: that does nothing
[1:44:41] guidogang: the other group that got to 13% had 9 40 man groups pumping, they just took him down that far
[1:44:42] Sourr09: earlier there was like 500 people though...
[1:44:42] ballsofruenkiller: What if its like the boss in AQ where u have to have so much frost damage on the boss at a time.. what if 20 percent u gotta use so much poison ability to poison his blood?? @StaysafeTV
[1:44:47] limburgse: bringing him to altar does nothing
[1:44:47] Sysdemes: take him to the ZG rep island altar
[1:44:48] fans30: and a gm
[1:44:49] cloudstrife543: wtf is blood boss
[1:44:49] Etny2k: it wasnt 13% it was 13M out of 67M
[1:44:52] realandtruephobe: That's exactly right. i was there
[1:44:52] Frostlicious: they had all streamers there
[1:44:53] inflictawarlock: They also had 6 streamers in discord
[1:44:53] Etny2k: 20%
[1:44:54] famousivan: btw you can repair up north by the camp and I did it.
[1:44:56] belleteteftw: Any proof on EU killing it?
[1:45:01] Mister_Painter: definitely
[1:45:01] swidey221: boss might heal when there’s no blood above 20%, but at 20% he is blood full / blood frenzied and need to clear blood to kill. he didn’t heal after
[1:45:01] ThePharmG: they did dot rot down to14%
[1:45:02] gh00775: that’s what it was
[1:45:03] famousivan: GM was there with them as well
[1:45:04] HrdScp: I havent seen below 18%
[1:45:09] NotTheWheel: yeah cuz his hp started going back up after awhile
[1:45:10] gh00775: wayyyy more people
[1:45:12] durham10: they did have more people and a GM helped
[1:45:14] N_Tys: The GM did drag boss to altar but yeah who knows
[1:45:17] limburgse: @belleteteftw ofc not, its Kappa
[1:45:21] mundanesickle: @Etny2k No we got it to 14%
[1:45:27] realandtruephobe: we still can't DPS down 70m health in that little time
[1:45:33] Mister_Painter: idek if there's a mechanic or just dps check at 20%
[1:45:41] BadGerbilLion: I remember seeing high level stealth NPCs out in STV during the event. Any chance they could help kill him post-20%?
[1:45:43] taliwoush: Theres a tablet in STV that mentions the blood lord
[1:45:45] Toolt: boss was at 255 stacks, and so many people server crashed
[1:45:50] N_Tys: thats an insane dps check if true
[1:45:51] mattbarz989: did he hp boost?
[1:45:56] ballsofruenkiller: GM couldve fed into the mass majority of what they thought. Instead off just giving the answer.
[1:45:56] SuperLost89: @StaysafeTV there is a tablet somewhere that talks about cooperating to kill the blood god. maybe there?
[1:46:03] belleteteftw: what does the boss keep saying? May be a clue
[1:46:13] baakadii: I bet theres a special alter you take him to that turns in his stacks
[1:46:14] Slaanesh74: you need some ticks
[1:46:15] limburgse: earlier today boss had 1600+ ears
[1:46:19] ballsofruenkiller: @belleteteftw not a bad idea
[1:46:20] inspiredtv: zg island
[1:46:21] saund: He has to be completely underwater to rinse off his blood at 20
[1:46:26] dinkleminkle: what about deez nuts
[1:46:38] Slaanesh74: maybe some vampire bats
[1:46:39] Frostlicious: what if we /pray at it in phase 2
[1:46:39] SuperLost89: yes
[1:46:40] ardice1: yes
[1:46:43] inspiredtv: yes
[1:46:46] zakkoncrak: lol hakkar is the blood god
[1:46:46] limburgse: on ZG island there is a tablet with the lore about this guy
[1:46:47] Mister_Painter: does anyone know what he says in demonic?
[1:46:47] Noilane: kite the boss to gargalon
[1:46:49] merksman: yesss
[1:46:50] Seoken1: well let go
[1:46:53] inspiredtv: yes thats what im saying
[1:46:53] lickmypetals: hakkar is the blood god
[1:46:56] 0_exclamation: he swim animations for a reason
[1:46:56] lickmypetals: that table is from classic
[1:46:56] biki2112: Thats has been there for 20 years
[1:46:57] endraga1: hakkar is the blood god dumbass chat
[1:46:59] noshot_bucko: Peggers
[1:47:04] Brewsy_: NPCs could help you kill the loa
[1:47:09] mundanesickle: True, the altar was in phase 2 promo
[1:47:12] InsertYourseIf: where is ZG island?
[1:47:13] gh00775: @staysafetv the lore has to do with Hakkar. Hes appeasing Hakkar is how he gets his power
[1:47:15] CommonTeal: pepeSmoke
[1:47:16] WhudaFxUp: Well, you do go to an altar on ZG isle to pop Bijous, after killing.. You guessed it. Hakkar the blood god.
[1:47:17] Fachura: @StaysafeTV can you show that tank trinket you used ?
[1:47:23] noshot_bucko: pepeSmoke
[1:47:29] realandtruephobe: Blizzard wouldn't make the mechanic kite it to NPCs
[1:47:33] SuperLost89: KITE PATCHES TO THE BLOOD GOD
[1:47:37] saund: He has to be completely underwater to rinse off his blood at 20
[1:47:38] lickmypetals: Blizzard is fuckin stupid
[1:47:39] SilkeySmooth: your about to find out they had gm help
[1:47:40] Sysdemes: he does have a swim animation
[1:47:45] limburgse: @Brewsy_  you know how the event works? cityguards are hostile or asleep during event
[1:47:46] endraga1: hakkar is the blood god
[1:47:46] Evilindeed: yomama isle
[1:47:46] Frostlicious: yea it cant be a kite
[1:47:55] InsertYourseIf: mhm good idea
[1:47:55] Zaziben: that only makes sense if you are meant to kill him
[1:48:04] mintypete: bring him to darkshire
[1:48:06] Frostlicious: Maybe all /pray?
[1:48:07] 2drunk4this: sir... blizzard made the game you must play like they designed
[1:48:09] itsae__: Evilmorse monkaS
[1:48:12] mundanesickle: Its not supposed to be easy or even easily discovered
[1:48:14] taliwoush: You cannot kite him out of STV, we tried to take him to SW
[1:48:15] Seoken1: @mintypete he despawns when you do that, been tried
[1:48:15] PawgersHC: Take him to a different alter than where he spawns
[1:48:16] snigglewhippin: just think all the murlocs and raptors he will kill for you on the way! weeee
[1:48:17] biki2112: You tried killing hakkar instead?
[1:48:19] seukas: @StaysafeTV most plausable theory is having blood stacks on you gives you a shield like effect that reduces the healing
[1:48:20] HrdScp: can one of the giants near booty bay kill him maybe
[1:48:23] andypandynz: if this is supposed to be a thing why did they wait this long to nerf his hp to get ppl to try?
[1:48:23] Slaanesh74: get him an STD
[1:48:27] grizz430: he despawns if you take him out of STV
[1:48:28] AchillezHeals: he despawns if u try to kite outside the zone
[1:48:31] Seoken1: they already tried to bring him to duskwood, he warped back
[1:48:32] MezeiPoloska: isnt it just a 30minute race to kill him, and nothing more?
[1:48:32] englishurza: DISCOVER how to kill him....
[1:48:33] siilver40: What about drag him in to the STV arena, have anyone tried that?
[1:48:40] Seoken1: @siilver40 yes
[1:48:45] Roxannamyu: Did you learn what the bruised debuff does?
[1:48:47] taliwoush: @siilver40 We have, did nothing
[1:48:48] AceKush8807: @staysafetv  what if you have to kite him outside of stv ?
[1:48:49] SuperLost89: @StaysafeTV maybe reading the tablet triggers something? like, after reading it can you do something else to get a buff?  idk
[1:48:53] gh00775: @staysafetv the lore has to do with Hakkar. He gets his power from appeasing Hakkar.
[1:48:55] taliwoush: @AceKush8807 He will reset. We tried
[1:48:56] siilver40: @taliwoush okey
[1:49:01] AceKush8807: Damn
[1:49:02] KKonaStevieG: maybe if we make him watch brendan schaubs gringo papi that will kill him? KEKW
[1:49:03] PawgersHC: warriors all need mortal strike
[1:49:13] endraga1: SCHIZO Theorycrafting
[1:49:18] WhudaFxUp: The blood god is Hakkar, btw. Not KhaDamu
[1:49:19] Twitchful_Duelist: kite him to teremus the devourer in blasted lands
[1:49:26] nightbot_v19: why I feel drop Reins of the Bengal Tiger.
[1:49:30] gamewatcher024: This gaming scenario looks super fun
[1:49:32] nightbot_v19: There are two of them in wowhead
[1:49:33] Seoken1: so my theory is no matter what you need to out DPS the AoE heal, and its based on the number of players in 45yds. So you'd have like 4 raids all cycling 2-4 minute cooldowns, only 1 raid in at a time
[1:49:33] WhudaFxUp: Which is what the tabley is most likely referring to Hakkar.
[1:49:41] ObieTV: NEW ROOM WOOT
[1:49:43] katiekat792: Nessingwary
[1:49:47] ClinxyWow: thral

[1:49:51] freelootenthousiast: gigachad nessingwary
[1:49:52] stork_leg: maybe grom gol?
[1:50:01] stork_leg: guards might be hostile to you but they might also hit him as well
[1:50:03] mundanesickle: @Seoken1 He barely heals if you have blood
[1:50:06] Mawshaw: Someone tweeted it so it MUST be true Peggers
[1:50:06] nerfedxd: isnt the tablet at yojamba just lore to kill hakkar the blood god
[1:50:09] Mister_Painter: correcet
[1:50:14] 69backwards: @StaysafeTV what are your thoughts on meek mill spreading those cakes for P diddy?
[1:50:15] Tooshkit: yes
[1:50:17] WhudaFxUp: @nerfedxd Thats what ive been saying
[1:50:23] Etny2k: corrtect
[1:50:35] WhudaFxUp: Yojamba = ZG = Hakkar
[1:50:35] noshot_bucko: Peggers
[1:50:35] ballsofruenkiller: what if u need max blood stacks and maybe that does something to the boss?
[1:50:39] InsertYourseIf: Gayge Clap

[1:51:50] WhudaFxUp: Kha Damu, is just a thug.
[1:51:53] EbbnflowDNT: blood for the blood god?
[1:51:54] xyth_alispera: Diddy and will smith would have made a better couple than Jayda willie needs to come out the closet

[1:52:32] DarkEvilDIE: Skulls for the skull throne
[1:52:34] itsallabouTRIP: altar of the ZaZa
[1:52:34] mundanesickle: That altar was in promo so kiting the boss to this altar may make sense
[1:52:35] andypandynz: blizz are doing rehashed dungeons and wpvp each phase and u guys expect some elaborate mystery for a fel reaver npc? LUL
[1:52:36] poggersshaman: bababooey

[1:53:13] Slaanesh74: Jebaited
[1:53:14] taliwoush: maybe a buff?
[1:53:17] grizz430: maybe you need the blood god to defeat the Loa then
[1:53:17] Krabue: it may give buff for us
[1:53:19] GlitteryBeard: Hey there is a retail questline that has you killing a loa
[1:53:20] Sharksleep: this event was 20 years in the making Pog
[1:53:23] WhudaFxUp: Maybe we need to summon Hakkar. We need to farm Bijous
[1:53:26] ATcaribou: @StaysafeTV are there any triangles in STV?
[1:53:28] Ervill1: /kneel Kappa
[1:53:29] stefanblagojevic: If i remember its alliance quest for 4 tablets (quest items)
[1:53:30] HotFlatDietPepsi: What if the original dev teams plan was this event, and that tablet was always supposed to be the secret Kappa
[1:53:30] CygnusC: /pray
[1:53:30] taliwoush: During the event is active
[1:53:32] WhudaFxUp: You need Bijous
[1:53:32] M000gul: I think its not killable
[1:53:32] stankypanky22: Maybe the boss just isn't meant to be killed like the devs said :)
[1:53:36] ChillyHTX: and kneel with 2 flowers in ur bag
[1:53:37] Etny2k: /pray
[1:53:41] Dubokobud: discovering...
[1:53:44] katiekat792: It’s about Hakkar it’s taking about aids and the bad blood
[1:53:46] Roxannamyu: @StaysafeTV Did you learn what the bruised debuf actually does?
[1:53:50] zakkoncrak: i think hes just unkillable
[1:53:51] GlitteryBeard: The only thing I'm thinking is that maybe during the world event the blood trolls might have a drop?
[1:53:53] Frostlicious: we arent dps racing 14m hp
[1:54:00] ATcaribou: im pretty sure triangle theory is the answer here too. its never failed us
[1:54:05] DarkEvilDIE: Then what is the point of being able to damage him?
[1:54:15] gamewatcher024: Just click on all the NPCs I think some of them have you turn in your pieces from zg and isn't there something that you can get a buff here I don't play the game I'm not sure
[1:54:24] Zaziben: durability loss too
[1:54:26] capybarairl: surely you can try elixir of coalesced regret
[1:54:26] Huskyfurball: we need asmon…0
[1:54:30] Slaanesh74: need a hematologist
[1:54:33] Roxannamyu: interesting, I was told that it increases damage taken
[1:54:36] maddie_1994: Has anyone else beat him yet?
[1:54:49] Frostlicious: Mass pray to the god
[1:54:54] lizcat_: @maddie_1994 I don’t think so
[1:54:56] M000gul: he probably drops 20 silver and one mageweave
[1:55:04] gamewatcher024: I remember that
[1:55:05] HotFlatDietPepsi: mankirks wife
[1:55:08] shinezlightz: chained spirit SCHIZo
[1:55:11] ruvsquirrel: does it persist through death?  Could there be a ghost you cant see?
[1:55:15] dinkleminkle: mankirks wife Sadge
[1:55:16] LeBiz: tupac obviously
[1:55:16] Seoken1: Maybe there is a LOA in ghost form somewhere
[1:55:20] Seoken1: during the event
[1:55:28] maddie_1994: @lizcat_ Ah, okay. There must be a way to get around that massive health boost
[1:55:39] CygnusC: did you lose your blood?
[1:55:42] SCjake23: maybe bwonsamdi is there lol
[1:55:48] fartguyl: why the hell would their be a guy to protect from the blood moon way out there?
[1:55:54] bottis96: go there as a spirit an see if there is somebody new that is dead
[1:56:09] Nappycans: @staysafetv are you going to be around tomorrow around noonish to help kill blood moon boss with everyone?
[1:56:17] ryro56: maybe you have to have like 255 blood or whatever
[1:56:19] stefanblagojevic: Its alliance quest for 4 tablets and their some lore about trolls (but its form 2004)
[1:56:28] realandtruephobe: I can camp out this spot next event to see if it's worth
[1:56:29] navyseal104: Was thinking the same thing fartguy lol
[1:56:31] Frostlicious: hahaha
[1:56:37] Roxannamyu: @StaysafeTV Someone told me the bruised debuff increases damage taken, but I haven't been able to confirm it

[1:57:14] gamewatcher024: Or just read about it first
[1:57:17] perturb25: @StaysafeTV this also could just be something that was meant to be killed at 60 because they probably didnt expect the entire server come together on 1 phase and work with both factions
[1:57:18] hxyfever: bruisemaxxxxxing
[1:57:19] chancerofl: @StaysafeTV if the boss gets a killing blow on you, you do not lose blood.

[1:57:55] Germond: I thought bruised just indicates how many times loa killed you
[1:57:56] Sourr09: maybe pop a elixer and run around and look for ghost npcs?
[1:57:59] endraga1: maybe form a trangle in STV see what points we come across?

[1:59:27] ballsofruenkiller: Who is to say their is another mechanics and its just meant to be that hard?
[1:59:33] MFpatrix: didnt a GM stop the attempt earlier to kill the boss?
[1:59:36] swidey221: @staysafetv maybe there’s a hint in the original event announcement?

[1:59:40] Dareka1111: ya, an rng spawn from a dead player
[1:59:47] Brenno_Mc: was the clue in the dev interviews when they said it couldn't be killed
[1:59:48] TakiitoPotato: and you can only use the dark rider trinket in right area
[1:59:57] plae007: @MFpatrix other attempts doing the same thing without a GM present suggests otherwise
[2:00:12] andypandynz: thats what it is
[2:00:20] SuperLost89: @StaysafeTV why cant you join a raid group after you get bloods?
[2:00:32] ballsofruenkiller: maybe its supposed to not be killed to 60 and u gotta kill it to unlock ZG down the road?
[2:00:34] N_Tys: doesnt heal as much when he kills a player
[2:00:34] taliwoush: he got nerfed yesterday
[2:00:38] rottkivo: he doesnt get a stacking damage buff I believe
[2:00:41] taliwoush: the heal has been reduced
[2:00:44] aoe_enjoyer: They lowered his T
[2:00:45] jrdman: bengal cat was also detained
[2:00:47] WillowJane: https://www.wowhead.com/blue-tracker/topic/us/season-of-discovery-hotfixes-february-27-1788040
[2:00:50] jrdman: datamined***
[2:00:51] taliwoush: it was data mined for people who been attempting for weeks
[2:01:00] Slaanesh74: his hematocrit was nerfed
[2:01:08] AchillezHeals: Kha’damu’s Blood Craze will no longer increase his damage dealt
[2:01:09] chancerofl: @StaysafeTV The boss used to grow larger after each time it healed, to extreme levels that was causing lag. After this "nerf" he nog longer gets as big. The only time he grows in size now is at 20%
[2:01:16] AchillezHeals: His the exact blue post wording
[2:01:18] Valencia_Pete: @ballsofruenkiller my thoughts exactly also possibly if they do ST for the next raid it would maybe be tied to that
[2:01:19] hurtenn: Kha’damu’s Blood Craze will no longer increase his damage dealt.
[2:01:20] WillowJane: 26th
[2:01:22] WhudaFxUp: Was 26th
[2:01:24] andypandynz: @chancerofl so nothing has channged? LUL wtf
[2:01:40] Sourr09: yeah thats it
[2:01:52] andypandynz: so people have achance to get away from him?
[2:01:53] ardice1: thats it
[2:01:57] MezeiPoloska: why does his damage matter btw
[2:01:59] chancerofl: pls read
[2:02:04] chancerofl: strimer
[2:02:04] Plokoon100: hey ../ yo
[2:02:06] ardice1: and it was done after a realm combined guilds to try t kil him
[2:02:07] ballsofruenkiller: @Valencia_Pete just a dangle to get players to do it. might be why a GM spawned and helped.. to get them to rabbit whole and not try to over power it with numbers.
[2:02:15] andypandynz: skizo classic andys
[2:02:15] aoe_enjoyer: Dust 2 dust
[2:02:21] MrWafer29: theres a hint on how to kill the boss in the war within expansion trailer
[2:02:32] ardice1: it was done the day after 300 people tried to kill him @StaysafeTV
[2:02:34] baakadii: Because if he is healing for part of the damage he deals, and he is dealing less damage, his health regen is more managable
[2:02:36] Plokoon100: Chat what are we dissecting
[2:02:36] taliwoush: @ardice1 Crusader strike, polar and wood D

[2:03:52] dirbagdan: I saw something about it in the Talmud
[2:03:53] swidey221: if that’s the only nerf there’s no way he’s meant to be killed as a result
[2:04:03] 5by_five: the secret is in hillary clintons emails---RiP
[2:04:07] Plokoon100: It was so him
[2:04:09] Ervill1: I've seen some hints in Last Epoch that could be helpful
[2:04:14] itsae__: Kappa
[2:04:17] NutterCircus: I bet it has something to do with ZG machanics beyond the blood.

[2:04:44] wAxome: NO
[2:04:44] Plathyy: HypePopcorn
[2:04:44] NutterCircus: doubt it
[2:04:44] WhudaFxUp: Check the replies, someone shows the GMs buff to not die.
[2:04:45] Valencia_Pete: no
[2:04:47] OptimusBanana420: x to doubt
[2:04:47] Frank4LuLz: i would
[2:04:47] taliwoush: I think he knew it oculdnt be killed
[2:04:49] Motelguy: yes POOGERS
[2:04:49] ballsofruenkiller: maybe it was a ploy?
[2:04:49] running_backing: a GM did show up
[2:04:51] mindsets_tv: probably just messing around
[2:04:52] MFpatrix: I think the GM increased the health pool of the boss
[2:04:52] Metaphix: dont think so
[2:04:54] plae007: @Motelguy That isnt the GM's PoV.... lol
[2:04:55] wAxome: ITS THE HP OF THE BOSS 67MILLION
[2:04:56] durham10: I think he was doing it so they would lose all the bloods and wipe
[2:04:59] cloudstrife543: what does bringing to altar do?
[2:04:59] HrdScp: they probably tried to show that it does nothing
[2:05:00] jrdman: GM IS A VIEWER 100%
[2:05:02] Julozas: ive been there at that altar with the boss kicking my teeth in
[2:05:03] running_backing: we saw the GM message
[2:05:03] Ervill1: GM was just farming his mount
[2:05:04] FTRTIZZ: no i think that , they seen there were gunna beat it and change it were it get health buff at 20%
[2:05:04] Julozas: nothing happened
[2:05:07] Seoken1: I think they had it flagged to be unkillable so he showed up to tank it for awhile to be nice
[2:05:10] carlos_the_7th: GMs showing up? My brother in Christ we are not in 2008 anymore
[2:05:10] chancerofl: @MFpatrix we just confirmed they didnt. happened again at 20%
[2:05:17] NutterCircus: that is what happened
[2:05:18] Seoken1: because he did tank the boss for awhile while invincible
[2:05:19] Plathyy: I love the theory crafting, if only it didn't all end up just being a retarded bug again
[2:05:19] hxzcc: no
[2:05:20] Ervill1: TheIlluminati
[2:05:21] limburgse: nope
[2:05:21] taliwoush: They dont have the staff to do it over multiple servers
[2:05:23] andypandynz: i think this is all fabricated by streamers to make content for youtube and naive people
[2:05:25] Frostlicious: idk there just is a phase 2 at 20%
[2:05:37] FTRTIZZ: no i think that , they seen there were gunna beat it and change it were it get health buff at 20%
[2:05:40] limburgse: GM showed up after XP increase
[2:05:43] FTRTIZZ: i just said that
[2:05:47] wAxome: yeah
[2:05:49] WhudaFxUp: Degreelessness Mode.
[2:05:49] StealthyNakroth: Why does everyone think he drops a mount?
[2:05:50] realandtruephobe: But then it happened again in our battle??
[2:05:51] taliwoush: We've got him to 20% without streamers, its not the GM
[2:05:53] WhudaFxUp: Was the GMs buff
[2:05:53] Xottz: if you werent suppose to kill him why does he take damage at all?
[2:05:54] Joewrx: yea
[2:05:54] Metaphix: COPIUM
[2:05:54] Sourr09: but its only 20%
[2:05:55] mintypete: Im the GM you got me
[2:05:56] N_Tys: they nerfed after people tried though
[2:05:56] mackearns: they could have done it way earlier
[2:05:56] FTRTIZZ: YUP
[2:05:57] realandtruephobe: It happened this time too though
[2:05:59] theorkanic: the gm was tanking
[2:05:59] dontbecold: 5Head
[2:06:00] iFennessey: why would they make him killable then
[2:06:02] aoe_enjoyer: We need deep forensics
[2:06:02] Pr0Pancakes: Did they kill it?
[2:06:03] NutterCircus: boss got 12mil HP after
[2:06:03] mackearns: it was their second attempt
[2:06:05] ballsofruenkiller: 100 percent could be.
[2:06:06] ardice1: what you dont know is, this nerf to the boss happened the day AFTER 300 people tried to kill him @StaysafeTV
[2:06:07] Rebcart: why release a boss that they don't want dead yet
[2:06:08] gh00775: they got him to 13% after that though
[2:06:10] Krabue: @StaysafeTV 2nd phase at 20%
[2:06:10] AxyTo: couldnt they have just toggle smth and make him unkillable from the start?
[2:06:11] h1bears: i doubt it
[2:06:14] craboskai: @StealthyNakroth p2 has no content so ppl are trying to make their own content OMEGALUL
[2:06:16] CYBERDEMON6669: GM are like the aliens working for the elites IRL
[2:06:17] holdenwook: i killed it
[2:06:18] WhudaFxUp: If you go to the replies on this tweet. Nys shows the GM
[2:06:20] Seoken1: At one point his health also went from 85% down to 50% in literally 1/2 second too @StaysafeTV I believe the gm's were making modifications on the fly
[2:06:21] KKonaStevieG: they were talking about how cool it would be if a gm showed up then a gm showed up so......
[2:06:23] Valencia_Pete: the boss' name is u mad backwards LUL
[2:06:26] taliwoush: We've gotten him to 20% without streamers, its not the GM doing it
[2:06:27] Rootwell_: sounds like kerafyrm the sleeper kill way back in EQ prime days
[2:06:27] Frostlicious: Earlier in the day the GM dropped the boss to 50% when they werent using blood
[2:06:28] saund: I think I figured it out. Maybe his starting hp and then his 20% hp numbers make coordinates ams at those coordinates he needs to be killed @staysafetv
[2:06:29] ballsofruenkiller: @Rebcart build hype for p3 when u can.. maybe it unlocks zg
[2:06:33] Sourr09: it has to be a mechanic for him to automatically get buffed HP at 20%, regardless of a GM
[2:06:34] HrdScp: i feel like they tried to show that pulling it to the altar doesn't do anything
[2:06:35] Metaphix: 300 ppl? ICANT
[2:06:39] Ervill1: bro this boss has thousands of grown men thinking about this all Wednesday
[2:06:43] aoe_enjoyer: Thats when he got huge right?
[2:06:46] Roxannamyu: Imagine trying to control who gets credit for the kill/ any loot
[2:06:55] Wingsofjanitor: I didn't think he was supposed to be killed anyways
[2:06:59] corsair714: LMAO
[2:07:00] realandtruephobe: We gotta have a different plan for the next one. Otherwise the same thing will happen
[2:07:00] kokoMcgogo: LOL
[2:07:00] Metaphix: sports ball Pog
[2:07:01] AxyTo: Maybe they just nerfed his abilities because they were interrupting the blood moon event too much?
[2:07:02] MrWafer29: the NFA
[2:07:03] aoe_enjoyer: NBA?
[2:07:04] iFennessey: the state of the economy

[2:07:14] Sowiloo: Joe biden
[2:07:17] mintypete: You guys see that newest Marvel movie about the NBA Funko pops?
[2:07:18] Metaphix: tay tay
[2:07:23] Rebcart: lets all think about tiktok shorts
[2:07:24] somejawns: maybe the gm dragged it to the alter so people lose their blood and the boss heals
[2:07:24] endraga1: im thinking about my fortnite aim
[2:07:25] ObieTV: WHAT IS LOVE BABY DONT HURT ME
[2:07:26] Xottz: the nba fucking sucks. the refs dont call shit you can just charge and travel all you want. its all offense no defense its not fun to watch
[2:07:28] SepeIio: NODDERS

[2:07:41] RealTy_Guy: BLOOD FOR THE BLOOD GOD
[2:07:43] saund: I think I figured it out. Maybe his starting hp and then his 20% hp numbers make coordinates ams at those coordinates he needs to be killed @staysafetv
[2:07:44] Metaphix: whata  culture it is FeelsStrongMan
[2:07:46] Vallun: modCheck
[2:07:48] helloimhaseo: ashes brought 60 ppl wood department brought over 160 people and polar brought a raid full or more we were thinking you had to have blood to stop the bleed leach from going off @StaysafeTV
[2:07:54] rlpqi: shotta flow has 7 dang
[2:07:54] Zazii1: read your chat
[2:07:54] PawgersHC: Take boss to multiple altars
[2:07:58] ballsofruenkiller: @Vallun is right lol
[2:08:02] Zazii1: what’s that message the emote
[2:08:09] yung_jed: maybe blizzard want us us to sepuku ?
[2:08:14] realandtruephobe: I was there, and I think the GM was just pulling him around not specifically to the altar
[2:08:25] realandtruephobe: We were already at altar
[2:08:29] ballsofruenkiller: @StaysafeTV u basically just had a slur in ur chat bro. from a unsub id kick.
[2:08:31] h1bears: keeping the blood prevents him from getting heakth on kills
[2:08:32] WhudaFxUp: Take him to ZG, to meet the true Blood God Hakker
[2:08:37] Slaanesh74: What triggered the tainted blood event?
[2:08:42] Etny2k: cqan you talk to the altar dead?
[2:08:45] Slaanesh74: is there a debuff from ZG?
[2:08:47] SepeIio: monkaHmm
[2:08:50] Sowiloo: what staff are you using
[2:08:50] CringeK: Have you tried casting more shadow bolts at him? Just a thought :)
[2:08:51] ObieTV: they dont want you to kill him until week 6
[2:08:51] Vallun: HUH
[2:08:52] ballsofruenkiller: @corsair714
[2:08:54] Arcsilin: i think nothing is coded for it ... blizz probably didnt think ppl would kill him
[2:08:54] dinkleminkle: What if we bring boss to a Zeplien
[2:08:57] HrdScp: someone said boobs

[2:09:15] mundanesickle: Bring boss to promo location at 20%?
[2:09:16] MalosAren: Why is the dismantle enchant so bad for casters?
[2:09:21] RanciusAdventures: I’m getting strong meta rune vibes for this stream

[2:15:46] seymourmoney: Where is savix from?
[2:15:46] Seoken1: watch his hp
[2:15:50] Frostlicious: that was the gm i think trolling
[2:15:51] saund: Does the coordinate 67 bring you somewhere interesting on the stv map?
[2:15:53] NutterCircus: the altar seemed like it dmaged him here before they knew about the blood.
[2:15:56] Seoken1: this is the answer
[2:15:59] Seoken1: I just don't have a better POV
[2:16:01] Plokoon100: Brought into the areana?
[2:16:06] weebpulper: did his health scale or something?
[2:16:09] swidey221: PLAYERS DYING ON ALTAT
[2:16:20] Sourr09: he lost his ears
[2:16:25] ghostbagster: Bobka backstab LUL
[2:16:28] Bropwnzl: big starfire critt ofc
[2:16:28] hurtenn: wasnt his total health dropping?
[2:16:36] hurtenn: his max was dropping
[2:16:37] Plokoon100: he wwas in the areana
[2:16:41] NutterCircus: this is before they knew about the blood
[2:16:50] Roxannamyu: Looks like when he's down In the arena
[2:16:59] gh00775: that was first attempt
[2:17:02] Frank4LuLz: in the arena, and sacrafices on the alter
[2:17:04] aoe_enjoyer: If there werent people aoe trolling they might have got it
[2:17:05] ryro56: oh wow we were killing him the wrong way. the gm was trying to stop us from doing it wrong
[2:17:06] fieryy___: yeah that was me on my rogue
[2:17:06] Aaltrix_: Warlock Rune Mob maybe did hit him with the fire debuff?
[2:17:06] gh00775: they got him to 13
[2:17:08] hurtenn: look at his max health
[2:17:09] fartguyl: stack his trophies super high go turn in to kill
[2:17:20] Xottz: maybe you need to kite the boss to the zg portal he goes into the raid and then a different blood god comes out that you kill
[2:17:23] 0_exclamation: brnig him into the arena and fight
[2:17:26] Roxannamyu: He went into the bottom of the arena
[2:17:26] tbseason: i solod him on retail
[2:17:28] SepeIio: monkaHmm
[2:17:32] Sourr09: he also has the event turned off on this attempt
[2:17:32] Plokoon100: gota be areana
[2:17:36] NutterCircus: This is when they tried to optout and raid
[2:17:37] SuperLost89: id try to kill him right there
[2:17:41] Mawshaw: SCHIZO
[2:17:43] Frostlicious: yea sardaco
[2:17:45] Roxannamyu: Something about the zone difference made him drop stacks, like when we normally enter and get the buff
[2:17:46] Twitchful_Duelist: @StaysafeTV maybe his ear stacks get dropped if he doesnt kill anyone, so you have to keep kiting him
[2:17:48] swidey221: it happened on top of altar with buncha players dying at same time
[2:17:48] ghostbagster: Xaryu?
[2:17:49] Seoken1: oo yeah lets check sardaco
[2:17:50] inflictawarlock: xaryu, sardaco
[2:17:50] ironbull007: does he turn in ears at altar?
[2:17:51] flugrman: the GM stepping in IS the clue. why did the GM join?
[2:17:51] gh00775: yea Sardaco
[2:17:52] cloudstrife543: maybe him being in the arena, he hurts himself @StaysafeTV
[2:17:52] LeBiz: sardaco and caryu is there at least
[2:17:53] Seoken1: xaryu was dead
[2:17:54] SepeIio: monkaHmm enhance
[2:17:55] Aaltrix_: Warlock Rune Mob maybe did hit him with the fire debuff? 󠀀
[2:17:56] HrdScp: xaryu sardaco shobek
[2:17:59] Plokoon100: im to lazy. chat go
[2:18:04] kokoMcgogo: Dying on the altar removes ear stacks?
[2:18:05] running_backing: Payo
[2:18:14] Sowiloo: sardoco
[2:18:15] robbiestacks: i dont think the GMs were ready  for a kill with loot table

[2:18:19] aoe_enjoyer: Yap OMEGALUL
[2:18:25] realandtruephobe: Shobek had a good POV for the second run
[2:18:59] LeBiz: probably the GM trolling them
[2:19:00] aoe_enjoyer: Big dam
[2:19:15] Frostlicious: This was before they knew about the blood and a gm was there aswell
[2:19:20] Plokoon100: Hes so fat.......... the stairs kill him
[2:19:28] Sowiloo: but he was inside the arena
[2:19:50] mundanesickle: We opted out of event on this run
[2:19:58] gh00775: this was first try. 2nd attempt was better
[2:19:58] Sourr09: the arena is considered an altar right?
[2:20:01] Plokoon100: Have we asked chat gpt to translate Kha damu?
[2:20:07] Multar_: It's gotta be people turning in ears
[2:20:14] Multar_: err blood
[2:20:19] flugrman: ask chatgpt how to defeat him
[2:20:19] SuperLost89: @StaysafeTV maybe you turn in blood at a certain quote he says?
[2:20:20] CygnusC: he's leaving the arena
[2:20:20] merksman: he got super close to altar though?
[2:20:21] yung_jed: our second pull was better
[2:20:22] SuperLost89: @StaysafeTV maybe you turn in blood at a certain quote he says??
[2:20:24] 0_exclamation: its lagging tho
[2:20:29] casskai: its a gm fucking with the health, just like a gm increasing the health at 20%
[2:20:29] realandtruephobe: No we were in the arena for the whole morning run
[2:20:31] nashonatorrr: i think hes in the arena
[2:20:32] realandtruephobe: or most of it
[2:20:32] sighwarlock: in the arena for a certain amount of time
[2:20:33] merksman: charged the altar? maybe
[2:20:34] cloudstrife543: it flagged him to dmg himself @StaysafeTV
[2:20:34] flugrman: maybe ask chatgpt?
[2:20:37] Frostlicious: And who is kiting him to arena if its a bad spawn
[2:20:39] crackerssx: i dont think location has to do with anything
[2:20:45] Stumarlyn: 1st step out is 1st dmg
[2:20:45] plae007: @Sourr09 the altar is behind the vendor there in arena
[2:20:49] LeBiz: Kite him into stitches and grab popcorn
[2:20:50] crackerssx: cause essentially you should be able to ust kill him wherever he spawns
[2:20:56] Lunights: the stairs if anything, which doesnt make sense
[2:20:57] Rootwell_: its too consistent of dmg reduction. cant chunk that quick
[2:21:01] mundanesickle: We were all opted out
[2:21:05] Roxannamyu: @cloudstrife543 How would he damage himself?
[2:21:06] shinezlightz: i legit think the more blood u have the more dmg you do to him because i was doing fireblast crits for 1100 in pvp gear
[2:21:06] WillowJane: could be people dying at the turn-in altar
[2:21:07] HrdScp: most opted out
[2:21:08] Sourr09: maybe the trick is to die and give him a giga amount of stacks??
[2:21:08] kokoMcgogo: In this raid they opted out
[2:21:09] realandtruephobe: ON THIS RUN WE OPTED OUT
[2:21:12] realandtruephobe: NO BLOODs
[2:21:13] ardice1: they all opted out
[2:21:13] Seoken1: everyone in this attempt was opted out though
[2:21:16] ardice1: none of them had blood
[2:21:16] SuperLost89: @StaysafeTV maybe it was triggered by something he said?
[2:21:17] crackerssx: this raid was opted out
[2:21:18] NutterCircus: this was before they knew about the blood
[2:21:18] CygnusC: GMs gotta be trolling
[2:21:25] Seoken1: so it could be because the 2nd raid came in and turned in
[2:21:28] shadowvypers: we think the gm hit the boss
[2:21:31] Frostlicious: GM was trolling pretty sure
[2:21:31] mrdrilla99: It was super laggy too. Things could be delayed
[2:21:33] NutterCircus: YES
[2:21:33] Sourr09: yes
[2:21:33] realandtruephobe: YES BUT HE HEALs
[2:21:33] Seoken1: yes
[2:21:34] Xottz: yes
[2:21:34] InsertYourseIf: yes
[2:21:34] Mister_Painter: yes
[2:21:35] ardice1: yes but he doesnt die
[2:21:35] Tooshkit: yes
[2:21:35] cloudstrife543: i think boss dmgs himself somehow
[2:21:36] limburgse: yes
[2:21:38] CygnusC: sardaco is not opted in
[2:21:38] FTRTIZZ: thats how they did the 1st time
[2:21:39] inflictawarlock: yes
[2:21:40] shadowvypers: yes
[2:21:42] ardice1: YOU need blood
[2:21:44] Xottz: they opted out to not get the raid debuff
[2:21:47] ardice1: to kill him
[2:21:50] KingCiolan: none of those 300 people were opted in
[2:21:52] Seoken1: its definitely possible
[2:21:53] realandtruephobe: If you don't have blood he heals
[2:21:53] limburgse: but you need bloos for boss his heals
[2:21:59] limburgse: blood*
[2:21:59] RokiBN: more likely than anything else
[2:22:02] InsertYourseIf: OMEGALUL TRUE
[2:22:02] GuyNotFromHarlem: possible
[2:22:08] Frostlicious: Yea GM knew boss would heal up
[2:22:14] running_backing: we had a few people opted in hitting the boss an hour ago
[2:22:15] HrdScp: looks like exaclty 10% tho, would be weird the gm does exactly that amount
[2:22:17] Strix0v0: The gm was def there, cause he made some comment at the end of the fight in chat
[2:22:17] shadowvypers: Gm tanked the boss at the later attempt
[2:22:19] NutterCircus: I dont think anyone could enter the arena area without dropping off blood at the altar.
[2:22:19] nicostance: does HC DF start at 12 am?
[2:22:21] Seoken1: ngl this is fun to investigate though lol
[2:22:22] shinezlightz: more bloods = more dmg from spells to boss thats my theory @StaysafeTV
[2:22:22] Sourr09: https://www.twitch.tv/xaryu/clip/ProudSpeedyAppleBleedPurple-7PEdmZujPkGuT4NF?filter=clips&range=24hr&sort=time
[2:22:23] dinkleminkle: Do we feel like we need a hint from the GMs or is this still doable?
[2:22:23] Roxannamyu: How do we know a gm was there? I missed that part
[2:22:24] aoe_enjoyer: Gm had sword of 1000 truths
[2:22:25] Stumarlyn: 1st step out of arena is 1st dmg
[2:22:26] itstnew: could it be he was trying to push them to discover it?
[2:22:30] noshot_bucko: i HATE the antichrist
[2:22:37] SuperLost89: what if he said a quote and thats when you need to turn in the blood to the altar? maybe people were there turning in blood when this happenend @StaysafeTV
[2:22:41] GlitteryBeard: What if you pray at the Altar of Zanza when the event starts?
[2:22:45] limburgse: GM was there twice, in first and second run
[2:22:48] brainlagxd: i mean theres a ss of someone targeting the gm on the crusader strike discord
[2:22:53] WhudaFxUp: Degreelessness Mode. TopDeck
[2:22:56] GlitteryBeard: There's also four little spots outside the altar that could require people to stand on it

[2:23:53] merksman: @staysafetv the hp drop seemed to be triggered by him charging the altar when he was in the arena! :)
[2:24:01] cook_pc: maybe the gm was removing health to make people think its possible
[2:24:03] kokoMcgogo: You are looking at 2 different BM attempts
[2:24:03] dirbagdan: OY VEY!
[2:24:04] WiseguyGG: yup
[2:24:05] realandtruephobe: 1st event was a raid group at arena, second one was at ZG with the GM
[2:24:05] radassbadass69: No, I wouldnt doubt it was programmed to not die by numerous different means
[2:24:06] Slaanesh74: I don't think they'd care
[2:24:09] shadowvypers: Gurabashi was 12:00 fail, they got him to 15% at 3:00 raid

[2:24:12] Frostlicious: Attempt one they had no buff 2nd event they used blood tactic
[2:24:12] Mobely__: why would they not want them to kill it tho
[2:24:13] MoonFluxx: gm showed up in the second attempt when they were all opted in event
[2:24:16] Xottz: i dont think the gms care they showed up because it was a large community event
[2:24:17] plae007: @StaysafeTV  the GM showed up 3 hours later at the next event where they did have blood
[2:24:18] FTRTIZZ: he would heal back
[2:24:19] RueRunsIt: GM obviously didnt want it to die.
[2:24:31] gh00775: need to opt out and try again
[2:24:33] dinalia: yes, two different attempts, at two different times.
[2:24:34] RueRunsIt: he buffed the HP by 20Mwhen they hit 20%
[2:24:34] Stumarlyn: his 1st pixel out of the arena he starts taking dmg
[2:24:35] Seoken1: he is correct
[2:24:36] ooober60: look at the time

[2:24:50] radassbadass69: what GMs Kappa
[2:24:50] Mister_Painter: i was present for both attempts, can confrim two differnet attempts
[2:24:51] mackearns: first attempt they weren't flagged second attempt they were
[2:24:52] coolcrazyguy72: organise a kill using realm discord to avoid horde/alliance killing each other
[2:24:58] DeadHead17: 1st attempt opt out 2nd opt in and tried to power through 20% no luck
[2:25:01] Eran_: why would the GM be such a fun police? I cant imagine that
[2:25:14] Slaanesh74: I really don't see why the GMs would care
[2:25:15] shadowvypers: they tried raid first and then realized thet\y needed bloods to succeed
[2:25:17] realandtruephobe: No the GM wasn't at this event
[2:25:22] andypandynz: that could make sense cause they dont make stuff that requires 100s of people
[2:25:23] realandtruephobe: GM wasn't at event with raid group
[2:25:27] stankypanky22: devs have already said its not meant to be killed KEKW
[2:25:29] realandtruephobe: it was second event
[2:25:29] Frostlicious: GM seemed to be poking fun with it i dont think they cared
[2:25:29] conspiraciesgamer: I think it was just for fun lol
[2:25:30] limburgse: @whitewatersalvo yes there was
[2:25:31] fartguyl: gm was at both
[2:25:31] Mister_Painter: that we know of, GM not present at first attemmpt
[2:25:34] saund: @staysafetv Are the coordinates 20 67 interesting on stv map?
[2:25:35] HrdScp: I think the gm wanted to guide them in the right direction by showing the altar does nothing
[2:25:39] limburgse: GM was on both events
[2:25:39] Seoken1: @whitewatersalvo I watched it live, the GM was at this event as well, they actually said something in chat. Unsure if they modded the hp though
[2:25:41] shadowvypers: there wer over 500 people in the second attempt both horde and alliance
[2:25:46] WiseguyGG: boss was at 19% 700k hp then all of a sudden it’s was like 13mill hp but still 19/20%
[2:25:46] realandtruephobe: @limburgse I was there for both runs lol. it wwas the second event
[2:25:46] Xottz: its 100% that
[2:25:47] WhudaFxUp: GM was at first event. Name was Bloodloafan
[2:25:50] Cluzza: if he dies the event ends they probably dont want that for people still grinding
[2:25:51] wavecadet: 100% that lol
[2:25:51] WhudaFxUp: Diff GM for attempt 2
[2:25:53] boofadose: who tf is sardako
[2:26:04] Xottz: the GMs dont care how they kill the boss im sure they want them to theory craft
[2:26:04] Seoken1: GM was 100% confirmed to be at both events, we just don't know what they did the 1st event
[2:26:06] RueRunsIt: 2 different GMS each time. i watched the stream
[2:26:07] ryro56: we havnt seen a gm show up in game for like 20 years
[2:26:07] hxzcc: Susge
[2:26:08] Dareka1111: she'll tweet about it
[2:26:08] limburgse: @whitewatersalvo kek, then you didnt see GMs comment after first event :)
[2:26:09] Strix0v0: That first attempt they had no chance - since they were opted out he was healing himself constantly anyway
[2:26:10] flugrman: GM knew he would be seen
[2:26:10] sighwarlock: it was kinda funny
[2:26:17] DilemmaSG: @StaysafeTV NO GM in SARD raid, GM in Xaryu raid was taunting and pulling boss to shrine
[2:26:18] shadowvypers: gm tanked the boss on second attempt
[2:26:24] realandtruephobe: @limburgse I saw that, doesn't mean he was there
[2:26:24] HrdScp: different gms both times
[2:26:31] Eran_: if it was me, Id be there just coz I wana witness the first kill

[2:27:05] HrdScp: boss gone time for some gaming
[2:27:05] Seoken1: dudes were watching streams
[2:27:08] Seoken1: and joined in
[2:27:10] shadowvypers: the key is that attackers need to have bloods to stop boss from healing

[2:28:14] JamesIRL: isnt there that one trinket that says "dont overuse: or something
[2:28:15] cook_pc: clearly you need a pendulum of doom to kill him
[2:28:15] fartguyl: attack chicken
[2:28:16] ballsofruenkiller: I legit said earlier that maybe its like the AQ boss that u need frost damage to kill.... maybe u need enough poison damage to the boss at 20 percent to poison his blood.
[2:28:17] sighwarlock: ITS SO FUN
[2:28:18] fuming_bumblebee: it just ported me to Old Ironforge
[2:28:19] shart_dart: I think he is un-killable and blizz will have to nerf/fix before he can be killed.
[2:28:22] MalosAren: That trinket put me on top of Naxx

[2:37:04] Etny2k: only thing on a mind of a shark is eat
[2:37:06] coolcrazyguy72: I think someone tried to kill you
[2:37:07] Strix0v0: Get some engineers to attach some laza beams to the sharks
[2:37:13] wavecadet: SCHIZO
[2:37:13] BigChoobs: this is obviously it
[2:37:20] sighwarlock: TRIANGLE SHARK THEORY SCHIZO
[2:37:27] atlasglassstudio: OBV ITS IT
[2:37:35] Xottz: drag the boss to zg portal at 20% he goes in and a new one pops out
[2:37:37] guidogang: are you giving up?
[2:37:38] realandtruephobe: Brute force it
[2:37:38] Vallun: its in gnomeregon
[2:37:44] Roxannamyu: Something at the ruins of the underwater Murloc area?

[2:37:46] Eran_: the shark must be so relieved his secret wasnt discovered yet
[2:37:51] Slaanesh74: need to attack him with tampons
[2:37:56] mintypete: kite the boss out there and have that boat run him over
[2:37:59] sighwarlock: is there a key point between all of the altars or are altars random
[2:38:08] srkosu: some dev is laughing right now because you were so close with the shark blood but then gave up pepeLaugh
[2:38:10] dj_clerik: what about the wandering ocean giants on the other side of BB?
[2:38:11] flugrman: it has to do with the blood and the altars for sure
[2:38:13] NutterCircus: We know the solution will be retarded though.
[2:38:15] Xottz: i think it has something to do with zg
[2:38:16] VdoTapes: what's a good alt to have?
[2:38:20] huTchpoker: what if it was something like that
[2:38:20] Lunights: is the evil rat still in booty bay? doubt thats it though
[2:38:25] weebpulper: Is there any new flavor text in sod that mentions loa or the new boss name?
[2:38:27] nightbot_v19: open ticket ask GM
[2:38:28] capybarairl: wouldnt coalesced regret maybe offer a different interaction with the chained spirits in general>?
[2:38:30] Althandan: send 100g to the boss and he will get killed for RMTing SCHIZO
[2:38:33] capybarairl: like ressing you with a buff or something
[2:38:42] siilver40: How did the blood boss drop sooo much hp that quick in the arena?
[2:38:43] sl1nky1981: You have to kite Kazzak all the way to him and they fight it out
[2:38:46] realandtruephobe: Maybe his health pool jumps based on how many kills (ears) he has
[2:38:47] aiwindels: have you tried organizing a raid to tackle the problem? lmao lmao
[2:38:48] Frostlicious: phase 2 40 people must pray to him and he flops over
[2:38:57] HrdScp: maybe you need something that takes a while to get to do more damage at 20% for timegating reasons
[2:38:57] Xottz: maybe at 20% the boss will go into the zg portal and a new killable boss pops out
[2:38:57] Haloxs: @blugoriking any tank/healer
[2:38:59] VenomVeinZ: that naga alter
[2:39:06] NutterCircus: The Nagas...

[2:41:10] AchillezHeals: 44,44
[2:41:10] tw_30: what if hes not meant to die
[2:41:17] Xottz: maybe blizzard wasnt lying this boss doesnt die. there is some other thing that happens
[2:41:17] NotDessx: I just don't think he's meant to die
[2:41:17] NutterCircus: We couldnt dps him past 20% this last time.
[2:41:19] sighwarlock: take him to yozamba isle
[2:41:21] stankypanky22: devs said hes not meant to die already
[2:41:21] kb_h: what if its just classic blizzard live tuning
[2:41:32] tw_30: fair fair fair
[2:41:32] SuperLost89: i really think theres something with one of his quotes. like, when you see it, you turn in blood at the altar to damage him
[2:41:33] sketchinz: Bring it to bloodsail bucaneers
[2:41:34] stankypanky22: nerfed his damage? so hes not so annoying to be around?
[2:41:35] radassbadass69: so he doesnt ramage as hard
[2:41:36] bottis96: just has to find the debuff
[2:41:36] Frayeen: whats the point killing him anyway? u dont even get anything
[2:41:37] sl1nky1981: And why not just make him immune to damage?
[2:41:37] Wingsofjanitor: make it easier to fight near him
[2:41:38] Xottz: My theory is take him to zg portal at 20%
[2:41:41] SetDog1: f this boss
[2:41:41] realandtruephobe: @NutterCircus we were still doing damage, his health pool just jumped from like 600k to 68m
[2:41:44] griffithismydaddy: @staysafe did your youtube UI get a stupid update as well
[2:41:47] coolcrazyguy72: what if you need to stack troll priest racial to reduce health regen
[2:41:50] mattynuts: @StaysafeTV go to tanaris to the isalnd directly west
[2:41:56] Ariosity: !microphone
[2:41:58] mattynuts: island*
[2:42:09] radassbadass69: We could probably kill him at 60 if not at 50, I doubt anyone will pull it off in phase 2
[2:42:10] stankypanky22: thats very different from self healing bro
[2:42:13] realandtruephobe: That nerf could be just them nerfing him for the normal event stuff
[2:42:15] Ariosity: tyty
[2:42:20] CygnusC: it's just less damage dealt
[2:42:25] kb_h: have you investigated the "secret agent" NPCs? just another SoD loose end
[2:42:27] jiggalake: crazy blood
[2:42:32] Roxannamyu: Sorleigga was a wow dev and not a GM?
[2:42:33] mintypete: its what makes him crazy for blood
[2:42:40] siilver40: I think every altar drains the blood boss a certain %, so you have to bring the boss to each altar in order to kill him, since STV arena got him to what 50% from 97% or what it was and then move him to the next altar
[2:42:51] sighwarlock: what if we actually take him to the altar we turn in the coins and shit at 60
[2:43:06] mattynuts: @whitewatersalvo I think it's possible they felt like he was just one shotting too many players at a time... but I don't think that's the case.
[2:43:09] kb_h: holy spring water has been in the game for a long time
[2:43:18] cloudstrife543: its a hidden buff
[2:43:19] NutterCircus: PogU
[2:43:23] realandtruephobe: @siilver40 We were able to DPS him down without this. the issue is that he gains health at 20%
[2:43:25] cloudstrife543: HIDDEN BUFF YOU NEED FOR BOSS DEFINITELY
[2:43:27] andypandynz: u need to make the npc drink it
[2:43:28] mattynuts: WHAT?!
[2:43:30] Xottz: maybe get some for during the boss
[2:43:35] Frostlicious: tomorrow i think theyll get through the dps check and we will see what happens
[2:43:36] JettStreamLive: I might have a cheese way to kill him
[2:43:37] aoe_enjoyer: This is the maga alter?
[2:43:43] Frayeen: its a quest item for alliance quest?
[2:43:43] VenomVeinZ: KEKW
[2:43:43] lylo_tv: HUH
[2:43:43] QuestFor420: monkaHmm

[2:44:23] coconust1: The Swastika is tilted, that's different

[2:45:29] RueRunsIt: yuck
[2:45:30] coolcrazyguy72: o.O
[2:45:32] siilver40: @whitewatersalvo yeah i saw but i just find it so random that in the STV arena he suddenly drop that much hp that quick, it has to do with the altars in some way since when you get him down to 20% he gain hp , so my theory is that a certain altar after 20% gets him low hp or remove that hp buff or what it is
[2:45:39] cook_pc: you need to stack bleed effects on him during the correct time of the month
[2:45:43] Joewrx: What class?
[2:45:43] andypandynz: hype

[2:46:56] maddie_1994: I'll make sure to ask the questions anyway
[2:47:03] siilver40: @whitewatersalvo like how many altars are there in STV 5 or 6? it might be that u have to use them in a certain order as well in order to remove that immortal buff that the blood boss gets at 20%
[2:47:03] liceol: hey whta is this?
[2:47:09] TheWhiteRabbitxX: yeah dawg sstvAYAYA

[4:47:26] Somra: STREAMER QUEUE madsMad
[4:47:29] realandtruephobe: I got DCd and cant relog
[4:47:29] cyonara74: @StaysafeTV did you see how a GM was trying to help streamers kill the STV boss?  If boss drops anything, the GMs will have to help every realm kill the boss.
[4:47:35] zaebot3000: Streamer PRIO
[4:47:37] MacEleven: if you put your tauren in TB to craft youll save on reagents
[4:47:37] clozer_kek: he's a character
[4:47:38] DobsonWireless: your hogging the servers
[4:47:52] cockjab: he def wasnt helping
[4:47:54] Tesla369: are other realms actually jealous
[4:47:59] Milanesa_De_Pollo: Russians are DDOsing the servers Sadge we need to send our troops to fight them and stop them from doing this.
[4:47:59] Mr_fantastic123: he helped keep the boss alive
[4:48:02] cyonara74: someone said the gm was tanking
[4:48:02] cockjab: if anything they made it harder
[4:48:04] MacEleven: if you put your tauren in TB to craft youll save on reagents like silk thread, vials etc
[4:48:04] OGstrudel: i think its quiete the opposite
[4:48:06] UtmostTurnip: able to log back in
[4:48:06] windatar: My theory is he was there to help the boss not die.
[4:48:07] Somra: your fat ass is clogging the servers madsMad
[4:48:08] Steiny1784: I think GM intervened
[4:48:11] OGstrudel: yeah exactly
[4:48:19] Plokoon100: you caused a server crash?
[4:48:21] IAmLubes: I GOT AN UPDATE????
[4:48:24] clozer_kek: yakslappers
[4:48:27] nearoz123: yup they dont want boss to die
[4:48:33] bigmugtv: i think ur right
[4:48:35] OGstrudel: true and real
[4:48:36] Detrect: boss not meant to be killed
[4:48:36] Steiny1784: boss health jumped up at 20%
[4:48:41] cyonara74: blizz should just say "hey the boss drops nothing"
[4:48:54] pheigngaming: it kind of looks like when he gets to 20% whatever number of ears he has he gets extra hp based on that
[4:48:55] AceOfFlame: why did they nerf the bosses hp though ?
[4:48:57] Tchoup504: dumb theory why would they give a shit if the boss dies
[4:48:57] smellyconor: Susge
[4:49:02] zaebot3000: Why do you think the GM did that? @StaysafeTV
[4:49:12] cyonara74: mageweave = $$
[4:49:15] RiraiJ: time to farm tanaris pirate :D
[4:49:16] Cluzza: maybe they dont want you to kill him, cause if he dies the event ends im guessing
[4:49:20] lylo_tv: TRUEING Gm mage sure them mfers didnt kill him
[4:49:25] lylo_tv: made*
[4:49:29] colejr27: u dont need that much mageweave lol to to get past 225
[4:49:32] gakguski: you guys are fucking the servers for HC wow - fuck off
[4:49:34] nexram74: @StaysafeTV dont actually need that much for 225
[4:49:42] realandtruephobe: No, only the 1st time
[4:49:44] cyonara74: they think boss drops that mount.
[4:49:46] FrostsWorld: Nah that was the first time. Where they didn't get to 20%
[4:49:49] whatever: has anyone killed him
[4:49:50] realandtruephobe: The second time we were not in a raid group
[4:49:53] lylo_tv: that boss had 83 copper on him OMEGALUL
[4:49:54] skoobss: incorrect. when the health thing happened it was the 2nd attempt that was not in a raid group
[4:49:56] FrostsWorld: The second time they opted in and thats when they got it to 20%
[4:50:03] thaplayboy69: yes
[4:50:04] Lunights: @whatever na
[4:50:05] Brewsy_: yup
[4:50:06] thaplayboy69: totally
[4:50:08] realandtruephobe: Thats how i feeel about aliens
[4:50:10] Roxannamyu: demotivation
[4:50:12] Toolt: i think the stacks gets turned into HP and dam, just like the boss in ZG
[4:50:13] RiraiJ: lol every clickbait youtube video
[4:50:13] eshonxv: yep
[4:50:14] Cluzza: we know drowning him doesnt work
[4:50:16] cyonara74: all blizz needs to do is say that the boss drops nothing.  leave the boss alone.
[4:50:18] Cluzza: lol
[4:50:25] w3zb0: who is Satoshi Nakamoto
[4:50:33] ripwarlock2: You dont need mageweave to level tailoring.. just make waylaid stuff
[4:50:34] bindwounds: @StaysafeTV did you sell all the mageweave you got when PL'ing druid? :(
[4:50:50] ardice1: @StaysafeTV coincidence that after the guys in the afternoon tried, theres a maintence for thursday now?
[4:50:51] Steiny1784: @cyonara74 that wouldn’t stop people from trying to get world first boss kill.
[4:50:53] wreckit4413: So i was part of that stv event at 3 today and we was all broken up into 5 man groups because if you are in a raid you get a debuff
[4:50:55] Plokoon100: @whatever they need your power
[4:50:58] OptimusBanana420: pepoG
[4:51:14] Detrect: boss is a new world boss that were supposed to be lvl 60 for is my theory
[4:51:19] MrChaynes: why would they require more people when their servers are dogshit lol
[4:51:19] Phalloides60: who says the boss is even supposed to be killable?
[4:51:24] ChefJoe925: did u kill it?
[4:51:28] inspiredtv: @Phalloides60 blizz
[4:51:34] Maehdras18: @StaysafeTV  health increase is based on ear stacks or bruised
[4:51:35] clozer_kek: big mthrfkn pumpers. lol
[4:51:37] neimac2: 14mil at 20%
[4:51:38] Phalloides60: perhaps the gm was showing them even with his help, they cant do it
[4:51:41] Maehdras18: gotta be
[4:51:42] Steiny1784: same group trying again at 12:00 pm server time tomorrow.
[4:51:46] QuestFor420: LOOOOOOOOOOOL
[4:51:48] OptimusBanana420: no shot
[4:51:50] lylo_tv: @Phalloides60 The GM did today OMEGALUL
[4:52:01] zaebot3000: So you basically need like 500 people
[4:52:06] ardice1: 2k
[4:52:06] Steiny1784: 20% was 13M
[4:52:07] lylo_tv: @lylo_tv that mfer said "Not today"
[4:52:07] antmd15: No his hp was only 13.4mil
[4:52:08] NutterCircus: not enough
[4:52:09] rocknsake: a lot
[4:52:10] yuckil: just get soda on this
[4:52:10] helloiamlucas: 500 yeah
[4:52:11] ripwarlock2: we were like 2k + today
[4:52:13] ardice1: theyll get 2k
[4:52:14] antmd15: 67m was his max hp
[4:52:15] yuckil: or asmon
[4:52:16] ardice1: +
[4:52:17] dreamworldzone: they got kicked off line too much
[4:52:17] ChefJoe925: call asmon
[4:52:19] sanctusirl: We need Asmond
[4:52:21] Tee__Gee_: in same layer? not enough
[4:52:22] beefsalsa: whats up with these ddos attacks
[4:52:36] neimac2: its at 13.4 though is what they were at
[4:52:39] ardice1: 2,000 people theyll have
[4:52:44] ChefJoe925: but then at that point with all the people on that layer they start getting lag and dec
[4:52:45] chancerofl: no his max hp goes up to 67m, so his 20% when it goes up is only 13mil
[4:52:46] Steiny1784: enough to crash the servers. LUL
[4:52:47] mortalschield: hc server crashed LUL
[4:52:54] yuckil: but my lord there is no such force
[4:52:57] lylo_tv: 8k
[4:52:58] gakguski: everytime you try to do the blood boss it crashes HC servers and people are losing their characters
[4:53:01] IAmLubes: his max health is 60 mil, %20 of that
[4:53:05] neimac2: 20% of 67 mil
[4:53:07] chancerofl: no thats wrong
[4:53:09] realandtruephobe: nah it goes to 13m out of 67
[4:53:13] CraigsListQT33: it was like 13.7m of 67m
[4:53:22] CraigsListQT33: before it changed it was like 670k/3.7m
[4:53:22] inspiredtv: no thats not right at 20% his MAX health goes up to 67m
[4:53:35] bobbuildsitt: Off of the amount of people he has killed. His love increases
[4:53:46] clozer_kek: theorycrafting ... works
[4:53:47] letholdis: yah 500
[4:53:48] bobbuildsitt: At 20%
[4:53:53] mattbarz989: anyone put the kiss debuff on him?
[4:53:59] TakiitoPotato: doable
[4:54:01] zaebot3000: Divide that by 300
[4:54:02] chancerofl: For example, we got him to 20% with 13 minutes left. and by the time ran out we still had 9.3mil to go.
[4:54:11] Cluzza: but hes hard stuck at 20%
[4:54:29] poorboy55: ez
[4:54:30] Cluzza: since the GM he hasnt went below 20%
[4:54:37] coolcrazyguy72: 102 degrees at the moment and aircon broken :(
[4:54:37] QuestFor420: everyone needs to help thats the issue
[4:54:40] realandtruephobe: And lag
[4:54:42] lylo_tv: 107 trillion dps per mili-second
[4:54:43] ChefJoe925: yo i just talked to asmongold he said "yea i heard about that"
[4:54:45] OGstrudel: lag
[4:54:47] zaebot3000: YOur lagging to shit
[4:54:48] clozer_kek: bliz be trollin
[4:54:56] antmd15: @Cluzza He went down to like 17% lol they just didnt have enough time to get it lower
[4:54:56] Cluzza: and broken gear lol
[4:55:00] OhMyMookie: and all the zombies
[4:55:01] realandtruephobe: its like on the edge of possible though
[4:55:02] zaebot3000: It seems like it was designed to be unkillable
[4:55:12] nearoz123: he cant be killed with raids opted out of the pvpv?
[4:55:22] spanij: !server
[4:55:23] Nightbot: NA-HORDE-CRUSADER STRIKE
[4:55:32] sanctusirl: Are there any high level guards in stv?
[4:55:34] cyonara74: someone should just destroy UC
[4:55:46] Steiny1784: @zaebot3000 That was probably the intent, but that won’t stop streamer community from finding a way.
[4:55:47] yuckil: all in one tiny area
[4:55:47] wavecadet: yeah thats dumb
[4:55:50] yuckil: lololl
[4:55:54] Purplexxityy: asking to have server issues
[4:55:55] RiraiJ: yeah pretty dumb
[4:56:07] Gerald_zdg: what if its not intended to be killed?
[4:56:10] sanctusirl: I'll get it next phase
[4:56:11] CygnusC: they said the boss is not supposed to be an objective
[4:56:13] cyonara74: boss and every player must be inside the arena
[4:56:13] OptimusBanana420: already cant put 40 players in the same area without lag
[4:56:14] RiraiJ: alreayd annoying enough getting everyone on for raid nights, imagine 500 people lololol
[4:56:20] asonoftheholyghost: Is sod p2 still popular?
[4:56:29] problys: Id assume they never intended for the boss to die
[4:56:30] Toolt: considering blizzard server cant handle 400 poeple pvp in a small arena ye.
[4:56:34] cyonara74: mageweave bolts cheaper?
[4:56:39] cyonara74: you could go fishing
[4:56:47] wavecadet: he needs to make bolts to lvl prob
[4:56:48] Seabrookx: there is probably not even one mechanic cause this fucking boss is not supposed to be killed xD
[4:57:08] gachimane_: New place?
[4:57:12] ardice1: right after afternoon group went, they posted theres a maintenance thursday now.. coincidence? @StaysafeTV
[4:57:17] yabeautifulbastard: @Seabrookx that part
[4:57:23] itstnew: INSIDE AT LAST
[4:57:26] cyonara74: whats your new address?
[4:57:31] coolcrazyguy72: are you planning to go all the way to 60 on sf hardcore?
[4:57:38] windatar: Some of the stuff your making probably fills commerce crates some of those go for like 2-8 gold each on the auction house after the crate change.
[4:57:40] sanctusirl: Blizzard didn't think anyone would want to kill it so they're working on making a secret to kill it and a loot table lol.
[4:57:59] Tee__Gee_: im pretty sure its happening right now
[4:58:00] cyonara74: 5k more rep to exalted with wsg
[4:58:15] yabeautifulbastard: if it's unkillable, it doesn't have a loot table
[4:58:30] NutterCircus: would be cool if they did something like an event to open up ZG as a lvl 40 raid.
[4:58:32] clozer_kek: they want the monthlies
[4:58:54] yuckil: does it have phases
[4:58:59] dirbagdan: I too would like to kill the large evil troll NODDERS
[4:59:05] mattbarz989: i bet he dropds a buncha stv gold coins
[4:59:06] yabeautifulbastard: aggrend
[4:59:12] Blockaaattv: not supposed to be killed this phase due to its mech with giving people bool who kill by it. Next phase it will be killable
[4:59:15] OptimusBanana420: 225
[4:59:17] zaebot3000: 225
[4:59:20] Ryafl1: 250 will be pretty hard
[4:59:22] Lunights: that's gonna be hard to do
[4:59:23] bindwounds: 225?
[4:59:29] bindwounds: Unless you from the futura
[4:59:29] windatar: If enough people try to kill it, Blizz might make the boss killable even if its not killable now. A kind of, "Holy shit, their trying to kill him? We didn't think they would try that. Maybe we should create a way for them to actually succeed? But he doesn't have a loot table. Quick Bob go and keep him alive." Type deal.
[4:59:33] letsgetgoingyo: epic mats are so cheap now. Costs like 11g for the leather one
[4:59:46] stimpack_01: Are you guys gonna try to kill the server again? I mean kill the boss.
[4:59:52] GrimmzyF: GrimmzyF subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 31 months! no
