[7:36:29] kiKk3r: I miss the old days
[7:36:30] The_palumbo: I also dont have time to play while I work, but i can watch/listen to streams
[7:36:38] Istunlocklocalpensioners: @kiKk3r oh they'll be back, wait for phase 2
[7:36:50] The_palumbo: @elaktomte same but google cloud haha
[7:36:50] stevez0r: pshero works hard, but he plays harder

[7:37:56] StreamElements: twitch.tv/psherotwo for variety
[7:37:57] elaktomte: I am here for the chill gameplay. The Bob Ross of pvp :P
[7:37:59] ama__deus: Should have paid what I asked then catREE
[7:38:01] The_palumbo: @elaktomte do you hate yourself? haha fuck java its so ugly
[7:38:16] thrixog: java isn't the worst, but I prefer C#
[7:38:26] taylorfest: miss the tree
[7:38:30] shifumester: im here bcouz you so chill.. its cool i like it
[7:38:30] kb645: kvosta psheroo
[7:38:32] Istunlocklocalpensioners: what
[7:38:35] thrixog: but that comes with ms
[7:38:39] koboldich: any python enjoyers...? PausersHype
[7:38:42] varatupaj: wat
[7:38:43] kiKk3r: @elaktomte that's actually the best way to describe him.. @PsheroTV use this as your tagline: "The Bob Ross of WoW!"
[7:38:47] noticip: depends how good you are
[7:38:47] ama__deus: I think being paid to do the pooping is more common
[7:38:48] The_palumbo: I think it goes both ways
[7:38:51] thrixog: I used to code a lot of python
[7:38:53] stevez0r: money upfront
[7:39:07] Manharald: i've tuned in the stream and suddenly talk subject is somebody is taking a dump on others
[7:39:15] kiKk3r: you need to be an "influencer" and go to Dubai (if you know, you know)
[7:39:16] struci: Madgi What happens in the bathroom is between me and my poop contractor tyvm
[7:39:27] ama__deus: Oddly enough, another WoW streamer (shall not be named) just asked chat for how much they'd let someone poop on them. Is there some poopery going on behind the scenes? MegaSus
[7:39:31] The_palumbo: so fucking sick
[7:39:31] Istunlocklocalpensioners: literally shitting on people
[7:39:36] Istunlocklocalpensioners: I hope that isn't a thing
[7:39:37] koboldich: struci Madgi 💢
[7:39:45] bakerpls: @elaktomte ive only ever tried java and i kinda liked it. came easy to me and i like easy :D any other thing i should look into?
[7:39:47] thuglynx: sir yesir！
[7:39:51] kiKk3r: you dont  do it int he bathroom
[7:39:54] stevez0r: depends on what kind of poop it is
[7:39:57] kiKk3r: ...or so, I've heard
[7:40:02] Istunlocklocalpensioners: Alright i'm done with humanity.
[7:40:04] AnthonySo1337: oh its a thing
[7:40:06] taylorfest: vince mcmahon says you can shit on anyones head and its fine
[7:40:13] protein_deficient: It is a thing
[7:40:16] AnthonySo1337: rich guys love it
[7:40:21] Kameril: basic saturday night at Dubai
[7:40:23] elaktomte: @bakerpls Go for it :) . It doesn't matter too much which language you learn. If you learn Java, you basicly learn the other object oriented languages at the same time, like C# etc. You should diversify and learn Javascript as well, as its almost mandatory to know nowadays
[7:40:29] stevez0r: Diarrhea express is my go-to, would recommend it
[7:40:32] ama__deus: Just use easily cleanable tarp, chat. Don't ask me how I know.
[7:40:35] kiKk3r: it's called the "Dubai special" for a reason
[7:40:39] Istunlocklocalpensioners: wtf
[7:40:41] struci: it is
[7:40:42] thrixog: @elaktomte I would say if you like it, stick with it. And then get into kotlin which is java but 10x
[7:40:43] walleyed_christ: it's pretty tame if you get down underneath a glass coffee table
[7:40:44] Istunlocklocalpensioners: bruh
[7:40:53] protein_deficient: XDD
[7:40:58] PexLoad: WutFace

[7:41:02] Istunlocklocalpensioners: god
[7:41:05] kiKk3r: I perhaps invented that just now
[7:41:05] ama__deus: Why would you google that CatNotLikeThisMeow
[7:41:11] kiKk3r: ..maybe
[7:41:11] taylorfest: no one knows about the vince mcmahon head shit?
[7:41:15] struci: Kappa

[7:42:11] kiKk3r: I want to try it..but I want to be the one that's doing it, not taking it
[7:42:19] Istunlocklocalpensioners: All Dubai'd out nadedClown
[7:42:19] ama__deus: Stop self-reporting, chat

[7:43:05] AnthonySo1337: Dubai'd out, you know
[7:43:14] Gullah: dubai'd out means the car was covereed in shit
[7:43:14] AnthonySo1337: gold plated everything
[7:43:18] AnthonySo1337: Kappa
[7:43:23] stevez0r: he is a man of culture
[7:43:24] ama__deus: Bababadaba.
[7:43:25] elaktomte: @bakerpls I did 3 years on uni, doing primarily Java and Javascript and before you ask, Java and Javascript are as similar as Car and Carpet :D

[7:44:08] SilentRogue: @stevez0r this
[7:44:10] The_palumbo: yes, scatting in Jazz is basically singing onomatopoeia's
[7:44:18] struci: I just had to listen to that song again and it's great
[7:44:19] kiKk3r: you know the one?
[7:44:26] StreamElements: 📸 https://www.instagram.com/psherotv/ for Kote heroKOTE and IRL stuff.
[7:44:27] AnthonySo1337: That guy had a really bad stutter so he made that song to show if he has a stutter and can sing you can too LUL
[7:44:30] The_palumbo: @stevez0r KEKW
[7:44:40] ama__deus: If you know the lyrics to that song, your brain's wired different YEP
[7:44:43] kiKk3r: look up Serenity Now WoW funeral

[7:49:19] Istunlocklocalpensioners: that's cringe
