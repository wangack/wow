[2:57:25] ls832onhs: @Mahca_ war stomp isnt that good really but the stamina for tanks could be useful if bad, but troll berserking is best for tanks

[3:16:16] Piggymain: Classic.+: 1. Give both ally and horde option to play paladin and shaman. 2. Make protection paladin and guardian druid viable in raids by changing their talent trees a bit. 3. Add challenge modes to dungeons that award extra loot to give players more of a reason to do old dungeons etc..
