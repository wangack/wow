[0:24:12] Goku_Flexx: is there a macro to use vengeful retreat without moving too much? trying to figure that out for entangling.
[0:24:16] MierkaBlue: I like Drogoh and he put's up a lot of effort, but Drogoh who hasnt had time to learn the keys and Growl who sleeps badly - I dunno, I think either would work with these paramenters. I think both are great healers, the Fyrak prog at the last moment was a bit rough spot for both. <3

[4:40:46] KimothyXo: why do most DHs play feed and last resort but you seem to play Soulcrush along with a lot of US Dh’s?
[4:40:55] n0s0upbr0: it’s just getting past witches as holy is tough
[4:41:02] n0s0upbr0: soulthorns boss is a complete meme as holy tho
[4:41:06] n0s0upbr0: not even a factor
[4:41:14] Cruzerthebruzer: cause they're cowards
[4:41:25] HarveyPls: i dont do more than like 24 on my priest and holy is op at this key level i swear
[4:41:37] MBG_95: @kimothyxo more people play soulcrush than LR
[4:41:44] HarveyPls: i never believed it but u can just do 100k dps for free im not good enough to do that as disc
[4:41:50] n0s0upbr0: it’s a good key for holy even the trash mobs like etch and shit
[4:41:59] n0s0upbr0: it’s just like single target blaster heals
[4:42:14] KimothyXo: @mbg_95 yeah I see Soulcrush on streams, but subcreation seems to point at last resort
[4:42:28] Satimy: Cant wait for Floorki to get legendary
[4:42:50] n0s0upbr0: what if the meta is disc for witches
[4:42:54] n0s0upbr0: swap holy rest of key

[4:43:06] n0s0upbr0: disc for witch
[4:43:53] MBG_95: @kimothyxo not really? Top build is soulcrush & like 6 of top 10 are, if anything it's 50/50
[4:46:04] KimothyXo: @mbg_95 oh I was looking at overall. I just looked at spec tree and I see what you mean! thanks!

[4:49:17] ottomr1990: i accidentally did 1 key this week without retreat and i wanted to delete the character
[4:49:31] HarveyPls: i wish warr still had at least one key where u can do giga reflects

[4:50:04] n0s0upbr0: u can never justify bringing a blood Dk to a key especially on fort week
[4:50:13] c3rby_: It really is comparatively
[4:50:25] c3rby_: they cant shut down groups, they fall over and dont bring buffs
[4:50:33] n0s0upbr0: the only tank im rolling with on fort week is a vdh or prot paladin
[4:50:38] n0s0upbr0: or the key is significantly harder
[4:51:09] n0s0upbr0: what can a blood Dk do for me on first pull of rise on fort week ? let coroding volley go off V
[4:51:32] Vyerre: @n0s0upbr0 people can just kick those.
[4:51:35] Zynneh: they can grip them and solo kick them
[4:51:46] HarveyPls: or a vdh can do it with his eyes shut with 1 global
[4:52:04] HarveyPls: and not die
[4:52:05] n0s0upbr0: yeah or I could no discord a vdh in the key and he will do everything he needs to those mobs and they’ll die
[4:52:16] ottomr1990: can they even shut their eyes they're on fire
[4:52:21] jin_ae: there arent that many volleys, you just need to eat more normal bolts on non vdh
[4:52:29] Zynneh: sounds like you've only played with bad blood DKs
[4:52:30] Docaan: @ottomr1990 asking the real questions
[4:52:38] gargamelkreampie: blood isnt that bad vdh and prot pally are just insane
[4:52:53] HarveyPls: that does kinda just make them bad by comparison
[4:53:04] c3rby_: I dont even need to shut my eyes on VDH. im fully immersed with my blindfold
[4:53:10] Zynneh: no, it just makes them less good
[4:53:14] Zynneh: not bad
[4:53:19] n0s0upbr0: yeah they’re so bad I mean for me it’s ppal>vdh>brewmaster
[4:53:32] HarveyPls: same difference imo but i guess its how u call it
[4:53:51] bhanter: brewmasta>vdh gigaChatting
[4:54:05] gargamelkreampie: brew scales up better fs
[4:54:07] n0s0upbr0: brewmaster does a fuck ton of damage and brings raid buffs
[4:54:20] pinkqy: @bhanter let him cook
[4:54:28] HarveyPls: yeah brew is sick but still just gapped too hard
[4:54:34] ottomr1990: that pull wasn't very "4th place in MDI time trials" of you
[4:54:42] HarveyPls: some pulls so aids to do as brew comparatively
[4:54:54] n0s0upbr0: oh ya I played with one and the grouping is a struggle with them
