[1:31:13] Table_Slam: @P_and_A no one thinks they're bad, the other tanks are just better. druids aren't the best at any part of tanking, they're 2nd best at everything basically
[1:31:14] typing_with_one_hand: damn they pulling in top tier caster talent for this
[1:31:16] CritcobainTV: It's not that bears are bad, it's just that there's other options that are better, so you bring feral dps
[1:31:31] smartflex: First team that finish World Tour, do they get any advantage or does it have nothing to say who finish World Tour first?
[1:31:39] 2woDads: That is why Vanilla speedrunning was amazing
[1:31:42] CritcobainTV: @typing_with_one_hand Calling Zirene top tier is a bit of a stretch Keepo
[1:31:44] eratrius: I believe I have been misled. Is parsing not the best guild metric?
[1:31:51] FranciscoTheMage: they trying to get the best gear they can
[1:31:57] RelapseQT: A bear tank could never get world first roflgatorSmile
[1:32:00] P_and_A: @Table_Slam I would say the bear tanks excell at holding aggro, way faster and better then other tanks.
[1:32:07] tipapou: @2woDads idk bro no world buffs
[1:32:08] hoegaardenz: ResidentSleeper
[1:32:08] inchedup: @eratrius Parsing is the best individual metric, guild metric is speed

[1:42:13] grillparty1992: @blastboys123 no its just called the undying challenge. its a speedrun contest. these are 2 speedrun guilds, its depends who is faster and every death gives a penalty
[1:42:14] flammarofl: so what happens if some1 dies? do they get to make a new character or is the entire challange over?

[1:42:50] Davethecave: @P_and_A because its fun?
[1:42:54] dominator051: @hotdudeswag Those numbers are arbitrary and are baseless. RNG does play a role but they all started with gear that could complete the raid
[1:42:56] AzumaaKazuma: ripper to nexus
[1:42:58] ollipopped: they probably have 5 wormholes
[1:43:06] blastboys123: u know i have a hard time finding the rules section in the !info thing
[1:43:08] PexaU: The name of the event is very confusing; it is called Undying but has nothing to do with the Undying achievement in-game. It's a Naxxramas race
[1:43:08] QQisLIVE: If they have Wormhole it isn't a problem. Whole group can use it.

[2:56:22] ModeraYsera: Undying doesnt count for the dungeons in which theyare just farming gear, its a raid achieve
[2:56:24] DreamK33PeR: @kreavesy It only counts in Naxx 10 not for dungeons
[2:56:26] phendrana1: can they share BoE between groups? or is it locked to the groups running the dungeon

[3:13:22] neezon: @gommerstrike I don't disagree, but it might just be a clarity issue. They essentially just said that "the quests" give that much, imo

[3:15:17] CrixVibez: @mordekaizer98 Incorrect. Phase 1 raids are just as easy as they were in TBC. TBC was easier IMO actually
[3:15:20] iVonshizle: @gommerstrike 10k is not gold capped

[3:16:10] neezon: @Frozenhorror About 4k is a far more accurate figure for questing 70-80 without rested/heirlooms.

[3:17:35] deadcell78: Only reason things were considered difficult back then. Everyone was learning the raids evolving new strats. There wasn't all the knowledge that's available now. Now it's all just a faceroll
[3:17:39] iVonshizle: @Frozenhorror lol i did yo just quest and pick the most expensive quest reward and sell it
[3:17:41] Scuffbeard: gold cap is over 200k, there are people on fresh with over 100k gold right now
[3:17:44] gommerstrike: @neezon if one were to just calculate and add up all the gold from the minimum number of quests needed to hit 80 from 70. That adds up much closer to your figure than this magical 10k
[3:17:56] iVonshizle: @Frozenhorror its not hard
[3:18:00] Chompsy: If you do Borean/Howling first then the other zones you end up 80 with more quests left to get max gold from
[3:18:56] gommerstrike: @Scuffbeard gold cap was attained within first few days of fresh, I mean video game wealth is meaningless
