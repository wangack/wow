[0:29:01] SweatyDaniels: would be cool if pres had a pvp talent that turned tail swipe into a leg sweep
[0:29:30] wEiRdO_dUdE: nooooooooooo

[0:31:36] Necrolancer47: dang this is a long shuffle
[0:31:43] SweatyDaniels: at least the drunk guy has limited entertainment value
[0:32:11] Somanie: @xaryuisweak ofc a community backs the streamer when you're being a fucking walnut
[0:32:11] Moobot: YouTube channel: youtube.com/venruki * Subscribe for new content!
[0:32:13] primejusticegaming: yooo what up ven
[0:32:31] wEiRdO_dUdE: -45 rating, that shaman ate our lunch!

[0:32:37] primejusticegaming: bro, i leveld a Fistweaver cause you said it was WW iwth instant solo que
[0:32:44] primejusticegaming: boy oh boy, its HILARIOUS
[0:33:03] shameshady: did you do the prediction yet @venruki
[0:33:07] Roine: @venruki what are your predictions for the weekend?
[0:33:10] Somanie: @imhyyding ok :) KEKW
[0:33:32] xxxrated: prediction dh’s everywhere!
[0:33:39] wEiRdO_dUdE: This weekend is going to be huge, I love the AWC action
[0:33:42] imhyyding: @Somanie wasnt talking to you i was talking to the xaury troll
[0:34:04] CabinetMistake: oh yeah did he do awc predictions i missed it
[0:34:08] Somanie: ahh okok lol
[0:34:11] scandza_91: Cant wait for AWC gonna be good :)
[0:34:14] shameshady: it was interesting watching Max video about the hero talents after watching your video on it .. kind of highlight the insane challange developers have when it comes to "pleasing" PVE and PVP at the same time
[0:34:22] wEiRdO_dUdE: The gauntlet is soooooo brutal
[0:34:43] goesidd: eu is stacked when swapxy is 8th
[0:34:48] okayfood: I thought the awc just ended
[0:34:55] heymomimonttv: ah jeez he doubled down
[0:34:57] goesidd: @xaryuisweak now ur reaching
[0:35:00] CabinetMistake: if i check yesterdays vod for predictions and they aren't there i will....do nothing
[0:35:10] wEiRdO_dUdE: I don't think the hero talents are a big deal. They just add some flavor/class fantasy
[0:35:11] Somanie: asking a streamer abt turning off a music on their stream can def be seen as a little rude though
[0:35:11] shameshady: He loved most of them.. only thing he hated was the Trickster, that he felt was useless... you described it as very strong :)
[0:35:28] goesidd: dont ban him, kinda see what other insane shit he says
[0:35:30] Falcanus: ban em, sterge was having the same convo with him yesterday, hes not worth it
[0:35:32] Somanie: if you don't like the music, there are streamers that don't play music yk
[0:35:37] figurines: Is there a way to turn up the music? ;)
[0:35:52] heymomimonttv: @Somanie can even just hit the mute button and play your own music! lol
[0:35:59] figurines: You should react to Max's video but from a PvP perspective
[0:36:03] 2prac: rogue is a pvp class
[0:36:08] Somanie: not saying you AREN'T welcome here, but you can't complain abt something you're just chilling in here listening to
[0:36:20] 2prac: yes there is
[0:36:20] iLLwiLL_HS: i feel like devs think there are pvp classes
[0:36:26] Roine: o dont think ive heard anyone say they like the look of rotational feint?
[0:36:29] heymomimonttv: i ask sterge every day if he watched zoolander yet, and he never gets annoyed with me. you gotta try reallllll hard to piss of the sterge
[0:36:30] imhyyding: why dont you play the sod version of wow?
[0:36:37] SweatyDaniels: if xaryu is so weak how come he eats so many bananas
[0:36:42] SweatyDaniels: seems counterintuitive
[0:36:45] Falcanus: sterge unbanned him yesterday and gave him the speech
[0:36:53] xxxrated: sis
[0:36:53] Necrolancer47: lmao
[0:36:59] Somanie: "you tryna get beat up my g" KEKW
[0:37:02] iLLwiLL_HS: if xaryu is so weak how come he does all those workouts in the closet
[0:37:07] dmicrl: lmao wtf

[1:19:38] heyweguccinow: @badasti I have the same here from EU but I gotta give it to pikaboo. Also whazz lost a bit of my respect coz he was a bit too toxic after the loss like really toxic
[1:19:42] Lurn: 😳 @absterge
[1:19:54] zerx_gg: pikaboo wont notice doesnt have addons telling him hes lagging
[1:19:59] Badasti: why does  it feel like TM always end up playing the finalist teams in like the first or second round
[1:20:21] Aimed57: The move in 3

[1:21:35] Magottx: on rogue too will be more rough than others i feel liek
[1:21:36] Dwilk20: If The Move is playing at 100% their RPS is the best comp and its scary
[1:21:38] Luigicamp: $100 on Chibaku, just cause the odds pay more
[1:21:56] Badasti: Liquid... but I want TM to win
[1:21:59] Aimed57: mesLiquid

[1:56:57] nvees: LFG is also fine until 20 keys
[1:57:15] Grimm303: you start figuring out how to pug in lfg, even 25s are fine
[1:57:18] nvees: but until then you can create your own community
[1:57:35] cerealzy: above 20 it gets harder to pug, until then its uber fine
[1:57:38] virro0: Thanks for being nice, boys! I think I will give it a shot tomorrow FeelsGoodMan
[1:57:50] jontepman: difference in shuffle and m+ is the dps never use defensives at all ever in m+ and in shuffle they sometimes just forget they exist

[2:31:56] SAND3LZ: To top it of they are banning people over chats but not banning people over using kick bots LOL
[2:32:23] heymomimonttv: @SAND3LZ dog you can have banter you just cant be overly toxic is all, which is a big problem with the internet today. they do ban kick bot users, it was a big deal last season if you missed it.

[2:41:39] heymomimonttv: @SAND3LZ nah, most of the people crying they did nothing wrong and were spam reported/banned are the more toxic players that think they're free to say whatever they want and ruin other people experiences. be polite and cordial and you're fine, and even banter is allowed so long as you dont go too far
[2:42:20] Jayisch: @panjack13 glyph to make dire beast pets same as your stable pets

Do you think i should take a break from it and keep trying  ? i've been playing sp for a bit on the side and am rly enjoying it as an alt. so i was thinking about pushing that. Curious to hear your thoughts. Much love and thank you for everything u do in the wow community.

[3:26:48] walokki: Frostbomb geting dispelled should give flurry prock + 2x icelance
[3:27:37] frost4mournee: @morrs I guess it have been cyka and blyad literally
[3:28:01] CatnipEvergreen: is fire really that bad right now? I have not seen any fire mages in pvp
[3:28:09] Crwxxx: @zerx_gg so my standard arena  frames doesnt have trinket or castbars... what lol
[3:28:09] morrs: I think frost mages seem dead by the stats I see from these arenas. Correct me if I am wrong but it seems that the thing that can deal the most consistent dmg in this meta wins.
[3:28:51] morrs: @frost4mournee I have nothing against them since now I am grown up but it was bizzare. And I dont blame them - in any pvp there is tons of swears xD
[3:29:00] Ebonborn: !sens
[3:29:13] frost4mournee: @morrs ahahaha ik
[3:29:53] SteLawBro: I can make any russian fight me....Vodka is not a food group.
[3:29:55] legiontheworgen: @walokki what's whack is frost bomb when dispelled already gives brain freeze (flurry proc)
[3:30:03] hxllxwgrave: can you play this season as frost without glacial spike, or is it too much of a detriment because of the tier set?
[3:30:03] CatnipEvergreen: !addons
[3:30:03] Moobot: @CatnipEvergreen Details, SArena, Omnibar, OmniCD, Big Debuffs, Weak Auras, RaiderIO addon
[3:30:14] frost4mournee: @morrs Russians are most toxic players in any games, I told u as Russian but I’m very quiet and don’t like to swear
[3:31:06] morrs: @frost4mournee Most of you are extremely good in RTS games :D
[3:31:11] CatnipEvergreen: @frost4mournee how hard would Russian be to learn as an English speaker?
[3:31:18] theskaaaal: talents
[3:31:53] frost4mournee: @catnipevergreen if you have a desire you can learn it very fast
[3:31:56] morrs: @CatnipEvergreen if you can learn German you are definitely capable of learning Russian :)
[3:32:20] CatnipEvergreen: @morrs I’d like to learn both to be honest, both are fun languages
[3:32:22] frost4mournee: @catnipevergreen but I’m keep learning your language is perfect for me
[3:32:56] frost4mournee: @catnipevergreen he is beautiful and international btw so
[3:33:01] CatnipEvergreen: @frost4mournee English is very tough to learn because of how many rules and exceptions we have, but I hope you have fun learning it!

[3:36:45] frost4mournee: @catnipevergreen honestly for Russians very hard to get knowledges about English language
[3:37:23] CatnipEvergreen: @frost4mournee yeah, phrasing in English is difficult to learn for non-native speakers
[3:37:29] R1klus: Which mage spec would you recommend for someone wanting to do his first climb to 1800 in 3s playing with rsham and demo?
[3:37:31] CatnipEvergreen: and tenses are difficult
[3:37:39] frost4mournee: ye
[3:37:54] frost4mournee: but I try to understanding this
[3:37:58] CatnipEvergreen: is fire even viable right now?
[3:38:31] CatnipEvergreen: @frost4mournee once you get the basics down, it’s fairly easy to learn from there :)
[3:38:48] jherrera154: Fire is always good with a sub rogue, even if fire isn't quite meta
[3:39:03] frost4mournee: ye i hope ☺️
[3:39:38] CatnipEvergreen: @frost4mournee lots of people will be rude to you for bad English, just don’t let them upset you and remember you’re in a journey :)

[4:06:58] dvoraklol: how would he be at that rating then?
[4:07:09] Slayer_Eagleone: venruki and you know all the dps are rage whispering that priest on top of that LMAO
[4:07:10] morrs: on paper if you go on sham: 1st you force him to use heal himself and he wont be able to keep up without casting, 2nd - you prevent him from casting where his Mastery heals are really strong. Anyhow these games are high rated so probably they have their own reasons
