[0:51:19] MorePudding: This guy literally messaged me saying he got his whole guild to report me... all they would need to do is read the chat log and they would see that.
[0:51:28] QuestFor420: twitter with screen shots is the most effective pudding
[0:51:30] xYourDemise: Tell theres something wrong with your payment method
[0:51:33] MorePudding: Thanks mate. Yeah such pricks.
[0:51:36] feelinchrisp: did you screenshot the logs and send it in
[0:51:43] Aeycka__: @NooleanB xD
[0:51:43] MorePudding: @QuestFor420 I don't have screenshots unfortunately :( I wish i did.
[0:51:50] ScryerTV: @xYourDemise xd

[0:54:46] beelklampton: event has been nerfed a  lot
[0:54:54] Scardi06: KEKW
[0:55:03] Curlypasta: @beelklampton how so?
[0:55:04] MorePudding: It's just frustrating because all they need is for there to be a script that checks the chat log and see if any bad language or abusive language was used, and if it wasn't then it's probably a fake report. But they don't even do that. Just annoying. Have had the account since 2007 and now missing out on raiding with my guild in SOD.
[0:55:35] EmanuShow: Btw matt do not accept free gold from anyone
[0:55:40] MajesticAFx: @MorePudding feelsbadman
[0:55:48] beelklampton: @beelklampton debuff is somehow staying longer
[0:55:54] EmanuShow: Do not even open unkown trades

[0:56:29] dj_clerik: yeah 20s silence tilting as fuck
[0:56:31] QuestFor420: pudding it might not be in your wheelhouse but having a second account in todays age isnt a bad thing giving you ahve the time
[0:56:33] beelklampton: toi avoid spawn camping
[0:56:42] beelklampton: to*
[0:56:54] KietzTV: hunter traps earthbind totems
[0:57:02] KietzTV: i guess
[0:57:13] MorePudding: @QuestFor420 Yeah probably not the worst idea but two subs is a bit shit. PRetty much only playing SOD these days.
[0:57:16] beelklampton: nah it's a good fix
[0:57:30] TheSanguist: Does Meta PVP feel more reliable for you?
[0:57:42] beelklampton: people just grief otherwise

[1:02:32] coolcrazyguy72: the sol foundation uploaded a bunch of videos on YouTube
[1:02:35] TheSanguist: Your group is not a group though.  Especially if they want to 1v5 everything
[1:02:36] beelklampton: somehow
[1:03:09] Saveth_: @Toolt holy shit 35% pretty big
[1:03:17] maxiliboys: 2hat genre you got from your last raid?

[1:04:29] Aeycka__: sounds like Classic WoW PvP allright
[1:04:29] Toolt: @Toolt thats because, Starsurge now provides a new effect: your next Starfire cast within 15 seconds deals 66% increased damage.. So stop the 2nd
[1:04:30] NooleanB: White is black.  Good is bad.  Up is Down.
[1:04:30] Arcsilin: star surge has only gotten a 33% nerf not 35%

[1:07:02] Dillsmof: did you do gnomer this lock out dawg?
[1:07:03] tat_urfa: maybe the play would be soul link, fellhunter and meta due to so many casters? your damage potential is very low anyways but your survivability would highly increase

[2:47:21] AlphaSimply: Russia was a big help for us in the war
[2:47:30] spoontoobig: i though this will be propaganda stream, but so far so good @StaysafeTV  :d
[2:47:31] Bacca_gunta: didnt putin in this interview basically say poland is at fault for germans invading them ?

[2:48:59] WeeNeeber: He is saying Ukraine is a fabrication even the language and from their perspective shouldn't exist
[2:49:17] buckoka: @vapenation_gg And Russia defines good relations at will
[2:49:28] FranklyFranklin: Lots of unknown reasons
[2:49:31] Bacca_gunta: this is how we argue in the balkans when talking about historical claims

[2:56:19] macheight: @siremethyr Yep, it's called deterrent
[2:56:21] Durlog: Why didnt Biden start a career in mumble rap?
[2:56:25] andyjamesgames: @winehouse_id do you think the White House facilitated this interview between Tucker and Putin?

[2:57:03] shiggydoo43: @Pantelijus you mean all the crazy militias killing each other in ukraine ? is that in your mind russia being attacked?
[2:57:05] Razaco_: nah I‚Äôd win
[2:57:12] dumani542: to be fair, as a european, i do not understand why we have pushed russia to the side for so  long...i cannot imagine europe without russia

[2:58:32] omarali118: If the West had been more aggressive, Russia would've tried to force the Warsaw pact nations back into the fold by force. I think that's what he means
[2:58:53] Metaphix: its also explicitly a defensive alliance only
[2:58:56] BrutalTrue: @shiggydoo43 they did not took nothing, there was already Russian military because different safe reasons.

[2:59:11] omarali118: @Metaphix Nato has never fought a defensive war, only aggressive ones, in it's entire history.
[2:59:12] shiggydoo43: @StaysafeTV russia signed as part of UN powers the treaty that any country (example poland) can have whatever alliance they want and borders dont change by force

[2:59:49] Pureblue: Russia themselves are doing exactly that.
[2:59:51] EmanuShow: But russia wont use large scale nukes
[3:00:00] macheight: Putin was stationed in East Germany at the time and has stated that the collapse of the Soviet empire ‚Äúwas the greatest geopolitical catastrophe of the century‚Äù there is a lot of copium here
[3:00:03] shiggydoo43: @BrutalTrue crimeea was ukraine and russia had naval base deal there with ukraine, why are you trying to debate basic history? russia took all of crimeea
[3:00:04] forsale1312: it's all an act lol biden and putin are in this war together

[3:00:25] sh1nyher0: the minute that the news hit that russia invaded ukraine couple years ago it flipped a switch and neighboring countries had to join nato for self defence
[3:00:27] Metaphix: @Pantelijus NATO did not attack Iraq.

[3:01:17] L12ard_k1ng: do you think US should weaken relationship with NATO @StaysafeTV ?
[3:01:18] shiggydoo43: @StaysafeTV do you UNDERSTAND the history of why people in eastern europe want to apply for NATO? prague spring and other russian violent interventions, deporting of people and bringing in russians in finland, moldova etc.
[3:01:26] Metaphix: @Pantelijus i used to be in the military. I got a NATO award for afghanistan and was a part of NATO ISAF forces but not in Iraq, Iraq I was just a US soldier
[3:01:28] cheburrator44: It is totally fair to mention the agreement to not expand NATO past east Berlin, but very few people are willing to talk about the agreement between Ukraine, USA and Russia calling for Ukraine to retain its territorial integrity in exchange for giving up the nuclear weapons, clearly this agreement was not upheld in 2014
[3:01:29] Nero_RME: a lot of money in those US bases in EU

[3:01:43] PieceOfPanic: @StaysafeTV To be fair, in reality. US would want a functioning Europe to work together with AGAINST asia and russia.
[3:01:46] omarali118: @StaysafeTV Smart take, I never thought of that. That probably explains why the USA doesn't care that much that Europe doesn't pay their share for NATO

[3:02:21] porkoltszaft: @StaysafeTV @cheburrator44 is right, Russia violated the Budapest memorandum

[3:49:05] mrmangasm: Russia needs the ocean port right?
[3:49:12] Pureblue: Russia wouldn't have invaded if Budapest Memorandum 1994 never happened and Ukraine got to keep its nuclear weapons
[3:49:14] mrmangasm: I thought that was a key issue for them
[3:49:22] buckoka: @fietsopa4 Agression is not unique for Russia. What's more unique is the governing traditions of eastern empires
[3:49:23] Phalloides60: @mrmangasm yes
[3:49:24] sigilfish: @mrmangasm yeah, that's why they wanted finland back in the day
[3:49:26] shiggydoo43: its literally about the 2 different systems democracy or autocracy, all this history bullshit aside and real ties between ukrainians and russians, this is why putin planned war since 2014

[3:51:01] freelootenthousiast: as a european and at the risk of getting banned for my ignorance in asking this, i need to ask, why does it appear a sizeable amount of american republicans seem to think favorable of putin ? do they aspire to live under a authoritarian dictator aswell instead of a democracy?

[4:12:02] CouldBeOldBumpi: Im not pro anyone and know to little to actually agree with anything. I think the de nazification is the wrong term. He thinks of another similar movement to build and end up going to war etc. Stopping harmful ideologys before they take root properly maybe.

[4:16:57] tailormort: this happened in Slovakia recently :)
[4:17:00] ggk_54: if you break this idea into fragmentation, without the broader context, you are right.

[4:17:15] dumani542: the question is why has no one invaded north korea

[4:17:17] fn_rd: they are directly supporting far right independant militia yes ukraine directly support nazism
[4:17:24] animotion: didn‚Äôt Boris Johnson shut down the original peace talks
[4:17:36] pregnantjewhostage: ü§±
[4:17:54] reforgedx: @fn_rd what independant militia?
[4:17:55] mrmangasm: @dumani542 its too close to south Korea, and the basic estimations show that a ton of innocent people die
[4:18:05] nostalgiatrip94: Tax payer money should stay in the USA
[4:18:11] ggk_54: biden sent johnson
[4:18:12] Pureblue: I don't understand where this hatred towards Zelensky comes from in some of these self-proclaimed "patriots" in the West. It doesn't make any fucking sense. If asking for weapons and ammunition to defend your country against an armed invasion isn't patriotic, what is?
[4:18:14] buckoka: The first part of denazification has been trying to surgically take out all of Ukraine's defenses with missles then trying to take all of its land by surprise
[4:18:17] SleepyJerome: they talk about that now
[4:18:20] PondoTTV: There is no money in ending the war
[4:18:35] ToN1c: @staysafetv do you think Putin will use his nukes at some point?

[4:20:48] SlicexDH: @omarali118 I agree but using IQ as a raw metric is cringe, it doesnt directly correlate to knowledge
[4:21:03] EmanuShow: Im refering to beginning of his lecture @ToN1c and the reason for why he thinks ukraine has no own identity and now needs to be denazified

European countries should certainly pay in more but we have to remember why NATO was created. To keep Europe united and prevent another world war.

[5:07:47] selmoTV: neuralink
[5:07:48] darkbull36: His brain is stuck in 1970 though
[5:07:50] Nerzz: Since when there is even a question about agreeing or disagriing putin?
[5:07:51] robeson10: @freefiremafia 99.99% of people want Putin as their president not Alzheimer or a puppet

[5:07:55] Arawnik: it's because these discussions only come from heavily regulated setups with alot of prep work
[5:07:59] DefaTL: @StaysafeTV the sad part is the people making fun of putin when he gives u a history lesson, learn something bro dont laugh at history
[5:08:00] Aeycka__: @sigilfish can you whisper me one URL please?

[5:08:34] chamlet2764: July 4th 1776

[5:08:54] zebulous: He said he cant remember when he talked to zelenski last
[5:08:57] asdft90: Without Ukraine, Russia's history starts in 14th century, not thousands of years as they claim. That's the reason they're so obsessed with Ukraine
[5:09:01] freefiremafia: He mixed up half of what he said. You just won't check.
[5:09:08] antilifeshell: he is to history what asmongold is to wow
[5:09:09] MoreDakka: @biigredant yea who cares, "time started when i woke up this morning and my morality is shaped as such" StopChamp
[5:09:10] hathor488: His whole schtick is to recontextualize the war as a natural part of history
[5:09:16] SlicexDH: He obviously prepped heavily for this interview to be fair @StaysafeTV
[5:09:18] fastest2synapses: need more drunk uncles giving the when you come over to the autistic oomfie‚Äôs place and they pull out the fnaf lore folder times
[5:09:20] greaser6996: even if it is scripted, give Biden a scripted interview and see how long it would take to fall apart

[5:11:41] fuguelah: He is faking being religious
[5:11:42] WhaleBlast: i found it hilarious this bozo didnt talk about the oil that was foudn in Ukraine in 2012-13. The fact that Hunter worked for an energy company in Ukraine, the rights Shell and other companies were given to those fields and the economic impact that 400b worth of natural gas would have had on the Russian economy. Other than this, Ukraine had the position to become the Netherlands of the east.
[5:11:43] freefiremafia: not true)) we think about food more and more)
[5:11:49] MyDeal: Dostoyevsky's work is like 90% critique of Russian society KEKW
[5:11:54] MoreDakka: translations from russian to english never seem to get the point across, you get like 75% of what the person was trying to say
[5:11:57] kalmah2112: Putin absolutely fucked what could have been a great country.

[5:12:35] fastest2synapses: yes
[5:12:35] fuguelah: calling him for being a fake christian
[5:12:35] WhaleBlast: well Putin's people are christians
[5:12:36] BrutalTrue: peace is the goal!
[5:12:37] drisan87: yes
[5:12:37] hathor488: Because he's a right wing hack
[5:12:38] 9Augustus9: Turn the other cheek
[5:12:39] uzvardrinks: yes
[5:12:39] ChillyHTX: making it relatable to western audiences?
[5:12:40] Vindorin: @SlicexDH ill look into that, thank you
[5:12:41] zVaall: the were not so different thing
[5:12:44] 3verythingatonce: hes vilianizing putin
[5:12:46] selmoTV: ya
[5:12:47] omarali118: Religion is a big part of the war, Zelenskyy banned the church in Ukraine because they supported Ruddia
[5:12:48] dogo_person: LOL
[5:12:48] Knaldstiv: maybe both
[5:12:48] zebulous: Cause its interesting
[5:12:50] selmoTV: that
[5:12:50] myodoctor: what‚Äôs the consensus of the people constantly commenting on tuckers face? is it truly disgusting? or would it be some sort of projection of different feelings? 1. they‚Äôre ugly themselves. 2. they hate what he stands for and have no other rebuttal.
[5:12:51] ticeyx: both
[5:12:55] commanderplungus: Definitely not the 3rd :)
[5:12:57] soVerynano: putin has tried to profile himself as very religious the past 10-20 years.
[5:12:58] hathor488: HAH
[5:13:00] Shocklate_: probably all of the above
[5:13:00] MoreDakka: tucker has said that he's religious
[5:13:01] DemonicAvatar: @DrDeath30 he speaks german and he can speak english but a good translator is better in this case
[5:13:02] tuster12: hes trying to pin the russian people against him
[5:13:05] ggk_54: tucker gave an answer, why he interviewed it this way, it was very intereting
[5:13:07] DefaTL: hes episopalian
[5:13:09] biZZonu: this interview was made for u muricans to for comming elections
[5:13:10] DougMaisner: putin war ideology is partly about protecting russia trad society against western degen culture
[5:13:10] cazacuradu: tries to make him look religiously insane..
[5:13:18] RueRunsIt: ticker is paid opposition
[5:13:19] fastest2synapses: idk if the schwann heir is deeply christian
[5:13:20] WhaleBlast: That said, Gorbachov the drunkard would have saved us a lot of trouble if he had kept the parts of east ukraine that have ethnic russians living in them like donbass, crimea and that other place.
[5:13:24] SlicexDH: I don't think Tucker is extremely religious himself
[5:13:29] Lirrok: maybe just wants to understand Putin's way of thinking and see how much Christianity influences it
[5:13:32] selmoTV: he is aiming for what putins values are
[5:13:33] freefiremafia: Tucker tried to help Putin make him look like a religious guy, but Putin did not understand this pitch and could not respond.
[5:13:43] biZZonu: i AM EU citizen i have border with Ukraine, come here and see what war means
[5:13:45] hydrobeam_: i believe its 2 and 3. I believe Tucker is Christian and I believe he is trying to have Putin self reflect based on what he has said so far
[5:13:49] kelvystorm: for the horde!!!
[5:13:50] HeIlraiser_: fellow media spy release
[5:13:52] kalmah2112: Tucker knows is audience.

[5:24:50] 13deadace1: @spookystylo ay yo
[5:24:54] EffinsTV: Of course he's not gonna speak a different language than his native language. He did not look up to this interview, Tucker was and he agreed. Moreso, even if his English is fluent, why risk mumbling any word or getting laughed at for weird pronunciation. Makes no sense.
[5:24:56] WhaleBlast: I think it's hilarious that the west has chosen to go to war instead of just dropping a bomb in threat. The current method of warfare being utilized in Ukraine is solely made for the military industrial complex to profit. There were other means to reel in Russia like solving the Turkey Cyprus conflict allowing for gas to come from this region which holds enough to keep us warm for decades.

[5:38:52] PeasantNoMore: @MyDeal Without the special operation the ukraine would've installed nato bases @uzvardrinks I'm sorry for that, in the war only the people suffer and they are not the ones choosing political decisions of countries
[5:38:53] reforgedx: @qcchuckecheeze link source then please
[5:38:55] ufox1: yet US Senate passes critical $95 billion foreign aid bill

[5:39:25] morfius09: tucker CIA network
[5:39:27] PieceOfPanic: @sweetleaf_ Then there'd be no buffer zone between nato and Russia.
[5:39:31] Frank4LuLz: I AM NO LONGER A COMMIE HATER
[5:39:34] Wildsmasher: he was not at all
[5:39:40] MyDeal: @PeasantNoMore all Putin accomplished was galvanizing NATO unity and support re: Russia agression :D
[5:39:40] bongbuilder7589: I‚Äôm old enough and I remember the coup in Ukraine. It was on CNN for days

[5:39:47] SpunZ_TV: was a solid interview, entertaining
[5:39:49] xXtroggerzXx: Yeah I dont know where that narritive came from. Tucker pushed him fairly on a few questions.
[5:39:50] WhaleBlast: I have to say this made Hasanabi sound a lot more intelligent monkaHmm
[5:39:52] zebulous: Anyone who says that is clearly just propagandizing
[5:39:52] eggandsill: I thought he did alright
[5:39:52] fastest2synapses: I think the Varangian history lesson for hours + CIA reject diss dialed any chance of that back quite a bit
[5:39:54] pappej: it was good
[5:39:57] seksiman194: Tucker prolly had a good team in his ear
[5:40:07] MyDeal: you need to watch some real journalists conduct interviews next :D maybe try BBC

[5:40:23] EmanuShow: I think tucker took the neutral journalist role
[5:40:23] PieceOfPanic: Circumstances taken into account, I think he did the best anyone could ask.
[5:40:25] MyDeal: felt like Carlson was attending a lecture not interviewing
[5:40:25] drakkir: putins nazi argurments were so bad
[5:40:26] SlicexDH: @moshstur and then we would be as bad as dictatorship lol - the irony
