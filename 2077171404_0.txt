[2:35:28] Spyke_ZGZ: Yo do BMWs just not come with turn signals?
[2:35:31] aginsb: if you look at the rewards, the amount of stability you get is based on how far away from the center you are
[2:35:31] Spyke_ZGZ: I swear to fuck lmfao
[2:35:41] drewbullx: @Spyke_ZGZ correct
[2:35:42] aginsb: so the most efficient path is a single straight line out
[2:35:59] whodoes__that: I like runes and glyphs for crafting, or item types you need
[2:36:15] whodoes__that: then you can find uniques/sets rewards
[2:36:24] aginsb: yeah, I tend to do that while making some small adjustments if theres a node I want
[2:36:24] Spyke_ZGZ: @drewbullx Was behind one the entire 10 minute drive home right now

[2:57:03] Wombatt_ZGZ: that's all we need, babyt
[2:57:08] drewbullx: ahhhhh
[2:57:17] Spyke_ZGZ: UNLESS you have Prime Video

[3:06:18] Tinit5190: Really?
[3:06:19] Tinit5190: wtf
[3:06:31] drewbullx: let's just cut a bigger hole in your wall

[3:07:19] Tinit5190: @SavedEight_ZGZ Excuse me, we are talking in celsius here.

[3:09:58] SavedEight_ZGZ: "this house is only hot enough for the one of us"
[3:10:09] whodoes__that: !TOS

[3:10:39] Wombatt_ZGZ: have her work outside
[3:10:56] SavedEight_ZGZ: tell her to tell her work that she knows a guy with some corsair connections
[3:10:58] Tinit5190: Someone needs to go to ikea and build her a soundproof room and ask her how the heat feels.
[3:11:15] drewbullx: we can build you a streamer shed
[3:11:36] Tinit5190: That's probably risky in calgary
[3:11:39] SavedEight_ZGZ: 4090
[3:11:40] Wombatt_ZGZ: @Tinit5190 house isn't big enough for more soundwaves
[3:11:44] SavedEight_ZGZ: :D
[3:11:54] drewbullx: oh it doesn't need to be warm enough, all you do is complain about how hot it is
[3:11:55] SavedEight_ZGZ: in the winter time you just game harder, simple
[3:11:58] drewbullx: so no issue there EZ
[3:12:18] ARobotVampire: Just mine crypto while gaming
[3:12:18] Wombatt_ZGZ: You need to look into getting AC added to your existing forced air system.  You can close off vents in rooms that don't need the extra cooling
[3:12:20] SavedEight_ZGZ: Drew came up with a great solution, nice work Drew
[3:12:26] Wombatt_ZGZ: at least get a comparative quote
[3:12:52] Wombatt_ZGZ: Yeah, and you close off vents
[3:13:15] ARobotVampire: is a floor unit not enough to keep up with the heat?
[3:13:24] DoubleXL_ZgZ: i love the intro scene on the new YT vid..
[3:13:33] Broseph33: I get what he says about closing off vents. it works. that’s how we force hot air in our place to opposite ends of the house
[3:14:37] StreamElements: We're LIVE on Kick! ---> https://kick.com/zeegers/
[3:14:54] Wombatt_ZGZ: cut a couple inches off the bottom of the door
[3:15:03] Wombatt_ZGZ: the house I grew up in also had no returns
