I imagine if you turn off lighting and stuff it'd be longer.   if i had known a wireless scimitar was coming, i would've waited on the aerox tho. seems like a sweet mouse.

[2:18:47] TacDuc: @dimofodi My excuse for building a new PC, is that my PC died before this summer, and I had a lot of work this summer...
[2:19:17] Lulaboo: If you like to build your own pc you can buy a kit from corsair
[2:19:24] TheUnknowing: i built my last 2 computers before my most recent, hate building pcs. Bought my most recent one prebuilt lol
[2:19:24] Moobot:  Towelliee.com has all of your Towelliee news WoW UI addon information, and merchandise collection. Check it out!
[2:19:32] rymerre: i used to build my own but now i get pre builds and modify them later
[2:19:36] Grizzlenizzle415: I built my own most recent PC, but getting a prebuilt is likely worth the stress relief haha
[2:19:36] FalconKline: I don't like building, but I do it because I know I can and it saves $
[2:19:41] MiddleAgedDann: I bought an Origin prebuild about a month ago. Love it. It's my second Origin PC
[2:19:49] dimofodi: @TacDuc There's always a way! She actually doesn't give me trouble when I build a new one but I try to make them last at least 5 years then she gets my hand-me-down that's way too much for what she uses it for, even 5 years old. :D
[2:19:53] asmodai4823: yea around that
[2:20:00] bad_fish_too: Only difficult part of building pc's is the cable management LUL
[2:20:00] CeruleanStar: my wifes rig runs a 1080ti and she still plays most stuff np
[2:20:04] jeffstaggs: 1050ti still works just fine
[2:20:06] Mahal_11532: just over 7
[2:20:09] Cerberus_z28: 2016 i think
[2:20:17] xhold0utx: I just upgraded from a 1060 to a 3060
[2:20:18] skymercii: my new gpu is gonna be a 1660 super mainly its what i could afford rn and what my pc was compatible with
[2:20:19] skyggen1177: yo @Towelliee do we have a code for this new Corsair mouse?
[2:20:39] Kakotan2143: @Towelliee anything new about the new Scimitar?
[2:20:44] vulkankragon: @xhold0utx 12 gb or 8 gb?
[2:20:50] wdotk: @Towelliee gaming laptops are making their own thing now... msi raider  with the 4090 or the titan gt77
[2:20:51] Sollice: No codes but he may have some giveaways later in the montrh
[2:20:53] Sollice: !corsair

[2:20:54] TacDuc: I love building stuff, especially electronics, well, also going to be studying Electrical Engineering. I love working and troubleshooting for electronics, both stuff I make myself or some PC parts that have problems
[2:21:39] TacDuc: @dimofodi Yeah, same here. Also upgrade my PC every once in a while, which is every couple of years.
[2:21:45] polaropposite76: ordered the scimitar wireless yesterday afternoon and it just got here
[2:21:47] Colt_Engineer: That’s what she said
[2:21:50] skyggen1177: are the buttons more durable would you say? my left click always gets worn down fast
[2:21:56] wEiRdO_dUdE: The new Scimitar has a 26K sensor
[2:22:08] Sollice: 26k? lol
[2:22:10] Sollice: jesus
[2:22:50] skymercii: ive never used a scimitar
[2:23:06] Sollice: Most mouses used otemu switches for years
[2:23:14] wEiRdO_dUdE: The big sensors are nice for multimonitor setups and higher resolutions, but it is overkill yeah
[2:23:20] Sollice: But they are adopting more optical, magnetic or different kinds of mechanical switches
[2:23:27] Sollice: Thats my next thing building a custom mouses
[2:23:28] Knocx: i just need corsair to make like a palm rest mini keyboard like the razer one and id swap to them
[2:23:35] skymercii: i currently use a steel series wireless mouse
[2:23:36] Sollice: Its a style of switch
[2:23:42] Sollice: basic
[2:24:03] TacDuc: I use a scimitar for MMO's, and sometimes other games, but I have another mouse I use whenever I don't play MMO's. But the Scimitar is very good, and very comfortable to use
[2:25:17] herzlustafir: i like that unhealthly much.

[2:26:38] Vladeimir: magnets are magic
[2:26:40] Colt_Engineer: They have what plants crave
[2:26:49] vulkankragon: @skyggen1177 take the mouse to work?
[2:26:50] wEiRdO_dUdE: Those new magnetic switches let you tune the actuation points, which is nice
[2:27:00] skyggen1177: magnetic switches better than mechanical you think?
[2:27:28] skymercii: my mouse is steel series Aerox 5 Wireless and im loving it

[2:28:00] Sollice: Mechanical means there is an actual spring that actuates on the bottom of the pole
[2:28:01] BTiZZY_: nadeshot was talking about his new keyboard yesterday that has magnetic switches and he said it’s the greatest thing ever @towelliee
[2:28:06] wEiRdO_dUdE: THe K70 words it "Magnetic-Mechanical "
[2:28:16] Ezcotli: There are magnetic joy sticks on controllers no drift
[2:28:39] Sollice: Your going to see a lot of magnetic switches become more customizable. The top housing, the bottom housing. All of that stuff affects feeling
[2:28:46] rymerre: yeah those are Hall Effect sensor switches
[2:28:49] rymerre: no drift
[2:28:54] skymercii: i think like i have a cherry low profile switch whatever that means
[2:29:06] Sollice: They are basically going to call anything not membrane "mechanical"
[2:29:07] herzlustafir: i dont think we will land on it either.. just as robots.. i think its to far away intellegent wise
[2:29:15] skyggen1177: i want to have the same feel of mechanical switches but without all the sound

[2:30:12] wEiRdO_dUdE: Mechanical keyboards can be fairly quiet if they are "linear" ones and not "clicky"
[2:30:20] Sollice: @skyggen1177 Get silent switches
[2:30:34] Echo973: i use the K55 still and love it
[2:30:36] kcwishbone: grats
[2:30:39] Sollice: Lots of keyboard companies will have silent switch options
[2:30:56] theDirtyon3: I still love my razer black widow optical switches
[2:31:07] Sollice: That's because browns are tactile
[2:31:08] wEiRdO_dUdE: I've had a few keyboards with speed silver linear switches that were not loud
[2:31:13] Sollice: You can feel them actually activating
[2:31:22] skymercii: is black widow keyboard or mouse?
[2:31:28] orbiitz269: I use the reds, but I'll have to check out browns
[2:32:02] wEiRdO_dUdE: Reds are usually loud, but Cherry does make silent reds too, I think
[2:32:21] Sollice: @orbiitz269 Browns are tactile. That means you get more responsiveness from touch when you use them
[2:32:29] Sollice: they are clickly loud like blues
[2:32:39] MourvinMad: I've been building keyboards since then pandy wandy.  If anyone has switch questions I can help out
[2:32:49] toobaked1987: 27 OOOOOF!

[2:33:12] Sollice: @MourvinMad You ever use Neopolitan Ice Cream tactiles?
[2:33:24] skyggen1177: yea i have a Razer Ornata Chroma Keyboard and i love the feel but i hate the loud clicking. i can hear it through my headphones and my kids bedroom is next to my office so it wakes them up when i type a lot after hours
[2:33:45] Sollice: !corsair
[2:33:45] Moobot: @Sollice THE NEW WIRELESS SCIMITAR IS OUT! towLoot by CORSAIR! https://cor.sr/Towelliee |
[2:33:47] wEiRdO_dUdE: But yeah almost all keyboards will make some sound unless it's like a membrane kind that is not as responsive
[2:33:59] th3probl3m: ICUE breaks my shit so I never use it
[2:34:24] MourvinMad: @Sollice i havent but i saw them on cannonkeys recently.  You give em a shot?
[2:34:26] tomfoolery_1: I keep pushing off a new SSD, but I need one. Pain.
[2:34:27] Kakotan2143: @th3probl3m thats weird, it never does that for me
[2:34:42] Deathchampt: i download my ram
[2:34:51] Sollice: I am going to. I want to build a high end tactile. I have my Zoom75 coming..anytime now
[2:35:28] Deathchampt: synapsis is bad
[2:35:46] wEiRdO_dUdE: I've never really had a problem with ICUE either

[2:35:50] TheUnknowing: I had to revert my icue cause it wasnt letting me bind the dpi switch on my scimitar. idk if they have that fixed yet
[2:36:03] MourvinMad: The zoom looks great.  I need a board with a dial just for the memes
[2:36:11] theDirtyon3: Synapse is kinda goated these days tbh
[2:36:14] Deathchampt: bugs some games
[2:36:16] bad_fish_too: I just use Icue for my 6 LL120 fans. I've never had an issue.

[2:36:39] ashawn40: How comparable is Starfield to D2?
[2:36:43] Knocx: just started updating mine
[2:36:59] th3probl3m: ICUE now? Hmm. Interesting. ICUE makes my mouse and keyboard stutter and lag. but when I close it everything works fine  xD
[2:37:02] theDirtyon3: not at all
[2:37:10] theDirtyon3: diff types of games
[2:37:12] skymercii: diablo 2 or destiny 2
[2:37:13] Mecabeast: Both in space
[2:37:19] abracka_: pretty much the same game, bethesda copy pasted D2, stole the entire code just changed the story KEKW
[2:37:33] wEiRdO_dUdE: Yeah Destiny 2 LUL
[2:37:48] killmasa: star citizen or pacman  Kappa
[2:37:56] jaykyew: Destiny is a multiplayer looter shooter, Starfield is a single-player RPG
[2:38:07] wEiRdO_dUdE: There may be jumping puzzles in Starfield, we'll just have to see
[2:38:17] ashawn40: just an honest question no need to harsh
[2:38:30] Timothious: how is starcitizen doing now anyone here play it
[2:38:31] PLANS14: Hi towelliee is this hardcore?
[2:38:37] jaykyew: Tbh I thought they meant Diablo 2 at first LUL
[2:38:45] DaWilt: DaWilt subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 87 months! 
[2:38:56] snarkydonald: just watch the trailers? make your own comparison
[2:39:16] TacDuc: Starfield is definitely also a looter shooter, I will be looting everything atleast, and get so overencumbered that I will spend hours travelling to get back to my base where I can put all the junk I just looted
[2:39:20] wEiRdO_dUdE: In the official gameplay stuff I saw, the one dev guy was jumping around and shooting like they do in Destiny 2, but there are alternative play styles with melee weapons
[2:39:38] vulkankragon: i think the biggest failure of diablo 4 is limiting the campaign to level 50
[2:39:42] th3probl3m: th3probl3m subscribed with Prime. 
[2:39:46] Nokterian: Star Citizen is still in alpha for nearly 13 years rooSuffer

[2:42:16] wEiRdO_dUdE: Tom's Hardware just put out a review for the new Corsair Scimitar Elite wireless mouse, this morning
[2:42:56] jaykyew: @TacDuc Looter shooter doesn't just mean "any game where you shoot and also loot things". It's a specific genre of games like Destiny or Borderlands that revolve around a gear grind. Starfield isn't that

[2:44:30] vulkankragon: new world is fundamentally flawed. no matter what they do they will never get back even 100k players.
[2:44:33] jaykyew: I got back into NW briefly around the new season and the level grind is better but it still just feels kind empty to me
[2:44:45] Colt_Engineer: Mine? Mine?Mine? Mine?Mine? Mine?Mine? Mine?Mine? Mine?Mine? Mine?Mine? Mine?Mine? Mine?Mine? Mine?Mine? Mine?Mine? Mine?
[2:44:45] jaykyew: And apparently the endgame sucks
[2:45:14] Meliea_EU: dont know why i still got NW installed, there is hope i like it one day
[2:45:49] jaykyew: But it's just chest runs and running like 8 dungeons. That's nothing compared to most MMOs
[2:45:51] bypized: Can it be tomorrow already?
[2:45:54] IgneousLion: there is dungeon finder
[2:46:07] DunzoCD: honestly with them removing ward from the game you dont have to have 5 different gearsets just to get into dungeons, which is great for new players
[2:46:09] Meliea_EU: wow is on a new low, did not even log in for the reset, need something new there

[2:48:36] Knocx: ok that new world expac trailer was fire
[2:48:37] Mecabeast: Why do the dwarves always be yelling lol
[2:48:39] jaykyew: @IgneousLion I agree with that, for $40 I've definitely gotten my money's worth. Just not something I care to keep up with long term
[2:48:40] Nokterian: Dwarfs screming in your face
[2:48:42] Knocx: might get back into it then
[2:48:51] IgneousLion: if that was true stuff like Ascension wouldnt be as popular as it is
[2:48:54] Meliea_EU: im rather temped to play some gw2
[2:48:59] killmasa: PvP players quit the game,Pve players have better mmorpg to play pve...so if they sticked to pvpatleast one playerbase had something to play lol
[2:49:00] vulkankragon: some ppl still don't understand that players that are interested in pvp play battle royales, mobas and shooters, not mmorpgs
[2:49:11] Timothious: shooting all them cannons and guns makes them hard of hearing lol
[2:49:37] veryhairyheyyall: "keeP YOUR feet on THE GROUND" towRage towHAMUP

[2:50:56] CousinAvi86: either toxic AF or exploit/hack and ruin the experience and people quit
[2:50:59] floatinging: PvP in MMOs was only popular outside of truly competitive players when people found gearing advantages to farm kills
[2:51:06] jaykyew: All 6 PvP players are mad online LUL
[2:51:22] floatinging: Competitive (fair) PVP is only for players who actually like the challenge, not being overpowered.
[2:51:37] IgneousLion: Mor e games need to adopt the pvp model that Ascension does the option of no risk to high risk being an option makes it good
[2:51:48] wEiRdO_dUdE: They were awful with lagging each other out LUL

[2:52:43] shortyforthewin: nasty hurricanes going in on usa  and 2 of em
[2:52:54] mavericks312: If you ain’t cheatin you ain’t winnin
[2:53:00] wEiRdO_dUdE: Another awful thing was that those "hardcore" PvP people were RMTing like hell to buy BiS  gear for an advantage
[2:53:07] Cicvara1: be honest, have you ever cheated or came close to cheating in an online game that you've played in the past? @Towelliee
[2:53:09] floatinging: @Towelliee exactly, that's what most people find fun about PVP not the challenge games try to make PVP
[2:53:35] Tooyoo: the big lure about PvP MMOs is that it is easy to develop

[2:53:52] MourvinMad: anyone who played vanilla on pvp servers knows exactly how that went for new players
[2:53:55] Tebatusasula42069: @Towelliee i've never understood people who kill low level players

[2:54:15] dimofodi: I've "exploited" vents in MW2 that would shoot you high in the air and let you get out of the map. I did it to explore though. Never killed anyone using it.
[2:54:30] killmasa: ever Kappa
[2:54:30] Meliea_EU: is towelliee playing early access starfield too?
[2:54:30] darkrowse21: people were cheating in FFXIV
[2:54:41] Mecabeast: Apparently wow had some banwaves from people using rotation helpers to get good parses
[2:55:17] SouvlakiTheBest: by doing rmt, or by using hacks, or exploiting game. just off of my head (and all can be in pve mind you).
[2:55:23] abracka_: the rotation thing was automating their gameplay with 3rd party software
[2:55:29] Rottencoarse: @Towelliee  Fleks from echo got banned due to that i believe XD

[3:10:08] DunzoCD: thats a W change, it was so annoying getting all the bane armor

[3:11:08] herzlustafir: power?
[3:11:08] wEiRdO_dUdE: We just know a max of item level 700, probably some way to upgrade some gear to that

[3:12:05] Nuclearthyme: people would run m10 dungeons and sell the 6k shards by leaving the dungeon for the buyer
[3:12:35] Molvonos: @Sollice Honestly, I doubt they will.  They seem to have this hardon for 'finesse' style

[3:13:08] DunzoCD: @Sollice They teased daggers beofre launch but who knows if we will ever see them
[3:13:13] theDirtyon3: yea
[3:13:24] wEiRdO_dUdE: If you already own the base game then the expansion is $29.99
[3:13:35] Nuclearthyme: And youll want to buy the season pass for another 20.
[3:13:38] theDirtyon3: but if I dont... its $70
[3:13:44] theDirtyon3: super steep for new players
[3:13:45] Dragonslay1: Dragonslay1 subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 57 months! 
[3:13:55] wEiRdO_dUdE: Yeah they sold a few million copies
[3:14:19] maustercheese: it was a LOT initially for the launch
[3:14:35] LearnedSomething: it's a buy to play game, with time saving xp boosters in the cash shop
[3:14:37] maustercheese: so yeah if they can get even a fraction of those ppl to come back

[3:15:02] Clay2K_: big dick hammer icon finally
[3:15:10] theDirtyon3: they are trying to charge WoW expac prices for a inferior game. Not trying to be rude just speaking truths
[3:15:29] maustercheese: i would also have to actually want to get back into the game
[3:16:05] EKS90_: @theDirtyon3 30 bucks is not bad for an expansion
[3:16:11] Djulio: which game?
[3:16:14] wEiRdO_dUdE: For box price, it's not a bad deal, I agree
[3:16:15] Moobot:  Towelliee.com has all of your Towelliee news WoW UI addon information, and merchandise collection. Check it out!
[3:16:15] maustercheese: but also the two games are not really quite the same kind of game
[3:16:15] Sollice: Have no duel wield class is a real l
[3:16:16] Tooyoo: Nothing wrong with charging WoW-expansion prices. But even WoW doesn't charge you for base game. You just buy latest expansion only.
[3:16:19] MrGrimms: What game is this your talking about?
[3:16:25] MoodyVanessa: i'm 100% buying the expansion
[3:16:29] Trawkey: thats half of what a wow expack
[3:16:37] Jango_: $49.99
[3:16:38] deedeemegadoodooo: $49 i think
[3:16:40] maustercheese: @MrGrimms new world

[3:17:08] maustercheese: so by that stndard it's s steal Kappa
[3:17:11] wEiRdO_dUdE: Yeah Dragonflight base cost was $49.99
[3:17:11] Tooyoo: The issue is new world is charging for the base game on top of the expansion. Which is just discouraging new players.
[3:17:13] theDirtyon3: I was going off the prices right now.
[3:17:14] RedDragonflight: i think launch though its like 70 to 120 for a wow expansion now
[3:17:21] maustercheese: standard*
[3:17:23] theDirtyon3: but yeah it was $49 on release
[3:17:25] johniiv: Yeah Diablo is still expensive tho. I'm waiting for 50% haha. but maybe it will hapen at christmas
[3:17:28] Day_Walker78: but you get the  base game in to that price also in wow
[3:17:38] jaykyew: Better comparison is the new GW2 expac which has way more content than what they're teasing
[3:17:39] dannyis1337: think 50
[3:17:43] mavericks312: I don’t think it’s fair to compare wow xpacs because you get way more in them then probably a NW xpac
[3:17:43] IgneousLion: it was 40
[3:17:43] shortyforthewin: only downside with wow is when a new expansion is coming the old one is dead dead
[3:17:50] theDirtyon3: correct
[3:17:54] CousinAvi86: can you change your twitch display or are we still watching vids?
[3:18:02] IgneousLion: 100% 40 have it in my steam transactions

[3:18:33] wEiRdO_dUdE: I've seen some of the statistics, in WoW quite a few people stay in the older expansion when a new one comes out
[3:18:33] devildriver1919: yeah im dreading the shadowlands mount farming
[3:18:39] Clay2K_: in case you missed my dub lol
[3:18:44] shortyforthewin: true true there is always things too do
[3:18:44] Clay2K_: sub*
[3:18:55] IgneousLion: Very good price
[3:19:12] botscast: @Towelliee do u think 10.2 will release before or after blizzcon

[3:20:09] Tooyoo: I honestly feel bad for game-voice actors
[3:20:22] theDirtyon3: During
[3:20:23] maustercheese: at least now the servers for new world might not have queues that much
[3:20:25] theDirtyon3: Kappa
[3:20:32] maustercheese: or at least not nearly as bad as launch
[3:20:47] Plague_GG: Liquid has to save Christmas again?
[3:20:49] johniiv: @botscast It will be for sure afterblizzcon. PTR of 10.2 will hit soon and 2 month is not enough. Also blizzcon is nov. and if they do launch before blizzcon it means rwf direct in blizzcon and most of them they go there

[3:56:27] Hybrid549: I've had the wired one and it was gooood. I use the naga pro atm souly because its wireless.  Ill look at the Scimitar wireless when there's a bit of a deal on it
[3:56:35] Waiden01: Do you think its worth trying out new world for someone who did not enjoy beta?
[3:57:13] Ezekyler: more mob variety it will be appreciatedç

[4:01:34] Wcvechten: they have awful spawnrates last time I checked
[4:02:36] Doctor_Skel: Trading and the AH will be fine for the first month or so, then you are going to see lv1 toons with white weapons with "fiery" enchants on them etc. Imo, that stuff is going to kill the experience.
[4:02:43] PastelDeNata69: @Wcvechten Just like OG WoW
[4:02:57] Molvonos: @Doctor_Skel Howso?

[4:05:05] Doctor_Skel: it tough
[4:05:36] PastelDeNata69: @Doctor_Skel I mean, you're not obliged to "explain", but it would be good to base your opinion on something other than "level 1s with Fiery enchants will kill the experience"

[4:05:47] wEiRdO_dUdE: Different levels of hardcore, true

[4:06:12] abracka_: people will do level 1 twink death duels, game is ruined
[4:06:18] Molvonos: Most people play Hardcore to play against themselves and the world, not compare themselves to 'level ones with white weapons with fiery enchants'.
[4:06:25] Timothious: or they could reset the servers in a few months lol
[4:06:29] Sielu11628: Why does it matter how "others" play the game? If your version of hardcore is "none of that stuff", then don't do it.
