[3:15:53] FoxiekittenWoW: @HowDoIBison You can on some subjects, but not on stuff which can be proving by facts. The facts is that league did not die after season 3, therefor you cant have the opinion that it did. As i said, it could have died for you, but that is something different.

[4:11:50] morapala: morapala subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 12 months! sheesh
[4:12:10] gm0re: why ppl still talking about cheating for third straight night
[4:12:14] raffay0: @flexlkopf perfect, ty
[4:12:31] konglarsen: Double destro bis 3s comp
[4:12:48] gm0re: shiiiit
[4:12:54] Joogiabi: hey why do most outlaw rogues enchant and gem mastery instead of vers? is it much more dmg?
[4:12:57] gm0re: blizz cant do shit about it?
[4:12:58] zagabombs: why would a guy w so much wow xp cheat?
[4:13:10] J0n_B: Its like that movie "The Hunt". People watching a big streamer are more likely to ignorantly believe whatever they say. So if you call someone out on cheating without proof you could really damage their rep
[4:13:18] Melvred: Do you have a geared mofeta?
[4:13:31] rhauru: the thing is if he talked something about it or just mute
[4:13:32] konglarsen: how would he cheat? Kick bot or instant kill totems or what
[4:13:51] fredslfm: Alot of high rated players actually use AHK
[4:13:53] fredslfm: So theres that
[4:13:55] Elo92: @zagabombs not saying he is, but same reason very rich people do nasty stuff to make more money they don't need^^
[4:14:07] muneplays: @konglarsen the totem part ist he second time im hearing sth about totems getting killed via "bot" is that an actual thing?
[4:14:14] t2ulater: shme
[4:14:15] nooblordxd: i dont think there was nearly enough evidence in jaime's clip, but the Perfect clip was pretty sus to me
[4:14:16] stacyer: No one is Mehh lvl <3
[4:14:17] Lieyo_: YOU are cheating the game with dh!
[4:14:22] emergence_fi: mehh was 100% using meld hacks he melded more instant cc than any1 in history of wow
[4:14:24] felgazer: What if everyone is cheating and he is the only one who is not? xD
[4:14:29] konglarsen: @muneplays was during season1. I quit mid season1 so dnu about now
[4:14:32] Ceribi: i think everyone that plays dh is cheating :)
[4:14:34] fredslfm: dh doesn't do physical dmg bud @Multiavn
[4:14:45] Bigcatattack: its not right if you know that hes cheating but if you truly dont know then you truly dont know

[4:14:54] viribus1unitis: !talents
[4:14:56] diperna99: Whats the pikaboo thing?
[4:14:57] rhauru: look at it on stream
[4:15:07] emergence_fi: did u see the movement too
[4:15:09] fredslfm: then why are u crying about plate armor nerf? When what you're saying has nothing to do with plate nerf? @Multiavn
[4:15:16] nooblordxd: that's fair
[4:15:17] Moobot: Anyone who gifts 5 Subscribers can choose a Spec of my "Geared Classes" to play in Shuffle until the next person gifts 5 Subs.
[4:15:18] emergence_fi: like the weird movement that some of the shaman bots do too
[4:15:22] rhauru: and the cloak kidney
[4:15:24] zaigodmodex: i also use focus target dmg spells
[4:15:27] mufaasa_fr: Well weak auras help with insta disarms
[4:15:28] J0n_B: it just looked laggy
[4:15:35] Like_it_Crazy: you guys where on stage with him, if there wasnt anything obvious he might be ok, but no one besides himself and blizzard knows
[4:15:39] emergence_fi: but u remember when u showed the wrath clip of the shaman when he moved weirdly? the rogue was moving similiarly
[4:15:43] unluckythen: @zaigodmodex yeeah i have focus shadowstrike backstab rupture evis secret tech
[4:15:51] unluckythen: focus sepsis macro
[4:15:52] rdubm: who is jaime competing with?
[4:15:54] Elo92: i see that movement every day because people lag, hard to believe people never seen that yet
[4:15:58] bokioz: People are paranoia
[4:15:59] Melvred: Was it you on smjrf,?
[4:16:03] dankgamer97: I dont get how ppl are so convinced rogue is cheating, looks normal  KEKW

[4:16:12] kloudykloudd: That rogue is my friend and he was on his alt acc he made this season to queue shuffle on, hes multi glad xp on his main and also challenger in league bro is a gamer
[4:16:21] emergence_fi: im not convinced he is cheating either but the movement and targeting did look rly weird
[4:16:26] DCBen: look at this
[4:16:28] zaigodmodex: @unluckythen xd
[4:16:28] DCBen: OMEGALUL
[4:16:32] fredslfm: you talked about a dh doubling your dmg, its just skill issue @Multiavn
[4:16:34] unluckythen: @fredslfm theres no point trying to argue with this guy
[4:16:40] fredslfm: yeah i guess not
[4:16:41] fredslfm: LOL
[4:16:45] Ceribi: i think everyone that plays dh is cheating :) 󠀀

[4:17:19] unluckythen: wait fred where are u from
[4:17:19] kloudykloudd: He fat fingered disarm, meant to cheap
[4:17:23] fredslfm: denmark
[4:17:34] DCBen: not even moving
[4:17:35] Lebonbeam96: @Multiavn Ur bad kid go sleep LMAOOO
[4:17:40] pookieboah: here he should step kidney
[4:17:40] emergence_fi: i wouldve cloaked the disarm prolly
[4:17:41] DCBen: to try to evasion kidney
[4:17:41] llomachenko: step kidney
[4:17:42] Pekara: rupture vanish
[4:17:43] DCBen: like movment
[4:17:43] nooblordxd: step kidney

[4:18:31] unluckythen: @Multiavn @fredslfm this message is what i mean
[4:18:32] DCBen: lasttarget macro
[4:18:38] emergence_fi: thats extremely weird
[4:18:39] Elo92: maybe he used focus and has the soft target bug that changes target
[4:18:41] nooblordxd: yea the mage targetting was odd
[4:18:42] Moobot: Don't forget to follow my Twitter to see when I go live! https://twitter.com/Whaazz
[4:18:42] unluckythen: guy called me a certain f word in dms aswell ye

[4:19:42] Lyricise: Dam, I have only watched you for a little bit Whaazz, but you have a VAST more understanding of the game then any Rogue I have ever seen. Since Reckful.
[4:19:42] kloudykloudd: LUL
[4:19:47] Elo92: actually it is^^
[4:19:49] zaigodmodex: dude has 5 screens

[4:19:49] DCBen: its like a bait play
[4:19:51] bokioz: Can we watch any Jaimy clips?
[4:19:51] emergence_fi: bro how u still not have weakaura to always hear shuffle pop
[4:19:55] J0n_B: he saw a fatass pyro coming toward him, i think it was just coincidental cloak timing
[4:19:55] DCBen: and people fall for it OMEGALUL
[4:20:09] kloudykloudd: Like Whaaz said, the ONLY THING that was sus about this game was the insta cloak on pika's blades from stealth
[4:20:23] Elo92: i mean, he clearly cloaked before he got out of stun. didn't script it to the kidney
[4:20:23] Moobot: Anyone who gifts 5 Subscribers can choose a Spec of my "Geared Classes" to play in Shuffle until the next person gifts 5 Subs.
[4:20:23] kloudykloudd: But the dude (who is on my real ID) literally told me it was a miss press

[4:23:56] itsBdaws: that’s cheating bro no man on the planet has their entire rotation on focus macros
[4:23:56] jimmystruggs: ppl actually bot tho, what’s so unbelievable about another botter
[4:23:57] kelqoo: who hasnt missclicked disarm LUL
[4:23:58] nilitar: he 100% pressed cloak cuz mage was busting on him while pika was stunned lets not overthink cloak
[4:23:59] Like_it_Crazy: maybe we overthinking this all and he is not good and its an unlucky combination of keybinds he played
[4:24:01] emergence_fi: i just find the movement and targeting wierd thats all
[4:24:01] Nextrkw: think it was a crack a claw moment like w swapxy the other time
[4:24:06] slaughthemage: I have blinded on bubble so many times
[4:24:08] onedayoumay985: the cloak war normal
[4:24:09] felgazer: I just think pros call people cheaters when they get outplayed - kids do crazy stuff nowadays in fortnite and stuff

[4:24:14] Mood1001: having a focus bind for every button is lil weird
[4:24:15] f3elsok: the targeting for some seconds was weird where he switched targets 10 times in like 2 secs
[4:24:17] llomachenko: the cloak is normal af ngl
[4:24:18] deepsyu: weirdest thing was targeting mage while hitting pika
[4:24:19] onedayoumay985: was*

[4:24:47] zagabombs: i wanna see some jaime cips
[4:24:56] onedayoumay985: mainly the focus shit is weird
[4:24:58] viribus1unitis: ye the reasoning you did about the cloak timing is just pretty common i did it multiple times too
[4:25:04] Elo92: pika playing on 1.6k prob. also gets reported 10x a day, doesn't mean he's cheating. just playing much lower rating that he is actually at
[4:25:10] beastboyy122: you know Jaime is cheating because look at your face when it happened @whaazz
[4:25:23] beastboyy122: your reaction said it all

[4:28:06] unluckythen: rip shuffle
[4:28:08] emergence_fi: i rewatched the pikaboo clip i actually think the rogue wasnt cheating now, the only thing might be the targeting but maybe he is using targetlasttarget macros and thats what was happening with it
[4:28:11] nikthevoker: looks like he earth shocked him this time, dif clip
[4:28:11] mysteriousm4n: insta knock on the wild charge wtf
[4:28:16] bobthegoblin_: I mean hunters do this with Scatter all the time
[4:28:28] unluckythen: @emergence_fi who tf has that on normal macros 😭
[4:28:31] Scrubxlol: @Whaazz but why did you compete with him then to be honest (given you already suspected him to cheat in the first place)
[4:28:36] DCBen: I got blamed for melding hunt 3x in a game

[4:29:57] metrylka: @Whaazz with u vs jaime
[4:30:06] dusttiy: @Nextrkw getting banged from all sides..
[4:30:08] J0n_B: from that clip it looks as if hes waiting for it, he ain't pressing anything else
[4:30:08] JmanOwnz: i came in late are we saying he is using a script or he is just that insane?
[4:30:11] kloudykloudd: I mean hasn't jaime played on the highest lvl in EU for multiple expansions? it isn't that suspect for top level players (especially on EU) to read players and pre knock people's goes right?
[4:30:12] Mokry_kek: and ofc he dont stream or play on lan right?
[4:30:19] dankgamer97: KEKW
[4:30:20] Zurgok: wtf
[4:30:21] AstralScare: BRO
[4:30:24] mysteriousm4n: yea no way
[4:30:26] kloudykloudd: Back in the day this kind of stuff happened at the highest level all the time
[4:30:26] Moobot: Anyone who gifts 5 Subscribers can choose a Spec of my "Geared Classes" to play in Shuffle until the next person gifts 5 Subs.
[4:30:32] mysteriousm4n: that's some bullshit
[4:30:34] emergence_fi: Knockgodx
[4:30:35] zaigodmodex: lontar insta raging
[4:30:35] kloudykloudd: The game has just changed and so moments like this are outliers now
[4:30:35] Zurgok: no thats bullshit
[4:30:36] bobthegoblin_: tbh Jellybeans does insane scatters that are similar to this
[4:30:37] konglarsen: well, he saw him coming there. targetted him before jumping
[4:30:39] Davidtvs: questionable
[4:30:40] Echo_Esports: Want to learn from the best? Visit echogg.ly/coaching/Whaazz and pick the Echo player that suits your needs!
[4:30:42] sind233: Looks legit
[4:30:43] mufaasa_fr: That looks weird yeah haha
[4:30:45] ThePdfreak: are there clips where he does it too early or late ?
[4:30:48] GRC_chris: people used to do outplays like that 15 years ago without weakauras, nowadays with weakauras it's easy to be a lot more consistent with that
[4:30:50] Davidtvs: looks questionable
[4:30:50] VONDAVVE: i mean it happends abit too much 4Head
[4:30:51] shango007: ORRRRR.... he is a cheater KEKW
[4:30:51] dammagedbraincells: hes awareness is carzy
[4:30:52] viribus1unitis: its only an ele mecanic no?
[4:30:52] DCBen: weakaura
[4:30:52] Vethosis: he's predicting before it happens
[4:30:55] lysonair: its Thrall CONFIRMED
[4:30:56] nooblordxd: can look at it frame by frame and see if the timing is the exact same, then it's sus
[4:30:56] nikthevoker: would he still of knocked without the wildcharge? thats what im wondering
[4:30:57] DCBen: 1k money on weakaura
[4:30:58] M4dmanGG: He was already targeting him though, looks like he is waiting for it
[4:30:58] joshjohn7: defo cheating
[4:31:01] GodzWoW: have you seen how the ele bot works lol
[4:31:02] GnelGnelGnel: does jaime not stream?
[4:31:07] Zurgok: does he play lan tournaments?
[4:31:07] t1moxxx: best player confirmed
[4:31:07] bobthegoblin_: his awareness is just too insane
[4:31:08] infernion: The knocks are one thing, the kicks are 100% just straight up impossible man
[4:31:11] stacyer: any kicks clips
[4:31:16] stacyer: show
[4:31:20] Melvred: Did he play lan ?
[4:31:27] dusttiy: eeeee cope
[4:31:27] t1moxxx: any kicks clips?
[4:31:28] HowDoIBison: Bro hit 25 kicks in a 5 min game
[4:31:28] infernion: Not only did he hit that amount of kicks, he did it in the BOOMKIN meta where cyclone was a 0.3s cast and everyone else couldn't kick for shit
[4:31:32] frostbyte1123: the wow community cant accept a prodigy, hes just good
[4:31:35] Zurgok: nice guys can still take steroids and compete at the top bro
[4:31:35] holgrood: U can get some really insane WAs nowadays
[4:31:42] immakeepcominback: to be fair he does change target to Lontar right before as he sees him pushing in
[4:31:43] Funkstar001: he needs to record his mouse and keyboard now
[4:31:44] Balthizaar: @Whaazz Was he able to do the same stuff at blizzcon? You guys played with no addons
[4:31:48] dusttiy: EEEEEE COPE
[4:31:48] Balthizaar: That would tell you all you need to know
[4:31:49] chromaxen: Dont fuel the flame pls
[4:31:49] Zurgok: lance armstrong still a nice guy and cudda been a great competitor without the roids
[4:31:51] kloudykloudd: hes not a prodigy though lol
[4:31:53] renberg31: what's your ping?
[4:31:56] xHeythemops: he won a lan right ?
[4:31:57] Aldragonn: but he isnt new
[4:31:57] kloudykloudd: hasnt Jaime been R1 for years?
[4:31:58] ZankedS: really nice guy :)
[4:32:00] Aldragonn: he been around since wod
[4:32:00] mufaasa_fr: How is jaime new ?
[4:32:01] bobthegoblin_: @frostbyte1123 the problem is hes been at the top level for 12 years and he improved suddenly
[4:32:06] Feroxita1337: jaime is not new xD
[4:32:07] M4dmanGG: 2 leap kocks at the same time might be random, but if it's scripted it should be every leap?
[4:32:08] kloudykloudd: @Aldragonn thats what I thought lol
[4:32:10] Zurgok: @kloudykloudd big diff from r1 to tournament level
[4:32:12] t1moxxx: @ZankedS just better player :)
[4:32:14] nooblordxd: the crazy part about cheating in WoW, is if you showed these clips to people without audio, most people wouldn't think twice about it or even realize what made it possibly "cheating"
[4:32:20] breezey1990: Just wait for him to attend a Torniment and we can see how well he does !
[4:32:20] ardalolthe: zeepeye and swapxy was better than him

[4:32:24] massiveshade: jaime has been around since MoP at least
[4:32:28] nikthevoker: when SL hit didnt he ascend?
[4:32:31] Cokeboii: but @Whaazz has he been putting in the time to improve ? you did a huge skill gap growth too
[4:32:33] kloudykloudd: zeep
[4:32:33] konglarsen: he went from Lewandowski level to Messi/CR7 level
[4:32:37] fredslfm: @dusttiy vær stille skat
[4:32:42] M4dmanGG: @Whaazz 2 leap kocks at the same time might be random, but if it's scripted it should be every leap right?
[4:32:44] mufaasa_fr: Just like you make some rogue looks average lol
[4:32:44] AstralScare: LUL
[4:32:45] lysonair: KEKW

[4:32:58] Nextrkw: cus ure dogshit
[4:33:00] Zeneri: trenStare
[4:33:02] gorthakk: you miss too many kicks
[4:33:02] Nextrkw: u fail everything
[4:33:03] infernion: OK YESTERDAY YOU SHAT ON ME
[4:33:03] nikthevoker: @infernion LMLFAO
[4:33:04] Akrololz: can't cheat with 50% kick rate WAIT WHAT HUH
[4:33:07] o_tho: how do you cheat?
[4:33:09] infernion: YES YOU ACTUALLY DID
[4:33:09] GnelGnelGnel: does jaime not stream at all? that would be the easiest way to disprove it
[4:33:10] Like_it_Crazy: some people born with a cheat inside
[4:33:11] Vendrek: I will say this. I had a guildmaster that liked dueling me on my warrior while they played frost mage. After a while I started getting to the point I was anticipating his moves and able to counter and beat him. Jaime could be the same.
[4:33:12] infernion: I was like ???? cuz you always kick like shit
[4:33:12] ThePdfreak: too washed to be called a cheater PepeHands
[4:33:13] stacyer: Jaime streamed before but now stopped as well? sus
[4:33:13] frostbyte1123: jamie needs to stream his gameplay to stop the hate
[4:33:17] Balthizaar: impossible to call you a cheater when you play with scuffed UI on LAN manually counting your combo points lmfao
[4:33:18] infernion: But yesterday you blasted me so hard
[4:33:20] Balthizaar: You're a freak of nature
[4:33:30] ForgottenOnee: @whaazz u make every r1 player look average so i dont know
[4:33:41] kloudykloudd: listen, most of the "top shamans" are nowhere near as good at the game as the top mages rogues or priests etc, I think jaime is just insane at the game period and so he's showing people the true potential of shaman
[4:33:50] zaigodmodex: kicking eyebeams like its nothing
[4:33:53] dammagedbraincells: its the range
[4:33:55] konglarsen: its because as DH you dont have to think at all
[4:33:57] ThePdfreak: dont have to pay attention to anything else
[4:34:03] Loadedmvp: @Whaazz let him be good online he is gonna be dog on tourneys anyways LUL
[4:34:07] emergence_fi: well outlaw has 2x faster globals than dh i think
[4:34:08] dammagedbraincells: dh's kick is longer
[4:34:08] ardalolthe: because dh faceroll
[4:34:09] kloudykloudd: shaman can afk and win
[4:34:10] emergence_fi: with AR up
[4:34:13] Simmersz: is ur kick bind the same on DH and rogue?
[4:34:24] unluckythen: ive said the same
[4:34:30] dusttiy: he streamed abit, but did nothing crazy, missed kicks, after stream hes a monster
[4:34:31] unluckythen: if he streamed it would help
[4:34:32] fredslfm: New game GUYS: Take a shot everytime Whaazz says ''jamie''
[4:34:32] dusttiy: 4Head
[4:34:33] unluckythen: but he NEVER  streams
[4:34:42] ardalolthe: @Whaazz did he do these craxy shits in lan?
[4:34:46] skysnip3z: didnt he play with you at blizzcon though, at the guild clash
[4:34:46] nikthevoker: ripple effect
[4:34:47] ThePdfreak: he is cheating though
[4:34:47] rdubm: cancel culturrrrer
[4:35:01] bokioz: I did not even know Jaime had cheating sus, I found out this stream atm
[4:35:18] kloudykloudd: its hard not to at that point
[4:35:21] ardalolthe: @Whaazz Was he doing these things in lan though?
[4:35:25] kloudykloudd: 25 kicks in a 5 minute game is insane
[4:35:26] dankgamer97: Your such a good guy Whaazz FeelsStrongMan  Clap
[4:35:28] hieronmunaa: "Jaime just play at 75% today"
[4:35:29] Moobot: Anyone who gifts 5 Subscribers can choose a Spec of my "Geared Classes" to play in Shuffle until the next person gifts 5 Subs.
[4:35:31] infernion: For someone to "prove" it you have to stream for a consistent amount now and have the kickrate he had. Like "replicate" the performance right. If he streams and lands 50% of kicks then obv something was off
[4:35:33] kloudykloudd: maybe he just bought some adderall that night or something
[4:35:35] kloudykloudd: lol
[4:35:37] healgladiator: lol u say u never PLAY DH
[4:35:37] phantomhunterxz: Jaime real lvl was demonstrated many times on the Bllizzcon (nothing spesial)
[4:35:52] muneplays: Wouldnt it be just really easy to check addons/WAs whether or not if its a bot if its not inside hardware?
[4:35:53] notMyk: (nothing spesial)
[4:35:54] massiveshade: the accusations got worse at the start of DF, also doesn't help that he's playing on the classes with the most amount of cheating/scripting
[4:35:59] lysonair: Det er politiets opgave at bevise du er skyldig og ikke omvendt tho
[4:36:01] lysonair: :)
[4:36:02] croivan18: he has to start to stream no other way
[4:36:15] Mokry_kek: yeah u guys dont care if gae is bad, pvp is dead, ppl are cheating, rly wholesome community never complaining
[4:36:17] shredder1111: imagine the pressure though if he streams and knows that if he doesnt land all his kicks people will trash him
[4:36:18] amherian001: cheating in what way? can someone explain
[4:36:25] mumleon_: if he doesnt do those crazy tricks live, it would be obvious he is pretending no?
[4:36:29] fredslfm: check him pc
[4:36:39] kloudykloudd: @mumleon_ exactly
[4:36:41] diskmachin1: @fredslfm that is not noramlly
[4:36:43] frostbyte1123: or he records and uploads his gameplay to youtube, less stress
[4:37:01] Echo_Esports: Gear up for raid with a world-class sitting experience. Enjoy the same long-lasting comfort as Echo, only with the Secretlab TITAN Evo gaming chair: echogg.ly/secretlab/Whaazz
[4:37:11] kloudykloudd: if someone's gameplay off stream is double the quality of someone's gameplay on stream there is something fishy going on no question about it
[4:37:32] kloudykloudd: unless the person has terrible stage fright or something and lets be honest its a fucking video game
[4:37:44] konglarsen: præstationsangst
[4:37:52] massiveshade: in the online qualifiers, you see the difference already there
[4:38:05] dammagedbraincells: innocent until proven guilty
[4:38:08] slaughthemage: @Whaazz  how do u make it so that only crits show?
[4:38:10] Melc4: maybe it's just a server issue, with lag it look sus.
[4:38:12] babemagnet: babemagnet subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 5 months! 
[4:38:30] ganaken_: @Whaazz bro i believe there are 2 arguments.
[4:38:31] Pekara: do u know how stupid that rogue clips looks vs jaimes KEKW
[4:38:33] unluckythen: calling the police on jamie rn
[4:39:04] konglarsen: OMG missed my soloS queue watching this DH gameplay MonkaS
[4:39:04] windythemllf: Jaime calls me a drama whore for calling him a bot KEKW

[4:39:06] renberg31: ping diff interesting talking bout jamie
[4:39:10] AstralScare: huh?
[4:39:10] MaybeRespect: Because blizz abandoned pvp in general. botting/ahk balance issues,mmr issues
[4:39:14] kloudykloudd: wait what? LOL
[4:39:20] boblord: that sounds like the biggest load of shit i've heard
[4:39:21] kloudykloudd: this sounds like bullshit to me
[4:39:28] kloudykloudd: @boblord 100%
[4:39:33] gorthakk: is he bobby koticks son?
[4:39:37] Elo92: why wouldn't they be able to ban a player?
[4:39:38] GnelGnelGnel: yeah youre flat out wrong, blizz can literally ban anyone at any time
[4:39:39] unluckythen: ur also the only one beating him
[4:39:43] Shashka76: Where can I find jaime's clips?
[4:39:44] kelqoo: atleast its not cs2 major qualifier lvl of cheating KEKW
[4:39:50] thestoong: didnt jamie used to stream and he still blasted?
[4:39:51] Zimed: Is it something that in order to prove it they would have to breach into people's privacy beyond their rights or something? Just a guess here
[4:39:53] infernion: I wonder why that is....
[4:40:08] nikthevoker: iis it only his team mates?
[4:40:09] unluckythen: @infernion infy can i talk to u
[4:40:09] kloudykloudd: there's no way that a player can be immune to being banned
[4:40:12] massiveshade: it's the same reason why the top streamers don't get punished for doing obv rule breaking stuff
[4:40:16] infernion: @thestoong Jaime is a good player, ofc he's gonna blast if he streams, we're talking about the kicks here lol. No one says he's bad
[4:40:19] winnick__: Every NA player calls jaime cheater
[4:40:19] kloudykloudd: unless his dad owns the company or something lol
[4:40:19] windythemllf: If he is not cheating he is superhuman
[4:40:20] the_lootgoblin: why wouldnt he just stream and shut the haters down
[4:40:21] Vendrek: This is why the cups should be on Blizzard Lan...then if he still does his knocks and kicks it would be obvious he isn't cheating.
[4:40:22] boblord: jaime has diplomatic immunity lads ggs it's over Sadge
[4:40:26] massiveshade: Blizz likes them or wants them there
[4:40:27] Like_it_Crazy: for cs on ESL you get a client to play with, if you dont wanna play with it you dont play any tournament, you have to accept they searching on your pc
[4:40:35] phantomhunterxz: Jaime use scripts period! And this is the reason why he will never win Blizzcon

[4:41:08] bokioz: But some top players got banned before, they could not play AWC? i dont remember who
[4:41:12] zaigodmodex: @Whaazz isnt even the guy who creates the bots telling hes legit cheating
[4:41:17] Elo92: i mean, if blizz "can't" ban someone for whatever reason, then everyone will just start cheating soon, because why not^^
[4:41:17] slaughthemage: @Whaazz  how do u make it so that only crits show?
[4:41:18] southylolz: ffs whaaz, stop petting the cat cuz ur removing my dots
[4:41:46] kloudykloudd: @bokioz that was for conduct, not scripting
[4:41:49] Sokkee: @Whaazz  how can you eaven make a kickbot thats hit all the timeß
[4:41:53] crawnpocktail: @slaughthemage i think its classic numbers reborn

[4:42:32] anydelicioux: how do you even cheat in wow kekw
[4:42:38] kloudykloudd: yeah I mean then its obvious
[4:42:41] ganaken_: @Whaazz 1. even if jamie is using script or bot the bot wont be able to press the ability since jamie is spamming abilities and will be on GCD. therefore, he truly holds his GCD.  2. How many times does he do it in a match? if a bot or script then it shouldnt it be 100%?   3. the reaction is insanely inhumane tbh xD im just throwing ideas bro not sure
[4:42:44] shredder1111: yea the next outlaw bot is gonna be insane
[4:42:54] dusttiy: where i can buy this popular "Bot"? Kappa
[4:42:56] windythemllf: You can even ask the bot if you generalize it to watch jaime gameplay and say if this is bot play or not
[4:42:56] kloudykloudd: @ganaken_ exactly
[4:42:59] whyseriouz: who is jamie?

[4:43:02] anydelicioux: u dont need to focus ur DH
[4:43:04] nooblordxd: need someone to break down the knockbacks frame by frame and see if they happen at the exact same time
[4:43:07] whyseriouz: @ganaken_ does jamie stream
[4:43:12] killswitch941: how do you cheat in wow
[4:43:18] aUNINGz: why is the camera constantly shaking
[4:43:19] nikthevoker: is it pokemonz or another person on EU?
[4:43:19] killswitch941: is it a pvp thing?
[4:43:19] Melvred: He must sit domewhere very safe so blizz can't sue his ass into oblivion
[4:43:28] lolkaterica: @aUNINGz for more damage
[4:43:29] ganaken_: @whyseriouz not sure bro tbh
[4:43:33] palablitz: cheating for 12 dollars cash prize awc
[4:43:35] dankgamer97: @aUNINGz +100 ekstra dmg
[4:43:41] Fendersquire: if it was a nobody that was cheating, I wouldn't be surprised. But Jaime is quite well kown, why risk it and he doesn't need to anyway, he's a very good player.
[4:43:46] windythemllf: RBG is full of Kultirans DnasGame
[4:43:49] windythemllf: DansGame
[4:43:52] Thoec: pojke played kultiran back when he was still playing retail minSAD
[4:43:54] Vendrek: If it is effective CC rotation why not use it.
[4:44:02] crawnpocktail: @ganaken_ isnt shear not on GCD?
[4:44:09] kelqoo: @Fendersquire he was tired of losing to rogue mage and tweet about it every day so he figured out a way to win KEKW
[4:44:22] mysteriousm4n: I thought shear and thunderstorm are off GCD @ganaken_
[4:44:24] smooyacs: how much to play resto sham on stream
[4:44:26] dammagedbraincells: maybe jamie is the whaazz of shamans
[4:44:27] massiveshade: @Fendersquire you'll be surprised the amount of the best/greats resort to cheating cause they "need" to be up there
[4:44:40] ganaken_: @mysteriousm4n @KKPkMn ye thats true also
[4:44:51] kloudykloudd: nah there are scripts where people only have to move. they have full scripts. like if u wanna burst, u hold down lets say F key and it does ur full burst rotation perfectly. if u want to spam cc u hold down certain key and it auto jukes when they press kick, this is how scripts work in wow @killswitch941
[4:45:09] ganaken_: @mysteriousm4n @KKPkMn but he isnt using or no? not sure xD
[4:45:25] ganaken_: @mysteriousm4n @KKPkMn i mean isnt this unleash ? not sheer or thunderstorm
[4:45:59] crawnpocktail: @ganaken_ i'm not sure, havent seen any of his gameplay in a long while

[4:46:45] kiefxd: oh jk he just doesn't holy shock at all
[4:46:48] kiefxd: jfc
[4:47:34] palablitz: truth is if jaime was cheating blizzard wouldn't even care so we will never know uf he's cheating as he might never get even punished for it
