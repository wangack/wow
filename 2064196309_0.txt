[6:58:00] snejpen: lil bro be asking a question and then not look at chat for 5 minutes classic
[6:58:01] 5L4Y3R: Prompt: A large orange octopus is seen resting on the bottom of the ocean floor, blending in with the sandy and rocky terrain. Its tentacles are spread out around its body, and its eyes are closed. The octopus is unaware of a king crab that is crawling towards it from behind a rock, its claws raised and ready to attack. The crab is brown and spiny, with long legs and antennae. The scene is captured from a wide angle, showing the vastness and depth of the ocean. The water is clear and blue, with
[6:58:03] 5L4Y3R: rays of sunlight filtering through. The shot is sharp and crisp, with a high dynamic range. The octopus and the crab are in focus, while the background is slightly blurred, creating a depth of field effect.

[9:24:10] totelol: Phimosis (from Greek φίμωσις phimōsis 'muzzling') is a condition in which the foreskin of the penis cannot stretch to allow it to be pulled back past the glans. A balloon-like swelling under the foreskin may occur with urination. In teenagers and adults, it may result in pain during an erection, but is otherwise not painful.  Those affected are at greater risk of inflammation of the glans, known as balanitis, and other complications.
