However, for some, it can be an acquired taste. Also known as bittersweet chocolate, dark chocolate is different from milk chocolate. Candy makers add milk or butter to milk chocolate, giving it a creamier consistency. Dark chocolate includes no added milk or butter. mwah mwah

Many tout dark chocolate as the healthier chocolate. However, for some, it can be an acquired taste. Also known as bittersweet chocolate, dark chocolate is different from milk chocolate. Candy makers add milk or butter to milk chocolate, giving it a creamier consistency. Dark chocolate includes no added milk or butter. mwah mwah  For @Mitchiegan

[1:34:28] Masqerader: because last year, there was an issue with Bell for me, where it was only affecting Blizzard, everything else worked fine, so it could be one of those weird instances

[1:40:19] Stitorex: @TyndiVelspaz Youre math aint mathin
[1:40:24] SylarSavage: Yeah so it's not 1/5 it'd be 1/3 but that's not what he's talking about lol
[1:40:31] TyndiVelspaz: 1 in 3 times 5
[1:40:44] TyndiVelspaz: since it happened 5 times in a row
[1:40:49] Swiftar: 1/3 4 times in a row (don't hate me I did this kind of stuff for work once)
[1:41:00] Swiftar: It happens 5 times but you don't care about the first
[1:41:09] SylarSavage: @Luxthos If my math is correct, the odds are 1.66
[1:41:11] SylarSavage: %

[1:42:20] SylarSavage: @Luxthos IF my math is correct, it's 1.66%
[1:43:03] Swiftar: Yeah, it's a difference of "What are the chances if I flip a coin and get the same result twice" vs " What are the chances of flipping a coin and getting heads twice."
[1:43:11] Swiftar: Different results if you're more specific
[1:43:14] SylarSavage: Yeah idk if it has a specific targeter but having it choose someone 5 times in a row is crazy lol

[2:05:24] Aggy: You two decided at the same time that the break was over
[2:05:41] Aggy: Badges are a fucking nightmare
[2:05:41] ShroudedFoxx: Last Epoch I think
[2:06:03] Aggy: it took months for sloot and I to come up with a somewhat viable concept
[2:06:06] Aggy: they look great
[2:06:24] Swiftar: Sub badge could be a cup of coffee getting progressively more full luxthoHmm

[2:23:59] OrthiadNick: I think it's fine as long as it won't be gear and stuff you can buy. As long it's all cosmetic, the level 70 boost with upgrades and such was meh though
[2:24:00] SylarSavage: I feel like blizzard doesn't care about their brand anymore.
[2:24:02] JustObSoLEET: they belong to a corporation, they have a legal responsibility to do it for their shareholders
[2:24:07] ermymunster: Okay I'm back and extra weeby

[2:25:03] misomander: you stay in combat as murloc
[2:25:05] xluckydawgx: @ermymunster Still to this day, I dont think most people ever watched the anime were ayayaya came from
[2:25:06] misomander: with new toy
[2:25:08] umcharama: How is it scummy? No one is forced to purchased items from the shop. It doesn't provide game play advantage. It's purely cosmetic.
[2:25:10] ermymunster: Oh did I come back to a "big corporation bad" argument?
[2:25:29] misomander: its like a thing you place down
[2:25:33] misomander: i think anyone can use it
[2:25:39] ermymunster: @xluckydawgx Same with the people who use the "WOOOOOW" sound bite KEKW
[2:25:41] OrthiadNick: luxthoNote luxthoNote luxthoNote
[2:25:46] xluckydawgx: @xluckydawgx KEKW
[2:26:13] ermymunster: @xluckydawgx Real talk the "WOOOOOW" is my text tone lmao
[2:26:35] Stitorex: imo cosmetics like that could have been a quest line, or in game event
[2:26:36] xluckydawgx: @xluckydawgx Thats genius KEKW
[2:26:38] misomander: drop the toy in the dungeon
[2:26:39] ElmSpace: box price, sub price, and then added micro transactions
[2:26:43] SylarSavage: They legit could have made that a rare spawn dropped item from a boss or something
[2:26:47] SylarSavage: INstead they made it cost money
[2:26:54] umcharama: I understand your perspective. But one could argue there is enough content or cosmetics in the game to justify your sub. This is just smart business. If people are buying, they are going to keep selling.
[2:27:03] Davinah_00: but they could also just make the sub every month more money
[2:27:12] Davinah_00: when is the last time they raised it
[2:27:19] JustObSoLEET: it's def scummy
[2:27:27] Stitorex: @Davinah_00 I dont think they ever have
[2:27:27] StreamElements:  Thanks to Starforge for powering and sponsoring the stream! Max out your FPS with a new Starforge PC at https://starforgepc.com/Luxthos
[2:27:34] Davinah_00: @Stitorex exactly
[2:27:36] Masqerader: i find it scummy that POE charges for stash space, should have been in the game at no cost
[2:27:38] Stitorex: Business is usually scummy by nature
[2:27:57] SylarSavage: @Masqerader Surprised diablo devs didn't do that for d4
[2:28:02] JustObSoLEET: normally those businesses are not publicly traded
[2:28:14] Soelmend: The money they make off this item could pay for an additional quest being developed. Not that it will, probably going to a stock buyback
[2:28:20] Stitorex: For instance, raising canes chicken, during covid. All the board of directors didnt take a salary to make sure there people got paid and turned there restaraunts into mask manufacturing
[2:28:22] xluckydawgx: Welcome to Late Stage captalism everyone! luxthoBrother
[2:28:26] Stitorex: Thats not scummy business
[2:28:44] Davinah_00: again, they could sell things in the shop, or raise the sub
[2:29:17] Masqerader: cause they're hypocrites   "blizzard, they're evil they sell shit"   POE "but they need the money to keep the game alive, cause it's free to play and they make 10s of millions each year"
[2:29:18] GrimGoreRMW: luxthoHmm
[2:29:34] Peanutbeards: I dont mind if a portion of it was going toward the rewards pool like MDI ect, or for a charity.
[2:29:42] TyndiVelspaz: nah making money more important
[2:29:46] umcharama: What spec is your warlock right now?
[2:29:53] wolfly_1: neat a new murloc class take my money
[2:30:33] SylarSavage: You mean they added a toy that turns you into a murloc instead of just giving us murloc race class? LUL
[2:30:34] FrankTheTank1988: the new MurLOCK class huh luxthoKEK
[2:31:00] Effin_Steffin: plz no

[4:29:32] sl1nky1981: Hey @joustiif , was thinking about you earlier today. I hope you're having a good day today!
[4:29:32] kezzla_: I don't
[4:29:33] brigands_: 2nd monitor for stream and I just tried to right click and move your camera
[4:29:47] kezzla_: the poison bomb applies the dot
[4:29:52] Aggy: @brigands_ did it work
[4:30:02] brigands_: indirectly yes
[4:30:49] joustiif: @sl1nky1981 I am indeed been busy with moving so it's keeping me occupied
[4:30:59] brigands_: doing a key on hunter? getting another joke ready for my application
[4:31:37] Zladar: da fuck that dps, is it real?
[4:31:47] Zladar: how is it doing st?
[4:32:44] Hyponatremic: they gave survival all the BM abilities so BM has none
[4:32:54] Hyponatremic: jk but it is crazy the difference
[4:33:01] sl1nky1981: @sl1nky1981 Moving sucks but at least it gives you something to focus on lol
[4:34:46] joustiif: @sl1nky1981 indeed it does, i hate moving but hopefully it's for a long time since me and my brother own the home, not renting anymore
[4:34:57] haddix86: @Luxthos this may be a dumb question but how do you get the damage numbers to show up on the mobs?
[4:35:12] alteration1545: you also want to hit the enemies with the bomb
[4:35:36] sl1nky1981: @sl1nky1981 oh that's awesome! I've moved 4 times in 11 years, but we have a 2.75% interest rate on our current home so........guess I'll just die here.
[4:36:15] azzurro86: dont forget moongoose bite

[4:37:44] joustiif: @sl1nky1981 yep i would for sure not give up that interest rate, think we got like 5.2% if i remember right
[4:38:12] haddix86: @Luxthos is that an addon that shows the damage numbers on the mobs?
[4:38:19] brigands_: but as long as you can be happy where your going and not get destroyed finally moving, it can be ok

[4:57:43] Fafnyir: Anyone available in game to raid real quick so I can turn in the head enchant quest?
[4:57:48] Demetor_: it's pretty good damage but shines in aoe
[4:58:00] misomander: nah you dont take hydra bite
[4:58:04] SylarSavage: Because most poeple don't take it
[4:58:09] misomander: your wildfire infusion does it for you
[4:58:12] sarrowzthewarlock: @Tzarrus i ran a 16 AD with a prot pally that barley used defensives get eaten by raz and then blamed me for shitty healing lmao
[4:58:15] Demetor_: it's more of a niche talent
[4:58:52] Lussyisbabby: @sarrowzthewarlock Imagine failing as a prot PALADIN with self heals/defensives. LUL
[4:59:18] sarrowzthewarlock: he didnt even BoP himself lmao
[4:59:35] Tzarrus: @sarrowzthewarlock my groups tanked it out in the middle and i had to use steed just to make it out of sight ...needless to say the rest of the group was feared and the keys failed before it even began
[5:00:51] sarrowzthewarlock: i did like 140khps overall in that key and most of it was the pally as a MW monk lmao
[5:00:53] SylarSavage: Most tanks are not use to getting eaten by rezan
[5:01:12] Gummybeard1: what are defensives?
[5:02:18] misomander: no
[5:02:20] kingsanity81: how u liking it so far
[5:02:22] misomander: you need to have one on
[5:02:25] misomander: and itll cleave it
[5:02:35] sarrowzthewarlock: readings hardlol
[5:03:06] Tzarrus: @SylarSavage yeah bc you have to pay attention to if you become the target and then run as soon as you see your character

[5:03:57] StreamElements:  Enjoying the stream? Considering subscribing to support: https://www.twitch.tv/subs/luxthos
[5:04:03] SylarSavage: As a tank it's really hard for you to know if he's gonna eat you before he actually does it. With that said, it still gives you PLENTY of time to pop a Defensive before it ticks to much damage
[5:04:19] misomander: yeah
[5:04:32] misomander: so def wanna make sure its up then you can pretty much forget it
[5:05:10] misomander: blue is shrapnel
[5:05:12] misomander: just a bleed dot
[5:05:20] misomander: red gives you kill command resets while its up
[5:06:11] misomander: need good bomb rng
[5:06:16] sarrowzthewarlock: fish for bombs lol
[5:06:37] misomander: kinda? depends on the bomb you have
[5:06:39] sarrowzthewarlock: i had a weak aura that told me to keep fishing for red in SL lmao
[5:06:57] misomander: for ST you def wanna keep red up afaik
[5:07:04] misomander: and you just brainlessly spam KC iirc
[5:07:53] misomander: or i guess youd triple KC > raptor
[5:09:59] misomander: maybe its changed from SL idr

[5:15:26] FatGuyLaughing: So do big pulls, then kill them. Then wait for stacks to go away?
[5:15:26] Masqerader: LOL
[5:15:37] Masqerader: if you can't heal bursting, get out of my key :P
[5:16:21] sarrowzthewarlock: i leanred to roll imps into next pack in SL lmao so ill use tyrant on a pack and implode 20 imps into next pack and almost rip aggro from tank xD
[5:16:57] sarrowzthewarlock: yea i still do
