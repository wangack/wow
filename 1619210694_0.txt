[2:28:12] Timkoch02: Is this the only M+ available for testing?
[2:28:16] bloodogg35: crash and burn wipe out
[2:28:17] Trorg: looks like another boss fight that hates melee
[2:28:40] Shurn_82: waiiittt... the fire on the ground ISNT A BUFF :P
[2:28:44] Vahs_Redclaw: i was thinking the same there is just so much crap on the floor
[2:28:53] GluconGaming: @Shurn_82 always a buff
[2:29:07] Shurn_82: haha always a buff is the right answer :D
[2:29:07] Rohen86: Stand in fire, DPS higher
[2:30:30] GluconGaming: higher does rhyme with fire... sound logic
[2:31:41] BlewGamingGroup: working as intended
[2:31:51] Rohen86: So it looks like the winds always come from behind the dragon and it pushes the flames towards the tank so will probably be a strat to use that effectively
[2:31:52] Moobot: Towelliee will be playing WOTLK Classic on the Fresh server Maladath.
[2:31:57] Robodope: i'm gonna hate that affix
[2:32:06] captain69: thats nice fight for melee right!?
[2:32:14] G_pir: its no extra fire, its fire paches around you not on you
[2:32:15] BlewGamingGroup: yea , that has to be fixed
[2:32:23] G_pir: so you gotta all stack
[2:32:30] MarquisLek: its circles everywhere
[2:32:40] G_pir: still overtuned tho
[2:33:04] Menion01: So, you are saying they are gonna pull the ripcord on the affix?

[2:38:33] Shurn_82: haha i knoiw
[2:38:35] Rohen86: So I looked at the journal and you get a debuff that stacks that creates more pools on the ground on that fight
[2:39:15] pereadin: yeah we woulda 3 chested it if the last boss wasn't such a cuck
[2:39:33] GluconGaming: ya that last boss seemed bonkers right now
[2:39:56] Rohen86: Basically, if your group dodges Roaring Firebreath and Flamespit they shouldn't drop puddles
[2:40:40] pereadin: yeah I liked it

[3:05:28] Shurn_82: @daSPAMit all good, it was dealt with appropriately, too bad it had to come to a bn
[3:05:58] slackstacker: did you get all your weapon and armor enchants?
[3:05:59] pereadin: I hope they keep it, just scale it down for us
[3:06:04] KyleEverett: it's supposed to be ret only, but I think they're not getting it right now

[3:09:09] slackstacker: i think blizzard should of took more time on these talent trees. theres abilities that should just be base line and the talents should give the ability to choose a few things from other specs
[3:09:52] Luxthos: @daSPAMit Talent tree replace skill attribution system also for leveling
[3:10:09] slackstacker: i miss old talent tress
[3:10:16] KelpieAn: talent tree 🤔
[3:10:21] KyleEverett: For a combo levelling/end game system I like it

[3:11:43] KelpieAn: towHeh
[3:12:16] Alaquane: are you getting more than 1 piece of loot per boss?

[3:13:23] slackstacker: ya they could re release legion and id be satisfied. just minus the negerending conco4dance part
[3:14:00] KyleEverett: do alts even need to do the grinding or is everything in that account wide?
[3:14:07] slackstacker: i do like the crafting and professions though. idk how i feel about renown farming again
[3:14:09] Holgrim93: Anymore????
[3:14:13] Ezareal: Everything but profession stuff is account wide I believe?
[3:14:19] Dimebagz: Dimebagz subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 49 months! 
[3:14:31] KyleEverett: I know they said the cosmetics will be buyable account wide, but who knows about the rest

[3:15:29] Ezareal: Dragonscale Expedition/Valdrakken Accord each have Profession specific stuff, and then Iskaara/Centaur have some gathering things
[3:15:33] Ezareal: from what I saw
[3:15:37] chillydex: omg its a battle pass
[3:15:47] slackstacker: if i have to play like 3 toons daily. i def will wait u til s3/s4 or next xpac after dflight

[3:16:06] slackstacker: wait for the catch up system
[3:17:20] slackstacker: imagine switching proffesions and having to refarm renown. ill just find the cliff lol
[3:17:23] TimmayHS: there's a larger gap than that I think, between being a 1%er and being fully casual
[3:17:30] Arawn67: I mean they had to add the inta 60 renown token for shadowlands so I have no idea why they think not making this account wide is a good idea lol
[3:17:50] AthenaP47: how to the profession specialization/points work? can you learn everything? or is there a limited number of points to spread out
[3:17:57] slackstacker: i stopped playing in s2 of slands. renown was just terrible
[3:18:04] KyleEverett: "metrics"
[3:18:35] slackstacker: i mean we say they know. but than they give us HOV for M+ Kappa
[3:18:55] hgizaira: Do the zones not have music yet?
[3:18:57] KyleEverett: They're massively nerfing HoV and I'm excited for it
[3:19:28] Valathrian: hello! Is M+ out on beta DF?
[3:19:28] Moobot: I will be leveling a toon on the NA Fresh Server Maladath (Normal) 8/30. 3-4 Day Mini-Thon for Launch. Gonna hit Max Level and get some quick gear!
[3:19:35] slackstacker: if they made tabards so i can just do M+ or raid and not do dailies for renown. id be happy again
[3:19:51] slackstacker: or well not happy but more inclined to maybe play wow
[3:20:05] Crowdn: for someone who does not care about professions, this is not an issue
[3:20:30] slackstacker: this xpac you will care @crowdn you will.
[3:20:39] GingerPurple: Make tabards great again
[3:20:57] KyleEverett: Maybe the way they scaled it up to 70 was making things bonkers
[3:21:19] slackstacker: not even great. just relegant again @gingerpurple and not make it a cosmetic
[3:21:19] TimmayHS: they probably need to nerf everything since they're scaling rewards to +20, especially for s01
[3:21:56] slackstacker: HOV getting nerfs because they remebered there was no target cap, item switching in dungeon and tankntrinkets for hyrja lol

[3:21:58] TimmayHS: Oh yea, super exciting for m+ players and people who like both
[3:21:59] KyleEverett: Eh, the blue post implies they want the best loot to be harder to get, but we'll see if they commit to making it harder.
[3:22:13] Vaalkast: even less
[3:22:17] NiteshadezTV: you personally liking how the prot pally or warrior play?
[3:22:22] NiteshadezTV: more*
[3:22:25] Ezareal: Brackenhide as a boomkin is so fun
[3:22:33] Vaalkast: i usually go for the 0.1% m+ title and it doesnt really affects it
[3:22:35] TimmayHS: id say they should even have another tier at +25 for a couple more ilvls to reward those players
[3:23:00] slackstacker: M+ highest gear is still H level right? aside from weekly cache?
[3:23:01] Valathrian: 4 set on DH vengeance looks broken
[3:23:31] Ezareal: M+ Highest gear is 421 from vault and 412 possibly for valor upgrade I believe
[3:23:40] KyleEverett: They've raised the highest key reward before in the past and eventually 15s became easier than a legion 10
[3:25:16] TimmayHS: i think it's totally fine that some people that only want to do 15s are receiving gear that isn't the max. I think it's way better for the game
[3:25:24] KyleEverett: One thing I'm curious about since they want m+ to be more like mythic raiding, and we won't see these dungeons again for 6 months or ever again in DF if they'll start nerfing m+ like the raid.
[3:25:40] ashmigle: so, m20 is easy like m15 shadowland?
[3:25:49] KyleEverett: @TimmayHS Those of us who were doing 15s for the gear will just find a way to do 20s unless they're impossible for them.
[3:26:05] LawlessManiac: Is this the standard new UI? or have you used addons? because it looks freaking cleaaan

[3:26:13] KyleEverett: @ashmigle we have no idea what final key tuning will be.
[3:26:17] llNoTToXiCll: elvui
[3:26:26] Ezareal: its default UI
[3:26:38] llNoTToXiCll: @LawlessManiac  i believe on the ptr you can test the new ui
[3:26:49] llNoTToXiCll: i thought it was elvui
[3:27:00] Ezareal: nah this is the new default
[3:27:09] llNoTToXiCll: thanks for the crrection
[3:27:31] llNoTToXiCll: but anyways yeah you can test the new ui in ptr tho @LawlessManiac
[3:27:38] LawlessManiac: kinda too busy playing WOTLK to check it out, but if it is elvui i might use it for WOTLK too
[3:27:48] KyleEverett: It was nerfed
[3:27:53] llNoTToXiCll: no its not elv ui
[3:27:57] llNoTToXiCll: i got corrected
[3:28:05] LawlessManiac: sad
[3:28:16] Valathrian: Rouge!
[3:28:25] llNoTToXiCll: Anyways if you want to see it i told you where to go
[3:28:38] LawlessManiac: yeah thanks, the deffo improved it!
[3:28:39] KyleEverett: Dungeon changes I've noticed this build are the two new dragons in Life Pools, they added a bunch of trash to the last part of Neltharus, and removed needing 2 cages here
[3:29:46] Rev_4_Life: cages is a great change here it feels like this part drags
[3:29:47] KyleEverett: 7 may still be too long but no pressure since it's not an s1 key
[3:30:00] LoneViper88: LET HIM GOTO SLEEEP
[3:30:08] LoneViper88: HE NEEDS IT
[3:30:17] Valathrian: would have been nice for beta to have option to instant lvl to 70 on alts when u reach 70 on main
[3:30:23] BigQonU: Is Thundering really as bad as everyone is saying?
[3:30:33] KyleEverett: @BigQonU I'd say yes
[3:30:42] BigQonU: oh dear
[3:30:44] KyleEverett: it's... doable but it's not fun at all
[3:31:30] BigQonU: I wish affixes weren't a thing at all. I know it's basically the entire point of M+ but
[3:31:39] slackstacker: iif you did the legion raid on mythic. the last boss on the ship where you have to run with balls shooting out of you and stuns. just imagine it every 1 min and 15 secs. its not fun lol
[3:31:54] SarcasticDibbs: Hows m+ been I just got here.
[3:32:40] slackstacker: if they got rid of fortified and tyranical itd be fine
[3:32:47] KyleEverett: There's only one non kiss-curse affix people liked and that was reaping
[3:32:55] KyleEverett: Infested and Beguiling was hated
[3:32:59] BigQonU: At least bring back badges to dungeons as another form of gear acquisition!
[3:33:29] Rev_4_Life: the only real kiss curse in SL was season 1, the rest were really kiss imo
[3:33:29] slackstacker: infested was great. cc 4 mobs. pull big and kill it or everything heals to full it was great lol
[3:33:32] qu4ntum786: is seasonal affix only on certain servers?
[3:33:45] LoneViper88: wow indeed... proved alolt...
[3:33:47] fryd13: How is dungeon spam for leveling?
[3:33:50] BigQonU: I would assume its on all servers

[3:37:35] BigQonU: are professions genuinely going to become separate content to focus on or probably not?
[3:37:51] vendetta153: yeah addons for plus 10yrs its hard to go back, I might give it a go though
[3:38:04] Jewishraver: Hows prot warrior treating you? @Towelliee
