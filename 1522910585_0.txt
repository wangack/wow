[1:19:55] realnzall: @fastboy42069 Power Infusion. It's a priest spell that gives 20% haste to a friendly target. It's controversial because priests want to keep it for themselves but it's actually better to toss it on a bunch of other DPS

[1:28:27] The_Farting_Spaniard: Id be surprised if they kept the release date
[1:28:30] nephttv_: i'd rather a delayed xpac just for the twitch content

[1:28:35] manmower: players will swear off dragons forever

[1:29:23] mmrghost7: i mean they should have just said it will be 2023 from the start of prepurchase
[1:29:27] Rottencoarse: @NieIas  oh yeah lmao

[1:29:55] Alepouditsa: i won't buy it anyway the made it 50 euros when it was 40 last time if i buy it it will be on sell the is no reson to up the price on a sub game
[1:30:10] lithium364: im excited for the animated dragonflight shorts, these are always sooo good
[1:30:15] Syllvn: @mmrghost7 in some countries they cannot do prepurchase if a product isn't out in the same year I believe
[1:30:16] Armdel: still, why not pick a safer date range in Q1 or Q2 2023 instead
[1:30:31] tumtillion: Good morning chat and @towelliee
[1:30:45] manmower: invite him if he'll give you a cut
[1:30:46] dwolf010: they wont go with a wrong date tho. they do believe can do it otherwise they would just have said 2023

[1:31:33] NieIas: but they could have said on or before march 2023
[1:31:34] AveragePvp: I mean Dk
[1:31:43] kuggerkug: im just confused with all the new rules, wouldnt want to get banned
[1:31:43] Eithos87: eu requires the game to come out same year as preorder
[1:31:49] realnzall: @Towelliee I think a delay would be better. I don't want another Christmas raid tier
[1:32:15] Pannekaker: And they're not gonna lose anything by delaying either
[1:32:35] mmo_kenna_: Yo hammer squad, DF alpha today?!?
[1:32:41] realnzall: I mean, if Liquid can keep it together this time...
[1:32:45] Pannekaker: What you gonna do, refund and buy it two months later?
[1:32:54] theszoti: tbh blizzard doesn't really cares much about wether the tier is during christmas or not
[1:33:11] RolexKT: At MOST 1% would refund, people can threaten all they won't but they wont
[1:33:52] Heavuh: Didnt blizz just buy a company and add them to the dev team
[1:34:02] theszoti: OR they release the expansion in december but the tier will only start in the new year
[1:35:23] Armdel: @Heavuh they did, but that team probably won't be ready to do any real work for months
[1:35:31] realnzall: @Towelliee I'm looking forward to the next M+ season. Much prefer the more passive "lasts the entire dungeon" effects over things like Prideful or Encrypted that fizzle if you have a bad pull
[1:35:50] manmower: maybe they're the paid fall guys in case it is delayed
[1:36:54] medanmarko: I'm gonna talk out of my ass and say that they will touch the first piece of WoW code in about 6-9 months. MAYBE.

[2:43:22] Jalapinot: @SneakySquiddz If you want to play Wrath, now is a fantastic time to start in Classic
[2:44:04] SneakySquiddz: @jalapinot so you recommend playing classic and not Shadowlands?

[2:45:22] Nevindaz: what if they add m+ in wotlk ? GandalfPls

[2:46:15] Scoodles91: if i have to search half an hour for a dung, i aint doing it
[2:46:18] TheCliffyShow: Blizzard are just going to have Dalaran move every expansion.
[2:46:18] Villie: i mean why not just have it fly around with us every expansion
[2:46:19] SneakySquiddz: @jalapinot cool thanks

[2:46:29] DeanoTV: people actually believing it KEKW

[2:46:41] amazulu_: LFD so much better than this half-baked system
[2:46:53] MrGharr: @SneakySquiddz classic is slow paced, SL is faster paced with QoL, depends on your preferences. You could check out SL season 4 at max level to try out the raids and dungeons.
[2:46:53] kekdubbb: one big reason im not playing wrath classic is no LFD. 2 year old\... full time job.. would rather just insta queue into dungeons
[2:46:54] pealladk: instead of making a new hub they copy dalaran again?
[2:46:56] pealladk: dumb
[2:46:56] najra1989: @Scoodles91 Ye i agree. If searching takes more time than doing the actual dungeon. Its a no go for me.

[2:51:42] PadidinJones: @Towelliee honestly I think the devs simply wont have LFD because they dont want to maintain it. It does take alot of resources to run im sure

[2:53:09] Moobot: Plans for WOTLK Beta. Some simple leveling and helping Blizzard test. At first there won't be a lot of people to do content with. That will change when 80 Template comes into play. OH and I don't have Beta keys ask Panda

[2:59:20] DeanoTV: dead servers? ur smoking LUL
[2:59:30] Sephirothxz: @besteverythingkr lets suppose player count is under one mill thats very unlikely imagine 1 m player paying for a sub do you think its not enough to mantain a game? LUL

[3:00:05] besteverythingkr: I mean you could just laugh at my opinion instead of providing your own, usually that means your triggered and you have no clue what ur talking about

[3:01:21] rusty414: @Broomba what crap.. MS bought blizz why is it not in realm of possibilities

[3:15:35] pronkk_: my issue is this looks fun, but having not played classic before and having no gold/friends, i would have a hard time getting here
[3:15:53] thilgan12: Just buy gold. You‚Äôll make friends
[3:16:00] zorkxzx: are the talents and skills wotlk?
[3:16:00] mmo_kenna_: they adding fresh servers
[3:16:14] Kinghorn: nah pronkk11 new expansion means an even playing field except for the gold issue
[3:16:24] Kinghorn: you could go on a fresh server
[3:16:31] tronbadgames: did you double copy your toons for gold?
[3:16:51] jasonbriggs: did you hear about the guy who got shot 60times by police?
[3:17:15] tronbadgames: nice
[3:17:21] amazulu_: I 5x copied my characters for gold cap
[3:17:43] tronbadgames: @Towelliee yeah, i think the play is dungeon spam > quest at 80, should have flying and then some
[3:17:50] thilgan12: Is there dual spec in beta?
[3:17:54] HaxzorJimDuggan: regular flying for sure, fast flying is iffy just from quest rewards

[3:19:09] ossejo1: yeah
[3:19:13] oogi3boogi3: should have it
[3:19:23] ScrubGamerPOV: Sup Towel and chat. I was able to snag WoW Shadowlands Epic edition for pretty good deal. You think I should start off by playing WoW Classic Burning Crusade or Live version?
[3:19:24] silodin: Are ability ranks still a thing? or do you just use the highest rank in wrath?
[3:19:26] LongSnapper99: Yeah they do
[3:20:08] Vanhoek: @silodin no downranking in wrath all ranks cost the same mana
[3:20:23] ossejo1: @silodin Only for faster cast time I believe, mana should be the same for all ranks
[3:20:23] vyjinx: does the dk have have frost presence active?
[3:20:37] LiteraceAD: wait... do i see 2 seals??

[3:20:44] HotHotHeals: Thats a gamer
[3:20:49] thilgan12: @noobmmogamer just depends what you want to do. If you want to play wrath when it comes up you should start preparing a character in classic. Retail is pretty dead right now in between seasons/next expansion but it‚Äôs still a good time.
[3:21:01] silodin: @Vanhoek That is realy good news. thanks
[3:21:26] keknrekt: dont you need 80 to enter heroics?
[3:21:41] Deadlegacy1337: no
[3:21:44] ScrubGamerPOV: Thank you @thilgan12   Think I‚Äôll start up a Mage Class. Was playing the Live version and got hooked. Lol.
[3:21:52] kekdubbb: by preparing a char in classic, you mean attempting to get raid drops? cause itll be pretty tough at this point in the expac unless you have gold for GDKP
[3:21:57] thilgan12: Nice! Enjoy mage is a blast
[3:22:11] dalaraz: the ranged struggle with los is so funny :p

[3:22:48] CritcobainTV: Mount drop time FeelsGoodMan
[3:22:49] dalaraz: feral gear pog
[3:22:50] Deadlegacy1337: lets go PogBones
[3:22:51] Kinghorn: that is a lot of expertise
[3:22:53] thilgan12: Preparing would be leveling professions, getting max level, getting some gear. It‚Äôs not impossible to get into a guild that will help gear you a bit or do badge runs of kara, t5 raids
[3:22:59] jasonbriggs: all last bosses drop epics on heroic
[3:23:01] keknrekt: @Deadlegacy1337 all you have to do is just walk in? with any lvl or gear?
[3:23:08] grumpnamedjosh: I can‚Äôt imagine being 75 doing Heroics is XP efficient.

[3:25:19] mmo_kenna_: yes and the gauntlet

[3:26:02] Obidal: Hope the Tanking sword drops in UP for you ;) First epic i got on my prot back in Wotlk. I fucking loved it. That paired with the shield from the stratholme dungeon
[3:26:07] thilgan12: I remember struggling the most in pit of saron when I first hit 80
[3:26:38] jasonbriggs: should update auto
[3:27:12] mmo_kenna_: pit of saron came out when we were fully raid geared so yeah proba hard for fresh 80
[3:27:25] Timothious: turn off show all spell ranks then if the man is same?

[3:37:50] silodin: That's fair, keep it for 80's
[3:38:07] Timothious: taking the 80s gear before they get 80 lol
[3:38:16] HotHotHeals: oh so you can do heroics before 80. thats odd man
[3:38:18] Vanhoek: Why tho it doesnt effect anyone if you get your gear at 77 cause your geared enough to do so or if your 80 doing it? lol
[3:38:24] s10g0d: can't wear the gear until 80 though, right?
[3:38:43] clambynature: @towelliee did you say hammer of FU your face?
[3:38:43] Moobot: Plans for WOTLK Beta. Some simple leveling and helping Blizzard test. At first there won't be a lot of people to do content with. That will change when 80 Template comes into play. OH and I don't have Beta keys ask Panda
[3:38:46] Deadlegacy1337: Yeah
[3:38:46] Vanhoek: Peopel were full kara geared before they hit 70

[3:39:23] Ertra: lol you just give up and let the DK tank?
[3:39:26] Fepersz: is the new LFG tool working?
[3:39:59] Vanhoek: But than again I dont think anybody would stop to do heroics on their mains since the xp/h would be terrible. Alts being carried tho thats another thing
