[4:59:11] Drast: Had atleast 1 character on seperate computer with AHK spamming kick on Devilsaur until it spawned KEKW
[4:59:57] Motelguy: monkaW
[5:00:07] Drast: fucking ned man
[5:00:28] Motelguy: These days, you get banned if you kill bots KEKL

[5:00:55] Nightbot: Dalvsali and Pilla are Dali's newest alts on Classic Era. The plan is to ultimately use the warrior as a GDKP alt. The Paladin solely exists to healbot the warrior, no plans to raid on it.
[5:01:25] Motelguy: What are thoughts of a permanent TBC server
[5:01:29] Ranzorx: How’d the raid go? I was gymming
[5:01:38] Completetripod: for now
[5:02:18] Chernobyl26: Where's my Perma-SoM server
[5:02:24] xCharg: tbc is too linear, once you're at the end of the corridor - there's literally nothing to do
[5:02:41] xCharg: vanilla isnt that linear and wrath at least have achievements - at least something
[5:02:45] fn_rd: tbc was fun but im not doing those rep farms again
[5:03:31] Drast: zanza OneHand
[5:03:42] Nightbot: Dali's Classic era FAQ: https://tinyurl.com/26ywenp6
[5:03:56] itsurewantme: all expansions should have a ERA server, theres no place to play tbc now except private servers
[5:03:59] Drast: Swiftness zanza is officially dead now that cata is being released
[5:04:10] R_GraM_: engi teleporter for bigger hitbox LUL
[5:04:27] serenityee: its gonna be the new light of elune
[5:04:33] Drast: stock up your mailbox
[5:04:37] Drast: 365 days
[5:04:54] Drast: should be doable, 1 at a time
[5:05:07] Drast: It used to be doable atleast
[5:05:15] Drast: because you would moll-e and pick it up
[5:05:34] Whitty: they also don't want to completely split player base
[5:05:45] simonromlie: TBC priv always dies pretty fast  so
[5:05:47] drioplays: TBC is a one and done expansion. i don't think it's replayable
[5:05:47] R_GraM_: too late now with ppl not being able to clone imo
[5:05:58] panjack13: TBC is literally the middle child
[5:06:11] xCharg: @Whitty its already split - era, wrath, discovery, retail
[5:06:13] turbogamergod: parsing in tbc heroics LUL
[5:06:13] Nightbot: Parsing? Really? If you think I'm going to worry about parsing, then you're right. What will my friends and family think about my parses? They're going to say, "we're proud of you."
[5:06:19] Ranzorx: There never was a consistently solid tbc private server
[5:07:21] drioplays: i think TBC was the most fun i had but not replayable
[5:07:40] xCharg: in 8 years or so i'd play again :D
[5:07:40] DhorubaWoW: TBC was a lot of fun, I'd play it again, but I'm not holding my breath for it or anything
[5:07:46] Motelguy: TBC feels like a blur
[5:08:08] R_GraM_: took a while to gear in tbc
[5:08:24] R_GraM_: classic if had world buffs u we’re good even if gear was kind of scuffed
[5:08:25] Whitty: @xCharg how would adding additional servers not make it more split lol
[5:08:26] DhorubaWoW: @R_GraM_ that depended on the class, gearing an enha was comfy excluding the weapons
[5:08:37] DhorubaWoW: and even the weapons were fine if you did arenas
[5:08:47] R_GraM_: yeah

[5:08:55] dd_lee: Vanilla is easy (i.e., accessible) and reward preparation and knowledge rather than mechanical skills like reflection
[5:08:57] xCharg: @Whitty it will, i meant that "they dont want to split" is weird to say because they already split it
[5:09:21] Motelguy: monkaW
[5:09:22] Midiosa: we hear nothing
[5:09:24] Whitty: @xCharg you missed the word "completely" as in it's already split
[5:09:27] DhorubaWoW: NotLookingAtBooba
[5:09:29] Whitty: but yeah we agree
[5:09:31] Canwestop: Susge
[5:10:44] Motelguy: Stand out of fire mechanics EZ
[5:10:47] panjack13: The attune process in TBC was annoying
[5:10:53] xCharg: one bad thing about tbc is that it's right about time when you FEEL speedrunning literally dying and everything morphs into "do current raid 10 times a week on every character", a grind
[5:11:39] panjack13: Yeah that was nice
[5:11:49] xCharg: no cheeky pulls or weird strategies - everyone does everything the same way, boring
[5:12:00] Midiosa: streamer, do you have any interested in palworld?
[5:12:15] ekiprkl: @SalvDali what was the worst thing about TBC?
[5:12:28] DhorubaWoW: speedrunning only became inaccessible at SWP, up to then it was pretty lively
[5:12:37] Motelguy: Ulduar prison NotLikeThis
[5:13:08] itsyowboi: Everyone lied through their nostalgia when they said ulduar was the best raid blizzard ever made
[5:13:11] itsyowboi: It was a scam

[5:14:23] Canwestop: shaman stacking xd
[5:14:38] R_GraM_: group buff meta
[5:14:47] R_GraM_: needed the Orlando group to pump
[5:15:00] Motelguy: Windfury totem nerf Sadge
[5:15:09] Whitty: double lust hunter stack was fun
[5:15:15] xCharg: @itsyowboi the fear of missing out screwed us huh
[5:15:19] DhorubaWoW: and the 5 or 10 yard range on green drums was CANCER
[5:15:25] turbogamergod: every single pug reserving dst
[5:15:33] panjack13: Yeah vanilla attunements are pretty good
[5:15:33] DhorubaWoW: having to spam group chat with a WA telling people drums off CD in 10s
[5:16:07] bromanda_theblur: in my dad guild my buddy got talked to for his dps being bad when he always got put in the pleb group they were idiots
[5:16:16] DhorubaWoW: the problem was the giga short range on the early version of drums
[5:16:17] panjack13: For me it was learning about defense cap the hard way in a heroic dungeon
[5:16:24] xCharg: dont forget spending 10 minutes spaming LFM 4/5 need tank :D
[5:16:54] eorkern: !alts
[5:16:54] Nightbot: Dalvsali and Pilla are Dali's newest alts on Classic Era. The plan is to ultimately use the warrior as a GDKP alt. The Paladin solely exists to healbot the warrior, no plans to raid on it.
[5:17:06] Magnoks: if the tbc attunes were account wide it would be fine
[5:17:08] DhorubaWoW: farming shadow labs for 12 hours to get the expertise ring on your 3rd alt Despairge
[5:17:33] panjack13: Woot
[5:17:35] yoooofi: ez
[5:17:40] DhorubaWoW: EZ

[5:19:27] DhorubaWoW: was big for enha also
[5:19:39] R_GraM_: had to get it on ret ya
[5:20:30] ekiprkl: it doesn't matter how good they make ret
[5:20:31] xCharg: and then you get it and then shaman from your group doesnt show up to raid and you're out of WF
[5:20:33] xCharg: KEKW
[5:20:33] ekiprkl: it's still cringe
[5:20:38] R_GraM_: the world ended when you missed on ret
[5:21:04] DhorubaWoW: i dunno, 80% of my damage was white hits and windfury procs, according to WCL
[5:21:07] turbogamergod: did you ever try sealtwisting in tbc
[5:21:23] yoooofi: EZ
[5:21:48] ekiprkl: never get GoA, get the RFK loot
[5:22:15] panjack13: have a nice day!
[5:22:15] R_GraM_: tbc ret was fun single target but ver sad on aoe
[5:22:21] angrychimpo_: tbh i already talk shit, but no one listens to me anyway
