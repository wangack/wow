[5:16:56] swankfunk: may I see your gear please @JokerdTV
[5:17:00] veiloflonelystars: it's very anti hunter
[5:17:09] NILLme: i play hunter to be a ranged class, not the other way around LUL
[5:17:10] viliev: mage healer warlock tank?
[5:17:10] uBm3D: you kite meles, but melee casters
[5:17:12] hir0k: hunter only class without defensive cds
[5:17:25] markrippetoe: u scared
[5:17:27] veiloflonelystars: melle weaving 2hand raptor strikes its good to finish players but besides that it sucks to go melle
[5:17:33] just_a_slayer: the problem isn't melee hunter, the problem is there is no supporting talents/skills to make the playstyle actually work - so it's just spam raptor strike
[5:17:36] viliev: mage healer and warlock tank doesnt make sense as well :D
[5:17:39] hailstormz: poison based range spec wouldve been better for hunter lore wise, melee is wack
[5:17:44] hejez: xpp

[5:18:26] wangchief: @JokerdTV i played only ranged for a long time, playing rogue in SoD, just getting up clsoe in pvp feels weird
[5:18:41] muchtar92: maybe you played warrior and know that you cant go in all the time
[5:18:50] Brelshar: Harpoon has verticle movement as well
[5:18:56] veiloflonelystars: ye its pretty much pve only
[5:19:01] McAllister7: Payo was doing an open world melee hunter but it was only possible when wyvern sting was off cd
[5:19:01] ZuhaibRPG: I really depends on the comp you are facing but generally melee hunter is not the best
[5:19:02] muchtar92: melee hunter is a pve spec
[5:19:02] mitchello85: what is the point in waylaid supplies after reveared??? seems to give nothing and reveared also nothing for my pri ench/tailor
[5:19:05] veiloflonelystars: rogue and warrior are just so much better as melles
[5:19:09] 79trdude: in the current shadow/boomkin and other caster meta youre just soaking the dmg as any melee
[5:19:13] nomak2018: take fligth?
[5:19:16] Demobalderes: Melee hunter has like 0 defensives compared to all other melee classes, and you're mail
