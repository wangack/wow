[2:53:26] Versher777: Is Towelliee streaming?
[2:53:27] kingdaddy96: That wasn't the play call. That was trubisky. The go routes were only there to stretch the field and maybe get a defensive hold call. 🤣
[2:53:52] saulowolff: G
[2:53:53] Aphro_Samurai: i stand corrected. 3rd and 2 deep ball play. 4th and 2 deep ball play from your own 49 yard line
[2:54:25] Aphro_Samurai: still 3rd and 2 and 4th and 2 you dont throw the ball deep and you prob should be running go routes with your backup qb
[2:54:59] kingdaddy96: Yeah it was just bad
[2:55:10] Aphro_Samurai: run a hitch, a quick out, hell a bubble screen, and RPO , a HB Screen. ANYTHING but a go route..
[2:55:33] kingdaddy96: Almost as bad as the offsides penalty they called a false start. 🤣
[2:55:46] Aphro_Samurai: Hell run the ball. thats still a better option than the 2 deep balls
