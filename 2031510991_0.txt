[0:57:42] StreamElements: Check out the Best VPN Surfshark -> https://surfshark.deals/SavixVPN
[0:57:42] ashe00s: it should be daily q or 2 times per week
[0:57:42] Tomfromuk: its hardly min/max, just a buff you could use so people would want to use it make a run smoother
[0:57:44] misomander: only works in ashenvale like the mount
[0:57:49] nickylas: my only hope is that bfd and ashenvale buff DO NOT work next phase

[0:59:49] misomander: i just pray the gnomer buff is in ironforge where the alliance belong TOOBASED
[0:59:49] dapps231: world buffs gotta go
[0:59:54] asnowgoose: world buffs are stupid
[0:59:56] Giraffipus: they should just take out all but the phase buffs so its 3 max or so per tier
[0:59:58] Kurama__95: Fricking minmaxers savixOld
[1:00:03] succaw: even if they dont trying to get bfd buff in phase 2 gonna be rough as not many people gonna be doing bfd

[1:01:12] NyndokeSama: I just want good PvP
[1:01:13] ginjakk: in som with no world buffs guilds required every juju, every blasted lands consume, flask, firewater, run, every single consume and that was way worse than collecting buffs imo
[1:01:19] KrotonGG: I love pumping with my new gear!
[1:01:19] rustyjeep: recommend some watch how OGJeffrey plays and give that a shot sometime.
[1:01:20] alpacabowldood: ya my guild tries to clear as fast as possible

[1:05:20] KroocsMD: that’s the giga brain of a 99 parser EZ
[1:05:22] pimpdaddyping: not true lol
[1:05:24] funboix0x0: Saddies
[1:05:27] Kira_Corpse: this is a 99 parser om
[1:05:27] airvortex3: @Hoshma46 hiii
[1:05:29] Toastedyogurt: they just got 2 buffs
[1:05:43] Zashooo: they are just too strong in pv
[1:05:45] Zashooo: pvp
[1:05:47] Deadge_Gartic: pure dps class should pump tbh
[1:05:48] misomander: the eyes of the beast shit was just dumb as fuck
[1:05:50] trlme: BabyRage my pet cant 3 hit every player anymore
[1:05:50] Giraffipus: rogue is doubling some peoples top dps time to nerf hunter
[1:05:51] alpacabowldood: they just need to buff other hunter builds
[1:05:53] Naboo69: savixOld fuck em
[1:05:55] Norcore: beast mastery rune is still better than chimera
[1:05:59] Kurama__95: om
[1:05:59] SmugAlana: om
[1:06:01] Fourside_yL: as a hunter: yes pets are OP in pvp, but we just get lashed in pve
[1:06:02] achilees17: Hunters are still fine
[1:06:04] Hoshma46: keking
[1:06:05] rustyjeep: hunters always get nerfed.   predictable as the sun coming up tomorrow.
[1:06:11] oneexport: oh wow 1-2% buff
[1:06:12] epilepticunicorn_: the "buff" doesnt matter
[1:06:14] KaizeeRx: Copege
[1:06:18] Trainingtobeperson: 2% buff for MM
[1:06:20] KaizeeRx: bro would go beast mode if pala
[1:06:21] KaizeeRx: would get nerfed
[1:06:23] epilepticunicorn_: its still way too week to be relevant
[1:06:25] Giraffipus: it wasnt a buff. its still a huge loss to take off that rune.
[1:06:25] Exusprime: I take Hunter players opinion with a large pinch of salt
[1:06:26] funboix0x0: If MM gets buffed too much, we all go line wolf
[1:06:26] achilees17: It's still good
[1:06:31] danbalanceltrist: well investing 3 runes + talents kinda justifies the pet being stronger
[1:06:32] itsNitroNK: hunter still does less than half the damage compared to pet lol
[1:06:33] MonsieurPuppy: We deserved the nerfs, I just wish we had more utilities at this phase, and make more viable the class fantasies they want us to try out (melee, not pet...)
[1:06:34] Solloway: cat still destroys
[1:06:38] misomander: the actual player was the pet KEKL the hunter's pet was the main character
[1:06:39] darthterac: i love what you do for the trans community TransgenderPride
[1:06:51] pimpdaddyping: i think the 10% nerf on hp and dmg is fine focus shoulda stayed though. and the buff was only like a 2-3% dmg increase
[1:06:54] shingoshango: @savix I think the priest nerf was warranted…but they should have waited to 40 bc who knows how things will shake out
[1:06:58] goochyboi: bladestorm at 40
[1:06:59] goochyboi: lets goo
[1:07:02] LyteGod: Savix lost a 1v1 to my pet in like 20 seconds LULW
[1:07:04] rustyjeep: so why isnt warrior getting nerfed by this logic?
[1:07:05] Beastonian: Pally has utility
[1:07:06] Yngvarrior: Palas have lots utility
[1:07:07] nickylas: Flurry monkaS
[1:07:12] Madwo: savixJuice it is their destiny to be bad classes
[1:07:12] warningbell: better runes tho!

[1:07:49] trlme: Not everyone can be at first place Kappa
[1:07:50] Hoshma46: Kappa
[1:08:19] Kira_Corpse: i hadnt thought about it cuz i kinda find parsing in classic to be a snore (maybe when classes get more fun) but i actually hope they dont replace WB's and at some point you just have like 3 lines of buffs and the minmaxxers get what they wanted by just 1 shotting a boss
[1:08:24] xhavic: savixArrive
[1:08:40] CamGG__: have seen that a bunch in thunderbluff, I log in next day and its find no big deal
