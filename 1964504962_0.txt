[6:28:38] Draleric: cobaltNoted
[6:28:47] Carlsbergs: honestly, that jump is not worth saving the cost of a portal to darnassus, in my personal opinion
[6:29:12] Carlsbergs: It's not only a dangerous jump. It's a dangerous swim, too
[6:29:53] PolarPIaneT: just walk the 2 minutes
[6:29:57] PolarPIaneT: risk is not worth
[6:29:59] Draleric: KEKW
[6:30:01] PaperbackWritter: KEKW
[6:30:21] Ravenkorpse: lol buying a port to darn is way safer
[6:30:45] BlackRe3per: it's pretty easy to do
[6:30:50] BlackRe3per: you don't need to rebind
[6:30:53] DirtySnakeEyes: you could take the tram to SW, then take a boat to rut'theran iirc
[6:31:16] BlackRe3per: @DirtySnakeEyes there is not boat in Classic
[6:31:30] DirtySnakeEyes: oh, not even to menethil harbor?
[6:32:11] BlackRe3per: @DirtySnakeEyes nope there is no boat harbor in SW
[6:32:17] DirtySnakeEyes: walking truly is the final boss in classic.
[6:33:11] PaperbackWritter: Chatting
[6:33:21] PolarPIaneT: 40 is solo port

[6:36:06] DirtySnakeEyes: who builds *GNOMES* like that? DansGame
[6:37:33] DirtySnakeEyes: yeah, but imo, hc is a much more wholesome community. like you would be surprised how many people are just total bros in both city chat, and if u run into trouble out in the field.
[6:37:41] DirtySnakeEyes: its so neat.
