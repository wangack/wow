[0:47:58] liggles: Hydra - how do you feel about Aggrend's take that he is averse to adding RBGs in SoD due to them bringing in an expectation of balance they don't want to adhere to.   (imo fair enough, but just give it us and we'll/the pvp community accept it warts n' all?)

[3:17:52] ratslul: I really hope they make spriest good and they bring the humonc cuz its a really trash healing rune
[3:17:57] shiftbbg: void form
[3:18:03] DanUK_47: SP need much better dps so something to increase that id guess
[3:18:15] deanoxs: i would love the skeleton legendary from shadowlands Pog
[3:18:46] deanoxs: or imagine mindgames
[3:18:55] Sillithius: will you swap to shadow? or stay disc?
[3:18:59] ripinpeace10: i wish they would update devouring plague to wotlk one @Hydramist
[3:19:02] DanUK_47: Vampiric TOuch would be my guess
[3:19:28] ripinpeace10: not 3 min cd or w e it is
[3:19:35] ripinpeace10: its such a long cd
[3:19:39] ripinpeace10: and takes so much mana
[3:19:44] DeathToad007: its it just too much mana to use though?
[3:20:01] wreckedgum: serenity maybe
[3:20:34] ratslul: serenity is so niche its almost worthless
[3:20:38] DeathToad007: need some sort of mana regen passive as well
[3:20:41] ripinpeace10: spectral guise would be insane @Hydramist
[3:20:54] ratslul: might get one or two uses out of it per run and generally only if you run humonc
[3:21:52] cunderthuntz_: what runes do u run with to heal bfd
[3:21:55] deanoxs: or a glyph that changes mana to insanity
[3:22:30] ratslul: circle is amazing on kelris

[3:26:49] cunderthuntz_: what do u use on chest slot?
[3:27:37] ratslul: hes using void plague
[3:28:41] cunderthuntz_: what about running homies for armor debuff
[3:28:43] EruhiniTV: flash heal into heal
[3:28:47] cunderthuntz_: to let warriors pump more
[3:28:53] EruhiniTV: with cast rune
[3:28:56] EruhiniTV: on chest
[3:29:14] ratslul: yea kinda gotta use inner focus for the heal
[3:29:19] ratslul: other rip ur mana
[3:29:32] EruhiniTV: i use the bigger heal only with freecast so once a time
[3:29:55] EruhiniTV: better than nothing

[4:16:29] Zelimeth: u could stable him and get another pet to tame for skills
[4:16:53] Arjibhaji: Boar can be fun for charge kiting later on but phase is too bursty to make use of it I think

[4:28:16] Zelimeth: and switch it on and off
[4:28:16] onemanwoifpack: /petfollow
[4:28:25] husdis: I always have dhift wheel up attack and shift wheel back passive
[4:28:26] d_vanillagorilla: follow returns it
[4:28:29] Zelimeth: s-1 for on demand attaqck, c-8 / c-0 depending
[4:28:37] shiftbbg: spamming passive returns it
[4:28:44] WJBJR: passive means it will not attack anything by default, but if u want to be lazy, you can bind /petattack into one of your dam abilities
[4:28:53] WJBJR: you still need petpassive bind tho to make it come back
[4:29:10] Zelimeth: u can keep it on passive perma and just press s-1 and then s-2 to bring it back
[4:29:15] varatupaj: i used this in my hunter pet follow macro: /petfollow /petpassive
[4:29:44] Talgarx: chimera cranks now
[4:29:57] WJBJR: good you should have pet attack, pet passive, stay and unstay on separate binds
[4:30:03] Nightbot: Follow Hydra's twitter! https://twitter.com/hydramist
[4:30:21] WJBJR: for pvp mainly
[4:30:26] shiftbbg: not all that necessary but handy
[4:30:29] husdis: or DM runs at 60
[4:30:54] onemanwoifpack: you want /petfollow and /petattack
[4:31:06] WJBJR: its okay you will graduate eventually, hunter is super fun to min max in classic, you will want a range finder probably unless youre just gonna raw dog melee, deadzone, and ranged
[4:31:31] CARL_9000: if you are kiting, you can tell mr pig to stay until hes in range for a charge for the little stun :)
[4:32:18] SmiiLYOfficial: Hey Hydra, what would you say  i stronger Spriest or Warlock?
[4:32:31] Zelimeth: the next level is to bind charge and have it so u press it on demand. i think that's the case for when u get serpent too
[4:32:45] WJBJR: u definitely want to bind charge and not have it on autocast
[4:33:01] WJBJR: but i get it for leveling
[4:33:53] cruml: hey man i mailed that eagle +4 +4 wrist just like you asked Kapp
[4:34:42] WJBJR: so you need to tame a pet that knows bite rank 3 so that you pet has an actualy damage ability. boars dont have it by default, weirds classic systems
[4:35:20] iitsAK: are hunter
[4:35:21] EnigmaBob: !newvid
[4:35:21] Nightbot: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DT8n61Bgc60
[4:35:24] WJBJR: can i post a link
[4:35:33] WJBJR: https://www.wow-petopia.com/classic/abilities.php#bite3
[4:35:41] iitsAK: as easy as balance druid to level?
[4:36:51] WJBJR: its a short range too its weird
[4:37:00] shiftbbg: if pet attacks the food buff drops off him
[4:37:06] shiftbbg: doesnt get happiness
[4:37:20] Zelimeth: new zeroji
[4:37:26] WJBJR: maybe once you train a pet damage ability
[4:37:31] WJBJR: your pet has nothing trained
[4:37:33] CARL_9000: bicmex 2.0
[4:37:40] iitsAK: ye pet dmg and you are right up there with the best
[4:38:52] iitsAK: you havent made it until you can afk with your pet on agro and get some hks
[4:38:57] WJBJR: you should go to stonetalon and tame a level 16 spider so that your pet can train bite rank 3 and do some actual damage
[4:39:22] CARL_9000: just spam wingclip for fast weapon levels :D
[4:39:34] RyBurgo: just got my hunter to 25 and trying to work out what pet is best now. I’ve got the Grey Lion from the horn. are the thunder fucks still the best?
[4:39:39] Sinostra: Hey, i'm baack, did you get any luck in bfd ?
[4:40:06] Sinostra: next time then
[4:40:33] alexbilbaoo: Anyone has any clue why this macro doesnt work on enemies? #showtooltip /cast [@player,exists] [harm,exists,mod:shift] [@mouseover,help,exists] Dispel Magic Thanks
[4:40:35] felstavd: @RyBurgo  if u gonna PVP the serpent is best. if u gonna farm for open world etc its the lions from hillsbrad
[4:41:07] RyBurgo: @felstavd that go for BFD too?
[4:41:23] WJBJR: @alexbilbaoo you are casting at player, but requiring it to be harm?
[4:41:27] RyBurgo: is the Eurakwya or whatever he’s called no good?
[4:41:37] CARL_9000: I once got 4/4 zhevra hooves in a row
[4:42:06] felstavd: @RyBurgo if u gonna melee weave you should use a cat pet with 2.0 attackspeed otherwise 1.2 attackspeed any pet is OK for BFD
[4:42:29] RyBurgo: best part about hunter is you can solo the cobra legs. finally got mine today after like 10 goes
[4:42:45] RyBurgo: can probably solo it from level 22/23
[4:43:25] RyBurgo: @felstavd I will probably melee weave. I need to check it out on best rotations and such
[4:43:49] alexbilbaoo: @WJBJR I was thinking to have a dispell macro to dispell myself,dispell enemie with shift and mouseover allie instead of clicking it.
[4:43:52] RyBurgo: melee weave with dual wield or wait till BiS polearm
[4:44:01] shiftbbg: nah
[4:44:10] alexbilbaoo: Hunters mark is bis
[4:44:14] yaaksha: N it's like a DoT probably, if you kill them too fast it's not worth
[4:44:22] xSomeLameNamex: nah, only tougher enemies; elites and whatnot
[4:44:24] alexbilbaoo: U losing damage
[4:44:49] shiftbbg: just oom u
[4:45:19] felstavd: @RyBurgo I did melee weave instantly, doesnt matter so much I think
[4:45:27] felstavd: with 2 handed
[4:45:47] alexbilbaoo: If mobs die with 3 autos nah,otherwise i think its a must
[4:45:51] xSomeLameNamex: @alexbilbaoo you don't need it against normal mobs. most of the time won't make a difference b/t how many shots/hits you need; just taking your mana down.
[4:46:02] marsj0: Your pet has same health now as my full bis imp warlock
[4:46:49] poochgg: full bis 540 doubt it
[4:47:00] alexbilbaoo: @xSomeLameNamex Lazyyy hahaha Vibe
[4:47:11] xSomeLameNamex: ?
[4:47:24] iitsAK: @poochgg its a imp..what kind of hp you expecting?
[4:52:12] xSomeLameNamex: no flanking strike?
