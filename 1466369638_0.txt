They have an excellent 24/7 support team, supreme pc build quality and your PC will arrive at your house in a wooden crate!
[1:11:43] Jimstur: @Towelliee you will get alpha acces right? Will that be under NDA?
[1:11:54] mulkon: Hey @Towelliee you probably already answered this one million times but I never heard your thoughts, when do you guess we're getting alpha ?
[1:12:05] Moobot: you can figure out how long you've been following any channel by simply clicking on your own name in chat :)
[1:12:25] Jarlan23: cant you get 246 gear from the shards or whatever
[1:12:40] Jimstur: awesome. Cant wait to see you play it
[1:12:40] Jarlan23: that the rares drop
[1:12:44] y0rtek: you can but you never want to use non upgradable gear imo
[1:12:52] Kaype92: It’s easy @towelliee when you get your tier set you literally just press kill command when it flashes and hope to make your wildfire bomb flash. When wildfire bomb flashes you just click it. When you throw pheromone bomb (red bomb) you just spam kill command to fish for bomb procs and just press it.
[1:12:55] y0rtek: using the catalyst on 246 gear is a waste
[1:13:00] Jarlan23: thats what i heard yeah
[1:13:01] DannyBoyWho: @Towelliee do you think when Dragonflight launches the queues will be F'ed?
[1:13:01] Milanesa_De_Pollo: nope
[1:13:02] y0rtek: Sandworn Relics @Towelliee
[1:13:02] pronkk_: no
[1:13:02] Dyasis: no
[1:13:06] pronkk_: you cant
[1:13:09] Milanesa_De_Pollo: only the 246 sandworm gear
[1:13:15] levi_ooo: is it worth to use catalyat on 259
[1:13:32] Jarlan23: yea he 446 sandworm relics is what i meant
[1:13:35] y0rtek: you ideally want to use catalyst on gear that can be upgraded
[1:13:41] Jarlan23: 246*
[1:14:16] eakiller: wild spirits is the best ST covenant
[1:14:58] Jimstur: maybe it becomes bigger with conduits?
[1:15:14] BigD530: so M+ in 9.2.5, they're taking out the SL dungeons out of rotation, except for Tazavesh, right? or are they adding those other ones to the rotation?
[1:15:14] Moobot: World of Wacraft 10.0 Expansion LEAKED ON MAIN SITE! Could be deflection? Mebbe? THRE BE DRAGONS! https://www.wowhead.com/news/world-of-warcraft-dragonflight-expansion-leaks-on-blizzard-website-326583 We are doing a 24 stream for the expansion announcement. Be here!

[1:15:50] skymercii: @Easymode they pulled the ripcord
[1:15:52] Jarlan23: @Easymode its instant
[1:15:52] captiv8: you can just use WoWheads class guide for conduits and talent builds
[1:15:58] Jimstur: Are you not a littlebit sadge @Towelliee that you wont be able to play a big ass dragon tank? :p
[1:15:59] DommancsTV: Swapping covenants is so good rn
[1:16:01] Jarlan23: @Easymode but you still gotta level renown for em
[1:16:11] skymercii: ^
[1:16:17] BigD530: that would make sense given their "theme" for S4
[1:16:24] Easymode: oooh nice, that sounds good
[1:16:26] skymercii: also hai Towelliee
[1:16:38] ventu105: @Towelliee I beging playing TBC from 0 today lol
[1:16:40] MetalManGG: good morning Towelliee, hi chat
[1:16:51] Jarlan23: i understand why they didnt want another melee spec but 100% evoker shoulda had a tank spec
[1:16:54] Dagomarus: Do we know what the season 4 mount will be?
[1:16:57] DoubleNova: ah is there not a tank spec?
[1:17:00] Clotic_: Didn't they say they might open them up later on for other classes?
[1:17:02] Jarlan23: its a dragon dude it should have a melee spec even if its ranged
[1:17:05] Jimstur: @ventu105 make sure you pick a good server man with lots of people
[1:17:10] skymercii: how long we been on the 9-5 character?
[1:17:12] Jacorvin: I just hope pvp goes well. but this expac should really focus on scaling
[1:17:21] Nokterian: we havent had a new healer since MoP
[1:17:24] furiousee: cloth tank :)
[1:17:24] sunmx: black aspec should be tank
[1:17:27] DarkviperTV: cloth tank?
[1:17:31] CameronParadox: @ventu105 i wanna get back into wow but im far behind lol
[1:17:33] captiv8: i think they should have made survival hunter a tank spec
[1:17:38] levi_ooo: when is SL season 4
[1:17:38] skymercii: Cloth tank are mages
[1:17:41] Kalitvenec: towD laynaPantsu towPog
[1:17:44] Jimstur: Black dragon aspects just leans itself towards a good tank spec I feel
[1:17:44] Clotic_: ah
[1:17:44] DoubleNova: could other classes be open to more specs?
[1:17:54] simonbgg: Please jesus give me Tuskar allied races!
[1:18:10] Dagomarus: Sinces its only got 2 specs they have room to make a 3rd if they want to
[1:18:16] Jacorvin: Gimme rockbiter and tank spec and Ill consider tanking
[1:18:19] DarkviperTV: Yea tuskar allied race would be sick
[1:18:19] furiousee: bronze flight tank spec would be... interesting lol
[1:18:39] Jimstur: I am really curious how they will pull of the 'keep button pressed' spells. I hope it will be fun

[1:19:12] Jimstur: lost ark
[1:19:16] Jimstur: they do it pretty well I feel
[1:19:18] Nokterian: last tank spec was DH in legion
[1:19:19] Jimstur: the button pressing
[1:19:26] BigD530: similar to ESO charged spells
[1:19:37] Dagomarus: There will probably be some guide on icy or wowhead saying what the optimum charge is
[1:19:59] Attackroot: wildstarr charge up abilities plus extra  effects
[1:19:59] furiousee: will definitely be most interesting in pvp
[1:20:07] furiousee: probably op in pvp
[1:20:33] Synckery: guessing if its toggle-able then if you toggle it off then it always does the max charge
[1:20:34] Jimstur: if you can toggle it off it does not seem to have value at all to even put it in?
[1:20:46] sinjordan: Having a hard time of figuring out what to play as i get caught back up

[1:21:16] skymercii: yes u can
[1:21:18] Synckery: no you can kick it

[1:21:45] Jimstur: launch week will probably be bricked right. A week at least of trying to get in
[1:22:10] skymercii: does Dalaran have ques when expansions drop?
[1:22:13] Jarlan23: my server has like 10 different ones on it and its still medium pop
[1:22:14] KaanthEpsis: I remember Legion's launch being shockingly smooth, with the exception of that one DDOS but they can't account for 100% of that. Still a very smooth launch
[1:22:16] Dagomarus: Yeah problem wont be queues it will be sharding
[1:22:17] Jacorvin: towelliee confirms WoW dead game
[1:22:20] Jacorvin: xD
[1:22:21] svenskavelli: draenor launch, first experience of a new expansion, still haunts me to this day
[1:22:22] simonbgg: I wonder tho, if we'll be able to be more than 20 people at the same place in the open world without lag now when Borrowed powers are gone. :)
[1:22:30] Jimstur: oh man I am really exited for the new xpac AND wrath as well (if they put lfd back in:P )
[1:22:41] 12987346dust: Servers work smarter not harder
[1:22:43] furiousee: I remember everyone camping the first Poundfist spawn lol
[1:23:18] Jimstur: at least 30 ? xD probably 5 if people are dragon riding
[1:23:30] Jarlan23: i wonder what happened to make it lag so much. did it lag like that in legion?

[1:24:42] juniorgalindoa: i never played this game just 3
[1:24:53] juniorgalindoa: is it free ?
[1:25:02] Keydepleto: Hey tow, any estimation when 10.0 will come out, as live?
[1:25:19] y0rtek: I wonder if they're going to let us use dragon riding to go between zones or if we're getting the flight paths again
[1:25:19] Jacorvin: I think northrend just had a lot of open space
[1:25:25] Synckery: Northrend has 11 zones so it feels huge too
[1:25:30] Jimstur: I feel the zones in Shadowlands and BFA are so packed... there is so many things on top and next to each other I feel.
[1:25:47] ahies28: thats what she said
[1:26:00] Panasonic82: What's your first order of business once you hit max level? :)
[1:26:04] Wadjaah: Especially when you were a broke player with a 60% / 150% later on flying mount
[1:26:13] gooni_coyg: gz u just timed a 21 sanguine.. or my pet named Towelliee did :D
[1:26:20] sifer007: stormpeak bigger than shadowland
[1:26:29] Jimstur: Revendreth was horrible imho... My tiny brain could not handle finding my way up and down there.
[1:26:31] sunmx: u never "meet her" you just want a cinematic LUL
[1:26:54] Jimstur: REven is PRETTY, but I was so lost xD
[1:27:21] Wadjaah: Revendreth without flying was painful to navigate across
[1:27:28] BigD530: Coldarra should've been it's own zone rather than a "sub-zone" within Borean Tundra
[1:27:33] PvtHudson093: please no separated zones with one comunal hub city
[1:27:35] simonbgg: I hope they're together and not split up like SL! Feels more like a connected world :D
[1:27:44] xaeblue: oh it would be could to do the dive mechanics through each layer until you divebomb to 1st floor
[1:27:53] juniorgalindoa: whats max level?
[1:28:04] Jimstur: I hope they let us ride between all zones this time without a fake loading screen in between
[1:28:06] sinjordan: IDK WHAT CLASS TO PLAY
[1:28:37] juniorgalindoa: i like the double handed orc are they tuff here?
[1:28:48] i_cassius: Yo Towelliee just made BuZZ awesome mount
[1:28:49] Damingo54: Why is survival so good right now?

[1:45:42] kimmo_gaming: @Towelliee Thats why Bolvar is not in Dragonflight LOL
[1:46:09] Sniper_Penguin: not to mention everyone running around with the Dragonslayer title @Towelliee
[1:46:18] Jimstur: Blizz support is good inho. I boosted a char on the wrong server in TBC and they refunded me so I could make it on the right server.
[1:46:27] Wadjaah: 🤓 👆
[1:46:34] sLogOG: They connected dragon + evoker thing to lore pretty good in my opinion. I literally have 0 complaints.
[1:46:37] minael1: complainers will complain, @Towelliee
[1:46:42] smiley7878: yea have a genocide title now with the dragonslayer title
[1:46:44] KingSlayerYotam: I agree, if im a dragon, cant i transform into what ever i want?
[1:46:49] all_res_underscore: wtf cromie is a dude ?
[1:46:52] CrusaderNero: I want to be an undead that transforms into a dragon
[1:46:58] sLogOG: I love that we already knew Deathwing was working on a race like that for 20 years
[1:46:59] Jimstur: Game not released, not even in alpha, let's complain already.
[1:47:09] Svendv: yeah because the draktyr just looks bad LUL
[1:47:10] ZakuzaGB: Making a dragony version of EVERY race sounds like a fair undertaking
[1:47:32] Svendv: its more kind of a lizard
[1:47:38] sinjordan: Sent you a Tweet to show you my wallpaper if youd like to give it a look, pretty dope
[1:47:44] Akoudadis: they should do it like Last Ark. Transform into drake and fuck thigs up
[1:47:48] skymercii: some of the big wow streamers are calling blizz lazy for only makling the new class to 1 race.... im like damn yall dont waste anytime huh
[1:47:49] CrusaderNero: I agree with preach on this. Its a massive job to fit this class/race into all the established ones
[1:47:50] Colt_Engineer: *in fortnite voice* because @Towelliee I want my boobas
[1:47:55] Jimstur: I think it worked out for DH as well having a class/race combo
[1:48:07] Big_Rig_Sacrey: Alpha in may?
[1:48:08] CYNIC308: IMAGINE making a dragon class/race combo and there is no melee spec?! no bite no tailwhip no wing attack nothing
[1:48:09] y0rtek: ya'll ready to fight Denathrius again
[1:48:13] simonbgg: I Wonder If we get Tuskar as new allied race with their new updated models!
[1:48:22] kimmo_gaming: @Towelliee Because its in people's nature to shit on things before they try it
[1:48:35] xsp00n: because people will always whine, when they will just play FoTM anyways
[1:48:37] ILikeKillTheZombies: i mean monk was available for many races
[1:48:51] skymercii: @RoyDuran yes give me Daddy D moree
[1:48:51] lornthok: I just hope we will have the option to make them look more muscular
[1:48:54] CrusaderNero: monk is just drunken kung fu. easy to fit Kappa
[1:48:58] Jimstur: people just forgot how to have fun. Complaining is the new gaming nowadays.

[1:49:05] sLogOG: yeah but monks fit the fantasy @ILikeKillTheZombies
[1:49:09] xaeblue: i think its just the new concept of an entire race dedicated to one class even just for now. It could work tho
[1:49:13] Laudrana: DH was be/ne only tho
[1:49:13] Daddy_Platty: s
[1:49:27] ILikeKillTheZombies: im just saying that DH were limited to 2 races only and again we have it again
[1:49:35] xaeblue: I hear u
[1:49:42] CrusaderNero: im still making reddit treads about DH only being be/ne Kappa
[1:49:44] Jimstur: you can never please the masses. Too many different opinions
[1:49:48] skywolfieee: i'm just happy i can play my vulpera :P
[1:49:52] nihilistic_bat: People going to cry all the time
[1:49:59] lornthok: same
[1:50:00] Xanigh: im really excited for the new race/class
[1:50:02] sLogOG: yup same! i just love the idea behind tit
[1:50:06] Colt_Engineer: I wanted a tank personally, but I'm still happy lol
[1:50:11] sLogOG: it* not tit lol
[1:50:16] Big_Rig_Sacrey: Alpha in may?
[1:50:17] skymercii: people didnt complain about only 2 elves for demon hunters
[1:50:22] Qargory: how you guna explain how a vulpera is guna sprouts wings and start breathing fire?
[1:50:24] Gammit: I always thought they should have done that with worgen
[1:50:25] Svendv: the only part i think blizz is lazy on by making Timewalking in the main seasons of M+ instead of making more dungeons like we had in Legion for expample
[1:50:33] xsp00n: I think its just, people are fucking addicted, and it doesnt matter if they get what they want, they will still bitch about what they didnt
[1:50:34] smiley7878: is that the only class for that race or there others
[1:50:36] vincubus: I'm sure they'll either open up evoker to other races or possibly adding more classes to dracthyr down the line
[1:50:36] ILikeKillTheZombies: Yeah, but like you said before, you don't really care about new races or classes that much. there are groups of people more passionate about it :D
[1:50:37] DrakeDuude: I think they are not allowing it. cuz nearly everyone would change race lol
[1:50:39] CYNIC308: im fine with the race-class combo but why 2 specs and not a 3rd melee spec? its a DRAGON
[1:50:55] lornthok: yeah you can say that they were locked away on the dragon isles so they dont know how the other races actually look like
[1:51:05] kimmo_gaming: @Towelliee I mean their plan is to make evokers to be used by other races, but for now it is how it is, and people dont want to deal with it
[1:51:11] Jimstur: what is your take @Towelliee on the 4 new dungeon 4 old dungeon  mythic + rotation?
[1:51:26] ILikeKillTheZombies: I hoped that they would at least create a completely new model for visage image
[1:51:55] assman_ny: Oh bullshit, they will be there day one
[1:52:00] Jimstur: we are all going to play and we know it :D
[1:52:09] kimmo_gaming: @Towelliee Hello there, we are dragons, you want to be one?? come on in! LOL
[1:52:20] swervo61: i just dont see how people let stuff like that keep them up at night lmao

[1:52:41] Jimstur: I just know I will play every single expansion at least for a bit. Does not matter what they throw at me
[1:53:09] dankmeliodas: They need to thicken dracthyr up they look too goofy being so lanky
[1:53:18] Jimstur: people just like to drag on deez nuts
[1:53:29] xsp00n: roar of a dragon, not a dragon that is roaring
[1:53:45] garmin1987: garmin1987 subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 20 months, currently on a 1 month streak! 
[1:53:51] Jimstur: Monk fire breath dragon for sure 100%
[1:54:00] skymercii: yeah ive seen all over twitter "we have dragon roar" warriors need it
[1:54:07] Jarlan23: i want dracthyr to stay evoker exclusive so they can do some crazy animations with it
[1:54:09] CrusaderNero: @Jimstur dez nuts KEKW
[1:54:11] fwz94: i really hoped they would add more allied races.
[1:54:17] xsp00n: when Ion walks, hes draggin those big nuts on the ground, Drakthyr Ion confirmed
[1:54:26] Svendv: now my hunter can not only tame ferals but also evokers
[1:54:40] jaysteea: dragons with alcoholic addiction sounds good
[1:54:40] Jimstur: Oh man Ion... he looked soooo tired in the cinematic reveal. I felt sad for some reason
[1:54:59] Svendv: na not really
[1:55:02] Svendv: all pets are the same dmg
[1:55:08] dankmeliodas: More race options for existing classes would be nice.
[1:55:09] Svendv: only passives are different
[1:55:12] skymercii: ive heard some people call blizz " ballzy" cus this
[1:55:18] kimmo_gaming: @Towelliee It would be a cool feature that hunter tamed pets can be used as mounts
[1:55:51] Jimstur: the cuddle you at night
[1:55:52] Wadjaah: they fetch loot
[1:55:54] Jimstur: they*

[1:56:34] Jimstur: they tell you you look pretty :'(
[1:56:39] doubleOdan: i think they should add a lot more profession crafted mounts, 1-2 per xpac is kind of low
[1:56:52] CrusaderNero: DF feels like MoP and that makes me happy atleast.
[1:57:07] Dagomarus: They have been queueing up for dungeon finder for 10000 years waiting for a tank to come to the dragon isles
[1:57:10] CrusaderNero: I get the same vibe
[1:57:16] Jimstur: I get more of the Wrath feel... zone wise...
[1:57:34] Svendv: i like its not that dark etc but really bright
[1:57:36] sinjordan: Is ToF or a replay of storyline faster for leveling
[1:57:36] Svendv: i like that
[1:57:43] CrusaderNero: No main villain, lush zones, no systems. Out and explore!
[1:57:56] Stixxerz: got to be honest i only revived my account so i can play the new expansion they announced cuz that lured me back in
[1:57:56] Jimstur: @jordanm_2015 he started this char on a new account, so its not Tof
[1:57:56] fwz94: do you care if they add more allied races ? @Towelliee
[1:58:05] CrusaderNero: unless we suddenly gotta collect Dragon Ash Kappa
[1:58:17] sinjordan: im just asking for my case @Jimstur
[1:58:27] sinjordan: Lol i have a character but this is an alt
[1:58:40] Jimstur: oh @jordanm_2015 :D I usually go TOF and span dungeons and do some general quests in the zome

[2:13:53] ptcapitao: Wheres Khadgar?
[2:13:57] Jimstur: At least our favorite character Pelagos became the man! Said no one ever....
[2:14:00] Kisswani: We say that , but basically everytime we see Ursoc we kill him . maybe it's our fault
[2:14:12] ShadyDax: imagine this evoker getting a tank spec before we even get shaman tank spec Sadge
[2:14:21] kimmo_gaming: @Towelliee And they said Khadgar will be back in Dragonflight too

[2:15:57] Jessethoth: Sargeras will be depowered a bit and get his sword back, bet.
[2:16:01] ollievoll: whats sword?
[2:16:13] roronoa929: Illidan in my book is the #1 warcraft character.
[2:16:14] Kisswani: A splinter KEKW
[2:16:17] Im_a_sad_man: Its just a splinter LUL
[2:16:21] Jessethoth: I don't think the sword has any effect since the nullified it, but it probably would leave a direct entrance to something....way under AQ....
[2:16:22] Jimstur: the sword a.k.a. the splinter
[2:16:26] Bulldoc089: "it's just a splinter" Ion said
[2:16:32] fwz94: i really like trolls lore
[2:16:33] simonbgg: I guess you leave a splinter if you get it inside you haha
[2:16:34] szble: yeah idc about the sword
[2:16:37] fwz94: top in my book
[2:16:38] Colt_Engineer: "the world is healing" *giant sword in the palanet*
[2:16:43] Bulldoc089: but then we could also just remove it
[2:16:44] Jimstur: it is not THAT big Kappa
[2:16:47] Jarlan23: wasnt it the main story of bfa tho and now its just there with no conclusion
[2:16:47] Kisswani: to be fair , you dont just take out the sword , the whole zone has to be sort of redone
[2:16:49] Jessethoth: I feel like Azeroth herself will wield it and empower it with the Heart.
[2:16:51] dankmeliodas: Azeroth is gonna weird that shit when she hatches
[2:16:52] roronoa929: Hahahahaha
[2:16:55] xXsilverfoxXx: have the goblins, dissable it and turn it into armor
[2:17:02] Vezri96: WOOOONS
[2:17:05] MammothGB: Normally you cauterise it AFTER removing what's in the wound
[2:17:06] Jessethoth: But as far as the physical planet goes, it'll lead somewhere when she removes it.
[2:17:06] Jarlan23: except the biggest wound
[2:17:07] havenbirch: The woons
[2:17:08] dankmeliodas: *wield
[2:17:15] Im_a_sad_man: So the sargeras story ended fully in legion why dint they say in the first place LUL
[2:17:25] Tyrolore: "Ya need to heal the woons!"
[2:17:33] Jessethoth: @Danklobos I said wield
[2:17:42] Dagomarus: Yeah but which chad is gonna come along and just oh that looks painful let me just remove thar for you
[2:17:47] Kisswani: Who exactly do you suggest remove it anyway ? the dude who did this was bigger than the damn planet
[2:17:53] SpenceSir: Is it known if we'll have a covenant type system for the different dragon flights?
[2:17:54] dankmeliodas: @jessethoth I was correcting myself lol
[2:17:56] Kisswani: @Dagomarus yep
[2:18:11] Bulldoc089: the sword should also have some impact on the orbit or rotation of azeroth herself. big weather changes and stuff ^^
[2:18:13] Kisswani: KEKW
[2:18:13] Jessethoth: @Towelliee There's a lot of interesting ways they could write that, I don't think people are losing their minds, I think they're just super anxious to see where it would go, imagination you know.
[2:18:20] skywolfieee: splinter in a haystack
[2:18:36] Kisswani: it dissolved with the rain Kappa
[2:18:38] lornthok: yeah and they just lift it out and throw it into spacee
[2:18:43] clumsygun: blizzard just tries to gaslight 10million people: "what sword? there was never a sword"
[2:18:46] its_andyd: It might be gone right now
[2:18:49] Im_a_sad_man: I bet the gnomes pull it off with a giant forklift LUL
[2:18:49] el_cucuy_510: log into wow and it's wildstar
[2:18:51] minael1: trigglypuff all over again

[2:18:52] xendros78: remove it in a short story on the website
[2:19:03] Jarlan23: they should make it a rep grind where you help the gnomes and goblins dismantle the sword for materials

[2:19:11] VaineS_: they shouldve removed the sword for april fools
[2:19:18] Tjenne92: @SpenceSir Not for each diferent flight though. It's like a 5 in 1 rep thing
[2:19:18] Jessethoth: @Towelliee He gets on some meds, gets a therapist, has a heart to heart with the Pantheon.
[2:19:24] Kisswani: like getting your ball from a neighbours yard KEKW
[2:19:27] Jessethoth: @Towelliee Maybe has a puff puff
[2:19:29] Dagomarus: Oh yeah, Ive been looking for this sword everywhere!
[2:19:42] Kaype92: What sword? What are you talking about? There’s no sword no way
[2:19:46] xendros78: azeroth wakes up, pulls the sword out and uses it as a weapon on a void lord
[2:19:54] Jarlan23: they probably will
[2:19:55] Argentwingss: "Sorry guys, imma... imma just pick this up. Had a rough night last night" @Towelliee
[2:19:57] Jessethoth: @Towelliee I wouldn't mind them leaving it, and it becomes relevant like WAY DOWN the line or something
[2:19:57] NEMERL: I think every major xpac patch will help other aspect to regain thier powers
[2:20:06] Jarlan23: a reminder of blizzards attention to detail
[2:20:08] Dagomarus: Who just flies through silithis lol
[2:20:14] mmrghost7: what sword
[2:20:14] simonbgg: Next time I get stabbed I'll just leave the knife in there and tell them to disinfect the wound, let my body EMBRACE the knife!
[2:20:15] Jessethoth: @Towelliee Or Twilight's Hammer build a crazy ass city all around it...pretty good foundation...
[2:20:16] swervo61: how long did it take to fix the shit that happened to stormwind in cata?
[2:20:47] Kisswani: Dont we have a sword already in Darkshore where the pantheon fucked some old god up ?
[2:20:48] Wadjaah: Remove it and explain why it's gone in a book WeSmart
[2:20:50] Panchee_: chupapi

[2:21:24] digitoxity: he pulls the sword out and it accidently blows up azeroth
[2:21:39] xendros78: does sargeras wallace look like a bitch
[2:21:43] Kisswani: yeah Azeroth starts defalting Kappa
[2:21:49] simonbgg: @zerotize And wow ends, forever!
[2:21:51] Dagomarus: He turns into ross from friends “you threw my sword away, my sword!? MYY SWORD!?”
[2:21:53] DoubleNova: it was just a joke
[2:21:59] Jimstur: twinkets!!!!
[2:22:05] Jessethoth: @Towelliee My buddy was saying the eye of the hilt should be a raid instance portal...somehow the shit transports us into a Titan chamber.
[2:22:15] minael1: i still think that sword keep c'thun dead
[2:22:16] Im_a_sad_man: So are we getting rewamped uldaman next patch does it have remastered visuals or just to fit the whole mythic+ deal.
[2:22:19] Jessethoth: Either way is fine
[2:22:25] Akoudadis: Strap some rockets on top and cut it off! Send it back where it came from
[2:22:26] jaysteea: take the sword out and even more azerite out... BFA 2
[2:22:30] Jessethoth: Leave it or do something with it.
[2:22:30] roronoa929: Magnie  : " CHAMPION! The goblins need your help to extract the Sword to HEAL AZEROTH"   Noooooooooooooo

[2:24:16] lornthok: ask a titan

[2:24:20] lornthok: idk
[2:24:25] Akoudadis: Call antman to pull it off
[2:24:28] JustPureLucky: dw im a tauren ill move it
[2:24:29] Jessethoth: @Towelliee Well, Ahn'qiraj links up to Azjol-Nerub miles under Kalimdor and Northrend, not sure if that's RPG books or not, but I remember shit about that a long time ago.
[2:24:43] ILikeKillTheZombies: i mean we went to land the dead and sky opened
[2:24:47] szble: if and when azeroth wakes up it'll be her sword
[2:24:53] JustPureLucky: we can drop it into the center of ironforge ment it and build a new city
[2:24:59] JustPureLucky: melt*
[2:24:59] Jessethoth: @Towelliee Almost 100% sure you'd need a titan.
[2:25:01] Daveybutter: its only an illusion
[2:25:11] fondufilms: Why get rid
[2:25:17] astreinoid: transmog the sword
[2:25:29] simonbgg: Let Azeroth embrace it into here!
[2:25:31] Jessethoth: @Towelliee Would just be an interesting spin if Azeroth herself takes it when she wakes up.
[2:25:33] Kickack: an illusion? what are you hiding
[2:25:37] zanches98: the damn dragons are gonna use the magic they have to pull the thing out man

[2:25:55] hnti86: Cataclism 2 Kappa
[2:26:23] BoezIRL: it's all part of the jailers plan
[2:26:28] fondufilms: Azeroth crumbles if the sword is removed
[2:26:31] Dagomarus: You can speak to bronze dragonflight guy in silithis to revert it back to before the sword came… but silithis looked like shit before too so didnt make much difference
[2:26:32] Im_a_sad_man: Isnt the old god dying threat retconned now we can kill them safely LUL
[2:26:36] lukeymoo: you bleed out slower if u leave the sword in
[2:26:37] nvnto: You just use magic and remove it 4Head
[2:26:49] Jarlan23: you could take the chains from the maw and pull out the sword with the lightforged spaceship
[2:26:51] ZakuzaGB: we need king Arthur of the warcraft universe
[2:26:52] Jessethoth: @Towelliee Yeah, the Taschalaac that we get from Antorus is like a "dimmed down" version compared to Aggramar's.

[2:27:07] Jessethoth: @Towelliee Kind of like what we did with Sulfurass
[2:27:14] JustPureLucky: pull it out like a little toothpick and we are saved
[2:27:25] dankmeliodas: Azeroth is gonna pull the sword from the planet when she hatches

[2:27:37] Jessethoth: @Danklobos That's what I was saying.
[2:28:01] Jessethoth: @Danklobos Makes the most sense, she wakes up and is pissed all like "I'm gonna find the MF'er that put this here and shove it up his ass!"

[2:28:56] TheAbraxas94: and then? where do we put the sword?
[2:29:07] kimmo_gaming: @Towelliee Always thought that the Jailer would pull out a sword and that was the plan all along
[2:29:11] Jessethoth: @Towelliee The Vindicaar should just be BOMBARDING shit in some major battle down the line.
[2:29:19] Jimstur: @TheAbraxas94 just throw it in space
[2:29:21] Jessethoth: @Towelliee Have it like a backdrop during a massive raid.
[2:29:28] lornthok: oh yeah and we pull it out throw it into space and it will hit the titan pantheon and they will c9me back and they will be mad
[2:29:31] BoezIRL: I don't think it's easy to port it to the shadowlands
[2:29:44] digitoxity: yes
[2:29:44] ydotcalm: @Towelliee wassup dude!! your vesper bartender here!!
[2:29:46] Jessethoth: @Towelliee I thought the way that the Artifacts would return is with the Heart empowering them.
[2:29:54] Jessethoth: @Towelliee That could be cool too.
[2:29:57] kimmo_gaming: We can get the power crystals and make Lightsabers LOL
[2:30:02] Daikanatv: only if we can empower it with azerite LUL
[2:30:25] niebvelungen: what sword?

[2:30:35] Kisswani: " shut up Jeff , not now "
[2:30:36] Jessethoth: @Towelliee They probably have a few cool ideas, and the hell of it is they can't figure out which one is the best.
[2:30:38] DannyBoyWho: 20 bux it just "disappears"
[2:30:42] Akermay: The sword that shall not be named
[2:30:47] xendros78: he's the guy that gets thrown out of the window

[2:31:34] Jessethoth: @Towelliee Not to mention, this community will shit on them no matter how awesome it is.
[2:31:39] Jimstur: I loved the simplistic mini story lines in classic.
[2:31:53] Jessethoth: @Towelliee True
[2:32:02] Jessethoth: @Towelliee I like your idea of it just suddenly being dealt with.
[2:32:04] xendros78: maybe the sword is like the lich king, there must always be one
[2:32:30] Jessethoth: @Towelliee Like Azeroth just rips it out of her side when she awakens and its the first 20 seconds of a cinematic and it's just NEVER mentioned after that, she just has it and no one mentions it.

[3:01:36] Sadisticmedic: Blizzard should check out 2k also with the WWE and NBA mobile games
[3:01:36] ILikeKillTheZombies: blizzard is often one step behind other companies when it comes to stuff like that
[3:01:38] manerz32: you will probably be able to throw it onto something like Bluestacks without blizzard even having to do anything on their end
[3:01:59] HijarL: my guess is that shortly after release some nerds will make it available on pc
[3:02:06] MetalManGG: the thing with mobile games is that I would only play them when I'm outside, but when I'm outside I don't want my battery to get rekt, I would rather just listen to music

[3:03:19] Metallical: So, I have a convoluted theory. In the announcement of WotLK Classic, they mentioned no Dungeon Finder, stating the social reasons that people have complained about. I wonder what other changes they will make in the Classic expansions? Like will they change the linear questing of Cata, etc? Then, since classic expansions will come out faster than the originals did, will they have made changes to retail in conjunction, having them both result in the same new expansion at that point?
[3:03:32] ILikeKillTheZombies: i had to go back to 10, because i had some optimization issues with 11 in games

[3:04:55] Sphinx2k: a lot of new computers only come with 11 now
[3:04:57] manerz32: @Metallical if the wow classic model is anything like the EQ TLPs, once it gets to where retail is, it will just merge and then they will start a fresh server at classic again
[3:04:57] lazzlow__: LUL
[3:05:09] Alexkat20: tbf she is a dragon :)
[3:05:11] sLogOG: hey dragon is dragon, we have ysera here LUL

[3:06:06] Kisswani: They wont

[3:06:07] luckfore: theres plenty of dragon riding on Rule34 Kappa
[3:06:10] Kisswani: it's her daughter
[3:06:11] Praetour: @Towelliee they said its her daughter not Ysera
[3:06:12] zanches98: she isen't going
[3:06:16] MerffTV: I don't think they are, as her daughter is there
[3:06:18] shanks_blank: @Towelliee who is replacing ysera as a dragon aspect ?
[3:06:21] ILikeKillTheZombies: ysera mount in pre order
[3:06:23] HijarL: ysera was a green dragon, right?
[3:06:23] RPClipsGTA: dragon riding is just falling with style hence why ion said flying "in a sense"
[3:06:29] Kisswani: D:
[3:06:35] Sphinx2k: D:
[3:06:38] Neowanderer: but she is saving her sisters pet lol
[3:06:40] Norbi33: Do we know the main enemy of the new expasion? @Towelliee
[3:06:42] fistofnature: my boi ursoc PepeHands
[3:06:43] Scoodles91: they said its yesera's daughter
[3:06:58] manerz32: @RPClipsGTA that is in regards to the racial ability i think not actual dragon flying
[3:07:09] sephronz: I'd say ardenweald will have some sort of connection to the groves in the Dragon Isles
[3:07:12] kimmo_gaming: They will find a way of putting Ysera there
[3:07:16] KaisenSiru: I wonder who her consort was
[3:07:23] shanks_blank: anybody knows who is replacing ysera as a dragon aspect ?
[3:07:27] Praetour: Ysera's dead bro
[3:07:34] sLogOG: who will be the leader of green aspect?
[3:07:37] Jessethoth: Of course it would
[3:07:37] Qargory: shes dead, how she going to be there lmao
[3:07:39] HijarL: @norbi33 it is the father of the dragons iirc
[3:07:40] Jessethoth: They're linked
[3:07:42] sLogOG: didn't we ressurected Ysera?
[3:07:54] Praetour: We saved her soul not resurrected @sLogOG
[3:07:56] Qargory: no, just saved her from a nightmare
[3:07:58] Qargory: shes still dead
[3:08:00] Jessethoth: @sLogOG Nope, she awoke in the Shadowlands.
[3:08:04] shanks_blank: @Towelliee who is the leader of green aspect now ?
[3:08:16] Im_a_sad_man: I bet ysera will be back in the tyrande questline in dragonflight.
[3:08:17] Qargory: her daughter
[3:08:18] Jessethoth: @sLogOG In the mortal world she's history. Merithra is the intended successor.
[3:08:18] sLogOG: aah okay, so she is connected to shadowlands oaky
[3:08:23] sunmx: wheres denathrias?
[3:08:29] HijarL: I guess she can still be around in the emerald dream or something
[3:08:31] shanks_blank: @Qargory whats here name ?
[3:08:40] Jessethoth: @Im_a_sad_man They've been setting Merithra up as her successor for a while now.
[3:08:40] dankmeliodas: The winter queen gives tyrandae a seed to plant in our world in 9.2.5
[3:08:42] Praetour: True where is denathrius didn't he go mia in 9.1?
[3:08:43] CrusaderNero: @sunmx inside a sword
[3:08:44] smiley7878: i bet pre patch starts up questlines to res all the major dragons names
[3:08:50] minael1: the dreadlords are technically dead, yet they walked around the living. so Ysera coming bad, ain't such an impossibility
[3:08:57] Aidler: Ysera is gone gone like Black Widow in the MCU
[3:09:01] smiley7878: alll the lore
[3:09:03] sLogOG: hmm just checked, she is ysera's daughter it seems. cool! @Jessethoth
[3:09:08] Jessethoth: @Praetour Denathrius is a loose thread, which is a good thing, they went a little too hard in tying off loose ends.
[3:09:12] JackHealMe: She's dead lol Let the dead be dead
[3:09:18] Jimstur: Friend of mine was able to register Charizard as the name for his future evoker. I am jelly
[3:09:23] manerz32: has the black flight even been involved really since nef?
[3:09:24] ArcaneSyntax: huh I'd didn't realize mirithra was in vanilla.
[3:09:25] Norbi33: Kalacegos ?
[3:09:27] smiley7878: dead like arthas dead
[3:09:30] Jessethoth: @Praetour Gotta have loose ends to create more stories. :D
[3:09:30] Praetour: @Jessethoth sick, will be good having him back at some point, I liked him
[3:09:31] Xanigh: The winter queen said that ysera is now bound to the ardenweald, so doubt we see her in dragon isle
[3:09:32] Im_a_sad_man: Nothing stays dead in wow LUL
[3:09:36] Blackminuz: almost 60 nice :D
[3:09:41] smiley7878: a puff of blue smoke
[3:09:41] mrlunaplay: i think she will be resurrected since ardenweald is more about preservation and bring back the creature who died
[3:09:43] The_Tacozilla: probably will have a quest to re-empower the aspects including the new leaders for some dragonflights
[3:09:45] newkingcody: give wrathion horns
[3:09:48] Jessethoth: @Praetour Agreed, he was one of those "likeable" villains.
[3:09:53] dankmeliodas: Alexstraza and Nozdormu are the only two original aspects left
[3:10:13] Metallical: Is Azuregos still fawning over the spirit healer in Azshara?
[3:10:15] Jessethoth: @The_Tacozilla I think the entire expansion's questing is to do with that, it's like the entire expansion theme.
[3:10:39] Tawiscara: @Towelliee are you done with lost ark friend?

[3:19:03] TheCliffyShow: Dracthyr named Smaug is going to be like Elves named Legolas.
[3:19:08] Zettabyte: How many Smaug variations will we have? xSmaug, SmaugX, xSmaugX xXSmaugXx etc lol
[3:19:12] Todmeister9000: I'm gonna name my dragon Towelliee
[3:19:23] Jessethoth: Charizard, Parthinox and Skyrim dragon names, Warcraft dragon names, like 500 variants of Deaathwingg and Dethwiinng and Nelltharionn.

[3:19:38] Scoodles91: it does
[3:19:45] Zettabyte: My wolf pet on my hunter is called Howelliee KEKW
[3:19:54] Jessethoth: @Towelliee Did you know that Deathwing was originally puffing on a bong or hookah in Warcraft Adventures: Lord of the Clans before it was cancelled?
[3:19:55] spicykekw: !Alpha Sniffies

[3:20:07] Qargory: gotta be charizard
[3:20:09] Scoodles91: no drugs and driving pls :D
[3:20:12] ArcaneSyntax: Snorlax isn't a bad name for a dragon tbh
[3:20:14] Jessethoth: @Towelliee The game
[3:20:17] ArcaneSyntax: it was a game
[3:20:21] Jessethoth: @Towelliee It was one of those point and click games.
[3:20:23] jamarky23: It was crack
[3:20:26] The_Tacozilla: point and click warcraft game
[3:20:28] Jessethoth: @Towelliee They rewrote it into a book
[3:20:28] JudahDeLeon: Sindragosa
[3:20:29] unholyorc: catJAM
[3:20:34] Ezekyler: adventure game like monkey island
[3:20:45] Jessethoth: The shame about that game is it was mostly done, might as well have just finished it.
[3:20:51] Jessethoth: There were some funny puzzles in that shit.
[3:20:54] kimmo_gaming: @Towelliee I am going to name mine Dannaerys so i can ride that drragon LOL
[3:21:05] Jessethoth: @Towelliee Yeah like Monkey Island, point and click.
[3:21:06] klindatu: point&click adv
[3:21:07] Praetour: point and click game I think
[3:21:27] Jessethoth: @Towelliee Funny thing, Clancy Brown voiced Thrall, YEARS later and they get him as Blackhand in the movie.
[3:21:28] TheCliffyShow: Didn't the story of that game get turned into Lord of the Clans.
[3:21:36] Jessethoth: @Towelliee There's a full Let's Play of it on Youtube.
[3:21:40] 91Daniel91: !alpha

[3:21:44] Im_a_sad_man: It was a point click game like the hugo series LUL
[3:21:44] Ezekyler: in Chris Metzen basement
[3:21:55] klindatu: you watch a playthrough on youtube
[3:21:59] Jessethoth: @Ezekyler Not even, full playthrough on Youtube. lol
[3:22:24] Jessethoth: I feel like if you fuze Overwatch and Destiny you're close to what Titan MIGHT have been.
[3:22:41] TheCliffyShow: Didn't the story of that game get turned into Lord of the Clans or something?
[3:22:46] Jessethoth: Almost like Wildstar fucked Destiny is what I magine.
[3:22:53] The_Tacozilla: good ol' escort quests
[3:22:57] Jessethoth: @TheCliffyShow Yeah, the novel by Christie Golden.
[3:23:18] Jessethoth: @TheCliffyShow The entire thing was to set up Thrall before WC3 and to show the "redeemable" side of the orcs, that they were "corrupted".
[3:23:46] Jessethoth: @TheCliffyShow Before Warcraft 3 in WC1 and 2 they were just almost carbon copies of Warhammer orcs, just evil, green and red eyed for the sake of being evil.
[3:24:04] luckfore: he knows POGGERS
[3:24:07] Jessethoth: @Towelliee I honestly hope it's good, I don't want it to fail even though I'm not the biggest Overwatch fan.
[3:24:24] ArcaneSyntax: well never know because the pve mode in OW2 will never be released lmao
[3:24:33] vyranoth: Alpha Sniffies ?
[3:24:51] shanks_blank: @Towelliee do you think there will be a blademaster class in wow one day ?
[3:24:57] Metallical: My curiosity is piqued at their survival game announcement.
[3:24:57] Alexkat20: NDAs are harsh
[3:25:03] Jessethoth: It's just like the more Dark Souls style version of D4...I don't want that to be a main Diablo game, but I'd LOVE a Souls type spinoff Diablo.
[3:25:08] vyranoth: what does that even mean ahhahha
[3:25:25] ArcaneSyntax: is blademaster just arms?
[3:25:32] Jessethoth: @Towelliee I could see them doing "archtypes" like Archmage, Archdruid, that's the only way I'd see Blademaster in there, it'd be like an Arms "uber form".
[3:25:37] simonbgg: Wasnt ingame shots of the Starcraft FPS game leaked somewhere? Or have I've dreamt about that shit haha
[3:25:45] Jessethoth: Then you'd get Far Seer for shamans.
[3:25:57] tragicjm: they did its called warrior just pretend you are the best in the land
[3:26:06] Jessethoth: I guess the one for death knight would be deathbringer
[3:26:11] ArcaneSyntax: my shaman's already a far seer.
[3:26:25] Jessethoth: @Towelliee @simonbgg Gamecube, it was cancelled.
[3:26:40] ricoNajt: There was gonna be a FPS-adventure Starcraft game called Starcraft Ghost
[3:26:43] DoubleNova: it was april fools right?
[3:26:44] Jessethoth: @Towelliee @simonbgg No it was a 3rd person game, they had footage and screenshots of it, this was back in like 2003 or so.
[3:27:00] Jessethoth: Starcraft: Ghost was on GameCube it was real it was a 3rd person shooter.
[3:27:01] simonbgg: Aaahh, got that stuff mixed up then! :D
[3:27:02] Jessethoth: Not 1st.
[3:27:04] KaisenSiru: Yep. Only when it makes sense. Which makes sense.
[3:27:06] luckfore: expansions that have a new race/class are usually good ones
[3:27:10] Jessethoth: Again, a game that was remade into a novel.
[3:27:14] DuskDragone: I'ce noticed that each expansion is just like a offset/more story version of a previous expansion. Legion - Burning Crusades, Shadowlands - WoTLK, Dragonflight - Cataclysm
[3:27:16] Jessethoth: Just like Warcraft Lord of the Clans.
[3:27:17] Praetour: Catgirl expansion will be huge
[3:27:25] JudahDeLeon: I have always wanted to play Dryads and Centaurs in WoW
[3:27:33] cerealkillas22: I just want a hoplite class that uses a spear and shield
[3:27:39] Qargory: isnt that final fantasy? lol
[3:27:42] shanks_blank: I want gnolls as a playable race
[3:27:45] Negative_Ion: @Praetour ffxiv type beat
[3:27:49] ricoNajt: yeah, sorry 3rd person, so long ago I saw something about it ;D
[3:27:53] ArcaneSyntax: daddynathrius
[3:27:55] mmrghost7: he is still alive
[3:27:58] mmrghost7: fking around
[3:28:05] tragicjm: theres kratos
[3:28:10] Jessethoth: @cerealkillas22 Gladiator Stance for warrior in Warlords of Draenor was the closest thing to that and it was fucking glorious and they fucking took it away. :( *rage*
[3:28:14] littleofc1: gigachad
[3:28:15] JackHealMe: his soul is in a sword
[3:28:16] Jarlan23: hes in the sword
[3:28:17] smiley7878: kinda looks like demon verison of legolas
[3:28:18] Qargory: yeah hes somewhere
[3:28:20] niebvelungen: he is
[3:28:20] simonbgg: I hope to god that we get more of Denathrius in a future expac/patch!
[3:28:22] Jessethoth: @Towelliee He's in the sword Remornia, the dreadlords got it and escaped.
[3:28:24] vyranoth: yeah he's alive but on the back burner for now haaha
[3:28:24] sunmx: dread lords steal the sword
[3:28:25] ventu105: Yes he is alive
[3:28:25] Metallical: There is a Starcraft Ghost game trailer, narrated by Optimus Prime out there.
[3:28:28] cerealkillas22: yea i loved glad stance when it was a thing @Jessethoth
[3:28:31] ricoNajt: yo @Towelliee your hero is blinded by the hood
[3:28:36] mmrghost7: malganis stole it
[3:28:36] KaisenSiru: The Soul in the Sword
[3:28:39] The_Tacozilla: he has become the next artifact weapon
[3:28:40] TheCliffyShow: I would imagine the dreadlords got him out.
[3:28:45] mmrghost7: they probalby got him out
[3:28:46] Svergson: Whats the best way to get/handle addons nowadays?
[3:28:55] aminus: ready for 11.0 denathrius returns
[3:29:04] mmrghost7: i want him to fight illidan
[3:29:06] Jessethoth: @Towelliee Exactly, that's like their thing.
[3:29:09] simonbgg: Legit the best villian in a while! Feels like a true comic book villain
[3:29:10] griffdog125: Did you see that funny darkest secret in wow video
[3:29:23] simonbgg: +1 haha
[3:29:29] Jessethoth: @Towelliee It's just like the Legion, we killed their fast respawn, but those fuckers were respawning even when Sargeras was still fighting them.
[3:29:30] shanks_blank: +1
[3:29:37] Jessethoth: It was just slower.
[3:29:39] Im_a_sad_man: Almost all of them died in legion by illidan when their homeplanet was destroyed.
[3:29:43] vyranoth: And apparently there is one among us ;)
[3:29:43] Praetour: Wait so Lothraxxion was evil after all huh
[3:29:51] Frostfury: Daddy Denathrius Pog
[3:29:53] Jessethoth: @Towelliee I'd say the demons are even MORE chaotic without a single leader.
[3:30:06] FallenxGabe: Void expansion maybe
[3:30:20] Jessethoth: @Towelliee Also with the Zereth installations, we got hints of one for each force, so Zereth Tumult would be Chaos/Twisting Nether.
[3:30:32] Neowanderer: sir denathrios comes back when we find out jana is a dreadlord too lol
[3:30:33] simonbgg: @nilone4 I would fuck with that hahaha
[3:30:50] vyranoth: wait the Lothraxxion stuff, that was confirmed? I didn't see anything about that!
[3:30:54] Jessethoth: I swear, at this point, the Jaina dreadlord meme that Jesse Cox started has to just happen.
[3:31:12] Jessethoth: Dude, he'd be like "I FUCKING TOLD YOU ALL!"
[3:31:20] Fubarlogixx: whos mitchjones
[3:31:22] shanks_blank: @Towelliee who is warchief of the horde now ?
[3:31:28] cerealkillas22: the infiltration book
[3:31:33] Jessethoth: Grimoire of the Shadowlands & Beyond?
[3:31:39] Jessethoth: Oh
[3:31:39] vyranoth: Yeah the journels but that could of been another subplot xD
[3:31:40] DuskDragone: Thrall?
[3:31:40] Praetour: True forgot about htat one
[3:32:04] Jessethoth: So when the Light found Lothraxxion out they sent the invasion into Revendreth.
[3:32:08] cerealkillas22: they created the realm of death KGB
[3:32:24] Wadjaah: I am a dreadlord :)
[3:32:32] vyranoth: Beware the eyes of green >.>
[3:32:46] Frostfury: The Devs did mentioned about Denathrius may return
[3:32:50] shanks_blank: @Towelliee do you think blizzard is really done with Arthas ?
[3:32:59] cerealkillas22: they have all the statuettes and the dark portal statues they can spy through too
[3:32:59] Moobot: Check out Towelliee's YouTube channel! You can view the most recent uploaded video HERE || THE BIRTH OF CHADBOMB!! - WoW 9 to 5 Episode 1 youtu.be/8qc5QklRzIo
[3:33:01] mmrghost7: mabe they got him out
[3:33:02] vyranoth: @shanks_blank 100000% done
[3:33:08] Jarlan23: watch pelegos be a dreadlord
[3:33:23] smiley7878: box em up
[3:33:29] TheCliffyShow: Like Bwonsamdi
[3:33:29] Nelyu: So well, when the Dreadlords going to the Nether when they die, who's gonna to ress them up without Argus?
[3:33:33] ILikeKillTheZombies: one of really few interresting characters. Bastion NPC's are the most boring
[3:33:33] EpicJune: he felt more fleshed out than most imho
[3:33:36] Praetour: His soul disappeared he's done
[3:33:40] JudahDeLeon: Uldaman will be filled with the Scarlet Crusade fighting Troggs and Denathrios will be their leader and the final boss
[3:33:43] soundofmuzak3: "in case of falling subs, please open sword"
[3:33:45] mmrghost7: they wasted arthas
[3:33:52] dankmeliodas: That was them shitting on his grave
[3:33:53] Jessethoth: "Five keys to open our way. Five torches to light our path."
[3:33:55] Jessethoth: "Five lanterns now darkened. The flames they seek will light the Masters' way."

[3:33:57] Gingerprimer: Was a very nice cutscnes
[3:33:58] michaelkn: Man that was really suck a letdown for Arthas imo :( I really wanted a more emotional scene with Jaina and stuff
[3:34:01] mmrghost7: absolutly wasted him away
[3:34:03] Raiko_Sins: I don't understand doing a cutscene like that just before WOTLK classic which will make 1000s of people want him back again
[3:34:04] Neowanderer: look at kael'thas how many times has he dided and we have seen him again
[3:34:12] dankmeliodas: That cutscene sucked
[3:34:16] Jessethoth: @Towelliee See I think that's bullshit for several reasons, but also, it'd be interesting if that was his spirit showing up at the end of the book behind Sylvanas.
[3:34:22] Praetour: Jaina should have been the one to say goodbye not sylvanas being all moody
[3:34:28] matt2d2007: bwonsamdi denathrius team up when? lol
[3:34:48] vyranoth: @Danklobos it gave a lot of closeur and was a nice end to his story....
[3:34:50] Jessethoth: The better writing would have been to have his soul freed, to suddenly warn Sylvanas about shit.
[3:35:07] Neowanderer: yeah they show have done more with broswamdi only saw him in the night fae campaign
[3:35:08] Jessethoth: @Towelliee He could have been the Jailer
[3:35:09] KingSlayerYotam: Yea blizz really wanted to get rid of him, i blame denosour
[3:35:12] vyranoth: @Jessethoth why free him? He's actions were his own!
[3:35:14] dankmeliodas: @darkrangersis no it did not he deserved better
[3:35:16] Jessethoth: @Towelliee Maybe give us a warning about the Primus or some shit.
[3:35:20] ILikeKillTheZombies: i think it would be nice if they did to arthas what they did to illidan, leaving some "memories" scatteredd around
[3:35:22] Jessethoth: @Towelliee How is it terrible?
[3:35:24] ZakuzaGB: sometimes its good to just let stuff be so we remember how it was
[3:35:26] Ondrys8: !ui

[3:35:27] mmrghost7: u might be glad but so many ppl felt sad
[3:35:28] Wadjaah: leave the man rest in peace haha
[3:35:30] Neowanderer: nah the primus was the orignal jailer
[3:35:37] Fiivee_: @Jessethoth thats so stupid LULW
[3:35:38] WoW_StandalonE: nothing is dead dead in wow Kappa
[3:35:40] TheCliffyShow: Bellular had a similar opinion. He was relieved they didn't do something lame and ruin him.
[3:35:41] Im_a_sad_man: Arthas was just a dread lord the real one is waiting LUL
[3:35:46] tragicjm: how upsetting is it going to be when the best version of wow imo wotlk gets boring
[3:35:47] JudahDeLeon: I've ttalked to several ghosts in Azeroth every single day I've played wow
[3:35:51] Jessethoth: @Fiivee_ I get it dude, you're a fan. Relax.
[3:35:56] Raiko_Sins: Copium of me wanting to see him casually riding Sindragosa through Dragonflight zones xD
[3:35:57] JudahDeLeon: no one ever really dies in this game
[3:36:03] Fiivee_: @Jessethoth HUH
[3:36:10] Jessethoth: I think the Primus being a traitor makes more sense.
[3:36:21] Jessethoth: ICC was mid
[3:36:24] KaisenSiru: Classic PepeLaugh
[3:36:26] Jessethoth: Ulduar GOAT
[3:36:33] Armdel: Its the lich king BatChest
[3:36:33] michaelkn: Ulduar is gonna be so much fun!
[3:36:36] dankmeliodas: @darkrangersis the character did yes. Without the Arthas story Warcraft wouldn’t have got as big as it did
[3:36:43] luckfore: i think blizz should focus on creating cool new characters like Denathrius rather than bringing back old characters for nostalgia reasons
[3:36:50] Jessethoth: @Towelliee I think they got that from the leaked Zovaal concept.
[3:36:50] smiley7878: lot of ppl not going to play cause of the lfg  rants
[3:37:00] vyranoth: @Danklobos I agree ya, the best wow villian ever!
[3:37:03] Jessethoth: @Towelliee His armor melting away the same way Anduin's did was their basis for that shit I guess.
[3:37:09] michaelkn: @smiley7878 ofc they are gonna play. They are just whining a bit
[3:37:23] Jessethoth: @Towelliee I'm happy with Dragonflight I know that, people being negative about it is kind of a bummer.
[3:37:30] minael1: just like wod. forget all about it, huh?
[3:37:33] schneid4: its canned, moving on
[3:37:39] Jessethoth: Kind of yeah
[3:37:41] Korupcija_: we'll see after 9.2.5, apparently lots of encrypted story stuff
[3:37:44] vyranoth: idk I feel like shadowlands was made just to save two major characters story arc aka, sylvanas and tyrande
[3:37:45] Jessethoth: It's the best thing to do is let it rest.
[3:37:51] HijarL: if they really dont implement LfG...some modders will
[3:37:53] ILikeKillTheZombies: well they kinda went back to WoD with maghar storyline
[3:38:01] ILikeKillTheZombies: opening a possible scenario
[3:38:07] Jessethoth: @Towelliee Well people DEMAND it to be salvaged.
[3:38:10] assman_ny: Hold on we are done?
[3:38:12] KaisenSiru: YEP
[3:38:16] MaleFrom73: 2 expansions later "shadowlands was very good"
[3:38:18] Jessethoth: @Towelliee They get invested in the potential even when they think it's bad true.
[3:38:19] Mcsuiy: what would you think of the stone watchers being an allied race btw?!?! :o
[3:38:21] Praetour: I think most of the hate is pacing and gameplay rather than story
[3:38:25] JackHealMe: We'll get throw backs
[3:38:31] Im_a_sad_man: Jailer was such a good villain we need more of him LUL
[3:38:31] The_Tacozilla: I feel like the shadowlands was a nice thing to learn about in lore from books etc, but actually going there maybe wasnt the best idea
[3:38:33] vyranoth: dont they say ever xpac suck?
[3:38:37] Jessethoth: @Towelliee I don't even think it's that fucking bad, I'd definitely take my pick of what I like.
[3:38:41] Korupcija_: 9.2 is uninroncally so good to me
[3:38:44] dankmeliodas: Shadowlands lore could have been great
[3:38:45] nvnto: In my opinion, they have been doing a rather poor job of telling their story in the game recently.
[3:38:45] Neowanderer: just like wod everyone hated it back then but now like it
[3:38:48] Truthseeker96: also true
[3:38:51] KingSlayerYotam: I mean, blizz introduced a half written story and people want closer
[3:38:53] Panasonic82: It has become more popular to hate on it. It shows how "dedicated" they are...
[3:38:55] Reasso: is this xpac bad or good?
[3:38:57] Jessethoth: @Towelliee Like now people say BFA wasn't that bad, I was saying it then, I only hated 8.0.
[3:39:01] JudahDeLeon: everyones secretly waiting for Shadowlands Classic in 8 years?
[3:39:06] Rayzorhail: Was Legion considered "good" when it was current? Because now people say its one of the good ones
[3:39:15] Heyhowsitgoingtonight: W OMEGALUL D
[3:39:23] Gargantix: 9.0 through until 9.2 was doodoo, but 9.2 has been a SL redemption arc
[3:39:29] UnholyLP: both bad, legion was good tho :)
[3:39:33] Jessethoth: @Towelliee I like 9.2 > 9.0 > 9.1 in that order, I still say WoD was trash can.
[3:39:33] vyranoth: WOD SUCKED
[3:39:36] reformedalex12345: @Rayzorhail it was very mixed
[3:39:43] aumixp: Shadowlands is a good xpac.. For my mount collection ☺️ The amount mounts we gotten this xpac is insane

[3:39:47] dankmeliodas: @gargantix in terms of game play yeah
[3:39:51] vyranoth: I'll take SL anyday over WOD
[3:39:57] Varodox: I've always said that the content that WoD had was good, just not enough of it.
[3:40:03] Jessethoth: YEP
[3:40:05] Jessethoth: Bigtime
[3:40:12] Heyhowsitgoingtonight: HDC is one of my favorite raids of all time
[3:40:19] Rayzorhail: Nah BFA was never good in my opinion. Way too many failed mechanics. Azerite was shit, islands was shit. Story started fine but turned shit pretty quickly
[3:40:19] Heyhowsitgoingtonight: HFC

[4:17:44] Nokterian: 12 min is just insane
[4:17:56] Triist0ne: i mean i mean naowh has a point but how he put out his opinion was a bit much
[4:18:02] Cryttan: Roasted
[4:18:05] lith1995: He's kinda right tho
[4:18:09] raye_gaming22: i mean hes not wrong especaly nagura

[4:18:15] raye_gaming22: dont knwo waht shes talking about
[4:18:22] Havoc_S1: I think he needs to get over himself
[4:18:29] Panasonic82: The caster were kinda fooling around, but that's actually how I prefer it. Doesnt have to be stiff and boring
[4:18:52] Demanisraar: exactly that
[4:18:54] fillefaren: how did you get that background @Towelliee ?
[4:18:56] SirMouSe: Easy or not - still their job
[4:18:57] Demanisraar: It's the whole thing
[4:19:00] manmower: need to talk fast and talk about interrupt to stir up excitement
[4:19:21] flebbooo: We will never be slaves SMOrc
[4:19:28] Arthur_eld: yeah. that's rude as fuck
[4:19:36] lith1995: but often they say obvious bs info, that shouldn't happen
[4:19:40] Aidler: what caster in any sports ever knew anything that is going on atm? they know way more then the normal general viewer but come on…
[4:19:45] Digidan2005: Digidan2005 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 123 months! 123 Kappa
[4:19:47] Cryttan: PogChamp
[4:19:48] Korupcija_: nut
[4:19:54] SirMouSe: right but if they are missing big plays because they dont know whats going on its not unfair to call them unprepared
[4:19:56] Aidler: anything = everything
[4:20:15] Mistery836: ye. normally the teams just keep everything secret. so how are the casters supposed to know what the hell is going on too LUL MDI is full of small things you sometimes don't even notice being done
[4:20:18] Clicklesly: Except the teams didn't even want to talk about specific stuff after the matches apparently ^^
[4:20:19] Moobot: We got Discord servers! Featuring giveaways, live twitter feeds, live news from Wowhead, memes, pets and more! Subs even get their own private lounge! Join HERE | discord.gg/towelliee |
[4:20:32] reformedalex12345: and why tf are they not streaming it on twitch? LUL
[4:20:36] Stixxerz: to be honest didnt even know the mdi was going
[4:20:40] SirMouSe: thats true - you want WoW viewership you gotta go with twitch
[4:20:42] Boccu2009: I feel its a bit unfair to expect casters to instantly realise this new incredibly high skill strat is happening and how it works when they might not play at that level currently
[4:20:46] danimoto10: any thought about asmon going to interview ion?
[4:20:46] Havoc_S1: All that WoW fame is getting to his head.
[4:20:46] Demanisraar: Would love to see it on twitch again
[4:20:49] GrimMSickles: yep
[4:20:55] Crowzcut: twitch so pay more then
[4:20:59] lith1995: @12345Alex12345 blizz has a contact with youtube
[4:21:02] flebbooo: yep yep, only reason i don’t keep up with MDI anymore is cause its not on twitch
[4:21:08] Crowzcut: should*
[4:21:15] reformedalex12345: @lith1995 oh didnt know that
[4:21:17] Alepouditsa: i will just do fire balls Kappa
[4:21:25] fillefaren: No matter how harsh it was, he was certainly right i would say
[4:21:49] Demanisraar: It's part of the fun though
[4:21:52] Arthur_eld: I think Dratnos and Tettles are fun to watch
[4:22:06] Rottencoarse: @Towelliee  yesd
[4:22:09] Rottencoarse: *yes
[4:22:19] TeflonDon94: Youtube chat is just not as entry-friendly as twitch'.
[4:22:21] fillefaren: No matter how harsh it was, he was certainly right i would say
[4:22:22] Fortvila: the casters there mainly to make it more fun. WHo the fuck cares  about all the nerdy stuff
[4:22:27] santamex: its hard to cast from a single perspective, for MDI casting to be better they would need a freecam overbiew
[4:22:41] AssassinKhal: echo and their fans just seem to have an issue with anyone having fun during comp shit
[4:22:50] raye_gaming22: dratnos is good cuz he knows hes shit hes prob about nagura as shes a weak point
[4:22:50] kiruz__: They are entertaining and that's why I watch. Not for reading combat log...
[4:23:04] Piebringer619: when it starts chat?
[4:23:09] Demanisraar: Hard to keep up with two groups at the same time also I would think with all the crazy shit happening
[4:23:21] newkingcody: why are they doing an announcement so early in the morning ?
[4:23:25] AcidK: What did Naowh twit?
[4:23:35] fillefaren: No matter how harsh it was, he was certainly right imo
[4:23:36] DrakeDuude: thats how u do it. u learn as you go
[4:23:38] PulseOnline: Yep but look at the difference of PVP Casting VS MDI.  Big difference
[4:23:40] Gingerprimer: tbf that is most epsorts casters
[4:23:43] SirMouSe: "nerdy shit" ?! I strongly disagree with that - good casters should be able to do both
[4:23:43] Arthur_eld: @needaplug China
[4:23:47] ditaern: @Fortvila Hard disagree, you need both or the casting is shallow.
[4:23:49] Neowanderer: miss the slooty casting
[4:23:57] Bladerdiblaat: I don't get why anyone of us should care about this it all.
[4:23:59] Truthseeker96: I just watch to see how the teams compete and see what they do to win
[4:24:05] Mistery836: Just feel like wow is too dang complicated for the average person to understand wtf is going on LUL compare that to league of legends and even some1 who doesn't play will sorta get what is happening
[4:24:08] pavepawns: @Towelliee theres been an interview regarding possibly adding a tank spec in the future.
[4:24:11] pavepawns: to the evoker
[4:24:21] fillefaren: Yea you are right about that for sure
[4:24:24] Bladerdiblaat: Let him have his opinion and talk about it with the casters. The drama has nothing to do with us
[4:24:41] ditaern: If you keep it private, it never changes because of hubris.
[4:24:43] minael1: entitled twats. what can you expect?
[4:24:59] Daikanatv: shouldn't you keep it to yourself as well instead of publicly talking about it? same thing really
[4:25:03] Bladerdiblaat: It becomes more hubris because of all the opinions
[4:25:13] Mistery836: @ditaern nah. people just start shouting everything from twitter nowadays
[4:25:16] AssassinKhal: they have a history of making twitter posts instead of talking to the people so nothings new
[4:25:21] DrakeDuude: oooooo towlie calling it out like it is.. agreed big dog. i agree
[4:25:24] pavepawns: yes
[4:25:33] pavepawns: i can link it
[4:25:43] luckfore: dragon tank POGGERS

[4:26:11] ditaern: @ditaern For the opinions of how public events go, yes.
[4:26:12] Mistery836: oh it's a translated page
[4:26:13] pavepawns: its the translated interview
[4:26:52] manmower: would be silly if they added a 3rd spec to evoker before DH
[4:26:53] Mistery836: it's a legal no LUL
[4:26:55] TakMaggy: Holy cow you were up early!
[4:26:58] mmrghost7: thats a polite no
[4:27:00] Korupcija_: there is a raid format question too
[4:27:12] Clicklesly: They're also asking about Dracthyr, not the Evoker ^^
[4:27:19] lith1995: @manmower dh really doesnt need one
[4:27:20] NEMERL: DH healer KEKW
[4:27:24] romere_db: Thoughts on what the Diablo Immortal news will be?
[4:27:25] Ezekyler: Blizzard consideres considering players considerations Kappa
[4:27:34] Igorko_L: they would consider possibility to change booba size and update char. customization :)
[4:27:37] skyelez: same man that shit has been in dev for soooo long LUL
[4:27:49] Armdel: the same way they are considering player feedback Kappa
[4:27:52] Fubarlogixx: you have to logg out then logg back in
[4:27:53] minael1: do we really need a new tank though? we just got one in legion.
[4:27:55] FallenxGabe: It says June 30 in App Store
[4:27:56] Truthseeker96: @manmower what new spec would DH get tho cuz they dont need anything nor can they heal or range dps
[4:27:57] Rottencoarse: isnt it the bear and the spider? @Towelliee ?
[4:28:05] fillefaren: lets hope naowh doesnt get cancelled for that lol
[4:28:06] Igorko_L: and also update some models, belf closely looks like from minecraft, you have to wear xmog to hide it
[4:28:12] Praetour: Ranged tank pog
[4:28:22] Mistery836: I'm certainly gonna try the new class from the start
[4:28:28] Kelticlore: dh needs a ranged spec imo
[4:28:29] Heyhowsitgoingtonight: #cancelnaowh
[4:28:34] Mistery836: but i will have my other classes rready too LUL
[4:28:40] akia03: or they just put some tank abilities in the talent tree
[4:28:42] Relic7: I was wqatching Growl when Naowh tweeted that - and Xyro and Dratnos were in Discord.
[4:28:43] manmower: @truthseeker96 classes can have more than one melee spec
[4:28:49] Clicklesly: The casters did approach him and he deleted the initial tweet ^^
[4:28:52] allyooppp: What did Naow say?
[4:28:57] Feta_Cheez: @imbadkekw is there a clip of what naowh said ?
[4:29:02] ArcaneSyntax: what tweet?
[4:29:24] Rottencoarse: it was a tweet which he deleted guys
[4:29:28] Rottencoarse: movce on
[4:29:28] Relic7: Naowh basically said that the casters weren't doing a good enough of job explaining to viewers the plays and strategies that teams were using and said it had to improve.
[4:29:33] Rottencoarse: *move on
[4:29:42] Relic7: At which point the casters came out and tried to defend their approach but said they were open to feedback etc.
[4:29:46] Pippinn: @towelliee follow the river east and then follow the river south
[4:29:56] Relic7: It felt a little hostile from Naowh, going straight onto Social Media and saying that and not approaching the casters directly
[4:30:10] Feta_Cheez: how is that offensive enough to get cancelled
[4:30:12] Feta_Cheez: lmao
[4:30:17] Truthseeker96: @manmower oh yea thats right they only have two specs. Never played a dh before so i didnt know.
[4:30:19] ArcaneSyntax: ah okay, that's not that bad lmao
[4:30:26] AssassinKhal: no one is saying hes getting cancelled
[4:30:28] Relic7: @Feta_Cheez It's not, it was a just a little out of whack, but nothing major.
[4:30:55] akia03: didnt dh used to have 3 specs?
[4:30:57] manmower: @truthseeker96 probably would enjoy them revamping old specs instead of creating new ones, we have so many specs atm
[4:31:13] rosina_scarlett: @akia03 no
[4:31:14] Kelticlore: @akia03 no

[4:31:18] mikejames01: no
[4:31:20] Truthseeker96: always just the two specs
[4:31:20] assman_ny: 2
[4:31:23] GK_DSYNC: @akia03 dhs never had 3 specs
[4:31:24] akia03: like in alpha or beta
[4:31:24] lith1995: @akia03 no XD
[4:31:24] Igorko_L: no
[4:31:26] manmower: 3rd DH spec - Angst
[4:31:27] Shurn_82: they announced it before the release, but it was only 2 ever released
[4:31:27] Gingerprimer: They had kind of plans for a healer spec
[4:31:28] harpdarp: Yea they had 3 specs when it was called warlock KEKW
[4:31:30] Fortvila: they used to be demonology but also in the WL class
[4:31:59] DrakeDuude: I think the third DH class he is referring to is the original Demo lol
[4:32:16] NEMERL: Shaman Tank incoming
[4:32:20] Cristiex2012: can you solo mythic legion raids at 250 ilvl?
[4:32:21] AureliusXV: literally all three new classes that came out are tank specs
[4:32:27] ArcaneSyntax: I think there's a bigger chance that Dracthyr get more classes before Evoker gets a tank spec
[4:32:40] Rictue: !alpha

[4:32:51] Gingerprimer: KJ is a fucking ass to do still
[4:32:59] Clicklesly: Think the issue is more about introducing a brand new class that can't tank since there's a lack of tanks already
[4:33:00] Truthseeker96: we havent had any new range dps classes yet have we?
[4:33:03] Truthseeker96: i cant think of any
[4:33:12] Rictue: when do you think they release 10.0

[4:34:30] Kelticlore: shadowmeld @towelliee
[4:34:34] frastly: last two classes what were added had melee and tank tree so it makes sense to do caster and healer

[4:34:58] mmrghost7: no tank = no thank u
[4:35:09] DaSnailKing: Glad we have another mail
[4:35:35] dabam0: Do we know if the dracthyr can be other classes outside of evoker?
[4:35:38] Attackroot: im glad for  another mail user. and ready to try a new healer.
[4:35:50] Attackroot: only evoker
[4:36:05] dabam0: Wasn’t sure. Thank you
[4:36:07] akia03: maybe mail gets some good looking armor now
[4:36:10] Attackroot: they confirmed that  on  the announcement
[4:36:12] Pippinn: finally a new ranged spec
[4:36:12] Cardback: is this a survival hunter?
[4:36:29] Zendero89: @Cardback yes
[4:36:36] Viprekht: @dabam0 dracthyr could be an evoker only and an evoker is a drakthyr only as well
[4:36:40] Truthseeker96: all the hero classes have tank specs + melee specs. and now blizzard says they dont wanna add more melee to the game. so evoker def works since its a range class. Plus we need more range dps/healers. I mean it all makes sense now xD
[4:36:43] dabam0: I work nights an was asleep during the announcement @attackroot
[4:36:54] TheCliffyShow: I just had a thought. Wouldn't it be crazy if in Dragonflight the Infinite Dragonflight figure out a way to bring Galakrond from the past into the present.
[4:36:55] Kelticlore: if they had given evoker a tank spec would be first mail class to have a tank spec
[4:37:00] Truthseeker96: im such slow typer sorry
[4:37:02] nixxy_7: evoker feels like a shaman with but charge ups... has mail check... looks like draenei checl///  has range aoe skills like resto shaman and ele shaman check!!
[4:37:12] Attackroot: @dabam0 same. lol
[4:37:42] Attackroot: 6p-6a  6-7days a week lol
[4:37:46] QuantumleaperGG: survival also
[4:37:56] dabam0: @attackroot same
[4:37:58] bawheid: 6 tank specs is too many
[4:37:58] BeatTheDevilOut: yeah they converted survival over too lol
[4:38:06] manmower: survival needs black arrow back
[4:38:10] Truthseeker96: i hate that they turned survival into melee smh
[4:38:11] Genilort: I would love to see some kind of illiuonist class
[4:38:25] cgolden1a: wildstar engineer tanking in dragonflight lol

[4:46:46] nixxy_7: A lot of mobile games from KR that are top of the line rpg games that can even beat most games nowadays require soo much resources that people use PC for example

[4:55:16] DrakeDuude: 33 hours is respectable not too much not too little
[4:55:17] KingSlayerYotam: so with 2 hours a day, you need 2 weeks to get to max lvl, and how many more until ZM ? oof

[4:56:00] Jimstur: char*
[4:56:09] iainbrux: @Towelliee I recently returned to WoW, absolute farce that you have to complete the campaign when you're already 60 and then do some 9.1 content to then get to ZM - should be available when you just 60
[4:56:09] clickuletz: so this is dragonlight alpha?
[4:56:29] RayzeAUT: after you completed the campaign on another char would you be able to skip it?
[4:56:51] Jimstur: 33 hours... lets say real casual maybe have 1 - 2 hours available/day... that is still a pretty long time to grind your way to max lvl
[4:56:52] KingSlayerYotam: it will take longer for people who dont know the basic and routes of every thing
[4:56:57] Carahail: @RayzeAUT once he does it on this one,if he makes another toon they can use skips

[5:17:27] CuresEighty: Lost Ark laughs heartily tho
[5:17:33] Jessethoth: "Not everyone has a good phone, so here's PC!"
[5:17:38] Wastingmoney: My birthday is june 3rd pogo
[5:17:41] sakura_2020: @needaplug wallpaper engine on steam

[5:17:47] TheCliffyShow: Dude, where can I get that background?
[5:17:56] Zettabyte: Me too
[5:18:05] Kisswani: Wallpaper Engine I guess
[5:18:07] GunnyShavedPaws: Lost Ark stonks ⬇️ Lost Ark stonks ⬇️ Lost Ark stonks ⬇️
[5:18:08] CuresEighty: a lvl 10 story dungeon in LA is better than the whole diablo series ^^
[5:18:08] DeanoTV: background is on wallpaper engine, on steam
[5:18:11] xXSiebzehnXx: Grats !
[5:18:16] Jimstur: I just love the fact the guy was insinuating they planned for pc all along... like no you didn't....
[5:18:19] Screamnsteam: @bonita_aurelia you can get it. It’s the steam wallpaper engine, just search dragonblight
[5:18:19] ArcaneSyntax: I mean why wouldn't anyone try it lol, it's free.
[5:18:20] tomcio_76: now time to wait for june 2
[5:18:24] mrvic0: @towelliee do u think WoW DF would be the game's redemption?
[5:18:27] Aidler: the guy had a lot to endure since his “you have phones”… now he finally dropped the mic and had his redemption

[5:18:35] nixxy_7: wasd is gonna soo weird for everyone.... we are not used to it
[5:18:42] nixxy_7: everyone is a noob at wasd
[5:18:47] Malarick: going to feel weird
[5:18:49] Bogzeh: there were a bunch of ppl asking for wasd in lost ark forums, they got laughed out
[5:18:50] TheGaoSora: I don't see Immortal on my bnet 🤔
[5:18:50] sulleyc: I think you guys are easily impressed or maybe I'm just spoiled.
[5:18:51] ChiefMango: Not great, not terrible
[5:18:52] Alkamez: Pagan Online use WASD for it's gameplay
[5:18:53] BfAleTitan: there are some good ARPGs that use WASD
[5:18:54] Balkep: @Towelliee it will probably work like a dual stick action game
[5:18:54] TeejayOCE: Im scared for wasd
[5:18:57] TheRenderGaming: Lost Ark might just have to listen to the players that have been asking for WASD now... maybe? hm...
[5:19:00] bagrain: feel like they will bring WASD to diablo 4
[5:19:01] calimond: works fine for something like Hades so should translate to Diablo too
[5:19:06] ENCRYPTEDAMF: were playing maple story nowwith WASD LOL, we wont need a mouse haha
[5:19:11] Qargory: ive signed up, never played diablo before, it looked good
[5:19:12] cubanezu19: oh no, that sucks
[5:19:13] Moobot: ARMS_WARRlOR, Just for the time being we will be automatically removing any "Pay to Win" comments regardless of context to clean up chat while we play Lost Ark. Sorry for the inconvenience!
[5:19:16] minael1: if its free, micro is ok
[5:19:20] Krelivane_: Holy crap that's my wallpaper haha
[5:19:20] Xender21: my brain not big enough for wasd and mouse target seperately at same time
[5:19:22] Rayzorhail: Doesnt this put Diablo 4 in a wierd spot
[5:19:23] Jessethoth: Fuck nah
[5:19:25] memnon94: I think so
[5:19:25] marcuusjj: hope so
[5:19:25] Ziddrax: nope
[5:19:25] Jimstur: yes pls
[5:19:25] KaisenSiru: Bnet balance use Pog
[5:19:25] pavepawns: oh deffo
[5:19:26] theFirstAidKit: Well if you have an addictive personality you might want to skip most F2P games.
[5:19:26] flebbooo: oooh truuue
[5:19:29] iLanky: I think it might
[5:19:30] madbombz_fth: hope so
[5:19:30] ronireformed: LULW free
[5:19:30] Shifty_CZ: probably
[5:19:30] pavepawns: i 100% think so
[5:19:31] MrKhanes: Could be a test for that
[5:19:31] Aquadriel: optional maybe ye
[5:19:32] Vandumont: I'm fairly certain Lost Ark has a wasd function, not that I've tried it
[5:19:33] maldgoat: its going to be pumpd up to 1 place on the app store in mather of secs when its free
[5:19:37] JohnnyBoySilver: It was optional right?
[5:19:39] Rytten: Optional at best
[5:19:42] nixxy_7: @Towelliee i think this was microsoft involvement since Microsoft bought blizzard this changes are kinda showing off Wow Expansion now this... i think Microsoft buying Blizz was a good choice
[5:19:45] Screamnsteam: @arms_warrlor KEKW
[5:19:50] samiwamiAEYOE: I just think he meant WASD as in its on the old PC. Not that you're moving like in WoW. Or am I missing something? @Towelliee
[5:19:54] TigasLIVE: what addon was that? @Towelliee
[5:19:58] bonitaamariaa: i really want the background :(
[5:19:58] pavepawns: whats the point in spending time on it for diablo immortal if not rdying it for diablo 4 too
[5:20:06] Lasidor: IT probably has WASD because its porting in from a phone.  It was probably easier to manipulate the movement.
[5:20:08] Arms_Warrior: Screamnsteam u know it
[5:20:09] Aquadriel: no
[5:20:10] nixxy_7: hmm
[5:20:15] Korupcija_: it's all Mike! PogChamp
[5:20:16] Alkamez: Well WASD for an isometric game pretty much makes it a Twin Stick game, so if you've ever played a twin stick game on PC with keyboard and mouse that's how it plays
[5:20:17] Zettabyte: And tomorrow is the start of the OW2 beta..Blizzard is busy!
[5:20:17] maldgoat: they just collecting cash
[5:20:19] Banjo586: deal is a year away
[5:20:20] bonitaamariaa: so t rue
[5:20:21] pavepawns: this is backlash that caused the pc to happen
[5:20:22] G0ntor: The sale is not even finalized
[5:20:23] Killarod: it will be hype for a week then back to lost ark EZ
[5:20:24] bonitaamariaa: I agree
[5:20:26] Aidler: it’s mike
[5:20:26] Skkold: Microsoft legally cannot do anything to Blizzard atm
[5:20:26] KaisenSiru: YEP
[5:20:28] Kisswani: it's Ybarra personally Kappa
[5:20:29] MrKhanes: @Nixieed That deal isnt done yet, its 1 year away

[5:20:54] TnTsKyHiGh: Yeah I wasn't going to play on mobile
[5:20:58] gergtrongaming: I wasn’t on phone
[5:20:59] DrakeDuude: The phone guy redeemed himself
[5:20:59] JackHealMe: This was a less asshole POS environment decision, people who care about the games are in charge now
[5:20:59] vikktor556: smartest move they could have made
[5:21:00] Ordicos: yeah i am was going to be the first diablo i miss because it was on phone
[5:21:04] Alepouditsa: @BfAleTitan me to
[5:21:05] valianya: Controller support is forward thinking for console sub
[5:21:08] dimitex: @Towelliee I love what the Watt's ark was complete, when he stated whether you have phones or not!
[5:21:12] dreamwalker213: I might actually play it because of wasd. I hate click to move
[5:21:12] GunnyShavedPaws: Yeah, probably going to try it now. Big brain move Blizzard 🧠
[5:21:12] SirMouSe: Still not gonna play it - but mostly just because I dont have time for it :P
[5:21:12] michaelkn: How long til Diablo stream starts guys?
[5:21:15] coldhandsbeatz: They should have put it into Switch too
[5:21:18] h_u_r_k_: will my ipod play this?
[5:21:18] tomcio_76: WASDA

[5:21:29] Alkamez: Personally i was gonna play it, granted mostly on the pooper but now I can put more time into it cause it's on PC :p
[5:21:31] pavepawns: new world we live in
[5:21:32] Frozenpt: Exclusivity is not the way to go anymore when it comes to gaming platforms.
[5:21:33] vikktor556: KEKW
[5:21:33] nixxy_7: @coldhandsbeatz aw god switch... holy molly the lagg will kill it
[5:21:34] JackHealMe: Think it comfirms D4 to have WASD?
[5:21:35] Charon080: cathycatToast
[5:21:43] Krelborn: I was gonna play on pc anyway, but the crossplay means i might acutally get it on my phone
[5:21:43] FR4NCO: man just hope D4 had it also
[5:21:44] tomcio_76: dont you have phones
[5:21:47] BfAleTitan: can't wait to play on pc, then on my phone for poops

[5:21:56] darakor_sc: the only game i might play is D4 and if its shit i will never play a blizzard game again :D
[5:21:57] DiiscoViking: curious how much bandwidth is needed for mobile? Inflight diablo gaming??
[5:21:59] pavepawns: do you guys not have phones? : hell nah i threw mine away when you announced pc port
[5:21:59] Alepouditsa: my mom was goin to play it on her ipad
[5:22:12] mrniceguy817: So they made a mobile quality game then ported it to pc or the pc version will be an upgrade?
[5:22:15] bonitaamariaa: hahahha
[5:22:15] Amarlian: WASD is nice for sure, but Playing diablo on controller feels so nice anyway
[5:22:18] Charon080: lmao
[5:22:18] bonitaamariaa: hahahhahahahaahah
[5:22:19] Jimstur: you had me at taking a long shit bro!
[5:22:24] sifer007: can i play it on my microwave`?
[5:22:24] conv3rge_: peak efficiency
[5:22:24] CullenPrime: It's illegal for Microsoft to do anything like make changes in Activision Blizzard before the buyout is complete.
[5:22:24] ace7y: !GUNNER
[5:22:24] Kisswani: That's the Meta POGGERS
[5:22:25] MammothGB: True gamer moment

[5:22:40] RPClipsGTA: 20-30 mins on the toilet enjoy your hemorrhoids
[5:22:41] G0ntor: 30 minutes sitting on the poop throne?????????? That is some exploit. Still feel your toes at that point?
[5:22:41] GunnyShavedPaws: 💩 💩 💩
[5:22:43] KragnosWoW: rip people who bought a new phone for this KEKW

[5:23:11] skyelez: anyone know when the pc open beta starts?
[5:23:12] newkingcody: HE SAID PHONES KEKW
[5:23:13] dimitex: They learned!
[5:23:15] KingSlayerYotam: Short and to the point
[5:23:16] Jessethoth: @black8mamba23 Someone with bowel problems like IBS? Or maybe they ate a lot of cheese?
[5:23:19] dimitex: Blizzard AI real
[5:23:20] harvanas: still awfull Management from Blizz that they even wanted to do a pure mobile game
[5:23:22] SilentStormAU: is it free? 🤔
[5:23:22] Rottencoarse: @Towelliee  now we need a D4 announcement :P
[5:23:23] BfAleTitan: 100% the reason for the delay
[5:23:24] CowCook: 100%
[5:23:24] MaylingDF: they dont undestand their playerbase
[5:23:29] Alegnowar: in the latest earning presentation they said 30Mil players have pre-registered for diablo immortal
[5:23:29] thymos_: covid
[5:23:31] iLanky: I would think its a big chunk of the reason
[5:23:34] TheRenderGaming: Id imagine its definitely related to the backlash
[5:23:35] Carahail: they thought they knew better...they've had Humble pie since then
[5:23:35] FallenxGabe: Any chance for switch release?
[5:23:41] BfAleTitan: the mobile game has been "finished" for atleast a year
[5:23:45] Crowzcut: switch lol
[5:23:46] Orthobullet: The blizzcon reaction i bet had a big impact on it
[5:23:47] Belasard: wonder what would have happend if the sentence "dont you guys have phones" ended with... "no problem, it comes to pc also"
[5:23:53] bagrain: they saw the reaction and said oh crap get this on pc now
[5:24:00] GiveLoveLive: Warcraft mobile in august maybe then?
[5:24:06] memnon94: @baldrge true
[5:24:08] its_andyd: neatgangdotcom subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 44 months, currently on a 32 month streak! towHAMUP
[5:24:13] Aspectt10: @MaylingDF They don't even have a playerbase yet
[5:24:13] MammothGB: famous last words
[5:24:21] Luxembourger: do we know already when the alpha begins?
[5:24:23] Videntess: @Towelliee where did u get the animated screen
[5:24:25] Croxssis: There is an armor set that will unlock if 30 million pre register
[5:24:29] Jessethoth: I just really hope the Mobile Warcraft goes back to RTS...I wan't Warcraft 3 mobile. That'd be the shit.
[5:24:35] Jessethoth: I would accept an ARPG or w/e. though.
[5:24:38] wildwittra: mobile pet-battles ?
[5:24:40] GabrielKD: I am guessing they repurposed it entirely too, initially it probably had a different monetization scheme and connected gameplay/systems to cater to it. I still wonder what the monetization will actually be in detail, I'd be surprised if you can't buy progression and power (progression means power)
[5:24:46] thymos_: no people wanted D4
[5:24:52] thymos_: @Nixieed
[5:25:01] GiveLoveLive: Oh damn that’s right.
[5:25:03] memnon94: probably 2030
[5:25:08] Negative_Ion: @Videntess look up wallpaper engine on steam
[5:25:11] CowCook: im sure the monetization will suck
[5:25:11] Skrapp: wow, they announced it 4 years ago? I swear it was last year lol. Where is the time?
[5:25:13] BfAleTitan: yea if its F2P on PC no reason to change it
[5:25:17] Lasidor: Wait, what about a Warcraft game?
[5:25:19] vikktor556: "dont you people have credit cards?" lmao
[5:25:21] coldhandsbeatz: Im pretty sure it was mentioned in an earnings call or something like that that Warcraft mobile game was coming this year 2022
[5:25:25] GiveLoveLive: Can’t believe it’s been that long
[5:25:28] GiveLoveLive: Nuts
[5:25:32] MetaKuron: Probably no Lootboxes since all the stuff is ready to pre register in Belgium and the Netherlands currently?
[5:25:33] Jimstur: a china first game
[5:25:47] Heyhowsitgoingtonight: will you buy the battlepass?
[5:25:56] KragnosWoW: There is  A LOT of blizzard fanboys that will cash out on it
[5:25:58] Crowzcut: i buy it
[5:26:01] Xender21: everyone will buy 1st month
[5:26:05] Moobot: Banjo586, Just for the time being we will be automatically removing any "Pay to Win" comments regardless of context to clean up chat while we play Lost Ark. Sorry for the inconvenience!
[5:26:07] bondsmatthew: could see d4 have a battlepass too if its successful
[5:26:14] Xender21: will get too attatched to quality of life battlepass options
[5:26:28] Shadow_Phoenix_Gaming: Shadow_Phoenix_Gaming subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 47 months! 
[5:26:36] FallenxGabe: It will be a must
[5:26:36] Belasard: i hope this means, warcraft mobile will also be playable on pc. so you are free where you want to play and when.
[5:26:40] Shadow_Phoenix_Gaming: now the question is will it have drops
[5:26:59] simonbgg: Will Diablo Immortal be free?
[5:27:04] Fortvila: I bet its gonna be way worse than lost ark
[5:27:05] GiveLoveLive: @baldrge hope so
[5:27:05] SavageGaz: new to wow what application should i use mods wow up or curse forge?
[5:27:12] CritcobainTV: towHAMUP
[5:27:13] Fortvila: i bet you will be able to buy real gear for money
[5:27:16] PsykosysGG: He knows
[5:27:25] Heyhowsitgoingtonight: All Blizzard games should be on PC, they built their entire company on PC
[5:27:27] GiveLoveLive: He knows
[5:27:32] Demanisraar: @SavageGaz I use WowUp
[5:27:42] banezy: @SavageGaz i use curse and works fine
[5:27:58] Xender21: it's not even that, lost ark free to play is super inconvenient on inventory and things
[5:28:01] GabrielKD: You can skip months of progression with a few swiped of the credit card in Lost Ark, I imagine Immortal won't be quite like that :D
[5:28:02] Demanisraar: @SavageGaz Only because curseforge runs on Overwolf and Overwolf is ass
[5:28:05] GunnyShavedPaws: Jokes on them, people buy gold from elsewhere EleGiggle
[5:28:17] nixxy_7: @Towelliee LostArk is pay too skip  because a lot of people dont have that much time to grind and play or only play a few hours so you can skip the grind with money and that creates gelousy among f2p players
[5:28:34] KaisenSiru: YEP
[5:28:37] Shatraugh: 5Head
[5:28:37] Jessethoth: @Fortvila What I remember they said of it, it was more like, you could buy more "runs" through certain types or rifts or some shit, I think they're going for the "You can grind it all with points or pay".
[5:28:39] Lazugo: pretty much
[5:28:41] TheAbraxas94: very likely
[5:28:44] Luquatic: @Towelliee what do you think of the new UI design?

[5:29:23] Luquatic: @TheCliffyShow search it in the wallpaper engine library
[5:29:32] Jessethoth: @Nixieed I dunno, maybe I see the spectrum differently because I play both ARPG and MMOs.

[5:32:26] nixxy_7: @Towelliee i cant really blame blizz for  trying to make mobile games like other companies adapting ; its not just because its the new era its because in 2019 FateGrandOrder had over 4 billion $ revenue that shocked entire gaming industry how a mobile game had more earnings then any title and its since then most companies try to make mobile platform viable :)

[5:34:09] nixxy_7: @HijarL Yes Epic Seven in 2020-2021 reached top googleplay store nr.1 game most popular in EU and NA stores and it reached closed to FGO revenue but nobody could beat FGO , koreans/chinese/japanese people invest soo much into mobile games were not even 5% of them in ayear
[5:34:16] brilargaming: @Reckless_Monk Okay, thx
[5:34:27] 3663Sharad: Just watched  the Diablo Immortal video... very cool stuff. playing on pc, mouse and so fourth

[5:36:11] Alepouditsa: now the have diablo imortal on the games in the lancher
[5:36:13] nixxy_7: @HijarL yea exactly but the problem is its hard to adapt on WEST side mobile platform becausae people are not prone to paying weekly or monthly cash into games and spend htat much unless its PC or 4k so asians are mostly working a lot traveling a lot so mobile games is 90% of they`re investment unlike us that we focus PC/console on EU/NA but i think people will adapt in time
[5:36:19] Reckless_Monk: @brilar1967 ah, alot of wallpapers to look through thats for sure :P
[5:36:22] Tokies: Yoooo
