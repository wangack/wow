[1:03:43] bainzy2ezy: when your on the selling tab, just go through your inventory on the left of the ah
[1:04:01] mikey9988: i need that addon lol
[1:04:22] mikey9988: default AH is bad
[1:06:12] stillsuitstk: boon is good for leveling (running speed is very pog)
[1:07:16] savke3: care of allis they like snakes
[1:07:48] mikey9988: KEKW
[1:07:57] thebigdc_: rhymes with bone bolf

[1:10:08] stillsuitstk: on invis
[1:10:13] stillsuitstk: you need to click
[1:10:48] stillsuitstk: pretty sure but you can try
[1:11:25] Echo_Esports: Yooo i yoinked a Staforge PC. Best choice of my life . Go yoink yours at: echogg.ly/starforge/Scripe
[1:11:37] stillsuitstk: dungeon grind
[1:11:38] mikey9988: dungeon spamming
[1:11:48] stillsuitstk: sayuwuYikes
[1:11:59] joggetur: 5 mages
[1:12:05] stillsuitstk: aoe pumpers and big pulls setup
[1:12:06] mikey9988: 3 mages 1 priest
[1:12:11] mikey9988: 4 man on my server
[1:12:26] stillsuitstk: mages always drink, fak em
[1:12:32] stillsuitstk: warlocks are better
[1:12:43] stillsuitstk: thats my experience :3
[1:12:56] MavisMayhem: shadow priest spellcleave lowkey might be the fastest
[1:12:59] stillsuitstk: but most of the classes have decent aoe now
[1:13:01] mikey9988: mage just does way more than lock
[1:13:22] mikey9988: mindsear goes brrr
[1:13:24] stillsuitstk: shadow priest are pumpers now too
[1:13:39] mikey9988: fixed
[1:13:43] stillsuitstk: they fixed it
[1:14:02] MavisMayhem: spriest aoe damage is actually really high, and they don't need to drink, so even though the damage is slightly lower, its potentially faster
[1:14:28] mikey9988: Deadge
[1:14:30] MavisMayhem: don't have proof though, just an observation
[1:14:32] mikey9988: oh wow
[1:14:45] stillsuitstk: are you dirty bois from alliance? shaman tank is the best addition to your mage-cleave parties
[1:15:03] stillsuitstk: fire nova rune + slow totem
[1:15:12] mikey9988: sadly yes
[1:15:28] MavisMayhem: I've done it with warrior, lock and shammy tank, and shammy is for sure the best aoe threat
[1:16:00] stillsuitstk: where are the EALS?
[1:18:12] stillsuitstk: you kinda need a healer, but yes mage heal can work too
[1:18:55] stillsuitstk: I never met mage healers in p2 tbh
[1:20:07] mikey9988: some say they are still oom @stillsuitstk
[1:20:55] MavisMayhem: @Scripe You started at the right time btw, they literally just made it so mages can make 10 water per cast instead of 2
[1:21:21] MavisMayhem: and will be 20 per cast next reset
[1:21:22] Echo_Esports: Time for a break...from your current job? Come work with Echo! Apply at: echogg.ly/apply/Scripe
[1:22:07] mikey9988: they nerfed the living flame heals by 80%, so it feels kinda meh
[1:22:27] mikey9988: yes
[1:22:29] MavisMayhem: yes
[1:23:48] MavisMayhem: ngl, I dunno how that living flame healing survived past the first wave of nerfs, I was sweating leveling so much more p1 because I assumed it would be hotfixed day 1
[1:25:14] mikey9988: fun detected
[1:25:37] stillsuitstk: often
[1:25:39] stillsuitstk: everyone leveling
[1:25:46] mikey9988: a lot of people are still leveling alts with BFD
[1:25:58] MavisMayhem: @mikey9988 you have to admit, it was  egregiously broken
[1:26:11] stillsuitstk: there is also new mage scrolls that allow you to port to PLAYER (party membert) (if he is in ANY inn)
[1:26:26] mikey9988: yes, tanking an entire instance was definitely broken
[1:26:44] mikey9988: EZ Clap
[1:27:14] stillsuitstk: a couple of hours ahead yea
[1:27:30] stillsuitstk: ALSO use your drums

[1:29:04] stillsuitstk: it's a weekly quest for them but yea
[1:29:38] mikey9988: ashenvale starting soon monkaW
[1:30:08] stillsuitstk: you gain rep
[1:30:08] mikey9988: no, mainly for rep
[1:30:12] stillsuitstk: not sure about exp
[1:30:30] stillsuitstk: friendly you can buy a mount for ashenvale
[1:30:46] stillsuitstk: but waste of the money rn tbh
[1:30:47] mikey9988: too expensive now tho lol @stillsuitstk
[1:31:10] stillsuitstk: @mikey9988 Yep with you sayuwuKevin

[1:34:27] mikey9988: it does, u can stack boon and new buff
[1:34:34] stillsuitstk: insane
[1:34:57] mikey9988: it's 4% crit and 42 spell power for the 2nd buff, really good for casters
[1:38:11] mikey9988: Kappa
[1:38:25] stillsuitstk: horde always lost on purpose!
[1:38:30] stillsuitstk: master plan

[1:39:19] pricebanana: Scripe looking handsome today
[1:39:21] MavisMayhem: yeah by far
[1:39:39] MavisMayhem: except gnome has way too much trash
[1:39:52] MavisMayhem: having a 30 minute raid every 3 days was chill
[1:40:38] stillsuitstk: yeah useless trash once again
[1:40:43] stillsuitstk: we wiped yday on trash actually lol
[1:40:52] stillsuitstk: in the tunnel before last boss
[1:40:55] stillsuitstk: you know the place
[1:41:04] stillsuitstk: someone pulled bottom
[1:41:09] stillsuitstk: and we all died :3

[1:41:45] mikey9988: a lot of it, instance takes like 2hrs
[1:41:46] MavisMayhem: there's just a lot of it
[1:42:04] stillsuitstk: last boss is a 7 min battle for me
[1:42:11] MavisMayhem: bro, there's a loooot of trash and they don't just fall over like the BFD trash, they have like 15k hp per mob

[1:45:54] fabbsan: yee met him on retail and he was playing vdh in my key. Just curious who it was
[1:46:04] mikey9988: quest chain starting in barrens
[1:46:35] MavisMayhem: everyone's poor because new crafted shit is expensive
[1:46:42] mikey9988: yes it is a turn in quest that rewards neck similar to bfd trinket reward
[1:46:51] Eliannoula: imagine its tempel of atal hakkai or how its called
[1:46:58] stillsuitstk: yes wait until someone finishes, but in the morning it's not very often
[1:47:22] stillsuitstk: only OG players have finished Gnomer anyway!
[1:48:38] stillsuitstk: RN for sure
[1:48:44] stillsuitstk: it actually requires tactic
[1:49:00] stillsuitstk: not just mindless slapping of the target dummies
[1:49:00] keijihanda: KEKW
[1:49:15] Tldybi: a new guild? say no more, come to us :P
[1:49:52] stillsuitstk: recruit echo back to the horde
[1:50:06] MavisMayhem: Gnome is harder. The bosses live longer, and have more mechanics.
[1:50:25] stillsuitstk: and bosses slaps SO hard
[1:50:33] MavisMayhem: funnily enough, the last boss has a full raid one shot mechanic

[1:56:14] MavisMayhem: they were oneshotting people wit starsurge, but they got nerfed
[1:56:35] MavisMayhem: spriest is probably the biggest offender in pvp right now
[1:58:51] Vodkaamix: @Scripe  do you like that we go crit on fire mage
[1:59:12] MavisMayhem: I think its worth it, spriest is in a really good spot right now

[2:02:07] stillsuitstk: you want RFK boar spam

[2:17:19] stillsuitstk: non aoe is bad for sure
[2:17:26] stillsuitstk: yeah boars in RFK
[2:18:08] MavisMayhem: I can't speak for the average quality of pugs since I had a premade, but it for sure isn't worth it if the comp is scuffed

[2:50:21] Echo_Esports: Time for a break...from your current job? Come work with Echo! Apply at: echogg.ly/apply/Scripe
[2:50:42] stillsuitstk: you clear up to the 30 lvl mobs i guess (after 2nd/3rd boss)
[2:50:47] Kemskemss: tbh I’m struggling more with learning roles and positions. and since they overlap it makes it worse. Like someone picks Nocturne and doesn’t say a thing. Is he top? jungler? how the fuck do I know
[2:52:09] GngrWoW: Hey Scripe. I have a question for you. How does Echo's failure in AWC affect Echo the business? If at all? Was very disappointing.
[2:52:17] Kemskemss: well, I have to start somewhere :D and it doesn’t say in blind pick
[2:52:18] stillsuitstk: SADGE

[2:54:37] Kemskemss: @GngrWoW isn’t it what people want? a lot of peeps complaining when one team wins all
[2:54:48] stillsuitstk: @Scripe bro this group isn't great
[2:55:02] GngrWoW: @Kemskemss Oh for the audience it was epic. Brilliant entertainment.
[2:55:20] Sorojaki: yep
[2:55:22] stillsuitstk: yeah
[2:55:25] stillsuitstk: its scans chat
