[4:52:06] roflpotamus: thats why rogues deadly brew is so good windfury
[4:52:39] Coresmoke420: So, turns out that Shamans can combine Rockbiter with Windfury, Flametongue, or Frostbrand by using the power of spell batching. To do this, you need to have Rockbiter active and cast whatever other Imbue when you're about to hit your opponent. Unfortunately, because this relies on spell batching it will just fail to work sometimes.
