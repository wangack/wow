[0:11:04] t4pekid: Cat Streamers Variety arc peepoHappy
[0:11:05] Blloood: any game is boring AF if you break it down like that
[0:11:06] kitty_cast: That's why you use magic
[0:11:15] Blloood: healing is looking at bars and pressing ur heal if it goes down
[0:11:20] t4pekid: wow is literally cookie clicker
[0:11:28] SurfSalsa: yeah just go sorcerer like i did FeelsStrongMan
[0:11:42] Blloood: you can...
[0:11:48] Blloood: you can one shot bosses, if ur good enough
[0:11:55] Blloood: people finish these games in 30 min
[0:12:01] Blloood: 2 hours glitchless
[0:12:14] Indormi: Elden ring has a lot of accesibility stuff, if you use all the tools the game gives you its not hard. (Summons, magic etc)
[0:12:14] Blloood: what u mean u cant dictate how u play? LUL
[0:12:21] mixtapeX: Come on Now is the best name and logo LMAO
[0:12:23] kitty_cast: True just don't get hit bro
[0:12:27] Blloood: i mean, shit talk. But atleast be accurate
[0:12:48] epilepticunicorn_: you are fundamentally misunderstand what growl is saying and getting mad about it
[0:13:01] SurfSalsa: growl speaks the truth
[0:13:01] sergentjugs: i think you offended Blloood lol
[0:13:02] Silencbank: have we even seen one throne of the tides this entire mdi?  was there one last week?
[0:13:14] Blloood: yes, its called GETTING GUD!
[0:13:25] Blloood: and the faster U GET GUD! the faster u can kill bosses
[0:14:06] Blloood: damn, dude is hitting and throwing fire balls
[0:14:10] Blloood: what cheese xD
[0:14:14] Indormi: In elden ring at the start the issue a lot of new players have is they become stubborn with the first bosses you encounter. Where is much better to explore a bit and then come back.
[0:14:21] LordWhiskey1: i mean, how is that different than m+
[0:14:33] inspectical: Yumy how bad is ele shaman atm for m+ gonna try wow for the first time and that class looks fun
[0:14:34] autumnbugle: where did all these people come from?!?
[0:14:42] incyer: Elden ring is much better cause you can do stuff other than sword man
[0:14:46] Valanya11: YEP its just like wow raiding
[0:14:49] SurfSalsa: if in m+ you had to stop casting more than 50 percent of the time that would be mega frustrating
[0:14:55] War_Pap: Yea its wow raiding with one person
[0:14:58] Ebonhawke7: isnt that the same as a M+ boss?
[0:15:01] Blloood: I cant belive somone who does m+ where u do the same boss with the same mechanics 2000 times
[0:15:06] fryta214: !ui

[0:15:13] LordWhiskey1: its called stopping dps :)
[0:15:14] Mindris_: not all bosses are like that
[0:15:16] theskot: yea just timing combat
[0:15:21] Dylz101: its got great story as well
[0:15:28] autumnbugle: is there an alarm that sounds?
[0:15:33] somancy: Dark Souls fanboys are so insecure LuL
[0:15:33] Blloood: its fine if it dosnt intrest u, then dont play it
[0:15:37] War_Pap: Yes the whole game is like that, its patterns and learning the patterns
[0:15:38] theskot: there should be a bigwigs noise when you need to dodge
[0:15:38] starbuckviper: tbh i found ER much easier than DS3 - I actually completed ER and only got to like 2nd boss on DS3. So its more forgiving, which is nice, but its still solid as well
[0:15:45] Blloood: but if ur gonna talk shit atleast be accurate xD

[0:18:17] Blloood: ye, see how it feels?
[0:18:31] War_Pap: You know why everyone likes the Z2H series? Because they get to relate to shitty group play in your videos at low to mid lvl keys. Also the massive prevenable wipes

[4:46:59] ExiledAng3L: max is cancelled for saying he doesn't care about content

[4:48:18] DogShitPaladin: bone buds
[4:48:43] gloomygl: As opposed to the non-consent meta ?
[4:49:02] the_shadow_squad: JB doesn't understand that you are supposed to ask for consent before you touch things.
[4:49:12] xRakii787: @n0s0upbr0 buds bashing eachother and a random twitch chatter doing it are a bit different
[4:49:15] Thowarr: HE'S PAST HIS BEDTIME
[4:49:37] wastedheals: submit MDT for approval before run KEKW
[4:49:45] n0s0upbr0: @xrakii787 read chat brotherrrrrr it’s universal

[4:54:22] WolfL1nk: protectors
[4:54:50] Ajatus: this is gorak
[4:55:38] Ajatus: thats troll to do rezan again
[4:56:14] incyer: They got the graphic so need to use it
[4:56:39] SCMSV: Why does tettles have that crash bandicoot fit, orange shirt and blue shorts
[4:57:15] FrabjousDaze: someone take JB out of the kitchen
[4:57:18] jbenson444: TBP > MDI and it's not even close
[4:57:22] haselforst: ^
[4:57:24] Ajatus: @SCMSV brother thats red not orange

[4:57:47] n0s0upbr0: at all
[4:57:48] Thowarr: JB COOKING WITH NUKES
[4:57:48] jbenson444: RWF is not about being relatable, it's a one time t hing
[4:57:49] n0s0upbr0: he’s so fucking right
[4:57:50] marionberry88: I've had tons of tanks overpull trash and we wipe, it's totally relatable
[4:57:50] simplepathwow: same boss KEKW
[4:57:55] commandpostkyle: JB has so much energy its unreal
[4:57:57] n0s0upbr0: he’s sooo fucking right jdotb wins
[4:57:58] icculus86: Finally, he's cooking
[4:57:59] DogShitPaladin: JB just shot em dead
[4:58:00] Zempre: damn I was gonna disagree with jb but then he said that
[4:58:03] Adrang: less than 0.5% of players even step into a 25
[4:58:04] Twizited: AAAA
[4:58:09] BigTrout3: NFL isn't relatable and it's obscenely popular
[4:58:12] n0s0upbr0: there’s nothing relatable about RWF
[4:58:14] Thowarr: Max doing a Goku powerup; we'll see him in 6 episodes
[4:58:19] Adrang: mdi level keys are still really high for most people
[4:58:28] Juicewolff: seeds…
[4:58:30] pony_waifu: max took the L HOLY
[4:58:31] numenusty: I enjoy more TGP than MDI and I don't watch the world first
[4:59:03] haselforst: @Adrang @Adrang THIS is what ppl forget
[4:59:14] DogShitPaladin: yeah but Echo almost lost to Last minute in the cup right before
[4:59:19] silmarilen: tgp > mdi and it's not even close
[4:59:19] simplepathwow: Deadge
[4:59:24] WolfL1nk: enhance
[4:59:25] LuiBMHunter: I love echo for all there amazing strats and tricks
[4:59:27] RamblingJosh_: It's easy to understand wiping to a hard mechanic or getting clobbered by a hard key, nobody has the experience of fighting for seconds on the clock
[4:59:40] NotDage: is that real money?
[4:59:41] WolfL1nk: HOLY
[4:59:44] glutton420: is that real money?
[4:59:44] matteomontanna: lets goo
[4:59:45] NotDage: or fake
[4:59:46] teegx: HOLY

[4:59:53] Hymmer: GAMBA
[5:00:01] matteomontanna: who wastes time playing with fake money
[5:00:03] matteomontanna: kek
[5:00:11] jenkinsdonuttv: A bit late but on the relatable argument... would you guys get in a stadium with 20k+ people to watch garage league football?
[5:00:45] blort___: exclusively, definately not about absorbing greens from different places
[5:01:10] icculus86: TGP is help back by the viewing experience.  Trying to watch anything more than 2 teams at a time (and even that's pushing it) is nonsense cause it's too small
[5:01:18] Viking2512: @jenkinsdonuttv the most visited match in our soccer league is the two worst teams playing each other as they cannot win against any other team KEKW
[5:01:33] RamblingJosh_: TGP leans on the casters a lot
[5:01:49] numenusty: TGP should be on live keys
[5:02:08] Thowarr: Mandatory: STRAT CHECK!
[5:02:09] Ajatus: dryad pull dg Prayge
[5:02:12] glutton420: What app does growl play poker on?
[5:02:24] HolmesRN: have we seen a single Throne all tourney?
[5:02:35] Adrang: @jenkinsdonuttv I think this is kind of it, but because max isnt thinking relatable, but accessible. People dont really know what goes into any of the things the teams have to do to pull off these pulls. But in pro sports, people can understand and appreicate the athleticism of the players
[5:02:47] matteomontanna: acr
[5:02:47] Ajatus: didnt they also have to like push up from a 20 to a 24 to start the day?
[5:02:49] Axmaster55: xdd
[5:02:50] t4pekid: !ad
[5:02:58] F3ly: as long as there is no exploit-discussion going on during the TGP it is absolutly bombing
[5:03:07] F3ly: that was shit in the first TGP
[5:03:12] glutton420: @matteomontanna ty
[5:03:49] AyeLoud: the real bone bud resurrected
[5:04:18] jbenson444: mandatory playing like they're angry
[5:04:36] Thowarr: Playing like all their strats were approved beforehand
[5:04:45] Ajatus: honestly mandatory getting punished for dropping rxh aka pxh aka psycho
[5:05:23] jenkinsdonuttv: @Adrang Accessible would be a more appropriate term IMO as well, so people can at least understand what's going on. ''relatable'' is more like ''I could do this''. But yeah agree with you theree
[5:05:34] ZappCatt: You gotta be there to capitalize if they do screw up....trying to get close by adding more difficulty
[5:05:51] gova17: @Ajatus did he leaves or the team get rid of him ?
[5:06:44] AvalenaTV: LFM MDI practice no leaver 2,4k rio+
[5:06:46] JGTheStorytime: @yumytv /chat Balatro having issues launching for y'all?
[5:06:57] BigTrout3: you make friends too
[5:07:00] Adrang: ill take that as a W
[5:07:05] ZappCatt: gotta get teh banner toy! Do it every time
[5:07:12] jenkinsdonuttv: @BigTrout3 Friends? What is this?
[5:08:00] icculus86: Just make dispels baseline
[5:08:10] BigTrout3: warriors PepeLa
[5:08:13] jenkinsdonuttv: Just give warriors dispells, ggs
[5:08:13] n0s0upbr0: yeah they’re good cuz they make u think about taking another class instead of the meta slut class
[5:08:23] n0s0upbr0: I fucking hate meta slut bags
[5:08:43] Nuublet: i think warriors like not being able to do anything, boys just wanna zug zug
[5:08:44] jenkinsdonuttv: Like a ''curing cry'' AoE disease dispell
[5:08:49] bigchurchman: cries in zug zug
[5:09:01] AvalenaTV: Oldge
[5:09:02] ShaggySummers: I just need arms to be easy/good so I have a decent off specc for my tank
[5:09:06] ClipCraft: i miss seasonal
[5:09:14] Thowarr: "now that I'm old" boy hasn't hit 30; doesn't even have curlies
[5:09:28] drdrozd12: growl is full boomer
[5:09:34] Oleka: downers are always gonna be downers
[5:09:37] indigo_octopus: growl's 57
[5:09:37] RamblingJosh_: Feels like there's no point having a talent tree if you don't have a reason to change it for some fights
[5:09:42] FrabjousDaze: chatter doesnt know Sadge
[5:09:44] jenkinsdonuttv: Growl's 69
[5:09:44] Nuublet: he plays classic, must be at least 45
[5:09:50] ShaggySummers: in my head growl is like 32
[5:09:51] drdrozd12: growl feeels young now
[5:10:00] incyer: Growl is jb old
[5:10:03] michael: I just don't understand the motivation of keeping things like bolstering/sanguine around, that clearly hurt their play time metrics. Not sure who it is benefiting
[5:10:04] jenkinsdonuttv: Growl becoming Grump
[5:10:06] AvalenaTV: in my head growl times 32!
[5:10:17] drdrozd12: growl is like JB/Jeathe age
[5:10:24] OatsAtMidnight: I have a random question, why is stormkeeper on Resto shaman considered good? Isn't It just exchanging two casts for one cast and two GCDs?
[5:10:38] pony_waifu: growl is streaming from the retirement home Sadge
[5:10:48] AvalenaTV: wasnt JB around somewhere when the pyramids were built?
[5:10:49] DarkVoice_: 11:25 was bandits time
[5:10:51] drdrozd12: growl has grandkids
[5:11:02] jenkinsdonuttv: @pony_waifu They're letting gramps stream on Twitch? sick retirement home
[5:11:27] Ajatus: @OatsAtMidnight its 5 casts worth of damage in 3 globals

[5:25:00] Ajatus: they pulled the casters onto witherbark
[5:25:08] AyeLoud: aaah shit nice
[5:25:20] Dotctori: I think timestrike can pull from very far
[5:25:27] theskot: maybe that guy is lying
[5:25:54] Viking2512: I mean they def got it approved after yesterday...
[5:26:28] MierkaBlue: but there is a wall between this boss and whiterbark that dosnt go away before this boss dies. so how is that okay and pet pulling in DHT was not?
[5:26:57] darthritus: xyro is based
[5:26:58] Ajatus: cat-ster
[5:27:04] kitty_cast: do it

[5:27:08] IAttackYou: you cant be saying that shit
[5:27:09] Lolgoat: Gotta be on camera though

[5:27:31] MierkaBlue: @Viking2512 yeah yeah, I know, I  just wonder the consistency of both rule set and ruling itself
[5:27:33] Dotctori: Oh I thought the end game is pretty close already
[5:27:35] IAttackYou: @Sunchaser_911 cant be us

[5:28:16] vondahanner: Don't be hating on us old people  - I"m way older than JB and I play Wow  :-)
[5:28:18] AvalenaTV: JB was there when gnarlroot was still a seedling
[5:28:19] Viking2512: @MierkaBlue I think they wanted to have more of a let them cook mentality this year. Teams just have to submit the tech
[5:28:23] simplepathwow: would have to do face reveal as caster Susge
[5:29:09] ShaggySummers: So when Max gets the Growl and Dorki tattoo, how does he plan to incorporate JB?
[5:29:21] Ajatus: lol the observer loading screen fucks with the party frame overlay

[5:58:20] Ajatus: max completely ignoring that it took literally 5 minutes to get that set up and eclipse was able to just finish the dungeon in that time instead
[5:58:25] AyeLoud: @yumytv i have a vid of the tech, some dude posted it a while ago on reddit. Can i post a link?
[5:58:50] epilepticunicorn_: @Ajatus well they did wipe to the first boss they were already like 5min behind

[6:02:37] talkley: what was the pull
[6:02:44] baseboned: kinda like echo in brackenhide.....
[6:02:50] Hyvest: It's just jumping around the dungeon in the end
[6:02:54] AvalenaTV: that intern that gave green light to that strat surely will get in struggles now
[6:02:56] Viking2512: mandatory didn't ask tho
[6:02:59] nightbreeze93: but the difference with mandatory is that they didn't ask right?
[6:03:08] baseboned: blizz admns being inconsistant idiots???? NO WAYYYYY
[6:03:23] mawji_: @sugarshorts skipped the rp pack before second boss brh, pulled the hallway past the rock stairs, pulled rp pack, scavenger pack, onto second boss
[6:03:27] baseboned: last hope asked about the mandatory pull and were told no
[6:03:39] Lolgoat: If the boss isn't pulled yet when the group is pulled, it's not through a wall thourhg right?
[6:03:57] talkley: they dont care about group B
[6:04:06] satansskitplattform: well tbh, how are they supposed to be consistent in their decisionmaking, if the strats ppl find are wayyy out of expected interractions
[6:04:46] SpikeyC: classic 'blizzard guy'
[6:05:00] Silverwards: godamnit Kotick

[6:10:37] baseboned: Max is an S tier not listener
[6:10:52] EmElw: talking and listening is a zero sum game
[6:11:04] AyeLoud: Can't res in this room for some reason
[6:11:09] AyeLoud: The mobs just interrupt
[6:11:19] AyeLoud: well guess you can, wtf xD
[6:11:32] Aandromega: raid HUHH
[6:11:34] baseboned: I dont have to respect Kungen
[6:11:45] AyeLoud: LUL
[6:11:53] baseboned: the clips of him playing classic, are ALSO wild as shit
[6:11:56] BigTrout3: I would agree with that take
[6:12:14] satansskitplattform: Max is a nice guy, but hes also the guy that considers his own opinions as facts, and that others' ppls opinions are factually wrong
[6:12:32] imafk__: why do they pull the boss to the middle of the room?
[6:13:11] BigTrout3: I'm at the point where it's taking real long to progress and level up and get talents
[6:13:18] haselforst: Bedge
[6:13:33] baseboned: I literally cant play rumble, the game freezes at 100% loading every time I tried
[6:13:51] RamblingJosh_: shak is a blessing to humanity
[6:13:58] AvalenaTV: summon tec?
[6:14:01] MimiBear21: eclipse cooking

[6:14:46] AvalenaTV: spriest no sum?
[6:15:01] beast2: how did they instantly mark it
[6:15:29] beast2: oo
[6:16:29] MierkaBlue: 18 seconds is a lot in mdi timers
[6:16:38] AvalenaTV: these mobs feel so terrible on high fort bolstering
[6:17:16] RamblingJosh_: mega dungeons kinda stinky, can't even tell which boss is in which dungeon in the journal
[6:17:36] JulesMcSwaggerak: lol
[6:17:41] BigTrout3: yeah, look at how much of the rp they cut out before s3
[6:17:43] AvalenaTV: dunno tazavesh gambit was turbo fun as destru lock :D
[6:17:45] shultsy: they didnt have m+ in mind when making spires? D:
[6:17:49] baseboned: the mega dungeon was incredibly cool on first play tho
[6:17:49] JulesMcSwaggerak: mage got murderd, saved with a blink
[6:17:57] yllib12: it's considered in the fact that there is a good way to split in in two
[6:18:09] yllib12: otherwise they don't consider m+
[6:19:07] RamblingJosh_: it's pretty funny how chromie says she doesn't have time to explain though, lol
[6:19:33] Nolbear1724: Lets do an all mega dungeon season wooo
[6:19:34] MierkaBlue: I would love to see some statistics (and blizz will never show those), because I find it interesting that m+ is supposedly "the most popular game mode" and yet  "most players never play m+"
[6:19:52] AvalenaTV: upper khara was decent, lower was just terrible with all the wall and floor pulls
[6:19:58] AvalenaTV: and the carpets, fuckin carpets

[6:20:45] MierkaBlue: yeah, I get that, I just would love to see the statistics of players and engagement on different content (I used to do that part as my job).
[6:20:57] Vyndrodis: shadowlands pvp Despairge
[6:21:11] Aandromega: Time walking weekly is a good example
[6:21:14] RamblingJosh_: the main thing they always say on the topic is that, almost everyone plays a wide range of content
[6:21:24] ShaggySummers: I enjoy m+ when we're still figuring stuff out. By the time we "get" the dungeons and are doing 20s, I'm checked out usually
[6:21:31] rufus_aus: any balatro mains?
