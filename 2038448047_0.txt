[4:07:08] haldaz: But is there no CD on buffs in era then?
[4:07:58] Jehiren: The current can travel, but the signal to noise ratio is far worse. The signal degrades over distance far faster in copper than light in fiber.
[4:08:31] miestyman: Do you see anyone else out leveling?
[4:08:47] Jehiren: Plus you can put multiple signals per fiber line and they don't interfere, so more bandwidth. For copper, you can't do that because the signals will interfere.
[4:09:31] Jehiren: Yeah, you can't pick the signal out. It's why ethernet caables are only so long, or usb, or hdmi.

[4:12:09] Fireclipz: they would call is witchery
[4:12:15] Fireclipz: it
[4:12:16] jorgenand: They use some pretty advanced techniques to modulate the signal into many different wavelengths, instead of just 0 or 1, which essentially means your signal carries more data. Simularily to using decimal over binary, and hexidecimal etc.. Each "Symbol" has more unique values, and can carry more data.
[4:12:23] Jehiren: Even more crazy is how cell service actually works.
[4:12:37] Balruk_: well when you put it like that it kinda is magic
