[1:35:19] PaEu: blizzard stock has been good for me, buying the dips
[1:35:24] Cowardpatty: Because there isn't nearly enough money in the world, it would be nearly impossible for Dogecoin to reach $100. Every $1 increase in the Dogecoin price would necessitate an additional $180 billion in 2030. To reach $100 by 2030, Dogecoin would need to have $18 trillion invested in it.
[1:35:25] swiftyhealer: @Swifty there 3 resubs

[2:02:43] neevir: 1k a month is cheap
[2:02:50] Sweet_Lou__: people do not understand how bad the housing and cost of living situation is

[2:04:27] s0rlandet: Bro you can IRL stream
[2:04:31] Dissuxx: @GekkoSoldier Don't live in the US :(
[2:04:37] Grouwdi: it's weird people drop subs that fast. They forget gamers have lives lol
[2:04:37] Metalcalfe: 4X20% = 80% lol
[2:04:48] Boroborgeran: wrath is out? nice!
[2:04:54] Grouwdi: Starlink - IS EPIC!!!!!!!!!! OMG

[2:05:13] Kaosgor: @Boroborgeran No it isn't out yet FeelsBadMan
[2:05:23] greypilgrimz: starlink speed is about 40down
[2:05:25] Metalcalfe: Is the upload speed on starlink fast enough to stream?
[2:05:39] Boroborgeran: ah ok @kaosgor  it looks so much like it. ptr or soemthing then
[2:05:49] Boroborgeran: i guess swifty is doing his prot warr then
[2:05:50] neevir: bring the disk with you

[2:06:21] Gismo150: why not stream IRL
[2:06:22] Grouwdi: depends on Starlink package 20Mbps and up
[2:06:33] Xirucio: SWYFTIEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE HeyGuys HeyGuys
[2:06:37] Metalcalfe: Satellite internet upload speed used to be dialup speed only a few years ago, so I'm not sure what starlink is.
[2:07:07] shaoruto: that's dope i'll have to look into that
[2:07:09] itzsamhoyle: starlink is pretty fast according to some of the snippets ive seen
[2:07:14] itzsamhoyle: not at all like dial up
[2:07:22] EliBourne: The data shows that on average, Starlink users in the U.S. saw roughly 75 Mbps in download speeds, 10 Mbps in upload speeds and 56 milliseconds (ms) in latency. When compared to the results from last year, all three mark for drops from the 141 Mbps in download, 20 Mbps in upload and 51 ms in latency. However, diving a bit deeper into the data shows that Starlink's efforts to reduce latency are bearing fruit.
[2:07:38] TrickDunn: What TBC Classic Server (s) are you playing on these days?
[2:08:09] dreadlord786: congrats on your marriage swifty
[2:08:25] Metalcalfe: 20Mbps is terrible, but I don't think you could stream 1080p on that.

[2:39:10] Boroborgeran: haha how about swimming or rowing?
[2:39:10] leowinns: Are you starting a new char @Swifty
[2:39:38] Metalcalfe: I love swimming but I hate public pools LOL
[2:39:40] Boroborgeran: running is pretty meh especially since its bad for your knees
[2:39:47] WILDBLOOD: hey man what server are you on?
[2:39:53] Boroborgeran: but i still run cus i cant swim
[2:39:54] boomstick093: Is it worth it to transfer with tokens ?
[2:40:04] madvaca: mounts
[2:40:06] Boroborgeran: that well
[2:40:07] yaji42069: gold
[2:40:13] Magraith: I'm quite annoyed tbc won't be immortalised like they did with classic
[2:40:17] boomstick093: And How much retail gold, do you need to get like 20000g in tbc?
[2:40:21] Metalcalfe: Swimming's easy, just kick your legs
[2:40:25] Magraith: maybe get fresh tbc servers in future idk
[2:40:27] notmelan: and after wrath? ppl back to retail?
[2:40:28] Boroborgeran: i guess its hard to go swimming anywhere else
[2:40:37] TrickDunn: It really is an equitable way of resolving loot though. People really don’t like the RNG aspect of loot.  If you don’t walk out with loot you walk out with gold, that you can spend next time.
[2:40:41] Metalcalfe: @Boroborgeran Sometimes I do the stairs in my apartment building
[2:41:00] TrickDunn: Loot Council is BiS— but that isn’t a reality in a PUG
[2:41:07] Boroborgeran: hehe youre right i actually forget to kick gotta remember that the next time. i took a mini swim in the ocean today and just did dog swimming
[2:41:15] slickyricky_92: everyone wins in a gdkp

[2:41:32] Fooxfire: its good if you have the gold for it
[2:41:33] TrickDunn: I’m doing NAXX gdkps on Faerlina, and they’re selling Ashbringers for 10k
[2:41:40] madmax84: i hate it
[2:41:46] madmax84: it ruin the game i think
[2:41:56] Welshscott: what addon was that lol
[2:41:57] daxypoo71: side crawl is great for ocean
[2:41:57] ryanblue98: all the gold buyers baited and banned
[2:42:00] TrickDunn: The RNG part just isn’t fun about /roll for determining loot in my experience
[2:42:05] Metalcalfe: @Boroborgeran Swimming is 90's legs
[2:42:10] madmax84: yea
[2:42:11] domino_pr: what do you bench swifty
[2:42:11] Metalcalfe: 90% rather
[2:42:17] ultaego: Anyone who played b4 . And watched as other players rolled on gear they had and won . Would rather a gdkp
[2:42:20] Boroborgeran: stairs are like my favorite thing in urban areas
[2:42:27] madmax84: join raid guild like everyone els
[2:42:30] TrickDunn: GDKP isn’t inherently bad— it’s Gold buying. It’d still exist even without gold buying/selling methinks
[2:42:32] doobiesnacksi: Raiding guild. On benediction. got a spot for you homie ;)
[2:42:34] Sweet_Lou__: it ruined the game but it generats Blizz money so they dont give a crap about it
[2:42:42] Boroborgeran: holy i didnt know that
[2:42:59] boomstick093: Will you be playing anything Els then warrior in wrath?😁
[2:42:59] madmax84: or just roll in a pugg, i realy hate GDKP
[2:43:04] TrickDunn: It’s a great accessible way to PUG and not feel meh after a raid where you just don’t roll well
[2:43:13] Boroborgeran: its like revelation for me :)
[2:43:23] notmelan: what do u think will happen after wrath tho, it seems like they cant grab more money after that
[2:43:30] Metalcalfe: @Boroborgeran Just remember to point your toes down, so they act like flippers
[2:43:37] zilzag: you gonna do any tbc arena
[2:43:38] TrickDunn: Made 950g in a NAXX gdkp last night
