[0:18:46] Ujai321: greatly, and not at all
[0:18:51] eziekiyah: much like the skeleton in the Last Unicorn, I alwasys assumed undead ate regular food but it just runs off of them
[0:18:53] chefdejour82: so much gold
[0:19:00] Ujai321: that's not true, there is no mission table anymore
[0:19:16] mattzomix: soloing raids in bfa still don't work :(
[0:19:24] IAmScarlett__: but yeah

[0:19:34] thordallim: this is archeo but badly redone, jus tlike th eproffesions
[0:20:23] Zuldak: this part is like that one WQ in maldraxas to find the eyes
[0:20:36] eielwind: well that certainly wasnt working that way right on patch launch yesterday lmao
[0:21:47] Zuldak: i dont mind it. Once you understand how it works its not bad at all.

[0:23:19] GamingRiggz: Chat question. Worgen or human for pirate rogue. Opinions?
[0:23:55] Ujai321: wolf smell really bad when their fur gets wet, and pirates are constantly at sea
[0:23:56] GreenArrowed: @rlggz89 worgen i guess. but also like. kul tiran :(

[0:25:54] traktordestrucktor: thats horrible :O
[0:26:02] Zuldak: more fire
[0:26:09] poprawka_: black hazel <3
[0:26:14] CanadianHeavy: I did all this yesterday and not a fan
[0:26:15] josdael: What is this xD
[0:26:16] eielwind: don’t worry the world event isn’t like this
[0:26:16] Zuldak: it is fussy yeah
[0:26:20] GreenArrowed: it seems fussy
[0:26:20] sence_00: yah it is just fussy
[0:26:26] sence_00: but it gets a little easier
[0:26:31] Zuldak: fussy is the perfect word for it
[0:26:36] Ujai321: WHAT? hazel doesnt like the new thing!?
[0:26:39] CanadianHeavy: but the follower dungeon was nice
[0:26:49] traktordestrucktor: I Like cats
[0:26:52] GreenArrowed: ooooooooooh follower dungeons!
[0:26:57] morphexia: follower dungeon are amazing>!
[0:26:59] eielwind: you don’t have to finish the quests to do the event
[0:27:00] Zuldak: yes
[0:27:04] chefdejour82: yes
[0:27:08] morphexia: but i didnt get any drop
[0:27:10] relicxhunter: you can
[0:27:10] Zuldak: you can solo farm a dungeon yes
[0:27:12] GreenArrowed: amazing
[0:27:14] syriusdots: yes
[0:27:24] Zuldak: it does drop on normal
[0:27:25] eielwind: that was my question too Hazel haha
[0:27:27] syriusdots: yes it does on normal
[0:27:27] Harai_Ulfsark: yes it drops in normal
[0:27:33] relicxhunter: It drops on all difficulties :))
[0:27:36] Marovia: it can drops to followers and then the followers use it, its cool
[0:27:39] GreenArrowed: amazing, less socializing for me
[0:27:41] anker_jym: I had to wake up at 4:00 AM and walk up hill, in the snow, both ways, to get to the stream, but I'm here dangit!!
[0:27:48] eziekiyah: I wanna say mrgm got one this morning

[0:28:11] SNAKEBOMBS22: what do you need them for?
[0:28:24] holymommades: it's a cool mount
[0:28:32] leeetlemouse: moorrning! hope youre staying warm and safe with the overnight snow dump lol
[0:28:33] jeffdmk: This wig is really growing on me
[0:28:34] Zuldak: Ive seen people report that if youre the tank and wipe the group the followers all drop party. All thats missing is the 'gg tank' whispers
[0:28:35] mattzomix: oh that quast was kinda broken for me
[0:28:37] jgbrit: Instant dps queues.. let's gooo
[0:28:40] Ujai321: so if the school is behind a hill, you would technically have to walk uphill bith ways, right
[0:28:45] eielwind: did you get the lizis reins mount?
[0:29:03] hectorian01: Isnt this like a low key archeology revamp?? It feels like it
[0:29:09] eielwind: you can do the event before finishing the quests @hazelnuttygames
[0:29:34] jgbrit: Is there a time gate on the archives thing?
[0:29:34] tonibeeswax: good morning from LA!
[0:29:36] Ryok: @Zuldak yeah but when you release they respawn with you, it's kinda weird but i get why it's done that way
[0:29:45] poprawka_: now this looks perfect
[0:29:47] amaya21: i just realised the dragonriding mounts have some different abilities amongst them, like the gryffon doesn't have the twirl
[0:29:56] Marovia: follower dungeons are the perfect place to re introduce johnny awesome
[0:30:07] Ujai321: i want to know if you can let the bots auto farm the dungeons for you. just put a dot up every now and then
[0:30:17] Zuldak: oh! dragon riding in old world is so cool. You can ride all along the giant wall in pandaria
[0:30:34] Yin_AKA_Ethan: @HazelNuttyGames Heya Hazel! valaer1Wave Ohh, awesome hair choice!
[0:30:37] HappyBeeNoizes: sparkles :'(
[0:30:38] GreenArrowed: there's so much in this patch, i totally forgot
[0:30:52] GamingRiggz: Departos should be a DPS character in follower dungeon @hazelnuttygames
[0:30:53] Zuldak: i think the rock is supposed to be for the spawned silt things to despawn em
[0:30:55] kazzjenkins: o/
[0:31:10] anker_jym: Wow, this looks like a lot of fun! Blizzard should make a profession like this where we can go around surveying and digging up artifacts!! ....oh wait a minute
[0:31:12] tonibeeswax: a water elemental with a cowboy hat??
[0:31:22] anker_jym: I'm not bitter, you're bitter
[0:31:46] Ujai321: this really does feel like archeology. looting garbage with lots of extra steps
[0:32:07] jgbrit: Maybe the skull update IS archeology LUL
[0:32:08] DrSilly1093: There's something special about a good brain-off time sink
[0:32:12] jeffdmk: i forget did you get pond nettle?

[0:32:51] josdael: Enjoying the little things <3
[0:32:52] Woodled: Pond nettle took me 4400 casts
[0:33:12] GamingRiggz: Hazel have you done the Gilnean quests yet?
[0:33:47] jgbrit: I've just started farming Zul Gurub, I will *not* be beaten
[0:33:56] Yin_AKA_Ethan: @Woodled OOf
[0:34:10] Ryok: i just learned something today about the blue silken lining embelishment... if you have 2 of them they don't stack unless you unequip both items and equip them at the same time through a gear loadout D:
[0:34:18] Phenroi: This quest was buggy for me when lotsa of people were around
[0:34:18] anker_jym: The past two expansions have included factions that were exclusively made up of artifact collecting and learning about lore. I get that Blizz had to go with the majority, because objectively it really isn't a popular profession, I just miss it is all
[0:34:38] Zuldak: i think the idea is you're daming the water away from flooding it
[0:35:39] jeffdmk: hazel how did you get to be so expert on body disposal? that seems suspicious!
[0:36:03] Yin_AKA_Ethan: @jeffdmk Secret :p
[0:36:18] Ujai321: also, you have the knives out in arena
[0:36:22] Zuldak: Survivor first few seasons were lit
[0:36:23] amaya21: have they said anything about archeology on war within?
[0:36:27] Marovia: no JAG?
[0:36:27] anker_jym: Sure...she learned it by watching TV...
[0:36:34] Kurama__95: Man, that's what I watch with my dad LUL
[0:36:37] Ujai321: 2 seasons a year
[0:36:51] Marovia: ayoo the big D
[0:36:56] anker_jym: Btw, digging today's wig color!
[0:37:06] jeffdmk: That is 28 gold you get to spend on mog you will never use
[0:37:15] Ujai321: yeah, they are at Survivor season 44
[0:37:27] eielwind: it’s like the feast, stand there and wait
[0:37:28] Zuldak: you wait for him to give you a task. You can dig up the things around while you wait
[0:37:41] tonibeeswax: What questline is this??

[0:39:40] mrrazputin: @HazelNuttyGames did they removed old pet charms with 10.2.5 ?
[0:39:44] anker_jym: One of my guildies said their NPC tank overpulled and died in a follower dungeon last night lol
[0:39:53] Zuldak: you can help contribute while you wait by clicking the digs
[0:40:04] jgbrit: One one the surprises of 10.2.6 > Soar becoming dragon riding SeemsGood
[0:40:12] jgbrit: Its SO good
[0:40:21] aliceimpala: Ramen?
[0:40:27] Kurama__95: I like the soup because it gives me easy gold LUL
[0:40:29] Talonias: You can dig while you wait for tasks too

[0:43:08] Marovia: there are flyers over veldraken
[0:43:12] jgbrit: In the roasted ram inn
[0:43:26] OrganicPasta: the backpack is neat
[0:43:27] sence_00: you have to talk to the undead guy at their base before the public event works i think
[0:43:33] CanadianHeavy: cosmetic I think
[0:43:52] eielwind: almost all cosmetics and a mount
[0:43:55] onegunpete: hey all, happy Wednesday :)
[0:43:56] Zhenedra: I got a mount from the epic bag thingy you get
[0:44:21] eielwind: what epic bag?
[0:44:35] amaya21: hey kira!! <3
[0:44:57] Zhenedra: Cant remember the name of the mount
[0:45:36] Marovia: ayooo what
[0:45:50] Pathstrider: they need to buff tasks given like they did with the soup event. got only 1 task whole time
[0:46:00] CanadianHeavy: ya good rep and money
[0:46:14] Zhenedra: @eielwind From the page collection bar like 800/1000 you get an item, i got an epic item that had the mount
[0:46:16] Zuldak: the vendor for the fragments is back at the HQ in algathar academy
[0:46:37] Zuldak: thats where you can see the mogs
[0:46:40] eielwind: oh I thought they only gave fragments @zhenedra , good to know!
[0:47:04] sence_00: hmm seems like the dig completion might be accnt wide...just did it on an alt and didnt get the 5k
[0:47:07] Talonias: You need a total of 238,000 fragments to get everything
[0:47:14] Scyreth: i did just see someone get the hornstrider from the boss
[0:47:21] 7thSaga: LUL
[0:47:30] Ujai321: i cannot tell if 238k is a joke or not
[0:47:33] eielwind: why did you have to do that math for me @talonias
[0:47:37] L333_X: did u got fragments from the questline ? @HazelNuttyGames
[0:47:42] Talonias: The purple tomes also give tmog pieces
[0:47:44] Zuldak: yeah you cant scam the game and just run alts through the weekly to send over fragments... 5k weekly and then scraps from WQs
[0:48:08] Scyreth: yeah i got the tmog boots from the boss too
[0:48:10] Talonias: Sorry @eielwind, I figured it might help people plan
[0:48:14] Ace_Trekkie: Had the backpack drop from an epic tome and the belt from the Doomshadow boss
[0:48:26] jennyy385: is 10.2 fun? I stopped playing before it came out
[0:49:01] SmuggSauce: where do you get that bee again?
[0:49:19] SmuggSauce: oh that’s the beetle
[0:49:50] Zuldak: Horde arent salty at all about that bee mount being alliance only
[0:49:54] r3parker: I wish that bee mount could be used on my horde characters
[0:50:12] Zuldak: Kuafon is usable
[0:50:19] Ujai321: they are also, probably, not a bee
[0:50:23] ImaRayofFlippinSunshine: a teeny bit unfair
[0:50:24] Ujai321: or nearly as cool as a bee
[0:50:28] ghostie1995: I saw someone had the The Glazer equipped I was in awe because that honey wand is soo rare and expensive
[0:50:46] helheimr: there are some dinos you can get as a horde that works on alliance
[0:50:48] anker_jym: Hazel, have you watched The Big Kiss cinematic yet?
[0:50:50] dampen_harm: how much time does it take to get the bee mount again ?
[0:50:51] helheimr: but the bee is not for horde
[0:50:59] Zuldak: think the bee will get dynamic flying?
[0:51:03] Zuldak: the zoom bee
[0:51:27] For_Real_Real: For_Real_Real watched 3 consecutive streams this month and sparked a watch streak! morning hazel!
[0:51:38] Kurama__95: I want the pandaria disc to get dragonriding, it'll be like air skating LUL
[0:51:38] anker_jym: Amirdrassil epilogue quests. People are making a big deal because it's WoW's first on screen kiss

[0:52:19] Harai_Ulfsark: @Grez_1 most mounts are already done tbh, you can see a few animations on wowhead ptr page
[0:52:19] For_Real_Real: i thought there was a Thrall kiss with his wife after doing that elemental ritual thing.
[0:52:21] Chebits: tyrande and malfurion
[0:52:22] nanao2k: bee mount is alliance only because blizz tried attracting playerbase to play alliance in bfa
[0:52:31] erinnightz: tyrande and malfurion
[0:52:36] Marovia: a bit weird that they made anduin and genn kiss i did not think thats where that relationship going
[0:52:40] anker_jym: For real, it's a sweet cinematic, it's just funny that it's taken this long
[0:52:41] Grez_1: @Harai_Ulfsark ok thanks
[0:52:51] Zuldak: Jaina and Thrall....
[0:52:59] Chebits: they had a good lil family moment ;w;
[0:53:05] Ujai321: "it's been 500 years, it's time for our first kiss"
[0:53:07] Harai_Ulfsark: the gay frogs
[0:53:07] Chebits: it was really touching
[0:53:13] jeffdmk: I like the version where there are coordinates availiable but hazel refuses to use them
[0:53:17] Saiyori: wathion and anduin pls blizz kthx
[0:53:17] amaya21: I mean he just woke up he had morning breath :P
[0:53:18] nyrhalahotep: Tyrandes shoulders... swoon. 🥰
[0:53:18] Airthena: Lies, it's Mattias and Flynn!

[0:53:47] erinnightz: most of this patch cutscene made me cry a little bit
[0:53:48] sence_00: the top of the tower is bird-height and the entrance is below
[0:53:50] Saiyori: @Airthena i feel like flynn would do the leg upthing if they kissed
[0:53:56] For_Real_Real: i mean... if sylvanis didn't kiss anduin when she had the chance... id just be disappointed in her.
[0:53:58] Zuldak: its the bottom of the tower where the mini boss bvefore the bird is
[0:54:19] anker_jym: @richadin He swapped places with Ysera so she could come back temporarily. Once she went back to Shadowlands, Malf could come back
[0:54:42] morphexia: that story quest were pretty fast. for gilneas i mean
[0:54:49] Chebits: @Richadin after the raid, ysera was like "it's time for me to swap back" and then he was here.
[0:54:59] For_Real_Real: gilnaes is like 30min... it was nice but meh.  I really expected it to be longer and just "more" considering its hype.
[0:55:03] Ujai321: look how tiny you are on that mount
[0:55:19] Chebits: yeah, i wish the gilneas story was longer too :<
[0:55:29] Marovia: can you imagine they let us do follower dungeons with our warband
[0:56:08] mothwhowearslippers: Every day I come to the stream for 15 seconds and look at the color of the wig I believe one day we will see a dark red
[0:56:14] Zuldak: smash em with a candle stick

[0:56:36] OrganicPasta: Both maces are so sick

[0:56:44] L333_X: its arecolor of the recruting a friend t mog
[0:56:45] jakeisacat: Lumiere
[0:56:51] LolitaAldea: this is for housing in the future XD im sure!
[0:56:58] Zuldak: the question with the mace... if you sheeth it, does it burn your butt
[0:57:04] Zuldak: the torch mace
[0:57:11] DrSilly1093: Be Our Guest goes from invitation to threat
[0:57:12] Sarlyssia: evoker can use 2handed maces too
[0:57:25] Ujai321: 50 feet of rope is the best item in DnD, apparently
[0:57:32] Marovia: DO YOU WEAR WIGSS
[0:57:36] Thaxorin: is that a new character?
[0:57:39] mothwhowearslippers: @Ujai321 i love buzzcut but unicorn wig will be great too

[0:58:00] tonibeeswax: love the backpack
[0:58:06] Marovia: have you seen the wig interview with the hobbits
[0:58:13] Ujai321: look at the mount again
[0:58:18] Ujai321: you are so tiny
[0:58:19] tonibeeswax: sick mount
[0:58:21] Ujai321: amazing
[0:58:37] L333_X: it seems like u can do it on every alt
[0:58:37] Zuldak: omg that torch mace is sheethed upside down. It burns your butt
[0:58:40] fallingupwards: The quest hands on experience is bugged
[0:58:43] tonibeeswax: the gnome ponytail is so cute >o<
[0:58:58] beezelebaub: it's 238k fragments for all items D:
[0:59:22] OrganicPasta: I got the backpack, but it's a different color
[0:59:27] LolitaAldea: yeah they drop
[0:59:35] Zuldak: so i got a couple drops so far, but the bad news is that they seem to be different tints than that vendor has...
[0:59:35] eielwind: so at 5k per week how many weeks is that lol
[0:59:38] ryan4: cat Pog
[0:59:39] shaypressplay: I have gotten all clothing and back pieces from drops from event
[0:59:41] Jeansen: bf sats it drops different stuff ye
[0:59:43] rock769: the quest"The Big Traitor's Rest" dont allow dig, or give me any clue where we can do it.
[0:59:46] Jeansen: said
[0:59:48] Tegger37: their's a mog set that will drop that isn't on the vendor
[1:00:01] Marovia: girl math is not doing the math
[1:00:03] nashyblaze: doing the math is a great way to burn out before you even start lol
[1:00:06] OrganicPasta: I got a purple recolor of the "Historian Hefty Habersack"
[1:00:06] Ujai321: you can do it before TWW comes out
[1:00:08] Zuldak: so that means you need to get lucky with drops AND farm the fragments...
[1:00:10] Ujai321: i guess, i didnt check
[1:00:11] loralahla: my patch is stuck on "initializing" :(
[1:00:24] CeciliaWhite: I tried the npc follower dungeons.. it works pretty well..
[1:00:26] Jeansen: yea the drops are different colors he has done them all day
[1:00:48] ntdrongo: when i loaded battlenet, it said something about 'Seeds of Renewal' but in the shop. Now I can't find it
[1:01:33] jeffdmk: That way sucks because the optimal thing to do then is not spend the currency
[1:01:35] Esoteryc: Is this just like "New" Archeology?
[1:01:40] ntdrongo: well that's what i thought
[1:01:42] xzeeb1: Hi Hazel wait what how did your hair grow this much
[1:01:55] Arabany: Wait, a horde character can reclaim Gilneas as well, can't he?
[1:02:02] wolfcloudchaser80: Looks like my VPN is shadow muting me in stream... does my phone app work?

[1:02:05] Ujai321: !wig
[1:02:05] Streamlabs: it's a wig
[1:02:16] theonerune: yes
[1:02:28] Esoteryc: I mean it's neat. I'm here for it. lol
[1:02:30] morphexia: I does feel like they are testing new archeology! at least i hope so!
[1:02:31] sayit109: the quest say they open WQs in that area
[1:02:32] xzeeb1: ah looks nice
[1:02:44] Harai_Ulfsark: dance with her
[1:02:51] Harai_Ulfsark: Wowee
[1:02:53] sence_00: you unlock WQs
[1:03:02] sence_00: and the WQs are like these intro ones
[1:03:34] eielwind: wowhead just posted an article today agoutnit
[1:03:36] eielwind: about it
[1:03:55] GreenArrowed: my tank is lost in nokhud and i can't see them on the map love thiiis
[1:04:32] Tegger37: I'm doing it for the ring which also eventually earns a mount
[1:04:32] nashyblaze: nashyblaze subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 3 months! 
[1:04:32] Streamlabs: nashyblaze just subscribed with Twitch Prime!

[1:05:28] wolfcloudchaser80: Aka, Bonsai Dragon
[1:05:30] Thaxorin: I tried that dungeon and didn't get anything for it
[1:05:32] Miss_Nebulas: they are higher up
[1:05:33] xmalthael02: Top of the buildings :)
[1:05:36] Ryok: something i didn't know was follower dungeons had a big malus to exp gained per follower... they reduced it so it's only 5% per follower now... but as dps it's probably still better to spam those than queue for normal dungeons xD
[1:05:48] BoogiePonderosa: hi
[1:05:51] Stealy: You must be in snow though still, ice gone here finally raining, but very dark!
[1:05:58] cashthb: henlo

[1:06:30] wolfcloudchaser80: Oh,  Moose might get to play in snow?
[1:06:42] cashthb: they kinda are
[1:07:01] ntdrongo: where do you start the new quest
[1:07:06] anker_jym: If you find fun things to do outside during a heavy snowstorm, would that be considered Blizzard Entertainment?
[1:07:43] sence_00: I dont think they are unlocked accnt wide
[1:07:59] sence_00: snowshoeing is amazing
[1:08:11] Zuldak: PNW seems to get more ice than snow unless you go into the mountains
[1:08:22] xzeeb1: no its not I hate it
[1:08:27] judgejewls: Hi Hazel, could I please thank amaya21 for the gifted sub to your awesome channel?
[1:08:40] jakeisacat: my family up in WA go snow showing up on Mt. Rainier all the time.  it’s very relaxinf
[1:09:04] cashthb: did a backflip?
[1:09:16] Zuldak: did he roll in it?
[1:09:38] anker_jym: Good boi
[1:09:54] Ujai321: "i am 14% husky, it's fine guys"
[1:09:59] Zuldak: snow does not stop the search for the perfect stick
[1:10:04] Ujai321: is he 100 pounds yet?
[1:10:05] spicynooble: hi chat hi Hazel!
[1:10:18] ntdrongo: what is the item from algathar you said you were chasing
[1:10:37] Ujai321: eh, any day now
[1:11:09] Ujai321: you seem like you wouldnt bet on him not being 100 pounds yet. is he getting closer?
[1:11:25] wolfcloudchaser80: Oh man,  the helpful water elemental wears an Australian hat!
[1:11:32] Essiandar: Divine morning breath of Ohn'ahra
[1:11:41] Ujai321: so how much do you think you can deadlift? 100 pounds maybe?
[1:11:54] Perkolate: can you follower dungeon to get the nokhud offensive item now? for the mount
[1:11:59] cashthb: could you lift me?
[1:12:20] Stealy: thats a fox
[1:12:36] aliceimpala: @cashthb nice
[1:12:38] ghostie1995: flying squirrel!!
[1:12:38] BoogiePonderosa: fox/squirrel.. who can tell?
[1:12:47] Ujai321: you watched Everything Everywhere All At Once, right?
[1:13:00] Zuldak: oh yeah xylexia can also fly on her own now
[1:13:19] BoogiePonderosa: it's squirrelly
[1:13:20] theonerune: they might...but then what would the fox say?
[1:13:38] Stealy: Yeah I still have to complete my archeology on past expansion..it's a commitment for sure
[1:13:40] jeffdmk: that movie looks horrible
[1:14:05] goplacidly56: have you seen the new night elf area
[1:14:11] Ujai321: i bet you would love that movie. you love musicals
[1:14:12] anker_jym: Gosh, I haven't seen Mean Girls in years
[1:14:14] Miss_Nebulas: I want to see it too but not in theaters lol
[1:14:26] Esoteryc: The snark in that comment. lol
[1:14:36] ghostie1995: I want to get the tops of my fingers tattooed but I’m too young and employers might go “no”
[1:14:43] CyberLexie: CyberLexie subscribed with Prime. 
[1:14:43] Streamlabs: cyberlexie just subscribed with Twitch Prime!
[1:14:45] Ujai321: how many gift subs for you to go see it in theaters today?
[1:14:49] Zuldak: ive seen the first like... 30 min of mean girls
[1:14:53] cashthb: the new night elf area made my realize why the modern design is soo lame: they don't use colors
[1:15:00] Ujai321: i'm now quite interested how you like it
[1:15:15] Zuldak: In Portland i would have thought tattoos would be a requirement
[1:15:19] beefgoggles: beefgoggles subscribed with Prime. 
[1:15:19] Streamlabs: beefgoggles just subscribed with Twitch Prime!
[1:15:20] Ujai321: man that fox surely is 100 pounds by now
[1:15:27] IndigoCat: I never saw Mean Girls. I was beyond the age it was for when it came out and was too busy being a young mother.
[1:15:59] chefdejour82: saw something with Freckled tatoos being a thing
[1:16:10] persumerer: Where i live in Scandinavia we had a proper snow storm today, only emergency vehicles reccomended to be out in traffic
[1:16:34] mokorii: that concept is still weird to me I used to hate my freckles as a kid
[1:16:35] Perkolate: cue meatloaf
[1:16:35] Stealy: why is one of those pink the other blue?
[1:16:56] cashthb: sure frekles won't go out fashion in a few years, I better get them tattooed on my face
[1:17:04] KaruptTed: snow day for comox valley
[1:17:04] focaccia235: I cleared my entrance for snow and 30 mins later it had accumulated a couple of inches already
[1:17:17] IndigoCat: If the roads are bad enough that transit is stopped, it's time to stay home anyways.
[1:17:41] ghostie1995: the bigger it gets the more it looks fox-like
[1:17:48] mcxoney: whats your favorite tattoo?
[1:17:52] jakeisacat: my mom posted a notification for the county she lives in where they said snow plows will not be out on roads until it was deemed safe…which I chuckled at
[1:18:11] goplacidly56: lol
[1:18:29] enokifungus: lol I just landed at a fp and got the Still Standing in the Fire achievement
[1:18:33] cashthb: it is gross, but it's the same with hair and such
[1:18:34] Ujai321: did you eat those rabbits?
[1:18:39] Woodled: ooh thats so cool
[1:18:44] goplacidly56: love that tattoo
[1:18:45] Stealy: Let's just call it a Firrel
[1:19:04] Esoteryc: Never been able to come up with anything I'd want tatoo'd on me. Even though I'd like one. lol
[1:19:11] Ujai321: arent those rabbits your fox is eating?
[1:19:16] Ujai321: looks like rabbits to me
[1:19:23] Ujai321: i see
[1:19:45] Ujai321: spirit canibalism is probably fine, i guess?
[1:19:56] Marovia: cosmetic tattoos are not art?
[1:20:08] Stealy: Black Rye?
[1:20:11] Ujai321: i usually dont stand on bread
[1:20:14] Woodled: I've never heard of black bread before. Do you ever make sourdough?
[1:20:14] Zuldak: yeah i only know of Rye as black bread
[1:20:15] helheimr: I prefer black to the white
[1:20:21] Shrenko: hundreds of times, very common to eat with a few Norwegian dishes
[1:20:43] goplacidly56: Pumpernickle is good, spelled that wrong lol
[1:21:02] LiamA6: helloo :)
[1:21:03] Stealy: Oh the sourdough starter make fantastic pancakes too
[1:21:25] Shrenko: I love it, put a tiny layer of butter on it and eat it beside a hot meal, like soup its amazing
[1:21:38] Ujai321: that is how they get you
[1:21:40] Zuldak: sounds like propaganda for big caroway to sell more
[1:21:54] 7thSaga: LUL
[1:21:58] 7thSaga: i Love Pancakes
[1:22:22] slumberdore: hey how's the weather over there? here in portland i am completely frozen in
[1:23:08] tonibeeswax: WoW has some of the best art design in video games for sure
[1:23:10] Ujai321: oh, didnt know what caraway is. be careful how much you put in (unless you really love anis)
[1:23:43] Ujai321: i dont know if it is the same, i just know it smells and tastes similar
[1:23:45] averageteacup: Tasting History channel, last video was about Bath buns with caraway
[1:23:48] Stealy: Black bread is actually made of barley - they darkest rye is pumpernickel
[1:23:52] chefdejour82: its fennel seed
[1:24:14] wolfcloudchaser80: It's 36f/2c here and that's a heat wave compared to recent temperatures
[1:24:21] Stealy: I don't think it has barley actually - I gotta go look it up
[1:24:42] Richadin: only quest i got was complete big dig. are the others in the same place?
[1:24:49] Ujai321: do you like liquorice? as far as i can tell, it is REALLY divisive
[1:24:50] sence_00: it looks like they made this so you cant cheese it with alts - i just did WQ on an alt and got Dragon Isle Suppies not Fragments?
[1:24:52] AstralKiwi0292: caraway is not the same as anise,
[1:25:18] AstralKiwi0292: similar sortof maybe, not the same
[1:25:23] Zunkor: fentanyl seeds
[1:25:24] AstralKiwi0292: fennel also different
[1:25:40] tonibeeswax: licorice ftw, even black licorice
[1:25:54] ghostie1995: twizzlers are better than red vines sorry not sorry
[1:26:11] Stealy: yes yes - it's called barley bread but made of wheat...very confusing
[1:26:25] tonibeeswax: it seems cool!
[1:26:31] averageteacup: Go to Gilneas, it takes only 10-15 minutes :D
[1:27:08] Ujai321: my favorite spec, enhancemnet
[1:27:24] thordallim: keep in mind one of the digs in zaralak can easily bug
[1:28:17] sence_00: i just tried that, seems not
[1:28:34] FMRSilva: I don't think so, they're automatically added and not tradeable (not 100% sure tho)
[1:28:38] xzeeb1: why is it taking forever to download
[1:29:25] GamingRiggz: I'm really curious your reaction to the gilnean quest line. My response was interesting...
[1:30:11] flautoamoroso: Did you change hair color again?
[1:30:55] HazelNuttyGames: !wig
[1:30:55] Streamlabs: it's a wig
[1:31:12] Perkolate: screen capture?
[1:31:16] ghostie1995: I’m so sorry but every time I hear you say “big dig event” I always double take like ?! then I realize Lool
[1:31:22] flautoamoroso: Ahhhhh
[1:31:22] PyahPyahPyahSoda: Is the mog set just an old RAF reward?
[1:32:23] BoogiePonderosa: was that the winter veil music playing for a second?
[1:34:06] Zuldak: huh i thought the big dig site was on a rotation. Apparently it is always right there?
[1:34:28] eielwind: i think weekly @Zuldak
[1:35:23] Stealy: So I I still have to do the heritage armor quest for my worgen alt, think I should do it before I do the Gilneas storyline?
[1:35:28] GamingRiggz: @ghostie1995 glad I wasn't only one sheesshh
[1:35:43] Zuldak: @Stealy yes, you will get to know Genn's daughter more
[1:35:59] Stealy: yes fashion matters..hehe
[1:36:00] vilevillage: Thanks for all your YouTube videos! Have a wonderful day <3 :)
[1:36:10] Zuldak: Tess is Greymane's daughter and is very involved in the reclaimation. Do the worgen heritage first if you can
[1:36:18] jakeisacat: I hear you get a hearthstone if you do on worgen
[1:36:27] ghostie1995: LUL
[1:36:27] thordallim: with a worgen you get a extra item (toy) with a teleport to gilneas

[1:41:32] averageteacup: Alarm noise scares me every time, that's not how i want to wake up :D
[1:42:24] rubibeya: It would be nice to have a dark moon toy box item that works like the death knight portal. Portal to darkmoon fair then let's you return to where you were
[1:42:34] Ujai321: so it wakes you up, for you to go go turn it off?

[1:47:57] cashthb: I could pack 2 days worth of stuff in that!
[1:47:57] nyrhalahotep: why do they not want women to have pockets? Do they think that's where they'll keep their witchcraft? 🤔

[1:55:26] DarqStalker: I just don't like when ppl call appetizers, apps. Feels wrong.
[1:55:39] cashthb: I think her point was making up new stuff for no reason is the issue
[1:55:44] jakeisacat: why do they call it “cache?” you can’t even buy anything with it Kappa
[1:55:49] AmiYuy: AmiYuy subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 11 months! hazelLove hazelLove hazelLove
[1:55:50] Streamlabs: amiyuy just subscribed with Tier 1!

[1:56:35] Marovia: you know why is called Rizz?
[1:56:39] Zuldak: I draw the line at taking people saying emotes out loud like 'kappa' seriously
[1:57:01] thordallim: spam torch while running completes ez
[1:57:06] Zuldak: evolution of language is fine but saying internet speak like 'lol' is not
[1:57:07] averageteacup: i didn't notice the meter when i did this! :D
[1:57:15] cashthb: please turn up your shadows, what were those rats?!

[1:57:46] ghostie1995: I say it ironically to be funny
[1:57:48] Zuldak: Well yeah, poggerrs is all about the cardboard round things you used to flip at school in the 90s
[1:57:48] tonibeeswax: ooooh
[1:57:52] Prycey: any time someone uses twitch chat irl i immediately leave the conversation LUL
[1:57:57] jakeisacat: do pogs still exist?  that was like…30 years ago NotLikeThis
[1:57:59] ghostie1995: or like purposely cringe funny

[1:59:14] Zuldak: yes people say twitchchat emotes
[1:59:23] smalltamm: hazelLurk
[1:59:26] ivashkov92: bodacious.. yesss
[1:59:27] ajax2323: the word sadge is just so hard to not let slip out
[1:59:32] cashthb: the only slang additive that I'm willing to use is haggard!
[1:59:53] thordallim: people using copium in rl when other people who dont even watch twitch stare at them
[1:59:55] jeffdmk: pine nuts are poggers though
[2:00:23] Marovia: do you not use "Chad" in your lingo
[2:00:29] Zuldak: LOL i totally misunderstood your scenario. I thought someone checking you out and then used a pun on hazelnuttey calling you pine nuts lol
[2:00:39] shaypressplay: I pick up a lot of slang or "internet wording" but uwu will never be one of them.
[2:00:40] GreenArrowed: it's just how language evolves. a group will be cranky about it no matter what forever and onward, and language will continue to evolve.
[2:00:53] CPT_Lemons: If you use your extra action button it takes away 50-75% of their HP
[2:00:55] cashthb: english is gendered
[2:00:56] BoogiePonderosa: its fun w/ ppl pronounce them literally like "luh-mow" or "sad-guh"
[2:00:58] Blatsphemare: the extra action button does alot of dmg
[2:01:01] Phenroi: Extra action button will have Lillian attack for a large amount and cause enemies to take more dmg
[2:01:05] Marovia: i dont like how terrific is meant to be a good thing
[2:01:18] xzeeb1: again Jordan comes to minde that poor man lives in the past and wont let go
[2:01:18] jakeisacat: I mean…to be fair…internet is its own thing that no one else understands…just like deep Irish or Jamaican
[2:01:25] heydoublea: is the gilneas new mount count towards both factions?
[2:01:37] GreenArrowed: terrific, outstanding, unbelievable
[2:01:38] Prycey: uwu through me off when i first heard it, because of ff14 having a boss called uwu LUL
[2:01:40] GreenArrowed: incredble
[2:02:03] zantos2020: use your action button on those elites
[2:02:22] Kaseyfullofjoy: Lol
[2:02:28] xzeeb1: :D
[2:02:33] BoogiePonderosa: jordan petterson accent sounds like he comes from Letterkenny
[2:02:33] Marovia: why when something is a wonder is wonderful but Awe and aweful are opposites!?!?!?
[2:02:34] Sharkeys: LuL
[2:02:39] wombologee: new patch? what i miss

[2:03:11] Marovia: Touch the explosives
[2:03:15] PyahPyahPyahSoda: Yeah pretty much lol
[2:03:16] theonerune: pretty much
[2:03:17] Zuldak: Nope. Lillian takes like 80% of their hp
[2:03:17] Kaseyfullofjoy: @zuldak I used to watch how to win his money<3
[2:03:18] averageteacup: no, just too many people killing mobs and they spawn faster
[2:03:20] Zuldak: and yes this part sucks
[2:03:23] thordallim: just spawns are bad
[2:03:35] Kurama__95: Last night there were a lot of ppl aoe farming these for the quest and I just taged LUL
[2:03:49] cashthb: have you tried just polymothping them?
[2:03:51] DarqStalker: i just hung out where others were fighting and snagged the explosives while the mobs were distracted
[2:03:56] Aquanaria97: I've been bored with WoW.. is it worth doing Loremaster?
[2:04:38] l_Denix_l: what is this questchain
[2:04:39] cashthb: rats are battlepets too!
[2:04:49] wombologee: do we know like a rough estimate when the next expansion comes out, wanna wait to play till then
[2:05:04] DarqStalker: I tried a few follower dungeons and I was impressed at how well the AI party members handled the boss mechanics and damage they dealt
[2:05:32] GreenArrowed: oh yea i thought the buffing was neat
[2:05:35] l_Denix_l: mass murder my favourite activity in WoW FeelsOkayMan
[2:05:45] Prycey: @DarqStalker really? when I tried the healer kept walking into mechanics LUL
[2:05:49] cashthb: what if the bots will trash talk you for your low dps?
[2:06:03] BoogiePonderosa: haha
[2:06:09] Ju1i3: How is the Gilneas questline so far?
[2:06:10] ajax2323: i heard the new pro tip was to go get a stack of water from your follower dungeon mage before doing keys
[2:06:11] DarqStalker: @Prycey lol really? that's crazy
[2:06:15] GreenArrowed: i had an ele shammy and resto druid, the shammy lusted on 2 bosses, and the druid rezzed the tank who got lost and rebuffed
[2:06:20] nashyblaze: @cashthb it'll be like the real LFG experience
[2:06:24] blueboywiz: the bots post details damage in meters. hope your reading this blizz LUL
[2:06:55] Ju1i3: lol well
[2:07:32] DarqStalker: We're murder hobos in wow as my friend put it
[2:07:41] Zuldak: I would throw granny over the cliff for a 5 point achievment
[2:07:43] BoogiePonderosa: haha bots rage quitting and whatnot
[2:07:52] anker_jym: We're the true morally grey ones
[2:08:04] Kydar: @DarqStalker thats the long running meme on forums.
[2:08:06] Ju1i3: lol when I played Witcher 3 I ran away from wolves cause I didn't want to hurt them
[2:08:29] Marovia: yeah i dont like how are we killing the crusade for their new home
[2:08:31] Prycey: I wish they'd remove the 10-a-day limit on follower dungeons, it would make doing dungeons on alts faster then
[2:08:57] ghostie1995: and yet there’s still stigma about video games “being violent”
[2:08:57] thordallim: 10 a day / account
[2:09:01] ghostie1995: LUL
[2:09:13] LilyOfTremere: That wig's so nice! <3 Love the colour :)
[2:09:29] carbonzo_bean: ur gnome looks ballin
[2:09:41] cashthb: btw, these bots sound like a great opportunity to give na players some of that juicy eu experience. They'll stop nagging about "toxicity" in no time
[2:09:42] DarqStalker: follower dungeons are nice especially when you got that quest that needs you to go to 1 dungeon for an item. and you don't have to wait in queue
[2:10:01] carbonzo_bean: is ur shadowform glyphed or  something?  no purple at all
[2:10:04] averageteacup: NPCs standing there doing nothing while you are fighting :D
[2:10:17] l_Denix_l: Pog
[2:10:20] cashthb: it's her hair now
[2:10:38] l_Denix_l: thats a cool glyph actually
[2:10:58] averageteacup: that's hat hair, they can provide it as an option
[2:11:02] cashthb: what what if she's modelled after you? can you turn into a bigass lighspawn too?
[2:11:32] chefdejour82: Holy Light elemental
[2:11:40] DarqStalker: wish I had a fire elemental form as a shaman
[2:11:46] Zuldak: so after waiting 14 years it took like 30 troops and 15 minutes
[2:11:48] Mich_Zilla_90: YO how many mounts you at?
[2:12:09] Mich_Zilla_90: wow
[2:12:24] cashthb: @Zuldak well the forsaken took it with like 10 man soo...

[2:14:09] Marovia: when i was doing the quest i tought tess was bolvar daughter and was so confused
[2:14:16] l_Denix_l: Queen Tess saoriPadoru
[2:14:28] Tr4umhaft: "I#ve not been a good father, here's the crown, kek bye"
[2:14:31] Zuldak: Tess isnt an infected worgen. She is a normal Gilnean human
[2:14:31] Unrealsiege: who is this Tess?
[2:14:35] ghostie1995: I really liked the face animations in thus
[2:14:35] thordallim: a ruined kingdom is not that much work  ;-)
[2:14:39] cashthb: well it's only like 100m^2
[2:14:44] sence_00: LOL @Marovia she is really similar
[2:14:45] nashyblaze: I love how Genns response to being a bad father is giving her a kingdom
[2:14:49] helheimr: yeah he just dumped it on her xD kinda like the other story
[2:14:49] l_Denix_l: @Unrealsiege no one really knows saoriBongo
[2:14:49] nashyblaze: dad of the year
[2:14:54] BoogiePonderosa: or is it a squirrel?
[2:14:55] Zuldak: So the new leader of the Worgen is not a worgen
[2:14:55] thordallim: white fox
[2:15:01] LilyOfTremere: They've really upped their expression game in the in-game cutscenes :O
[2:15:08] amaya21: t's cute
[2:15:09] Mich_Zilla_90: FOX Pog
[2:15:11] Calaxandra: I read if you do this as a Worgen you also get a toy
[2:15:20] zen5unni: nice
[2:15:35] jeffdmk: did he though or is there a twist?
[2:15:47] Mich_Zilla_90: im sure she will take good care of it surely
[2:15:52] cashthb: btw they really should change tess' voice actress, she talks way too fluently for my liking
[2:15:56] ajax2323: its giving
[2:15:57] Jeansen: u can relogg and you wiull have the toy in toubox. even as horde
[2:16:01] Jeansen: just did it :)

[2:16:11] averageteacup: goes great with the bucket :D
[2:16:11] BoogiePonderosa: puffy shirt!
[2:16:11] cernthehunter: you get the toy no matter what, but can only use on your worgen
[2:16:18] Terra___l: what is the name of this set?
[2:16:26] 6sixthousand6: Its like if someone had to describe a british person to a person drawing it in another room
[2:16:30] BoogiePonderosa: it's a tuxedo tee!
[2:16:30] Pathstrider: not a fan, wanted a full length coat like genn
[2:16:33] Zuldak: oh you're doing this from the alliance side. Horde get a different ending quest. The final turn in says talk to 'Queen Calia'

[2:17:20] etherealbeluga: I have mostly worgen, lol
[2:17:25] amaya21: it's a toy that you loot from liam's grave and it brings you back to gilneas
[2:17:25] Terra___l: can i have this set as an horde or is this the same with gilneas teleport toy?
[2:17:26] ghostie1995: I’m surprised no one’s fishing near that water for those glasses
[2:17:30] Mich_Zilla_90: i leveled a worgen when i was like 12 starting out the game and was extra sad when Liam died cuz thats my name lul
[2:17:37] Zuldak: I just thihnk its weird that the new Worgen Queen isnt a worgen lol
[2:17:40] amaya21: on a worgen character only
[2:17:41] rock769: i have a worgen druid, but never get that mount :\

[2:19:06] BoogiePonderosa: the gloves are off!
[2:19:19] Mich_Zilla_90: the flower is better when on a bigger character model, would be perfect on a gnome if to the side though
[2:19:23] ajax2323: thats a bloodbourne character
[2:19:29] ghostie1995: not the top hat, the spectacles
[2:19:33] tempo119: lmfao

[2:20:56] tempo119: "i dont know if my main would be caught dead in it" meanwhile, main is dressed up as a lumberjack honey gatherer
[2:21:14] sence_00: if you are done with the intro quests the WQs are Ohnara and Zaralek right now but i think you have more to do
[2:21:28] Zuldak: 15 min for another go at the dig
[2:21:48] fisherreads: the honey dipper is one of my favorite mog items and goes so well with the bee mount

[2:24:30] For_Real_Real: so I don't end up at the alter of decay, without having checked my mail first... again..  what are the non-engineer ways to have mail box access?

[2:27:04] Prycey: i just get an alch to make me a cauldron of extracted putrescence so i don't have to keep going to brackenhide
[2:27:16] For_Real_Real: but yes - i used the follower dung to get into the hollow on normal.   pretty smooth.
