[9:15:06] mellxtv: is this your own bussiness?
[9:15:06] freedom_of_speech_usa: Won't the smoke make it hard to play darts though
[9:15:14] BoltentokE: Use it as a focal point to bring people's attention to a certain area of the arcade
[9:15:24] bzznzzman: above the entry way
[9:15:26] prestamp: will there be a place to eat inside there when opened?
[9:15:58] freedom_of_speech_usa: Someone said bar. That could be a good spot
[9:16:09] Xablanque: above bar draw people to food and beverage
[9:16:25] auberginekartoffel: put it next to the bowling allay and everytime someone hits a strike it activates
[9:17:02] The_Crafty_DM: over the bar to breathe when someone tips
[9:17:16] Shakeboxing: by the PC setup
[9:17:38] Shakeboxing: No
[9:17:45] Shakeboxing: Other PC area
[9:18:10] freedom_of_speech_usa: I think once you get more setup you'll find the best spot
[9:18:32] BuhBuhTech: Yeah dragons have to be by the PC Area for the true Dragon Slayers!
[9:18:45] freedom_of_speech_usa: I mean you could set it anywhere then do the video and move it if needed
[9:19:00] Shakeboxing: By the PC area back there on the small office wall?
[9:19:07] Xablanque: above console gaming?
[9:19:31] freedom_of_speech_usa: Do the customers want smoke. You gotta think of the majority is it going to bother them
[9:20:10] Shakeboxing: above the window by the PCs?
[9:20:56] freedom_of_speech_usa: I think that's a good idea. Maybe do a day where you just trial run it with some smoke and see how people feel about it.
[9:21:07] ironmouse34: needs to be up high
[9:21:28] freedom_of_speech_usa: That's good there

[9:38:30] Elusional: We are in the future now
[9:38:55] Elusional: Have you played any diablo 4? It is certainly getting better, It is missing core components such as trading/item value amongst players
[9:39:23] Elusional: It has PVP but it's missing something as well
[9:39:58] EddyStylez: I do battlepass then quit, can't be arsed grinding to 100, repetitive as heck
[9:40:05] Elusional: Yeah I'm not into the paid battlepa$$ either, they intentionally make items look degraded to make cosmetics more inticing
[9:40:30] Elusional: needs more than helltides/nightmare dungeons....missing something
[9:40:41] Elusional: Diablo 2 was amazing for its time
[9:40:53] Elusional: It's missing that core item hunt that diablo 2 had
[9:40:55] Elusional: runewords etc.
[9:41:02] Elusional: We about to get foggy with swifty
[9:41:23] Elusional: got that propylene glycol

[9:51:00] BoricuaSJ: or light diffuser paper
[9:51:04] Elusional: I think it detects carbon monoxide/fire byproducts, propylene glycol may not react the same ;) I could be wrong LMFAO
[9:51:20] OzChopper: you'd want to hope that the smoke doesn't set off a fire alarm
[9:51:22] BoltentokE: Need some ambient lighting
