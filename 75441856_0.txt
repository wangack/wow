[1:06:40] TrisClaxton: If PvP is based on item level, how would it balance if someone that doesn't raid have a chance against someone in full mythic gear? Also, since the only weapon in Legion is going to be the legendary, how will someone that hasn't upgraded theirs fully have a chance against someone that has? (IE: Someone that has a lot of 'alts' and likes to play them all.)
