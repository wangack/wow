[1:33:12] EASEPEASE: Killswitch Pog
[1:33:15] duncstv: I Think MOP is going to be a huge spike in players
[1:33:17] Mythirun: Blizzard might add retail hc soon
[1:33:23] Curtsy: @Savix the "hard" gamma dungeons in wotlk are easier than regular heroics tbh because of the buffs it gives
[1:33:36] Jaithys5150: im fasting this week thanks for the good entertainment to take my mind off the hunger
[1:33:38] temp3st98: i member watchin your videos from wod Stronge @Savix
[1:33:39] kekzo: i had more fun in tbc Sadge
[1:33:42] AdamShwaginz: I have nobody to play wow with Sadge
[1:33:49] worldpeace_nomshayin: @Savix did you ever see this video? i just watched it and thought it was really well put for alot of aspects of the game. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BKP1I7IocYU
[1:33:53] Hoshma46: Headbang
[1:33:56] its_me_: retail has too many choices
[1:33:56] ALcovEX: nah not anymore
[1:34:00] simply_synck: hiii GlueTime BOOM
[1:34:02] Mythirun: fuh
[1:34:04] NutterCircus: Retail? Might as well be playing raid shadow legends.
[1:34:04] mediana91: I'd do only transmog farming from old raids and dungeons
[1:34:07] LyteGod: Classic wow chill until you pull early in Savix raid, then u fear for your life LULW
[1:34:13] wakeandbacon95: i respect it
[1:34:13] YzieGG: I dont like retail combat
[1:34:16] succaw: not always tho
[1:34:19] Tangents92: Retail is Que simulator KEKW
[1:34:21] AdamShwaginz: I only play retail when there's timewalking KEKW
[1:34:22] succaw: it can be overwheling for new players
[1:34:23] dermuiker: people lookin down on you because you play the game differently than they do
[1:34:31] aceassination: I'd rather have fewer amazing choices than a lot of shitty choices
[1:34:36] Mythirun: fuh i always pull early in retail
[1:34:38] bliz0th: retail combat is pretty good savixNodders
[1:34:39] Hoshma46: this is a really cool emote Gartic Ok
[1:34:45] EASEPEASE: retail is "play how you want" retail is so much faster paced than classic.
[1:34:46] iamdemonslayer: LOCKEDIN
[1:34:46] StealthImage: retail combat is so much better that I can agree on it IS confusing for NEW people
[1:34:47] hornymclovin: i hate how much damage you do in retail its like 22099482 and its like 0.1% in pvp
[1:34:50] SJ1093: wrrr
[1:34:55] EASEPEASE: classic is for dad gamers
[1:34:56] Jaeberwok: PvP is better in retail, WPvE is better in classic.
[1:34:57] blazzedzz: To many cds and procs for my boomer brain
[1:34:59] iamdemonslayer: wrrr
[1:35:00] JoeBangles_: Aware ]
[1:35:01] nfqelite: IMO retail has a higher skill cap. so its harder for "normies" to stay relevent and do high end game content
[1:35:02] SwazilandPrince: Honestly retail PvE is poggers, but all the classes are too similar in PvP now, I like the rock. paper scissors aspect of classic
[1:35:06] Mythirun: comixs describe it so good
[1:35:07] Naboo69: savixOld queue the battle ground blitz it scales your gear
[1:35:07] amoonguss_3000: Sure
[1:35:07] Mythirun: om
[1:35:07] SigmaTapion: I'm leveling a Rogue now on retail. I'm level 59

[1:35:14] ALcovEX: just casually tho GIGASOY
[1:35:15] fuzzywuzzyqt: @Savix you could have asked me om
[1:35:15] bulljr3: I think retail does good at catching you back up
[1:35:21] Curtsy: @nfqelite retail being harder isn't an opinion, it's objective fast
[1:35:24] iamdemonslayer: @LyteGod real om
[1:35:25] oqupaa: @Savix you go on AH, bey intro pvp gear and sighn up as usually
[1:35:30] Windnecro: you can transfer honor between characters now in retail, so you can gear anything pretty easy for current pvp season
[1:35:35] Mythirun: ye
[1:35:37] temp3st98: id rather have alot of choices like fun stuff instead of only grinding for gear and sweat like ffxiv and lost ark had (minus lost ark honing) KEKW @Savix
[1:35:43] iamdemonslayer: i heard that too but I don't play retail savixHmm
[1:35:44] amoonguss_3000: raid is only good for trinkets/quickly gear up alts
[1:35:51] JoeBangles_: I like to open wow stare at character select for 2 hour and then close game
[1:35:52] kekzo: whats the point in raiding then OMEGALUL
[1:35:54] amoonguss_3000: honor carries over season too
[1:35:54] Curtsy: you can xfer honor in wotlk dude
[1:35:55] mlbAct: @savix i remember watching Soda back in the cata days
[1:35:57] its_me_: group finder has 0 low keys so new players get stuck
[1:35:59] temp3st98: yes
[1:36:00] fuzzywuzzyqt: Yes you can
[1:36:00] Pepsuliini: wtf
[1:36:02] wakeandbacon95: yo savix cool hair style, kind of reminds me of geto from jujutsu kaisen, been watching that show lately :D
[1:36:03] AdamShwaginz: huh??
[1:36:10] Kerack321: ive geared so many characters through my main now xD
[1:36:10] temp3st98: 2500 for 1500 honor @Savix
[1:36:11] asnowgoose: let's face it retail is just a better game, classic is way to random and unbalanced (but I do enjoy SoD, not saying it's bad)
[1:36:12] Mythirun: and conquest?
[1:36:13] oqupaa: @Savix You can gain Bind to Account conquest points aswell
[1:36:23] oqupaa: @Savix And i belive you can transfer them aswell
[1:36:31] wreckstormx: and after getting all the things we found out we actually dont want it LUL
[1:36:37] kraztez: +
[1:36:42] EASEPEASE: bg blitz
[1:36:45] EASEPEASE: solo queue rbg
[1:36:53] Naboo69: savixOld it is in the game already but not rated yet
[1:36:54] temp3st98: soloq bgs peepoGiggles
[1:37:09] oqupaa: They are already testing the 'ranked' bgs as battleground brawls. THey are great - they are also a little shorter :)
[1:37:09] AdamShwaginz: YEP
[1:37:11] FuegoleonW: hiii
[1:37:15] justeaton: the graphics :)
[1:37:25] AdamShwaginz: <3
[1:37:27] kekzo: theres a lot to do but its not fun OMEGALUL
[1:37:27] Jaithys5150: graphic is pog

[1:37:30] LyteGod: @FuegoleonW hiii
[1:37:33] DashKT: Just hte one graphic
[1:37:35] AdamShwaginz: for real dude
[1:37:36] bliz0th: @FuegoleonW hello hiii hello
[1:37:43] Surruptitious: when I first started playing the game 15 years ago, I had a lot of friends that I played for years with, the lack of real life friends playing now is honestly the biggest reason I don't play retail
[1:37:46] Naboo69: savixOld wake of ashes animation Kreygasm
[1:37:47] FeralTami: @FuegoleonW hiii
[1:38:01] Curtsy: Current DH is so fun, actually have buttons to press compared to what it's been in the past
[1:38:06] Laawkey: @Comixs thats just personal if the only things u can enjoy in the game are raid or mythics then yes the game sucks but theres so much more than just that
[1:38:09] Pordragon: nah
[1:38:11] thefoxborough: People kick you if you talk in LFG KEKW
[1:38:11] Laawkey: its not  just get out there
[1:38:12] Laawkey: om
[1:38:12] temp3st98: i wish we could go back to how simple it was instead of every single core gameplay is only catering for 1%
[1:38:12] justeaton: PepeLaugh
[1:38:14] wreckstormx: no u cant find friends
[1:38:14] amoonguss_3000: you just join a guild ez
[1:38:15] Harthad: in retail ? yes
[1:38:15] Houkiedoukie: people are so antisocial in retail compared to classic
[1:38:16] Pordragon: people can join guild ez
[1:38:18] T3X_87: No, not at all
[1:38:18] AdamShwaginz: I haven't organically made a wow friend since I was 10 lol
[1:38:19] reteeh: friends in game >? wtf a affix
[1:38:21] Laawkey: its not hard at all
[1:38:26] bulljr3: I like how if you hit a mob at all in retail, you get credit, fighting for mobs in classic gets frustrating sometime.
[1:38:27] Laawkey: just join social guild and they welcome you
[1:38:31] Mythirun: just hang out with guildes in m+
[1:38:31] Alluzio: wait people can't make friends in a game?
[1:38:32] Curtsy: I do M+ with my GF and tbh I don't want to be friends with any of the people we pug with KEKW
[1:38:42] Windnecro: finding friends in the game isnt too hard you just have to actually put yourself out there and talk to people, made a bunch of friends doing random arenas or m+s
[1:38:42] mlbAct: @savix you? having friends,
[1:38:52] Laawkey: theres litteraly guild built to find friends om
[1:38:55] mordiell: yea the gear in retail is looking amazing https://wow.zamimg.com/uploads/screenshots/normal/1132366.jpg
[1:38:56] mlbAct: @savix you? having friends? please stop lying to us co0perBL
[1:39:00] StobGG: i found a guild in Classic TBC that is really good and going into cata with them so thats what has kept me on Classic
[1:39:02] Kleik__: @Laawkey depend, its rng i tried few of this guild and it was all of closed friend groups so guilds are not really that good of place to look at imo, or maybe i was unlucky muh
[1:39:11] Windnecro: also a bunch of discords to find people to play with etc
[1:39:13] Tropicocity: KKona GuitarTime
[1:39:22] iamdemonslayer: people in skirmishes were so much worse than rated tho LULW a 2700 rated guy added me cuz we were winning skirmishes and I went like 4-10 with him cuz I suck om
[1:39:23] Tangents92: Prove it
