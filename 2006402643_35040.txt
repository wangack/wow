Just finished my honour run in  bg3 and got the golden dice, it was fucking amazing. Changes to haste mechanics (most sources of haste not giving extra attacks, only action surge), legendary actions making every boss encounter unique and challenging, drs abusers being in shambles (looking at u phalar aluve enjoyers) and all the other changes make the game feel exactly as it was meant to be played. Can't wait for u to experience all of it yourself. Cheers! P.s. deezNutzzz
