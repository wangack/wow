[2:27:43] wahlj0920: I think the Variety show works, but get rid of the scavenger hunt, and put something else in it's place
[2:27:59] nimuae8: Capture the fawn in a photo?
[2:28:05] SerlKin: I like the scavenger hunt :3
[2:28:09] Chaoticsaur: @wahlj0920 agreed, scavenger hunt is a big miss for me
[2:28:16] Raz_Adventures: @wahlj0920 agree, leveling was so much more interesting
[2:28:18] rpstoval: It is sort of strange that JokerD is not included in this game
[2:28:36] hesher2397: shills

[2:28:42] moderatygos: appreciate the feedback
[2:28:50] phoenixsorrow: i love the scavenger hunt idea. taken part and created 1 for my guild over the years
[2:28:52] Misscheetah_mvp: @Chaoticsaur I used to design these scavenger hunts for my guild and loved them. The format here on Twitch is not really as engaging given the short time span. Just chaotic in presentation.
[2:29:03] HappyParoxysm: Faun got enraged! o:

[2:31:25] Chaoticsaur: @misscheetah_mvp yeah they are super fun to do, hard to present it as a viewing experience though.
[2:31:27] rpstoval: @rpstoval I think he has several retail lvl chars, but indeed does not actually play them

[2:35:07] rtsplanner: two little ones must have great bedtime storys
[2:35:11] Chaoticsaur: @sebitronco you can get shadowlands for free if you are returning, you still have to pay the sub though
[2:35:11] swiftonzwift: Maybe an episode where they’re all rogues and have to pickpocket certain city characters 🥷🏿

[2:58:13] kittiezZ_: tbh fly to the top of that sword and fall off it takes a long time XD
[2:58:14] MysticRaven_: High Mountain - Tall mountain - has a section full of bears - in Azeroth
[2:58:18] shpunkgaming: No 🤣🤣 it’s legit the one from legion
[2:58:21] xCornishPastyx: this is a trick question because none of you know what a continent is!
[2:58:23] Xarisher: @ThrashpandaTTV A respecting, joyous response indeed. I'm flabbergasted at such a reply.
[2:58:25] Tadilynn: its in highmountain so its the broken isles

[3:00:02] kittiezZ_: love darkmoon faire <3
[3:00:02] Spoons42: If shadowlands areas are considered "Azeroth" then Oribos is highest.  Otherwise IMO it's the sword in Kalimdor - if that's not a "peak" then Pandaria probably the answer
[3:00:06] Treebonker: Pandaria
