[2:40:06] Blitzylive: No. 9.2 does not bring cross faction. That's 9.2.5
[2:40:10] EvoCyberNation: I think it was a lost move Teagens. They're suffering from player loss.
[2:40:17] EvoCyberNation: last* not lost
[2:40:31] lilgunnavert: who is he talking too?
[2:40:40] Thunderbrew: Blizzard doesn't have the juice they used to have.
