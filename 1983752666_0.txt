[3:02:49] Oarens: does ElusiveOne_ have bongo envy? danBongos
[3:02:56] UndefinedVibe: classic is more of a slow simmer
[3:02:59] BananaStreaker: What class are you rolling in Season of Discovery next week Dan?
[3:03:00] Xaedrik32: Retail just feels rushed and fast paced
[3:03:03] jediknight223: Alot of the RPG is gone
[3:03:04] Insanefrenzy: a lot of mmos are about the end game now instead of the journey
[3:03:05] Zunahme: Like PoE
[3:03:14] Corvin_Tom: even for me it is more appealing then retail and i never played classic so no nostalgia factor
[3:03:18] bgriff87: Retail is just rush to raiding and mythic+ progression
[3:03:20] PerseusOlcinius: @dansgaming what if retail hardcore was a thing?
[3:03:20] Mad_Klauss: yea and that's cool cuz its like a journey
[3:03:21] DirteeX: yeah agreed, rolled a retail monk and it felt like if I slowed down the game was mad lol
[3:03:25] bgriff87: I guess PVP too
[3:03:27] Oarens: I love the slow grind in classic, it's so relaxing danNice

[3:05:20] StealthReborn: booty bay danBlush
[3:05:21] SoulSurvivors: In my opinion classic just feels like you are part of the world with all small quests and tiny details of the world. In retail it's blown out of proportions with multiple worlds and threats and whatnot, it just feels less real and atmospher'ish
