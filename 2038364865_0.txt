[0:29:26] gorfang: @ryan___mcg press ctrl v in game
[0:29:31] magickdoge: @cr4nkc0r3 Yeah but the ashenvale event isn't pvp or an event. You run around and lag out and 50% of the time you win. It's trash, low effort, filler.

[0:30:34] cosmicoriginz: yes it ignores armor
[0:30:36] TrillMurr: @Zenlyn yes it does
[0:30:42] Zenlyn: dayuuum
