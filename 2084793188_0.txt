[1:06:09] heymomimonttv: @zerx_gg the mog is probably fine you just dont know how to pick a good location. you took it in one of the darkest rooms with a background that is a similar color to your mog

[2:30:46] vbbkelskerdig: do you think it stunts your growth as a player to play multiple classes when first getting into wow pvp?
[2:31:00] mzaamentor: when's his death knight arc beginining though?
[2:31:17] seyvyur: it stunts your rating, but you'll learn a lot about classes that will help you in the long run
[2:31:19] bigpumperrz: its doable i think
[2:31:22] fridxa: @vbbkelskerdig you need to learn on basic level all classes anyways if you want to play pvp

[2:44:51] Ezionn: @JonnyJoystick Ven using the Blizzard private plane.
[2:44:53] Sosatko: I played mage from cata till DF

[2:46:11] Feanorian: can I get your thoughts on the state of mage?
[2:46:21] FateIRL: so just be a top 4 streamer in a category to get big. rich get richer

[2:46:54] Schwenkyytv: only reason why i got first class was i got upgraded cause of military but that was once, it was super comfy
[2:46:57] tqsauce21: first class is a rip off, there's plenty of things you can pay more for and get good value, first class airfare is not
[2:47:00] willie_stroker_99: hahahahah
[2:47:00] JonnyJoystick: If you were flying with your wife and they offered first class to only one of you, would you take it or give it to your wife?
[2:47:15] Zenfuzz: i wanna see us get the triple barrier again
[2:47:28] checkemcharles: i fly pesiante class only

[2:48:24] hoopscotch: WOOOO
[2:48:31] JonnyJoystick: @qEExzz Well I would take it and my gf would understand because im tall

[2:50:29] 2pikula: some beef skewers babyyy
[2:50:33] NovaSun84: i've seen people eating sandwiches that are in tupperware
[2:50:34] Zenfuzz: You think triple barrier would help fire mages or all mages for that matter with survivability and not having to waste many globals on surviving?
[2:50:43] tarth_100: You can bring on plane, but might not make it through customs when u land
[2:50:44] jojinzini: idk if you get through tsa with certain food and bevs
[2:50:53] hoopscotch: processed foods should be good
[2:50:57] hoopscotch: meat can be iffy

[2:53:00] NovaSun84: there are way worse places in the world to take a shit than in an airplane.
[2:53:10] JonnyJoystick: US needs to catch on to the Bidets, they need to be everywhere
[2:53:20] checkemcharles: I was thinking the reasons europeand dont shower as much as north americans is because they all use bidets

[3:11:22] nikthevoker: @heymomimonttv exactly, but cheapest option atm
[3:11:33] mzaamentor: fury of the eagle is a scuffed FoF and it's clunky
[3:11:35] skez_live: its cool in a hipster way
[3:11:39] mzaamentor: absolutely hate the new sv

[4:26:29] Spaceberry_McDuck: @Axtin happened to me a few weeks ago. couldnt figure out why my dispel macro had stopped working on my shaman
[4:26:41] 5tarchild: could it be because you changed ur talents?
[4:27:18] ALLtheEXP: pwaff checked his deathlog and he was hit by a 450k arcane barrage
[4:27:21] scubaclay: physical shield?
[4:27:23] slyphex: ams?
[4:27:23] What_ln_Tarnation: DS shield?
[4:27:27] ALLtheEXP: it's likely his boneshield?
[4:27:33] ArdellanDH: Pi ?
[4:27:44] ArdellanDH: Combined with mage shield
[4:27:55] ALLtheEXP: mage coulda hit his buttons too
[4:28:02] nomcarver00: blood dk get a physical absorb from death striking.
[4:28:04] heymomimonttv: i think its boneshield or something. blood dk has a thing where they keep gaining shield as their health is dropping and they could have a 50% shield and still die. not sure tho tbh
[4:28:08] What_ln_Tarnation: imagine with -10% stam
[4:28:22] Goahti: Think it's blood shield
[4:28:28] storm_chaser_ron: 2 of the nvellen games you had bind issues
[4:28:33] ALLtheEXP: tbf you were having bind issues
[4:28:50] itz_killjoy: blood is best dk spec LUL
[4:30:07] chaps_86: most lobbies for me =P

[4:30:27] NozakGaming: that right there is why playing a healer in shuffle is so frustrating lol
[4:30:49] hunchurio: its not fun at al
[4:30:50] darksigns94: same here i though but i i tried it and it feels so good
[4:30:53] R1_Prototype: I wanna know why the macros break randomly mid match. or mid target dummy. like how actually?
[4:31:06] Liinkk89: that slipknot song <3

[4:31:36] dickman911: @nikthevoker lol then what
[4:32:04] chaps_86: What do you think about survival so far?
[4:32:05] nuckAU: Morning mr Ruki :)
[4:32:38] Shirey12: outdated content that you know what bis is
[4:32:38] Sosatko: its very boring rn this phase died quick
[4:32:41] Sosatko: after the gdkp ban
[4:32:52] Sosatko: Not even close
[4:32:58] Nadasky: Wait what gdkp ban? blindcLooker
[4:32:59] Xelim27: verymuch
[4:32:59] nikthevoker: i just raid log, always full bis -2 and  flip AH for gold
[4:33:01] nuckAU: I like it
[4:33:03] Shirey12: GDKPS create gold buying
[4:33:09] nikthevoker: already^
[4:33:09] Moobot: YouTube channel: youtube.com/venruki * Subscribe for new content!
[4:33:10] Locturnal_TV: id only play sod if i could gdkp, pugs are a complete waste
[4:33:11] nuckAU: its been a good change on my realm
[4:33:12] Sosatko: @Shirey12 false bots create gold
[4:33:22] Shirey12: @Sosatko my reason.
[4:33:25] NozakGaming: it was successful in making a large group of the player base not play lol
[4:33:32] Tyferious: I never liked GDKP
[4:33:36] cadillacseville: i knew ven was gonna start loving survival
[4:33:36] Locturnal_TV: yea either real group or gdkp
[4:33:41] ALLtheEXP: this song SLAPS all these years later
[4:33:42] Tyferious: Come buy your loot
[4:33:42] nuckAU: sod is easy, never not cleared in a pug so far
[4:33:50] R1_Prototype: it was fun for nostalgia. classic. got me back into the game. but I don’t see much value playing SoD
[4:33:54] Locturnal_TV: but trying to form pugs sounds like misery
[4:33:54] chaps_86: The fact that flightstones arent account bound blows my mind
[4:33:59] ATHLTE: ^
[4:33:59] nikthevoker: does no toons have extra conquest?
[4:34:00] ALLtheEXP: nah, you play every day, you'll be able to send boxes
[4:34:03] Deeblain: people are so dumb. its not gold buying or gdkp that is the problem. its the fucking bots. gold comes literally out of thin air in this game. more players = more gold. they dont sleep they dont eat they just farm. BOTS are the problem.
[4:34:05] R1_Prototype: conquest got uncapped this week tho
[4:34:08] xmostpalone: at least its not shadowlands when u had to hit 1800 in 1600 poop honor gear and upgrade it 8 times...
[4:34:09] kusoneko: 3's games are faster (at low rating) and give more conq
[4:34:13] itz_killjoy: should they just remove gear if no one wants to wait?
[4:34:17] SteLawBro: I logged on an alt to catch up and realized the hours and golf to catch up and was like yea, no thanks.
[4:34:22] Sosatko: @Deeblain thank you this is the truth
[4:34:24] fridxa: @R1_Prototype it wasnt this week, it was like 2-3 weeks ago LUL
[4:34:24] SteLawBro: gold
[4:34:26] Sosatko: ppl that think gdkps create gold are morons
[4:34:30] nuckAU: @Deeblain why do you think the bots are there? To feed gold buyers who spend it in gdkps...
[4:34:31] Shirey12: Gold runs classic wow because there is 0 Gold sinks.
[4:34:35] invitca1776: I think gdkp kill the value of raiding though
[4:34:36] williwhite94: there can be more then 1 problem
[4:34:41] NozakGaming: my group of 5 friends didnt play this phase because of GDKP ban. we pugged until we got gear and then hosted GDKPs and were swimming in gold. none of us purchased gold and it took away are way of farming gold. lol
[4:34:41] kusoneko: Bots have been a thing for like 15 years, its never going away
[4:34:48] cadillacseville: do the solo q quest, trophy quest, any other fast quests, craft two pieces, youll be full honor/conq fast
[4:34:49] zachgamegodx: gold runs?
[4:34:54] schdenfreude: If there are no gdkp there much less reason to buy gold tho
[4:34:55] Slayer_Eagleone: that seems like a hot take venruki if i ever heard one
[4:34:58] ALLtheEXP: bottlecaps
[4:34:58] zachgamegodx: pay ppl with it
[4:35:03] mzaamentor: if they had housing
[4:35:04] Shirey12: They need WoW Token in Classic.
[4:35:04] Secretwombatbro: bring back retired mogs
[4:35:05] What_ln_Tarnation: they have some mogs you can buy for millions
[4:35:07] Secretwombatbro: for lots of gold
[4:35:07] cadillacseville: within an hour you can get full honor and 4-5 epics
[4:35:08] mzaamentor: furnitures and shit
[4:35:10] Slayer_Eagleone: buy boosts?
[4:35:25] mzaamentor: housing could be an insanely big gold sink
[4:35:32] Secretwombatbro: or put more stuff in the shop to convert gold to shop credit for
[4:35:37] mzaamentor: and they'd print money with ppl buying tokens lmao
[4:35:38] Secretwombatbro: but like interesting things
[4:35:50] Nadasky: Housing? Anyone here who would buy a house ingame? LUL
[4:35:56] mzaamentor: yes
[4:36:02] mzaamentor: I 100% would
[4:36:04] ALLtheEXP: At this point in the games life, i'm not sure how successful player housing would be
[4:36:08] cadillacseville: star wars galaxies housing was perfect
[4:36:15] ALLtheEXP: Blizz has not wanted to do player housing for so long
[4:36:17] Secretwombatbro: i mean they could just do housing blocks kinda like new world did
[4:36:25] mzaamentor: yeah
[4:36:38] bingles3181: you used spearhead not coordinated assault
[4:36:38] R1_Prototype: @deeblain what? bots fund the gold market for GDKP. with GDKP gone bots can’t sell to anyone. because people don’t need it. for GDKP.
[4:36:42] Secretwombatbro: and plop them straight into the cities
[4:36:51] grkznsk: 123
[4:37:06] mzaamentor: enjoyable while I work
[4:37:13] mzaamentor: thanks for the games ruki
[4:37:15] Deeblain: get rid of the bots. the gold problem fixes itself. the only answer is to get rid of bots.
[4:37:19] suspicious94: hotfixes are coming this week by blue post says several dragonflight season three dungeon issues will be addressed  =(
[4:37:27] Jarettol: I enjoy watching you play wow while i play wow, lol

[4:38:02] Sosatko: @nuckAU sure ban bots ban gold buyers boom problem solved
[4:38:21] nuckAU: @Sosatko they will never do that, its loss of subs.
[4:38:35] Sosatko: @nuckAU exactly which is why games dead 2 weeks into p2 lol
[4:38:49] nuckAU: its why banning gdkps is working...
[4:39:06] Sosatko: kek
[4:39:15] nuckAU: not 100%, but its made a massive difference on my realm
[4:39:24] nuckAU: rogue/mage bots are almost gone entirely
[4:39:30] Sosatko: sure they are
[4:39:34] nuckAU: yup
[4:39:45] suspicious94: I think blizzard had honestly just dipped their toes in to many wow eras. either focus on the current game or end at the re released of Cata
[4:39:47] nuckAU: No one to sell the gold to now
[4:39:53] R1_Prototype: really tho. ultimately they don’t wanna ban gold buyers. like why would they want to ban people that like the game so much they’d spend MORE money to play it. *cough cough* wow token *cough* so they fixed the issue. now stop breaking tos.
[4:39:59] nvees: short question: is devotion aura the right one to choose? i always thought 5% dmg and healing is better
[4:40:07] Shirey12: Retail > SoD, you guys came here to watch Venruki play a game he enjoys. Stop with this sod crap
[4:40:30] nameyourform: so are we gonna go on strike for no changes again today or what?
[4:40:43] Nadasky: Yoooo "Your soul is mine" is not a paladin quote

[4:41:00] williwhite94: @venruki have you ever thought about voice acting man ?
[4:41:05] ALLtheEXP: it does if you're playing it properly
[4:41:13] R1_Prototype: “why would I waste my time playing retail when I could actually DELETE my time in playing SoD” - every SoD Player.
[4:41:15] zachgamegodx: dont
[4:41:18] williwhite94: i think your good at it and have good range
[4:41:21] zachgamegodx: you'd talk about joe and a toe
[4:41:38] mzaamentor: lol what
[4:41:49] chaps_86: Very few abilities, but you need lots of macros...Freedom party1/2, sanc party 1/2, bop, sac, etc
[4:41:53] Shirey12: @R1_Prototype Truest of true.

[5:09:46] account4turbonoadz: is it just a full script for an opener on rogue lol?
[5:09:48] shivwren: If you think the pet battle people are working on PVP you are a little confused

[5:26:48] gorefangx: ok ty @dailyshuffle
[5:27:27] nightmxz: still 43% vers, not bad
[5:27:36] chaps_86: Shadowpriest is good, but man is it very try-hard to get decent rating
[5:27:51] nightmxz: It was funny in that game unless you  had serenity popped and the rogue had me stunned I felt immortal
[5:27:52] repsac1442: happy Friday ven hope you’re doing great !
[5:28:16] nasko10: guys is there any way to farm conquest fast ?

[5:32:41] empewress: LOL

[5:38:46] Bigvuqoffdam: have you seen the guys who climb skyscrapers
[5:38:46] itz_killjoy: waiting for a reptilian to grab his ass
[5:38:48] ginyu_music: is there an ending??
[5:38:49] famous1939: he doesnt make it out btw. family released it later
[5:38:56] galdinator: exploring under the map Pog
[5:39:00] R1_Prototype: spelunking is actually one of the most dangerous hobbies you can have. Per Capita more deaths than sky divers, base jumpers, and scuba divers
[5:39:02] nikthevoker: thats just scary
[5:39:02] chaps_86: @famous1939 lol you're trolling
[5:39:04] olivio_aa: @famous1939 Nah he is good

[5:39:14] CrazyJoeDavola57: he uploaded then died
[5:39:14] famous1939: that's the trail that the internet took me on with it
[5:39:16] R1_Prototype: as I was saying.....
[5:39:21] mzaamentor: they only found a pile of bones mauled
[5:39:26] FateIRL: did you see the videos of the  thai soccer team stuck in the cave, nightmare fuel

[5:40:05] Locturnal_TV: they had to break that guys legs to try and get him out. didnt work
[5:40:18] malvarcla: oh yeah that story is so tragic
[5:40:20] R1_Prototype: cave divers have teams, and coms, and leads. spelunkers often aren't prepared for situations they find themselves in.
[5:40:33] nikthevoker: he deserves to be left
[5:40:37] malvarcla: they had to close the cave with him in it @venruki
[5:40:39] five_moke: omg no I told u not to look at it!
[5:40:41] cyborg1141: Oh God I've seen that didn't they seal him informer as a memorial?

[5:40:43] dailyshuffle: i saw this some days on reddit
[5:40:47] stopeating: imagine having to be the person to go and try to save them
[5:40:51] heymomimonttv: i'll do alot of shit in nature and explore but tight caves and spelunking are a big hell no
[5:40:58] stoutside: didnt they just leave him there sealed in concrete
[5:40:59] itz_killjoy: that kid was smiling, he was so happy
[5:41:04] Magottx: Ven prefers going on top of the mountain not under
[5:41:09] onedayoumay985: @venruki if we get changes at what time usually?
[5:41:11] chaps_86: the "free-solo" climbing is nuts to me
[5:41:14] chimerablaque: I'll experience life behind a screen instead thanks
[5:41:14] nikthevoker: fuck it leave em
[5:41:32] ralotheret: they left him there you can still see the boots I think
[5:41:45] Ronn_Deezy: good thing i cant read EZ
