[1:15:43] bambucha34: I would still says arcane has bit easier rotation but both are pretty easy
[1:15:52] Valestrus: will we be able to farm honor in earlier phases to get to max rank at later phases? or are we time gated?

[3:55:46] blackarkiitek: @21up21 He probably made 2500g farming, i made 1000g first week of SOD because i was the only one farming grave moss, was getting 40/50g hour
[3:55:49] Oopogo1: the problem with classic is 50% of the content of the entire game is gold farming, so once you have a lot of gold there's nothing to do
[3:55:50] PhilFancypants: the way the game was meant to be played ok
[3:55:57] Lingongrova: Levelled up 8 alch/tailors for cata so I don't have to gdkp for money :)

[3:57:06] LightBladeStream: hard cock to swallow

[4:00:54] HuffD3: all the people complaining about the ban are just mad they can get funneled RMT gold
[4:01:02] HuffD3: can't*
[4:01:03] bigchibbin: at least read the joke @JokerdTV
[4:01:06] Bothurin: why are you skinning
[4:01:09] shiavux: someone with 7 alts never outside. at least irl
[4:01:13] kharma99: @bigchibbin KEKInsane

[4:01:23] Zyrax11: @bigchibbin joker and reading chat KEKG good luck
[4:01:24] Derken11: not true :)
[4:01:28] nadixlol: ye i was raiding 3 chars in wrath, made around 100k gold a week, and got every item i wanted on my main. dident need to buy any gold
[4:01:37] Oopogo1: truth is the people who don't like gold farming or suck at farming gold will be in the same situation regardless of GDKP ban
[4:01:45] bumlaska: Kappa
[4:01:49] Saiauriel: @bigchibbin he is drunk https://clips.twitch.tv/AnnoyingImpossibleGorillaKAPOW-pUKfAFdHYaT4rd65
[4:01:49] fakedeath28: same old stories ?
[4:01:51] quim24: P2w
[4:01:54] earlyseasoneric: @JokerdTV i made most of my gold from selling boes on the AH most likely to gold buyers from the prices they were sellng at so if i continue doin that wont have to farm gold at all
[4:01:59] Mico027: still traded gold for raid loot
[4:02:03] Derken11: banned kek
[4:02:14] AeonClash: Are GDKPs not allowed already or does that start in P2?!?!?!?!
[4:02:14] 1Head_KFC_MANAGER: have 1042 gold on my mage now from farming hillsbrad mine perma, is enough for p2 start?
[4:02:16] kharma99: Someone pushed YAPMODE and now its stuck on. PopNemo
[4:02:20] Oopogo1: @earlyseasoneric it's funny because a lot of these ppl have no concept of how a lot of us old school mmorpg players play
[4:02:25] Freddy_Krueger: dude is this your thesis defense presentation? yap PogO enough already
[4:02:31] Nice_n_Dicey: i am an altoholic and proud
[4:02:32] Oopogo1: @earlyseasoneric gold making is the majority of content in the game for us
[4:02:33] bumlaska: yapgod
[4:02:40] chevyb: @Oopogo1 i dont even care about gold buying and gdkps i like them but saying that its not a loot system that incentivise gold buying and will inflate everyones pocket that joins them is just wrong
[4:02:41] Kuda1000: are you upset you spent the time playing palworld and took time away from wow?
[4:02:42] SluggEU: VeryPog
[4:02:51] saund: can you make a guild Altoholics Anonymous
[4:02:53] shiavux: issa different story for you tho. you making irl bucks playin the game cuh
[4:02:55] Noobish101: everyone was an altoholic in sod
[4:03:03] quim24: Imagine blizzard band the gold trade in the raid that will be awesome
[4:03:04] burdon21: @1head_kfc_manager lol yes your good
[4:03:23] slavmachine69: what is addon called for gold count?
[4:03:24] Charlemagne_66: its also because there is nothing to do really
[4:03:24] rhaziaa: @JokerdTV Does murdering all of these poor innocent animals make you feel strong?
[4:03:28] earlyseasoneric: @Oopogo1 it isnt for me pvp is but ive always made tons of gold from the ah passively honestly probly thanks to gold buyers because the prices dont make sense
[4:03:30] Oopogo1: @chevyb i havent even done a gdkp in SoD and still have 2500g
[4:03:31] Nihongophile: I would love to go to GDKPs but because of the RMT and Gbuying I dont do it. I like the idea but at the end of the day I think the cons are greater than the rewards
[4:03:38] chevyb: @Oopogo1  even if youre in a raid where no one did buy gold there is a chance a few guys where in a raid last id with people that bought gold and they did profit from that
[4:03:43] Bothurin: Why are you skinning?
[4:03:51] Noobish101: would have been really boring too
[4:03:57] Charlemagne_66: if u dont care about farming gold or doing pvp of course you will level alts
[4:04:02] Oopogo1: @earlyseasoneric the problem is people just assume everything is dirty because they are broke in game and envy ppl with gold
[4:04:04] earlyseasoneric: @chevyb or they profited from the gold buyers using the ah which is more likely
[4:04:13] 21up21: kill those antelope!!
[4:04:19] Saresante: There's no 60 for sod, everyone's gonna be playing cata by that point anyway KEKW
[4:04:20] OneBillionDollarsyolo: farming grey mobs ICANT

[4:04:23] dfuzz_y: what you doing? @jokerdtv
[4:04:26] Oopogo1: @earlyseasoneric when it simply isn't true...many of us are just veteran players who know how to make gold legitimately
[4:04:37] bumlaska: NOWAY
[4:04:46] OneBillionDollarsyolo: cata ICANT

[4:05:31] Sypro90: YEP
[4:05:32] Noobish101: youll play cata on 1 char, get it geared in 1 month (GDKP hype) then go back to SoD
[4:05:37] Bothurin: 0 raids
[4:05:41] rhaziaa: WotLK was the beginning of "retail".  Cata puts it on steroids.  If I wanted to play retail, I'd play retail.
[4:05:44] Derken11: FREEESH BatChesting
[4:05:45] Bothurin: lfg is empty on wotlk
[4:05:49] tonyg_1103: hc ssf will be great

[4:05:53] Nice_n_Dicey: true
[4:05:54] kharma99: and then
[4:05:54] 21up21: every classic expansion loses players though
[4:05:55] mopchild: i think SoD overall is just more popular
[4:05:56] YuruNeko1: ''IM NOT PLAYING IT=0 PLAYERS'' ICANT ''IM NOT PLAYING IT=0 PLAYERS'' ICANT ''IM NOT PLAYING IT=0 PLAYERS'' ICANT
[4:05:58] Sypro90: no way cata pulls that much hype as wrath
[4:06:03] kharma99: THE WAR WITHIN WILL KILL THE GAME ENTIRELY ICANT
[4:06:03] mopchild: even if this part of the phase where its dead its more active
[4:06:08] grimnrsix: @YuruNeko1 the CLASSIC brain rot take
[4:06:09] Oopogo1: Hot take: MoP classic will have 10x the hype of Cata
[4:06:16] iommixx: hope sod die miserably
