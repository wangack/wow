[0:51:43] Wulfgrym: @Circuitree I can't seem to find where to craft the rifles, i have the assembly line 2 but can't seem to find the recipe anywhere
[0:52:28] Circuitree: there’s another assembly level II that has it in the crafting section
[0:53:30] Wulfgrym: @Circuitree ahh i see, thanks
[0:53:38] Circuitree: I think it’s meant to be called level three, but I think there’s an error and it’s called level two

[1:19:58] Wulfgrym: i figure the ravens are going to the superbowl regardless who won last night
[1:20:20] Sollice: There were a couple of passes at the end of the game that Bills WRs should have gotten
[1:20:23] PepikStep: Starting retirement off well
[1:20:25] Wulfgrym: Jason Kelce is the gigachad man
[1:20:34] Sollice: So yeah the kicker lost it...but he may not needed to lose it
[1:20:46] falldrgn: Has he confirmed he would retire? I know he kinda walked it back
[1:20:52] SanshY95: how you can chage the server settings towllie? on dedicate server , i dont find yet
[1:20:52] wEiRdO_dUdE: Freaking kickers LUL
[1:21:08] SanshY95: like death penalty etc
[1:21:08] OGaxelaw: kicker didnt lose it they blew chances to score the whole game he just added on to misses

[1:21:47] falldrgn: @OGaxelaw ^ this.. Kicker didn't do his job, but the rest of the team didn't do theirs either.
[1:21:56] wEiRdO_dUdE: What got me was that the missed kicked there wasn't blocked and there wasn't much wind... it was just shanked
[1:22:03] OGaxelaw: plus wouldnt the kicker have just sent it to overtime? didnt lose it just didnt tie it up
[1:22:11] PigPenLen: sup redsoxrob at chat, happy monday towHAMUP towLets towGo towHi
[1:22:25] Kitsua: If base borders overlap they're too close
[1:22:38] Sollice: @OGaxelaw He didn't make the kick. By not making the kick he lost them the game
[1:22:55] wEiRdO_dUdE: We gotta find a better spot!
[1:23:01] Sollice: The kick wouldn't have won them the game
[1:23:03] Sanitizah: look of ledge towards ocean there was another base
[1:23:14] the_bad_goat: Man I don't see where to sub with my prime button anymore. It's not under the resubscribe windwo
[1:23:14] Gooflinger: you will want to be in a huge flat area to start a base. just FYI

[1:23:54] wEiRdO_dUdE: For Prime there should be a box to click when you scroll down on that one page
[1:23:58] Verdell263: @the_bad_goat Is your sub completely over?
[1:24:08] ambiotic: I opened 5 mega boxes of Prizm Football yesterday and I would have prob made more back if I just set a pile of money on fire.
[1:24:16] the_bad_goat: Yeah I'm getting ads
[1:24:19] EllisTheMenace1: Find somewhere flat or you will have big issues placing stuff
[1:24:23] Sanitizah: go to north beginner islands if you die you can travel there and start new
[1:24:30] Sollice: @the_bad_goat You use prime on this channel?
[1:24:31] Molvonos: @BVRlive Yep, I pinned the instructions you gave me in the Palworld channel we have on our Disc server

[1:27:00] Kaykerrs: yep
[1:27:00] Molvonos: Correct
[1:27:15] Aethn: if you code it no one can
[1:27:23] the_bad_goat: I did, nothing shows up but the amazon saying that I can subscribe for free. Yet when I try to go sub to Towelliee it only pops up $4.99
[1:27:40] Sollice: And you didn't let your Amazon Prime account lapse?
[1:27:57] Aethn: i loaded 300 ore into your box last night Towellieee since you said ppl took yours
[1:27:58] Alaquane: did you cancel your amazon prime?
[1:28:06] sageakl: did it actually expire yet
[1:28:11] the_bad_goat: Not that I know of. Wife continues having stuffed ship to the house with prime
[1:28:28] the_bad_goat: I will see
[1:28:29] Denhuuf: Hi all
[1:28:34] absolutflipz: sometimes have to go to your desktop if you’re on mobile/iPad or whatever
[1:28:41] Sollice: @the_bad_goat Reach out to Twitch support then if you have confirmed your Amazon Prime is still active https://help.twitch.tv/s/contactsupport?language=en_US
[1:28:45] NickLeonhearth: Diablo Kappa
[1:28:46] Alaquane: maybe your twitch / prime integration broke?
[1:28:54] Kaykerrs: yes
[1:28:54] Aethn: no
[1:28:59] Gooflinger: yes
[1:29:01] snuffles_80: Might take a few hours for prime to be available after running out
[1:29:01] wEiRdO_dUdE: True, the gifted subs should be flying, that mount is not bad
[1:29:02] Kaykerrs: They will respawn
[1:29:07] GodKingMuninn: depends on the settings
[1:29:09] Airantoos: around you. inside dont know
[1:29:11] Aethn: only grow back it its not covered
[1:29:13] sageakl: yes unless you build over them
[1:29:13] raldrik: @Sollice Is there anyone left in twitch support? lol
[1:29:28] Gooflinger: 100% yes. lvl 35 here. ore too
[1:29:30] Sollice: I am sure there is some AI bot that will attempt to help you out
[1:29:37] notdustinx: yes
[1:29:43] Alaquane: did your wife associate yalls prime account with her twitch?
[1:29:43] Aethn: if you build a house on top of the spawn point they wont regrow
[1:29:49] sageakl: ore deposits are good inside a base
[1:29:53] ambiotic: just check your subscriptions page and see if its being used
[1:30:02] Sollice: He already checked sub page
[1:30:05] BlewGamingGroup: most games wont have a tree grow if there is something like a house foundation placed on the tile where the tree would normally grow
[1:30:11] BVRlive: @Towelliee fixed a few more save files for the community, mind if we do a quick reboot?
[1:30:33] notdustinx: A trick is to build a base surrounding an area of ore. Build are the ore deposits, as they will respawn once a day, as long as nothing is built on top of the ore spot
[1:30:53] notdustinx: build around*

[1:30:59] Aethn: @Towelliee find an ore deposit and build a base there
[1:31:04] CeruleanStar: yeah all the nodes will respawn, assuming you have *NOT* built over their spawn
[1:31:09] Sollice: @Towelliee Read BVR message
[1:31:12] Kaykerrs: You can just fast travel to places with ore right next to the teleport
[1:31:32] sageakl: reboot
[1:31:43] notdustinx: @Kaykerrs Yes but the trick is to get mining spec pals who will just mine the ore as it spawns in base
[1:31:50] Aethn: look for ore spot
[1:32:06] Molvonos: That's my base over there to the left
[1:32:09] Aethn: go to the right i see ore
[1:32:15] Molvonos: And I have it right on the cliff, so it takes up little space
