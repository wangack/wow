[4:21:01] soupdog55: the orbs will change based on the circles you drop throughtout p1
[4:21:22] tharawow: you guys are also still messing up P1 soaks and fire storm placements thats why you get more balls than you should
[4:21:27] tharawow: making intermission harder for no reason
[4:21:33] tharawow: but it will be cleaner eventually ok
[4:22:14] Orthyrus: @Thalinan oh rlly? i dont know much about wow tbh i just assumed this was like normal level content
[4:22:44] Thalinan: @Orthyrus no wow can be pretty braindead and you never have to do content that strains your brain unless you want to
