[0:43:28] Holysal: @drakhangaming bc they have 1 shot
[0:43:32] warrenny: @thunderbrew Belf lock for me
[0:43:33] MrGattz: i wouldnt say its a scam at all
[0:43:43] MrGattz: they are trying to find a time that isnt near anything blizzard related
[0:43:44] SarosusieI: They know that, thats why the delay
[0:43:54] Thunderbrew: @warrenny My group of friends needs a tank, so  I'm it
[0:44:00] MrGattz: its true though, they DID know about tbc prepatch
[0:44:04] GRVPHX: Good Morning :)
[0:44:04] bruhSit_farmer: compete with 9.1, itll be much easier
[0:44:07] warrenny: @thunderbrew Fair
[0:44:28] Shrenko: @hjo1992 true
[0:44:37] GCnT: New Trailer for New World coming out today! towHype towHype towHype
[0:44:38] warrenny: 40-60 alot faster in prepatch?
[0:44:40] bruhSit_farmer: 29th of june 9.1 ?!?
[0:44:42] bruhSit_farmer: what
[0:44:57] Shrapnel_1974: How is the game looking... WoW killer?  haha
[0:45:00] MetallicusGaming: warrenny yes
[0:45:02] MrGattz: @warrenny 30% faster
[0:45:03] Thunderbrew: @warrenny I've read 30% faster
[0:45:08] Shrenko: @GCnT how do you know its a new trailer? :O I only saw their teaser thing on Twitter, thought it was a new alpha phase
[0:45:09] twistedstick1: WoW once again with the cock block.
[0:45:28] MrGattz: @twistedstick1 to be completely fair, tbc announced the date first.
[0:45:31] MetaKuron: Doesn't help me getting over the star citizen vibes with this one
[0:45:46] Blvdman: Theres no way 9.1 is june 29th PepeHands wont be near a pc from june 26 to july 7th PepeHands
[0:45:47] anxietyrising: I assume it is just not ready yet, at least not ready enough to look good
[0:46:08] xanarel22: xanarel22 subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 3 months! hallo
[0:46:11] HotHotHeals: so many games failed in the last year from poor beta alpha performances. I believe in riot
[0:46:27] MrGattz: look at new world. they delayed like 15 times and moved stuff back and everything more times than anyone. atm its looking like a really good game even though it was suppose to launch like a year ago.
[0:46:38] bruhSit_farmer: if only they were ran by blizzard, they'd just push AoC out now lawl
[0:47:07] GCnT: @Shrenko Go to your YOutube Channel. It says This is Aeternum Trailer Premiers in 3 hours
[0:47:10] KaisenSiru: monkaHmm
[0:47:31] HotHotHeals: CoachCamoCarry subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 10 months! 2 more to go
[0:47:57] MrGattz: @Volly i meannnn... your mostly right yeah. and if its a bad time to send out ads, like near a wow tbc prepatch launch, then why spend the money on ad space when its going to get ignored.

[0:47:58] Shrenko: @MrGattz I had fun testing New World but wasnt really impressed with the endgame it had to offer. remember they were supposed to be launching the game in that state. but over the past year they have been doing some huuuge progress on New World though, rewamped alot of stuff, added dungeons, endgame zones etc. looks very good

[0:49:28] wolfjc_69: thanks
[0:49:30] Quaras_: WIsh I could get access to that Test, Sadge not a streamer yet :D
[0:49:33] zapiiiiiiii: @Razzin_ he used to sell snake oil
[0:49:52] anxietyrising: they can say alpha is for all these things all they want, but literally all anyone will care about is how it looks, and how it plays
[0:49:55] bruhSit_farmer: Ion +
[0:49:57] Hank_ish: i think they longer a dev team waits to bring out a good game  the beeter
[0:49:57] bruhSit_farmer: lol

[0:50:40] Carahail: morning ,OO ashes
[0:50:41] Koravd: Ion Resurrected
[0:50:47] Quaras_: @MrGattz LUL
[0:50:47] Snacktooth: Sean Murray loved the spotlight before NMS
[0:51:22] geokouts: did they say Tentacles???
[0:51:27] Quaras_: I am sooooo intrigued about Ashes, like what's it goin be like
[0:51:56] Mr_Abeon: getting feelings of deja vu from cyberpunk 2077 vibes from this
[0:52:11] coldhandsbeatz: I cant be the only one who doesnt really like the AoC aesthetic. WoW’s is the best for me but I would take New World too
[0:52:11] Moobot: Towelliee has not moved, he is renovating his streaming room over the next month or so. The stream will be scuffed, the audio will be different, but it will be worth it! Soon™
[0:52:12] Razzin_: @Snacktooth wouldnt say that, I thinik he hated it but he had to do it, hes introverted
[0:52:13] MrGattz: well look at NMS now. its like an extreme success. sure they fucked up big time but they figured their shit out and did everything properly to be where they are now.
[0:52:31] Aaradin: It's probably for the best
[0:52:52] Blvdman: question: Wasnt is AoC that made that shitty BR and to make the combat system and they revamping that again?
[0:52:58] Clicklesly: Changing core game system this late is pretty weird...
[0:53:11] Shrenko: they have like 20+ cosmetic packs on their website allready, its abit sketchy yeah
[0:53:12] Jay_rb: $200 for a limited mount incoming KEKW
[0:53:20] MrGattz: cyberpunk imo is still a failed game at its core. if they can manage pull a NMS though..
[0:53:21] Snacktooth: @Razzin_ he sure did a lot of interviews and went on late shows etc. but i can see he has a shy kind of personality
[0:53:26] Shrapnel_1974: I dont mind delays to much to make sur ethey get it right... So many good ideas went in the shit can because not enough tweaking... IE Conan Hyborian Adventures Etc Etc
[0:53:40] coldhandsbeatz: AoC releasing late 2022 or 2023 at least I say
[0:53:41] SarosusieI: Ha called it lmao
[0:54:15] Phantomstrk: Well atleast they came out and said where they were, unlike wow which would of just rolled it out and said nothing.  These things make sense based on what they said, plus they seen the writing on the wall with TBC  so they delayed because of that.
[0:54:20] SpoonManes: nms? no mans sky?
[0:54:28] MrGattz: yeah nms is no mans sky
[0:54:54] zapiiiiiiii: Steven and his family used to be heavily  connected to MLM company
[0:55:13] Thoreya: they better make sure its good!
[0:55:14] Snacktooth: hardcore
[0:55:14] idenkaz_: good call
[0:55:19] MrGattz: @zapiiiiiiii while not wrong im not sure if it carries over to this.
[0:55:19] Vexxsis: Morning People
[0:55:19] Thoreya: first impressions are everything for mmos
[0:55:20] 210Crawler: Cubs dont mess with the Bear
[0:55:21] fooxytv: it's delayed again?
[0:55:29] MetaKuron: You could say, Blizzard is the alpha ;)
[0:55:29] raymond3195: it's a cash grab will never launch
[0:55:31] grylz89: AoC will live and more than likely die by its combat system. if the combat isnt amazing it will flop unfortunately @towelliee
[0:55:36] Blvdman: Revamping the combat system? It must have been pretty bland lol
[0:55:38] bruhSit_farmer: itd be stupid to go at tbc
[0:55:41] bruhSit_farmer: go at 9,1
[0:55:42] Thoreya: WoW is ded tho
[0:55:42] Clicklesly: So now they're moving it to 9.1 launch time instead of TBC Kappa
[0:55:43] twistedstick1: Next TBC gets pushed back.
[0:55:45] zapiiiiiiii: that company got banned in italy  for being so close to pyramid scheme
[0:55:50] MetallicusGaming: he's prolly delaying so he can lvl his own Draenei shaman in Pre patch to 60 Kappa
[0:56:00] Shrenko: 9.1 aint gonna delay nothing
[0:56:00] Thoreya: 9.1 gonna be in july and AoC is gonna be fucked lol
[0:56:14] Blvdman: Wait where the sources of 9.1 in june 29th
[0:56:19] DrakhanGaming: september
[0:56:24] bruhSit_farmer: 9.1 lol more torghast and maw what a game

[0:56:49] Koravd: Bruh people aint that hyped for 9.1 for them to delay AOC, TBC? Sure
[0:56:55] Shrenko: @Ezekyler yes new trailer apperantly in 3 hours
[0:56:56] kageless1: nahh they can fk around with retail lmao
[0:56:57] bruhSit_farmer: 9.1 has hype ??
[0:57:01] Supwizy: the new Final fantasy just says "fall 2021" so we need wait for that date to drop to know blizzards date KEKW
[0:57:04] Phantomstrk: what sources for 9.1 in June...the rumor mill was all saying end of july, what's changed
[0:57:13] Thoreya: yeah the world first race gonna get like 300k viewers during Aoc launch
[0:57:15] Thoreya: eek
[0:57:20] Koravd: @Vexxsis Theres no date yet
[0:57:28] Rottencoarse: @Towelliee  you siad 9.1 stuff coming around june 29th correct?
[0:57:31] Blvdman: The excuse will be "random system errors causing alpha to be very unstable" no eta
[0:57:39] Vexxsis: @koravd  august watch...
[0:58:08] raymond3195: bull just not ready. to launch
[0:58:10] MrGattz: idk that id call it the most ambition but.
[0:58:17] MrGattz: ambitious*
[0:58:26] Thoreya: ohhh
[0:58:26] grylz89: AoC will live and more than likely die by its combat system. if the combat isnt amazing it will flop unfortunately @towelliee
[0:58:28] idenkaz_: na reset
[0:58:28] Thoreya: that makes sense
[0:58:31] Jay_rb: 5Head
[0:58:39] bruhSit_farmer: 9.1 will save shadowlands
[0:58:39] Koravd: @Vexxsis Dude the only thing ill watch is the Fan Fest to tell me the date not a random Twitch user xD
[0:58:50] Moobot: Check out Towelliee's latest Youtube video! https://youtu.be/U8-64zqVa8k Shadowlands needs some help
[0:58:55] Thunderbrew: Is it weird to drop TBC then a month later release 9.1?
[0:59:05] anxietyrising: The longer delay can only help their presentation
[0:59:08] Alexkayzz: might as well bring the yellow delay background cyberpunk style Kappa
[0:59:14] Rottencoarse: @Towelliee  i dont think they wanna fuck around with either world first or patch release day
[0:59:21] bruhSit_farmer: if 9.1 flops atleast we have tbc
[0:59:24] warrenny: Bc phase 2?
[0:59:29] idenkaz_: summer after covid? could affect some launches here and there.
[0:59:32] SarosusieI: Tell that to Duke nukem
[1:00:12] MrGattz: @magemyway were not sure if there is an after covid yet, idk if companies should be basing their launches off it
[1:00:13] Aktz_: wows team tho OMEGALUL
[1:00:15] mozavich: small indie company
[1:00:31] TheBeardedAussie: Intrepid is recruiting very rapidly
[1:00:38] bruhSit_farmer: retail only delivers content like a small indie
[1:01:08] byrdeen45: YA THEY GOT YOUR MONEY WHY GIVE YOU THE GAME
[1:01:20] warrenny: @hjo1992 Brand new raid every day sound good?

[1:30:21] belfastcl: so, was yesterday's j allen thing fake or not
[1:30:29] RonUSMC: @Towelliee hey buddy.. I don't play WoW, but saw a video that you might be able to explain? Saw a guy with 10-12 accounts killing characters .. and then all of them getting banned. Something about buff ganking or something. Is banning for that a big deal?
[1:30:42] MrGattz: so its real LUL
[1:30:45] littlehelle: is it even possible for a regular person to go 1-60 in 2 weeks
[1:31:10] mewkittymon: The quest to small dark iron is off the dwarf room it hidden you need gold and jams for it.
[1:31:11] MrGattz: yeah
[1:31:18] subversv: why would he respond to some random guy though
[1:31:23] MrGattz: because you can get in some serious trouble if it was fake
[1:31:24] Shrenko: what was leaked?
[1:31:30] Aquadriel: JAB doesnt have a twitter
[1:31:31] plc_lol: Whats this "email"?

[1:31:36] belfastcl: at least they would've had a middle  man telling known content creators that it was fake
[1:32:03] PadidinJones: But how dumb do you have to be to post that shit?
[1:32:07] Pippinn: what happened?
[1:32:09] Mo0fal: what happend?
[1:32:10] freshlife: Yeah a person who uses 10/12 accounts to kill people should be banned from society
[1:32:18] Broomba: PR and damage control or seeking routes to deal with situations
[1:32:18] Moobot: Towelliee has not moved, he is renovating his streaming room over the next month or so. The stream will be scuffed, the audio will be different, but it will be worth it! Soon™

[1:33:49] fluffy_fingerz: I haven't played wow so u think classic is going to catch up with retail at some point
[1:33:56] Shrenko: everyone is clueless of what you are talking about Towelliee
[1:33:58] AjjtheDK: Towelliee  is like Lysol generally 99.99% effective on his words.

[1:38:10] Redhed_Iou: can't get over how good the background looks!

[2:07:26] acee626: fuck outriders bro, they need to be focusing their time on fixing their broken ass game they sold for $60 instead of doing PR marketing.

[2:09:30] acee626: Outriders was fun but unfinished, and they have been putting almost ZERO work in fixing game breaking issues, they sold a early beta access game as a full game for $60.  Shity company, they deserve losing 90% of the playerbase

[2:12:47] mewkittymon: Yes
[2:12:47] Specsifier: outriders sounded like a really good single player game. i didn't know it was multiplayer until i watched you play it

[2:25:39] raptorstrick: Yeah I still use it. Mining/skinning
[2:25:49] PansaJones: In your opinion is it worth boosting a new char for TBC? And do you think this will negatively impact gameplay in general considering that the system is different from Retail for new players or does it matter?

[2:29:32] capricore: $35 is stupid, a small fee like $5-10 I can understand, though it really should be free like a ptr character copy

[2:49:59] raldrik: tbc command should be updated since we have dates
[2:50:21] Strouss: i think for me it would be a piupe dream. im skilled but having back issues i dont know when my surgery is yet. that would define it.
[2:50:23] Cranghoul: My guild is on mankrik currently but we might transfer off if they open free transfers. @towelliee
[2:50:35] Adraythien: Wasn't there "hints" a while back that players from EU and NA would be able to play together?

[2:51:55] honeychonker: i would literally pay £100 to get my unobtainable shit moved to NA
[2:52:12] superfreak2k0: Where the doggo at?
[2:52:26] Riggoz1: I hope tbc is out for atleast 2 months before 9.1 comes out tbh

[2:52:49] Daggerstry: Anima to grind!
[2:52:59] Adraythien: @CadzFPS I think there were some "variables" or whatever it was on a PTR(retail) that mentioned that
[2:53:13] DigitalChill: wrong, moobot, wrong!
[2:53:19] honeychonker: i still need 68,000 anima to collect everything for Night fae, and theres a possibility venthyr might become the play in 9.1, its soul destroying
[2:53:33] mr3machine: The state of r/wow is disgusting atm, Blizz hatred is stifling
[2:53:39] cabalish: moobot old
[2:53:43] TheNoobTaurenDruid: yes
[2:53:48] Adraythien: @veox89 And can you play without lag? Aren't the timezones a bit too diferent for raids and such?
[2:53:57] Thunder4o: so you think 9.1 will be at the very end of June ?
[2:54:20] TheRealZum: I haven't transferred my char over yet but my old guildies are hopping on your server so I will be on there soon towHorde
[2:54:21] thiccsushi: its not bad they are just exaggerating
[2:54:26] throwawaym3: Its been cool to hate blizzard and wow since like 2016

[2:54:32] mr3machine: Ahh maybe its because of the interview

[2:57:03] Catspaw66: peeps triggered about tbc deluxe edition. they'll be pepehands meltdown with wow tokens in classic
[2:57:11] EulerGRJ: My only concern is that the boost is way too cheap, bots are gonna use the hell out of it
[2:57:14] Broomba: i think blizzard was pure before games added a store and they wanted the old blizzard back
[2:57:16] LGilbert1982: I dislike the current state of the game, so I just quit. Still support the streamers tho, and don't sit in their chats just constantly bashing wow tho, because I still love WoW. Just don't like shadowlands /shrug
[2:57:20] mr3machine: Store mounts hatred is one thing, but the /spit mentality is just toxi

[2:59:33] Aeylid: I got some riding skill for ya
[2:59:34] Mecabeast: epic riding was what 100g
[2:59:35] EulerGRJ: epic riding is 650g now if u are exalted

[2:59:43] ArcaneSyntax: @Towelliee you don't have to buy the mount, the riding still costs money, the mount is like 90g
[2:59:48] Mecabeast: the mount was 900
[2:59:53] dalaraz: theres no epic riding now
[3:00:11] LeonardLongNips: the cost gets shifted to epic riding

[3:12:57] bruhSit_farmer: what happened to the world aspect in WoW, sadge
[3:12:59] VladVolynine: @mr3machine There are definitely dailies but I don't know if they are important? I think they are tied to cosmetics or extra fluff stuff. At one point they had some kind of a grind but that was a long ago patch, there is no grind anymore at the end of each patch except for the top end raids and... a token like system?
[3:13:01] sinlesssinner: @Towelliee you are going to be mad at me, but i mean this with honestly and not in a shitty way; You cant quit WoW :p ever i think its THE game for you. And thats awesome!
[3:13:16] Aeylid: Looking at you xavius
[3:13:20] mr3machine: @VladVolynine thanks :) Im always tempted to try
[3:13:23] Mecabeast: personally I think content wise 9.0 was better than 8.0 length of patch is where the let down is. didn't play prior to 8.0
[3:13:24] Aeylid: Looking at fucking you
[3:13:45] luckfore: shadowlands has killed my wow journey
[3:13:49] Heyhowsitgoingtonight: The rest of the expansion was good so.....
[3:13:50] VladVolynine: @mr3machine If you love FF and their worlds + story, it's 100% worth, imo.
[3:14:08] Aeylid: Yeah but you mentioned tuning and that’s always the one that I’m like…bruhhh
[3:14:10] trivwik: Best boe farm ever
[3:14:10] honeychonker: but traash is when i AFK to pee
[3:14:11] throwawaym3: What does Ion and all the devs think about people constantly screeching on the forums?
[3:14:15] Caibo1: other than faction champs togc was good
[3:14:28] eatonaround: fuck faction Champs haha
[3:14:36] Thoreya: Wow is the only that satisfies my needs. And don’t have any interest/time in playing another game so if I ever not have fun with it. I just won’t play. Crazy concept
[3:14:37] BeeaRcLaw: gz on 60 man :) currently leveling my new main myself, horde shaman :p
[3:14:38] Caibo1: togc gets a bad rep because it came after ulduar
[3:14:40] PokerFaceMoose: dang maybe im in the minority but i liked faction champs
[3:14:49] illuminationpaladincurse: totally disconnected
[3:15:02] VladVolynine: @Thoreya whoa whoa, easy there with the rationality and common sense :)

[3:15:10] Amarlian: He communicated!
[3:15:13] illuminationpaladincurse: first bad move was giving alliance seal of the martyr
[3:15:15] mavericks312: ghostcrawler would roast a forum lol
[3:15:18] Caibo1: @PokerFaceMoose I didn't mind the fight. It was frustrating to prog with my guild at the time
[3:15:22] MrGattz: i wouldnt get involved either if i was the
[3:15:24] MrGattz: them
[3:15:24] CADZtv: did asmon tell
[3:15:26] Bullviine: Didn't Ghostcrawler really hate Retribution Paladins?
[3:15:38] kamisengames: Paladins in general
[3:15:38] rhodeos_: its like they full send into one direction, then take feed back for 90+ days from now
[3:15:58] datswassup: hard to take a lot of gamers seriously
[3:16:11] blizuzi: ion is a mythic raider?
[3:16:19] aikopooh: they working as filter to exact lolz
[3:16:27] Warjun11: Cheer20
[3:16:28] PokerFaceMoose: i feel ya. it was not an easy fight.
[3:16:31] duffluv22: Ion hates Demo warlocks...lol
[3:16:41] ArcaneSyntax: I don't care about conduit energy
[3:16:45] Aeylid: GOD DAMN TRUE!
[3:16:46] Mecabeast: "read"
[3:16:56] Thoreya: They got rid of artifact power and gave us less loot after community feedback. And the community wanted it right back LUL
[3:17:03] Warjun11: hi
[3:17:04] Thoreya: And titanforging
[3:17:07] Sollice: Community: WHO ASKED FOR THIS? Blizzard: Someone, at some point, somewhere did
[3:17:13] Innersane: Diablo music !
[3:17:14] VladVolynine: @Towelliee CM is not a fun job, did that for a year for a certain company that at the time had the worst rep. You sift through trash and write formal reports everyday on it.
[3:17:15] Ulfinator: Imagine reading asmons or sodas chat 8hrs a day every day. I would kill myself
[3:17:27] Aeylid: No one is pro conduit energy…there are people that are indifferent but no is pro conduit energy
[3:17:43] jvandelli: what's conduit energy o.O
[3:17:44] mavericks312: I wanna know who suggested pokemon be put into wow though
[3:17:59] duffluv22: warmode off

[3:18:16] VladVolynine: @Sollice EA Vancouver :P
[3:18:27] Sollice: See EA's reputation proceeds itselfd
[3:18:35] Mecabeast: more people dislike than like conduit energy. even if the actual majority doesn't care they by technicality abstain and those go to the majority.

[3:20:11] Templexx: classic andies are a different breed lol
[3:20:16] Sollice: @Towelliee I was right he did
[3:21:13] TheNextKing306: they are humans, I'm sure they check twitter on breaks or on the toilet like the rest of us
[3:21:23] Amarlian: I wished they would have figured out how to mix conduits and different specs
[3:21:29] throwawaym3: i could care less about conduit energy lol
[3:21:36] throwawaym3: and i play regularly

[3:21:49] jvandelli: whats conduit energy?
[3:21:58] TheNextKing306: where do they get their info from without polling the players
[3:22:01] R2RHIN0: I haven't changed my conduits since I placed them months ago

[3:22:06] VladVolynine: I didn't know it existed until I decided to read the forums.
[3:22:19] Caibo1: I have a friend who plays very casually. He didn't know about the great vault until I showed him. So he gives 0 fucks about conduit energy
[3:22:24] Wheeellz: Blizz just has an obsession for putting in systems that limit off specs
[3:22:28] honeychonker: You could argue that if nobody gives a shit, or people dont actually notice it, then its a failed system
[3:22:28] Sollice: @Towelliee I think that kind of proves the point of not needing conduit energy. If your never running against the cap, whats the point in having the cap?
[3:22:28] sinlesssinner: we want them to spend more time on content, instead of wasting so much time on convoluted systems
[3:22:41] GrizlySword: Is conduit energy an issue for multi spec/role or no?
[3:22:50] Wheeellz: They have been limiting off specs since Legion and it's weird
[3:22:56] Digitree: if nobody is getting close to cap, then why have it in there to begin with?
[3:22:59] VladVolynine: @grizlysword Yes, I believe that's the point.
[3:22:59] Wildside1177: That is a simple database tool to find out exactly who used conduit energy.
[3:23:06] Brethren2K: I'm sure they can query just about any statistical data they need
[3:23:08] ArcaneSyntax: @Towelliee the problem with discussions on conduit energy is that blizzard has stated why it exists and no solutions present thus far have kept that in mind.
[3:23:13] sinlesssinner: i am talking in general, like for a new expac
[3:23:19] Mecabeast: the same argument that got rid of paying for respecs can likely be used for the energy
[3:23:33] sinlesssinner: just focus on dungs per patch instead of wasting time on fixing systems :'(
[3:23:54] VladVolynine: Corruptionforging PogChamp
[3:24:03] croco_405: yes :)
[3:24:08] sinlesssinner: i know lol i am saying they are doing good in that regard
[3:24:11] Phoecian: That's called a Raid Kappa
[3:24:13] rhodeos_: lol well we are only 4 years out of cata classic so lets see how people like all the raids coming out at once again
[3:24:21] GrizlySword: @VladVolynine Then that`s bad. But why can`t they just double the amount.

[3:24:41] Sodbox: @Hybridsteve Thanks for the gift sub!
[3:24:46] wrec7: i would agree

[3:24:53] mr3machine: What a boii
[3:24:53] rhodeos_: towHAMUP towHAMUP towHAMUP towGift towGift
[3:24:55] ArcaneSyntax: @Towelliee endgame without systems feels like FFXIV, which is basically been the same loop since 2.0
[3:25:00] AndrewShifuVA: where's the Dodge train?
[3:25:01] Sodbox: towHAMUP towHAMUP towHAMUP
[3:25:02] Alllprimer: SeemsGood
[3:25:02] captivate7: @Hybridsteve thank you for the sub <3
[3:25:04] Sodbox: THANKS STEVE
[3:25:09] VladVolynine: @grizlysword No idea my man
[3:25:11] throwawaym3: See TBC lol, Soooo balacned
[3:25:13] justlnquisitive: Players are content vampires. There will never be enough.
[3:25:13] Daggerstry: DODGED!
[3:25:14] sinlesssinner: yea the game would never be perfect, i agree with you
[3:25:17] rhodeos_: they cant balance it with the systems
[3:25:18] Domi98_: It would take them less effort to try to do it atleast
[3:25:26] sinlesssinner: but again, its not an either or, there is a middle
[3:25:37] KVANNORWICK: The game has never been balanced
[3:26:16] FatChase: I think they should make old raids from the same expansion relevant though
[3:26:28] HyoonKang: i would like see revamp of core systems.. last time i think we got is talent system revamp in mists
[3:27:03] KVANNORWICK: I am going to miss Convoke though
[3:27:21] TMMOOF: Nostalgia LUL
[3:27:26] Anthy1887: anima Kappa
[3:27:28] rohdey: especially with how long this tier has been
[3:27:33] JansonLives: please let me out of that castle.
[3:27:37] Sollice: Transmog. The plate set is pretty bad ass in CN
[3:27:37] honeychonker: Raid + Kappa
[3:27:38] death_fisted: Kara felt viable all bc
[3:27:41] aikopooh: satisfaction kappa
[3:27:42] Bullviine: what are they changing to convoke?
[3:27:52] AsapXO: sludgefist not so smart FeelsDankMan
[3:28:02] pk99: 3 days LUL
[3:28:02] Wheeellz: Anyone that says they want the old raids to be relevant just blindly listen to Asmongolds rambling
[3:28:08] Warjun11: Cheer20
[3:28:17] 4bmoney: i thought the scale trinket in bfa was a cool factor
[3:28:21] CipherEx: Remournia is what I want from that raid
[3:28:23] VladVolynine: @Towelliee I think they should've personally doubled down and kept on going hard with the Legion mentality of "change" and "evolution" so to speak, seems like they got afraid and are now in between design choices. IMO.
[3:28:27] honeychonker: the neck could have been our tie to azeroth in the SL and the coming cosmic war
[3:28:31] Caibo1: as a mythic raider I just want to move on to the new raid
[3:28:32] azzurrin: Who has time for that?  LMAO
[3:28:35] tri_bs: @Towelliee do u know if there will be fresh servers in tbc?
[3:28:46] rohdey: the only way that would 'work' is if they had overlapping tiers, with lower power creep and lower drop chance
[3:28:52] GrizlySword: No. We have timewalking for that later on. Take the best raids from each expansion.
[3:28:55] ColinMoore: trhere just needs to be less of a content drought
[3:28:58] Brethren2K: yes please dont give anything non-cosmetic for old content (not current tier)
[3:29:01] L0urdes: i think people want a progression system from raids without catch up systems so you have to go do dungeons to do castle > sylvanas raid and so on
[3:29:07] Mecabeast: just give us a satisfying gameplay loop
[3:29:09] Alexkayzz: The classic era servers are "new" servers, but not fresh I suppose
[3:29:11] kofifrog: bis warrior dps trinket during all of legion was that stupid trinket from nighthold, that sucked massive amounts of dick
[3:29:14] Desucakes: Hmm I suppose it's mostly for 'progression', rather than doing multiple raids at a time? New character starts at first raid. I'm not in favour, but I'm thinking that's how it'd work?
[3:29:21] TheClipBeat: they should do more shit like the mage tower frequently
[3:29:23] AsapXO: @Wheeellz if it wasnt for asmon the wow section on twitch would have died long time ago
[3:29:30] khrownoes: its was just so much easier for alts or casuals to get invites to raids actually play the game when they have time to do so. at this point if you raider IO isnt a tier above raid you trying to run no one want to invite you
[3:29:31] Brethren2K: and they nerfed it like 3 times?
[3:29:33] ColinMoore: 9.0 woiuldve been fine if it ended 2 months ago
[3:29:35] Caibo1: had to keep doing ulduar for the legendary
[3:29:42] throwawaym3: b-b-b-but the journey
[3:29:49] VladVolynine: @TheClipBeat Mage tower should've been an out of expansion addition that kept adding bosses every expac, would've been dope.
[3:30:00] Wheeellz: @asapxo oh no him and his 85% of his viewers that dont play the game
[3:30:12] honeychonker: Font yeah
[3:30:16] PvtHudson093: font of power
[3:30:17] Supwizy: WoW is a graveyard of abandoned content
[3:30:23] 91Niki: towHi
[3:30:24] Brethren2K: Legion had same thing, the trinket in nighthold
[3:30:27] Twill923: imma have on both realms
[3:30:29] eliano: Happened in legion too to an extent
[3:30:29] TheUnknowing: in current WoW, there is really no reason you should have to go back to old content. I know the whole 'loses relevancy blah blah' but thats how the game is designed now
[3:30:29] duffluv22: Wasn't Tol barad or wte out the same time another raid was out? And it dropped good gear???
[3:30:35] VladVolynine: @asapxo You'd be surprised to learn that millions of players don't care for Twitch
[3:30:38] Twill923: classic wow will never die
[3:30:43] lekkahdh: I hated coral oh my god
[3:30:53] Daggerstry: I still go back and farm old content for transmog
[3:31:06] MrGattz: classic wow will be dead in like 3 weeks @Twill923
[3:31:07] Calphurnious: It could easily be done but wouldn't ever happen
[3:31:08] Anthy1887: can't wait for the next unstable arcanocrystal that I need to farm for hoping for a new max level version
[3:31:22] aikopooh: well they add special  mounts/pets etc
[3:31:23] LeonardLongNips: @MrGattz ????
[3:31:25] Bullviine: what makes you think ti cant be doen Towelliee? Im intrested to know.
[3:31:26] Mayyo1987: make old raids challenge modes
[3:31:27] sinlesssinner: ppl that say they want content to alwways be relevant arent worth arguing with :p not sure why ppl always go to the extremes.
[3:31:29] throwawaym3: The achievement system was genius tbh
[3:31:32] sleeptime123: we need wow 2 then
[3:31:36] Brethren2K: yeah SWTOR did that. they came out with an expansion that just scaled all raids to same ilvl. It was AWFUL.
[3:31:39] Twill923: @MrGattz thats why blizzard made the same game twice and it made more than retyail
[3:31:39] Moobot: Check out Towelliee's latest Youtube video! https://youtu.be/U8-64zqVa8k Shadowlands needs some help
[3:31:42] Alexkayzz: I kinda want to play classic, but idk, feels like it's not gonna last long, like what do they do after ICC classic? @Towelliee
[3:31:44] capnkalland: waste of time
[3:31:44] Heyhowsitgoingtonight: PogChamp
[3:31:46] AsapXO: blizz only cares about the QER and not the players or even the game
[3:31:47] MrGattz: @LeonardLongNips tbc launch
[3:31:49] mmo_kenna_: They do it with time walking raids, black temple ulduar etc
[3:31:51] death_fisted: blizz took xbox live achievement system
[3:31:51] Mecabeast: personally I think it'd be better for the players to make them progress all raids from the expan say 9.2 someone starts guess what you need to do nathria and 9.1 raid first
[3:31:52] oldmangamer0: Nah thats exciting
[3:31:53] Caibo1: fuuuuck that noiser
[3:31:55] Anthy1887: need that 20 min sulfuron fight!
[3:31:58] Khooya_: that's....timewalking
[3:31:59] jeneraljelly: any time walking MC disasters in the chat
[3:32:01] oraclespyro: plus it  not ff
[3:32:03] Calphurnious: You can make all content relevant without scaling though
[3:32:06] LeonardLongNips: @LeonardLongNips I know. What you said is just wrong.
[3:32:10] Templexx: welcome to 2021
[3:32:12] rohdey: @Towelliee i could see that working if they made it drop something 'new' or 'relavent'
[3:32:14] MrGattz: wait why?
[3:32:15] GiraffeHydra_: @Towelliee no, they just use the lag feature to make it challenging. "enjoy that slideshow, bitches! Love, blizz"
[3:32:18] Twill923: @MrGattz classic private servers have been around since earely 00, even after tbc and they do wrath.. people will play classic
[3:32:19] PvtHudson093: remember the 15th anniversary, MC was a shit show
[3:32:22] khrownoes: guess its time for a "New World".....
[3:32:25] Mayyo1987: make them challenge modes, optional content, cosmetic rewards
[3:32:31] TrveTillDeath: @Towelliee Why is the current content so bad then?
[3:32:31] LeonardLongNips: @LeonardLongNips oh wait are you saying classic era servers?
[3:32:34] Bullviine: the nostalgia?
[3:32:34] LeonardLongNips: If so my bad
[3:32:36] mlinuxgada: chess is like thousand+ years ... depends on the gameplay
[3:32:37] MrGattz: i said classic will be dead in a few weeks. because tbc is taking it over.
[3:32:38] Brethren2K: the storyline. transmog.

[3:33:00] mlinuxgada: true
[3:33:03] honeychonker: Class quests, going back to solo old raids or some shit
[3:33:04] Broomba: cause its a time where they were younger and life was easier
[3:33:05] VladVolynine: @Kinghorn sign me up
[3:33:12] belfastcl: other games keep old content relevant, but they work with a different kind of itemization (5 piece sets) and dont add levels with expansions (so nothing like wow)
[3:33:17] VladVolynine: LUL
[3:33:19] Kinghorn: towQueen VladVolynine
[3:33:19] AsapXO: remember when you knew the name of gear?
[3:33:20] MrGattz: :P
[3:33:22] TheClipBeat: nothing just go make new content instead of recycling old content, just my opinion
[3:33:24] PharoGames: I think, its the vertical scaling model of wow that hurt it in the long run. One of the best decisions of GW2 was the concept of scaling content horizontally rather than keeping on adding player power.
[3:33:25] Bullviine: BDO do it Toweliee
[3:33:26] sanlanthus: imagine the balancing headache with gear from previous raids
[3:33:28] FresheFefe: happy merchant towllliee LUL
[3:33:31] latestkiller: yoo bro when you getting off TD? @Towelliee
[3:33:32] rhodeos_: legion did that right
[3:33:34] croco_405: so classic
[3:33:35] sagethemage40: I want the talent trees back to the way they were before MOP
[3:33:35] QuantumleaperGG: legion did that well
[3:33:36] mr3machine: Not a bad idea
[3:33:38] Bullviine: Their old content had been made viable again so I haev been told
[3:33:39] ColinMoore: i dont need anything new, just faster content, too mmuch time in between patches
[3:33:42] FyreK1ll3r: I quite enjoy the Warfronts and wouldn’t mind Blizzard expand on them
[3:33:43] AsapXO: now people know maybe 1 piece of gear they are wearing
[3:33:44] Eviltuna13: Turn older dungeons into mythic plus.
[3:33:53] VladVolynine: @Bullvine_007 all bad BDO things aside, their world is dope.
[3:34:00] sinlesssinner: see class quests, mage tower, simple content that ppl love but blizzard doesnt want to replicate :) thats what i mean by focus on content
[3:34:01] mlinuxgada: worlds scenarios mixture ... if in old zones, use old talent tree/mechanics
[3:34:02] LeonardLongNips: The bug area @Towelliee
[3:34:13] honeychonker: i mean the content is there, why not make it (semi) difficult, like a mage travelling back to the eye of eternity to upgrade your artifact or something
[3:34:15] WayneG947: like the lock green flame quest in BT? That was awesome. took me like 80 times to get it haha
[3:34:26] GiraffeHydra_: thats probably my biggest complaint since legion. Shit back then made me feel like a real *insert class*, now I just feel like a grunt with a different flavor of strong
[3:34:27] Swizzaman: It may just be time for faster expansion releases.
[3:34:27] Bullviine: @VladVolynine - i dont play BDO my friend does, he raes about it though and how they bring back old content and make it viable gain
[3:34:29] mmo_kenna_: back in TBC unless you were in one of the top guilds on the server you couldn't even do the likes of Black temple or sunwell
[3:34:31] Vosy1984: Hey Towelliee! Love the changes behind you! bleedPurple
[3:34:33] S1appadabass: I want a godamn SOO boss skip
[3:34:38] Brethren2K: I would like to have a difficult and/or time consuming class specific quest chain to give more class identity and give a worthwhile reward
[3:34:39] PvtHudson093: dosnt Silithus have Thorium?
[3:34:44] VladVolynine: @Bullvine_007 Ah wouldn't know, I was only there for 2 months at launch.
[3:34:47] Mecabeast: silithus caves are good if you have a group

[3:34:49] honeychonker: Yeah but add in some quests, some flavour, tune it so its still a wee bit difficult to solo
[3:34:54] greywind317: Tow what class are u maining for TBC
[3:35:03] duffluv22: Cant they make like the old hubs viable again? like sanctum halls and the old garrisons? its just there going to waste.
[3:35:05] Shrenko: @greywind317 is that even a question LUL
[3:35:09] gwar234: man i want gear drops to not be crap, i love raiding and the drops are still crap even though bliz says they made a better system, i have yet to see the plate shoulders from hungering drop once on norm and heroic and do both weekly
[3:35:15] Heyhowsitgoingtonight: PogChamp Ice cream citadel
[3:35:16] throwawaym3: Arent these people describing time walking lol?
[3:35:18] death_fisted: they do that with time walking
[3:35:18] greywind317: Lol no your right
[3:35:19] Bullviine: @Towelliee - ITs a shame as the old content is great stuff that a lot f new people coming to the game and even old people wont get to witness other than for bulldshit transmog runs
[3:35:21] Brayy47: people need to move on and realize that they will never get that nostalgic feeling they dream of
[3:35:23] Daggerstry: Look at the nightmare of them remaking Scarlet Halls and UBRS relevant to MoP and Draenor
[3:35:24] daftmath: for what w pay they should be able to do both xD
[3:35:26] rhodeos_: keep that in timewalking, but throw us some old bosses in choregast
[3:35:28] daftmath: we*
[3:35:29] DyedFuelOnly: server shut down in 8
[3:35:29] Shongoshi: arent they doing that with timewalking already?
[3:35:29] HyoonKang: i mean they are multi billiondollar company they can do both
[3:35:31] aikopooh: how about wintergrasp for thorium but not exactly it can be found there or no
[3:35:33] ZenjiBro: They gave us timewalking events, what more do people want from old content?
[3:35:39] Unlivedsam: New content > old content
[3:35:48] throwawaym3: Timewalking events, BAM!
[3:35:48] gooni_coyg: Need to decide between warlock and rogue 😜
[3:35:49] TheClipBeat: I actually don't care that much what they do as long as they do not take nearly 1 year to actually realise some relevant content
[3:35:49] VladVolynine: @Towelliee The obsession with everything having to be endless in every game is very odd.
[3:35:50] raizanava: @towelliee will you be able to boost a Bloodelf on PP?
[3:35:53] Nico_vdM: Did that paladin leave Badlands?
[3:35:56] mr3machine: We have Timewalking and Classic/TBC but people still want old stuff
[3:35:58] Shrenko: you need to see the lvl 70 beta server @Towelliee its lagging in Shattrath because the place is paaacked
[3:36:00] Nico_vdM: Or is he still out there farming?
[3:36:03] Brayy47: its a different time in life you most likely arent playing with the people you were playing with at the time and your knowledge for the game is much higher
[3:36:06] GiraffeHydra_: @roscodashx now that'd be cool, m+ timewalking
[3:36:12] Swizzaman: Blizzard needs to just release content at a faster cadence, then gamers wouldn't worry about older content. IMHO.
[3:36:13] Calphurnious: @nedyarb8 A good game doesn't need nostalgia to drive it
[3:36:14] mrmanno14: HOT TUB STREAM DURING MAINTENANCE
[3:36:17] Phoecian: Yeah is Timewalking not enough??
[3:36:19] sinlesssinner: whats Classic WoWs size? anyone know? @chat
[3:36:22] Brethren2K: If everything was relevant, we would have overload of stuff we would feel potentially obligated too do. MORE weekly and seasonal and limited time events would be enjoyable.
[3:36:34] MrGattz: @mrmanno14 probly not
[3:36:35] AsapXO: anima sucks, torghast sucks soul ash sucks, covs sucks
[3:36:36] Alexkayzz: @Towelliee  the SL pet trainers are lit bro, do those Kappa
[3:36:36] Heyhowsitgoingtonight: grind anima?
[3:36:41] evantmikhaelsyeba: Booster Pack 58 worth it or not ????
[3:36:42] WyattStav: @sinlesssinner like 4g
[3:36:44] Nico_vdM: Classic WoW is a couple of gigs iirc
[3:36:44] mrmanno14: :(
[3:36:45] MiniPenny: @sinlesssinner 400mb if you have the classic already
[3:36:48] PvtHudson093: I miss my Neck grinding
[3:36:50] VladVolynine: I phrased that wrong, because I agree with that.
[3:36:52] mr3machine: @asapxo this isnt r/wow, just a heads up
[3:36:56] sinlesssinner: @WyattStav oh for realz?
[3:37:04] Mecabeast: to early for 50x60
[3:37:07] lovecult85: man i miss the artifact weapons! i loved the whole idea, and even the grind... and i am a boomer casual
[3:37:07] WyattStav: @sinlesssinner maybe less? something like that
[3:37:07] sinlesssinner: @WyattStav k cool i ll install it for shitz and giggles
[3:37:08] cruzeal: i miss the grind too
[3:37:09] MrGattz: @mr3machine lol.
[3:37:20] AsapXO: @mr3machine good one
[3:37:21] Caibo1: I never want to do an endless grind again. This patch is just too long which is why you have nothing to do
[3:37:23] rhodeos_: it kinda bums me out that going back to TBC(no offence to anyone about to play it for the first time), seems to be more rewarding then continuing my shadowlands character..
[3:38:01] WaikikiSmoke: that was cool
[3:38:07] Bullviine: @Towelliee - Do you not think it would be great that old dungeons were scaled up to current levels? Or do you not want that at all?
[3:38:07] Fluisterwoud: ohh yes..that was so nice

[3:38:08] Brethren2K: yeah that class specific stuff was great
[3:38:11] Nico_vdM: You guys remember when they allowed people to be exalted with that centaur faction and everyone and their mother went there?
[3:38:12] S1appadabass: I literally just want loot drops improved, it takes so long to gear up
[3:38:13] Brethren2K: so iconic
[3:38:15] Shallo1988: legion was the most fun i had in wow since BC
[3:38:17] rhodeos_: legion questing had me flipping my desk with how excited i was
[3:38:21] mr3machine: Legion nostalgia is high these days, people fucking hated that shite on release but now its best xpac
[3:38:22] Mecabeast: gacha games are on point with their limited time events
[3:38:24] DEVONIC27: 10000000
[3:38:26] aikopooh: true it was fun
[3:38:55] falldrgn: I loved class legendary quests., like the Ulduar mace, and the Dragonwrath staff.
[3:38:55] VladVolynine: I missed Legion because of RL, the only expac I've ever missed. BibleThump BibleThump
[3:38:56] sinlesssinner: @Towelliee YES thats AWESOME, its just trinkets tho lol
[3:38:59] aikopooh: i still remembering going to icc for fire  mage artifact
[3:39:04] manmower: dont lock us into specific gear
[3:39:04] Moobot: towGreen Shadowlands Limited Edition TOWELLIEE covenant shirts AND Towelliee hats are LIVE! check them out HERE! | Dbh.la/towelliee towBlue
[3:39:12] GiraffeHydra_: @Towelliee i'd just be happy with a class-specific questline for the story tbh
[3:39:13] sinlesssinner: and even then they dont have to give us TRINKETS, its not all about gear
[3:39:14] Muff_Sniffer: mounts and transmog for class quests aka pally and warlock mounts
[3:39:20] fizzleblast127: Unless they made it cosmetic
[3:39:20] S1appadabass: Running a dungeon with 5 bosses, and not getting a piece of gear, feels like shit
[3:39:22] sifer007: go back to the roots enchant gems etc no need for those systems
[3:39:28] manmower: i dont want legendary weapons to come back
[3:39:31] Eviltuna13: Class quests with cosmetics only no items
[3:39:38] Aravarth: Honestly, that's why Classic / TBC / WotLK were so great -- the games were relatively simple
[3:39:41] sinlesssinner: just give us quests to do, i still remember the Link quest back in vanilla, it was awesome, gave me shit for gear, but i still remember it
[3:39:46] Sodbox: towHAMUP towGold
[3:40:00] luckfore: it doesnt matter if theyre bad
[3:40:06] Bernardo994: nothing wrong systems but the amount and quality is my concern
[3:40:09] bizzybud: What would it say on your grave? " Played WoW really well " ? 🤔
[3:40:11] DreamWebb: i hear people say shadowlands isnt rewarding then people are complaining how good the PVP gear aquisition is or how they have multiple 226 toons its contradictory
[3:40:14] Calphurnious: You can have a class quest give your abilities a different look to them. Kinda like warlock green fire
[3:40:14] SeckSymbols: @ptz117 Doubt
[3:40:17] pinoculus: id like to just go back to maybe one lego item and tier sets no essence or conduit stuff
[3:40:19] manmower: 9.05 and we have systems like 8.3
[3:40:46] manmower: m+ gear needs to be made worse

[3:40:48] SeckSymbols: @manmower do tell
[3:41:02] Toasty_SW: anyone know what a good dps to play in tbc?
[3:41:09] Shrenko: @Towelliee problem with WoW is that they are adding all these system EVERY expansion that is relevant only that expansion and becomes useless or gone the expansion after. If you look at ESO or FF14 they implement systems that stays relevant for years later. You can say the same about zones, there is allways a reason to go back to a zone in ESO for example.
[3:41:10] rhodeos_: hunter or warlock
[3:41:13] FriendCat: raiding really doesnt feel rewarding at all
[3:41:13] Caibo1: hunter or warlock
[3:41:19] Brethren2K: I dont want the maw to touch me
[3:41:20] Nico_vdM: shaman or hunter or warlock
[3:41:29] sinlesssinner: see systems upon systems :)
[3:41:30] AsapXO: ohhhh maw touched items
[3:41:30] rhodeos_: shhh keep shamans as the sleeper pick
[3:41:33] fizzleblast127: BFA: Pvp rewards suck, go do pve for loot. Shadowlands: pve rewards suck, go do pvp. swing and a miss
[3:41:34] Kainiee: im still holding my heart for the new m+ seasonal affix
[3:41:37] AsapXO: how exciting
[3:41:37] manmower: tier bonuses would probably help raiding feel better
[3:41:40] Toasty_SW: hows fire  mage?
[3:41:40] Moobot: Check out Towelliee's latest Youtube video! https://youtu.be/U8-64zqVa8k Shadowlands needs some help
[3:41:45] falldrgn: Corruption 2.0.. jk
[3:41:59] Shrenko: housing for example
[3:42:02] RoboMaximillion: crafting
[3:42:02] manmower: golden saucer
[3:42:10] FriendCat: token based gearing
[3:42:11] remixonfire91: crafting
[3:42:13] belfastcl: @Shrenko it's almost like programmed obsolescene
[3:42:13] Calphurnious: crafting
[3:42:14] HeyitsMega: they dont, they just add new gear and tiers
[3:42:15] 4bmoney: LULW
[3:42:15] duffluv22: I like these chats.
[3:42:18] MrGattz: hahahahaha
[3:42:20] Shugaze: ERP
[3:42:21] raizanava: I just hope i can boost a bloodelf in pp
[3:42:23] V0lt4GE1: personally I feel like Blizzard cannot make anything good except raids/m+/pvp and everything they add is just to slow down people from playing that content
[3:42:24] Funteru: And still ppl are satisfied, prob thats the point
[3:42:26] MrGattz: hey housing was a great answer!
[3:42:28] Dirtnose: @Raizan_Avanon you cant
[3:42:28] Funteru: you dont need those fucking systems
[3:42:29] mr3machine: Wow crafting does suck
[3:42:30] manmower: chocobo racing battle royale
[3:42:36] remixonfire91: yes it is
[3:42:40] HeyitsMega: they dont use systems simillar to wow
[3:42:47] talantyr: It used to be a core aspect tho.
[3:42:49] SeckSymbols: @V0lt4GE1 No the problem is the playerbase is entitled into thinking they actually know what is best for the game. There is a give and take but players just wanna take
[3:42:49] HeyitsMega: their systems are side content, like UNREAL raids
[3:42:49] Thunderlops: Thunderlops converted from a Prime sub to a Tier 1 sub! 
[3:42:50] rhodeos_: it is in TBC #weaponsmithforlife
[3:42:51] burgerisee: Story way better
[3:42:53] GiraffeHydra_: sadly. I want good crafting so bad in wow
[3:42:59] LeonardLongNips: feel like crafting has died in WoW since like cata
[3:43:01] kaze171: Crafting in BFA was better
[3:43:04] remixonfire91: max lvl crafted gear on ffxiv ins 20 ilvl bh of raid gear
[3:43:06] cschwartzy: 11am New World Cinematic!
[3:43:08] Shapelessdnb: I feel like FF knows what it wants to be in comparison to WoW.
[3:43:08] cbiskit89: ffxiv stuff doesn't really carry forward because they have level and gear sync mechanisms to keep that content relevant so they instead focus on new iterations of things
[3:43:08] Finaldestinii: Finaldestinii subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 60 months! 
[3:43:11] AsapXO: someone just said they hope they can boost a blood elf....
[3:43:15] catlinv: Fetch quests
[3:43:17] manmower: final fantasy doesnt need systems
[3:43:17] AsapXO: this is the prob with blizzard
[3:43:17] KingofMeccano: but in ff14 they have a story around the crafting which makes it worth while
[3:43:22] FriendCat: @Towelliee they have a token based system for gearing
[3:43:24] smashwow: crafting is a job. that's not a system
[3:43:24] MuttonChopins: miney Kappa
[3:43:25] Bulgogiprince: The overall gameplay itself hasn't changed in FFXIV
[3:43:26] PvtHudson093: the class system in ff14 is better
[3:43:29] FriendCat: which i fine really nice
[3:43:29] Broomba: omg -- people are sooo ignorant -- story is not the system
[3:43:29] woomootv: The leveling of multiple chars on one character.
[3:43:30] MysticalOS: subscription growth, the most important system that carried from year to year :D
[3:43:31] raizanava: extreme trails
[3:43:32] neverbornlucky: final fantasy has furry cat girls wow doesn't
[3:43:36] DeanoTV: FF ResidentSleeper
[3:43:43] Vanishou: Te relic weapon system
[3:43:46] Toasty_SW: no we got foxes
[3:43:47] FluffehZ: All content are Relevant? rooThink
[3:43:48] tinydingaling_: SWTOR is lit
[3:43:49] MrGattz: fishing!
[3:43:49] manmower: they let the story, dungeons, and raids carry the game
[3:43:50] mr3machine: @neverbornlucky this guy gets it
[3:43:52] Brethren2K: in TBC will they ever be unlocking race change?
[3:43:55] woomootv: Leveling system
[3:43:56] smashwow: transmog is a system Kappa
[3:44:01] RoboMaximillion: oh the relics
[3:44:03] RyukiKay: I guess the relic weapon system that's present in every expansion that lets you get end-tier ilvl weapon
[3:44:03] manmower: 2.5 gcd
[3:44:09] RoboMaximillion: i forget about those lol
[3:44:10] Visevius: SWTOR on a new more responsive engine would be an amazing mmorpg :(
[3:44:13] CADZtv: ff14 players KEKW
[3:44:18] Bulgogiprince: They did add trusts
[3:44:20] tinydingaling_: True
[3:44:21] AsapXO: how about blizz throws a new mount into an old game if you pay them more money? would that be cool ???
[3:44:21] duffluv22: does FF have BORROWED POWER?
[3:44:25] sinlesssinner: The way i see Blizzard now is, their lore/raids&encounters team have complete freedom. But the systems and gearing team doesnt :)
[3:44:26] MuttonChopins: that would be hard to come up with a system that carries over
[3:44:32] luckfore: login system
[3:44:32] neverbornlucky: Wow needs a cat race
[3:44:34] Bulgogiprince: Doing dungeons solo with NPCS
[3:44:40] Xayte: Everquest had the alternate advancement points to enhance your character after max level. I imagine that would be sorely abused in WoW with aoe farming etc
[3:44:40] HeyitsMega: Relics/Eurwka
[3:44:42] manmower: i dont think final fantasy has ever had a stat crunch
[3:44:44] remixonfire91: @Towelliee  first stat squish next expac on FF
[3:44:44] KupoKoopri: You don’t need alts. Can play all jobs on one character.
[3:44:44] HeyitsMega: Eureka*
[3:44:45] woomootv: You have one character with many classes.
[3:44:45] CADZtv: final level is aźzzzzzzzzZ
[3:44:49] Stars_Eternall: only thing i could think of would be job quests they slightly changed it tho to job roll tho in the latest expan
[3:44:55] MrGattz: that would kinda be neat in wow..
[3:44:56] nightmayor12: FF14 is a movie with video game cut scenes
[3:44:58] mr3machine: haha so would i XD
[3:45:01] burgerisee: achievement system iguess
[3:45:02] 4bmoney: truuuu
[3:45:03] Brethren2K: SWTOR was great other than lack of content.
[3:45:04] JasperXtreme: agreed!!
[3:45:04] MetaKuron: I can't stand the levelling in FFXIV, and I have no idea why
[3:45:07] V0lt4GE1: @Secksymbols considering how covenants are, the conduit energy and torghast, I think we give more than take
[3:45:08] Havren13: The option to is better than no option to at least
[3:45:09] k_2lhu: I hated ff14s leveling system
[3:45:12] sinlesssinner: BOOTS!
[3:45:13] Fluisterwoud: D3 much
[3:45:14] MrGattz: you just wanna solo dungeons in wow and dont want to deal with pugs and idiots
[3:45:17] MrGattz: just invite npcs
[3:45:20] 4bmoney: diablo 3 did a decent job too
[3:45:22] Dracuhll: FFXIV keeps old raids and dungeons relevant for like daily items and relic weapons and stuff.
[3:45:23] Dirtnose: I miss that in SWTOR. It's all cosmetic now
[3:45:24] plate_of_food: companions got dumbed down in swtor
[3:45:25] GekkoHermit: its a shame Blizzard didnt try and copy the Guild Wars 2 mastery system, in that game old content is relevant thanks to that
[3:45:28] CADZtv: the final story ok nothing that special
[3:45:30] mmo_kenna_: ESO getting companion system like that next month
[3:45:30] Shrenko: Im just trying to say that Blizzard is adding all these systems every expansion that is so unbalanced they sorta fix it in the last patch every expansion, then after that we never get to see it again. it gets annoying
[3:45:35] pepedeeee: I want a relic IRL
[3:45:36] E_mark: The Materia system as survived from the beginning but that only effects people that go into savage stuff
[3:45:39] catlinv: Yep
[3:45:40] Strouss: @Xayte IT WAS ABUSED IN eq MORE THEN IT COULD BE IN WOW.....opps capsl lol  but you could multi box all night and get ass's
[3:45:41] Brethren2K: my Azshara companion was in full raid set and better geared than most of the dps on the server it was hilarious
[3:45:44] Fluisterwoud: ah yes that episode is great
[3:45:45] Vanishou: There is the relic weapon that is present in every expension

[3:54:46] simonbgg: 10-15 $ would be fine
[3:54:48] MickyFresc: $35 saves a ton of time versus leveling/gearing a new character to the same level though, so i mean...
[3:54:48] simonbgg: But 35, jesus christ
[3:54:49] SilkeySmooth: arnt they going to meet the servers anyway?

[3:55:22] Toasty_SW: when is prepatch so i can level bloodelf
[3:55:23] tat3potat3: it's $35 to clone a character with as much gold as you could of farmed these past 6months? a small fee to break the economy
[3:55:25] Wildside1177: @Calphurnious It is an existing script that they use to copy characters to the PTR.
[3:55:27] AsapXO: they always say play how you want but its gunna cost you 35$
[3:55:29] SonofHorus82: I'd rather just make a new toon that doesn't go into TBC and level in classic again.

[3:59:24] Wildside1177: far too expensive.
[3:59:24] verm1111: it doesnt even include shadowlands!
[3:59:25] Shrenko: shouldnt *
[3:59:25] balart: @Towelliee it's still too high, you are not paying for an expansion
[3:59:27] moshcraft: 40 for the pass, 15 for the month of game time, 15 for cosmetics
[3:59:28] simonbgg: Deluxe edition for a game that is 12 years old
[3:59:28] solsaver12: true
[3:59:30] Akermay: But thats because everything else included is already over priced
[3:59:31] dalaraz: nothing is overpriced if it is optional @Towelliee
[3:59:32] Ant9912: Technically its 30$ cause the boost is included and that already costs 40$
[3:59:34] Toasty_SW: yeah i understand
[3:59:36] luckfore: paying 70 while game is free LUL
[3:59:36] unholyhoit: what you added up there is overpriced individually too @Towelliee
[3:59:36] fears1988: its pricey tho bro
[3:59:37] Democritus33: but its a 15 year old game we are talking about @Towelliee
[3:59:39] iunbearable: over priced
[3:59:41] Rhikre: They've done so much market research. They know enough people are going to buy it that they'll still make a killing. They don't care about the community, it's all about the profit. Let me reiterate, THEY DO NOT CARE ABOUT THE PLAYERS AT ALL.
[3:59:43] TMMOOF: Optional is the only thing savign that price point, still wish it was less tho
[3:59:43] theoriginalzinng: for what you get its a value in comparison to what you would pay for separate items
[3:59:44] Shrenko: the mounts shouldnt be 25$ to start with LUL
[3:59:44] manmower: like buying canned air
[3:59:45] Shugaze: nuance people!
[3:59:46] Toasty_SW: but usually includes the actual expansion costs
[3:59:47] moshcraft: @Ant9912 it also includes a month of game time
[3:59:48] 770Cash: buying it forsure lol
[3:59:49] burgerisee: cheaper to by gold and get boosted
[3:59:49] LeonardLongNips: Thats bc the other stuff is overpriced
[3:59:49] balart: @Towelliee if you had to pay for the BC expansion yes, but it's still expensive lol
[3:59:49] bouv44: there's 30days sub and a boost
[3:59:50] Catspaw66: Copium squared !

[3:59:51] throwawaym3: Its optional why people so mad about it lol
[3:59:54] smashwow: services are still overpriced.
[3:59:56] StoicTaurus: boost+game time is more than $70
[3:59:56] death_fisted: them mounts are gonna be everywhere we will know who the suckers are
[3:59:57] fears1988: I'll damn well buy it probably, but damn its pricey
[4:00:02] heisenderp1337: lootboxes in fifa are optional too bro, we've gone far beyond that point already
[4:00:03] Funderik: sounds like he joined the trend rage.
[4:00:04] theoriginalzinng: figuring toys are 10-20 each, mounts are 25 and the boost is 40
[4:00:04] meijer32: isn't the boost cheap? @Towelliee
[4:00:05] Lincoln_WoW: the appeal of classic wow is playing a version without micro-transactions
[4:00:07] Eastwicksavag3: you cant say that when they make the prices themselves lol
[4:00:07] MFKnightS: i buying it
[4:00:08] Jokervenom1978: Im buying it lol
[4:00:09] thehypnotichippo: It is optional but Blizz dictates the prices that are already way to high
[4:00:10] AsapXO: if all the items seperatly cost way more then the bundle maybe its all overpriced garbage then??

[4:00:14] KizzyTwitchTv: LMFAO
[4:00:15] racketpunch: It’s overpriced. Those individual items are overpriced.  Wtf you smoking
[4:00:16] wendigodawn12: Haha
[4:00:17] scott_mch: $25 mount not overpriced LUL LUL LUL
[4:00:18] acklesdh: KEKW
[4:00:18] laceratedsky: LOL!!
[4:00:19] CADZtv: loooooooooooooooool
[4:00:19] Nico_vdM: If you subtract the boost and the game time you are left with 15 dollars for all the rest
[4:00:19] unholyhoit: I'd buy thet
[4:00:19] illuminationpaladincurse: gachi ?
[4:00:20] Fluisterwoud: LOL they will definitely make a shitton of money from this, thjey done their research

[4:00:59] VoxDeMorte: isnt it kinda weird that other deluxe edition upgrades are only 20 bucks but this one is 70? lol you get all the same things except a boost and time
[4:01:09] Nertok12: its wrong, it scales with riding skill and riding skill is 60
[4:01:09] Shugaze: oh thats better
[4:01:14] briefbreadfruit: yeah no shit, people overreacting as usual
[4:01:21] fears1988: isn't riding cheap now? like 20g but the mount costs 800g
[4:01:23] bouv44: the worse is that it's actually cheap compared to buying a mount, 30days and a boost in retail
[4:01:30] Funderik: that tie is offensive, not sorry
[4:01:32] Shugaze: so when I hit 60 with this mount itll be 100%?
[4:01:36] brarker: is it account bound or only on 1 character?
[4:01:37] fears1988: so if you get riding before prepatch, you save a lot of gold per character
[4:01:39] spyderman62: ofc you do

[4:03:26] Davcev: 1st one should of been free to keep both servers active
[4:03:27] Dracuhll: Sick ads.
[4:03:32] Xian359: wow 7 commercials
[4:03:40] solsaver12: why would I want Classic...I wanna progres my chars
[4:03:46] AsapXO: @themcfresh you can always say dont buy it but blizz only puts this in to make more money while not using that money to improving the game itself but lining the investors pockets

[4:03:58] Kolzko: ha I only got 6 ads
[4:03:59] Collected1: i dont understand his logic there. realms are running regardless.
[4:03:59] bouv44: yall are overreacting, I was expecting the boost only to be like 70$ lol
[4:04:01] hottschaseme: servers up
[4:04:01] Jzstyles: I expected it to be 20
[4:04:03] br0fest0r: nah with blizzars pricing i was counting on 25$

[4:05:12] Collected1: his "they need money for servers" argument is nonsense

[4:05:38] rhodeos_: the collectors edition is straight value for people who didnt have time for regular classic, saves u time for farming mount money, as well as time leveling. its pure value
[4:05:38] Zavier420: Servers are back up already
[4:05:45] Collected1: themcfresh : when were you last charged to start a character on a new realm?
[4:05:46] Nico_vdM: @Towelliee have you seen that review on a steam game where the guy played for 9000 hours and then said Not Recommended and played for another 9000 hours?

[4:06:33] MickyFresc: @Collected1 ??? you're limited in the number of characters you can have, if they were to increase that it would cost them more money to upkeep the servers for that
[4:06:42] DeeZeeGames: forgot about those loot codes
[4:06:42] corrosivecamden: but you get cards out of it lol
[4:06:54] throwawaym3: omg a company is selling products, so bad!

[4:07:01] Brethren2K: I love my TBC loot card Fishing Chair and still use it all the time
[4:07:03] MickyFresc: @asapxo I'm saying you're assuming that all they do with the money is "line investor pockets". I don't think that's entirely true
[4:07:09] Collected1: themcfresh : that makes zero sense.
[4:07:21] Collected1: themcfresh : no one is close to the character cap in classic

[4:08:47] domnero: servers up
[4:08:48] Collected1: themcfresh : the reality is our SUBS pay for the realms. Not a small fee for every character we decide to create on a new realm. The entire concept of New Character = Charge is purely a cash grab.
[4:08:50] Reddevc: Kreygasm BC nolife time
[4:08:50] sphynx_rayne: I will play and love it. if i buy or not buy anything
[4:08:50] nastymf_: The fuck is with the adds getting 7 adds ever 5 mins

[4:08:56] MickyFresc: @Collected1 dude I haven't even paid for server space myself and even I know it isn't free. I'm not saying each character someone has costs them more money, but they have a certain bandwidth for it and if every player was able to copy every one of their classic characters over, that could be an issue

[4:11:15] MickyFresc: @Collected1 fair enough my guy. you do you! think im done arguing about it. you can choose whether or not you want to buy it just like everyone else can
[4:11:16] Holysal: @MysticalOS that will be based on what server your on

[4:11:26] shookhunty: The transactions have no affect on game play. Almost everyone seriously playing TBC will ahead of anyone who boosts come on LULW
[4:11:30] Holysal: @MysticalOS you're
[4:11:31] Dracuhll: I already dont care about the prices. lol.

[4:11:34] sooziecuzie: If you want to be a purist, don’t buy the shit. Don’t worry about other people. If you can’t get over it, that’s on you.
[4:11:36] Collected1: themcfresh : yeah it's cool. I'm just surprised Tali made the argument that's all. It's all good.

[4:11:46] moshcraft: i will happily pay a $40 / month sub price if they take out mtx
[4:11:47] Mecabeast: real clout will go to the server first raven lords and ashes of alar
[4:11:48] VegiXTV: I dont give a crap about the micro transactions. I enjoy the game and I will pay for what I enjoy.
[4:11:53] Moobot: Check out Towelliee's latest Youtube video! https://youtu.be/U8-64zqVa8k Shadowlands needs some help
[4:11:54] sphynx_rayne: I just want to play I don't care about the mount and stuff it just goodies for people that want them
[4:12:00] lekkahdh: If I want to play TBC at 1st of june, should I start leveling my toon right now :O
[4:12:04] JmzKarma: i care about the prices but only because i want the deluxe and im broke atm
[4:12:05] gryn: No @Towelliee people are MAD because their favorite streamers are mad. fucking SHEEEEEEEEP
[4:12:06] K_A_N_J_I: Warp stalker mount funded by Doge Coin. Thank you very much

[4:12:29] TomCat: @capncolbeer but it's actually not
[4:12:32] stackopancakes: @Towelliee how long is the beta gonna be live? also do i have to have a character at lvl 60 to play tbc
[4:12:34] shookhunty: @lekkahdh i would say yes! Im leveling mine. It does take some time but i think there is a boost in exp gain in prepatch - not suree
[4:12:35] Funderik: just don't spend money, easy
[4:12:35] da_moosse: iv been playing wow for 10+ years, theres a ton of crap in the sho[ I havnt bought because I dont want it
[4:12:40] Kinghorn: the boycott is to NOT BUY THEM
[4:12:41] moshcraft: CDPR doesn't do mtx
[4:12:41] trivwik: We will pass it down to our kids and their kids
[4:12:43] Brodih_: Any big company is now investors > customer service
[4:12:47] xd_finsoup: just have Morales
[4:12:47] trivwik: Our achievement in life
[4:12:47] Kinghorn: dont buy a single mtx
[4:12:49] lekkahdh: @lekkahdh ty man!
[4:12:49] Moobot: Towelliee has not moved, he is renovating his streaming room over the next month or so. The stream will be scuffed, the audio will be different, but it will be worth it! Soon™
[4:12:52] lumaday: business model has evolved
[4:12:59] c_reddddd: Were gonna make less money!!
[4:13:01] themancunion: If you take in the age of player base £70 is a few beers and a meal. So if it’s what you find fun it’s not that much
[4:13:05] remixonfire91: @Towelliee  yes i agree with that but why does things on the wow shop cost so much ? you pat 25 euros for race changing in wow and in FF is 7 euros

[4:13:06] Rudric_Ice: Hood worth the money ?
[4:13:07] sooziecuzie: The character clone price is crap though
[4:13:07] RocketMan23: no mans sky is an exception to that
[4:13:09] AirmVn: Grinding Gear Games - Path Of Exile
[4:13:10] fantaaaa: gwent, so they do
[4:13:11] moshcraft: there's plans for a cyberpunk online
[4:13:11] Reddevc: CDPR hasn't gotten bought yet LUL
[4:13:12] Brodih_: i dont evolved is the correct word to be honest
[4:13:13] Shrenko: @Rudi_Ice nope
[4:13:20] c_reddddd: CDPR also release cp2077....
[4:13:26] RageerPLZ: I guess that means asmongold will eventually quit gaming and his stream will be about men going bald, thank god
[4:13:28] catlinv: CDPR ahs their own Heatstone
[4:13:31] honeychonker: I think its the price that angers people more than the fact it exists
[4:13:32] Kinghorn: hood milk?
[4:13:32] paravak: CDPR also release a giant pile of trash game and rob all of their customers up front, they dont need mtx lmao
[4:13:33] Lipon32: imma just buy the boost and get on with TBC
[4:13:33] Hank_ish: So it’s the death of gaming?
[4:13:35] xd_finsoup: cyberpunk 2077 left a scar
[4:13:36] Shrenko: new game on Steam
[4:13:39] DreamWebb: just dont play those games
[4:13:39] thrakan84: New Robin Hood game
[4:13:40] catlinv: Hood is a 4v4 PvEvP
[4:13:42] Dracuhll: Wait they said CDPR doesnt do mtxs? Didnt Witcher 3 have like 4 dlcs?
[4:13:46] Shuttlelol: hood is a PVEVP game
[4:13:47] DeleldurTV: Hood is a new pvp pve robin hood game that recently launched
[4:13:49] throwawaym3: All the MTX are optional and dont effect anyone elses gameplay, everyone getting trigger over it is a cucked af soyboy
[4:13:52] GrizlySword: Zynga and Mobile "ruined" gaming legit...
[4:13:53] wendigodawn12: They should reduce price of game services
[4:14:00] fantaaaa: yea gwent, you can buy pack or cards
[4:14:00] Word_the_Nerd: looks pretty good
[4:14:00] kofifrog: its janky as shit
[4:14:01] Shuttlelol: not really, its super early access still
[4:14:01] PvtHudson093: @Towelliee Like the classic stone mounts, i would like to be able to buy the Retail Warpstalker on it own.
[4:14:02] AsapXO: @RageerPLZ good one...
[4:14:03] justlnquisitive: It's like a 3rd person version of Hunt: Showdown, but worse.
[4:14:03] rhodeos_: ill be getting the collectors.. didnt have time for classic so a mount, lvl 58 boost is a pretty solid value
[4:14:04] Nico_vdM: TBH that $70 deluxe edition aint that bad, once you deduct the $40 dark portal pass and the $15 game time
[4:14:05] briefbreadfruit: bless you
[4:14:06] Shapelessdnb: bless you
[4:14:07] moshcraft: @orcnuts you're right, and gwent has mtx. fuck me
[4:14:08] catlinv: Early acces. Lots bugs. Kinda sorta rly unballanced
[4:14:09] Shrenko: its like very janky
[4:14:09] quju_: its pretty unbalanced =/
[4:14:10] Rudric_Ice: @Towelliee  Hood outlaws and legends
[4:14:11] nightmayor12: Bless you
[4:14:16] Shuttlelol: it has potential for sure
[4:14:17] ArcaneSyntax: @Towelliee you basically do a heist with robin hood characters.
[4:14:20] 91Niki: @Towelliee It's kinda like PVP islands in wow, but Robin Hood styled. Ish
[4:14:25] Poriand: 2 months damn
[4:14:30] MickyFresc: delayed 2 months? monkaS
[4:14:38] DeadlyDag: @Dracuhll DLCs and/or Expansions aren't mtx. Two different things.
[4:14:39] Shuttlelol: two days might be enough for mass effect 1 :D
[4:14:39] Anthy1887: ME is 3x 30hours LUL
[4:14:41] thrakan84: think Rainbow 6 Siege but Robin Hood
[4:14:41] kokochris: lol they delayed it again.
[4:14:42] Shrenko: its not early access
[4:14:47] fantaaaa: hood is not early access, its just shit LUL
[4:14:51] Valyou3: delayed again, they must want it to be ready for audience eyes
[4:14:52] Curtsy: Mass effect legendary edition doesnt have ME3 multiplayer PepeHands
[4:14:57] Shrenko: @catlinv its not EA
[4:15:02] luckfore: tbc delayed till july 9 too :D
[4:15:07] kokochris: they realized they were gonna get shit on
[4:15:07] Moobot: TBC is around the corner! If you would like to join our community guild in classic while we prepare, we are on Azuresong Horde! Send a request message in the #WoW-TBC channel in Towelliee's discord and a recruiter will be in touch! || Towel will be switching to Belf Pally on prepatch || No TBC Launch date or prepatch date yet.
[4:15:16] zerocemeriss: mass effect 1 will take 50-60h to complete if ur not rushing
[4:15:17] balart: @Towelliee cucked by the prepatch
[4:15:17] WoW_StandalonE: @Towelliee is the lv58 boost available on pre-patch?
[4:15:21] solsaver12: Thats smart
[4:15:22] Aravarth: I mean TBH that's smart
[4:15:24] Carahail: yes
[4:15:30] Mecabeast: the ashes delay was dissapointing
[4:15:32] Hank_ish: It’s not point you guys my friends and I could hours of gaming out smash bros for one price.
[4:15:34] tloh: its smart to delay cuz blizz tried to fuck them on the release date.
[4:15:35] mmo_kenna_: Mass effect remake looks like they did an awesome job
[4:15:39] kokochris: yup.
[4:15:42] moshcraft: does anyone know when classic char transfers will be open?
[4:15:42] Hank_ish: That’s what it’s about
[4:15:44] thrakan84: honestly I would like to be able to have more than 1 boost in TBC....
[4:16:00] Curtsy: @zerocemeriss 100%ing ME1 takes less than 50 hours lol, maybe yyou haven't played it in a while
[4:16:07] Poriand: oof
[4:16:08] kokochris: eso expansion June 1st and tbc.  rough time
[4:16:19] Rudric_Ice: you can't stream AOC right bcuz of NDA stuff ?
[4:16:20] thrakan84: I played original skipping side quests and it only took 10 hrs
[4:16:28] Poriand: eso expansion looks meh sadly
[4:16:48] balart: @Towelliee they dont want players to
[4:16:50] kironash_: there is the trailer of new world in 30min @Towelliee
[4:16:52] kerberw: Eso expasion june 1 LUL
[4:17:04] sifer007: cant wait for shadowlands to get out of beta LUL
[4:17:09] freshlife: wwwwww
[4:17:10] kokochris: @poriand it takes up part of the available player base.  so its not something you want to overlook
[4:17:21] Korupcija_: New World Pog
[4:17:22] Shuttlelol: new world could be a lot of fun
[4:17:23] mmo_kenna_: Companions will be good ESO, can gear them make them tank/healer etc
[4:17:23] JmzKarma: oh shit
[4:17:23] Mecabeast: it's hard to get a good release time in the mmo world huh
[4:17:32] JmzKarma: i didnt even know about this fuck yea
[4:17:32] Vanhoek: ESO is scrambling hard to keep their subs. Im shocked GW2 hasnt launched something since those two games are going to be the most effected by New World.
[4:17:44] Poriand: @kokochris i agree
[4:17:55] Shuttlelol: @Vanhoek GW2 has a new expansion in development though it might not be ready anytime soon
[4:17:55] Rudric_Ice: i hope New World is fun to play
[4:18:05] Brodih_: its all asthetics anyway
[4:18:11] JmzKarma: keen af for new world

[4:18:12] moshcraft: i don't have a problem with "deluxe" edition
[4:18:12] TMMOOF: I'd pay over 100 for a physical deluxe tbc
[4:18:14] Blynx: Vanilla and TBC had Collectors editions *shrug*
[4:18:14] PvtHudson093: @Towelliee I would like to be able to buy the retail warpstalker mount on its own
[4:18:17] moshcraft: i wish it was physical
[4:18:17] Curtsy: @Vanhoek on steam at least eso is as popular as it has ever been
[4:18:22] kokochris: @vanhoek nah bro they ain't struggling.  we don't know the numbers because you can launch directly from Bethesda launcher.  there is a lot of new players coming from shadow lands.
[4:18:23] Lamspread: I agree, but I feel that Deluxe edition should include something physical.... like an art book or something, but thats just me
[4:18:25] luckfore: its almost as much as shadowlands cost LUL
[4:18:28] Hank_ish: But that’s not what asmond is so pissed about I think he may pissed about a game we can just play
[4:18:30] Curtsy: @Vanhoek Has a solid daily player peak
[4:18:32] solsaver12: yup
[4:18:32] kofifrog: shadowlands boost costs 60£ in europe, thats like 6 hours of playtime
[4:18:35] sphynx_rayne: 20$ would be ok
[4:18:39] slowsuby: They don't want people to clone. That's why it's so expensive
[4:18:43] jeneraljelly: I really wanted to clone 2 of my char but at $35 fuck that
[4:18:43] DeadlyDag: @Lamspread Deluxe have never had physical stuff though.
[4:18:45] kofifrog: 1-58 is like 8 days
[4:18:46] balart: @Towelliee I'd agree if you had to pay for the expansion but the expansion is free. Make the calculation in comparison to other digital collector's editions
[4:18:52] solsaver12: exactly
[4:18:52] simonbgg: Is it only me that dosnt like that they actually include a new mount that can be used in TBC?
[4:18:52] honeychonker: Careful, you don't want to incite IRE
[4:18:53] lovecult85: "okay guys it is 3 POINT 5, we forgot it" :D
[4:18:54] Ruedew: If you have already bought BC in the past do you have to buy it again?
[4:18:55] moonscryer: @Vanhoek with the end of the ice brood saga, arena is all in for end of dragons later this year, maybe.
[4:18:58] moshcraft: $35 would be reasonable if it was for a whole account. but no way am i paying per character to move all my shit
[4:18:59] Rudric_Ice: Deluxe edition needs to have a statue or something then its worth it
[4:18:59] MuttonChopins: they are most likely trying to just kill classic
[4:19:01] peinen: It’s B for sure
[4:19:06] Razor9mm: My theory is Blizzard doesn't really want people playing Classic. It'll be extremely niche as it is and a bunch of people copying toons they'll never play would screw with server pop and make development more awkward
[4:19:07] roundishh: It might be a deterrent so they don't have to upkeep classic servers
[4:19:11] Collected1: Ruedew : it's free like classic. you just need a sub.
[4:19:11] SilkeySmooth: classic era servers are merging any way it's a waste to clo e
[4:19:13] Unlivedsam: I think they should have done 2 deluxe, one with just mounts and toys, and one with what is now, so if I just want the mounts I wouldn't be spending that much
[4:19:15] ginjakk: By naming it dark portal pass I’ve seen so many people think they need to pay to play tbc at all and are now not going to play it, such bad advertising to name it that
[4:19:17] Shallo1988: unfortunate
[4:19:19] Davcev: N OMEGALUL
[4:19:19] slowsuby: @Ruedew TBC Classic is free to play with just a sub
[4:19:21] bubbiTV: @Ruedew classic/tbc is free to play with a subscription
[4:19:22] Shugaze: who wants to pay 35$ and have to deal with low tier servers
[4:19:27] solsaver12: very true
[4:19:30] Brodih_: 90% of guilds will disband
[4:19:30] smashwow: it's 100% a deterrent. for the clone thing.
[4:19:30] jeneraljelly: cross serveer was my expectation for classic era servers tbh
[4:19:33] thrakan84: Are they not purposefully trying to make sure most people only copy if they are for sure going to continue Classic
[4:19:37] Blynx: You pay $0 and stay in classic on your raiding character
[4:19:37] Davcev: realictily maybe 5 of those 40 ppl can pay
[4:19:38] Lamspread: @DeadlyDag Yeah they've had "collectors" editions those, and thats what this feels like... again its just my personal opinion
[4:19:39] Shallo1988: but if youre BIS in classic why stay in classic
[4:19:43] sooziecuzie: Classic is going to be barren.
[4:19:50] Shuttlelol: i wonder if theyll ever do fresh classic servers
[4:19:53] Jzstyles: @towelliee the potentially true yet also tinfoil hat theory is they don't care how classic does cuz they can't monetize it as well
[4:19:57] Hank_ish: I don’t think that is the point here
[4:20:03] Tharia: I agree @ginjakk I had to read that twice to understand it's just the boost that costs money however you do it

[4:20:18] slowsuby: I bet they are trying to gauge accurate numbers for classic so they know how many servers to merge
[4:20:19] wrec7: i read that one of the main reasons people think they are keeping classic around is so they can keep the copy right laws in all countries
[4:20:21] JmzKarma: dude classic is gonna be dead apart from a few servers come tbc
[4:20:25] nightmayor12: tf does fresh mean
[4:20:26] Vanhoek: @moonscryer I  just know New World is very similar to GW2 with flavor. I don't think itll wet the WoW player or FF14. Only thing I can see making it so subs stay were they are is ESO/GW has history and a loyal following like WoW.
[4:20:27] Hank_ish: They just want the money
[4:20:31] Lamspread: think a classic + type thing would work? @Towelliee
[4:20:33] PvtHudson093: I just want to buy the retail warpstalker mount from the shop
[4:20:34] Davcev: OMEGALUL
[4:20:39] ColdChillXI: LUL
[4:20:39] Exusprime: WutFace
[4:20:42] Caff3inator: people just like to jam in their favorite expansion
[4:20:44] luckfore: TBC killed wow
[4:20:48] woomootv: Ive played wow since Vanilla, took a break a few months back and it's hard to come back. Sad to see a company destroy their own games.
[4:20:50] slowsuby: Vanilla Andys
[4:20:50] Xian359: Xian359 subscribed with Prime. 
[4:20:51] belfastcl: yeah some people just like vanilla and nothing else
[4:20:54] Blynx: classes being viable NotLikeThis
[4:20:54] Bernardo994: thats crazy WOW needs to evolve
[4:20:58] ThaOriginalGamester: i'm buying a classic transfer and boost. idgaf
[4:20:59] Xavorcs: more issues with things like justice/valor tokens
[4:21:00] MrGattz: because they are the definition of insane
[4:21:07] Shallo1988: they should do a seasonal thing in classic like POE
[4:21:09] MuttonChopins: I guess they like the memes
[4:21:09] Shugaze: vanilla pserver is kinda newish, tbc and wotlk were way more popular pservers
[4:21:13] Ruedew: Been there and done that, with BC it's just a cash grab, if you bought it in the past you should get it now for free.
[4:21:14] Hank_ish: They are boomer of Vanilla
[4:21:16] sternpickle: Dude, when I first played WoW as a kid during BC, my dad would of never spent this much money on me for WoW even though he had it. @Towelliee
[4:21:17] Curtsy: They have addiction issues and need professional help most likely yeah
[4:21:25] Davcev: i just dont get how ppl play classic for 15 years on retail and private servers and not getting bored
[4:21:25] solsaver12: I wonder why Omar left....
[4:21:26] NinjaGlovz: They'll wait till it dies off then launch "Fresh" servers
[4:21:29] Pufendorf99: Graphics was the downhill of games. Ohh, I remember the good old days with textbased games, those were real games
[4:21:30] Xithamas: for that money you can play 3 months and lvl a fresh character
[4:21:30] bubbiTV: 1 use of clonning should be added to the deluxe edition
[4:21:34] Innersane: TBC WILL NEVER DIE
[4:21:35] FranciscoTheMage: @Towelliee do people still play Classic EQ or Classic RIFT?
[4:21:35] WoW_StandalonE: vanilla private servers comeback
[4:21:44] Davcev: OMEGALUL
[4:21:44] Shineey: They'll probably need to eventually introduce some Vanilla Season servers, which reset every couple years or something
[4:21:47] Shuttlelol: no expansion comes close to feeling like a living and breathing world that vanilla offers
[4:21:51] jeneraljelly: N EW FRESH???
[4:21:51] br0fest0r: Depends if you can still make new classic characters or not
[4:21:52] slowsuby: F R E S H
[4:21:55] Phoecian: @Towelliee Scaling certain activities or players to old content (such as Raids/Dungeons) should have been the solution
[4:21:55] Moobot: Check out Towelliee's latest Youtube video! https://youtu.be/U8-64zqVa8k Shadowlands needs some help
[4:21:58] sujaktv: they shud do seasons in classic
[4:21:59] Shugaze: yep
[4:21:59] Aravarth: yup is fresh server resets
[4:22:03] woomootv: Gameplay Overrules all.
[4:22:03] Shallo1988: yeah
[4:22:08] Poriand: and then wrath hype
[4:22:11] FranciscoTheMage: SEASONS is not Classic..
[4:22:12] vimie: How is the clone service related to the fresh servers though?
[4:22:23] solsaver12: yup
[4:22:24] luckfore: i want legion classic now 😡
[4:22:28] Lamspread: i can see blizz pulling some "seasons" type shit where they have resets on the servers every so often
[4:22:29] woomootv: yeah so dumb
[4:22:31] balart: @Towelliee cant wait for wotlk classic
[4:22:34] Curtsy: @Shuttlelol This feeling depends on the person, Vanilla had no magic for me because I played a different game when it came out and had no nostalgia for it
[4:22:36] sifer007: we need to help bobby to get his new yacht LUL
[4:22:36] IzolepTV: just got beta still a lot of bugs :/
[4:22:37] Shallo1988: i kinda hope they dont make anything past tbc
[4:22:39] h_u_r_k_: @luckfore KEKW
[4:22:40] slowsuby: Wrath classic is going to be POG
[4:22:43] alanomeara: yes
[4:22:51] alanomeara: ligit
[4:22:52] FranciscoTheMage: @Towelliee the real reason they want to push people on to BC classic is because they see the cash cow that will be CLASSIC WRATH
[4:22:53] wrec7: its like the caves in silithus
[4:22:56] LeonardLongNips: They just did a massive beta invite wave and I still didnt get one...rip me

[4:23:26] jeneraljelly: I mean imagine P1 of wotlk classic..... shit version of naxx

[4:23:30] Xavorcs: it was the death of tanking
[4:23:33] rhodeos_: im just excited to do heroics

[4:23:35] Bajablastoislol: @Towelliee what are your top 3 expansions?
[4:23:36] Folkja: wrath is the definition of overrated
[4:23:42] TMMOOF: Wrath classic might be the thing to finally get me off retail
[4:23:44] thrakan84: Wrath is top but only because it finishes the Warcraft 3 story
[4:23:44] torridcheese3: DansGame
[4:23:46] dalaraz: it has ulduar,lets not scrap it :p
[4:23:48] Shrenko: lvling zones in Wrath is hot garbage
[4:23:50] MuttonChopins: you think people will realize wrath wasnt good in Wrath classic?

[4:24:06] Shuttlelol: did you like legion at launch or the first patch or both?
[4:24:06] balart: @Towelliee hopefully they'll develop a MoP classic server
[4:24:06] Hypn0tical: MoP is the best expansion they ever released. Story perspective. Raid perspective. Design. Art. Music. It only got a bad rap because HURR DURR KUNG FU PANDA Don't @ me
[4:24:07] moshcraft: wrath had some really good things and in other ways was the start of a change in the wrong direction
[4:24:08] DrakhanGaming: mop is #1
[4:24:08] luckfore: MOP Pog
[4:24:09] Tharia: agree MOP was awesome
[4:24:11] Rudric_Ice: NOT CATA ?
[4:24:13] Shuttlelol: did you like legion at launch or the final patch or both?
[4:24:14] xd_finsoup: MoP was trash for me
[4:24:15] kumah_1: people can only hate mop due to pandas
[4:24:15] Hank_ish: But can look at the facts that blizzard can’t be as as they once were.
[4:24:15] 770Cash: I hjust want wrath classic to sit at the dalaran bank steps
[4:24:16] MuttonChopins: I only like wrath cause it made ret pallys better
[4:24:17] WoW_StandalonE: shadowlands top 1 Kappa
[4:24:17] Lamspread: MoP was amazing
[4:24:17] Mynth0l: mop was good

[4:24:21] Innersane: MOP really ?
[4:24:21] Tharia: Legion raids are my favorites
[4:24:21] Caanan20: I loved Mists, I think Mists was underrated by everyone
[4:24:23] mmo_kenna_: killing LK with the squad was my peak of gaming
[4:24:25] wastedx3149: mop pvp was sexy
[4:24:28] Innersane: MOP was worst
[4:24:29] slowsuby: Streamline the raids
[4:24:29] DubakuMatumbo: MoP Numba juan Pepehand

[4:24:33] h_u_r_k_: mop KEKW
[4:24:33] slowsuby: Make them like retail
[4:24:34] Ruedew: @Towelliee Why couldn't they put a portal gate that takes your from classic to B.C. and back if you want?
[4:24:40] Mynth0l: Mop pvp the best
[4:24:44] PokerFaceMoose: so many wraith babies, that was their first expansion, first time playing. just like i love tbc because thats when i first played. hard not to look back with fondness
[4:24:45] Ken_z00: all my friends and guildies quit in wotlk sadge
[4:24:46] Tharia: once you got past jade garden mop got better
[4:24:47] thrakan84: that was only for Trials
[4:24:48] slowsuby: The timegating of ICC and heroic attempts were so dumb
[4:24:49] Aravarth: What I want is for them to keep the old token system from WotLK
[4:24:50] tophergtv: Do you only play classic?
[4:24:53] Aravarth: for purchasing gear
[4:24:56] Hank_ish: But can look at the facts that blizzard can’t be as as they once were.
[4:24:57] oraclespyro: wait u were  only have   50  attempts  per week?

[4:25:32] EthicalHermit: Now they will just level multiple toons
[4:25:35] sujaktv: that makes people sweat and have many geared alts
[4:25:37] MrKhanes: yeah that was for both Trial of crusader and ICC.
[4:25:38] Wheeellz: paragon couldnt do no nerf lk until they had lk gear
[4:25:42] Wheeellz: they admitted to it
[4:25:47] rhodeos_: but everyone gearing their alts made the casual experience amazing for wrath
[4:25:47] thrakan84: it didn't start until Trials of the Crusader
[4:25:52] bum0: algalon would ascend a few hours after you first started the fight
[4:25:54] DrakhanGaming: how much faster is leveling from 1-60 in pre patch? what level will most people get to in two weeks do you think
[4:26:03] Shuttlelol: when did they stop doing limited attempt bosses? In throne of thunder?
[4:26:04] rhodeos_: 20% faster
[4:26:24] Shuttlelol: ra'den had limited attempts
[4:26:24] Blynx: algalon was 1 hour right?

[4:26:42] thrakan84: I hate that fight
[4:26:45] duncon: :(
[4:26:48] Alaysian07: Ra'den had an attempt limit I believe
[4:26:49] balart: @Towelliee do you think they'll develop further wotlk classic?
[4:26:49] 91Niki: FeelsBadMan
[4:26:49] mr3machine: haha!
[4:26:51] Ken_z00: lol
[4:26:52] VoxDeMorte: :(

[4:27:03] sooziecuzie: Omg snapshotting feral bleeds
[4:27:07] Shineey: Paragon killed Heroic LK as soon as the 5% buff was implemented, so doubtful they would have killed him weak 1 even with unlimited attempts
[4:27:07] Thinkle_: @Towelliee I enjoyed feral in MoP, bleeds were super strong in PvP with treants
[4:27:09] Blynx: ra-den was a joke our first kill took 13 pulls

[4:29:18] Shrenko: do we know if they will add race changes and stuff to TBC @Towelliee ? wasnt that datamined awhile ago

[5:46:20] jerseyfive: drivers get outdated

[5:46:49] DrakhanGaming: I dont really need 4k gaming yet, im gaming in 2k atm

[7:56:32] cbiskit89: if i was a pitcher and the ump was behind me i'd use some stupid wind up to obscure their vision and make it hard
[7:56:40] Dirtnose: @Bulgogiprince That's more so cause of how poorly they use it. Tennis and Cricket both use computers to great effect
[7:56:51] Aravarth: lmao just noticed "boosted at bat"
[7:57:46] Dagomarus: Mmm i still think they could of done a better job at the character design for next gen, but maybe next year still a good game though
