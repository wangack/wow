[0:28:20] MBG_95: the MDI teams were saying with lust they kill this boss in 1 burn
[0:28:31] MBG_95: if they fail that burn its a big time loss right
[0:28:58] Sebleh: Wait the boss does a frontal or the big add?
[0:29:11] gustarferik: gustarferik subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 17 months!

[0:29:18] Kuroz: naguuraLove naguuraLove naguuraLove
[0:29:40] MBG_95: @Sebleh the add does, but obvs the stomp is also a frontal :P
[0:29:48] greatangelsanguinius: power couple
[0:29:59] MBG_95: its a very small frontal from the add
[0:30:02] devilyn_x: @greatangelsanguinius devily10Huh
[0:30:10] Sebleh: @MBG_95 yeah I was just confused by the "I didn't know it was a frontal" because the boss's is a VERY large and visible cone lol
[0:30:42] Fillern12: kushiPeepoStab
[0:31:30] MBG_95: very likely to grab trash from the other platform opposite spawn point too
[0:31:35] Sebleh: The feral is most likely a resto swap mid dungeon.
[0:31:39] Sebleh: IMO
[0:31:41] matt_xiv: is there a rule in MDI about not running a healer?
[0:31:48] Sebleh: @matt_xiv no there isn't
[0:31:54] MBG_95: @matt_xiv only rule is no spec stacking
[0:31:54] Sebleh: but there IS a rule against running out to swap specs

[0:37:50] goilen: They tank in the middle because they can still aim frontal out, but tanking in the middle gives easier access to the adds.

[0:48:25] MBG_95: the hex is only cast if you MC them
[0:48:33] MBG_95: it was an old spell that was removed
[0:48:38] MBG_95: from spell q
[0:48:39] Altariaz: @kuroz ty
[0:48:55] Sebleh: Yeah the hex is probably just a pre-M+ mechanic that got removed for keys
[0:49:21] MBG_95: @Sebleh it was in for PTR, it used to hex the tank (or a random person) and would just ez wipe the group :D
[0:50:18] Guarok: That bleed hurts
[0:51:10] sedgehammer1: Isn't he supposed to update the boom info online? I think it's like a teir behind.

[1:00:34] betterjunglealwayswins: Im pretty sure the portals slowly get opened by chromie and nozdormu
[1:02:13] MBG_95: the boss expands the floor that he is on, so if he is on an old fake puddle he just continues to expand that afaik
[1:02:34] Sebleh: no that’s just rp after you kill the specific portal mobs @betterjunglealwayswins
[1:03:21] Sebleh: it’s just massive damage ticks

[3:16:25] LtJenkins: @jlaw_89 Florence is great. Seeing the David up close really put into perspective what they were doing at that time. The museums there in general are on a different level
[3:17:11] jlaw_89: I bet , costs 2.2k for a plane ticket sadly. @LtJenkins

You probably ate bread once in like Florence where they specifically make unsalted bread and talked shit about the whole country when our bread and baking in general is ages above everyone else.

[6:07:56] MooniexVibes: o7
[6:08:04] Kuroz: hmmMeeting
[6:08:15] goblingher: next fortified week should be bolstering
[6:08:16] Sebleh: I was just gauging your price

[6:08:19] hackiii: yes
[6:08:20] Sebleh: I’m not doing it lmao
[6:08:20] MooniexVibes: what are we trying to convince her of?
[6:08:29] Sebleh: for that price point I’d rather buy myself emote slots
[6:08:30] BeardlessDwarff: The stromgly considering comment has me thinking you are backpedaling
[6:08:32] Flazzard_x: @Naguura I miss u so much
[6:08:46] hackiii: shes doin it
[6:08:48] hackiii: Pog
[6:09:04] MooniexVibes: what is she doing???
[6:09:05] Sebleh: and she’s only gonna get 50 subs out of it naguuraHypers
[6:09:12] hackiii: @Sebleh KEKW
[6:09:33] Sebleh: Naguura you ain’t getting shit from me on this yeah? naguuraSip
[6:10:05] flickrmbskull: you Finna get scammed
[6:10:25] Sebleh: She’s scamming herself because she is purposely ignoring that she’s not getting shit naguuraSip
[6:10:58] flickrmbskull: BibleThump BibleThump
[6:10:59] Noradria: @Naguura ask Annie, she knows a thing or 2 on transmog farms LUL
[6:11:00] hackiii: that part would be insane
[6:11:04] Kuroz: farming trasmogs is 100 % not getting lost while running around so
[6:11:05] Sebleh: start with the love rocket
[6:11:10] hackiii: first timing some content and getting all the 0.00001% mounts
[6:11:12] Kuroz: ofc you'll be bad at it
[6:11:16] MooniexVibes: Naguura will get so lost for sure
[6:11:19] StreamElements: For Highlights, fun content and guides, remember to subscribe to my youtube channel -> https://www.youtube.com/naguura
[6:11:32] MooniexVibes: can we get her to do the Lucid Nightmare?
[6:11:50] Sebleh: if I’m actually going to bet you 500 subs to do a full week of transmog content then we’re going to set some ground rules and goals otherwise you’re just gonna bullshit your way around slowly to kill time.
[6:12:51] Kuroz: seblehHmm  which ground rules can you set that don't make her auto lose the bet?
[6:12:53] MooniexVibes: the Lucid Nightmare puzzle was so frustrating for me lol
[6:13:27] Noxx_be: no coffees @Sebleh
[6:13:41] Noxx_be: the whole week
[6:13:47] Noxx_be: needs to do it sober
[6:13:50] Sebleh: @kuroz id have to figure them out Waiting
[6:14:25] MooniexVibes: the armory can give her a list of the once per week mounts I believe
[6:14:31] MooniexVibes: and a route
[6:14:44] Kuroz: I mean, you just set a limit of breaks she can take between transmogs and a 100 % cap on dungeon items she can spam all week and she lost @Sebleh
[6:14:53] Kuroz: seblehHmm
[6:15:17] hackiii: @Kuroz  LUL
[6:15:46] hackiii: no backpaddeling!
[6:15:53] Sebleh: I can absolutely backpedal now if I want to naguuraSip
[6:16:05] Sebleh: it’s twitch chat. I’m not bound by shit.
[6:16:31] Kuroz: you can't bait a conversation with chat for more than 10 minutes when you're bored for example
[6:16:32] MooniexVibes: I mean I have seen Naguura quest/do campaign content, so watching her do tmog farms would be hilarious
[6:16:36] Kuroz: Chatting
[6:16:38] hackiii: you should plan ahead tho
[6:16:41] hackiii: fanasiSusge

[6:18:42] domax92: all right all right
[6:19:10] Kuroz: you can basically drop her on a random mountain with a helicopter now and she'll find her way home with no tools
[6:19:18] Kuroz: she trained for it
[6:19:25] Kuroz: hmmMeeting
[6:20:13] Sebleh: “weak”

[6:20:26] Sebleh: honestly I just cba
[6:20:37] hackiii: Sadge
[6:20:52] Sebleh: it would be funny, maybe worth, but I’m too lazy to figure it out and I’m definitely not just gonna let you have your way with the rules

[6:21:50] Sebleh: she asked how we heat it tho
[6:21:57] Sebleh: the answer is air fryer naguuraSip
[6:22:07] Sebleh: oven is a good second choice
[6:22:16] Sebleh: just make sure it doesn’t get super dry I guess
[6:22:16] Kuroz: it's oven over microwave for sure
[6:22:26] Kuroz: hmmMeeting
[6:22:42] Sebleh: yeh because you want it to stay crispy and microwave will make it soggy and not heat up the chicken properly PepeLaugh

[6:27:51] Kuroz: you can downsize the bet and she makes it for a full day @Sebleh  so she has time for other variety stuff
[6:28:00] Kuroz: 8 hours of trasmog runs are still hard

[6:31:55] sim967: do you have a pan with wire rack that fits in it?
[6:32:15] Sebleh: I would imagine past Wednesday is probably a good day to say good bye to what’s left of it seblehNotes
[6:32:19] Kuroz: I'd throw it if it's still there on the third day
[6:32:39] heysafety: one of my daily meals is just ground turkey with apples on the side, its easy and one fo my favas

[6:35:31] Sebleh: @aero245 there’s an addon conflicting with it. I would suggest going to a character with no addons and making your changes there
[6:36:01] sim967: maybe you’re going through caffeine withdrawal
[6:36:35] aero245: @Sebleh i fully reseted the wow usr interface by deleting cache interface and wtf folders and have 0 addons and nothing works liek i said i can turn it off but then dont save so need to drag something to save so i do and it still shows up i have zero addons:(
