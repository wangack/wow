[3:47:12] MalachiteHotS: I LOVE GNOMEREGAN BatChest AN HOUR AND A HALF OF CLEARING TRASH BatChest
[3:47:12] LyteGod: Gnomeregan is actually pretty fun, big upgrade from BFD for sure
[3:47:18] niveous_a: RAGEY very unfriendly towards melee
[3:47:21] Qeevdo: Too much running around as ranged dps. Not parsing time
[3:47:22] bigwuzzy: Gnomer is fine! its a little harder so good
[3:47:22] Turbonerd_TV: it’s fine yea
[3:47:23] rustyjeep: this is like talking with Blizzard - they dont pay attention either :P
[3:47:24] Naboo69: savixOld ssir i just got here and you are talking about massive honkers
[3:47:27] Introp7: its not about the difficulty, i hate gnomer, dungeon or raid

[3:48:01] jb_eitht: FlowerCatJAM eGuitarTime
[3:48:12] ChuHatesYou: blizzard when people give feedback DonoWall
[3:48:18] Naboo69: savixOld killed thermaplug with no priest, 3 paladins and heavy melee comp, its doable but not very fun
[3:48:20] maniekloll: Would making blessing of freedom give a bit of speed + not dispellable enough? @Savix
[3:48:25] bionix1337: FlowerCatJAM eGuitarTime
[3:48:27] thatoneredguyoverthere: Gnomer as a raid is too reliant on needing enough range, otherwise a lot of fun
[3:48:28] jb_eitht: CAUGHT
[3:48:29] ArtyGray: i disagree
[3:48:31] casualfriendly: 20 man max!
[3:48:32] moonelfx: i hate 10 man raids
[3:48:33] nikola420tesla: 20 man would be cool
[3:48:34] niveous_a: @Naboo69 RetPaladin all the rets sliding to the buttons
[3:48:39] pwnmachine69: im not looking forward to 40man raids. wish they would leave it 10man
[3:48:39] ostring: 20-25 is nice
[3:48:40] monsieurnoodls: no one wants 40 lol
[3:48:40] Recknry: 40 is too many
[3:48:41] Qeevdo: true, we've had 10m dungeons since classic released
[3:48:44] ballhog___: raids are fun, fringe specs need love esp mana issues
[3:48:49] west__93: 20man would be nice
[3:48:49] jb_eitht: TRUEING
[3:48:51] monsieurnoodls: forming a 40 man raid is tough
[3:48:51] docxxd: 40 is aids
[3:48:51] Loginpage: 20-25
[3:48:53] shinra40: 10 works
[3:48:54] llnashiell: you've seen how many derp people are here, 40 is death lol
[3:48:54] Turbonerd_TV: @savix would even be nice if they make the 40
[3:48:58] Turbonerd_TV: to 10 man
[3:49:00] RudyRube: 20 feels epic 10 does not feel epic
[3:49:03] MalachiteHotS: 40 so boring i cant even find 25 to play with in wotlk LULW
[3:49:03] docxxd: 25 the most
[3:49:04] SanMuki: best value is 20
[3:49:11] jb_eitht: 40 is such a pain KEKL
[3:49:14] PaEu: thre should be one level 40 raid but i agree otherwise
[3:49:15] docxxd: ^
[3:49:16] capt_bagel: 20 is the best value i agree
[3:49:16] moonelfx: 40 is the best, actually only game taht has it
[3:49:16] pwnmachine69: 10man for the rest of sod would be best imo
[3:49:16] Introp7: 20 would be nice, would allow more comp diversity
[3:49:18] Qeevdo: With 40 you need much fewer tanks. So probably easier for dps
[3:49:19] bliz0th: I think they should implement 15 - 25 mans. But I don't play so xddShrug
[3:49:22] weegey: True and real
[3:49:27] forwardslashhugtv: 40 is fun for open world shit but trying to do progression is awful with 40
[3:49:28] Naboo69: @niveous_a all the rets were pumping boss and rotating freedom on ice phase, warlock and boomkin did buttons
[3:49:31] monsieurnoodls: that kills the game for me frfr
[3:49:33] girlz__: youre telling me if MC was out today, people couldnt fill 40mans? thats essentially what classic was lol
[3:49:33] jb_eitht: heheChatting heheChatting heheChatting heheChatting heheChatting heheChatting
[3:49:35] RudyRube: @Savix add new 20 mans and leave all the old 40 mans.  Then one FINAL 40 man at the end of SOD
[3:49:39] SanMuki: HELLNAW
[3:49:39] tw1ZTER: HELLNAW
[3:49:41] Recknry: 10 or 20-25, I agree even 25 is too many imo
[3:49:45] jb_eitht: heheChatting NEED HEALER
[3:49:51] niveous_a: @Naboo69 Cryge i wish our comp had more paladins for aura's/freedom
[3:49:55] RudyRube: @Savix yeah i mean for 60 content
[3:49:57] esbi__: 17 would be BiS
[3:49:58] xirva: 10 is nice
[3:50:08] Madwo: duh
[3:50:11] tw1ZTER: 17
[3:50:11] echoloch: who dare disturbs my meditation
[3:50:14] Madwo: :d
[3:50:15] PaEu: they should have one 40 man raid at 60 though just for the classic vibes, but not all of them
[3:50:19] LVZVRVS: with only 10-20 mans they need to make some buffs raid wide

[3:51:12] Alis_yazuki: Bro savix some ppl Cannot press a button om
[3:51:14] niveous_a: BFD was waaay too easy
[3:51:16] jb_eitht: huh hard?
[3:51:17] SanMuki: om
[3:51:19] ThisisSnow: its not the difficulty, its the amount of multi tasking is not typical for classic
[3:51:19] ostring: om
[3:51:19] Cjpriest: its not even that hard though
[3:51:20] luke12300: AT YOUR SIDE MLADY
[3:51:29] positive_ions: Us dads are still level 36 on main
[3:51:31] Reck179: FACTS
[3:51:35] ChuHatesYou: @Comixs idiot
[3:51:36] thatoneredguyoverthere: I think 6th boss has too many mechanics attached to it, fine if hard but not so much juggling for Classic.
[3:51:41] kanosuntale: I think gnomer difficulty is pretty good, best gear in the phase doesnt have to be free - and first 4 bosses are pretty free already
[3:51:42] forwardslashhugtv: he is right... the last boss sure but all of em?
[3:51:52] shinra40: im not asking for mythic levels of shit at best heroic
[3:51:54] weegey: It's not bad with the right comp....but as a 10 man it's harder to just play what you want with friends
[3:52:05] Alis_yazuki: I get 1 shot by shamans Cryge
[3:52:07] ThisisSnow: its not the difficulty, its that classic is typically simplistic and the super mech and menagerie feels like too much going on at once
[3:52:08] monsieurnoodls: PVP is TOO bursty; more time to kill IMO
[3:52:11] Cryptoji_Jojoji: 60 pvp always turned into a burst fiesta LULW
[3:52:18] Naboo69: savixOld people think dont stand in bad, press kick, use dispel, maybe taunt are actual hard mechanics? keking
[3:52:25] ThisisSnow: you can have simplistic stuff thats also hard
[3:52:28] jonesyss8: chase them around for 10min
[3:52:28] youngfuz: Can't kill
[3:52:29] positive_ions: STV event and one shotting seems they want it arcade style
[3:52:30] jb_eitht: KEK
[3:52:36] thebigdongerhere: U cant but i can
[3:52:36] Cronon17: slow paced damage/burst is sooo boring imo.
[3:52:36] lord_windir: KEK
[3:52:43] kanosuntale: man I hate this pot noodles ad
[3:53:00] gbish00: gbish00 subscribed at Tier 1. 
[3:53:07] casualfriendly: I kinda dislike this burst damage.
[3:53:09] tw1ZTER: make healers great again
[3:53:14] ThisisSnow: the pvp is a little too fast on ttk right now but its good if every classic class can 4-5 shot people imo

[3:53:46] ThisisSnow: you need to be able to fight back / respond to rogue and warrior
[3:53:52] bliz0th: CHILLS
[3:54:03] Naboo69: savixOld big number = dopamine
[3:54:11] loonz99: good evening Savix
[3:54:13] esbi__: Always has been yeah
[3:54:14] SanMuki: ye always been
[3:54:17] casualfriendly: yes but there was this, windfury has to proc at least. now, u jsut have to push the button and BAM
[3:54:18] kanosuntale: I think next phase they should give class some defensive cooldowns (like frostbound fort or shamanistic rage, or retail divine prot)
[3:54:21] PaEu: fast pvp is better than slow
[3:54:26] thatoneredguyoverthere: I think it would be better if everyone could burst
[3:54:28] cryptomeganinja: !GEAR
[3:54:35] girlz__: yeah fast is better than slow
[3:54:43] fridxa: Just give everyone divine shield
[3:54:44] tw1ZTER: AMBASING im about to bus
[3:54:44] Arzondir: Thinkge
[3:54:45] ThisisSnow: you can still have fast TTK, just not literal 1 and 2 shot, we want like a 4-6 global window
[3:54:46] niveous_a: i don't pvp so Shruge
[3:54:49] Tehghost66512: i wish there was a bit more pvp gear awards
[3:54:49] Cryptoji_Jojoji: I think you're never goign to balance PVP
[3:54:54] SanMuki: @PaEu yep fast pvp with skill involved ofc not just oneshots
[3:54:57] PaEu: I think PvP is good, and they should add arenas next phase to see if it would fit in SoD.
[3:54:58] Cryptoji_Jojoji: balance pvp in classic rather**
[3:54:58] positive_ions: Blizz likes arcade style, they're pushing it harder for phase 2
[3:55:03] kanosuntale: defensive skills in phase 3 like icebound fort, divine prot or shamanstic rage)
[3:55:05] bliz0th: I think you should play more variety Lurkin
[3:55:07] kanosuntale: would create counterplay
[3:55:10] bliz0th: honest opinion
[3:55:15] esbi__: I love solo lurking on my rogue in STV
[3:55:16] ChuHatesYou: catJAM
[3:55:17] LVZVRVS: slower pvp gives counterplay potential
[3:55:19] FeralTami: Lurkin
[3:55:25] josephromeolouis: I haven't played wow in 10 years u think it's worth playing again?
[3:55:25] ThisisSnow: everything being imbalanced will always be more fun
[3:55:25] foggdoggg: Yea warrior can one tap after 5 globals
[3:55:29] fridxa: Just add resilience om
[3:55:30] ostring: too balanced = boring and flat
[3:55:33] ThisisSnow: everything feeeling op feels the best
[3:55:34] parisace: I think asmon is best warrior he was R1 so many times real gladiator jokrdSid
[3:55:34] bliz0th: welcome back @FeralTami Lurkin
[3:55:34] Naboo69: savixOld I like fast, but melee hunter W key at plate class and raptor strike them to death in 2 global is retarded
[3:55:39] esbi__: @fridxa HELLNAW
[3:55:40] jonesyss8: i used to smoke nonwarlock clothies as a rogue in pvp in vanilla
[3:55:47] FeralTami: @bliz0th thank you sir Lurkin
[3:55:51] Biohazzard567: theyre ignoring warrior
[3:55:53] Biohazzard567: outright
[3:55:55] Arzondir: wrrr
[3:55:56] hellscream_199: @Savix we need oneshot button for ret, maby Divine Toll
[3:55:59] bliz0th: wrrr
[3:56:00] FeralTami: @Arzondir wrrr
[3:56:04] listrel1: wrrr
[3:56:05] kanosuntale: @Savix what do you think of defensive cooldowns being added for most classes in p3 as counterplay to burst?
[3:56:06] Arzondir: @FeralTami wrrr
[3:56:10] morticianbuera: LOL
[3:56:14] morticianbuera: asmon is trash
[3:56:14] Cjpriest: he has good takes on the whole game
[3:56:15] Biohazzard567: Best warrior is Dekar for sure
[3:56:16] chickenbaggins: wrrr

[3:56:20] parisace: Asmon get rank 1 many times I see achievment payoBabyRage
[3:56:27] koutsoubelove: @Savix what do you think about shockadin?
[3:56:42] Biohazzard567: It's good unless you play warrior
[3:56:43] applefrit: Asmon to his credit is a really good PvE warrior
[3:56:43] wreckstormx: i heckin loove wow
[3:56:45] Biohazzard567: then its fucking miserable
[3:56:46] casualfriendly: 8/10
[3:56:48] fridxa: 0/10
[3:56:50] Saadonis: 8/10
[3:56:51] PaEu: SoD pvp is great and i think they should try and add arenas for next phase to see if it would fit
[3:56:51] SatedSMOrcaBabies: Templars verdict
[3:56:52] SanMuki: pvp is improving each week so they trying atleast
[3:56:52] esbi__: I love it, better bursty then slow
[3:56:53] ostring: best warrior ever = Anticide Stronge
[3:56:55] djmsqrvve: I like BGs a lot, Event sucks.
[3:56:57] foggdoggg: too bursty, 0/10 for warrior game play lol
[3:56:58] Recknry: proof in the fact they're doing their best to listen and balance
[3:57:02] thatoneredguyoverthere: Just make Judgement a 1 shot 1 kill with SoJ Kappa
[3:57:03] shinra40: depends on what class your talking to
[3:57:03] ChuHatesYou: PvP scares me peepoSitti
[3:57:05] girlz__: pvp overall is good right now, besides a few classes being kinda busted, SP/ele sham
[3:57:07] LyteGod: 6
[3:57:07] parisace: I rate it 3/10 got 1 shot on my mage and quit jokrdChads
[3:57:08] rustyjeep: 6 for the 1st day...rapidly drops to 2
[3:57:31] Naboo69: savixOld I like fast, but melee hunter W key at plate class and raptor strike them to death in 2-3 global is retarded
[3:57:32] Arzondir: woah
[3:57:44] Alis_yazuki: @Arzondir hello ♥ arzondL
[3:57:46] nevoa23: SOD is basically becoming a retail wrapper for classic
[3:57:49] hellscream_199: 8/10 priest, boomkin, rogue, hunter 5/10-paladin somthing like this
[3:57:50] niveous_a: @Naboo69 frfr

[3:58:04] listrel1: I blinked and you lost 75% of your hp
[3:58:08] parisace: i am nearly done with P2 so now this is just waiting room simulator.
[3:58:12] tw1ZTER: AMBASING MAKE THINGS RIIIIGHT
[3:58:14] applefrit: zerging pvp mitigates class imbalance imo
[3:58:20] positive_ions: Most people say they want balance, but when they rate the pvp high, it's when they're main is at least a little OP
[3:58:34] wreckstormx: Kapp
[3:58:40] ChuHatesYou: catJAM DrumTime
[3:58:43] Saadonis: Bro P2 cant stay to long else people will leave
[3:58:45] babawes: gearing in raid seems really fast tbh
[3:58:53] Saadonis: Me 2 exalted in both
[3:58:57] Recknry: you can probably guess with relative accuracy what class people play based on their votes lol
[3:59:02] koutsoubelove: @Savix what do you think about shockadin?
[3:59:06] Biohazzard567: P2 needs to be out for at least 3 months
[3:59:06] Naboo69: @niveous_a I can be in bear form with survival instincts up and melee hunter still clap my cheeks, don't even have to get lucky crits its so fried
[3:59:06] parisace: Not yet but but both my mage and rogue are nearly geared out so just raid log mainly
[3:59:06] handpickedbytim: hello mr savix, it appears you have a handicap icon and ret in the same title, seems fitting Ok
[3:59:10] bliz0th: HmmNotes
[3:59:11] Biohazzard567: only 10% players are level 40
[3:59:12] maniekloll: done with p2? isn't the point to actually enjoy pve and pvp? xd
[3:59:12] Saadonis: Yeah but i heard that P2 should stay till may or so
[3:59:15] fridxa: Nice penis drawing bro
[3:59:15] hellscream_199: @Savix btw this is not classic wow its SOD so this is diffrent game
[3:59:18] niveous_a: @Naboo69 if they crit its just over
[3:59:18] Kickapooh: i've never been a big fan of pvp and i feel like they are trying to lock stuff behind doing the world pvp event so it kinda ruins the fun i have in wow
[3:59:19] maniekloll: not just do it and get over with
[3:59:31] SynthAttackTM: phase 2 came 1month too late, lost all the hype, me too

[3:59:54] wreckstormx: same
[3:59:55] Naboo69: @niveous_a giving hunter basically mutilate with swords very poggers blizzard keking
[3:59:55] casualfriendly: SURE! Era is shit compared to SoD
[3:59:56] Biohazzard567: only 10% of players staistically are level 40
[3:59:57] Cjpriest: the people already complaining about p2 being boring are stupid
[3:59:58] morticianbuera: SOD is better version of classic
[3:59:59] parisace: me too SOD is BIS just not much to do now
[4:00:00] SanMuki: and i hate that people just complain 24/7 instead of enjoying it
[4:00:04] jb_eitht: NODDERS

[4:00:20] ostring: HOLY om
[4:00:22] listrel1: You'd be wearing a dress
[4:00:23] SynthAttackTM: classic was harder and it was good
[4:00:23] PaEu: SoD is great I think.. and people forget its not all about phase 2 or 1, imagine how it will be at 60. im excited for it
[4:00:25] Saadonis: How long should P2 stay your opinion Savix
[4:00:32] bliz0th: I don't really have that much experience from SoD. But I too would argue that SoD is better than classic HmmNotes
[4:00:40] shlyq1: i keep getting ganked by ret paladins in stv as a rogue
[4:00:44] SanMuki: classic? hard? om

[4:00:57] tw1ZTER: nah id win
[4:00:59] SynthAttackTM: leveling is too easy in SOD now
[4:00:59] Cpt_Titus: game mechanics were never hard
[4:01:00] kinkyspatula: classic has it's charm, i understand people wanting fresh. but i think it would be good to see how Sod plays out at 60
[4:01:00] wreckstormx: im hard
[4:01:01] Naboo69: Era ret pov: savixOld SwordTime get back here let me do my auto attack combo
