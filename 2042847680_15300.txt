[5:40:46] Binnsey: it's a good karthus item it can apply to all 5 people at once and do like 5x damage if they stack together

[6:51:26] Nightbot: Sneaky wants to make a dumb play, but he doesn't want to be criticized for it. An idea pops into his scheming mind. He asks, "chat, what do I do?" Now all he has to do is wait. He sifts through the hundreds of comments all asking for the highest play, but there it is - an alibi. A single 3head commenter in chat asking for the same dumb play sneaky wanted to do in the first place. The play fails spectacularly. Sneaky smirks to himself and sighs, "That's the last time I listen to chat."
