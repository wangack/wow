[1:15:44] nowheretoday: It's like physical trauma never back to original
[1:15:52] RUNAAA1: @SONII Yes. 1st u need to heal yourself ( at some point ) , u cant fully do it. Then u need to find a good girl that you love that helps you to heal the wound. Then u are fully healed. if she do not betray you xdd
[1:15:52] madmanmayer: getting a real one, is the ultimate goal. I got mine and wish that for everyone I know

[2:31:54] ZexanGG: we out chyere
[2:31:58] candlecan: unfortunately feral is ass this phase. next phase they should be better

[2:33:44] ZexanGG: i dont think we (feral) is ass this phase, i just think we're a lil'-bit-a-lot gear dependent.
[2:33:52] candlecan: furor is rage and energy on shape shift. heart of the wild is insane stat buff
[2:34:04] Nightbot: Want to Subscribe for FREE?! Connect your twitch to your (or parent's) amazon prime account  soniiLewd https://twitch.amazon.com/prime
[2:34:20] candlecan: super gear dependent, they will get better later in the phase with gear but thats probably just for raid parses
[2:34:34] aspectoflion: insane dam
[2:34:50] ZexanGG: right - i got mine - but you need it

[2:40:56] 94explorer: at least its not as laggy anymore fr
[2:41:24] candlecan: they should have punished groups over 3 ppl
[2:41:31] Laaun123: the dmg is still way too high and you die to quick overall
[2:41:48] nitrodubs_: just reduce it
[2:41:55] xbento: you need resil
[2:41:55] GregWasTaken: lol
[2:41:56] st0neh: Holy shit I don't watch for a day and @SONII is grey and balding
[2:42:14] Tyfonius: by the time they'd have tuned for STV we'll be in phase 3 with a new pvp event
[2:42:23] pmanfit91: I think they're having a hard time controlling the damage of specific runes, outside of that.. they're just gonna increase health until we're 60
[2:42:24] aspectoflion: @xbento fr
[2:42:25] Selecktt: I would say a pvp damage reduction modifier. But that just hurts warriors even more because no rage lmao
[2:42:25] limburgse: what is that "tring" sometimes?
[2:42:31] Fluvluv: pvp set with resil for bgs and bloodmoon event
[2:42:42] candlecan: just keep pumping stam for everyone in the event until it doesnt feel bad
[2:42:50] xbento: I'm kidding boys, resil helped to kill the game
[2:42:52] candlecan: seems like that should be good enough
[2:42:53] teadanman: Yooo! Nice haircut
[2:43:01] xbento: all the "bandaid" fixes instead of actual tuning
[2:43:17] spionballa07: It's been hit and miss for me . Feel i have died 3 times sometimes and other times 300 ...
[2:43:52] Ypsirc17: u just slammed me

[2:46:22] GeoSazn: YOO NEW HAIRCUT ?
[2:46:45] g_1_t: 10000%
[2:46:49] FIREMAGZZ: true half the pop is DED
[2:46:51] Selecktt: Well yeah, p1 was the hot new shit
[2:46:52] Laaun123: whats your assessment of warrior in p2. I feel its a bit better but compared to other classes, warrior still got cucked.
[2:46:52] shloom995: the hype died fast
[2:46:57] ScaredMoneyWontMakeMoney: harder to get into
[2:46:58] itstenaciouswow: 60 will be the next hype wave for sure
[2:46:58] Tyfonius: the "new" is gone yeah
[2:47:04] okVes: p2 pvp was all one shots
[2:47:04] Korvynah: You know... banging a new gf is pretty hype at first... and then its not.... so

[2:47:14] shloom995: 60
[2:47:16] Playonwordz: i think they just waited to long to release next phase
[2:47:17] NericoTV: stv every 3 hrs and then 45 min of raid per 3 days
[2:47:20] FIREMAGZZ: the POWER CREEP is gonna set in
[2:47:23] itstenaciouswow: 60 I think alot of people will come back
[2:47:25] itstenaciouswow: or a good chunk
[2:47:26] NericoTV: all there is to do rly
[2:47:30] candlecan: just runes and 1 raid isn't super satsisfying over long time periods
[2:47:35] candlecan: also phases are too long
[2:47:41] FIREMAGZZ: the power creep is gonna GATE KEEP people from playing
[2:47:43] bruhy04: i mean the beginning of phase 2 was pretty lit. but quickly slowed down
[2:47:45] Indomitablez: @SONII can you link this playlist
[2:47:46] tommygunz31: were getting bladestorm next phase!
[2:47:48] jlund91: don't think there will be a new hype phase unless there's a phase with raid content meant to be post naxx
[2:47:51] SONII: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZMWKqbcwzo
[2:47:52] Korvynah: Anyone who says the only thing to do is stv and raid log is not playing the game properly LOL

[2:47:57] Indomitablez: ty bro

[3:46:05] iPlayCuzFun: haha yeah
[3:46:07] fezsmash: bladestorm would be cool for warriors and i could support the idea of warriors getting a stun. but making more like throw down i think. make then use there gap closer. Also give warriors an ignore pain feature similiar to retail. but thinking about the idea instead of rage cost maybe cost hp. and make it actually really good or replaces blood rage and give dmg immunity for 10 seconds and rage
[3:46:19] TheW0NT0N: 2 day split? u gotta workout plan or anything? not tryna glaze but i'm tryna get delts like that ma boi

[3:50:29] theelder1312: they should reduce the armor of bosses in gnomer...and maybe give warriors a heroic leap or we something or something new that was never used before..so they feel more fresh
[3:50:34] therealthracian: @Deatharmor98 well i agree

[4:52:42] Gutstv213: cluck hits hard if you dont kick squirrel
[4:52:54] iPlayCuzFun: @Ranzorx its not too hard at all
[4:53:05] Wooshu: the priest was nearly oom before you had them to 75% life
[4:53:05] WcWillow: i was able to tank all 3 as shammy last gnomer
[4:53:10] st0neh: Gnomer isn't that hard, it just requires everyone to know what they're doing unlike BFD lol
[4:53:13] iPlayCuzFun: just stay in D stance and spam sunder + shield block ma
[4:53:13] Zerocrunk94: @Ranzorx its not hard
[4:53:17] WARRIORPOWER: sony what do you take/do for your hair to stop the Vegeta hairline?
[4:53:32] st0neh: In BFD half your raid could be off in Narnia
[4:53:53] jschroe3: yeah shovel that chicken in there
[4:53:59] danmand00d: its genetics bro his cards were aces @WARRIORPOWER
[4:54:05] Ranzorx: "its not hard" watching good players literally wipe over and over
[4:54:07] narffius: i just solo tanked it pugging on shaman. 2 and a half healed it with a mage swapping rune. your group's dps is going to be so low with 3 tanks
[4:54:12] Ranzorx: I think yall are underestimating it
[4:54:14] st0neh: Next pull just eat the chicken @SONII GG mechanics
[4:54:18] backsideRodeo: @jschroe3 shovel LOL

[4:54:31] Wooshu: @Ranzorx I watched Desiheat with randoms clear it in 2 takes
[4:54:55] kyidentity: chicken does the most
[4:54:56] Ranzorx: @Wooshu I cleared it with randoms last week, its till not easy yet
[4:55:07] Manimon_: we do it with 2 tanks
[4:55:15] 5thD5thD: tbh the 3 times my raids have done this boss we sorta just grouped up the 3 and dps'd them all down together with ranged on sheep, just dodging the fire breath an ignoring the rest
[4:55:19] Wooshu: its easier than Mechnoplug
[4:55:25] st0neh: @Ranzorx I cleared it with a pug last night and one of the healers didn't even have full healing gear lol
[4:55:36] B_Rize: devastate rune spam sunder big dam
[4:55:38] BlownFuse_: I tank chicken and squirell on my lock and then off tank takes dragon
[4:55:42] BlownFuse_: and we all get railed
[4:55:55] Wooshu: the sheep has a deflect mechanic.. just gotta watch it
[4:55:59] shawdonda: ive done off tank on chicken
[4:56:00] Nooshbag98: our ot took the chicken last night
[4:56:01] iPlayCuzFun: main tank usuallly goes chiicken since he hits harder than drag and squir together
[4:56:35] Ranzorx: @st0neh nobody has full healing gear lol
[4:56:47] limburgse: you should drink milk
[4:56:50] 5thD5thD: build up to it

[4:56:56] Jaycee_lad: pussy

[4:56:58] Wooshu: have you ever watched the show Hot Ones?
[4:57:02] BlownFuse_: never understood why people like spicy food
[4:57:07] barskebaard: breastmilk helps
[4:57:26] sand_pump: ?????
[4:57:28] OGTigolebitties: ya nothin wrong with a lil breast milk

[4:57:38] chilemangx: i have a sauce and everytime i use it i instantly regret is its good for like 3 seconds lmao
[4:57:42] iPlayCuzFun: lmao if u are weak there is "no flavor" other than spice
[4:57:48] KairuruTV: it only seemsl ike there is no flavor if you are sensitive to spice because its overpowering to you where to someone else it is very subtle
[4:57:49] jessse: whats a day of eating look like for you sonii
[4:57:50] JVegas: my body doesn’t agree with spicy anymore it never use to bother me
[4:57:51] Tyfonius: if you dont taste it it's either too much or the sauce is ass
[4:57:58] iPlayCuzFun: if you love spicy there are loads of flavor
[4:58:05] R_GraM_: I like regular hot sauce 0 calorie condiment
[4:58:17] barskebaard: habanero is hot for me
[4:58:21] B_Rize: Haberno is hot af lmao
[4:58:24] Tyfonius: we don't have that here unfortunately
[4:58:25] kangming1: if you're having trouble with how hard they're hitting you can spread them all apart
[4:58:27] st0neh: How come every time I watch @SONII chat turns to breast milk, is this chat the titty milk black market?
[4:58:50] Wooshu: breast milk from a cow?
[4:58:53] Tyfonius: the brand
[4:58:57] barskebaard: human breast milk
[4:59:05] danmand00d: hot sauce is good if it has flavor you just have to find a hot sauce that still has flavor and isnt JUST hot
[4:59:06] B_Rize: milf milk helps the most tbh
[4:59:07] suslae: we got a haircut?
[4:59:07] Manimon_: na
[4:59:22] tyrannical96: Siete makes good chips, Yellow Bird habanero is where its at tho

[5:22:06] qwafflesnsyrup: lol
[5:22:07] phreakzyo: YES
[5:22:07] Shepp22: that is a little too close to a Karen cut
[5:22:08] the_snarf: i mean it still is a walk, it's not hard

[5:22:20] Towenaar2: fuck them pugs EZ
[5:22:20] CoolTV: it is a walk in the park @SONII joined a random pug, we 1-shot every boss without discord
[5:22:22] Tyfonius: people said BFD was too easy, now gnomer is too hard, funny how that works
[5:22:27] qwafflesnsyrup: rip too soon
[5:22:28] Ranzorx: you guys are streamers think of the trade chat pugs lol
[5:22:30] gromp_vendor: I mean it is a walk in the park for me, cleared it in 6hour today, Kappa
[5:22:37] Wooshu: the problem with Gnomer is the defenses on enemies
[5:22:39] AlphaSimply: its really not
[5:22:42] the_snarf: there are 4 bosses that have basically no mechanics
[5:22:42] Manimon_: true
[5:22:46] badman1030: last boss kinda rough
[5:22:47] Gillbawk: this boss is gonna get nerfed
[5:22:48] badman1030: but not hard
[5:22:49] Ranzorx: make it 20 man
[5:22:51] Gillbawk: it’s really tough
[5:22:56] jschroe3: you mean... actual progression?!?!
[5:22:58] aaronstunes: raids used to take months to progress through, it was fun not clearing it immediately

[5:23:27] Veriance: Thermaplugg isn't that hard, once you get the strats down for each phase it becomes easy
[5:23:28] Selecktt: The only thing I dont like about gnomer is the emphasis on mechanics involving ranged dps. Like electrocutioner. you need a minimum of 4 ranged dps for that, if you use your healers to split. leaves only 2 mdps slots.
[5:23:29] ohg33: @gwk_exclusive Yes it is
[5:23:30] Shailax: D: WAT
[5:23:30] Wooshu: KEKW

[5:27:54] 5thD5thD: youll need like 1 - 2 deep freezers to store it
[5:27:54] anuel214: in cali ?
[5:27:54] Tracy_83_: $4/lbs
[5:27:55] john57galt: 1/2 a cow is all you need
[5:27:55] heyskylark: Just feed it ghost powder
[5:27:56] Selecktt: They feed themselves. they graze.
[5:27:59] Wooshu: its expensive
[5:27:59] AlphaSimply: more than the meat you buy
[5:27:59] Gillbawk: go to a butcher you can probably buy a whole leg
[5:27:59] jaxismynam3: its like 5-6 dollars a pound, and a full cow is like 400lbs
[5:28:01] Manimon_: 2k
[5:28:03] mithrandoig: you gotta want it
[5:28:03] cls33: half a cow lasts my fam of 3 a year
[5:28:04] Shepp22: gonna need a lot of freezer space
[5:28:06] jschroe3: what is your time worth to take care of the cow too
[5:28:08] dmm02: get 1/2 a cow for 4-500
[5:28:09] Kaehl_: some go for MORE depending on the breed
[5:28:10] Zellhound: youre clearing 4-500 hanging weight
[5:28:11] Nooshbag98: free if you find one on a farm
[5:28:14] ballsofruenkiller: U dont need a whole cow if u arent living with other people.. u only need like 1/2 a cow
[5:28:17] heroxenophanes: cheaper to buy a quarter from a good bucher
[5:28:17] mithrandoig: THE COW
[5:28:17] dmm02: it will fill up a 6ft deep freeze
[5:28:19] Hozitojones: you gotta pet the cow as well
[5:28:22] Anammox: it means it takes a lot of work and money
[5:28:24] leatherhandss: YOU BUY 2... HAVE THEM MAKE BABIES... AND RINSE AND REPEAT
[5:28:24] Gillbawk: go to a butcher
[5:28:24] Cambsyy: Go hunting get an elk
[5:28:29] Duntreadgood: Cows are like big ass dogs
[5:28:29] Wooshu: You gotta go in with friends on the cow
[5:28:29] heyskylark: Imagine the pump you'll get deadlifting the cow onto the hook for prep
[5:28:30] danmand00d: this D you gotta want it
[5:28:31] gwk_exclusive: you'll save more money than buying steaks and ground beef at the store. longer process though for sure
[5:28:31] TrillOGtv: be out there taking care of it
[5:28:32] gromp_vendor: I can be a cow for you
[5:28:32] Korvynah: you have to love the cow dude
[5:28:33] mithrandoig: just a mantra lol
[5:28:36] Anammox: ever played minecraft? just feed wheat and make babies
[5:28:39] fanniclap: So idr alot of the conversation but I remember hearing something about the big growers etc or whatever have only like 60 crops left because their soil is going to shit. Regenerative farming or something is really the only way. I probably butchered tf out of that
[5:28:41] Shepp22: Joe Rogan over heee
[5:28:44] 5thD5thD: i could never raise and feed an animal to then slaughter it lol
[5:28:44] Shailax: u can find plenty of cows at walmart if u kno what i mean
[5:28:45] Manimon_: for a 2 year old cow u pay like 2k and about 100 a week for food
[5:28:46] Hozitojones: d:
[5:28:46] B_Rize: You have to name the cow first
[5:28:47] Hozitojones: D:

[5:28:49] Slaughter13x: You need to love WoW & your PC
[5:28:49] AlphaSimply: and Milk it
[5:28:50] Korvynah: nah that aint how it works
[5:28:50] Kaehl_: Breeding cows is expensive and require a lot of money and land.
[5:28:54] Wooshu: You will buy the cow and never meet it until its steaks
[5:28:55] erawin1990: like a hefer? like a big girl GF?
[5:29:00] erawin1990: or a real cow?
[5:29:01] 5thD5thD: over farming
[5:29:04] leatherhandss: @SONII YOU BUY 2... HAVE THEM MAKE BABIES... AND RINSE AND REPEAT

[5:29:12] Gillbawk: bbw
[5:29:12] 5thD5thD: no more nutrients in the soil
[5:29:13] terlet_terwilliger: normal farms lose like 1-2 inches of soil each year
[5:29:13] erawin1990: im memeing
[5:29:15] anuel214: they just keep them for a year normally so the calf its self could set you back a few grand and then the food to bulk up the animal sheesh
[5:29:19] fanniclap: The chemicals they use for the crops to grow destroys all the nutrients in the soil
[5:29:21] Gillbawk: you eat for weeks
[5:29:22] leatherhandss: @SONII CHEMICALS FROM EVERY FACET OF LIFE LEACHING INTO THE GROUND
[5:29:22] erawin1990: yea ino bro i was joking
[5:29:23] fanniclap: something like that
[5:29:24] mithrandoig: i think it could be worth it for you the way you eat
[5:29:29] DaSeegs: its cheaper to just buy the half a cow after its butchered
[5:29:29] Gillbawk: come down to the bbw farm
[5:29:32] Wooshu: first of all we call big girls BBW not Heffer
[5:29:47] Kaehl_: You have to rotate your crop type or you will destroy the soil quality.
[5:29:49] stailord: make ur walock go in metaform and 1 shot bomb with searing pain
[5:29:52] leatherhandss: BY DESIGN LOL
[5:30:00] erawin1990: @Wooshu lol

[5:30:04] zdravimdruzstvo: :D

[5:30:24] Wooshu: no
[5:30:25] terlet_terwilliger: No, it's not the chemicals, the machines they use make them lose like 1-2 inches of soil each year, it takes like 1000 years for the Earth to make 1 inch of soil
[5:30:26] Gillbawk: no
[5:30:29] 0dicul: 6.99 for rotisery
[5:30:29] leatherhandss: YOU CAN HAVE A CHICKEN COOP INYOUR BACKYARD PRETY SMALL

[5:30:51] OGTigolebitties: that’s why I only eat baby seal
[5:30:51] BadGerbilLion: you need a rooster to fertilize them
[5:30:54] Gillbawk: so you gotta be careful
[5:30:54] brokedownalice: you need a rooster for that
[5:30:55] iPlayCuzFun: you'd need a rooster
[5:30:55] OutlawTree: chickens cheap as hell
[5:30:55] Kaehl_: Chicken are not expensive but you need a LOT of chickens to maintain 5-6 a day. And that gets costly
[5:30:56] anuel214: not really i got them in my back yard they will kill your lawn tho
[5:30:56] AlphaSimply: @Tracy_83_ mhm
