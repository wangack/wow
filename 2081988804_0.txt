[0:19:42] nordman8: why not
[0:19:43] smagg2: ye thats how they are communicating it, that you dont get full uptime on dismantle, but I think the diff is like 1-2 dps overall or smth
[0:20:00] smagg2: not overall*
[0:20:01] exec92: 1 dps omE
[0:20:28] B4NJ33: impact is good for everything tho, so while you only have 1 that might be the way to go
