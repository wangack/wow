[3:22:35] Holysal: yes they are the worst dps
[3:22:37] Alaquane: they just had 2 runes buffs. one by 100% damage and another by 200%
[3:22:37] im_capy: they got a buff last patch I tihnk
[3:22:38] carmelchaos: They probably still have mana problems
[3:22:41] kingchocobo: I saw the changes but, the changes were to both of the chest runes for shadow so.

[3:23:07] shale93: idk how much it helped them
[3:23:09] Infinitepeeep: which is lvl 40
[3:23:09] cashbrook: hunter oom bad too but their pet makes up for it
[3:23:12] DoRebellious: The shadow dps is improved after the buffed but too much healer need and no dual spec for me to go full shadow.
[3:23:21] MN_Generic: even with the buff just still we just go oom and do no dmg
[3:24:33] kingchocobo: We need replenishment!
[3:24:37] ClassicMalcontent: Shouldn't see any L25 Holy Paladins or L25 Resto Druids either (sadly). They are gimped compared to Priests and Mages who heal. Pallies should be ret or prot. Druids anything other than resto. It's not the players fault. It just is what it is.
[3:24:44] Moobot: you can figure out how long you've been following any channel by simply clicking on your own name in chat :)
[3:25:27] mrhodor117: i was gonna say resto sham is fun but i see ally here :p
[3:25:53] LimpyMcGee1: 40 is going to be that sweet spot we will see alot more specs open up. Will also depend on what runes we get going forward.

[3:44:12] Slaanesh74: what worked well for me in a low dps group is to have mages/casters just wand in p1 and burn everything in p2
[3:44:42] abracka_: same way as wotlk
[3:44:46] Slaanesh74: ewww, holy paladin
[3:44:51] Molvonos: Yep.  When I was dpsing as my mage, when I got o 50%, I waned back up to 75%, then burned down in P2, Evocated, and burned some more.
[3:44:51] Slaanesh74: yikes
[3:45:14] abracka_: i'd beacon the other healer, or whoever gets chains if it goes off

[3:46:47] Alaquane: get more crits yall
[3:46:51] majorbaker69: How is Meta Tanking @towelliee
[3:47:55] Angry_Viking: have paladin put beacon on priest so they stay alive to heal tank and raid
[3:47:59] GodKingMuninn: @Slaanesh74 Lol in my group I was 4th as tank with the average dps being 45. And thats all it came down to interrupts and then prayiong in p2 that healer didn't get 2 mind blasts in a row
[3:48:15] Alaquane: different beacon angry
[3:49:07] Alaquane: not the perma buff beacon, it's the temporary 10 second big mana cost bacon

[3:52:46] itscityboy: 11
[3:52:47] Amarlian: is there something not being captured by details?
[3:53:02] Slaanesh74: most of the damage is healed by pom
[3:53:25] Slaanesh74: paladin would be better just being ret and off healing with white damage
[3:53:32] GodKingMuninn: details is updated for SoD, just often will have bnroken tooltips
[3:53:51] Amarlian: Do they have any bandages?
[3:54:05] Slaanesh74: like just autoattacking with a seal and helping heal/interrupt
[3:54:20] BubbaChubbs420: yeah
[3:54:23] ClassicMalcontent: Priests or Healing Mages. Other healers are just too gimped in P1. It's not their fault they just cannot come to the raid as healers unfortunately. It's poor balancing on Blizzards part by capping at L25 without other adjustments. L25 cap is what it is.
[3:54:26] BubbaChubbs420: it's dumb
[3:54:33] Slaanesh74: prayer of mending is too good
[3:54:38] Mckhero: should have giuven them holy shoclk at level 10
[3:54:40] drunkieduckie: cause classic
[3:54:52] Mozzeyy_: this boss is so stupid with its magic resistances
[3:54:54] MN_Generic: there to busy nerfing/buffing hunters to care kek
[3:54:59] abracka_: i mean, it's the same shit in retail lol
[3:55:04] GodKingMuninn: level 25 cap was so dumb lol. I'd understand 30 cause lots of people would get iconic cap stone
[3:55:04] Zapp_Brannigan86: pallies maybe should have got beacon this phase
[3:55:05] dr_meowser: are you guys using Free action potions for second phase chains?
[3:55:24] GodKingMuninn: They buffed boomy and spriest
[3:55:26] racketpunch: yea, i found out the hard way with holy palis.  it was hard to heal a DM and I was within the level range w/ decent gear
[3:55:31] ClassicMalcontent: Blizzard only interested in nerfing apparently. Sadly.
[3:55:53] UltraKSlaya: lol they need more devs on SoD
[3:56:07] ClassicMalcontent: @GodKingMuninn yeah. Well. Good luck with Spriest. Maybe a boomkin is viable. But, eh.
[3:56:13] Slaanesh74: holy paladin should have gotten, Light of the Dawn, instead of Beacon in P1
[3:56:23] CousinAvi86: rogue kick on chains only? mages try to CS mind blast when its up, another paladin help with chains interrupt and the rest interrupt mind blast on CD? are people spreading in P2 to not chain the chains?
[3:56:25] Nerendis: Idk, I'm chillen healing as restro druid rn.
[3:57:29] PotbellyGoat: I think them not developing to bring the player vs bring the class is a problem in the majority of Blizzard games
[3:57:29] GodKingMuninn: Hopefully the pallies are putting out mights too. Thats like 20 dps for melee early on

[3:58:00] BubbaChubbs420: rogue is doing work
[3:58:03] Slaanesh74: people should just spread out so they don't chain it onto everyone
[3:58:14] Nerendis: @Slaanesh74 I'm hard chilling as resto actually. Idk why people are sleeping on it. Priest/Druid is the way
[3:58:19] GodKingMuninn: oh and might on pets as well. AP scaling on pets still fucked lol
[3:58:37] Slaanesh74: I'm not saying it's bad. it's just that priest gets all the attention

[3:59:26] Molvonos: You can def tell who plays retail and who lingers in Classic huffing nostalgia fumes.
[3:59:29] ClassicMalcontent: See? They should worry about buffing subpar classes. They can balance PVP, fine, keep those separate (if only they always would) and keep PVE viable for any would be nice.
[3:59:32] Nerendis: @Slaanesh74 Yeah that's what I mean. People are hyper focused on priest when they could easily slot in a druid
[3:59:32] GodKingMuninn: all pets viable
[3:59:47] Alaquane: scorpid should be fine. assuming claw learned
[4:00:13] Slaanesh74: it's just the dispel honestly, that's it. combat rez is a pretty clutch thing though
[4:00:46] GodKingMuninn: then p2 remove curse
[4:01:33] Alaquane: 400 mana on battle rez is pain
[4:01:34] GodKingMuninn: we also made hunter pets taunt in p2 to force them to take 1 or 2 mind blasts to give healers a few extra seconds

[4:03:09] Slaanesh74: Holy Pally is not good
[4:03:15] ClassicMalcontent: Yep. Sadly. It is what it is.
[4:03:23] Wulfgrym: its like hunters, need to bring hunters cuz they are just the best
[4:03:28] CeruleanStar: is mage healing good with that mass regen or they just meh?
[4:03:30] GodKingMuninn: classic priest only has 1 spec though.
[4:03:40] deviathann: What was the Priest healing with ? like spells etc
[4:03:47] Slaanesh74: holy works too
[4:03:55] gelimarr: I'm in BFD as a shadow priest
[4:03:59] Slaanesh74: everyone specing disc, but holy is fine
[4:03:59] firehawk73: Didn't Ion say "bring the player, not the class?"
[4:04:01] Mozzeyy_: classic is even more meta oriented than retail LUL
[4:04:01] valianya: How is mage healing?
[4:04:12] Slaanesh74: hell I healed my first BFD speced all shadow
[4:04:30] ClassicMalcontent: @firehawk73 that's in modern/retail not classic. SoD attempted to shift that but it's not overcoming the classic era.
[4:04:44] GodKingMuninn: of course classic is more meta oriented. like 60% of classes didn't work as intended until like wrath lol
[4:04:55] Slaanesh74: you don't really gain much throughput from any of the talents.
[4:05:02] valianya: Is mage healing good enough to use a mage as healer?
[4:05:09] GodKingMuninn: ex: Mindblast generating 1000 threat, where as taunts were 600-650
[4:05:38] BubbaChubbs420: @valianya we cleared it with priest and mage last lockout

[4:06:54] Zapp_Brannigan86: Sorry if you have already talked about it, but you saw the stuff about sodapoppin getting his gold and items deleted for buying gold?
[4:07:01] gelimarr: Healing in shadow spec
[4:07:02] Zapp_Brannigan86: see*
[4:07:09] valianya: I still want to see a Hunter healer with runes.  Or a pet that aoe heals in melee or something
[4:07:24] Amarlian: In was thinking about healing and mana issues, I wonder if people are down ranking skills at all
[4:07:25] wEiRdO_dUdE: Items deleted, ouch
[4:07:33] GodKingMuninn: how is anyone shocked he literally said he would 3 times lol
[4:07:46] TheGiant99: D4 you don't have to redo campaign POE you gotta redo the campaign everytime which sucks
[4:07:53] Slaanesh74: @Nerendis I ended up going disc because of wand damage and the CD
[4:08:11] UltraKSlaya: don't buy gold kids!
[4:08:13] GodKingMuninn: if I didn't have to redo campaign every season in poe I'd play it sooooo much more
[4:08:13] valianya: They probably  deleted his bought items and gold specifically to avoid banning him
[4:08:18] PotbellyGoat: no brainer playing D4 as we speak
[4:08:23] GodKingMuninn: Yet.
[4:08:27] DarthWrex: POE2 will have WASD
[4:08:33] Nerendis: @Slaanesh74 Good idea imo. I run the 0 Mana wrath rune because 1 other runes suck, 2 any healer damage is bis.
[4:08:42] TheGiant99: POE doesn't yet either
[4:08:54] Zapp_Brannigan86: slap on the wrist only
[4:09:07] pk99: 🤡
[4:09:11] ClassicMalcontent: Wait but they did something no? They deleted his items and gold, yes?
[4:09:20] GodKingMuninn: if i don't  gotta do campaign in poe2 oh boy i'd be so happy lol
[4:09:23] valianya: Far as I know they don't go in and delete gold and items from anyone else, they normally just ban
[4:09:28] ClassicMalcontent: Oh I see what you mean.
[4:09:44] aspiration89: Yep
[4:09:52] kcwishbone: I got caught about 6 months ago :(   I got my gold removed and banned for 10 days
[4:09:52] HaxzorJimDuggan: i rather buy a pack of cards then buy gold in a video game
[4:09:53] ClassicMalcontent: Oh so he was treated differently. Got it.
[4:10:05] ClassicMalcontent: I had no idea what blizz did besides banning.
[4:10:08] pk99: I had guildies in wrath have all their gold taken + 2 week ban
[4:10:10] Swimmingly: buying sod gold rn is insane. quests at lvl 25 print gold
[4:10:41] GodKingMuninn: the classic devs have voiced numerous times on twitter they don't do a lot of stuff because they're scared of the unga bunga community
[4:11:00] OviTheGray: delete gold and items.. is enough
[4:11:08] d2darkalliance: @towelliee how do we know the streamer bought gold or just somethings that streamer say for attention?
[4:11:10] valianya: He's guild leader of biggest content creator guild in HC classic and collectively the biggest source of content on Twitch for HC
[4:11:12] Slaanesh74: real world works that way too
[4:11:29] Zapp_Brannigan86: @OviTheGray the thing is for most people they get banned, not just stuff deleted and he didnt
[4:11:29] JoshuaTree6969: i just started playing WoW again for the first time in over 10 years
[4:11:56] ClassicMalcontent: Temp ban and remove stuff/gold would have been a good thing.
[4:11:58] sycnessx: just got here - who is 'him'

[4:24:16] MortalLesuj: I WATCH TOWELLIE BECAUSE MY DAD INTRODUCED ME TO HIM WHEN I WAS 4
[4:24:17] BraerHZ: part of that issue is that the view count only reflects current viewership

[4:24:20] BlueSkidew: I don't like when people stare at me. Im camera shy
[4:24:26] BraerHZ: theres no insight in the twitch UI
