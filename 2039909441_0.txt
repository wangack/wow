[1:12:14] AceOfFlame: @Raivan994 omg, i dont know what it is with you people thinking its either 100% needs to be removed or its a "waste" of dev time instead thinking of "well maybe 20-30% less premades,  thats better then 0%
[1:12:14] madgarlicjr: NO
[1:12:16] father_ruckus_: no
[1:12:21] father_ruckus_: put them in the raid

[1:13:18] hauserdot: chromatic boots EZ
[1:13:20] Bloodraven2488: and the sergent cloak
[1:13:20] TheEyeVII: look, if you play sod for pvp you aint doing it right, wpvp is for unskilled cowards ganking, imo
[1:13:25] KrotonGG: They should fix the premade problem first imo
[1:13:26] Lionkingler1: they made new pvp items. lvl 25 version and the rank 3 cloak
[1:13:28] Atomized: JUST GRIND HONOR EVERY DAY
[1:13:32] madgarlicjr: FFS
[1:13:42] 7skengz: Sounds like retail tings
[1:13:53] Raivan994: @aceofflame  the point is nothing changes , premades don't want 30min games and people will find a way to keep grinding pugs, all yall achieved is wasting time
[1:13:54] korjillah: true
[1:13:57] boopbopbamski: its true
[1:14:00] AceOfFlame: @Raivan994 it does change
[1:14:03] Zaziben: if i have a crit build im screwed
[1:14:07] lightkekerino: bro this helm is so overpowered u crazy
[1:14:10] paulthecat: It reduces dmg taken, but it is hidden
[1:14:13] Bronloch: or versatility ?
[1:14:13] TheEyeVII: @7skengz no shit, it already is, only new thing about sod is imported retail abilities
[1:14:18] AceOfFlame: @Raivan994 taking off 30% of premades is a change, not doing anything is not changing nothing
[1:14:22] hauserdot: kekinsano
[1:14:23] iBanEvader: PvE and PvP should be the same
[1:14:23] Lionkingler1: wut
[1:14:32] myboyZach: @Bronloch too much retail
[1:14:33] madgarlicjr: HYPERCATJAM HYPERCLAP

[1:15:04] hauserdot: isn’t there already pvp gear
[1:15:10] hauserdot: what’s he talking bout
[1:15:17] AceOfFlame: @Raivan994 your thinking of basically, whats the point of perma banning gold buyers..they can just use discord to buy gold so that be waste of dev time

[1:15:41] cokez999: its pretty cheap so idc
[1:15:41] araltus791: dual spec, or cap respec cost at 1g still
[1:15:44] Bobby_NPM: yes
[1:15:45] lizcat_: what will it hurt
[1:15:46] Atomized: dual spec cucks should leave classic forever
[1:15:46] GoldenFool69: @25 changing runes is basically dual-spec.
[1:15:46] ajunta__: how about death knight
[1:15:48] boopbopbamski: i guess sure
[1:15:49] meatmorsel: 1
[1:15:49] TheEyeVII: how about if you wanna play wow for pvp, play retail arenas or wrath arenas & git gud :)
[1:15:52] iBanEvader: the lowered respec cost is already great
[1:15:56] thaplayboy69: if you dont like it, dont buy it
[1:15:56] MattyFuffins: They think they do, but they don't.
[1:15:58] Utmost777: why would you ever NOT want it?
[1:16:06] thaplayboy69: there is 0 valid reason to not add it
[1:16:07] OgiBrc1: OgiBrc1 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 14 months, currently on a 9 month streak! 
[1:16:08] lizcat_: with the runes it’s a good idea
[1:16:11] daijahaden: Seen the new channel five video from the US border? Holeey
[1:16:12] Raivan994: @aceofflame  not remotely the same thing but you do you
[1:16:18] Slaanesh74: just make a crafted pvp set
[1:16:20] myboyZach: we live ptr
[1:16:20] Mertauh: We pay we say SMOrc
[1:16:27] AceOfFlame: @Raivan994 fixed premade AV was 40 man and thus wasn't  flood of every bg literally just being a premade and took way more effort to do, again, your thinking is so stupid since your comparing a 10 man vs a 40 man gathering
[1:16:29] madgarlicjr: fuck paladins
[1:16:30] hauserdot: would be nice to have dual spec for raiding and then playing game
[1:16:30] Atomized: @thaplayboy69 What the fuck are you talking about, I don't want OTHERS to have it either
[1:16:48] AceOfFlame: @Raivan994 yes it is and your dumb to think its not, because "they can use discord" is a stupid logic because you can apply anything to it
[1:16:50] Zaziben: you dont need to respec to paly other rroles
[1:17:10] Lionkingler1: warrior respeccing for pvp next phase
[1:17:11] Zaziben: its mostly gear
[1:17:13] thaplayboy69: @thaplayboy69 bro there is 0 valid reason to not have dual spec. give me one good reason
[1:17:13] iBanEvader: it's just way handier
[1:17:16] Raivan994: @aceofflame  I'm esger
[1:17:17] Atomized: Cutting the respec costs down is good enough
[1:17:21] sargent_baddy: pvp / pve builds
[1:17:24] Mertauh: in 2024 gaming culture if you're not fully optimized you can barely get an invite to a group that will clear content
[1:17:26] thaplayboy69: @thaplayboy69 what the fuck are you talking about lol
[1:17:26] myboyZach: dps has leniency
[1:17:37] hauserdot: your raid leader or officers will want you to be proper raid spec
[1:17:37] FriendmanBrother: i can play boomie as feral Kappa
[1:17:43] TheEndIsNear777: i want QUAD spec YEP
[1:17:44] djbetrayer: pve vs pvp spec too
[1:17:51] crawlthewall: Dual spec removes the need for in between general talents
[1:17:52] Harles_: @Zaziben this is s1 that doesnt play a role that can do multiple roles
[1:17:55] Wadjaah: gatekeeping dual spec out of SoD is not a hill to die on
[1:18:04] Raivan994: @aceofflame  eager to read the crybaby posts of people still getting farmed in WSG after changes go live
[1:18:06] korjillah: if they put it behind a decent gold sink it would be great
[1:18:14] hauserdot: fuck that
[1:18:21] hauserdot: no changes
[1:18:23] GoldenFool69: It's so much easier already to get 100g. Who cares.
[1:18:25] sargent_baddy: how much gold should Dual spec be tho 100g? 200g?
[1:18:34] AceOfFlame: @Raivan994 oh now I know what it is, your just premade sweat that hates the fact that premades are cancer right now to meta and hate people want changes to it
[1:18:43] Juronimo_: @hauserdot this isn't classic this is SoM
[1:18:46] Mertauh: I mean even noobs get their mount at what like level 45? doesn't seem like an issue
[1:18:52] Juronimo_: SoM rules apply
[1:18:53] rjhasnoclue: nice
[1:18:54] deathtxne: hey staysafe
[1:18:57] Divinus09: good need 6 of them
[1:19:02] Lionkingler1: do like 10 quests at 40 and you have the gold
[1:19:02] iBanEvader: @hauserdot we need all the changes
[1:19:03] 1UserWins1: That's actually a great change
[1:19:14] Atomized: all these people can't spend the 1g to respec but they're saying -50g off a mount isn't a big deal
[1:19:23] pogxgaming: @StaysafeTV or just play warlock or paladin free mount
[1:19:27] MattyFuffins: I'm a paladin main. I'm very not worried about it.
[1:19:27] crawlthewall: in my eyes, the whole concept is that Everyone is included. Dont need to sweat. ever.
[1:19:28] Rekrian: Rekrian subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 11 months! Big wiener
[1:19:42] Raivan994: @aceofflame  yeah i'm not dumb enough to grind 21k rep 200points at a time with 9 mouthbreather mid fighting pugs
[1:19:46] thaplayboy69: @Atomized its got nothing to do w the cost, its the convinience. do you even play a class with 2 viable builds?
[1:19:48] TwoHandHammy: starting season of discovery today!
[1:19:50] plae007: agreed, delay
[1:19:51] Divinus09: L take
[1:19:53] iBanEvader: inflation on gear/consumables is gonna be insane though LUL @StaysafeTV

[1:20:07] Harles_: WTFF
[1:20:09] Atomized: NA
[1:20:11] 1UserWins1: Do you think that couch is in pain?
[1:20:18] TheEyeVII: literally idc
[1:20:21] korjillah: @TwoHandHammy too busy tweeting about ashenvale success to hit the gym
[1:20:21] iBanEvader: @thaplayboy69 YEP
[1:20:28] Lionkingler1: let blaster blast YEP
[1:20:29] crawlthewall: Dont delay. Allow sweaters to have something to do that gives advantage
[1:20:33] iBanEvader: delay it by a month
[1:20:33] TwoHandHammy: @korjillah LOLOL
[1:20:34] AceOfFlame: @Raivan994 I do think you are
[1:20:58] Lionkingler1: its a loaded question influencing voter
[1:21:00] TwoHandHammy: I'm torn on what class to play!
[1:21:12] Frostlicious: make lockout either 7 days or 20-25 mans
[1:21:12] Raivan994: @aceofflame  QQ more and don't forget to make a reddit post baby
[1:21:16] iBanEvader: the sweats always ruin the fun
[1:21:19] thaplayboy69: @thaplayboy69 he 100% plays warlock or something and just plays 1 build has never respecced in his life lol
[1:21:19] SepeIio: SCHIZO
[1:21:23] AceOfFlame: @Raivan994 next time when want to use logic, dont use "discord" as a way to argue because people can fix que not even being in a party
[1:21:32] cokez999: or they just have jobs lol
[1:21:39] myboyZach: i wish i worked from home ffs
[1:21:44] Lionkingler1: GIGACHAD blaster
[1:21:50] 0scarM1k3: Some of us have jobs...
[1:21:54] thaplayboy69: ye fuckem
[1:22:00] iBanEvader: delay it by a month!
[1:22:00] ajunta__: amen
[1:22:04] TheEyeVII: elitist LFR raiders, love to see it LUL

[1:22:07] FriendlyTacoMan: BASEDCIGAR DELAY IT
[1:22:07] PaulamisPrime: Delay delay delay
[1:22:08] kasualkaliber: some of us shower regularly
[1:22:08] Frostlicious: ??
[1:22:08] Adlnferos: 2 Werkstatt
[1:22:11] Lionkingler1: delay it by 4 months. So dads with 10 kids and 15 jobs can catch up
[1:22:11] 0scarM1k3: MAN OF THE PEOPLE
[1:22:11] sargent_baddy: 3 day delay?
[1:22:11] Divinus09: missing a lockout doesn't matter because your gear won't drop anyway LUL
[1:22:13] sementa4k: Delay 1 month
[1:22:14] seymourmoney: I'd love for it to be delayed 2 weeks
[1:22:15] tidy____: its a 3 day reset can't, understand why ppl care so much, will be so many resets anyway. We have seen now ppl getting drained quite quickly with 3 day resets anyway
[1:22:19] Atomized: imagine how overgeared those same guys are gonna be after 2 weeks. they'd love it. they don't even know what they want
[1:22:25] kaladhras: I think it neuters the hype for the phase launch
[1:22:26] crawlthewall: We need room for people to be competitive. Sweaters are only casuals that push hard
[1:22:32] Signa_arize: damn, 20 player when
[1:22:32] myboyZach: OSRS?
[1:22:35] numblezzz: im struggling to give a fuck enough to have an opinion about this
[1:22:43] iBanEvader: @tidy____ it's just a week man, won't matter that much
[1:22:46] Lionkingler1: @Atomized you are prebis within a few hours. Literally afk for 2 weeks
[1:22:54] crawlthewall: Race for world 1st
[1:22:57] crawlthewall: gives life
[1:22:59] levesconte: all of scarlet monastery should be a raid 4 tier raid
[1:23:02] lightkekerino: I play sweaty and I kind of want 1 week
[1:23:03] Divinus09: falling behind lol
[1:23:10] moneyfornothing69: eric sounds like a good dude to play wow with
[1:23:17] TheEyeVII: everyone on classic is by default a casual
[1:23:18] numblezzz: says the dude that got hc naxx world first a couple months ago
[1:23:25] tidy____: @iBanEvader Let people push if they want, it's so extremely casual anyway, let them have something
[1:23:28] Atomized: @Lionkingler1 nah, you've have to be super sweaty to gear up that fast
[1:23:34] thaplayboy69: @numblezzz not rly the same tho
[1:23:36] Frostlicious: Its hard not to speed level in a 20 year old game @StaysafeTV
[1:23:38] madgarlicjr: Peggers look what i discovered *googles everything
[1:23:42] kaladhras: tbh this guy probably wants to miss the first lockout so there's a joardee guide for him to watch before he goes in the raid
[1:23:46] myboyZach: the warlock rune hunt was fun!
[1:23:47] numblezzz: @thaplayboy69 i mean when he said "im a casual now"
[1:23:47] TwoHandHammy: worth going rogue in SOD?
[1:23:47] crawlthewall: delay kills world first race
[1:23:48] iBanEvader: @tidy____ push what?
[1:23:53] Raivan994: @aceofflame  don't cry boo
[1:23:56] Lionkingler1: @Atomized are you aware what prebis means? its literally quest rewards and SM armory drops for warrior. Literally takes 2 hours max once you are lvl 40
[1:23:57] Harles_: trying to find that meta rune was amazing
[1:23:59] thaplayboy69: @thaplayboy69 now=/=a few months ago??
[1:24:05] cjadude: at least lol
[1:24:06] iBanEvader: @tidy____ push the efficiency and elitism?
[1:24:07] saintopiaa: 4
[1:24:10] Slitze: some ppl don't have the luxury of sitting on their ass all day and work from home
[1:24:14] tidy____: @iBanEvader For first raid reset and world first
[1:24:22] Slitze: bullshitting on another monitor
[1:24:25] iBanEvader: @tidy____ there's nothing competitive about classic raiding especially not lvl 25/40 content
[1:24:26] Divinus09: can only play 1 hour a week please delay until March
[1:24:33] cjadude: casuals level slow, they actually play the game and not speed run it lol
[1:24:35] Mccdowwell: 1-3 max
[1:24:35] bigsugg: 3
[1:24:36] saintopiaa: 2 hours a day
[1:24:37] ornus5000: 2
[1:24:38] Lionkingler1: 16 hours
[1:24:39] daughtylock: 2-3
[1:24:46] TheEyeVII: people are gonna be dungeon spamming with the lev45 gear we got from bfd
[1:24:46] seymourmoney: I am a pretty average player and I can do 3 hours a day max
[1:24:50] Farenheight451: if STV is as bad as we think its going to be it will be 5hr a level @StaysafeTV
[1:25:03] Lionkingler1: So the delay is useles?? what a shocker
[1:25:15] tidy____: @iBanEvader Exactly. But some people think so still. But the casual player think way too much about 1-2 reset. Just look atm, not like ppl playing every reset anyway
[1:25:17] madgarlicjr: if your still playing wow in 2024 your either retired or living in moms basement  peepoGiggles
[1:25:18] numblezzz: if you care enough about missing a single lockout, you should care enough about making extra time to play
[1:25:20] numblezzz: non issue imo
[1:25:30] Harles_: NODDERS
[1:25:31] Bronloch: LUL STV is gonna make that 6 hours per level LUL
[1:25:32] Mertauh: all you have to do is watch 1 viewer raid to know how casual people are in this game LuL
[1:25:35] crawlthewall: Lowering ceiling harms the game overall. People play how they want instead of changing how others do
[1:25:40] lizcat_: :)
[1:25:53] iBanEvader: @tidy____ in the end I don't really care. I understand your point and I would be fine with no 1 week. I'm neutral
[1:25:54] trebolz: YEP
[1:25:56] itsae__: @crawlthewall sstvDUMB
[1:25:56] Lionkingler1: so lets nerf mythic raids so everyone can beat them week 1?
[1:26:11] ThyLordEzekiel: what negative comes from delaying tho?? i cant really find one lol
[1:26:25] Lionkingler1: casuals will be farmed like crazy in stv. No shot they will be 40 by week 3
[1:26:27] Palludenx: retail is designed for sweeties and we can see how that goes
[1:26:28] numblezzz: putting arbitrary restrictions to limit people at the front of the line to make casuals feel better is lame. i say that as a casual
[1:26:31] PowderBlack: i can only play 1-3 hours on weekdays but i make up for it by doing 16 hours hours a day on weekends lol
[1:26:39] Palludenx: sweaties
[1:26:40] Divinus09: casual friendly takes in vanilla lol
[1:26:40] tidy____: The whole SoD is casual? Absolutley nothing for a "sweaty" player to do.
[1:26:44] TheEyeVII: @ThyLordEzekiel the negative imo is from phase 2 being so late
[1:26:47] Raivan994: do we think the sweaty people just vanished? they're all on SoD dude
[1:26:57] iBanEvader: haha
[1:26:59] Moondrius: Jordee is making guides for people to get to 29 within 1.5 hours by having 20/20 quests completed and ready for turn in. Basically wanting people to rush to 40 asap to raid first week.
[1:26:59] iBanEvader: it never stops
[1:27:02] Raivan994: aint nobody still playing wotlk
[1:27:07] iBanEvader: they always find a way to be super efficient or elitist
[1:27:09] Slitze: touch fucking grass
[1:27:13] madgarlicjr: Coomer
[1:27:14] thaplayboy69: @Moondrius so cringe
[1:27:14] myboyZach: 800mg is crack omg lmao
[1:27:18] tidy____: @iBanEvader Personally I dont care that much. But I'm up for giving them something since it's so casual anyway.
[1:27:27] inflictawarlock: Sweat-orieanted LOL
[1:27:48] tomble_: phase 2 date?
[1:27:57] TheEyeVII: @Raivan994 nobody on sod is a sweaty imo, just LFR level raiders pretending they're hardcore
[1:28:00] iBanEvader: today I invited 4 grey parsers in my raid and we cleared BFD, FUCK YOU ELITIST PRICKS
[1:28:07] crawlthewall: Its same bad design as "edge of map locked" in old rpgs
[1:28:12] Frostlicious: rip
[1:28:12] seymourmoney: The sweats will play even if there's something that make sit harder for them. Casuals won't all the time. Balance it around casuals
[1:28:20] madgarlicjr: HYPERCLAP
[1:28:26] Atomized: I'd rather the raid just be easier so I don't have to worry about having prebis
[1:28:32] just_ouro: Does anyone play classic for super difficult raids?
[1:28:34] crawlthewall: Play how you want
[1:28:43] madgarlicjr: i wanna be able to play this game while binge watching sapranos
[1:28:44] MattyFuffins: definitely an IQ chart
[1:28:46] Wadjaah: it's made for dad gamers literally
[1:28:55] bigtrickymemeguy: I am at 0 right now
[1:28:57] numblezzz: there should be a single hard mode boss at the end that is significantly harder than the rest, opitional challenge for sweats. ie algalon
[1:28:57] crawlthewall: Its made for children/teenagers
[1:28:59] Raivan994: @theeyevii  literally same people who played 2019 till now
[1:29:04] 0scarM1k3: Elites in the middle
[1:29:05] zeus_cs: i vote 2.5
[1:29:07] Mccdowwell: 10
[1:29:08] sighwarlock: 3

[1:29:10] Lionkingler1: 30 minutes
[1:29:10] 5iftyfourth: 3
[1:29:10] Milanesa_De_Pollo: 1 or 2
[1:29:10] MattyFuffins: 1-2

[1:29:14] BKDDY: none bawkStare
[1:29:15] OptimusBanana420: 2-4
[1:29:16] crawlthewall: Its a game made for children
[1:29:16] CommonTeal: 2 or 3
[1:29:17] madgarlicjr: 30 mins
[1:29:17] Frostlicious: 3 and a half
[1:29:18] berno100: 1
[1:29:18] deathtxne: i work 6/7 days
[1:29:19] Prdek2: 2
[1:29:25] zeus_cs: peepoHappy
[1:29:27] Raivan994: at peak 5-8
[1:29:32] Adlnferos: Less maybe 1
[1:29:43] redRAID3R: monkaW
[1:29:43] pretty_cool_guy: yo Salute
[1:29:51] deathtxne: how much do you play staysafe Kappa
[1:29:55] madgarlicjr: one wsg a day
[1:30:02] crawlthewall: Raid logging = bad
[1:30:05] Raivan994: wsg puggers
[1:30:09] ataxx__: thats me
[1:30:09] TheEyeVII: 100% classic/sod is made for casual/bad players & they shouldn't make it harder than LFR/Normal max imo same as bfd difficulty
[1:30:10] numblezzz: i believe in designing the game for the top end even if its a small percent, creates a healthy echelon of progress
[1:30:13] BKDDY: i finished sod first week ICANT
[1:30:15] JimBobJr: thats me PogU im the raid logger PogU
[1:30:23] deathtxne: both
[1:30:25] Adlnferos: 5 mins
[1:30:26] Lionkingler1: right side of the curve
[1:30:28] VenomVeinZ: 5 mins
[1:30:36] tidy____: both ofc, always been like that
[1:30:48] Mertauh: bring back garrisons, 5 minute gameplay Peggers
[1:30:51] crawlthewall: Allow competition. leaderboards ect. its multiplayer
[1:30:51] numblezzz: i think that ideology led to retail development style
[1:30:52] Chozo88: 5 mins = WoD Garrisons
[1:30:56] madgarlicjr: Nerdge
[1:31:02] numblezzz: appeasing casuals led to retail
[1:31:14] Frostlicious: Sounds like retail classic is being mad Sadge
[1:31:19] TheEyeVII: @numblezzz tf you talking about
[1:31:27] avoidedneXt: this kids facial hair was a mistake
[1:31:29] Lionkingler1: it wont become crazy. Always casual shit fest
[1:31:32] iBanEvader: I hope there's gonna be super difficult shit also, aspirational content
[1:31:33] tomble_: wats the easiest class to play for a newbie
[1:31:35] numblezzz: @TheEyeVII LFR
[1:31:37] Farenheight451: trying to get non mmo players into mmos lead to retail not appeasing casual players
[1:31:42] crawlthewall: Just put catch up mechanics in. Thats the proven solution
[1:31:44] AceOfFlame: @tomble_ rogue
[1:31:48] kaladhras: I think you end up where p1 SoD is right now by designing for that part of the curve, the casuals don't have sweaty things to aspire to and so instead they have nothing to do for the whole back half of a phase.
[1:31:48] Lionkingler1: huge COPIUM
[1:31:49] BajeniZta: mele
[1:31:50] yolomaster420blaze: do i quit maplestory for sod
[1:32:03] MattyFuffins: retail is anything but geared toward casuals
[1:32:06] tomble_: @AceOfFlame is that jokre?
[1:32:06] numblezzz: its a symptom
[1:32:07] Raivan994: well let's not complain then when the game is handled like shit , the bulk of players woudln't know better
[1:32:09] Jazzarus_: retail is awesome, lmao
[1:32:09] iscamog: retail andys love lfr
[1:32:13] Adlnferos: M plus is the reason
[1:32:14] cockjab: there are so many things that make retail bad
[1:32:17] TheEyeVII: @numblezzz you're hilariously ignorant
[1:32:17] devux69: sod is more casual than retail
[1:32:17] ryufromstreets6: retail's top end raids are literally anti-casual lol
[1:32:20] madgarlicjr: wow old
[1:32:21] trebolz: it's one of them
[1:32:21] iBanEvader: @Adlnferos m+ is amazing
[1:32:23] Milanesa_De_Pollo: LFR andies are paying for retail
[1:32:28] AceOfFlame: @tomble_ why would I be joking? It's by far the easiest class in pve
[1:32:28] Utmost777: 100%
[1:32:30] EASEPEASE: Using LFR to demean LFR KEKW so out of touch. Retail is by a huge margin more difficult than classic
[1:32:31] big_stape_: hard agree
[1:32:36] craboskai: classic is literally braindead to play KEKL
[1:32:37] Mertauh: retail died when they released cross server BG queues in vanilla YEP
[1:32:38] numblezzz: @TheEyeVII ad hominem attack with no substance towards my point. high IQ
[1:32:43] deathtxne: LFR is so hard, you wipe more than in a pug normal Kappa
[1:32:50] AceOfFlame: ehhh classic players make classic era way more sweaty then retail does
[1:32:50] EASEPEASE: LFR to demean retail*
[1:32:53] Zaziben: but it is, retail is only sweaty at the extremes
[1:32:54] tidy____: SoD is made for players around 30-35 with busy lifes. Everyone gets everything, nothing is hard to grind and thats why its popular
[1:32:55] iBanEvader: I think difficulty and elitism might've been the downfall of WoW's populatiry
[1:32:55] GunTheRedneck: true, i think theres just MORE sweaty players in classic, BECAUSE its more accessable
[1:32:57] Bronloch: retail pvp is legit brainbuster
[1:32:59] iBanEvader: popularity*
[1:33:00] Adlnferos: Min max is crazy in retail
[1:33:02] genjimainofc: the change was far too casual tho
[1:33:06] Utmost777: And Retail has the difficulty heavily loaded into end game where Classic has it spread over the whole game.
[1:33:09] alec_in_chains: Leveling is more casual, but endgame is nuts
[1:33:13] crawlthewall: People mean that its quality of life casual. Not old school long form RPG
[1:33:30] numblezzz: i play retail arena cuz of the complexity, but the saturation of RPG mechanics has led to a stale hamster wheel of gameplay
[1:33:31] itsae__: retard opinion
[1:33:40] ZhangTuShi: retail is an example of minimal casual content. if all the content more people could do reliably it would be more popular
[1:33:40] CygnusC: nobody cares about world first Gnomeregan
[1:33:42] EASEPEASE: There are more mechanics in a single 5 man dungeon than all of a single raid in classic. Trash has even more mechanics than classic raid encounters
[1:33:45] iBanEvader: Lost Ark literally has the same problem as WoW retail
[1:33:46] Raivan994: @tomble_  don't  bother that guy is a rtard that will bitch in dms lol
[1:33:50] redRAID3R: Racing through piss easy content EZ
[1:33:51] Zaziben: the problem is in retail leveling is a chore that has outlived its purpose
[1:33:58] Bronloch: BAKED SALAD Kreygasm
[1:34:07] TheEyeVII: @numblezzz ok fine i'll debunk it, lfr is one difficulty you forgot to mention the other 3 not to mention m+ that scales infinitely
[1:34:11] tomble_: @Raivan994 yea i figured
[1:34:13] AceOfFlame: @iBanEvader no not rly, lost ark has the problem classic wow playerbase has, heavy gate keeping on content that is braindead easy to do
[1:34:14] CazikTV: 6
[1:34:15] Utmost777: all dozens of them
[1:34:15] crawlthewall: Most players are trying to Parse right now tho
[1:34:16] iBanEvader: unbalance in class design, difficulty of content and elitist community kills mmorpgs
[1:34:16] Bronloch: 400
[1:34:16] Tracy_83_: 6
[1:34:18] King_Joymonger: at least 10
[1:34:19] Jazzarus_: you're being generous LMAO
[1:34:20] ryufromstreets6: like 80 tops
[1:34:20] paulthecat: thats so many lol
[1:34:26] cockjab: couple hundred per server
[1:34:27] itsae__: a lot
[1:34:33] Frostlicious: 90%
[1:34:35] iBanEvader: @AceOfFlame true
[1:34:46] SepeIio: a gorillion
[1:34:52] iBanEvader: @AceOfFlame but defining what is easy or hard is personal
[1:34:52] JimBobJr: billions must unsubscribe
[1:35:00] craboskai: but those people won't make it to 40 in a week KEKL
[1:35:00] cyonara74: I just want to log on for 2-3 hours, press 6 buttons, deal with 2  boss mechanics, and get loot
[1:35:01] kaladhras: I genuinely think those people would appreciate having raid guides out more than an extra 3 day lockout
[1:35:03] wookinit: the world would pause
[1:35:16] TheEyeVII: @iBanEvader not really
[1:35:16] Milanesa_De_Pollo: That's too many, I would say more like 200-300k
[1:35:23] TheEyeVII: true
[1:35:26] numblezzz: @TheEyeVII the roleplaying game thrill of building skill and power to be able to eventually enter raids was delegitmatized by being able to immediately enter raids with a queue. the higher difficulties should be the only difficulties
[1:35:27] boopbopbamski: big true
[1:35:27] Lionkingler1: are you aware that the average casual will be farmed in stv. No way they make lvl 40 within a week @StaysafeTV
[1:35:31] crawlthewall: The sweatie still explore. They just play more so have in game time quicker
[1:35:39] boopbopbamski: idc about "hard content" for classic like he said if I want that i will play retail
[1:35:40] AceOfFlame: @AceOfFlame not rly, mythic is much harder to do then normal...so its normal to gate keep mythic when your not good yourself, but normal is so easy access, classic wow gate keeps 1 mode so heavy, which is what lost ark does
[1:35:42] CazikTV: I LOVE SOD because of the adventure and the journey.
[1:35:45] Adlnferos: BASED
[1:35:47] craboskai: 'little guys' holy shit KEKL
[1:35:52] Utmost777: THIS MAN SPITTING FACTS
[1:35:58] madgarlicjr: i don't think, i do
[1:36:02] paulthecat: IT SHOULD BE DELAYED
[1:36:04] deathtxne: biased
[1:36:04] Zaziben: doesn't really matter
[1:36:11] iBanEvader: @TheEyeVII there's a lot more reasons like FOMO etc. What do you think kills mmorpgs instead of just saying "not true"
[1:36:14] TheEyeVII: ya those "key features" being.. imported RETAIL abilities, so new so fresh much wow
[1:36:21] pretty_cool_guy: FailFish
[1:36:26] crawlthewall: Why do people care if some want to no life? doesnt bother me
[1:36:27] deathtxne: im fine with either tbh, delay or no delay
[1:36:32] AceOfFlame: They probably will delay it since he liked your tweet
[1:36:33] SaucyRMD: There's a delayed release in retail, its just smart
[1:36:36] tidy____: @deathtxne Agree
[1:36:36] JimBobJr: aggrend is a blue parsing dwarf ret paladin so if you think about it he's actually the perfect person to figure out what the median player wants BASED
[1:36:44] deathtxne: i dont care, im old, i just wanna press 1 2 3 and loot loot
[1:36:50] iBanEvader: @TheEyeVII it's fresh in the context of classic
[1:36:51] just_ouro: its not like classic is an esport where you cater towards the .01%. Not sure why this is even such a hot topic. Its obvious what the average person wants.
[1:36:55] Zaziben: @JimBobJr except for premades, he hasn'
[1:37:05] Zaziben: t got exalted yet
[1:37:15] craboskai: @just_ouro the average person won't hit 40 in a week so your entire point is stupid for the raid delay KEKL
[1:37:15] Lionkingler1: WW axe isnt even prebis
[1:37:31] crawlthewall: @craboskai yeah exactly
[1:37:36] numblezzz: designing RPG/mmo progression from the top down creates a longer progression path and a sense of long term goals, rather than the hamster wheel progression in retail
[1:37:39] JimBobJr: true EZ
[1:37:39] thaplayboy69: correct
[1:37:42] djbetrayer: staff of jordan speed and top end poggers
[1:37:44] djbetrayer: bis warrior wep
[1:37:45] cockjab: drip is bis
[1:37:47] deathtxne: true
[1:37:49] thaplayboy69: ww is better anyway
[1:37:50] AceOfFlame: wait but WW is better then hydra though
[1:37:51] kaladhras: baka gaijin take
[1:37:51] GunTheRedneck: axe is better than strike anyway
[1:37:53] thaplayboy69: its literally a better item
[1:37:54] CazikTV: PURPLE SPITTING SNAKE SWORD
[1:37:58] 7skengz: ww axe gonna be better for Orcs no matter what
[1:38:03] TheEyeVII: @numblezzz you lost me with your yap opening, let's be real lfr is braindead is so is bfd it's a premade lfr which btw you can also premade lfr if you didn't know
[1:38:06] Zaziben: ww axe looka like a tin foil scuplture i mad ein lunch period
[1:38:11] Lionkingler1: SM quest reward is better than WW axe
[1:38:13] Atomized: that's how raiding has always worked in wow
[1:38:20] crawlthewall: As casuals, we all watch race to world first content/ APES pvp videos. Let it happen
[1:38:20] thaplayboy69: @Lionkingler1 alliance only
[1:38:21] madgarlicjr: its like heirlooms all over again KEKL
[1:38:22] wasser18: nice
[1:38:25] thaplayboy69: horde dont get that axe
[1:38:25] sargent_baddy: kinda true kinda not
[1:38:29] CygnusC: still haven't seen the epic
[1:38:30] guidogang: i have 90% bis on 5 toons
[1:38:31] deathtxne: i got my full bis almost in 3 pulls, love to be a healer kekw
[1:38:33] tidy____: Probably making BFD without lockouts so you can grind all gear and set XP on bosses like hardcore dungeons.
[1:38:33] thaplayboy69: im 1 piece away
[1:38:34] Sharksleep: the dads are in greens :)
[1:38:39] cockjab: if you grinded for full bfd bis you shoudlnt have to gear before the 40 raid imo
[1:38:41] myboyZach: my hunter needs bow sadge
[1:38:42] bone555: KEKW KEKW
[1:38:44] CazikTV: I got the epic xbow in my rogue last night
[1:38:46] Bronloch: you dont have the gloves!  LUL
[1:38:54] thaplayboy69: i need tier boots so badly
[1:39:02] Frostlicious: SM heroics
[1:39:05] AceOfFlame: @cockjab well there is some gear that is better then bfd in SM like the scarlet legging
[1:39:11] thecollector313: nah fuck it leave the BFD loot alone
[1:39:11] deathtxne: Pog
[1:39:17] Utmost777: POG
[1:39:22] boopbopbamski: pretty good idea
[1:39:23] deathtxne: big brain
[1:39:24] 1UserWins1: That would be a pretty good idea
[1:39:25] thecollector313: like gammas? lol lame
[1:39:27] Voidstep33: remove the lockout on BFD
[1:39:28] cockjab: @cockjab for mail ya, but for casters bfd gear is almost all better by far
[1:39:29] Youtube_Historian: or world drops
[1:39:30] JimBobJr: what if they just delete all of the BFD items people have when phase 2 comes out problem solved EZ
[1:39:30] paulthecat: nah
[1:39:31] seymourmoney: If I make another character, I would like to pug the raid becasue that feels more pog
[1:39:33] madgarlicjr: what if...we don't think about things so much, and just play the game how they make it Peggers
[1:39:33] Prdek2: Hell no, why did I play all thid time for then in P1
[1:39:34] capybaras17: like an wrath classic?
[1:39:36] CygnusC: just make BFD spammable
[1:39:36] MattyFuffins: people will complain that they had to work for the gear, and now it's being given away
[1:39:36] thaplayboy69: good idea
[1:39:38] numblezzz: i think they should just make more loot in general and increase all the loot tables
[1:39:41] deathtxne: @Prdek2 F U N
[1:39:43] iBanEvader: @TheEyeVII bro you are so fucking annoying with your ad hominems and discards of other's opinions without saying what's wrong with those opinions. Very childish.
[1:39:44] VesanTV: Gnomer quest had upgrades that you could obtain prior to 40, I'd bet on the devs having new ways to obtain loot on the way to 40 to make up for that
[1:39:44] tidy____: they will do BFD without lockouts "leveling raid"
[1:39:52] CazikTV: PLEASE ME DADDY
[1:39:52] thaplayboy69: @Prdek2 dogshit logic you got to use it for the whole phase
[1:39:57] thaplayboy69: thats why you got it early
[1:40:00] thecollector313: i think they leave the raid loot alone. like you said most people dont have it all and the ones who do arent sweating it
[1:40:00] thaplayboy69: to use it for 2 months
[1:40:09] AceOfFlame: Im curious how much exp we will get for doing a full bfd
[1:40:09] Wadjaah: @tidy____ that's not what they meant by that term
[1:40:10] SpicyMango26: <3
[1:40:18] Raivan994: I'm over bfd once ph2 hits I don't want to see that shitty dungeon ever again
[1:40:25] bboofit: !server
[1:40:25] Nightbot: NA-HORDE-CRUSADER STRIKE
[1:40:25] JimBobJr: carrying boxes back and forth forever NOPERS
[1:40:28] Rawrther: cant riad as a casual must have parse buffs consumes so im stuck with pvp
[1:40:30] crawlthewall: A lot of hardcore players dont bother making their voice heard either. so the data is skewed
[1:40:31] MattyFuffins: How many of you have a couple dozen of those boxes filled in your bank?
[1:40:34] orcenheimer: Fuck Patrick Mahomes. Ravens send them home plz
[1:40:42] tidy____: @Wadjaah It's either that or that a lockout will be give you a lot of xp.
[1:40:46] thaplayboy69: @Rawrther bro just go stand in darn get boon, spend 50 silver on consumables?? its not hard
[1:40:54] genjimainofc: i ducking hate supplies why is it even a thing
[1:40:56] father_ruckus_: they need to make it so you can carry more than one of them
[1:41:07] crawlthewall: why
[1:41:08] druidkittizzz: True!
[1:41:09] thaplayboy69: @Rawrther it costs less than 1 gold to do a bfd if you use consumes man
[1:41:10] linkitcraig: ashenvale mount went from honored to friendly
[1:41:15] TheEyeVII: true, nerf that shit it's for casuals anyway
[1:41:15] lizcat_: it’s just a pain in the ass in general
[1:41:24] sargent_baddy: a filled box at 25 gives 880 rep as human
[1:41:25] Lionkingler1: just a trash mechanic
[1:41:25] iBanEvader: those boxes shouldn't be unique
[1:41:26] Mertauh: the boxes were just a dumb idea they suck to this day
[1:41:41] Wadjaah: tidy____ they called it leveling raids just as a contrast to endgame raids, now what they'll do with the leveling raids after their phases are passed is still a mystery
[1:41:43] JimBobJr: @orcenheimer agreed
[1:41:56] druidkittizzz: true.
[1:41:57] iBanEvader: I think you gonna need to be revered
[1:41:58] Rawrther: i just wanna hit shit lol
[1:41:58] djbetrayer: higher level you go though the boxes give more rep
[1:42:08] Nathanew321: NODDERS honored is a rune and revered will be recipes probably
[1:42:17] Playermodd: Phase 1 took to long top finish, sod hype is dead
[1:42:19] CygnusC: plus they'll put higher level boxes in the game for more rep
[1:42:21] Utmost777: add uber exalted
[1:42:23] crawlthewall: its designed to run dry in content so people go onto Retail
[1:42:37] Frostlicious: boxes have to be the worst thing to be added
[1:42:39] tidy____: @Wadjaah You will see in a few weeks my friend what they meant with "leveling raid" even with P2 out.
[1:43:00] tidy____: @Wadjaah This will also be a compensation to everyone that done all their quests.
[1:43:08] Lionkingler1: you still have to buy the items of the AH

[2:10:26] hardknox187: it shouldnt be wishy washy as to what countries ethnicity applies to, applies to all or applies to none
[2:10:27] iBanEvader: Don't we all have a common ancestor? And we all migrated over history to all parts of the world. I think a better defition of ethnicity is when that country/nation is founded. From then on you and your children belong to that.
[2:10:29] m3xbean: Swedish people ethnicity iswhite....they have a culture...and live within a nationality lol .....

[2:10:43] carlos_the_7th: @iBanEvader that whole "we all come from Africa" is bullshit btw
[2:10:51] Atomized: @iBanEvader No.
[2:10:53] veluberu: In other words, biological racism. Sounds fine.
[2:11:01] daijahaden: @chaos_terrain There are ethnic Swedish people that: hate Sweden, are radical feminist/commies. Then there are non ethnic Swedes who really love Sweden and see themselves as part of it. Radical take, the latter type of Swede is probably better than the first for.. Sweden
[2:11:04] arieltrindade91: Why is ethnically tying white people to a land controversial but doing so with any other race is not?

[2:12:22] hardknox187: its either white bread or wheat bread, nobody cares what the white bread is made out of, just that it looks white

[2:13:53] daijahaden: @basedschizo44 That the native populations have a right to preserve their society and way of life, outside people who understand and respect that should be welcome. At least as long as they don't threaten that state.
[2:13:54] BawlmainCS2: hey im new here would you say you are high t or low t ?

[2:18:14] iBanEvader: @carlos_the_7th In other words, the “enigma” is about the evolution of Rh factor AFTER we are Homo Sapiens, not before.
[2:18:18] spike82q: in south africa were all just youtube faces'
[2:18:21] m3xbean: but jointing the general public as a group a race is easier way to target those people instead of by culture
[2:18:29] alleballesc: as someone who lives in thailand, if someone with iranian background grew up in sweden, he would call him self swedish here
[2:18:31] iBanEvader: @carlos_the_7th so we do have a common ancestor an Rh- factors evolved after that

[2:55:04] Razor9mm: I genuinely believe that if you watch Payo you have brain damage. There's nothing about his content that a normal functioning human being would find entertaining or interesting
[2:55:07] harvenius: @WubstepTTV that was kinda my point lol
[2:55:08] iSPEN97: @staysafetv i had to hop on payos stream after u said he is mentally ill and the first thing im met with is he sucking on his thumb

[2:57:26] QuestFor420: looool
[2:57:28] nishdj: @wookieenthal because staysafe is real and based and that's not conducive to a huge audience
[2:57:38] AntarcticTreaty: There are more mouthbreathers on Twitch, hence his audience is 'larger'
[2:57:38] dirbagdan: Is there new payo drama?
[2:57:38] wookieenthal: @nishdj well said
[2:57:41] iBanEvader: because you are 2nd in popularity and competition, narcissists are super jealous @StaysafeTV
[2:57:42] bigsugg: he sellsout sooo much  begs for $$$

[2:59:31] nishdj: i think your audience is unique, for example you're basically the only streamer i watch
[2:59:32] KCYON: im happy to see MadSeasonShow on twitch
[2:59:36] harvenius: @StaysafeTV he views it as a zero sum game. Any success you have, it proportionate loss for him. He's just a bitch

[3:21:47] TwoDancingLobsters: @cyonara74 a dad spending time with his child is important boom mind changed>
[3:21:48] numblezzz: @cyonara74 depends on your definition of toxic masculinity. acting like an angry ape is bad, having a logical reason to act like an ape is good
[3:21:51] seksmuhchine: who doesnt like that shit?
[3:21:51] mrwasdead: @Humansoup pretty BASED
[3:21:52] Seabrookx: He create even more degenrate men and whore women
[3:21:55] KCYON: @TwoDancingLobsters ^

[3:22:34] ziiakk_: 100% made me think
[3:22:34] KCYON: i see what you mean. balancing the scales of insanity if you will
[3:22:39] DemonicAvatar: @cyonara74 toxic masculinity is an older world. First usage was when men started to work in facilities and not at home on the far anymore and it started to be competetiv. That was called toxic
[3:22:39] Pulleft: have you seen the 3-monthly frenzy of conservatives calling patriot front feds?
[3:22:47] dirbagdan: he said he'd sleep with a dude that thinks they're a chick if they were hot
[3:22:52] rocknsake: he forces people to see something they didn't want to see or be aware of
[3:22:54] numblezzz: he is the definition of a useful idiot. he has been beneficial for the culture war, but he is a hypocritical grifter
[3:22:58] numblezzz: that exploits young men
[3:23:05] KCYON: but yeah i dont think hes good for men in general. there are too many unintelligent people for someone like Tate to have a platform
[3:23:10] dinkleminkle: to me, hes rather the defintion of based in human form
[3:23:17] Humansoup: Nope
[3:23:17] NutterCircus: Tate is at least anti-pussyboy
[3:23:26] sweatlordkush: tate likes bussy
[3:23:27] WubstepTTV: he said hed rather have sex with a trans woman than a trans man. he said its more gay to fuck a dude with a pussy than it is a chick with a dick
[3:23:31] Faramar: who do you think has had a more positive impact on the dialogue, andrew tate or lana del rey?
[3:23:33] Faramar: monkaHmm

[3:23:41] numblezzz: tate converted to islam and promotes pyramid schemes
[3:23:48] tomble_: i thought he is a sex trafficker con man
[3:23:48] RueRunsIt: the best thing about tate is he knew how to be a fighter and learned sec discipline in life. otherwise he has flaw
[3:23:59] dirbagdan: @WubstepTTV weird either way
[3:24:02] KCYON: its inevitable. therefore strengthen young men
[3:24:13] seksmuhchine: tate likes manipulation
[3:24:15] mrwasdead: @WubstepTTV tbf he said he'd rather sleep with megan fox with a package than hulk hogan with a vag
[3:24:18] KCYON: you cannot avoid pornography nowadays. even Limewire was rough
[3:24:20] numblezzz: he is a grifter
[3:24:23] dinkleminkle: You think 4Chan and Andrew Tate convey
[3:24:31] TwoDancingLobsters: @WubstepTTV interesting he values secondary sexual characteristics over the genitalia
[3:24:35] WubstepTTV: @dirbagdan not disagreeing with you there

[3:25:33] Peoplewhinetoomuch: @twodancinglobsters i would think its more about that one is a real man and the other is a real woman
[3:25:36] mizutamari93: rad
[3:25:37] numblezzz: im libertarian until im not YEP
[3:25:47] KCYON: the reason why Hentai is so weird is because of the repression of the Japanese

[3:26:06] WubstepTTV: Just dont talk about it didnt work out well for abstinence so i dont think it word with pornography either
[3:26:16] NutterCircus: There are groups of people that know and use pornography to destroy societies.
[3:26:16] DemonicAvatar: Japan has porn. Korea has banned porn
[3:26:27] dirbagdan: there would be an adjustment period or the coomers but new generations would never know its existence so it wouldnt have a negative effect only positive
[3:26:31] dirbagdan: for*
[3:26:32] numblezzz: porn should be allowed but publicly discouraged. like cigarettes
[3:26:37] TwoDancingLobsters: @Peoplewhinetoomuch I'd argue he would also have sex with a hot transwoman vs a super body hair jacked butch woman. But we would have to ask him
[3:26:42] JudicatorJake: no one watched porn 50 years ago and everything was fine
[3:26:44] A5H0J: #bringbackAlcatraz
[3:26:55] numblezzz: freedom is a fundamental tenet of the west, individuals have the right to engage in things that you deem degenerate

[3:27:33] dinkleminkle: dude i just wanna bust a nut in peace
[3:27:36] KCYON: if you must watch porn, choose a category that doesn't make you feel ashamed after, and "smoke" it periodically .
[3:27:38] seksmuhchine: i'm staysafe i hate anime tiddies
[3:27:40] peterpandam: the robots wont need to watch it
[3:27:44] wookieenthal: it takes a village

[3:27:57] rocknsake: i think certain type of porn are bad (pedo, violent, etc) but men need an outlet, it's dangerous to block a basic human need

[3:29:02] NutterCircus: We gotta go BACK EleGiggle
[3:29:03] Moondrius: Sounds like if you try to get rid of porn, then you are trying to turn society into the movie "Equilibrium".
[3:29:03] seksmuhchine: do you know what the internet was made for?
[3:29:13] wookieenthal: Sadge

[3:52:41] notadodger69: @KCYON, that's no excuse... this drug needs regulations if these people can't see that
[3:52:46] HitmandanTV: HitmandanTV subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 6 months, currently on a 1 month streak! oregon is F'd

[3:54:24] CaptainWylde: Maybe your dumbest take of all time thinking drug addicts are going to move to another state because its "easier to do drugs there". People with addiction are operating on a day to day cycle. From fix to fix, not from fucking coast to coast dude. This is not a thing. No offense man but you spout a whole lot of advice for a dude whose been locked into wow for 80 hours a week. Like you actually have a fucking ear to the ground in any city

[3:55:38] notadodger69: @WubstepTTV, no honey all of it needs to be scheduled way higher, no treatment is worth letting these people use in the streets to spread disease, and social corruption
[3:55:40] CaptainWylde: No lmao
[3:55:42] goodstuffg: LA specifically
[3:55:42] KCYON: its dumb to think all drug addicts are completely brainless. they're severely addicted. not 100% stupid
[3:55:48] CaptainWylde: Easier?

[3:56:57] notadodger69: @WubstepTTV, you couldn't disagree
[3:56:59] DuoX: panhandle for like 4 hours and buy a greyhound ticket
[3:57:00] HitmandanTV: Homeless walk or get free rides to wherever they are going
[3:57:03] zaria_dh: what are those train hoppers called again
[3:57:05] King_Joymonger: I'm left leaning politically but everything you've said is fact. I think there are methods to in fact fix it, but the responsibility won't be laid at the right people's feet, and it will basicly rely on charity for other's to do what 'they want', which is wrong.
[3:57:10] HitmandanTV: or the state moves them
[3:57:13] seksmuhchine: @xxbuzx yeah macdoug bought boeing

[3:57:24] americanbornchild: FBtouchdown
[3:57:28] kirk_hunts: I think Miami to PNW is the most extreme example. The fact is that from just neighboring states there is a large migration of people looking to abuse these new policies
[3:57:28] alec_in_chains: As someone who lived in the Seattle/Tacoma area from 2007-2019, I can emphatically say that it was and is absolutely infested with drug addicts. I was one myself years ago and was embedded in the groups of homeless people who infest the area. It's not a non-issue whatsoever.
[3:57:30] drencro: just to avoid legal issues alone people would make that move
[3:57:30] CaptainWylde: This whole stream is turning into that incel podcasy you got featured on

[3:57:39] snake_like: crackhead hears "heroin is decriminalized"  or "it's way easier to get your fix daily in x state" - how the fuck is that hard to understand? do you think addicts can't move?
[3:57:42] mrwasdead: @StaysafeTV hear me out, move to portland, get addicted to opiates, become homeless, ruin my life and live off government assistance forever and never be able to live independently from the system :)
[3:57:50] cheesepaper2: lol been pvping for over an hour and havent commented on it

[3:58:24] dirbagdan: @CaptainWylde POOGERS
[3:58:25] NutterCircus: If the sign said you need to get out of their town, prob easy.
[3:58:27] mr_tossursalad: can also offer the pilot's head
[3:58:28] Xuranus83: the local gov in tx will probably give you a free one way ticket
[3:58:28] jDante1: a lot, I see them doing it in Austin every day
[3:58:30] Randomguy_360: I knew a panhandler that had a home and a motorcycle, he said it paid him more than his job on some days

[3:58:35] Randomguy_360: he just faked illness
[3:58:39] ottobot2: this guy would argue people do not switch states because of the different ways in which they governed. lmao. It happens all the time.
[3:58:41] unscconnor2: @CaptainWylde such a little bitch you cant even respond to me
[3:58:47] americanbornchild: 20 dollar Chinese Bus
[3:58:48] iBanEvader: public transport is for poor people

[3:58:58] KCYON: i miss public transport a bit
[3:59:00] TheDirtyNunchucks: Southpark made an episode of them bussing homeless people to CA. Sad but true.

[3:59:27] Wrettchh: @CaptainWylde you earned it

[3:59:30] LiamMega: west hills KEKW
[3:59:31] KCYON: @CaptainWylde alright boys hug it out <3
[3:59:35] unscconnor2: @CaptainWylde yeah i did, make a solid argument now "bud"
[3:59:39] HitmandanTV: Switch subjects you obviously dont know how cheap it is to move around
[3:59:40] notadodger69: being honest is aggression
[3:59:43] notadodger69: you're the bad guy
[3:59:44] Peoplewhinetoomuch: @captainwylde hey if the shoe fits.
[3:59:48] notadodger69: you would be the enemy to them
[3:59:48] CaptainWylde: Oh no i disagreed with your streamer, im retarded got it lol

[4:00:05] notadodger69: sex trafficking, drug trafficking
[4:00:06] KCYON: its super sad though
[4:00:08] dirbagdan: Nobody acknowledges it whatsoever
[4:00:14] jaynkumz: @CaptainWylde you made up a reality, you didn't disagree
[4:00:15] TheDirtyNunchucks: schrodinger's homeless
[4:00:16] notadodger69: Portland is Gotham
[4:00:17] Wrettchh: @CaptainWylde no you're retarded bc you keep saying retarded shit
[4:00:22] kirk_hunts: lol this stream will be a tutorial for "How to enrage your chat 101"
[4:00:23] tomble_: @CaptainWylde these chatters are cray cray bruva
[4:00:24] Mind_G0bl1n: its like a different layer
[4:00:26] 1Horsepower: Im from the mean streets of Beaverton OR. Barely made it out. Growing up there is a daily game of life and death, you never know when an opp might catch you slipping.
[4:00:27] snake_like: idk they just sound delusional. I have some liberal leanings and can see what's in front of me
[4:00:31] CaptainWylde: @madjacker15 weird it was just stated as an absolute fact
[4:00:34] notadodger69: Portland is Gotham City it's so trash
[4:00:37] dirbagdan: and the government just decrimnilizes more shit so people can do cocaine now and in some cases buy it
[4:00:41] seksmuhchine: same thing happening all along the west coast
[4:00:43] zaria_dh: my great grandma was like that with the holocaust she wouldnt believe that ever happened
[4:00:46] iBanEvader: I think a lot of deniers are pro-drugs/marijuana people
[4:00:57] americanbornchild: CaitlynS
[4:00:58] notadodger69: but to say that these zones wouldn't breed disease ad crime

[4:01:11] Mind_G0bl1n: "meters" monkaW
[4:01:12] alec_in_chains: Man, 3rd and Yessler was/is insane. I worked downtown for a year before moving to the East Coast and it sucked having to walk to the Sounder train station from my office.
[4:01:13] KCYON: what i hope will happen is bigger cities become smaller and people return to nature slowly in smaller towns.
[4:01:22] werebearsuh: the guy disagreeing doesn’t realize their aspiration to freely get their fix is priceless in their mind. these people will do whatever it takes unfortunately.
[4:01:22] CaptainWylde: Dude things people with hardcore drug addictions are just taking peter pans for easier drug laws. Like an addict gives a fuck about the law.
[4:01:30] iBanEvader: @notadodger69 it's fucking hilarious how the US keeps experimenting on it's own people

[4:01:57] AntarcticTreaty: @zaria_dh same bro, I couldn't believe they had the capacity to process 6 million bodies, but turns out they could because the establishment elites said so Peggers

[4:06:13] King_Joymonger: and night chat
[4:06:17] King_Joymonger: o7
[4:06:27] KCYON: im sure if peoples countries were safe and livable they would not leave. Colonizers kinda screwed themselves over by stealing resources 200 years ago, immigration is a "tax" for that action if you will
[4:06:27] Synmachus: @King_Joymonger gn sstvLOVE

[4:07:06] Mind_G0bl1n: @brushbro then go to ukraine?
[4:07:09] saund: Yeah prioritising the safety of your own countries citizens is now seen as hateful
[4:07:10] smurf1g: fascist is when government and corporation is all one, kind of what we have in the US
[4:07:17] Eat_a_Cow: fascism would be an upgrade to whatever this is
[4:07:21] nobunagaopa3: no, thats a braindead take
[4:07:29] dirbagdan: because people have been conditioned to believe the multiculturalism is a good thing and we should strive towards it when the exact opposite is true
[4:07:33] iBanEvader: also true yea
[4:07:37] nobunagaopa3: actually, lmao - nato does not create land disputes by enforcing sovereignty
[4:07:37] KCYON: @MadJacker15 ^
[4:07:39] cyonara74: i want doctors and professors to immigrate here.  not people that will be a burden to tax payers.
[4:07:45] nobunagaopa3: dog shit takew
[4:07:50] Berg1642: the disputes of land in eastern europe is basicly russia claiming lebensraum
[4:08:00] dirbagdan: @cyonara74 id rather not tbh. I want a doctor that looks like me
[4:08:06] notjyordan: I'm from Scotland and without the waves of immigrants we wouldn't have the amazing health care that we have
[4:08:08] NutterCircus: Just let them settle their own problems.
[4:08:17] NicoriousBIG: MAGA?
[4:08:17] pickledic: wrong
[4:08:19] drencro: magical thinking to reasonably expect blood libels make sense'
[4:08:25] cyonara74: america first
[4:08:26] mrwasdead: what if they just split the holy site in half with some paint?
[4:08:29] pickledic: WRONG
[4:08:31] KCYON: @dirbagdan in all honesty, it doesnt matter objectively as their medical degrees arent valid in a new country. You want good people over useful
[4:08:31] nobunagaopa3: you dont have that privilege after 30 years of fucking ignoring your own issues and claiming hegemony, its horrnedous
[4:08:36] handovdoom666: will never happen

[4:09:07] ottobot2: the suffering must continue
[4:09:07] nobunagaopa3: no you fix the mistakes in the proper context
[4:09:08] TurboBased: never correct
[4:09:09] uzisd4: Do you have a specific design example of an effective wall ? If so bust out the paint for us
[4:09:12] NutterCircus: US Needs to take care of their OWN.
[4:09:14] pickledic: America has no issues, there are way bigger issues in the world that take priority over what happens inside
[4:09:14] TurboBased: KEKW
[4:09:15] dirbagdan: @KCYON I want my own people. I don't want any immigrants. We should populate our countried from within

[4:09:36] Timmyjk: Imagine what China, Russia, etc would do if USA disband NATO
[4:09:38] unscconnor2: NATO only exists so pussy ass EU nations can suck off our military
[4:09:39] iBanEvader: @nobunagaopa3 I wasn't only talking about NATO but the west in general
[4:09:42] Eat_a_Cow: Disband NATO and UN
[4:09:44] andyjamesgames: Sorry not sorry, Europe. But we’re gunna take sometime to… MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN…we’ll get back to you after that happens Kappa
[4:09:44] handovdoom666: it'll never happen and here's three words because of it: defense contractors lobbyists
[4:09:49] jonisyntinen: FACT
[4:09:52] KCYON: @dirbagdan that is your opinion and you are free to have it. I would recommend cities where you would feel comfortable, and to leave "other people" alone
[4:09:52] Stemaab: 1000%%%%%%

[4:15:34] ottobot2: it turns out if a country wants to be a democracy they will rise up themselves. its happened many many times. they dont need the US
[4:15:35] dirbagdan: @KCYON and many people misunderstand me. I'm not racist, I just don't believe that immigration should be a thing. People should remain in their own borders. We'd have a more stable world with better international relationships without it. Cohesive social structures built on the same values can't be possible with multiculturalism.
[4:15:39] brushbro: maybe cause NATO

[4:17:00] cafemikey: john cena knows what to do its pretty obv no one can see him
[4:17:03] iBanEvader: there's way too much resistance of the European civilians if Russia even conquers those countries

[4:24:49] KCYON: @Tyndelmp that was decades ago, though
[4:24:55] Xuranus83: our involvement in vietnam was similiar to the spanish american war we thought they blew up one of our ships.
[4:25:35] Snaketrap: monkaHmm didn't we waste the most money in Vietnam? they beat us with booby traps
[4:25:37] Movu: And aiding Ukraine is the cheapest dollar for dollar we get on stopping communism. You don't think Russia is still a threat to the USA?
[4:25:38] re5onxnce: USA doesn't lose they stop killing.

[4:28:20] unscconnor2: the idea of drafting young american men to fight in vietnam just 15-20 years after ww2 was heavily unpopular @StaysafeTV

[4:30:01] AceOfFlame: Nazi lost the second he invaded russia, it was a massive down hill
[4:30:02] seksmuhchine: yeah

[4:30:11] andyjamesgames: sstvWAT
[4:30:11] KCYON: its quite a serious comment
[4:30:14] ottobot2: capitalism is the meta for sure. The technology that comes out of them is decades ahead of communist nations.
[4:30:18] Movu: Thinking we shouldn't have Europe in WW2 is just insane, wow
[4:30:19] andyjamesgames: sstvWAT sstvWAT sstvWAT
[4:30:21] FD1793: the russians in germany after WW2 aware
[4:30:22] Snaketrap: monkaHmm we did wait a pretty long time

[4:30:34] MawblesPDX: How are the rep gains going tonight
[4:30:34] NutterCircus: We could just fund both sides and make shekels EleGiggle
[4:30:35] carlos_the_7th: @KCYON not at all, it's common sense.. let both enemies fight and defeat what's left
[4:30:42] HashbrownsTV: agreed, we need to stop funding war. MERICA BABY KKomrade
[4:30:43] pizzadad212: Russian population got crushed though didn’t it
[4:30:43] Zilogisu: Terrible take
[4:30:47] smurf1g: Russia would've won anyway, would've taken longer though
[4:30:47] AntarcticTreaty: @wagyu_88 what happened at Auschwitz?
[4:30:49] iBanEvader: @StaysafeTV the most important fight for America in the world is the Red Sea atm. It fucks over the whole western economy.
[4:30:52] Timmyjk: That's a risky thing
[4:30:53] Pimplejewce: The offer of inheriting the British empire was too temping for the americans
[4:30:56] seksmuhchine: let the nazis take the east
[4:31:00] jonisyntinen: ”We defeated the wrong enemy” - George S.Patton @staysafetv
[4:31:01] HashbrownsTV: CAUSE AMERICA LOVES WAR = MONEY.
[4:31:01] Mind_G0bl1n: communists were easier to defeat than a full fledged nationalist germany
[4:31:03] Jessrabbit1: I don't think the US would've taken the nazis alone, their army at the time was nothing like the germans
[4:31:03] mikey9988: star surge seems pretty balanced compared to arcane surge
[4:31:05] NeelyAE08: Werent the nazis pretty close to nukes
[4:31:05] Diet_Coke_Dude: what's a couple more hundred thousand Jews dying...
[4:31:05] ottobot2: japan fucked up by attacking u in WW@
[4:31:08] AceOfFlame: @pizzadad212 yes but it was more like a roman thing, lose a bunch of men but won the won
[4:31:10] Pimplejewce: The British are so sneaky lol
[4:31:13] smurf1g: because USSR would've won anyways, just took them longer
[4:31:15] Fladius: If global democracy dies global economy will suffer, you'll have to trade with many China's fearing they have alternative motives than just trade
[4:31:16] zoulour21: South Europe is against Nazis and Russia... you helped mostly South European with war
[4:31:17] wagyu_88: @AntarcticTreaty  Read the book writen by Dr Miclos
[4:31:18] Zilogisu: More innocents would have died
[4:31:19] KCYON: @carlos_the_7th common sense is not always the best decision , as crazy as that may sound. I speak from empathy here
[4:31:33] Movu: Because without our intervention Europe and the UK would have fallen? This is an insane take man
[4:31:38] KCYON: @KCYON stability can be better than victory
[4:31:39] carlos_the_7th: @KCYON empathy means nothing against facts
[4:31:42] Tyndelmp: The russians declared war on Japan a few days before the end of the war so they could claim to some of their territory.
[4:31:42] mrwasdead: hitler was destined to lose
[4:31:47] Wrettchh: if we could have guaranteed we could come "clean the rest up" i agree, but i dont know shit about shit
[4:31:51] Mikasa1337x: USSR whould have won without Normandy assault
[4:31:54] Zilogisu: More innocent people would have died
[4:31:58] iBanEvader: the nazis didn't have any oil supplies
[4:31:59] pizzadad212: @aceofflame ya good point, seems like the population recovered
[4:32:01] Jessrabbit1: they were developping an atomic bomb as well brother
[4:32:04] iBanEvader: that's why they invaded russia
[4:32:10] Mind_G0bl1n: so u just wanted them to both fight more but russia still win?
[4:32:12] KCYON: If I can win and kill 50 million people, versus draw and kill 10 million people, i choose draw
[4:32:19] seksmuhchine: because of leand-lease
[4:32:32] Mikasa1337x: US and UK just had FOMO about russians winning the war sololy
[4:32:38] smurf1g: isnt that what we did genrally? LUL
[4:32:42] Lionkingler1: 100% the right call
[4:32:45] pizzadad212: did we see the Russians as that big of enemies at the time? im not a history buff
[4:33:04] ajunta__: do you think if it was just Russia and German it could be a Ukraine / russia thing but way worse in the 40s ?
[4:33:04] Mind_G0bl1n: imo US played that pretty well and came out on top in the best way
[4:33:10] iBanEvader: @StaysafeTV dictators will never stop. WW2 would've solved itself just like Napoleon
[4:33:13] HashbrownsTV: america will intervene and fund anyone who wants to engage into war. we never shy away from money for weapons.
[4:33:14] KCYON: pepoG
[4:33:17] re5onxnce: Shout out to Canada
[4:33:19] drencro: because with the increased capacuties of a conquered russia it is likely nazi germany would have won is a common argument
[4:33:20] smurf1g: because embargo
[4:33:21] zoulour21: UK, FRA and GRE are the only real friendly nations to US
[4:33:24] highony0u: they had to
[4:33:25] PazokiTV: oil embargo
[4:33:31] Zilogisu: Agree with not funding Russia, but letting Germans exist any longer than we did would be terrible
[4:33:31] seksmuhchine: russia would have thrown enough bodies
[4:33:35] theNizzmo: cause America put massive sanctions on their oil
[4:33:39] Snaketrap: always the oil jokrdOiler
[4:33:49] WubstepTTV: is it true taht they tried to surrender but we nuked em anyway?
[4:34:02] iBanEvader: @StaysafeTV Dictators will never stop waging war, they don't know their limits. Hitler was fucking around in Africa also for some reason... WW2 would've solved itself just like Napoleon
[4:34:09] ivox_8k: never

[4:34:27] Tyndelmp: They thought we didn't have the will to rebuild after pearl harbor America was very isolationist before ww2.
[4:34:30] HashbrownsTV: AMERICA ARE #1 PUBLIC ENEMY
[4:34:31] iBanEvader: America blocked important trades from the Japanese in the Pacific @StaysafeTV
[4:34:34] KCYON: if you consider yourself first, your priority always comes first. hence wars
[4:34:38] smurf1g: should've invaded Japan sooner, would've had PS10 by now
[4:34:41] iBanEvader: that's why the Japanese attacked pearl harbour

[4:45:11] 1Horsepower: That ship has sailed, Germany should look towards colonizing the moon if they need more space
[4:45:20] drunk_hunk: hungary said fuck no

[4:46:13] Leffeegw: In sweden we give them more mo
[4:46:16] Leffeegw: money
[4:46:16] ivox_8k: your wife can vote in germany while in the us?
[4:46:17] smurf1g: Is Biden planning to die in the oval office?
[4:46:18] Leffeegw: instead
[4:46:19] ticeyx: how the fuck givin that chance to stay in Denmark do you not try and actually fuck that up
[4:46:23] harvenius: Multi ethnic works, multi cultural seems problematic. Melting pot melted

[4:46:53] AntarcticTreaty: I bet most of those Danish 'refugees' just went to the UK, the island has no borders
[4:46:55] seksmuhchine: depends on the state
[4:47:05] KingIngeborg: we have Postal voting in germany
[4:47:09] 1Horsepower: I voted for Biden 350 times via absentee ballot last election

[4:47:37] smurf1g: my mom actually voted twice last election, in person and by mail which is insane LUL
[4:47:43] ivox_8k: do you know about super votes and mega votes? a mega vote is worth 1000 votes etc.
[4:47:47] drencro: you could almost say after a while people get sick of being told uncontrolled immigration is not an issue when it is
[4:48:00] mundanesickle: need a federal holiday for voting
[4:48:02] brak_cornland: not everyone is free to vote in person
[4:48:03] cyonara74: I don't trust mail in voting
[4:48:04] devvastate: I'm all for america and voting. But honestly you should be able to vote from your phone. It's fkn 2024. literally no reason with all the technology
[4:48:04] Shuttlelol: @smurf1g you can do that but only one will count
[4:48:12] chiief: @smurf1g weird snitch since that's actually illegal
[4:48:12] wtfbbqsauce: Ever heard the phrase "if you don't got nothing to say don't say it at all." ? So you are either dumb or too young to know better
[4:48:14] Xuranus83: lesser of two evils
[4:48:14] moffz0r: TRUMP TRUMP TRUMP
[4:48:16] blozham: MUGA
[4:48:17] ivox_8k: absurd
[4:48:19] brak_cornland: I’d agree with in person if it was a national holiday
[4:48:24] smurf1g: @Shuttlelol no, by mail they dont know who is voting, no name no nothing
[4:48:24] OrganikCum: that's how you get 81 million votes
[4:48:25] AceOfFlame: thats fucked
[4:48:27] wtfbbqsauce: Nothing nice*

[4:49:03] kiwifruit007: What happened with desantis
[4:49:03] powmiaofficial: gd clownshow
[4:49:04] ivox_8k: probably not then
[4:49:06] devvastate: I casted my dead vote last election.
[4:49:06] ottobot2: its not like that here in texas. they check your id
[4:49:07] 1Horsepower: professional gooning league
[4:49:07] Eat_a_Cow: @Mawshaw TV told me its legit goym
[4:49:08] tacklenfuel: pro golf
[4:49:11] harvenius: surely your name/id etc is on the ballot so you cant multi vote?
[4:49:12] ripinchatwastaken: @brak_cornland why isnt it a national holiday? or even weekend!
[4:49:17] ivox_8k: NOT pro golf
[4:49:18] ivox_8k: lol
[4:49:20] kiwifruit007: What happened with desantis .
[4:49:22] smurf1g: @Shuttlelol they only name they get is on the envelope
[4:49:33] smurf1g: @Shuttlelol i guess
[4:49:33] AceOfFlame: If trump wins, is he allowed to do 2 terms given he already done 1 term? I know their unspoken rule about 2 terms only
[4:49:33] seksmuhchine: need to have a picture of your signature
[4:49:35] Adrenalinefl: players game league
[4:49:37] cyonara74: Id and in person voting only
[4:49:41] seksmuhchine: on file
[4:49:44] Vigo__M: And they want you to believe democracy is serious
[4:49:52] tacklenfuel: lmao i fell on that one
[4:49:55] ivox_8k: perfect guy life
[4:50:06] PazokiTV: they claim needing an ID to vote is racist LUL
[4:50:07] ivox_8k: pgl
[4:50:18] Xuranus83: in texas when i voted in person they check your id. when you cast your ballot its electronic but it prints the ballot so you can check what you selected an then you feed it into a scanner that is attached to a lock box. so theres essentially 3 copies.
[4:50:25] mrwasdead: all you gotta do is just sign your name no?
[4:50:29] Wrettchh: "if voting mattered they wouldn't let us do it"
[4:50:31] PazokiTV: true
[4:50:32] OrganikCum: well blacks dont have an id right?
[4:50:33] Tyndelmp: @PazokiTV bigotry of low expectations.

[4:51:01] tacklenfuel: @TheBerret bummer brobro
[4:51:04] pretty_cool_guy: OMEGALUL
[4:51:06] Xuranus83: you need an ID to get welfare
[4:51:14] TrustNoOneTV: how do they drive or get job
[4:51:17] Leffeegw: How is it hard to get a ID?
[4:51:24] seksmuhchine: nah not racist just hate poors
[4:51:31] mundanesickle: There is allegedly testimony that the electronic voting systems have the capacity to flip votes 51/49 in an untraceable manner
[4:51:36] iBanEvader: we really still live in the medieval ages
[4:51:39] Xuranus83: state id free
[4:51:42] 1Horsepower: @TheBerret damn that sucks, you should replace it with a cybertruck
[4:51:45] OPproductionzz: classism
[4:51:52] seksmuhchine: nope
[4:51:53] devvastate: As someone i've literally been in a district that was gerrymandered, and then had my polling location changed last election in a bid to obviously make it harder to vote. I literally stood in line for over an hour. I can see the devils advocate argument that we should idneed making voteing easier. There is no reason not to in 2024 with all the technology and verification technology.
[4:51:55] smurf1g: dont need to be a citizen to get the id
[4:52:00] seksmuhchine: not free
[4:52:00] Leffeegw: So it just means that they are Lazy?
[4:52:03] grossghost: you can just renew online too I don't even remember the last time I actually went in to get my picture taken for my id
[4:52:10] Harles_: @smurf1g thats wrong
[4:52:16] pretty_cool_guy: it's literally fundamental legislation. that's nuts
[4:52:24] smurf1g: @Harles_ not wrong, google it
[4:52:31] cineelite: State ID's DO cost money where I live
[4:52:31] blozham: but if you're not working how are you supposed to have the time to go and collect an ID
[4:52:32] pathUwU: don't have time to pick up their ID between doordash deliveries 😔
[4:52:44] nerunehru: if you don't have documents its very difficult to get an ID actually. Poor people are not likely to have stuff like birth certificates and whatnot because their parents were incompetent
[4:52:45] hiStatue: triggers all the memories when everyone called you nazi
[4:52:54] smurf1g: in NYC, if you come here as student or whatever and get an id easy including driver licence
[4:52:58] hiStatue: no way 1 645 is watching this, viewbot for sure
[4:53:09] platypiguy1: that’s places like Washington with a lot of illegals, exactly
[4:53:15] nassera123: Well.. nothing is criminal in Oregon anymore
[4:53:18] Vigo__M: HUH
[4:53:21] imradioaktive: MrDestructoid
[4:53:23] re5onxnce: if you are too lazy to get an id you shouldn't vote
[4:53:24] ottobot2: state id just needs ssn, and proof of residency in the state.
[4:53:29] pretty_cool_guy: HAHAHAHAHAHAHA
[4:53:29] ivox_8k: i am a viewbot MrDestructoid

[5:30:11] NooleanB: You'd prefer Chinese world police?
[5:30:22] BinksMagnus: what's your take on the Yemen/Houthi situation? generally non-interventionist, but America's earliest wars were done in the name of maritime trade freedom
[5:30:36] General_TrollZ: please send mr streamer some subs im broke but still love this guy
[5:30:46] gigera6653: @ivox_8k the moon, have you ever heard of it

[5:31:46] pootereater: BASED
[5:31:52] bastianCx: Yemen has been close to a humanitarian disaster for a very long time. There's war crimes committed by the Saudi there too, with US Support as well
[5:32:25] pyro_lurkz: @StaysafeTV  But don't you think if we were to back out from aiding Israel they would resort to using nukes?
[5:32:35] General_TrollZ: Iran was attacking US targets since the 80s though
[5:32:58] racerkill: what percent of wsgs are you winning?
[5:32:58] Boomie1995: What does USA get out of the relationship with Israel? Why does USA maintain it currently?
[5:33:04] General_TrollZ: before it was helping to the super corrupt shaa and this was one of the reason they dont like USA there
[5:33:27] bastianCx: no
[5:33:30] JohnTannen: nukes are fake and gay
[5:33:34] sighwarlock: NOPERS
[5:33:39] BinksMagnus: perhaps as a very last resort, but that would require basically every arab nation to attack them at the same time
[5:33:49] griffyuhndor: sounds like a chewy threat
[5:34:04] difer_q: if you use nuke you will get nuked eventually
[5:34:32] tacklenfuel: the generation that set nukes off are dieing... thats the problem right there

[5:35:33] Fuxtic_Actual: yeah but that crazy gf gives us unlimited BJs
[5:35:34] BinksMagnus: i think pretty much any nuclear power would let them fly if they were faced with annihilation, but short of that doubtful
