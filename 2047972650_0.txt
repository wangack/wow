[4:58:57] Bakes00: mans tracking every ability in the game with that omnibar

[5:00:44] bawscal: SP swap
[5:00:45] Somanie: @knaxxis yeah I'd def say classic is very slow paced and immersive compared to retail (little more fast paced, plus inflation, etc)
[5:00:46] stickywoods: looks fun
[5:01:08] Somemodsaretools: this is the shit that got me into DF lol
[5:01:10] azliaris1: it's too much info if youre too used to classic's walking simulator pace

[5:01:22] JohnSpecter: badman3GunDanceLarry badman3GunDanceLarry badman3GunDanceLarry
[5:01:36] Knaxxis: @Somanie  so for classic pvp is a side game not a main focus really right? where dragonflight aka retail. they caree about pvp and pve the same so its just much more flushed out and def less socual but more rewarding
[5:01:41] Somanie: Classic is also just classic, meaning it's not a constant gear grind, which is how retail can feel
[5:01:42] Sickology514: bonk
[5:02:11] occupiedjapan: this is not easy like classic with only frostbolts
[5:02:17] Knaxxis: i mena ppl r chasing bis from kt or whatever for years
[5:02:23] Somanie: No seasons or updates or big patches or class changes, you're just 60
[5:02:27] Knaxxis: or chasing dft or nelths tear fro years
[5:02:38] azliaris1: you can be done with pvp bis from only doing pvp in literally 1 day
[5:02:44] kusoneko: @Somanie you can get bis in like 1 day in retail
[5:02:45] azliaris1: how is that even close to being bad lol
[5:02:53] walozdle: last time i really felt "done" with gear was back in legion, wild having that feeling again in SoD
[5:03:02] Knaxxis: classic andy's r classic andy's to them no other version of wow can be good
[5:03:14] DdyLoo: ^
[5:03:17] Knaxxis: they just wont accept that classic isnt as good as retail
[5:03:17] azliaris1: you can farm MC for perd blade for weeks and never see it
[5:03:27] azliaris1: meanwhile i go to vendor and press buy dagger
[5:03:46] DdyLoo: @Knaxxis you already said they are different. So you cant really compare and say one is better lol
[5:03:53] Somanie: @kusoneko I called retail a "gear grind" bc of the constant updates and m+ seasons (as well as raids). My b KEKW I didn't mean it was necessarily hard to gear in retail
[5:03:56] AnnxxR: @Knaxxis ofc classic is better than retail, just look at the facts
[5:04:10] Knaxxis: @DdyLoo  i didnt say one was i said one wasnnt as good
[5:04:15] Knaxxis: one was better*
[5:04:28] DdyLoo: Knaxxis: ^ satupid question 7-Month Subscriber (6-Month Badge)TurboKnaxxis: stupid* can't compare them 7-Month Subscriber (6-Month Badge)TurboKnaxxis: nto the same game
[5:04:40] DdyLoo: @Knaxxis lol
[5:04:41] Sickology514: do you guys think i can use ai to write my eval at work, i hate this shit
[5:04:47] walozdle: hot take, but retail and raiding are in some of the best shape ever rn, but m+ is a cancer to the game overall
[5:04:50] AnnxxR: unless u mean classic recycle ofc
[5:04:51] Somanie: I don't feel like this should be a >:( moment u guyssss
[5:05:02] snowman56: While you CAN compare classic to retail, it's sort of a moot point. The reality is you're speaking to two entirely different demographics who want to play their respective game.
[5:05:09] DdyLoo: both games are fun and bad in their own way. thats just it
[5:05:25] Knaxxis: classic is good in it's own way but the QoL features retail has and just the sheer size of the game - make it compeltely different
[5:05:31] Somanie: @sickology514 look up a template or guide for one and yoink some of the same verbiage out of it
[5:05:39] kusoneko: classic is for washed up boomers, retail is for washed up boomers.
[5:05:48] Sickology514: smort
[5:05:56] derleonidas: @kusoneko hahaha true
[5:06:00] ImShmoly: cc is for plebs

[5:06:06] BigDP: your gear is shita
[5:06:10] Knaxxis: being edgy in twitch chat is also for washed up boomers lol
[5:06:14] Somanie: @walozdle I'd call m+ more of like a mild flu. It has its shitty moments, but it isn't that bad, ESP if you have a good guild team cooking with you
[5:06:16] TheGamingBoar: chat is occupied fighting a damn civil war over here
[5:06:29] DdyLoo: i dont think anyone actually knows what a boomer is xD a real boomer dont even know what wow is xD
[5:06:30] AnnxxR: the actual vanilla game at its time was insanely good
[5:06:38] Knaxxis: seems liek we r having a decent discussion tbh
[5:06:43] Somanie: Both games are so good though yall
[5:06:48] Somanie: For different reaskns
[5:06:49] DdyLoo: ^
[5:06:52] Somanie: And different mooooods
[5:06:53] Knaxxis: ^
[5:07:00] Knaxxis: thats treu thats pretty true its true
[5:07:11] azliaris1: classic andys not wanting even basic QOL is really cringe though
[5:07:12] bakerpls: i like turtles
[5:07:22] azliaris1: like why does 1hr mail between alts exist?
[5:07:24] bakerpls: is what i hear when i read chat rn
[5:07:25] Knaxxis: i mena im glad they banned gdkp's from phase 2
[5:07:29] fatgirlsxxl: Warrior is screaming irl atm
[5:07:32] Knaxxis: pay to win is fucking creinge
[5:07:53] AnnxxR: banning gdkp is  classic blizzard move
[5:07:56] dickman911: anyone that tries to play both retail and classic is gonna have all the twitch fanboys from both sides and everybody in between clogging chat with the same repetitive arguments over and over
[5:07:58] AnnxxR: instead of fixing the probelm
[5:07:59] Somanie: Tbh the thing I love most about retail when comparing it to classic are some of the quality of life features
[5:08:15] DdyLoo: @dickman911 thats why i play both and laugh at these people xD
[5:08:16] walozdle: @Somanie i can see that, i don't think it'd be near as bad if m+ didnt start till 3 or so weeks into the season; it's those first few weeks where if you're a mythic raider you need to be doing 100's of runs
[5:08:47] bakerpls: when i play retail i hate that i only care about tmog and mounts. i dont even play the game
[5:08:59] Knaxxis: @AnnxxR  all gdkp's do is futher the gold buying and the botting and all that it s a genuine L for the game - it destroyed Wrath and it has destroyed era as well - the only ppl in favor of them r ppl who buy gold
[5:09:02] Knaxxis: period.
[5:09:08] Somanie: @walozdle yeah :/ esp if you want to do higher difficulty raiding, then it feels like a grind haha
[5:09:24] TheGamingBoar: actually pumped that round!
[5:09:31] AshlolTV: sp is immortal i swear
[5:09:36] fatgirlsxxl: yea dickflight is just spam pve
[5:09:42] AnnxxR: @Knaxxis trading gold for items is a core feature of mmos though and has been in it since the beginning
[5:09:43] kusoneko: YES. too much cc and set up, just do big dam
[5:09:59] DdyLoo: @AnnxxR that is the most awful take xD buying gold is awful. stop
[5:10:01] Knaxxis: @AnnxxR ur tip toeing an du know it
[5:10:07] Knaxxis: terrible take
[5:10:10] walozdle: @Knaxxis preach. the the amount of gdkp apologists coming out of the woodwork rn is nuts
[5:10:16] Knaxxis: trading and buying items r not the same lol
[5:10:17] shadowthehedgehog97: how are the numbers so high already lol. didnt they reset all this in shadowlands
[5:10:39] Knaxxis: thats lame as f
[5:10:40] AnnxxR: @DdyLoo the one thing has nothing to do with the other
[5:10:40] DdyLoo: anyone defending buying gold, is a big part of the problem lol
[5:10:43] azliaris1: it's been easy to expose all the gold buyers recently
[5:10:49] azliaris1: go to offical sod forums
[5:10:52] Somanie: 👀 monkaTOS
[5:11:04] azliaris1: it's FULL of whiners crying that their gdkp was "Ethical"
[5:11:17] azliaris1: noooo it's all farmed gold not bought at all
[5:11:26] Knaxxis: @Somanie  did i lie tho?
[5:11:26] AnnxxR: even back in vanilla wow 2005 people would buy gold
[5:11:37] azliaris1: doesnt make it right though
[5:11:39] DdyLoo: @AnnxxR cool. that dont make it a good thing
[5:11:50] Somanie: @knaxxis nah just didn't want the link in the chattuh
[5:11:52] AnnxxR: thats why they should limit the possibilty of gold buying
[5:12:05] Knaxxis: ppl barely bought gold back in vanilla and even in classic it wasnt as common as it is now
[5:12:08] azliaris1: banning gdkps does that
[5:12:09] azliaris1: lol
[5:12:16] Knaxxis: it has literally ruined classic and if u dont think so ur an idiot
[5:12:26] kusoneko: PUMP
[5:12:28] AnnxxR: @Knaxxis it was common
[5:12:29] Somanie: Would gdkp die off if more people joined/made raiding guilds monkaHmm
[5:12:33] millinoid: klepter is pumping
[5:12:44] Knaxxis: @Somanie  yes it would ebcause u dont have gdkp's in retail
[5:12:47] DdyLoo: buying gold has ruined most of pve for wow period lol. you get these people in high gear score that dont know shit about anything lol
[5:12:48] Knaxxis: at all
[5:12:59] bakerpls: my biggest problem with wow in general is that my friends who still play are worse than actual bots. feels like single player :(
[5:13:04] Knaxxis: ppl sell carries and shit in retail but gdkp's dont exist
[5:13:25] tic1993: 4 set andy
[5:13:26] AnnxxR: in vanilla classic gdkps were in a decent spot... most people were raiding in guilds but u could also do some gdkps here and there
[5:13:49] Somanie: I feel like gdkp is better than selling the runs :/
[5:13:57] Knaxxis: i played in 2004 and literally no one bought gold or did gdkp's then
[5:14:00] AnnxxR: people still bought gold to buy consumables etc
[5:14:00] Somanie: Hopefully that's not a dogshit take KEKW
[5:14:04] klikka: @Ziqoftw glad to see you back on retail :)
[5:14:05] Knaxxis: gdkp's didnt become a thing till like wrath
[5:14:14] AnnxxR: @Knaxxis weird because I did play aswell in 2005 and tons of my friends would buy gold
[5:14:17] DdyLoo: @Somanie to be fair i think both is bad so not a bad take lol
[5:14:19] ImShmoly: gl doing gdkps in mythic raids, its way too hard compared to classic raiding
[5:14:21] cockowner: @bakerpls find gamers friends EZ
[5:14:24] Knaxxis: @AnnxxR  thats just not true
[5:14:26] ImShmoly: thats why people sell boosts
[5:14:44] DdyLoo: @Knaxxis people have always bought gold lol. Its just now blizzard sells it so its way worse
[5:14:48] Knaxxis: gdkp['s r better than run selling
[5:14:52] Knaxxis: because u have to play ur char right
[5:15:01] Sickology514: HUH
[5:15:02] AnnxxR: @Knaxxis pretty sure u can still google some articles about the issue of gold buying in 2005
[5:15:04] Knaxxis: in sells u just jump off the edge
[5:15:20] wisptroll: i remember giving gold for gametime in mop lol
[5:15:22] Somanie: O I thought they were better because gdkp pools the profits from the night and distributes it
[5:15:27] Pingabreath: Hola brother
[5:15:33] Somanie: Little more economical ppc
[5:15:38] Knaxxis: thats true too in gdkp's at least u do earn something for ur time
[5:15:43] Knaxxis: only good caveat i think

Mutiplied by 100 months thats 1650 kroner. Lets say a pizza from pizzaria Miami is 100 kroner. That means @madd1n has financed 16 of Ziqos pizzas from Pizzeria Miami over the years. Plus a 50 kroner tip. ppc
