[8:08:26] RaymusRtic: He can do DW arms
[8:08:47] chocolatemilkbandit: duel wield
[8:08:51] CostcoMember: our fury warrior made an arguement that his dps doubling is more beneficial than 4% increase when we have a caster heavy raid
[8:08:52] iamgabe69: dual wield kebabs
[8:08:56] CostcoMember: which makes sense
[8:09:01] RaymusRtic: Duel wield Sword spec arms is fun
[8:09:09] RaymusRtic: it has the same rotation as fury
[8:09:31] iamgabe69: appeal of dw arms is rage gen for non stop cleaves on trash
[8:09:49] RaymusRtic: @iamgabe69 I am having fun with it on PTR
[8:09:54] chocolatemilkbandit: if ur not pushog speeds then who cares

[8:12:00] dad_blaster: arms in wrath was fun, rend ticks letting you overpower was sick
[8:12:05] RaymusRtic: Arms with Arm pen was good
[8:12:14] CostcoMember: I enjoy raiding as shadow priest more than mage because there is more for me to do
[8:12:16] RaymusRtic: But fury with titans grip was nuts
[8:12:19] Joqe: @jakenbakeLIVE just unlucky on drops? you seen one?
