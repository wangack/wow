[4:03:20] shinjuyoung: i been wanting to ask i see many top dh using LR + cheat trinket then DH discord argue that the  standard frailty buildis way way better, if that is so why those top DH doesnt use frailty?
[4:03:25] irius__: @alirxxa I mean - yeah, you can play both. However there's no need to have 100% uptime on spikes and if you're already having a cheat death, value of the 2nd one is much lower
[4:03:27] Mellbaa: also demon spikes is kinda rng, y u get alot armor but its still parry chance
[4:03:39] Vitaminw1: @shinjuyoung naowh is frailty right now
[4:03:57] alirxxa: @irius__ i respect that yea
[4:03:58] LastRowPat: hello im very noob is naowh soaking the tornados?
[4:04:15] shinjuyoung: ok but sometimes they went the LR right side tree, i like to know why

[4:04:42] irius__: Also, there are some places in which you can just build around 8-10 stacks of frailty instead of using a defensive and live with that
[4:04:48] irius__: But it's mostly tyra thing
[4:05:02] alirxxa: yes
[4:05:47] shinjuyoung: which build is tankier on fort tho? frailty or the LR?
[4:06:48] irius__: Depends on the dungeon and what are the bottlenecks
[4:06:58] irius__: The point is not to be "the tankiest" but not to die
[4:07:28] shinjuyoung: well isnt that the point? have the most tankiest spec = dont die
[4:07:53] irius__: Soulcrash is better against single big hits
[4:07:55] Maddjakni: well you don't necessarily need to be the tankiest in order to not die shinjuyoung
[4:07:57] mwahiloveyou: if u can simply do more damage chances are u wouldnt die before the other thing
[4:07:59] LightdarkGaming: died to a cuite flowers
[4:08:07] irius__: If you prevent more damage with feed the demon
[4:08:18] irius__: But then still die to a single hit due to lack of cd/soulcrash
[4:08:29] alirxxa: @irius__ u see?
[4:08:34] irius__: Then it wasn't worth it to prevent more damage thats not actually killing you
[4:08:40] aiiir_strikes: That BAM
[4:08:43] alirxxa: @irius__ melee is hurt alot
[4:08:47] shinjuyoung: TBH i feel safer with soulcrush build even on fort

[4:09:10] Fendrixs: get another dh for 2 darkness EZ
[4:09:10] Denekyy: seems like any tank will get shredded
[4:09:14] irius__: Issue here was that people died early in the pull and then as tank you just run out of juice, it would be difficult regardless of what talents he would be using :P

[4:13:28] L0mashu: @irius__ ty

[4:14:15] xCzeron: @L0mashu Yeah, I guess Velo could TLust him too
[4:14:28] Vitaminw1: @shinjuyoung soulmonger is bait, just copy builds off of subcreation or raider.io
[4:14:48] shinjuyoung: raider io top few are all using feed demon and LR
