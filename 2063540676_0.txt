I myself and a lot of others are hoping for an unchanged no microtransactions or wow token BC and maybe wrath server too. weâ€™re all dying to play BC from fresh though. we all feel like we didnâ€™t soak it in enough.
[3:26:02] dr0daN: @MacEleven shift-F. above his bags
[3:26:11] keysersoze_taken: this spec is qs and blood surge
[3:26:11] MacEleven: @dr0daN yeah its bound but not using

[3:26:32] keysersoze_taken: when it procs
[3:26:32] MacEleven: not that i've seen
[3:26:33] dr0daN: @MacEleven literally just saw him use it on the previous pack

[3:27:36] keysersoze_taken: so no ms
[3:28:08] keysersoze_taken: so u take both 5+ crits
[3:28:35] Hoffernz: he is using bloodsurge
[3:29:00] MacEleven: yeah i see it
[3:29:06] MacEleven: low proc chance
[3:29:21] DavidFosterFlawless: its 30% or something, it just only procs on WW BT and HS
[3:29:29] DavidFosterFlawless: and you dont use HS that much w/ 2h
[3:29:38] MacEleven: looks like he has QS tho
[3:30:29] Cactus456: omE

[3:33:44] kannert: For trash *
[3:34:20] DavidFosterFlawless: hard to get hit cap as fury so prob better

[3:38:02] boaslol: !prebis
[3:38:18] det_drar_4: !spec
[3:38:30] DavidFosterFlawless: spec is 26/5/0
[3:38:35] DavidFosterFlawless: dont know the specifics
[3:39:01] MacEleven: QS > WW > OP > slam on proc?
[3:39:07] DavidFosterFlawless: qs, blood surge, consumed by rage, flagellation
[3:40:02] itma1991: spec is a hybrid?
[3:40:19] DavidFosterFlawless: not really, you use QS to proc slam instead of MS
[3:40:26] DavidFosterFlawless: and go for the extra crit
[3:40:47] MacEleven: I dont think its CBR
[3:40:59] itma1991: frenzied assault prob
[3:40:59] DavidFosterFlawless: Ive seen it proc on him
[3:41:10] DavidFosterFlawless: during this raid
[3:41:11] MacEleven: where, he has 80 rage no enrage now
[3:41:55] vigleikx: frenzied assault then
[3:43:33] sweetvanill: Do you reckon Ravager is ever the go to weapon on trashpacks?
[3:43:42] MacEleven: hes prob running the spec so they can look at his logs and determine what the best spec is. atm no one knows
[3:44:12] keysersoze_taken: ye good part of having 3 warrs is u can test all the specs xd
[3:44:54] DavidFosterFlawless: nah ravager is bad, no WF procs cant instant attack, maybe against humongous pulls
[3:45:48] Haystackz: What spec you prefer then MN DW or 2h for gnomer?

[3:50:52] k0ckroach: Flagellation?

[3:52:32] bodkinz_: boonobo
[3:53:03] MacEleven: @DavidFosterFlawless It's shamanistic rage
[3:53:18] MacEleven: CBR appears as the "enrage" buff
[3:53:40] DavidFosterFlawless: makes sense
[3:53:47] Titanbladez: I think mojo mangeded to get lvl 30 by now
[3:53:49] KnibbeDee: 77 dmg overheat ye
[3:53:53] Titanbladez: managed*
[3:53:54] Philipios: is WW axe better than STV mace?
[3:54:05] Philipios: for 5% crit?
[3:54:17] Prawlx: yes
[3:54:21] Guihufas: anyone else hate playing with cbr?
[3:54:32] Prawlx: I dont play with it
[3:54:38] MacEleven: Doesnt 2h mace sim better for humans tho
[3:54:54] MacEleven: other than that its dog
[3:55:07] AndersbergDK: How is the ww axe better? because you are an orc?
[3:55:15] MacEleven: There is some like top 20 parses with mace but its because its week 1
[3:55:44] MacEleven: @AndersbergDK if you use a mace you are speccing 5 points into weird talents
[3:56:07] Hooooly_Moly: Sry tuned in late. So ww axe > stv mace?
[3:56:08] MacEleven: u prob skip MS and 5/5 wep and use 5/5 cruelty, that leaves u a bunch of points
[3:56:09] iNSANEono: 9head LULW
[3:56:19] Stopmirin: is bonebiter axe better then whirlwind axe?
[3:56:22] Stopmirin: for alliance
[3:56:27] Stockiss: 3Head
[3:56:42] FliegerVII: ye it is
[3:56:46] SternenWolfs: @Stopmirin yes
[3:56:47] marv_09: Moin assenia , kurze Frage . ist es mÃ¶glich die Tanks vom 18:30 raids von grp1-2 tauschen ? WÃ¼rde vom Setup nichts Ã¤ndern.
[3:56:48] AlmondButterd: bonebiter a little better
[3:57:18] AndersbergDK: @MacEleven Surely you just take 5 points into Cruelty, and drop MS and axe spec for 3/3 imp hs and overpower?
[3:57:29] MacEleven: @AndersbergDK im not sure
[3:57:39] AndersbergDK: If you use quickstrike anyway
[3:57:42] MacEleven: for sure you skip MS and go 5/5 cruelty
[3:57:47] AndersbergDK: you don't want ms
[3:58:07] MacEleven: some people using MS now tho
[3:58:10] MacEleven: with axes
[3:58:21] AndersbergDK: And then just take 3/3 Heroic strike and imp overpower
[3:58:23] MacEleven: slam > ms > ww
[3:58:44] AndersbergDK: Yea but that's because people thought quick strike was shit right?
[3:58:47] MacEleven: 3/3 hs makes sense cause ur prob using QS
[3:59:51] Philipios: you dont use MS?
[3:59:54] FliegerVII: with pvp mace u can even go 21/10/0
[4:00:04] AndersbergDK: And when you get the epic axe. You just drop imp overpower and take ether 5/5 in axe spec or cruelty, and 3/5 in the other
[4:00:13] dbc_insec: is he DW tankin
[4:00:57] MacEleven: @AndersbergDK would u take 2/2 cahrge 2/2 op or 2/2 op and 1/2 charge
[4:01:01] MacEleven: that leaves 1 point
[4:01:15] MacEleven: er 0/2 charge
[4:01:38] kelvinirl: axe comingggggggggg
[4:01:51] iNSANEono: server unlocked apparently?
[4:02:03] AndersbergDK: 0/2 in both charge and overpower if you get the epic axe
