When using the talent Gift of the Golden Val’kyr with Guardian of the Forgotten Queen (GoFQ), the paladin will get the benefits of GoFQ on themselves when brought below 30% health. This is a full 8 seconds of divine shield for the paladin, repeatable every 45 seconds. There is also no forbearance as a result of this.
