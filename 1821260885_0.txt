[0:42:11] Dazdru: Yep
[0:42:18] wEiRdO_dUdE: Oh yeah, going silent was the play of the race
[0:42:20] Alepouditsa: for me the didn't win so who cares danKEK
[0:42:20] PadidinJones: @Towelliee technically Echo got the fastest kill or no?
[0:42:49] Alepouditsa: @wEiRdO_dUdE meh more like despert

[0:43:20] falldrgn: But we also can't say they didn't have people watching Echo or methods stream either
[0:43:27] Molvonos: @cokezero1337 They won.  That's all that matters.  Calling them chicken or whatever the fuck mental gymnastics doesnt pay bills or keep sponsorships.

[0:43:59] Molvonos: They didnt win.
[0:44:02] Kaype92: Doesn’t matter if Echo or Liquid or whoever spent the least amount of time or killed whatever boss fastest. Liquid killed it first. They win. End of story, and I’m an Echo supporter lol
[0:44:04] Molvonos: Again, mental gymnastics.
[0:44:07] Alepouditsa: @cokezero1337 yep
[0:44:12] wEiRdO_dUdE: I think the coms is a big reason why Max's channel is more popular than the Liquid channel
[0:44:14] Assekk: xDDD
[0:44:23] PadidinJones: @jmalmin Right but seems kinda weird or unfair IMO. I prefer Limit anyways. Echo is Method. Me no likey method
[0:44:26] jmalmin: Thats the problem when stuff does not release at the same time for EU and US.
[0:44:27] tvshowstopper: Nah echo lost time on a kill doesn’t matter who killed it first does
[0:44:47] tripl3heart: the only way liquid can win is offstream lol but sure they won yay
[0:44:59] tvshowstopper: Hey if eu doesn’t like the release time they can switch to na
[0:45:18] falldrgn: and most guilds will kill it faster after reset..

[0:45:24] tvshowstopper: @tripl3heart you have got to be kidding
[0:45:33] Armdel: everyone (including echo themselves) will say liquid won. only a few insane fans will say something along the lines of "akshully echo started 10 hours later"
[0:45:38] PadidinJones: @tvshowstopper Word

[0:45:58] wEiRdO_dUdE: Having a global launch time could still screw EU out of much of a day
[0:46:09] Rottencoarse: @Molvonos you're probably right Molv
[0:46:16] Rottencoarse: also morning chat :)
[0:46:19] tvshowstopper: Tired of cry babies echo lost every time they lose or eh loses they cry like little babies
[0:46:20] Alepouditsa: @wEiRdO_dUdE not if done right
[0:46:22] PadidinJones: @Armdel I think Limit started the race later anyways no?
[0:46:42] jmalmin: It does not matter. Liquid killed the boss first. Echo can enjoy spending the least time to get the kill. :D They will still be 2nd this time.
[0:46:46] wEiRdO_dUdE: If content goes live at like noon in California, that's like 11 at night for EU players?
[0:46:54] Clicklesly: The only way timing would really be the issue is if it would happen today after Liquid already got their reset
[0:46:57] tvshowstopper: Echo did more splits than liquid that’s their fault period
[0:46:59] Molvonos: I don't even have any skin in the game, but to say that Echo won due to a technicality is some disingenuous bullshit and they'd be pissed at their supposed fans trying to gaslight that shgit
[0:47:13] Alepouditsa: @jmalmin that why the say the won
[0:47:15] tripl3heart: lol first raid they win in a lot of tiers and again: offstream andy strikes again topKEKW
[0:47:39] wEiRdO_dUdE: You think Blizzard is going to launch things at 3 AM California time to give EU and advantage in a global launch scenario? No way
[0:47:39] cinnamints: @PadidinJones Yeah, with NA maint being much longer it's like 6-8 hours at the most for several years now.
[0:47:49] tvshowstopper: @tripl3heart ur annoying shut up
[0:48:21] carmelchaos: towHAMUP towHAMUP towHAMUP
[0:49:00] idenkaz_: Liquid was on fire this tier. its not science why they won the race. was amazing to see how close it was tho. method also did good
[0:49:03] falldrgn: Echo always does more splits.. did it hurt them this time? I don't think so, it was the hours of avoidable deaths in P1 of the fight.
[0:49:06] PadidinJones: @cinnamints Basically what Im saying. Just wondering the timeline of the kill. Again! UBER Limit fan really stoked they won
[0:49:16] jmalmin: Next raid I hope it lasts longer then a 4-5 days :)
[0:49:35] PotbellyGoat: towComfy towHAMUP
[0:49:51] PadidinJones: Can I just say that the boss just melted so quickly? I feel like it was under tuned a bit
[0:50:17] dyslexican1: Morning chat, I see the Echo trolls are, or at lest one of them are at it already..
[0:50:19] Rottencoarse: morning @Towelliee  :)
[0:50:29] Effin_Steffin: 6 days was fine. aint nobody got time for that shit lol
[0:50:39] falldrgn: 5-10 days is ideal for a race. if we get into a Sepulcher type situation..that was no fun
[0:50:47] wEiRdO_dUdE: For the best players in the world, everything is undertuned unless Blizzard makes it stupid hard
[0:50:57] xendros78: 40 people in the world have killed sark, pretty sure that doesn't equate to undertuned

[0:51:00] Rottencoarse: yeah sepulcher was no fun :D
[0:51:03] jmalmin: Either way its a good raid :) I have enjoyed it so far.
[0:51:13] PadidinJones: Right I remember what you said yesterday that the raid seemed to be tuned for everyone. Thats how I felt as well @Towelliee
[0:51:30] azell117: @dyslexican1 the last time the raid was tuned for world first guilds the raid was waaay overtuned

[0:51:59] jmalmin: This raid had no Crab boss :)

[0:52:01] wEiRdO_dUdE: I think it is a good raid and most of it was easy for these awesome teams, but it's still tuned just about right for the game overall
[0:52:01] PadidinJones: I think the raid "Hall of Fame" will fill up pretty quick this time
[0:52:08] dj__lando: i think they did a great job, shorter encounters but tougher mechanics
[0:52:09] Rottencoarse: @Towelliee  have u seen meeres's tweet yesterday after kill?
[0:52:16] desti_gaming: The more RWF will continues, the more will feel the raid is "undertuned" because the more these guys compete against each other the more they will improve and being able to do a race in less than a week
[0:52:32] akia03: they make the raid easy so more people raid longer
[0:52:47] PadidinJones: @Towelliee you start running Mythic already?
[0:52:51] DunzoCD: I actually really  like this raid tier i dont need it to be crazy difficult to be fun
[0:52:56] wEiRdO_dUdE: Oh yeah, a lot of people want to run this raid
[0:53:13] Yogibearboog: If the bosses are going too be tuned like this moving forward I'd put my money on liquid to win more than echo now.
[0:53:15] Rottencoarse: https://twitter.com/MeeresTV/status/1658258741173661697 @Towelliee
[0:53:18] Twyzted_f8: Not really undertuned besides mag, lackluster on the other hand perhaps
[0:53:23] Kiddeath77: everyting
[0:53:26] b1z49: meers might call it a day as well
[0:53:39] wraaith: 16 hours and ez content will always make it unfair the harder content pushes it into mid 2nd week and thats whenthe advantage goes away
[0:53:43] falldrgn: Scripes rant was right.. just a little salty
[0:53:44] Rottencoarse: i think scripe was tilted last night @Towelliee  during the attempts for Sarkj
[0:54:03] Moobot: Calm the spam, @keeto7 (warning)
[0:54:13] akia03: nah echo and method will just go together again
[0:54:25] Rottencoarse: @Towelliee  also meeres is thinking of leaving RWF
[0:54:25] dyslexican1: @azell117 I didn't say anything about tuning. I said something about Echo trolls making excuses... ?
[0:54:28] Moobot: Ask a moderator for permission before posting a link, @keeto7 (warning)
[0:54:40] PadidinJones: Nice mog lol
[0:54:40] wEiRdO_dUdE: I think for all highly competitive people, coming in second stings... I  don't blame anyone for being salty
[0:55:03] azell117: @dyslexican1 sorry that was meant for someone else, chat scroll had me reply to the wrong chatter
[0:55:32] falldrgn: 9 bosses.. liquid will win if its a 10-11 boss raid.. that favors echo
[0:55:34] Alepouditsa: @cokezero1337 nuh the just didn't take a brake
[0:55:40] cinnamints: Max mentioned their General Manager with Liquid's org told them they had full support to go offline if it was the right strategic call
[0:55:43] wEiRdO_dUdE: It was still a pretty close race

[0:55:44] keeto7: the main raid progress tracker site (can't link, lol) posted a link to the specific timestamp for the scripe chat. search for "echo had some comments".
[0:55:51] DunzoCD: That won them the race for sure
[0:55:53] Chibrotle: Max said the General Manager for Liquid suggested it.
[0:55:54] wraaith: as i responded on ur tweet we lost out the most on that call
[0:55:55] love_eggplant: nice fade haircut
[0:55:57] idenkaz_: as far as i know they had full support
[0:56:04] Kitsunema: the race is settled?
[0:56:15] Kaype92: People were speculating that if Liquid didn’t get WF that they would lose sponsors
[0:56:18] idenkaz_: was just a mega call that paid off
[0:56:24] Kaype92: Idk if that’s true
[0:56:25] Effin_Steffin: Max shutting off the stream was a 5Head play
[0:56:26] Trobbels: Throwback to Denathrius where Echo did it and oh boy... KEKW
[0:56:26] heydjzs: one of the main liquid people said they could shut it off i think
[0:56:42] Molvonos: @cokezero1337 Nah, they didn't.  Don't be spreading misinformation.

[0:59:54] dracullus: Max was just more hungry for win after last few races
[1:00:10] Rottencoarse: @Towelliee  yeah echo was dying ALOT at phase 2
[1:00:32] volkreig: Max seemed so happy i feel so good for him
[1:00:37] Kaype92: Last tier Echo had Naowh and Justwait tanking, its not easy to lose 2 of their best tanks
[1:00:53] Rottencoarse: even scripe got tilted about it since  Velo(the mistweaver) was dying alot there

[1:01:46] Molvonos: @Towelliee Check Disc when you can please
[1:01:48] idenkaz_: also healthy competition is it not? i think it was good that liquid won
[1:01:50] handlebarswow: Script
[1:02:01] Kaype92: @rottencoarse I thought justwait tanked for a good bit?
[1:02:17] wraaith: wasnt it rodger be4 scripe ?
[1:02:21] Kaype92: Roger is co-leader
[1:02:23] b1z49: IF THEY LOSE MEERS ANd scripe. echo are done
[1:02:27] rica3d0: 8 adds in a row? :/ ffs
[1:02:28] Rottencoarse: roger is at good strategy also @Towelliee
[1:02:30] handlebarswow: Scripe was being a poor loser imo
[1:02:33] b1z49: sorry for caps
[1:02:34] akia03: wouldnt echo just go to method than
[1:02:47] idenkaz_: caould you imagine a 4 teams head to head race. omg
[1:02:53] Kaype92: Scripe is just fed up I think
[1:02:59] wEiRdO_dUdE: I would imagine we just have to wait a few weeks and see where people are at
[1:03:06] Tharia: wait, so they're going to decide who won based on start time? wth
[1:03:11] xendros78: echo nuthuggers would lose their shit if there was a re-merge with method LUL
[1:03:13] ArcaneSyntax: Perhaps echo should just get good.
[1:03:18] Twyzted_f8: That’s the reality
[1:03:27] munasauna: I was so disappointed with how he behaved after the loss. Even mocked Max. Very sore loser.
[1:03:36] Tharia: oh ok lol
[1:03:37] Rottencoarse: also scripe just had a kid so
[1:03:48] nouwandhi: Liquid was just better
[1:04:00] handlebarswow: Huge? Idk about that
[1:04:04] Kaype92: I mean scripe has a valid excuse however the launch date for these raids haven’t been a factor the last 2-3 times Echo won
[1:04:15] b1z49: i wanted TL to win they got fucked over at Xmas
[1:04:16] glupertv: @Rottencoarse we all are kids. we playing a game made for kids

[1:06:10] Lostdogal: I was surprised at how much the guilds genuinely dont like each other. shits hilarious.
[1:06:10] wEiRdO_dUdE: Global release, regardless of time, can work because we are a bunch of degens that will get up early or stay up late
[1:06:14] ScruffyPez: @Gingerprimer thanks
[1:06:18] ArcaneSyntax: @vrtnipatuljak way less players, NA is worse at eSports in general
[1:06:18] Phantomstrk: if the vast majority cared enough about global release it would be changed, no way wow could ignore it, but it's not the vast majority, which is why they don't
[1:06:19] Chibrotle: I think the advantage that NA has starting early is balanced out by the advantage EU gets seeing strats/comps that are effective.
[1:06:19] kevnil: but why do ppl ALWAYS say shiet that doesnt make any sense or just shit talk after every race and it doesnt matter who wins? xD
[1:06:25] falldrgn: @VrtniPatuljak What? Echo speeks english.. its probably not their first language. but still what?
[1:06:52] Twyzted_f8: Yeah what would happen if Asia got an equal release
[1:07:08] Gingerprimer: And how efficent guilds are with splits aswell
[1:07:11] ArcaneSyntax: After the 4 hour maintenance it's like 6~ hours
[1:07:26] Kaype92: The only way it will ever be fair IS global release. Though even then people would still complain that it’s released at an inconvenient time lol
[1:07:39] ZakuzaGB: ZakuzaGB subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 68 months! 
[1:07:43] The_K0pp: In a short race like this one i believe the NA has a slight advantage. Longer races it wont matter
[1:07:50] VrtniPatuljak: @VrtniPatuljak as EU I hate playing CS because everyone reverts to cursing in native.

[1:07:53] leeysttv: Global release would be good. But people would still find excuses
[1:08:07] wEiRdO_dUdE: Sounds right to me
[1:08:09] pragmacktic: Yeah sepulcher was a lot
[1:08:14] falldrgn: Didn't they adjust maitnenance for EU back a few hours recently?
[1:08:21] Moobot: No need to repeat yourself, @kevnil (warning)
[1:08:40] Twyzted_f8: I don’t know why it’s not a thing yet.  After this many years
[1:08:44] ArcaneSyntax: I don't think they do a global release to cater to the top 5 guilds over literally everyone else.
[1:08:53] dyslexican1: Honestly, as a viewer, I start tuning out after the first week or so. I get fatigued and stop caring.
[1:09:09] SR_Willjar: from their PoV it's probably because if no one is playing their game due to maintenance it looks bad for stakeholders. which is BS
[1:09:18] Rturnerz: So much RNG involved in race it can never truly be fair
[1:09:21] Yogibearboog: When people say they shouldn't global release for 60 players its so dumb, I'm a random pleb and I'd rather get the raid same day as NA.
[1:09:23] qrazieee: GG Liquid! Cheers from EU <3

[1:09:30] ArcaneSyntax: Both guilds had full tier, all the trinkets they wanted.
[1:09:31] Lostdogal: yeah an easier raid will make the staggered release a bigger problem. but it's really the guilds event. I think blizzard are better off not changing anything to suit them.

[1:10:29] volkreig: They got to a 4% gap that isn’t bad
[1:10:29] Kaype92: Echo for sure wasn’t 100% this tier
[1:10:31] bigholmes1999: Method still going at it
[1:10:33] Twyzted_f8: Yeah they underperformed.  They did not perform like they did on jailer
[1:10:36] Mozzeyy_: What kind of race has 2 starting times though LUL
[1:10:38] TheCliffyShow: How many pulls was the Liquid kill?
[1:10:39] volkreig: But liquid just played way better
[1:10:41] nouwandhi: And why do you think there were like that?
[1:10:41] idenkaz_: that poor dude man
[1:10:51] Jaqhuir: tobo got rigged with his trinket
[1:10:57] pragmacktic: Tryna get a trinket xD
[1:11:20] bebincalicious: EU/NA aside, just find it weird that it's called a race with two different start times. Maybe global release eventually
[1:11:25] Kaype92: Tobo caster cursed his own guild at 1.4% lol
[1:11:28] falldrgn: Tobo was this RWF Narcoleese.. go only to get benched.
[1:11:29] Molvonos: You could really see how clean Liquid did their runs yesterday by where they kept dropping their void puddles.  Shit was almost mechanical.
[1:11:29] idenkaz_: that 14,4% was a moment for sure
[1:11:39] Molvonos: While Echo's void puddles were everywhere.
[1:11:39] huggetsomstucket: Since liquid did off stream the race will probably not be the same next tier. Maybe this was the last broadcasted race we will see?
[1:12:03] idenkaz_: nah too lucrative
[1:12:03] StreamElements: Use code FACTORSE36440 for 50% off your first box at https://strms.net/factor75_towelliee
[1:12:04] Phantomstrk: At the point echo got that low, they didn't' have "time" which is why they went against what they normally do and started shotgun pulling
[1:12:33] Rturnerz: Liquid seemed to have much better healing raid always seemed topped up but echo seems to be always low
[1:12:34] EmmaRamos: i can downgrade mine
[1:12:35] falldrgn: I am praying thats not a strat moving forward.
[1:12:41] Goddlin: @Towelliee 12 brack?
[1:12:41] TheCliffyShow: I have a Uldaman 13.
[1:12:43] Cello_73: @huggetsomstucket what key you need?
[1:12:50] The_K0pp: I would have a key but sadly im EU
[1:12:51] Towelliee: !bent
[1:12:54] pragmacktic: I think at that point @phantomstrk they just needed everyone to stay alive

[1:13:20] falldrgn: For the vault, can you get loot from any boss in the raid? or only bosses you killed that week?
[1:13:21] Phantomstrk: @pragmacktic agree
[1:13:21] Molvonos: NA
[1:13:31] zolomon_lane: roger deaths lol
[1:13:34] Phantomstrk: Tanks were getting smacked around like clothies lol

[1:13:53] pragmacktic: There was just sooooo much dmg at <23%
[1:13:56] KingSpud91: @akia03 no
[1:13:58] wEiRdO_dUdE: There is some kind of crazy debuff that goes onto the tanks in that fight
[1:14:01] MRRowdyRuff: you want a fat 19 brackenhide
[1:14:03] fizzle_wizard: Just think Echo weren't on their A-Game the whole race. Lots of sloppy pulls and near misses. Liquid deserved it big time.
[1:14:09] idenkaz_: DKs with the 200k heals. like wtf
[1:14:15] mavericks312: the race never really felt close imo
[1:14:17] Rottencoarse: yeah rycen should have been healing instead of the other priest @Towelliee
[1:14:23] Rottencoarse: he was calling healing shots instead
[1:14:34] TheCliffyShow: I sent the bnet request.
[1:14:37] Molvonos: The fact BDGG might come in third is magical.
[1:14:37] sycnessx: just under 6, but yes
[1:14:41] Molvonos: If Method doesn't
[1:14:51] Lexxania: Even max said they should have killed it earlier
[1:14:54] Armdel: ye it got pretty close because liquid took their time
[1:14:58] wEiRdO_dUdE: Echo was basically just a few hours behind on the last day, I think
[1:15:01] mavericks312: they had a 5% pull then regressed hard
[1:15:03] ZakuzaGB: im glad liquid won a tier cos it keeps the future interesting haha
[1:15:13] MRRowdyRuff: @Towelliee you want a thick 19 brackenhide key?
[1:15:26] Gingerprimer: Nah he talked about it post win on stream

[1:15:31] Armdel: Max said it should have died 5 hours earlier than it did iirc
[1:15:37] Twyzted_f8: I wonder if the tank deaths were a combo of tank mistakes and healer deaths leading to that
[1:15:39] pragmacktic: Echo felt the same though. They got to 1.9% and struggled the next 10 pulls
[1:15:46] Twyzted_f8: It was sloppy
[1:15:51] ZakuzaGB: i saw the naysayers coming out of the woodwork on twitter saying that echo has less pulls etc haha  why cant people just be happy for others :P
[1:15:52] Moobot:  The website has gotten a...hellish..makeoever https://www.towelliee.com/ to keep updated on everything that's going on with the WoW:DF Marathons. Backgrounds, goals and giveaways, talents and UI we have it all!
[1:15:56] mavericks312: now meeres doesnt kno if he will be back next tier
[1:15:58] dyslexican1: Real talk though, it was nice to see a third guild on the last boss when Liquid and Echo were. Not a MEthod fan, but it was god to see someone else in the conversation at least.
[1:15:59] Phantomstrk: you could tell he wasn't, he was getting frustrated and stressed as i think they expected to come on, and within 2 hours have it down.  But max even said that if they slept a few more hours they would of gotten it in 30 mins, but i don't think so because them coming on early threw Echo off their game
[1:16:04] Kaype92: This Method team is getting scary though. I thought a full rebuild would take awhile but they are getting really good really fast
[1:16:16] pragmacktic: I'm just happy th3y both got it before the reset

[1:16:33] Phantomstrk: @Kaype92 Yeah, Method showed up, made it a 3 way race because they were kind of the wildcard
[1:17:16] Phantomstrk: the phrase "shambles" is used alot haha
[1:17:18] KingSpud91: literally any guild would do that though
[1:17:25] wEiRdO_dUdE: I kept hearing how Echo always took time between pulls, true
[1:17:34] KingSpud91: oh for sure
[1:17:38] idenkaz_: the moment they logs got public you could sense the change on the couch and the whole raid team.
[1:17:40] twilightsparklepwny: its not a race when the contestants dont start the same time
[1:17:49] Lostdogal: I feel like they pulled a shit tonne last race to be honest, but I agree, they panicked
[1:17:51] mavericks312: i neveer seen echo that shook
[1:18:07] KingSpud91: So its time for teams to go back to not streaming RWF? :P
[1:18:14] SphinxyOCE: LUL
[1:18:27] Breadpie: As soon as Liquid's percent updated at 6am PST, you could visibly see them shook.
[1:18:33] Phantomstrk: so next race, what you'll see is more off stream pulls and strats i'd say on the last 2 bosses
[1:18:45] KingSpud91: @Phantomstrk 100%
[1:18:48] Talason: how many +20s did rump pump out
[1:18:55] zolomon_lane: portal positions are weird
[1:18:55] Phantomstrk: then walk in and do the kill pulls on stream
[1:19:03] Kaype92: I for one blame the Echo loss due to lack of ELX aka gingi juice
[1:19:15] Zucchey: RWF needs a solution for split times, disconnected me fully this time around
[1:19:18] volkreig: Liquid taking the risk on barely any sleep to kill boss was play of the tier
[1:19:21] Zarvren88: Echo were "Not Prepared" !
[1:19:32] falldrgn: if they killed it off stream, that would be kinda shitty
[1:19:32] Moobot: Tune in Jun 1st for our Second ever SUBATHON! It will be uncapped with tons of prizes and lots of goals! 4080/4090 RTX, CORSAIR, RAZER, GAMER ADVANTAGE and MORE!

[1:19:36] flebbooo: people always finding excuses to mald
[1:19:41] pragmacktic: Echo just stopped attending gingers gamer gym
[1:19:48] Talason: did your paladin get a 20 T
[1:19:50] pragmacktic: Gingi's*
[1:19:57] twilightsparklepwny: i would watch a proper race with same start tho
[1:19:58] zolomon_lane: tobo world first trinket
[1:19:58] qrazieee: Liquid did just play better! Both guilds are insanely good! :)
[1:19:58] akia03: echo might need to remove some of there older players and get new blood in
[1:20:05] KingSpud91: @akia03 lol what
[1:20:08] Cello_73: Mex said the GM gave him the OK to go offstream and he immediately made the call
[1:20:18] Phantomstrk: @akia03 no point if they leave the new blood on the caster couch

[1:20:28] levraijeanguy: LUL
[1:20:52] kevnil: liquid was so much better then echo this tier  but they should have had the kill almost right away but they wiped how many hours? 4-5?
[1:20:59] Chibrotle: GM suggested it, Max took him up on it.
[1:21:02] danimoto10: dude, some of echo players kinda disappointed with the gz massage to liquid, this we killed it faster is kinda bs
[1:21:03] Zucchey: We did VP 20 in 3h last night :D Felt like mythic progress with cd planning and all of that, last boss here is a pain, if you get an overlap and don't have defensive, you're a goner

[1:21:29] kevnil: and if liquid would have wiped even more hrs who knows what would have happend
[1:21:46] idenkaz_: imo the race needs a bit of salt but they're cool with each other
[1:22:04] falldrgn: The memes are "tongue and cheek"
[1:22:14] volkreig: Did you not see the gingi tweet before rwf? @towelliee
[1:22:16] danimoto10: lol I guess so
[1:22:18] Twyzted_f8: None of them are mad at each other
[1:22:24] Lostdogal: Max said on stream yesterday that the guilds genuinely dont get along
[1:22:37] Sttarrkz: gz on na world first!
[1:22:39] flebbooo: oh no now i'm reading a bunch of wfirst takes that the raid was too easy and they need to fix the tuning...
[1:22:46] Phantomstrk: gingi's stream was salty at the end, talked about how Liquid "used what was given to them" haha
[1:22:47] Twyzted_f8: Both know they are at the mercy of how blizzard approaches things
[1:22:57] maintanktony: E3@armdel
[1:23:03] Kaype92: Gingi trolls a ton lol he had like a 3 hour conversation with Max during the MDI where they just chilled and talked about random stuff

[1:30:41] OpiumHC: US, how dare you?
[1:30:43] fistofnature: wow is more popular in eu so its natural it has more fans
[1:30:47] DarkRattz: its all ogre now!!
[1:30:50] Ironcladd: tbf thats how it should be
[1:30:51] akia03: if eu wins na does that when na wins eu does that
[1:30:51] nouwandhi: Dont play NA victim
[1:30:52] Zeke_nl: both guilds own, echo won the last 3 its nice to see liquid get this one after what they went through the last 3 tiers.
[1:30:56] Ironcladd: us aint supposed 2 win
[1:31:00] kevnil: so stupid xD
[1:31:03] Zucchey: Both sides are exactly the same, the trolls are more vocal when it happens
[1:31:06] Kaype92: @molvonos I know it needs its own new role lol
[1:31:22] Lostdogal: sure, I remember NA weren't salty at all last race. Was all quiet
[1:31:32] Nebulizer87: Probably the most hands off blizzard has been with the raid tuning and hot fixes  in awhile that was refreshing
[1:31:33] emznev: As if us ain't salty when eu wins either kekw
[1:31:34] GrimmKrimm: GrimmKrimm subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 43 months! 
[1:31:35] Zeke_nl: im happy echo lost, they win everything rwf wdi arena. all the excuses are super cringe
[1:31:36] akia03: and allot its just funny to piss people off with it
[1:31:43] Masqerader: races is over, give us our catalysty Blizzard
[1:31:45] kalithian2: i think people are just a little surprised is all because this is liquids first win since castle nathria so
[1:31:47] Molvonos: @Kaype92 It still does DPS though.  It's the DPS equivalent to a Disc priest, so it'll fit in a DPS role, like Disc does healer.
[1:31:55] Thoreya: i mean last tier was kinda bs so i get it lol
[1:32:20] desti_gaming: Imagine doing Olympic Games and let the 1st athlete 30 seconds in advance for a 3000m race. Is it fair ? No everybody starts at the same time. Nobody can complain about this fact. If NA wins, its not because they are better, its because they are good and get content first.  If you see the time spent on boss, NA are never first with that

[1:32:50] SpoofAvatar: @desti_gaming eu loser detected
[1:33:08] falldrgn: ill bet the liquid guys will get a nice  bonus for winning
[1:33:09] 91Niki: @desti_gaming Spotted the salty EU peep
[1:33:14] Thoreya: @desti_gaming cope

[1:33:44] Quojin: Agree @91Niki
[1:33:44] blunt_malunt: Echo performance was lackluster for sure
[1:33:52] SphinxyOCE: the healing especially was not there at all
[1:33:53] Ghrowler: what on earth are you talking about
[1:33:57] SpoofAvatar: Gingi looked discombobulated
[1:33:57] fistofnature: echo seemed very stressed out during the last boss
[1:33:58] emznev: Niki not all of us our salty you know ? BibleThump towIgnit
[1:34:01] kalithian2: it was really close echo had him down to 5% when liquid got the kill
[1:34:03] Cello_73: @desti_gaming imagine if that athlete started the final leg of the race before the other team...aka Echo had more time on the last boss and started progress before Liquid
[1:34:06] akia03: so why dont they use the time played in the raid besides the first kill?
[1:34:09] 91Niki: @emznev I know, I am from EU :p
[1:34:10] pragmacktic: I think they all did great 👍
[1:34:10] sotsil_: well maybe its lorgok and Fragnance gap??who knows
[1:34:11] Twyzted_f8: They started the day ok and post lunch they were a whole different team
[1:34:23] ziiakk_: was my first time watching a world first race had no idea what was going on but it was hype to see liquid win
[1:34:28] BTiZZY_: thinking about getting back into retail hows the patch? @towelliee

[1:34:31] Kaype92: Echo is like the Patriots of WoW, they can afford to lose some and not tarnish their good reputation
[1:34:42] SpoofAvatar: tobo spent too much time farming a trinket
[1:34:42] wEiRdO_dUdE: Tobo is great, but it's a team effort
[1:34:43] Zucchey: Tobo still farming the trinket in Neltharus
[1:34:45] Thoreya: maybe eu recruits start going to method now instead of echo
[1:34:59] ohnot___her: @desti_gaming imagine posting this bs and not looking at last boss pull count 😂
[1:35:16] Cello_73: definitely impressed with Method, quite the progress from the depths they were in
[1:35:39] wEiRdO_dUdE: Tobo got that trinket after like 21 runs!
[1:35:44] E3mittc: When is US reset?
[1:35:57] Cello_73: today
[1:35:59] SpoofAvatar: a few hours
[1:36:01] shadowman1414: Echo did win the last three so
[1:36:02] emznev: Ye people need to talk about method they ain't to far behind and played really good

[1:36:36] wEiRdO_dUdE: Method at 17.3% right now
[1:36:45] Thoreya: wonder if andybrew passed his trial
[1:36:48] 91Niki: Love how EU still memes about NA beta testers of reset and patch days KEKW but once it comes to rwf, and LOSING, then suddenly it isn't fair LUL

[1:58:34] wEiRdO_dUdE: Augmentation is a real game changer
[1:58:42] flebbooo: yh that was Pog
[1:58:43] Infebdo: yup, now it drops on all difficulties
[1:58:48] Myth_The_Wolf: People guessed it was, it popped up for a sec during day 1 of the patch
[1:58:49] NeoSeraphim: Just leveling a brewmaster, is there a site or twitch streamer that you would recommend? For rotation and how to play brewmaster?
[1:58:58] fistofnature: evoker POGGERS

[1:59:17] zaetemira: good suprise tbh :D
[1:59:17] ScurvyHyam: Yup - thats amazing
[1:59:22] Molvonos: A region needs to clear mythic for it to open in their area

[1:59:23] PvtHudson093: nah Blizz unlocked it as of todays reset
[1:59:23] wEiRdO_dUdE: @NeoSeraphim THe WoWhead spec guides are really good
[1:59:26] Zucchey: very low on lfr, higher with every difficulty
[1:59:29] Myth_The_Wolf: It'll drop from all difficulties, with the harder being likelier
[1:59:29] PYRO_MANI8C: sang will be the first to have it
[1:59:30] Milanesa_De_Pollo: Getting a legendary from LFR now EZ Clap
[1:59:32] Samurai3434: I'm levelling my Evoker now
[1:59:38] Molvonos: I already have all the mats ready to go
[1:59:39] flebbooo: thats a EU wow token KEKW
[1:59:42] LeeqWeed: What kind of healthbar are you using?
[1:59:42] Sttarrkz: a secret last boss should also be nice to have
[1:59:43] falldrgn: I think it would be cool to tie to something like that. Destiny has done that a few times with raid clears.
[1:59:45] TheCliffyShow: @mavericks312 Don't think it's going to be a 100% drop or anything.
[1:59:47] Kitsunema: oh so its like when the WF raid team for destiny 2 gets the raid exotic
[1:59:47] Rudric_Ice: nothing for u cuz u buy tokens
[1:59:55] marineboi1288: Would have been cool if there was like a secret cinematic for sarkareth
[1:59:56] herobreaker19: and you just know the Aug evoker will be mandatory in the next raid
[2:00:14] chinfu303: @Rudric_Ice i dont buy tokens and its not alot
[2:00:19] booty48: @towelliee why does EU hate NA?
[2:00:22] Thoreya: patch is a damn banger
[2:00:30] Infebdo: This expansion is special, it's very good
[2:00:31] Zolshy89: KEKW
[2:00:31] wEiRdO_dUdE: Exactly LUL
[2:00:31] medanmarko: @herobreaker19 For ALL next raids.
[2:00:34] flebbooo: 9/10 patch for me, a good direction for wow
[2:00:34] Thoreya: i wanna play 24/7 lol
[2:00:40] illStefan: +
[2:00:43] Myth_The_Wolf: I saw some Liquid, some Method complaining and praising the tuning
[2:00:48] Odinslayer: well tbh its not 6 days, it was 2.5 days of mythic progressing the other days were splits so yea it was undertuned
[2:00:51] Sicknessqt: My Favorite raid sicne nighthold LUL
[2:00:55] Effin_Steffin: That’s pretty dope to unlock a different spec
[2:01:02] joe_g_433: I don’t get why people say the raid was short. Sylv died on the 6th day as well?
[2:01:05] PYRO_MANI8C: i love this tier
[2:01:06] Nebulizer87: Yup I think this is better for the whole
[2:01:06] herdthestout: was it under tuned or tuned where past ones ended up after its nerfed
[2:01:07] Yogibearboog: I only just come back after a break and love the raid and love the gear upgrade system.
[2:01:09] Zeke_nl: the only people saying raid was under tuned was echo because the long 300+ pull bosses benefit them
[2:01:10] flebbooo: Honestly the most underrated thing about this patch is not having thundering around KEKW
[2:01:14] Nebulizer87: You have to stop catering to the degens
[2:01:15] Rudric_Ice: @Rudric_Ice sure i dont wanna spend 2hrs to work ingame when im already working
[2:01:19] Masqerader: I am just happy the last boss wasn't over 10 minutes
[2:01:27] PvtHudson093: didnt they hotfix the invisable motes in the down stairs phase?
[2:01:30] Hupu_a: this tier changes compared to sepulcher changes KEKW
[2:01:31] SpoofAvatar: @Odinslayer not for 99% of the wow population
[2:01:32] Incredible_Sausage: 9 out of 10 patch
[2:01:34] mavericks312: @odinslayer more players have killed a boss on mythic in this tier then any other tier
[2:01:39] Holysal: @odinslayer whocares. Its only a few guilds issue
[2:01:41] TweektheProphet: i feel toon for semi casuals (those that play ebough to raid)
[2:01:41] Myth_The_Wolf: Global release please
[2:01:42] wEiRdO_dUdE: EZdodge
[2:01:50] flebbooo: IonJam
[2:01:50] Yogibearboog: Exactly
[2:01:53] Odinslayer: @Holysal we talking about the RWF lol
[2:01:57] TheCliffyShow: I've done Neltharion and Sarkareth on normal, and those are crazy fights. But, in a good way.
[2:02:04] Myth_The_Wolf: That way EU can feel how broken the game feels on Tuesday, too
[2:02:08] Holysal: @mavericks312 that's a good thing for everyone
[2:02:08] Odinslayer: @Odinslayer well yea we talking about the RWF not the other 99%
[2:02:10] Alienfromger: yeah if rwf last so short headstart matters more
[2:02:24] mavericks312: @odinslayer it doesn’t just effect RwF though

[2:02:39] Akoudadis: hey jumped back to wow after 3 months and went into the raid (normal) with zero knowledge and i had great time. Not too hard mechanics and perfect for 400+ last season gear
[2:02:44] zeeAbe: Isn't reset in Taiwanese servers Thursday or somethin?
[2:02:45] xeavv: Didnt they say that they didnt want Global reset because if they have a problem with one region they dont want the servers to have to go down globally?
[2:02:46] Rudric_Ice: china always numba wan
[2:02:49] Zeke_nl: i loved when at blizzcon they used to get two guilds race live like method and Blood legion or Blood legion and midwinter @Towelliee
[2:02:50] Eviltuna13: I do like how the Lego only drops when mythic end boss dies on other difficulties
[2:02:53] TheCliffyShow: Also one of the few MMOs that doesn't have player housing.
[2:02:55] Milanesa_De_Pollo: isn't reset in the mdidle fo the night for Oceanic?
[2:02:55] fistofnature: what is the server reset is so far down the spagetti code that it removes something else from the game
[2:03:04] dyslexican1: Ian's " we don;t want to change the game for 5 people" is so BS. they do SO MANY THINGS that they do directly to affect those people. Its disingenuous.
[2:03:10] KaisenSiru: Completion Pog
[2:03:24] Rudric_Ice: player housing is overrated bro
[2:03:34] Sicknessqt: 380% monkaS
[2:03:37] KaisenSiru: 20 Uldaman monkaW
[2:03:40] falldrgn: china #1 A OK USA!  You just kill this raid.. we 5 raid ahead. Chairman Mao already solo 12.0 raid bosses
[2:03:40] herobreaker19: it
[2:03:50] wEiRdO_dUdE: It's easy for me... if it's good for the game overall, then do it
[2:03:51] mavericks312: Wow doesn’t need player housing stop it
[2:03:53] Myth_The_Wolf: FFXIV doesn't even kick you when weekly reset comes around
[2:03:57] 91Niki: No ijpNO It is NOT a shame
[2:04:03] Infebdo: Ye I don't feel like playing Diablo atm, this patch is too good
[2:04:05] herobreaker19: it's not. player housing is a lot of fun and a time sink into a game
[2:04:07] Myth_The_Wolf: I'd like player housing tbh
[2:04:12] Zeke_nl: this tier is nice and this patch owns, the upgrade system is gteat
[2:04:32] marineboi1288: Oh man looks like he has some juicers
[2:04:37] Zolshy89: player housing = garrisons = dog shit for the game
[2:04:44] Rudric_Ice: i stopped playing wow after week 3 of DF and i dont miss it but i just want diablo mannnn
[2:04:46] xchaoskingsx: A lot of people refunded D4 after that last server slam
[2:05:03] 91Niki: @xchaoskingsx Why? LUL
[2:05:08] wEiRdO_dUdE: I think they said in an interview that player housing is on the menu, it's just that other things are more important
[2:05:19] Chibrotle: They do.
[2:05:21] adxx: same with the bleeds in Brakenhide @Towelliee
[2:05:21] love_eggplant: they have it, 60sec cd
[2:05:22] Myth_The_Wolf: Evoker talent

[2:06:15] wEiRdO_dUdE: Cast frequency nerf is easy enough for them to do
[2:06:21] xchaoskingsx: @xchaoskingsx Cause blizzard posted a bunch of buffs to skills, everyone was hyped, but they didn't show the 100 skills they nerfed into the ground lol
[2:06:29] Zolshy89: @notorietyy KEKW
[2:06:30] Holysal: It sucks there's no leaderboard for D4

[2:07:02] Infebdo: @Holysal After season 3 they said

[2:07:35] Wiiccked: watched sloots D4 video, seems okay
[2:07:36] illStefan: asmon game d4 8.5
[2:07:36] Zolshy89: they spend more time bitching about the game
[2:07:37] mavericks312: Sounds like an asmon thing
[2:07:38] 91Niki: @Holysal Nah, it's just them testing the game out. Seeing how classes do end game, before putting a leaderboard in there
[2:07:38] Zolshy89: than playing it
[2:07:40] dankmeliodas: it was him reacting to someones video
[2:07:41] Zolshy89: KEKW
[2:07:49] 91Niki: The loud minority
[2:07:50] ArcaneSyntax: There were two shitty PC gamer articles about D4 yesterday
[2:07:52] CrossFire686: i´m hyped for D4
[2:07:56] Holysal: That poor woman being used as the fall guy for the shop was sad
[2:08:04] Wulfgrym: blah blah battle pass YAWN
[2:08:08] Rudric_Ice: asmon was bashing DRUID cuz it sucked in DMG
[2:08:10] Daarksyde: the refund D4 thing is hilarious. it's the typical "give me everything or i quit" baby talk
[2:08:10] Myth_The_Wolf: Towelliee, can you bless my solo shuffle queue? I need 65 rating to get my suit of armor complete
[2:08:15] Crunchroll0630: Ben has also passively flamed it on his stream. That might have something to do with it?
[2:08:15] Yagr6: did the microsoft blizz deal go through
[2:08:17] fistofnature: this game is 0/10 game and ill play it for 5 months straight and make dailty youtube content with it
[2:08:23] kissesaurus: because saying that something sucks will give you more clicks cause drama drama drama
[2:08:26] 91Niki: The negative people will ALWAYS be the loudest. Because the positive people are busy playing the game or getting ready for the hype
[2:08:29] wEiRdO_dUdE: I think D4 is going to be a really good game, in large part because the devs have been listening and making positive changes

[2:09:01] Wulfgrym: I actually really liked druid this last weekend felt stronger with certain skills this time.

[2:10:01] Rudric_Ice: see the thing is Asmon, Quinn they are content creators they aint nothing without creating drama content creaters need to stir drama or it aint fun
[2:10:11] xchaoskingsx: @91Niki I'm still going to play the shit out of the game, but isn't it weird for blizzard to make changes people want, but then secretly nerf a lot of other shit into the ground but not tell anyone about those changes? They hid that from their playerbase lol. Like I said though, I'm still going to play it, was just shitty of them to do that
[2:11:16] Holysal: @xchaoskingsx what was nerfed we didn't know about?
[2:11:24] Wulfgrym: im playing diablo 4 no matter how much hate the whiners throw.
[2:11:25] Talason: hows it going T
[2:11:32] Holysal: I didnt play the server slam
[2:11:40] 91Niki: @xchaoskingsx Yeah, sadly Blizzard don't have as much transparency as they should. Comparing them to GGG and the POE patch notes. Which I agree isn't super cool, but also I am the type of person who doesn't take nerfs and buffs too serious. I just play and enjoy the game, or I don't enjoy it and I don't play :p I don't rant about it online

[2:12:32] Chibrotle: nice
[2:12:33] Talason: towelliee carrying
[2:12:33] Wulfgrym: Loot drops were normalized, i think people felt weaker due to legendaries not falling out of the sky and had to play with regular gear most of hte time.

[2:12:40] isBadIRL: clean
[2:12:40] wEiRdO_dUdE: One of the big things for WoW for me was when the devs tried harder to explain why nerfs and buffs were happening, it helps us all
[2:12:40] adxx: that totem dmg is nuts

[2:22:52] 91Niki: in EU getting second is worse than getting third
[2:23:08] Blvdman: True
[2:23:14] Blvdman: 1st and 3rd at least won

[2:24:22] Buckwink: they really wanted that win
[2:24:24] kalithian2: if i remember right i dont think gear gets better beyond plus 20 so going higher than 20 is just for the prestige right????
[2:24:33] Blvdman: tuning was made for the majority, first time iv ever did a pug normal and it went smooth all the way throguh

[2:25:01] Zolshy89: @kalithian2 best gear drops from 19s for vaults you need to do 20s anything past 20 is for your dick size lol

[2:26:38] dimofodi: I think that was Roger's point. He would rather have the shitshow that was Sepulcher than what this raid was in his eyes.
[2:26:49] Cello_73: @Cello_73 :)
[2:26:51] Wulfgrym: everyone here knew EU would call the race unfair if Liquid won, lets all be real.
[2:26:53] b1z49: how long to na reset
[2:26:58] DunzoCD: halondrus was the modern day KJ lol
[2:27:09] Fortvila: But it is a bit true tho. If the next few raids will be tuned like this, were it 3 days of mythic progress is it all. Then the different resets will continue to plague the "validity" of who killed it first vs who killed it faster.
[2:27:10] captivate7: @Wulfgrym true

[3:06:18] KaisenSiru: Just dispels it off the person so theyre not slowed/taking damage
[3:06:25] Big_Oakk: its a movement debuff that drops the pool when removed @Towelliee

[3:13:00] pereadin: Interchanging doesn’t work anymore. They fixed it.

[3:13:01] propwash80: @thepawpaw how do you get the free 441?
[3:13:11] pereadin: That could be a very possible bug.
[3:13:11] NVbrutal: you have to get 2 trinks at that ilvl before you get the discount.
[3:13:13] zeeAbe: @Towelliee trinkets, rings and dual wielded weapons check BOTH slots now. For trading and upgrading. No matter the slot swapping
[3:13:15] nikola: do you have 441 helm on other characters?

[3:13:27] ThePawPaw: @propwash80 idk he just upgraded an 424 to 441 or whatever to 441 for free
[3:13:29] CeruleanStar: doesn't need to be 'upgraded' to 441, getting a 441 drop lets you upgrade to 441 for cheap
[3:13:35] zaetemira: might be the tier seet item then maybe :D
[3:13:39] DecayedmiNt: @Towelliee Look to see if you still have the crest, might've been a visual bug

[3:42:29] NVbrutal: idk what kind of tuning they want, when it takes 400+ pulls to kill last boss wouldnt you say its a bit overtuned at that point?
[3:42:34] tirraldra: I feel bad because Max is always a good sport even when they've lost and Gingi is being a poor sport about it
[3:42:38] JayPuppa: @ThePawPaw that level of content is
[3:42:39] Korupcija_: raid is a banger
[3:42:40] flebbooo: tell em Towel!
[3:42:43] mavericks312: theres more casual guilds entering mythic right now then ever before
[3:42:44] jkitchin75: just get over the lose and move on
[3:42:47] Fortvila: as a casual the tuning is decent
[3:42:58] 91Niki: Like wow doesn't spin around world first raiders
[3:42:59] ThePawPaw: @Just_Jerms idk what you saying
[3:43:10] Rudric_Ice: gingi always being a salty bitch
[3:43:14] firewalltwitch: Gingi said he hopes Max doesnt lose to method again, then got embarrassed, great content imo
[3:43:17] ArcaneSyntax: They want whatever tuning that happens when they win, that's all it is. They lost and now they're grasping at reasons why
[3:43:24] byrdeen45: did echo beat the last boss ?
[3:43:32] baaronthemonk: He's a pretty poor winner/loser
[3:43:33] firewalltwitch: Gingi got his soul ripped out lol
[3:43:39] HueyxHuey: @Towelliee im new to wow is it to late to start it?
[3:43:50] Fortvila: But we can agree that the tuning was so that they had less chance to catch up to the reset difference tho. Probally what he is talking about
[3:43:52] BigDiezel: @Towelliee gingi just mad he got caught in 4k
[3:43:58] Thoreya: @12sticks no, DF is a banger expansion
[3:43:59] PvtHudson093: I would have loved a couple of more mid raid wall bosses
[3:44:05] xeavv: Im just happy the final boss on the tier is not like 14 minutes long and will take 250/300 pulls of mythic prog
[3:44:05] firehawk73: the 1%'ers seem to have an entitled way of thinking
[3:44:08] KaisenSiru: Bring back 20 minute Heroic Sha of Fear fights Kapp
[3:44:20] Thoreya: remember gingi accusing liquid of cheating on anduin LUL LUL
[3:44:22] GalanEU: Its nice, but as a casual guild that get aotc in 10weeks on average, we already got 8/9hc in one week. Kinda sad. We going mythic I think.
[3:44:27] Blvdman: fuck wall bosses lol

[3:45:47] Wulfgrym: who really cares if they are complaining LUL
[3:45:51] GalanEU: @GalanEU we don't want to drop people for 20mans when we're 24-26
[3:45:57] 91Niki: Less work for Blizzard having to tune the raid over and over because the first week gets tuned for world first raiders.
[3:46:22] Thoreya: i think they might go back to 1 week heroic and 1 week mythic and not releasing all at th4e same time
[3:46:26] mewkittymon: We are a 3 day guild clears normal and 1 hero no tear to most of us
[3:46:31] TexValhalla: mornin fam!
[3:46:34] firewalltwitch: did u see the tweet @Towelliee , that max was mad about
[3:46:39] ZeusDNA: yeah Zskarn is super chaotic to keep up on with the fire traps and golems
[3:46:42] 91Niki: As it should be
[3:46:43] gdcotton: Throwback to Gorefiend wall in HFC for WOD that broke half the mythic guilds lol
[3:46:44] Rhumak: What if like Tournament servers  , The Top guilds get their own server with an Overtuned version of the raid  that deactivates after said event is finished
[3:46:47] vulkankragon: maybe this time this raid isn't designed by ion? he is clearly elitist
[3:46:53] Keyastaron_: @Towelliee  you thihnk youll get tier from the vault before the catalyst comes out ?>
[3:46:56] herobreaker19: their ilvl was really high though no?
[3:47:19] ThePawPaw: i have IDEA...if they want BIG tunning then ask liquid method echo to play the mythic bosses without tier and trinkets then its tunned for you all KEKW
[3:47:20] Zucchey: Did you finish that 20 uld?
[3:47:31] drpepin: Why are we in Ruby?

[3:47:57] 91Niki: @Rhumak Right but the point of world first is doing it on live servers, and that EVERYONE can compete in theory anyway. If you took it to tournament realm, suddenly it comes down to signing up for a tournament. Remember, world first raids is run by the world first raiders, not Blizzard
[3:48:03] Keyastaron_: bruh lmao
[3:48:04] tydrennistv: did ion quit wow? his ccharacter doesnt show on the armory anymore
[3:48:07] c0mmander_starscream: Ion is like the used card saleman off the 1&9 in Jersey
[3:48:10] TexValhalla: it's been a long time since i have seen the raid completed before reset and this tier we have 2 guilds and maybe 3 with Method tbh
[3:48:20] c0mmander_starscream: car*
[3:48:20] fentyy1: !drop
[3:48:38] ThePawPaw: Sylvanas?

[3:48:47] Exodeo_: Crucible of Storms? Kappa
[3:48:51] Ch0pples: jaina?
[3:48:52] Rudric_Ice: if WF raiders really want tough ass bosses i think blizzard can push that stuff on Tournament server
[3:48:53] DecayedmiNt: EN was an extreme case since it was 24 hours

[3:49:29] chowzter: I believe
[3:49:30] Thoreya: jaina was a cool fight
[3:49:49] wEiRdO_dUdE: Ion is doing alright, I think
[3:49:50] Crunchroll0630: I thought the MS deal was tabled?

[3:50:44] tydrennistv: im waiting for wow to be on xbox
[3:50:53] tydrennistv: ill buy one right away if it ddoes
[3:50:53] Armdel: activision CEO just answers to someone else now
[3:50:55] falldrgn: the purchase will be more on the business side., shouldn't affect WoW or Blizzard for day to day operationhs
[3:51:07] Amarlian: Yeah it's usually just the shared services that get hit. HR, Accounts payable and the like @Towelliee
[3:51:07] PYRO_MANI8C: gingi is getting lit up by his own fans on twitter right now its not a good look
[3:51:08] xeavv: If anything MS can just surge more resources to Blizzard for development purposes
[3:51:14] Holysal: @Armdel bobby
[3:51:14] hidetsugus2ndbaseman: Yeah when they bought us they just own us and we just count as microsoft employees

[3:51:27] szeeman62: @towelliee I’m just hoping Amazon does a good job with the newly announced lord of the rings mmo
[3:51:51] Theduskflyer: Big buy outs like that, typically it’s higher upper management that gets pushed out
[3:51:51] Holysal: @NVbrutal  bc of addons

[3:52:10] firewalltwitch: they got out played hard

[3:54:19] vulkankragon: i bet ms will aggressively change the direction and design of wow to attract more players. phil spencer said in an interview that he wants more ppl tp play wow.
[3:54:33] BrothaLatinoHeat76: Cool down time until next race, I guess...
[3:54:35] im_capy: if only some of the crypto boys had a hard on for RWF

[4:04:47] WrexOfficial: @zorantt thats what i wanna know
[4:04:58] Phantomstrk: now toweliee, it isn't the gameplay, or the healing or the strat, it was clearly not having global release..cmon now..stop it...haha
[4:04:58] vulkankragon: whatever happened to wwe nowadays?
[4:05:01] deaddwarfwalking: be humble in victory and gracious in defeat
[4:05:03] 91Niki: @Holysal Oh I am aware. I am from EU and I hate sports here for that reason KEKW
[4:05:07] DallTV_: yeah to meny personal mistakes idd
[4:05:11] faulen: Wrong P3 strat too
[4:05:16] PYRO_MANI8C: i think pulling off stream was a big W for liquid
[4:05:28] kalithian2: it was really close, i heard echo had him at 5% when liquid killed it
[4:05:32] CrusaderNero: @91Niki like its different in sports in literally any other part of the world
[4:05:37] firehawk73: 100%
[4:05:39] audrock7: no
[4:05:41] BoezIRL: @91Niki don't generalize to EU, everyone does that no matter where you from
[4:05:58] N3llee: Liquid had the better strat
[4:06:00] N3llee: 100%
[4:06:07] WrexOfficial: when does the ptr servers come back up?

[4:06:20] audrock7: they copy each others strats 100%
[4:06:21] faulen: Echo would have won 100%
[4:06:24] CarrKinn: 100%. when liquid came out with the 14% after shutting streams off. That shook them. They didnt have the strat that liquid had and they had no idea what to do.

[4:06:35] Thewunk: Echo got SMACKED
[4:06:36] Experiia: Max said the GM of liquid gave them the go ahead to shit the streams off and Max said say less.
[4:06:40] 91Niki: @CrusaderNero Oh for sure, there are sore losers everywhere. But trust me when I say, EU is BAD when it comes to being salty losers
[4:06:43] WrexOfficial: liquid played fair game.
[4:06:48] YOLOiGOTSWAG: -
[4:06:53] captain_khyzan: Echo looked way more chaotic and less organized
[4:06:54] SpoofAvatar: they didn't have liquid to shows them what to do
[4:06:54] Phantomstrk: i wanna go back and watch the broadcast for the moment echo realized the 14.4 l
[4:06:56] rLeo2: Max calling off streaming to prog is the win condition
[4:06:56] JayPuppa: again, max/analysts were the diff
[4:06:58] xmirrxrs: Echo changed thier comp and start after they saw the new liquid strat
[4:06:58] ThePawPaw: @Towelliee i mean ECHO could shut down there prog on last boss day 1 too so it is what it is....
[4:06:59] abracka_: they are really frazzled over this lol
[4:07:00] faulen: there were flabbergasted to see Liquid at 14%
[4:07:02] duffluv22: Did Echo sacrificed a person like Limit?
[4:07:04] NobodybetterPat: lol do ittt
[4:07:06] CarrKinn: They were doomed when liquid turned their streams on and had a 14% in their back pocket
[4:07:07] captain_khyzan: liquid was very organized and moved together well
[4:07:08] Sttarrkz: 100% your vault gives a helmet

[4:07:45] FaxFeller: Max said on stream yesterday that some kind of Manager allowed them to go offline, so they took their chance.
[4:07:50] ElmSpace: Echo turned off stream before reset during Castle Nathria for a whole day
[4:07:53] CrusaderNero: @91Niki jesus christ
[4:07:55] ThePawPaw: @91Niki i mean where were ECHO when they win after the last boss got nerfed/fixed 10 times in 1 hour and they win than Limit to woke up on BS....nobody said anything that time righr

[4:08:28] Rudric_Ice: yep i was right
[4:08:33] 91Niki: @91Niki Oh gotcha! But yeah, EU sports fans have a track record of being sore losers. Especially in football. My god the amount of children KEKW even between local clubs

[4:10:17] Zellidon: The biggest difference between NA and EU is grade school sports. Most countries in EU don't have grade school sports and it kinda shows. When I look at Echo I don't see the same team comradery that Liquid has.

[4:21:25] NestLucky: in the liquid, echo and method raid group dont use a only hunter for the kill so much horrible is that class right now?
[4:21:27] DecayedmiNt: Liquid and Echo poach, and when raiders retire from those guilds they go back down
[4:21:28] N3llee: funny thing is Darkee missed this race with Echo cause they ran out of time neg. his contract.
[4:21:30] 0doz: Method was a lot more competitive this tier
[4:21:36] dyslexican1: Has anyone else had as much fun trolling Echo copium fanboys as I have this morning? There are some real rage babies on reddit this morning lol
[4:21:40] theDirtyon3: ID is Liquid retirement home though KEKW
[4:21:44] Thoreya: instant dollars wont, theyre all ex liquid players who dont wanna rwf
[4:21:52] Heracy: peepoHey fam Hope you're all well today!!!! :) <3

[4:22:29] Vahs_Redclaw: i was watching him last night after sang
[4:22:30] captivate7: Max said Ben retired after last tier
[4:22:30] ThePawPaw: @Effin_Steffin i think uldaman trinket
[4:22:32] ElmSpace: dorki was negotiating a contract with Liquid
[4:22:33] theDirtyon3: Dorki was the one who was negotiating
[4:22:33] Thoreya: bro ben is a savage
[4:22:38] Blvdman: Making custom W/A for a guild for a fight, if you had those skills you may as well apply for a Data Analyst position
[4:22:40] theDirtyon3: that guy is confused
[4:22:41] ZeusDNA: Bro meant Liquid and he meant Dorki
[4:22:43] captivate7: Dorki was gonna tank for Liquid, yes
[4:22:44] DarthWrex: yeah, I thought Ben retired
[4:22:44] Hypertitan: ben retired....he was talking about dorki
[4:22:47] Vahs_Redclaw: hes happily playing PoE
[4:22:48] Armdel: Echo liquid its all the same
[4:22:53] Vahs_Redclaw: people are cooked

[4:22:53] censati0n_: Dorki was the one trying to be on Liquid
[4:22:55] theDirtyon3: Ben is not Dorki
[4:22:56] censati0n_: Ben retired
[4:22:57] DecayedmiNt: Ben flat out said he quit after Raz nerfs last race
[4:23:01] DunzoCD: max said ben wont come back it was his last straw when they nerfed the boss
[4:23:02] Blvdman: Aye we took Ben into the PoE club
[4:23:04] ZeusDNA: @Towelliee He meant Dorki and for Liquid

[4:23:10] kalithian2: ouch, damn this boss hurts, the healers have their work cut out for them
[4:23:10] Draz3nx: Ben quit because of Blizzard nerf to the last boss of last expansion
[4:23:13] Mallaes: Who's Ben?
[4:23:15] Vahs_Redclaw: that makes a lot more sense
[4:23:19] Holysal: ben quit on the spot after the raz nerf
[4:23:22] Armdel: Darkee is just ben these days no?
[4:23:23] ElmSpace: Ben (Darkee) left liquid
[4:23:25] theDirtyon3: Ben is Ben
[4:23:31] 6all: ben one of best gamers in the world
[4:23:38] Mallaes: Ok
[4:23:39] Arsidias: nah ben is better than lightee

[4:23:44] Arsidias: but darkee is the best of all time
[4:23:44] mavericks312: and if you notice liquid also didnt have trill this race either due to arena obligations
[4:23:54] Voltsicle: rip evade
[4:23:57] falldrgn: and hes also making $$$ doing POE
[4:24:00] CarrKinn: ben is still heavily involved with the guild, though.
[4:24:03] Holysal: Ben is great at any games he plays
[4:24:05] WrexOfficial: when does ptr realms come back on? @Towelliee

[4:24:10] Chibrotle: @mavericks312 trill stepped down my guy
[4:24:10] exilezor: Devillien subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 53 months! 
[4:24:12] Thoreya: liquid didnt need trill this tier
[4:24:14] Thoreya: bc ww is garbo
[4:24:18] Korupcija_: RIP retail on twitch after rwf :(
[4:24:19] theDirtyon3: Chatters are chatting this AM KEKW
[4:24:25] theDirtyon3: hholy misinformation
[4:24:25] dimofodi: A sponsor isn't all that matters though. They would have to generate a larger fanbase like Echo and Liquid to be able to compete with splits etc. That means they'd likely have to siphon fans from the others to them which is going to be hard also. @Towelliee
[4:24:26] ShadowDMG6969: So someone wanna Explain why he left after the Raz nerf??
[4:24:31] Thoreya: @Chibrotle bc of awc
[4:24:36] falldrgn: Trill can play anything
[4:24:37] DunzoCD: yeah max said it was a good tier for trill to take off since ww wasnt very good
[4:24:39] Sharkeys: how bad was the razageth nerf that he quit on the spot like that
[4:24:39] Holysal: @ShadowDMG6969 fed up with blizzard
[4:24:41] Chibrotle: false
[4:24:43] flebbooo: Dorki is a cat tho
[4:24:44] mavericks312: @Chibrotle thought he just missed this tier due to arena and pvp issues max said
[4:24:51] CarrKinn: @ShadowDMG6969 beacuse he was pissed off
[4:24:52] N3llee: Overall that race was good I thought. When is the last time we saw top 10 guilds 7/9 or higher on week 1
[4:24:58] im_capy: He prob makes good money doing twitch and YT to dedicate more time
[4:24:58] Thoreya: trill didnt want to play anything other than ww, and said he wanted to focus on irl/awc
[4:25:00] JStevenson: where was trill this race?  Just noticed that when you said it
[4:25:05] PYRO_MANI8C: dorki has every tank pushing 20s right now
[4:25:07] Holysal: @ShadowDMG6969 hes not even playing d4

[4:25:28] theDirtyon3: Trill will be back im sure
[4:25:29] Thoreya: @JStevenson only wanted to play WW, and wanted to focus on awc
[4:25:30] Thoreya: this tier
[4:25:30] DecayedmiNt: @ShadowDMG6969 Last straw. Nerfing the boss while they were sleeping
[4:25:35] DunzoCD: trill is focusing on pvp this tier
[4:25:38] catlinv: wa
[4:25:51] PYRO_MANI8C: trill wanted to focus on pvp according to max yesterday
[4:25:53] mavericks312: imagine trill next tier with these slappers from abberus

[4:25:58] ShadowDMG6969: Damn Gotcha
[4:26:06] KShellZx: do we know why maintenance is longer today?

[4:46:34] ChuckyTrees: In terms of what? He was a WF raider Multi times
[4:46:36] icecold40oz: @falldrgn acting like tanking is hard at all

[5:01:50] reggiepowa: no way they dont do .3 patch again
[5:01:51] BoezIRL: teaser at gamescon and full cinematic at blizzcon?
[5:01:53] jkitchin75: fated
[5:01:58] xxsargexx: i thought the end cinematic was alright, not the best they've done but it got the point across to wrathion and bro that neltharions legacy brings only death
[5:02:07] Zanderion: is it just me or is DF gearing up to be the best expansion ever? I've been on and off of the game for years and this has been the longest I've been locked in. @Towelliee
[5:02:08] TexValhalla: maybe a 2 boss raid last tier patch like bfa had before as well
[5:02:15] Korupcija_: wow 2 announcement
[5:02:19] im_capy: Wonder what ticket prices will be this time around
[5:02:20] TexValhalla: even though it wasn't the last patch
[5:02:22] elitistdk: @Holysal yea its what the kappa was for
[5:02:27] Hookem70: Echo will lose 2-3 good players, go to Method and Method will win 10.2 RWF.  Heard it here first.
[5:02:31] Zanderion: doing the full gamut too, m+, raiding, some pvp. The whole thing has been great.
[5:02:32] flebbooo: KEKW
[5:02:38] PigPenLen: after D4 cinematics the bar has been set high

[5:03:05] Maydie6066: @Towelliee i was hoping for some 5000iq Jailor plot still
[5:03:10] mavericks312: it was basically telling wrathion and sabellian only death follows neltharions legacy
[5:03:16] Reckless_Monk: Was suppose to show their fate if they kept running after Neltharions legacy
[5:03:26] Rudric_Ice: what happened to CGI cinematics we had so many in BFA now its completely  gone
[5:03:29] SuperLost89: @Towelliee imagine if there is a secret on how to unlock another boss inside the raid. that would be cool

[5:03:37] im_capy: SL Varian scene is the worst for me
[5:03:40] Valestrus: new cinematic at the end of the last chapter to make the end-of-raid one make more sense tbh
[5:03:41] smashwow: i mean at least it kinda follows the story. was it big like the others, no. but i think it was the capstone of that story. great, eh. complete *shrug*.
[5:03:44] sephronz: tbh it was a bit disappointing; too anticlimactic ... needed something else imho
[5:03:44] akia03: is there still a free upgrade bit at the end of the campaign?
[5:03:46] Redpandalol: Sarc fell to the ground and was like fuck you guys and fuck you dad -fade to black-

[5:06:34] Maydie6066: @Towelliee pretty sure the cinematic could have been like 1000% better if at the end there was a whisper that both Sabell and Wrathion heard and like startled them

[5:27:16] pilhass10: it's actually sad
[5:27:18] polotakos: Soooo now what do we do lol
[5:27:18] im_n0t_jezus: That offstreeam pulls liquid called before the kill was SUPER Crucial
[5:27:19] Bernardo994: zone*
[5:27:20] pbnj_kills: is he suggesting echo doesnt copy liquids strats until they catch up? LUL
[5:27:20] Oceansevan: let EU bug test bosses and get their strats YOINKED

[5:27:23] Rudric_Ice: dude everytime same ass BANTER
[5:27:26] GodKingMuninn: only time the time start difference matters is on that first tuesday reset
[5:27:28] HopeThePriest: I just got here. Echo not so great when Liquid doesnt figure shit out for them at the end. I dont think either should stream last boss
[5:27:33] darssia_: Do they ever get tired of having this conversation?
[5:27:33] madhatterui: same shit everytime
[5:27:34] xhale2nhale: TBH didn't Liquid start when Echo did after running keys n such
[5:27:35] Lastprayer: Gingi is Salty.  Echo doesn’t know how to lose gracefully 😂
[5:27:36] SherriJade: Echo: 140+ pulls..Liquid: 114 pulls.. not sure if it matters if they start at the same time if they do it in different amount of pulls.
[5:27:39] Zeke_nl: all the headstart stuff is cringe, just say gg and move on
[5:27:40] kevnil: TRUE
[5:27:40] dreamwalker213: Echo wins: head start means nothing Echo loses: wahhhh global release

[5:27:56] baaronthemonk: agreed. bunch of terrible losers
[5:27:58] faulen: usually in the same tweet!

[5:28:39] Mostdangspy: Wasn't it Echo who got the boss Nerf before liquid in the last tier?
[5:28:39] 91Niki: Self reflections is nowhere to be found
[5:28:40] Rudric_Ice: adult kids can't help it
[5:28:46] xxsargexx: doesnt EU have like the most WF's in WoWs lifespan anyway lol
[5:28:47] mavericks312: most of liquid handles there Ls
[5:28:48] smashwow: echo gets memory loss about that time difference when they win
[5:28:48] faulen: Its usually in the same tweet!
[5:28:49] Foxdoabarrelrofl: @captain_khyzan yea max tried to activate his twitter immediately after to troll him but couldnt log in lmfao

[5:28:54] Broomba: Its the old same old addage -- true, but......
[5:28:56] tdpark_: Liquid does it , no?
[5:28:58] TakeThatBack: Maybe its scripted drama, cause drama = views towIgnit
[5:28:59] wEiRdO_dUdE: I'm a little surprised no one has claimed "rigged" this time
[5:29:01] soysos91: Take the L
[5:29:05] essehbee: liquid spanked EU
[5:29:07] soysos91: and do better next time :D

[5:29:09] udk3_dev: if echo are flaming the late start neckbeard fire...
[5:29:11] Oceansevan: Pretty sure Max admits when Liquid plays like dog doo
[5:29:13] reggiepowa: thats not andys fault
[5:29:13] itimetraveled: well US does have an advantage every tier , time wise
[5:29:19] mavericks312: echo needs to boots them fucking healers they brought lol
[5:29:27] stridro: very little
[5:29:28] Baybe_Jesus: !drops
[5:29:28] reggiepowa: naowh would die just as much as andy
[5:29:28] im_n0t_jezus: Liquid had better strat over all

[5:29:30] Bullety: yea on last boss they had a few tank issues
[5:29:30] ZeusDNA: Yeah their tanks died a little bit
[5:29:31] marineboi1288: i think echo had more tank deaths
[5:29:32] tydrennistv: Eu takes it extra bad when NA wins if method would of won it would of been much different response from Echo then what was said about liquid winning
[5:29:32] PYRO_MANI8C: not really
[5:29:33] Zeke_nl: its hard to believe they find a better tank than Andy
[5:29:33] im_n0t_jezus: simple outplayed
[5:29:33] Bullety: liquid did
[5:29:36] xxsargexx: @Oceansevan he does and he also says when Echo plays better then them
[5:29:39] Naturalbeef: Naowh will be back next tier
[5:29:39] dimofodi: Meeres deaths were usually due to their strategy and getting clapped by adds going into phase 3.
[5:29:44] falldrgn: Meeres idk.. was SUPER squishy
[5:29:45] Foxdoabarrelrofl: @itimetraveled yea and echo immediately copies strats to catch up
[5:29:46] mavericks312: @itimetraveled do they cry time advantage when they were 3 peating?
[5:29:47] Snabido: Overconfidence CoolCat
[5:29:49] Zeke_nl: they said they were tilted when they saw 14%
[5:29:51] Cabbageman007: slootSmug slootSmug is gonna be recruited
[5:30:00] herobreaker19: yea the BM when he was the only one up top for a bit
[5:30:05] Dyasis: Echo kept changing their strat, changing lust from phase to phase, changing comp several times
[5:30:08] c0mmander_starscream: Shit, that's sounds like a night out in town with hookers and blow.
[5:30:09] tydrennistv: i genuinlely believe EU guilds dont respect na guilds. which is the biggest issue

[5:30:10] im_n0t_jezus: the Stratego of Max and liquid was best
[5:30:11] TheFruitee: Gamers vs professional athletes haven't been trained for PR, or have been only very recently, so they end up always yapping and yapping around
[5:30:14] MereMortal: Liquid doesn't stream their final strat, then Echo doesn't know what to do Kappa
[5:30:14] Lastprayer: Who is Andy again? Lol
[5:30:17] essehbee: liquid has the best player in the world though, firedup kinda unfair
[5:30:21] Tex1090: They saw 14% and a 6am wake-up on Liquid and just crumbled
[5:30:27] Rudric_Ice: next time be the main tank of echo tow
[5:30:35] Dcarter: i hope they keep doing it troo
[5:30:37] xmedpakx: I love that liquid hid their stream to play, as much as it hurts views it helped them keep their strats to themselves
[5:30:39] mavericks312: listen when liquid got on a 6am with a 14% pull that totally killed echo
[5:30:40] Dcarter: dont show the final strat
[5:30:44] Foxdoabarrelrofl: @Dyasis yea because they had no idea what the strat was and couldnt copy it. as soon as liquid went dark echo started sweating
[5:30:45] Moobot:  The website has gotten a...hellish..makeoever https://www.towelliee.com/ to keep updated on everything that's going on with the WoW:DF Marathons. Backgrounds, goals and giveaways, talents and UI we have it all!
[5:30:55] enigmasvea: Echo turned their stream off on sire, so who the fuck cares LUL
[5:30:55] Sollice: @essehbee Doesnt one guild always normally have the best player in the world on tyheir team lol
[5:30:58] sl1nky1981: @essehbee Firedup should be banned or Liquid should have to play with 19 to make it fair LUL Kappa
[5:31:01] Lastprayer: True
[5:31:02] Yagr6: preach changed his mood real quick
[5:31:05] mavericks312: i hope max kills the stream on every last boss now force echo to make there own strats
[5:31:06] xxsargexx: its unfortunate that chatters are trying to start shit between Max and Echo cuz they kept saying to Scripe that he hates them all when thats not true and they seem to believe it
[5:31:06] Moobot:  Check out Towelliee's YouTube channel! You can view the most recent uploaded video HERE || Custom Figurine in World of Warcraft youtu.be/SS6LcFmgXJk
[5:31:13] marineboi1288: gingi kept dieing alot this tier
[5:31:15] Karbonn: Limit played SMART. Turning off stream for a little and waking up early. HUGE plays.
[5:31:17] Yulya_Oh: just go back when no one streamed RWF
[5:31:23] Oceansevan: for all the complaining Echo does about the head start, put out a global release, but ban inter-guild observation and see what happens. seems to me Liquid is WAY ahead on strat development
[5:31:28] Sollice: Their rogue had a lot of death issues also
[5:31:28] Lastprayer: Preach bias casting was a bit cringe lol
[5:31:28] soysos91: Max said THD 5headed that play; the strat
[5:31:30] Zeke_nl: its all so hilarious, they lost and they just make excuses
[5:31:33] joe_g_433: I think that’s proven by their kill time 6 hours later….
[5:31:33] xhale2nhale: way I see it Liquid try to get some enjoyment out of the seriousness while Echo just go full on mute/serious/unfun, gotta relex n play but thats just me
[5:31:33] BobbyBones: what you think that electric bill looking like?
[5:31:39] Foxdoabarrelrofl: @Towelliee when they found out they went dark they were shook because they couldnt steal strats
[5:31:41] im_n0t_jezus: maybe sctibe lost the lockeroom
[5:31:45] mavericks312: liquid werent having dumbass deaths this tier thats the difference as well
[5:31:49] adxx: its like all sports or competition, when you are focused more on your competition and not your performance, you are already behind
[5:31:51] reggiepowa: who is methods raid leader btw
[5:31:51] joe_g_433: @lastprayer always…
[5:31:54] jezaknight93: its would be nice to see what would happen if both team started at the same time as both guild are unreal at this game :D
[5:31:58] xxsargexx: i think max said it was the general managers idea if they wanted to shut the stream off they could and max didnt even think about it until he mentioned it
[5:32:06] Zeke_nl: max said they had 3-4 hours sleep
[5:32:10] Reckless_Monk: Firdup is the best plaer in the world
[5:32:12] volkreig: Biff
[5:32:13] Zeke_nl: biff
[5:32:13] Mattyboh: sco?
[5:32:15] Okeywan: Liquid also spent less time in boss attempts across the raid and Sarkareth. Liquid played better throughout, regardless of region zoning.
[5:32:16] Foxdoabarrelrofl: maybe in the end echo is very good at perfecting liquids strats lol
[5:32:17] sl1nky1981: @xxsargexx Yup, that's what he said

[5:32:45] soysos91: I think it was cool the Liquid manager or whoever said they could turn off stream so no one could see it; even tho viewership was gonna go down.
[5:32:46] TheCliffyShow: So, I guess BDG will be the next to down it.
[5:33:09] volkreig: Echo didn’t react well enough

[5:33:10] mavericks312: bdg or instant dollars will be next
[5:33:17] Foxdoabarrelrofl: @Towelliee thats my point they did nothing until liquid showed them the strat THEN they were able to push the boss
[5:33:22] pbnj_kills: echo couldnt get through 28% until liquid started streaming again
[5:33:31] Foxdoabarrelrofl: got caught with their pants down
[5:33:33] TheFruitee: Echo seemed unprepared compared to the last 2 tiers

[5:33:45] mavericks312: i think this race showed flaws in how echo does its own strats
[5:33:47] Lastprayer: Echo just comes off super immature and I’m glad they have to let it stew for months lol.
[5:33:51] Qvazar: !drops
[5:33:54] TheCliffyShow: @mavericks312 BDG has a good lead on Instant Dollars. I say they are next. How long it will take is the question.
[5:34:06] BlinkHeals: I still think gingi is best player in PVE wow
[5:34:08] kevnil: @Towelliee like it doesnt matter what guild do what, like liquid and echo have shut down their streams and they both have taken each others starts etc but still ppl always trying to make it that it never happens etc so stupid
[5:34:10] shmerek_: I'm just glad Liquid got a win solely on how the last race ended
[5:34:15] volkreig: Echo will come back stronger now and the competition will be even better
[5:34:19] Lastprayer: Let’s be real though, Lipp on ret was the difference maker the whole tier ;)
[5:34:22] Holysal: @BlinkHeals he is not
[5:34:38] BlinkHeals: @Holysal says you?
[5:34:45] Mattyboh: I wanna know where Max ran off to after the kill. I like didnt see where he went ha
[5:34:45] kevnil: never
[5:34:49] mavericks312: listen after how the vault race ended im not shokced liquid came out on fire
[5:34:52] Holysal: @BlinkHeals he a great player but no the best
[5:34:54] tuggsmash: So you are is over then? I been working like crazy and not able to check I.
[5:34:55] herobreaker19: @mavericks312 for this boss not all together. each boss brings its own puzzle to solve. Liquid ruled this tier on planning and executing
[5:34:58] Oceansevan: Lihivum
[5:34:59] im_n0t_jezus: Didnt Liquid get 1st for all the last 5-6 bosses ?
[5:35:00] PYRO_MANI8C: @BlinkHeals firedup has better stats
[5:35:01] psycrow172: Echo lives true to its name. Just an Echo
[5:35:03] Arcon_LP: Arcon_LP subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 51 months! 
[5:35:03] TheFruitee: Liquid's tanks put on a clinic vs Sarkareth
[5:35:03] cazhually: Confused why?
[5:35:03] murphyb913: when liquid started competition mode at 6am it shook them pretty hard
[5:35:04] shmerek_: @Mattyboh He ran off to the other rooms to hug the players after he threw his headset KEKW
[5:35:05] Draz3nx: I wonder if losing Robin caused some of that @Towelliee
[5:35:05] birdnorf: Dazed and Confused :lull
[5:35:07] xhale2nhale: Liquid lost the last tier but picked themselves up n came back stronger but Echo seems hurt
[5:35:12] MereMortal: That was a different Scripe from any Scripe before, including the Method days
[5:35:14] BoezIRL: @Mattyboh to the other players
[5:35:16] Naturalbeef: I found it strange that nobody factored Diablo 4 release into the raid tuning equation

[5:35:57] Videli: @Towelliee  how's the diet/TRT going for you?
[5:35:59] xxsargexx: @xhale2nhale i think the fact they won the last 3 in a row played a part. overconfidence perhaps and now they are extremely salty which is unfortunate
[5:36:02] Holysal: @Naturalbeef yep. and did you see the wrath classic season ends the 29th too
[5:36:10] angahax: Lol look at jdotb take I love that dude

[5:36:43] herobreaker19: @cazhually Caused what? Limit played better
[5:36:43] cazhually: Lorgok was the glue
[5:36:48] BoezIRL: they always had the dk die in phase 2 too
[5:36:49] UserTerminated: this tier was baby mode

[5:37:29] xhale2nhale: Just raid to raid
[5:37:34] all_the_tanks: I like the lack of 15 minute fights though
[5:37:36] Dcarter: so next tier will be harder
[5:37:37] Foxdoabarrelrofl: @Reckless_Monk Scripe was throwing a fucking fit. They got made to look stupid bc they didnt see Liquids strat before liquid went to bed. Liquid should do that shit every tier
[5:37:38] shmerek_: Raid seemed undertuned, especially with the last minute buffs to the last 2 bosses after Magmorax
[5:37:41] apheelia96: Just got here. is there a reason we cant hear the background video?
[5:37:44] K4shira: mwayM <3
[5:37:46] udk3_dev: think so
[5:37:48] hammack52: am i the only one that can only hear towelliee and not what he is watching
[5:37:49] BlinkHeals: I feel ike a 9 day raid would be prefect
[5:37:54] Punk611: Pulls
[5:37:55] Djfarmville: WAYTOODANK information
[5:37:56] Reckless_Monk: New system for gearing changed the race
[5:37:58] K4shira: pulls yeah
[5:38:02] shmerek_: Pull guesses vs actual
[5:38:02] akia03: still think bliz will make raids eassier so more people stick around longer and raid  more
[5:38:05] dimofodi: Far right column is total pulls for the whole race
[5:38:08] Gingerprimer: CN is the perfect Length for me tbh
[5:38:14] Oceansevan: 19 pulls i s impressive even with strat knowledge
[5:38:16] Dcarter: yeah
[5:38:23] im_n0t_jezus: the new system ROCKS
[5:38:24] shmerek_: 100% had a factor
[5:38:25] UserTerminated: From a heroic raider's perspective... I really think it was because of the whole new upgrade system. They probably didn't expect people to be at the ilvl they can be at.
[5:38:29] Punk611: The ilvl was the closest it's probably ever been.
[5:38:31] xrandomdoodx: I think the crest system is great
[5:38:35] lumaday: gear was really powerful
[5:38:35] Dcarter: its a great system no doubt
[5:38:44] Reckless_Monk: Way more power aquisition
[5:38:44] angahax: He’s hilarious

[5:38:46] cazhually: Scripe actually showed he wasn’t as prepared as usual
[5:38:48] joe_g_433: Hearing system doesn’t matter. No matter what they will do whatever they have to. Degen or not lol
[5:38:49] Dcarter: but they geared way better than normal
[5:38:50] xxsargexx: you think D4 played a part in how short/easy this tier was? like they want as many people as possible to complete the raid before it comes out?
[5:38:52] xhale2nhale: folks gotta remember these are some the best guild running, so we can say what Undertuned or tuned from a viewers point, but it's gonna be hell nerf when we run it
[5:38:53] joe_g_433: Gearing*
[5:38:56] subarUWUw: PogChamp its towelliee
[5:38:56] Karbonn: I love the new crest system.
[5:38:56] faulen: actually a based take this time
[5:38:58] mavericks312: the crest system was an amazing decision
[5:39:01] Whiskey_Corin: SLG in Nasthria took ~230 attempts
[5:39:09] adxx: between splits and pieces of gear that can use multiple or one type of crest I think got them the dmg they needed sooner, along with tier sets
[5:39:10] TexValhalla: love that he's just chillin with a brewski LUL
[5:39:17] Foxdoabarrelrofl: @cazhually it seems like he gets a lot of preparation from liquid strats lmao
[5:39:17] BlinkHeals: jdotb i watch him alot becuase hes good but he never seems happy
[5:39:20] PigPenLen: great take
[5:39:21] Dcarter: adxx gets it

[5:40:00] fardarismai: @xhale2nhale if you listen to max's review...it was  less pulls because the fight was only 7ish minutes, but it was still a really hard boss because it is still technically difficult
[5:40:01] Red_Dead_Redeem: I love the new crest system

[5:44:30] BoezIRL: @akia03 like only 1% will get it
[5:44:35] mavericks312: make frost mages great again!!
[5:44:38] hammack52: hunters are also the only class that uses ranged weapons
[5:44:42] chuckymcbuckets: i feel like because the legendary buffs other players, it's not going to effect dev evoker tuning all that much
[5:44:46] BlinkHeals: @BoezIRL it drops on any difficulty now
[5:44:46] zeeAbe: Bows and daggers always get leggos because they are the easiest to design as they are only used by one class
[5:44:55] BubbaChubbs420: they will be OP at the start i bet
[5:45:04] faulen: yeah it was an actually based take this time from JB
[5:45:07] DecayedmiNt: If Liquid wins. Tier was easy Kappa
[5:45:10] mavericks312: WoW players dont know wtf they want
[5:45:11] twisteryz: @Holysal i was like i hope thats what you mean
[5:45:16] TheCliffyShow: Make a Survival Hunter legendary to really fuck with people.
[5:45:21] akia03: @BoezIRL  ya like hunter bow from raz hunter were tuned like all had it

[5:45:49] soysos91: It's Wildstar all over again!
[5:45:53] Punk611: Over 200 pulls is to much, 300+ is ridiculous. 100-200 in week 1 is good I think.

[5:45:56] mavericks312: @notColt45 heroic? hell most are just waiting for LFR sarkareth lol
[5:45:56] AlphasaurusRexx: I think this difficulty was solid. Long enough into the reset for 3 top guilds to be neck and neck on last boss, but short enough to not go into the next reset
[5:46:00] Etzli_GG: Do you think it makes sense to create a new level of difficulty specifically for guilds that wnat totake part in the RWF or would that take too much work for too little return?
[5:46:01] BubbaChubbs420: i have no issues with i
[5:46:03] stridro: i felt like it was great
[5:46:03] Bernardo994: agree
[5:46:07] hide_or_i_kill_u: i think other than magmorax this thing was tuned well
[5:46:11] BlinkHeals: I think they should of made the first few bosses take like 30-40 pulls not 1

[5:46:54] fistofnature: @Towelliee did you open up your vault yet?
[5:47:00] Punk611: You have to think about the content release schedule. They don't have time to fine tune a 15 minute 3 phase and secret phase final boss.

[5:47:02] hammack52: i mean you really cant use the RWF guilds to gage how a boss is tuned, i mean how many guilds out there are really going to do 30 to 50 splits to get gear before they go in
[5:47:05] marineboi1288: i just noticed that liquids 4 healers had the very rare trinket from the first boss
[5:47:12] DunzoCD: does Lost Ark still do that too?
[5:47:12] amy_star_a: I thought it was fine, not mad that we didn’t get reset and a whole second round of splits
[5:47:14] n4tur4lsmoke420: to be honest blizz is just top dog with mmorpg!!
[5:47:21] DecayedmiNt: @its_cuban_b No. Even Max thinks they shouldnt tune the raid towards them.
[5:47:26] LemmingsOCE: @marineboi1288 And Rashok trinket, pretty insane
[5:47:26] 6all: I love the tuning of this raid. It's allowing people to pug heroic week one so many people who don't have guilds can experience some more difficult content. It will also take guilds a while to get CE. @Towelliee

[5:47:37] akia03: @BoezIRL  this lego drops in all difficulties aswel not sure about vault
[5:47:38] Rexialiton: I still hope that in 11.0's expansion, there will be global release
[5:47:43] soysos91: What IS the reason there's no same global release and same maintenance days?
[5:47:48] chinfu303: im not gonna lie reading twitter is fun right now so much salt to laugh at
[5:47:49] its____rooster: Mythic phases are usually only for bosses at the end of an expansion not at the beginning or in the middle
[5:47:49] Dcarter: i mean tbh keep the difficulty like this liquid never loses lol
[5:47:55] TheGiant99: What would motivate blizzard to change a system for something they are not really even promoting
[5:47:55] mavericks312: this raid tier there was really only one boss that was fucked and thats magmorax
[5:47:55] smashwow: a 30 day boss we got a problem
[5:47:58] BurtMacklin410: @Towelliee What time of day would they do a global launch to make it the most fair?

[5:48:30] BoezIRL: @akia03 you drop the item to start a quest, if you don't have the resources to craft it it's useless
[5:48:31] smashwow: i think this raid was all new devs right? first time making an encounter?
[5:48:32] 6all: @Djfarmville KEKW
[5:48:32] AlphasaurusRexx: Did we get any lore on why Sarkareth had void powerrs or is he going into the dungeon and forgotten about
[5:48:39] herobreaker19: @Dcarter nooooooooo, I like the back and forth! Better rivalry then most mainstream sports
[5:48:52] visaeris412: do you think the whole head start argument has merit? personally i think if you do a bunch of splits, it doesnt really make that much of a difference
[5:48:53] Alsparq: @Towelliee Do you think Blizz should focus on what the viewers want to see not the guilds as guilds will only like the ones they win?
[5:49:01] Dcarter: oh i dont care one way or the other how they tune it

[5:49:02] shimwood: I want a shorter race because that means my guild can clear faster and I can dedicate my time to something else
[5:49:04] EnragedSushi: What about when it comes to dinner breaks?  What are you thoughts on that?
[5:49:05] soysos91: @6all gotcha; I figured it's a technical thing, thx
[5:49:09] Dcarter: im not a world first raider so i dont give two flying fucks
[5:49:11] Jango_: NA saves the day once again
[5:49:12] Dcarter: i just like the drama
[5:49:21] falldrgn: Liquid's strenght is their speed, and their ability re clear VERY quickly.. IE  CN
[5:49:22] akia03: @BoezIRL ya true but thats what like 200k max for mats and 100k fee for crafters
[5:49:26] Sollice: jesus christ...James Harden considering going back to the Rockets OR joining the Suns....Why anyone would sign him at this point blows my mind
[5:49:27] Rexialiton: @Dcarter Dcarter Pog <3
[5:49:33] shiftfazed: ii thinn most ppl dont care about that shit doesnt mean anything
[5:49:34] chinfu303: @Dcarter same
[5:49:36] its_hekks: @Towelliee the big advantage here is liquid had a strat and didnt stream it and give it to EU right away
[5:49:37] falldrgn: but if its a longer fight... echo  will win. longer fights favor them
[5:49:44] Dcarter: @Sollice its between harden or kyrie
[5:49:47] Lastprayer: Liquid is just good, period.
[5:49:50] BlinkHeals: max even said its like a 30-8 pull ratio
[5:49:52] Dcarter: both wanna join
[5:49:52] Sollice: For the suns?
[5:49:53] hammack52: all i have to say is shorter tiers are just going to kill the RWF streams faster cause people are going to go back to hiding their streams more
[5:49:54] herobreaker19: thats what im saying! better drama if it goes back and forth
[5:49:54] Dcarter: yes
[5:49:58] im_n0t_jezus: @Dcarter yup
[5:49:59] Dcarter: so they got a choice to make
[5:50:01] shiftfazed: good hope raids are super easy
[5:50:02] wlver1ne: Buenos Dias Cubano
[5:50:08] Sollice: If your the Suns take neither lol
[5:50:09] shiftfazed: dgaf
[5:50:14] Sollice: Does that mean Paul is gone then?
[5:50:14] mavericks312: @Sollice as a mavs fan they can take kyrie bum ass
[5:50:15] Effin_Steffin: THD’s Oreo Shake was the real MVP.
[5:50:16] Dcarter: lmao damn
[5:50:19] falldrgn: Kyrie can go the hell away. Great player.. Shit stain of a human being
[5:50:25] its_Xek: ya every guild just needs to do 100 splits and the bosses are 'undertuned' LUL
[5:50:26] buddhasheen: thats the way it should be
[5:50:34] Dcarter: Paul just always hurt he prolly stays but we know who the PG is ya know
[5:50:36] Gou99: whats your opinion on LIquid going dark for a bit to keep their strat during phase 3 quiet?'
[5:50:41] BoezIRL: @akia03 they are talking to 800k now and the prices will go up. most casual players will never get it even if they have the drop
[5:50:43] EnragedSushi: I'd take James Harden right now.  21 pts a game?  Sure
[5:50:44] Goodnevi1: I don't know the splits played a pretty integral part of winning the race, shouldn't be discounted as not part of the race
[5:50:47] Amarger: Global release and dedicated server for RWF guilds
[5:50:49] BlinkHeals: I think global release would only happen in blizz gets its hand on the RWF production
[5:50:53] mavericks312: also with harden its most likely a sign a trade right??
[5:50:55] akia03: oh towelliee did na token price shoot up aswel it went to almost 400k on eu
[5:50:59] Dcarter: @EnragedSushi what about 9pt game 7's?
[5:51:04] Parduke: viewing wise it was better since it wasn't just waiting for them to hit a difficulty brick wall and waiting for Blizz to nerf boss
[5:51:09] its_hekks: @Towelliee global release will NEVER work someone gets screwed always
[5:51:12] ZeusDNA: No servers are needed... They would just do global release live RWF lol
[5:51:18] tabondhimek: Who won the race?
[5:51:18] TheGiant99: But when the reset is only matters for the race other then that it's a none issue
[5:51:23] shimwood: Just do RWF on the PTR KEKW
[5:51:24] falldrgn: the ONLY time we would need a dedicated server is if Echo and Liquid are doing a charity event like a race or something
[5:51:25] Gitmm: rwf is so community driven also
[5:51:26] Klowned505: But the thing is blizzard doesn't have to do anything as this is all community driven anyway
[5:51:27] EnragedSushi: @Dcarter Embiid the MVP had 15 lol
[5:51:28] dimofodi: I'd like it to be when I sleep so I never miss time but that's now how life works. West coast has it best, which is why Liquid goes West coast to race. If they went East, they'd lost so much daytime.
[5:51:32] Armdel: just stop releasing raids
[5:51:33] TheCliffyShow: @tabondhimek Liquid
[5:51:33] Twyzted_f8: It goes global, there would be even more sponsors coming to play
[5:51:34] cazhually: Would be nice to see global release because it’s all individual team strategies and less coping
[5:51:36] Sollice: @its_hekks Who would get screwed by a global release?
[5:51:36] EnragedSushi: And blamed the entire team
[5:51:38] VeniVidiVici401TV: gloabal release would jsut increase the "maint downtime" for everyone right?
[5:51:50] cazhually: Echo had to come up with their own strat on sakarerhnand it wasn’t as good as liquids
[5:51:50] xViewersunitedx: whens the race to world first d4 max char race? towIgnit
[5:51:56] cazhually: That’s a huge reason why they lost
[5:51:56] shiftfazed: blizzard will bever have any association with rwf bs
[5:51:57] Dcarter: @EnragedSushi no youre right but Harden i dunno i just dont like him but your point is heard
[5:52:02] TheGiant99: Why change a bunch of shit for 3 guilds
[5:52:02] Moobot: towNut3 DROPS ARE DONE FAM! UNTIL THE SUBATHON! | ! Don't forget to DROP THAT PRIME SUB and support the DROPATHON - https://www.twitch.tv/subs/towelliee REMEMBER TO LINK YOUR BATTLE.NET AND TWITCH - https://account.battle.net/connections
[5:52:05] OssewTV: the issue with global release is there is no perfect time to release the raid due to time difference.
[5:52:05] pk99: what are those
[5:52:06] Amarger: Control the 100+split kills
[5:52:09] Oceansevan: I wonder if part of Blizz's hesitance to create a global release would be that they see it as "acknowledging" the RWF, that they thus far have stated they are not invested in
[5:52:09] Sayryn: I'm baffled that they haven't done a global release of a raid. They do it for the launch of the games all the time.
[5:52:09] Daarksyde: but then you are making EU or NA start at a later time, forcing them to "stay up late" instead of the other waking up morning and having all day to start
[5:52:14] cabalish: could be nike
[5:52:14] Djfarmville: blizzard is also an american company so possibility for some bias.
[5:52:15] Sollice: Suns should throw some money at one of the Laker guards
[5:52:21] Sollice: get some young hungry talent
[5:52:23] AlphasaurusRexx: @its_hekks the only way it screws over anyone is release timing and sleep schedules. its a fair playing field otherwise
[5:52:26] Dcarter: @Sollice no no no leave my lakers alone
[5:52:27] cinnamints: If Microsoft acquires ABK, I think Blizz will make everything international & simultaneous, Right now, I think reinvestment is so low, they don't want to push corporate to spend any of it on adjusting something that technically still works ok.
[5:52:30] its_hekks: @Sollice if it releases at 3pm PST like normal thats MIDNIGHT EU my man
[5:52:30] Sollice: @Djfarmville STOP IT
[5:52:31] EnragedSushi: @Dcarter Yeah I'm not a huge fan either.  My issue is he has the ability to do so much more but his attitude and drive is low
[5:52:38] Dcarter: this is the best rol players weve had in a while
[5:52:43] falldrgn: lol you will end up with Austin Reaves or Schroder lol
[5:52:47] Moobot: Ask a moderator for permission before posting a link, @faulen (warning)
[5:52:51] Sollice: @its_hekks So? Thats caled time lol. They will know ahead....adjust sleep schedule

[5:52:52] AlphasaurusRexx: @Sollice brah we just got KD. our budget is spent
[5:53:05] adxx: Why don't they do global release for this? Is there a specific reason why? Genuinely asking
[5:53:06] StickyTreez: those are airmax 720's
[5:53:11] Sollice: @Sollice I think Paul may be gone
[5:53:14] propwash80: YO CHAT are the servers up?
[5:53:14] Alsparq: release time changes each RWF to "benefit" the next region
[5:53:25] cazhually: You think slootbag will leave bdg considering they didn’t perform as wll
[5:53:29] BlinkHeals: @adxx blizz doesnt really care about RWF in the since of being a actual thing
[5:53:36] chinfu303: nope
[5:53:36] cazhually: Would love to see actually play on world first team
[5:53:44] KShellZx: nah
[5:53:45] Outerlaw: no
[5:53:50] xmedpakx: no classic , playing a bit of zelda in the meantime
[5:53:50] DecayedmiNt: And go...where?
[5:53:52] Dcarter: 4th is where bdg is?
[5:53:55] its_hekks: @Sollice adjusting sleep schedules is fine for 1 day my guy, have to do that for 2 weeks to stay afloat is rough, have you ever worked graveyard shift??? clearly you havent you dont have the same energy and you get TERRIBLE sleep
[5:53:56] Teknofear64: Classic has 4 hr maint listed
[5:54:00] apheelia96: lol I own 1 pair of sneakers I got 10 years ago!! But slippers! I got lots of those lol
[5:54:01] Dcarter: i dont see how they arent performing as normal
[5:54:03] adxx: @BlinkHeals do they global release expansions though? Or are they timezoned?
[5:54:03] Teknofear64: classic not up
[5:54:04] AlphasaurusRexx: @Sollice we gonna have to pull some ASU varsity players cause the suns budget is gone XD
[5:54:04] mavericks312: it would have to be a pretty big bag for sloot to leave
[5:54:04] CaptnPawPaws: Your eu character is prolly still falling through the earth
[5:54:11] falldrgn: well wherever Sloot goes.. Tegu goes..
[5:54:16] Ariea_Whisper: I think he said if they are top 5 he’d be happy
[5:54:22] akia03: chinese guild :)
[5:54:22] BlinkHeals: @adxx global release of expacs yes
[5:54:34] DecayedmiNt: Liquid only seeks out recruits anyway.
[5:54:36] mavericks312: i mean 3-5th is just right for BDG i dont see how they didnt perform well
[5:54:39] Sollice: @its_hekks Wait a second. These are professional players. They have weeks to prepare for this. That is not an excuse for them.
[5:54:39] adxx: hmm, thats just odd then
[5:54:43] darthhelmett: who are you talking about? @Towelliee
[5:54:44] EnragedSushi: I need the Echo Dinner Break discussed.
[5:54:45] Strrator: I think BDG did phenominally well considering they dont have the support systems the other guilds in the top do
[5:54:58] StickyTreez: @Towelliee  those are airmax 720's
[5:54:58] FrostyFlames: Drops!
[5:54:58] Moobot:  The website has gotten a...hellish..makeoever https://www.towelliee.com/ to keep updated on everything that's going on with the WoW:DF Marathons. Backgrounds, goals and giveaways, talents and UI we have it all!
[5:55:00] xhale2nhale: Mans just enjoying the game his way wth his team
[5:55:02] Dcarter: bdg is exactly where they should bve
[5:55:09] BlinkHeals: @adxx its because blizz doesnt recognize RWF as a thing there isnt even an achievment besides server first

[5:55:12] FrostyFlames: !drops
[5:55:13] Dcarter: they didnt underperform
[5:55:25] Djfarmville: @its_hekks During the race they do NOTHING else othen than raiding so having a degen sleep sched makes no differnece for 2 weeks
[5:55:25] Moobot: Tune in Jun 1st for our Second ever SUBATHON! It will be uncapped with tons of prizes and lots of goals! 4080/4090 RTX, CORSAIR, RAZER, GAMER ADVANTAGE and MORE!

[5:55:31] EnragedSushi: yuck
[5:55:38] mavericks312: how bout skyline having to find new servers and still a top 10 guild
[5:55:50] birdnorf: those are sick @Towelliee
[5:56:00] Dcarter: Where do they raid @mavericks312
[5:56:04] opalwinfrey: What is your favorite jordan retros?
[5:56:12] DecayedmiNt: @Dcarter TW servers now
[5:56:14] PvtHudson093: Telling me those arnt the Travis Scotts
[5:56:18] Dcarter: Ah ok
[5:56:19] mavericks312: @Dcarter taiwan servers i think
[5:56:20] ProPaineTheThird: ProPaineTheThird subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 5 months! 
[5:56:38] Dcarter: THE TRAVIS SCOTTS
[5:56:38] DecayedmiNt: @Dcarter Most china guild just went TW lol
[5:56:43] Armdel: travis scott burger?!
[5:56:46] liviu_81: POGGERS
[5:56:51] BlinkHeals: No one would care th o
[5:57:06] Keyastaron_: LUL
[5:57:06] Reckless_Monk: @towelliee look at Jet_Limits reply to Gingi on twitter shits about to pop off
[5:57:09] shiftfazed: nope
[5:57:11] xxsargexx: people would notice though
[5:57:12] soysos91: Would a RWF Tournament realm fix all the drama haha?
[5:57:16] PvtHudson093: Just a joke about that time your friends just randomly asking if those were Travis Scotts
[5:57:30] its_hekks: @Djfarmville you couldnt be more wrong.... sleep is literally the most essential thing to long taxing raid hours
[5:57:31] BlinkHeals: @Soysos19 no it would take people out of the actual game
[5:57:33] Lastprayer: Hahaha “who”
[5:57:35] EnragedSushi: CERTAIN people notice the difference.
[5:57:36] slide_on_clay: how big is your collection?
[5:57:41] Reckless_Monk: CoGM of Liquid
[5:57:42] Lastprayer: Poor Jet lol
[5:57:47] opalwinfrey: Y'all underestimate the amount of people who collect sneakers and pay attention to that stuff.
[5:57:54] alwayspresto: Jet used to run Limit
[5:57:56] shiftfazed: never heard of her
[5:57:57] alwayspresto: IIRC
[5:57:58] hammack52: im not into shoes so i dont think i would know the difference
[5:57:59] Twyzted_f8: Jet is meh
[5:58:13] EnragedSushi: Sneakerheads notice

[5:58:55] DunzoCD: @BlinkHeals not true i literally said i like the dudes jordans when they were chillin on the couch LUL
[5:59:07] opalwinfrey: @BlinkHeals That is false, because I am always looking at shoes lol
[5:59:10] Reckless_Monk: KEKW
[5:59:18] Holysal: this drama is great
[5:59:21] EnragedSushi: @BlinkHeals weird
[5:59:28] Lastprayer: Lol Fraud Watch
[5:59:33] smashwow: wtf happpened now
[5:59:34] Hebrewish012: why is there drama ? O.o
[5:59:36] NMosier85: Open vault yet @towelliee ?
[5:59:39] kevnil: always this fcking drama
[5:59:40] BlinkHeals: yall lie to much
[5:59:44] Broomba: next thing you know, Yo momma jokes are going to be used KEKW
[5:59:47] ZeusDNA: Man, I feel bad for Raidbots site when the servers come up later KEKW
[6:00:01] EnragedSushi: Echo called a lunch break while Liquid was sub 2% lol.    It's on them
[6:00:01] Moobot:  Help Towelliee reach the 1,000,000 followers goal. Click that heart button and join the Hammer Squad community!
[6:00:06] wraaith: how many ours offline did they raid tho
[6:00:06] xxsargexx: @Hebrewish012 the usual drama of no global release, NA head starts, tuning, etc etc
[6:00:36] kevnil: @EnragedSushi what??
[6:00:42] smashwow: @EnragedSushi i mean kinda. but at the same time echo was still 6 hours out from killing it.
[6:00:46] BlinkHeals: I think 2 guilds killing it before method gave method all they needed to spend less time
[6:00:51] Hebrewish012: @xxsargexx ah that's just nonsense, last patch NA complained EU got ahead this patch NA got ahead...
[6:00:57] tdpark_: yep
[6:01:03] Reckless_Monk: pretty m uch
[6:01:03] pbnj_kills: i liked that take
[6:01:05] Djfarmville: pretty much
[6:01:10] EnragedSushi: @EnragedSushi I get that.  But as a "champion" you don't call a lunch break when your rival is sub 2% on the last boss.
[6:01:11] angahax: dont have a take that give gingi brain rot
[6:01:12] mavericks312: doc rivers just got fired
[6:01:30] dimofodi: Echo beat Method but Method was more efficient is what they're saying I think.
[6:01:32] sl1nky1981: Liquid didn't play well when they woke up yesterday or they likely would have killed it much sooner

[6:01:40] Crunchroll0630: I feel like if anything, they are saying that Method could become a contender again.
[6:01:42] xxsargexx: @Hebrewish012 it happens everytime LUL im fairly certain EU has the most WF's throughout WoW's lifespan and Echo won the last 3 in a row but god forbid they lose
[6:01:44] BTiZZY_: @hebrewish012 no the only thing they complained about was the way they nerfed raz while they were sleeping
[6:01:46] Holysal: @mavericks312 seen that coming. that man cant win a game 7
[6:01:57] BlinkHeals: crazy all these teams that make it to the playoffs fire their coach but the teams that dont even make it keep them for ever
[6:01:58] Sollice: @BTiZZY_ This is correct.
[6:01:58] Moobot:  Check out Towelliee's YouTube channel! You can view the most recent uploaded video HERE || Custom Figurine in World of Warcraft youtu.be/SS6LcFmgXJk
[6:02:02] xhale2nhale: ya know its always drama or some deep conversations when Limit/Liquid wins n Echo loses
[6:02:22] Sollice: Listen...I know how the Suns can avoid James Harden. Hire Doc Rivers as the coach
[6:02:27] plaggues: Method is a contender again, proved that today
[6:02:47] oRiie: Doc Rivers not a bad coach but that man is cursed; you get to a game 6 or 7 in the playoffs and you are just doomed; it's the way of the universe at this point
[6:02:54] BlinkHeals: @plaggues agreed especially how quickly they got back after all that went down
[6:03:00] EnragedSushi: I think a 3 of Harden , Durant and Booker would work well.
[6:03:02] BTiZZY_: @sollice i’m just praying we don’t bring him back lol (houston)
[6:03:07] Hebrewish012: I have no problem with either side winning, it is what happens when you have teams located in different time zones and release times.

[6:03:12] xxsargexx: its a lose/lose for NA though, if NA wins then people complain and cause drama, if NA loses then its the whole "Lol NA sucks cant even win with advantages"
[6:03:13] kevnil: jeeses these echo vs liquid in chat xD
[6:03:15] EnragedSushi: Sometimes a change of scenery can help
[6:03:16] Djfarmville: time for EU to merge echo and method to run it back next tier KEKW
[6:03:29] Sollice: You know the thing though with that game 7 was Joel and James played like SHIT. Yes the coach is part of that buy they were bbbbbaaaaadddd
[6:03:31] Broomba: EU time @towelliee
[6:03:38] Hebrewish012: Liquid pulled a smart move where they progressed a bunch off cameras
[6:03:39] kevnil: whats so hard to understand that liquid just out played echo this tier
[6:03:43] Twyzted_f8: Echo played through exhaustion
[6:03:45] plaggues: Isn't echo comprised of half old method players?
[6:03:53] Hebrewish012: and they didnt share the strat basically coming way far ahead of echo
[6:04:01] EnragedSushi: @Sollice Just gonna see Embiid cry over something again midcourt
[6:04:05] EthicalHermit: They did that to "show" the release time matters
[6:04:17] Febreze1212: towHesaidit
[6:04:22] smashwow: and time on boss
[6:04:22] dreamwalker213: I think it’s pretty cool that the past 6 races has ended up 3-3 for each
[6:04:25] plaggues: Did Method use a diff strat for last boss?
[6:04:29] ZeusDNA: Liquid was on point
[6:04:29] Moobot: Tune in Jun 1st for our Second ever SUBATHON! It will be uncapped with tons of prizes and lots of goals! 4080/4090 RTX, CORSAIR, RAZER, GAMER ADVANTAGE and MORE!

[6:04:33] im_n0t_jezus: Yeppers
[6:04:35] xmirrxrs: True
[6:04:35] xxsargexx: no doubt Liquid played out of their minds this tier

[6:04:47] mavericks312: echo lost that race the minute liquid logged on at 6am stop it
[6:04:49] EnragedSushi: Aren't the server down till 11 am PDT?
[6:04:50] Sollice: I hate the NA vs EU release shit. ITS ALWAYS BEEN THIS WAY THIS IS NOT A DEBATE. Why do people continue to bring this up.
[6:04:51] Demanisraar: Echo will be back though, and this is only good for competition
[6:04:51] Alsparq: first tier Echo was clearly better. this tier liquid was far superior
[6:04:53] Broomba: time difference cause Liquid won is a lame ass excuse, echo was lost
[6:04:55] ravennl: It's not a race when you don't start all at once. You could call it a race when checking attempts imo
[6:04:59] adxx: nobody care'
[6:05:05] pbnj_kills: if we are talking about the first bosses then all the first 4/9 guild would be talked about
[6:05:06] zeiours: The maintenance time difference question will always be there every race until they start at the same time.
[6:05:09] xmedpakx: ya echo missed taking strats lol
[6:05:14] Dcarter: We still on this time thing
[6:05:15] Dcarter: Lmao

[6:05:22] TheCliffyShow: The first 8 bosses are opens. The last is the main event.
[6:05:23] mavericks312: liquid big dicked echo with that 14% at 6am
[6:05:24] tdpark_: true, gotta respect that 5 am wake up
[6:05:24] Dcarter: People just never learn
[6:05:27] xhale2nhale: Echo should've just did what Max did in Shadowlands, dude called the race for his team mentality, Echo team was feeling destroyed
[6:05:30] Crunchroll0630: agreed
[6:05:33] Fortvila: Yeah but in theory they got to last boss in 1 day less, meaning there is room to argue that they should have had 1 more day to progress on last boss.
[6:05:33] DunzoCD: that slapped that 14% dick on the table
[6:05:35] Hebrewish012: yeah liquid pull a bde move just log in with little to no sleep
[6:05:36] Broomba: echo mentally lost it

[6:06:56] polotakos: EU servers are just Backup US servers haha
[6:06:57] xxsargexx: @Armdel max said they had a strat for phase 3 and didnt want echo to snatch it because if they did then echo would've killed it no doubt
[6:07:04] Yagr6: TBH. Echo lucky raz got nerfed while liquid was asleep, who knows how that would have went!
[6:07:05] im_n0t_jezus: unorthodox
[6:07:08] smashwow: liquid was hungry for the win

[6:13:55] odriscoll1234: echo fall aprt what a fool lol
[6:13:57] keeindordel: Max sets the bar on what a good team and guild should be like
[6:13:57] Broomba: the world is ending cause a certain guild didnt win RWF!! KEKW there are more tragedies in life
[6:14:03] Fortvila: I mean even if they dont do the global release, they could still do a global openeing of Mythic. The first few days used for HC splits anyway
[6:14:13] GodKingMuninn: meanwhile the method bois have the best RWF etiqtute.

[6:15:11] xhale2nhale: ppl still on this whole Global release
[6:15:20] Mistersalted: servers up?
[6:15:20] Kifimbo: The hard part for Liquid is that people really wanted to see/hear what Max was saying while leading...so the main "color commentary" channel was always behind

[6:18:32] keeindordel: Imagine hoe the ref would be if they didnt
[6:18:47] CrunkyBrewster: and realistically they shouldnt have to
[6:18:49] EclipserEU: @keeindordel but it was all avoidable dmg tho
[6:18:50] PYRO_MANI8C: i joined one of the liquid splits this tier on my alt it was easy gold lol
[6:18:59] Collected1: the only solution is a mythic realm with NPCs that hand out gear which also allows for a global launch.
[6:19:01] CrunkyBrewster: RWF was never a Blizzard official thing
[6:19:03] Pallyofhell: should have kept personal loot and let mythic just be group loot
[6:19:07] Hebrewish012: it's funny in Shadowlands they paid 1 mill gold per weapon now they paid only 150k per participating in a run ?
[6:19:07] NVbrutal: is it really exploiting tho when they are getting payed lol viewers were getting payed 250k per heroic run they did.
[6:19:13] 91Niki: Nerfing the raids AFTER world first race ends takes time and effort from Blizzard, and they shouldn't spend time on it for the 0.1%
[6:19:21] backerxx: I think the RWF is a better event if it's completed in 1 reset

[6:19:37] CrunkyBrewster: yeah it is
[6:19:39] CrunkyBrewster: LUL
[6:19:45] WundertueteGER: separate difficulty would be perfect, everyone has the same gear / item lvl, no farming.
[6:19:46] CrunkyBrewster: thats how it comes off to me
[6:19:47] NVbrutal: ill take that bribe anyday lol
[6:19:47] Kifimbo: They still get their subscription money, regardless how fast they kill it
[6:19:50] smesh88: because it is a bribe lol
[6:19:56] sko0bie: i wouldve went and need rolled just so theyd kick me xD
[6:19:57] tommysavagex: @Towelliee  I think the raid being easier is good but I do think they should do a global launch ( I don't think that mattered so much this race tho)
[6:20:03] smesh88: lets call an apple an apple today
[6:20:03] Hebrewish012: LOL
[6:20:08] reggiepowa: echo wasnt paying that much this time, they didnt give any guaranteed gold only chance to enter giveaways
