Not to mention also I've got the balance improved thorns speced increase damage by 75%. That shit will fucking pump. Good luck out-dpsing my buff. It's a godsend.

[4:51:36] Winttyrr: the people WITH the addon will be so outnumbered they cant do dungeons or quests. everyone else will be grouped for mob tagging and elite quests
[4:51:36] Badacems: @sodapoppin why use the addon if the official server has perma lockout on dungeons and no trade built in already

[4:51:39] Ninekoo: AND??
[4:51:39] ReadiNRainboW: Wait so what’s the addon
[4:51:40] baggospiders: elitist hc
[4:51:41] Aldra_E: The people who make the addon worked with blizzard to make the official hc servers, i think they will let the addon die
[4:51:41] ascended7: Damn guilty till proven innocent
[4:51:42] holyskele: in hc server when u die you cant come back what is the point of addon
[4:51:42] qubilly: if they do ssf hardcore like poe i'm fine

[4:51:46] AaronInternet: stockades time?
[4:51:47] Cropzo: @ShawBMC blocks trades and keeps track of dungeon IDs
[4:51:48] Go4theKnees: does the addon log that stuff or?
[4:51:50] Svetdwell: ur right, he's a hater of those who buy gold
[4:51:50] InsulinDependent: @KazakiTV i was in one of the best hardcore speedrunning guilds in teh world so yea i did. They deleted specific addons for good reason there is no valid reason here. This isnt the spit emote bro

[4:51:57] tommyp915: dxd WoW
[4:51:58] Lucons1: why not just make a server with the addon built in or something i dont get it
[4:51:58] JUICEMASTERCHAMPION: actually dumbest take ive ever heard and thats saying a lot

[4:53:21] Fossabot: @Sothraa, They are using the Hardcore addon from Curseforge. Rules here: classichc.net/rules
[4:53:22] GR3MN: Wow support has been shit for a long time now after they kicked all the gms
[4:53:23] biiosphere: !addons

[4:53:27] iduckbro: IGNORED no thanks SHARKING
[4:53:27] Franky5Fingers: I play without the addon now. HC is about the challenge for me. I don't care what anyone else thinks and I don't do dungeons
[4:53:27] Salssa: blizzard doing anythin in 2023
[4:53:27] JUICEMASTERCHAMPION: the only reason to use the addon is because there wasnt officially supported hardcore, since there will be addon is completely pointless
[4:53:30] laulool: @Jstocks They're not willing to pay people to look into these appeals in a timely manner
[4:53:30] Kujiia: if a griefer level to 60 without die I'll let them grief me tbh
[4:53:31] kahrazy: blizz will stop paying attention to griefs about 1 month after servers launch
[4:53:31] Rilix: why not disable the addon, login, trade stuff, then turn the addon back on
[4:53:32] simplygaarryy: ur actually based tbh

[4:53:47] Svetdwell: tru
[4:53:48] Ryboh: tru
[4:53:48] nobanarino: yeah and you can maybe take out a 60 who loses a ton of time
[4:53:48] habokini: No it wont
[4:53:48] jtchillin: no appeal will be weird and dungeon cap should only be max 3 times if they change it
[4:53:49] predzz_: @habokini if people greif without HC, why wouldnt they, pretty obvious, thats like assuming no one cheats
[4:53:49] ShepardTwitch: curious to see how many would use the addon vs not
[4:53:49] wannaodin: its not the same environment
[4:53:49] Tahu_: what if they code the addon into the game itself?
[4:53:51] CryHavocTTV: Calamity already said HC Elite isn't using the addon. @sodapoppin

[4:53:56] tjbookerftw2: im glad we dont have to abide by the solo self found
[4:53:57] Tommyzan: They'd have to put really strict leashing on mobs
[4:53:58] maximumdrip: Blizzard needs to prevent big elites from leaving certain areas so they can’t be kited
[4:53:58] illoomenated: i think the rules with this addon make the game more fun
[4:53:59] AjunaDarkspear: me either, its fun. just use the addon
[4:53:59] Winttyrr: people do hate the addon?! the ironman rules suck ass
[4:54:00] fiskensfriend: @sodapoppin why dont the addon users stay on bloodsail and th rest of us play with out it on the new server?
[4:54:00] tropicalshark: i blame blozzard
[4:54:01] findobin: not being able to groupup whenever you want is gonna be boring as fuck
[4:54:01] Nahsta: just wait and see what it is and the addon will fill gaps
[4:54:02] Waytoowhat: they even invited the add-on devs over to talk about THAT
[4:54:02] Aldra_E: Whats the point of an official server if theres still gonna be the addon?
[4:54:02] IAmTheJeff: I mean with blizzards reporting system, if one person gets griefed and records people in discord can just mass report and get them banned right away
[4:54:04] french_gab: but grief will prob force people to go on RP server
[4:54:07] koco92: I went to 60 with no add-ons, no dungeons at all, and no blues or higher. I gained nothing, what a waste of time
[4:54:07] vidulan: you're assuming the majority like the addon. its just tolerated. wont be a thing on official

[4:54:39] RussianArmedBear: @scribbleton_ he's played this game 10x longer than you btw
[4:54:39] Goomiie_: It allows different rule sets to emerge without huge server updates.

[4:55:47] Rennat611: the chronoboon was a good alternative as well
[4:55:48] Jindo_ZG: @sodapoppin I think Ony  should be the only buff, get rid of flower and diremaul
[4:55:54] iduckbro: xpp
[4:55:54] Bloodhawk360: No 😡 im classic andy 😡 i want to clear a raid with zero thought 😡 i have one brain cell 😡
