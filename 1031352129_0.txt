[1:44:40] SonofHorus82: It's easily the most common mount that I've seen.
[1:45:20] NovaSun84: Getting Crit to consistently get you XP is probably better IMO

[1:45:41] CritcobainTV: mara is beter xp /hr
[1:45:51] BlueBeast33: How big is the xp nerf for 20-60? I just hit 20 on my blood elf
[1:45:52] NovaSun84: Maybe just like 2-3 runs so you don't get dungeon capped.

[1:47:28] Skylin3r: 20 iron bombs 20 solid dynamite 5 explosive sheep

[2:14:45] itscityboy: gachiHYPER
[2:14:48] toobaked1987: Thats what she said?
[2:14:49] verZUNGE: hockey puck
[2:14:53] SweatyT3d: damn
[2:14:58] bullymikko: Naga was perfect for my manlet hands
[2:15:03] pooranoia: razer Abysus just bought it
[2:15:03] Noobpownin09: its a cheeze wheel
[2:15:04] ThaOriginalGamester: cupahGasm grab it
[2:15:06] pooranoia: it was cheap AF
[2:15:08] SonofHorus82: "it's not big in length, it's big in girth" Someone clip that, but JUST that.
[2:15:13] PrimalTroxa: ya the Naga feels small after using the G600 for awhile
[2:15:21] Spicy_Curryy: I love my logitech G502, perfect for all my needs
[2:15:30] NovaSun84: I'm waiting until your HyperX cycle.  :)  That's been my main keyboard/mouse last 2 years
[2:15:34] Nico_vdM: I must say this boost is going very speedily
[2:15:36] AndrewShifuVA: my cat ate the cable from my razzer naga
[2:15:44] Wh1rly: iv ehad good luck with eveything razer
[2:15:46] overshot14: Did you say you used the Corsair scimitar?
[2:15:51] Kinghorn: tell penny I said hi
[2:15:53] Bronthus: had the green razer naga (2013?) for 7 years. solid and so good
[2:15:54] KurtMoe: I've had the same razor naga mouse for 8 years now
[2:15:55] Nico_vdM: He said he broke 3 scimitars
[2:15:57] Sonatta: i had a death adder's mouse wheel break on me, very annoying
[2:15:58] Znza: duuuude i have my 2016 razer black widow still, just dirty from dust collection in the draweer, works perfectly still
[2:15:58] Dkgungo: the original blackwindow was indestructible
[2:16:01] bgriff87: I ruined mine by spilling beer all over once :(
[2:16:02] alkazam_gg: I bought Steelseries Rival 500 for MMOs and that was a huge disappointment
[2:16:03] pooranoia: pooranoia is gifting 1 Tier 1 Subs to Towelliee's community! 
[2:16:04] pooranoia: pooranoia gifted a Tier 1 sub to Haengelmann! 
[2:16:08] pooranoia: smoke break
[2:16:13] caelhunter: I have small hands and I've had a problem finding a good gaming mouse
[2:16:16] KillaFin: IGN KEKWDISCO
[2:16:18] kokochris: love this song
[2:16:24] Sonatta: it's actually a crazy report
[2:16:33] NovaSun84: I only trust inside sources from Jason Schrier Kappa
[2:16:37] CodeJPG: Yeah he should be
[2:16:47] Kamon21: Wonder if I should get back on WoW I think in had a paladin at 57
[2:17:07] Chiraakitteh: I fixed my razor mouse with a few layers of packing tape cut into a small rectangle. The left and right click issues are because the little nubs that make contact with the switch  wear down. It’s easy to take off the bottom feet glider sticker, then open the mouse and install a few layers of tape over the switch so button presses reach the switch consistently again. Beats spending 100 on a new mouse.
[2:17:14] Blazzerx: HAMMERS UP POGGERS

[2:19:16] Znza: i wish d3 got a graphical update, phonegame has better graphics now
[2:19:37] kokochris: poor guy, he was actually upset.  I understand that, they put alot of work and wanted to show case it to the people.  even if it didn't hit the mark, you gotta respect the effort.
[2:19:39] propwash80: @Towelliee if blizz was to continue w/ the classic thing what xpac do you think they should stop at? for me wrath should be their last
[2:20:09] clambynature: @Towelliee and Chat! What is the BC sever that every one of us is playing on

[2:20:44] tygol_: can anyone link the article?
[2:20:45] 210Crawler: who that? lol
[2:20:46] Domi98_: wasn't jeff there before ion?
[2:20:47] kokochris: praise the Ion
[2:20:55] Sarocus: No one carries a Blizzcon boner like Ion!
[2:20:56] MetallicusGaming: genjirc it's on wowhead
[2:20:56] NovaSun84: IonJam still alive
[2:21:05] MetallicusGaming: Ion is a dreadlord
[2:21:09] MetallicusGaming: I mean Jaina Kappa
[2:21:36] kokochris: this is a fairly normal process.  not unique to blizzard

[2:22:03] Moobot: Check out Towelliee's latest Youtube video! https://youtu.be/U8-64zqVa8k Shadowlands needs some help
[2:22:23] Thoreya: so the wow devs are just out of touch
[2:22:25] Thoreya: it seems
[2:22:25] Domi98_: Kappa
[2:22:26] torridcheese3: So it's just Blizzard making terrible decisions not Activision. Good to know Kappa
[2:22:43] kokochris: at the highest levels that's not true.
[2:22:54] bgriff87: They making so much money from Warzones they just let them do their thing Kappa
[2:23:08] Atruis_: Wait so we cant blame Activision anymore?! Kappa
[2:23:09] Enraig: Of course they don't interfere with creative decisions. Monetization is not a creative decision
[2:23:09] Znza: lol investors make the decision activision is the messenger and blizzard is the worker
[2:23:12] Kitsune_Kaze: Activision is the Jailer and we're all trapped in the Shadowlands
[2:23:16] kokochris: budget, timelines and product offerings will be discussed at the highest levels first
[2:23:17] Molvonos: Multi-dollar company yo.
[2:24:04] Elwhappo: CoolCat
[2:24:25] kokochris: @znza actually it goes from product first, up towards the board later, tweaks and sent back down to product.  then engineering begins
[2:25:09] Znza: my lifes been a lie then @kokochris xD good to know. its crazy some of the decisions being made if that is the case
[2:25:31] Lesrek: normal outside of games, not normal in the games industry
[2:25:48] WestCoastGrow: @Lesrek, not true
[2:25:49] kokochris: @znza I can tell you, it's tough process. but it's not all one sided.  so don't worry
[2:26:00] WestCoastGrow: Its now pretty normal in the games industry
[2:26:02] Thoreya: ion talks pog
[2:26:04] Chiraakitteh: Plenty of people work in jobs that never gives bonuses.
[2:26:14] WestCoastGrow: Indie studios are different
[2:26:24] WestCoastGrow: Large, corp studios, its the normal
[2:26:43] TheItalianStallion321: yeah...real fuckin exciting...
[2:26:49] kokochris: corp bonuses depend on the company.  they may halt bonuses overall due to profits.  however individual bonuses can still happen.  it's based on a percentage of the overall business unit and your performance.
[2:27:00] Collected1: ooooh
[2:27:02] sphynx_rayne: OW2 LUL OWLJunkrat
[2:27:04] Thoreya: so now wow 2

[2:27:37] Atruis_: Wow transmog mobile game
[2:27:42] SonofHorus82: I would probably play a WoW game that is like Star Wars Galaxy of Heroes or Marvel Strike Force.
[2:27:45] Znza: wow 2 will probably be whatever mike's working on
[2:27:46] GonoFPS: they should have a wow mobile game that we can do fishing and professioons for years now
[2:27:56] geokouts: Wow mobile and on Blizzard you hear the cashing machine sound
[2:27:56] propwash80: @Towelliee do you think that blizz is working on a new ip mmo?
[2:27:59] Opallea: If they had a WoW game like Raid I would play
[2:28:00] kokochris: don't need wow2.  just keep updating wow as it is.  I would love to see older zones revamped
[2:28:03] Sarocus: Blizzcoins will be the new world currency
[2:28:04] stallowned: starcraft or overwatch mmo POGGERS

[2:29:09] wafflerboss: f
[2:29:45] Thoreya: yup

[2:29:46] Thoreya: lol
[2:29:48] Thoreya: pretty much

[3:31:46] mitchumtx: What the hell would WOW2 actually be LORE WISE.
[3:31:51] haloinfintes: Noone is even close to WoW's raid design and level of polish in general. Takes years and years

[3:32:53] BubbaChubbs420: the free to play model is horrible for star wars
[3:32:56] Lesrek: going from WoW into star wars was like going from a lamborgini to a pinto
[3:32:58] Ravageful: what was wrong with the engine?
[3:33:00] Talk_Nerdy_2Me: the old Ilum PVP slide shows
[3:33:03] mitchumtx: feel like WOW2 would be a budget around 300-500 Million....

[3:33:10] miriones: elder scrolls have nice lore but the gameplay sucks

[3:35:30] JonnyScotland: I don't like final fantasy 14 graphics or characters
[3:35:37] miriones: ff14 is terrible the worst mmo i ever played
[3:35:37] Bubisaur: online gaming just has changed, MMO is the only game that does good in this genre
[3:35:40] Atruis_: FFXIV is too grainy for me
[3:35:40] mitchumtx: People need to stop wanting shit to be sooo perfect! NOT EVERYTHING will be "PERFECT"!
[3:35:44] xana211: ff art style just doesnt do it for me
[3:35:44] LordOfTheMallards: I went to bdo

[3:35:52] Enraig: I won't play final fantasy 14 because it's final fantasy /:
[3:35:54] gg_bois11: not to mention the gameplay in ff14 is not great
[3:35:55] Thoreya: FF graphics are so not appealing either lol
[3:35:55] CCG_337: lol, what are you talking?
[3:35:56] oradros: 11 years
[3:35:57] dracullus: people that just level in new mmo and call it best shit ever are so funny
[3:35:58] adrian_fell: what about SWTOR?
[3:35:58] Thoreya: imo
[3:36:01] Bubisaur: ff14 is just too different from wow
[3:36:01] IianaDRK: i love ff14 but it doesnt have any endgame content outside of the raid
[3:36:05] FluffehZ: There is a lot to do than Wow for sure, i've been playing this for 4 years.... i know
[3:36:17] Sonatta: it's why everyone MMO that launches will have to deal with "there's no end game" crowd even when it has an end game, it's just not enough
[3:36:17] mitchumtx: FFXIV just doesnt have alot of content like WOW does.
[3:36:18] Znza: it wants to thrive just needs a breathe of fresh air
[3:36:19] ArcaneSyntax: 9.0 has more content than FFXIV has in it's entire game.
[3:36:21] JonnyScotland: I think wow graphics are better than final fantasy. Is it just me?
[3:36:26] CritcobainTV: @FluffySwede those are rookie numbers
[3:36:28] xana211: Runescape Kappa

[3:36:36] mitchumtx: i play FFXIV, i came back to WOW because i ran out of FFXIV content
[3:36:36] George2001k: @towelliee do you think we will ever see in the future Legion like we did Classic and bo TBC?
[3:36:37] Bubisaur: oh wait that was 1999
[3:36:41] Atruis_: @JonnyScotland I like WoW's graphics better
[3:36:44] Meowrawrmoo: I'm hoping Pantheon fills the mmo spot I'm looking for
[3:36:54] Haengelmann: I mean. WoW, ESO, FFXIV, BDO and others have really good player numbers right now and are targeting vastly different player bases
[3:36:57] 0doz: Again... Bring Back WILDSTAR
[3:37:11] MrSnekyDino: I thought there was an AoE cap on Blizzard. Does it only cap damage and not slows?
[3:37:21] Alepouditsa: @mitchum69 and i was thinking of trying it thank you you save me money
[3:37:22] Shrenko: I thought mage boosting was nerfed in BC ?
[3:37:23] FluffehZ: @critcobain Well did stop playing Wow for 14, i haven't enjoyed an mmo more before
[3:37:24] Haengelmann: aoe cap is on retail
[3:37:25] CritcobainTV: @Towelliee Imagine how much gold i could make if i didn't do every single boost for free KEKW
[3:37:26] Seitz501: Whats classic Gold Cap?
[3:37:29] KaLYes: BTW WoW is still the best MMO sadly. No other game comes close to it. FF14 is some weeb shit and BDO is P2W. Dont see any other good mmo
[3:37:37] KillaFin: KEKWDISCO Wildstar KEKWDISCO 8 hours of leveling KEKWDISCO only raiding content KEKWDISCO
[3:37:38] BrewCityMonk: FF14 have tons of endgame content then WoW.
[3:37:41] Bubisaur: it doe slook like the aoe cap is already enabled?
[3:37:53] Alacod: @Kassc35 Is that game even going to release it's system also seems dated.
[3:37:58] miriones: amazon have so much money and yet the mmo they making is bad
[3:38:07] gg_bois11: bro ashes looks like a eso clone i dont see it being a "wow killer"

[3:38:57] Warjun11: garnison was still the best side system
[3:38:58] FluffehZ: For those people saying that XIV don't have more content than Wow, i would disagree. Wow dose have more expansions but they are barely touched compare to XIV where all content are viable
[3:39:00] chadleyhank: Ez clap
[3:39:00] Tremonti95: There'll never be a wow killer. But maybe a wow alternative that wont cost that much
[3:39:06] biirrd: I think the new starwars mmo that Massive (behind Division1-2) can make some dent in the mmo world. The snowdrop engien is good
[3:39:11] callmestray: is pvp honor grind best way to gear up quickly at 60 right now?
[3:39:12] Meowrawrmoo: @alacod I don't know
[3:39:15] KaLYes: Tencent is kinda getting in everything and that is scary. They are not giants they are colossals I am kinda scared for every gaming company because eventually Tencet will buy them and everything will become  Asian shit games
[3:39:26] Orthobullet: maybe becauase its been so long ago
[3:39:27] Somakutala: Ghost crawler isn't a dev, he is a game designer
[3:39:36] CodyKane: thats why they dont mention him
[3:39:47] neverbornlucky: towelliee has peons to bring him gear
[3:39:47] Moobot: towHAMUP Follow Towelliee on twitter so you can be in the know at all times! | twitter.com/towelthetank towKawaii
[3:39:51] adrian_fell: isnt game designer sort of a dev tho?
[3:40:07] Ravageful: dev is usually reserved towards the programmers i believe
[3:40:15] KillaFin: mmos are dead in the way most people used to see it. WoW was the pinnicle but it also opened pandoras box of "convenience" that eventually lead to things like store mounts lets be real.
[3:40:15] Lazugo: @Somakutala Which is a dev too
[3:40:29] SpoofAvatar: they are scared of Ghostcrawler
[3:40:32] Blistz1: Ghostcrawler made frost mages the best spec
[3:40:38] Rottencoarse: was really sad about Kaplan and the Art guy for WoW @Towelliee
[3:41:07] Lesrek: GC is great but it also means paladins will blow "into the ground" :D
[3:41:12] StoicTaurus: GS spend years building world and Lore of LoL
[3:41:14] miriones: in RIOT we trust for a good mmorpg
[3:41:15] Collected1: KillaFin : they shifted with the demographic. classic is great nostalgia but a tiny percentage have the time or patience to level up to 60 the traditional way
[3:41:15] adrian_fell: ye i dont know if you could get someone more experienced with mmmos LULW
[3:41:17] TheEnstraynomic: ghostcrawler has been killing it with games even going back to age of empires 2 LUL
[3:41:19] gidgeet: wasn't it his idea to come up with the MMO for Riot?
[3:41:20] purekappa123: @towelliee what level did you start doing Mara runs? And how much are they
[3:41:22] TheGaoSora: those LoL lore even have intersting races besides humans and fox girls?
[3:41:29] Alepouditsa: @mitchum69 what make me thinking it a lot of there shop i hear the have to much cosmetics on it insted in game
[3:41:35] adrian_fell: was ghostcrawler with blizz since day 1?
[3:41:51] ElPolloBatman: i've not much faith in mmos. you can't make a game that caters to those who only want to play that game for hours and those who want to have a nice and casual experience, but also do something else than basically work an unpaid job playing a mmo
[3:41:52] Lazugo: @TheOmniSora Hell yes the league lore (runeterra) is huge man
[3:42:00] TWINTVT: !addons

[3:42:06] Collected1: i cant see a league based MMO grabbing me
[3:42:13] TheGaoSora: @TheOmniSora good to know :)
[3:42:20] pupsgnomette: another weeb mmo .. no thanks
[3:42:22] Collected1: i feel like you need to already be invested in the league world and it's lore to get value from an MMO based on it
[3:42:29] mitchumtx: There is a TON of cosmetics in the world of FFXIV. Cosmetics in the store are not that great AT ALL! @Alepouditsa
[3:42:34] SpoofAvatar: F
[3:42:43] wafflerboss: i dont give a single crap about the lore i just want endgame with league level polish
[3:42:51] TheGaoSora: As long as they wont fall to the "esport" trap like wow did, they'll do ok
[3:43:02] FluffehZ: People are to quick to judge XIV without playing enough of the game rooREE
[3:43:02] Lazugo: @TheOmniSora https://map.leagueoflegends.com/ Heres a inside of leagues lore
[3:43:05] jeziorek: WHO said its gonna be lol MMO ? its gonna be root MMO . maybe new lore?
[3:43:06] The_Hollow_Man: @Collected1 that depends on the story telling in the mmo, and Leagues Lore is just phenomenal
[3:43:08] Collected1: i still think the world needs a Harry Potter MMO
[3:43:14] Collected1: its set up perfectly
[3:43:20] wafflerboss: wut
[3:43:26] adrian_fell: it would be dumb of riot not to make an MMO set in the league universe imho
[3:43:28] Alepouditsa: @mitchum69 ohh!
[3:43:33] Dkgungo: @Collected1 as a potter head i agree
[3:43:33] Moobot: Check out Towelliee's latest Youtube video! https://youtu.be/U8-64zqVa8k Shadowlands needs some help
[3:43:36] BrewCityMonk: I still play WoW time to time but just for art reason only
[3:43:51] MuttonChopins: yeah man a Harry Potter MMO would be great, but set after the movies not during @Collected1
[3:43:57] KillaFin: honestly, only way mmos are going to make a comback > "full dive baby" GandalfPls 200IQ WeSmart
[3:44:00] justdavesadly: The league universe will have so many stories for them to tell there is so much lore.
[3:44:01] Collected1: Dkgungo : it has everything an MMO needs. two sides. lore. classes. great boss encounters. a huge world.
[3:44:02] Blistz1: Guys what if Ion moved to Riot games
[3:44:04] BrewCityMonk: FF14 is my passion.
[3:44:07] adrian_fell: didnt they announce some sort of Potter RPG game not too long ago?
[3:44:07] Wenkleton: is that the best way to lvl up?
[3:44:27] mitchumtx: FFXIV is fun and all but WOW is much more fun!
[3:44:28] CCG_337: funny hear people that dont play ffxiv, talking about the stae of the game lol
[3:44:28] BrewCityMonk: And I wish City of Heroes was still around
[3:44:32] trivwik: Towelliee lookin like Johnny Bravo. /flex
[3:44:39] justdavesadly: how much gold in total have you spent?
[3:44:49] ArcaneSyntax: 700 honor away from one of the pvp weapons...soooo close
[3:44:51] KillaFin: CoH has private servers though,
[3:44:53] ElPolloBatman: ion moves to riot -> sudden increase in active wow players
[3:44:53] Scraggersmeh: They have though, Towellie.
[3:44:54] TWINTVT: @trivotixx "hey pretty mama"
[3:44:56] TheGaoSora: Ion moving to Square... and get slapped around by Yoshi Kappa
[3:44:59] mwchaos: decent chunk went to dreamhaven didnt they
[3:45:00] Scraggersmeh: Riot is the most popular destination for former blizz devs.
[3:45:03] Rottencoarse: they either went to dreamhaven or warcheif gaming right @Towelliee ?
[3:45:05] adrian_fell: devs probably dont want to make MMos considering the usual playerbase they get from it
[3:45:08] Bulgogiprince: Kaplan will go to riot after the probation period. I bet
[3:45:10] MetallicusGaming: they're tired of developing an mmo they want to do something else
[3:45:11] Lazugo: Jeff needs to go to riot i think
[3:45:15] racketpunch: If ion moved everyone would be ok with it
[3:45:22] DragonofWolves: Ok you know your custom pc is old as shit when you can run addons in TBC but not fucking retail... wow
[3:45:29] Caro_ttv: Do you think anything can come out of dreamhaven mmo wise down the lise?
[3:45:38] StoicTaurus: Most of them didn't quit because of "Blizzard", but because they wanted to do something of their own
[3:45:40] ElPolloBatman: didn't dave kosak leave?
[3:45:40] Dkgungo: what about the art guy who just left?
[3:45:40] Dundungeonsdork: hello
[3:45:51] KillaFin: @dragonofwolves I mean are you running wow on an SSD? you need an SSD for wow these days
[3:46:06] Lesrek: If those dudes wanted to make an MMO, they'd have stayed at blizz
[3:46:16] KillaFin: srsly try running wow on a gtx 3080 but on an HHD KEKWDISCO
[3:46:20] trivwik: Towelliee is making a mmo. Coming to consoles in 2055
[3:46:26] DragonofWolves: KillaFin retail yeah but my build is like 7 years old so all the parts are either discontinued or unsupported now
[3:46:26] adrian_fell: isnt it weird how people are looking for a new mmo rpg when there are so many of them right now that are out ? lol
[3:46:38] TheGaoSora: Some from HS
[3:46:41] Rottencoarse: starcraft 2
[3:46:43] ProClicker: Omar
[3:46:47] Coox69: metzen?
[3:46:51] Rottencoarse: most of the SC2 guys went to Deamhaven that i know
[3:46:52] BrewCityMonk: Until WoW have dyable armors, boobs slider and more then one new class, I'm done with it.
[3:47:12] MuttonChopins: I wonder if David Brevik will work for Dreamhaven
[3:47:14] TheUnknowing: @CooX_Raging metzens new company is tabletop games i believe, so not video games
[3:47:25] KillaFin: @dragonofwolves unfortunately, only way to get good parts for a new computer is prolly going to be from the accursed prebuilt or you know, settle with GPUs scalpers didn't bother to grab up
[3:47:28] Merex760: I'm just kinda waiting to see what Riot does at this point. League has some pretty cool lore that could translate well
[3:47:29] jkitchin75: @BrewCityMonk grow up
[3:47:42] Coox69: @TheUnknowing ah i see
[3:47:51] TheGaoSora: people looking for "Their kind" of mmo, if it's missing anything they like they won't play it
[3:47:53] MisterPooky: P2W ruins most of them, thats why they suck ass
[3:47:58] BrewCityMonk: WoW haven't had a new class since Legion, and it was only for two elf races
[3:48:08] Molvonos: Doesnt need any more classes.
[3:48:11] Molvonos: Too many as it is.
[3:48:35] plate_of_food: Man I wish a competent company took over Rift, it had so much potential but was unique enough from wow
[3:48:38] Sarocus: We just want the next WoW
[3:48:41] Drakossbane: I repsectfully disagree. They can inovate, but the mindset niow is profit at all cost
[3:48:41] PotbellyGoat: I'd rather play WoW mobile than a new IP
[3:48:42] EKS90_: a game does not need 20+ classes. as long as the classes speccs are different enough to feel good to play imo
[3:48:53] Frozen_DK: Black Desert was great if not for the lack of PvE content
[3:48:53] MrGattz: because they dont have enough stuff to balance atm, lets just add ANOTHER class into the mix to the community will complain even more that stuff isnt balanced
[3:48:55] biirrd: well the game loop need to be the same, but its all the extra around that need to chcange
[3:48:57] Sarocus: Yeah
[3:49:04] TheGaoSora: it's kinda hard to keep balancing classes when there's an Esport meta around the mmo...
[3:49:05] biirrd: how you get gear, and what gear is and what you can do with spells
[3:49:10] BrewCityMonk: @jkitchin75 yet yall are begging for those stuff! LUL
[3:49:11] Molvonos: @MrGattz But MUH TINKERS
[3:49:12] Collected1: HE KNOWS
[3:49:13] Coox69: you think so?
[3:49:14] just_laxus: i just want a new world with familiar characters like the chars from lol  like it was back when their was warcraft 3 and then wow
[3:49:15] CritcobainTV: I don't think there's ever going to be another game that completely envelops me the way wow did when i started in BC
[3:49:17] pupsgnomette: wow mobile :D
[3:49:17] Fenixzzz: he knows
[3:49:17] GCnT: World of StarCraft!!! PLEASE!!!

[3:49:56] dracullus: @Towelliee yeah, revamp would be not enough
[3:49:56] Coox69: badass
[3:49:56] MuttonChopins: so they are doing what Valve did with Source 2
[3:49:58] Merex760: That would be sick

[3:50:29] MetallicusGaming: Overlooked Kappa

[3:50:33] Collected1: anyone else get goosebumps? damn. i'm hyped now.

[4:58:25] xxshadowariesxx: Adds gone crazy
[4:58:41] tadeeche: its beautiful
[4:58:48] ZangLee: Back in TBC days, I had a Mage friend who used to do this kind of boosting for my Belf Paladin.
[4:59:00] OneCarrow: i have a giant thermaltake laptop cooling fan that works wonders for helping my laptop keep the fan noise down
[4:59:09] justdavesadly: does he have alter time? how is he teleporting back up?
[4:59:20] DarkSilver66: you dont get aggro, no. I was doing it all runs lol
[4:59:22] Isidar: i logged into tbc the other day, back in classic I had stopped her at lvl 29....i found in tbc lvl 29 was really awkward cause no one was around my lvl
[4:59:23] SteveSD: no
[4:59:24] gamernick410: No alter time @onlysabi
[4:59:25] Isidar: everyone boosted lol
[4:59:25] ElPolloBatman: gotta talk the mage into a discount for getting buffed
[4:59:26] booevil: why he doing it on your ghetto server?
[4:59:27] PennyPlaysGames: I gave him Wisdom
[4:59:30] DarkSilver66: sometimes, it wouldn't even put me into combat
[4:59:34] Collected1: imagine if one kings cast pulled agro on everything
[4:59:38] Holysal: @PennyPlaysGames he dont need wisdom
[5:00:14] shimwood: LuL
[5:00:15] tadeeche: you fucked up
[5:00:15] PennyPlaysGames: @PennyPlaysGames He does on pulls that get the little adds killed. It happens from time to time

[5:00:27] guni1980: That would be good content, if you pulled aggro :P
[5:00:33] Chiraakitteh: Would it be worth having a bunch of classes outside the instance to prebuff the mage?
[5:00:46] guni1980: But entertaining
[5:01:07] Scraggersmeh: Why is everyone in the run a BE pala lmao
[5:01:08] Isidar: May i ask how many levels ur expected to get out of this
[5:01:48] Chiraakitteh: I’m sure just paying everyone’s fee for another run would smooth it over... Kappa
[5:01:48] Selvexis: would be entertaining as well to lather up and slide around on tile flooring but we dont do that :P
[5:02:39] xxshadowariesxx: Adds for days
[5:02:42] Ultratide_: boosting xp is so good
[5:02:46] Aravarth: The Big Ding Club

[5:04:01] gamernick410: It’s 15%

[11:10:13] primerevrt: Retail burnt me out with the lack of doing nothing

[11:10:26] JonnyScotland: I loved your shadowlands youtube video, Didn't disagree with anything you said at all
[11:10:27] primerevrt: never really tried classic or tbc
[11:10:29] Putcride: For me retail im just upgrading all my covenent aspects
[11:10:37] ZagFan590: TezLive Welcome to the new Twitch and it is only going to get worse. I would recommend getting Twitch Turbo if you don't want to get ads if you watch a lot of streamers.
[11:10:38] TezLive: I really want play warrior to tbc, and be pvp focused but I feel there will be to many mage bastards to make me not have fun lol

[11:11:19] TheCliffyShow: I still got plenty to do in retail. Once I get KSM(only 3 dungeons left), I got to finish my covenant campaign, do Twisting Corridors, start some alts. I'm good for a while.
[11:11:49] Slitze: sounds like queensryche we listening to

[11:13:47] zekobunny: Retail is terrible with boosting
[11:13:59] Lavwit: Everything is boosting these days

[11:14:11] 210Crawler: 210DungeonCrawler subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 20 months! 
[11:14:23] zekobunny: Literally people would rather farm gold to buy a boost then actually have fun progressing and trying the content
[11:14:30] RenoVR: @lestanger yes they do
[11:14:47] WickedSorrow: There was boosting back in tbc and wrath, you just paid for the loot you wanted lol
[11:14:50] JonnyScotland: I just find it weird someone buying a run when they have a group of friends that's done the same content 2 weeks before. Willing to do it. I always assumed it was people who couldn't do it themselves
[11:14:52] Macroversal_: I mean.. wowHobbs was doing it way back when
[11:15:04] DaKevin10: Holy shot he’s 41
[11:15:07] SilkeySmooth: Blozzard wants boosts for token sales
[11:15:20] Macroversal_: ahhh in raids
[11:15:28] SilkeySmooth: sakws
[11:15:30] liftlaughlaef: belf pally in my guild hit 58 and is in aq40 right now lol

[11:16:30] Atruis_: You mean wow token?
[11:16:34] Macroversal_: I know people sold bear runs in ZA
[11:16:47] hammack52: god i hope so
[11:16:48] LawnSpeaker: what, like unlimited boosts?
[11:16:53] WickedSorrow: Only thing I have on retail is gold I would love to trade for TBC gold LuL
[11:17:09] Lavwit: They need to put out pristine servers then or there is really no point to classic
[11:17:12] SilkeySmooth: you will get a more traditional tbc experience on private servers then c;assoc tbc
[11:17:18] LawnSpeaker: @WickedSorrow then TBC gold would become worthless
[11:17:23] EKS90_: China already have wowtokens, will probably come to west soon ^^
[11:17:23] bumpstock75: make billion in one day from boosts... yes, they like the idea
[11:17:31] WickedSorrow: People already been doing it @LawnSpeaker
[11:17:35] TheItalianStallion321: 25g KEKW
[11:17:43] Macroversal_: they can just do dailies
[11:17:43] LawnSpeaker: Doing what?
[11:17:47] Macroversal_: or farm motes
[11:17:48] LUKA_THIM: just buy gold you wont get caught
[11:17:53] TezLive: How much gold do you start with, with the TBC Boost ?
[11:17:58] WickedSorrow: People been trading retail gold for classic and tbc gold @LawnSpeaker
[11:18:03] Macroversal_: 25g
[11:18:05] Arkitek: 25g, and once u hit 60 they take you hack to 22g~ for all the skills lol
[11:18:11] Arkitek: back

[11:19:33] Knocx: im fine with it
[11:19:35] JonnyScotland: I think they will come once the game dies down
[11:19:40] Robmit: I don
[11:19:43] Lavwit: Keep the retail crap in retail
[11:19:46] PhillyDilly18: pull the ripcord
[11:19:48] reklebin: what 20 bucks gunna be forth 1k gold
[11:19:49] SilkeySmooth: people will leave classic tbc when that happens
[11:19:51] FreeVeeThree: Selling websites have over 9 mil gold on each classic server
[11:19:54] Frank4LuLz: good, i work 60 plus hours a week, buying gold is fine by me
[11:19:57] cineris_3: would kill for shareable nodes in tbc
[11:20:00] guss2084: thats cause China #1
[11:20:00] Robmit: I don't know why people are against the tokens in classic when those same people buy gold from gold sellers
[11:20:05] IianaDRK: tokens dont fix the boost culture tho
[11:20:12] mikejames01: @Lavick81 not you choice
[11:20:15] andTHISiswhat: i mean lets be real the game is 15yrs old who really cares if they come or not into bc classic if anything it helps the devs we will play the game reguardless
[11:20:15] Shrenko: 20$ for more like 300gold
[11:20:25] Atruis_: I feel like 1k would be too much
[11:20:39] Atruis_: maybe 800g
[11:20:42] Aro725: 2k gold like 175 bucks
[11:20:49] enux337: 20 for 500
[11:20:59] SilkeySmooth: $20 for 500 gold
[11:21:04] pronkk_: id be happy with 20 for 5k
[11:21:06] the_general01: yeah right now, its 19.99 for 500 gold
[11:21:09] pronkk_: 500*
[11:21:11] WickedSorrow: $20 for 1k gold in tbc is actually pretty legit. Remember in WoD it got you 20k
[11:21:14] Sonatta: outlands gold is MUCH easier to get than vanilla gold
[11:21:18] Lavwit: @mikejames01 not yours either
[11:21:19] hammack52: i think people are underestimating the greed of people, i would not be in the least bit surprized to see the token go for over 2k gold in tbc
[11:21:21] nephandis: at $20 for 1k that's $100 for epic flying
[11:21:26] Avaricious_83: I think the fact people can get game time with their gold is great for people on lower incomes. At least they can continue to play just using gold they earn
[11:21:27] LawnSpeaker: @andTHISiswhat because it's a cheap and easy bandaid for the actual problem
[11:21:33] EKS90_: With MTX and all that, I just gotten so used to it, It ok by me, Its just how the modern market is, and it's not going to change anytime soon.
[11:21:40] mikejames01: @Lavick81 yup i know this blizz will do what they want when they wanrt

[11:22:12] toocheap2rhyme: rise of the neckbeards
[11:22:19] kingceejay90: Wait it’s only 7 hearts now? I think it was more in classic

[11:22:46] WickedSorrow: throw*
[11:22:50] HotHotHeals: 180-220
[11:22:53] kirbyfan1: What server are you on towelie
[11:22:55] LawnSpeaker: @Commander_Eggi there's mtx for cosmetics, but boosts and gold kind of removes a large part of the RPG aspect of the game
[11:22:57] ItsHammyMF: 200 at least

Send a request message in the #WoW-TBC channel in Towelliee's discord and a recruiter will be in touch! || TBC launch is on June 1st
[11:23:08] jaalexba: All they need to do is hire bot hitmen
[11:23:12] Atruis_: Or just hourly bans
[11:23:26] kingceejay90: It’s too many players for them too manage tho
[11:23:34] GombiG1: how can you buy an account? don't you have to send   a copy of your ID or something if you have any issues?
[11:23:42] Alexm305: TRUE
[11:23:45] JonnyScotland: Blizzard don't even ban the people in lfg spamming boost groups/gold selling in a resonable time, In the EU some of them are up for 3 days+ even when I report them
[11:23:59] Garrujak: Gold sellers aren't going ANYWHERE. The dirty secret of the community is that so many people buy classic gold
[11:24:00] kingceejay90: They don’t have the manpower
[11:24:01] kargdahm: Give players gold for reporting bots that get banned
[11:24:09] WickedSorrow: The wow token is the best way to combat the gold sellers. The amount you saw in retail back in WoD died down a lot real fast when tokens were released
[11:24:13] Alexm305: They need to invest more into that
[11:24:15] Just_Jaybles: hire more average joes
[11:24:16] EKS90_: @LawnSpeaker I don't mind XP pots or boosting at all, It doesn't affect my enjoyement of the game. and every mmo has it now, and compared to other mmos i still think WoWs boost is the most " ok" cause its not a maxlevel boost or a XP pot per say
[11:24:22] SmuttBudgie: Many Welps
[11:24:22] neugassh: retail has tokens and the botting is the same
[11:24:27] Just_Jaybles: give for  example you the power to ban botters
[11:24:37] zzlomg: bots pay the monthly fee aswell, do they really want to get rid of them and their money ? or just pretending ?
[11:24:46] hammack52: banning the botters wont do much, what they need to do is ban the people that buy the gold, eliminate the custimer base and the bots dry up
[11:24:47] kingceejay90: Wouldn’t work cause ppl would abuse it @jericko_ztg
[11:24:51] ThaOriginalGamester: That's what she said
[11:25:01] kingceejay90: Who would dictate if the ban is worthy @jericko_ztg
[11:25:04] Atruis_: Its just a low drop rate
[11:25:06] Avaricious_83: Did these Whelps drop the dragon pet in BC or was that later?
[11:25:08] Spathotan: I think you just forgot how bad quest drops were back then LOL
[11:25:13] Nalleys: That quest always takes me ages
[11:25:16] Wildside1177: Welps drop the tongue
[11:25:26] shimwood: I'll give ya some tongue KappaPride
[11:25:28] WickedSorrow: If people are willing to risk their account to buy illegal gold, they are more than ready to pay up for another account and do it again if they get banned @hammack52
[11:25:31] GodTheMechanic: Do these guys drop the pet that sells for big wonga?
[11:25:33] andTHISiswhat: if tokens come to bc classic thats what will slow down and eventually stop the buying gold
[11:25:43] Camino377: Anytime I'm feeling too good about myself I just go start looking for Goretusk Livers
[11:25:46] Atruis_: I had to kill like 20 whelps to finish this quest
[11:26:01] Avaricious_83: @Camino377 LOOL
[11:26:01] Moobot: Check out Towelliee's latest Youtube video! https://youtu.be/U8-64zqVa8k Shadowlands needs some help
[11:26:08] Macroversal_: I hope the pet drops
[11:26:16] mikejames01: @Lavick81 you are funny little man ingore me cause you can not handle the truth
[11:26:20] Kinghorn: the whelp quest sucks but it is worth it
[11:26:22] WickedSorrow: They used to be elites
[11:26:25] hammack52: @WickedSorrow thats just it, blizz is not really banning people for it now so how can you say that for sure
[11:26:26] Aromantis: Aromantis gifted a Tier 1 sub to Camino377! This is their first Gift Sub in the channel! 
[11:26:37] chadleyhank: Never were elites
[11:26:44] chadleyhank: In vanilla maybe but it classic
[11:26:48] chadleyhank: *not
[11:26:53] Camino377: @Aromantis Well thank you lol
[11:27:01] LawnSpeaker: @Commander_Eggi I can see how you don't mind it, but you have to understand that a lot of people enjoy the idea that character progression has weight to it
[11:27:07] WickedSorrow: because it was like that back in the day. Not to mention it's simply $15 for another account for TBC since you don't have to buy retail @hammack52
[11:27:12] hammack52: not much of a risk if blizz never does anything to you or the thousands of others out there that do it
[11:27:18] Aromantis: @Camino377 lmao np man
[11:27:31] Vaccar: @Towelliee those highlights on the gras is this a bug?
[11:27:39] Avaricious_83: Those weird lighting effects on the grass and stuff is really annoying lol

[11:28:21] EKS90_: @LawnSpeaker I enjoy char progression, im not boosting, but if I have a friend that wants to boost to 58 while im already 70 to play with me 100 hours earlier, how would that impact your char progression? it would if anything mean he and I can have fun together ingame even quicker.
[11:28:56] shimwood: AFKave

[11:30:23] Th3Hammer: Ohh baby that d2 music towHype
[11:30:41] Vexxsis: @Towelliee hows the lvling going
[11:30:43] Avaricious_83: Yeah be nice is you got the black dragon whelp pet
[11:30:49] psycothedruid: Love your new setup bud, haven't had a chance to pop in here since your remodel was done
[11:31:03] zander213: diablo immortal hype
[11:31:06] LawnSpeaker: @Commander_Eggi that's definitely a positive, I'm in the same position as you, but I still feel like the boost cheapens the experience a bit
[11:31:22] JonnyScotland: @Towelliee Shit loads of people have been getting flickering issues on all versions of wow on nvidia gpus , Even the 3000 series graphics cards, More people are getting it as weeks go by, They can't figure it out, it's in nvidias patch notes
[11:31:27] JonnyScotland: hope your new pc doens't have that issue
[11:31:57] ThaOriginalGamester: Wrath alpha
[11:31:59] cineris_3: phase 2?
[11:32:03] OGBear: sounds like a nvidia driver issue
[11:32:12] OGBear: they'll probably hammer it out
[11:32:18] kingceejay90: How much does it normally go for? @avaricious_83
[11:32:21] Mattsta: Amazon has such a bad track record right now...I'd prob play Immortal first and wait to hear what ppl say on New World
[11:32:29] Mattsta: if they came out at the same time
[11:32:32] kingceejay90: Ball park
[11:32:40] Atruis_: I have a 2060 super and have no flickering issues
[11:32:58] Johnd212: Towelliee when does the marathon start?
[11:33:01] Avaricious_83: @creativeceejay No sure as I haven't seen one since classic started but they are rare as hell so probably a small fortune
[11:33:11] Xiziusv2: I fixed the flickering on retail by manually detecing my gpu instead of letting the game auto detect it
[11:33:13] kingceejay90: Might have to farm em
[11:33:26] Avaricious_83: ikr

[11:33:41] Moondagger98: Look at all those completed quests, hot stuff
[11:33:48] EKS90_: @LawnSpeaker I hear you, Im both for it and against it on some level, like if new world would launchwith it, that would be shit, For me its more about its kinda funny how people praise FF14, but they also have a sub fee, a expansion cost and a 5 times bigger cash shop, but wow having a deluxe and a boost is the end of the game. I just don't get that part.
[11:33:54] Avaricious_83: @creativeceejay They can also drop from the Dragonkin and whelps in Wetlands
[11:34:00] JonnyScotland: @Xiziusv2 didn't work for me,  only way it goes away for me is playing on windowed mode. It's whats wrird, it seems to be different for everyone even people with same graphics cards
[11:34:01] Macroversal_: um.. no
[11:34:06] Moondagger98: It really does
[11:34:28] Dawnyan: Orange bar is the amount of exp banked in completed quests, correct?
[11:34:32] Moondagger98: Yea
[11:34:44] mikejames01: look boosts are not bad for the game
[11:35:01] enux337: i wonder how people are gonna react to a 68 boost
[11:35:16] JonnyScotland: Blizzard should add that into the actual game
[11:35:23] EKS90_: @enux337 if we are in wotlk, then its fine, since its the expansion before.
[11:35:33] Dawnyan: true
[11:35:35] Frank4LuLz: who cares
[11:35:35] Mitchendo64: Wrath?
[11:35:37] Johnd212: But we know the Internet ... They hate just to hate

[11:36:31] LawnSpeaker: @Commander_Eggi I think it's because they've watched the exact same thing happen to retail. Retail today feels like a completely different game. It has positive aspects, but you basically steamroll to the latest expansion, then ride the rollercoaster to max level
[11:36:31] Avaricious_83: I think TBC dungies were some of my faves design and layout wise

[11:38:38] laughing_octopus: @Prideth word brother
[11:38:39] LawnSpeaker: @Commander_Eggi I think the philosophy of "it's bad? ok, just skip it" rather than iterating on things like the levelling experience is what made it the way it is
[11:38:58] Gendread77: his eye brows told him to do it
[11:39:06] Broomba: thats why Towelliee is my main twitch channel i go to for 10 years -- consistent and down to earth reality. Thanks @towelliee

[11:39:27] EKS90_: @LawnSpeaker yeah getting to a point where leveling is " get it done quick or skip" is very bad for the game in the long run.

[11:40:50] nightmayor12: Tbf you did post a video back in like early '18 saying you werent going to play classic.
[11:40:55] synergeetv: On top of being on a high pop server
[11:41:00] crotastar: People will never realize this is the times of gaming now
[11:41:07] Sonatta: no, he doesn't try, he can't even win his own mount offs anymore because he doesn't put in the work to get the new mounts @synergeetv
[11:41:25] sensoji_cx: Hi all just need some advice if anyone knows what professions to get for a enha shamy

[11:41:45] Veruhn: herb/alc
[11:41:49] LawnSpeaker: @Commander_Eggi Yeah, I hope they don't keep going down that route with classic... in the long run I think it will actually be bad for their bottom line as well
[11:41:50] Rhazin_: is this where it gonna stop BC? or wrath
[11:41:53] RingoDingoDoo: wait, that's not a dwarf!
[11:41:57] Moondagger98: Woah man, that's whelpist.

[11:42:42] Sonatta: pull an Asmon and watch youtube videos for a 2 hours @Towelliee
[11:42:53] EKS90_: @LawnSpeaker im ok with 1 boost per account, and thats it, ^^ cause i love the leveling, hence why i have almost 4 60's, but i can see someone wanting to play tbc and not SLOG through it ^^ but 1 boost per account to me is acceptable.
[11:42:54] ThatTuesdayGuy: the shadeee lol

[11:54:56] LAXNESS: vrykul
[11:54:58] maklayy: towel I was 40 when u started ur belf, now im 44 and ur 41 bruh how
[11:54:58] nightmayor12: at this rate we arent even sure we are going to get a 9.2
[11:54:59] givemeyourshoes: Kinda wish the prepatch was 3 weeks not 2
[11:55:04] cbiskit89: i remember tbc rumors that naga were going to be playable... still waiting
[11:55:16] bruhSit_farmer: was there an alliance Draenei quest hub added to swamp of sorrows with tbc ?
[11:55:21] DaKevin10: I love wow. But low key to excited to see the end. Like how does that go down lol
[11:55:24] Dawnyan: I'm deeply curious about Riot's MMO
[11:55:30] Macroversal_: man why give us naga and not dragons..
[11:55:30] Grady2385: @Towelliee back in the day when you was on top of twitch you was getting about 30k views right
[11:55:33] Dawnyan: but it's not coming for another 5 years
[11:55:39] Grady2385: the good old warrior days
[11:55:39] BaldPanda360: i thought the riot MMO was cancelled?
[11:55:46] Dawnyan: Riot is always F2P
[11:55:47] givemeyourshoes: FTP with microtransactions up the ass
[11:55:47] Grady2385: man i miss those days
[11:55:52] MooBerZ87: @Towelliee are you on your paladin?
[11:55:52] Willamd: anything with ten cent or king is always Micro heavy
[11:55:53] d1stract10n: FtP mmo on phone
[11:55:57] neugassh: tencent have shares in everything
[11:55:58] CritcobainTV: Runescape
[11:55:59] Camino377: I was excited for Everquest Next, until Daybreak dropped it for H1Z1
[11:56:02] CritcobainTV: EZ
[11:56:11] Frank4LuLz: SWTOR???
[11:56:12] Dawnyan: f2p + mmo is usually not a great combo
[11:56:12] Moobot: Check out Towelliee's latest Youtube video! https://youtu.be/U8-64zqVa8k Shadowlands needs some help
[11:56:15] Frank4LuLz: LOL
[11:56:15] im_clam: warframe is a successfil mmo
[11:56:22] Judgejudyx: what addons tracking your leveling speed
[11:56:23] Moobot: Calm it with those symbols, @KappaSlasher (warning)
[11:56:26] tigzie: swtor was not released as a free to play game
[11:56:29] Moondagger98: !wa
[11:56:29] Moobot: @Moondagger98 we use Luxthos's WeakAuras! You can find all his WAs at wago.io/search/luxthos |You can find the leveling EXP bar here! | wago.io/LuxthosExperienceBar
[11:56:30] bruhSit_farmer: riot mom will probs be too e-sporty imo
[11:56:35] bruhSit_farmer: mm0*
[11:56:41] DaKevin10: Exciting right?
[11:56:44] Thoreya: maybe itll be p2w but like 5 bucks a month
[11:56:45] IianaDRK: tera did well
[11:56:46] Thoreya: p2p
[11:56:47] Willamd: too much incentive to add PTW in free to play
[11:56:48] Thoreya: *
[11:56:55] hotlocaldadxo: Lookin good Big T
[11:57:05] Dawnyan: I could imagine a subscription for it honestly
[11:57:15] BrainGushersTV: they do have a moba and csgo/overwatch like game next stop would be mmo LUL
[11:57:20] Dawnyan: both wow and ff14 have subs and are the most successful MMOs
[11:57:28] nightmayor12: Asmon is malding rn
[11:57:28] MooBerZ87: is there a way to get and use you UI for my paladin?
[11:57:32] Thoreya: 11 min que for mankrik rn i swear im just gonna realm transfer outta this shit
[11:57:37] Dawnyan: I hope they don't do transmog like destiny 2 does it
[11:57:38] bruhSit_farmer: doubt it'll be a traditional mmorpg it'll be instance based and full e-sports
[11:57:47] Macroversal_: they can subs because they have the pull imo
[11:57:49] Dawnyan: they'll probably sell tons of cosmetics in the shop
[11:57:52] Macroversal_: can have*
[11:57:53] Mattsta: GW2 did a lot of cash shop transmog...not a fan of that
[11:57:54] Dawnyan: mounts, gear, etc.
[11:57:55] Dawnyan: toys
[11:57:55] DaKevin10: I say no way a riot mmo fails. But then hero’s of the storm did with blizzard
[11:58:10] Atruis_: I hate MMOs that have bad looking gear/mounts in-game, but then they have the cool armor and mounts in-store only.
[11:58:12] xsveninatorx: player homes?
[11:58:16] TheDeathbinder: the theme is what concerns me the most
[11:58:19] JonnyScotland: I actually liked heroes of the storm lol
[11:58:22] CritcobainTV: @kgruszecki10 HoTS wasnt' an mmo
[11:58:24] NovaSun84: If people were angry about the online cash shop... would they... RIOT? mrmHmm
[11:58:30] Dawnyan: I mean cosmetic gear*
[11:58:35] Dawnyan: hopefully not actual gear
[11:58:36] QuArEnTeNa2: the worse case scenario for me is QOL store
[11:58:40] lilblackguy: idk i feel f2p can bring alot of cheaters/botters to any game/genre maybe like a low monthly fee 7.50 after a base buy price
[11:58:50] DaKevin10: I know. But same concept. U believe in the company
[11:59:07] BrutalHermit: It will be like Guild Wars 2. Just a bunch of cosmetic stuff for sale.
[11:59:20] CritcobainTV: I did not, for one second think that HoTs was gonna be a good game, i thought it was interesting, but i didn't ever see it being as good as lol or dota
[11:59:21] bruhSit_farmer: will an e-sport centred mmorpg be successful though
[11:59:33] Templexx: only mmo i got my $ on.
[11:59:41] Dawnyan: I enjoy HotS as a different experience to league

[11:59:46] Yendar: His Dev Watercoolers were always interesting to read.
[11:59:53] JonnyScotland: Everyone bitching about the wow store, should see the final fantasy store. it's 100x worse
[11:59:55] Dawnyan: HotS has very interesting hero designs compared to Leagues, which tend to be a lot simpler
[11:59:59] Torne81: Convenience items, CD potions like BDO
[12:00:05] kyshen3: I hope it lights a fire under blizz, because Blizz sure as shit needs it.
