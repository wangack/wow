[0:49:47] TheUnknowing: for the moneys
[0:49:53] tripl3heart: must be because the reveneu they miss with the time and effort for the 6 month sub mount, they miss a lot of money from it
[0:49:54] Bogzeh: so u sub and forget to cancel instead
[0:49:54] dimofodi: Guaranteed $30 instead of $15
[0:49:58] Cartharon: you can forget to unsuscribe = money

[0:50:57] MrGattz: @Nemesis_ well yeah there was. if you sub, there is a chance you forget that you are subbed. remember the best way for companies to make money is to have you forget you are subbed to something. thats why ea play is a thing, game pass, netflix, hulu, you name it all have subs.

[1:30:05] Mcfailadin: F
[1:30:45] Archrade: @Skaun I meant early 60s, with high armor very tanky for leveling
[1:31:00] Skaun: oh ok

[1:31:59] Mcfailadin: granny is on fire gotta go
[1:32:05] mrrazputin: Towellie can you explain what is the point in sinking tenth or hundreds hours into Beta now when you will be playing it later again ?
[1:32:06] PrimalRain: towHAMUP
[1:32:07] valth: towHAMUP towHAMUP towHAMUP towHAMUP towHAMUP

[1:33:13] raldrik: RIP Giveaways
[1:33:15] Kagoon46: yes
[1:33:20] Darkbrawny: yup
[1:33:24] MrGattz: it also means that your giveaways towelliee will be 60 days now and not 30
[1:33:24] Moobot: towGreen Shadowlands Limited Edition TOWELLIEE covenant shirts AND Towelliee hats are LIVE! check them out HERE! | Dbh.la/towelliee towBlue
[1:33:27] Cyberangel89: they still exist here in Belgium
[1:33:29] NILLme: new and returning players are forced to sub for 2 months
[1:33:33] Cyberangel89: 60 days card
[1:33:34] jasperboy: wait what, are they removing the 30 days in EU aswell?
[1:33:37] MrGattz: @NiLLx_ no.
[1:33:42] Fragoor: Fucking scam company
[1:33:44] CaptainTrips8: Time cards were my jam when I worked at GameStop, until they made it so our discounts didn't work on them
[1:33:52] swordwindgaming: Forcing 60 day commitments wtf.
[1:33:56] luckfore: what about that just wanna try it for 30 days?
[1:33:56] Archrade: This might be to stop botters
[1:34:03] Naturalbeef: Not this. The Wow community doesn't understand the difference between game time and a subscription
[1:34:08] KronasKG: So prevent people from wanting to dip in.
[1:34:10] MrGattz: its not forcing anything. you just need to sub for 30 days and then unsub.
[1:34:10] Archrade: I am not sure how it will affect it though
[1:34:10] HaxzorJimDuggan: all this really means is @Towelliee now has to give away 2 months of game time instead of just 1 Kappa
[1:34:10] Sollice: How does this affect tokens?
[1:34:14] xxKrayzie: it doesnt stop botters
[1:34:17] WarmWetTight: and they dont fix vpn to argentina issue
[1:34:17] robertjordan83: @Towelliee so they did this bc you cant basically pay for free if you have enough gold via bnet balance convesion. you cannot pay for sub with bnet balance. so if you were paying for bnet balanace you now have to pay for 60 days at full price instead of 90 or 180 days at discount
[1:34:18] Sincline387: No affect to tokens
[1:34:19] Sollice: So do you have to buy a 60 day token to sell for gold?
[1:34:21] MrGattz: there is no more 30 day gametime cards
[1:34:25] Sincline387: no affects to subs
[1:34:32] MrGattz: it does not affect tokens
[1:34:35] Sollice: ok
[1:34:37] Fragoor: That money is pocket change for botters, they are only fucking normal customers
[1:34:40] Ambersulfr: Good morning @Towelliee! towHAMUP
[1:34:40] KaisenSiru: Tokens are unaffected.
[1:34:41] Archrade: Is there a way to stop botting @Towelliee ?
[1:34:42] MrGattz: 1 token is still 30 days
[1:34:48] MrGattz: @Archrade yes.
[1:34:52] Sincline387: if you want a single month pay for a sub and cancel it
[1:34:55] Critzy_1209: this option is stupid. does that mean tokens are going to double in price cause the tokens will be 2 months instead of the 30
[1:34:57] constantinfive: u dont do 6 months?
[1:35:01] Speshulist: I do 6 months because... I been playing for 12 years, i'm not going to stop anytime soon haha
[1:35:05] HaxzorJimDuggan: ff14 game time cards are also only 60 days
[1:35:14] MrGattz: iv been trying to get blizzard to hire me for years to help with the cheating issue and they never get back to me FeelsBadMan
[1:35:23] MrGattz: they just dont care
[1:35:25] Sincline387: @critzy1995 if you read the article it says zero changes to tokens
[1:35:26] Ambersulfr: Response time on botting isn't awful, I've reported them and they usually get whacked within 48 hours.
[1:35:33] Amarlian: as long as people still buying services from them, there is no stopping
[1:35:33] inj0shwetrust: WOoooooooo
[1:35:35] Ambersulfr: They're just really fast at getting back up.
[1:35:39] neverbornlucky: doesnt bother me
[1:35:42] inj0shwetrust: Just got the Molly mount finally
[1:35:44] jasperboy: tokens are still 20 euro on EU tho
[1:35:54] Critzy_1209: @ambevsulfr we will see
[1:35:55] Sincline387: guys
[1:35:56] Shamwise: couple hundred....lol
[1:35:59] Valdur359: @Towelliee  if you  buy 1 month sub and immediately cancel it do you lose the game time or not?
[1:36:00] Sincline387: NO CHANGES TO TOKENS
[1:36:04] Sincline387: it's in the article
[1:36:14] Rujean: So the subs remain the same: buy in 1, 3 and 6 months format, and at the same price?
[1:36:16] Archrade: @Valdur359 you dont
[1:36:16] Sincline387: @Valdur359 you do not
[1:36:22] Speshulist: @Valdur359 no
[1:36:23] Samaellus: @Valdur359  nope you dont
[1:36:23] Amarlian: My favorite was when bots would die in the pattern of their website name. at least that was creative
[1:36:26] Chuck108: do you know if anyone has tested the hunter macro yet to see if it works?
[1:36:27] StreamElements: Play Star Trek Fleet Command now! Available on the App Store and Google Play https://strms.net/StarTrek_Towelliee_Bot . If you are on Mobile, click the link in the command, PC users can open your camera on your phone and scan the QR code to download :)
[1:36:32] Valdur359: oh so its basicly the same
[1:36:32] Archrade: It only cancels re-paying next-month from your card
[1:36:46] Sincline387: @Valdur359 yes
[1:36:46] Speshulist: @Towelliee overwatch has the same issue.  They just keep buying accounts
[1:36:48] HaxzorJimDuggan: People are here to reeeee not to read
[1:36:55] Archrade: @Valdur359 Yeah, it is same but the smalles you can buy is 60 days now
[1:37:09] constantinfive: resub + boosting
[1:37:09] NILLme: for SL they can easily hurt the bots by removing the exp gain from herbs and mines. Thats how the farm bots lvl
[1:37:12] PhillyRhino: Blizz should take a more proactive approach to banning bots. they just keep coming back on new accounts. that's a money maker for them
[1:37:14] Sincline387: When I panic about a change, I make sure to not read the article to understand it
[1:37:15] Ambersulfr: If you report it it's quick. If you run by them and don't report it will be a while.
[1:37:35] WhiteKnight74648: "Bobby needs a 2 week vacation to Hawaii.  Quick ban the bots so we have enough income." Kappa
[1:37:35] Moobot: towHAMUP Follow Towelliee on twitter so you can be in the know at all times! | twitter.com/towelthetank towKawaii
[1:37:49] Skaun: blizz can go in the dungeons and see it though right?
[1:38:00] HaxzorJimDuggan: i was camped a bot until it was spawning on the graveyard
[1:38:03] HaxzorJimDuggan: i once
[1:38:04] Sollice: You all might as well get use to the bots anyways. In a few years they are going to be our robot overlords. So may as well make nice with them now so we get put in the good Matrix and not the shitty one. towBeep towBeep towJesus towJesus
[1:38:24] mmrghost7: do u think they wll let ppl to test lvl 70 content ?
[1:38:42] Ambersulfr: Usually they do, eventually. They'll need to test the raids.
[1:38:46] graysprings: Good evening gentlemen
[1:39:10] SonofHorus82: I've seen Bajheera get into BF almost every time he's been on for beta.
[1:39:15] ncsu_riggs: Why do they need tests when they had years of it back in the day?
[1:39:15] Nerendis: Not testing because of time? Or hassle? Or?
[1:39:40] HaxzorJimDuggan: they need to see if the pre nerfs are actually applied right
[1:39:43] Ambersulfr: I don't blame you. Un-nerfed bosses are no joke.
[1:39:47] NILLme: im actually happy that im not on the beta, wanna experience it fresh
[1:39:58] danoh_64: You still rockin the Aegis denim mod?
[1:40:09] HaxzorJimDuggan: hopefully they test different ways to implement drums
[1:40:10] Skaun: i would really like to try this beta, i wonder if they will let everyone try at some point
[1:40:11] bry8890: How do you have a BE paladin already in TBC? Did they let you boost him for testing pourposes?
[1:40:31] padrav: How big of a disadvantage do you think you are boosting rather then lvling now to 60 with max profs
[1:40:43] Sincline387: @bry8890 it's a beta, they have premades for testing
[1:40:43] MrClaudeSeaburn: Good thing

[1:40:54] retiiful: vendoring motes monkaS
[1:40:56] Speshulist: @bry8890 i think that was the only option was to make one of their prebuilt ones
[1:40:59] Archrade: Floyd Pinkus --> Pink Floyd
[1:41:06] Speshulist: @bry8890 or start from scratch
[1:41:11] MrClaudeSeaburn: @Towelliee Do you like it so far?
[1:41:16] bry8890: Ah thats cool
[1:41:19] gayfuI: why did he vendor the motes? arent they worth alot?
[1:41:25] SonofHorus82: the "organization" of your bags is giving me a brain ache.
[1:41:27] retiiful: its beta doesnt really matter

[1:53:58] bruhSit_farmer: think the 30 to 60 day sub minimum with bnet balance is partly because of the decline in revenue ?
[1:54:16] CDubTheRIPper: LUL
[1:54:22] Sollice: Pre Order ( March 2021 )

[1:55:08] oszolom45: i heard they know better what we need then we are
[1:55:11] MrGattz: @hjo1992 its because its a sub. the easiest way for a company to make money is for people to forget to cancel their subs and a LOT of people just use the 30 day gametime option.
[1:55:12] Desertrage78: I want the sour apple flavor in cans
[1:55:12] Sollice: @Mecabeast This is a fruit bunch eque flavor https://gfuel.com/collections/g-fuel/products/tropical-rain-tub

[1:56:57] Sollice: Too much trouble to cancel, I just let it keep going lol
[1:57:03] Templexx: happy friday bois
[1:57:04] EggwithEdges: It's funny that people want Wildstar private server but didn't play when it was live, asd
[1:57:10] Skaun: @OhNoNotAgain i do remember @Towelliee wild star streams :p
[1:57:15] retiiful: was always a daily iirc
[1:57:19] Kromede: Eggy_Z true FeelsBadMan
[1:57:27] Archrade: it was daily pvp
[1:57:33] Kisswani: @Kromede VoHiYo
[1:57:37] Sollice: The world wasnt ready for Wildstar, we are ready now though
[1:57:40] Kromede: Kisswani POGGERS
[1:57:44] geokouts: pvp is at level 10 it needs hours to get there without having the speed ups for the construction and research
[1:57:50] goofywizard: well some didnt get the chance to play wildstar so it would make sense for private servers
[1:57:58] CDubTheRIPper: LUL
[1:58:00] MrGattz: @Sollice yeah you know its a thing. and then you remember to do it but at that moment your just kinda to tired to bother. then twitch ends up stealing all your money
[1:58:06] ncsu_riggs: Is there a Wildstar pri server? I'd play now. Bored shitless with crappy WoW
[1:58:11] Maldinger_der_Edellurker: i did not like the combatsystem
[1:58:18] Kahoolo: I started playing Arch Age Unchained again. Haven‚Äôt played it in a long time since  the first edition dropped.
[1:58:19] Sollice: :)
[1:58:21] retiiful: tbh i miss rift
[1:58:31] MrGattz: @ncsu_riggs there was. idk if there still is

[1:58:35] thefatCheetah: guild wars 3 wen
[1:58:35] Shugaze: what wow expansion we were when wildstar was at its peak?
[1:58:35] retiiful: does anyone even still play rift anymore
[1:58:35] DoubleNova: Rift was lit in the hay days
[1:58:37] Kromede: Kahoolo ewww whyyy?
[1:58:41] mrbizhop545: Rift had promise
[1:58:43] Squintymonk31: OG rift was really good
[1:58:48] Jeraiya2: LUL
[1:58:49] ncsu_riggs: Rift, ESO, SWTOR and Wildstar were all great.
[1:58:50] MrGattz: @TheFatCheetah i dont think there will ever be a gw3
[1:58:54] EggwithEdges: Hardcore tho
[1:58:56] Ambersulfr: Can't play everything, plenty of good games have died.
[1:59:00] maccaruso: SWTOR is still going
[1:59:04] stratiss: WS came out at a bad time.
[1:59:04] MrGattz: just like there would never be a gta6
[1:59:05] CDubTheRIPper: ooo it was D that i did the raid with LUL
[1:59:06] Maldinger_der_Edellurker: i miss swtor vanilla :(
[1:59:10] mrbizhop545: I played Wildstar on launch for like 2 weeks and dropped it
[1:59:10] Grimslasher: i miss City of Heroes
[1:59:13] thefatCheetah: just more xpacs for ever now
[1:59:20] robertjordan83: @Towelliee wish wildstar would get the ff14 treatment
[1:59:23] mrpresbaby: Hydromate Gang!
[1:59:26] Shugaze: I still play Warhammer Online and do city raids (pserver)
[1:59:27] Ambersulfr: Warhammer Online ;-;
[1:59:27] mrbizhop545: but I was sad to see it shut down
[1:59:32] Nerendis: Oh right, Sea Monkeys are in this expac
[1:59:32] Syllvn: I 100% would, I was one of the fan sites for WildStar xD My pupper is in Thayd!
[1:59:33] stratiss: If the market was as thirsty today as it was in 2014 WS would've succeeded
[1:59:37] ncsu_riggs: SWTOR had the best leveling experience of all MMORPGs, IMO
[1:59:38] Kromede: i tried wildstar, i even bought it, but than i got headache everytime i played it. was not the only one FeelsBadMan
[1:59:40] Kahoolo: @kromede I think the class system is pretty unique in the sense that you pick three subclasses to make up your overall class.
[1:59:43] Subvertron: Did you see asmon watched your video Toweliee?
[1:59:43] Skaun: @alwi1501 i bought that game and tried to play it 4 times, just wasnt for me :(
[1:59:52] othraerir: it's to your left
[2:00:08] MrGattz: @stratiss yeah, your probly right. but also wildstar came out when WoD was out right? so if it didnt succeed then...
[2:00:14] Kromede: Kahoolo the game is good Kahoolo but the company behind FeelsBadMan
[2:00:18] JoeyBagadonuts: @Grimslasher Theres very popular private servers up
[2:00:20] Shok1597: one where ilum actually works
[2:00:23] StraightErro: I remember when Towelliee was streaming Rift and Elwar was the GM's name? Spawned the hardest raid boss on him for laughs
[2:00:36] theboxoffloot: you ran past it
[2:00:40] MrGattz: @Towelliee drink water
[2:00:40] Ambersulfr: Perfect timing! :D
[2:00:42] 2MomsHoldingDeez: gang bang atpFeelsBeardMan
[2:00:53] Abbat16: @Towelliee  when do u expect prepatch to come out?
[2:00:54] Kromede: StraightErro oh yes, ELRAR was his name, man was he awesome
[2:01:04] bruhSit_farmer: yea if wildstar didnt succeed with wod out, literally the golden opportunity to steal the crown
[2:01:04] thefatCheetah: swtor leveling is perfect right now especailly for just enjoying the story
[2:01:23] dakoko: it looks like a small table
[2:01:28] Kahoolo: I think they need to fix the SWTOR engine. Shit can barely handle pvp
[2:01:30] EggwithEdges: Imperial Agent story was so good
[2:01:31] AureliusXV: hard pass on tbc lmao

[2:56:15] abdarahyin: I consider Cata to be the beginning of retail.
[2:56:18] Grahamxo: i would not mind them buying discord and then having it pre installed on all windows instead of skype!

[3:38:03] elbinn: big
[3:38:07] ahla03: @Towelliee aren't you afraid you'll just get burnout by playing beta? it was mostly what happened to classic wow where most streamers burned out on the game even before launch
[3:38:10] ododaz: Like one of the worlds top warriors in retail, but his ass died to mines lmao
[3:38:25] ArcaneSyntax: thats a shaman neck bruh
[3:38:29] Flakkinator: @Clicklesly They are. I think 68 or 70.
[3:38:50] MrFuzzynuts420: @towelliee is prot pally going to be the meta in TBC or will tanks like bear be as good?
[3:39:09] CritcobainTV: Make the rogue disarm towRee

[3:39:19] OJWestTV: @Towelliee you watched falcon and the winter soldier?

[3:39:26] Daledo907: The mines are like 1800 aoe damage a pop
[3:39:45] Shugaze: these guys hit hard i remember
[3:40:09] yunggluten: @MrFuzzynuts420 Paladins are really good heroic and later raid tanks. Warriors and Druids are exceptional tanks. You can't go wrong with any of the three
[3:40:27] Daledo907: Just wait till Shadow Labs
[3:40:30] Necrobone: pally tank was horrible to play with on TBC, nobody likes you or want you for raid, not sure if is going to change now with more player knowledge

[3:40:56] Padarius: Hey all Happy Friday

[3:41:34] raymond3195: most bc will be retail players so should not be a problem
[3:41:39] elbinn: Is righteous fury still 60% threat or was it changed?
[3:41:45] BRUTALIT0PS: I hear Panda has like 500 keys to giveaway Kappa

[3:42:13] Ranger208: Could you take engeneering to help with threat?
[3:42:15] elbinn: I feel like if it was 100% threat that would help a ton with initial threat. Throw a shield and consecration
[3:42:28] idiotnumber5: this boss hurts
[3:42:30] Daledo907: Thats why weapon damage doesn't really matter to prot Pallys

[3:43:05] metavahn231: why bring a useless warrior to dungeon LUL
[3:43:11] Shugaze: these fuckers hit hard
[3:43:21] Necrobone: @HBsumo It was my worst expansion because of the bullying, I have that nail  on my heart still, I wonder if I can remove it and shows how wrong they were now :). On lich king that changed though, but you know... sad times, a whole bad expansion because of others
[3:44:08] Shugaze: @necrobone damn sad to hear! you will be fine in 2021 tbc
[3:44:09] shortyforthewin: haha

[3:46:09] Descina: this dungeon was always rough, just made it more fun
[3:46:11] shortyforthewin: its a pain but fun too learn the strategy

[4:01:49] jmr2015: boost 1 play 1
[4:02:00] GoodBoy955: you watch react videos while you get boosted @Towelliee KEKW
[4:02:08] Riddert__: @Diet_Coke_Dude wont hurt but people looking like either clowns or badasses is part of vanilla-wotlk imo
[4:02:09] dooks98: 5man prot pala dungeon clearing when they introduce BELF is gonna be fun

[4:03:11] cowthulhu1: raiding will be a joke in BC also.
[4:03:12] GoodBoy955: :/
[4:03:14] ChrisZs: i dont get it why i cant boost my alliance shaman blizz says they bring in a boost to bring players in that dont want to play classic and want to play with their  friends but u can not play what u want because of the dreanei/bloodelf sht
[4:03:15] The_Bark_: Glad they're doing pre-nerf bosses for tbc so they have more health and hit harder, might at least make it a bit more challenging
[4:03:19] jeneraljelly: Lotta people struggled on firemaw
[4:03:28] MrGattz: @Towelliee what time is your sponsored thing starting?
[4:03:39] Chaosruler: It's like that comic where the frost mage keeps messing up and they are like he used to be our number 1 dps in vanilla!
[4:03:39] Skaboy_TV: Yeah, watching my old Onyxia FRAPS from Vanilla. OMG it's sooo slow and easy.
[4:03:42] k_2lhu: Love 15 straight adds
[4:03:51] vindicator69: same
[4:03:57] toobaked1987: @Towelliee did you already watch Asmon reacting to your awesome video?
[4:03:58] Urebaldd: Fraps man good times
[4:04:20] jeneraljelly: how fast do you think kara will get cleared? 3-4 days?
[4:04:31] RedHeadNurse: naxx is no joke haha
[4:04:33] Kinghorn: yeah I have some friends still chugging away in naxx
[4:04:35] Thills_: ya on my server theres guilds that havent even cleared naxx fully yet
[4:04:37] Nilpointnil: most guilds havent cleared naxx
[4:04:41] Ranger208: After watching yall's Sire kill I can say all that is too much for me lol. I'll stick with my slow ass raiding.
[4:04:41] The_Bark_: Like aseed or something
[4:04:46] FancyJTS: Just started a troll shaman on Azuresong. People are so chill on this server.
[4:04:52] Heos90: is prince safe spot gonna be patched
[4:04:52] Yrrolol: Classic is more about parsing and speed. And to not loose world buffs. Hence there are quite big stakes in each raid.
[4:05:12] Kinghorn: yeah I love the server FancyJTS couple bad apples but every server has em
[4:05:17] Thills_: another reason why TBC is better, fuck worldbuffs
[4:05:17] Moobot: Check out Towelliee's latest Youtube video! https://youtu.be/U8-64zqVa8k Shadowlands needs some help

[4:08:10] GetSomeLoGiK: He didnt agree on the artifact

[4:08:27] Kinghorn: towHi niki
[4:08:27] Samaellus: Well, not anymore
[4:08:30] ododaz: Asmon's chat is stupid, either if asmon himself isn't
[4:08:36] toobaked1987: @Towelliee I dont know why Sloot wants that kind of stress.
[4:08:43] Phunky_Phan: POGGERS
[4:08:48] ododaz: even*
[4:08:52] Shugaze: @ododaz yea asmon kept arguing with his chat

[4:09:21] Kromede: pay 2 win POGGERS
[4:09:24] dozilla: lets be honest, blizzard isn't the same company and the state of WoW is a reflection of that plus it's age
[4:09:31] CDubTheRIPper: he said that was a route a good amount of people will take
[4:09:33] mhgamerkid1337: u say 2.1mil
[4:09:35] Wulfgrym: they said asmon boosted and he got pissed about it
[4:09:35] ododaz: @Phunky_Phan Yep
[4:09:37] Throdio: Wow should at least have a patch coming soon at this point
[4:09:37] Maldinger_der_Edellurker: pay 2 play POGGERS
[4:09:47] jeneraljelly: I just think its a bad look when people that play the game for a living are buying a boost for gear lol
[4:09:48] Maldinger_der_Edellurker: pay 2 not play POGGERS
[4:09:55] Kinghorn: should is the key word
[4:09:58] cthyt7: Always about the money
[4:10:00] Kinghorn: big should
[4:10:00] bordibag: 9.1 is months away
[4:10:01] Throdio: It's Blizzard soon
[4:10:01] Mathhbm: 3 months until 9.1
[4:10:05] MrGattz: its soon. but its blizzard soon. sometime in the next 6 months
[4:10:08] NinjaGlovz: True
[4:10:10] Alaquane: They saw Towelliee playing FF14 and they pulled the emergency broken beta launch maneuver
[4:10:13] LegoCoin: good I need more time to do stuff still in Shadowlands - I am slow playing it
[4:10:18] metavahn231: tbc stalling for content
[4:10:22] LegoCoin: << to casual
[4:10:23] beastboy0503: How is retail doing vs classic
[4:10:23] Throdio: Oh I'm expecting June
[4:10:47] slatester: isn't 9.1 more of the same, just a continued story and a new raid?
[4:10:56] Zubberikan: Is there a reason it's gonna take that long?

[4:11:58] Cranghoul: empowered conduits wtf
[4:12:00] Riggoz1: @Towelliee any idea why we are not even getting live QA.. feels communication has gone silent
[4:12:12] ninpon: NotLikeThis
[4:12:18] xiamrs: it will be tested when its live :P
[4:12:19] Pufendorf99: 2021?

[4:12:27] slatester: flying seems kind of pointless when there's no good reason to do dailies
[4:12:28] iam_jackaN: 24h classic tbc stream PogU
[4:12:34] 91Niki: No 2050 Kappa
[4:12:36] MrGattz: @Riggoz1 you know i kinda forgot about those. probly cause they dont want to say anything atm
[4:12:45] jaalexba: Blizzard should fly in APES to speed up the process.
[4:12:49] Nilpointnil: summer is bad time to release game
[4:12:58] Skaun: FreeCon
[4:13:09] Thills_: how is summer a bad time lol
[4:13:11] Ges0: last may/early june is the "best" time for tbc to launch. It's right inbetween quarter calls for Blizzard so they can flood both with boosts/xfers from tbc
[4:13:13] luckfore: cant they just post some blue posts with their thoughts on 9,1?
[4:13:24] Ges0: late*
[4:13:24] Sniped23: Honestly that‚Äôs a really good strategy or plan that blizzard has to release TBC a cup once before the new patch into release the patch when your world comes out blizzard has always released updates or new games whenever another big MMO game comes out
[4:13:27] Padarius: 60 day paid subs now though
[4:13:40] 91Niki: @Nilpointnil It's a bad time for the casual "nerds" who go outside Kappa
[4:13:44] Alienfromger: but do they should please the shareholders or playerbase?
[4:13:47] rockysimracing: business has no emotion - its facts, investors want their money...business needs to have goals
[4:13:48] Daledo907: I think pre patch will be mid to late April and TBC follows a month or 2 later.
[4:13:48] metavahn231: now now be honest
[4:13:49] CritcobainTV: @Towelliee what do you mean? Ion literally told us that working from home hasn't impacted the expansion at all? Do you not trust his word? KEKW
[4:13:54] elandura: lol another WoD ? ... oof...
[4:13:56] Jakodin: or there won't be a 10.0 any time soon

[4:13:56] NickLeonhearth: I think its impossible for them to cut 9.3, they dont want another WoD for sure
[4:13:57] ododaz: They also fired tons of their workers lmao
[4:13:57] maccaruso: Trust me.  Wall Street already knows about adjusted revenue estimations by Blizzard
[4:13:59] EggwithEdges: @Padarius 1 month sub is still a thing
[4:14:02] MrGattz: no, its still 30 day subs. they removed the 30 day gametime option.
[4:14:05] mrpresbaby: Starting Tuesday in MN anyone over 16 can get it
[4:14:07] Cartharon: i am so worried that they could have a great story, but minus one patch may screw it up :/
[4:14:08] mrpresbaby: thank god
[4:14:10] Pufendorf99: just calm down , Im sure they'll "compensate" us with a new pet
[4:14:14] metavahn231: but arent you a shareholder?
[4:14:14] just_kirk_: Got my vaccine on the blacck market here in fl
[4:14:19] BlueBeast33: I need more than a new raid and mega dungeon to actually get excited. They need to do a lot of work with Torghast as well as the outdoor content.
[4:14:19] Deathu: wow and my country doesn't even have vacinese for the elderly and public ... @Towelliee
[4:14:20] MrFuzzynuts420: @towelliee is this WoD 2.0?
[4:14:23] Wulfgrym: hopefully we don't get a variant the screws over the vaccine
[4:14:31] lanara233: Do you think they'll announce 10.0 at the next Blizzcon?
[4:14:44] RocketMan23: im sorry but working from home shouldnt be an excuse anymore, its been a year they should have adapted in the first 3 months
[4:14:46] Sniped23: @towelliee WOTLK a year from now? Cant remember how long between classic and now has been
[4:14:46] ATV93: morning guildies
[4:14:46] Phunky_Phan: gachiHYPER
[4:14:49] TiredCarcass: mega dungeon sounds kind of cool
[4:14:54] scema12: Who the fuck gets a vaccine on the black market Jesus lol that‚Äôs sketch @kirknas7y
[4:14:59] Jakodin: when karazhan came out in legion that was enough to keep me entertained for that patch tbh
[4:15:02] kokochris: I want grindable gear like benthic.
[4:15:05] CritcobainTV: Towelliee goes into new raids with his cock just fucking SWINING. Intimidation factor Kreygasm
[4:15:12] CritcobainTV: swinging*
[4:15:13] Jericco8: @Sniped23 2 years from now

[4:15:23] jeneraljelly: I dont rely on blizz for any new content pepega :(
[4:15:25] southy97: Is the mega dungeon gonna be in M+ in 9.1 or is that later?
[4:15:35] bordibag: @Towelliee how can you stand the maw
[4:15:41] Sniped23: @jericco8 that‚Äôs seems really long
[4:15:45] BlueBeast33: I want to play an MMO for more than just instanced content. I like new raids but I'm tired of the same formula.
[4:15:50] Burnski: the maw is such a turn off to me, so any new maw content, i'm out
[4:16:01] CritcobainTV: @Towelliee You need to name a toon "Cubancannon" KEKW
[4:16:11] Jericco8: @Sniped23 well, classic released in august 2019
[4:16:13] Kromede: maw ResidentSleeper

[4:17:08] cudlsac: Thoughts on a WOW 2?
[4:17:16] toobaked1987: YES! ITs their new Classic Andy that changed all this shit.
[4:17:19] Clawharogg: Played the shadowlands beta, wasn't impressed. Haven't bought it.
[4:17:25] Kromede: bobby is not amused
[4:17:25] einself111: it is not classic style gearing  at all
[4:17:34] OutplayPat: @Clawharogg Good Man
[4:17:35] bordibag: "Grind arena so you can have you BiS raid pieces"...
[4:17:41] smashwow: bobby got paid.
[4:17:42] Nilpointnil: inspired by it
[4:17:42] Riggoz1: slower pace he means
[4:17:46] Xirmak: Difference is in classic though the hard work pays off and in retail the hard work simply doesn't pay off.
[4:17:47] edsyw: Doesn't the game director have the final say what goes in the game and what doesn't?
[4:17:51] Phoxzy: It would have been ok IF we had never had "more" loot, but since it was more then less it felt like a slap in the face.
[4:17:52] jacooners: i wish they could make the old raids matter
[4:17:54] Mathhbm: miss the group loot btw
[4:17:58] jeneraljelly: 2
[4:17:59] jacooners: like every patch everything else is useless
[4:18:00] Thills_: 2 to 3
[4:18:01] ododaz: I'm fine with less loot but it would have to be for all forms of content, not just PvE
[4:18:01] jeneraljelly: 2-4
[4:18:02] Vyntage1: 2
[4:18:02] Kinghorn: 2-4
[4:18:03] OGperky: @Towelliee do you think that prot will be a viable leveling alternative in TBC prepatch or is ret the only way to go
[4:18:05] Skaun: 5-6
[4:18:11] ododaz: also masterloot when
[4:18:16] eFBe: 3-4
[4:18:22] kokochris: thats crazy
[4:18:26] Abide13: its more 4 pieces roughly
[4:18:27] smashwow: @ekkex not exactly. there are leaders above them. unfortunately sometimes those decisions are out of the director's hands
[4:18:30] einself111: yeah but now you need to get complete new gear each patch
[4:18:34] jacooners: true but you can run that when naxx is out and there are still good pieces lol
[4:18:34] ododaz: Masterloot when
[4:18:40] brothaxeno: its 2-4
[4:18:41] Holysal: @ododaz never
[4:18:42] kokochris: just give us benthic like system
[4:18:44] chickenwienersoup: better chance winning lottery
[4:18:48] Frank4LuLz: yes we did
[4:18:51] luckfore: a vocal minority wanted it
[4:18:52] Vyntage1: Idk, I'll take less loot over loot blout.
[4:18:52] Frank4LuLz: we wanted it
[4:18:56] Frank4LuLz: lol
[4:19:00] Frank4LuLz: lolllll
[4:19:00] Sielu11628: Crash Bandicoot!
[4:19:03] runnyy: loved the whole guild getting 3x cloaks or 3x rings from bosses :)
[4:19:04] Klauzzer: yeah people wanted it
[4:19:05] Frank4LuLz: lulz
[4:19:10] NinjaGlovz: Exactly. Check the VOD lol
[4:19:13] elandura: @Towelliee I think Normal and Heroic raid should be repeatable content like normal and heroic dungeons, loot-wise, mythic can stay the same.
[4:19:14] eFBe: @Towelliee They saw how popular Classic got, and wanted to make SL that popular. They just didn't understand WHY Classic was popular.
[4:19:16] ododaz: @ododaz BibleThump
[4:19:17] Barba07: I heard a lot of people complaining there's too much loot in the game in general
[4:19:26] Secondbreakfasttt: i killed Sire wiht 4 chars like more then 30 times and looted just 1  items that already got from vault! FEELSGOODMAN!
[4:19:27] metavahn231: i didnt say no TF
[4:19:27] gwar234: the fucking loot system is so broken when PVP gear is good for PVE its shit
[4:19:29] scema12: We wanted loot to have more meaning and value and they thought that meant to remove more loot, that‚Äôs not what anyone wanted lol
[4:19:30] Ranger208: Do you think they lowered the loot  drops from raids to extend 9.0 because they knew 9.1 would take a long time?
[4:19:31] GoodBoy955: i said that :)
[4:19:31] lanara233: Yeah there was way too much loot in BFA
[4:19:32] dozilla: deterministic loot
[4:19:37] KonfusionD: But if there's less loot to get, hence removing the RNG, people would gear out in a week and then complain there's no content
[4:19:38] Mecabeast: we want meaningful loot not less loot
[4:19:39] nintendyoh: THe good old days when you got currency from raiding and could buy gear with it...
[4:19:42] MrKhanes: All i know, ppl wanted to get ridden of titanforge and so on.
[4:19:45] ododaz: Masterloot when man masterloot when
[4:19:50] kokochris: @dozilla exactly
[4:19:52] breadwilton: titanforge getiku with a socket from a loot box was bullshit af
[4:19:57] toobaked1987: When is BFA Classic????
[4:19:57] maccaruso: towOny towOny towOny
[4:19:58] Bigdanny200: TBC release 4 may?
[4:19:59] Klauzzer: yeah homie bring back gdkp with that master loot
[4:20:00] CDubTheRIPper: towOny
[4:20:07] mhgamerkid1337: is that a dog or a fox u have
[4:20:09] smashwow: less gear drops from instanced gameplay was not wanted. what people did want was TF and WF gone along with world quest gearing to go away.
[4:20:09] runnyy: less loot from m+ wasnt too bad though but less raid loot is terrible
[4:20:21] chickenwienersoup: I've heard people say they'd take a gear nerf for easier access to it
[4:20:21] Flatsix_: agreed 100% w/ ur vid towelliee
[4:20:21] Phoxzy: They probably felt that since you no longer have to RNG the same piece of gear until it TF'ed then you shouldn't have as many sources to get it, however that would have been an in house decision not a player choice.
[4:20:21] Phunky_Phan: towOny towHAMUP
[4:20:26] lanara233: Less gear inflation
[4:20:27] Alienfromger: back to the rpg roots. less is more sometimes
[4:20:28] smashwow: less M+ less was 100% terrible
[4:20:29] sorrin143: Titanforged dog treats FTW
[4:20:32] Frank4LuLz: i got to many purps, so #lessloot
[4:20:33] beckett3a: hbo max my guess
[4:20:37] Sollice: Dont confuse less loot with more MEANINGFUL loot
[4:20:41] cudlsac: Do you think theyll ever make a WOW 2?
[4:20:43] smashwow: coupled with the less ilvl too
[4:20:47] Thills_: I went to the movie theater last week my group was the only ones in there lol
[4:20:52] breadwilton: The flipside is now everyone is complaining that they have nothing to do because they have all the loot they want
[4:20:56] Malarick: Black Widow Jul 7 Disney +
[4:21:05] Phunky_Phan: @coloradostrong That must have been cool.
[4:21:05] SonofHorus82: It'll be on HBO max
[4:21:06] Nilpointnil: Rona was the last nail in the coffin
[4:21:23] Phunky_Phan: What did you see @coloradostrong
[4:21:25] ododaz: Masterloot made looting better
[4:21:29] Ordicos: RNG is fine it just was RNG then RNG on top
[4:21:32] mhgamerkid1337: need more loot not less
[4:21:42] UHStorm: less loot + personal loot is horrible
[4:21:51] Thills_: @Phunky_Phan  I saw chaos walking, it was ok at best and there will probably be a second one
[4:21:52] Vyntage1: I think people voiced complaints about loot bloat of meaningless loot.
[4:21:53] zikez: tbc is some heavy grinding in tho xD
[4:22:06] Ranger208: Pretty sure the large theater in my town shut down, it was a Regal.
[4:22:11] menethas1: menethas1 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 20 months! 
[4:22:20] Sollice: What was wrong with BfA loot? Sure we had loot we didn't need. Vendor it for the residium. The residium vendor gave us a chance for a low amount to random a spot, for more amount you got a higher ilevel random slot, or you could spend a larger amount and target SPECIFIC gear. What was wrong with that?
[4:22:23] Clicklesly: I don't really understand what master loot would achieve that personal loot system doesn't?
[4:22:24] Malarick: Me for one I LOVE getting less loot *end sarcasm
[4:22:28] kokochris: we can find a way...
[4:22:34] VillainSR: You are the best wow-streamer Towlie!
[4:22:49] Paramourn: my local theater has taken an even bigger hit since they started checking bags and people for "outside food" whenever you come in
[4:22:50] Klauzzer: bring back titanforging
[4:22:54] odinsdad75: Asmon agreed with Panda and said he was pretty sure the community asked for less loot.
[4:22:58] Alaquane: I thought they stopped selling gametime except for the 2 months
[4:23:00] GetSomeLoGiK: Suicide squad is coming to theaters and hbo max in august
[4:23:02] metavahn231: TF/WF was so good, made low end content relevant
[4:23:12] jeneraljelly: Master Loot is good for Mythic prog guilds but other than that personal is fine imo
[4:23:18] Deathu: I kinda liked the master loot change.
[4:23:20] runnyy: can you delay the 1 year game time until 9.1 or tbc hits? LUL
[4:23:31] Bigdanny200: @Towelliee TBC realease 4 may ?
[4:23:31] jeneraljelly: @Clicklesly it allows you to funnel loot to the player who needs it the most
[4:23:38] breadwilton: @elixirfield1 ya valor points is TF/WF but better because no RNG solves the same problem
[4:23:39] ododaz: @jeneraljelly hard disagree
[4:23:41] Throdio: Part of the community did I'm sure. But it's clear it wasn't the majority
[4:23:45] Magners1996: what game ?
[4:23:47] ticma94: TF was garbage
[4:23:49] iblighters: If TF had a cap it would have been fine
[4:23:52] Deathu: @Bigdanny200 Nah there is no way bro
[4:23:53] ododaz: Masterloot felt so much better even doing heroic
[4:23:59] xrandomdoodx: M+ still felt decently exciting with WF/TF chances in the game
[4:24:03] ododaz: No reason not to have masterloot for guilds
[4:24:04] Clicklesly: How is that different from what's happening with personal loot and splits?
[4:24:06] LazyDynamics: its a problem of personal loot. there is no loot drop that you cant use, which means they have to drastically reduces all loot drops! before personal loot you looted more than 10 drops per dungeon and group and used 0-1. now you only get that 1 drop. @Towelliee
[4:24:11] metavahn231: @Stompsville if only they didnt gate it behind achievs
[4:24:26] jeneraljelly: @Clicklesly you cant funnel loot that has a higher ilvl

[4:24:34] Phunky_Phan: @coloradostrong  I just watched the trailer. looks kinda interesting. Might check it out
[4:24:34] Clawharogg: @Bigdanny200  The prepatch was datamined at May 18th..So that is highly unlikely.
[4:24:37] breadwilton: @elixirfield1 a test of skill is necessary there is no reason someone that cant clear a 15 should get max gear
[4:24:41] Klauzzer: Kappa
[4:24:46] Garrujak: Garrujak subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 80 months! Woo 80 months! Hammers up!
[4:24:49] jeneraljelly: @ododaz yeah I can see that but its less of an issue in heroic raids
[4:24:49] Secondbreakfasttt: my 223 dk weapon still 213 and i'm grinding very hard
[4:24:55] stresstest: People wanted BIS and targeted Loot , This is what they give everyone , now were complaining we want RNG ilvl procs back?
[4:24:59] Speshulist: again, the only redeeming thing to the xbox ad is the blinding lights song LUL.  I tend to not care if there's good music
[4:25:00] ododaz: makes it more unfun :P
[4:25:11] Alaquane: bring back random stats
[4:25:15] Alaquane: I miss green gear
[4:25:15] Rothoss: warforge/titanforge should have been able to upgrade to that level with valor
[4:25:25] smashwow: WF from MOP would have been fine to keep in the game
[4:25:31] breadwilton: @Rothoss thats a cool idea
[4:25:31] Moobot: Check out Towelliee's latest Youtube video! https://youtu.be/U8-64zqVa8k Shadowlands needs some help
[4:25:41] Netratrix: i hope they never put master looter back in game, the community is too toxic for it
[4:25:44] jacooners: they need to introduce things like thunderfury where you have to grind hard to get a really sick weapon
[4:25:45] hyboric: how much crit do ypu have
[4:25:57] EggwithEdges: Warforging was nice, but titanforging was overkill
[4:26:00] Bigdanny200: ok thanks
[4:26:01] BlackMarmalade: There were 2 400~s and the rest were 40s
[4:26:10] Speshulist: there were some 400s
[4:26:10] maalow: I remember when they implanted WF in wod, only +10 ilvl max
[4:26:14] xizidor: We you‚Äôve got 40s everywhere, shit gets crazy
[4:26:15] maalow: It wasn't bad
[4:26:17] Garrujak: to me WF would have been fine, if there was a way to upgrade your gear to it. This way the mythic raiders don't feel like they're getting gipped, and they can always have the best gear
[4:26:21] hyboric: they have chance to double damgae too?
[4:26:22] nintendyoh: >.> Asmongold
[4:26:23] Schnubbers: pretty sure people wanted loot to be meaningful again. I think they wanted to actually know what items they are wearing
[4:26:26] Alaquane: it was all luck
[4:26:27] smashwow: @maalow that was from MOP not WOD
[4:26:28] jeneraljelly: For some people yeah... not everyone got bindings early on
[4:26:29] Vyntage1: TF is not a solo grind
[4:26:34] Arch7: thunderfury is pure rng, not a grind
[4:26:35] rockysimracing: my buddy has been grinding since beginng of classic still doesnt have it
[4:26:39] henrytheprimepr: i dont remember  this quest been this hard to do

[4:26:46] Abide13: most people who got it didn't get it phase 1-3 so it took half a year+ to get it
[4:26:47] jeneraljelly: My buddy farmed his own 100 bars lol dont tell him that wasnt a grind
[4:26:52] AudioJaq: Have had only 1 binding for about a year
[4:26:53] henrytheprimepr: then again i did it as a lock back in the day
[4:26:57] Abide13: and nonmain tanks didnt get their TF funded by the guild
[4:26:57] zikez: get lvl 62 and rep for sporogar shield so sick
[4:27:12] Slafer383: YES it was. It was really long way, I earned.. I farmed 3 months every morning befor ework for arcanite bars x100. I was soo happy to get two parts,and after a year I am still happy. I has been and it a big deal
[4:27:15] Brodih_: id rather a long grind and rng to be honest
[4:27:16] bogv: did you get shadowmourne?
[4:27:19] crabhimself: all I wish there was in wow still is tier sets honestly
[4:27:22] Xirmak: Yes.... a grind is fine when there is a clear cut goal to achieve
[4:27:22] Brodih_: than rng*
[4:27:22] Lamp680: I enjoyed grinding Shadowmourne!
[4:27:43] spainard15: Ateish Staff
[4:27:47] EggwithEdges: Rogue legendary daggers were fun to get heh
[4:27:48] hyboric: ravagers have double damgae chance great hunter pet.... not so great quest mob..
[4:27:52] swordwindgaming: I still think its a tragedy that Shadowmourne looks nowhere near as good as Frostmourne.
[4:27:57] bunnyqt14: finiahed TF on warrior, and waiting for 2nd binding on pally. I can safely say the hardest grind for TF is g
[4:28:00] Vyntage1: I thought they announced bringing back tier sets in later SL patches @crabhimself ?
[4:28:06] trivwik: Good to see you Towelliee. Glad you are feeling better
[4:28:10] bunnyqt14: is looking through trade for xmutes.
[4:28:16] Sahtrak: I did hear from my guild and the pugs I did with in Bfa that the loot felt less rewarding because it was so easy to get in m+. I think blizzard misunderstood that by giving less loot
[4:28:21] Speshulist: @Towelliee so I think that 400 thing you saw was a visual bug.  The 400 and 380 something was just moving left and right all over
[4:28:33] Maruika: those long quests are great too but almost no one gets to experience those personally
[4:28:46] QutipzTV: use ur racial for mana...
[4:28:46] Garrujak: The players are the reason they stopped doing that kind of grind though. How many dicks left the guild that got them shadowmourne or Vala'nyr because they wanted to "upgrade"
[4:28:50] bunnyqt14: Thunderfury is pretty far from a traditional "grind."
[4:28:54] jeneraljelly: @Slafer383 thats dope af dude dont let anyone tell you thats not a grind..
[4:29:02] Kinghorn: he did use it

[4:31:44] dimofodi: Iron Man is even worse, you can only wear like white gear or something like that
[4:31:48] QutipzTV: do you like the layout of these older zones (no distance fog/shadowing + open layout) more than the new ones where you cant see past 100 yards basically
[4:31:56] Abide13: Yeah i got it
[4:32:06] Chibs243: Isn‚Äôt iron man whites and grays only?
[4:32:07] Abide13: There is no change. non greater drums are 8 yard range
[4:32:07] Ranger208: That sounds right.
[4:32:09] empabrempa: blow in to the camera
[4:32:13] Holysal: 40
[4:32:13] Clawharogg: I didn't they really explained it very well.. What they changed.
[4:32:15] Abide13: the big ones come out in ZA and its 40 yards
[4:32:17] BlueBeast33: They still made it mandatory it just cost more mats
[4:32:20] ticma94: lul
[4:32:24] Abide13: so they reduced the range from the green drums
[4:32:25] nintendyoh: I feel attacked
[4:32:25] einself111: People think the "good" drums are raid wide ... but not confirmed
[4:32:26] MetallicusGaming: dimofodi indeed only white and gray gear, no talents, grouping, buffs etc
[4:32:33] Abide13: but effectively you still need leatherworking
[4:32:37] Abide13: so it made no change
[4:33:03] Rujean: Is the drums situation an april fools joke by Blizzard? @Towelliee
[4:33:09] Speshulist: or you use more of them and not stack @Towelliee
[4:33:10] mysteriousm4n: I fucking hope so
[4:33:24] Ranger208: it sounds like a nerf to ranged dps
[4:33:29] donpablo_98: cheer200 towCheer100
[4:33:32] kimmo_gaming: i@
[4:33:37] Congelatore: @Towelliee The stack requirement makes using drums on most fights in Sunwell impossible since there is so much AOE damage (Kalec, Brut, M'uru, KJ)
[4:33:53] Weemancod: then again, what does the internet ever take well
[4:33:54] kimmo_gaming: @Towelliee You can only arcane torrent mobs that have mana as a resource, simple as that
[4:34:01] donpablo_98: yeaa it did
[4:34:03] Weemancod: buncha babies
[4:34:05] Speshulist: @Congelatore just have to use more.  which is fine too
[4:34:06] Felrane: so you need 20 LW for phase 1-3 then only 4 for phase 4. Seems good
[4:34:09] SonofHorus82: My understanding was that they HAD to be used by leatherworkers, but they took that off so that anyone can use them. Was that right or am I crazy?
[4:34:10] donpablo_98: towBleedpurple towBleedpurple
[4:34:16] Tirantus17: that and there dumb sub money grab
[4:34:22] Garrujak: Imagine caring about drums in Sunwell which we prolly won't even be in for a year or two
[4:34:25] saunan: Do you want fresh tbc servers?
[4:34:30] Alaquane: I thought they didn't have currency in star trek
[4:34:32] Frank4LuLz: gold pressed latnum
[4:34:35] StraightErro: lat-i-num
[4:34:41] Durras2000: Latnum, Glod Pressed Latnum is the currency
[4:34:45] Holysal: trekkies are real nerds
[4:34:48] Durras2000: gold
[4:34:54] Jenoseph: fyi it is gold pressed latinum
[4:35:00] Congelatore: @Speshulist Use more hose? On Kalec (top), Brut, and KJ you cannot stack for more than a few seconds at most or it's almost an insta wipe.

[4:39:53] seanb4games: Everyones gonna go ham on the new races in prepatch
[4:39:53] huntsey1995: I love the way Shadowlands is 10x more than feeling forced into an infinite grind personally.
[4:39:54] Mecabeast: im leveling my 7th 60 for guilds alt night
[4:39:56] Speshulist: @minidanny that's a never with Blizzard
[4:39:57] Utmost777: I dont have a guild so even stuff related to player power feels pointless because I don't raid and LFR gear is so low compared to other loot
[4:39:57] Farfic: @minidanny no wiped

[4:41:07] redeemed_07: @towelliee Are you playing Horde when BC classic releases?
[4:41:11] Speshulist: I remember that was one of the things I loved about Classic.  Mob patting patterns were all over.  One group circled around an entire area and sets of mobs patted on top of each other
[4:41:12] gabbledabbler89: @torjix I think you can only boost a human pally not a BE

[4:43:17] tdpark_: pikaOMG
[4:43:17] Vormim: counter bots Kappa
[4:43:18] Abide13: I think most would rather have that then bots tbh
[4:43:19] ClassicMalcontent: But it won't counter bots. Only actually going after bot accounts will do so.
[4:43:19] silodin: i have not the time to make gold but plenty of real money
[4:43:20] jeneraljelly: its better than people buying gold from bots imo
[4:43:25] ClassicMalcontent: There are bots on Retail
[4:43:26] Kisswani: pikaOMG
[4:43:26] NickLeonhearth: pika pika motherfucker
[4:43:27] sliizew: they will add it, but it's not gonna make any difference LUL
[4:43:30] SteveSD: "counter" bots....... look at retail it doesnt counter anything
[4:43:32] fistofnature: pikaOMG
[4:43:34] jmr2015: it needs it
[4:43:37] FistoTheFistybot: WoW token doesnt counter bots though
[4:43:39] Tirantus17: yeah 100 percent
[4:43:40] jeneraljelly: it allows people to legally buy gold though

[4:43:43] Ishva: hahaha
[4:43:44] Greybeard_ttv: who cares just play the game lol
[4:43:44] jeneraljelly: wow is basically pay to win in 2021
[4:43:47] dimofodi: IDK, maybe it's just me, but paying Blizz money for a token instead of paying a bot doesn't sound like a solution to bots. It sounds like them using bots to their advantage.
[4:43:47] Farfic: I just hate farming gold on my classic holy priest.. give me dual spec :D
[4:43:49] ClassicMalcontent: @SteveSD exactly bots are in Retail as well
[4:43:56] TheUnknowing: im fine with classic tokens
[4:44:06] Maldinger_der_Edellurker: i heard in chinese classic wow there are wow tokens already
[4:44:09] Clawharogg: @Farfic  Classic Wrath you'll get it LUL
[4:44:17] SteveSD: @ClassicMalcontent  yup, token dont do squat, blizz just are just the gold sellers now lol
[4:44:21] drizztd00rden: retail gold LULW
[4:44:25] vinterblod80: Is it confirmed that there will be a TBC store mount?
[4:44:27] DMordak: I've been farming gold non stop in preperation.
[4:44:35] jeneraljelly: Retail gold is free basically lol classic gold harder to come by for sure
[4:44:36] NotTakenJack: who cares for wow tokens or mounts just play the game and enjoy it its a Mmorpg
[4:44:45] Qylin_Tiaras: to the EU classic players here, any recommendations on which server i should start leveling? Im originally german, but dont mind raiding with english folks aswell
[4:44:53] Brodih_: a wow token is the same price as a month subscription ?
[4:45:01] NotTakenJack: @Qhaz_ no
[4:45:06] Felrane: classic gold is like 50$ for 1000g right now
[4:45:07] Holysal: @Qhaz_ $20
[4:45:10] Spaede: Hey I‚Äôll be buying my tokens on retail for blizz balance for that sweet sweet 58 boost
[4:45:13] Lamp680: They splinter as you kill them
[4:45:17] drizztd00rden: @Qylin_Tiaras never come to twisting nether full of turks
[4:45:19] spamsheepwow: @Towelliee How far do you think they'll go with the "classic" relaunches? Do we make it to Cata? MoP?
[4:45:22] ClassicMalcontent: @vinterblod80 supposedly a "TBC Ultimate" or some type of premium TBC but essentially it seems so. They are trying to make something like a Digital Collector's Edition of TBC Classic which includes the mount.
[4:45:33] Kisswani: if there's one thing that might prevent me from playing TBC is hellfire . I hate this zone . I LOVE Blade Edge tho
[4:45:33] fistofnature: @IronmanKKona KKona

[4:46:14] NickLeonhearth: In 2007 there was a collectors edition pet btw, every1 forgetting that?
[4:46:15] drizztd00rden: @Qylin_Tiaras method is there tho
[4:46:16] visi1761: can't remember what it is though
[4:46:22] Klauzzer: collector's shits always been a thing tho
[4:46:22] OpexKoru: ikr KEKW
[4:46:28] Tirantus17: wish they would make a heroic version for raid and have the mount drop off a boss
[4:46:29] Senaries: these no changes classic andies are over reacting
[4:46:36] ChiefMango: the CE is 100% gonna be for retail if you buy TBC CE.. my thoughts at least
[4:46:42] spamsheepwow: @Towelliee How far do you think they'll go with the "classic" relaunches? Do we make it to Cata? MoP?
[4:46:47] Wildside1177: How dare they add a meaningless cosmetic!!
[4:46:47] Ranger208: yes
[4:46:49] drizztd00rden: @Qylin_Tiaras and echo in tarre mill
[4:46:52] ClassicMalcontent: I don't mind a Digital Collector's Edition for TBC Classic but that's all.
[4:46:52] Biotechz: Crocolisk in the city fishing daily when?

[4:47:11] Shugaze: they use buzzwords like pandora box and slippery slope way too much
[4:47:14] OpexKoru: tbh i don't think classic andy's really know what they want. Everyone seems to want something different
[4:47:18] Greybeard_ttv: Classic 1%er's are way worse than retail ones for sure and it's so annoying lol
[4:47:18] Kisswani: " but muh ingame effort "
[4:47:21] ElRemmos: i mean, you have a 2k usd tiger mount on TBC
[4:47:21] Garrujak: but Towelliee NO CHANGES.......except changes that make me more of an elitist neckbeard damnit
[4:47:42] MysticalOS: the complaint i heard is that the new mount is higher rez (modern polygons) over every mount in tbc, so the only way to get a better looking textured mount is pay.
[4:47:43] EddyyBear: Minidiablo was a pet in the original WoW Collector's Edition.
[4:47:44] lekkahdh: why would you kill em?

[4:48:00] GoodBoy955: FeelsAmazingMan
[4:48:04] Arizonaer: MMM Baconnnnnnnn
[4:48:07] MysticalOS: that the way to fix it is to make it look crappier, like rest of tbc mounts
[4:48:15] OpexKoru: POGGERS bacon
[4:48:34] Omajjin: damn cat
[4:48:55] shocktorrent: @chat is one button hunter going to be a thing, or did they remove/change that macros function
[4:49:06] Kisswani: feign death POGGERS
[4:49:11] ClassicMalcontent: Collector's Edition items are all well and good. Everything else is perfectly outlined in the "The Ballad of the Level Boost" | By MadSeasonShow on YouTube.

[4:53:24] TMMOOF: lol
[4:53:25] silodin: cata was dope
[4:53:26] Felrane: id like the pvp
[4:53:28] General_SushiBuns: one thing ill never miss is that error speech
[4:53:31] einself111: they would rather do classic mop
[4:53:31] spamsheepwow: I surely hope not. I did like MoP though.
[4:53:32] egraves7: i'd love to hear the audience laughter if they announced that
[4:53:33] ClassicMalcontent: "Classic Cata" is called current Retail basically
[4:53:36] MuttonChopins: what about MoP classi
[4:53:37] Speshulist: bfa classic.  get your azerite armor again!
[4:53:38] Shugaze: classic cata wouldnt make sense cus the classic zones are changed
[4:53:43] cowthulhu1: skip cata mop and wod. Bring legion!
[4:53:45] Felrane: We should just all die at the end of Wrath by the LK and we could do classic+
[4:53:46] Maldinger_der_Edellurker: cata pre nerf 5 man dungeons was good
[4:53:53] TMMOOF: when talents changed
[4:53:53] chickenwienersoup: Nirvana is classic rock now
[4:53:55] lanara233: Classic + after Wrath if the sub numbers are healthy enough
[4:54:06] Nilpointnil: definitely with the destruction of the old world
[4:54:11] MysticalOS: honestly I think too many misremember cataclysm. patch 4.0 and 4.1 were really good. 4.2 and 4.3 were dogshit. launch dungeons, raids, and firelands and molten front. that's good shit
[4:54:11] Puppette: the DS content drought was really rough
[4:54:11] TMMOOF: ^^
[4:54:16] Klauzzer: classic bfa poggers
[4:54:19] MysticalOS: ZA and ZG and dragonsoul, no
[4:54:34] ClassicMalcontent: I wanted to fly over the original world not the cata world. Or not have flying old world. New Cata zones? They were nice. Completely reworking the old world, nah. That's why I came to Classic to see the original zones.
[4:54:35] silodin: SoO was worse
[4:54:39] TheUnknowing: id say wrath definitely would feel 'classic' to me, but cata onward no
[4:54:42] NickLeonhearth: SoO was 14 months
[4:54:44] Arizonaer: Classic Mrs Pacman is next?
[4:54:45] ChiefMango: Yet!
[4:54:47] Felrane: Well of eternity was pretty good
[4:54:47] SilkeySmooth: @Towelliee blizzard doesnt have to follow the expansion orfer they can do a classic mop then a classic legion.
[4:54:54] SilkeySmooth: irder
[4:54:54] vinterblod80: Wrath was the real end of Wow. It is a trilogi like lord of The rings
[4:54:56] Hefad: I think you can call classic till LK, after it is not classic anymore Imho
[4:55:00] maccaruso: I thought the longest drought was ICC
[4:55:05] jeneraljelly: already??
[4:55:07] jeneraljelly: wow thats so bad
[4:55:07] ClassicMalcontent: @TheUnknowing  same. Wrath still had classic zones in tact.
[4:55:10] Shugaze: wow 1 year lol
[4:55:11] Kromede: FeelsBadMan
[4:55:12] mytherel: SOO was a pretty long farm period too

[4:55:29] NubishDelth: Saw people on classic hate on you for tbc beta. You are hilarious.
[4:55:29] metavahn231: wrath is more retail than retail, people just have strong nostalgia for it
[4:55:30] Flatsix_: maybe even later according to BC release unless it's sync'd
[4:55:32] sifoo01: I heard the phrase "friends and family " 50 times last stream :)
[4:55:37] lekkahdh: What about SoO draught? LUL LUL LUL
[4:55:39] Wulfgrym: august is optimistic

[4:56:08] Klauzzer: classic andys LUL
[4:56:10] cowthulhu1: Not like there is a global pandemic or anything
[4:56:14] ClassicMalcontent: @elixirfield1 it's not about the systems it's about the original game world; for me. I levelled in Vanilla and TBC and I hate the redo old zones in Cata personally. But that's me; and others I know.
[4:56:17] MuttonChopins: classicwow reddit literally was pro 50 boost then after madseason video came out everyone is against it now

[4:59:16] generalmarcus35: lol. Green eggs and ham
[4:59:29] elnipoo: the whole online world is actually toxic :(
[4:59:52] jeneraljelly: @nipoow yup, people try and blame certain groups but its just toxicity as far as the eye can see
[4:59:58] Felrane: social media was a mistake
[5:00:08] chickenwienersoup: MoP was 13 years ago
[5:00:16] sifoo01: Blizz gonna stop at Wrath Classic I think
[5:00:20] Felrane: id love MoP
[5:00:22] x_GROUCHNA_x: You're a really good guy @Towelliee. I can't beleive people dosen't like you.
[5:00:31] Maldinger_der_Edellurker: classic shadowland Kappa
[5:00:32] Doomzl: Why no cata?
[5:00:37] Holysal: Mop for farming sim
[5:00:38] Curtsy: @poocifer_ MoP was late 2012 my dude
[5:00:38] xvstormvx: @Towelliee lmao they gonna make you do cata..
[5:00:38] dimofodi: They could do a Cata/MoP classic together since it's 10 levels
[5:00:43] miloryeah: no need cata for sure
[5:00:46] Nitemareforu: That's some 5 head shit right there
[5:00:47] NubishDelth: After wrath they should just do wow2
[5:00:48] OssewTV: how would u get from 80-85 ?
[5:00:49] sprert: with the right changes cata classic can be nice. cata wasn't that bad
[5:00:50] chickenwienersoup: I loved catagasm
[5:00:50] NickLeonhearth: I had a good time in Cata
[5:00:50] elnipoo: when the social media came me out, it was the worst, then it started on videogames. dont know why people like to be toxic online.
[5:00:52] Baldarsar: the should stop at Lich King classic !!!
[5:00:53] Garrujak: I mean no one gonna ask for WoD classic xD
[5:00:54] Felrane: perhaps fix the cata problems?
[5:00:55] sprert: only the end sucked
[5:00:56] Kisswani: KRKE
[5:00:56] sifoo01: they gonna go to WOTLK and then just release Fresh servers
[5:00:56] ArcaneMaki: I loved Cata
[5:00:57] bogv: i just want to play wotlk
[5:00:57] MrEvilRex: Hey Towelliee ur eggs seem to have a lot of volume to them, are they just a lot of eggs or are you do something special to them while cooking?
[5:00:58] Kisswani: KEKW
[5:00:59] Speshulist: D:
[5:00:59] MuttonChopins: just let people vote for next classic after Wrath
[5:00:59] MrKhanes: True @dimofodi that could be cool
[5:01:02] BlueBeast33: I honestly wouldn't play anything past Wrath
[5:01:02] miloryeah: but mop meh also
[5:01:07] Clicklesly: But then also do they change the level caps or what?
[5:01:10] DaveTBT: i kind of agree that wow2 should be the next step
[5:01:11] Kysnar: THey should keep the old world as it is in Classic
[5:01:11] einself111: i think they rather do classic + after wrath
[5:01:12] Quimby54: @Garrujak id take wod classic if they finished the xpack instead of ditching it
[5:01:12] Felrane: firelands Cata was pretty fun but Dragonsoul patch wasn't at all
[5:01:15] onyx_pupper: or take a page out of runescape and add seperate stuff
[5:01:21] giggity360: Just figure out the tech for mega servers and release one for each version and let people play whatever they wanna play i think lol
[5:01:22] Curtsy: @Garrujak WoD private servers existed during WoD, there will 100% be people who want WoD classic
[5:01:30] ÁÑ°ËÅ∑ÊèêÁù£: lol
[5:01:32] laame: Classic should stop at Wrath.
[5:01:34] spamsheepwow: Fury warriors pre-nerf at the start of Cata were so fun lmao. That's like the only thing I'd like to do. That, and having TW in arena as a fire mage.
[5:01:36] GraaMee: tbh I would like to see wod with the 3rd tier added
[5:01:38] MrKhanes: Maybe wow wod classic as it was intended?
[5:01:38] Felrane: Pretty much Wrath
[5:01:39] Griffo525: Wrath
[5:01:41] PawgersHC: grittz6690 subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 3 months, currently on a 2 month streak! 
[5:01:42] Holysal: wrath should be the last one
[5:01:44] Alegnowar: i hope they just stop at wrath
[5:01:44] sprert: give us WoD classic with the cut content
[5:01:44] Greybeard_ttv: Stop at Wrath plz
[5:01:45] Glozki: legacy
[5:01:47] ZIKERZ: stll no beta invite oh well
[5:01:47] MuttonChopins: WoD had pretty good raids
[5:01:48] DMordak: I never got to try MoP, but hear classes were great then.
[5:01:48] swordwindgaming: Draenor completed as intended might be great, though.
[5:01:50] Garrujak: classic needs to stop at Wrath imo though
[5:01:50] Darkgx5: @towelliee ate they going to re release all the expacks?
[5:01:51] Ranger208: There are parts of Cata I loved and parts that I hated. Not sure if they should go there tho.
[5:01:51] Wulfgrym: progression servers
[5:01:52] TMMOOF: Remastered Servers LUL
[5:01:53] OssewTV: relaunched
[5:01:53] ArcaneMaki: REFORGED
[5:01:54] lanara233: wrath should be the last one, then C+
[5:01:56] ChiefMango: Reforged!
[5:01:56] einself111: Classic + after Wrath
[5:02:00] Snaxsalot: @Towelliee I do miss a good hardroll and black and white cookies... Found a decent NY deli here in SoCal. Good subs
[5:02:01] chickenwienersoup: I'd say stop before Wraith
[5:02:05] SonofHorus82: WoD as intended could be pretty tight.
[5:02:06] Kisswani: 60+ Star trek downloads already POGGERS
[5:02:06] DaveTBT: wrath was the last good exp
[5:02:08] MysticalOS: i'd want to see mist servers
[5:02:10] spamsheepwow: LMAO

[5:02:20] Wulfgrym: progression servers, start at vanilla and go up each expac every 3-4 months
[5:02:21] NovaSun84: LULW
[5:02:24] shale93: WoD reforged thats a good name Kappa
[5:02:24] bogv: wrath and legion were the best expansions
[5:02:25] DreamIV: Lmao
[5:02:26] MysticalOS: mists is my favorite expansion and that's true for a lot of people, even max agrees with that
[5:02:33] Felrane: I think they should re-master classic. Give it retail graphics and then they could use that work to update retail zones
[5:02:33] Flatsix_: they're not going to divide the player base even more with like 4 bad xpac servers
[5:02:34] jmr2015: WoW2 after wrath classic
[5:02:41] MrEvilRex: Surely "Classic" is just any xpac that is 15 years old or more? so it changes year by year
[5:02:46] DaveTBT: cata should have never been made, mop was ok, wod was terrible, legion was boring, bfa was hot garbage, and shawdowlands is the same old stuff
[5:02:51] ZIKERZ: pallidan tanks  are the best aoe tanks i tbc
[5:02:53] Nitemareforu: What they could to. is release Cata, But make is so you can go back to the Classic Azeroth in like the Caverns of time

[5:03:15] Nitemareforu: But I'm not play Classic past WoTLK
[5:03:16] Curtsy: @MrEvilRex Read what you said again, there is no expansion fifteen years old
[5:03:24] DaveTBT: DaveTBT subscribed with Prime. 
[5:03:26] GoodBoy955: =/
[5:03:27] CDubTheRIPper: LUL
[5:03:28] chickenwienersoup: and even if they suck you still come back for each xpac so why would they change
[5:03:29] Sollice: grow some of those taters
[5:03:41] sprert: friggin druids planting shards all over the place
[5:03:43] maccaruso: Matt Damon made it work

[5:04:17] ArcaneSyntax: no rightous fury btw @towelliee
[5:04:21] PapaHamster66: What they need to do is at some point change the timeline and do a completely new game HYPERS
[5:05:01] DaveTBT: would be nice if they just picked up the story from wrath and just scrap the rest
[5:05:06] chickenwienersoup: or give us wow 2 with new plots and characters
[5:05:08] DaveTBT: people would be mad but it would be a better game i think
[5:05:08] ArcaneMaki: Sim it
[5:05:11] dwolters_the_zombieman: @Towelliee hi and hi chat
[5:05:13] dimofodi: agreed, sim it
[5:05:21] Speshulist: @Towelliee why they keep giving me ads about vaping LUL
[5:06:21] ofnaldreya: He agreed with the majority of it, but did think that BFA was worse
[5:06:33] toobaked1987: He did say SL is better than BFA
[5:06:41] chickenwienersoup: drama debby's should stop
[5:06:41] denflup: BFA was way worse
[5:06:42] neverbornlucky: Towelliee if WarLords of Draenor and Shadowlands had a baby what would their baby be like ?

[5:07:12] einself111: He likes pvp that is why he likes SL
[5:07:18] Holysal: he likes that there is no ap grind
[5:07:18] Flatsix_: i'm pumped for the TBC prot pally rivendare's deathcharger grind
[5:07:39] chickenwienersoup: bfa terrain was trash before flying
[5:07:56] denflup: its gonna be meh lets be real
[5:07:58] ofnaldreya: It comes down to his dislike the endless grind in regard to player power whereas you enjoy that kind of content
[5:07:59] gwar234: i sure hope so

[5:08:35] einself111: @Towelliee asmon likes pvp in SL he does not raid or m+ tho
[5:08:37] Felrane: attunements?
[5:08:37] maccaruso: I think we need to settle into the fact that Shadowlands is going to be WoD 2.0.  An expansion which fails to live up to it's potential
[5:08:39] Kinghorn: andyShrug
[5:08:43] ArcaneMaki: It is so different for everyone, and to where everyone was in their life (school, career, family, etc). Wrath was the best for me.
[5:08:56] BraerHZ: @Maccaruso agree
[5:09:01] Odasnookums: when you start the sporebat eyes quest, start a timer.  lol
