[0:36:41] YoMz: @javus0234 well yeah that's always the case, but saying "everyone is building the same thing" is generally wrong, because there are a bunch of builds that get tested by so many people before they get copied

[7:37:59] SnowballEOD: remember, even as scuffed as Classic looks, people used to ERP in Goldshire with their Nelfs. Don't get me started on Horde, those damn Furries

[7:38:16] SnowballEOD: @DuKeIt0uT KEK
[7:38:18] kross_88: compared to diablo and poe WoW looks pretty dated now
[7:38:21] xpentakill: chat i have one very dumb question. from what i have read the tanks maintain aggro by doing the most dmg to the boss. if someone does more dmg the mob re-aggros on that person. So if tanks do the most dmg why do we have other roles like hunter? hunter can never do more dmg than the tank right.
[7:38:26] heyitsMart: @w0mbii start with whichever world looks better to you, they're pretty different
[7:38:36] Snith: Without revealing too much, has sing looked up clipping at all?
[7:38:47] DuKeIt0uT: @xpentakill, but warrior's skills generate more threat, so it isn't just about doing more damage
[7:38:50] Christmas_Fighters: iHeckinLovePuns coom will only bring more coom smhmyhead
[7:38:51] Ouglaaa: xpentakill they do more THREAT than dmg
[7:38:51] deranked: @xpentakill prolly for class based spells and also preferences
[7:38:53] bussakos: why would you compare an mmo to some arps is the real question LUL
[7:38:54] DrSpookenstein: @xpentakill because classic has a lot of shit mechanics that werent fleshed out until TBC
[7:38:57] saintorsinnerz: @xpentakill dps can easily out dps and getting threat if they are not careful

[7:39:15] dolkilu: wait it was Gunznrocketz
[7:39:16] SnowballEOD: @xpentakill Distance from boss affects aggro generation as well, so melee damage is "stronger" aggro than ranged. Tanks also usually have mechanics to increase threat generation, like Warriors using Sunder Armor. Good classes also have a taunt to pull aggro to themselves if needed.
[7:39:27] heyitsMart: @w0mbii sounds good okey you are now singAYAYA
[7:39:31] xpentakill: thanks chat.
[7:39:40] Zivveria: @miloenjoyer_ True and spamming notice when not doing anything Classic. Honestly it was a good MMO with nice concept

[7:39:44] dolkilu: @deranked you Lussypicker? GoodMeme

[7:41:56] SnowballEOD: @xpentakill No, but funnily enough, casting heals generates threat. So if a healer stands too close to the tank and spams heals, the boss can decide to attack the healer.

[7:42:28] DuKeIt0uT: @SnowballEOD, Don't forget buffing in combat causes insane threat. That's a Paladin trick is to buff Kings on everyone to do threat

[10:22:43] Urager: ceolinrob does classic have that much endgame content?
[10:23:13] Urager: so its really just about the journey
[10:23:15] jensen_12: @Urager quite a bit, yea
[10:23:16] crisbylettuce: Urager, aq20, aq40, mc, zg, naxx, bwl, a fair bit of content

[10:23:26] DrunkLoliOgre: TBC has a load of elites patrolling the world which will just run up and shank you
[10:23:32] ceolinrob: @Urager plenty, yeah. but it's also really easy, so a commited group will clear endgame in a month
[10:23:33] Joxedin: it's good exp as well
[10:23:33] deranked: @Urager certainly a fun journey ngl
[10:23:44] Kobasiburek: @RaRasputin ye
[10:24:08] fiq_ir90: Time to scroll the death log. KEK
[10:24:10] forty_0: i once did sfk solo that took forever to do all bosses
[10:24:13] Ramza123: Ramza123 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 11 months, currently on a 7 month streak! 
[10:24:20] Urager: i guess thats fair, im just trying to see where this leads. Both runescape and now wow have show that ppl just eat up these challenge modes
[10:24:30] xGhastlyx: Will you make a new character if you die ?
[10:24:30] anarkay: u don't even need a tank in classic till 40+ lol

[10:25:03] Hjolt: i mean guys, tbc hardcore would still be fun. theres lots of lava, fel reavers, and other random elites
[10:25:05] Joxedin: seems like there's a lot not showing up, judging by the number of 15+ on that list
[10:25:09] ceolinrob: @Urager oh definitely, those 1% guys cleared hardcore really quickly and really easily, but for the average gamer its a nice journey
[10:25:15] Kobasiburek: Hardcore is basically for ppl who have played before and know what they're doing. But vanilla is just such a good RPG chill experience with player interaction, it's so good

[10:25:53] crisbylettuce: jokertard, spreading plague in orgrimmar was Okayeg

[10:26:18] vapo213: @singsing i died like that alot in classic non hc
[10:26:19] ihssoy: Not really? @Kobasiburek The biggest concern of playing hardcore is watching your surroundings
[10:26:21] ReyusX: @esparsit i really disliked tbc
[10:26:23] mrrhino571: my first wow experince was WoW classiclike 4 yrs ago
[10:26:30] RinD41: someone die soo we can test the deathalert KEK

[10:27:07] hadid08: thanks
[10:27:08] ihssoy: oh, no, they are not. Dungeons are for items
[10:27:12] Captain_Rax: its only worth it if you reallly need the gear
[10:27:13] DuKeIt0uT: Yeah but you don't get a lot of gear upgrades that way
[10:27:14] Lolieasy: Definitely
[10:27:14] Altoid_: Got griefed hrad
[10:27:14] tantalim: but is it more fun?
[10:27:16] Joxedin: might be, but dungeons are fun
[10:27:17] Altoid_: *hard
[10:27:21] xGhastlyx: faster but boring
[10:27:24] mrrhino571: thats how most of the streamers are doing it, but they have mob tagers with them
[10:27:24] nulladdict: Lore
[10:27:26] esparsit: @ReyusX yea, vanilla is the best lvling by a long shot
[10:27:28] mostlylaughing: dungeons are better gameplay wise
[10:27:30] andima88: The real life experience is worth peepoGlad
[10:27:30] Hjolt: not as a hunter but as a mage perhaps, also you'd fall off on gear, i think anyway
[10:27:31] Nirgil: Well Stockade specifically doesn't even drop gear
[10:27:33] Kobasiburek: @ihssoy I mean I guess there are casuals going into this too, we've seen a bunch of <lvl15 deaths KEK
[10:27:38] DrunkLoliOgre: it's mainly about the items and quests the first time
[10:27:41] ReyusX: wasnt chaining dungeons the fastest way to lvl? thats how people used to do it afaik
[10:27:48] pux3: stormwind always been this foggy?
[10:27:50] Sandap: !roll
[10:27:50] Skwishi: Sandap has rolled a 14
[10:27:58] deranked: @ReyusX but we aint here to level.. we here to chill :)
[10:28:05] ihssoy: Dying at 1-20 is way easier than 20+. Then there's 60 raids @Kobasiburek
[10:28:05] yusba: Maybe faster but imo for stream its more fun if you do dungeons too, and its not a speedrun to 60 anyway
[10:28:13] jaymistark: you can only do one dungeon a day if you are under 60
[10:28:15] MatscherPlatscher: mount at 40 how *broke*
[10:28:15] jokertard: jesus that nymn clip
[10:28:16] jokertard: he's mad
[10:28:22] dont_google_dqw4w9wgxcq: even if xp gain is not good, changing your gear is worth it alone, especially in hc mode
[10:28:23] crisbylettuce: jokertard, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC9c6D0B-JM PepeLaf
[10:28:23] ReyusX: @ReyusX But Sing was talking about efficiency himself
[10:28:25] jaymistark: (i mean go into the same dungeon only once)
[10:28:38] boxbrosg: One slows, one freezes in place
[10:28:40] chickychubs: one slows in an area other cc stun
[10:28:40] noidburger: frost is like a big area of slow, freezing is 1 target cc
[10:28:40] zeast66: elnosabe
[10:28:42] esparsit: Frozen trap okey
[10:28:43] forty_0: i feel like the first 20 levels of wow are very streamlined and after that you don't really know where to go next singsingT
[10:28:48] mrrhino571: @jaymistark i tought it was you can do a paticular dungeon only one a day
[10:28:48] ihssoy: one creates a slowing ground effect, other one incaps an enemy
[10:28:49] Trashcan_Player: frost trap is aoe slow. freezing trap is single target incap
[10:28:50] kevplusyeti: one is aoe slow
[10:28:50] forty_0: if you are new that is
[10:28:52] Nirgil: the new one is for kiting

[12:36:39] Tink10: Done duskwood levelling? some good quests there, but a lil dangerous.
[12:36:41] Volcanotron: @KazakiTV needing a guide KEK
