[0:07:57] HouseOnFire: after first i was searching for ways to nudge you through DMs cuz the move was certainly not locked in
[0:07:57] thisisthotcaller: @soberday123 can you explain why you would say that?

[0:08:20] uncannysword: You guys seriously need to just keep this private, respectfully
[0:08:26] snozeberriess: can you open your talents rq?
[0:08:26] Minimove: are the teams allowed to have only 3 members or are 4 a must?
[0:08:32] Johnykarate: ion if anyone thought that but thats crazy and not even alot of money?
[0:08:33] wode406: no one is saying that as far as i know
[0:08:37] amtrash112: peevpee

[0:08:59] Rhavione: @lucki_val beans has an explanation about the situation already there's nothing about the money or something.
[0:09:05] lycansong: cant keep it private it now chatters are going wild with speculation
[0:09:09] turd_master_69: @Pikabooirl so u looking for a 4th? im a DH with 3 keybinds and i do lots of dmg

[0:09:55] Lehhride: Jelly literally came back and said nobody harass you guys and question anything and then everyone goes and does exactly what jelly said not to do lol
[0:10:01] wode406: @imyoungdraco i believe this part. Jelly was also mostly talking about Carl and Wiz in his stream
[0:10:09] brkyuqi: im not a real mod i cant do that
[0:10:17] Voriq: I'm fucking edging rn bro
[0:10:18] Bigshet21: Choo Chooo PrideFloat

[0:10:52] Lurn: NPBeharry i can prob do that
[0:10:58] NPBeharry: I don’t blame him @lurn
[0:11:00] locked29: sounds like it was absterges call
[0:11:01] stone12033: dam we got ad cucked during the explanation
[0:11:06] praisedtwitch: whats the point in "playing the tourny without him" if he probably wasnt going to get much play time anyway
[0:11:07] Blitzylive: why didn't you talk to Jelly before agreeing with others?
[0:11:11] slaynd: have you seen his vid?
[0:11:12] jackiethereindeer: @lurn are you still with j9
[0:11:14] kzeelol: so u kick someone from the team but its not a big deal
[0:11:15] endtrip_: he took it as a forever personal thing lol
[0:11:22] saveslol: the difference in perspectives of this is insane
[0:11:24] ajdowers: wtf i thought I was subbed but got a commercial idk how this shit works lmao

[0:11:31] jmaz_27: @Pikabooirl Yo i dont wanna sound rude but i dont wanna listen to all the drama, it should be kept between friends. people are so toxic and love this shit
[0:11:36] bobbybigbuxx: yikes man, i watched the entire jelly video, yikes.
[0:11:36] Voriq: All good just vibe, I'm getting BLACKED rn

[0:11:48] chrisiirc: @jmaz_27 leave and shut up
[0:11:48] Minimove: You should still send jelly a private message and just ask if hes doing okey. he could be depressed or something, not good to be alone during those times, if that's the case
[0:11:50] xaviorn7575: idk bad timing
[0:11:51] stone12033: @pinetreesz do they make one for iOS
[0:11:54] glennsplendid: You don't really need to explain shit to chat honestly. It's your guys' stuff. Feelin' good for tomorrow?
[0:11:57] Zyphur7: TIME FOR XARYU TO UNRETIRE
[0:11:58] ahoyia: it’s all good brother. head down to win tomorrows tourney! you guys got this
[0:11:59] NPBeharry: Ty!!! @lurn
[0:12:03] slyphex: @Hampstain xD
[0:12:03] 777delayed: they are very calm and collected
[0:12:08] pure__goat: Did you see his broadcast today? little short 30 stream he did. With him just venting
[0:12:08] imagamerbby: You should talk to vince man. It literally doesn't matter what anyone says - you should make sure your friend is okay. fuck wow, fuck the team, thats a friend in a rough fucking time.
[0:12:16] Nvellen: honestly, all details aside, things live grow and die. Ya'll were longest lasting team too. things happen, things change, nature of things. its all good
[0:12:16] PineTreesz: @Zyphur7 I would love to see xaryu on the team
[0:12:19] 2morebeers: ya they put up with your bs all the time...xD
[0:12:20] spoikkii: You should send him atleast a message on your behalf since it feels like your not so included in this like carl and wiz @Pikabooirl
[0:12:22] 00ZZEE: The timing of the kick is very weird tbh, especially if its been a thing for 6+ years like absterge said
[0:12:22] DodjyQ: will you be changing the sub alert?
[0:12:25] Jathela: Jathela subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 13 months, currently on a 6 month streak! Hope everything is all good dude. Good luck this weekend
[0:12:29] hcrzealot: @Nvellen /salute
[0:12:33] MisterThatDude: I've seen Sterge play shuffle, he has the tolerance of a god
[0:12:44] HouseOnFire: @Zyphur7 Major W
[0:12:50] hcrzealot: @Nvellen You've always been a real one.  I always like seeing you in the stream
[0:12:50] peeachy8: I blame Blizzard
[0:12:59] xenotv: what that means is that theres underlying personal issues
[0:12:59] zatrian7: xar doesnt even play wow retail guys LUL
[0:13:01] dalagon250: ugh arrived late, what happened chat
[0:13:01] figurines: Music off it doesn't fit the vibe right now
[0:13:02] shad3dspectr3: yea, this ain't the end, you guys are too young, it'll all work out brother
[0:13:04] xenotv: surfacing
[0:13:08] Steff_988: i can say with confidence that carl has enough emotion that this is tough on him, and its not selfish. ignore chat and lets talk about the games, you guys will figure this out, and true supports will see the move preserve!
[0:13:10] Jaybeezy: IM WITH U PIKA <3
[0:13:11] drumminbacon: Bro, I think the team could do really well to see a therapist. Mental health is very serious and should be taken seriously
[0:13:12] chrisiirc: damn :(
[0:13:19] NPBeharry: I think Carl is just trying to be as mature as possible about it, making it public wasn’t a good move
[0:13:21] figurines: Thank you
[0:13:23] Zyphur7: Xaryu Redemption Arc INCOMING
[0:13:25] Facetiou5: please show CC done for final game
[0:13:27] jmaz_27: @chrisiirc see what i mean? got nothing better going in on your life so you just sit and crave this shit
[0:13:27] rhythmicirl: screaming matches??
[0:13:31] atorob: Ill tell you right now, Carl is one of the nicest ppl ive met through this game, I give him alot of shit, but even last year when I was down, and not around.  He was one of the only ppl that reached out to see how things were going.  And im not his teammate lol
[0:13:39] L0WIIE: :(
[0:13:41] volxine: sorry this all happened man
[0:13:42] frege2k: @00ZZEE whats weird about it? they practice before tourney and realize they don't want to deal with breakdowns
[0:13:43] Steff_988: vod review second series! :)
[0:13:44] bonern123: @NPBeharry ofc its a good move making it public
[0:13:50] PineTreesz: a xaryu pika tourny final would cure cancer.
[0:13:53] DodjyQ: unhealthy enviro
[0:13:56] bigbagsdhx: how else are you guys supposed to handle it besides going your seperate ways no break up is pretty lol
[0:13:58] Minimove: You should still send jelly a private message and just ask if hes doing okey. he could be depressed or something, not good to be alone during those times, if that's the case
[0:14:10] chrisiirc: @jmaz_27 youre really bad vibes, please leave me alone
[0:14:11] freyjiiaa: That's so upsetting to hear, I'm sorrt. :( <3
[0:14:15] palawakeup: what is he talking about chat i just got here
[0:14:16] zlovett08: the fuckin red coats
[0:14:20] palawakeup: someone tldr?
[0:14:26] 00ZZEE: @frege2k They have said that its been an ongoing thing for 6+ years, its not bad practice that lead to the kick
[0:14:27] brkyuqi: Can we get wiz to turn on his stream next
[0:14:29] bobbybigbuxx: you stole all streges viewers kekw
[0:14:33] Little_Cap: @brkyuqi yes
[0:14:36] Khrivix: Khrivix subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 19 months! 
[0:14:37] shad3dspectr3: @brkyuqi KEKW
[0:14:39] Rayyymz: hey pika! first series was brutal but supported you guys all the way through!
[0:14:42] glennsplendid: Everyone in chat seems to be physiatrists, it's crazy lol. Perfect relationships here.
[0:14:43] steez0tv: as a mm main i feel bad for Jelly he is jsut can't bring the gameplay as he used to cause the current meta is to harsh for mm
[0:14:47] hot6auce: peepoSad
[0:14:47] mvpala_tv: i feel like all these defenses are corroborated lmaooo
[0:14:49] PineTreesz: @Minimove sounds like proffesional help would be the more appropriate move here. Can't expect pika to act like a therapist.
[0:14:53] scoopzitV: it is crazy what happens behind closed doors man.
[0:14:54] McLaughlin11: dude its all love from me pikabooMove pikabooMove but whats up with this mog for real
[0:14:59] th3b3astcj: hunter class was holding u guys back imo
[0:15:00] Farfetchdxx: thanks for the TLDR - just got here
[0:15:05] lucki_val: can we write a Twitlonger
[0:15:15] Minimove: @PineTreesz that's what friends do bro, got any?
[0:15:16] SarzLiveTV: if you don't got haters, you ain't doing it right
[0:15:19] praisedtwitch: woulda thought you & jb wouldve been the closest since yall been teammates the longest (2014)
[0:15:27] nikthevoker: lack of common sense is what i would expect LUL
[0:15:29] Tnarg_Helped_Us: @Pikabooirl y'all are mid 20's right?  the farther past that age I get, the more I realize it was probably one of the toughest periods of my life.  hoping for the best everyone
[0:15:32] DodjyQ: are you guys 3 man?
[0:15:33] bobbybigbuxx: the general public is about as smart as a golden retriever
[0:15:34] shaayynee: waaaaaait so yall didnt do it for an extra 1000$? craaaazyyyy.... idk the actual prize money but people thinking that kinda crazy
[0:15:34] Lurn: you think people have coherent thoughts and don't operate in a hivemind?
[0:15:35] Shirotten: kubzy lost its up to u guys to get to the finals and make sure its a NA vs NA so we dont remain colonists
[0:15:36] dskamin29: wow tourneys have prizes? i thought they were just for fun
[0:15:37] NightMunchies: cheer with  =beer
[0:15:42] MadbadQT: I don't know the average age of folks here, but this is life. People get fired, relationships fade, etc. Life goes on.
[0:15:44] steez0tv: Is jelly really going to be Dark Ranger in Eacho?
[0:15:45] Lurn: :O
[0:15:50] Slayen84: @Pikabooirl people being logical.... crazy
[0:15:54] warnings__: pika im off the bevs heavy can u carry me
[0:15:55] Cdewky: Yoooo
[0:15:56] nikthevoker: @Lurn ^
[0:15:57] chrye_xx: @raikenxz not needed at all dude
[0:16:06] dmay93: what happened any tldr
[0:16:08] pmanfit91: @Lurn Not my business, but did you get to talk to him? He ok? Saw your message on his stream.
[0:16:10] jimmybuckitz: guys stop making fun of someone with mental@health issues
[0:16:11] NightMunchies: things happen
[0:16:12] 00ZZEE: @frege2k AWC downtime or after the tournament, it is not that difficult to find a WAY better time to do it
[0:16:13] Cdewky: You guys spanked voidgg tho
[0:16:14] reneyu: what do you think about hoolibang ?
[0:16:22] highlord1991: yooo
[0:16:26] brewtank: relationships are tough prob was a building up thing. if you’ve had long relationships it makes sense. not easy
[0:16:27] aframpp: will you talk to jelly?
[0:16:28] whitegarp: Hello, could you recommend a class for beginner in wow classic?
[0:16:28] Moonrake: was it hard to lock in for the tourny because of it?  or easier?
[0:16:30] chrye_xx: Crazy how quickly so many of yall in chat are just taking sides and saying “fk this dude” when you’re just simply a spectator of their relationships.
[0:16:31] JBugaboo: wait you wouldn't burn a 10 year friendship for an extra 500$?
[0:16:32] figurines: Sterge almost cries at one point. it's super sad
[0:16:33] tawkey: I hope he is ok, Jelly is a BEAST.
[0:16:41] Aisssey: imagine blizz actually balancing this game better so jb could play more over the years. same for liquid with mes, smh.
[0:16:44] DodjyQ: if you guys win this gonna be a netflix documentary
[0:16:44] spoikkii: @Pikabooirl just send him some message, ask if hes okay and that kinda stuff, like man to man. Depression is serious deep shit that can really hurt him.
[0:16:49] Shirotten: im more pissed 2 NA teams tanked to eurotrash
[0:16:56] illiteratex: wait why?
[0:16:58] fundayskt: all because u guys didnt wanna practice a comp?
[0:17:00] TumbleShaman: Sounds like he's lost one of his best friends, and it's spilled over into his work life. Shitty situation.
[0:17:01] isharpsword: bro he is your teammate why dont u massege him @Pikabooirl
[0:17:01] illiteratex: havent u talked tohim
[0:17:03] kzeelol: how is that a good thing
[0:17:05] alllucknoskill: dang so its all carl and wizk fault?
[0:17:05] Peachxp_: wahts a long time? when i hear that i think weeks+months
[0:17:08] trivotix: Vince = Jelly?
[0:17:08] kzeelol: u dont talk to friend?
[0:17:09] Xiunitv: @Shirotten this is the real travesty
[0:17:12] reneyu: what do you think about hoolibang ?
[0:17:13] saveslol: wait, you don’t talked to your teammate?
[0:17:14] haendicap: @fundayskt no dumbass, use common sense
[0:17:18] exteps: all i saw was cdews tweet, have no idea what happened
[0:17:23] PineTreesz: @fundayskt did you miss the part where the dude has been mentally unstable for 6+ years?
[0:17:27] NightMunchies: yup vince -JB
[0:17:29] Lehhride: Parasocial Andy's feasting tonight. Just focus on the tourney boys good luck. none of this shit needs to be public lol
[0:17:29] snozeberriess: tryouts?? 1400 mage with good vibes here
[0:17:35] ognolove: This making me hella sad....
[0:17:49] micahtack: why not just talk to him lol
[0:17:51] dompolite: @Lehhride so true
[0:17:51] AsdOfc: @xiunitv how? Still not used to it after all this time?
[0:17:52] privategravy: RPS isn't gonna do well into these EU teams imo
[0:17:55] TheMercDeadpool: What was with the guardian druid?
[0:17:55] Facetiou5: pika please show Crowd Control done in final game
[0:17:55] stone12033: so it was all between jelly carl and wiz?
[0:17:55] reneyu: what do you think about hoolibang ?
[0:17:57] alllucknoskill: feels very unmovelike :(
[0:17:59] hvmantv: What you need to do to elevate a 6-10 year friendship? Block everyone on some random platform called DISCORD. KEKW
[0:18:00] BlueclipseTV: what happened, what did i miss?
[0:18:01] lucki_val: can i try out currently sitting at 1200 CR
[0:18:01] Shirotten: kubzy needs a new team
[0:18:06] 00ZZEE: @frege2k its not "acting like nothing happened" if its been a thing for 6+ years then they could easily have found a better time to do it
[0:18:06] figurines: When you say you "haven't talked to him in a while" it sounds sorta like it wasn't working with you two already?
[0:18:07] McLaughlin11: is it the stress that lead to this mog @Pikabooirl ???
[0:18:10] locombg: Pika clearly not as close lol what are y'all getting at he doesn't have to talk to him he was wiz and abs friend
[0:18:10] Voriq: @Pikabooirl you getting BLACKED tonight?
[0:18:10] xkarppa: @micahtack you cant be serious
[0:18:13] scoopzitV: surely him being benched so many arena tourni seasons and Hunters just not being viable, eventually he would quit or play a class that's the flavor for that season.
[0:18:15] fredslfm: @Xiunitv should be used to it by now KEKW
[0:18:15] PaimayTV: dang, I didn't think it was this big, sucks they're going through it :(
[0:18:16] soberday123: Very PC of you
[0:18:16] SVang25: I still love the move
[0:18:17] illiteratex: u gonna get a 4th?
[0:18:17] DodjyQ: were u and jelly not close?
[0:18:26] treazzzzz: All things must come to an end
[0:18:28] NightMunchies: ITS REAL LIFE SHIT  not CRAFT
[0:18:33] meowmeow03278: haha ppl taking a dead game seriously xD
[0:18:35] hashtagstronger: yea, he was hurt man

[0:20:01] Steely97x: looking for a 4th ?
[0:20:01] DouzySham: @Pikabooirl Jelly currently thinks it is permanent, you need some communication\
[0:20:02] Steff_988: @Pikabooirl , Palumor said you are a multimilioner when people said its about the prize money. what do you have to say about that?
[0:20:03] Minimove: @DodjyQ he was just banning people left and right
[0:20:03] Farfetchdxx: sometimes a break is healthy for everyone
[0:20:04] hawgcast: ive had some down times with my best dudes and if you really care you end up making up

[0:20:09] jujudrew: yo i stopped watching because i had to put my kid to sleep where did you guys play lava lava already?
[0:20:10] NathanC45: I think everyone just needs some room to breathe
[0:20:16] hiueeee: blink 182 broke up twice and now are together again , there is hope
[0:20:18] Johnykarate: im sure pika would just give him 2k if they won. i dont think pika or there team are feining for money that bad
[0:20:18] bxmang: damn man
[0:20:19] NightMunchies: sterge is no answering shit it seems
[0:20:23] isharpsword: bro he is your teammate why dont u massege him @Pikabooirl
[0:20:23] Iceflows84: Get through the tourney. See where Jelly is mentally. If he's not good then I'd say recruit new teammate. U wouldn't really think about it right now.
[0:20:25] bxmang: sad
[0:20:27] sonoma121: lots of unsubbers in the chat, what are you doing with your lives?
[0:20:29] croptopkaren: I think u need to get carl a PR manager - u did so much better at this than he did lol
[0:20:29] moongloomm: wtb context
[0:20:36] flames222: pika, when are you going to get some real gains going at the gym? you got that 15 year old pool boy look lmao jk
[0:20:38] snozeberriess: @pikabooirl Time helps all wounds
[0:20:39] hvmantv: What you need to do to elevate a 6-10 year friendship? Block everyone on some random platform called DISCORD. KEKW
[0:20:41] locked29: sounds like absterge made the call to cut him
[0:20:41] BR0TH0RITY: @isharpsword just stop man
[0:20:43] Dartaru: I just tuned in what is going on?
[0:20:44] nikthevoker: so its alwys the healers fault LUL
[0:20:44] Kelaenopanda: You guys need to go on a cruise! Hook up with some cougars, get your relax on!
[0:20:44] scoopzitV: just let him cool off and see what happens I'm sure he will come back, and I'm sure he said stuff he shouldn't have said.
[0:20:48] soberday123: how do you unfollow?
[0:20:49] NightMunchies: Follow Pika

[0:20:57] superblur: /unfollow
[0:20:59] McLaughlin11: look at the bright side man youre 6 4 240 and youre going to have a big second half of the tournament tomorrow
[0:20:59] llDakaill: @isharpsword teammate and friends are 2 different things
[0:20:59] illiteratex: when u havent talked to your 4th on the team - do you think that the non communicative relationship had a lot to do with the tension?
[0:21:00] makavelitvz: not worth the negativity
[0:21:01] BR0TH0RITY: @isharpsword he will handle it however he wants
[0:21:08] jimmybuckitz: the truth is jelly needs to work on himself as a person mentally first until he is healthy and then if he is allowed to return to be respectful and constructive at all times , coming from a 15 year wow addict who ruined his life and has done therapy <<<<
[0:21:09] soberday123: /unfollow
[0:21:09] realmuhmal: gl for tomorrow lfg
[0:21:10] denliveshere: pikabooMove
[0:21:11] rhythmicirl: not tryna be negative, but he did the same to me in wod after we played together all of mop and most of wod together
[0:21:11] wode406: @locked29 yes. Jelly also sorta implied it too.
[0:21:14] aframpp: IRL time together?
[0:21:16] exteps: where can i catch up on wtf happened lol
[0:21:16] PineTreesz: lets hope the pharmacy gets back in stock of what ever they were out of.
[0:21:18] treehealage1: decades to recover the year is 2055 the move has finally regrouped
[0:21:19] dompolite: @Kelaenopanda ya sex is the cure for everything.
[0:21:23] flace01: sexual tension
[0:21:25] illiteratex: for sure
[0:21:25] sourbutts: sounds like everyone just needs  to MOVE on
[0:21:26] Xawo87: still, ive checked 4 people speaking on the issue, what EXACTLY is the issue? he say some shit or what?
[0:21:26] saptoablind: Tbh... Jelly needed to be sub'd in more for awc attempts.
[0:21:28] happymonkk: what happened ?
[0:21:28] NightMunchies: lol
[0:21:30] hemm__: sounds like a shitty situation all around, hope it works out for everyone in the end
[0:21:31] bogei: from what i heard from JB's stream it seems that he was pissed about no one beingthere for him when he got everyones back?  Not sure what it really is from other perspective though
[0:21:31] DodjyQ: jellybean did say the move was dead to him
[0:21:35] hvmantv: @rhythmicirl who?
[0:21:36] switchsy: can bring your life into your work though
[0:21:36] derbs2: probably not best to address it too much more on twitch too.. chatters bouncing from steam to stream saying he said she said.. only gonna add fuel to the fire
[0:21:39] steez0tv: You guys should regroup set up things in the Ice cream shop cheers
[0:21:40] MisterThatDude: yeah life likes to pile shit on all at once
[0:21:40] Xawo87: all im hearing is its in the "feels"
[0:21:41] praisedtwitch: i mean ur a big part of the team are u not, why not take action and try to mend the team relationship @Pikabooirl
[0:21:41] superblur: Thats its - its sexual tension
[0:21:42] switchsy: can’t *
[0:21:43] atorob: Nobody knows what the future holds, its not our job to speculate, be here, have fun, and support the community.  Let the team handle the team
[0:21:44] Blitzylive: does that mean you'll play DH now?
[0:21:49] jimmybuckitz: the truth is jelly needs to work on himself as a person mentally first until he is healthy and then if he is allowed to return to be respectful and constructive at all times , coming from a 15 year wow addict who ruined his life and has done therapy <<<<
[0:21:55] waitimdesyncd: Jelly was always super positive when you guys won screaming "way to go team!!" but you guys were streaming so maybe he just wanted to be positive on stream. But sometimes the people that can be the happiest can swing and be the saddest :/
[0:21:56] Aimed57: I think it’s sad that this had to be blown up in the middle of tourney. takes away from the hype of the ggs today
[0:21:56] rhythmicirl: @hvmantv the guy hes talking about
[0:22:04] asvkev: w/e people say. I had fun watching you. Proud of you man you play good :D GG!
[0:22:11] Hieneken06: rps won’t win awc
[0:22:14] daehyuun: most people are just blindsided, jelly always seemed very chill on his stream
[0:22:15] hashtagstronger: @jimmybuckitz you dont know the full story so lets just chill buddy
[0:22:15] Blitzylive: who will play DH now?
[0:22:18] sourbutts: fuck it, put the boxing gloves and just settle it old school
[0:22:19] exolust90: Is it time to try something besides RPS?
[0:22:19] DontDv8: DontDv8 subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 4 months! 
[0:22:24] ihave4pouchesinrn: for someone that has been playing wow PVP, I’m so impressed you have such an understanding/mature brain
[0:22:26] sourbutts: or mak'gorah in classic hardcore
[0:22:27] hashtagstronger: @sourbutts LUL W!
[0:22:27] lukex20duelist: @jimmybuckitz u know nothing ab his mental state why comment this
[0:22:28] cano_________: hello super rogue, from CHILE!! :)
[0:22:30] CardiacKcc: RPS isn't it
[0:22:32] Iceflows84: Don't beat yourself up too much. You ALL are amazing people and players. Much love to all you guys.
[0:22:37] wode406: @ihave4pouchesinrn this
[0:22:40] Xawo87: its crazy its this big tho, but still not, like yall gotta understand yall are a team too that we follow. so just like any sports team, u wanna know whats up and how it might affect the team. I know it "sounds" stupid, but its true
[0:22:40] stone12033: hopefully thug cleave does not become meta next patch xd
[0:22:45] Johnykarate: i think chat is going a little crazy about it as well its clear that its a complicated situation and nobody in chat is gonna know lmao
[0:22:46] jujudrew: if jelly was there today would yall have swapped comps?
[0:22:48] jimmybuckitz: iv watched jelly and know what about what he has gone through
[0:23:01] provo2100: Sounds like you all need some time apart to let things settle and then maybe reach out to see if you can talk things over and maybe if situation allow it, reconnect as friends
[0:23:02] BR0TH0RITY: @micahtack looks like people are getting flamed for offering unsolicited advice to me
[0:23:11] smergeI: Any vod reviews today on the matches?
[0:23:16] hashtagstronger: @jimmybuckitz you dont get the full picture from a stream KEKW
[0:23:19] TheeOcean: you and him got into it in front of a hotel
[0:23:20] steez0tv: I can feel what Vince feeling when he saw he is not in the rooster it's tuff bro
[0:23:31] notoriousztv: xaryu joining the move?
[0:23:31] jimmybuckitz: I’m talking about the person
[0:23:31] Little_Cap: @Pikabooirl Would you guys still be considered the longest standing team even losing Vince?
[0:23:32] suspicious94: gets scary though, I know you guys all care about Vince, he seems in a really dark and vulnerable place and you hope that he can find the help he needs instead of feeling even more alone. mental health is a scary thing, hug your friends everyone.
[0:23:34] hiueeee: put me in coach
[0:23:37] MelodyRx: do you think this is just a meta issue
[0:23:37] jfknndy50561: what happened?
[0:23:38] jimmybuckitz: because I was him
[0:23:42] xtyronblaze: cant you just talk to each other because youve been friends for that long???
[0:23:43] JBugaboo: CARYU FOR 4TH?
[0:23:43] Aimed57: on the bright side finding a new 4th (multiclasser) could be huge
[0:23:45] jimmybuckitz: ruining relationships
[0:23:49] dubbfiend: pika could become a politician
[0:23:50] Facetiou5: pika can you please swap details window to crowd control done
[0:23:51] navetfris: what happened with jelly
[0:23:51] r0ck249: xaryu for 4th
[0:23:52] ihave4pouchesinrn: TM Crusader confirmed
[0:23:53] Zughoul: So are you, carl, and wiz not playing together in the finals tomorrow?
[0:23:54] McLaughlin11: also the tallest and most handsome team
[0:23:54] blesns: i hope everything gets settled love watching yall tbh
[0:23:54] r0ck249: get him back
[0:23:56] Sparticle100: what's going on?  The move breaking up?
[0:23:57] kh9911: who win guys today ?
[0:23:57] sinfullfilled: what do you think my bro
[0:23:57] asteroid_da_druid: hi pika
[0:24:00] waitimdesyncd: time to get xaryu in
[0:24:00] SihillSP: @ihave4pouchesinrn CHILLL
[0:24:05] privategravy: xaryus time to shine
[0:24:05] atorob: I 100% could beat Liquid, let me know when you need me
[0:24:07] scoopzitV: when was the last tourniment  he played in?
[0:24:07] jimmybuckitz: destroying people . it’s my MO. that’s why they know jimmy b from Pa to Colorado
[0:24:09] pragma90: drfeltgood can fill the spot if you mod him
[0:24:10] Little_Cap: No I mean currently, or would it be a new streak since youve lost Vince?
[0:24:13] shaayynee: wouldnt liquid tho? they only added sam in bfa but mes trill and cdew were together over 6 years right?
[0:24:13] nemcoy: I just joined, Jelly left?
[0:24:16] abrakkkk: GET MVQ
[0:24:18] mrmsix6: vince should pull a larry david and show up to work tomorrow and act like nothing happened
[0:24:19] Johnykarate: its clear pika and vince are friends becasue they have mutual friends
[0:24:21] 2morebeers: sounds like yall just need to knuckle up and share a pitcher after. good way to bury the hatch
[0:24:21] Graffanator: didnt have this on the 2024 doc
[0:24:24] hvmantv: I dont understand. From Jelly/Sterge/Pika PoV, it feels like the situation escalated A LOT once he blocked everyone on his sub-discord server. This seems odd to me.
[0:24:24] waitimdesyncd: @atorob can i be your substitute on the team
[0:24:24] gertwildy: off topic, do you know where luminosity gaming went? (brain etc)?
[0:24:27] dorgardra: now you guys can bring in crusader in for the 4th
[0:24:30] BR0TH0RITY: @micahtack he isn’t asking for opinions or advice and this is a sensitive subject. just offer support smh
[0:24:36] praisedtwitch: but ur still ON the team, and ur a big part of the team, dont know what the harm is in reaching out
[0:24:39] SihillSP: @gertwildy retires
[0:24:42] flames222: pika bottles it up like a man
[0:24:42] moongloomm: @Pikabooirl can you give context for those of us who dont know whats going on
[0:24:47] memil141: i love u bro Rspect!
[0:24:47] TheMercDeadpool: What was with the guardian druid? Anyone know?
[0:24:48] 1silentcs: what happened i saw on twitter somebody callin you guys bullies
[0:24:49] benova9000mf: did u win
[0:24:50] nemcoy: u only do that with Chat
[0:24:50] dskamin29: u guys should recruit drizzy
[0:24:51] DodjyQ: u a lone wolf?
[0:24:53] memil141: fuck yy
[0:24:56] waitimdesyncd: smoke it out
[0:24:56] sourbutts: facts
[0:24:56] Notreallygood: I mean, its called a business relationship for a reason
[0:24:56] locombg: man if he toxic he has to go he seems like he was even when I watched his stream he was crying bout something random drama boy
[0:24:57] rhythmicirl: trust in the bev
[0:24:57] JBugaboo: @flames222 lmao
[0:24:59] gabbagool: f it 1am faded bathroom stream again
[0:24:59] navetfris: what happened
[0:25:00] hiueeee: got to stay close to the healer for sure
[0:25:05] Notreallygood: Smart Pika imo
[0:25:05] illiteratex: waht are ur thoughts of getting a new 4th?
[0:25:13] JBugaboo: hope you're good bruv but your mog is giga trash @Pikabooirl
[0:25:17] NightMunchies: let it take time things will mend in time
[0:25:19] thisisthotcaller: i mean, jelly never behaves like this on stream, so he has to know that something isnt right with his behaviour. Hope youre all good man
[0:25:20] Thoreya: hes on your team'
[0:25:32] fundayskt: thats so tight
[0:25:41] numba9os: i mean you got social everyday life then you got your everyday gamer life/teamates  and you just dont interact the 2 lol
[0:25:43] jimmybuckitz: go to the winchester
[0:25:47] Iceflows84: I feel like you and Xar are closer than you and Jelly.
[0:25:49] Alexiusblack: I don't know man, I started following you honestly because of jelly and you... honestly ab is a desperate healer in most cases..
[0:25:51] thephilberry: even if you guys aren’t close irl, that’s wild you and jelly are on a team and just don’t talk
[0:25:57] scoopzitV: he got kicked or left?
[0:25:59] lRuGl: sheeesh gl tomorow big son!

[0:26:19] MisterThatDude: big raid
[0:26:19] terranapart: Hi Jason!
[0:26:23] McLaughlin11: crazy to learn that 6 4 240 dudes have rough mornings too
[0:26:23] Texdizzle: wait prime subs still get ads
[0:26:24] nikthevoker: @Nvellen time  to  step up! the team needs you!
[0:26:24] saamos: @scoopzitV they were going to have him sit out ended up in him getting kicked from what was said so far
[0:26:25] Texdizzle: dafuq
[0:26:26] BMaStream: It's not that wild to be on a team with someone and not be the closest. I think people who think otherwise haven't been on a team of anything before
[0:26:27] Blitzylive: invite him back
[0:26:27] dmgcurry: lmk if u need a 4th
[0:26:31] ixiamain: Yurrrr
[0:26:32] xtyronblaze: it hurts to see you guys having drama tbh
[0:26:34] shawdowfax77: where jelly go?
[0:26:34] beanboydk: Its kinda hard to be calm when ur best friends are 1v3 and kick you off the team you been part of for 6 years??? @Pikabooirl
[0:26:39] asteroid_da_druid: thanks for the raid absterge
[0:26:39] tigerslap_ow: lets see this mog from the front
[0:26:43] invincibledalyeth: sup pika
[0:26:45] YourBoyBP: @McLaughlin11 That's exactly me lol.
[0:26:45] trapped2pointoh: too much fog in the brain

[0:26:46] citricxy: @pikabooirl Bro Crusader will be your new 4th?

[0:28:13] volxine: critical thinking is hard for ppl lol
[0:28:13] Johnykarate: that makes no sense any over 10 would know that wouldnt happen
[0:28:14] Ambersulfr: guys pika isn't surprised this happened, that tells you all you need to know KEKW
[0:28:15] soberday123: 6 years and you dump him - you're a great guy
[0:28:17] Minimove: whaazz said something that the drama inside the team had been going on for years. he heard that from sterge stream
[0:28:22] beanboydk: @Pikabooirl so they plotted to kick him without informing him that hes on thin ice?
[0:28:22] bobbybigbuxx: just completely ignore comments like that, it only gives it more power
[0:28:22] provo2100: That assumption happen on Absterge chat too
[0:28:23] shnoop284: lmao silly eu
[0:28:26] gdodmebxu: yeah that's obviously ridiculous
[0:28:26] Vyy0824: chat does not understand theyre under 13
[0:28:26] krispyworld: susge
[0:28:27] hashtagstronger: well he seemed to have gotten told overnight rather than a "warning" or whatever
[0:28:27] sylvanas97: who kicked him @Pikabooirl carl-wizk... org owner ?
[0:28:28] Jervun: Hey!
[0:28:30] Thoreya: jelly got kicked out after discord he said ICANT
[0:28:30] 00ZZEE: There were always gonna be drama around this, but the timing was really really bad
[0:28:33] darthvaxis: yeah that should be pretty obvious
[0:28:35] figurines: I mean its been a while since you and vince have gotten along right? There's a reason we don't see you guys playing together often i assume
[0:28:39] hvmantv: Well, the story super-escalated after a random BAN on his Sub-Discord Server, so ye, we assume is childish.
[0:28:40] zatrian7: @soberday123 dude thats such a stupid comentary LUL
[0:28:40] Johnykarate: its only a like 3k and u guys to be fair have plenty of money and arent feining for it
[0:28:40] DouzySham: we know the prize money is miniscule compared to how much you make from streaming
[0:28:40] NightMunchies: confuding as fk
[0:28:43] glennsplendid: nah logical sure but ppl are fucking breaindead.
[0:28:43] PSHllllT: Yeah absterge confirmed there was a problem for 6 of those years, wich is concerning
[0:28:44] aframpp: xD
[0:28:45] sourbutts: pika cant afford his break discs so he kicked jelly off the team in case they win right?
[0:28:47] aBradAbroad: so why was he kicked? people wouldn't assume it was a random thing if there was a reason? @Pikabooirl
[0:28:47] nikthevoker: common sense is rare, idiocy is contageious LUL
[0:28:48] keeeptryin: @Vyy0824 nope theyre 40 and never been outside
[0:28:51] Alexiusblack: why is ab saying that you couldn't stand the pressure with him for 6 years.. then why did you play with him for so long
[0:28:51] Promocodebaj: Twitch chat would chase a squirrel if one ran by
[0:28:51] Arisolo: @Pikabooirl I do think the easiest way to end amicably is to give him his share anyway, even if you're never playing with him again
[0:28:52] NPBeharry: honestly the people in Carl’s chat before he even spoke were all so fried
[0:28:53] aframpp: Pikaboo got too much charisma
[0:28:54] rayncoat_: did I miss something?

[0:29:48] Necrolancer47: lets be real its time to reroll off hunter Kappa
[0:29:49] treehealage1: How does it feel that Whazz dodged the rogue mirror matchup?

[0:30:29] Thoreya: so he was wrong
[0:30:36] shad3dspectr3: I'd be lying to you if I said I haven't ended friendships, it sucks but I'm glad I did. it'll all work out brother.
[0:30:36] MisterThatDude: actually WoW's fault for not making hunter mad OP for at least a season
[0:30:37] Minimove: @ElendrilEU cuz chanimal is a monster
[0:30:40] Lurn: NPBeharry golden is reviving just to save the move and to pay the mortgages
[0:30:42] NightMunchies: it builds up
[0:30:45] switchsy: seems like towards the end of the stream he realized some of the shit he was saying was silly… didn’t want anyone to send you guys hate, but a lot of damage done
[0:30:45] hashtagstronger: @MisterThatDude 5Head
[0:30:45] absterge: The whole reason we got Jelly to play a DH was to be more of a team together and have him play games, but that ironically enough escalated the issues even more which is why it "feels" so sudden for people when it's been a 6+ year issue
[0:30:52] NightMunchies: ik how it is
[0:30:52] shawdowfax77: hot take maybe Vince was right?

[0:31:40] sneedyz: damn so this is what happens when you play a shit tier class for 10 years
[0:31:40] imagamerbby: Pika, Is it safe to assume that the consensus of the team was that Vince needs time to figure out what's going on IRL that's bleeding into in game situations before it hinders things any furthers both in game and IRL?

[0:31:44] dread_kitten: LETS GO JASON, LETS GO! I call Pikaboo Jason because I know him IRL (not a huge deal)
[0:31:46] dopezs: The issue is that you guys like to play only one comp so even when u bring in another player ( maybe ) it's kinda hard to involve him into the roster !

[1:09:12] stonedboodah: HUH
[1:09:13] 00ZZEE: The important stuff is, why kick him right before the tournament and not earlier/later if it has been a thing for 6+ years, feels like the "6+ years" thing is to safe face for a bad situation
[1:09:13] crookygrinz: Ofc, he plays shadow priest

[1:09:26] Canes707: he never gets PT.. I’ve been following for years and homie never plays unless ya’ll are losing and want to try something new… just go look for a Mae some where… it’s tough but move on and get a mage/lock or something

[1:09:57] darthD3AN: your ignoring everyone saying xar for 4th
[1:10:02] Johnykarate: @Pikabooirl did u actually get to see what he said on stream
[1:10:06] Jiviex: You should make the move into an org and buy a league and valorant team.
[1:10:07] ChumpSeason: mending fences should happen... down the road.
[1:10:09] Wabbajakkc: well have they explained themselves from their pov yet
[1:10:16] mortiswow: But wizz plays shadow priest which isnt the best class either
[1:10:19] 00ZZEE: @Winring86 Then they should say that and then what jelly said makes more sense
[1:10:20] Snurpletv: i wanna read the drama where do i go read it
[1:10:24] getrektzaaaaaa: sub me in coach i am 1.5k exp
[1:10:27] Uberbane: xar won't come back to retail KEKW
[1:10:29] steebet: honestly from a viewer's point of view it's hard to really have a real take because we only see what's on stream so obviously there's a lot of context missing - ignore the twitch chat takes imo
[1:10:30] Zerksyera: honestly, it gives your team a better chance
[1:10:31] myodoctor: why aren’t you and jelly close? yall have been on the same team for years and spent more time together than with most people
[1:10:32] probeu: KEKW

[2:19:16] dilly_wow: I've been working on the gains lately so what I usually do is start it out with a smoothie I put in 10 egg shells (i skip the insides) 13 scoops of protein powder, a tblsp of gorilla semen, 3 pages from xaryus cookbook, and then I mix it with some peanut butter and 4 bang energy drinks
[2:19:18] FlashZappa: @Pikabooirl lets watch some lava lava games. Study the opponent.
[2:19:19] atorob: WE NEED THIS
[2:19:19] Boomer_Brian: 500

[2:19:43] icantheartheinternet: ok
[2:19:43] Samurayny: This is the fallout of The Move: First they kick out Jelly from the tier. That leads to decease in overall view count for all members of the move. Wizk will be forced to quit the game the pursue his McDonalds career. Absterge will indeed become international model and move to france just like chan and Pika will be the only one who still streams 5 years from now.

[2:59:43] nevercared40: @Ryzehx I do not main DH just people always cry when a spec is good why not balance instead of nerfing a class into the ground, which is what happens when people cry on a forum. Like you have said it is comps also that come into play skilll has a lot to do with it also.
