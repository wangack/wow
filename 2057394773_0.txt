[1:10:08] chrono_za: huh
[1:10:32] Archmage_Michael: Porkihavoc's current build has no calicified and extended spikes. Are these talents not good anymore?
[1:10:38] NotIzzzy: how does blizzard even break the leggo quest
[1:10:40] alrajhio: imagine playing sod while watching twitch rn
[1:11:31] Archmage_Michael: I looking through RIO top VDHs and everyone is playing a different build. annoying.
[1:12:09] summerflarez: how much more chill for you is playing dps compared to tanking these high keys?

[1:13:11] Theliahh: @Linith_Heart YEP
[1:13:17] whiskeyhide: melee > ranged this season
[1:13:20] chrono_za: bad take on god
[1:13:23] Thowarr: @whiskeyhide agreed
[1:13:31] summerflarez: rly? i thought ranged was always supposed to be way easier/less stuff to dodge
[1:13:36] HarveyPls: aimoki ret PepeLa
[1:13:42] dango0n: NO FIREDUP!!
[1:13:46] whiskeyhide: usually but this season melee has more "live" mechanics and less run tf around
[1:13:50] crickyb24: My guy is in MDI 1 week before the cup with a team he's hardly played with and we're cooking boomkin keys POG
[1:14:03] TrustTheScience: @summerflarez generally maybe, but its for sure season of the melee
[1:14:37] whiskeyhide: 2nd boss of blackrook is the biggest melee payphone fight ive ever seen
[1:14:43] diamondq8i: are u tanking in mdi ?
[1:14:52] misran: season of the melee (top keys and mdi all wizards) xdd
[1:14:59] dango0n: or gorgers lol
[1:15:15] Archmage_Michael: but still range DPS are tuned super OP
[1:15:34] TrustTheScience: @misran you're argument is top 0.1% of players?
[1:15:38] Archmage_Michael: SP, Fire, Destro, Moonkin. all over tuned
[1:15:44] diamondq8i: grim rail road with seasonal affix and lower kara Kreygasm
[1:15:50] Thowarr: well unless you're a mage or warlock
[1:16:00] whiskeyhide: ruby life pools + sanguine/storming xdd
[1:16:14] yctnm: ramp classes
[1:16:16] Thowarr: Then you can have great dps, good survivability, lots of utility
[1:16:21] summerflarez: what do you consider ''lower keys'' like are they trash for 23s even?
[1:16:25] dango0n: true. I hate fire at the 20 range
[1:16:34] AlphasaurusRexx: is this the mdi team or is dorki tanking
[1:16:37] Archmage_Michael: in lower keys, havoc killed the pack before moonkins damage even starts
[1:16:39] Thowarr: @summerflarez you don't have time to ramp to get to full dps potential
[1:16:44] HarveyPls: @summerflarez i think if you go into a 23 as a boomie with 2 other good dps u will have a bad time
[1:16:45] diamondq8i: so 28 and less
[1:17:02] xGuiha: @AlphasaurusRexx dorki tanks on mdi. He just doesn't tank when growl is in the group
[1:17:09] Thowarr: @HarveyPls go in with, say a DH and Demo lock; gl!
[1:17:15] weezie_61: You are playing with the ENEMY!

[1:18:53] Thowarr: @ItsYent astral form; might as well stay fire chicken
[1:18:54] x_ANiMa: are there even upgrades for your moonboi besides tertiaries?
[1:18:55] AlphasaurusRexx: wait unless im mixing up TGP and MDI
[1:19:09] ItsYent: @Thowarr like is there a downside of astral form? it looks sick
[1:19:37] HarveyPls: RAGEY
[1:19:37] slimmjimmy98: incarn sadge
[1:19:41] dango0n: is this key Deadge?
[1:19:56] Linith_Heart: dorki never gets to have incarn Sadge
[1:20:05] Thowarr: @ItsYent It's like the other forms, you get tired of it after a while. It's been in the game a long time, so most of us have it/used it/etc
[1:20:37] ItsYent: ahh i see, thought there was like a benefit or downside. chicken is cool as shit too lol
[1:20:37] Thowarr: Also I want a non-chicken/astral form so I can finally see my xmog. I'd like to see my xmog.
[1:21:10] ItsYent: for the past two weeks i've had this fasicnation to play a boomie so i am leveling one rn lol
[1:21:10] devilssin123: @dorki maybe a stupid question, how do you play your 3 mins on lower keys? like 20-22 just start playing lock
[1:21:15] slimmjimmy98: @Thowarr I agree I use astral form but its not the same
[1:21:17] Thowarr: There's so many cool nature/astral themed sets, and it's like... whelp, chicken it is
[1:21:27] IAttackYou: xdd
[1:21:31] cocopowdong: new day same boomy death

[1:28:03] SpeedyMcD: kinda off topic but did you see that the lead write for wow had left blizzard back in November? seems metzen actually got rid of danuser..
[1:28:34] Blloood: why do you live in the NA then? just move to europe. Ur job is on the internet anyway
[1:28:43] Chewbaccaw: thats because people in NA have to work 💀
[1:28:48] Blloood: they speak englsh in all of the UK

[1:29:45] Chewbaccaw: i would never do 30's
[1:29:47] Blloood: just more and better people to play with?
[1:29:47] Chewbaccaw: aint no way
[1:29:51] Pechorin333: he could just make an eu account, lol
[1:29:52] Chewbaccaw: im going outside before i do a 30 key

[1:31:38] laranjeira: Why was a theater of pain showing on the keys list
[1:31:59] Valkrien09876: how hard is it to live in these keys as boomy?
[1:32:01] Mortalshare16: who is the moonkin in this key and why do they keep dying
[1:32:05] xjacobtv: It's an addon.

[1:32:52] slimmjimmy98: I bet Dorki got that gyat on him for sure
[1:32:52] Valkrien09876: yeah i have a boomy and want to play but its hard to get into groups because they do no damage like sub 20 and die to everything it seems like
[1:33:57] TunzaTanks: Oldge
[1:33:57] Chewbaccaw: thats good man
[1:34:02] klondike_wow: 11 Aware
[1:34:04] Valkrien09876: how do you get into those higher keys? just get like a group or something i guess

[1:35:12] LucentLady: @morayeden host your own key
[1:35:13] Morayeden: @Morayeden  imNOTcrying
[1:35:14] GrimFandango: @Valkrien09876 if someone is denying you on any class under 20, there's something wrong with either the leader or your profile (rating, ilvl, etc), as every class is viable under 20
[1:35:17] meetmyheat401: has Ret taken over havoc ?
[1:35:18] mulkon: !mdi
[1:35:18] Nightbot: Watch the stream here! (we can't show it through Twitch) youtube.com/warcraft/live

[1:35:35] Kettos: I play resto druid and im thinking instead of roll dps, create another drood for dps
[1:35:54] aarodis: your going to mdi?
[1:35:57] whiskeyhide: for invites yes
[1:35:58] Valkrien09876: @GrimFandango yeah my gear is nothing insane or anything like that but i feel like im playing lobby simulator for an hour before i can get into like a normal ass key
[1:36:09] SniggleJake572: I always love seeing dps complain about not getting invites...have you seen how many dps apply?
[1:36:14] harmless52: tank in mdi or ??
[1:36:18] whiskeyhide: lotta puggers dont want havoc when they already have a vdh
[1:36:24] Nightbot: dorkiHey Join my Discord server! https://discord.gg/yHFTAZn
[1:36:32] TunzaTanks: Ret doesn’t die so surely pugs love it
[1:36:35] Shimorta: @GrimFandango you're probably just applying to keys above your score
[1:36:35] jce91: Do you know about the love fool dummie bro? can use indoors
[1:36:43] misran: i've been farming crests in 18-20s last few days and almost every group has a ret, sometimes 2
[1:36:45] Valkrien09876: have you played any unholy this season @dorki ?
[1:36:49] whiskeyhide: havoc is still mad good
[1:36:56] GrimFandango: @GrimFandango Yeah that's not regular, something is up. Look for groups that don't have a BRez. Worse comes to worse start running your own keys

[1:53:18] Rinehartgaming: I dug reaping but maybe im a psycho
[1:54:08] Morayeden: Just turn tyran and fort into encrypted and awakened.
[1:54:21] NoStress15: Thundering was the best seasonal Kappa
[1:54:25] Kettos: Prideful lmao, the dungeons were so weird with it
[1:54:41] HarveyPls: is the dps meter bugged
[1:54:57] grummwasabi: Prideful was fun cause you had determined routes
[1:54:59] Morayeden: I don't get why they hate positive affixes because they are "too easy"
[1:54:59] HarveyPls: no xdd it looked slow af or something there
[1:55:00] Rinehartgaming: I like to imagine reaping now. Imagine the crazy pulls and then all those lil mobs spawning.
[1:55:13] Ahrmanhamma: Reaping was just fun and didn't slow down your key much. That's all i want
[1:55:25] NoStress15: encrypted was the actual best though
[1:55:26] MrJusSn: would it kill the game to have affixes that buff players and make the dungeon more enjoyable instead of less?
[1:55:36] Kettos: Thundering with only stun would be good, but the dmg was insane
[1:55:42] MrJusSn: it's an infinitely scaling game mode if you want more difficulty do higher keys💀
[1:56:12] Morayeden: It would be lit for those players
[1:56:19] goop: what could this title mean
[1:56:32] Kettos: Well, prideful was kinda a good affix if you played well
[1:56:33] vyni_02: just start the seasonal at +2 ez fix
[1:56:52] HarveyPls: blizzard serving up afflicted in the ass corner of the room in a +7 is actually evil for noobs i think

[1:57:23] guynormally: with kiss/curse it's easier if you do the affix correctly. if you fail the affix it would get even harder. so more coggy loadge with affix, but get a bonus from it
[1:57:37] goop: this is a crazy comp
[1:57:45] guynormally: saying it's just straight up easier is a lazy response
