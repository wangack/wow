[0:57:55] myllaena: 1 is all you need really
[0:57:59] Reap14: Indeed not necessary to have alts
[0:58:01] WhiteKnight74648: That or data centers
[0:58:03] yuheinil: need only 1
[0:58:04] iamed: only reason really is to be on different DCs for now
[0:58:08] Ardentfoxx0017: RP is about the only reason people make alts
[0:58:10] SoriinX: Dos the boosted exp stay after you hit 70 in something?
[0:58:14] Helliebabe: And alts to play with friends on other DCs
[0:58:14] Henji_Airou: Alts is useful for multiple raid clears early on

[0:58:23] Necrothunder: i use retainers as bank space
[0:58:24] Arbszy: You can

[0:58:32] Ariea_Whisper: Only one you have retainers for bank space
[0:58:33] XandrahDragoness: Expensive though
[0:58:34] Reap14: @SoriinX It last for 90 days regardless of how many jobs hit 70
[0:58:37] Renlou1: That’s my problem, I like the aesthetic of a lot of the races and can’t make up my mind
[0:58:41] GhostKaffee: A lot of tanks normally just omni tank
[0:58:44] WhiteKnight74648: you can only transfer only to servers on your data center.
[0:58:45] Ardentfoxx0017: Regions are locked but they announced at fanfest they will be fixing that
[0:58:47] 갓스팀: You can for free in next expansion
[0:58:52] ShadoodHD: home world will show players with the <Wanderer> to their names
[0:58:52] Helliebabe: There was a free transfer when the new DC came out
[0:58:55] Phantom_wulfstan: 12 bucks is for one character  15 is for as many as you want
[0:58:59] SoriinX: @Reap14 Upon joining the server, or for like new players?
[0:59:01] Rheliium: with DC hopping in the next expansion there's not alot of reasons to have more than one character
[0:59:04] xtokyokill: xtokyokill subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 10 months! :)
[0:59:13] WhiteKnight74648: @Towelliee they annouced that they are in teh works to go to different servers on other data centers.
[0:59:16] P1ght: 24h waiting stream D:
[0:59:17] Mecabeast: dmv simulator
[0:59:19] Henji_Airou: Because of how the loot is distributed when raiding, you can clear a raid with half alts half mains, and distribute the loot to the mains. Then you can clear the raid again but with the other mains getting the loot, essentially doubling the loot @Towelliee
[0:59:21] Reap14: @SoriinX Starting a new character on a preferred server gives you the buff
[0:59:24] Helliebabe: Waiting stream :)
