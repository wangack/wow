[0:56:45] zeeAbe: @Gauner_ sorry, got left out from previous one, they are on weekly cooldown to USE, so you can craft many as far as we know, but you can't instantly get max knowledge with those

[1:07:32] PastelByeol: seriously
[1:07:33] PastelByeol: lol
[1:07:34] Zilberg: Nothing really new tbh until Nov 15th

[1:08:21] DeanoTV: i want my new talentss
[1:08:24] KaisenSiru: Pog Animated Short
[1:08:28] Aidler: I'm very sceptical. could be because I don't like the new direction WoW is going in general
[1:08:29] looney199725: they had to make profs a grind because u can get mythic raid ilvl loot
[1:08:33] wakeandbacon95: oh yeah that will be sick

[1:08:44] tylersullins: Can you reshare that google docs link @towelliee
[1:08:46] captiv8: if you play the alpha/beta it kind of kills the hype.  If you are going in fresh then the hype is still there

[1:10:22] ChedaPlays: yea because there is nothing besides flying and proff. it feels so empty, but yea its good like wow 2.0 but they could end something for players to be hyped
[1:10:34] danimoto10: legion was fucking hype
[1:10:38] Zilberg: That kinda sucks though.. Imagine releasing WOTLK and not giving us DKs instead they just give us new talents and a pat on the head LUL
[1:10:41] davided: hi last day with old talents, new talent tomorrow
[1:10:51] looney199725: in before people beg for systems back after DF lol
[1:10:58] Morfoick: @ChedaPlays I think if they add systems, they'll come in patches, we'll see
[1:10:59] wakeandbacon95: im kinda interested in story, so i leveled slowly and read through the quests on beta
[1:11:04] Kelticlore: thats cause wow players are all ready ruined

[1:11:25] captiv8: i'm not saying the beta wasn't hype, i'm saying going into it fresh without having already leveled through the beta or experienced dragonriding keeps you hyped for release
[1:11:34] Akermay: Damned if you do. Damnned if you don't.
[1:11:36] Morfoick: systems added grind and something to do, it'll definitely be interesting to see the complaints in DF base expansion

[1:16:12] captiv8: I think the biggest grind this xpac is gonna be professions.  even if you have the gold to just buy mats, you still have to grind renown for some crafting rcepiets
[1:16:12] Greneer: a new solo challenge would also be nice
[1:16:12] Morfoick: borrowed power to keep the hardcore interested, cosmetics/mounts to keep the casuals interested, Shadowlands had all that
[1:16:19] Kakotan2143: me, i have people i talk to but barely run anything with anyone cause i like to quest my way
[1:16:20] looney199725: the only people asking for this is people who cant play alot to be fair
[1:16:24] ChedaPlays: For me ideal is, when u finish m+ for a day, u have something to do that is fun and challenging to grind for. I dont wanna grind tmog because i did that in shadowlands and im gonna be bored if its like that in new exp
[1:16:27] Kelticlore: maybe those people need to play more then 1 game then who complain theres not enough
[1:16:29] Bogzeh: @X_ArmyVet_X what about all the ppl who dont raid t hen?
[1:16:33] whoisclax: and to me that sounds perfect
[1:16:35] Talason: was draenor even bad?
[1:16:36] erasum: @Towelliee people want the same content cadence as is games like poe, or w/e but it will not happen, people have to except that they have to play other games at the end of contents
[1:16:38] looney199725: its okay for the people who log on for a hour a day but this patch sucks for hardcore players
[1:16:40] Semmspiral: Just give us corruption but with the damn vendor at the start
[1:16:46] DeanoTV: more time to farm mogs and mounts i guess :D
[1:16:46] KaisenSiru: YEP Blame the player's
[1:16:46] maclain67: All that stuff removed... nothing to replace it but same sub price and box price went up... people are being fleeced.
[1:16:50] DarkBeasty_: good morning
[1:16:54] Recording_on_the_grass: dailys with rewards
[1:16:59] Talason: was wod really bad? the leveling was great
[1:17:02] TweektheProphet: I think BFA was right but needed the drops to be better
[1:17:07] ashwing_: Question is when will they turn on legacy damage for Legion/BFA LUL
[1:17:08] PvtHudson093: MoP had the cloak to work towards, WoD had the ring, Legion had the weapons, BFA had the heart and then cloak
[1:17:10] KaisenSiru: More than Wrath!
[1:17:29] DarkBeasty_: idk what is going on with WoW but it keep saying that my gpu driver is out of date which isnt the case but it keep giving me a warning and idk what to do
[1:17:32] BadCarma89: Love that!
[1:17:34] Bogzeh: might be fine then, thats how ff14 is too
[1:17:34] standard999: whats the link to the sheet again?
[1:17:52] Cello_73: Content outside of raid/M+ etc = awesome imo
[1:18:04] ChedaPlays: yea but thats like 2hrs a day maybe 3 and thats it? :D
[1:18:08] Naenis: isnt that better for the game, no every contentc focusses on combat enhancement but on character developement?
[1:18:11] HaxzorJimDuggan: being able to raid log eventually is a plus to me since it makes it easier to manage classic and retail at the same time without falling behind
[1:18:11] Bogzeh: ff14 ure done with vertical progress super fast
[1:18:16] Talason: towelliee do you like oribos?
[1:18:18] xhaven: @standard999 here: https://docs.google.com/document/d/17FyiBOEBaS0WQW9TH7bP6kR5LNu9VjmZLMax3L9i9-4/edit#
[1:18:20] looney199725: ff14 is a game built for casuals tho
[1:18:24] standard999: thanks
[1:18:27] Heracy: I am fine with there being gaps, it makes it feel like I can actually play other games
[1:18:31] AlantoJP: yep yep
[1:18:31] pyBobi: Giga Announcement about Wow or other things?
[1:18:32] George2001k: @towelliee I want to do mythic plus and make money from professions, hoping it will be fun
[1:18:35] wakeandbacon95: thats giga chad approach
[1:18:45] szble: gaps are ok until it becomes dragon soul or soo
[1:18:48] Bogzeh: blizzard needs to be fine with ppl unsubbing after 1 month tho LUL
[1:18:54] PvtHudson093: he knows the drops
[1:18:55] Rizec: or grind mounts transmog reps or any of the bilion other things we can do xD
[1:18:58] sakura_2020: does the mage tower go away with the pre patch?
[1:19:00] Bogzeh: and coming back
[1:19:10] riley_poker: LUL LUL LMFAO
[1:19:14] luckfore: i'd like another lgeendary cloak like grind
[1:19:14] Greneer: @sakura_2020 yes will come back at launch
[1:19:15] riley_poker: Completely missed that
[1:19:15] Hupu_a: when is the announcement?
[1:19:16] HaxzorJimDuggan: time for that ice shaker
[1:19:21] captiv8: can you tell us the story about how you heard about the dragonflight release date yet?
[1:19:22] pyBobi: @sakura_2020 it will come back with DF
[1:19:24] Rottencoarse: @sakura_2020  it'll be disabled for a while but it'll be back
[1:19:26] Infebdo: I can see the drops being a dragonriding skin.
[1:19:26] Kelticlore: underlight angler becomes a tool
[1:19:32] Kakotan2143: I cant wait for tomorrow, I want to mess with the new ui so much
[1:19:33] szble: maybe a battle pet lol
[1:19:39] Zettabyte: #HeKnows Kappa
[1:19:40] Onyxx666: mount or toys would be sick
[1:19:44] looney199725: tell them we want londro boxes for rng chance at tcg loot
[1:19:52] PvtHudson093: Maybe its a mount because there wasnt one from the prepatch event
[1:19:57] zeeAbe: I hope the wow drops are friends to play with, I still need a guild for DF
[1:19:59] thebassdruid: ngl, the talent trees are kind of overwhelming lol
[1:20:01] Bogzeh: and old style legendary weapon or even better ff14 relic weapon style grind would be nice
[1:20:02] Greneer: player power grind would be fine if they were account bound but they never made it that way
[1:20:03] xhaven: more importantly my banks and bags are all filled with stuff from bfa/shadowlands :(
[1:20:04] Whistlingpickle: I haven't played wow since shadowlands launched and im thinking about coming back but on horde this time :)
[1:20:04] Pippinn: Pippinn subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 56 months! 
[1:20:11] Rizec: on the store is way worse then on twitch
[1:20:16] Morfoick: Destiny 2 has an item in the game where you grind each season to level it up. GIves you seasonal traits/mods/etc. It's a good system.
[1:20:20] Recording_on_the_grass: towRee
[1:20:24] Longiboi: I hope its anything but mount... there is no worth if every1 has the damn thing
[1:20:25] Badziee: I take that mount, no worries
[1:20:26] Onyxx666: I love event mounts tho that you needed to be involved in something to get
[1:20:27] szble: people are lucky the store isnt like ff14 they could be making bank
[1:20:28] HaxzorJimDuggan: the horror, being forced to watch a strimmer for mounts
[1:20:31] abracka_: people lost their shit when they added 10+ year old store items for twitch drops. imagine a mount
[1:20:34] looney199725: i still want the have the legendary cloak effects from mop as backpack skins
[1:20:37] mavericks312: i told my guild about the twitch drops and like 5 of them were like wtf is twitch
[1:20:46] sliproach: Dragon PEPE costum
[1:20:53] Kakotan2143: @Towelliee How do you switch between profession TOOLs and our Weapons in Dragonflight, i couldn't figure that out
[1:21:02] bigcathexed: What r u running this raid for?
[1:21:03] abracka_: smooth brain hours, forgot it was a prime reward
[1:21:03] m0rith: m0rith subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 33 months! 
[1:21:04] frenzoll: T-mogs. Maybe titles…
[1:21:10] TheCakeBadger: twitch is like only fans right? Im new
[1:21:25] Bogzeh: if the drops are good LUL if its a pet or something nah
[1:21:25] looney199725: @TheCakeBadger haha im dead
[1:21:53] KaisenSiru: triUhh
[1:21:56] Greneer: @mavericks312 are you raiding with 60+ people? xD
[1:21:58] TweektheProphet: Do you have a list of where you are going to farm your mounts each week or do you just know over the years at this point
[1:22:00] Onyxx666: cool kids only drops
[1:22:06] Hupu_a: What would the title be "lurker" or "coutch potato"
[1:22:06] Kelticlore: @towelliee at the start of mop i thought maybe the sha touched weapons would of been upgraded to legendary with the questline cause of the sockey and jewel we got for it
[1:22:09] Greneer: 60 yeas old
[1:22:11] Bogzeh: wow players who never seen twitch are in for a shock LUL
[1:22:14] mavericks312: @Greneer actually some of them yea lol
[1:22:14] Moobot: Details for DF Beta https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/details/files/3974119
[1:22:23] HaxzorJimDuggan: twitch drop for the "Randy" title in retail and "Candy" title in classic LUL
[1:22:25] TheAverageGoob: You know what would be REALLY cool? 20 slots added to our default bag space :O
[1:22:28] ashwing_: If its only certain then it would be ass for sure
[1:22:28] szble: i can already smell the forums
[1:22:30] NonGloriaFero: Get ready for the span of comments asking you why they haven’t got their drop yet LUL
[1:22:54] captiv8: maybe a twitch themed transmog drop????
[1:23:11] Kakotan2143: Cause Warcraft has never done this with Twitch until now, they are a little late to the game on this stuff, I hope it changes how much Warcraft works with it.
[1:23:13] Kakotan2143: There is
[1:23:14] Morfoick: there is
[1:23:14] looney199725: there is

[1:25:58] Kakotan2143: @Towelliee You cant reconnect for a few days now, something like that or like several hours you have to wait
[1:26:00] Sibo86: i dont see the option for battlenet

[1:29:52] mavericks312: no thats wrong
[1:29:52] honkblarg: its up till nov 14th
[1:29:53] zeeAbe: XP Buff goes away with Evoker
[1:29:54] rudi_cule: no its on 15th
[1:29:54] maclain67: Buff is around til the 15th
[1:29:55] Zilberg: Winds of wisdom doesn't leave tomorrow
[1:29:55] luckfore: it stays till 15th
[1:29:55] king_bam03: nope

[1:29:59] erasum: 15
[1:29:59] morp1onz: It is up until nov 15th
[1:30:00] king_bam03: 15th that goes
[1:30:01] ohprawinspree: they should just keep the buff
[1:30:01] wildheittv: no... it goes away on the 15th with evoker release
[1:30:05] ElmSpace: no it goes away with the dracthyr
[1:30:11] Bogzeh: is the chromie time up to 60 up tomorrow?
[1:30:15] Crisis88: Evokers are not tomorrow?
[1:30:18] HaxzorJimDuggan: ah nice wanted to level a paladin alt but wanted new talents
[1:30:21] captiv8: LFR is gonna be filled with Evokers LOL
[1:30:22] rudi_cule: lvl you cow rogues boys
[1:30:23] Morfoick: Chromie Time is 11/15 too
[1:30:27] rudi_cule: your*
[1:30:30] Fioray: So many alts to level, so little time.
[1:30:30] zeeAbe: But also when Evoker comes out we get reworked leveling which is basically the same as leveling right now with the buff towDance
[1:30:31] Bogzeh: lul
[1:30:32] organicsungrown: @towelliee are you excited for df and do you think arena will get better in df
[1:30:36] Aervyper: when is launch anyways?
[1:30:36] hippieh8rlol: that was also stated before they announced the 2 part pre patch
[1:30:51] luckfore: exp nerfs wont be in till 15th too
[1:30:53] QQisLIVE: press 1 if you never plan to level in shadowlands again LUL
[1:30:55] Kakotan2143: NO @Towelliee it was the GAME BAR, it is an annoying in-your-face background thing that causes too many issues, the Xbox game pass doesn't cause those issues
[1:30:57] Morfoick: wouldn't be surprised if shadowlands isn't included in the base expansion until 11/15 too
[1:31:02] Infebdo: It's most efficient to get lvl 50 before the 15th then go for 60 with reworked values.
[1:31:03] TweektheProphet: pre-patch added like a auto 10% for goo for lvl does it not. i thought i saw that it was going to be fast to lvl 1-60

[2:02:38] KaisenSiru: Method has Frag now Pog
[2:02:38] zeeAbe: But if you do too much splits and the raid is easy enough, you are gonna shoot yourself in the dick and lose the race

[2:04:15] WundertueteGER: @Rottencoarse but gingi isnt raiding in the first raid for them and deepshade left
[2:04:17] profplur: Gingi went on family vacation for a week or so, it created a dynamic that people created rumors that he was leaving
[2:04:38] Rottencoarse: @WundertueteGER  he said he'll be raiding? deepshades is taking a break from wow
[2:04:46] erasum: @Towelliee yeah they picked up a few people from peaces, like their RL

[3:12:59] bigshovels: but that percentage means nothing
[3:13:14] aMoteofCosmicTruth: I'm all in for delaying it if they need more time, but it wouldnt make sense if they do that since they sorta rushed with announcing it and doing the alpha/betas + announcement earlier than expected

[3:13:49] Mecabeast: maybe it's to compensate for an expected low q1 in 2023?
[3:13:50] lumjicsgo: if they delay shadowlands and delay dragonflight aswell it's gonna be such a bad look
[3:13:54] Namtarts_TV: i think its like over a year away from finishing
[3:13:58] troeffle: @Donzie you bought wrath? it was free how did you buy it ?

[3:19:46] Gravy_Gator: borrowed power sucks
[3:19:47] Noshpan: DF looks promising, but I also said the same about SL & WoD
[3:19:47] HairyAreolaus: I’m sure the prepatch is the determining factor whether it gets delayed or not.

[3:20:38] UltraContent: some dragons powers would be nice and need to be said that some "borrowed"! power are not borrowed at all cuz they stayed from covenants, like the hunt mindgames ecc.
[3:20:39] Zilberg: The raid is so good. Those bosses are amazing
[3:20:43] NBK_Sethus: we had the borrowed power currency for 3 expansions in a row, huge relief
[3:20:44] Scavosky: @towelliee are prot pallys looking good for DF? Or do I swap?

[3:21:56] Kedemel: D4 is gonna be grindy as fuck and I love it. The beta has been so exciting.
[3:21:57] feherlofia123: @zilberg yes
[3:21:58] Gravy_Gator: I don't see a problem with being "done" with a character for a short period of time cause you can play other games rather than play a single games 8 hours a day just to be relevant.
[3:22:01] BlackCl0ud: this game has my soul man, i keep casually coming back to it
[3:22:05] bypized: DF is so casual they added the AUTOPLAY button
[3:22:06] Noobicron: can i auto run mythic + on mobile app?
[3:22:09] trailerparkkgamer: seeing the popularity of Wrath id say that style will be popular

[3:23:00] BlackCl0ud: did you guys notice that Eeillewot  spelled backwards is Towelliee? that's crazy omg Kappa
[3:23:01] Donzie: The casuals spend more money than the 5%
[3:23:07] Darkfire2233: If the game is fun they spice up mythic+ and the raids continue to deliver people will play bc the game is actually good
[3:23:13] Korupcija_: do you know if "experimental gameplay" is for classic or retail?
[3:23:14] Zilberg: It’s not long probably 12-15 hours @vegetathagod
[3:23:14] Darkfire2233: not bc they feel like they have to
[3:23:16] Amarlian: I think the talent revamp makes it harder for borrowed power ideas honestly. It had to take a lot of brain power to come up with all of the talent points. @Towelliee

[3:24:20] MOXP: Is DF going to be alt-friendly?
[3:24:21] MethmM: :D
[3:24:27] CatfishTrout: Do you think there will be enough to do to play 40 hours per week still?
[3:24:28] BubbaChubbs420: towelliee is the top 5%
[3:24:35] mcgrady240: yeah you keep saying casual but that seems to be the average player now
[3:24:40] vegetathagod: @Zilberg you think it'll be viable to do in a group or go solo
[3:24:46] king_julian_96: how do you think the fated raids and mythic plus will go this week towelliee with the new talents
[3:24:49] MOXP: I'd rather play all classes then if each class only takes 8h per week
[3:24:52] NonGloriaFero: My main ask from an expansion is I want to be done with a character at a point. So I can move to an alt worry free
[3:24:53] crumbler81: I'm loving wrath, so DF sounds awesome too

[3:25:54] rudi_cule: you got your cow rogue name ready for tomorrow ?

[3:26:27] d00dledan: blizz is going to have a busy two weeks of fixing lol
[3:26:38] CatfishTrout: You said that 8 hours per week should be fine... do you think there will be enough to do for those who have time to grind?
[3:26:40] FlatulentFish: Whats that sweet stat panel up the top left?
[3:26:42] its_yegs: I have a 3 months old and I don't have too much time to play. The fact that I don't have to spend to much time and still be powerful is great for me

[3:28:06] zeeAbe: @Towelliee official quote is: "After Season 4 ends, all Shadowlands Raids will become Fated permanently until Dragonflight launches."
[3:28:10] rudi_cule: slime mount sucks cant even fly
[3:28:10] Zilberg: KSM should be easy then since talents buff you hard af
[3:28:19] Fadaar: its not my name, for some reason i decided to name my warlock that. i was *SHOCKED* when it went through.
[3:28:29] bypized: So this week you can still do KSM?
