[0:15:55] sohappy_yeet: did you see stv event nerf?
[0:15:59] wprogress: They have to make it solo only tbh
[0:16:03] mordiell: @TX_Mandalorian BabyYodaSip
[0:16:08] leonkoowsky: Hello Guzu
[0:16:14] Mabbio1111: please explain what that is @Guzu
[0:16:34] TX_Mandalorian: kek
[0:16:35] Ticklezao: om
[0:16:40] LabyrinthMW: How is he insta respawning
[0:16:41] Mabbio1111: LUL
[0:16:42] Ticklezao: they ruin the game for themselfs
[0:16:42] mordiell: YEP
[0:16:42] dizze1988: true
[0:16:44] JohnDoe79: yes
[0:16:44] D_Calles: LUL
[0:16:45] Chukky1123: Perm ban those people instantly....
[0:16:47] mediana91: that looks way more fun that mindless grinding
[0:16:48] trez_: YEP
[0:16:49] maxburty: lmao true
[0:16:50] its_me_: this kinda idiots got reward gain nerfed now
[0:16:50] Scusio: that is just mandkind though
[0:16:51] sohappy_yeet: the event never was fun to begin with tbh
[0:16:54] twitchforgotmyaccount: Odd that they didn't put in even a 5s cooldown on respawning.
[0:16:54] northern__soul: 100%
[0:16:57] mordiell: @LabyrinthMW think hes on respawn, the spirit healer thingy
[0:16:58] Vapp3: its not an exploit though
[0:17:01] Vapp3: its intended
[0:17:02] Djinx_o: junkie behaviour :O
[0:17:02] neruk887: imagine having fun and not min max. thats pure horror
[0:17:05] Nikoftz27: peepoTalk
[0:17:13] TX_Mandalorian: you are correct, wow players do not want to have fun (horde) madsMald
[0:17:20] LuminescentLlama: dammit man, basically gdkp without gold
[0:17:23] Dildozer68: heyy
[0:17:27] ZjakalGames: Guzu POV -> No runes, no levels, 1x sleeping bag EZ
[0:17:28] neuroxin: To be fair there there's not a lot to gain from win trading. All of the blood moon rewards are pretty easily obtained just playing normally. min maxing by win trading isn't saving you a ton of time
[0:17:30] ewilgodtv: They should make it like if u die 5 times in 2min you don't give coins
[0:17:31] Nikoftz27: heyy Dildozer68
[0:17:36] gretesponni: They already fixed it
[0:17:36] Vapp3: its not abuse though. its how the event works
[0:17:39] face_the_abyss: not an exploit then
[0:17:40] its_me_: they put a 1 min timer
[0:17:40] gretesponni: 1min timer
[0:17:41] ZjakalGames: @Dildozer68 UgWave
[0:17:43] MrAarickan: Theyve fixed it
[0:17:46] Nethylol: they put a 1min debuff
[0:17:46] tailech: @Vapp3 Denthey
[0:17:47] rashty92: hello!
[0:17:47] mediana91: there are some easy solutions. add a cd on getting coins from the same player, maybe 10 minutes or even 5
[0:17:47] NorreN8: How didnt blizzard think of that????? Such an ez exploit
[0:17:47] Nyxblow: Just make it that you can't kill guild mates
[0:17:52] Djinx_o: no coins after 1 killl
[0:17:52] TheL0m0o: can you raid in phase 2 or or no one will let you to cuz you missed phase 1?
[0:17:54] Brlskull: https://7tv.app/emotes/64d7ef64b0552f709e06ded5

[0:18:01] trez_: yap
[0:18:05] TX_Mandalorian: *cough* ban Horde *cough* madsConvert madsTo madsRaid
[0:18:05] LuminescentLlama: how would you deal with someone playing your game and giving you 20+usd to play the game per month? i doubt perma ban will be their fix
[0:18:05] iRayG2: w blizz reacting quick
[0:18:08] Brlskull: yap
[0:18:10] ZjakalGames: yap 󠀀
[0:18:10] Dildozer68: Nikoftz27 ZjakalGames  hugg
[0:18:17] ZjakalGames: Guzu POV -> No runes, no levels, 1x sleeping bag EZ
[0:18:17] Zargath_: Alliance pulling ashenvale boss into the water Kappa
[0:18:25] ZorsStream: easy fix: player's aren't worth coins if you killed them within the last 10 minutes
[0:18:25] leonkoowsky: Hello Guzu, can you tell me which zone i can lvl best with lvl 25?
[0:18:33] Varjant: they hotfixed it thankfully, now its just a lot slower
[0:18:35] tailech: yap
[0:18:42] jannoschh: they fixed it, now u are unworthy 1min after u died
[0:18:44] its_me_: its no longer easy with groups of 5 camping hard
[0:18:48] TX_Mandalorian: For real though, its all Horde fault
[0:18:50] sohappy_yeet: now it is KEKW exploit early exploit often
[0:18:54] ZjakalGames: @SupaMegaAttacke hard to design something for a playerbase of retards abusing anything
[0:18:59] Chukky1123: they should still ban those players

[0:19:14] ZjakalGames: !focus
[0:19:14] StreamElements: Guzu used autofocus 330 times!
[0:19:19] twitchforgotmyaccount: Dunno, I think the constant respawn carnage was fitting for the event. Blood for the blood god
[0:19:19] iRayG2: I heard slam is really good on warriors now! is that true?
[0:19:19] rashty92: did you saw Xaryu duel with boomkin clip?
[0:19:20] H1manu: guzuHands
[0:19:20] TheL0m0o: can you raid in phase 2 sod if you missed phase 1?
[0:19:25] ZjakalGames: Guzu POV -> No runes, no levels, 1x sleeping bag EZ
[0:19:26] TX_Mandalorian: true, facts
[0:19:26] Guzumerchmanager: @ZjakalGames YEP but also abit naive from bllizard to not know its own audience :)
[0:19:27] regularpers: take all the rewards from them
[0:19:30] notzaux: I mean win trading shouldve been the first thought before they released the event
[0:19:32] H1manu: @ZjakalGames LUL
[0:19:34] rashty92: he was globaled
[0:19:34] Brlskull: exploit early and often, people who didnt do this need to do 20 events for epic weps
[0:19:37] northern__soul: so they spoil it for others obviously they not lovers of classic
[0:19:40] cryptotoownage: good afternoon! nice hoodie
[0:19:41] neruk887: sure you can. killed 1 person at event around 100 times in time x - ban. just a db script
[0:19:46] mordiell: @TheL0m0o yes, you can still find groups for bfd probably too
[0:19:50] inst1nctCS: Guzu I got a 2H axe with my shaman now, how do I best train weapon skill?
[0:19:56] TheseDaysLIVE: I got epic dagger after 2 games KEKW
[0:20:00] trez_: YEP
[0:20:02] neruk887: ye exploite
[0:20:04] TX_Mandalorian: Can we talk about that time you died on your Warlock in Hardcore?
[0:20:09] rashty92: 33 lvl now, got eclipse rune, its... fcking broken

[0:23:37] TX_Mandalorian: i will fuck you up in pvp
[0:23:41] rashty92: problem with attack power class is that with more crit, they will run off from casters, as they dont get any haste
[0:23:42] LuminescentLlama: pallies are new meta
[0:23:45] TX_Mandalorian: Holy Paladin HYPE

[6:03:33] Meltim: @Meltim yeah exactly like that. different layers
[6:03:38] saren_x: PepeHands surely i'm worth SOMETHING at least...
[6:03:41] Moo360: basically everyone got all their items day 1 and then they fixed it but they get to keep their items
[6:03:47] Vapp3: exploiters win once again
[6:03:48] Harle13: debuff is such a bad choice thou
[6:03:48] Austyz: people who aren't worth points shouldn't be targetable. It makes the whole thing very messy
[6:03:50] Joxtirol: but you cant even corps walk any more
[6:03:52] angryhatter: they need to reset everyones coins
[6:03:56] dado_inc: boomkin good @ 40?
[6:03:57] angryhatter: no one should have the epics already
[6:03:58] ye1l: tahts not why though, it was a FFA at spirit healer
[6:04:01] ye1l: no exploit
[6:04:03] Rahmulous: Yeah and they didn’t revert any of the gains from exploiters and ruined any chance of loot for the rest of us. Blizzard overreacts and fucks up again.
[6:04:06] ye1l: just ffa and people got items fast
[6:04:07] Harle13: couldve done a better route to reduce exploitation
[6:04:08] xelm_: whole event seems confusing & annoying
[6:04:11] lurker_0o: 2m rez timer in a pvp event is cringe af

[6:04:53] ScootSmith: cant you mount here?
[6:04:56] lukepilgrim23: There a epics U can get? Wtf
[6:05:00] sohappy_yeet: @Rahmulous tho it wasnt an exploit: exploit early exploit often still stands strong with blizz
[6:05:01] F1reline: Good luck getting it done as warrior then
[6:05:01] wisenot: nah small groups are the best pvp
[6:05:03] angryhatter: solo players should be auto world buffed
[6:05:03] xelm_: 20% less dmg
[6:05:06] LillaJeon: Imagine a FFA battle royale kind of style, would be sick
[6:05:06] gatshaman: if you're in a group you can only rpwalk
[6:05:10] Vapp3: but you can group without grouping tho
[6:05:10] lukepilgrim23: Are they good?
[6:05:11] Ceodewd: ScootSmith With what?
[6:05:11] Joxtirol: nah just like raid
[6:05:13] calabrianchile: or a buff to being alone
[6:05:14] Meltim: could be fun if only solo. like no grouping allowed
[6:05:18] RAM__: I was only interested in FFA, group pvp is aids
[6:05:18] Colddaylight: You found the rune @Guzu?
[6:05:19] Kosmonaut23: healers would be complately f'd if they had to solo
[6:05:24] drummond777: 10% less damage per player in group
[6:05:27] saren_x: GuzuSniffa
[6:05:30] GrayFace_no_Space: -20% coins for every group member

[6:05:34] its_me_: they are all druids you are dead
[6:05:34] Nosk90: SNIFFA
[6:05:38] Huertix: GuzuSniffa
[6:05:41] ScootSmith: @Ceodewd mount from ashenvale? thought maybe sense its pvp zone
[6:05:42] kisaness: @Rahmulous They went the easy way. But what do you expect of a company that fired the whole support? You need real people to fix it, but then you have to pay them and lose some of that juicy juicy money
[6:05:43] jimmysnarkalots: o7

[6:30:47] thefoxborough69: You should be untargetable for 30s after spawning YEP

[6:32:14] catbalou2: I want them to make it OPT IN...not OPT OUT on normal servers!!!!
