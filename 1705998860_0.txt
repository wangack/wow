[1:34:59] Ertra: that fights hard for most healers
[1:35:13] UpSlash: He should be doing the fire breath thing, but that fight is very healing intensive
[1:35:26] dutchie76: sha and that boss are probably that hardest for healers eh?
[1:35:35] Sweet_Lou__: I'm sorry but for 17 years I got yelled at for doing DPS as a healer. So i never ever do
[1:35:40] Ertra: fire breath would give him some extra healing/dmg mix,
[1:35:46] Ertra: assuming they're spec'd into it
[1:35:48] OG_Carroll_4L: your healer is healing with his tongue out of his mouth trying to keep those dps boys alive
[1:35:49] UpSlash: I did a 19 Temple and the healing check on the last boss was rough

[1:37:41] Sweet_Lou__: I'm sorry but for 17 years I got yelled at for doing DPS as a healer. So i never ever do. that has been the number 1 reason I keep hearing Healers won't DPS at all. I'm a little too old to get yelled at for doing my job and theirs bc I used to be a team player lol
[1:38:00] WizzardMac: !notes
[1:38:09] UpSlash: I get yelled at for NOT doing dps as a healer

[1:39:09] UpSlash: lol
[1:39:10] geokouts: so you mean to tell me to nerf tanks???
[1:39:16] SilkeySmooth: why play dps if tanks do more damage?
[1:39:38] Sweet_Lou__: and that's why I stopped healing completely. I rather just tank or DPS and not have to be THE ONE responsible for people dying due to their sheer stupidity or ego
[1:39:49] Inthezonewow: Just use 5x Prot Warrior
[1:40:08] abracka_: they reduced the max public work order limit from 20 to 4 lol
[1:40:09] abracka_: wtf
[1:40:11] SilkeySmooth: just stack prot tanks no need for dps
[1:40:55] SilkeySmooth: balance
[1:40:57] Sweet_Lou__: and it's a shame too because I love to heal. I take it MAD personal when a MFer dies. But it's not worth it in the end with how ppl are

[1:54:25] thebakeriscomingforu: instead of nerfing lariat blizz could just make the other necks good.
[1:54:56] beatdooown: @thebakeriscomingforu Lariat will still be better than anything else
[1:55:05] Molvonos: @thebakeriscomingforu The fact that the Embelishment procs off gem slots is what makes it so much better

[1:56:04] dutchie76: @beatdooown yea i main MM hunter

[1:57:25] brozzy: None you just get a charge
[1:57:25] aggronautdh: maybe primal chaos?
[1:57:25] porchrocker: @niteshadeztv lol yeah it’ll prob be a while before I do that
[1:57:28] thadrewski: so everyone is going to have tier sets?
[1:57:30] TheItalianStallion321: IMO, sounds like there is no currency. its just 1 piece a week
[1:57:30] VikingArts: im guessing primal chaos
[1:57:31] brozzy: zero currnetcy
[1:57:45] beatdooown: @dutchie76 will be interesting to see RWF if roger plays MM still
[1:57:47] dutchie76: probably none
[1:58:00] neverbornlucky: towelliee you hear more old folks ending up in hospital cause they get weed ediables and eat the whole bag not just one gummy
[1:58:05] dutchie76: @dutchie76 yea i saw he switches to BM
[1:58:08] SilkeySmooth: zero currency
[1:58:17] Crowargus: valor cap being removed with catalyst?
[1:58:21] faulen: Essence of the Storm is probably the currency
[1:58:22] dimofodi: NGL I wouldn't think I could convert a crafted item with an embellishment could be made to tier and retain the embellishment.
[1:58:27] Aegllor: If you crafted a tier slot you weren’t forward thinking
[1:58:28] Thoreya: catalyst shoulda been last week
[1:58:35] dutchie76: valor cap should be removed
[1:58:42] beatdooown: Hunter is fucked with DT gone. We have shit survivability as it is and you take away our dps proc
[1:58:46] SilkeySmooth: so you want p2gear tier sets?
[1:58:50] Thoreya: @dutchie76 yup
[1:58:51] Molvonos: There's legit no real reason to make crafted gear then.
[1:58:54] jerseyfive: craftet gear would solve the professions problem. professions gear is useless unless its from the super rare recipes almost no one got...
[1:58:55] faulen: Essence of the Storm, a new currency used to purchase Storm's Fury rewards.
[1:58:57] TheItalianStallion321: yes. valor cap needs to be removed already
[1:58:57] Naganick: 6 uses feels bad as well
[1:58:59] Molvonos: Unless you're fillling BIS stats
[1:59:00] TheItalianStallion321: its fuckin dumb
[1:59:04] Senthius09: catalyst should have been as soon as raz died on mythic
[1:59:09] dimofodi: Catalyst should have been 1 week after raid opened. There's NO REASON we can't get tier quickly.
[1:59:09] dutchie76: yea double tap then rapid fire was awesome for aoe
[1:59:41] Ispintowin: I saw on the wow’s instagram that the trading post is gonna come out on February 1st @towelliee
[1:59:41] dutchie76: as soon as mythic race was over they should uncapped valor
[1:59:55] Thoreya: ya
[1:59:56] dutchie76: yep
[1:59:58] Thoreya: post is feb 1
[2:00:04] dutchie76: nah saw that on twitter
[2:00:04] dimofodi: Yep their post sys Feb 1 under it.
[2:00:05] OvertConcept: It’s Feb 1
[2:00:05] relaption: yeah its feb 1
[2:00:06] mavericks312: they still want you to go to the raid an m+ catalyst week negates that
[2:00:06] naznarens: ye feb 1
[2:00:10] dutchie76: its in Feb
[2:00:19] mavericks312: week 1*
[2:00:24] beatdooown: Catalyst is going to be useless for most people at the time of its release
[2:00:27] dutchie76: no
[2:00:30] dutchie76: one is blue
[2:00:35] faulen: I bet is Essence of the Storm that is used in the catalyst.
[2:00:36] dutchie76: LUL
[2:00:42] dutchie76: read the post lol
[2:00:48] thebakeriscomingforu: Although I had read that we get bonus trading tender as a thank yuo.
[2:00:49] TheItalianStallion321: @beatdooown sadly, it isnt for me. my main still does not have 4 pc
[2:00:59] mavericks312: @beatdooown not true how many casuals do you think have tier
[2:01:03] SilkeySmooth: zero shaman changes dead class
[2:01:06] Ispintowin: Did they nerf prot pally because I have not been on the past week @towelliee
[2:01:16] beatdooown: @beatdooown You still have 2-3 weeks
[2:01:27] dutchie76: buffed feral
[2:01:42] peinen: @beatdooown weird because the hunter guide writers in TSL say losing DT isn’t that big
[2:02:01] dutchie76: @peinen lol
[2:02:21] beatdooown: @peinen it makes the class unplayable at m+ and mythic progression
[2:02:36] jerseyfive: feral might be nice but think is balance is becoming meta again.. it probably already is LUL
[2:02:46] dutchie76: yea and they're moving talents around in that tree
[2:03:26] mavericks312: @beatdooown high end keys and mythic raids is a 1% problem though
[2:03:35] neverbornlucky: any warlock nerf?
[2:04:11] beatdooown: Somehow prot warrior still not nerfed
[2:04:12] Strik3r019: does any1 get internet  disconnects when they update curseforge addons?
[2:04:18] Thoreya: why would locks get nerfed
[2:04:32] MrIAmTrundle: is it going to cost valor to change in to tier sets?
[2:04:33] dutchie76: 30min spawn now too
[2:04:39] Molvonos: Chairs, you mean
[2:04:47] dutchie76: instead of 2 hours
[2:04:53] RicanGaming: Locks arent even S tiere there A at most
[2:04:58] cidthesloth420: oh that wa  is gnna be huge taking over so much of the screen
[2:05:00] Sarcastard: 389 max
[2:05:01] dimofodi: They will probably scale to the point of 380s to match those
[2:05:10] limburgse: Warlocks needs to get nerved in pvp, their healing from drain life is another lvl is insanity😅
[2:05:22] dutchie76: brackenhide hollow lol

[3:38:23] Dyasis: @ItsPetahhhh why? how?
[3:38:33] Teecay: Hey guys, I
[3:38:37] Alexm305: MARKED BY LIGHTNING
[3:38:50] Baron_Pandacula: it gives a buff and it changes gameplay beyond just making the dungeon harder
[3:38:53] Teecay: Hey guys I'm tanking M+ for the first time since playing WotLK but having massive anxiety. Any tips?
[3:39:02] ZeusDNA: If I felt the power of thundering, it'd probably be better. But when thundering goes off, I don't feel like I'm getting much considering the drawback to not clearing in time
[3:39:12] aimassistallen: you still time
[3:39:18] Dyasis: @ItsPetahhhh it changes 0 gameplay what are you talking about

[3:39:44] LoremasterMarthan: All of the non-current expansion M+s should just kinda be gimees
[3:39:47] ForgottenTime: This is ez time what you mean
[3:39:54] g0n_z3n: Odyn RP is 36 seconds
[3:40:16] ForgottenTime: Fair
[3:40:16] Sallypants: Which expansion is this dungeon from?
[3:40:28] ForgottenTime: Yeah playing near perfect should be a plus 2
[3:40:28] g0n_z3n: Legion
[3:40:32] Dyasis: @Sallypants legion
[3:40:38] Baron_Pandacula: @Dyasis i would say that having something that give you 30% damage and you have to clear it or get stunned changes gameplay
[3:40:50] neverbornlucky: could be worse towelliee. Was in a non -heroic regular dungeon at 67 on my warlock and a dps kept asking why do I keep dying. The tank finally admitted  was pulling to much. I just kept my mouth shut the warlock didn't die
[3:40:54] jerseyfive: @Teecay start low and work yourself up, in a +2 you are basically just there for show as fast as everything dies
[3:41:03] Snabido: Skovald being a real menace even in death KEKW

[3:43:03] JasperCalico: RLP +20
[3:43:05] MVPOFURGAMES: Again, tanks think they're stronger than they are and think they can pull a whole room just to have the group wipe
[3:43:05] Dyasis: 18 RLP  :P
[3:43:07] Scarhearth: Healers hate grievous weeks alot of times
[3:43:11] Mecabeast: tjs 18?
[3:43:13] brewsuadeshoes: I have an 18 Temple
[3:43:15] LoremasterMarthan: The amount of tanks I see play M+ like its a FFXIV dungeon and "wall to wall" pull is sickening lol
[3:43:16] OG_Fear: @Towelliee Throw up the temple Ill run it
[3:43:28] brand0nhxc: getting a compliment in pugs is so offguarding and unexpected so you gotta question it -_-
[3:43:36] Teecay: @jerseyfive yeah I've been doing some 10s but going higher is scaring me
[3:43:41] Maxoru0: I think it's the strat this week that tanks are doing, some don't know how to pull the mobs lol

[4:10:52] Buxtrr: thinking about re rolling to prot warr from fury just because it's seeming so hard to find a tank nowadays

[4:13:49] just_kirk_: Just get a few of us to run you around the Cobalt place for pwr lvling.
[4:14:01] Kalitvenec: TPFufun
[4:14:04] Heero_Effect: I’m not anti battle pass. Just think it’s funny that so many people don’t call it that.
[4:14:07] kaizendart: the mounts aren't shared between subscriptions
[4:14:29] kaizendart: oh wow
[4:14:58] paniczer0: so. I get mythic key stone to 9 or 8 and I'm getting geared players from 389+, but everytime we get in they are dying left and right and then we don't beat the timer... should I require a voice comm? it's getting ridiculous
[4:15:04] LuhZooka: I would like to see key binds on other wow players. I feel like my keys are spaced too far apart.
[4:15:12] aidonn: Always funny the one person who does not actually know, has to say its not possible
[4:15:18] JasperCalico: @paniczer0 def shouldn't need voice for 8s and 9s
[4:15:30] jasonbriggs: i have 3 accounts linked too the one battle net and all have same pets,mounts ,xmogs as my main
[4:15:32] strchsr: @Towelliee I think the only exception is accounts in different regions, like I have an EU account but it only has promotional mounts like the Feldrake or the proto drake from leveling a DK in Wrath Classic

[4:16:11] dschmidt: @paniczer0 its that bracket tbh - there is this like dead zone of keys where people think they can ignore mechanics on those because its "only an 8 or 9"
[4:16:14] Collected1: strchsr : oh yeah for sure it's regional.
[4:16:15] paniczer0: that's what I thought but. like halls of Valor. the tank didn't understand what keep the 2 beams separated and when they cast the special switch.. we told them 5 times then they left..
[4:16:19] NattyPally: tryna do a 20 halls after?
[4:16:39] Collected1: (i think)
