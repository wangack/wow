[8:56:52] Profanc: your character looks fucking amazing brother
[8:56:53] CoboTheGreat: as i said before when you play for the first few leagues its best to use a guide so you can learn the actual game mechanics before having to also figure out the technical aspects
[8:56:59] Urban_Zamboni: is this like escape from tarkov chat?
[8:57:05] Urban_Zamboni: thanks!
[8:57:08] Profanc: @Urban_Zamboni KEKW

[8:57:41] CoboTheGreat: @shigirakix wut...
[8:57:53] toki9k: It runs smoothly on most PC's no?
[8:57:56] MacaKiller: stone golem is quest reward from act 4 I think
[8:58:06] Profanc: are those wings expensive chat? i might start playing just for them
[8:58:09] CoboTheGreat: yea idk what youre on @shigirakix
[8:58:12] Urban_Zamboni: Blizzard should make a game like this
[8:58:13] GruncleEhv: hey shroud what do you think of the shield for the ogryn in darktide ?
[8:58:20] toki9k: Diablo 3
[8:58:26] JessuhTH: Is standard mode even worth it or does everyone just play the league all the time?
[8:58:35] OverlordAins12: @profanc 90$ only
[8:58:45] Profanc: @OverlordAins12 just the wings?
[8:58:48] CoboTheGreat: @JessuhTH most ppl play the league to keep things fresh, but theres definitely a community
[8:58:58] MacaKiller: @jessuhth go for the new league, fresh economy
[8:58:59] Ez_Fn_Pz: @JessuhTH after the league all ur stuff transfers to standard, most people just play leagues
[8:59:29] CoboTheGreat: @JessuhTH each league has its own mechanic that they are basically beta testing, if the community likes it they will try to incorporate it
[8:59:56] obetbangis: @internetfragger No. Path Of Exile.
[9:00:30] Urban_Zamboni: @anino6 is this escape from tarkov?
[9:00:32] JessuhTH: Aah thnx for the info
[9:00:36] CoboTheGreat: @JessuhTH this league has a rogue-like mechanic. Other examples are blight-tower defense, Delve-going down an endless mine with darkness=damage mechanics
[9:00:39] zaddrok: chat this or lost ark
[9:00:46] cptrumman: this
[9:00:47] SirEggman: i say this
[9:00:56] CoboTheGreat: wings in general are expensive af

[9:01:28] iBeep_uBoop: @Zardaa Why is it dumb
[9:01:36] cptrumman: what build are you planning to play ?

[9:02:09] ArcevFPS: tru fate I series part of my childhood
[9:02:12] Profanc: @cooking_nginamo not unless u count storage space
[9:02:21] RizenMuun: no maidens
[9:02:36] NebulaWaffles: and none of it gives u an advantage
[9:02:39] iBeep_uBoop: @Zardaa What happened?
[9:02:50] CoboTheGreat: @cooking_nginamo no, 95% is cosmetics and the 5% is stash space. If you really wanna think of it, the game is basically free trial but is about $30-40 buy to play to make your bank more manageable
[9:02:58] Profanc: mike have u ever played final fantasy 14?
[9:03:38] weebiscyr: Love u brother but the only I miss

[9:04:29] Urban_Zamboni: someone should make a game like this but you fight demons in hell
[9:04:30] Klubba22: Shroud, u should turn down the transparency on mini map so its easier to navigate/see
[9:04:42] the_real_jacobo: my buddy will clutch up and say he is going shroud.. what does that mean? lol
[9:04:44] CoboTheGreat: lol
[9:04:47] sp33dbean: drink hot chocolate
[9:04:50] CoboTheGreat: javajavajavajava
[9:04:50] bengalbroys: LUL

[9:04:52] SevenClad: shroudSip just had some
[9:04:53] tabrexs: WutFace decaff eww
[9:04:53] cactusvacuum: caffeine is good for you, drink as much as you like
[9:04:54] mutedscrxxms: only 3 cups?
[9:04:57] oofta_: not the same
[9:04:57] laccelo: it is
[9:04:57] Ez_Fn_Pz: 2 is just enough to want more wtf
[9:04:58] barfbuttburp: this*
[9:05:04] Profanc: door dash 1 to your window  hannah wont know
[9:05:07] BrianSmokes: Decaff is not acceptable imo.
[9:05:08] CyberBrandon: Rookie numbers
[9:05:09] shigirakix: Kappa
[9:05:09] Profanc: KEKW
[9:05:11] zeDominioN: 2 cups are rookie numbers my friend
[9:05:14] cptrumman: @shroud would you play CSGO back in the future ?
[9:05:20] subtoxiic: every cup of coffee reduces cancer chances by 15%
[9:05:26] alxgrld69: drink tea. its got less caffeine than coffee
[9:05:26] water_0_0: decaf is fine, go for it
[9:05:29] subtoxiic: one study showed
[9:05:33] kaboos101: what heppened to 3rd times the charm?
[9:05:39] Inriden: Relationships are all about comprimise, she may need to compramise
[9:05:45] BrianSmokes: I drink coffee like water. often in place of water, and to my own detriment, but it is sooo tasty.
[9:05:47] shigirakix: @subtoxiic doubt. i already know the bad effects to not ever drink it
[9:05:50] dmbott: Decaf is just dirty water - I drink loads of it every day
[9:05:54] SevenClad: just goin' GIGACHAD
[9:05:54] Profanc: hannah making u only drink 2 will make u crave it more KEKW
[9:05:58] Wooddyy: add more espresso until she gives in on the extra cup LUL @shroud
[9:06:02] mutedscrxxms: Momma didn't raise a quitter. I refuse to stop at 2 cups.
[9:06:06] ComanderJTC: Coffee flavored treats
[9:06:10] CoboTheGreat: @BrainPoptropica no, this game has infinite possibilities, which is amazing but also hard for new players. That being said imo if you wanna give it a try look up a build guide for some skill that looks cool to you and give it a go. Ask streamers for help if anything doesnt make sense
[9:06:16] subtoxiic: study was probably done by folgers though
[9:06:23] BrianSmokes: The trick is making your own coffee then you can make it as strong as you like.
[9:06:30] barfbuttburp: @CoboTheGreat thx
[9:06:54] Ez_Fn_Pz: A mocha isn't a coffee 5Head
[9:06:55] juicerknight: whats shroud build guys?

[9:07:21] kouykie: hyntuis subscribed with Prime.

[9:13:48] UNIONEAGLE7: yo
[9:13:56] DoomShallot: yeahhh, i just didnt know shroud was an old player, thought this was his first time
[9:13:59] TheGhillieBear: I recall playing the tutorial for this game and finding it dull but I‚Äôve recently started playing a game that seems similar to path of exile so I‚Äôll give it another go.
[9:14:16] cptrumman: @DoomShallot nahh hes very familiar with that game :D
[9:14:30] DoomShallot: cool cool
[9:14:33] CoboTheGreat: @TheGhillieBear by tutorial do you mean the acts?
[9:14:43] TheGhillieBear: Not sure tbh
[9:14:44] Fullnab: @shroud what happened with lost ark do you still play it?
[9:14:48] cptrumman: the first 5min its a tutorial
[9:14:49] Ez_Fn_Pz: @cptrumman i wouldnt say that
[9:14:52] Nategamer97: "out of no where"
[9:15:03] CoboTheGreat: @TheGhillieBear there is no true tutorial, ppl just call the story the tutorial cause they introduce you to mehanics

[9:16:11] cptrumman: Does Shroud will eventually play CSGO back in the future ?
[9:16:42] CoboTheGreat: @TheGhillieBear gotcha, now is a great time to start. Id suggest looking for a skill that looks cool to play and then find a guide for that skill
[9:17:00] CoboTheGreat: @FlyCreez best ARPG on the market
[9:17:01] alxgrld69: @cptrumman nah he broke his pinky toe and had to retire forever

[9:19:25] harleenquinzel9: is this free game or no
[9:19:32] cptrumman: free
[9:19:35] CoboTheGreat: @deatherdealer its honestly not as bad as it seems. If you wanna know everything sure. But to get to a point where you understand what your goal is and how your bulid works. Not at all
[9:19:53] Dea7hWolf: This is the better Diablo
[9:19:58] okju5t1n: So will Diablo kill POE
[9:20:02] Paka7_: POE in group is better to play than solo? Dont have any will to play it solo anymore
[9:20:04] deatherdealer: That build tree gives me anxiety @cobothegreat
[9:20:04] CoboTheGreat: i think ppl forget that you dont NEED to know everything
[9:20:04] okju5t1n: diablo 4*

[9:20:36] ikemaru__: There's a bit of a buy-in if you wanna play more than like 100 hours (stash tabs)
[9:20:37] alxgrld69: diablo 4 will just kill blizzard hopefully
[9:20:38] Nick_Jamez: this is the first time i seen him play this game
[9:20:47] Nick_Jamez: how is boosted so far
[9:20:47] CoboTheGreat: @deatherdealer each circle has a theme. axes/swords/two handed weapons, life, evasion. then its just how to get from one point to the next to get stats you want
[9:21:01] batman72: @CoboTheGreat you don't need to but it is very advantageous to know as much as possible.
[9:21:02] illusion_killz: skin's = win's everyone knows thats

[9:31:13] DonkeyBombGames: Animate weapon is such a cool spell in theory, and it's really powerful in very specific ways. Needs som love to diversify what you can do with it. IMO.
[9:31:26] SevenClad: pepeSmoke HUH MYAAA

[9:38:25] farmerdansdankgreenhouse: @Phoinex0 yes KEKW
[9:38:26] dakemi1218: what skill is buhh using?
[9:38:33] Stiriacus: poe has such a complicated skill tree i dont have the focus to get into it
[9:38:42] DoomShallot: @Phoinex0 its VERY hard to understand. but there are lots of good guides to help you as a beginner, until you understand more, months later
[9:38:51] VioletPoison_: return quests :D
[9:39:05] CoboTheGreat: @Phoinex0 infinite possibilities, lots of content, overwhelming, but can be managed if youre willing to give it a try
[9:39:08] farmerdansdankgreenhouse: the skill tree just looks complicated leveling most builds are similar
[9:39:15] itzBlaZn: Hey Shroud, will you make an appearance on Courage and Nadeshot show sometime?
[9:39:15] R3burg: skele mages was my favorite build ever and ive played for A LOT of seasons
[9:39:22] farmerdansdankgreenhouse: its only late game stuff where the tree is complicated
[9:39:25] Phoinex0: might have too try it out. ive played many games like it but the skill tree was always my biggest fear tbh
[9:39:39] AmbitiousMoose: Act 5 he doesn't drop items, i don't think so anyway
[9:39:56] farmerdansdankgreenhouse: the skill tree looks that way on purpose but its much simpler
[9:40:00] DoomShallot: @Phoinex0 yeah skill tree is intimidating, but a good guide will tell you exactly what to put your points in, and you dont even need to think about it
[9:40:11] itzBlaZn: That'd be cool. Timmy's interview was great!
[9:40:12] afrimearaf: !subs
[9:40:12] StreamElements: @afrimearaf, his sub count is at least 1 shroudKEK
[9:40:19] CoboTheGreat: @Phoinex0 its honestly one of the easier parts to learn imo, each wheel has a specific theme to it
[9:40:36] farmerdansdankgreenhouse: they make everything look super complicated that way youre proud of yourself 4Head
[9:40:38] Rupernac: so what is this game? it reminds me of a game i used to play called Fate
[9:40:45] plebichu: do it

[9:41:19] farmerdansdankgreenhouse: @DoomShallot agreed

[9:42:00] iSleepyxo: and its 5 am in eu, later today is gonna have double viewcount
[9:42:03] TRCK5TR: Well you had more viewers on Dragonflight launch date... It would be a more fair comparison
[9:42:33] DoomShallot: @shroud does your fps aiming skills help you with skillshots in POE?
[9:42:51] Gurss: yo thanks @robagreen
[9:42:52] meer92: oh shit shroud back on poe?

[9:44:00] Rupernac: tarkov is dead lmao not worth playing
[9:44:17] farmerdansdankgreenhouse: @qu1n70n you do need to spend at least 20
[9:44:24] tickomanuts: just tuned in, what cards is shroud talking abt?
[9:44:25] meer92: @qu1n70n there isnt really to be fair. i played first like 500 hrs with only buying 2 stash tabs worth like 10 bucks
[9:44:25] StreamElements: Check out Mike's Instagram account - http://www.instagram.com/shroud :D
[9:44:30] modshaters: tarky only for nerd who have no life KEKW
[9:44:34] itzBlaZn: Tarkov needs a 1.0 otherwise it'll be dead in the water
[9:44:34] kaitlynsmiles: @Rupernac wipe coming soon tho. im excited
[9:44:50] DoomShallot: i used to buy exalts for real money. but i'm reformed now

[9:45:25] farmerdansdankgreenhouse: id say you need to spend at least 40 really you need the currency tab
[9:45:29] ChubbyMikey: @modshaters ...he said, ignorant of the irony
[9:45:33] itzBlaZn: @meer92 Oh, true?
[9:45:58] farmerdansdankgreenhouse: and a quad tab

[9:46:42] 9tez: what game are they talking about?
[9:46:45] working_class_her0es: i think DMZ is bbetter than EFT
[9:46:50] itzBlaZn: No upto date on all that's happening.
[9:46:50] sxzoRRR: @tezrcx Roblex
[9:46:55] farmerdansdankgreenhouse: tarkov
[9:46:56] meer92: now i dont think its gonna be anywhere near optimised but i believe it will be a playable map with lots of new starter quests related to it
[9:47:06] Rupernac: tarkov just isnt the right formula to be a highly popular game for a long time. after w few wipes most people are tired of restarting.
[9:47:06] 9tez: all word word
[9:47:18] DoomShallot: for pubg, i just hide in a bush and watch anime until its me and the last guy. then i pop him and win
[9:47:40] Mr_Morepork: Have you tryd The Cycle? its like tarkov in space kinda
[9:47:43] itzBlaZn: Doc's new extraction shooter is coming along nicely. Saw some test footage recently, it has potential.

[9:49:33] bobbyexotic: Talking about a game with problems, look at Lost Ark!
[9:49:46] tukreb: @Rupernac @Rupernac more popular than Diablo :)
[9:49:49] ChubbyMikey: I think Ashes is gonna launch, do great, fall off as bad as New World did, but never recover at all
[9:49:54] Rupernac: @tukreb atleast POE has the free game going for it that will help it survive
[9:50:03] meer92: is that ghazzy?
[9:50:09] itzBlaZn: Honestly Tarky needs to take a page out of The Cycle's book. Significant improvements in anti-cheat
[9:50:32] mascapaia: I can't understand a thing that's on my screen OMEGALUL
[9:50:34] JarlArngrim: @shroud Hi Sir what u think on the  new Rainbow Six Season and the MUCH better anti cheat? would u step in?
[9:50:48] DonkeyBombGames: it's that first few days where nobody is a chad cause everyone has half an AK and a handful of shitty ammo.

[9:53:06] Galahad1012: !who
[9:53:07] Fossabot: @Galahad1012, He's playing solo
[9:53:15] stonedcaveman: What game!?
[9:53:19] itzBlaZn: With PVP MMO, there will be so many people complaining about pay 2 win, unless they can navigate around that
[9:53:21] ChubbyMikey: I think there WAS. But PvP focus games are dead on arrival these days
[9:53:26] Rupernac: @stonedcaveman the divison
[9:53:27] SuperMunchy: BDO so good and so bad facts
[9:53:31] Biddy_: @stonedcaveman ashes of creation
[9:53:32] eskrima_ian: I think AoC will be very great to casual players. specially it has tab element in its combat
[9:53:33] mascapaia: @iBeep_uBoop yes, the internet is a weird thing sometimes
[9:53:39] Galahad1012: @stonedcaveman Call of duty
[9:53:44] modshaters: MOD monkaS
[9:53:46] Dudaz_: @shroud ever try Darkfall? it had all the pvp systems and full loot it was awesome but died a horrible death
[9:54:00] crigflo: BDO was p2w as shit
[9:54:01] kiTTiponX11: have you ever make it to the end game bosses ?
[9:54:11] Romintar: i love the sound track of this
[9:54:16] OMEGALULOW2onSTEAM: is crazy to think the last time i enjoyed pvp was when neverwinter came out
[9:54:26] redrumJSN: same with run escape
[9:54:28] ezraeli_spy: osrs is king :)
[9:54:31] JarlArngrim: @shroud Hi Sir what u think on the new Rainbow Six Season and the MUCH better anti cheat? would u step in?
[9:54:36] bmeneguele: hey @shroud what builds are you both running?
[9:54:38] astrum_00: The issue is that I dont think PvP focused MMOs cant have major success nowadays
[9:54:44] jaykay44: it was so original
[9:54:51] Dudaz_: its because theres barely new mmo players, just old ones playing their same old game
[9:54:53] zwiche: darkfall was his fave
[9:55:07] 703Bugeye: warzone sensitivity?
[9:55:08] Holophonist: DARKFALL
[9:55:16] itzBlaZn: What WoW have done with the latest update/installment is what they should have done a while ago
[9:55:28] DonkeyBombGames: I honestly think it has a ton to do with the art with Wow. It's inviting to everyone.. where as only dragon rider skyrim bros want ESO.. if you know what I mean.
[9:55:37] modshaters: somehow when chat talk about pay 2 win game, i want to scream, you think game company is charity company KEKW
[9:55:40] ImAllOutOfBubblegum: Also, literally not a single game has the depth that WoW has. The sheer amount of content that game has is actually mind blowing
[9:55:46] subtoxiic: they are king because of how the character feels in the world and in combat imo
[9:55:49] 703Bugeye: !warzone sensitivity
[9:55:52] Draegenbaeg: ffxiv is pretty close
[9:55:55] eskrima_ian: New World's PVP was great. it's just went really stale at the end game. you got no reason to pvp at all lol
[9:55:56] spec1al: riot
[9:56:01] Boltron23: the talent
[9:56:08] expanda11: Riotgames MMO i think will be able to compete with WoW
[9:56:14] zwiche: they had no leadership
[9:56:20] KiddouJanse: whos this fool thinking amazon is giving infinite money lmao
[9:56:25] astrum_00: The nature of the MMO genre makes it nearly impossible to knock whatever game is at the top off
[9:56:28] subtoxiic: WoW just has the best recipe out there.
[9:56:31] eskrima_ian: @expanda11 same as other hundreds of mmo that came out
[9:56:37] OMEGALULOW2onSTEAM: @expanda11 and thats only cuz riot has been able to cultivate a follower. a love for all things riot relate. fandom if u will monkaS
[9:56:45] mascapaia: I'm excited for Riot's MMO
[9:56:48] LaytLight: They don't need to compete with Blizzard though.
[9:57:02] youluvz: so is this game about
[9:57:10] Boltron23: ashes of creating is another
[9:57:24] 703Bugeye: !sensitivity
[9:57:24] StreamElements: @703Bugeye, Looking for his sensitivity for a specific game? Type the game name and sens - like !valorantsens or !apexsens

[9:57:30] bmeneguele: what about lost ark? ......
[9:57:34] onetrickdefeat: yeah ashes of creating look really promising
[9:57:37] itzBlaZn: Honestly what developer could possibly come close to what WoW is, especially now.
[9:57:38] modshaters: @OMEGALULOW2 dont say the truth ma boy, you will got nuked by die hard fans KEKW

[10:23:21] FlamingFingers: Shroud is on POE? wtf insane
[10:23:25] CoboTheGreat: @Xomezor search "resistance" on the tree, theres typically a decent all res node near where youre pathing. Also look for gear from vendors that has the right colors/links + base type(armour/es/evasion) and try to use alchemy orbs or essences on them
[10:23:26] FlamingFingers: never knew he played this game
