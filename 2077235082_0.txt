[1:00:12] CircleSocialClub: these numbers mean nothing unless we define how we want to measure wealth. do we count property, pension, monthly salary ect
[1:00:24] yoshhiithebigman: I just looked it up "Since the adult US population is around 250 million, that means that just over 8% of Americans are millionaires. A new survey has found that there are 13.61 million households that have a net worth of $1 million or more, not including the value of their primary residence. That’s more than 10% of households in the US"
[1:00:34] Devilscancryy: Holly molly somepoeple are dumb/ 8% is 26 million people in america
[1:00:34] Nightbot: @kecesi -> You must be a Twitch Subscriber to send links in chat! [warning]

[1:00:53] AIM_the_Bulldozer: Idk but that is what it says
[1:00:54] Delfrain: @Devilscancryy it only counts adults
[1:00:54] The_Bear_U: google says the US has 22.7 million millionaires
[1:01:03] Witzz2: Maybe networth?
[1:01:04] CircleSocialClub: read a book
[1:01:05] kecesi: net worth
[1:01:05] FeldyTV: WAYTOODANK
[1:01:05] bmster64: fake
[1:01:10] Thewanderingplayer: KEKW
[1:01:11] dontstepo: It's net worth, not cash jesus
[1:01:11] kecesi: HAHAHAHAHA
[1:01:13] TR3Nzee: 1 milion dollars means you own a hause and a cat

[1:01:14] yoshhiithebigman: It's not a steady income tho it's there stockpile
[1:01:16] puxafreitas: adult population
[1:01:19] YuhZeptik: we just need 1 good president to turn things around but that good president was killed by the cia in the 60s
[1:01:20] puxafreitas: narrows it down a bit
[1:01:21] FeldyTV: WAYTOODANK he is right
[1:01:29] yoshhiithebigman: They have around 1 million bucks saved
[1:01:31] bmster64: net worth is feasible
[1:01:31] vacerss: probably assets included
[1:01:37] yoshhiithebigman: Not a steady income
[1:01:40] The_Bear_U: it says 22.7 million millionaires @TommyKayLIVE
[1:01:42] TR3Nzee: arent u a milioner too?
[1:01:43] r3d_rh1n0: Net worth also different
[1:01:45] Devilscancryy: propably networth
[1:01:46] Huntin_Dusty: only 1% of Americans are in the military
[1:01:47] matty_2599: i mean thats pension plus land and think how much land there is too right massive hosues, gardens etc
[1:01:54] vacerss: knowing how expensive houses are its probably true
[1:01:55] Witzz2: 10% is all the 80+ year olds
[1:01:59] yoshhiithebigman: I mean houses rn are in the millions
[1:02:00] nikola_gavric1: What is the average debt per adult citizen in US tho? Kappa
[1:02:01] bmster64: a house alone is about 500.000$
[1:02:02] Pokker_Gamer: yet theres so many homeless people
[1:02:04] retidio: They make a lot more then europeans
[1:02:09] retidio: On average
[1:02:13] causin_drama: that’s crazy I live in LA it doesn’t really seem like it would be that
[1:02:18] dontstepo: there is 40 million boomers in us
[1:02:28] reai_god: if they own a small buisness + house + car it could go above millionare pretty easily
[1:02:31] yoshhiithebigman: The houses they bought for liike 100 grand back then and now there worth millions
[1:02:35] CircleSocialClub: it makes perfect sense
[1:02:44] Noobf33: Just the housing market
[1:02:47] CircleSocialClub: yes
[1:02:49] YuhZeptik: in like NYC they are all over the place
[1:02:49] Liquidine: maybe 10% of millionares live in america?
[1:02:51] TR3Nzee: its quiet logical
[1:02:51] reai_god: i guess they define millionare by if you have 1million net worth
[1:02:52] Thewanderingplayer: 1 million dollars = 0.92 million  Euros btw
[1:02:55] nikola_gavric1: Just deduct debt and suddenly there is not so many milionaires in US
[1:03:00] Quicly123: American capitalism makes people rich, i wonder if europeans should start having 6 weeks of maternal leave and other proemployer laws
[1:03:00] CircleSocialClub: look up other sites, they will tell you the same
[1:03:02] yoshhiithebigman: The housing market made the old people super rich
[1:03:05] TR3Nzee: after 20 yeasrs of work u should be a milioner
[1:03:10] bmster64: owning 2 houses makes you a millionare
[1:03:13] AIM_the_Bulldozer: @TommyKayLIVE That is the thing in the us there are more people at the extremes of wealth, lots of poor people and slightly higher than average ammount of people who are millionares
[1:03:16] kecesi: @TR3Nzee ^
[1:03:18] FeldyTV: I was once in the US and remember that kinda every house had a freaking home cinema, whirpool and stuff LULW
[1:03:24] sofort_abbruch3000: accumulating wealth goes well with time so it makes sense old people are rich
[1:03:32] The_Bear_U: meanwhile "12.4% of Americans now live in poverty according to new 2022 data from the U.S. census" KEKW @TommyKayLIVE
[1:03:36] CircleSocialClub: now make that for 40 years :)
[1:03:39] bmster64: german socialism ftw
[1:03:42] puxafreitas: youre getting by that's what matters ehehe
[1:03:49] TR3Nzee: remember mos people worked for like 20 years too
[1:03:55] Devilscancryy: its not that they make millions, its probably they have 1 million in assets cause then it makes sense; owning a house already gets u half there
[1:03:55] kippy_pivki: whats the criteria for a millionare?
[1:03:59] Der_Allerechte_UncutNick: age builds wealth fr
[1:04:04] gooregonducks: Wow it’s WOW

[1:04:12] dontstepo: Skill issue Kappa
[1:04:16] garlicbrehd357: You need to invest in mutual funds and retirement.
[1:04:20] yoshhiithebigman: Most milioners in america are retired people
[1:04:28] kippy_pivki: @Pokker_Gamer but does that mean 1mil in your bank account?
[1:04:30] hussar1683: You are half a millionare then
[1:04:38] YuhZeptik: @TommyKayLIVE rothschild died so thats epic lowkey
[1:04:38] gltamt: generational wealth helps a lot

[1:05:39] gooregonducks: did you see Russia actually threatened nuclear war if nato sent any troops tommykDARK
[1:05:42] Koberinoo: The property is expensive in cities like LA so probably if u own a 2 bedroom apartment ur already half way to be a millionaire :D
[1:05:46] kecesi: @kippy_pivki a lot billionaires dont even have 1 mil in their bank, its easier to leverage assets
[1:05:48] hussar1683: In Germany it says that 3.9% are millionares
[1:05:52] gltamt: my dad doesnt have a single bank account in my country
[1:05:54] FrostBitey10: i remember when you did a wealth tax in democracy 4, all the rich people started leaving your country KEKW
[1:05:54] Shekel____: I can teach you that Kappa
[1:05:58] The_Bear_U: @gooregonducks shocker
[1:06:02] CircleSocialClub: Germany has a higher % of milionares 3.9 than Austria 3.7 🤔
[1:06:05] AIM_the_Bulldozer: Yeah I am happy that my grandpa owns a nice company and Ill inherit a percentage, but I legit feel a bit guilty
[1:06:15] FrostBitey10: did you see what scholz said today?
[1:06:24] hussar1683: Russia has 0.3% of millionares
[1:06:37] mulier_kommadant: people in Asia flee to places to not pay inheritance tax

[1:07:09] iGreffer: Do you have a stance on the agrarian revolt in eu?
[1:07:19] FrostBitey10: scholz basically was mad at france for suggesting troops in ukraine, and even said that there are already british troops in ukraine helping them fire rockets

[1:11:01] bmster64: the army is that place where an idiot gives orders to even more idiotic dudes
[1:11:11] Huntin_Dusty: When I volunteered for the Army, one of my NCOs said the Army was for ex cons and losers who couldn't do anything else @TommyKayLIVE
[1:11:19] heliumz: in the movie forrest gump, the sergeant calls forrest genius because he does everything he is literally told

[2:39:16] killjoymini: do you disc or holy priest more?, or in OSD are they both combined
[2:39:40] crazykman290: dispersion helps alot for mana issues, and +1 means people who havent won a roll get prio over someone who does

[2:40:08] Shinchandan: +1 is if you get loot you can't get another until others get it
