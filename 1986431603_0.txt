[2:13:16] dingpong22: your suppose to scare him and tell him he died
[2:13:21] Hamasta: Ah nice. Difficult to do in hc then
[2:13:40] DrAtomicPanda: @Hamasta just more on the line not really any harder

[2:13:57] SushiLaser: you look like a playa
[2:14:02] dingpong22: gnome pimp hat
[2:14:02] EngeltheFallen: the real danger is you need to keep 40 people paying attention and on task

[2:14:26] Radund01: Are y'all ready to die in the 40-man and lose all your progress due to pampered streamers?

[6:10:51] EngeltheFallen: i doubt it actually
[6:10:58] DrAtomicPanda: dral you play anything other than d4 lately?
[6:11:05] Centurion_Havoc: someone is going to bomb the raid 100%
[6:11:14] EngeltheFallen: we have two 20 man gold groups running smoothly
[6:11:27] Goldni007: 5mans r more dangerous than doing raids
[6:11:27] DrAtomicPanda: oops wow sub just renewed Keepo
[6:11:27] Draleric: Just HSR
[6:11:31] iBrisly: Hey @CobaltStreak, any advice for someone just starting wow? classic or retail? Too late in the game to even bother?
[6:11:48] EngeltheFallen: retail is an easier start
[6:11:50] SushiLaser: ive just seen a few too many baron geddon deaths LUL
[6:12:01] EngeltheFallen: and def not too late
[6:12:04] DrAtomicPanda: @Draleric i still havent done the monthly its not catching my interest
[6:12:20] Chewbracca: @iBrisly Retail is super easy to get into RN. THey just released a new tier and a ton of catch up mechanics for gear with it
[6:12:23] EngeltheFallen: new people start wow all the time
[6:12:24] Goldni007: the next patch for retail will have ai normal dungeons like how FF mmo works
[6:12:33] DrAtomicPanda: i did get into ZZZ that actually caught my eye
[6:12:54] EngeltheFallen: classic is a lot of fun, but more a grind
[6:12:58] Nightbot: Use this link to buy anything from Amazon to support Cobaltstreak -> https://tinyurl.com/cobaltamazon
[6:13:06] EngeltheFallen: classic is more about leveling
[6:13:17] EngeltheFallen: retail rushes you to the end - HC not recommended at all
[6:13:24] EngeltheFallen: some love it but it is pain
[6:13:49] Draleric: DrAtomicPanda I saw a bit of gameplay and it seemed ok I guess. I had no interest in HSR until I played it and maybe it'll be the same with ZZZ lol
[6:13:54] PacktSardine: its like you live on in a such boring heaven
[6:13:56] DrAtomicPanda: the only bad thing about retail wow for new players is they hit you with way to many skills at once if you havent been playing the game for a while you might get overwelmed
[6:14:15] EngeltheFallen: hunter was like that in classic
[6:14:21] EngeltheFallen: you just got slammed with shit fast
[6:14:37] EngeltheFallen: KEKW
[6:14:43] PacktSardine: KEKW ripbozo
[6:15:45] DrAtomicPanda: @Draleric tbh it seemed a lil boring until i started getting into more of the quests and got into the gotcha rolling (even though you cant spend money)
[6:16:46] bigdougie: are any dogs barking?
[6:17:07] flutten: 414 raiders from flutten have joined!

[6:20:52] underscoreFishy: who is doing all the shit talking - I can't tell most of the voices apart
[6:21:22] Ashj: if this shit goes south you are the last one to die(in this room) melee are the worried ones
[6:21:44] DrAtomicPanda: but anything sneezes on him it could be death
[6:22:13] nickwtfzorz: v the victims a osrs streamer
