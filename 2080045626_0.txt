[0:52:05] mealtiime: retail is chill

[0:52:23] MikeyPlan: are you playing cshero this phase?
[0:52:25] veiloflonelystars: Cata pvp is technical and engaging without being bloated like retail atm
[0:52:31] rikikikirikitv: @Ziqoftw any special reason why u dont play solo ?

[0:53:49] Duckduckgoose38: Naw. I only played it because I was bored of retail
[0:53:55] niku_baku: nah but will be fun to watch u

[0:54:01] NightMunchies: YOU'RE welcome
[0:54:03] kahones: dont think gdkps will be big in cata,,,isnt cata way harder to raid or something but i might be wrong
[0:54:05] jokaa199: how hard is it to find a gnome raid?
[0:54:08] pesopouch: theyre not gonna ban GDKP in cata because they make money from it with the tokens now
[0:54:08] veiloflonelystars: i did HC already so now just chilling with SOD and other games, play elden till p3 for now

[0:54:31] snowman56: they can also disperse while mounted which is stupid lol
[0:54:32] wreckstormx: sf*
[0:54:34] Razdruid: I mean boosting is technically a bannable offense but they don't really enforce it. so id doubt they would be that serious about it there @smaftyz
[0:54:43] body_type_two: then mages should be able to block while silenced on frost ppc
[0:54:44] delishe_ent: wait u can disperse while kicked on shadow?
[0:54:44] monogornn: firestar is paying a tribute to you , doing ssf with coward debuff
[0:54:48] HighTerms: disperse on a mount h

[0:55:57] Sleepylol93: The realms are so empty even NORMAL HC is like SSF
[0:56:01] eflainel: ssf is so bad

[0:58:48] HighTerms: like 6 months too late
[0:58:52] Ronafca: kinda sad pom pyro is 1 point out of reach
[0:58:57] iPlayCuzFun: @jhk97 so he's the ping king
[0:59:02] hot6auce: @Razdruid agreed, yesterday was epic and the games today are stacked.. liquid vs echo is gonna be wild
[0:59:04] wreckstormx: they probably knew no one would play it so they just did it on a server that already has some ppl maybe?
[0:59:06] MikeyPlan: that would've been cool but let's be honest, HC is low population enough as it is

[1:18:29] itsBdaws: @xd1ng0_ gatekeeping elitism and people being tired of the bullshit is why sods dying lol

[1:19:08] spexxi89: lvl 17 sham, hype
[1:19:09] Fluffin04: I've done bfd once every reset to lvl LUL
[1:19:11] nosefinger: dying cuz there is no more content LUL Once u have ab exalted from stv  event the only thing to do is raidlogging
[1:19:13] OptimusPrimePleb: FeelsTiredMan  nice bait
[1:19:18] iPlayCuzFun: very baised question
[1:19:21] SippinSimpSyrup: little bit of a loaded question
[1:19:23] Fluffin04: nope

[1:19:40] hystelios: @itsBdaws Sod is dying?
[1:19:44] jhk97: @nosefinger except world pvp
[1:20:01] jhk97: @hystelios thats news to me aswell, doesnt feel like its dying at all
[1:20:01] SippinSimpSyrup: sod dying Kappa
[1:20:09] nosefinger: most players wont farm wpvp 24/7 cuz no incentive to do so, they will just raidlog and play other games
[1:20:17] brewtank: @ziqoftw are you going for either of the STV mounts?
[1:20:30] wreckstormx: ive done gnomer since before the first reset and im still enjoying it, still need alot of gear too for some reason
[1:20:31] jhk97: @nosefinger well the incentive would be to have fun obviously, dont have to get anything for everything you do
[1:20:35] itsBdaws: @hystelios you read correctly but it’s only natural
[1:20:52] Messn3r: hes right you raid once a week and then you play elden ring rofl
[1:21:03] tomtabel: Are there coming a Sod tournament ?
[1:21:04] hystelios: @itsBdaws I read it correct doesnt mean its correct lol
[1:21:18] inspect4: 90% of psheros bg is rp walking in stealth
[1:21:23] wutfacesz: if youre a pve only player then raid logging makes sense
[1:21:25] iPlayCuzFun: @tomtabel yes but it was postponed for some reason
[1:21:28] Ronafca: @itsBdaws how it it dying? raidlogging is part of wow since forever
[1:21:32] tomtabel: @iPlayCuzFun Ahh okay
[1:21:34] jhk97: i dont really understand raidlogging, isnt playing an mmo way too much time investment to then play it for an hour every couple days?
[1:21:49] bennybe: Frostfirebolt buff in now?
[1:21:52] Ronafca: @jhk97 some ppl just like raiding
[1:21:57] biglongjohnsilver: guys i was addicted to wow hardcore and had to quit. but SoD is getting my attention. is it fun?
[1:21:58] padierman: i love all the gadgets
[1:22:03] sending123: u think they gonna add new pvp events later phases?

[1:22:10] wutfacesz: yes @biglongjohnsilver
[1:22:18] ChazGGaming: when is cata classic out
[1:22:19] itsBdaws: @hystelios yeah try and do a dungeon that’s not rfc or sm and you’ll be spamming for an hour
[1:22:22] bennybe: Frost specc back on menu after Frostfire bolt buff?
[1:22:24] jhk97: @Ronafca yeah i like raiding aswell, but if there was nothing but raiding every couple days, i dont think id pay the sub fee for that tbh
[1:22:25] neoseoul69: @biglongjohnsilver meh
[1:22:26] wreckstormx: i like raidlogging but i dont only play for that
[1:22:27] iPlayCuzFun: how that retail Q going lmao
[1:22:58] SBGTentacleMonster: i still dont understand what the frostfire and arcane frost bolts are supposed to be doing.
[1:23:02] Rawz1337: Cant even bugg range hunterr ^^
[1:23:04] SippinSimpSyrup: @bennybe no
[1:23:05] Rawz1337: buff
[1:23:10] tomtabel: Missed 4 shuffles already ;)
[1:23:11] hystelios: @itsBdaws cause everyone is max now that doesnt mean the game is dead lol
[1:23:13] Ronafca: @jhk97 a lot of ppl do, and a lot do it on multiple chars
[1:23:14] jhk97: @biglongjohnsilver sod is very fun
[1:23:40] iPlayCuzFun: @biglongjohnsilver stay away u will get addicted for sure
[1:23:42] DjPyro: @SBGTentacleMonster blizz is also - but cause theyre brainless and cant come up with new shit - they just recycle old useless shit KEKW
[1:23:42] wreckstormx: @jhk97 in phase 1, when i ran out of things i wanted to do i just played wotlk when i didnt raid
[1:23:54] Fuwahta: LUL
[1:24:14] itsBdaws: @hystelios if the game isn’t thriving at all levels meaning new players aren’t coming in and also a dwindling in player base log ins this phase but sure keep denying facts
[1:24:17] jhk97: @wreckstormx i leveled alts and did wpvp, until i had to reroll servers so im releveling alts, and worldpvping (inbetween raids)
[1:24:26] avidbtw: LUL
[1:24:27] Ronafca: i guess it depends on the person, i like being able to play sod and do what i want whenever want, rather than some fomo forcing me to log
[1:24:27] iPlayCuzFun: mages are broken tho haha
[1:24:27] Wrathbb1: does the proc rate increase based on number of targets hit with CoC?
[1:24:33] TCK999_: What do warriors get KEKW
[1:24:35] itsBdaws: @hystelios just cause u didn’t like what I said LUL LUL
[1:24:55] iPlayCuzFun: @TCK999_ give us more mid passives and 2min shouts pls
[1:24:56] SippinSimpSyrup: @iPlayCuzFun in what way?
[1:25:09] hobbehesu: I wonder how all these shamans in SoD are going to acces their hotkeys, seems like there's just no more room for anymore (with the totems taking up nearly all slots)
[1:25:19] iPlayCuzFun: @SippinSimpSyrup why mages are broken?
[1:25:24] Landotazo: @itsBdaws cAn'T dEnY tHe FaCtS
[1:25:25] hystelios: @itsBdaws Man its all good i just disagree that your personal anecdote doesnt mean the game is dead
[1:25:29] SippinSimpSyrup: yes, how are mages broken
[1:25:30] DjPyro: @SippinSimpSyrup he has no idea just stating the normie bs
[1:25:36] MarioTF2: warrior feels dead man
[1:25:36] BipolarPongal: Amazing casting as always, looking forward to tonight's games
[1:25:38] wreckstormx: @jhk97 ait, but yeah i get what u mean, u always see these ppl complaining about not having anything to do, like do something else then xD
[1:25:45] sebbebike: song?
[1:25:46] sebbebike: remix?
[1:25:49] acornsss: Mage farming on the STV alters is beyond fun
[1:25:58] iPlayCuzFun: specc or runes?
[1:26:00] itsBdaws: @hystelios dying and dead are different dummy learn critical thinking
[1:26:08] barkerdoa: YAY I got gifted sub!!!!!
[1:26:12] TCK999_: p3 Warriors rise
[1:26:19] cendrifione: you can win casters in frost
[1:26:28] SippinSimpSyrup: when i hear broken, i hear OP. i dont think mages are OP when you look at the pvp landscape of sod.
[1:26:28] Landotazo: @itsBdaws are you 12 years old? lol
[1:26:30] iPlayCuzFun: @TCK999_ will be fun
[1:26:38] jhk97: i completely forgot you were queued for that, that took long xd
[1:26:43] itsBdaws: @landotazo no?
[1:26:44] hobbehesu: I thought the Birthday Cake sponsored by Warcraftlogs was really cute btw, props to them
[1:26:46] nosefinger: if ppl are complaining about nothing to do then its not a player fault but a lack of development kekw imagine blaming the players for saying there isnt enough content. Never seen such copium logic
[1:26:59] Landotazo: @itsBdaws you sure chat like it
[1:27:07] itsBdaws: @landotazo pointless comment with no value
[1:27:12] Wrathbb1: @nosefinger are both your nose and finger all the way up blizzards butt hole? lmfao
[1:27:16] mrciannu: imagine playing sod when u can play football manager KEKZ
[1:27:17] jhk97: @nosefinger no youre coping, you got what you paid for and complain about not getting more.
[1:27:18] kvaelma: arenas pog
[1:27:19] tomtabel: 6/6 more gifted :P
[1:27:31] Makkek: chat, any idea if 100% xp boost is live on tuesday in eu? or wednesday?
[1:28:00] nosefinger: no we didnt u think stv event is well tought and good event with the lagg problems? and once ur exalted with ab and u clear gnomer every reset what else is there to do?
[1:28:05] hobbehesu: @Makkek Tuesday night/Wednesday morning is usually reset day for EU
[1:28:06] inspect4: @makkek eu reset is wednesday always
[1:28:06] dizze1988: hes not back =(
[1:28:11] neoseoul69: Wow that looked like so much fun
[1:28:14] nosefinger: u say wpvp but ppl dont go wpvp 24/7 with no reward or no reason to
[1:28:20] Twitchful_Duelist: at the gate

[1:29:09] inspect4: Ommicd is best addon for solo shuffle for sure
[1:29:10] nosefinger: its not insta lmao god  u guys are coping
[1:29:21] neoseoul69: @jhk97 brother full BIS comes from AH and gnomer
[1:29:35] jhk97: @neoseoul69 literally changes nothing about what i said
[1:29:48] hobbehesu: LICKA ?
[1:29:49] SongSongLol: the demon hunter instantly flies across the entire map and starts flapping around like a bird, looks solid
