[4:44:47] Jeuffrey: deliriumvoid that qould require 6 separate streams + 1 main stream. I would rather see WoW in-game promotion of arenas with free spectator mode. That way it wouldnt be such load on traffic, it would be in your local WoW game quality (max resolution and details) amd you could watch player you want. Also some UI overlay and sound stream could be added if you's like them to be enabled. @Warcraft
