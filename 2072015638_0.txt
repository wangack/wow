[3:25:41] Octavian_Morosan: and then reduce slowly
[3:26:46] Octavian_Morosan: 9g is a good price. 10 too high since 2 digits. and then u say "today best price 8,50" and then gradually go towards 8

[3:36:31] caveman_ju: 9g is too much, I would recommend 8 or even 7.99
[3:36:43] Octavian_Morosan: dude start with 9 and gradually decrease
[3:37:01] Octavian_Morosan: dont listen to caveman, he studied physics

[5:04:14] Kegen94: @lmgd1 every sport in the world is played by 0.001% the population. is sport not competetive?
[5:04:30] parla: but dota is a pvp game, being competitive is the only thing that game has
[5:04:37] skyzelol: but that doesnt mean its necessarily not competitive enough
[5:04:55] Kegen94: this guy must be baiting. this is the dumbest shit i have ever heard😂
[5:05:18] stankypanky22: so if you dont care about pvp whats the outrage over the boomkin stuff?

[5:09:32] Xerx31: just chat timeout
[5:09:33] skyzelol: so the 3 points are: 1. not enough people play 2. its not balanced 3. there is no prize/tournament
[5:09:50] throwmasterlol: do you want your chat to have that kind of stuff in it?
[5:10:03] Marnikx: cant offend you? you suck

[5:10:36] causemosmvp: here
[5:10:41] DrCokePhD: u seem very offended by him??
[5:10:50] coozy: Your numbers in point #1 is wrong, which completely invalidates point #2 and #3. Also I'm pretty sure you got carried to gladiator. I've watched you play for a while and I can tell you're not more than dualist max.
[5:11:14] stankypanky22: @coozy monkaS
[5:11:48] rullehjem: Arena KEKL
[5:11:52] easyafff: !guide
[5:11:52] StreamElements: RestedXP Hardcore Survival Guide is now officially released! https://www.restedxp.com/hardcore/?ref=lmgd
[5:11:55] NeoSpy: no one play arena
[5:12:02] rullehjem: Maybe arena just isn't fun?
[5:12:07] causemosmvp: Did someone tell lmgd he sucks at pvp and why he doesnt play arena?
[5:12:20] aabflug: what weapon are you using for this farm? skinning knife?
[5:12:20] stankypanky22: so if no one cares about or is interested in pvp balance, who cares if boomies are buffed or not? they can just get gnomer gear instead and do fine
[5:12:31] rullehjem: Battleground bis pvp
[5:12:35] DrCokePhD: but you are the one freaking out right now relax its just a game
[5:12:54] throwmasterlol: i mean it affects the open world so thats different yeah i agree.
[5:13:09] domehxy: i wanna have arena in sod, i would love it so much
[5:13:21] patriciobueno: low iq BibleThump BibleThump
[5:13:50] Zero_Kelvin: wait what was the initial question
[5:13:53] xlmgodx: brooooooo r u still ranting
[5:13:58] stankypanky22: didnt you need to pvp in tbc to get gear as well?
[5:14:22] Xerx31: u dont have to leave og in classic either - just buy summon and boost
[5:14:48] csd_up: 848
[5:14:52] Kegen94: @lmgd1 2. blizzard has set up arena as a endpoint to the whole pvp part of the game.. first you do BG to get better and better gear to play arena. so no, its not just a minigame. its a part of the whole pvp side of the game. 3. streamers that play arena have the most veiwers on wow on Twitch. so theres your insentive..
[5:15:10] RoryJumping: cause my party killls people not me
[5:15:39] skyzelol: so regarding 2 and 3, how is the balance different in pve? you still have OP classes in pve and non-viable classes you wouldnt bring to raid. You also dont really have competitive rewards for pve (RWF probably the closest thing and there is nothing blizz give)
[5:15:41] patriciobueno: why is the streamer dying all the time? Is he low iq?
[5:15:46] rullehjem: Who tf watches arena willingly? KEKL
[5:15:50] akulano: That is not true, or?!
[5:15:58] stankypanky22: @skyzelol same is true in dota/league - very unbalanced game
[5:16:00] akulano: who tf sets their Interest on PvE
[5:16:07] kulhansson: @Kegen94 my eyes thats a lot of bullshit, first off all the people with most viewers are people like gingi and joker.
[5:16:11] xlmgodx: idk 15 years ago much more ppl played arena pservers were popping off
[5:16:20] Aszkenasi: did reckful have that many viewers before he did irl streams and stuff?
[5:16:22] throwmasterlol: arena was a lot cooler before i think
[5:16:34] ControversyTV: arena is not for casual players and sod is targeted at casual players
[5:16:34] Xerx31: ppl are interested in watching competitive content - they watch arena, m+, rwf
[5:16:40] Zero_Kelvin: Doesn't the stat you're mentioning come from a 10+ year old post that meant the amount of people above 2k, not amount of pvpers?
[5:16:40] akulano: TBC and wrath were the peak for arena
[5:16:54] DinkDinkXD: what allows any class to farm this during the STV event?
[5:16:58] coozy: Hey
[5:17:03] xlmgodx: yea and u think 885 people of here would want to acctualy farm this stupid riddle papers?
[5:17:07] coozy: Your numbers in point #1 is wrong, which completely invalidates point #2 and #3. Also I'm pretty sure you got carried to gladiator. I've watched you play for a while and I can tell you're not more than dualist max.
[5:17:08] Marnikx: cant link the screenshot fyi with the 12 kills
[5:17:27] stankypanky22: solo shuffle is getting more people into arena
[5:17:41] xlmgodx: back in the day wotlk pvp was popping off
[5:17:47] Kegen94: everyone who plays wow knows playing top arena (not bg or open world bullshit) takes 5x the skill than playing pve
[5:18:04] xlmgodx: there were so many randoms at decent level to play with
[5:18:04] throwmasterlol: i legit queued solo shuffle as a first time healer 2 days ago and more then one person told me to ff irl
[5:18:06] stankypanky22: no one wants to play classic arena because its horribly balanced, check retail
[5:18:15] parla: u should remove ppl that play 10 games a week only
[5:18:19] parla: cus they dont pvp
[5:18:24] akulano: @coozy TBF I was better when I was younger, instead of now LUL
[5:18:32] akulano: just sayin
[5:18:43] causemosmvp: Pvp is just not popular anymore
[5:18:48] parla: @akulano or maybe everyone else was just worse
[5:18:50] causemosmvp: peaked in tbc wrath
[5:19:01] YoungPwN: people are also more likely to ALT PVE than ALT PVP for logs to inflate
[5:19:05] akulano: @parla You have a point! LUL
[5:19:21] Marnikx: tf u doing ingame btw?
[5:19:31] xlmgodx: BUT BACK IN THE DAY ACTUAL WOTLK PPL WERE ACCTUALY HUMANS PLAYING WOTLK ARENA NOT DOGS THERE WERE ACTTUALY MAGES TO PLAY WITH NOT JUST 3 THAT PLAY IT FOR 20 YEAR
[5:19:35] xlmgodx: SoBayed
[5:19:37] ControversyTV: what are you doing with collento's riddle it can be sold on ah ?
[5:19:37] kulhansson: its because they wont inflate the mmr in retail pvp wich makes it harder to climb in ladder and makes people less motivated to play
[5:19:38] StompingBox: POGGERS ARENA
[5:19:49] akulano: sadge
[5:19:59] Zero_Kelvin: Warmane andies keeping the ladder somewhat active
[5:20:00] ControversyTV: pog
[5:20:01] throwmasterlol: arena got inflated in tbc because of the weapons
[5:20:03] xlmgodx: yea and what tournaments are there for vanilla BGs?
[5:20:06] gdkpgold: GroupMeeting  Arena
[5:20:28] PeonYaMumma: yeah it only has a mmr rating tto show the skiill of the players pvp level, nothing aye. Private server mentality
[5:20:31] stankypanky22: otk duel tourny was huge
[5:20:34] Kegen94: @kulhansson as we speak, n1 streamer is playing arena. second is graycen, known for arena
