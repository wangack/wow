[4:40:50] Spirited__Away: There was an accusation made against soda for a serious crime. The accusation was made privately to Blizzard and the person possibly made a request not to be named publicly. Whether or not the accusation was true or not Blizzard believed it and quickly banned soda. The ban might have not been thought out and the people who made the decision didn't consult lawyers about it. Whatever the case pandora's box is now open and can't be closed.

[6:06:50] nomunt44: guys keep asking why he got banned it makes him feel good to talk about it. look at him, hear the positivity in his voice. its really a good Sunday. he even had to move back in his old guild to spread the fun and upgrade his game. we're having such a good time.

They used to make the spacing between the keys smaller on the ones without 10keys, but the one you/soda have looks like it is the same size as the k70 I have just without the 10 key so that would be easier to get used to for gaming at least.
