[4:32:49] justagamingfiend: does the engi belt still work to knock people off?
[4:33:00] farideo: if your maxed 80 on any covenant then you can swap to any covenant back and forth without doing the previous missions of loyalty.  There is an item you can buy that gets you instantly to 40 .  So if you do want to swap just make sure you have 80 renown on ur main covenant.
[4:33:50] farideo: I think its character based tho. Not sure.. Chat?
[4:34:02] kuponkikeke: Its account wide
[4:34:06] kuponkikeke: when you get the 80 renown achi
[4:34:26] kuponkikeke: No, you can buy a token that gives renown 40 insta
[4:34:34] Tenz0_: you can buy the 40 renown token
[4:34:36] Jordanlove4: yeah its account wide
[4:34:40] kuponkikeke: and if any of your characters has been renown 80 then you wont lose progression on any alts
[4:34:46] xxwheybolicxx92: yes if you hit 80 you can switch everything stays on that cov thats 80
[4:34:48] farideo: nono u never start at 0... its just loads of work to go back to the covenant you left and prove your "Loyalty or worth"
[4:34:52] justagamingfiend: you can also buy the 40 boost on everyone once 1 character has 80
[4:34:55] farideo: thats only if you dont have 80 max
[4:34:55] kuponkikeke: No it stays where you left it
[4:34:58] theragingcajun127: its character base. I tried with one of my toons and I had to start back at 0
[4:35:01] justagamingfiend: you lose nothing
[4:35:03] farideo: Never Start at Zero
[4:35:05] farideo: NEVER*
[4:35:12] ShaededOne: it doesn't reset when you change back
[4:35:16] justagamingfiend: @Swifty you lose nothing
[4:35:24] Onlyhuman1993: Geting caught up for new players is so bad
[4:35:32] ShaededOne: can buy the item to go to renown 40
[4:35:33] xxwheybolicxx92: not if you 80 with your main one
[4:35:41] ShaededOne: merchant by the flight guy in oribos
[4:35:59] ShaededOne: no you dont have to get 80 on alts
[4:36:00] Onlyhuman1993: you can send the item for 40 renown to alts
[4:36:05] FrostyCookie_: whatuppppp swifty
[4:36:06] kuponkikeke: No, if you have a character with 80 renown on your account its enoguh
[4:36:06] Onlyhuman1993: its account bound item from vender
[4:36:07] ShaededOne: i am an altoholic lol
[4:36:11] justagamingfiend: no
[4:36:17] Cybernytez: xD this chat
[4:36:23] Animalfitz: what vendor
[4:36:23] Tenz0_: when you change covenent where you havnt done any progress at all, you will start at 0 but then you can buy the 40 token and then you can just do torghast or zer'mortis to get renown
[4:36:34] TweakT: fight for the right to party
[4:36:37] theragingcajun127: i have an 80 renown and my other toon was in the 50s......and I switched covenants and it brought me back to 0
[4:36:40] Cybernytez: its so easy swifty just get 80 renown on venthyr and then you can always change

[4:37:18] Geartrix: you will be 80 again
[4:37:21] grandpagolden: I still remember when legion had first come out, blood dks in bgs were super op and needed to be nerfed.
[4:37:23] Onlyhuman1993: nope you would be 73 still
[4:37:24] unablekinkajoo: No, you stay at 73
[4:37:25] Geartrix: 73
[4:37:26] toudi933: u keep it
[4:37:26] kuponkikeke: ^
[4:37:26] tankatrono_o: next to the flight master in oribos, you can buy a renown boost for 500g to get your current covenant to 40, and yes, i think you have to get to 80 per char once to be sble to switch freely.
[4:37:27] Jordanlove4: it will be the same where you left off at 73
[4:37:29] homewrecker101: no ull be at 73
[4:37:31] loukatmie: it stays at the same
[4:37:34] justagamingfiend: @Swifty you would not lose anything
[4:37:34] hyperdrivexx: 73 still
[4:37:36] ShaededOne: no you don't have to
[4:37:38] kuponkikeke: No

[4:37:43] Jordanlove4: nope its account wide
[4:37:48] iTzNiightyNiite: each one keeps it's renown
[4:37:50] farideo: as long as a char on the account has 80 renown
[4:37:52] Ezcotli: nice
[4:37:56] Malfuseen: what does renown even give at this point?
[4:37:57] iTzNiightyNiite: so go would be to get them all to 80
[4:38:00] Tenz0_: That i dont know, i havnt tried to change on my alts at all after i hit 80 on my main, can be the case that you need to hit 80 on every character to have it instant or vice versa
[4:38:01] atoker: you don't start over
[4:38:02] iTzNiightyNiite: so goal**
[4:38:06] homewrecker101: no only reason u need to be 80 is to start at 40 on another
[4:38:07] farideo: You can try it right now :D
[4:38:16] justagamingfiend: as long as you have 1 character with 80 on the account nothing changes
[4:38:22] farideo: If you have another char with 80 renown you can do it right now.
[4:38:28] iTzNiightyNiite: the new storyline gives renown every single quest
[4:38:35] iTzNiightyNiite: good for alts
