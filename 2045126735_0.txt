[2:38:04] Molvonos: @PsychoRaptor That's not what's causing it, I can guarentee it.
[2:38:16] Molvonos: Coincidence, perhaps, but not the cause.
[2:39:06] TheeCableguy: I havent touched it yet all I know is that it is communist pokemon

[2:47:13] jason_shade: so
[2:47:25] Sheridan_cas: Palworld is just like Archeage
[2:47:33] TheeCableguy: my favorite pokemon mod is the original game but it replaces all the pokemon with DBZ characters
[2:47:34] teggylyn: easily gets nominated
[2:47:34] Sheridan_cas: it's gonna fizzle
[2:47:41] Galadeon: 100% on the indie game.

[2:51:21] YoHizen: 875,343 @Towelliee
[2:51:31] TheeCableguy: BG3 sold 27.07 million copies.

[2:52:12] YoHizen: @Sheridan_cas this is a dumb take lol
[2:52:14] Stoffy1: @roguebear some already do. think starfield came with model of a credit from in the game with the code on it which was a cool way to do it
[2:52:22] PsychoRaptor: @YoHizen i was closish, didnt even look it up just happen to remember the hype lol
[2:52:56] TakeThatBack: does sod have the increased lvl gain yet?

[2:53:31] RogueBear: @Stoffy1 i actually really like that idea
[2:53:37] TheeCableguy: they said there will be an XP buff to 25 similar to winds
[2:54:01] VarlBGem: I'd need to make gaming my fulltime job in order to find the time to play all those games.
[2:54:11] TakeThatBack: It would make sense for them to toss that xp buff like a week or two before level cap increase i would imagine
[2:54:13] Stoffy1: they are also putting up those numbers while also on game pass
