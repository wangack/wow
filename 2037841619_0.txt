[0:01:30] americanmoses18: saw my first one in a raid drop doe to a ret
[0:01:51] mrxilio: man these class changes for tuesday are interesting
[0:03:11] MaybeRespect: I swear every season becomes caster heaven by middle/end
[0:03:19] GamerKrown: Felt like they only needed to tweak things from some classes to have some of the best balance the game has seen. Now I'm seeing these nerfs/buffs and seems like they're just gonna fk it all up
[0:04:52] mrxilio: yeah we will see... not sure how big of buffs/nerfs they really are
[0:05:01] anmusallam: its blizz thats just how it goes :(
[0:07:18] kirtach: yoo
[0:07:20] MaybeRespect: DK biggest loser per usual
[0:07:37] sunileif: rogue nerf isnt enough
[0:08:22] anmusallam: i hear its a demolock meta this reset
[0:08:28] GamerKrown: How dh dodged nerfs is nuts to me lol
[0:08:45] MaybeRespect: @anmusallam Any caster really.
[0:09:48] anmusallam: i dont want to play against demo and mage every game :\
[0:10:04] Fueldx: How do you know theres alot of changes coming tuesday?
[0:10:30] Devcomz: yeah these changes want me not want to do 3s entirely unless I have a lock on my team
[0:10:46] wEiRdO_dUdE: No changes for DH seems a little crazy to me
[0:10:59] notmes: https://www.bluetracker.gg/wow/topic/us-en/1770076-class-tuning-incoming-january-23/
[0:10:59] sunileif: shit changes
[0:11:00] Mortifiedwow: @Fueldx uhhh blue post?
[0:11:10] thepartyzone: rip dk
[0:11:13] MaybeRespect: I'm probably done for the season after these DK changes tbh
[0:11:19] c0jaK: wow spoilers
[0:11:37] al_capow: woah woah woah
[0:11:39] al_capow: early bird
[0:11:57] nikthevoker: sup
[0:12:05] anmusallam: how are u mesman
[0:12:08] jasuvex: not touching restod and barely looking at rog...seems like blizzard
[0:12:18] petkicklol: ret patch 2.0
[0:12:27] avenueone: mini go every 30 seconds
[0:12:30] pathowatch: Oh notes good to see
[0:12:39] anmusallam: @petkicklol are we screwed
[0:12:56] MaybeRespect: @petkicklol bro....gutted again
[0:13:34] nikthevoker: the stam is a lazy change
[0:13:35] buffevoker: Mes they need to buff evokers
[0:13:45] nikthevoker: ^
[0:13:49] mrxilio: @notmes eh the set has something wrong with it.. usually the larger the regular verdict the smaller the secondary set bonus verdict i believe.. dont think that the set bonus will matter much
[0:13:56] mrxilio: but the buffs seem huge on wake
[0:13:59] dankNstein_: what are the thoughts on warlocks getting way more tanky
[0:14:10] artsskeit: lazy blizzard devs?  never seen that before
[0:14:36] WagwanBombaClatBomba: Im so tired and bored of blizzard
[0:14:53] WagwanBombaClatBomba: Dk viable max 2month and dogshit for 12
[0:14:58] WagwanBombaClatBomba: i dont get it
[0:15:00] dankNstein_: warlocks 30% more armor and 10% more stam seems ridiculous to me
[0:15:08] wEiRdO_dUdE: Demo might be beefcake again, yeah
[0:15:13] avenueone: @dankNstein_ truth
[0:15:14] sunileif: nerf arms
[0:15:23] artsskeit: all in all, time to play pokemon with guns
[0:15:28] MaybeRespect: @dankNstein_ and lock armor is already +100% in pvp and demon armor.
[0:16:14] sunileif: so mm is low key being nerfed
[0:16:23] SoraSkyforge: already unsubbed @notmes
[0:16:30] SoraSkyforge: completely destroyed us
[0:16:31] b_lappy: resto shammy getting an armor nerf seems strange since they can get trained by melee cleaves
[0:16:38] SoraSkyforge: it makes absolutely no sense to destroy a class like that
[0:16:40] sunileif: Saususge
[0:16:55] zachgamegodx: wait catharsis is health based?
[0:17:15] sunileif: 350 armor
[0:17:18] zachgamegodx: it’s minor, lock has 18# % in PvP
[0:17:18] kirtach: is huge @notmes on lock
[0:17:23] zachgamegodx: 18*1.35
[0:17:33] kirtach: warrior, ww, hunter?
[0:17:38] thepartyzone: -4k armor for plate
[0:17:40] avenueone: oh ww too
[0:17:42] sunileif: at 484 my mage has 2600 armor
[0:17:44] SoraSkyforge: Festering wounds nerf, DC nerf, Necro wounds 33.3 % nerf (I KNOW THEY DID THIS CUZ THEY INCREASED HEALTH POOLS BUT STILL) combined with 35% armor decrease, dk will be completely playable
[0:17:44] kreyzy8: feral
[0:17:45] jasuvex: feral but those dont exist
[0:17:48] Devcomz: I dont think it nerfs assa tbh their damage isnt really negated by armor imo
[0:17:49] syraxsis: enh windfury build
[0:17:51] anmusallam: cant wait to see what you think about the cc change
[0:17:54] dankNstein_: 10% stam helps loc kout a lot doesnt it
[0:17:57] SoraSkyforge: and we will die to hunter, ww and warriors in a global
[0:18:00] zachgamegodx: their gaining roughly 8% reduction
[0:18:20] sunileif: so maybe 3500 armor after changes?
[0:18:27] thepartyzone: is it because mainly magic damage @notmes
[0:18:31] dankNstein_: the 10% stam is bigger than the armor for locks i think
[0:18:48] zachgamegodx: i think locks have 18% armor in PvP
[0:18:49] nikthevoker: feral
[0:18:57] nikthevoker: how can you forget your main
[0:18:59] zachgamegodx: 35% inc is 24% I guess 6%
[0:19:09] c0jaK: feral is a sick joke
[0:19:12] jasuvex: its unreal they are making a shit spec even worse by buffing armor
[0:19:16] jasuvex: get me out of this game alrready :D
[0:19:17] sunileif: its cause with my 489 gear my hunter crits clothies for 300k
[0:19:23] thepartyzone: lock armor change is +6.79% physical damage mitigation
[0:19:33] anmusallam: did soul leech get indirectly buffed?
[0:19:36] mrxilio: that fear change... oh lord
[0:19:39] SoraSkyforge: Festering wounds nerf, DC nerf, Necro wounds 33.3 % nerf (I KNOW THEY DID THIS CUZ THEY INCREASED HEALTH POOLS BUT STILL) combined with 35% armor decrease, dk will be completely playable and will die to physical dmg like paper, the usual stuff, class unplayable for 6 months until buffs @notmes
[0:19:39] eMBeaR64oz: doomsday
[0:19:59] healmeshammy: yep 0 sense
[0:20:11] MaybeRespect: DK already gets rekt by phys damage. So the armor change is rough
[0:20:15] Abruty: at this point, just remove class armor, everybody wears the same
[0:20:19] Firepumav2: will frost dk's be good?
[0:20:29] Covlol: I think mage/lock have far too much in their kit to warrant passive tankyness but we will have to see.
[0:20:36] honsou2: imagine not playing rogue or DH next reset LUL
[0:20:37] anmusallam: i mean tbh i think the necro wound nerf is uncalled for
[0:20:38] thepartyzone: dh dk still top tier
[0:20:55] panjack13: anyone got a link for this?
[0:21:00] SoraSkyforge: ok i guess
[0:21:01] mrxilio: can you death fears anymore with that?
[0:21:07] SoraSkyforge: good luck fighting a bm hunter after nerfs
[0:21:09] SoraSkyforge: xD
[0:21:38] anmusallam: its a 7.7% nerf
[0:21:43] anmusallam: when i calculated
[0:21:43] Moobot: Join my Discord community! https://discord.gg/mes
[0:22:02] c0jaK: mesMath
[0:23:17] MaybeRespect: Well it falls off if you don't DS every other global tbh. Or stunned
[0:23:24] nikthevoker: mesMath FACtS
[0:23:33] DigitalBodyBuilder: @notmes so ret pallies are BACK?
[0:23:36] petkicklol: 10% hp gonna make death strike do work
[0:23:43] wEiRdO_dUdE: That health buff is big, for sure
[0:23:44] artsskeit: gladiator chat
[0:23:59] pharmztko: teehee
[0:24:06] anmusallam: wait so death strike is getting buff indirectly? @petkicklol
[0:24:22] petkicklol: correct
[0:24:24] petkicklol: same with ams and amz
[0:24:26] wokesmeedg: !wa
[0:24:26] StreamElements: Dragonflight: https://wago.io/pjH2s0KV3
[0:24:42] b_lappy: same with death pact for locks
[0:24:45] MaybeRespect: How exactly does AMS scale w/ HP. I don't even know this
[0:24:55] wokesmeedg: hey mes which nameplates ares up to date on wagio
[0:25:11] thepartyzone: I think ret demo comes back tbh
[0:25:28] SoraSkyforge: i still believe the 35% armor is way too harsh
[0:25:32] SoraSkyforge: on us especially
[0:25:51] luriosbael: i just won the leggo :D
[0:25:59] MaybeRespect: So AMS is 600k atm. So it will be 660k?
[0:26:06] MaybeRespect: Before damp
[0:26:36] anmusallam: but will doomburst still be a viable option
[0:26:55] petkicklol: unholy thrives in a manabar type meta
[0:27:02] petkicklol: that alone will make unholy good
[0:27:11] SoraSkyforge: so u think the 33,3% nerf on necrotic wounds its fine
[0:27:47] healmeshammy: dont thin game will slow down though
[0:27:49] petkicklol: necro wounds counts as dam with scoreboard
[0:27:49] healmeshammy: think
[0:28:16] eMBeaR64oz: they pre nerfed the warlock fear dam taken and Druid root dam taken talents for the global increase but. or to priests fear, psychic scream gonna tank quite a bit now
[0:28:19] WagwanBombaClatBomba: necro wounds also passively heal us
[0:28:40] wEiRdO_dUdE: DH dodged it, yep
[0:29:25] WagwanBombaClatBomba: i love that we are positive here, but on wed. we gonna get destroyed by melees
[0:29:27] wEiRdO_dUdE: Ferals could still be forced to try to cyclone a ton
[0:29:58] Covlol: trap already feels useless :(
[0:30:01] BuCh3RCSGO: HOW IS RDROOD NERF NOT MORE?
[0:30:03] ionlyplaymetas: the cloth buff is going to make warlocks and mages feel absolutely unkillable
[0:30:16] healmeshammy: nah
[0:30:24] dubbfiend: is warrior gonna become garbo now?
[0:30:51] Firepumav2: how is frost dk
[0:30:52] eMBeaR64oz: most your mana spent on rejuvenate and life bloom
[0:30:55] mrxilio: Rdruid kit this season is pretty strong... think they will still be good
[0:31:01] Firepumav2: rip
[0:31:07] thepartyzone: I think Stam makes ret war even better
[0:31:26] healmeshammy: ret/war gona rise up
[0:31:52] healmeshammy: they will nerf ret the same week
[0:31:55] SoraSkyforge: i agree nerf DS again
[0:31:58] mrxilio: warrior will do less dmg though right? since armor matters for for them
[0:31:58] SoraSkyforge: also nerf ams
[0:31:59] MaybeRespect: @ionlyplaymetas Arcane mage into melee cleaves Kappa
[0:31:59] petkicklol: 500k death strikes inc
[0:32:00] honsou2: they buffed the mana regen on individual resto druid abilities
[0:32:09] WagwanBombaClatBomba: and when we face melee cleaves we just perma run Kappa
[0:32:11] wEiRdO_dUdE: 10% more death strike sounds good to me
[0:32:35] Dragoresh: gonna play a little bit of ret mes?
[0:32:37] MaybeRespect: @petkicklol 500k really? My avg. in arena is like 150-200k
[0:32:41] djrainxx: Mes your opinion best caster rn?
[0:32:58] petkicklol: ive seen some massive ones
[0:33:05] anmusallam: i mean death strike rn does nothing most of the time
[0:33:09] petkicklol: 380k+ as of rn but thats all time high
[0:33:11] anmusallam: so thats a good change
[0:33:33] SoraSkyforge: ds feels weak as fuck right now
[0:33:35] MaybeRespect: DS is unreliable though. Disarm,range,fof,evasion,blur,bop,bub. I hate relying on it
[0:33:39] mrxilio: think FMage 4set is a brainfreeze proc right?
[0:34:07] pharmztko: glacial spike procs a flurry or something
[0:34:29] anmusallam: and the ams absorb also increases death strike heal correct?
[0:34:38] WagwanBombaClatBomba: time to gem stam gems Kappa
[0:34:43] Devcomz: Crimson Vial is based of health
[0:35:01] thepartyzone: ret war guna go crazy
[0:35:28] nikthevoker: devoker not gonna use tier again
[0:35:32] nikthevoker: 0 tier LUL
[0:35:33] mrxilio: ret/dh looks good but armor buff will effect warriors i believe
[0:35:43] reklebin: good evening
[0:36:12] esqueuetv: cloth armor buff is only a 4% global reduction in damage from physical
[0:36:17] MaybeRespect: IG i'm just worried about 2xcaster dampener meta again.
[0:36:27] thepartyzone: 6% damage mit into warriors doesn’t matter because they are there for MS
[0:36:29] onedayoumay985: goodnight Dk and war ?
[0:36:39] anmusallam: so rip claw death coil
[0:36:42] thepartyzone: also Stam for war nice and also the ret buffs are huge
[0:36:43] Cammyz: Did the wizards need this
[0:36:49] petkicklol: may have to be sores into some rdruid stuff just to be able to stop drinks
[0:37:02] eMBeaR64oz: hopefully the cloth armor buff is base armor, or else with demon skin they’ll have only 1k less than a war
[0:37:18] eMBeaR64oz: warlocks *
[0:37:23] SoraSkyforge: Bloodforge saving us from monk's dmg POGCHAMP
[0:37:39] honsou2: all comps will be dh comps if no one can die and if people still die its a rogue meta
[0:37:48] anmusallam: pikaboo says it might be an outlaw meta
[0:37:59] anmusallam: like for rogues
[0:38:00] Payo: 1727 raiders from Payo have joined! 
[0:38:00] StreamElements: Payo just raided the channel with 1727 viewers PogChamp

[0:38:35] MaybeRespect: @petkicklol How do you deal with Splay/lock mage etc. Feels impossible already now even harder
[0:38:36] sistahfistah1: huge host gz POGGERWOBBLE
[0:38:39] nivoxt: @notmes why you host payo and leave the stream insta? payo wants to talk to you..
[0:38:50] yGiando: @nivoxt kekl
[0:38:54] petkicklol: @MaybeRespect ur gonna be passively tankier
[0:38:59] jasuvex: sub is dead KEKW heard that one before
[0:39:13] Gigii2: why do you say SoD is dead ?
[0:39:23] stockbridge10: always heard that
[0:39:26] wEiRdO_dUdE: Evisc is part of their big spike, right?
[0:39:28] Devcomz: Going to go from Sub to outlaw maybe even more assa as well
[0:39:30] thepartyzone: I think assas afflic will be better than outlaw
[0:39:33] Gigii2: we dont see cause of your image
[0:39:38] mayfire15: ret tho?!
[0:39:46] thepartyzone: assas afflic is big in eu
[0:39:54] MaybeRespect: @petkicklol Meant strat wise. Seems hard even now to land kill
[0:40:05] JD_Yadig: sub will not be dead they still have way too much cc
[0:40:10] petkicklol: idk what ur playing
[0:40:16] onedayoumay985: Warrior is bad too right after changes ??
[0:40:16] petkicklol: most dk comps do well into that stuff tho
[0:40:21] MaybeRespect: @petkicklol Impish cracked
[0:40:52] WagwanBombaClatBomba: i agree with sam
[0:40:54] sistahfistah1: its gonna wizard + dh / ww for sure no?
[0:40:56] cbzx: warlocks are gonna be insane
[0:40:57] Devcomz: I think its more of a lock meta more than a wizard meta but I could be wrong
[0:41:02] classic_ash: are DKs dead? were already squishier after against melee
[0:41:16] cbzx: demo/ret/rsham
[0:41:17] anmusallam: i mean warlock is gonna be the caster class meta
[0:41:18] mayfire15: probably still be melee caster
[0:41:20] IamWalnuts: i could see demo / frost taking over with the hp and armor buffs
[0:41:24] WagwanBombaClatBomba: casters gets more hp and armor
[0:41:26] WagwanBombaClatBomba: its gg no rere
[0:41:33] mayfire15: dh ww and outlaw and ret maybe
[0:41:35] zachgamegodx: the roots break threshold change really scares me. frost mages could be dominant with the increased ability to shatter and lock down clusters of targets
[0:41:43] honsou2: lock mage / lock dh / mage dh / dh ele / ret dh / dh dk
[0:41:44] Moobot: Tshirts, hoodies, and mugs available now! https://merch.streamelements.com/notmes
[0:41:57] SoraSkyforge: mes flaming me for my rating poggers
[0:41:58] SoraSkyforge: thats a new
[0:42:07] onedayoumay985: casters are worse at the beginning of an expansion because of low health or did I miss something
[0:42:11] MaybeRespect: I feel that now. I find myself not wanting to go LOS w/ ams down
[0:42:28] Gideon2826: DK nerfs QQ
[0:42:34] americanmoses18: dk nerf man so lame
[0:42:47] anmusallam: because strang just is too good
[0:42:58] healmeshammy: ok overall stake on comps changes?
[0:43:03] anmusallam: i think thats why
[0:43:10] seraph_wow: no dew today?
[0:43:11] SweRobb: Mes , dk are done this expansion
[0:43:13] MaybeRespect: Feels awkward to play bloodforged into cast/melee/x
[0:43:21] anmusallam: no one wants to drop the utility
[0:43:43] Mortifiedwow: tbh... we should just flame mes for his rating.
[0:43:47] SoraSkyforge: im 2.4 cr in 3s if u were wondering
[0:43:51] Mortifiedwow: won awc hah get a life nerd Kappa
[0:43:53] SweRobb: but Mes comon 30% armor nerf
[0:44:02] anmusallam: can we use valkyr
[0:44:02] SoraSkyforge: which is shit
[0:44:04] SoraSkyforge: but idc
[0:44:06] anmusallam: as a replacement
[0:44:11] sistahfistah1: 30% armor is 5% physical dmg reduction fyi its not that much
[0:44:24] Gideon2826: Hey mes..can you remove your weapon and help me understand how you would gear once you get leggo...because my verse is really low
[0:44:26] MaybeRespect: Sudden doom fools nice even without doomburst no?
[0:44:29] MaybeRespect: Feels*
[0:44:32] supatease: mes
[0:44:32] WagwanBombaClatBomba: like imagine u face a mage and a ww, now u have to go mage. and ww sitting ur ass whole game. aint no bloodforge gonna save us
[0:44:36] railander: what u think of the global stam buff?
[0:44:47] JD_Yadig: dev dodged nerfs bless jdyadiBeam
[0:44:50] seraph_wow: SUPAAH HOT FIA
[0:44:52] wEiRdO_dUdE: 10% health does help to become tankier
[0:44:54] supatease: whose ready to see how long a tournament match can last
[0:45:00] americanmoses18: fuck dragons fr fr
[0:45:06] JD_Yadig: indirectly yeah lol
[0:45:09] SweRobb: @sistahfistah1 hmm ok 5% maby i change my mind then
[0:45:12] reklebin: need a body for sod raid in hour?
[0:45:20] ionlyplaymetas: so wait do you think those ret buffs are real? i thought they just forgot to put "does not apply to pvp" lmao
[0:45:25] classic_ash: so Mes, do you think Bloodforged will be mandatory against double melee cleave?
[0:45:26] anmusallam: is gargoyle a good choice @notmes
[0:45:29] ionlyplaymetas: i thought for sure i was getting trolled
[0:45:39] supatease: big increase of play is juicing mmr
[0:45:39] serratedlove: demo ret meta inc
[0:45:47] supatease: and putting a bis pve item in
[0:45:50] Mortifiedwow: @supatease getting the boys some arena viagra ... if the match lasts more than 4 hrs we're gonna need some doctors
[0:45:50] americanmoses18: demo ret lol RETS FINE
[0:46:02] railander: @sistahfistah1 has anyone checked how much change will be for plate?
[0:46:23] americanmoses18: gimme cr from the 2800 andues
[0:46:26] americanmoses18: andys*
[0:46:27] Old_Tomatoes: Rating decay?
[0:46:28] Applezbtw: They are only boosting the mmr of the 10 people left playing LUL
[0:46:29] MaybeRespect: I see alot of my friends quitting because of how fast game is in conjunction to CC bloat.
[0:46:47] jasuvex: there is nothing wrong with mmr anymore ppl just wanna get insta free rating...problem is that ppl just dont wanna play
[0:46:54] sistahfistah1: you can check it urself if you take ur gear off till u lose 30% armor which is 5% physical dmg reduction @railander
[0:47:08] dubbfiend: how much longer do you think we have this season?
[0:47:08] railander: @sistahfistah1 i dont have a platie
[0:47:19] seraph_wow: got my 2.1 today in 2s p.s ggs the games yesterday mes
[0:47:20] SweRobb: @sistahfistah1 are you really sure 30% armor nerf is 5% damage taken ???
[0:47:32] thepartyzone: I still argue for account wide mmr / rating
[0:47:34] sistahfistah1: yes im sure
[0:47:44] healmeshammy: ok what comps you think we may see more?
[0:47:51] railander: the survival is global though so cant really count on it
[0:47:59] supatease: the armor changes just make the descripency of advantage and disadvantage a pure physical class experiences
[0:48:03] supatease: game is slower overall
[0:48:06] wEiRdO_dUdE: I was wondering exactly how much damage loss that is
[0:48:07] thepartyzone: assas afflic @healmeshammy ret war
[0:48:15] thepartyzone: mld
[0:48:37] thepartyzone: assas was the squishier spec now gets 10% more hp
[0:48:48] MaybeRespect: @supatease Don't think it's odd how tanky lock is gonna be?
[0:49:00] thepartyzone: is ignore pain health based?
[0:49:06] avenueone: ret shield of veangeance getting better too
[0:49:09] WagwanBombaClatBomba: is gonna be a demo meta
[0:49:13] WagwanBombaClatBomba: and nobody likes a demo meta
[0:49:17] WagwanBombaClatBomba: LUL
[0:49:17] railander: @supatease armor is def the right way to tune things IMO, for example warlock is way too tanky against casters but gets ran over by melee.
[0:49:18] serratedlove: does the +10% stam stack with the extra stam outlaw gets from that one talent?
[0:49:27] Mortifiedwow: they should just remove armor
[0:49:28] Mortifiedwow: lel
[0:49:28] Diviniumz: we've come full circle back to ret demo rsham
[0:49:32] healmeshammy: its not gona be demo meta at all
[0:49:34] Old_Tomatoes: Destros mad about losing thier tier set
[0:49:37] supatease: armor changes just tunes armor to everyone is mail armor type
[0:49:46] MaybeRespect: @railander Warlocks w/ Impish Instincts don't get ran over by melee anymore.
[0:49:59] Drathimos: warlocks def need a compensation nerf for all these new changes. they scale too well with them
[0:50:08] healmeshammy: gona get run over rets burst
[0:50:15] railander: @MaybeRespect depends on melee and on map
[0:50:18] dipset89: do you think dk nerf is fine?
[0:50:26] supatease: i feel like most of their pacing decisions stem from solo shuffle
[0:50:33] supatease: so they should just put solo shuffle dampening in 3v3
[0:50:36] thepartyzone: dk dh still s tier
[0:50:44] MaybeRespect: Has DK ever won a tournament @notmes ?
[0:50:52] dipset89: the ms nerf? i mean 3% i mean 4% was low but now 3% why
[0:50:58] anmusallam: @notmes will a commander be more viable with the wound nerf?
[0:51:06] anmusallam: commander build\
[0:51:10] healmeshammy: could see ret/dk
[0:51:28] honsou2: @healmeshammy not when dh is better than both of them by miles
[0:51:30] MaybeRespect: @healmeshammy MS though
[0:51:32] enviscerate: @MaybeRespect phdk won blizzcon like 12 years ago :^)
[0:51:36] Gideon2826: Hey mes..can you remove your weapon and help me understand how you would gear once you get leggo...because my verse is really low
[0:51:37] kirtach: Imagine play dk/dh or tsg and face ret/warr or ret/dh, no way u sin that melee mirrors as dk imo
[0:51:38] wokesmeedg: @notmes  where cdewx at :$
[0:51:44] railander: healing is def going to be way too strong now, starting at 10% already feels slow paced.
[0:51:45] healmeshammy: i said could
[0:51:47] honsou2: they can still do a DH nerf on patch day, hopefully
[0:52:02] WagwanBombaClatBomba: blizzard hates dks
[0:52:05] WagwanBombaClatBomba: it is what it is
[0:52:17] MaybeRespect: Just curious. Dk just seems like bastard
[0:52:35] honsou2: Why does it matter if they buff the ret burst if you say stamina changes make no one die?
[0:52:41] wEiRdO_dUdE: Yeah final verdict could be wicked
[0:52:54] Applezbtw: wel its good ret isnt a 20 yard caster .... wait... Kappa
[0:52:56] wyldeshock: Mes, if Blizzard is swallowed by a sinkhole and gone forever, what game you playin?
[0:52:58] Mortifiedwow: @honsou2 ret makes the healer oom faster
[0:53:15] Judgejudyx: i just got leggo
[0:53:22] kirtach: Imagine play dk/dh or tsg and face ret/warr or ret/dh, no way u win that melee mirrors as dk imo
[0:53:26] backhairisbeautiful: rets already do insane damage, these buffs were too much
[0:53:28] thepartyzone: @notmes ret gains a lot from lego because talents buff it
[0:53:35] supatease: there choice on which pve changes went through felt random
[0:53:39] Mortifiedwow: @notmes You don't think rets will make the enemy healer oom faster?
[0:53:39] supatease: like feral no buffs
[0:53:41] supatease: ret all buffs
[0:53:45] Judgejudyx: the ablitys trash but the 10ilevels and minor is like 2% dmg roughly
[0:53:46] zachgamegodx: the crusading strikes?
[0:53:48] dipset89: but it was 30%, than 24% now 18% what next 12%? every dps has way more what has "ms" and we have to stack it up not like other classes and 15sec. is like nothing you need like 3-4 sek. to get the max stacks so you have 11-12sec. the debuff on the target
[0:53:52] healmeshammy: like no mw buffs
[0:53:58] sistahfistah1: feral doesnt need damage with their disgusting clone gameplay
[0:54:07] honsou2: will the legendary ever be a 100% drop
[0:54:07] sistahfistah1: they do so much damage if they get clones off
[0:54:08] healmeshammy: ^
[0:54:11] WagwanBombaClatBomba: are we not gonna talk about DH
[0:54:13] c0jaK: "curious about"
[0:54:15] thepartyzone: bann boomkins from arena
[0:54:18] sunileif: maybe this will lead to mm pve buffs ?
[0:54:19] MaybeRespect: @dipset89 Seems outdated for sure. But stacks at least?
[0:54:22] Klonkish: payoS
[0:54:28] afriKENx: warlocks finally will be tanky Kappa
[0:54:31] SweRobb: @honsou2 dont think so
[0:54:41] WagwanBombaClatBomba: i really tought DH would get a nerf
[0:54:47] WagwanBombaClatBomba: Cause they are an insane class
[0:54:49] dubbfiend: does DH do any phys dmg or is it all magic?
[0:54:54] sistahfistah1: dhs are insane atm yea ngl
[0:55:01] MaybeRespect: But Dk needed nerfs?
[0:55:10] Mortifiedwow: @notmes how do melee deal with arc mage/ 15 sec port lock?
[0:55:12] healmeshammy: dh is kinda busted
[0:55:20] mrxilio: DH kit/mobility seems more impactful
[0:55:20] Suilenx: !nameplates

[0:55:22] Firepumav2: did DH get hit with anything
[0:55:22] healmeshammy: when they can death sweep for 300k
[0:55:25] railander: dk currently is way too tanky while doing crazy dmg
[0:55:35] SweRobb: @honsou2 will only be 100% if you listen to arabic music in Sweden :D
[0:55:41] MaybeRespect: that's fine. Just wanted some defensive buffs (ik we got stam but still)
[0:55:46] afriKENx: dk isnt gonna be tanky at all after the armor nerf
[0:55:55] WagwanBombaClatBomba: DH is number 1 on both regions in shuffle
[0:55:59] supatease: the immo aura still not nerfed
[0:56:00] Klonkish: payoS
[0:56:07] al_capow: rp wise that makes sense to me :D
[0:56:09] dipset89: @MaybeRespect it stack for every wound you proc +1 max is 6. @ the time you get the first stack the timer runs down from 15sec.
[0:56:19] crosstip: @notmes not gonna be able to make it tonight i got called into work
[0:56:24] SoraSkyforge: i think they cater to 1500 players and classes like warlock and casters in general perform worse than easy to play classes like DK, so blizzard acts accordingly
[0:56:25] thepartyzone: remember when ret aoe dispellec the team
[0:56:43] SoraSkyforge: perform worse in low mmr matches
[0:56:47] WagwanBombaClatBomba: tru atually
[0:56:49] MaybeRespect: @SoraSkyforge Easy entry* classes
[0:56:49] SoraSkyforge: cuz they are harder to play
[0:56:50] SoraSkyforge: i meant
[0:57:00] SoraSkyforge: ye @MaybeRespect
[0:57:07] Applezbtw: cdew said it best dhs' are king of the noobs LUL
[0:57:13] ionlyplaymetas: lol destro and demo "hard to play" kekw
[0:57:13] railander: @SoraSkyforge i actually just checked ladder and melee is even more overrepresented in top 100 than overall.
[0:57:15] MaybeRespect: I can see it 100% being warlock meta.
[0:57:22] IamWalnuts: we all know the sv and hpriest buffs means Zen / Bic / Rat are taking EU Kappa
[0:57:24] thepartyzone: I think splay is back
[0:57:26] sistahfistah1: demo + frost mage going stonks rising
[0:57:35] Swertson: spriest/ele
[0:57:47] WagwanBombaClatBomba: i can see sp affli
[0:57:48] WagwanBombaClatBomba: do good
[0:57:56] thepartyzone: ret dh
[0:57:56] MaybeRespect: SPlay felt insane already. Watching you guys vs shards team felt horrible
[0:58:01] railander: @WagwanBombaClatBomba aff sucks
[0:58:06] MaybeRespect: Last night
[0:58:08] Applezbtw: if ret uses his dispel and dh uses immo aura dispel can just do whatever they wayt
[0:58:13] Applezbtw: want*
[0:58:26] WagwanBombaClatBomba: mes atually making me happy
[0:58:32] WagwanBombaClatBomba: LUL
[0:58:45] MaybeRespect: Think PHDK Still good? No hunter changes
[0:58:52] sistahfistah1: is it time to play tigerseye brew into warlocks as ww now Pog
[0:58:56] honsou2: @WagwanBombaClatBomba damp meta making you happy? not having any damage outside of diseases and waiting 20 min to win Kreygasm
[0:59:03] alex6812: Won't it just be more damp
[0:59:04] Dristereau: The timing kinda sucks the weeks before the Tourney
[0:59:29] buffnac: why you say hunters nerfed bad?
[0:59:32] WagwanBombaClatBomba: @honsou2 i mean more like, that dk isnt rly destroyed
[0:59:40] Shway1013: def sounds like they are letting wizards breath
[0:59:41] MaybeRespect: Wait how did hunter get nerfed. :o
[0:59:48] SoraSkyforge: so u think dks will effectively be better next week? im not attacking you, literally just asking @notmes
[0:59:49] sistahfistah1: i think caster players disagree xD
[0:59:53] railander: melee clearly overrepresented.
[0:59:54] thepartyzone: if we hit caster meta I think afflic or demo becomes best
[0:59:54] Covlol: I absolutely hated the state of the game, as a surv player.
[0:59:56] wEiRdO_dUdE: This is a bigger change than usual, for sure
[1:00:08] MaybeRespect: Ahh true. But survival is magical and 5% buff atleast?
[1:00:18] dubbfiend: is warrior ded
[1:00:23] MaybeRespect: Surv felt fine into casters. Played it to 2.5
[1:00:28] thepartyzone: no
[1:00:39] MaybeRespect: With it*
[1:00:44] kirtach: So w are going to play dh/dk or dk/warr and face other melee cleaves like ret/war or dh/ret or war/dh and they Will Smash us imo
[1:00:57] syraxsis: one day
[1:00:58] Dristereau: Got it today :)
[1:01:04] wEiRdO_dUdE: The legendary 2h axe is nice
[1:01:11] Judgejudyx: isnt wep 2-3%
[1:01:13] WagwanBombaClatBomba: good that i got third week then trenXD
[1:01:17] ryukotsu7: The surv mythic leggo is good?
[1:01:27] Drathimos: the intent of these changes isnt to buff or nerf phys dps. its to normalize the polarity in matchups. if it indeed does turn out that these changes have drastically changed them in an unforseen way then i'm sure they'll adjust it again with more tuning.
[1:01:36] honsou2: didnt they give every class health in s1 in the ret patch
[1:01:38] MaybeRespect: Leggo axe is Negative vers/mastery though right? So lose dmg and dr there

[1:02:34] thepartyzone: nope
[1:02:36] esqueuetv: Everyone is blowing the 4% global physical dam reduction to cloth from armor buff out of proportion
[1:02:38] MaybeRespect: Think legendary axe is worth for DK. Losing mastery and vers.
[1:02:38] SweRobb: @notmes you have leggo axe yet ?
[1:02:39] mogg_chill: Retri pog
[1:02:49] Yanzoh: Hey Mes, how's it going bud? How's the family?

[1:03:20] wEiRdO_dUdE: I can believe 4 or 5%
[1:03:20] MaybeRespect: It's more for warlocks compouding armor i thought.

[1:03:53] zachgamegodx: the fury change is so funny, you’ll never use ravager in PvP
[1:03:55] firemarcosrl: @railander you check it , after 2.4 literally most of the comps got a lock lmao
[1:03:57] Gizzlefsb: hpal gonna be made out of paper
[1:04:08] SoraSkyforge: i find wizard meta very boring and stale, makes the game unfun and boring for me
[1:04:09] Yanzoh: I found a ret build that has been doing insane dmg, so to see its getting a huge dmg increase, I'm really excited now
[1:04:09] sistahfistah1: why would wws not like it? :o
[1:04:17] firemarcosrl: @railander just becuase youre a bad lock doesnt mean lock sucks
[1:04:18] RF_Kaszual: feral gettin dmg buffs??

[1:07:03] thepartyzone: frost dk got cucked
[1:07:16] WagwanBombaClatBomba: we need the unholy pet dmg abilites buff to go thru to trenXD
[1:07:18] railander: @firemarcosrl top 100 last 2 weeks, 5 locks vs 12 dk, 7 dh, 9 rogue, 5 ret

[1:08:58] SoraSkyforge: maybe
[1:09:04] SoraSkyforge: i hope so
[1:09:11] sistahfistah1: i think everyone will be less stressed out xD
[1:09:18] railander: @MaybeRespect and? where di you think that MMR/CR got sucked out from?
[1:09:22] tarth_100: Why would DKs feel more tanky into wizards now?
[1:09:25] tarth_100: just the stam buff?

[1:09:35] SweRobb: @notmes you farm the leggo axe ?
[1:09:39] MaybeRespect: @railander Just saying man. Consideratin
[1:09:47] WagwanBombaClatBomba: blizzard doesnt listen to mes Kappa
[1:09:47] wEiRdO_dUdE: It's definitely not all bad, at the very least
[1:09:53] tarth_100: oh word, so kind of how stam for warlock gives them more healing and stuff
[1:10:01] mrxilio: @notmes games will be a bit slower correct? will allow newer players to have more time to make decisions yeah?
[1:10:07] mogleyz: Why Are they not buffing aug everyone just forgot that spec
[1:10:20] tarth_100: makes sense
[1:10:24] railander: @MaybeRespect i know but that's a non-factor. if you have 10 alts, for each one of those's rating to go up, you are funneling rating from other people you beat. why isn't there 1 lock with 10 alts dominating ladder?
[1:10:26] WagwanBombaClatBomba: holy fak make my ams unbreakable Kreygasm
[1:10:29] WagwanBombaClatBomba: trenXD
[1:10:39] pasibudo: Is warrior buffed indirectly
[1:11:12] todesfausttv: what about for tsg?
[1:11:14] todesfausttv: will tsg be good?
[1:11:17] wEiRdO_dUdE: 1.2 million health sounds beefy
[1:11:34] Old_Tomatoes: Slower as in match time, or slower as in gcd rates?
[1:11:36] MaybeRespect: the AMS buff is 33k extra absorb
[1:11:41] MaybeRespect: Not that much
[1:11:41] Shway1013: DH/Ret
[1:11:43] dankers7: @notmes do you think ferals are fine now

[1:12:02] KJKtv: yo mes samiyam told me to come here to get the Weakaura mes package?

[1:12:59] railander: rogues are for sure still OP, issue is they can solo u while also controling the game.
[1:13:03] zachgamegodx: assassinstion arcane rdudu wil dominate, the pace of the game was very similar to how you’re describing which Alec nisksi won blizzcon with RMD in legion
[1:13:13] mogleyz: They should have implemented these changes with seed of renewal
[1:13:17] serratedlove: sub prob cant 100-0 in duel after these changes
[1:13:25] tonydeezerpp: Rip Chuck as pres :D  All fear and root effects in PvP may now take 100% more damage before canceling in PvP combat.
[1:13:35] MedtnerFangirl: yessss
[1:13:54] WagwanBombaClatBomba: ret is summoned to cleanse the unholy Kappa

[1:15:35] i_wish_southbadboy: surely ill get my legendary next week after getting the badluck protection each week right
[1:16:08] pasibudo: Warriors hit harder into ret and dk right . Because arms do pure physical dmg
[1:16:15] railander: @i_wish_southbadboy Clueless shirley
[1:16:18] thepartyzone: slower game means affliction stonks are rising
[1:16:24] thepartyzone: you heard it here first assas afflic

[1:16:49] Old_Tomatoes: We need pre bugfix deathbolt
[1:16:52] wEiRdO_dUdE: I think the death rates for warlock were on the higher end, at least at lower ratings
[1:16:56] Covlol: can they do the same thing with trap since every spec in the game passively breaks it!?
[1:16:58] railander: @havenblood literally no way, it'd need 1000% change instead of 100%
[1:17:16] Itankarenas: Cdew gonna be playing an orc shaman again after the patch drops Sadge
[1:17:16] Snoogns: will death still break fear for healing priests then?
[1:17:29] Old_Tomatoes: Why was he on troll in the first place?

[1:18:48] Snoogns: SP stonks on the rise
[1:18:56] pasibudo: Warriors also have a talent that makes fear wistand more dmg before breaking. If it stacks maybe good

[1:20:22] mogleyz: Buff chaos bolt

[1:20:27] trollmasta66: Lock is going to have crazy armor due to no nerf to thier armor
[1:20:28] tonydeezerpp: cope imo xd
[1:20:34] railander: @mateus_darc no
[1:20:43] ChumpSeason: can someone explain the point of armor in pvp now?
[1:20:44] tonydeezerpp: sub been broken for so long now
[1:20:56] tonydeezerpp: maybe 20% but not 10% i dont think
[1:21:05] trollmasta66: ret is def going to change meta
[1:21:22] MaybeRespect: Sub control is a huge thing too
[1:21:26] WagwanBombaClatBomba: we love this talk
[1:21:29] tonydeezerpp: we´ll see but rogue is usally fine
[1:21:30] SweRobb: Are mes farming the leggo axe ?

[1:22:33] biofreaks: shadow priest / rogue / healer on Tuesday baby
[1:22:35] honsou2: full clear? does all the bosses drop increase drop tokens?
[1:22:43] SweRobb: SOD channMalding
[1:22:46] trollmasta66: I can take you on my war
[1:22:49] sunileif: streamer luck
[1:22:51] SirChrisike: looks like a big hit on dk.
[1:22:52] swolecolemole: wait the lego works in pvp?!
[1:22:58] laha1n: watch you get the leggo first try on ret
[1:22:59] honsou2: cant wait for next season ResidentSleeper
[1:23:01] SoraSkyforge: i was told axe is pretty meaningless for DKs, do u think its a must? @notmes
[1:23:03] nalwaah974: why u need raid on ret ?
[1:23:04] reklebin: need a body for raid?
[1:23:14] nalwaah974: is legendary that OP for ret?
[1:23:38] avenueone: @reklebin sure
[1:23:40] avenueone: pm avwar
[1:23:47] WagwanBombaClatBomba: its not huge but its minmax
[1:23:47] wEiRdO_dUdE: The channel for the axe special attack is questionable at times, but oh that item level
[1:23:57] starskedc: You think dh bm hunter x will be good
[1:24:10] honsou2: the axe ability probably hits harder than apocalypse now
[1:24:18] SirChrisike: loosing armor feels worse then thedps nerf on dk.
[1:24:45] Yanzoh: Wait they nerfed uh, did they buff frost then?
[1:24:45] ChumpSeason: @SirChrisike armor changes seem really stupid to me in general
[1:24:47] bigsturdy64: I just want my warrior to feel as tanky as a lock
[1:24:57] SweRobb: @honsou2 you have the Axe m8 ?
[1:25:01] Gideon2826: Yea but leggo has no vers
[1:25:10] Gideon2826: You will be at like 26% vers
[1:25:10] SoraSkyforge: Not sure if the health pool increases compensates for the 33.3% necro wounds nerf tbh
[1:25:11] honsou2: that actually sounds terrible
[1:25:21] honsou2: remove 5% dmg from pvp players, add 5% damage to pve players in pvp
[1:25:23] americanmoses18: i want my axeeee goddamnit
[1:25:24] anmusallam: i trust you that dk will be good, i was kinda sad when i read the notes earlier
[1:25:37] mogleyz: You can use the axe in awc
[1:26:15] buffnac: think sv is about to take over the hunt specs
[1:26:22] anmusallam: yeah it makes sense the death strike and our stamina ability
[1:26:36] starskedc: Idk legendary is ass you get stunned on the charge
[1:26:40] wraithchill: won’t ams absorb more and death strike heal more with the larger health pool as well?
[1:26:46] DizziestShot: Anyone on your team that would pair well with your ret?
[1:26:58] DizziestShot: noice
[1:27:13] MaybeRespect: Cupid no good?
[1:27:28] wEiRdO_dUdE: demo and shadow priest could be hot
[1:27:28] nalwaah974: You think ret dk uh will be good ?
[1:27:38] tarth_100: bm will do more damage to cleaves now, right?
[1:27:51] tarth_100: it does
[1:27:54] tarth_100: true
[1:28:12] MaybeRespect: BM w/ ret freedoms/bops isnt that easy to kill
[1:28:25] Gideon2826: Leggo has no vers so what gear changes do you makes to maximize vers??
[1:28:30] WagwanBombaClatBomba: demo would wanna play with mage or sp
[1:28:33] Itankarenas: lightforged dranei racial is slept on for burst
[1:28:39] Itankarenas: fite me
[1:28:54] Yanzoh: ^ lol
[1:29:21] anmusallam: is it ok if i keep my haste stacked gear
[1:29:22] starskedc: Bm ele druid sounds scary
[1:29:24] WagwanBombaClatBomba: @notmes how much versa u play with
[1:29:26] Itankarenas: not the explode on death one
[1:29:32] wEiRdO_dUdE: If we need more raw damage, haste is always nice
[1:29:43] FullyMetalz: @notmes, thank you for making the WA pack and keeping it updated. You are a god amongst men.
[1:29:45] Drathimos: why do they keep buffing health, do they seriously think this will fix dps ques?
[1:29:56] WagwanBombaClatBomba: ele dh, demo ele
[1:30:02] mogleyz: Is there changes to hunter
[1:30:15] WutFace_VS_KrippO: how big is that fear change? Susge
[1:30:16] tarth_100: What about shadow play?
[1:30:16] Covlol: @mogleyz surv 4% dmg
[1:30:24] WagwanBombaClatBomba: jazggzOMEGAKEK
[1:30:30] Itankarenas: im telling you dude, cdew is gonna be an orc again cuz of that
[1:30:32] classic_ash: are you gonna keep playing haste, mes?
[1:30:40] laha1n: blizzard hates resto shamans in pvp
[1:30:40] Shway1013: the rando restro sham nerf
[1:30:42] railander: why tf did they buff resto lava burst monkaS
[1:30:42] Itankarenas: he already talks about dying in stuns
[1:30:44] SnoopTKO: mes does unh care for these nerfs?
[1:30:44] WagwanBombaClatBomba: if train blue was a thing
[1:30:47] serratedlove: @mogleyz mm will do slightly more damage into plate and less into cloth
[1:30:48] WagwanBombaClatBomba: now its really a thing
[1:30:51] WagwanBombaClatBomba: LUL
[1:31:06] jasuvex: nerf rsham armor cause they feel so comfy qing into melee cleaves
[1:31:06] FullyMetalz: !song
[1:31:06] StreamElements: @FullyMetalz No song is current playing.
[1:31:18] WutFace_VS_KrippO: they keep buffing lock armor tho EZ
[1:31:34] FullyMetalz: What song this
[1:31:49] FullyMetalz: Ty
[1:32:26] classic_ash: Mes, how important will haste be if we stop playing doomburst?
[1:32:38] Itankarenas: more hp than my destro lock
[1:33:02] anmusallam: youll have 1202.3
[1:33:04] wEiRdO_dUdE: I think the last time we saw ret in AWC, it was like Drake running stamina gems, but I could be wrong
[1:33:05] SweRobb: Bassline Kickin (Silverback Remix) @fullymetalz
[1:33:05] railander: stam baseline is 20hp per 1
[1:33:08] WagwanBombaClatBomba: @notmes im 1101k hp with lego
[1:33:18] WutFace_VS_KrippO: how big is fear change? can destroy kill you in fear now?
[1:33:23] nalwaah974: U think DK will be playing more with pet specs ( commander ) than playing death coil ?
[1:33:32] honsou2: pay2win legendary
[1:33:33] railander: @WutFace_VS_KrippO tiny
[1:33:33] Drathimos: id always prefer to have more health and less mitigation, that means more death strike healing
[1:33:36] WagwanBombaClatBomba: 4317
[1:33:50] WagwanBombaClatBomba: 1002 stre
[1:33:53] WagwanBombaClatBomba: ye
[1:33:55] SoraSkyforge: do u find wizard meta enjoyable? (even if it benefits dks)
[1:34:14] WutFace_VS_KrippO: @railander prolly benefits affli most i guess, to not break it with dots fast
[1:34:14] WagwanBombaClatBomba: 753.9 dps
[1:34:37] anmusallam: i might disagree with that mes
[1:34:40] Itankarenas: oh wait, my lock is 1.11m
[1:34:42] railander: @WutFace_VS_KrippO not even, it'll take ~.5 sec longer to break. the biggest benefit is probably from roots.
[1:34:43] anmusallam: at least for warrior
[1:35:00] honsou2: melee cleave meta? bit overreact
[1:35:11] railander: oh wow didnt think about fw
[1:35:14] nalwaah974: U think DK will be playing more with pet specs ( commander ) than playing death coil ?
[1:35:22] railander: 5% stam plus 5% from 10.2.5
[1:35:46] wEiRdO_dUdE: SMOrc zug zug SMOrc
[1:36:38] Applezbtw: so its just gonna take longer for the hunter do die with out turtle? LUL
[1:36:49] laha1n: fast shuffles is a nightmare for me as a healer though,
[1:37:35] kitsoupne: isn't the +20% stam dks get from the talent going to stack on top of the +10% as well?
[1:37:48] nalwaah974: U think DK will be playing more with pet specs ( commander ) than playing death coil ?
[1:37:57] SirChrisike: but with dstrike  in shuffle being ass slow sucks for dk or not?
[1:38:01] railander: @laha1n i play mw and i feel like it's going to be a mana bar fest.
[1:38:08] anmusallam: i love pets :/
[1:38:16] anmusallam: :/
[1:38:34] anmusallam: so we can jump healers
[1:38:37] anmusallam: lets gooo
[1:38:51] JustTaki: I was just thinking that, all they did was nerf the our apoc burst with busting wounds build
[1:38:54] serratedlove: o7 rshams
[1:39:05] anmusallam: so dk is getting better in 2s
[1:39:21] JustTaki: yeah diseases are going to keep cranking as hard
[1:39:25] Anhak: Kermit: I need pumper mes tonight 250 dps cranker
[1:39:38] JustTaki: how do you feel about the armor nerf vs the stam buff?
[1:39:41] al_capow: coming on
[1:39:52] JustTaki: sweet
[1:40:00] anmusallam: ok but defense is good because we can still rot people down
[1:40:01] SoraSkyforge: just for reference, 10% health increase represents an increase of 109,300 HP for me (489 pvp ilvl)
[1:40:11] JustTaki: are you at all afraid of ww or warrior just eating our butts?
[1:40:19] WagwanBombaClatBomba: i swear i got so depressed when i read the changes, i came in here. depression gone jazggzOMEGAKEK
[1:40:35] honsou2: sounds so awful imo to not have any kill potential after theyve nerfed rotten/apoc/doomburst but if every class ends up not being able to kill its fine
[1:40:40] WagwanBombaClatBomba: y
[1:40:40] JustTaki: that's hella fair
[1:40:50] serratedlove: I love slow meta as assa
[1:41:05] fejiwow: does fdk actualyl like slow meta though
[1:41:10] fejiwow: this feels like it kills the spec even more
[1:41:16] honsou2: yeah that does actually sound good for dk, like 1 second pillar LOS wont kill us
[1:41:20] JustTaki: out of the melee we are one of the specs that do the least phiscal so the armor buff for clothies does feel liek it will hurt us the least
[1:41:27] SweRobb: @notmes @wagwanbombaclatbomba Mes is psychologist
[1:41:35] nalwaah974: What about frost DK ?
[1:41:37] Blaze150000: Is dk f*** up?
[1:41:40] WagwanBombaClatBomba: @SweRobb i swear
[1:41:43] WagwanBombaClatBomba: LUL
[1:41:50] honsou2: @fejiwow no
[1:41:50] Moobot: Join my Discord community! https://discord.gg/mes

[1:43:13] Itankarenas: except rshams LUL
[1:43:16] WagwanBombaClatBomba: gonna be nuts

[1:43:24] tabdotx: Demo ret back
[1:43:30] nalwaah974: what about frost DK ?
[1:43:37] anmusallam: wait rdru is no longer bis?
[1:43:40] Birthdayy: rsham didnt get any healing increases in pvp
[1:43:40] JustTaki: how big do you think the 10% evis nerf is? Seems huge since that's like a quarter of their damage
[1:44:11] whspe: holy priest got some decent buffs
[1:44:33] dmason828: I dont think the "nerf" to rdruid is actually a nerf when looking at the other tweaks they did to them
[1:44:37] WagwanBombaClatBomba: and hpala took the cok channKek
[1:44:58] nalwaah974: Dk frost any good ? ^^
[1:45:27] WagwanBombaClatBomba: frost dk is resting with arthas in the maw now
[1:45:31] WagwanBombaClatBomba: channCarl
[1:45:35] Itankarenas: there's dozens of them Mes Madge
[1:45:50] whspe: so lame
[1:46:19] krome2dadome: good fuck em
[1:46:31] SweRobb: frost dk so sad, but i dont care, unholy is still good
[1:46:58] Blaze150000: Uh will suck vs phys dmg
[1:47:40] Blaze150000: But im high damp ss death strike is bad
[1:47:41] TeamLiquid: Looking to take your gameplay to the next level? Learning a new class and would like some pointers? Head on over to our discord go.adv.gg/S0oICP to schedule a coaching session with your favorite Team Liquid raider!
[1:47:44] Drathimos: being squishier but having more health = more death strike healing
[1:47:44] dmason828: re-reading the patch notes about Rdruid you were correct in that they are getting nerfed. I also agree with what you said in that they will most likely still be in the top healing specs
[1:47:47] SweRobb: @blaze150000 5% more damage taken
[1:48:24] sewerrattus: Do you think the SV buffs will be really good for SV?
[1:48:52] Blaze150000: But lets see next week...
[1:48:54] sewerrattus: \
[1:49:14] WagwanBombaClatBomba: i had a full melee lobby, ofc i was the target and died first round. i picked up bloodforged won 2 rounds and they stop going me trenLUL
[1:49:17] Blaze150000: Otherwise. Dk affli could be fun to play now
[1:49:24] Zonnis: so they got time, but now they dont have the healing to top someone? lol
[1:49:26] Cybernytez: yoo mes i read the changes and couldnt believe my eyes man what are these armor changes LUL casters will rise so hard man
[1:49:35] buffnac: sv already pumps really hard it’s just a Hunter so it still dies
[1:49:40] chancywilson: wont hpal be nerfed b/c armor reduct?
[1:49:43] steebet: any thoughts on fury warrior?
[1:50:03] Cybernytez: the armor changes are a joke imo like what
[1:50:25] SweRobb: @blaze150000 Yea i dont play the game anymore but gona watch streams and se how it works out with the nerf
[1:50:31] notmes: !sodrunes

[1:51:07] Blaze150000: So after the nurfs dot build will be the way to go?
[1:51:27] Drathimos: i dont see why people are complaining about the armor changes. physical dmg is an outdated mechanic. getting countered because of an armor is non interactive and not fun
[1:51:51] jporter_: are these actually big changes?
[1:51:53] wEiRdO_dUdE: Those diseases were cooking people before
[1:52:08] WagwanBombaClatBomba: but the wound dmg nerf is not that big no
[1:52:12] Blaze150000: Yes this is was i was also thinkig about
[1:52:27] jporter_: lock got a little buffed
[1:52:45] jporter_: I was hoping for rogues to get a little more but all good, excited for the patch
[1:52:46] WagwanBombaClatBomba: i dont mind this meta rn tbh
[1:52:59] Drathimos: kinda weird how they keep trying to slow down the meta. it doesnt even feel fast rn
[1:53:14] WagwanBombaClatBomba: blizzard went full bazuka mode on us
[1:53:20] sunileif: buff hunter armor by 25%
[1:53:30] WutFace_VS_KrippO: did they forget to nerf armor for locks? i am lock player myself and feels weird
[1:53:37] Cybernytez: casters get huge buff with this armor change ^^ imagine mages that are kite gods already almost unkillable and locks holy moly
[1:53:42] jporter_: wonder if this is big for affliction lock
[1:53:44] wyldeshock: as a healer id rather games be fast
[1:53:44] jasuvex: blizzard is tuning the game for 1600 mmr so what can u expect
[1:53:57] honsou2: frost mages sound nasty with the 100% root buff and armor buff and stam buff
[1:54:43] krome2dadome: yes
[1:54:54] jporter_: love the 5% resto nerf
[1:55:37] sillenffs: where can i find latest patch changes
[1:56:02] SweRobb: @sillenffs Google it, easy
[1:56:11] honsou2: pets being stuck in roots to twice as much passive damage is still real
[1:56:21] WutFace_VS_KrippO: @sillenffs wowhead
[1:57:03] JustTaki: :(
[1:58:46] batu_x96: play chimera shot
[1:59:32] StreamElements: JustTaki just donated $10.00 mesWeckso mesWeckso mesDad
[1:59:37] batu_x96: its better now i think
[1:59:48] JustTaki: :)
[1:59:57] batu_x96: it hits hard but not good for mana
[2:00:31] sillenffs: @WutFace_VS_KrippO but latest i can see there is from 11 jan
[2:00:35] dicromickdk: yo
[2:00:36] dicromickdk: what the fuck
[2:00:38] dicromickdk: are these changes
[2:00:45] dicromickdk: they are bringing the retpocalypse back
[2:01:24] wEiRdO_dUdE: The Retpocalypse was insane LUL
[2:01:32] Blaze150000: But anyways. I rly enjoy your spec from yesterday with ebon fever and no sudden doom proccs. pwaffOMEGALUL
[2:03:44] leeka: was hoping theyd hit rogues vanish or something.
[2:03:44] Moobot: Tshirts, hoodies, and mugs available now! https://merch.streamelements.com/notmes
[2:04:20] Blaze150000: Rogues cloak....
[2:04:59] SweRobb: maby shadow cleave will be a good comp again
[2:05:02] Blaze150000: Did they buff rmp for awc?
[2:05:43] theodeth: did outlaws get an indirect buff to melee?
[2:05:49] TheEyeVII: so what's the bis for ya'll boomy/outlaw now?
[2:06:09] Saphilock: Am I wrong in thinking these changes look really good for some form of shadowplay to be strong
[2:06:09] Drathimos: the survivability nerf comes from the fact that they're not as threatening anymore which wont keep you defensive as much
[2:06:21] Shway1013: moonkin also got a armor nerf
[2:07:16] SweRobb: poor moonkins :D
[2:08:03] leeka: the rshaman armor nerf was a bit odd too. Dont they already have a hard time into melee?
[2:08:15] al_capow: is yours bugged?
[2:08:20] al_capow: or do you not have one saved rn?
[2:08:30] al_capow: oh sick
[2:08:46] al_capow: and yeah it makes it way nicer inbnetween
[2:09:45] swolecolemole: feel like the mastery embellishment for dk will get more value now with the hp buff? take more to get you below 90
[2:09:55] swolecolemole: instead of conduit, idk
[2:10:07] Old_Tomatoes: Warsong gulch is just a miserable grind
[2:11:42] gastly_fan: damn
[2:11:56] gastly_fan: hunter damage seems nice
[2:13:30] SweRobb: @old_tomatoes i agree, all battlegrounds is miserable, only arena that are fun and some world pvp.
[2:18:43] SweRobb: @notmes are you playing classic wotlk ?
[2:19:28] laha1n: i find no part of world pvp fun. its always a half dozen coordinated rogues killing 1 guy over and over
[2:21:04] th4les: This UI tho payoS
[2:21:44] SweRobb: @th4les dont you like it ?
[2:22:53] th4les: Not much 4Head
[2:23:15] wEiRdO_dUdE: I was watching a stream where there were some crazy guardian druids all buffed up, killing people in world PvP. In season 4 with the better tier set from season 2, they could be even meaner LUL
[2:23:45] SweRobb: @th4les little messy i agree but still ok
[2:23:45] Moobot: Join my Discord community! https://discord.gg/mes

[2:32:23] evil_primate: Do you still need arros in SOD?
[2:32:49] wEiRdO_dUdE: lots of arrows
[2:34:17] Anhak: so we got boots and then a bunch of os / alt loot
[2:35:35] JustTaki: I was just thinking that
[2:35:40] JustTaki: how many servers are there?
[2:35:48] Anhak: Should be monday i dont mind if you guys want to change to 1 a week tho idc
[2:35:55] wEiRdO_dUdE: It is neat to see a lot of people in WoW, even if it's Classic on just a couple of servers
[2:35:56] Cybernytez: they all just afking in cities bro :P
[2:36:13] Anhak: yea staffs and a few other epics and then few pieces here and there yea
[2:36:20] SweRobb: SOD seems very chilled game to play
[2:36:25] Cybernytez: retail has omega phasing no?
[2:36:56] wEiRdO_dUdE: SOD is an exciting time for those Classic people, a lot of added stuff that makes the game more interesting
[2:37:05] Anhak: i think its actually a bit healthy to delay the raid opening by like 5 days or w.e so people dont just burn their face off in 12 hours
[2:37:31] MedtnerFangirl: Sure
[2:37:42] JustTaki: I have 7 heroic fyraks done and 16 mythic boss kills for lessers am I due for my lego this week T.T
[2:37:51] dooshken: @wEiRdO_dUdE a lot of added stuff? A few abilities and a raid is a lot?
[2:37:55] Argelian2017: I’m saved up to fyrak
[2:38:21] dooshken: I suppose
[2:38:44] wEiRdO_dUdE: It's more than a few abilities, some game changers
[2:39:00] SweRobb: @dooshken think blizzard gona add more stuffs soon
[2:39:08] dooshken: I played Classic in 2020, doesn't look different enough yet
[2:39:43] dooshken: I will prolly check it out when the level cap is higher
[2:39:55] ZallKlos: just wondering, when you play ebon fever, do you tab dot everybody on enemy team?
[2:40:49] SweRobb: @dooshken good plan, it can be better then it is now
[2:45:59] Ey_an: am i too late to see the dk deletion?

[3:13:37] MedtnerFangirl: howling
[3:13:45] krome2dadome: pissing
[3:14:19] MedtnerFangirl: pre-vantus the raid
[3:14:31] mnowpsn: Can u show those talents again that u said was getting buffed Please
[3:14:38] Frostyjoneslol: do we think the rdruid nerf is gonna hurt alot i saw they helped their mana
[3:14:39] MedtnerFangirl: also set it to heroic please :3
[3:14:49] krome2dadome: i think warr is kinda boned on tuesday
[3:15:05] Talason: nezPeek
[3:15:08] NPBeharry: what are the best changes coming
[3:15:20] wEiRdO_dUdE: RIP warriors and frost DKs
[3:15:32] krome2dadome: like half our damage is bleeds so the armor change is w/e, and lots of our healing scales with hp, but yea we'll seer
[3:15:34] krome2dadome: see
[3:15:35] trollmasta66: they like to buff things warriors dont use
[3:15:48] krome2dadome: it's like 2% strength we lost
[3:15:50] krome2dadome: maybe
[3:16:03] biofreaks: warlocks going to have 1.5 mil hp
[3:16:24] Frostyjoneslol: really dont think warlocks needed a defensive buff
[3:16:30] krome2dadome: just a question of if we are able to survive in damp i think
[3:16:38] krome2dadome: not 2% overall
[3:16:47] krome2dadome: 2% from the buff
[3:17:13] trollmasta66: @krome2dadome gonna be that sit in d stance and intervene game
[3:17:33] charmsrules: lmao
[3:17:43] krome2dadome: @trollmasta66 yea fr
[3:17:45] krome2dadome: https://imgur.com/a/P69ZV9S
[3:17:46] biofreaks: MM hunter pew pew plate classes finally
[3:17:50] charmsrules: mes already on the ret after the changes I would be to
[3:17:54] krome2dadome: so let me math it out
[3:18:10] biofreaks: rogues going to shred plate
[3:18:11] krome2dadome: we have like 13k armor rn in pvp
[3:18:19] charmsrules: so what is happening
[3:18:34] the_viznar: changes seem way out in left field
[3:18:44] biofreaks: shadow play going to be cracked
[3:18:50] trollmasta66: they converting plates to clothe and cloth (locks) to plate
[3:18:50] charmsrules: they made clothies tankier than melee while still being faster and having more cc
[3:18:59] charmsrules: like who thinks is good
[3:19:04] krome2dadome: we lose like 400 main stat
[3:19:15] trollmasta66: I cant wait to sit and never target locks
[3:20:09] charmsrules: so is there any reason to play melee at this point
[3:20:09] krome2dadome: yea i mean we're legit just gonna be d stance, intervene/bladestorm bots
[3:20:13] trollmasta66: it's a lot, main stat is compounding off secondary stat. Monks lost 100k damage from their sun kick with the trinket stat change
[3:20:17] krome2dadome: with piss little stuns that never matter
[3:20:29] krome2dadome: gonna be super fun
[3:20:31] trollmasta66: @krome2dadome you maybe, I'm gonna play ret. :)
[3:20:32] krome2dadome: thanks blizzard
[3:21:03] charmsrules: that and healers are even more unkillable than before
[3:21:08] trollmasta66: @krome2dadome if you think about it, ret and war are trading roles. from support to damage
[3:21:36] krome2dadome: @trollmasta66 im a dh main now
[3:22:00] trollmasta66: @krome2dadome oh so you get to chuckle for the warriors as you melt them
[3:22:31] greasymalz: chat how long does it take to get a fresh acc ready for areans?
[3:22:33] greasymalz: arenas
[3:23:34] Triknology: a couple of days to get arena ready
[3:23:43] krome2dadome: how did warrior somehow get more boned than dh, dk, rogue, and boomy?
[3:24:38] AethrosTempest: 80% of all damage ignores armor anyway rn
[3:24:42] AethrosTempest: magic + bleeds
[3:24:42] michaelss_: warriors are going to eat dks now
[3:24:44] krome2dadome: not in the slightest
[3:24:46] michaelss_: which they already did
[3:24:54] wEiRdO_dUdE: They might have been looking at survivability rates
[3:25:01] atoker: unfortunate massive nerf to dks
[3:25:33] krome2dadome: @notmes do i gear trinketcanc or beefdaddyk?
[3:25:37] krome2dadome: sanc*
[3:26:11] atoker: yeah, but they also nerfed dk damage and healing absorbtion
[3:26:28] bornbetter: wait so is frost mage just going to be busted now...?
[3:26:29] Moobot: Tshirts, hoodies, and mugs available now! https://merch.streamelements.com/notmes
[3:26:59] AethrosTempest: from a DK perspective I don't think we care about the cloth armor changes at all, do we?
[3:27:01] healmeshammy: where is cdew?
[3:27:04] krome2dadome: mes i need an answer papi
[3:27:23] mnowpsn: He's not feeling well
[3:27:26] Blaze150000: i have in pvp combat 11 427 armor with dk 489 gs. 30.78% phys dmg reduction... so this means i will have with the tunings only 20% dmg reduction ?
[3:27:28] mnowpsn: He said on tweet
[3:27:41] healmeshammy: oh
[3:27:52] Hellgodsito: Can I get an inv? im gnomeconocen  GivePLZ
[3:28:18] mnowpsn: Aren't these changes good for outlaw/fury too since they do more dmg into less armor
[3:28:22] MedtnerFangirl: Hunter's Mark I guess
[3:28:23] adventxcloud: Mes, this is going to be a tough clear once we hit nymue/smolderon
[3:28:30] krome2dadome: ok i chose trinketsanc
[3:28:42] adventxcloud: Most of these people are less than 7/9 heroic
[3:29:26] adventxcloud: yeah but you paid for a carry

[3:43:13] TheHunterStatistic: @notmes what gladius version do u use for 3's now? seems mines all bugged out
[3:43:14] dawsonator171: that biden impression was a whole lot of mumbling, which is accurate.
[3:43:57] wEiRdO_dUdE: 200K people....yeah that's good
[3:44:24] dawsonator171: I was hoping DK but that might be a big lift.

[4:02:54] Boossterr: leggo farming?

[4:06:05] wEiRdO_dUdE: Frost mage will be a bit harder to kill
[4:06:27] dawsonator171: I would prefer the natural mage predator, hunter, to hard fuck mages.
[4:06:37] charmsrules: and they got more armor for when anything does reach them it does less and so mm hunter won’t do as good into then
[4:06:51] avenueone: this fight u go aoe spec
[4:06:57] sunileif: i had one job T^T kill the clothie T^T
[4:07:42] charmsrules: but again I must ask why on earth would you ever be melee after this

[4:20:03] americanmoses18: if mes gets leggo on ret first kill mannnnn
[4:20:32] enviscerate: you dont need avoidance if you just avoid the damage 4Head
[4:21:54] whspe: @notmes are we in danger of our ret overlords?
[4:22:25] omkar3108: PogChamp
[4:23:05] dawsonator171: that could be me dead riding coat tails
[4:23:39] dawsonator171: you'd have to call me moses though
[4:24:16] americanmoses18: lol last raid i was in with daws he died 3x more than me

[4:26:09] avenueone: thats fine mes
[4:26:14] avenueone: the #2 dps can waste globals n res
[4:26:46] avenueone: intercession
[4:26:48] intoxxz: Can someone link me class changes please?

[4:27:06] intoxxz: Ty @notmes
[4:27:15] Zacaree55: Mes you need a healer for heroic?
[4:27:23] Zacaree55: I can log on my 478 priest and come help.

[4:28:47] Zacaree55: ill come bang the healing
[4:29:08] Zacaree55: And yes i have aotc lol
[4:29:25] mouro52: Resubbing cuz of these patch notes
[4:29:27] mouro52: ret here we go
[4:29:58] mouro52: Do you think the UH nerfs are big?
[4:30:05] mouro52: They just look at solo shuffle i think
[4:30:11] overrrlord12: randomly ? more like sus
[4:30:14] dawsonator171: this warlock is from moon guard and RPing a harry potter wizard.
[4:30:23] robdudeguylol: ww and uh nerfs feel bad
[4:30:29] Zacaree55: Whose the highest DPS in the grp?
[4:30:32] Zacaree55: and are they getting PI
[4:30:36] trollmasta66: ret is weaker now than it was last patch
[4:30:37] mouro52: Look at solo shuffle 2.4k+ rating and it makes a bit more sense
[4:30:38] dawsonator171: why did they nerf plate armor though
[4:30:42] dawsonator171: super sus
[4:30:44] Vendrek: Vanguards is going to make a team and win AWC Cup 1 just off of patch buffs...
[4:30:50] sunileif: drunk intern made the changes NODDERS
[4:30:57] avengis33: Ret demo again in AWC?
[4:31:03] trollmasta66: I'm thinking they are increases damage to pad for skill
[4:31:13] saiyan333: the toolkit ret brings compared to warrior too...
[4:31:22] mouro52: For reference its 85 rets at 2.4k+ and 124 warrs
[4:31:24] mouro52: In shuffle
[4:31:29] mouro52: but the buffs are extreme for sure
[4:32:04] enviscerate: they should buff assa since only 12 are 2.4+ :^)
[4:32:05] mouro52: at 2.2k+ its 363 warrs and 214 rets
[4:32:31] mouro52: They should remake assa and cb rogue so they dont use shadow dance :D
[4:32:31] Moobot: Join my Discord community! https://discord.gg/mes
[4:32:38] Amoureuxlol: ppl acting like warlocks arnt going to continue to be the most broken class since release
[4:32:59] enviscerate: @mouro52 I agree, bring back gushing wounds instead for assa
[4:33:18] Amoureuxlol: "ret buffs extreme" while theres double lock awc teams
[4:33:25] mouro52: All 3 rogue specs revolve around the same cooldowns it feels like
[4:33:36] mouro52: Yeah but we're looking at solo shuffle stats
[4:33:39] mouro52: not AWC stats
[4:34:10] hamezramirez: have you got the leggo on any characters?
[4:34:13] mouro52: They dont buff only according to what its played in the pro scene anymore
[4:34:19] mouro52: they focus much more on casuals
[4:34:20] serratedlove: dance should be sub only and bring back marked for death for assa only imo
[4:34:27] mouro52: and casual locks arent good
[4:34:59] serratedlove: because marking someone for death as an 'assassin'
[4:35:00] al_capow: I wonder if they could make solo shuffle queues better by not just having an overall mmr bracket, but by having a GS bracket with mmr inside each GS bracket
[4:35:24] al_capow: so you could join after last playing like S1 for example and be in like a 424 bracket
[4:35:30] mouro52: agree with that amaiy
[4:36:25] krome2dadome: not even close
[4:36:37] MedtnerFangirl: that was fun
[4:36:38] serratedlove: @al_capow but couldnt people technically stay 424 and just farm up to high rating?
[4:36:40] wEiRdO_dUdE: Cool
[4:36:41] MedtnerFangirl: Disc OP
[4:37:03] krome2dadome: need on it mes
[4:37:10] trollmasta66: that is why disc is SSS++ in M+
[4:37:15] krome2dadome: nice roll
[4:37:16] al_capow: @amaiyumebaka well yes and no, because youd still run into a high mmr twink runners for that bracket
[4:37:26] al_capow: but it would actually open up the availability of pvp to more players
[4:37:30] Zacaree55: I was keeping up with him for a min
[4:37:31] Zacaree55: but he overtook me
[4:37:32] Zacaree55: =(
[4:37:35] al_capow: and prevent it from being a gear lock on top of a skill lock
[4:37:36] Zacaree55: Then i died.
[4:37:38] Zacaree55: Which really fucked me
[4:37:56] MedtnerFangirl: :3
[4:38:10] krome2dadome: UwU
[4:38:15] adventxcloud: so uh
[4:38:20] adventxcloud: tindral will be interesting
[4:40:17] dawsonator171: Thoughts on SP buffs and the armor changes for SP, because I feel they were already semi tanky.
[4:42:25] dawsonator171: mes, have you thought about bringing back Tsunami?
[4:43:02] dawsonator171: you and Ave could lead teh comeback tour
[4:43:40] krome2dadome: toonami
[4:46:28] Zacaree55: You not running double freedom Mes?
[4:46:36] Degenr8t: did they announce the changes
[4:46:37] Boossterr: tank missed shroom
[4:46:42] Zacaree55: Need that double freedom :P
[4:46:43] Boossterr: it exploded on raid
[4:46:46] Zacaree55: It does
[4:46:48] Zacaree55: 300k per tick
[4:47:54] Boossterr: shroom won’t wipe you but a lot of guys were decently low this fight is much easier with less people a lot of coordination with more
[4:48:18] Zacaree55: Dont forget dbl freedom mes
[4:49:13] Vanguarded: Do you want some help
[4:49:18] Vanguarded: I can jump on my mythic dude
[4:49:38] Boossterr: freedom dh second set of roots they pump if they can dash he should meta immune first set
[4:50:37] Necrootide: First platform is 70% second is 40% hard transitions

[4:58:40] dawsonator171: I died for the seeds
[4:58:41] radnod: Pulled out the ret after looking at the patch notes eh? LUL
[4:59:09] Necrootide: Also, he is time based with hard percent cut offs. 70% for first platform 40% for second
[4:59:30] wowsuomi: Tbf his always played ret
[4:59:37] Necrootide: Yes
[5:00:28] krome2dadome: i've always played ret too haha :)

[5:09:07] Zacaree55: Got a couple attempts in me Mes then i gotta head out
[5:09:22] dawsonator171: maybe if I pull wiht a legendary on I'll get the legendary.
[5:09:55] anmusallam: Mes does gloom ward stack with will of the necro
[5:10:26] radnod: Did you know priests can life grip add in this fight? I didn't until I saw some people on a mythic attempt
[5:10:46] dankNstein_: you can rescue them too
[5:10:50] dankNstein_: just like the larodar trees
[5:10:53] krome2dadome: @anmusallam will of the necropolis is coded as an absorb, so yes, gloom ward buffs it
[5:10:57] dawsonator171: don't inspect me mes, I'm testing a theory .
[5:10:59] Necrootide: 4
[5:11:04] sunileif: 4 shouldnt get to the 4th
[5:11:22] reklebin: @radnod evokers can rescue the heal adds also
[5:11:25] radnod: Thays crazy so like the adds are part of the raid I guess?
[5:11:49] Zacaree55: Just be prepared im only here for a couple of pulls. If we wipe a couple times i may step out. its getting late here.
[5:11:52] radnod: I wonder what else you can do with them
[5:12:05] dawsonator171: time for a wicked pisser?
[5:12:10] reklebin: you can grip and rescue adds on larodar also
[5:12:16] Zacaree55: I could step out now and you can try to get another healer to replace. Thats up to you Mes
[5:12:28] frostynu: why is everyone using the hellbloom impaler?
[5:12:57] Vanguarded: i can help in like 20 minutes lol

[5:40:31] radnod: Shouldn't you lust in phase 2 cause it's timed and applies to phase 3?
[5:41:01] dankNstein_: should not l ust p2
[5:41:25] Vanguarded: you COULD lust off the bat if your dps is slow enough and then last but normally 3

[5:49:32] dawsonator171: Evoker had exploded on adds with blaze when he rescue attempted.
[5:49:46] krome2dadome: is ele the best caster on tuesday?
[5:49:54] radnod: I was thinking tho if fryakk is down for 45s in p2 itll make p3 alot shorter since it's timed and not % base
[5:50:12] frostynu: is warrior still trash in shuffle?
[5:50:16] MedtnerFangirl: this has to be my last pull really
[5:50:16] dawsonator171: mes is the best caster on tuesday

[6:49:24] Ratkingdomdh: u could gear an alt in a day i think
[6:49:28] serratedlove: mespera to rank 1 with the changes?
[6:49:29] Ratkingdomdh: to max ilvl
[6:49:53] serratedlove: stam buff will help a bit
[6:50:03] Ratkingdomdh: from these changes they just want everyone to live forever?
[6:50:23] avenueone: big damp games
[6:50:25] avenueone: inc
[6:50:54] xiliketurtlex: wouldnt dk die to physical comps really fast since they are nerfing armor???
[6:51:01] krome2dadome: yes
[6:51:16] Ratkingdomdh: ive been trying to help a friend in 3v3 and i cna barely tell him what to press without him dying as i say it LUL
[6:51:21] serratedlove: locks have demon skin and extra stam :^)
[6:51:21] Ratkingdomdh: so game is very fast
[6:53:11] Drathimos: what about diminishing returns
[6:54:01] Drathimos: armor scaling LUL
[6:54:12] avenueone: bit over 6% for locks ye?
[6:54:42] Yacuza: How much Mastery do you want as UH
[6:54:57] shugguls: its 4%
[6:54:57] Cahirs: Would u recommend Warrior or DK for healer who wants to go DPS in PvP? :D
[6:55:13] xiliketurtlex: yea but ret has bop bubble and shield
[6:55:13] Moobot: Tshirts, hoodies, and mugs available now! https://merch.streamelements.com/notmes
[6:55:20] Eradivyn: how much haste do you get
[6:55:22] xiliketurtlex: dk has ibf
[6:55:25] Eradivyn: for unholy
[6:55:33] avenueone: 32%
[6:56:00] Eradivyn: 32% haste?
[6:56:01] Drathimos: hardly a scratch
[6:56:05] theodeth: That's good
[6:56:19] shugguls: dont forget as amrs u lose str due to the talent on armour
[6:56:33] peterpaind: what is the damage difference againt current target when oyu remove %30 armor
[6:56:56] healhut: Physical DR = armor/(armor +K)
[6:57:30] peterpaind: they are different when you hit pvp dummy tho
[6:57:37] avenueone: ret got blessing of dusk up alot too
[6:57:40] avenueone: for 10% extra armor
[6:57:47] healhut: K is about 26000 for full conq gear
[6:58:07] thunderstud25: goood morning
[6:58:12] krome2dadome: what's the plan boss
[6:58:43] Drathimos: wonder what the dr gain looks like for cloth
[6:58:48] fearsii: i see you ditched the darkness for the light my fellow brother of the crusade
[6:59:12] Drathimos: well then these are very insignificant changes
[6:59:25] Drathimos: ppl made it seem like the sky was falling LUL
[7:00:22] healhut: Yeah I don't think it matters much. Maybe locks will need to have their armor scaling adjusted a bit or something
[7:00:31] healhut: stam bonus seems more impactful
[7:01:50] Eradivyn: how much haste is good for unholy
[7:02:37] avenueone: you matter mes
[7:02:53] krome2dadome: ave matters
[7:02:55] healhut: i guess it matters vs something like outlaw maybe?
[7:03:01] serratedlove: my armor against current target is different in wm (27.13%) , against pvp dummy (31.14%)  and in a skirm (17.66%) monkaHmm as leather
[7:03:05] xaviorn7575: Wait so casters about to me OP?
[7:03:08] healhut: true
[7:03:24] avenueone: so plate will be equal to leather?
[7:03:48] krome2dadome: no
[7:03:53] healhut: i notice on marks hunter
[7:04:00] krome2dadome: casters feel tankier than plate most of the time
[7:04:01] ChumpSeason: why even have armor then.
[7:04:13] jepsc: ret pal OP on tuesday ?
[7:04:31] krome2dadome: even if the armor doesn't matter, it's the principle
[7:04:31] thunderstud25: idk I never noticed armor on my warrior
[7:04:48] eMBeaR64oz: getting ready for battle for shadowlands with the ret I see
[7:04:58] krome2dadome: oi mike

[7:06:20] krome2dadome: i mean im down to play it
[7:06:27] Ratkingdomdh: i like hearing dh's getting better
[7:06:28] krome2dadome: but im not just gonna rando run at healers all game
[7:06:43] krome2dadome: feel like that was troll
[7:06:50] Chillinar: why not? @krome2dadome zug zug healers to death
[7:07:11] eMBeaR64oz: i can play but no promise in skill level atm
[7:07:14] Ratkingdomdh: DH's murder healers in stun swaps with essence break
[7:07:25] krome2dadome: yea ik. last time we played u told me to run at the healer
[7:07:33] krome2dadome: just saying im not gonna jsut run at the healer all game
[7:07:34] gumbot27: hey mes when your on dk do u tab target or arena123
[7:08:28] peterpaind: i feel like dk is not going to cut it anymore with damage nerfs and stam buffs

[7:09:27] BabaBeutlin: Is there a reason on why u have only lik 1 or 2 characters per realm instead of all on one?
[7:09:28] goatskull123: Next week we get more stamina so I guess deathstrike is a bit buffed lol
[7:09:38] antifuntime: @notmes dont you think with armor nerfs for plate, and lock already having high armor, that demo lock is going to be nuts?
[7:11:25] boostgold7: Did i miss his thoughts on the unholy nerfs?
[7:11:36] avenueone: he went over them at start of stream
[7:11:41] avenueone: and doesnt think they are very big nerfs
[7:11:48] Time_Limits: Unholy nerf and frost death knight receive nothing. What a great game.
[7:11:58] goatskull123: they aren't big nerfs
[7:12:04] goatskull123: esp for disease build
[7:12:08] Time_Limits: time to drop Death knight completely
[7:12:14] boostgold7: really? 18% necrotic down from 24% seems alot to me and the plate nerfs? Bm hunters are gonna be ran down
[7:12:20] Time_Limits: the biggest nerf is the universal armor nerf
[7:12:28] Time_Limits: and the necrotic wound nerf
[7:12:32] Time_Limits: is pretty dumb
[7:12:37] goatskull123: we might have to play bloodforged now
[7:12:43] BabaBeutlin: Is there a reason on why u have only lik 1 or 2 characters per realm instead of all on one?
[7:12:48] goatskull123: deathstrike will heal for more since we get more stamina from the trinket bonus
[7:13:18] boostgold7: This is why im here... So mes can do the math and make me not depressed today
[7:13:44] goatskull123: with veteran of the third war, that stamina buff is sweet
[7:13:59] Itankarenas: Vanguards cleave is back EZ
[7:14:00] boostgold7: I think bm are gonna tear through plate even more now
[7:14:03] goatskull123: I think holy pala is gona be in a bad spot tho
[7:14:06] isseswagger: PLATE ARMOR NERFED finally
[7:14:06] goatskull123: with the armor nerf
[7:14:20] Time_Limits: yeah but then the damage u do is like maybe overall 20% worst.
[7:14:22] indithedog: LOL
[7:14:33] goatskull123: BM was already doing most of its dmg from their bleed
[7:14:36] Time_Limits: not so much for dot build
[7:14:40] goatskull123: which is not affected by armor
[7:14:51] jepsc: !addons

[7:14:58] Time_Limits: but the chances for u to even kill is probably way less
[7:15:19] goatskull123: poeple are still dying in 3 globals
[7:15:20] Moobot: Join my Discord community! https://discord.gg/mes
[7:15:30] Time_Limits: festering wound nerf is pretty big. Death coil nerf is fine
[7:16:12] kitsoupne: how can losing 30% of your armor only be 3% though? that would mean that you have ~10% mitigation overall atm 🤔
[7:16:18] Itankarenas: Are you just supposed to sit still with your thumb up your ass during mind games?
[7:17:13] Time_Limits: but then frost mage got a nice big buff to their glacial spike cuz of tierset and now will be even more tanky. Rogue got a nice slap on the back
[7:17:37] Time_Limits: idk, unholy will probably be fine I guess? But u will probably struggle to kill things now
[7:18:06] Time_Limits: and the ret paladin getting a big buff while frost dk is ehhh.... oh wait FDK is a shell of it former self. It  is no longer a spec
[7:18:17] Cantbemilked: nice big buff to glacial ? wut
[7:18:22] Time_Limits: i can see why fdk didnt get a buff :)
[7:18:25] bubkex: rets getting buffed in pve
[7:18:27] bubkex: not pvp
[7:18:33] bubkex: right?
[7:18:35] boostgold7: think spell cleaves are just gonna dominate once again now
[7:18:48] Cantbemilked: ret buffs are pvp too
[7:18:50] boostgold7: pvp also :/
[7:18:52] Time_Limits: @bubkex no
[7:18:58] Time_Limits: cuz it would've said not apply to pvp.
[7:19:07] Itankarenas: the rot
[7:19:10] zkrauss1: where can I find the new patch notes
[7:19:21] Chillinar: https://www.bluetracker.gg/wow/topic/eu-en/491135-class-tuning-incoming-24-january/
[7:19:25] Time_Limits: I guess it is best to push SS or whatever rated with unholy now b4 the nerf fuck yall over
[7:19:27] Time_Limits: for kills
[7:19:38] zkrauss1: thanks @chillinar
[7:20:04] Astriaxwarr: are those changes for warrior affecting pvp aswell?
[7:20:08] Time_Limits: DH are still doing disgusting amount of dps, didn't get touched this time lol
[7:20:42] mortalz93: @Time_Limits dk will still stay playable bro xd
[7:20:46] fear_law: time dont tell them
[7:21:07] Time_Limits: 4% buff to fdk but not apply to pvp LOLOLOL
[7:21:11] Time_Limits: that made me laugh
[7:21:12] Itankarenas: @mortalz93 nah, I already deleted mine
[7:21:15] Itankarenas: shit class now
[7:21:16] Time_Limits: ^
[7:21:18] Time_Limits: literally.
[7:21:18] Itankarenas: Kappa
[7:22:26] Time_Limits: @mortalz93 yeah playable cuz there gotta be ppl using em for sure XD. DK is just going to get destroyed fast in some case and the chances to finish someone off is a lot lower now
[7:22:27] afriKENx: disgusting players
[7:22:28] afriKENx: unreal
[7:22:40] Time_Limits: might probably feel like season 1 unholy who knows
[7:22:43] afriKENx: splayers**
[7:22:46] Ratkingdomdh: i wonder if Splay is good
[7:23:22] Time_Limits: Splay is.... hmm.... they r decent at best
[7:23:36] Time_Limits: spriest damage is scary asf
[7:23:37] Itankarenas: holy fuckin meatballs
[7:23:45] anacronz: is this playback?
[7:23:51] Chillinar: mes beatboxing is back Pog
[7:23:52] Itankarenas: this is live
[7:24:02] Time_Limits: u would think spriest is trash but then they randomly suck ur life away like a succubus
[7:24:03] Itankarenas: @Chillinar boots cats bro
[7:24:20] mortalz93: @Time_Limits why u complaining about ret buffs xD did u saw how many rets played this season in shuffle and 3s ?
[7:24:45] Itankarenas: I dont think I've even queued with a ret in shuffle KEKW
[7:25:29] Moobot: Please be sure to ask permission before posting links in chat! (@boostgold7)
[7:27:00] anacronz: @notmes hey is warrior gonna be dead after the armor nerf?
[7:27:06] Itankarenas: @boostgold7 he has a really high 3s rating cosidering how shit his shuffle is
[7:27:26] Itankarenas: after 400 games, has to be boosted
[7:28:08] boostgold7: for sure, rival xp every season than rockets to 2.6 xD
[7:28:58] serratedlove: that's def a piloted boost with that winrate and exp
[7:28:58] Time_Limits: @mortalz93 it is because spec that actually really underperforming didn't even get anything at all. I know ret need some help lol
[7:30:08] Time_Limits: @anacronz ehhh u won't get effected that much
[7:30:32] Time_Limits: if anything DK are the one getting hurt the most by the armor nerf
[7:33:21] Time_Limits: cant wait to see frost mage throw out a random 500k+ glacial spike next week with their tierset having that pvp reduction bonus removed

[9:23:09] Nihilistyx90: idk, feel like i could have achieved 2400 this season on dk. not anymore though.
[9:23:32] anacronz: mostly all damage coming from non physical why all cloths so happy?
[9:24:24] Nihilistyx90: @anacronz hunters, monks, warriors, outlaw rogues
[9:24:24] waitimdesyncd: There are still some pretty insane damage builds for DK,even though it sucks being nerfed as  DK.
[9:24:35] waitimdesyncd: but DK also gets hella extra stam
[9:24:48] anacronz: so warrios is gonna be bad?
[9:25:18] ItsYaBoyOOH: DK still gets run down even with extra stam
[9:25:45] Nihilistyx90: i dont mean the damage nerfs. dks dealt too much dam ( although: why didnt dhs, wws, bms, locks etc. didnt get nerfs but unholy did? kinda unfair) the armor nerfs are too much
[9:26:05] waitimdesyncd: DK being nerfed before DH is par for the course as they say
[9:26:11] Nihilistyx90: we already struggle so hard vs physical damage. now we are completely screwed
[9:26:22] waitimdesyncd: dk mains will never be surprised over that Kappa
[9:26:29] ItsYaBoyOOH: is dk did too much damage then what is monk and dh damage?

[9:31:12] anacronz: dont forget we get stamina buff dps
[9:31:18] waitimdesyncd: necro wound will still (likely) be our biggest defensive, on the breakdowns of healing I would think
[9:31:31] Nihilistyx90: i dont have any numbers unfortunately. its just the experience of being hit hard with the nerf bat.
[9:32:32] ItsYaBoyOOH: I don’t even think the stam buff means a lot when you got a monk/ war/ bm hunter sitting on you whole game
[9:32:47] waitimdesyncd: Dk being nerfed before DH is going to be a whole meme for me, thats for sure, though :D
[9:33:34] waitimdesyncd: @ItsYaBoyOOH  But as it appears right now, one of the R1 builds for DK does basically full damage while kiting, to the whole enemy team'
[9:34:51] ItsYaBoyOOH: yeah dot build with plaguebringer does a lot of rot dam

[9:43:21] Nihilistyx90: patrick is playing the standard clawing build as it seems
[9:43:54] Nihilistyx90: i know we could go plaguebringer though
[9:44:01] waitimdesyncd: @Nihilistyx90  yeah he changed it yesterda, but getting to the r1 was ebon fever plaguebringer
[9:44:27] Nihilistyx90: im just worreid about our defense
[9:45:47] waitimdesyncd: If you use your toolkit, and change talents for matchups then defensively I feel ike DK will be fine
[9:47:11] waitimdesyncd: You can play the ebonfever, plagebringer with no sudden doom and take bloodforged armor vs phys teams, and then the 10-15% dam increase we take from phys will be countered by the 20% phys dam reduc. i think it invites theory crafting
[9:47:54] waitimdesyncd: put on a battlemaster ;D
[9:47:55] Nihilistyx90: i mean if bms or monks focus me right now i feel like im just dead. and how would i try to kite them, especially on maps like blades edge. i can only imgine this will get worse next week.
[9:48:03] waitimdesyncd: for omega HP and deathstrikes ;D'
[9:48:13] waitimdesyncd: You shouldnt really die to monks tho

[9:49:04] Nihilistyx90: i have less problems with monk, but if i cant kill the bm fast enough im just dead
[9:49:21] waitimdesyncd: You dont really kill BMs like that
[9:49:35] waitimdesyncd: they have the lowest death rate in a lot of brackets
[9:49:46] Nihilistyx90: this is at 2k on EU btw

[10:02:32] Wrathbb1: @vjsnakefarm I just googled "blue tracker" popped right up
[10:02:39] waitimdesyncd: @Wrathbb1  everyone als ogot more stamina
[10:02:47] reedthesham: the fear and root changes are interesting
[10:02:57] vjsnakefarm: Ty
[10:03:07] Wrathbb1: @waitimdesyncd yeah bot only ret and SP got sizable PVP damage buffs
[10:03:13] Wrathbb1: see how that goes
[10:03:54] waitimdesyncd: @Wrathbb1  because they lowkey need then, if everyone got 10% more hp for free, (some classes scale with stam to get 20-40% more)  then SPriest and ret would have no chance on reset
[10:04:01] waitimdesyncd: need them*
[10:04:21] honsou2: why would ret and sp have no chance on reset ?
[10:04:31] honsou2: theyre both specs that benefit from longer games
[10:04:39] waitimdesyncd: because ret has the lowest win rate of any spec
[10:05:09] waitimdesyncd: and spriest has the highest death rate, so if those two classes have to face 10% stronger enemies they would be struggling
[10:05:32] honsou2: @waitimdesyncd they would themselves also be 10% stronger so they arent facing stronger enemies, and they both benefit from more health and slower games
[10:05:49] waitimdesyncd: being 10% stronger if youre the lowest spec isnt a lot
[10:06:12] honsou2: @waitimdesyncd nope true, it just wouldnt be worse after the patch
[10:06:21] waitimdesyncd: for science!
[10:07:05] Wrathbb1: @waitimdesyncd Oh I wasnt saying they didnt I was just pointing it out that they got buffed, along SP
[10:07:28] waitimdesyncd: @Wrathbb1  yeah, ret and spriest buffs were very much expected
[10:07:42] shugguls: what u testing?
[10:07:47] xDroozyy: think frost DK might feel a little better after the fear and root buff?
[10:07:59] Itankarenas: take all your gear off and put on one piece at a time
[10:08:06] Itankarenas: that’d be the easiest
[10:08:29] waitimdesyncd: it scales vs ilvl of enemy too right?
[10:08:31] honsou2: @xDroozyy will feel worse because its less burst meta
[10:09:09] waitimdesyncd: Didnt armor change depending on who you had targetted
[10:09:18] waitimdesyncd: if you look at armor it says with gray "against target"
[10:09:23] krome2dadome: there's a lot of weird scaling going on with pvp mode / targeting and shit
[10:09:23] futfutfutku: does earth shield give armor?
[10:09:31] waitimdesyncd: ye
[10:09:53] waitimdesyncd: @krome2dadome  ahaaha you never know. In BFA we had some funky scaling LUL

[10:10:14] xDroozyy: @honsou2 is frost dmg considered physical dmg?
[10:10:32] waitimdesyncd: @eMBeaR64oz  was very good to watch to for playing
[10:10:36] waitimdesyncd: ty*
[10:10:37] honsou2: @xDroozyy No everyone gets more stamina
[10:10:41] serratedlove: check it in a skirmish, the numbers completely changed for me in arena

[10:12:49] Itankarenas: Well the upcoming tuning made me think so. I could be wrong
[10:12:57] krome2dadome: so mail has more physical damage reduction than plate?
[10:12:57] figurines: The stamina buffs offset the armor nerf for plate?
[10:13:03] eMBeaR64oz: man how did druids used to heal without treants i swear, its 25% of my heals every game
[10:14:22] figurines: The armor changes seem to be a whole lot of hype and not a lot of actually changing the meta. More interested in how it affects warlocks. and the ret changes. Not at the high end but us middling plebs will get fucked by this
[10:14:23] serratedlove: doesnt add up that 30% armor is only 3% reduction monkaHmm
[10:14:47] krome2dadome: @figurines for everything but warrior*
[10:14:55] figurines: It really seems like they are balancing around mid-ish tier solo shuffle. I say this as an average player
[10:15:28] figurines: @krome2dadome Warrior is always fine. ALWAYS. getttouttahere
[10:15:42] waitimdesyncd: Mes Got a good brain in him
[10:15:57] eMBeaR64oz: yeah
[10:15:59] Itankarenas: there’s a lot about locks that doesnt make sense
[10:16:03] eMBeaR64oz: thats what i said earlier!
[10:16:06] Itankarenas: like why tf do they still have mana
[10:16:08] indithedog: LULW
[10:16:13] eMBeaR64oz: if it scales with demonskin its literally 1k less armor than war
[10:16:17] figurines: There's a reason why people love playing warlock lol
[10:16:22] opticalaccuarcy: HeyGuys
[10:16:22] honsou2: blanket changes like 35% armor on all cloth is really involved developer work LUL
[10:16:27] figurines: great passive defensives that you can't throw the game by not pressing
[10:16:34] Itankarenas: it’s why I like getting trained as destro
[10:16:43] SacsTvT: @notmes with less melee, more casters. Wont dh and bm stocks go up a bit?
[10:16:46] LichbornHQ: warlock meta
[10:16:46] Itankarenas: we’re built different
[10:16:53] sunileif: its how locks can ignore machanic sin raid and be shitty
[10:16:56] honsou2: the armor changes are like a direct result of a lot of forum posts about hunter damage into mage LUL
[10:17:12] sunileif: makes sense
[10:17:19] figurines: Remember in BfA when it as double destro? *crying in 2019*
[10:17:27] xDroozyy: did blizz not test this change in PTR like wtf
[10:17:27] sunileif: one has demon skin other has corpse skin
[10:17:37] sunileif: thematically its sound
[10:17:58] eMBeaR64oz: called death knight becuase they are dead
[10:18:00] krome2dadome: obviously dresses provide more protection and breastplates
[10:18:02] eMBeaR64oz: thematically correct
[10:18:08] waitimdesyncd: Death Knight is the class to be nerfed before DHs and have less armor than warlocks Sadge
[10:18:11] honsou2: @sunileif thematically "armor" and "skin" dont really match up
[10:18:20] Nihilistyx90: yup we are dead knights Kappa
[10:18:26] sunileif: @sunileif demon skin
[10:18:55] eMBeaR64oz: this is a kinda more minor thing but with the talent and update change priest fears with take 175% more dam
[10:18:55] honsou2: laziness + time constraints
[10:19:03] crazycorgis: warlock dark pact getting hugeass buff too
[10:19:04] eMBeaR64oz: didnt get pre nerfed like warlock fear or druid root
[10:19:05] Brunduru: you would think they already tested it with every class
[10:19:18] wowsuomi: Spriest will be good by end of season cope
[10:19:27] Brunduru: but seems warlock are gonna be very tanky
[10:19:35] sunileif: i swear tuning changes are based on someone throwing a dart at a board of ideas and w/e gets it gets implemented
[10:19:47] coldgrayrain: ngl i feel like this armor change is another step away from mmo stats mattering
[10:19:49] xDroozyy: snupyCope snupyCope snupyCope
[10:19:57] wowsuomi: Ill let u know when i see one
[10:20:09] shugguls: its like , do they know the armour nurfs warrior strength
[10:20:15] reedthesham: I don't think they know
[10:20:20] reedthesham: They will after the changes
[10:20:23] Midsommar: Bikini Warriors incoming
[10:20:30] dankgamer97: Mes, what's your take on the changes ? the plate nerf looks weird
[10:20:33] xDroozyy: what scares me most is rogue didnt get nerfed in armor, and they get stam buff
[10:20:35] reedthesham: They didn'tbuff enhance >.> :(
[10:20:36] figurines: I think it's like "pvp is more popular when these specs are meta". So they just buff them up cluelessly when numbers fall.
[10:21:04] xDroozyy: RPS gonna be unkillable
[10:21:13] Vexplicito: Yo Mes do you have a link to your BD settings somewhere?
[10:21:34] figurines: Sub rogue: Who asked for two vanishes and cloak immunity? Why even add it into the game. Do they consult anyone before these changes?
[10:21:41] waitimdesyncd: Yeah 50% of the playerbase is under rival and Spriests dont do well unless youre a top-end player statistically
[10:21:44] wyldeshock: imagine if you guys never picked up rogue
[10:22:02] sunileif: fuck rogues
[10:22:06] stockbridge10: gl
[10:22:10] wowsuomi: I meant in shuffle
[10:22:14] waitimdesyncd: flip rouges
[10:22:29] dankgamer97: f the rogues Madge
[10:22:32] sunileif: thats like 5 years of hate
[10:22:36] xDroozyy: did you guys win as boomy rogue?
[10:22:40] honsou2: when has DK won a tournament
[10:22:45] wowsuomi: Is it the same guy everytimee since tho
[10:22:46] figurines: Rogues are 0% fun to face. also 0% fun to have on your team in shuffle. It's just a micro managing DR fest and hope they kill in a duel out of your LoS. ZzZz
[10:22:53] SacsTvT: mate, what you think about bm when these changes come? Am I crazy for thinking that they might be decent in shuffle?
[10:22:59] waitimdesyncd: its not too late to make whaazz play HoN instead of WoW
[10:23:29] wowsuomi: Hnn?
[10:23:34] xDroozyy: sub destro gonna be nuts as well
[10:23:37] wowsuomi: Hon'
[10:23:39] dankgamer97: Just came back to the game, and had fun on my dk Sadge hope they wont unplayable
[10:23:53] waitimdesyncd: 2017? so if DK meta is every 10 years then we are only 3 years away ;D
[10:24:00] SacsTvT: why not tho? High sustain is a good match for the higher stam. BM will have is easier killing plates. More caster usually is decent for bm too? The net effect of the armor is what 5%-units? Not too much for it?
[10:24:00] figurines: demo/affy/healer gonna be free wins
[10:24:32] xoHOLLOW: hunter?
[10:24:47] krome2dadome: go enhance and put on a 2nd wep maybe
[10:24:49] crazycorgis: take off a piece?
[10:24:50] krome2dadome: instead of a shield
[10:24:54] krome2dadome: @notmes
[10:25:07] xDroozyy: rogue maybe?
[10:25:58] amnetv: 8% more physical
[10:26:12] honsou2: uhh didnt you have the same "DR againt current target" on DK? despite higher armor? 39 on both?
[10:26:42] Verissaugh: Question is, classes have added armor on the class tree. So I assumed they are nerfing the baseline before anything added
[10:27:22] amnetv: also, mes, don`t forget blizz nerfs armor every beginning of the season, so it will be brutal for season 4
[10:27:54] enviscerate: yes
[10:27:59] figurines: stamina changes offset the armor changes. Especially since so few classes are purely physical. Only worry is the warlock changes imo. Maybe ret
[10:28:02] waitimdesyncd: wouldnt surprise me if armor changes randomly in arena or depending on how much armor your target has and not ilvl xD
[10:28:31] krome2dadome: bed time. pray for me guys. gonna have nightmares of raid boss demo locks and wake of ashes
[10:29:18] Solushun: Gnite Krome Bedge
[10:29:30] Solushun: u ditching the alts? @notmes
[10:29:38] Solushun: I thought MesHunt said something 👀
[10:29:51] figurines: these are mid tier changes. you literally never see any good outlaw below 2100
[10:30:04] eMBeaR64oz: ret demo monkaS
[10:30:08] Solushun: Sadge
[10:30:10] Solushun: i was rooting for beastmaster
[10:30:21] sunileif: damn krome your nightmares are tame
[10:30:23] figurines: You see Sub and Assa fairly often
[10:30:52] honsou2: assa is everywhere on low mmr when its good
[10:31:12] dankgamer97: i wonder if meta will change ? assa affli might be more scary in 3's ApuApustaja
[10:31:12] Moobot: Tshirts, hoodies, and mugs available now! https://merch.streamelements.com/notmes
[10:31:31] sunileif: delete rogues from game
[10:32:02] waitimdesyncd: rogues are fine
[10:32:05] Verissaugh: I were more pointing towards talents will either make classes like warlocks more tanky due to them having % extra armor on the spec tree and some plates will get more or less nerfed based on how much %armor they have on the spec tree
[10:32:49] figurines: I just want rogue to be a reasonable kill target. thats all i ask
[10:33:50] honsou2: I was so happy when rogues lost all the shadowlands stuff that let them restealth with 8 dots on, thought they would finally be dying LUL Jokes on me
[10:34:00] figurines: master assasin.
[10:34:02] enviscerate: venom rush or vicious venoms
[10:34:27] figurines: blindside?
[10:34:53] figurines: hmm. I dropped kingsbane on mine. but I got my 1800 and just stopped on my rogue so i'm not too serious
[10:35:03] enviscerate: carnage drops bonespike
[10:35:52] enviscerate: you want sanguine blades too instead of vicious venoms or venom rush
[10:36:10] figurines: no sanguine blades?

[11:01:33] alltimer1986: @notmes I think they killed double plate comps lol especially dk …… DHwill rain supreme so hard
[11:02:01] figurines: DH damage isn't increased into plate...since only like 5% of their damage is physical
[11:02:03] eMBeaR64oz: win or lose its bed time for real now, didnt expect it take this long lol
[11:04:04] gelatokush: i was hopping they didnt take the approach of buffing stam and nerfing armor acroos the boaard instead of adjusting particular spec tankiness individually
[11:04:38] Chillinar: why are in first person
[11:05:01] Chillinar: Madge

[11:17:32] Drunkenb33r: yooo
[11:21:34] DjRio: have you had thorne supplements
[11:22:13] DjRio: i think ret changes are to counter rogues
[11:22:20] DjRio: i think they wanna see more melee/caster
[11:22:27] gelatokush: u can feel armor on hunters
[11:22:31] DjRio: so they made caster tankier
[11:23:43] DjRio: well yeah rogue/caster, im trying to say warrior/caster
[11:23:55] gelatokush: kinda cool that casters will have more armor then plate class
[11:23:56] DjRio: 30%
[11:24:02] gelatokush: makes sense
[11:24:06] DjRio: 20%i mean
[11:24:59] gelatokush: plate class are just gonna ddie easier to physical dmg like rogue,hunters,ww
[11:26:11] goatskull123: tbh i'm more pissed that they're reducing yet another rpg element for teh sake of "balance"
[11:26:40] DjRio: whats the point of being a plate lol
[11:26:47] DjRio: might as well remove armor
[11:26:49] xXTha618GodXx: biggest winners and biggest losers this balancing?
[11:26:51] DjRio: for everyone
[11:26:52] ACIDcuz: DK into evoker mage is already almost isntant death
[11:27:06] Solushun: everyone should get naked i agree @DjRio
[11:27:08] waitimdesyncd: DK play no sudden doom and no doom burst and play blood forged D:
[11:27:12] nikthevoker: sup
[11:29:37] gelatokush: im trying to think why they would go with armor changes and I cant find a reason my brain is hurting
[11:29:46] easybola: VoHiYo
[11:30:10] brojosefat: normalized armor ratings for all classes has never sounded better. Whats the point of having it when the heaviest class takes the most damages
[11:30:12] TiltTeamGG: 2020Snacking
[11:30:18] waitimdesyncd: to buff mages without having the uproar Kappa
[11:30:54] gelatokush: from a awc point of view seems like rmd/rmp got even better
[11:30:54] xXTha618GodXx: what will you be playing in the tourney?
[11:31:08] tench000: Maybe it has to do with class representation
[11:32:13] gelatokush: dk was the best melee in ss at high rating along with dh tho
[11:32:13] Moobot: Join my Discord community! https://discord.gg/mes
[11:32:38] goatskull123: bro frost is gona be even worse
[11:32:47] gelatokush: arms are already mid now they gonan be super mid
[11:33:01] Zumaji: i wonder if its going to make monks just squishy AF
[11:33:18] TheAshkandi: looking forward to that ret buff
[11:33:33] gelatokush: ret buffs are dumb sry
[11:33:55] gelatokush: more dmg ok watever
[11:34:13] goatskull123: rets are pretty good in pve
[11:34:25] gelatokush: arent rets like mid in raid
[11:34:54] anacronz: @notmes how warrior is gonna be at patch?
[11:34:56] goatskull123: there's not much difference between top and bot rets in dps since their rotation is pretty simple
[11:35:31] gelatokush: right
[11:35:34] saiyan333: its not only the changes, its the only spec that went thru in PvP
[11:35:38] loverboylloyd: lol
[11:35:43] gelatokush: well i gues its betetr in pve cuz not nerf but yea
[11:36:01] dankgamer97: yea these changes are soo random
[11:36:06] tench000: Blizz dev is a warlock, hahaha
[11:36:10] waitimdesyncd: good thing dhs didnt get nerfed
[11:36:23] gelatokush: arms ST is so bad
[11:36:26] despised1: Rogue needs some nerfs  in all 3 specs. 1 change to eviscerate is not gonna do it.  They are wayyyy too op
[11:36:30] nikthevoker: gonna try dk LFR for leggo LUL
[11:36:34] anacronz: So I don't play my main warrior
[11:37:13] dankgamer97: almost like they had a couple ideas and put them on a wheel and spun it, and just went with what it landed on
[11:37:50] alireza00700: why they nerf plate armor we already dying to these  casters @notmes
[11:38:02] gelatokush: one thing is for sure is there is no pvp dev that likes frost dk, think tha tspec been down bad for 10 yrs
[11:38:21] goatskull123: yeah I also thought that it was pretty balanced
[11:38:23] goatskull123: so far
[11:38:30] goatskull123: only outlier was rdruid I think
[11:38:34] yourKnightmaare: plate is gonna die to caster and melee. it's gonna feelgoodman
[11:39:04] ThePdfreak: well imo you do these changes so people keep playing and there is something new to experience
[11:39:08] waitimdesyncd: HHWHYY
[11:39:10] xXTha618GodXx: y don’t they change ret by 5% and not 20%-30%
[11:39:19] gelatokush: its just gonna kill pvp even more  if i think AABOUT IT MOST PLAYED CLASS ARE PLATE CLASS IM SURE SOME WILL QUIT
[11:39:22] gelatokush: caps
[11:39:26] DjRio: they favor rogue lol
[11:39:38] goatskull123: maybe ppl were complaining that its a melee meta
[11:39:40] yourKnightmaare: @gelatokush yeah they hate fdk in pvp
[11:39:54] ThePdfreak: do wl have the most armor in the game?
[11:39:55] yourKnightmaare: #bringbackheartstop
[11:39:58] JustTaki: is the demon blood makes sense Kappa
[11:40:01] ThePdfreak: or do holies with a shield have more
[11:40:14] alireza00700: idk who is doing these changes his so bad @notmes
[11:40:23] dankgamer97: Gonna have to lvl my lock Madge
[11:40:38] nikthevoker: the leggo is from last boss right
[11:40:41] TheAshkandi: do you think due to the plate armor decrease they didnt want to buff a war too much, because they are pure physical damage, so a war vs a dk theyd be doing tons of extra damage plus they still have mortal strike?
[11:40:44] gelatokush: why did they nerf shaman armor by 12.5 % i guess shamans were immortal lol
[11:41:03] yourKnightmaare: they said "here's a legendary for you guys" "sike nerds, fuck your armor"
[11:41:20] waitimdesyncd: shamans get 14% armor nerf too weirdly
[11:41:34] waitimdesyncd: ohh cuz resto sham shield i get it now
[11:41:34] gelatokush: they have a shield tho
[11:42:18] bigwillystylez55: I’m the lock Karrob
[11:42:36] Zumaji: I don't understand who even complained about armor values in the first place
[11:42:40] brojosefat: rogue and dh going to be staying on top I guess. they’re going to just pop plate
[11:42:42] Zumaji: it seemed out of left field
[11:42:43] waitimdesyncd: dj mes
[11:43:11] alireza00700: idk why they dont ask every pro players your spec need what and [what  class laking]comminucate with them even i know what to do to balance classes and these guys dont know it crazy @notmes
[11:43:21] waitimdesyncd: surely
[11:43:21] dankgamer97: Kappa
[11:43:23] enviscerate: Kappa
[11:43:30] gelatokush: was gonan gear my dk next but changed my mind its gonna be my mage next :D

[11:43:48] xXTha618GodXx: sounds like @djrio playlist
[11:44:06] waitimdesyncd: idk im excited to see the results on reset :D
[11:44:18] stoop_kid69: do you think the armor changes will make this a caster meta now?
[11:45:06] waitimdesyncd: sounds good to me
[11:45:15] waitimdesyncd: fuck it lets make it happen
[11:45:52] waitimdesyncd: so what youre saying is we can crowdsource a good forum post to pull strings on some DK buffs?
[11:45:59] gelatokush: they feel fine
[11:46:37] alireza00700: y but you can hear pro player;s opinion and then decide what part of they words are correct and do it in class tuning not all of words pro player suggest @notmes
[11:46:39] TheAshkandi: the armor thing barely effects ret damage to casters which is nice
[11:46:39] waitimdesyncd: shortening it?
[11:47:15] waitimdesyncd: rogues are fine
[11:47:33] Stormzfyre: they said the same thing about hte gouge change back in the day
[11:47:41] Zumaji: Maybe im biased, but shadowy duel has to be one of the more op talents ive seen in quite awhile. It needs to be removed imo
[11:48:32] nikthevoker: aww noone got leggo
[11:48:35] gelatokush: the armor changes just improves wats already good like  mage lock def not dying to wars and ww now  and rogues just gonna murder even more tanky class literally just accentuate the meta
[11:49:21] alireza00700: i mean mes you know it what expantion rouge or mages was so bad? tell one they dont know what they are doing @notmes
[11:49:43] Zumaji: As a warlock player, I still agree demo lock is going to be stupid. This armor change doesn't seem thought out at all
[11:49:52] dankgamer97: yea and sac shield gonna be huge
[11:50:41] gelatokush: maybe its not too late to cancel the armor changes QQ
[11:51:42] alireza00700: man this dev team just laughing at us yeah warriors go catch warlocks now :D  @notmes
[11:52:15] gelatokush: if the community was super vocal about it we could see some reverts, it did happen in the past
[11:52:15] Moobot: Tshirts, hoodies, and mugs available now! https://merch.streamelements.com/notmes
[11:52:23] melbu2423: G'morning mes and chat :)
[11:52:25] Zumaji: and demo has passively more armor than that lol
[11:52:28] shugguls: demo outlaw meta at AWC again
[11:52:42] blueelementxi: this is called FOTMflight instead of dragonflight
[11:52:43] nikthevoker: i just tanked LFR LUL not actual tank
[11:52:52] blueelementxi: gonna see a lot of warlocks
[11:52:59] blueelementxi: fear is now a stun LMAO
[11:53:01] Zumaji: yeah
[11:53:04] Zumaji: pasisve
[11:53:06] nikthevoker: ya
[11:53:13] Zumaji: specific to demo
[11:53:30] shugguls: demo armour plus soul link
[11:53:52] gelatokush: destro is gonan be even more s+
[11:54:01] healmeshammy: ret/demo new meta
[11:54:26] Zumaji: demo armour is a passive 90% and then soul link shares 10% of all damage with pet
[11:54:37] dankgamer97: KEKW
[11:54:38] Zumaji: there will be no point not to play demo, you'll bne nerfing yourself
[11:54:48] dankgamer97: New awc strat ? Pog
[11:54:53] blueelementxi: maybe but i think sub rogue is gonna be bad on tuesday
[11:55:11] Zumaji: oh and then fel armour on top of that is another 3% reduction
[11:55:19] gelatokush: sub destro  betetr then sub demo but yea
[11:55:36] ArtofAzeroth: Morning, Mes
[11:55:38] blueelementxi: @tench000 which is why the expansions before were better
[11:55:46] Zumaji: I actually think demo, bm hunter might be hilariously fun to play
[11:56:07] ZallKlos: just wondering, when you play ebon fever in arena, do you try to keep dots on all enemies?
[11:56:19] gelatokush: demo doesnt feel taht much more tanky when u play it tho
[11:56:20] yourKnightmaare: dh/rogue will be the only melee classes having fun.
[11:56:47] Zumaji: ehh i disagree
[11:56:50] blueelementxi: @yourKnightmaare ret too right? since they got a 20% dmg buff and do holystrike damage (physical)
[11:57:09] Zumaji: demo feels definitely more tank than destro/aff as it is now
[11:57:48] yourKnightmaare: @blueelementxi that's fair. but still their armor is nerfed since plate. so might be a glass cannon
[11:57:50] gelatokush: i feel ike the fact that destro can kick and can 2x coil helps alot they also have 5% more stam
[11:58:19] gelatokush: i played alot of demo and alot of destro and i dont die on one spec more then the othjer in 3s
[11:58:29] gelatokush: in 2s demo better
[11:59:18] aedd__: As a RSham main, I’m looking forward to having less armour %. Train the blue is going to feel even more relevant.

[11:59:44] JustTaki: you think maybe acquiring lego makes up for nerfs
[11:59:50] healmeshammy: and where is rogues
[11:59:59] Moobot: Please be sure to ask permission before posting links in chat! (@tench000)
[12:00:05] TheAshkandi: ret will be more squishy but the damage wont bechanged much vs casters holy strike is 50% physical, and rets autos are replaced by holystrike damage with crusading strikes talent
