[4:52:39] iigoronparasjee: drink beer KKona
[4:52:39] Zuphino: how much is stadium hotdogs?
[4:53:18] armin_tamzarian: the average NFL game has 18 minutes of actual football, the other 3 hours is just commercials and talking heads
[4:53:30] Niksen_99: In eu football its just 1x 15 min break in 90 min
[4:54:00] rogueclassic: @Niksen_99 no clue how people maange to watch american sports with all the commercial
[4:54:02] bacconader: @niksen_99 except for the 20 breaks caused by players flopping
[4:54:23] iigoronparasjee: soccer KKona
[4:54:44] Niksen_99: That gets added on extra time :) @bacconader
[4:54:46] MrNoldus: @bacconader well, Rather have Flopping than Commercials 3Head
[4:55:12] bacconader: i know I know, I’m just mememing

[4:55:18] Zuphino: the extra time is dependant on how much time was used on freekicks / freethrows etc
[4:55:20] Uki88: its a secret Kappa
[4:55:21] brooch_fan: I only have 20 boxes and well into my 2nd account after the delete cap
[4:55:25] Zuphino: its like "down time"
[4:55:34] bacconader: They roll a dice
[4:55:39] Zuphino: kinda +-
[4:55:40] iigoronparasjee: yep
[4:55:42] updobe: injury time too
[4:55:43] Niksen_99: Lets be clear there is NFL and then there is Football KEKW not soccer
[4:55:44] kelsper: it's not precise at all
[4:55:54] MrNoldus: like 50-60% of the time gets added
[4:55:56] Zuphino: nah its like 50% of the downtime
[4:56:06] bacconader: It’s soccer in then chat brother KKona @niksen_99
[4:56:06] armin_tamzarian: depends on which team paid the refs more
[4:56:06] Narex0: its about refs feeling
[4:56:08] Zuphino: reff
[4:56:11] iigoronparasjee: you end the game when its a good situation to end it
[4:56:19] kelsper: there's a timer on the side so they at least know how many minutes it's over 90
[4:56:19] Osskar65: reff
[4:56:19] iigoronparasjee: if theres soemthing happening you just let it play out
[4:56:29] Zuphino: it can even go beyond the "extra time" you dont end in the middle of an attack
[4:57:01] Zuphino: oh yea every time
[4:57:24] iceglow_: thing is the clock in soccer is ticking even if nothing happens, thats why they give extra time
[4:57:39] iigoronparasjee: YEP Clock
[4:57:42] Niksen_99: It sucks now with VAR because most goals now gets video checked for foul before actually giving the goal. So u cant really celebrate once your team scores
[4:57:44] IRiblenI: it depends on how much of a diva the main referee is
[4:57:56] lebishhh: @SalvDali we will fall out
[4:58:20] Biggie6242: so why do we count innings up
[4:58:24] Tronkxlol: Kinda hard to tell, but its not really precise but as people said depends on the time that was wasted on fouls, freekicks and stuff. when the game really ends kinda depends if there could possible nothing hapening in the timeframe that is set. So for example if you have 5 minutes overtime and there is a attack at 4:45 into that overtime they just wait until that attack is done and end the game afterwards even if it would take until like 5:45 or something and obv. the other way around as well
[4:58:27] Biggie6242: why don’t we start at 9 and go down to 1
[4:58:53] Tronkxlol: thats why we like racing sports xD
[4:58:55] rogueclassic: it's 2 halfs of 45min each half
[4:59:08] rogueclassic: with extra time added at the end of each half
[4:59:13] Zuphino: 200 laps monkaW

[4:59:24] bacconader: no ties, hate ties KKona
[4:59:32] Niksen_99: Formula 1 is so cool
[4:59:48] lonz_xoxo: The amount of extra time is set at the end of each half. It isn’t random LUL
[4:59:51] Biggie6242: football has ties
[4:59:55] Biggie6242: stop lying
[5:00:13] Cameron9551: they end the soccer match when all of the crowd has finally fallen asleep. KEKW

[5:02:15] lebishhh: extra time is the same thing as over time
[5:02:22] IRiblenI: what is the record on that tie?
[5:02:22] lebishhh: just different words
[5:02:43] Niksen_99: Its not the same in football
[5:02:56] lebishhh: yeah they add it on if people stopping the play of the game due to injury or substitutions
[5:03:12] lebishhh: so then they play like actually play 90 mins
[5:03:17] tomlogon: it because the clock never stops in soccer, so if you have injures or other time waste ref calls for an extra minutes to refund time
[5:03:21] Niksen_99: Spam click your hearthstone on him
