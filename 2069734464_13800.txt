[5:16:09] thehmmmm: even when sneaky picks a mage character he still autoattacks ICANT
[5:16:15] Hawqe: @phoenixdream64, OMEGALAUGHING
[5:16:15] WarmVoice: @WarmVoice Mage Background Story: The art of wielding the arcane has been passed down for generations from master to apprentice for ages in the city of Welryn, a place ruled by mages known as the Elders.
[5:16:19] KoojTxib: LETSFUCKINGSHIT
[5:16:22] meowdge: thats his poop lookUp
[5:16:27] phoenixdream64: @Hawqe what xff
[5:16:29] lo_name: @cashchopswpn yea they had an idea to bend d3 and poe so... that's about it I guess
[5:16:36] WarmVoice: @WarmVoice The Mage was born into this station like the Elders before him and trained in the arcane arts as they were, harsh and uncompromising. The Mage let himself be sculpted and shaped until he too could sculpt with the wild energies of the arcane that suffused through existence.
[5:16:45] Hawqe: the circle at her wake OMEGALAUGHING
[5:16:46] shakingfromstarvation: this game is better than Diablo
[5:16:50] kether0: HI
[5:16:54] weisxs: HI
[5:17:02] Rismoury: HI
[5:17:14] WarmVoice: @juupanu He once thought himself kind, more compassionate than his peers. He spared his young apprentice the severity and coldness he was subjected to, yet he learned his kindness was a weakness in truth. The Elders exiled his apprentice for her defiance. The Mage's his skill in magic the only thing sparing him from being exiled himself.
[5:17:14] juupanu: @WarmVoice No no, not the mage backstory. I'm talking about the strimmers personal RP history he's created for his character to immerse us chatters in his "great" gameplay.
[5:17:16] Daboom148: Yo Sneaky you fighting for democracy tonight?
[5:17:24] WarmVoice: @juupanu Oh, lol
[5:17:56] juupanu: @WarmVoice Knowing this strimmer though it's probably something giga perverted or at least penisi.
[5:18:57] meowdge: Uhmm indubitably
[5:19:04] juupanu: Chat! Wake up! Surely this isn't going to be another infamous Lost Arklike game that has everyone in perma ResidentSleeper  mode.
