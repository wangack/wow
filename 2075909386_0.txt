[0:16:14] nikthevoker: new lleggos?!
[0:16:22] Anhak: they said ZG will be more comparible to like BWL rather then catch up
[0:16:31] Anhak: but thats the only example they gave
[0:16:42] krome2dadome: i got banned for 2 weeks :)
[0:16:45] Old_Tomatoes: Would they keep the whole each raid is worth doing for the rest of the game style of vanilla?

[0:21:12] Anhak: We currently plan to revamp many items from dungeons and raids (including the existing 20 player raids) at level 60, as well as adding new items across all phases of endgame. We have a ton of exciting playstyles that are new or were traditionally seen as “off specs” that have been given life in Season of Discovery and will come into their full power at 60. We want to itemize well for as many different builds and playstyles as we are able to in the time we have.

[0:23:21] Old_Tomatoes: Vendorstrike?
[0:23:52] Anhak: yea i mean one trash item that is now insanely viable is the rogue bwl trinket
[0:24:07] Anhak: that trinket in era/classic is vendor trash now its possibly just BIS
[0:24:07] Moobot: Tshirts, hoodies, and mugs available now! https://merch.streamelements.com/notmes
[0:24:51] Old_Tomatoes: They would need to slap a ton of defensive stats on gear to make pvp not be even worse than it is
[0:24:52] Anhak: We currently also have plans to make adjustments to the difficulty of all raids, as well as the power level of rewards available. This does not mean making raids harder or easier across the board relative to player power, but looking individually at each experience and defining what those experiences are about and what their purpose is.
[0:25:04] Anhak: Theoretical Example: A raid that may have traditionally been considered to be “catchup” raid such as Zul’Gurub could see adjustments that bring their challenge level up slightly, but also greatly increase the quality and diversity of the rewards so that they feel like a viable progression path alongside other current content in that phase, such as Blackwing Lair.

[0:25:58] Colaja953: crabRave
[0:26:13] Anhak: zg based on that statement will be harder then mc or atleast have better loot then mc and aq20 better then bwl
[0:26:37] Anhak: 20 man IS VERY GOOD CHANGE going from 10 man to 40 was gonna suck
[0:26:52] Anhak: with 20 man u can now just have 2 guild/teams merge rather then 4
[0:27:04] Old_Tomatoes: I think classes that are not wanted as much will have it harder this go around
[0:27:13] Anhak: they still could make aq and naxx 40

[0:29:36] Anhak: rogue now rogue has no raid spot unless it does really insane damage
[0:29:43] Old_Tomatoes: I just noticed with 10 mans how overpopulation of some classes are flooding lfg
[0:29:55] Old_Tomatoes: and 20 is half of 40
[0:30:12] Anhak: rogue doesnt bring any raid buff or debuff or any desire to want a rogue over any other class unless it does damage.
[0:30:19] Old_Tomatoes: the % of healers to tanks becomes more unfavorable I think
[0:30:46] nikthevoker: raptor strike spam
[0:30:59] nikthevoker: i do the same thing, they had no heath too
[0:31:10] Anhak: SP hunter is apparently not better then melee or range but its like viable like ppl are parsing 99s and such

[1:23:08] avenueone: yeah mes REMEMBER
[1:23:20] eMBeaR64oz: level it again but in sod at 100% xp rate at march 5th
[1:23:29] artsskeit: krolblade
[1:23:32] avenueone: warr leveling aint bad in sod
[1:23:39] avenueone: victory rush from the start

[1:24:01] sunileif: !liam
[1:24:02] StreamElements: i always tell my lfg teammates in 1392 to farm conduits so we can climb but then they leave the group (see !liam2)
[1:24:03] eMBeaR64oz: i might level a priest when the xp buff kicks in if you plan on leveling another toon mes
[1:24:28] al_capow: imo they should put 100% xp bonus behind already having 1 level 40
[1:24:36] Anhak: also makes more alt friendly
[1:25:00] avenueone: yeah retail ppl wont wanna level with no bonus xp
[1:25:00] Moobot: Join my Discord community! https://discord.gg/mes
[1:25:04] eMBeaR64oz: the druid buffs felt so insane, lifebloom actually god tier, and boomy moonfire sunfire tick HARD
[1:25:28] al_capow: I think we're going to see mythic-esque raids at 60 in terms of mechanics
[1:25:34] Szain3: DinoDance
[1:25:40] SARGO69: wait what xp buff are you talking about? isn't there an xp buff leveling from 1-25 already?
[1:25:45] Anhak: @al_capow 0%
[1:25:49] al_capow: I think they'll make some super hard 10 man ones
[1:25:57] Anhak: they litterally said they want raids to be accessable
[1:25:58] Idgtst: it feels like classic being easy is one of the biggest appeals
[1:26:34] artsskeit: but only if you're a warrior or rogue
[1:26:35] Idgtst: they do still feel relatively simple, it honestly kind of reminds me on mop
[1:26:40] eMBeaR64oz: the boomy runes have been fine, the slots made it really fun hybrid for casting
[1:26:44] Anhak: poison rogue being able to play (mutilate might be too far TBH)
[1:27:21] Anhak: were getting wrist and helm its just do we get another set of slots after/before that
[1:27:38] Idgtst: some of the potential datamined runes for next phase seem to not be as game changing as earlier phases
[1:28:00] al_capow: I wonder if they'd ever consider having gear drop with rng on rune slots
[1:28:05] al_capow: like socket rolls
[1:29:46] artsskeit: no titanforging/rng stuff pls

[2:30:19] Anhak: @atoker the problem with look at anything like that is balancing could come in say no never or just nerf stuff to the ground. honestly the one thing in that tree that worrys me for both pve and pvp is Tricks lasting 1 hour which pve im sure you can see how removing threat completely with snapping and such could be strong. but if left unchecked justa 15% damage buff with pvp talents is nutty

[3:11:26] chipncheese: realistically how do we nerf DH"s, I saw we get rid of CC immunity when  using vengeful retreat
[3:12:14] DSay987: mes my pet spells are not showing do u know why
[3:12:23] DSay987: on my dk
[3:14:15] exizt_01: disable your addons til you find whats blocking it
[3:14:19] chipncheese: starting with that would go a long way into stopping them from never being cc'd and would hurt their gap closers
[3:14:47] chipncheese: maybe change so everything isn't chaos dmg so mastery doesnt amplify everything that they do by X percent
[3:15:44] chipncheese: ROFL
[3:15:45] chipncheese: cya
[3:16:10] chubmax: hmmm
[3:16:17] chubmax: is aff flying under the radar atm?
[3:16:26] chipncheese: LUL no
[3:16:26] chubmax: I feel like with slight buffs it would be amazing
[3:16:39] chipncheese: one school of magic
[3:16:42] chipncheese: easily shut down
[3:16:48] chubmax: yeah that’s rough

[3:16:56] chubmax: idk I flew to 1900 with it
[3:16:59] chipncheese: look what DH just did
[3:17:01] chipncheese: with a 45 second cd
[3:17:07] chubmax: I mean neither does demo
[3:17:20] chubmax: yeah I know I got legend tonight with a DH it’s busted af
[3:17:26] chipncheese: ya but demo can do stuff outside of being kicked
[3:17:37] chipncheese: even when they are kkicked htey cna still interrupt, cc, etc
[3:17:42] chipncheese: aff just dead stick
[3:17:47] chipncheese: takes full dmg for teh duration of the lockout
[3:17:56] chipncheese: can't use wall, interrupt, cc's etc
[3:17:58] chubmax: yeah but they so easily can get precog
[3:18:02] chubmax: with channels
[3:18:21] chubmax: idk man I flew to 1900 with like a 70% wr
[3:18:26] chipncheese: i dont see why a good playe would kick into drain soul
[3:18:29] chubmax: just trying it out
[3:18:41] chubmax: drain soul is partially the money maker
[3:19:01] chipncheese: but it isntt he pressure, if they really wanna stop it, use a stun
[3:19:03] chipncheese: or a cc
[3:19:07] chipncheese: no reason to kick nito it
[3:19:12] chipncheese: when you have 800 other ways of interrupting it
[3:19:23] chubmax: look at wownarena logs for tier list 2100+
[3:19:28] chubmax: aff is right behind DH

[3:20:45] chubmax: dmg is so low
[3:21:07] chipncheese: it also has full time MS up on target

[3:24:27] chubmax: yeah
[3:25:22] chipncheese: with uhalf the matches
[3:25:24] chipncheese: and 1/4 the matches of destro
[3:25:40] Szain3: DinoDance
[3:26:19] chipncheese: and a much lower first blood percentage
[3:26:32] chubmax: aff?
[3:26:44] Drathimos: its because of the chaotic imprint pvp talent
[3:26:48] Drathimos: gives it insane scaling
[3:27:13] chubmax: aff first blood is low I think
[3:27:20] chipncheese: yes aff, literaly looking at 2100+ fo what you were saying
[3:27:43] chipncheese: it has low representation too, half the games of demo and 1/4 of destro at 2100+

[3:29:20] Drathimos: yea thats the suggestion i told ya last night
[3:29:20] Moobot: Join my Discord community! https://discord.gg/mes
[3:29:34] Drathimos: pve doesnt account for the pvp tier nerf so it could change the priority
[3:29:46] chubmax: pretty sure blade dance tossed a glaive even when throw is on cd mes
[3:29:52] chubmax: @notmes
[3:30:36] chubmax: bc one expired
[3:30:39] chubmax: it only ticks 3x
[3:30:39] Drathimos: hmm weird
[3:30:46] Drathimos: shouldnt it work like ignite
[3:30:55] atoker: so you have to throw glaive after blade dance for soul scar damage?
[3:31:47] Drathimos: spaghet code
[3:31:52] chubmax: aff doesn’t feel bad into anything tho I’ve noticed
[3:31:53] Foe009: hey Mes, what are you using for these nameplate debuffs?
[3:32:00] chipncheese: @chubmax people just dont see it often because its not as good as the 2 other specs, they may think they are unkillable kind of like they were in slands season 2-3

[3:32:36] Drathimos: does pvp dummy account for the pvp tier nerf? cuz the tooltip on tier doesnt change like it does in arena
[3:32:41] chubmax: but yeah
[3:32:46] chubmax: I don’t think aff has bad matchups
[3:33:02] Drathimos: i meant the tooltip when you hover over tier gear
[3:33:15] Drathimos: i duno if its just a visual bug tho
[3:33:22] Drathimos: it could be scuffed pvp dummy things
[3:33:57] Drathimos: usually the tier gear tooltip reflects the 50% nerf when you touch pvp dummy but the dh one doesnt
[3:34:21] ImHomegr0wn: there's a "nice" issue that mvq was trying to get fixed with chaotic imprint a while ago which is probably affecting this. whenever the glaive doesn't get modified by a magic school (chaotic imprint buff) then it does piss damage
[3:34:30] ImHomegr0wn: sometimes you don't get the chaotic imprint buff
[3:34:42] IAmBlue1337: Do you spam Throw Glaive atm?

[3:35:14] IAmBlue1337: Dont think that is good, only when chasing or stopping drink
[3:35:24] IAmBlue1337: The most important is to get the debuff from it which still comes from the set
[3:35:24] indithedog: in pve u prio chaos unless out of range
[3:35:32] thefallen1503: wanna help push my 2s to 2000? current 1900 rsham
[3:35:52] Drathimos: pve plays the immo build
[3:35:58] Drathimos: at least according to smolderon top dh logs
[3:36:08] ImHomegr0wn: glaive is really low prio in the rotation in the pve guides
[3:36:16] torzzttv: what mouse u using Mes? mmo or just a 4/5 button?
[3:36:17] Drathimos: but immo build is cause of crit scaling which is nerfed in pvp
[3:36:38] ImHomegr0wn: 17. Cast  Throw Glaive if you will overcap charges before your next  Blade Dance or  Death Sweep
[3:36:55] thefallen1503: how should i add you?
[3:37:10] likeapro1337: @Drathimos I do 150ish stable dps with normal build and like 130ish with immo build
[3:37:15] likeapro1337: maybe immo build is mainly for dispells?
[3:37:30] Drathimos: so theres two things to factor from pve to pvp. 1) the pvp tier nerf and 2) chaotic imprint
[3:38:14] johnnythunderbunny: can you carry me from 2500-2800 rq
[3:38:40] ImHomegr0wn: glaive not always doing a random school of magic is what hurts even though the tooltip says it's suppose to
[3:39:00] likeapro1337: On your big pop u don't have to throw glaive I think becasue u can reset blade dance
[3:39:12] ImHomegr0wn: mvq was clipping and showing his combat log to help it get fixed at the start of the season
[3:39:20] indithedog: its crazy how fast u get the hunt back
[3:39:25] likeapro1337: but on normal goes sometimes u will have an extra glaive stack but if u over do it u run out of stacks to sync with blade dance
[3:39:46] likeapro1337: @ImHomegr0wn oo really
[3:39:50] thefallen1503: @notmes how should i add you for 2s?
[3:40:01] johnnythunderbunny: just rq
[3:40:44] likeapro1337: see like here u ran out of throwglaive for blade dance on meta
[3:41:08] IAmBlue1337: When comparing you also have to compare the difference in soulscar dmg to the extra dmg you have from Chaos Strike / Annihilation. And also factoring in if you want rot dmg or direct dmg.
[3:41:10] ImHomegr0wn: any idea if they fixed the glimpse meld mechanic yet?
[3:41:17] IAmBlue1337: I dont see manually clicking Throw glaive being better in any way
[3:42:11] indithedog: dh dmg is so passive lol
[3:42:11] likeapro1337: @IAmBlue1337 ONLY sometimes u can minmax extra global

[3:42:56] IAmBlue1337: @likeapro1337 Yea if you are out of range and cant hit ofc its better to just get a throw glaive off
[3:42:56] likeapro1337: if u never throw glaive u will be fine to squeeze the juice u can minmax out of meta, extra charge will accumlate overtime
[3:43:01] rembrandt89: why is that doesnt it still refresh it though ?
[3:43:07] chipncheese: i dont play my DH to learn things, i play my dh to zug zug
[3:43:12] likeapro1337: @IAmBlue1337 i mean yeah ofc pvp is not always a script
