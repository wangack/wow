[0:14:52] Philbobaggins12: @Lionheartex yeah, but the 40 man clusterfuck is funny!
[0:15:06] Lionheartex: You'd think that guilds would plan for 40 man knowing we're going to have 40 mans at 60
[0:15:16] Miss_Kas: KEKW i was thinking the same
[0:15:18] Braggardt: For sure, but the alternative of turning all the 60 raids into 10 mans would have been controversial also

[0:17:33] PinkTaricFTW: The phrase is "beer and pretzels"
[0:17:33] OspreyRed: casual
[0:17:35] Medias: Never heard that one
[0:17:35] hiraikou: peepoFAT
[0:17:38] Braggardt: I read this as single boss raids like Onyxia remaining 40 man because they'd be easy to pug
[0:17:39] alwiro: the fuck does that even mean?
[0:17:47] Lionheartex: For me, Maccas and KFC 20-hour grinds NODDERS
[0:17:47] Vestina: Soda is for potato chips not pretzels
[0:17:49] gettincranky: Can we exchange the pretzels for mozzarella sticks?
[0:17:50] OspreyRed: yeah, light and casual
[0:17:52] aftergl0w: raids you can eat during
[0:18:07] ravenofjudgement: @aftergl0w but your keyboard and mouse will get greasy
[0:18:08] Tibbroar: mike ruining classic now too Smadge
[0:18:13] Ashidomus: yeah, every 20-man would be better
[0:18:14] beskarsilver: Yep
[0:18:15] MrZxorm: What about ZG/AQ20?
[0:18:16] Philbobaggins12: all 40 man Madge
[0:18:19] Lionheartex: I want SM40 though peepoRiot
[0:18:20] Hunter_GS: probably better for consistency and guild culture if everything is 20 man
[0:18:21] Braggardt: NODDERS that's my thought too, 20 seems fine, maybe 40 for Ony and world bosses
[0:18:23] Hunter_GS: even zg
[0:18:23] aftergl0w: @ravenofjudgement ah, but not with pretzels
[0:18:42] alwiro: are even enough  players around to go 40?
[0:18:50] nohomu67: hiii
[0:18:55] Hunter_GS: there are, but it still a pain in the ass to orginize it
[0:19:04] aftergl0w: eh
[0:19:07] rymed: Are they?
[0:19:08] Philbobaggins12: No, world buffs are garbage
[0:19:10] Ryuseki1: 20 man with the boys vs 40 man with 20 extra nobs...
[0:19:14] KelticNight: classic Andy's want classic
[0:19:15] Lionheartex: until you have to set alarms to log in and collect world buffs at 60 Despairge
[0:19:18] BoysAreVeryCute: its classic, arent people already taking it too seriously
[0:19:20] Lunarsear: Lunarsear subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 57 months! ALOO gamers how is the road trip going
[0:19:20] Hunter_GS: no its not man, its boring to always go and get buffs before every fucking raid night
[0:19:23] Umseslad: I thought it was already taken seriously
[0:19:23] neldorath_: 40mans are such a pain to organize and loot distribution is frustrating im not gonna miss them at all tbh
[0:19:24] brackers89: Smadge no fun only sweat
[0:19:31] Braggardt: World buffs are fun when there's a couple of them, but the expedition to get half a dozen in Era is excessive
[0:19:45] ravenofjudgement: classic andys NODDERS
[0:19:50] BoysAreVeryCute: no no you arent, they are, by being classic andies
[0:19:50] Lionheartex: World buffs were fine when we were working from home and could log in on demand for them, but now world is BAU, no dice
[0:19:52] aftergl0w: they want full classic but with runes
[0:19:53] KelticNight: it's SoD, not classic. it's supposed to be different
[0:19:57] Philbobaggins12: @Preachlfw do it again, 40 man raids lets goooo!
[0:19:57] Goregie: you have era for the classic experience
[0:19:57] rudezki: 40 man raid Despairge
[0:20:01] kaw_kaw: There are still era servers for the classic experience.
[0:20:02] Lithirrdys: 40 man raids sucked. they always did. anyone saying otherwise needs to take the rose tinted glasses off
[0:20:03] OspreyRed: classic Andys for sure
[0:20:06] alwiro: organizing 40s in sod is just gonna work in the first month. afterwards too many people will trickle away to get 40s
[0:20:15] Phabey: 'something happening I personally dislike' = 'devs missing the mark, game ruined'. Classic Andies
[0:20:30] Lionheartex: @Lithirrdys I raided hardcore classic 2019 and adored 40 mans. Unironically my favourite raiding experience
[0:20:32] urbish_: KEKW
[0:20:35] Pang_Tong: Taking it seriously is how wow is played

[0:20:56] alwiro: Nerdge buckle up noob, we're going hardcore
[0:20:58] OspreyRed: Classic Andys already have Classic era. SoD is its own thing
[0:20:58] dan_alexandre: WoW players... taking something seriously? surprise xD they've been trained by blizzard to min max everything

[0:21:45] Prevention6: just had a big bean burrito and im having some wild gas
[0:21:47] Lionheartex: MC was already like giga easy. 20 man for MC is better because of loot distribution on high value items.
[0:21:48] rymed: Remember this is a sample of forum posters, it's a very biased source
[0:21:52] KalmBeforeSomr: does forum users represent the majority

[0:43:54] Philbobaggins12: Cheer100 I thought hero talents were supposed to feel unique and powerful? You know, make you feel like a hero instead of what seems like passives.

[0:44:03] Cara1977: @lunarsear Hey Luna
[0:44:03] Orguz: ola Dreas :D

[0:44:46] Junglecack: bANAL talents maybe?
[0:44:49] Cara1977: @lunarsear I'm brilliant. I hope you're the same!
[0:44:49] DzikiWegorz1223: I'm not sure why they need  so many talents? so I can click why leveling up?
[0:44:51] DJDigiUK: HUHH
[0:45:00] Orguz: Mike, since its not mothersday, can we expect you there this weekend? Kappa
[0:45:04] Philbobaggins12: @Hunter_GS yeah, but calling them hero talents is a bit of a joke ngl
[0:45:14] nohomu67: @Cubick23 Shruge Play what you want instead of chasing meta
[0:45:18] ptolewastaken: what's the difference between volcanic damage and fire damage?

[0:45:44] Hunter_GS: its a name, what should they call em? "extra funny taly talents"
[0:45:45] ptolewastaken: @chavelo_ then why isn't it fire + nature D:
[0:45:46] ramneson: chainull Shruge
[0:45:47] Geri_0123: mostly for immune phases I guess
[0:45:48] KelticNight: rampingâ„¢
[0:45:49] EeraGames: @dzikiwegorz1223 basicslly so you feel rewarded each level, because otherwise you might quit. Is the cynical corpa theory
[0:45:50] ramneson: chainpull
[0:45:51] Philbobaggins12: @chavelo_ A name like that carries weight, especially in the warcraft universe though
[0:45:52] Corruptwarrior: builders now go burrrrr
[0:45:52] DaftiDuck_: isnt that just great tho
[0:45:57] Fleshtotem: @DaftiDuck_ yeah but they are just the filler spells

[0:50:10] Corruptwarrior: must have more brrr followed by honk-shoo
[0:50:11] AlbinoSchnitzl: There are so many conditions on every talent, it's insane
[0:50:13] MadAllDay_: I miss the steady dps
[0:50:17] rymed: I imagine it limits design space
[0:50:17] roadroller_dah: so you like rng loot but not rng damage
[0:50:20] Maddroxv: cause with consistent damage output they'd actually have to apoligize for bad tuning
[0:50:22] chavelo_: whats the CD of wake ?
[0:50:24] benhawkins: maybe they want the game to be less spreadsheet-y?
[0:50:28] smartm07: but with the CD on the abilities, you will almost always have that buff active
[0:50:40] rymed: If you have consistent burst, you can cheese some mechanics etc
[0:50:45] tirain67: wake is 30 secs CD
[0:50:48] majkos: Eternal Flame return
[0:50:50] KaiZen2048: ALOO Chat and Preach

[0:52:57] Allessii: with light of dawn
[0:52:58] tirain67: light of dawn had no cap
[0:52:58] Corruptwarrior: 'target'
[0:53:25] majkos: Shruge
[0:53:27] Allessii: We are race cars paladins now
[0:53:28] Ren26: feels like these talent trees will actually provide legit choice to players, whereas the current trees are almost always very restricted based on the content
[0:53:30] tirain67: it should
[0:53:31] nohomu67: @Corruptwarrior Target typically means people who are hit, not who you've clicked on
[0:53:32] ramneson: Shruge
[0:53:33] smartm07: Shruge
[0:53:39] Marach: AoE has not "target" so should go everywhere
[0:53:41] Corruptwarrior: yea, but i dunno if it would trigger sunspot
[0:53:44] chavelo_: @Ren26 there is no choice here, you get them all
[0:53:46] Corruptwarrior: @nohomu67 fair enough
[0:53:57] DaftiDuck_: haste is fun

[0:54:28] Syrjyys: @Faeynna All those Sun Spots on bench!
[0:54:31] tirain67: last talent is insane
[0:54:36] KelticNight: KEKW
[0:54:38] nohomu67: It'll definitely get nerfed if you can apply multiple with aoe monkaW
[0:54:45] alwiro: monkeh
[0:54:49] Lunarsear: lmao
[0:54:52] MadAllDay_: Nika
[0:54:53] Marach: wait that haste stacks?? we're looking at holy palas being able to get 40% haste!
[0:54:53] Mezegis_Yo: BLOONS! Pog

[0:55:28] Corruptwarrior: this is really close to a set from ESO
[0:55:29] majkos: @nohomu67 yeah, quite sure its on main target only, would be silly to aoe apply on entire pack, would look cool tho ;]
[0:55:31] benhawkins: so you just emit beams during wings, sounds awesome
[0:55:33] nivlac617: its giga glimmer of light
