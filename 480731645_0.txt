[5:36:36] MadisiLoL: @Exagtly i dont know how much it is i just know its not expensive. probably same as america? also kinda its just viewed as a big no no like a hard drug lol
[5:36:47] SiimplyVenom: pepeD
[5:36:55] MadisiLoL: @Exagtly to the point where celebrities who have been caught all make headlines nad have to publicly apologize and etc

[5:37:50] mikejcrawford: ^
[5:37:50] yewhan: MadisiLoL, ahh shiet, i knew it was a big nono culturally but didn't quite know it was that insane

[5:38:05] mikejcrawford: squadCozy PopCorn
[5:38:29] yewhan: anything psychoactive can bring light to an underlying mental health condition
[5:38:44] MadisiLoL: @Exagtly yea its just viewed more harshly cuz there isnt a public "light drug" or "hard drug" view so it just falls in "drug" category which is pretty much same as hrd drug
[5:38:50] iamBanda: I might have to get back into wow as well. played untill WotLK back in the day
[5:39:02] MadisiLoL: @Exagtly of course its low key popular and easy to get here
[5:39:31] yewhan: MadisiLoL, ahh okay, i'm assuming it's much more of a thing in the country as opposed to the cities since it's so densely populated?
[5:39:59] MadisiLoL: @Exagtly it'd be backwards, more popular in cities less so in country lol
[5:40:06] yewhan: MadisiLoL, oh dang
[5:40:16] Navarim: what server?
[5:40:20] brickzor89: @limitlessray Just be glad your not playing slotmachines, sounds like you got a addiction issue
[5:40:26] ceLtv: @limitlessray A Realm Reborn is a great game. You'd get addicted to wow lol
[5:40:28] MadisiLoL: @Exagtly like anywhere its easier to do and get away with sshady things in densely populated areas
[5:40:30] Navarim: ah nice
[5:40:37] Fusaki2: xqcT
[5:41:24] yewhan: MadisiLoL, fair enough, i would've expected the smell to be a dead giveaway and bc it's deemed as a nono culturally people would jump onto reporting it. glad to learn smth new tho
[5:41:25] aSanny: About 50s on Herod

[5:42:29] MadisiLoL: @Exagtly im sure they find a way to deal with smell easily lol and i would think people dont know the smell that often/well, i still have yet to see someone blazed here albeit i dont live in a big city nor countryside
[5:42:40] MadisiLoL: @Exagtly people would suspect you more if youre foreign of course lol
[5:42:49] yewhan: MadisiLoL, ahh yeah that makes sense LULW

[5:53:25] Swior: @bentholyptus first goal is to reach 60, then you want to get the best gear for every armor/weapon slot, the other goals include gathering reputations for various things, etc
[5:53:38] Grencia140: super cheap limitlessray like 3000 yen per person? but you need a group
[5:53:41] ceLtv: that's weird is mouse cursor shows inaccurate compared to where its at in game
