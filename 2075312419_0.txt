[0:15:02] draegon_tengoku_zgz: Oh sorry that's your  dishonorable kills in the Barrens
[0:15:40] Topher_IRL: That's like American Football
[0:15:47] Topher_IRL: 9 minutes of actual content
[0:15:48] Topher_IRL: LUL
[0:16:09] SavedEight_ZGZ: yeaaaaaah, im not the biggest fan of that. esp when its on netflix or hulu. like if this was live TV, okay. but i just binged the last 14 episodes, i dont need a recall lmao
[0:16:22] draegon_tengoku_zgz: I mean its American Football has more action than Hockey
[0:16:26] Lusciousdan: Honestly these shows are now edited for people who are on their phones doing something else with it on in the background
[0:16:32] AmandaMarie_ZGZ: @draegon_tengoku_zgz are you high?
[0:16:32] AmandaMarie_ZGZ: lol
[0:16:36] Tinit5190: This is the most laid back farming I have done though
[0:16:46] Topher_IRL: The clock is ticking while nothing happens
[0:16:47] Spyke_ZGZ: KEKW
[0:16:50] SavedEight_ZGZ: maybe rugby, def not football
[0:16:51] Topher_IRL: YAAAAAWWWWWN
[0:16:52] Topher_IRL: lol
[0:16:57] draegon_tengoku_zgz: American Football > Hockey
[0:16:58] Lusciousdan: I like my football but the game has like 5 minutes of actual plays
[0:17:06] Tinit5190: ya
[0:17:08] AmandaMarie_ZGZ: @draegon_tengoku_zgz no way lol

[0:17:30] Spyke_ZGZ: Football: Run 2 yards, fall, stand there for a minute again
[0:17:39] SavedEight_ZGZ: I think he means he enjoys american football more than hockey, cuz no way football has more action than hockey lol
[0:17:43] Spyke_ZGZ: Hockey: Get the shit checked out of you, get up, get the shit checked out of you again
[0:17:45] SavedEight_ZGZ: somebody literally got their neck sliced open this year
[0:17:52] Tinit5190: I'm stealing the skinning from bots lmao
[0:18:00] draegon_tengoku_zgz: Mind you I've been to a few amateur hockey games where the fights in the stands and on the ice was the highlight
[0:18:22] SavedEight_ZGZ: "amateur hockey"
[0:18:24] Lusciousdan: I mean the guy getting his throat cut with a skate was kind of just a freak thing, nothing to do with regular play
[0:18:36] SavedEight_ZGZ: @Lusciousdan he said more action, thats action imo
[0:18:36] Lusciousdan: It wasn't a Happy Gilmore situation
[0:18:42] Topher_IRL: Wings & Avs
[0:18:44] Spyke_ZGZ: It's amateur for a reason. And a lot of the time those guys are trying to make it, they're not looking to get hurt or play too hard.
[0:18:44] Topher_IRL: Never forget
[0:18:53] draegon_tengoku_zgz: @savedeight_zgz i mean its the Huntington Blizzard...you tell me what league it was
[0:18:57] aginsb: well beating the shit out of your opponent is just how you play rugby so no need for special fight rules
[0:19:06] SavedEight_ZGZ: @draegon_tengoku_zgz i dont care enough lol
[0:19:21] SavedEight_ZGZ: rugby players are somethin else
[0:19:22] Spyke_ZGZ: Australian Football has more action than American Football.
[0:19:33] Spyke_ZGZ: Shit is like football and rugby on a cocaine bender together.
[0:19:48] Spyke_ZGZ: Legit you get your arm broke, you get the fuck up, run off the field, and pick your replacement.
[0:19:56] Lusciousdan: Well of course it's nuts it's Australian, the ball is probably venomous
[0:20:01] Spyke_ZGZ: KEKW
[0:20:13] SavedEight_ZGZ: went to school with somebody who was 6'5" 325 lbs and played for a local rugby team. dude was kind of small compared to his teammates lolol, watched one game and i was like "yeah ill never play this"
[0:20:25] StreamElements: Looking for uber chads to game with? Check out the 'Looking for Group' channels in the Discord, https://discord.gg/Zeegers
[0:20:31] Spyke_ZGZ: A kicker from there came over here to play and said something like "Yeah I don't have to worry about getting my leg snapped as a kicker here"
[0:20:43] Lusciousdan: Rugby dudes actually having cardio is crazy to me, NFL it's just sprint for 5 seconds then try not to have your heart explode before the next play
[0:20:44] DrunkenHorror: mornin @Zeegers
[0:20:58] SavedEight_ZGZ: his name was Devin, devin was a big boi lol
[0:21:01] DrunkenHorror: good
[0:21:27] Spyke_ZGZ: @Lusciousdan The fact that this is just marginally verifiable thanks to what's-his-name from the Bills makes me uncomfortable lol
[0:21:51] Topher_IRL: Yeah could pitch it as a chest route but last night you said you didn't even think it was good for $$$
[0:21:52] Topher_IRL: So I dunnoi
[0:22:37] SavedEight_ZGZ: Wayne Shelford, If you know, you know..
[0:23:00] draegon_tengoku_zgz: Maybe if me and Mal come visit you can take me to a hockey game Zeegs
[0:23:12] Topher_IRL: @SavedEight_ZGZ Kenny Wayne Shelford?
[0:23:14] Topher_IRL: LUL
[0:23:20] Spyke_ZGZ: @SavedEight_ZGZ Isn't that the guy who had his... yeah... ripped off?
[0:23:28] Lusciousdan: Anyway I don't like watching folks get ackshewally injured, that's no fun
[0:23:44] Topher_IRL: @Lusciousdan What about if it's Claude Lemiuex
[0:23:45] Lusciousdan: CTE stuff makes it hard to watch NFL/UFC like I used to
[0:24:06] SavedEight_ZGZ: @Spyke_ZGZ yes! he also finished that game lmao
[0:24:15] Spyke_ZGZ: @Lusciousdan Same boat. It's never fun to watch someone get ACTUALLY hurt. UFC I can watch simply because it's not the INTENTION to hurt each other, but both fighters are well aware of the risks.
[0:24:37] Lusciousdan: There's the occasional goon or cheapshot artist I don't mind watching em get smoked @Topher_IRL LUL
[0:24:41] Spyke_ZGZ: Football and other sports have freak accidents. Combat sports are basically "Fuck around and find out"
[0:24:58] SavedEight_ZGZ: Cam Newton just got jumped by 6 guys the other day. handled every single one lol
[0:25:09] SavedEight_ZGZ: those NFL players are huge, dont let em fool ya
[0:25:11] Spyke_ZGZ: FUCK BRAD MARCHAND
[0:25:11] Topher_IRL: @Lusciousdan Or anyone whose middle name is Percy
[0:25:15] aginsb: the football issues arent even the major injuries. Its the guys in the trenches who are constantly running into each other and bruising their brains every play
[0:25:32] aginsb: @SavedEight_ZGZ dude was basically laughing at them
[0:25:45] SavedEight_ZGZ: @aginsb LUL LUL LUL
[0:25:55] StreamElements: Link to my YouTube Page, HIT THAT SUB BUTTON!! - https://www.youtube.com/c/ZeegersTV
[0:25:59] Spyke_ZGZ: @SavedEight_ZGZ Cam Newton is a prime example of a player who's injuries were mismanaged and then he was just thrown away when he wasn't "useful" anymore...
[0:25:59] drowzyX: zeegs Pog
[0:26:03] Lusciousdan: The average asshole on the street is out of shape and has no idea how to throw a punch, not shocked an elite athlete + security easily handled em
[0:26:29] Lusciousdan: Cam was a beast for a QB
[0:26:54] Spyke_ZGZ: Cam WAS our franchise. But he had a single bad game that just happened to be a Super Bowl and everyone just fucking jumped on him.
[0:27:02] Lusciousdan: Like I got my ass kicked shoveling snow yesterday
[0:27:15] Spyke_ZGZ: Man goes essentially 20-0 to get there and had a slip. Whoopty fucking doo.
[0:27:22] SavedEight_ZGZ: Cams a fuckin beast for sure lol
[0:27:26] drowzyX: i just liked watching tom brady
[0:27:30] Broseph33: so as a flames fan you haven’t been excited in your adult life
[0:27:37] Lusciousdan: I kinda wonder how much they would have turned on him if it wasn't for his "fashion"
[0:27:49] SavedEight_ZGZ: dudes 6"5 250. all fkn muscle too. big guy
[0:27:51] drowzyX: dude had an arm and read defenses so fast
[0:28:07] Spyke_ZGZ: Cam Newton, Luke Kuechley, Christian McCaffrey. Three players who would've been in the HoF for the Panthers but the org sucks absolute dick at actually helping injured players.
[0:28:20] Spyke_ZGZ: Thankfully they traded CMC somewhere decent before they ruined his career...
[0:28:37] SavedEight_ZGZ: i trade pokemon cards. you, uhh, wanna come watch me sometime??
[0:28:37] StreamElements: They're obviously not Pokemons they're PALS!
[0:28:44] Broseph33: yea we’ve all seen those movies too Zeegs

[0:29:26] drowzyX: i like the kill speed on priest lol
[0:29:28] Spyke_ZGZ: Speaking of players not being able to live up to their hype/potential: Fucking Connor McDavid man.
[0:29:33] drowzyX: im used to it lol
[0:29:37] Spyke_ZGZ: Edmonton needs to go ahead and pull a Gretsky and LET HIM GO

[0:30:59] AmandaMarie_ZGZ: @hyldster_zgz I am good thanks!! day off so can't complain
[0:31:04] Lusciousdan: Chiarelli drafted well but made just awful decisions everywhere else. Holland made a couple good deals/signings, but some awful ones, and literally nobody that he's drafted is any good
[0:31:04] Spyke_ZGZ: They have McDavid
[0:31:05] Spyke_ZGZ: That works
[0:31:08] drowzyX: my husky has to go into surgery today, 2 rotten teeth, and a mass on her side

[0:32:44] Lusciousdan: I still have no idea wtf happened to Huberdon't
[0:32:50] Spyke_ZGZ: Alright Armchair GMs, actual question now: Do you sign a 52-year old Jaromir Jagr given the option?
[0:32:51] Broseph33: as a visitor who’s been to Calgary and Edmonton dozens of times each, I’d much rather live in Calgary
[0:32:56] Lusciousdan: Doesn't Goudreau have like 6 goals this year

[0:41:58] Zeegers: that’s wild
[0:42:37] Broseph33: my bosses sister was at work one day talking about how there was like 25 houses in the area they bought and 20 were owned by Canadians, they all pooled together to pay security company to check their places

[0:43:27] Bewts: My parents bought a place in Mesa AZ around 2010 and it's gone up in value by half a million
[0:44:14] Broseph33: it’s impressive depending on the original price. lots of places scaled wildly
[0:45:08] Broseph33: my grandparents paid 40k cash for their house in BC around 1990 when they retired. when my grandpa died she sold for like 800k
[0:45:09] Bewts: That was right after the 08 recession so stuff was dirt cheap

[0:50:45] Bewts: I remember going to Salmon Arm like 15 years ago. Absolute houseboat debauchery
[0:50:52] Broseph33: I remember watching the sockeye run as a kid and the river where they spawned at the end had so many fucking fish they would jump out of the water and hit each other and land on the shore, you would be watching and kicking them back in

[0:52:50] Topher_IRL: We had like... two real snows

[0:54:39] Broseph33: we got stopped on the highway driving out because helicopters and water bombers had to bomb the side of the highway before we could drive by
[0:54:47] Bewts: Then forestry used my driveway as their base of operations for 3 months

[3:35:44] Convoak: He was probably teaching “The Art of the Protein Shake” in other countries.
[3:35:54] Slarptoad: Nah just been getting business deals together. Everyone thought prison though
[3:36:23] YorathofBadamshire_ZGZ: His wife finally won
[3:36:26] YorathofBadamshire_ZGZ: He doesn't game
[3:36:29] Slarptoad: Yeah played a little d2, been raiding in SOD, CSgo and just got last epoch

[3:37:25] drewbullx: you're gonna die to ice blocks
[3:37:39] YorathofBadamshire_ZGZ: Put the priest on full time dispel in 2nd phase

[3:37:42] drewbullx: @Topher_IRL LUL

[3:38:32] Tinit5190: Fishing PSA in discord. Not sure about legitimacy but it's interesting
[3:38:43] Convoak: Can’t tell, both are small and inferior.
[3:39:00] Topher_IRL: It's legit yes
[3:39:06] Topher_IRL: I was sayin this 2 months ago
[3:39:07] Topher_IRL: LUL
[3:39:35] Slarptoad: I had a gold farm in a cave up in Dustwallow that was producing around 60-70g per hour of meat ore and greens.
[3:40:26] Tinit5190: It's sad to think a single GM could eliminate so many within like a 1 week span. Sure they would come back, but fuck that would bring people back.
[3:40:36] Tinit5190: I literally see the exact same 4 hunters botting the beach day in day out
[3:40:55] StreamElements: Link to my YouTube Page, HIT THAT SUB BUTTON!! - https://www.youtube.com/c/ZeegersTV
[3:41:02] Slarptoad: I love the excuse that its to hard for them to tell who bots are

[3:41:39] sciatika8: my groupo does this too and its so annoying.
[3:41:49] Topher_IRL: @Slarptoad Yeah I get it, they'd have to basically like... look at the piles of them for 3 seconds
[3:41:50] Spyke_ZGZ: @Topher_IRL The chickens were across the road and didn't wanna come to the other side
[3:41:59] Spyke_ZGZ: But I got to watch them do little scritches in the dirt for food
[3:42:02] Slarptoad: I ran with a group that had me tank there for the buttons. Still never understood it.
[3:42:15] drewbullx: yay chickens :D
[3:42:28] Slarptoad: @Topher_IRL They can program NPCS but cant identify bots. Thats why they make the big bucks.
[3:42:30] Topher_IRL: LUL @Spyke_ZGZ I've never heard the joke end that way before
[3:42:51] Convoak: Use your AoE skills
[3:43:02] Slarptoad: Hard mode with a priest that heals less than healing stream totem
[3:43:05] Spyke_ZGZ: Travis you don't even play this game
[3:43:20] Lusciousdan: Yeah hit em with the old Age of Empires
[3:43:22] Sinapts: this seems like a terrible tank spot to handle to bombs
[3:43:57] drewbullx: it's important to tank them as far away from the other necessary mechanics as possible EZ
[3:44:02] Convoak: @spyke_zgz Not anymore!
[3:44:47] drewbullx: quick battle rez Kappa
[3:44:50] Spyke_ZGZ: I'm excited for tomorrow.

[3:46:39] Tinit5190: That's waiting on a lot of people
[3:46:43] Spyke_ZGZ: It's passable sushi
[3:46:55] Topher_IRL: I just fuucking hate going to the Kroger by my house LUL
[3:47:00] Spyke_ZGZ: Don't expect anything amazing but $6 for a 10pc roll is awesome
[3:47:09] drewbullx: 20-man is going to kill my guild KEKLEO
[3:47:11] Spyke_ZGZ: See if your DoorDash has the same promo going on @Topher_IRL
[3:47:14] Lusciousdan: Kroger sounds like a muppet not a store
[3:47:19] Slarptoad: Is it 3.00 sushi since its 50% spyke?

[3:48:56] Slarptoad: Ahh, never ended up trying it. Came out right when all the business crap hit so I didnt have much time
[3:49:04] Spyke_ZGZ: @Topher_IRL They have a whole setup in store. It's technically a 3rd party company that does it, but they prep the rolls in-store. And when I worked at Kroger the guy that worked the sushi counter was speaking Japanese on the phone one day on break so...
[3:49:09] Spyke_ZGZ: Good enough for me.
[3:49:13] Spyke_ZGZ: Oh and Ihaven't died yet.
[3:49:18] Topher_IRL: LUL

[3:49:28] Slarptoad: I played rust for 10k hours I doubt any game can be as toxic and rage filled as rust
[3:49:32] drewbullx: *was actually speaking Korean*

[4:48:10] FaeyeLinn: @drewbullx Insect Swarm is huge. It can't make a boss miss because of the way that hit tables work, but it pushes the table up by 2%, which reduces the boss's ability to do extra damage by 2%, which stacks with the chance to crit shit, so if you have 6% less chance to be crit from somewhere then the boss has the same chance of critting you as a character roughly your level, and Insect Swarm pushes it down to the chance of a character 1 level lower than you are.
[4:48:10] DeadxGirlxGames: ooooh interesting
