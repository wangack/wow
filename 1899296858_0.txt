[2:01:58] Zombieschill: say you playing SWTOR the other day. how long have you played it? SWTOR is amazing
[2:02:50] brock1012: It is slow as fuck, seems worse than eternal realm.
[2:03:05] unowncreature: Same fopr me Id be having fun if i could level faster
[2:03:11] 91Niki: I'm about to hit 60. So I am about to get into the slow zone. I am not looking forward to it
[2:03:11] Regadar: takes like 3 hours to get to 50 if you know what to run though
[2:03:19] XxLodusxX: Im 95 and cant bring myself to grind anymore for levels.... its sad actually

[2:04:45] 91Niki: Well.. yes and no. Because D3 rifts was fun as fuck. Maybe cuz it was a ton faster? idk
[2:04:53] Regadar: Domahine tunnels you run the first part kill all the mobs and reset its super gast atm

[2:05:53] Knocx: is wayfinder launching today?
[2:06:28] Regadar: Both Original D2 and D3 got better with the expansions and time. People just have to be paitent and wait for the content to come.
[2:06:39] DunzoCD: nice someone got a vial
[2:07:11] Knocx: boo, same day as texas chainsaw massacre thursday
[2:07:14] asmodai4823: people can criticize the product for what it is now
[2:07:19] 91Niki: The thing is, it isn't all the same devs, by a mile
[2:07:24] belfastcl: new people in the team constantly trying to reinvent the wheel every launch
[2:07:30] Armdel: problem is 90% of the dev team has been replaced since D3
[2:07:40] Regadar: Yeah but i think the Share holders and wanting to push games out too fast have a large effect on that.
[2:07:44] DemiAragorn: i feel like I've got my moneys worth so far but im super casual my twins are only 6 weeks old so dont have to time to grind
[2:07:47] manmower: because you fired all those people, so the new people have to learn the mistakes

Create something that is a little different than something else and make it super popular. That's not a dev thing tho, that is a money making thing. So the people who has the last say
[2:09:07] KingSlayerYotam: D4 was great at launch, but i dont see the appeal to come back for the seasons
[2:09:35] 91Niki: @KingSlayerYotam It's the first season, a month after launch. Take it with a grain of salt ;)

[2:10:37] Shrenko: gave up at lvl 44
[2:10:48] Shrenko: 54*
[2:10:49] Regadar: I've been watching Towelliee for almost 8 years now and hes gotten better with each life expansion thats dropped  to :P
[2:11:00] 91Niki: I feel like the devs got too little time to prep the first season. It was rushed for the money making aspect. The devs had to juggle prepping for a season while also fixing launch bugs and issues.
[2:11:14] Zombieschill: PoE... mainly super fun and "for the players".. the complete opposite of how Blizz thinks of their "games"
[2:11:32] ackdogg007: The issue is you have devs that  are so worried about there ego getting hurt that they dont want to listen to the people that actually play the game and the fact that they are not having any PTR for seasons to find bugs is just flat stupid
[2:11:45] 91Niki: When I heard the first season was so quickly after launch, I already dropped my expectation of anything. I just knew it wasn't gonna be anything fancy
[2:11:54] KingSlayerYotam: The way I see it, did the builds change? is there anything worth doing I didn't do already? and so far you played ww barb at launch and ww barb at S1.
[2:12:34] 91Niki: I don't really think it's per say a DEVS issue, more a people above the devs saying yes and no to things
[2:12:35] KingSlayerYotam: I do hope it will get better D4 have potential
[2:12:39] 91Niki: Again, money making aspect people
[2:12:43] FutileDiploma: @towelliee have you revisited new world in a while I was watching a stream last night it seemed like they have come so far

[2:14:45] ackdogg007: I played every season in D3 from the good to the bad but they started listing to the player base and now look at the game  even though its at the end of its life the game itself is a million times better due to a few changes in the dev team and putting there egos behind for the good of the game
[2:14:47] 91Niki: an hour ago

[2:36:09] wEiRdO_dUdE: I just think a 5-headed dragon that is more powerful than aspects sounds badass
[2:36:18] ackdogg007: So your going to have illidan come back with sargeras on a leash
[2:36:19] The_Marijuana_NA: illidan and garrosh got the best lore
[2:36:49] Heero_Effect: Thatâs the story? I thought it was about friendship and dragon riding
[2:36:51] manmower: corrupted Tyr as end boss
[2:36:52] Mecabeast: I wonder if illidan will become emotional over what happened to malfurion
[2:36:57] CordovaGC: If that's the case then TAKE MY MONEY blizz/Microsoft overlords
[2:37:04] zeiours: But why would we ruin there tea party up in the skies Kappa
[2:37:22] TheItalianStallion321: so Mr. Towel, what do you think of Dalvin Cook coming to my NY JETS??
[2:37:54] TheItalianStallion321: DO NOT JINX ME lol
[2:38:02] Scarhearth: I mean yea the titans arent exactly the best of people they literally had algalon waiting with a full reset button in case stuff went wrong.
[2:38:06] zeiours: Seeing illidan in a actual CGI cinematic would be amazing!
[2:38:09] TheItalianStallion321: their offensive seems explosive  as long as the OLine can protect
[2:39:02] Heero_Effect: They also need better new characters that arenât britches imo
[2:39:22] TheItalianStallion321: i would love to see Illidan again. hes my favorite villain. probably b/c im biased. i love DHs, burning crusade and Legion
[2:39:22] Mecabeast: Wait till illidan finds out about denathrius

[2:40:05] Lincoln_WoW: with malfurion banished to the shadowlands, he could have a chance with tyrande lmao
[2:40:08] Scarhearth: BDK problems lol just getting globaled before you actually are able to do something
[2:40:22] CordovaGC: Illidan coming in like a mom screaming at her kids. "NOW I told you to clean your room"
[2:41:31] raye_gaming22: Holy ist like the worst M+ Healer atm
[2:42:21] SlowMoJoe_TV: !wayfinder
[2:42:35] Scarhearth: I had a 20 the other week on my BDK I walked into a pack going in with dancing rune weapon and vampiric and died in a single global before i had time to death strike. Make me wonder why BDKs are tanks when they take the damage like a dps
[2:42:48] Mozzeyy_: little vacay
[2:43:06] Mecabeast: 11.0 they press the sylvanas button
[2:43:25] CordovaGC: Illidan an anduin teaming up would be sooo dope!

[2:46:20] Lincoln_WoW: hope Hades 2 is there
[2:46:25] CordovaGC: Going back to gillinas would be cool too to help greyman.
[2:46:25] raye_gaming22: evoker warps the M+ to the point that we cant do 28s without it so if they nerf them the Title raice is riped
[2:46:34] Calphurnious: @manmower ?? I don't think that's an mmo

[2:52:03] danchii_: So maybe some 10.2 news or is it gonna be hardcore or some shit do you reckon?
[2:52:14] Rudric_Ice: D4 on steam next
[2:52:18] Knocx: that game was good
[2:52:21] Sollice: HoTS is a banger right now. I play it every night
[2:52:31] Sollice: I enjoy the hell out of it
[2:52:36] Hizuru1: Good chill game
[2:52:36] BigCTheOG: I loved HoTS
[2:52:49] Rudric_Ice: when u have dota on steam that will be tough to sell
[2:53:01] Knocx: ppl still play hots? i thought blizz shut it down
[2:53:05] Kiddeath77: I just donât understand why people do that itâs very frustrating when you are look for an honest review of a game and have to go through all the riff raft

[2:53:54] Hizuru1: @rudric_ice Hots is not giga tryhard like Dota
[2:54:12] zeiours: Is there a reason why it's review bombed? Did blizzard do something
[2:54:37] Knocx: i used to play hots when it had a competitive seen
[2:54:52] warrenny: @zeiours exist
[2:55:10] breadwilton: @zeiours a lot of it is from chinese players review bombing due to the shut down there from what i saw in a yt vid
[2:55:33] Hizuru1: Ye what about these Chinese servers
[2:55:37] Ckraigfriend: you should try the kalmdor race
[2:56:13] Lincoln_WoW: so what you're saying is that D4 will be on there eventually
[2:56:14] Moobot:  Towelliee.com has all of your Towelliee news WoW UI addon information, and merchandise collection. Check it out!
[2:56:18] zeiours: @stompsville ahhh on
[2:56:18] Hizuru1: True
[2:56:25] Hizuru1: I loved lootboxes
[2:56:31] 91Niki: Because you exclude countries where loot boxes are banned @Towelliee
[2:56:36] Hizuru1: Fuck battle passes
[2:56:40] zeiours: When is WoW coming to iPhone Kappa
[2:56:46] manmower: counterstrike has the loot boxes
[2:56:47] Armdel: people didn't like the lootboxes, they liked the free cosmetics that came with them
[2:56:50] raldrik: loot boxes are banned in many parts of the world
[2:57:03] Knocx: well you could also use the currency from the boxes to buy the skins
[2:57:03] Rudric_Ice: if d4 comes to steam it would be nice bcuz ill get that regional pricing benefit
[2:57:28] 91Niki: Pretty sure loots boxes are banned in the Netherlands, period.
[2:57:40] warrenny: @raldrik rmt lootboxes are
[2:57:40] Hizuru1: Put 18 rating in these countries EZ
[2:57:49] warrenny: Overwatches werent right
[2:57:55] Rudric_Ice: Pog did i hear bellular
[2:57:57] raye_gaming22: rightfully so lootboxes are there to make childs Gamble
[2:57:57] Odinslayer: Odinslayer subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 19 months! Pog
[2:58:03] Knocx: i barely spent any money on the boxes and got what i wanted from whatever event was going on

[2:58:23] brewsuadeshoes: brewsuadeshoes subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 60 months! 60! Let's go!
[2:58:28] 91Niki: @chizu_gaming Agreed, loot boxes aren't great
[2:58:37] warrenny: People were happier back then
[2:58:45] Knocx: yea they fumbled the bag with OW2
[2:58:56] geokouts: we are trully the lazy-ass generation
[2:59:03] zeiours: Did you read the ign article that games can launch with micro transactions and be successful like BG3 has done
[2:59:08] Hizuru1: @chizu_gaming should not blame companies for lack of parenting
[2:59:13] geokouts: we want all the benefits with no work
[2:59:20] zeiours: Games don't need micro transactions
[2:59:22] wEiRdO_dUdE: We go again!
[2:59:28] warrenny: @geokouts The miserable generation who complain about everything
[2:59:43] 91Niki: imo a game should have a +18 rating if it has any sort of gambling that involve irl money. Even lootboxes.
[2:59:45] Hizuru1: @zeiours ye single player without updates
[2:59:49] N3llee: good morning Towel and chat
[3:00:02] Rudric_Ice: i think ow got review bombed cuz of the PVE getting cancelled and also lots of Chinese users cuz blizz packed their bags from china
[3:00:07] flookguy: Anyone know when blizz dev update streaming today?
[3:00:25] raye_gaming22: @91Niki agree

[3:01:16] 91Niki: @N3llee towHi
[3:01:20] Lincoln_WoW: Zelda, BG3, Starfield
[3:01:20] Brodih_: yeah i love gb3, but i dont understand that praise either
[3:01:24] ronny_84: zelda tears of kingdom!
[3:01:27] ArcaneMaki: exactly!
[3:01:28] zeiours: I wonder if starfield will have micro transactions
[3:01:36] Hizuru1: Exclusive games should not be goty
[3:01:39] N3llee: i thought they had micro
[3:01:46] manmower: you saying we got gold fish memory?
[3:01:46] Knocx: free games, microtransations fine, full price games not so nice
[3:01:56] raldrik: Successful for BG3 is going to be different than D4. BG3 has made its money until expansions. D4 made a boat and will get season pass money with smaller updates than a full expansion and then also will get the expansion money.
[3:01:58] Heero_Effect: You know underrated the new pikmin game has been a guilty pleasure
[3:02:08] N3llee: Man that wayfinder delay
[3:02:13] N3llee: sad about that
[3:02:14] Knocx: hell BG3 is just Divinity org sin with dnd attached to it
[3:02:32] N3llee: cause their new date competes with PoE league.
[3:02:37] Brodih_: and wtf happened to OW, its 100k+ bad rewiews on steam LUL
[3:02:46] Heero_Effect: Why does BG 3 and D4 get compared so much?
[3:02:54] Thoreya: islands pog bfa <3
[3:02:56] 91Niki: tldr: people are ignorant af
[3:03:01] Wulfgrym: comparing to d4 is ridiculous
[3:03:05] N3llee: @Brodih_ people are pissed they cut the pve content they all sold us on.
[3:03:05] ArcaneMaki: Amen!
[3:03:08] Hizuru1: Only stupid compare these two
[3:03:20] Molvonos: @91Niki And continue to be so, for the sake of their echo chambers and petty fucking arguements.
[3:03:29] N3llee: everything going wrong is putting it mildly.
[3:03:30] Greneer: being liveservice is not an excuse for releasing and unfinished product
[3:03:37] Nasilvera: all games with a certain view are all alike that's how gamers think
[3:03:48] Brodih_: wow really, i had no idea... thats lame @N3llee
[3:03:48] Wulfgrym: people want to cherry pick facts and make false comparisons
[3:03:51] ohnot___her: Can you not purchase the wayfinder packs anymore?
[3:03:56] 91Niki: @Molvonos Basically. It's hip to be a negative nansy being stupid on the internet
[3:03:57] N3llee: @Nasilvera as a gamer i disagree
[3:03:58] Effin_Steffin: interact key bug still alive and well
[3:03:58] Hizuru1: @greneer the d you talk about even
[3:04:16] Lincoln_WoW: d4 would have lots of issues even without MTX
[3:04:24] Wulfgrym: im still playing d4 everyday
[3:04:25] Moobot:  Towelliee.com has all of your Towelliee news WoW UI addon information, and merchandise collection. Check it out!
[3:04:33] N3llee: @Brodih_ also they made  a bunch of mechanically changes to how the games play and some of the hero skills and people dont like the changes
[3:04:37] Knocx: and it all started with the dam horse armor in Oblivion
[3:04:41] SouvlakiTheBest: the only reason it's live service IS to have macrotransactions.
[3:04:42] Sollice: My problem with D4 classes on release werenât very inspired
[3:04:51] Heero_Effect: @wulfgrym Iâm sorry
[3:04:55] jamarky23: @Wulfgrym Im sorry to hear that man LUL
[3:04:58] Sollice: Nothing new and they are kind of boring ones that already existed
[3:05:03] Greneer: @Hizuru1 d4.
[3:05:07] ArcaneMaki: People forgot BG3 launched in early access 3 years ago at 60$ and it was filled with bugs back then.
[3:05:07] Day_Walker78: i am enjoying D4 i am playing everyday
[3:05:34] Brodih_: yeah i just read some comments and that came often, the bad changes they made @N3llee
[3:05:36] Hizuru1: @souvlakithebest dude people literally asked to have updates you hate for sake of it.
[3:05:51] ronny_84: dont forget the star wars game to.. jedi survivor
[3:05:51] Hizuru1: @sollowjp true
[3:05:53] Brodih_: Armored Core coming out also! cant wait
[3:06:10] N3llee: I fell out of my chair laughing that they finally disabled trading after 2 weeks of item and gold duping ran rampant.
[3:06:12] Brodih_: yeah and its Fromsoft
[3:06:15] Sollice: @sollowjp thatâs exactly what early access is suppose to be though. They did EA the right way
[3:06:16] Heero_Effect: @brodih_ Iâm excited!
[3:06:21] Lincoln_WoW: i think a lot of the souls die hards will be disappointed by armored core
[3:06:28] Wulfgrym: @jamarky23 LUL hey if people can play shadowlands everyday d4 is ez
[3:06:35] SouvlakiTheBest: @Hizuru1 yeah paid skins are your updates lol
[3:06:38] zeiours: My next game is starfield, I'm just hoping Bethesda has done a good job
[3:06:45] 91Niki: Yeah that took a tad too late to disable lol
[3:06:56] unowncreature: D4 gameplay is fine they just need to raise exp by a bit imo
[3:07:05] N3llee: there is some crazy chinse clips out there of them do crazy shit
[3:07:06] Mallaes: What duping thing?
[3:07:07] Rudric_Ice: starfield life of P Mortal kombat 1 so much stuff to play
[3:07:10] jamarky23: @Wulfgrym Im also sorry for them LUL
[3:07:14] Wulfgrym: massive duping problem
[3:07:15] belfastcl: duping? is this new world?
[3:07:15] 91Niki: I knew it as soon as I saw the person with 8 bil gold on a reddit post KEKW
[3:07:16] wEiRdO_dUdE: Sneaky dupers
[3:07:17] Heero_Effect: Thatâs cause your chat is good honest people!
[3:07:32] N3llee: @belfastcl d4
[3:07:49] Wulfgrym: @jamarky23 i played d3 through all the hard times, this is nothing and i personally am having fun, ill be swapping over to poe on friday for the season
[3:07:58] Thor_R: Duping has been in Diablo always
[3:08:07] Thor_R: weird tbh
[3:08:15] ArcaneMaki: @Sollice That's true but a lot of folks keep saying Larian sold a full priced game bug free, but they sold at full price in EA with a ton of bugs that they fixed over time, but not all company can afford that practice.
[3:08:16] N3llee: @Heero_Effect people had been suspecting it cause the d4 trade discord was selling decent items for ten of billions of gold.
[3:08:34] Wulfgrym: i knew all about the dupes, didn't talk about it
[3:09:01] Heero_Effect: @n3llee ha I see, Iâm so causal with that game idk. BG 3 is my life now
[3:09:15] N3llee: the chinse streamers were live streaming the dupes on their stream platform thats how NA got info on it
[3:09:22] jamarky23: @Wulfgrym I mean if you enjoy it more power to you, i just dont personally get whats appealing about D4's current gameplay loop
[3:09:23] Wulfgrym: worst part some people who were trading people got banned along with the dupers
[3:09:27] ohnot___her: Towelliee, can you still buy wayfinder packs?

[3:10:09] ohnot___her: Yeah I didnât see a buy section just add to wish list
[3:10:12] Nasilvera: cant buy packs until launch
[3:10:12] 91Niki: A lot
[3:10:13] Sollice: I donât think you can buy wayfinder packs u til early release date
[3:10:31] jamarky23: @Wulfgrym Thats fair man
[3:11:05] N3llee: I dont even know if blizz has the tech to figure who were doing the bad things and the innocent people who were making trades just thinking they scored big.

[3:11:13] 91Niki: During the real money trade gold issue, they even banned people who BOUGHT items from people who bought gold. So I am expecting a ton of people getting banned who bought items from people who duped gold and items
[3:11:14] ohnot___her: Wonder why they advertise it on their site to click and go buy
[3:11:15] Sollice: I tried Sunday and found out you canât ahead of time
[3:11:48] Wulfgrym: @jamarky23 peoples issues are all legit concerns, they need to fix alot but as i said, i will do this till friday then ill do poe season. i am even thinking of doing the final d3 season in septemberish
[3:12:11] 91Niki: @N3llee Oh they know. It's pretty easy to figure out. Especially if it is obvious. Maybe duping 1 item won't give you the ban hammer, but once you do it once and keep doing it, that's when it's gonna hit
[3:12:39] Wulfgrym: people probably losing their minds because early access delayed, forgetting what early access means LUL

[3:13:02] N3llee: @91Niki yea I think the item dupe might be easier to catch sure but the gold dupe and then bad players trading that duped gold to legit players just looking to sell an item.
[3:13:04] 91Niki: It's kinda like finding a broken chest in wow. You loot it once and then loot it again and go "yeah that's broken", and leave it alone. You're fine. But if you sit for an hour and loot that same chest, you will get banned
[3:13:14] Rudric_Ice: u playing MK1 ?
[3:13:18] Wulfgrym: @jamarky23 oh yeah and starfield, so nope on the d3 season LUL
[3:13:38] spansonite1: Immortal-Kombat
[3:13:49] 91Niki: @N3llee I think they will hit players who traded items for billions of gold. It should be common sense for a player that someone trading you 8 billion gold isn't legit.

[3:14:53] 91Niki: Odds are they won't perma ban players who got duped gold from selling items unless sold for billions of gold. They might still hit you with a temp ban, just because it can be hard to tell who knew the gold was duped and who didn't

[3:21:50] ambiotic: I bet 100$ d4 still has more players than POE even in launc hweek

[3:22:13] Wulfgrym: @ambiotic facts KEKW
[3:22:14] notdustinx: "OMG Towel how are you online when servers are down"
[3:22:35] Wulfgrym: poe players will now mald at that statement
[3:22:37] 91Niki: @ambiotic Uhhh yeah??? Cuz D4 is casual friendly and a Blizzard game. And POE requires rocket science degree to fully understand LUL
[3:22:37] Tokesito: I only play d4 w my friends low key fun nights and I dont usually play games like that
[3:22:37] Aubue: yeah casual not play poe
[3:22:45] Skurt2k: That's copium
[3:22:46] NickLeonhearth: Streamer servers up?! Kappa
[3:22:47] N3llee: streamer server
[3:22:49] cornsbakedgoods: No shot there's 7mil active players in d4
[3:22:50] Lincoln_WoW: a lot of my friends are hype for the next d3 season
[3:23:25] Molvonos: https://i.imgur.com/Ib3a1xB.jpg
[3:23:31] N3llee: but most of the player base doesnt play poe on steam
[3:23:35] N3llee: so its not accurate
[3:23:44] 91Niki: @Molvonos KEKW
[3:23:46] mikael_jansson90: @Molvonos haha :P
[3:23:49] Rudric_Ice: bcuz poe is hard to get into
[3:23:51] N3llee: but it does give some insight
[3:24:09] 91Niki: People need to get their heads out of the reddit gutters. POE won't beat D4 player numbers, period
[3:24:26] cornsbakedgoods: Poe projected to have 29.7mil players
[3:24:43] 91Niki: POE2 will break POE records. But still, it's gonna be a difficult game to wrap your head around = most casuals will fall back on easier games, such as D4
[3:24:59] 91Niki: Yes! We need those games too
[3:25:01] raldrik: Im always like POE that looks fun. Then I open the skill tree and look at itemization and Nope back away again.
[3:25:07] Aubue: poe is hard to get into
[3:25:18] 91Niki: @Ninjaustere Do yourself a favor and leave general chat LUL
[3:25:20] belfastcl: poe is to arpgs what eve is to mmorpgs, niche and complex game
[3:25:43] jamarky23: true based on what numbers?
[3:25:47] Rudric_Ice: POE will retain hardcore arpg players D4 will retain casual arpg players
[3:26:02] zysmos: I have been through the campaign of poe last week and people in the general chat were only talking about how bad D4 is LUL
[3:26:04] Hizuru1: Number andys
[3:26:07] 91Niki: @Ninjaustere Find yourself a nice clan to join :) helps a ton
[3:26:08] rittercam: 7 M disappointed people :D
[3:26:15] cornsbakedgoods: Poe had 3.2mil active players on 7/28
[3:26:17] Brodih_: i miss going to forums and actually see good discussions back 15 years ago, now its all toxicity
[3:26:26] BarrayarGaming: i started playing PoE for the first time like 1 year ago and played for about 4-5 months. I felt lost all of the time
[3:26:33] cornsbakedgoods: But true only #8 while d4 is #2 for total subs
[3:26:34] BarrayarGaming: i liked it but its too hard
[3:26:54] 91Niki: @Brodih_ Same
[3:27:01] ambiotic: Yea I would like to see that data
[3:27:03] N3llee: Again, most PoE players dont play the game through steam

[3:27:48] N3llee: prob from tencent investor calls
[3:27:48] Reubensandvich: Bruh
[3:27:50] cornsbakedgoods: Can I post a link? Mmo tracker site shows past 30 days for top 10 mmos
[3:28:11] cornsbakedgoods: Mmo population .
[3:28:23] 91Niki: That statement goes for anything tho. A game will always be better for the right player
[3:28:23] Wulfgrym: i like both games, so i just LUL at the tribalism
[3:28:24] Shrenko: that website is just a meme
[3:28:28] Aubue: the wildstar
[3:28:41] ambiotic: the same site that shows gw2 has like 40 players
[3:28:43] Sicknessqt: shut down mmos had more players than wow KEKW
[3:29:00] JiberishUI: servers not back up until 11AM PDT?!?!?! NOOO
[3:29:01] jamarky23: at one point it said that wildstar had 30-40k active players
[3:29:02] Aubue: that site show WILDSTAR after they shutdown server
[3:29:04] Wulfgrym: @Sicknessqt KEKW

[4:44:07] Rudric_Ice: do u eat it with yolk or just the whites ?
[4:44:07] Nerendis: Anyone have patch notes for today? Are we again "nerfing" god comp?
[4:44:27] eskivoart: Is this EU?
[4:44:37] Effin_Steffin: Nice Mount Towelliee
[4:44:40] Day_Walker78: @eskivoart yes
[4:44:41] mikael_jansson90: @eskivoart y
[4:44:48] Rudric_Ice: some docs say yolk is bad for cholesterol and shit
[4:44:52] Nerendis: The nerf to god comp was so bad, Jdotb rerolled from hpal toooo HPAL
[4:45:07] wEiRdO_dUdE: I would imagine they will wait until after this weekend before doing any big balance tuning

[4:45:08] Carahail: yea,god comp still god comp
[4:45:14] Masqerader: this week upcoming week should be easy for mythic + volcanic/sanguine and tyrannical
[4:45:16] Nerendis: God Comp is still god comp, bt with like 5% less overall dps
[4:45:27] Masqerader: There will always be a meta
[4:45:33] khrovaa: @Masqerader gonna get my first hero <3
[4:45:35] Masqerader: like there will always be a lich king
[4:45:40] Molvonos: It was a tickle of a nerf at best.
[4:45:53] Nerendis: The synergy between the classes is too strong. You'd have to nuke the specs to break it apart.
[4:45:56] Molvonos: With how long one of the cooldowns is, and how short the other is?  Its marginal at best.
[4:45:56] khrovaa: its hard to nerf god comp because of the synergy right
[4:46:02] Rudric_Ice: @Masqerader theres none anymore after SL
[4:46:44] manmower: just nerf PI instead
[4:46:49] Eshel: Eshel subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 12 months! 
[4:46:59] Nerendis: Yeah, terrible design. They should instead bring up other classes that can also synergize.

[4:47:17] wmadsen: @Nerendis Exactly
[4:47:17] Nerendis: 7 Augs, let's go
[4:47:29] vodkablaq: vodkablaq subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 22 months! Yes sir
[4:47:36] Masqerader: everyone complained about "pi" blizzard made a class around that and now everyone mad
[4:47:37] AlphasaurusRexx: if they nerf god comp more then R1 titles will 100% be out of reach i think
[4:47:49] wigangamer: wigangamer subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 8 months! 
[4:48:10] Nerendis: Oh yeah
[4:48:13] Hizuru1: They should have spec titles.

[4:49:16] AlphasaurusRexx: @eskivoart same with pvp? in every game in every genre
[4:49:31] castlecastles: cant forget plastic before bronze too
[4:49:35] Effin_Steffin: Good Lord!
[4:49:44] NickLeonhearth: @eskivoart its the same in pvp
[4:50:08] Nerendis: You literally can play wtf ever you want in EVERY competitive game until like top 1%. It only matters what you play at the top. Just ask Challenger League of Legends teemo 1 tricks.
[4:50:13] Masqerader: ain't no one in this chat doing +30s so god comp shouldn't matter
[4:50:17] wmadsen: That's what a lot of people don't get.  IMHO, every class is 'viable' depending on skill level and M+ level.
[4:50:47] snake_like: is balance way off? hell yes, but to get a support role in the game I think this had to happen
[4:51:08] Syllvn: Just give us Augmentation as Tanks pls and ty
[4:51:10] brilargaming: https://www.gamereactor.eu/baldurs-gate-iii-has-been-beaten-in-just-10-minutes-1295563/
[4:51:17] Masqerader: ya, THDlock X Augmentation man gonna burst like 2,000,000 in season 3 or something

[4:52:04] Jarlan23: there must be some teleport glitch
[4:52:14] wEiRdO_dUdE: They must be doing crazy skips like they did in Elden Ring
[4:53:00] Snabido: Just skimmed through it, this is a condensed version of what dansgaming did
[4:53:02] Wcvechten: apparantly reading it, it's completely possible with an origin character
[4:53:11] Snabido: Atleast what i saw
[4:53:13] Hizuru1: no.
[4:53:19] Hizuru1: you delete spec
[4:53:37] Masqerader: they're not just gonna delete the spec
[4:53:38] Nerendis: 100% did NOT need support role. But we gotta move on from here.
[4:53:49] MrGrimms: wow a devestation evoker, didn't think those exsisted anymore
[4:53:56] Hizuru1: pve has become meme thanks to it LLUL
[4:53:59] joe_g_433: Would it be crazy to think they could add a support role. Like 6 man dungeons. And make more support classes?
[4:54:07] wEiRdO_dUdE: The buffs are the crazy part, yeah
[4:54:23] Jarlan23: idk aug dmg rotation is absoluitely braindead
[4:54:31] Jarlan23: the support stuff is the only thing that makes it interesting
[4:54:33] Molvonos: I Hope not.  I want to play help my group, not do 'moar damage' like some mouthbreathers cant live without
[4:54:43] snake_like: yeah the "season 4" or "dinar" season is gonna be crazy for experimentation
[4:54:47] putodonorte: if they nerf the specc why even play it?
[4:54:47] Nebulizer87: The fel infuser DH support
[4:54:50] Hizuru1: @Jarlan23 devs made it for monkeys intentionally watch their video LOL
[4:54:58] Sollice: Maybe they should have done something more like a Blue Mage first limited scenarios
[4:54:59] LearnedSomething: LearnedSomething subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 13 months, currently on a 12 month streak! towHAMUP
[4:55:01] Nebulizer87: they need to make parties 6 if you truly want a support
[4:55:09] Molvonos: @Hizuru1 ?
[4:55:11] Sollice: then rolled it out full time once they really saw how it played out
[4:55:29] fewyn: i like the idea of adding more support specs
[4:55:33] Hizuru1: @Molvonos you can like go watch video about spec on wow channel.

[4:55:37] ç¡è·æç£: u speaking of the 10 min speed run of Bg3? that guy took the self-destruct ending, which is a bad end, but still an end that  shows the credits. so it still counts in the speed run releam.
[4:55:39] MrGrimms: I feel like we had this conversation before @Towelliee when brew monk was orig released, same with DK...
[4:55:44] Hizuru1: devs literaly said they made it braindead thing intetinoally
[4:56:14] Molvonos: @Hizuru1 Yea, somehow I seriously doubt they said that.
[4:56:17] theDirtyon3: that doesnt count you can do that at literally any time
[4:56:26] theDirtyon3: booo
[4:56:30] Hizuru1: @Molvonos watch video LUL
[4:56:33] manmower: just have to tune how it interacts with certain other buffs
[4:56:52] SneakyPaige: SneakyPaige subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 5 months! 
[4:56:53] Wcvechten: Yeah, releasing it mid expansion is just.. not smart lmao
[4:57:19] sliproach: @Towelliee should augment into Tuskar allied race
[4:57:27] Nerendis: Mid season, on top of that
[4:57:29] wEiRdO_dUdE: Just toss the dragon in there LUL
[4:57:33] Molvonos: @Hizuru1 Nah, because if they don't specificaly state they made the spec 'braindead', which they didn't, I'd get irritated with you.
[4:57:33] ç¡è·æç£: i mean, i didnt set the rules of speed running Kappa
[4:57:33] theDirtyon3: agents of chaos
[4:57:44] acehornet2: They are testing it now like that it's perfect next exp
[4:57:48] Wcvechten: They had withdrawals of not getting not getting yelled at by people
[4:57:53] Thoreya: ya dont touch fire mage again please :)
[4:57:58] Thoreya: 4 nerfs in like 5 weeks
[4:58:06] Snabido: With molv, what dev would intentionally say that :Eyes:
[4:58:11] Akurei87: I just sorta feel Blizz is rushing to hard puch everything to the new classes they add to the game- really strong specs and of course the mandatory legendary as well. Only class that didnt get one properly was DH, due to artifact weapons. Always fun with more, but damn :P
[4:58:13] Rudric_Ice: make a support paladin a warrior support and a rogue support
[4:58:16] AnimalCrackers_19: I could have sworn blizzard mention not having to force people to need shaman in raids for hero/blood lust - but they go with adding a support that you kinda need
[4:58:25] djukares: !WAYFINDER
[4:58:26] manmower: change it from a strong short term buff to a long-term buff
[4:58:26] OznicAgony: hey man just started playing wow today is the add ons for the ui a must for wow or will i be ok without them
[4:58:27] brewgamingtv: I think their problem is some classes go better with aug then other classes @Towelliee
[4:58:53] Hizuru1: @OznicAgony that is subjective
[4:58:58] N3llee: Listening to Max lastnight they are really concerned about this new overlay system/addon thing
[4:59:08] wEiRdO_dUdE: Aug evoker was used in the AWC grand finals to a limited degree
[4:59:12] djukares: WAYFINDER cmf is not working ?
[4:59:13] Hizuru1: @Molvonos sorry they said you can perfrom at best while watching twtich and netfli at same time BatChest
[4:59:20] Nerendis: @OznicAgony Addons are primarily personal preference. As a new player, I wouldn't concern yourself. Maybe in a few months
[4:59:22] dread_kitten: most augs have no clue whats going on
[4:59:47] xhale2nhale: @OznicAgony you'll be ok without, ts a personal thing
[4:59:58] Nebulizer87: everyone's alt is an aug atm
[5:00:03] eskivoart: aug i pvp is busted too with an arcane mage
[5:00:04] Moobot:  Towelliee.com has all of your Towelliee news WoW UI addon information, and merchandise collection. Check it out!
[5:00:04] raye_gaming22: Casuasl are the oens kicking aug evoker cuz they see low dps in meetrs LOL
[5:00:11] dread_kitten: if played well they amke a huge imact tho
[5:00:22] UltraKSlaya: they need to make more supports and give it its own role
[5:00:23] Moobot:  Help Towelliee reach the 1,000,000 followers goal. Click that heart button and join the Hammer Squad community!
[5:00:29] Nebulizer87: as a healer main, aug is my turn my brain off and chill spec
[5:00:31] OznicAgony: @Nerendis thx heaps man
[5:00:44] Multimon89: Are servers up?
[5:00:46] botscast: buff aug Kappa
[5:00:56] xhale2nhale: thats EU
[5:00:58] niddociv: I think lost ark paladin is a really good support design
[5:01:05] Wcvechten: just make them look cooler then evokers, ez
[5:01:06] wEiRdO_dUdE: I think it shows that aug and support need to be mostly DPS with small buffs
[5:01:10] joe_g_433: Cooldown reduction
[5:01:10] Nerendis: @OznicAgony NP. There are very important addons. It just doesn't matter for you RN. Just have fun.
[5:01:11] Rudric_Ice: @Raioktv need a rogue support and a warrior support
[5:01:16] UltraKSlaya: Bard playing music!
[5:01:24] manmower: turn the locks, mages, and shadowpriests into support,  solves the issue
[5:01:28] SpectralGaming_: You could have classes that give leech and other stats not seen on augvoker
[5:01:30] Thoreya: if they do add more support specs, party size gotta be changed to 6
[5:01:33] Thoreya: and let support have their own role
[5:01:34] raye_gaming22: DH suport buff evasion and magic resist
[5:01:40] SpectralGaming_: it's a challenge for the deisgn team
[5:01:41] SmallzzIV: movement skill altering/swapping?
[5:01:43] Masqerader: think the other thing to consider with the god comp is, how big a deal racials impact it as well, augmentation has it's problem, but let's not forget everyone one running high end keys are all running dwarfs to completely negate deadly debuffs etc
[5:01:44] eskivoart: so in dc universe online there was a role called controller and they would regen mana for other players and debuff bosses as well as cc mobs
[5:01:46] NovemberFifth: this is already true to a certain extent with phys vs magic comps
[5:01:51] Nebulizer87: still think aug should suck, casuals can still play but it needs to be bad for mid-high level
[5:01:53] AnimalCrackers_19: Healer support the health of players :O
[5:02:05] AlphasaurusRexx: in the US, out of 985 players that are in R1 range, 107 are non-god-comp classes
[5:02:11] Nerendis: I still think we get a new class in 11.0. Back to Back because we are off class cadence with BFA/SL
[5:02:18] AlphasaurusRexx: just shy of 11%
[5:02:21] Hizuru1: They have busted spec because no one played ugly lizzards
[5:02:23] Hizuru1: simple as that
[5:02:31] brewgamingtv: @Nebulizer87 why make it bad for the mid to high level? lol
[5:02:35] Nerendis: @AlphasaurusRexx fucking omegalul
[5:02:40] xhale2nhale: @eskivoart I remember that role, I used to play it alongside hard light
[5:02:52] Yurian33: could be like the old EQ enchanter... debuffing enemies... take more damage/slower attacks/etc
[5:02:53] UltraKSlaya: support could weaken enemies
[5:02:57] Thoreya: @Hizuru1 not true. rio shows the other 2 specs were played a lot in keys
[5:03:00] niddociv: Lost ark bard/paladin is a really good design for support
[5:03:13] Whiskey_Corin: @Towelliee What time do dev updates usually show up?
[5:03:14] Rudric_Ice: yes add more supports and add a support ROLE in dungeons and raids
[5:03:15] Wcvechten: specialize supports in different things like dps, heals, defensives, cooldowns etc
[5:03:17] raye_gaming22: you could make one with  meele snyg one with range, one for burst one for sustain dps
[5:03:20] raye_gaming22: alot of ways
[5:03:22] manmower: make it so you can't stack it with certain buffs
[5:03:23] SpectralGaming_: Yeah it buffs almost all the stats too so it's hard to do a similar role but different. So that solution isn't really viable
[5:03:27] Masqerader: even with all the god comp stuff, i just want drums to be 30% again lol
[5:03:28] Nebulizer87: @brewgamingtv spec shouldnt' exist its so simple so let casuals play it but it should be the worst dps and minor buffs casuals can still play it but it gets that atrocity out of high end content
[5:03:29] instant_savage: dammed if u do dammed if u dont for blizzard on this one
[5:03:31] eskivoart: they should make a class that debuffs the enemy instead. imagine the stack
[5:03:31] joe_g_433: Yea you could say that about any dps. Maybe another just plays different.
[5:03:45] arashanti: Towelliee, do you still drink Advanced energy drinks?
[5:03:56] wolfieke: honestly they shouldn't change anything , the game is fine as it is , people complain because the top1% plays the same classes but they always did that , even without evokers
[5:03:57] Moobot:  BOOMER BLAST LAUNCH IS HERE! - https://bit.ly/3oCDHWv |code "TOWEL" at CHECKOUT for DISCOUNTS | ADVANCEDÂ® makes the most trusted focus drinks & supplements for gaming! |
[5:03:58] AnimalCrackers_19: Support that only adds debuff to targets, maybe? Warlock support that just adds curses
[5:03:59] Hizuru1: Their vidoes are propaganda :P
[5:04:01] xhale2nhale: need to give hunters some support ability
[5:04:01] OznicAgony: is there any good discord servers where i can find people to play with tried looking on google but seem to find noone in chats
[5:04:06] Hizuru1: Should take nots from Diablo devs streams
[5:04:21] ambiotic: Wonder if they will do the limited attempts in ICC like when it was live
[5:04:57] Nerendis: Did they not keep the TOGC attempt limit?
[5:04:58] Masqerader: it's gonna be 1 attempt anyway
[5:04:58] brewgamingtv: @Nebulizer87 i'd disagree but alright lol
[5:05:00] mavericks312: wrath is on life support bro they cant afford the limited attempts
[5:05:11] joe_g_433: Limited attempts? For real that was a thing?
[5:05:18] joe_g_433: Didnât play back then.
[5:05:24] AlphasaurusRexx: @wolfieke its not about people playing whats best, its the fact that the gap between the best and the next comp is several key levels difference. the gap is what matters, not that theres a meta
[5:05:25] toddj76: how much is wow today like it was when I quit at WoD ? Thanks in advance for your opinion
[5:05:26] Thoreya: it effects everyone
[5:05:28] Thoreya: lol
[5:05:31] raye_gaming22: @Masqerader i was about to say no one will die in ICC lol
[5:05:38] N3llee: it impacts every party every raid
[5:05:40] Nebulizer87: some buffs and nerfs have been directly cuz of Augmentation
[5:05:41] Thoreya: keys lower than 15, people want god comp
[5:05:41] SpectralGaming_: It's not the top 1 percent. There's a graph for classes played. it's the most skewed it's ever been since maybe vanilla.
[5:06:01] wEiRdO_dUdE: The meta is important, yeah
[5:06:02] mavericks312: look at pug casual groups they mimic what the 1% is usuing
[5:06:04] Moobot: Ask a moderator for permission before posting a link, @Gooflinger (warning)
[5:06:04] KieperTV: oh man what did I miss?
[5:06:10] Hizuru1: @Thoreya true in least played season since m+ started
[5:06:17] Nerendis: Top 1% always trickles down, in every competitive game. The issue is the 99% usually can't play like that. BUT Aug is SO FUCKING EASY, everyone can play it. It's not just a 1% thing.
[5:06:23] Gooflinger: raider io says it all
[5:06:24] SpectralGaming_: There are 15's listed with the title "need augment" xD
[5:06:35] wolfieke: yes but they will nerf it next expansion , when DKs came out they were also super OP
[5:06:40] Wcvechten: it's okay, give blood another 8% damage buff and call it a day
[5:06:41] joe_g_433: Yep. Monkey see monkey do.
[5:06:46] xhale2nhale: yea I see that on lowkeys on my alts more then on some on the main
[5:07:03] SMRyan: its just harder because we have gone from some of the best class balancing in season 1, to the worst in season 2
[5:07:13] AlphasaurusRexx: @wolfieke you are entirely missing the argument
[5:07:16] instant_savage: flavor of the month
[5:07:21] Hizuru1: WHy take someone else when you can take busted specs?
[5:07:25] Nerendis: *cough* warriors in classic *cough*
[5:07:28] UltraKSlaya: DO you think they will add a new class/race or add specs to existing classes in next Xpac?
[5:07:33] N3llee: it impacts how the game gets played by everyone
[5:07:36] wolfieke: I remember blood dk's selling arena boosts up to 2200 , nobody could beat a solo blood dk
[5:07:45] raye_gaming22: bfa mage coug coug an PI
[5:07:55] Molvonos: Lust, PI, now Aug
[5:07:58] brabblesauce: the meta is meta cause of group work and efficiency, casuals dont get the true benefit of the meta. Community issue.
[5:07:59] Masqerader: before pi it was lust
[5:08:14] Masqerader: make drums 30%

[5:08:29] manmower: yea removing PI might help the issue
[5:08:34] SpectralGaming_: I thought that key was a 24 lol
[5:08:48] RandomWeirdo_: Leave my SHpriest a long :)
[5:09:10] manmower: or make it so the aug buff and PI can't stack
[5:09:32] Masqerader: or in wrath,  bring a SP for mana battery LOL
[5:09:47] Effin_Steffin: Everyone else has that interact key bug too?
[5:09:47] solomobs: im sticking with my sub rouge i should be fine

[5:10:26] Masqerader: we brain dead yellows haven't been the same since invis pots
[5:10:27] brewgamingtv: since i was playing bear before this season and everyone jumped on it when the rework was funny
[5:10:28] chriswrites: i havenot run a key with a rogue in months lol
[5:10:32] Hizuru1: Somehow Classic has more updates and devs talk than DF
[5:10:45] Wcvechten: Atleast sloot is freed from his what's the best tank question

[5:11:11] warrenny: Hope aug getsfixed next season cant pug as dev
[5:11:14] warrenny: Good vaults?
[5:11:14] Molvonos: !sloot
[5:11:15] Jarlan23: i watch warrior streamers a lot and no joke every 5-10 mins someone comes in fury or arms??
[5:11:19] Jarlan23: and they answer every time

[5:11:28] Subsalr673: I prefer to play teh worst classes
[5:11:29] Wcvechten: You damn well know they're still going to ask it still lmao
[5:11:37] futomara01: what happened to sloot?
[5:11:43] TwynSun: TwynSun subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 15 months! 
[5:11:49] Nehcrom: Now he just has to answer questions like: What is the best multiclass for BG3" :P
[5:11:59] Masqerader: he retired from world first raiding

[5:29:12] Masqerader: puzzle box that does like over 9000 mastery
[5:29:13] manmower: didn't they add a ton of people to the WoW team this xpac?
[5:29:14] xhale2nhale: when they did that in SL I took a break when Fated came out
[5:29:27] Whiskey_Corin: 500 ilvl Splinter trink POGGERS
[5:29:36] Hizuru1: They made dont play on patch release wait until 0.7 when season gets playable logic.

[5:30:01] Traelindra: Slime cat 2.0 Inc
[5:30:03] Thunder4o: @Towelliee you say people are not unsubbing but i will not name them some people started to make clickbate vids on youtube that the game is dead ....
[5:30:27] Thoreya: @Thunder4o dragonflight has the highest sub retention in modern expacs
[5:30:27] Masqerader: i am interested to see what dungeons come in s3,  if this expansion has proven anything, current dungeon design is no where near as good as previous dungeons
[5:30:28] joe_g_433: I miss some of the half patch mini raids. Would be cool to get something like that in 10.2.5 or something.
[5:30:32] Thoreya: dont listen to those losers

[5:30:48] warrenny: Really? Most countries have been back for years
[5:30:48] xhale2nhale: @Thunder4o yea those ppl just want the negative.rage clicks

[5:31:09] N3llee: yea it was just past fri i think

[5:31:17] xFinerx: alot of people relocated due to covid so return to office is almost impossible for them
[5:31:17] Molvonos: Hint: It aint because the game's dead.
[5:31:23] Thunder4o: @Thoreya ye i know,i just hate this people with their negative vids make new players not come and try DF at all
[5:31:26] manmower: yea they should pay us for the time it takes us to drive to work
[5:31:33] raldrik: commuting the most soul sucking aspect of office work. I would work in an office if I lived close enough to walk. If I had to drive into an office and lose 2 hours commuting and not get paid for it. Fuck that
[5:31:35] tr4ncetv: most of these tech jobs dont actually require you to be in office. Companies just spent so much on their offices/have contracts on occupancy and it's costing them money. Also saving on cost of living

[5:32:18] joe_g_433: So you are talking about people who started during Covid? Bc they went to the offices before?
[5:32:22] kokochris: its a huge deal depending on where you are in your career.  I am a remote employee, I went remote  3 years ago'  I would never go back to an office.  Again I am 20 years into my career and a security researcher, so I can work minimal team

[5:33:47] AnimalCrackers_19: Haven't seen a 1-2 boss raid in a while
[5:33:52] Thunder4o: @Towelliee None other but Pikaboo said that selfish people that make negative vids for sake being negative for more clicks(money) fuck up WoW and DF of getting newcommers to try the game because they have the illusion that the game is in bad state...

[5:37:25] UltraKSlaya: they made a 1 year sub for the swole murloc though
[5:37:27] Hizuru1: + people keep sub for comsetics from trade post.

[5:37:39] Masqerader: @Gingerprimer what?
[5:37:40] theDirtyon3: @chizu_gaming no iconic villians?
[5:37:42] Whiskey_Corin: How do you feel about people complaining that this expac is too 'happy friendly fun-time adventure' and isnt as appealing?
[5:37:58] iDeez88: 2k flightstone cap removed when Kappa
[5:37:58] Hizuru1: @Rudric_Ice should stop projecting crap I meet new players everywhere bye to block.

[5:38:19] Nebulizer87: SL was great and Castle Nathria was a banger raid minus SLG
[5:38:20] Masqerader: they didn't pull the rip cord until they hit the grown
[5:38:21] raye_gaming22: @theDirtyon3 yea who was sakraeth and rahazath? before DF?
[5:38:23] Thoreya: the fact that it has very good sub retention tho shows that people are paying eevery month still to play the game
[5:38:23] RasmusAdrian22: the numbers xD
[5:38:25] Masqerader: that's what hurt SL
[5:38:28] Hizuru1: I look at numbers no one plays game
[5:38:29] Thoreya: even if the launch was the highest
[5:38:30] kokochris: SL had a good launch if I remember correctly...
[5:38:33] denflup: we need 5 CGI cinematics next expansion, thats it we need hype
[5:38:34] UltraKSlaya: 1 year sub for murloc mount though
[5:38:39] ravahdk: asmongold is a joke
[5:38:39] iTsinZane: Facts
[5:38:49] wowking35: Roulette
[5:38:49] D3mitr1: Ummm..
[5:38:50] Yurian33: Facts dont care about your feelings
[5:38:52] Nerendis: @chizu_gaming You could say this about like 90% of end season bosses
[5:38:58] RasmusAdrian22: what does the numbers say?
[5:39:01] Hizuru1: PvP participation,M+ and raid says it is dead.
[5:39:02] YoFrankFrost: clap clap
[5:39:09] darkrowse21: dude i aint no debbie downer i will be wow till i die or game goes to 0 population
[5:39:10] Rudric_Ice: @Hizuru1 hmm idk why i see any must be me
[5:39:11] theDirtyon3: @chizu_gaming you arent looking under the hood then my friend some of the most iconic baddies are a part of the story already not my fault you dont pay attention
[5:39:12] pruteee: Again on this topic poeple dont learn?
[5:39:20] iDeez88: but my warrior cant affix Kappa
[5:39:26] D3mitr1: And that sir is facts!
[5:39:31] jerseyfive: d4 is dead FeelsGoodMan
[5:39:35] Syllvn: You can tell if a game isn't dead because the companies don't make any big changes or knee jerk reactions.
[5:39:36] wowking35: Roulette
[5:39:39] MrGrimms: You have a spark you can craft a 424 ring

[5:40:01] Hizuru1: that is some COPIUM
[5:40:06] Masqerader: @Hizuru1 almost 16,000,000 keys run in season 2... but its dead.

[5:40:24] AlphasaurusRexx: @Hizuru1 are you just in here to be confrontational?
[5:40:34] Thoreya: and s1 DF had more m+ runs than SL s1 during COVID
[5:40:35] amoteaj: you will need mats
[5:40:35] Thoreya: i cba
[5:40:35] Wreckagetv: I like DF, but I think the crafting system can be improved on. There's gotta be a better way to learn stuff then just doing the weeklys.
[5:40:39] amoteaj: depending on the item you craft
[5:40:40] Gingerprimer: SL had tons of none fun stuff you had to do at the start Torghast,Covenants, renown was not fun stuff for my casual friends and they quit because of it
[5:40:44] aumixp: no just spark and the mats
[5:40:45] PvtHudson093: missive
[5:40:46] unowncreature: I just mount farm, Dragon race and grind gold.
[5:40:48] YoFrankFrost: I been having a blast this expac. The M+ has been so good.
[5:40:54] Hizuru1: @Masqerader rio says 2,363k.
[5:41:10] Plague_GG: You can also craft 408 gear with enchanted whelp crests @towelliee
[5:41:13] darkrowse21: DF is seconf best xpac to Legion and MOP
[5:41:16] Masqerader: go to all timed keys, click very end
[5:41:17] Hizuru1: @AlphasaurusRexx I play the game and see for myself.
[5:41:24] D3mitr1: The crafting system is new but let's be honest.. who complains for gearing up fast?
[5:41:27] YoFrankFrost: Super alt friendly too.
[5:41:29] flookguy: Donât forget about the flavor pocket too. Huge help
[5:41:40] D3mitr1: This has been the most alt friendly xpac ever
[5:41:52] Thoreya: @Hizuru1 if u look at the same line, it hasnt been upated since june 15
[5:41:53] wEiRdO_dUdE: There are a few elitists that complain about people gearing too easily, but not many
[5:41:59] Thoreya: june 14
[5:42:06] sliproach: @darkrowse21 would/will be number 1 if/when we get tuskarr
[5:42:14] AlphasaurusRexx: @Hizuru1 clearly. all youre doing in here is arguing with people.
[5:42:18] YoFrankFrost: You can start from level 1 and in 3 days be H raid ready
[5:42:19] Hizuru1: @Thoreya true need update .
[5:42:26] iDeez88: now if they made REP alt friendly, game would be Chefs Kiss
[5:42:26] Rexy95: well i got all melee classes 440-447 this season xD
[5:42:29] popzagon: why the servers down so long todaY?
[5:42:33] Hizuru1: @AlphasaurusRexx stated obvious truth have fun.
[5:42:34] Nerendis: Legion was not alt friendly until like season 3 I feel
[5:42:34] Gingerprimer: Legion was ok by 7.2.5
[5:42:36] Thoreya: @Hizuru1 hasnt been updated in months lol
[5:42:37] ravahdk: The only expansion I didn't play much was Legion and that was due to work. I enjoyed BFA and SL a lot. I'm not in a top 100 guild, I'm not 3k io M+ player, and I only do PVP for transmog.
[5:42:37] Snabido: Good ol' legion launch leggos
[5:42:42] amoteaj: I would craft a 1 handed weapon if I were you :)
[5:42:46] Masqerader: balance of power
[5:42:49] Masqerader: was made account wide
[5:42:57] joe_g_433: Balance of power is account wide now
[5:43:03] Baromega: Alt friendly has two definitions: Alts are easy to catch up, and alts can have different experiences than your main (other covenants). Blizz always focuses on one but not both
[5:43:12] amoteaj: yeah
[5:43:15] Rexy95: on silvermoon ?
[5:43:20] amoteaj: I would do it as a public order
[5:43:24] AlphasaurusRexx: @Hizuru1 youre not citing any sources with your "obvious truth". youre an opinion based echo chamber monkey
[5:43:29] Traelindra: The biggest improvement I'd like is a better token system for crests.  So much bag space used & the lower ones feel useless at a certain point
[5:43:33] D3mitr1: I personally like DF
[5:43:36] Rexy95: send to RexÃ½-silvermoon
[5:43:43] manmower: public will make it 424 easy
[5:43:43] YoFrankFrost: This expac also has no borrowed power which has been great.
[5:43:44] Rexy95: ill do it free
[5:43:45] amoteaj: you can add a message and ask for the max level
[5:43:46] cyrex172: BACON!!!!!
[5:43:50] amoteaj: I have never had a problem :D
[5:44:08] mikejensenn24: I think people need too stop listening to Asmon, when the guy doesnât even play the game anymore and still complains about it
[5:44:08] joe_g_433: I love DF but make crests account wide!!!!!! I have 383763 on my main lol
[5:44:13] cyrex172: morning guys
[5:44:15] amoteaj: if you set it as public order add a message and ask for max level
[5:44:29] D3mitr1: If crest become account wide omg
[5:44:30] Rudric_Ice: @alphasaurusrexx  he won't budge he's one of those " TRUST ME BRO "
[5:44:32] D3mitr1: BIG win
[5:44:34] YoFrankFrost: @joe_g_433 agreed
[5:44:42] Snabido: @amoteaj Hows that to stop a rando with low skill not do it
[5:44:42] D3mitr1: But people will complain for that too
[5:44:44] Traelindra: Ya
[5:44:51] Traelindra: No I agree
[5:44:52] Hizuru1: @AlphasaurusRexx if you play game you can see for yourself.especially pvp.
[5:45:05] darkrowse21: they need make new chad mount with moger AH and repair vendor
[5:45:05] Traelindra: But not for my bags
[5:45:20] iDeez88: Crests + Flightstones + Rep, make it account wide and people will never unsub from boredom

[5:45:43] amoteaj: @Snabido well it doesn't but 424 ilvl crafting is pretty much guaranteed plus if you tip them its even better
