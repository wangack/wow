[3:55:57] Molvonos: Super easy to get into everything, super easy to get geared out if you're inclined, and there's just a lot to do that's more horiztonal progression.
[3:56:03] FranciscoTheMage: the 1 percent wont let us casuals ever be happy
[3:56:05] FranciscoTheMage: lol
[3:56:22] RVGdota: @IskrenGG it already is, no?! LUL
[3:56:35] FranciscoTheMage: it is very difficult tho to upgrade that gear or get the mythic gear
[3:56:39] PvtHudson093: Om not saying DF is the best expac till we see blizz stick the landing on 10.3
[3:56:39] VrtniPatuljak: I dont even want that PC, tax alone would be $2k KEKW
[3:57:08] HopeThePriest: Fastest and most enjoyable
[3:57:09] Nokterian: DF is my favourite expansions next to BFA and Legion
[3:57:19] FranciscoTheMage: wait wait.. @IskrenGG you saying d4 is gonna be dead?
[3:57:27] Molvonos: tippie-toe Tyr
[3:57:43] FranciscoTheMage: lord what is this .. "hype chat"
[3:57:52] Molvonos: Youtube Superchat, basically
[3:58:11] Mr_andy51: Was hoping the profession system would apply to more than just DF, but solid expac nonetheless
[3:58:21] Nokterian: @Molvonos be very very quiet he hunting wabbits LUL
[3:58:33] FranciscoTheMage: it seems like bits
[3:58:50] Molvonos: @Mr_andy51 What do you mean?  You mean applying the DF Profession system to previous expansions professions?
[3:59:00] FranciscoTheMage: lol is that what that chick all over twitter is getting when she licks ice cream and pops popcorn in her curling iron
[3:59:48] Thoreya: legion vibes

[4:00:26] Colt_Engineer: look at my boi Tyr
[4:00:26] Thoreya: do u guys want AP? lol
[4:00:27] Nokterian: Im also not part of the 0.1%
[4:00:29] Thoreya: idk
[4:00:30] Mr_andy51: @Mr_andy51 yeah, with chromiewalking still being prominent.  I get the amount of overhaul needed to make *every* expac utilize a rarity system with work orders, but that caught my eye initially
[4:00:38] itzzjustquinn: @Towelliee does the dungeon finder really work or you still want to find a guild to join??
[4:00:39] zoonerino: i feel like that how modern games work
[4:00:39] abracka_: it's okay to play other games, and DF gives you the freedom to do so
[4:00:50] FranciscoTheMage: lol so @Towelliee you not loggiing on every 1hr to do a tim rift?
[4:01:10] Thoreya: do we want AP back
[4:01:17] Molvonos: @Mr_andy51 I think t hey wanted to see what kind of reception it got before they did anything major.  Unsure they could realistically retroactively change the old systems, since a lot of the old systems are pretty unique too (Vanilla making you choose specializations, for example)
[4:01:19] dodgydad33: Kinda lends itself to what he said about it being casual, right?
[4:01:20] Thoreya: is the main question
[4:01:23] FranciscoTheMage: NO NO NO

[4:02:29] Colt_Engineer: @FranciscoTheMage I've been saying this since Legion
[4:03:11] Mr_andy51: @Mr_andy51 Absolutely agree with you.  I just see that it would incentivize using a profession during your levelling phase instead of buying tokens for heirlooms
[4:03:26] FranciscoTheMage: well not just you.. its all over wow twitter. people fiending for artifact weapons and not knowing the grind it used
[4:03:43] Colt_Engineer: no Tyr Sadge

[4:10:35] wEiRdO_dUdE: @FranciscoTheMage Alts can go straight into the cavern but to unlock the rep track you have to do the quests again on them
