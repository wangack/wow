[0:25:07] mp4kv: yeah narration needs more compressed

[0:25:10] italmobster99: yeah thats pretty good
[0:25:12] CallMeDoubleYou: infomercial

[0:25:26] Nutzens: It's close. lot of attention in it
[0:25:27] slowjam: i feel like if you did the voiceover like you're talking right now, it would be better

[0:25:33] redwood013: writing was good imo
[0:25:34] Mikylin: maybe get someone to do the voiceover or mix the voiceover
[0:25:35] xCapD: Need context for  "Did something for the first time"
[0:25:35] DeyarK: Just talk normal, dont try to announce what you are saying
[0:25:36] Moisted_Melons: I like the pace of the stream very chill adventurous but maybe theres a part thats fast pace which shows demon hours drinking waterbomb festival fun drinking with do and cook
[0:25:36] TheNotoriousAlexx: It‚Äôs been a long time I haven‚Äôt done something for the first time!! , I like it !! Making me want to travel

[0:25:46] italmobster99: yupp that's a great start
[0:25:46] Classic_Omar: if there is a good clip of you saying what you're voiceover is i think that would be good

[0:25:46] Nutzens: smooth
[0:25:48] aRREuzs: modLit modLit modLit
[0:25:49] TalonlI: The copy is really good. I think the voice over needs to feel more nature/casual. It sounds like you're reading a script
[0:25:51] Joostisis: needs more personality, why are special compared to other live bloggers
[0:25:53] hobokg: clip selection was really good
[0:25:56] ivsdota: !japan

[0:26:19] Mikylin: yes, voiceover is very descriptive, instead of exited, as the video is...
[0:26:20] Moisted_Melons: i feel like the jakenbake experience needs to tease the degen with 1 or 2 clips
[0:26:20] TodoGuts: The narration sounds a little like those TV commercials trying to sell you a trip to Hawaii. But the video is good.
[0:26:23] Bullet_Drifter: ya the voice over needs a redo. it feels you are talking slow. ya it feels off.
[0:26:23] watsupyouguys: @mardiros17 cmonList slowjam Andles1
[0:26:31] girogirogiro: @TodoGuts LULW
[0:26:31] Classic_Omar: less voiceover, less words
[0:26:35] Mikylin: so its a bit odd, very exciting video for a very chill voice..
[0:26:41] emulsionflow: LUL
[0:26:45] VideoBite: can you explain the message of the video one more time.
[0:26:53] Nutzens: Elevator speech. you only have 30-60 seconds to introduce yourself to a potential, anybody, and deliver who you are
[0:26:55] Lobo_SF: and more passion in the voice
[0:26:57] TalonlI: I think the Japanese lofi would suit better. Maybe a 10 second summary of your story (how you got to doing what you're doing).
[0:26:58] slowjam: I think it should show more interactions with friends. I think lots of us follow you for the interactions and friendships you make
[0:26:58] Andles1: 50 more takes inc PepeLaugh
[0:26:59] FCLiver: maybe explain how u got into streaming or to long ?

[0:27:17] cyclingpanda: t2tHey
[0:27:21] Classic_Omar: take a shot or 2 before you redo the voiceover KEKW
[0:27:21] CallMeDoubleYou: to those who know u and watch u regularly the VO is weird but the companies wont know a difference tbh
[0:27:22] mp4kv: i think some more breathing room between voice lines
[0:27:24] MKings2505: i liked the collection of clips
[0:27:31] FCLiver: true w
[0:27:31] Dewwsix: Try to talk like you‚Äôre talking to a friend and not to a mic

[0:27:38] jasquatch: @CallMeDoubleYou good point LUL
[0:27:42] hobokg: You have to act harder Jake, the rent is due

[0:27:58] VideoBite: its just a rough cut guys lol

[0:28:02] papislounge: Do you okay gta
[0:28:03] angiebrownsugg: It‚Äôs was cool
[0:28:03] ThaSmokey: i think you should add something in there that can give them an idea of the size and type of audience you connect with.
[0:28:04] mardii17: Smooth THIS
[0:28:06] Nutzens: Only a few
[0:28:08] cinnamonsrice: Do you have a clip of you showing gear? Feels like that shows more of how you do it

[0:29:36] ViperX214: what I like to do is either overall turn it down or slightly deafen it whilst youre talking on the voiceover
[0:29:40] girogirogiro: POG lets goooo
[0:29:41] myst3001: jnbL @watsupyouguys

[0:29:45] jepps_ctr: What about changing the closing statement to a call to action? ‚ÄúCome along and let‚Äôs experience something for the first time, together‚Äù it ties more to how you say earlier that you want to bring everyone together

[0:31:49] labelkillz: sounds so scripted though, be yourself like you usuallyl do
[0:31:50] Classic_Omar: I think a mashup of your clips explaining who youa re what you would be cool
[0:31:51] mardii17: I think you should talk in the same you you‚Äôd talk to chat
[0:31:54] Nutzens: think it's in the timing of the frames. maybe there's something small that could be tweaked
[0:31:56] TriBoneHardo: maybe sprinkle a bit of your personality in the voice over
[0:31:56] mardii17: When you introduce the stream
[0:31:58] hobokg: Shroud Pog
[0:32:03] Andles1: what was that? it looked bussin

[0:32:34] myst3001: it sounds like you are talking to a class of people instead of a 1 on 1. feels less intimate
[0:32:35] cyclingpanda: should've put we eat hamburgers all over the world LUL
[0:32:36] labelkillz: you can tell you're reading though. read it as if you're talking to a homie

[2:12:28] gritz_n_pitz: Yes
[2:12:38] OniiJabroniChan: That other song reminded me of Vindu
[2:12:38] burts: so you're going more for a serious tone for this video?
[2:12:39] CallMeInfinity: maybe look up a lofi type beat instead and hit up the producer, little more work but i suppose thats safe?
[2:12:45] Boomix: use chinese songs, there is no copyright law in china KEKW
[2:12:49] OniiJabroniChan: Itomori a dope song, but it is just a loop
[2:12:57] PocketCrab: Can you read the script but in your samurai narrator voice instead? POG
[2:12:57] Keanuu: script is fine, just read it naturally. casual and to the point and itll come across well
[2:12:59] KANZENNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNN: so more of a chill song?
[2:13:01] Distortronix: the song is the most important part. probably best not to edit further until you have one

[2:18:49] Lobo_SF: i like arigato better, but this is nice
[2:19:03] Smith6612: @burts Would have to be a very good track, IMO. I think the video needs some variety of beats and drops

[2:20:33] burts: @Smith6612 i mean like a track that has good variety, but the different parts condensed to 1 min (not like a whole 1 min slice). mixing different tracks might be too jarring or not match
[2:20:37] TwiceTzuyu: i think arigato is the song, just gotta find the perfect part
[2:20:48] Jeebleschrist: Test

[3:05:42] SurrealBeyond: Oh my bad, thought it was meant to be cringe
[3:05:43] Keanuu: "my goal is to bring people from across the world together" ?
[3:05:48] baldur_v: Maybe cut "a little bit" it sounds cheesy
[3:05:48] MassiveFartRecycling: bring people closer through the interwebs
[3:05:54] Distortronix: sure
[3:05:58] semi14: I use a fire hydrant tap for the first time today
[3:06:10] ferlUno: I just have one goal, to bring‚Ä¶.
[3:06:10] Keanuu: "my goal is to bring people from all across the world together" ?
[3:06:14] JBCR85: maybe say I have one goal, without the just
[3:06:16] iamgabe69: @semi14 congrats
[3:06:21] PocketCrab: I think it was fine as is
[3:06:23] semi14: I was within 1 foot of a hummingbird the other day for the first time
[3:06:28] MONSTERSbruh: Pause after across the world for montage video editing
[3:06:47] Soopagodx: instead of "to bring" change to bringing
[3:06:47] semi14: granted this was not me acting, rather the hummingbird flew to me.
[3:06:58] NanusWoW: !japan
[3:06:58] StreamElements: When is Jake going back to Japan ? https://clips.twitch.tv/ColorfulEnjoyableJamWoofer-QPKUCC-d2M-N2tkF
[3:06:58] semi14: I must find something to do for the first time.
[3:06:59] MassiveFartRecycling: reminds me of school projects and emails... overthinking every sentence
[3:07:02] Starwinpikachu: Do multiple takes and see how it is
[3:07:03] KhromeXD: I think you can remove the last sentence of the 3rd paragraph
[3:07:04] Soopagodx: to match exploring, making, taking
[3:07:18] Distortronix: "to experience what the world has to offer with you"
[3:07:20] Keanuu: my goal is ?
[3:07:23] ferlUno: Going to end up sounding corporate
[3:07:37] Soopagodx: it's the progressive aspect
[3:07:40] NedetTheShinigami: jnbHey @jakenbakeLIVE
[3:07:40] Keanuu: read it with "my goal  is"
[3:07:41] JiGGAs159: English AP?
[3:07:41] Sp3iler: get rid of "just"
[3:07:42] noRoidsjusRage: this sounds too fabricated and tryhard
[3:07:45] MONSTERSbruh: I think the one goal part should be your end quote
[3:07:46] ItzNataliyah: remove the limitations people have to experience the world?
[3:08:00] sonuu: hi
[3:08:10] MassiveFartRecycling: is this for a tiktok trailer
[3:08:13] furriou5: i think it sounds good
[3:08:16] Keanuu: isnt " i just have one goal " future tense?
[3:08:23] Ouro98: just do the script perfectly first the clips will come later don't worry about it, I'm sure @Distortronix will do a good job editing it.
[3:08:26] PocketCrab: Just freestyle one take and stick to it
[3:08:28] sonuu: here to chill out from all the twitch drama
[3:08:28] iamgabe69: try one take without script
[3:08:35] Soopagodx: honestly sounds good
[3:08:39] baldur_v: "a little bit" sounds cheesy. its an overused phrase
[3:08:42] NedetTheShinigami: t2tHey @PocketCrab

[3:09:47] Sp3iler: end is bad
[3:09:48] MONSTERSbruh: Space out the cadence on "a little... bit... closer" otherwise it sounds like "Your daily dose of internet"
[3:09:49] Alyson36: Honestly it's great writing top to bottom. If you want you could remove some filler like what slowjam said. Like "just" or "and that's" so it's more conversational
[3:09:49] KhromeXD: That was werid

[3:25:54] CliffWoW: So... XQC and adept broke up then Sliker begged money from everyone... then train said he'd pay it back and stood up for him... then Mizkif said something negative about Sliker... then train said mizkif hid sexual assault
[3:25:56] SandyGG: Miz doesn't know any other way to talk to people except to crack jokes

[3:28:20] Mastermudkipz57: all because emoney got banned Kapp
[3:28:21] Classic_Omar: i dont think jake knows about the new slick drama
[3:28:23] catquickspider: i think thats why poki and hasan were discussing and then train dropped the sexual assault stuff
[3:28:23] 0oohu: just like crazyslicks shit was being covered for by powerful friends slickers stuff was gonna be covered and swept under the rug... it's just fucked i think
[3:28:24] sprinterau: Jake don't bother with this garbo pls
[3:28:29] PepegaAYAYA: it is the widespread take for most twitch streamers, but the most popular streamers are a circle and reality show so they amplify it because it involves them but 99% of twitch streamers are like you and don't care about drama
[3:28:29] Alyson36: twitch viewers don't study law. cmon now
[3:28:34] BillyFromUpStairs: mrkeemSturdy

[3:30:21] BillyFromUpStairs: Personal drama on twitch is bitch shit
[3:30:30] DamnRS: why did no one contact the authorities about him
[3:30:37] NiineEssence: isnt slicker on the run atm?
[3:30:38] SandyGG: it's cause it's on twitch with streamers, they don't know how to act
[3:30:44] QuinnTheAlbino: yeah cause there's a difference between a small mistake/bad joke & crime
[3:30:49] be_nice_dude: @jakenbakeLIVE gambling destroys lives. people do fucked up shit to support their addiction. twitch needs to address it.
[3:30:50] SandyGG: @Erdrickkk I think that's crazyslick
[3:30:51] PepegaAYAYA: sliker definitely belongs in jail, he's getting bailed out with no real consequences and doesn't sound commited to rehab. jail might force him to at least reform
[3:30:59] loganxyoo: YES DRAMA
[3:31:13] Bullet_Drifter: lets see.
[3:31:22] Zunho: Time to get triggered LETSGO

[3:33:36] Tomatokekk: its all about views
[3:33:38] Garyoften: it's clear that mizkif only cares about content after everything thats happened
[3:33:44] ben10000andrefinal: gotta be  some drama farm or sum
[3:33:46] poisebeau: true
[3:33:46] evolv3920: MIZ is a TOOL!!!!

[3:33:52] shredd_r: myst3001 : hassan was laying it down too hard. slicker was going to just hang up. mizkif was trying to get slicker to stay --> this
[3:33:53] CliffWoW: I think he doesn't realize the severity because he feels he's always one spin away from winning it all back. So its no big deal
[3:33:53] delof2: delof2 subscribed at Tier 1.
