[1:07:08] slexulol: @Whaazz i would looove to see you on survival hunter
[1:07:13] Highfour5: no yesterday

[1:07:39] Moobot: Anyone who gifts 5 Subscribers can choose a Spec of my "Geared Classes" to play in Shuffle until the next person gifts 5 Subs.
[1:07:44] waitimdesyncd: at least 10 gifted for healer
[1:07:55] Highfour5: damn ok.. was my first time in the stream
[1:08:02] waitimdesyncd: message says "geared" but ur resto is wrong gear
[1:08:23] rdubm: it was fun fking content tho
[1:08:30] Highfour5: but I asked first 😂
[1:08:37] Sokkee: 3 Pog
[1:08:44] Ceribi: 3 lobbys is a whole stream lol
[1:08:52] Highfour5: not as healer
[1:08:59] Highfour5: its like 20 min per roubd
[1:09:07] Sokkee: 3 healer lobbys 20 min rage
[1:09:07] cosmo30k: oh shit hes right though
[1:09:11] Highfour5: ah okay then it was my bad
[1:09:21] Highfour5: thought I could see you play some heal
[1:09:28] Highfour5: i think that’s a bad deal tho
[1:09:43] rerolleralways: play holy priest
[1:09:47] Sokkee: if someone dislike warri just gift 5 subs EZ
[1:09:48] Highfour5: all good broski
[1:09:53] Mckenziehehe: 1 lobby
[1:09:53] dankgamer97: 1 shuffle
[1:09:57] dankgamer97: Thats it
[1:09:58] f3elsok: 1 shuffle
[1:09:58] cosmo30k: he does have a point, if its a healer spec then 1 shuffle is really short
[1:09:59] themightyroach: 1
[1:10:00] shredder1111: just 1 solo shuffle
[1:10:12] Glotai: honestly just 1 shuffle and if no more gifted if you want to continue sure
[1:10:34] Highfour5: it’s my bad. i gifted because I thought I could watch you play resto
[1:10:36] f3elsok: you dont have a dk geared right? i would gift for frost dk Kappa

[1:11:02] emergence_fi: y u dod iplay rdruid yday
[1:11:03] Highfour5: yea but 30$ for a round is a really bad deal 😂
[1:11:20] waitimdesyncd: @themightyroach  but he is currently on a char no one gifted for
[1:11:27] Highfour5: i thought the joke about gifting was that you would play that class
[1:11:31] Highfour5: so it was more of a joke
[1:11:35] emergence_fi: maybe instead of lobbies its 1 lobby and x amount of time
[1:11:35] Highfour5: no no all is good broski
