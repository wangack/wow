[4:58:59] Betrys: dwarf planet not rock

[4:59:27] fynnswow: As far as I'm aware the definition of a planet isn't 100000% tied to it's size but to how it rotates in a solar system
[4:59:29] B1G70NY: 2/3 the size of our moon
[4:59:39] fynnswow: and by rotate I mean orbits

[6:11:26] manmower: bottled
[6:11:37] chrslp: @Towelliee Depending how deep the chip is and if it exposed nerves you may need a root canal and crown for like $3k. Best case they can just restore it with that stuff that hardens under UV
[6:11:46] boxxxxxxxxxxx: soft foods for life
[6:11:47] cliff_cliffordson: You only got a punch? I got a whole roundhouse and 4 punch combination

[6:12:00] Just2Nasty801: ez pz
[6:12:05] boxxxxxxxxxxx: yea youll be fine lmao
[6:12:08] BobLongMVP: they will most likely do something called a partial inlay or partial onlay. Worst case secnario would be a root canal or extract whole tooth
[6:12:09] manmower: eat like a fly
[6:12:17] Cower311: thats why you never pull out friends
[6:12:23] Huvle: They'll cap it if it can be capped
[6:12:30] chrslp: Missed the pullout EZ
[6:12:31] anizzaofdoomhammer: Implant...or Root canal w/ crown. Sounds like maybe you had a small abscess. Tooth chip let the infection out...relieved the pressure
[6:12:47] boxxxxxxxxxxx: i've had a couple crowns and a handful of veneers just on my two front teeth
[6:12:57] jason_tacey: takes a year I looked into it, thats to be able to eat solid tough food like steak

[6:37:55] BLACKFOOT_TN: Evoker DPS is easily the simplest DPS in the game with BM Hunters giving them a run for their money for smooth brain. And people still do this.
[6:38:01] Whiskey_Corin: DPS Evoker having zero healing means they're also doing less damage cause of Scarlet Adaptation. Cringe

[6:46:37] fire_fawkes: no they werent better
[6:46:41] Cower311: in 1 less day overall
[6:46:43] LunarBrigade: They cleared the raid with less Wipes, by a considerable amount. It sucks that the nerf to last boss happened how it did.. but even still. Their attempt after the nerf was INSANE.
[6:46:44] TheUnknowing: wonder if there will be a shakeup with liquid now, obviously didnt seem like there was much of one the two previous losses.
[6:46:53] papas3x: brew or bdk is better?
[6:46:54] fire_fawkes: they got lucky when blizz did the nerf
[6:47:03] BLACKFOOT_TN: Yeah but weren't Liquids Evokers kinda last minute?
[6:47:10] TheUnknowing: bdk @papas3x
[6:47:14] zaackes: even after the nerf liquid took 3-4 hours so ..
[6:47:14] barrowzz: You are capping if you say echo wasn‚Äôt better @ chatters
[6:47:16] Effin_Steffin: Better ingredients, better pizza
[6:47:30] tylerwood18: @fire_fawkes yea but liquid still took 3 hours after the nerf to kill raz lol
[6:47:34] Heyhowsitgoingtonight: papa johns
[6:47:35] papas3x: ty
[6:47:35] tylerwood18: And echo one shot it
[6:47:40] LunarBrigade: @zaackes They had crushed spirits, but still, Echo was just beter.
[6:47:42] gritbarontv: even with the nerfs their performance was way better than the rest
[6:47:51] kodder12: Echo one shotted it after nerf tho, and liquid spent 4 hours
[6:47:54] mjyzzzt: VoHiYo
[6:48:00] aleck1776: Franco Harris yup
[6:48:05] aleck1776: RIP
[6:48:14] Alaquane: preach was just memeing the entire pull. they were talking about pizza for lunch
[6:48:16] LunarBrigade: People need to remember, their mental got destroyed from that
[6:48:16] monute316: the real race is 3 -6
[6:48:40] kodder12: good point
[6:48:55] Roth___: They had already lost, i would be broken too.
[6:49:08] BLACKFOOT_TN: Blizzard should only nerf bosses like that on resets. Let the guilds manage their own shit.
[6:49:09] Heyhowsitgoingtonight: +10 deplete
[6:49:18] tylerwood18: Echo has better tanks imo

[6:49:33] mcatx2: Should have really never been nerfed at that point
[6:49:34] figsaregood: a lot of talk about timing but liquid are in Blizzard
[6:49:37] LunarBrigade: When Realm FIrst use to be more of a thing, and servers mattered. My guild and another always competed for Realm First, and the defeate you felt after you'd see their guild get the achieve would impact your performance
[6:49:38] figsaregood: timezone
[6:49:38] cprGhost: such a good race though
[6:49:42] kodder12: BDGG rank 3!
[6:49:43] Alaquane: go sloot go
[6:49:45] Abetrot: It'd have been cool if the nerf hit when they both were awake and riding, but liquid was sleeping
[6:49:50] Roth___: Liquids dps just wasnt there.
[6:49:50] mcatx2: Blizzard just knew that christmas was coming up and needed to end the race
[6:50:02] BLACKFOOT_TN: @Towelliee Sloot loots so tired progging right now
[6:50:05] FroshieXD: I hope BDGG beats Method. Underdogs for the win!
[6:50:22] barrowzz: Liquid already knew it was second place and knew for sure it wouldn‚Äôt be 3 or lower why go hard core gamer Chad when they knew second was in the bag like you said we don‚Äôt know what they are feeling after echo got first can‚Äôt rely on pull count

[6:51:18] Heyhowsitgoingtonight: they're not getting paid?
[6:51:23] juicemanyuh: give us a vape trickkk brahhh
[6:51:53] ZippoIsFreeFromJail: @Heyhowsitgoingtonight Method for sure are paid
[6:51:55] BLACKFOOT_TN: In all honesty Blizzard should have held Mythic till after New Years. Yeah some people would bitch. But it would have been best for the vast majority of players to just spend holidays with fam and friends.
[6:51:58] Alaquane: gromfaStare
[6:52:15] LunarBrigade: @Heyhowsitgoingtonight What do you mean? Liquid has won RWF twice. I know Echo (basically method) has won more, but Liquid still plays really well and is capable of more RWF.
[6:52:17] AustinOranje: welp.. today i learned there is an AH in Valdrakken... i have been portaling to Orgimmar!

[6:53:05] nightmayor12: They only won cause method was getting back on their feet ( err echo I mean)

[6:53:27] cardfrek: cardfrek subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 21 months, currently on a 7 month streak!

[6:55:05] Alaquane: it was shiny, new exciting. Now it's ehh, I could watch a disney movie instead.
[6:55:14] OdysseyOG: less fancy lunch breaks
[6:55:27] c0mmander_starscream: Raid from home with Porn fluffers being provided
[6:55:29] nilachip: have Preach cast it and I am happy
[6:55:36] manmower: the top two guilds should lan in the same facility
[6:55:48] yofish911: How much do you think they spent on materials and pots etc.
[6:55:51] ZippoIsFreeFromJail: the splits raids are killing it for me...i wanna watch mythic from day 1 ...not watching 3 days of splits...
[6:56:09] Alaquane: preach and jeathe on echo cast segments were great
[6:56:59] mobbo: Jeath was the best on Echo stream wasn't even close
[6:56:59] rimmmyjob: true
[6:57:14] faulen: preach was insufferable
[6:57:19] CGd0c: love his soothing voice
[6:57:33] stabzmcgeee: echo's casting feel like your raiding with the bois,, liquids feels to put on and professional
[6:57:39] Vilkanog: nothing compared to gingi pump chad
[6:57:45] stabzmcgeee: like im watching the news
[6:58:03] DatHuntard: Preach was good for entertainment during slog pulls and splits, Jeathe was killing it with the stats talk though
[6:58:44] aumixp: Preach talks way too much imo but jeathe is amazing

[6:59:53] akia03: U think they would ever change max out as shot caller?
[6:59:59] mcatx2: Echo pretty much brought in all the best of the best from EU. Not much weak points there
[7:00:13] Heyhowsitgoingtonight: You think they'll ever trade players like sports? @towelliee
[7:00:32] Roth___: @akia03 Max himself said if he ever feels like he isnt doing his job anymore he would step down in a second
[7:00:36] Thoreya: liquids in a tough spot

[7:00:57] manmower: not a lot of NA players with EU levels of free time

[7:05:23] scartotem: Wasn't global viewership down across the board tho?
[7:05:41] Hammerify: don't put the race on christmas
[7:05:50] mcatx2: Max was getting around 70-100k for SL WF race.  During DF around 10-20k
[7:05:59] Hammerify: and the last 2 expansions sucked, so player base/eyeballs dropped hard
[7:06:10] TheGiant99: Its kinda boring to watch
[7:06:13] mcatx2: Echo was getting around 50-65k
[7:06:14] scartotem: IMO. Heroic and Mythic killed any new viewership. If you were a first time watcher, the start of the race was about as unintersting as it gets.

[7:06:26] scartotem: (H+M simul-release)
[7:06:28] Fishified: How is the expansion doing compared to the others?
[7:06:29] rimmmyjob: dont think the heroic splits helped the views either
[7:06:29] smashwow: well that data says it was comp wise because that was WITH the drops
[7:06:42] manmower: if they release a strong xpac the numbers will come back
[7:06:47] toaster_whatever: RWF content is boring -- needs a tourney realm imo
[7:06:55] cahoots82: RWF wasn't fun to watch this go around. Something about it just didn't feel fun.
[7:07:24] smashwow: i mean does the MLB Televise Spring Camp?
[7:07:32] smashwow: that's something they gotta figure out
[7:07:36] iBarb: @cahoots82 Agreed
[7:07:54] superpudd: You only need 84
[7:07:59] Vilkanog: 84 not 86
[7:08:02] superpudd: not 86
[7:08:06] TheGiant99: But how do you make watching pewople wipe over and voer fun to watch
[7:08:07] Ballen2582: its 84
[7:08:15] Ballen2582: its actually like 83.4
