[0:16:40] wkd_blaze: I think first boss DHT
[0:16:44] mixj1: That was bs in dht first boss
[0:17:07] tvilk: It's because Blizzard considers it "Pulling past progression" and DHT is just an minor situation where they have to set a precedent. Cus if they don't people will use this as an example for future pulls where it's literally just pulling some omega weird bug thing
[0:17:10] LuiBMHunter: yeah
[0:17:15] wkd_blaze: they pulled dryads after engaging the boss

[5:08:02] t4m4_: Hey is it a WA or a addon so that you can have more talents speccs?
[5:08:36] TanknPray: Does having higher key levels make bosses do different mechnics?
[5:08:46] TanknPray: Or mostly more hp and dmg
[5:08:58] t4m4_: @TanknPray only more hp and damage
[5:09:06] t4m4_: and affixes
[5:09:11] Eliannoula: and some new mechanics as well right?
[5:09:25] t4m4_: @Eliannoula When you count affixes as mechanics
[5:09:38] TanknPray: Is 29 a high key?

[5:13:04] TanknPray: We dont really have hard dungeons in 14 so its intresting to watch
[5:13:06] mohaso21: they are just harder cuz of key level
[5:13:41] Eliannoula: criterion is the closest but even then not comparable
[5:13:57] TanknPray: Yeah
[5:14:11] TanknPray: criterion is most just more savage boss fights imo
[5:14:34] TanknPray: mini savage fghts the trash is not really a big part of them
