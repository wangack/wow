[2:36:32] Schlong_John_Silva: heroic?
[2:38:48] Molvonos: @bantuatha The idea behind Cata was that Deathwing wanted to kill himself to free the Old Gods, and the Twilight Hammer, being 'elementally attuned' worked towards that end.

[3:20:40] kochiee: yeah they killed council in 6 pulls
[3:20:41] daznal: dumb question chat, what rezzed the whole raid?
[3:20:49] Eraste: seems like vesper is just looking for a couple of early M kills, but likely no chance to go far
[3:21:02] loragheta: they only did 2 heroic splits which is nuts. seems undertuned
[3:21:26] Eraste: im just waiting for the echo/limit to start mythic\
[3:21:56] HistNoir: @daznal My guess is the engineering S.A.V.I.O.R
[3:22:01] Eraste: i hope theres a sick secret phase for raz - doubt it but yea. copium
[3:22:12] daznal: @daznal ty
[3:22:16] loragheta: yeah when echo/limit start itll be a different game considering the amount of splits they have put in
[3:22:44] loragheta: @Eraste big copium
[3:22:59] Eraste: biggest @loragheta haha
[3:23:13] cyrex172: what is secret phase?
[3:23:20] Eraste: but hey this is new blizzard kind a so maybe they put some flare at the end of the raid
[3:23:32] loragheta: last boss of first raid rarely secret phase.
[3:23:49] Eraste: @cyrex172 basically a final phase of a final mythic boss that was never disclosed on PTR or anything
