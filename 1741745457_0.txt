[0:06:02] 91Niki: @nitemare34godd Common issue with twitch
[0:06:21] 91Niki: Twitch has always been super bad when it comes to going live notifications
[0:07:02] 91Niki: Which is why most streamers rely on social media to let their viewers know they are live :D Towelliee uses twitter
[0:07:09] TheGiant99: @Towelliee i sent you pics of 2 judge cards i got

[1:24:05] drakehandmoonruner: -01
[1:24:38] strike879: the thing i dont like of tusks only 1 shoulder has the skull imo it would look nicer if both shoulders had the skull
[1:25:35] cabalish: [Tusks of Mannoroth] 0.3 % droprate
[1:25:36] geokouts: plate is plate whatever the plate-wearer class
[1:25:39] Karn1987: took me 3000 kills and it was my brothers priest who looted tusks
[1:25:49] roac: depends on the setting you have but it should
[1:26:09] strike879: only tier pieces dont count

[1:29:52] chunk_the_brit: not checking the kills for grey transmogs now that you can learn grey/white items?
[1:30:19] DrkPhoenix6913: i liked it... until they removed Quality from QA on my side... then i was like - nope
[1:30:35] robbo1010: morning morning
[1:30:51] Cabbageman007: This makes me want to do Throne of Thunder
[1:30:53] Ithylz: It's still weird to think that way. QA is so important for players
[1:31:40] banishtyrion: is QA the job where everyone else hates you? :P
[1:31:54] uhtred_gaming: @Towelliee Morning beautiful
[1:32:01] DrkPhoenix6913: @banishtyrion very much so
[1:32:02] izzlarn65: bruh
[1:32:31] TheZachAttack: its like the person that said avg salary in us is 60k which is.. unreal
[1:33:01] Darwinsprank: median would be a better metric
[1:33:20] t1mbstone: Avg. Salary in the netherlands is 1/3rd of the Avg. Salary in the US, crazy
[1:33:43] Nokterian: also saying executives not being paid more is a myth..just shocking hearing him say that and yet he and all above him earn more than the average developer.
[1:34:22] strike879: QA the shelf stacker of video games

[1:35:23] neverbornlucky: Towelliee this is blizzard sorry we need you to come into the office can't have you working from home
[1:35:26] Tornadogenesis: People who make/work with games for the most part, don't make as much as one would hope. Different topic though.
[1:35:26] KassTR: greed´s job
[1:35:34] fartonthebox: I feel that now and I'm in Canada, making 38k a year. Plus rent being 1,600 which is alot of Ontario
[1:35:40] fartonthebox: for*
[1:35:56] 19kratos80: FutureMan FutureMan FutureMan
[1:36:24] manmower: QA more valuable than marketing
[1:36:35] Sollice: That is not true lol
[1:36:39] EpicJune: similar to how you have a building inspected
[1:36:41] Sollice: You have no marketing you dont sell your game
[1:36:44] t1mbstone: where do i report holes in walls bugs and such ? i found a couple big bugs a couple days ago and would like to report these
[1:36:46] Tornadogenesis: That's getting close to play testers though too.
[1:36:47] Sollice: Who cares if its QAd well
[1:36:51] thecynicalshuffler: thats the reason a lot of people on the lower end of tech jobs share housing just to be able to afford to live in those areas
[1:36:53] LeXieSterling: Come on now
[1:36:57] cabalish: average salary in usa 2022 was $54,132 a year according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS)
[1:36:58] daconcion: QA is more valuable than marketing from a player standpoint, not a business standpoint
[1:37:10] Calibur84: I work for a software company for the Automotive dealerships and we barely QA and we are the biggest software company in the word for retail dealerships. It's crazy they don't even have paid QA haha.
[1:37:11] strike879: where was QA with the bird platform?
[1:37:32] Nokterian: Elon fired them @strike879
[1:37:42] Tornadogenesis: I've never heard anyone IRL tell me they liked "play testing games for a living" if that makes sense; Lol. Not saying it's bad, but I think it's not what one expects.
[1:37:51] Outerlaw: LOL every game except for fallout 76 had a QA team, I’m being sarcastic
[1:37:51] Sollice: @daconcion Again this is not true. How are players going to even know about the game without marketing
[1:37:51] banishtyrion: or you skip QA and release Cyberpunk 2077 :P
[1:37:56] manmower: they make the software guys QA internally

[3:26:54] Aidler: incomprehensible for me why they haven’t made this raid soloable…. all because of this unnecessary level squish. old raids are f’d since they did that
[3:27:20] Asyia3: they lapped them on jaina
[3:27:21] moistbuddha2: does liquid have an MDI team?
[3:27:25] Artiiz: @Aidler I agree with you, we should easily be able to solo raids from 2 expacs ago
[3:27:35] Draz3nx: you need dps or heals ill come
[3:28:01] theDirtyon3: noone on liquid really m+'s too much
[3:28:03] Artiiz: jdotb is playing eu?
[3:28:05] Asyia3: and Lip
[3:28:10] moistbuddha2: would be awesome if theyd make a team to try and compete with echo
[3:28:13] theDirtyon3: Max might be one of the most acvtivbe m+'ers
[3:28:15] mypanceroffttv: If u could get a lock be good for the portals
[3:28:35] Djfarmville: or arms warr solo it
[3:28:35] Artiiz: jdotb and shak were part of method afaik

[3:28:36] Deviation_BigD: they had that rogue guy, i dont remember his name
[3:28:39] Gremaldy: @wigglinjigglin Ya, I have to do every BFA story quest in every zone just to unlock the Allied quest needed to unlock. And each zone has about 450 steps. (I'm even using a in game guide)
[3:28:41] faulen: JPC?
[3:28:42] Foretoldlegends: @lorddrekken So let me explain how the WoW map works. Despite older expansion being bundled together with a basic subscription, each expansion is its own instance. So once you get to the edge of one map, you're at the edge of the instance.
[3:28:50] Deviation_BigD: but i dont think the whole team was in liquid
[3:29:00] Scarhearth: JPC does a ton of keys lol
[3:29:10] swervity82: i think he's like rank 1 resto druid right now or at least top 3
[3:29:11] Gingerprimer: Bruh guy in chat  all the ppl from liquid does a ton of keys ech week
[3:29:50] dreamwalker213: splat
[3:29:51] theDirtyon3: @Gingerprimer Max himself said noone does keys so please tell me who is wrong
[3:29:52] Shok1597: splatcatt
[3:30:04] theDirtyon3: like there might be a handful but not much compared to echo
[3:30:11] Rottencoarse: @Towelliee  drenaco and splat are in liquid
[3:30:31] Rottencoarse: but the others are not doing mdi as far as i'm aware
[3:31:04] amaceika: What raid are you working on?

[3:33:17] theDirtyon3: @Gingerprimer you named 4 out of 35 raiders my manm thats my point

[3:35:18] theDirtyon3: no
[3:35:29] theDirtyon3: synthetically made
[3:35:30] TheRiwen: he is not a old god
[3:35:36] ZakuzaGB: i think in the lore he can basically be as devestating as an old god but hes not an actual old god something like that
[3:35:49] PvtHudson093: Like Steve Rogers, G'huun was made in a lab
[3:35:49] Aidler: that’s how it should be. one hit on the boss and he should fall
[3:35:50] TheZachAttack: its an artisanal old god
[3:36:22] theDirtyon3: the Delta 9 THC of the old gods if you will
[3:36:32] PvtHudson093: ar-tis-nal
[3:36:45] drewetling: old god simlator
[3:37:13] TheZachAttack: i cant believe its not old god
[3:38:09] Zerodur1: @Towelliee Actually just got a bottle of essence
[3:38:15] nevercluckyy: imagine being as strong as an old god yet hiding behind a toothy sphincter  so that random people dont kill you
[3:38:19] 1nsaynCoffee: front to back
[3:38:21] PvtHudson093: run up the hill
[3:38:28] TheZachAttack: front to back I think is standard?
[3:38:35] Aidler: I’m not saying they should invest much into these old raids and change much. just make it easy and reduce the hp of the boss to 1….. done
[3:39:05] PvtHudson093: sure thats how we used to reset it
