[0:36:39] Ronangic: A train conductor oversees the train crew and coordinates activities to ensure the safety of the train, not including the operation of the train itself. Train conductors may work on passenger or freight trains. On freight trains, conductors manage the transportation of cargo. Conductors on passenger trains assist passengers and maintain a safe environment. Most trains have one engineer and one conductor, although some may employ additional assistant conductors to ease the conductor's workload.
