[0:31:07] IamWalnuts: can we poll if sam will forget that healers can heal a rogue in their duel this que session
[0:31:12] V1zyo: going 4/2 should be a bare minimume 15+ points
[0:31:24] Solastro: mmr needs a full rework, no more tweaking and inflating shit, just get rid of the system and rebui8ld from scratch
[0:31:24] Snohconez: hopefully revamp mmr next xpac

[3:17:59] zachgamegodx: wouldn‚Äôt you like some thing else to tinker with
[3:18:00] youngfella: wrath i meant 2s probably
[3:18:18] LifeOfDanDotMe: how is shaman feeling since the patch?

[3:19:03] LifeOfDanDotMe: so it is a healer that is very comp dependent then?
[3:19:05] PSHllllT: WTF zachgamegodx is begging for dmg build for days and sam just says "should try that" and you agree
[3:19:32] Kanoonen: Gotta respect the lamb
[3:19:39] youngfella: @Thunder4o depends what comp u play, theres some fun stuff imo, like rogue spriest, mage spriest, etc
[3:20:00] zachgamegodx: @pshllllt I‚Äôm just talking with em
[3:20:04] zachgamegodx: fun to engage
[3:20:13] Thunder4o: @youngfella gameplay and balance is beyond bad,sorry but is just true,and no nostalgia can cover that up
[3:20:13] tumbro: how long would it take to get a decent set of pvp gear?
[3:20:32] Cybernytez: Sam KEKW
[3:20:46] youngfella: @Thunder4o im not saying wrath is great, but df is just awful in terms of being stressed entire game
[3:21:27] Cybernytez: its pretty fast ^^ and conq cap is removed now as well @tumbro
[3:21:31] Itankarenas: lasso that asso
[3:21:39] Thunder4o: @youngfella they play on very top end of the ladder,doesnt matter which season its always stressing to play at this level
[3:22:11] MaybeRespect: @Thunder4o Considering glad is like 0.5% atm. Anything 2.4 i would say.
[3:22:11] Moobot: Follow me! https://twitter.com/cdew_wow https://www.youtube.com/tenderloinx1
[3:22:13] youngfella: @Thunder4o talking about my experience at 2.3k rating still stressful
[3:22:18] youngfella: never felt like that in other expacs
[3:22:20] zachgamegodx: tbf the stress is similar everywhere, it‚Äôs just a way faster paced game
[3:22:39] zachgamegodx: that‚Äôs not a bad thing
[3:22:45] Thunder4o: @youngfella for you might be,for them 2.3 is a joke
[3:22:53] zachgamegodx: who wants to play hour long no damp pve gear match ups
[3:23:15] youngfella: at any rating DF arena doesnt super fun lol. not sure what u're trying to say lmao @Thunder4o
[3:23:41] zachgamegodx: it‚Äôs fun
[3:23:50] Thunder4o: You just try to shit talk DF arena and at the same time you proudly point to Wrath arena,cmon get a grip
[3:24:06] zachgamegodx: wrath arena isn‚Äôt fun

[3:25:52] Moobot: Latest YT Video: Cdew Talks About the New Class PVP Changes | January 23rd Patch Notes - youtu.be/R5ItK0qiJIM
[3:26:40] youngfella: @Cybernytez i think there is alot of annoying stuff. rogues can run to pillar and line casts anytime they want, etc
[3:26:46] youngfella: sprint has like no cd
[3:27:02] Thunder4o: @Cybernytez the problem comes because there are very few players,and most of the players left are glad/r1 players on many alts,so ye you will meet them from time to time on lower raitings also,when they climb for first time in a season on their 15th alt
[3:27:07] Cybernytez: ofc there are some balancing issues but overall its okay i think
[3:27:41] Itankarenas: EZ Clap

[3:28:03] jasonkbkt: üòÇ Sam "yeeeah"
[3:29:01] Cybernytez: @Thunder4o nah man, its too frequently ^^ like i have them in almost every game at liek 18-1900 mmr. and thats a sign that they dont even get that high fast enough
[3:29:05] EnergyReww: rog is playing cuz outlaw is better with rsham or cuz sub nerf is so big?
[3:29:12] LifeOfDanDotMe: Is shaman super comp dependent?
[3:29:13] zachgamegodx: feint cdr is nice
[3:29:54] Cybernytez: @Thunder4o  but yeah ur right the most left are good players i guess ^^ many casual dont even play anymore
[3:29:57] zachgamegodx: i mean you don‚Äôt rly need it much but feint on a frost bomb is 40% reduction
[3:30:05] wardelswijk: spree gives damage reduction
[3:30:09] zachgamegodx: or against like a demo lovks pet
[3:30:36] kreyzy8: I don't really see any outlaw rogues play spree now
[3:30:37] Thunder4o: @Cybernytez if by glads you mean season 2 glads,than ye...otherwise i highly doubt you meet many of the other season glads on this raiting
[3:30:50] Thunder4o: season 2 shadowlands i ment
[3:30:56] zachgamegodx: it‚Äôs weird he‚Äôs playing the slice and dice talent over 10% dmg in generators
[3:31:13] jasonkbkt: Busted
[3:31:23] Balthizaar: Honestly I know for PVP its annoying but for PVP it feels really nice
[3:31:24] Cybernytez: @Thunder4o no  i mean DF glads^^ S1/s2 ^^ and that were hard glads to get
[3:31:28] Balthizaar: PVE*
[3:31:29] actualreallifebillionaire: rogue class fantasy is being the main character

[3:31:51] Thunder4o: @Cybernytez no chance you meet them that often on 1.8
[3:32:00] LifeOfDanDotMe: kinda messed up that all 3 rogue specs are viable but some classes have 3 mediocre specs
[3:32:07] LoganTerror: Yeah BTE is your biggest hitter i believe.
[3:32:13] LoganTerror: but needs ambush

[3:37:21] Thunder4o: @Cybernytez and like i said,you might meet some of them from time to time(like once every 10 shuffles) on their 15th alt
[3:37:42] MaybeRespect: @Thunder4o I'm current glad and Qing 1700 shuffles atm lol

[3:39:22] Thunder4o: the guy see gladiator mount and he gives up already
[3:39:31] Cybernytez: yeah ofc they are on alts but they still can take the glad mount out
[3:39:52] MaybeRespect: I'm on an "alt". Just a 4th of the same class as main though
[3:40:01] Thunder4o: @MaybeRespect ye it does,i said many of the people left that play arena are glads/r1s and they climb mid seaoson on their 15th alt
[3:40:30] MaybeRespect: My last lobby was 5 DF glads @ 1700. Random tho obviously
[3:40:45] Cybernytez: ye i believe that xd
[3:40:52] Yanzoh: Cdew must be the hardest healer to get trinket from lol...sometimes I feel like he forgets he has trink he holds it for so long
[3:41:05] Thunder4o: @MaybeRespect 1700 cr or mmr ?

[3:41:49] Thunder4o: @MaybeRespect well anyone that pvped season 2 shadowlands got one
[3:42:00] ShaHugs: 1700mmr shuffle is pure potato land
[3:42:10] izza_cat: so tired of being hardstuck 1600 in SS as a healer and everygame some trash dps goes 0-6 D:
[3:42:19] wardelswijk: meatball slaps now
[3:42:24] MaybeRespect: @Thunder4o If they got it they got it. I'm not a fan of this "easy ssn doesn't count" mindset.
[3:42:44] Thunder4o: it counts,but most of the people know it doesnt count in reality
[3:42:49] connorfitz10: I want to see that resto lava lava lava gameplay
[3:42:54] zachgamegodx: it feels so bad to trinket on pres unless you have a shroud to pair after
[3:43:02] LifeOfDanDotMe: Is sham super comp dependent or would it be a good solo shuffle healer?
[3:43:04] Yanzoh: How's rogue boom feeling wh rsham
[3:43:10] ShaHugs: gotta play comp with less stuns so you can bull rush someone lol
[3:43:30] wardelswijk: auto attack like 20% of ur dmg as outlaw
[3:43:33] MaybeRespect: @Thunder4o I rather SL s2 then what we have atm where less than 1% can get it. Even though I have it myself.
[3:43:37] Cybernytez: @Thunder4o  @MaybeRespect  i think SL glad counts and im not a fan of glad being omega hard ^^
[3:43:39] zachgamegodx: it‚Äôs ok for energy
[3:43:39] Moobot: Follow me! https://twitter.com/cdew_wow https://www.youtube.com/tenderloinx1
[3:43:44] ShaHugs: you can use bull rush just to reposition too
[3:43:49] ShaHugs: if you want to get to a pillar or something
[3:43:57] Frostyjoneslol: i love that talent lmao
[3:43:57] zachgamegodx: main part is the bottom line
[3:44:04] Thunder4o: @MaybeRespect DF glad numbers arent bad at all...
[3:44:04] theodeth: 4 talents in 1
[3:44:14] What_ln_Tarnation: @theodeth ^^^
[3:44:24] Cybernytez: @Thunder4o  the reason why i think its bad if to get glad is hard is that many people stop trying and then u have even less players
[3:44:36] MaybeRespect: @Thunder4o Current is like .5% brother. Please read what i said. Current
[3:45:03] zachgamegodx: it‚Äôs really annoying to cancel and reapply cause it‚Äôs a global
[3:45:06] Thunder4o: @MaybeRespect and it will become alot more till the end of the season
[3:45:28] MaybeRespect: Hopefully for the player base. Shouldn't be this nutso
[3:45:49] Thunder4o: @Cybernytez i prefer people to earn their rewards,not get participation throphy
[3:45:54] Cybernytez: ye some get it end of season but its still harder than SL and also, i think its garbage if you just can try end of season
[3:46:24] Thunder4o: @Cybernytez season 3-4 Sl was fine
[3:46:28] Cybernytez: @Thunder4o i dont agree with you at all but yeah
[3:46:41] MaybeRespect: @Thunder4o You have current one?
[3:46:53] Gladiator816: can we agree to disagree ladies?
[3:46:56] Thunder4o: @MaybeRespect s3 df you mean ?
[3:47:23] MaybeRespect: Define current.
[3:47:31] MaybeRespect: Haha yes. S3 DF
[3:48:00] Thunder4o: nope,not current,but i dont aim for s2 and s3 one,they are beyong ugly mounts
[3:48:30] MaybeRespect: Oh, I really like the color of the current one. Yea IG not as "badass" of a model but not the worst.
[3:48:44] MaybeRespect: The horns are dope IMO
[3:48:44] Moobot: Follow me! https://twitter.com/cdew_wow https://www.youtube.com/tenderloinx1

[3:49:07] MaybeRespect: The weird yellow one prob. worse.
[3:49:15] Thunder4o: its liek a worm with some flappy wings
[3:49:28] Thunder4o: and fly animation is god awful
[3:49:46] MaybeRespect: Haha anyway. I like it.
[3:49:53] wardelswijk: ran over
[3:49:55] ShaHugs: bull rush won the match
[3:50:04] Cybernytez: for people good enough to get glad in DF and obviously have peple to play with its obviosuly nice to have a mount that not many peopel get but i think SL amount of glads arent too many glads ^^ its still a small amount of people of pvp playerbase and for the people who want more theres still the R1 title
[3:50:35] zachgamegodx: you think Sam. could do a mythic + that high? nah
[3:50:47] MaybeRespect: People are so weird. If Glad is achieveable for more than 1% it doesn't "count"
[3:51:05] zachgamegodx: but on tr he can get it
[3:51:10] moldybread00: @cdewx who do you cheer for when EU plays in AWC?
[3:51:12] Thunder4o: SL s1-2 was a joke,3-4 was fine

[3:51:33] Zerolol123: the only team worth cheering for on EU is myway
[3:51:34] LifeOfDanDotMe: is sham any good as solo shuffle healer or does it need real specific comps?
[3:51:40] Zartirian: easier glad is higher pvp participation and better game health
[3:51:44] What_ln_Tarnation: yay sports
[3:51:48] ShaHugs: zeepeye team ftw
[3:51:49] asiramoves: whaaz and co eh
[3:52:03] samalycs: is rsham unplayable ?
[3:52:12] LifeOfDanDotMe: ouch. ok, ty. lol
[3:52:21] Knaxxis: Sterge says druids have unlimited healing
[3:52:26] Thunder4o: @Zartirian easier glad is because of way longer season,not because of higher pvp participation
[3:52:43] DaveofCanada: Are Ring of Peace bots only in the Duelist range or do they also exist in Glad? I have to drop spirit link/earthen wall in africa and then move it to avoid auto-placed ROP
[3:52:53] LifeOfDanDotMe: does that change a lot for shuffle?
[3:53:06] Knaxxis: im so fucking sick of rdruids being the best
[3:53:07] samalycs: best comps for rsham ??
[3:53:27] LifeOfDanDotMe: cool tyvm :)
[3:53:29] Lythi: hpriest buff were not enough this week?
[3:53:29] Zartirian: its pixels and pvp is all time low participation, being elitist is pretty cringe @Thunder4o
[3:53:32] DaveofCanada: I wish RSham was half as fun as the other healers. Sadge
[3:53:33] Cybernytez: really? i feel more comfy on my disc in shuffle than on my hpal xd
[3:53:46] wardelswijk: people just run out of earthern in solo :P

[3:54:27] zachgamegodx: the hps graph
[3:54:29] samalycs: best comps for rsham?
[3:54:29] Lythi: yeah disc deffo feels way to weak once you run out of PS/barrier/uppies
[3:54:31] zachgamegodx: you made them
[3:54:31] wardelswijk: @IamWalnuts true ^^
[3:54:48] LifeOfDanDotMe: what makes mw so low?
[3:55:03] wardelswijk: look at tree overhealing
[3:55:22] wardelswijk: 1.35 mill
[3:55:28] Knaxxis: isn‚Äôt it boring when the editors have been the best or close to the best since bfa???
[3:55:37] zachgamegodx: i do feel like Druids are less aggressive with clones as of the new patch
[3:55:39] Knaxxis: the rdruid*
[3:55:45] zachgamegodx: compared to start of szn
[3:55:48] ivolzi: rdruid is insanely boring imo
[3:56:03] Zartirian: rdruid used to be fun but dmg is too high to play it any other way than just afking
[3:56:05] DaveofCanada: Aggro Resto Druids make me want to die irl
[3:56:12] Frostyjoneslol: hpal is boring rdruid has many buttons to match ur playstyle
[3:56:12] LifeOfDanDotMe: rdruid boring, shaman looks like a dance dance revolution battle :P
[3:56:16] Knaxxis: it‚Äôs all rdruid all the time in retail, it‚Äôs very annoying
[3:56:29] Zerolol123: the rdruid outlaw meta we had in slands was actually miserable. I still remember the AWC tourney going until 4 am EST
[3:56:38] MaybeRespect: Hey atleast rogue has multiple viable specs
[3:56:39] IamWalnuts: what if we gave druids purge protection.... and strong tree form that is up 50% of the game... and treants that do insane healing... and we gave them a .5 sec clone
[3:56:50] MaybeRespect: Wish all classes were like that
[3:56:54] wardelswijk: it deffo was holy priest outlaw
[3:56:57] DaveofCanada: I was expecting Rogue rework to fix how cancerous playing against Rogue is
[3:56:59] wardelswijk: with fire magus
[3:57:08] Axl_Rose94: Holy priest iqd
[3:57:16] Knaxxis: and the rdruid play style is soooo boring
[3:57:27] LifeOfDanDotMe: If you were only allowed to play 1 healer and it couldn't be rdruid...what would you play? :D
[3:57:45] zachgamegodx: feint is 40% avoidance
[3:57:54] zachgamegodx: we can perma have it up as outlaw
[3:57:56] Knaxxis: I‚Äôm a holy priest main and we haven‚Äôt been good since Shadowlands season 3
[3:57:59] Knaxxis: :(
[3:58:39] LifeOfDanDotMe: and it was only good @Knaxxis because of broken tier
[3:58:44] Knaxxis: is it cause it‚Äôs a hard casting healer?
[3:58:53] wardelswijk: holy helaing to spiky most of the time

[4:51:07] jBeastwood: cd on spell steal
[4:51:12] Gardon_: ^
[4:51:13] NASAdesigner: @deanoxs yea mana

[4:51:33] deanoxs: cd on spell steal would be the worst fix lol
[4:51:41] Zaiyge: lol

[4:55:31] deanoxs: @JahOCE_ with cast time you have at least some choices and counterplay. a cd would simply destroy it imo

[4:56:13] JahOCE_: @bobthegoblin_ sure does
[4:56:58] Qtpiextclolz: make it a 1min cd ability with 10 stacks of spell steal

[4:58:46] jBeastwood: i think its arcane tempest or w/e the dot is
[4:58:57] bobthegoblin_: @Qtpiextclolz yeah DH and DK also have a ton of shit thats awful class design but we are crying about enemy team
[4:59:30] bobthegoblin_: im not talking about cdew but chat, literally every person spamming arcane mage bad
[4:59:31] Qtpiextclolz: @bobthegoblin_ you obviously have some bias on the topic.
[4:59:40] bobthegoblin_: @Qtpiextclolz yeah I do not you
[5:00:21] mneYEP: @Qtpiextclolz so what he's not wrong lol

[5:03:27] Knaxxis: mages players crying in chat and they havent even got nerfed lol
[5:03:29] hotpocket2077: u can‚Äôt call someone‚Äôs idea brain dead and then not have an idea of your own
[5:03:33] Gardon_: That's not a good thing...
[5:03:33] bobthegoblin_: yeah but there is a lot of bullshit in the game, idk why everyone is going hard on this specifically
[5:03:38] deanoxs: 30sec cd and 5 stacks or something would be okish i guess
[5:03:41] HowDoIBison: are dev and pres evoker same stat prio?
[5:03:45] Axl_Rose94: other classes get punish for purging too much
[5:03:47] bump1: they want it to cost mana, more mana = more free arcane missles that do more dmg
[5:03:48] JahOCE_: guys high mana is bad, and a cd is bad
[5:03:52] JahOCE_: just remove it? :)
[5:03:52] bump1: increasing mana is not good for you
[5:03:59] Yanzoh: No there is no justification, if a class can pull off 86 buffs...thats just ridiculous
[5:04:03] jBeastwood: at high level arcane mage is wild
[5:04:12] Zlipps: that shouldn't be allowed considering spriest can only dispel a few times and then be oom.
[5:04:15] Gardon_: 12 sec CD on spellsteal fixes this issue and makes them have to actually try to dps instead of fish for procs
[5:04:16] jBeastwood: not nearly as good for 99% of the ladder
[5:04:19] bestchaakbestjjang: you guys are legit braindead if you think 86 purges is healthy as an arcane mage. you guys do realize SP and enhancement purges got fucking shit on and had their mana cost increased
[5:04:30] Yanzoh: ^
[5:04:35] bobthegoblin_: @Gardon_ yeah bro make the arcane mage spam arcane blast vs DH DK shaman
[5:04:35] hotpocket2077: give it a 6 sec cd and have it spellsteal two buffs imo
[5:04:39] JahOCE_: and gain no dmg from dispelling
[5:04:40] JahOCE_: :)
[5:04:41] bobthegoblin_: @Gardon_ ur too good and not biased
[5:04:43] JahOCE_: sp gang
[5:04:48] Gardon_: Better than spellsteal LOL
[5:04:50] SteLawBro: He's going to need a whoooole lot more than 86 dispells to take doown the Ol' Dew ariW
[5:04:53] bestchaakbestjjang: rogue and mages were always balanced with a bias. just a fact
[5:04:58] mneYEP: @bestchaakbestjjang bro, no one is saying its a great design.. but its a cascade effect if you add a cd like monkey solution to it
[5:04:58] bobthegoblin_: wait we are acting like the SP dispel changes are good?
[5:05:13] Qtpiextclolz: they are
[5:05:16] Yoskexz: they need greater spellsteal FeelsStrongMan
[5:05:16] bestchaakbestjjang: yeah it was good @bobthegoblin_ , you must be 1400
[5:05:27] bobthegoblin_: @bestchaakbestjjang kk
[5:05:36] ghostgalx: tauren mage, thats a gigachad move
[5:05:37] Yanzoh: Yoske LUL
[5:06:03] Mechgyrasaur: hahah they said "uhhh" in unison
[5:06:04] mneYEP: jape is the chad of mages tbf
[5:06:05] renghost22: just give mages like 3 charges of spellsteal with a 15s recharge for the charges
[5:06:25] bestchaakbestjjang: @renghost22 , make sure its off gcd as well and summon little mages
[5:06:37] bestchaakbestjjang: we can call them mageants
[5:06:38] Gardon_: And those mages spellsteal too
[5:06:52] mneYEP: first good idea
[5:06:57] Yanzoh: ok, now chat has just done lost their minds lol
[5:07:07] SebboTheFro: Tbh spellsteal by design in all forms is bad gamedesign imo
[5:07:12] Gardon_: Agreee
[5:07:27] TheeLoneWolf: If this is what awc is going to look like next week, it's going to be boring as hell to watch... Arcane Mages and outlaw rogues just all damp games... Zzz
[5:07:41] juicymeld: thank blizz for that^
[5:07:47] Gardon_: Rdruid meta is always damp games
[5:07:49] bobthegoblin_: @TheeLoneWolf yeah bro youre for sure gonna see all these arcane mages running around spellstealing
[5:08:01] SteLawBro: It would be different if it was fun for the mage but im sure most arcane mage mains would tell you its awefully boring.
[5:08:01] jared6599: is that the comp the EU teams are playing too?
[5:08:12] hotpocket2077: @mneyep you sure are on a high horse for someone who doesn‚Äôt have a solution of his own

[5:11:01] vancity99: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT1nlxf4gjk
[5:11:11] IamWalnuts: that just seems insane 2 super mobile classes that pump endlessly
[5:11:17] wardelswijk: all classes have their purge restricted but not arcane
[5:11:19] NPBeharry: time to put them in the blender
[5:11:21] wardelswijk: great philosophy
[5:11:22] Zaiyge: also fighting best arcane NA
[5:11:44] Drawow: how is WW better for this ?
[5:11:47] vancity99: remember cdw, at your stage in this game there is no reason why u cant counter youth with wisdom for you at least, based on what you can control :)

[5:11:51] nikolaievitch1: no
[5:11:55] bestchaakbestjjang: i legit do not understand how some of these idiots think this is healthy gameplay. you watch raiku play, he literally purges ever other global. what is skillful about it?
[5:12:00] NPBeharry: better burst

[5:14:17] RottenBanana209: samiFinger samiFinger samiFinger samiFinger samiFinger samiFinger samiFinger samiFinger samiFinger samiFinger samiFinger samiFinger
[5:14:18] Kanooog: @wowsuomi I believe Druids still are, but not 100% sure.
[5:14:19] bobthegoblin_: @Qtpiextclolz im a mage playuer too now?
[5:14:20] IamWalnuts: sam played wrath mage not that long ago its basically the same Kappa
[5:14:21] warlord_packyak: mage monk?
[5:14:24] bestchaakbestjjang: @bobthegoblin_ is another troll fyi @cdewx
[5:15:04] NPBeharry: trolls aside I don‚Äôt see Sam as a mage main anymore if he doesn‚Äôt like playing it
[5:15:15] NPBeharry: he‚Äôs a boomy main
[5:15:21] Qtpiextclolz: maybe they should fix the class ;)
[5:15:21] NPBeharry: now*
[5:15:36] wowsuomi: With the hp buff now i thought rsham get the best vaule from it
[5:16:02] wardelswijk: i might be omega coping but dindt they buff frost dk by alot with that 4 set change?
[5:16:04] bobthegoblin_: @Qtpiextclolz ok but we have to fix a lot at the same time, cause if he couldnt do it in this matchup what would he do
[5:16:18] bestchaakbestjjang: the guy you banned also had a negative win loss at 1400 fyi @cdewx lmao
[5:16:26] NPBeharry: idk but Mes hates frost dk @wardelswijk
[5:16:29] bestchaakbestjjang: just trolls everywhere
[5:16:30] RottenBanana209: i see sam play mage time to time but the main team want sam on boomie
[5:16:33] wardelswijk: everyone hates frost dk
[5:16:37] ooPickleRicKoo: @wowsuomi no rdruid gets the best value because hots work better
[5:16:38] wardelswijk: but they haveto play tourney soon :D
[5:16:48] NPBeharry: yeah just saying
[5:17:07] NPBeharry: insane how tanky that comp is now
[5:17:08] wowsuomi: @oopicklerickoo Fair enough1
[5:17:18] Yanzoh: imo, cdew has played through some of the most broken shit in this game, if he says its fckd, im gonna take his word for it.
[5:17:30] ticklelips: is warrior better into this over DK? DIDnt arms just get buffed too?
[5:17:42] Kanooog: @Yanzoh I Agree
[5:17:42] bobthegoblin_: Warr cant hit arcane all game @ticklelips
[5:17:50] Itankarenas: @Yanzoh nah bro, im a keyboard R1 AWC 40 champ. It's easy to beat EZ
[5:17:53] ticklelips: @bobthegoblin_ ohh okay
[5:17:54] ticklelips: fair

[5:18:19] ghostgalx: @Itankarenas sign my mousepad plz
[5:18:25] jacob_the_mage: is fire or frost viable or is it just arcane
[5:18:26] ooPickleRicKoo: but you can fight an rdruid team with lots purges
[5:18:28] ticklelips: oh boy
[5:18:30] Itankarenas: @ghostgalx 1 at a time plz EZ
[5:18:34] ticklelips: can i get my points back :(
[5:18:49] PeptoAbysmal: you still use tobi?
[5:18:57] Eradivyn: how much more better is rdruid compared to a rsham? @cdewx
[5:19:08] wardelswijk: idk man
[5:19:13] wardelswijk: ur reversion just gets spellstolen
[5:19:13] Eradivyn: like by a lot?
[5:19:14] Itankarenas: rdruid just makes it look easy
[5:19:15] wardelswijk: over an over
[5:19:19] Kanooog: I blame Pika's 1v2 videos for the Rogue nerfs. Probably not true but they did happen shortly after.
[5:19:22] Movzee: where would you put rsham in a tier list rn?
[5:19:40] urack: And what about the other healers in general? @cdew
[5:19:41] bobthegoblin_: Assa and Outlaw are the 2 best melees in game
[5:19:41] memph1s: is there any priest changes
[5:19:43] Itankarenas: rsham is 2nd to rdruid, no doubt
[5:19:46] bump1: try one game as Pres
[5:19:50] bump1: i wanna see it lol
[5:20:00] bulvar10: Yeah I think I blame rogues being so broke is mostly why they got a "nerf"
[5:20:00] SebboTheFro: @bobthegoblin_ Lol assa is not up there even if strong
[5:20:12] Lythi: it's toonah healing for them, no?
[5:20:15] NPBeharry: yea
[5:20:16] madFinall: R1 problems :P
[5:20:19] Kanooog: @SebboTheFro I was thinking that too
[5:20:34] bump1: this is gonna be a weird AWC
[5:20:36] Movzee: is mw any good atm?
[5:20:38] bump1: all for it
[5:20:42] bulvar10: I'm surprised we don't see more holy priests
[5:20:48] pietyhs: I agree buff arms warriors
[5:20:51] dipicat: its tuna
[5:20:55] bump1: no matter what people say, and people hate. there are a lot of different comps that are meta right now
[5:20:56] bobthegoblin_: @SebboTheFro it for sure is, there is no reason to play it thought cause Outlaw has no downsides and assa can die
[5:21:01] bump1: its not just all rmp, or ret war
[5:21:06] SebboTheFro: @bobthegoblin_ No
[5:21:07] dipicat: he has like 4-5 druids w names that arent tuna
[5:21:08] dipicat: lol
[5:21:14] Kanooog: Great video btw "New Class PVP Changes" I watched it a little bit ago.
[5:21:21] bobthegoblin_: Axtin has a similar name no?
[5:21:29] SebboTheFro: @bobthegoblin_ Both DH and WW are stronger than ass
[5:21:32] dipicat: theres andrewceo who he plays with
[5:21:33] kreyzy8: axtin's ret is marvinceo
[5:21:35] dipicat: the warrior guy
[5:21:42] bobthegoblin_: @SebboTheFro its pretty close
[5:21:46] SebboTheFro: Its not
[5:21:49] SebboTheFro: assa is good in 2s
[5:21:52] piffzorz: youre not crazy i remember a guy named that too lol who wasnt toonah
[5:21:57] exaltyyo: bless you
[5:21:57] pietyhs: are they really ceos tho
[5:22:18] xxxmagnifico: lol on this map now
[5:22:56] wardelswijk: i feel bad for mes :(
[5:22:56] Kanooog: @xxxmagnifico Is that a good or a bad thing?

[5:23:22] renghost22: @Kanooog it's a big map, so it's better for the ranged comp because they can kite more effectively
[5:23:24] Kanooog: @xxxmagnifico Damn... I wish you said good ngl

[5:27:15] NPBeharry: thatssoThisisfine
[5:27:28] bulvar10: Alternatively trying to kill a devoker with full rdru hots
[5:27:33] ooPickleRicKoo: just get a hunter and kill the mage lol
[5:27:41] Kanooog: @bulvar10 Yeah....hard to think of something more frustrating.
[5:28:12] Zerolol123: both casters doing 120k all game LUL
[5:28:22] Yanzoh: @Kanooog healing through it! lol, im frustrated just watching those earth shields fall every 2nd gcd

[5:28:22] Moobot: Follow me! https://twitter.com/cdew_wow https://www.youtube.com/tenderloinx1
[5:28:25] Zerolol123: not sure why blizzard even created melee classes
[5:28:26] pika_pala: jesus fckin christ man wtf is this dmg LUL
[5:28:46] Kanooog: @Yanzoh Hahah Facts! Very true
[5:28:50] symbolism369: love to see all the melee crying about casters having dmg you cant escape
[5:29:23] Zerolol123: @symbolism369 you can just ask for kiting advice instead of whatever you said
[5:29:25] bulvar10: @symbolism369 same here, the tears of DK players are thr highest delicacy
[5:29:35] NPBeharry: that looked way better at least
[5:29:40] kreyzy8: KEKW
[5:29:44] bestchaakbestjjang: show purge
[5:29:44] symbolism369: @Zerolol123 i kite well im doing fine in game i just get all melee lobbies nonstop
[5:29:46] NPBeharry: but still miserable
[5:29:48] pika_pala: i wudnt mind casters having this dmg, but its frustrating that they cant die
[5:29:51] nikolaievitch1: yes
[5:29:51] bump1: time to admit Sam was right‚Ä¶. caster meta
[5:29:54] DouzySham: can we please see your healing stream details, want to know if it does anything
[5:29:56] NPBeharry: I mean Druid was almost tapped
[5:30:02] jazzratTV: does training the dragon not work
[5:30:02] eMBeaR64oz: would Evoker be better so you don‚Äôt need to keep earth shield up?
[5:30:03] vibesham: that looked absolutely like an alt-f4 type of game
[5:30:06] bestchaakbestjjang: show your healing breakdown @cdewx
[5:30:06] Germ777: whats the hps?
[5:30:09] NPBeharry: but yeah it looks very cringe to queue into
[5:30:10] Zerolol123: this is what blizzard wanted LUL
[5:30:10] DouzySham: oh wow
[5:30:10] Germ777: damn
[5:30:14] bulvar10: If they just nerfed rdruid those casters die so fast
[5:30:14] dipicat: "casters" you guys mean arcane mage / rdruid combo?
[5:30:22] kvaelma: Mage is the best hybrid class in the game
[5:30:22] Kanooog: @kreyzy8 DK's during Wrath were insane... how times have changed.
[5:30:25] Yanzoh: it would be so cool if they fix spellsteal before tourney, probably will be after, but would be awesome of them if they did
[5:30:27] DouzySham: didnt expect healing stream to be number 2
[5:30:30] thinkablelol: so u think jungle can stop that?
[5:30:31] mjotka: can you show talents what u played?

[5:31:17] Movzee: how do you get your rip tide and earth shield so big on the raid frames?
[5:31:26] bulvar10: @stljay73 every melee has been insanely op lol, remember dh? Arms war for the last 2 months, rogues, dks have been insanely good all expac
[5:31:26] NPBeharry: boomy rogue is decent good into that
[5:31:28] LifeOfDanDotMe: I wish you could glyph to not use dragon form.
[5:31:37] kurtsdk: @cdewx thx for your streams bro, keeping me entertained through rough irl times recently
[5:31:37] DouzySham: right before AWC too, great move
[5:31:41] wardelswijk: thank god they made arcane immortal
[5:31:47] OsyrissTV: OsyrissTV subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 90 months! dewLove
[5:31:54] bestchaakbestjjang: something about you calling out OP classes trigger people for some reason @cdewx , never mind the fact whazz has been saying arcane rmx is the best comp in the game for weeks now before and after patch lol
[5:32:00] stljay73: Has any melee besides rogue been meta anytime this expac?
[5:32:15] Kanooog: I wish Blizzard would make small adjustments over time. Instead of big changes on both sides.
[5:32:30] SebboTheFro: @stljay73 DK/DH pretty much the whole exp
[5:32:48] bestchaakbestjjang: they used to balance patch every two weeks @kanooog , then they fired holinka
[5:33:02] stljay73: @SebboTheFro Dont remeber them in AWC?
[5:33:12] Kanooog: @bestchaakbestjjang Perfectly said honestly.
[5:33:15] Movzee: how do you get your hots so big on raid frames?
[5:33:25] atoker: reactive resin
[5:33:25] Moobot: Follow me! https://twitter.com/cdew_wow https://www.youtube.com/tenderloinx1
[5:33:26] SebboTheFro: @stljay73 AWC rarely represents the meta on the ladder
[5:33:34] bulvar10: Let's be real the next balance patch coming is a sub rogue buff because pikacry has been calling it unplayable
[5:33:53] nikolaievitch1: BibleThump
[5:34:16] bestchaakbestjjang: like there is nothing healthy about being able to spam purge entire game. thats the entire reason other classes got nerfed
[5:34:24] Axl_Rose94: fire mage and frost also oom
[5:34:42] Movzee: how do you get your hots so big on the raid party frames?
[5:34:56] stljay73: @SebboTheFro okay, never play PvP, just watch AWC, turned on to cdews stream becuse it is coming up
[5:34:56] nikolaievitch1: it has a high skill cap
[5:34:57] Kanooog: @bulvar10 I doubt it, that happened before and he just played a ton of alts.
[5:34:58] itsangelbro: thats just arcane
[5:35:02] PeptoAbysmal: i don't understand the reasoning behind it
[5:35:07] SebboTheFro: @stljay73 Ah I see
[5:35:08] nikolaievitch1: thats why it has such small winrate %
[5:35:09] bestchaakbestjjang: i dont think some of these people realize how everyone was crying for nerfs on SP and Enhance purge for the entirety of SL
[5:35:44] SebboTheFro: @stljay73 alot of the AWC teams are so comfortable/good at their comps that unless the comp is bad they play outside the meta
[5:36:04] Kanooog: SP was Top Tier at the start of DF, took some massive nerfs... if Im not mistaken.
[5:36:07] memph1s: cdew u have 2 boys and 1 girl right
[5:36:29] memph1s: incoming future 3s team

[5:37:05] bestchaakbestjjang: no healer is at your mmr @cdewx
[5:37:14] kiefxd: ^^^^
[5:37:20] Kanooog: Run 2s with the some people in chat? I'm kinda new here not sure if you do that or not.
[5:37:24] Kanooog: some*
[5:37:36] dazuu_: i think alot of ppl were looking for changes in arena andd they went the opposite way from what people wanted
[5:37:48] seraph_wow: what about lock 2s
[5:37:48] bestchaakbestjjang: nighttime is when all the aussies and asian players play you need to wait like another 3 hours
[5:37:55] dazuu_: i widh you could get something in 2s  a mount something

[5:39:59] Reprimand1: How are locks in the new patch now cDREW
[5:40:01] Kanooog: I'm assuming Locks with the armor buffs are nearly impossible to kill as melee?

[5:41:27] bulvar10: Seems like aff locks are way better this week cause of stam buffs
[5:41:53] bestchaakbestjjang: i asked chan and he said aff locks are extra trashcan
[5:42:00] Stollpe: good fight
[5:42:04] bestchaakbestjjang: maybe he just hates aff
[5:42:26] bestchaakbestjjang: is the fear change affecting all fears like dk blind too?

[5:43:09] Kanooog: Ahh forgot about the root change too
[5:43:11] jacob_the_mage: this season feels kind of bad
[5:43:16] JerryBuckx: the sham armor change is like...what???
[5:43:25] SebboTheFro: @bulvar10 Nah no way, just look at him in wrath

[5:43:55] spacemanwx: good practice for sure
[5:44:12] DouzySham: are Trill, Mes, and Sam also full time on team liquid or do they have other jobs?

[5:45:22] bulvar10: Those armor changes are disappointing for my hpala
[5:45:37] buffevoker: Outlaw seems sick  atm
[5:45:42] bestchaakbestjjang: they shouldve just buffed SP survivability instead of buffing all cloth. why did mages need armor buffs?
[5:45:52] jacob_the_mage: Is frost mage bad ?
[5:46:07] bulvar10: It's def nice that you don't just auto lose to hunters as mage
[5:46:25] bulvar10: Healing a mage on my team VS hunters was just hopeless feeling
[5:46:25] xinzutv: @bestchaakbestjjang mages get one shot by hunters
[5:46:28] bestchaakbestjjang: wasnt fire squishy issue because of just having to run the pvp talent that reduces hp?

[5:47:22] jacob_the_mage: frost mage thoughts Cdew?

[5:50:22] bestchaakbestjjang: @cdewx , it is impossible for you to lose against that lock. Sorceress is that aff lock you hate with a passion

[5:51:12] kaounallah: just press dispel
[5:51:16] Shablagoosh: I think pika is practicing outlaw he still doesn‚Äôt know the damage rotation to the max yet I think he said

[6:03:51] Knaxxis: weird man
[6:04:01] renghost22: The second time you had two UAs on you, I'm wondering if because the damage was enough to actually kill you instead of taking you low that was the difference.

[6:05:38] Knaxxis: problem with macro?
[6:05:41] orangechrome5: sometimes when mr. blizzard sees you having fun he just makes a hotfix to ruin it
[6:05:45] bestchaakbestjjang: well everyone knows how to beat you now in awc when you play pres. double aff Kappa

[6:06:21] bulvar10: Ua*
[6:06:23] yeah_buddy: sounds like latency
[6:06:24] protatoparv: There‚Äôs a great video online explaining spell Que windows. Basically if your window is set too low it‚Äôll be inconsistent
[6:06:27] Knaxxis: just a weird interaction i guess idk - sorry its frustrating
[6:06:33] protatoparv: Maybe but tho :0
[6:06:35] WardenDOTA: spell q wouldnt affect that
[6:06:36] protatoparv: Bug*
[6:06:38] ShaHugs: how do you change queue window

[6:06:51] remmixx: @bulvar10 this might be it @cdewx  what if they are reapplying UA at the time yo uare dispelling or smth ?
[6:07:01] bit0x: @memph1s you cannot dispel UA with fade anymore without taking dmg
[6:07:03] lustevit: could it be that the gravity of the moon shifted the latency?
[6:07:05] WardenDOTA: definitely didnt reapply 3 uas the instant he dispelled them
[6:07:18] Knaxxis: yeha i tried to fade a dispell ua and just died the other day lol
[6:07:22] Knaxxis: coming from shadowlands
[6:07:28] memph1s: I know it sometimes doesnt work, even I press fade and buff on my screen
[6:07:31] remmixx: @WardenDOTA  it's enough to apply one to get him silenced
[6:07:37] Knaxxis: found that out quick lol
[6:07:43] WardenDOTA: yea but he ate 2-3 of them every time
[6:07:55] Knaxxis: i miss greater fade :(
[6:07:59] memph1s: not talking about dispell, but other spells, sometimes go off while i have fade buff, must be latency
[6:08:02] THEURBANSPECTACLE: PopNemo PopNemo PopNemo PopNemo
[6:08:04] Gushingcoom: blizzard debuff
[6:08:07] THEURBANSPECTACLE: DinoDance DinoDance DinoDance
[6:08:11] bestchaakbestjjang: @cdewx , it did work last season
[6:08:11] relaywow: Queue vs yourself
[6:08:22] bestchaakbestjjang: if you macroed fade with md it worked
[6:08:24] Knaxxis: season 3 hpriest first heealer i ever played and it kinda spoiled me
[6:08:29] lustevit: wait what? you can‚Äôt fade dispell? i swear you could, you just couldn‚Äôt fade mass dispell
[6:08:31] yeah_buddy: Seems to just be you need to time it precisely so a deems here or there latency probably fucked it.
[6:08:33] bulvar10: Yeah he knows fade dispel was nerfed in 10.2.0 patch notes boys
[6:08:33] Knaxxis: of slands
[6:08:45] WardenDOTA: it used to work, you used to be able to do it if you had enough haste, they specifically changed it
[6:08:47] memph1s: ye they changed fade
[6:08:49] lustevit: @bulvar10 ahhh
[6:08:49] WardenDOTA: it will hit through fade
[6:09:01] lustevit: i see

[6:09:22] WardenDOTA: no they just don't like circumventing dispel protection
[6:09:32] bulvar10: Lmao yeah that's sketchy as f
[6:09:43] Movzee: your talents weren‚Äôt applied those rounds idk if those affect it though
[6:09:43] bulvar10: It's like ok Ima dispel and hopefully I don't just instantly lose
[6:09:49] Knaxxis: better to happen now then in awc tho so i guess thats the good thing
[6:10:38] bulvar10: Is there a best time to use cauterizing wound VS DK?
[6:10:47] Knaxxis: oh no warlock in this SS
[6:10:48] WardenDOTA: the other lock was from barthilas, it's remotely possible its a ping thing
[6:10:48] bulvar10: Cauterizing flame or W.e
[6:10:53] Knaxxis: im surprised
[6:11:21] bulvar10: Could be because the lock you used it VS is from barthilas lol
[6:12:42] lustevit: are rdruid dead now?

[6:13:13] remmixx: every looby has an Rshaman. Are they super good right now ?
[6:13:20] Knaxxis: Rdruid will never be dead iot's literally blizzard's favorite healer
[6:13:27] Knaxxis: it'll always be meta
[6:13:30] vaykaylol: I usually press H and see it in the rated section but thats a good idea to add it beneath abilities.
[6:13:33] Cantbemilked: do we have to conquest buff now too ?
[6:13:35] yeah_buddy: could just have been 2 separate small lag spikes
[6:13:51] lustevit: curious to know how much that 5% nerf changed them
[6:13:59] Knaxxis: not at all
[6:14:08] bulvar10: What 5% nerf
[6:14:08] Moobot: Follow me! https://twitter.com/cdew_wow https://www.youtube.com/tenderloinx1
[6:14:18] bulvar10: The mana regen?
[6:14:20] lustevit: lol, yeah I gues 5% isn‚Äôt much
[6:14:28] Knaxxis: %5 is fan service
[6:14:31] Knaxxis: doesn nothing
[6:14:35] bulvar10: They also reduced mana costs of every ability for rdru
[6:15:00] Knaxxis: wasnt rdruid the best for all of shadownads and bfa as well?
[6:15:12] lustevit: @knaxxis
[6:15:16] lustevit: @knaxxis nah
[6:15:25] lustevit: pallys ruled end of BFA and Shadowlands
[6:15:44] lustevit: ineffable truth in BFA and just overall OP in shadowlands
[6:15:49] bulvar10: SL s1 pala was the "worst healer" until awc started, then every team used an hpal
[6:15:49] stljay73: @Knaxxis Shadowlands was RMP
[6:15:59] shugguls: sure it was priest in SL due to being cc immune
[6:16:05] Knaxxis: only season 3 of sslands was rmp
[6:16:18] Knaxxis: maybe s2 as well
[6:16:19] memph1s: pika and his totem awareness SeemsGood
[6:16:31] lustevit: @knaxxis def not true. S1 RMP was the most busted. combust would one shot you lol. same with mindgames
[6:16:47] Knaxxis: yeah true s1 was nuts
[6:16:53] bulvar10: Mind games was so busted for the first week of SL lmao
[6:17:15] bulvar10: 50% of people's hp as disc
[6:17:30] lustevit: and rdruid is thrives in slow meta‚Äôs. shadowlands was never really slow, so yeah, it was not good most of shadowlands
[6:17:43] mememories_tv: he did not heff de loahs blessing
[6:18:03] Knaxxis: idk its prolly caude im a rdruid hater
[6:18:08] Knaxxis: cause*
[6:18:09] deanoxs: @bulvar10 first week LOL
[6:18:18] stljay73: SL was when I loved double outlaw and priest, was funny
[6:18:27] bulvar10: Yea they nerfed it quick lol
[6:18:27] lustevit: @knaxxis fair lol. they were good most of WoW so it‚Äôs justified
[6:18:42] Knaxxis: yeah just sick of them and warlocks really

[6:23:23] Knaxxis: its funny how arena gets somewhat easier the higher rating u r because its more predictable - u never know what noobs r gonna do
[6:23:29] Knaxxis: bad take?
[6:23:44] Bombaclaet_Rogue: how is to play against pika? like is it annoying?

[6:26:39] wund4rbar_us: 5\6 win +6 Kappa PogChamp PogChamp
[6:26:40] remmixx: that is why I stopped playing retail.. not worth playing shuffle as a healer
[6:26:44] izza_cat: if only you wouldve went 6/0 for +8
[6:26:47] TanaWoW: higher starting cr + lower opponent mmr
[6:26:51] Kizren: 1.2 points per round win lol
[6:26:52] lustevit: this is what healers got when they asked for faster q‚Äôs. larger mmr gaps and therefore less points
[6:26:55] jacob_the_mage: 6/0 for a whopping +7
[6:26:58] LifeOfDanDotMe: because of the way dracthyr heals it just looks like you throw the whole positioning thing out the window. Accurate?
[6:27:08] shugguls: well if u went 6/0 u would have got 7, if u wen 4/2 u would have lost 1k
[6:27:21] jacob_the_mage: U gonna run bommy/rogue for tourney with recent armor changes to arcane?

[6:28:10] izza_cat: sounds dogshit
[6:28:12] WardenDOTA: i looked at the vod, the 3 times it worked in the first round 1) you had precog 2) no ua up 3) you had shroud up. Maybe if you can get silenced it doesn't work?
[6:28:13] izza_cat: ggs
[6:28:15] Knaxxis: when i was playing evoker s1 i was always afraid to verdant into melee
