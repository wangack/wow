[0:48:58] RolexKT: I know lots of people quitting over that dumb raid requirement
[0:49:00] mmrghost7: i did it in the morning eu time
[0:49:01] Sycogenesis: Ya, i mean rogue kind got fucked on runes in phase 1
[0:49:04] HaxzorJimDuggan: wouldnt be surprised if people start selling spots to clear trash for that item
[0:49:11] Sycogenesis: We don't really have any bangers
[0:49:18] abracka_: i've already seen two warlocks just afk'ing in meta form with all their glory in town on crusader strike
[0:49:33] mmrghost7: cuz first q was bugged
[0:49:34] REALPolarbeezy: I mean theres enough people in the guild we could probably do it
[0:49:42] mitchiislickgg: Did you see that obilisk that appeared and disappeared in someones game
[0:49:57] Sycogenesis: @REALPolarbeezy but are they geard is the question
[0:50:00] CardinalTX: As a warlock ill get it eventually but i never really plan to tank spec

[0:50:14] abracka_: damn it's DARK DARK in there KEKW
[0:50:27] wEiRdO_dUdE: That tower in Darkshore is a death trap, if I remember right
[0:50:49] Sycogenesis: He's not wrong
[0:51:27] Sycogenesis: Bro, the Whole thing is  super sweaty lol
[0:51:29] geokouts: Hello darkness my old friend :)

[0:51:48] wEiRdO_dUdE: They are not real great at DPS, which doesn't help
[0:51:49] Nevindaz: just do a HC Fryak on retail and you'll get it Kappa
[0:51:49] Br0lyp: hello, no vod from yesterday?
[0:52:00] Sycogenesis: They know its the only rune ppl want
[0:52:06] nitemare34godd: there is not vod
[0:52:07] REALPolarbeezy: You said it yesterday or the day before that theres no way they lock it behind the raid

[0:52:39] Eshel: not to get off topic... but I'd like to start this Monday by saying ... "Fucking Forty Niners Man !!!!"
[0:52:44] Eshel: and good morning all :)
[0:53:07] Pups_Gersky: Could possibly get a guild raid together and run you through it since you have to do dps first and you can get the rune before 25.
[0:53:30] Pups_Gersky: Unless you can't enter until 25.
[0:53:34] Pups_Gersky: I'm not sure.
[0:53:57] ijuki: that rune should have been level 14, just saying
[0:54:38] Pups_Gersky: Just lock it behind maybe running all dungeons.
[0:54:43] Moobot: Ask a moderator for permission before posting a link, @mitchiislickgg (warning)

[0:57:00] Eggspoached: @Sycogenesis No joke, I got a 1 day suspension for name violations on RP servers
[0:57:08] Sycogenesis: surprisesecks i wanted to make a funny rogue pvp name, i camped them for 3 hours in WC yesterday  butt hurt af lol
[0:57:28] Sycogenesis: i've killed 50 ppl so far
[0:57:28] abracka_: i mean that name would be against tos on non rp servers as well
[0:57:50] Sycogenesis: peepoPls
[0:57:56] ijuki: @pups_gersky I rather have locked behind 5 group quests that required 5 people
[0:58:27] wEiRdO_dUdE: That was strange
[0:58:36] CardinalTX: that was crazy
[0:58:42] tr4ncetv: How bout them college playoffs

[1:05:45] falldrgn: is a Rogue tank even viable?
[1:05:46] ijuki: Guess I go druid then… yay
[1:05:59] pikwi406: think they goofed up on Lock and Rogue tank runes for sure
[1:06:02] Affiiance: Whats the TLDR for Meta?
[1:06:18] jiffynuts: @towelliee same. sums up my feelings too
[1:06:22] abbosss: I just want to know why it's so much more ridiculously harder than the other runes
[1:06:37] Affiiance: Thats fucking retarded
[1:06:43] nevercluckyy: it wasnt even that its locked behind the raid it was that it was bugged until last night and they didnt do anything with it
[1:06:44] abracka_: enhance is super fun to tank with
[1:06:45] FusionKissMe: the items in fbd for the quest are near the end
[1:06:45] Zimmygee: Guess im alone in liking that everyone wont have meta? Its cool when unique things take real effort to get and not everyone has it.
[1:06:48] Wcvechten: COPIUM
[1:06:49] drunkieduckie: wtf that’s stupid
[1:06:51] RunningOn_E: I thought the point of SoD was to be OP... why is everything getting nerfed?
[1:06:54] wEiRdO_dUdE: Yeah people have been enjoy the shammy tanks
[1:06:54] nevercluckyy: the orbs werent dropping until last night
[1:06:59] nevercluckyy: so it was impossible to do
[1:06:59] abracka_: started up a 2nd account just to play my shaman on crusader strike
[1:07:10] soysos91: I was having fun watching the hunt for Meta
[1:07:17] nevercluckyy: the orb from SFK and BFD
[1:07:19] pikwi406: raid, it was hotfixed in lmao
[1:07:21] abbosss: How is rogue tank looking so far? Rune found yet or nah?
[1:07:27] SumZeroGG: Initial feeling about the corsair monitor?
[1:07:34] CardinalTX: Doing the raid isnt crazy hard but being the only one locked to the raid is kinda.......what?
[1:07:37] pikwi406: because the quest was meant for 5 man, so because BFD is now a raid, there was a buig
[1:07:41] FusionKissMe: I got the Soran'ruk Fragments last night in raid
[1:07:50] nevercluckyy: i really feel for the locks that completely raid already
[1:07:59] luchion09: morning dude
[1:08:26] nevercluckyy: 3
[1:08:34] FusionKissMe: yes multiple can
[1:08:38] Nebulizer87: it resets every three days no reason to feel bad
[1:08:45] Buttscratchrr: Hey Towelliee how about them colts!.... Coming from a Ravens fan LUL towOof
[1:08:46] FusionKissMe: I had 3 locks in my raid we all got them
[1:08:53] FusionKissMe: off the same mobs
[1:09:06] tydrennistv: what server are you playing on?
[1:09:33] zombie_snacks666: That is a feels bad moment
[1:09:36] jorax83: I was going to warlock tank but switching to shaman now
[1:09:42] BullDevil: you must crawl before you walk LUL
[1:09:48] byrdeen45: they were thinking fuck warlocks
[1:09:49] fakevaltteri: Oh Blizzard. One step forward, two steps back.
[1:09:49] tehrobtar: @Towelliee is this the new wow lofi music you've got playing?
[1:09:55] RolexKT: This rune being so heavily advertised only to come from such an awful source just feels like a spit in the face
[1:09:56] raldrik: At this point I just want to get to 25 and wait for the 2nd phase and hope SOD gets better. POE on Friday is going to get me through my week
[1:10:08] Sarocus: So warlock tanking will be more of a phase 2 thing. At least you are prepared

[1:10:15] abracka_: imagine they'd just add it to that new rep/vendor at that point
[1:10:24] HaxzorJimDuggan: maybe they add a vendor for some old runes
[1:10:41] crunchyFrog999: to be fair annoying obtuse crap like that is pretty on brand for classic Kappa
[1:10:45] Valseki: Any rune that requires multiple people might be tough to complete after next phase
[1:10:46] SuperLost89: i bet they fix it so you can get everything from right outside of the BFD raid
[1:10:48] FusionKissMe: When i found out i had to do BFD for the quest i almost switched, had to spend a few hours trying to pug BFD for it
[1:10:58] Calphurnious: Bring 10 warlocks
[1:11:02] HaxzorJimDuggan: bring them in for trash then tell them to gtfo

[1:11:23] REALPolarbeezy: Yeah gotta join it in settings
[1:11:25] Heyhowsitgoingtonight: How about the 49ers
[1:11:29] thecynicalshuffler: having to max out the 1st phase of the season just to play what you wanted to play at the beginning sucks..  i rerolled paladin
[1:11:31] SamuraiWillZ916: they shouldn’t have given warlocks tanking
[1:11:32] Kneckt: I leveled mage to 19 and switched to warlock last night already level 10 and enjoying it way more
[1:11:34] FusionKissMe: @HaxzorJimDuggan you have to make it to the last 2 bosses for the trash drop

[1:27:51] Galadeon: so dumb that the tank rune is locked behind a raid.
[1:28:02] abbosss: Why was it not dropping before yesterday tho. Surely there were level 25 warlocks thatvran BFD
[1:28:05] abbosss: That ran*
[1:28:13] mavericks312: they put meta in the raid?
[1:28:26] Clicklesly: The final part of the quest is in BFD
[1:28:29] bluetip84: @mavericks312 yup
[1:28:44] abbosss: Ooooh right the Barrens quest wtf
[1:28:46] mrwaddles22: it wasnt dropping in raid because they had it set to drop in dungeon but no one was running it as a dungeon
[1:28:49] Wcvechten: will you also try shaman tanking down the line?
[1:28:51] MoonwalkingAngel: sucks the way they did it
[1:28:58] mavericks312: terrible decision
[1:29:10] falldrgn: wtb updated class guides after changes :/

[1:29:33] Fugazi811: especially since you can't practice tanking
[1:29:34] PotbellyGoat: it's like the only reason I would play Warlock, but not worth that effort lol
[1:29:35] TheCyberGhost79: yea alot of my friends who went lock tank are furious about the meta ruin
[1:29:38] abbosss: At least there's a pretty fun shadowbolt volley build for dps @towelliee master channeler+ volley rune. Spam volley, keep life drain up and Spam life tap when out of mana 😭
[1:29:41] cyrex172: rage delete the lock lol
[1:29:42] Laelas_sm: yeah i have no issue with the warlock rune being behind the raid other than no other classes have a rune like that
[1:29:47] 1doki: !server
[1:29:47] Moobot: @1doki Towelliee is playing on Wild Growth server for World of Warcaft: Season of Discovery |
[1:29:47] drax1957: Is there still openings in guild and how to join?
[1:29:52] mavericks312: the most hype rune and you hide it ehind a raid
[1:29:54] Clicklesly: I assume they wanted to make it more like an epic endgame thing, but it's disappointing to see other classes get their new roles
[1:30:05] abbosss: It's the worst rune quest so far
[1:30:08] REALPolarbeezy: Cant even get into SFK runs, think theyre going to have room for Warlocks in BFD
[1:30:09] Noshpan: Yeah, even I am disappointed & I'm planning on playing Mage healer

[1:30:32] Ascentei: @Towelliee how do you think the rune placement is in terms of faction?
[1:30:47] Merkavore: cleanest UI I ever seen
[1:30:54] reyvin40: I planned on creating a warlock but not anymore
[1:31:03] gr1meeee: just joined stream, so warlock tanks are good? @Towelliee
[1:31:25] CrunkyBrewster: yeah that is insanely dumb on their part.
[1:31:28] TheCyberGhost79: and then they get into groups for BFD and get kicked when the group finds out they don't have meta ruin
[1:31:30] CrunkyBrewster: what an oversight
[1:31:32] pk99: then too many locks in one raid and not enough quest items KEKW'
[1:31:33] Merkavore: i was thinking about rolling a warlock today too
[1:31:37] REALPolarbeezy: selling rune runs coming to a server near you
[1:31:39] mavericks312: this maybe a hot take but then new tankrunes should have been easy to get
[1:31:44] DEATHCODE77: blizz goit some really out of touch people that fdont play their games lol
[1:31:47] wEiRdO_dUdE: Yeah they did the shaman tank rune well
[1:31:51] mrsn3sbittt: Its a good meme imo lol
[1:31:54] Ascentei: shaman earth shield is from the raid but not many care about it like that
[1:31:58] abracka_: my shaman basically already has everything to tank at level 12 lol
[1:32:00] Tramel0117: earth shield for shamans requires the raid
[1:32:00] RolexKT: Be different if it was something like the 10% crit one, but such a build defining one is wild
[1:32:01] SpoofAvatar: I totally guessed it was in BFD a few days ago, total Blizzard move, put the most sought after Rune in the raid
[1:32:01] Maruika: and find a new group
[1:32:02] Armdel: now that you cleared all content you can play like you want to
[1:32:02] Eitha: Warlock tank was the only reason I decided to play SoD, sad days for me.
[1:32:04] mavericks312: they should have made the tank runes the first ones those classes got
[1:32:09] drunkieduckie: that’s what I’m saying.  like not giving a healer a healing skill until molten core. what?
[1:32:14] cyrex172: silly blizzard
[1:32:17] CrunkyBrewster: either that or this is their way of thinking "keep it Classic"
[1:32:19] MoonwalkingAngel: ya no point in tanking so late endgame
[1:32:21] Wulfgrym: The big mistake here to me is making the raid part of the requirement, if they wanted to add a dungeon sure, but this makes it a pain have to be a dps then swap to tank
[1:32:26] ArcaneSyntax: Yeah shamans get their tank rune right after hitting crossroads.
[1:32:56] IlionDK: having the drops even outside the raid would have been better
[1:32:57] MoonwalkingAngel: sad we wil never see deadmins warlock tank

[1:33:02] Wulfgrym: you should have it at least by lvl 10.
[1:33:16] luchion09: off to work !!!
[1:33:20] luchion09: lol
[1:33:21] ArcaneSyntax: Shamans get dw at 10, tank rune at 12.
[1:33:24] TheEddieG: more work?
[1:33:35] AkuTVgg: yeah. was casually leveling a lock to dabble in the tank thing but now i’m not sure how much I want to even play SoD anymore
[1:33:43] Adfecto: sucks that we can’t tank WC or VC while it’s level relevant too. that’s a missed experience.
[1:33:44] Laelas_sm: worst part is in future level brackets for SOD youll still need a group to get that rune so youll have to get a group for a low level raid
[1:33:45] CrunkyBrewster: is there a layer hopping addon?
[1:33:47] Technogre: I mean I understand the frustration.. but it's literally lvl 25 there is so much content left after that
[1:34:06] Deekan33: what is the addon for layer info?
[1:34:08] CrunkyBrewster: ah okay thank you
[1:34:16] Deekan33: thanks
[1:34:48] MoonwalkingAngel: i saw warlock tank pvp they wreck
[1:35:12] Sycogenesis: @Technogre the point is it should be a early rune
[1:35:13] abracka_: we're in p1 for 4-5ish more weeks, why lock that behind such a dumb requirement
[1:35:16] mavericks312: wanted to tank as a lock now that i have to level to 25 and do the raid i am not gonna play SoD
[1:35:16] Heero_Effect: morning everyone
[1:35:22] Wulfgrym: disagree @Technogre it should be earlier so they can g ear up as a tank
[1:35:27] Wulfgrym: 12
[1:35:28] abracka_: 11 12 lkol
[1:35:29] CardinalTX: SoD going so well.....this was a fumble
[1:35:29] Ascentei: 10
[1:35:30] falldrgn: I suspect that they will change that
[1:35:31] ArcaneSyntax: 12
[1:35:37] Clicklesly: @Technogre But it also means it's tougher to get later, like if you make a lock in phase 3 and you have to get people to run BFD for you
[1:35:39] MoonwalkingAngel: typical blizz suckinf the fun outa everything
[1:35:44] MisterZerious: I got my shaman stuff around 11 or 12?
[1:35:48] Thewunk: wait wait. So you have to do the raid as a warlock to get the Rune???!!
[1:35:48] BullDevil: I had all 3 essential shaman tank runes by 12
[1:35:49] Ascentei: rogue is rep locked i think
[1:35:57] Tramel0117: rogues is rep gated
[1:35:58] drunkieduckie: warriors get their heal as soon as they have money to buy first aid
[1:35:58] pruteee: Yea but divine storm you cant do it lvl 20 you need 25 to
[1:35:59] stormanigans: Why not give lock  a two step style  tanking like the druid bear form and dire bear form
[1:35:59] Wulfgrym: yep, should be around lvl 10 like everyone else
[1:36:00] abracka_: just because it looks cool, does not mean it should be gated so heavily
[1:36:04] CardinalTX: yes wunk
[1:36:06] Fugazi811: shamans level 12 i think
[1:36:12] abracka_: rogues ain't tanking until 45-60 KEKW
[1:36:13] Gibsonex937: they should of had it before they can do deadmines/rfc
[1:36:25] terpzz07: runes are rep locked and activity locked?
[1:36:32] ArcaneSyntax: Tbh rogues have to rep grind for theirs
[1:36:36] mavericks312: they dont realize how many ppl wont play SoD now cause of that decision
[1:36:37] Wulfgrym: isn't warlock tank gear also different stats than dps warlocks, so you gear up for a spec you never going to use after you get tank, stupid
[1:36:41] Technogre: Yeah I understand where you guys are coming from
[1:36:47] MisterZerious: It should be a fair playing field for every class.
[1:37:00] Fugazi811: yea you can't put up a meta picture at blizzcon and not expect people to want it at 25
[1:37:03] ravenwingz0405: Your 100% correct, there is no need for it to be behind a raid wall
[1:37:05] Reaghol: @Towelliee did you need crispy spider meat?
[1:37:08] Ascentei: ok were talking about just the tank runes got it
[1:37:13] nuuenergy: Shamans early made it so both factions had 3 tanks early. Lock at best should have been locked with rep like rogue
[1:37:35] Reaghol: sent 3

[1:37:37] NobodybetterPat: mornin yall
[1:37:53] Wulfgrym: now warlocks have to dps to get a tank rune, to swap and regear to tank at  lvl 25 lol what a stupid decision
[1:38:12] Wcvechten: if other runes were gated like that I'd say, sure, but just that one is dumb
[1:38:15] Stormrazer78: where is tanklock meta founded?
[1:38:18] Sycogenesis: The way i look at it the rune might as well be phase 2
[1:38:22] DarthWrex: @Towelliee  what decision?
[1:38:23] MattyNiceTV: i mean it was the first spec they talked about when they announced it
[1:38:27] Amarlian: if they wanted to put it in a dungeon, it should have been the first available one
[1:38:30] DarthWrex: I just got on
[1:38:33] Wulfgrym: could see it as a detractor to players who only wanted to try warlock tanking
[1:38:36] Fawcheddar: when I found out the rogue one was locked behind rep and gold I stopped playing SOD lol
[1:38:44] Clicklesly: I mean, my warlock hit 20 yesterday, and not even sure i'll play to cap now
[1:38:52] zombie_snacks666: Yeah I was gonna end up lock tanking but now I think I'll just stay dps on my lock and maybe try rogue tanking
[1:38:53] Brodih_: @DarthWrex lock tank rune being in a raid
[1:38:54] spamdizel: what server?
[1:38:57] Clicklesly: And i wasn't even that dedicated to tanking
[1:39:02] Buttscratchrr: did u reload ui maybe
[1:39:59] DarthWrex: @Brodih_ oh dang, it's been found?!  yeah, I understand
[1:40:06] Wulfgrym: more i think about it, this should of been lvl 10 plain and simple
[1:40:22] smooch447: @zombie_snacks666 rogue tanking is locked behind rep grind and 4.5g though ^^
[1:40:26] Fawcheddar: @zombie_snacks666 unlocking the rogue one is worse imo - rep locked

[1:41:19] MoonwalkingAngel: why does blizz not allow fun 🤔
[1:41:21] stormanigans: normally it is every  class gets there role  abilties around the same  level   not this work  twice as long to get half the reward.  Lock dps may have to re pre BiS to tank a raid  which makes no sense
[1:41:26] Buttscratchrr: we all knew.... since launch went half way smooth.... and everything has been pretty solid in sod I am loving it!!! Best time I ever had in wow! since 2006 anyways....

[1:58:39] Molvonos: Like, 60 silver a turn in.  I went from 7 gold to 17 in a hot minute
[1:58:47] cjshred: I wouldn't mess around with questing after 25 unless they are lower level quests.
[1:58:58] deanbeo: Nice
[1:59:01] tereit: had 8g when I hit 25, turned in all the stuff in my logs and some followups and was at 25g like an hour later
[1:59:02] falldrgn: do the quests stop at  25 or just give bonus gold?
[1:59:05] raldrik: is that the play? I feel like if you burn all your 25-28 quests leveling phase 2 will suck.
[1:59:06] cyrex172: how much gold can u get from doing that?

[2:23:34] PaddyWicks: why didnt they release one SOD HC server?

[2:24:00] Buttscratchrr: Leave sod as is!
[2:24:06] Wcvechten: depending on how popular it is, I could definitely see them combine it in the far future
[2:24:07] Virelo: they need to milk the sod normal first
[2:24:10] NickLeonhearth: @PaddyWicks just delete if you die Kappa
[2:24:13] falldrgn: whats next? Hardcore hardcore?

[2:25:37] beatdownnlftw: @PaddyWicks idk the explosion of players and viewers makes it seemed like they havent missed anything
[2:25:37] Virelo: u dont get max sub lenght that way

[2:41:02] Nerendis: How hard are shaman tank runes?
[2:41:05] Jarless: all runes should be aquired by lvl 15
[2:41:07] Calphurnious: Is it just that OP they decided to put in in a raid?
[2:41:32] TexRex_86: I think its fine to have a long quest line for a rune, but agree that locking part of it behind a raid doesnt feel right
[2:41:40] Adfecto: I wanted to warlock tank wailing caverns and deadmines
[2:41:41] SweatyUrry: so me and some random locks got together to do last part of mete rune. 4 locks 1 mage/hlz.  we though we would have to take turns, but; 3 of them kept their drain soul on and all got the quest pop. i stopped so i didnt steal and missed out, (they ran it again for me) I would like to see a raid size party try it. also got the part after 4th boss and we wiped so got out with quest done.

[3:38:36] Aidler: warlocks out of tanking so far naguuraFBM
[3:38:36] Fugazi811: @hdvision0803 requires level 25 dungeon and raid quest items to obtain
[3:38:45] CausticNibble: What realm are you on?
[3:38:52] AnimalCrackers_19: I don't get it can't warlock use the pet to tank until they unlock meta?

[3:41:08] Colt_Engineer: Kappa
[3:41:11] 3663Sharad: People just assumed Wl can tank early on. Blizzard never denied that, but people had false hopes imo
[3:41:17] Mecabeast: Stranglehold death run to booty bay
[3:41:17] Ragi_Fz: swimming to booty bay and taking the boat unlocks it for future trips
[3:41:25] magenof: you got meta? Nice
[3:41:27] Alaquane: can you get summoned into the raid underlevled?
[3:41:46] Nerendis: @Alaquane You cna't get summoned into any instance
[3:41:49] blooodraine: did you do classic raid yet @Towelliee ?
[3:41:52] bdutton90: cant get summoned into instances in classic
[3:41:53] Amarlian: basically yes, there a bunch of good skills to train at 22 Lock right now @Towelliee
[3:41:57] Aidler: someone in Blizz thought “everyone and their grandmother makes a warlock in SoD. let’s make it really interesting for them to discover the tanking rune.” LUL
[3:42:10] FusionKissMe: cant summon inside
[3:42:10] Nerendis: It's not possible
[3:42:13] magenof: so where was Meta hiding?
[3:42:14] FusionKissMe: have to summon outside
[3:42:17] bad_fish_too: Cant summon  in raid or dung in classic.
[3:42:17] dualz6045: Can't summon into the raid. Have to run outside to do it :(
[3:42:54] Ragi_Fz: @Aidler the only classes I see kinda rarely are warriors and druids
[3:43:04] Rickbamfion: that fucking bag space
[3:43:12] Colt_Engineer: I can’t believe they’re still together after all the shit they’ve been through

[3:43:43] Virelo: i kinda like the 10% crit on chest with cb build
[3:43:51] Aidler: @ragi_fz yeah, warrior apparently really sucks in SoD
[3:44:08] Nerendis: It's like a quest line
[3:44:08] aspiration89: Yeah
[3:44:11] Nerendis: Much like the runes
[3:44:18] FutileDiploma: @towelliee you enjoying SoD I haven’t been able to get into it. it hasn’t grabbed me like classic and hardcore did
[3:44:26] ChanJustWon: @Towelliee you need 160 crafting for it from what I read on wowhead, and max is 150
[3:44:49] JiberishUI: where is the trading post??!?!
[3:44:58] JiberishUI: XD
[3:45:00] Nerendis: @ChanJustWon Why would they make level 25 gear locked behind level 30 rofl?
[3:45:37] ChanJustWon: @ChanJustWon it's locked behind level 26, in usual vanilla itd be level 20
[3:45:50] Nerendis: Yeah I need to do my december trading post but SODDD
[3:46:14] ChanJustWon: not sure why tho
[3:46:27] Kaykerrs: morning Towel and chat
[3:46:29] maccaruso: Eye of Kilrogg?
[3:46:34] Alaquane: exactly. eye of kilrogg is used for exploring
[3:46:37] Ragi_Fz: its the eye people used to powerfarm SM in classic
[3:46:38] Nerendis: @ChanJustWon That doesn't make sense
[3:47:17] Nerendis: No, all Epic gear is BOP
[3:47:22] nuuenergy: the epics cannot be sold
[3:47:24] Alaquane: bind on craft
[3:47:24] Nerendis: lol B O P
[3:47:30] nuuenergy: its a quest chain to make it as the profession
[3:47:33] Nerendis: My resto druid is tailoring, for instance
[3:48:04] Clicklesly: Maybe they should introduce Crafting Orders to Classic Kappa
[3:48:05] Nerendis: Do seal of wrynn at 25. My guildies said it was like 6 gold

[3:48:28] Mecabeast: Is it like the sylvannas band on the horde side?
[3:48:43] ClassicMalcontent: wtf is blizz thinking with that gold amount?
[3:48:45] Seamonster541: you get a lot of gold doing quests at max level
[3:49:09] Bernardo994: buy your own damn tabby
[3:49:16] Seamonster541: gold is easy to get at max level
[3:49:30] Seamonster541: each quest can give you 1.5 gold
[3:49:38] Nerendis: @ClassicMalcontent That's ALWAYS how it has worked. Xp is converted to gold at max level
[3:50:07] Bernardo994: speaking of which has the gold for each quest changed? Or the samne
[3:50:08] GilianoGVK: im on ur server but cant find people to the guild for invite
[3:50:19] Alaquane: ez throw is usable by everyone
[3:50:28] Mecabeast: Imagine doing all the quests at 25 then when level capped is upped your stuck without quests
[3:50:28] Manabucho: "Toys R ME!"
[3:50:59] warbringer159: you can spam RFK for exp in phase 2 lol
[3:51:01] Moobot: The Official Towelliee Hammer of the Archangel clothing collection is now available and in stock! Grab one before they are sold out @ https://towelliee.com/merch
[3:51:08] Manabucho: you dont quest to lvl, you spam dungeons
[3:51:09] Nerendis: @Mecabeast Just dungeon grind tbh
[3:51:11] ClassicMalcontent: @Nerendis so they adjusted the increased gold to match L25 as the temp cap?
[3:51:12] Rune_Phoenix77: I'm doing wetlands some nice rewards there 2

[3:51:37] Rune_Phoenix77: Wetlands
[3:51:52] zugzuggrug: We have no idea if season 2 will be a character reset
[3:51:56] Nerendis: @ClassicMalcontent It's just hard coded. Xp = gold, at some conversion rate when "cap" = true. 25 is the cap so the flag would go to true, therefore the conversion rate kicks in
[3:51:56] ClassicMalcontent: @Neredis I know max was more gold but thought L60 still 'true cap' with L25 soft-cap. So they boosted gold per quest at L25 now? For SoD I assume...
[3:51:59] Molvonos: its not
[3:52:04] zugzuggrug: Who is to say they won't do something similar to diablo
[3:52:08] Molvonos: Uh.
[3:52:18] Molvonos: They're raising the level cap, so they're not resetting
[3:52:19] Nerendis: @ClassicMalcontent I don't think it's boosted
[3:52:22] iamelcapitan: season 2 BC?
[3:52:23] ayehatethisgame: !discord
[3:52:41] zugzuggrug: Ya but they might character transfer us to classic

[4:33:48] mavericks312: kelenic is a bench piece for the braves if anything
[4:33:49] blakemac412: Braves will get him right
[4:33:53] NobodybetterPat: pitchers figured him out, it happens
[4:33:57] lithium364: mage healers with evocation later might be the best healers
[4:34:24] NobodybetterPat: they picked up eachothers slack lol
[4:34:29] polaropposite76: I'm assuming he'll be in a platoon with Grissom in left in Atl

[4:40:06] Stariot: Why not @Towelliee
[4:40:16] BubbaChubbs420: discover THIS
[4:40:19] NobodybetterPat: surely
[4:40:23] drunkieduckie: so dumb
[4:40:30] Nerendis: Honestly rogues are gated harder for their tanking rune
[4:40:30] PotbellyGoat: Blizzard is pretty good at shooting themself in the foot
[4:40:31] Fawcheddar: Change locks and rogues
[4:40:32] Snabido: Dps class discovering they aint that tank
[4:40:34] Bloodhaven08: rogues looking for boxes to get to honored
[4:40:34] Molvonos: I'd rather do the raid than the Rogue tank glyph rep grind, lol
[4:40:35] HAMMERRAZOR: morning towelliee and chat
[4:40:37] Bowwjack: @Towelliee Phil Spenser
[4:40:39] cyrex172: lol
[4:40:42] cyrex172: teabag blizzard tow
[4:40:48] SpoofAvatar: LUL
[4:40:55] BubbaChubbs420: honored
[4:40:56] Fawcheddar: Terrible
[4:41:00] BubbaChubbs420: which is shitty
[4:41:01] sprert: the repgrind is annoying
[4:41:02] Bloodhaven08: awful and its cost a ton
[4:41:09] DrSoosh: 69 years
[4:41:11] magemaster225: the crate rep
[4:41:11] Nerendis: Honored with the new Trading rep
[4:41:12] BubbaChubbs420: the trade one
[4:41:13] Nerendis: From the crates
[4:41:14] JPagan2323: depends on if you get the good supply crates or shit ones
[4:41:17] Nerendis: It would take HOURS
[4:41:17] MackPlays: I have to work harder than others BabyRage
[4:41:17] Fawcheddar: Supply crate rep I forgot the name
[4:41:20] Bloodhaven08: the one for turing in the supply boxes
[4:41:22] classicarch: the supply crate rep
[4:41:26] Molvonos: Honored, and a lot.  Sloot was doing it all yesterday.  Every single crate, basically, he'd fill out unless it was ungodly expensive.
[4:41:32] Nerendis: Azeroth Commerce Authority
[4:41:37] Ookagari_: the Supply crate rep
[4:41:41] Clicklesly: It's the same as Everlasting Affliction for locks ^^
[4:41:45] Fawcheddar: It's also expensive
[4:41:51] magemaster225: rogue tank isnt even good from what I hear
[4:41:57] polaropposite76: the cost for the rogue one has to be crazy to get to honored
[4:42:08] sprert: if they change the rep one they have to change it for every class
[4:42:18] sprert: because every class gets a rune at honored
[4:42:44] Dus7in: he's padding meters
[4:43:12] bumpstock75: It's locked because its OP. Staysafe already soloed a dungeon last night.
[4:43:24] MackPlays: Retail pulls in classic, already turning the game back into a speedrun
[4:43:46] DecayedmiNt: Classic was already speedrun

[4:44:04] fakevaltteri: I know why Towelliee is doing it, but it's so weird watching him DPS
[4:44:17] MackPlays: It’s way slower paced not a pull the whole dungeon and run
[4:44:22] MackPlays: Pls
[4:44:26] Raidr211: @Towelliee what do you think about some of the big names entering the transfer portal in NCAA
[4:44:30] Molvonos: @MackPlays Clearly not.
[4:44:33] chefdejour82: the real speed run is world buffs
[4:44:34] Bowwjack: @Towelliee 30 for ToGC
[4:44:38] N3llee: thats how wrath was orginally Kel'Thuzad died in 2 days
[4:44:44] MedicineMan: Why do people speed run classic? it kills the fun.
[4:44:47] PlatOnMyMain: MC was sooooooooo long
[4:44:47] CeruleanStar: 18 Hour speed run of all of SOD ... 12 days for 1 tier of retail ?
[4:44:53] Molvonos: @MedicineMan Opinion piece.
[4:45:03] MackPlays: @molvonos before discovery that’s my point
[4:45:04] drewetling: MC hi the deck
[4:45:05] Molvonos: Grinding througha dungeon for more than 45 minutes is not fun, lol

[4:45:21] mavericks312: why take your time with a 18 yr old base game lol
[4:45:26] MackPlays: It’s annoying running through and just aoe
[4:45:35] Molvonos: @MackPlays Your point was flawed.  It was speed run even back before, as someone who's been playing since Closed Beta.
[4:45:36] Clicklesly: Also cause most people have been through this multiple times by now
[4:45:41] notColt45: wdym speed running is the fun
[4:45:47] ididntdoitfr: Yea they ruined classic, I want to fight a level 6 boar for 10 minutes Kappa
[4:45:48] Molvonos: People don't wanna spend more time than is absolutely necessary.
[4:45:48] MackPlays: That’s all classic is, run and aoe
[4:45:53] MackPlays: Retail*

[4:46:45] MackPlays: We used to use them in classic before remakes
[4:46:50] Tigerbait26: the challenge of not dying pulling a bunch of stuff makes it great
[4:46:50] Molvonos: You sure are being wonderfully positive.
[4:47:08] Nerendis: @MackPlays No, we used to use them when we were bad in 2004 with shit internet. Rofl
[4:47:15] MrFrying: @MackPlays this is not regular classic

[4:54:43] ixiya_ink: yes I’m sure they will. give it a few weeks for PSA to add it to the system. there’s a new TCG I got into and it took 3 weeks from the promo launch to  PSA taking them
[4:55:13] alphabot357: They will grade them; you might just have to wait until it gets into PSA's system
[4:55:34] Gideon2826: Where is the tank rune?
[4:56:01] Alaquane: HypeLUL
[4:56:04] Molvonos: @Towelliee You might be able to sell the uncooked food parts on the AH for more money, given they're typically used as quest turnins for the recipies.
[4:56:27] Bernardo994: bring pizza and soda

[5:00:45] N3llee: @Towelliee see my tweet lastnight on the topic of PoE starter build?
[5:00:57] neftario105: @Towelliee ask him if he kill uber Lilith
[5:01:05] neftario105: I think not
[5:01:09] the1ulrik: how can you check?
[5:01:10] Alaquane: what's the layer addon?
[5:01:12] Bloodhaven08: how do you see layer number
[5:01:16] Kaykerrs: I dunno what layer I'm on lol

[5:02:18] sir_snarf: Have you tried out the Voice Over Addon?
[5:03:03] drewetling: need your imp
[5:03:13] drunkieduckie: I was in a heaven layer yesterday, huge group of people killing boars while I’d  skin, and then I got pulled into another layer
[5:03:24] Thunderbrew: Are there plays to add content to SOD or expansions or both?
[5:03:47] notColt45: There should be new runes at 40
[5:04:17] notColt45: It is
[5:04:56] ParfumAmerican: kara will be fun
[5:04:58] treeshark: This version helps people who get overwhelmed on retail imo where everyone boosts to max lvl
[5:05:01] cyrex172: i think if its popular enough blizzard could do it
[5:05:06] CeruleanStar: i think that end game dungeons/raids are likely but only a handful like 5 or less
[5:05:09] cyrex172: and it seems pretty damn popular
[5:05:28] bad_fish_too: Should get succubus. It does more damage than imp.
[5:05:33] Neowanderer: what addon tells you what layer you are in?
[5:05:54] theawesomestshow: i dont see a new xpac but i see an expanded idea on the concepts like bfd where they retune and change dungeons and raids for different challenges
[5:05:56] Thunderbrew: Addtional stories, and dungeons, maybe a new zone
[5:05:56] notColt45: expansion no but raids etc for sure
[5:06:01] Kaykerrs: Nova World Buffs @Neowanderer
[5:06:17] Neowanderer: @Kaykerrs ty :D
[5:06:25] PhoenixVirusTV: whats the xp addon you have?
[5:06:28] notColt45: Yeah I would think like down the line
[5:06:30] sir_snarf: I do have to admit, it has been fun getting drawn back in. I kinda like the artificial level cap - makes all of the 26-35 lev content feel like raid content
[5:06:33] HaxzorJimDuggan: i rather see them scale down the 40 man's to 10
[5:06:39] Kaykerrs: we tried lol
[5:06:43] cyrex172: i dont know if it would really invalidate it .... i think the two are different enough now,.. i just wanna be optimistic it would be so cool if they expanded on sod
[5:06:45] Moobot: The Official Towelliee Hammer of the Archangel clothing collection is now available and in stock! Grab one before they are sold out @ https://towelliee.com/merch
[5:06:52] trivotix: @HaxzorJimDuggan completely agree
[5:06:53] ZachsOnTilt: Do you think it would ridiculous to keep going with lvl 60 content that keeps scaling up even past Nax or is that too much dev time in your opinion
[5:06:56] Neowanderer: dead game lol
[5:07:06] N3llee: no such thing as dead layers in SoD
[5:07:11] the_bad_goat: it’s obviously a dead game
[5:07:12] notColt45: @HaxzorJimDuggan nah the 40 man is Classic. being able to carry 30 other ding dongs drunk off their ass LUL
[5:07:14] devilhawk83: I could see 10 man Scholomance and Stratholme coming back in SoD @towelliee
[5:07:15] CeruleanStar: lol just hang out and wait for repops ?
[5:07:29] aaryssian: servers are still packed. was crazy when i got online after work at like 1am PST
[5:07:46] cyrex172: honestly i think both could co exist. retail and a new vanilla
[5:08:05] HaxzorJimDuggan: @notColt45 worst part is you can never really spot them until naxx
[5:08:07] notColt45: They could just repurpose Kara to a 60 raid some how
[5:08:11] cyrex172: just shut down overwatch and free up resources for it
[5:08:32] drewetling: invite or let you die
[5:08:35] thekl0wn2: thekl0wn2 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 30 months, currently on a 6 month streak!

[5:10:13] cyrex172: EMBRACE THE FUTURE
[5:10:19] TheGiant99: Playing SOD makes me appreciate retail alot more.
[5:10:35] Thralazaar: playing sod made me realize retail is quite good
[5:10:42] Alaquane: chromie sent us back to the past so that we'll be more powerful in the future
[5:10:47] Dokeefe1986: They are packing the layers on purpose. They don't want people feeling like the game is dead already. It's a hard balance to strike. They posted on Twitter etc
[5:11:11] ConductiFlax: SoD is fun in its own way. Same for retail.
[5:11:26] drunkieduckie: rude
[5:11:33] drunkieduckie: I’m a warrior
[5:11:34] djfreezingcold: "i just wanna tag something" literally why i logged off SoD and haven't returned lol. some day.

[6:20:45] Amarlian: Someone unplugged the Null Modem Cable that connects the servers, it just happens
[6:20:46] OnceAMoose: Infractructure is likely server hardware
[6:20:46] aspiration89: It might not have been WoW specific infrastructure
[6:20:49] GorSTL: that's where someone issues a change that will have "no expected impact"
[6:20:49] Celicon: I think they really are moving the warlock rune

[6:22:06] 3663Sharad: @Towelliee I've found the Diablo figures on the German Amazon store, maybe thats a workaround?
[6:22:07] Sollice: @Fangy_Playz That wont matter lol
[6:22:07] igamingpublic: I guess, it's down for retail, sod and hardcore servers.
[6:22:09] garmin1987: thats what stopped me buying gamer advantage pushed the price over my budget was gutted

[6:22:33] T3mp3r: yup
[6:22:36] 91Niki: I have experienced that people don't know how to pay the VAT. So they get a letter in the mail and just junk it cuz they don't know what it is. Or don't understand how they have to pay it. So it just gets shipped back after X amount of days
[6:22:37] Sollice: NO ONE IS GOING TO COURT FOR SHIPPING
[6:22:41] Sollice: come on now

[6:24:11] FusionKissMe: @Jorud you win a laptop and wont pay the fee?
[6:24:11] Pups_Gersky: I'd force a credit card to place on hold and charge it.
[6:24:13] raldrik: Problem solved. Put my address as the return address and you dont have to see if it gets returned. Ill just take it and put it to good use.
[6:24:14] Nokterian: I pay my VAT
[6:24:15] falldrgn: @Utmost777 they may not have the $$ right then
[6:24:16] Alaquane: Towelclaus's naughty list

[6:24:39] zPurgee: @Towelliee You should do amazon wishlist purchases instead to avoid the shipping issues.
[6:24:40] robert_sigi: 4 Dollars is really nothing when it comes to tax/P&P. I sometimes order something from Texas, to the Netherlands, and then I'm paying 20 euro atleast. Depends on weight and the package dimensions, but ofcourse ...
[6:24:43] 07biby: towBook
[6:24:43] HellsDamnedUK: cant people pay you the vat before you asend it

[6:26:23] wowking35: holy shit du suck ns is good
[6:26:31] zPurgee: FSU def didnt get robbed. Losing your starting QB and a bad schedule while undefeted doesnt get you into college playoff
[6:26:31] chickdrummer88: I mean, I get it. FSU was undefeated but Bama has a more difficult schedule.
[6:26:32] Fangy_Playz: As a Miami fan i'm kinda glad they got robbed just saying >__>
[6:26:34] Sollice: @kingdaddy96 .....

[6:28:17] FatimusPrime: It was probably not supposed to be impacting production
[6:28:18] gelimarr: Guess I'll go study for  a bit
[6:28:18] kingdaddy96: @mavericks312 neither is the sec this year.  But bama was handed another gift. It's pure bs
[6:28:19] Zirist: Better now than tomorrow during raids!
[6:28:20] mavericks312: @polaropposite76 they lost to a top 5 team 2 times but FSU beat teams not even on the radar and wanna be in the playoffs
[6:28:21] Nokterian: Try to change hardware pushed wrong button Kappa
[6:28:22] nillsgamer1: Bobby need his yacht and forgot to pay the electric bill
[6:28:22] Mylamage: wrong day to be doing this blizzard!
[6:28:25] Sollice: OSU had a stronger strength of schedule than Texas and they arent in the top 4
[6:28:26] BirleED: I had a queue for a second
[6:28:27] zPurgee: There goes my rested XP for tomorrow lul
[6:28:27] Jynt334: Maybe they are doing some behind the scenes for Warbands stuff?
[6:28:30] Xenial70: who would you rather watch in the cfp? Alabama or FSU?
[6:28:31] BirleED: back to no servers
[6:28:33] AtomicScrotus: and it was this day that world of warcraft never came back online
[6:28:35] Sollice: and their only loss was to #1 Michigan
[6:28:36] Amarlian: What do you think if they added Blood Elves and Draenei to SoD but not BC right away. @Towelliee
[6:28:37] blindedbyscience83: I got boosted from WotLK in the middle of a heroic run. FML
[6:28:40] chickdrummer88: @Sollice Because fuck OSU KEKWDISCO
[6:28:42] mavericks312: @kingdaddy96 they got in solely for beating georgia
[6:28:45] Freeks417: @towelliee it’s issues with the authentication servers.
[6:28:52] Freeks417: there’s a banner on it.
[6:29:01] mavericks312: @Xenial70 bama

[6:29:29] Verdell263: @Sollice He's terribad. Good riddance
[6:29:30] chickdrummer88: Mans is smart to GTFO of that toxic environment
[6:29:32] Sollice: Everyone in Columbus has said that he was going to be the reason ( as QBs should be ) the reason we lost and now he's leaving
[6:29:35] mmrghost7: wl tank gearing is gonna be messed up need cloth gear with str and agi

[6:30:10] Sollice: Day may be gone he's play calling is too conservative
[6:30:10] Valseki: I think Classic+ is a new season every year or so
[6:30:11] EnigmacX: NA server sown also?
[6:30:14] Murlock07: I like it still its my favorite
[6:30:16] mavericks312: @chickdrummer88 mccord was the problem
[6:30:16] volkreig: Supposed to be raiding right now ah well
[6:30:17] zPurgee: WoW Classic or Retail? Which is better yall think? IM not a WoW player but getting into it.
[6:30:18] N3llee: People want what they want. And the people proved Blizz wrong time and time again when it comes to Classic.
[6:30:21] im_capy: Its because they hinted at "fresh" in the future in a recent interview
[6:30:22] XugieXugo: I will not be surprised if this rune system makes its way into retail.
[6:30:26] neftario105: Let me check Twitter
[6:30:32] Nokterian: towCopium towCopium
[6:30:33] blindedbyscience83: There's a name for things that don't change over time and refuse to revolve
[6:30:35] AtomicScrotus: does a subscription for classic count for retail??
[6:30:36] potatoezrgud: sorry guys this is my fault, it's my day off so of course the servers go down
[6:30:36] Thralazaar: is this not exactly what all those people asked for? new content and class changes?
[6:30:39] herzlustafir: atleast i got my dailys down
[6:30:41] blindedbyscience83: it's called 'dead'
[6:30:41] kingdaddy96: @mavericks312  yeah but they lost to Texas. That doesn't give them a 4 spot. Day at 4 beat a 14. But Texas @ 7 beat an 18 but had to stay in front of bama. Like what?
[6:30:45] mavericks312: @XugieXugo no shot
[6:30:46] erageK: @XugieXugo u on smoething ? gachiBASS

[6:30:51] the_general01: gg ID
[6:30:55] Ezekyler: it's a godd start, maybe the bad take is on the tank runes, but i hope Blizz learn and phase 2 improve more
[6:30:57] Verdell263: @Sollice Agree. If he goes, I wouldn't complain
[6:30:58] mavericks312: damn liquids minor league team got 4th nice
[6:31:02] konoko8: I STILL CANT BELEIVE THAT ONLY 4 GUILDS KILL MYTHIC FYRAKK
[6:31:03] TheGiant99: I wish SOD was even more different. Doing some of these very old quests are just UGHHHH!
[6:31:04] Sollice: Texas shouldn't be in the CFP
[6:31:08] BrokenBohdi: I wasn't sure I would like playing retail again, but I'm finding it kind of relaxing
