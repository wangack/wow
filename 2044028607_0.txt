[1:38:35] Lorrdzik: its not personal
[1:38:41] nastye: on mythic the necklace is a raid cooldown
[1:38:47] Lorrdzik: neck is a raid thing
[1:38:48] Taylor131313: ^
[1:39:02] nastye: puts down a little circle that raid needs to stand in
[1:39:02] Lorrdzik: it does aoe to get sanity back
[1:39:03] Taylor131313: you restore 25 sanity to everyone in a short range or something
[1:39:07] KaisenSiru: And its paramount people do mechanics to not lose sanity fast
[1:39:11] PneumaWHU: the people without cloaks do damage to us and lower our sanity
[1:39:20] PneumaWHU: and that's around half the raid
[1:39:23] Toiarc: What do you mean raid cooldown? its once in raid?

[5:22:23] heavyharmonies: @PieceOfPanic Yeah, I used to do that, but it stopped working every few weeks and I got tired of farking with workarounds.
[5:22:25] Voidbonx: when i watch staysafe i barely get ads, because from my location there is a low conversion rate probably
[5:22:27] JimmyBeardSlam: not flaunting the turbo icon or anything
[5:23:00] Dipsys: Is this like the soundless of dragonflight? I've not played since slands but Soundless was a brutal farm

[5:58:30] KawaXIV: I have a question about like 100% achievement farm cause I saw you completed that in a previous iteration of the game. Surely there are achievements for all difficulty levels of raid and high keys, and maybe hitting high pvp ranks, so you have to complete like mythic and high mythic+ keys and high rated pvp for this right? or do the devs separate collection content from raiding and pvp?
[5:58:35] OJ_Hype: essaying

[7:37:37] SskygamesS: special when im trying to dig spot doesnt open oh yes is amazing KEKW
[7:38:04] Basigouloum: i was watching some league LCK this morning and thank god the streamer would always play ads before the game start, so annoying otherwise

[8:44:27] Aegis_2566: @AnnieFuchsia on that fight everyone needs to be alive. If one person is dead during the group soak mechanic, Morchie will die which is a wipe
[8:44:32] Taylor131313: bis feet for pve tbh
[8:44:34] Aegis_2566: Or if one person misses the soak
[8:44:36] PneumaWHU: guild bank got some gold for completing the dungeon

[8:45:10] skibbatv: @nastye omE you think Aegis boosts?
[8:45:15] Sne4ky79: you got 2 chests to open next week now annie?
[8:45:20] g4nymedes: because if someone is dead, chromie dies (she taking dmg too) and without her is over
[8:45:21] modes1969: it has spirit...the dawn items have a third stat...like spirit or multistrike
[8:45:21] nastye: @skibbatv hes the one being boosted of course Kappa

[8:46:27] Selcatys: Wtf is spirit
[8:46:29] Vossie1990: These boots are made for walking
[8:46:33] Selcatys: since when is there spirit on it
[8:46:36] Farmoure: How are warlocks this season then?
[8:46:40] Taylor131313: this dungeon has flavor stats
[8:46:42] Taylor131313: like spirit
[8:46:43] modes1969: spirit still helps regen for casters
[8:46:45] Basigouloum: it's mana regen like in classic :)
[8:46:47] Elerments: this place has some loot with extra stats
[8:46:48] Mordotzz: classic is back baby EZ

[8:47:17] Taylor131313: yeah tell me about it xddDespair
[8:47:17] Selcatys: I've never ever saw spirit as a bonus stat thats weird

[8:47:31] Taylor131313: mine healed for 1.56 xdd
[8:47:38] gamamage: The axe has demonbane
[8:47:39] modes1969: its only in dawn dungeons currently...same with multistrike
[8:47:40] Taylor131313: otherwise last phase was unsurvivable without healer
[8:47:41] g4nymedes: warlocks in PvP are **** heals like healers, have HP like tank and dmg like DPS
[8:47:41] xxgeorge818x: do Murozonds Rise Annie
[8:47:41] KirtiN4K: :)

[9:07:07] szczvr: horrors turn into comedy once you watch it with friends
[9:07:08] kashynia: shining is a true classic
[9:07:08] CatatonicCataclysm: Annihilation is my favorite horror movie, think of the Thing but even more eldritch and alien
[9:07:11] Bloodmatch: House of dead 2
[9:07:11] Xaberx1337: didnt touch wow in years.
[9:07:12] progonitelj: why different background tho?
[9:07:12] Geoffku: if you saw the shining you would've got ziz's reference LUL
[9:07:13] eclypt_low: TRUE

[9:07:34] Vossie1990: Ye, they even asked if we wanted to leave and get a refund or something. but we were kinda excited about having this private theatre so we said hell no KEKW (movie was dead or alive btw some fighting game spinoff)
[9:07:37] Mordotzz: the shining was actually decent, coming from someone who dislikes horrors
[9:07:37] drzaius31: well it is old
[9:07:38] SoWizardAni: it's 1980
[9:07:40] bennet_r: that's agist
[9:07:40] nastye: @Basigouloum yeah its thriller, but i really liked the concept, just couldve gone on a while longer for me
[9:07:42] modes1969: shining is old
[9:07:45] Basigouloum: ye it's like 80s 90s
[9:07:46] kashynia: its very slow in parts

[9:08:29] Xaberx1337: saving horror movies for someone special.
[9:08:30] Meandria_Cyava: Ye, I can understand...
[9:08:33] fletch138: dont like gore
[9:08:33] Voidbonx: because of the vintage vibe?
[9:08:34] kashynia: last time I got motion sickness watching youtube
[9:08:35] Basigouloum: I actually enjoy more older horror movies because how it was filmed, now it's kinda always cliché
[9:08:35] Xaberx1337: hahaha.
[9:08:36] SoWizardAni: turn off any "smoothing" setting on your tv
[9:08:39] CatatonicCataclysm: not necessarily a horror movie but Godzilla Minus One is so good
[9:08:40] repelsteeltje88: i get motion sickness from VR T.T
[9:08:42] Vossie1990: Dude I have something like that too! But I kinda only have it when I see @Mirkooo on bereal
[9:08:48] Taylor131313: motion sickness PUKERS
[9:08:52] kashynia: yes VR is horrid
[9:08:59] Meandria_Cyava: 1st horror movie I ever saw was ' The fearless vampire hunters', when I was 7

[9:09:20] repelsteeltje88: they say you can get over it by just getting used to it.. so experience wise. but i dont buy it.
[9:09:21] Taylor131313: I remember you doing the VR climbing
[9:09:23] Cpt_Mad_Dog_GriFFeN: I have a story too. When in school, högstadiet, I bought alcoholic cider from a little store. I was like, 15. And then I smuggled it into the aulan which we would watch a movie. And then smuggled out the empty can :D

[9:09:58] WispGB: VR still feels like a gimmick to me
[9:09:58] Iste: Nah, I got sick using my VR at the start, but its completely gone now
[9:10:00] Voidbonx: back then they experimented a lot, nowadays all the formulas have been figured out
[9:10:01] Cpt_Mad_Dog_GriFFeN: 1st, I bought alcohol under age, and then drinking it in school LUL
[9:10:05] Basigouloum: tbh horror is the worst to watch a lot coz once you watch a ton of the genre you know where the horror is coming from and it ruins the enjoyment of watching the movie
[9:10:08] Geoffku: she's cured Pog
