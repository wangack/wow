[0:25:37] Zarjanda: Hype carries a lot of weight
[0:25:38] ddevillax: its harder to get alts and test out other classes runes
[0:25:38] Granademonster96: what do you think of warlocks????
[0:25:39] wyldeshock: maybe pple just want a break from wow
[0:25:40] Beastonian: Great Haircut!!!
[0:25:41] dankcheezits: Ozy ran a fun gnomer pug last night. Super cool to watch a team figure it out
[0:25:44] testiklees3: many ppl are still playing you just cant see them coz OF LAYERS!
[0:25:48] enigmasvea: more players are playing* hence more layers
[0:25:50] ipntheshower: I think a lot of people also got burnt out w how long P1 was. @Xaryu thoughts?
[0:25:53] thewayitg0es: TRU

[0:26:12] enigmasvea: OTK quit WoW as a whole
[0:26:14] mjNeeno: hardcore burnout too maybe
[0:26:15] bertubetcha: once people are clearing gnomer with pugs i think the barrier to entry will be a lot lower
[0:26:17] Fluiji: SSF not going to be successful if Blizzard doesnt do something abou the griefing
[0:26:22] SippinSimpSyrup: Honestly thank god they are not playing
[0:26:25] angelc843: People also just dont want to level grind, again.
[0:26:27] Zalien13: feel better play better
[0:26:29] Woozy985: servers are poppin off still. cant judge a game based off twitch
[0:26:29] quasarface: long hair makes my head feel dirty
[0:26:32] bigsugg11: “SHORT” hair. uhuhh
[0:26:36] Beastonian: @Xaryu the layering is different and so the world feels less populated.
[0:26:36] Granademonster96: what about warlocks?
[0:26:37] ddevillax: im not playing as much because its harder to get alts and test out the new runes
[0:26:38] Yahfz: whats SF
[0:26:42] cheddarluca: im shocked i am still going strong
[0:26:42] Mahca_: if people are checking logs for population gotta remember people aren’t raiding alts yet
[0:26:42] dabaddon: trying to copy pikaboo cut?
[0:26:44] The_Crane: They killed the hype by making phase 1 last nearly 3 months
[0:26:46] atzy12310: Not too short. It looks hella goood
[0:26:55] quasarface: COPIUM
[0:26:57] thebigdongerhere: Nah u copied
[0:27:00] llIusional: LUL
[0:27:03] jfive87: especially rav
[0:27:03] myboyluca: are you reacting to asmon's video about tinyviolin getting banned ?
[0:27:03] ipntheshower: Blizz may have scuffed themselves w the amount of releases and times
[0:27:04] ezentricks: bro you look 10 years younger with that cut, ggs
[0:27:04] SippinSimpSyrup: Ssf is just weird since they released hc official already
[0:27:05] Xammy0: I’ll be playing SF for sure and reviving <Goth Girls>!
[0:27:11] Valodore: Quest XP and Waylaid Supplies XP this phase sucks. It's way too slow to level that way
[0:27:13] jwillhue: all my bros got the same haircut
[0:27:14] Skilten: Xaryu lookin fresh with the Payokaboo cut
[0:27:16] Evolve_714: I no-lifed the first few days of SOD Phase 2 but I'm a rogue... so RIP

[0:27:23] Elijahszn5: Christmas it should've ended
[0:27:23] quasarface: should have been 2 weeks shorter
[0:27:23] Xammy0: SF makgora tourney HYPE
[0:27:23] Genghish: 1month and half
[0:27:24] LeeshDK: 3mo was fine
[0:27:25] Duckacubed: How many more game modes can they put in...it's a bit fatigued at this point
[0:27:27] calm_palm_tree: haven’t really noticed less players on crusader tbh
[0:27:27] ryan___mcg: it was literally 2 months chat lmfao
[0:27:28] bramicmar: such a boring argument by this point, it was fine
[0:27:28] wuuuhuui: nah it was good
[0:27:29] hejrafa: Phase 1 was great. barely reached 25
[0:27:30] LeBertTheTurtle: I loved it being 3 months I could take my time and enjoy it
[0:27:30] KosmicDevil_: i think it shouldve been 1 week shorter
[0:27:31] Nayr982: anything on the mitch drama?
[0:27:31] tsetse2fly: The phase 1 was EXACTLY 10 WEEKS - So 2 weeks more
[0:27:32] cheddarluca: 2 weeks earlier o so
[0:27:33] EnvironNA: Maybe 1 week shorted, I found it perfect. I play an hour or two a day tops
[0:27:33] Woozy985: Its season of discovery, they give you 3 months to try out all the new classes and give you time to see what you enjoy
[0:27:34] jjuliiuz: 2.5
[0:27:35] alexgoat94: 3 months is fine.. we got IRL stuff as well lol
[0:27:35] ryan___mcg: nov 30 - feb 8
[0:27:37] 1337nugget: they wanted to milk that extra sub
[0:27:39] llIusional: Yeah I coasted through P1 and it was so nice. 30 mins for raid and then do anything else
[0:27:41] KosmicDevil_: the last week was brutal
[0:27:41] PMA_1: im still level 25 kekw
[0:27:42] bertubetcha: i think that phase 1 was perfect for getting people to actually play. I played with friends who never would have caught up had it been a faster phase
[0:27:43] bellyguud: phase 1 > phase 2
[0:27:46] lucasthebestx: vanila zzzzzzzzz
[0:27:47] tsetse2fly: @Xaryu The phase 1 was EXACTLY 10 WEEKS - So it 2 weeks more
[0:27:48] makkybis: do you know if selfmode hardcore will be deployed with fresh server ?
[0:27:57] Dmayne513: who is this kid that took over xaryus stream dont look a day over 17
[0:27:59] lindardrel: agree 3 months is okay by me
[0:28:01] dabaddon: lmao great sport about it . that’s great!
[0:28:01] Benderover07: damn pikaboo's tan is fading, he needs to go get some sunshine
[0:28:01] ausely: whats sf?
[0:28:02] Mahca_: people got too used to alts and stuff and got burnt
[0:28:03] anthocouz: P2 > P1 Change my mind
[0:28:06] JayyyRS: my twitch was glitched and didnt show your webcam this whole time. you really did get a haircut and new shirt haha
[0:28:14] ipntheshower: I play Classic mostly for the PvP, so I've been having a blast in PvP once I've completed most of the other content
[0:28:17] 1337nugget: p2 needs to be better than p1
[0:28:19] daugonlol: as a dad that gets an hour or 2 a night to play I have loved both phases
[0:28:21] 1337nugget: and p3 better than p2 etc
[0:28:22] ipntheshower: PvP is the true end game of WoW
[0:28:23] The_Crane: I think Phase 2 is much better but the hype isn't nearly as high as phase 1
[0:28:31] Xammy0: the pvp experience in BGs is bad unfortunately, they can fix though
[0:28:33] ddevillax: im not playing as much because its harder to get alts and have fun with the new runes of other classes
[0:28:33] skrenz33: players like a melee focused meta more than casters
[0:28:35] jiggyspice: the pvp balance is straight up trash
[0:28:36] lindardrel: agree.
[0:28:36] tsetse2fly: @Xaryu  The phase 1 was EXACTLY 10 WEEKS - So it 2 weeks more
[0:28:37] Benderover07: since when did pikaboo grow a gotee?
[0:28:39] Quasarkin: This is the beginning of Classic+. Have patience.
[0:28:40] ArkanisRP: class balance is in the dumpster tho
[0:28:40] DiscoBaerDeluxe: for me phase 1 was better i tly dont like phase 2
[0:28:46] Jehl703: As a rogue main.. BFD > Gnomer
[0:28:48] cheddarluca: p2 less hype but it is for sure better content overall
[0:28:51] Tal_NeonFlame: Classes in PvP is so unbalanced and PvP is what people do in between
[0:28:58] horrorgirl77: phase 1 was only 2 months and 1 week...started end of November.
[0:28:58] Elijahszn5: /cry some more
[0:29:00] niall_9: chats delusional - SOD is not meant to be played 20 hours a week on 1 character. level an alt, play another game. balance isn’t in dumpster, most aren’t even 40 yet
[0:29:07] Titus20J: Classic has never been balanced
[0:29:09] Macehaed: balance was never a thing in classic anyway lol
[0:29:09] Xammy0: @tal_vastneon exactly, too bursty can’t heal anything
[0:29:10] alexgoat94: just got a fiery war axe drop
[0:29:11] Mahca_: PvP has never been balanced that just classic
[0:29:14] bertubetcha: people forget that vanilla wasnt balanced at all. warriors walking around with gressel one shotting you
[0:29:15] LeeshDK: ever changing meta is fun
[0:29:18] dabaddon: just go to helldivers
[0:29:20] Yeddamand: I'm suuuuper casual and am still afraid to run out of content in a couple of weeks. 6 weeks should be max.
[0:29:20] NightMunchies: new world is awesome game
[0:29:20] ausely: Can someone tell me what sf stands for?
[0:29:23] java_chaos: WoW is such a great game
[0:29:24] Phoenix3215: Ironforge is actually loaded with players rn
[0:29:25] MaskedDrake: nice haircut brother lookin fresh
[0:29:26] Fluiji: 1500 shadow ward death crits FTW
[0:29:27] ryan___mcg: @niall_9 you forget you’re talking to world of warcraft players LUL
[0:29:34] wreklol: the issue is that MMO's are a tough business. people that like MMO's buy into progression both personally and with content. they also have a tendency to speedrun. so in order for it to succeed, we need solid content more frequently
[0:29:44] ddevillax: its still strong
[0:29:48] Yeddamand: I don't think most casuals actually want to level alts either. Just focus on one character for a while then move on
[0:29:48] zo0meister: this phase should be 2 months, next phase 1 month and then endgame 3months +
[0:29:49] wyldeshock: i miss hardcore being big
[0:29:53] Niffah: Basically means you cant trade or use AH in hardcore mode
[0:29:53] tala____: Helldivers is broken atm, can't even play lmao

[0:30:23] ddevillax: i got a 1.5k SWD crit in wsg
[0:30:25] Titus20J: Nerf Arcane Surge first
[0:30:34] largist_: Gnomer is fun, but it is ROUGH to find grp as melee dps since bosses have so much armor and multiple boss mechanics favor casters/ranged
[0:30:37] jfive87: I found you during new world. you got me into wow
[0:30:39] daugonlol: what time is gnomer?

[1:01:49] Triber_9: is that actually cost or just money not made?
[1:02:15] fetza108: holy
[1:02:18] bigwilly3737: @kirk_hunts ice lance is INSANE!
[1:02:29] kirk_hunts: yeah Ice Lance is so underrated atm
[1:02:30] hearthledgerlol: Yea but twitch is getting a discount because they are buying in bulk. Its probably 1/10th of that cost.
[1:02:32] andypandynz: surely theres more to it than that
[1:02:43] kirk_hunts: I saw remmings do that last night and instantly changed runes
[1:02:43] thesunnyside: This is kind of a false equivilancy. Amazon owns twitch and if they charge this much amazon can use it as a loss for taxes @Xaryu
[1:02:47] WhudaFxUp: They run it on their own servers. These prices are beyond wrong btw.
[1:02:49] Kuja_: KEKW
[1:02:50] fetza108: if asmon shocks that is shocking

[1:03:02] andypandynz: wait asmongold taking something at face value damn who wouldve guessed LUL
[1:03:19] tsetse2fly: no subs
[1:03:20] WhudaFxUp: Just purely wrong.
[1:03:22] tuberculosislung: @andypandynz lol
[1:03:23] Nylox: Amazon owns twitch lol
[1:03:23] Kuja_: just literally losing money for twitch
[1:03:26] VerdenTheBleak: Ay, fuck em LOL
[1:03:27] Jaysmoke: you should be like asmon and not play ads
[1:03:29] kindaopmusic: but how much do they made with ads besides asmon
[1:03:32] ralphh1541: lmao
[1:03:35] VG_Ares: Bro Twitch gets 30% of his subsa
[1:03:36] Reaperz_kinetic: @whudafxup and how’s that?
[1:03:38] blazzedzz: FailFish FailFish CoolStoryBob
[1:03:39] fetza108: asmon is a millionare
[1:03:42] xChiip95: why doesn't he play ads or have a sub button?
[1:03:43] VerdenTheBleak: KEKW
[1:03:46] realmalfurionsr: the guy is the definition of a true gamer, he doesnt give af about anything except the game!
[1:03:48] taylorsdank: LMAOOO
[1:03:50] Reaperz_kinetic: @vg_ares he doesn’t have subs on his alt channel dude
[1:03:50] Meanpandah: bro
[1:03:51] fetza108: KEKL
[1:04:03] bigwilly3737: yo xaryu check that ice lance clip out shits underrated
[1:04:07] garzzyy: Lookin good today
[1:04:08] Slickk34: poor twitch
[1:04:09] RedSniper6: @realmalfurionsr dudes whole world now is everything but games. Its other peoples content
[1:04:09] kirk_hunts: Xar refresh reddit really quick
[1:04:12] naturalduck: NEW HAIR 💯
[1:04:14] Meanpandah: future asmon just roasted IRL asmon

[1:04:28] handovdoom666: how many people are doing what Asmon does though?
[1:04:29] realmalfurionsr: @RedSniper6 thats facts, formerly I should say
[1:04:30] doctor_anoos: oh no the multi B dollar company is losing money
[1:04:32] pnuka: they are losing money more likely due to manpower, like how twitter fired 80% of it's staff and is fine
[1:04:34] lilvirtus: whatever Jeff bezos is worth 150bill
[1:04:34] seancyx: Asmons got so much $$ in the bank. Hes saving it all to retire lol
[1:04:36] bigwilly3737: https://clips.twitch.tv/BumblingIncredulousOryxDoggo-0g5D-blcuZ1wBNSD check this ice lance clip out
[1:04:40] fetza108: last epoch is great?
[1:04:42] Reaperz_kinetic: @vg_ares what does that have to do with what I said 😂
[1:04:43] kindaopmusic: what if streamers had to pay monthly for using the site
[1:04:49] inhaledthc: the are making money from amaon tho so it evens out everybody forgets that
[1:04:55] petrosgambit: Last E- Pog

[1:05:27] AcidRain10890: Ayyyyy da haircut is here

[1:05:29] huss26_: Epoch is so good it's a shame this is the last one
[1:05:36] MagicalPurs3: Sounds like Illidan is going into the multiverse
[1:05:42] tuggy82: what a mess
[1:05:45] VG_Ares: Cheap Diablo POGGERS
[1:05:48] tsetse2fly: @Xaryu, It's a mix between Diablo and PoE
[1:05:50] petrosgambit: It's more intuitive than POE, but still really engaging
[1:05:53] tuna_sandw1ch: twitch is ec2
[1:05:54] Ddorn34: Is he saying it eee-pock on purpose?

[1:40:47] windatar: I also do a criminal background check.
[1:40:47] disfunctional: hiya @Xaryu as a fellow dad you should know where i'm coming from; i'm watching with my 9yo and i dont mind the language but can you step up the DPS.. not tryna raise a shitty gamer.
[1:40:47] JoeBangles_: @tinyviolin69 1
[1:40:48] bigld8848: big streamer like your self you should be screening people
[1:40:48] drfloppsi: Oh in the EU we have discussions about a similar regulation... Companies must ensure that ALL their suppliers and their ALL suppliers follow the international rules! XD
[1:40:48] mistahfrank: theres a weakaura backgroundchecker
[1:40:50] saiintzz: only playing with IRL Friends and i know they suck and are too dumb to cheat

[1:40:54] Thibbles12: I only work with criminals
[1:40:55] branny15: sometimes I have to check myself even. cant be too safe
[1:40:55] Wrestler: HC Elite doesn’t
[1:40:56] FMJuca: then why don’t you accept the gold from your chinese “viewers”
[1:40:57] disar27: agree with the arguments and yeah no negative intentions with it just wanted to raise and analyze the topic lol. some got a bit hyped
[1:40:57] Xottz: does icy veins speed up craft time too?
[1:40:58] naynayayx: this is why  i cant wait for 29feb no more streamers free gold finaly a fair server
[1:40:58] Tremble_UK: Is it not more fun to not take handouts.
[1:40:59] w1ldfrog: who plays with others in 2024?
[1:41:00] HelluvaWrecks: I look up the credit scores of the people i play with as well
[1:41:01] Elwine: checkin blacklists from the 80s
[1:41:02] ctrlbeesy: lmaooo
[1:41:02] nmitchell219: all 306g was brought by someone at one point. We all buy gold lets be real. we all old and have jobs and its alot funner to play when you dont need to farm
[1:41:04] Renriak: I've already ran 3 background checks on you just for watching @Xaryu
[1:41:05] andypandynz: @disfunctional lol
[1:41:05] vejitas4: @xaryu come to the dark side and reroll rogue brother
[1:41:07] KillzingerTV: I thought it was common knowledge to make a background check. HMM
[1:41:09] bigwilly3737: i have to kiss the person i play wow with
[1:41:09] bigsugg11: payo buys gold. nobody checks him…
[1:41:12] xXxBarlogxXx: does your guild not have a bg check form as soon as you join the discord?
[1:41:14] AYOW1LL: how do i use my twitch prime
[1:41:15] namesbuck: u have to go buy recipe which is in gnomer
[1:41:16] Nonprophetx: they have all vetted there 1600 arena partners
[1:41:17] blazzedzz: Could you say the same thing about catching a STD? LUL
[1:41:21] Shreddingly: Morally you should be able to take gifts from viewers. Practically, do you feel confident about the detection methods for gold buyers and GDKP when taking donations from strangers? There are enough claims about people getting warned for similar stuff to be doubtful?
[1:41:22] Getabluu: @Xaryu but LFG in retail is fine :Skull emoji:
[1:41:23] coolcoolcool777dood: HOW DO I USE MY TWITCH PRIME>??

[1:41:32] Diddly_dope: HOW MUCH
[1:41:32] ggbr0sky: yes he do
[1:41:34] bigsugg11: 1000%
[1:41:34] jay_deetv: chat I’m Xaryu’s personal background checker. please send me all your SS numbers and valid credit card info to prove you aren’t a gold seller
[1:41:35] BreaKingNaet: hi bro
[1:41:35] bongwaterfacewash: payo buts ddos
[1:41:38] Reaperz_kinetic: @diivergent dude huh? no he’s not is a direct response to what you said so long as you can read… no he’s not giving gold buyers advertisement that’s the lowest IQ take in a while
[1:41:38] antoinep11: payo is using la macvisa all the time
[1:41:39] taylorsdank: someone has the chance to post the funniest thing in reddit tomorrow. an actual background check for teammates.
[1:41:39] xNotorietyx: payo gets gold from ppl who buy gold
[1:41:40] hemsho: I buy gold with ETH pog
[1:41:41] andypandynz: payo did illegal stuff to staysafe, he def buys gold
[1:41:42] dramajohns: payo sells only
[1:41:42] AuntieXoXo: HOW MUCH payoOld
[1:41:43] Syzlak3: what is twitch prime?
[1:41:45] king___slender: Why would Payo buy gold when his viewers give him thousands
[1:41:48] marcusllee: HOW MUCH!! :)
[1:41:50] untamedfury10: Dont play with anyone who doesnt give social security number
[1:41:52] YRNrico69: I haven’t started sod yet, what’s so good about sp? @xaryu
[1:41:53] Dmayne513: wait but how do you donate?
[1:42:06] vejitas4: @xaryu yes he does buy gold he  is always loaded with gold in like 4 different accounts payo that is
[1:42:07] Vandracon: @untamedfury10 what if someone only has a social insecurity
[1:42:11] Skwidlegs: forward those gold buyer's mail to me, I'll report them myself.  I have an in depth process
[1:42:16] dovahtv_: no way Payo buys gold he already gives blizzard 200plus dollars a month between all his accounts KEKW
[1:42:23] julzvn: what’s the bag add on you use again ?
[1:42:24] syfttx: syfttx subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 7 months, currently on a 6 month streak! For Gnomeregan
[1:42:34] DatboyRush: ??? Lol
[1:42:35] Gunnan22: But why ban GDKP's because some people buy gold.  Same logic
[1:42:35] Cocaine_Loves_Ruben: payoHi payoHi payoHi payoHi
[1:42:36] LeeshDK: not the same thing XD
[1:42:36] ninetysix: stv
[1:42:36] Diivergent: @Reaperz_kinetic hes literally shouting out their names as gold sellings as he is opening them up, thats an AD. That is exactly what you do when you get a sponsor you announce their name on stream. Think about it
[1:42:38] biingb0ng: Please dont send gold to Tooclose on NA CS
[1:42:40] ggbr0sky: stv
[1:42:40] merrinator: STV
[1:42:40] Zoismoe: yes
[1:42:40] MaskedDrake: Or blizzard could ban gold buyers and people who break rules faster
[1:42:41] ScryerTV: yess
[1:42:41] KosmicDevil_: stv raptor
[1:42:43] Doolie27: STV
[1:42:43] bigwilly3737: @vejitas4 he plays the game 14 hours a day everyday lol he doesnt buy gold your slow
[1:42:45] abugslife: Gorgeous
[1:42:45] naynayayx: you have to agree that is frustrating for any player trying to be competitive to just see streamers getting free gold cmon... you are competitive urself
[1:42:47] ctrlbeesy: dude get the raptor
[1:42:47] zin_panda: Thats sick looking
[1:42:47] hot_souffle: ABSOLUTE NUTS

[1:43:00] Persianess: uh.....yea.....
[1:43:01] heygoditsme: do we saw the tiger?
[1:43:01] jeneraljelly: Now chad is mad as hell LMAO
[1:43:01] xTravvvvv: people just need to give it a break.. there has never been a time in wows history when gold buying/selling hasnt been a thing so what are people realistically hoping for?
[1:43:03] disar27: agree with the analysis, thats why i was saying before maybe ssf is the only way to stop it 100%
[1:43:03] Reaperz_kinetic: @diivergent you don’t know how gold selling works and it shows 😂😂 pls don’t speak if you don’t know what’s goin on
[1:43:04] fetza108: that mount is getting me dizzy lol
[1:43:07] orcuuh: background check that guy

[1:44:27] tsetse2fly: @Xaryu I told you yesterday to get 4.5k so you could go from 3>5 this week
[1:44:30] wikipedia_phd: the only questionable thing ive seen xaryu do is not disabling the mechrider sounds
[1:44:30] yellowgaiden: just get a premade
[1:44:30] Veyronn_00: Chat is it easy to farm bgs solo? Or is it still all premades
[1:44:33] coolcoolcool777dood: I sold a PoD on living flame alliance for 2600g , do you think i could have gotten more????

[1:44:43] spredenett: what runes and spec do u run for pvp
[1:44:44] spredenett: ?
[1:44:45] vejitas4: @bigwilly3737 beleive what you want report him once in the account here see what happens, if he is not then nothing will happen but if he does see what happens

[1:45:01] adam_brisbane: 49500 honor to be exact
[1:45:04] doctor_anoos: I sold a PoD on living flame alliance for 2600g , do you think i could have gotten more?
[1:45:05] feihTV: Xar, onlyfans when?
[1:45:06] pmanfit91: Wasn't 45k honor the calculated honor from R3 -> R5?
[1:45:07] caravainilla: @coolcoolcool777dood what???
[1:45:07] MitchJones: did u do raid with non pug last lockout. ?

[1:45:22] taylorsdank: @MitchJones <3 hope ur doing well mitchyjones
[1:45:24] Diivergent: @Reaperz_kinetic It making  people aware and think about buying gold. Announcing "gold selling" to the 5k people in the stream is only going to help them vs not saying it. I rest my case.
[1:45:26] im_a_rocketman_: @MitchJones yo <3
[1:45:26] coolcoolcool777dood: I sold a PoD on living flame alliance for 2600g , do you think i could have gotten more??!

[2:56:38] KazTheGiantslayer: Think lower rank spell have way lower chance to proc
[2:56:39] lassekk94: maybe its because its rank 1 frostbolts

[2:58:03] RealDecon: why not rune arcane blasts? low mana and 40% chance
[2:58:07] jallaballan: you need to hardcast in classic,  this isnt retail or wotlk
[2:58:11] camshreds: yep, scales bsaed on the data

[3:01:19] kookycorgi: "wipe these moonies" is especially funny because Moonies was the name of a cult
[3:01:21] FlySkeez: planning on trying to level up at least a caster or 2 with a melee or 2 that i like

[3:04:48] RastafarianDuck: i don't think its lower chance. 20% is less than u think
[3:04:52] grantgatz: try rank 2 lol
[3:04:56] Rindu: yeah just unlucky
[3:04:59] Thetacoeater007: maybe Casts/Minute causing the 20% to go down for you
[3:05:04] dovahtv_: i think they should take out pve in the event or make the mobs worth more coins thoughts???
[3:05:09] chr47: Going to boss is always worth it tbh

[3:06:51] 1kayefsea: that is just classic wow
[3:06:57] 1kayefsea: tooltips suck in classic
[3:07:01] chr47: @Xaryu tooltip also says "does x damage" which is completely wrong
[3:07:02] humledurr: 20% is 1 out 5 casts so its not too often it will proc anyways
[3:07:03] Froma2z: Use 100 times frost bold and count how many procs
[3:07:05] strakatak: do a few long casts?
[3:07:14] Gashunk1: brickosaurus
[3:07:18] HawaiianSpaceLasers: 1 int LUL
[3:07:25] Surruptitious: put on rune

[3:10:27] scoutbeans: it only bothers me because i have nothing that'll hit that hard that fast
[3:10:27] naturalduck: It's a long cast and boomies rely on crits
[3:10:28] Indomitablez: server lag/crashing for anyone else not in stv?
[3:10:30] naomgoat: its 1.5
[3:10:31] Slyratt: cuz it’s a cast lol
[3:10:32] phaydeaway: what about lava burst?
[3:10:34] ralphh1541: 1.5 cast time for SF with procs and talents
[3:10:35] NOHEARTs4: servers took a shit
[3:10:35] Teokin: except pom pyro
[3:10:36] DPTDave: my layer just crashed
[3:10:36] AbyssReborn: you mean shadow word death???
[3:10:37] geennaamnl1: Like arcane surge ?
[3:10:38] deltrexx: the rune plus natures grace can make it 1.5
[3:10:38] FueledGames: lagged tf out
[3:10:39] Doimos89: yea it seems more fair thank unstoppable damage
[3:10:39] Tropicocity: arcane surge doing 2800
[3:10:41] hiro25000: chaos bolt is 2.5
[3:10:42] 0kfatty: just like mage:P
[3:10:45] AbyssReborn: arcane surge?
[3:10:47] Vell_x: Death frustrates the living fuck out of me
[3:10:47] sticksaredrifting: arcane surge kekw

[3:10:53] Nimbus723: starfire was just buffed
[3:10:55] Knaxxis: how is shadow wire death now boys???
[3:10:58] SurrealAndre: arcane surge takes your entire mana bar, not a comparison
[3:10:59] Lord_Haz: is that a 10s cs wtf?
[3:11:03] KairuruTV: i really dont want anything 1-2 shotting in classic
[3:11:06] Dracconfoo: starfire is faster cast time now with the new runes
[3:11:11] acaciashrub: like a frostbolt icelance Kappa
[3:11:13] wprogress: @Xaryu Are you gonna try out Nightingale at any point? It released today :)
[3:11:14] voidtouched_93: Shadowmaw Panther trolling Madge
[3:11:16] Toopaid2freestyl: its supposed to be shadow word DEATH not slap on the wrist
[3:11:17] shaggzy: warrior cant hit anything ffor 2.5k unless its execute then theyre almost dead
[3:11:19] somebodyelse96: this pvp event is much better than the ashenvale one
[3:11:20] chardmn: sit noob
[3:11:26] dovahtv_: @Xaryu i deleted my lvl 40 and 30 alliance toons and went horde thoughts?? 󠀀

[3:11:41] bigwilly3737: these chickens wtf
[3:11:46] Craigumander: You look like 10 years younger my guy. Love the fade brotha @Xaryu o7
[3:11:50] hiro25000: @somebodyelse96 that's the best pvp event of all time
[3:11:54] lion_the_ryan: isnt frostbolt also 2.5 seconds
[3:11:54] FelQueen: SOD updates are so unstable and unprofessional... zero balance SeemsGood
[3:11:55] g0dzilla: so make arcane surge a 2sec cast and its fine?
[3:11:55] scoutbeans: @geennaamnl1 he already said it should be nerfed. but also it takes all a mage's mana and it's a 2min cd lol
[3:11:56] Lord_Haz: KEKW
[3:12:13] wrxbooosted: lol did you see the group of 20-30 dwarfs take over stv event the other day haha
[3:12:17] mortmos: @FelQueen QQ
[3:12:17] bigwilly3737: @hiro25000 ashenvale was boring after like 1 week lol
[3:12:18] SurrealAndre: @scoutbeans they don’t wanna think that far lol
[3:12:19] Knaxxis: anyone??? how is the need to shadow word death????
[3:12:26] Knaxxis: nerf
[3:12:29] bluesqusihy: @Xaryu why is this event made for groups? makes it so bad... no 1v1s
[3:12:31] huggable__: the debuff now gives movement speed?
[3:12:31] Thorthelord: hey xar, whats the best spec for aoe grinding sm lib?
[3:12:35] Philopinos: what about a 3 sec fireball then ? :s
[3:12:35] lion_the_ryan: imagine how fun it would be if it did hit that hard
[3:12:35] hiro25000: @bigwilly3737 I'm talking about stv
[3:12:41] BigggTanggg: what happens when you do the STV event in a raid group?
[3:12:44] geminuspr: Here it is
[3:12:47] DPTDave: RIPBOZO servers
[3:12:47] mufasoo: who are you and what did you do with @Xaryu 's hair
[3:12:50] geminuspr: Half of us got DCed
[3:12:51] acaman: i prefer people dying than being slowed
[3:12:53] g0dzilla: @Knaxxis for every priest player, obv bad... for everybody else, obv good...
[3:12:53] power_pcp: starfire is 3.5 sec
[3:12:54] Curtsy: @BigggTanggg you get no coins
[3:12:57] bigwilly3737: @hiro25000 oh yeah way better for sure
[3:13:09] Knaxxis: @g0dzilla so it’s not hitting no where near as hard?
[3:13:19] thewal1ofsleep: what is the point of this event?
[3:13:22] jallaballan: frost mages can also instantly kill people, but its with procs. Shatter combo with icelance is like 1300, almost 2k if you also proc brain freeze. But u need to hardcast in classic
[3:13:24] g0dzilla: @Knaxxis it got nerfed... so no...
[3:13:27] mortmos: @bluesqusihy there is no way to make a pvp event 1v1 in the open world. Any open world pvp events will be dominated by coordinated groups 100% of the time
[3:13:31] lion_the_ryan: i wouldn't mind having 1400 frostbolts, i might actually cast full ranks that way
[3:13:37] Curtsy: @thewal1ofsleep kill people get coins buy stuff with coins
[3:13:38] Knaxxis: @g0dzilla hell ya dude ty
[3:13:48] SuperLost89: @Xaryu did you know you can turn in 25 copper coins for 250 honor?
[3:13:50] Epixil: shoulda farmed near the boss
[3:13:50] AnimeThings87: from outside, this seems like retail a little
[3:13:53] gamerwatcher77: how is mage in pvp dont know what to lvl up next
[3:13:55] SaucyRMD: Where'd your hair go?!
[3:14:00] buchi_AUT: 10 more wsg rep and im done :D
[3:14:06] SlyToastFTW: A warrior killed you? This games busted
[3:14:07] mistamang: just got 1.1k the best ive ever done
[3:14:08] Curtsy: @AnimeThings87 Funny thing is retail time to kill is much longer than this
[3:14:09] TheNJV: what does the boss do?
[3:14:14] SticQeno: Aye Xar & homies
[3:14:16] beardmangs: you wont be able to ress at corpse, thats a bug
[3:14:18] Spruehfurz88: relog
[3:14:19] radassbadass69: @AnimeThings87 it is kind of like retail if retail rewards and open world still felt like something

[4:15:39] AtomGigantic: noooo you save more I think
[4:15:39] TiPauloDnD: your build is fine
[4:15:41] Rsantiago12: @xaryu I ran regen and mass regen in gnomer
[4:15:41] grantgatz: mass regen on clearcast?
[4:15:43] ImmaculateSausage: @Xaryu What are you using that shows ur missile barrage proc in middle of screen?
[4:15:47] bondaru07: @Xaryu yea but you heal all ppl
[4:15:48] Rsantiago12: not as bad as you thinkl
[4:15:49] caravainilla: What about surge for mana regen?
[4:15:52] AtomGigantic: damage in gnomer is aoe

[4:15:55] twobrat: Check healer parses?
[4:15:57] Schizodeluxe2: Try it on an early fight that doesn't matter
[4:15:57] smoggi_esh: Normal Regen is 360 mana for 1 person
[4:15:58] InsertYourseIf: @grantgatz Clearcast is only for damage
[4:16:03] NizzL: @ImmaculateSausage think its called spell activation overlay
[4:16:04] SurrealAndre: @AtomGigantic this is true
[4:16:04] Griff_666: Talents ?
[4:16:05] AtomGigantic: I’ll have to cast 4 normal regen to heal the group
[4:16:06] SophicEcho: Int over spell power?
[4:16:09] Rsantiago12: @xaryu you get a lot of clearcasting procs for AB
[4:16:10] chamineh: I did my first lockout as regen mage, used only mass regen and no oom
[4:16:12] SelockxSJB: @grantgatz clearcast only works on damage spells
[4:16:14] Loganlols: the only fights you need to worry about mana are last 2 fights, just feel it out and make a decision later
[4:16:18] AtomGigantic: who cares about living flame
[4:16:19] oprawindfurytv: 10 raiders from oprawindfurytv have joined! 
[4:16:20] SurrealAndre: or you play mass regen, chrono
[4:16:23] shadowstorm_sod: No feral?
[4:16:25] Argonisha: Take regular regen and spell power, then take chronostatic if its a heal heavy fight
[4:16:26] HoppsAlot: Cutest thing Kai's done recently?
[4:16:28] oprawindfurytv: WE BACK
[4:16:29] vSluis: opra windfury is a great name
[4:16:30] Sgt_TBag: if you're just healing main tank, regen is the way to go
[4:16:32] koreankracka: you should run spell power
[4:16:33] ImmaculateSausage: @ImmaculateSausage Nah spell action doesnt show it.,. I think its a WA that shows the icon like under the spell action thing but i wanna know what WA lol
[4:16:40] dalvasorsali: fair

[4:16:56] em312: ok
[4:16:57] mussletets420: are you using rewind time? i had to heal BFD as a mage once. rewind team was pretty cool
[4:16:59] AtomGigantic: @xaryu is this the build you talked about yesterday? can I see
[4:17:01] shadowstorm_sod: Bro three druid u should never be oom
[4:17:01] Tropicocity: 3 heals helps somuch on last boss
[4:17:04] Mr_NeonCloud: Xar chat wont let you play what you want. You have to play whats best all the time any time
[4:17:06] kookycorgi: are you running spell power then
[4:17:07] SurrealAndre: as a third healer then yeah youre good
[4:17:07] leetskeetskeet: how are yall logged in wtf
[4:17:09] VinnyDP: What spec should I go as mage?
[4:17:10] smoggi_esh: Do you play this with a heal druid and priest heal? Im asking because I'll go gnomer tomorrow @xaryu
[4:17:15] ImmaculateSausage: @Xaryu What are you using that shows ur missile barrage proc in middle of screen?
[4:17:15] oprawindfurytv: forever invisible
[4:17:17] ElephantSurfer: man i cant even log in
[4:17:18] AtomGigantic: @kroski tru he’s better mage than I am every day of the week
[4:17:18] HoppsAlot: Best movie of all time?
[4:17:18] grantgatz: that wand is cute lmao
[4:17:20] hdvision0803: What gear we going for? :) Been out of SOD loop due to work
[4:17:20] chamineh: if you are only off healing than I agree with you @Xaryu
[4:17:21] bondaru07: @Xaryu at least on last boss go group heal.
[4:17:22] crazbrelbeck: try to enter gnomer
[4:17:23] xTravvvvv: why not go full damage and just swap if needed?
[4:17:26] oldsanta100: This build worked the last run. You are fine @Xaryu. This is the most optimal. You helping the tank heal the last boss will be worth it.
[4:17:27] hennessy147: instances are down so gl on doing the raid!
[4:17:30] Griff_666: Could you show us your talents plsss
[4:17:30] BurtMan69: so you have a sprist too?
[4:17:33] stroobzbeats: still can't login
[4:17:33] sweaty_irl: just depends on the damage the raid takes. mass regen might be good for certain fights if necessary
[4:17:36] stroobzbeats: this game man
[4:17:38] BurtMan69: is anyone going to lose life lol
[4:17:40] leetskeetskeet: F
[4:17:40] mtgperry: Definitely don't raid heal as mage in this situation - those long fights really add up when mass regen costs twice as much and lasts half as long!
[4:17:43] asloff: well, retail is f'd too right now... sadge
[4:17:43] SurrealAndre: what a crit
[4:17:43] avo_9: If the boss dies faster you need less healing. Full DPS is the best healing spec
[4:17:44] ironwire: mass regen is kinda trolling here
[4:17:46] ShinyMatrex: @Xaryu Having a tank healer with a priest/druid is good. You wont need aoe heals WG and PoM(if they dont use homunculi) and circle should cover all the aoe
[4:17:50] cabo_chris: this is the gnomer I remember
[4:17:59] AtomGigantic: @xaryu did the build you wanted to showcase yesterday work out?
[4:18:01] caravainilla: LUL

[4:18:26] sweaty_irl: i think helping on just tankhealing is very big for priest and druid mana. they are efficient at groupheal and tankhealing helps them a lot already

[4:18:56] ShinyMatrex: @sweaty_irl priest CAN be super efficient at tank healing, they just have to choose that over aoe healing with circle.
[4:19:05] Perdonamo: lol run away angle
[4:19:08] TodBobertson: @Teem0time Good question, don't think so but might be wrong there.

[6:15:55] grkgemini94: if you go 5/5 in shatter and go glass cannon runes: burnout = 65% chance to crit against frozen target. so you freeze someone and then launch the surge at full mana. if someone is completely naked and it crits they probably die. On the other hand ive had priests absorb the entire 2min CD and all my mana with 1 PWS and I dont see people crying nerf PWS

[6:33:17] pancake_mike: add self damage
[6:33:18] Django_7: @Xaryu its a 2 min cd that depletes all of ur mana if it doesnt hit hard its useless
[6:33:18] alrajhio: add arcane barrage
[6:33:20] itsmedemolink: remove the mana regen
[6:33:20] Pixiepantss: maybe reduce the 300% lol
[6:33:20] Ayjayyy: nearly impossible to balance it for pvp and pve in this setting
[6:33:21] Maulo: AoE @Xaryu
[6:33:21] Zielepoot: lower hit rating
[6:33:21] ryuzakilightyagami: The nelf
[6:33:21] holycheese333: less mana less damage
[6:33:22] pickledplums: nerf surge dmg buff the % dmg increase from blast
[6:33:22] NizzL: 50% of your mana for the dmg
[6:33:23] flemantv: nerf it? have u played pvp lately, shamans lava burst do the exact same, 6sec cd btw / instant casts etc
[6:33:23] Almighty_kenzo: ive died at 8,18,13, and 7
[6:33:24] realandtruephobe: 30% straight damage reduction. It would still be a decent finisher in duels
[6:33:24] jallaballan: you make it increase mana by much much more
[6:33:25] RSN_Thicc_Dylf: a little longer cast time
[6:33:26] Klopernikus: no cd no mana half dmg
[6:33:26] aBradAbroad: should they nerf pom pyro too? its a 2min cd let it ride its classic @Xaryu
[6:33:28] SippinSimpSyrup: bro no
[6:33:29] edvano: no lmao
[6:33:31] nxdRn: make dmg dot so u can react
[6:33:32] CubicleGangster: Stop consuming AB stacks

[6:33:32] bondaru07: @Xaryu make it dot
[6:33:32] acaman: @xaryu  less dmg but 45sec cd
[6:33:33] naturalduck: Make it a 6 second cooldown Kappa
[6:33:33] akaYosher: no
[6:33:33] Aka_Gami: Is the entire reason to nerf it because of 1v1 duels?
[6:33:36] KonQel: maybe if it adds a dot - like u wand him for extra dmg or get mana back @Xaryu
[6:33:36] sending123: increase mana regen by another 300%
[6:33:36] dorkasteri: let me think….. yea, i got nothing!
[6:33:37] soyboywolk: You dont have to brainstorm anything... borrowed powers and azerite powers

[6:33:38] fretchen20: longer cooldown
[6:33:39] sushileafbeats: @Xaryu is it even valuable out in like STV event?
[6:33:39] lordsloths: cut the amount of mana it uses by a third and does a 1/3d of the damage its doing
[6:33:40] akaYosher: why would you balance around duels?
[6:33:42] Pokel1nK_: arcane surge should drain mana instead of dmg
[6:33:42] Kden1: i think its fair its a 2 minute cd that most classes get for free
[6:33:42] badillwwjoe: when is the best time to use mana shield ??
[6:33:43] foxwinkle: @Xaryu but arcane surge is for PVP
[6:33:44] Sillychops: just buff the mana regen so its more about the mana than dmg
[6:33:47] theelder1312: thats not a fix
[6:33:50] Webbyster_: @Xaryu to balance it you increase mana regen and duration of the mana regen after pressing the button
[6:33:50] RSN_Thicc_Dylf: make the cast time longer so you have to really commit to it
[6:33:51] Nandrolone11: @Xaryu make it a channel
[6:33:51] eroxs99: too much thinking nerf moonkin again
[6:33:52] theelder1312: thats just plain u cant play it
[6:33:52] Zoobeamer: ye less dmg and lower cd
[6:33:55] pyroflexin: @lordsloths I like this
[6:33:58] KazTheGiantslayer: Have it give you 2min debuff after being used
[6:33:58] CrayonSandwich: Servers back to normal?
[6:34:01] theelder1312: and besides there are more shit skills to be nerfed
[6:34:01] GallowayOW: nerf hunters and boomies is the solution
[6:34:02] Ervill1: 1 day cool down :)
[6:34:04] poofyy91: Bro did u see pvp tier lists in yourtube? so bad ;D
[6:34:05] Truthseeker96: how about removing it so we dont gotta balance around it
[6:34:06] morfius09: make it into completely different ability
[6:34:06] Hecticzx: Doing that to Warsong FC's would be pretttttty funnnn
[6:34:09] soyboywolk: everythings changing... b/c mage rotation in retail is garbage
[6:34:09] adam_brisbane: make it only use half your mana for half the effect but have half the cooldown
[6:34:17] SippinSimpSyrup: the dev team should choose the runes a little more wisely
[6:34:21] rsjcjones: have it apply the coward debuff from HC

[7:19:36] Jayceza: Are you entering?
[7:19:36] brahmanes97: mages are squishy asf

[7:20:06] yodaaxx: will you participate in the tourny or host it ? @Xaryu
[7:20:11] FlowersAnger: looks like you need to fight people that are a bit better at the game if you want practice haha
[7:20:17] naturalduck: If you do it in a BG, arcane surge might not be an issue

[7:21:45] tylerran34: you say nerf like they didnt get a massive dot buff
[7:21:46] windatar: I wish Ret pallies did better PVE wise, but PVP I like where my Ret pally is.
[7:21:48] relvap: yeah rogues looking good to
[7:21:49] Iol69: tell that to moonfirebeam, he tells anyone that says that they are stupid and know nothing about the game
[7:21:50] mindhatch23: mutilate is hitting ridiculously hard, can confirm

[7:22:37] dellator: just did bloobmoon, as arcane surge mage. that stuff is FUN!
[7:22:42] SkillaBBM: they should make your cooldowns dropped when starting every duel
[7:22:44] vash61: yes I love watching those dots tick for more when I’m dead waiting to release

[7:23:24] chonky_p: leeway?
[7:23:25] bigld8848: yes
[7:23:27] kushcoma007: Nerf hunter
[7:23:28] fernandorbretas: he forgot to use bow
[7:23:31] DirteeG: prolly some desync too
[7:23:31] CrewcutChuck: false
[7:23:35] fernandorbretas: and almost won
[7:23:35] iPlayCuzFun: @FlowersAnger false
[7:23:38] szaziz: how do u heal ur self mid fight @Xaryu
[7:23:38] nock7urn4l: that was some lag it looked like
[7:23:39] shadowstorm_sod: Sounds like blizzard hit boxes to me
[7:23:50] YuraruY: @fernandorbretas cant use bow, xar was in deadzone
[7:23:50] SkillaBBM: looks like season of discovery is full of these bugs and unbalanced stuff. still banging tho
[7:23:50] yungmortar: is feral any good in pvp?
[7:23:54] bigld8848: +2 yards with a talent
[7:23:55] erawin1990: yup ddos

[7:24:10] Iol69: @bigld8848 thats ranged only im pretty sure
[7:24:10] AmanceG: that fucking cat does way to much damage
[7:24:11] iPlayCuzFun: @FlowersAnger true
[7:24:11] elsuich_hs: feelWhat feelWhat feelWhat feelWhat feelWhat
[7:24:11] kushcoma007: his pet killed you
[7:24:11] grauchlol: deadzone is the worst mechanic anyway Kappa
[7:24:17] FlowersAnger: @iPlayCuzFun :p
[7:24:19] lsdeeezus: just block beastial
[7:24:19] nock7urn4l: I wish they would give either dual spec or free respecs lol
[7:24:23] thebigdongerhere: Hm seems like everyone can 1shot
[7:24:24] fiskensfriend: @Xaryu U can LB lF and sit block while he dies
[7:24:24] iPlayCuzFun: those tigers are insaaaane
[7:24:28] justingatlin: they need to nerf rogue, with all the abilities now they have nearly 100% uptime on target + too high damage @Xaryu
[7:24:30] Ragi_Fz: I honestly feel like Blizz needs to replace Arcane Surge with a different rune, it would be a shame to have yet ANOTHER useless ass rune as mage if it does get nuked with nerfs
[7:24:31] FurylordD: when are frost mage runes getting buffed
[7:24:32] galpha: !bindings
[7:24:35] amazonianshroomsniffer: xarBomb xarCoC

[7:24:47] dramajohns: with frost, block last sec. living flame with kill it
[7:24:48] sparkqs: warlocks can't
[7:24:50] FurylordD: @Ayomeer 1k mortal strike crits
[7:24:50] shadowstorm_sod: No feral
[7:24:50] wellrath: @Xaryu  as frost i only beat hunters by sitting in iceblock during his entire red pet
[7:24:51] GrubsteakMcGilicuty: boomies could
[7:24:52] Iol69: didnt you say you wanted all classes to be overpowered instead of nerfed
[7:24:52] amazonianshroomsniffer: fastest tournament ever lmao
[7:24:53] ltkp2018: agreed. dont like the 1 shot ability
[7:24:58] xiClutchBoyix: damage too juiced rn with rune abilities being so strong and scaling so well
[7:24:59] elementzia: we need more stamina on gear
[7:25:01] AceBeta: sure a warrior can one shot xD
[7:25:02] xtinzyx: warlock cant
[7:25:02] elementzia: to balance it out
[7:25:02] LESSQEWQEWMOREPEWPEW: some runes are just way overtuned with 0 balance in mind
[7:25:03] jonisyntinen: @Xaryu HP will solve this problem
[7:25:04] Lozuc_: lvl 60 dmg with instant casts with lvl 40 health :(
[7:25:04] latenightsuckmeright: its slows down
[7:25:04] grauchlol: itemisation for dmg > stam/defenses atm
[7:25:05] probeu: i hate it
[7:25:06] problys: just imagine next phase lol better gear more runes
[7:25:07] Knocktoff: do you love twinks?
[7:25:07] pipefull: no its always been die in cheapshot + kidney lol
[7:25:07] latenightsuckmeright: becuase of enchants
[7:25:08] GrubsteakMcGilicuty: warlock can
[7:25:08] Mandoogles: i think its gonna be insane at 60 honestly
[7:25:08] tylerran34: they just messed with the new rune scaling too hard
[7:25:09] Aeoxy: stamina isnt scaling with rune power
[7:25:11] dovahtv_: hopefully shamens one shot
[7:25:12] Biddy_: chaos is good
[7:25:17] drajov: or just less dmg
[7:25:18] latenightsuckmeright: when you have 1k health enchants at 39
[7:25:18] MadMaxy01: damage is buffed a lot while health isnt
[7:25:20] shadowstorm_sod: Season of broken
[7:25:20] gunzpewpew: I personally think that crits need to be capped
[7:25:20] latenightsuckmeright: yea
[7:25:20] dellator: get robes of the lich RFD
[7:25:21] risettefreya: @xaryu well you wanted classic +, and classic + is more like retail than classic so…
[7:25:21] Jayceza: Or implement resilience
[7:25:23] testiklees3: bro i got tons of stamina, and almost 4 k as bear, and i still get 1 shot
[7:25:24] FurylordD: @Ayomeer still not a oneshot but its good damage atleast
[7:25:24] Ardal_Obe: 50% reduction in damage and healing in pvp
[7:25:25] erawin1990: yea it should be boosted like in bgs
[7:25:25] testiklees3: not gona help
[7:25:26] andypandynz: zero counter play aint fun
[7:25:27] coneheadnor: rogue lock and warrior cant 1 shot
[7:25:28] wellrath: IF they increased everyones hp by 50 % the pvp would not feel like shit
[7:25:33] marcusartz: if they add stamina then need to fix bosses damage to
[7:25:34] erawin1990: but all the time
[7:25:37] rosbaek: please buff health ! would make the game so more enjoyable
[7:25:38] Heazzly: to much spelldamage on gear
[7:25:40] tsetse2fly: The gear for dps and the runes scale much higher
[7:25:40] VacaSlamBang: just give everyone versatility as stat Kappa
[7:25:41] Thrively: @dovahtv_ there's a pvp video of an OP ele shaman, it's nuts
[7:25:42] shadowvypers: they had the same problem in original wow and more health didnt fix it
[7:25:44] jonisyntinen: More hp and its good
[7:25:44] ImEffidja: so sad arena in wow is dead ;(
[7:25:46] Fendersquire: it's like the Oprah show, you get a one shot, you get a one shot, everybody gets one
[7:25:47] ddraggbagg: hope in P3, they add defensive talents though
[7:25:47] gunzpewpew: @coneheadnor I crit for 1400 with ambush
[7:25:48] xiClutchBoyix: make stamina give 15 hp like int does to mana.  easy clap
[7:25:49] nock7urn4l: if they add PvP health that may solve it
[7:25:49] erawin1990: hp is boosted in bgs
[7:25:51] Herculas95: New hair looks way better
[7:25:58] erawin1990: u running around with 3-4k in bgs
[7:26:03] bald_n_gorgeous: They gotta add more health in bgs or change spells for pvp combat imo
[7:26:06] relvap: they should add arena 1 vs 1
[7:26:09] tellmeagainiforgot: Just make stam 1.5 Hp per 1 stam like Intellect is
[7:26:11] dovahtv_: wish theyd bring arenas to SOD
[7:26:18] wellrath: but like, cloth users has no stamina at all on gear, my hunter friend has 2 x my hp so if they just does % increase across the board. it's gonna suck in a different way
[7:26:21] MajesticAFx: there seems to be a lot of people playing doesnt seem dead at all
[7:26:21] ludomag: are ret paly any good ?
[7:26:24] coneheadnor: @gunzpewpew ppl have more hp then that tho its not p1 xD
[7:26:24] FurylordD: @Xaryu when are frost mage runes getting buffed
[7:26:25] Pixiepantss: Sadge
[7:26:25] Judeese: LMAO
[7:26:25] justingatlin: u cant make higher hp-pools in relation to open world its too strong, u need to reduce dmg in pvp overall bys 30% i can confirm @Xaryu

[7:26:47] CrewcutChuck: I couldn't come back to play p2, P1 was kinda a let down imo. Raid was way way to ezmode, pvp was pretty bad in ashenvale, and the phase was too long. Glad people are liking it still tho
[7:26:48] yodaaxx: sit in block and summon the water
[7:26:55] amazonianshroomsniffer: xarIQ xarIQ xarIQ
