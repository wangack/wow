[4:21:06] spartaprimez: I think it will have scene with Vader hunting down the jedi. I am sure Obi saves some of them

[4:24:47] Silentstorm13318: Think about it...
[4:25:03] spartaprimez: Wolf it's painful watching them two fight.  They are my favorite Saber duel to watch.  Obi vs Anaking is intense
[4:25:31] wolftwenty: oof talk about a fight to the bitter end
[4:25:36] spartaprimez: They'll probably tease vader at the end of the season.  Was that Han Solo's gun in the trailer ?
[4:26:31] Silentstorm13318: That was just another Sith Lord.
[4:26:34] wolftwenty: they are watching covering each other with cc
