[2:13:46] starkos7: the ground slam throws you in a completely random direction, your positioning for it doesn't matter
[2:14:11] pockethealzzz: You need to stay 2 nd highest threat

[2:51:32] Chiraakitteh: Anyone experienced with TBC feral who can suggest a good mob to practice powershifting on? Most things die too fast or hurt too much to concentrate on the rotation.

[3:33:38] realdevv: Ferals are just the best gruul offtanks, but a good feral pumper has to almost afk against a warr/pala or he pulls.
[3:34:00] seanycash36: kd with the air ball
[3:34:01] dinomiyte: did durant jack up an airball?
[3:34:09] realdevv: I did 850 dps last gruul as feral in bear.
[3:34:12] realdevv: Nutty threat
[3:34:15] bantuatha: So Magtheridon's lair is next?
[3:34:17] BlueBeast33: KD should have drove to get a better shot

[3:42:29] hummak5: big bois dont flask
[3:42:32] realdevv: Thats the downside of a small server, flasks are 40-50g on Gehennas.
[3:42:36] realdevv: We mass produce that shit.
[3:42:48] DanZep90: consumable prices are through the roof
[3:43:43] Chiraakitteh: Yeah guild doesnâ€™t have enough max lvl (both 70 and 375 prof) to make that stuff yet
[3:43:44] Masqerader: funny thing about the OT, it only took 4 minutes for the Bucks to actually score in OT
[3:44:00] strav_ious: 3 minute debuff
[3:44:04] wulffsuper: Need 4 teams
[3:44:04] strav_ious: Youll need at LEAST 4 groups
[3:44:15] Colt_Engineer: this music tho
[3:44:30] bantuatha: I think?
[3:44:42] wulffsuper: Boss is on timer
[3:44:43] Cudqt: the adds are part of the fight
[3:44:44] JCAnderson1983: They are phase 1 of the fight
[3:44:49] strav_ious: Adds are part of fight
[3:45:30] JCAnderson1983: most likely, you won't have all the adds dead before he spawns in
[3:45:46] strav_ious: Make sure you have people interrupting everything they cast. Trash and boss adds.
[3:46:33] neverbornlucky: Parents looked at my like I was crazy cause I want a meat Grinder to make burgers with instead of buying ground beef
[3:46:46] realdevv: Need to assign 2+ interupts per channeler.
[3:46:51] realdevv: Main & backup for both heal and shadowbolt.
[3:47:07] daniel85mg: lol
[3:47:48] realdevv: Curse of tongues is pretty mandatory yeah
[3:47:56] neverbornlucky: so 9.1 comes out june 29th what will Towelliee do Retail or TBC
[3:48:01] CritcobainTV: We only have 1 lock
[3:48:17] realdevv: He needs to put tongues on every add on mag p1 instantly
[3:48:31] CritcobainTV: ok m8
[3:49:05] naeviah: Naeviah subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 35 months! 
[3:49:08] QQisLIVE: And keep tongues up. It doesn't last long
[3:49:18] MN_Generic: this fights going to be rough no ones interrupting already lol
[3:49:41] PhoenixAuTv: @Towelliee your not aloud to enjoy both god dammit :P
[3:50:01] QQisLIVE: I did Mags/Gruuls in 35 Minutes. TBC barely requires any time currently lol

[3:50:56] rsimpson105: best drop from this fight is the bag LUL
[3:51:31] DigiSeven: I no longer play WoW, I went back for TBC fun, but have stopped that too. I still really enjoy watching content here :)
[3:53:27] Thagrius: it's funny Currently some AoE abilities are generating zero threat sometimes. including swipe and consecration
[3:53:44] CritcobainTV: They already fixed that
[3:53:48] Thagrius: I thought I was crazy tanking earlier
[3:53:49] CritcobainTV: or so they said
[3:53:49] Moobot: Check out Towelliee's latest Youtube video! https://youtu.be/U8-64zqVa8k Shadowlands needs some help
[3:54:00] Chiraakitteh: Iâ€™ve given up on swipe... just try to put lacerate on everything
[3:54:00] Thagrius: this was 5 hours ago I read about it
[3:55:07] realdevv: Lacerate is only worth it on boss tanking, if you gear offensively swipe is insane for aoe.

[3:57:04] zuna1904: they cant attack you. they need to channel ! pre-activision iq blizzard
[3:57:15] realdevv: 20 clickers, atleast 10 interupters assigned.
[3:58:26] Thagrius: when did potions and health stones get changed for bears?
[3:58:40] Chiraakitteh: Swipe only seems to work if the dps really donâ€™t touch anything other than main target. Doesnâ€™t even seem to overcome healer threat if they pre-hot.
[3:58:41] Thagrius: I never played druid in tbc
[3:58:56] beardedbro84: blood bath inc guzuHappy
[3:58:58] realdevv: @Thagrius No idea but i still shapeshift while tanking for ironshields & haste pots, all you need is a swing timer addon LuL
[3:59:10] Chiraakitteh: @thagrius What do you mean changed? Bears need to power shift to use a potion
[3:59:44] realdevv: @Chiraakitteh You are probably very dad geared then, cuz in heroics people struggle to even outdps me when i tank i hold like 800-1000 dps steady on trash swiping away.
[3:59:46] CritcobainTV: but eventually they dont
[3:59:54] realdevv: Threat is a non issue at that point.
[3:59:54] Thagrius: yep just wondering when if was changed so it didnt drop form
[4:00:04] CritcobainTV: @realdevv we fucking get it, you're a god. JEsus
[4:00:05] Chiraakitteh: I think it became possible for bears to use pots without shifting in Wrath

[4:01:45] realdevv: @Chiraakitteh Yeah its rough when you are early geared, need a lot of AP/Critt then it becomes fun.
[4:01:52] realdevv: Rage gen is huge with 40%~ critt.
[4:01:54] Chiraakitteh: So gear on dps can really vary and on pull doesnâ€™t seem to matter if they donâ€™t wait... same old story

[4:03:04] realdevv: @Chiraakitteh Well when you get in the habit of pooling rage, pull threat is fine since you can go ham with a full rage bar every pack or boss.
[4:03:14] BlueBeast33: This part is definitely easier with multiple Warlocks
[4:03:18] Ravenward: bring more locks to banish
[4:03:37] Chiraakitteh: Most fun has been tanking multigroup quest bosses that hit hard, no rage issues then
[4:03:39] devilhawk83: I think ice trap also works
