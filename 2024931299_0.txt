[1:43:29] guerillatac: @p1ckleyama cobalt will be disappointed tho NotLikeThis
[1:43:31] p1ckleyama: sack transformation pog
[1:43:33] lunatic2444: is this speedrun or random streaks?
[1:43:49] Draleric: !top
[1:43:49] Nightbot: If there is a character name at the top of chat, he is on random character random boss !streak file with no game-play changing mods. If there's not, there's a good chance hes doing Tainted Lost to Mother streak on a different file. If theres a timer at the top ingame, he's probably doing !speedrun
[1:43:50] Mrazulik: Madge where is that healt up tho
[1:43:57] communal_: zekeTHINK
[1:43:57] Morphshu: cobaltHMM

[1:44:28] guerillatac: @p1ckleyama do I still get the unlocks ?
[1:44:28] Lilgiff: Random streak cause you sat and did nothing
[1:44:32] Guuwyy: youre a god
[1:44:56] p1ckleyama: @guerillatac Yes! Save for a very small few items. Theres like 4 or 5 things that you can only unlock on hard
