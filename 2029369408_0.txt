[0:10:44] hooqs: the wind and snow here in bc is wild
[0:10:53] Slitelohel: 10 degrees in Texas next week
[0:10:54] gelatokush: one yr of sub in wow if u just pay per month on your card is like 250 a years around the same price as a gym member ship, coincidence, I think not
[0:10:54] aragarde: wear double everything
[0:10:59] aarongarey1993: It's 1 degrees Celsius here and I'm cold I can't imagine how you feel
[0:11:00] BigBubz: We just got a ft n half drop in winnipeg here been fun

[0:11:44] SweatyDaniels: thats b/c the earth is flat
[0:11:56] mariopiller: probably because the polar votrex walls are a bit wobbly atm
[0:12:01] pharmztko: rukiBlankie rukiBlankie rukiBlankie rukiBlankie

[0:12:30] Saitistreamy: god damn
[0:12:39] Ambersulfr: gm
[0:12:47] sp9o: big dam
[0:12:56] wEiRdO_dUdE: lava lava lava
[0:14:18] Ambersulfr: you don't like the spammable death ray that does pve dam? weird.
[0:14:37] pharmztko: take that dr Wayne!
[0:14:45] Varaben: @Ambersulfr BZZZZZZT
[0:14:45] donniyo: why does nobody kick disintegrate
[0:14:47] donniyo: wild
[0:14:57] Ambersulfr: because they run out of kicks
[0:14:59] gelatokush: play kick
[0:14:59] Ambersulfr: shits spammable
[0:15:05] Saitistreamy: dev  % climbs as you go higher in rating
[0:15:27] gelatokush: nah i fw in every lobby just kick him MyAvatar
[0:15:51] Ambersulfr: it's a channel, it's destroying you from first tick. It's not like a hard hitting spell where you kick it and it stops the damage entirely.
[0:15:54] Gotheels: surprised you don’t see more devs in high rated 3s comps. maybe cause of sub rouges
[0:15:55] Ambersulfr: to really stop it you gotta insta kick it
[0:16:06] gelatokush: yup
[0:16:14] aragarde: them rogues get you dragons
[0:16:22] gelatokush: u kick disentegrate as much as u can nothing more u can do
[0:16:23] Slitelohel: I'm going to be the most okay rogue to ever play the game
[0:16:28] Slitelohel: Just you wait and see.
[0:16:35] aragarde: like when rogues did the quest to murder dragons for wrathion lol
[0:16:36] whinkies: dev 100% needs atleast that like 30% buff it got on dis revoked if not more to their dmg like eterinity surge lol
[0:17:23] Xeliumimar: "everyones fine right"
[0:17:26] Ambersulfr: guess they weren't fine
[0:17:31] whinkies: id like a tradeoff of like getting maybe dream proj to make mage/hunter matchups more bareable i lsot to alot of rmx hunter comps on my climb to glad lol
[0:17:47] pharmztko: ??heals
[0:17:51] Ambersulfr: ??
[0:17:59] gelatokush: dev are fine imo i dc they do alot of dmg they are killable and have some weak points
[0:18:41] Ambersulfr: their death beam could use adjustment
[0:18:55] whinkies: they got a 30% buff on it that needs to go away lol
[0:18:59] gelatokush: maybe but if dont dont do alot of dmg the spec is litteraly useles
[0:19:20] nikthevoker: buff devoker
[0:19:26] Ambersulfr: sure but it's ticking too high rn considering you don't have to finish a cast for it, can't ground it, and kick lockouts are low
[0:19:31] mvpJ_: holding rescue for next match
[0:19:38] nikthevoker: you can ground it
[0:19:43] Ambersulfr: it kills the grounding
[0:19:46] Ambersulfr: it gets a tick or two
[0:19:58] gelatokush: i dont mind disen tuning they need to put dmgg somewhere else then
[0:20:03] whinkies: yeah but it makes the evoker waste 3 essence so its still worth to ground
[0:20:29] whinkies: It does not need more dmg it has plenty with living flame procs fire breath and eternity surge
[0:20:39] gelatokush: the class was legit not played at all b4 buffs aand thats says alot imo
[0:20:40] SweatyDaniels: casual 160k HPS
[0:20:49] Ambersulfr: no one's saying to gut it
[0:20:55] nikthevoker: ive never had a double dev lobby til now
[0:21:11] nikthevoker: they went a little over
[0:22:03] gelatokush: personally ive been enjoying dev so im a bit bias but i prefer alto more the disentegrate playstyle then the all in one combo deep breath from s1
[0:22:05] pharmztko: tyyrexGandalfparty
[0:22:08] Ambersulfr: niiiiice
[0:22:17] SweatyDaniels: Healer question - do you think it would be more fun or frustrating for a resto druid main to learn mistweaver?
[0:22:18] Varaben: rukiLove rukiLove rukiLove
[0:22:22] Xeliumimar: the fire eaters vial gave you swag!
[0:22:23] crymorre: EZ HYPERCLAP
[0:22:29] mvpJ_: have you played the new bg blitz much?
[0:22:33] Hotaruz: thats was a THICK leg sweep
[0:22:48] Hotaruz: never skip leg day boys
[0:22:49] aragarde: don't think hes done much blitz
[0:22:54] aragarde: just shuffles
[0:23:24] Xeliumimar: high skill cap for evoker
[0:23:27] Saitistreamy: how many buttons is devestation evoker?
[0:23:38] Saitistreamy: like Aff level or Ele
[0:23:43] zachgamegodx: ven, any way we could have morning tea sometime
[0:24:07] zachgamegodx: no? ok
[0:24:32] Xeliumimar: what are you farming
[0:24:42] zachgamegodx: rukiChamp￼ rukiChamp
[0:24:50] Xeliumimar: put a rop in that tree LOL
[0:25:28] zachgamegodx: next week uncapped at least
[0:25:37] ItsBees: Ven if you get all the treasures there you get some ridiculous antlers, it's p sweet
[0:25:47] Ambersulfr: still waiting on confirmation
[0:25:50] zachgamegodx: not confirmed
[0:25:54] zachgamegodx: but hopefully
[0:26:02] ayosteviey: Last .5 patch uncapped conq
[0:26:06] Axtin: the way we usually know is because the boxes end up on ptr
[0:26:20] ayosteviey: DAMN
[0:26:21] slooter: got put in a 2k lobby on my fresh Rdruid alt :/
[0:26:23] Axtin: they aint there
[0:26:30] aragarde: isn't it always once people hit 7k conquest that they release the boxes
[0:26:34] p0ppr0cks: gigachad backpedal
[0:26:39] p0ppr0cks: let him win
[0:26:59] Varaben: ice cold angle here
[0:27:01] Ambersulfr: I hope they add it in before tuesday when they put the next patch out
[0:27:03] Axtin: leeka will let us know in 0.00001 seconds if he sees the boxes on ptr
[0:27:15] leeka: i checked last night :)
[0:27:24] Ambersulfr: leeka op
[0:27:37] Childz: poor fella
[0:27:39] SweatyDaniels: s-tier mage mobility
[0:28:02] leeka: i think they hotfixed them in after the patch went live the last couple times
[0:28:06] Taevenx: In Leeka We Trust <3
[0:28:45] Ambersulfr: the timing of the changes sometimes makes me wonder if the pvp devs are just the regular devs w/ extra night shifts
[0:28:51] Ambersulfr: pvp balance usually also lags
[0:32:15] Varaben: IBF next game
[0:32:19] SweatyDaniels: how many deathstrikes
[0:32:32] psychic241: can tell a low rated dps lobby insta
[0:32:45] ameloly: Pet cleave with Clap
[0:32:47] tmiller87: sheiluns gift is pretty big to top your team in 3s
[0:33:10] GI_Jake_: how is monk heals?
[0:33:15] gelatokush: sheiluns is so good
[0:33:32] Ambersulfr: the 100 mmr spread between dps and healers makes this part of the ladder a lot less fun
[0:33:42] snkywings: LOL
[0:33:48] PromiscuousToilet: this rogue is so confused
[0:34:08] Ambersulfr: I think he's just slow
[0:34:09] Varaben: he thinks the SP is going to solo 2 melee for him?
[0:34:12] james_gamingMD: can he not weave damage in at all while also locking you down
[0:34:15] Ambersulfr: by the time he sends his damage his cc has worn off
[0:34:28] PromiscuousToilet: @james_gamingMD no. thats why they are confused as to how rogue works KEKW
[0:34:30] GI_Jake_: im NGL i am ass at rogue now they have changed so much over the years
[0:34:46] gelatokush: practice makes percfect :D
[0:34:51] Ambersulfr: well, this guy is making the mistake of using his mobility to get to his cc target
[0:34:56] Ambersulfr: so then he has to walk back to his kill target
[0:34:58] brainey_: how is the que times as dps these days
[0:35:04] PromiscuousToilet: isnt this like 2100 mmr tho?
[0:35:08] psychic241: warr holds fear all game, what a legend
[0:35:08] Ambersulfr: it is
[0:35:09] james_gamingMD: yea
[0:35:26] PromiscuousToilet: helps make the point that glad titles shouldnt be given out in SS then haha
[0:35:27] Varaben: mw is oom, sweatin through the warrior damage
[0:35:37] ItsBees: #ballsout
[0:35:46] Axtin: puttin your balls out eh?
[0:35:56] PromiscuousToilet: put your balls on the wall
[0:35:58] Blitzylive: must be scripting
[0:35:59] SweatyDaniels: ayo dagger warrior
[0:36:07] Ambersulfr: make sure to put both balls out
[0:36:15] Ambersulfr: gotta spread the love
[0:36:15] Moobot: YouTube channel: youtube.com/venruki * Subscribe for new content!
[0:36:33] gelatokush: i think they should give equivalent of glad title and mount in SS, not like glad is prestigious nowdays
[0:36:33] james_gamingMD: as someone who has casually pvp'd never in arena - started SS last week on uh dk and im already 1900 so i agree with not giving titles out
[0:36:51] Ambersulfr: the new healer title is bugged KEKW
[0:36:55] james_gamingMD: idk, maybe
[0:37:01] wEiRdO_dUdE: The warrior is a juicer
[0:37:11] yajirobeix: no fw? :(
[0:37:15] gelatokush: anybody with a credit card can get glad u dont neeed skills at all
[0:37:17] Varaben: warrior just 150k dps all game ez
[0:37:28] PromiscuousToilet: @gelatokush its certainly a lot harder than getting 2400 in ss as evidenced by this 2100 rogue who afk ccs and doesnt weave it
[0:37:41] james_gamingMD: ^
[0:37:43] PromiscuousToilet: @gelatokush harder in 3s* not ss
[0:37:45] OMGWhatsHisFace: i think glad mount should be a small% drop after every game, like raid mounts. Kappa. But That still makes more sense than giving glad for real in ss
[0:37:56] gelatokush: cuz in ss at 2100 your fighting 2100 players and at 2100 in 3s your fighting 3700 xp players
[0:38:06] Hizuru1: Chat with cooked takes
[0:38:09] james_gamingMD: @gelatokush actual
[0:38:21] gelatokush: they devalued any achievment when they added wow token
[0:38:23] PromiscuousToilet: @gelatokush bad season for sure with the deflatoin.
[0:38:26] gelatokush: u can buy everyuthing
[0:38:31] OMGWhatsHisFace: @gelatokush they're literally at 21cr fighting ven, a player with more r1s than almost anyone
[0:38:31] PromiscuousToilet: also true
[0:38:41] PromiscuousToilet: @gelatokush just take everything out of the game. shut it all down.
[0:38:42] Ambersulfr: those same company sell ss boosts
[0:38:46] Ambersulfr: so lets not pretend that's 3s only
[0:38:48] kreyzy8: we weren't chillin as much as we thought LUL
[0:38:51] donniyo: dies with vanish
[0:38:52] gelatokush: ven is not r1 on mw
[0:38:56] hooqs: rogues need to be buffed
[0:38:56] Hizuru1: @gelatokush dude what a mentality if you lose 3v2 you just bad
[0:39:37] PromiscuousToilet: blizzard makes service channels in wow and encourages sells. wont let you get carrie diablo 4 KEKW
[0:39:58] OMGWhatsHisFace: @gelatokush so? you think he plays like your typical 21 mw? his years of experience count for naught? come on dude. mediocre argument.
[0:40:15] gelatokush: has nothing to do i just said since they added token evey achievement is worth nothing , sso they should be adding equivalent of glad inn ss cuz why not more rewards for players to strive for
[0:40:16] Ambersulfr: ven is a good mw
[0:40:23] PromiscuousToilet: ven was r1 mw back when orb botting was a thing. dude was unstoppable haha
[0:40:25] kreyzy8: everyone on other team full hp KEKW
[0:40:36] Hizuru1: @promiscuoustoilet there is channel for RMT but not for being social and chatting in mmorpg says what are their priorities
[0:40:43] Ambersulfr: besides, winning or losing as a healer in solo shuffle is frequently unrelated to whether you heal well
[0:40:57] PromiscuousToilet: @Hizuru1 100% real and true.
[0:41:04] gelatokush: u cant stop alting eevryone has bunch of alts
[0:41:13] OMGWhatsHisFace: @gelatokush if they're worth nothing than give me glad title, r1 title, mount for queueing any 10 games of any ladder.
[0:41:15] gelatokush: ss is accesible game mode
[0:41:17] OMGWhatsHisFace: then*
[0:42:03] simonurbnk: I lvled monk today... and i might not even gear it its too many buttons and i never healed before :D Im so lost
[0:42:10] Hizuru1: @gelatokush git gud SS is meme for anti social clowns
[0:42:17] yajirobeix: you should fw against the unh dk, u win the round 100%
[0:42:25] wEiRdO_dUdE: Monks can definitely have a lot of buttons
[0:42:27] gelatokush: Asmon has made the same point for yrs and i agree with the statement tahs tif u can buy achieves it devalues it
[0:42:29] joe_suff: lol that looks fun
[0:42:30] PromiscuousToilet: SS is a terrible indicator of almost anything. its a good place to practice and get caps
[0:42:36] mosygod: hi i have a question, does anyone know why my adrenaline rush from stealth cancels my stealth? it even doesnt give me subterfuge after i pop it
[0:42:48] PromiscuousToilet: You can buy literally anything in wow now and blizz encourages it
[0:42:55] wEiRdO_dUdE: MMO mouse helps with classes like that
[0:42:57] Hizuru1: @gelatokush you are special clown
[0:42:59] OMGWhatsHisFace: @gelatokush asmon's takes on anything achievement related outside of mog collecting are worthless. dude was carried to every glad ever,
[0:43:24] Hizuru1: @omgwhatshisface dude wants all free no point talking
[0:43:28] simonurbnk: How does the fistweaving work
[0:43:33] ItsBees: so many L takes it's insane
[0:43:43] Nikademous: U punch and kick to heal
[0:43:46] PromiscuousToilet: asmon isnt a bad player. he could get basic glad. he has good player friends. why would you not utilize good players if you can?
[0:43:46] OMGWhatsHisFace: @Hizuru1 he doesnt even want it free. it's just that his argument doesnt track really.
[0:43:47] Nikademous: It's fun
[0:44:01] Hizuru1: @simonurbnk make one and read abilities
[0:44:37] gelatokush: bro if you dont agree that if you can buy glad with money it devalues the achieement, i dont know what else to say
[0:44:38] rembrandt89: rukiCreep rukiCreep rukiCreep
[0:45:01] rekt1370: to buy glad at this moment is either impossible or would cost 50 million LUL
[0:45:05] Hizuru1: @gelatokush you know you have to like play
[0:45:11] simonurbnk: @Hizuru1 I lvled monk yesterday and I just dont remember anything :D
[0:45:20] PromiscuousToilet: the whole game is devalued. everything is bought. pve and pvp
[0:45:26] rekt1370: nah it isn't
[0:45:28] PromiscuousToilet: just raise the glad cutoff ot 2700 EZ
[0:45:36] Nikademous: YT a guide Simon and practice in BGs
[0:45:39] PromiscuousToilet: or go back to top .05%
[0:45:43] Hizuru1: @simonurbnk read everything and just play you will figure it out intuitively
[0:45:46] Nikademous: I think you will like FW
[0:45:48] OMGWhatsHisFace: dude used disperse like it's lay on hands wtf
[0:45:50] rekt1370: cant buy glad atleast not right now
[0:46:02] hooqs: @rekt1370 ?
[0:46:04] PromiscuousToilet: issue with old way of glad titles is it was top 100 players and their alts
[0:46:04] rekt1370: ?
[0:46:06] psychic241: i swear u should just buy honor gear with better secondary stats
[0:46:07] Devcomz: I dont see mw often nvm a MW mirror in shuffle
[0:46:17] ndanas15: anyone else run out of mana on monk when facing other healers and that’s how you lose
[0:46:18] rekt1370: 2400 you going vs awc teams rank 1s you going to carry an 1800 player?
[0:46:19] Blitzylive: good save ven
[0:46:26] snkywings: @rekt1370 yes
[0:46:30] rekt1370: not a chance
[0:46:34] Ambersulfr: sometimes I wonder if part of the reason blizz keeps deflation low for half the season is to cut down on the profitability of sales.
[0:46:36] snkywings: if u play fmp u can
[0:46:36] OMGWhatsHisFace: @Devcomz the game tries to avoid matching healersof same class in ss
[0:46:43] crymorre: what are you ppl even talking about rn
[0:46:48] rekt1370: 2 rank 1s not beating 3 rank 1s in coms
[0:46:54] ItsBees: Can y'all get off this topic, my god the takes are bad
[0:46:56] PromiscuousToilet: CURRENT glad is hard. It will be buyable by end of the season when blizz messes with inflation. as always
[0:47:02] Hizuru1: @ambersulfr to extend playtime and so people sub longer and give them more money
[0:47:19] simonurbnk: should i play fistweaving as a  I heal for the first time ?
[0:47:21] Hizuru1: @ambersulfr literally they do everything to get money from you
[0:47:33] Ambersulfr: @Hizuru1 yeah exactly, then everyone has to keep playing to gear and then when they're done gearing the inflation is magically just enough for sales to start.
[0:48:03] PromiscuousToilet: @Ambersulfr welcome to earth. its a business, not UNICEF
[0:48:11] Devcomz: Watching this it seems MW healers have it rough compared to others for sure could just be this particular lobby though
[0:48:17] gelatokush: so you guys think we shouldnt add some type of glad mount to ss ?
[0:48:24] Grimm303: EZ

[0:48:37] Hizuru1: @simonurbnk try both you can change build anytime so experiment what you like, and imo go do 2v2 or 3v3 better for healers

[0:49:06] PromiscuousToilet: @Ambersulfr short term gains is the only thing they focus on

[0:49:36] NJMcChillan: i haven't even watched true blood but that song is embedded in me
[0:49:46] crymorre: Essaying
[0:49:52] PromiscuousToilet: @Ambersulfr yes, random twitch chatters better than a professional board of a business how to run said business KEKW

[1:00:31] aragarde: i like the flavor of it though

[1:09:19] ottx27: Guys is it a regular thing to get 0 cr people in 1.7s?
[1:09:21] fugginhiding: need more triple lizards
[1:09:39] rynosaurwow: It gets rid of his burst when he pops darkglare
[1:10:05] dickman911: stopping a sub go >> dispelling a couple UAs
[1:12:34] ferahgok: MW actually looks pretty nice to play as far as healers go. I like disc, hate rdruid. Never tried hpal
[1:12:53] rekt1370: so sick of rogues
[1:13:01] 8SNOW: you play fistweaver as well or only caster?
[1:13:04] rynosaurwow: That's why I just play port stun against sub. Personal preference I suppose
[1:13:21] NJMcChillan: fw is so unenjoyable for everyone
[1:13:25] NJMcChillan: i wish theyd just delete it
[1:13:46] 8SNOW: im enjoying casting more as well but top 10 ss only play fistweaver last time i checked
[1:13:49] mrshowtyme: do you play 2pc or 4 pc?
[1:13:51] NJMcChillan: well i guess its the only way that makes sense to play in pve
[1:14:01] gelatokush: i always liked revival more then restoral
[1:14:05] NJMcChillan: @8SNOW i think everyone except meep does, yeah
[1:14:09] ralotheret: you ever play grapple weapon?
[1:14:51] rembrandt89: double lock is always so annoying

[1:17:30] NJMcChillan: i got 1901 on my paladin last week and im still 1901 because ive gone 3-3 3x in a row
[1:17:31] deepTTV: que again
[1:17:33] moremantella255: dont sweat the petty stuff and dont pet the sweaty stuff
[1:17:33] gelatokush: healing ss made me bitter im taking a break off the game :D
[1:17:35] NJMcChillan: shit happens lol
[1:17:41] deepTTV: :)
[1:18:04] gelatokush: i have liek 15 000 rounds of healing i did my part
[1:18:46] deepTTV: @gelatokush hopefully your good at healing lmao
[1:19:01] gelatokush: nah according to ss im a 1600-2k healer
[1:19:02] Ambersulfr: the only gripe I have with it is branches that wider than they appear, and that's not a huge deal
[1:19:08] NJMcChillan: i like the emerald dream too but  the tree branches are a little intrusive
[1:19:11] Ambersulfr: that are*
[1:19:12] aragarde: you need to use regular flying to make it trivial
[1:19:13] NJMcChillan: yeah what amber said
[1:19:25] matt_caste: I use the flying broom to get to those things, need that precision
[1:20:09] What_ln_Tarnation: no
[1:20:12] iv9ry: you get a toy I think
[1:20:15] nympheteminefix: use a normal mount its easier
[1:20:16] gelatokush: a toy
[1:20:17] Hark0n: i mean u get 5 sparks
[1:20:20] matt_caste: You'll get 8 sparks
[1:20:44] gelatokush: u can mark him
[1:20:47] What_ln_Tarnation: i already have plenty of toys in my drawer
[1:20:54] wackpoetic: Oy! That bloody bird snatched me trifle!

[1:25:36] PromiscuousToilet: Ven, do you ever feel like a plastic bag floating on the wind?
[1:25:38] Itankarenas: @pookzys just scop it straight from the sea. fuck it

[1:25:41] wackpoetic: pookzys peepoWeird
[1:25:49] pookzys: not even kidding lol, look it up
[1:26:03] wackpoetic: I use Gatorlyte Zero to mix with my preworkout, that shit is cash yo
[1:26:04] pookzys: people usually put some celtic salt in water after working out
[1:26:08] pookzys: yeah they said its weird lol
[1:26:36] Itankarenas: evoker shield break dmg op
[1:26:36] fleet21_: drink salt to make u dehydrated so then u got more hydrated pog
[1:26:53] Luigicamp: TheIlluminati
[1:27:30] gelatokush: can u get hydrated drinking liquid air Kappa
[1:27:32] Itankarenas: gotta sip on that gin and juice
[1:28:18] BCboy_: wonder if the evoker is playing that shield breaking spell to break that cocoon
[1:28:56] thedonmac: duckWeird
[1:28:58] eMBeaR64oz: salt in the coffee removes bitterness actually, so its a good move
[1:28:58] Itankarenas: I just dunk a cup of salt in my mouth
[1:29:00] dickman911: mana management on MW feels a lil awkward to me, but i'm kinda a newb so i dunno.  do experienced MW have mana issues?
[1:29:02] Itankarenas: great way to start the day
[1:29:03] moremantella255: sodium, electrolytes
[1:29:09] Grimey_George: Have you tried that green stuff Xaryu likes to drink?
[1:29:10] moremantella255: basic chemistry
[1:29:20] Schnellmusic: old BMTH <3
[1:29:23] Itankarenas: @moremantella255 it's what plants crave
[1:29:39] Hozitojones: ty ven sorry didn't know u were streaming
[1:29:41] Hozitojones: <3
[1:30:56] Ambersulfr: "like a shaman" lmao
[1:31:12] NJMcChillan: so assa rogues can die at least i guess lol
[1:31:39] jporter_: @dickman911 you dont have to spam heals nearly as much as you think, that was my early issue
[1:31:47] NJMcChillan: i havent had mana issues in shuffle but ive bene losing some 2v2 games while the disc is at 60%
[1:32:03] ctrlbeesy: ww or devoker one shot better?
[1:32:04] joyrex_j9: every time you consume mana tea the amount of stacks you consume gives you the same amount in seconds of reduced mana cost
[1:32:09] dickman911: @jporter_ i think thats my problem, i get enveloping up, then hit an extra viv or two thats not needed
[1:32:23] dickman911: i know how mana tea works, just gotta get used to using it better
[1:32:25] joyrex_j9: so you wanna take little sips of mana tea before doing elveloping
[1:32:33] joyrex_j9: enveloping
[1:32:37] joyrex_j9: or summoning yulon
[1:32:40] wackpoetic: dickman911 ya a lot of the time all you need to di is get renewing + enveloping and just channel soothing for the bonus healing
[1:32:42] Hozitojones: if i wanna pay retail what I should be looking to do besides getting all my honor gear?
[1:33:15] NJMcChillan: gotta get your spark from the dream and war mode quests for tokens (there havent been any up this week basically)
[1:33:18] dickman911: @Hozitojones get sparks to craft gear via weekly quests and stuff helps
[1:33:19] flawfox: @Hozitojones honor gear first and then get the splintered sparks to make crafted gear with embellishments
[1:33:23] wackpoetic: Hozitojones Honor Gear, weekly BG Blitz quests give good conq, any world PvP quests for Tokens, and weekly Sparks quest
[1:33:38] joyrex_j9: even if you perfectly weave your mana teas MW goes oom faster than most healer atm
[1:33:50] Grimm303: just means you had high value cocoons
[1:33:59] jmaclicious_: if you’re looking into retail prob look at dragging the wow file to trash bin and then opening browser and watching twitch instead, much more enjoyable watching others suffer. @hozitojones
[1:34:10] dickman911: if you have stacked up honor on any characters, you can use it to by world PVP trophies of strife as well.  can be shared with any characters on account
[1:34:13] dpsEric: tragic timing
[1:34:17] soddi: evoker is the last class you wanna see a second go on on the enemy team :D
[1:34:19] Hozitojones: ty chat
[1:34:33] Hozitojones: @jmaclicious_ lmao
[1:34:34] nikthevoker: @Hozitojones sparks
[1:34:35] wEiRdO_dUdE: That shaman is ornery
[1:34:41] zachgamegodx: honestly if you're talking about shuffle, yo're always spamming heals, you need to use mana tea + Yulon but also one huge thing that's gonna make your hps skyrocket is you need a waeak aura that shows you the duration of ur lingering statue channel. after u finish a soothing mists, the statue continues channeling for 8sec, that means that the target is still getting 50% extra healing from your enveloping mist and renewing mist... can never let the channel from teh statue fall on teh target takin
[1:34:43] zachgamegodx: taking dmg
[1:34:49] nikthevoker: getting crafted gear, some classes want hellbloom gear to
[1:35:33] malvarcla: that dk is pumping hard jeez
[1:35:40] zachgamegodx: https://www.wowhead.com/spell=388593/peaceful-mending it's this talent, but it's actually 50%, idk why it shows 10 there
[1:36:32] flawfox: @Hozitojones there is also a youtube video by snupy for 10.2 gearing iirc
[1:36:44] Ambersulfr: just play better Kappa

[1:37:45] GnRHDota2: I see
[1:37:49] joyrex_j9: the playmaking ability of MW is unparalleled, you need to be going 6/0 on such an aggressive healer
[1:37:53] dakotan517: retail best version out rn by alot

[1:54:56] Hozitojones: gonna hit the gym have a nice stream ven <3
[1:55:21] Hozitojones: chest/tricep
[1:55:24] Ambersulfr: sv, boomkin, and sp are all really low count r1 slots so they're probably pretty high rank for their spec at 2.1
[1:55:32] Ambersulfr: arms is arms, there are a ton of them
[1:55:43] gelatokush: Ven can u do pistol squats ?
[1:55:47] xGriefxGodx: ambev best mod
[1:55:59] Ambersulfr: @xGriefxGodx <3
[1:56:31] wreklol: just be like the average china/korea player. have 3 accounts. 2 for shuffle/win trading 3s and the 3rd you run a gold farming bot on to pay for the subs for all 3. ez. blizzard bans you once a year and you buy game codes from a third party in bulk so you can constantly make new accounts. EZ
[1:56:42] flawfox: @gelatokush the real challenge are dragon squats fam
[1:56:57] gelatokush: bro pistol squats are hard asfuck
[1:57:18] flawfox: nah, takes like 1-2 weeks to build up if you semi fit
[1:57:25] flawfox: dragon squats asks way more
[1:57:41] flawfox: comparable strength but balance and mobility
[1:57:57] Nikademous: Naw son oatmeal squats where it's at
[1:58:13] malvarcla: nah try th rainbow sun kitty squat, way more intense
[1:58:18] Nikademous: U squat while eating a bowl of oatmeal
[1:58:28] Nikademous: Oh true Malv I've heard of those
[1:58:38] Applezbtw: prob plays with "irl friends" that everyone says they tank with LUL
[1:59:24] gelatokush: idk cuz im 33 and i can barely do i pistol squat, im not the most in shape but def not the worst either XD
[1:59:42] joyrex_j9: its more of a skill than a feat of strength
[1:59:54] PromiscuousToilet: why bother with these unique squats? just do regular stuff and youll get results and risk breaking your body KEKW
[1:59:54] dickman911: I got some solid twitch chat expertise, but more is welcome too
[2:00:01] joyrex_j9: lotta people dont have the ankle mobility
[2:00:02] PromiscuousToilet: not risK*
[2:00:19] malvarcla: or the upside down sun squat
[2:00:29] gelatokush: cuz i saw a video of a girl doing 28 for 100 bucks on youtube s oi decided to try it and was liek sheet that thing is hard
[2:00:41] Nikademous: Naw stick with rainbow sun kitty
[2:00:42] NJMcChillan: boy i miss roll cancelling because i ALWAYS go too far
[2:00:59] NJMcChillan: i roll in for sweep or tod and im like oops im past them
[2:01:04] joyrex_j9: just gotta regress the movement a bit and work up to it while you develop the mobility
[2:01:05] gelatokush: i work in construction and a shovle alot of asphate and walk alot so def not the most out of shape its def hard
[2:01:26] anacronz: What's the most fun healer to play for you?

[2:33:04] notkoalars: I think the damage is a little crazy sometimes
[2:33:09] mayonaes: WW is scarwy so people burn all cc on them
[2:33:22] N0TPaul: a wq is 15 sparks, i believe.
[2:33:45] crymorre: yup, some specs damage varies wildly depending on what spec they attack it's massive
[2:33:56] snosiop: its right there you have to /sleep to get it
[2:34:00] pugulus_prime: if they lower armor they would have to also lower caster damage
[2:34:21] Ambersulfr: I'm ok with reducing mobility
[2:34:23] Ambersulfr: it's way too much rn
[2:34:32] JakloomGaming770: do you think armor is too strong? or whats the issue w/ it? I always felt like it didnt really do anythinng
[2:34:41] Qyzme: Armor should mitigste every dmg Not only physical
[2:34:57] johnwelchhh: no warrior is tanky enough
[2:34:57] mayonaes: I think SP needs more mobility, something like a void teleport
[2:35:07] Ambersulfr: armor helps make caster metas viable though
[2:35:08] notkoalars: doesn’t armour take more mage damage ?
[2:35:11] johnwelchhh: give sp stealth
[2:35:27] EliteDamit: maybe an armor squish. bring the bottom end up a tad and the top end down a tad
[2:35:37] dcode200: just give evry one the same and all happy
[2:36:01] johnwelchhh: mages are tanky af
[2:36:01] notkoalars: I feel like a frost mage would hit a lot harder on a warrior vs a warlock or sp
[2:36:05] Hark0n: honest shadowpriests need a god damn slow
[2:36:34] notkoalars: I thought mage definitely ignored the armour bonus
[2:37:01] mneYEP: @Hark0n why? spriest isnt gonna outrun anything anyway LUL
[2:37:19] EliteDamit: @notkoalars armor is just Physical damage reduction
[2:37:38] notkoalars: @elitedamit right
[2:37:48] notkoalars: just confirming
[2:38:31] Ambersulfr: I'd buy it
[2:38:37] mneYEP: outlaw is insane

[2:42:51] johnwelchhh: so ir feral are the hardest because you get ran iunto the ground

[2:43:44] ALLtheEXP: Ayyy Maldivans!
[2:43:50] syrox_219: ferals die so quick thats why im thinking its the hardest class to play rn
[2:44:06] Aroty: Lol, I just came from his stream organically. Who knew
[2:44:08] ALLtheEXP: I think SP has gotta be a tougher one rn
[2:44:11] bigislandcoconuts: how are you liking mw?
[2:44:13] dankent130: hell ya Maldiva !
[2:44:14] malvarcla: swag
[2:44:16] bigislandcoconuts: compared to other healers
[2:44:29] dankent130: sp just gets trained so hard
[2:44:37] dickman911: BM gets a bad rap cuz it is pretty easy and the pets are so annoying but there are definitely more complexities than most people consider.  i see a LOT of really bad BMs
[2:44:38] arcane_p: @sourbutts that's hilarious
[2:44:55] syrox_219: but sp gets trained like every expansion
[2:45:07] dankent130: facts
[2:45:08] fosterz: what are the best comps for ww in 3s to push ?
[2:45:14] ALLtheEXP: SP is a fast track to learning how to play a caster while being pummeled
[2:45:15] syrox_219: its their job to move the enemy player in bad positions
[2:45:25] mayonaes: they just need to give sp a mobility spell
[2:45:29] dakotan517: living as bm is kinda hard
[2:45:32] mayonaes: they gave everyone else one
[2:45:44] ALLtheEXP: @mayonaes I'd be cool with this ngl
[2:45:52] dankent130: I think they need more dot damage, the ramp up takes too long for 3s unless they are top tier with good partners
[2:45:53] Sovice: They have feather
[2:45:58] Sovice: and fade freedom
[2:45:59] mayonaes: feather is terrible
[2:46:01] ALLtheEXP: feather is a joke
[2:46:04] Sovice: we need to stop giving mobility, and actually nerf it
[2:46:10] dankent130: fade is nice feather is shit
[2:46:12] bigslawomir1: Does season 3 wep illusion look cool?
[2:46:44] dankent130: we need the meta not to be 15 active pets lol
[2:46:47] highmoon7: I feel like boomkin is the new mage. best spamable cc in the game
[2:47:03] Sovice: Feather isn't that bad lol, 3 charges for 40% move speed, it's super reminiscent of burst of speed
[2:47:05] sourbutts: @arcane_p kinda true tho
[2:47:07] dakotan517: dang 1 round and some1 left the shuffle rip
[2:47:11] ALLtheEXP: guys, I have a druid who's 4 levels from 70 and I just haven't brought myself to finish leveling him...please convince me to stop being lazy
[2:47:30] OMGWhatsHisFace: @ALLtheEXP switch to healer. insta queue tw. ez 70
[2:47:33] sourbutts: @ALLtheEXP no, continue to be lazy and useless, makes us look better
[2:47:45] ALLtheEXP: Wow, two ends of the spectrum there, thanks chat
[2:47:51] syrox_219: yeah cyclone is too strong it needs a cooldown like 10 sec or nerf the duration of it
[2:48:01] arcane_p: @sourbutts lol I know that's why I'm laughing
[2:48:51] ALLtheEXP: @OMGWhatsHisFace forgot about TW right now, ty i'm gonna do this
[2:48:53] ALLtheEXP: ez clap
[2:48:53] sourbutts: @syrox_219 if cyclone didnt make you immune and it could break like every other cc in  the game it would be fine
[2:49:09] syrox_219: or make it dispellable
[2:49:24] ALLtheEXP: nice ring!
[2:49:28] Flormaat: insane ring
[2:49:30] Bigmoran: That was a wizard beatdown at the end
[2:49:36] ZhangTuShi: HUH
[2:49:36] sourbutts: nice hoop
[2:49:40] arcane_p: that was masterful mage play
[2:49:45] brolic_9k: cyclone is fine
[2:49:52] higanheim: wizzid
[2:49:58] ALLtheEXP: Bigger the hoops, bigger the hoe @venruki
[2:50:14] ZhangTuShi: @havenblood definitely better than sheep. doesnt heal and cant be dispeled without md
[2:50:27] ZhangTuShi: doesnt break on damage either
[2:50:33] sourbutts: ice hoop
[2:50:37] zachgamegodx: if it was magic dispellable it would be a good change
[2:50:50] Jplague21: Master Shepherd makes it to where sheep doesn't heal btw
[2:51:26] zachgamegodx: @jplague21 no, it makes it so it doesn’t rapidly regen hp
[2:51:29] Jplague21: Still not as good as cyclone because cyclone prevents external healing as well
[2:51:34] zachgamegodx: the guy can still get healed…
[2:52:06] PromiscuousToilet: just give everyone all the same abilities with different names. then we can all complain about lack of game diversity again
[2:52:10] Jplague21: @zachgamegodx That's literally what I said

[4:26:29] SteLawBro: I'd make an argument pika might be one of the top 5 players in the game in general. Not sure how many people are cabable of getting glad on every spec.
[4:26:42] sethv805: nahj I get mixed feelings but he’s 2 and 3 on boards right now behind kalvish

[4:39:48] Kikrino: pog that was cool
[4:39:51] qkmood: what even happens when u duel in a duel
[4:39:59] rekt1370: dont think anything is beating outlaw arcane or even sub arcane

[4:45:14] Chris7ka: Now people are used to it, it's pretty easy to counter imo
[4:45:19] dankent130: impact stun for fire and blackout for spriest needs to make a comeback
[4:45:25] Magottx: @benutzernamelos you cant ask a frost mage if their ability is broken

[4:50:51] miirkatzy: shitting everywhere
[4:50:56] miirkatzy: usual chicken stuff
[4:50:59] NPBeharry: northrend = Canada
[4:51:08] narthiz: Most of them are raised in cafos
[4:51:11] smitesucks: im 2300 on my dps but i feel like im hardstuck 1700 on disc in solo cant believe they aren't nerfing rdruid
[4:51:12] thuglovex: “free range”
[4:51:14] TimeForged: free range is the other one
[4:51:19] arcane_p: does any of those things actually effect the taste of the egg?
[4:51:22] thuglovex: which means they get like 1ft each lmao
[4:51:25] narthiz: @arcane_p yes
[4:51:28] Magottx: it actually is so sad to think of all them chickens locked in a cage their life shittin eggs
[4:51:32] ALLtheEXP: @smitesucks I literally gave up on my disc earlier this week and i am like 1600
[4:51:44] bulgarian_beefer: eggs are eggs i just get the cheapest ones lol
[4:51:49] vozmozi: when i worked at a grocery store, a customer would always swap the best eggs into the cheap carton they got caught
[4:51:54] narthiz: @arcane_p I have chickens and I can tell you they 100% taste different when they're not commercially raised
[4:51:59] pugulus_prime: I'm not paying more so the food I eat has a bit of outside to walk around on.
[4:52:00] SteLawBro: I'd honestly eat ffake meat if i could. If the price was right and it tastes good. Im ready.

[4:54:12] Borngood: it's called a food desert
[4:54:13] narthiz: @venruki - exactly.  Class dynamics play a huge part in the conversation
[4:54:15] Xeliumimar: what stumps me is farmers cant sell meat to grocery stores, they sell to a middle man who then ups the price significantly to the grocery stores
[4:54:20] SteLawBro: Im lucky enough to live in aimish country so we get most of our veggies on the side of the road lol.
[4:54:22] narthiz: But that's a discussion for...not here - haha
[4:54:30] Kikrino: Ive become a cannibal cause of the food industry. Much easier to go out and just yoink someone then goin to the store.

[5:01:11] Chris7ka: wtf I didn't know that!!
[5:01:13] RedDragonKnight: it was dropped to 7/15 on ptr
[5:01:14] Chris7ka: That's enormous
[5:01:32] Blitzylive: is that why CDEW is only playing evoker now?
[5:01:45] kinnekswiss: you have the patch notes already, it’s 10/20
[5:01:48] RedDragonKnight: and its a multiplicative bonus, so its not 10-> 20, its 10->21. or not 15->30, but 15->32.25
[5:03:07] gothiquecat: Sorry for asking silly question chat. But who is the easiest class to pvp with in bgs and still do good? Im not very good at pvp.
[5:03:09] RedDragonKnight: yes
[5:03:21] seyvyur: each one is 10%, which is better than 20%
[5:03:23] tangell0s: @gothiquecat melee like warriors or boomies
[5:03:40] gothiquecat: thanks!
[5:03:50] Cocoapuffs1: the positional requirement on pres will always hinder it

[5:05:26] leeka: @venruki did you see this change? ROGUE Echoing Reprimand changes to Physical damage (was Arcane) and damage increased by 43% to account for armor.
[5:05:26] Chris7ka: where's Roxy!
[5:05:35] miirkatzy: warrior lock x ven!
[5:05:46] leeka: i wonder if itll hit cloth harder
[5:06:14] FinkleTheMage: I dislike changes around armor like that, the MM changes effected clothies the hardest
[5:06:15] PunishedLrnz: i think theres a pretty big nerf for pvp only on it right now
[5:06:15] Magottx: echo secret tech with 43% dam increasae seems insane
