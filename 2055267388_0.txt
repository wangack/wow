[2:21:10] hyruliaa: I just got Sea star and Coagulated on my holy priest, is there any other trinket i should consider that is insane for either dmg or healing in keys=?
[2:21:34] zachl_: @hyruliaa Leaf from everbloom or potentially voodoo totem, leaf prob more value for holy tho
[2:21:45] sim967: pip's maybe?
[2:22:40] sim967: voodoo is great on chromie
[2:23:02] Emm_Zee: Think it's a bit overrated on chromie
[2:23:09] hyruliaa: don`t think i do high enough dungeons to need those @zachl_  was thinking more towards dmg, see alot of healers use like belorelos and rageheart ect
[2:23:12] Emm_Zee: You can find spare globals to heal her on that fight
[2:23:27] sarpogne: how do you not get bored of only playing 1 role aka healer?
[2:23:29] Emm_Zee: Unless you're running oom
[2:23:52] hyruliaa: i usually just play tanks, but just picked up a holy priest after the buffs and kinda enjoy it
[2:23:53] zachl_: @hyruliaa tbh if its good at high levels, its good at low too, but you are typically right that double dam trinkets would be better!
[2:24:00] marcofellipe69: 🌙 🦂
[2:24:10] zachl_: tbh id play what u have /shrug cause star and blood help damage AND healing :)
[2:24:25] Emm_Zee: @hyruliaa Rageheart is incredibly difficult to get as a holy priest
[2:24:50] hyruliaa: i am struggeling to get Rageheart on my 5 tanks @Emm_Zee so i can see that xD
[2:25:18] marcofellipe69: eleventwo w
[2:25:19] simplepathwow: i wonder how much it goes for in a heroic sale
[2:25:21] sim967: tbf, I haven't switched my trinkets once I had coagulated to go with pip's, but I don't do dungeons as high as this crowd
[2:25:25] Emm_Zee: @hyruliaa Yeah and as priest you specifically need it traded to you so hope you got a lot of gold bud
[2:26:20] flockheart: xddPeat

[2:26:59] baseboned: maybe resto sham
[2:27:10] Visuals66: Stop, hes about to go non verbal Cryge
[2:27:12] baseboned: healing surge and healing wave kinda like flash heal and heal

[2:33:39] Cantwingrr: if its that off just aura buff all the stragglers
[2:33:53] zachl_: sooo many specs would be fixed with 5 more talent points
[2:34:03] zolal3: ye they must test new stuff more imo
[2:34:08] Emm_Zee: @zachl_ yeah like aug xdd
[2:34:24] mawji_: rsham with 5 more talent points would be sooooo good lol

[2:48:09] sim967: I mainly think of dpsing as something to do to save mana when dmg is reasonable
[2:48:12] nelis4224: not playing zen pulse?
[2:48:15] Galois_rg: healer dmg is about prio, if you're spinning on packs with a prio target, your overall will look better, but the key will be slower
[2:48:27] therealjuhbone: do you think they will beat the BFA AD time this year for MDI?
[2:48:38] njokkio: Spinning on big packs is just superior healing tbf
[2:48:48] Galois_rg: yeah but when you don't need big aoe healing
[2:48:49] goblingher: Are you having fun with the dps pug experience or is it pain for our entertainment?

[2:58:15] goblingher: @misterworldhide they play range healer mv build Despairge
[2:58:39] x_ANiMa: @goblingher i never understood why people do that. same with hPal.
[2:58:45] misterworldhide: castweaver xdd
[2:58:53] njokkio: Range mws in keys tilt me so hard
[2:59:19] goblingher: Had a tank beg the MV to atleast apply the monk debuff to the mobs in a +20 KEKW
[2:59:24] PrincessPuffyPants: What is the main reason for pulling all the trash first, before going for boss? To have time to reset big CD's?
[2:59:42] ubba90: @goblingher how the fuck is that even possible.
[2:59:52] Surplex_: I miss castweavwr when you could move with soothing mist that was fun
[3:00:19] x_ANiMa: castweavers dont attack @ubba90 they just stand there and channel soothing mist
[3:00:39] goblingher: @x_ANiMa like a true fucking GIGACHAD
[3:00:44] ubba90: @x_ANiMa but who does that in keys. lol
[3:00:46] Galois_rg: do some mistweavers really just cast in keys? idk if I believe this
[3:00:56] x_ANiMa: can we ban @goblingher
[3:01:10] augustmourns: @Galois_rg wym you dont know if you believe it, it happens all the time
[3:01:51] zachl_: @ubba90 you wouldnt believe how suboptimal people play : )))) ive seen a mw do 31k overall damage in a key
[3:02:04] zachl_: and all 31k (total damage) was his bramble barrier
[3:02:17] Galois_rg: pretzul's knowledge of ring of frost is so far above everyone's head, he can't explain it
[3:02:21] ubba90: @zachl_ ive seen me as a WW main do 60k over all as a MW but i only kick and punch
[3:02:21] x_ANiMa: and the worst part is if you ask these caster melee healers they just say because i want to when asked why they play a melee spec ranged
[3:02:27] trihart: regardless of spec, any healer that afk heals and doesnt press dps skills suck
[3:02:38] mynameis_Emil: classic mage behavior
[3:02:43] zachl_: @trihart based
[3:02:48] Blloood: why is growl playing with this random people instead of dorki
[3:02:52] zolal3: raid is more aids bc nobody can do the ramp

[3:45:14] Emm_Zee: You manatea -> rem -> soom -> envm -> slam vivify to build up 4pc healing
[3:45:17] soupdog55: spend the insta vivify to heal everyone with the renewing mist from enveloping mist
[3:45:41] Remery: @yumytv for most of bosses check haste celestial talent instead of sheilun. smolderon council is usually sheiluns choice
[3:45:52] kilhatv: mana tea reduces your mana cost on 50%
[3:46:00] Remery: yes, not right one
[3:46:07] Remery: all at the bottom

[3:49:08] Remery: too hard to cast shit there in melee, so just punch big angry lady
[3:49:53] flockheart: It's a busy night on Illidan. Gang Activity's main raid is entering hour FIFTEEN of their Tuesday OT Main raid. Spirits are at an all time low and Growl is dead, and in discord the cursed words have been spoken - "We're going till we kill it." We're monitoring the situation, but chances are the guild dies before the boss.

[3:54:56] AvalenaTV: Everbloom sesh PTSD
[3:55:02] Emm_Zee: @zachl_ What if gnarlroot is just a generic tree name
[3:55:07] Mjawwww: @zachl_ someone pulled him in everbloom, zoned out and kept running
[3:55:07] IAmSolari: @zachl_ idk it's a tree isn't it like his house
[3:55:20] zachl_: theres no way blizzard doesnt find some way to connect it right

[3:55:59] Remery: its just cause, you dont need to focus it
[3:56:00] IAmSolari: they should've just made the elite mob from EB the boss here with more swirlys
[3:56:07] Remery: sometimes jsut hardheal shit is useful
[3:56:21] Penwryn: @Emm_Zee Everbloom is witherbark. Gnarlroot is the tree from DHT
[3:56:28] xxpoperx: how to use that trinket ?
[3:56:30] Penwryn: Wait. That's Oaksomething
[3:56:35] Penwryn: I'm Chatting

[3:56:39] Remery: i member time it was 69hr cast FeelsBadMan
[3:56:42] xxpoperx: i mean how it works
[3:56:46] IAmSolari: @Penwryn Gnarlroot is the elite mob in EB
[3:56:48] Emm_Zee: Gnarlroot is the everbloom trash mob (that is harder than witherbark) xdd
[3:56:49] narwien1: @yumytv https://wago.io/ihFzqEaBP JSS wa, to show if its missing/out of range. Your WA pack is actually missing itXD
[3:56:50] zachl_: @Emm_Zee yalnu corrupted sol, sol opened up portal to sw, gnarlroot walks in, hes homies with us until amirdrassil ggg
[3:56:57] zachl_: thats the easy connection
[3:57:01] Penwryn: @IAmSolari You are 100% correct and I'm an idiot. My bad, holmes.
[3:57:18] Penwryn: There are a lot of Gnarlroots in this game, tbf.
[3:57:23] AvalenaTV: MDI?
[3:57:28] AvalenaTV: Spoilge
[3:57:29] IAmSolari: fuck yalnu
[3:57:44] Emm_Zee: Btw the DHT trinket is also called oakheart's gnarled root so oakheart is also gnarlroot ICANT
[3:57:55] AvalenaTV: growl is secretly practicing mdi offstream and surprises everyone!
[3:58:01] zachl_: yalnu needs to stop nerdmaxxing
[3:58:03] zachl_: fuck that boss

[4:03:21] Penwryn: @lambowarlock Looks like Ashes (smolderon on use) + something else.
[4:03:59] Penwryn: Augury has done the highest, branch has done the most.
[4:04:01] noldan216: How does one value IO vs money though?
[4:04:33] baseboned: make lots of money and then retire to play wow all day
[4:04:35] lapissuu: wideVIBE
[4:04:51] MierkaBlue: @noldan216 it is very hard to acquire io without electricity or net
[4:04:56] Remery: btw yulon usually used pre-damage basicaly to prehot 5 targets w enveloping and spread shit. then rsk to extend enveloping. better drink some tea anyway - this is heavily mana burning even with 50% off yulon stuff
[4:05:16] baseboned: do you need a sub? I'm 0/9 mythic

[4:18:13] Nonyamuff: @stylee__ that's it...thanks
[4:18:39] GrimFandango: @Remery this patch has so many trinkets that need WAs... Branch too, so cooked
[4:20:26] IAmSolari: Why does branch need a WA
[4:20:41] IAmSolari: Balefire or witherbark branch first of all
[4:21:10] GrimFandango: Witherbark
[4:21:20] GrimFandango: forgot there were multiple Branches this season LUL
[4:21:32] IAmSolari: I would suck igira's charred toes for the twisting blades myth trinket
[4:21:36] griggs929: @IAmSolari I would assume on Witherbark tto extend overall buff pick up 3rd orb before its about to expire
[4:21:39] IAmSolari: On my outlaw

[4:23:40] nightbreeze93: https://i.imgur.com/wCPkogY.png
[4:23:44] Remery: @yumytv ok last advice you (im being annoying, will go to sleep now) can still heal seedling after granting mastery buff - it just goes as smart heal and redirects it to whoever need it. so sooth+envelop on it is good
[4:23:56] GrimFandango: @nightbreeze93 @zachl_ explain yourself
[4:23:56] IAmSolari: @yumytv ok last advice you (im being annoying, will go to sleep now) can still heal seedling after granting mastery buff - it just goes as smart heal and redirects it to whoever need it. so sooth+envelop on it is good

[5:19:06] flutey_: who is in the military?

[5:24:05] baseboned: Student teaching was exhausting but good, I did some good work, had good support
[5:24:15] flutey_: band directors aren't paid nearly enough to be in a room full of children all doing something different
[5:24:25] Vyndrodis: how are all the music nerds in growls chat rn
[5:24:26] turretjustt: buh
[5:24:31] flutey_: you like it
[5:24:32] baseboned: but then the only job I could get was in the middle of nowhere armpit of arkansas by myself and tbh I just couldn't hack it
[5:24:34] Vyndrodis: im one of them
[5:24:48] Vyndrodis: Orchestra professional
[5:24:50] Silencbank: its cuz us music nerds tend to flock to the same places
[5:25:16] flutey_: truee - because we are the ones smart enough to play heals
[5:25:49] baseboned: they gave me 20 minutes twice a week to teach 6 grade beginners
[5:25:58] baseboned: like what can I even do
[5:26:12] baseboned: anyway enough of that
[5:26:14] Silencbank: can you even teach scales with that amount of time?
[5:26:21] flutey_: yeah you weren't set up for success. teaching music is so thankless and underpaid. i'm so glad i made it as a player
[5:26:24] Vyndrodis: Full band or lessons? so little time to wrangle those little fuckers
[5:26:55] baseboned: I had all brass together and all ww together and all percussion together
[5:26:57] FrabjousDaze: yumytvMetired

[5:27:13] Vyndrodis: @baseboned o7
[5:27:32] baseboned: but jfc teaching flute and sax at the same time as a trombon primary, I just felt bad
[5:27:46] baseboned: the kids deserved better
[5:27:59] flutey_: you just needed to give them a foundation. that's what private lessons are for
[5:29:52] baseboned: nymue is a fun fight I like it a lot
[5:31:54] Xaristar: I like it too, cool design but my guild is prog on it atm, so I'd rather be anywhere else

[5:43:46] StuntedScorpian: soooooI'm a new player to WoW, is classic or retail better? I've played ff14 but its a little too cat-like. WoW has always been on my radar but I feel like it might be too late
[5:45:04] IAmSolari: @StuntedScorpian both are good
[5:46:09] ShabsieAU: @StuntedScorpian classic is easier, better leveling experience, more 'rpg'
[5:46:33] ShabsieAU: retail is better end game, gameplay, but less rpg and more 'gameified'
[5:46:38] baseboned: the good news is that you can try both for free, and the game time gives you access to both, you dont have to pick, just try them
[5:47:16] IAmSolari: classic is about the journey, retail is about the destination
[5:49:43] Vyerre: just watched your yt video. Was good information ty
[5:50:17] OrganicPasta: SoD

[6:33:59] battleskaar: shoulda played disc priest instead
[6:34:00] Remery: @Remery that is also true, but seing this oneshot is still strange

[6:34:56] m_dep: wait are they back together?
[6:34:59] m_dep: oh no jpc
[6:35:06] samaxis: Honest question, what do people want to be the barrier from being able to complete the highest keys? Do do you want it to be unkillable or be to much damage?
[6:35:07] Tocketimer: just got my first season with a 2k healer (druid)
[6:35:10] imjebb: the hangry elle RAGEY
[6:35:24] khebul: Well, regarding the season - what are the options? It is either one shots or not enough damage to time it
[6:35:40] Gatobekittenme: i thought jpc not playing was a joke at first
[6:35:42] Rampo123: i mean jpc hasn't been playing since he joined world first
[6:36:06] emnitthy: @khebul not enough dps is 10000% better

[6:36:55] yctnm: does anyone like m+ healers
[6:37:10] baseboned: I think if you're not playing in MDI or TGP calling your team a name is kinda funny, like giving yourself a nickname
[6:37:14] Surefirexp: like imagine playing with Dorkis OP healer
[6:37:21] turretjustt: xdd
[6:37:24] Theliahh: the triple shard incident
[6:37:31] dknamey: at least now you can finish your zero to hero
