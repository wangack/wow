[2:17:46] eceria: yes, start with last expansion
[2:17:48] Vashthalas: Prob just play the game with a basic sub, level and see how you like it imo
[2:17:57] ZlNNUREYN: dragon flight too overloaded imho, stick to classic, enjoy ur time leveling
[2:18:11] eceria: im playing since 2005, i'd start with Dragonflight
[2:18:13] TinySp00k: yes, buy Dragonflight you get the War Within and a boost, too
[2:18:18] hanncae: I am not sure :) I am overwhelmed with the ongoing story. Thank you

[2:18:38] vi7aka1: true

[2:19:05] StreamElements: https://era.raider.io/characters/us/crusader-strike/Psher%C3%B5

[2:19:27] Frantixofficial: good morning cheesebags
[2:19:31] rainlel: @bassiemon123 with next phase?
[2:19:32] Seline88: Classic is more slow-paced compared to retail
[2:19:41] bassiemon123: @frantixofficial ill take that as a compliment <3
[2:19:44] screwu666: he has idea if he has eyes and he can read
[2:19:47] Vashthalas: yeah, retail is very streamlined
[2:19:47] bassiemon123: @rainlel myess
[2:19:58] Qrazzlof: so? i dont want information
[2:20:00] screwu666: classic provides enough information if you have eyes to read
[2:20:20] Frantixofficial: @bassiemon123 good let the cheese flow through you
[2:20:24] screwu666: there are plenty of quests who gonna send you down stonetalon and what ashenvale and so on
[2:20:38] chiefwilliams: I just met a new player on classic yesterday and had no idea weapon masters could train to use diff weapons. felt bad so bought him a set of greens off the AH, he was level 17 in grays and greens with the wrong stats
[2:20:41] Vashthalas: KEKW
[2:20:56] rainlel: its exploration
[2:21:02] screwu666: it is generally written in which geographical direction the objective is
[2:21:06] TinySp00k: but he was right about the lore tho. if you never played WoW the story is a convoluted mess
[2:21:08] SumBodyFarted: that was the best way to explain that ever lmao

[2:21:20] PexLoad: LUL
[2:21:22] ZlNNUREYN: retail = taking u by the hand for everything, classic = gotta do investigation by ur own, youtube is nice for it. depends on the person and own preference
