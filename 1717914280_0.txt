[1:21:03] LoseAlotLuke: staysw sane @TheUnbalancedOne
[1:21:05] LoseAlotLuke: same
[1:21:13] rosina_scarlett: you can afk at the portals then you just have to help kill the boss takes 30 mins to an hour
[1:21:18] Senthius09: have to cap 4 points then kill boss, enemies can retake points too
[1:21:18] jerexify: Oh, the new primal storm stuff is awful.
[1:21:22] Molvonos: After the portals you gotta kill a boss that has more HP than anything that has a right to be an outdoor boss.
[1:21:27] trx_ice: < I got nothing from it lol
[1:21:31] ClassicMalcontent: 4 portals to close and takes time for groups to close those then the boss took time to kill. Big shield adds. Lots of HP to chew through.
[1:21:47] zodd_amhai: i really dont like thundering affix
[1:21:57] ClassicMalcontent: @mwcliipz no gear but it's 'the other stuff' as usual. Same but still whatever else.
[1:22:00] rosina_scarlett: yeah.. the the boss in the primal storm has more HP then Mythic Rasz @Towelliee
[1:22:25] ClassicMalcontent: It was 4 portals. Had to defend them to keep them closed before the boss.
[1:22:26] ashwing_: 220M HP
[1:22:27] rosina_scarlett: idk
[1:22:27] mavericks312: think of arathi basin point swapping lol
[1:22:28] RiskySaber: @Towelliee Can you make crafted gear with spark to tier gear ?
[1:22:41] Armdel: atleast there's 100 people fighting it
[1:22:42] rosina_scarlett: less then mythic rasz but still to much
[1:22:45] mrizzle12: It scales with number of people attacking it
[1:22:45] Zerkness: what is the command to see all the addons he uses?
[1:22:46] Gingerprimer: @RiskySaber nope
[1:22:47] Armdel: or was when i did it
[1:22:47] mavericks312: no you cannot make crafted gear into tier
[1:22:56] Strik3r019: thats because people r hiting it in a raid and the quest can only be done as a 5 man, its a 13mil hp boss with a 5man
[1:23:20] ClassicMalcontent: Glad I never focused on gear crafting.
[1:23:37] Zerkness: !adv

[2:39:10] Shaele: 40 rage for that much dmg for only 5 targets is not worth it

[2:39:30] dragonhunter11698: have you done a tank run on a warrior before?

[2:44:33] visaeris412: is it just me or has pugging gotten worse as the weeks have gone on?
[2:44:39] Aegllor: Chaos definitely. It’ll be a catch up. But the focuses should not be account wide but nerfed to needing 5 instead of 10

[2:49:04] dreamwalker213: I love how easy it is to finish catalyst quest

[2:50:11] GodKingMuninn: back in my day bears pulverized
[2:50:57] smashwow: back in my day bears shit in the woods not on charts Kappa
[2:50:58] roac: that's not TnC, that's a maul modifier.
[2:50:59] Moobot:  Check out Towelliee's YouTube channel! You can view the most recent uploaded video HERE || WoW Patch 10.0.5 | Class tuning and New Features youtu.be/86X4M9bLKQk
[2:51:36] thebakeriscomingforu: pulverize just never felt good to press
[2:51:49] roac: not sure, each stack increased maul damage is what you were seeing
[2:51:52] ChildishAnbu: how does bear feel with the new patch?
[2:52:06] Ezekyler: the same
[2:52:24] NBK_Sethus: bear pretty much the same, brewmaster on the other hand stupid op
[2:52:26] thebakeriscomingforu: Probably the same but now with typhoon
[2:52:28] Uutef: taking new stuff in the class tree
[2:52:37] j_bar111: Do you remember power auras before weak auras was a thing? @Towelliee
[2:52:44] jjwoodard10: thrash spam being gone during incarn feels a little bad
[2:53:04] smashwow: didn't they make the tree more defensive or offensive focused? meaning you can't blend them like before?
[2:53:49] jjwoodard10: thrash mangle thrash mangle maul on tc proc
[2:53:55] MFAM_THE_Steven: thought the world ended when i couldnt spam thrash lol
[2:54:40] jjwoodard10: @smashwow tree changes made it so you could get earthwarden easier but people arent taking it cause it takes away maul talents
[2:54:53] MFAM_THE_Steven: Bear tanking felt pointless after that lmao
[2:55:39] Rudric_Ice: bears back ?
[2:55:58] Friiz_The_Gamer: weakauras companion app....get that
[2:56:03] j_bar111: Maybe spell id changed
[2:56:33] Maydie6066: @Towelliee so Raze is an interesting talent with Tooth/Claw
[2:56:41] Maydie6066: since it applies the debuff to all targets hit
[2:57:06] jjwoodard10: @Maydie6066 it doesnt apply to all targets unless they changed it
[2:57:21] Incredible_Sausage: morning all! anything good from the vault?
[2:58:03] Incredible_Sausage: nice!
[2:58:30] hammack52: i had to take the currency this week

[2:58:33] LoseAlotLuke: I heard avenging crusader is kinda nuts on holy paladin now
[2:58:38] ThePawPaw: RIP servers :(
[2:58:39] zinbers: There was a update on most weakaura last night plus when you tried to do dungeons things got hairy in you would get kicked out of the server on top of if you use elvui you would not see any of your actions bar either
[2:58:46] PvtHudson093: is it right that you only get 1 catalyst charge per character?
[2:58:58] Qelvue: wait, what ilvl was that and from what? :P
[2:59:13] holytager: why is servers shutting down?
[2:59:14] Ryvden: each week
[2:59:18] jjwoodard10: @Towelliee the problem with raze from ptr was that raze wasnt getting any damage boost from talent tree for increased physical damage because raze wasnt classifed as a druid spell. also raze was applying the damage reduction to only one random target instead of everything it hits
[2:59:22] adam6683: 6 total
[2:59:25] shepdogg287: hey does anyone else have a problem with your skill bars not showing up
[2:59:26] inj0shwetrust: one charger per toon per acct on a weekly reset
[2:59:31] PvtHudson093: then i am annoyed that it came out 2 weeks to late
[2:59:37] inj0shwetrust: tbh thats really nice
[2:59:40] dimofodi: After updating in game, there's a delay with the application showing you're updated.
[3:00:16] zinbers: Dalaran
[3:00:25] zinbers: And I think others
[3:00:32] KurtyQ: sweet transmogs

[3:01:10] GeneralHooHaa: I've been raiding for 4 weeks and have only gotten gloves
[3:01:18] ClassicMalcontent: Oh boy next mini-patch to the patch downloading on the Bnet client
[3:01:21] zinbers: Yes  they did a update
[3:01:25] chriswrites: if you already have a 4 piece, cant you use it to tier set pvp gear to become op in arenas?
[3:01:28] shepdogg287: @Tac2cul2 ok ya i am, ty
[3:01:32] Friiz_The_Gamer: Did brewmaster get any buffs?
[3:01:32] its_hekks: @Towelliee i cant even find the quest line for the free teir
[3:01:35] Timozuna: i havent even started a good chunk of alts
[3:01:35] JustSalvation: should the revival catalyst quest gain progress in dungeons and shit?
[3:01:39] Heero_Effect: sionzGnome
[3:01:41] GeneralHooHaa: that's what I'm saying. I still need it so I don't think it's too late
[3:01:44] ClassicMalcontent: WoW Retail is patching again.
[3:01:44] Mecabeast: half my raid is evoker/monk and I'm a warrior so no tier for me lol
[3:01:54] GodKingMuninn: oh boy people gonna lose m+ rating next week, can't wait to see this shit show.
[3:01:54] Moobot:  Help Towelliee reach the 1,000,000 followers goal. Click that heart button and join the Hammer Squad community!
[3:01:55] PvtHudson093: would it kill them to give us 2 charges to start with
[3:01:57] zinbers: I am still leveling my toon plus I need to gear all my tanks
[3:02:00] RipcordTV: @Towelliee ive been stuck at 2600 i havent got any teir gear in 3 weeks
[3:02:00] Malarick: got my 3rd piece from the vault.  Im an LFR scrub but I have 3 pieces lol
[3:02:19] zinbers: Do that
[3:02:24] Heero_Effect: @malarick eh nothing wrong with LFR
[3:02:40] kowaikokoro: untimed rating lowered PepeLaugh
[3:02:42] GodKingMuninn: They're making changes to untimed keys
[3:02:46] mayonaes: My buddy downloaded the dev build of elvui to fix his
[3:02:47] ClassicMalcontent: @Malarick nice. I aspire to be even an LFR scrub I'm so casual AF in DF currently. Kappa
[3:02:50] zinbers: Update elvui folder it would be a buggy mess
[3:02:51] NiteshadezTV: The people who got bonus rating from the depleted 20+ will be set as if it was a level 20
[3:02:55] heltvild: untimed keys changes
[3:02:58] flyingmachin3: are they talking about 21+ overtime
[3:03:07] NBK_Sethus: no one is losing rating dont spread false information
[3:03:19] natevic: untimed keys were giving more rating than intended
[3:03:20] snake_like: doesn't matter if you haven't done keys above 20
[3:03:24] Qelvue: +21 and up will give score equal to a +20 if not done on time
[3:03:24] mavericks312: how many ppl are actually doing 20_
[3:03:25] dimofodi: No one is losing rating
[3:03:36] darkwaves: wowhead article on it
[3:03:42] Sayryn: https://www.wowhead.com/news/score-awarded-from-depleted-mythic-keystones-over-20-significantly-nerfed-in-331144?fbclid=IwAR0ZhtXq60lDjQMaIhQfCxDrZg9uNbkKfp4Dwg6Uxgt-Koiw22vNuI0N5U8
[3:03:51] smashwow: ooof
[3:03:55] citrinesoan: hmm, well, im not sure about EU...
[3:04:05] dimofodi: They're misunderstanding the situation where Blizz is making keys over 20 give a lot of rating for depleting.
[3:04:12] ClassicMalcontent: Anything above M+20 that is depleted is considered +20. Which impacts me NOT AT ALL. Ha.
[3:04:24] looney199725: pretty much
[3:04:27] looney199725: most 3k players
[3:04:29] looney199725: have all depelres
[3:04:31] looney199725: there not gd
[3:04:36] looney199725: there just gettin score for failin
[3:04:43] kowaikokoro: good change for the rank 1 push, irrelevant for most players
[3:04:49] heltvild: yes
[3:04:54] ClassicMalcontent: Seems so.
[3:04:55] looney199725: only
[3:04:57] dimofodi: Interesting!
[3:04:57] Allvarez: i like it
[3:05:00] looney199725: if ur boosted by all depeltes
[3:05:01] Solarwings: if you dont time the key
[3:05:01] heltvild: if you have untimed 22 for example it will count as a timed 20 i guess
[3:05:01] Foxdoabarrelrofl: yes if your rating was 2400 bc of a depleted key
[3:05:04] Foxdoabarrelrofl: you will drop
[3:05:06] Korgo90: So nothing about leavers just losing rating for completing dungeons
[3:05:09] Korgo90: Real Smart Blizz
[3:05:11] fewyn: sounds like they are recalcing the entire ratings
[3:05:11] Qelvue: the scoring will be retroactive yep
[3:05:12] Allvarez: seems cheesy getting high rating for failing
[3:05:20] GodKingMuninn: Yeah, you could lose some rating; its not a major issue but the whole taking rating will not sit well with some peeps lol
[3:05:22] looney199725: alot of 3k players
[3:05:25] looney199725: have all depelte score
[3:05:26] heltvild: to stop boosters from selling high untimed keys
[3:05:27] Snabido: @Korgo90 PJSalt
[3:05:28] Thoreya: @Korgo90 they aint gonna do shit for leavers, and thank god
[3:05:29] looney199725: so they will lose like 200 rating
[3:05:33] GodKingMuninn: The tears are glorious
[3:05:34] GriFFFoN_ZGZ: server shutdown?
[3:05:37] GriFFFoN_ZGZ: xd
[3:05:45] Thoreya: reddit comments on r/competitivewow seem fine about it
[3:05:46] its_hekks: @how do i make a set piece?
[3:05:49] Foxdoabarrelrofl: anyone gotten a bottled essence drop yet?
[3:05:49] LoremasterMarthan: If you are already doing 20+ keys, is the rating that big of a deal?
[3:05:51] Allvarez: yes
[3:05:53] Allvarez: fuck em
[3:05:54] looney199725: no
[3:06:01] its_hekks: @Towelliee how do i make a set piece?
[3:06:01] warn1ng: Illidan servers going down in 7min
[3:06:01] Moobot:  ADV Sponsor - https://advanced.gg/pages/partner-towelliee?ref=towelliee | "TOWEL" AT CHECKOUT for 25% OFF UNTIL FRIDAY| ADVANCED® makes the most trusted focus drinks & supplements for gaming! |
[3:06:01] looney199725: it effects top end players who are farming score for depeltes
[3:06:08] looney199725: theres alot of 3k players with mostly all failed keys
[3:06:17] GodKingMuninn: it effects everyone doing 20+ atleast in some way
[3:06:19] looney199725: now they will drop to like 2.8k
[3:06:21] Maydie6066: @Towelliee  just did some testin on the dummies of Raze s Maul (Sacrificing Elunes Favoured talent). ST Raze is severly undervalued, but against a pack of 5, Raze was nearly triple the Maul damage. all were with 3 stacks of Vicious Cycle and Tooth/Claw. for Dungeons and Cleave fights i could see Raze being worth it for both damage and defensive
[3:06:26] Thoreya: for top score
[3:06:30] Ertra: because right now you get a ton of score for it
[3:06:30] Teriyakibro: HYPERS I guess
[3:06:31] looney199725: its cuz they want 0.1% title
[3:06:32] its_hekks: higher score
[3:06:35] looney199725: if they got the score they dont care
[3:06:37] Allvarez: it makes the 3k rating "more real"
[3:06:44] heltvild: just for high score ladders
[3:06:55] smashwow: yeah because a 24 untimed within 20% of the timer is currently giving io as if they completed in time
[3:07:07] looney199725: yes
[3:07:08] heltvild: yes their score will count as a 20 then
[3:07:13] looney199725: so it stops the cheesing the 0.1% title
[3:07:24] mavericks312: its a good change
[3:07:42] looney199725: its a giga change
[3:07:47] looney199725: ul see so many ppl drop score
[3:07:54] looney199725: most these 3k players will drop to 2.8k
[3:07:57] j_bar111: above 20 ithink
[3:07:59] NiteshadezTV: the people who gained rating from it will lose the rating they gained from it.
[3:08:00] heltvild: some top players have a lot of untimed like 25 keys etc so guess they will go down a bit in rating
[3:08:00] grumpyunclecritter: Yay server shut down
[3:08:01] RageerPLZ: nah rigth away since the change
[3:08:02] illusion1990: only the on the reset if you have untimeed keys those score will change
[3:08:08] kowaikokoro: rating will get adjusted is my guess
[3:08:08] Elizare: the only way people are going down is when the change is implemented
[3:08:09] smashwow: you will "lose" rating next week when they push this
[3:08:16] Twodogs25: Missed 21+ partial rating will be rerated as a missed 20 key
[3:08:16] snake_like: if you have an untimed key above a 20 those dungeons return to a timed 20 rating
[3:08:17] Qelvue: @Towelliee it's of they already sitting on score from depleted keys
[3:08:17] chriswrites: i think the losing rating comes from when they implement the change, but not afterwards
[3:08:18] dimofodi: No, people who already did it may go down in score from adjustments. You won't lose in future keys, they're adjusting existing scores.
[3:08:22] HaxzorJimDuggan: its a retroactive change from what it sounds like
[3:08:24] looney199725: another words if u want 3k+ score
[3:08:26] smashwow: becasuse all the depletes will drop to a 20+ io
[3:08:30] looney199725: start timing ur keys not farming depeltes
[3:08:32] JordoOCE: People that currently have IO only due to having completed (but not in time) +22s to +25s will lose rating as the rating will appear as if they have only timed a +20
[3:08:34] WoW_StandalonE: roll back
[3:08:50] looney199725: its not that bad
[3:08:51] Uglyfoot: you will only lose rating when the change happens, you can fail all you want after that, you just wont get the rating @Towelliee
[3:08:52] brooklynitetv: fking server shutdown DESTROYED MY KEY
[3:08:56] looney199725: 0.1% rn isnt that bad
[3:08:58] looney199725: its like 2940
[3:09:00] looney199725: for the title rn
[3:09:07] SauceFu: It reads to me as if they are going to recalculate everyones score next week based on their previous results, this will likely result in some players losing rating with the recalculation
[3:09:13] looney199725: ye
[3:09:14] looney199725: thats it

[3:09:26] heltvild: @SauceFu correct
[3:09:30] Ertra: @brooklynitetv i mean the message is on the launcher and on the character select screen, since 0300am est
[3:09:32] artiBEAST: probably someone got mad when they were wondering why someone was above them on the leaderboard and saw they had 4-5 depleted keys giving more io than a times key 1-2 levels below
[3:09:51] its_hekks: i mean all 2 people are devistated
[3:09:59] adam6683: Should be a toon that can benefit from the 389 no?
[3:10:01] c0mmander_starscream: INB4 the reees "Where's my classic Draenor"!!!!
[3:10:04] smashwow: yeah blizz fired the head dude of classic LUL
[3:10:10] dreamwalker213: People are doing hardcore on classic era atm
[3:10:11] smashwow: classic ded inc
[3:10:26] Thoreya: everyone is replaceable
[3:10:35] c0mmander_starscream: There's going to be a lot of firings before the merger is complete
[3:10:43] its_hekks: @smashwow blizzard didnt fire him? dude you are fake news galore
[3:10:46] Thoreya: but he didnt allow lfd in wrath sadge
[3:10:47] smashwow: tbf i respect that man.
[3:10:55] its_hekks: @smashwow he left and it had nothing to do with wow
[3:11:06] smashwow: @its_hekks oh yes they did. he even posed about it
[3:11:09] brooklynitetv: What are they doing with server shutdown that they had to do unscheduled maintenance for?
[3:11:20] smashwow: he left because of the evals
[3:11:20] brooklynitetv: And ruin my timed +16
[3:11:25] kokochris: @its_hekks exactly he was upset ab out a terrible employee performance evaluation they do.
[3:11:32] its_hekks: @smashwow he left because he didnt want to give someone on his team a 3 review
[3:11:32] mavericks312: cutback season to make positive revenue
[3:11:37] smashwow: well was fired because he refused to do evals the way they wanted
[3:11:48] LoremasterMarthan: Also incoming Recession. All of the Tech industry is dealing with it right now. Im in Print Production and we have layoffs happening too
[3:11:52] Heero_Effect: Yeah corporate sucks
[3:11:57] Thoreya: 10k
[3:11:59] Maydie6066: is EU down for weekly reset? is Tow about to be out of WoW options to keep playing Kappa
[3:12:01] Molvonos: @brooklynitetv Its not unscheduled.  It was on the launcher for a while.
[3:12:02] EmpathyLiveChat: Yes, it's also the time of year when some employees are thinking of leaving anyway, so it's all change.
[3:12:03] heltvild: 10k
[3:12:05] xXSiebzehnXx: why are teh servers being shutdown?
[3:12:06] Forestrunner201: 10,000 by March
[3:12:12] Thoreya: every big tech company is going thru it
[3:12:19] Storm1854: its just an hour
[3:12:20] Thoreya: theyll bounce back by next year tho
[3:12:26] tatertotpauls: day 2 of maintenance
[3:12:29] Betrys: a friend of mine was laid off from 343 cause of that whole situatio
[3:12:30] BowSec: actually around 30k people laid off from microsoft
[3:12:34] sgreth: Those layoffs were to help offset the huge investment in OpenAI. MechaRobot
[3:12:43] its_hekks: @smashwow and if you had a real job you would know why what bilizzard is doing is absolute shjit.... say everyone on your team are top performers... you HAD to give someone a 3 which means LOWER stock rewards and bonus
[3:12:46] Elijahss: there were a few bugs that came with 10.0.5
[3:12:47] EmpathyLiveChat: they tuk our jerbs
[3:12:54] Thoreya: ya ofc
[3:12:56] kokochris: There is a reason why its happening right now.  There is a potential recession coming, they want cash on hand.  this is an unfortunate thing though; but times are going to be tough over the next 1-2 years.
[3:12:56] audrock7: Yeah hopefully they fix the catalyst which removes sockets 😐
[3:13:20] Doohzyy: more downtime Pog
[3:13:51] Frosty1u1: hey hope your having  a great morning!
[3:13:57] smashwow: @its_hekks and apparently you didn't read where i said i respected the dudes stance. how about you calm down with the "if you had a job" comments. i'm very familiar with how corps work.
[3:14:01] Calibur84: So can you only get 1 catayst a week kinda deal?
[3:14:02] Sazuret: Yeah random shutdown
[3:14:04] Sazuret: Sadge

[3:15:23] Calibur84: tool tip is wrong
[3:15:23] Molvonos: UI error prolly
[3:15:24] S7ORM_: @towelliee would you trade this years first round pick for Aaron Rodgers?
[3:15:30] Sazuret: Yeah sims had an error for my boy earlier said +13k dps
[3:15:33] gimmlay: ya the I was trying to upgrade a pvp piece and it wouldn't go through
[3:15:33] EclipserEU: upgrade to downgrade lmao
[3:15:35] Karbonn: yea but it says +11 agility still
[3:15:36] Sazuret: When it was +130 dps
[3:15:44] Karbonn: so it looks like a coding error in the number
[3:15:46] its_hekks: @Towelliee why is there no quest popup right when the patch started for the catalyst quest?
[3:16:02] Sourpickle1366: Sourpickle1366 subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 5 months! 
[3:16:08] xghostyyx: Good morning Towel guess we are in the waiting room today hahah
[3:16:08] omahadadgames: Strife tokens werent being taken when upgrading also...so you could upgrade unlimitedly if you had a high enough count
[3:16:14] TeejayOCE: really? I always just copy over it
[3:16:17] pigzip: @towelliee  try use if wowup.
[3:16:17] gylogan: its just a visual bug i upgraded a warmode piece and it was saying pvp ilvl of 476 but when i converted it it was normal
[3:16:43] Frosty1u1: so do you only get one charge across all charaters for the week or one for each
[3:17:04] Thoreya: wowup is dope glad they brought it back
[3:17:10] Heero_Effect: ;)
[3:17:19] Thoreya: ya
[3:17:22] its_hekks: yes
[3:17:24] tiyanigean: @Frosty1u1 one each
[3:17:25] its_hekks: they made a deal
[3:17:26] Thoreya: lightweight too
[3:17:28] HaxzorJimDuggan: there is a curseforge version of wowup now
[3:17:28] smashwow: did they fix wowup's access to all the APIs?
[3:17:33] khrovaa: oh shit really
[3:17:33] PloppinTurdz: i dont think they want the catalyst to be something you really "look forward to" per say, rather it gets you up to speed with the player base after not getting your tier 2 months in
[3:17:33] Elizare: elvui has their own app that can update all of their versions for whatever wow type/version
[3:17:37] xghostyyx: It's ironic because WoW is never up haha
[3:17:38] Incredible_Sausage: i went back to curseforge from wowup because WU wasn't updating shit
[3:17:39] Sazuret: Curseforge had 8 more updates so ill believe it
[3:17:49] fewyn: you have to download a seperate wowup version for curseforge
[3:17:51] khrovaa: yeah i use tukui installer for elvui
[3:17:54] fewyn: https://wowup.io/
[3:17:58] Stoops21: they have a wowup curseforge beta...even updates elvui
[3:17:59] fewyn: it's on the right side
[3:18:02] sphynx_rayne: elvui is so broke for me. XD

[3:18:33] khrovaa: yeah i swapped to default bars, only using elvui for 1 thing LOL
[3:18:37] Karbonn: WoW is still not as broken as Destiny 2 though. D2 been offline for almost 24 hours due to major issues abd rollbacks.
[3:18:38] PloppinTurdz: yea thats true, 6 weeks in for 1 charge is wack. agreed
[3:18:39] looney199725: it was to late tbh
[3:18:49] RealSlurpycup: that 1 charge carries over to ur alts as well
[3:19:09] its_hekks: @Towelliee i just run normals and dont invite others on my token.... ez
[3:19:11] Sazuret: Too late for the catalyst tbh
[3:19:15] Valzark: meh my 4set not that great anyway
[3:19:17] hooliggan: It should of been released with the last wing of LFR if anything
[3:19:33] barrowzz: @hooliggan this
[3:19:36] MrsPyra: @RealSlurpycup if i use the charge is it used or still available to my alts too?
[3:19:38] Sylphy_TV: towComfy

[3:19:53] smashwow: all hunters are squishy really
[3:19:58] Neounited7: should make a new tank class :P
[3:19:59] RealSlurpycup: @RealSlurpycup have one on alt too
[3:20:04] Sazuret: Survival hunters were ruined since the release of xpac lul
[3:20:07] Neounited7: it*
[3:20:09] CeruleanStar: we had ~15 deaths in a 17HOV we timed ~20s left
[3:20:10] MrsPyra: ty
[3:20:11] looney199725: av is dogshit
[3:20:12] jure__: ofcs, its been that way forever and theres nothing being done about it
[3:20:13] looney199725: so is temple
[3:20:19] Klarynse: yup pretty squish
[3:20:28] Mecabeast: hunters in general don't have the greatest defensive for constant aoe or often spike dmg
[3:20:38] dreamwalker213: HOV charges help. Max timed a 20 last night with 25 deaths
[3:20:38] irvingxander: ayo towellie how long is thr maintenance
[3:20:42] dreamwalker213: Changes*
[3:20:42] heltvild: hov should be easier now after nerfs
[3:20:45] Shuttlelol: shadowmoon is so discounted from the rest of the instances, its so jarring
[3:20:46] NVbrutal: its cause the spawn point in cos puts you right back in the fight the other dungeons just have to long of run backs in between wipes
[3:20:47] barrowzz: yeah one wipe on HOV its bad. Plus the RP. They need to change the spawn points in HOV after you kill certain bosses
[3:20:53] StreamElements: Use code POGTOWEL120 for $120 off at https://strms.net/TowellieeFactorMarBot #ad
[3:20:59] Shuttlelol: disconnected*
[3:21:14] slaughtp: I will say as a fairly casual player this expansion has made a few things feel very confusing.. I still don't feel like I know how to properly handle professions, what these new charges are, or anything like that.

[3:23:09] Mecabeast: we just got to dathea
[3:23:10] NVbrutal: happened to everyone i think happened to my guild on malganis
[3:23:21] gzus81: we had it on thrall, called raid early after m terros

[3:23:56] Mecabeast: we spent like an hour on kurog cause we downed him first time last week
[3:23:58] amayaraven: @NVbrutal  i got dc from a 16 cause of that and it kick from the group luck i was able to get back in and still time it it was crazy

[3:25:56] sinlesssinner: question for chat, i am a holy paladin, is Ruby Welp Shell worth it as a trinket?
[3:26:18] Molvonos: Do you use haste or crit as a main secondary stat?
[3:26:51] sinlesssinner: haste
[3:27:03] Molvonos: Then yes, but only if you don't have anything better
[3:27:22] sinlesssinner: ilvl wise i dont
[3:27:26] watchthemgrow: gotta train the whelpling too i believe
[3:27:35] sinlesssinner: but i am using pure haste trinket from pvp 395 vs 402 for shell
[3:27:48] Molvonos: Yea, you def need to train the whelp for it to be useful
[3:28:07] watchthemgrow: shell will ultimately be better once trained i bet
[3:28:22] Molvonos: There's still a fair amount of RNG with the whelp, even when fully trained

[3:32:53] Oldduketree007: NA realms down again? O_o
[3:32:59] GodKingMuninn: add an ony pawprint in like a little mold as a bonus?
[3:33:02] Dionaut: AH okay, So how you liking the new beast ? You enjoying that 4k ?
[3:33:32] kokochris: 1440p still best imho
[3:33:44] Mecabeast: did you see the system requirements needed for that new forspoken game?
[3:33:44] ForeverCarried: So @Towelliee I know you play all the tanks, Whats your thoughts on Brewmaster currently?
[3:33:51] wEiRdO_dUdE: Servers are up!!
[3:33:53] Dionaut: Yea, I get yea. The way tech comes out. If you kept up. You would be updating almost weekly lol

[3:34:14] Dionaut: Holy cow. 1-8 ads ....
[3:34:14] dreamwalker213: Hey chat what would be the most beneficial thing to upgrade first in my pc to fix some fps issues?
[3:34:22] smileyfrown: i went to sleep early yesterday what time did the maintenance finally end?
[3:34:26] Calibur84: Rip my MM hunter lol
[3:34:37] wEiRdO_dUdE: I still run 1440p, too. It's good
[3:34:40] TexasPower: MUH DOUBLE TAP
[3:34:49] Dionaut: Graphics card, Ram, Storage, Mother board, power source. ect.
[3:35:44] itsagentscully: MM hunters honestly still aren't bad. the 10% of rapid fire and aimed shot over the span of a dungeon is noticeable as well as being able to take double kill shot.
[3:35:47] wEiRdO_dUdE: I think they said the storm is on a big rotation
[3:35:52] majestictaco0: i had that storm last night but it had 4 hours left
[3:35:54] majestictaco0: i think it moves
[3:36:05] ashwing_: you wont get enough currency to get the ring i thik
[3:36:05] CaptnPawPaws: Storm shows up as a purple icon just like the world boss
[3:36:06] BowSec: every 5 hours right
[3:36:12] pereadin: good mornin fam
[3:36:14] ashwing_: i did it ot 4 chars and each got 25 of the shit
[3:36:16] Gattaqua: @itsagentscully burst potential drops like crazy though... that's the main reason!

[3:36:43] Kaydwen: mine is 13/23 ingame
[3:36:47] Lokajin: have u tried using the tukui app?
[3:36:47] ClassicMalcontent: @Vluggedaafie good to know. So 4 hours up. 1 hour no storm.
[3:36:54] Lokajin: It worked for me once i used there client to update it
[3:36:57] itsagentscully: @itsagentscully I play a hunter in the top .5% and I can tell you the burst profile may have gone down but im doing more overall now.

[3:37:21] ClassicMalcontent: I'm using the WoWUP with CF (Beta) working well so far.
[3:37:35] Dionaut: @dreamwalker213 ment in that order. SO go with your graphics card first, then your ram, ect.
[3:38:01] Ambiidextrous_: im torn between manic grieftorch and my 3rd setpiece from vault FeelsBadMan
[3:38:24] Lokajin: but you can 4p off the catalyst
[3:38:25] wEiRdO_dUdE: EZ update
[3:38:32] Masqerader: and u can craft 4pc eventually
[3:38:33] Lokajin: so its a valid hmmmmm conundrum
[3:38:35] NBK_Sethus: LUL
[3:38:41] PetroDragonic: towel u try mage tower yet?
[3:38:41] Moobot: Towelliee is rocking the new Logitech Sona Mic! Check it out at https://imp.i125364.net/Yg5neP Click on Blue and check out the Sona Mic !!
[3:38:43] NBK_Sethus: WTF WutFace
[3:38:47] j_bar111: Does wowup also update weakauras or do you have to have the companion app
[3:38:57] Ambiidextrous_: true, thanks guys :D
[3:39:01] Ambiidextrous_: sim it up
[3:39:12] wEiRdO_dUdE: Sim it, true
[3:39:14] Molvonos: Man, I can't wait to do mage tower.  OH WAIT, IM AN EVOKER
[3:39:16] dreamwalker213: @dionaut ahh gotcha ty
[3:39:18] cabalish: i got a spark drop in the future storms, confirmed
[3:39:21] Snabido: Do it again, for FUN WutFace
[3:39:22] Lokajin: raze actually murders your single target
[3:39:23] Dionaut: So not sure if this has been posted. I'm guessing this is a bug. But for some reason you can upgrade all your ele gear. An its not charging storm sigils atm.
[3:39:26] Lokajin: dorki hated it yesterday
[3:39:30] j_bar111: isnt it called raze, like raise?
[3:39:35] jerseyfive: the point under incarn dude
[3:40:03] wEiRdO_dUdE: Raze doesn't get the benefit of the guardian aura, I heard, so it's way undertuned
[3:40:12] xghostyyx: Giga Turbo Sucking keys
[3:40:14] Cheapesttactics1: Aaron rodgers on the move?
[3:40:16] pereadin: i'm loggin in bro
[3:40:42] shayneeking: Everyone wants it for crafting it is a free +16
[3:41:02] nodramajustpizzaa: servers back up?
[3:41:07] Molvonos: Nah, you just wait for it to fall off
[3:41:13] Lokajin: @wEiRdO_dUdE honestly its biggest problem is the lack of rage your competing with ironfur uptime to raze so its really not adding much to your aoe damage but completely murders your single target.
[3:41:41] shayneeking: Yes
[3:41:50] Ambiidextrous_: how did you fix elvui? i keep getting lua errors

[3:41:52] wEiRdO_dUdE: True, raze competes with ironfur and maul for rage....that's not so fun
[3:41:59] ryknow774: How is guardian with the new changes? Sorry if I missed it
[3:42:05] Cheapesttactics1: hiw do you make the neck?
[3:42:06] Shuttlelol: crafted item
[3:42:14] Lokajin: @wEiRdO_dUdE well it replaces maul so :P
[3:42:34] Contendedlemon: apparently theres a bug with the storms fury event and when the trial of elements is up the storm event gets phased
[3:42:37] wEiRdO_dUdE: That new talent that makes ironfur do damage sounds great, but it's a little tough to get to it in the talent tree
[3:42:39] Masqerader: also a spark week yay
[3:43:13] WasomeWasTaken: why not have shadowcore oil?
[3:43:20] Lokajin: @wEiRdO_dUdE ya there might actually be a shout for making a ironfur spam build for aoe damage.
[3:43:26] Mecabeast: does academy have a good 1h for brew?
[3:43:36] S7ORM_: Why can’t orcs be paladins ?
[3:43:38] Arch0ntas777: Maners subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 6 months! yooooo
[3:43:46] wEiRdO_dUdE: Galactic is kind of silly but it does work
[3:44:00] jerseyfive: thorns suck its like 3% overall dmg
[3:44:21] Lokajin: tooth and claw applying on aoe to multiple targets is nice
[3:44:26] Mecabeast: did you repeatedly he said he pushed updates yesterday

[3:44:53] wEiRdO_dUdE: Pulverize needs to stop consuming stacks of thrash DoT
[3:45:28] schrad3rrrrrrr: What does fortified do ?
[3:45:48] wEiRdO_dUdE: So yeah, the changes to guardian are not ideal....could have been better
[3:45:58] NBK_Sethus: o boi
[3:46:07] ThePawPaw: dracJAM
[3:46:28] Lokajin: it just feels like its a tuning issue one good pass of buffs tot he talents and the spec is great
[3:46:28] wEiRdO_dUdE: Yep
[3:46:36] NBK_Sethus: I like guardian before this patch, just needed a bit of magic def

[3:47:44] sinlesssinner: trash = butt clenched @Towelliee
[3:47:52] captivate7: you get ptsd from it lol
[3:47:53] WasomeWasTaken: sanguine gives all tanks ptsd
[3:47:55] captivate7: I hate it
[3:48:07] Mesamara: I did same thing this wwwk
[3:48:10] wEiRdO_dUdE: Berserk can be a big waste and the tree forces you into it
[3:48:14] irvingxander: oh ye i hate sanguine too
[3:48:15] Feta_Cheez: elemental shamans hate sanguine as well
[3:48:33] irvingxander: need monks for sanguine
[3:48:53] Teriyakibro: luxthoKEKSh
[3:49:15] WasomeWasTaken: storming aint great either...
[3:49:19] Lokajin: @Feta_Cheez and destro locks everything etting pulled outta 10 ROF's feels bad
[3:49:23] Heero_Effect: New Jersey sleeping eye? The heck that mean haha
[3:49:26] DhioGaming: new jersey slow eye
[3:49:32] HD_MOVIE_SOURCE: So bear talents are still not good? @Towelliee
[3:49:43] wEiRdO_dUdE: The warrior tree is better when you really close at them, part of why warrior tends to be better
[3:49:46] Feta_Cheez: @Feta_Cheez yeah i can imagine Destros raging too
[3:50:09] Lokajin: Destros just uninstall the spec for that week
[3:50:20] Lokajin: unplayable on sanguine
[3:50:49] MedicineMan: Did anyone see the holy priest DPS?
[3:50:57] Awwshifty: I do that as tank as well
[3:51:01] MedicineMan: they can out DPS the tank ez now
[3:51:02] itsagentscully: tanks are supposed to eat them for melee uptime
[3:51:03] Vluggedaafie: ye helps melee alot
[3:51:04] Lokajin: do love that we can comfortably take typhoon now
[3:51:05] Valzark: dont do any
[3:51:07] ohLATE: our tank eats them on purpose also, helps al ot
[3:51:13] Lokajin: another utility interrupt/pushback
[3:51:20] Jak_and_Nyla: Anything you can do to make it easier for the DPS.  I I clear them out too.
[3:51:25] ThePawPaw: @MedicineMan Surelly KEKW

[3:51:56] MedicineMan: @MedicineMan No Kapp. Trust
[3:52:02] roac: don't wait, rotate thrash and mangle
[3:52:21] Gitmm: I think its better they need to buff incarn dmg
[3:52:28] wEiRdO_dUdE: I don't like incarn either, really....I'm not a big fan of 3 minute cooldowns
[3:52:42] roac: oh i agree, same here, feels a little awward
[3:52:46] roac: awkward
[3:52:54] Valzark: always thrashin
[3:52:55] WasomeWasTaken: "i dont like change T_T" :D
[3:52:56] Pharaoh_326: WTF my catalyst quest just dropped from 70% done to 30%
[3:53:29] BobLongMVP: @wvznt_me boss kill hotfix. Wasn’t “working as intended”
[3:53:41] Heero_Effect: @wvznt_me sounds like you are beta testing
[3:53:44] BobLongMVP: @wvznt_me I’m assuming you killed World boss
[3:53:47] Stoops21: just got a bottled essence from dirt pile ;)
[3:53:57] wEiRdO_dUdE: 3 minute and 5 minute cooldowns are boomer stuff
[3:54:00] Vluggedaafie: just kill 5 worlds bosses instead of 2
[3:54:04] Pharaoh_326: @boblongmvp i killed the boss with 6 different characters though lol
[3:54:14] wEiRdO_dUdE: Vicious cycle is a kind of passive
[3:54:47] wEiRdO_dUdE: With vicious cycle basically you just don't want to use something more than 3 times in a row ever
[3:55:17] Rudric_Ice: does HOV feel good to time now ?
[3:55:17] Moobot:  Help Towelliee reach the 1,000,000 followers goal. Click that heart button and join the Hammer Squad community!
[3:55:30] wEiRdO_dUdE: I used to be able to nail maul like 5 times in a row, but you would want to weave in mangle
[3:56:29] wEiRdO_dUdE: I think the 4 piece with mangle heal makes it more important that you do use it between some mauls
[3:56:30] rosina_scarlett: did you get his new weak aura's?
[3:56:32] mikeymoto: I’m about to start doing +10’s what’s the addon that shows thundering ?

[3:58:00] dimofodi: Number over it changes to a 2?

[3:59:16] wEiRdO_dUdE: Apparently tooth and claw hasn't been reducing magic damage, some bug

[4:00:15] Slowtwitch: anyone in chat know if non elites bolster like adds by tree boss in AA?
[4:00:22] Lokajin: I think he means the number at the top of maul
[4:00:44] NBK_Sethus: sanguine emotional damage
[4:00:48] abracka_: mans got PTSD from last week
[4:00:53] WasomeWasTaken: tanks being PTSD'd for weeks after sanguine xD

[4:01:45] NBK_Sethus: almost karma'd LUL
[4:01:53] WasomeWasTaken: so yea
[4:01:55] rosina_scarlett: Monk is according to Naowh the best Tank for M+ xD
[4:02:00] tr4ncetv: pop-pop-pop that puzzle
[4:02:10] rosina_scarlett: @WasomeWasTaken NotLikeThis
[4:02:23] wEiRdO_dUdE: Item level definitely helps, frenzied regen is a % of health
[4:02:23] NBK_Sethus: yea monk tank is crazy op now, idk what were Blizzard thinking
[4:02:31] Lokajin: @rosina_scarlett other then warrior cause warrior does pretty much the same shit but is miles easier to play you need a DDR pad to play monk properly right now lol
[4:02:31] Raxxiety: @rosina_scarlett just read that as well
[4:03:02] rosina_scarlett: @rosina_scarlett Nah he says it's way better then war now
[4:03:09] homewrecker101: lux posted he going live now @Towelliee
[4:03:17] wEiRdO_dUdE: Yeah warrior is still at the top of the list
[4:03:19] Lokajin: Noawh is also biased against warior
[4:03:23] Lokajin: cause he fundamentally hates the class
[4:03:33] Lokajin: he literally refuses to play it even when it was bis
[4:03:35] WasomeWasTaken: stepped into the purple gasscloud
[4:03:36] largefromage: gogirlWoww
[4:03:39] MFAM_THE_Steven: its such a short cooldown use it when its up just to help keep yourself and others topped off
[4:03:41] WasomeWasTaken: feels bad man
[4:03:47] WasomeWasTaken: LUL
[4:03:51] NBK_Sethus: Jebaited
[4:03:56] largefromage: pepeMeltdown
[4:03:56] WasomeWasTaken: blizzard knows
[4:03:57] Xara36: owned
[4:04:00] rosina_scarlett: LUL
[4:04:06] Merkuriuz: nah, its just you KEKW

[4:04:20] Merkuriuz: Streamer luck btw
[4:04:23] tmiguel27: Thats jackpot KEKW
[4:04:23] WasomeWasTaken: i didnt get a single piece of loot last week. ran like 10 m+'s
[4:04:27] wEiRdO_dUdE: They need to code smart loot that can check your item levels and give you something you need, imo
[4:04:31] Opijum: na its jut streamer loot  LUL
[4:04:33] Lokajin: 19 temple also known as a 19 deplete :D
[4:04:35] gurnt4: lux just went live
[4:04:43] CEK_kingdom: temple EZ
[4:04:50] Rudric_Ice: no HOV :(
[4:04:57] Autoexeq: How's bear feeling?
[4:05:02] Heero_Effect: To combat the tank shortage. Tanks get less gear on runs to make sure DPS have more tanks around.
[4:05:03] NBK_Sethus: temple trash is just brutal, something off the charts with scaling there
[4:05:05] WasomeWasTaken: Temple NotLikeThis
[4:05:20] tmiguel27: This past weeks for me loot only on vault opening LUL all i get is primal chaos
[4:05:26] WasomeWasTaken: @Autoexeq appearantly "not quite right"
[4:05:27] ashawn40: how do you gain progress on the catalyst bar?
[4:05:48] Snabido: 'complete group content' 🤔
[4:05:53] MFAM_THE_Steven: World boss gives you 50%
[4:05:58] MFAM_THE_Steven: then do group WQs
[4:05:58] Snabido: Does that involve grouping up
[4:06:01] dimofodi: Killing the World Boss on 2 accounts fills the bar.
[4:06:01] Lazermage23: You get 25% per boss in LFR
[4:06:02] wEiRdO_dUdE: A lot of sources for the catalyst quest
[4:06:06] JustSalvation: doesn't seem to work in LFG/LFR

[4:07:14] LoseAlotLuke: fail = kick
[4:07:15] LoseAlotLuke: LUL

[4:08:30] WasomeWasTaken: Fun detected, apply the hot fix
[4:08:37] wEiRdO_dUdE: If you can pick up the catalyst quest on each alt and just do the world boss with each, that's pretty sweet
[4:08:38] Moobot: you can figure out how long you've been following any channel by simply clicking on your own name in chat :)
[4:08:53] wEiRdO_dUdE: I was going to say, that sounds too easy
[4:08:56] JimKappa420: world boss still 20%
[4:08:59] Mesamara: storming random off minions not players
[4:09:01] MrsPyra: 20% for doing dragonbane keep
[4:09:03] SilkeySmooth: glad i did it yesterday or i mite have unsubbed
[4:09:04] sinlesssinner: well the quest for the catalyst is bugged on EU, i cant find it on my chars lol

[4:09:28] CEK_kingdom: i think temple tyran week is harder than fort. the last boss in temple is probably the hardest current M+ boss in higher keys
[4:09:32] Ryvden: the horn or siege didnt count for mine
[4:09:37] DUCK__FOOT: hotfix fer days
[4:09:38] SilkeySmooth: imagine forcing player to group for something everyoen gets
[4:09:47] Doohzyy: spriest got like a 26% buff or something at 8+ targets
[4:09:48] Lokajin: ya shadows AOE is actually filthy now
[4:09:55] WasomeWasTaken: we'll see if they have the slaps on this one example
[4:09:55] fistofnature: world boss only gives 20% now PepeHands
[4:09:56] MrsPyra: @Ryvden i just finished it and it did for me
[4:09:57] Lokajin: like unethical levels of damage
[4:10:12] wEiRdO_dUdE: LFR will save us LUL
[4:10:18] CongoJackNA: it can be done on 2 characters
[4:10:20] JustSalvation: anyone actually getting progress in LFR? I'm not
[4:10:26] CongoJackNA: 2 characters doing the world boss is 100%
[4:10:26] bruttmurk: then why is it there in first place
[4:10:28] SilkeySmooth: you can stil ldo it with bgs?
[4:10:28] CEK_kingdom: play the game and you fill the bar
[4:10:28] CongoJackNA: it takes 10 mins
[4:10:29] WasomeWasTaken: LFR gonna be busy LUL

[4:23:51] Dox023: Zeroth Mortis?
[4:24:17] Kelld: !talents
[4:24:29] AlphasaurusRexx: i must say the storming affix does not make sense. why would the end boss give you a buff to hold as long as possible?
[4:24:39] Prevention6: I got a piece of tier gear from my vault and I only did mythic dungeons last week no raid bosses
[4:25:16] sinlesssinner: @Prevention6 its one of those old movie bad guys, that tells ya his whole plan to kill ya, but then fails at the end :)
[4:26:17] j_hooligan: i think the storm cache works like the hunts each time the rewards decrease

[4:26:59] AlphasaurusRexx: @psycho_ty1998 push higher keys. find a friend group to learn and grow with or keep pugging higher keys.
[4:29:12] izzlarn65: what ilvl is your bear?
[4:29:26] wEiRdO_dUdE: Prot pally has so many interrupts, that helps
[4:29:47] ArcaneMaki: Bring MARK OF URSOL back!
[4:29:54] GingerGambit: Could just be ilvl but bear damage seems low compared to other tanks
[4:30:43] datsamuraiguy: wait it doesn't mitigate magic dmg? the tool tip just says 15%
[4:30:44] ArcaneMaki: Mark of Ursol (back in the days): 45 Rage 0.5 sec cooldown Instant Reduces magical damage taken by 30% for 6 sec.

[4:32:34] Dox023: I mean it’s probably good on brewmaster. They do a billion dps.
[4:32:56] jqmartin13: ive noticed even in raid that taunting doesnt even take aggro sometimes.. gotta taunt two or three times
[4:33:03] rampage1526: I was losing agree a lot today on raid to a Prot pally. I'm a DK btw
[4:33:11] rampage1526: agro*
[4:33:16] fistofnature: do bears have aoe taunt?

[4:37:39] Rhombot: towBlack
[4:37:50] Dox023: It’s amazing at proccing the seal of diurna and the seal of filial duty
[4:37:51] Lokajin: @shayneeking its always useful for tanks it just has amazing synergy for tanks that dont already have a strong means to proc the ring.
[4:37:56] shayneeking: need rings from raid for flaring to be good
[4:37:57] Lokajin: but the ring is in no way a requirement to use it
[4:38:07] Ryvden: do neck and weapon
[4:38:24] Ryvden: you can do staff
[4:39:10] tronbadgames: @Towelliee you want me to make you a lariat?
[4:39:30] Oorling: the ring isn't a requirement to use it lol
[4:39:32] rosina_scarlett: hes exporting the WA @Towelliee

[4:42:59] Felric_DH: youre really only ever using r2 mats with most crafters that are somewhat leveled. only time you use r3 mats is when using a insight or the means in which a guranteed r3/r5 is crafted
[4:43:10] tronbadgames: nothing man
[4:43:15] tronbadgames: it's just a click for me

[4:46:03] mcatx2: is it 1 charge per toon
[4:46:03] Dox023: Each character has their own charges
[4:46:05] inj0shwetrust: I think its 2 sparks for 2h weap craft
[4:46:08] mcatx2: or just 1 toon
[4:46:08] WundertueteGER: one charge Pog
[4:46:14] rosina_scarlett: @mcatx2 yes

[4:46:53] daGawdT: what is considered group content for catalyst quest
[4:46:54] mcatx2: Wasn't sure if after you used 1 charge on 1 toon it applies to the other toon w/o choosing an item
[4:46:56] Dox023: They bank to a cap of 6 per character
[4:47:12] Autoexeq: People out here asking as if they started playing today

[4:50:37] tronbadgames: if it doesn't cost me mettle.. i dont set a price, but i dont advertise often
[4:50:51] wEiRdO_dUdE: Let's see how cheap the weapon enchants are
[4:50:59] MFAM_THE_Steven: Stat Vers

[6:04:09] shayneeking: Any aoe has to be ontop of huim
[6:04:12] stonyman187: maybe something with the UI.  You did have that issue with your bags before
[6:04:16] lorddrekken: the attack distance on raze doesnt seem right either
[6:04:18] HD_MOVIE_SOURCE: Ranged Bug @Towelliee
[6:04:19] mavericks312: there response....seems to be a skill issue lol
[6:04:39] Kelld: RAZE IZ NOT WORKING ON BOSSES @Towelliee
[6:04:41] shayneeking: It is that boss try to thrash him, you will see his hitbox is 100% smaller than it looks
[6:04:43] RoboMaximillion: lol ok so that firestorm box from devastation is just a visual bug everyone can see.
[6:04:43] Kelld: SAME WITH ME

[6:05:23] wEiRdO_dUdE: guy called it with red square
[6:05:24] jjwoodard10: have to stand on the edge of the platform to hit
[6:05:24] shayneeking: It is that boss, it is a known issue
[6:05:27] Macrodotz: itsnot
[6:05:29] ashwing_: LUL
[6:05:31] Kamst3rTTV: That red square is the Evoker

[6:05:49] omahadadgames: is resto shaman better with this update?
[6:05:49] ArcaneMaki: I don't think the red square is the hit box, seems like a spell from Evoker
[6:05:55] Lobby_WoW: this patch
[6:05:58] CongoJackNA: its a texture from the red circle
[6:06:00] Seawolfrss: no it when certian mobs put somthing like a death and decay on the ground
[6:06:01] faulen: red box

[6:07:14] Lokajin: storming is the least of the annoying affixes
[6:07:15] Jeuffrey: square again LUL
[6:07:25] Lokajin: its honestly a push affix
[6:07:28] MedicineMan: You should see the bug i had to deal with
[6:07:50] CEK_kingdom: @Lokajin huge push week
[6:07:50] Lokajin: like for fucks sake we still have greivous
[6:07:56] Lokajin: retire that shit before storming lol
[6:08:03] ashwing_: RLP with 5 deaths is almost a dead key LUL
[6:08:04] xolossus00: imagine 23 deaths on azure vault XD
[6:08:06] ArcaneMaki: How can blizz cannot see that, it's so weird. Some timers are so fu**ed

[6:09:54] BlackMarmalade: guardian nerfs?
[6:09:57] BlackMarmalade: they just got a buff
[6:09:59] metavahn231: funny bug
[6:10:02] MedicineMan: @Itshiko hard is an understatement
[6:10:08] Big_Kan: WHAT IS THAT SQUARE ON THE GROUND?
[6:10:09] iamdig: any guardian druid out here also hating life
[6:10:14] Tripl3dot: wow imagine timing a key with 23 deaths haha
[6:10:22] Lokajin: they atleast fixed HOV with the nerfs
[6:10:27] Lokajin: so its a much more forgiving timer
[6:10:28] ArcaneMaki: towUp towUp towUp towUp
[6:10:28] Molvonos: Firestorm's garbage, lol.  Tried a new spec for big aoe and it was like, subpar
[6:10:29] PvtHudson093: nope didnt see it
[6:10:30] ashwing_: Pog
[6:10:33] Ryvden: woot
[6:10:35] Lokajin: RLP needs the same treatment still
[6:10:42] EvenstarTV: ofc i get ad when boss dies and missing what dropped NotLikeThis
[6:10:42] ripperofbong420: upgrage from a dungeon. no way
[6:10:44] mooncaster2034: SeemsGood
[6:10:50] captain_khyzan: @BlackMarmalade no guardian got a slight nerf in m+, no buffs
[6:10:58] Macrodotz: good time to take a week break from wow
[6:11:00] asimoviii: catalyst doesnt work on items from chests?
[6:11:06] BlackMarmalade: no
[6:11:09] iamdig: what talents are u using bro. im tryin to fix this ass of a tree
[6:11:29] ClassicMalcontent: Guardian talent reworking doesn't seem like a buff to me. The "added bit this" here but removed talents or reworked overall NERF to Guardian. Unless its just a straight bug
[6:11:50] BlackMarmalade: its a buff
[6:12:05] BlackMarmalade: theres no way
[6:12:10] xolossus00: imagine 23 deaths on azure vault wtf
[6:12:14] Lokajin: i feel like your gaining more playing an ironfur focused AOE build at this point.
[6:12:17] captain_khyzan: @BlackMarmalade lol see :)
[6:12:29] BlackMarmalade: their problem was survivability
[6:12:38] iamdig: incarn feels like crap
[6:12:47] Macrodotz: yh obv nerf
[6:12:52] Heero_Effect: Paid beta testers that’s what we are
[6:12:53] jjwoodard10: @BlackMarmalade still is
[6:12:55] ClassicMalcontent: @BlackMarmalade then its bugged. You just watched him getting harder slapped in M+ on stream. So if that's a 'buff' then no more 'buffs' like that. Kappa
[6:13:09] cjtopher: cjtopher subscribed with Prime. 
[6:13:49] Macrodotz: i miss double tap so bad my hunter feels weird now
[6:14:26] Lokajin: @Macrodotz ya dont get me wrong its a net dps increase with the new changes but we lost on demand burst :(
[6:14:26] captain_khyzan: @BlackMarmalade the idea was to be a buff, overall we gained no survivability and loss a small percent of dps... tuning will hopefully fix this but gotta call it at face value now... its a net loss overall as it stands
[6:14:44] BlackMarmalade: we gained survivability
[6:14:47] Jeuffrey: if it affects only few % of players, its better "to let them play" than not let them at all until its fixed for them ;)
[6:14:56] BlackMarmalade: from the arcane 20% dam reduction
[6:14:58] Snabido: Thought it was build diversity
[6:15:18] wEiRdO_dUdE: I read somewhere that people wanted the Raze kind of ability for a long time
[6:15:18] xyogger: diddent work lol

[6:15:36] Macrodotz: @Lokajin to many abilitys now iv no more room for keybinds :)
[6:15:38] ClassicMalcontent: Sounds correct. It's overall a nerf IMHO.
[6:15:39] jjwoodard10: @Towelliee the biggest issue i see with guardian is they have to many talents and to many talents in the bottom 1/3 of the talent tree
[6:15:45] lorddrekken: what was thorns of irons damage?
[6:15:48] BlackMarmalade: its the purple shield thing
[6:15:51] BlackMarmalade: idk the name
[6:15:53] BlackMarmalade: bottom right
[6:16:02] BlackMarmalade: sorry 10
[6:16:09] Lokajin: @Macrodotz how we didn't gain any new abilities lol we lost doubletap and it was turned into a passive
[6:16:19] BlackMarmalade: couldn't take it in the bast
[6:16:21] BlackMarmalade: past*
[6:16:38] BlackMarmalade: you gave up so much if you took it in the past
[6:16:39] Jeuffrey: twin moonfire was +20% or so but it was like 2 months ago
[6:16:41] captain_khyzan: moonfire bear been using that
[6:16:47] Itshiko: can you give us your best bear impression
[6:17:26] Itshiko: LUL
[6:17:29] wEiRdO_dUdE: Lunar beam is kind of counterintuitive if it summons a beam at one spot, when we are usually running around crazy thrashing
[6:17:30] Macrodotz: let us hear u roar :)
[6:17:40] iamdig: were not
[6:17:44] iamdig: we suck
[6:17:45] BlackMarmalade: fair
[6:17:47] senarth: they did
[6:17:50] senarth: they are now unplayable
[6:17:56] shayneeking: They are played the same and feels the same as prior to patch.
[6:18:24] Sayryn: They can't be that good if Pumps didn't take either one in any of his builds
[6:18:38] Foretoldlegends: I feel guardian druids need the 100% CD on Mangle when we use incarnation.
[6:18:53] Foretoldlegends: It helps a lot for Ironfur upkeep.
[6:19:15] wEiRdO_dUdE: It's not just Pumps, others are doing the same thing

[6:38:11] bapele45: aoe
[6:38:18] chriswrites: i tried to play DH and i felt like i needed to do a line of coke to play it
[6:38:20] Incredible_Sausage: oh dang, orc heritage armor lookin SICK
[6:38:22] j_bar111: @Towelliee did you see the orc human heritage armor preview?
[6:38:46] Heero_Effect: towBluewing towBlue

[6:40:26] AlphasaurusRexx: man they need to add a spectate feature to mage tower
[6:40:33] omahadadgames: sorry i asked this ealier but missed the response....how is resto shaman looking after this patch?
[6:40:33] AlphasaurusRexx: i love watching people try it
[6:40:43] Heero_Effect: @thoreya we?
[6:41:00] Thoreya: i meant the stream
[6:41:02] AlphasaurusRexx: @OmahaGamingDad youll do more damage but your healing will be about the same
[6:41:08] Dox023: @towelliee that last pack exists to take a shit in every tanks cheerios.
[6:41:44] thebakeriscomingforu: Vdh Always felt like the dungeon tank
[6:41:50] GingerGambit: VDH is my first true tank that I have played. Raid feels fine for the most part till heroic. Start taking alot of damage in raid and that's with a more tanky build
[6:42:04] shapebender: dk tanks always seems meta lol
[6:42:15] omahadadgames: @OmahaGamingDad is their healing on par with the others?
[6:42:33] GingerGambit: their aor and dots are really nice in big pacts
[6:42:46] GingerGambit: aoe*
[6:42:51] Synaerio: @matter19 well when you can essentially heal yourself for 99% of your total HP under the right circumstances yea
[6:42:56] shapebender: dk tanks in a skilled tank seems almost unkillable
[6:43:00] PvtHudson093: first look at Orc/Human heritage armour https://www.wowhead.com/news/first-look-at-human-and-orc-heritage-armor-coming-in-patch-10-0-7-331155
[6:43:02] AlphasaurusRexx: @OmahaGamingDad the healing is still less than others, and requires 7+ gcds to set up
[6:43:11] Redpandalol: 3rd bis
[6:43:14] smashwow: it's ok
[6:43:17] AdvizerTV: good for DH
[6:43:19] Oorling: yes it's good

[6:43:56] dutchie76: SeemsGood
[6:44:00] james_bah: "Just for additional context on the Heritage Armor sets for orc and human, there are a couple more variations players will get. We’ll show more of those a bit later."
[6:44:16] dutchie76: anyone do the primalist boss yet?
[6:44:18] CEK_kingdom: if ritual shell went to like 415 id be one of the best trinkets in the game i think
[6:44:30] pereadin: nah you did fine on that one bro, i 100% accidentally pulled one of the packs in the extended pull
[6:44:43] AlphasaurusRexx: @OmahaGamingDad i mean its completely viable healer. its not like youll be hardstuck 15s. you just have to get used to pre-setting up your heals where before it was a lot of reactive healing
[6:44:44] kappaday23: Kappa //
[6:44:49] Oorling: try a 19 ruby, i got rekt in it earlier
[6:44:54] dutchie76: arcano crystal

[6:46:42] abracka_: alliance one just looks too similar to the warfront gear from BFA
[6:46:45] largefromage: SMOrc
[6:46:47] omahadadgames: @OmahaGamingDad apologies....i was looking at PVP specifically
[6:46:49] Molvonos: Alliance need to understand their place at the bottom of the trashcan

[6:47:34] AlphasaurusRexx: @OmahaGamingDad oh. they nerfed stormkeeper and riptide healing, but the meta also shifted. i think resto shaman is still A tier in pvp
