[0:12:35] guynormally: baomotePrayge bless you, oh great waffle cat
[0:12:42] AvalenaTV: i swapped from disc to monk mid tindral prog. how can 2 classes feel so hugely different, playing melee there is like a walk in the park
[0:12:43] velidien: you got any inside information about the mdi?
[0:12:47] AvalenaTV: 10/10 can recommend
[0:12:51] x_ANiMa: will we get wafflecat commentary during mdi?
[0:12:53] zachl_: YUHHHHHH
[0:12:57] count_chocula4: Hey growl, any thoughts on the new blizzard president
[0:13:09] zachl_: @count_chocula4 my thoughts? were so fucked
[0:13:17] JakobLowrizzle: isnt yip in mdi ? did he escape practice
[0:13:17] yctnm: duo church man HOLY
[0:13:27] velidien: you know what the new god comp is? Prot War, 3 Spriest, 1 MW.
[0:13:45] AvalenaTV: yeah i played SF there at the start, the CDR to hit your marks is sooo tight
[0:13:53] paulwow777: PepeLaugh
[0:13:55] zachl_: dude growl ur not a cod guy but
[0:13:55] velidien: wowhead has an article i believe
[0:13:57] zachl_: we are
[0:13:58] zachl_: so fucked
[0:14:11] count_chocula4: It's the call of duty general manager
[0:14:12] velidien: whys that zach, im not a cod guy either
[0:14:17] x_ANiMa: never seen the new president before. why are we fucked? :d
[0:14:39] zachl_: if anyone played under the cods where she was in charge, u know those cods were the absolute WORST
[0:14:40] AvalenaTV: who is the new president even? is there any consequence for us?
[0:14:42] yctnm: wow on the same trajectory as cod Aware
[0:14:44] zachl_: my honest take is that
[0:14:47] zachl_: this is gonna be so bad
[0:14:59] count_chocula4: Xaryu asked the question "does she play wow? She knows business but does she know the games"
[0:15:05] treavorthenusance: eh maybe but alot of that cod stuff could have been pushed by bobby aswell
[0:15:17] reedsworld: but what if she makes wow esports better? @zachl_
[0:15:22] velidien: yabra left eh
[0:15:25] velidien: Sadge
[0:15:31] zachl_: bro sorry but no one cares about wow esports @reedsworld
[0:15:37] zachl_: as much as i like it
[0:15:38] zachl_: or we do
[0:15:46] reedsworld: @zachl_ true true wishful thinking lmao
[0:15:48] zachl_: the relative population doesnt gaf about esports in wow
[0:16:09] velidien: @zachl_ wow esports biggest viewership is on something blizzard doesnt even touch. RWF. The numbers max pulls alone during that is crazy
[0:16:17] velidien: And its free for blizzard they wont ever touch it
[0:16:21] itsthingb: at blizzcon
[0:16:23] zachl_: even then mdi is dogshit too so
[0:16:27] simplepathwow: SNIFFA
[0:16:31] amrghr: DRAMA?
[0:16:37] count_chocula4: Probably and replacing him with COD, another madden cash geab
[0:16:43] velidien: SNIFA
[0:16:47] count_chocula4: Monka
[0:16:49] itsthingb: heard it was said at blizzcon could find it there
[0:16:52] zachl_: idk maybe im dooming but i dont see anything good comin from this
[0:17:05] xGuiha: you are dooming a lot
[0:17:18] treavorthenusance: i mean everyone doomed about activision back in 08 and while some things got worse some things got better
[0:17:20] velidien: I would hope there is checks/balances in place to stop 1 person from making big decisions.
[0:17:22] cucumbertoessniffa: i saw someone ask if qwik went non verbal HUH
[0:17:25] velidien: you need to have a team do that
[0:17:29] simplepathwow: you should need a certain io for the position
[0:17:32] zachl_: this is PERSONAL VIEW: i feel like all the cods she was overseeing were dogshit
[0:17:32] reedsworld: yea but you're allocating resources based on expectations
[0:17:44] zachl_: PERSONAL OPINION !
[0:17:53] AvalenaTV: Dear Blizzard boss, please give disc priest a kick. With kind regards, twitch chat
[0:17:55] velidien: too late zach i clipped it and shipped it
[0:18:00] velidien: youre speaking for the masses
[0:18:03] count_chocula4: I wonder how metzens vision and the new president will work though
[0:18:18] Uglification: recent CoDs have been "okay". they scrape by and delay content like Ranked Play for 3 months to bring people back
[0:18:32] count_chocula4: Who gets to enable their vision based on how they see success
[0:18:41] zachl_: @Uglification which is directly why i dont like it because old cods had people reeled in until the next cods
[0:18:51] Uglification: kinda reminds me of the last few wow xpacs before Dragonflight. just kinda the same thing in a different setting
[0:18:53] zachl_: maybe thats the gaming meta now but personal take every cod she oversaw was dogshit
[0:19:02] velidien: Has the COD formula just run dry though? Like what can you change to COD to make it better? I think of CS:GO it was so good and didnt change for a long time
[0:19:11] Razdruid: the final fantasy series
[0:19:13] Razdruid: is amazing
[0:19:18] Razdruid: minus like one game
[0:19:18] count_chocula4: South park is really good still
[0:19:28] Uglification: my opinion is stop making new cods every year and go to a CoD mobile system, but that wont happen
[0:19:40] count_chocula4: Rick and morty dropped off, but this last season was pretty good
[0:19:40] AvalenaTV: Same for raid shadow legends, absolute banger Kappa
[0:19:41] velidien: Again, im someone who doesnt play COD so I dont know it, just an outside opinion looking in
[0:19:52] Razdruid: also howdy mr cat
[0:20:00] zachl_: i used to be a major cod fan before i got good at m+
[0:20:04] treavorthenusance: executives look at dollars. if wow brings in dollars they dont give a shit tbh
[0:20:07] Uglification: my point is it could use a nice revamp like WoW got with dragonflight. evergreen systems ect that dont go away from game to game
[0:20:09] itsthingb: donowalled sadge
[0:20:10] MicHawkh: Rage
[0:20:12] Razdruid: how did you like your youtube streaming experience?
[0:20:13] treavorthenusance: if it dosn't they'll intervene
[0:20:25] simplepathwow: do you have a speech for when u kill?
[0:20:31] TheDauntlessBunny: will the guild kill fyrakk, or will fyrakk kill the guild?
[0:20:37] IAttackYou: Kappa
[0:20:42] itsthingb: oh okay papigrowl <3
[0:20:46] RamblingJosh_: catarrivinginatrashcan time 2 attack
[0:20:53] treavorthenusance: youtubes bitrate is so much better
[0:21:08] Razdruid: I remember
[0:21:08] AvalenaTV: can you stream on both simultaniously?
[0:21:09] SurfSalsa: YEP
[0:21:12] quov123: yeah
[0:21:14] simplepathwow: uhhhh
[0:21:16] x_ANiMa: glorious times
[0:21:18] SurfSalsa: Deadge
[0:21:19] velidien: the best thing with youtube is real time being able to scroll back on the live video. So if you missed something you could go back quickly check it go back to live
[0:21:30] velidien: twitch needs to implement that somehow its so giga
[0:21:32] Razdruid: yeah you refused to watch vods for awhile there
[0:21:36] Razdruid: on stream at least
[0:21:39] IAttackYou: that was so good
[0:21:42] Deepduckz: !ui
[0:21:42] Nightbot: Addon list here: https://justpaste.it/5pvuo NEW UI vid: https://youtu.be/_cn344NOZd8 .New Exports here: https://linktr.ee/yumytv
[0:22:00] simplepathwow: throttled?
[0:22:01] amrghr: it's an adblocker on chrome
[0:22:02] treavorthenusance: its weird that aws is the industry standard but its streaming service is much worse than youtubes
[0:22:04] Avatz: adblock
[0:22:06] Uglification: my cope is she will see how WoW has turned around its reception by listening to players, and tell CoD to do that. I doubt they mess up what they created with DF
[0:22:08] damnation93: do you have adblock? my youtube started to lag recently
[0:22:09] damnation93: because of it
[0:22:10] stonksftwttv: turn off adblocker to stop utube lag
[0:22:11] guynormally: that's just youtube. if you have an adblocker they slow you down now
[0:22:13] Hymmer: that’s Adblock thing with yt
[0:22:14] RamblingJosh_: adblock?
[0:22:16] MierkaBlue: ALOO, cute-friends!
[0:22:18] Ifwuzzy: happens to me too
[0:22:28] Razdruid: na
[0:22:30] guynormally: yes
[0:22:31] Ifwuzzy: i have premium
[0:22:31] Razdruid: yes
[0:22:33] Hymmer: yea
[0:22:36] Ifwuzzy: and it happens to me
[0:22:40] IAttackYou: yes it does on me
[0:22:42] x_ANiMa: maybe whitelist youtube just to be safe
[0:22:44] amrghr: if adblocker is installed it fs your youtube
[0:22:46] simplepathwow: ad block crashes my chrome with yt sometimes
[0:22:47] guynormally: If youtube detects an adblocker on your pc it will slow you down regardless
[0:22:48] Avatz: yes , just desable on youtube
[0:22:52] Hymmer: ye
[0:22:56] Uglification: there was rumors of a 5 sec delay with anyone using an adblocker lol
[0:22:58] amrghr: there's an alternative
[0:22:58] Codester_remix: Yeah youtube made a thing that videos become shit if you have adblock. And it is bugged with premium but it might be fixed not
[0:23:01] Razdruid: I have twitch turbo and if I had ad block running it will give me an ad if I have it on
[0:23:03] Hymmer: works for me
[0:23:03] amrghr: ublock
[0:23:04] IAttackYou: just switch away from chrome
[0:23:24] x_ANiMa: oh now we arent just chatters anymore eh
[0:23:33] Avatz: LUL
[0:23:44] velidien: my adblocker doesnt work for twitch
[0:23:48] velidien: ublock is cucked for someteason
[0:23:49] cosmichole2002: YouTube anti ablock notice stops me from watching YouTube if adblock is off, if adblock is on the turn off adblock doesn't show
[0:23:57] Razdruid: I remember the days of you being a SEO
[0:24:00] Razdruid: KEKW
[0:24:02] epilepticunicorn_: on a scale of 1-10 are you going to kill boss tonight?
[0:24:03] treavorthenusance: the unit defaults to entropy
[0:24:07] AvalenaTV: we're no parasites anymore, we evolved and live in perfect harmony Pog
[0:24:08] treavorthenusance: universe*
[0:24:10] x_ANiMa: streamer washed - asking chatters for help. what has the world come to
[0:24:13] Chompsy: Please sir, do not waste the 9th live on Fryakk NOOOO
[0:24:19] streyeker: the yummytv rdruid guides taught me how to heal in bfa
[0:24:24] simplepathwow: CopiumTime
[0:24:29] Hymmer: yumytvPray
[0:24:43] Razdruid: honestly if you guys don't scuff the orbs and seeds you have it down but I know that is like the biggest prog points
[0:24:51] x_ANiMa: i rolled healer because of this stream KEKW what a shit decision
[0:25:01] mikeywatt: mikeywatt subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 20 months, currently on a 7 month streak! gonna send fyrakk to ImOverHereTakingANapRNIGotPillowsUnderMyHeadRNImSleepyAsFuckManImASnoozeMan
[0:25:06] ghantous: lmao

[0:25:07] d3rftree: KEKG
[0:25:27] Emm_Zee: !civcheck
[0:25:27] Nightbot: Emm_Zee is 94% civilian.
[0:25:30] velidien: drohgoh wont gquit, but you lose the MW on Tuesday
[0:25:32] Emm_Zee: Aware
[0:25:34] kabong200: hahjahahahaha ALWAYS EVERBLOOM
[0:25:36] zachl_: it has a weird name
[0:25:42] RamblingJosh_: does the chance of disband go up or down if the boss dies
[0:25:46] zachl_: it got messed up in christmas emote bonanza
[0:25:50] velidien: Last night Drohgoh said his most consistent/trust worthy raider is Growl.
[0:25:56] AvalenaTV: another everdoom here we go KEKW
[0:26:08] velidien: 100% Ill find the clip
[0:26:16] simplepathwow: but ur attitude is good
[0:26:18] Emm_Zee: He says that to not ego boost tmsean too much Kappa
[0:26:21] simplepathwow: and u always show up
[0:26:34] d3rftree: your mistake is amplified because chat shits on you every time KEKG
[0:26:41] q_u_v_p: he was going off on "selfish" players
[0:26:53] simplepathwow: nobody knows what happens
[0:26:56] Razdruid: all the time
[0:26:58] SurfSalsa: yeah it saves so much time when people own up
[0:27:00] d3rftree: CAUGHT
[0:27:03] TheSemiDutch: @velidien maybe he said he's the most consistent at making mistakes and trustworthy that he will admit he fucked up
[0:27:04] kabong200: THat's facts
[0:27:07] Taaz: Yumy must be a flower bc hes always in Bloom
[0:27:07] Ventorpoe: Those are the shitters
[0:27:15] simplepathwow: healers almost nver burn adds
[0:27:16] Ventorpoe: and im not there to call em out
[0:27:21] bigchurchman: And then theres still silence KEKW
[0:27:21] RamblingJosh_: it helps when you're being compared against "alt-f4ed"
[0:27:22] simplepathwow: its always the melee RAGEY
[0:27:29] velidien: KEKW
[0:27:30] AvalenaTV: ye thats smart, saves everyones time cause the truth will come out anyways :D
[0:27:38] streyeker: " I was tabbed out playing geo"
[0:27:40] simplepathwow: Deadge
[0:27:52] njokkio: best thing is when people deny despite logs clearly showing who it was
[0:28:02] Emm_Zee: "wait what?" Is the best response xdd
[0:28:39] velidien: Drohgoh was just talking about how he will be restructuring the guild after MDI. Learned a lot and he will prioritize dedication. The guild has had a LOT of raiders come and go and he doesnt have dedicated players. I made a joke saying Growl going to be kept? and he said no bs youre the one staying FOR SURE lol
[0:29:05] d3rftree: KEKG
[0:29:14] velidien: life of a shaman
[0:29:21] Emm_Zee: Yeah but enha is just perma floor pov Despairge
[0:29:30] jenkinsdonuttv: They think of the game not normally
[0:29:33] RamblingJosh_: that's some sick intel, bless
[0:29:49] d3rftree: wow will always have people come and go unless you are a super degen, cant really mythic raid if you have a job and family
[0:29:57] velidien: after last nights raid he had a bit of a vent session
[0:29:58] Razdruid: is he restructuring the gromnak out of the guild?
[0:30:01] velidien: it was actually good to hear
[0:30:03] jenkinsdonuttv: BORGAR
[0:30:04] TheDauntlessBunny: POG
[0:30:10] TheDauntlessBunny: Burgerge
[0:30:11] Rampo123: why u living with a roomate
[0:30:12] Taaz: OWL2019ez
[0:30:14] d3rftree: gromnak is the best raider in na
[0:30:21] AvalenaTV: uhm you do know you're missing a mage? 30s with non meta combs are forbidden
[0:30:26] velidien: you got wholefoods money?
[0:30:36] ssj_lenin: id have to take out a loan to shop at whole foods
[0:30:46] velidien: true i guess

[0:30:57] epilepticunicorn_: hey growl want to be my new roommate? i need that food money
[0:31:03] velidien: nah
[0:31:10] simplepathwow: hmmmm
[0:31:16] x_ANiMa: it better be a honda
[0:31:18] SCMSV: Growl got the Volkswagen
[0:31:21] jenkinsdonuttv: You travel through the World of Warcraft tho
[0:31:22] noldan216: corolla
[0:31:28] TheSemiDutch: Growl, jokes asides, I've been watching you for years. Do you live from streaming and content creation only or you have some jobs or whatever?
[0:31:29] velidien: just curious if you splurged on like an audi or some shit
[0:31:29] amperegames: old lady cars goated
[0:31:29] RamblingJosh_: the turnip meta is unfortunate
[0:31:31] AvalenaTV: the only car i have is the one of the pizza deliveryguy and its a glorious relationship
[0:31:32] TheDauntlessBunny: thats crazy
[0:31:58] SCMSV: Oldsmobile hypnoLUL
[0:32:02] jenkinsdonuttv: Don't tell chat the kind of car you own, someone will find you on Geogueser xdd
[0:32:15] epilepticunicorn_: SNIFFA
[0:32:16] RamblingJosh_: Growl lives in the geo car
[0:32:19] SCMSV: Growl's car is on Geoguesser bet
[0:32:58] Arisolo: with 2 days before time trials i'm surprised the teams aren't playing together on live
[0:33:13] velidien: google maps for outside of my house is 10+ years old
[0:33:15] Cobolt_: is ret meta now with their 20th buff??
[0:33:21] ssj_lenin: lmfao
[0:33:33] kabong200: lol
[0:33:50] epilepticunicorn_: thats the peak thumbnail game
[0:34:17] Emm_Zee: Dodge or Deadge
[0:34:19] RamblingJosh_: It communicates a lot tbh, you know he spends that whole video dragonriding in valdrakan
[0:34:29] SurfSalsa: I wish the joke thumbnail for your story about the druid discord was actually used
[0:34:30] x_ANiMa: those beyblade bois are annoying af
[0:35:12] AvalenaTV: KEKW
[0:35:15] kabong200: KEKW
[0:35:34] simplepathwow: KEKW
[0:35:36] AvalenaTV: dead either way
[0:35:45] Mikeygee5: i like the 3 dps meters, just so you can reinforce whos on top
[0:35:47] simplepathwow: atal vibes
[0:35:51] epilepticunicorn_: deaths lower than key still its fine xdd
[0:35:58] Razdruid: its almost like you called it
[0:36:28] AvalenaTV: just MC one 5Head
[0:36:39] x_ANiMa: think there should be a slight delay so got at least a chance to walk out without getting clapped
[0:36:53] TheDauntlessBunny: can you not time the 30 after that?
[0:36:55] RamblingJosh_: it's so gnarly
[0:37:21] killerkoala345: shouldn't you be watching some fyrakk kill vods for prep
[0:37:33] simplepathwow: KEKW
[0:37:42] simplepathwow: you now know what not to do
[0:37:48] epilepticunicorn_: you arent ready until you can post your own
[0:37:49] Arisolo: wait Growl did you guys not kill it last night with Drogoh?
[0:37:54] AvalenaTV: btw do you MC the cultivist at first pull? or dont u bother
[0:38:22] nebounette: it is time to attack
[0:38:25] AvalenaTV: isnt it big for lust pull? 20% flat dmg and 50% attackspeed
[0:39:20] AvalenaTV: its a bit tricky to get the timings good but with petmoveto and mouseover casts its doable
[0:39:38] AvalenaTV: but i usually drop it after first pull and i never done higher than 26 :D
[0:40:39] Spongemunky: what’s the weakaura or addon that shows the targeted spells to the right of your char?
[0:41:38] TheSemiDutch: !hack
[0:41:40] Nightbot: Targeted spells weakaura: https://wago.io/_0klhzHfB
[0:41:49] Spongemunky: ah oki ty
[0:42:27] AvalenaTV: whats the "P:1.48"?
[0:43:10] RamblingJosh_: oh, clever
[0:43:12] epilepticunicorn_: the P is physical hits the M is magic hits
[0:43:46] AvalenaTV: thats actually smort
[0:44:13] ShadowLightVT: Do you realistically ever look at kick tracker/aoe stop assignment? Or is that mostly stuff that the tank uses when calling stops?
[0:44:13] UltimatellPT: Hey yumy, can u show current heal?
[0:44:21] AnnaXOXD: what's the WA for the casting enemies so it shows who it's targetting?
[0:44:27] AvalenaTV: so you only need to memorize the flat dmg of every oneshot in every keylevel? :D

[0:46:32] gargamelih2: Sanguine really made me realize they took shining force from us
[0:46:53] danaxvx: I did this key with this same comp earlier today
[0:47:20] AvalenaTV: @gargamelih2 "Because we feel priest has too impactful CC"
[0:47:26] ligament_champion: meoW
[0:47:31] AvalenaTV: and then they released evoker with 1 gazillion knocks
[0:47:43] gargamelih2: Now all we have left is fucking nothing instead

[0:50:00] Arisolo: seeing these pulls makes me super curious how aggressive they'll go with MDI
[0:50:14] Arisolo: like please put easy affixes on everbloom so we can just watch disgusting pulls
[0:50:30] AvalenaTV: fortified bolstering confirmed
[0:50:43] Vermalech: What up gents
[0:51:07] IAmSolari: fortified and bolstering both existing on the same week makes no sense to me
[0:51:13] epilepticunicorn_: MDI gonna be the entire first area onto boss
[0:51:22] AvalenaTV: lol
[0:51:24] lopik_: :D
[0:51:27] TheDauntlessBunny: ???

[0:51:29] sorenkje: xdd
[0:51:32] gargamelih2: They should make a special everbloom key with fortified bolstering sanguine bursting and raging and see how far they can push
[0:51:33] RamblingJosh_: o7
[0:51:35] AvalenaTV: that was critical hit of sanguine KEKW
[0:51:40] AvalenaTV: reset the boss completely
[0:51:54] d3rftree: KEKG
[0:51:58] jenkinsdonuttv: Boss used shadowmeld xdd

[0:59:19] zachl_: wait
[0:59:24] zachl_: i had to contribute to get the golden kappa?
[0:59:25] IAmSolari: I feel like I haven't watched a cat stream in a while... not a true yumytv superfan :(
[0:59:28] zachl_: god im so fuckin stupid
[0:59:30] unbelieversc2: dorki popping off
[0:59:39] Cobolt_: Kappa

[0:59:52] epilepticunicorn_: Kappa
[0:59:53] zachl_: bro i thought everyone there for the train got a golden kappa
[0:59:57] kamui_kirito7: Kappa
[0:59:58] IAmSolari: @justpeacealways no
[1:00:00] zachl_: i woulda contributed if i knew i had to
[1:00:05] zero_rawrxd: Kappa
[1:00:07] idkcrazed: Kappa
[1:00:08] justpeacealways: What does season finale mean then?
[1:00:20] SurfSalsa: if they don't kill it tonight they die
[1:00:23] IAmSolari: @justpeacealways of 'fyrakk dies or we die'
[1:00:28] epilepticunicorn_: @justpeacealways they all die if boss doesnt die
[1:00:30] zachl_: @justpeacealways finale of fyrakk prog, hopefully
[1:00:37] RamblingJosh_: season finale of gang activity
[1:00:45] IAmSolari: we don't even know what dungs they're doing next season yet
[1:00:48] justpeacealways: so its a gdisband ?
[1:00:57] justpeacealways: LUL
[1:00:59] SurfSalsa: season finale not series hopefully
[1:01:00] jenkinsdonuttv: @justpeacealways Raid stuff. It's Yumy's guild's last chance to kill mythic Fyrakk before they restructure it (or better ending: they kill Fyrakk tonight)
[1:01:05] Seitz501: Kappa
[1:01:05] zachl_: i mean we have a pretty good idea @IAmSolari
[1:01:21] OneTwoNightmareComing4You: !realm
[1:01:22] velidien: if it doesnt die tonight guild is done for the season. Drohgoh got MDI, the Mistweaver is leaving tomorrow, they have apped and been accepted to another guild. So even if they want to raid tomorrow they have to rent a MW
[1:01:48] IAmSolari: @zachl_ Have blizz said anything about it? or has it just been content creators speculating etc
[1:02:22] eb_farnum: oh lawd he comin
[1:02:27] epilepticunicorn_: 27 time
[1:02:28] zachl_: @zachl_ i mean its speculation- but we did get a 'revisiting dragonflight raids' : i highly highly doubt they dont do the 8-10 df dungeons in a season
[1:02:32] zachl_: it just wouldnt make sense
[1:02:50] Razdruid: do you only spread atonement via radiance?
[1:02:57] IAmSolari: @zachl_ god I hope it's the 8 DF dungeons without DOTI
[1:03:00] assumlng: it also doesnt make sense that we get to to the DF dungeons for only 1 season in the DF expansion
[1:03:11] discomancer1: they also mentioned that season 4 TGP will include "favorites from throughout dragonflight" or something to that effect
[1:03:27] zachl_: @Razdruid you can spread with pws or renew but radiance is obv more efficient
[1:03:33] zachl_: ideally you only apply with pws and radiance
[1:03:47] IAmSolari: @discomancer1 cant wait for a world first +50 SBG
[1:03:53] discomancer1: xD
[1:03:56] Ventorpoe: Ayo
[1:03:59] jenkinsdonuttv: @IAmSolari Uldaman, Sanguine Depths, Tol'dagor, Siege of Boralus, Grimrail (again), CoEN before nerfs, Old Hillsbrad Foothills. Make a true stinker season. All seasons will be good after this
[1:04:15] FrabjousDaze: hey there growl yumytvWave how goes dorkiLook is the dragon dead? Kappa
[1:04:27] Rampo123: start 30>29>28
[1:04:39] IAmSolari: @jenkinsdonuttv Old Hillsbrad Foothills M+ sounds like my idea of actual torture
[1:04:52] jenkinsdonuttv: @IAmSolari Forgot Violet Hold m+ for good measure
[1:04:54] FrabjousDaze: fyrrak? more like dragon deez nuts Kappa
[1:05:00] epilepticunicorn_: violet hold M+ is where its at
[1:05:04] discomancer1: add The Black Morass in there as well
[1:05:16] TSmarine: Any Fyrakk tn?
[1:05:18] jenkinsdonuttv: @discomancer1 True and real
[1:05:23] IAmSolari: deadmines m+
[1:05:26] rrimolix: which day ends the season?
[1:05:42] epilepticunicorn_: long time away
[1:05:45] RamblingJosh_: The cata version of deadmines would be fire
[1:05:51] rrimolix: k tks
[1:06:05] FrabjousDaze: @rrimolix its the season finale cause their guild detonates on reset
[1:06:45] AvalenaTV: wtf is this pull

[1:08:14] zachl_: it has to pop the bubble ventor OMEGALUL
[1:08:15] Ventorpoe: no
[1:08:17] IAmSolari: this kind of non ethical dps is why yumytv will always be the premier cat streamer
[1:08:19] Marenjok: ventor why werent you in my key yesterday with listerlean
