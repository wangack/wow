[1:21:03] MysticalOS: anyone expecting a world revamp hasn't been paying attention. just months ago blizzard was creating crisis maps. and from people I've heard from, stuff is still chopping blocked. ot think they have bandwidth to do another cata level world revamp. they do not

[1:22:14] Thoreya: formula starting to get stale, as a huge wow fan lol
[1:22:18] Galadeon: But but are we at least going to address the giant sword in the desert in 11.0?? 😈
[1:22:29] Rudric_Ice: @mavericks312 sure 1 month and ill prolly quit
[1:22:33] mavericks312: @galadeon what sword

[1:23:59] Thoreya: but proceed to make retail stale
[1:24:15] Galadeon: Leak. In the next expac there will be a snowy area, lava area, swamp area, and a major city.
[1:24:15] Rudric_Ice: i mean tow basically confirmed its real hes just not saying it cuz of the NDA stuff
[1:24:26] kyotoboss: @szble bro blizz wasn't realy nice to the pvp community the last years .. i feel that

[1:27:14] Rudric_Ice: this is why i feel retail is getting boring and formulaic classic + will be a good "breaking the wheel" thing for warcraft in general
[1:27:30] Rudric_Ice: if it happens
[1:27:50] ThoMeg94: @Rudric_Ice I think there's just way too many different things people expect C+ to be
[1:28:00] ThoMeg94: they can't get it right even if it happens

[1:28:55] cryptic898989: only the new generation push what's better.

[1:29:25] goofywizard: When is the new raid coming?
[1:29:27] Thoreya: classic + will prob be cool, i just dont have the patience to deal with the slow ass combat
[1:29:28] magemaster225: lotta giga nerfed trinkets last night
[1:29:30] DunzoCD: i just hope the classic plus combat isnt slow and boring like classic's tbh
[1:29:33] Erielle04: @cryptic898989 generation?
[1:29:41] mavericks312: @oasishydra I mean that’s a lot of classic players tbh
[1:29:42] kyotoboss: alot of peeps don't even want cata
[1:29:58] Beerplz: @Towelliee the whole "what if cata didn't happen" thing would actually blow me away if it happens
[1:30:00] Thoreya: they had surveys already about cata, its 100% happening
[1:30:01] Thoreya: lol
[1:30:06] Odonigan443: FR who is asking for cata classic
[1:30:06] Effin_Steffin: i thought it was gonna be a thing since they sent that survey
[1:30:10] Thoreya: anytime they have surveys, its happening
[1:30:14] mavericks312: @thoreya classic is way to slow for me to play anymore tbh
[1:30:17] RALMAZ: wanna leagion classic TPFufun
[1:30:23] Erielle04: cata is the really safe option, they have the code, really easy to spin up the servers
[1:30:25] szble: oh for sure classic cata is coming
[1:30:26] KaisenSiru: Wrong. I would prefer a Classic Cata over something like Wrath. Cata brought many great things that people are ignorant about. Or it was too hard for them KEKW
[1:30:33] Odonigan443: What would it be called?
[1:30:36] brewgamingtv: BFA classic when? rofl
[1:30:42] Oasishydra: To make it in person again they must have some good news, you can't go back to in person and announce starcraft mobile.
[1:30:44] cipusanx: metzen is the story guy
[1:30:44] mavericks312: Cata was actually a good xpac y’all gotta stop it lol
[1:30:45] Beet4: @brewgamingtv Can't wait!
[1:30:51] KiwiiZxx: id love classic + with no level increase and just more content
[1:30:54] Thoreya: @mavericks312 spamming frostbolt or sinister strike constantly just not for me. im 28, i still have good hand eye coordination LUL
[1:31:00] Kavieonn: Shadowlands classic is what im waiting for
[1:31:01] kyotoboss: shadowlands remake Kreygasm
[1:31:07] Odonigan443: Yall Crazy cata was litteral dog shit lol
[1:31:09] goofywizard: I cannot see Classic MoP happening
[1:31:17] Beerplz: @Towelliee what if we get cata classic but with different content ?
[1:31:23] Thoreya: gimme MOP, legion, and bfa classic
[1:31:27] Sollice: Morning
[1:31:36] Rudric_Ice: as tow said Cata+ might be a thing he heavily emphasized the "+" on cata
[1:31:36] mavericks312: @thoreya I’m not trying to go back to the days where using my wand is meta lol
[1:31:41] DotcomDUH: I didnt start playing till CATA. So I am happy they made Classic - Northrend.
[1:31:41] tlsmith3638: isnt metzen the same rank as colon ron?
[1:31:44] Odonigan443: Thats pretty true
[1:31:56] tlsmith3638: or the same type of job
[1:31:57] Sibo86: cata classic without the world sundering would be better
[1:32:07] cschimp: Would be the least popular classic imo
[1:32:10] Sollice: @Sibo86 Then its not really Cata is it?
[1:32:15] kyotoboss: @Sibo86 so cata without cata ?
[1:32:18] con_einstein: where
[1:32:35] love_eggplant: no
[1:32:37] love_eggplant: classic++
[1:32:37] KiwiiZxx: wotlk classic , classic era , HC classic
[1:32:55] Erielle04: @Val3rion legit looking, I wouldn't say its legiit, hee
[1:33:04] Rudric_Ice: Cata without the world revamp everything is the same but the WORLD is unchanged that could be CATA +
[1:33:12] Jeddek_: Do you think they will do Hardcore for ALL expacs?
[1:33:12] con_einstein: @Val3rion where
[1:33:18] Sibo86: @kyotoboss
[1:33:28] cschimp: Just need classic+ imo and that's all
[1:33:33] Oasishydra: Well we already know there's going to be SOM 2
[1:33:33] hercybrah: WoW 2 when? xD
[1:33:37] szble: itll just be cata minus the dungeon finder LUL
[1:33:39] Sibo86: @kyotoboss yeh
[1:33:41] Kavieonn: How long till Starcraft 3?
[1:33:42] magemaster225: they should probably blow up retail servers and make mega servers
[1:33:45] Erielle04: I think it will culminate in wow 2
[1:33:59] love_eggplant: its called classic awakened
[1:33:59] free0rda: I could see them having a COD/BF or MCC style client where you can login to toons from each version of the game, Classic, Retail, "Next"
[1:34:06] xHukk: @Towelliee bro..  ALL the streamers are calling it Classic+  lmfao
[1:34:17] Phil87z: I just want classic plus to have modern raiding mechanics so the classic players have to actually try
[1:34:18] Oasishydra: true LULW
[1:34:32] Rudric_Ice: the community made it up YEP
[1:34:40] Oasishydra: @Trixee89 even more people playing ngl
[1:34:47] BenInYa: when would you expect cata to release if it did? @Towelliee
[1:34:48] kjdocs: what a kick in the ballz if cata is the classic+
[1:34:49] jgentile93: WoW gamepass edition Kappa
[1:34:54] KaisenSiru: And I very much enjoyed the world revamp/destruction Deathwing wrought upon Azeroth. And the class changes really amping up the gameplay fun
[1:34:54] Broomba: its sad that the semantics and lingo is over riding the actual wow experience beyond retail.
[1:35:06] zelours: catai
[1:35:10] zelours: cata is just retail...
[1:35:22] KiwiiZxx: @askmeforbuff fr
[1:35:24] cschimp: @kjdocs Not really, they would just use it as a starting point to modify. But yeah I think vanilla would be a cooler starting point
[1:35:33] Moobot: Ask a moderator for permission before posting a link, @Val3rion (warning)
[1:35:35] Broomba: you say classic, i say classic plus KEKW lets call the whole thing off
[1:35:35] magemaster225: lich king already breaking classic guilds, content too hard
[1:35:40] Kavieonn: @jgentile93 Would blizzard lose alot of money if wow was available on gamepass?
[1:35:42] kyotoboss: @Sibo86 yeah but then you don't really want cata .. you want a product like cata ,cause without the world changes absolutly nothing would make sense :)
[1:35:46] cripplious: just have timewalking dovetail into classic character
[1:36:15] CardinalTX: Holley Longdale was in charge of Everquest for years and they started relaunching classic servers almost every year
[1:36:20] Rudric_Ice: lmao fextra's stream went from 35k to 5k KEKW
[1:36:21] flexxinchad: Theyve been talking bout classic plus since 19, 4 years later, still no announcement
[1:36:27] KaisenSiru: ICC patch was also basically the start of "retail" as people say.

[1:39:11] KiwiiZxx: @Rudric_Ice actually is it leaked like that?
[1:39:17] Broomba: i get excited for blizzcon and the news when it happens on the day, and not before
[1:39:23] hisfrankness: I didn't hear about a D4 expansion! :O

[1:39:40] Shorpa: I'm excited for hanging out in your twitch chat at the opening ceremony @Towelliee
[1:40:03] PotbellyGoat: no new expansion confirmed
[1:40:03] kyotoboss: @Kavieonn thats a good question , maybe there are using Immortal as kind of an testing grounds to implement later into d4
[1:40:09] mavericks312: Rudric out here spreading fake news
[1:40:17] Sollice: @mavericks312 Whats new

[1:42:14] HaxzorJimDuggan: bobby probably couldnt name the current expansion
[1:42:20] cripplious: devs come out and say we got nothing
[1:42:24] 91Niki: The only thing Bobby does is ask "how can we make more money"
[1:42:25] SamuraiWillZ916: Glad stance
[1:42:26] Inthezonewow: Fury has been my main for years, but gave it up in SL. Feels crap 3 years on

[1:44:49] goosejamss: @Kavieonn nah they really improved it and added an end game. there was nothing to do besides build before
[1:44:56] kyotoboss: 1 or 2 more support speccs would be great aswell
[1:45:00] Sollice: Actually almost a decade
[1:45:12] Keyastaron_: itll be fineeee
[1:45:17] 91Niki: The only thing Microsoft did to Minecraft was making it accessible. And if you enjoy the old launcher, you can still use that

[1:46:05] Rudric_Ice: microsoft fucked halo not minecraft get your facts straight
[1:46:06] KaisenSiru: Exactly. Things change over the years? No way!
[1:46:12] Inthezonewow: Bring back Artifact Weapons towRee
[1:46:13] xHukk: boomers who can't accept change.  Thats what it takes to "ruin" something
[1:46:18] 91Niki: @foshanks I think you misunderstood what I just said
[1:46:23] mavericks312: MS ruined halo not Minecraft
[1:46:24] tlsmith3638: prety much
[1:46:28] hisfrankness: Towelliee you're so cheeky! =P haha
[1:46:41] Yagr6: do you agree or disagree that 343 ruined halo after taking over from bungie?

[1:47:18] firehawk73: How dare you bring facts to an argument? Kappa
[1:47:19] 91Niki: If you think they ruined a game by requiring you to log into your microsoft account, you need help KEKW
[1:47:22] foshanks: @91Niki NotLikeThis NotLikeThis NotLikeThis
[1:48:12] lumaday: its kinda the last awful affix remaining
[1:48:15] Rudric_Ice: so tow do u think 343 did not ruin the halo franchise but it was players who ruined it for them ?
[1:48:18] Kavieonn: @91Niki will you be saying that if they require you to log in microsoft account for Wow?
[1:48:31] zysmos: remove sanguine storming and spiteful and we gucci
[1:48:39] ThoMeg94: Sanguine ruined m+!!1!
[1:48:42] 91Niki: @Kavieonn Yeah, cuz I don't give two shits. As long as I can play. Who cares what I need to connect my account to rofl
[1:48:55] Calphurnious: @Kavieonn Instead of battlenet?
[1:49:09] Sollice: Niki.....That's the hill they will die on lol
[1:49:29] kyotoboss: gogo pre pot
[1:49:29] Sollice: Hopefully they aren't prime members who get prime loot and have to link their Twitch account to EA, MS, HI Rez etc etc etc
[1:49:59] 91Niki: So what if you need to log into a microsoft account to play wow? How is it different than logging into your bnet account? OH NO WHAT IF YOU HAVE TO LOG INTO BOTH... HOW SCAARY AND SPOOKY FailFish

[1:50:39] 91Niki: @Yagr6 We're not talking about console
[1:50:39] foshanks: "Another account... no problem". Updates 100 page account PW keeper. NotLikeThis Kappa LUL
[1:50:50] MrBr1ghtsid3: In all honesty, the fewer places to log in and play, the better, but I suspect aggregates like GeForce Now, Steam and GOG help towards that goal.
[1:51:51] kyotoboss: BL in 10
[1:52:15] 91Niki: @Yagr6 You implied that we lose our minds if we talk wow on xbox. Nobody ever said that LUL
[1:52:18] foshanks: There is no rolling back "create account for X" now. All we can hope for is less info required.
[1:52:18] Po_Savage: @Yagr6 what does wow to xbox mean if it isnt console? whats with some of yalls replies to the mods, look silly lmao
[1:52:28] DunzoCD: "thank you for resetting my grieftorch"
[1:52:30] redspike15: amazing bl
[1:52:44] KiwiiZxx: wow on game pass would be good for the game no?
[1:52:54] Molvonos: @KiwiiZxx Not really
[1:52:54] Zettabyte: Gamepass being in WoW Kappa
[1:52:58] SinicalDev: They might expand the F2P limits but ESO+ isn't on GamePass, neither will WoW.
[1:53:01] HaxzorJimDuggan: its my copium and i want it now
[1:53:05] Kavieonn: @KiwiiZxx wouldn't they lose money?
[1:53:10] mavericks312: @kiwiizxx no they would lose a ton of money

[1:53:43] Sollice: Ending that conversation for a bit lol
[1:53:43] zysmos: Imo Microsoft is gonna let blizzard the f alone just like Tencent does with Riot
[1:53:49] HaxzorJimDuggan: people need to reverse their thinking about game pass, the more likely scenario is the game pass coming to the WoW sub
[1:53:49] 91Niki: That fucking sentence didn't even make fucking sense ROFL
[1:53:51] KiwiiZxx: yah but wow goes f2p with battles pass so it makes up for it
[1:53:53] mavericks312: @reznr what lol they would lose millions
[1:53:54] KiwiiZxx: kidding
[1:53:54] Irahh: Irahh subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 4 months! 
[1:53:56] Calphurnious: @KiwiiZxx I think so depending on the data. They'll have the data to show how many WoW players have a game pass sub. If most wow players don't have a game pass then it would make sense a biit
[1:53:56] Po_Savage: @91Niki shits wild man xD
[1:53:58] Shrenko: the Diablo drop overlay is still on
[1:54:00] Molvonos: Yea, too many issues with that one.
[1:54:12] SamuraiWillZ916: It would increase micro transactions
[1:54:14] Dankmcnasty: what is gamepass?
[1:54:14] Kavieonn: What about Call of Duty on Gamepass?
[1:54:20] Beerplz: Lets get back on topic with the leaks :)
[1:54:25] DunzoCD: thinking they will give up the token for battlepass LUL
[1:54:26] Jeddek_: I did try to let you know about it lol
[1:54:27] mavericks312: @kiwiizxx look at how much money the token makes lol
[1:54:29] foshanks: I just got PTSD for WoW battlepass comment NotLikeThis
[1:54:31] 91Niki: @Po_Savage People we wilding all the time in twitch chat LUL
[1:54:37] Rudric_Ice: hope we get some news about reviving Heroes of the Storm back after back 2 back balance patches i can see a bleak of hope maybe
[1:54:37] SinicalDev: ESO is already on Xbox and they didn't bother adding ESO+ to GP. It's not happening...
[1:54:45] 91Niki: Hey if that means more players in wow, I am all for it
[1:54:49] Sollice: I would love to play CoD on gamepass. Not really in to the multi player aspect but I would like to play the single player. Would be great to not pay 69 for a few hours of content
[1:54:52] Kavieonn: @Beerplz What leaks?
[1:54:52] KiwiiZxx: @mavericks312 so true
[1:55:03] Frosted2319: i dont see wow on game pass unless the got rid of subs and thats what keeps it alive and they arent giving free expansions
[1:55:04] Po_Savage: @91Niki you aint lying, i talk my shit sometimes but damn if some of these dudes werent talking in circles
[1:55:04] MysticalOS: I see wow on xbox within a year, quote me on this. the things I know, and barriers that used to be there, aren't there under MS
[1:55:06] Keyastaron_: np glad to help
[1:55:16] Beerplz: @Beerplz the mmo champion leaks , they leaked the 4 new zones for the expansion apperantly LuL
[1:55:23] Jeddek_: I would 100% pay GAMEPASS for WoW sub, are you kidding me??
[1:55:23] Keyastaron_: ill try and gear up more to help xD
[1:55:32] MysticalOS: game pass is iffy, but i def see a console port in not far future
[1:55:36] HaxzorJimDuggan: @Sollice im guessing since they already sold so many preorders that adding the current one to gamepass would be a dick move, so my prediction it starts with the next year release
[1:55:43] SinicalDev: @MysticalOS WoW is too reliant on addons at the moment, they won't put it on console unless they change the fundamental game design
[1:55:44] 91Niki: @Po_Savage Sometimes I wonder if people read back what they type before posting it LUL
[1:55:47] cschimp: A ton of the younger generation will learn about it for the first time
[1:55:54] Sollice: @HaxzorJimDuggan Oh yea I wouldn't expect anything until 2023

[1:56:01] Rudric_Ice: TBH they can make Classic WoW available for gamepass  its pretty simple and retail can be for PC only
[1:56:02] SinicalDev: We're likely to see more non-WoW Warcraft based games instead
[1:56:06] bypized: You just put WoW Token in Microsoft Store
[1:56:08] mavericks312: We aren’t gonna see changes for like 5 yrs
[1:56:12] Frosted2319: id love to play wow again but is a little pricey rn
[1:56:19] MysticalOS: @MysticalOS nothing stops xbox from having addons, the biggest console port issue is SONY wouldn't allow addons....see where this is going now that MS owns it? :D
[1:56:27] Kavieonn: Will Microsoft put blizzard servers in Azure Cloud?
[1:56:38] nightbringer000: Woah there. was just a MASS Shooting om Maine 29 minutes ago
[1:56:38] KiwiiZxx: or phil spencer comes down from the ceiling at blizzcon with a sign that says wow 2 coming to a monitor near you
[1:56:49] bypized: Putting WoW in Game Pass would just open The Battle Net launcher that’s it
[1:56:50] xRags4: Are you saying that it's just us players that keep coming back because we have a problem?! WoW hooked everyone but idk anyone that is starting as a first timer these days.
[1:56:50] Energyzer9301: They probably wont care too much for WoW on consoles. they already have ESO on their right? makes sense if they wanna promot that as their console MMO
[1:56:58] keeindordel: warcraft netflix series
[1:56:59] 91Niki: @KiwiiZxx wow 2 towCopium
[1:57:00] keeindordel: plzz
[1:57:02] foshanks: Diablo just padded Blizz for any dev want they have
[1:57:03] Sollice: @nightbringer000 That was last night
[1:57:05] Po_Savage: @91Niki im sure you see it a bit more often than needed with spergs in here sometimes too hahaha
[1:57:11] kyotoboss: How is the Corehound going , doing progress ?
[1:57:12] Wulfgrym: good morning, microsoft needs to do its own work to understand the cashflow of blizzard
[1:57:26] xRags4: WoW Netflix series with Vin Diesel as Thrall
[1:57:34] Sollice: @Wulfgrym They already understand it. Otherwise they wouldn't have purchased
[1:57:39] keeindordel: @xRags4 bro.. just no..
[1:57:50] Shrenko: STOP IT emotes gone?!?! noooo
[1:58:09] nightbringer000: \ahhh sorry just got home. from work...  just saw the time line... thx ... crazy stuff....
[1:58:10] SinicalDev: I just want them to revive HOTS with Microsoft franchise heroes added
[1:58:21] MechanicalMelee: Do you think blizzard will announce their new IP for odyssey this blitz on?
[1:58:27] Kavieonn: How come no one mentions starcraft 2?
[1:58:32] Wulfgrym: @Sollice yeah i agree im just saying they need to do that, but that doesn't mean they don't want to change things either. all about profits for the shareholders.
[1:58:38] DeanoTV: @KiwiiZxx holy copium KEKW
[1:58:47] Korupcija_: not sure if anyone told you, but your game is freezing every 30-60 sec(happened in diablo 4 as well)
[1:58:49] Sollice: @SinicalDev I am hoping this happens. HoTS getting a big patch soon
[1:58:52] bypized: That’s such a low number of people tho
[1:58:54] boneknife09: what farms what they be doing to earn 350k if they not a full time wow player?
[1:59:04] Wulfgrym: @Sollice they wouldn't of made a 69billion dollar acquisition without their home work LUL
[1:59:07] asmodai4823: @Korupcija_ yep very noticable
[1:59:11] Calphurnious: All I want out of the merger is that they revert WC3 changes so I can download the original 500mb file
[1:59:21] Sollice: The freezing is on our end
[1:59:27] Sollice: I have it also dunno what it is
[1:59:31] PidiaP: He knows towTinfoil
[1:59:33] Rudric_Ice: i rather work 2 extra hours than farming gold ingame and buy a token instead
[1:59:37] KiwiiZxx: @DeanoTV just jokes
[1:59:48] Korupcija_: @Sollice ye, only his stream
[1:59:48] Sollice: I did a full ddu driver reinstall and other things and its not fixed
[2:00:06] bypized: @towelliee is your progress on Rumble going to carry over to launch or are you just practicing for live gameplay at Blizzcon?
[2:00:06] asmodai4823: its only the gameplay not his face cam
[2:00:07] Kavieonn: Does Diablo immortal make more money than Diablo 4?
[2:00:08] Chenneth: Has Towliee decided what tank he will play more in 10.2?
[2:00:28] SinicalDev: @bypized It's already released mate, just not in every country
[2:00:32] Keyastaron_: LUL JUST FARM MATS AND FLIP THE AH
[2:00:39] Sicknessqt: I make that gold in a day and i have full time job and university KEKW ppl are just lazy
[2:00:39] Shrenko: @SinicalDev looks like its happening. They tweetet just 10 days before Blizzcon and it was their first tweet in over a year. And they are actually doing changes to the game, with a decent large patch, and they said they abandoned the game completely so. My guess is that they are maybe getting ready for a Steam release?
[2:00:40] Kapers_: You should check the amount of gold flying around in even Era and Wotlk, it is insane
[2:00:53] boneknife09: iv been playing wow for about 8months now i still have not farmed enough gold to buy a token
[2:00:53] Kapers_: an infinite resource
[2:01:13] foshanks: Ewww D Immortal WutFace WutFace
[2:01:22] Viroth: immortal is raking it in with the whales
[2:01:32] Hebi2Cold: Yeah my cousin doesn’t even play wow anymore, just plays immortal on tablet lol

[2:05:03] brewgamingtv: yeah
[2:05:09] Molvonos: At that rate, just give me stat sticks.
[2:05:12] Kavieonn: @91Niki oh i thought they were out i remember someone mentioning them like a year ago
[2:05:44] Sollice:  For those who were having stream issues, try taking off low latency mode on stream. I just turned it off and no stutters, but he is standing still dunno if it will work when he starts doing combat
[2:05:52] Wildsmasher: because yours was real

[2:06:58] 91Niki: Either way idk that anyone knows when those cards are coming out
[2:07:41] mavericks312: Casters get ducked having to farm the back end dungeon
[2:07:46] VinnieK_: does the trinket work together with purgatory on blood dk or do they both just pop
[2:08:18] SinicalDev: I can't find them anywhere in the UK - US shipping is super expensive
[2:08:33] Sollice: @SinicalDev They arent out yet so dont get scammazed
[2:08:42] shosindar: hi

[2:09:38] SinicalDev: @SinicalDev Yeah UD don't list any UK/European resellers, only US/CA so just gonna wait
[2:09:38] Rudric_Ice: can they add a solo m+ like visions ?

[2:39:32] MysticalOS: see I found that patch bad, but that's cause I wasn't raiding or doing M+, and they added 6 months more content only to end game, while outdoor/world was literally just 6 more months of season 3
[2:39:42] Nebulizer87: yeah easy is so subjective it took most guilds the same avg time to get sark down
[2:39:46] brewgamingtv: Fated was good. I wish they kept the vendor around for them rare drop's tho
[2:39:50] SinicalDev: @LeXieSterling Legion and BFA were august/sept

[2:40:35] brewgamingtv: open world maybe what mystical means
[2:40:49] kimmo_gaming: i would love a nice mini raid in the next expansion, quick in and out
[2:40:53] MysticalOS: 10.2 was even planned 8 weeks but got pushed because of the blizzcon conflict with raid,
[2:41:03] Effin_Steffin: towTinfoil
[2:41:08] Rudric_Ice: good put all the dev time into the next expansion this one is already over
[2:41:36] SinicalDev: itll be 8 weeks from the raid launch week i bet

[2:42:23] MysticalOS: or they could do it at 6-7 weeks, use 10.2.5s original schedule, since 10.2 was still done in it's original time table, it was RC ahead of schedule because of it's original schedule.

[2:43:01] Vercross92: Do you think they'd do a patch 10.3 to something similar like they did at the end of shadowlands with fated raids, maybe like a 4 month shorter patch to hold us over to the next expac
[2:43:21] SinicalDev: @Vercross92 they already said they would

[2:44:02] mewkittymon: 3 months I think 🤔
[2:44:40] Rudric_Ice: they can do a Fated season with different raids from legion BFA that would be cool

[2:45:03] ParfumAmerican: i hope next xpac will be linear progression from then on, they can't make it bigger that this
[2:45:19] MysticalOS: honestly i think things are so up in air now with new ownership. after all dragonflight was released at least 3 weeks before it should have been due to ABK pressure. despite many on dev team being against it. so we can't really use that as a great example of release pacing under MS. but who knows. they might want a little more polish this time
[2:45:45] Beerplz: @Towelliee and then they continued through the whole of alpha and never changed anything with covenants KEKW
[2:45:50] Shrenko: a long time
[2:45:52] Jeddek_: Im pretty sure I restored items from like a year ago
[2:45:53] Fleymour: wow item restoration so bad kiyoonSadge
[2:45:58] DunzoCD: i would like 18-month expansion cycles as long as it means we are consistently getting content
[2:46:11] DunzoCD: like we are now
[2:46:33] otecshadow: I really hope this leak isn't real. Dragonflight 2.0 is not what we need :\
[2:46:34] mewkittymon: You can only rector 1 every 30 days.
[2:46:38] MysticalOS: oh i have no doubt we'll get a fated thing
[2:46:38] Irahh: Hey @Towelliee I did a xmog roulette earlier, but you missed it =/
[2:46:41] MysticalOS: it doesn't take much
[2:46:45] MysticalOS: it's reusing content
[2:46:46] Elff11: 3 or 4
[2:46:57] danchii_: it was 3
[2:47:02] danchii_: 2 originally and a 3rd to help
[2:47:03] SinicalDev: They said that they want to mix in open world features for fated in DF
[2:47:12] Rudric_Ice: no give me fated raids from legion

[2:47:45] DunzoCD: primal molten something prolly
[2:47:46] Jinx1348: MC Fate yikes!
[2:47:53] SinicalDev: Not to mention the next Classic release will probably be middle of next year to tide people over before 11.0
[2:47:54] MysticalOS: and I predict still that fated will be all 8 dragonflight dungeons. cause they won't want to use up a bunch of future old dungeons, ones that likely will take more resources to update/test. when they can just say 'ok, fated is the 3 raids and the 8 OG dungeons)
[2:48:12] Jinx1348: Fated*
[2:48:13] tlsmith3638: Occulus coing to M+ 10.3 just watch
[2:48:18] tlsmith3638: coming*
[2:48:20] MysticalOS: a full dragonflight world tour
[2:48:35] Dudutoolbox: so is dragonflight gonna be a short1 year something xpac?
[2:48:56] mavericks312: @dudutoolbox no what lol next xpac won’t be out till next year
[2:49:02] KaisenSiru: anniesHmm
[2:49:12] jure__: vip mystical? HYPERS
[2:49:19] Dudutoolbox: @mavericks312 interesting
[2:49:23] SinicalDev: vip deez nuts
[2:49:27] dinomiyte: I dont really inderatand all the "classic" release. Qhy are they releasing the game again. Makes no sense
[2:49:28] Dudutoolbox: @mavericks312 so we getting new raids before than?
[2:49:50] mavericks312: @dudutoolbox nah after 10.2 it will be a fated season most likely
[2:49:54] chewyy514: fated is sick to get all bis items at mythic ilvl for next patch

[2:51:17] Elff11: ye
[2:51:19] Gruffian: double shadowflame
[2:51:23] 07biby: da fuq is an embelishment?
[2:51:27] Gruffian: or shadowflame and belt
[2:51:32] Nebulizer87: isn't shadowflame getting nerfed
[2:51:59] WytChapp: all embellishments nerfed by 30%
[2:52:01] SinicalDev: @07biby When you change the truth slightly for your own gain
[2:52:20] Elff11: next patch Shadowflame gets nerfed
[2:52:40] deckardblade: uh did anyone randomly get 2k coins on rumble for a bug?
[2:52:44] thegreatdestroyer27607: yeah keep it short and sweet but good
[2:52:56] WytChapp: Sporecloak isnt getting big nerf tho i think it was just for absorb shield
[2:53:02] Nebulizer87: id have to look into it ive been lazy, but i assume everyone wears sporecloak
[2:53:16] MasterNewt: Too bad this content does nothing but sours the taste of the expansion and drives people away with terrible storytelling and even worse dialogues.
[2:53:32] MysticalOS: yeah the only thing that hurt dragonflight, is shadowlands
[2:53:41] WytChapp: @masternewt i enjoy the content
[2:53:42] MysticalOS: the amount of players that just didn't come back
[2:53:49] mavericks312: Bro DF story is actually good stop it
[2:53:52] thewozardofiz: there's a story?
[2:53:54] breadwilton: ya I cant get any of my friends to play again :(
[2:53:56] LeXieSterling: I just let they would allow us to pick an exp and keep our tone there until we want to move on. Like FF does.
[2:54:13] mavericks312: DF is having the legion effect after WoD
[2:54:13] CardinalTX: When i want story i play FFXIV, ooooor even some SWtOR
[2:54:15] cappei: I give exactly 0 fucks about the story, unless it it so terribly bad that it's hard to ignore how awful it is, aka. Shadowlands
[2:54:20] Nebulizer87: helping some casuals raid norm opened my eyes up to just how 'casual' they can be

[2:54:50] WytChapp: @Nebulizer87 theres such different levels of casual for wow it hurts
[2:54:50] MysticalOS: lets be real legion was bad at start too. artifact knowledge was done poor with no account wide systems yet. artifact power grind was bad. and legendary targeted aquisition was a mess. people remember legion remember how it ended, not how it began
[2:55:10] love_eggplant: cuz SL was during corona
[2:55:12] crymeog: thast because shadowlands was coded by the last good coder at blizzard

[2:55:43] MasterNewt: So everybody is ignoring storytelling but they jizz on the cinematics only to what ... just do 650 runs of the same dungeons for 2 years and nothing else matters? Damn, that's some sad approach to entertainment.
[2:55:45] crymeog: btw, i heard blizzard owes that guy money, but then they sold to microsoft, how will that effect the outstanding debt blizzard already owed?
[2:55:46] WhatYeti: Put WoW in game pass and they'll get a bunch new subs that they can try to milk

[2:56:00] Rudric_Ice: BFA was good with keeping the players retention
[2:56:01] pruteee: Did towellie seen the leaks about the 4 picture of avaloren ?
[2:56:03] cappei: @MysticalOS End Legion is goated, but yeah. Start was rough, and the only reason more people don't complain about it, is because the previous expansion was WoD
[2:56:07] ParfumAmerican: they game got a little to fast as apm for some classes
[2:56:10] Masqerader: @sharkcatzero that would lose them money lol
[2:56:11] Nebulizer87: this next xpac launch should do a lot better
[2:56:13] Rudric_Ice: but it was bad for casual players
[2:56:21] Thoreya: @pruteee yes
[2:56:26] mavericks312: @sharkcatzero token makes way more then gamepass for WoW stop it
[2:56:31] timmythegamertv: Active users is king, LUL incoming game pass lets go!
[2:56:33] pruteee: What did he think about that?
[2:56:44] mavericks312: @timmythegamertv wrong that would lose koney

[2:56:49] mavericks312: Money*
[2:56:52] strike879: during covid shadowlands times guildies had 15 min workdays that they did during M+ they were im gonna mute the mic i have a meeting
[2:56:53] LeXieSterling: I am sorry but what does faded mean.
[2:56:56] WhatYeti: @Masqerader At the start yes, but I think if they made it like a 6 month sub once they could grab peoples interests and hold them for way longer than 6 months
[2:57:08] DunzoCD: @sharkcatzero i dont think putting it on gamepass would get as many more players as you think, most people already have formulated opinions of wow and making it more accessible wont change that
[2:57:19] timmythegamertv: @mavericks312 Sometimes it isn't about money.. you can always work other levers to make money
[2:57:20] mavericks312: @sharkcatzero again wrong the WoW token makes way more then gamepass would alone
[2:57:30] Thoreya: emassirys, visions, essences, some islands, corruption grind..miss that ish
[2:57:31] dammit_odra: @masternewt I think most people are playing for the mindless escapism/romp. Personally, I hold that storytelling standard to a book series, but not for a game that has been around for 20 years.
[2:57:31] Shorpa: Shorpa subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 8 months! 
[2:57:32] Masqerader: @sharkcatzero it would be a huge loss of money and not worth it.
[2:57:35] Keyastaron_: im back whjat i miss
[2:57:35] WhatYeti: @DunzoCD Fair enough
[2:57:37] theDirtyon3: I loved BfA but I am also a mount collector along with raider
[2:57:41] mavericks312: @sharkcatzero also the game is 20 yrs old whoever wanted to play wow has played it already
[2:57:51] Keyastaron_: gonna make the rings now?
[2:58:02] mavericks312: @timmythegamertv you don’t buy a company to lose money what lol
[2:58:06] Keyastaron_: ahhh
[2:58:07] WytChapp: @mavericks312 not true comepletely took me 18 years before i was able to
[2:58:24] Gruffian: Haste/crit
[2:58:26] WhatYeti: @mavericks312 I'm not saying your not right lol, I was just saying it could possibly bring some new eyes to the game even if its only a temporary sub on Game Pass. I get your point
[2:58:32] Keyastaron_: Haste; Versatility >= Critical Strike; Mastery.
[2:58:34] moistbuthardbread: @Towelliee do you think the next expansion will keep the current crafting system?
[2:58:35] timmythegamertv: @mavericks312 Agreed but subs isn't the only way to make money..
[2:58:53] Rudric_Ice: why are people so against the idea of wow going to gamepass ?
[2:59:11] mavericks312: @timmythegamertv right but putting it on gamepass kills the WoW token which makes them millions on its own
[2:59:37] Bullypoppin: Flavor pocket
[2:59:40] brewsuadeshoes: Flavor pocket
[2:59:40] DunzoCD: flavor pocket
[3:00:02] Nebulizer87: it will spike back up soon
[3:00:14] timmythegamertv: @mavericks312 Sure no token, but what happens if they stopped it being for a sub redemption and just used it as a way for people to legitimately buy gold.  Things change
[3:00:53] strike879: one thing they really need to do is instead of a 12 month sub its a 12 month package similair to the boat back in BfA
[3:00:58] thegreatdestroyer27607: evergreen baby
[3:00:59] Gruffian: Cant craft cross server can you?
[3:01:04] DunzoCD: i hope we can respec crafting, it feels so bad to put some points in the wrong spec
[3:01:18] moistbuthardbread: @Towelliee as a returning player the game is the best its been in a long time. I hope they keep the crafting/crests and add to it.
[3:01:18] mavericks312: @timmythegamertv this is where if it ain’t broke don’t fox it comes in especially with the token
[3:01:23] TheGiant99: They need to make the crafting where you just make your own stuff....I shouldn't have to hunt down somebody to make my item
[3:01:25] Calphurnious: What's the crest system? I haven't played since launch month
[3:01:37] Keyastaron_: yea you have to be on the same server
[3:01:49] DunzoCD: need to put the spark in
[3:01:50] Irahh: put the spark in
[3:01:51] strike879: respec is so easy to abuse which is probably why they dont want to
[3:01:52] WytChapp: gotta click spark first
[3:02:12] timmythegamertv: @mavericks312 Just because something isn't broken, doesn't mean it's the best you could be doing.

[3:03:53] WytChapp: its huge
[3:04:00] Keyastaron_: @Towelliee  when i was working at my job at a bacon factory i was pressing taking the hooks off the bacon bellies are a bitch and the first day i did that my arms hurt when i rotated em
[3:04:02] cyberratt: sporecloak is a good dps cloak now

[3:04:15] thegreatdestroyer27607: less of a cheat death but more survivability now with all the verse
[3:04:21] Elff11: I gives like 300 versa at 447 when above 70% hp in 10.2 @Towelliee
[3:04:28] WytChapp: Using it on evoker devs make it where you wont die imminently

[3:37:19] duffluv22: The jailer knows whats coming
[3:37:44] BoezIRL: hello there towHAMUP
[3:37:45] LeXieSterling: If they bring new content to classic do you thing they will charge subscription charge for that new content?
[3:37:50] duffluv22: Mist
[3:37:54] dracullus: nah, Shadowlands was so obvious people even made fake leaks with same name
[3:38:14] Inthezonewow: As corny and shitty it would have been, I still we wish we "woke up" at the end of BFA fighting Nzoth and SL didnt happen LUL
[3:38:29] Wulfgrym: @sifer007 metzen will be the final god of the wow universe ultimate battle
[3:38:37] Lintgamer: nOWP
[3:38:51] raldrik: Wrath continued .. $50 DLC
[3:39:02] yohover: good luck on them trying to sell something like that to the "NO CHANGES" crowd that still (albeit small) exists
[3:39:05] HaxzorJimDuggan: candies gonna shit a brick if that happens
[3:39:20] Rudric_Ice: sure u can charge me 30 bucks u already doin that in WoW stores for a mount
[3:39:23] LeXieSterling: Ya if it is new content.
[3:39:28] sifer007: @Wulfgrym LUL
[3:39:31] daxamillion90: If add new zones, quests, dungeons, raids and made the progression horizontal and not vertical, $30 ain’t bad
[3:39:34] dright424: I think if they do a Classic + they require you to buy the retail xpac to convert the classic only players to retail
[3:39:36] xRykku: Id love to see 2 things in classic. The model updates and the AH updates
[3:39:37] elhondro: they will not do classic+ for free that is 100% sure
[3:40:26] dracullus: imo all work for classic should be adding quests/content for Classic Era leveling (not endgame!) cause it's easily where classic is strongest
[3:40:55] arcantio123: feel like classic and even HC was so successful amongst casuals (at least for a while) so classic/wotlk+ will happen. more subscriptions or at least not unsubbing.
[3:41:05] duffluv22: Do people really like the grid of classic or the leveling of retail?
[3:41:32] sycnessx: hashtag no changes! :D
[3:41:35] daxamillion90: @duffluv22 it’s the sense of accomplishment, it feels good,
[3:41:46] DunzoCD: i like what they did with the fog, it makes flying over the old world feel a big bigger
[3:41:55] DunzoCD: bit*
[3:41:56] arcantio123: wow's lucky they already have a sub model so effectively have a game pass
[3:42:03] XLcoj: Did you guys discuss the leaked avalorn stuff?
[3:42:05] DampFadda: They'll do new ruleset servers
[3:42:18] herzlustafir: 72% drop... fuck
[3:42:24] Rudric_Ice: nah keep the old models that what yanks the chain for us classic players
[3:42:24] c0mmander_starscream: Bli$$ Free slootSmug
[3:42:24] DampFadda: Just like EQ did. Holly is going to take the same gameplan that worked for EQ for 15 years to WoW classic
[3:42:25] Moobot: For 10% off go to -> https://gameradvantage.com/?ref=TOWEL or use code "TOWEL" at checkout!
[3:42:30] daxamillion90: Do something with wrath would be sick
[3:42:32] LeXieSterling: Would be nice to see them release content for those that they wanted to but coudn't
[3:42:34] dracullus: pretty pointless since its all side content, in 11.0 main path is exiles reach -> dragon isles -> av.. new continent, I would rather expansion with fresh Kalimdor/EK in the future
[3:42:36] krayaal: classic + is dragonflight but no flying mounts
[3:42:57] Noshpan: EverQuest 2 has that option
[3:43:04] arcantio123: agree they HAVE to have old/new model swap even if its a separate download like the better graphics for D4
[3:43:21] Rudric_Ice: sure im fine with options and remove flying while at it
[3:43:24] DampFadda: EQ 1 / 2 both have that option, super easy to do especially since D4 does it
[3:43:27] Maydie6066: @Towelliee with DF bringing both a new race and class, do you think 11.0 will have neither a new race nor class?
[3:43:27] Moobot: towHAMUP Follow Towelliee on twitter so you can be in the know at all times! | twitter.com/towelthetank towKawaii
[3:43:51] daxamillion90: The classic hype is nuts tbh
[3:43:55] krayaal: dedicated twitch viewers to watch streamers die
[3:44:09] DampFadda: Wrath classic was a dungheap
[3:44:23] DampFadda: The fact they didn't do anything to address the 10/25 man issue making guilds hate life was very dumb
[3:44:27] izabeL: No way ERA is more popular than WOTLK Classic
[3:44:29] elhondro: classic hardcore has more players then wrath classic Ithing
[3:44:33] Rudric_Ice: tbc and classic was peak wrath was bad
[3:44:34] DampFadda: The roster boss in Wrath was undefeated
[3:44:35] daxamillion90: Especially if they add onto classic with content and shit, it creat subs and players
[3:44:38] lithium364: would you race change if you could play as an tall dwarf from avaloren?
[3:44:39] sifer007: Nothing they can do tbh

[3:45:34] gmike66: they already have taht?
[3:45:34] daxamillion90: I don’t think tbc was that good tbh. Wrath made every class feel complete
[3:45:57] DunzoCD: i think runescape does that, separates the categories
[3:45:59] raldrik: yeah moving the wow category closer to the top is better for all wow streamers
[3:46:00] daxamillion90: Plus all the dungeons sucked ass in tbc, straight up just bad
[3:46:27] gmike66: they have wow classic hardcore section already
[3:46:27] dright424: didn't they split the category once already and then put them back together because it went so bad for one of the categories
[3:46:52] arcantio123: classic HC servers are still have huge pop. it's fun basically a roguelike/roguelite since you send your gold to an alt. when you die you have a bunch of gold to gear up quickly
[3:47:06] CordovaGC: Once firelands comes out for cata (if they do cata classic) it's going to be the tits
[3:47:30] Meanseason: now they all stream on KIK .
[3:47:35] DampFadda: Firelands was AMAZING

[3:57:51] Brodih_: happy for Blizz!
[3:57:51] Wulfgrym: scalpers getting wrecked what a perfect time in life
[3:57:51] kirbyfan1: did they offer more tickets than previously?
[3:57:53] Jarlan23: yeah why do you think that is? is it just because you can watch all of it for free online now?
[3:57:55] Shrenko: I want to go but that is so expensive, all the way from Norway
[3:58:00] Nokterian: I looked at the price and i was like hell nah

[3:59:11] DampFadda: @daxamillion90 ok that's not terrible, whoever said 2k up top is cray lol
[3:59:18] thegreatdestroyer27607: i wouldnt want to go if I was guarantied a spot inside
[3:59:19] PigPenLen: this is going to be a blizz and priviledged folk convention
[3:59:21] kirbyfan1: the price is too high
[3:59:27] strike879: if it were in EU i would go but cba to go to US
[3:59:36] daxamillion90: Blizzcon sold out before blizzcon was announced
[3:59:53] HaxzorJimDuggan: people were trying to buy tickets just to see metallica that year
[3:59:54] arcantio123: didn't they used to have blizzcon EU also?
