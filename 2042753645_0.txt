[0:32:56] PhenomRom: healing doesnt feel different really, but im a disc onetrick
[0:32:59] drfeltgood: Healing is much easier but it turns SS into Damp/mana fest
[0:33:01] WeDizzy: Healing is difficult on the fact that newer people are actually truing to play which is good but makes it tough lower down
[0:33:03] DatShockDoh: warrior is the second most represented spec in 2s and 3rd in 3s.
[0:33:03] kjyddeig: disc priest is free rating now
[0:33:04] Bulletsky: @shad3dspectr3 i played it against warlocks. went 1-5
[0:33:05] bransby09: games just go to 50% damp and then it sucks

[1:29:19] wow_revan: @Pikabooirl You can guess a bot or AI bot (which are the new ones) by 2 things. They move left and right several times before moving in another direction. 2. Recitation and timing are from 0.2 milliseconds to 0.10 milliseconds. One cannot press one button that fast let alone 2.

[3:45:33] JaQosrs: What makes outlaw so tanky?
[3:46:03] ralvich: @jaqosrs I think it’s the cd reduction
[3:46:13] RealDane: i love watching htis
[3:46:15] RealDane: this
[3:46:16] nonstermob: this setup with assa looks insane though , bleed everything multi dog
