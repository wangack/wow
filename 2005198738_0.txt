[5:51:18] EngeltheFallen: howard seen shit though
[5:51:21] kodiak_vance: So what are the chances that a couple people dont take the bomb out of the raid?
[5:52:04] EngeltheFallen: the bomb should be good - they wipe it will be something they do not expect
[5:52:12] Euphiris: Cobalt has the benefit of being able to iceblock if someone doesnt leave the stack
[5:52:31] Euphiris: The scarier situation is if a mage iceblock when they get affected by living bomb
[5:52:35] nickdwolfwood: god this is making me itch for WoW, and Ive been clean for years!
[5:52:43] EngeltheFallen: yeah i nearly reinstalled

[5:53:38] duncanatx: why would you do the lava without rav?

[6:12:06] EngeltheFallen: no one stream will get a mass of viewers but between them all will be a crazy amount of people watching
[6:12:29] EngeltheFallen: everyone will be watching their fav streamer - and not like all on like soda
[6:12:33] Fanrogh: look out for the molten destroyers :P
[6:12:46] cheduranga: I bet soda hits at least 100k tho
[6:13:00] EngeltheFallen: not sure since a lot will also be on miz

[6:39:29] ComradeCurt: cobaltHi
[6:39:49] RoseSakurako: @ComradeCurt larsfestHi
[6:41:10] ComradeCurt: Is MC the end of only fangs?
[6:41:16] ComradeCurt: Oh nvm
[6:41:20] Lymezz: im really enjoying the late wow
[6:41:21] Euphiris: I dont think the guild will survive Christmas break tbh
[6:41:23] Euphiris: So its good timing
[6:41:26] skav_tv: whats your normall game??
[6:41:35] Lymezz: personally
[6:41:55] the_gringe: did u ever play noita? think i asked before
[6:41:59] SgtKeeneye: A few people have said lets go to all the way to Naxx but i dont see it happening @ComradeCurt
[6:42:03] RoseSakurako: @CobaltStreak lol, dude I don't mind at all I enjoy watching you play anything. as long you are having fun I'm cool with it and that's the most important thing
[6:42:23] ComradeCurt: Halls of torment current patch is very fun for me
[6:42:46] the_gringe: trust me explosion immunity makes you immune to giga nukes Kappa
[6:43:03] Shadewfire: Are all the raids out for hc or are the released one at a time like they originally did?
[6:43:10] Euphiris: KEKW
[6:43:17] Malfturbate: ayyy, good luck tomorrow, super hyped youâ€™re in the raid
[6:43:40] v8thunderbird: i had fish sticks just now
[6:43:44] Malfturbate: hell yeah
[6:43:45] RoseSakurako: nice nice
[6:44:21] Euphiris: Any consumables that you still need?
[6:44:35] RoseSakurako: I'm not quite informative about this game items and lore but I'm learning enough to keep up with you guys
[6:44:38] Euphiris: Elixer of Fort?
[6:45:31] RoseSakurako: lol
[6:46:19] Euphiris: Thats not a thing in classic
[6:46:22] Euphiris: Thats wrath+
[6:46:38] MrLostcause: seqDance
[6:46:49] RoseSakurako: @Euphiris is classic that different than hardcore?
[6:47:28] Nightbot: Use this link to buy anything from Amazon to support Cobaltstreak -> https://tinyurl.com/cobaltamazon
[6:48:52] StanLeeC: StanLeeC subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 67 months! gl on the raid tomorrow
[6:49:07] Euphiris: @RoseSakurako It tries to emulate vanilla so they cut stuff out
[6:49:21] Euphiris: @RoseSakurako Also hardcore is classic on this server
[6:49:58] Shadewfire: Is hc staying vanilla only?
[6:50:08] Euphiris: Its rogues
[6:50:15] Euphiris: Rogues die first
[6:50:53] RoseSakurako: @Euphiris I see, so you mean the mechanics are different too or just the items or how characters upgrades when it comes to that
[6:51:29] Euphiris: @RoseSakurako A lot of the progression and strategies are different
[6:51:56] Euphiris: BC cannot be HC. There are too many bosses that have close to guarenteed kill mechanics
[6:52:08] Euphiris: They would have to change some raids
[6:52:08] SnappyTwoPoint: gm chat cobaltHi
[6:52:24] gooeythorns: cobaltHi
[6:53:19] Euphiris: There's 2 fangsly in felwood. They might already know a few
[6:53:21] Euphiris: spots*
[6:53:22] Shadewfire: @Euphiris That's what I figured. Haven't done raiding since BC and this seems waaaay more intense LUL
[6:54:10] Euphiris: Hardcore really makes you have to appreciate all the items and advantages you can get. Like I played since vanilla beta and I dont think I ever used a petri until Hardcore
[6:54:52] Euphiris: They were there since the beginning
[6:55:07] Euphiris: But no one would want to spend 30 stonescale oil and all the other garbage to make them
[6:55:11] the_gringe: Sadge
[6:56:31] Shadewfire: Have any guilds already done MC or is OnlyFangs the first?
[6:56:56] Draleric: KEKW

[7:11:29] Draleric: Someones gonna pull aggro and shes gonna breath the raid NODDERS
[7:11:54] Euphiris: Extras so breaks can be taken during the raid
[7:11:57] Fryrus: are we gonna do a bet tomorrow over whether someone griefs the guild for content
[7:13:42] uwuphoria: why dont you have the pig cobalt? DansGame
[7:13:49] arktek_: hcjBuff1 hcjBuff2 hcjBuff3
[7:13:57] LordChefMage: I think there's a 0% chance someone griefs intentionally
[7:14:00] Euphiris: Soda is going fury/prot. Aggro shouldnt be an issue
[7:14:39] dolemiteo23: show me ur tits cobalt. show me them right now.

[7:54:41] Fluffymagicman: @jackjm I thought someone was just dropping the buff, not RUNNING zg
[7:54:43] uwuphoria: cobalt is acting like a guild leader still even tho he isnt one LUL

[8:01:35] Bioamp09: GFP is a must for rag, we'll see what happens
[8:01:49] Fluffymagicman: You really shouldn't be taking like any fire damage. I'd say living bomb but you can ice block it

[8:02:45] uwuphoria: @Bioamp09 2cst
[8:03:17] Fluffymagicman: @LordChefMage Umm.... Decent chance of Rav. Pretty good chance of Tectone. Will Neff is also a likely candidate
[8:03:56] Fozi_Bear: cobaltPeek

[8:05:04] LordChefMage: Can't believe Rav hit 60 in 3 days
[8:05:12] jackjm: time for an isaac run while you wait for miz LUL
[8:05:28] Fozi_Bear: there a stinky panda hiding?
[8:05:44] uwuphoria: he hasnt said nothing tonight but probably LUL
[8:05:50] Draleric: He has a Tainted Lazarus to Lamb waiting for him cobaltW
[8:05:57] EpicPumaNess: all night stream cobalt?

[8:09:33] Fluffymagicman: Yeah mind control brd buff before raid
[8:09:34] LordChefMage: Miz is MT on Rag?
[8:09:44] LordChefMage: God help you
[8:09:48] Fluffymagicman: @LordChefMage If he gets the required fire resist

[8:10:23] Fluffymagicman: See that quest marker like directly north of you? That's the guy
