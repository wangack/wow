[3:10:36] thorntwi: @Mohinder1992 Water boils at a hundred but the stove is much warmer than that, if you stay in a sauna that is 100C is would take many hours before it boils

[3:10:54] Seronem0: LMAO if your body temp goes above 41¬∞C youre dying. Being in a 90c or 105c sauna is not critical
[3:10:58] dukeofjuk3: the thermometers are placed at the top, its alot warmer just below the roof in saunas, thats why they have raised seats so you can choose your temp
[3:10:59] danteenus: 100 celsius KEKInsane u would evaporate
[3:11:00] skappster: nah a bunch of saunas go over 100 celcius

[3:11:06] Licoric3: 100celcius in the ceiling is not odd at all. 85-90 celius is regular sauna temperature in Scandinavia

[4:01:29] papamafs: playing a 10 year old game where everything is cleared week 1, is either for retards who isnt good enough to play retail or ppl who wanna compare dick sizes thrrough logs
[4:01:32] Cecross: @LightBladeStream I get your point, yeah
[4:01:33] Brelshar: well som,e people cant achieve anything in their real lives so they need parsing in  20year old game
[4:01:37] Fabzerxff: AlienPls3
[4:01:37] Tankersss: the df version yes
[4:01:44] Nesriel: @kalstrom no, cause parsing in classic is literally about getting ur d sucked by your group,killtimes and gear

[4:02:54] Brelshar: im playing melee hunter from level 12 and its already great
[4:02:55] Opipul: Problem with aprsin is that, if you dont even want to compete, you are forced by other people to do it so because they chceck parses/gs in game which require pressing 2 buttons as dps, and keeping only aggro as tank

[4:03:35] EspressoAddict2020: like jokerd in wotlolk Aware
[4:03:36] LightBladeStream: then dont try to get into sweaty raids

[4:03:41] joaogruas: @Opipul if it only required pressing 2 buttons everyone would have 99 parses lil bro you underestimate how bad some people are

[4:04:33] amoon101: so parsing is only problematic if you're bad?
[4:04:37] hauserdot: jokrdAnkha
[4:04:37] DuSkrald: just make your own group and dont ask for parses problem solved?
[4:04:38] mesmus9: nothing wrong with parsing, just dont force it on others
[4:04:38] itsBdaws: gear and log checks have become the BASELINE in pugs now it‚Äôs aids af

[4:04:52] lord_windir: COPIUM
[4:04:54] AllOfKingsPotato: peepoTalk parcing
[4:04:56] putt_aus: to have green parses you just need to have fingers and thumbs
[4:04:57] YourPegas: COPIUM
[4:04:58] irades: hello jokerd :)
[4:04:59] joaogruas: it's literally harder to get a grey parse than something like a 50 or whatever
[4:05:00] FrostsWorld: you're a bad player if you die to mechanics xD
[4:05:02] antmat88: @jokerdtv any chance of you leveling up a shadow priest? would love to see your game style with the current dps output SP has

[4:05:09] Armadicus: OFC Not, but most people who don't care about parses tend to be bad

[4:05:16] Nesriel: @joaogruas thats a u thing KEKW
[4:05:17] Dunkelz: eagles?
[4:05:18] Mystiggo: people who don't care about parsing and actually do mechanics enable parseheads
[4:05:18] GrovesyM: The problem isn't the sweaty guilds and players, speed runners etc. The problem is the normie guilds that jump on the bandwagon and it's cringe

[4:05:58] lovelovelotsoflove: Holy neverending parse yap
[4:06:00] nickylas: @Mystiggo most people who parse can do mechanics, most people with gray and blues fucking suck at mechanics so this is just copium
[4:06:00] putt_aus: yap

[4:06:18] mateszz1: What pet ability is the c-6 ?
[4:06:25] LightBladeStream: All of those arguments are bunk in SoD. Classes are 5 times more complex now than in Era Classic
[4:06:26] Skipiz852: The only problem I got with parsing and speedrun is usually its fucking expensive
[4:06:27] danteenus: i tried to get a good one time in bfd and got rank 2 overall KEKInsane
[4:06:29] Jacinho1: make your own raids
[4:06:29] Brelshar: easy fix would be to remove PI damage from parsing
[4:06:30] from4ge____: @mateszz1 bite
[4:06:31] Jacinho1: EZ
[4:06:36] hystelios: Hack the log website EZ
[4:06:36] Wullull: parsing in classic is also omega comp dependant, going into raid with wf + homonculi + cor is free 95+ parse on a warrior
[4:06:40] hauserdot: imagine being bad at anything

[4:06:54] LightBladeStream: Whats wrong with that?
[4:06:55] Mystiggo: @nickylas most people who want to parse will not run around clicking buttons on Thermaplugg

[4:07:42] tacoking011: it‚Äôs almost impossible to get in a pug as a warrior
[4:07:43] Rakschas: not on account of the skill of the players you invite, but on account of the parse that largely depend on the skill of the other people they raid with
[4:07:52] real_spin: most ppl are looking for 6/6 xp now
[4:07:54] Ystarinho: cicibank refused me to a raid caus i didn't have 99 parse
[4:07:57] bobiehd: 95% of the player base needs someone to hold their hand to clear the content
[4:07:59] nickylas: for me i've seen that iq and parsing goes hand in hand. people who are dumb cant parse tho

[4:08:31] hxzcc: yep, cant progress raids in retail becouse people care too much abut parsing
[4:08:34] Lawdie123: warrior parsing it, every warrior wants to pull at rocket speed unless they dont have a cooldown in which case they want everyone to wait.
[4:08:35] aty_13: I crit more therefor I'm more skilled ReallyNice
[4:08:39] saytan29: why dont suse aspect for movement
[4:08:40] Noxiirea: why complaining about people making 99parsers groupe and not tell to the gray parser to make their own groupe with grayparsers ??? this is called laziness somehow

[4:08:41] gdkpgold: yap go get broken tooth
[4:08:46] Blitzergman12345: I don't think people checking logs in order to try and recruit stronger performing players to clear content is a negative thing. If you got to a job interview and you're like yea this shit is easy give me the job and then you suck.. that's now how things work, lol.
[4:08:50] nickylas: @Mystiggo healers, all casters need mana. this has never been an issue??? ofc a mana class should press buttons

[4:09:01] real_spin: yeah but how are they not trying? are they just playing the class wrong ICANT
[4:09:02] Zyrax11: yap
[4:09:02] hxzcc: also people in retail purposly join raids to get higher parses meaning they are already locked out of the raid so they just make u lose loot, so degenerate

[4:12:09] Lothuz21: @LightBladeStream Best example of parsing brain I can think of right now is Morogrim from SSC from speedrunning guilds. Their entire goal is to be as fast as possible, but all warriors started spamming cleave during the murlocs, more dmg but slower kill.
[4:12:12] hot_souffle: TRASH LOGS -> BAD PLAYER

[4:12:43] kekD: there are literally 0 pugs on ur server that dont want good parses or?

[4:12:59] Rosabaum: you can also just do your own pugs
[4:13:01] LightBladeStream: @Lothuz21 padding is dumb but it doesnt matter if they crush the content anyways. A person who gray parses is probably not doing the mechanics either

[4:15:43] AllOfKingsPotato: PeepoNotes you are forked
[4:15:45] unohanaritta: the bank is a wrong comparison. The bank does not loan you money. They write a number on your account that you have earn and pay. Fractural reserve banking look it up. Banks are way more toxic than Pugs. You can compare a Pug to a recruitment process
[4:15:48] twistedopossum: OMG AGAIN WITH THE DOGSHIT FRIENDSHIP IN A MMO WTF THAT EVEN IIS

[4:16:23] Lothuz21: @hxzcc Very small amount of the people who parse in HC do it for parsing, atleast I think so.
[4:16:26] 1Head_KFC_MANAGER: you mean gatekeeping?
[4:16:26] twistedopossum: DANIEEEL JUST PUT LFG

That fateful day when you decided to test the strength of my bottle while I was innocently taking a sip. The incident might be insignificant to you, but it was a moment that shaped my perception of trust and friendship. I hope this message serves as a reminder that our actions, even from our younger days, can leave lasting imprints on others

They are always Good Armored with Strong Stamina Super Power and carry Epic Weapons and bows. To become best in the game with Melee Hunter you need to train continued atack with strong rotation to look for combination of Strengt and Agility. Super damage dealers against more mobs with traps and single target it all depends on your talents and rotation.
