[0:00:40] taxiidk: :b
[0:00:54] kellarXO: They fired all the WoW devs we're finally free boys game over FeelsStrongMan
[0:00:55] ciggyman: imfiredupBlessed
[0:01:30] Camalleri: for real what did happen?
[0:01:53] the_inhumanatee: I wonder how many devs who got fired went home and logged into wow to cope
[0:02:14] Lee_mes: most of the people fired weren't even devs tho
[0:02:15] the_inhumanatee: gotta suck to loose your job and your game :(
[0:02:21] Sover31gn: I mean layoffs after a merger are to be expected
[0:02:22] itsWaSu: 3
[0:03:01] ThreesFG: Love to any blizz homies that may be lurking
[0:03:14] OG_Kawngi: o7
[0:03:57] adelius3: @Sover31gn its not like they fired ABK marketing girlies bc MSFT marketing girlies already exist tho. They canceled survival game, they killed overwatch feature teams, etc.
[0:04:06] leubinator: who is oing to call asmon trash now that qwik is gone
[0:04:26] adelius3: @leubinator I volunteer
[0:04:34] MemphisGamingTTV: I blame Diablo
[0:04:48] Sover31gn: @adelius3 Yeah they cut stuff they disagreed on with previous management, so to say
[0:04:51] leubinator: d4 so bad they fired 1900 ppl
[0:05:17] daiger5o: maximumFEAR
[0:05:21] Sover31gn: There were also cuts in XBox team, probably because of the imported talent
[0:05:24] Ok_Kingston: this starting soon screen doesnt have enough in it
[0:05:44] OG_Kawngi: seems the survival game got cancelled because it had a ton of engine issues
[0:05:50] ArcaneSyntax: another day, another key in the #RetMeta
[0:06:15] gwenmh: legit sad about the survival game, the c-suite fucked them so hard making them swap engines
[0:06:34] malnourish_: sup nerd
[0:06:54] adelius3: @gwenmh I really wanted to play that game I am so sad
[0:07:50] turlionwa: @the_inhumanatee 1,900 Activision Blizzard and Xbox employees laid off
[0:08:01] basherbash32: Does anyone know why there is maintenance tomorrow?
[0:08:29] deviljin____: o7 to ppl who were let go, but it is what it is, either provide value for people to keep you around or get out
[0:08:33] ArcaneSyntax: i don't think anyone on the wow team was affected by the layoffs, so that's good
[0:08:40] gwenmh: a lot of the hearthstone dev team moved over to that project as well and most/all of them were canned
[0:08:56] Arkshol: who is the guy at the left bottom part of the screen?
[0:09:06] caprihornay: he's called
[0:09:10] caprihornay: ''The Brick''
[0:09:10] Antillarea: @Arkshol bricked up guy
[0:09:16] Arkshol: @Arkshol KEKW
[0:09:16] realGameTheory: ASSEMBLE
[0:09:17] leubinator: he doesn't know the brick
[0:09:19] danksly: thats bad they havnt got their head around the wow team yet monkaS

[0:11:07] leubinator: i need answers
[0:11:33] Joneim: Ja rule says layoffs are bad, more at 11
[0:11:40] oresties: Okay, something good to watch until the red wings game.

[0:11:48] Basic_3: Shit sucks sometimes.

[0:12:11] Joneim: No, Max usually runs 45 minute starting soon screens
[0:12:27] Joneim: To give you that waiting room before a dentist kind of vibe
[0:12:36] adelius3: fr omg its 15 minutes until my wife thinks I stop working and start being a dad
[0:12:42] Basic_3: Hits start, jumps in the shower. Classic Max.
[0:12:55] TheAbraxas94: @Joneim minimum Kappa
[0:13:38] Squats3: feels like a real odd day to start drops
[0:13:47] corruptedgg: Thd best of all
[0:13:52] freehawk1: YO microsoft KILLED blizzard HOLY SHIT!
[0:13:52] Squats3: were they on yesterday? i dont remember
[0:13:59] Joneim: Think we had drops yday, but the day is weird for sure
[0:14:09] haranoi: Kappa
[0:14:20] Squats3: dont think much of the wow team was hit by this.
[0:14:23] oresties: @Squats3 thought they started tuesday with patch
[0:14:31] adelius3: @freehawk1 saw a blue screen, and hit control alt delete?
[0:14:41] Squats3: @Squats3 might be correct. that makes sense.
[0:14:47] Joneim: @Squats3 A lot of GM's and stuff were let go, as well as some event designers
[0:14:52] punkekw: Did max end?
[0:15:03] exitiumDK: !drops
[0:15:05] Zarroe: he's barely started xdd
[0:15:42] Squats3: @Squats3 this has to be a lie blizzard hasnt had a GM with a pulse for over a decade.
[0:15:44] corruptedgg: Razer glasses on prom, 100% gamer
[0:16:12] Archmage_Michael: maybe someone else will take care of hunters now?
[0:16:27] Basic_3: lol
[0:16:30] Squats3: @Archmage_Michael shimmer?
[0:16:59] Basic_3: 2,000 people lose their jobs. Twitch response: "Buff muh class?"
[0:17:01] nicht_oli__: its just the beginning of the layoffs , 2024 will be brutal for the tech sector
[0:17:04] Basic_3: Classy as always
[0:17:20] Archmage_Michael: @Squats3 na, hunter barrier and 8 different def buttons would be enough
[0:17:42] Squats3: @Squats3 nah. thers a guy in my guild named shimmer and this was his exact response
[0:17:47] nezo_pont: It's HIM
[0:17:48] adelius3: hi

[0:18:40] realGameTheory: DogLookingSussyAndCute
[0:18:41] redgumbie: how old is he?
[0:18:42] ArcaneSyntax: eternal puppy
[0:18:43] zebracak35: Mike Ybarra said someone woul dhave to drag him out in order to leave blizzard and he just straight up quit. Something big must have happened
[0:18:45] conchelobe: my dog is 3 with mad puppy face
[0:18:52] Fatroids: @ProjectTurf i accidentally found his headphones on amazon. you don't want them.
[0:18:55] redgumbie: still puppy for sure
[0:19:02] Pyrrha_GG: thats puppy for sure
[0:19:09] MemphisGamingTTV: he looks like he is a good boy
[0:19:10] adelius3: word on the street is not that he quit
[0:19:14] ThreesFG: C suite gets to say they quit
[0:19:17] Sorin__: layoffs that big don't happen without a ceo being dismissed
[0:19:17] splashz0r: PR speech Chatting
[0:19:19] azurehq: Home feels safe again ? havnt been in stream for some time
[0:19:19] Squats3: basically yeah
[0:19:27] Joneim: Sounds about right yeah
[0:19:27] leubinator: he didn't have to leave but he couldn't stay
[0:19:27] Archmage_Michael: maybe he was one of the 1900 ?
[0:19:33] Joneim: This was a quote from Blizzcon
[0:19:35] turfjitsu: @ProjectTurf what are they.  I am just curious
[0:19:36] Cenergy: probably fought back, and got let go as welll
[0:19:37] Squats3: "do you want to be on the list or will you go peacefully?" kinda thing
[0:19:48] JansonLives: JansonLives subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 35 months! 
[0:19:51] zebracak35: no, i think MSFT made a decision he didnt agree with and left in protest
[0:19:53] VRVento: that’s how almost any high level executive firing goes
[0:20:05] Line_0: sad
[0:20:09] Scoops__: people in tech right now monkaW
[0:20:10] adelius3: well he posted a whole lot of text directly after it went public so he certainly had at least some notice
[0:20:10] Vigilnace: Hes friends with Phil spencer so I was kinda surprised
[0:20:11] splashz0r: @zebracak35 no shot lol
[0:20:15] Xulu_: My first instinct was that he chose to leave because he didn't agree with the lay offs.
[0:20:22] Zivs: when they were talking about how good friends they were with Phil and Mike at blizzcon Deadge
[0:20:24] YasminVibin: reptar did the impossible, he caught his tail :o
[0:20:25] adelius3: @Vigilnace ive heard the opposite. ive heard there is beef
[0:20:25] Archmage_Michael: Pretty sure he doesn't need to work anymore though. His severance will be massive
[0:20:26] realGameTheory: Sadge
[0:20:38] Joneim: Nah
[0:20:45] adelius3: I mean we do
[0:20:48] Line_0: he didnt know im pretty sure
[0:20:50] MemphisGamingTTV: No shot
[0:20:52] danksly: Corpa Corpa Corpa SCATTER
[0:20:54] ThisIzD: i mean hes a gamer.
[0:20:55] Line_0: felt like it came as a surprise
[0:20:57] Fatroids: @ProjectTurf Sennheiser HD 800 S
[0:21:05] Basic_3: The MSFT Game Director claims it wasn't a layoff, but maybe he's lying. Guy's name is literally "booty"
[0:21:05] CoffeeASAP: @Maximum I saw that nice person you helped with heroic amildrassil recently was actually a blizzard staff member and she was sadly apart of the impacted employees
[0:21:07] skewlbeta: In that corporate sphere they often aren't allowed to tell you anything until the day of, so even if he knew he'd go business as usual.
[0:21:07] Squats3: phil is the new bobby. fuck phil
[0:21:14] Joneim: You should invite him out to dinner and then ghost him
[0:21:16] Artheeri: didn't he also just randomly flame some pizza brand in ur chat, didn't elaborate further and left?
[0:21:19] ThisIzD: we love Mike
[0:21:29] leubinator: phil logged into d4 and started firing ppl on sight
[0:21:33] ArcaneSyntax: games reddit was shitting all over the guy
[0:21:35] Vigilnace: hes as gamer so we relate to him more I think
[0:21:35] Squats3: and mr booty. fuck that guy
[0:21:37] Archmage_Michael: was about to ask. what were his responsibilities?
[0:21:53] Celynae: I just got here, I missed something?
[0:21:54] adelius3: he's green hit him up :D
[0:21:55] reggiepowa: he was high rank in overwatch as well
[0:22:01] OG_Kawngi: they're naming a new Blizz president next week
[0:22:03] ThreesFG: One of us
[0:22:04] Line_0: wonder who blizzard will get now, probably no one as good
[0:22:06] nerefwow: He told Jason Schrier that he would have to be dragged out of blizzard. he definitely didn’t resign.
[0:22:09] adelius3: agreed with that
[0:22:12] JansonLives: I can't imagine how low the morale at that office is going to be for a while. With a new expansion coming seems like a great plan.
[0:22:17] Convection: His back to work policies drove away some of their oldest/best engineers
[0:22:24] Sorin__: I saw lichqueen saying she was affected by it
[0:22:32] reggiepowa: I guess he wasnt great for people who had to return to offices
[0:22:33] nicht_oli__: bobby kotick will be the new president Kappa
[0:22:37] OG_Kawngi: there was for sure tension after the meetings he had with return to office  and such
[0:22:40] cuck_norris__: kinda like when your dentist has fucked up teeth
[0:22:45] zebracak35: I litterally said that
[0:22:52] BigTrout3: Deja vu
[0:22:52] nealeyy87: he got a nice corporate golden parachute out
[0:23:10] MeisterChiefX: r/wow sure seemed to froth at the mouth to condemn him, that sub stays losing
[0:23:10] redgumbie: Next PoddyC guest
[0:23:14] BigTrout3: didn't we have this conversation not 2 minutes ago?
[0:23:21] 3V3R357: Belluar once made a youtube video talking mad shit about Qwik
[0:23:24] LionButLeon: Streaming
[0:23:27] highcard2: what was his title?
[0:23:35] Hipodilio: If you quit you dont get severance though right?
[0:23:36] zebracak35: I think ybarra's statement of "If you think executives are making a lot of money and you aren't, you're living in a myth" really pissed a lot of people off and thats why reddit hates him
[0:23:59] Reydien: he goes to blizzard after quitting microsoft
[0:23:59] nicht_oli__: @3V3R357 hes just desperate for hate views
[0:24:01] freehawk1: Microsoft KILLED Blizzard 😱 😱 😱
[0:24:05] Oracle_WoW: might find him working for microsoft soon
[0:24:08] Taiya: didnt he resign
[0:24:10] cataphract1014: inside agent, microsoft going to buy where ever he goes next
[0:24:10] OG_Kawngi: something definitely happened in the last few months
[0:24:11] skewlbeta: maybe his role was to see through the acquistion
[0:24:11] kellarXO: Maybe he escaped
[0:24:14] Cenergy: tin foil hat gang
[0:24:14] adelius3: my headcannon is that they talked to him about layoffs, he was uncooperative and obstinant, so now he is included
[0:24:17] Archmage_Michael: his position is prob obsolete or redundant
[0:24:17] ziptiedsmile: maybe theres bad blood between him and microsoft?
[0:24:25] mycho_: @MeisterChiefX r/wow fucking sucks, their main criticism for him was that he sold in-game boosts lol
[0:24:26] OG_Kawngi: no
[0:24:28] Reydien: not a big jump to assume a less-than-stellar opinion/relationship with Microsoft executives
[0:24:28] Pyrrha_GG: game devs and publishers seem big spooked
[0:24:41] zacance: did any of the wow team get laid off
[0:24:47] adelius3: my headcannon is that they talked to him about layoffs, he was uncooperative and obstinant, so now he is included
[0:24:47] Squats3: someone at his level would never get a severance package
[0:24:53] twinkieruler95: @Maximum what happend?
[0:24:54] Pyrrha_GG: @zacance most likely
[0:25:02] sigabr: @Maximum this kinda always happens on acquisitions...
[0:25:03] Squats3: hed get to keep his options and get the boot
[0:25:08] Archmage_Michael: @Squats3 you're 100% wrong
[0:25:09] Sorin__: they always make a show of bringing in new leadership when layoffs like this happen
[0:25:11] ThreesFG: Easy Goldie p
[0:25:26] PepikStep: what gets a company from A to B may not get them to C.
[0:25:33] reggiepowa: didnt stood by them for wfh lol
[0:25:35] ColdIceCreamMan: Apparently he said at Blizzcon that they have to "drag him out with force" and he's not gonna leave Blizz anytime soon
[0:25:35] TheBroCrow: Mike Ybarra may be a gamer, but he's a exec first
[0:25:36] starless0ne: high lvl execs could prob kill someone and still get their severance moneys StinkyCheese
[0:25:39] Convection: My head canon is that he was always on the block to get let go cause of his policies that angered some of the major players at the company and forced them to leave...
[0:25:41] Alkahzane: or he got fired to minimize the amount of management and make the org more flat
[0:25:41] noewon: GIGACHAD yep thats how it went down for sure
[0:25:47] highlordspaghetti: hes the blizzard Hodor
[0:25:53] Ok_Kingston: I like that story. Making shit up goes hard
[0:25:54] danksly: he threw his shoes in the servers ventilation
[0:25:55] nerefwow: o7 Mike
[0:26:06] Hermganksyou: PR tweets ResidentSleeper
[0:26:08] corruptedgg: Layoffs happens with every big acquisition tho
[0:26:15] ph33nxx: Riot seemingly had a really good severance package
[0:26:16] Zozohnet: as long as we are all guessing, i'm gonna go with the "man was exausted and just wanted a break" line
[0:26:16] scolian: Sign of recession with all these companies laying off staff left and right.
[0:26:24] moash_: Riot dodging the hate by timing it before Microsoft
[0:26:24] Chupicabruh: Correct
[0:26:26] nealeyy87: what happened is very normal with corporate mergers. company takes over, layoffs happen, old leadership steps down
[0:26:27] Sorin__: very generous yes
[0:26:30] nicht_oli__: mike ybarra left blizzard because he is going to join liquid Kappa
[0:26:34] jhopps12: microsoft did the same
[0:26:36] jesuslouise: layoff tier list Pog
[0:26:37] OG_Kawngi: the info for ABK is out there too
[0:26:37] the_inhumanatee: @Maximum I work at Citigroup, our severance package is one month pay per year service, full bennies, and 10k cash
[0:26:37] danksly: all the d4 horses and an arthas statue Pog
[0:26:39] TheBroCrow: no shot Blizz offers the same, they had staffing issues even before MS buyout
[0:26:40] ColdIceCreamMan: as if
[0:26:41] xrandomdoodx: pizza party
[0:26:41] ciggyman: a punch in the balls
[0:26:46] dizorid: a juice box and a high five
[0:26:47] MeisterChiefX: not in the slightest from what ive read
[0:26:47] Rellak: a swift kick in the ass, probably
[0:26:47] leubinator: 5 wow tokens per employee
[0:26:48] Jack_the_Dipper: Free copy of the new expansion
[0:26:49] adelius3: microsoft is usually 2 weeks per year of service up to a cap
[0:26:51] GumdropsTSM: Tragic that a tier list of layoffs is possible
[0:26:52] Rampo123: free blizzcon pass and a puppy
[0:26:53] Trodenskjold: Blizz is giving the fairy tmog set to everyone getting fired
[0:26:57] ThreesFG: Severance tier list is v cursed 2024 content
[0:27:01] zebracak35: @sigabr Yes and no. They cut all customer service, and whole entire game and almost all community managers, this was more than normal merger efficiency cut
[0:27:02] iWatchPeoplePlayStuff: fairlife chocy milk and a some traders tender
[0:27:05] Niktarpoo: what's happening at blizzard?
[0:27:06] Zozohnet: B-tier severance package
[0:27:07] Jack_the_Dipper: @leubinator LUL
[0:27:08] PepikStep: severance
[0:27:10] TheBroCrow: new youtube video Pog
[0:27:12] noewon: Blizzard is giving you a handshake and good luck as severance KEKW
[0:27:15] Vigilnace: Microsoft will cut out blizzcon too I bet
[0:27:19] nerefwow: a ride on Bobby’s $69b yacht.
[0:27:20] Hedto12: been so many layoffs in the industry since the start of theyear
[0:27:22] zebracak35: @Niktarpoo 1900 people lost their jobs today
[0:27:26] cataphract1014: its not really just gaming, my mom is pretty much being forced to retire
[0:27:26] Yidz: january is lay off month
[0:27:29] likeclokwerk: the layoffs are insane for so early in the year though
[0:27:34] ArcaneSyntax: @Maximum silver lining but the wow team seems completely unaffected.
[0:27:35] fzybny: Giga common with acquisitions
[0:27:35] Hedto12: pretty standard in big mergers
[0:27:43] the_inhumanatee: theres a HUUUUUUGE deficit after a merger that needs to be addressed
[0:27:45] AsilemxD: Who's responsible for all these layoffs
[0:27:45] GumdropsTSM: I would expect layoffs in supporting functions that have overlap - but there are lot of game production teams getting decimated
[0:27:47] nightst314: basically also every year prior to quarterly earnings
[0:27:48] Convection: Nah this normal for tech layoffs, even the time of year is normal
[0:27:48] corruptedgg: A lot of overlapping position's
[0:27:54] dizorid: 100%
[0:27:55] Sover31gn: Gaming had huge growth from covid and companies expanded too much since the growth stopped
[0:27:59] Convection: There's a ton of layoffs going on right now in tech, it's 100% normal
[0:28:00] bubblebbuutt: company’s over hired during the COVID boom. it’s not only due to MA
[0:28:02] danksly: something is cooked at blizzard lets hope bill 5ginyourveins gates can get to the bottom of it FeelsOkayMan
[0:28:04] ThisIzD: def not just that as well.
[0:28:08] zebracak35: Yes @Maximum , but this is more than that. THey cut the entire customer service department, and a game and community managers
[0:28:09] VRVento: it’s not just gaming @maximum those are just the ones we are hearing about
[0:28:09] periperus: they have evaluated it before finalizing the deal...
[0:28:12] Trodenskjold: @AsilemxD Some guy named Gary
[0:28:19] TitansGore: When Disney bought Fox, they fired 10,000 people
[0:28:21] Bret36: There's a ton of overlap within jobs also
[0:28:22] rexxantik: the message from microsoft seemed to be that they were basically gonna leave abk alone and let them do their thing
[0:28:22] Squats3: @bubblebbuutt phil literally said "we found areas of overlap"
[0:28:22] itsmiraix: WHAT! lol
[0:28:25] Hipodilio: You'd think that it wouldn't be the peons at the bottom
[0:28:25] TheAbraxas94: according to sources, yes
[0:28:26] zebracak35: Yes they are outsourcing it
[0:28:26] fatmadjokerog: is our boy scarizard avoid the layoff?
[0:28:29] Joneim: Yeah it seems like they are outsourcing it
[0:28:34] nerefwow: Aware
[0:28:35] Joneim: Thats the word on the streets
[0:28:35] Ok_Kingston: Seems fake I had tickets answered within an hour today
[0:28:35] Lenietwitch: wait what ??? holy shit D:
[0:28:35] Archmage_Michael: redundant dept like HR go first. you only need MS HR and not MS HR, Activision HR, Blizzard HR, then billing will be combined etc ...
[0:28:36] Alkahzane: customer support is getting outsourced
[0:28:37] Line_0: true
[0:28:42] Rampo123: good they were useless
[0:28:42] mycho_: @fatmadjokerog Yes, alot of the WoW teams seem to be safe.
[0:28:43] Artheeri: Aware outsourced to chatGPT
[0:28:51] Line_0: they will all be outsourced to a 3rd party now
[0:28:52] ArcaneSyntax: that might not be wow GMs, but a large amount of Blizzard CS
[0:28:53] SeanTKE: companies acquire so they can make profit off the products they usually cut r&d and other not direct profit components pretty quickly
[0:28:56] TheAbraxas94: @fatmadjokerog he said he dodged for now
[0:28:56] Line_0: is what sources say
[0:29:02] Alkahzane: outsourced to microsoft support staff lets goooo
[0:29:04] Squats3: @Maximum that sucks because their CS is already kinda..... not great.
[0:29:07] LionButLeon: yep
[0:29:08] Ferg_6: You used to be able to call them lol
[0:29:09] Yidz: way back in the day they were insane
[0:29:15] defund_pug: Its hilarious the same people saying rest in piss bobby etc are now crying about their jobs on twitter bet they wish he was here right now
[0:29:17] ArcaneSyntax: I had a wow GM give me a store mount once
[0:29:17] Sorin__: It's wild that they cancelled a full project
[0:29:24] ikMaxx: if it was outsourced its not bad right? Some Americans lost their job but a bunch of Indians got hired
[0:29:24] leubinator: back in wrath they did stupid puns at the end of the interaction KEKW
[0:29:25] VRVento: isn’t that all customer service
[0:29:28] ThisIzD: @defund_pug wut
[0:29:31] dustin_handsupdb: Anarchy Online used players as GMs, they started at low levels with low power (just simple unstuck and stuff like that) and then worked their way up as volunteers. Only staff was a small team to manage them.
[0:29:32] sigabr: @Maximum nope..
[0:29:33] Lethkar: GMs used to end their messages with “BY THE LIGHT OF ELUNE!!!” times changed…
[0:29:33] ThreesFG: We getting GM-chat-gpt
[0:29:34] mycho_: @defund_pug ????? Chatting
[0:29:36] RenegadeHeals: i have not had a single bad experience with cs in 10 years but i also dont need to bug them with my bs every month
[0:29:38] Slay4daysKappa: I was  banned once my appeal denied, sent it again other guy i guess check it and was like oh our b unbanned. @Maximum
[0:29:38] freehawk1: 1900 developers is 8% of their workforce.
[0:29:39] sigabr: @Maximum  notalways
[0:29:40] Squats3: a regular person already couldnt get a GM with a pulse. my tickets would just get auto closed or left there for days.
[0:29:43] sunchippss: cival war trending jfc
[0:29:44] notpadfoot: mostly cost. idk about quality
[0:29:47] LionButLeon: @defund_pug HUH
[0:29:48] eviljuju_eu: yes but maybe faster response
[0:29:48] yeyanow: the point is to save my.. most likely by providing worst quality
[0:29:51] OG_Kawngi: ???
[0:29:57] Joneim: HUH
[0:29:57] Jjmn12: genius spotted
[0:29:57] Line_0: too soon
[0:29:59] corruptedgg: Customer support is dying in every Industry, till AI take over
[0:30:00] pandoriic: what lmao
[0:30:01] Basic_3: We found it. The only Pro-Bobby person on the planet.
[0:30:03] ArcaneSyntax: Chatting
[0:30:03] TheAbraxas94: ddemon
[0:30:03] TheBroCrow: gigachatter
[0:30:04] TitansGore: The quality of GMs have been garbage for a while already
[0:30:06] maddershunt: have they out sourced to india ? always seems the cheaper option
[0:30:07] OG_Kawngi: brain damaged chatter, sad to see
[0:30:08] Liquidor: A lot of things today can be fixed with the Blizz website now though. We didn't have those features/services back in the day. So customer support would most likely be account related stuff?
[0:30:11] Joneim: Bobby definetly deserved the rest in piss calls
[0:30:12] pandoriic: truly Chatting
[0:30:15] nightst314: if the merger didn't go through and Bobby was still around we would have seen 3digit layoffs anyway
[0:30:18] ThreesFG: Robert was on the flight logs bro
[0:30:19] Genkar85: looks at vince mcmahon
[0:30:22] Sorin__: yeah if only he was still there threatening to kill his employees
[0:30:31] GunsEvisu: bobby was the king of layoffs
[0:30:37] CoffeeASAP: Poor CEOs :(
[0:30:40] Wikedlyrics: bobby defenders AINTNOWAY
[0:30:41] nightst314: Asmongold kinda turned into a Bobby defender
[0:30:42] TheBroCrow: CEO cope
[0:30:44] ciggyman: bobby on the burna
[0:30:46] Ok_Kingston: Bobby clearly was super dope
[0:30:47] the_inhumanatee: @Maximum if the games were good under him, would you feel differently?
[0:30:47] adelius3: ABK stockholders defended him he did alright for them
[0:30:48] goombacci: he is saying blizzard is blizzard, employees or management
[0:30:49] Archmage_Michael: layoffs often have a positive effects. the people staying will work harder to keep their jobs.
[0:30:49] defund_pug: No they acted like microsoft was the saving grace and not worse then bobby its funny at best
[0:30:50] TheAbraxas94: bobby would have doubled that
[0:30:50] Line_0: the landlord crowd LUL
[0:30:53] yeyanow: no CEO defenders here
[0:30:55] noewon: baseg bobby did nothing wrong
[0:30:56] nationas: he did his job, made a lot of money
[0:30:57] Jack_the_Dipper: Financially we maybe not get it
[0:30:57] Artheeri: there are no real bobby defenders, only contrarians
[0:31:01] OG_Kawngi: dark timeline where people are defending bobby
[0:31:02] PurpleKami: bobby defenders are contrarian addicts
[0:31:04] Trodenskjold: @nightst314 You mean Zackrawr?
[0:31:06] Squats3: bobby was the king of profit. that man turned around Activision and no one can deny that. he was, however, a big ol' bitch. @Maximum
[0:31:10] ColdIceCreamMan: @Archmage_Michael wrong and piss take
[0:31:16] Line_0: bobby wasnt even involved in the creation of the game though was he
[0:31:18] Myleod: i love how microsoft was like "you guys have been doing such a good job earning back respect from consumers we are going to reward you by gutting your teams"
[0:31:23] Line_0: his job was creating money
[0:31:23] SCxFaytal: @Squats3 ^
[0:31:27] Basic_3: I'm asking Driney about you right now.
[0:31:28] ikMaxx: @Maximum ppl don't stay on the millionaire side bro, I doubt he managed to be CEO for that long being the worst
[0:31:30] lonesomecowboy: not to comrade post on main but its almost like our economic system is designed to grind the working class into paste in order to furhter shareholder profits even the tiniest margin
[0:31:31] deviljin____: I don't know if theres anything ethically wrong about these layoffs like people make it seem like, it just sucks for them and it is what it is
[0:31:37] merzicdh: i just love how we analyze this kinda stuff like we have any knowledge of the inner workings/status of large companies.
[0:31:41] Jack_the_Dipper: Bobby is a verry good and smart businessman, but that's it
[0:32:01] likeclokwerk: people have to reconcile things they like being made under terrible conditions like every other day in the games industry
[0:32:17] nightst314: 2008 late
[0:32:19] reggiepowa: 2008
[0:32:20] AutomaticJak: 484 raiders from AutomaticJak have joined! 
[0:32:24] the_inhumanatee: @Maximum OW2, Shadowlands, early D4, Diablo Immortal

[0:32:40] Trodenskjold: @likeclokwerk I dont care how bad the conditions are as long as the game is good
[0:32:41] nightst314: The WoD fiasco forced Bobbies hand
[0:32:45] Amandalorian: o7
[0:32:53] nerefwow: o7
[0:32:58] danksly: nightbot involved in the coverup Corpa
[0:33:03] DakotaPelana: how does this affect wow? seems like it was on the up up
[0:33:05] CoffeeASAP: jakbCOOL
[0:33:05] Basic_3: This is exactly the WotC/Hasbro argument, despite that being some 1999 shit.
[0:33:13] Yagr6: how about as a company you take accountability and stop tryn to push blame onto one guy, sure he might be bad but yikes the mental gymnastics
[0:33:14] nicht_oli__: at the end of 2024 blizzard will have 1/3 of the current workforce , why pay people if ai can do a worse job for free Kappa
[0:33:23] Ok_Kingston: BOBBY KOTICK GAVE US M+ BOBBY WIN
[0:33:27] yeyanow: both can be bad chatter
[0:33:28] twinkieruler95: repeat them
[0:33:32] PuzzleMonkey: yeah but it would be cool if you did
[0:33:33] Yusaris: do it anyway yolo
[0:33:36] Sover31gn: Absolute goblin
[0:33:39] LionButLeon: @twinkieruler95 PogO no
[0:33:41] Edgy75: Is HOF filled yet chat?
[0:33:42] TirrinWoW: just google the donut machine incident
[0:33:49] Joneim: The ghostcrawler tweets about him were wild, it wasnt even bad stuff
[0:33:51] Zaisx: didn’t he tell one of his employees he was going to kill them? or something
[0:33:52] Trodenskjold: I like Bobby
[0:33:52] nezo_pont: GIGACHAD bobby
[0:33:59] danksly: i dont expect to see many fine fellas on that list
[0:34:01] OG_Kawngi: Bobby is looking for a new secretary. Google "Bobby Kotick Secretary" if you need more info to apply!
[0:34:04] leubinator: hell no
[0:34:06] jaynkumz: @Jack_the_Dipper it doesn't take a genius to fire employees and pay them less and get kids to play by casino tactics, this is the typical cancerous type of business of today same a Boeing, subscription everything etc
[0:34:16] Joriku: is mike staying in microsoft or blizzard or just leaving all?
[0:34:17] Trodenskjold: Top dps = insane gamer
[0:34:19] swan858: I think biggest shock is binning a game after 6 years development, especially a game genre blizzard are missing
[0:34:23] Basic_3: Holly seems like somebody who loves games but is super casual.
[0:34:25] Basic_3: As a comparison
[0:34:26] darksoldier2245: He got a bit shtick for not knowing who preach was
[0:34:27] chubbytheboi: Wasn't he one of the people that sexually abused colleagues or am I mistaken?
[0:34:28] AutomaticJak: 100%
[0:34:29] YayFiber: he plays the game and like it. that's sick
[0:34:29] CoffeeASAP: yup
[0:34:38] guynormally: Mike Ybarra is Qwik?! yooo wtf I love Mike even more
[0:34:39] punkekw: And what class he plays
[0:34:40] Sorin__: our ceo doesn't play any games, but he's literally just a money man
[0:34:43] KirbyDLX: He was not a very liked guy in the blizzard community with the RTO thing
[0:34:52] darksoldier2245: Warrior I think
[0:34:55] Wikedlyrics: @swan858 palword is on gamepass MS doesn't need another survival game on gamepass> coincidence?
[0:35:16] leubinator: every reddit thread across 3 subs was hardshitting on qwik today
[0:35:17] ocicatthedruid: He wasn't according to Microsoft
[0:35:23] leubinator: they hate the guy
[0:35:28] Basic_3: I think it's the latter
[0:35:28] YayFiber: didn't he work at microsoft before blizzard?
[0:35:33] Jaborba: Ybarra's hire came at a time where blizzard was in some controversies and his co-president stepped down he might've just been a temp hire while blizzard sorted their shit out
[0:35:36] GratefulRedd: He also worked at MS for like 20 years ircc
[0:35:38] Trodenskjold: @leubinator Reddit hates everyone
[0:35:38] NipeArcade: Bro got canned by Microsoft twice
[0:35:39] mycho_: Yeah he worked at microsoft for a while prior to blizzard
[0:35:41] dizorid: call him on discord
[0:35:46] Line_0: surprising
[0:35:56] Zaisx: I think Bloomberg reported he wasn’t laid off
[0:35:57] DakotaPelana: what are real humans?
[0:36:03] CoffeeASAP: reddit aggressively hated something? I'm shocked
[0:36:06] kellarXO: reddit is full of people who quit a decade ago and were casuals back then
[0:36:07] danksly: do you get to be ceo by having fist fights with shareholders
[0:36:07] ocicatthedruid: Matt Booty from MS said the Ybarra and Adham weren't part of the layoffs
[0:36:08] reggiepowa: he made ppl go back to offices, that wasnt very much liked
[0:36:10] PurpleKami: redditors blindly hating something they know nothing about is a classic
[0:36:11] SeanBad_: @swan858 difference is a 1PP would never leave the XGP service, Palworld probably won't be on forever
[0:36:12] surpriseparty20: Reddit people hate their guts ofc they gonna hate on Ybara LUL
[0:36:14] guynormally: GIGACHAD
[0:36:15] ciggyman: yes
[0:36:16] Basic_3: There's a Wowhead post with a quote from Matt Booty
[0:36:17] rexxantik: yes
[0:36:17] Line_0: KEKW yes
[0:36:18] realGameTheory: FeelsStrongMan Clap
[0:36:19] CoffeeASAP: lol
[0:36:22] Faraday5001: they hate him cos they "blame him for so much boosting" in WoW... its so funny
[0:36:22] the_inhumanatee: hes the literal Emperor of Mankind from 40k
[0:36:24] LionButLeon: YEP
[0:36:24] nerefwow: GIGACHAD
[0:36:24] mi_dude: yes
[0:36:25] ciggyman: he swapped def stance
[0:36:26] leubinator: booty hehehe
[0:36:26] pickle_jammies: usually those forced quitting situations include an nda.
[0:36:30] Balgar47: THIS.... IS .... BLIZZARD
[0:36:32] Yusaris: no
[0:36:33] Archmage_Michael: Scarface style
[0:36:35] noewon: GIGACHAD true , i saw it happen
[0:36:36] CoffeeASAP: they tore off his nads and kicked him out the door
[0:36:37] OG_Kawngi: you know the meme of the soldier taking the knives in the back while the person sleeps? that's ybarra now o7
[0:36:41] mi_dude: could tank it no longer
[0:36:42] LionButLeon: xddShrug worth a try
[0:36:42] SmellBadChad: qwik is literally gandolf fighting off the balrog
[0:36:42] ciggyman: i was there, i was the door
[0:36:45] TheAbraxas94: spill the tea YEP
[0:36:45] dizorid: call him, we want the drama
[0:36:46] TirrinWoW: thats the actual truth with brian birmingham the classic lead guy
[0:36:47] Archmage_Michael: have him come on stream
[0:36:48] guynormally: That would be a LEGENDARY poddy C
[0:36:49] kellarXO: hope on discord
[0:36:55] bowjangle: @maximum isn't mike ex Microsoft and had a falling out with them before changing jobs?
[0:37:01] Antillarea: poddy c poddy c
[0:37:10] MrFreezy16: Get him on poddy c easy
[0:37:20] surpriseparty20: Maybe he didn't want to be a part of the layoffs like he was when they forced the workforce back to the offices
[0:37:32] Nuteeno: from a friend who wasn't laid off, ybarra leaving was a surprise, adham was not
[0:37:36] brunbanan: 06:33 AM, he couldnt sleep
[0:37:43] bowjangle: If he is ex Microsoft then it makes sense
[0:37:50] Akeazxx: Was ybarra the good guy or the guy running it to the ground? im out of the loop
[0:37:57] Convection: It wasn't
[0:37:59] lathander557: "It was great to be part of the team that built Blizzard and ATVI over the years. I've decided to transition out now that it's merging with MSFT, and happy to have helped that succeed. I'll be taking time out for a bit to spend time with family and travel the world. Afterwards, will look for hyper-growth opportunities with great teams."
[0:38:04] Trodenskjold: @Akeazxx good guy
[0:38:04] Squats3: they were really big mad about going back to the office
[0:38:05] lathander557: He said "I've decided" to transition
[0:38:05] Convection: Ybarra was the one pushing office work
[0:38:08] menzlo: He quit right
[0:38:11] Caszatic: @Maximum do you think the increase populatrity for AI generated content/games, is impending doom for more upcoming layoffs?
[0:38:21] bowjangle: I heard he didn't like Microsoft at all
[0:38:27] goombacci: bill gates just hates dragonflight ig
[0:38:28] Tyfon7: i thought he left MS the first time because he wasn't gonna get Phil's job
[0:38:33] Line_0: the timing is kind of awkward unless its somehow connected to the layoffs
[0:38:42] noewon: He made game pass alone with his bare hands  GIGACHAD
[0:38:43] ocicatthedruid: Allen Adham
[0:38:46] Zaisx: In a note to staff, Microsoft Studios President Matt Booty said that Ybarra “has decided to leave the company.” At the BlizzCon convention in November, Ybarra said in an interview that he wanted to stay at the company for the long haul. “Someone will drag me out of Blizzard,” he said. “That’s how long I will be here.”
[0:38:48] oresties: founder?
[0:38:49] OG_Kawngi: co founder of blizz
[0:38:50] ocicatthedruid: Co founder of Blizzard
[0:38:51] Vigilnace: Adham is one of the orginal founders lol
[0:38:51] Yusaris: adham is the soulless mobile games guy
[0:38:53] rexxantik: chief design officer
[0:38:54] Antillarea: founder
[0:38:54] Basic_3: Co-founder of Blizz
[0:38:54] kibaha: what's Mike's main on wow? :D
[0:38:57] acekongtv: hes the mobile gaming guy
[0:38:57] Squats3: @Maximum i heard mike was actually really good friends with bobby and was enraged that he wasnt going to stay. so he left with him
[0:39:06] WowGrandma78: Allen Adhem  graphics design  was let go too
[0:39:07] Trodenskjold: @kibaha Jpc
[0:39:09] LionButLeon: xddShrug
[0:39:09] ocicatthedruid: never heard of that guy's name...smh
[0:39:12] lathander557: He left in 04 and came back in '16
[0:39:14] quai_gg: Bill Gates is coming out of retirement to become lead dev for World of Warcraft, big billy g
[0:39:15] Ok_Kingston: Guys name is Matt BOOTY
[0:39:25] WowGrandma78: i may have spelled last night  wrong
[0:39:25] tomdotdll: @Squats3 nice rumour spreading OMEGALUL
[0:39:25] Line_0: hard to imagine he would decide to leave voluntarily not in connection to any of it on the exact day that layoffs happen
[0:39:26] Trodenskjold: @Ok_Kingston Mad Booty, what a name
[0:39:27] magicman133: and you call yourself a true blizzard fan?
[0:39:34] WowGrandma78: but he was head of graphics  and something
[0:39:35] Caszatic: @Maximum do you think the increase populatrity for AI generated content/games, is impending doom for more upcoming layoffs?
[0:39:39] wuyubohehe: MS just wants to clear the house
[0:39:59] Squats3: @Squats3 its a joke. jeez
[0:40:00] bowjangle: I believe he'd want to stay with blizzard - but if he ready had a falling out with Microsoft it kinda makes sense imo 😬
[0:40:01] Caszatic: Palworld?
[0:40:04] Wikedlyrics: palword PepeLaugh
[0:40:04] nKoalaBear: its not a thing at all lmao
[0:40:04] MeisterChiefX: no lmao
[0:40:05] Trodenskjold: Palworld
[0:40:06] Dodgerx: palword mons were ai
[0:40:06] Yusaris: palworld is ai generated
[0:40:08] Faraday5001: palworld is causing this convo
[0:40:09] maddershunt: palworld
[0:40:10] ArchausDEKAY: What games have been AI generated?
[0:40:13] Reydien: Palworld isn't AI-generated
[0:40:14] nKoalaBear: palworld is not ai generated
[0:40:16] Squats3: we dont know if palworld is ai generated. just people saying it was. no one knows
[0:40:16] SeanBad_: palworld is not AI generated
[0:40:16] MadShadY: @maximum Does thd has currently mod
[0:40:17] Line_0: palworld isnt proven at all but people keep saying it is lol
[0:40:20] kellarXO: They're definitely replacing their GMs and Support departments with "AI"
[0:40:21] ColdIceCreamMan: palworld is not ai
[0:40:22] rozlotte: AI is still nowhere near making games without a lot of human guidance
[0:40:24] darksoldier2245: Don't start
[0:40:25] tomdotdll: @Squats3 classic of course it is
[0:40:26] Faraday5001: on god
[0:40:26] nKoalaBear: its literally not ai you guys are easily tricked
[0:40:29] BigSatchel: People just take it and run with it
[0:40:31] Ethuci: Palworld is no AI it was made up
[0:40:31] Boreall: I'm tired of the word Palword
[0:40:34] Boreall: The game is a passing fad lol
[0:40:36] Line_0: literally know one even knows if ai is involved in the first place
[0:40:37] SeanBad_: I can't believe people are still running with saying it was AI
[0:40:46] patofazquack: ai only helped on pal design on palworld
[0:40:48] whiskeyhide: for sure
[0:40:48] ArchausDEKAY: ofc
[0:40:49] wobblegoat: yes
[0:40:49] nKoalaBear: probably
[0:40:54] Jack_the_Dipper: There iis zero proof that the game is AII generated. Even te person that game up with the  rumour tweeted he made it up
[0:41:01] Elindalyne: this has nothing to do with AI... Layoffs were due to the covid gaming bubble + redundancies from the merger
[0:41:02] kellarXO: Support department diff
[0:41:03] skewlbeta: that's been the case for decades though.
[0:41:03] Sorin__: the question is which jobs will be replaced, and currently it's the wrong ones
[0:41:05] MrChaCho: Palworld isn't AI generated. The "same models" thread admitted to manually scaling models to make their argument work.
[0:41:07] Zaisx: AI twitch streamers
[0:41:09] theoddvan: bill gates' son is an affliction main that's my head cannon
[0:41:10] LeoricDidNothingWrong: Will we have AI Max in 10 years tho?

[0:41:21] Wikedlyrics: Chatting let me tell you my twitter theory
[0:41:23] BigTrout3: blizzard has used AI to help re-rig helmets on models in WoW
[0:41:23] mantooth11: just wait for the AI streamers
[0:41:25] Squats3: @Maximum idk how that works for growth. companies need people to work so they can afford their shit. if they replace a ton of low level jobs with ai then... less ppl to buy shit

[0:41:44] Trodenskjold: Max
[0:41:45] Caszatic: Yep
[0:41:45] lathander557: AI is basically like the next step in internet evolution. It's changing the way we get our information but can't wholly substitute everything
[0:41:46] D_Mo_Trae: already is one
[0:41:46] Horisafit87: YEP
[0:41:46] CoffeeASAP: RoboMax is welcome
[0:41:47] iMeista: how do you know you arent a robot
[0:41:50] magicman133: AI is too smart to do your job
[0:41:53] figtreejenkins: I thought Max *was* a robot.
[0:41:55] kellarXO: @Maximum If all these jobs are getting replaced with AI whos gonna be paying for these products when noone works
[0:41:55] Ok_Kingston: I'm watching an AI Limit Maximum stream now
[0:41:55] ExCodix: or "it"
[0:41:55] highcard2: itll be great for you max, we'll all be unemployed and have more time to watch your stream!

[0:42:05] ocicatthedruid: Neuro Sama
[0:42:06] ShaggySummers: robomax actually does sim-dps @Maximum
[0:42:06] Sorin__: do you?
[0:42:07] itsmiraix: How do we know that you arent Robomax already?
[0:42:08] Boreall: You don't have free will
[0:42:08] Yidz: u just think u do Aware
[0:42:11] Ok_Kingston: Cardboard cutout stream when????
[0:42:11] dubbyatt: robo max would absolutely deck you

[0:42:34] Caszatic: Bobby kotick got a 400 mil severence
[0:42:35] mi_dude: cut out robomax
[0:42:36] ColdIceCreamMan: it's not even "AI" it's the next step in automation. it's largely simple machine learning models. stuff is so blown up
[0:42:38] likeclokwerk: do you dream of electric sheep
[0:42:40] ciggyman: Susge
[0:42:45] BigSatchel: I love that show

[0:43:08] DanKnee16: get the tier list maker out
[0:43:10] Tyfon7: CNET
[0:43:10] danksly: you are robomax this reality is your load screen
[0:43:10] Ok_Kingston: IGN is where I get my n64 and ps2 cheat codes
[0:43:12] kellarXO: They're still popular with the "normies"
[0:43:14] danksly: pass the bong
[0:43:19] TheAbraxas94: @gwyndyllyn KEKW poor rod
[0:43:20] 1_7_4: playboy
[0:43:21] Wikedlyrics: its a meme to hate ign, their reviews are shit but news reporting is fine
[0:43:29] nezo_pont: When you accidentally open their site you watch 15 of their videos too xdd
[0:43:42] Elindalyne: riot had very good severance... i don't think anything was reported for the ms ones
[0:43:42] Boreall: @Maximum What do you think about theory that Ybarra was let go because of the name of the Survival game, Stunseed? Apparently saying it backwards was offensive
[0:43:44] notpadfoot: flashbang D:
[0:43:54] Dumogin: I definitely agree IGN has some good reporting about industry stuff.
[0:44:06] leubinator: xdd
[0:44:22] LionButLeon: one guy xdd
[0:44:23] d0mezg4mer: naw microsoft didn't report it
[0:44:23] Trodenskjold: @Boreall This is 100% true, its not a theory
[0:44:27] Convection: No one here would ever lie :P
[0:44:29] flabstv: one guyed for 15 minutes
[0:44:30] draconisraccoonis: you got one guy'd
[0:44:32] d0mezg4mer: there's no "winning" a layoff either
[0:44:32] oneifbyland: lying on the internet GIGACHAD
[0:44:36] Standy94: My jobs severance is a handshake on the way out
[0:44:55] itsbiggerfish: riot was also a bit of a "yeah this sucks but look how nice we are" PR angle
[0:44:57] relimee0: @Boreall YEP real
[0:45:02] limeoflight: @Standy94 handshake below the waist?
[0:45:07] Ahrmanhamma: Unfortunately most severance benefits are terrible, COBRA insurance is garbage for the vast majority. Career Assistance is pretty hit or miss. The 6month sallary is industry standard, but still nice
[0:45:18] KaladinHS: Microsoft has always given good severance
[0:45:19] Standy94: @limeoflight I wish
[0:45:20] magicman133: how much did riot give?
[0:45:31] limeoflight: @Standy94 unlucky
[0:45:36] WingedChipmunk: @itsbiggerfish i mean even if it's a PR angle, this is one of the BEST severances i've ever seen or heard of
[0:45:39] Thdlock: overwatch and d4
[0:45:39] Faraday5001: the survival game got nuked
[0:45:40] Line_0: everyone on the survival game team
[0:45:41] Wikedlyrics: the entire survival game dev team got laid off
[0:45:42] bergy101: D4, OW, Survival game, CS, some other niche stuff
[0:45:43] notpadfoot: WoW team is untouched
[0:45:43] starbittz: some wow devs definitely did
[0:45:44] TheGearman: Wow went relatively unscathed
[0:45:44] ph33nxx: Tech severance average is 3mo  pay, 3-6mo COBRA coverage.  Equity payouts vary by company
[0:45:44] Joneim: Some Event designers on wow as well
[0:45:45] SaraDivine: i saw a community manager for fallout 76 got laid off
[0:45:46] SparkledMoon: Survival for completely fired

[0:45:55] Defyin: seems like a lot of the survival game people
[0:45:55] Trodenskjold: I bet a guy named Robert was laid off

[0:45:56] Hedto12: some SFD got laid off
[0:45:58] wuyubohehe: no way they touch the wow team
[0:45:59] freehawk1: yeah fuck the people who got laid off I just wanna play WoW
[0:46:00] kellarXO: Classic WoW lead dev said his wow got laid off and bunch of others @Maximum
[0:46:01] WingedChipmunk: even people ive spoken with that have seen things like this said this was insane
[0:46:02] custom025: Blizz lost at least one CM. Left the community discord
[0:46:05] Tyfon7: In the past MS severance is 2 months + 1 month per year of employment
[0:46:06] ThisIzD: some D4 people and shitload of overwatch
[0:46:08] Mazkon: @WingedChipmunk just look up some exec severances, this shit is nothing comapred to those xdd
[0:46:09] limeoflight: Typically in company takeovers its customer support staff and management since microsoft already has those roles they can roll in
[0:46:10] zachl_: did newsh get laid off ?
[0:46:13] itsbiggerfish: 6 years in production xdd
[0:46:15] Elindalyne: it was mostly community management,  HR, support staff, sales due to merger redundancies...
[0:46:17] bergy101: OW2 and D4
[0:46:18] sp881: I thought it was in production for 6 years already
[0:46:18] SeanBad_: i dont think the full survival team got laid off, i think some are shifting to different projects
[0:46:18] Line_0: 6 years in

[0:46:35] Gamerhcp: bethesda but its owned by microsoft
[0:46:36] TheAbraxas94: bethesda - Microsoft
[0:46:36] OG_Kawngi: the survival game was 6 years in, and still 'many years away'. It had a lot of engine issues
[0:46:37] nezo_pont: It's Bethesda, still Microsoft tho
[0:46:37] WingedChipmunk: those are execs @Mazkon these are regular workers.
[0:46:37] yaboiamsung: bethesda is still under microsoft

[0:46:43] blacklight_____: it’s Bethesda which is under MS
[0:46:43] mattyzees: the layoffs are all over Microsoft Gaming not just ABK
[0:46:47] nightst314: @Maximum Chris Kaleiki mentioned that the survival game had years of development hell.
[0:46:48] Zaisx: the layoffs were in Microsoft game studios not just activision
[0:46:50] TirrinWoW: the 1900 layoffs are microsoft gaming wide not just atvi
[0:46:53] limeoflight: cant wait for microsoft to own me Kreygasm
[0:46:53] ColdIceCreamMan: overwatch and hearthstone are on life support. the planned hots revival is canned.
[0:46:54] Standy94: All the D4 devs that got laid off got to keep their level 45 accounts
[0:46:57] thylalol: @Maximum overwatch environment artists/tech, survival game team, cs and some classic for ABK.
[0:46:59] rozlotte: I work for bethesda. We were not affected at all
[0:46:59] Mazkon: @WingedChipmunk True, but still there are much better severances :P
[0:46:59] tow996: lets just hope that blizzard doesnt end up like skype
[0:47:00] Sover31gn: Are people from survival game laid off, or are they restructured?
[0:47:03] Mastodonian: It'd MS

[0:47:24] Tiizor: at least 2
[0:47:25] acekongtv: like 20 at least
[0:47:26] flabstv: everyone at bethesda should be fired for making starfield
[0:47:27] nightst314: Not anymore
[0:47:35] pandoriic: steam Community page shows current players (through steam at least)
[0:47:36] iFaTaLCeLL: It is fun
[0:47:37] Reluctors: OW2 actually has a bigger population than most think
[0:47:38] ColdIceCreamMan: it's no that bad but it was so much better
[0:47:38] ewevix: its on steam
[0:47:38] saladbar19: the pve
[0:47:38] WingedChipmunk: @Mazkon not justifying exec's but compare to any other company, this is incredibly good severance for your average worker
[0:47:40] Jack_the_Dipper: Well on Steam but you will only see Steam numbers
[0:47:40] leubinator: i saw a report that ow2 is actually kinda succsessful
[0:47:48] poklepkin: it is fun, and a good game
[0:47:49] Elindalyne: its doing well for people that are still playing it
[0:47:50] nuka73: OMEGALUL
[0:47:51] highcard2: all of the worst ppl i know irl like overwatch, just an observation
[0:47:51] LionButLeon: xdd
[0:47:54] Thdlock: i mean ow is fun
[0:47:59] Thdlock: but just kinda the same for years
[0:48:01] Osterberg501: Ow2 is still incredibly popular, people just making stuff up.
[0:48:02] bibendumcorran: bibendumcorran subscribed with Prime. 
[0:48:03] Wikedlyrics: @flabstv you say this but starfield was one of the few projects that has actually made MS money OMEGALUL
[0:48:03] Thdlock: it was fun in 2016 but idk
[0:48:04] iiamBaro: its fun but the its insane how you have to put 10 hrs or more to unlock an agent that is meta.. or pay 20bucks every season
[0:48:05] faithis: !drops
[0:48:06] Convection: OW2 is cause Kotick wanted boxes on shelves
[0:48:09] lexxii44: max - darkreader just changed my life THANK YOU
[0:48:11] faithis: !drop
[0:48:11] MeisterChiefX: its monetization is also a slap in the face to older players
[0:48:13] Artheeri: doomfist still exists, also problematic when you have a quirky melee wizard in a shooter xdd
[0:48:15] deviljin____: Hearthstone is probably still the most played Blizzard game right now, Mobile is a whole dif beast
[0:48:16] Standy94: This mute THD redeem is a bait
[0:48:16] bergy101: reddit (dot) com/r/Overwatch/comments/19fk2hk/multiple_people_at_team_4_just_got_hit_by_the/
[0:48:16] saladbar19: the worst part is they knew a year before they werent gonna do pve but waited to announce it
[0:48:17] magicman133: the pve is a massive bait. no one plays that shit
[0:48:17] flabstv: @flabstv it still shit tho :D
[0:48:17] tow996: 15k on steam, so less than age of empires 2 xdd
[0:48:18] nightst314: @Maximum Any remaining PvE plans for OW2 got axed today. Like even the Battle-Pass Storyy missions
[0:48:19] Belefint: the only reason i wanted OW2 was for the PVE :(
[0:48:19] Trodenskjold: @Thdlock You've had some horrible takes over the years, but this gotta be the worst
[0:48:29] Ojomon_: people internally said it was an activision situation. told them they had to make a 2
[0:48:29] Mazkon: @WingedChipmunk Oh that's beyond true, my fiancee got laid off a bit ago and she only got 4 months as a dev and nothing else
[0:48:33] Elindalyne: its the worst reviewed game on steam but consisently in the top 10 for revenue
[0:48:35] freehawk1: @Thdlock if you don't know why talk?

[0:48:58] Joneim: Drama WICKED
[0:49:01] yeyanow: unhinged people takes?
[0:49:01] magicman133: @Thdlock keep talking GIGACHAD
[0:49:05] SaraDivine: i would be curious on how many people were specifically acti/blizz. that seems like the more popular topic but that's why i mentioned a cm in 76 because it was broad

[0:55:17] hi_jopy: ye, i skipped S1 and had a blast with S2, but S3 is kinda meh, seems like skipping a season is the way to go :D
[0:55:17] Artheeri: all the laid off ppl from different companies should just open their own studio now 4Head
[0:55:27] LionButLeon: @Artheeri 5Head holy
[0:55:35] MightyBone_Yumuros: Frostgiant is hiring @Artheeri LUL
[0:55:44] east_8: yeah, that's not a good look
[0:55:44] Squats3: i still think the build diversity is just not good in the game. the talent tree isnt doing the game any favors.
[0:55:51] Only_Autumn: D3 was like that as well, the first few seasons were super rocky until it settled into a pattern
[0:55:53] Cdizzyb: go start a company to rival blizz called firestorm SeemsGood
[0:55:56] LionButLeon: yep
[0:55:57] ThisIzD: Datmodz quit doing the seasonal stuff and is just grinding normal d4
[0:56:00] LionButLeon: D3 GIGACHAD
[0:56:01] deebschmeeb: *IS worse than D3
[0:56:04] mycho_: Balance is pretty good in season 3 atleast
[0:56:04] PuppyTheDestroyer: 100%
[0:56:06] likeclokwerk: lets all go back to d3. who wants to run some GRs
[0:56:10] tatertotpauls: true
[0:56:15] Sorin__: oh yeah d3 originally was a catastrophe
[0:56:18] PuppyTheDestroyer: D3 is still insanely fun
[0:56:18] thefuntown: its the wow borrowed power expansion effect
[0:56:18] YayFiber: D4: Reaper of Souls will be great
[0:56:20] Yagr6: said that in season 1 said that in season 2 and saying it in season 3
[0:56:22] nerefwow: Reaper of Souls saved D3
[0:56:23] JakobLowrizzle: d3>d4 for sure. s30 is way more fun
[0:56:24] fzybny: So far, it just seems like the even D4 team > odd D4 team.  0/2 giga fun, 1/3 horrible.
[0:56:25] PJs_Banana: does d4 have map overlay yet? lol
[0:56:26] BiBaButzeBenne: reaper of souls really pushed it to a fun game
[0:56:36] poklepkin: @SookiePark o7 been there a year ago. stressful times, but we overcome it. stay strong and let yourself chill and recharge for a good few weeks
[0:56:37] Joneim: That'd be horseshit
[0:56:44] Defyin: uh poe 2 is almost completely new it seems
[0:56:45] naro1089: D3 got better with expansion
[0:56:49] acekongtv: that is a REALLY bad way to think IMO they didn't learn what was fun about D3 they made a skeleton game with terrible balance and bad mechanics and we need to give it 10 years to be good ? lol
[0:56:49] aft3rbu12n: poe2 is a completely new game though
[0:56:49] schiavetto: what's peewee?
[0:56:50] Joneim: @Defyin Not at all
[0:56:51] ikMaxx: @Maximum would you say the same about riot MMO in comparisson to wow?
[0:56:54] SolarSailFTL: @Maximum The nail in the coffin for me is even optimistic diablo people like wudijo and raxx are absolutely ragging on it. Obviously they have different viewpoints from average players tho.
[0:56:59] tatertotpauls: max would you try palworld or enshrouded?
[0:57:04] miceinmyveins: p o wee
[0:57:04] Virridian: PoE is going to be better than PoE2 for a while
[0:57:13] DunzoCD: it already seems like poe1 will be more fun than poe2 at least at the start
[0:57:13] Zaisx: D4 just needs an endgame
[0:57:21] baldrmac1: Destiny 2 KEKW
[0:57:24] tow996: i hope titan quest 2 is good Prayge

[0:57:38] brunbanan: hes so smart
[0:57:38] thegreatdestroyer27607: they need a PTR
[0:57:44] Reydien: @Defyin the closer we get to POE2 launch, the clearer it gets that "whole new game" was marketing fluff
[0:57:46] dubbyatt: woodland joseph
[0:57:48] draconisraccoonis: Woody Joe
[0:57:51] dragonxzz: raxx is not optimistic diablo people lol
[0:57:57] enigmasvea: wudi agrees the s3 theme is hella lame LUL
[0:58:03] mycho_: YEP
[0:58:03] Defyin: @Defyin new endgame, every ascendacy is brand new, new gem system, entirely new passive tree, every base type is new. please don't talk if you didn't actually watch the past exilecon where they explicity stated its a completely new game now
[0:58:06] SolarSailFTL: ARPG player template
[0:58:09] Candyfriend: even kinda in appearance
[0:58:13] Trodenskjold: Good ol Woody Joe
[0:58:19] brunbanan: in a good way?
[0:58:23] theoddvan: that almost sounds offensive LUL
[0:58:29] Squats3: @Maximum i would like to know why they made the camera in the malphas fight so god awful. it ruins the fight

[0:59:05] Nuteeno: ben has a broken fear receptor in his brain?
[0:59:13] BigTrout3: nut
[0:59:15] MedicineMan: As a person that was impacted by these Game layoffs this month. it really sucks. Every other company is laying off people, and we feel lost atm.

[1:00:37] MrAxeffect: HAHA thats the point
[1:00:46] MrAxeffect: they can offer lower pay
[1:00:50] SolarSailFTL: Oversupply of personel
[1:00:58] gammerinno: Wonder if Ben could beat me in ping pong tho? unlikely
[1:00:59] cactuar7: i work in a niche career involved with oil/gas. definitely harder when everyone does layoffs at once which always happens in my field. big true
[1:01:14] MedicineMan: @MrAxeffect Doubt that's an option. I was on the lower end of the pay scale.
[1:01:18] NipeArcade: Just learn to weld?
[1:01:21] LionButLeon: xdd
[1:01:21] Squats3: minecraft crocs?
[1:01:24] SolarSailFTL: PICS
[1:01:24] GrimFandango: @Maximum it's even more complicated - there's more spending on gaming than ever before. More devs will need to take Entrepreneurial classes to be functioning small businesses
[1:01:25] yeyanow: don't worry they will just crunch the exist people harder now
[1:01:25] Trodenskjold: Pog what colour

[1:01:34] Sandz15: crocs are bis. dont let anyone tell you differently

[1:35:13] kingcrow730: I think qtcinderella said if someone wins an award 3 years in a row they cant get nominated again for 2, just so the biggest streamers dont overwhelm the voting every year

[1:41:21] BIuffwatcher: green just seems more brighter!
[1:41:25] Squats3: feline stomp doesnt match the area to the effect. so you dont really know if youre standing in the right spot to get resets.
[1:41:25] schiavetto: yeah there's no shot that stays like that
[1:41:33] Varthar: they fired their epilepsy checking person

[1:42:21] treesdesu: Wasn't Blizzard busy imploding during that time tho?
[1:42:22] FortitudoMultis: Maybe by the time they figured out which abilities they were keeping it was too late to change the visuals
[1:42:25] Basic_3: @VelouriaVR Big layoffs
[1:42:40] BIuffwatcher: I kinda prefer it   same with dorky
[1:42:41] callmetedddd: You are done with season 3 d4?
[1:42:43] fdb33: rnt u able to separate the sound channels?

[1:42:50] Line_0: Sadge
[1:42:51] Mei_tricks: wish they would’ve kept blue dnd, that shit probably would look sick now
[1:42:51] Squats3: cant you separate your music into a different audio channel and capture just the non music stuff
[1:42:52] realGameTheory: yeah do split audio
[1:43:01] justmorm: can you play elevator music
[1:43:14] Line_0: sometimes that means videos will be muted on vods

[1:43:53] Chimix1: KEKW
[1:43:53] rangedonly_tv: Why does blizzard not nerf the overpowered affixes?
[1:43:59] jonpelf: they need an option for you as streamer to just pay the licensing fees to include them
[1:43:59] nerefwow: classic
[1:44:01] leubinator: valuable editor
[1:44:03] magicman133: GJ wentworth level marketing
[1:44:18] Squats3: @Maximum is there any chance we see them get rid of affixes other than tyran/fort for next season? im tired of affixes
[1:44:21] kaos1829: Missed opportunity for "gift 2 subs for horse, boy"
[1:44:22] Empirics_: But its so much better than it used to be
[1:44:22] SpeedyMcD: @maximum when do you think the alpha will come out? really curious to see the rest of the hero talents
[1:44:22] Xastin3: i really think they should just remove affixes and balance M+ without them
[1:44:25] Jarlan23: when they nerf the most annoying ones people find another affix to complain about
[1:44:26] Empirics_: Since it cant stack
[1:44:37] FortitudoMultis: Yeah Sanguine is was less punishing now
[1:44:39] nezo_pont: I think sanguine is less annoying than most affixes
[1:44:39] se_enginheiro: The range is smaller so
[1:44:43] fyrhuvud: it's just very frustrating
[1:44:44] nightst314: inspiring is worse according to RIO tracking
[1:44:44] twinkieruler95: @Maximum i asked this yesterday, but idk if you saw, do you think affixes should be more kiss curse? or more the same?
[1:44:44] Basic_3: As long as there are affixes, there will be a worst affix.
[1:44:49] surpriseparty20: They prob won't LUL
[1:44:52] hyruliaa: had fun in EB 26 with Sanguine earlier today
[1:44:54] dazonnn: Why is it a hard day at Blizzard?
[1:44:55] Lothland: They have to, but I doubt they will. it really seems like they have checked out of this expansion. 10.2.5 kinda shows it lol
[1:45:00] prodigy42: Bring back skittering!!!!
[1:45:02] AshinaNoble: can u pls run clockwise, this feels weird
[1:45:08] bluetheoffical: when is the new season ocming out?
[1:45:11] Basic_3: @dazonnn Big layoffs

[1:45:14] drkuju: @dazonnn layoffs
[1:45:14] Yagr6: fated firelands or something old
[1:45:16] draz1234567: why is it a hard day at blizzard?

[1:48:05] itsvizjira: didn't he quit working with spencer once before
[1:48:08] Exmachina126: It is made to seem as if he quit and if so, this is the most SICK PR move cause it is him leaving "in protest" of the layoffs.
[1:48:09] iccyc0ld: He got poached
[1:48:09] ryanchungo: he didn’t wanna work at Microsoft again lmfao
[1:48:12] Line_0: if he quit on his own there is no way he would announce it on this day though, unless its connected to the layoffs

[1:51:43] lugo1987: Duriel farming endgame super fun........
[1:51:44] Bigace1116: Like we have to get to the point of having things account bound esp if it takes like 50+ hours to max

[1:52:30] OG_Kawngi: it's so when you quit after a week it gives you a reason to come back for another week
[1:52:40] Sinergy_57: So people don't feel rushed to level at the start
[1:52:43] HealsAndThat: They want to retain the playerbase for a longer time, surely.
[1:52:45] zeitgeiz: it’s not a game you can jump into each season anymore like D3. taking what like 30-40 hours to hit max level?

[1:52:47] Sky_hbm: It's been ready since Diablo 3..

[1:59:35] fatgingi: I put that in the suggestions thing every single day for the last month @Maximum
[1:59:37] kingpeace09: they discount flightstones for alts, it should be crests too
[1:59:41] m_dep: transferring of crests shouldnt be controversial, theres still the cap on your main
[1:59:42] Drax_1224: multipler per each of those achievements u get for outgearing the currencies
[1:59:43] drall743: heroic should drop aspect at this point no reason not to
[1:59:43] Little_Cap: does this rat alt have the lego?
[1:59:44] BigTrout3: would unironically improve play time metrics
[1:59:45] Armagaren: flightstone grind is pretty booty
[1:59:45] Newbish4life: 10.2.5 added almost nothing (for me anyways) so I just prog M Council, and cri cause I play Feral
[1:59:46] ifuse: every x.5 patch prob

[2:00:09] Jaux2: @ZeroDMGDealt doesnt matter when you need to do 80 18s
[2:00:12] Arcsu: just buy boes and mythic clears Clueless
[2:00:12] dustin_handsupdb: Account W I D E
[2:00:13] Drageras: Yeah if they are shifting to a seasonal model then it really makes no sense to NOT invalidate the content they have before
[2:00:14] iccyc0ld: @ZeroDMGDealt 440 to low Sadge
[2:00:15] kurleth: i just dont get why they wont let crests be account bound come .5
[2:00:17] Lothland: all these people saying you can send 440 gear like that is even remotely close to what he's talking about
[2:00:18] clootz: nah I just tuned in wtf am I looking at

[2:00:24] PurpleKami: OMEGALUL 󠀀
[2:00:27] Armagaren: just bust in and start making demands
[2:00:28] SpeedyMcD: I really hope  fated is something good cus we have to wait probably 7 months for new content
[2:00:29] cucumbertoessniffa: maybe blizzard did testing to see more people stay around if players take a break from the game?
[2:00:30] marrree1: wait what is your gear
[2:00:35] ZeroDMGDealt: @Jaux2 true
[2:00:36] iccyc0ld: or allow you to send crest to your alts when you are maxed out
[2:00:36] Brossie: Maybe increase the crest count you get per dungeon every week, maybe start at 10 week1 and by week 5 you get 15 or smth
[2:00:40] ZeroDMGDealt: @iccyc0ld facts
[2:00:40] magicman133: @Maximum lay off them today okay buddy?
[2:00:40] m_dep: "if somebody wants to keep their job, I know what will make customers very happy"
[2:00:41] Ahrmanhamma: They need to make full Sparks weekly at least after a certain point. And Crests should be tradeable and/or have a cost reduction if you're far below the cap
[2:00:42] nairb1: maybe TWW aspects are warband-wide
[2:00:43] Virridian: @marrree1 ptr
[2:00:43] Clevelandmk: gonna train for mdi?
[2:00:44] silent_tv1: something like week 3 or 4 you get 2 extra crest from all sources. we are week 10 I think now so we would be getting like 26 from a completed dungeon or maybe 12 from deplete

[2:01:12] Slapsstick: Legendary? Pog
[2:01:12] Exmachina126: I feel like blizzard games just overall make it so difficult to level and play alts. D4 and WoW both have this problem.
[2:01:14] ShowDUH: were gonna keep quiet no worries
[2:01:18] jhopps12: dont worry its twitch chat, someone will ask about it in 30 seconds @Maximum

[2:31:23] Lvin62: @thebrocrow Late update due to clip being shown, but your ascii art of the person with crossed arms came out showing well on mobile, when I see chat in landscape mode. Not so much in portrait mode when chat is wider.

[2:33:23] StanRaenslen: it means that they are playing better than him, and if they are playing better than him, the boss will die
[2:33:26] dustin_handsupdb: I think he means to say "If you shit talking gets it out of your system so we can move on and kill this boss then do it"
[2:33:27] Reydien: nah, he's saying "why are you spending energy on this when you could be getting gud"
[2:33:28] Wincrediboy: shit-talking makes you feel better. feeling better makes you play better. DIRECT CORRELATION

[2:33:38] Exmachina126: Could lead to pretty solid banter and make the group morale go up i guess @Maximum
[2:33:38] BiBaButzeBenne: he also gets a little bit jittery voice at exactly the moment you are talking about
[2:33:40] CoffeeASAP: "Someone finally put Ralph in his place, this is the pull"
[2:33:40] TheBroCrow: arrogant asshole is gonna get a bad log if we kill it, everyone focus up
