[0:40:26] burne114: rdruid for sure

[0:44:14] Hyvest: @twitchsonic7 nah
[0:44:26] SmitikusPlays: Arms buffs can help it do comparable AOE damage with Fury but its tree doesn't support AOE and single target at the same time. Better but the underlying problem still exists
[0:44:28] reppap: @Hyvest i think critcake just plays was best out of the warrior specs, dont know how good buffed arms is though
[0:44:31] simon11111987: and DPS moan about getting into pugs, what’s the issue?

[3:37:43] Drohgoh: i think i wouldve held it.
[3:38:01] Drohgoh: it might just be too tight to do a mindbender every 45 seconds.
[3:38:11] Drohgoh: cuz if u could do evange 2 and 4. but 1 and 3 u just mindbender 15 atone.
[3:38:15] Drohgoh: u'd have a really tight time.
[3:38:29] ado2210: Pokemon ??
[3:38:52] Drohgoh: honestly you could just 15 atone for those 1st blaze so u just mindbender there.
[3:38:52] iloveuminkey: pookimon
[3:38:57] Drohgoh: then u could have it back for 2nd drop.
[3:39:05] Drohgoh: hes gonna evange 2nd drop
[3:39:22] Drohgoh: ya its 45 sec apart from each drop
[3:39:28] Drohgoh: so u could do 1 radiance -> have 2 for every drop.

[5:34:59] tomo65041: just interrupt and pray for others to do it
[5:35:07] Xastin3: cause like we said early healers find keys easy
[5:35:13] poroyou: thats literally insane
[5:35:17] ghantous: dont u want big knock instead of the upsie one
[5:35:19] poroyou: I trust no one in my groups to do anything right
[5:35:22] poroyou: keep that bar low
[5:35:30] SCxFaytal: ^
[5:35:37] epilepticunicorn_: @Xastin3 so you just grief people instead of helping?
[5:35:49] j0hnnnny_: and You wonder why u dont get inv to keys xd @xastin3

[5:36:19] maxwell_313: invited to what @Xastin3
[5:36:28] Xastin3: why? if dps cant push poly why do i want stress through rough key?
[5:36:31] smothgeko: @smothgeko i spelled it that way on purpose...
[5:36:57] epilepticunicorn_: why do you want to contribute to a group activity while in a group you signed up to participate in?
[5:36:57] Xastin3: i also hate incorp week
[5:37:03] Xastin3: its probably week i do least amount keys

[5:37:14] SCxFaytal: @lovestosplooge69 10/10
[5:37:35] daveisfaker: @Xastin3 not the worst policy, i think most people find 'hardlining' like that to be a bit severe but i get it.
[5:37:37] Minigamer911: NonVerbal
[5:37:46] poroyou: quiet quitting
[5:38:13] vellocets: your lava burst does more than my ele shaman's

[5:38:40] IAttackYou: british broadcasting company right
[5:38:47] daveisfaker: @vellocets i hate how Blizz doesn't let ele actually get big numbers because of our mastery.
[5:38:50] Xastin3: thats fair daveisfaker. i just hate dps mentality that every affix is healers problem
[5:39:11] smothgeko: right up there with a rouge named scatlove i had a while back
[5:39:29] Xastin3: i had key last week for afflicted... the tank invited 3 non dispell dps. the tank didnt spec into his dispell

[5:40:37] velidien: is there an addon for talent tree? make it like better for loadouts and shit?
[5:40:55] Xastin3: i wonder if shaman does like discpriest / rdruid level of damage now
[5:40:56] Minigamer911: Mages aren't people, rogues cry over losing 1 combo point, tanks are oblivious, and I forgot about the shadow almost as much as Blizzard did Kappa
[5:41:03] poroyou: Talent Loadout EX
[5:41:27] Adrang: I second Talent Loadout Ex
[5:41:43] velidien: Adge but thanks chat

[5:42:37] christigiggity: they changed it
[5:42:51] goodsorc: its just for healing now no?
[5:42:52] cactuar7: didn't they change prim wave to *only* be offensive or defensive based on spec'
[5:43:03] christigiggity: promise lol

[5:49:27] andu854: opinions on rshamn buff?

[5:54:20] MierkaBlue: I hope you get good prog tomorrow, but I also hope less "I'm not sexist" or toxic takes and mood overall for reals. Tends to make things better. <3
[5:54:24] ewbrad: how was vault this week for you growl?
[5:54:28] Bingo_Charlie: In your zero to hero series I noted that you hardly used (if ever) chain heal.  Was that a mana conservation thing?
[5:54:44] IAmSolari: peat keys  Pog
[5:54:51] Bingo_Charlie: gottcha
[5:54:56] Xastin3: chainheal has like 20 talents now

[5:56:53] Bingo_Charlie: That said, monk and pally are loads of fun
[5:57:05] andu854: they shouldve brought back chain harvest instead of shitty PW

[5:57:32] Bingo_Charlie: mine or G's?
[5:57:33] velidien: @andu854 chain was my shit, it looks so fuckin cool too
[5:57:39] goodsorc: goodsorc subscribed at Tier 1. 
[5:57:51] Silencbank: maybe chain harvest will be a hero talent
[5:58:06] andu854: @velidien it was amazing and its literally another version of rshaman signature ability
[5:58:24] Bingo_Charlie: For me I am not a resto druid fan.
[5:58:31] Taicho116: People can say what they want but winning is almost always more fun then not winning
[5:58:33] andu854: why they didnt use that instead will forever blow my mindf
