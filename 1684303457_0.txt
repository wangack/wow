[5:49:22] fpschoppa: what did andrew tate do to u guys KEK
[5:49:22] osoi____: shroud do you have 5 on it?
[5:49:30] rioterz1: true but still a bad take
[5:49:45] Ashamintallu: @suspectttt not to us, he's just trafficking young girls for prostitution
[5:49:46] bowpen: yeah. to lead guy everything is black and white lol
[5:49:47] JiminyCrick3t: he LITERALLY said that people who criticise andrew tate are just cherry picking bad stuff he says and that he isnt a bad guy, literally how is that not defending him shroud
[5:50:00] fpschoppa: @suspectttt source?
[5:50:14] lwisecarver: Anything good Andrew Tate says can be found in another person without all the vile shit he says

[5:51:09] MCSwagdooodle: Not a lot of people look at both sides of a story, so have a biased opinion
[5:51:18] ChubbyMikey: chat, this is not the place to discuss the merits of Andrew Tate, or the lack of them

[5:52:02] disisahorse: The only rumor I've heard that turned out to be true was regarding shrouds ant the thickness of his co.......
[5:52:20] LegendaryBdiddy: the discussion of tate is a moot point, you either agree with his opinions or you dont. no one changes their mind and they just dig in. not even worth discussing
[5:52:25] leadtooth: right but if someone says something very publicly ..
[5:52:30] Ashamintallu: @krutzzzzzzz what fake media, he's under investigation by the directorate for organized crime in romania

[5:58:34] Lightbru: It was specific social sites, like Mastodon, the twitter alternative @shroud
[5:58:35] MCSwagdooodle: it makes sense tbh, why would you advertise a rival company, think of the latest pepsi ad with Santa
[5:58:36] sp33d3r: FALSE - You cannot have an account that is DEDICATED to providing links.
[5:58:39] lwisecarver: If you had go follow my IG in your twitter bio that wouldnt be allowed

[5:59:11] Snakemeister: yeah totally not bad... free speech >:)
[5:59:13] Nisl: no more free advertisement... oh no
[5:59:13] fuzwuz: @shroud basically a ton of big influencers were moving off twitter to a competitor called Mastadon, and tweeting "this is my last tweet find me here", so twitter banned people from advertising mastadon essentially
[5:59:22] round_top: ppl just want to whine about twitter
[5:59:28] Nisl: free speech is fine, free advertisement is not xD
[5:59:30] sp33d3r: People are butt-hurt looking for anything to complain about - welcome to 2022.
[5:59:31] BroL1: @NssPhil it has always been open. It looks bad to make a change like that now
[5:59:39] Develhuntr75: you can never tweet something like "check out my newest youtube vid"
[5:59:48] lwisecarver: It's more about how big of a departure it is I'd imagine
