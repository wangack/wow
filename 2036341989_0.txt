[1:31:26] Deadge_Gartic: @insaniacc_ so is dwarf as a race Starege
[1:32:02] Deadge_Gartic: savix volume too low
[1:32:03] Uogien: Some1 stop this AI from generating those: https://clips.twitch.tv/BenevolentPopularMuleEleGiggle-oZ9qIMzIxDtLidfX

[1:33:14] fallendarkone220: the thing is its putting the bar higher and higher making it rly hard for new players or "weekend" players who just want to have fun
[1:33:17] ArchspireWoW: Sims are super fun to play around with, they help you decide what upgrades to go for and which are best
[1:33:23] Uogien: Some1 stop this AI from generating those: https://clips.twitch.tv/BenevolentPopularMuleEleGiggle-oZ9qIMzIxDtLidfX

[1:33:33] KaizeeRx: LULW
[1:33:38] earlmillions_: yea sims are more of a guide
[1:33:40] photek_tn: I think its awesome that the end users of wow often times find exploits that the devs didnt think of. If its in game, use it imo.
[1:33:46] chizukekii: im glad the student warrior is taking his classes seriously

[2:00:04] Norcore: @DangerousMusabi victory rush makes leveling somewhat better but not by a lot
[2:00:19] ye1l: @Comixs I mean I just wanna clear the easy as shit raid in 30 mins rather than play with noobs doing 130 dps so I can be done with it and actually play the game

[2:01:13] I_Am_Fletch: who doesn't like to pump? Gachi
[2:01:23] Deadge_Gartic: tbh classic raids no matter which version doesnt excite me anyway LULW
[2:01:26] Deadge_Gartic: pump or not
[2:01:27] insaniacc_: The thing with worldbuffs in classic is that its basically a buffer, so when mistakes happen, it doesnt really matter cuz u nuke it down anyway
[2:01:52] ye1l: @Comixs it's 2-3 min of ur time to clear it 20 min faster though, unless you deliberately choose to make it as slow as possible to get them
[2:02:00] snorkeltime: who tf this druid
[2:02:18] DangerousMusabi: @snorkeltime Savix's pet
[2:02:23] ye1l: like sure if u walk to opposite side of the world to get dmf instead of getting summed or whatever it's gonna take a lot of time, but if you're not self griefing it takes literal minutes to get buff
[2:02:24] Deadge_Gartic: @Comixs exactly
[2:02:33] Orudila: the ppl you meet in mmorpgs these days though ... you can consider yourself lucky if you get mates that atleast somewhat know what their skills do
[2:03:06] StreamElements: Check out the Best VPN Surfshark -> https://surfshark.deals/SavixVPN
[2:03:09] ye1l: @Comixs people selling summs to mulgore and elwynn 24/7 even on "dead" realms lol
[2:03:33] insaniacc_: i personally like to pump but I would never make all worldbuffs mandatory for my run unless we have like a set goal going. Like a parse run
[2:03:48] Deadge_Gartic: i mean tbh i'm not talking about world buffs only
[2:03:55] Deadge_Gartic: classic raiding doesnt excite me even slighest
[2:04:11] Kerriell: it's a social thing
[2:04:13] jo_inro: Have you played US pokemon the game yet, @Savix ?
[2:04:24] shinra40: index hates dual spec , i cant respect their opinion om
[2:04:34] insaniacc_: Yeah, thats a part too. Getting worldbuffs means you have to run around, it enables WPVP too
[2:04:46] imat___: I just hope they level cap the new world buffs in SoD
[2:04:47] I_Am_Fletch: Isn't that a good thing If It feels bad to lose It though?
[2:04:59] DangerousMusabi: Chronoboon makes WB so much easier
[2:05:09] BlueZense: just give us a npc for buffs like china
[2:05:20] Lyna22: ye but all that takes so much time
[2:05:21] Deadge_Gartic: @Savix i didnt talk about wb's tho
[2:05:23] insaniacc_: my favourite times of classic was messing around WPVPing in felwood and thats only a thing cuz of Songflower
[2:05:33] Deadge_Gartic: i am saying raiding in classic kinda doesnt excite me even slighest
[2:05:37] Deadge_Gartic: for me classic is just wpvp
[2:05:39] Turbopumper: my guild used to have multiple warlocks placed all around the world in OG Classic, we just summoned everyone around LUL
[2:05:44] I_Am_Fletch: Index wants a part 2 of that btw
[2:06:14] ye1l: for me only thing with dual talents is that you should only be able to change specs in inns/towns etc
