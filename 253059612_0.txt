It IS an issue with Australian Internet -- specifically with Telstra and ANY ISP that resells Telstra -- but it doesn't affect any other website and it doesn't affect Optus, iiNet, etc.

[1:38:11] Noobanidus: @ApocJosh @GankSinatra Half the teams haven't been able to practice properly because of the connectivity issues that started BEFORE The official start of the tournament. This entire tournament is really unfair because the Korean teams have no issues, and one of the Australian teams have no issues due to ISP choice, but every other team has at least one player who is unable to play /simply becauses they're using the most popular ISP with the biggest m arket share in Australia/.

At some point in time he was actually deported for overstaying and/or violating the terms of his visa. Hence, "Free Marsy". Likewise, Pumps was the tank of Warler et al's team (from Honestly), but because he had an account action within the past 6 months, the entire team was disqualified from playing. Ergo, "Free Pumps".
