[5:57:27] wowyraz: Swifty I remember you from way back in the days... Back in vanilla when you figured out how to keep your weapons glowing and going out of bounce.. Just seeing you and listening to you speak brings back memories. Feeling almost emotional from the memories.. Dunno, just thank you for the contribution to this game, I guess.. Means a lot. @swifty
