[1:36:52] madilen43: the problem with necrotic was that depends on the tank its was OK or trash, for example for paly necrotic is non existent
[1:37:03] Panasonic82: Necrotic was like completely different affixes depending on which tank you play. Some rely on self-healing and some from damage reduction, and that is ass if you ask me

[2:32:20] strike879: i hope they make everything scale able on a gather char i like having a big mini map
[2:32:22] Rottencoarse: he broke it chat XD
[2:32:57] KhetumTV: By work you mean theres only 4 bugs left right? Kappa
[2:33:14] ChrisarN: Vengeance havent changed since talent release
[2:33:22] Rottencoarse: damn 1k gold
[2:33:25] KhetumTV: coz im pretty sure mad paragon and stuff still aint working with Sentinel?
[2:33:36] zeeAbe: Plus if you don't need the runes they will sell for a lot of gold early on
[2:33:37] Rottencoarse: dont think so @Towelliee
[2:33:42] CtrlAltJord: Satchel on live is the same
[2:33:44] strike879: and like 1k+ for the rune at the start
[2:33:50] CtrlAltJord: 800-1k gold + runes
[2:33:56] Shrenko: 1000 gold is that really that much nowadays
[2:34:20] strike879: without table those runes are worth a fortune
[2:34:41] CtrlAltJord: on launch they'll be very expensive, since on LFR as well
[2:34:55] nvnto: they are mostly vers pieces
[2:34:56] CtrlAltJord: no lfr*
[2:35:00] jh0nny2k: how can I possibly decide which class/spec to main?
[2:35:15] zeeAbe: @strike879 Can't remember if SL table gave them early on, but in WoD I remember them being hundreds of gold each early on because the only real source was the bags
[2:35:34] EggWrath: Playing the beta, just from a UI perspective, do u find urself missing addons? Or is it pretty customizable
[2:36:17] silodin: BS is slightly bugged, can't learn recipes

[2:38:12] cowfacemaster: bis raid trinkets
[2:38:33] Lintgamer: Any idea when there will be new beta invites for people who opt in?
[2:38:37] strike879: @zeeAbe they did but only at high lvl table ive sold them for 850 gold and on ondermine journal the time they sold them for that much was at Jan 21
[2:38:43] masenka_: its a fine line cause if they are super easy to level then they dont really mean anything
[2:38:44] silodin: ironic
[2:38:50] falldrgn: Imean I feel like if you get raid X difficulty you should get crafting matts on par with that level, with the chance for a higher tier to drop, not b elow
[2:39:10] CtrlAltJord: why should they change it just to appease world first raiders
[2:39:14] XiMoee: @Lintgamer they do that every new beta build. so once a week.
[2:39:38] JerBoody: There isn’t any other power gain grinding system though right? So maybe crafting is the new AP grind lol
[2:39:39] silodin: So how do you level your BS
[2:39:44] Lintgamer: @Lintgamer One day i will get in :(

[5:31:09] Aidler: @TacDuc if YT likes you
[5:31:09] 91Niki: @91Niki They are actually testing it on some streams. I just have NO clue why it isn't just their main way to run ads
[5:31:10] WonderMog: Literally the only game I see a major streamer on is Total war:Warhammer. Every other game i've seen twitch has bigger streamers
[5:31:22] GamingDad77: @91Niki if not banners at the bottom, have the ads run in a minimized screen so we can still see the stream
[5:31:24] warrenny: Is evoker essence like dk runes?
[5:31:38] Skizzurp: thats the best part of live on YT honestly if nay1 is looking they will find you
[5:31:48] Skizzurp: on twitch shit there are thousands of people who stream here
[5:31:57] apollobaker: they dont understand why they dont use banner ads more, I wouldnt mind those as long as I can here the streamer
[5:31:58] Rhoncer: this is a cool visual
[5:32:03] 91Niki: @91Niki The banners are actually amazing, cuz they just push the player up just a tiny bit. You can still watch the stream and hear the stream audio. No clue why it isn't become the main way to run ads
[5:32:12] Relic7: For levelling a fresh toon now, are they scaling XP gain so that you get from 1 to 60 via old expacs - and then the new expac for 60 to 70? @Towelliee
[5:32:16] Skizzurp: the knowledge drops off things you gather

[5:33:48] 91Niki: 390 yes
[5:33:48] pent217: yes
[5:33:49] EnryanGryphos: yeah
[5:33:49] HaxzorJimDuggan: might be to kill the double crafting meta, force a gathering on you
[5:33:53] roji_gaming: We should be able to have 2 crafting and 2 gathering skill on the same character
[5:34:05] Vanthe84: will it be possible to max them all out?
[5:34:11] TheCheeseWheel87: @Towelliee there are dailies you can do in each zone as you are building rep with each dragon flight. they reward quite a bit knowledge

[5:35:02] Nokterian: THE HELM LORD
[5:35:07] CyndaQuillin: knowledge is the new azerite
[5:35:11] belaham: Ive gotten a knowledge when I first craft something
[5:35:18] GamingDad77: @91Niki or what us guys learn to do after we hit puberty
[5:35:18] Lenietwitch: i wonder if you can respect just in case someone screw up, that would be painfulx.x
[5:35:25] foofighters182: it’s gonna take a month?
[5:35:27] EnryanGryphos: Go all in on shields. Rising of the Shield Hero: WoW edition

[5:35:31] 91Niki: @GamingDad77 KEKW
[5:35:32] darkdestroz: The crafted Molten armor is better then the pvp gear, in terms of Ilvl

[5:35:52] GamingDad77: @91Niki true
[5:36:12] Rastailian: @91niki @gamingdad77 LUL
[5:36:17] belaham: I think you only get it the first time you craft something @Towelliee
[5:36:30] EKS90_: @foofighters182 They did say that maxing out the entire crafting proffs with all knowledge and all specs would be a "long task "
[5:36:37] belaham: Yea
[5:36:46] Rakim88: thats the 2nd time ur first craft gave u knowledge
[5:36:47] EKS90_: @mcace2310 not timegate I think, just making it take a long time, they already talked about it.
[5:36:49] Rakim88: rest didnt
[5:36:56] Rudric_Ice: so the end game grind is basically crafting
[5:37:02] Rakim88: so only first time?
[5:37:03] Skizzurp: which makes sense

[5:37:11] HaxzorJimDuggan: kinda like in ff14 the first time you make something its a big xp boost compared to every other time

[5:39:57] ObsidianHealer: well it is just revamped but its mindless from the looks
[5:39:58] Titannborn: I was thinking I was going to some type of bar power not a system of crafting
[5:39:59] GamingDad77: towRee towRee towRee

[5:40:44] Isthon_: !beta keys
[5:40:47] manmower: timegate the knowledge at start, so you don't outpace dungeons and raids
[5:40:47] dammit_odra: So will crafting now feel more similar to a rep grind?
[5:41:09] iamWaritself: I wonder if crafting is in a good state now with the revamp or not.
[5:41:09] Rakim88: to be fair the system just started to get added this last week really in practice. so now feedback phase starts on it.
[5:41:11] Myrgoth: are you going to play wotlk ?
[5:41:16] EKS90_: That is why its going to take soem time to get " every specc up to max " cause they want people to use the crafting orders and actually buy things from other players, but if u wanna do everything you can, just gotta play more. but its not mandatory in any sense.,
[5:41:19] Titannborn: My bad didn’t know that was new crafting systems they are dope asf looking making it interesting
[5:41:20] 0doz: the ilvl of the crafting gear is "similar to raid" items ?
[5:41:21] KhalaVenix: it looks very familiar to ffxiv crafting a lot
[5:41:35] BennyBellum: anyone else feel that wow needs its 'a realm reborn' moment?
[5:41:38] alabranches: @Towelliee U think this time the prot warrior will be viable for endgame in DF?
[5:41:45] GamingDad77: I swear...no one ever listens to interviews or reads blue posts... NotLikeThis
[5:41:51] darkdestroz: @Towelliee the primal molten gear u are crafting is better then the pvp gear u buy,
[5:41:53] EKS90_: Professions is not even a mandatory thing, you dont HAVE to do any of this.
[5:41:55] mrkenndy: @BennyBellum they dont have the guts to do that

[5:43:50] zenFX_: lease
[5:43:59] EKS90_: @GamingDad77 True shit, like, all olf the profession stuff is already explained, maxingout the trees is possible but its not whats suppose to happen the first weeks. its if yo wanna be a master crafter. its a endgame system now.

[5:45:43] 0doz: all that "crafting rework" for a "normal raid loot" would be bad af
[5:45:45] EKS90_: They did want u to craft high end gear now, but it might be recipe locked or something like that.

[5:50:52] Jango_: So what do you guys think for WOTLK classic,  2 1h frost dk or Feral Druid?
[5:51:06] gutzkun: Did you review warrior stuff already ?
[5:51:09] mrkenndy: @Jango_ anything DK over bear lol
[5:51:18] ObsidianHealer: From what it looks like you need 150 Concentrated Primal Focus to transform it into Concentrated Primal Infusion. (This is from WoWhead).
[5:51:27] Titannborn: When is pre patch
[5:51:29] Jango_: @Jango_ No, im talking cat druid
[5:51:37] sirdanube: @Towelliee  can we craft tiers sets in df like we do right now?
[5:51:45] mrkenndy: ok @Jango_ anything DK over feral lol
[5:51:46] 91Niki: @Jango_ Afraid I can't answer that question, cuz I'm bias towards feral LUL
[5:51:51] ObsidianHealer: It doesnt tell me where it is either >.<
[5:52:01] domlator: Do we have a real release date?
[5:52:13] EKS90_: u need to do the craft order thing.
[5:52:15] Jango_: @91Niki  same here thats what i play on retail
[5:52:17] phattboi_80: not even through work orders?
[5:52:19] manmower: do it through work orders
[5:52:19] Rakim88: u can make money of the order listed tho now
[5:52:21] Gragnar: you're supposed to do crafting orders
[5:52:22] Titannborn: First raid reminds me on tot gear scaling through out the raid minus the thunder forge gear ⚙️
[5:52:26] Rocman: you can sell through the order system
[5:52:27] saevenar: no you can do work orders and then they have it bop on their end
[5:52:32] Rocman: if you get the BOP item
[5:52:37] tedol: what is leaked date?
[5:52:44] laforgez00: what is the leaked release date?
[5:52:52] EKS90_: True, you are correct on that.
[5:52:53] Vanthe84: are work orders working for test yet?
[5:52:54] tedol: oh
[5:52:55] Rocman: yer thats good
[5:52:57] MILESkg21: really monkaS
[5:53:00] EKS90_: u cannot buy a full mythic crafted set.
[5:53:00] Karbonn: Looking like the leaked date is more and more plausible, especially after the latest patch.
[5:53:02] EKS90_: with tokens
[5:53:07] Rakim88: yea isnt it u do the work order but the bop item is on that person now
[5:53:33] Kale_Nd: @Towelliee wasn't that restriction removed already ? you can wear full set of crafted
[5:53:39] manmower: i thought you can wear all crafted now
[5:53:41] zenkodac: you cant buy the crafted gear unless you do the content or are a crafter yourself
[5:53:46] DramaticTv: you can have a full crafted set if you can make it
[5:53:53] Rakim88: Hmm
[5:53:55] Phil87z: I feel like after wrath launches we get the pre patch and release date. If 11/28 is true they can’t wait much longer

[5:56:26] sperg0verlord: fck you pay meeee
[5:56:26] domlator: My guess is you will need to clear LFR to get mats for Normal, then Normal for Heroic etc...
[5:56:26] HonestPhilosophy: Its a gift not for services
[5:56:27] zenkodac: not if its a e sports org
[5:56:33] zeeAbe: They will have people lining up that are willing to donate the materials, time and effort. Hell they would probably PAY to craft for them instead of having them pay you.

[5:56:42] canademon: wouldnt getting paid in massive amounts of gold be fine?
[5:56:48] Jack_the_Dipper: Most of the time they already have crafters because they need crafter that have gold that have the gold to buy the mats first
[5:56:48] 91Niki: @Towelliee I think it depends. Are they paying money for the MATS or the hourly rate?
[5:56:51] NotDillyTV: Get me that Liquid contract
[5:56:53] agentblaster123: well it is called "Terms of SERVICE" so it is still against :D

[5:56:58] Manabucho: @Towelliee Max said that the only way it could be legal was to sign job contracts with crafter to pay real money
[5:57:08] Zippaya: the actual players are payed right

[7:34:18] MILESkg21: but each boss in 14 is like 30 minutes long LuL
[7:34:38] Moronil: those 4 bosses are... so good tho
[7:34:42] Gian_Cena: @Towelliee i mean
[7:34:50] manmower: casuals already thought all the bosses were challenging
[7:35:01] Mecabeast: no 9ne in wow wants a boss that's more than 10mins to kill
[7:35:17] Prisana: Do prot pallies in wotlk have any self sustain like they do in retail with instant cast heals?
[7:35:19] MILESkg21: what was the dumb raid with 2 bosses in bfa ??
[7:35:22] kilaran: Mythic is for the 1% guys and casuals go to mythic later on after nerfs :)
[7:35:35] OverlordMike25: i want to specialize in mainly doing crafting this xpack (yes i know im a filthy casual yada yada lol) but i also like dragons so want to go drakthyr ...will i be at a major disadvantage not choose a class with a crafting bonus

[7:36:02] Gian_Cena: @Towelliee its tru ffxiv bosses are wild tho lol
[7:36:03] Dcarter: @Mecabeast depend on how fun on the boss is tbh
[7:36:19] abracka_: that's one of my issues with XIV raiding, not a fan of how long some of those fights are
[7:36:25] Gian_Cena: yeah
[7:36:29] Moronil: casuals in 14 have alliance raids, normal raids and normal extremes, they good
[7:36:36] Ezareal: @MilesKG21 Crucible?
[7:36:39] abracka_: could take a 15 min nap, come back and the fight still isn't over
[7:36:45] Sh0rtR0und: we need a wildstar that doesnt fail. lol
[7:36:46] 91Niki: Sup @Dcarter ijpHI

[7:36:52] Gian_Cena: @Towelliee wow raiding is my fave
[7:36:59] Dcarter: dcwHi @91Niki
[7:37:02] emznev: crucible of stroms miles
[7:37:07] abracka_: @Sh0rtR0und riot's mmo hopefully towCopium towCopium towCopium
[7:37:55] DallTV_: haii ya all
[7:37:56] hammack52: here is the the ff14 bosses are really not that hard, what makes them feel hard is the fact that the class design is so conviluded with have like 20+ abilities that you have to keep track of through out a fight.
[7:38:04] 91Niki: @DallDK ijpHI
[7:38:20] MILESkg21: @Ezareal YES that one
[7:38:27] reggiepowa: agreed
[7:38:34] JOEadelphia: I just got you starter kit in the mail. sticker is top notch, the shaker is cool and my first flavor I tried is the focus acai blueberry.
[7:38:38] MILESkg21: fuck the crucible
[7:38:39] Dcarter: thats bc Legion was beautiful
[7:38:39] PvtHudson093: I wouldnt mind some 1 boss raids like Ony again
[7:38:53] Rudric_Ice: yes bring back 3 man raids
[7:39:00] CritcobainTV: the blueberry one had a chalky aftertaste for me
[7:39:00] Rudric_Ice: i mean 3 boss
[7:39:21] Moronil: at the end of the day I enjoy the differences between wow and ff, makes me wanna play both
[7:39:25] Siddydiddydo: I hope we get some single boss sanctum style raids
[7:39:26] spookychefkarolina: Omg that’s like my #1. So sad they’re sold out lol
[7:39:26] onous_: Btw @towelliee Andor is really bad... Like worse then the Star Wars Holiday Special.
[7:39:26] manmower: 15 boss raids and make them all more challenging
[7:39:30] JOEadelphia: it's pretty good. I'll let you know my favorite in a week or so
[7:39:33] thetrumenshow: i like the small 10 mans like  kara and za coming out along side the 25 mans
[7:39:35] Ezareal: Isn't part of the WoW raid design is that there are some bosses that are just gimmes for loot?

[7:42:38] MILESkg21: 25 was more casual
[7:42:42] zeeAbe: The only way we get 10 player raids is that the player count in mythic gets cut in half
[7:42:43] Rakim88: repeating cata mistakes again would be huge fail by blizz
[7:42:45] Mecabeast: 10 man raiding is a pain if you have dps that aren't geared
[7:42:45] piratechris: Wow ended up in a russian av with russians preaching politics... jeez
[7:42:48] manmower: 10man is the world first, 25 has 2.5x people to get the same accomplishment

[7:45:18] manmower: FF14 pvp is more skill-based than WoW
[7:45:19] reggiepowa: its like challenge mode dungeons
[7:45:22] onishogun77: no, ff dungeons are not brain dead...
[7:45:24] swoopdawooshh: im casual in ffxiv and i can pretty much turn off my brain
[7:45:25] Pwncakee: FF dongoens are the same .. do big pull (double pack at start) AOE them down. go pass the barrier. kill boss. big pull again . double pack AOE down. kill boss.
[7:45:34] onishogun77: that guy sounds like a neckbeard
[7:45:41] Fenixzzz: they should make raids to gradually make the bosses get harder and make the loot more desirable for the end game raiders and make the fisrt bosses more accesible to average player, at the end everyone gets loot from the bosses
[7:45:43] Sh0rtR0und: LFR is a competition to see who can try the least. just saying
[7:45:43] reggiepowa: classes barely have aoe rotations though, still gonna be bad

[7:47:09] Siddydiddydo: even if they made it harder, someone would jsut invent a better addon to do it for you
[7:47:23] Timothious: Folks don't want to pay for content they don't get to see
[7:47:25] im_capy: need something similar to a torghast boss roulette for solo/3 man groups with more incentives
[7:47:40] pushnoir: naowh is just mad that he has to reclear so many bosses, thats all there is to it
[7:47:44] MILESkg21: the 1% doesnt think about the rest of us
[7:47:44] dschmidt: The hate LFR gets is because people forget what it is, it is (or at least it was) an entry point for people who don't raid but allows them to experience it. You then get raiders who join and shit on people who clearly are learning.
[7:47:55] TheTokyoDevil: ff14 bad game

[7:49:15] Dcarter: farm is the worst part of raiding
