[0:43:24] br0fest0r: It's end of WoD all over again with the WA's
[0:43:25] meatbe4t: pvp retail is very fine
[0:43:29] Trexbo_: Shruge that's just to be efficient, it's not required
[0:43:30] meatbe4t: mythic community is harsh
[0:43:32] toooth: I remember when guzu was raid leading heroic razsageth
[0:43:33] th4les: blizzard should ban weakauras and addons
[0:43:39] Trexbo_: Wat
[0:43:44] Trexbo_: Leveling is so good now
[0:43:46] CALOT_ROGUE: You hop on retail and are like there’s a zillion things to do….
[0:43:49] Trexbo_: IMO
[0:43:53] ani_kage: yeah but after that. its overhwelming
[0:43:59] Tibainium: leveling after Exile’s Reach gets so bad though
[0:44:00] Trexbo_: YEP
[0:44:00] Smooo07: retail Misery

[0:44:19] enzo_08310: @Trexbo_ its fast, but its not good
[0:44:20] Motoclash: with the next retail addon will be dragonisles
[0:44:20] CALOT_ROGUE: Retail - Lonely AF no one talks
[0:44:25] zorpotv: @Vertigo_GB not if you have a single awareness that the game has multiple expansions
[0:44:27] ani_kage: i like vanilla because its simple and fun
[0:44:28] MeowgicTheCathering: next expac when they make dragonflight 10-70 lvling it will be smoother

[0:45:22] meatbe4t: @imdeazyz 100% beast dungeon list or all xpac
[0:45:24] Kathelexidonia: And you can't finish the storyline before you're level for the newest expanssion
[0:45:41] imdeazyz: yup ^^
[0:45:41] t4pekid: retail is 90% end game
[0:45:43] MeowgicTheCathering: hmjj how does ff14 handle this with their msq
[0:45:55] Shiggitty: yeah retail is level to max in 15m then endgame LUL
[0:45:59] CALOT_ROGUE: Retail is not even Wow…it’s a butchered step child of Wow
[0:46:00] Tibainium: blizzard just wants you to buy their boosts
[0:46:03] toter_s: @Guzu hey man you remember what were top dps in cata?
[0:46:08] Mr_Moffert: PepoG i see
[0:46:15] mordiell: @toter_s he didnt play cata
[0:46:20] smithers0351: Oldge we are the problem
[0:46:21] Shiggitty: wolfaG
[0:46:23] meatbe4t: retail is when you get to max level you make an alt and start again
[0:46:26] maxwell_rs3: i just started playing in sod
[0:46:33] Arlique246: they might reset that now with the worldsoul saga, 3 expansions?
[0:46:40] Smooo07: i couldnt bring myself to keep playing retail after legion
[0:46:49] geennaamnl1: I would call myself very lucky to be born in the 90's so I could enjoy WoW <3
[0:46:50] MeowgicTheCathering: me with 30+ max lvls Aware
[0:46:51] meatbe4t: i fucking love levelling in retail
[0:46:56] Smooo07: i miss legion sajj
[0:46:58] Shiggitty: evoker and demon hunter is too good xD
[0:47:11] Elijahss: Retail is pretty much WoW 2 compared to Classic
[0:47:14] Lissard: prewatched LULE
[0:47:28] meatbe4t: add dungeon finder in classic and everything is awesome
[0:47:29] mlady_telegramz97: PREWATCHED
[0:47:32] mlady_telegramz97: PogO

[0:47:47] mordiell: tbh this is pretty okay now
[0:47:47] Smooo07: thiss
[0:47:48] CALOT_ROGUE: Guzu if there was a gun to your head and you had to choose to get rid of Retail or SOD, what would you choose?
[0:47:54] mlady_telegramz97: thiss
[0:47:54] Kazay1998: I thought I would be super late when I went to the gym, turns out Guzu is latezu as well.  Hello Guzu and chat peepoSit

[0:48:19] mackattack4208: Good Morning Chat
[0:48:20] Smooo07: oooooooooh
[0:48:21] MeowgicTheCathering: Kazay1998 hugg
[0:48:25] Kazay1998: @mordiell @mlady_telegramz97 @Mr_Moffert @Parshce @Smooo07 alowo
[0:48:25] buttmcgeee: mordiell stareChamp
[0:48:27] t4pekid: Boomerzu glol
[0:48:28] meatbe4t: for new players it is 100% haha
[0:48:28] Nikoftz27: OneGuy
[0:48:30] HeadShot794: HUGGIES @Kazay1998 CHEER
[0:48:34] Kazay1998: @MeowgicTheCathering alowo
[0:48:37] meatbe4t: just made my friend star a few weeks ago he'S still lost
[0:48:37] mlady_telegramz97: there is no new players for wow
[0:48:38] Ewriick: I stopped in BFA, returned and was confused
[0:48:38] mlady_telegramz97: wdym
[0:48:39] Pweefy1: Ive played forever and the new DF crafting system was overwhelming imo
[0:48:40] Kazay1998: @HeadShot794 Denthey
[0:48:40] mlady_telegramz97: om
[0:48:40] vxicexo: vault is free loot though no? Play the game get your weekly vault
[0:48:42] Hansen_: Then i assume as a new player u watch guides etc 2min video makes u understand crafting
[0:48:43] mikkelssen: felt like that in a loooong while in retail imo
[0:48:44] Smooo07: honestly it's been to much for me trying dragonflight after skipping alot of stuff
[0:48:47] shamshield79: i started in Shadowlands and it was rough... now just a classic andy
[0:48:48] mordiell: retail has a LOT of currencies now, thats the most confusing part
[0:48:49] Smooo07: Kazay1998 alowo
[0:48:50] mlady_telegramz97: @kazay1998 alowo
[0:48:54] Ewriick: @Pweefy1 at least they made crafting somewhat relevant again
[0:48:55] Tibainium: when you reach max level you get like 50 new quests aswell
[0:48:59] Trexbo_: YEP It's hard to imagine what it's like for a new player. Like look at the Uberdanger videos, even CLASSIC can be overwhelming for a complete new player.
[0:48:59] Boneyards_666: guzuL guzuL guzuL guzuL
[0:49:00] CALOT_ROGUE: The vault is the dumbest thing ever created in Wow
[0:49:02] SisterFriedesFeet: i've not played since BFA and i still found it overwhelming, so i just played wrath instead
[0:49:02] thedirtbagel: You're correct, it's very confusing to jump into. Very little explanation of how to progress for new players
[0:49:03] mlady_telegramz97: WAYTOODANK
[0:49:05] meatbe4t: crafting orders are nice ONCE you get the hang of it
[0:49:07] Kazay1998: @Smooo07 I tried it a few days ago. I got so fucking overwhelmed om
[0:49:07] 3Brick_: WAYTOODANK
[0:49:08] mordiell: no matter what you do you get bags full of currencies and upgrades and you ahve no idea what to do with them
[0:49:09] toooth: mordiell is a retail giga gamer, she knows everything Clue
[0:49:13] lord_windir: YEP
[0:49:16] meatbe4t: GUZU POG
[0:49:18] handovdoom666: if I was a new player coming into say Lost Ark I would feel the same way. I would need to watch videos and read up on things.
[0:49:19] mordiell: @toooth true NODDERS
[0:49:19] mikkelssen: Not only dragonflight
[0:49:23] Pweefy1: @Ewriick that so true, the change was absolutely for the best, but took me a min to get used to
[0:49:23] Mr_Moffert: you need a very high IQ to play retail
[0:49:28] sparxies: its worse now
[0:49:28] Hansen_: u litteraly just spam +17 dungeons for gear :D
[0:49:31] Smooo07: i will forever be a classic andy
[0:49:31] Boneyards_666: i found it easy all i did was pvp
[0:49:31] Niksen_99: In the beginning you had to farm rares for gear.. It was bad
[0:49:31] AlfredDLoW: yes rare elite farm was so stupid
[0:49:35] Kazay1998: I feel like a hamster playing retail now
[0:49:35] Syloa: COPIUM
[0:49:39] Kazay1998: I don't understand anyhing
[0:49:39] mordiell: tbh DF is quite tame
[0:49:42] mordiell: compared to like SL
[0:49:42] mlady_telegramz97: with war within maybe stuff will get better
[0:49:44] meatbe4t: POE2 pog
[0:49:44] Valvax: not even close
[0:49:45] mlady_telegramz97: COPIUM
[0:49:49] geennaamnl1: If I need a spreadsheet to play a game IM OUT
[0:49:50] Ewriick: Or they just watch Kripp
[0:49:51] BALtaram: the system seems complicated at first, but it's simple when you look into it
[0:49:52] CollinPCO: just do it
[0:49:56] Valvax: poe shits on wow baseg
[0:49:57] maxwell_rs3: thats me !
[0:49:57] Mr_Moffert: Okayge ive never made my own build in POE
[0:49:58] Syloa: !poe
[0:50:02] thedirtbagel: Just follow the icy veins guide lol
[0:50:02] eskilator_gl: Zizaran makes great guides YEP
[0:50:02] CALOT_ROGUE: @geennaamnl1 lol
[0:50:05] bepn: go check out the weak auras needed for mythic echo of nelth… it’s wild
[0:50:12] Kazay1998: @Mr_Moffert What is POE? Clueless
[0:50:15] imdeazyz: m+ is bad
[0:50:20] Vharc: just do +18 keys lol
[0:50:24] medanmarko: @Kazay1998 The best ARPG on the market atm.
[0:50:26] sauceboifredo: wait too many buttons, can’t compete without addons and weakauras, the game is really overwhelming that’s why people play SoD and classic the game is not how it used to be they should make it very dumbed down and make it for console and it would be fun nobody wants to remember 50 buttons and the keybind them for 3 different classes it’s annoying .. #Goodtake
[0:50:28] ooTHExTUBEoo: What is the point of having damage scaling to MILLIONS? When the numbers get so high it feels less satisfying and impactful. We need a new squish.
[0:50:28] mlady_telegramz97: yeah Mythic plus is ASS
[0:50:36] mlady_telegramz97: I say that as a retail enjoeyrt
[0:50:39] mikeisher87: LUL
[0:50:39] mordiell: @imdeazyz i would argue its the best content in any wow expansion
[0:50:40] mlady_telegramz97: enjoyer*
[0:50:41] zorpotv: M+ is made for noobs to feel like theyre accomplishing something
[0:50:43] CALOT_ROGUE: Retail is over saturated with crap
[0:50:44] Vharc: but groups wont event you to a group because your M+ rating is 0
[0:50:45] imdeazyz: bring back challenge mode
[0:50:45] Syloa: retail feels way more of a spreadsheet game. less like an actual game
[0:50:46] handovdoom666: google sheets is free tho
[0:50:49] Ewriick: HACKERMANS shut up mom, im playing excel
[0:50:58] Smooo07: simple
[0:50:58] Trexbo_: Way too many buttons, just play a simple class om
[0:50:58] Hansen_: This guy makes it so more confusing that it is there is no need for this spreadsheet wtf
[0:50:59] Smooo07: yea
[0:51:00] LA7ARUS_: lool yeah good luck getting into +18s when you take breaks throughout the expansion
[0:51:02] mlady_telegramz97: @ewriick om
[0:51:07] Smooo07: om
[0:51:07] CamGG__: M+ pugs are miserable, 1 death someone leaves and your key is bricked.
[0:51:08] Trexbo_: Frost DK obliterate spec is simple af
[0:51:09] Kazay1998: @Ewriick alowo
[0:51:09] Zoqhan: DF is simple man, get better KAPPA
[0:51:11] specialkidmiles: @imdeazyz M+ is probably awesome with a group of friends, but if you are solo bolo it's rough
[0:51:12] CALOT_ROGUE: There is no balance in Retail in terms of the flow of the game.
[0:51:12] Boneyards_666: $fl Ewriick
[0:51:12] Supibot: boneyards_666, That user's first message in this channel was (2y, 295d ago): kakiotREE kakiotREE kakiotREE kakiotREE

[0:51:19] jakethesnake112: true
[0:51:20] mlady_telegramz97: one button macros man
[0:51:20] Ewriick: Kazay1998 ALOO
[0:51:20] zebrakissen: what is this take
[0:51:21] mlady_telegramz97: omE
[0:51:21] danlb100: if I need a spreadsheet I’m not playing it - give me classic / HC
[0:51:22] meatbe4t: dont compare to PIkaboo... he'S a god amongst men
[0:51:23] medanmarko: I don't want simple! I want differential equations before I even log in!

[0:51:52] The_Crane: CSGO is so easy to watch for a noob
[0:51:52] kompany111: venruki and pika just blow my mind every arena
[0:51:53] smcauli1: But that is because you dont play retail
[0:51:54] SillyPanda: thats the reason the AWC has been hardcapped on viewership for 10 years

[0:52:45] Smooo07: guzu what do you say about a pre nerfed revolver
[0:52:46] eskilator_gl: Gun shoots people they die. In wow they have 16 cheat death effects and people have 0 idea what a good play is.

[0:53:25] kryhuan: DUCK ON YOU
[0:53:26] Ewriick: @Trexbo_ let me know when CS:GO has different classes, talent builds, a bunch of gear slots and balance patches om
[0:53:27] SillyPanda: I will defend retail here. The upgrade system is actually very simple, just looks complicated
[0:53:30] mordiell: ? thats a dumb take
[0:53:38] mordiell: everyone asks you to ahve WA for ICC
[0:53:41] mlady_telegramz97: Thats a weird take tho
[0:53:42] HeadShot794: i never used weak auras om
[0:53:43] zorpotv: @SillyPanda its easy to put in a youtube and make look bad
[0:53:48] crazykman290: i have more raidaddons for classic than i do in retail
[0:53:50] sl1nky1981: Yeah, he's making this sound WAY more complicated than it actually is
[0:53:55] Boneyards_666: i dont use weak auras
[0:53:59] crazykman290: dbm = good to go in retail
[0:53:59] Kazay1998: oh my
[0:54:01] zorpotv: @sl1nky1981 its called clickbait
[0:54:03] SirNovrak: feels like retail is taking a step back in term of difficulty, amirdrasil is easy and kinda fun
[0:54:06] mlady_telegramz97: you don’t need weakauras to have to do retail mechanics
[0:54:07] mlady_telegramz97: Thats bait
[0:54:09] andros299: KEKW RETAIL WAs
[0:54:13] Kazay1998: I like my classic
[0:54:13] MeowgicTheCathering: weakaura arms race Aware
[0:54:16] zebrakissen: good thing we are basing this on the 0.1% of wow players
[0:54:24] 3Brick_: peepoRiot Ban all addons except Questie
[0:54:25] BALtaram: vanilla raid UI is simple to follow aswell
[0:54:26] iugad: 100%
[0:54:26] sl1nky1981: @zorpotv Yup, you're 100% right
[0:54:27] tr_bluer: those wa are used by 0.1% of ppl, the extreme ones
[0:54:27] Parshce: yeah weakauras aren’t a must
[0:54:27] Dabufy: retail mechanics is a ramdom timing
[0:54:28] Vertigo_GB: for mythic ... ye right
[0:54:32] mordiell: people use WA in every version of wow
[0:54:33] Curtsy: @SirNovrak what are you even talking about, the most revent raid on mythic has been one of the hardest in ages KEKW
[0:54:34] LeWayneey: highest difficulty you definitly need them
[0:54:46] br0fest0r: Its a cyle: hard mechanics -> addons to deal with them -> harder mechanics because there's addons -> ...
[0:54:55] Curtsy: Not probably, yes you do period
[0:54:56] bl1nk_1298: yeah try finishing mythic without WA, see how long your guild keeps you around lmao
[0:54:56] mimic124: why are they fighting deathwing again
[0:54:59] SirNovrak: @Curtsy previous seasons yes, but season 3 was a joke compared KEKW
[0:55:01] noxthentus: Honestly, id just say let blizz remove addons completely
[0:55:06] nsoriano13: Do you play retail anymore? @Guzu
[0:55:07] Murkyx: they make the encounters for the addons
[0:55:07] jimbonni: never us it on HC
[0:55:07] Hansen_: @noxthentus HUH
[0:55:10] Horfent: Atleast retail has difficulty Guzu
[0:55:11] Zataes: the raids are so stupidely over-designed that without WAs you don't even know anymore whats happening, at least for mythic raids towards the end
[0:55:11] Parshce: I found you didn’t need them in heroic, but that was back in BfA
[0:55:15] geennaamnl1: Well im gonna play retail today , im opening 42 spreadsheets now im downloading 831 weak aura's , I think im ready for retail now .
[0:55:17] zorpotv: i don't understand why it's a problem to not understand high level arenas without experience.... otherwise it wouldn't be high level lmao
[0:55:21] VinnieK_: dbm/bigwigs is enough for heroic
[0:55:24] Hansen_: atleast retail is by far more difficult than classic XD
[0:55:24] Curtsy: If you roll up to a guild doing M prog and say you wont use addons youll just be put on ignore
[0:55:29] NeverKrowsBest: hi
[0:55:30] mlady_telegramz97: so almost 1 year
[0:55:30] bepn: echo of nelth mythic weak auras was a boss b4 the boss.  100% needed and so trash
[0:55:37] sauceboifredo: ban all macros, and addons and let’s see how good people actually are at the game you’ll be crying for blizzard to make it easier and less complicated you can’t step foot in a raid or arena or rbg without a stupid addon telling you when your cooldowns are ready and who to dispel ..
[0:55:37] mlady_telegramz97: KEKW
[0:55:38] Mr_Moffert: eatt
[0:55:48] grubols: chat is it hard to understand stand a dunk?
[0:55:49] Ckraigfriend: pvp people use the most addons but they dont want to addmit
[0:55:51] ooTHExTUBEoo: luhmao
[0:55:54] Niksen_99: Damn people are really passionate about this subject KEKW
[0:55:55] mordiell: in retail? oh there are , you would be surprised
[0:55:57] Hunter__Thie: @Hansen_ classic -> press w and 2 skill rotations haha
[0:55:58] allgoody: it is to hard for new ppl to understand compared to other esports games
[0:56:00] mordiell: they just dont do high end stuff
[0:56:16] Trexbo_: @Ewriick Shruge My point was you cant exactly compare different game genres because they have their own balancing, mechanics, and so on. I meant that from a new players POV you might not understand why a pro player knows exactly where another player is based on whatever information he has, previous knowledge, sound cues, so on. And when it comes to guns too there are multiple pistols, ARs, Shotguns, so on. Which one is better than the other? What combination of pistol and main gun should you go?
[0:56:16] mlady_telegramz97: WAYTOODANK
[0:56:19] geennaamnl1: Well im gonna play retail today , im opening 42 spreadsheets now im downloading 831 weak aura's , I think im ready for retail now LUL
[0:56:21] Smooo07: Oldge
[0:56:22] SillyPanda: I think that's an issue with the UI more than the content. (minus mythic raiding)
[0:56:24] Trexbo_: Holy wall of text om
[0:56:28] 3Brick_: Oldge i am 21
[0:56:30] CALOT_ROGUE: 10 button rotations is stupid for the masses
[0:56:32] sauceboifredo: yo brb gotta download 100 addons quick
[0:56:32] mlady_telegramz97: OM
[0:56:32] Syloa: YEP
[0:56:37] stunn4: spectating an arena match do u look at the character or the action bar which buttons get pressed?
[0:56:37] sauceboifredo: and look up 10 macros
[0:56:40] Smooo07: theres so much stuff on the screen i dont like it WAYTOODANK
[0:56:43] tw1ZTER: on mythic? Hmm
[0:56:43] Nikoftz27: yea we saw that yesterday omE
[0:56:43] saren_x: I'm too old to play well so the game is bad Oldge
[0:56:45] sauceboifredo: and then figure out which key to bind
[0:56:46] grizzlyhead: Streamer syndrome EZ Clap
[0:56:46] Hansen_: u cant
[0:56:48] Hansen_: xd
[0:56:48] Curtsy: cant actually do that in m prog though
[0:56:51] lord_windir: Too many? KEKW
[0:56:51] Zoqhan: casuel players can just play without addons, you dont need anything addons, but when u want to do more stuff ingame, like mythic+ or raid, you need to get them and wacth videos how to play, thats how it is, same in classic players now.. if ppl start in classic you dont need addons, but when u go for dungs and raid you need read up tacs and how to play, and get some addons... its same shit both ways.
[0:56:56] Smooo07: the simplicity of classic was always the best to me peepoHappy
[0:57:00] mlady_telegramz97: @smooo07 you haven’t seen my retail raid WAYTOODANK
[0:57:05] mlady_telegramz97: @smooo07 its much worse
[0:57:05] mordiell: raiding is boring
[0:57:10] geennaamnl1: @sauceboifredo Dont forget to download the 41 spreadsheets + 873 weak aura's otherwise u cant play it
[0:57:10] Boneyards_666: ^
[0:57:11] zebrakissen: not like we had this in the first raid ever aswell
[0:57:12] Zerfell: based take
[0:57:16] Smooo07: @mlady_telegramz97 i dont wanna see it WAYTOODANK
[0:57:24] zorpotv: the thing is, raiding isn't a requirement to play the game and there's other stuff to do
[0:57:24] Jeff_dd: i feel like this guy made a video for casuals about hardcore players
[0:57:25] twitchforgotmyaccount: Hard raids are opt-in, no? You have to be max level to raid, and even then there's LFR
[0:57:29] tw1ZTER: we need a chatwar emote
[0:57:32] Curtsy: @Zoqhan casual players still use addons, popular addons have millions of downloads, you think those are all min max people?
[0:57:42] RANDAYMAGNUM: i <3 raiding only reason i play retail
[0:57:47] sauceboifredo: hold on I still need the 1 shot macro and target macros
[0:57:48] DemiG4: HeyGuys HeyGuys HeyGuys
[0:57:51] mordiell: RANDAYMAGNUM peepoHug
[0:57:51] Trexbo_: Yeah I mean Heroic and Mythic REQUIRES efficiency, but LFR or Normal doesn't, just do what you want and learn? shruge
[0:57:51] mlady_telegramz97: @smooo07 CLICK ALL YOUR COOLDOWNS USE ICEBLOCK ON COOLDOWN INSTANTLY CLICK HEROISM WAYTOODANK
[0:57:52] sauceboifredo: and my 58 addons
[0:57:54] macjcool: I stopped raiding becuase i cant keep up with the 512 button rotation like a hyper zoomer
[0:57:54] Trexbo_: Shruge
[0:57:55] nostalgiatrip94: @guzu hey guy, resident evil 4 chapter today?
[0:58:01] mlady_telegramz97: @smooo07 Thats why I quit retail raiding
[0:58:02] SillyPanda: True
[0:58:03] Vertigo_GB: compare mechanics of vanilla raids vs retail ... its 10x
[0:58:04] Curtsy: Retail raids sometimes have more mechanics in one boss than all of classic has in all raids
[0:58:08] Syloa: 2nd Clueless
[0:58:11] sauceboifredo: retail is garbage
[0:58:14] Trexbo_: Like higher ranks in CS:GO Stare Guzu
[0:58:15] Branura: i feel like there are to many different currencies in an expansion
[0:58:19] henrikbc98: Also the case in classic that one player can wipe the entire raid because of doing the mechanic wrong
[0:58:19] imdeazyz: i just started WOTLK and I love it
[0:58:23] Trexbo_: fricc
[0:58:24] Zoqhan: @Curtsy you dont need addons to play casual wow ingame, only when you want to go higher, like keys or raid..
[0:58:24] zorpotv: @Curtsy someone never played WOTLK
[0:58:24] SillyPanda: And theres a reason games like fortnite are so popular with kids. Drop, die, insta drop back in
[0:58:26] Trexbo_: YES
[0:58:27] Niksen_99: KEKW
[0:58:27] mlady_telegramz97: fricc
[0:58:28] Trexbo_: RAGEY
[0:58:30] Syloa: om
[0:58:31] sauceboifredo: best thing blizzard could do is release a console version and it would do super numbers
[0:58:33] RANDAYMAGNUM: @mordiell  catKISS
[0:58:33] jakethesnake112: csgo is different because everyone cheats
[0:58:38] mlady_telegramz97: RAGEU
[0:58:40] MADcefa: YEP
[0:58:40] mlady_telegramz97: RAGEY
[0:58:43] sauceboifredo: with like 20 buttons max for console
[0:58:44] smithers0351: angy
[0:58:45] Trexbo_: ITS NOT AS CONFUSING SURE, BUT YOU CANT COMPARE TWO DIFFERENT GENRES
[0:58:45] mordiell: idk man in a day and age where people want to do few fast fun games and go about their day, raiding seems like the worst thing ever LUL progressing on one boss for hours nothing changing guzuSleepo
[0:58:47] mikeisher87: KEKW
[0:58:49] Curtsy: @zorpotv I'm talking about actual real classic, wotlk is retail lite
[0:58:51] Peoplewhinetoomuch: Also retail has so much hidden scaling its insane. Sometimes a gear uograde might be a downgrade because of some scaling shit
[0:58:51] buttmcgeee: OneGuy
[0:58:53] mlady_telegramz97: WAYTOODANK
[0:58:55] Jeff_dd: get their hp bar to 0

[0:59:00] Velonna: two teams of three, with magics, good luck
[0:59:01] Trexbo_: ?????? 3v3 IS 6 PEOPLE SLAMMING EACH OTHER ???????
[0:59:03] bl1nk_1298: CSGO and other tac shooters have a VERY low barrier to entry, but the max level gameplay is far more confusing than a WoW type game
[0:59:04] Vharc: 3v3 arena - two teams using their best spells at eachother
[0:59:05] mlady_telegramz97: PepeLa
[0:59:05] Seline88: no way how did you do it?
[0:59:06] Daftducky: I was watching Ziqo earlier and I had no idea what was going on
[0:59:06] Lappi_Koski: Trexbo_ why dont you spam some pogchamps in the chat instead
[0:59:06] toooth: @mordiell doing raids once or twice to beat normal or heroic is ideal for me Danki
[0:59:06] smithers0351: keking
[0:59:07] Syloa: ???? cant compare things that are different is my favorite INSANE take om
[0:59:09] Vertigo_GB: there is a reason competitive wow is basically dead
[0:59:12] andros299: CS is just straight forward what you have to do mr Guzu
[0:59:14] CamGG__: 10hr react today this is going well
[0:59:15] Nikoftz27: just stop talking Guzu its not worth omE
[0:59:16] Smooo07: the store i went to didnt have the ramen noodles i wanted and the car wash was packed with people peepoAngy

[0:59:25] nsoriano13: Hey Guzu! I just bought my 3rd PC from StarForge Systems. I told Asmon it was because of you @Guzu
[0:59:27] Nikoftz27: Smooo07, peepoAngy

[0:59:39] Smooo07: oooooooooh
[0:59:39] Curtsy: @Vertigo_GB If you mean PvP it's because people are using trigger progs and nobody wants to play against that, its a mess
[0:59:39] sauceboifredo: WoW on console is the next great thing that may never happen
[0:59:40] allgoody: yup
[0:59:41] stunn4: like football
[0:59:41] maxwell_rs3: dont confuse difference between a noob and pro , we talk about understanding the basic of the game
[0:59:42] Gangrod: its like watching boxing or football
[0:59:42] mordiell: @toooth yea, thats okay, but people progress this for months, being stuck on one boss for weeks.. its a little too much LUL
[0:59:43] grizzlyhead: Dentge yep
[0:59:45] 4mecha: OneGuy
[0:59:45] Syzmical: Shooters are braindeadge not a new crazy take
[0:59:50] Vorpalwarp: theres nuance to CS such as Econ rounds etc but its nothing compared to retail WoW
[0:59:50] Boneyards_666: OneGuy

[0:59:51] mlady_telegramz97: oh my what is this Dentge
[0:59:51] jakethesnake112: the problem with watching CS is the constant camera changes. it throws new viewers off

[1:00:01] Arakkis2: YOU HAVE ANGERED ME
[1:00:02] tw1ZTER: is this the usual retail vs classic war?
[1:00:03] Trexbo_: I dont get it
[1:00:09] zebrakissen: ok i can agree that some affixes are straight up trash
[1:00:09] itsadam56: csgo you just have to aimbot to win like everyone else EZ
[1:00:11] theslothyone: explain why gingi won? he is gingi, easy :D joking though, i get the point
[1:00:12] sauceboifredo: omg I can watch 10000 hours of arenas and still not figure out anything

[1:00:46] mordiell: so this guy doesnt want to play the game
[1:00:46] mordiell: OM
[1:00:49] Blufootgaming: TRUE
[1:00:50] SillyPanda: @Trexbo_ WoW-what buttons did they press? CS- they left clicked first
[1:00:54] Curtsy: @tr_bluer this is not dalaran lol
[1:00:54] malefic918: Right like whats he on about
[1:00:55] sauceboifredo: I’m gonna cheap shot you’re gonna sheep
[1:00:57] Teddyhowdy: that guy just want to play in LFR level or what
[1:00:57] thedirtbagel: Affix is how you scale for expirenced players
[1:00:59] Elijahss: he is tripping
[1:01:00] Blufootgaming: the stat affixes suck, but the other ones are cool
[1:01:00] Motoclash: affix is just pain
[1:01:00] aggr0crag32: @TrueNosus I think it's to show your global cooldown
[1:01:01] sauceboifredo: watch drs
[1:01:02] Jeff_dd: @mordiell pretty much KEKW
[1:01:02] branz_bs: gz on SM ma man <3
[1:01:02] ykasonni87: ???
[1:01:03] Hansen_: THSI GUYS IS ON CRACK
[1:01:03] Ewriick: @mordiell i mean thats any wow player, ever
[1:01:03] EnyoHC: managing affixes is skill related yeh
[1:01:05] Trexbo_: @SillyPanda But it's not that simple
[1:01:05] sauceboifredo: lol
[1:01:09] Niksen_99: There are some affixes that are just dumb tho
[1:01:10] EnyoHC: His vids are always kind of on the edge ngl
[1:01:10] sauceboifredo: stupid retail
[1:01:11] Vertigo_GB: raider io is a bigger issue for me from m+ pov
[1:01:11] Ckraigfriend: thats like not kicking in pvp whne someone its casting
[1:01:11] justice7717: i think wow has other problems complexity usually shouldnt be an issue otherwise "games" like chess wouldnt have any players either its fine not to understand the game at a first glance but it just severely lacks in other areas
[1:01:13] zebrakissen: on death affixes are so toxic
[1:01:15] Smooo07: guzu would you say wow or league competitive is harder to understand?
[1:01:15] Vorpalwarp: He wants classic wow dungeons in retail
[1:01:16] Nikoftz27: YEA WE COULD SEE THAT WITH YOU EXPLODING GHOST YESTERDAY omE
[1:01:22] Sugu1412: Mythic + is great
[1:01:22] giantbuckethead: GOD FORBID YOU CHANGE YOUR BUILD TO BEAT SOMETHING
[1:01:22] BALtaram: he has a hate relationship with the game OM
[1:01:22] TrueNosus: @aggr0crag32 ahhhhhhhh okay LMAO ill take the L
[1:01:25] COVHNWKO_8_KAPMAWKE: I think that the whole concept of mmorpg is so old. All the mechanics with lvls, rep or whatever you should grind is a relic from the past, but the devs don't want to design new things.
[1:01:25] grylz89: I liken retail raiding to synchronized swimming while doing a perfect rotation hahah
[1:01:26] Horfent: The affixes are what kills m+ for me, id love to do the dungeons with just higher number man
[1:01:27] thedirtbagel: Boo hood lol
[1:01:28] tr_bluer: @Curtsy he is
[1:01:28] Zoqhan: CSgo, you can just go in and play, if u want to do comp and get ranks, u have to learn spots and guns and what to do.. same as wow, casuel players dont need to have addons or read shit to play, but if u want to push keys or do high raid, u have to read up what to do, and have addons to play. its the same @Guzu
[1:01:29] sl1nky1981: Yeah, IMO, this video is just a bunch of over-generalized bad takes
[1:01:31] tw1ZTER: what snapshot lol
[1:01:31] Boneyards_666: om
[1:01:34] Niksen_99: But CSGO guzu
[1:01:34] SillyPanda: @Trexbo_ Dude I have 4k hours in CS and 10k+ in WoW. You're wrong xD its exactly that simple and thats why CS has so much more viewership than WoW esports
[1:01:35] grizzlyhead: Gimp? gachiHYPER
[1:01:37] Elijahss: Storming was too much but besides that....
[1:01:37] Boneyards_666: this guy has bad takes
[1:01:37] Hansen_: THIS GUY IS A ROLEPLAER HAHAHA
[1:01:38] giantbuckethead: This part is ridiculous
[1:01:39] HeadShot794: smh Man's cooked
[1:01:39] Pweefy1: this dudes take about affixes is dumb
[1:01:42] mordiell: this man wants a classic raid/dungeon, stand in one place and pump
[1:01:42] Durenas: the tornadoes are dumb, the terrain doesn't always give you the freedom to avoid them
[1:01:43] ritter184: Unless your a meta chaser in which case you don't handle it with your kit but instead swap to a different class that handles it more effectively
[1:01:44] baak: Roll fury warrior ahah no need to do anything but dmg
[1:01:45] Carlt0n_B4nks: without affixes what reason is there for different teams?
[1:01:47] kisamabuti: too many flashing colors on screen. its like motel hell. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2Lt0Ek64eM
[1:01:48] SirNovrak: let's just say there's a massive reason that we now have +20 dungeons instead of normal mythic :)
[1:01:51] lord_windir: l2p
[1:01:52] giantbuckethead: LOL WTF
[1:01:53] piperboi: Do i have to take off my dmf buff to get a new?
[1:01:53] geennaamnl1: I have no idea whats going on right now guzu
[1:01:53] Mr_Moffert: sitt just attack the target dummies
[1:01:53] Curtsy: @tr_bluer I think you need your hearing checked my dude, this is Marcellian
[1:01:56] tr_bluer: @Curtsy nvm he sounds the same and has same shit takes mb
[1:01:58] thedirtbagel: Go watch gingi do a mythic key lol
[1:01:58] Almiller1818: Just play better YEP
[1:01:59] mordiell: this man wants a classic raid/dungeon, stand in one place and pump
[1:02:00] eskilator_gl: God of War om
[1:02:00] Elijahss: He is a casual
[1:02:01] lorzy91: this guy is suck a dweeb
[1:02:02] Ckraigfriend: this is a clickbait video he dosent think that he is just baitng new players who cry all the time
[1:02:04] Chrisfo79: So this guy just wants to pump with no mechanics? Sounds boring to me
[1:02:06] lord_windir: Just kill it
[1:02:08] grylz89: @guzu I liken retail raiding to synchronized swimming while doing a perfect rotation hahah
[1:02:11] Motoclash: some affixes just suck balls
[1:02:15] sauceboifredo: yo bro you got the new weak aura and 1 shot macro you got the new cheap shot with sheep and root
[1:02:17] Valvax: i fucking hate affixes, i actively avoid weeks with certain affixes
[1:02:18] Vharc: bolstering is dogshit
[1:02:22] sauceboifredo: how silly do I sound
[1:02:23] RANDAYMAGNUM: @lorzy91  glol
[1:02:26] sauceboifredo: stupid af
[1:02:28] BALtaram: season 3 atm is the most forgiving out of all in DF OM
[1:02:29] specialkidmiles: there's a whole movement of people saying affixes should be removed and keys should just ramp up in difficulty with health and damage
[1:02:29] bigb0omer: dragonflight bad
[1:02:30] Ewriick: @COVHNWKO_8_KAPMAWKE "I think that the whole concept of FPS is so old". It's a genre, at some point someone comes up with something new, but MMORPG will still be around. Just like any old music genre.
[1:02:33] giantbuckethead: "Just let me run over the content plz"
[1:02:35] sayjaki: @Guzu It sounds like he just wants target dummies.
[1:02:37] SillyPanda: This guy just wants to stand and hit for 20 years
[1:02:41] Pweefy1: lmao afflicted and incorp are braindead affixes
[1:02:41] saren_x: just play the easier difficulty then Weirdge
[1:02:43] mordiell: @sayjaki pretty much
[1:02:44] zebrakissen: bolstering is not fine
[1:02:44] lorzy91: lol
[1:02:48] Ckraigfriend: if you only wanna do damage go lfd not mythic plus then
[1:02:49] Branura: bursting fine?
[1:02:50] tw1ZTER: stop dispelling catYep
[1:02:55] SirNovrak: maybe go out and touch grass the weeks you don't like the affixes forsenWiggle
[1:02:57] lorzy91: does tthis guy even play retail...
[1:03:01] Elijahss: Only season 1 was half way an issue, I still got key master pugging
[1:03:02] Carlt0n_B4nks: should have taken dps that can dispell lol
[1:03:03] Chipi_qc: But isn't mythic plus purposefuly difficult for those who wants a challenge?
[1:03:04] Zoqhan: CSgo, you can just go in and play, if u want to do comp and get ranks, u have to learn spots and guns and what to do.. same as wow, casuel players dont need to have addons or read shit to play, but if u want to push keys or do high raid, u have to read up what to do, and have addons to play. its the same @Guzu
[1:03:05] Hansen_: he is on druygs..
[1:03:08] Raitox92: He prefers bursting over dispelling a mob? Alright, heard enough
[1:03:10] Trexbo_: @SillyPanda I think CS:GO has more viewership because the game genre is more popular Shruge But yeah I guess one game genre is "simpler" than another.
[1:03:11] Pweefy1: this dude struggles on 15s
[1:03:11] mordiell: OM idk about this guy's videos...
[1:03:12] Nicholas909: HUH
[1:03:15] buttmcgeee: @Guzu can you do this irl guguPotJAM
[1:03:15] Nikoftz27: Smooo07, PepeNPC ITS YOUR KEY
[1:03:16] tw1ZTER: m+ on classic VeryPog
[1:03:16] Boneyards_666: yeah if they remove mechanics from stuff we would never get to see guzu pumping and then insta floor gang guzuSleepo guzuSleepo guzuSleepo  guzuGiggle guzuGiggle
[1:03:17] BALtaram: many classes have dispels
[1:03:20] thedirtbagel: This guy wants a participation award lol
[1:03:20] lord_windir: ???????
[1:03:20] Ewriick: interacting
[1:03:20] Trexbo_: interacting
[1:03:22] Huertix: Iread like this
[1:03:23] imdeazyz: agagsyahahahzjdjs
[1:03:23] Valvax: the flame shock deals 30% of your dmg ever 2 seconds its unhealable lol
[1:03:24] batu_x96: its cringe
[1:03:25] giantbuckethead: @Guzu Are we seriously listening to a multi-minute rant on how this dude hates dispels?
[1:03:25] BALtaram: interacting
[1:03:25] Teddyhowdy: the thing is not only a healer probelm
[1:03:26] Gangrod: its like watching boxing or football
[1:03:26] sauceboifredo: yo bro sheep

[1:03:32] sauceboifredo: imma cheap shot
[1:03:33] Valvax: english huh
[1:03:35] br0fest0r: Idk, thats a lukewarm take on M+ . Having annoying shit do deal with while also pushing the limits to clear the dungeon is literally what M+ is about.
[1:03:37] sauceboifredo: I got mind games
[1:03:38] Curtsy: Yeah I was agreeing with him about retail currency but now he's just complaining about the fundamentals of ,+
[1:03:38] evildufus: He needs to git gud
[1:03:40] sauceboifredo: dispel me
[1:03:40] Huertix: interacting
[1:03:41] Syzmical: the scaling would make that hard alone, without affixes
[1:03:41] Zoqhan: no its not
[1:03:43] grizzlyhead: ONE GUIDE LULW
[1:03:43] Niksen_99: Sanguine guzuY
[1:03:44] Curtsy: yes guzu is right
[1:03:46] macjcool: too many damn spells
[1:03:48] jakethesnake112: retail is too hard. just let me afk auto attack my 40 man raid bosses and have fun
[1:03:49] Moogrins: its a matter of opinion, some may not agree, move on
[1:03:52] Guzumerchmanager: @Zoqhan yes it is wtf u on about
[1:03:53] Nunadaaa: very very very much so lol
[1:03:53] Syloa: at least at the basis of whats happening, some tactical stuff might not be obvious
[1:03:56] sunmantv: easier to spectate, harder to play
[1:03:58] Houtss: WoW arean breaks my head brain and ive been playing since 2006 lol
[1:04:00] thedirtbagel: It's easy to pickup on what is happening, hard to understand the nuance and skill involved
[1:04:00] Mr_Moffert: you really cant argue that wow arena is a good spectator esport
[1:04:03] Gangrod: its like watching boxing or football
[1:04:05] Sugu1412: OneGuy OneGuy OneGuy OneGuy
[1:04:05] kallebalik: yeah, that is the beauty of CS :)
[1:04:06] meatbe4t: 100%
[1:04:07] maxwell_rs3: too many spells in cs
[1:04:07] mlady_telegramz97: SPELLSTEAL DISPELL DECURSE TRINKET BURST WAYTOODANK
[1:04:08] Curtsy: csgo at a base level is shoot gun = win
[1:04:10] emedde: Idk how it's now but I remember in my days some days you don't push cause affixes was really annoying, that's a shit
[1:04:10] mlady_telegramz97: so much stuff
[1:04:10] Niksen_99: Cdew see like 20 moves ahead
[1:04:11] ritter184: People can relate to getting shot, people can't relate to particle vomit
[1:04:12] Zoqhan: if u want to pvp, you read up the shit, same as CS LUL
[1:04:13] mlady_telegramz97: in ranked arena
[1:04:16] sauceboifredo: wow arena makes you feel slow
[1:04:17] ptuq: Cs stream when?
[1:04:17] SloppyStream_: watching ICC loses me lol
[1:04:17] Teddyhowdy: just compare Voice call in cs and Arena 3s
[1:04:18] SillyPanda: @Mr_Moffert it is if you just shut your brain off and watch hp bars xD
[1:04:18] Trexbo_: iAsk How about we compare MMO to MMO?
[1:04:18] Guzumerchmanager: sure u dont understand all the small details and strats but its easier to see what is happening on the screen @Zoqhan
[1:04:22] aBleckfisk: classic fighting games like street fighter has the same thing as CS in your take. I completely agree. it’s clear and straight forward
[1:04:23] haze__man: arena is one of shitiest things to watch
[1:04:23] Elijahss: Idk about that
[1:04:27] BigeNoodle: Even WoW doesn't know where damage is coming from KEKW
[1:04:32] sauceboifredo: nobody in this comment will ever break 1600 bracket
[1:04:36] Ewriick: @haze__man arena Bedge
[1:04:41] 3Brick_: docnotL Frick this there is to much friction in this chat
[1:04:44] mlady_telegramz97: decurse simulator
[1:04:46] aggr0crag32: @sauceboifredo so, you?
[1:04:47] sauceboifredo: you have no idea what is going on in arena
[1:04:47] zebrakissen: ???
[1:04:48] mlady_telegramz97: om
[1:04:48] Elijahss: How is killing people in an arena not straight forward?
[1:04:53] Airt1: evokers are not mandatory lmao
[1:04:53] MeowgicTheCathering: everyone just shut up and kiss each other meandyouhorny
[1:04:56] Syzmical: pvp arena or bgs have never been good tho, not a new concept unfortunately
[1:04:56] sauceboifredo: anybody here lol
[1:04:58] Ckraigfriend: then dont invite thoes poeple
[1:04:59] sl1nky1981: Evoker's are not mandatory LOL
[1:05:01] BALtaram: wtf is his UI LOL
[1:05:06] COVHNWKO_8_KAPMAWKE: @Ewriick I'm just talking about the way you play the game. I love mmorpg, but it feels like the genre does not evolve at all. or it does in the strange direction.
[1:05:10] zebrakissen: my guy stuck in early season 2
[1:05:10] thedirtbagel: Naw, certain classes are OP on certain content, but never mandatory
[1:05:12] 3Brick_: peepoLeaveFinger Frick chat. Chat is not invited to the pizza party
[1:05:15] SirNovrak: this youtuber sound like he needs to make a game himself, he has the apparent critical thinking Kappa
[1:05:23] Vertigo_GB: but are they complicated?
[1:05:24] mlady_telegramz97: @3brick_ DD:
[1:05:25] Petrichorx_x: @MeowgicTheCathering peepoCute
[1:05:25] Exusprime: mmo mouse interface
[1:05:26] giantbuckethead: I have an idea, don't play the content you don't like to play?
[1:05:29] Durenas: timing 18's is pretty easy at the moment
[1:05:30] SpreadThemBootyCheeks: Morning cutie
[1:05:31] Curtsy: @Elijahss Because it's not, you have setups that take minutes long to do, your average person will just wonder why they're not bursting someone down right away
[1:05:37] Trexbo_: @Elijahss It's all about how you wanna simplify it om Like I mentioned earlier, the simplest explanation is: The team that won kept their HP above 0 and reduced the enemy team's HP to 0
[1:05:41] mlady_telegramz97: OH GOF
[1:05:44] Jeff_dd: this guy wannts to play minnensweeper
[1:05:45] twitchforgotmyaccount: @Elijahss In arenas, most of the complexity is right in your face. A new watcher isn't going to understand the meta in any game, but with WoW arenas, everyone has a ton of extremely important abilities and cooldowns coming off constantly.
[1:05:45] mlady_telegramz97: NOT MY CLADS
[1:05:47] mlady_telegramz97: PLEASE
[1:05:47] playerpersonx: "specs are getting better at being designed" Hmmge
[1:05:49] mlady_telegramz97: LET ME OUT
[1:05:51] mordiell: isnt this old
[1:05:53] Nicholas909: what the actual fuck
[1:05:53] Ewriick: @COVHNWKO_8_KAPMAWKE I personally think it's a bad take, but I understand what you mean. It's _very_ hard to reinvent something and make it good.
[1:05:54] BALtaram: not every class is like this tho OM
[1:05:56] Niksen_99: Gingi can do all that with eyes closed EZ
[1:06:00] SillyPanda: @mordiell yes lmao

[1:06:10] Blufootgaming: does this guy just want 1 button rotation
[1:06:11] Zoqhan: @Method_Quando if new in csgo and wacth, you dont know shit why the players go that why and look overther, but if u read up and learn the game, you know why pro player do that, same in pvp, at start you dont know shit and what happen on the sceen, but if u want to learn pvp or see it, you have to learn and read up what happen, LUL like its the same shit
[1:06:12] sauceboifredo: each class should have 12 buttons max and each spec should have its own spells and call it a day
[1:06:12] mlady_telegramz97: fricc arcane
[1:06:15] Elijahss: the dude should roll frost or fire....
[1:06:18] Niksen_99: ICANT
[1:06:18] COVHNWKO_8_KAPMAWKE: @Ewriick agree :)
[1:06:18] migashd: fury warrior is simple and fun
[1:06:19] MeowgicTheCathering: venthyr warriors GIGACHAD
[1:06:19] 3Brick_: LULW Warriors are easy
[1:06:20] SillyPanda: Imagine if they kept WoW as simple as classic for 20 years. This guy just doesn't like WoW anymore and thats ok dude play something else xD
[1:06:20] sl1nky1981: There are several classes that are pretty faceroll
[1:06:21] BALtaram: YEP same as fury warrior
[1:06:26] Syloa: and now you press sunder armor om
[1:06:26] Vertigo_GB: sounds fun
[1:06:27] imdeazyz: hahahahaha
[1:06:30] ninetysix: SL nathria was fire
[1:06:30] evildufus: LUL LUL LUL LUL
[1:06:32] Peoplewhinetoomuch: Venrukis video on retail pvp is the most accurate and true
[1:06:34] stunn4: how mayn times did u fck up ur rotation?
[1:06:34] BALtaram: fury warrior atm has 3 buttons to press om
[1:06:36] Durenas: I love ret paladin, it's a good rotation
[1:06:38] TrueNosus: i like classic wow rotations am i weird
[1:06:40] StreamElements: Sub to the IRL channel NOW! Madge https://www.youtube.com/@Guzu2
[1:06:42] ooTHExTUBEoo: Following a guide doesn't mean you understand the class. I've never followed a guide i've always topped dps
[1:06:46] SirNovrak: i don't understand the kids today, just try stuff out you don't need wowhead NotLikeThis
[1:06:48] Vertigo_GB: Why I like BM in retail
[1:06:48] mlady_telegramz97: I loved castle nathria mage tbh
[1:06:49] sl1nky1981: BM hunters have like...4 buttons to push, Demo lock is easy, Ret pally is easy, Fury....etc
[1:06:49] Niksen_99: I think its fine some specs are hard? BM hunter and Frost DK super simple
[1:06:51] Rixxey: I don't believe this is better
[1:07:01] Ckraigfriend: there is players who are still rank 1 without playing the META @Guzu
[1:07:02] sauceboifredo: Yes
[1:07:05] Swindledus: we need mmo's with only 5 button gameplay instead of 1000 buttons ok
[1:07:05] SillyPanda: If he thinks WoW has button bloat he should try ff14
[1:07:07] sauceboifredo: too many buttons
[1:07:09] Curtsy: retail rogue is pretty simple imo but the apm needed to play it well is too much for a lot of people
[1:07:10] StreamElements: Follow my Twitter, NOW! Madge https://www.twitter.com/guzuTV
[1:07:10] fertxunonimo: Spriest it's impossible to do the right rotation
[1:07:11] zoob32: Guzu remember VENDETTA ? guzuGiggle
[1:07:11] Phant0mBass: so much reacting 🙄🙄
[1:07:13] Rixxey: "we have to give them new stuff" but then they add a new class that fucks everything
[1:07:16] sauceboifredo: that do nothing for the spec
[1:07:16] toooth: @SirNovrak kids playing wow? OMEGALUL nah, only jaded boomers
[1:07:19] mlady_telegramz97: where is labyrinth when we need him
[1:07:21] mlady_telegramz97: hes monk
[1:07:22] thedirtbagel: 80 button minimum
[1:07:25] Trexbo_: But not every class or even spec is like this om
[1:07:28] 3Brick_: @Guzu fricc and i play a mage and i need to sheep get silenced on the frost tree now i gotta use Fire Tree then i need to DB Sheep and Ring of frost the healer. But warriors can just SMOrc my healer and i die
[1:07:29] MeowgicTheCathering: Chatting write the entirety of shakespeare's hamlet to cast fireball
[1:07:34] zebrakissen: @mlady_telegramz97 hes a mistweaver only I think
[1:07:35] Durenas: the less complex you make your rotation, the more attention you have to spare to deal with mechanics
[1:07:36] Hansen_: this guy should not play wow
[1:07:36] Rixxey: hate Outlaw lmfao

[1:11:49] crashyburnyMIT: does that matter? that you dont know where those numbers come from??
[1:11:50] playerpersonx: I like simming YEP
[1:11:58] Mr_Moffert: 5Head i run sims in real time in my brain
[1:11:59] sl1nky1981: Takes 5 minutes to sim LOL
[1:12:01] mimic124: quick sim Chatting
[1:12:04] Rixxey: every loot drop GOTTA SIM PepegaPls
[1:12:04] Trexbo_: I have never simmed in my life om
[1:12:06] SirNovrak: i like to taunt the bosses and they do not resist peepoEhm
[1:12:10] Curtsy: simming is only for a very small portion of people
[1:12:13] Trexbo_: YEP
[1:12:14] mlady_telegramz97: I have never summed honestly
[1:12:15] twitchforgotmyaccount: @crashyburnyMIT I can see why someone might think that, but then why are you playing a spec which has that as its specific theme OM
[1:12:15] meatbe4t: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RlLl6bBq584
[1:12:16] RANDAYMAGNUM: just play healer never sim xD
[1:12:17] Trexbo_: YEP Exactly
[1:12:18] JoYneX: you don't have to do 24 keys if you don't want to..
[1:12:18] mlady_telegramz97: simmed*
[1:12:22] its_me_: simming is for minamxers to get 1% more dps
[1:12:22] Rahmulous: You definitely don’t. the vast vast majority aren’t pushing Mythic raid progression.
[1:12:23] ayahuana: Yeah but then u press your big button on classic and it misses, having to get a hitcap is so fun..
[1:12:24] Ewriick: The fact that sims are needed says a lot
[1:12:27] crazykman290: basically trinkets are the only thing you need to sim and even then theres already data out there on it
[1:12:28] lolpetje: how did I ever pllay wow never did any of this damm
[1:12:28] Ewriick: well, "nneeded"
[1:12:30] mackh2012: 95% of the time its just equip the higher ilvl anyway
[1:12:30] Curtsy: its good for a very very small amount of people
[1:12:30] surpriseparty20: Unless u wanna raid mythic there is no reason to sim .
[1:12:32] Ckraigfriend: yeah you dont need simming
[1:12:35] Arlique246: how do you know without simming if a trinket is good for you? haha.
[1:12:35] Mynester: Hi Guzu peepoEhm
[1:12:36] mlady_telegramz97: true
[1:12:39] Mynester: Daily peepoEhm 󠀀
[1:12:41] SillyPanda: This is more a community issue where they think they have to act like mythic raiders in their +5
[1:12:41] lorzy91: you really dont
[1:12:42] biki2112: you cant stack to stats because of dr
[1:12:42] JoYneX: sure you need basic math
[1:12:43] kisamabuti: you do if you don’t want to be yelled at and kicked.
[1:12:47] specialkidmiles: you don't have to be good, you can be bad 4Head
[1:12:49] Syloa: need to sim adding the numbers YEP
[1:12:49] ayahuana: Was talking about his previous point tho
[1:12:49] lorzy91: he is stretching it so far...
[1:12:52] SirNovrak: where did you get these numbers from?
[1:12:52] Trexbo_: YEP I kinda hate how he overexaggerates these points to support his overall argument.
[1:12:56] JoYneX: but simming is the same thing.. but you simply cannot do the math in your mind
[1:12:58] lorzy91: ppl sim more in wotllk
[1:13:00] Rixxey: diff discussion but I don't like miss as a mechanic
[1:13:03] kisamabuti: people in wow can be real assholes.
[1:13:04] MeowgicTheCathering: this isnt a problem with wow, its a problem with gaming in general
[1:13:04] its_me_: 7
[1:13:05] Smooo07: wtf
[1:13:05] Valvax: yup
[1:13:06] sl1nky1981: You don't NEED any of that
[1:13:07] Kazay1998: What
[1:13:08] Smooo07: WAYTOODANK
[1:13:09] Trexbo_: wat
[1:13:09] Kazay1998: 9????
[1:13:09] Syloa: ???
[1:13:10] ooTHExTUBEoo: !?!?!?!?!?
[1:13:10] sl1nky1981: It's a matter of convenience
[1:13:11] crazykman290: you can get 7 with talents
[1:13:12] Kazay1998: ?????
[1:13:12] andros299: OMEGALUL
[1:13:14] SillyPanda: That's for outlaw i think
[1:13:14] Kurama__95: You have 7
[1:13:15] Nunadaaa: huh
[1:13:16] Kazay1998: WAYTOODANK WAYTOODANK WAYTOODANK WAYTOODANK WAYTOODANK WAYTOODANK WAYTOODANK WAYTOODANK
[1:13:17] mimic124: 7
[1:13:17] Syloa: i hate that
[1:13:17] Durenas: nobody's gonna inspect your gear to make sure you're simming properly unless you invite it.
[1:13:17] zoob32: Guzu have you sim'd your pals yet? Madge
[1:13:18] meatbe4t: 7 max + 1 in rogue +1 in sub
[1:13:20] delaihc: and 300 energy?
[1:13:20] Mr_Moffert: let me just cast 7 sinister strikes in a row OkayMan
[1:13:21] mlady_telegramz97: you get 7 combo points
[1:13:22] TrueNosus: LMAO
[1:13:25] Ewriick: look at enemy bar
[1:13:25] callexy95: no
[1:13:27] its_me_: you can randomly get full combo points with 1 ability too
[1:13:28] Kazay1998: I'm going back to classic peepoLeaveFinger
[1:13:29] callexy95: you see on hes target
[1:13:29] Ewriick: nameplate
[1:13:29] mimic124: and 200 energy
[1:13:29] Chiplet209: Yeah, but if you want to be good and not get kicked from raids because underperforming, you need to sim your char.... And read your rotation aswell. Also, if you dont want to troll your m+ keys...
[1:13:31] callexy95: look at the mob
[1:13:31] GrandmMaster: rogue really been ruined ICANT
[1:13:33] Curtsy: @Guzu outlaw rogue is the highest apm spec the game has ever had, its a bit much sometimes
[1:13:38] SirNovrak: and believe this Guzu, combo points don't vanish when you swap target peepoFat
[1:13:39] SirHicarus: This video isnt objective at all, its not about answering a question, hes just giving his opinion
[1:13:40] Rixxey: anoying
[1:13:52] Trexbo_: What raids?
[1:13:52] eskilator_gl: I think it's because you can supercharge combo points maybe?
[1:13:53] mcgrittys: @Chiplet209 u dont need to sim....
[1:13:55] mlady_telegramz97: fricc simming
[1:13:56] Elijahss: Not on normal
[1:13:57] Smooo07: what was that notification
[1:13:58] Rixxey: but you're a god gamer gugu
[1:13:59] Smooo07: Wokege
[1:14:00] Syzmical: i parse 99s as unholy and do not sim, in mythic
[1:14:00] Durenas: doing your skills properly is worth more than simming
[1:14:01] Trexbo_: Heroic raids?
[1:14:02] Elijahss: or even Heroic
[1:14:03] Curtsy: 99.99% of raiders do not need to sim
[1:14:03] Rixxey: most ppl are dumb
[1:14:08] Vertigo_GB: HC and up you will struggle
[1:14:09] mlady_telegramz97: good thing I quit retail raiding man
[1:14:09] oloflame: you need stats and rotation
[1:14:12] ritter184: This coming from your ICC raid yesterday?
[1:14:13] biki2112: you dr yourself
[1:14:13] Trexbo_: Like heroic pug raids? Hmm
[1:14:15] XxGarthakxX: @Curtsy whats apm?
[1:14:15] mikkelssen: i need strenght guzuHappy
[1:14:18] ayahuana: He was talking about it being fun to press a big button, i was talking about that when i said hit cap is annoying not the simming.
[1:14:21] Curtsy: @XxGarthakxX actions pe rminute
[1:14:29] Chiplet209: Aswell in vanilla like hit cap. Somethign like Haste is also capped to a certain extend
[1:14:31] Rahmulous: @chiplet209 only in mythic prog. if you’re in a guild that requires simming and you’re not AOTC in week one of a new raid, you need to leave that guild.
[1:14:37] KattewN: So many people just can't handle a rotaion whilst handling mechanics
[1:14:41] Arlique246: @Guzu not for trinkets though, without simming u have no idea if ur trinket is good for you, and that  usually means missing thousands of DPS
[1:14:41] mordiell: had fun in wod? Susge
[1:14:51] KattewN: hence their throughput is poor
[1:14:53] sword_of_kronos: Honestly I miss the way it was during burning crusades.

[1:16:42] sword_of_kronos: I hate the fact that they scaled back the levels from 220 back to 60.,  I spent fifteen years playing to have my character nerved no thank you
[1:16:45] mikkelssen: no fun  allowed!
[1:16:47] KattewN: The number 1 thing why people perform poorly in M+ is that people aren't actually using their cooldowns. Always holds them for a boss and just wastes usages
[1:16:49] Trexbo_: @zebrakissen Oh ok Idk why he mentioned new players to begin with then, maybe I just misunderstood his overall argument.

[2:32:02] Foodlebar: get thiss 2 hander
[2:32:02] Parshce: do the pull YEP
[2:32:03] chr47: Titan's grip would be the lamest rune they could add

[2:32:13] Rixxey: TG is low-IQ

[2:32:44] handraxxx: Ad
[2:32:45] Rixxey: TG is so lame... it's a cosmetic spell
[2:32:49] DamDamPew: NO HEROIC LEAP
[2:32:49] subwrex: Its not that titan's grip is bad. it just makes having a single 2 hander or running 1h fury feel bad. its weird, way better runes/routes they can go
[2:32:52] jarl_b: Rune of adding DK to game in a lvl 60 version
[2:32:56] flowerpew: heroic leap in classic omE most buggy ability ever
