[2:54:59] Diisplaced: World bosses were never hard
[2:55:05] Diisplaced: they just lagged the server that made them hard

[2:56:57] jennerxdd: its gives a wider variety of lvl of content? so more guilds can feel a sense of progression. Instead of just hard walls for 80% of guilds
[2:57:37] Mr_Mittons: game's been around for 20 years, not sure how you're going to please everyone in an mmo
[2:57:40] K3ndo: Would be boring to not farm gear, right?

[2:59:09] K3ndo: But what else do you do, when you cleared a raid?
[2:59:49] everquest101: u an  do tmogs  ahivs, do m+ do pvp
[3:00:05] Schattenwahn: Imagine clearing the Raid 1-2 Months before the next Content COPIUM
[3:00:18] everquest101: if u only want to raid u can always go play everquest
[3:00:21] K3ndo: @everquest101 But for what reason if it's not for gear? Just for fun? Pushing score?
[3:00:25] Hippwn: Personally I agree with you
[3:00:40] K3ndo: Please no.
[3:00:47] Demy54: hehe i love this eastern european dad apple eating style :D
[3:00:58] Schattenwahn: Well Artifact Power was great, i like to do brainded stuff YEP
[3:01:03] Imch1ngy: give the boomie 590 astral power at the start, so we don't have to grind for some AP xD
[3:01:15] ARROOCE: @Schattenwahn I miss grinding something power related ngl
[3:01:41] everquest101: because are things u can do for ur character the problem is nobody  anymore in general feel atatched to his character
[3:01:42] Mr_Mittons: Today: "we need constant farm" Tomorrow: "I took two weeks off now I'm  benched"
[3:01:54] Eliteqtlol: Hello 😘 😘 ❤️
[3:02:08] boomchi_: echo are running clears every week atleast
[3:02:12] K3ndo: But it's nice to have stuff to do in a game you like playing. Currently there's not much to do if you are raiding doing m+. There are like 2-5 people online in our guild where otherwise 15-30 people are online. :D
[3:02:21] Moeinof: Farm no longer works cause of all these bots
[3:02:52] omeddrago: farming gear worst for games like BDO
[3:02:56] hadeuuz: it's ok to be white
[3:03:13] omeddrago: works*
[3:03:14] Kuroz: HUH
[3:03:20] FifiBelle_: @hadeuuz What?
[3:03:30] K3ndo: Well yes. That's why I said when raiding or playing M+. Otherwise you can do quite a lot of stuff.
[3:04:09] everquest101: i think that kind of mentality means a mmorpg has totaly failed as it doesnt bring  player full attention anymore
[3:04:16] Esox04: The point there is not enough stuff to do of that you like. If people only raid, sure there is nothig to do after a clear. But you skip pet battle, transmog, pvp etc
[3:04:24] azwraithmm: i hope they dont bring titanforge again just to farm raid agains..
[3:04:29] aurorasmokes: I took a break to grind DDV, completely an opposite game to WoW
[3:04:59] K3ndo: True, but I could find other people to play the game with, if it was just for the people. :D
[3:05:36] StreamElements: For Highlights, fun content and guides, remember to subscribe to my youtube channel -> https://www.youtube.com/naguura
[3:06:07] everquest101: people play for objetives, whenj the game makes it ends  early its normal it fail
[3:06:11] Raggu2: he means it was easy
[3:06:14] Raggu2: I believe
[3:07:07] LightdarkGaming: so 30% guilds dont disband being on one boss for 2 months?
[3:07:11] LexiSaberX: the first several bosses are too easy, the last few bosses too hard
[3:07:15] LightdarkGaming: like mine 2 weeks ago :D
[3:07:18] K3ndo: Amirdrassil was way too easy (at least on heroic). We cleared it within the 1st or 2nd week.
[3:07:32] AceReformed: Good afternoon caro naguuraSwole Good afternoon handsome chat Chadge

[3:08:12] LightdarkGaming: we had smolderon on farm, but we still kept dying to him and then we ddisbanded, we disbanded to the boss on the FARM
[3:08:20] WayneTrainOo: The problem is that Retail has such a weird tuning :D Nhc raid and hc raid loot is kinda pointless because of Mythic+ and vault and crafted gear^^ And tbh mythic raid is way to much effort for idk 90% of the playerbase. I think only students, streamer and people without work are really mythic raiding tbh
[3:08:33] Raggu2: I think hes using a lot of words to say we are acquiring gear too quickly, which I fully agree with.
[3:08:45] wicked_baboon: dude wants to afk farm mythic raid?
[3:09:12] Vendrek: Fortunately enough for my rogue a lot of my BiS comes from Mythic+...
[3:09:20] K3ndo: @Raggu2 But not getting any loot feels unsatisfying as well.
[3:09:32] AceReformed: YEP
[3:09:35] AceReformed: You lose previous tier
[3:09:37] AceReformed: And gain new tier
[3:09:45] AceReformed: Blows my mind how people still dont understand that
[3:09:51] everquest101: ofc they  want , they dont want challange or  have to work  for advance,
[3:10:01] greytgame: i just want mplus gear to be bis for mplus instead of the grind to get the trinkets from raid every tier >< . i think the raid being hard is cool for ppl that want that achievement like ce or hall of fame. i guess it depends on where blizzard wants the difficulty to be for ce / aotc .
[3:10:47] Raggu2: @K3ndo When I say too fast, I mean approaching bis way too soon. Ive been playing wow for a long time and this is one of the best expansions ive played. I have never been so well geared so quickly ever before.
[3:11:00] korean_baj: tier set jumps have to be strong because they have turned wow into a seasonal game
[3:11:07] korean_baj: it would ruin their model if people used old tier
[3:11:16] Anelit21: I saw first words of every 1,2 , 3
[3:11:17] everquest101: im having a dejavu with this topic , u guys having the same debate wec cchad on 2003 on EQ and the answer we move to wow because it`s easier
[3:11:22] Anelit21: and i see this post is so thrash KEKW
[3:11:31] LightdarkGaming: its not
[3:11:40] Raggu2: @Raggu2 I can see it taking its toll on people in my friends list, killing their desire to play with no reward to look forward to.
[3:11:54] K3ndo: @Raggu2 Well true. But it got even faster since the raid was so easy that people started boosting so early this tier. You could literally get to 70 and have your char boosted to like 460-470 in 2 boostruns.
[3:12:02] Anelit21: Mythic raiding is so good, its just people give up which is fine... there are other two difficulties
[3:12:09] WayneTrainOo: yeah let player get everything from m+ or make mythic raid more "casual friendly". Because of SOD i learned, raiding can be so much fun, even if the raid isnt difficult. because u meet your friends and u go for loot :D nhc/hc raid in retail is kinda useless gear and mythic raid is like a second work...so no one wants that besides students, streamers and workless people
[3:12:09] Anelit21: its not like you dont know what you are getting into
[3:12:10] greytgame: ya thatd be cool the only cosmetic title difficulty
[3:12:46] korean_baj: if they brought back 10man mythic raiding it would help guild/player retention
[3:12:46] K3ndo: I'd love to have only Mythic-Mechanics for all difficulties, BUT have them weakened the lower the difficulty gets.
[3:13:05] K3ndo: @korean_baj Well. With The War Within getting 20 people will be much easier.
[3:13:39] Raggu2: @K3ndo thats sort of what happens a lot of the time. The mythic mechanic is just soemthing that happens already with a twist.
[3:13:40] LightdarkGaming: its not, normal player doesnt care, no one in my guild cared either
[3:13:47] AceReformed: I agree that from a marketing perspective that Echo Vs Limit is awesome KEKLEO
[3:14:13] Anelit21: Like what is this post trying to say, I dont get it
[3:14:14] AceReformed: Yeh you are already playing
[3:14:15] K3ndo: @Raggu2 But it doesn't need a twist. It just needs tuning.
[3:14:17] AceReformed: She is talking about marketing
[3:14:20] greytgame: Ultimate difficulty for rwf/cosmetics/titles only no gear like what ppl in top end key pushers and pvpers do would actually be banger .
[3:14:21] AceReformed: So for people who do not play
[3:14:23] WeaselMuffin: already playing the game (for now)
[3:14:23] LightdarkGaming: well I quit after my guild disbanded 2 weeks ago :D
[3:14:25] AceReformed: You're already in it KEKW
[3:14:26] everquest101: Naguura  the root of wow  succes back in the day was to appeal asual players with accesibility to  high end game
[3:14:31] love_eggplant: you know what would be good marketing? making a good game
[3:14:54] daconcion: @LightdarkGaming There are also normal players who do care and do enjoy the RWF
[3:14:55] K3ndo: @love_eggplant The game is good actually. If you like it or not.
[3:14:57] Raggu2: Im watching it right now
[3:14:58] juggernautlasgo: im not a fan of multiple difficulties.
[3:15:05] AceReformed: @love_eggplant You know what is cheaper? having great marketing, blizzard is not here to make a good game
[3:15:06] heyitsdeli: anything that brings in that many viewers is marketable lol
[3:15:09] Wigglerr: Just look at the numbers on twitch, of course its marketing. I agree super obvious lol
[3:15:14] Anelit21: I have yet to see bad mythic raid from Blizzard
[3:15:15] LightdarkGaming: people watching isnt people going to play it though
[3:15:22] Vendrek: I haven't been super interested in PvE content since Cata until I saw how challenging RWF was.

[3:15:50] Zirconn__: oh this post
[3:15:54] LightdarkGaming: its a % conversion of advertisement
[3:15:59] wicked_baboon: @LightdarkGaming well i can speak with my friends about rwf, and they gonna start to play the game
[3:16:09] cptdrage: in guild atm 1-3 ppl online but on new patch/expansion 50+ ppl
[3:16:11] Zirconn__: I made my opinion known about this post and mythic raiding and got clowned on by my guild, it was quite funny
[3:16:16] LightdarkGaming: 3% of viewers for cola advertisements is minions, 3% from stream on world race is like 3k people
[3:16:22] lambowarlock: get rid of LFR.. problem solved
[3:16:23] LightdarkGaming: millions*
[3:16:28] everquest101: coca cola  won because it slowly bougth everyone markets not because market, believe or not coca cola wasnt number 1 untill the 90s
[3:16:36] adleydarling: i posted it to my officers and they just said too long didnt read SadgeCry
[3:16:37] LesterOfSmeg2: I watched the RWF just to hear your Dulcet tones since you were not doing your normal streaming
[3:16:46] Esox04: After every rwf we have so many we have so many ppl coming back. Some stay longer some stay only for a few weeks. It is great marketing even if it is on a short term
[3:16:55] VerityNS: Sure ads dont work, thats why companies like Adidas, Nike and Coca Cola advertises for 100s of millions of dollars a year. Cause they love to make ads. KEKW
[3:17:12] korean_baj: rwf viewers are mostly watching for the sport of the competition typically the NA vs EU and i doubt many of them start playing the game because of it
[3:17:33] LightdarkGaming: @VerityNS they have % conversion, they shows ads to millions, RWF is watching like 100k people, conversion is like 3%
[3:17:34] Synk_live: Being Cosmetic only would only appeal to those that like them.
[3:17:54] Raggu2: hard truth, people super into to cosmetics wouldnt do something like an ultimate.

[3:18:10] KR_Now: Do you think wow would be better if it was like baldur's gate with multiple choice npc interactions? I think it would be and they will do it mildly someday.
[3:18:11] smorc22: the only mythic change we need is no lockouts in mythic raiding + have mythic raiding loot drop from 25 + keys
[3:18:13] azumai_xyz: only having the same 2 guilds be able to compete time and time again i think will hurt RWF in the long run
[3:18:23] love_eggplant: ads so good, everyone has adblock
[3:18:26] love_eggplant: peepoBlushReallyHappyDank
[3:18:28] everquest101: NA losin to eu  isnt new ,  look at what township rebellion did to fires of heaven
[3:18:28] AceReformed: Chat is stupid today KEKW
[3:18:33] Wigglerr: Yea Naguura is literally only speaking facts lol
[3:18:47] K3ndo: If it wouldn't have value, no company would do marketing. KEKW
[3:19:17] Raggu2: the icc buff was nice.
[3:19:24] AceReformed: Maybe next time before you discuss marketing, perhaps you should first explain what marketing exactly is KEKthisguy @Naguura
[3:19:39] Kuroz: it was
[3:19:44] lulukitty: the azerite trait?
[3:20:05] lulukitty: wod ring
[3:20:06] StreamElements: Join Naguura on her journey to become the most casual of transmog farmers! Goth Naguura AKA “Nagothica” has been challenged to farm a goth transmog for her character and will be wearing a goth transmog IRL to match! Guidelines are posted in the #Nagothica channel of Naguura’s Discord. Date TBD. Check out the wish list for the event -> https://throne.com/naguura/collections/nagothika
[3:20:18] Anelit21: I dont know, is it just me? PvE is in such fine state... each time raid comes out its such a great time. Point is to see the other side, its PvP a somewhat dead part of the game. How about some PvP reworks, like updating battlegrounds, systems and sutff
[3:20:19] everquest101: drama over  sunwell  bow was better
[3:20:23] WarWolf47: they should have an extremely hard version for people to play but it should reward anything like gear or mounts it should be purely for people that want to be at the highest level like Grandmaster for StarCraft. there’s no loss for people who don’t go for it except saying they are/were grandmaster and/or going to game leagues.
[3:20:30] juggernautlasgo: they could extend the race to world first without making the content harder...they can make it time gated with resistance gear farming requirements or something similar
[3:20:35] WarWolf47: shouldn’t not should
[3:20:53] Wigglerr: Yeah the RWF raiders are absurdly good at the game. Tough to add mechanics for them
[3:20:58] K3ndo: Wasn't this the case on Kil'Jaeden?
[3:21:20] Raggu2: yea, but imagine the memes if a boss was actually mathematically impossible.
[3:21:30] WayneTrainOo: I hope they do something with mythic raiding. Most of the playerbase is 30-40 years old. So i assume if mythic raiding would be a little bit easier a lot more ppl would play it^^ I think for most of the ppl its not possible to play 3-4 evenings per week for 3-4 hours only for a mythic raid
[3:21:50] everquest101: wow havent know it  but other mmrpgs had raid bosses not killable untill  a few expansion later
[3:22:33] Wigglerr: Artificial difficulty. Its like single players rpgs making enemies bullet sponges. Its tough
[3:22:33] korean_baj: those mechanics often hurt the bulk of the feeder guilds in the long run because they dont have custom WA coders for those mechanics
[3:22:55] K3ndo: I really like if the mechanic is the issue and not the gear.
[3:23:02] Andoriel__: hi Caro konazbLoveyy
[3:23:06] Reizmaud: i was proggresing tindral before nurfs we got him to 14% and after the nurfs we kill him in 6 pulls 2 of them sub 3%
[3:23:37] yevhen: Why do Myth difficulty has to revolve around RWF and 3 best guilds in the world?
[3:23:38] Raggu2: @everquest101 Says something that it might not be the best idea to spend resources on things your palyers cant interact with. Those mmos "failed" and wow "succeeded"
[3:24:06] MurtagDev: @yevhen it doesnt
[3:24:10] everquest101: Wow was desingned to attrack casuals bro thats the whole point
[3:24:32] everquest101: others mmos raised ahrd to next level wow deccreased it and took over
[3:24:48] korean_baj: last thing the game needs is another difficulty with the high burnout rate in higher ranked guilds
[3:24:50] Eirianwen: Eirianwen subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 14 months! 
[3:24:56] xiaks_: Yeey
[3:24:57] Kuroz: naguuraLove naguuraLove naguuraLove
[3:24:59] everquest101: now we have people  complainin wow is to easy
[3:25:04] yevhen: @MurtagDev isn't that's her point to why it should be mecanically hard instead of gear check?
[3:25:12] Raggu2: @everquest101 Those old games werent hard. Standing still to cast 15 second spells and afking for 18 hours to farm a boss isnt difficult, its boring.
[3:25:36] StreamElements: For Highlights, fun content and guides, remember to subscribe to my youtube channel -> https://www.youtube.com/naguura
[3:25:38] Wigglerr: The relatable aspect was a good point you had and tough to work around. Splitting it makes it less relatable imo
[3:25:40] gronnlir: what in the wub wub
[3:25:45] phoenixrook21: simple changes such as adjusting damage, removing npcs or increasing frequency of mechanics are all good options without increasing workload on wow devs
[3:25:48] WayneTrainOo: yeah retail would be soo good if they take a few aspects from SOD. especially if they make mythic raiding available for a higher % of the playerbase. 10 player would be awesome.
[3:25:49] Szmirk: jeez this music sounds like your putting a speaker into a blender
[3:25:56] Pokket_Gaming: Or just stop tuning bosses to world first teams. Competitive game play has ruined WoW.
[3:26:26] everquest101: care to explain me why then these older games designers were absorbed by bliz to do wow expansions?
[3:26:46] Ganryu22: music is a bit loud
[3:26:54] Anelit21: Why is he starting his topic with retort
[3:27:23] Schattenwahn: Where is Brainpower in this Playlist?!

[3:28:17] cptdrage: be happy othervise there wouldnt be druids in raid
[3:28:18] Gamerhcp: !song
[3:28:18] StreamElements: Current Song: VINAI, Olly James - Eternal
[3:28:22] Gamerhcp: Susge
[3:28:31] WeaselMuffin: i think its for the same reason we don't want them - this class is "bad" but someone likes to play it so they don't feel forced to reroll to a meta class to have a chance of being picked
[3:28:39] WeaselMuffin: its cooked
[3:28:42] korean_baj: class buffs are an issue now because they took most of them away
[3:28:45] Sulm: I only enjoyed the buffs when multiple classes could bring the same buff
[3:28:46] cptdrage: just bring back scrolls
[3:28:50] Anelit21: Super casual guild doesnt play mythic raid
[3:28:53] gronnlir: bring back scrolls
[3:29:05] Khaosshinobi: class buffs only really made sense when every class had a buff like they used to in mop/wod
[3:29:07] Lenietwitch: fantasy, flavor, truth is you dont need all buffs, hainvg  all the buffs is a min max that only hardcore guilds needs todo
[3:29:09] korean_baj: a lot of classes 10 years ago shared class buffs but they stopped that creating the issue we have now
[3:29:12] Frink84: it's the rest of a phantasy and lore orientented game. they never thought of the game being so competitive back then
[3:29:15] Raggu2: I think Max said this a few weeks ago but I would also like to see it. A real dps chart of what a class actually brings to a raid, like ff14s realdps
[3:29:55] AceReformed: I really, REALLY dont understand the fetish with buffs, bringing a class PURELY for a buff feels so awkward, and i've been playing this game for 20 years
[3:29:56] Wigglerr: Does every class need to be top tier in mythic raiding?
[3:29:59] WayneTrainOo: I mean there is a reason why more and more guilds leave the race and the mythic raiding.
[3:30:09] WeaselMuffin: no i agree i don't think it solves theh problem at all
[3:30:09] Vendrek: At the end of the day a lot of players love the concept of parsing. If their guild does not have all of the buffs and raid CDs then they feel gimped and don't have a chance to parse because of the disparity that meta classes provide.
[3:30:25] WeaselMuffin: but i think that's what the intention was
[3:30:57] Raggu2: @Vendrek not just aprsing. Losing *only* mark is a flat 3% throughput loss to your entire raid. Its huge
[3:31:00] TwistedMikester: i am :)
[3:31:01] AceReformed: Yeh, if resto is the best druid specc, and you want MoTW, you automatically demote the other speccs to garbage, and everyone will bring a resto
[3:31:57] Vendrek: @Raggu2 That is part of my point
[3:32:00] Raggu2: Enjoying ads slootRoll
[3:32:17] AceReformed: Also it is cringe as fuck
[3:32:23] Wigglerr: Parsing is pointless other than for e peen
[3:32:47] Anelit21: I think its good, its separates good from great guild
[3:32:48] countrycount: but what if i like my e peen?!
[3:32:57] criptos: it always has been, usually just the players that ignore mechanics or get lucky and don't get them.
[3:33:00] Wigglerr: @countrycount then parse
[3:33:06] Raggu2: @Wigglerr You parse well enough with good regularity guilds will approach you. So its not for nothing.
[3:33:36] korean_baj: yeah but that argument can be invalidated by the improved wcl filtering system
[3:33:46] R3w4s: nowadays parsing is fkd if you are not getting auged perma with how aug hooks dont work on logs its kinda pointless
[3:33:57] Morganith: spill
[3:34:03] criptos: they just need to bring back the glyph craftable versions that are weaker similar to drums
[3:34:12] criptos: would be good enough for anyone outside WF guilds
[3:34:16] Raggu2: Agreed, parses now are fked.
[3:34:46] kaverrr: Dude Moonkins were arguing they should get a specific spec buff 😂
[3:34:52] Raggu2: dude, just not knowing which way a mob is facing at a glance is infuriating as a melee
[3:34:57] PapysChulys: The thing is they added so much that the couple class remaining that don't have one are always picked last or depending on their status during the season. So they sould either remove class buffs or give everyone one
[3:35:07] Frink84: wow is NOT final fantasy. pls DONT !!!
[3:35:09] Vendrek: The other thing that I think players get upset about and is very noticable on the forums is when a class buff is changed or remove they feel like they have lost some measure of their class identity as well their place among a raid.
[3:35:23] Raggu2: I fully agree with this point. the ui and informations gleaned is bottom tier.
[3:35:36] StreamElements: For Highlights, fun content and guides, remember to subscribe to my youtube channel -> https://www.youtube.com/naguura
[3:35:40] Anelit21: I dont know what happened in Legion but I know i didnt think about anything it was so peaceful, i was staring at my PC 24 hours
[3:35:47] Gamerhcp: ratJAM
[3:35:53] Anelit21: Today I am listening about other people complaining about game

[3:36:23] AceReformed: GroupJAM
[3:37:00] LightdarkGaming: ???huh
[3:37:20] Wigglerr: UI is way better but its still kinda ass
[3:37:37] criptos: Yiiikes...  Being able to customize the UI even more without downloading an addon would be amazing
[3:37:47] korean_baj: ^
[3:37:51] LightdarkGaming: how would u even know that
[3:38:06] StreamElements: If you enjoy the stream make sure to check naguura out on her Socials : https://twitter.com/Naguura // https://www.youtube.com/naguura // https://www.instagram.com/naguura // tiktok.com/@naguura
[3:38:08] criptos: but his whole point is why can't it be as customizable as addons, in the base game.... You literally just proved his point
[3:38:15] LightdarkGaming: yeh but not without addons :D
[3:38:16] Vendrek: My biggest problem with addons and WAs in the game is when there are addons/WAs that tell the player what to press. It is literally a bot script that doesn't do the action for you but still tells you what the next button you should press and 99% of players will press that button.
[3:38:21] korean_baj: imagine being able to customize your nameplates without player LUL
[3:38:25] korean_baj: plater*
[3:38:26] LightdarkGaming: yeh cause they suck, which is the point
[3:38:30] Raggu2: Addons should improve functionality to fit personal preference not create something that isnt provided at all @Naguura
[3:38:31] PapysChulys: This is the Echo of Neltharion problem all over again. Blizzard got mad during Jailer that people had WA's telling them where to drop bombs. They complained about WA and then created Echo of Neltharion...
[3:38:33] Schattenwahn: HYPERJAMMIES HYPERJAMMIES HYPERJAMMIES HYPERJAMMIES HYPERJAMMIES HYPERJAMMIES
[3:38:49] korean_baj: i disagree with this the DF UI is great! *uses plater* LUL
[3:38:50] Gapplebees1: We don't need Blizzard to try to replace Plater.
[3:38:53] LightdarkGaming: yeh, it makes the game better if its in the game
[3:38:57] criptos: YES! you should be able to customize it like elv ui / plater in the base game
[3:39:08] Plokoon100: EZ ban addons
[3:39:13] Pokket_Gaming: Just get rid of add-ons and put everyone on the same level.
[3:39:14] silentkillervgc: @Vendrek some specs is close to unplayable without WA tho
[3:39:27] Synk_live: I hate having to use Elvui / plater or *insert whichever addon* to get what should be base functionaiity
[3:39:29] criptos: No, you just hide away the advanced settings
[3:39:44] Wigglerr: Give players too many options and they could just quit cause it looks overwhelming
[3:39:45] korean_baj: its better than NOT having the option to have those settings
[3:39:48] Raggu2: Plater is not for beginners for sure.
[3:40:03] criptos: I can't believe someone is arguing the base UI shouldn't be even more customizable... insane
[3:40:06] LightdarkGaming: yeh people 99^ people just import
[3:40:09] Deckx: They could just make it have all the settings and make their own database or website on which people can easily share their UIs through integrated systems
[3:40:13] korean_baj: @criptos i know right LUL
[3:40:14] Raggu2: Ive used palter for a long time and doing things that are a simple slider for other addons is a hassle.
[3:40:21] Vendrek: @silentkillervgc I don't mind WAs...what I hate is addons and WAs that tell the player what button to push. Those addons and WAs are partial bot scripts.
[3:40:24] Wigglerr: Bloat
[3:40:29] wicked_baboon: they can split settings into simple/advanced
[3:40:29] LightdarkGaming: literally 99% people import profiles
[3:40:30] ElynWow: You can hide the settings on some sort of advanced mode that new players dont even need to touch
[3:40:33] Anelit21: It might scare off people
[3:40:35] love_eggplant: ever heard of presets?
[3:41:08] ignfrost: will this be a youtube vid later so i can rewatch it?
[3:41:08] korean_baj: they have a "base UI" set option and the option to make it yourself, they can do the same for nameplates
[3:41:12] AceReformed: HYPERJAMMIES
[3:41:13] tropicoxo: dbm needs to be core for sure though. they make it too hard for new players to learn any mechanics
[3:41:15] love_eggplant: the addons are memory hogging, it should be added in the base game, optimized by expert developers
[3:41:32] LightdarkGaming: ELvui, import, WAs, import, Details, import, PLater, import, I have never used any options or was overwhelmed, to this day idk any options in Plater, I just imported what looked alright
[3:41:44] criptos: I'm actually mind blown with your take on this
[3:41:48] Anelit21: Doc Pog
[3:41:48] criptos: to each their own, but crazy to me
[3:41:50] Gapplebees1: Neltharion bombs were so bad
[3:42:00] Deckx: I'm still very much a supporter of Blizzard adding WeakAuras to WoW baseline and to integrate the system into the game.
[3:42:13] azylum99: the complexity of mechanics is the root of problems
[3:42:16] korean_baj: download WA pack, download M+ plater pack, download UI LUL so overwhelming!
[3:42:39] TiPera: Didn't they say that they release the bosses thinking of people developing WAs in order to kill them? Or I'm dreaming?
[3:42:40] Tophwow: Also something like neltharion, you can theoretically sort without WAs but only really good players would be able to do it consistently and everyone else would just be stuck
[3:42:45] silentkillervgc: @Vendrek outlaw rogue is unplayable without WA because you need to track a lot of buffs
[3:42:54] criptos: All they would have needed to do was put a number or icon above each players head
[3:42:59] criptos: it wouldn't need to say go left
[3:43:08] criptos: just number bombs 1-5 and let use assign positions
[3:43:18] WeaselMuffin: i think people arent trying to solve problems because weakauras exist so they don't need to, too - not every mechanic is playable without, but i think there are some mechanics that people tout "require weakauras" theoretically dont
[3:43:20] Shrugal: Popup: "Press A for 2 seconds"
[3:43:22] Gapplebees1: @Tophwow hard disagree. you needed the weakaura or you were just rolling the dice every pull.
[3:43:25] criptos: it's both a UI issue and a design encounter issue
[3:43:41] Deckx: Throwback to Mythic Archimonde, what a time to be alive
[3:43:43] LightdarkGaming: there is a lot of complex strategies in ff14 right, and they can do it without them, while using ingame stuff
[3:44:00] Exently: i mean there is a simple solution in example for neltharion add a 2 sec. delay to getting the boms so the order is set automaticly or use colors on some mechanics
[3:44:01] korean_baj: people having to download customize github russian addons/wa's for u'nat
[3:44:03] ignfrost: is a lot easier to organize in ffxiv cause you only have to deal with 8 people
[3:44:18] LightdarkGaming: @ignfrost true, but still pretty complex from what I saw
[3:44:26] Raggu2: @LightdarkGaming Abilities are clearly amrked, deterministic on who gets them and never random. its quite a bit different.
[3:44:27] Tophwow: @Gapplebees1 Nah you can do it its just very complicated and never worth doing because you have weakauras
[3:44:38] LightdarkGaming: @Raggu2 thats how it should be then:D
[3:44:55] love_eggplant: do you think its normal they have developers making addons to kill bosses?
[3:44:56] Gapplebees1: @Tophwow Show me a guild that did that fight without the weakaura in less than 300 pulls and I'll agree with you
[3:44:58] Gileard: they should limit the addons that can impact raids and that style of gameplay. The dificulty would rump up without the need of crazy mecanics
[3:45:00] VerityNS: I mean do you think that if we was not allowed to use any addons that the WF guilds would have taken down the bosses in this expansions raids?
[3:45:03] Raggu2: Like, you give the BEST ff14 guild nelth bombs. They might disband
[3:45:08] Tophwow: @Gapplebees1 That is exactly my point Lol
[3:45:36] StreamElements: For Highlights, fun content and guides, remember to subscribe to my youtube channel -> https://www.youtube.com/naguura
[3:46:06] Tophwow: @Gapplebees1 Echo COULD do it but there is no need to, and even IF Echo could have done it then there is no way a world 400 guild can
[3:46:12] korean_baj: well you were all for those mechanics earlier rather than damage/healing checks
[3:46:15] criptos: But it's not... if when you got bombs on nelth and each player got a unique icon or number above their head, we would have never needed the WA
[3:46:26] criptos: it's both UI and encounter design
[3:46:29] ignfrost: @LightdarkGaming yeah but player count in raids matter a lot for strats, mechanics are extremely complex in ffxiv but making 8 people adjust for it is doable, making 20 people adjust for those kind of mechanics would be atrocious
[3:46:38] Neztea: blizz should make their own WA package for players kik
[3:46:41] Neztea: *kek
[3:46:43] Ritashi2: @Raggu2 not sure if you play FF14 much, full random mechanics are extremely common in ultimate content and becoming more common in Savage as well
[3:46:58] Anelit21: I dont see single idea from this post on how HE WOULD SOLVE current situation
[3:47:05] Anelit21: how is this constructive post
[3:47:19] love_eggplant: its unfair that they pay developers to make cheating weakauras
[3:47:25] Tophwow: Everyone would have to learn each position
[3:47:26] love_eggplant: just so they can be nr 1
[3:47:30] WeaselMuffin: "how do nelth bombs work" - 90% of myst, 2023
[3:47:31] Tophwow: without weakaura
[3:47:55] Gapplebees1: @Tophwow so take a ~100 pull boss and make it a 300+ pull boss because group wants to 'outplay' the boss without weakaura. No thanks.

[3:48:09] Tophwow: @Gapplebees1 Exactly
[3:48:16] criptos: Sure it has logic in the WA, but you'd still be able to do it on the fly with just numbers without a WA / private aura macro bullshit.   I'm not saying it's a perfect solution but there is simple things they could do with UI in game to make mechanics like that doable without a WA
[3:48:23] criptos: I understand what you're say tho
[3:48:26] silentkillervgc: nelth is both UI and encounter design issues
[3:48:41] WeaselMuffin: and that doesnt even take into account how viable it is to take that position given random assignments
[3:48:56] love_eggplant: its literally in the name. private… why is it accessible
[3:49:01] Tophwow: If there was no weakaura that would have been one of the possible solutions
[3:49:04] silentkillervgc: we had to use weakaura for thundering because thundering UI is so ass
[3:49:28] Raggu2: @Ritashi2 perhaps youre right. I havent watched any ff14 content in over a year.
[3:50:05] Neztea: nelth was an anomaly

Guidelines are posted in the #Nagothica channel of Naguura’s Discord. Date TBD. Check out the wish list for the event -> https://throne.com/naguura/collections/nagothika
[3:50:06] Tophwow: @Raggu2 You do know that ff14 top guilds literally make equivalent things to weakauras
[3:51:01] Ritashi2: @Tophwow Some do, especially race teams, but not all of them do; and most groups would consider that to be cheating
[3:51:05] Raggu2: @Tophwow youre suggesting the solution is cheating. not saying I agree with their stance on addons.
[3:51:33] Tophwow: Also ff is a very different game, the mechanics play every differently
[3:51:47] Ritashi2: I don't think the FF14 discussion is that relevant to your points tbh @Naguura
[3:51:50] ignfrost: @Tophwow world first teams certainly do, but the vast majority of players that do content does not use and don't need to
[3:51:53] Raggu2: it started with talk about clearly amrked visuals and mechanics being different not being comparable to wow.
[3:51:55] Ren26: ff14 uses unqiue debuffs, markers, and numbers to have random assignments in a way that can be solved wihtout addons
[3:51:55] Sebleh: “top guilds in ffxiv” that’s how I know yall don’t know wtf you’re talking about because there are no “top guilds” competing in ffxiv rwf. it’s all a mishmash from different servers.
[3:52:00] Tophwow: Basically guy was saying that ff14 people do complex stuff without weakauras @Naguura
[3:52:01] Deenial: The TL;DR is arguing complexity of fights and needing "add-ons"
[3:52:16] criptos: You could by counting the list yeah and going to that position.  But again that's relying on a WA package to generate a list that you had to read to see your position. Without that list from a WA package you wouldn't be able to just spread out the bombs. Iono I just think both UI and Encounter Design are the problem with Mythic Raider not just one or the other.
[3:52:29] Raggu2: @Tophwow Literally didnt.
[3:52:37] VerityNS: VerityNS subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 9 months! 
[3:52:42] Kuroz: naguuraLove naguuraLove naguuraLove
[3:52:43] ignfrost: @Sebleh they probably meant world first teams
[3:52:58] Ren26: there are many exampels in FF where the assignments arent restricted via role too
[3:53:00] Tophwow: @Sebleh People are just saying guild for simplicity, ff has different systems in place ofc
[3:53:17] Deenial: There's an easier thought process because it's either "pair mechanic, 1 dps, 1 tank" or "all tanks and healers" there's fixed variables
[3:53:18] Deenial: yep
[3:53:36] Ritashi2: I mean a lot of FF mechanics are fully random between all 8 players, with 8 possible positions for every player. There's a lot of these in DSR and TOP
[3:54:04] Bleak07: HmmmOK
[3:54:12] Tophwow: @Ritashi2 Yes but top groups also take more than 1k pulls for some ultimates
[3:54:24] Tophwow: because people need more time learning all the patterns
[3:54:48] Deenial: Yeah 8 people learning all variables is easier than 20
[3:54:51] Tophwow: When was the last time a boss has taken more than 500 pulls in wow for echo or liquid
[3:55:02] ignfrost: recent raids there's a lot more full random mechanics, in the last ultimate TOP every mechanic is random for all roles
[3:55:07] korean_baj: some indicators in wow are seriously shit tho
[3:55:08] Ritashi2: @Tophwow I mean yeah, FF14 is about puzzle solving so the first group to clear will have way more pulls than the 50th
[3:55:21] Anelit21: Organization
[3:55:25] Tophwow: @Ritashi2 Yeh exactly
[3:55:27] silentkillervgc: @Tophwow pretty sure its from legion
[3:55:35] Tophwow: @silentkillervgc uunat
[3:55:36] StreamElements: For Highlights, fun content and guides, remember to subscribe to my youtube channel -> https://www.youtube.com/naguura
[3:55:37] Stricken79: 24 AD timed EZ
[3:55:38] Tophwow: I think
[3:55:41] ophencie_bdo: i think mythic raiding was better back then in WoW
[3:55:42] Stricken79: nearly 3050 now
[3:55:43] big_hero_d: lets be honest TOP guild have different difficulties of Raid, otherwise RWF finish in 1 day and blizard speak open about it, at the time when they releasing new Raid they have Echo and Team Liquid in mind in case of scaling difficulty
[3:56:02] Anelit21: I dont see anything wrong with PvE
[3:56:05] Bleak07: danBlob danDJ danBlob
[3:56:05] silentkillervgc: @Tophwow close enough
[3:56:08] Anelit21: I just hope they turn back to PvP
[3:56:13] criptos: @big_hero_d 100%, the Tindral I killed and the Fyrakk I'm progressing would have died so fast for them
[3:56:37] silentkillervgc: uunat and KJ is only bosses that have over 500 pulls
[3:56:42] Ritashi2: A really common strat in FF14 is to have all players stand in a line and assign 1st second third etc based on visually seeing that line
[3:56:49] Tophwow: @silentkillervgc avatar as well I think
[3:56:52] Tophwow: fallen avatar
[3:57:06] Raggu2: thats what I said, and got blasted. Hmm, interesting.
[3:57:11] Raggu2: slootHmm
[3:57:18] silentkillervgc: @Tophwow avatar is like 450 from first kill
[3:57:23] manthyx: the game design is very diferent
[3:57:23] ignfrost: mostly because its a lot easier to stablish pre-positions with 8 players than with 20
[3:57:29] Tophwow: @silentkillervgc Ah okay so its below that
[3:57:31] hidingi: The discussion about panini being italian is weird today.
[3:57:42] silentkillervgc: uunat is 731 and KJ is 655
[3:57:44] Neztea: Is that the fix then? lol
[3:57:51] silentkillervgc: avatar is 454
[3:57:59] criptos: God I miss 10M heroic
[3:58:04] criptos: that was the most fun I had raiding
[3:58:05] Deenial: @criptos mood
[3:58:06] StreamElements: If you enjoy the stream make sure to check naguura out on her Socials : https://twitter.com/Naguura // https://www.youtube.com/naguura // https://www.instagram.com/naguura // tiktok.com/@naguura
[3:58:14] silentkillervgc: arch in HFC is 473 pulls
[3:58:16] Sianzu: Ohhh what Pizza is she drawing??
[3:58:21] korean_baj: 10man heroic was so nice
[3:58:27] ferzerp: It's ok.  You can say FFXIV is just easier ;)
[3:58:29] Deenial: @Sianzu that's the new apartment layout
[3:58:34] Tophwow: in ff the game often also draws the weakauras for you basically
[3:58:46] Sianzu: @Deenial Not very Feng Shui'y
[3:58:48] Gapplebees1: @korean_baj we have 10 man heroic now?
[3:58:49] Tophwow: while in wow you just use weakauras to emulate it
[3:58:51] y0rge: didnt there was drama in ff14 best guild used wa ? and they was banned ?
[3:59:00] korean_baj: @Gapplebees1 10man heroic back then would be 10man mythic now
[3:59:03] criptos: ^
[3:59:08] Ritashi2: @y0rge yeah that did happen, twice actually
[3:59:12] big_hero_d: well the case also that WOW raid are "complex" now is only because we  have WA and they are a huge part of WOW UI, if something can be solve by algorythm then they need to do more complex stuff
[3:59:21] Ren26: ff14 good wow bad btw
[3:59:31] big_hero_d: thats the reason they also start implemented Private Auras
[3:59:34] Gapplebees1: @korean_baj 10 man heroic back then was not even as difficult as current heroic
[3:59:34] Raggu2: Why bananas
[3:59:35] Sianzu: But both are fruit...therefore samething? Hmm
[3:59:37] AceReformed: True banana's are better pgeKEK
[3:59:39] criptos: heroic was the highest difficulty, 25m / 10m. Then when WoD was coming out and SoO coming to an end, they implement Mythic
[3:59:55] warryvibe: Banana apple?
[4:00:04] Tophwow: I mean its obvious that if you dont have a ptr to test things and you have to learn patterns that youre gonna take more pulls but pull count also does not equal difficulty
[4:00:05] big_hero_d: lets imagine, they will ban weakAura and other Addons then ofc raid designe will change as well
[4:00:14] manthyx: r bananas vegetables?
[4:00:24] Raggu2: Listen, I got told in vanilla that addons were cheating in westfall general chat.
[4:00:31] manthyx: monkaHmm
[4:00:53] big_hero_d: It require time
[4:00:54] Ren26: if a mechanic requires a 3rd party addon/tool to process it, then its probably just a bad mechanic
[4:00:58] plaguedot: lol i paly tarren mill as well but alliance naguuraHypers  i got some horde chracters cause i like taurens so far and blood elfs
[4:01:06] plaguedot: play*
[4:01:10] big_hero_d: lets hope in War Whithin designe will be adjusted to be without WA
[4:01:38] korean_baj: once blizzard starts using AI to make raid encounters it wont be "difficult"
[4:01:42] kadashy1: sound impossible tbh
[4:01:46] Tophwow: I mean most last bosses are way too hard for normal guilds thats why they get nerfed
[4:01:53] Raggu2: It seems really difficult to have a mechanic or encounter that doesnt require an addon that also isnt completely solved by an addon.
[4:01:58] criptos: Tindral was a special kind of hell
[4:02:02] Pokket_Gaming: The game should not be based around the race to world first guilds.
[4:02:06] criptos: so many 1 shot the raid checks.. F that boss
[4:02:09] dolesscoke: isn't the hot take there that : the game shouldn't be designed for 2 guilds in a game?
[4:02:18] Tophwow: @Pokket_Gaming It really is not though
[4:02:32] Tophwow: If it was they would make bosses way harder
[4:02:37] Tophwow: earlier bosses especially
[4:02:46] big_hero_d: Im still dont get any legendary and i have like 3 evokers and 10 2h STR alts that im normaly plays xD
[4:02:57] criptos: The last bosses are 100% tuned around echo and liquid lately.
[4:03:01] TotallyNotRaien: legendaries are bad
[4:03:08] Turtle_live: do legendary transmogs only !
[4:03:10] Sianzu: D: F bomb
[4:03:12] Pokket_Gaming: @Tophwow It is when you have to constantly nerf bosses. They make the bosses harder for the race and then nerf it for normal people.
[4:03:18] TotallyNotRaien: they never get their drop right anyway
[4:03:33] dolesscoke: Why is it that a whole entire video games end game should be designed around 2 guilds? Isn't that a bit odd?
[4:03:34] Tophwow: @Pokket_Gaming And? the normal people are not getting there when the nerfs happen
[4:03:34] Raggu2: my favorite legendaries were the fun ones from legion, like multiple heroic leaps
[4:03:34] Neztea: rng for leggo acquisition is cringe AF
[4:03:44] Tophwow: @Pokket_Gaming Its not like it affects them in any way
[4:03:45] Totteman: why does it have to be fair tho?
[4:03:59] TotallyNotRaien: because its a videogame for fun
[4:04:10] korean_baj: well it was a raid required effort for those legendaries
[4:04:15] Sianzu: I liked the MoP legendaries. You worked towards them over a long time. Felt u earned it @Naguura
[4:04:29] manthyx: on legion legendaris feth very bad
[4:04:43] Neztea: i disagree, legendary at least for me is all about power not rarity
[4:04:43] Ritashi2: Lock Legendaries to HoF only, this will have no negative consequences I'm sure
[4:04:58] big_hero_d: @Sianzu MOP dont have legendary - it was just external power source called "legendary" but no legendary item in a sense
[4:05:07] Raggu2: Shadowmourne
[4:05:07] Tophwow: Yeh but they did not feel like legendaries
[4:05:10] Daikanatv: cloak was mop
[4:05:13] The_Aonyx_Otter: Make Legendaries really rare cosmetics.
[4:05:17] korean_baj: thats the problem though people are too worried about "whats fair"
[4:05:18] Synk_live: In Legion I didn't get a legendary until the final patch, I didnt play a ton but it still felt bad
[4:05:23] Tophwow: shadowmourne also does not feel legendary in wrath tbh
[4:05:23] Sianzu: @big_hero_d yer it did the cloak
[4:05:23] criptos: It's also how Val'anyr and Shadowmourne, Firelands staff and the DS daggers worked
[4:05:34] plaguedot: i hve over than 30k runs dungeons back in legion farming legend's and keys
[4:05:34] Shrugal: They took a long time but did not require extra efford, so everyone had them at some point
[4:05:35] The_Aonyx_Otter: Blizzard can't win when it comes to legendaries
[4:05:35] TwistedMikester: how about we build our own weapon?
[4:05:35] Tophwow: Yeh but such items dont feel legendary anymore
[4:05:36] StreamElements: For Highlights, fun content and guides, remember to subscribe to my youtube channel -> https://www.youtube.com/naguura
[4:05:52] Pokket_Gaming: @Tophwow Because one of the points this guy makes in the post is that when your progressing on a boss and then the boss gets nerfed the next week. It feels bad.
[4:06:13] korean_baj: it wasnt a certainty for firelands staff if you didnt have a guild/raid
[4:06:18] utkutl: Hello Carol Evening !! Have Fun !
[4:06:19] criptos: To be fair you weren't 100% going to get it back then if you weren't high enough on the list to be the one working on it
[4:06:25] criptos: Especially shadowmourne
[4:06:37] criptos: less so Tarecgosa with 25M heroic getting to work on multiple at once
[4:06:46] criptos: but you weren't gauranteed to get shadowmourne in wrath
[4:06:50] y0rge: legendary in legion was worse system e ver made in this game
[4:06:51] silentkillervgc: if the boss get nerfed, people have to relearn the boss again
[4:06:52] Wigglerr: Werent leggos hated in legion?
[4:06:57] Tophwow: @Pokket_Gaming I mean thats only a problem very few people have, so doesnt that make it something thats tuned towards "normal" players
[4:07:01] imaginarity: its just not a legendary when you are playing whole season without item, while your entire class balanced over legendary that you dont have it is cringe
[4:07:07] The_Aonyx_Otter: didn't they put in some bad luck protection later in legion
[4:07:09] Gapplebees1: We just needed the vendor in addition to the random drops
[4:07:09] korean_baj: LUL rng drop "felt legendary" ???
[4:07:18] Wigglerr: It was dumb as hell to just do every random thing on thre world for a random chance at a leggo. Idk I did not like that myself
[4:07:19] Synk_live: Legion has bad implementation, at least until the last patch where you could buy them
[4:07:19] Esox04: Legendarys in legion were only good after they removed the cap and you coud "farm" them
[4:07:34] Tophwow: they did not feel legendary
[4:07:35] criptos: @Naguura What if they did it Shadowmourne style where only 1 person could build it at once and it was more built for mythic raiding guilds
[4:07:41] Tophwow: they felt like a relieve when you got the legendary you needed
[4:07:52] Jarettol: the rogue lego in cata...with the multiple weeklong questline to empower it felt pretty legendary to me
[4:08:02] Tophwow: Yeh its the same with the axe
[4:08:05] korean_baj: if you were the first in your raid you'd have thought it was legendary

[4:08:06] criptos: They made 25 Man heroic craft them soooooo fast
[4:08:17] Tophwow: its like, yeh I finally have my class balance patch and I paid 300k gold for it
[4:08:23] Totteman: Isnt his point that they should be rare and not "expected" to get even if you play a class that can use it
[4:08:26] criptos: it's was annoying as a 10M heroic guild we got our first staff when the 25M heroic guild on our server already had 3
[4:08:41] Tophwow: @Totteman Thats bad design though
[4:08:47] jinji_chu: Hello :)
[4:09:08] flahhoz: I dont know if thats necesarily the truth in all cases. Legendary can be also something where you work through interesting and compelling quests (not like current lego quests) or thru killing a specific boss like warglaives
[4:09:13] Tophwow: ngl, jailer weapon felt more legendary than the the current axe
[4:09:14] Totteman: Why bad design? why is 100% balanced and 100% fair game fun?
[4:09:34] Orgabism: Having to pay hundreds of gold to get the legendary could feel....legendary too, right? :)
[4:09:39] Taiya: legendary aquisition in guild wars 2 feels legendary
[4:09:46] Taiya: they should take notes
[4:09:52] criptos: Who cares, especially if it wasn't made before RWF was done.
[4:09:55] Tophwow: @Totteman idk about you but for the majority of players it would just feel bad if it was a rare drop barely anyone has
[4:09:58] korean_baj: theres nothing wrong with that
[4:10:04] Pokket_Gaming: It wouldn't make it broken if only a few people had it.
[4:10:05] Neztea: yeah lol,
[4:10:10] flahhoz: @Orgabism well not really when you can just swipe your credit card xd
[4:10:22] korean_baj: yes
[4:10:22] criptos: I mean it'd feel legendary
[4:10:26] Taiya: the legendaries can be utility based or just have fun effects
[4:10:27] Totteman: Why not? theres still skill
[4:10:34] criptos: so why not, and cycle through the roles each patch for a new legendary
[4:10:41] criptos: tank, healer, m dps, r dps
[4:10:42] korean_baj: yes.
[4:10:43] Shrugal: I think special visual effects are much more important
[4:10:43] criptos: repeat
[4:10:46] Gaz_Games_: game is already inbalanced enough lol
[4:10:49] criptos: Yea, it's a game have FUN!
[4:10:50] Lenietwitch: i dont mind honestly
[4:10:54] big_hero_d: is that a case now? no, Ret and Fury are high only because of buff they collect over patch not by legendary
[4:10:55] Totteman: you are seeing things from esports view? while 99.99% dont play the game even considering esport
[4:11:03] criptos: because being broken is fun sometimes
[4:11:03] Taiya: legendaries should just be cool looking weapons that give you cool spell effects
[4:11:06] Lenietwitch: game will never be balance 100%, i dont care if a spec is broken 1 tier, it always happens it always will be
[4:11:06] criptos: and it's a video game
[4:11:09] Lenietwitch: legendary or not
[4:11:09] Plokoon100: becuase i want to be broken
[4:11:09] korean_baj: why do we want everything to be perfectly balanced?
[4:11:09] Raggu2: Says the druid main LUL
[4:11:10] Plokoon100: :D
[4:11:16] Jarettol: I think at this point in WoW...legendaries should be a cosmetic and achievement without a strength increase
[4:11:18] DrBazingaSC: all specs should have access to legendary, not class-based....
[4:11:18] Tophwow: @Totteman Yeh and out of those 99.99% 99% who dont have the legendary are unhappy
[4:11:20] TotallyNotRaien: mage is always broken tho
[4:11:21] TiPera: when is the mage not broken tho? LUL
[4:11:21] big_hero_d: hearing about broken spec from Moonking feels kinda weird xD
[4:11:32] Ritashi2: if mage gets that kind of legendary good luck getting invited to keys or raid as another ranged spec
[4:11:34] Raggu2: Thanos quote
[4:11:34] Totteman: literally none is unhappy about not having the new legendary axe
[4:11:37] SparkleRainbow_: Has there ever been a tank legendary item?
[4:11:39] AceReformed: @big_hero_d ??
[4:11:42] korean_baj: are  you suggesting that thanos was right?
[4:11:44] slappygilmore_: I agree with you, but dont you think that the old style of aquisition (shadowmourne) would prevent everyone from rerolling since only one gets made at a time?
[4:11:49] Tophwow: @Totteman Thats just wrong
[4:11:57] Synk_live: Legendaries at this point should just be a ring / trinket, available to all specs and do something class based. Although would still have balance issues I suppose
[4:12:11] criptos: If I knew there was going to be a rotation through the specs where each role would get a legendary at some point in the xpack then hell ya let a role / spec be busted for a patch
[4:12:21] AustrianCellian: guys, she plays moonkin forever and not just because its good now in highkeys... same with me I main RET since like 12 years now and went through all the highs and even more lows of the spec
[4:12:24] Tophwow: If you have something like shadowmourne
[4:12:24] Orgabism: All the gear in high content should be made into legendaries, but maybe not with damage effects on them, just standard items that do something special, like utility maybe. So we could all have legendaries, always.
[4:12:35] TotallyNotRaien: why does it have to be weapons tho?
[4:12:36] criptos: But that's part of what made TF and Glaives Legendary
[4:12:37] Pokket_Gaming: Imagine if 1/10 mages had the legendary because it was actually difficult to get. It would't make the item a requirement. And those players would feel legendary.
[4:12:38] criptos: They were OP
[4:12:44] TotallyNotRaien: cant it be neck, rings, legs or something
[4:12:57] Raggu2: 25k right
[4:12:58] Tophwow: it goes the other way too
[4:13:01] wayslay: what spec is op this season because of legendary?
[4:13:01] Raggu2: right now*
[4:13:15] Tophwow: If a class gets a legendary but does not have it, it is just worse if its balanced with the legendary in mind
[4:13:15] Totteman: Why cant they be overpowered? everyone that clears the raid can still clear the raid without it just that some people will  have a lot more fun doing it
[4:13:17] ferzerp: what about what PI does to the recipient then?
[4:13:19] criptos: I mean it's no different now in high end M+ really
[4:13:23] Sianzu: You don't like Rain of Fire spam?
[4:13:32] criptos: some classes are just busted
[4:13:41] Synk_live: Is any class with the Lego Axe considered OP though? Warrior with axe is still barely useful
[4:13:42] Raggu2: @wayslay none, we were all scaled to have it.
[4:13:49] Tophwow: @Totteman Everyone else has less fun then, you are taking away enjoyment of 99% for 1%, which is exactly what you are argueing against, no?
[4:14:02] wayslay: @Raggu2 thats my point i think they did a good job with it
[4:14:03] Gapplebees1: @Totteman this is wrong. if one class is 10% stronger, then a lot of people just can't clear the raid.
[4:14:08] Tophwow: @ferzerp PI is bad design too
[4:14:16] Totteman: Why do you have less fun because someone has more fun? is it the same way for you when you do activites IRL?
[4:14:28] big_hero_d: @Synk_live current game designe is not siuted for warrior, it luck utility not the dmg, lets hope for warrior rework soon
[4:14:34] korean_baj: hes having 10% more fun than me!!!!
[4:14:55] Binek123: stop making this game for 1% and focus on 99%! when will blizzard realize that?
[4:15:13] TiPera: @Binek123 they just don't care mate, it is what it is D:
[4:15:28] TotallyNotRaien: im the wild card player who likes to collect only pets
[4:15:35] Tophwow: @Totteman if you play football with friends and a team just randomly gets 2 goals instead of 1 then the other team would for sure be angry
[4:15:36] StreamElements: For Highlights, fun content and guides, remember to subscribe to my youtube channel -> https://www.youtube.com/naguura
[4:15:44] Tophwow: and some of the people in the same team as well for sure
[4:16:01] Binek123: @TiPera true but at the end of the day , it is all about money so they need to please/focus majority not MINORITY
[4:16:02] Raggu2: @Binek123 What. Its easier than ever to get quality gear. Easier than ever to clear raids, easier ever to pvp, easier than ever to do m+.
[4:16:34] Totteman: @Tophwow Its more like if you play fotball with your friends and the other team has better equipment
[4:16:41] Pokket_Gaming: I think the real issue is it's a split between people want to play WoW as an RPG and people who play WoW competitively.
[4:16:49] Raggu2: Wow honestly cant get much easier unless it starts palying for you, which is kinda follower dungeons tbh.
[4:16:52] big_hero_d: Lets put the same ability for each spec just with different name and animations xD
[4:17:06] Tophwow: @Totteman You can make it whatever you want its less fun for the people on the weaker side
[4:17:10] big_hero_d: but each hit will hit for 1 dmg xD and mobs will have like 10 hp xD
[4:17:23] AceReformed: @Raggu2 It might be "Easier" to que pvp (Because of shuffle) but the quality has been drastically decreased
[4:17:33] TotallyNotRaien: unsolvable issues is my drag name
[4:17:43] korean_baj: but all would benefit from more rewards from m+

[4:18:09] Neztea: pls dont forget battle pets...
[4:18:28] AceReformed: @Raggu2 Accessibility in pvp's case is not good if it detoriates the quality tho monkaHmm
[4:18:47] AceReformed: So actually, no pvp is not a great state, and it has been better in the past
[4:18:59] AceReformed: Now ofcourse, PvP KEKW
[4:19:13] Raggu2: @AceReformed yea sure. but in the apst there wasnt base pvp gear. You can go make a set of green items right now that boost you to 90% of your potential in pvp.
[4:19:26] VerityNS: Druidherbalist dont need items KEKW
[4:19:26] Raggu2: Its the easiest its ever been to get into pvp right now./
[4:19:53] big_hero_d: @AceReformed @Raggu2  Maxim made a podcast with Venruki about PVP curent situation its very accurate check it out
[4:19:54] Totteman: @Tophwow I would say that things not being 100% balanced is what makes it fun! Theres nothing that prevents you from clearing the raid get best gear on a class that isnt the strongest atm
[4:19:59] Jarettol: they just need to nerf dh for pvp, lol\
[4:20:06] StreamElements: Join Naguura on her journey to become the most casual of transmog farmers! Goth Naguura AKA “Nagothica” has been challenged to farm a goth transmog for her character and will be wearing a goth transmog IRL to match! Guidelines are posted in the #Nagothica channel of Naguura’s Discord. Date TBD. Check out the wish list for the event -> https://throne.com/naguura/collections/nagothika
[4:20:24] plaguedot: i think we need wow police as well,to check if our account is nerfed,just ebcause after 20 dungeons still get no loot haha naguuraHypers
[4:20:41] plaguedot: hahah
[4:20:46] plaguedot: joke
[4:21:06] Byggareebob: on the tuning parr i think letting echo and liquid play a harder boss is fine but they NEED to nerf the bosses alot faster. TIndral was unkillable for most guilds for way way to long multiple weeks porb
[4:21:07] Tophwow: @Totteman there are alot of things that prevent people from clearing the raid and its not the legendary thats for sure
[4:21:12] boyzbee: If raids are tuned for rank 1 guilds to finish fights with one DPS left how can you balance classes and their legendaries
[4:21:14] korean_baj: rating tied rewards
[4:21:31] Tophwow: @boyzbee When were raids ever designed that way
[4:21:37] Totteman: @Tophwow It ok that theres and ebb and flow to the power and balancing of the game, how  boring it would be if everyone did the same amount of dmg etc
[4:22:06] Tophwow: @Totteman Yes that is true but its just frustrating if there are outliers that arent related to player skill
[4:22:07] criptos: just ahead of time say "2 weeks after world first kill it gets nerfed"
[4:22:08] TotallyNotRaien: why would it be bad for the guilds on the boss?
[4:22:11] TotallyNotRaien: dont they want to kill it
[4:22:11] Pokket_Gaming: Or just make a good boss so it never needs to be nerfed.
[4:22:17] criptos: if guilds want to prove themselves and kill before they can
[4:22:20] Tophwow: @Totteman And thats the case for alot of players
[4:22:24] Wigglerr: The optional ICC buff was decent for the time
[4:22:26] boyzbee: @tophwow if fights are tuned for the best guilds to struggle how can classes without the extra 10% to even play
[4:22:30] Shrugal: Shouldn't this be solved by gear progression?
[4:22:30] korean_baj: if there was any sort of structure to how they nerfed things it may be easier
[4:22:38] spirantsix: Just stop making the game around no lifers and make it for the average players!
[4:22:44] TotallyNotRaien: rwf can eat shit lol
[4:22:47] Tophwow: @boyzbee Yes but fights are never tuned for the best guilds when the weaker guilds get there
[4:22:55] hitzocrunk: @spirantsix the average player doesnt raid mythic
[4:22:57] AceReformed: @Raggu2 Ehh no actually that is wrong too bro, legion and WoD had templates, meaning gear did not matter at all KEKW
[4:23:22] Totteman: @Tophwow My point exactly, most players like 99,90% will never expect to get the legendary and when they see a player with it they will be amazed instead of feeling envy
[4:23:31] Raggu2: @AceReformed ilvl had a huge impact on your template. They changed how much of an impact fairly late into that system but it still had an impact.
[4:23:33] Pokket_Gaming: A boss shouldn't be nerfed. It should be overcome by increase gear and experience.
[4:23:42] spirantsix: @hitzocrunk  ya so who cares about it. This game is being built around no lifers and its destroying the game
[4:23:52] Tophwow: @Totteman Nah more people than you think will feel envy
[4:24:17] JohnAllenCasts: as someone who was on 14% best pull on tindral when latest nerfs came in, it was kind of a bummer when we killed it 3rd pull after nerf. But that's not because i care so much about world ranking though, just couldn't feel like I did the harder version of the boss
[4:24:17] Tophwow: @Totteman But thats a problem with the people not the game, but the game designers have to design around that
[4:24:47] Totteman: @Tophwow then maybe thats a problem for those highend people if the extreme majority doesnt then the game shouldnt be designed for the 0.1%
[4:24:51] ardentzeal: there should just be an extra difficulty option in for rwf, capped ilvl, really hard, starts at same time, same loot as mythic. then you can do flex mythic and make it easier to start, no or at least less boss nerfing needed anymore
[4:24:56] rinma1: same with prenerf tindral
[4:25:00] Kobaaya: they would still prog on it
[4:25:01] Tophwow: I doubt a world 200 guild would even be able to do halondrus pre-nerf
[4:25:03] Neztea: didnt nelth and tindral killed a bunch of guilds
[4:25:08] criptos: They are tuning them insanely hard to the point they had to actively tune tindral and fyrakk as they progressed them in the RWF. If they are that hard, nerf them shortly after the world first kill. say 2 or 3 resets after. If you want to push and prove your guild you can otherwise if you don't think you can or won't you can wait for the 3rd week
[4:25:10] grillat: kungen solod it
[4:25:11] Pokket_Gaming: But does it need to be that hard?
[4:25:12] criptos: /shrug
[4:25:24] hitzocrunk: @spirantsix unbelievable cringe take
[4:25:26] pandaa__03: facts
[4:25:36] StreamElements: For Highlights, fun content and guides, remember to subscribe to my youtube channel -> https://www.youtube.com/naguura
[4:25:46] spirantsix: @hitzocrunk  your just clueless if that is what you think
[4:25:47] Tophwow: @Totteman Yes but I am saying that exactly its not just 0.1% that would feel envious, its way more than that, I would even go as far as to saying that more people would be envious than amazed
[4:25:56] boyzbee: Fight nerfed to allow the best guilds to pass because they are to hard doesn't exactly balance the game
[4:26:19] criptos: Oh ya someones gonna be pissed, but if they at least communicate a hard date BEFORE release of the raid
[4:26:25] criptos: it's better then just randomly picking a week
[4:26:27] Jothor83: there is not easy solution , some will get affected it sucks, only thing they can do is try to affect as less ppl as they can
[4:26:33] rinma1: they always do harder nerfs when hof is closed
[4:26:35] MarkElf2204: It's a number at the end of the day, not that big of a deal
[4:26:40] korean_baj: cant please everyone people are going to get fucked over no matter what
[4:27:13] Pandho: but is it ok to just ignore a very small amount of players?
[4:27:14] criptos: Why not? before the raid releases say 2-3 resets after WF kill we are going to nerf it to a more reasonable level since they know it's going to happen eventually
[4:27:18] criptos: iono just a thought
[4:27:54] Fausstty: Hey Caro, good day
[4:27:56] Tophwow: @criptos They do that, they nerf everything when Hall of fame is full
[4:28:03] Xenomshox: can some1 link dat post?
[4:28:06] StreamElements: If you enjoy the stream make sure to check naguura out on her Socials : https://twitter.com/Naguura // https://www.youtube.com/naguura // https://www.instagram.com/naguura // tiktok.com/@naguura
[4:28:26] Tophwow: They literally do the nerfing at a specific time with hall of fame
[4:28:30] korean_baj: they would probably know when to nerf it if they actually progged the boss themselves LUL
[4:28:36] boyzbee: It makes sense if they haven't scaled their legendaries
[4:28:53] criptos: @Tophwow ya but it's also not the first nerf for most bosses, just the biggest a lot of times.
[4:29:23] Tophwow: @criptos Yes but how exactly would you want to realize anything else
[4:29:47] criptos: I mean the healthiest solution for the game would be to stop designing them for the RWF guilds at all. But they'll never do that
[4:29:50] criptos: imo
[4:30:00] Tophwow: Also, all of those nerfs literally only affect like 5% of the playerbase max
[4:30:11] Bleak07: Cheergi Nessie Cheergi
[4:30:15] Tophwow: @criptos Why, its not like other content is losing out
[4:30:25] rottisxd: anduin would have been way harder in world 1st race if the p3 stars would have worked
[4:30:41] korean_baj: its not unreasonable
[4:30:46] Totteman: @Tophwow I disagree, also theres a diffrence between being envious and feeling like it would be really cool to have the item too? it really only 1% that ever clears the mythic raid and 0.1% of the classes can use the legendary item? so i would say people who dont expect to get the item arent jelous that they dont have it?
[4:30:52] hitzocrunk: @spirantsix the game is so casual friendly right now. a lot of players enjoy mythic raiding and the average player doesnt need the best gear from mythic raiding for their weekly keys and transmog runs
[4:30:53] Pokket_Gaming: Why is it a bad thing if ATDH dropped in it's current state? At this point just make M+ Raiding if you want raids to be incredibly difficult.
[4:30:54] insomain: Make bots XD
[4:30:57] MarkElf2204: Blizzard makes plenty of money to do it if they wanted to
[4:30:58] TotallyNotRaien: people wonder why an update wont come out, meanwhile theres a dev RWF
[4:31:01] Raggu2: A finished boss btw, out of testing.
[4:31:06] Blabyone: i eated pizza today =D
[4:31:13] korean_baj: oh wow they would have to do work!
[4:31:20] Tophwow: @Totteman Most people expect to get anything they want in a game
[4:31:21] Plokoon100: They should play thier own game :D
[4:31:23] JohnAllenCasts: just hire a 100 person mythic raid squad
[4:31:25] Kobaaya: employ "washed" out raiders
[4:31:31] Raggu2: With a support staff
[4:31:36] Orgabism: Wow, extra money spent by Blizz....no no, better fire everyone :)
[4:31:51] korean_baj: forever because the boss is TOO HARD?
[4:31:54] Jothor83: would be cool tho imagine getting payed overtime to "test" bosses LUL
[4:31:57] Neztea: hence why we are the testers :)
[4:31:58] chillknightswithwife: if devs arnt willing to listen to the community then they should face it themselves to see the boss needs nerfed! same in pvp atm! Pvp community is crying out about inflation and bots but nothing is done, come see what its like and it will be fixed in a day :p
[4:31:59] Totteman: @Tophwow I really disagree, most people dont expect to get anything they want in game without doing the content that drops it
[4:32:00] TotallyNotRaien: besides its not in their job description to do player things
[4:32:30] Tophwow: @Totteman Oh so most people expect to get what they want if they do the content
[4:32:31] Raggu2: Assuming the boss is finished. if something changes the testing is all moot.
[4:32:37] korean_baj: its reasonable they have plenty of time and money
[4:32:53] JohnAllenCasts: then 1 change gets made and they have to start again
[4:32:59] showerbees: asmongold thinks this post is great
[4:33:00] korean_baj: they basically are
[4:33:07] TotallyNotRaien: nevermind progging i would love to see what wa devs would come up with
[4:33:09] Totteman: @Tophwow So how many people are raiding mythic then? and how many of those are killing the last boss mythic more then a couple of times?
[4:33:18] Blabyone: what are you eated today chat? =D
[4:33:25] Juanshotts: people dont understand that throwing money at a problem does not reduce the time issue
[4:33:30] TotallyNotRaien: today i eated lettuce and chicken
[4:33:32] Jothor83: they already work 12 hours per day to make sure the content is out on time , and there are still problems .... add the test bosses time .... well that would take forever
[4:33:33] chillknightswithwife: id be happy if they just fix the bot situation! its out of control!
[4:33:45] Tophwow: @Totteman Last boss mythic is probably like 2% of the playerbase
[4:33:55] Neztea: @TotallyNotRaien lmao
[4:34:02] Totteman: @Tophwow And how many of those 2% can actually use the legendary item?
[4:34:19] Hey_I_am_Clara: 11 raiders from Hey_I_am_Clara have joined! 
[4:34:21] showerbees: “I want a race in which no one is challenged so that everyone can kill the boss
[4:34:27] chillknightswithwife: i know a booster that boosts pppl through m+ using a bot alone! legit paying a bot to boost you through mythics is insane
[4:34:31] Tophwow: @Totteman About 1/6th?
[4:34:45] TotallyNotRaien: didnt you know? devs are hivemind, what one learns they all learn
[4:34:51] The_Reemer: @chillknightswithwife i also enjoy spreading misinformation
[4:34:52] JohnAllenCasts: just hire echo and liquid ez
[4:34:52] insomain: They can do things that players can't though. Set their own health to 2m, test individual mechanics, have bots play their rotations etc...
[4:34:52] Hedylamarr_: Hedylamarr_ subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 20 months! 
[4:34:53] Totteman: @Tophwow So we balance for 0.3% of the players then? that sounds wrong
[4:34:57] Kuroz: naguuraLove naguuraLove naguuraLove
[4:35:11] chillknightswithwife: bots should not be in the game!
[4:35:13] Tophwow: @Totteman No, anyone can get the legendary through heroic and normal
[4:35:21] Tophwow: @Totteman You dont have to do mythic to get the legendary
[4:35:27] maalcromlol: "would be against the law, i guess.." KEKW
[4:35:36] insomain: Yeah that's insane XD
[4:35:36] StreamElements: For Highlights, fun content and guides, remember to subscribe to my youtube channel -> https://www.youtube.com/naguura
[4:35:46] AnitaGrnKard: @Naguura your chat is the exact reason Blizz should never ask the community what they want LOL
[4:35:47] Tophwow: @Totteman The number of people who have the legendary is alot higher than the amount of people who have killed fyrakk
[4:35:52] Kobaaya: and they testing them with straight strats no min maxing
[4:36:09] showerbees: I think that it could work it would just be hugely inefficient
[4:36:28] Totteman: @Tophwow Ok didnt know people could get it from heroic etc... I say make it drop from mythic last boss only and problem solved
[4:36:31] Jothor83: @AnitaGrnKard yes and again YES
[4:36:32] Byggareebob: you think they tried 3 seconds seed? how many time did they make it Kappa
[4:36:35] Vtal: idk how can anyone defend the state of the game for the past years, the game is souless and impenetrable for new players
[4:36:45] Tophwow: @Totteman Then people would be mad
[4:36:53] Fausstty: I don't know what you guys are talking about because I'm late but I disagree completely with everything you guys say Kappa
[4:36:58] Stricken79: @Totteman that's fucked, fuck elitists
[4:37:07] VerityNS: Naguura do you know if Blizzard have ever hired any of the previous WFraiders that have "retired" to their QA teams?
[4:37:29] rinma1: true
[4:37:30] Hedylamarr_: this last raid was a banger
[4:37:31] Tophwow: There is no game that designs better boss fights than wow
[4:37:31] Totteman: @Tophwow Why would they be mad? if you get the item you have already cleared the hardest content so the only thing you get from playing with the item is fun? theres nothing harder that needs clearing
[4:37:39] TotallyNotRaien: people have no concept of budget, man hours and worker rights and are being truly unreasonable
[4:37:54] criptos: Tindral is straight bad
[4:37:59] Tophwow: @Totteman Because people who dont do last boss and play the class that has the legendary will be angry that they cant get it
[4:38:06] StreamElements: If you enjoy the stream make sure to check naguura out on her Socials : https://twitter.com/Naguura // https://www.youtube.com/naguura // https://www.instagram.com/naguura // tiktok.com/@naguura
[4:38:07] Kobaaya: last 2-3 raids are miles above ones before
[4:38:19] hitzocrunk: @criptos Tindral was really fun boss before the nerfs that gutted him
[4:38:37] korean_baj: ever since they moved away from "stop damage" timings its been better yes
[4:38:39] Kobaaya: hope they keep it up  on this path of design
[4:38:39] Shrugal: I think we need some kind of systemic automatic nerfing system. Like gear progression but smarter and more adaptive.
[4:38:42] criptos: In a vacuum, walking in and 1 shotting the fight it's a fun encounter but progging it is a nightmare
[4:39:04] Tophwow: @Shrugal You cant realize that
[4:39:04] Hedylamarr_: I love tindral
[4:39:05] tuchulu: Good morning chatchan
[4:39:06] Jothor83: its clear you cant plz everyone no matter what
[4:39:17] Tophwow: No automatic at least
[4:39:32] Totteman: @Tophwow Then join a mythic raid and do the work? sounds like LFR mentality. I really think that giving everyone everything is what has ruined this game
[4:39:35] Tophwow: Smart system yes, automatic no
[4:39:40] Byggareebob: in our extreme scenario we had 400 pulls on both tindral and fyrakk and after nerfs they both got 1 shot. not even 2 pulls bad feeling
[4:40:18] tuchulu: whos the blue haired hottie in the loading screen i mightcheck out retail awooga
[4:40:20] VerityNS: Couldnt it work like they had in ICC? a progressive buff that increase every week?
[4:40:25] Tophwow: @Totteman I mean I am clearing everything and I personally agree with you but 90% of the playerbase does not
[4:40:25] chillknightswithwife: the bosses are built for the top 1% so naturally should be nerfed once its clear what the road blocks are to normal mythic raiding guilds
[4:40:51] rinma1: isnt mythic "hard" mode
[4:41:01] Jothor83: fk i am out of pop corn brb
[4:41:01] Stricken79: I'm happy I got my leggo, if you were to say that I don't deserve it because I'm not in the 13% (and even less for strength classes who can loot weapon) that kill mythic fyrakk then you are part of a increasing problem that seperates the best players from the worst NODDERS
[4:41:01] Totteman: @Tophwow I feel like 90% of te playerbase doesnt care, or even 95%+
[4:41:04] korean_baj: but how long before the "hard mode" difficult becomes mandatory? for competitive players
[4:41:17] ItsYent: my opinion is keep the tuning the same for the first month for the Race after the race Nerf it hard, if anybody still is struggling they are just bad and dont deserve to get the kills
[4:41:20] korean_baj: it would for some guild recruitment
[4:41:24] Tophwow: @chillknightswithwife But mythic raiding guilds in itself are like maybe 10% of players, which is already a minority in the broad of the game, which means you shouldnt make raids at all?
[4:41:45] kadashy1: could give hall of fame to guilds who do those kind of challenges
[4:41:50] IVANallcaps: The tindral nerf was out of this world, we went from being on 40-50% pulls to killing it within an hour the first night
[4:41:50] korean_baj: it will end up slowly just becoming the "new normal" for end difficulty
[4:42:02] Kobaaya: im saying move bosses ai out of scripted schematics  to adopt on the fly with raid its faced against but thats some SF dream :)
[4:42:03] korean_baj: effectively adding another difficulty for player burnout
[4:42:06] Tophwow: People saying content designed for top 1% is bad forget that they are part of maybe the top 10% which is already a minority
[4:42:08] showerbees: people would hate that shit
[4:42:11] criptos: @IVANallcaps the 10% hp nerf?
[4:42:12] Vtal: whats the point of nerfing mythic dif over and over and still giving CE to lower mythic guilds?
[4:42:21] IVANallcaps: nah the one before the latest nerf
[4:42:24] theskot: its an RPG game, people play for gear
[4:42:26] TotallyNotRaien: a lot of people wouldnt raid at all if it wasnt for items
[4:42:30] VerityNS: MOST people raid beause of loot yeah
[4:42:37] chillknightswithwife: def not! but when the mythic raid comes out it is coming out for the top 1% in mind, the top 1% cant compare to the top 10%
[4:42:37] Camelbak21: I feel like the top 0.001 aka the top 3-5 guilds in the world is holding blizzard hostage saying they would all quit if they made it "easier"
[4:42:41] korean_baj: you underestimate the competitiveness in mythic raiding
[4:42:43] ItsYent: the thing is they are designing Mythic Raiding for the top 1% therefore the top 1% deserve to kill it not the 99% of the playerbase
[4:42:50] gmike66: the people who dont raid do cosmetic things in the game lol
[4:42:51] hitzocrunk: but then the mount farmers would whine and scream, remeber the kazzara mount was gonna be mythic only
[4:42:55] criptos: @Vtal because even the current forms of tindral and fyrakk mythic are still WAY WAY too hard for 99% of the playerbase
[4:43:01] Panaxx: why is mage tower so popular then
[4:43:12] Fabsst: !song
[4:43:13] StreamElements: Current Song: VINAI, John De Sohn, Lucas Estrada - Ghost Town (Lucas Estrada Remix)
[4:43:14] wiffysniff: when mage tower came back it popped off for sure
[4:43:24] IVANallcaps: IMO the way it works now is fine - big guilds kill it, they leave it un-nerfed for a while to let other people get that sense of achievment, then nerf it, then wait some more, nerf again - what's the big issue?
[4:43:27] ItsYent: @Panaxx never once done the mage tower once i got my tmog
[4:43:28] korean_baj: its not a problem i didnt say that i just said it may become a problem when it slowly becomes the "standard"
[4:43:35] Tophwow: @criptos Why is that a bad thing though?
[4:43:36] IVANallcaps: Always people who cry that they want to do mythic but it's soooo hard it's impossible.. get better?
[4:43:37] Vtal: @criptos so what? isnt that the whole point of mythic? be hard af?
[4:44:05] Vtal: @criptos you shouldnt assume everyone that raids "mythic" is gonna be able to do it
[4:44:06] chillknightswithwife: i think hard mode is a great idea! RWF can activate hard mode and everyone else gets the basic version
[4:44:07] criptos: @Tophwow I didn't say it was, I was just saying giving people that kill it now after the nerfs CE is still fair
[4:44:11] criptos: it's still a hard fight
[4:44:24] DrBazingaSC: there is no mythic raid only loot... I can get everything by upgrading hc gear?
[4:44:42] Byggareebob: ye mythic+ drops same ilvl as tindral
[4:44:46] Byggareebob: m+ 18 vault :)
[4:44:54] Tophwow: @criptos Yeh, I wasnt trying to attack you, I just wanted to spike the conversation and was interrested in possible responses
[4:45:07] ItsYent: Blizzard has already came up with the solution with the vault. the players who are either bad and cant do mythic raid or can't committ to a good guild they can do vault and get 1 piece of BIS loot a week
[4:45:29] Tophwow: @ItsYent They cant, its too rng heavy
[4:45:30] cesartcab: @Byggareebob there are specific items u want from raid , weapons , trinkets , some gear with stats balance .
[4:45:35] Shrugal: But wouldn't guilds min-max this again? Like running no hard mode only on the first week to maximize mythic loot.
[4:45:36] StreamElements: For Highlights, fun content and guides, remember to subscribe to my youtube channel -> https://www.youtube.com/naguura
[4:45:52] ItsYent: @Tophwow so is going in mythic raid and killing a boss and splitting a piece of loot with 19 others
[4:45:54] Tophwow: @Shrugal Yes ofc, top guilds will use anything they can get to be on top
[4:45:55] Hedylamarr_: i like the hard mode idea. It also allows time-restricted players to experience the boss the way RWF guilds did
[4:46:03] IVANallcaps: So what do you expect they are going to do? Make the boss fights so easy that every can do it? I'm confused
[4:46:06] TotallyNotRaien: the way boosters would thrive if hm was cosmetics only
[4:46:07] DrBazingaSC: only thing I only get from mythic raid is an ach right?
[4:46:16] xenrelay: it is perfectly logical that "hardmoe" is "world first mode"   every one else do the less hard ting and the nerfes are then deleted.
[4:46:29] ItsYent: sounds like people want mythic raid to basically be heroic difficulty and there be no achievement in doing it
[4:46:33] Tophwow: @ItsYent That is true, I am not a fan of very rare items either. In the end it all depends on how high the possibility is
[4:46:40] JohnAllenCasts: also thats the prenerf state?
[4:46:43] IVANallcaps: Yeah just get good really lmao
[4:47:16] Tophwow: @ItsYent But why do people want that, thats just less content overall
[4:47:18] IVANallcaps: the "hard mode" is Mythic wdymmmmmmm
[4:47:19] Deenial: Hmm
[4:47:25] criptos: @Naguura This is probably going to be shit on by everyone in chat, but what if mythic was tuned not as extreme, but guilds had to choose a difficulty for the week. Like you can do heroic or mythic and that's it. So they can't do infinite splits and gear up to 480 before gnarlroot mythic dies
[4:47:32] ItsYent: @Tophwow true all they need to do is implement like dinar as a resouce you can pick from the vault so they can target raid gear if they dont want the myth gear from m+
[4:47:35] Shrugal: Yea but if they don't ...
[4:47:54] Tophwow: @ItsYent Imagine spending 12 coins and you can upgrade a hc item to 489

[4:48:07] korean_baj: that hardmode difficulty would probably hurt the rwf too which would hurt the marketing value
[4:48:08] big_hero_d: what about extra bosses on M diff like in Cataclysm HC Sinestra
[4:48:17] xenrelay: it would be a gamble and a half not to do it hm
[4:48:22] Shrugal: If they don't then the winning strategy might turn out to be 1st week no hard mode :/
[4:48:23] Tophwow: @criptos If hey do that then every guild does 10 chars and just uses best geared char
[4:48:29] Tophwow: (they already do that)
[4:48:31] DrBazingaSC: can I then kill second boss in hard mode, if I only killed the first boss without hard mode?
[4:48:38] Byggareebob: bring back heroic week
[4:48:49] IVANallcaps: this argument is something I'm not casual enough to understand lmao
[4:48:54] criptos: @Naguura I would think JUST for the RWF honestly not even the general playerbase
[4:48:58] Kobaaya: how bout limited attempts on boss :)
[4:49:21] Kobaaya: for last 2 bosses
[4:49:21] BasVanDerWerff: @Kobaaya that is horrible
[4:49:23] Tophwow: @criptos Even RWF would play if they got something like a tournament realm where they could compete on fair grounds
[4:49:34] Stricken79: nezRave
[4:49:41] Tophwow: @criptos in fact multiple people out of those guilds have said that they would love something like that
[4:49:45] ItsUrBuddyJake: Man your hand writing is beautiful
[4:49:52] Kobaaya: @BasVanDerWerff  why it worked before
[4:50:04] BasVanDerWerff: @Kobaaya no it didnt work
[4:50:06] StreamElements: Join Naguura on her journey to become the most casual of transmog farmers! Goth Naguura AKA “Nagothica” has been challenged to farm a goth transmog for her character and will be wearing a goth transmog IRL to match! Guidelines are posted in the #Nagothica channel of Naguura’s Discord. Date TBD. Check out the wish list for the event -> https://throne.com/naguura/collections/nagothika
[4:50:28] kadashy1: I think they should just make an event like MDI for raiding and leave the current raid tuning out of that level of play
[4:50:46] Sikari__: @Kobaaya it just makes no sense from blizzard's pov. bc it would hard limit players time in the game essentially
[4:50:50] medodruja: amazing hand writing XD
[4:50:54] criptos: @Naguura I should have been clearer I just meant for the RWF. Not every guild, just so they didn't have to tune bosses so hard, and get rid of the splits maybe
[4:50:57] Tophwow: @kadashy1 I personally would not like that because my guild is in the spot between that
[4:51:04] maalcromlol: @StreamElements wooo goth stream? cant wait haha
[4:51:06] Fausstty: I didn't understand it but I liked the graph
[4:51:13] Camelbak21: That's not how hardmode works, hardmodes are enabled during say "heroic mode" to turn it into "hardmode" kinda
[4:51:14] ItsUrBuddyJake: Where'd you learn how to mouse write like that?! Id like to learn too!
[4:51:16] Fausstty: Pepega
[4:51:28] ItsYent: I think the game is in a good spot when we start knitpicking about shit like this lol
[4:51:41] Camelbak21: So if you can't do hardmode you can just kill it in "heroic"
[4:51:48] TotallyNotRaien: lock it for the first 1-2 weeks?
[4:51:57] Cellastria: heya naguura!
[4:52:00] big_hero_d: put RWF to Turnament serwer xD
[4:52:07] Shrugal: I like that people would have to make the decision themselves, its an element of strategy, But they don't have enough information to make a good decision, because it isn't known how hard some bosses will be.
[4:52:16] criptos: I'm sure they could figure out a way to lock them out of the other or use tournament realms
[4:52:20] criptos: just spit ballin
[4:52:50] korean_baj: all of this just for the sake of trying to keep people playing the game forever instead of taking a break
[4:52:52] BasVanDerWerff: why is there a ned to change anything they nerf the hard bosses after a few weeks and non RWF guilds can kill the bosses
[4:53:04] evrynameistkn: Outside of trinkets loot in the game feels pretty good
[4:53:09] TotallyNotRaien: how bout lock just gear? and leave it open to try and prog the fights
[4:53:39] Camelbak21: You would have to think about gearing differently, you can't apply the same gearing methods as on live in a hardmode scenario
[4:54:01] Tophwow: wanna build a group, I have a 29 throne xd
[4:54:07] Gaz_Games_: I think a set nerf date after RWF has been decided would work, say 4th reset after the RWF has been won
[4:54:17] Fausstty: DinoDance
[4:54:56] TotallyNotRaien: your brain is finally growing
[4:54:58] criptos: @Gaz_Games_ that's what I suggested early, 2-3 weeks but ya just communicate clearly before hand when it's gonna get nerfed
[4:54:59] Kuroz: that would help
[4:55:05] Kuroz: hmmMeeting
[4:55:07] korean_baj: thats pretty normal for boomkin mains

[4:55:37] Gaz_Games_: @criptos and they should be clear about it like it's 5/10/15% of boss HP and 10% damage nerf or something, nice clear and agreed upon, depending on progress after the RWF
[4:57:17] Jothor83: all the talk about wow mythic raiding and here i am w8ing for Horizon Forbiden West for PC .... 1st world probs LUL

[5:08:10] Cellastria: kings rest was pretty bad and sometimes underrot
[5:08:15] korean_baj: because they save money not making new dungeons
[5:08:15] TotallyNotRaien: they do make dungeon
[5:08:23] Xevenna: I didnt really like it in bfa, wasnt used to small hallways then.  Then weve had much worse since then so i think this time around it doesnt seem as bad.
[5:08:26] jbenson444: new dungeons = a trillion mechanics
[5:08:35] evrynameistkn: Updated waycrest is dope
[5:08:40] razzzz6: they should make next season only iron docks
[5:08:43] razzzz6: i would love it
[5:08:46] ophencie_bdo: reclycling content typical dev
[5:08:46] Madve: Hi Naguura
[5:09:13] Madve: Just chillin, gonna make some dinner soon. how are you?
[5:09:14] razzzz6: actually a fan voted season would be awesome for fated
[5:09:15] bmxinfos: hi name music?
[5:09:20] Kuroz: !song
[5:09:21] StreamElements: Current Song: Wuki - Sunshine (My Girl)
[5:09:23] love_eggplant: some people never played older dungeons, it's nice for them
[5:09:36] korean_baj: you a big fan of fated raids then?
[5:09:44] jbenson444: they made changes, it's not like they just slapped BFA Waycrest into DF
[5:09:55] Hedylamarr_: I really like Waycrest. I feel like it is a properly challenging dungeon in a fun way. I hate Rise because there are too many mechanics that just unavoidably kill you
[5:10:02] love_eggplant: fated raids are something else, now that IS very lazy
[5:10:03] Jacksprat47: the art team's still working on something
[5:10:05] ophencie_bdo: im just saying we pay 15$ a month to play this game and they have billion behind them LUL
[5:10:10] TotallyNotRaien: they made around the same amount of new dungeons as past expacs
[5:10:11] ophencie_bdo: but i get what u saying
[5:10:49] Kobaaya: its easyer to rescale dung then construct new working one
[5:10:53] Jacksprat47: yall acting like money just solves problems lol
[5:11:00] voyage_icarus: @bigballsack33 they do.
[5:11:01] love_eggplant: @bigballsack33 once they release dragonflight, they are not working on it anymore. they are already on a new expansion
[5:11:18] Gaz_Games_: @Jacksprat47 it would solve 99% of my problems lol
[5:11:31] voyage_icarus: @lucky_therarest oh god caverns would be so long
[5:12:03] TotallyNotRaien: those people are like walleyed or something, they see the recycled dungeons but never look at the new dungeons they made
[5:12:03] Kobaaya: there is "old" content that is way better then some new untested shit
[5:12:21] ophencie_bdo: another big CEO getting paid too much LUL
[5:12:36] Thadelus: you act like they are some small indie company
[5:12:46] love_eggplant: they are
[5:12:49] Xevenna: i like that they reuse content as long as its not all re-used. gives them time to focus on the new stuff.
[5:12:50] love_eggplant: with sex offenders
[5:12:53] Jacksprat47: "just make good content lol" isn't an argument when basically every other mmo is either worse or has different issues
[5:12:55] love_eggplant: indie sex offending company
[5:13:09] juanmrbbnero: lets not fool ourselves most of the money from subscriptions is probably not going to developers etc but just profit, like they make so much money
[5:13:14] TotallyNotRaien: more cooks in the kitchen doesnt always work
[5:13:25] korean_baj: more money means less original content and more yachts for ceos
[5:13:37] TotallyNotRaien: wow a company makes profits. more revelations at eleven
[5:13:46] love_eggplant: @Naguura instead they threw away money on unannounced games that took billions ^-^
[5:13:57] ophencie_bdo: @Naguura what would you do if u were 460 item lvl with no guild , no friend and just cameback to WoW
[5:14:29] Kuroz: HUH
[5:14:36] korean_baj: recycled content as a replacement for original content is bullshit but recycled content can be done correctly
[5:14:42] Skyc0: Make an educational video on Caro, then you can just link that to them when this inevitably comes up again.  xd
[5:14:50] TiPera: @ophencie_bdo getting a guild should be easy bro, just apply and find new players to play with
[5:14:52] ItsUrBuddyJake: @ophencie_bdo find a guild you fit in with. Get into heroic raid and mythic+ if you are looking for that kind of content
[5:14:56] Thadelus: it should be a bonus not a replacement
[5:15:04] lovesthebox: ive enjoyed doing wcm, brh and dht again tbh. its been fun
[5:15:12] love_eggplant: their wow dev team is over 1000 people
[5:15:13] voyage_icarus: @ophencie_bdo turn it down off lol. there’s still time for you to escape before it sucks you in for 6 months
[5:15:16] love_eggplant: they are slow and bad

[5:15:44] cuck_norris__: time is money
[5:16:01] xenrelay: that sucked
[5:16:12] BasVanDerWerff: but now you play dungeons you allready played for a whole expansion allready again
[5:16:13] kathsukii: Classic. caster playing 1 handed KEKW
[5:16:16] johnwickdamere545: is this true that thy gonna bring back dragonflight dungeons for new season?
[5:16:46] juanmrbbnero: but who says that?
[5:16:57] juanmrbbnero: never see anybody say that
[5:16:59] kathsukii: @bigballsack33 nice name KEKW
[5:17:03] love_eggplant: it takes them 2 years to make 8 new dungeons
[5:17:05] love_eggplant: XDD
[5:17:19] korean_baj: i hated doing legion dungeons the entire expansion! *does legion dungeons in DF*
[5:17:44] Jacksprat47: @love_eggplant how quickly do you think you can design, implement and test a new dungeon?
[5:17:52] shneeki_tv: Watching you do a +27 with one hand while talking about other stuff is not hurting my ego at all :L It actually looks like you're playing in slow motion or something
[5:17:55] love_eggplant: @Jacksprat47 pretty easily with a 1000 dev team
[5:17:55] Bareno: how about option #3, blizzard/activision needs to stop being greedy and hire more developers COPIUM
[5:17:57] Philaeux: they may have a different opinion, but in that case, they are wrong
[5:18:03] love_eggplant: and a full QA team behind you.
[5:18:04] Petromnikus: Yeah i agree only thing i would change is for the first season to only have the new ones instead of half old ones

[5:18:25] Jacksprat47: @love_eggplant ah yes all those 1000 are totally devs and not admin, management, art, marketing, support, etc
[5:18:32] love_eggplant: @Jacksprat47 i specifically said dev team
[5:18:33] xenrelay: moonkin is a 1 hand class everyone knows this  kekw
[5:18:50] TotallyNotRaien: oh so its just a "feeling" got it, so nothing
[5:19:03] veldhei: veldhei subscribed with Prime. 
[5:19:14] Loyaliz_: it sounds like you have to choose between worse and worst, tbh they gave up the game and trying to get as much as possible with the minimal effort to run the game and its community. its profit drilled

[5:20:13] shneeki_tv: How do you deal with afflicted as boomy?  Are you dispelling them or something?
[5:20:16] lovesthebox: also u dont know how many ppl are playing different versions of the game
[5:20:21] big_hero_d: well a lot of ppl did all they want on patch just waiting for next one
[5:20:22] korean_baj: well it would help sub numbers if instead of fated they released original raid content
[5:20:27] amphila87: you also have wotlk, era & discovery competing for wow players
[5:20:31] Bareno: yep about 20% of my guild is MIA
[5:21:21] korean_baj: if it was a massive success wouldnt they be bragging about that though?
[5:21:28] Philaeux: game has never been that good
[5:21:30] BizBichou: pretty sure they said dragonflight has been a success
[5:21:42] Zeltiix: Yep personnally I am waiting for the next expansions x) not interested in fated season
[5:21:52] kathsukii: Deadge

[5:22:27] tomtomlolz: @Naguura  what u have to when u rich maa level and do all stuf :) ?
[5:22:35] xenrelay: bunch of cry-babies

[5:23:49] big_hero_d: a lot of things was address and game slowly change for better
[5:23:50] exaltyyo: Goodmorning from Wisconsin Naguura :)
[5:23:55] ophencie_bdo: yeah i dont see much people talk shiiet a bout DF so that a W
[5:24:08] TotallyNotRaien: let me be one, i hate df lol
[5:24:33] Hegzvold: fav season in DF? :O
[5:24:45] exaltyyo: you always have good vibes playing in the background
[5:24:46] Halonen: I thought so to but then i had to play aug in raid for a tier
[5:25:05] korean_baj: delete aug
[5:25:24] exaltyyo: lol
[5:25:27] ItsUrBuddyJake: What about AUG is problematic?
[5:25:36] StreamElements: For Highlights, fun content and guides, remember to subscribe to my youtube channel -> https://www.youtube.com/naguura
[5:25:37] DoubleProGG: i like dev evoker kinda thinkin about reroling to it for season 4
[5:25:38] ItsUrBuddyJake: Just curious
[5:25:42] Philaeux: toxic
[5:25:42] xjtc: Kick Monkclunge he will int your key
[5:25:46] xjtc: very toxic player
[5:25:48] woldosauros_tv: same lol delete the spec
[5:25:49] xenrelay: YESSS delete aug
[5:25:52] RakaEU: Game was better before it xD
[5:25:56] exaltyyo: hahah so much hate for aug
[5:26:13] xenrelay: nr1 issue with wow = aug
[5:26:15] DoubleProGG: i mean in war withing we wil have more supprot specs i think witht he hero talent stuff
[5:26:31] exaltyyo: most likely unfortunetly double
[5:26:33] korean_baj: feel bad for dev evokers the most with augs
[5:26:37] Halonen: The hate is not unfounded, i seriously dont know a single aug evoker that stills play the game after hitting CE. Everyone is just done with it
[5:26:46] ItsUrBuddyJake: Because it does not really fit in the 3 defined roles or something else?
[5:27:35] xenrelay: I hated them when they got announced.
[5:27:54] Jothor83: Aug evoker is something new to wow its normal to have polarized opinions on it
[5:27:57] kitty0chi: are you in general against support specs or just aug and what aug does?
[5:28:04] korean_baj: because those fotm aug rerollers realized how miserable they are

[5:28:15] kathsukii: Deadge again
[5:28:18] vikutoru11: Personally, I think Aug is fun to play but they brought so many balancing problems and it being mandatory in every group was just unfun
[5:28:19] big_hero_d: ppl who like Aug are mentaly ill and play aug bbc they can start doing 20+ instead of their regular 10 ish -.- that the truth about aug
[5:28:22] ItsUrBuddyJake: Its like bringing a Bard to DnD
[5:28:23] Jothor83: pressed incarnation?
[5:28:43] evrynameistkn: Its broken because there is no class that competes for its roll
[5:28:45] factory398: I refuse to bring a Aug to any of my groups.
[5:28:50] Philaeux: where are the aug evoker players now
[5:28:54] ophencie_bdo: season 2 i used to see so many now i barely see them
[5:28:58] wayslay: still think aug evoker is great an d they should bring more support specs to the game
[5:29:02] Jothor83: my only issue with Aug evoker is that its a cheat for lazy ppl to get to high keys or was when it was broken
[5:29:08] Halonen: We quit the expansion for now @Philaeux
[5:29:09] Jacksprat47: aug wouldn't be that much of a problem if keys were still dps limited rather than survival limited for most people
[5:29:12] insomain: I think people were happy that blizz was trying something new but now it's not as shiny and people see all the problems.
[5:29:22] korean_baj: aug evokers realized they dont like being the submissive player in the group
[5:29:26] Tophwow: @Jothor83 On really high keys aug was also not free tbf
[5:29:29] xenrelay: wow was not built with  support spec in mind, it is stupid to bring one in when it has so many specs and classes already!
[5:29:34] xenrelay: no place to put them.
[5:29:38] big_hero_d: well the reason aug is not as OP now its purly bbc there is more balance in game, and aug scales not with own skill and state but from how other class are OP with their bufs
[5:29:43] Raggu2: Its always neat to see ranged nameplates vs melee ones.
[5:29:57] ItsUrBuddyJake: Its like bringing a bard on a dnd campaign.... everyone hates that he becomes the carry
[5:30:21] Halonen: Survivability by just playing the specc like usual is mindboggling
[5:30:29] wayslay: yeah they need to fix the damage thing
[5:30:47] ophencie_bdo: PI should be personal LUL
[5:31:01] Tophwow: @Halonen Oh really? Stamina buff and versa buff is the same then?
[5:31:14] Jacksprat47: aug buffs just need to be flat damage based on attacks/spells, not actually buffing stats
[5:31:35] Jacksprat47: and the survivability should be a lot more active, not passive 80% uptime
[5:31:46] korean_baj: blizzard loves borrowed power so much they made it an entire spec
[5:31:56] rinma1: rly hate that the numbers are inflated, like assa and sub rogue, who get all buffs
[5:32:17] TynrionTV: So, contribute the BL class the dmg extra done then?
[5:32:55] Jacksprat47: no cause lust is aprty utility
[5:32:58] Jacksprat47: party*
[5:33:15] ItsUrBuddyJake: My guild doesnt give me PI or any special buffs and im the solo rogue... if I did get it my numbers would be inflated even without BiS trinkets or trinkets
[5:33:49] BizBichou: @rinma1 wait what buffs do rogues get
[5:33:52] just_ie: Any windfury totems in this discussion?
[5:33:59] Philaeux: What I hear is "this smart buff that add another layer of coordination is bad because i can't see the line in my dps meter"
[5:34:10] rinma1: @ItsUrBuddyJake yea had the same problem, after they saw how good it is to buff rogue in raid
[5:34:13] TynrionTV: windfury does not buff all the party members
[5:34:18] shiggady: !talents
[5:34:18] StreamElements: Most of the talents choices are playstyle/key level dependant, Feel free to play what you like!

[5:34:19] wayslay: it seems like people that play fringe classes are the ones most upset because if the third spot is always going to be a support now, then their class is not going to get the third spot?
[5:34:26] Aryndis: Hey Caro, i got cargo from Italy today. Guess what, your gift Beanie =)
[5:34:30] Aryndis: Thanks
[5:35:00] Kuroz: naguuraEgg
[5:35:04] rinma1: @BizBichou if u play assa u need pi and wf and aug, sub needs aug and wf
[5:35:10] Kuroz: naguuraHET
[5:35:29] kitty0chi: well windfury on revvez is just insane

[5:36:02] BizBichou: Hmm
[5:36:29] Shrugal: What if that's the reason they added the spec, to reduce the focus on hard dps numbers?
[5:36:56] just_ie: Aug evoker is especially annoying cause the log hooks are broken so we dont know the exact value they bring
[5:37:14] just_ie: Even though log hooks worked fine when they released aug evoker

[5:38:53] MrCrippels: thanks
[5:39:14] Jacksprat47: ngl they need to prune a lot of survivability
[5:39:26] kitty0chi: !song
[5:39:27] StreamElements: Current Song: Luude, Mattafix - Big City Life
[5:39:37] just_ie: Yeah augmentation is the incarnation of defensive power creep in dragonflight. feels really bad to plaay stuff like druid or shaman and being reliant on their defensive value
[5:39:38] Jacksprat47: mage, ret, aug are way too tanky right now
[5:39:46] fletch138: this my dead friends fav soing
[5:39:53] Raggu2: What would druids and rogues do without their 45 defensives?
[5:39:54] BizBichou: @Jacksprat47 and warlocks pepePHONE
[5:40:01] Jothor83: ehm as enha shaman i dunno .... surviving is not my strong suit ngl .... plz dont make me die more
[5:40:06] ItsYent: i disagree cuz it helps push skillful play. dont hit defensives die the issue is the scaling 1 shots
[5:40:08] Raggu2: or you do specifically mean things that reduce damage taken
[5:40:13] Jacksprat47: shaman has nothing to prune lol
[5:40:22] just_ie: @Jothor83 if they fix defensive power creep, they are never in a million years touching us
[5:40:25] Jacksprat47: @ItsYent the problem is the survivability imbalance
[5:40:28] kitty0chi: march adventure reward is a companion? :(
[5:40:35] Jothor83: i dunno bliz loves to mess with shamans
[5:40:43] kadashy1: @Jacksprat47 I think it's a lot more fun for everyone to have agency on whether they live or not
[5:41:00] ItsYent: @Jacksprat47 i have buddies who dont know how to hit defensives and die in 18s lol
[5:41:05] Sakosm: @Naguura Hi there how are you doing? Sorry to bother I had a m+ question about everbloom
[5:41:06] Jacksprat47: @kadashy1 except that make it hell for healers in lower keys
[5:41:47] ItsYent: obv give everyone the same options of DR. but taking defensives out across the board is a big no imo
[5:42:07] ItsYent: Healers say that but when they are asked to heal heal they get pissed at that too lol.
[5:42:09] Sakosm: @Naguura In 28+ everbloom keys can you get Gnarlroot in your route? I saw a key with squish and he did gnarlroot in his route
[5:42:16] Jacksprat47: nobody's saying to take defensives out completely
[5:42:40] Jacksprat47: just there shouldn't be such a disparity between say mage/ret and sham/shadow
[5:43:03] ItsYent: yeah balance out so everyone has around 2-3 Defensives
[5:43:04] JeventesTV: Give warrior cr and bl
[5:43:06] JeventesTV: Smile
[5:43:08] just_ie: @Jacksprat47 Shadow is a weird one to pair with shaman ngl.
[5:43:15] Sakosm: Damn 20 ads
[5:43:31] ItsYent: but the haler argument is a toss up because a lot of healers say they wanna actually heal then get pissed when they gotta actually heal lol
[5:43:33] Jothor83: w8 you all got defensives? - every shaman ever
[5:43:39] just_ie: real.
[5:43:49] JeventesTV: Defensives are a bigger issue this season than others since half the things one shot
[5:43:54] JeventesTV: Bad dungeon design
[5:44:12] Jacksprat47: @just_ie yeah mb I was distracted by food arriving. hunter/bomy/dev more appropriate there
[5:44:15] ItsYent: @JeventesTV true  but blizz also doesnt scale for the high keys for everything up to a 20 its fine
[5:44:22] AceReformed: Huge nuclear take, remove healer specc from and divide their abilities and their role among the other speccs YEP Make DPS and tanks entirely self reliant @Naguura
[5:44:31] JeventesTV: @ItsYent U dont need a single def for a 20
[5:44:57] ItsYent: @JeventesTV lol i've legit seen people die in 20s to boss abilities like EB's last boss slam
[5:45:10] kitty0chi: but isnt the whole point of diversity that some classes are good for something and some are bad for something?
[5:45:10] just_ie: @Jacksprat47 I would be lead to believe that the only specs in the game that are as down bad defensively as dps shaman is holy priest. But i mean not fun discussing who has the worst defensives in the game, when you play one of them
[5:45:11] Shrugal: And then they get defensive
[5:45:11] JeventesTV: We're they 440 ilvl Kappa
[5:45:21] ItsYent: @JeventesTV nah like 470
[5:45:27] TotallyNotRaien: here she goes ranting about bear form again
[5:45:36] StreamElements: For Highlights, fun content and guides, remember to subscribe to my youtube channel -> https://www.youtube.com/naguura
[5:45:40] Sakosm: Were you able to answer the question? :)  I'm back from ads
[5:45:52] just_ie: Atleast bear form is not Spirit wolf :)
[5:46:03] Raggu2: if we want to discuss one shots, thats one thing, I will never agree that any spec that is able to heal itself needs more defensives or is squishy.
[5:46:19] Fausstty: Adjusting damage received based on defensives is boring for me. Imo, adjusting defensives like Defensive Stance or Bear Form seems more accurate. Just having a button that will "save" you from X dmg but keep doing the same dmg is boring for me
[5:46:35] JeventesTV: Imo dungeon design is just bad currently, and VDH forces people into certain comps. If they remove the 40 sec cc of a vdh more classes will be viable again suddenly
[5:46:53] Ranoth_: It's funny, this makes me realize that warlock has everything defensively
[5:46:55] Jacksprat47: @Raggu2 ret was squishy as fuck before the rework. just adding baseline tankiness and a single small dr made them tanky af
[5:46:56] ItsYent: the dungeon design is fine its just not suitable for a high key environment
[5:47:16] jubbs: or youre a shaman that is bad in every situation
[5:47:21] bubz1108: yeah monk has like 3 short cds and cocoon
[5:47:25] bubz1108: kinda bonkers
[5:47:30] Malthael2735: @fausstty for me having to swap to bear form every 15 seconde is more boring
[5:47:38] ItsYent: Blizz doesn't tune M+ for high keys therefore the high key pushers feel balancing is bad when for the casual 20 its fine
[5:47:40] just_ie: Remove vers for real
[5:47:42] bubz1108: aka yulons grace
[5:47:56] Raggu2: @Jacksprat47 to me, doesnt matter, if were talking generic toughness against moderate incoming damage, any spec that is able to freely healitself is almsot by definition not squishy.
[5:48:02] Fausstty: @Malthael2735 yeah but they can adjust the dmg received so that you don't have to do that every other cdr

[5:48:27] shaybacktv: trueee
[5:48:28] ItsYent: sounds like you want the healer to be in full control of your life and you have no say in it. I've played classic and I am not a fan lol
[5:48:33] scilly1609: what about tokens for avoidance, same like gems from vaults, after some weeks i am done with gems and vault drops nothing
[5:48:34] xenrelay: they exist so aug can exist for the same reason :p.  why have them in the first place.
[5:48:34] Shrugal: They have to fill up the talent tree with something
[5:48:39] Gaz_Games_: wasn't that kind of tied into levelling back in the day? i.e. your character masters some combat so takes less damage?
[5:48:49] Raggu2: @Raggu2 As a warrior with almost no ability to healmyself period, I can assure you, you might think something is squishy unitl you paly something that relies entirely on outside healing.
[5:48:56] Malthael2735: @fausstty i Was bored enough to switch my balance to tank druid, imagine. So now im in bear form forever but it feels ok
[5:48:59] boyzbee: Bear form Dr lasts 10seconds after shifting back or you get an extra 10% HP while in form would be more fun than passive Dr talent
[5:49:00] xenrelay: :D
[5:49:05] wraghelm: people wanting current levels of damage and defensives clearly have never had to farm rageheart on their priest
[5:49:10] xenrelay: still same line of thinking
[5:49:34] xenrelay: there is a reason why I have quit healing.
[5:49:44] just_ie: WIth how JdotB has been tweeting, i also want healers to get more control - so he can get off twitter for 5 minutes
[5:49:51] Jothor83: hey i can tell you as a shaman , my life is on healers hands more than 90% of the time , else i heal my self and do no dmg , you win some you lose some
[5:50:00] ItsYent: @just_ie his tweets carry wow twitter

[5:50:18] TotallyNotRaien: agency
[5:50:21] just_ie: @ItsYent His rants during MDI doesnt
[5:50:23] Fausstty: Survivability should have a cost, but not high CD... Should take away something for the duration of the defensive
[5:50:26] Raggu2: @Jothor83 yes, you have that choice. You can choose that outcome. The outcome for someone without is chosen for them, they die.
[5:50:36] Sakosm: @Naguura Do you know if Gnarlroot is worth killing in everbloom in higher keys? :) I have him in my route
[5:50:40] ItsYent: @just_ie oh yeah but thats his vocals not his tweets
[5:50:56] RJ_Yuna: song?
[5:51:29] ItsYent: Fort week week Gnarlroot ? wtf lol
[5:51:32] just_ie: @Fausstty Oh like feint? which they also want to do damage in war within :)
[5:51:37] RJ_Yuna: !song
[5:51:41] thoughtsoutloud: you have the chilllest vibe ever
[5:51:47] Jothor83: @Raggu2 not exactly , in a mythic+ the dps slots are numbered if i dont hit means more dmg has to come from somewhere else or we lose time , also my mana pool as enha lets me heal me 3-4 times then i die
[5:51:52] StreamElements: Current Song: Could not connect to remote server
[5:52:04] hunnieplss: you making it easier
[5:52:04] Raggu2: Ive died to so many mechanics where simply being able to stop and heal myself for even a paltry amount would have meant I wouldnt have died.
[5:52:16] evrynameistkn: Healers dont want to heal, they really want to be dps
[5:52:39] xenrelay: not true
[5:52:40] xenrelay: xd
[5:52:43] Jothor83: resto druid in cat form going rawr heal your self Kappa
[5:52:44] just_ie: @evrynameistkn Nah, they just want a free ride through an m+ dungeon
[5:53:01] evrynameistkn: They start quitting the game if healing gets too hard
[5:53:39] Jacksprat47: also ice cold doesn't need to be a 70% dr Kappa
[5:53:41] kallisz: healing doesnt need to be harder to balance defensives
[5:53:52] BizBichou: @evrynameistkn they start quitting the game when dps don't press any defensives and flame the healer when they die ThumbsUpCat
[5:54:01] Jothor83: so you say take the insane amount of defensives in some classes and drop the overall dmg so healers dont get overwhelmed?
[5:54:22] BlizzardBrutal: is there a cross realm for mythic raids ?
[5:54:28] BizBichou: @BlizzardBrutal yes
[5:54:44] Cellastria: for example if they removed devotion aura (a 3% DR).. they would also reduce all incoming damage by 3% also
[5:54:54] BizBichou: FLASHBANG
[5:54:57] kitty0chi: how does that make sense? you wanna actually justify the "blame the healer" logic?
[5:55:03] kallisz: you just lower the treshold for 1 shots, right now its about going from 100% to 50% with drs up and then you top them
[5:55:13] neyrini: @evrynameistkn What. It's more that the issue that someone living is outside of your control as a healer in so many cases, if people don't press defensives you are uselesss because their survival isn't dependent on you but dependent on them pressing their stuff LUL
[5:55:36] StreamElements: For Highlights, fun content and guides, remember to subscribe to my youtube channel -> https://www.youtube.com/naguura
[5:55:46] xFlameX: so truth
[5:56:02] xFlameX: healing in pugs is so frustrating
[5:56:09] Jacksprat47: not to mention the additional layer of interrupts/stops that a priest healer is also down bad in.
[5:56:12] JeventesTV: that will bring issues tho
[5:56:17] Shrugal: Its even worse, because as a healer you have to react to a dps pressing or not pressing their cooldown
[5:56:18] JeventesTV: Warrior for example only brings being able to live
[5:56:26] Skyc0: WE GET TO PLAY GOD
[5:56:31] kitty0chi: yeah thats a bad idea
[5:56:53] Fausstty: Yeah but with 80% responsibility, if they die it's automatically the healer's fault
[5:57:00] Fausstty: At least that's what people will say
[5:57:07] kallisz: dps should use defensives reactivly not preactive with random gambling to win like p1 in last boss brh
[5:57:08] Jacksprat47: they say that now
[5:57:14] Fausstty: Yeah but imagine that
[5:57:16] Tophwow: Goes both ways though, if healer is bad then you feel bad as dps not being able to do about it
[5:57:17] Skyc0: It should be, if you have the ability to keep them alive.
[5:57:34] ItsUrBuddyJake: Everyone already blames the healers anyway
[5:57:44] Jacksprat47: it would be literally no different in blame but it would *actually* be in the healers hands and they have the control
[5:57:45] MainCharacter_: people's opinions here show their io and pugging so obvious
[5:57:46] Jothor83: <--- stupid healer , hello there
[5:57:47] ItsUrBuddyJake: Even if it's not the healer's fault
[5:57:48] kallisz: with 80% on healers you could save defensives and hp pots if its more rare that you would tick down
[5:57:48] kitty0chi: no its not - right now is the first time since bfa where as a healer i can say without any doubt - if you die its your fault
[5:57:53] Fausstty: Yeah but you take away defensives, people will just riot
[5:58:00] Fausstty: They still want some form of control over what they can do
[5:58:04] fatality_dota: How is that 4 dps works better on high keys , or better say faster ? I thought it was impossible until I watched some pro matches
[5:58:06] StreamElements: If you enjoy the stream make sure to check naguura out on her Socials : https://twitter.com/Naguura // https://www.youtube.com/naguura // https://www.instagram.com/naguura // tiktok.com/@naguura
[5:58:21] Fausstty: If they 80% rely on healers, then they'll just rage even more. BUT MUH ZUG ZUG
[5:58:26] Skyc0: With that power, come responsibility though
[5:58:26] kallisz: @kitty0chi exept if you are a class with few defensives. the balance is fkd
[5:58:35] Skyc0: So if you die, it's your own fault.
[5:58:39] ItsUrBuddyJake: You arent taking away all class defensives just reducing them
[5:58:52] Jothor83: see thats why i love my shaman , i dont have your probs with defensives , i just die ez HahaThink
[5:59:01] kallisz: @Jothor83 trueeee
[5:59:04] kitty0chi: @kallisz yeah, im totally agree that there is an imbalance in defensives between classes
[5:59:06] Skyc0: huge
[5:59:06] arkadios01: you are in a point where mdi teams do 4 dps on runs. I do look what you say, normally it should be impossible to be into a competitive team without a healer
[5:59:11] Fausstty: So unless they can increase the dmg uptime and therefore make a fight shorter, then I don't think it can work
[5:59:23] Kuroz: !healer
[5:59:23] StreamElements: Naguura is the first healer I have seen so far who actually understands her role and is good. She understands that a healer's task is to HEAL, which is why the role name is HEALER. She never deals any damage, because she is not a DAMAGE DEALER role. Hopefully the rest of the healers will catch onto that.
[5:59:39] Kuroz: hmmMeeting
[5:59:52] bubz1108: example
[5:59:53] bubz1108: afflicted
[5:59:56] kallisz: i swapped from enh that was my raid character because its infinetly harder to live above 26s. i need externals when all other classes can just payphone
[5:59:58] bubz1108: plus second boss trash in fall
[6:00:07] bubz1108: dispell bloom/chronoburst?>
[6:00:08] Jothor83: streamelements spitting facts
[6:00:10] bubz1108: or afflicted
[6:00:13] fatality_dota: in which kind of dungeons 4 dps works better than 3 dps 1 healer?
[6:00:29] Stinth: it makes the game harder to balance as well, when the healer is responsible for <=60% of keeping you alive
[6:00:32] Fausstty: So, shifting the responsibility to the healer should also mean the damage dealers should have the ability to do MORE damage and make fights shorter
[6:00:56] Jacksprat47: @Fausstty HUH
[6:00:56] kallisz: @fatality_dota never in incoordinated. atal 32 has been done with 4 dps
[6:01:02] arkadios01: @fatality_dota echo does atal with ret as a off heal
[6:01:12] kitty0chi: if you shift that responsibility onto healers, then nobody dispells afflicted
[6:01:18] BizBichou: @kallisz they do 4dps for ONE pull in 32 atal peepoBlushSip
[6:01:22] neyrini: @kitty0chi ??
[6:01:24] Jothor83: @Naguura the prob for me its that 40%-60% is not even truee for all classes some have very good defensives and some are legit healer save me
[6:01:41] wraghelm: I think nobody would stop expecting healers to do that
[6:01:49] TynrionTV: make the healer unable to deal with the affix maybe?
[6:01:51] kitty0chi: @neyrini at least thats how i see it in most pugs - if i dont then it doesnt get
[6:02:04] JeventesTV: hard discussion
[6:02:05] kallisz: if you dont dispell afflicte as dps youre just terrible at the game
[6:02:21] kitty0chi: im sorry im being negative - i just think that more options to blame healers is a bad idea
[6:02:23] fatality_dota: @kallisz Ranged DPS then I assume ?
[6:02:31] TynrionTV: Or give dps a buff when they do other mechanics right?
[6:02:34] Fausstty: I see Caro's POV now, but it's apparently not just shifting more responsibility to the healer
[6:02:34] everjaz: as someone who has been gearing little alts I am shocked at how many people just ignore so many things lol
[6:02:39] woldosauros_tv: boring affix
[6:02:40] Gaz_Games_: "healer job"
[6:02:44] kallisz: @fatality_dota ranged or melee doesnt matter
[6:02:44] Laziltv: I think its easy when others help with it
[6:02:50] Stinth: it feels like a disaster when I play a class that can't help with it
[6:02:50] BizBichou: make afflicted dealable by everyone angy i'm annoyed that i cant help with it
[6:02:51] arkadios01: thundering was fun
[6:02:56] lucian_five: ez. I can do both with guardian druid
[6:02:59] Jothor83: @everjaz you have no idea .... hell i am guildy of that too at times
[6:03:00] danzzannn: as a warrior player is no way to get invite so for me is a dog sht :D
[6:03:00] Jacksprat47: afflicted is a tad boring but at least it's not intrusive
[6:03:02] Fausstty: Affixes in general -> ResidentSleeper . Change M+ to actual Time trials
[6:03:03] Skyc0: It's ok, but the locations in which they spawn sometimes... kinda a headscratcher.
[6:03:06] fatality_dota: @kallisz I think it matters A LOT on the final atal boss
[6:03:08] Hedylamarr_: there are certain parts of dungeons that become impossible
[6:03:13] rahsky: is fine when u play with ppl who understand the them
[6:03:20] mika01: naguuraFlower  hi everyone
[6:03:20] Cellastria: since afflicted can be dispelled by a lot of classes its okay
[6:03:24] wraghelm: it’s good bc it’s easy.. and as a healer I can solo it if I have idiots. unlike incorp
[6:03:41] Kuroz: CatDriving @mika01
[6:03:44] Jacksprat47: isn't afflicted soloable by anyone with a dispel
[6:03:49] Jacksprat47: or are some cds longer
[6:03:54] Jacksprat47: idk all the cds
[6:04:07] Jothor83: i like afflicted every 2nd wave of them i put poison totem down the end :D i can feel useful
[6:04:14] BizBichou: @fatality_dota they don't do 4 dps on the last boss. they only do it for the first pull and then swap back to 3 dps.
[6:04:19] kallisz: @Jacksprat47 in theory, but the cd is about the same as the timer, so pray youre not in a cast and insta dispell
[6:04:36] Jacksprat47: @kallisz I mean you can see the spawn timer and where they're spawning
[6:04:42] Jacksprat47: if you're casting, that's on you :P
[6:04:55] wayslay: neither is 20 keys for the average player
[6:04:56] kilzogaming: its boring as fuck... its either a complete non issues or it alone will wipe groups i think its pretty bad design to have those kind of swings
[6:04:57] fatality_dota: @BizBichou Oh I see , that makes sense now
[6:05:02] BizBichou: exactly. it's only a thing in MDI where they just speedrun keys lower than they could actually do
[6:05:18] woldosauros_tv: half the classes cant engage with afflicted, that makes it boring, have to make comp for this week
[6:05:24] Jothor83: yeah MDI with the 3 dps aug and tank was crazy , i was like .... how is this legal LUL

[6:06:57] Kuroz: Naowh live keys clearly show that Kappa
[6:07:07] BizBichou: catJAM
[6:07:08] wraghelm: I think the main issue is that some affixes are super hard and still add time (sanguine) and some are super easy and don’t really add time (spiteful)
[6:07:47] Bleak07: catRAVE
[6:07:51] Jothor83: @wraghelm i hate spiteful those things have it for me .... i feel there is a pic of me in the spiteful shades barracks or something
