[0:38:32] StreamElements: Type !points to see how many points you have!
[0:38:33] morningstarjda: The problem is that gear is locked behind rating (atleast it was in 9.1 when I played last), and gear diff between max rank and 1400 is so big, that even if the boosters play bad, they can win solely on the gear diff
[0:38:35] Chrimz_: yeah they do, in that room too
[0:38:41] Taftazany: @Swifty Nice IRL video upload the other day, i missed it so much.  Thanks alot JOHN, coffe time on youtube one agian?
[0:38:45] keckterz: It's Warsong Weekend
[0:38:54] Chrimz_: It is WSG yeah, 100% I have been doing it
[0:39:04] aviduser2: your method where u see the amount of bgs open works well
[0:39:41] Taftazany: @Swifty Thanks alot, im 31 years old today, but those videos saved my days years ago

[0:40:02] StreamElements: Viewers and Subscribers generate points! You can redeem them at store for on screen effects! https://streamelements.com/swifty/store
[0:40:03] morningstarjda: Better gear for higher rating makes no sense as the power difference is already huge between a glad and a challenger level player. Adding 15% + more power ontop is just a complete overkill
[0:41:07] worhed76: lets do another Gym Vlog
[0:41:28] morningstarjda: SL is busted, only way I'd play it again is to play Demonology in pve
[0:41:48] w1dowmak3r: i personalllity think they killed retail
[0:42:14] TheEndIsNear777: last i heard there's only 2 pvp devs "balancing" shadowlands pvp

[3:54:57] Kaype92: @swifty you should try out ranged survival for arenas in retail and taking necrolord. Only works with 4pc tier set though
[3:55:56] still_salt: going for rank 14 on tbc? ;)
[3:57:21] Kaype92: No swifty you need those gcds for tier set procs because red bombs will make your kill commands reset
[3:57:23] aviduser2: lets gooo kara gdkp!
[3:57:26] timochiiGG: helm and gloves
[3:57:31] Kaype92: That‚Äôs why you go necro
[3:57:31] aviduser2: nop didnt buy
[3:58:16] aviduser2: ??
[3:59:04] Kaype92: Kill command resets give 40% chance to make your next free basically and do 80% more damage
[3:59:28] Kaype92: So when red bombs go out, you‚Äôre spamming kill command fishing for super damage bombs

[4:01:40] funkytownman21: Kyrian
[4:02:32] Kaype92: Ok so basically your 4pc makes your kill command resets have a 40% chance to give your next bomb 80% more damage and not incur cd. Because of that we‚Äôre not pressing raptor strike no where near as much since we want to throw as many bombs as possible

[4:04:33] FinalBossNZ: @phantomstranja games pumping atm bro. fun as
[4:04:49] Kaype92: That‚Äôs why ranged survival in theory makes sense since we don‚Äôt raptor strike as much and we‚Äôre throwing bombs from ranged and don‚Äôt need to be in melee as often. Might as well distance yourself

[4:06:05] Kaype92: Most of the time when you have tier bonus you‚Äôre just fishing for procs with kill command and throwing bombs
[4:06:43] Kaype92: Mad bombardier is the 2pc bonus effect
[4:07:12] funkytownman21: yes you  are correct, Guerrilla Tactics and Wildfire infusions

[4:09:40] Kaype92: Also swifty if you are going ranged, your level 45 talent row is completely useless since none of those talents work with a ranged weapon

[4:11:36] ttvKHAN36: wdym what? its going to get annouced on 19th
[4:11:51] Kaype92: I would be careful if you do try this because it‚Äôs a theorycraft build but has super good potential. Try to test this on a dummy and build around the tier set

[4:40:17] Kaype92: Oh one more thing swifty, if you really wanna go crazy with this build, this week is the only week to do legion mythic plus and you definitely want the trinket Moonlit Prism from vault of the wardens. It makes your bombs and ranged attacks stack agility and haste up to 20 stacks and since you are ranged, your arcane shots count as a stack. It's completely insane but that's an option if you want to min/max
