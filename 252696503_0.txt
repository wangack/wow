The region varies in size depending on which context, but it typically includes much of East Asia, South Asia, Southeast Asia, and Oceania. 👈

If ruson was on Ach's level he would be getting poach mail from top 10 US guilds, but he's not. Sad that Ruson is abusing his position in the second best Oceanic guild to fool the audience today.
