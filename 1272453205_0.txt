[1:09:21] kronguard: @honey_bunnzz I suggest not to, read some reviews like Linus Tech tips e.t.c, it's infamous for having middle mouse click die quite quick, it wears out way too quickly. I just got lucky i guess.
[1:09:34] clapatusmaximus: i didnt play video games for 3 days after hwl

[1:12:14] kronguard: @honey_bunnzz It's most likely a switch issue, same as with most mice, e/g g502, it's not that the clicking stops working, the switch wears out too quickly and stops properly registering input.
[1:12:21] foxxys856: its thanks to your past @Swifty wow had alot of players the infulance you gave people to play this game and be just like you is massive
