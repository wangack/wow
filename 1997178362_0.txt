[2:10:34] Radund01: @Draleric do you think the !streak command should also include the random character + random boss description for the future to stream questions about the runs.

[2:13:56] TheAcorner: BOOBA?
[2:14:05] Draleric: tyranosaurusxx he has to beat Beast for counter ingame to go up, we're not gonna do this silly thing where he exits then have streak be a different # than what is shown ingame lol
[2:14:05] Radund01: The randomizer said Dogma

[2:19:35] Radund01: cant wait this streak definitely has boss + character combos that have no way of winning

[2:21:12] Draleric: Uphill_Ninja nah Delirium and Ultra Greed arent part of it
[2:21:51] tyranosaurusxx: Makes sense to me. They kinda suck plus the only way to get delirium is you have to go hush so....
[2:22:01] Radund01: @Draleric Is greed on it then?
[2:22:12] tyranosaurusxx: I doubt that @radund01
[2:22:28] tyranosaurusxx: I'd assume hard mode only
[2:22:36] Radund01: It would be 2 game modes if that is the
[2:22:37] Radund01: case
[2:23:10] Luigge: well in delirium case, maybe it is an incentive for him to go faster and not break that much
[2:23:42] Luigge: to reach hush but hush might be hard depending on the character
[2:24:08] tyranosaurusxx: Yeah my favorite runs are the breaks
