[1:59:26] TheSothan: That's personal preference. I also played when the game came out, and then private servers for it subsequently. I personally like it.

[3:01:58] Stragic: @Gnocchi10 agreed
[3:02:12] Lazaros742: need to take invis pots off the pot cd
[3:02:36] fantom2k40: @Gnocchi10 or they could do engineering tool more reliable

[3:03:11] MomentOfEnlightenment: Druid > only viable healer
[3:03:20] TheAwesomePeter: Just mute those goblins for christ sake
[3:03:30] autoattackandy: yea they cant have any other professions, why they let them have drums
[3:03:59] mdicompslol: why not have drums?...
[3:04:08] Dratnos: @autoattackandy you can buy drums on the AH without having any leatherworkers in the group but you need to actually be an engineer to use the engy rez is the logic

[3:04:40] Lazaros742: anyone can hit a drum
[3:04:55] Lazaros742: but do you really want a nonexperienced person rezzing you with robotics?
[3:04:57] Dratnos: there isn't, but that's why drums is treated differently than other profession items

[3:05:56] Gnocchi10: i feel like though making big spells iconic to a class like lust into an item everyone can use it just makes the class pointless
[3:06:01] Dratnos: ya i don't agree with the rule but it's not like they chose at random
[3:06:03] GhostCalib3r: @Dratnos the greater logic is that battle rez is just as essential, if not more essential, than bloodlust, so it should be allowed to brez in mdi with engineer brez, as well as it being the same non-profession locked functionality similar to drums
[3:06:11] itsmelur: u should be a professional drummer to play the drums :)
[3:06:25] Gnocchi10: lol

[3:55:23] stylesz1: Let’s agree on this . Classic has no mechanics but has the better experience and more interaction with player community . Even tho it’s 15 years old . It’s still 15 years better than BFA & more fun . Retail raiding is harder than Classic because of the mechanic but in the Azeroth you can 1 hit mobs . It’s boring & no challenge . I have to die on purpose to make myself feel like I’m playing an MMORP and not pay to win

[5:10:22] itsmelur: @kujaaron yes, but classic doesn't require as much dev time as retail. so if they can make fat cash on classic over retail. classic wins from a business standpoint
[5:10:33] NashMarco: classic hype is over rag is dead get over it FailFish
[5:10:34] Dratnos: @trellsky the reason is that due to daylight savings time the east realm gets an extra 4% count

[5:12:42] Lazymedk: gamersreveng3 gz
[5:12:44] kujaaron: no, tons of people have already been banned on classic for using add ons that blizzard has stated will get you banned
[5:12:46] Eliyalol: @Dratnos VoHiYo
[5:12:59] mdicompslol: @diathial thing is...I'm NOT wrong though.
[5:13:04] Dratnos: @wippyxoxo the reasoning is that mechagon drops at 415 on live and so if it were on the TR and scaled up to 445 that'd be weird
[5:13:06] coowen: are they working on a exp after bfa? or is it classic all the way now
