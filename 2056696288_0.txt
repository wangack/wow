[3:24:07] Johniiboi: 7g 50s would be fair
[3:24:07] grobalxd: 75g inflation lmao
[3:24:10] Tropicocity: Also if any healer genuinely picked the 20 healing over 11 dmg And healing, they cucked themselves lol
[3:24:11] BlastMyNips: how much does it vendor for?
[3:24:11] donaldodie: stupid

[3:25:15] DevinMurksYou: I’m saving my quest turn in
[3:25:15] Tropicocity: Always take the damage trinket, there are too many opportunities to dps (as well as soloing) that make the straight healing one not worth
[3:25:18] Kewl__: @JokerdTV how much is 40 mount?

[5:03:10] Lostino: Against mobs with defense roughly equal to or higher than your Attack Rating (i.e. your weapon skill), you will have a chance to land a glancing blow instead of a normal hit. A glancing blow only occurs on white melee damage, cannot crit, and does less damage than a normal blow. If the attacker's weapon skill is less than his level * 5, the damage reduction will be proportional to the difference between the attacker's weapon skill and the target's defense.
