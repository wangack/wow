[1:24:46] rosina_scarlett: eu wins*
[1:24:46] JogiLove: yea thats the point why im happy to see na get it despite beeing eu
[1:24:48] Zerohz1: but those millions wont kill last boss for atleast a month anyway
[1:24:52] griffdog125: they blame it on the 21ST man. lol.
[1:24:53] mo197: Either way it was entertaining to watch all the teams
[1:25:03] MOLAR305: macauly "towelliee" was abit disturbing on Twitter this morning lol
[1:25:14] casualboomer: @Towelliee why don't they make the Race part of Blizzcon? Then it's a LAN environment and there's no difference between regions
[1:25:27] iTzSouth: if EU downs it today doesnt it come down to when the servers came up on eu/us?

[1:26:27] SpoonManes: makes sense
[1:26:44] Malindan: Nice camera decoration!
[1:26:48] neimahh: ECHO is old Method with 95% roster
[1:26:54] letsdothisbabyyy: Yeah it was a race forsure
[1:27:03] MOLAR305: they are at 2.1%
[1:27:19] Aervyper: Echo skipped Heroic splits yerstday and that made the differeance the tuning was that tight
[1:27:31] Matthecat05: no Sco no WF
[1:27:32] Cypfer: Some pulls were at the same percentage a few pulls that was intense
[1:27:55] blade_killa: I just noticed you shaved your head haha
[1:27:57] letsdothisbabyyy: Yeah I was hooked, I haven’t seen viewership like that in awhile since asmon with classic
[1:28:01] aksel______: they skipped splits on reset

[1:28:13] PrimalRain: they did most of them
[1:28:15] CrimsonNurse: I dont think them skipping splits was the reason, I think them taking so long to reclear was the reason. LiMiT destroyed the reclear that was the difference.
[1:28:17] NOS_4EVR: they skipped them yesterday after doing the re-clear
[1:28:21] letsdothisbabyyy: It was up to like 130k viewers, then with echo at 60k over 200k viewers watching!!
[1:28:31] Syrion93: It's not like Echo had a choice after the reset. They were a day behind Limit, it was either kill Denathrius or lose.
[1:28:42] skylaars: morning t dog. you gonna stream xmas day?
[1:28:44] mo197: their reeler 1 shots were cool af
[1:28:45] datswassup: 35 anima!!!
[1:28:59] mo197: reclear*
[1:29:07] Vanthere: I think its a bad look to take down your streams to preserve your "Strat" that has you ahead and then lose the race. Just makes them look like assholes
[1:29:19] GeeThePally: Just been watching Gingi stream and the toxicity is off the chart all this NA vs EU shit it was a good race, hope the do a worldwide release after this pandemic is over so both can go head to head properly, grats to Limit though their raid leader done amazing IMHO stayed calm all the way through, then you switched to Echos stream and they were just partying and shouting all the time
[1:29:20] letsdothisbabyyy: Actually I think it went up to 150k viewers at one point
[1:29:22] feherlofia123: @vanthere not really
[1:29:24] letsdothisbabyyy: That’s crazy
[1:29:25] Aquadriel: why not instead of waiting for blizzard to do global release, these guilds organize themselves and set days to start the race? I mean if they both want it fair? @Towelliee

[1:30:18] JogiLove: try to explain this to someone outside of wow playerbase. yea they cant kill him on lower difficulty.. thats why they don't waste time here and kill it on the hardest difficulty
[1:30:33] mo197: those streams were toxic the whole time towCringe
[1:30:34] JeemTeam: he is tired of everyones bs
[1:30:37] NOS_4EVR: Nnoogie
[1:30:40] rosina_scarlett: nnoggie yeah
[1:30:40] NOS_4EVR: whatever. lol
[1:30:42] datswassup: @GeeThePally paragraphs DansGame
[1:30:46] JeemTeam: he was right in what he said
[1:30:47] knight2387: knight2387 subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 9 months! 
[1:30:51] OkayButch: OkayButch subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 63 months! 
[1:30:54] aksel______: what did he say is there a clip?
[1:31:13] Nightz101: do you think the reign of echo is over?
[1:31:19] Serendepityz: i just realized nnogga changedd his name to nnoggie
[1:31:20] JeemTeam: yep finally
[1:31:24] Staksor: oh boy, the salt LULW
[1:31:28] JeemTeam: i'm happy he did it
[1:31:28] Luthercorpz: EU mad tru
[1:31:29] PVPworld: he made
[1:31:29] nathrizen: why is he so mad w/ the WA?
[1:31:30] kirshoxd: he was getting trolled a bit too hard
[1:31:30] letsdothisbabyyy: I was seeing last night someone was counting the all the viewers of all the guilds on twitch and it was over 300k viewers at one point. That’s great for wow.
[1:31:39] TheGaoSora: wait who?..
[1:31:51] JeemTeam: ppl so toxic in his chat thinking they entitled to what he works on
[1:32:03] amricatt: Who was?
[1:32:07] Aervyper: I honestly never realized how important Weak Aura's are \
[1:32:12] GeeThePally: @datswassup lol sorry man
[1:32:29] JeemTeam: sometimes????
[1:32:30] SpoonManes: we all humans dawg
[1:32:30] JeemTeam: lol
[1:32:34] treyfiveseven_23: Towellie here’s a serious question if you weren’t getting paid to play wow would you still play
[1:32:39] Syrion93: Sometimes? Twitch viewers are bastards lol
[1:32:40] treyfiveseven_23: LUL
[1:32:42] casualboomer: KICK HIM
[1:32:50] CrimsonNurse: Worldwide release is not going to happen, I am pretty sure. Echo should just level characters on a NA server. They normally travel to all be together any way what would be the issue with playing at some broadcasting center here in the US for the race. The ping is not bad in EU while playing in NA. It would be fine for leveling and gearing before the raid release.
[1:32:52] LoTuriX: life
[1:32:54] GeeThePally: @feherlofia123 yeah he is cool, some of his viewers though toxic is mental
[1:32:55] TxTexii5: TRUE
[1:33:06] roninnkush420: trolling
[1:33:06] TheGaoSora: Wait who're we talking about and what happened?
[1:33:07] casualboomer: If you don't want to get kicked, maybe don't be down there? Kappa
[1:33:08] Nightz101: kick him into de other side
[1:33:09] Relic7: Gingi is a great guy
[1:33:20] AlinksPast: and people wonder why i have no trust, thats why!
[1:33:23] Alienfromger: D: twitch chat are innocent butterlies
[1:33:24] Clay2K_: There's my sexy bald dad towW towLewd
[1:33:32] Kromede: RIFT
[1:33:38] TheGaoSora: ashes of overhype KEKW
[1:33:41] SpoonManes: butterfly witta dick
[1:33:43] Cypfer: that would be smart tbh
[1:33:43] FistoTheFistybot: PogChamp
[1:33:44] nathrizen: Towelliee's FF14 paladin still waiting
[1:33:53] risethefallen: He completely denied it before going to bed
[1:33:54] PrimalRain: that's the next step if no worldwide release
[1:33:54] Staksor: but then there still will be an excuse - higher ping LULW
[1:33:57] odriscoll1234: Man we had the pleasure of watching the best players in the world going head to head , stop this toxic bullshit NA vs EU
[1:33:58] treyfiveseven_23: Lol nice
[1:34:02] Relic7: Fragnance was saying that the MS / ping wouldn't be a big issue - their biggest concern is lag spikes
[1:34:05] feherlofia123: @sorasin42 ashes will take off
[1:34:11] PrimalRain: Limit has Eu players that deal with that ping though
[1:34:11] TheCliffyShow: All of Echo need to move to NA in real life.
[1:34:12] notdiggz: Who the fuck would want to live in america right now. as an anerican
[1:34:12] Staksor: just move to NA then Keepo
[1:34:17] Cypfer: Move to NA and represent EU, it's so EZ Kappa
[1:34:25] Hexof: to be fair ashes is super overhyped, i dont think gamers will learn to temper expectations. look at cyberpunk LUL
[1:34:31] mojusk: limit got a tank from EU, playing from EU
[1:34:48] Sincline387: they would also lose some intrinsic community support, like when people sell BOEs under market price to their "regional leaders" to try and help them win
[1:34:48] Moobot: Towelliee is now exclusively streaming on Twitch. It has been a long road! Now we begin a new era for Towelliee Gaming. Thank you all for supporting me for the last 10 years.

[1:34:49] TheGaoSora: @feherlofia123 I'm sure it will, just how tow said it made me laugh
[1:34:51] odriscoll1234: Just launch the mythic raids at the same time , cannot be that hard
[1:34:58] SkylineMWZ: !mod
[1:35:05] redbulladin: if its ex method its 1-0
[1:35:06] Relic7: @mojusk Yeah Scott, they also had Naowah who is currently a Echo tank, was their tank last tier
[1:35:08] SkylineMWZ: !addon
[1:35:09] kirshoxd: limit getting 3 fatsharkyes players was pretty big this tier
[1:35:14] redbulladin: method lost nyalotha
[1:35:32] feherlofia123: im predicting ashes to be among te top 5 mmo games over the next 10 years
[1:35:36] feherlofia123: u heard me
[1:35:39] TheGaoSora: @redbulladin They took a post pull brake and never came back Kappa
[1:35:42] mcdoublemcgee: The shaved head looks unreal
[1:35:45] Aquadriel: why dont guilds coordinate and set rules to start at the same time? If they want it fair dont wait for blizzard to solve your problem @Towelliee
[1:35:46] Syrion93: Method as a guild has 12 world first titles, how are thy 0/2 again?
[1:35:46] Auru: Wish they would get rid of Scripe. Makes that guild so hard to like and cheer for
[1:35:49] letsdothisbabyyy: What’s the story on the shaved head
[1:35:53] jamiboiy: @feherlofia123 but what does it really take to be a top 5 mmo game?
[1:36:04] yummychickenzz: @Towelliee hey what covenant is good for guardian Druid?
[1:36:06] Contractual_: sure Kapp
[1:36:07] Relic7: @feherlofia123 Top tier raiding
[1:36:10] mo197: Method absorbed a guild too
[1:36:11] amricatt: @letmeseeyourtdes He shaved it due to Limit's win
[1:36:12] Matthecat05: no SCO no WF
[1:36:13] SkylineMWZ: na meen Kappa
[1:36:17] kirshoxd: fatshark has the lowest wipe count as well i believe and they dont day raid
[1:36:24] PrimalRain: I believe fatshark will get picked up. they are better than other guilds that day raid
[1:36:32] mojusk: i thought pieces wouldve been closer to limit/echo than they are
[1:36:39] Syrion93: Honestly, the day advantage is not really an advantage until the reset happens.
[1:36:39] TheGaoSora: Wait so who's the WA guy you were talking about? O.o
[1:36:42] mo197: Ja-baited
[1:36:43] casualboomer: @Towelliee I wouldn't be surprised if phasing from WM affects node
[1:36:44] feherlofia123: if final fantasy 14 dies and ashes of creation takes its place my life is complete
[1:36:51] treyfiveseven_23: I haven’t played wow since wrath
[1:36:58] squigglytv: @Towelliee i was listening to you raid at 4am (UK) yesterday....i stole your tactic for Sunstrider fight...it worked amazing. Thanks
[1:37:08] SpoonManes: cool
[1:37:33] Buckwink: EU didnt have to worry about bugs or learning fights
[1:37:41] treyfiveseven_23: This expression looks nice
[1:37:41] odriscoll1234: 👌
[1:37:48] TheGaoSora: @feherlofia123 FF won't die, it has a big niche audiance, just like classic
[1:37:50] chulklol: i agree
[1:37:58] CrimsonNurse: Max said that FSY just watch kill videos and are really good at implementing the strat. Max said playing out in front and developing strats is very much a different game
[1:38:00] Aquadriel: why dont guilds coordinate and set rules to start at the same time? If they want it fair dont wait for blizzard to solve your problem @Towelliee
[1:38:04] Relic7: @Poondog Get your point, but Echo and Limit actually had different tactics for last boss when it came to the four horseman, so that's a sweeping generalisation
[1:38:07] Aervyper: @Towelliee well look at when echo went dark on last boss.... When limit came back the strats we're different
[1:38:15] feherlofia123: @sorasin42 weebs and cat girls
[1:38:17] SpoonManes: them catbois
[1:38:22] jamiboiy: a fight bugged or not, it is still hours of practice doing the fight, it all translates over once fixed
[1:38:26] TheGaoSora: @feherlofia123 preety much LUL
[1:38:32] redbulladin: yeah or limit having their 50 more pull attempt than EU and learn the fight faster even tho it bugged would be nice to see both team have same amount of pulls
[1:38:34] DaneAlmighty: Last time it was REALLY bad was mythic Kil'Jaeden
[1:38:35] thePhobus: @Aquadriel because there's the problem of some guild don't follow that and claim WF
[1:38:40] Aervyper: honestly 9/10 was unkillable still now if it didn't get nerfed a bit
[1:38:47] w1ldsensei: !armory

[1:39:56] TheGaoSora: good luck on huntsman
[1:39:57] Hexof: ye i got renown from LFR
[1:39:59] Aquadriel: thePhobus i mean lets be honest there's only 2-3 guilds who do this race, you can set a rule between these 3 and respect them. If someone doesnt well that's a community issue, not blizzard.
[1:40:00] rumphrend: LFR actually isnt that bad first wing it seems
[1:40:04] treyfiveseven_23: Ok boomer
[1:40:16] matrixr666: yeah i am addictive now lol

[1:41:27] Kaykerrs: Friends don't let friends do LFR
[1:41:29] thePhobus: @Aquadriel we are in 2020 almost 2021, Blizzard can and should release everything at the same time all over the world, the solution of "let's be nice and coordinate between guilds when to start" simple doesn't work
[1:41:47] treyfiveseven_23: It’s aways a trap
[1:41:58] Sincline387: Do you want MDI 2.0...because asking for blizzard to be involved with WFR is how you get MDI 2.0
[1:42:04] mo197: yeah let the community roll with it

[1:47:32] notdiggz: Being in a pandemic helps a bit lol
[1:47:37] Rottencoarse: probably getting less comission XD
[1:47:40] prairydog: its a sellers market
[1:47:41] defender95: 3% FROM 150k is decent
[1:47:43] thebakeriscomingforu: Ah, getting it for what it is worth. Not what inflated market says. got it
[1:47:56] defender95: 4500 bucks
[1:47:58] Djulio: why does the ownerneed an agent to sell a house if she has (found) people to sell it to?
[1:47:58] Vanthere: Are you still going to be in Cali?
[1:48:02] thebakeriscomingforu: Congrats Towelliee
[1:48:03] JohnsOrb: yeah, usually a 6%, but depending on where you are
[1:48:06] treyfiveseven_23: You should’ve told her you’re turning this into a trap house 🏡
[1:48:11] defender95: 6% holy fuck
[1:48:15] amricatt: @Vanthere He's buying the house he's currently in.

[1:50:15] yoloswagnation: they're gonna praise you for such a sick deal!
[1:50:21] Chronatog13: <realtor here, it's 6% for buyer and seller agents usually, but minus splits and broker fees agents only usually get 1.5% it splits to 3% for buying agent 3% for selling agent, then each agents broker gets half of their cut so you only end up with 1.5%
[1:50:22] Frostjinx: the appraiser will most likely measure the house / take photos of everything (inside included).. Then has to find other sales in the area to compare your house to
[1:50:53] griffdog125: turn around and sell it in 3 months for 170k more lol

[3:28:51] hunterxp: LUL
[3:29:00] TheUnknowing: rip paladin Kappa
[3:29:44] Scobann: my 207 pally takes more damage than my 195 DH
[3:29:50] 345kiwi: thoughts on DH?
[3:29:52] skargoyle: What is the issue with Pally?
[3:29:55] TheUnknowing: No I get it, my paladin has kind of been getting rekt so
[3:29:56] wushii420: wait what happen to pallys? whats wrong with them?
[3:29:56] SmokedHog: what's wrong w/ paladins?
[3:29:57] scarface9113: Yeah, paladins are not that great in PVE
[3:29:58] Kuroii_Ck: paladins are took spiky to be good right now
[3:29:59] SmokedHog: is it in higher keys?
[3:30:04] Yordie_Sanders: Paper paly D:
[3:30:07] zaraine1: you took a fury warr? Bless you
[3:30:08] hunterxp: They are good in PVP

[3:30:34] Megadisaster24: I don't think were getting the appropriate armor increase from SotR
[3:30:48] WILLIWJ: I thought I was bad so their is a with Prot Paladin
[3:30:59] Megadisaster24: like the beginning adds in De Other Side just wreck the fuck out of me
[3:31:03] Sollice: Paladin seems like its in a weird place all over. Max said Limit brought two Holy Paladins because of their DPS output as healers. They did negative healing he said
[3:31:05] Xombi: prot pallys taking an unusual amount of physical damage?
[3:31:07] Veras_7: what happened to your hair?
[3:31:15] SamDavidsin: ah blizz teaching employees to "care" more
[3:31:18] yeaahyeah: Ever tank i play with in groups seem a little more stable than pallies
[3:31:22] SmokedHog: prot pally can also heal every 5 seconds to full
[3:31:27] Kuroii_Ck: I really thought that was the tradeoff do high tank dps but take a little more damage than normal tanks
[3:31:44] SmokedHog: prot pallys do most damage and most heals
[3:32:02] D3m0nHunt3r666: literally been getting groups that skip this mechanic
[3:32:03] SmokedHog: they are a glass cannon
[3:32:06] yeaahyeah: The whole you either heal or mitigat system is kinda dumb imo
[3:32:06] D3m0nHunt3r666: and never grab adds lol
[3:32:08] cschwartzy: What? Prot Paladins are more than fine in PVE. I've healed all the tanks in mythic and they all are fine
[3:32:08] TheUnknowing: I mean there shouldnt really be a trade off tbh, like yeah we have good damage and healing but we cant heal a one shot know what i mean?
[3:32:09] hunterxp: i think h pal just needs the good old infusion of light back also

[3:32:41] SmokedHog: that's true. I get one shot all the time in spire of ascension LUL
[3:32:50] TheUnknowing: there has been times progressing so far where im nearly like full health and then im just destroyed even with cool downs as a prot pally so, i get the wanting to switch possibly
[3:33:05] BenOSC: Think it's like 14% downstairs
[3:33:12] FrozenShades: This last boss and Margrave are really good voice actors
[3:33:12] MrAxeffect: 10% downstairs yes
[3:33:28] SmokedHog: I would rather have more damage mitigation rather than having to use word of glory

[3:34:14] juxive: "buff ret" KEKW
[3:34:20] Xombi: what addon gives you the circle around your cursor ?
[3:34:22] wushii420: my DH does not feel squishy at all lol
[3:34:28] itsCloaker: is Mystic Touch all DPS buff? or only attack damage
[3:34:33] hunterxp: Just keep buffing Rets, this is the wayyy
[3:34:38] maccaruso: Warriors still sucking ass too
[3:34:41] killswiitch: What about prot warriors????
[3:34:48] killswiitch: lol they suck
[3:34:49] yeaahyeah: Its annoying playing with a prot pally because they have to be spikey to be good

[3:34:55] kodtheog: how did you get ur evlui so clean in the bottom corner mine looks like crap lmao
[3:34:56] SmokedHog: vengeance DH can run keys 10 item levels lower and still time the key
[3:35:01] cschwartzy: I'll tell you. Out of all the tanks I love healing Bears.
[3:35:05] FrozenShades: @Maccaruso Prot warriors are actually slept on right now, there actually not bad.
[3:35:08] Viscule: Bear tanks don't seem to take much dmg so far, but haven't done really high keys with em.
[3:35:13] Aervyper: the Holy Pally comment was interesting
[3:35:14] D3m0nHunt3r666: utility warriors who would have thought... towCringe
[3:35:17] Viscule: But they also don't do much dmg, so it's a tradeoff? I guess
[3:35:24] noteworthynerd: Max straight up said Prot was bad, but they needed the Rallying and Arms is worse
[3:35:24] SmokedHog: bear tanks have their own rejuv non stop
[3:35:30] littlesack: I hate this boss's voice so much

[3:35:53] SmokedHog: @fourseti1234 LIMIT won
[3:36:04] TexValhalla: Actually prot warriors are smackin, they aren’t as squishy as prot pally rn either imo
[3:36:07] Goddessofkush: you liking BRM?
[3:36:11] fourseti1234: @jayjeee_ ah i ci cya i sw them get to 1.8% makes sense
[3:36:20] littlesack: limit won, but echo took less overall time
[3:36:20] SmokedHog: prot war dps sucks balls tho
[3:36:29] FrozenShades: @GrittyTexan Exactly, they take no damage whenever I heal
[3:36:38] Elkahira: whats the mouse addon @Towelliee
[3:36:40] SHIMOxxKUMA: @littlesack That's actually not true, echo took 30 minutes more roughly
[3:36:40] The_Tyrannical_Talkboxx: Echo also uses most of limits strats :P
[3:36:48] D3m0nHunt3r666: he's fine, calculated
[3:36:51] noteworthynerd: "Echo took less time overall" rofl
[3:36:55] hunterxp: Poor prot warriors LUL, everyone says "They suck ass"
[3:36:56] lolh_sunseeker: Merry Christmas @Towelliee ... Welcome to the Baldman Club. LUL And gratz to Limit out there.
[3:36:56] D3m0nHunt3r666: LUL
[3:36:58] The_Tyrannical_Talkboxx: I think the only major difference was there sire pulls
[3:36:59] Incredible_Sausage: they made the slime wider too
[3:37:03] D3m0nHunt3r666: squished
[3:37:06] Gorestack: not even tyrannical KEKW
[3:37:07] littlesack: well they said they took less time when they finished, I wasn't timing it
[3:37:07] cschwartzy: I'll tell you. These mythics as a healer are not fun. So much stupid damage.
[3:37:13] zaraine1: Have more problems with the spider usually
[3:37:13] Yordie_Sanders: Echo did it in "4" less pulls is all KEKW
[3:37:15] Epiclawlzable: I hate this boss lmao
[3:37:17] eximisprime: best fight in the game
[3:37:20] SmokedHog: lets not have the salty echo vs. limit fanboy convo
[3:37:24] noteworthynerd: Agreed @cschwartzy A lot of it is avoidable though if the other players do mechanics :/
[3:37:29] littlesack: I don't care either way lol
[3:37:31] Undying_faith: Damn hair fell out overnight?
[3:37:31] Staksor: Idk, I find this boss fun
[3:37:32] 8bitbarbarian: this boss is a bit of a nightmare for healers if there's no disease cure
[3:37:42] H0L3S: No one carrrrres. Limit won. Echo did a great job. We'll go again next tier.
[3:37:43] TexValhalla: Y’all do realize that Limit used a prot warrior and he was smackin shit around right?
[3:37:47] ZeL77: Mythics arent supposed to be easy, dps should recognize the need to kite lol. Healers should be prepared for idiots not to kite lol, its fun :)
[3:37:55] Kaykerrs: at least they aren't dying to the slappers like yours truly @Towelliee Lmaoooooooooo
[3:38:00] Cyntec: @Towelliee all yer hair moved fromyer head too your face?
[3:38:00] majorizc: this boss is hard for healers
[3:38:03] Staksor: NotLikeThis
[3:38:04] cschwartzy: @noteworthynerd yes and no. There is a ton they can avoid so they don't get 1 shot but overall there is so much splash/aoe damage. It really makes it not fun for healers.
[3:38:09] D3m0nHunt3r666: LUL
[3:38:11] Yordie_Sanders: Darkee is also the best gamer ever
[3:38:12] calendorf: i hate healing this boss, so annoying
[3:38:15] noteworthynerd: @GrittyTexan Max literally said they brought a prot warrior for the Rallying and that's it. If not for the Rallying they would have brought a different tank

[3:39:00] cschwartzy: But yeah @noteworthynerd having a group that knows mechanics obviously makes it easier :D
[3:39:02] Todmeister9000: towDynt
[3:39:06] TexValhalla: I still think prot warrior is in a better state than prot pally
[3:39:06] Aquatic_Sloth: damn they still haven't increased the anima rewards per dungeon scaling?
[3:39:09] swordwindgaming: LFR Narthia is free cake don't sweat it
[3:39:11] Cyntec: @Towelliee dam bro, dont be so needy
[3:39:11] Mattucho: ilvl > stats
[3:39:12] Elkahira: @Towelliee whats the mouse addon?
[3:39:13] cschwartzy: @noteworthynerd 100%
[3:39:14] TexValhalla: But that’s just me

[3:39:22] AnunnakiOnYT: Actually take that cloak, haste/vers is good for offensive tanking!
[3:39:23] zaraine1: either remove that 35 or add more its just insulting...
[3:39:39] D3m0nHunt3r666: 208 towClap
[3:39:39] Kuroii_Ck: blaming healers? you've changed toweliee WeirdChamp
[3:39:40] Cyntec: @Towelliee Boss you thirsty, it will come in time, be kool
[3:39:40] squigglytv: 207...damn your alt is higher than my main lo
[3:39:41] mrelgaato: Does LFR drop weapons?
[3:39:44] MOXP: would limit have won the race if there would have been a global release/reset of raids?
[3:39:50] KNash92: yea, 35 anima is a slap in the face. At least give me 250 if I'm not getting gear.
[3:40:00] GoGetItKo: Halls of Atonement
[3:40:05] Sarynrae: @schilder limit won regardless. echo was an hour late
[3:40:11] Powerofwar_1: what legendary do you run on your prot pally?
[3:40:16] cschwartzy: @KNash92 100% agree, it's pretty ridiculous
[3:40:20] Quimby54: @KNash92 would be nice if the amount of anima scaled with key level, like azerite did
[3:40:23] ticonis: Deathguard20 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 37 months! Happy Holidays Towelliee
[3:40:25] MOXP: @Sarynrae that was not my question though :D

[3:41:01] Xombi: 35 anima is a joke
[3:41:01] cahoots82: 250 anima per M+ is ridiculous. People would max out so fast. 35 is too low, but 250 is too high.
[3:41:03] VIRUSplw: @Blackmarsh method dungeon tool

[3:41:11] xeeeoN: @schilder yeah but you really play your 100% when you already lost the race and go to sleep? i ddon't think so. but it doesn't matter
[3:41:12] HumanityDH: just press W
[3:41:25] MOXP: @Sarynrae again, not asking that :D
[3:41:28] swordwindgaming: I think they don't want to give out anima through dungeon running because people would just run dungeons all day instead of participating in the WQs.
[3:41:30] SlackerSlack017: u need 88
[3:41:35] Cyntec: around 12% in the basment sir
[3:41:38] WILLIWJ: I do a couple runs as Dps and see what other tanks do and use that route
[3:41:40] Elkahira: you dont need that much tenctacles as well
[3:41:41] SpoofAvatar: 100 would be ok
[3:41:49] Xombi: not even gold
[3:41:52] Sarynrae: @schilder the answer is yes either way.
[3:41:56] Aervyper: 35 anima and it takes 150 to heal a dude
[3:41:57] 8bitbarbarian: it should at least be 35 per boss
[3:42:03] Steveennnnn: what is the plater profille you are using ?

[3:42:32] zaraine1: how do you get soul ash missions?
[3:42:37] Xailen: mission table wins are a myth
[3:42:37] Aquatic_Sloth: do you have the weak aura for missions?
[3:42:40] kodtheog: theres a good wa that allows you to know when u win command table or not @Towelliee i have it if u want it
[3:42:41] AureliusXV: night fae i win them all
[3:42:44] AureliusXV: lol
[3:42:47] Quimby54: love the mission table as nightfae, can put 1 champion and 4 troops in and its a guaranteed win
[3:42:47] ThePawPaw: thx 2020Victory, @mindkrush

[3:42:51] Malarick: mission tables suck
[3:42:57] KingFTW: Is there an addon for the mission table?
[3:42:57] Steveennnnn: @Steveennnnn scheers !
[3:42:58] Windnecro: yeah mission table as a night fae is a joke. its impossible as venthyr
[3:42:59] HumanityDH: reduced loot LUL
[3:43:02] Asuo_: It's "quality of life" improvements
[3:43:06] HumanityDH: target cap LUL
[3:43:10] Aervyper: @Towelliee mission table is a try to Mimic raid: Shadow... yea go back to old table your copy sucks
[3:43:11] Sarynrae: @schilder if it was a global release echo still wouldve been 17 hours behind on the kill... not hard to understand
[3:43:14] BGrunt73: Bro, shaving your head for Limit is sooooo epic
[3:43:15] 8bitbarbarian: i miss the Legion mission table...made so much gold from that thing LUL
[3:43:21] Capt_Cooki3: helloo helloo @Towelliee how areya?how are we bois?
[3:43:28] AureliusXV: slow the game down
[3:43:35] AureliusXV: only reason
[3:43:38] 91Niki: @Towelliee There is an addon for the mission table now. I haven't personally tried it yet tho. https://www.wowhead.com/news=320112/mounts-from-adventure-table-missions-and-venture-plan-addon-spotlight
[3:43:41] Riddlz: They want ppl to take longer to gear
[3:43:42] zaraine1: yeah if it was better than heroic then would make sense for 1 drop
[3:43:54] HumanityDH: no reason to do keys. just afk alts till conq cap catches up then get full 220 gear just by getting 1800 ez
[3:43:58] Steveennnnn: @mrelgaato thank you mate
[3:43:58] Uutef: bringing back valor would be great for m+
[3:44:04] kodtheog: how do you make ur details fade like that the boxes
[3:44:04] Hermon_Hu: Marry Christmas Guys :)
[3:44:07] Gorestack: raid gear and difficulty were almost trivialized by M+ in the last 2 expansions, this was needed

[3:44:16] no_0netv: it just feels bad to be a mythic + player. compared to being a raider only or pvp only player
[3:44:25] Megadisaster24: The only reason is just the mount really
[3:44:27] cahoots82: what's a +15 drop in terms of ilvl now?
[3:44:29] D3m0nHunt3r666: yeah loot is garbo, with chances so lwo
[3:44:36] Scobann: @Towelliee i miss legion m+ s

[3:44:49] feherlofia123: @windnecro pvp is so toxic
[3:44:49] AureliusXV: give two shits about my sanctum
[3:44:54] TheRiwen: you ondt love anima ?
[3:45:01] jure__: considering how underwhelming the sanctum upgrades are, Im not even that mad about anima farming
[3:45:03] D3m0nHunt3r666: bring back legion times, when gear was on every corner towCry
[3:45:03] TheRiwen: you dont love anima ?
[3:45:05] Windnecro: ive bought like 4 backpacks, a bunch of souls for my night fae ability, and have all the upgrades
[3:45:07] Forlagon: EREDAR LORD OF THE BURNING LEGION
[3:45:09] fistiecuffs: Prot Pally as Vent? is it better than Kyrian?
[3:45:09] Windnecro: because pvp gives so much anima
[3:45:12] Xombi: kinda sucks when you dont have time to raid but enough time to run mythic+, cant gear...
[3:45:27] SmokedHog: is there an addon for this yet
[3:45:35] Veras_7: you cant win with venthyr or kyrian, this shit is so broken
[3:45:36] duhworks: theotar
[3:45:37] zaraine1: the healer in the back
[3:45:38] WILLIWJ: I can't wait for an addon for this

[3:46:10] anjin89: ayaleth in middle, she hits two
[3:46:10] Xirmak: then a troop
[3:46:12] duhworks: (theotar) he's the best person we have
[3:46:12] Averegeguy: Happy Holidays man, head looks good towBeer

[3:46:15] maccaruso: Yeah I can't win that fight as Night Fae either
[3:46:16] Aquatic_Sloth: just go night fae LUL
[3:46:18] fistiecuffs: tank top left
[3:46:19] Beave_86: i just completed that on my venthyr, even those the ur hp and attack are less should win
[3:46:19] superdragonbeast: Venture Plan addon
[3:46:22] Beave_86: i went all heros

[3:46:42] cyllos: this is what I did: F= nad, meat, rahel B= theo, ayeleth
[3:46:42] anjin89: but ayaleth middle for mor hits
[3:46:47] fistiecuffs: Stonehead/Meatball
[3:46:48] Cvixx: @Maccaruso Just put in dreamweaver and 4 trappers, you win every single mission
[3:46:49] Xeeshki: and heal up your companions
[3:46:51] kodtheog: meatball is better
[3:46:52] colacrunchie: How did u get meatball and the big wall heroes? Someone tell me plz
[3:46:54] Kuroii_Ck: you dont wanna split damage do you ?
[3:47:01] Ertra: @colacrunchie torghast
[3:47:02] fourseti1234: @chat is there a add on for this companion table thing?
[3:47:07] Windnecro: make everyone hit the same guy to kill them as fast as possible honestly.
[3:47:08] duhworks: he's a damage tank
[3:47:08] Xombi: I heard a dev mentioned on the forums that meatball is the secret to winning this mission
[3:47:14] amayaraven: what addone is that
[3:47:15] Beave_86: yeah i had meatball and ayeleth
[3:47:15] LordKain73: @colacrunchie Torghast
[3:47:18] RootOfImagination: I feel like you want to stack damage on as many single targets, not split it, since they will change targets once the target dies
[3:47:18] Gorestack: Meatball is in Torghast @colacrunchie
[3:47:19] kodtheog: you need a troop
[3:47:21] DaddyWarbuck: yo what addon is that?
[3:47:24] Mallaes: Meatball MAD!
[3:47:31] colacrunchie: @ertra I do all torghast every week and didn’t get. Are they random?
[3:47:34] dirhyn: the addon doesnt take power into account
[3:47:40] dirhyn: thats why its so low
[3:47:43] Mattysaiyan: The weakaura only knows about raw power not powers.
[3:47:46] duhworks: put in meatball
[3:47:46] cahoots82: take out the healer, she's terrible
[3:47:54] Tharoxis: What addon are you using for the table @Towelliee ?
[3:47:54] duhworks: over troop
[3:47:56] WixKT: @Towelliee no there is a trick to it, look it up on youtube
[3:47:56] D3m0nHunt3r666: Maybe Kappa
[3:47:56] anjin89: agreed. healer is meh
[3:47:59] Xirmak: cause this shit is broken... you can load up and it still will not win its like you wont win until they decide ok we can let him now that his followers are 20 levels over
[3:47:59] Xeeshki: why go -3 go -1
[3:48:00] 91Niki: @Towelliee Have you seen this addon? https://www.wowhead.com/news=320112/mounts-from-adventure-table-missions-and-venture-plan-addon-spotlight for the mission table

[3:49:02] CardinalTX: Dreeeeeeam weaver.......i believe you can get me through the niiiiiiiight
[3:49:02] DeanoTV: @91Niki i tried that addon, doesn't help much

[3:49:12] 91Niki: @DeanoTV Oh, rip
[3:49:16] TexValhalla: Dude blizzard legit needs to do something about this shit. It’s so damn dumb
[3:49:17] kodtheog: no meatball is ur best chance
[3:49:21] Tharoxis: What addon are you using for the table @Towelliee ?
[3:49:25] Todmeister9000: go 1 hero, 4 troops?
[3:49:31] GrazzloTV: mission table aficionado
[3:49:31] billybaroo1: which one has bloodlust
[3:49:41] kodtheog: how did you get that soul ash mission? from upgrading the command table?
[3:49:46] Windnecro: dreamweaver isnt the OP part of the strat tho. its the troops with their stacking % damage reduction so nothing does damage to your team
[3:49:48] anjin89: think they intended us to have success on those mission not this early^^
[3:49:53] PyroGambler: PyroGambler subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 29 months! towPurple
[3:49:54] kodtheog: i havent got any soul ash missions yet

[3:50:06] fistiecuffs: @Towelliee why Vent over Kyrian for Prot Pally?
[3:50:34] Kamthrilla87: @Towelliee would you pick the 35% chance to reset avengers for m+ too?
[3:50:37] duhworks: meatball and theotar are the 2 best hero's we have as ven so far
[3:50:42] TexValhalla: @anjin89 but when your characters you’re sending are that much higher than the actual mission and you still lose every time? That’s kinda bs man

[4:25:11] TexValhalla: @nillx_ it wasn’t because they weren’t good it’s because you had the stupidly op classes like mage and dh at the time so they would all just stack those

[4:25:37] mo197: Shade 1/10 M raid?
[4:25:57] wolathus: What do you think about the catchup system in wow atm? @Towelliee
[4:25:57] TexValhalla: @trevybnasty okay so why don’t they? I’m not saying there is a barrier. I’m just saying guilds like them who have dedicated THAT time are better than most because of that reason and not garbage
[4:26:03] mo197: cool gratz
[4:26:11] Lincoln_WoW: @Towelliee you're switching to brewmaster again?
[4:26:13] Nehcrom: Bring The Player not the class.

[4:26:32] ManneehFresh: dont lump all the trolls with echo
[4:26:44] Aldoril: both fanbases were bad
[4:26:44] Nehcrom: So what if the audience is garbage then what? Doesn't reflect on the streamer unless you want it to.
[4:26:51] Forlagon: tbf limit fans were just being toxic in gingi's chat after limit downed denarius
[4:26:51] TexValhalla: I was talking about dh in BfA with someone else @trevybnasty not now in SL
[4:26:54] Nehcrom: People have their own free will, figure that.
[4:26:59] Densetsu_: Define, normal Kappa
[4:27:01] TrowGundam: Ya, I was watching max most of the time and I just had to close chat. Bad people on all sides, it was honestly disgusting.
[4:27:03] thewreckdiesel: not me :)
[4:27:11] josh8555: they were still arguing lol
[4:27:13] Kaihrn: Indeed

[4:27:25] Kromede: there is no normal
[4:27:29] Naturalbeef: I don't care who wins. I just like seeing the insane gameplay
[4:27:29] ManneehFresh: thinking before you type Normal
[4:27:33] fluh_: was pretty convenient to get banned in max's chat KEKW
[4:27:33] Murlocz: @Towelliee What u having for christmas dinner?

[4:27:47] mysteriousm4n: Sadge
[4:27:55] Sh4nti: We lost FeelsBadMan
[4:27:56] wolathus: Doesnt limit get to raid 1 day before echo?
[4:28:05] Domiku: normal as in usually don't have to be an extremist to prove you support something
[4:28:13] Nehcrom: We have certain values we mostly agree upon the rest is just arbitrary.
[4:28:24] noteworthynerd: Gingi congratulated them in chat
[4:28:26] TompsonX: I'm sad that Echo lost, but I loved watching the race, it was the first time I followed a ton of the coverage and it was awesome
[4:28:26] iDystinct: @wolathus 16 hours, but they also had a 8 hour maintenace
[4:28:27] KineasRM: 1 day its 1 day tho
[4:28:32] Murlocz: @Towelliee Roger is shaving head too LUL
[4:28:33] eyemyor: Use a putrid geist 1, stonegrinder 2, same 3rd you have
[4:28:34] yocrux_: I really like Gingi though
[4:28:37] Densetsu_: @trevybnasty If you take it serious you need grow some. ^^
[4:28:38] mysteriousm4n: fuckem dood KEKW
[4:28:42] wolathus: ah I see, thats still super unfair
[4:28:42] Densetsu_: to *

[4:28:45] storm99413: LUL
[4:28:46] yocrux_: that was a real gamer moment
[4:28:47] Kromede: i'm poor in wow, only 1.4 million gold PepeWhy
[4:28:47] DaVeGaLiSoT: So grown up
[4:28:48] Dcarter: I'm all for it
[4:28:52] SpookyPigeon2: he sounds salty
[4:28:55] Fugazi811: You guys realize they’re friends and that was a joke?
[4:28:56] wolathus: blizzard needs to make it so both groups can start raid on the same day at the same time
[4:28:56] TheItalianStallion321: there is much need for it, trash talk is part of it
[4:28:56] pjahj: If you listen to Max after the race, he explained how they took it real personal after their last win
[4:28:57] D3m0nHunt3r666: damn cubans xd
[4:29:01] Aldoril: Yeah but in the moment it was understandable and he apologized.
[4:29:01] eyemyor: Scripe wasnt talking shit

[4:29:08] jaalexba: How is Kungen doing?
[4:29:13] Todmeister9000: was that f you aimed towards echo?
[4:29:13] TexValhalla: Yeah there were a couple in Echo that were stupidly salty yesterday but most of them were really congratulatory about it
[4:29:16] 無職提督: yea, just hope it wont same back to bite him in the future
[4:29:17] fmpr79: Kind of one of those things , EU dominated for years
[4:29:19] TexValhalla: @dcarter POGGERS
[4:29:21] Dcarter: the salt from echo was real after they won so
[4:29:23] Chrisychris1: US just plain disrespectful, nothing new here
[4:29:26] Naturalbeef: THD was in Scripes channel earlier and they were having fun
[4:29:31] KineasRM: what about the 1 day early start?
[4:29:31] TheItalianStallion321: i agree Dcarter, i agree
[4:29:34] ManneehFresh: @Towelliee chat in both channels kept baiting them to say shit
[4:29:40] TheItalianStallion321: Echo is a bunch of sore losers
[4:29:44] Dcarter: I dont mind the moments saying fuck em
[4:29:49] Dcarter: happens
[4:29:56] eyemyor: It wasnt anti-Limit stuff, it was disappointment
[4:29:57] Artivicii: Fuck em PogChamp
[4:30:00] chessboxin34: lol
[4:30:01] pjahj: Not just the BoE and corruption. It was the fact that they said they only won because he RL from the bench. That they got out meta'd and not because Limit was good.
[4:30:02] AtriseOW: EU warrupp
[4:30:06] eyemyor: Nothing wrong with that
[4:30:06] fmpr79: Im cool with EU talking trash but dont get slaty when its thrown back lol
[4:30:13] Moobot: Calm the spam, @TopLegend123 (warning)

[4:30:32] Ryenonn: Genji was whinign imo
[4:30:34] theDirtyon3: Scripe just making excuses
[4:30:39] pjahj: Max said it was disrespectful to Limits players
[4:30:40] eyemyor: Scripe and Roger saying all they can do is deal with whats in their control, nothing else
[4:30:44] Syrion93: Xymox finally dropped HC weapon for me. I have never been this happy.
[4:30:48] TopLegend123: towHi
[4:30:49] eyemyor: Max whines

[4:31:31] CardinalTX: Imagine your greatest achievement being good ay a video game.
[4:31:34] EagleblazeTV: sweet
[4:31:48] Fugazi811: THD was in Echos reaction stream and said F THD hilarious
[4:31:48] Murlocz: I really dont give a fuck tbh, its a competition not a carebear charity Among Us stream
[4:31:55] wolathus: Im a Limit fan but the race isnt fair, 16 hour head start is definitely the difference
[4:31:57] TheItalianStallion321: does anyone have that Nnoggie salt video? that was..HILARIOUS
[4:32:04] MN_Generic: the Drama is so stupid this one of the most intense and fun close RWF ive watched since they started it

[4:32:20] jaalexba: I cant imagine being overly excited and using a soft a
[4:32:22] billybaroo1: can you still change specs in dungeons?
[4:32:24] its_bean92: was that rogue atleast african american? lol
[4:32:24] armybone1: but the n word... that something you dont say when in eush
[4:32:25] playjay82: What model Gunnars are you usng and do you like how they fit?
[4:32:27] TompsonX: It would be so much fun without the headstart because people couldn't give dumb excuses
[4:32:27] TheUnknowing: After 8 days that doesnt matter at all, especially with how fast echo caught up to them @wolathus
[4:32:28] wolathus: but eu had down time as well
[4:32:29] Eekim189: and bugs
[4:32:33] TheItalianStallion321: @Murlocz yes he went completely salt mode on a viewer i think lol
[4:32:33] Coltfever18: the nnoggie clip was deleted already @TheItalianStallion321
[4:32:35] Forlagon: yes
[4:32:37] mysteriousm4n: N OMEGALUL
[4:32:39] TheItalianStallion321: @Coltfever18 i figured
[4:32:45] Forlagon: i think they had bugs on generals as well
[4:32:46] PrimalRain: barely
[4:32:49] eyemyor: Yeah, one for a short bit
[4:32:54] Naturalbeef: The drama creates more buzz and viewers. These guilds love it
[4:32:55] spellrunnerz: Exactly. Didnt NA start at 6 pacific on release day for Mythic, 7 hours after reset
[4:32:58] jasperboy: Limit used that time to splits anyway reee headstart reee
[4:33:00] Malarick: nope Limit Beta tested for them
[4:33:01] ImSyryis: no
[4:33:01] Syrion93: The 16 hours difference only makes HUGE difference when it comes to reset.
[4:33:07] eaglerydr: Max didn’t dis anyone he showed respect and as leader defended his peeps as from the disrespect of Echo. No bugs just their own egos
[4:33:09] vatoloco2355: but i mean come on common sense the first one that goes in gets that lol. they still get the exp with each pull even though its buggee
[4:33:12] vatoloco2355: bugged
[4:33:12] wolathus: yah they did, idk no take aways from Limit at all but there will always be that cloud over them because of the small head start
[4:33:15] holyshackle: who carea bout the first 9 bosses, it call came down to the reset and them both being on the final boss
[4:33:15] Coltfever18: my guild posted it in discord at like 1am and i went to watch it like 10 minutes ago but alas, its gone @TheItalianStallion321
[4:33:25] Dcarter: there is no cloud over a headstart
[4:33:25] TheOGMed: theogmed subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 28 months! 
[4:33:26] jaalexba: Who had the better WeakAura or DBM authors?
[4:33:33] TheItalianStallion321: @Coltfever18 ok cool, thanks! lol i saw it on Max stream and that was it
[4:33:33] inj0shwetrust: I love how EU players try to meme and call NA players their Beta Testers but when NA players best them in a raid race we had a headstart. @Towelliee
[4:33:35] Dcarter: it doesn't matter its a made up thing by people
[4:33:38] holyshackle: but limit was the better guild and they won, gg's to all
[4:33:39] The_Tyrannical_Talkboxx: Didnt echo kill it almost 12 hours after limit did it anyways?
[4:33:47] Snabido: That was fucked up KEKW
[4:33:53] ThePawPaw: Благодарности за 2020Unity, @mayhemguy
[4:33:54] Totemk0: max said that some1 from method said they lost in nyalotha because limit "out-meta" them, not out-performed. thats why limit wanted to win this race so badly
[4:34:00] jasperboy: Im a big time Echo fan, but I cba thinking of the so called "headstart" or w/e. Limit won fair and square
[4:34:01] jasperboy: sadly
[4:34:08] captivate7: have you gotten any mounts from the callings yet?
[4:34:09] wolathus: If Echo isnt complaining about the gap then I guess its ok
[4:34:11] CarrKinn: @Towelliee if you were to start a new main today, what class would you choose?
[4:34:21] Artivicii: I’m rich BITCH KEKW
[4:34:23] mysteriousm4n: close map WutFace
[4:34:23] eyemyor: Well, out-meta IS out-performed, just ina different manner
[4:34:25] Mecabeast: are you rick james?
[4:34:26] Rictamar: Limit are better, proved it twice now, end of discussion lol
[4:34:26] jaalexba: @Towelliee What is Blizzard going to make sure they do not do again?
[4:34:29] overparr: Lol this chat the echo and limit guys are having fun in Scripes chat as we speak there’s more dram an toxicity in here
[4:34:31] Juton09: Hate the conduits
[4:34:32] Malarick: another on the list of annoyances for after Christmas
[4:34:38] akia03: @Towelliee just be glad your bis condiut doesnt come from callings
[4:34:39] theDirtyon3: @Towelliee Did you see Jett invite all the euros to N/A servers next tier?
[4:34:41] DISP0: Giving away those gray items for christmas tomorrow? PogChamp
[4:34:44] MysticalOS: STOP THE COUNT
[4:34:47] TheUnknowing: yeah but you are european right? @jasperboy wouldnt you be shunned or ex communicated if you werent an echo fan boy? Kappa
[4:34:58] RavenARPG: And EU player meltdown as per usual.....like not a single time they are like “hey gg” nope...they self proclaimed “we are EU numba 1”
[4:34:58] dawntreader123456: @Towelliee which tank do you like most so far
[4:35:07] eyemyor: The real salt is the fucking idiots in other chats, not in those guilds
[4:35:12] josh8555: I'm sure they got server first kill though
[4:35:13] killaton423: hey I'm getting into wow is shadowlands good and what class do you think is the best for DPS
[4:35:20] Libbzy: you maining your monk then?
[4:35:23] wolathus: Yah I feel you but considering every attempt counts give Echo another 4 hours and who knows maybe that wouldve been it, idk just wish they would make it so everyone has to be in the same region just for the week WF happens
[4:35:24] SawyerStreamsStuff: its world FIRST, not world FASTER
[4:35:24] Artivicii: ResidentSleeper
[4:35:25] ManneehFresh: too soon lol
[4:35:26] noteworthynerd: Didn't have an 8 hour maintenance, didn't deal with as many bugs, stopped streaming for two days, still lost AND still fanboys are arguing the time difference
[4:35:30] somedudehenry: thatdudehenry subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 3 months! :)
[4:35:31] josh8555: which is a achievement in itself
[4:35:35] TheItalianStallion321: lmao wtf server 1st kill when they are 2nd world...uh....what
[4:35:36] HasjSNAke: LordOfDune Sure, all EU are the same
[4:35:41] Nehcrom: We care about the first tier that much?
[4:35:43] imdonexd: @killaton423 the best dps is the one you have most fun playing
[4:35:53] Kaihrn: Hopefully Pieces get world 3rd
[4:35:56] Coltfever18: echo downed danny boy too?
[4:36:01] TexValhalla: Yeah
[4:36:05] SethSteckler: Yea they got it this morning
[4:36:06] Kyletyldesley: Looking good with the clean shave brother
[4:36:06] mysteriousm4n: OMEGALUL every raid race unless echo is winning then they shut up OMEGALUL
[4:36:06] Thoreya: echo has the best of both worlds. they can just pull out the head start excuse efvery time when they lose
[4:36:07] TheItalianStallion321: Rogerbrown said NO FUCKIN WAY am i going to NA
[4:36:13] SicDogg: what went wrong with method ??
[4:36:13] TompsonX: If they could move for a two week vacation?
[4:36:14] TheUnknowing: catch up isnt hard this expac
[4:36:14] wolathus: yah exactly, I want them to move to NA and just raid so this little debate can end
[4:36:16] Frawg: They're 1 EU guild and 2nd world. Be happy with that. Jeez.4
[4:36:17] Snabido: Inb4 a world first region is made, somehow
[4:36:18] Gnral: convince yourself much as you can but 16 hrs ahead is alot
[4:36:19] KineasRM: Why move if the time doesnt matter, u guys doesnt make sense
[4:36:21] Naturalbeef: The one thing everyone can agree with is that Castle Nathria is an amazing raid tier
[4:36:24] jasperboy: 100% they wont do it this expansion, maybe next
[4:36:24] Moobot: Towelliee is now exclusively streaming on Twitch. It has been a long road! Now we begin a new era for Towelliee Gaming. Thank you all for supporting me for the last 10 years.

[4:36:24] mysteriousm4n: LULW TRUE
[4:36:26] Kromede: "laaag" BabyRage
[4:36:26] TrowGundam: Yep rooKek
[4:36:27] eyemyor: They dont pull out the head start excuse, jesus.
[4:36:27] Archiee: LUL
[4:36:27] Artivicii: Move to NA PogChamp
[4:36:28] Mahal_11532: Its the only solution. NA players went to EU since forever to raid world first, now its time for the flip
[4:36:29] Kyletyldesley: EU lag PepeHands
[4:36:31] Thoreya: i hope so. limit can dust them again for the third time and the excuses wud keep coming
[4:36:31] shilas_gaming: Time zones are US biased KEKW
[4:36:32] josh8555: lol EU lag
[4:36:34] eyemyor: Its the fans whining, not the guild
[4:36:36] jure__: you cant mythic raid with 150ms latency. no way in hell
[4:36:38] Nehcrom: LPB vs. HPW!
[4:36:40] RavenARPG: They will always cry no matter what.
[4:36:45] AureliusXV: tell the EU to get out of our theme parks
[4:36:45] TexValhalla: Yeah they won’t move until next xpac if they ever did
[4:36:46] wolathus: Exactly if they lose while they are all on NA or all on EU then theres no excuse at all
[4:36:47] Murlocz: @Towelliee Dude have u seen the Noggie rage about someone asking him to update MDT? That was true rage shit
[4:36:48] irakem: honestly, EU lag is worse than 16h later start
[4:36:52] Akoudadis: @Towelliee it doesnt matter! its region first! only way to do it world first is to put all major guilds in a lan center
[4:36:55] Thoreya: what do u mean u cant raid people literally raid on other region servers
[4:36:56] wolathus: again im a limit fan, im just stating facts
[4:36:56] Artivicii: LUL
[4:37:01] Thoreya: sloot is in canada and raids EU
[4:37:02] rainvongola: The only thing I don't like about echo is that they copied limit strat for generals and turned off their stream for sire progression LUL
[4:37:05] Thoreya: so that makes no sense
[4:37:10] Frawg: Limit has 3 EU players. One of them is from EU and playing from there.... lol
[4:37:11] Marah57: Next tier limit moves to china
[4:37:11] ravenwingz0405: Gett'em !!! Preach it baby!!
[4:37:14] Graghar77: totally agreee!!! you nailed it @Towelliee
[4:37:14] HasjSNAke: I didnt hear any of the actual players complain, they know what they are up to, it''s people who just want to complain
[4:37:21] Archiee: LUL Eu won't do it cuz then if they lose they won't have excuses or anything to cry about
[4:37:28] Frawg: And he's the MT>/.
[4:37:34] noteworthynerd: Limit had three Europeans in the raid
[4:37:39] Thoreya: just sayin its not impossible
[4:37:39] Bajors: Caeayaron
[4:37:39] Kromede: towOny SoSnowy
[4:37:40] SicDogg: ony
[4:37:44] pharmaticus: limit has EU raiders, one was a main tank. I think they would be fine
[4:37:46] pjahj: Limit did it before when they raided at Redbull in London
[4:37:47] Texas_Mizfit: echo sire strat didnt work they had to copy limits
[4:37:49] Artivicii: NA east isn’t too bad
[4:37:49] duhMarSeeYa: ONY <3
[4:37:52] Thoreya: but echo can pull out the headstart excuse everytime when they stay on EU
[4:37:53] SamDavidsin: ony short for onyxia?
[4:37:53] pjahj: The ping was fine
[4:37:54] Thoreya: so its a win win for them
[4:37:57] Syrion93: if only people could take it for what it is, an amazing race head to head that resulted in the better guild to win. I am Echo fan but Limir is insanely good and they deserved it.
[4:37:58] TompsonX: It would be pretty cool for there to not be be a headstart, even if it doesn't actually matter advantage wise, but because people would stop giving excuses and I bet more fun would be had by everyone
[4:38:05] wetfinger: yes ofc
[4:38:06] mayhemguy: she can hear him
[4:38:06] WarriorMuffins: oh ya
[4:38:06] Nehcrom: Yeah they do.
[4:38:08] vatoloco2355: really? ya
[4:38:09] Kromede: magic
[4:38:09] Aldoril: exactly Sambo
[4:38:11] Jarless: yeppers
[4:38:12] SpookyPigeon2: yes
[4:38:15] Firedexx: Roger Brown is shaving his head now
[4:38:17] Thoreya: also Limit literally went to London for azshara and raided on NA servers
[4:38:18] Gnral: only in na Kappa
[4:38:18] Thoreya: with no problem,
[4:38:19] letrickyxd: @Thoreya only Scripe does that, none of the raiders pull that
[4:38:20] aros603: Sound
[4:38:24] MysticalOS: hear maybe
[4:38:25] Beave_86: probably heard it
[4:38:26] CrimsonNurse: When are you moving?
[4:38:27] PrimalRain: yep they have crazy smell
[4:38:29] MysticalOS: superior hearing
[4:38:30] Artivicii: 6th sense
[4:38:31] Nehcrom: No air going in our out...
[4:38:32] Thomakos_Gr: if no air how you breath?
[4:38:36] ArcaneMaki: Ony already gone
[4:38:45] SpoofAvatar: dope dogs can smell drugs in cars that are all sealed up in containers
[4:38:45] WarriorMuffins: dogs smell 100,000 to 1,000,000 timer better than humans
[4:38:48] josh8555: idk people were arguing just to argue lol
[4:38:50] eyemyor: lol, Rogerbrown is legit shaving his own head on stream right now
[4:38:51] Nehcrom: Sounds like a HERMETIC sealed room.
[4:38:52] Syrion93: "Almost" lol
[4:38:57] Archiee: but latency, right!? LUL
[4:38:59] Nehcrom: Like where noone could breather.
[4:39:00] SpookyPigeon2: it isnt air tight (like a jar), some air comes in and out of a window
[4:39:00] AlpineKitty: My cats know when my Dad is turning onto the street. Their ears perk up and they jump up to the window to watch
[4:39:02] KineasRM: we cant speculate until they're playing on the same plane field
[4:39:04] Graghar77: If they would of doing world first based on time played.. Echo would of beat Limit hands down
[4:39:07] Texas_Mizfit: limit would of beat ashara if it wasnt bugged
[4:39:20] Murlocz: If they lose they would blame the lag
[4:39:21] KineasRM: the fact is that there are a time gap
[4:39:30] TompsonX: They wouldn't, no
[4:39:31] noteworthynerd: Agreed, Echo should have to deal with the maintenance and bugs too @KineasRM
[4:39:32] Eekim189: Its -40 F outside for me, good day to stay inside
[4:39:35] Dcarter: based on time played LUL
[4:39:35] killswiitch: Nope
[4:39:38] TompsonX: Which means there's 3 contenders!
[4:39:40] Elkahira: @Towelliee what's the cursor while combat addon?
[4:39:42] Dcarter: what kinda logic is that
[4:39:44] mysteriousm4n: who cares OMEGALUL
[4:39:49] Nehcrom: No one cared about this until Method started losing.
[4:39:53] Artivicii: Probably not
[4:39:56] PrimalRain: no, the same happens in dota and nobody cares about that part
[4:39:59] Artivicii: Yah
[4:39:59] chrischeatle1989: @Towelliee is shadowlands worth returning to wow for ?
[4:40:01] eyemyor: Should have to deal with this, should have to deal with that. Both areas have their own things to deal with, fuck .. quit whining.
[4:40:03] Firedexx: they have Exitlag as a sponser so they'd be ok
[4:40:04] josh8555: lol @dcarter I was thinking the same thing
[4:40:04] SpookyPigeon2: Im admiring your haircut
[4:40:04] TompsonX: Hell yeah, i'm raiding at that point Kappa
[4:40:05] noteworthynerd: @KineasRM Literally all of Echo and other EU guilds say the time difference doesn't matter. You're arguing a point that the people actually competing say doesn't matter lmao
[4:40:08] Thoreya: i cannot stand the time difference thing my skin literally crawls whenever someone brings it up lmao
[4:40:12] CardinalTX: its like baseball....."world series" only in us
[4:40:21] Murlocz: @Towelliee Or Limit can wait until EU reset to start the race
[4:40:24] Xirmak: How about a real world first race and they are all on the same server much like a neutral filed
[4:40:35] pooranoia: why do they have to prove anything to limit their on eu servers
[4:40:37] skeetersfly: Until the raids are a global release, the world first needs to be a timed event.
[4:40:39] Kaihrn: Just open raid same time world wide so the chinese can get stuck in to :D
[4:40:51] Frawg: Limit is just that good. Hands down.
[4:40:55] Dcarter: the world first race is fine
[4:41:02] Thoreya: a timed event.
[4:41:03] Thoreya: lmao
[4:41:03] iDystinct: Wonder what server they would come to, they would also loose alot of fan boys to buy boes/run splits
[4:41:03] purpgarma: monkaS that whole mess
[4:41:04] noteworthynerd: Ok, well NA has to deal with maintenance and bugs the other regions don't, so how do you "even" that out @skeetersfly ?
[4:41:08] Taylormade2711: it cant be timed... limit has to deal with bugs almost no other guild has to deal with...
[4:41:10] Dcarter: people just complain about stuff they know nothing about
[4:41:18] aros603: Method trash without Gallywix LUL
[4:41:19] Murlocz: Nnoggie is mad af with 2nd place
[4:41:19] letrickyxd: Global release is wanted by everyone. That's the only thing that can make it better

[4:41:35] Murlocz: @aros603 What happened to gallywix?
[4:41:39] IGett: I would like Echo to actually do what limit did and get an big org behind them
[4:41:41] Artivicii: LUL
[4:41:42] letrickyxd: @Murlocz RMT
[4:41:45] Thoreya: why is echo competing for world first if its such a disadvatange. wouldnt limit just win every single time?
[4:41:48] TompsonX: Why doesn't Blizzard do global release though? Is it infrastructural or do they just not give a fuck
[4:41:55] Basinod: Taking a day off from viewership they HAD to win
[4:42:01] Murlocz: What did he said?
[4:42:02] SethSteckler: @TompsonX They don't give a flying fuck
[4:42:07] eyemyor: Nnoggie is a hothead, thats for sure

[4:43:15] skeetersfly: @noteworthynerd That's a good point. At the end of the day I just want to see a global release.
[4:43:17] wolathus: Perfectly said, these guys making bank gaming whats there to be so upset about legit
[4:43:27] psykkomantis: you can mount for that
[4:43:48] TompsonX: I actually really like the Maw now!
[4:43:49] noteworthynerd: Me too, that's what everyone wants, including Limit and Echo, but the time difference fanboys love to argue about is offset by the bugs, maintenance, etc @skeetersfly
[4:43:51] TompsonX: I didn't at first
[4:43:55] PToastman: lets go to the maw....today
[4:43:57] LoremasterMarthan: Id rather sit in the maw all day than have to do M+ right now.. good lord
[4:43:58] Havoc_Sinistr: Rather see method over echo
[4:44:01] Artivicii: Quoting dr evil while bald LUL
[4:44:11] eyemyor: The "make bank gaming" thing isnt really a thing, unless you're streaming. The guys getting "paid to raid" dont exactly make a lot of money
[4:44:18] squirtreynoldstv: @Towelliee just wanted to wish you and the Hammer Squad a Merry Christmas. Thanks for everything buddy.
[4:44:20] psykkomantis: i do it right after clicking the bell
[4:44:30] mayhemguy: lol Echo had a 0% wipe on Sire before they killed it
[4:44:31] josh8555: Didnt Limit have to reclear while Echo was still doing denathrius the first time?
[4:44:34] wolathus: they make plenty of money are you delusional @eyemyor
[4:44:35] Graghar77: All Echo is .. is bunch X method players bailed on Sco..
[4:44:42] aros603: IF you are happy when you lose your are not competitive....WFR would be boring to watch if no one was trying
[4:44:48] Murlocz: Hes angry with people asking for MDT all the time LUL
[4:44:49] HasjSNAke: Its a winner mentality
[4:44:52] TheItalianStallion321: they are the Yankees, they cry b/c they dont win
[4:44:53] wolathus: yah exactly he just wanted to win but hes still making a shit ton of money playing wow
[4:44:54] TheItalianStallion321: plain and simple
[4:45:05] 345kiwi: true @Shaddex77
[4:45:06] eyemyor: @wolathus The guys that dont stream do not make a ton of cash. Its not a fat bankroll for that by any means.
[4:45:08] Gnral: butter or oil which one is better for bald head
[4:45:08] JeemTeam: making a shit ton of money?

[4:48:05] Zulamun: @billybaroo1 Yep. The way I see it is that this is free entertainment. A sub or a donation is to me the same as netflix or buying a movie. If I enjoy the content and have the funds to spend, I will donate or sub to be able to get more of said content
[4:48:07] RakwaXD: @GameFreekTV I was responding to the person that says nobody in chat has to worry about payroll.

[4:53:32] MysticalOS: nice to finally see engagement from curseforge
[4:53:33] Nimz83: I thought Limit was Shure, but idk
[4:53:41] noteworthynerd: Nope, Limit was Blue
[4:53:44] Karbonn: yea big names. Herman Miller sponsored Limit too.
[4:53:49] Mattyboh: @towelliee but limit had there mics front and center and echo barely showed them off.
[4:53:56] xavier2119: Its hard to argue with numbers and statistics
[4:53:57] TexValhalla: Yeah Max said he’s gonna have to talk about shutting off the streams and shit with there people for next tier. I don’t blame him tbh. I feel like if there biggest competitor(s) do they should be able too as well. But that’s just me
[4:54:00] TheItalianStallion321: @Nimz83 limit was blue
[4:54:02] Nimz83: Limit is probably based on Complexity agreements. I would think
[4:54:03] Schmubbs: I'm surprised that wasn't already in the contract
[4:54:03] Zulamun: If you have a good product,it's a win-win. Might as well just sponsor both, no competition
[4:54:07] PrimalRain: that's what I see happening
[4:54:10] imdonexd: limit had blue mics and headphones for their guys who wanted them
[4:54:13] TexValhalla: @nimz83 they are
[4:54:13] SkiptomyLew: Herman
[4:54:21] rosina_scarlett: I can see that happening
[4:54:22] 345kiwi: Echo shot themselves in the foot by cutting off the stream
[4:54:35] Artivicii: Numbers talk
[4:54:41] Ndrewx: i believe that's already how it is
[4:54:44] pacokoi: Yeah honestly seems kinda weird that they make a huge competition, get huge sponsorships, advertise it as streaking the race to world first, and then SHUT OFF STREAM. So weird
[4:54:44] Nimz83: @GrittyTexan At least Jerry Jones is winning with something. My poor Cowboys, lol
[4:54:45] LordKain73: Didn’t echo end up using limits strat in the end anyway? Lol
[4:54:49] ottavianni: or put penalties in contracts
[4:54:50] Nehcrom: "Pleb" streamer, lol.
[4:54:50] CADZtv: lmit not sponosred by blue i dont see any sponsor banners by blue
[4:54:54] nomad_91: @towelliee like when that iNascar driver raqe quit and it pulled his sponsors logo off Fox for the rest of the race so they dropped the driver on the spot
[4:55:05] TexValhalla: @nimz83 you and me both but Jerry don’t know shit about this though KEKW
[4:55:12] Mastermind1429: max was talking about that and he said he will want the ability to not stream and discuss that with his sponsors
[4:55:17] Zulamun: @LordKain73 Wouldnt surprise me with limit having a days headstart
[4:55:23] NexusOps: @Towelliee I don't see how these contracts can get as specific as that. The suits signing the contracts would need to know what is the "most important part of the race". If anything there would be a more general clause like "stream every time you enter raid"
[4:55:24] noteworthynerd: @Towelliee Max was asked about this last night. He said that if their competitors are going to be doing this, he may have to talk to Complexity and their sponsors about this
[4:55:25] daddy_dolby: yeah they were
[4:55:27] Thoreya: limit had blue sposnored
[4:55:29] mysteriousm4n: they were
[4:55:30] Archiee: yeah
[4:55:32] vairi0n: They were
[4:55:32] MankiGames: There were literal "Blue Listen In" sessions lolol
[4:55:32] Thoreya: max had it under his screen
[4:55:33] AnunnakiOnYT: Yes they were
[4:55:36] pacokoi: They went offline for sludgefist didnt they?
[4:55:37] josh8555: yea they were
[4:55:37] Dcarter: limit was
[4:55:37] noteworthynerd: @JAYMURCS It's literally on the RWF announcement
[4:55:37] DBMambo: IT WAS ALL OVER THEIR STREAM lul
[4:55:38] Nimz83: @GrittyTexan 100% true. This was just an investment between him and some real estate guy
[4:55:38] TheItalianStallion321: they ALL had blue mics in the studio
[4:55:38] D3m0nHunt3r666: Limit were sponsored by them
[4:55:38] Archiee: they all had the world of warcraft yeti at the event
[4:55:40] letrickyxd: echo had logi sponsor
[4:55:40] CADZtv: oh i dnno then
[4:55:41] Mahal_11532: he had the crazy Blue headphones on too
[4:55:42] MOLAR305: blue sponsored limit
[4:55:47] Dcarter: wtf are better getting this from
[4:55:47] PrimalRain: it was under max'es camera
[4:55:49] Jarlan23: on the main commentating stream they talked abotu blue all the time
[4:55:53] bosseja: @Towelliee i wanna reroll a tank, how it feels now? better or worse than BFA?
[4:55:54] Gizmoudo: the broadcasters kept talking about Blue and Herman Miller non stop so
[4:55:57] TheItalianStallion321: max i think had the $1000 blue mic that Towelliee has
[4:56:00] Nimz83: I think it was just a commercial for Shure
[4:56:01] SkiptomyLew: @Zulamun 4 pulls difference. 4 pulls is not 1 day
[4:56:08] EagleblazeTV: I wonder about the WoW Yeti X
[4:56:10] im_n0t_jezus: yeas
[4:56:10] noteworthynerd: @JAYMURCS "Complexity-Limit will welcome Blue Microphones, a leading innovator in audio technology and design, as the guild’s official microphone partner
[4:56:11] TexValhalla: They were absolutely sponsored by blue
[4:56:21] yocrux_: yes they were because I used their banner to buy a mic for my daughter
[4:56:50] MysticalOS: have comms, for real, people don't want to hear casters they want to hear the raiders
[4:56:51] AnunnakiOnYT: He spoke about this yesterday, they share revenue, it doesn't matter @Towelliee
[4:56:54] TompsonX: TRUE LULW They fucked up
[4:56:55] zaraine1: then josh happened
[4:56:58] mmrghost7: rip
[4:56:59] MysticalOS: people are in max's stream fr comms
[4:57:01] Jarlan23: idk max gets a lot of traffic on his channel. it would help him more in the long run
[4:57:06] bosseja: feels bad man dude
[4:57:06] Archiee: yeah that was all bc of the casters though
[4:57:08] pacokoi: Method would usually get more viewers in the last few tiers at least
[4:57:19] vairi0n: @Towelliee Did you watch the complexity channel at all? Cool people i bet but just listening to the casters was cringy
[4:57:25] noteworthynerd: Max gives 70% of the money he makes to the guild during RWF
[4:57:31] gimmlay: OTK world first worse commentators lmnao
[4:57:34] gimmlay: lmao*
[4:57:35] Archiee: Why not just put Max on the complexity channel
[4:57:37] pacokoi: Complexity-limit shows and red bull one were both decent though
[4:57:37] robertjordan83: @Towelliee max splits his revenue from his channel during rwl with guild
[4:57:42] no_0netv: max gives most of the earnings to the guild
[4:57:47] robertjordan83: *rwf
[4:57:50] Graghar77: lol
[4:57:57] skdmaster: I gotta sayMzx
[4:57:58] parlondo: parlondo subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 8 months! \
[4:57:58] yocrux_: OTK really blew it sadly, asmon talked about it.last night.
[4:58:03] pjahj: Max revenue shares his stream from RWF, I think last time it was 70%
[4:58:20] DadBodDave: !weakaura
[4:58:20] jure__: OTK is fine, it was their first go at it, no problem.
[4:58:21] Karbonn: That's just fair compensation tbh. Makes sense.
[4:58:22] mysteriousm4n: OTK was fun for about 1 or 2 days then I stopped tuning in NGL
[4:58:23] Jarlan23: yeah he otk thing wasnt that good. too many dumb skits
[4:58:24] pooranoia: do they wipe ur ass
[4:58:24] names172: @yocrunch whatd he say
[4:58:30] skdmaster: I gotta say Max is the most calm raid leader ever
[4:58:31] Frawg: Max gives 70% back to the raid for all revenue during the World First Race.4
[4:58:32] pooranoia: god damm
[4:58:33] eyemyor: OTK had some really great ideas. They need to rope it all together on the coverage side of things.
[4:58:39] bosseja: richt is fucking anoying dude
[4:58:41] Archiee: it was hot garbo
[4:58:42] Aldoril: IMO the commentary was the problem. It was easier to follow, understand the pulls and you hear all of the calls. Much more interestin gto me.,
[4:58:45] SkiptomyLew: They would need better casters too
[4:58:49] MysticalOS: Az said that complexity had a management team manging ads on ALL limit channels, by hand. running ads etc
[4:58:50] Davediggity25: Towelliee Im a huge fan of how good a guy u r plz respond to my Grindr message
[4:58:50] solsaver12: They sure do
[4:58:52] RunningOutOfRAM: "I didnt troll" LUL
[4:58:54] gimmlay: they barely covered it
[4:58:54] feherlofia123: rich and asmon carried the show
[4:58:58] SkiptomyLew: i like dratnos but tettles is a snob
[4:58:59] RakwaXD: First time it was entertaining
[4:58:59] D3m0nHunt3r666: useless stream tbh :P
[4:59:01] PrimalRain: I feel like they got uninterested or something later
[4:59:02] DeanoTV: barely even covered the race lol
[4:59:02] N3llee: yea their things was a shitshow
[4:59:03] SteeeeelReign: some parts were alright but I was cringing so hard
[4:59:07] Malarick: yeah. was rough
[4:59:07] MysticalOS: the OTK thing was a joke. how do you do world first coverage but only stream like 4 hours a day
[4:59:08] robertjordan83: @Towelliee didnt seem like they were trying to be professional grade, just funny entertaining
[4:59:10] Jarlan23: they didnt really cast tho. it was card openings and shit i dont wanna watch that. i want world first coverage
[4:59:12] CardinalTX: OTK was a clown show......I could do that shit in my own garage
[4:59:13] yocrux_: @names172 he just said it could have gone way better and needs to be planned out way more.
[4:59:13] jasperboy: They just need to stop fucking around and doing stupid shit and opening pokemon cards
[4:59:13] Gorestack: a bunch of sweaty bros fucking around, what a stream
[4:59:16] SkiptomyLew: hearing max pov is cool too
[4:59:17] wolathus: yah it was lowkey trash lol
[4:59:17] eyemyor: If they dedicate to casting, they have the people for it. Rich is great, and Asmon himself is amazing. It just needs to be dealt with properly.
[4:59:18] sk5p: Both Complexity and Echo Sports comentators sucked, Max's stream is better
[4:59:18] pacokoi: Their show was decent for just hanging out and trolling around. They werent going for serious commentary and it showed
[4:59:24] MysticalOS: and 2 of those 4 hours are usually frat partying instead
[4:59:24] itsagentscully: 2/10
[4:59:27] Gravity16: Complete gong show 2,5/10 is generous
[4:59:28] Sh4nti: OTK event was just random stuff mish-mashed together with barely any coverage
[4:59:30] Kaihrn: 5 mins i tried and i was OUT of there haha
[4:59:31] no_0netv: i dont think they have the ethic to do a race to world first unless they hire out all the talent
[4:59:31] killswiitch: I enjoyed it
[4:59:33] Gizmoudo: yeah I tried to watch it, but it was mostly "Fuck chat" and random vids of them doing stuff
[4:59:34] solsaver12: exactly
[4:59:37] Wildside1177: It was a variety show during a world first race.
[4:59:40] Masham96: Rich is a great caster and host for esports event, but they heavily tried to push OTK content over the actual WF race
[4:59:41] kislikss: @Towelliee sou 2020 = Rip method guild :D dor ever :D weee it was good year :D
[4:59:41] bosseja: true
[4:59:44] rosina_scarlett: BDGG had better casters then echo and limit xD
[4:59:44] Naturalbeef: Asmon and Rich are incapable of being over the top cringe
[4:59:48] wolathus: like they are entertaining people but it was literally an asmon stream not a WF stream
[4:59:51] Purplestuff1: otk was the most low effort bs I had seen in a while
[4:59:55] SteeeeelReign: rich is always trying to do these weird play on word segways into other topics it was fucking annoying
[4:59:57] yocrux_: I agree 5/10, Asmon is an actual great commentator when everyone around him isn't being sperg lords
[4:59:58] pacokoi: Plus they stopped the day before the win. Crazy
[5:00:04] wetfinger: But that was the point of OTk stream
[5:00:05] dankifide: its more entertainment than anything
[5:00:07] destroyerofantep: towe do you drink drpepper
[5:00:07] solsaver12: I felt bad for Tips...he seem out of place during it all
[5:00:09] Sh4nti: Cash app is a scam LUL
[5:00:10] CardinalTX: Rich campbell is dead weight and will kill anything OTK could be
[5:00:12] mysteriousm4n: it felt like an IRL event with some RTWF coverage thrown in instead of the other way around @Towelliee
[5:00:13] Davediggity25: im sorry but Rich is fucking annoying
[5:00:16] gimmlay: You need mythic raiders to cover it...
[5:00:17] SkiptomyLew: if you didnt care about the race and just wanted shenanigans it wasnt a bad coverage
[5:00:17] Thomakos_Gr: asmongold is the most fun wow streamer
[5:00:17] dankifide: asmon is like the WWE of combat sports
[5:00:20] pooranoia: just say circus
[5:00:21] Kaihrn: All About Me Craft Campbell
[5:00:22] SoChipper: i thought the analyzing of the different groups before the event started was okay
[5:00:23] JiberishUI: Buuuuut they had a super successful show
[5:00:25] yaattess: yeah, but they also had 100k+ viewers for most of the time. soooo
[5:00:32] HasjSNAke: LUL
[5:00:40] yocrux_: I did win $50 from cashapp lol
[5:00:41] JiberishUI: @yaattess yes hahah it was a huge success
[5:00:43] pacokoi: They said at the beginning they would do the whole race then they just stop LUL
[5:00:46] Sh4nti: They had less viewers than Asmongold normal streams LUL
[5:00:46] solsaver12: no , their viewers dropped
[5:00:50] Forlagon: i liked their streams. not for the coverage of the race but just the other stuff
[5:00:51] Jarlan23: @yaattess they didnt tho. it was below asmons normal viewer count at the end
[5:00:52] yaattess: @Jiberishxd exactly...
[5:00:55] Masham96: let Tips and Rich actually produce the content as it it was being commentator on and make a real higher effort product
[5:01:03] solsaver12: First day had good viewers..and it kept dropping
[5:01:06] SteeeeelReign: @yaattess no they did not
[5:01:06] MysticalOS: yaat, those were OTK viewrs, people just there to see asmon and mizkiv, but not people there for race
[5:01:11] Sh4nti: True LUL
[5:01:14] yocrux_: Asmon was upset about that, his crew voted to end it
[5:01:20] HasjSNAke: It started of promising, but went south fast
[5:01:22] D3m0nHunt3r666: only the first day was okay...cuz ppl didn't realize what it was about LUL
[5:01:23] Chrisychris1: thats still a high number tho
[5:01:24] Gluwc: Yea for me I don't care much about the race so I enjoyed their stream
[5:01:27] Sh4nti: 20k-25k during his peak stream time
[5:01:29] D3m0nHunt3r666: they ran out ideas
[5:01:29] Sw4tpunk: They had the stream split upon multiple accounts
[5:01:33] Jarlan23: the guild interviews were good though
[5:01:33] eyemyor: They have the capability to do very, very well. They just need to put it all together.
[5:01:35] solsaver12: true
[5:01:43] killswiitch: I agree
[5:01:46] FullTiltFrozen: It went south at the first 'game show'
[5:01:48] Davediggity25: speaking facts
[5:01:58] Sh4nti: Asmongoloid fans are reaction watchers, they don't play or care about WoW LUL
[5:02:00] RakwaXD: The interview with the German guild was really funny.
[5:02:04] Panadol324: otk is a joke and nothing special
[5:02:04] ebone45: LUL true
[5:02:06] 345kiwi: LUL
[5:02:08] pacokoi: It was so ridiculous that it was on Asmons channel. I like Asmon but this was the perfect event to launch OTK with
[5:02:11] itsagentscully: YESSSSSS
[5:02:12] showmethesugar35: otk is cringe as fuck
[5:02:14] Jarlan23: yeah i dont really care to watch mizkif talk about WoW
[5:02:17] ebone45: working out the bugs
[5:02:19] Jarlan23: or at all
[5:02:20] osheait: moofzy was there
[5:02:21] twistedstick1: But the OTK channel will not get the views that Asmon gets.
[5:02:22] holyshackle: kinda hard to get people traveling with covid though
[5:02:24] N3llee: yea their show was just hot garbage.. walking around in socks and shit
[5:02:27] wynot232: or just watch Max
[5:02:29] CardinalTX: OTK sill just be a meme in a couple months
[5:02:31] brain_wash: Rich needs to settle down on his false over laughter, omg
[5:02:32] yocrux_: They need more quild interviews, boss breakdowns, and stuff associated with the race. the little they did was great
[5:02:33] Bloodshed_1723: I like there content a lot but they really dropped the ball on the race
[5:02:37] RobbJH: Rich covered ghuun for method
[5:02:39] Sw4tpunk: Watching them destroy 1st gen pokemon cards got me tilted
[5:02:40] eyemyor: Preparing was needed. They did spectacular prep on some things, but not for the casting itself.
[5:02:44] cahoots82: No one is tuning into OTK for real coverage. They're just tuning in because it's OTK
[5:02:44] Romanesca1: hey at least naxx is hard Kappa
[5:02:46] solsaver12: absolutely
[5:02:46] Davediggity25: Rich is crazy cringe
[5:02:46] pacokoi: @twistedstick1 Not at first but it’s about building it up. If they want all their own separate channels then they don’t need an orgw
[5:02:48] Skeezitz: its literally a degenerate meme stream
[5:02:49] MN_Generic: asmon fans lmao
[5:02:53] Karbonn: Yea the commentary was pretty cringe and way off base a lot of the time.
[5:02:53] xavier2119: yeah a lot of it was cringy to watch lol I usually had it on, but just muted and turned on sound if they were talking wow
[5:02:56] pavepawns: otk was so boring
[5:02:58] motorboatingpro: It seems like preparations A through G failed them.
[5:03:02] ironfist625: Tuned in for a breakdown and saw a video of them in a wrestling ring so I tuned out lol
[5:03:02] feherlofia123: @davediggity25 rich is the best part of otk
[5:03:03] Gluwc: @Towelliee I don't think they pretend to be the best analysts. They just want to mess around.
[5:03:05] yocrux_: Well Asmon is really the only WoW player in OTK lol
[5:03:07] RunningOutOfRAM: Exacly LUL
[5:03:10] Masham96: Rich legit knows how to run these types of events which is a shame. could really have been used to launch OTK network with wow
[5:03:11] Gorestack: lmfao too true
[5:03:11] Lif3l3ss: yeah definately felt like a content grab more then a Race to world first coverage. Day 1 seemed promising after that i couldnt even watch it.
[5:03:12] RunningOutOfRAM: SO TRUE LUL
[5:03:12] imallin1234: Lmao so true they talked about anime for like an hour at one point I was like wtf am I watching
[5:03:15] theDirtyon3: LUL
[5:03:20] wolathus: its true
[5:03:24] Panadol324: Asmon can only get one special guest , pinkSparkels to tell how to put plastic in there body's :D :D
[5:03:27] pooranoia: lol
[5:03:38] pacokoi: Taking a tax break still means they spent more money then if they just held onto it though
[5:03:38] BriscoGDP: as if taking tax breaks is bad lol
[5:03:38] mysteriousm4n: LUL
[5:03:41] ebone45: that wrestling stream was cringe AF lol
[5:03:41] Sals_a: They didn't have a plan
[5:03:43] Davediggity25: @feherlofia123 lol k, his viewership definitely represents that
[5:03:44] eyemyor: When Asmon actually sat down and spent his time casting and not fucking around, he was amazing. If he really put a lot of prep into that, it would be great.
[5:03:45] mysteriousm4n: they need to take commentating shifts
[5:03:45] letrickyxd: they don't have the attention span at all
[5:03:47] names172: ad mid convo :(
[5:03:49] Forlagon: Amon looked dead from the inside half the time
[5:03:50] Incredible_Sausage: it felt like high schoolers trying to put on a show.
[5:03:54] SirMaldo: "LETS FUCKIN GO" - Maeveycakes
[5:03:55] D3m0nHunt3r666: esfand is busy with Jinny Kappa
[5:03:56] Nitrosulphur: @eyemyor Correct
[5:04:00] Slowscythe: Hi Sinead O'Connor:D
[5:04:02] yocrux_: I think they will do better next time, especially with the PvP tournament with their team hopefully
[5:04:06] Hank_ish: italus27 subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 7 months! 
[5:04:06] FengornTwitch: @Towelliee Com'on man. 7 adverts
[5:04:10] wolathus: Esfand was great, Mizkhif and rich were too cringey for me to watch
[5:04:12] Klax99: oh yeah ... ad break mid discussion ...
[5:04:12] Mahal_11532: tbh Rich creeps me out and its only a matter of time til he gets #MeToo'd
[5:04:13] superdragonbeast: best time fora n ad lol
[5:04:18] Nehcrom: He is being very constructive let the fanbois rage.
[5:04:24] solsaver12: It coulda been setup like how they do Allcraft..with 4 windows
[5:04:29] kkage_ryuu: ad though i'm subbed? thats new
[5:04:30] GilianoGVK: how come ad sounds is so loud?
[5:04:31] Davediggity25: @Mahal_11532 lol seriously
[5:04:35] pavepawns: BDG was a good coverage i only have 1 minor issue. and that was the immediate cutaway to casters when boss died. we didnt see loot or anything :(
[5:04:38] Zulamun: I really liked the OTK casting, but you're right.. either cover it, or don't. Asmon actually was great as a caster. I also really liked the side events, but, exactly, side events. I liked most of the content, just.. either/or
[5:04:42] Murlocz: Darkee reaction is only a smile LUL
[5:04:46] TexValhalla: There were definitely times Conplexity did the same. Tettles for one on there side was sooooooooo cringe at times. But for the majority of they time they did way better at actual coverage
[5:04:47] Secondbreakfasttt: sha mount woulşd be louder aLUL
[5:04:47] eyemyor: Put Tips and Azmon on casting for OTK next time, it would be spectacular.
[5:04:49] Towelliee: https://www.reddit.com/r/Asmongold/comments/kj12q1/otk_race_to_world_first_event/

[5:05:49] SoChipper: did people downvote your post to oblivion?
[5:05:58] no_0netv: no stream during the only boss that matters...
[5:05:59] mysteriousm4n: which ones?
[5:06:09] Thoreya: jeez
[5:06:13] LiteralZero: who's he talking about?
[5:06:19] yocrux_: @towelliee he talked about it last night on his personal stream. I think things will change, he seemed really disappointed

[5:06:40] Feanorian: Are you pissed or just offering advice?
[5:06:50] fatbytes: problems in the house, rich went back to new york
[5:07:00] KingSlayerYotam: maybe he talked about what he thinks on zackrawr channel, we need to wait for him to return
[5:07:02] GoodEnough4Me: OTK won't last for the ego reason alone
[5:07:02] Zulamun: Asmon admitted it was a mistake to do it on his channel
[5:07:08] MOLAR305: Pokémon cards...
[5:07:08] Seerated: People don't forget stuff like that, next time they'll have that in mind and just go to another stream
[5:07:12] hunterxp: lol
[5:07:15] SteeeeelReign: seemed like not was everyone else wanting to promote their own shit on his channel and wasn't his idea
[5:07:17] gimmlay: ya its a joke to WOW
[5:07:18] Karbonn: Yea THAT was mega cringe.
[5:07:20] pacokoi: TRUE. Especially cause leading up to it they kept saying they would go until it’s over, and it would suck but they would push thought if it lasted a month. Then that didn’t happen
[5:07:21] PincushionTV: PincushionTV subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 3 months! 
[5:07:25] solsaver12: ya I got confused with it all
[5:07:32] thecynicalshuffler: non stop sex jokes from rich was very cringe
[5:07:36] eyemyor: It some manners this start was really bad. In some ways though, this was good. It was good that they found out the hard way, that they learned a hard lesson. It is good that they are self aware enough that they know it has to be fixed.
[5:07:37] Murlocz: @Towelliee He still have hard feelings for Jokerd having the world of warcraft views record on Classic first lvl 60
[5:07:42] jason_tacey: The boys are young they'll figure it out
[5:07:44] D3m0nHunt3r666: you think? Kappa
[5:07:45] Erendyr: Asmon said on his second stream that he wanted people to be home by christma which is a part of their reason for stopping early - dunno whether to believe that or no
[5:07:46] gimmlay: hopefully no guilds let them use their content
[5:07:49] SpoonManes: who rage moded
[5:08:02] Stars_Eternall: do you think they will even try it again ?
[5:08:03] letrickyxd: OTK will learn, but nothing could ever be expected about hwo to handle a BUSINESS/BRAND from basement dwellers LUL
[5:08:03] yocrux_: Sex joke sex joke bad take sex joke yayaya uWu
[5:08:13] RunningOutOfRAM: Basically they have to bring people to work for them .. I don't think they are grown mentality enough for that ;D
[5:08:13] Murlocz: @thecynicalshuffler Cant stand that rich guy, 0 funny
[5:08:14] TheItalianStallion321: but that shoujld have been common sense from the beginning to not do it on his own channel. you dont build a brand and dont make the brand logo twitch channel
[5:08:16] GoGetItKo: This used to be a Ratropolis stream FeelsBadMan
[5:08:21] Dankind64: gachiHYPER ?
[5:08:25] zurdo85XIX: where can I read up on all the drama?
[5:08:29] MOLAR305: do it on otk channel have asmons channel host
[5:08:33] Secondbreakfasttt: @yocrunch LMAO
[5:08:33] solsaver12: and it needs to be some what professional lol
[5:08:39] kargren192: BaldTOW
[5:08:41] Gravity16: Couple of the individuals are creeps, huge turn off
[5:08:44] SpoonManes: geeks rule the world
[5:08:44] useless_ezreal: they are who they are and quite frankly we had a great time @towelliee, I don't understand what you expect from people who are just streamers like you, be super pro and all comon man
[5:08:48] cschwartzy: The content was super cringe IMO
[5:08:49] yocrux_: asmonWHAT asmonWHAT asmonWHAT asmonWHAT
[5:08:51] Sw4tpunk: Asmon does not have that much job experience. Hopefully he doesn't burn bridges with sponsors too early.
[5:08:57] pacokoi: They keep saying that it’s cause of viewership that they stream on Asmons or Mizkifs channel but they don’t realize they’re trying to build a brand they need to stream on an OTK channel
[5:08:58] Zulamun: @Towelliee Asmon said earlier today it was a learning moment. They thought on his channel they had more clout/reach instead of making a new OTK channel, and also that only him and rich really knew anything about the raid, so that was wrong as well. He thinks it was a failure as well
[5:09:01] Azg0th: I feel sorry for Tips out sometimes when I watch him. Feels like he busts his ass and the other get to have fun and not worry.
[5:09:01] pavepawns: it was rly sad to see there was so little actual content regarding to world first on that stream.
[5:09:08] solsaver12: lol
[5:09:16] Murlocz: @Towelliee He still have hard feelings for Jokerd having the world of warcraft views record on Classic first lvl 60
[5:09:19] KnsWoW: @Towelliee they should hire you as a stream consultant
[5:09:26] Wildside1177: The team is so different. I am not a watcher of all of them.
[5:09:30] names172: you know whats super cringe? rogues, fuck rogues
[5:09:31] RakwaXD: Yikes egg nog
[5:09:31] Ryenonn: That Mzkif dude was cringe asf
[5:09:34] letrickyxd: I think esfand tried his best to carry the actual WoW aspect, but the rest were actually useless
[5:09:35] Shizzanagi: Also consider that there were likely people hanging out just for giveaways
[5:09:39] DadBodDave: !addons
[5:09:40] Moobot: We have a new, updated Towelliee SL UI! | wowinterface.com/downloads/info23265-TowellieesTankUIElvUI169.html READ ALL THE INSTRUCTIONS CAREFULLY OR IT WONT WORK.

[5:09:41] wolathus: They are good individually, put them all together in one room its just too cringe Mizkhif trying to promote some pokemon shit in the middle of the coverage like wtf
[5:09:44] RakwaXD: I was rooting for Big Dumb Guild
[5:09:45] KingSlayerYotam: why would he have bad feelings about jokered?
[5:09:47] EggwithEdges: I'd listen you, you've been on streaming scene really long time
[5:09:47] HasjSNAke: They went so fast from the start, solid group
[5:09:49] KingSlayerYotam: no reason at al
[5:09:50] RakwaXD: Their videos are great
[5:09:52] aros603: CPT Morgans spiced goes really well with eggnogg
[5:09:58] eyemyor: Mizkif didnt need to be a part of the wow stuff
[5:10:05] Spaydex: @Towelliee Whats even the point of covering world first for that long? Maybe its just me
[5:10:06] KnsWoW: you should KEKW
[5:10:14] SteeeeelReign: well their team is built for short funny clips not long drawn out discussions of intellect
[5:10:17] Wildside1177: Their viewer demographics are very different in OTK I bet.
[5:10:22] pacokoi: It’s fine if Mizkif is involved he’s in the org, but they should’ve had more time for actual WoW players
[5:10:24] StitchNGlitch: Straight up. I always started my day there but then quickly switched off due to the inconsistency and dumb side things going on...
[5:10:26] Murlocz: @Towelliee Fatsharkyes is really impressive, they only raid 5 hours a day and its amazing
[5:10:26] TheItalianStallion321: i said from the beginning, that organization wont last its 5 friends who decided to join into a business venture. i see no real ambition to make it profitable
[5:10:34] ScrubbzTV: the amount of merch spamming they did was bad lol every 2 to 5 mins was something about buy our merch
[5:10:37] AureliusXV: OMEGALUL TK
[5:10:38] SpoonManes: would rather see someone like swifty than rich, js
[5:10:41] jerseyfive: get dratnos
[5:10:41] yocrux_: I just couldn't watch because I generally wanted to know what was going on, Limit and BDGG had the best imo
[5:10:44] Jarlan23: think about this. the only person on that show that plays retail consistently is asmon and he doesnt do mythic or m+ even
[5:10:51] Zulamun: @eyemyor He didnt really want to, but its the first real event they did as OTK, so they all joined, and found it, it didnt work in the end
[5:10:51] xXxEntropyxXx: yea it was an obvious cash grab.
[5:10:52] SmokedHog: they are boring AF though
[5:10:53] ruyagezgini: they have "actual raiders"
[5:10:54] TheItalianStallion321: Mizkif is....a big joke IMO
[5:10:54] wynot232: Still Max was the best stream
[5:10:55] Gluwc: I wasn't really expecting hot takes from them to be honest. I enjoyed their stream for what it was.
[5:11:13] Gorestack: it was like General Forum stream LUL
[5:11:18] Mahal_11532: you're gonna get brigaded by his fanbois now
[5:11:21] eyemyor: @Zulamun They need to separate the content.
[5:11:22] Kaihrn: anything with rich n tips i will never watch tbh they both have terrible self obsessed egos
[5:11:26] cschwartzy: IMO if you watched it and thought it was good, you have no concept of what good is lul

[5:11:28] Ergotismm: And the fact that OTK are a bunch of awkward man babies.
[5:11:29] Fayrgrus: asmond barely knows how to do his basic rotation xD
[5:11:34] SteeeeelReign: and rich trying to make play on words every 3 minutes
[5:11:35] xhale2nhale: for me Max/Limit streams were the best, the entertainment they were giving was so great
[5:11:38] SteeeeelReign: was so annoying
[5:11:39] names172: @Marellas tips was jsut promoting and ad breaks every 10 mins
[5:11:39] solsaver12: yes
[5:11:40] Mightbeworth: is blood dk in an ok place right now? @Towelliee
[5:11:42] TheItalianStallion321: @FetusChrist__ lol
[5:11:52] kylern58: do we really even need OTK to cover the RWF? we have each guild doing it with their own professional casts and thats far more compelling to watch
[5:11:53] crescens22: did you watch lightee talk about tanks? @towelliee
[5:11:55] KingSlayerYotam: tbh only asmon really plays wow from all of them, Its weird they tried even
[5:12:02] RakwaXD: Cashapp was the aftershow
[5:12:02] aros603: Rich became super annoying
[5:12:07] eyemyor: Max's stream was awful, but it had coms and it had coverage of a coach perspective
[5:12:15] Artivicii: Cashapp towSellout
[5:12:15] eyemyor: So that drew people
[5:12:16] RaidbossTV: would be good to see Towelliee commentate RWF
[5:12:16] TheItalianStallion321: @kylern58 they tried making a name for themself....it failed, somewhat
[5:12:24] Zulamun: @eyemyor Agreed. Asmon himself said he thinks it failed. They didnt think it through for the actual race to wf
[5:12:31] wynot232: It's a lot of stupid stuff, but with max you get the teams stupid stuff and the game
[5:12:34] Dexkc: Rich was so anoying with his buččshi, bad sex jokes etc
[5:12:39] SpoonManes: to me rich seems fucked up sometimes, not a sustainable model, meh
[5:12:45] yocrux_: Thier interview with BDGG was really good, I watched their stream because of it and didn't know who they were before. they need more.of that next time
[5:12:46] DatRippelEffect: i got what i expected out of the otk stream. had quite a few laughs
[5:12:48] CardinalTX: Rich is 100% cringe.....just rides Asmons nuts
[5:12:48] herpderpdoublederp: would you ever join OTK?
[5:12:53] Zulamun: I enjoyed the content, but only the side shit haha, actual race to world first I swapped channels
[5:12:59] SoChipper: How do you stream the race? Do you just show footage from another channel who is participating in it?
[5:13:06] TheItalianStallion321: Rich looks like a pedophile....
[5:13:07] eyemyor: Rich is an amazing talent, he just needs to get his shit together.
[5:13:07] pavepawns: rich and tipsout for me were rly weak. esfand was 50/50
[5:13:12] theDirtyon3: you would do great towel
[5:13:13] Ergotismm: @TheItalianStallion321 It's true. Their actual social and communication skills are awful! Aside their personas and out the comfort of their own streams.. they're idiots
[5:13:18] Jarlan23: youd be better than what we got
[5:13:22] theDirtyon3: youd be John Madden KEKW
[5:13:24] RunningOutOfRAM: the old dog tow dont bends his tail Keepo
[5:13:24] yocrux_: When they started opening up pokimon cards I was like aiiighhtt I'm out lol
[5:13:24] Zulamun: When they actually did the casting, it wasn't bad
[5:13:28] fatbytes: they need snoop next tier
[5:13:29] Dankind64: tony da goat
[5:13:37] jaysteea: oh so we have echo at second place i see
[5:13:39] SpoonManes: snoop lion mon
[5:13:39] Kalidin79: @theDirtyon3 LUL
[5:13:44] TheItalianStallion321: @FetusChrist__ i cannot agree with you more, i really cant
[5:13:53] Kaihrn: Preach is defo a natural at that shizz lol
[5:14:01] dreadhaven34: digging the cut. merry Christmas!
[5:14:01] theDirtyon3: @Kalidin79 hahahahhah
[5:14:02] Zulamun: Yeah. Either do raid world first, or do some OTK christmas event.
[5:14:02] pavepawns: preach is a rly good commentator
[5:14:10] Jarlan23: i mean you would have been a better commentator than mizkif lmao
[5:14:17] Zulamun: They did have interviews with quite some guilds/raiders
[5:14:17] CardinalTX: I see Esfand and all i think is.....FFS buy a GD hair brush
[5:14:20] Libbzy: 'thats a bold strategy preach let see if it plays out for them'
[5:14:22] AureliusXV: @Towelliee whats your take on no class stacking in MDI?
[5:14:24] barnanimal: OOOF
[5:14:26] KingSlayerYotam: if they wanted to make a game show, i think they will be better off. They should stay away from WoW for a while
[5:14:27] mysteriousm4n: LULW
[5:14:30] Archiee: Truth hurts LUL
[5:14:31] mysteriousm4n: LULW OOOOOOOF

[5:14:38] wolathus: nope its 100% true
[5:14:43] SpoonManes: in the feelsss ugh tis just a flesh wound
[5:14:43] pavepawns: weirdly enough i kinda wanna see pikaboo try to commentate a raid world first cause just his commentating on arena's are mesmerizing
[5:14:45] TheItalianStallion321: its literally 5 moronic friends who decided to pool Asmongold's $$ together and start a business
[5:14:46] names172: or maybe retail wasnt good before?
[5:14:51] SpookyPigeon2: thats funny cause its true (they spit on retail till it paid)
[5:15:01] pacokoi: To be fair retail is better than it has been in awhile imo
[5:15:04] xXxEntropyxXx: honestly hope Asmond and Estfan re-think the whole OTK thing. Wasn't good
[5:15:04] TexValhalla: Echo should totally have Henry Cavill as a guest at some point. Being a huge wowhead he is AND being in the EU I guarantee he pays attention
[5:15:08] barnanimal: his wife preggo
[5:15:12] xhale2nhale: nah he was telling the truth but the truth hurt some
[5:15:15] KingSlayerYotam: is a shy guy and he wanna focus on his life and chiled
[5:15:17] gorilla_quantistico: because staysafe doesnt want to move to texas @Towelliee
[5:15:19] SpoonManes: does vin diesel still play? lol
[5:15:20] Sals_a: He wanted to stay independent
[5:15:23] solsaver12: Staysafe lives in Oregon tho
[5:15:26] Fermilat: Staysafe is kind of a long wolf.
[5:15:27] Sw4tpunk: staysafe is classic mostly I thought
[5:15:30] ThresherXG: m,izkif is an annoying fuck
[5:15:31] eyemyor: I'd like to see AutomaticJak do commentating on RWF

[5:15:59] yocrux_: I was suprised they didn't have Belluar, preach and stuff. The national championship pet battle with Hazle was good.
[5:15:59] Ergotismm: It was hilarious when within the same stream, Asmon was flaming the majority of the community, telling them to put the effort in to find a guild, thats the only way you can succeed in the raid, 2 hours later.. he literally cried and shut down his stream because his 'warrior sucked' and the PUG RAID couldnt beat sludgefist
[5:16:01] TheItalianStallion321: @dondickrleone are you serious? 150%

[5:16:09] TheItalianStallion321: @dondickrleone asmon never spends any $$
[5:16:10] DatRippelEffect: think Staysafe is moving to Germany soon after Kathy has the kid
[5:16:16] Kalidin79: @kylern58 i dont know what they might be, but ive seen him say things i massivly disagree with
[5:16:16] jason_tacey: LUL I thought it was relaxing?

[5:58:58] twistedstick1: you prob need a designer to work with the contractor.
[5:59:02] Masham96: there is a standard rate and market value for that kind of stuff, if they lowball it you may end up having costs run up and go overbudget or receive a suboptimal experience
[5:59:02] Wildside1177: Get previous work references and speak to them. People who they did work for.
[5:59:08] Gozach: ill do your room for you, ive seen a hammer before

[5:59:20] wynot232: wouldn't Terry know someone?

[6:00:20] idenkaz_: you hire a company that knows what you want without you going with them :D
[6:00:21] stormbear7: @Towelliee if you get 3 bids, lowest one will typically be missing something you want
[6:00:22] yocrux_: most contractors have portfolios, look for one that specializes in media rooms
[6:00:24] Meshindale: use code TOWEL at checkout for 30% off yhome materials
[6:00:26] JayyDogg: Also if anyone asks for $ upfront for materials dont ever do it

[6:01:20] nicknacking5: newark is reall ghetto lol
[6:01:21] ricklessness69: safest bet is an Interior Designed
[6:01:22] fatbytes: california has some weird ass contractor laws
[6:01:34] idenkaz_: you need a designer first. thats were you start. go from there.
[6:01:39] Slicerv: zaqHi happy holidays towelliee

[6:02:16] knifeparrty: you can sketch it then give to them they can then sketch something to your liking

[6:02:34] Masham96: theater in the past*
[6:03:09] Mauraderss: Multiple quotes and concrete start and finish dates, and no money up front is my best advice. A designer isn’t a bad idea either

[6:10:17] R0NGG: they had arm in on every foght
[6:10:19] ricklessness69: rallying cry was just too big
[6:10:20] letrickyxd: arms warrior was in Limit
[6:10:21] toobaked1987: @towelliee that rare drops a tmog?
[6:10:21] killswiitch: so sad
[6:10:24] Highmen3: But battle shout in a hunter/unh dk stacked raid is good
[6:10:27] Highmen3: :(
[6:10:28] ricklessness69: arms is middle of the pack dps
[6:10:33] Leemster30: but I love fury.. makes me sad
[6:10:34] dankifide: because once a warrior always a warrior bro
[6:10:37] TexValhalla: yeah arms is mid
[6:10:38] CrimsonNurse: No rogues too rip
[6:10:41] noteworthynerd: Correct
[6:10:43] Riddlz: the AP buff is the only reason
[6:10:44] Armdel: Echo had a arms warrior in the top 5 on their kill i believe
[6:10:44] amayaraven: hey had an arms warr
[6:10:44] TexValhalla: but i play fury
[6:10:48] barnanimal: yeah
[6:10:49] himynameisalex5: It's weird seeing Warrior as mid tier DPS
[6:10:49] amayaraven: they*
[6:10:50] barnanimal: Atrocity
[6:10:50] VarkanosGaming: plus dk have a brez
[6:10:53] samsherril: they had two
[6:10:54] TexValhalla: and fury is absolute dog shit in terms of dps
[6:10:54] Highmen3: no just the prot
[6:10:55] Nakrim: yes
[6:10:55] sirhotstreak: prot only
[6:10:55] noteworthynerd: They did for Battle Shout and Rallying

[6:10:59] samsherril: one arms and one prot
[6:11:00] Wintersteel: But they had an Amrs warrior in the kill though
[6:11:00] Fayrgrus: yes 1 arms warrior
[6:11:01] Highmen3: so they did have 2
[6:11:06] R0NGG: it's because most of the damage is physical in nath
[6:11:10] amayaraven: yes
[6:11:12] grizzlyhorn: the rallying cry conduit makes it DISGUSTING, like 30% increased potency
[6:11:15] ricklessness69: ITS GARBAGE
[6:11:20] illuminationpaladincurse: havoc is SHIT
[6:11:22] Fayrgrus: but they regreted bringim him, Max said they would have ran 2 WW monks instead

[6:11:39] Highmen3: Arms does not need a nerf tho LOL
[6:11:41] DustFlap: hunters and UH will be tapped down a bit
[6:11:43] jeneraljelly: No probably not unfortunately
[6:11:43] ricklessness69: fury is getting a 5% str buff supposedly
[6:11:43] Highmen3: We just got MS buff
[6:11:49] MarshallOnline: boomkin need neref mroe than unholy DK
[6:11:51] sirhotstreak: monk is so op with gear now
[6:11:54] phiil__: UH DK doesn't need another nerf
[6:11:56] FaceMcShooty: WW monk is nutz
[6:11:57] jeneraljelly: Seems like they dont like doing mid tier tuning stuff
[6:11:59] theDirtyon3: Trill a god
[6:12:00] Asuo_: No way AMZ dosen't get hit - it solved world first pulls
[6:12:01] Nakrim: trill's good but ww is also nuts
[6:12:02] DadBodDave: What addon are you using for your healthbar? @Towelliee
[6:12:03] TexValhalla: bro fury got absolutely destroyed at the end of beta
[6:12:03] PrimalRain: just boost up the underpowered classes/specs imo
[6:12:03] Tyrandian: Tyrandian subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 29 months, currently on a 5 month streak! Bald is beautiful, fam! Grats, Limit!
[6:12:05] SimplyRed: monks are always good at the start of Xpacs
[6:12:07] derekrh: UH DK do need another nerf
[6:12:07] Ryenonn: Fury has to tab target to mantain high aoe dps
[6:12:10] ricklessness69: trill is way too fucking good lmao
[6:12:10] xImmortalGodx: @Marshall_Online how do boomies need a nerf?
[6:12:14] xImmortalGodx: we have burst thats it
[6:12:15] himynameisalex5: I want to believe that Blizz will fix the other classes and not nerf the ones performing well, but history says otherwise...
[6:12:15] shifty86: Trill is a beast
[6:12:27] derekrh: 4 UH DK in mythic raid is a prime example why
[6:12:29] SimplyRed: the aura needs to be addressed to make sure they scale well into the rest of the xpac.
[6:12:30] Short_Film: Trill in the WoW hall of fame
[6:12:33] CrimsonNurse: I’m always a fan of buffing the classes that need them and leaving everyone else alone
[6:12:33] theDirtyon3: Rank 1 PvE and PvP the SAME DAY
[6:12:40] DustFlap: they need to increase the CD of AMZ
[6:12:42] sirhotstreak: someone made the joke that phase 4 was trill
[6:12:43] bkb888: That dude went from world first to rank 1 last night
[6:12:49] Zander_TheGamer: They don't need to nerf them, they just need to buff the underperforming classes. To many nerfs in this game and not enough buffs.
[6:12:50] TexValhalla: i don't think that certain classes/specs need a lot of nerfs but others without a doubt need buffs
[6:12:50] shifty86: WW gonna be everywhere and people gonna be salty because it’s Trill who is the beast
[6:12:51] evanxlviii: I think we’ll see a lot of WW not doing shit in raid now xd
