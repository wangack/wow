[2:13:05] Alcarcalimo: yea
[2:13:24] W34f: well its gonna go there unless we kill ai completely
[2:13:25] D_N_T_: AlphaGO did for sure
[2:13:33] Garishimo: Our entire purpose was to make AI and had the torch to them Aware
[2:13:43] Garishimo: *hand even
[2:13:43] 99_bears: Aware
[2:13:48] W34f: who is to say that inside a corp they regulate anything
[2:13:53] SeriousJester: AI is out of the bottle, you cannot fight it, you will not win
[2:13:57] RommieD: the most disturbing thing about AI is that every derivation so far has answered the question "what is the biggest problem with the world" saying "there are too many human beings"
[2:14:02] Nani_GW: I remember the dota 2 AI shitting on all the pros in a 1v1 mid like 8 years ago
[2:14:08] callmetedddd: it will DELETE US
[2:14:09] SiliconDeath: then at that point is it no longer AI and just the I
[2:14:12] coffeeatm: @MightyTeapot Did an A.I not beat Pro players in matches that played LoL, after it learned from 100 of thousend matches againast it self and players
[2:14:33] CambeulnoOni: my Wife lost her Job to AI a few years ago
[2:14:36] Koori_89: all the pros learned from it, but that's crunching numbers, something people never did, there was no challenge for the human to overcome. The AI had a constant challenge "get better "
[2:14:43] tytorrezz: What we have that AI doesn't is a limited life - maybe if AI did the heavy lifting in society, humans would have more time to enjoy the limited time they have @MightyTeapot
[2:14:47] trigisawesome: i dont believe in strong AI because i believe its premise is flawed KKona
[2:15:09] colonelraide: are the skyscales in wow better than the gw2 skyscales?

[2:15:40] Byrchi: Hmm 17 man
[2:15:44] Koori_89: we are electrical impulses and pheromones

[2:16:23] eyxx: @W34f who cares if "humanity" is flesh or metal
[2:16:23] ciraxa: @eyxx not really a problem, we come up with something else to be better at or die trying
[2:16:25] Snebzor: @Alcarcalimo Hmmm have we heard any reason why? I only noticed it now.
[2:16:29] redcobra_II: ironically most of your behaviours are decided by your gut biome
[2:16:29] knotapastry269: this doesn't look like guild wars
[2:16:33] Alcarcalimo: no idea why
[2:16:35] eyxx: if they retain individuality what's the matter
[2:16:45] HeisenTwT: RELICS

[2:17:35] eyxx: @W34f nothing i guess but i really don't care that much in the grand scheme of things, almost seems like the next evolution of humanity
[2:17:42] eyxx: human+
[2:17:50] crowdyxx: ai gonna use humans as fuel source
[2:17:56] D_N_T_: if we ever manage to define hat consciousness is, then *maybe* we'll be able to direct AI there. Until then we are nowhere near what a human brain can do.
[2:17:57] W34f: @ciraxa but the point is that they are in every way better than us so why keep us while we induce harm
[2:18:08] redcobra_II: INHUMAN REACTIONS
[2:18:09] Koori_89: @MightyTeapot impossible reaction times as well
[2:18:11] SeriousJester: Im not a Tindral enjoyer

[2:19:24] Nike_DnT: there are still plenty of 3rd worlders to outsource your job too
[2:19:28] D_N_T_: A human brain does a trillion things all at once expending 20 Watts. Current AI models are good in one narrow area each, and require KiloWatts of energy and datacenters to function

[2:21:25] W34f: @ciraxa well yea but we have an opportunity to stop this before it goes that far so do we take the risk of convenience or deletion... it seems to answer is clear as day because everyone wants to be lazy but the results will prolly be anything but

[2:23:23] Frostball99: phase 2 roster will be interesting
[2:23:27] itsky_syrup: the fuck is this roster
[2:23:30] W34f: f?
[2:23:34] itsky_syrup: why is there a ww monk
[2:24:18] ciraxa: @W34f true we could try to stop it (unlikely because some people will keep trying to make AIs), on the other hand this could help humanity take the next step just like industrialization had many bad aspects but ultimately helped us live longer and better.
[2:24:28] Emperorh: I'm the god of hellfire and I bring you: an ambulance, we're going to A&E!
[2:24:54] Byrchi: monk not using tigers lust on himself?
[2:25:05] W34f: @ciraxa the funny thing about living longer is that we have limited resources and if we dont regulate how many ppl are born then we are fucked
[2:25:07] Edeslash: @Byrchi stop backseating
[2:25:10] Edeslash: keskity raidiin
[2:25:24] Alcarcalimo: NOTED p1
[2:25:25] Byrchi: I'm just scared for my fellow monk gamer
[2:25:38] itsky_syrup: tigers lust is a self cast or unbind situation
[2:25:40] Nike_DnT: how many more days would it take if this was blind prog
[2:25:50] Nike_DnT: and not following these presorted strats
[2:26:00] MightyTeapot: not gonna lie, next two are kinda intricate, would take way longer
[2:26:02] Byrchi: well thats never gonnna happen
[2:26:05] MightyTeapot: multiple weeks longer
[2:26:07] Byrchi: unless you're top 2 guild
[2:26:29] Edeslash: only blind prog is real prog (like dagda CM)
[2:26:49] W34f: @ciraxa also as we were discussing before. losing jobs etc. ai is gonna replace a lot of stuff so how are those replaced going to be living after? its good to think about the opportunities but the gain of 1 shouldnt superseed the well being of many
[2:27:09] Umbra_ivara: what makes WoW fun? Never played it

[2:31:35] toggla: lets kill boss
[2:31:39] Byrchi: Its so loud
[2:32:18] ciraxa: @W34f we say that we dont have enough resources, but most of that is caused by mismanagement, wasteful usage and political reasons. AI would be helpful in managing our resourcess better because its way better at working with multivariate problems. Of course jobs will be lost due to rationalization and eliminaation of useless positions. The massively increased productvity could alleviate most of that if society/polictics were open to stengthen social security systems such as adding UBI.

[2:35:58] W34f: @ciraxa i think its very utopistic to think that the whole world will start to operate equally and even if we start increasing productivity how do ppl who dont have jobs pay for anything? theres already huge issues in many countries with ppl living on the streets and it seems to be getting even worse. Also work conditions are fucked in almost every country in some aspects so yea...

[2:36:55] Umbra_ivara: @W34f sounds like a dystopian to me
[2:37:16] W34f: @ciraxa also a big thing here is that the corps are the ones developing the AI tech. not countries so they have pretty much free hands to make whatever they want and who is to say how they develop their tech behind closed doors
[2:37:49] Edeslash: i think its very utopistic to think that the whole raid will start to soak seeds equally and even if we start increasing dispel productivity how do ppl who dont have freedoms run for root stack? theres already huge issues in many players with doing ZDPS and it seems to be getting even worse. Also raid conditions serve zero purpose in almost every Tarren Mill guild in some aspects so yea...

[5:26:36] eyxx: 11 looks so fucking bad
[5:26:47] tomdotdll: win 10 is the goat though
[5:27:12] tomdotdll: you can customize win10 a lot
[5:27:14] aFlyingGuru: i would prefer a rusty screw through the ballsack to mac os
[5:27:22] W34f: @tomdotdll 10 is almost the same as 7. 11 is complete ass. apps that you dont need, the ui elements are dogass and hidden and worse naming system
[5:27:23] eyxx: i hated 10 home but idk if it's as bad anymore, moved to pro like 4.5 years ago
[5:27:44] tomdotdll: @W34f get rid of everything you dont need then lol
[5:28:14] W34f: @tomdotdll the question is why does it come with that shit in the first place and not have it clean without it and you can install it after
[5:28:46] W34f: @tomdotdll also you cant change the ui elements that much unless you download some custom skin
[5:29:01] kransarka: why would u use windows if ur gaming it takes so much ram to run itself + all the garbage windows defender u cant turn off etc. linux superior
