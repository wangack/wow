[1:07:59] nahchofam: hellooooooo
[1:08:04] makkoftw: if u play flanking strikes u want 2.0 pet
[1:08:11] PermaGrinnn: you not in communal gear, so you got that going for you
[1:08:12] mealtiime: doing the god work with that sting
[1:08:25] TheBeastIncarnateF5Reigns: BM is actually the best Spec because your pet isnt uselss all the time
[1:08:35] pollisand: just get a 39 one, ridge huntress
[1:08:38] stayinmytrapm8: in raid grp it doesnt give you that much xp
[1:08:42] stayinmytrapm8: solo or party
[1:08:47] relodilodingdong: uldaman solo
[1:09:09] Diculas: @Ziqoftw For pvp you're probably better off as full BM imo. I'm doing a hybrid BM/Surv build for my melee hunter, got down to intimidate and 1 focus regen no spirit bond, and the increase damage talents 3/3 in surv and the imp raptor strike talent 2/2
[1:09:58] shadowz04322: When you see a big red cat in pvp: Deadeg
[1:10:00] stayinmytrapm8: bm it is
[1:10:05] VacaSlamBang: scope on a bow ICANT
[1:10:11] citricxy: @ziqoftw bro you remind me so much of my stepdads son it’s crazy the resemblance
[1:10:12] Copiumpusher: water gun
[1:10:19] shadowz04322: Warriors when they charge the melee BM hunter: "i have made a grave mistake" monkaH
[1:10:22] makkoftw: bw wind serpent is scary
[1:11:04] jorreboi: I like surv for entrapment with trap launcher
[1:11:19] Diculas: That's gonna be like 25% of peoples health in BGs
[1:11:25] Kirby_The_Pink: peepoPls
[1:11:27] makkoftw: hunter discord approves ws > cat with nature debuff. also ranged bolts in pvp kinda nuts
[1:11:40] SpiritEX: trap launcher is so op
[1:11:44] muunfyre: the Lone Wolf rune should remove the hunter and just be the pet tbh
[1:11:53] makkoftw: both
[1:11:59] SpiritEX: KEKZ
[1:11:59] GrandmMaster: @muunfyre KEKW
[1:11:59] Slinky309: im behind you bb
[1:12:05] al3c: it's called a druid
[1:12:12] Kirby_The_Pink: monkaS
[1:12:14] pollisand: perma eyes of the beast
[1:12:15] al3c: :(
[1:12:36] jorreboi: IT's a surv angle
[1:12:44] von0Essen: Jokered did earlier, worked fine
[1:12:45] Kevnxd: its decent, maybe 60% of melee damage
[1:12:47] jorreboi: Entrapamento
[1:12:55] SpiritEX: KEKZ any mana leech talents?
[1:13:24] jorreboi: ye full surv is el cracko
[1:13:47] spacecowboyr: the trap talents are better than 10% hp honestly
[1:13:57] GreenLizzardx: no
[1:13:58] spacecowboyr: you can get 3 frost traps out at once with that extended duration
[1:14:05] tannydanner: imp monkey..?
[1:14:05] makkoftw: imp revive pet is almost must in pvp xd
[1:14:07] Diculas: @Ziqoftw I did BM to intimidate and 1 focus regen, then surv to imp raptor strike (but i went a PvE angle too and took beast slaying instead of parry)
[1:14:07] spacecowboyr: the entrapment is so insane
[1:14:09] MrChrisJoe: 4 / 5 on slow cat or 3 / 5 on fast cat
[1:14:33] tannydanner: you're gonna want imp revive pet at least
[1:14:39] zdrdan: pvp? go surv and stack stam
[1:14:40] Diculas: @Ziqoftw You dont want to dodge against a warrior
[1:14:42] saund: what do you think will be the most braindead spec people gonna abuse in next tourney?
[1:14:51] shadowz04322: bm = giga cat that just shreds people, surv = be a massive annoyance in pvp, survivability and still good dmg
[1:14:51] spacecowboyr: spirit bond is trash
[1:14:59] CoccolinoDeep: 15% crit is technically 15% more damage , since crit is double dmg
[1:15:04] GatzuNL: take 1 off from monkey
[1:15:08] niku_baku: bestial wrath is so strong
[1:15:14] spacecowboyr: 2% every 10 seconds is nothing
[1:15:32] Crunchycarrott: @Ziqoftw starting sod today thinking of running a druid. lock or mage for pvp stuff which u recommend?
[1:15:51] spacecowboyr: yeah I get up to 5k in a bg
[1:15:56] SpiritEX: so 400 regen every 10sec KEKZ
[1:15:57] tannydanner: survival gets that much from the 10% stam talent
[1:15:59] spacecowboyr: but its still not worth lol
[1:16:02] zdrdan: i have 4.6k in ab buffed KEKZ
[1:16:11] GatzuNL: dodge = less dmg so no heals needed for that
[1:16:11] desst1: spirit bond is dogshit
[1:16:15] spacecowboyr: I don't even use the 10% hp talent as full survival cause the other utility is so good
[1:16:21] zdrdan: nvm now i have 5k we have a war too
[1:16:46] Krallzboy: BM is the play 100%
[1:16:48] Kirby_The_Pink: vibeSaber
[1:16:48] shadowz04322: crit damage
[1:16:58] MrChrisJoe: full mm + lone wolf
[1:16:58] shadowz04322: but full mm is a bit greedy its mostly just damage
[1:17:04] TORTELLUCI: MM seems pretty el dogo
[1:17:13] hobbehesu: LICKA entrapment
[1:17:23] mynde01: put points in multishot
[1:17:26] spacecowboyr: I tried that build, liked full survival more
[1:17:27] von0Essen: been trying mm untill scatter and then rest in survival for entrapment
[1:17:28] shadowz04322: DankNoted
[1:17:34] Kirby_The_Pink: DankThink
[1:17:44] medskie: entrapment is OP af, so annoying
[1:17:54] Diculas: @Ziqoftw Lone wolf probably hope for aimed shot crits, otherwise master marksman on chest is more crit, lion some good stam
[1:18:07] Tmbojangles100: yooooo
[1:18:09] Tmbojangles100: how we doing
[1:18:34] Kirby_The_Pink: SCATTER
[1:18:38] Diculas: @Ziqoftw for MM i would rather use expose weakness with trap launcher and hope they dont come in melee
[1:18:44] plsnojebait: who isnt playing with weapon chain?
[1:18:51] shadowz04322: yes surv hunter hardcounters rogue tbh
[1:18:51] makkoftw: weapon chain doesent work on it
[1:19:03] shadowz04322: tanky, disarms, kiting
[1:19:03] medskie: yes
[1:19:04] zdrdan: yes
[1:19:11] zdrdan: not many ppl have it
[1:19:14] zdrdan: but its good
[1:19:15] spacecowboyr: full survival with all the trap talents feels the best, once you get the 30% increase on frost trap its amazing.
[1:19:17] makkoftw: hunter disarm is not coded properly and weapon chain doesnt work on it
[1:19:25] medskie: i have it in offhand on rogue
[1:20:34] TORTELLUCI: crazy cock tail
[1:20:42] Agonistt: yo what's good
[1:20:57] booddhi: looks good
[1:21:01] Seoken1: actually improved aspect would also apply +attack power to your pet, so you could do ONLY 5 pts in that and it would be a solid increase of dps
[1:21:11] djzou: wtf you are druid with this
[1:21:14] Vir0n: aone freedom and your build is useless for 10 sec
[1:21:18] kb_h: bean is playing like this I think
[1:21:20] Seoken1: yup
[1:21:23] spacecowboyr: the thing is as survival you can fight in melee and ranged with the right rune set up
[1:21:27] Seoken1: oh sorry attack speed lol
[1:21:34] Copiumpusher: send 1 into trap %5 hit chance
[1:21:38] spacecowboyr: so you don't need every root, just entrapment feels good enough
[1:21:43] djzou: cshero is the next char?
[1:21:43] Diculas: No>
[1:21:51] JonnyBrainstorm: Chatting
[1:21:53] viqu21: no
[1:22:02] spacecowboyr: cause the extended duration traps they feel better, plus the resist makes it so they never resist
[1:22:13] makkoftw: mm with that gun for sure
[1:22:14] TORTELLUCI: try
[1:22:15] Pontanzor: do it
[1:22:27] MrChrisJoe: mm + lone w
[1:22:28] TheBeastIncarnateF5Reigns: if you have gold why not
[1:22:30] 0bbie: we like guns KKona
[1:22:33] TheBeastIncarnateF5Reigns: i think its a mistake tho
[1:22:37] Diculas: @Ziqoftw I think truly you get expose weakness and when it procs fish for an Aimed Shot crit, you'll probably see 1500 damage
[1:22:43] hobbehesu: might need to buy new ranks, dunno if you played MM at all
[1:22:45] MrChrisJoe: go full mm
[1:22:45] niku_baku: KKool GuitarTime
[1:22:50] Majcurko: KKona GuitarTime
[1:23:25] arcane_p: Can Someone Tell me How to Get that Nogg's Brilliant Gold Ring with 16 stamina on it?
[1:23:34] shykuar: tap people in bg and stv
[1:23:45] asfjordy: melee specialist still ofc
[1:24:07] Loganlols: you should check out the addon 'RuneBar'. makes runeswapping super quick and easy, dont need to open character panel
[1:24:15] mike_aqu: @Ziqoftw will be spamming viper on u per usual my guy
[1:24:19] Ser_Khan: Globaling in 1 raptor is kinda goated tho
[1:24:55] relaxcalmdown: to trade to stars when u were doing runes mebbe? :P
[1:25:00] TheBeastIncarnateF5Reigns: for Stars probably
[1:25:14] Diculas: @Ziqoftw For leg runes there arent good options really, you can get serpent spread from rep vendor for some added BG damage but really nothing good. Chest rune lion is good because of stam increase but lone wolf will make you oneshot people with aimed shot crits

[2:26:47] spacecowboyr: cause its 30% for both weapon strikes
[2:26:53] snekkn1: they're removing that 30% tho
[2:27:17] Diculas: @Ziqoftw with a 2h you need a slow weapon for higher crits. dual wield also gives an extra 30% damage, right now i can crit for 1000 regularly with warsong sword main hand and vanq sword offhand. they're gonna remove the 30 damage buff tho
[2:27:27] thetoughbreak: @ziqoftw 3v3 arena should have an account wide rating, no more character rating. This would inject mmr and would make it so that we aren't fighting all glads and rank 1s at low rating. 7/10 2k rated games are against these players it's ridiculous. It makes it very difficult to gain rating when these players are making 10 toons because it's so easy gear. Also this would make it so that u can't just reroll the flavor of the month op specs and take advantage of inbalance
