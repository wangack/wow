[4:00:32] Nightbot: Dalvsali and Pilla are Dali's newest alts on Classic Era. The plan is to ultimately use the warrior as a GDKP alt. The Paladin solely exists to healbot the warrior, no plans to raid on it.

[4:02:11] bacconader: Its gotten better now, prcies went down like 20% over the last couple weeks
