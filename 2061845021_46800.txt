[13:01:42] z_e_p_h_i_r: he's starting to believe
[13:01:56] RagingSantas: where's the timer?
[13:02:31] z_e_p_h_i_r: the world clock is the timer. he's tracking it and knows when the jobs cycle
[13:02:39] RagingSantas: @z_e_p_h_i_r aaah ok thanks
[13:03:02] DEagleEye: @ragingsantas in his brain, it changes every 5mins but the start of that 5m is random so u gotta figure that bit out
[13:03:48] z_e_p_h_i_r: starting to see why marlo was lowkey the richest man in 3.0
[13:04:20] sezmarv: Is this the same Marlo Fifi previous Ex Husband??
[13:04:27] DEagleEye: ya
[13:04:29] Ludens9: @sezmarv Yep

[13:12:01] DEagleEye: but theres been alot of scuff
[13:12:18] obscurewill: Yeah, fair
[13:12:55] nichtwissen00: i see this job for the first time, do they only pick up the packages, not deliver?
[13:13:14] DEagleEye: @nichtwissen00 they pick up and then drop off at hq
[13:13:40] nichtwissen00: thx
[13:16:28] misfit_justice: this is a surprisingly comfy duo
[13:20:12] Lyndonia: I always liked Marlow

[13:21:57] KimParktsingLee: dont you lose sani rep by doing grime?
[13:22:23] mechabananas: sani out grime in
[13:22:48] DEagleEye: @kimparktsinglee ya but he loses sewer rep by doing sani
[13:23:11] KimParktsingLee: @DEagleEye what does sewer rep do?
[13:23:45] DEagleEye: buy the distilleries and find more rotten fruit for moonshine @kimparktsinglee
[13:23:56] KimParktsingLee: ah okay thanks
[13:24:00] DEagleEye: also immune to sewer damage
[13:24:00] obscurewill: @KimParktsingLee some shop purchases and sewer air resistence/immunity
[13:25:04] TropicalToucan: Did every job and he chose to live in sewers and eat rats KEKW
[13:25:11] reichenbachs: towing is pain
[13:25:39] TropicalToucan: well now Marlo you have to do 100,000 moonshine combinations

[13:26:51] Zechss_: thats just like put on some tunes, and crack on no pressure
[13:28:03] TropicalToucan: 20 a RUN? That sound insane stars. 3 stars still really good LUL
[13:28:41] DEagleEye: @tropicaltoucan well u gotta think it basically per hour cause jobs take 45mins to 90mins depending on contracts
[13:28:47] Miffmac: 20 stars a run wasn't the case either at the beginning, it was only for a week or 2
[13:28:56] mokoto05: tony octo and cousin have a packer EZ passenger
[13:29:06] TropicalToucan: @DEagleEye compared to sani you can get 0.01 some zones
[13:29:06] DEagleEye: 3 rep per run is basically 100 hours to hit 300 rep
[13:29:17] TropicalToucan: Thats still not a lot
[13:29:18] fattyhomer: you know everyone is down bad when even Marlo is down bad
[13:29:37] misfit_justice: yea Octo told Harry that he needed like 60 hrs worth of boxvilles before he got his packer, then rep gain got incredibly juiced.
[13:29:44] misfit_justice: pounder*
[13:29:57] DEagleEye: @tropicaltoucan yea its still better than sani but also, you can lose your access to trucks if you get scuffed or robbed and lose a run so it kinda needs to be higher than sani
[13:30:07] eliteviewer77: Marty also abandoned his first Job. Switched from g6 to sanitation
[13:31:11] DEagleEye: @misfit_justice it was worse than that, tony got his rep to pounder, got rep and money taken away twice LUL
[13:31:12] TropicalToucan: LUL I didnt know there were Grime personal stats LUL
[13:31:16] Firepokachu: i wanna see octo and tonys grime stats
[13:31:17] RagingSantas: oh that's a cool metric
[13:31:34] daemonicknight: yuno
[13:31:45] misfit_justice: Octo's grime stats are probably pretty nutty
[13:31:52] eliteviewer77: 50 hours of grime in a video game and still being broke is nuts

[13:38:25] DEagleEye: grimes chill but scuff ruining runs hurt alot cause of the time invested per run

[13:44:37] mechabananas: Marlo standing on business

[13:47:59] Ludens9: how do you like your first grime run?
[13:48:07] DEagleEye: yea there was alooot of scuff but if it works its chill af
[13:48:12] emlismeh: imagine the packer witha 4-5k payout
[13:48:15] RagingSantas: yeah you don't need to go balls to the wall for that job

[13:48:34] mokoto05: ^
[13:48:40] Zeratanis: big thing (and a big source of frustration for tony) is spending most the time, then oops, run scuffs and that hour is just...gone lol
[13:48:42] RagingSantas: you'd need to do what 2 hours of sani for comparable money?
[13:48:47] zer0cool1138: it's definitely low effort

[13:50:26] RagingSantas: gotta be something, cna't be nothing
[13:50:27] Gureet0: would make sens
[13:50:27] DatHarryGuy: it cant be nothing
[13:50:29] megamanyvr: can’t be nothing
[13:50:30] reagon_plays: so thats 120 combinations
[13:50:31] Bealzybub: can't be nothing
[13:50:35] Azure_96: HYPERPOGGER
[13:50:37] Hyperion57: Pog
[13:50:41] GreasySlothKing: something to work off at least
[13:50:55] zer0cool1138: yep just eliminated 50,000 combinations
[13:51:21] jfletcher68: maybe time plays a factor
[13:51:34] zer0cool1138: below average must mean one of each. And average means 2 of his ql
[13:51:39] DEagleEye: @zer0cool1138 nah i dont think so at all
[13:51:46] rollindarock: Its user based defo, but could be location on the pot also, no backseat, just summizing
[13:51:57] reagon_plays: method might be same
[13:52:16] RagingSantas: it could be 5^10 which is 9765625 different combinations
[13:52:22] reagon_plays: so 5 below average combinations would be 5^10
[13:52:37] reagon_plays: @RagingSantas no 5^5
[13:53:12] RagingSantas: @reagon_plays not if marlo got average from the same accross
[13:53:40] zer0cool1138: No cause you can't have 2 below averages if three are right
[13:54:16] eliteviewer77: Hmm different per still is interesting
[13:54:29] Hyperion57: oh no KEKW
[13:54:35] zer0cool1138: oh yeah that's a killer
[13:54:38] mojo6464: cant be unless you have multiple correct answers
[13:54:46] Azure_96: Then everything would be insane
[13:54:49] Slice0fBread: The variability would be too exponential
[13:54:51] nutzzhunter: What if a bad element increases a good element
[13:55:00] zer0cool1138: also means you have to start over if someone breaks your still
[13:55:31] qvbxx: and so do i\
[13:55:35] megamanyvr: average would be middle
[13:55:53] DEagleEye: @zer0cool1138 that was the case with meth tables in 3.0 (and ooc the answer to that has been figured out but harry dsnt know it ic so i wont say)
[13:55:59] eliteviewer77: Has he tried / me knows the answer?
[13:56:54] zer0cool1138: gotcha I've only seen Harry working on it so far.
[13:57:36] eliteviewer77: No idea
[13:57:42] twitchisbaaad: 5^5 combos to try
[13:57:45] zuckscalulator: Ur crazy
[13:57:52] mojo6464: ur crazy
[13:57:53] Azure_96: it seems pretty solid given how much isn't known yet
[13:58:06] eliteviewer77: Depends on what the devs wanted it to be. Idk if logic can apply
[13:58:11] JaeMendo: would there be an excellent or something better than good?
[13:58:12] DEagleEye: its a solid theory but theres sooo many other options that fit as well ao who knows
[13:58:23] eddieb0822: scientifically sound theory
[13:58:24] megamanyvr: I would assume average is middle, so 3/5
[13:58:25] zer0cool1138: but you shouldn't get multiple below averages
[13:58:38] Azure_96: yeah
[13:58:49] zer0cool1138: based on results I'd assume below average means one is correct
[13:58:50] PkTwo187: i dont see that happening because 5 of them are below average, so you cant use 3 of the same of 5 elements it would be 15 slots to make a good?
[13:58:50] qvbxx: or if its on a sliding scale?
[13:58:51] DEagleEye: yea still eliminating combinations
[13:58:58] Azure_96: Failure is progress
[13:58:59] CuttyNA: do all the distillerys share the same recipe with one user?
[13:59:19] DEagleEye: @cuttyna he dsnt know ic ao i wont say
[13:59:24] DEagleEye: so*
[13:59:37] modyobwoc: I thought someone got better than good when snr buns food could be put in by mistake
[13:59:49] zer0cool1138: I'd definitely recommend doing one from each of the below average elements first thing
[14:00:13] twitchisbaaad: I feel like below avg is having 1 slot right out of 5 for the best possible shine
[14:00:13] qvbxx: what if its like the EQ adjustments on audio mixing
[14:00:15] DEagleEye: he wasnt asking sharing recipes with people he was asking if your seed is shared across distillerys or if each distilery changes your seed @harry
[14:00:24] Lyndonia: @Harry If you ever get bored of being a streamer, you can come work for my QA team bug testing our software, the way you process problems would be perfectly suited lol
[14:00:40] PkTwo187: we try everything until theres no more options.. grind time
[14:01:13] DEagleEye: ye im just not gonna say YEP
[14:01:17] zer0cool1138: I agree having to start over would destroy some people lol
[14:01:27] quote_me_if_horsen: was 5 coarse and 5 below average?
[14:01:44] PkTwo187: @quote_me_if_horsen yes
[14:01:46] zer0cool1138: @quote_me_if_horsen  Yes
[14:02:27] mojo6464: is it known how many grades of shine there is
[14:02:31] zer0cool1138: I had expected 5 harsh and 5 coarse when I suggested it hours ago
[14:02:58] DEagleEye: @mojo6464 we only knownof harsh course and below avg so safe to assume there's 6 or 7 total
[14:03:01] Lyndonia: you should start a google doc to track it
[14:03:04] quote_me_if_horsen: but what if the 5 coarse is the right  combo  to throw people off
[14:03:22] wilson060: still raises the question why Marlo got an average
[14:03:24] rollindarock: I think a course element might be needed in rhe holy grail batch tbh
[14:03:25] rayantrex: 🐀
[14:03:35] zer0cool1138: I'm dying to see you try one of each of the below averages
[14:03:55] rollindarock: Coarse*
[14:04:08] Aitchemdee: time to binge watch moonshiners
[14:04:45] hypnomaze: he bought something for 10k yesterday too
[14:04:58] Meta616: i didn't see the living in the sewers thing coming at all. so  funny]
[14:05:00] Slice0fBread: His replication hypothesis is interesting.  Has differences in location of the distilleries have been tried/ or mattered
[14:05:05] zer0cool1138: 22grand on extended mags
[14:05:15] DEagleEye: @hypnomaze new pc setup for 18k yesterday and 22k on mags today

[14:11:34] iniblu: Periodic table of distilling elements?
[14:11:54] Aitchemdee: have you tried adding magnets
[14:11:59] mojo6464: what if below average means you have one element in the right spot
[14:12:07] Tripledot321: I think it is like a 5 letter password. A correct letter/element and position is 1 point, which increase the grade by 1. Either correct letter or position is 0.5 point. Each distillery has its own combination.
[14:12:19] zer0cool1138: that actually makes sense if one of the 2 good elements was in the correct order
[14:12:30] mattmajor30: if water is hard to get… maybe less water ?
[14:13:14] iniblu: Wordle
[14:13:21] zer0cool1138: unless order means alot
[14:13:30] zuckscalulator: No cuz people can't have the same combination cuz its tied to the persom
[14:13:44] megamanyvr: I think order matters 100%
[14:13:54] zuckscalulator: Random 100%
[14:14:54] IrSleepii: gurgle KEKW
[14:15:11] eliteviewer77: tbh this conversation might be useless, what if there are many answers and it depends on the person
[14:15:12] zer0cool1138: I would take one of the random below averages put the good elements in the same order as in the BA and fill in with the rest of the good elements
[14:15:24] eliteviewer77: his answer could be different then yours
[14:15:45] DEagleEye: @eliteviewer77 they know that already, each person has a unqiue "seed"
[14:15:59] mojo6464: no
[14:16:22] EndReigns: 5!
[14:16:30] nutzzhunter: 15.625 combinations
[14:16:38] zer0cool1138: base the orders on where they are in you random below averages. You have a 50% chance of it being in the right slot
[14:16:46] eliteviewer77: @DEagleEye i mean different methods not different elements. them sharing experiements of ways probably isnt the best idea, harry should do it himself
[14:17:00] RK0911: Does harry not take damage from sewers anymore?
[14:17:20] DEagleEye: @eliteviewer77 nah theres no way each person has there own method/ruleset
[14:17:36] eliteviewer77: @DEagleEye they could group it easily
[14:17:39] quote_me_if_horsen: if he does one of the 5 coarse and he gets something better then all its for nothing LUL
[14:17:40] Slice0fBread: No, his head even turned into a rat because of the mutation
[14:17:41] 19Timmy98: @DEagleEye why not? was the same for meth in 3.0
[14:17:48] zer0cool1138: @DEagleEye No he's at like 160+ stars
[14:18:01] scarthy: hopefully somehow you're able find a recipe in the trash KEKW
[14:18:02] eliteviewer77: multiple people have the same method but there are several methods
[14:18:05] AmyanaKC: 5⁵=125 (5 to the power of 5)
[14:18:14] rollindarock: It has to be user based if Mario hits average on Harry's below aver surely
[14:18:30] DEagleEye: @19timmy98 meth everybody had a different answer, not a different ruleset
[14:19:11] cola_kela: @amyanakc u sure about that LUL
[14:19:11] quote_me_if_horsen: but if all 5 experiments are below average then its also good
[14:19:16] TeaNMuffins: sets down muffin tray of french vanilla marionberry muffins
[14:19:20] TeaNMuffins: Enjoy @chat @harry
[14:19:51] TeaNMuffins: <3
[14:19:58] boobysmoke: <3
[14:20:01] zer0cool1138: yes. You could look at your random below averages to replicate placements of the good elements too
[14:20:22] CuttyNA: itd probably be faster to just do something like 5,5,5,5,5. 5,5,5,5,1. 5,5,5,1,1. And so on until the quality drops, then you'd find out which spot the element goes into ? Then you can eliminate a spot to work with so you only need to find the 4 remaining elements
[14:20:38] DEagleEye: @eliteviewer77 ye it just dsnt make sense for each person to have a unqiue set of rules for the same mechanic, it would be 1 set of rules but each person has a different problem within those rules to solve
[14:20:49] AmyanaKC: No lol, I'm tired... let's try 5 factorial = 120
[14:20:55] DEagleEye: but yea they cld do anything in theory
[14:21:12] rollindarock: The real spanner on this is if location of distiller makes a difference, but save that headache for later ha
[14:21:40] CheffBoiRZ: this is like sanitation level 2
[14:21:44] Slice0fBread: Different set of rules  for everyone would make no sense.
[14:22:04] zer0cool1138: @CuttyNA he's more on a 12345, 12354, 13524, stage
[14:22:11] Aitchemdee: it’s pretty simple put the distillery in the shower in room 503 and then add magnets it can’t be nothing it’s gotta be something @harry if all else fails ask the whales
[14:22:19] TeaNMuffins: I took a little 5 day vacay and missed a lot it seems like! Did the USB's ever get figured out?
[14:22:23] qvbxx: can you only deliver your own crates chat?
[14:22:57] zer0cool1138: no si delivered some for Harry
[14:22:58] eliteviewer77: @Slice0fBread it could, an example would be 3 rulesets and what set of rules someone gets is random
[14:23:10] DEagleEye: @qubeox naaah tony was delivering gigis and si was delivering harrys
[14:23:12] rollindarock: Its one of the best things the devs have ever done in a mechanic if its user based. Its sick that it needs hard graft to find and no meta possible
[14:23:53] eliteviewer77: meth operated the same way, this might be a larger scale though hopefully
[14:24:14] Peeeelz: Haha deliver it with the drone app from the pc
[14:24:37] Azure_96: niice
[14:24:41] zer0cool1138: I'm surprised the toilets aren't for making prison wine.

[14:24:49] Rool_Gonzalez: Downhill or cross-country?
[14:24:52] rollindarock: @eliteviewer77 Meth was pretty easy to perfect if remember correctly
[14:24:55] zer0cool1138: have fun!

[14:26:23] modyobwoc: are there an even number of smallBIG and BIGsmall letter combos? Some have small first some big first...
[14:26:23] jfletcher68: might be good to try it forwards and backwards to see if it changes things
[14:26:26] SolidN: geegaNODDERS
[14:26:39] zer0cool1138: yeah I'm super excited
[14:26:52] AnomanderRake__: I had a nice 5 hours sleep and harry is still streamng. What a monster
[14:27:19] zer0cool1138: it's all down to the correct order I assume
[14:27:22] wilson060: have you figured out if cook time means anything?
[14:27:27] eddieb0822: shoot I didn’t get to see. what was the combo?
[14:28:00] Ludens9: Prayge hopefully
[14:28:04] jfletcher68: could be position based like getting all yellow on wordle lol
[14:28:04] quote_me_if_horsen: and also sell it to see if cash is different if it does not go below average
[14:29:05] zer0cool1138: if you plot the good  element slots of your random below averages you can hopefully see a pattern for correct slot placement
[14:29:13] theQpocket: aaarrghh the sunlight
[14:29:16] iniblu: Can you leave out fruit?
[14:30:01] DEagleEye: @jfletcher68 forwards and backwards dsnt really work casue the middle choice stays the same and that might be what caused the avg result, better to offset all leters 1 to the right or left, or randomise the order completely
[14:30:37] quote_me_if_horsen: if all of these experiments are below average, you might need to sell the bottles to see if cash is diff
[14:30:49] DEagleEye: if that theory of slots is even correct
[14:31:43] ChrisPNutssss: omg degen harry
[14:32:13] zer0cool1138: @DEagleEye Im hopeful just based on my theory of 5 bad and 5 good
[14:32:24] geo_logic_: maybe theres more than one good recipe though
[14:32:43] DEagleEye: @zer0cool1138 so, have you ever seen a show called letters and numbers?
[14:32:54] Rool_Gonzalez: And to think it is Way easier then seeds for food in 3.0 ,that was some DNA level science
[14:32:54] zer0cool1138: no
[14:33:05] Slice0fBread: Rp so hard that you'll be making moonshine irl
[14:33:15] zer0cool1138: I'm mostly basing my theory on the game mastermind
[14:33:27] TeaNMuffins: @Slice0fBread It's already legitimate money laundering, why not KEKW

[14:35:50] DEagleEye: @i_a_p_o he lost 6 from an 90% full grime run
[14:36:06] zer0cool1138: no problem
[14:36:40] DEagleEye: oh god its massive LUL

[14:45:26] mCerti: How is the grimer going?
[14:46:10] lunate87: KEKW i can imagine harry maxing out rep with grime before tony
[14:46:26] HowlDestined: Damn Harry still awake?
[14:46:34] DEagleEye: @lunate87 tonys been max for ages
[14:46:41] simplysavvy793: Tony has had max grim rep for a long time
[14:46:48] lunate87: @DEagleEye oh KEKW
[14:46:56] DEagleEye: and thats with him getting knocked down rep twice
[14:47:03] mokoto05: finding a partner in grime is pretty hard
[14:47:04] DEagleEye: and scuff losing him rep

[14:48:50] mokoto05: oof
[14:49:23] DEagleEye: it wasnt even that the contract gave him 21 and he usually gets 20, the contract TOLD him he would only get 20 as well
[14:49:35] DEagleEye: the contract weights were scuffed they fixed them now
[14:49:45] Firepokachu: for a long time the weight was wrong sometimes
[14:49:55] DEagleEye: and tony didnt know 21 was an option or he wldnt of ran it
[14:50:25] nominaltimes: Im listening to heaven on a sharp stick, Consider my CV in the mail
[14:50:33] simplysavvy793: Tony has had to get his rep back so many times from scuff
[14:51:15] DEagleEye: yea watching tony grind has been fun, tunes, gigi podcast, but also so much despair with the scuff and him flipping the truck LUL
[14:51:39] Firepokachu: man whips the truck and then crashes

[14:54:52] mCerti: WICKED
[14:57:22] mCerti: Is the packer bigger than this??

[14:57:41] DEagleEye: @mcerti oh yea its a detachable trailer

[14:57:51] mCerti: @DEagleEye wtf LUL

[14:58:33] Zeratanis: if grime is anything like fedex, they wont care about broken packages KEKW
[14:58:37] DEagleEye: @mcerti if you go thru the tunnels with the packer you can see where your going unless you look thru your eyes or angle the camera at like a 45 degree angle
[14:58:59] DEagleEye: cant see*
[14:59:15] Zechss_: jesus your still ging
[14:59:18] Zechss_: going even

[15:04:48] Firepokachu: also the packer is manual
[15:04:50] Firepokachu: right?
[15:05:01] zer0cool1138: sequential
[15:05:06] AnomanderRake__: Agreed
[15:05:15] Firepokachu: yeah
[15:05:17] DEagleEye: ye its like 10-12 runs to make back your packer investment but prob more than that cause you repair every 2-3 runs
[15:05:45] Firepokachu: and repairs are getting hella expensive right
[15:06:03] DEagleEye: @firepokachu at mosleys yea, depends who you know
[15:06:38] DEagleEye: like cousin gets cheap repairs from the vagos, tony gets cheap repairs from basically all the repair shops other than mosleys as he has racing connects
[15:06:54] DEagleEye: but materials have gone up

[15:11:02] misfit_justice: the weight of contracts were inaccurate for the longest time, so relying on that could fuck you over

[15:44:19] soleb_xx: are you gonna open this crate?
[15:44:22] zer0cool1138: look at your old random cooks that were below average and see where the good elements were in the recipe

[15:44:35] lunate87: i wonder is the max atm average?
[15:44:43] lunate87: did anyone get better than average?
[15:45:03] jadedwrong: damn, the devs really put in the time in this, there's so much work needed to perfect this
