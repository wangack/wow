[0:35:53] Arkrisen: Mornin @jdotb! Be honest, you were the mastermind behind Ambition's implosion last night to get dream team momentum going weren't you? :)
[0:37:58] Arkrisen: Duuuuuude
[0:38:08] dardrayx: it was so fun
[0:38:21] Kmork1: it was craZy
[0:38:21] shdowtrail: @jdotb Nerf raged, muted and then JPC said he wasn't playing anymore if Nerf was going to act like a baby. Basically team gone
[0:38:22] Guffels: Guffels watched 15 consecutive streams this month and sparked a watch streak! Ok I got the streak. See you tomorrow kek
[0:38:42] Perry_TP: wtf I missed a drama? ðŸ˜­
[0:38:47] eb_farnum: nurf got tilted at ellesmere over healing and stops and stopped talking to the group, which meant that JPC quit the team for good over not liking how nurf was dealing with things
[0:38:50] eb_farnum: basically
[0:38:50] sdw777: ye hopeful's fault Kapp
[0:39:11] dardrayx: well. nerf said he hates playing with ellesmere sometimes. james called nerf an idiot
[0:39:16] dardrayx: 10/10 stream

[0:39:38] Kmork1: Kmork1 watched 3 consecutive streams this month and sparked a watch streak! what is this
[0:39:42] Arkrisen: Elle's vod from last night. Like 5:07. Elle overlapped a sweep with Nerf's stun. Nerf went ballistic. Literally said "Sometimes I really hate playing with this healer, and by sometimes I mean all the time." Then he ;muted, then JPC said welp I'm never playing again if Nerf isn't going to unmote. So they all kind of said whelp, I guess o7 guys.
[0:39:57] MicHawkh: Like what?
[0:40:43] Kmork1: you get to comfortable with each other and shit just comes out. i have friends like that
[0:41:02] Arkrisen: I watch them a lot and they are pretty sharp with each other and have had their blowups but this one was pretty nuts. Of course then everyone jumped into Growl's channel last night (including Hopeful, Elle, Billy, etc.) while Dorki, Growl and everyone else memed about going non-verbal.

[0:46:31] schmidtyz: oh nevermind I was blind
[0:47:15] Arkrisen: It was certainly a WILD night. (And lots of excellent memes came out of it.) Jokes aside I hoope they figure out a way through it and come out of it ok.
[0:47:40] Primable: is there a clip of nerf rage?

[1:00:48] kevinsk8er: i dont think so
[1:00:59] Guffels: Are you playing resto druid because you think it's better than disc or because you are better at it than you would be at disc?
[1:01:21] Arkrisen: Elle said they were talking about it but hadnâ€™t decided anything.
[1:01:31] Aggroboy: @Guffels hes playing all three specs MW Disc Rdru
[1:01:34] Cervantas: i miss shak

[1:04:09] Guffels: I'm just getting to a point where I feel the priest utility isn't making up for it's performance and I think I want to move to something else. Of course I'm only pugging 23's so who knows.

[1:05:00] Kmork1: ST is the realest damage out there amen
[1:06:13] basherbash32: Who is your MDI team?
[1:06:16] crixx123: wudya think of the double fire mage rogue set up
[1:06:28] nggobi: I agree with you in general, but from what it looks like Monkin does really well in high keys. Then it comes in again that you only need "a druid". But that's exactly how we want it, you can play different comps for the absolute highest keys, more fun to watch and more fun to play.
[1:06:43] nggobi: one*
[1:06:51] Kmork1: moonkin also just dies randomly
[1:06:56] Kmork1: and the name of the game is live
[1:07:14] Carmhealz: i enjoy watching people be excellent at the underrated heal specs.
[1:07:22] Aggroboy: Paryge
[1:07:38] Carmhealz: i am a resto shaman main. and i really only play with friends so its not bad
[1:07:50] basherbash32: Outlaw rogue is so good right now.
[1:07:53] Carmhealz: i log into the game to hang out with people not pug really.
[1:08:05] crixx123: ignite build as fire mage kinda screwed my preference on frost mage :(
[1:08:06] Carmhealz: yea i get what you mean
[1:08:34] basherbash32: What does ignite have to do with frost?
[1:08:53] crixx123: it leaves frost with no invite thats my point
[1:09:01] Carmhealz: @crixx123 lol
[1:09:19] Lilistraza: Could make it like FF, set party reqs and instead of inviting people if people que up and meet those specs they're just auto invited.
[1:09:38] basherbash32: Are you pushing keys higher than 28?
[1:09:56] Carmhealz: lol
[1:09:59] Kyocere: theres a few m+ communities out there that people can join. you can find groups and play whatever spec you like. people dont make an effort to socialize and make friends. then complain they cant play the game.
[1:10:01] crixx123: 3450 atm so moving into 28 now

[3:04:07] zephah: yea but you see how jb just said "idk 2" its because when you think of an egg you don't think of the 6 different sizes, quail eggs and dinosaur eggs
[3:04:36] Sokchoy: i think he could fit more than 2 fish eggs in his mouth
[3:06:48] Nico_vdM: Hey JB and chat

[3:20:26] apertured_wizard: i wonder if this boss' VA is the same as the vanilla human female
[3:26:24] apertured_wizard: isnt it such an indictment of how frustrating tyrannical is that this can be timed with almost 5min left on fort

[3:36:17] dithrica: pog
[3:36:19] Akynam_97: could it be player error from mage or is there actually such big difference ?
[3:36:44] grummpz: grummpz subscribed with Prime. 
[3:38:34] FauniB: i mean mage isn't all that good in overall, it just gives strong prio damage and with proper setup can dish out some damage
[3:38:49] Svesno: Button all the way up
[3:38:54] Guffels: I would bring a mage just for mass barrier. As a healer I love that spell. Wish disc shield was that good
[3:39:17] dithrica: yeah EB seems insane for destro but wasnâ€™t sure if it was that good everywhere
[3:40:08] Akynam_97: i miss displacer beast talent so much :(

[3:48:53] Guffels: these baits are terrible kek
[3:51:05] chadworld77: why abandon the key? you just know you can't time it now, i guess?
[3:51:16] Guffels: yeah no way
[3:51:30] Guffels: bosses at this level take too long to recover a wipe in most keys
[3:51:34] Nico_vdM: The alt(s) probably have to craft something
[3:52:50] chadworld77: okay that makes sense
[3:53:05] chadworld77: im new to mythic+, haven't gotten KSM yet, so it's not really how they work at my level

[3:56:49] chadworld77: another dumb question - did you get the currency for upgrades purely from mythic+ dungeons or did you ever do the superblooms for them and stuff?
[3:57:44] FrostmagicED: team pogu
[3:57:57] FrostmagicED: please sir a drop of io
[3:58:34] Guffels: @chadworld77 almost all m+ since week 2. i doubt jb has done a superbloom in the last month

[4:08:36] FrostmagicED: is belor THAT much damage?
[4:08:42] FrostmagicED: i feel like it only does 8-9 mil for me
[4:09:21] FrostmagicED: As a disc priest I feel neutered without my voodoo totem
[4:09:26] Guffels: make sure he takes his dispel. I had a tank yesterday who flamed me in eb for people dying to wasps

[4:21:16] Fraantic: im 488 and i havent set foot in mythic
[4:21:34] caradea_: float one over to my vault
[4:21:45] Guffels: I feel like the dawn loot pools must be rolling the full loot table twice instead of the half loot tables
[4:21:56] dithrica: if only Sadge
[4:22:25] meatshelfpov: i see a lot of guides recommending not to put lifebloom on yourself but i see you doing it quite frequently, when do you put it on yourself or both on other party members/
[4:22:34] Guffels: but I have also had the mastery ring from throne in 3 vaults which isnt a lot but its wild its happened 3 times
[4:23:38] Guffels: @meatshelfpov this has been discussed a few times. top io logs are putting it on 2 dps but jb has been putting 1 on himself since season 1 for the faster ticks and clearcasting procs
[4:23:59] meatshelfpov: was a growl video
[4:24:20] Guffels: my b got it flipped
[4:25:13] Guffels: bro its crazy i tried to do this pull on a 23 yesterday and nobody ccd the cats so 3 people died before the tank ever made it to the bear lol. pugging priest feels so out of your control some times

[4:36:08] Strandson: Hey JB! You're awesome!
[4:36:31] bonjourdaisy: cat weaving shoudl always be a thing
[4:37:31] Strandson: When did cat weaving actually start for resto? Did you do it in legion m+ ?
[4:37:35] Turkeypitz: I'm an oldie and find cat weaving (or druid dps in general) a bit more complicated compared so most other heals - any simple tips?
[4:38:11] Turkeypitz: complicated = hardwork
[4:38:45] dcraftjr: skill ceiling?
[4:38:52] maca134: annoying
[4:38:57] Fraantic: a?
[4:38:58] Nico_vdM: JB for your HotW WA do you want an alert if you someone uses lust and HotW is off cooldown?
[4:39:00] Noobsiqt: Agreed lmao
[4:39:04] Laptican: Has catweaving become easier than it was in Shadowlands?
[4:39:07] Fraantic: i heard my name
[4:39:11] CondorWow: its more involved than lava burst
[4:39:28] keenxp: cant u just starfire spam on big packs
[4:39:45] Laptican: @keenxp That's less effecient imo
[4:39:46] Lalon_93: @keenxp all of tem
[4:39:47] keenxp: sunfire + starfire
[4:40:01] c0jaK: ayije tab dots
[4:40:03] keenxp: @keenxp isnt it just more dmg at a certain mob count
[4:40:28] OcBeefy1: Doesn't disc just spread its dot passively through penance anyway?
[4:40:30] Laptican: @keenxp not if you keep your bleeds up
[4:40:39] flawlesslykun: @jdotb im not one for drama baits or anything, and u probably heard by now but, do u know what happened with nerf/jpc/ellesm yesterday ?
[4:40:42] flawlesslykun: shit made me Sadge
[4:40:54] Laptican: @OcBeefy1 Unfortunately there's a cap on how many it can spread on
[4:41:08] Turkeypitz: it seems fairly engaging for those that like that sorta thing
[4:41:08] OcBeefy1: @Laptican Ah, okay.
[4:41:17] flawlesslykun: ye im only commenting with u because u played with nerf
[4:41:21] flawlesslykun: and idk wtf happened
[4:41:23] bonjourdaisy: those guys are always toxic to eachother
[4:41:28] flawlesslykun: i was playing on my evoker so i didn't catch the whole thing
[4:41:32] palli1994: Anyone got the clip?
[4:41:37] flawlesslykun: but apperantly was because of overlapped stuns
[4:41:42] flawlesslykun: legit wtf man
[4:41:46] Laptican: @OcBeefy1 I think it's like 6 or 7 mobs but yea if you abselutely want it on all mobs then you can tab dot which properly aren't effecient
[4:41:52] Fortearmure: hey jb
[4:42:00] kelly_mac06: yea i like watching elle but it's super hard bc they can sound so toxic towards each other
[4:42:17] CondorWow: they have no context is what you mean
[4:42:25] ultideath: Poor dextus :( he got the eruption of JB toxicity
[4:42:33] c0jaK: elderly
[4:42:41] keenxp: @keenxp idk hotw moonkin form does like 300k+
[4:42:50] Laptican: I once got trashtalked in a +5 because they claimed i couldn't do higher keys, meanwhile i'm doing 26-28's atm KEKW
[4:42:57] kelly_mac06: @ultideath Dextus knows what he did
[4:43:00] CondorWow: in 27 and i play like im 72

[4:44:06] bonjourdaisy: like you have respect
[4:44:20] Laptican: Man i'm trying my very best to avoid talking when my guildies are trashtalking each other KEKW
[4:44:26] flawlesslykun: @WingedChipmunk i typed it in chat allready. I guess nerf got tilted about ellesmere overlapping his leg sweep with chaos nova, muted his mic on a 30 waycrest, and jpc quit the game because of it
[4:44:36] flawlesslykun: which i find very odd because nerf is also a dad now
[4:44:44] kelly_mac06: @flawlesslykun jfc
[4:44:50] exomni: i have 6334 haste and 6k vers, should i reduce some for mastery?
[4:44:56] WingedChipmunk: wild lmao
[4:45:10] whiskeyhide: i could see that lol
[4:45:17] Turkeypitz: people generally hit down only if they feel they can
[4:45:33] Laptican: @flawlesslykun Oh wait that was legit? I thought it was just some false drama
[4:45:41] theVattu: @flawlesslykun when did this happen? :O
[4:45:42] caradea_: @flawlesslykun being a dad does not make you chill
[4:45:44] flawlesslykun: ye i was perplexed aswell
[4:45:47] flawlesslykun: yesterday evening
[4:45:49] dcraftjr: nerf just built for drama
[4:45:54] Laptican: Damn that's wild
[4:46:14] c0jaK: that's all that happened?
[4:46:29] flawlesslykun: i will say tho, ppl on twitch chat can be even worse... they were legit insulting nerf on stream because of a muted mic
[4:46:35] flawlesslykun: the most toxic shit
[4:46:39] flawlesslykun: that's not cool either
[4:47:06] Laptican: And this is probably why i won't be doing any high ish keys with god players ever. I can't handle people bitchin over something to useless
[4:47:55] rjhenator: let's be real; nerf is one of the most toxic streamers out there right now. Nothing is ever his fault, always others.
[4:48:01] WingedChipmunk: @Laptican i wouldnt even say that, it's just finding people that arent going to get angry. Yes people have off days but i've done keys with friends and we fuck around when we know the key is going to shit instead of getting mad at each other lmao
[4:48:18] caradea_: @Laptican in my experience a lot of god players are not like that, bc they know you're not on their level and thats fine for them. really a personality issue
[4:48:39] Blu_ClosetGamer: I also dont like Aug on that key. Time can be tight
[4:48:48] flawlesslykun: @rjhenator see that's the kind of shit that is just not true.... nerf is one of the most fun and skilled tanks out there in this game. Because of this ppl are shitting on him and with good reason i guess, but it still does not make that statement true
[4:48:51] whiskeyhide: i think theres a lot of jpc fans taking this hard too

[4:49:19] Fraantic: and on first boss
[4:49:28] Fraantic: and has bunch of defensives for oakheart

[4:50:02] keyda16: Hello all :)
[4:50:28] Laptican: @WingedChipmunk Yea 100%, last time i played with a good player was Zmok and i gotta say he's the nicest player i have ever played with. He took dying over stupid stuff or using cc wrong so good compared to others i've played with

[4:52:50] Laptican: @WingedChipmunk Yea exactly, that's why i don't get people getting toxic over something like that. I bet the top players have even depleted 29-30's to learn from their mistakes and get to where they are now
[4:53:14] weeshrimp: i'm with you brother, our hairlines were not meant for this world

[6:18:03] JoshuaTree6969: chiefs are mid
[6:18:18] cucumbertoessniffa: curious if you have a solution to the problem.. i have Dream of Cenarius as a guardian druid and it lets me cast regrowth in any form. is there a good way to only let me use the spell IF i have the buff? i.e. i dont want to accidentally regrowth when i dont have the buff because it takes me out of bear form.
[6:18:21] Ozaxx: @banjookie imagine me not timing you out lol
[6:18:25] muzzaie96: ive played sports in mid 20s and that was miserable. i cant imagine negative
[6:18:58] Ozaxx: @banjookie jk ive never done that

[6:19:25] Courion: @househpo There is a macro for that
[6:19:31] fist_10: there is a macro for that
[6:19:41] RoodToob: I think some tanks had a macro for it, maybe dorki in s2?
[6:19:50] muonz: ye check wowhead bear guide macro section it has it
[6:20:15] Courion: console autounshift 0
[6:20:20] pissmane: pissmane subscribed with Prime. 
[6:20:21] muonz: ye its autounshift
[6:20:23] Courion: then the line for cast regrowth
[6:20:24] bearbro9: #showtooltip Regrowth /run SetCVar("autoUnshift",0) /cast [@mouseover,exists,nodead,help][@player] Regrowth /run SetCVar("autoUnshift",1)
[6:20:28] bearbro9: ^ from the guide
[6:20:29] Courion: then console autounshift 1
[6:20:30] Thatsafy: ^
[6:20:36] Thatsafy: that macro is great
[6:20:39] Thatsafy: been using it and loving it
[6:20:49] flawlesslykun: 5Head
[6:21:01] cucumbertoessniffa: oh damn
[6:21:06] cucumbertoessniffa: i need to RTFM - thanks folks
[6:21:12] Ozaxx: i need a timer for how long it takes you to realize dubstep is on lol
[6:21:15] Herkadess: disable the auto unshift, try to cast regrowth, enable the auto unshif
[6:21:24] Herkadess: 5Head indeed
[6:21:24] bazefacee: I got a 29 atal but I know you hate us warriors PepeHands
[6:22:07] cucumbertoessniffa: im glad i asked here because youll surely think of something
[6:22:18] Iqqo: well u have to see the problem with a guardian druid leaving bearform if ur 0.2sec late on the proc
[6:24:23] YdenTV: That macro just keeps you from shifting out of bear form. Wouldn't help not cast if you didn't have clearcasting.
[6:25:59] cucumbertoessniffa: love this song
[6:36:10] Sydshark: what addon/wa are you using to see the classes in que?
[6:36:27] fremen14: any tips on how to avoid drama when you have a dedicated push group?

[6:38:47] fremen14: there is more
[6:38:48] fremen14: ya
[6:38:49] Arkrisen: @jdotb Listen to JPC after the key
[6:38:49] Chazmiklmikl: his healer is annoying man
[6:38:51] Lifebregin: The rest of it comes after the dungeon
[6:38:51] kelly_mac06: he refused to speak at al
[6:38:54] Ghost5392: Lmao I love that shit
[6:38:57] kelly_mac06: yea go to the end
[6:38:59] Ozaxx: you would know better than us lol
[6:39:05] mesa90: this talents jdtob its good bro for m+
[6:39:05] TBouse: there isnt more of nerf, he doesnt speak ever again that stream
[6:39:06] fremen14: https://www.twitch.tv/videos/2030526340?t=19528s
[6:39:10] kelly_mac06: JPC kept trying to get him to talk so they could do another key
[6:39:13] RoodToob: it does, but he did stay muted the whole key from there
[6:39:15] kelly_mac06: he refused to speak at all
[6:39:34] kelly_mac06: it was really shitty
[6:39:35] FuruF: LUL
[6:40:05] kelly_mac06: LOL now that would have been fun to watch
[6:40:06] TBouse: james was in diapers in legion
[6:40:07] Minigamer911: LUL
[6:40:17] kelly_mac06: little baby james doing keys with JB
[6:40:18] fremen14: both of them overreacted tbf
[6:40:51] Ghost5392: I love stuff like this
[6:41:12] kelly_mac06: it's a weird fucking hill to die on
[6:41:20] zanis_: Imagine this being shit people are mad over... they timed the key on a 30 didn't they?
[6:41:22] Arkrisen: @jdotb There's more
[6:41:29] kelly_mac06: @zanis_ YUP
[6:41:38] kelly_mac06: and they got a 31 EB which they really wanted
[6:41:41] kelly_mac06: it was very weird
[6:41:46] zanis_: smh lol @kelly_mac06
[6:41:49] Dimoxia: james going ham  from where you stopped it
[6:41:54] Minigamer911: I seem to remember PVC saying something about being done forever
[6:41:54] kelly_mac06: @zanis_ RIGHT
[6:42:08] Lifebregin: Nerf even actually ran to the EB but refused to talk to them at all until JPC alt f4ed and said bye forever
[6:42:11] RoodToob: I dont really watch them too often, but they only thing I come up with is ellesmere stuns first too often when nerf is supposed to? but idk why that makes you mute
[6:42:13] kelly_mac06: @Minigamer911 he did. he also said thanks and it was fun to play with them and insta logged
[6:42:34] Arkrisen: @jdotb Keep going
[6:42:50] jason_shade: is that an addon or weakaura that shows group comp in finder
[6:42:51] kelly_mac06: JPC tried to get Nerf to talk again at the end of the key
[6:42:53] Arkrisen: JPC goes a little off and basically says he's not playing with them anymore
[6:42:56] kelly_mac06: and he won't
[6:43:00] amzen: He proc cheat death before because ellesmere was "tiger palming"
[6:43:18] fremen14: youre NA's last hope now jb
[6:44:20] fremen14: the question is, how does echo avoid these problems? by not losing? XD
[6:44:20] cucumbertoessniffa: lol
[6:44:48] Ghost5392: @muaddib10191 they don't avoid them LUL
[6:45:03] fremen14: ya but they have meeres to calm everybody down xd
[6:45:08] toastbam: yoda can get pretty spicy
[6:45:11] m_dep: Yoda seems to get dissatisfied with people somewhat easily
[6:45:11] Minigamer911: Nobody has ever died in an Ashen Hallow
[6:45:21] Ozaxx: i think thats the weird part of doing something competitive in an online game not all together
[6:45:25] Dimoxia: echo is  a mean machine when it comes to MDI i reckon even on a bad they they are giga good :p
[6:45:46] Ozaxx: like the fights happen with competitive shit but in other sports youre there with your teammate and you can figure it out there
[6:45:59] Ghost5392: @muaddib10191 There is constant flaming going on when they play. They just get over it and move on.
[6:46:04] m_dep: also same people for years and years
[6:46:08] m_dep: you learn how to work together
[6:46:10] Scoops__: every good team will have disputes they just dont end in people shutting down and not talking lol
[6:46:18] Arkrisen: Zaelia talks about butting heads with Gingi in his birthday video. Haha
[6:46:22] fremen14: @Ozaxx doesnt help that most wow players are kinda socially awkward xd
[6:46:34] toastbam: yeah and they have played together forever
[6:46:38] Ozaxx: @ìž¬ì¹˜ìžˆëŠ” true
[6:47:10] kuntoilija: are you the only healer in the lfg still?
[6:47:37] m_dep: and go nonverbal xdd
[6:47:47] Dimoxia: i remember jb winning ovver them when method NA vs method EU which was insane finals, the rest is history when it comes to them winning
[6:47:53] Highscoore00: Whats this addon for grp finder
[6:48:15] stryfethewolf: @Highscoore00 Try out Premade Group Finder Shows spec and class.
[6:48:21] Arkrisen: Can't take it personally
[6:48:31] Arkrisen: Yep
[6:48:32] fremen14: yeah but not all people can do that so easily
[6:48:57] Highscoore00: @stryfethewolf ty boss
[6:49:42] Arkrisen: Back to Runescape
[6:49:45] Arkrisen: :)
[6:49:46] flawlesslykun: that's what he said y
[6:49:48] flawlesslykun: Sadge
[6:49:57] kelly_mac06: hes gonna play for liquid but yea he's done, back to OSRS
[6:50:11] zerahaha: i feel like theres gotta be some behind the scenes stuffs for everyone to blow up seemingly out of nowhere
[6:50:19] flawlesslykun: i think he means it tho, cause he gave nerf a chance to unmute and talk about it
[6:50:27] kelly_mac06: @flawlesslykun agreed
[6:50:33] kelly_mac06: he was really trying
[6:50:34] Ghost5392: @ìž¬ì¹˜ìžˆëŠ” Honestly, that's the hardest part of finding a 'good' puish group. There are plenty of 'skilled' players but finding people that can all communicate well and put up with all their shit is MUCH harder.
[6:51:03] kelly_mac06: LOL that's the disc priest in my key group. He quits wow every week
[6:52:38] toastbam: yeah, you get some slight insight watching moad, but they are kinda just vibing
[6:52:41] nite101: !mdi
[6:53:15] Geysi82: i legit thought you said he had some shish kebab
[6:53:22] cucumbertoessniffa: back in bfa i saw nerf have a bit of a meltdown on stream and then go do a +2 key while raging. it sucks these folks dont have the awareness to turn stream off and cool down.
[6:53:29] tweed_13: maybe got replaced
[6:53:52] flawlesslykun: ppl since yesterday say that nerf is toxic af towards ellesm, but honestly they raid together, they are friends (i think) and i take the "flame" as a way to push themselves to be better, but yesterday i guess nerf got tilted because they were having a lot of 30's depleted to dumb shit
[6:53:56] fremen14: mdi gonna be stacked this year
[6:54:00] toastbam: that would be a bold move cotton
[6:54:04] flawlesslykun: one of them being ellesm not being able to see circles on floor on everbloom
[6:54:09] fremen14: on paper you have so many good teams
[6:54:17] kelly_mac06: @flawlesslykun hahah i was watching that
[6:54:25] kelly_mac06: he was 100% standing in shit
[6:54:29] flawlesslykun: @kelly_mac06 that that shit is unreal... this fucking game man
[6:54:38] flawlesslykun: they don't fix these issues
[6:54:42] flawlesslykun: invisible mecanics
[6:54:45] flawlesslykun: it's insane
[6:54:48] flawlesslykun: same happens in dht
[6:55:05] kelly_mac06: @flawlesslykun it's weird bc i love watching ellesmere bc i know that he's going to always try to do crazy high keys and weird shit but their comms can be cringe af
[6:55:14] flawlesslykun: YEP
[6:55:23] kelly_mac06: like actually hard to listen to the shit they say to each other
[6:55:36] kelly_mac06: maybe im just a big baby
[6:55:48] kelly_mac06: when i talk shit, im muted so only my cats hear it lol
[6:56:01] eb_farnum: @kelly_mac06 or maybe a decent person
[6:56:10] kelly_mac06: @eb_farnum  <3
[6:56:16] zanis_: @kelly_mac06 their coms are super hard to listen to.  Prevents me from watching them.
[6:56:17] Ashiytv: sounds cringe
[6:56:24] m_dep: conversation should start with the person that made the mistake talking about how to fix things vs. others blaming
[6:56:26] m_dep: you need both sides
[6:56:31] kelly_mac06: @zanis_ yup! i watch with it muted
[6:56:38] zanis_: 100%
[6:56:46] Herkadess: what do you think about the uneven spacing between benches around the valdrakken's fountain
[6:57:00] IsaureTV: i enjoy dungeons, so i pug keys, i think i would hate life if that was like, becoming too much of a serious thing
[6:57:06] IsaureTV: i always vibe even if i deplete
[6:57:13] toastbam: I think there are times when you can address something obvious that messed up. But like, if you dont see that every key, then yeah just go next
[6:57:25] toastbam: Shit just happens sometimes
[6:57:38] flawlesslykun: YEP ó €€
[6:57:41] Highscoore00: Chat ?! Did i miss something there ?!
[6:57:55] Ozaxx: whenever that happens when I pug its like 99% someone is leaving
[6:58:07] zerahaha: ill stick to my pug 25s lol
[6:58:13] m_dep: I hate that so much, even see it in my low noob keys. plenty of time left, then just toxic for no reason => people leave
[6:58:33] flawlesslykun: i'm hardstuck below 3.2k score. u don't believe the shit i see in pugs @jdotb
[6:58:38] flawlesslykun: i mean u pug everyday so u prob do
[6:58:41] kelly_mac06: @m_dep yea for real, it's why i just yell into the void instead of at ppl. just let's finish the damn key first lol
[6:59:57] m_dep: @kelly_mac06 I should just make macro for "everyone chill the timer is easy lets get this done"
[7:00:07] kelly_mac06: LOL yesssss @m_dep
[7:00:08] Highscoore00: @jdotb After keying people call each other names and then reporting each other like pussies !
[7:00:11] flawlesslykun: that mentality is there since the launch of every new patch tho tbh jb. It is actualy insane how anal ppl are to get into normal raid even today
[7:00:15] Highscoore00: at least its always like this in US
[7:00:53] flawlesslykun: @Highscoore00 trust me it's worse in EU dude
[7:01:05] flawlesslykun: like jb is saying, every1 has main char syndrom
[7:01:09] Hyvest: I open my mic to say "I'm bad" YEP
[7:01:26] kelly_mac06: @Hyvest hahah same
[7:01:36] maenkins: @Hyvest LUL me too
[7:01:57] Scoops__: @Hyvest in general this is the reason why im dead
[7:02:01] toastbam: thats what i used to say to my ex
[7:02:07] toastbam: didnt work out well obviously
[7:02:46] zerahaha: thats why youre the champ
[7:03:45] Highscoore00: @flawlesslykun meh idk maybe
[7:03:48] m_dep: plus its fun to make the "hero play" and save the key if somebody else fucks up
[7:03:55] Minigamer911: Yeah, I could have lobbed them  before the key started
[7:04:27] flawlesslykun: @Highscoore00 if u don't believe me, and trust me i love echo aswell, just look at how many toxic "fanbois" are hopping between chats during the rwf
[7:04:35] flawlesslykun: EU > US in toxicity 100%
[7:05:31] m_dep: @flawlesslykun but US has OCE KEKW
[7:05:44] flawlesslykun: OI MATE KEKW FACK OFF KEKW
[7:05:58] kuntoilija: oy guvnor
[7:07:10] flawlesslykun: @jdotb can we take a moment to apreciate how fucking awesome rageheart trinket is btw ?

[7:08:54] Highscoore00: @flawlesslykun Funny fact im from US and i watch Race here and there and tune up at Max stream and i typed like (To boys echo is winning or whatever) and they instantly ban me from Maximum twitch channel :D
[7:08:58] Scoops__: i think at best you keep everyone except yoda. just do a clean break. but jpc sounded out out.
[7:08:59] DrDucleus: rageheart dropped last night but I forgot to change loot spec and a 19 roll won it BabyRage

[7:09:13] lizardo221: We often joke in our guild that we could have a tax question or something, and the best place to go to for an answer is the druid discord.
[7:09:18] IsaureTV: ye those 2 28 are clearly doable
[7:09:20] Herkadess: @IsaureTV way too many "i"s i'm sorry i take it back

[7:11:21] Ozaxx: helll no
[7:11:24] IsaureTV: tho earlier today i tagged into a 29wm with a 3400-3500 group, and we timed it
[7:11:30] IsaureTV: so, pog i guess
[7:11:50] menzlo: He gets all the haters
[7:12:02] StoneFaceWoW: Max is the opposite of asmon, imagine he wants a super clean and safe space for chat.  good for him

[7:22:24] Ciqq: Hey Jb, how do you handle the chronoburst around manifested timeways in Fall? Seems like people just fall over on anything 25 and over?
[7:22:26] caradea_: i guess the problem for many is that for the most part, the other person remains a voice behind some random transmog. takes empathy to form a strong relationships this way
[7:23:24] yaugerz: and dont forget the intimate playdates

[7:31:26] baseboned: wing street, the pizza hut brand, does wet
[7:31:33] kelly_mac06: ye wingstop lemmon pepper is dry but so good
[7:31:38] Blackgoose25: how much verse do u have with phial and mark
[7:31:47] StoneFaceWoW: gotta be a rapper from ATL to get the lemon pepper WET
[7:32:42] Arccadez: is 48% haste for rdruid too much?

[7:33:25] kelly_mac06: even BWW is dry
[7:34:07] StoneFaceWoW: get extra lemon pepper seasoning on the side, toss with melted butter and prosper

[7:49:08] w0lfh4rt: overlapping of the textures / effects hides them sometimes, makes them hard to see
[7:51:37] Clever_Husky: Do you utilize verdancy at all  or do you prefer the 20% faster healing?
[7:53:51] xuanlive: @Clever_Husky he wants faster hots, for more clearcast procs, for more 4 p
[7:53:59] Silverkoppen: @jdotb do you think we're getting only df dungeons in s4?
[7:55:36] Clever_Husky: @xuanlive makes sense, im using verdancy with tranquil mind because ive found the clearcasting procs are gonna overlap a lot regardless of the speeds, or i've just got insanely good rng hahaha

[7:57:31] kaspagre: JB since you mostly use convoke for healing isnt incarn more reliable?
[7:57:53] burne114: I donâ€™t think he uses it mostly for healing
[7:58:15] burne114: itâ€™s much more versatile, can use more often and for either healing or damage
[7:58:59] kaspagre: It may be versatile but for sure its unreliable
[7:59:07] burne114: yea absolutely
[8:02:57] burne114: itâ€™s slippery

[10:20:20] EwynTV: tbh you probably need prot paladin to help you there as disc
[10:20:58] MangoMafioso: Oh very good to know I probably lose a lot of up time from wanting moonfire up
