[1:37:36] GrishnerF: when the lichking died, wow died
[1:37:45] 5hourandy: hiii
[1:37:46] Dutchlocked: wrath just felt like retail without things to do to me
[1:37:47] Trexbo_: I actually wonder how they would've played out stories like Illidan's or Arthas's if they didn't finish them in WoW, like maybe if they continued the Warcraft series
[1:37:48] Shadoweth_Mango: i got too bored in TOGC phase and quit before icc LMAO
[1:37:51] p5ycc: it was the biggest hype expansions cause of Arthas but i dont think was the best expansion
[1:37:56] Metrii: @Dutchlocked ^
[1:38:06] pSovS: People doing 20 GDKP in Togc phase ICANT
[1:38:09] Asmii: Its just end of an expansion, if they released full fresh wrath it would be popular again, that's why private servers were always popular
[1:38:11] wreckstormx: wrath is far from retail
[1:38:20] Trexbo_: Cata pogg

[1:38:22] Nunadaaa: Clueless
[1:38:23] Shadoweth_Mango: COPIUM
[1:38:26] BabaChaw: I think cataclysm also brought a lot of good lore. But the raids/dungeons were too hard and killed the casual players at the time back then
[1:38:27] CoReRoded: COPIUMi
[1:38:29] CoReRoded: COPIUM
[1:38:37] TakisC00: wrath was is and will always be nostalgia bait and overrated, but thats alright because there is nothing wrong with nostalgia
[1:38:41] krulfar: @wreckstormx true, it has the bad things of retail and the bad things of vanilla, the worst of both worlds
[1:38:43] TYK3E: ofc its ur job
[1:38:46] saren_x: NOIDONTTHINKSO
[1:38:48] Metrii: tbc is good
[1:38:50] pSovS: Cant see you drop the Vanilla Feeling you are Classic Enjoyer
[1:38:55] Fink108: GDKPS made people realize they dont have to farm gold for a guild raid it was always gonna kill guilds

[1:39:55] Zerfell: o7
[1:39:56] flowerpew: no point even AFKing to warm your room, retail is better for that smh
[1:40:01] ooTHExTUBEoo: TBC balancing was BiS, leveling was slightly improved from vanilla but wasn't too easy like wrath is with heirlooms and a 300 damage revenge at level 14
[1:40:02] Schlecktorr: thx for the turbo tax ads goozoo
[1:40:08] Nikoftz27: 3Head 15 pounds
[1:40:13] Trexbo_: @flowerpew om
[1:40:37] NoCamHd: I have so many characters across realms ( classic, HC, SoD ) that I got such a burnout and don't know which to play. How does the @Guzu-meister keep things fresh ?
[1:40:43] ooTHExTUBEoo: cata monkaS
[1:40:51] Yvernaa: Cata is similar to Wrath but it's a better expansion than Wrath
[1:40:57] pSovS: Yes
[1:40:57] Yaabbuu: yes
[1:40:59] Yaabbuu: they have
[1:41:00] wreckstormx: yes cata
[1:41:02] Asmii: Its in Cata
[1:41:05] StripSniper: end of cata
[1:41:05] Yaabbuu: you get a point every 3 levels i think
[1:41:07] Donnie_ofc: in mop
[1:41:07] Dutchlocked: later in cata
[1:41:08] Vocabhawk: cata trees shrink to 30 points
[1:41:09] molo316: more glyphs BatChest
[1:41:09] Donnie_ofc: no its not
[1:41:10] playerpersonx: not at the start of cata
[1:41:10] TheLugardi: no, its mop
[1:41:11] Mcgeezax90: cata squished trees
[1:41:13] Yvernaa: It's in MoP
[1:41:14] Yvernaa: Not Cata
[1:41:15] WookieliciousTV: MOP
[1:41:15] krulfar: no, its trees but smaller
[1:41:16] Joxtirol: no its a mop
[1:41:16] Diamond4aday: No changes in Cata and Mop
[1:41:18] Counter_99: no thats in mop
[1:41:20] Jellooze: didnt cata drop the hydrid spec?
[1:41:21] Elijahss: Noob chat
[1:41:22] Vocabhawk: MoP is when you get like 5
[1:41:24] Drife98: Cata has has point trees, reworked
[1:41:24] Donnie_ofc: cata is the same, just smaller
[1:41:24] Draknorz: no they just made it 31 points or something
[1:41:24] Myrror: No cata is every 2 levels
[1:41:26] molo316: new row of glyphs
[1:41:27] JoYneX: it is still a reworked tree in cata
[1:41:27] handsomesepheus: But you get a major ability at level 10
[1:41:28] molo316: aswell
[1:41:31] playerpersonx: in the start of cata we had condensed trees with talents every 2 levels
[1:41:36] juice_senpai: would it be a bush?
[1:41:38] wreckstormx: cata changes talent tree too tho
[1:41:42] Trexbo_: YEP
[1:41:48] molo316: reforging BatChest
[1:41:51] StreamElements: FULL game playthroughs of variety games and entire vods can be found here! https://www.youtube.com/@guzuvods196
[1:41:53] Diamond4aday: You have to Finish tree before going into other
[1:41:55] Yvernaa: Druid Talents in Cata quantGasm
[1:41:58] Trexbo_: You have to commit to one spec for majoirty of the levels
[1:41:58] StripSniper: You need to pick up the end talent to choose any other talent
[1:42:09] Yaabbuu: and you only can go to fury once you fill the arms tree
[1:42:11] flowerpew: they removed all the "1% crit% talents etc.
[1:42:13] o_0shak0_o: no more shit talents lijke 5 points for 5 crit
[1:42:14] Yaabbuu: yeah its stupid
[1:42:16] Trexbo_: YEP that kind of sucks
[1:42:18] TheLugardi: no
[1:42:19] Nunadaaa: cata talents suck
[1:42:20] Huntenn: Warriors get WF, arms
[1:42:22] ooTHExTUBEoo: DansGame
[1:42:24] wreckstormx: its fine
[1:42:25] Wimik: CATA IS JUST RETAIL
[1:42:28] Lorkahn: Streamlined design Guzu
[1:42:29] Wimik: cata sucks
[1:42:31] Yvernaa: I'm fine with that tbh
[1:42:32] Vocabhawk: don't worry, they're solved. You'll just run the same thing as everyone else
[1:42:32] Trexbo_: YEP
[1:42:34] Yvernaa: I never had an issue with it
[1:42:34] pSovS: Spend around 30 points i think
[1:42:36] kryhuan: I think you need to finish talent tree first to pick from another
[1:42:36] molo316: end talent should be picked Kappa
[1:42:37] EizenderTV: kill hybrid specs
[1:42:38] Nunadaaa: @Yverna14 i have :)
[1:42:39] krulfar: @Wimik its nothing like retail lmao
[1:42:39] Hyzen88: Cos of the mastery stat. you have to  be a certain spec
[1:42:44] virucs: noone was a fan of that
[1:42:45] vmttmv: cata was the first xpac to really change the game away from the traditional style
[1:42:46] Nefenn: It gave players less choice
[1:42:46] CoReRoded: lets ask the devs that designed the talent tree Clueless
[1:42:47] Yvernaa: @Nunadaaa fricc
[1:42:49] Counter_99: you can after you spend like 30 points
[1:42:52] Nunadaaa: YEP
[1:42:54] Nunadaaa: its fucked
[1:42:55] Trexbo_: Shruge It's just a different spec implementation
[1:42:56] Nunadaaa: @Yverna14 fricc
[1:42:56] Wimik: @krulfar cata is literally the beginning opf retail, it sucks
[1:42:58] Diamond4aday: Have to spend 31
[1:43:00] Lorkahn: 31
[1:43:03] BabaChaw: @Wimik you probably havent played retail since cata or that comment doesnt make sense. lol it is absolutely different
[1:43:04] vibbester: that doesn't matter @Guzu every lvl 80 wrath spec uses the final talent anyway besides raelly tryhard shadowpriests
[1:43:05] linleyy93: Good morning Guzu and chat :)<3
[1:43:07] p5ycc: I dont think cata sucks but the talents system not great
[1:43:10] Elijahss: people were to stupid to spec back then, and that fixed it.  Yet the MoP fix was even "better"
[1:43:14] wreckstormx: nah wod is beginning of retail
[1:43:18] its_me_: does it matter you are gonna pick the end talent anyways
[1:43:20] kri_kurilala: 2 fps video
[1:43:24] o_0shak0_o: its not relevant cause u are only having that "problem" for leveling
[1:43:25] kkefka: Firelands was a superb raid
[1:43:25] krulfar: @Wimik it sucks, but its not like retail at all
[1:43:28] Wimik: @BabaChaw wow is steadily downhill from cata, stopped playing in bfa
[1:43:28] Yvernaa: @its_me_ Ikr

[1:44:07] molo316: DRAGONS BatChest
[1:44:07] Myrror: Cata is the stepping stone to MoP (the best expansion), I plan to quit after mop; however, if they give WoD the sod treatment I'll consider it

[1:44:50] Goretech_: Raid content was great rest was terrible
[1:44:50] Mico027: cata was wow2, revemped everything
[1:44:51] playerpersonx: Cata is alright but you wont like it if Classic is your favorite. there's nothing to do in the world except for mount and pet collection, so you'll raid log like every other expansion after it

[1:51:50] Dutchlocked: @Hyzen88 Eh I don't know. I played retail for a year and the amount of times I saw random people interacting in the world can be counted on two hands. Much more actual human interraction in sod so far

[1:53:26] Hyzen88: @Dutchlocked I will admit, the interraction is in a different place on retail, its not visible in the open world like classic thats for sure, but you'll find great players and assholes usually in eaqual ammounts in both versions
[1:53:26] Zhriek89: COPIUMOVERDOSE is all i am hearing

[1:54:43] Yvernaa: Lich King Heroic was brutal for most people so people quit, also most people don't wanna play Cata I guess, that's why Wrath died quantHmm
