[0:42:37] 321boop: Played on Endless.  its ok
[0:43:09] TheUnknowing: Ah no that isn't a thing any more, they stopped development on that ages ago i believe
[0:43:10] Zettabyte: then we had that private server located "right next to" Blizz HQ @Towelliee or something like that

[3:09:39] markysal711: do you notice a lot of bots still?
[3:09:48] neverbornlucky: Retail the same as well till patch comes out chains
[3:09:53] Kromede: ketchup POGGERS
[3:10:23] i_EMP: decent amount in stv
[3:10:25] markysal711: did you notice a lot of people rerolling also for tbc?
[3:10:27] i_EMP: and arathi
[3:10:34] markysal711: trying to decide if i should reroll
[3:10:34] MuttonChopins: orgrimmar is really laggy in mankirk server
[3:10:49] Jarless: pro?
[3:11:10] neverbornlucky: I got my VR with the quest and elder scrolls to keep me busy during the wow wait for next lcontent
[3:11:21] ExtraCrazyFool: lol it keeps my herbs cheap on the market for my inscription
[3:12:10] krajar96: i reported a string of bots a few days ago and got in game mail saying that they took actions to fix that, probably an automated message right?

[3:12:14] Jay_rb: get to go into BC with all that gold so that gems will cost 1k
[3:12:19] Vanhoek: Its cause it errks people thinking its a pay to win model which is isnt. It actually has glaring disadvantages over a person that leveled 1 - 60
[3:12:20] sinawrx: Is winterfall firewater still expensive
[3:12:44] theDojoHobo: @sinawrx 7g on my server
[3:12:57] MuttonChopins: there is even an event going on with people wanting to move to a low pop server and have it be a like a "fresh" server event
[3:13:00] sinawrx: do you play on pve or pvp server
[3:13:05] theDojoHobo: pvp
[3:13:05] pavepawns: yo i just saw another ptr update
[3:13:09] neverbornlucky: I still think Blizzard should do faction changes in tbc for people
[3:13:12] pavepawns: and with a release candidate?
[3:13:15] pbnj_kills: im just saying the 58 boost guaranteed me to play bc
[3:13:15] sinawrx: thanks man
[3:13:20] SymphonyOnIce: TRUE
[3:13:32] pavepawns: i assume in a week
[3:14:01] Vanhoek: More people playing the game the better
[3:14:09] Vanhoek: which means they keep resources into the classic projects
[3:14:10] Gizadragon: plus blizzard love money why not
[3:14:31] 210Crawler: 210Crawler subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 18 months! to another year!
[3:15:05] pavepawns: id they did a mop classic thing i might be interested

[3:15:18] baroo6911: All I know is I will stay on TBC server and skip Wrath of any other crappy expansion
[3:16:03] linken18: @Towelliee what are your best memories from TBC back in 2007?
[3:16:03] Vanhoek: @pavepawns Mop isnt part of the classic scheme. Wrath is the last expansion that would be classified as classic. Cata on was part of the new age wow that is what makes up retail today

[3:16:04] zuna1904: tbh. who cares what someone is anti against. The Majority welcomes this
[3:16:10] pavepawns: im super anti tbc but thats probably cause my own personal experience in tbc
[3:16:21] DrakeDuude: You guys do a SHIT TON more than just play wow as a content creator. u know u do a lot more lol
[3:16:32] pavepawns: @vanhoek ye i meant more as a general if they would ever stray from the scheduled path
[3:16:38] Gizadragon: well said
[3:16:39] zuna1904: y u rep grinding ?
[3:16:45] MuttonChopins: ive mostly seen more people be pro boost than against boost
[3:16:47] neverbornlucky: I'm disabled I don't have to work for it just sit and do what I want when I want
[3:17:03] Vanhoek: Where you in favor of them staggering T4/T5/T6 content and not doing it how it was before? @Towelliee
[3:17:22] Vanhoek: were*
[3:17:23] zuna1904: oh u need the rep for more quests?
[3:17:24] Corbic247: @Towelliee reload ui. should have the quest pop up on map
[3:17:47] oliverdakiwi: I think people being against the boost disagree with the concept of a classic being a "Hardcore leveling experience" while the boost now completely defeats the purpose of those who give their time and dedication to level.
[3:18:07] pavepawns: i havent had an easy time sleeping cause i got excited by hearing there was elden ring leak :(
[3:18:13] MuttonChopins: WoW Tokens in Classic would be nice to have
[3:18:15] neverbornlucky: TBC is perfect for faction change cause of the shaman and paladin being added . I do not think people should be punished just because they weren't there before
[3:18:57] SymphonyOnIce: TRUE
[3:18:58] Vanhoek: What price do you think they would start the token at in TBC?
[3:19:03] Vanhoek: 1500 gold?
[3:19:06] Ishva: hey @Towelliee and chat, hows the lvling going?
[3:19:11] pavepawns: yo also off topic but hows the skin lotion situation going? you all good now or still taking it
[3:19:34] sinawrx: 250 is nothing
[3:19:37] danimoto10: are you going to  do a TBC marathon?
[3:19:39] Jay_rb: KEKW
[3:19:39] looseone: looseone subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 99 months, currently on a 99 month streak! 99 the dream is real! towHAMUP
[3:19:41] oliverdakiwi: 250 is way too cheap
[3:19:44] Jay_rb: 250 is gonna 1 gem
[3:19:53] I3Iackarrow: cant bots still farm trillions of gold and sell for tokens for $?  @towelliee
[3:19:56] Screamnsteam: 3rd party sites have a wow token worth 420g, not that i would know
[3:20:06] Plague_GG: $20 for 500g?
[3:20:11] Jay_rb: Yes
[3:20:23] sinawrx: so we really get to keep all our gold
[3:20:24] Vanhoek: for 1g = $0.02 - 0.04 atm
[3:20:28] partyanimalstone: yo what's up towelliee @Towelliee

[3:21:02] Corbic247: @Towelliee reload ui
[3:21:07] shocky_324: down south
[3:21:15] tekfury: so like every patch :(
[3:21:37] Vanhoek: Think there will be GDKP runs in TBC I feel thats what killed the market the most. I mean there was a GDKP run for Naxx that had the starting bid for the BiS healing mace @ 10k gold.
[3:21:45] partyanimalstone: yo what's up man @Towelliee
[3:21:52] partyanimalstone: you're zooming man
[3:22:19] TheUnknowing: I know people don't want changes like don't want tokens and etc, but ya know, times change and I think it could be beneficial
[3:22:29] fleesyo: Just buy gold like they did in classic lol
[3:22:31] I3Iackarrow: cant bots still farm trillions of gold and sell for tokens for $?  @towelliee
[3:22:36] GiraffeHydra_: They shouldnt be punished, we just shouldn't have to be in the economy with them. Fresh server solves the issue imo
[3:22:50] we_are_whomp: its harder for bot companies to make money bc of blizzard tokens it wouldn't be worth it
[3:22:53] Dime_Bag666: with classic is it worth just leveling though questing?
[3:22:56] we_are_whomp: esp if tokens are cheap
[3:23:10] partyanimalstone: yea they're still doing GDKP
[3:23:24] Mr_fantastic123: ppl will just run dungeon farms with prot paladins it dosent solve the problem
[3:23:24] GiraffeHydra_: its not different, but it sucked then too lol
[3:23:25] Darzetti_: Darzetti_ subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 38 months! HAM UP!
[3:23:48] partyanimalstone: i am sure they'll still do GDKP in TBC
[3:23:50] TheUnknowing: then your argument doesn't make sense @SensualMurderHornets , literally no different
[3:24:15] Vanhoek: Gold gets substantially easier to make in TBC and not from using weird means to get it. You can make a good amount of gold just from quests and dailies @ 70
[3:24:24] Jay_rb: YEP KEKW
[3:24:33] Kromede: amazing good XP ConcernDoge
[3:24:44] Vanhoek: @Towelliee Need to do SM runs man the xp is worth more than questing
[3:24:56] pavepawns: ur in the classic experience atm so u better enjoy it *throws 600xp at catform*
[3:25:23] partyanimalstone: yea
[3:25:24] GiraffeHydra_: @TheUnknowing I'm not sure how it doesnt make sense, if you want a better way of saying that its different from when tbc just released, I'd say its because vanilla was all there was then. This time, people knew tbc was coming afterwards, and those who had no interest in classic vanilla skipped it.
[3:25:28] Worgenrunt01: slootBoomer
[3:25:29] we_are_whomp: its easy to make tons of gold in bc
[3:25:37] we_are_whomp: and its not even that bad @ 60 in classic either
[3:25:40] MuttonChopins: mankirk is really laggy in org
[3:25:43] partyanimalstone: this server is super chill
[3:25:45] wolfgarb: what server are you on?
[3:25:50] partyanimalstone: azuresong
[3:25:54] wolfgarb: ok
[3:26:20] Artivicii: im inbetween azuresong and thunderfury rn

[3:26:30] Vanhoek: atleast you get it for free for the druid
[3:26:40] shocky_324: do you think they will bring back free transfers off the high pop servers when we get closer to tbc release?
[3:26:43] GiraffeHydra_: @TheUnknowing and just an fyi i've got no dog in this race, not planning on doing BC since my friends aren't, but I can see the poor guys group point of view
[3:26:50] ichrius85: maybe they should reward people that put in the effort in classic with a special title or something like that
[3:26:57] TheUnknowing: @SensualMurderHornets Nothing you said still makes sense, you are arguing about gold and inflated economy, same thing happened when tbc originally launched, etc. Your argument just had nothing to do with that
[3:27:06] worthy86: still have room in guild? thinking about transfering a toon
[3:27:31] Harch: Inflated economy just makes it easier for the plebs, more gold from farmed mats = quicker epic flying etc
[3:27:36] GiraffeHydra_: @TheUnknowing Alright, agree to disagree, not worth more of either of our time
[3:27:37] TheUnknowing: Poor guys or not it doesn't matter, people went into tbc poor cause they didn't play classic back then too, same thing as back then.

[3:33:47] CritcobainTV: when i started in TBC i was like 14 and i had no idea what addons were
[3:33:47] Daggerstry: Timezones were created to fight the ever growing train companies and how they randomly switched times to charge more money
[3:33:54] Artivicii: took me almost 6-7 weeks to get to 70 during TBC KEKW

[3:36:39] CritcobainTV: no date just 2021
[3:36:40] neverbornlucky: I almost got burnt out of wow during tbc because my Guild kept wanting me to tank. I was the one they called on to run noobs through to gear up
[3:37:10] spacemarine55: We’re gonna get layering I’m sure
[3:37:58] pavepawns: @neverbornlucky i almost got burnt out aswell from just overall being forced to help new ppl all the time but also tempest keep being the worst raid experience ever

[3:41:05] we_are_whomp: 30-33 for the nesingwary starters
[3:41:14] dcmaniac11: Hopefully rogue solo leveling is easier in bc than it was in classic
[3:41:16] we_are_whomp: i'd go arathi first
[3:41:17] pavepawns: if i ever do try tbc im just gonna be a braindead hunter and take it the easy route

[5:03:54] nixxy_7: but you trusted that comercial that said hey buy now only 999.99$ from 50k $
[5:04:33] Daggerstry: My favorite thing is the streamers that went from high viewers on retail to now exclusively streaming classic and then questioning why their viewership went down. Like bro.... your content is stale now that you only do Classic

[5:33:07] parlangua89: I love shadowlands, i loved BFA and i loved legion. i love wow. till it dies i will play haha.
[5:33:21] PadidinJones: @Towelliee I do not like the AP/anima this expac. It comes out so little and rare.
[5:33:28] invinzi: Are you gonna tank with this druid in tbc ?
[5:33:38] Hjolt: i did farm anima at the start, then after being kinda forced to switch covenant i just stopped, and eventually stopped playing, too.
[5:33:42] phantomstranja: my first like 1k hours into shadowlands was amazing but once the dust settled, i was like oh i see what this is, im kinda done

[5:34:16] CritcobainTV: It just feels like there's no point for me to do anything. I didn't even raid this week man. LUL
[5:34:24] PadidinJones: I just started Ember court yesterday.
[5:34:24] Moorishak: olboll no, god no. wait for valor gear, bcs you need farm now one from M+
[5:34:26] CritcobainTV: I'm like 224 ilvl and there's almost nothing more i can get
[5:34:27] itsureis: so is Torghast garbo? I haven't really paid attention since beta lol
[5:34:32] nixxy_7: @PadidinJones the reason why Anima comes so slow and takes so long its because players complained last expansions where you could farm millions of azeritte etc and lvls scaled high  in numbers :) its community feedback not blizz fault there
[5:34:35] Supers18: I love grinding the maw
[5:34:41] ShadoodHD: KEKW
[5:34:50] utimtm123: You can buy pages in Auc man

[5:35:37] nezz231: prosit
[5:35:38] parlangua89: shadowlands issues is 1000% the community fault.
[5:35:53] Blastaho: botty bay

[5:36:17] I3Iackarrow: BOTTY bay ah filled 99% of pages
[5:36:23] shocky_324: uc*
[5:36:27] nixxy_7: @PadidinJones thats community fault they got complacemenet that why am i getting 5mil azerite a day from wq ? those numbers are insane.. they made a ticket and blizz decided to add smaller nr. less get :)

[6:53:29] Daggerstry: This just in! Blizzard soon to announce BfA Classic

[7:07:09] nuckinfuts617: so how do these new servers work? are you not able to make draenei/blood elves on the current servers, only new?
[7:07:12] Tiamattinen: watching classic gameplay kind of makes me want to resubscribe. For some reason it seems more relaxing than SL

[7:07:47] Ropo86: @Towelliee what tank u gonna play in tbc?
[7:07:47] bakurathewolf: when well that ahlp / bate start  got  any dates?
[7:07:53] pavepawns: cant blame people for going hunter. having that 1 button playstyle in tbc makes it easy
[7:08:08] sedge01: Ferals/Guardians do nice damage last tier with all armor pen gems. Off tank and go cat when you drop eggroll
[7:08:13] SSD511_: Dam I forgot today is reeee day
[7:08:16] crazelol424: @Towelliee do u think its worth lvling now for tbc? im lvl 20, or just wait for boost

[7:09:16] Ropo86: @Towelliee U going druid or pala for tanking?
[7:09:18] nuckinfuts617: @crazelol424 I started leveling to do something else besides shadowlands..just leveling casually.. I mean if you like to play, try leveling it and save the boost for a 2nd character
[7:09:31] crazelol424: ye true
[7:09:41] Towelliee: !tbc
[7:09:41] Moobot: We want YOU for a WoW TBC raiding guild! Apply now! || http://towelliee.com/tbc || We will be choosing Azuresong Horde for our TBC server! Start leveling now! || Not playing Pally, no Blood Elfs yet || No TBC Launch date yet.
[7:09:52] nuckinfuts617: I'm leveling a priest and gonna use my boost on either a druid or shaman
[7:09:58] pavepawns: but it says not playing pally D;
[7:10:05] pavepawns: he lied to us!
[7:10:13] sedge01: Shield throw is pro for dungeons. I used to run a lot with prot pallas
[7:10:18] zoobu2: do you think rerolling to a more needed class is worth? rogue seems so unwanted in raids and i want to gear up and progress in each tier
[7:10:19] pavepawns: so blood elf warrior then
[7:10:24] pavepawns: :3
[7:10:39] bakurathewolf: how much gold you got drom questing?
[7:10:40] Tiamattinen: there's the real power of druid leveling. Just one Healing Touch and you can just go straight back to cat and level again
[7:10:47] sprert: you can't put the makro on 2-9 because these keys are already reserverd for "/s LOL Top dps"-makros
[7:10:59] Tyrsfal: What is blizz's attitude to the token for TBC as i know they've adopted some changes so far
[7:11:01] sedge01: T5 Trinket from SSC will help a lot
[7:11:14] pavepawns: @sprert no you add that into the 1 press button rotation
[7:11:52] pavepawns: we talking tbc or shadowlands tho?
[7:12:01] sprert: @pavepawns oh that is a good optimization idea. hope the guides for tbc hunters will include that^^
[7:12:05] crazelol424: well tbf most classes are viable end tbc
[7:12:12] Pufendorf99: Cant really remember a spec that were really bad.

[7:14:06] Jaboyy: survival is just there for MD and debuff
[7:14:35] OG_Carroll_4L: BM is the damage so hunters will go that unless a guild makes them go survival
[7:14:36] Jaboyy: every raid can use like 5 resto sham
