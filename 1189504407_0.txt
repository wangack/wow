[3:58:29] rbubbaray: throw hatchet, dont need ammo
[3:58:44] diabl712: swift check our your movement speed lol
[3:58:59] Slamtax: Heavy all the way
[3:59:13] Notugle: I saw someone play with hammer over axe and no one could kill him. He was so good at blocking shots from muskets.
[3:59:15] diabl712: see the permanent blood lust buff
[3:59:21] rbubbaray: I us it for pulls and hunting , not to fight
[3:59:21] diabl712: its a bug from this patch
[3:59:22] chris90502: Is it fun that everyone uses the same weapon?

[4:00:04] curzer: you can stack 5 buff foods = 6% hp all 2,5 sec
[4:00:09] diabl712: but this patch its bugged and you can get it permanently
[4:00:18] MicrosoftDotCom: hola tio, como estas @Swifty
[4:00:23] diabl712: it goes away sometimes too lol
[4:00:44] diabl712: so there is a meme now where people consider great axe a mount
[4:01:12] Synthica86: if u change weapons its gone
[4:01:30] rbubbaray: how is using axe and hammer combo ?
[4:01:56] Notugle: with that 1 hand and shield build you don't need axe go Hammer for the stun and cc
[4:02:21] rbubbaray: right

[4:02:48] rbubbaray: yeah .lol
[4:02:57] diabl712: you really need to learn to dodge well as great axe/warhammer to win in pvp
[4:03:21] CoeurDeLeon: swifty cast sacred ground on the ground and spam crouch - take a look thats the combo you should be running atm
[4:03:24] diabl712: I mean in general as a great axe/warhammer build
[4:04:00] diabl712: I like medium. Light is too squishy
[4:04:07] sickwidit33: they shoulda called the game "the bug world" @swifty
[4:04:36] StreamElements: Viewers and Subscribers generate points! You can redeem them at store for on screen effects! https://streamelements.com/swifty/store
[4:04:46] diabl712: I think you can chase a mob for a while and it sticks
[4:04:52] rbubbaray: everyone was light for rolls, now everyone went heavier. cause light to soft
[4:04:52] Notugle: what word am i'm using that is being blocked?
[4:04:56] diabl712: it normally only works if you are within 15m
[4:05:05] ThatMayBeTheCase: Light armor is so damn bad, the 20% damage increase is of your base damage, so at level 60 it's like only  a 5% total damage increase. Heavy is just the way to go right now
[4:05:15] diabl712: you have to face the mob
[4:05:18] diabl712: not your crosshair

[4:06:12] Notugle: go hammer for now
[4:06:27] kitkatz07: but its not 100% bugged because it definitely works for me
[4:06:31] diabl712: man, I dont even want to play great axe without blood lust working correctly lol
[4:06:32] kitkatz07: so not everyone has the bug
