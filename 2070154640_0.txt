[4:47:30] apple_beard: HmmNotes
[4:47:30] shinezlightz: flawless explaination Graycen
[4:47:31] draqcula: @TuPpTup hate it in pvp
[4:47:48] baboonya: Can people still run normal gnomeregan(non-raided)?
[4:47:48] choppeddx: 20 years of wow and they finally realized the first version was always the best
[4:47:59] Tatranskymedved: thanks! sounds great
[4:48:00] TuPpTup: lol gotta love it @draqcula
[4:48:01] ripinpeace10: @Graycen will lvl 50 be strat raid? thats gonna be so so so sick
[4:48:07] burningrob: 60 raids are gonna be nuts youre gonna want alts to be able to try them out
[4:48:30] draqcula: @TuPpTup  RAGEY
[4:48:34] AllieQuack: ABOBA 2
[4:48:38] burningrob: yeah it gives me time to run about 5 toons and gear them well
[4:48:51] SmellyGoatZ: peepoHey @burningrob mcretHeart
[4:48:52] Jeff_dd: cannt wait to play demon hunter at 60
[4:48:54] Jeff_dd: BatChesting
[4:48:55] Anckael: Hopefully they'll make classic
[4:48:56] choppeddx: ive leveld too many times in this game to care to have alts anymore warrior bis
[4:49:02] ripinpeace10: @Graycen you think stratholme will be the next raid?
[4:49:04] TuPpTup: you think theyll do the 50 percent xp buff to 40 next phase?
[4:49:16] handgestured: I cant wait to play classic wow for the next 20 years
[4:49:20] baldanduseless: maura
[4:49:22] burningrob: BRD is the next raid
[4:49:23] baboonya: next raid will be sunken temple
[4:49:23] baldanduseless: or sunken
[4:49:29] draqcula: omg sunken temple
[4:49:32] draqcula: that would be cool
[4:49:36] Rosiiwun: meow
[4:49:37] burningrob: sunken temple could be good with a strong revamp
[4:49:39] Elijahss: it is gonna  be ZF
[4:49:39] ripinpeace10: @Graycen didnt they tease kara crypts at blizzcon? when is that coming?
[4:49:42] moa285: danseparty
[4:49:46] My_keI: 6 hour brd raids KEKW
[4:49:46] Hyperiun: it'll be mara
[4:49:49] JTRoyson: ST would suck
[4:49:51] Anckael: My problem with SoD is that its a seasonal realm, not really motivated to play a temporary mode
[4:49:53] konda138: brd in 2 parts, in 50 and 60 YEP
[4:49:55] GlobalWarming: blizzard is treating sod like a seasonal game, and wow has always been a seasonal game for most people
[4:49:57] Elijahss: @Hyperiun that is a good guess
[4:49:58] YzieGG: if they take away BRD players will be mad KEKW
[4:49:59] JTRoyson: brd raid would be fire
[4:49:59] burningrob: Mara raid?
[4:50:00] baldanduseless: st would go hard
[4:50:06] baldanduseless: already has built in mechanics
[4:50:07] AllieQuack: I bet it will be ZF
