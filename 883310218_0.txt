[2:47:47] itz_epiiic: Damage is reduced after 5 targets.
[2:48:04] StoicTaurus: Disco is good for organised groups.. Holy better for Pugs. But noone switch beteen specs, so 'good priests' play Disco even while holy would be better for dungeon with randoms
[2:48:06] itz_epiiic: for ashen hallow
[2:48:13] WoW_StandalonE: rdruid haver the healing numbers but dont bring anything extra to the raid
[2:48:19] Todmeister9000: @Artivicii it got cancelled because of covid
[2:48:39] itz_epiiic: Nothing about holy priest is good in dungeons.
[2:48:49] idenkaz_: nah resto druid is doing fine in raids as well. havent seen people struggle on healing in raids up to HC. mythic is out of the question for most ppl anyways.
[2:48:52] Artivicii: @WoW_StandalonE BR? typhoon, roots, etc
[2:49:03] Artivicii: they even have stampeding roar now
[2:49:04] StoicTaurus: Holy is reactive spec that can heal through lot of shit

[2:49:46] Molvonos: Indie seems to do pretty well in higher keys, but we're talking 8-10, not 14s and higher.
[2:49:48] itz_epiiic: The only thing a holy priest has is GS, they dont do hardly any damage etc. Disc has barrier, ps, and can pump damage as well.
[2:49:50] WoW_StandalonE: @Artivicii shamans have it too and bringg more healing
[2:50:09] iunbearable: Holy fun to play?
[2:50:14] itz_epiiic: II would take a disc priest over a holy priest by a long shot.

[4:02:25] Tiggaboo: and making triple the cash on PoE
[4:02:32] Rottencoarse: he is dropping out after this cup
[4:02:52] beckto: I just had a flashback to when you blasted "Big Booty B!tches"
[4:02:58] Rottencoarse: @Towelliee lightee made 12k by streaming PoE last week XD
[4:03:00] CritcobainTV: @I_DoctorSatan_I POG grats bro
[4:03:17] Rottencoarse: and he is going to take 1600 from the cup if they win
[4:03:29] josh8555: ouch
[4:03:31] MrGattz: its not sad poe is just a better game. loot actually drops

[4:04:29] SlayerLightStorm: Man, I haven't played PoE in a HOT minute.
[4:04:35] Pojotmc: tbh, they treat their own developers that way. They underpay relative to the industry because of the "prestige" or working at blizzard
[4:04:39] I_DoctorSatan_I: WoW MDI have set Mythic affixes by Blizzard or they follow weekly affixes?
[4:04:42] Cudqt: This league is good @SlayerLightStorm
[4:04:42] Thoreya: im just glad the pvp streamers are getting hella good viewership
[4:04:43] mobbo: That’s their choice
[4:05:04] CritcobainTV: They may not get good contracts but a lot of them stream too and make a ton of cash from that, like pika and cdew
[4:05:05] thebakeriscomingforu: with esports Blizz doesn't know what they are doing.
[4:05:06] Melteoc: @Towelliee and sadly for blizz, POE league Ritual is awesome
[4:05:50] jasperboy: didnt take long, but Northerngaming was bought by NRG

[4:06:18] Cudqt: i mean poe
[4:06:28] Cudqt: this league and new expansion mechanic is sick
[4:06:30] KingSlayerYotam: blizz just puts the lowest effort possible
[4:06:32] loveandpeace2all: blizzard just uses people
[4:06:32] DeanoTV: yea but poe is not casual friendly
[4:06:45] mobbo: 0 chance
[4:06:49] mobbo: Yea lol
[4:06:53] MrGattz: poe is casual friendly for sure. you got 10 mins? run a map.
[4:06:53] CritcobainTV: OTK just started, no way they have that much money to pay big on contracts
[4:06:54] Melteoc: @MrGattz so true and not an over statement
[4:06:55] Tanarriss: who is playing poe instead of wow?
[4:07:13] loveandpeace2all: scandal?
[4:07:13] DeanoTV: alot of people were complaining about it being too complicated in the trailer
[4:07:17] maacckk_: Love your hat @Towelliee !!
[4:07:22] Thoreya: i do think just in general tho blizzard half asses a lot of important things
[4:07:24] mobbo: ScoPaterno
[4:07:25] DeanoTV: not many can stick to poe
[4:07:26] 3v3r35t_: Are you glad to see Method slowly getting back to where they were before
[4:07:28] Cudqt: poe has a high entry learning curve
[4:07:37] Cudqt: but once you know, its pretty easy to be casual
[4:07:39] Thoreya: whether its bc they have to or whatever else a lot of stuff seems half assed
[4:07:42] Navastro: Why not make the pool prize be funded by players with some skin or sth like Valve is doing with Dota
[4:07:54] hiihails: Hiii ! I just started watching you during my days at work. I really appreciate your content :)
[4:07:58] TheVigiliance: And lightee won in 3 days, so no MDI jail for 2 weeks before they actually compete
[4:08:01] Antdavs24: theres financial incentive to push to a higher level, unfortunately blizz doesnt treat it that way with their "e-sports"
[4:08:04] josh8555: its capped with blizzard you can only have so much money
[4:08:08] Melteoc: @Towelliee well to be honest gotta give some credit to Zizarian for making a good POE thing

[4:08:28] KingSlayerYotam: blizz stole some money
[4:08:33] MrGattz: @DeanoTV poe itself is a very very very complex game when you first start out. its not new player friendly at all and the devs have even said its not for new players. but you can learn it over time in small chunks for sure
[4:08:44] I_DoctorSatan_I: Blizzard F'd up when they went to YT tho
[4:08:48] WoW_StandalonE: ouch
[4:08:53] loveandpeace2all: Think how much these players make for the company.... a portion that money should be paid to them
[4:08:57] Antdavs24: @Towelliee 100% facts, that doesnt work in any form of gaming
[4:09:01] naughtyforyou: Big facts

[4:09:16] Captain_nShaneO: *inserts "fuck them kids" meme*
[4:09:49] loveandpeace2all: the whole value of your company comes from the employees but we pay the parasites at the top take all the money
[4:09:53] TheVigiliance: Whaazz didn't even know how much he got paid for AWC this time, he just want to compete
[4:10:12] Antdavs24: or they make enough money from other sources where they can invest 'free time' into an MDI

[4:15:32] loveandpeace2all: blizzard is a 16 year old company...that fired their best programmers... these issues were known during the two phases of testing.... yet, blizzard leaves this crap in the game... just to harass us
[4:16:00] SorionTheGinger: @loveandpeace2all i think it's specifically to harass you, personally
[4:16:01] thebakeriscomingforu: like actors with big payouts. Assume 65 to 75% of that payout isn't theirs
[4:16:03] TheUnknowing: blizzard is way more thna 16 years old bro xD WoW is like 16 years old, not blizz.

[4:17:12] loveandpeace2all: sorionz did I say it was me personally? Ass-u-me much?
[4:17:21] Antdavs24: i think thats probably what keeps him around, but hes also in a good org. i wonder if he'd be that passionate without having GG behind him
[4:17:41] Talason: shadowlands came out with less dungeons than bfa
[4:17:51] Talason: they are phasing them out maybe

[4:18:07] loveandpeace2all: its all of us... 380+ pulls on a bugging boss in mythic raid? they spent days of harassment...for what?
[4:18:15] SorionTheGinger: @loveandpeace2all thats the most random insult i have ever read. I thought it would make you feel better to know that blizzard is on a personal vendetta against you and you only, so i decided to share that little tidbit i know =)
[4:18:16] I_DoctorSatan_I: @Talason that will never happen because of the gearing aspect
[4:18:18] Armdel: Love my warrior in m+ after getting the tormented kings legendary. i got a CD's for almost every trash pack in dungeons

[4:25:15] ravenwingz0405: your question is a customer issue
[4:25:17] RocketMan23: all the other packs arent that bad

[4:28:32] RocketMan23: i keep looking at the prot pally pushers on keys and they seem to use blessed hammers for really high keys and im so confused why

[4:29:13] KaisenSiru: 2020Snacking
[4:29:27] Hayds21: @RocketMan23 probably cuz it allows them to kite more
[4:29:30] Artivicii: @rocketman23 for melee heavy dungeons like sanguine and halls, mists. But also really good for aoe threat on fortified weeks
[4:29:37] RocketMan23: @Hayds21 ya thats what i was thinking
[4:29:41] xHukk: I'm not that kinda tank. I mean.. Im not gunna expect to stay alive.. if healer has no mana. What kinda logic is that. lmfao
[4:29:56] Artivicii: @rocketman23 and the extra dps is huge for fortified weeks
[4:30:08] thebakeriscomingforu: @SylverFawks bear tanks are doing well at the moment. Not DH well, but they are solid tanks
[4:30:31] Artivicii: @xhukk throughput is more important than mana

[4:39:02] BfAleTitan: they never said you would get a different slot with each reward choice lol
[4:39:04] RocketMan23: well at least its more opportunities, in bfa it was one shot and thats it
[4:39:11] sarcilav: you need adjust
[4:39:13] xHukk: @Towelliee We can go back to old loot system from BFA, if you prefer that? SeemsGood
[4:39:15] sarcilav: you extra pulled before
[4:39:26] xHukk: This is the best loot system I've seen.
[4:39:39] RocketMan23: once big boi is down, middle is no issue

[4:39:54] michaelmm: @BFAleTitan Actually during the beta they said exactly that when the issue of duplicates was raised at the time.
[4:39:54] bertooso: I just don’t understand the drop rate for m plus
[4:39:58] xHukk: What? Don't kill spitefuls? How will they pad DPS?
[4:40:07] Lordcookkiie: Lordcookkiie subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 59 months! 
[4:40:10] BfAleTitan: @michaelmm interesting, do you know where they said that?
[4:40:18] XuremGaming: I think accessibility-wise it's definitely an improvement, but choice-wise the vault absolutely needs some tweaking
[4:40:31] RocketMan23: thats a bold move cotton
[4:40:43] siya05: the dot they put down
[4:40:45] siya05: is insane
[4:40:53] FresheFefe: LUL
[4:40:58] kha0068: don't do it
[4:41:30] Mecabeast: I think for 9.1 remove loot from keys, and give a currency instead that scales and add a vendor to buy dungeon gear then another that can upgrade. also let us upgrade the m0 drops so we don't necessarily have to purchase the pieces.
[4:41:33] I_DoctorSatan_I: @Xurem0 What if there was a drop down menu on one piece of gear...like a 220 Cloak, would have addtional 3 options to choose from if the stats are not favorable. Then the cloak "loot table" rotates. You follow?
[4:41:45] RocketMan23: i swear dps never ever stun the stealthling cast
[4:42:17] Drakenking: You could stun it but it would be recast quickly
[4:42:23] XuremGaming: @I_DoctorSatan_I Yeah that'd be pretty dope tbh. Instead of taking up vault slots with the same type of piece

[4:42:57] I_DoctorSatan_I: @Xurem0 So, instead of getting that trash Crit / Verse Cloat stats, yuo can choose your BiS stats so you're actually getting a good choice of gear instead of "you get what you get".
[4:43:00] xHukk: @Mecabeast So no loot from dungeons? Or raids?
[4:43:35] Keefara: does anyone know what the name of his nameplates are

[4:54:17] CritcobainTV: most dungeons im around 5k overall, but I was trying new trinkets
[4:54:54] CritcobainTV: @Towelliee if you did RBGS to cap your points, you have to win one arena game and it'll be 220
[4:55:07] bennythejet_ne: I think final stand is a decent dps loss but still probably worth it

[4:58:40] angmaster: you retrive mechanical lion
[4:58:40] CosmicPooky: I'm just still annoyed that we had the QB but wouldn't draft the OL and now we have the OL and now QB :(
[4:58:45] PToastman: UwU
[4:58:45] Gruffian: He's a good backup though.
[4:58:51] TastyBama: I went on a two week vacation for the holidays, now i feel like its too much of a grind :(
[4:58:51] hagmania: gotta get the cat
[4:58:54] boootybuttcheeks: Lol he doesn’t show up in big games. Lions will probably trade him for a 3rd rounder LUL
[4:58:58] bigbambooski: lol...
[4:58:59] Smidz_: why has NA had the bell twice before EU?
[4:59:14] eyemyor: @Towelliee See, the D linemen cant read. They see Brissett and they think "Brisket" and they just plow the O line to eat his face because they're hungry/.
[4:59:17] Revelations45: whats going on in here
[4:59:19] Sollice: @Towelliee The game has a real problem right now with landing. Like I got DCed 4 times on the gravity brawl

[4:59:44] hagmania: how do you get the last renown this week? just doing dungeons/bgs?
[4:59:47] Antdavs24: he'd have 100 rushing yds a game him self KEKW
[4:59:49] SwordShot: Steelers are in trouble thats all i know... their cap is rough
[4:59:52] jbeastb: if they trade him within the divison they should be forced to sell the team
[4:59:53] biglos67: they want a trade like hershell walker deal to get him
[4:59:53] Spaede: I could see if the Texans are doing everything they can to mess that up
[4:59:53] griffdog125: the steelers take Haskins. ehh
[5:00:12] laughing_octopus: @Towelliee on NW 2nd boss CC the adds and u dont need to kill them
[5:00:12] Captain_nShaneO: i dont think the texans would ever trade a franchise talent to a divisional foe
[5:00:21] laughing_octopus: @Towelliee makes the boss super easy
[5:00:32] Antdavs24: steelers done for a while, haskins aint it lol

[5:00:57] Sollice: Who IN THE FUCK trades Hopkins
[5:01:05] JORDYYYYS: Nah, whenever you have the campaign finished you get only 2 per week
[5:01:06] jeneraljelly: traded hopkins for pennies on the dolar
[5:01:07] Antdavs24: Texans good for botched trades lol
[5:01:11] torvoltas: @Towelliee go to cave bellow

[5:10:47] takix42: That's neat but the first mobs help for prideful on 1st boss
[5:10:52] jeneraljelly: i mean mists is already the easiest dungeon by far
[5:10:55] Spaede: It’s super clutch if for some reason you don’t have a DH
[5:10:58] Sollice: You can make that up at the end with extra worm packs cant you?

[5:11:07] lokifenrir1: any gifters?
[5:11:12] MrGattz: well the % is fine, last boss you just kill the other platforms after you kill the boss

[6:31:02] Jaygeh: @Towelliee random question. have a friend thats a tank pally and he gets 1 shot in hc. hes using the correct talents etc and is 206ilvl but dying to a melee on hungering or m+ any clue why? his uptime on shield etc is high too
[6:31:03] deckardblade: they arent going to do anything until 9.1 unfortunately i bet
[6:31:09] mrpresbaby: @Towelliee did you see the NZXT computer shoes powered by a 3080?
[6:31:15] Doomster59: yea im done if they dont change anything
[6:31:17] mwchaos: that thing preach was talking about doesnt really seem like a super great solution to the loot deficit atm either @Towelliee
[6:31:55] mwchaos: basically you get badges from M+ that you turn in
[6:32:01] Masqerader: ew
[6:32:03] mwchaos: similar to conquest for pvp gear but pve gear
[6:32:13] Revelations45: back to BC we go
[6:32:26] mrpresbaby: would you get that from raiding too?
[6:32:29] akia03: valor points might eassier to do
[6:32:29] mwchaos: that seems like hot garbage, tuning mythic loot drops would be a great start
[6:32:36] thespudc1: Just bring back Valor system GG.
[6:32:38] thebakeriscomingforu: badge vendor
[6:32:47] Revelations45: or bump up the damn Ilvl
[6:32:52] Revelations45: for M plus
[6:32:53] mwchaos: raid and m+*
[6:32:54] Captain_nShaneO: bring back badges BibleThump
[6:32:55] Zansteh: DefinetlyNotValor system

[6:32:56] Crowzcut: towelcoins

[6:33:01] cahoots82: Rolav System

[6:33:04] smashwow: some type of currency is a start. but they need to buff the ilvl as well.
[6:33:10] reffan: requiem badges
[6:33:12] akia03: sinstones to stay in sl theme
[6:33:24] Throdio: They should call it, Yet another Anima Currency
[6:33:32] CritcobainTV: i just think that M+ needs to drop 1-2 more pieces of gear per run and it would be a lot better

[6:34:08] ManneehFresh: higher key unlock higher ilvl
[6:34:12] Chrisfo79: Make people able to upgrade gear comparable towards the key lvl you have done, similar to the pvp gearing system.
[6:34:13] mwchaos: it seems pretty ridiculous that m15 drops 210 also, I get that you shouldnt outgear the raids from dungeons but there needs to be a happy medium
[6:34:13] akia03: buy m0 and upgrade tp your highest done key via points
[6:34:14] Clicklesly: Wouldn't they just repurpose anima for this then?
[6:34:28] TexValhalla: Towelliee I found your next pair of shoes LUL

[6:34:34] NILLme: killing X amount of mythic bosses allowing you to upgrade gear to 226 will be amazing
[6:34:36] Captain_nShaneO: it's almost like they purposely drop the ball to get people talking about the game more... there's no way they could be this incompetent after all these expansions
[6:34:37] RocketMan23: some way to get a 233 weapon would be nice too from dungeons
[6:34:41] Masqerader: Or they can revert the loot change they implemented for raids/dungeons #pulltheripcord
[6:34:46] mrpresbaby: @GrittyTexan yeah I just tried to bring it up to him

[6:35:38] mrpresbaby: check it @Towelliee
[6:35:39] Provision_: @katsou07 doesn't work here LUL
[6:35:45] fistco: How is it not simple to revert the change made in the first place?
[6:35:47] reffan: its so much worse, and then m+ is bad
[6:35:51] fistco: It's pretty simple, actually.
[6:35:57] mrpresbaby: they're going to sell them
[6:35:58] falldrgn: wow..
[6:36:00] mrpresbaby: it's a computer
[6:36:05] TheCliffyShow: Hi, everybody!
[6:36:05] mrhyydd: Hit all those home runs on beer and hot dogs. Not on the juice.
[6:36:08] smashwow: i'd rather they be incompetent than doing this on purpose
[6:36:20] Korgmorg: Just add pvp stat back @towelliee
[6:36:30] TexValhalla: @towelliee check discord LUL
[6:36:31] RocketMan23: LUL
[6:36:33] egraves7: LUL
[6:36:33] akia03: got to keep those 6 month subs rollin
[6:36:34] Chrisfo79: LUL
[6:36:48] Daggerstry: These names
[6:36:56] falldrgn: whos reporting that hank arron passed?
[6:37:02] TheCliffyShow: Hi, everybody!
[6:37:04] treeni13: Miss you bro. Hope all is well!!
[6:37:09] Captain_nShaneO: if they get it perfect, people will start bitching about how nothing is "new" and it's the same ole same ole.. when they try all this different stuff that doesn't work, it's garbage.. it's almost like a lose lose lol
[6:37:09] mwchaos: they have to do some sort of scaling on mythic raid drops cause the current system is abysmal, trying to get pieces on 20 people more than once a week from an rng vault lol
[6:37:23] mo197: Notre Dame on probation for recruiting violations...lol
[6:37:33] temp3st98: valor and justice points?
[6:37:39] chrispape: no one likes RNG
[6:37:39] Affiiance: Literally just make a badge syatem like the PvP System and all is fixed IMO
[6:37:42] CADZtv: i like how we are just going back to the system that worked now
[6:37:43] Captain_nShaneO: @Temp3sTcsgo i think that was the perfect system
[6:37:45] Dragonsland7: Bring CORRUPTION back! lol
[6:37:47] Masqerader: The community is responsible for the current shit loot system
[6:37:56] Xailen: Most unrewarding expansion EVER.
[6:38:10] Captain_nShaneO: at least with badges i knew i was working my way towards something if i didn't get loot back in wrath
[6:38:13] Sollice: Let anima be used to purchase gear
[6:38:14] Daggerstry: I am at an issue in that my best conduit is at 171 and there seems to be no way in game to upgrade it
[6:38:15] mwchaos: this shit loot system is still better than past loot systems
[6:38:21] NILLme: valor points as honor equivalent. Killing X amount of bosses let you upgrade gear up to that difficulty
[6:38:23] Affiiance: The current Loot System isnt far from being perfect, just give PvE a vendor and all is good
[6:38:28] TheCliffyShow: The community asks for stuff without thinking about it fully.
[6:38:38] Gnral: how w d you compare tbc system with sl
[6:38:49] reffan: for currency why not just use anima?
[6:39:11] Captain_nShaneO: @reffan because there's a drought and we need it for more important things Kappa
[6:39:15] akia03: @reffan they would need to up the rate you get anima first
[6:39:21] CritcobainTV: Cause people already have a ton of anima, so they would just instantly have full gear @reffan
[6:39:27] mwchaos: yeah thats more or less what preach was getting at in his video @Towelliee
[6:39:34] NILLme: nah tokens are still rng
[6:39:35] L4dy_Renegade: I miss the reforging system, not that it helps the gear drop situation but.
[6:39:38] Masqerader: downside is Blizzard is dumb and will make the grind for a badge system stupid tedious
[6:39:38] Throdio: Being able to upgrade raid gear would be nice as well. Something like 10 ilvls, that way you get more powerful gear, and it won't make the next raid difficulty pointless
[6:39:39] reffan: or actually make the maw relevant by adding it to venari?
[6:39:43] Choderz: i dont want tokens lol
[6:39:48] Choderz: give me valor points
[6:39:54] CritcobainTV: Titanforging was bis Kappa
[6:39:57] bicchiaki: i really think they made loot so hard to get bc they wanna keep people playing longer for their sub numbers but at the same time... some of my friends already quit BC of the reward system so lmao
[6:40:04] bec0o: but why they fighting mytic and forcing ppl to pvp?
[6:40:05] CritcobainTV: @Towelliee just bring back corruptions KEKW
[6:40:06] NILLme: let us work towards gaining better gear without RNG
[6:40:07] katsou07: there needs to be a skill cap for it though
[6:40:15] smashwow: also you want the currency to come from the content you're grinding. (e.g.) pvp gear is honor. you don't use anima for it. needs to follow the same structure.
[6:40:15] Draz3nx: how would you get said valor?
[6:40:20] mwchaos: basically you get X amount of badges scaling with your key level/completion/etc etc and then you turn those in to upgrade pve gear
[6:40:20] Nickydo0: yup like the good ol days
[6:40:23] Captain_nShaneO: the reason they won't do that though is because once a character is "max" they are afraid people will stop playing which means < sub money
[6:40:24] Sollice: @shinjoaki That is exactly why they did what they did. It may be back firing on them though
[6:40:34] EpicJune: knowing blizz they will do currency you give to an NPC and they gives you a random item KEKW
[6:40:41] NILLme: it should cost a lot more honor
[6:40:53] Captain_nShaneO: they want you to be on that treadmill as looong as possible til you get off.. i wouldn't be shocked if they changed the pvp gearing next patch for that reason since it's so easy
[6:40:55] bicchiaki: @Sollice :/ hope they realize not too late
[6:41:04] smashwow: don't worry guys we'll get a vendor in the 9.3 patch Kappa
[6:41:09] Gnral: 200 iq
[6:41:22] mwchaos: could you imagine the outcry from the pvp community though lol they were already mad about the 550 cap weekly @Towelliee
[6:41:22] L4dy_Renegade: World of RNGcraft. Kappa
[6:41:24] Sollice: Well... I think the biggest complaint, from what I can see anyways, is loot. And people have already left because of it
[6:41:24] Masqerader: Don't worry Blizzard will fuck up any pve grinding system for badges/currency or w/e and make it way worse still than pvp
[6:41:24] oggeflokke: Hey Towelliee long time viewer on youtube here :) was wondering what the addon that changes the health bar on ur teammates (including urself) is called? thanks! :)
[6:41:25] fistco: Kind of like this was planned to get more ppl involved in pvp.
[6:41:25] akia03: with pnly 550 conquesyt a week would take weeks
[6:41:28] katsou07: #wrath
[6:41:29] Sollice: So they need to course correct like ASAP
[6:41:30] Lantern214: tHEY WOULD HAVE TO MAKE SERIOUS CONQUEST CHANGES
[6:41:34] Elswango: if they make it upgradable with conquest they should make it so you buy it at appropriate level compared to your rating
[6:41:34] Storm1854: i think valor and badges both
[6:41:36] Lantern214: opps caps
[6:41:40] smashwow: @diathi123 that's kinda the point
[6:41:53] gidgeet: So why do we have to pvp for pve gear lol I am sure the pvpers don't like it
[6:41:54] fistco: They're usually wrong. That's the problem.
[6:41:56] lanara233: @smashwow I agree
[6:42:00] Captain_nShaneO: they can tie it in with the story with the lich king
[6:42:12] NexLap: the lack of PVP and PVE dps tuning right now is driving me nuts
[6:42:13] akia03: @smashwow seasons dont last that long tho
[6:42:16] Sollice: @Towelliee Is it really so bad for them to add like 1 or 2 more drops to raid bosses and add one more piece of loot to m+. It seems like there is a very easy short term thing they can do while they work on a long term solution
[6:42:20] fistco: Who wants to grind pvp for pve content? Fuck that.
[6:42:29] xxCameleon77xx: What is game time token selling for now?
[6:42:33] SSD511_: I’m playing since shadowlands start and my il 210 a friend of mine he just playing arena for 3 weeks he has 220 il 4Head
[6:42:34] leshiltv: Yea, I've farmed heroic CN so much and gear doesn't drop...35 anima per boss...If they want to stick me at 214 until next tier since I can't pug my way to 2100, then I'm out ngl
[6:42:36] Choderz: It wouldnt be so bad except for the fact that soooo many top tier players have 5+ pieces of gear from pvp. Ive always been a firm believer that they should be seperate
[6:42:45] Xailen: they might be hoping to hold of till Classic BC to decide on anything major to change with retail
[6:42:46] Captain_nShaneO: i think you got a 207 piece for that +14, right? that instantly killed my motivation to ever do higher keys
[6:42:47] NILLme: upgrading gear in MOP felt really nice and satisfying
[6:42:47] Choderz: Weaken pvp gear and bring back resilence
[6:42:48] CritcobainTV: 117 right now
[6:42:49] Sollice: 117k yesterday
[6:42:52] Masqerader: nah, any valor system they put in with currency will be stupid overtuned and convoluted
[6:42:58] xxCameleon77xx: Ty all

[6:43:36] Odinzen_: Illidan frozen
[6:43:46] mwchaos: def not the answer
[6:43:47] casualboomer: Don't nerf PvP, buff PvE
[6:43:52] mwchaos: ^
[6:43:54] Thoreya: ^
[6:43:56] howitser105: versatility is resilience
[6:43:58] oggeflokke: Hey Towelliee what is the addon called that changes the health bar on ur teammates? ur setup looks so clean :3
[6:43:58] CritcobainTV: ^
[6:44:03] Kriven: better yet click towelliee amazon link and search for viper mini
[6:44:05] NILLme: versa gear + the pvp trinkets bonus is a great pvp "fix"
[6:44:06] gidgeet: I agree
[6:44:09] Storm1854: Leave BRITNEY errr PVP Alone!
[6:44:09] NexLap: as a havov DH i hate pvp atm
[6:44:11] smashwow: @diathi123 agreed but that doesn't mean it has to be 550 pts to upgrade. they could reduce that keeping in mind timings etc. seasons are about 13-20 weeks so there's a way to handle that.
[6:44:15] mwchaos: make pve gearing as good as pvp lol
[6:44:18] Jaygeh: pve vendor
[6:44:20] mwchaos: pvp they really did get that right
[6:44:20] fistco: Yeah, up raid drops.
[6:44:27] Thoreya: like fuckin forever ago
[6:44:27] mwchaos: 100% agree
[6:44:28] smashwow: don't nerf pvp buff pve
[6:44:35] Mindcloud: Give justice and valor points. Remove drops from m+. Make it so a 20 - can upgrade to 226. 15 220 10 213 5 200
[6:44:36] warrenny: Just getting into pvp dont screw me cos we get less loot in raid
[6:44:42] Thomakos_Gr: i loved legion pvp!
[6:44:48] fistco: Anytime blizzard gets an idea to change shit, they usually fuck it up.
[6:44:52] fistco: If it ain't broke...
[6:44:53] NILLme: they should add more pvp bonuses to the pvp trinket set, like reduced crit dmg etc
[6:44:55] wildwittra: i think a "badge"-system that make it possible to buy a specific item every ~20 M+ dungeon. some currency that increases with M+ level
[6:44:57] Choderz: Its not shitting on it imo. Keep it the same but make it so Pve and Pvp gear are truely viable in their own environment
[6:45:01] Sollice: I think they need to add loot asap so it distracts people short term from the train wreck that is torghast
[6:45:02] Gnral: mythic plus not wroth it compare to pvp
[6:45:03] Thoreya: conduits
[6:45:04] MrFlantastic: MrFlantastic subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 6 months! 
[6:45:05] BrutalBlueberry: As an Outlaw Rogue main, it makes me sad that my BIS gear is all the PVP gear.
[6:45:09] OrieleHS: Hot take--slow gearing feels more rewarding.
[6:45:10] Ice_Pseudo: Legendaries
[6:45:11] Dragonsland7: @Towelliee where is this rare located?
[6:45:14] howitser105: Skulker trinket right
[6:45:15] Choderz: Conduits only

[6:45:17] sco_ragix: Yeah not that when 45k hp players stacked with mythic gear coming into Arenas 10k more hp than others.
[6:45:17] mavrikbtw: sub rogue
[6:45:23] Elswango: you can buy conduits for conquest
[6:45:24] mavrikbtw: trinket off shriekwing
[6:45:25] tdpark_: anyone see youtube the MDI video reminder? is that Dr.Jay?
[6:45:25] CritcobainTV: sub rogue likes a couple of the raid trinkets
[6:45:28] Masqerader: Doesn't matter what they do for pve gearing, it won't be implemented till next patch, will probably be april, by that time it might be too late for some.
[6:45:29] NILLme: its too slow and rng
[6:45:31] fistco: Slow gearing blows.
[6:45:33] Captain_nShaneO: if they added a vendor for PVE at the same ilevel as pvp, why would pve people raid?
[6:45:39] CDubTheRIPper: especially if you want to gear your other spec/alts
[6:45:41] kimmo_gaming: @Towelliee They can get conduits from the Maw, Ven'Nari
[6:45:41] Daggerstry: But people wanted a more Classic experience!
[6:45:42] reffan: havent gotten gear from anything but vault for weeks
[6:45:43] BrutalBlueberry: Slow gearing feels good if you're new to WoW. Lol. Not after 16 years.
[6:45:43] Wulfgrym: this isn't slow gearing
[6:45:46] thebakeriscomingforu: this is retail....not classic. Don't have time for that noise.
[6:45:46] Xailen: loot in classic is better than retail!
[6:45:50] mwchaos: there needs to be a balance, gear being the grind is good, but the scarcity in loot is the major problem
[6:45:51] Wulfgrym: this is doing high difficulty content for nothing
[6:45:53] NexLap: rewarding would be working towoards something.. but it's just rng
[6:45:53] xxKrayzie: even a fucking casual wants gear accept that^^
[6:45:54] redtemplar88: Timing a 6 and getting 35 anima makes me not want to do keys.
[6:45:54] Raxxiety: then just pvp
[6:45:55] mwchaos: and the quality of gearing is shit atm
[6:45:57] mwchaos: for pve
[6:45:58] NILLme: got 1 ring from 14 mythic bosses and it was a downgrade. fk that
[6:46:04] Venasmat: I basically get 1 geared per week thanks to 15 M+ great vault, how is that rewarding ?
[6:46:12] warrenny: Too far in the right direction @towelliee
[6:46:21] Eldood1000: classic style gearing is the best and will forever be the best. its so rewarding when u receive loot.
[6:46:23] padrav: what really sucks is the people who cant get weapons and are forced to wait weeks to get a weapon and then cant get a 220 because htey cant reach 1800 its rough
[6:46:23] mwchaos: facts
[6:46:26] BrutalBlueberry: I cleared Normal Castle in one shot, and got not a single piece of gear.
[6:46:32] kaur_q: how is playing the game suffering?
[6:46:38] bicchiaki: always sucks to spend 3 hours in raid and get nothing but anima and then another person gets hella loot they can't even trade lmao
[6:46:39] CritcobainTV: its your fault 😡
[6:46:39] Thoreya: i feel like pvers do also shit on pvpers tho
[6:46:39] vulraneforot: i love logging into this game for 12 hours a day spamming m+ and gaining no ilvl due to the fact of shit rng OR people fail the key and we get even less loot
[6:46:40] Wulfgrym: blizzard likes to chop off a leg everytime, this time they cut off the pve leg
[6:46:41] Thoreya: lmao
[6:46:43] BaldirCrowseyes: Towelliee telling the truth right now.
[6:46:44] Masqerader: i did bunch of 10s on my alt rogue last week, i got nothing lol
[6:46:48] SSD511_: I’m so bad at pvp lol I’m ok if they balance the pve gear
[6:46:49] Affiiance: I just want you guys to enjoy both sides of the game like me
[6:46:52] Senaries: preach !
[6:46:54] peinen: testify
[6:46:59] Artivicii: true
[6:47:00] CritcobainTV: CmonBruh
[6:47:01] Choderz: Heres the thing with the gearing system. We now have a bis list. So we would still have to farm for that without warforging. So even if they increased the loot drops we would still have to farm roughly the same amount. So yes. They need to make more shit drop. Even if its the shit you dont want. Just feels so unrewarding
[6:47:01] Thoreya: are we sure m+ is more popular than pvp?
[6:47:02] Captain_nShaneO: cutting the nose to spite the face
[6:47:03] DeanoTV: trueeee
[6:47:16] Shieldzy: pvp is a blast this xpack too... quick ques... easy gear... M+ needs a vendor... same pvp system for pve you nailed it bro
[6:47:17] Choderz: Pve is 100% more popular than pvp
[6:47:18] WoW_StandalonE: the current pve gearing is fine, just you are comparing it to pvp now
[6:47:20] NexLap: i've had to pvp on my DH tank, to just get gear at 213
[6:47:22] Kinghorn: before this expansion 100% @Thoreya
[6:47:23] oompaaloomppa: so salty lol
[6:47:28] leshiltv: Well if Blizz doesn't fix this soon for PVE, numbers are gonna talk and big brother Activision will let them know next quarter.
[6:47:29] ManneehFresh: just coppy conquest system to m+. problem solved
[6:47:33] Shieldzy: they should hire you but you dont want to take a pay cut t haha
[6:47:34] Kinghorn: pvp is more popular now because it gives gear
[6:47:43] gidgeet: they got bored lol
[6:47:47] kaur_q: the pvp is only good right now because the casuals are queueing
[6:48:03] Waspire: p[eace out ...
[6:48:06] finneeyy: TOWELLIEEEEEE wassup
[6:48:08] Thoreya: when the changes comin doe
[6:48:14] fistco: Blizzard: If we slow gear down, people will stay subbed longer for that gear.
[6:48:15] Todmeister9000: how do you know they are making changes?
[6:48:15] mwchaos: SOON tm
[6:48:17] Thomakos_Gr: what they change
[6:48:19] Seerated: Yup, they dps'ed the left leg too much this time, making the boss go round and round in one spot. Not right, should've be straight forward/balanced
[6:48:20] Wulfgrym: Towelliee is right and things needs to be fixed
[6:48:21] nocturnal_2195: !mission
[6:48:21] Moobot: Mission Table addon - https://www.townlong-yak.com/addons/venture-plan
[6:48:22] Venkxx: the path is flawed!! :D
[6:48:23] Artivicii: yah most of my guildies are gassing out
[6:48:23] casualboomer: There's a balance to everything in MMOs. Blizz has proven historically they don't know how to balance shit
[6:48:24] parlangua89: @kaurq but thats cause they have too
[6:48:24] massyyxd: they are making gear changes ?
[6:48:25] Captain_nShaneO: @Fistulingus ding ding
[6:48:29] Kriven: damn RIP Hank Aaron
[6:48:30] SavageCheez: #CHANGES
[6:48:33] lumaday: feels worse every day they dont fix it
[6:48:34] Thoreya: i hope so for pvers sake
[6:48:43] Crazdmadman: im waiting for the changes to worse than what we have now
[6:48:47] tdpark_: when he saw those numbers, just fire Ion
[6:48:47] hapsthehamster: they are going to go pay to win method for pve
[6:48:53] warclouds: broi let me get a inv
[6:48:53] Wulfgrym: once he see he can't make a payment on his 10th house off wow profits, hes going to change shit
[6:48:57] hapsthehamster: so for 10$ u can get 226 items
[6:49:05] fistco: It's pretty obvious they're only doing this for monthly sub engagement or whatever fuck hair-brained metrics suits use for 'success.'
[6:49:13] BrutalBlueberry: I mean they could make the vault like the BFA chest. One piece no matter what.
[6:49:15] EpicJune: don't tempt them LUL
[6:49:16] Sinvin: if pve loot is fixed i might come back once im done with PoE but it's just way to frustrating right now
[6:49:16] BaldirCrowseyes: I play for the PvP and chasing pve was always my least favorite part of the process, so I feel you. Its not nice to see it on the other foot.
[6:49:22] NILLme: inb4 they make pvp gearing slower and call it a day LUL
[6:49:24] Provision_: @Fistulingus which will backfire since people leaving for it
[6:49:24] Captain_nShaneO: don't taunt blizzard like that @Towelliee
[6:49:35] smashwow: don't say that.
[6:49:36] byrdeen45: Blizzard oh ya i cant make it worse please hope me beer
[6:49:37] Captain_nShaneO: they'll make it worse on purpose LUL
[6:49:41] smashwow: it could always be worse
[6:49:51] daniel85mg: Renown!
[6:49:53] smashwow: you could lose ilvl everytime you lose a match or wipe
[6:49:55] kaur_q: there is WAY too much pve loot rn. m+ is litterally spamable
[6:49:55] dwolters_the_zombieman: there is a lot of stuff that needs to be fixed
[6:49:56] akia03: when the 6 month subs about to run out they will anounce the fixes and buffs
[6:50:06] SteeeeelReign: bunch of bitches complaining all the time lol
[6:50:06] Captain_nShaneO: @diathi123 that sounds right
[6:50:07] fistco: Make a fun game and people will play it.
[6:50:11] Thoreya: imo if it was as bad as we think at is blizzard wouldve hotfixed the fuck out of it already
[6:50:12] hotdamn1212: its been 8 years since I have played Im having a ton of fun but should i be complaining lol
[6:50:13] mwchaos: spammable for shit gear in the end?
[6:50:15] Thoreya: thats just me
[6:50:19] mwchaos: is that what you mean @kaurq
[6:50:21] ManneehFresh: the fear of falling behind keeps people subbed. they know that
[6:50:22] bicchiaki: ib4 blizzard goes full gaccha game mode :^)
[6:50:23] xrandomdoodx: @Towelliee do we know that sub numbers are really low right now?

[6:50:59] NILLme: they abandoned PVP LUL
[6:51:11] Masqerader: they tried to rush a release it blew up in their face and now they're behind
[6:51:13] dwolters_the_zombieman: there is stuff from other expansions that so broken
[6:51:13] fistco: Fury still sucks.
[6:51:20] hotdamn1212: hey my chaos bolt got buffed too
[6:51:21] BrutalBlueberry: They buffed Assass rogue 8% and it still does 1k less DPS than the other 2 specs LUL
[6:51:24] howitser105: PvP is still a shitshow
[6:51:27] Javasogood: They need to fix brewmaster monks
[6:51:28] the_sleepy1: Havoc got 5% heh and it was crap
[6:51:33] redtemplar88: People still teleporting into Oribos and falling forever. PvE isn't their priority haha

[6:51:51] NexLap: imagine having only 1 dps spec and it being terrible in pve and pvp
[6:51:51] akia03: but with the awc and mdi now they couldnt really do much changes anyway without screwing that up
[6:51:54] Raxxiety: just blame it on the "pandemic"
[6:52:01] Thoreya: bc they specifically said there were no big issues for the team to put out
[6:52:05] Sweaty_Brawls: yep instead of 35 animals you'll now get 40
[6:52:06] kaur_q: @mwchaos the gear is not shit in the universe of pve gear. pve players have no decision making , they just play their style of content and get spoonfed loot.
[6:52:06] Aidler: and here we are defending blizz again like for years... and with us I include me.... sadly
[6:52:13] finneeyy: tuning after AWC maybe ?
[6:52:17] BrutalBlueberry: If this is on track, then damn.
[6:52:17] nuckinfuts617: my level 5 abomb factory fro necro lord costs 15k anima and 70 souls..AFTER levels 2-4 cost 37k anima and 74 souls..that is gonna take so long LOL

[6:52:21] NILLme: falling more and more behind
[6:52:27] mwchaos: 210 loot for a m15 is shit loot @kaurq
[6:52:28] hotdamn1212: that seems to be Blizzard speed tho its not like they are gonna do what POE does if we pay them monthly
[6:52:28] casualboomer: If Blizz is less efficient from home, they're the only tech company in the world that is that way

[6:53:12] lanara233: "As on track as the Titanic" - too soon man, too soon :)
[6:53:19] NILLme: OW died because they wanted to turn it into esport game and slowed down the hero changes... now doing the same with wow

[6:53:41] kaur_q: @mwchaos 1 m+ gets you 210, 1 bg gets you 158
[6:53:43] hotdamn1212: naw need better loot to get in mythics forsure not every class needs a fuck load of vers
[6:53:44] casualboomer: I've geared a second toon to 210 faster than I got one from 211 to 213
[6:53:44] Sweaty_Brawls: real problem is the meta is too good right now and people refuse to break it
[6:53:46] yunggluten: They’re definitely waiting until AWC and MDI are over to make class tuning changes. As far as gear, who knows when they’ll fix that
[6:53:46] Kinghorn: my shaman has been 210, 211 for weeks
[6:53:47] casualboomer: But I don't raid
[6:53:47] Masqerader: I mean when u do a shit ton of 10-15s and you see nothing but 35 anima it is deflating
[6:53:50] br0ther_tim: im 221 with 12 mythic boss kills and 0 loot sadge
[6:53:51] Doomster59: i dont pvp or mythic raiding and im basicly stuck right now FeelsBadMan
[6:53:52] TheCliffyShow: Titanic made millions and became the most earning movie ever. How is that off track?
[6:53:56] Venasmat: Doing mostly high M+ as content, I'm bleeding for a simple loot
[6:53:58] Lexi__Marie: the fact that prot pvp works is still amazing
[6:53:58] bec0o: true
[6:54:10] Gargeth: I'm such a filthy casual, 196. Am I happy with it? Yeah, because I'm not pushing hard to do anything and doing what I want to do at my own pace.
[6:54:22] CADZtv: @TheCliffyShow hes talking about the actually ship my wtf
[6:54:24] kaur_q: it sounds more like you dont enjoy pve than pvp has too much gear
[6:54:30] lanara233: I can give Blizzard a break on some of this stuff. They ARE working from home and gear inflation in BFA was too high.
[6:54:31] CADZtv: @TheCliffyShow actual
[6:54:32] Artivicii: towPog
[6:54:33] Twistid1977: at il200 wwhat lvl keys should i be running as a dh tank
[6:54:42] xXTHEJESTXx: what you mean? I thought I was the only person playing wow! BLIZZARD!?
[6:54:45] Daggerstry: Anyone know how to upgrade the Enfeebled Mark conduit? Mine has been stuck at 171 since day 1
[6:54:46] chrispape: thats me to a tee
[6:54:46] xXTHEJESTXx: jk
[6:54:48] Artivicii: i am little guy BabyRage
[6:54:48] Yagr6: thats the casuals players problem not yours
[6:54:51] BrutalBlueberry: Oh hey thats me LUL
[6:54:51] TheCliffyShow: And some people took my joke series haha.
[6:54:55] SSD511_: Me
[6:55:00] lel3owski: Play more and put more effort into the game if you want gear then.
[6:55:00] FrozenShades: Just fix M+, the 35 anima is just a meme at this point.
[6:55:03] theoriginalzinng: yup im pretty much capped at 207 on my main
[6:55:09] Artivicii: yup
[6:55:10] theoriginalzinng: weekly chest gets an upgrade
[6:55:11] Artivicii: already see it
[6:55:15] Artivicii: then i unsub
[6:55:15] CADZtv: @TheCliffyShow pretty bad joke but ok
[6:55:23] Gnral: its better than bfa pls leave it alone otherwise they gonna change to bfa 2.0
[6:55:24] BrutalBlueberry: I've cleared Nathria twice on Normal... and have not gotten a single piece of gear. GG
[6:55:43] Herandae: I mean, what should they introduce? 210 gear? from what? invalidate most hc gear?
[6:55:44] kaur_q: a pvp players playing 4 hours a week is in 171 gear
[6:55:47] Sweaty_Brawls: at renown level 29 world quest should be giving almost ilvl 200 gear, not a definitive ketchup but might help a few people
[6:55:56] BaldirCrowseyes: The casual pie slice is huge.
[6:55:56] Man_Arising: #notmyblizzard
[6:55:58] TheCliffyShow: Wait, do you mean this game is about more then just me and my enjoyment.
[6:55:59] Aidler: that's what asmon and his people wanted. not devalue older raid tiers. I think it's stupid. nobody want to do the last raid tier
[6:55:59] Cakeabsorber: monkaS
[6:56:02] Masqerader: You got Wildstar
[6:56:10] Hans_Oberlander: sounds finde to me
[6:56:11] hotdamn1212: pretty much forced to get sinful gear hit 1400 just to get your ilvl up for people to add you to mythics
[6:56:12] FrozenShades: Not everyone can invest 12+ hours everyday into this game, no one seems to understand that
[6:56:13] unknownsoldier001: but doesn't adding a catch up mechanic ruin it for the people who have put their time in to be at the top
[6:56:15] Tecni: Id say Dreanor was better
[6:56:17] VBTIGER89: That what some people want it be. They have been saying it for years. Not saying there right.
[6:56:24] Ralvay: stop you are my stepbrother blizzard!
[6:56:27] Venasmat: Man I loved WildStar
[6:56:34] Eldood1000: this is why i dont like retail. too many people want gear handed to them. back in the day if u wanted the best ring u did AV, if u wanted the best healing offhand pre nax, u had to pvp. thats how it should be. if u dont have the time to play the game then dont complain when u don have the gear because ur not playing the game enough
[6:56:37] diln: have you checked in on Rift at all lately?
[6:56:55] Masqerader: you alienate enough people its what it can turn into is more what I mean.
[6:56:59] BrutalBlueberry: @unknownsoldier001 Do you also think making college free means the people who went to college 20 years ago wasted their money? Kappa
[6:57:04] Davidjac: Valor system is really good way to go
[6:57:15] chrispape: facts
[6:57:25] SteeeeelReign: @eldood1000 exactly, it takes away the feeling of having something powerful
[6:57:35] Kinghorn: it is 2021 and 2005 @Eldood1000
[6:57:38] Kinghorn: not*
[6:57:39] howitser105: they can start by giving me a sanctum seperate Hearthstone...
[6:57:41] Gnral: @Eldood1000 true
[6:57:49] PokerFaceMoose: costs a ton of anima too
[6:57:50] TiredCarcass: nothing lol
[6:57:51] unknownsoldier001: @BrutalBlueberry touche
[6:58:02] theoriginalzinng: 184 is stupid... daily emmisaries used to at least give normal raid ilvl loot

[6:58:09] lel3owski: They are casual. They should stay at 200.
[6:58:10] dwolters_the_zombieman: transmog isn't real transmog either
[6:58:13] Provision_: World quest giving less ilvl than story item update is very weird
[6:58:15] kaur_q: sounds like you just dont enjoy pve
[6:58:21] SteeeeelReign: get in a guild, run mythic 6 at least and learn pvp. not gonna come easy
[6:58:24] bertooso: YEP
[6:58:26] CardinalTX: @Towelliee Im the casual player......probably never get past ilvl 190-200 The game has a path for gear, its just a past i cant commit to. thats on me not the game. If i get to a point where i dont progress and get bored. will move on
[6:58:27] gryn: @kaurq are you fucking dumb LOL
[6:58:27] Masqerader: and they murdered timewalking ilvl LOL
[6:58:27] lanara233: I think Nobbel also said bring back Valor tokens
[6:58:31] Masqerader: like wtf
[6:58:32] SteeeeelReign: bunch of casuals
[6:58:32] iEntropius: Preach!
[6:58:44] bmi86: @Towelliee the fact is peaple like shiny things. and the should never have changed that
[6:58:45] Skobble: @Towelliee one of my friends left for exactly this reason
[6:58:45] kokochris: @Eldood1000 that sounds cool and all. Hate to tell ya, when that causes half the population to leave; It directly translates to cash flow for the game. Which will negatively effect the hardcore crowd in terms of R&D budget for future features, plans and expacs. It's a game, but also a business.
[6:58:46] kaur_q: casual pvp players have a WAY harder time gearing up
[6:58:46] mrpresbaby: one of our tanks just quit because of it. among other things.
[6:58:50] KinggKebab: So we should just hand out gear to people that don't want to put in effort? They do 1 mythic key a week so they should be rewarded gear because they want to go farm battle pets instead?
[6:58:50] FrozenShades: This game would be nothing without pvp
[6:58:51] bertooso: i don't play this game on my free time to ghet cucked for playing the game!
[6:58:53] reffan: who are these stingy mfs in chat?
[6:58:55] duhworks: pve is fine its just not rewarding
[6:58:56] unknownsoldier001: need more ways to make anima, the daily quests dont give any. at the moment its just world quests or running daily dungeon
[6:59:00] Artivicii: all i do is high m+, im so behind still
[6:59:17] XuremGaming: Blizzard: fun detected, must nerf
[6:59:24] howitser105: they did leave it alone for that one week tho
[6:59:27] Artivicii: leave brittany aloneee BabyRage
[6:59:27] EpicJune: KEKW
[6:59:28] Djaygam3s: I might be the the unpopular opinion but I loved Wotlk, cap justice, cap valor, rinse and repeat
[6:59:33] CADZtv: KEKW
[6:59:33] TSquadSully: LUL
[6:59:37] synathos: LUL
[6:59:40] Wulfgrym: @Towelliee what the actual fuck is wrong with these people today?
[6:59:43] reffan: if its not rewarding it will die
[6:59:45] Attackroot: i only play about 3-5 hours a week and im ilvl 200 on my dk tank. mainly getting +6's done each week. and pvping. and im not complaining about my gear cause im still on par with my friends that play more...
[6:59:47] casualboomer: If I got my main and one alt to 220, all I'd log on to do would be callings for raw gold farm
[6:59:51] xxKrayzie: classic loot andys
[6:59:56] BaldirCrowseyes: If the basic gameplay loop is boring and unprofitable, there is a major design flaw.
[6:59:57] vulraneforot: me and my friends have been spamming 10's for weeks, but the ones who need the loot arent getting it
[6:59:58] thebakeriscomingforu: @Djaygam3s totally agreed.
[7:00:14] Senaries: dude i had to buy some mythic items from AH and still not on the level of pvp geared people
[7:00:16] dwolters_the_zombieman: timewalking dungeons don't even get you gear to do lfr
[7:00:21] SteeeeelReign: yea the raid is one thing that does need to change
[7:00:24] TiredCarcass: play about 20 hours a week and one raid night. Im been stuck around 200.
[7:00:24] griffdog125: its like jerking it with no outcome lol
[7:00:24] kaur_q: you are comparing hardcore pvp to casual pve
[7:00:25] ManneehFresh: i hit a wall once i broke 200 ilvl
[7:00:27] vulraneforot: it's taken me 3 weeks to get a new weapon AND i wasnt evn the one to fucking loot it
[7:00:29] snoo_32: i think most casuals will go play random bgs and farm conquest. That is why blizzard put all the high gear in PvP, to give casuals something to do right ?
[7:00:30] duhworks: I mean like raids are good dungeons are good its the system of allocating loot that's very bad
[7:00:30] ShinyLox: Even worse when that gear is shit and it doesnt help or its lateral to what they already had
[7:00:31] reffan: three weeks for me :P
[7:00:32] br0ther_tim: 3 weeks of 4mythic boss clears no loot here
[7:00:32] Yagr6: ok bring back titanforging LUL
[7:00:34] nuckinfuts617: one piece of gear with the WORST stats on it KEKW
[7:00:35] HoppsiDejsi: 2 weeks??? i got the same item 3 weeks in a row?
[7:00:36] Eldood1000: @SteeeeelReign yes, exactly this. imagine spending an entire raid tier farming a weapon with the correct ILV, just for a new player to receive that ILV weapon during the next tier because of catch up mechanics. that ruins the entire aspect of the game and makes it pointless to even play the game. might as well play the very last tier of the game and get thebest gear...
[7:00:37] Provision_: @Attackroot you prove the problem, they can't get better items even tho they play more because of bad drop systems
[7:00:40] redtemplar88: I don't think people understand what "catch up" gear means. No one is asking to be 226 as a casual. People just want to progress their ilvl.
[7:00:43] Mecksta: Yeah I finally got a piece of gear from nathria after doing it for 3 weeks @Towelliee
[7:00:43] Lyranec: whats that song? :o i missed the name :x
[7:00:43] gryn: I literally had to wait 4 weeks for a weapon @Towelliee , mind you I heroic raid every week and do 10-14s for my vault
[7:00:44] Sweaty_Brawls: The badge system single-handedly saved kharazan back in BC, once you could get 20 plus badges out of it per week it brought life back to the rain and people were able to catch up
[7:00:51] Choderz: Ya i like it, but like you said, they made it waaaay to slow
[7:00:54] mayhemguy: I LOVED REFORGING
[7:00:56] casualboomer: Reforging should have never left
[7:00:57] Choderz: reforging ./drool
[7:01:01] Senaries: LOVE REFORGIN
[7:01:03] xxKrayzie: the hour you play you should get rewarded^^ not a week later^^
[7:01:05] Doomster59: got 1 piece of relevant gear on my main in the past 2 weeks, while doing 15 m+ keys a week. yea really fun kekW
[7:01:06] flyingmachin3: the best is when you do the raid and you get the same piece week after week and you dont get an upgrade
[7:01:09] Aidler: loved MOP
[7:01:10] Scoodles91: no idea why they removed it, it was cool
[7:01:11] Bradwarden27: Havent gotten a single item from CN except for trinkets that i dont even use in pvp
[7:01:13] Attackroot: @Provision_ but we dont do any raids at all.
[7:01:15] flyingmachin3: xymo ring reeeeee
[7:01:20] filipinojflo: Do you think because we got gear so easily in BFA that it seems lack luster now in SL
[7:01:23] L4dy_Renegade: Reforging was awesome.
[7:01:23] narcotica007: tbh i am super super casual only do lfr and some heroic dungeons i personally am happy with the gearing system atm. 188 but i can imagine if you put way more time in then me and you struggle to upgrade your gear it sucks
[7:01:24] Masqerader: I also think badge/valor system won't really help, people aren't gonna wanna grind another currency that Blizzard will take you take 2 weeks to be relevant to use especially given anima bs
[7:01:24] hapsthehamster: @Towelliee you know why they dont bring reforging back because you could make some insane built with it
[7:01:25] Choderz: how could you hate it ???
[7:01:25] lanara233: What's the ideal gear rate, one piece a week? Two pieces?
[7:01:26] Odinzen_: or you get the same pair of pants 4 weeks in a row from raid and you have had better ones from pvp the whole time @Towelliee
[7:01:30] Moobot: Calm the spam, @Fistulingus (warning)
[7:01:30] Xailen: I dont even get excited when I get an upgrade, I hate it more than not getting it.
[7:01:31] Artivicii: i could do without reforging
[7:01:33] Wildside1177: Same people who got rid of the whistle.
[7:01:37] dreadthefate: reforging was changing secondary stats right?
[7:01:42] hotdamn1212: as a old player what brought me back was the level squish lol
[7:01:45] lel3owski: some content creator probably made a video, just like they did for the "loot pinata" problem, wanting less gear to drop and the mob picked up on it and complained
[7:01:45] reffan: reforging was addon run in the end, it was, push this button to do it for you
[7:01:46] hapsthehamster: I loved it but man running at hardcap haste
[7:01:47] Choderz: Make a shitty piece better??? Na get that shit outta here lol
[7:01:47] AntistarD7: You run your RBGs this week yet? :o
[7:01:51] Sephiroht: Sephiroht subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 106 months, currently on a 106 month streak! 106 towHAMUP
[7:01:53] Provision_: @Attackroot yeah and good luck getting 200+ ilvl stuff without raiding, it a gamble and you wont progress
[7:01:56] theoriginalzinng: blizzard night crew things
[7:01:59] necralia: yeah im mad about the wsistle
[7:02:06] Captain_nShaneO: i miss it so much
[7:02:08] shimwood: The whistle goes woooooo!
[7:02:11] Storm1854: they need the whistle, and you also need... MORE MAILBOXES IN ORIBOS
[7:02:16] FrozenShades: They probably wanted people to explore all the zones and see them before implementing more transporation systems @Towelliee
[7:02:17] Eldood1000: @kokochris do u remember when wow had 10-13 million subscribers during tbc/wotlk and then rapidly declined when they introduced catch up mechanics and lfr? i do, it was a terrible decision. if u dont have the time to devote urself to get sought after gear and complete end game content then dont complain when u can only play 4 hours a week and want gear handed to u
[7:02:20] gryn: Another thing that sucks as well @Towelliee is these 4Head mythic+ sellers arre suckering these desperate people that NEED gear
[7:02:20] CardinalTX: If ZoS would ever fix ESO performance my wow sub would be done
[7:02:22] pemadsen17: would reforging be a suitable cocompromise
[7:02:27] Choderz: @Sephiroht damn homie! props to you!
[7:02:32] Beybiblical: Also players who would've spent anima on it will feel hard done by
[7:02:33] robertjordan83: @Towelliee transport systme is only one zone tho right?
[7:02:34] bennythejet_ne: Are you feeling like 14s are feeling pretty easy with your gear as a prot pally? I am 209 as prot and 13s don’t seem too bad this week
[7:02:36] ghostjugg: transport gonna be worthless soon as flying comes out
[7:02:37] casualboomer: Not useless at all. I can teleport straight to two dungeons
[7:02:53] Sephiroht: @Choderz towHype
[7:02:58] lel3owski: we are around
[7:03:04] Wildside1177: The FTPs got a lot better.
[7:03:09] Crazdmadman: I dont miss the whistle, the zones are so small it wouldnt save much time
[7:03:09] redtemplar88: Took the words out of my mouth Towel.
[7:03:11] lanara233: Transport is WAY faster than flying :)
[7:03:23] CADZtv: wow also was the shit to stream to back then
[7:03:26] dwolters_the_zombieman: the problem the transport from covenants doesn't get you to safe spot
[7:03:29] thebakeriscomingforu: uh....TBC and Wotlk also had badge vendors to buy gear in addition to plenty of gear drops from dungeons and raids.
[7:03:36] thebakeriscomingforu: Crafting was also not bad
[7:03:39] shimwood: Transport will still be useful for getting to Oribos, doubt they'd let you fly between zones
[7:03:44] necralia: LUL LUL LUL
[7:03:44] CDubTheRIPper: danD
[7:03:44] kokochris: @Eldood1000 ive been around since release; and was an Asherons Call player in 99. Ive seen it man. We are not in the same time right now in the industry.
[7:03:49] theoriginalzinng: rofl
[7:03:50] t0pgun_: LUL
[7:03:51] TSquadSully: KEKW
[7:04:03] Putcride: ultima?
[7:04:04] EpicJune: Flyff KEKW
[7:04:07] SteeeeelReign: the venthyr hearthstone, I wanted it to be its own thing separate from the reg hearth
[7:04:07] Gnral: or eat our digital ass PixelBob
[7:04:08] Yagr6: yea ESO is free now
[7:04:12] Attackroot: @Provision_ ive played long enough the gear will come when it comes. im not hardcore nor care to be. im always able to play and be on par wiht people with out raiding. hell most the 213 ive gotten has been dps gear so it sits in my bags.
[7:04:15] BrutalBlueberry: Warhammer Online was dope af. But was terribly optimized for most PCs
[7:04:19] ImProGrG: ESO
[7:04:28] NILLme: tbc gonna save the day
[7:04:34] fistco: lol
[7:04:42] xXTHEJESTXx: TRUE
[7:04:45] L4dy_Renegade: We're all addicted.
[7:04:47] Kriven: IMO free to play is more harmful to mmo's than it is helpful now we are stuck in this item shop hell for most mmos
[7:04:47] Magnarius: warhammer was great but YOU HAD to foillow the cuurve or you were out and it killed the game and blizzard is dooing it right now with the loot system
[7:04:48] Sandman_88: = /
[7:04:54] epiczplz: wow pwns nothing compares imo
[7:04:57] Eldood1000: @kokochris oh yeah im aware, ive been playing since pre ZG during vanilla.
[7:05:00] CADZtv: faxxx
[7:05:00] Provision_: @Attackroot and that the issue, there no way getting above 213 without mythic raiding etc, which minority of the game does
[7:05:03] Masqerader: wrath content outside raiding, go do dailies till u get enough argent seals to buy a mount oh the funs!
[7:05:11] Njels95: ESO only has 700K players. Its still not up there
[7:05:21] Thoreya: wow needs some new big thing in 10.0
[7:05:30] Aidler: yeah so far Ions expansions are not the best
[7:05:31] Thoreya: i do think m+ and pvp get stale for a lot of players
[7:05:36] Gnral: bfa 1.8 million and sl right now is about 2.5 plus million
[7:05:43] Thoreya: and its gonna be a bigger issue as time goes on
[7:05:53] Yagr6: mayb 2 options at the vault would help?? or 1 from each branch of content you do? @Towelliee
[7:05:59] DestroyerDa007: Swotor exists as long as the game has at least 200k subs. EA said this a while ago. So we know they have at least 200k min
[7:06:08] BrutalBlueberry: "Only 110k" WHAT
[7:06:14] EasyPeasley: Yeah with Tokens I haven't spent money on WoW in years
[7:06:18] casualboomer: 2500g per day per toon. Do it on 5 toons, and you never have to spend a dime
[7:06:19] Captain_nShaneO: :/
[7:06:20] CDubTheRIPper: i mean if you do your calling everyday thats hallf of your sub LUL
[7:06:25] CDubTheRIPper: plus alts
[7:06:26] Thoreya: remember legion tokens were 220k
[7:06:28] Thoreya: goodtimes
[7:06:32] TiredCarcass: grab beer
[7:06:33] katsou07: if you do your calling quests every day each month u will have enough gold to make it free to play thats why theres so much gray gold items from callings quests
[7:06:36] Eldood1000: the current wow landscape is fine i guess given people want instant gratification. the younger generation is to thank for that. but i just dislike that their is no immersion anymore. with instant portals, etc. no more flying or walking when u can join a que and teleport to the dungeon, raid, etc
[7:06:36] k0nvick_: Ion ruined the game because he has played with the same people for the last 15 years and doesn’t understand the actual player base and how they play the game. Ion is detrimental to wow and it shows with more and more every expansion
[7:06:49] Thoreya: wod was so bad they stopped giving us sub numbers
[7:06:50] Tezzeret88: Oh shit youre a golden knights fan?
[7:06:51] Thoreya: so i dont wanna hear it
[7:06:54] CADZtv: @Gnral good made up numbers KEKW
[7:06:55] hotdamn1212: what exp was that lol
[7:06:55] TiredCarcass: beer makes friday better
[7:06:58] westsidewow: ashran lel
[7:07:00] Crazdmadman: "grab another beer" is a great philosophy
[7:07:03] bennythejet_ne: Why was wod so bad
[7:07:05] ShinyLox: I was surprised that WoW came back after WoD
[7:07:10] MaleFrom73: I pvp'd the shit out of WoD. Liked it
[7:07:12] Putcride: Wod was bad only one new raid foor an entire year
[7:07:14] Foglatch: @oOtterz agreed, Ion is a clown
[7:07:16] Leokyn: towBeer towBeer towBeer towBeer
[7:07:16] Provision_: @Eldood1000 the rewards is the issue, not the path to get it... you can do 70 mythics and get 0 progression...
[7:07:19] Gnral: its true , i dot make up things
[7:07:21] Thoreya: ion was in charge of legion, bfa, and shadowlands
[7:07:23] Thoreya: not THAT bad
[7:07:35] lanara233: Did Bellular do some kind of calculation on BFA subs?
[7:07:37] Blah206: Didn't Chilton help Legion ?
[7:07:38] DestroyerDa007: tbh id love to be playing wow right now but blizzard aint accepting my money so im here : p
[7:07:43] jerseyfive: a lot of people got fired for wod... i mean they "retired"
[7:07:43] hotdamn1212: I quit when they changed shards on my warlock back in WOTK
[7:07:51] PokerFaceMoose: 1. addiction is real 2. wow has framed expectations for MMOs for a ton of players. No game can match the way you felt 10 or 15 years ago experiencing something unlike what you had ever experienced before
[7:07:53] ScytaleTv: LOL Eld is basically a grandfather from the 1950's. "Well back in my day... blah blah"
[7:07:59] Aidler: @Thoreya legion was already finished when he took over. technicaly it's not his expansion
[7:07:59] Moobot: towGreen Shadowlands Limited Edition TOWELLIEE covenant shirts AND Towelliee hats are LIVE! check them out HERE! | Dbh.la/towelliee towBlue
[7:08:05] kokochris: @Eldood1000 I can agree with you on one thing. I never liked flying either. Made the world seem too small
[7:08:21] Yagr6: WoD= take away m+ and the vault and covenants, the maw, torgast
[7:08:24] Eldood1000: @Provision_ yeah...thats fine. thats how it was in vanilla/tbc. drop rates were a thing...u worked for it and it felt good. u would go weeks and maybe months without seeing that 1 piece of loot that u need.
[7:08:29] Dynglars: legion was not a good expansion
[7:08:34] Thoreya: yes it was
[7:08:40] Foglatch: the sooner Ion is removed, the sooner the healing can begin
[7:08:43] Blah206: Tom Chilton was still the lead on Legion
[7:08:46] Dynglars: not it was pretty bad tbh
[7:08:51] Blah206: so just BFA and SL
[7:08:52] Thoreya: u guys do understand before ion was in charge we had WoD
[7:08:54] CardinalTX: I like flying.....but dont miss it......the whistle though....FFS blizz atleast the whistle
[7:08:58] Aidler: all together legion was a very good expansion
[7:09:07] lel3owski: @Eldood1000 funny thing is, content creators were saying that is what they wanted and the mob were saying they wanted less "meaningful" loot for shadowlands
[7:09:09] k0nvick_: If ion never figured out cthun being mathematically unkillable and blizz ended up giving him a job we would be in a better place rn 😫
[7:09:12] TheCliffyShow: This new back transmog I got from Forgemaster actually matches the opportunist set I've been using for a while.
[7:09:20] jason_tacey: @Dynglars and let me guess you loved WoD?
[7:09:22] lel3owski: @Eldood1000 now they cry and just want free loot for doing nothing
[7:09:25] Provision_: @Eldood1000 Issue is, that one piece back then did A LOT, now you need more than 1 piece to get there and it all RNG
[7:09:29] DestroyerDa007: I miss legion dungeons. With the exception of cath so much fun
[7:09:44] Yagr6: the only thing wod had going for it was the legendary ring i think that came at the end and the spec specific trinkets from last raid
[7:09:45] Blah206: Legion is probably my favorite expansion, esp out of the recent ones. I played Legion for soooo long. The patches, the story, the mage tower. MM gameplay. I was in heaven.
[7:09:45] Dynglars: @jason_tacey no I dident but early legion was really bad, compared to early bfa, legion was worse
[7:09:46] Aidler: @Thoreya that's true but that doesn't make Ion a good game director
[7:09:58] ScytaleTv: @Eldood1000 dude you have a rather rose colored view of BC.. I can remember the massive complaints of your beloved work hard for loot idea.
[7:10:11] lel3owski: bullshit
[7:10:21] lel3owski: hardly anyone was complaining like they do now in BC
[7:10:24] NewWorldReign: is that ony sleeping in th background?
[7:10:24] Thoreya: @Aidler hes not perfect but i dont think people understand how bad it was prior to him
[7:10:27] lel3owski: not all of us were 5 like you during BC
[7:10:34] Blah206: lol
[7:10:35] hotdamn1212: BC was the best at the end I bet it will have old ass patch for ever right?
[7:10:51] Gnral: 2.5 million different account did mythic pls and raid(not counting alts) + 2.7 million account reached level 60 so 2.5 million ¬ subs
[7:10:56] Eldood1000: @Provision_ gear did a lot back then because u didnt have talent enhancing abilities like in todays xpacs.that changes everything
[7:10:57] Foglatch: wrath was the pinnacle, before they listened to the hardcore sweatlords and made Cata
[7:10:57] Aidler: @Thoreya yeah WoD was bad but legion and Mop were great
[7:11:18] Thoreya: i didnt play MoP feelsbad
[7:11:23] Thoreya: was a freshman in college
[7:11:28] Provision_: @lel3owski yeah and we are now what 10 years later? The gaming industry changed, games haver died (eg. wildstar) because they wanted to go that "grind for gear" path
[7:11:40] NewWorldReign: Cata was the tip of th iceberg then it sank like Titanic with WOD
[7:11:40] lel3owski: @Provision_ duh
[7:11:55] Thoreya: i quit in cata
[7:11:57] radicalmon: PUPPERS
[7:11:59] Thoreya: fucking hated that expansion lol
[7:12:11] Eldood1000: @ScytaleTv i mean, ive leveld countless times on vanilla private servers and geared up every single time the same way. on classic i dont even have rejuv gem yet a year later and a half later. im not complaining about it at all. thats just how i think the game should be played.
[7:12:15] Foglatch: at least 10 of my friends quit in cata and never came back
[7:12:20] lanara233: I quit in Cata too. Even the trailer felt more trashy than usual.
[7:12:25] pemadsen17: @towelliee do you think reintroducing reforging in combination with some kind of badge or valor system would be a suitable solution to the pve gearing issues shadowlands is currently experiencing?

[7:14:14] jason_tacey: I miss Slootie
[7:14:19] Arwenack: Just completed the level 60 mission table for a mount with a Night Fae alt using level 36 characters, meanwhile my Venthyr main can't complete missions for meat at the same level. What a joke!
[7:14:20] Eldood1000: @ScytaleTv i remember on swtor there was a title/achievement that took about a year to complete. people complained about it and then they reduced the time it took to complete. which is a giant slap in the face to the ones who took the time to farm it the real way.
[7:14:24] Thoreya: i feel like mad streamers are takin it easy this month
[7:14:24] Masqerader: nope he didn't

[7:16:00] Masqerader: that shit is like 1.39 for 10

[7:18:31] Eldood1000: @ScytaleTv oh yeah i know. i havent played since bfa. the loot system were terrible. i dont like the fact that someone could get a titanforge thats much higher than mythic raiding by just doing heroic. that type of loot system isnt good for the game. im not sure if its fixed now but i may play shadowlands
[7:18:40] Aidler: I'm sure they wait with all the new and fresh content till blizzcon online towLul

[7:21:35] Eldood1000: @ScytaleTv another thing was the loot box system they introduced in legion which was really stupid. getting a high level arcano crystal for example
[7:21:43] NewWorldReign: Blizzard has their own Twitch channel right?
[7:21:43] FrozenShades: When is Blizzard's next big game? Thats what id like to know. OW was the last one however many years ago

[7:22:09] DeanieMan: I want a release year for Diablo IV. All I want this year. :D
[7:22:09] BrutalBlueberry: Blizz's PR is not great currently with the tournament stuff, the China drama, etc. Im sure theyre going to try to bank on current fans, instead of something new.
[7:22:17] danimoto10: arthas in the maw t-shirts
[7:22:49] SpamTheChat: have they shut the servers off for HoTs yet? LUL

[7:23:41] DeanieMan: Starcraft: Immortal. "What? You don't have mobile phones?"
[7:23:45] TheCliffyShow: If Blizzard wants to make mad bank they need to make Lost Vikings 2.
[7:23:52] CursedVenom: maybe a update to the netflix shows?
[7:24:04] LilChiliMPH: What's the list on the left above the camera?
[7:24:07] BrutalBlueberry: HOTS has become like Starcraft. People still play it super hardcore, but the average player has forgotten it.
[7:24:11] Eldood1000: @ScytaleTv i quit as soon as panda launched lmao. i couldnt handle the whole furry xpac haha
[7:24:17] porowozek: fuck them, community tounaments are great now
[7:24:18] RogueBear: 2015 was SC2: Legacy of the Void. i think an SC3 release would be phat. i just dont know if theres more story to tell there

[7:56:10] tdpark_: anyone know if monk is the lowest HP tank ?
[7:56:46] Fortune90: @MrGattz vers is just big over all for bear, i believe. cant go wrong with a stat that increases your dmg done and decreases your dmg taken
