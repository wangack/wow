[0:23:20] awesomeraff: or i guess you can
[0:23:22] Hoshma46: @mibbiix you dont know the brick? WTFF
[0:23:25] dubiusdingus: so relatable
[0:23:30] ShaggySummers: People have to actually know and understand you know. It's the worst. @Maximum
[0:23:33] SillySmiffy: That is how I feel about my Dad. Everything he wants he just buys himself.
[0:23:35] SurfSalsa: dawg
[0:23:36] DanteDemonZ: @nesia2 HUH
[0:23:40] Voso505: The more money you have the better the sentimental gifts get
[0:23:41] The_Fuzzler: can i still get that shirt? and do they make them in adult sizes? Kappa
[0:23:42] larkhill: this is why food is always the best gift
[0:23:42] FrankDaGreat: its thoughtful
[0:23:46] eazye503: i would get someone a subscription to hello fresh as a gift i think
[0:23:47] AnarchyMoose: AnarchyMoose subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 8 months! im gonna get you a "dog dad" couch
[0:23:47] xdanielsooon: @Maximum Gift should be something the person wants but would never get for themselves
[0:23:49] DanteDemonZ: Suki? like the character from avatar the last airbender?
[0:23:54] mibbiix: @Hoshma46 Again... W h o ? I don't know some brick
[0:23:55] hogbruhh: @nesia2 xdd
[0:23:56] OG_Kawngi: YEP socks
[0:23:57] The_Mail_Man__: @DanteDemonZ yea
[0:24:04] Regroot_Gaming: Would u feel sad if someone gift you a pair of socks? some ppl does
[0:24:05] spivet: that is kinda the thing that happens when you get old even if you arent rich. Anything you want that isnt practical to buy for yourself is probably too extravagant as a gift anyway
[0:24:06] xdanielsooon: like you cant just go buy a dog dad hat @Maximum
[0:24:20] nkeleidyn: I get that feedback too. my wife just goes to Etsy and searches for video game or music stuff
[0:24:31] eazye503: “man the avatar movie owns”
[0:24:34] SillySmiffy: The easiest way to piss people off is to call anime cartoons.
[0:24:35] DanteDemonZ: oh boy
[0:24:37] logicaltty: KEKW
[0:24:38] The_Mail_Man__: did you guys see that one piece show? heard its brand new
[0:24:44] bexyttv: you think any of the TW guilds will catch up to you and echo?
[0:24:46] Dungeon47: lol
[0:24:48] Woeloen: @The_Mail_Man__ R)
[0:24:52] The_Mail_Man__: @Woeloen R)
[0:24:56] eazye503: “this brand new show avatar is amazing - what a novel idea! “
[0:24:56] Regroot_Gaming: Didn't you just do that about the Dune movie
[0:24:58] Rhop: But the new Avatar live action is kinda alright
[0:25:00] AJ_TPanda: @Regroot_Gaming if people gift me underwear or socks I'm happy af. I need more but never remember to get more
[0:25:00] dreadPack: Same for manga->anime
[0:25:00] kakebuts: I hope they make a cartoon rendition of the netflix show, "one piece"
[0:25:04] Nailez: i disagree a tree is not made of wood, change my mind..... mindset
[0:25:07] thiccsushi: baseg
[0:25:07] m1lkman10: Max can I cook on a few ideas for you to make chat go crazy?
[0:25:09] JackOfAllApocalypses: Imagine carrying about anime
[0:25:18] Dynomight01: frag out
[0:25:20] JackOfAllApocalypses: Caring*
[0:25:22] The_Mail_Man__: garf
[0:25:26] thiccsushi: garf
[0:25:28] m1lkman10: Some casting is good, some is not
[0:25:30] Hurbob14: same. always the problem with child actors
[0:25:30] spivet: always the danger when you have child actors
[0:25:38] Hurbob14: @spivet BRRRRRRUH
[0:25:40] Terryn90: I think the acting was ok with like half of the characters
[0:25:42] AnarchyMoose: i heard the acting is fine, its the dialog thats terrible
[0:25:44] AlmightyWitchDoctor: roleplay what? whats BDG
[0:25:47] clazuls: i feel like the acting is intended to be a bit cheesy to match the anime
[0:25:49] REAPER_Replicator: its oke, but some changes i did not like, but its a oke serie
[0:25:54] Pyrrha_GG: it is very alright, writing is meh, seems like they did it just to do it, doesn't feel like it has vision
[0:25:56] Terryn90: uncle iroh hard bangs
[0:25:59] Qtpants92: Once you get to episode 4 it gets super 👌
[0:26:00] Kurrbs: honestly a season 2 would be better theyre all pretty young
[0:26:00] BlazinHurricane: I hate laugh tracks, find them distracting
[0:26:01] MxiTTV: Did BDG quit?
[0:26:03] MrTheDude1519: The original SAW movie is really difficult to go back to
[0:26:14] Mrwobblez: iroh and zuko hard carry the netflix version
[0:26:20] Regroot_Gaming: Just like the Friends show , unwatchable
[0:26:26] Boreall: Max it was because he stubbed his toe right before Season 2 started filming
[0:26:38] NDRandell: What happened to BDG?
[0:26:39] AlmightyWitchDoctor: who is BDG rip bdg? rest in piece?
[0:26:42] codingbs: Frasier is unironically goated
[0:26:47] OG_Kawngi: CAUGHT
[0:26:48] Coriollis: they missed on the tone of the original but idk everyone wants to make their mark
[0:26:49] HeyDeMuu: expanse is super sick though
[0:26:50] Rhop: I'd say it's like, the most 7/10 adaptation of a 10/10 show.
[0:26:50] zolito5: im from quebec and i cant watch anything in french because of the voices in the translations. it triggers me so much
[0:26:50] Blut103: BDG o7
[0:26:50] ShaggySummers: they dispensed
[0:26:54] AlmightyWitchDoctor: OH Big dumb gaming
[0:26:54] Kobaaya: R.I.P
[0:26:54] MxiTTV: Man that's sad
[0:26:56] aar_xd: u gonna pick up any bdg players?
[0:26:58] shallis124: o7
[0:27:06] buffkenobi: live action BDG was WAYYYY better @Maximum
[0:27:06] AnarchyMoose: jb said bdg quitting was a long time coming
[0:27:06] yuhhhhe: @Maximum can you show the bdg announcement?
[0:27:10] nathkin: I binged the shit out of for all mankind, finished it in 2 weeks
[0:27:10] AJ_TPanda: Hot take: One Piece live action was better than the anime
[0:27:16] Kurrbs: oh yeah its #1 in like 70+ countries
[0:27:26] m1lkman10: I think theres a ton of fans who were gonna hate it no mateter the quality
[0:27:28] Codester_remix: Show was a solid 7-8/10 imo Not the best but higher then mid
[0:27:28] Coriollis: one piece lasted for a lot of weeks cuz word of the mouth , curious about avatar
[0:27:30] Ultratide_: @nathkin 2 weeks isnt really a binge
[0:27:39] soupfuel: @AJ_TPanda, this is bait
[0:27:46] Upsidedownsmiling: @Maximum your looking fast and not fat today :)
[0:27:47] numnumss: I think the voice lines in the new avatar are pretty bad but the effects are way better than i expect by a mile
[0:27:52] Oskarmage: Oskarmage subscribed with Prime. 
[0:27:59] Aro725: gotta be hard when every tier 3 ppl leave to better guilds
[0:28:14] thiccsushi: CAUGHT
[0:29:08] Niconatelver: rip bdg :c
[0:29:23] jirouaa: what is bdg?
[0:29:33] zolito5: now bdg players are going to other top 10 guilds, makes them better
[0:29:34] AJ_TPanda: @soupfuel tbf I don't like the anime at all, so wasn't a high bar to beat lol
[0:29:56] AnarchyMoose: so youre saying "they played themselves"
[0:30:00] Taytor: I mean how much of your roster over the last 3 to 5 tiers was BDG players
[0:30:20] TiPera: !wallpaper
[0:30:35] TyHeals: @maximum who we snagging from BDG
[0:30:53] PhungusTV: do you think the same result is kind of inevitable for method?
[0:30:54] TiPera: does any1 know his wallpaper guys?
[0:30:56] Rhop: They've basically been in maintenance mode/on life support for awhile now
[0:30:59] forgotwhyimhere: sloot said the same thing - that he was surprised it didnt happen sooner
[0:31:01] Dungeon47: @Maximum (or chat) I feel like Hero Talents are just more numbers, procs and button bloat. Feels like soulbinds/conduits all over again. You seem to like them. What am I missing?
[0:31:02] Regroot_Gaming: Read the document , they explained why they kept pushing
[0:31:03] eazye503: recruitment emails have been sent to brick guy im sure
[0:31:08] Boreall: Max isn't it pretty selfish to say that, since BDG raiding this tier got us the brick?
[0:31:13] nephuhlim: nah
[0:31:21] Hemenia: Method can actually pay their players tho
[0:31:23] Klutch81: It's just super unfortunate it's always a 2 horse race
[0:31:32] Niconatelver: Echo & Liquid having monopol on most rwf players?
[0:31:43] thenateo2: @Klutch81 better than 1 horse race
[0:31:51] nalegi07: tobo dawg
[0:32:00] heckles: Always gonna be hard.... as Echo or yourselves will pick up all the outstanding players from the other top guilds
[0:32:00] Oracle_WoW: isnt method much closer to 2nd place than bdg ever was?
[0:32:01] niddociv: nope
[0:32:01] DayOldBeef: Am I the only one who doesn't mind the 2 horse race, we are in the olympics out here
[0:32:02] scharkweek: no
[0:32:03] Goatsguffle: Whats up with BDG?
[0:32:06] scharkweek: aint noway
[0:32:08] spivet: 5 years is a while, a lot can happen
[0:32:09] AmenRamen: Those aree the best kind of bets
[0:32:14] Niconatelver: @Goatsguffle disband
[0:32:27] itsmagyks: I wouldn't be surprised if Method beats Echo or Liquid in the next few years.
[0:32:28] AnarchyMoose: i think method will surprise everyone one tier, and thats it. just one tier
[0:32:31] x_Scy: method has some giga top tier talent players, just less requirements than echo afaik
[0:32:31] thiccsushi: Method could get a dark horse win within 5 years
[0:32:34] AmenRamen: Covid19 didnt exist 5 years ago
[0:32:35] tolarianweave: did you hear tobo left echo?
[0:32:38] Therealbrokensword: 5 years is what, 5 races? I think they could compete by then
[0:32:43] nephuhlim: i think method is looking at the race as more of a content thing then competitive thing by paying attention to the vibes
[0:32:56] Dzor12: @Therealbrokensword 2 races per year on average
[0:33:01] LuciFeariUm: 5 years is probably 7-9 races
[0:33:08] larkhill: i think theres going to be an unexpectedly easy raid that ID comes close to winning
[0:33:14] Feartuskk: 2
[0:33:14] logicaltty: no
[0:33:16] Patrikhg: 3 per 2 years or so
[0:33:24] Madgeneto: @AmenRamen so what?
[0:33:25] kelly_mac06: yes
[0:33:26] mycho_: yea all within a year
[0:33:26] Zaisx: 3 raids in the first year of DF
[0:33:26] jussihenrikm: What if rouge get new spec "Jackal" and your special talents are Dog
[0:33:27] Woeloen: yes
[0:33:27] logicaltty: oh, then yeah
[0:33:27] just_ie: I mean 3 patches, but 2 races in 2023
[0:33:27] sedael: 3 in 12 months but not calendar year
[0:33:28] Kurrbs: every 6 months
[0:33:31] kelly_mac06: November May November
[0:33:32] Taytor: december 2023, jun 2023 nov 2023
[0:33:35] Taytor: dec 2022*
[0:33:43] Therealbrokensword: actually yeah they have indicated a bigger cadence with the new expacs
[0:33:43] Pyrrha_GG: i find it unlikely unless all the good players that method needs just don't leave, they could probably be a dark horse in a couple years if they don't lose those people (and can recruit better or on par with E and L)
[0:33:49] syzurup: max, you ever think about life after WoW? if that exists?
[0:33:58] AmenRamen: @Madgeneto Its just like, difficult to conceptualize how long ago that was.
[0:34:06] astraltertugubb_: isn't BDG similar to Fatshark yes in regards to a less intense schedule?
[0:34:09] mab_music_ttrpg: they confirmed it ? 18 month expac ?
[0:34:10] kelly_mac06: @Taytor abberus was may
[0:34:11] thiccsushi: 4 raids again PauseChamp
[0:34:16] ctg_dreamz: @syzurup lmao he's just going to fade into dust as soon as WoW ends or something
[0:34:17] logicaltty: how sure are we that they're committing to 3 raids instead of cutting it to 2
[0:34:19] tanker27: @Maximum Did you get the new Swiftpoint mouse yet?
[0:34:24] Nailez: i would also argue burnout due to back to back races personally @Maximum
[0:34:29] Ok_Kingston: If theyre going faster the last 2 bosses can't take 3 months for the avg CE guild
[0:34:31] Grimm303: ai is for sure going to way increase speed to iterate new content
[0:34:31] Oracle_WoW: WF race in sod about to end.
[0:34:39] Therealbrokensword: the concern is will it be only 2 raids and a fated season?
[0:34:40] itsgamz: making expansions with a deadline is universally a bad idea
[0:34:42] i_Static: !mouse
[0:34:46] Riot_Blacktimus: if we get 3-tier expansions every 18 months it averages 2 raids/year and should be a more consistent schedule
[0:34:48] Woeloen: @Maximum would be insane if the quality does not drop
[0:34:48] Harleybane: @Maximum would you prefer more raids but less bosses or current template? thinking in terms of finding a place to stream race and everything
[0:35:12] P_O_B_A: @Maximum wait so what happened to bdg?
[0:35:13] Dungeon47: @itsgamz Agree. Chasing this faster expansion thing for almost 20 years. Just make them good and no one will care.
[0:35:25] zolito5: instant dollars fucking slam for their hours
[0:35:29] itsmagyks: The gap between Method and BDG currently is larger than the gap between the top 2 and Method

[0:38:40] thiccsushi: o7 󠀀
[0:38:41] jjwallababy: o7
[0:38:50] The_Mail_Man__: @SillySmiffy yea it would be hard
[0:39:16] flabstv: my guild is the  best guild at wiping
[0:39:20] Clush___: bla
[0:39:21] Zaisx: they were 3 nights a week, maybe 4?

[0:39:37] insom_0h: what happen to bdg i just got home
[0:39:44] 1renegadesasquatch: Do you think with all the guilds disbanding will lead to smaller raid sizes for the majority of players?
[0:40:00] larkhill: @insom_0h disbanding as a RWF guild
[0:40:00] tinyelephant__: @cucumbertoessniffa its largely seems to be pointed at themselves.
[0:40:03] east_8: Sadge
[0:40:08] thiccsushi: o7

[0:41:13] Taytor: yeah
[0:41:15] ItsToxicQT: o7

[0:41:25] Diazanite: some of the european players went to method after gg backed out
[0:41:26] ggEarth: A lot of our EU players went there after us yeah
[0:41:33] The_Mail_Man__: cayna would probably be the expert on it

[0:42:40] LuciFeariUm: right?
[0:42:44] The_Mail_Man__: @wulfgang71 overworking/loss of passion
[0:42:48] xdanielsooon: Myth was from BDGG too
[0:42:50] shameshady: is this the team sloot played for ?

[0:44:07] Ademi_tv: rip bdg :(
[0:44:09] zolito5: wasnt bubba their raid leader or something?
[0:44:19] isFeyz: I used to be in a guild that was 2nd/3rd depending on the tier and our top players were constantly poached by the number 1 guild, and it was difficult to say no to them and they only lured people with server firsts achievements and a top <50 ranking.
[0:44:19] nephuhlim: if you're paying players why not have a contract
[0:44:22] Plan: the AAA guild for top 3 rwf guilds

[0:45:19] TeamLiquid: Looking to take your gameplay to the next level? Learning a new class and would like some pointers? Head on over to our discord go.adv.gg/6tAoHx to schedule a coaching session with your favorite Team Liquid raider!
[0:45:24] niddociv: if you were in their position as GM, what would you do to keep people/officers around? @Maximum

[0:45:59] tinyelephant__: yep
[0:46:03] Rampo123: CAUGHT paying for air CAUGHT

[0:47:23] punkyeti: time for salary cap
[0:47:28] Ruinx81: Need someone to pump big money into a new team…for little return
[0:48:02] KaisenSiru: anniesRIP
[0:48:04] Diazanite: the only way for any org to come in and try to dethrone echo or liquid, you would have to invest as much or more money than the top two for a longer period of time, and its still only a small chance to work out at a profit
[0:48:06] fleks27: sponsor lose into roster issues into 8 month break is just ff

[0:50:25] DraftyyTV: given how transparent the game can be now, I would love to see an additional RWF every tier that rewards 2-3 night guilds. Kind of like Break the Meta for m+
[0:50:25] DreadfuryDK: It required nearly 230 kills for Leandros to charge up his boner.
[0:50:26] Gongstream: :bricked:up:

[0:52:13] DreadfuryDK: I'll probably get flamed for this (and deservedly so) but I feel like the writing was on the wall for BDG this tier and that it was pretty blatantly obvious even while they were progging on Tindral that the guild was gonna die after this tier.
[0:52:23] TwoCentBullet: fuck tindral
[0:52:33] imdonexd: @thalesz1 theres a censored clip somewhere but the OG clip and vod got taken down for TOS lol

[1:15:13] HealsAndThat: I'm so torn, I'd tell you to take the deal within a nano second. But I would also be pissed at more ads.
[1:15:14] Woood: i dont mind adds, as long as they arent 3min at a time lol
[1:15:19] Line_0: i hate that you are right
[1:15:21] Dillsmof: They play too many at once
[1:15:23] larkhill: they even reminded people turbo exists
[1:15:23] Spartanate: I look at ads as a time for me to get up and get water or use the toilet
[1:15:25] Basic_3: So long as you always do the good part of your stream during your ads, I'm happy
[1:15:34] Deathlorrdd: Turbo is goated

[1:15:44] m1lkman10: Ads are never bad until you experience the platform with no ads, and going back isnt an option
[1:15:45] Jarlan23: i still fucking hate ads i go through hoops to get an ad blocker that works
[1:15:45] DunzoCD: plus turbo gives streamers money like you watched the ad
[1:15:46] Drax_1224: 3 subs now but ya
[1:15:46] Fracke: Turbo is a must, cant watch twitch without it
[1:15:46] Ionized4: slightly more now
[1:15:47] afraidreality: turbo actually goated
[1:15:47] Line_0: think turbo loses them money in a way
[1:15:47] ItsANoBrainer: 3 subs

[1:16:00] UnheardGrace: ads on twitch are so garbage, I hate that they cut into the stream time. I'm literally missing out on stuff to listen to actors try to sell me insurance
[1:16:00] Aryxa: @Maximum it's 11.99. so more than 2 less than 3 subs
[1:16:04] Ok_Kingston: Turbo is the bomb. Still worth. No adge ever
[1:16:05] zerossussy: used to be 7%
[1:16:05] Drax_1224: turbo bis if u watch 3+ streamers regularly
[1:16:06] drewsky96: do you think twitch could get away with canning turbo?
[1:16:06] xultance: stolen laptop, neighbors wifi, parent's house
[1:16:07] zerossussy: 7$*
[1:16:07] axetomouthh: i WATCH TOO MANY STREAMERS TO NOT HAVE TURBO
[1:16:08] sauron644: Is there a better player in the world than firedup?
[1:16:09] Peeachy0: ive never seen ads as a bad thing cause i only watch people i like and then i sub lol
[1:16:10] spivet: they started pushing turbo a little bit more, I get little pop ups about it sometimes when watching streams im not subbed to
[1:16:14] gandalf_wow: I’m surprised they didn’t downsize to SDG first
[1:16:15] Swyvle: @axetomouthh preach
[1:16:15] JarRulez: literally a turbo button next to your profile picture
[1:16:16] samaxis: Turbo is great I sub to like 3 people I like and just watch add free on the rest of the site
[1:16:17] sanatalive: turbos makes primes useless
[1:16:17] Diazanite: but also its hard for advertisers to want to advertise on a platform that is telling you to buy this sub to not see ads
[1:16:18] bigoldmeatpie: they increased the price but didn't increase the value
[1:16:18] migliqt: didnt babombadam come from BDG
[1:16:19] kags158: turbo is goated

[1:16:34] AkuTVgg: turbo gang
[1:16:34] Krepo: for small streamers, if they get gifted subs (with vpn to cheap country) they actually lose money cause no ads
[1:16:36] gandalf_wow: Amazon prime you pay $3 with no ad
[1:16:39] itsmagyks: If you're watching twitch without turbo you're either trolling
[1:16:43] OG_Kawngi: Madge ads?!
[1:16:43] itsmagyks: or dont know about it
[1:16:47] HealsAndThat: I am pettty as all fuck, I will write personal filters and dig around the internet for hours to make Ublock work

[1:16:58] syko_totem: I hate ads, and I can afford turbo. Watching different streamers, must have
[1:16:58] bangsk33t: I cant remember what an ad looks like, Ive had turbo so long and will never go back

[1:17:04] StarShopping95: YEP
[1:17:05] cucumbertoessniffa: seeing ads on prime video makes me rage
[1:17:07] SVT_Dexter: I'll be at someone's house and a youtube ad comes on and I get confused
[1:17:08] dingusbingus7: I dont think anyone likes to see ads
[1:17:12] Oorvik1: it’s 10x worse with content not designed with ads in mind too
[1:17:14] Netphics: just subscribe to the adblocker lol
[1:17:15] tanker27: @maximum did you get the new swiftpoint?

[1:17:25] berchberkins: i house sat for someone and constantly had to watch ads on their tv it was pain
[1:17:26] koak___: @KDaily you're trolling right
[1:17:29] Ok_Kingston: I've never been closer to domestic violence
[1:17:29] Diazanite: the only reason i dont get yt premium is because its way too expensive for the shit i would use
[1:17:30] astraltertugubb_: playing ads on already subscribed customers is double dipping and fucked up
[1:17:30] Clush___: docLeave
[1:17:41] spivet: youtube premium has one feature I dont like which is that it tells you how many watch hours youve had since you started it. Did not need to know how big that number is
[1:17:42] vaerlyn: Calling anyone for this?
[1:17:45] chubbytheboi: @gandalf_wow You don't, they touch you
[1:17:54] pnguinwow: you have the name one still?

[1:18:30] Plague_GG: scalecommander is so good
[1:18:47] Maxotaur: hey chat, if i catalyst an item with speed on it, do i keep the speed on the tier it creates?
[1:18:58] Kyrianel: Good interaction
[1:18:59] BLACKFOOT_TN: Hero Talents should be Passive. And add ZERO fucking buttons.
[1:19:07] schiavetto: added complexity so the game doesn't feel bland
[1:19:11] Pyrrha_GG: rets feelin gooooood
[1:19:14] oleolel: rat paladin

[1:19:35] Pyrrha_GG: can confirm ret feelin good
[1:19:35] Regroot_Gaming: Are they not gonna add more points into the regular talent beside the hero talents?
[1:19:36] Basic_3: Hero Talents are because they couldn't add new rows to the bottom of the tree.
[1:19:36] baseboned: wow players are brain poisoned
[1:19:43] chubbytheboi: @Maxotaur it turns into coke instead
[1:19:44] spivet: its also a way to add talents but without messing up the balance of the existing tree
[1:19:46] antipheonixna: @BLACKFOOT_TN depends you can't add buttons currently to like ww or enhance but you easily can to like ret or dps warrior
[1:19:54] namedaccount: Dark ranger is super fun! we get a button that does nothing
[1:19:57] Jjmn12: @yiannisjk holy Chatting
[1:20:03] lixtix: just remove the talent part of it and it’s fine, it is not talents
[1:20:03] Beff_Jridges: and you can swap whenever you want...i really am not understanding the hate
[1:20:03] RowanWeir: @yiannisjk or sometimes people like an idea you don't, oh my god dude
[1:20:10] BLACKFOOT_TN: @antipheonixna I said ZERO sir.
[1:20:21] Scoops__: what is that
[1:20:24] chubbytheboi: Best pie chart I've seen
[1:20:32] Jazzarus_: photoshop or paint EZ
[1:20:35] gwenmh: they also dont have to go back and redo all the current talents because they weren't designed to have like 5 extra points in them

[1:21:08] chubbytheboi: I like Rogue's hero talents. Make them press more buttons. Make them suffer
[1:21:16] cixelp: you should make a fronk tier list
[1:21:29] cixelp: just a tier list but put fronk in it
[1:21:29] Do0dy93: @Maximum Are the ones that we have seen fully confirmed or have Blizz stated they will still modify them until full release?
[1:21:40] relimee0: just look up wow hero talent tiermaker on google YEP
[1:21:45] cucumbertoessniffa: wouldnt your immediate response be to put fronk in s tier?
[1:21:46] cixelp: to show how fronk compares to fronk
[1:21:49] dreadPack: Swamp, bad, mid, good, ddd
[1:21:51] fleks27: you said every guild has some and i quote "bitches" - so liquid bitch tier list?
[1:21:53] Basic_3: @Do0dy93 It's a video game. They can modify anything. They already put Oracle back in the oven.
[1:21:53] gandalf_wow: max Venmo me $10 I’ll give you content ideas
[1:22:01] BLACKFOOT_TN: @antipheonixna You are talking CLASS reworks. Adding buttons through HERO talents is shit design. And no Warriors don't need more buttons. They BETTER buttons. Not MORE.
[1:22:06] chubbytheboi: @Do0dy93 Alpha isn't even out yet. I HOPE they listen to us and make changes

[1:23:57] antipheonixna: @BLACKFOOT_TN i get the sentiment but this is probably the best time to ever create a sub class or new playstyle in your spec every, maybe since legion. Could be expanded over these 3 expansions. But yeah u can still have ways to enhance current versions and thematics like elune chosen for boomie basically being their current build

[1:30:56] fleks27: frostfire s doesnt need a point even GIGACHAD
[1:30:58] Pyrrha_GG: so funny that oracle was pre swamp tier
[1:31:02] LazerBeemz: crazy how hyped people were for Dark Ranger and how absolute ass it turned out to be
[1:31:09] classicvcr: Did BDG Disband?
[1:31:10] OG_Kawngi: I need Archon to be a heater
[1:31:11] Emiltharia: This would be good Dratnos content but homie is away from pc fucking casual
[1:31:14] DeafConcreteGuy: hey! long time watcher and been gone for a minute - but I like egg rolls and hamster wheels

[1:31:19] Regroot_Gaming: Meh..
[1:31:22] Madcatmk02: @LazerBeemz i dunno i think it still seems fun to play just not as thematic
[1:31:23] Basic_3: "Nice personality"
[1:31:24] danielyost: WTFF not DDDD
[1:31:25] bubbles105: No hope
[1:31:26] Byrdomir: requesting Really Bad just be Dogwater
[1:31:28] gwenmh: needs god
[1:31:30] BLACKFOOT_TN: Make them cat tiers. So the PoddyC makes more sense.
[1:31:33] SirPikajew: Below really bad is whatever windwalker is tied to
[1:31:33] punkyeti: swamp ass or riot
[1:31:34] Scoops__: need cool right
[1:31:34] Opsage_Gaming: Needs work
[1:31:40] Sweepstakes86: turbo meh?
[1:31:42] sethron: needs work
[1:31:44] Line_0: @just_ie its a nice evening
[1:31:44] Nuclear__Moose: @just_ie Night air can be super refreshing ^^
[1:31:46] Entenstein_: need a trickster tier
[1:31:55] stalababy: KINDA BAD = MID
[1:31:56] stalababy: hahaaha
[1:32:01] TwoCentBullet: bring back swamp ass
[1:32:04] jjwallababy: I am going to rageyboom when he gets to lightsmith
[1:32:05] pinkbox: mid = bad
[1:32:05] just_ie: DEEP DICK DOLLY DUMPSTER?
[1:32:06] BigBigu: @Maximum  you should look at Teapot stream, new Challenge Mode boss is out and it's real tough
[1:32:08] antipheonixna: include boring cause wildstalker and dk are kinda just boring
[1:32:15] T3DOR: Trickster should be it's own category below swamp ass
[1:32:23] Swyvle: ^
[1:32:28] Jazzarus_: no SWAMP tier is a blasphemy
[1:32:29] Clush___: i like trickster honestly
[1:32:33] DasBull_XD: ^
[1:32:37] BLACKFOOT_TN: Dr Dratty Dolly Donger Dratnos tier?
[1:32:41] antipheonixna: they need to change feint on trickster to like gouge
[1:32:47] zerossussy: @Clush___ trickster feint will be op but its really bad
[1:32:51] McScooterson: cough lightsmith cough
[1:32:55] Line_0: really bad = redo asap
[1:32:56] zerossussy: having perma 20% dr is insane
[1:32:57] zerossussy: but
[1:33:00] LazerBeemz: @Madcatmk02 the last thing BM needs right now is more procs of barbed shot, not to mention bwailing arrow could be turned into what black arrow is with one new talent
[1:33:01] zerossussy: its really dogshit man
[1:33:05] f_tier: bdg disbanded or wot i miss??
[1:33:06] Clush___: @zerossussy why it soudns fine to me
[1:33:13] Benjg7: sanlayn needs a rework
[1:33:27] Regroot_Gaming: Just read it real quick
[1:33:37] antipheonixna: its wildstalker level real boring
[1:33:41] Zaisx: too much in one CD
[1:33:41] Basic_3: How are druids fucking around with trees not a good theme?
[1:33:47] VirKatJol: VirKatJol subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 25 months, currently on a 2 month streak! <3
[1:33:50] NotD4k: mid
[1:33:57] chubbytheboi: san'layn is trash
[1:33:58] Florqt: I don't agree that keeper misses on theme, malfurion was making tree homies like crazy in wc3
[1:33:59] zerossussy: @Clush___ u will have to press it very often, i dont think pressing feint is that ideal, im fine with it and i dont mind it, i just think the killing spree part should be removed/deleted because that talent is so bad to play (not talking about powerwise)
[1:34:01] spivet: KOTG theme is a win for warcraft 3 enjoyers
[1:34:04] dreadPack: Balance druids hate this
[1:34:10] Line_0: gameplay and synergy seems alright, but trees arent too exciting
[1:34:11] thiccsushi: As a boomie I hate this one
[1:34:17] antipheonixna: should be mushrooms for boomkin
[1:34:24] Khorvan: As a resto druid I also hate this one
[1:34:26] Omochrome: As a boomie i like it
[1:34:28] Clush___: @zerossussy whats the difference in hitting feint very often or hitting sinister strike very often, its just a button brother
[1:34:36] Omochrome: Gives me furion vibes :)
[1:34:37] dreadPack: Nahhhh
[1:34:50] relimee0: whiole
[1:34:56] Regroot_Gaming: Trees are cool , idk u what u mean , lots of ppl like trees :/\
[1:35:03] Basic_3: @Clush___ Hitting Feint is better because it makes you an unkillable god
[1:35:04] YezakGai: Bdg disband?
[1:35:05] dreadPack: Noooo
[1:35:05] zerossussy: @Clush___ as i said feint is whatever, killing spree part is complete washed up, same with the mastery part
[1:35:06] blueheron24: i mean as a balance druid i dont mind the theme because trees was originally a balance talent to begin with
[1:35:13] Windnecro: i just want the mists of panda trees back to go with keeper, the wrath spamming trees were cool @Maximum
[1:35:25] NotD4k: pet classes Bedge
[1:35:26] chubbytheboi: @Clush___ exactly. make them press more buttons. fk rogues
[1:35:27] Swyvle: @Clush___ because it means they will have to nerf feint or else we just never die to anything
[1:35:30] dreadPack: Enforces a bad build+dump style. Trees are hard bad
[1:35:43] NotD4k: baseg

[1:35:52] ShaggySummers: Healers GoodTake
[1:35:52] astraltertugubb_: FeelsBadMan
[1:35:53] Lothland: Resto don't like it in raids
[1:35:53] menzlo: It's not great for resto either
[1:35:53] T1TANZ_78: I hate trees
[1:35:53] Fracke: Fuck the trees
[1:35:53] LuciFeariUm: we dont like the trees
[1:35:53] antipheonixna: change like 2-3 nodes to also do something with mushrooms or make trees place mushrooms too and its banging imo
[1:35:54] dango0n: dango0n subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 11 months! can we get a balatro Jokers tier list @Maximum ?
[1:35:54] Skyfall715: trees suck
[1:35:55] Madcatmk02: this theme slaps imo
[1:35:57] menzlo: Pet class bad
[1:35:58] cabita31: btw healers ignored its no only on this channel
[1:35:59] CoffeeASAP: treees suck
[1:35:59] zerossussy: get growl Pog
[1:36:00] DraftyyTV: yea pet healing stinks
[1:36:01] Clush___: @Swyvle are you saying they are going to have to nerf the 40% aoe reducting on a 15 sec cooldown (effected by outlaw cdr)? oh no.. anyway
[1:36:01] syzurup: i dont want to cast regrowth on myself
[1:36:01] Khorvan: healing with pets feels awful
[1:36:04] LuciFeariUm: the trees are ass for heals rn
[1:36:04] Skyfall715: no one wants to be a pet healer
[1:36:06] scottydoof: trees not fun button to press
[1:36:06] q_u_v_p: M+ it feels great but raid it sucks
[1:36:06] whatsupwithnick: i hate S3 tier set fo rresto
[1:36:07] Florqt: didn't your app say you knew resto perfectly? you should know if resto likes this
[1:36:07] infraredpen: love trees
[1:36:08] Patrikhg: rng healing
[1:36:09] MoleDude: I don't think I've seen anyway say they like the tree theme playstyle
[1:36:09] SirPikajew: Healers may get dimissed but we hate boomkins more here
[1:36:10] fleks27: started healing for fun, logged of druid because treant cringe
[1:36:11] Vanhyali: I'm a healer and I'm ok with it. It's kinda mid.
[1:36:12] MilkyChaos: i like the r trees on my end, havent looked into the hero talents too much though
[1:36:12] alezedar: I love trees in m+
[1:36:13] tacochan: i love the cute trees
[1:36:14] TheMixedNuts: he hates healers confirmed
[1:36:16] FuruF: Ask JB
[1:36:19] dreadPack: Can we get tettles or chicken here?
[1:36:21] Line_0: its well thought out at least so mid fits
[1:36:28] Boomshackz: Call an Healer :)
[1:36:37] Swyvle: @Clush___ yeah and you're still going to have to press it on cd and its still going to feel bad lmal
[1:36:42] Khorvan: the only resto druids who like it only like it because trees are powerful right now, but as a playstyle it sucks
[1:36:52] zerossussy: i dont play druid but i wont like the tree part
[1:36:57] Azzil44: trees are lazy design
[1:36:59] Brannible: but what if it summoned a bunch of baby moonkin instead of trees
[1:37:08] Line_0: this was the many many moons
[1:37:14] dreadPack: Elune's chosen so much better than trees
[1:37:14] Clush___: @Swyvle why is it going to feel bad if it's mandatory in the rotation, which would mean its your highest damage option, which would make it not feel bad... wtf are u saying
[1:37:27] stumie: trickster more like DICKster amirite
[1:37:28] Zaisx: moonfire spam
[1:37:29] Ac1Baddie: @Brannible an army of baby moonkins would be sick af
[1:37:29] swipegodx: no quadruple d or swamp ass is this even a tier list
[1:37:30] antipheonixna: this is the current build turned up
[1:37:32] DrQuackzalver: chicken man make loud noise
[1:37:35] logicaltty: @Clush___ it feels bad to have to use a defensive button for damage instead of as a defensive
[1:37:42] Swyvle: @Clush___ ur lost. it doesnt matter anyways because i bet you all the gold on my account it gets reworked
[1:37:54] chubbytheboi: @Ac1Baddie YES! So we can kill them
[1:38:07] Clush___: @logicaltty ok simply use your brain to change the button from "this is a defensive button" to "this is nowa damage button" dang thats crazy u did it
[1:38:07] crudeshag: ur lost. it doesnt matter anyways because i bet you all the gold on my account it gets reworked
[1:38:08] zerossussy: i feel like dmg amp talents are whatever pre new expansion
[1:38:11] antipheonixna: ur prob gonna cap a lot especially with moons in cds
[1:38:17] antipheonixna: and the random procs of astral
[1:38:26] Phoenixeld: whats going on with BDG?
[1:38:30] punkyeti: no sun, sounds out of balance
[1:38:34] logicaltty: @Clush___ ok, but then you lose a pretty powerful defensive, which sucks
[1:38:35] yuhhhhe: wouldnt the resto balance tree make sense to be full solar related? bc plants need the sun?
[1:38:37] LazerBeemz: @Clush___ except on the same tree they are also buffing the defensive portion of the ability by 10% lol
[1:38:42] cuck_norris__: you should rank all your tier lists at the end of the spec
[1:38:48] Clush___: @logicaltty youre still hitting the button on cd wtf are you even typing on the keyboard
[1:38:49] Brannible: @Ac1Baddie boomy becomes demo warlock, but instead of imps its just a bunch of moonkin
[1:38:51] whatsupwithnick: what the hell is this mcdonalds ad
[1:38:57] Clush___: you still get the defensive benefit lmao
[1:39:15] NotD4k: really cool the defensive is just bad
[1:39:20] logicaltty: @Clush___ if you're pressing it in your rotation then it may not be up when you need it for defense
[1:39:23] Swyvle: its fine we get it clush you need a perma 50% dr to never die
[1:39:24] C4leb0rn: what is this hero stuff?
[1:39:29] menzlo: Thrash talents still work with elunes @maximum ?
[1:39:31] Swyvle: but its still bad gameplay
[1:39:35] dreadPack: Elune's chosen  = really cool, keeper = kinda bad
[1:39:41] Line_0: meh
[1:39:43] Jazzarus_: kinda bad
[1:39:44] Clush___: @logicaltty are you saying you may have to adjust your play for incoming damage events? oh no!
[1:39:49] cuck_norris__: did they release the other two rogues? I missed that
[1:39:50] MarkyMark9191: its kinda bad
[1:40:02] darkeon3: MOAR DOTS
[1:40:11] dreadPack: Wild stalker is like for cat weaving specifically
[1:40:12] jamyynn: this is a catweave tree. all it is tbh
[1:40:12] Ac1Baddie: seems cool for resto and mid for feral
[1:40:14] Line_0: i feel like its not exciting and theme isnt great either
[1:40:23] GuilherMELHOR: @cuck_norris__ no
[1:40:27] antipheonixna: the tree is literally a conduit tree or the netherlight crucible, its a waste of time too boring imo
[1:40:30] Regroot_Gaming: Why there's no mix between feral and balance ? that'd be sick.. fuckin blizzard
[1:40:40] Pure_Melee: @Regroot_Gaming hasnt been shown yet
[1:40:54] Madcatmk02: @Regroot_Gaming because then druids get more hero talent trees than every other class
[1:40:56] IHeartProduce: KOTG for raid, Wildstalker for m+ on resto druid
[1:41:08] Line_0: theme kind of sucks for feral
[1:41:11] chubbytheboi: @logicaltty I admire the persistence in trying to explain something to an obvious troll xD
[1:41:16] daryl_fish: yea but we're not ranking on strength right? This shit sucks
[1:41:19] LOBSTERGOPEENCHPEENCH: dude, JB thinks everything is mid
[1:41:27] Regroot_Gaming: @Pure_Melee obviously druid of the claw is mix between bear and feral , cause bear got 1 mix so far in keeper of the grove
[1:41:34] Khorvan: for resto wildstalker is def 1-2 tiers above keeper fun-wise, but it's still def pretty mid
[1:41:40] Xyletics: It doesn't seem "Windstalker" by just adding another DoT, imo
[1:41:46] NotD4k: bear both cool themes EZ Clap
[1:41:47] dreadPack: You can't put qildstalker in pretty bad and have keeper of the growth in mid
[1:41:48] logicaltty: @chubbytheboi yeah, i thought he was being genuine at first and got myself trapped
[1:41:55] Pure_Melee: @Regroot_Gaming ok
[1:41:55] gubugu: basically the guardian trees are OP and the rest sucks
[1:42:01] ridder30: you have to take jb's propensity to sandbag into play
[1:42:10] Thasin22: wish they could just pair moonkin with resto and bear  with feral.
[1:42:13] Line_0: its forgettable
[1:42:18] dreadPack: Riot! 🤣
[1:43:02] stumie: chronowarden looks nutty for the auggy wauggies
[1:43:13] Line_0: looks good for aug
[1:43:18] Braumance: Are all hero talents out ?
[1:43:22] bayazijr: That hover talent is absurd
[1:43:23] Basic_3: People were just pissy about the defensive hover.
[1:43:32] chubbytheboi: @Thasin22 Well, they wanna do the love triangle (in this case square)
[1:43:38] antipheonixna: this seems like something u have to play to know how bad or good it feels
[1:44:13] Icycutes: very mid
[1:44:19] Thoreya: mid
[1:44:21] Line_0: its alright
[1:44:21] mikejonesrp: bad
[1:44:21] mavell21: mid
[1:44:23] direbeest: mid af
[1:44:26] chubbytheboi: Imo healers are support classes too. They support you by keeping you alive
[1:44:30] vorsmyth: I thought it was cool as Pres
[1:44:31] hogbruhh: It screams mid to me
[1:44:31] zerossussy: idk maybe mid
[1:44:32] NotD4k: scalecommander is just better
[1:44:34] Dberjerak823: epitome of mid
[1:44:34] vorsmyth: not amaizing but sorta cool
[1:44:35] UnheardGrace: keep the warp stuff, tweak the rest
[1:44:36] stumie: definitely mid (I literally don't play evoker ever what do i know)
[1:44:42] ashelfal: blink hover is neat though
[1:44:42] Line_0: Pog mass disintegrate
[1:44:44] C4leb0rn: need a meh option between mid and kinda bad
[1:44:45] Thoreya: scalecommander GIGACHAD
[1:44:52] Do0dy93: i'm not good enough at WoW to make a good opinion of hero talents
[1:44:55] zerossussy: holy shit
[1:45:06] guynormally: Preheat made a vid on this, the synergy w/ your talents is HUGE
[1:45:08] Line_0: its gonna look so cool
[1:45:08] chubbytheboi: Scalecommander sounds insane
[1:45:25] stumie: the scintillation procs are gonna be so fucking sexy
[1:45:27] Oleka: I might boot up my dev evoker next expansion...
[1:45:29] Rafix1301: sad frost dk noises
[1:45:29] SpaEngi: PepegaPhone for devastation, right?
[1:45:38] baseboned: I wasn't paying attention, can someone in chat give me a 10 word version for Wildstalker being kinda bad and not mid
[1:45:43] dango0n: inb4 there are no 3 target raid bosses lol
[1:45:43] stumie: and you can move while using deep breath now!
[1:45:44] UnheardGrace: deep breath being a good cd sounds so fun
[1:45:46] Dsully08: it seems way better for dev than aug
[1:45:53] vaerlyn: what raid encounters actually would allow taking advantage of 3 target dps
[1:45:55] dreadPack: I love deep breath.
[1:45:58] ashelfal: using deep breath in single target has been kinda meh though. Hopefully a big enough buff to make it fun
[1:45:59] Thoreya: @SpaEngi nah this tree is sick for dev
[1:46:00] chubbytheboi: @Rafix1301 DW fellow frost DK brother, we ain't getting any love any time soon
[1:46:03] discomancer1: @baseboned jb said it's mid, if he says it's mid, then it's kinda bad
[1:46:07] guynormally: @baseboned theme is lame, doesn't add fun gameplay
[1:46:08] NiteOwl11617: I think that breath of eons cdr might be weird because of desyncing
[1:46:18] Nuclear__Moose: gonna have like a 40-50sec cd deep breath lol
[1:46:21] Line_0: only with mass disintegrate
[1:46:25] NiteOwl11617: deep breath will probably feel good, because it feels kinda dog rn
[1:46:26] stumie: @Dsully08 scalecommander is definitely just devastation +. Aug's are all gonna be chronowardens for sure
[1:46:43] ridder30: @discomancer1 to add to this, that tree is aimed at someone like JB and if he isnt excited by it that means its kinda bad
[1:46:47] Line_0: yeah its often
[1:46:49] Rafix1301: @chubbytheboi rider of the apocalypse will save the spec hopium
[1:47:00] UnheardGrace: scalecommander aug looks fun, idk what y'all are on about
[1:47:25] Kawjiryu: insane in pvp lol
[1:47:26] Gapplebees1: I think it's awesome
[1:47:32] Luderkarljohn: When is the hero talents?
[1:47:40] hogbruhh: I'm 100% gonna go scalecommander aug lmao
[1:47:40] Thoreya: @Kawjiryu true holy shit lol
[1:47:44] Luderkarljohn: new expansion or s4?
[1:47:48] Bupkus: @Luderkarljohn turn on your monitor bud

[1:47:58] Luderkarljohn: tyty
[1:48:09] NiteOwl11617: Do we think that bombardments will count as black spells?

[1:54:36] MeisterChiefX: wailing arrow synergy wouldve been thematically interesting
[1:54:38] Standy94: If this sims .4% less than the other one no one will play it

[1:54:58] IronboyEuw: @Maximum it reminds me abit of black arrow from old survival
[1:55:03] Bupkus: I think the big problem is it should be Surv not BM
[1:55:03] logain_13: People were sure it would be Surv/Marks and not BM/Marks

[1:55:16] Nico56400: yes
[1:55:16] McScooterson: yeah it being half bm is werid
[1:55:18] kelly_mac06: i dont get why it's BM and MM and not Surv MM
[1:55:23] Kobaaya: hell no its MM core
[1:55:23] kelly_mac06: which would make more sense
[1:55:25] reaperscarl: ye
[1:55:27] Pudzianos: this gives barbed shots instead of kill command so its bad
[1:55:29] stumie: xddShrug surv not getting black arrow is definitely kinda weird
[1:55:30] thiccsushi: Dark Ranger is old SV imo
[1:55:30] Deyndra: it just makes people miss mop survival
[1:55:31] DannyBoii614: think they tied bm into it because wailing arrow was a bow ability from SL
[1:55:32] Line_0: its firing an arrow though
[1:55:34] just_ie: @maximum Dark rangers should look like a 12 minute fight where you stack moonkins over hunters
[1:55:37] Sweepstakes86: old survival is what they're referring to and they want people to use the new surv
[1:55:38] GearzxGaming: @MeisterChiefX most ppl think that, since black arrow was a surv ability if I'm not mistaken
[1:55:38] zerossussy: BatChest
[1:55:39] Pyrrha_GG: Dr. Atnos thinks that
[1:55:40] zerossussy: true

[1:55:41] dogmaster9000: nathanos had 2 dogs :)
[1:55:42] Standy94: Suvival also doesn't shoot
[1:55:42] Madcatmk02: i think ranger also implies ranged where as survival is melee
[1:55:42] tabd69: @MeisterChiefX thats a cap
[1:55:46] reactionsoce: a
[1:55:48] gwenmh: i think the only reason is because people remember old survival having black arrow
[1:55:49] KaisenSiru: I play Survival devoTEARS
[1:55:58] Patrikhg: well ranger suggest like a bow
[1:55:59] Kobaaya: surv isnt even real "hunter" spec its forced melee shit
[1:56:00] Line_0: dark rangers are also ranged
[1:56:01] ctg_dreamz: Sylvanas and Nathanos are dark rangers and sport swords that's why
[1:56:02] Scargon231: CAN I PET DAT DAWG?!
[1:56:05] vaereee: @MeisterChiefX cap dude
[1:56:11] Camelbak21: I mean it does fit, people have to remember that survival is now melee :=)
[1:56:14] noirlol: survival deserves banger hero talents
[1:56:14] xhinshadow: i think its more about its what surival hunter was about in TBC and WOTLK
[1:56:15] stumie: survival needs to go back to a ranged dps expeditiously
[1:56:15] NotD4k: ye
[1:56:16] Pyrrha_GG: @Standy94 serpent sting, kill shot, explosive shot
[1:56:18] DrQuackzalver: BM & MM shoot stuff, dark ranger shoot stuff. BM & Surv have pets so they will get the pet hero class
[1:56:21] Gapplebees1: bm should have been the melee spec

[1:58:26] Line_0: it needs work but it sounds really cool

[1:59:05] ashelfal: But is Collosus bad because its core damage ability isnt always up? I feel like it being at 50% uptime isnt a huge issue

[2:03:51] bubbles105: F
[2:03:52] jjwallababy: I HAVE
[2:04:01] Niconatelver: The name Lightsmith sounds cool as heck

[2:04:24] NotD4k: cool F
[2:04:29] venyalorelei: vod screenshot
[2:04:32] itsheavydude: someone can screenshot
[2:04:49] NotD4k: no stream F the tier list made an F
[2:04:50] NotD4k: KEKW
[2:04:51] Dberjerak823: Basically hammer
[2:04:52] McScooterson: just raining hammers
[2:04:52] Niconatelver: Reinhart hammer down
[2:04:57] NaBNez: KEKW

[2:06:09] Gapplebees1: Templar sounds fucking awesome lmao
[2:06:13] Niconatelver: McConnel gonna be buzzin
[2:06:14] burne114: Is he talking about Wingsareup?
[2:06:15] vorsmyth: Yo, I don'tt plaay pally and I want to rain hammers on fools
[2:06:20] mikejonesrp: ya that's what we need. More rets to speak up
[2:06:22] GodKingMuninn: towHAMUP towHAMUP towHAMUP towHAMUP towHAMUP
[2:06:25] Madcatmk02: ret definitely vibing
[2:06:27] DunzoCD: towHAMUP
[2:06:31] dogmaster9000: mage will have 3 :)
[2:06:32] KaisenSiru: YEP
[2:06:32] Saahf: yea pallys fucking love blunt trauma
[2:06:33] chubbytheboi: Ofc that is the case, Blizz loves Ret
[2:06:35] Gordiie: 0 frost DK hero talents up. Prayge for double bangers
[2:06:36] Madgeneto: shadow priest surely COPIUM
[2:06:40] foxsunalpha: Have you gotten some good wine yet?
[2:06:45] prugar: @maximum you forgot he likes saying Hammer of fuck your face too
[2:06:48] Left_The_Legacy: @Maximum Please let our voice be heard for a glyph that makes Templars Hammers into swords. Can't help it, but am more of a swords guy.
[2:06:50] Oracle_WoW: im gonna be ok
[2:06:51] theDirtyon3: Swamp ass YEP
[2:06:53] Left_The_Legacy: your*
[2:07:00] zerossussy: Really bad
[2:07:00] planooooooooooooooooooooo: Madge
[2:07:05] zerossussy: feint is fine
[2:07:11] chubbytheboi: @Gordiie strong hopium fellow frost DK brother, strong hopium
[2:07:12] zerossussy: killingspree is SUPER BAD
[2:07:19] asd123qwerty1: @Maximum ever using a defensive for dps is just so bad
[2:07:21] castlecastles: trickster is TURBO ASS
[2:07:24] BigTrout3: keep rogue defensives as defensives Madge
[2:07:28] hectabit: dune movie is great
[2:07:35] zerossussy: feint will make rogue super tanky but its not ideal gameplay
[2:07:35] BigTrout3: i'm sick of vanish being an offensive cooldown
[2:07:37] alishark_: what is this guys?
[2:07:42] Basic_3: Rogues being upset they'd never take damage again.
[2:07:47] zerossussy: distract is super bad
[2:07:51] Whitewolf1441: chat can someone explain what all this is? does it replace specs? or talents?
[2:07:51] zerossussy: i hope they remove it
[2:07:54] antipheonixna: rogues are gonna be unkillable and they could tweak it by making feint duration longer, the rest of the tree is too bad to justify it, needs to be reworked
[2:07:55] Flipeled: yes
[2:07:57] asd123qwerty1: bad mouseover shit
[2:07:58] zerossussy: too much button bloat
[2:07:59] sworduserr: not even button bloat it's just dumb
[2:08:00] chubbytheboi: MAKE THEM USE MORE BUTTONS
[2:08:00] GrimmshadoXI: Rogues have so many buttons though
[2:08:03] sworduserr: distract is utility
[2:08:04] krazeturtle: button bloat is too real rn
[2:08:05] Antillarea: sounds bit cringe
[2:08:07] sworduserr: that is cool to use when you use it
[2:08:08] Domekowski: the moment i have to lose dps because i need to distract a patrol im so done with that talent
[2:08:08] CoffeeASAP: it sounds too much like SL when hunters could cast their flare into tar trap
[2:08:08] splashz0r: not really tbh but if you dont main rogue sure
[2:08:10] zerossussy: we are pressing too many buttons already
[2:08:12] logicaltty: @Whitewolf1441 you get it in addition to your normal talent tree
[2:08:13] Line_0: rogue usually likes utility buttons
[2:08:14] zerossussy: outlaw is insanely hard
[2:08:15] censiGFY: it s straight up too much use of utility buttons into dps rotation, it s absolutely a dogshit design
[2:08:16] Madgeneto: making utility damage is cringe
[2:08:18] zerossussy: we need less intensity
[2:08:30] Whitewolf1441: @logicaltty and specs are still around?
[2:08:32] Gapplebees1: devastation needs tricks of the trade perma
[2:08:33] jjwallababy: worse than lightsmight surely xdd
[2:08:34] smolderdaddyuwu: I like the smoke puff. It's actually distracting
[2:08:36] Rapunzele: @Whitewolf1441 its an addition to your spec, but combines 2 together and it fits a theme of gameplay and style
[2:08:40] bobshallot: lol imagine using tott or misdirection as a dps (1231 io hunter here)
[2:08:43] antipheonixna: idk who has the most rotational abilities rn is it enh ww sub?
[2:08:44] planooooooooooooooooooooo: D4 ist
[2:08:45] imanyone: @zerossussy how are you still awake rn
[2:08:46] Line_0: this is really cool
[2:08:46] sworduserr: @zerossussy i wouldn't say insanely
[2:08:48] cesartcab: 10/10
[2:08:49] sworduserr: it's just fast
[2:08:50] Whitewolf1441: @Rapunzele ah gotcha, ty
[2:08:57] valarmaia: it slaps
[2:08:58] chubbytheboi: I said the rogue dev is doing great job a week ago and he proved me giga wrong with that tree
[2:08:59] isFeyz: theme is 10/10 for demos
[2:09:14] Basic_3: The only panic about this tree is that they need to make Cataclysm easier to get, or it's a concern.
[2:09:18] Madgeneto: Looking cant wait to see what mother of chaos gonna look like
[2:09:30] splashz0r: get fuckin pitted boys
[2:09:34] chubbytheboi: 10/10 demo theme. 1/10 Destro theme for me
[2:09:35] valarmaia: prob a big shivarra
[2:09:44] DunzoCD: they said its incinerates instead of shadowbolts for destro too
[2:09:46] Camelbak21: I don't like the cycling of demons
[2:09:48] antipheonixna: this is like the frostfire tree but for locks seems lit
[2:09:51] Petarglio: This is awesome either way, even as destro I would enjoy playing this
[2:09:51] Camelbak21: demon cycling kinda sucks
[2:09:51] cesartcab: @isFeyz rune gives u the feeling of persuing the summ of a big guys i like it
[2:10:03] cythis_91: Feels like there is no link for destro, though. Does just feel like a demo specific HTT
[2:10:16] GearzxGaming: Infernal vitality is really nice for PvP
[2:10:17] DrQuackzalver: making lockwall give you more sustain is ok
[2:10:18] punkekw: and some classes hog them all
[2:10:23] Basic_3: Pretty sure Warlock is going to be super squishy once they stop stacking Vers.
[2:10:26] chubbytheboi: These talents just make destro into a demo-ish spec
[2:10:27] Camelbak21: It has some cool idea, but the rng with demons is just not cool
[2:10:31] raye_gaming22: WL for sure need more defensives lmao
[2:10:39] chewyy514: super insane for sure
[2:10:43] chewyy514: if implementation works
[2:10:48] Line_0: really cool seems more right
[2:10:50] DunzoCD: seems like demo will get more use out of it, but cool spec
[2:10:51] minikori: it cycles through the demons
[2:10:53] Basic_3: @Camelbak21 They're in a 1>2>3>1 cycle.
[2:10:55] daryl_fish: @chubbytheboi man what a weird thing for the destro/demo hero talents to do
[2:10:55] malacathwow: They aren't rng, they follow an order.
[2:10:56] booznoon: yeah agree, its cool but not insane
[2:10:57] malavander: most of the time I feel like it just adds up to passive damage increase
[2:11:01] pooksterlive: There is no RNG, this sounds dope af as a demo player
[2:11:02] xrandomdoodx: Defensive talents for shaman pls Prayge
[2:11:02] aleafonthewind42m: The general consensus from warlocks is that gameplay is super insane for Demo, and a bit less for Destro @Maximum
[2:11:04] Ravaldknight: they are also tuning demo and destro separately confirmed since they use soul shards at different rates
[2:11:05] DasBull_XD: you know full dang well no lock will say anything but gloom and doom, they'll get their liscence revoked
[2:11:06] Warador117: I feel like it belongs between Really Cool and Super Insane
[2:11:10] Peeachy0: @Maximum as someone who plays both demo and destro if you could move while chanelling that free thing it was be turbo sick so that makes it r"really Cool" imo
[2:11:10] atamdev: kinda bad
[2:11:10] Madgeneto: GIGACHAD
[2:11:10] valarmaia: it was RNG s1 dragonflight, not anymore
[2:11:13] strelockx: Its cool, but not insane i think
[2:11:14] malacathwow: Its  Overlord>Mother Of Chaos> Pitlord> repeat
[2:11:15] Camelbak21: @Basic_3 exactly, so you come into a situation where number 2 would be better than 3...
[2:11:19] GearzxGaming: Mother of Chaos will feel kinda mid in M+ when it's her turn to get summoned
[2:11:21] roadkiill7: destro’s needing cata (as of now with its place on the tree) feels bad but the rest is great
[2:11:22] Niconatelver: make it 15&
[2:11:22] LuciFeariUm: @daryl_fish but they in no way may demo into destro-ish thats the problem
[2:11:23] Line_0: BIGGER
[2:11:23] Deyndra: 50%
[2:11:24] CoffeeASAP: anima power bead bigger
[2:11:24] hertz__i: 15%
[2:11:24] ashelfal: 15-20%
[2:11:25] Marne_: Put it in Super Insane so i can get a warlock in my pug raids
[2:11:25] jjwallababy: 1000000%
[2:11:26] antipheonixna: i think its just missing a bit to lock it in to S, couple tweaks or a replacement talent could make it huge
[2:11:26] nerdpounder123: it should be 10
[2:11:27] BigTrout3: 15%
[2:11:27] Slapsstick: 50% Pog
[2:11:27] Dberjerak823: 25% GIGACHAD
[2:11:28] 74n0: 50%
[2:11:29] JaySevenTTV: the thing that sounds bad to me is if the 3 summons are improperly balanced and you'll start different boss fights with different ones
[2:11:29] Basic_3: @Camelbak21 That isn't what RNG means....
[2:11:29] Peeachy0: cause being forced to stop to channel incin on destro will feel so bad
[2:11:30] mekks_: 15% is good
[2:11:31] DanteSnyders: 15%
[2:11:32] purpformance: 100%
[2:11:33] Sohen: give it like 20 anything more too much
[2:11:33] atamdev: this basically just makes you a little bigger and adds one button to the spec
[2:11:34] Whitewolf1441: 20%
[2:11:35] Line_0: 10% at least
[2:11:38] dango0n: why did you skip death knight?
[2:11:41] joshjarx: thats on top of avatar too right
[2:11:41] muonz: yea just make fyrakk blaze lines harder
[2:11:42] Zarroe: i want to be the tallest gnome in the pack
[2:11:42] cornygerman: could that cause hitbx problems? :D
[2:11:44] Zarroe: xdd
[2:11:44] logain_13: @Camelbak21 That's what a rotation is...
[2:11:48] Spafuncio: You also have Avatar that increases size
[2:11:53] chubbytheboi: @daryl_fish Yeah, I get it's a combo with Demo so it's unavoidable, but still it doesn't fit the destro theme for me, only the demo one
[2:11:56] Sweepstakes86: disruptive? isnt there a rule for hunter pets of not to big?
[2:11:57] MieLULe: @Maximum and there will be case like with DH and rezan now that meta dh is too big and fear goes over LOS by stairs
[2:12:03] PekoKing: so glad they put the leggo active no one likes into this!
[2:12:04] Camelbak21: @Basic_3 Quite literally is RNG depending on timers
[2:12:25] Madcatmk02: @Camelbak21 no that's scripted not RNG
[2:12:30] Luvekh: @dango0n He needs to refresh his memory about the tree at the end
[2:12:38] antipheonixna: bit to omany boring nodes imo, either bottom of mid or kinda bad
[2:12:46] Gapplebees1: tree needs stamina and more size
[2:12:50] Madgeneto: fists of fury xdd
[2:13:08] chubbytheboi: @Camelbak21 Brother, if it's following a sequence it's in no way random
[2:13:13] atamdev: these talents are so boring
[2:13:14] Mythdemeanor: death's advance is somehow always super relevant in raid though
[2:13:27] Sohen: blizzard loves their knockbacks
[2:13:30] Zarroe: CAUGHT he said too much
[2:13:30] CoffeeASAP: ALOO
[2:13:33] Flipeled: ALOO
[2:13:34] Rampo123: CAUGHT
[2:13:35] bigoldmeatpie: ALOO
[2:13:35] theDirtyon3: ALOO
[2:13:39] Slapsstick: WDP movement tech round 2
[2:13:43] lord_konstantine: Templar has no extra defence while Lightsmith does, I hope prot pally doesnt have fights where it must go Lightsmith
[2:13:43] Scoops__: blizzard devs called in monkaW
[2:13:46] Icycutes: there's a tuning world where its better to never press demolish
[2:13:59] antipheonixna: i could 100% see some tier set or something fucking this tree up and making you not press demolish KEKW
[2:14:16] Gapplebees1: colossus needs stamina buff
[2:14:30] Mythdemeanor: @Icycutes and test of might could push it into that if demolish doesn't cost rage
[2:14:33] SpeedyMcD: i really hope arms gets a rework like ret did. it just feels and plays like an outdated spec
[2:14:43] Ashille: music feels like I'm in an elevator (sorry just made me laugh)
[2:14:51] Chiick_: the theme is so cool
[2:14:52] 74n0: @Gapplebees1 too strong together with the dr
[2:14:59] Nico56400: It probably depends on demolish animation
[2:15:02] atamdev: nah its boring
[2:15:09] helscreamkappa: demolish is basicaly fyr alath active
[2:15:09] donflamingofps: this will be on yt ?
[2:15:13] Chaewon5: chat if I want to play a high apm melee class and not have to worry about multispeccing, do you think havoc dh would be the best bet?
[2:15:16] Slapsstick: if demolish is fun to press then itll be banger
[2:15:17] bobshallot: its warrior of course it wont be fun to play
[2:15:17] imanyone: It seems so warrior tho - smack stuff be big do dam
[2:15:23] atamdev: kinda bad honestly
[2:15:24] planooooooooooooooooooooo: theme can do a LOT though
[2:15:25] Niconatelver: How is there not a tier called "cool" above mid?
[2:15:29] Mythdemeanor: this sounds cool but I think I'm more excited for the arms/fury tree cause I expect it to focus on execute
[2:15:39] atamdev: but is being bigger a great theme?
[2:15:56] Scoops__: lightning warrior Pog
[2:16:03] gamatommy: MID
[2:16:08] Florqt: @atamdev yes
[2:16:12] bigoldmeatpie: i love the idea of using thunderclap instead of whirlwind
[2:16:21] Testifiable: mid or kinda bad, low chance for a lightning bolt to happen... meh
[2:16:22] gamatommy: all warr specs play avatar
[2:16:26] smolderdaddyuwu: Nailed the mountain thane theme @maximum
[2:16:36] kino_xo: we cap at 4 KEKW
[2:16:43] planooooooooooooooooooooo: but this will make future tiersets based on non-avatar builds feel terrible to play
[2:16:52] Madgeneto: no sho trickster is as bad as oracle
[2:17:10] Lyonidus: a lot of these talents seem really similar and follow the whole "this ability spreads to/hits nearby enemies" schtick
[2:17:13] planooooooooooooooooooooo: feels enhance man Sadge
[2:17:13] 74n0: frfr no cap
[2:17:14] Whitewolf1441: that makes sense
[2:17:15] xrandomdoodx: Ele sham Sadge
[2:17:18] stumie: love a good cranking
[2:17:24] psychopomp555: good evening max
[2:17:29] GrimmshadoXI: @Madgeneto They have to press feint on CD.. that's really bad. Also adding distract as another button to press
[2:17:30] chubbytheboi: sad frost DK noises
[2:17:33] antipheonixna: well it also depends how often ur niche exists and how many profiles u can fufill, if ur the best 6 target class and mid everywhere else gg
[2:17:44] Madgeneto: @GrimmshadoXI i know
[2:17:46] Grimm303: thats so many different target counts to balance that many options at, theyre never gonna do that, they should remove target caps tbh
[2:17:46] Jumanjiqt: Just don't intervene goblin tanks
[2:18:05] Madgeneto: @GrimmshadoXI but you dont have to press feint after the first time bc aa's apply it
[2:18:12] vaerlyn: Theme feels like a miss for a lot of warriors ive talked to
[2:18:15] syzurup: did they already say how many points were going to have to spend in these hero trees?
[2:18:19] Mythdemeanor: completely depends on if we play raging blow again or not i think
[2:18:23] 74n0: will you be able to change these hero talents freely?
[2:18:35] Madgeneto: @GrimmshadoXI in st and as outlaw at least
[2:18:44] Mythdemeanor: @74n0 yeah just like regular talents
[2:19:08] 74n0: @Mythdemeanor Susge
[2:19:22] Gapplebees1: @74n0 so fury already has 15% more health than arms, and this tree has stamina in it... but colossus is too much?
[2:19:31] Chiick_: Need to fix tree to take thunderclap on fury
[2:19:35] silmarilen: for fury it doesnt really make much sense, it doesnt have an identity and tries to make you do everything
[2:19:37] silmarilen: for prot it's cool
[2:19:41] Dzor12: what if your tier set isn't good for bloodthirst tho?
[2:19:43] booznoon: you got rng on rng tho
[2:19:48] FrilleJr: GIGACHAD dwarf
[2:19:49] gamatommy: for fury this shit sucks
[2:19:52] smolderdaddyuwu: Yes. Bangs
[2:19:54] Madgeneto: @GrimmshadoXI anyway there's no way it's as bad as random rng pi's/random premonition effects or whatever it's called
[2:19:57] WolfgangAmpersand: Great for Prot, average for Fury.
[2:20:00] Mythdemeanor: kinda mid for fury tbh
[2:20:07] zephed: enhancement warrior
[2:20:10] antipheonixna: fury can use an ability thunderclap fits in nicely
[2:20:14] smolderdaddyuwu: I said bang bang bangity bang
[2:20:17] chubbytheboi: Mountain Thane will clap more than Johnny Sins in a month
[2:20:28] stumie: Looking
[2:20:34] sensibleturnip: NO
[2:20:38] Genkar85: it replaces whirlwind
[2:20:39] Dzor12: Nope
[2:20:40] Blackeye1992: no
[2:20:40] Genkar85: so yeah
[2:20:40] Mythdemeanor: no
[2:20:45] cuck_norris__: cheek clap
[2:20:45] Chiick_: we dont even use it right now

[2:20:48] gamatommy: nopers
[2:20:56] SkunkTruck: its fine, if its just a replacement for whilrwind
[2:20:58] aendenicus: it seems fine just replace whirlwind with thunder clap now
[2:20:59] bigmeanbeefy: So its vision of perfection from BFA, thats pog!
[2:21:02] roadkiill7: who doesn’t wanna thunderclap those cheeks
[2:21:02] sensibleturnip: nope
[2:21:05] daryl_fish: Man I bet thundeclap feels good if it does big dam
[2:21:06] antipheonixna: i think its gonna be good, sometimes u just fill with whirlwind
[2:21:07] JackOfAllApocalypses: I dunno, there's always some shit button you press...it being thunderclap is fine
[2:21:08] Blackeye1992: what about rampage
[2:21:10] FloatNg: easily enough room
[2:21:13] bigoldmeatpie: it does replace whirlwind
[2:21:16] Line_0: It might feel better than people think
[2:21:17] Mintyfreshhx: I could kinda see it being fun as a replacement for whirlwind but xddShrug
[2:21:17] Mythdemeanor: if it hard replaces whirlwind i'd like it better than having to figure out if it procced every 4 seconds
[2:21:20] dritotv: fury needs another button to hit, too many open GCDS
[2:21:25] JackOfAllApocalypses: seems fine tbh
[2:21:27] cleetus_mcyeets: we already forced into dookie ass slam instead of raging blow currently. Nothing wrong with Thundercap over whirlwind if it doesn't cost us 2 extra talent points
[2:21:28] Dzor12: Feel like Fury is so high APM that it's hard to fit any more buttons in there
[2:21:32] vaerlyn: Isn't fury super high apm
[2:21:39] just_ie: @maximum getting your main cooldown as a random proc is only fun if the way you gain the proc isnt invasive to your rotation. DRE for an example is fucking cringe and a mistake of a design
[2:21:43] silmarilen: the problem is not with the thunderclap part, it's with the other nodes trying to buff different abilities that we can't really make worth pressing at the same time
[2:21:45] yuhhhhe: target cap needs to be removed on fury
[2:21:45] Dzor12: Looks S+ for Prot
[2:21:48] Genkar85: if it fully replaces current whirlwind then we will be clapping the cheeks

[2:31:06] Madcatmk02: I don't think there's anything wrong with that tbh

[2:31:21] planooooooooooooooooooooo: Susge
[2:31:22] rilsolo: if it could make disintegrate become fire damage that would be sick maybe
[2:31:23] ashelfal: thats just because dev evoker is pits design
[2:31:24] journeyman25: pyre / living flame / fire breath etc
[2:31:24] dwok94: Chill streak SUCKS
[2:31:27] clickermekk: i just want that firestorm ability to be cool
[2:31:28] RedalousTheRed: I'd love them to be able to red a way to boost single target with pyre
[2:31:29] Mythdemeanor: DELETE IT
[2:31:31] Primit1ve: Probably revolves around dragon fury tbh
[2:31:32] dwok94: Its fizzeling so often
[2:31:33] GodKingMuninn: Dev already needs another reqwork after the devasation rework was an aboslute failure
[2:31:34] Nickystr1x: could be living flame oriented since it’s with pres too @maximum
[2:31:36] guynormally: firestorm has been bad all xpac
[2:31:41] journeyman25: firestorm dot
[2:31:46] antipheonixna: they said specifically they didnt want one of aoe and for ST, they would make pyre do more damage in ST 100% @Maximum

[2:32:02] thenateo2: mage = good
[2:32:04] Line_0: Sunfury sounds sick
[2:32:04] Mythdemeanor: any pyre related talents in ruby adept will just work off emerald blossom as well for pres
[2:32:04] aendenicus: sunfury is gonna be giga sick, literally KT
[2:32:09] KaisenSiru: anniesThisIsFine

[2:32:23] Icycutes: druid of the claw probably good
[2:32:25] FrenzyBurn: Sentinel k

[2:32:45] ohfoeshow: what it is to burn
[2:32:48] baseboned: weird pally has the best and worst ones (not counting Oracle which doesn't count anymore)
[2:32:52] Mythdemeanor: fire breath/living flame oriented most likely
[2:32:53] GuilherMELHOR: @Maximum what do you think they can do with rogues since they already suffer from button bloat and already have specific burst windows?
[2:32:54] JanSladkovsky: can you make another division swap ass and put there disc hero talents, i am dics player and cant breathe from what the guys are smokin there to make such a bs talents
[2:32:59] IamBadSry: How many do you think they have to rework in the first couple patches?
[2:33:00] MrExOhTV: Really hope one of the Shaman Hero Talents gives reason for Elemental to be taken to Raid
[2:33:05] Faraday5001: \[T]/
[2:33:13] baseboned: I'm not sure it's going to get remade

[2:33:21] aFlyingGuru: ABOBA
[2:33:21] tribin01: @Maximum what if it's about charging up a super Pyre that does giga dmg in single target and AoE
[2:33:26] Mythdemeanor: @MrExOhTV totemic YEP fury of the sky
[2:33:29] just_ie: @maximum which hero tree do you think will get a full theme (name and tree) rework the fastest, and why is it totemic?
[2:33:29] thepartyzone: celestial conduit sounds wild
[2:33:35] mantooth11: 100% chance stormbringer forces ice fury build right?

[2:33:35] bobshallot: Prayge hunters be bad
[2:33:36] M0nkeys: I wouldn't call them amazing, templar maybe but herald of the sun leaves behind a patch of sunburn big woop
[2:33:39] riddlerboy: I think Keeper of the grove is super subjective, some people gonna love it, some gonna hate it
[2:33:41] athcoids: shadowpriests are in a bad spot... their trees will get released last with "not enough time to fix them"
[2:33:46] Madgeneto: mw brew?
[2:33:46] baseboned: we dont know
[2:33:47] Smeeshed: nah, kinda bad is gonna stay bad so that's the worst spot

[2:33:56] GearzxGaming: prolly mw and brew

[2:34:24] Scoops__: really
[2:34:25] kyletalkss: As a BDK main sanlayan looks so boring
[2:34:25] Tomq0: i hope they release the other ones soon
[2:34:32] journeyman25: Totemic sounds like Aug
[2:34:33] Drax_1224: haha stupid leaf boy

[2:34:37] spivet: furion mains from dota 2 are gonna eat they love making trees

[2:35:15] antipheonixna: @Maximum is there any spec you think is gonna get reworked in war within based on the trees or hunches
[2:35:15] smashedtaters: Kappa
[2:35:19] planooooooooooooooooooooo: peepoFAT
[2:35:23] Wincrediboy: @kyletalkss boring to play and really shitty experience because you rely on getting random procs before VB comes back up or you lose huge damage when you played no differently

[2:36:35] Peeachy0: Void weaver kind of sounds like if it is Super Insane, Shadow priest could staple 4 dps in the meta, idk if that makes sense
[2:36:38] Kyrianel: Theme wise, keeper of the grove is perfect imo, in Warcraft 3, summoning Treants was like their most famous ability after tranquility. Thats what keepers of the groves do, they summon trees.
[2:36:40] Mythdemeanor: sounds wrong
[2:36:40] thattrokdude: offt
[2:36:41] Grimm303: why would you do that

[2:37:14] Icycutes: only unhealthy fats over here
[2:37:14] GodKingMuninn: big veggie dinner for endurance
[2:37:17] JackOfAllApocalypses: cheese is gross...

[2:59:44] Wincrediboy: but BDK casts DnD almost every 10 sec, so I think it averages out to perma 50% slow, but actually scaling down from 90%
[2:59:59] Icycutes: THEME >>>
[3:00:04] Mythdemeanor: kinda weird yeah
[3:00:25] krissis_: no faster swimming GRRR
[3:00:30] AsapHorde: the theme and human form is a waste  of time and super niche and Cat is also super niche
[3:00:36] Mythdemeanor: wild charge is boomkin's only actual movement though right? -3s cooldown sounds nice
[3:00:42] Yslingshot: amen
[3:00:44] sethron: amen
[3:00:45] planooooooooooooooooooooo: Madge
[3:00:49] kian_acc: 🐄
[3:00:50] rukt: finally

[3:00:52] dango0n: where did DK land on the tier list?
[3:00:58] jamillimcchilli: ye 10min is more than i could endure
[3:01:04] LuciFeariUm: MOOOnkin
[3:01:05] just_ie: I fucking hate moonkins man
[3:01:10] ciphkin_tv: @Maximum I've been uncomfortable with the amount of boomie content lately. leave us alone
[3:01:10] SgtBigCactus: what's the cringiest term for balance druid
[3:01:14] Pudzianos: Azor has video for dark ranger
[3:01:14] weazem: kripp Pog
[3:01:31] headninja1ncharge: What a name
[3:01:33] planooooooooooooooooooooo: gildworls
[3:01:35] Theblueninjashen: its brutal yeah
[3:01:41] Theblueninjashen: new boss
[3:01:47] aFlyingGuru: @Maximum theres a new fight in guild wars, harder than anything else in the game by far
[3:01:52] Theblueninjashen: 4th day of progress
[3:01:56] fzzld: he was saying the new boss is harder than prenerf fyrakk
[3:02:08] Mazmerized: really cool choice of what mechanics you make harder mechanic in this fight, kinda ish like that one boomer mop boss
[3:02:13] theDirtyon3: those puddles are shit tbh
[3:02:17] theDirtyon3: even i can see that
[3:02:35] insanity_233: max my guild mdi event is super fun
[3:02:39] reymargera: KEKW
[3:02:41] aFlyingGuru: he didnt say that im sure
[3:02:46] headninja1ncharge: Big true
[3:02:46] Mazmerized: he aint say that lol
[3:02:47] Crystallize007: 60 people Yep
[3:03:00] kags158: didn't you only just watch it max? (jk jk)
[3:03:02] Gambit2012: then why we talkn bout it?
[3:03:13] Madgeneto: i dont know him but i know he didnt say it
[3:03:15] metalfks: KEKW
[3:03:16] theDirtyon3: xdd
[3:03:34] theDirtyon3: their puddles could be ALOT better
[3:03:38] Brohdin: Does GW2 have addons that help with this at all?
[3:03:39] Mazmerized: when they phase whichever big add they kill makes that mechanic harder or whatever i think
[3:03:40] MorpheenBE: Pretty wild that there isn't the OneGuy emote in here of all places
[3:03:41] Theblueninjashen: he didn't compare this boss with wow buff but he said that it's probably the hardest boss ever been release
[3:03:44] rukt: NOTED
[3:03:44] ZugThugTV: KEKW
[3:03:47] gdtomii: KEKW
[3:03:47] UnheardGrace: that is such a max character name
[3:03:48] Madgeneto: this guy just telporting around
[3:03:51] Faraday5001: when we bringing back Cleetus McLonghaul? @Maximum
[3:03:52] aFlyingGuru: @Brohdin nope, there's  no weakauras or bigwigs or anything of the sort
[3:03:52] Mythdemeanor: sounds like a dwarf
[3:03:53] Niconatelver: like a orange shrimp?
[3:04:09] Phantasiie: This looks similar to holondrous
[3:04:20] Slapsstick: drunk truck sim\
[3:04:21] Powzoar: lol
[3:04:22] theDirtyon3: no shot you ever RP
[3:04:25] Powzoar: Esfand is Cletus
[3:04:25] Dzor12: Dude American Truck Sim is so fun as just a turn brain off game and chill out
[3:04:27] JWallace: yeah Cletus is taken
[3:04:27] Artheeri: ,,the vaccine isn't real!!" -Cleetus McLonghaul
[3:04:28] SgtBigCactus: what the fuck is this smooth jazz we're listening to
[3:04:28] reymargera: Cletus Cornwood
[3:04:28] theDirtyon3: YEP
[3:04:28] heffdogga: Cleetus Cornwood
[3:04:29] logicaltty: cletus cornwood
[3:04:29] Powzoar: Cletus Cornwood
[3:04:30] Mythdemeanor: he does, cletus cornwood
[3:04:31] Clindo_: Cletus cornwood
[3:04:32] JWallace: Cletus cornwood
[3:04:35] KaisenSiru: Sadge
[3:04:35] GodKingMuninn: you might be thinking as CletusTBueford
[3:04:35] OG_Kawngi: BAR FOR BAR
[3:04:38] theDirtyon3: nha hes done that for years @Maximum
[3:04:40] KillUAssie: Cletus cornwood yeah
[3:04:41] winterstretch: i always thought it would be perfect for gtarp
[3:04:43] headninja1ncharge: Bar for Bar word for word
[3:04:43] Powzoar: Long lost brother?
[3:04:46] KillUAssie: he’s a sheriff
[3:04:50] Niconatelver: He has had it long time
[3:04:51] iPsyop: his cletus was before yours
[3:04:53] logicaltty: he was first
[3:04:56] Powzoar: Genius think alike obv
[3:04:57] logicaltty: i think you took the name from a chatter who got it from esfand
[3:04:59] theDirtyon3: LOL
[3:05:00] meterpooney: I think Cleetus is a pretty universal funny name
[3:05:01] GabsTheBard_: yea he was definitely first
[3:05:02] gali5656: could rename to something like Jasper
[3:05:09] Powzoar: "Dleetus"
[3:05:14] stryped: what game is this?
[3:05:16] theDirtyon3: no shot you RP anyways those servers cost money to get into these days @Maximum
[3:05:17] Mazmerized: greens are soaks in gw2 in a way
[3:05:19] aFlyingGuru: green circles are soaks
[3:05:20] baseboned: Cleetus was in The Simpsons 30 years ago, WHO CARES
[3:05:21] Mythdemeanor: i think they had a spread and a share mechanic both
[3:05:21] Fray24_: His Cleetus bigger than yours yeah
[3:05:22] GabsTheBard_: @stryped GW 2
[3:05:25] stumie: they patched the green soak mechanic. 3 people per soak and they're randomly assigned

[3:05:51] Powzoar: @Maximum when you seeing Dune?
[3:06:04] dango0n: you going to do a balatro playthrough?
[3:06:16] ddlrr: Dew and the boys play this weekend go TL
[3:06:18] aFlyingGuru: 3 soaks and you only have 10 ppl, every soak needs 3 ppl and if you fail it insta wipes the raid
[3:06:22] Demon922: gm of nascent
[3:06:25] stumie: audiobook content Pog
[3:06:26] DanteDemonZ: i would love to see your react to that
[3:06:37] kravmagaga: o pog i was hoping you'd talk about that post
[3:06:42] baseboned: Jak's bloat video is NOT good
[3:06:44] raja17_: Its not that long
[3:06:46] alarkin: TL:DR of that post = mythic is too hard and unrewarding, blizz pls fix
[3:06:48] Paleee_: @Maximum *** do these numbers seem right?
[3:06:51] dknamey: yeah cdew tweet
[3:06:52] Scoops__: east coast
[3:06:53] notprofitbtw: !bdg
[3:06:59] remli1991: in netherlands?
[3:07:00] stumie: @alarkin nahhhh
[3:07:04] Grimm303: theyre us east somewhere for ping
[3:07:26] thefuntown: mythic is like 3 difficulties in a trench coat
[3:07:31] taanzfour: ATM mythic raiding is not that rewarding indeed
[3:07:35] valk113: did i miss the hero ranking?
[3:07:35] taanzfour: the gear is piss
[3:07:40] stumie: @thefuntown this is actually so true damn
[3:08:26] thegrt13: its also about how gear doesn't end up nerfing the fight b/c we're already so powerful by the time you get to frank and tindy
[3:08:29] axetomouthh: WoW should do ultimate raids like ff14 for top guilds and then release nerfed mythic day one
[3:08:34] WarWesker88: should make a tier list for s4 dungeons they will add or wont add?
[3:08:42] SgtBigCactus: recognize some of those words
[3:09:00] Basic_3: Every almost-CE guild I've been in is 13 good players and 6-8 heroic players who you needed to fill in your roster.
[3:09:08] Phantasiie: The problem with mythic is they everything thinks they deserve to clear mythic
[3:09:09] eeveejayy: @SgtBigCactus gear is equipment you place on your character to improve stats
[3:09:11] Scoops__: well thats mostly cause m+ rewards keep up sort of right and catalyst kind of
[3:09:14] baseboned: it should be less rewarding, make it cosmetic and titles only
[3:09:17] Brohdin: Is M+ too rewarding then? @Maximum
[3:09:20] os390: @WarWesker88 Did they announce the pool?
[3:09:26] Basic_3: Gear nerfed Smolderon, just not Tindral
[3:09:30] miraagex: cba farming flightstones/crests
[3:09:34] zonguito_: if mythic raid isnt enough rewarding, then same for very big MM+ runs
[3:09:48] Judgejudyx: have u seen the fyrak strat of lust on pull to make p1 faster
[3:09:51] dustin_handsupdb: like 481 or something?
[3:09:54] cheddabang24: @Maximum what happen to bdg? im late
[3:09:56] steki47: what happened with bdg
[3:10:02] Niconatelver: My guild just stopped raiding after 344 pulls on smoldaron (still no kill)
[3:10:04] WarWesker88: @os390 nah , i havent seen anything on it
[3:10:07] MBG_95: Plus the he enchant this tier
[3:10:08] taanzfour: check last tindral kil
[3:10:10] lawgivver7: Yo @maximum, I remember back on N'Zoth there was a dev that was going to tell you what happened behind the scenes while the RWF was going on. Did you ever find out what happened?
[3:10:12] auby6: not just more gear but more optimized gear and stats @Maximum
[3:10:15] Gambit2012: 10 more ilvl with 10% less hp
[3:10:15] taanzfour: scrap that
[3:10:15] Nico56400: It might be controversial but i'd prefer if Mythic raid didn't drop gear and was only cosmetics and achievments
[3:10:21] Galarian_Hp: my gear was 481 week 4, then 1 ivl each week after
[3:10:29] Pudzianos: but your players are doing insane more dmg at that ilvl than we on 488
[3:10:37] Madgeneto: same
[3:10:39] baseboned: based
[3:10:50] headninja1ncharge: Nah
[3:11:03] gfkoe: make m+ the only gear
[3:11:07] baseboned: if that was true then those people dont want to be there anyway
[3:11:12] Mazmerized: ff14 also has savage which is like mythic raiding, plus ultimate on top of that so is an extra thing not the only thing
[3:11:17] Phantasiie: Imagine if there was a tier above mythic called RWF that was all bosses before changes that dropped cosmetics
[3:11:23] quarantedeux: the hardest part of mythic for non serious (like me) is simply the commitment
[3:11:36] gouldinglol: ppl skip bosses with bad loot, so clearly it matters some
[3:11:44] Gizpachi: the ultimates give nice cosmetics
[3:11:45] Madgeneto: @Phantasiie so unkillable KEKW
[3:11:50] bayazijr: Dont thinnk i would play the game if they removed gear from mythic raid
[3:12:08] Gambit2012: you get it from m+ anyway
[3:12:08] Galarian_Hp: u guys also did mythic without head enchant
[3:12:39] syzurup: think we get a stat squish soon?
[3:12:59] taanzfour: most people would just smash their head against the wall
[3:13:07] GodKingMuninn: mythic abrely has anyone who does it more than once.
[3:13:15] Brohdin: Probably less than 5
[3:13:15] gouldinglol: like 2
[3:13:18] Treebuckett: Very little
[3:13:24] Niconatelver: We still cant kill smoldaron after 344 wipes
[3:13:24] gfkoe: well they have more gear
[3:13:33] Mythdemeanor: without the reward behind it i don't even know if YOUR guild would do it
[3:13:45] NaBNez: zzz
[3:13:48] nickis211: That's just happening now with current bosses no RWF mode LMAO
[3:13:57] Camelbak21: Could still normalize gear a little, and maybe give mythic a higher chance of getting tertiaries etc so it would still be rewarding idk
[3:14:00] Galarian_Hp: doing bosses like that with 1-2 raid days each week would suck
[3:14:05] Clush___: @Maximum how about they add a trinket bonus for M+ trinkets like pvp has so i never have to enter a raid again, that sounds like a banger
[3:14:10] smolderdaddyuwu: What reward? It's just bragging rights
[3:14:12] Pudzianos: we are almost full bis at 2nd to 3rd last boss anyway so we do it for achievement/mount than gear
[3:14:14] vrailljenkins: has max already done the hero talent rankings?
[3:14:22] steki47: anyone here who cant decide what to main wow
[3:14:28] SkunkTruck: our raid group quit after like 20 pulls of mythic igira
[3:14:40] quarantedeux: MDI raiding edition
[3:14:44] Slapsstick: ilvl wouldnt need to be dropped to still be ungodly difficult for most, honestly just make it a set scaling at max ilvl for the patch and then make it the mechanics y'all had to do when it was cleared
[3:14:55] vrailljenkins: the issue with this current tier is the return of all the pass/fail mechanics. they said in SOD that they fucked up with that
[3:15:00] hahaBDW: score 10/10 of the latest raid? easy 8 right?
[3:15:02] DanteDemonZ: it shouldn't be a joke but it should be more accessible
[3:15:05] hahaBDW: 1/10*
[3:15:06] Wincrediboy: how long do you think it should take a typical CE guild to clear a raid?
[3:15:08] Treebuckett: They should just do a brawlers arena version of mythic raids
[3:15:10] Lothland: open flex after ball of fame
[3:15:11] Kooznik: 10m mythic would increase people doing the hardest content
[3:15:16] Zaisx: I'd quit if mythic was made to be too easy
[3:15:20] Lothland: hall too thanks autocorrect
[3:15:28] Whitewolf1441: difficulty wise
[3:15:31] mcphatty: as long as you get the achievment?
[3:15:34] baseboned: median
[3:15:35] isFeyz: I don't understand why people are so concerned with high level raiding. It's not like people don't enjoy playing football, just because they are not in the Super Bowl.
[3:15:39] Gizpachi: maybe a top 200 guild?
[3:15:43] Sanktified: just got in, why Rip BDG?
[3:15:47] quarantedeux: @Maximum to be fair they could also have easier bosses but with no way to do splits, you'd still be fighting bosses on hard mode (without gear)
[3:15:47] Ravs85: i think the main problem is that people wont accept where their ceiling is, and think they should be able to do all mythic content without that level of effort
[3:15:51] smolderdaddyuwu: How many hours does that guild raid?
[3:15:52] gfkoe: better question, how many guilds do you think should be able to get cutting edge?
[3:15:53] antipheonixna: what if they made heroic harder and then mythic came out later but all the bosses were smolderon lvl and higher
[3:15:54] Wincrediboy: say top 200 then
[3:15:54] Paleee_: Cross realm day 1 next xpac is also probably gonna double the number of mythic bosses killed
[3:15:57] Nico56400: And probably more would stay  if Mythic wasn't so complicated (20 people grind ) + diffuclty
[3:16:02] clickermekk: i mean... im a CE raider and got it last two tiers. still on mythic tindral at 20%
[3:16:06] Jnxz: 2
[3:16:10] DanteDemonZ: that is a good question
[3:16:16] smolderdaddyuwu: @sanktified rip BDG. They called stopping race stuff.
[3:16:23] DanteDemonZ: @clickermekk I haven't even got past 50% yet
[3:16:28] baseboned: one googol
[3:16:33] baseboned: a googol guilds
[3:16:33] TommyC06wow: @clickermekk same were 500 pulls in and 9% wipe
[3:16:34] cornygerman: 237
[3:16:45] binarybarbee: Maybe percentage is the better metric?
[3:16:47] NotoriousDruid: Can/do blizzard devs clear the raid on mythic, before it goes live for world first races?
[3:16:47] Treebuckett: How many players get CE every tier? What's the stats on that? As a percentage of the whole playerbase
[3:16:48] criselbart: Like 1500 get ce usually i think
[3:16:53] antipheonixna: do we even know how many are trying
[3:16:57] Sanktified: @smolderdaddyuwu oh dang, thanks for the update
[3:17:00] DanteDemonZ: a guild on my server took 1200 wipes to clear tindral
[3:17:05] LionButLeon: xdd
[3:17:06] riltro: @clickermekk We just killed it tonight. on to Fyrakk!
[3:17:06] Mythdemeanor: no lol
[3:17:09] WhoAmIAgain_: xdd
[3:17:10] Stephy_Mariee: KEKW NO
[3:17:11] Starcillo: xdd
[3:17:11] DestructiveSin: kekw
[3:17:11] miraagex: xdd
[3:17:11] baseboned: I couldn't handle still progging raid after 3 months
[3:17:12] dustin_handsupdb: @NotoriousDruid no way
[3:17:12] ThisIzD: xdding
[3:17:13] Slapsstick: no
[3:17:13] dango0n: I got AOTC
[3:17:13] periphrase: KEKW
[3:17:14] Khirality: No
[3:17:14] malnourish_: xdding
[3:17:15] Theblueninjashen: lol no
[3:17:16] Boreall: I mean undoubtedly no, right?
[3:17:18] VRVento: well they dont have a chef so no not likely
[3:17:18] baseboned: glad I get Aotc and bounce
[3:17:19] just_ie: My guild just got to p3 fyrakk and at the end of our night we were rank 590
[3:17:19] vrailljenkins: no. blizzard devs cannot do that content
[3:17:23] smolderdaddyuwu: @sanktified np. There was a post somewhere but I didn't see link. Probably could Google it.
[3:17:25] Sylvival: they dont need to
[3:17:29] Basic_3: People overestimate how much being good at the game and being a good dev correlate. They don't really.
[3:17:32] jables90: ffxiv has internal testing that can clear ultimate before shipping
[3:17:32] clickermekk: @riltro nice! keep going just Fyrakk in the way
[3:17:34] FrilleJr: blizz devs 1 - liquid/echo 0
[3:17:34] Starcillo: they live test it xdd
[3:17:42] smolderdaddyuwu: 3 secs seeds? KEKW
[3:17:43] NotoriousDruid: Yes, how do they know where to set the start limit  of difficulty on mythic for everyone.
[3:17:48] LuciFeariUm: 3 sec seeds
[3:17:50] NotoriousDruid: ahh ok you answered the question
[3:17:55] Wincrediboy: couldn't they do something like test it with death immunity, and then count how many times they die in testing?
[3:18:00] Do0dy93: it's weird to see everyone talking about getting CE by the end of season and i'm wondering if my guild is gonna manage to clear it on HC
[3:18:05] Pudzianos: 3 sec seeds ok
[3:18:06] Galarian_Hp: when they nerfed Tindral hp by 20%, tells ur everything
[3:18:10] DragneelL9: What happened to bdg?
[3:18:16] antipheonixna: its a notion that doesn't make sense, why would all the best players be playing it and making it
[3:18:17] Deadzachtv: @Maximum u imagine they purposefully make a fight low tuned before its open to get world first? KEKW
[3:18:19] LionButLeon: GIGACHAD
[3:18:21] jesuslouise: GIGACHAD
[3:18:29] Zaisx: GIGACHAD
[3:18:33] TommyC06wow: @Galarian_Hp didnt fix any of the issues
[3:19:01] Whitewolf1441: @DragneelL9 disband :(
[3:19:01] taanzfour: gotta love RWF
[3:19:07] taanzfour: for 2 weeks its just always there to tune in to
[3:19:10] Mythdemeanor: that's why they chain nerf mythic raid in the first 6 weeks and rarely buff anything
[3:19:24] just_ie: Thats kinda scary, cause when they overshoot your skill level, then raszageth happens
[3:19:28] nezo_pont: Max your beard is looking glorious today
[3:19:30] skydollnoa: why is dog check always out of stock rolyat2Cry
[3:19:35] Wyvenn: Max do you think for TWW we should expect fights to be harder such as tindral and fyrakk or slightly easier fights since classes seem to be becoming more complex?
[3:19:36] Do0dy93: @Maximum have you done a boss in RWF that was easier than it should have been (not including any nerfs)
[3:19:40] phranq208: gear doesn't really passively nerf much anymore
[3:19:50] TommyC06wow: they need to go back to the icc version of nerfs every 2 weeks a 5% buff and thats the standard for each tier
[3:20:01] noirlol: but why??? the whole raid gets death nerfed , whats the problem
[3:20:03] skydollnoa: at this rate i m gonna be halfway to make thd mod
[3:20:06] stumie: 100%
[3:20:10] Boreall: Do you think you could have killed Mythic Smolderon Day 1 of the raid being released?
[3:20:15] kelly_mac06: they GOT crucified for that in Emerald Nightmare LOL
[3:20:17] gouldinglol: if ppl want easy raids, that's what classic is for
[3:20:18] antipheonixna: the space of heroic end boss and early mythic boss is weird no?
[3:20:20] M0nkeys: emerald nightmare?
[3:20:21] stumie: i mean they already got crucified for amidrassil when you guys swept through the first 6 bosses KEKW
[3:20:29] stumie: "raid is too easy!"
[3:20:35] Zaisx: arent normal/heroic exactly for ppl who want easy raids?
[3:20:40] noirlol: if they want easy stuff, just wait 2 month when its nerfed to death or play classic
[3:20:43] frostie36: The best part is, we have proof they'd get crucified... ppl gave them shit over Emerald Nightmare

[3:20:48] Nico56400: It feels bad to have the best gear locked behind content that 99% of the player base can't or don't have the time to clear
[3:20:50] baseboned: Devil's advocate; it was easier during the most popular period of wow
[3:20:52] Treebuckett: RWF is a spectacle and great content to watch. It's fine if they nerf if after for the rest of the playerbase
[3:20:55] TommyC06wow: they need to go back to the icc version of nerfs every 2 weeks a 5% buff and thats the standard for each tier
[3:20:59] skydollnoa: raid is too easy, yet i still have ppl dropping tornados in melee in lfr while on my alts
[3:21:00] Haloxs: somebody got a clip for the final ranking?
[3:21:04] Crowharrick: You may be familiar with this: Lost Ark waits until the 10th group to kill the original raid before nerfing it for the masses.
[3:21:09] LionButLeon: YEP
[3:21:10] Slapsstick: people just think they are entitled to clear mythic, it shouldnt be something everyone can clear in the time frame
[3:21:13] Brohdin: Heroic gear is totally worthless compared to mythic plus in terms of effort
[3:21:14] Flobosama: heroic gear is so close to mythic gear tho, 483 to 489 difference feels barely worth it
[3:21:14] auby6: bro gear does not matter in heroic and normal
[3:21:15] LionButLeon: big numbers good YEP
[3:21:17] rosca89: even post nerf tindral is farming my guild
[3:21:18] miraagex: loooot :)
[3:21:30] baseboned: whose aren't game modes
[3:21:35] baseboned: those are different games
[3:21:35] Thdlock: DELETE GEAR FROM M+
[3:21:38] Pudzianos: we are wearing bis ilvl from vault
[3:21:41] balanceis: @baseboned true
[3:21:46] MorpheenBE: @Thdlock GIGACHAD
[3:21:47] miraagex: @Thdlock BASED
[3:21:49] racks22: @Thdlock AMEN
[3:21:51] DestructiveSin: @Thdlock no :)
[3:21:53] JWallace: I don’t want mythic to be easier because I love the viewer experience of the rwf and I think a lot of people feel the same.  I look forward to it every time
[3:21:54] skydollnoa: rolyat2Gasp
[3:21:55] malnourish_: i think it would be insane to not have high level aspirational content
[3:21:56] Wyvenn: I wonder what TWW raids will look like
[3:21:57] M0nkeys: I kinda wish they would just give us our bis gear in the mail and we could just have fun playing the game
[3:21:58] Ashille: delete gear from wow
[3:21:59] stumie: @Thdlock GIGACHAD
[3:22:03] Stauss: @Thdlock BASED
[3:22:04] jesuslouise: @Thdlock replace all gear with AP
[3:22:05] baseboned: delete gear from mplus garf
[3:22:06] Boreall: You lose at least half the players if the rewards were only cosmetic I'd bet
[3:22:11] Powzoar: @Maximum Have you checked out SHogun yet? Its so good
[3:22:12] amafie: It's not even that Mythic is too difficult, it's that the time commitment is not viable for most people
[3:22:13] taanzfour: next thing would be that it should only give achievement
[3:22:15] Teraava: That's what FF does with the ultimates
[3:22:18] WingedChipmunk: @Maximum i wouldnt even say the cosmetic end works. The amount of complaints for the unique protodrake skins were wildly angry that it dropped on LFR
[3:22:19] gouldinglol: most heroic raiders are zooted in mythic gear anyway, thanks great vault
[3:22:19] phranq208: if you want to delete gear from M+ you might as well just delete gear from the game and template everyone
[3:22:21] Whitewolf1441: @Thdlock how else will i get 480 gear without ever touching mythic? :(
[3:22:23] Kooznik: Honestly believe if it wasnt mandatory 20 players to do mythic and was turned to 10man or even flex raiding after the RWF or after like 4-5 weeks of the tier. Many more people would be doing the content and completing it. The roster boss is just as hard for many guilds than the actual fights (besides a few). Also playing with 10-12 close friends and then 8 people who dont even speak on discord is just weird lol
[3:22:26] Wincrediboy: at the moment the gear problem is the gap in difficulty between H and M raid doesn't match the gap between H and +20s
[3:22:31] ItsToxicQT: Shogun IS FIR E
[3:22:31] xxpurplehazen: LOST BatChest
[3:22:31] baseboned: people still watch LOST?@???
[3:22:34] TommyC06wow: they need to go back to the icc version of nerfs every 2 weeks a 5% buff and thats the standard for each tier
[3:22:35] Treebuckett: Do you think this tiers gearing system is the best it's ever been for the greater playerbase?
[3:22:35] Shinaniganz: Shogun was filmed 10mins from my place
[3:22:37] dango0n: The bear goes hard af
[3:22:39] Mazmerized: why the switchup to lost 15 mins in?
[3:22:39] antipheonixna: what if mythic came out like 4 weeks later and all the early bosses for smolder level?
[3:22:46] baseboned: why would anyone watch Lost?
[3:22:48] beefy_cheez: i wish i could commit to a mythic raid schedule, but it's m+ only for me
[3:22:48] DanteDemonZ: is suki one of the doggos?
[3:22:48] Ultratide_: @Mazmerized adhd
[3:22:50] DocKal: max my wife is in LA, where should she eat
[3:22:52] iMeista: shogun  is dope but i hate weekly releases
[3:22:52] Whitewolf1441: @Wincrediboy someone once said that season is way easier than usual
[3:22:53] Rrainxoxo: lol make heroic BiS gear??? lol race to world first guilds bis in first 2 days with there heroic splits
[3:22:54] xxpurplehazen: LOST is an all time great
[3:22:54] DanteDemonZ: oh wait shes a person
[3:22:56] DanteDemonZ: nvm
[3:22:56] DragneelL9: Dunno, maybe a system where u can earn point from everything, but harder content gives more points. So mythic raiding would be fastest way to gear
[3:22:59] miraagex: @antipheonixna why?
[3:22:59] Singbeil: What happened with BDG?
[3:23:03] Powzoar: and then we explain why its the best
[3:23:04] m_dep: yeah did that with my wife
[3:23:04] bardabrax: imo best show ever made
[3:23:05] axetomouthh: Lost is so good
[3:23:05] CozyScaper: can confirm
[3:23:05] fronkacean: lost is a crazy show
[3:23:06] tanikins: LOL true on the lost watchers
[3:23:06] dango0n: LOST is actually really good
[3:23:09] Stauss: yeah i've seen craigslist posting for that
[3:23:10] m_dep: it was fun as fuck to watch her see the twists in real time
[3:23:11] vaerlyn: thats definitely a thing
[3:23:11] Powzoar: "This season was during hte writers strike"
[3:23:12] stryped: they need you to suffer just as they have
[3:23:15] axetomouthh: one of the best mystery shows of all time
[3:23:15] jesuslouise: @bardabrax YEP
[3:23:16] taanzfour: shes basically watching a real life in person reaction
[3:23:19] M0nkeys: I think the current loot system is absolutely perfect, but that's coming from a M+er
[3:23:25] pflipz: surprised you havent seen lost feels like something you would have been all over
[3:23:28] cheddabang24: @Maximum  anyone here can tell what happen to to BDG?
[3:23:29] skydollnoa: @dockal not in LA. depends on what food she wants too but never in LA for sure
[3:23:32] Patrikhg: if they tuned it down a little bit from the start it would target a way wider range of people. first 2 months alot of guilds have really slow progress
[3:23:33] dango0n: thats bait Max
[3:23:34] xxpurplehazen: Chatting
[3:23:34] baseboned: mysterious and good aren't the same thing
[3:23:37] Holytronic: I haven't watched it either.
[3:23:38] Lenzoface: kekw
[3:23:41] Boreall: Max after you finish watching Lost can I watch Lost with you? I've never seen it
[3:23:43] BigTrout3: that sounds something a Lost fan would post
[3:23:43] GrimFandango: yeah I made that CL post :)
[3:23:45] thefuntown: after season 1 i had to skip like 90% of the flashback parts, shit dragged on
[3:23:45] iamthegodcomplex: That's a murder advert
[3:23:49] NotoriousDruid: Lost fan seeking couch companion for binge watching.
[3:23:49] Goatsguffle: Ever heard of back page?
[3:23:51] gouldinglol: first-time reaction videos are huge on youtube
[3:23:54] Whitewolf1441: lost the show where people are stranded?
[3:23:54] baseboned: But that's cool you're doing that for her, good bf
[3:23:56] zettawill: Lost ending is as bad as GOT
[3:23:57] eeveejayy: "PS not a murderer"
[3:23:58] stumie: I wish I was born in the craigslist myspace era of the internet
[3:23:59] skydollnoa: @cheddabang24 check wowhead. theres an article
[3:24:04] antipheonixna: @miraagex more hard bosses but not a need to make harder bosses, and would could potentially be a cleaner race, no splits possibly more guilds
[3:24:20] Boreall: A nerf schedule would discourage many players from trying to clear it before it gets nerfed
[3:24:25] dango0n: has anyone checked in on dorki? is he still in mdi prison?
[3:24:26] LionButLeon: Pog
[3:24:26] Camelbak21: Shogun was amazing tbh, pleasantly surprised. Some scenes you can tell they didn't have the budget for, but that's nit picking, otherwise amazin
[3:24:32] JmantheThief: cut hall of fame down to 100 so you don't have to worry about waiting for hall of fame filling as long
[3:24:35] Pudzianos: I miss getting upgrades from last bosses
[3:24:36] BigTrout3: only cowards use the circle tool
[3:24:36] miraagex: @antipheonixna top guilds will still farm it. you don't realize how massive skill gap is.
[3:24:37] Florqt: ICC/Dragon Soul % buff/nerf system?
[3:24:40] Boreall: Are pies usually ovals?
[3:24:42] Kemplore: bad circle, redo it
[3:25:18] miraagex: us on tswift xdd
[3:25:23] gouldinglol: that's us on tindral last week
[3:25:26] xuu13: thats me in the small circle on tswift
[3:25:43] DocKal: nerf it like they did ICC back in the day?
[3:25:43] LionButLeon: catJAM
[3:25:45] RandaIFire: more minor nerfs instead of just swinging the massive hammer
[3:25:46] xuu13: @xuu13 pie
[3:25:48] antipheonixna: @miraagex top guilds will farm everything given to them, goal would be to smooth out end of heroic to early mythic and have more hard bosses but maybe mythic players just want their last couple bosses more than those goals
[3:25:54] Treebuckett: The 2 most recent boss nerfs got 300+ kills immediately after?
[3:25:54] fizzis_: man i cant imagine tswift before all these nerfs. we just got to him and dying 30sec into is wild lol
[3:25:57] nickis211: Fyrakk and tindral should have been nerfed way sooner, right after RWF ended
[3:26:01] PatientPlayer: the nerfs they apply are just too big they need to go slower. it goes from super hard to way to easy
[3:26:05] Treebuckett: Look at progstats
[3:26:07] Basic_3: They basically need to slow down Tindral by 15% to actually nerf it
[3:26:07] khebul: Raids for non-world first guilds has become extremely prep heavy. If you are not prepared to spend more time outside the raid styding, you are gonna have 500+ tindral prog
[3:26:13] SavageFromSpace: yeee, our guild got past phase 1 literally right before the nerf and it killed our guild
[3:26:14] AsapHorde: My guild was at 6-9% wipes on tindral and we killed Tindral BEFORE the 10% health and we felt SOO good Friday before the nerf.
[3:26:19] WingedChipmunk: This is the content I live for
[3:26:20] WingedChipmunk: ***
[3:26:29] lordsellia: Yeah. well my guild isnt your guild. The number of insta-wipe single mistake mechanics is way too insane
[3:26:32] Nico56400: I also have to say, everyone would take mythic raiding way more seriously if we couldn't drop gear from M+
[3:26:35] miraagex: @antipheonixna all difficulties at start, strongest win gg ez. stop being naive homie
[3:26:36] Ashille: I want the gear from raid (for m+), I want the difficulty from raid, but I don't to depend on 19 other person, hence I will never play wow again. And the only sad part about that is  that there is no other game with similar m+
[3:26:39] Wyvenn: Is Tindral the new Anduin?
[3:26:41] felmaden: do u think it was harder than jailer prenerf
[3:26:41] foghagymatyi: that 1 chinese guikld with a 1000 pull
[3:26:44] taanzfour: they just gave it bloodlust
[3:26:49] MorandoTv: its a morale thing too, my guild is stuck on tindral and the nerfs rejuvenated pulls on tuesday
[3:26:52] tanikins: the insta wipes on tindral are jump scares every time LOL
[3:26:54] pranders1: I killed tindral tonight first time, feels a bit shit we had him on 2% before nerf
[3:26:58] antipheonixna: @miraagex thats fine but thats the status quo
[3:27:02] loumblair: meanwhile were on smolderon...
[3:27:06] lolislawl5: SKYLINE showing people what determination is
[3:27:20] TirrinWoW: the biggest thing for my guilds morale was the lege dropping finally
[3:27:23] miraagex: @antipheonixna i would prefer to never raid any difficulty except mythic if it was possible. i have to hc/m+ for gearing
[3:27:26] xuu13: we almost killed tswift before the 5 sec seeds nerf and it just felt so bad, we just needed 1 or 2 more day to kill him
[3:27:27] TirrinWoW: nerfs didnt hurt either
[3:27:41] ogzauce: im just staring at my log in screen. Is today finally the day?
[3:27:48] Peber555: yeah, just sitting in silence is BEANS
[3:28:02] drchemtutor: describinhg our guild on smolderon rn, wipes- silence- go again
[3:28:07] Patrikhg: our guild is stuck at smolderon for like a month people cant dodge the flame tornados max Sadge
[3:28:21] baseboned: SAVAGE
[3:28:23] drchemtutor: biiiiig time
[3:28:23] discomancer1: DAYUM
[3:28:25] Goopy10: OUCH
[3:28:25] WhoAmIAgain_: HOLY
[3:28:25] baseboned: D:
[3:28:25] quarantedeux: silent pulls sadge
[3:28:27] GodKingMuninn: Do you think the Wotlk method of weekly dam/hp buffs would be good?
[3:28:27] Thatoneorangecd: Torhced
[3:28:34] GrimFandango: RIPBOZO
[3:28:34] maulinx: facts lmao
[3:28:37] Zandaloriann: @Patrikhg sus mnoPogf
[3:28:37] Boreall: Maximum have you ever considerd that naming a cat "Beans" is like naming your child "Fingers"
[3:28:40] sethron: gottem
[3:28:44] aFlyingGuru: wasd issue
[3:28:49] skydollnoa: silence is not good after a wipe imho
[3:28:50] lolislawl5: Yeah at some point smolderon isnt learning its just mechs
[3:28:52] maple_mage: maple_mage subscribed with Prime. 
[3:28:52] portleys: my guild's healer core is dooming hard af about fyrakk as we prog through it (me being part of that core)
[3:28:53] gfkoe: we took more pulls on council than nymue or larodar
[3:28:57] GodKingMuninn: My computer struggled to not set on fire on rashok. Rashok was such a struggle it killed my liquid cooler.
[3:28:57] baseboned: savage doesn't mean false, lmao
[3:28:59] miraagex: is it just me or larodar looks harder than smolderon
[3:29:03] dango0n: Im stuck trying to beat ante 8 with the black deck.
[3:29:10] baseboned: holy shit he made it worse
[3:29:14] Peber555: Low-roll guild Sadge
[3:29:15] pranders1: no, smolderon is worse than larodar imo
[3:29:16] Clush___: @Maximum before i gquit we were on smolderon for almost 400 pulls
[3:29:18] LionButLeon: catJAM 󠀀
[3:29:18] tanikins: @portleys us too (also part of healer core and RL)
[3:29:19] bigmeanbeefy: Turning the dabi coin tho, look at how many "new" speccs are  in the RWF
[3:29:22] TytanHere: worst is when raid lead and both tanks being officers addressing issues by saying yall do all the mistakes and we are here to fix them
[3:29:25] Mythdemeanor: NOTED guild.. is.. trash..
[3:29:27] baseboned: "low roll the people youre with" D: holy shit
[3:29:34] treesdesu: omg that goes hard
[3:29:40] mewlul: the same people who are failing to dodge smolderon are just going to die to fire beams on tindral
[3:29:41] Nixstatic: wtb those tips written down with visual pointers
[3:29:42] antipheonixna: @miraagex i get that and thats a fine world, the change im suggesting would hopefully give a more satisfying mythic kill of all the bosses for u but could be overall worse experience than what ur saying
[3:29:47] portleys: @tanikins lmao after this tier im never pressing my dispel button ever again
[3:29:47] fizzis_: YEP
[3:29:58] Tooyoo: give them externals also
[3:30:05] Tooyoo: i bet you the yolo guilds dont use externals
[3:30:06] fizzis_: we killed him last night. felt so much better when peopel get their shit right
[3:30:13] tanikins: @portleys i'm making this a sign to hold out front of blizzcon
[3:30:20] Tanadris: KYP: Know your personnel
[3:30:24] Basic_3: Guilds at that level have a hard time acknowledging that their worst players are so bad
[3:30:42] Team_Spanky: @Maximum how does it feel having more viewers right now than all of the viewers watching the World's First AAAA Game Skull and Bones?.... I tell ya what... thats why you get that sub every month.
[3:30:45] TommyC06wow: they need to go back to the icc version of nerfs every 2 weeks a 5% buff and thats the standard for each tier
[3:30:48] malnourish_: gotta keep eliminating variables
[3:30:48] skydollnoa: weakaura tutorials strat only can get u so far. ppl have to talk and discuss because not all raid comps are gonna be the same
[3:31:00] mikolaj96: @Maximum we are currently ~300 pulls deep into tindrall is fyrrak easier by any means?
[3:31:05] Razdruid: or they dont want to know
[3:31:06] oger421: it's called team work but some guilds to try to help improve their guildies
[3:31:13] Ashille: no people don't listen to timer at that level
[3:31:17] TheLoopsterr: actually good advice
[3:31:22] TommyC06wow: they need to go back to the icc version of nerfs every 2 weeks a 5% buff and thats the standard for each tier
[3:31:24] thegrt13: ja
[3:31:26] oger421: don't try*
[3:31:28] quarantedeux: sooo true, i have a boomie on /focus for the entire raid ready to cocoon him
[3:31:28] dango0n: YESSSS!!!
[3:31:30] Boreall: sure
[3:31:30] Razdruid: did you do a poddy c this week?
[3:31:34] iamthegodcomplex: no
[3:31:40] maulinx: i think saying they are so bad as a blanket statement is inaccurate, it's more about guilds being able to work around their player's weak points mechanically
[3:31:40] skydollnoa: hockey stream?
[3:31:54] LionButLeon: Susge
[3:31:55] skydollnoa: @maximum hockey stream when
[3:31:57] Wincrediboy: do you still have that in RWF guilds, or do you just expect everyone to be good so you don't have to plan around the player ability?
[3:32:05] Taytor: @Maximum im on a flush run where I just scored 10 mil inone hand
[3:32:07] lonelyknight1922: is it on steam?
[3:32:09] MBG_95: My issue is I get sucked into Flush builds too much
[3:32:18] Camelbak21: Was it initially a sponsored game?
[3:32:26] Zurro27: Blizzard should hire retired RWF raiders to make a mythic testing suicide squad
[3:32:32] Mythdemeanor: classic bm
[3:32:33] Basic_3: @maulinx Eh, as a person that is often 7/9 or 8/9, you do just have 15% of your group that sucks. You finish the fight after X pulls and you're doing it for 3X that waiting for them to get it.
[3:32:55] taanzfour: the double trouble
[3:33:00] taanzfour: wombo combo
[3:33:04] BigTrout3: i wish there was a random select
[3:33:19] Thatoneorangecd: You have me addicted to this game
[3:33:23] Boreall: just rip the green deck and get it out of the way
[3:33:27] quarantedeux: yellow is good for the early stakes
[3:33:34] BratBranko: nebula sounds cool
[3:33:35] BigTrout3: green just spends
[3:33:40] TheLoopsterr: IS THAT GAMBA
[3:34:19] periphrase: move cam?
[3:34:26] quarantedeux: @Maximum you can hold R on your keyboard to insta restart a run
[3:34:38] Boreall: middle right
[3:34:43] tanikins: yeah middle right
[3:35:03] treesdesu: I wanna gamba (but not really), sounds like my kind of game. peepoHappy
