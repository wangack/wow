[4:44:43] Collinawow: @Dypstyk9 Thats an opinion. I believe it would be better to buff the rest instead of nerfing 1 class to the ground. If 1 class is op (usually because of 1 skill) implent defensives on other classes to prevend it more.
[4:44:47] skymus: guys, these people are playing super defensive, not much constant damage is going out, and neither side is spam purging, of course their mana is going to be good.
