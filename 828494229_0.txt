[1:30:22] HaterManDude: Lots of no true scotsman fallacies, not supporting shroud if you dont watch twitch's shitty midroll ads that make the content worse. No one is here to watch cable TV which is what twitch is turning into.

[2:20:24] Notsolegendary: These wannabee kids in chat think that they know what being actually good at a game takes, they don't here a professional player who gets paid to play complaining maybe take a note and learn that you aren't that great and should follow suit and learn to listen
[2:20:25] Quantum733: @timegatex you mess around once the raid is cleared, not during progression
[2:20:27] GuyInTheTies: hey chat what do you think about mike blowing off some steam following this raid by playing some nice and relaxing escape from tarkov? its such a good way to destress after a long day

[2:34:48] coachy: @PsychsPK if you're gonna pick one over the other to play at endgame, keep those two factors in mind. If you want something challenging but dont have the time to invest, play Shadowlands. If you have the time to commit, play clasic

[2:40:32] StreamElements: Dungeons & Dragons is a structured yet open-ended role-playing game. When working together as a group, these player characters are often described as a "party" of adventurers, with each member often having their own area of specialty which contributes to the success of the whole. The results of the party's choices and the overall storyline for the game are determined by the Dungeon Master.

[3:05:54] dajerrius: yea that might be a reason
[3:05:54] bakedkayke: @shroud flask of chromatic res tell them to buy
[3:05:55] thegaymulatto: So much delicious salt
[3:05:57] dexgengames: I just wish I had friends to play wow with
[3:06:00] efthimi0s: @reggieledeux there's guild that have quit because it is 'too hard' lol
[3:06:01] yaamival: !subs
[3:06:04] Dankku: WHAT?! 6 PEOPLE? woah dude OMEGALUL
[3:06:05] MistakeNot_: TBH they're frustrated, but this is still an atmosphere condusive to learning I think
[3:06:06] Lorphex: i want to like wow but it looks so much like wizard 101 lmao
[3:06:08] green31OSU: @s9sam 4 horseman is pretty hard because it's all coordinated movement mechanics between all the raiders
[3:06:10] dajerrius: 40 people sounds quite annoying to ploay with
[3:06:11] johnmarstons: @nongmingnoodle lol ok?
[3:06:13] Double2XP: @stonednparanoid for real? lol
[3:06:13] Wreckful_7: maybe If people were actually geared an had more then 4k HP. people are already 175+ Item level just doing 2s
[3:06:14] koji_streams: Sweet cause I don’t know literally anything about the game but this looks fun as hell
[3:06:15] moochsan: how many bosses in this raid?
[3:06:15] kurib: I can imagine the mental burn out
[3:06:19] Death_Dono: 6 people raid what a joke KEKW
[3:06:21] lmask1: Last boss ?
[3:06:21] Xaser8: what % of these people did this back in the day prior to ez patch?
[3:06:23] CoreyCDL: What an unorganized, Salty huild
[3:06:24] yaamival: !subcount
[3:06:24] StreamElements: @yami411, his sub count is at least 1 shroudKEK
[3:06:25] Graeters: @shroud do you have a PO box? :)
[3:06:27] Dom3Sh0t: @koji_streams so much out there from the main grinders but I have more fun playing and doing my own shit
[3:06:29] makdaddyoo: @birdmangaming101 holy shit you are thick
[3:06:29] GHOST97915: @efthimi0s nax and AQ are known as guild breakers for a reason LULW
[3:06:31] nongmingnoodle: @johnmarstons classic right now is just boosters and raid loggers
[3:06:32] theslowtaco: None of these fights are hard! They have been beat for 15 years.
[3:06:35] gonn9o9: Stream time
[3:06:35] Darkbanore: @creamsvl when 1 person is causing like 15 people to die, which then causes the whole raid to wipe, being called out on that mistake isnt toxic, its just so they can make more progress :P
[3:06:37] theslowtaco: This is a joke
[3:06:41] Webby4u: Shroud playing world of warriors?
[3:06:43] hearthledgerlol: @efraginn y make stuff up
[3:06:43] Sheepanoid: @Xaser8 Easy patch? You must be thinking about Wotlk.
[3:06:46] johnmarstons: @nongmingnoodle sounds like you are on a dead server
[3:06:46] skippen1: @Its_NeO__ Nps mate, yeah it's a natural habitat to get defensive when getting called out for something you dissagree with, but its very common to happen in wow raiding culture imo
[3:06:48] Daks_Sugar_Daddy: how many wipes you at Shroud?
[3:06:49] AntoniusJD: @theslowtaco Anyone ask you?
[3:06:51] LightJoker30: !time

[3:06:54] hadarac1312: @theslowtaco u must be fun
[3:06:57] dajerrius: @everyone a bag of chips for me or a pickle or some tuna?
[3:06:59] Nekrono: most bosses in classic were tough because players back then sucked at mechanics like moving or cc in time because pc's ran raids at like 10 fps, player coordination should not be that hard especially after 13 years of gameplay lol
[3:07:00] Tribal_Gropher: i have no clue what is going on but its still cool to watch
[3:07:01] Dkbasedlord: !shroudcock
[3:07:01] vajoles: I’m back bro

[3:07:20] Darkbanore: @creamsvl Why not both ?!?!? Tuna chips AND pickle!
[3:07:22] 3lem0ns: @shroud why is this fight a joke??
[3:07:24] gonn9o9: !streamtime
[3:07:25] DrPhilUrGuts: nah lol this shoulda been done an hour ago yall mad
[3:07:27] koji_streams: @dom3sh0t yeah that’s what I see a lot online and what my cousin tells me

[3:07:49] WildParty: 4 ads ok
[3:07:50] theslowtaco: Imagine thinking 15 year old mechanics are hard
[3:07:51] reggieledeux: Fight actually does get hard at 40 percent
[3:07:52] gunsandrose: if you think this fight is a joke week1 into classic you havent played
[3:07:52] s9sam: @mrtoeknee oh really? ty I'll check vod
[3:07:53] dajerrius: @everyone im tempted on doing all of them
[3:07:58] GeneralAwe: ads every 20 mins...

[3:08:15] mrtoeknee: @s9sam yeah i think they had him about 10% first attempt
[3:08:17] nongmingnoodle: @johnmarstons also classic is filled with Bots, they should delete classic
[3:08:18] dajerrius: @everyone holy shit i have dark chocolate nvm
[3:08:18] mesut_cevhet: sa
[3:08:18] TheMythShow: remember to kill adds fast
[3:08:20] hadarac1312: @theslowtaco the only embarassing thing here is u commenting
[3:08:23] vajoles: Another ad bro
[3:08:24] twitch_jakes91: okay hold on
[3:08:24] gawddly: @rowdyrout troll

[3:09:02] Darkbanore: @gunsandrose The difference here is, it might be week one, but unlike vanilla week 1, the mechanics and strats are already known and have been for years now, its literally should be just like following a script
[3:09:02] nongmingnoodle: @johnmarstons to watch them rage when they wipe

[4:31:05] Thee21st: !936p
[4:31:05] StreamElements: @Thee21st, The reason why shroud streams at 936p is because twitch's bitrate cannot handle 1080p quality. 936p is better overall looking and quality wise than 1080p at the same bitrate.

[4:32:13] Hordiix: @NeuroDriveLP the majority of people definitely aren't doing mythic, but I find it pointless to compare the hardest difficulty of 1 game to a watered down easy version of another

[4:33:12] DemonicAvatar: @wildmongrel1 nope not watered down
[4:33:14] NeuroDriveLP: @Hordiix it's obvious that mythic is going to be harder than classic, it's natural but i think you should compare what most of ppl would be doing and not top tier raiders
[4:33:14] OceanlabTV: @shroud YOUR DPS NEEDS TO STOP AT 40% WAIT FOR MC'S TO GO OUT!!!

[7:16:51] gbonaro: !936p
[7:16:52] StreamElements: @Gbonaro, The reason why shroud streams at 936p is because twitch's bitrate cannot handle 1080p quality. 936p is better overall looking and quality wise than 1080p at the same bitrate.
