[0:57:57] Tomoglaziat: gonna piss off alot of players
[0:57:57] Bobka: would be weird
[0:57:58] WillowJane: maybe im on COPIUM but my guess is that if blizz hosts one, they'd just hire or have OTK peeps come and cast it
[0:57:58] reefo: yea you are so right, you should host a 21k tournament
[0:57:59] climbingviking: Esfand did stop playing season 2 of SOD....
[0:58:00] m00n4nds74r: it would be typical for blizzard to do this
[0:58:00] breakfastegg1: OTK shouldered all the risk and came up with the idea fuck blizz

[0:59:01] AxelFromAustralia: alextraza got a boob job in dragonflight thoughts?
[0:59:04] reefo: They aren't going to give up free publicity, if OTK has 100k tournament, that is only good for blizzard. blizz isn't going to make their own tourny if OTK is offering to do it for them

[1:00:23] carlos_dang3r: INTERVIEW @STREAMSNIPELUL ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED WITH THE OTK TOURNAMENT
[1:00:34] realmalfurionsr: Microsoft did that as a business practice since the 80s

[1:00:51] KadajjWoW: Its always like that with blizz... look Nostalgius then Classic
[1:00:52] DuoX: i just think otk is in a bad place image wise so blizzards likely pushing them away

[1:06:28] Karlton93: had issues with bfd near the last weeks but it makes sense
[1:06:29] iFennessey: pug on warrior or rogue

[1:12:15] linkitcraig: TBC was the same shit
[1:12:15] bindwounds: Just learned about that addon 2-3 weeks ago and yes that changed my life for sure
[1:12:16] madgarlicjr: OR.....just join a guild and play with your guildies
[1:12:17] DrDoomie: LFG Chat feels like looking at the matrix YEP
[1:12:17] einself111: damn can't imagine without it

[1:12:49] katarn231: "no changes, but it's ok to have servers with 5x the player count"
[1:13:04] Saynay: 20yo game doesnt have system to look for a group ICANT

[1:13:48] madgarlicjr: @Peoplewhinetoomuch same, i only play with my guild,
[1:13:48] bindwounds: @StaysafeTV Honestly i cant belive i played wow without this addon just made my life so much easier
[1:13:53] BleedzUK: they removed that from wrath and made it worst
[1:13:56] MAJORJOOGS: Yeah i didnt
[1:13:58] LoRswat: same company that gave us Party Chat...or w/e they called the Voice Coms from 15 years ago...that was dogshit, I don't think they'll do this
[1:14:02] dadbanger1: this just made my day
[1:14:04] DarkRavien13: i had no clue either
[1:14:14] DarkRavien13: think ima jump on my sod priest now
[1:14:18] Frank4LuLz: I QUIT SOD
[1:14:21] MAJORJOOGS: W Addon
[1:14:25] madgarlicjr: BAD TAKE
[1:14:34] TwoDancingLobsters: wow has different chats like city chat to interact with different groups
[1:14:47] madgarlicjr: taking to social aspect out of classic might as well go play retail
[1:15:13] reefo: @madgarlicjr it's not a social aspect, stop fooling yourself. it's full retard
[1:15:24] liceol: blizzard should just make balance
[1:15:31] Gurrehh: BASED
[1:15:31] katarn231: YEP
[1:15:33] NutterCircus: YEP
[1:15:35] sigilfish: that's me, ret paladin main BASED
[1:15:35] Nytsongx: the problem tho is that hunter is really good
[1:15:36] darthterac: but its zqo?
[1:15:37] Plokoon100: sure you can
[1:15:45] Saynay: i will not play melee hunter
[1:15:47] DrDoomie: @sigilfish KEKL
[1:15:51] wavecadet: @Nytsongx not ranged hunter
[1:15:59] StreetGen: @Nytsongx therefore there is a million of them
[1:15:59] madgarlicjr: make friends that will let you play ret paladin YEP
[1:16:01] TwoDancingLobsters: @StaysafeTV this is what people had been saying to ret pallies for years. go holy if u wanna raid etc
[1:16:03] Mr_Moffert: nooo you have to include my grey parsing shit geared rogue without worldbuffs and consumes
[1:16:03] ShieldMeh: some ppl cant lead tho
[1:16:04] liceol: maybe the devs shouldnt get payed when there are classees that are so bad they cannot raid
[1:16:09] RueRunsIt: is the SOD update today or tomorrow?
[1:16:25] NutterCircus: My current thing is Warriors tanking as Fury or arms... that cant stance dance. DansGame
[1:16:27] sigilfish: yeah, Esfand made it work
[1:16:28] TwoDancingLobsters: right, but dont expect people to want to take a ret
[1:16:33] DrDoomie: Ret isnt even bad in SoD right now
[1:16:45] 5thD5thD: YEP
[1:16:46] iMattbat: Crowd pummeler go brrrr
[1:16:49] madgarlicjr: my guild on era has one ret and hes a chad and hes cool af and does the loot EZ
[1:16:51] Saynay: sure i will go out my way to play the game that is piss low ez coz of insecure ppl
[1:16:57] TwoDancingLobsters: were talking about in the history of classic, not recently in sod
[1:17:07] Xephyr282: cmonBruh
[1:17:20] Sunderwire_: LUL
[1:17:24] Mind_G0bl1n: unless ur going for rank1 u dont need coms
[1:17:27] NutterCircus: Asmons best content has been shitty raids. Who remembers GUS?
[1:17:28] awp_og: it’s still sad that People wants only ultra giga op class
[1:17:29] CannonM2K: Malding
[1:17:32] carlos_dang3r: guess what other system accommodates those people... GDKPs :)
[1:17:33] AxelFromAustralia: ranged hunter does more dps now anyway @staysafetv
[1:17:39] TwoDancingLobsters: true
[1:17:49] DrDoomie: I know some people who were getting baited into horrible groups first week of gnomer yeah
[1:17:53] Saynay: maybe in US u dont clear LOL
[1:17:55] linkitcraig: @carlos_dang3r BASEDRETARD
[1:17:59] JoeBangles_: I have pugged every lockout 6/6 but I'm a healer so ymmv
[1:18:05] Deamp: ohh yeah loot locked, so i can clear the content multiple times parsing?
[1:18:21] madgarlicjr: YEP
[1:18:26] xxjonn80xx: xxjonn80xx subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 29 months!

[1:18:35] mrbeggin89: Cleared all my gnomes, puggin casual dad gamer
[1:18:38] Quickish: Trump had an amazing speech today. Very inspirational, and it continues to excite me for the future of THE United Sates of America. Amen.
[1:18:41] Mr_Moffert: maby i dont want to spend hours in a raid that should only take 30-40 minutes with a non retarded grp
[1:18:47] N_Tys: particularly when Asmon was doing it himself for years. not sure why he's surprised.
[1:18:49] brady_crazy0: I don't even think uve killed LK, u can't really give an opinion on whether game is easy or not
[1:18:49] Mind_G0bl1n: @Quickish TTrump
[1:19:02] Ropy123: LUL
[1:19:14] give_me_a_1_in_chat: no bc sod isnt classic
[1:19:14] Saynay: if u vote for trump ur literally brain rot
[1:19:17] jameserush1: what does that mean
[1:19:18] AxelFromAustralia: way better
[1:19:23] AcheronV: Selling runs
[1:19:24] bindwounds: @StaysafeTV i think it would be better
[1:19:24] LiquidGrizz: yea
[1:19:26] 5thD5thD: people would sell carries
[1:19:26] N_Tys: yes
[1:19:27] Mawshaw: Fuck no NOPERS I don't want it like retail NOPERS
[1:19:27] fartguyl: boosting
[1:19:28] StreetGen: yes, youll be refillingyour group after every boss
[1:19:29] Atb50: yes
[1:19:31] KerriKaoz: groups would disband after 1 wipe
[1:19:31] LiquidGrizz: carry runs
[1:19:32] tussmack: people would abandon raids that struggle much more
[1:19:35] VenomVeinZ: people would drop out after the boss they wanted loot for @StaysafeTV
[1:19:35] Sourr09: groups would disband too if you got your boss in for boss 3
[1:19:36] SloMo904: loot lock where you repeat bosses is going to be boosted nonstop
[1:19:39] einself111: i really dont want that
[1:19:48] torandre89: it would become super toxic
[1:19:50] reefo: bad idea imo, everyone quits after the boss they need, or if the group is underperforming
[1:19:52] NutterCircus: I literally do that for free for guild mates.
[1:19:54] StreetGen: @StaysafeTV Youll constantly have to fill groups
[1:20:04] CygnusC: they can already do that
[1:20:07] 3verythingatonce: people drop after the boss they want anyway
[1:20:07] Fredmonroe11: how is that different than now?
[1:20:08] give_me_a_1_in_chat: but then you invite soemone who isnt locked to the next
[1:20:17] reefo: they can, but they aren't incentivized
[1:20:20] RueRunsIt: where’s the blue post about Xp again?
[1:20:24] papa_squat123: yup
[1:20:25] DrDoomie: Yep
[1:20:29] linkitcraig: can u ML if you're loot locked though
[1:20:30] LiquidGrizz: yea that's best
[1:20:34] AxelFromAustralia: make a reputation with rewards that you get from bosses each reset so people don’t do that @staysafetv
[1:20:44] DuoX: or Sod is fine lol
[1:20:51] LiquidGrizz: @AxelFromAustralia rep from bosses is a good system yea
[1:20:53] SpikedSahjahAngel: if it doesn't drop, they leave anyways
[1:20:54] DrDoomie: Thats why I put together my own group with some friends, we pug maybe 1-2 people if needed
[1:21:27] AxelFromAustralia: rep or a quest that requires a drop from bosses, like in retail; 50 of those charges to get a helm enchant so people do the raid regardless of boss drops
[1:21:39] Nyk_Wyld: HeyGuys sstvLOVE
[1:21:43] Cluzza: i miss the old asmongold
[1:21:55] SolanarTV: @Cluzza what do u mean
[1:22:02] SloMo904: just make it boss lockouts, so 4/6 people can join other 4/6 groups
[1:22:03] madgarlicjr: its almost as if the game was created for people to make sacrifices for "FRIENDS" not strangers incentivizing people to play with the same people aka"friends" not random people every raid.
[1:22:05] DuoX: i feel like the player is not playing in good faith being something that isn't good.
[1:22:10] JoeBangles_: Shamans GIGACHAD
[1:22:20] give_me_a_1_in_chat: thats not a sod exclusive thing. if you play a dogshit as a pure dps then play the better spec
[1:22:21] KKonaStevieG: ain't first your last YEP
[1:22:23] DrDoomie: Its a 1g max respec cost too though so
[1:22:29] NutterCircus: Shaman PVP is stupid good.
[1:22:31] papa_squat123: horde has it so good right now...shamans are way better than pallies wtf
[1:22:41] bryggx: is it really necessary to have all the classes and specs perfectly balanced at all time?
[1:22:43] JoeBangles_: Shamans GIGACHAD
[1:22:48] Mawshaw: If they add loot lockout they'd probably add personal loot next, and I REALLY don't want that
[1:22:49] Ropy123: LUL
[1:22:50] Vulkric: Vulkric subscribed at Tier 1. 
[1:22:52] Metaphix: well no shit
[1:22:56] reefo: @bryggx to some extent yes
[1:22:56] its_Blocky: because runes are trash.. runes should enable builds, not be straight damage like chaos bolt, SW death, etc
[1:23:19] tussmack: alot of it is just be the right class/spec, people are meta slaves
[1:23:25] big_stape_: my favorite is
[1:23:28] AxelFromAustralia: loot lockout requires personal loot tho, otherwise people can trade you the gear even if you’re locked
[1:23:28] pepesmokez: "Big dam ez trust"
[1:23:29] big_stape_: ROGUE WITH CONSUMES CAN KICK
[1:23:32] Provenskill: definitely checking logs
[1:23:40] NutterCircus: They invite you if you are prepped
[1:23:52] hairfair88: @GuildMM Thnx for the sub man. :)
[1:23:56] csjustin: i have social anxiety and dont know how to raid lead
[1:23:56] 5thD5thD: KEKW
[1:23:56] breakfastegg1: as a rogue runes actually restrict builds. you have to be mutilate daggers for both pve and pvp
[1:23:56] JoeBangles_: {moon} Furry Boomkin pumper uwu with worldbuffs uwu and consumes uwu {moon}
[1:23:58] torandre89: "Pumper rogue with LW/wbs/consumes and nades. Know all strats"
[1:24:00] StreetGen: ar oni/t
[1:24:01] TurboBased: GIGACHAD discriminate
[1:24:04] TheEndIsNear777: i want to raid lead but then that means i have to KNOW the raids to teach the noobs so we can clear it :(
[1:24:05] katarn231: I love discriminating
[1:24:08] bone555: Just like real life KEKW
[1:24:15] Mr_Moffert: Sadge but doing things take effort
[1:24:15] AxelFromAustralia: dog eat dog world
[1:24:31] TheEndIsNear777: im too lazy :(
[1:24:34] whyknee: kevaffFocus hexeTail
[1:24:34] yaboiash1: this is true
[1:24:34] NutterCircus: You make friends doing your own raids. Sometimes a bad raid is still fun. EleGiggle
[1:24:35] nemcoy: I have 95+ logs and I get rejected by grey loggers, its wild
[1:24:35] xxjonn80xx: sstvWAT
[1:24:38] reefo: @TheEndIsNear777 you can watch guides, and rely on other people in the group to have more knowledge and that is ok
[1:24:39] TwoDancingLobsters: @StaysafeTV people in SoD cant even be bothered to wait for the group to form
[1:24:40] wavecadet: its only 10 man
[1:24:42] JoeBangles_: People want to queue up LFR and AFK until it pops up accept
[1:24:43] wavecadet: its really easy to do
[1:24:44] LiquidGrizz: or just find a guild
[1:24:45] Provenskill: why be ruled when you can rule - Marcus Aurelius
[1:24:51] yaboiash1: i leveled my warrior in TBC making my own groups had WF every time

[1:34:21] atlasglassstudio: GOOD AFTERNOON FATHER
[1:34:27] mortis_1: yes because its impossible to design an MMO around how every single person plays
[1:34:31] Mind_G0bl1n: the way they decoupled WoW UI from client API is one of the biggest reasons its the best MMO
[1:34:33] NutterCircus: Yes!
[1:34:33] DrDoomie: MY BAG ADDONS WHYYY
[1:34:34] g0dzilla: sod without addons could be possible
[1:34:37] einself111: NOPERS i like dmg meter Sadge

[1:34:43] SolanarTV: @mortis_1 completely not the point
[1:34:45] Waacka_: same
[1:34:46] Lava_in_a_Lamp: damage and healing meters should be part of the normal UI
[1:34:46] Metaphix: why even play yeah
[1:34:47] einself111: same
[1:34:47] NeoSpy: 80% people will leave game
[1:34:47] EzPickenz1: X questie
[1:34:48] reefo: i wouldn't play

[1:34:51] father_ruckus_: ui addons are the only thing i couldnt go without
[1:34:52] plddn: it’s in my mind cheating having weak auras beep bing and bong whenever an ability is happening
[1:34:53] Metaphix: i want to see personal progress
[1:34:53] Atb50: me to
[1:34:56] Masterless: u can look at logs still

[1:34:57] novvum: Same
[1:35:04] caffeinated_zombee: I wonder how many add ons asmond uses?
[1:35:07] SupreemLeeder11: WTFF no dmg meter = who's pulling their weight?
[1:35:10] OhMyMookie: OhMyMookie subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 15 months, currently on a 7 month streak! why is the baldman mad we are using addons. hello CHAT
[1:35:10] Mr_Moffert: NODDERS

[1:35:14] imheremortall: k1m6a1010
[1:35:18] dirbagdan: tbh d be fine with the removal of all addons if they had certain f eatures like threat and dps charts built in
[1:35:24] warrenny: logs do that
[1:35:26] NeoSpy: there is literally no reason to raid more than once if no dps matters
[1:35:27] OhMyMookie: MUCH LOVE
[1:35:28] Metaphix: blizzard could make their own dmg meter
[1:35:34] SupreemLeeder11: dmg meter absolute must or you dont know who's pulling their weight or afk
[1:35:36] father_ruckus_: they could do that,  if you only had access to your dmg,  not the combat logs
[1:35:38] dirbagdan: @warrenny an addon captures the data...
[1:35:39] TheEndIsNear777: I only want to raid for gear
[1:35:42] TheEndIsNear777: Gib me the loots

[1:35:54] reefo: a year ahead so everyone quits, great idea
[1:35:55] novvum: People will quit
[1:35:57] tehCharo: Damage meters and/or Warcraft Logs suck when you're   the guy doing mechanics and still being compared to the people who don't do mechanics, "Why don't you do more damage than top <spec> on WCL?" because they're tunneling boss and you're running around doing shit, it feels bad
[1:36:01] Provenskill: WoW is dead af without addons lol
[1:36:03] atlasglassstudio: id quit so fast
[1:36:04] Nonprophetx: that just does to show how important damage meters are that people would quit if they couldnt see how they perform vs others
[1:36:05] abruptdecayO_O: wait what
[1:36:06] Mind_G0bl1n: L Take
[1:36:07] abruptdecayO_O: why
[1:36:10] Nonprophetx: game isnt even fun then at that point
[1:36:10] reefo: it's not going to happen and it's a stupid idea

[1:36:31] AmarokUnchained: AoC is goiing to not  allowing addons
[1:36:34] Ropy123: @tehCharo 99% of players have no idea how parses work
[1:36:40] dirbagdan: addons like weak auras and other shit to remind you when to click spells or do a mechanic shouldnt exist
[1:36:43] Maxifrog: Why limit macros, I like figuring those out

[1:36:58] osopolar1977: ohhhhhh
[1:37:01] Munchagramz: any highlights in the YT vids timeline you can skip to?
[1:37:07] dirbagdan: @warrenny i thought you needed the WCL addon to cap[ture the data and upload it. I get its just raw data but the capture of it requires something does it not?
[1:37:17] dinkleminkle: holy shitta were watching three streamer povs
[1:37:26] dirbagdan: @dinkleminkle react maxxing
[1:37:28] abruptdecayO_O: the journal was atloos loot

[1:38:16] Mind_G0bl1n: why would they take on more work and slow down their projects?
[1:38:16] Kawatteruwow: deleting combat addons is the first step
[1:38:16] Metaphix: they they could control what you could put on there
[1:38:17] TheEndIsNear777: @g0dzilla :)
[1:38:22] dtl78: if they dont implement zoneman i dont want it

[1:38:31] Provenskill: cant you do all that shit in FF these days or am i coping?
[1:38:32] dirbagdan: @warrenny i just show up and zug lol. I just always remember the raid leads calling out asking if we were logging on speed runs and stuff

[1:40:21] wavecadet: YEP
[1:40:22] iMattbat: LUL
[1:40:22] timeoutandy: agree
[1:40:32] AxelFromAustralia: that’s someone’s stepdad
[1:40:34] TheEndIsNear777: yes warcraft logs is good :)
[1:40:40] timeoutandy: spending 3 hours in gnomer and then having to disband cuz not checking logs not worth
[1:40:40] DrDoomie: As the token bomb warlock of my group all I can say is KEKW
[1:40:42] breakfastegg1: they go 5/6 LUL all this video proved is why you vet people
[1:40:42] wavecadet: the video tried to be anti log but it just reinforces that this is meta for a reason OMEGALUL
[1:40:45] dirbagdan: tbh you dont even need a log to explain to that guy how he fucked up. It's wuite evident LUL
[1:40:59] novvum: warcraft logs can be good
[1:41:00] novvum: and bad
[1:41:04] TwoDancingLobsters: if only
[1:41:08] g0dzilla: @TheEndIsNear777 has pros and cons... not good overal
[1:41:12] handpickedbytim: monkaHmm someone should make a leaderboard
[1:41:14] imheremortall: LUL
[1:41:14] DrDoomie: You can literally make a macro to 1shot the bombs without even having to target them manually
[1:41:15] eyonixz: the point was he invited people to just have fun not parse
[1:41:15] LiquidGrizz: almost like a score out of 100
[1:41:18] Munchagramz: or if on an alt
[1:41:19] Nonprophetx: if the content was hard enough to care i could see why it would matter
[1:41:20] g0dzilla: @novvum agree
[1:41:24] Ropy123: @g0dzilla mostly cons
[1:41:26] wavecadet: phase 1
[1:41:27] Nonprophetx: these guys are all doing phase 1 dps
[1:41:28] TheEndIsNear777: @g0dzilla i was thinking in the sense of, 1 hour raid vs 6 hour raid, its good for that XD
[1:41:32] Nonprophetx: still clearing it
[1:41:34] R1CH4RD00M: After playing a similar MMORPG where addons are ''banned'' FFXIV i realised that all top end raider are using them even those its banable they are just not streaming it and most of them are overlay and undetectable. Having them public at least give the option for blizard to ban certain interaction when its too op like the did with the mythic archimonde radar for example.
[1:41:35] 94explorer: wcl is great; anyone saying theyre not are dogshit and should make their own group where you can regulate who comes
[1:41:36] timeoutandy: people who complain about logs could just join a guild or create their own non log checked run and spend the time they want LUL
[1:41:37] its_Blocky: this is fine Clueless
[1:41:37] Mr_Moffert: monkaLaugh this is fine
[1:41:37] papa_squat123: KEKW
[1:41:41] Mr_Moffert: entire room on fire
[1:41:46] LiquidGrizz: ziqo wont hit bombs? lol
[1:41:46] DrDoomie: Real life meme LUL
[1:41:46] TwoDancingLobsters: everything on fire > this is fine
[1:41:48] handpickedbytim: bogaFine
[1:41:49] dirbagdan: This is fine
[1:41:53] StueartTV: i feel like joining a guild solves all the problems mentioned
[1:42:03] AxelFromAustralia: but the raid is easy? we one shot first reset every boss but last 2 and needed less than 10 attempts to beat boss
[1:42:05] Munchagramz: listen just dont touch fire, no issue
[1:42:07] DrDoomie: Holy shit OMEGALUL
[1:42:09] TwoDancingLobsters: it reallt does stueart
[1:42:10] g0dzilla: @TheEndIsNear777 still bad for player without experience... its only good for some...
[1:42:10] SupreemLeeder11: KEKL joke
[1:42:12] LiquidGrizz: just shoot the bombs lol
[1:42:16] dirbagdan: the slow zoom in OMEGALUL
[1:42:17] lerler: and this is why you look at logs
[1:42:17] timeoutandy: video only showing why u need to check logs LUL
[1:42:20] Metaphix: KEKL
[1:42:32] 94explorer: @g0dzilla ppl without experience should join a non experience group no?
[1:42:33] SloMo904: spent 3 hours to go 5/6
[1:42:38] wavecadet: x to doubt
[1:42:41] TheEndIsNear777: @g0dzilla oh yea i forget there is new players :( wow been out so long i thought everyone that already played, had played before :(
[1:42:41] dirbagdan: @StaysafeTV I'd rather attend your gnomer from the other night than this LUL
[1:42:44] grizz430: sweaty doesnt equal good

[1:42:59] keyboardwarrior32: retard
[1:43:02] Nonprophetx: its easy for the average person but there will always be really bad players
[1:43:03] GodKingMuninn: 1 man person can ruin it for all
[1:43:03] AxelFromAustralia: it’s easier than LFR raid in retail literally
[1:43:06] DrDoomie: Im not gonna lie, phase 2 has REALLY shown me that there are some people who cant use half their brain
[1:43:06] Plokoon100: Imagine tryin to just play the game for the experiance lol
[1:43:10] g0dzilla: @94explorer so the non experienced group only clears 3/6 and cant learn to go further? doesnt make sens...
[1:43:12] TwoDancingLobsters: its always been hard for people that cant look at threat meters or DBM
[1:43:14] LiquidGrizz: it's too hard and too easy!
[1:43:19] timeoutandy: was nice spending a lockout for 5/6 sure Kappa
[1:43:19] calico_acid: lots of sweaty retards
[1:43:20] LiquidGrizz: he needs more blankets and less blankets!
[1:43:27] Metaphix: we didnt get the best loot but at least they were nice guys FeelsStrongMan
[1:43:28] 94explorer: @g0dzilla youre not good enough to go further? what lmao

[1:47:08] DeadDawg68: it was like a really bad movie, that you just can't stop watching
[1:47:09] wavecadet: since they didnt kill last boss lmao
[1:47:12] grizz430: some of my best raiding memories, and some of the best friends I've made in the game were in scuffed ass raids. The game doesnt need to be monkey-parse brain all the time.
[1:47:15] Metaphix: "done"
[1:47:17] Mind_G0bl1n: salty
[1:47:36] vice_9: imagine rejecting ziko and not knowing it was him lol
[1:47:38] gambleragain: i dont understand the video tho, he tried to make a point of log checking andies, and yet fails to kill the last boss @StaysafeTV
[1:47:43] breakfastegg1: BatChest
[1:47:45] g0dzilla: @94explorer why me? its not about me bro... its about wow and the community... and you cant denie that everybody wants to clear 6/6...
[1:47:49] reefo: ya i'd be pissed that he didn't check logs
[1:47:53] TwoDancingLobsters: yea the "log checking andies" stayed to clear it
[1:47:56] dirbagdan: IF YOU AIN'T FIRST, YOU'RE LAST KKona
[1:48:00] Robglobgubob: I enjoyed gnomer but I hated how casters run out of mana. ran it as a healer and it sucked a lot of fun out of the encounter
[1:48:12] Mr_Moffert: log checkers keep winning
[1:48:17] 94explorer: @g0dzilla for sure, but that doesnt mean ppl get to just cause they want to no?
[1:48:27] ichewbubblegumm: log checkers can't keep getting away with this
[1:48:29] linkitcraig: Chatting
[1:48:42] reefo: @Robglobgubob you didn't click the button often enough, or your group didn't kill fast enough. just need more gear
[1:48:43] TwoDancingLobsters: his pug group disbanded but the log group went 6/6 even if they finished later working on the final boss. Their healers stayed to put in the effort
[1:48:51] DuoX: wow doesn't have trouble with making groups though , its totally fine
[1:49:02] wavecadet: yeah safe room is cringe
[1:49:08] gambleragain: @g0dzilla then find likeminded people who want to progress, some people want to go in clean run, get out
[1:49:10] Robglobgubob: we cleared it but I hate long fights
[1:49:15] breakfastegg1: wiping is so devastating on classic. takes like 10+ minutes to pull again
[1:49:18] nearoz123: thats your punishment for dying
[1:49:20] ichewbubblegumm: bro the teleporter is fine lol
[1:49:23] Mr_Moffert: yea but teleporter only took you to gelehast
[1:49:24] fartguyl: still had to run after tele though in bfd
[1:49:25] timeoutandy: why does everyone have to pull up paint for trying to explain or showcase a solution that requires 15sec of normal speech
[1:49:28] Munchagramz: gran blue fantasy relink
[1:49:29] bindwounds: @StaysafeTV SoD need summoning stone to , not enough warlocks :P
[1:49:32] Munchagramz: basicly ff
[1:49:36] yoozernaim: ayaya
[1:49:39] mikyki: weeb shit
[1:49:41] reefo: wipe recovery is fine in gnomer
[1:49:53] vice_9: honkai impact is what he playing
[1:49:53] fartguyl: @reefo agreed
[1:49:55] g0dzilla: @94explorer i dont understand ur point... im saying its retarded to only take 6/6 exp player into ur group and check logs...
[1:50:02] OhMyMookie: yeah thats how it works asmon....
[1:50:05] TwoDancingLobsters: @timeoutandy hes working through the through process. writing it down helps
[1:50:11] OhMyMookie: 100%
[1:50:17] TwoDancingLobsters: the thought*
[1:50:17] OhMyMookie: there has to be risk and reward
[1:50:19] Jazzarus_: yeah, the punishment is wiping, lmao

[1:50:20] Dillsmof: World buffs are dog shit tho
[1:50:26] FrankYE1990: how tf u cant clear this raid im pugging it with only rnd since week one we cleard it everytime
[1:50:31] Tomo665: raid problem: you have to play the video game
[1:50:35] Jazzarus_: you died and didnt get loot, that's the punishment right there
[1:50:42] oakenempire: cthun wipes :(
[1:50:46] D3FT: true
[1:50:47] mickster111: true

[1:50:48] Robglobgubob: true
[1:50:50] crovenkb: summoning inside the instace?
[1:50:52] linkitcraig: @oakenempire at least there was a teleporter for c'thun
[1:50:53] gambleragain: @g0dzilla It's not. You're just bad and don't understand why people do that. I wan a smooth run and investing time in finding people is easier for me than investing time to progress hte fight.
[1:50:54] thatquidproquo: Like Heroic Lich King, 5-10min recovery
[1:50:55] g0dzilla: @gambleragain and how long should i look for a group to find those? 20hr?
[1:50:58] 94explorer: @g0dzilla and the only reason youre saying that, as i understand, is because you feel entitled to get into those groups with no experience/no skill (logs) correct?
[1:51:00] crovenkb: lol nvm
[1:51:00] Provenskill: fuck it, make it like retail and just spawn at the boss lol
[1:51:02] zaebot3000: Yes you can
[1:51:06] paulwow777: LUL
[1:51:12] iSzy300: surly buffing and running to the clean room can be done...
[1:51:13] TwoDancingLobsters: people NEEDING to go 6/6 is a problem. In Classic OG my guild didnt clear BWL
[1:51:15] zaebot3000: You can summon inside of instance
[1:51:20] Metaphix: you did roll on pvp LUL
[1:51:22] grizz430: there are PvE servers
[1:51:24] timeforpoe: why is fucking asmos making a vid if he doesnt even play
[1:51:25] CrusaderNero: a summon stone would be nice tbh

[1:51:42] reefo: @TwoDancingLobsters most people dont want to suck, and actually see all the content
[1:51:44] SloMo904: because of raid id's need someone to waste their 0/6 lockout to join a 5/6 run
[1:51:50] timeoutandy: out to in just like my mouth :)

[1:52:09] Ropy123: @keyboardwarrior32 it sounds so stupid KEKW
[1:52:09] gambleragain: @g0dzilla Your issue. Take as long as it takes. If you don't want to be better at the game to play with better players than you're gonna take longer until you find those people that are gonna invite you. It's not my job as a player to carry bad players.
[1:52:26] g0dzilla: @94explorer still isnt about me...
[1:52:30] Jazzarus_: yeah, that's why raid ids are stupid. Boss or loot Id is better
[1:52:39] 94explorer: @g0dzilla ight ur a moron, tried my best to communicate gl brother
[1:52:44] Metaphix: nah RPG's are all about the sick loot
[1:52:45] TwoDancingLobsters: @reefo so dont suck? again if you cant get 6/6 dont cry about it. we didnt clear raids when we were 15yo playing the game. It needs to be ok to not see all the content
[1:52:47] Munchagramz: i like to raid when i got friends
[1:52:48] wavecadet: yeah thats cuz they like YOU
[1:52:48] jameserush1: I would raid to parse
[1:52:50] Lighterio: individual boss lockouts already exists in retail. just reuse it
[1:52:52] dirbagdan: YEP
[1:52:54] jameserush1: to try and higher parses
[1:52:56] Herturn: I want to keep practicing to get a perfect parse :)
[1:52:59] lilkreamys: i would just to parse and stuff
[1:52:59] linkitcraig: it's a redflag when u see 'LF1M healer - last boss only'
[1:53:00] timeoutandy: streamer benefits :)
[1:53:00] zebulous: Ive done that in retail
[1:53:01] iSzy300: idd
[1:53:03] reefo: @TwoDancingLobsters it's not ok, and you do suck if you can't 6/6
[1:53:03] keyboardwarrior32: way lower drop rates and allow for multiple raids/no lockout
[1:53:03] lizcat_: true
[1:53:03] imwicktv: There would just be carry runs
[1:53:03] Munchagramz: its fun to help friends
[1:53:07] grizz430: they would just spam sell runs then
[1:53:12] imwicktv: Selling loot and so on
[1:53:16] therealthracian: shutup asmond
[1:53:16] Plokoon100: MAGE
[1:53:17] bindwounds: NO just make summoning stones
[1:53:18] NotDessx: Noone is talking about having loot locked people means less loot dropping @staysafetv
[1:53:19] TwoDancingLobsters: @reefo its like seeing a warrior with hand of rag and your guild cant clear MC, it means more to people
[1:53:19] bindwounds: Goddammit
[1:53:19] LiquidGrizz: disagree
[1:53:19] DrDoomie: Warlock summon stone kind of solves that
[1:53:21] matthewz92: classic devs at the end of sod will burn out and just stick to fresh vanilla, because redesigning classic wow is too much work

[1:53:32] higgin96: @StaysafeTV Are you playing Cata? Just curious
[1:53:33] Jazzarus_: I do that in retail where you can fight bosses again. Some fights are just fun to do. That could happen in SoD too.
[1:53:34] helloiamlucas: activate the sum stones
[1:53:34] gambleragain: There's 4 reasons people raid. 1-Loot 2-Speedrun. 3-Parse 4- Being completely wasted and take 5 hours to clear gnomer. @StaysafeTV
[1:53:36] Ropy123: :O
[1:53:39] timeoutandy: LUL
[1:53:40] daijahaden: Wouldn't no raid limit just mean people no life the shit out of it, hit BIS within a week and quit the game quicker.

[1:54:00] g0dzilla: @gambleragain this sentence "its not my job as a player to carry bad players" is the problem... ur attitude is totaly wrong for a game wher socialism and teamwork is nessesary... ur just thinking selfish... persons like u are the issue...
[1:54:04] pastterino: warlocks could do mage things with soul shards instead, it kinda works
[1:54:07] jasonbriggs: no changes

[1:54:16] pastterino: maybe a sacrifice, warlock makes a portal but he also dies KEKW
[1:54:17] Ervill1: tank warlock and mage healer, but summoning warriors is too crazy Kappa
[1:54:17] Jazzarus_: it's annoying af, and they're rude, like you HAVE to do it
[1:54:19] mortis_1: same
[1:54:19] lilkreamys: i know people who made a GROSS amount of gold start if p2 from summons
[1:54:19] therealthracian: they gave us a item to use shard spells w no shard needed 5 min cd
[1:54:22] DrDoomie: Because I was charging 4g to put down a summon stone in the beginning of phase 2
[1:54:24] Munchagramz: when your building raids its nice
[1:54:25] swaee: i got whispers the second i hit 20
[1:54:26] Robglobgubob: I ignore all non guild summon requests on my lock
[1:54:27] jameserush1: I hate leeches who don’t come to instance themselves just cause I’m in the group

[1:54:30] TwoDancingLobsters: LUL
[1:54:32] Mr_Moffert: noway
[1:54:35] therealthracian: dude ppl always bitching stfu n play the game
[1:54:49] Herturn: exactly
[1:55:02] Ropy123: Blizzard "designed" nothing, they just threw a bunch of shit in game hopping it makes sense
[1:55:07] Herturn: @therealthracian therealthracian: dude ppl always bitching stfu n play the game
[1:55:08] gambleragain: @g0dzilla Again. If i can clear the raid in 35 min with good players and social players as well. I'd choose these players over a good guy who sucks.
[1:55:23] therealthracian: im havin a blast in sod
[1:55:28] Jazzarus_: @Ropy123 well, you just described design LUL
[1:55:32] Metaphix: unless you pay my sub then STFU EZ
[1:55:36] Mr_Moffert: BASEDRETARD im having fun, stop being eletist
[1:55:36] grizz430: but you do realize that playing optimally would be boomies using wild growth though? or locks using CoR
[1:55:38] Xephyr282: Pepega
[1:55:39] DrDoomie: Especially if you dont know if these people are going to run with you next lockout and get better or keep loot in your raid
[1:55:39] iSzy300: if that happens then it deserves to be a gdkp and i should get gold for the run
[1:55:40] TwoDancingLobsters: so the ret pally in classic delima
[1:55:41] reefo: if you are here to have fun, play with other ppl who want to have fun, dont waste my time with your 'fun' cause i'm not having fun then
[1:55:46] B_P_Richfield: Sounds like the gamer dads in my wrath guild :(
[1:55:46] zebulous: Doing that is fine but you need to like have a friend group of like minded people
[1:55:48] g0dzilla: @gambleragain selfish and wrong in a gaame like wow
[1:55:55] derty93: melee mage sounds sick tho
[1:56:01] Ropy123: @Jazzarus_ so, in your head, thats how designing a game works?
[1:56:10] gambleragain: @g0dzilla Funny you say that, while telling me how to play the game myself.
[1:56:13] pastterino: I would love to make a cheesy comp, go there and don't care about loot.
[1:56:31] ScarfaceCEO: 5Head
[1:56:36] Jazzarus_: @Ropy123 Not in my mind, in reality, oversighting something is the developer¿s fault, not the player's fault
[1:56:37] reefo: @pastterino you will end 4/6, but hopefully the fun is worth it
[1:56:45] TwoDancingLobsters: @StaysafeTV the issue like you said is the non 6/6 not making their own groups.
[1:56:47] Robglobgubob: Crimson Battle Mage would be interesting
[1:56:48] Mr_Moffert: get a guild
[1:56:48] dirbagdan: I love beating my head against the wall for hours to no avil Kappa
[1:56:53] Robglobgubob: turn int to ap
[1:56:58] g0dzilla: @gambleragain im not telling you how to play the game... im just telling you how i think about it... you can do whatever you wanna do... dont get me wrong
[1:57:03] OhMyMookie: everybody fucking bitched when lfg was added to wrath though. i know people who quit because of it
[1:57:23] zebulous: People do that in Retail
[1:57:28] gilgergesh: If it takes 2 hours to fill the raid though you didnt save time
[1:57:33] zebulous: Retail pugging SUCKS
[1:57:34] 编辑: ye
[1:57:38] timeoutandy: but wtf, people want the game to be so braindead and casual that u cant enjoy improving performance, mastering a class or trying to play the game optimalized. Cuz thats just gatekeeping the Gamer daddies, lazy gamer  problems DansGame
[1:57:48] Ropy123: @Jazzarus_ thats why I said "they just threw a bunch of shit", this is not "oversighting ", they have no idea what they are doing
[1:57:49] Mawshaw: @StaysafeTV How would you masterloot if you're already loot locked?
[1:57:49] Robglobgubob: group finder tool would be really nice so you could apply to groups
[1:57:54] Robglobgubob: I think that's a good point
[1:57:57] Munchagramz: "its a waste of my time i only need boss 2/8"
[1:57:57] OhMyMookie: @StaysafeTV they added LFG to wrath and people had a meltdown. now people have to use trade and addon
[1:58:00] hart_mk1: @zebulous it's awful, even worse when you're a new player without friends in the game already
[1:58:02] Jazzarus_: if you have boss loot, that doesnt matter, retail works like that and you just replace people, and it's literally a non factor
[1:58:11] Signa_arize: create a  tribute chest
[1:58:20] Jazzarus_: @Ropy123 then we agree, brother LUL
[1:58:25] Robglobgubob: tribute chest is a good idea
[1:58:31] brentosxd: Why are we listening to the guy that doesnt play wow anymore?
[1:58:35] kzenjo: buritos do sounce pretty nice.
[1:58:35] DankWizard420: holding all the loot til end is good for +1 aswell
[1:58:36] gambleragain: @g0dzilla Then stop being a brick wall, but rather understand what I'm saying. Staysafe said it too. If a 10th player is being bad, he's gonna hold back 9 other people. Simple as that. You're telling me im the problem.
[1:58:39] kzenjo: sound
[1:58:39] Robglobgubob: burrito sounds super nice. now I want mexican for dinner
[1:58:40] pretty_cool_guy: monkaHmm hmm burritos
[1:58:54] SpikedSahjahAngel: But, if the loot they want doesn't drop, they'll leave anyways.
[1:58:55] Ervill1: spamming trade chat is so social Kappa
[1:59:00] nearoz123: why not just let the entire raid have access to every item dropped individually
[1:59:07] Signa_arize: exactly
[1:59:14] reefo: @Ervill1 exactly this, there is no 'social aspect' to it
[1:59:17] eyonixz: ?
[1:59:20] Gurrehh: :tf:
[1:59:24] QuestFor420: QuestFor420 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 36 months!

[1:59:28] FrankYE1990: idk the loot system is fine in my opinion even if i dont need a item from the last bost u want to parse on it. am i th eonly one?
[1:59:28] Plokoon100: Its over....
[1:59:28] indocl0ud: No chest barbToxic
[1:59:30] Mr_Moffert: 5man loot hijackers EZ
[1:59:30] GodKingMuninn: then you're the majority #Democracy
[1:59:32] Plokoon100: Theres no answer
[1:59:33] Deamp: have just one 9m grp in the guild, and they run x times just to boost 1 guy each time for loot
[1:59:36] Signa_arize: 420 LETS GOOO
[1:59:37] DankWizard420: it's real simple, for those that leave after their boss they need to grow the fuck up KEKW
[1:59:44] gambleragain: @StaysafeTV Funny thing is. Ziqo made that video to complain. Then proceeded to present two simple solutions that make the problem non-existent. 1-He made a guild. 2- He made the raid himself.
[1:59:49] christiangodwarrior97: or blizzard can hire a wizard that electrocutes people that laeve after getting their loot

If you want to parse or speedrun, take it into a guild... but dont take this into the pug section... cause the pug section should be casual and fun without tryharding shit like warcraft logs etc...

[2:02:26] QuestFor420: 1000%
[2:02:31] gambleragain: @g0dzilla Thats your imagination. I'm gonna be friends with every pug group. Heck, i'm there just for loot. If I wanted a community i'll go find a guild. And again, people don't check logs to shame you. People check logs so they can invite the best players possible, to have the smoothest raid possible.
[2:02:32] wavecadet: unless there is only ONE item the person wants
[2:02:35] dontbecold: D: Loot at the end

[2:03:29] Atb50: For a full cut
[2:03:31] iSzy300: i would for full cut
[2:03:34] Treefungus: plz keep GDKP banned forever - i already pay to play the game a month i dont want to in game pay to play either
[2:03:46] ardice1: it blows my mind how much asmon talks about a game he hasnt played in a year
[2:03:49] zebulous: They made the fights hard?
[2:03:55] DankWizard420: asmon still yapping about death recovery KEKW
[2:03:57] reefo: @Treefungus doesn't impact you at all, you just want everyone to play the game how you play, facist
[2:04:00] QuestFor420: Asmon dont play many games so like whats he even got to say KEKW
[2:04:03] jameserush1: @staysafetv have you done the ashes of creation video yet?
[2:04:06] hart_mk1: i will say, as a newcomer to wow in SL, i've had a supremely better experience in classic than retail. i understand the complaints about LFR and DG finder
[2:04:13] g4rgs: Call me a boomer but fuk me gamer's are stooped these days
[2:04:17] timeoutandy: @ardice1 indeed, the fact that he said the polearm was good when not playing the game or having seen other items to compare it too was just lol.
[2:04:17] Treefungus: im honestly so glad its banned- stop selling /buying gold IRL
[2:04:18] QuestFor420: YEEE BABY
[2:04:19] VenomVeinZ: YEP
[2:04:19] daijahaden: Only three kind of people run GDKPs. Those who buy gold, those who play wow for a living, and those who already ran GDKPs enough to have a lot of gold.
[2:04:21] Treefungus: YEP
[2:04:21] HugzGG: no
[2:04:22] ardice1: or
[2:04:22] fartguyl: unphased
[2:04:23] DankWizard420: @QuestFor420 "many" aka none
[2:04:23] ardice1: you dont care
[2:04:28] iamgabe69: happy but shouldve been removed early
[2:04:34] soeger: Yes but i d also like to solve the bot issue
[2:04:35] QuestFor420: about
[2:04:36] grizz430: yes, but this chat is kinda biased
[2:04:36] QuestFor420: 5
[2:04:37] shadows_will22: sstvWAT
[2:04:37] Jazzarus_: I mean, it's cool that you dont want bad people in your group, but people in SoD take it too far, I mythic raid in retail and I got asked less stuff to join the guild.
[2:04:37] QuestFor420: 6
[2:04:39] Ropy123: you forgot a forth option, "I dont play Sod"
[2:04:41] pretty_cool_guy: 3 choosers GIGACHAD

[2:05:04] iSzy300: ive never done gdkp in sod but liked gdkp in classic
[2:05:05] depthcore__: rest in piss wont be missed
[2:05:07] OhMyMookie: GDKP was the single best raid format for pug raids.
[2:05:11] Pudgypantss: Wheres the I DONT PLAY WOW option
[2:05:11] OhMyMookie: i will die on this hill
[2:05:13] Mawshaw: 10% gold buyers 🫵 KEKW
[2:05:19] reefo: @OhMyMookie absolutely
[2:05:19] QuestFor420: 60sec
[2:05:19] ardice1: 90% of people havent even thought of it once since the beginning of the phase
[2:05:22] ardice1: you dont caree
[2:05:23] ardice1: LOL
[2:05:24] DankWizard420: I hoped to god gdkps were just banned instead of given the soft hand
[2:05:27] OhMyMookie: you can farm gold and use that in gdkps lmao
[2:05:28] g0dzilla: @gambleragain Yea and it should be like my imagination. Cause thats what a mmo should be... As i said, if you want to run raids for parsing or clear fast/speedrun, get a guild and run with them... But LFG should be for casuals and non competitve player without any experience needed... Cause those player dont have a place to be rn... and thats shitz...
[2:05:28] timeoutandy: ban all the ones who voted no
[2:05:35] Nytsongx: everyone that says no is a gold buyer with no skill that cant get loot on their own
[2:05:35] Ropy123: @Pudgypantss YES! Or 'I dont play SoD" :p
[2:05:36] QuestFor420: OH YOU BEEN TRAINING HUH

[2:06:15] FoleyGrail: 28 gold buyers in the chat
[2:06:17] OhMyMookie: @Nytsongx i said no and ive farmed over 700 gold in scarlet monastery
[2:06:18] reimur: @Mawshaw TRUHE

[2:06:22] reefo: @Mawshaw with or without gdkp, ppl are buying gold. dont be a fool
[2:06:24] CannonM2K: THAT says it All
[2:06:24] andyjamesgames: any heck givers in the chat ?
[2:06:25] Ropy123: gold buyers show yourself
[2:06:25] OhMyMookie: ive farmed close to 1000g and i want GDKPS
[2:06:27] Sunderwire_: LUL
[2:06:28] rotbonewow: SHIT PLAYERS WANT GDKPS COS THEY CANT GET INTO ANYTHING ELSE
[2:06:34] Ropy123: @timeoutandy LUL
[2:06:35] andyjamesgames: chat, do we still give a heck??
[2:06:42] gambleragain: @g0dzilla I give up. You're dense and delusional. You legit told me the game should be like in your imagination.
[2:06:45] Kholasis: don't have to buy gold to want GDKP..
[2:06:48] novvum: Most streamers and gold buyers are mad about GDKPs...only cause most streamers get free gold handed to them sadly
[2:06:51] BobbyJ135: @OhMyMookie work on ur mechanics then lol
[2:06:58] Rykor09: what?
[2:06:59] antilifeshell: GDKPs were free money
[2:07:01] hart_mk1: i don't agree with this take he's about to give
[2:07:03] DankWizard420: KEKW cooked asmon takes
[2:07:04] OhMyMookie: @BobbyJ135 i was a 99 parser phase one lmfao i lead a guild we are fine
[2:07:13] OhMyMookie: @BobbyJ135 work on your bankroll
[2:07:15] Rykor09: thats a terrible take by mr baldy
[2:07:16] caremeter: This shit is cringe, Asmongold has lost it imo.
[2:07:16] Mawshaw: RAID LOCKOUT NODDERS LOOT LOCKOUT NOPERS
[2:07:38] gambleragain: I don't care about pugs social aspect man. If I want to make friends i'll find a guild.
[2:07:45] pretty_cool_guy: FeelsStrongMan
[2:07:45] Ruinx81: All these things are how we got retail. People don’t get that all these changes they are sling for again in classic have all been asked before
[2:07:46] g0dzilla: @gambleragain Maybe i am yea... Doesnt mean im wrong...
[2:07:47] docfreeman1: they encourage you to form a social group relationship - the friction leads to groups/friends forming and its what most of the fun of wow comes from
[2:07:50] helmetnach0s: abolish raid lockouts
[2:07:50] warrenny: being shared to the group is bad
[2:07:50] zebulous: If you anonymously pugged retail, youd see how right you are
[2:07:50] Ervill1: remember the times when people would just play games for fun and not overthink and overcomplicate things?
[2:07:53] D3FT: FeelsStrongMan 420
[2:07:58] Aacro: Aacro subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 36 months! Asmon takes KEKW
[2:07:59] daijahaden: You have to have raid lockouts. The average wow player has no discipline and no ability defer gratification.   No raid lockout people would no life, get full BIS within a week and quit the game.
[2:08:00] Robglobgubob: with 3 day reset it really is not that big of a deal
[2:08:03] Jazzarus_: ok, cool, but then you have to deal with this job interview shit to join groups LUL
[2:08:11] caremeter: Coming from Top 5 Mythic/Wrath raiding to SoD has been a nice change of pace.  We blast shit and have fun.  These crybaby retards need to find guilds and socialize.  Fuck GDKPs and PUGs.
[2:08:13] primisus69: loot lock=world chat spam with WTS raid carry get all gear and gold sellers will be happy
[2:08:19] yaboyKobra: sure but then you run into the one guy who is not going to put his differences aside and then 9 people suffer instead of 1
[2:08:20] Ropy123: @gambleragain exactly, maybe people fail to understand that
[2:08:22] helmetnach0s: !whatif
[2:08:22] Nightbot: Pepega WHAT IF...
[2:08:25] Ruinx81: No group finder? I thought classic players hated group finder
[2:08:31] DankWizard420: @caremeter pugs are semi required sometimes, gdkps never are
[2:08:38] QuestFor420: Asmon's takes about games is ass cuz he dont play many games and seems to have great takes on them
[2:08:40] Mawshaw: @caremeter BASEDCIGAR ThatsGoingInMyBasedCompilation
[2:08:50] DankWizard420: 1 guy? takashi KEKW
[2:08:52] Robglobgubob: @Ruinx81 I think they hate RDF not necessarily group finder
[2:08:53] Mr_Moffert: execute them
[2:08:58] yaboyKobra: join a guild
[2:08:59] timeoutandy: check his linkedin :)
[2:09:02] zebulous: Just make sure they arent all gray parses
[2:09:04] SloMo904: screen before inv, logs required
[2:09:04] KKonaStevieG: nothing we must shoot that person :)
[2:09:05] surfhax: Just keep the way it is, or set Boss lockouts instead of Raid IDs.
[2:09:09] zol_zolli: bad rep system?
[2:09:17] Aacro: @QuestFor420 TRUEING
[2:09:19] zebulous: Guild is the answer
[2:09:22] caremeter: Warcraftlogs is the TOOL to use to vet everyone.  Its how we ALL get better too.  Sometimes im scuffed and not optimal, logs show me that.
[2:09:25] gambleragain: @g0dzilla So here's the deal. I pug and I want to parse. I want good runs with skill and dedicated players. And you want to deprive me from that.
[2:09:28] surfhax: So when your raid quits in the last boss, you can create a new raid group and invite everyone whos also at the last boss.
[2:09:29] Gurrehh: i check what race they play
[2:09:33] Jazzarus_: well, that will be fun when you have to do that for 40 people. They're going to take 20 hours to form a group LUL
[2:09:34] daijahaden: Demand peoples social security number/billing information/address before invite
[2:09:41] MachaObv: YEP
[2:09:41] hart_mk1: @caremeter as someone who doesn't have any friends that play wow but i enjoy classic immensely, it's daunting looking outside-in at the community
[2:09:56] yaboyKobra: Yeah in a pug you never know you could have the best player but toxic attitude you need to be in a guild pretty much
[2:10:02] VenomVeinZ: WOW TOKEN Random raid finder Pog
[2:10:07] Robglobgubob: I wish we had guild bank for raid consumes. would be nice instead of a bank toon
[2:10:15] sigilfish: YEP
[2:10:16] WhiskyThunder: so Boss IDs instead of Raid IDs
[2:10:17] docfreeman1: The game subtly pushing people toward guilds is a good kind of friction because guilds are what make WoW a true MMO and not just single player theme park with other random nerds
[2:10:18] gambleragain: I don't understand how this is topic of discussions. Look at yourself and decide what kind of player you are. Then find likeminded people.
[2:10:19] Signa_arize: i'm forced to pug because of my work schedule, it is what it is sstvDUMB
[2:10:19] DankWizard420: yeah blizzards spaghetti will manage that
[2:10:21] Jazzarus_: being in a guild is always superior and it's the solution to a lot of things
[2:10:21] sigilfish: keep it simple stupid
[2:10:22] Ruinx81: Similar to retail lol
[2:10:22] fartguyl: fuck the feds
[2:10:24] Garek96: no this makes alot of sence
[2:10:24] helmetnach0s: retardedly complicated
[2:10:25] DankWizard420: it's an asmon take so it's 100% cooked
[2:10:27] hart_mk1: yes, this particular take of his is bad
[2:10:28] QuestFor420: Sounds like someone dumb saying dumb things
[2:10:29] wavecadet: what if we could just pay real life money for loot and skip the raid lockout entirely
[2:10:30] zVaall: just clear the whole thing in 1 go and it doesnt matter?
[2:10:32] CannonM2K: To much in and out
[2:10:35] Ropy123: should they introduce tokens in SoD ? Kappa
[2:10:42] caremeter: @DankWizard420 THIS DUDE FUCKS
[2:10:46] WubstepTTV: howdy safe
[2:10:46] papamafs: this just sound stupid and will just make groups take longer to fell, cause you have to refil lafter each boss
[2:11:12] DankWizard420: @caremeter giving me ptsd from when he banned me like 3years ago YEP when he went on a crusade on "corpserunning isnt good and shouldnt exist" YEP
[2:11:27] dirbagdan: Remember when we used to just play the fucking game and didn't have to worry about this petty kind of shit?
[2:11:30] VenomVeinZ: no
[2:11:32] VenomVeinZ: lol
[2:11:36] Pudgypantss: wrong Kkona
[2:11:43] johnsmith_cb: gw2 lets you join any raid progress, you dont get the usual loot from bosses you killed that week
[2:11:44] VenomVeinZ: nothing
[2:11:45] gambleragain: he'll explain shortly
[2:11:49] qonflx84: wrong VenomVeinZ
[2:11:51] wavecadet: Loot lockout = you can kill the boss again
[2:11:52] SloMo904: 4/6 can join other 4/6 groups
[2:11:53] reeesheep123: the man is trying to make the game worse kekl
[2:11:55] iSzy300: and id has a code
[2:11:55] DrBobalu: lockout per instance vs per boss
[2:11:56] TwoDancingLobsters: you can join diff ID's on the same boss
[2:12:00] helmetnach0s: it’s a 3 day lockout who gives a fuck honestly
[2:12:01] warrenny: first your saved to that group of people
[2:12:06] surfhax: RAID ID you can't form another group with people that are also locked.
[2:12:07] dirbagdan: Asmon, go play FF
[2:12:11] Jazzarus_: retail is like the third option and it works like a charm
[2:12:11] g0dzilla: @gambleragain Do you need a pug to parse? Do you need a pug to get skill and dedicated player? No you dont. So you could get all of this in a guild...  Thats why im saying, we should take all this into guilds and leave the LFG System to casual player and make it less competitive... So everbody can choose between competitive playstyles and casual playstyles
[2:12:14] ccnn24: people cant help themselves, give them some control and they will put dumb short shighted rules in place w/o fail
[2:12:17] reefo: @helmetnach0s everyone who doesn't 6/6
[2:12:22] mickster111: Raid ID means someone in your group can take Raid ID and finish raid hindering you from killing anymore bosses
[2:12:26] DankWizard420: @johnsmith_cb but loot is a standard amount, if you cant look it heightens the loot per player
[2:12:26] Robglobgubob: yeah either need 1 or 2
[2:12:30] Robglobgubob: not both
[2:12:31] TwoDancingLobsters: you can only join diff ID's on the same boss I think for the middle one
[2:12:32] swaee: he middle one is you cant rekill bosses
[2:12:34] qonflx84: raid id is you are locked to that raid specifically cant join another raid at same boss or later, while raid lockouts is you are locked to specific bosses and can join other raids at any boss youve not killed
[2:12:38] MolrazZ: How would loot lockout work with non-personal loot though?
[2:12:38] docfreeman1: @StaysafeTV imagine how much gold we would make selling loot lockout carry runs over and over and over
[2:12:41] caremeter: I pray blizzard doesnt listen to this guy.  He's full of shit takes lately, maybe always idk.
[2:12:43] surfhax: Raid lockout is the best option, because it avoids people carrying others in loot lockouts
[2:12:44] HrdScp: @mickster111 did that ever exist in wow I can't remember
[2:12:46] randison33: agree that you should play well and know what you’re doing. couldn’t play for the first chunk of this phase and recently hit 40. how does one get in to get experience at this point? am I doomed this phase
[2:12:55] gambleragain: @g0dzilla Make your own group and invite the first people that post LFG.
[2:13:01] mickster111: @HrdScp thats what is in effect right now
[2:13:12] DankWizard420: just dont be shit and clear the entire raid it's an hour max KEKW
[2:13:16] mysalsaaa: What is the problem with SoD raiding? sorry missed the start
[2:13:18] ccnn24: carry runs w/o gold trading, ...um ok
[2:13:21] g0dzilla: @gambleragain again, its not about me... its about wow and the community...
[2:13:27] GodKingMuninn: Raid ID is the same format as mythic raid on rtail and those lockouts are dog shit
[2:13:32] englishurza: 10 man is the problem
[2:13:39] englishurza: larger raid size
[2:13:43] Aacro: "could be wrong" duckKek
[2:13:44] glenncloseisaman: Bro I like your channel but always showing videos of this scumbag is infuriating, this guy is the absolute lowest of the low
[2:13:45] englishurza: solves all of this
[2:13:48] DankWizard420: @GodKingMuninn a relic of an earlier time, mythic would be 10x better without the dogshit lockout
[2:13:51] VenomVeinZ: whats lost bark
[2:13:53] gambleragain: @g0dzilla Moron. It's the same thing. You and your whole wow community then. Make your own raids how you like t hem.
[2:13:55] Jazzarus_: @GodKingMuninn BASED
[2:13:57] swaee: if they did loot lockouts why wouldnt they do the same system as retail where theres a 20% chance for loot to drop per person that isnt loot locked to the boss already
[2:14:03] englishurza: 40 man can be far less picky
[2:14:05] wavecadet: yeah we wouldnt
[2:14:07] Jazzarus_: because you can replace people if they're dogshit @StaysafeTV
[2:14:09] timeoutandy: bcuz if someone leaves u could find a new grp of randoms
[2:14:11] wavecadet: no one wants to replace ppl mid run anyway
[2:14:13] SloMo904: if a group is 5/6 and tank dc's, you should be able to replace with some else 5/6
[2:14:14] Sabre_Wulf: because u can go in again with a dif group
[2:14:17] keanway: more attempts to clear
[2:14:17] scyllynn: it’s less risky to join a raid that doesn’t full clear
[2:14:21] GearzxGaming: Because you can always reform later one for last 3 bosses for example
[2:14:25] predoe: its less risky to bring joe blow to raid boss lock out cause you can kick em if they underperform
[2:14:25] clockworkillithid: Boss lockouts make way more sense if you want the raids to be Pugged
[2:14:29] zVaall: whats wrong with gatekeeping?  everything has a bare minimum
[2:14:29] clockworkillithid: It's not even close
[2:14:30] DankWizard420: @SloMo904 and why would a tank join a 5/6
[2:14:34] fartguyl: that would cause people to leave more frequent no?
[2:14:35] GodKingMuninn: ID means you cannot enter again, a lockout allows you still go in.
[2:14:41] SloMo904: @DankWizard420 they would also be 5/6
[2:14:43] r0xorzb0xorz: @g0dzilla @gambleragain FeelsGoodMan nymnCorn
[2:14:45] dirbagdan: @StaysafeTV There would probably be more because people would have the mentality of, "oh well they can just go find a nother group easier"
[2:14:46] afraidreality: It might be less risky but anyone whos gatekeeping doesnt want to be wasting their time rerunning the dungeon with a differnt group anyways
[2:14:46] qonflx84: nothing
[2:14:52] DankWizard420: @SloMo904 actual cookery KEKW
[2:14:57] hart_mk1: BASED
[2:14:58] g0dzilla: @gambleragain its not possible... cause it requires to have 6/6 exp and cosnumes and 99 parses ect... cant you see the issue if you open LFG Bulletin Board? You cant be that blind dude
[2:14:58] dirbagdan: YEP
[2:14:59] Munchagramz: gatekeeping needs to be balenced
[2:15:08] GodKingMuninn: RAID ID is you're stuck with those 9 fucks. Raid Lockout means you can go get stuck with a different 9 fucks
[2:15:18] SloMo904: @DankWizard420 how is that bad? boss lockouts>raid ids
[2:15:19] hart_mk1: i'm new and i totally understand that i will be gatekept until i learn things, that's fine and i accept that
[2:15:20] mickster111: people get too tunnel vision on warcraft logs
[2:15:23] gambleragain: @g0dzilla MAKE...THE...RAID...WITHOUT...REQUIREMENTS!
[2:15:32] Munchagramz: comunitys can be ruined and also starved of new players from gatekeeing to much/ to little
[2:15:35] HrdScp: then boosting would exist
[2:15:42] timeoutandy: It isnt bad. The people complaining about not getting invited, not having logs, doing minimum effort could create their own 5/6 pug or join a guild. They complain just to complain
[2:15:47] afraidreality: I think gatekeeping is perfectly acceptable. Accept with blizzards balancing gatekeeping can often be out of the hands of individual players which doesnt feel good
[2:15:51] hawkin_fring: hawkin_fring subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 8 months, currently on a 8 month streak! hey bro hope you re doing good gl hf
[2:15:51] QuestFor420: He dont play idk why hes talking about the game
[2:15:52] DankWizard420: @Munchagramz see mythic raiding in retail KEKW
[2:15:53] nemo___x: not making 10man raid would fix this too :)
[2:16:02] gambleragain: Just want to get carried.
[2:16:09] johnsmith_cb: and bad players want to get carried YEP
[2:16:14] KKonaStevieG: not me i like playing with shit players because the challenge Kappa
[2:16:18] ccnn24: its sod, good player can carry anything really
[2:16:25] Jazzarus_: you're right, but then you run into the problem of not getting new players and the game stagnates and then good players complain their game is dead
[2:16:37] gambleragain: Dude, I'm not gonna play with people who can't jump in the water at Baron Aquantis man.
[2:16:39] DankWizard420: good players join a guild KEKW
[2:16:41] reefo: @ccnn24 we just watched a video where the good player (ziqo) was not able to carry everyone :)
[2:16:42] DankWizard420: that is it
[2:16:45] qonflx84: you don't want to let in people to your area, you keep the gate, understandable to gatekeep to keep out invaders, which noobs are, they're trying to invade people's groups, they're not wanted, people want good players, not bad ones
[2:16:48] QuestFor420: yeah i agree
[2:16:51] robthehammer760: robthehammer760 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 36 months, currently on a 36 month streak! 3 years of based. love ya dude
[2:16:52] iSzy300: truth.
[2:16:56] hart_mk1: trying to plug a leaky dam
[2:17:25] g0dzilla: @gambleragain what if im new to the game and i never cleared a dungeon? then i get flamed that i dont lead and dont know mechanics... cool... yea, making my own is the best solution... pls bro... start looking at the whole picture...
[2:17:55] Jazzarus_: lost ark is one of the worst games I've ever seen
[2:17:58] wavecadet: not even close
[2:18:02] hart_mk1: @g0dzilla i am that new player, here's my response to you: be fucking competent and do your research outside the game
[2:18:04] kompany111: im just bored as fuck. bis gear.
[2:18:05] wavecadet: PVP balance way bigger issue
[2:18:06] johnsmith_cb: g0dzilla make a group for noobs like you or learn from videos
[2:18:07] Mawshaw: Asmon having these takes but also hasn't touched SOD since the middle of phase 1 KEKL

[2:18:20] MaybeRespect: @kompany111 happens when you nolife any game :P
[2:18:21] irate____: the problem is everybody wants the meta instead of bringing anyone
[2:18:23] SloMo904: its a problem, good players do not want to get stuck in a 4/6 wasted lockout
[2:18:24] keanway: phased releases is cringe
[2:18:29] StaysafeTV: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5o9nIiOFTI
[2:18:32] gambleragain: @g0dzilla Then you watch some videos put some effort. Find a guild. Start as social and eventually raid.
[2:18:33] DankWizard420: ziko also does negative damage YEP
[2:18:36] qonflx84: yeah i mean noobs are their own problem, just watch a boss video, then you don't mess up and get kicked 4Head
[2:18:41] clockworkillithid: Balance, gold buying/false bans over it, Phases double as long as they should be, 10 man instead of 20 man raids all bigger deals
[2:18:42] dormdotz: SoD problem is literally everything other than raiding.
[2:18:43] zyrr: @SloMo904 whats the problem here?
[2:18:47] qonflx84: just learn to play 4Head

[2:19:24] Pudgypantss: best way is to pay a mage to boost you even faster in sm
[2:19:24] TheWhiteRabbitxX: if they didn’t have phase releasing sod would have been dead already. totally. and most people would have quit because they felt so far behind. like every other time this happens
[2:19:25] Robglobgubob: going to be so nice
[2:19:26] Moo360: honestly the xp change fixes the biggest sod p2 problem
[2:19:31] helmetnach0s: I’m reading the Arthas book so I already know who Calia is
[2:19:33] Robglobgubob: getting all classes to 40 here
[2:19:50] DankWizard420: @SloMo904 still join a guild, it's the social fabric of literally all mmos, actually a minority problem
[2:19:52] Jazzarus_: joining a guild solves a lot of problems, but some people dont do it cause they cant stick to a raid schedule and they just pug when they're available
[2:19:53] staymoonkinJR: i came for the AoC content 4Weird

[2:23:13] hart_mk1: @gambleragain developing relationships with other players isn't a problem with being competent at the game anymore. the people i want to befriend aren't the type that necessarily want to make new friends in a video game. that's my take anyway

[2:24:25] BigChoobs: AOC is a bolshevik
[2:24:26] qonflx84: @lanayiadk 2 or 3 if you count the review of the game
[2:24:26] osopolar1977: azmond fell off

[2:24:37] realgypso: then asmon's chat calls it a ps2 game so annoying
[2:24:39] pepesmokez: so true
[2:24:43] johnsmith_cb: look at wow, shit graphics and lags too
[2:24:46] capybaras17: let’s all go play mine craft

[2:24:58] overlandingaggie: circa 2004
[2:25:00] Moo360: private servers managed it lol
[2:25:06] fSaneee: streamer reacting to a streamer reacting to a youtuber reacting to a gameplay video, what a time to be alive
[2:25:07] jerbears: wrong unfortunately, network performance based on clients depends on engine, not graphics
[2:25:12] r0xorzb0xorz: if its engineered well it can be done. downscaling models, textures, particles etc dynamically depending on how many are being rendered
[2:25:13] Jazzarus_: that's why wow art style holds so well
[2:25:13] staymoonkinJR: @StaysafeTV they said they know its possible
[2:25:15] lanayiadk: Jesus ... Staysafe reacting to Asmongold reacting to Narc reacting to the dev update
[2:25:28] Robglobgubob: imagine trying to do ashenvale or stv if wow had those graphics.
[2:25:29] Measai: no mmo used nanite rendering yet
[2:25:32] EddyyBear: Graphics are client-side. MMO is server-side. You can have high perf in either without impacting the respective other.
[2:25:44] Mawshaw: Valheim music Listening
[2:25:45] DankWizard420: @EddyyBear KEKL WHAT
[2:25:49] grylz89: Combat movement looks terrible.....the combat has to be SUPERB for this game to succeed
[2:25:52] hart_mk1: @Mawshaw same i love it
[2:26:00] gambleragain: @hart_mk1 I understand that the game is not the social paradise it used to be. But the game is what it is. The playerbase is older now. If you don't already have friends who play the game you're gonna struggle.
[2:26:02] nightballa: is this Epoch?
[2:26:14] candll: harry potter mmo?
[2:26:18] fatjuicywaffle1: rather play wow

[2:26:57] Metaphix: 35 year old men looking to relive the good old days LULW
[2:27:01] Lionkingler1: gonna have like 50k players tops
[2:27:04] qonflx84: wait the age restriction on this game is 35+?
[2:27:07] Aacro: New World did, AGS just fucked up on retaining players
[2:27:08] grylz89: Mmos live and die by their combat system. It HAS to be better than wow, which is damn near impossible.
[2:27:19] crovenkb: my character will be balding as wellk
[2:27:20] qonflx84: wait the age restriction on this game is 35+? i'm too young to play?! 😭
[2:27:22] osopolar1977: exactly
[2:27:29] clockworkillithid: Tab target is a better combat system IMO
[2:27:30] caremeter: @qonflx84 Yes, and you have to send in a photo of your malding ass to get into the beta.
[2:27:31] obstata: is that magneto
[2:27:35] johnsmith_cb: grylz89 brother, wow combat system is one of the lowest bars to clear
[2:27:37] qonflx84: @caremeter LuL
[2:27:48] its_Blocky: @obstata that's what I thought too LUL
[2:27:49] gambleragain: @g0dzilla Just want to check smth. And if you're not playing I would say that's more likely. Cause you're spewing so much shit, it really looks like you're not playing the game but rather going off what Asmon and Ziqo said in the video.
[2:27:54] reefo: @grylz89 exactly this, games all show off huge beautiful worlds in the previews to get ppl excited, then the fighting (the main part of the game) fails
[2:27:55] Mawshaw: All I see is shit that will make me lag YEP
[2:27:56] hart_mk1: @gambleragain right, i was trying to ask what your solution or advice would be. this is also a problem in that new players are ostracized in turn, which is bad for many reasons, too many to post here lol
[2:27:59] Metaphix: @grylz89 i agree wow's combat is just poppy enough, just relaxed enough, and easy to learn hard to master. Difficult to beat
[2:28:24] kompany111: I played the "beta" they had in 2019 on steam it was soooo different from this.
[2:28:28] g0dzilla: @gambleragain you want to check what? my warcraft logs?
[2:28:28] DankWizard420: ?? console commands bad
[2:28:31] r0xorzb0xorz: dumbass take

[2:28:36] sigilfish: bit weird take
[2:28:36] pretty_cool_guy: OMEGALUL
[2:28:42] Reiumi_: HUH
[2:28:43] clockworkillithid: WoW does Tab target combat better then any other MMO, one of the major reasons it was so successful. Play SWTOR and see what it feels like when it isnt polished as well
[2:28:47] Moo360: very weird take
[2:28:48] DankWizard420: it's literally to skip the steps to spawn it
[2:28:48] englishurza: lol who is this guy...what a nerd.
[2:28:57] Deamp: that cloak physics...
[2:29:06] DankWizard420: looks like magneto
[2:29:09] qonflx84: yes :)
[2:29:11] Moo360: holy shit this guy is an idiot
[2:29:13] reefo: yes they will exactly do that, what an idiot
[2:29:14] pretty_cool_guy: asmon struggling to not call the guy a dumbass
[2:29:16] Short_TFT: what a dumb fucking take

[2:29:18] Highkriger: Pepega
[2:29:19] Metaphix: is he magneto
[2:29:19] lilkreamys: during alpha 2 yes probably
[2:29:20] sigilfish: @clockworkillithid movement is also big factor, its not as fluid in swtor
[2:29:22] R3ga1: YUP WHAT A GOOD TAKE
[2:29:22] aligned1: is this guy retarded
[2:29:23] abruptdecayO_O: lmfaoaoaoaooaoa
[2:29:25] Juubbz: That cape BS is already pissing me off @StaysafeTV
[2:29:30] DankWizard420: I will be in the negative brain quartile if I hear this guy speak again
[2:29:31] reefo: you can just trigger on a timer if u want to do that lol
[2:29:32] lilkreamys: during launch i dont see it
[2:29:33] Genghish: Looks scuffed
[2:29:35] gambleragain: @hart_mk1 There's no secret recipe. Play the game. Take it slow. Why rush to the end game as a new player? Doesn't make sense. You'll just be a burden to the good players.
[2:29:43] sigilfish: its alpha PogO
[2:29:43] lilkreamys: during beta idc
[2:29:45] EddyyBear: @englishurza It's Narciverse. Check out his stream, it's awesome.
[2:29:48] TheWhiteRabbitxX: you would need way too many people to trigger it in an aloha
[2:29:51] iMattbat: ALPHA, key word
[2:29:54] AmarokUnchained: GAME already dead.. POOGERS
[2:29:55] clockworkillithid: @sigilfish Very true. Client side movement leaves the game open to exploits (See flyhackers) but makes it feel way better to play
[2:29:57] gambleragain: @g0dzilla Do you play the game or no?
[2:29:58] yoso22bc: sstvEmcel sstvEmcel
[2:30:01] fuzzysucculent: drama darmer

[2:32:00] DankWizard420: this guy pepeL
[2:32:03] r0xorzb0xorz: this guy seems like a cunt
[2:32:04] gambleragain: @g0dzilla So you don't play the game. You're legit a brainwashed moron who can't form an opinion by his own research. Ofc you're the type of a player who won't invest 3 min to watch a gnomergan guide.
[2:32:08] IIINUCLEAR: what is this guy talking about
[2:32:13] R3ga1: the guy talking is 120 wet

[2:32:35] Moo360: lol this youtuber
[2:32:44] robthehammer760: big true
[2:32:49] reefo: @AxelFromAustralia i dont disagree, but i thin it will look betteer on my 4090 than on a stream is all. I probably won't even buy this game
[2:33:04] AxelFromAustralia: @reefo is it releasing soon?
[2:33:10] reefo: i have no idea lol
[2:33:29] KKonaStevieG: YEP can't read
[2:33:36] hart_mk1: @gambleragain of course, that was my initial answer - be competent and become a good player first, but that doesn't solve the problem that most other players already competent most likely won't be interested in adding you because they already have a list full of friends who are competent as well. i may be wrong about that, however
[2:33:43] father_ruckus_: its an mmo,  what story
[2:33:44] AmarokUnchained: then nothing is important YEP
[2:33:50] johnsmith_cb: personally i do
[2:33:51] g0dzilla: @gambleragain i said "it doesnt matter if i play the game or i dont" how can you tell that im not playing? what if i play? just because i say "it doesnt matter" doesnt mean im not playing does it?
[2:33:58] clockworkillithid: Over or under on 2026 Release date guys?
[2:34:00] Measai: but blizz would disable loot from dropping if any environment effect helped you
[2:34:06] Genghish: Voice acting is bad for performance no?
[2:34:09] robthehammer760: these guys still arguing amongst themselves ten minutes later lol
[2:34:17] reefo: @hart_mk1 no ppl will want to play with you regardless of your skill level, just you have to match their skill also
[2:34:30] dontbecold: POG
[2:34:36] Genghish: Real
[2:34:38] r0xorzb0xorz: BASED
[2:34:39] gambleragain: @g0dzilla Then give me a name of a character you play or tell me yes or no if you play the game. So I can take you seriously.
[2:34:41] father_ruckus_: that AI Voip addon for wow is amazing lol
[2:34:41] abruptdecayO_O: the voiceover addon is bare minimum and is pretty solid
[2:34:42] boxhead66: use the wow addon as an example
[2:34:55] hart_mk1: @reefo that's my point, i don't want to play with bad players but as a new player that's most likely all the ppl i'm going to have a chance to play with
[2:34:56] iMattbat: It's like you don't even care about the artists Kappa
[2:35:23] reefo: @hart_mk1 yea but if u are competent, you read warcraftlogs, and you actively improve your parses, you will outgrow them quickly
[2:35:44] gambleragain: @hart_mk1 That's a lie. Most competent players will find a group. Unless they're lazy. This happens when players think they're good enough but their ego is hurt by the process of having to prove it.
[2:35:46] EddyyBear: It's been 7 years in the making. One would hope that SOMETHING has come of it. I mean...
[2:35:46] johnsmith_cb: who gives a fuck
[2:35:47] reefo: the only thing that people gauge you by at a high lvl is your parse
[2:36:01] Metaphix: this is a pretty minor gripe to bring up
[2:36:03] g0dzilla: @gambleragain Well, as i said, both doesnt matter... Take me serious or dont... Those 2 infos ur asking about shouldnt change ur "so i can take you seriously" thing...
[2:36:07] WhineGodTV: the guy who made this video is super annoying nobody cares about his opinion, just give us the facts smh
[2:36:20] fuzzysucculent: i really hope they dont give in to pressure and dont rush it, id rather this come out in 2030 perfect then 2026 semi scuffed
[2:36:20] clockworkillithid: AOC isn't going to have Addons tho right? So it will have to be considerably easier without the tools they provide, Dont think parse culture will be a thing in a game like that
[2:36:37] Munchagramz: those small things are what gamers will fall in love with
[2:36:37] UtmostTurnip: It's true. Wow has those
[2:36:40] freehawk1: I disagree!
[2:36:53] gambleragain: @g0dzilla Well it does matter. Cause you're giving off wrong information sir. In order to understand your perspective, I need to understand where you're coming from.
[2:36:56] lilkreamys: how long have they been working on aoc
[2:37:09] clockworkillithid: No DPS meters, raids are going to have to be real easy to clear them
[2:37:12] brady_crazy0: Game wikis killed mmos

[2:37:32] r0xorzb0xorz: pepeP
[2:37:41] warrenny: players can be wrong
[2:37:42] freehawk1: I disagree with Asmon. The hype for AoC is off the charts, if they release it now people will realize how amateurish it is.
[2:37:43] g0dzilla: @gambleragain where do i give off wrong infos? pls tell me so i can change that... i dont want to give away wrong infos
[2:37:45] brady_crazy0: If mmmos want to be popular again, governments need need to unite and ban game wikis
[2:37:47] father_ruckus_: i pretty much only have faith in Japaneses devs now-a-days
[2:37:49] docfreeman1: it also means the game is solved when it comes out already
[2:37:52] qonflx84: devs can be wrong too warrenny and they usually are

[2:38:33] spy_bones: lost ark
[2:38:35] vp_z: sandbox mmo's are all dead on arrival
[2:38:35] hart_mk1: @gambleragain i'm not trying to be confrontational with this, just discussing my personal experience so far and my impressions. i ahven't reached the point where i can raid in classic yet but even running dungeons can be annoying... most of the time ppl don't care until you wipe, meaning i'm expected to do a ton of study outside the game before i play the game
[2:38:40] lilkreamys: something that keeps you holding on
[2:38:48] KKonaStevieG: i think it takes that long till people realize they hate eachother YEP
[2:38:50] overlandingaggie: back to wow you go

[2:38:54] pretty_cool_guy: when are they gonna make wow 2
[2:38:55] Fizby: is it because the genre is cursed or is it because the games are shit? @StaysafeTV
[2:38:57] TheKidCody16: what game is this?
[2:38:57] Butterywheel: its like that games arnt being made by ppl who play games
[2:39:00] warrenny: impossible expectations?
[2:39:03] englishurza: Good raids or its DOA
[2:39:05] Butterywheel: dont*
[2:39:06] CrusaderNero: lol AoC might be out by 2030
[2:39:12] hart_mk1: @gambleragain to clarify i'm fine with researching raids but not every single dungeon
[2:39:14] father_ruckus_: they shouldnt listen to players,   players are largely retarded
[2:39:21] PieceOfPanic: "best selling" "critically acclaimed" "recordbreaking" "10/10" . . . . "bugged" "hacks" "bots" "exploits" "security"
[2:39:41] KKonaStevieG: YEP and it's bloated and souless
[2:39:51] reefo: @hart_mk1 for the most part you dont need to research dungeons in classic are pretty braindead easy, if groups are struggling with dungeons, they won't even come close in raids.
[2:39:57] Metaphix: LFR is full of em
[2:39:59] vp_z: its weird because m+ right now is easier then ever, same with normal/heroic raids

[2:40:10] gambleragain: @g0dzilla I need to understand if you come from a place of delusions. Complaining for the sake of complaining. Or actually experienced something that I strongly believe is not an issue if people become competent.
[2:40:10] Eras25: asmongold ??? lol

[2:40:41] warrenny: challenging is fun
[2:41:02] gambleragain: @hart_mk1 You'll also have to understand that the game is almost 20 years old. With tons of guides out there. People expect you to have some basic knowledge.

Just try to be open minded and take a view from all sides of player. Not only urs... Im not saying YOU are doing anything bad, im saying it shouldnt be like that. Keep that in mind.

[8:56:13] funweekenddad: THe tank strat is to tank in the middle and kite back so you guys can get button easier
[8:56:21] robbiestacks: that must be a paperwork nightmare for the parents
[8:56:39] CALOT_ROGUE: Not going to lie if you and Payo got into a real life fight all my fucking chips are going on you with the fight lasting 10 seconds….
[8:56:40] sirdreadeye: he's a 10/10 gamer

[8:58:30] Shreddingly: It looks like tokashi isn't the metamorphis lock to me
[8:58:35] Mawshaw: FFS

[8:59:07] Dmaceee: Crackerzac suckz
[8:59:13] DanRas08: Why did that make that much dmg? Normally it's just like 35% hp right
[8:59:13] LocoPollo1: OH YEAH
[8:59:14] HotFlatDietPepsi: that ain't good chief
[8:59:15] JamesRig: oh wow that HPS is low
[8:59:16] LocoPollo1: thats way too low
[8:59:18] BlownFuse_: oh thats bad
[8:59:19] SloMo904: thats really low hps
[8:59:22] funweekenddad: You guys need to assign ranged between each pillar and have the lock roaming to click buttons that spawn twice.
[8:59:25] LocoPollo1: I usually do 200+
[8:59:25] icyhawtt: Tokashi a hard carry
[8:59:26] JamesRig: I do 250 hps on my priest ez
[8:59:28] inspiredtv: priests should have 300-400 hps
[8:59:38] fartguyl: heals are the greatest
[8:59:38] Tokashi96: So now yall know why I  was on bombs?
[8:59:41] fartguyl: arent
[8:59:41] Tokashi96: look at this locks dmg
[8:59:43] speedzombie: @inspiredtv naaaa
[8:59:43] Tokashi96: doing the bombs
[8:59:44] Lunights: if you have a meta on bomb duty they literally shouldnt exist
[8:59:48] Tokashi96: less than me when I  did bombs
[8:59:49] Mastopo: time to raid lead and tell everyone to get a pillar
[8:59:52] CALOT_ROGUE: It kind of makes me happy knowing a big game steamer like yourself has these types of struggles….I’ve pugged and cleared Gnomer every time……
[9:00:04] LocoPollo1: @inspiredtv not on that fight to have 300+ is if the priest is SOLO healing 200+ is good 150 or less is trash
[9:00:05] fartguyl: @tokashi96 bomb duty. no dps on boss pretty much
[9:00:09] NotTheWheel: You must
[9:00:10] Naddah: a meta can one shot each bomb and just have someone else push the buttons
[9:00:12] bone555: KEKW KEKW KEKW
[9:00:15] SuaSponte: high hps means dps is bad and/or raid sucks at mechjanics
[9:00:16] SneakyChalupa: StayOLD
[9:00:18] d00dGC: @staysafetv ya'll good in there?
[9:00:18] Sowiloo: @fartguyl bomb duty, didn't kill bombs KEKL

[9:00:21] ryufromstreets6: he needs to do his taxes
[9:00:21] handlights: you chose the demon raid lifestyle
[9:00:25] funweekenddad: Take control and raid lead this fight
[9:00:28] chintack: @CALOT_ROGUE this is purely for content
[9:00:28] revora_: @calot_rogue he generally clears the raid fast. This alt and this raid is special
[9:00:29] funweekenddad: ezpz
[9:00:29] t0rstin: Grandpa
[9:00:35] fartguyl: @Sowiloo or press button.. lol
[9:00:36] Naddah: meta does bombs only and it wins easy
[9:00:36] CALOT_ROGUE: Is this all Swamp members?
[9:00:44] inspiredtv: @speedzombie the disc I play with every week in every raid gets 300+ hps consistantly and i get around 200 hps as resto
[9:00:44] Gabe4D: @StaysafeTV My guild parsed gray and low greens last night dps wise, we cleared it. needed FAP's and good mechanics, took 10 min to kill
[9:00:50] Gabe4D: @staysafetv I healed
[9:01:01] Gabe4D: https://sod.warcraftlogs.com/reports/4vVAG36wNZhJ7qby#fight=last&type=damage-done
[9:01:01] HotFlatDietPepsi: @inspiredtv resto shammy or druid?

[9:01:13] Xgeonmar: BUY MY DPS THO
[9:01:24] SneakyChalupa: Is it not largely the healer's fault rn? The tank keeps dying
[9:01:31] Batistann: The struggle is real
[9:01:32] HotFlatDietPepsi: @inspiredtv is it still just wild growth + wrath spam?
[9:01:35] handlights: @tokashi96 show us how to game
[9:01:37] DankWizard420: @SneakyChalupa the tank is taking 4x the stacks he shuold
[9:01:37] Gabe4D: @StaysafeTV I hit bombs while healing lol
[9:01:38] Gerald_zdg: but my dps tho
[9:01:46] inspiredtv: @LocoPollo1 I asked them for it last week when we ran and then they never posted, I have to live log it this reset tomorrow
[9:01:55] ardice1: @tokashi96 cant even do the bombs he proved that last time LOL
[9:01:57] Shreddingly: Will you do wild growth if he does bombs though? Sounds like a fair trade
[9:02:00] Xgeonmar: boomer clock is ticking
[9:02:00] inspiredtv: @HotFlatDietPepsi yeah pretty much, I play imp rejuv spec because nourish buffs
[9:02:02] Gerald_zdg: did you get a new camera @StaysafeTV

[9:02:16] ChidyCo: @tokashi96 stfu
[9:02:17] revora_: @tokashi96 do the bombs cunt
[9:02:17] SloMo904: healers doing 100 hps is really bad
[9:02:18] iMattbat: this raid needs more 420 LETS GOOOOO
[9:02:18] ardice1: you a broken record?
[9:02:19] d00dGC: RIP tokashi parse
[9:02:27] quinoasalad112: classic PUG andys not be shit at the game challenge : impossible
[9:02:28] Gabe4D: @StaysafeTV Everyone get FAP's and swiftness potion, all ranged get bombs if nearby, ez win
[9:02:34] speedzombie: @inspiredtv i just did the boss. 130 hps priest 250 hps druid. cleared it fine. grannted the fight was 4 minutes so that helps
[9:02:35] jasonbriggs: @tokashi96 step up gtfo
[9:02:37] DankWizard420: @SneakyChalupa if they could do literally any mechanic right theyd get past p1 KEKW
[9:02:39] HotFlatDietPepsi: this raid is way more tame than i thought it'd be
[9:02:40] CALOT_ROGUE: Dude I’m sorry to say but I think this is not happening….
[9:02:45] OneAndOnlyAron: show healing instead of threat
[9:02:46] KingIngeborg: 1 grp boss and 1grp bombs, easy loot
[9:02:46] CALOT_ROGUE: I could be wrong…
[9:02:56] radassbadass69: peepoRun u on your way to the button hopefully peepoRun
[9:02:59] bone555: KEKW KEKW KEKW  󠀀
[9:02:59] quackums: LUL
[9:03:05] HotFlatDietPepsi: dragging the boss to the entrance for all 4 phases definitely makes it easier, but takes longer
[9:03:08] Randomguy_360: YEP click the butt tin
[9:03:09] CALOT_ROGUE: Your group sounds tooooo baked bro lol
[9:03:16] Gabe4D: @StaysafeTV Have your hunter be dedicated bomb killer, and other ranged on button duty
[9:03:21] inspiredtv: @speedzombie I think it definitely depends on where the tanks are tanking it and if I get assigned to a pillar or not, theres alot of times where Im having to run across the map to get one hot on someone
[9:03:21] SneakyChalupa: @HotFlatDietPepsi your name gives me PTSD
[9:03:23] SloMo904: @speedzombie your one druid outhealed both of those healers
[9:03:26] Gabe4D: everytime bombs drop, make your hunter kill the bombs that have spawned
