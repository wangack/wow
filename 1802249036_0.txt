[1:46:03] ArcaneSyntax: The spectral tiger in china

[1:46:11] konkytonkyy: lots of ppl 60
[1:46:21] fourseti1234: @jhonothesecond people are farming raids
[1:46:38] ArcaneSyntax: @electafuzz I was talking about the tiger
[1:46:44] reaSxDD: so once you hit lvl 60 you're immune to dying right and just continue to play classic as is?
[1:47:11] OssewTV: @reeeeeaS up to you. or u can raid and do dungeons as HC and if u die u delete.
[1:47:20] ArcaneSyntax: You can continue hc doing dungeons and raids
[1:47:21] fourseti1234: no if you die at 60 your still dead in the eyes of the HC
[1:47:38] reaSxDD: but it said something on the website about when you hit lvl 60 you reach imortality? @AntiVirus93
[1:47:57] fourseti1234: a lot of people ding 60 and consider the HC challange over though. but many guilds still carry through with it
[1:48:07] OssewTV: @reeeeeaS yes u can choose immortality and play classic as is but gl doing that on the HC servers. u would prolly have to xfer off to play classic as is.
[1:48:29] 6all: no
[1:48:34] Jarless: no
[1:48:35] fourseti1234: i was told no. but maybe you can
[1:48:36] ArcaneSyntax: The increased kill speed makes up for the less xp
[1:48:37] gooni_coyg: u cant trade
[1:48:39] adxx: i think only if you are 60
[1:48:41] WoW_StandalonE: no u cant until 60
[1:48:41] agggro: No
[1:48:41] therealbrigade: No trading in group
[1:48:42] Aristicals: you cant trade until 60
[1:48:43] Teelly: no, you can never trade
[1:48:43] foghagymatyi: no trading until lvl 60
[1:48:44] reaSxDD: so people raid and try to have people not dying?
[1:48:44] Lugia_Blizz: No trade

[1:48:48] dreamwalker213: No trading

[1:49:24] reaSxDD: does the addon prevent you from doing certain aspects of the game or you just need to readup on the rules?

[2:55:14] EKS90_: from what i heard, its not the end of the world if 1 person turns out to not be hardcore. but ideally you want everyone to be hardcore to make it fair.
[2:55:14] Daarksyde: the best part of HC is seeing people die and their last words

[2:56:55] fourseti1234: hey towelliee. can i link you in game a cool item im proud of i just got?
[2:57:03] Foretoldlegends: If you don't use int, I'd say the ring wouldn't be worth it for a rogue or a warrior in fairness.
[2:57:04] Lupine_Fury: rings at that level are like hunters with weapons
[2:57:08] indiegarona: @DallDK Sorry I have been living under a rock, but I am making my way back to Azeroth!
[2:57:10] adxx: lol that rogues name that just died
[2:57:14] dizzlethebot: @indiegarona Itâ€™s like a rough lite for meâ€¦..I learn like 5 levels at a time lol
[2:57:19] RyzuxTV: I started the HC run and quit at 14 when I realized I never had a 60 before and thinking about deleting the character made me go nuts
[2:57:50] DallTV_: @Indiegarona a rock damn thats sounds like alot of presure and pain :)
[2:58:03] dizzlethebot: @ryzuxgaming You donâ€™t have to delete, can just keep leveling or transfer

[2:59:36] indiegarona: @Indiegarona I love your name, cow! You're right about that, I just have always had a hard time deleting characters lol.
[2:59:38] PapaPing1: Worst way to go in HC is by fall damage

[3:00:45] indiegarona: @DallDK very good changes - it's just been a long, painful grind.
[3:00:45] Malarick: so if one person dies in the dungeon, does the whole group fail and have to delete?
[3:00:47] Lostdogal: yup, I got ptsd just watching
[3:00:57] ArcaneSyntax: Does the wheel trick still work
[3:01:05] fourseti1234: theres the wheel trick though
[3:01:09] Foretoldlegends: @Malarick Just the person who dies.
[3:01:11] PapaPing1: ww that sucks too
[3:01:11] Nerendis: There's a really cool leash spot where you can kite them back and forth. But really needs a hunter
[3:01:11] fourseti1234: @ArcaneSyntax i think so
[3:01:16] soundpraenk: @torbturret_km94 that's impressive considering your char was lock
[3:01:20] fourseti1234: but i dont KNOW for a fact lol

[3:22:51] pereadin: Might as well do it early
[3:23:02] Aquadriel: if you get to 40 Kappa\
[3:23:04] ArcaneSyntax: SoC is kind of like a better windfury
[3:23:07] indiegarona: @Indiegarona I suppose I would try hardcore if I wasn't solo. :)
[3:23:27] ArcaneSyntax: Yeah
[3:23:28] Mecabeast: Don't you need gold for 60 mount unless you do diremaul?
[3:23:29] fourseti1234: it helps
[3:23:31] WoW_StandalonE: Deflection is a very good talent
[3:23:34] NestLucky: crusader with commander
[3:23:34] fourseti1234: but only for like longer fights
[3:23:44] ArcaneSyntax: You hoj then judge command
[3:23:45] EKS90_: yes but its also not really worth outside of tougher mobs for mana
[3:23:47] weirdsp4ce: Does the pally mount quest take you anywhere shady?
[3:23:52] Athaeln: Even if you donâ€™t die itâ€™s doubtful that you will reach 40 before 10.1
[3:23:52] fourseti1234: exactly
[3:23:54] dreamwalker213: @mecabeast 60 is a long time away lol
[3:23:59] bangerratte: are tanks even harder to find in hardcore?
[3:24:02] EKS90_: @Indiegarona my warr is 23, its fucking heartracing solo haha. so I get that.
[3:24:03] tornbraclet: if you judge someone that is stunned it his in the 100's

[3:24:23] dreamwalker213: @jackiechandaandsashabear not for 40 mount, just 60
[3:24:33] fourseti1234: normal mount for pally islitterly just like training it
[3:24:53] EKS90_: i go 5 parry.
[3:24:59] EKS90_: 1 second  on judgement is not worth IMO
[3:25:04] EKS90_: parry haste is nice
[3:25:14] EKS90_: yupp

[3:26:32] fourseti1234: fast weapons is right. slow weaponsis command
[3:26:33] Shugaze: situational
[3:26:38] WoW_StandalonE: Depends on weapon speed
[3:26:57] WoW_StandalonE: Slow weapon is good with SoC
[3:26:59] EKS90_: movement speed is huge, since vanilla is so much running + it helps you run away from mobs easier.
[3:27:02] Shugaze: SoC gamba proc time
[3:27:08] freetherocktv: @Towelliee isn't SoC for aoe and righteous is single target?

[4:04:10] pereadin: 24*365 for the rich people
[4:04:21] Nerendis: Most people play at PC Bangs, so paying for more than an hour is a waste of money.
[4:04:33] MereMortal: Wut? lol
[4:04:33] Nerendis: They can only play 1-2 hours a week in some cases. No home PC
[4:04:43] pereadin: yeah 43m is pocket change for them

[4:04:47] Allari: Probably what's gonna happen realistically

[4:04:52] hidetsugus2ndbaseman: Microsoft is buying blizzard the same way they bought Us nothing is going to stop them.
[4:05:02] Arashikaiju: Netease can sue for a bag of dickd to eat...

[4:06:08] Eviltuna13: I agree give them the money. I need a new store mount to cover the cost cohhFee
[4:06:13] sandychicken2: Where are they sueing them

[4:06:32] LX2_EXE: People are legally obligated to give money they raised for charities to the charity, doesn't mean they do it
[4:06:40] freetherocktv: @pereadin they have to come up with a new name KEKW
[4:06:44] Nerendis: I focus on International Law not Business Law, but there are ramification for Netease for sure
[4:07:01] Nerendis: @LX2_EXE I'm sure they enjoy the lawsuit then
[4:07:16] fourseti1234: thhrew a dart at a board lol
[4:07:17] Bernardo994: Do you really think china is looking out for the little guys?
[4:07:19] pereadin: @freetherocktv @freetherocktv lol why's that?
[4:07:26] Sayryn: They are adding extra for "Emotional Damange"
[4:07:37] Bernardo994: they'll keep the money
