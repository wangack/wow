[1:07:05] CrusaderNero: Decided to skip WotLK classic. Thats the xpac I played the most back in the day. Cant be bothered doing it again
[1:07:51] lucidakamaze: New players who buy boost have no idea what they're doing and people will complain and kick them. And questing in level 60 is alot harder than level 1. So they will qui eventually
[1:08:14] Thoreya: wow
[1:08:18] Thoreya: took look enough
[1:08:18] CrusaderNero: @xolowlifetwo if you are a brand new player, maybe they want to start at lvl 1

[1:09:11] MrGharr: I think the worst thing about the wow team is the big latency regarding answering to feedback
[1:09:20] NieIas: people want wrath how it was back then, not vanilla wrath lol
[1:09:26] Thoreya: idk feel like these things shud be obvious
[1:09:34] CrusaderNero: @xolowlifetwo if they are going to play with friends, they can get help and help eachother. Its not rocket science. Bit rough in the start, but get a few gear pieces aand..-
[1:10:01] Aierwin: They're doing the right think, making suggestions and taking feedback
[1:10:05] nathyrocka123: are u a wotlk player dude
[1:10:24] lucidakamaze: True
[1:10:29] generaljosh721: I think wrath made WoW more accessible to a broader audience of players and so there are a lot of fans that started playing in wrath and the dungeon finder helped with a lot of that imo
[1:10:47] CrusaderNero: dont really need to play 1-70 in order to get a grasp of your character. But, they could at the very least make a tutorial ground or something

[1:11:19] nathyrocka123: wrath had no dungeon finder till the end
[1:11:31] CrusaderNero: @feherlofia123 thats how it was back in the day too

[1:27:13] Eithos87: aoe looting was mop prepatch
[1:27:20] fjordizzle: I mean, even in BC classic you get a group and run the whole dungeon without saying a word to anyone so LFD would be just as it is now

[1:37:19] TheCliffyShow: The much hyped space murloc invasion.
[1:37:19] Thoreya: theyre all working on player housing LUL
[1:37:31] DegenerateHaven: they might work on it, but blizzard devs might be moved to another project so the total amount of hours spent on the game wont change, we dont know this information
[1:37:56] Thoreya: they quoted ybarra in that article saying they want to keep wow content coming at a good pace
[1:38:01] Thoreya: so i think its just an additional 100 ppl
[1:38:16] BlackS0L0: Morning towelliee how are you enjoying wotlk
[1:38:19] Angxlic: the game spellbreak averaged like 400 concurrent players for 2 years
[1:38:28] Rudric_Ice: this looks good for WoW man keep that content rollin
[1:38:29] mmo_kenna_: Spellbreak was a crap BR, I played Naraka last night which is Netease fantasy BR on Xbox and it's not bad
[1:38:30] Kriven: well the good thing is Mike Ybarra is a big wow fan he still raids and stuff
[1:38:33] generaljosh721: Usually when you get acquired, you still go through an interview process and some of them definitely wont pass the interviews
[1:38:35] Scoodles91: @generaljosh721 thats besicaly gurubashi arena :D
[1:38:41] Abizz: Just have them make 3 more BRF raids for DF
[1:38:43] TheCliffyShow: So, what does this mean for the game Spellbreak?\

[1:39:12] Rudric_Ice: @TheCliffyShow  spellbreak servers shutting down next year so its dead
[1:39:54] kirtyalex: what is that range wtf
[1:39:58] TheCliffyShow: @Rudric_Ice Oh, ok. I never played it. Was just curious.
[1:40:01] mmo_kenna_: Spellbreak was DOA, it was all mages you couldn't hit anyone because people flying all over the screen

[1:40:27] HaxzorJimDuggan: gonna dungeon level to 80 then do all this shit with flying at 80 and get all that gold
[1:40:28] Aquadriel: yeah
[1:40:35] Kriven: well they said they liked that they did fantasy and stylized art
[1:40:37] generaljosh721: Spellbreak had a lot of potential but the game just felt unbalanced and a bit clunky
[1:40:49] wraaith: coz the overwatch stuff safe to guess no real wow news today ?
[1:40:50] NieIas: they already had 300 orso? so now 400?
[1:40:56] Rudric_Ice: hope to see good PVP content
[1:41:07] MrGharr: how big is the wow team?
[1:41:34] generaljosh721: Spellbreak had balancing problems so I don’t know if we want them working on pvp lol
[1:41:39] Kriven: ahh diablo is fine they got vicarius visions a while back
[1:41:42] kirtyalex: they bring the most money to blizzard , wow team
[1:41:52] kirtyalex: or not anymore because of immortal
[1:42:15] Aquadriel: i mean the diablo franchise prolly has a team as big as WoW, considering they have literally 3 active games and their biggest one incoming lol
[1:42:18] generaljosh721: I feel bad for the D4 team.. immortal tarnished the IP
[1:42:32] toobaked1987: WoW is the life line of Blizzard 100%
[1:42:33] kirtyalex: Any info about the new IP they were talking about last year ?
[1:42:33] Rudric_Ice: now can blizzard acquire a 10 man company so that Hots gets some updates PepeHands
[1:42:38] ShrenTheOrc: lore lol i remember him from gamebreaker tv
[1:42:41] HuntingTurtle: whats the moral like atm @ blizz? from the media it seems like its really bad
[1:42:51] Nevindaz: pgeWow
[1:43:08] bypized: Bobby goes through WoW
[1:43:11] DegenerateHaven: makes sense then why there has been no content in any of their games since legion Kappa
[1:43:14] Rudric_Ice: WoW is the Mother of all their IP's
[1:43:18] generaljosh721: That’s why they are branching into mobile. They need to diversify
[1:43:24] generaljosh721: They need more cash cows
[1:43:36] MetaKuron: I'm still surprised there hasn't been a significant gold dupe exploit up until now with the WoW token being a thing
[1:43:39] TheCliffyShow: God, they need to make sandworn relics bind on account. I got so many and nothing to do with them.
[1:44:15] Korupcija_: TRUE
[1:44:35] generaljosh721: Aren’t these quests on wowhead and such?
[1:44:43] miinajj: 100%
[1:44:51] generaljosh721: MVPs
[1:45:02] generaljosh721: Also the people who find all of the hidden treasures lol
[1:45:06] a_demeaning_cow: I’m sure you’ve answered this question a ton already. Are you running duel wield frost spec for tanking too?
[1:45:08] Aquadriel: @Towelliee thats how awful quest design is in Howling fjord, even with quest helper is kinda funky, i lvld there recently KEKW
[1:45:28] Lincoln_WoW: was immortal was banned in china
[1:45:29] Rudric_Ice: @a_demeaning_cow yes he is
[1:45:34] Lincoln_WoW: i saw that rumor out there
[1:45:40] TombStoneMercenary: give me the tax from that and I would be happy
[1:45:45] cerealkillas22: fk Diablo immortal
[1:45:56] Lililithiumm: how long u been playig wow?
[1:46:11] HaxzorJimDuggan: im probably gonna pick up the diablo 3 expansion and necromancer in a few days since its on sale, just to mess around with until 4

[1:46:21] mintcookie_vajankle: oh god the old death knight abilities, the horrific rotations are all coming back to me
[1:46:27] druidiful: armor pen is great

[1:47:06] Nevindaz: do you think after the Dragonflight they will release a new wow vanilla mmo on another engine?
[1:47:45] warrenny: @nevindaz Yeah sire then blizz will relesse ffxv
[1:47:54] generaljosh721: @nevindaz unlikely WoW 2 will probably never come officially. Retail WoW IS wow2
[1:48:38] BoezIRL: is that rivendare?
[1:48:44] itsfabesz: They would probably lose subscribers because less people could run it?
[1:48:57] Rudric_Ice: wasn't titan changed to overwatch ?
[1:49:04] generaljosh721: WoW doesn’t need a realistic version
[1:49:12] generaljosh721: That’s part of the charm
[1:49:22] Aquadriel: i mean bfa feedback went 'missing' so.. KEKW
[1:50:10] cptrogers123: Wish i had the same passion for the game as you have. fact is that i just lost hope man...

[1:51:12] cptrogers123: Dragonflight better be a good expansion
[1:51:22] Rudric_Ice: the fact that ION talked to asmon made me feel that they are actually listening
[1:51:27] Rottencoarse: @Towelliee  yeah the mage writers from wowhead ahd a whishlist for talents couple days ago XD

[1:51:38] Musselwhite: How was Frost DK back then in WotLK ? I don't quite remember if it was good or not in dungeons

[1:54:02] toobaked1987: Towelliee just take us to Grizzly Hills so that good nostalgia can kick in.
[1:54:05] abracka_: howling fjord is great for scenery imo, just not better than boring tundra
[1:54:06] druidhex: HAve you experienced the Alliance side ever???
[1:54:15] cerealkillas22: howling fjord is slow asf
[1:54:45] Korupcija_: he is calling them monkeys every day KEKW
[1:55:09] Nevindaz: but still an asshole KEKW
[1:55:16] generaljosh721: Lol asmon has too much influence
[1:55:20] 63_undercover: hey guys how to get wotlk beta :D
[1:55:28] druidhex: The music ofHowling fjord is amazing

[1:55:53] ShrenTheOrc: mccuck said something about patchsniffer yesterday picking up 10.0

[1:56:03] Nevindaz: he also sayed he wants to talk with Bobby K bout the Diablo Imm situation KEKW
[1:56:06] CardinalTX: kinda full of himself these days
[1:56:12] toobaked1987: Asmon is now white skinny Oprea to me. Hardly touches a game anymore.
[1:56:13] xerrizz__: @Towelliee is frost tank atm lol
[1:56:19] HuntingTurtle: the devs have been pretty beligerent in the past tho
[1:56:46] Streamcrush: i feel like Asmon's content is moving past actually playing games
[1:56:54] generaljosh721: Cold blooded

[1:59:58] mrz_as: AngelThump
[2:00:00] stratiss: they just made a brand new UI for party finder, aint no way we getting LFD
[2:00:01] misterpain10: if they put that in it will ruin the game
[2:00:03] MrGharr: LDF fresh servers
[2:00:03] Etsku: i hate looking for groups for dungs

[2:01:01] Dalazos: LFG Is great for leveling and random HC's early in the expansion. You're still socializing doing raids and stuff.
[2:01:07] stjon13: PPl leave alot quicker w/ LFD
[2:01:15] HaxzorJimDuggan: if im talking in a dungeon, you done fucked up
[2:01:24] Rudric_Ice: but i want muh my classic experience in WOTLK Kappa
[2:01:24] stratiss: i think it's more about server community than anything
[2:01:36] NieIas: i want to play wrath how it was back then
[2:01:41] mmo_kenna_: Picky elitist system for heroics KEKW
[2:01:43] flebbooo: TRUE NotLikeThis
[2:01:46] cerealkillas22: LFD murders server community
[2:02:11] The_Dane_Train: Exclude heroics fine. But let everything else be LFD.
[2:02:11] Alienfromger: making friends? in wow? NotLikeThis
[2:02:13] Kriven: @cerealkillas22 cap
[2:02:14] mavericks312: and ppl on twitter act like there wont be any meta slaving in wrath with the lfg tool
[2:02:28] reggiepowa: oh pls no
[2:02:32] MrGharr: how good is the server community now in TBCC?
[2:02:32] mavericks312: @cerealkillas22 sstop thats a terrible take
[2:02:37] atrexy_: They are going too put quest helper back in they said in a blue post
[2:02:43] Doog45: ehh, when I started playing in wotlk, you learn who ppl are on your server even if you aren't friends with them, you don't really have that anymore, although I do agree group finder is more convenient
[2:02:44] mmo_kenna_: I get one hour to play wow per night, I wanna slap that button and go
[2:02:47] mintcookie_vajankle: M+ 1-10 should definitely be queueable
[2:02:57] mintcookie_vajankle: But stop after 10
[2:02:57] rewolFv: yeah and they could just make an ilvl requirement for those as well
[2:03:00] QuesoFM: remember when they said they were gonna update the lfg/lfm system in classic bc and they didnt and just added the one that was in bc
[2:03:00] Sacurra: I got rejected for M+ 1-3
[2:03:12] generaljosh721: They need a smarting skill rating system
[2:03:15] rathmanis: Will there addons that shows ppls Gear score/ilvl in the new premade finder???
[2:03:17] generaljosh721: Smarter*
[2:03:18] cerealkillas22: lol it's literally what happened to retail wow @mavericks312
[2:03:18] shamanianOG: Be sure to chuck a flower on the bonfire for the 3% crit buff
[2:03:19] CardinalTX: I want to be social!   but only with s tier players! Kappa
[2:03:20] stratiss: I get what they're going for, they want to encourage you to join a guild and make friends and run dungeons together.
[2:03:21] reggiepowa: @Mintcookielgfu definitely not, m+ should never be queueable
[2:03:24] Lefty79: Just to make sure before I start clearing bag space... no transmog in LK Classic, right? I know it came out in Cata... but just making sure.
[2:03:27] Scoodles91: +2/3 are the most picky ones.. :D
[2:03:36] mintcookie_vajankle: Yes it should
[2:03:55] QutipzTV: when did they actually add the quest helper in game thing
[2:03:58] mavericks312: @cerealkillas22 in retail you can atleast run heroics if you want with out the meta slaving
[2:04:02] LazyJared: Good morning @Towelliee how are you today?
[2:04:05] Streamcrush: honestly I feel like the most social modern WoW felt was before Blizz nerfed World Quest grouping in Legion
[2:04:11] toobaked1987: These old systems disappear for a reason. The ANALYTICS showed it was no longer working and needed to be improved.
[2:04:19] Korupcija_: gotta kill discord first
[2:04:20] Korupcija_: KEKW
[2:04:31] MrGharr: legion WQ grouping was nice
[2:04:31] ShrenTheOrc: lol im watching an old gamebreaker video of you talking about heroes of the storm
[2:04:44] PadidinJones: @Towelliee is it me or is your ground mount moving a bit slow?
[2:04:47] mavericks312: theres a reason why wrath was as huge as it was and its not cause it was like vanilla
[2:05:04] mintcookie_vajankle: Its cuz hes a Tauren lol
[2:05:05] tronbadgames: forced inconvenience creates frustration. If Blizzard wants to create frustration for us to be social, screw them
[2:05:05] Kman3107: What makes no sense it to make wotlk the same as retail........... To try something different, makes sense.
[2:05:06] silodin: looks like that because he thicc
[2:05:09] HaxzorJimDuggan: taurens always look slow on horses
[2:05:09] Doog45: idk what it is, but wotlk has a special place in my heart, just enjoyed it more than any other xpac so far and I didn't start playing till late in wotlk
[2:05:09] mintcookie_vajankle: It looks slow
[2:05:10] Dalazos: Looks slow, cause you're a fat tauren on a small horse lmao
[2:05:12] abracka_: taurens make mounts like that seem slow asf
[2:05:13] emznev: tauren making it seem slower kekw
[2:05:15] PadidinJones: Oh wait I think there is a Unholy talent to make it faster
[2:05:16] cerealkillas22: there is if they don't want to lose the same audience again that they lost before when they made those changes before in the past
[2:05:18] MrGharr: looks slower because Taurens are big
[2:05:20] Turet78: Ohh I just read about the Warcraft team expansion sounds great +100 people is huge.
[2:05:22] The_Dane_Train: They need to bring in updated retail AH too. That doesn’t go against any of their design pillars.
[2:05:37] CardinalTX: Man i remember......midnight in line at Gamestop waitinf for my Wrath copy.....good times
[2:05:44] The_Dane_Train: On a mega server the AH is frustratingly laggy.
[2:05:51] mavericks312: @cerealkillas22 there are more casuals that played wow then candies hate to break it to you
[2:05:57] mavericks312: wrath*
[2:06:04] Rudric_Ice: thats what healers do
[2:06:08] k1tzuneh: Is death knight that good in endgame?
[2:06:14] Kriven: you stay on your tanks booty with here
[2:06:15] Kriven: her
[2:06:17] toobaked1987: She can help support the backline from assassins trying to pick off squishys
[2:06:22] k1tzuneh: i feel like Demon Hunter is more better than Death Knight
[2:06:22] Streamcrush: I miss wrath unholy dk, so much fun

[2:06:37] mavericks312: wrath arcane mage was godly
[2:06:43] Urebaldd: Pepehand
[2:06:50] generaljosh721: They should change AH to FIFI instead of FILO for auctions of the same price to prevent cancel scanning constantly
[2:06:55] freetherocktv: @Towelliee Do you think it will be impossible to level a DK day 1 because of too many people making them?
[2:06:59] TombStoneMercenary: If people spamming mage boost 5k exp 60g 50+ mobs4 is the classic communities idea of communication and interaction that is a problem
[2:07:01] generaljosh721: FIFO *

[2:07:06] MrGharr: LiFo for the new AH seems bad, FiFo should be the standard.
[2:07:10] CardinalTX: @HaxzorJimDuggan Niiiiice.......ya me and a friend picked it up at midnight and then played all night
[2:07:18] PadidinJones: @Towelliee if you had kids like me my cuban bro, your hair would be grey and falling out

[2:08:16] UglyDogGaming: haha
[2:08:38] generaljosh721: Pretty sure OSRS uses FIFO for the grand exchange and that feels better than WoWs AH lol

[2:10:22] maxkule: !ALPHA
[2:10:22] Moobot: @maxkule PREDICTION JULY 14th | WoW 10.0 Alpha SOON TM: https://www.wowhead.com/news/dragonflight-internal-alpha-now-on-blizzard-catalogue-327322 | Quick reminder there are NO alpha keys! Alpha is invite only. Beta MIGHT have keys. We are a long ways away from Beta.
[2:11:01] silodin: `You need a large key for that cage
[2:11:10] Teknofear64: I remember those first few pulls in Azure were a little tough.
[2:11:17] MrGharr: !BETA
[2:11:28] generaljosh721: Socializing Pog
[2:11:40] silodin: random drop
[2:11:45] SpenceSir: I remember doing these quests years ago the first time around. Like it was yesterday
[2:11:57] radkkos: Dont forget to redo the epic sons of hodir questline :D
[2:12:35] mmrghost7: soloed Jailer gauntlet L7 , it was a brutal experience :/
[2:12:35] Rudric_Ice: fav dungeon in WOTLK has to be Oculus right tow Kappa
[2:12:41] vulkankragon: icy touch
[2:12:57] generaljosh721: Oculus is best dungeon Kappa
[2:13:24] kirtyalex: everything is dying so fast now LUL
[2:13:27] Aquadriel: next classic 'season' should be season of retail. Release classic with all QoL from retail, fast lvling, aoe loot, more flight paths and other shit just to see how the old game would run with modern standards.
[2:13:51] MrGharr: "Proletariat began working with the World of Warcraft development team in May and will be fully integrated into Blizzard Entertainment over the coming months."
[2:14:10] generaljosh721: Wait you have to manually refresh the dungeon finder list?
[2:14:19] Aquadriel: even more KEKW
[2:14:20] MrGharr: so the 100 new developers are already working on WoW
[2:14:40] mavericks312: for me adding all that would be fun to watch the candies riot lol
[2:14:43] PadidinJones: @Towelliee its your intro music! I miss the stream into stuff
[2:15:12] cerealkillas22: have all that QOL and dogshit classes, no thanks.
[2:15:21] magemaster225: the last time WoW team had a big employee influx was WoD >_>
[2:15:33] mavericks312: they probably wont be working on anything DF till like the .2 or .3 patch
[2:15:34] Aquadriel: prolly a few of them staying on support for SL and the rest are learning and helping on 10.1 onward
[2:15:50] MrGharr: if the 100 devs can accelerate patches by 1 months, that is huge success already.
[2:16:04] EitheraTV: just having t hem there to do the little stuff to free up the devs that know everything will be a huge help i think
[2:16:19] onybear: They are barely out of the orientation part of the job..
[2:16:56] Sarocus: It takes a pretty long time for a new employee to become productive
[2:16:58] Turet78: In the article they said from may but to integrate them it take a few more months remember WoW is a 17 year old code spaghetti to train new people to understand it may take more than a few months.
[2:17:03] mavericks312: also now we have Mike he isnt gonna throw ppl in to the fire day 1
[2:17:31] vulkankragon: how did they develop 4 major patches back in mop?

[2:17:48] Sarocus: And if they moved to CA from elsewhere, they're still dealing with the DMV :p
[2:18:19] magemaster225: theyre based in boston

[2:18:43] Dat_lorax: Well getting them in only in May seems a bit late then, unless they are prepping for mid to late expansion
[2:18:44] mavericks312: i wonder if blizz will make it optional to work in office or stay at home
[2:18:46] QuesoFM: cant be fully initiated untill youve done your first cubicle crawl
[2:18:58] mmo_kenna_: Slapped the newbies with the new talent system, there you go figure that shit out!
[2:19:03] HaloS23: @Towelliee feel like some that "WOW magic" was lost when people went remote.... i mean i know why but still...
[2:19:09] cerealkillas22: it's probably for the best you can't cube crawl if you aren't in the office
[2:19:29] Forestrunner201: Usually when you purchase another company you get everything. Then choose what you are going to sell off.
[2:19:51] Dat_lorax: Revisionist history @halos23
[2:20:11] LongSnapper99: That’s almost everywhere now. A lot of my friends their companies still work from home bc they realized people could get stuff done without going into the office.
[2:20:21] Turet78: @mmo_kenna_ I'm thinking the possible mont trees from the first day when they showed us how it will look and man I can't figure out some thing
[2:20:26] wyman1990vc: how many wow devs did they have before the new group from spellbreak?
[2:20:50] Cracksun98: 300 i think
[2:20:50] wyman1990vc: holy smokes
[2:20:52] NieIas: 250+ and now 350+
[2:21:00] Thoreya: nice little 33% increase
[2:21:10] HaloS23: @Dat_lorax not sure what that means
[2:21:24] Rudric_Ice: prolly around 400 i would assume
[2:21:25] wyman1990vc: that's good though like you said the future looks bright no more man power issues
[2:21:34] Korupcija_: I heard all of them work on housing Kappa
[2:21:38] MrGharr: I think they could really help with the class/talent balancing stuff.
[2:22:02] RhadigarTV: It makes me excited to see what they're going to do. Has there been talk of what's going to happen for world bosses yet in Dragonflight?
[2:22:22] MrGharr: Bughunting usually needs deeper knowledge so, not on that front.
[2:22:22] Moobot: Plans for WOTLK Beta. Some simple leveling and helping Blizzard test. At first there won't be a lot of people to do content with. That will change when 80 Template comes into play. OH and I don't have Beta keys ask Panda
[2:22:42] Rudric_Ice: those guys are getting trained by  Holinka for PVP
[2:22:42] magemaster225: I wonder if there was ever a scenario where Microsoft wanted to buy the spellbreak team before the activision deal, kinda funny
[2:23:10] RhadigarTV: Nice hat @Towelliee ;)
[2:23:16] mmrghost7: world bosses are irrelevant no one cares
[2:23:47] Thoreya: i saw blizz is also hiring someone for creating pvp battlegrounds
[2:23:47] Tanderstruk: @Towelliee tbh the Maw WB was legit
[2:23:53] wyman1990vc: did you get the dragonflight collectors edition?
[2:23:53] Thoreya: good to see theyre hiring in all aspects
[2:23:57] Harch: do you have OG vanilla collectors edition?
[2:24:15] wyman1990vc: like the box set
[2:24:22] Streamcrush: the physical edition comes with collectors pins
[2:24:27] magemaster225: the physical collectors one has pins, 5 of them
[2:24:39] wyman1990vc: oh nice that box art was incredible
[2:24:51] Elff11: That giveaway NAS only or also for EU?
[2:25:12] king_julian_96: Towelliee with these constant updates and dragonflight expected to come out this year do you think we get alpha this week or next week
[2:25:24] Joostisis: !skin
[2:25:38] maxkule: @king_julian_96 !ALPHA
[2:25:45] mavericks312: @king_julian_96 dont get to comfy with DF releasing this year lol
[2:26:36] JediNeo99999: @mavericks312 Based on what? Until people see the game in some state no one is really qualified to say what is going to happen
[2:26:41] Sielu11628: @king_julian_96 Only thing I can say is there have been two builds for 10.0 alpha so far this week (1 for WoWdev and the other for Wowvendor 3)
[2:27:07] wraaith: wraaith subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 11 months! still no beta for me :(
[2:27:08] mavericks312: @JediNeo99999 there isnt even an alpha yet and this xpac may need more testing then xpacs of past
[2:27:31] FutileDiploma: @towelliee did you play outriders. Kinda reminded me of a space Divison 2

[2:27:38] vulkankragon: @mavericks312 lots of microsoft games releasing next year like starfield, redfall, etc, also diablo 4. so the order to release the expac this year probably came from ms.
[2:27:50] SlamNSalmon: @towelliee is frost the tank spec in this beta, like it initially was in WOTLK release?
[2:28:01] mavericks312: @vulkankragon MS has nothing to do with DF
[2:28:02] JediNeo99999: @mavericks312 Literally means nothing. We have no idea where they are in dev.
[2:28:09] warrenny: @vulkankragon Microsft dont own blizz yet
[2:28:19] abracka_: what do you know? are you hiding something from us

[2:29:41] Templexx: nah the topic we are talking about

[2:31:00] thymos_: they didnt invite SWIFTY DansGame
[2:32:02] maxkule: @Towelliee Ok fine you cant give us the date. While playing in the Closed Alpha for DF are you enjoying your time? Also Happy Birthday.
[2:32:05] Korupcija_: only the biggest shills were invited
[2:32:46] thymos_: swifty shills all the time
[2:32:48] Seathasky: shills for what?
[2:33:01] Seathasky: for liking a video game?
[2:33:37] mavericks312: hows jokerd doin did he get in beta yet?
[2:33:42] thymos_: true KEKW
[2:33:45] SocioPET: Why are so many people complaining about no beta invites? The game comes out in a few months anyway
[2:33:50] falldrgn: did you just assume my Shillness... REEEE
[2:33:51] Seathasky: nothing wrong with that @Towelliee

[2:34:47] Quikbeard: I preorder every expansion. I give it an honest shot and if it’s good I stick around. Unfortunately the last two expansions I stopped playing within 2 months.
[2:34:51] d_elven_lord: "Everyone claims to be an outlaw, till it's time to do outlaw shit"
[2:34:55] SocioPET: @silodin its old currency from Autria
[2:35:01] CardinalTX: Shill is a term fools use when you dont dislike what they do
[2:35:06] SocioPET: or Swiss
[2:35:34] falldrgn: it just means they are advertising, trying to get you to buy  or use a product. like a famous person advertising X product
[2:35:36] AFKSammich: AFKSammich subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 87 months! 
[2:35:40] bypized: Is this the new EFT wipe update?
[2:35:47] MrGharr: because it became popular to hate everything.
[2:36:08] PokerFaceMoose: shill is only for when people are hiding that they are taking money from something. talking about something you like is not shilling.

[2:42:24] wraaith: speaking of speed runs did u see progression last night ?
[2:42:46] ToN1c: Could you quickly check if the achievement for completing random dungeonfinder groups is in the beta?
[2:42:48] wraaith: guild called progression set SWP speed run time
[2:42:51] Analfabestia: if they want to test raids, they should have given character templates at lvl 80 with some gear to test, in an instant lvl 80 test server
[2:43:02] Bowyn_: that's why they don't invite a bunch of people at first. they need people to not be able to form dungeon spams and focus on quests for testing
[2:43:07] wraaith: 34mins 50 seconds
[2:43:15] Coldfire989: @analfabestia those will come

[3:10:37] Benedito_Cremoso: whats the "4" spell?
[3:10:45] mysteriousm4n: Rune strike
[3:10:58] mysteriousm4n: it's like revenge for dk's
[3:11:13] vyjinx: overpower
[3:11:13] Awsmsauce: Overpower
[3:11:56] mysteriousm4n: overpower is when YOU get dodged, revenge+rune strike is when you dodge.
[3:11:57] Kakotan2143: hey @Towelliee are you playing a DK ?
[3:12:18] mysteriousm4n: wait maybe not
[3:12:20] Benedito_Cremoso: show build please?
[3:12:31] Shunji7723: @Towelliee are you enjoying the beta?
[3:12:42] swaefm: Bring Down Those Shields is going to be a bottleneck I think on launch. Only 4 crystal spawn, need to kill three, 3 min respawn
[3:13:16] Kakotan2143: @Towelliee what spec are you playing?
[3:13:51] buddybeerbruh: All good players start with boomie @Towelliee
[3:14:04] Kakotan2143: DPS ? Frost DK in Wrath was great DPS
[3:14:10] Velashen: I’m only doing wotlk so I can play my long lost blood dps spec.
[3:14:20] PhillyRhino: imagine...
[3:14:21] Moobot: Calm it with those symbols, @Kakotan2143 (warning)
[3:14:23] Bieflapjes: Or maybe more players in beta :p
[3:14:23] Kinghorn: or they could just invite some healers to the beta
[3:14:26] Kinghorn: bloobySmug
[3:14:34] IMegaHurtZI: Yeah I really don't understand why they didn't re-implement the Dungeon Finder as it was in WotLK
[3:14:38] Kakotan2143: @Velashen same
[3:14:46] Diamondead1: @Kakotan2143 frost is a tank spec in wrath
[3:14:51] HaxzorJimDuggan: you mean you rather not spend 30 minutes putting a group together to run a 15 minute dungeon
[3:15:01] fowlentv: they should add lfg at least for lvling imo
[3:15:13] Vendralos: good point
[3:15:16] Maldre: you can only see it, or only post if you are in queue?
[3:15:23] mintcookie_vajankle: Imagine being leveling in Sholazar Basin, spamming in 1. General that you need people for Halls of Stone that's in Storm Peaks
[3:15:40] RunningOutOfRAM: !brig
[3:15:47] RunningOutOfRAM: !skin
[3:15:49] Bieflapjes: So you have to sign up in group finder to see if people are looking for a group??
[3:15:49] Yanoru: Just go with LFD, cmon
[3:15:51] RunningOutOfRAM: !hat
[3:15:55] Kakotan2143: @Diamondead1 yes but it can be played as DPS with daggers
[3:16:00] mysteriousm4n: I'm just so flabbergasted why they won't just do Random Dungeon Finder and Quest helper, like it seems like changed it just for the sake of changing it
[3:16:11] IMegaHurtZI: How do you have 2 people queued as tank if you've got 2 warlocks and a rogue with you? LUL
[3:16:35] mysteriousm4n: Thank god
[3:16:42] HaxzorJimDuggan: i think a compromise is let people que for normal only and make heroic like this, just so people can level easier
[3:16:44] swaefm: It is East of Camp Winterhoof, straight east up a dirt road through a mountain
[3:17:03] Kakotan2143: Wrath was my most in-depth Expack until I burned myself out on farming my red dragon lol
[3:17:20] Yanoru: Yeah after Wotlk is done most likely
[3:17:22] maxkule: Not doing LFD seemed like a cop out because they didnt want to develop it and hit a deadline.

[3:18:31] mintcookie_vajankle: They might just add the original LFD later on after Ulduar like they did in 3.3
[3:18:41] Kriven: WoW bringing them in to clean the floors
[3:18:50] net_mi: they are coders
[3:19:12] Kakotan2143: But yeah, you can build a MEAN daggers FROST DK dps in Wrath, I loved my blood but my brother always out DPSed me on his FROST, that is why Frost was made DPS cause everyone was runing it then they switched it to 2 h weapons only :/
[3:19:18] mackoida: Was more thinking if they're real good at something special or something
[3:19:19] Loctite: Halls of Reflection
[3:19:30] Mecabeast: guild just killed heroic jailer last night so get to start mythic prog with pugs on Thursday

[4:32:33] player2two: how long is beta? debating if i should pay the $40 to get access
[4:33:26] bfjacke: not worth buying the beta. Even tho you like the game. Rly isnt worth.
[4:33:36] Kriven: @bfjacke thats cap
[4:33:45] mrpresbaby: @player2two I'd say at least until July 20th since that's when the promotion ends for skin
[4:33:48] Kriven: you get like 2 battlepasses outta it and skins
[4:33:51] BrowneePoints: don't forget your shotgun right click
[4:33:53] Kriven: so its worth
[4:34:27] yellowdmg: turret is always the best player
[4:34:39] Kriven: actually you get 3 battlepasses outta it
[4:34:43] ShadowDMG6969: Right click has about 6-8 meters

[4:35:29] ThePawPaw: 1 less player to play with and now 1 less tank idk i dont think ppl like it much
[4:35:34] Kriven: well its more shooter focused and now with less cc i find it better less shooting shields
[4:35:45] PUFFFFFFF: r u on default fov?
[4:35:46] ShadowDMG6969: 5v5 makes it that much more reliant for Tanks to be absolutely on top of their timing & SKill
[4:35:51] zechetto: They really needed to reduce tank protection uptaime, IMO...  that's why they made them stronger, but you can only have 1 now
