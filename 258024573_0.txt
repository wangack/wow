[6:45:10] bigstrongbattlejohn: its always done that and its common knowledge that tank needs to be the closest target to the boss when the cast finishes
[6:45:11] flickeringnova: It's simple guys, the bosses swing timer just happened to coincide with the exact time between the tank getting cc'd and the dot ticking to break it. If you had 200 iq like me this would be transparent.

[12:35:16] FaeyeLinn: @justayoungkappa Simply because pvp gets boring when it's always the same thing - you wear the other healer's mana out, then you win. Here, at least, you're looking at fighting creatures that are capable of just instantly jacking you over if you make a single mistake, which arena players can't do.
