[2:16:42] Iraerus: the bosses got an email saying their bonus is boosted by 4% due to inflation 💰
[2:16:44] nenoftw123: if you give a consent on the first contract that you are okay with increasing the price within the inflation range, they can
[2:16:44] struci: but I doubt that happened in this case
[2:16:59] Da5tupid1: lul
[2:17:02] enthaw90909: and if they do, the salaries will be increased at a given time

[2:18:28] 0mark0v: ^
[2:18:50] DjemDruid: i mean there's a very easy way to tell, if their profit margin is increasing when they hike prices it's not inflation
[2:19:04] DjemDruid: obviously they wouldn't make that public
