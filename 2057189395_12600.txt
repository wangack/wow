[3:33:47] Tipo227: It has game pass benefits, but its not in game pass

[3:33:54] Tipo227: nor xbox
[3:34:10] lordasriel2: stan is a big boy, need some muscles to carry him
[3:34:27] IIlSoralIl: stan is like sabotages the team by feeding enemy gold then farm to deal damage
[3:34:44] Drathaion: you telling me rito making this a pay to win?
[3:35:06] SturmGeist08: I wish I had any sort of clue of League
[3:37:07] SturmGeist08: I see food in the background SNIFFA fab let's steal Kaif's food

[3:44:16] IIlSoralIl: !who
[3:44:16] Nightbot: Kaif is playing WoW in the Season of Discovery servers with a bunch of people.
[3:44:56] fabulousemperor: !editcom kaif is playing LOL with Ben, Ebbz, Sazar and Stan
[3:44:56] Nightbot: @fabulousemperor -> There was an error updating the command. Error: command does not exist
[3:45:08] fabulousemperor: !editcom !who kaif is playing LOL with Ben, Ebbz, Sazar and Stan
[3:45:08] Nightbot: @fabulousemperor -> The command "!who" has been updated successfully.
[3:47:49] AwesomeInABox: doesnt shaco have a small slow on his backstabs
[3:48:42] SturmGeist08: Also don't think you saw my message when I talked with Nino about it some while ago, but Kaif anything I post in your fanart channel you are free to use. Don't really care about credit, I just enjoy making fanart for you. So if you see anything, feel free to just use it. Just wanna drop it because I am about to go to sleep, back hurts like shit
[3:49:12] SturmGeist08: Goodnight Kaif and chat, have a nice stream
[3:49:13] fabulousemperor: take care geist Bedge
[3:49:43] SturmGeist08: You too fab peepoHappy
[3:50:28] fabulousemperor: bork bork

[3:53:12] SturmGeist08: Watch me say I am going to sleep and then continue sitting in stream kaifW I don't feel tired but my back is murdering me
[3:53:37] fabulousemperor: kaifHmm go to sleep geist
[3:53:56] lilyerf: or maybe just watch laying down for less pain
[3:53:57] fabulousemperor: make sure you take care of yourself NODDERS
[3:54:34] SturmGeist08: Btw Kaif, small question. How do you handle wearing glasses with a headset? I am struggling to stay comfortable with my glasses and a headset. Been meaning to ask for a while
[3:55:01] SturmGeist08: @fabulousemperor But I am not tireddd
[3:55:37] lilyerf: In my experience it can be better with some headsets that are looser or different cushion material, his beanie may be helping it a bit too
[3:56:09] SturmGeist08: @lilyerf Tried it with a beanie too and it isn't working too well kaifTears
[3:56:15] meister_one: oh lord Kaif bullying enemy junglers again
[3:56:46] lilyerf: @SturmGeist08 Hmm, I've had problems with some headsets but not others so it could just be your headset/how thick the frames are
[3:57:05] Jima93: @SturmGeist08 Then your headset might be to tight
[3:57:07] Ghost47141: was doing great with smolder mid but they fed the eve
[3:57:25] SturmGeist08: @lilyerf The frames are rather thin, but I could try it with a different headset
[3:57:47] lilyerf: that or just loosen it that could help too if it has that adjustment available
[3:58:57] SturmGeist08: @lilyerf I don't think it does. It was a 80 buck headset but it doesn't have much adjustable shit kaifDerp I have been thinking of getting a wireless headset anyway
[3:59:55] lilyerf: Wireless headsets can be nice so long as they have enough battery life. I'm surprised it can't size adjust tbh
[4:01:24] SturmGeist08: Oh shit wait, I think I can't get a wireless headset. My pc was also hella expensive and it has everything, but wireless compatibility. That's the only thing it's fucking lacking and it's so frustrating
[4:02:18] lilyerf: idk about all wireless headsets but mine has a charging base that plugs into the PC and is how it connects, and if you want a bluetooth one there's definitely ways to give your PC that compatibility
[4:02:27] lordasriel2: wireless headsets usually come with a dongle don't they?
[4:02:43] SturmGeist08: @lilyerf Isn't everything that runs on batteries now made to be shitty with long battery life?
[4:02:56] Ghost47141: slow start for kindred
[4:03:27] lilyerf: @SturmGeist08 it'll just depend on where you're looking
[4:03:45] lordasriel2: kaif got blueballed hard there
[4:03:55] Jima93: Dont u need an agressive/hige dmg support for a Kindred adc so you can get those stacks?
[4:03:57] fabulousemperor: bork bork
[4:04:43] SturmGeist08: @lordasriel2 Don't have much space for more usb stuff kaifTears  Drawing tablet and my external hard drive for my drawing stuff take too many slots. Had all my artwork wiped before
[4:04:59] TDesius: Do you need a hug? LUL
[4:05:16] SturmGeist08: Heya Desius peepoHey
[4:05:16] fabulousemperor: I think so desius kaifW
[4:05:17] lordasriel2: @SturmGeist08 you're pc only has 2 usb slots? or do you have a ton of external drives?
[4:05:20] lilyerf: @SturmGeist08 oh fair that would be a problem then with using wireless
[4:05:47] SturmGeist08: @lordasriel2 Oh nahhh, just keyboard and mouse take up the other slots
[4:06:05] TDesius: I will add it to the Owe's Kaif a hug pile for when I see you next LUL
[4:07:44] TDesius: Inting Viego? LUL
[4:07:50] TDesius: New replacement for Sion
[4:08:04] TDesius: Or Draven
[4:08:07] TDesius: Draven also does it
[4:09:30] SturmGeist08: Goddamm I just noticed it's almost 4am in my timezone. Time really flies by
[4:10:17] Macavalia: Sadge
[4:11:12] lordasriel2: gobin toaster?
[4:11:14] Macavalia: offt iron, hard climb
[4:11:25] TDesius: You gained 31lp, then lost 31lp, was that because you couldn't lose more than the 31? LUL
[4:11:30] fabulousemperor: best toaster confirmed NODDERS @lordasriel2
[4:11:31] madferret10: uno reverse stan uno reverse
[4:11:50] SturmGeist08: Food SNIFFA
[4:11:59] fabulousemperor: SNIFFA
[4:12:01] lilyerf: I think the question was more was that because you couldn't go any lower with that loss
[4:12:04] Destin_the_Insane: @TDesius I imagine you meant because he only had 31 lp to lose.
[4:12:05] TDesius: Quickly now get ahead of him LUL You're ahead by 6lp LUL
[4:12:08] SturmGeist08: @fabulousemperor Agreed, goblin toaster is best toaster
[4:12:12] TDesius: @Destin_the_Insane Exactly
[4:12:27] TDesius: Can't wait for Nia to do her Ranked Matches
[4:12:30] TDesius: LUL
[4:12:40] Jima93: Sounds like skill issue
[4:12:45] Macavalia: if youve been ranked before you'll almost always get ranked close to that previous rank or lower
[4:12:49] TDesius: Kaif
[4:13:00] TDesius: Maybe theres a way to escape your ELO Hell
[4:13:02] TDesius: LUL
[4:13:07] Macavalia: fuck
[4:13:10] SturmGeist08: Now I want cookies, but I have no cookies kaifTears
[4:13:18] rarichi_ii: Sadge
[4:13:22] TDesius: I mean we just gotta hit level 30 again
[4:13:23] TDesius: LUL
[4:13:31] Macavalia: brand jungle is still insane atm
[4:13:59] lordasriel2: if you care about stan falling than you climbing, i can sink him lol
[4:14:09] lordasriel2: *more than
[4:14:58] TDesius: Honestly I've said this before
[4:15:06] Macavalia: is it only showing their flex rank?
[4:15:15] TDesius: They need to completely purge all MMR and Previous Ranks. And start everyone at Iron 4 Base
[4:15:18] Macavalia: ohh
[4:17:51] Jima93: Never trust the ranks as my unranked ass have went up vs emerald in quickplay and had a good game
[4:18:03] TDesius: So Morde - Bronze 4 Solo, Shaco - Bronze 1 Solo, Jhin was Gold/Plat Solo last season, Kog - Bronze 2 Solo and Karma Bronze 4 Solo
[4:18:34] TDesius: But there's your information LUL
[4:19:11] TDesius: It's cause you see the Flex Ranks
[4:19:13] TDesius: Instead of Solo
[4:19:40] Macavalia: it should show solo ranked over flex. its more accurate
[4:19:40] TDesius: Why are you playing Bastion but in LoL
[4:20:12] TDesius: Viego has very basic skins
[4:20:15] TDesius: Not gonna lie xD
[4:20:41] Jima93: Viego is very basic champ
[4:20:57] Macavalia: KEKL
[4:21:23] lordasriel2: sejauni got revenge
[4:21:41] fabulousemperor: what
[4:21:45] Macavalia: making a new account is the way to climb tbh
[4:21:50] TDesius: LUL
[4:21:59] TDesius: It really is
[4:22:04] SturmGeist08: Since lights out didn't seem to make it into custom lobbys, will you and the boys play in none custom lobbys on Sunday in DbD or don't play the new mode in favor for custom lobbys?
[4:22:06] TDesius: Our accounts are bound by old old MMR
[4:22:11] Sustenance__: yeah new accounts get like gold. i think riot wants the smurfs out fast
[4:22:17] Macavalia: i made a new account after being hard stuck silver/gold and got plat
[4:22:27] madferret10: problem is though when you hit gold as a new player you reach a harsh reality that you dont belong
[4:22:36] TDesius: Honestly not gonna lie, I think Smurfs had a massive impact on the current ranking issues
[4:22:37] Rylie395: then there's my dumbass perpetually gonna be in iron
[4:23:07] TDesius: Smurfs were tanking a second account to just roll bronze players. So Riot made it harder to "Start" there
[4:23:11] TDesius: So they hopefully give up
[4:23:34] lordasriel2: i'd find out if im in iron or bronze, but i dont have a group to play with and solo is a nuthouse
[4:24:40] TDesius: Remember the Garen we went against that felt like he just only installed the game, and got ranked Plat after our match LUL
[4:25:00] Nightbot: No BSG or meta gaming. Don't try telling Kaif what he should do, how he should play. Unless he specifically asks help from chat.
[4:25:20] TDesius: Like he genuinely was and FELT like a new player. He behaved like one and struggled to do anything. And boom
[4:25:23] TDesius: Here's Plat
[4:25:24] TDesius: LUL
[4:26:12] lordasriel2: have you thought about playing heroes of the storm?
[4:26:16] IIlSoralIl: probably he played a similar game and just not use to the game yet
[4:26:18] Rylie395: still gotta work up the nerve to play more solo
[4:26:39] Macavalia: im makikng a new account, ill report back my rank placements in due time
[4:26:48] TDesius: Did Sazar just miss two champions with a laser? LUL
[4:26:54] fabulousemperor: kaifW
[4:27:23] lordasriel2: i certainly saw a grub tank that shot
[4:27:23] TDesius: Sazar also threaded the needle of 2 characters with his laser LUL
[4:27:31] SturmGeist08: of course when I looked away to open my drawing program something interesting happens
[4:27:36] DMoney7896: are you sure
[4:27:44] faroeseprik: think you smited one of those minions
[4:27:48] madferret10: @TDesius actually an achievement tbh harder to miss than hit
[4:28:02] lordasriel2: time for someone to get the clip!
[4:28:03] Drathaion: do we need to check the tapes?
[4:28:15] IIlSoralIl: lets just say you didn't
[4:28:59] IIlSoralIl: maybe the health is 0.01% but it rounddown to 0%
[4:29:00] TDesius: OH I know what it was LUL
[4:29:01] Jima93: It must have been 0.1hp or something like that
[4:29:15] TDesius: It hit 0 Health from the Laser. And it has a delay on popping to give the buff to the other one.
[4:29:23] TDesius: But Sazar got the last hit and your smite was wasted
[4:29:36] TDesius: So Sazar got the Killing blow, not your smite.
[4:29:40] TDesius: Your smite just went to the voice
[4:29:44] TDesius: Void*
[4:29:46] TDesius: LUL

[4:30:24] fabulousemperor: du du dululu
[4:30:27] Daffen_Prime: hiya FAB
[4:30:34] fabulousemperor: hiya dafffen peepoHey
[4:30:48] Daffen_Prime: hows there games been?
[4:31:10] TDesius: TLDR : Sazar killed it, it hit Zero. It delayed the death as it passed the buff/shield over, Your smite hit it but passed onto the grub to the left of it and did damage there LUL
[4:31:27] fabulousemperor: 1-1 so far daffen, W/L
[4:31:43] TDesius: LUL
[4:31:46] fabulousemperor: kaif was scammed NODDERS
[4:31:57] TDesius: ALSO
[4:32:01] TDesius: There you go in Boys chat
[4:32:04] arcwinds: omg salt raiders on league? So excited. It will be a fortune in salt.
[4:32:06] Daffen_Prime: so its sazars doing
[4:32:27] lordasriel2: could also be due to ping diff between kaif and sazar, if the server registered that the beam would hit before kaif's smite
[4:34:12] TDesius: @SR_Kaif I left you a present in The Boys chat LUL
[4:34:52] Daffen_Prime: @SR_Kaif  did u know that if you have 6 stacks of benis bois when u use shelly he spawns a large ammount of babies
[4:35:04] Rylie395: @TDesius oh no, the fuck did you post?
[4:35:22] Rylie395: oh ok, good
[4:35:29] Rylie395: no more cursed content like this morning
[4:35:41] TDesius: I'm not the cursed content provider Rylie LUL
[4:35:43] fabulousemperor: oooo
[4:35:56] Rylie395: @TDesius fair enough, but I have been traumatized
[4:36:03] IIlSoralIl: sazar is one of those people where they see low health, they just attack
[4:36:08] lordasriel2: kaif hit double digits on lvl and it went straight to his ego
[4:36:12] Rylie395: seen some shit
[4:36:35] arcwinds: I mean you have no stacks on Smolder. Most of his damage does come from his stacks
[4:36:58] TDesius: Kaif you became what you hate
[4:36:59] TDesius: LUL
[4:37:43] TDesius: Kaif's being a little goblin right now
[4:38:09] lordasriel2: spend da money and become buff!
[4:38:16] lordasriel2: then clown on them more
[4:38:40] FonzieZombie: god damn that was allot of cash
[4:38:56] OGCatfud: OGCatfud subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 14 months! Kaif!  hope you're doing well!
[4:39:28] madferret10: has sazar hit a single ult this game LUL ?
[4:39:36] lordasriel2: once
[4:39:44] lordasriel2: maybe twice
[4:40:17] TDesius: The only real downside to Viego is one thing
[4:40:49] TDesius: You have to learn/know or at least understand the basics of like 160 champions basic abilities. LUL
[4:41:17] IIlSoralIl: probably is when he steal kills
[4:41:21] lordasriel2: i mean, sounds like a cheap way to learn the basic kits of 160 champs
[4:41:58] TDesius: Sylas has to learn 160+ Ultimates, Viego has to learn 480+ Basic Abilties LUL
[4:42:10] arcwinds: Dont forget about passives
[4:44:00] TDesius: It's cause Flex doesn't take into account Solo/Duo, and Vice Versa.
[4:44:34] TDesius: Do I need to go see if I can find that Garen? LUL
[4:45:46] Daffen_Prime: was that mass effect
[4:46:02] SturmGeist08: Remi in her bed
[4:46:27] lordasriel2: it's weirdly hot in my room and i don't know why
[4:47:12] SturmGeist08: Kaif getting distracted by chat
[4:47:16] lordasriel2: and you won, so maybe that's the strat?
[4:47:33] Daffen_Prime: also cant believe ive been watching you for such a long time alrdy kaif
[4:48:17] GawdAwfulGamer: Yay, I'm a pog frog
[4:48:19] lordasriel2: who is that?
[4:48:30] Daffen_Prime: its Joe
[4:49:31] lordasriel2: not one ive heard before. the only joe i know of being in sr is the one that made a fat joke about glen when they played bread and fred
[4:50:12] Daffen_Prime: what u never heard of Joe Biden
[4:50:40] Drathaion: didn't sound like muh president
[4:51:28] Daffen_Prime: hiya drathaion
[4:51:31] wagicalwizard: Surprised to see you play this
[4:51:54] Daffen_Prime: something something look at his 1st video posted on YT

[4:52:51] ItsInksy: Soap tea. A Louisiana specialty.
[4:52:52] Daffen_Prime: im Canadian
[4:52:59] Drathaion: he found out soap tea?
[4:53:10] DMoney7896: ??
[4:53:16] lordasriel2: maybe lipton or somethin? i tried that instant sweet tea shit once and it was terrible
[4:53:20] Drathaion: one sec let me google did
[4:53:22] wagicalwizard: Im American and all tea I think just tastes bad
[4:54:08] Nightbot: No BSG or meta gaming. Don't try telling Kaif what he should do, how he should play. Unless he specifically asks help from chat.
[4:54:12] Daffen_Prime: its the same thing
[4:54:17] Blanker42117: id say lipton does taste like soap
[4:54:27] Daffen_Prime: it has 3 names
[4:54:39] lordasriel2: if you've only had sweet tea or anything with the word lipton on it, i can believe it. had some mint tea from teavana that wasn't too bad, just expensive
[4:55:04] Blanker42117: true
[4:55:10] CoverOfWar: Both cilantro and coriander come from the Coriandrum sativum plant. In the US, cilantro is the name for the plant's leaves and stem, while coriander is the name for its dried seeds. Internationally, the leaves and stems are called coriander, while its dried seeds are called coriander seeds.
[4:55:32] Daffen_Prime: coriander/cilantro some times also get reffered to chinse parslly
[4:55:45] Drathaion: thats what the google said it was earl grey
[4:56:01] lordasriel2: it could've been a very cheap earl grey then. tea isn't that big over here so the easily accessible (aka cheap) stuff isn't gonna be all that great
[4:56:03] GawdAwfulGamer: I just have some imported tea my boss got me for insomnia. It's pretty amazing
[4:56:06] SeraMeyr: yeah, and parsley is the same family as coriander/cilantro, and people get them mixed up too, but the difference is in the round/sharpness of the leaves. Cilantro has rounder leaves
[4:56:16] colin12222222: yoo how are you!!

[5:21:34] Ghost47141: its the games hidden lp crap, just want to keep u in that elo as much as possbile
[5:21:36] ItsInksy: LP generally depends upon the level of your opponents so the MMR system must've thought these folks were worse than the others
[5:22:26] ItsInksy: I will forever consider Riot a failed company until I see KDA Gragas
[5:22:48] Ghost47141: how was hell divers 2?

[5:32:55] DragonGold121: @SR_Kaif Make a bet on if you win this game/round
[5:33:03] DragonGold121: with channel points
[5:33:42] ItsInksy: Getting dragons against Shyvanna is always a good idea. Denies a lot of her late-game scaling
[5:35:19] drdan216: Curse you kaif you made me verify my account so I can talk in one of my favourite content creator's stream.

[5:39:12] IIlSoralIl: is it a thing where top laners like lolis?
[5:39:42] drdan216: the joke is that there was a certain top/jax main was sorta a pedo
[5:39:53] ItsInksy: I always thought Dravens were racist
[5:39:56] ItsInksy: Specifically gladiator
[5:40:50] ItsInksy: I've also heard Kassadin mains are racist, but I cannot confirm that claim
[5:41:41] drdan216: Generally any hard carry champ has some joke about being toxic or racist
[5:41:58] Daffen_Prime: what about pools under tibers
[5:42:13] drdan216: the pools are from the new item malignance
[5:42:22] ItsInksy: @Daffen_Prime When Tibbers punches people they piss themselves so it forms pools under their feet
[5:42:31] Daffen_Prime: oh i just used that as AP kog ma
[5:42:48] drdan216: DRIFT KINGU

[5:51:34] Satasin: Ooh this is a very late strem
[5:52:34] PidgePlum: True gamers lean into their movement LUL
[5:52:40] ItsInksy: You should see me when I play killer on DBD. I lean forward every time I lunge and then I catch myself.
[5:52:43] PidgePlum: I used to duck playing Battlefield and stuff
[5:53:39] ItsInksy: It does feel a bit odd that a Shyvanna didn't get a single dragon all game
[5:54:14] fabulousemperor: Clap
[5:54:40] Warlock2232: HUH
[5:55:04] ItsInksy: Well, I'm gonna hit the hay. I've got a haircut appointment in a month and a half Kappa

[6:01:39] ItsInksy: MAD RESPECT STAN!
[6:02:49] drdan216: you guys should check out blood on the clocktower, social deduction game I got to play recently that's phenomenal, totally different from any of the others I've played.
[6:04:18] ItsInksy: Surprised to see a Nocturne ganking early. Always thought you wanted to powerfarm until level 6 then focus on ganks.
[6:04:40] zeviika: a weird social deduction game i discovered recently is something that came out of China. lot more in depth and all called Jubensha. surprised there are a lot of jubensha shops here in the states
[6:05:24] ItsInksy: He's literally trying to take Ben's boys FROM BEN
[6:05:27] ItsInksy: The nerve
[6:05:55] zeviika: its like a larp with it , more in person
[6:06:01] drdan216: blood on the clocktower is played in person
[6:06:47] zeviika: oh maybe they have been making some recently, its been pretty popular. i'll have to look into that then
[6:06:56] ItsInksy: I just noticed the mid matchup. THE LORE!
[6:07:41] zeviika: are we in Diamond yettt
[6:08:33] drdan216: blood on the clocktower leads to the most chaotic scenarios though, had a game where the evil person was fully convinced they weren't evil.
[6:10:14] Toastarcher: aesthetically nocturnes gotta be my favorite
[6:12:53] zeviika: no voice changer for ebbz now Sadge
