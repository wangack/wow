[2:22:47] TheGaoSora: Imagine if they'll ban Mike for selling boosts KEKW
[2:22:49] mavericks312: @abdarahyin hardly
[2:22:54] Kazgrax: I'm actually excited
[2:22:55] Moobot: Calm it with those symbols, @SilkMaster (warning)
[2:22:57] MILESkg21: TRUE

[2:23:21] Layercake: Phil Spencer plays a lot of games...he was on Drop Frames 2 times...he is a gamer
[2:23:22] MaxGrandpre: It's such a good news
[2:23:22] Neodorian_: The hivemind loves to hate
[2:23:26] Streamcrush: I'm not a fan of Microsoft hoovering up every company but this definitely helps Blizzard escape the pressures from Activision
[2:23:27] Lanfrogx: best thing since the merger of acti blizz thats for sure.   it could either be good, or remain the shitty way its been  for years now. i welcome the change.
[2:23:28] N3llee: its the unknown people fear/worry about
[2:23:28] DVaderCY: So happy abouu what?

[2:23:37] jalloppy: @Towelliee have Neri up on alliance my guy if you want it
[2:23:37] SSD511_: Hope this change worth
[2:23:39] jamarky23: Please explain why we should be happy... What does this mean for wows future content?
[2:23:40] Vykenos: @Towelliee what do you think the long term will be for battlenet?
[2:23:40] Rexialiton: @sgtalash as always KEKW
[2:23:41] Malarick: best move for Blizz since Activision bought Blizz from Vivendi
[2:23:42] Kisswani: I am clueless about laws , but Jason Schrier was saying something about anti-trust laws , no idea what that means tho
[2:23:44] abdarahyin: Acti-Blizz got that Microsoft DADDY MONEY! We gettin WoW 2.0! Warcraft, Starcraft, Lost Vikings, and MORE all brought back <3

[2:23:47] xXSiebzehnXx: SCRAMBLE
[2:23:47] swordart_19: IT was time savings chat ?
[2:23:48] Jarlan23: orisa?
[2:23:48] MuttonChopins: reddit is saying WoW in Gamepass
[2:23:49] wEiRdO_dUdE: If they do put it on Xbox, that's more players. More growth
[2:23:50] rime2: @thebluelantern blizzard is on life support so its not that bad blizz wise
[2:23:51] MILESkg21: Remove the TOKEN and we good
[2:23:52] stickorewitz: so its not unlikley that wow will be on but not the latest expansion or something like that
[2:23:54] KingsandClubs: Imagine in a few years amazon buys nintendo or sony or both HUGEEEE
[2:23:55] UNSUNG_HER0: why is wow down for 8 hours today?
[2:23:58] sotopopp: Assuming that they are expecting a ten year return, only counting subs, they ned to boost numbers to roughly 39 million subs
[2:23:58] pixlbunz: Why does my message get deleted when all I did was paste a name??
[2:24:00] unborngiraffe: Bobby and Phil Spencer are on CNBC now
[2:24:01] NewWorldReign: @Towelliee what do you think about Microsoft owning WoW etc?
[2:24:03] TheRiwen: I dont like microsoft That is why.

[2:24:10] Theduskflyer: Plot twist, he‚Äôs always played WoW. He bought acti/blizz so he could finally loot Invincible. @towelliee
[2:24:16] Jodicus: Listen it was going to be Tencent or MS that bought them. Take your pick.
[2:24:17] HaxzorJimDuggan: Bellular is even positive about this, thats insane LUL
[2:24:19] anassm003: Is it worth buying into activision blizzard now? lol
[2:24:20] ShowDUH: June 30th
[2:24:24] Ambersulfr: LET'S WATCH
[2:24:28] pankeysz: Why is it good news though @Towelliee?
[2:24:33] medanmarko: Again, I respectfully disagree. Less competition is never good for any industry. MS now has even more control over large corporations. We will see less innovation and progress for game titles as large corporations are interested ONLY in money and returns, profits etc. The salvation for the gaming industry remains in indie devs.
[2:24:34] swordart_19: YEP chat is full of Pepega
[2:24:34] Sollice: @SilkMaster Because you did a bunch of symbols..dont
[2:24:35] Artumes87: When is Phil getting his NPC

[2:25:00] youzeon: WOW IS SAVED
[2:25:00] TheRiwen: I hope for the best for wow
[2:25:02] Capt_: Arguably the best thing that could have happened to Activation right now.
[2:25:03] TheZofren: There's a small negative that more monopolization is a bad trend in the industry
[2:25:04] Lanfrogx: true lmao
[2:25:06] Boomthistle: They say in 2023 they are going to try an put as many blizz games on gamepass which is great news
[2:25:10] JelyGG: is overwatch 2 saved now?
[2:25:10] AwerageGuy: "Microsoft has confirmed that controversial Activision Blizzard CEO Bobby Kotick will remain in his position after it acquires the company."
[2:25:11] Sch1ey: god damn.
[2:25:11] Hayon5: EZ
[2:25:11] BobLongMVP: Uhhhhh no... lol
[2:25:12] Colt_Engineer: KEKW
[2:25:13] youzeon: WOW HATER HAVE LOST
[2:25:14] fistofnature: just a bigger monopoly for microsoft its not good for the industry
[2:25:14] sifer007: KEKWlaugh
[2:25:15] TSquadSully: maybe they'll finally fix overwatch too lol
[2:25:16] twinkieruler95: @Towelliee i really think that wow will be better with all that money coming now
[2:25:17] zerkx1: until WoW 2 is released in 2023
[2:25:17] stallowned: im glad they got away from activition and xbox is the better console
[2:25:18] abdarahyin: Phil Spencer <3
[2:25:18] othraerir: no dab bro
[2:25:18] Shrenko: he did it
[2:25:19] Thoreya: seriously fuck outta here with that negativity
[2:25:19] HardlyAaron: I'm more hopeful for Blizz games than I've had in 6 months. Nervous for some employees jobs.
[2:25:20] mrpires_: it is good for blizzard games for sure, monopoly is bad though
[2:25:20] mavericks312: xbox doesnt have a great track record aquiring big title games... ask bethesda
[2:25:21] Thoreya: theres the door
[2:25:22] anassm003: @anassm003 But no way its actually going down more than it is now right?
[2:25:23] Ivixia: Hots saved? PogChamp
[2:25:23] youzeon: YES TELL THEM
[2:25:23] pixlbunz: @sollice I'd appreciate it if yo read the message the name was the symbols but yeah you know be like that
[2:25:24] SlowMoJoe_TV: Not at all lol. Monopolies are bad for consumers
[2:25:24] drunken_panda86: Anybody here knows what keyboard is Towelliee using ?
[2:25:28] jamarky23: No i love wow and want it to be as good as it can be but you keep talking about game pass yes... but what does it mean for actual content?
[2:25:28] badikar: I was hopeful that Bobby would get replaced, so the creative teams for Blizz would have new leadership. Curious how directly a role Phil will have with Bobby still in his role.
[2:25:29] Trustkill11: Can someone photoshop fill as a Paladin?
[2:25:30] funKShun: Microsoft says the Activision Blizzard deal is expected to close in FY2023.
[2:25:31] sgtalash: i got this mount firts try
[2:25:31] MILESkg21: monopoly wise its bad
[2:25:33] TheRiwen: I hope the best for wow. But microsoft has a bad rep with games
[2:25:33] RingoDingoDoo: the lack of critical thinking from this streamer is astonishing, how is the homogenization of competitive choice a good thing?
[2:25:33] ItsXolten: I can't be the only one who just went and bought Activision/Blizzard stock right? LMAO
[2:25:35] cronymahoney: stocks going up
[2:25:36] its_andyd: Copium
[2:25:37] pankeysz: What makes this good news though? Not being a downer or anything just truly unaware.

[2:25:45] TheGaoSora: Please danCopium
[2:25:46] eyemyor: For Blizz, this is awesome.  For MS, this is awesome.  For other gaming companies, its going to hurt a bit.
[2:25:46] youzeon: WOW WILL REPEAK AGAIN
[2:25:46] Supwizy: They didn't even mention HoTS KEKW
[2:25:47] zgag: Not sure what the problem is. Activision was the main issue, not Microsoft. Most players had issues with Activision way before the lawsuit.
[2:25:47] Ivixia: Pog
[2:25:47] t_train_va: I only hated on Blizz because of the treatment of employees. Assuming there is actual change, I wish them well

[2:25:52] Sollice: @AwerageGuy Everything is subject to change. They don't even own the company yet so whatever they say doesn't matter. Plus it could be contractual things and they don't want to pay him out....yet
[2:25:52] Korupcija_: they didn't even include it
[2:25:52] Syghtless: on console then? @Towelliee
[2:25:53] joncena: wow on console
[2:25:53] Lanfrogx: hopefully phil doesnt milk the game for all its worth. I think this will be good overall! but what direction microsoft goes... that will b the decicding factor.

[2:27:53] jerexify: @Towelliee New legendary warrior weapon - energy sword.
[2:27:55] Dinokaze: @Towelliee While this might improve WoW, monopolies stifle competition. We really need trust busting instead of every company combining into one massive "overlord of all"
[2:27:56] cybx89: !microsoft

[2:28:05] CYRUS_DH: i already have 2 years of gamepass so i win on it
[2:28:07] ryptrs: Microsoft will make WoW better for sure this time :) all seriousness I hope it's a positive impact on Blizzard cause it seems they need it
[2:28:08] trevomancho: @Towelliee the only thing that will change we will se the ms. logo next to blizard it will become from activision blizard to MS. Blizard

[2:28:09] Artumes87: PC Game Pass is $10, so it's cheaper
[2:28:11] dyslexican1: Yes but game pass with wow included is a WAY better deal.
[2:28:12] amricatt: @joshwalk8814  No worries!  If you haven't ever had your company bought, or buy something else, you may not know.  It's easy to assume the worse with these things.
[2:28:14] NewWorldReign: Does this mean WoW will be on the X-Box or staying with the MMORPG route as always?
[2:28:14] alextheory_: with better value tho
[2:28:15] MILESkg21: Julia that would be great LuL
[2:28:15] UNSUNG_HER0: so you cant buy a sub with gold anymore??????
[2:28:17] jin_sensei: @Sollice Im saying this because Bethesda already said future games wont be on Ps anymore
[2:28:18] mytherel: holy shit is anyone listening to bobby right now
[2:28:19] kyr_slowbro: Game Pass > Sub
[2:28:21] CYRUS_DH: its insane value for me

[2:28:36] TheGaoSora: @youzeon Unfortunately nothing can beat League atm.. it'll take a MAJOR slip by Riot for something like that to happen..
[2:28:40] Basic_BS: Great value
[2:28:42] NotEnoughMana: the value is insane
[2:28:47] tb3763: Microsoft doesnt want WOW they want COD
[2:28:48] jalloppy: @Towelliee have nerissa on alliance ready to pull if you need it my guy
[2:28:50] fancyjoe: sad bobby still in charge though
[2:28:53] mytherel: ready player one is happening....
[2:28:54] Sollice: @jin_sensei Yeah I mean it is a possability. That being said that could do more damage than good for MS if they pulled everything from PS
[2:28:54] ghost97tt: It doesnt make money from subs though??
[2:28:55] pronkk_: didnt you just kill nerissa on this toon?
[2:29:01] SicDogg: its all about money

[2:29:09] RingoDingoDoo: hoe do they make their money back from the acquisition?
[2:29:10] wEiRdO_dUdE: Yeah I would think COD is more their style than WoW
[2:29:13] Mr_Neeo: you will get the free wow trial on game pass and like it chat LUL
[2:29:18] camekian: I‚Äôm happy that Spencer May give wow more time like they gave Halo
[2:29:18] Geri_0123: ESO sub is not included in the gamepass, doubt it wow would be in it
[2:29:19] jin_sensei: @Sollice yeah... we need to see
[2:29:20] Arcmourn: top 20 not top 10 i think
[2:29:21] Ravenward: So next it will be "World of Windows" ? RainbowPls

Microsoft already ran the numbers on every scenario with Bethesda and it determined exclusivity to Game Pass is the best way to drive its goals. It treats the money it loses from PlayStation sales as an investment/marketing cost to promote Game Pass.'' lets see if true

[3:15:02] MackAttack1421: not replace key developers
[3:15:03] r_kramerz: As a long time WoW player who quit about 6 months back due to the state of the game and my feelings about the business as a whole, I think this is a good thing for Blizzard games in the short term.  In the longer term, I think this continued consolidation is a bad thing for gaming overall.  You may like Phil Spencer (and I do), but one day he will be gone and Microsoft will still own the majority of gaming's big IP's.
[3:15:04] cahoots82: Can they really do any worse than Blizz's current devs? /s

[3:15:31] maccaruso: Ra-Den to be renamed Phil-Den
[3:15:32] Plague_GG: If anything they'll get a bigger budget to hire more employees

[3:16:02] xideontv: Ion updating his LinkedIn
[3:16:02] Hitmanblood: just by active players
[3:16:03] HaxzorJimDuggan: if you don't have to unsub you can redesign the game to have less daily requirements
[3:16:04] MILESkg21: 10-15
[3:16:04] kniftty: There is also no reason to think the game would just get lost in the mix. If anything it will have more money and potentially a larger team.

[3:27:52] Havoc_S1: Because eso for pc isn‚Äôt on game pass because it‚Äôs not on the Microsoft store
[3:28:00] ailoops: I can`t help but compare this to the streaming services. MS is putting as much as possible under gamepass, just like netflix Disney+ and so on

[3:28:13] thorined: @s1cKNation sorry but why would they split their audience between wow and that mmo it would just stupid
[3:28:13] unholyhoit: When a corporation gets sold the only people involved are shareholders, everyone else is standing on quicksand. The new board can do whatever they want.
[3:28:13] Lanthor: When you're trying to mythic raid and you hear one guy's mom tell him to pause the xbox for dinner
[3:28:14] TargetedMonk: xbox has more games than pc gamepass
[3:28:16] UnknownLegendDPS: same way eso plays on console KEKW @CrispyNugs
[3:28:17] After43ver: the whole board of ATVI is gona take the options and retire
[3:28:17] UltimaWeap: Will they put the WoW sub on Gamepass? Its pretty much the same price and it will probably drive in more WOW players
[3:28:19] CrispyNugs: @Xockel nowhere near the keybinds as WoW
[3:28:28] yshtola1337: so is microsfot gonna try and purchase nintendo next
[3:28:29] riversc17: @Towelliee shouldve been a streamer when i was younger because now i got the COVID

[3:28:34] ThaOriginalGamester: XB1 is last gen isn't it? We're Xbox Series X/S
[3:28:37] PoloDan: All of their first party titles are on both now
[3:28:38] Rudric_Ice: @91Niki Where does it say that ?
[3:28:39] Joneeeez: @UltimaWeap I hope it won't be more expensive for subbing to the game haha
[3:28:39] Aidler: XBox is a standardized PC nowadays
[3:28:40] dawgystyle_13: I'm going to get one so i can sit on my potato ass and farm and relax  :-)
[3:28:44] Demraxx: xbox is more for sittin on da couch
[3:28:51] mmo_kenna_: WoW could easy go on Xbox console
[3:28:51] V3_Ethereal: Xbox has moved pretty much all their titles to PC over this gen
[3:28:52] mojusk: and horse dewormer

[3:29:13] PokerFaceMoose: wow has a lot of buttons, gotta prune skills
[3:29:14] KoRnyRocks: i had covid, and i only had a headache, im not vaccinated i just take vitamins :)
[3:29:15] callmestray: Gamepass on PC is more limited than actual console game pass
[3:29:17] UltimaWeap: @Joneeeez I don't think so, they will just put it on gamepass that is a bit cheaper + you get a million other games on the side if your bored of wow for a moment
[3:29:18] giggz91: @Towelliee I think Micro buying activison is a great thing
[3:29:21] chavodk: you mean ps3?
[3:29:21] Margegowoot: ps3*
[3:29:22] cruzeal: danPanic

[3:29:23] Salfurium: same with the acquisition: don't panic
[3:29:25] Joneeeez: chill bois bobby got everything under control, no worries xD
[3:29:26] JDubln: xbox is about releasing on pc/xbox day and date for their library
[3:29:26] magiccanvashands: To give some perspective on the astonishing size of that figure, Disney paid $4.05 billion for Star Wars studio Lucasfilm in 2012, with half of the money paid in cash and the other half in Disney stock. A more interesting comparison is that Nintendo's net worth as of January 17th, 2022 is $59.39 billion.
[3:29:27] MILESkg21: i loved having 3 red ring of deaths LuL

[3:41:41] Necrosack: wow on gamepass? :D
[3:41:42] mrstittles: I imagine MS would focus more (far as the game lineup) on things like Overwatch vs WoW.   Making some overwatch things exclusive maybe and having more say in the esport aspect of it.

[3:47:23] mojusk: outlaw buffs? towel knows
[3:47:25] V3_Ethereal: They could alter the budget, which could influence the dev's decisions. outside of that it's still up to the devs.
[3:47:27] AmericanFat: @s1cKNation hots died because of their "mute" and "silence" system of toxic people, it was abused to hard by players without any punishment, that every good player eventually got banned.

[3:48:19] Murky_93: Yes
[3:48:21] Draz3nx: no but they can let the studio have it's autonomy to develop the games how they want
[3:48:21] CullenPrime: @Towelliee So I'm guessing you don't think WoW will be on Xbox.

[3:48:57] xhale2nhale: @mmrghost7 why would they remove something that makes alot of money
[3:48:58] Breakthecause: @Towelliee Microsoft treat their employees better. That's the best outcome of this whole thing
[3:49:00] starkos7: so you say nothing will change, then immediately backtrack and say the wow team could get bigger and given more time to make expansions
[3:49:00] Spekky: its already sub with a shop so free to play with a shop would be good
[3:49:05] Zerohz1: at most we will see some staff rotation with new assets but thats about it

[3:49:15] maddi_: @Towelliee ion's insistence to keep putting in month long daily grinds can be changed if the design philosophy is not centered on "we want players to spent tons of time" if they understand that that's what is killing the game, then it does affect wow
[3:49:15] Screamnsteam: employees like modCheck

[4:02:19] Calphurnious: wouldn't selling se dishonor their county
[4:02:21] mavericks312: xbox literally has no fanbase in asia SE selling to MS would make no sense
[4:02:23] Snabido: Oh no, you're switching to console wow because we say so Kappa

[4:02:53] maddi_: dude if they remove tokens that would be great for the game but it's staying
[4:02:55] Milanesa_De_Pollo: Why are people buying them? Scared they will go away?
[4:02:55] grokshar: they make too much money from it to remove it
[4:03:00] Squirrel_nutty: the token is too good a income

[4:03:19] Sonatta: Battle Net could REPLACE the windows store
[4:03:19] jacooners: i wonder if other members of the community will think this is good
[4:03:20] orasay1996: they're going to replace solitaire in windows 11 with the hearthstone LULW
[4:03:25] Jiraiya110: holy shit, activision blizzard stocks up by 20 USD just today
[4:03:25] KurumTV: I hope to god that the launcher sticks, I'd prefer not to use the Microsoft launcher, w/e it is called
[4:03:25] board4life65: add mircosoft name to it
[4:03:26] RalgorStreams: If the gold goes way up doesn‚Äôt that mean that the gold has lost value compared to the dollar?
[4:03:29] Velashen: Velashen subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 8 months! Microsoft Surface ads INC ;)
[4:03:29] Velladyn: B.net wont go anywhere because Blizzard's server infrastructure is industry leading
[4:03:29] KingSlayerYotam: imagine more games on bnet not just blizz
[4:03:30] QuigsTV: @Towelliee just put microsoft on the bnet launcher and keep it the same
[4:03:31] Kize_Gaming: ESO is on gamepass

[4:03:36] FusionKissMe: eso still has its launcher so why wouldnt wow
[4:03:38] thegummibearmassacre: Microsoft HandsUp
[4:03:39] DeejayKnight: If anything, the MS store should take the BNet launcher & make another variant of it for MS published games.
[4:03:39] LogiBare: @Towelliee Do you think wow will get ported to Xbox?
[4:03:40] Aidler: @towelliee Teams integration‚Ä¶lol
[4:03:41] dyslexican1: It will probably stay like this for a while. Eventually Im sure they will wrap it in.
[4:03:43] tebbix: I'm fine with battle net, I wish the could reduce the sub a little bit
[4:03:43] Rottencoarse: @Towelliee  ESO is ON GAMEPASS
[4:03:46] Havoc_S1: ESO pc
[4:03:48] Rottencoarse: b2p
[4:03:48] grokshar: yea you can play it
[4:03:50] Milanesa_De_Pollo: ESO is f2p
[4:03:50] Dianne____: to make the game good! *inhales copium*
[4:03:52] SeckSymbols: Im just gonna wait for Sony to buy Square Enix at this point and watch people flip after they celebrated Xbox buying Actiblizz
[4:03:53] at1c: isent ESO free to play?
[4:03:54] MILESkg21: it makes the gold worthless just like the USD LuL
[4:03:55] xo_navi: ESO is a lot different
[4:03:56] Maroleb: would the store items be earnable in game though?
[4:03:57] Holysal: @Rottencoarse only for console I thought
[4:04:00] FusionKissMe: yes eso is f2p
[4:04:01] DeejayKnight: The MS Store is missing the ease of use imo. Trying to update official Xbox games on PC is weird.
[4:04:03] Havoc_S1: ESO pc is not on pc game pass
[4:04:03] alex12645: we dont want the gold sellers to come back to wow
[4:04:06] FlameStryke: it will stay until they get everything done
[4:04:07] grokshar: ESO is not f2p wtf
[4:04:09] kungpufandah: ESO is on gamepass on console, I have it downloaded right now
[4:04:16] Burshu: I hope they find a different to monetize certain things. the sub money has hurt this game enough (timegating)
[4:04:16] Hyrva_: if they put wow on game pass they will also loss the box price money ,i dont think its worth
[4:04:18] muztho: yeah eso is on gamepass
[4:04:22] striker10000: nothing of that scale would change in under a year. maybe even 3 years
[4:04:24] fNandow: WoW buy 2 play now? LUL
[4:04:25] Densetsu_: @s1cKNation Starting up the competitive league again is what I'm talking about. Icefrog can't do that ^^

[4:04:33] Stanislav__k: üí∞ üêê üí∞ üêê üí∞ üêê üí∞ üêê
[4:04:34] Alegnowar: square enix is not worth a 1/10 of Activision stop being dumb
[4:04:35] KingsandClubs: Sony needs to buy EA and reforge sports game
[4:04:41] grokshar: @archiikz maybe on game pass but not in general
[4:04:46] Diet_Coke_Dude: Microsoft also owns Bethesda!  will we see a World of Warcraft / Skyrim  (The Elder Scrolls)  Crossover?
[4:04:47] charlescoka: who care about square enix LOOOOOOOL
[4:04:49] dyslexican1: I honestly want to see th token go away. I really think its bad for the games health overall. Sure its good for people selling runs. but its bad for the rest of us.
[4:04:50] Thoreya: WoW has been the goat. dont let that 2 month FF hype fool ya
[4:04:52] Aron3DP: Just keep WoW the same.
[4:04:54] cosmicD: @SeckSymbols the names are still absolutely huge
[4:04:55] mackieeswe: wow will stay the same
[4:04:55] layercake2004: this could be bad for wow.. They need to keep the 14.99 a month
[4:04:57] SeckSymbols: @Alegnowar Its not being dumb, Square is still a massive publisher in the gaming industry
[4:04:58] Hypertitan: i think not putting wow on gamepass would be a mistake
[4:05:01] LUKA_THIM: if tokens goes i cant play wow in my 3rd world country
[4:05:02] orasay1996: they're going to replace solitaire in windows 11 with the hearthstone LULW
[4:05:03] JiberishUI: Microsoft is going to let Blizzard run like their "old" selves
[4:05:04] xo_navi: oof nalak
[4:05:05] mavericks312: and the simple play would be to keep everything the same
[4:05:08] Spekky: they could do an mmo version of gamepass for a couple of bucks more including eso and wow sub
[4:05:14] Milanesa_De_Pollo: It will either stay the same, or Expansions will be included in Game Pass
[4:05:16] AmericanFat: NO WAY
[4:05:17] bawheid: billion $$ bobby is staying then?
[4:05:17] UnknownLegendDPS: omg KEKW @orasay1996
[4:05:19] Poriand: i think all of blizzards old games will go game pass
[4:05:19] luckfore: what about overwatch etc
[4:05:19] Aron3DP: They going changing things to WoW and players will riot.
[4:05:20] DChuster: ESO/WOW crossover
[4:05:23] SeckSymbols: @Jiberishxd Only while the ink dries where they dont have full autonomous control of Activision
[4:05:27] Shoebacca28: probs gamepass ultimate gets you wow or something
[4:05:27] Burshu: fuck the wow sub, it will make it so much better
[4:05:27] facerolljack: can I link a tweet with a microsoft meme? :D
[4:05:29] Nuclearthyme: Skyrim WoW expansion
[4:05:30] s1cKNation: @kingsandclubs they should better buy 2k Sports then KEKW

[4:05:35] ryptrs: Microsoft will let Blizzard make expansions like legion copium
[4:05:35] Crisis88: I think best case would be they add a new tier to game pass costing 15/month and it includes MMO subscriptions.
[4:05:37] Z3r0Fear: @Jiberishxd No way the company is going to have to produce money
[4:05:37] OceanManCarter: What if this acquisition goes into anti-trust negotiations and then as part of those negotiations, Blizzard gets spun out as its own independent company again with the rest of Activision/King going to Microsoft?
[4:05:37] firemedic005: @Towelliee  I hope wow comes to console because i can bearly sit in my chair.
[4:05:38] fat_european0: @Towelliee Do you think Blizzard will get more autonomy?
[4:05:40] Detonite: Playstation is BMW and xbox is more like a Ford :)
[4:05:44] satanic_viewer: but imagine how many people would get the gamepass if wow was in it
[4:05:46] MuttonChopins: Diablo 2 Resurrected on game pass
[4:05:49] Kize_Gaming: WoW makes a vast majority of their money from micro transactions though
[4:05:50] striker10000: time to archive the forums .. again LUL
[4:05:50] Merqury3: OW would be on gamepass I think
[4:05:52] MouthyNinja: @bawheid probly. even tho he's weird, he makes them billions. I think he aint goin anywhere
[4:05:55] MILESkg21: Detonite and they're both shit LuL
[4:05:56] mackieeswe: pay
[4:05:57] Arkenskjold: no, expansions costs
[4:05:59] Z3r0Fear: You still pay
[4:06:00] Howitzer1028: stll have to pay
[4:06:01] jaalexba: WoW sub lets you access all Blizz games Kappa
[4:06:04] Runnage13: same with ff14
[4:06:04] Rottencoarse: @Towelliee  you need to pay for the expansions
[4:06:05] Woodston: gotta pay for chapters
[4:06:07] wildwittra: The purchase is like buying a top-100 country based on its GDP
[4:06:09] Runnage13: I think
[4:06:10] darththanosyogert: @oceanmancarter That‚Äôs interesting
[4:06:12] cbiskit89: not enough time has passed to see if ESO model will really change
[4:06:13] SeanFromOhio: Still pay as of now
[4:06:15] JiberishUI: @SeckSymbols @Z3r0Fear letting blizzard operate like they USED to where they took TIME to produce GREAT games - that's what will make Microsoft more money
[4:06:15] layercake2004: if paying 14 99 a month put people off wow would have died already.. People are willing to pay it so keep it
[4:06:20] pilltillkill: @Runnage13 theyre talking ESO on gamepass, ffxi isnt on a similar platform
[4:06:25] LSBreed: Mike yabara with the smiley face tweet. he's gotta be happy
[4:06:29] HaxzorJimDuggan: maybe they include the sub but we still have to buy each expansion
[4:06:32] pilltillkill: @Runnage13 ffxiv*
[4:06:38] AmericanFat: What are you guys talking about, microsoft buying activision doesnt mean that activision gets closed... its the same company working with the same stuff, they just answer to Microsoft now, instead of Boby.
[4:06:39] Namtarts_TV: you get all of the DLC though with sub
[4:06:42] bawheid: @mouthyninja there is an ign article saying bobby is staying
[4:06:42] juggyyz: Same argument could be made for any game on game pass...why would microfost lose money on single purchase
[4:06:47] Z3r0Fear: @LSBreed I wonder if it was planned
[4:06:48] Namtarts_TV: which is 50% of the content
[4:06:51] MouthyNinja: @bawheid makes sense
[4:06:53] Hypertitan: i feel like having wow on gamepass is mutually beneficial to both gamepass and wow though.
[4:07:02] ryptrs: @Jiberishxd Agreed completely, but the same people who made shadowlands will make the next expansion, Microsoft won't change that
[4:07:04] fearkiller1234: is 10.0 coming with a new class?
[4:07:04] fNandow: microsoft owns sekiro now?
[4:07:05] Yrdehn: microsoft is mostly "hands off" with their studios
[4:07:14] HipHoptimusPrime: I bet the wow sub gets included with game pass
[4:07:18] RhadigarTV: Time for me to find an Xbox now
[4:07:20] Caboose05: New wow class dragonborn using power of the dragon
[4:07:22] Yrdehn: they let them do their thing
[4:07:24] cbiskit89: corporate culture does not move this fast. wouldn't expect any real changes for 5 years after close
[4:07:33] mavericks312: i also dont see CoD becoming xbox exclusive cause it makes a killing on PS. the dlc
[4:07:37] muztho: could be the end of wow
[4:07:38] riddledend: This is probably the best news for blizzard tbh
[4:07:39] SeckSymbols: I still think WoW will have its own subscription.
[4:07:39] mavericks312: are another story
[4:07:41] LordKain73: WoW not going to gamepass. Microsoft would lose tons of money from subscriptions.
[4:07:41] Sonatta: i wonder if Microsoft breaks ABK and have Activision, Blizzard, and King under the Microsoft umbrella instead of the ABK layer
[4:07:45] Howitzer1028: i think the sub goes to gamepass, expacs still paid for
[4:07:46] kashox: i think it to early but they are going to find a way to put wow into the xbox community in some way
[4:07:47] chet_the_man: paying monthly for wow is the worst way to do it lol if u dont buy 6 months at a time ur just throwing more money away
[4:07:47] HaxzorJimDuggan: there is plenty of WoW subs that dont have gamepass now im sure
[4:08:03] caedx: Sale won't even be finalized til a year from now.
[4:08:04] Franzeck: should i buy wow now? LUL
[4:08:06] Velnutz: Wow on Xbox when
[4:08:08] fearkiller1234: i bet the benfits are better at microsoft for the employees
[4:08:11] Howitzer1028: millions of people signing up for gamepass would be a huge win
[4:08:11] Happydays99: Agree with @cbiskit89. This is good news, but it will take YEARS for (hopefully) positive chage
[4:08:11] mavericks312: the deal could still possibly fall thru as well
[4:08:13] RhadigarTV: Yeah. We are all still scared shitless as employee's
[4:08:14] g_g_ashwood: came to hear toweliee
[4:08:15] JiberishUI: @ryptrs true. It was definitely rushed & lots of covid related things BUT yes you're right, the systems suck in shadowlands and that's due to the people making the game at blizz
[4:08:21] Hyrva_: yeah you never know , it could go south
[4:08:24] Qargory: there will be yeah
[4:08:27] tebbix: monkaS
[4:08:29] fat_european0: They should be scared with how bad they've been at developing the game
[4:08:32] fearkiller1234: it wouldnt be zoom
[4:08:33] Qeevdo: Ahem they would go over to Teams now :)
[4:08:35] Velladyn: They are not scared LOL, talking to one right now and they say they are all optimistic.
[4:08:36] cappei: Hopefully Steve Danuser gets shitcanned asap
[4:08:37] drmabusee: who will get all the money?
[4:08:37] ventu105: lol
[4:08:40] fearkiller1234: microsoft Teams calls lol
[4:08:42] NeoJon82: IT would be TEAMS calls.
[4:08:43] MILESkg21: TEAMS OMEGALUL
[4:08:43] Z3r0Fear: Microsoft Teams meetings
[4:08:43] GorSTL: soon to be Teams :D
[4:08:44] KiLLERJA0: @Towelliee what you think about bobby staying CEO of blizzard even though microsoft bought them
[4:08:45] mandarinetip: teams
[4:08:46] invisiblesock26: @Qeevdo KEKW
[4:08:46] ryptrs: @Jiberishxd Hoping right along with you buddy
[4:08:47] dillapuss: What I see is Microsoft not giving hard deadlines to certain developers so till games are ready to ship.
[4:08:48] Happydays99: Microsoft TEAMS!
[4:08:50] sgtalash: like the SpongeBob  when his brain goes nuts
[4:08:50] g_g_ashwood: no more zoom at blizzard
[4:08:51] SeckSymbols: Yeah, just because there is new leadership as a whole over Actiblizz, doesnt mean WoW gets fixed. Microsoft has never designed or operated an MMO on their own, outside of the recent ESO which isnt ANYWHERE near the level of what it takes to operate WoW

[4:09:42] Aron3DP: I've lost count of the amount of times it's been asked in chat about WoW coming to Xbox now lol

[4:22:31] Shoebacca28: @Lordkain73 its not f2p by being on the gamepass you still pay a sub for it. They will likely add a new tier to the game pass like the ultimate tier that gives you wow, be cheaper than a sub but still more income if you consider if people switch over from wow sub to gamepass + wow for more than 8.99 its profitable still.
[4:22:43] D0_ichibei: starcraft and age of empire now owned by the same company @towelliee

[4:22:50] pacificmc1: I bought Activision stock 5 days ago... Sell or hold HMM
[4:22:51] Biggs_o7: @LordKain73 if they include wow sub w/ game pass you get more people buying game pass which in turns makes more people play wow which makes more people buy ... you guessed it game pass. Thats all microsoft wants is you to buy game pass forever
[4:22:55] r2b2sw: maybe they can make a system that doesnt dashboard lol
[4:22:55] mavericks312: but no new fresh games of there doing
[4:22:56] tosenj: Age of empires was strong, they didn‚Äôt need to buy blizzard!

[4:23:04] SeckSymbols: @striker10000 Says the one who threw around terms first, child. Also, nice response to me proving you wrong. Are you going to continue to celebrate MS after I showed how they profit off of CCP forced labor?
[4:23:06] dranet11: @Towelliee sounds like you have alot of content
[4:23:06] Rooseweld: @pacificmc1 cod will still come they confirmed it

[4:23:17] fNandow: now microsoft can make a good Halo with cod and ow teams KEKW
[4:23:20] tosenj: Age of empires was massive! They didn‚Äôt need to buy this

[4:23:31] StuartUK94: what about Wow p servers tho :O
[4:23:32] Sollice: @droopydorf No way. WoW is a marque title. Everyone knows WoW. To turn it off would be stupid...Unless its WoW 2
[4:23:33] woolaio: @pacificmc1 hold, always
[4:23:35] Dcarter: i just dont like one company owning this much of the gamning market
[4:23:36] Sollice: Tencent gets paid out

[4:23:42] DarkenedHour97: they get bought out
[4:23:42] Sollice: Its a complete purchase
[4:23:43] LordKain73: @Shoebacca28 Hmm, I can see that happening. pay a little more money and include wow with the gamepass.
[4:23:43] Shoebacca28: not including the sales from games being bought outwith the game pass
[4:23:46] m3rk_zion: $95 sale on all shares. as far as I can find
[4:23:47] zpandoreonz: Better Microsoft than Tencent, if that happened Blizzard would become a mobile game company
[4:23:47] BubbaChubbs420: WoW is so big it is hard for people to even imagine
[4:23:48] Goodmourning20: Depends on the deal.
[4:23:48] maddi_: @Towelliee you don't need that % just a majority
[4:23:48] doobiesnacksi: they just get paid out
[4:23:49] im_n0t_jezus: buying them off probably
[4:23:50] Toon11: they sell all shares to microsoft at current price
[4:23:50] Maroleb: paid out it looks like
[4:23:50] Biggs_o7: tencent makes money because it gets converted to microsoft sotkc
[4:23:50] dawgystyle_13: stop taking the Blue pill and open your mind with the RED one.
[4:23:51] fearkiller1234: they buy their %
[4:23:52] neroforte77: @Sollice  yes EVERYONE knows WoW
[4:23:53] SeckSymbols: @Dcarter Thank you, there is ONE person in this chatroom that isnt up Microsofts ass
[4:23:56] tebbix: EZ cash

[4:23:58] Namtarts_TV: thats it
[4:23:59] peeves123: Shares transfer
[4:24:00] MackAttack1421: They can own both
[4:24:02] TheHoboWithAShotgun: what makes u think Microsoft actuslly gives 2 shits about Activision/blizzard?  they only care about thr moneybsnd maximizing profit and the quality will drop even more to satisfy the rich aholes who aren't absurdly rich enough.  just like
[4:24:03] Its_an_implication: Stock gets converted
[4:24:03] bc_23_: They‚Äôre bought out
[4:24:03] Sonatta: Tencent either gets paid out of a diluted amount of MS stock
[4:24:05] RoadDogg723: 25 million game pass subs right now
[4:24:07] Dcarter: i never think thats a good thing
[4:24:09] skyggen1177: you know that asset acquisituon meeting was like Microsoft telling Blizzard "Listen you are publicly hemmorhaging and your population and sales has been going downhill. Why don't you cut your losses and let us build you back up in your own image still."
[4:24:09] tosenj: Microsoft transaction money goes to tensen
[4:24:12] Namtarts_TV: thats what coprs do, they invest in one another and feed off one another
[4:24:14] Sollice: No this is a FULL purchase of cash none the less. Everyone is being PAID OUT
[4:24:15] Namtarts_TV: its a feedback loop
[4:24:16] eternalvic14: They are buying their shares as well I think
[4:24:18] TheHoboWithAShotgun: when Activision took blizz
[4:24:19] VegiXTV: theres a couple of ways it can work. they could get paid out or they could retain partial ownership and have their shares converted into microsoft shares
[4:24:24] 0dellil0: Mincrosoft is a risktaker, so they might imrpove the quality of blizz games
[4:24:24] DarkenedHour97: everyone that owned shares will get 95$ a share instead of 97 which is currenty
[4:24:25] Zavier420: @dcarter I feel the same
[4:24:26] kallidar: halo and warcrafot on mobile..mircosofts plan
[4:24:27] Layercake: LUL what
[4:24:28] MILESkg21: Monopoly is never a good thing
[4:24:29] CrispyNugs: You think Microsoft bought Blizzard for their 1 billion profit yearly? LOL it would take 60+ years to pay off
[4:24:30] anticensor_: kinda true

[4:24:40] Whonkers: @towelliee dont know if u've answered this yet but do you think microsoft will try to get old wow devs back?
[4:24:41] senseofpurpose90: I JUST WANT TO BUY A SURFACE WITH WOW GOLD
[4:24:42] Maroleb: that makes no sense
[4:24:44] tosenj: Microsoft only cares about how many skins you‚Äôll buy next quarter
[4:24:44] MrWeedoz: rich get richer
[4:24:45] TheHoboWithAShotgun: when Activision took and bought blizz
[4:24:46] neroforte77: @Towelliee is there apossibility that Tencent buys Microsoft?

[4:24:59] jettletv: bad to hold money during periods of large inflation
[4:25:02] luckfore: 70 BilLiOn Is NoT AlOt
[4:25:02] Shoebacca28: he said the opposite - they bought it to drive it into the ground to make a shit tonne of money lol
[4:25:04] CrispyNugs: Its just like how Bill Gates is buying up shit ton of land
[4:25:05] tosenj: Microsoft gonna drop 20 new skins by lunch time
[4:25:05] acturio01: xbox didnt even manage to do the monetization right for their flagship Halo
[4:25:06] issoebom: The only one that can change for the better is Microsoft

[4:25:17] Mazikeen69666: ty biggs
[4:25:20] LeideGaming: waiting on Elon Musk to buy Microsoft now Kappa
[4:25:21] tosenj: Nah they know the new expansion fire! That‚Äôs why they bought low now
[4:25:22] Synonymous: people scared wow will rebound and make the mmo they're playing die
[4:25:23] Halgrender: I dunno. Not a fan of MS. However i'm just inclined to say this was not a bad move.

[4:25:55] Diamantike: This puts allot of stake on Microsofts side here. And secretly I think their market share is to big and scary for the industry. But that is only my view on it.
[4:26:01] ProClicker: Game Pass will  eventually replace the WoW sub
[4:26:01] peeves123: I see it as positive
[4:26:01] tuttalama12: i read in mmo champ that they spent 70 000 000 000 just for candy crush cause blizzard games are dead LOL
[4:26:02] striker10000: @secksymbols please grow up. Tencent is owned by a highest status members if the CCP, friends of the dictator whom they helped by veto against actions when he was killing children in my country and killed my friends. Please start with honesty with yourself
[4:26:03] eternalvic14: This is a huge positive for the leadership especially

[4:26:10] acee_______: @secksymbols do you see it negatively
[4:26:10] PadidinJones: Im mostly curious. Microsoft has been ok since Steve Ballmer left
[4:26:11] Zanric2: Microsoft has done pretty good with its recent games, and game pass is awesome. This is most likely a positive.
[4:26:12] Rudric_Ice: Sony is prolly regretting now they didn't buy it instead
[4:26:13] Ribastur0075: what can we expect in terms of expansions. larger scale, better quality?
[4:26:14] cyb0rg_007: microsoft is like a hidden talent tree

[4:26:17] MackAttack1421: @Towelliee the Exec Team is 1/3 Female for Microsoft that will be incharge of Bliz/Act
[4:26:18] runiih: I'm a Microsoft hater for others reasons that are not  gaming, besides that nothing will be worse than what it is now
[4:26:19] Bogzeh: so will the activision name just go away?
[4:26:20] Pharaoh_326: is it true china still pays a per minute price to play wow?  in 2016 it was 30 yuan (about $4.40 USD) for 2700 minutes (45 hours).  @Towelliee
[4:26:21] Biggs_o7: Maybe we will finally get Starcraft III since they still love RTS
[4:26:23] BobLongMVP: @crispynugs ‚ÄúYou‚Äôll own nothing and be happy‚Äù
[4:26:23] Haikonlol: @towelliee  best news byebye bobby!

[4:26:29] azdrugr: All big gaming companies are complete trash tbh, but microsoft isnt the worst of them tbh
[4:26:29] dyslexican1: My only concern about the whole things is health of the industry over all. Any time a couple of companies own everything its bad for the health of an industry.
[4:26:35] TheHoboWithAShotgun: they maximize profit not caring about the quality of the product   just like Activision. CoD franchise is total ass and pure cash grab and takes advantage of people
[4:26:35] abiduel: playing wow with gamepass is gonna be crazy
[4:26:36] seanofthedeadistaken: I can't see either
[4:26:36] tosenj: Activision was so close to activist. The name change is clearly anti freedom!
[4:26:37] Halgrender: MS made Elder Scrolls Xbox exclusive. I hate them for doing that BibleThump
[4:26:38] Bogzeh: game pass is only available in like 10 countries
[4:26:38] BelllGoR: what recent games? all they have is forza or halo

[4:26:40] anticensor_: few years later oh nonono
[4:26:41] mandarinetip: fail venture boys downfall of wow
[4:26:41] Kelir: There is no indication that it will be positive yet. You only think that.
[4:26:41] tuttalama12: Diablo 4 DAY one on game pass
[4:26:41] acturio01: for gaming as a whole its not
[4:26:42] SeckSymbols: @acee_______ I see that consolidating the gaming industry and removing long established franchises from exist platforms as a negative, yes.
[4:26:45] CrispyNugs: @tacobellfan420  fax
[4:26:45] AveragePvp: @abdarahyin facts

[4:26:48] MILESkg21: wall of text crit me for over 9000
[4:26:49] ryptrs: There's no possible way Microsoft could torpedo WoW further, this can only be a positive
[4:26:50] tosenj: Activision was so close to activist. The name change is clearly anti freedom! And so are you!
[4:26:51] Grunton: game pass goes on sale for 1 every few months
[4:26:53] TodaysTheDayEh: Essay Andy‚Äôs need a blog squadLaugh

[4:27:05] HaloS23: @Towelliee you think Microsoft will come in with day 1 changes? not just WoW i mean
[4:27:06] Sonatta: EA is probably next
[4:27:08] BubbaChubbs420: that would be sick if we get game pass now
[4:27:09] eternalvic14: Sony fan boys pls cut that microsoft hate
[4:27:09] boxxxxxxxxxxx: Is Microsoft going to attempt to monetize all platforms with the monetization laws?
[4:27:13] striker10000: Wow... biggots are VIPs on this stream.. nice
[4:27:13] S1appadabass: @Towelliee is Disney can get away with their bullshit, so can Microsoft
[4:27:14] tosenj: Monopolize the masses!
[4:27:14] acturio01: being inevitable is still worring for gaming

[4:27:42] neroforte77: hmmm i should buy microsoft stocks
[4:27:42] Dinosew: I hate hearing the name activision blizzard
[4:27:44] SeckSymbols: And I'd be shitting on Sony buying Activision all the same, its not about platforms, its about consolidation and how its unhealthy.
[4:27:44] Sollice: @striker10000 Who are you talking about?
[4:27:45] KingsandClubs: Yeah sony‚Äôs next move should be EA and reforging the entite sports gaming industry
[4:27:46] tosenj: Activision was so close to activist. The name change is clearly anti freedom!
[4:27:49] abdarahyin: Sony somehow isn't a megacorporation that loves money. I just don't get that.
[4:27:50] dyslexican1: Im not saying that im not happy to see the company sold. Im just making a comment on the gaming industry as a whole. i don;t want to see 2-3 publishers owning everything.
[4:27:51] siliconwafer: Change will be minimal and take years.  Expect more xbox titles.
[4:27:53] striker10000: @secksymbols grow up
[4:27:56] r0b928: I don‚Äôt see how this is a bad thing at all. Except for the possibility of lay offs.
[4:27:57] fancyjoe: not sony!, MS makes sure their games works on PC and Console!
[4:27:59] davrosdk: I'm going to assume MS will move the WoW/Blizzard servers to Azure
[4:28:00] RelaxDecaf: itll be a easy anti trust win for Microsoft. Still too many players in the market no matter how you cut it
[4:28:03] eternalvic14: Sony would be worse at least Microsoft has Xbox pc pass
[4:28:03] Detonite: When I think about microsoft cant help thinking about Bill Gates cringy interview about Epstein :S
[4:28:05] LeideGaming: imagine buying Activision Blizzard using the WoW Tokens Kappa
[4:28:09] Vivelli: YEP
[4:28:09] Halgrender: I agree that Activision is crap. That's why i'm inclined to say that this was a good move. Even tho i don't like MS at all.
[4:28:10] UlsterFarl: Should have been Paradox then WOW could become the first Grand Strategy MMO

[4:41:32] TheHoboWithAShotgun: new world still lacks end game. the PvP is boring.  owning territories means like nothing tbh not worth the effort which was supposed to be the biggest seller for it.  no real point grinding for best level gear cause theirs virtually jack shit to do with it.   its good to level to 60 but once u get there it'd boring as fuck.  this mutators stuff adding a little cool but then again if u do thr harder difficulties snd get the gear what u gonna do with it?

[5:16:56] im_n0t_jezus: about to do ICC for invincible 6 tries wish luck

[5:17:15] xXSiebzehnXx: I like him, I feel bad he has to eat all the shit
[5:17:15] EmpathyLiveChat: @Rulem To me Ion comes across as a bit slimey
[5:17:18] Khade_Tyrson: Hopefully they fix the lag issues!

[5:17:51] randomspikes: diablo mobile lololol
[5:17:55] TheGaoSora: oh
[5:17:57] Sollice: @Rulem I mean thats fair. I don't think Ion does a good job of communicating his position which is odd with his former position
[5:18:02] BullDevil: lol, looks like Max just woke up and found out. Twitter today is fun
[5:18:05] FlZZlX: time for wow 2

[5:18:43] flebbooo: One thing microsoft has suffered from the past decade is having a wide range of IPs, well now they got it
[5:18:44] randomspikes: I am a gaming industry goat, actually 10 year vet in mobile gaming marketing. suffering in comparable poorness lolololol 67 billion dollar makes you think
[5:18:44] reffan: they will make sure they make the most of the purchase, what that means for consumers and deveopers is anybodys guess at this point

[5:19:40] XvatisTheHunter: Maybe they gonna put more money in championships since its not gonna be a problem and give more players chances to be in that part of pro players
[5:19:44] dugarg_: @unholyagony I just tuned in, and saw the news on internet
[5:19:50] Sollice: That he already knows
[5:19:54] 3v3r35t_: <Microsoft Limit>
[5:19:57] unholyagony: @dugarg_ EA would ruin everything
[5:19:58] Rulem: I guess; I don't control shit.  I would prefer it be held in a more controlled environment.  I think it would be more fun to watch
[5:19:58] Sollice: But he secret secret
[5:20:02] TheGaoSora: I mean Max and Co wants a PTR like realm that lets them to be geared for the race from patch day one, that'll require company involvement ü§∑
[5:20:04] Draugrs: Question is will Microsoft spend the resources. They half went into the phone market but did not dedicate the proper resources to make it.
[5:20:16] Triggeryy: You see Holinka's tweet?
[5:20:18] MrGrimms: Lore was floored from the news or drinking..... :D

[5:20:35] gewtv: Of course ppl in Blizz didn‚Äôt know that would be insider trading
[5:20:39] flebbooo: big true
[5:20:41] Eraste: 9.1 was the best race to world first Kappa
[5:20:48] ExigentMidnight: Offering a prize for world first would open up a huge legal can of worms. All of the hotfixes, server outages, and balance changes could become legally actionable
[5:20:48] Halgrender: It's very complex to come up with fair rules for RWF.
[5:20:51] Heero_Effect: MLG-MAX ;)
[5:20:57] HaxzorJimDuggan: also doing sponsored RWF on the public servers like how could is possibly be fair when you got people helping from outside the raid group
[5:20:58] Epiclurker27893: Once a big company takes over an event the rules and expectations change. Companies that didn't pay attention before will become sue happy once they see someone who big money involved.

[5:21:01] Toon11: its the time of Master war chief of the horde

[5:21:14] MILESkg21: just release it at the same time Kappa
[5:21:15] Sollice: That would be one change they would have to institute
[5:21:16] neo_0098: for how much did Microsoft buy ABK?
[5:21:17] Rulem: @ExigentMidnight they already handle it for M+ just fine
[5:21:27] TheGaoSora: of course not, which makes their demands for day 1 2nd leggo and less rng grind kinda weird
[5:21:38] Collected1: you could easily lock the mythic instance to only certain guilds
[5:21:41] xXSiebzehnXx: I think a draft would be good for MDI style, blocking people out of character combinations and stuff

[5:22:00] Krasis: I actually wouldn't watch
[5:22:02] Sollice: MDI and Arena is not a new thing RWF is always new
[5:22:02] Billserk: I can't wait until the next WoW expansion where we summon a portal to the Halo Ring and fight off the Covanent with Master Chief and the new WoW class the Spartan.
[5:22:03] assman_ny: Not a chance
[5:22:03] pacificmc1: no its boring i dont care about RWF

[5:33:02] officialviz: @Sollice I believe there was a post saying he would be gone once the deal is fully done, but of course he must go.
[5:33:03] Sollice: Studio synergy you hope as well
[5:33:03] Orion280: oooh better QA
[5:33:10] SilkeySmooth: they will allocate the new sub fee you will be paying its going up
[5:33:11] Noobicron: we need danny mcbride as the new CEO
[5:33:12] MagicMalTv: our sub will only be $9.99 as well
[5:33:12] FergusCreative: Yup, maybe smaller studios will collab more when not working on huge projects
[5:33:12] neo_0098: but why does the purchase take 18 Months?
[5:33:13] Rudric_Ice: Hiring more people for other blizzard games
[5:33:15] pacificmc1: The best part is not the resources. It's the fact that Bobby Kotick is gone in 1.5 years
[5:33:15] KingsandClubs: It‚Äôs simple sony said fuck you xbox we have exclusives and xbox answered with yeah fuck you we got money
[5:33:18] Sollice: @xXSiebzehnXx Your 100% correct. This was ABSOLUTELY negotiated as part of the deal

[5:33:44] dugarg_: fucking Bobby and his 40mil salary lol
[5:33:45] oxidexd: anti trust
[5:33:45] Geesmiley: so Microsoft is the parent company now for Blizzard?
[5:33:46] Noobicron: maybe they hire a PVP team
[5:33:47] Sollice: Someone said earlier Activision Fiscal ended in June? So that would make sense. 2022 is not a responsible time frame
[5:33:50] lovemymage: there could be anti-trust issue too
[5:33:51] michaelmm: It needs anti trust approval. Government works at a snails pace!

[5:33:54] Nerendis: 18 months is fucking fast, waht are people talking about
[5:33:56] SilkeySmooth: @MagicMalTv more like the cost of game pass is what you will be paying your sub is going to be going up
[5:33:56] Hangalik: is it reversible at this point?
[5:33:58] mavericks312: the deal still has to pass the courts
[5:34:00] xXSiebzehnXx: They have to pay off existing debts and it all has to go through court
[5:34:02] elfenaka: official end is at the year mark. The companies will start internally working together in June after its been approved.
[5:34:04] Bayne77: big business purchases like this and for that amount of money ALWAYS takes months and months
[5:34:05] pacificmc1: Microsoft be like "Fine, we'll fix it ourself!"
[5:34:08] thiccsushi: I don't think it will change much but I hope my pessimism is proven wrong a patch or two in next expansion
[5:34:10] Sincline387: FTC regs as well, because of the size it'll need approval to insure they are not creating a monoply/trust
[5:34:13] Halgrender: @t_train_va WoW is considered legacy. Really hard to move to the cloud.
[5:34:13] Sollice: They did reconsider. They reconsidered and decided to buy those fuckers

[5:54:46] MILESkg21: WHAT 4Head
[5:54:48] Atolanos: We def have a new class coming in 10.0 because wow really needs it
[5:54:49] Thoreya: dummies lol
[5:54:55] PaWseN9: well i mean you need people invested in the game, in order to make money off the game. So some new direction would be good for the game tbf
[5:54:56] MILESkg21: MATH IS HARD KEKW
[5:54:58] Wildside1177: 188.qtr
[5:55:04] fewyn: MATH IS HARD CHAT
[5:55:06] zinbers: oh ok
[5:55:06] Thoreya: wow just had its most successful quarter in like 10 years financially
[5:55:08] ventu105: what server you play WoW @Towelliee ?
[5:55:08] CrusaderNero: 2+2 = 4 quick math
[5:55:08] Wildside1177: 188//qtr
[5:55:12] ShadowPoet: It is hard
[5:55:13] Archiee: quick mafs
[5:55:13] zinbers: i did not know

[5:55:16] duhworks: they make that a month
[5:55:22] lushu_2077: if they made that the game would shut down
[5:55:26] Sollice: Store mounts FTW
[5:55:26] Calphurnious: @Atolanos I'd love that but they need to get the specs we have now right too
[5:55:28] GamerGeek21: COD is activision big money maker, NOT WOW...
[5:55:29] pilltillkill: @duhworks they make it a quarter
[5:55:32] spainard15: Token and Charcter transfers
[5:55:39] onous_: Damn Towelliee you got your FF community triggered.
[5:55:50] pilltillkill: @therealonous did anyone even mention FF? lol
[5:55:54] j_bar111: @Towelliee do you think with MS they will do more for RWF
[5:55:57] realcousineddie: microsoft wont do shit with WOW, it will continue to run as it goes, because it still generates cash.  the purchase was for candy crush and COD (to make exclusive).  King is 3 times the revenue of blizz and the future is mobile.  Slow the hype on anything wow related.
[5:55:58] Atolanos: @Atolanos Well thats just a given in 10.0 the specs will likely be overhauled as per usual with an xpac
[5:56:00] Empyrialist: Raw, probably - but after costs, licenses, fees, advertising etc... I wouldn't be surprised if that number shrinks dramatically.
[5:56:02] Sollice: CandyCrush is Activision big money maker
[5:56:05] xXSiebzehnXx: @sollice WHAT IF the resources they datamined for that mount is for the store LUL
[5:56:06] Archiee: COD is garbage
[5:56:09] Herzenliegen: @Attackroot They don't have to change it but if they wanted, they could.
[5:56:10] mrstittles: I wouldn't expect much in the way of changes to day to day operations. What we can hope for is good content creation going forwards with MS's larger pool of resources.
[5:56:12] Rudric_Ice: At the end of the day Microsoft is money hungry company too
[5:56:13] pacificmc1: @Empyrialist do you know what the word PROFIT means
[5:56:19] akaari5486: is wow community crying and complaining for microsoft now ?
[5:56:22] Noobicron: yeah cod is pretty bad right now
[5:56:22] MagicMalTv: ya candy crush is the biggest for sure
[5:56:25] Sollice: @xXSiebzehnXx Well they said the store mounts normally predict the expansion type
[5:56:27] mmo_kenna_: Microsoft doesn't like loot boxes, ESO had to make changes when it was acquired
[5:56:30] MagicMalTv: all these moms at home spending thousands a month.
[5:56:32] 91Niki: @Sollice It's all the facebook boomers making them money on that LUL
[5:56:35] raldrik: So is this summer project 60 waiting on 9.2 or going to wait for the 9.2 to 10.0 drought
[5:56:35] onous_: @pilltillkill nah, but the reactions you didnt need to. The hate runs deep and you can tell.
[5:56:37] DragonofWolves: YoshiP ain't worried about all this. if anything he'll see it as a good thing
[5:56:42] ZabberzTV: they can promote it all they want but stay away

[5:57:12] swordart_19: SO many Clueless people in chat is Ridiculous
[5:57:14] pacificmc1: @Empyrialist store mounts and wow tokens = big stonks :P
[5:57:19] Sollice: @xXSiebzehnXx No I am saying your right. It will be a store mount and that predicts the expansion type
[5:57:20] 91Niki: @Sollice I've heard you start making angry comments on facebook posts after an hour of playing
[5:57:27] GroovyBryan: They would lose money if they mad cod an exclusive.
[5:57:37] Sollice: @91Niki I am sure Katie would love that. I am 40 now I am allowed to be an angry old man
[5:57:41] rektardin69: Check Candycrush PEPW
[5:57:48] houseofficer1: imagine thinking cod value is worth much compared to Microsoft spreadsheet

[5:58:02] Lumality: I still cry once a week or so at what they did to Heroes of the Storm :/
[5:58:04] Sollice: @xXSiebzehnXx I have no sense of humor
[5:58:07] swordart_19: COD Is Pog
[5:58:08] MagicMalTv: yes mobile games are the money grabbers people.
[5:58:09] swordart_19: :P
[5:58:10] mmo_kenna_: COD Mobile is a good game
[5:58:11] Kleavage: Casuals just buy the new COD
[5:58:16] th9o: You think Microsoft will make COD an Xbox exclusive?
[5:58:20] Sollice: Listen I played farmville when that shit came out like 27 years ago

[5:58:39] Kinghorn: towelliee the whale üêã
[5:58:40] CrusaderNero: @warrenny not good tbh
[5:58:48] onous_: So would you move COD to a pc and xbox exclusives or keep that line with PS open?
[5:58:49] Noobicron: vanguard is bad, went back to apex lol
[5:58:50] ScratchSpy: I think the long-term vision is to continue to add value to their GamePass so they attract more subscribers while slowly increasing price (i.e., Netflix model). I think it's very plausible WoW gets added to some tier of the Game Pass.
[5:58:52] ZabberzTV: oh god vanguard is shit compared
[5:58:55] Sollice: @warrenny Vanguard is getting high praise....everyone loves it...sure

[6:07:47] Bayne77: scrooge mcduck that shit
[6:07:47] mrstittles: It may not be a big deal anyways. Microsoft may just take blizz stock and give out partial shares bases on  MS stock price.
[6:07:55] mrstittles: *based
[6:08:01] realcousineddie: this is far from reality at this point, as the stock is trading at $82, indicating that the market isn't sure this will happen.  With the libs on capital hill and biden and they're push for antitrust, a lot needs to happen for this to go down, at least as a whole package..many options, like selling off parts of the business first.
[6:08:02] Sollice: @mrstittles It's an all cash deal

[6:13:01] realcousineddie: ideally, during the review at the FTC, its agreed they will spin off Blizzard, as MCSFT doesn't want those legal/toxic issues, they bought on a bargain for COD and King..they may spin Blizz off and the same can be accomplished.  Wishful thinking, but still a viable option.

[6:38:17] Rastailian: Next WoW expansion will be the tenth.  WoW: X.... WoW X-Box?
[6:38:18] mavericks312: please lord spencer buff frost mage
[6:38:19] Bayne77: idk man, i heard bill gates plays a demo warlock and theres quietly going to be buffs to the spec...
[6:38:20] Sonatta: Arcane Mage ijpNODDERS
[6:38:23] mrstittles: Microsoft gonna be like "Is this profitable? Cool." Unless they can make substantially more money off it, don't expect a huge change lol
[6:38:34] itsTwigs_: those half expansions are coming
[6:38:34] dawgystyle_13: BUT, can i read my Hotmail ingame at a mailbox in SW?
[6:38:35] mattybenchpress: the only thing changing is one company name, game still exists in exactly the same state
[6:38:37] Ordicos: microsoft buys blizzard just to delete gnomes from the game
[6:38:40] neo_0098: Phil Spencer plays wow?????????
[6:38:44] YellNmyBut: !RWF
[6:38:44] Moobot: @YellNmyBut Who wins? https://strawpoll.com/cz3q7xfco
[6:38:47] falldrgn: BUT it could tho.. the aquistion, could cause a member of the class team to quit, thus reducing the set of eyes on the data, and something could be missed and mages will still get nerfed
[6:38:48] Kisswani: @after_xxx yoooo , that would be great
[6:39:01] FrozenlandPT: Q1 2023 seems firm
[6:39:01] mrstittles: Good time to purchase anyways if we're due for an expansion in the next 18-24mo
[6:39:02] Shuttlelol: is there a post somewhere about the 10.0 in 2023 with the lore reset?
[6:39:02] Holy_Z: with 9.2 being last patch already
[6:39:03] Sollice: I hope Microsoft's simple message to Blizzard is ok....you take the reigns again and make a product you want to produce. Everyone will come back to them
[6:39:07] Holy_Z: no way
[6:39:11] Tharia: lol
[6:39:12] MILESkg21: 10.0 is CATA 2 Kappa
[6:39:13] Kisswani: KEKW
[6:39:16] s_t_o_r_m__: hahah LUL
[6:39:17] Kisswani: towTinfoil
[6:39:21] pronkk_: mages? nerfed? that doesnt make sense
[6:39:22] lekkahdh: 0___0 that's a long stretch
[6:39:25] CCG_337: phill Spencer plays a ret paladin in clasic
[6:39:26] opinionatedfairy6669: Is all of blizzard Microsoft's now ? or just a division/part of bliz ?
[6:39:32] magiccanvashands: @Sollice AHAHAHAHAHA yeah right
[6:39:35] Nidtog: wow metaverse = moon
[6:39:38] warrenny: @sollice Activision had nothing to do with woe development

[6:39:44] falldrgn: new class inc..spartan...
[6:39:45] reverbsoul1: @nosk6669 All of ATVI, Blizz, Acti, and King
[6:39:46] r0b928: I feel like I r been hearing about these WoW mobile games for three years. When are they coming out???
[6:39:47] mmo_kenna_: The wow Devs are probs hyped at this news
[6:39:50] nocturnal_2195: the question is for me when will WoTLK
[6:39:57] nocturnal_2195: come out
[6:40:02] Sollice: @warrenny If you don't think Activision had anything to do with them pushing products, cutting staff are nuts
[6:40:08] warrenny: @nosk6669 Everything activisionblizz related
[6:40:08] MILESkg21: we've ran out of ideas
[6:40:10] MARTZiiE: How do you think Microsoft buying blizzard will affect the future of the game ?
[6:40:17] Kittastrophe: huffing on the copium way too hard guys
[6:40:18] Moobot: towHAMUP Follow Towelliee on twitter so you can be in the know at all times! | twitter.com/towelthetank towKawaii
[6:40:18] DatSheppy: I don't trust any corporation to not fuck up WoW :)
[6:40:19] a__a__ron__: @towelliee If WoW comes to Xbox, how exactly would you even perform a rotation with a controller?! Lol
[6:40:23] realsylos: Let's Hope Microsoft will sweep the Management off all the bad apples
[6:40:29] Sylhepnia: Hey Towelliee! What do you think what will happen to the money on Battle net balance?
[6:40:36] endobleedz: they better do there job to keep there job
[6:40:37] Shuttlelol: @a_a_ron_95 same way people do on FFXIV on PS5
[6:40:37] m1NAYgg: i hope thats in the deal
[6:40:42] orbiitz269: @a_a_ron_95 the same way FFXIV does
[6:40:47] BoiAtomico: them mofos think MS buying Blizzard means we get space mcfart out of the blue in the game and shit
[6:40:48] mmo_kenna_: WoW please great on controller
[6:40:49] Kisswani: it has to be somewhat concerning
[6:41:09] Cole88: i highly doubt battlenet will be gone
[6:41:09] BoiAtomico: Chill out holmes, it's still WoW. No Misterchief on this train
[6:41:09] warrenny: @sollice The only proof there is of activision ruining wow is players bitching which i don‚Äôt take anywhere serious
[6:41:16] Holy_Z: I can buy a surface with wow tokens! PogChamp Kappa
[6:41:21] endobleedz: shit i have to give bill gates more money
[6:41:22] XBazenTus: @mmo_kenna_ and VR maybe ^^

[6:41:35] xXSiebzehnXx: towRekt
[6:41:39] CCG_337: new blood
[6:41:41] Shuttlelol: id be nervous if i were management at blizzard LULW
[6:41:44] Cole88: i think overall this should be good
[6:41:47] reverbsoul1: It should be concerning for those that work on things that already exist. Devs should be safe, they work on a specific product. Customer support should worry because MS will already have a large and trained CS team.
[6:41:49] Devil301: new blood in the dev teams might be a good thing. stagnation is a real thing
[6:41:50] anekdotin: Happy time activision was dieing and taking wow with it
[6:41:51] Kittastrophe: Maybe Overwatch2 will finally happen.
[6:41:52] realsylos: @TheAtomicRam No but I think Microsoft will not tolerate the bullshit ATVI is pulling atm. Usually when a Company gets bought it is because the Buyer thinks they are not as good as they could be.
[6:41:59] m1NAYgg: Blizzoft?
[6:41:59] zpandoreonz: So master chief will defeat Zovaal in 9.2 huh ?
[6:42:03] MILESkg21: https://twitter.com/PlatinumWoW654/status/1483477343096111107 OMFG KEKW
[6:42:04] CCG_337: no Blix con this year right?
[6:42:05] allencoded: i miss blizzcon
[6:42:10] KingofMeccano: @Towelliee have you seen the CNBC interview with bobby and Phil on WoWhead
[6:42:11] Abaquar: Mc Blizzard KKona
[6:42:11] DatSheppy: Microsoft will be the same dogshit as activision
[6:42:12] Aerisot: Do you think they canceled Blizzcon becasuse they knew this transaction was coming?
[6:42:12] Shuttlelol: i wonder if microsoft will have a mega convention, id attend to see all their games
[6:42:13] strchsr: @Towelliee I like how Blizzard is coming full circle and being owned by a Pacific Northwest company again
[6:42:14] rhonins: if they do theyr job properly they should'n be scared
[6:42:15] Sp3ckooooo: you think LUL
[6:42:17] zarsz95: I think it's more likely to be Microsoft-Activision right?
[6:42:20] CCG_337: no Blizzcon this year right?
[6:42:21] Horuseternal69: microblizz :)
[6:42:22] Cole88: I mean think about it. Microsoft lets Minecraft have their own things just apply that to blizzard @Towelliee
[6:42:22] m1NAYgg: BlizzoftCon LUL
[6:42:22] michaelmm: MS are big on conventions.
[6:42:26] Milanesa_De_Pollo: When is new PTR build?
[6:42:27] BoiAtomico: @realsylos Yeah, but we all can agree that ATVI is good to go when it comes to WoW rofl
[6:42:28] MoChuLu: Towlie! You rock dude!
[6:42:28] Staksor: Idk, I could see them do announcements at E3 for ActiBlizz games
[6:42:37] Technogre: nothing changed on ESO when msft bought Bethesda
[6:42:40] TheCliffyShow: New WoW store weapon transmog, chainsaw gun.
[6:42:50] mrstittles: mrstittles subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 5 months, currently on a 1 month streak! 
[6:42:51] MILESkg21: business as usual
[6:42:52] Clay2K_: @Towelliee didn't you already do tormenters on this char? I thought you can't get loot twice or are you doing for achieve?
[6:42:59] Herzenliegen: Sounds good to me
[6:43:00] PancakesOnMyFace: wouldnt make sense for microsoft to get rid of blizzcon, they make to much money from it
[6:43:01] viraal2784: maybe ms can providee some resources to help with dev.
[6:43:01] DatSheppy: Then they make us buy a fuckin game pass LUL
[6:43:04] Sollice: @warrenny I dont think Activision ruined the game. The quality has declined and that's Blizzards fault.
[6:43:04] CCG_337: more transmog and mounts
[6:43:10] endobleedz: wow comes free with windows 12
[6:43:11] WundertueteGER: sadge
[6:43:13] BoiAtomico: Hell, I'll consider paying 15,99‚Ç¨ if it gives me access to gamepass Towelliee
[6:43:15] Hifonik: !RWF
[6:43:16] Moobot: @Hifonik Who wins? https://strawpoll.com/cz3q7xfco
[6:43:21] mavericks312: and wow will still be a reported dead game lol
[6:43:23] zarsz95: I would love if they made gamepass ultimate include a wow sub
[6:43:30] Shuttlelol: hopefully better management
[6:43:32] gimmlay: master chief beating the jailer confirmed
[6:43:32] realsylos: @TheAtomicRam If you mean good to close down WoW because its a dumpsterfire yeah. But Management decisions brought the downfall. And they could very well bring a good turn
[6:43:34] anekdotin: activision ruined wow glad they gone
[6:43:36] NickLeonhearth: @Towelliee I can see the expansion going to game pass, and ppl then paying 15$ a month
[6:43:38] r0b928: At least for the foreseeable future. I could see them tweaking it in a few years.
[6:43:40] neo_0098: @clay2k_ weekly reset
[6:43:42] warrenny: @sollice ok
[6:43:48] s_t_o_r_m__: gaming meta-verse shift basically
[6:43:48] Bayne77: wow has been ded since 1997 Kappa
[6:43:49] smygel: hm
[6:43:50] DatSheppy: @zarsz95 i literally have no desire to buy a gamepass
[6:43:58] r0b928: When are these mobile games coming out? I feel like I‚Äôve been hearing about them for 3 years now.

[6:43:59] Holy_Z: @anekdotin they arent gone lol just not top dog
[6:44:00] Sollice: I think JAB was god awful for Blizzard. Not sure if that is his fault or someone elses but that was not a good appointing
[6:44:04] Kisswani: I would love if their first order of business is a huge influx of QA personnel
[6:44:06] Masamuneee: maybe some of the eso team will go to blizz and vv
[6:44:09] N3llee: isnt e3 dead convention now?
[6:44:12] piratechris: Still a lot of players playing this "dead game" on my server... LUL
[6:44:13] Holysal: @anekdotin activation and blizzard the the same company lol

[6:44:27] zarsz95: @DatSheppy It would be cool if there was a wow only sub option, but for those with gamepass already it would be great without having to pay 2 subs
[6:44:28] flebbooo: Bobby clip on wowhead
[6:44:29] haugexxx: halo MMO?
[6:44:31] CrusaderNero: World Of Warcraft: Office

[6:44:41] Aidler: they will call it E4 then
[6:44:44] pronkk_: @emosnotdeadd um?
[6:44:44] zarsz95: @DatSheppy but I feel you not wanting to get gamepass if it doesn't interest you at all
[6:44:46] BoiAtomico: @realsylos I meant good to go as in good to gtfo LUL too much monetization. Not that Blizzard is free of fault, their own decisions are being mad as fuck lately, I'd personally kick Ion out of lead game dev, either out of the game completely or back to raid design has he was before
[6:44:47] xXSiebzehnXx: PHIIILLLLLL
[6:44:48] falldrgn: They can't let this xpac go on for a year.. They are gonna.. but still an annoucement or something needs to happen Im thinking gamescom
[6:44:49] SirVoro: Sup Ya'll
[6:44:50] Hazeness: Do you think Microsoft would look to bring anyone back into the fold of Blizzard side like a Jeff Kaplan, who left due to company differences?
[6:44:51] MR_WYTE: Micrizzcon 2023 Kappa
[6:44:52] Kittastrophe: Microsoft Smash Brothers confirmed to finally take on the Nintendo powerhouse.

[6:45:08] jxxpn: Perhaps nothing changes for awhile, then they release WoW 2.. in 4 years...
[6:45:12] Autoexeq: New class for 10.0 Spreadsheeter
[6:45:14] realsylos: @TheAtomicRam agreed
[6:45:15] Bayne77: microsoft office will be integrated into wow so that min/maxers can create their own custom spreadsheets
[6:45:16] Kisswani: is this the largest gaming merger ever ?

[6:45:50] Sollice: In less than one year MS bought Bethesda and Activision lol
[6:45:51] Aidler: @bayne77 Team will get a WoW integration
[6:45:51] Rastailian: Clippy battle pet: when?
[6:45:51] firemedic005: better than tencent buying them.
[6:45:52] Rowwek: maybe we'll get Warcraft 4 finally

[6:46:03] jxxpn: Imho, the stock price will go down since Blizzard lost value with the sale.
[6:46:05] fewyn: KEKW
[6:46:08] Shalamyne: @Towelliee wowhead post on the deal
[6:46:10] MILESkg21: would we lie KEKW
[6:46:10] DevilSpire: How much did they buy them for?
[6:46:12] Aervyper: @Towelliee does this mean 100% that wow is coming to the xbox?
[6:46:15] lucidiamonds420: Random announcement... my dog seemed to think that tea bagging my phone is a thing that needed to happen...
[6:46:16] CCG_337: I was here,  and yet I have the same money...
[6:46:18] realsylos: Microsoft actually already said the ATVI Games are gonna be on Gamepass. I would think WoW could very well be part of it. And since they seem to try to be the Netflix of Gaming, I'd say the chances are pretty high
[6:46:24] sgtalash: clip
[6:46:32] Holysal: @Aervyper no
[6:46:37] Kisswani: @realsylos is that true ? in the interview ?
[6:46:37] Technogre: @devilspire 69 billion
[6:46:39] volkreig: Towellie, what about wow in the metaverse, doesnt that sound odd?
[6:46:39] Bayne77: towHAMUP DeGenSquad towHAMUP
[6:46:44] xghostyyx: @Towelliee I just nailed my interview bout to start 2022 off with a new house and job!
[6:46:45] Nokterian: Microsoft keeps throwing money and i have a feeling there not done yet
[6:46:50] realsylos: @Kisswani On The Verge they said as much
[6:46:52] mavericks312: can we get a sylvanas orgin story show now
[6:46:55] DevilSpire: Damn
[6:47:00] Shalamyne: @Towelliee its a discussion on why the bought it with Bobby and Phil on CNBC
[6:47:04] RiggsTorvak: $68.7bn so round off to 69 spoone1Laugh
[6:47:08] Kisswani: @realsylos I'll check it out , thanks
[6:47:13] BoiAtomico: Honestly, Gamepass is fucking brilliant, I'd pay it if I was not subbing to WoW
[6:47:15] Maydie6066: Bobby Kotick has the voice of a man i want to just round house kick to the throat @Towelliee
[6:47:21] DatSheppy: Being force to buy a game pass sounds awesome :)
[6:47:23] Kisswani: towLets towGo
[6:47:27] Tzarvahl: WoW won't be on gamepass because wow isn't a buy to play game with an optional sub. eso is on gamepass cause you can just buy the game and play it, be realistic lmao
[6:47:27] KingsandClubs: @maydie6066 agree 100%
[6:47:39] camslam: so Bobby is gone?
[6:47:41] mmo_kenna_: I pay Gamepass and wow, and spend lots on ESO
[6:47:53] instant_savage: or u just get it now
[6:48:09] assman_ny: Another Nalak no go for me
[6:48:21] Kisswani: I wonder is they choose the wow on gamepass option how will it affect funding for new content and development
[6:48:26] CDubTheRIPper: COPIUM
[6:48:27] Herzenliegen: If Wow went game pass only it wouldn't be smart because not everyone has it nor do they want it.
[6:48:30] Reverez: who cares if its on gamepass lmfao
[6:48:31] Tickwick: they can just remove the sub
[6:48:33] CDubTheRIPper: crreamCope
[6:48:36] Toon11: they might make base wow game free to play like FF
[6:48:36] KingsandClubs: Can you watch the cnbc interview or is it also dmca?
[6:48:36] realsylos: There is absolutely 0 reason to buy ATVI otherwise. Microsoft really wants to become Gamers Netflix at this point. Sony is probably gonna respond by buying other Companies aswell, since they are now trying their pass aswell. Its definitely the future in Gaming aswell. Could be absolutely great, could be shit though too.
[6:48:38] CrusaderNero: maybe you then can play most of wow for free, but can also sub :)
[6:48:39] Kisswani: yeah
[6:48:39] BoiAtomico: Yeah, but management CHANGED
[6:48:41] akia03: and gamepass would kill the token
[6:48:41] Greveth: so who owns genshin impact because I bet they are rich af
[6:48:44] BoiAtomico: so there's that
[6:48:46] c0mmander_starscream: I dont have Gamepass and I would buy it
[6:48:50] DatSheppy: @Reverez because most people have no desire to buy one
[6:48:53] MILESkg21: then how would they make new content Kappa
[6:48:56] mmo_kenna_: ESO is expensive, expansions, DLC, ESO plus, store and loot boxes
[6:48:56] xXSiebzehnXx: I would pay a WoW + Game Pass discounted combo
[6:48:57] Montechriss: Its nothing wrong with blizzard business plans really.
[6:48:58] showmethesugar35: Cant wait to see the wow haters saying this is bad news
[6:48:58] Tickwick: gamepass is more players
[6:48:59] Shuttlelol: WoW on the gamepass is an incredible scenario, so many new players
[6:49:01] sharkey3322: mop classic pog Kappa
[6:49:05] Aidler: @Towelliee Phil and Bobby were on CNBC
[6:49:05] SnoWeazel: chat would be a really bad business man XD
[6:49:16] CrusaderNero: nah dude put wow on gamepass and have sub to for extra stuff
[6:49:18] mavericks312: this is about making money not being nice to the consumers
[6:49:19] realsylos: They make it because they need their games exclusively.
[6:49:19] ironforge_1337: man i can't believe Microsoft is buying Blizzard  :(
[6:49:22] DatSheppy: @Shuttlelol incredible loss of players tbh
[6:49:23] Shuttlelol: Put WoW on steam LULW
[6:49:26] ims0pwn: they'll integrate it in the gamepass price
[6:49:26] AbidDin: the'll probably have a better trial with gamepass.
[6:49:29] coffebreak: isnt microsoft one out of 2 AAA-rated companies left now?
[6:49:29] Staksor: I'd buy Game Pass if it had WoW subscription for sure
[6:49:29] spyrit14: wow will be on xbox lol
[6:49:31] Tickwick: more players would buy gamepass to play wow than pay a separate sub
[6:49:31] rosina_scarlett: yeah the video of Phil and Bobby is on wowhead
[6:49:31] Kisswani: I thought Microsoft was a not for profit organization D:
[6:49:35] Herzenliegen: @DatSheppy exactly and that's why I don't see it happening.
[6:49:40] Reverez: @DatSheppy its literally so similar in price who cares
[6:49:41] Bayne77: microsoft ISNT doing this to be altruistic?
[6:49:42] MILESkg21: LORD GabeN LuL
[6:49:42] firemedic005: also buying the companies before others do.
[6:49:43] 770Cash: I hope the warcraft universe can get some love with cinematics (shows, movies)
[6:49:51] Tzarvahl: @mmo_kenna_ eso is no more expensive than wow, if you just pay for plus and expansions. as a plus member, you get all dlc as long as you're subbed.. plus you get eso points to spend.
[6:49:52] DarqStalker: It‚Äôs amazing ms buying blizz. Can‚Äôt wait for all the games to be added to game pass.
[6:49:54] Montechriss: World of Gabecraft
[6:49:59] DatSheppy: @Reverez yeaa that's not enough of a reason
[6:49:59] cptrogers123: BATTLEPASS INCOMING TO WOW!! Sadge
[6:50:00] KingsandClubs: Well to be honest steam needs to step it up now since they might need to compete with microsoft now
[6:50:01] Shuttlelol: @DatSheppy who would stop playing WoW because its on the gamepass? sounds silly
[6:50:06] rosina_scarlett: @DarqStalker wow won't be added to gamepas
[6:50:13] BoiAtomico: You'd get more money from the people who don't play WoW who'd might be interested in playing WoW and then spending on the store services (mounts, pets, etc) than on the single expacs
[6:50:15] DatSheppy: @Shuttlelol i'm sure we would both be surprised by that number
[6:50:21] mustiparta: eso model is pretty fantastic tbh
[6:50:23] CCG_337: yeah... but it is all about about the micro transactions, that is why the headlines are about king and cod,
[6:50:25] GnomeLickerGames: they could count the game pass price for the sub in the end it still goes in the same pocket
[6:50:29] BoezIRL: hello everyone, what a crazy day @Towelliee towHAMUP
[6:50:35] H0bbitK1ng: its also super expensive to develop a game like wow, the sub is necessary
[6:50:35] BoiAtomico: You either choose to get a bulk of 40 once or small 5 at a time
[6:50:36] ShadowRuff: Petition for microsoft to change the name from jester to bobby gallywix
[6:50:37] xghostyyx: Will you play phase 3 TBC?
[6:50:39] mmo_kenna_: @tzarkiel Yeah but I spend alot more on ESO lol
[6:50:41] cptrogers123: @Towelliee rdy for incoming battlepass now microsoft owns blizzard LUL
[6:50:43] Herzenliegen: @Shuttlelol I would
[6:50:46] DarqStalker: We‚Äôll see @masumi_scarlett
[6:50:55] sifer007: KEKWlaugh
[6:50:55] Convectus: what was the site towellie used to see all the mounts per expansion?
[6:50:58] MILESkg21: FUCK SUNWELL KEKW
[6:50:58] Tzarvahl: @mmo_kenna_ they do have a lot more goodies on the store for sure haha
[6:51:02] Kisswani: I'm they'll have models available for all options anyway , and they'll decide based on what makes more money
[6:51:04] racketpunch: i thought TBC was your favorite expansion.  what happened?
[6:51:09] ShowDUH: @Convectus Simple Armory
[6:51:13] Aidler: @towelliee check wowhead for the CNBC interview
[6:51:14] CCG_337: are going to play Lost Ark?
[6:51:15] rosina_scarlett: @Convectus simple armory
[6:51:16] MagicMalTv: It‚Äôs definitely hitting game pass
[6:51:17] Convectus: @Showduh thanhks
[6:51:21] realsylos: But the Store will be longtime income. Expacs are just momentary. I'm pretty sure they wouldnt have Halo Day1 on Gamepass if they make not enough money lol
[6:51:21] KingsandClubs: Did you see the interview towlz with phil and bobby? @towelliee
[6:51:21] Nowack_hs: Mike Ybarra is a dreadlord
[6:51:25] DarqStalker: Diablo and overwatch prob for sure at least
[6:51:26] Shalestorm: Give me Tmog and stuff only available if i played then and to show off that i did? Yeah Sounds dope
[6:51:31] ims0pwn: MS will make the gamepass more expensive to get their Primary platform even more populatied. so wow will be cheaper for sure
[6:51:33] Sollice: So is meta-verse going to be the next word i blacklist in this channel. I am tired of the word already lol
[6:51:34] Thasin22: Do ppl think they are clever @ing Bill Gates lol
[6:51:38] neo_0098: how many phases does TBCC have?
[6:51:39] Kisswani: KEKW
[6:51:41] akia03: only the eso store changed after they got bought
[6:51:43] sifer007: KEKWDISCO
[6:51:43] iblighters: yeah I can't wait to pay a sub, buy the expansion and get the battle pass
[6:51:53] Divine_Miscreant: I have him up I can send an invite on Osha
[6:51:59] mavericks312: imma buy a boost run from mike this week just cause of today lol
[6:52:01] zarsz95: I couldn't help but notice Bobby dropping the metaverse buzzword a few times in that statement he sent employees
[6:52:01] ohnomyvirgineyes: you think token are become worth more gold?
[6:52:03] Tzarvahl: they arent going to touch WoW. the game makes too much money as it is, why change it? they know you're going to sub and buy expansions regardless lol.

[6:52:04] Tickwick: it's metaverse in one word Kappa
[6:52:09] Ludicruz: @Towelliee  Me and a friend of mine had a discussion about the new episode of blizzards wow subs,  we aggreed that expansions should be under the Xbox pass but the sub still the same,  what are your thoughs onn that ?
[6:52:17] Sollice: @zarsz95 He said it 3 times in 5 minutes on the CNBC interview
[6:52:17] DatSheppy: ...and then break it LUL
[6:52:21] rosina_scarlett: @Divine_Miscreant just inv him he will normally accept
[6:52:22] MagicMalTv: 2 years at least
[6:52:25] Borrgosh: What if they gona scrap wow... ;(
[6:52:33] beeneey: whats the addon your using is top left for mounts? @Towelliee

[6:52:49] AzizianQ: it will take years but the future is brighter now
[6:52:51] BoiAtomico: I could give you 40$ once or pay you regularly 5 and 10 over the course of 2 years. Wich would net more money? Now multiply that for the amount of new players. It's just tapping into a new source regular of income. Plenty of old WoW players on gamepass that might come back to WoW and spend that if it was included on gamepass, that don't play WoW by itself. Smell the moneys
[6:52:54] Energyzer9301: Cant wait for Forza x Warcraft collab
[6:52:57] zarsz95: @Sollice I didn't see that yet; it's just a little odd to me in a transaction like this that's what they're worried about
[6:53:00] neo_0098: wtf
[6:53:00] TheTacticalOwlz: you go fight the jailer but instead it's the ender dragon
[6:53:01] Sollice: WHO THE FUCK KNOWS WHAT META VERSE IS ITS JUST A NEW BUZZWORD
[6:53:03] DatSheppy: RIP WoW boys
[6:53:04] nihilistic_bat: Literally a buzz word
[6:53:05] camslam: im out on the metaverse
[6:53:06] DarqStalker: Imagine the next xpac on game pass. That‚Äôd be huge
[6:53:10] Toon11: a greener future
[6:53:17] Divine_Miscreant: I have up just need to the name typed out to invite because of my crap typing skills
[6:53:20] matx83: watch the youtube vid metaverse is said every other word
[6:53:24] Divine_Miscreant: Nalak^
[6:53:27] xXSiebzehnXx: @sollice I feel like people refer to it like this is Ready Player One
[6:53:28] CommenceDaRaging: might see something similar to eso imo, like extra bag space and mythics locked behind wow plus sub along with expansions etc etc
[6:53:32] cbiskit89: who read/watched Ready Player One and decided "yea let's do a metaverse IRL"
[6:53:32] rosina_scarlett: A metaverse is a network of 3D virtual worlds focused on social connection. In futurism and science fiction, the term is often described as a hypothetical iteration of the Internet as a single, universal virtual world that is facilitated by the use of virtual and augmented reality headsets. is what metaverse is
[6:53:38] RiggsTorvak: metaverse is like ready player one, you can race shoot do whatever in one game
[6:53:41] LeideGaming: FrankerZ
[6:53:43] Sollice: I think thats intention yes. It's a VR Oasis
[6:53:44] gimmlay: I'd be so hype to lay in bed and grind dailies and fish on my xbox lol
[6:53:45] BoiAtomico: And that's why MTX are the biggest earners in gaming KEKW
[6:53:47] zarsz95: Metaverse is literally just a buzzword describing a dream virtual world these execs think they can sell people on. No different than NFTs at this stage
[6:53:48] lovemymage: vr chat LUL
[6:53:50] stallowned: its that facebook VR bullshit
[6:53:52] mavericks312: didnt FB start the whole metaverse bullshit
[6:53:53] realsylos: Again If that would be more money in the long run, all the Day1 on Gamepass games wouldnt make sense
[6:53:55] CDubTheRIPper: im thinking the gamepass price goes up with the AVTI acquisition
[6:53:57] Daveybutter: so wow on console?
[6:54:02] Streamcrush: so it's basically Ready Player One
[6:54:02] Kisswani: KEKW
[6:54:03] severedfemoral: LOL
[6:54:04] iRage1776: @Towelliee Facebook = Metaverse
[6:54:05] gdtomii: KEKW TRUE
[6:54:05] blacksheep806: KEKW
[6:54:07] Fray24_: VR Porn is all I understood

[6:54:08] Nokterian: KEKW
[6:54:09] sifer007: KEKWlaugh
[6:54:10] BobLongMVP: You gotta be kidding towelliee how do you not know what meta verse is
[6:54:11] kubaal: they didnt buy a successful franchise to lessen the profit potential. I dont expect much to change, and Il cool with that
[6:54:11] Kisswani: that got me more confused KEKW
[6:54:11] xXSiebzehnXx: @cdubtheripper my guess
[6:54:13] MagicMalTv: @daveybutter nope, D4 yes.
[6:54:14] flebbooo: yeeep KEKW
[6:54:15] Sacura_Shadow: same
[6:54:18] Sollice: Aside that movie is an 80s kid dream
[6:54:21] CDubTheRIPper: @xXSiebzehnXx NODDERS
[6:54:23] Draugrs: metaverse is what Facebook is trying to start
[6:54:24] iRage1776: truth
[6:54:28] phisig: yo is it true Microsoft just bought activision blizzard?
[6:54:29] mavericks312: i dont need ar or vr bullshit
[6:54:38] neo_0098: @phisig yes
[6:54:38] RiggsTorvak: its gonna be like i can pull a CoD m4 in WoW while zoom calling
[6:54:39] ErrorFixx: kick Boby Kotick :P
[6:54:39] Kittastrophe: show up to work, get shit done and get paid.

[6:54:52] Sollice: @Towelliee Watch Ready Player One and you will get the idea
[6:54:55] xXSiebzehnXx: Something something FOR THE HORDE, something something
[6:55:02] Lulaboo: these people talking Microsoft meta are talking out of their ass
[6:55:11] Kisswani: hell , just do good PR and you'll be fine
[6:55:12] xXSiebzehnXx: @lulaboo GETTEM
[6:55:13] cptrogers123: So no change :(
[6:55:15] Borrgosh: Hopefully....
[6:55:17] BoiAtomico: @Lulaboo preach
[6:55:21] Squeak_Official: I think if anything Microsoft is gonna add nothing but benefits at this point in actiblizz
[6:55:22] DarqStalker: The acquisition won‚Äôt be complete until June 2023 or so
[6:55:28] Umbrella_corp_soldier: Can't wait for the Halo/WoW/CoD cross over
[6:55:37] CDubTheRIPper: or what if..microsoft just keeps things the way they are and they dont incorporate it into gamepass LUL
[6:55:40] RiggsTorvak: and youll be able to do your taxes in game
[6:55:46] pronkk_: alliance KEKW
[6:55:50] cptrogers123: so there is gonna be no change? its just gonna be the same shitty game thats gone downhill for years :( @Towelliee

[6:56:15] rosina_scarlett: @DarqStalker YES
[6:56:16] Wirulol: @Towelliee No afraid of a monopoly of shovel ware like the COD games?
[6:56:22] gooseboy429: more gamepass subs
[6:56:23] fat_european0: @Towelliee I imagine they wont have as much pressure on them since they'll be one of many studios instead of being one of the three flagship studios
[6:56:23] Dred_Scythe: @Towelliee Short and sweet clip for ya: https://clips.twitch.tv/FrailColdbloodedSardineCurseLit-QTHElrAUglT9A823
[6:56:35] Bestbud: every quarter we see activision's returns, it is a smart deal for any company to own them. take one of the biggest companies with its resources to expand is big.
[6:56:39] BoiAtomico: @vimie OH SHIT. A FALLOUT/ElderScrolls type game set in the Warcraft universe would be dope as fuck! Get obsydian!
[6:56:40] Kisswani: I hope QA will be a priority
[6:56:55] phisig: nah wow a dead game bro ;)
[6:56:56] mavericks312: basically 1 company owning everything

[6:57:00] cptrogers123: so there is gonna be no change? its just gonna be the same shitty game thats gone downhill for years :( @Towelliee

[6:57:44] Wirulol: @Towelliee I mean like will Blizzard just create more ass games now like how COD has become
[6:57:44] CDubTheRIPper: amazon was never really a game company though until recently
[6:57:50] BoiAtomico: @fat_european0 that would be dope as well! :P
[6:57:51] Maroleb: being contrarian for the sake of it

[6:59:02] Drekorve: Microsoft has a history of giving companies they buy whatever resources they need, so no matter which way you spin it this is great news for Activision Blizzard IPs.
[6:59:07] luckfore: you already did towbot no?
[6:59:17] Herzenliegen: Change is scary for some people so ofc there's going to be lots of questions. People have invested many years and hours of game play in this game.

[6:59:56] LowKeyGaming: 343 kiled it
[6:59:58] nocturnal_2195: I wonder if they'd ever bring a simplified version of WoW to Xbox because it would directly compete with FF14 on playstation and let's be honest ESO isn't exactly competing against FF14. I'm just being optimistic
[6:59:59] RiggsTorvak: what have the studios microsoft already acquired made so far?
[7:00:03] rosina_scarlett: Infinite is amazinfg

[7:15:45] CrunkyBrewster: dont answer
[7:15:46] Tzarvahl: @Thasin22 animation lock is because they put a lot of work into them, the "server ticks" are only because all servers are in one location per region and not everyone lives on top of them. If you vpn or use ff14alexander or whatever its called, the server tick issue isnt a thing
[7:15:47] Moobot: Who wins? https://strawpoll.com/cz3q7xfco

[7:19:56] incredendus: don't forget End of Dragons :)
[7:20:01] populuxxe: Is it possible to keep up with WoW now or do you still have to do a ton of WoW chores to just keep up? I really just wanna push keys and raid without having to do hours of chores.

[7:20:46] kokochris: I like FF14, and love watching @Towelliee but agree I rather play FF14 than watch it
[7:20:48] DragonofWolves: yeah I'm slowing down my FF14 story progression as I'm on ShB right now.
[7:20:50] randomgeneratedchad: its gay

[7:21:15] Ribastur0075: well famous wow streamers that streamed ff14 did pretty well tbh, nobble right now as an example
[7:21:15] Killulock: whens 9.2 coming
[7:21:17] CDubTheRIPper: LUL
[7:21:19] PittsburghDanny: Good luck then. I'll be back to your stream when you're back in FFXIV

[7:21:53] ShadowRuff: zack tweet
[7:21:58] RiggsTorvak: FF11 was my jam. its very different to 14
[7:21:59] magiccanvashands: so what did we learn kids? you can  assault women, and in some cases worse and just sell your company for fat dived ends and walk scott free.
[7:22:00] CrunkyBrewster: i just sent my little brother the MS info. he's in disbelief
[7:22:02] falldrgn: I doubt they will make any significant changes to the sub model
[7:22:03] Sielu11628: @Poriand I probably shouldn't have phrased my post that way. I meant to say, "Asmongold just woke up and made his post about the merger."
[7:22:05] DeanoTV: chat stop with the asmon tweet sheesh LUL
[7:22:13] RalgorStreams: I can see how it would be hard to stream though if you had already done the msq
[7:22:14] blacksheep806: Lulaboo
[7:22:16] blacksheep806: LUL *
[7:22:23] temp3st98: Yoshi-p literally said they want people to play oter games then just stuck to 1
[7:22:25] cptrogers123: @Towelliee What game are you most hyped for? Lost ark or Elden ring?
[7:22:40] Korupcija_: HAHAHAH
[7:22:41] Throkkz: I'm sniffing that HOPIUM :D
[7:22:52] Heero_Effect: Why people so dependent on what asmon thinks and not themselves?
[7:22:59] zodd_amhai: @temp3st98 or yoshi knows that FF14 dosent have enough content
[7:22:59] TJdps: you see that bobby is reportedly now stepping down after the buyout happens @Towelliee
[7:23:00] caldagnas: Apparently Microsoft isn't fully taking over until 2023.
[7:23:13] ItsDJDW: MW Remastered incoming!
[7:23:17] cptrogers123: @Towelliee What game are you most hyped for? Lost ark or Elden ring?
[7:23:19] HysteriaKO: cool story bro lol
[7:23:19] zodd_amhai: im never excited to play FF14 its just when we get WoW drought
[7:23:22] Norian45: Without knowing much about it. Do you think Microsoft owning Blizzard will be good or bad for WoW? @Towelliee
[7:23:23] Nokterian: FFXIV feels boring to watch
[7:23:26] Milanesa_De_Pollo: Anyone know when new PTR build is?
[7:23:30] Murlocz: @Towelliee You think theres anything Amazon could do to save New World?
[7:23:32] Nokterian: story wise is cool
[7:23:32] magiccanvashands: kotick probably has his own mini fridge of breast milk i wonder what Microsoft is going to say when they find it...
[7:23:33] DragonofWolves: I think some are upset that bobby is just being able to walk away from Activision with any punishment. I think there should be honestly
[7:23:37] populuxxe: I men, Activision/Blizzard is still going to run the show, Microsoft just owns it now.
[7:23:49] shtgamertag: and there current expansion stuff in such a lttle amount
[7:23:49] NYCFinest718: Towellie Nalak just spawned right after u logged off
[7:23:55] morningporr1dge: @populuxxe the boss changed. so it will change. bobby isnt in charge
[7:23:58] TexValhalla: GrittyTexan subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 46 months! 
[7:24:01] temp3st98: @zodd_amhai ive moved from wow to ffxiv, atleast to the next expansion ^^
[7:24:04] CrunkyBrewster: yup exactly populuxxe look at ESO. they're still the same. nothing has changed with that game
[7:24:08] pronkk_: why do people read that Bobby Kotick is laeving once the deal is complete, but dont read that the deal completes in June 2023
[7:24:11] Blazzerx: WoW is still king B)
[7:24:16] zodd_amhai: @temp3st98 i hope u enjoy it mate
[7:24:18] RiggsTorvak: bobby will be let go in a week
[7:24:20] falldrgn: We can only take so much Towlah Hee..
[7:24:21] Shiekrunner: it shouldnt be so controversial to play the game you like
[7:24:22] Funderik: imagine if after 6 weeks of a new wow expansion, ion says... ok guys take a break we got no content for abit... the RAGE the ANGER the MALDING... imagine
[7:24:22] blacksheep806: NODDERS
[7:24:25] morningporr1dge: @Blazzerx hands down no matter what anyone says
[7:24:25] joe_g_433: So glad to watch you in wow again

[7:24:38] mustiparta: @pronkk11 it completes BY june 2023, could be sooner
[7:24:38] itsTwigs_: i miss pandaria. was so relaxing
[7:24:43] ArcaneSyntax: @towelliee honestly, while i love FFXIV, i get immensely bored after the msq is done.
[7:24:44] sifer007: @Towelliee play what ever you want man
[7:24:50] CoffeeCatte: @Towelliee As a FFXIV only player, I am enjoying watching you play WoW while I play FFXIV.
[7:24:53] cineris_3: had to quit ff14 due to burnout from MSQ, they need to trim that down somehow
[7:24:54] azzurrin: FFXIV is boring tbh once you finish MSQ
[7:24:59] KingsandClubs: I‚Äôm a simple man i see you play anything i‚Äôm happy
[7:25:02] cptrogers123: Final Fantasy fans... They dont understand a no is a no @Towelliee
[7:25:05] populuxxe: @willybattery And they will still operate as a company. Doesn't mean Bill Gates comes in and runs WoW. It's not changing the dev roadmaps, I promise. They wouldn't have bought it if they wanted to redo the roadmaps completely.
[7:25:05] blacksheep806: I played ff14 first time in 2016 and I'm not even in heavensward yet KEKW
[7:25:08] Sacura_Shadow: it really shouldnt lol i cant even get into ffxiv to play lol dang ques
[7:25:10] JarJar_Brinkz: People who quit wow are just trying to validate their quitting through streamers also quitting... Theres a reason the WoW streamers are the only ones who pick up views in FFXIV
[7:25:13] luckfore: ive never seen a community look for validation harder than the ff crowd
[7:25:16] falldrgn: Streamer not playing what I want? REEEEEEE
[7:25:18] xXSiebzehnXx: @azzurrin I commend you for making it that far
[7:25:24] Valyxx: There's NOTHING to do in FF14 after the MSQ. Savage gets old after the first clear.
[7:25:27] Funderik: i'll sit here and watch you play anything, but ff14 is a nop from me dog SeemsGood
[7:25:37] cptrogers123: Final Fantasy fans... They dont understand a no is a no @Towelliee
[7:25:40] RiggsTorvak: FF14 needs mob claiming for me, no competition in camping
[7:25:47] Murlocz: Neither New World apparently
[7:25:50] azzurrin: @xXSiebzehnXx to be fair I skip a lot of cutscense LOLOL
[7:25:53] Nokterian: thats true
[7:25:54] Sadisticmedic: @Towelliee Bob Kotick Step down from Blizzard
[7:25:56] Nokterian: still is
[7:25:57] Korupcija_: but it's so good man!
[7:25:59] azzurrin: watch em later

[7:26:22] Moobot: No need to repeat yourself, @Fille1809 (warning)
[7:26:29] spyrit14: mutation patch is already on the ptr
[7:26:38] King_Jmann: thing is, I LOVE final fantasy right, but MSQ is really where it shines. After that it's kinda hard for me to stick to the game. But for WoW, I love just walking around the world, doing side quests, getting gear upgrades etc, WoW's main story is too hard to  really follow.
[7:26:38] Murlocz: @Towelliee You been working out lately?
[7:26:42] spyrit14: should launch by the end of the month
[7:26:49] TexValhalla: you excited for Legacy of the Sith @Towelliee ? SWTOR is the game i am currently playin rn
[7:26:53] Nokterian: MSQ is great in FFXIV and that's it for me.

[7:27:15] assman_ny: You got it, easy peezy
[7:27:20] blacksheep806: Lost 40kg in one year, ended my sleep apnea, feelsgoodman

[7:27:46] LordOverflow: Were you surprised about Microsoft news?
[7:27:46] KingsandClubs: I know this is kinda random towlz but i know you are cuban , just started spanish classes on monday any tips for learning spanish?

[7:29:15] Murlocz: @Fille1809 thats why EU sucks
[7:29:17] LordKain73: Merica baby, I'm free to die of covid if I wish baby!
[7:29:18] Staksor: @AngelsMatt, right. every raid tier is just 4 bosses of the same raid. no pvp, no anything similar to m+. nothing to do at max level, once you're done with MSQ. it's barely one month after EW release and I'm already bored and canceled my sub
[7:29:19] dragore87: bay area as well

[7:30:06] cptrogers123: It is literally impossible to get anywhere without a corona pass in EU @Towelliee
[7:30:07] CrispyNugs: cloth masks dont work lol no shit!!! you mean our etsy masks are not saving us all?!
[7:30:08] reffan: @Staksor this is looking at the end game from a wow perspective. you can turn it around and saying wow doesnt have anything once youve finished ksm and the mythic raid
[7:30:11] feherlofia123: @luckfore that should be illegal of the government to do
[7:30:12] gooseboy429: diablo 4 launch on gamepass
[7:30:14] dragore87: I wear my mask everywhere because I'm not an ass : /

[7:30:27] Bayne77: like a vax passport?
[7:30:28] eatonaround: so does phil spencer now do the voice acting for Thrall going forward since he's the savior? KEKW
[7:30:29] kokochris: @Screamnsteam you also need a covid pass in certain areas in Canada as well
[7:30:30] RiggsTorvak: phil big spendcer
[7:30:32] LordKain73: The more mandates the better. Fuck antivaxers! Ok, no more from me on the topic.
[7:30:34] Nokterian: Praise Phil pgePurpose
[7:30:35] LordOverflow_II: LordOverflow_II subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 113 months! towHAMUP towHAMUP towHAMUP towHAMUP Hope Microsoft brings back some of those classic Sierra games now that they'll get rights on those thru Activision Blizzard deal...
[7:30:35] miser_o: so phil will be new voice of thrall ?
[7:30:36] nocturnal_2195: @sollice LoL

[7:30:42] GRVPHX: its a ID confiermation that shows u have had your shots
[7:30:44] blacksheep806: We had the pass for few weeks and then they removed it because it didnt help with the spreading (surprise) LUL
[7:30:47] CrispyNugs: @dragore87 just know your chinese made cloth mask doesnt do anything but make you taste your own lip sweat
[7:30:49] ironforge_1337: @LordKain73 pussy
[7:30:50] GRVPHX: its almost like another form of ID now lol
[7:30:50] kokochris: just follow your local requirements.  easy as that.
[7:30:51] Nokterian: towHAMUP
[7:30:54] Naturalbeef: It them asking you for your papers
[7:30:54] falldrgn: Someone asked me for a Vaxx card when I was at the store the other day (unmasked) and threated to call security..lol
[7:30:58] Shuttlelol: 113 months jesus
[7:30:59] temp3st98: You need a covid pass for indoors meetings or a football game
[7:31:00] tuskanpoo: england are scrapping the pass end of this month
[7:31:01] Taz_85: Lot of places around here (Alberta) require the QR code system for entry. Gotta prove you're vaccinated
[7:31:04] AngelsMatt: @Staksor LUL,after u finish teh current raid tier for wow what you do?do you know nothing about bozja,relic,eureka,Potd,HoH,coleting mount,triple triad rare title?anything?
[7:31:07] LordKain73: @ironforge_1337 Cuck
[7:31:07] Rottencoarse: @Towelliee  phil spencer and bad bobby are on cnbc talking about the acquisition
[7:31:08] Sollice: @CrispyNugs No cloth mask does anything regardless of where you buy it. They are not filtered
[7:31:09] riley_poker: MoP was OG shit.
[7:31:10] neo_0098: that's ehat the covpass is in EU ;) Nothing special
[7:31:15] eatonaround: @LordOverflow_II if they bring back sierra games i'll freak out haha
[7:31:16] Nokterian: I wear a mask regardless
[7:31:18] populuxxe: I wear one no matter what. I don't trust idiots around here.
[7:31:19] MMOrpgPrincess: Just to be careful cause the vax does not prevent transmission,.
[7:31:20] WATWOOD: like npc
[7:31:20] Gotlandish: EU hardly has any restrictions, just some here that are sensitive from people asking for showing they dont have corona.
[7:31:20] Murlocz: KEKW
[7:31:21] CDubTheRIPper: LUL
[7:31:22] Aidler: I have all the certificates and passes
[7:31:24] Taz_85: Kinda funny people thinking their rights are being infringed upon when a private establishment refuses them entry
[7:31:25] sgtalash: AJJAJAJ
[7:31:25] dragore87: @CrispyNugs Yeah okay
[7:31:26] blacksheep806: LUL
[7:31:26] nelorixx: Was that a panther behind Towelliee?
[7:31:28] Valyxx: @AngelsMatt old content
[7:31:29] xXSiebzehnXx: I just went to a concert in Vegas, they didn‚Äôt require a mask or vaccination
[7:31:29] kappanostra: @towelliee  did you at least enjoy endwalker's MSQ?
[7:31:32] Screamnsteam: @kokochris Canada also admitted to tracking 80% of their citizens during lockdown
[7:31:32] CrunkyBrewster: Yup same here. I get strange looks in Wawa from the no-maskers and Im like whatever. the signs on the door
[7:31:34] CrispyNugs: @Sollice  right im just saying 99.99% of textiles are chinese made
[7:31:41] Sollice: Oh yea that may be true
[7:31:43] strchsr: @Towelliee I remember like, the day after I got my booster back in December, everywhere in CA required masks, I think it was for a month so maybe that ended a couple days ago?
[7:31:47] Shuttlelol: @Screamnsteam LULW
[7:31:48] crazy1god: @Towelliee Did you hear !? Activision buying beer for Microsoft ?
[7:31:49] neo_0098: 113 months are you kidding me? how many years is that?
[7:31:50] Murlocz: What do you usually use as pre workout? For the pump
[7:31:52] King_Jmann: fuck a vax
[7:31:54] JarJar_Brinkz: Kappa
[7:31:55] falldrgn: If a store wants me to wear a mask.. fine. I got no issue with it.
[7:31:56] populuxxe: I don't wear it for me, per se, mostly to protect others. I could carry that shit without having a clue and give it to some unvaxxed chump.
[7:32:01] kokochris: @Screamnsteam im Canadian, I support the lock downs and requirements.  Whats your point
[7:32:11] Murlocz: What do you usually use as pre workout? For the pump @Towelliee
[7:32:13] Thoreya: But a story is only told once so alas
[7:32:15] tuskanpoo: @populuxxe im sorry to say this but you are delusional
[7:32:15] Aidler: boosted ingame and out of game.. all the way
[7:32:16] kecke79: @Towelliee the corona pass is just basicly showing prrof ure vaccinated/  free of cov/  had covid and tested and not affected anymore,  many places doesnt let u in if dont have it to lessen risk of exposure :P
[7:32:16] AngelsMatt: @Valyxx so new content in wow is only the raid then?dg m+?LUL dude dont try
[7:32:19] centralqt: @neo_0098 well since there are 12 months in a year...
[7:32:19] cptsweatp4nts: For me KOTOR had best story
[7:32:20] dragore87: @populuxxe exactly
[7:32:21] Todmeister9000: better than the WoW story? D:
[7:32:25] Murlocz: C4 IS THE SHIT BRO

[7:32:27] Murlocz: SO GOOD
[7:32:28] populuxxe: @tuskanpoo why's that exactly?
[7:32:29] randomgeneratedchad: ??
[7:32:30] Korupcija_: C4 monkaS
[7:32:31] nocturnal_2195: Honestly it took seeing my step father getting covid inorder for me to get the vaccine
[7:32:31] Valyxx: @AngelsMatt you're still wrong but ok
[7:32:32] AureliusXV: could give it to a Vax chump too
[7:32:33] Dreadfrost: C4 knocking at your door :D
[7:32:33] AngelsMatt: @Topersan that even had to compare dude
[7:32:34] MMOrpgPrincess: The mask is literally the best protection from catching it in the first place, the vax is merely a therapy to reduce symptoms AFTER the fact.
[7:32:38] RiggsTorvak: so where does this 69 billion go, i see 1% going on games
[7:32:45] Staksor: @AngelsMatt, I do know about Eureka/Bozja, relics and stuff. the thing is it should be released with the expansion. the whole FF14 expansion feels like one WoW patch. deep dungeons, mounts, pets and acrds aren't endgame
[7:32:46] gdtomii: @Topersan that doesnt take much KEKW
[7:32:49] Murlocz: C4 is so good, it gets me pumped everyday
[7:32:50] Battakoru: Hi Tow! I;ve a question, what do u think about dragon islands leak? Maybe u commented, sorry for question that again... Best regards from Mexico :D
[7:32:55] Novahh: I‚Äôd like ffxiv If the pvp wasn‚Äôt ass
[7:32:57] Aidler: C4?
[7:32:59] Dimichsky: Here in Canada you need vaxx passport to go to costco lol
[7:32:59] Miguel85NYC: do they have avocado flavor @towelliee
[7:33:03] DragonofWolves: imo from what I played of FF14s MSQ so far, I like it better than SL buy that's me
[7:33:04] JarJar_Brinkz: @RiggsTorvak well how do you think money works for gaming companies?
[7:33:08] kokochris: @Screamnsteam good.  Please stay safe, regardless of where you live.
[7:33:17] xXSiebzehnXx: There are about 100 pres I could suggest over C4
[7:33:19] populuxxe: Our hospitals are jam packed. Just because someone is dumb enough to refuse to get vaccinated doesn't mean I should say "oh well, sucks to be you." I'm not going to add to the problem.
[7:33:25] Niksen_99: Is it difficult to get into WoW as a new player?
[7:33:31] gnomesarethebest: yes
[7:33:35] its_andyd: ROBERTO BIG DADDY GARCIA!!!!
[7:33:37] iGurgleMilk: Microsoft couldn't make their own good exclusives.... they had to buy them
[7:33:37] gnomesarethebest: wow is a dogsht game if ur new
[7:33:40] Murlocz: @Niksen_99 Not at all bro, get it rolling
[7:33:40] kappanostra: @niksen_99  yes sadly
[7:33:41] RiggsTorvak: @JarJar_Brinkz last i looked activision were sitting on 8 bn not putting much back into games
[7:33:45] AureliusXV: super pump was the shut back in the day
[7:33:49] Eastwicksavag3: yes
[7:33:51] Moobot: Calm it with those symbols, @Fille1809 (warning)
[7:33:52] malddktank: lore wise i'd say it is
[7:33:55] populuxxe: It's insanely hard to get into wow. There are SOOOOO many chores you have to do.
[7:33:55] MMOrpgPrincess: Well, it's still can be extremely fun, as long as your not looking at from the perspective of how do I get to end game?
[7:34:03] Sollice: @iGurgleMilk Isn't that what Sony does? Buy developers to get good exclusives?
[7:34:03] Tzarvahl: yeah man. i have almost 3k hours in ff14 and ill say this, dont let the ff14 fans fool you lol. we all play the exact way you do. we do the story, complete raids and take breaks
[7:34:05] tuskanpoo: just blocked the biggest shill, actually scares me how some people are so delusional
[7:34:06] populuxxe: Not a single person thinks wow is easy to get back into....
[7:34:06] Eastwicksavag3: need to get legendary conduits and gear
[7:34:10] Screamnsteam: @gnomesarethebest just don‚Äôt be new 4Head
[7:34:15] JiberishUI: starcraft FPSRPG incoming
[7:34:15] luckfore: dont boost to 60 though
[7:34:21] Niksen_99: Thank you
[7:34:24] SaDos: I quit wow when they told me in 9.1 that i had to farm my legendary all over again
[7:34:24] reffan: Venruki had a good video on how difficult it is to get into wow
[7:34:25] AureliusXV: those chores are your content
[7:34:31] populuxxe: I stopped like 2 months after SL and I find it hard to jump back into. There are 10 things I have to do just to do the stuff I want to do.
[7:34:33] Toon11: just the concept of leveling alone is good enough
[7:34:35] SaDos: actually n ot
[7:34:35] Murlocz: @Towelliee Dont you miss Rift old times?
[7:34:35] Melonbrew: xbox is streaming starcraft 2 haha nice
[7:34:37] zodd_amhai: people forget its actually harder to get into FF14 LUL
[7:34:43] Vivelli: @populuxxe same
[7:34:45] xXSiebzehnXx: @aureliusxv pres are usually good until at least v2
[7:34:47] AngelsMatt: @Tzarkiel and its ok to be like that,mmo have to be fun not 2nd job
[7:34:49] SaDos: it was sockets.. when they told me i had to refarm sockets i quit the game
[7:34:50] Murlocz: @populuxxe Thats why im only coming back next expansion
[7:34:54] boxxxxxxxxxxx: Feed the sheep
[7:34:55] JarJar_Brinkz: @RiggsTorvak And thats why I asked the question, just having a ton of money means nothing. The people actually working on the game are what matter
[7:34:55] AureliusXV: we don't mindthe shitters quitting
[7:34:56] iGurgleMilk: @sollice yeah they buy a studio to design and build the franchise, but microsoft just comes in to pick at the bones
[7:34:56] tedeen: i logged few days ago to retail, and when i saw how much i need to do i just said "fuck this shit" and logged out :D
[7:34:57] Snabido: "Borrowed power" is that when the class trainer teaches me ability? Keepo
[7:34:59] inj0shwetrust: I mean.... you do have a point
[7:35:02] MMOrpgPrincess: @Murlocz The first six months of Rift were soooo fun!
[7:35:04] Roaringkittylol: Not true, they google the guides and systems
[7:35:07] AureliusXV: cya
[7:35:11] Battakoru: : Hi Tow! I;ve a question, what do u think about dragon islands leak? Maybe u commented, sorry for question that again... Best regards from Mexico  :D
[7:35:11] NoDaggerTV: True
[7:35:19] Murlocz: @MMOrpgPrincess Yeah i love it, it was the first game i saw Tow streaming
[7:35:23] happybooger: !yt
[7:35:23] Moobot: @happybooger Towelliee booted up his YouTube channel again! Check out the latest YouTube video HERE || Towelliee Reacts to 10.0 Leaks!! youtu.be/RMF7zwsjYGU
[7:35:23] grapyz: When I first started wow I didnt know lfg existed so I was actually going around doing classic quest lol
[7:35:25] populuxxe: I understand your point, but some brand new players are familiar with MMORPG games in general, and that's the tall task.
[7:35:26] JarJar_Brinkz: Venruki video was so off LUL New players do not have issues playing the game
[7:35:29] Arcmourn: Just tell any new player that they'll have to grind 28 days for flying lol ... yeet
[7:35:30] Nivaly: Borrowed power is just a number on the dps meter.
[7:35:32] Namtarts_TV: hard disagree with that
[7:35:35] grapyz: then I saw lfg and wow changed for me lol
[7:35:41] kappanostra: torghast was the biggest disappointment on shadowlands
[7:35:46] Sollice: @iGurgleMilk I don't see the difference. Sony didn't come up with the idea the studio does.
[7:35:50] Herzenliegen: I won't be playing Lost Ark but I excited to watch @Towelliee play it.
[7:35:51] luckfore: the guy even boosted to levle 60 and was clueless
[7:35:53] Shiekrunner: wish there was still visions :(
[7:36:00] Sollice: Sony thinks they have a good idea or they have published a great game and they buy them
[7:36:01] mallicar: if anything the issue is how fragmented the content is for a new person. You level up to like 50ish and then everything you are doing gets cut off. Several big storylines and similar things you become familiar with will get cut off
[7:36:08] Roaringkittylol: Many of the new players google guides and watch youtube videos and then see what they need to do and start playing then realize yea this sucks
[7:36:11] populuxxe: I think that's insane.
[7:36:27] lovemymage: they should disable 60 boost for new players
[7:36:30] Tzarvahl: thing is in this day and age, people know exactly what they want earlier than ever before. they hear some shit they feel ike they won't like, thats it
[7:36:31] AngelsMatt: the problem in wow for me is the that the grinding is locked in so many ways to vertical that feels like a job man every expac=new system,new dailies,new farm, and so on
[7:36:33] Murlocz: @Towelliee Did you liked doing GW2 fractals at all?
[7:36:34] JarJar_Brinkz: @Yoloblocks I dont think you know many new players who do that LUL
[7:36:34] inj0shwetrust: It is wayyyyy more easy now than it was in 9.1
[7:36:39] Poriand: i still hate WoW lvling
[7:36:41] TwoStripes: So one guy did it and the game is automaticly shit for new players, give me a break.
[7:36:43] tedeen: but the hell like to do thorgast for 5000 time because there is new BIS legendary
[7:36:44] populuxxe: Even just leveling, it's hard to even know where the hell you level. Chromie time is familiar to us people who've played it.
[7:36:45] SaDos: KEKW
[7:36:45] MMOrpgPrincess: Yes! It would be best to put it back in a linear mode.
[7:36:53] Divine_Miscreant: Last couple have been me lol
[7:36:56] xXSiebzehnXx: Sounds like someone who is lazy as fuck and really didn‚Äôt want to play with his friend
[7:37:01] Moobot: No need to repeat yourself, @Fille1809
[7:37:01] Kisswani: I imagine new players would enjpy exile's reach . I think it's a great introduction to the game
[7:37:08] Screamnsteam: Cartel EZ
[7:37:09] Murlocz: @Towelliee Did you liked doing GW2 fractals at all?
[7:37:12] StreamElements: Use code POG-TOWEL120 for $120 off at https://strms.net/TowellieeFactorBot #ad
[7:37:25] CrustieOCE: I got nalak on like 4th kill on whole account FeelsGoodMan
[7:37:37] Divine_Miscreant: Steamweadle is an RP server
[7:37:38] LadyJasmin: but if there was a mount...
[7:37:41] luckfore: LUL
[7:37:48] Morphlink: the "new" player experinse zone sucks. the old one was much better. imo
[7:37:49] Staksor: @populuxxe, that's why Chromie Time isn't available for new players elinaHmm
[7:37:53] RiggsTorvak: i got midnight, prolly my rarest
[7:38:00] zodd_amhai: GW2 is actually more fun than FF14 imo
[7:38:20] Murlocz: @zodd_amhai I kinda agree tbh
[7:38:20] populuxxe: I just want to get to endgame and do endgame. I don't like having to do pvp and dailies here, dailies there, torg, etc. just to keep my toon capable of getting group invites.
[7:38:29] SaDos: @zodd_amhai depends on what you want from the game... if you want to run around and look cool yeah but if you want challenging content with meaningfull rotation then no
[7:38:35] Screamnsteam: Got the sha Mount on my 2nd kill in mop but never used it because it was ugly LUL
[7:38:38] Sollice: Where the fuck is DEMONE with Lost Ark videos. He needs to get on that for content
[7:38:39] Korupcija_: you're right towelliee
[7:38:47] blacksheep806: Sollice LUL
[7:38:52] Namtarts_TV: i dont think comparing WoW right now to Lost Ark is a good one
[7:38:56] Murlocz: Man the GW2 color system is so DOPE
[7:38:56] Siddyy: OhMyDog

[7:39:20] populuxxe: @JarJar_Brinkz You didn't even have to do that in WoW back in the day.
[7:39:26] JarJar_Brinkz: @populuxxe in which game can you just finish leveling, and start playing endgame forever without anything else?
[7:39:34] JarJar_Brinkz: @populuxxe oh, so attunement didnt exist?

[7:40:47] Murlocz: @hanlif What does jaded means tho
[7:40:48] Xanigh: i like the animation u get around u when u have the full set of shards

[7:41:26] rosina_scarlett: the only thing that sucks about new players in WoW is if they start as alliance

[7:42:06] camslam: you KNOW Billy Gates has a tauren druid
[7:42:07] Murlocz: @Towelliee Any chance next expansion is really good and make a lot of players to come back to the game?
[7:42:11] Funderik: he might have imput on 10.2 onwards tho, they have 10.1 in the works at this point. so it's too late.
[7:42:13] Riuujin_: just waiting for that office365 intergration
[7:42:17] Kisswani: we dont work like that , Phil is already getting credit for the success of the next expansion Kappa
[7:42:23] populuxxe: I promise you, WoW has had their roadmaps determined for at least 2 years. There's nothing Microsoft is doing that will have an impact before WoW prolly dies out.
[7:42:28] Austei: yeah lol
[7:42:29] Aidler: WoW in the Microsoft Store
[7:42:38] c0mmander_starscream: Bill Gates hasn't run  Microsoft since the '90s lol
[7:42:42] cptrogers123: Then we need a new development team KEKW
[7:42:45] Jiraiya110: Microsoft buyout might motivate the current devs one can hope
[7:42:48] Manabucho: wow on battlepass????
[7:42:50] nothumbgamer_ttv: wow subscription on game pass??
[7:42:56] kappanostra: the roadmaps are there

[7:43:04] Tyrsfal: WOW kotick agreed to leave in time
[7:43:04] Murlocz: Any chance we can play WoW on Xbox?
[7:43:05] Shuttlelol: microsoft should buy Square Enix too
[7:43:08] populuxxe: You know how painful it is to change a roadmap.
[7:43:08] Nokterian: @Towelliee Xbox Game Pass breaks 25 million subscribers
[7:43:11] populuxxe: That's a lot of planning.
[7:43:13] kappanostra: the problem comes in those road maps being shit LUL
[7:43:16] orizont2k: I wonder..... maybe this is the reason that they sh!t on the Shadowlands.....because the intended to sell it ! :)

[7:43:29] Funderik: all the grey boxing on the areas and quest paths are first.
[7:43:35] Sollice: @orizont2k You dont drive your stock price DOWN before a sale lol
[7:43:39] Aidler: they have a lot of work ahead of them
[7:43:39] Tzarvahl: @ogthumbless no, why would they do that? they just spent 70B lol, they need to make their money back and they know everyone is going to sub/buy expansions every time
[7:44:00] populuxxe: That's part of the roadmap.
[7:44:02] michaelmm: They do it's called a Code Freeze.
[7:44:03] orizont2k: @orizont2k Oh yeah good point..... but maybe the price was fixed already a few month ago ???
[7:44:15] akia03: @Towelliee have you ever tried the razor tarturus v2 keypad?

[7:44:32] cptrogers123: we need a new development team KEKW @Towelliee
[7:44:42] Kryssner: I hope Ion Hazzikostas will leave, since 2016, when he got the Game Director role, we had 2 shit expansions.
[7:44:47] lamerterry: just make more talents and bring back mulit spec
[7:44:57] its_andyd: LETS GO ROBERTO BIG DADDY GARCIA!!!!!!
[7:45:01] Sollice: It's called "Post Go Live optimization" and it is a part of normal projects that are time sensitive
[7:45:02] rosina_scarlett: @Kryssner ???? legion was good the fuck you on
[7:45:04] Aidler: @fille1809 many are relatively new
[7:45:07] ZakuzaGB: so whats the fix for that just make less crazy systems
[7:45:11] ripripripripripriprip: skyrim music is so good
[7:45:13] nothumbgamer_ttv: @Tzarkiel they would still get subscription from game pass, and more people will maybe use game pass, also maybe microsoft change ports so wow can be played on xbox? theyre powerful console enough now
[7:45:20] nothumbgamer_ttv: who knows what happens next
[7:45:24] ShadowRuff: what was the anduin video is there a link?
[7:45:25] Arcmourn: I'm wondering if they do an additional services thing for game pass, eg. +$5 get you a wow sub ect.
[7:45:27] itsTwigs_: next expansion level 60 still or 70?
[7:45:28] Sollice: You prioritize what you need to get the product out the door and than you polish what you can past the Go Live
[7:45:31] Funderik: @Kryssner the last patch was good, the rest was meh
[7:45:36] orizont2k: I mean they cut of employees made a shit show on shadowlands......so maybe the word that they will sell was a few month o year back
[7:45:36] micofficial1: All these systems literally are just in place to keep replacing what our old talents did back in the day
[7:45:43] populuxxe: You can't just tell a team to change what they're working on mid sprint. They have teams dedicated exclusively to bug fixes more than likely, and those probably have waterfall sprints.
[7:45:48] Alegnowar: Really, Who?
[7:45:57] zodd_amhai: wait who is being replaced?
[7:45:57] Vivelli: WH OMEGALUL
[7:46:02] showmethesugar35: John left?
[7:46:05] Aidler: @kryssner me too. For me Ion is part of the old Blizz aka part of the problem
[7:46:05] Tzarvahl: @ogthumbless yeah, but gamepass for pc is 5 dollars less than what wow is a month. what'll end up happening, is they'll put all activision games on gamepass and keep wow separate
[7:46:07] orizont2k: I wonder when they decided to sell it :)
[7:46:14] GiraffeHydra_: To be fair, they had support from a decent chunk of the userbase, and they wanted to ride that wave
[7:46:16] populuxxe: Level 130.
[7:46:23] kappanostra: it was t John Heigh with the meaningful choice memes @towelliee it was Ion
[7:46:26] Malarick: ah D2 music.  so nice
[7:46:30] ZakuzaGB: i dont see the point in making the level cap 70 they should just roll us back to 50 each time now
[7:46:30] NotEnoughMana: dont forget 20 extra classes
[7:46:31] Lemon_King: Good ole EQ1 style AA Points.
[7:46:33] Red_Queen____: I just killed that guy for 950th time, still no damned mount xD
[7:46:37] Drewbertttt: next expansion: every character is deleted and you have to use windows 11 to play wow
[7:46:46] kokochris: ah love the D1 music
[7:46:52] ShadowRuff: Any one has teh meme video of the anduin cinamatic
[7:46:56] squirmyjay: @Towelliee so how do you justify  BC push back date. They can push it back.They just know there is more social media bolshit involved  now. BC was the best expansion and it got pushed back 6 months
[7:46:56] Orion280: wait you think we are getting another level squish?
[7:46:59] Heero_Effect: I heard the next expansion will be paid for with cash
[7:47:02] Mo0fal: was there?
[7:47:05] Kryssner: @Funderik last patch was better, but not good
[7:47:10] ZakuzaGB: did that positivity change when they actually played it?
[7:47:10] nothumbgamer_ttv: @Tzarkiel i dont think i have spent real money on wow sub for a while now, not played that often recently, and still have 1.2M gold but i use game pass^^
[7:47:10] Vivelli: yep, lots of ppl wanted it, but didnt pan out i think
[7:47:23] Funderik: you mean????? YOU THINK YOU DO BUT YOU DONT???? no way the players don't know what they want Kappa
[7:47:24] kappanostra: those people were wrong lul
[7:47:30] Nachofez: it would have been cooler if the covenant powers were more balanced at launch
[7:47:31] Tommo5000: Blizzard did a really good job with communication up to shadowlands release and I think that bought a lot of good will
[7:47:33] Dolphinos7: dom shards destroyed alts
[7:47:33] Shiekrunner: i just remember people shitting on it lol
[7:47:35] Alegnowar: @Towelliee are they really replacing John Hight? who will be his successor
[7:47:51] Kisswani: KEKW
[7:47:54] chavodk: KEKW
[7:47:55] JarJar_Brinkz: KEKW
[7:47:56] Vivelli: lol
[7:47:57] RiggsTorvak: you want an alt, grind it
[7:48:02] carma59: this mf in 2007
[7:48:05] Aidler: there was a lot of support for the meaningful choice shit. it was sad
[7:48:07] rosina_scarlett: @jasonklingelhutz my guy that was in 2007 LUL
[7:48:12] kokochris: fucking jumanji strikes again
[7:48:14] randomgeneratedchad: @Towelliee wait are they kicking Ion out ?
[7:48:15] matxainaz: !RFW
[7:48:17] Alegnowar: did he went into another team?
[7:48:21] Killulock: guess on 9.2 date?

[7:48:27] squirmyjay: You are saying there is date that need to hit. in reality there isnt. they can do what they please and make it better.
[7:48:29] Birder_L: john has gone up
[7:48:30] Valyxx: @Towelliee do you think this means the end of Blizzcon?
[7:48:36] DubakuMatumbo: Ion KEKW silence since 1 year
[7:48:37] ZakuzaGB: I think Ion is still good dude
[7:48:38] chavodk: yall live in 2022 but this mf lives in 2007
[7:48:42] micofficial1: Ian needs to get packed up
[7:48:42] antori_92: antori_92 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 87 months! 
[7:48:43] Thasin22: They need to just get rid of classic
[7:48:44] bump: XBoX Con
[7:48:47] Zivs: they are looking for a senior game directior or something tho
[7:48:51] Sollice: @jasonklingelhutz That is so untrue :P
[7:48:54] michaelmm: John Height's been moved to a new role of General Manager of the Warcraft Franchise.  They are advertising for a replacement Exec producer.
[7:48:54] Storm1854: he's the general manager of WoW now, bot executive producer
[7:48:55] gooseboy429: bliizxcon
[7:48:56] c0mmander_starscream: I could see Ian getting taken out
[7:48:57] Vivelli: KEKW
[7:48:58] juaniz123: Whats a good class if u want to get into wow as a dps? Something that still has a learning curve so that u can continue to play it
[7:48:59] raiwist: obama
[7:49:00] Alegnowar: Vivendi
[7:49:04] Bayne77: ummmm.  ubisoft?
[7:49:05] JarJar_Brinkz: me :)
[7:49:06] 00joseph: blizz?
[7:49:07] Birder_L: yes general manager now
[7:49:08] Vivelli: me :)
[7:49:08] Rottencoarse: was it Vivendi
[7:49:11] Tzarvahl: @ogthumbless they will be able to double dip most wow subs, once new blizzard games are added to gamepass. example being diablo 4. what ur suggesting loses them a fuck ton of money, itll never happen
[7:49:13] cineris_3: Activision
[7:49:13] Rottencoarse: Acti?
[7:49:15] Alegnowar: Activision
[7:49:15] micofficial1: Ian completely changed the game we loved and implemented a bunch of systems

[7:49:36] c0mmander_starscream: Asmongold
[7:49:41] Namtarts_TV: so no, thats not what happened
[7:49:41] ZakuzaGB: you think Msoft will be less strict?
[7:49:44] Moobot: No need to repeat yourself, @Fille1809
[7:49:46] Sonatta: when it's done
[7:49:48] Sollice: Of course they did. They have to make quarterly financials
[7:49:50] Namtarts_TV: vivendi bought both and merged them
[7:49:56] Namtarts_TV: activision never owned blizzard
[7:49:57] chris80m: yeah but activision set dates are ruining the game
[7:49:58] DDPrime: MS delayed Halo 1 year...
[7:50:00] assman_ny: And Activision is push it out on this date and that is it
[7:50:07] Namtarts_TV: a parent company bought both and made them one
[7:50:08] JiberishUI: Microsoft is going to let Blizzard take their time w/ their games and get back to what they used to be
[7:50:09] ZakuzaGB: From what you can see with msoft they usually let devs do their thing?
[7:50:10] DutDuck: @ZakuzaGB i also think microsoft has a bigger backing to help provide what is needed
[7:50:11] Namtarts_TV: for asset accumualtion
[7:50:16] Breakthecause: Microsoft will be less strict because they have a ton of First Party IPs to switch dates around
[7:50:18] Tommo5000: Are we feeling good about the microsoft thing then? I dont know enough to know how to feel.
[7:50:22] bump: Heroes of the Storm going into Game Pass!
[7:50:25] h00rayforstuff: if MS were as tight about timelines as Activision, we'd have an update on Elder Scrolls VI
[7:50:27] squirmyjay: @Sollice but its really not. how much shit gets pushed back.
[7:50:35] Thoreya: LUL
[7:50:39] Thoreya: john height smh
[7:50:45] wheatleyzor: Microsoft ended up pushing back Halo just to make the quality of it better, making their flagship-game release waaaay later. That says a lot
[7:50:45] Jindo_ZG: Why did Legion have such amazing content cycles compared to the other expansions
[7:50:47] Valyxx: @Towelliee do you think this means the end of Blizzcon?
[7:50:53] Alegnowar: Under microsoft we can finally have some Starcraft content that doesn't have to make 1Bn $ a year
[7:50:56] DutDuck: @ZakuzaGB yea thats how xbox arcade got started it was a platform for indy developers to get their work out
[7:50:57] Reddaye: Activision relied a lot on the few games they'd actually release for their revenue. MS don't have this problem
[7:50:57] Divine_Miscreant: Any idea if you have another WM on toon? I have him up again.
[7:51:02] kokochris: lol
[7:51:03] BenEaton: KEKW
[7:51:09] gdtomii: he said BLIZZCON
[7:51:10] Sollice: @jasonklingelhutz They are a for profit company. If they tell investors they expect to make so jmuch in quarterly profits, unless its ABSOLUTE doom they are pushing products
[7:51:16] Storm1854: they pushed halo infinite a year
[7:51:17] assman_ny: And I love that
[7:51:19] Aidler: Bobby agreed to leave after the transition period... good
[7:51:20] Valyxx: I said Blizzcon not Blizzard lol
[7:51:21] raiwist: yes send all your gold to me before you do though
[7:51:21] mezza77: so from Cata onwards was Activisions doing... makes sense
[7:51:23] RiggsTorvak: microsoft just dont impress me as software makers and make alot of bad choices
[7:51:26] Eastwicksavag3: yeah
[7:51:26] AvoidtheHat: End? LUL
[7:51:27] Korupcija_: that means wow devs can start drinking at work again!
[7:51:28] NiteOwl11617: They literally did that with Halo
[7:51:29] Grunton: look how they delayed halo years
[7:51:35] Eastwicksavag3: they delayed halo they dont care lol
[7:51:36] Tzarvahl: @Jindo_ZG i'm not sure, but i think they stopped dev on WoD early to work on legion. basically. it proves they need more than 2 years to make good expansions.. not sure why they do that lmao.
[7:51:37] Heero_Effect: Look T halo
[7:51:37] zarod89: WoW is a tiny investment for something the size of MS
[7:51:38] DutDuck: @RiggsTorvak like what choices?
[7:51:39] Reddaye: they didn't cancel Quakecon. They won't cancel Blizzcon
[7:51:45] herraticc: It'll be at the Microsoft theatre now
[7:51:45] chris80m: i dont think bliz con will happen again
[7:51:50] bump: Master Chief pet in WoW is going to be awesome, lol.

[7:52:03] NickFPV: From what I have spoken to Rare employees, Microsoft keeps them very autonomous
[7:52:04] Herzenliegen: Minecraft is a good example on how they are okay pushing games back if it isn't ready.
[7:52:06] Chon_Lee: How long till MS makes it F2P
[7:52:17] NiteOwl11617: I really want MS to course correct some of Blizz's stupid E-sports decisions.

[7:52:32] Onisekai: So we can expect "microsoft changes" in 11.0 maybe 10.3 ?
[7:52:33] AvoidtheHat: MS are doing really smart buys laterly
[7:52:34] tedol: @Chon_Lee game pass?

[7:53:24] AureliusXV: nobody gonna play wow on xbox
[7:53:27] Sollice: I didn't say that, but you have to look at what other IPs may be coming out that quarter. There is going to be less pressure from them to release say an expansion if a COD comes out that quarter

[7:54:13] zsoltix30: Or Blizzsoft :D
[7:54:16] Alegnowar: i hope microsoft expand the teams
[7:54:17] piratechris: Not a chance
[7:54:19] propoopimus: or from 200 to 50 KEKW
[7:54:19] Aidler: MS is not without flaws but Nadella made a modern company out of them
[7:54:20] alextheblight: here's hoping
[7:54:21] tigress75422: think microsoft will make things better overall
[7:54:23] ExigentMidnight: Seeing the Microsoft Games Studio logo at the start of D4 or WoW is going to be surreal

[7:54:26] TritonXXXG: they understand development better than activation and their three studio rotation
[7:54:26] ZansTeamCaptain: why wouldnt bliz dissolves into microsoft game studios. and they just call it microsoft game studios
[7:54:27] arcaniia007: @Sandisy i agree with you

[8:19:15] dracullus: bobby kotick gaming buys microsoft
[8:19:16] Melonbrew: Few years ago people keep sayng Microsoft was gonna leave the gaming business, Now they spent nearly $80 Billion dollars in the past 2 years
[8:19:26] reverbsoul1: Doubtful. Tencent is half the market cap of Amazon.
[8:19:37] wvivar: @ferguscreative what‚Äôs the point? Can‚Äôt make qc and developers any dumber.
[8:19:43] bonebride: the CCP wont allow that to happen
[8:19:44] ShadowRuff: @Aidler not bigger then sony micro nintendo tencent

[8:19:58] Mazeltough: @tibbus1730 why? its a game development platform that really is great for teaching kids how the process can work. yeah alot of the games are simple and similar
[8:20:11] Dreathhammer: Could you dispel some of the worries about people fearing microsoft owning blizzard and so many other companies? Some people on my realm are more worried than hopeful
[8:20:12] Kisswani: KEKW

[8:20:26] FergusCreative: @wvivar because he is the one fueling the toxic environment. With him gone I am hoping it improves
[8:20:26] cruzeal: towOof

[8:21:00] Bayne77: did you say Bobby Coatcheck?
[8:21:01] CLOUDSOFF: Someone buy EA and cken house ,,, need some good EA games
[8:21:09] Cosmolus: Bring Microsoft all the way
[8:21:14] Ch0p_Su3y: Bobby should leave today to my opinion
[8:21:16] yokai_5: a new era begins with a new change GandalfPls
[8:21:22] Rottencoarse: @Towelliee  clean house
[8:21:26] KingofMeccano: XBOX are doing a starcraft 2 stream atm welcoming activision blizzard
[8:21:26] Eduardlion: bro i love microsoft
[8:21:26] spiritowltv: I'm completely ok for Microsoft to take over Blizzard and Activision
[8:21:31] Ryzir: Microsoft = F2P/P2W?
[8:21:44] Imprexive: maybe overwatch 2 will now be completed
[8:21:45] bonebride: Bobby wont leave the cash cow
[8:21:49] H0bbitK1ng: bobby leaving today also does nothing before 10.0
[8:21:49] wvivar: @ferguscreative there‚Äôs another a hole ready to be toxic. All jobs are toxic. You can‚Äôt make people do better jobs with out creativity unless you been gone to mars the lack of creativity in WoW has been around for 7-9 years now. Bobby is a part of it but also directors and developers.
[8:21:58] Folgrum: WoW needs a big change, i hope microsoft will be change for better. in current state i quit wow, now ill look forward to next expansion
[8:22:11] Cosmolus: Hmm idk about that. Depends on the contract and the board need to approve his resignition.
[8:22:15] Blah206: Update 2: According to the Wall Street Journal, sources familiar with the deal say Activision CEO Bobby Kotick is set to leave after the deal closes. Despite contradictory statements saying that Kotick "will continue to serve as CEO of Activision Blizzard," the two companies agreed that Kotick will depart once Microsoft acquires Activision Blizzard.
[8:22:20] Proxzo: @Ebalina It seems like from an inteview, Bobby is leaving after the deal is sealed.
[8:22:20] Ch0p_Su3y: yes but he can take some long vacations and take no direct decisions on following projects
[8:22:24] PumpMasterFlow: It took like 6 months+ for bethesda to go through, this will be like 8 months to a year for this one
[8:22:26] pjahj: He wouldn‚Äôt leave now, he will get a massive golden parachute once the merger is done
[8:22:36] gdtomii: W
[8:22:37] bonebride: @Proxzo yeah but thats what i mean he wont till that things happen
[8:22:40] Aidler: Tencent is more then 700 billion. that's difficult to pull of
[8:22:53] c0mmander_starscream: the guy is too toxic to stay after Microsoft takes over
[8:23:01] nothumbgamer_ttv: @Aidler not for amazon xD
[8:23:03] Exxcar: Exxcar subscribed at Tier 3. They've subscribed for 27 months! 
[8:23:08] xlbuddha: What are the chances Microsoft snag Take Two after buying Zynga?
[8:23:14] wvivar: There‚Äôs reports that Bobby will make roughly half a billion in stocks
[8:23:17] yokai_5: overwatch 2 / heroes of the storm support continuing / a better diablo 4 / maybe the starcraft MMO blizzard promised in 2002
[8:23:29] c0mmander_starscream: He's just the place holder until they take over
[8:23:33] Blah206: LUL
[8:23:35] Bayne77: he just wants his stapler
[8:23:37] bonebride: kottik will be bought out and gone when the deal is done
[8:23:38] GamerGeek21: @Towelliee If I start playing wow with a trial, can I access all the old expansion content or no???
[8:23:45] Cosmolus: Yeah probably. Microsoft will just assign a director for Activision
[8:24:01] tedtalkz: riot MMO waiting room
[8:24:05] nothumbgamer_ttv: @Ebalina kottik has already said hes staying for the transition then resigning
[8:24:05] Aidler: @neurais Mike?
[8:24:12] PumpMasterFlow: I would appreciate them fixing Warcraft 3 at least
[8:24:16] CDubTheRIPper: Pretty sure at i reports to phil after this is all said and done
[8:24:17] Truebass: starcraft 3
[8:24:19] nelorixx: \ o /
[8:24:22] CDubTheRIPper: Atvi*
[8:24:26] spiritowltv: What a great guy
[8:24:28] Rottencoarse: @Towelliee  we need a phil emote now lol

[8:24:32] Zivs: \ o / Phil \ o / KEKW
[8:24:34] Exxcar: WoW Sub as part of Gamepass Ultimate when?!
[8:24:35] TheHardcorian: Bye bye Bobby hopefully
[8:24:36] ChaoticPriest: Here's one. What if Sony buys EA? Sony needs something to combat CoD, that's a foot in the right direction @Towelliee
[8:24:38] JiberishUI: Xbox twitch channel already playing starcraft hahah https://www.twitch.tv/xbox
[8:24:46] CGd0c: CGd0c subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 11 months! 
[8:24:46] Cosmolus: @Aidler Or probably will escalate Mike to the Director/CEO of Activion+Blizzard
[8:24:51] KnsWoW: @Towelliee can we get an MMO Overlord emote?
[8:24:51] piratechris: Most likely the whole dev teams around Wow etc will be completely re-organized in a year or two. That is way more likely than Microsoft throwing people at them and would be very unprofesional and against comon sense.
[8:24:57] tedtalkz: OMEGALUL
[8:24:58] bonebride: @ogthumbless a fancy way of saying gimme my money and i'm gone :D
[8:25:01] spiritowltv: Wow 2?
[8:25:04] GamerGeek21: @Towelliee If I start playing wow with a trial, can I access all the old expansion content or no???
[8:25:16] KingsandClubs: They gonna say we need unreal engine 5 LUL
[8:25:22] nothumbgamer_ttv: @Ebalina pretty much xD
[8:25:22] George2001k: Ban League of Legends from pc‚Äô
[8:25:27] cidthesloth420: @GamerGeek21 i think only up to lvl 20 or something
[8:25:27] MoistyBlizz: wow is gonna get so much better with Microsoft money backing it
[8:25:30] QuigsTV: @towelliee gotta make daddy spencer happy LUL
[8:25:31] Shrenko: cohhBongos
[8:25:33] Herzenliegen: You can only go to 20
[8:25:40] nelorixx: lvl 20 max?
[8:25:41] Rottencoarse: @Towelliee  level up to 20 and that's it
[8:25:42] GRVPHX: only level 20 i think still
[8:25:43] Meddok: man i feel like logging in to wow now but cant since i dont have gametime :(
[8:25:44] yummychickenzz: 1-20 i think
[8:25:52] death_cam_: up to lvl 20 and can access all up to bfa zones i think
[8:25:53] Austei: up to 20 and any content
[8:25:53] PoloDan: They really could just assign entire small studios to help Blizzard out if they wanted
[8:25:54] michaelmm: Level 1-20 only.
[8:25:56] Cosmolus: Idk about that. Microsoft might just bought ActivionBlizzard for diversity investment of their portfolio. Doesn't mean they are going to spend Millions with Blizzard
[8:25:57] TheHardcorian: What changes do you realistically  see coming/possible to wow with this deal? @towe
[8:26:06] Kisswani: it cause of bots ?
[8:26:11] Proxzo: there's a gold cap on trials right>?
[8:26:13] cannacast420: how do you feel that microsoft now owns world of warcraft
[8:26:16] Proxzo: so you can't trial to token?
[8:26:21] Rottencoarse: yup there is a gold cap on trials
[8:26:25] Rottencoarse: and the can not trade
[8:26:32] Tigerklaue: i hope they finish ow2 in the next years
[8:26:33] dynnesty: I'm sad HoTs wasn't bigger
[8:26:33] PumpMasterFlow: I hope the find the time to hire people who can write a good story for WoW
[8:26:36] preiilude: !rwf
[8:26:37] Moobot: @preiilude Who wins? https://strawpoll.com/cz3q7xfco
[8:26:39] Snabido: Snatching cod and their yearly released, easy moneh
[8:26:40] cidthesloth420: trials cant use mail trade and gold cap i think iirc
[8:26:49] spiritowltv: true even Halo aint' close
[8:26:51] Rudric_Ice: WoW will be good now COPIUM
[8:26:52] Folgrum: phil spencer was an internt in microsoft :) after over 30 years he is now CEO of ms gaming. what an amazing career
[8:26:53] Cosmolus: Yeah Blizzard has potential to reach new heights
[8:26:56] TheSabin: Minecraft is huge, but Blizzard games have huge potential
[8:26:59] Shrenko: when is Microsoft buying EA @Towelliee ?
[8:27:01] stryngs_: im so happy
[8:27:05] TheHardcorian: I read an article that supposedly this new deal might break the yearly cod cycle
[8:27:09] yokai_5: @GenTanza it could been bigger but blizzard didn't want to support it more than it is
[8:27:12] ChaoticPriest: or maybe Disney buys Sony. ü§î
[8:27:13] stryngs_: wow could easily make 11 billion a year
[8:27:15] Cosmolus: Microsoft has the whole azure Cloud system
[8:27:28] bonebride: Hold on to ur hats they buy blizzard to kill it so their games get some playtime "TINFOIL HAT"
[8:27:29] piratechris: Investment isn't throwing money and people at a problem. It can be re-structuring and is far more likely to make them more profitable
[8:27:32] Excellerate: i hope Microsoft can make a time machine to make me play WoW like i used to
[8:27:32] iblighters: and wow isn't even in a good spot. Could you imagine the money wow would make if it was in a good spot
[8:27:36] dynnesty: @yokai_5 I like it better than league
[8:27:42] Aidler: finally I will be able to write in Teams to my guild pals in WoW
[8:27:48] raiwist: as long as there aren't jet packs in cod, i'll play it
[8:27:52] Exxcar: Microsoft has enough banked that they can wait for games to be developed
[8:27:54] raiwist: keep that stuff to halo
[8:27:56] TheHardcorian: they are pushing the next cod earlier because vanguard failed so hard....telling times
[8:27:58] yokai_5: @GenTanza i play it everyday for 6 hours with my friends , it is awesome right now .
[8:28:00] Exxcar: They aren't strapped for cash
[8:28:01] Coppermedusa357: Thank god Microsoft bought them, maybe they will turn things around And most importantly FIRE STEVE DANUSER
[8:28:02] Heero_Effect: @aidler that‚Äôs the dream bro
[8:28:03] LadyJasmin: hey i know tot
[8:28:13] DragonofWolves: cod not having annual releases would be godlike. it'll let the game actually evolve
[8:28:13] LadyJasmin: i mean in real life
[8:28:27] TheHardcorian: wow is fine
[8:28:28] iblighters: gameplay wise
[8:28:30] reverbsoul1: Yea, you can not like how they make money...but that doesn't mean they aren't making it.
[8:28:41] cannacast420: i feeel like they will just kill the game and take the advantage of building thier own mmo and people will prob play it since wow would be dead and there would not be a good competitor
[8:28:42] Alaquane: also cod, also candy crush
[8:28:50] r0b928: Just got an email from Factor saying my meals won‚Äôt be delivered today, pretty bummed, didn‚Äôt do my normal meal prep this weekend cause the meals were supposed to be here.
[8:28:55] bonebride: microtransactions inc in WoW via microsoft :D
[8:28:56] Exxcar: @cannacast420 No way at all
[8:28:58] Austei: some people just want see wow die and it keep trucking along
[8:28:59] raiwist: pretty impressive that wow is still so profitable
[8:29:03] Funderik: henry cavill plays wow, nothing more needs saying. Kreygasm

[8:29:50] GRVPHX: yea im gonna get a drink for the rest of this stream lmao
[8:29:50] PumpMasterFlow: Yes, they spent $70 billion to close down all the other games so they are the only one left.
[8:29:52] NippponSteel: Wow is one of the highest grossing games ever.... the thought that MS would spend 80b to kil it is beyond moronic LUL
[8:29:52] Exxcar: The LAST thing they would do is "Hey we spent 70 BILLION to get this MMO.... lets shut it down to spend MILLIONS MORE to make our own"
[8:29:56] PumpMasterFlow: Why didn't I think of that
[8:30:05] NippponSteel: stick to playing wow you dont know how business works.... whoever said that LUL

[8:30:59] Divine_Miscreant: That's all the invites I have until it respawns back on Sentinals/Steemwheedle
[8:31:04] reverbsoul1: Bobby isn't going to take a non-CEO role. No chance in hell he stays.
[8:31:15] KingsandClubs: @pumpmasterflow what about shooters they own the whole market hahaha
[8:31:21] Jindo_ZG: vicarious visions is already melded into blizzard
[8:31:22] Complete_Phased: The real question is if Xbox is actually going to use all the studios that are in the CoD mines or are they just going to keep status quo
[8:31:25] DickyV02: you think they are gonna put wow on the game pass?
[8:31:26] Smag: Microsoft Tony Hawk Simulator
