[4:52:16] praetorianvii: Is WOTK actually objectivly good? if you love the BC era game? I remember true OG classic players (2004-2008) WOTLK was really the end of "classic" era. Does it actually improve the classes and make the game more fun or just changes the balance and add more raid content? More content doesn't really = better, even though long-term MMO players are fooled too think so. Just curious for honest opinions on WOTLK especially if you started in 04-08. I'm not up too date on a general consensus.
[4:53:40] Cidarean: awwww

But after shutdown to put things in, one at the time. Booting and put in another thing and keep on going. Then the loop started again. 😵😵
