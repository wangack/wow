[1:56:45] Exodeo_: Would rather play as Ret
[1:56:51] comedy79: I rerolled from my mage a couple weeks ago to a tank. Taking a while with a full work schedule
[1:56:51] Prideth: i love tanking in bc
[1:56:55] chefjayare: Def not
[1:57:08] Thrixel: I can't tank because internet randomly lags :(
[1:57:10] ThaOriginalGamester: i just started tanking in BFA.. thinking about leveling this pally next
[1:57:12] medanmarko: So if one need Thick Skin, then its best to roll druid? :D
[1:57:15] chefjayare: I tank/heal in retail, I noped my ass straight over to dps for classic
[1:57:19] lithium364: cant wait for back 4 blood
[1:57:26] Kleipd: tanks get shit on in pugs but a lot also just have trouble adjusting to a style where not every single mob needs to be hitting you at all times
[1:57:47] jason_tacey: yes everyone thinks tanks are like retail with aggro being easier to maintain
[1:58:02] bloodwolf: bloodwolf subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 14 months! towRed
[1:58:09] Alepouditsa: yea i try to be a bear tank ones but i got shit about it it was a lvling dungiong to i was like 30 lvl
[1:58:10] Dyez: why wouldn't you?
[1:58:18] Dyez: if its bothering you just forget it
[1:58:22] SsenkradDesruc: so is BC more toxic than retail?
[1:58:30] Thunderbrew: I'm a Druid Tank level 68. I get aggro ripped from my by DPS. Good thing I have a great healer.
[1:58:33] smileMOAR: @jason_tacey I mean a lot of dps also think they are playing retail as well
[1:58:35] Exodeo_: Bc is fine, but with a guild
[1:58:51] jason_tacey: @smileMOAR yes as a Druid tank you are very right
[1:58:52] smileMOAR: They just unload out the gate and threat just doesn't work like that in TBC
[1:58:53] Drostep: When I was 63 I got kicked by a warr tank in bf because he couldn’t hold threat from my dots LUL LUL LUL LUL
[1:58:53] Kinghorn: depends on the server, azuresong is fine toxicity wise
[1:59:01] TrevForSure: as a fury warrior, I always assume I'll be tanking at some point LUL
[1:59:01] Kinghorn: never had an issue
[1:59:16] LosingWithStyle: @SsenkradDesruc It's a learning curve.  Threat is harder to hold and dps need to wait a bit.  Retail isn't the same so its frustrating for tanks.
[1:59:22] StoicTaurus: Yee .. classic community is awful. Haven't seen just an elitist, meta driven mob outside maybe competetive Starcraft xD
[1:59:25] Chiraakitteh: Yeah playing with guildies is usually better than pugs, altho I’ve met a bunch of great folks on this server
[1:59:47] Drostep: Warrs are fine once they get geared our gm is a war tank
[1:59:47] jason_tacey: I had a Spriest the other day, dotting even before a swipe...I let him die
[1:59:51] Chiraakitteh: I think being on a smaller server has helped actually
[1:59:53] 66bankai66: Tank, dps pls wait for rage wait for sunders attack same target and follow the kill order dps.. nah fuk that shit herp derp mode engage dps... this tank is dog shit.. Oof!!!
[2:00:16] CritcobainTV: Like, i understand it's frustrating, but people exaggerate things i think. I've never met a pug that's talked shit. People are just so soft these days Sadge
[2:00:19] CritcobainTV: FeelsBadMan
[2:00:26] Drostep: Man I seen so many retail Andy’s just straight dps before the tank can get threat
[2:00:38] Creampuff1112: TBC is the only expansion that needs CC,not like retail,tank/spank
[2:00:39] Drostep: Like bro wait for the sunders lol
[2:00:49] Drostep: I love tbc
[2:01:03] Chiraakitteh: Lol I just explain that my taunt is 10;sec cooldown and my aoe taunt is 10 min... I think many dps are surprised
[2:01:08] Drostep: Separates the men from the boys lol
[2:01:08] Kinghorn: caaaaw

[2:03:50] Shrenko: whats the issue with pvp ?
[2:03:52] SsenkradDesruc: Imagine if BC had demon hunters
[2:04:00] mr3machine: The pvp issue is kinda player made tho right
[2:04:16] MIKEBRASKA: have they fixed consecrate yet? a few days ago sometimes it would cause 0 threat
[2:04:49] mr3machine: Yeah anything they do (transfers etc) will be met with HUGE backlash
[2:04:53] Lollerask: i thought in arena, you can fight in the same faction?
[2:04:57] Gizimoo86: yeah some people went for the horde because racials etc. and it was known BG queue are bad
[2:04:57] Shrenko: like Venruki
[2:04:58] Creampuff1112: 30 sec que as ally in eots on my server
[2:05:00] jason_tacey: hasn't the honor gained changed over the years though compared from retail to back in TBC
[2:05:08] mr3machine: That really sucks, TBC pvp is fun
[2:05:11] akia03: most farm lowbies in wpvp now
[2:05:13] kenzellbtw: they need to buff alliance racials
[2:05:28] Chiraakitteh: Pvp is cross realm tho isn’t it?
[2:05:32] Oldduketree007: not the racials that are the problem do
[2:05:32] goddammitwalter: players just made this problem. everbody makes horde so they deserve to wait in q tbh
[2:05:37] akia03: @kenzellbtw has nothing to do with racials
[2:05:50] Gizimoo86: buff alliance racials and give faction change for $
[2:06:04] Yagr6: you can never reach your dps potential in BC bc of threat... it bothers me BabyRage
[2:06:07] Oldduketree007: Human for pvp is like good tier with the free trinket
[2:06:10] Kleipd: they "deserve" to wait, kinda of a weird statement but ok
[2:06:10] kenzellbtw: @diathi123 i think all the serious pvpers know horde is better racial wise thats why so many good players are horde. if you buff ally racials it'll equalize
[2:06:19] MIKEBRASKA: @goddammitwalter doesn't matter if it was player made or not, it will become a Blizzard problem once people stop playing
[2:06:55] Chiraakitteh: 'Dps potential' is reached if something dies and you don’t... which usually means the tank held threat
[2:06:56] Moobot: Check out Towelliee's latest Youtube video! https://youtu.be/U8-64zqVa8k Shadowlands needs some help
[2:06:58] Skars111: yea i lost interest  takes 30-60min somtimes just to get a group together for stuff finding tanks and want not too some some servers
[2:07:20] Chiraakitteh: Anything else is just overkill and meter-humping
[2:07:26] MIKEBRASKA: I'd offer free faction changes FROM horde to alliance
[2:07:36] Yagr6: @Chiraakitteh you obviously dont care for parse culture
[2:07:42] smileMOAR: I mean it was always going to happen though
[2:07:45] donpablo_98: towBleedpurple towBleedpurple towBleedpurple towBleedpurple towBleedpurple
[2:07:45] Chiraakitteh: Exactly
[2:07:50] Kleipd: faction change would be the most ideal i think
[2:07:53] Drostep: 40 min queue times on Faerlina for bgs
[2:07:57] smileMOAR: The horde racials were very strong in TBC
[2:08:04] Drostep: Who wants to play alliance tho lmfao
[2:08:15] SlapaH03: just play alliance forsenSmug
[2:08:17] smileMOAR: And even back in TBC it was always heavy horde to alliance ratio
[2:08:21] Gizimoo86: And prepatch honor farming didnt help at all, it did make even more unbalanced
[2:08:26] Scoodles91: the 40 min are the shor ones :D
[2:08:37] Chiraakitteh: Other than being an interesting mathematical problem, parses are meaningless in my opinion
[2:08:44] Cootman314: was  not even on Detheroc lol
[2:08:52] hijinked: People didn't min/max over racials as much back then
[2:08:52] Drostep: Yeah it was even on Cenarius
[2:08:52] Chiraakitteh: Also I hate playing dps, prefer tanking and healing
[2:08:53] Kleipd: parses are fun
[2:09:05] Oldduketree007: they could battle group the pvp so more server can play against each other :P
[2:09:21] Leonin3: racials actually mattered back then tho, they don't really do anything these days
[2:09:31] Kinghorn: the classic andys were in chat in full force last night
[2:09:34] Lollerask: Turn off the meters moon2S
[2:09:35] Creampuff1112: Have you downed any world bosses yet?
[2:09:35] Clicklesly: Wait, i thought they do have battle groups in Classic?
[2:09:37] Kinghorn: I wanted to BOP them all
[2:09:44] Drostep: Lmfao
[2:09:54] MIKEBRASKA: lol super sweaties, have a drink and chill
[2:09:54] Yagr6: u cant parse to your potential bc of threat..  as a retail player it bothers me
[2:10:03] SsenkradDesruc: they should get rid of this restriction imo. Players would be happier if they could fight and wouldn't care whether the opponent is alliance or horde

[3:33:09] ピンドロール: it is a bit of a struggle as a bear tank, i'm saying that as the one healing lol
[3:33:13] Melb1n: send gold and buy it :D
[3:33:13] Cullarr: that looks like my mum walking to the store
[3:33:37] ピンドロール: feel like i have to heal more on my party cuz they don't hold aggro that well
[3:33:41] Cirric_: it does help if you mark a kill order and DPS can follow it and not blast AOE at the start
[3:34:07] rsimpson105: @Towelliee did the epic riding quest with my pally the other night, so glad TBC gives you so much during questing LUL
[3:34:15] CritcobainTV: so anyway i started blastin
[3:34:18] enux337: people need to go burrr
[3:34:20] Cirric_: lol tell me about it
[3:34:41] proellum: Bear tank's best friend is a hunter with misdirect
[3:34:44] Thrixel: DPS numbers go BURRRR
[3:34:46] Dawnyan: Big numbers make my brain go yes
[3:34:57] enux337: or get forced to tank
[3:34:57] SsenkradDesruc: is that epic music the in-game soundtrack?
[3:35:00] bobjones9: m y gold farming was up in skittes killing the elite trees ,av 50-80g a tree worth of herbs back in the day
[3:35:04] Hitmanblood: these tbc dungeons expect Demon hunter kiting levels of skill
[3:35:06] Cirric_: Hunter frost trap and mage blizzard are great for bears
[3:35:13] razma_: they did since lacerate is big
[3:35:35] obabathundae: is that a bc specific xpbar from luxthos ? or its the regular one ?
[3:35:35] Moobot: towRF TBC CLASSIC Limited Edition TOWELLIEE shirts AND Towelliee hats are LIVE! check them out HERE! | Dbh.la/towelliee towRF
[3:35:35] razma_: bear is great once you get lacerate at 66
[3:35:45] CritcobainTV: Pog world first
[3:35:49] Cirric_: lacerate is great threat but still only 1 target at a time
[3:35:53] gazaway: Oh shit the druid's  back! hah
[3:35:55] Kinghorn: free exp EZ
[3:35:57] Sevaar87: no one is ever in front of the portal. there is nothing to do there.
[3:36:05] giantbuckethead: @towelliee yeah at Level 60 it’s rough. But the reason they did is because they increased the scaling of swipe and added Lacerate
[3:36:22] giantbuckethead: Mangle also has a large threat modifier
[3:36:24] FroeyTheMage: @Towelliee as 1,00th person to ask probably: what leveling WA is that?
[3:36:33] TheItalianStallion321: i just transfered over to Mankrik...you gotta see the LFG channel...its endless
[3:36:56] Thrixel: Mankrik LFG channel is unreadable
[3:36:59] diln: diln subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 24 months! Sulfuras is like that too during the evening, its like Asmon's chat
[3:37:02] Dawnyan: xurthos experience bar or something like that @froeythemage
[3:37:04] Sevaar87: ashkandi is almost the same
[3:37:08] diln: awkward sub note lmfao
[3:37:15] Boab: @Thrixel Need the bulletin board addon
[3:37:18] FroeyTheMage: @Dawnyan tyty
[3:37:28] Nerendis: Did you just boost a Druid after having to delete it?
[3:37:29] peinen: thankfully there is a nice addon for LFG now
[3:37:33] Thrixel: @Boab Yea, I picked it up once I saw a video about it
[3:37:52] cavi_XD: that addon is sooooo good
[3:38:27] Thrixel: I think Bulletin Board addon and speedy loot addons are best by far
[3:38:30] mrblond5: Towelliee did u get anything from Grull ?
[3:38:43] Nerendis: Oh shit yeah. They allowed you to restor?
[3:39:04] giantbuckethead: @fnbre Towelliee passes on practically everything.
[3:39:24] Drostep: I’m so glad someone made that lfg  bulletin addon.. the lfg on Faerlina made me dizzy
[3:39:43] Dawnyan: makes sense, can't kill bosses if your tank is getting one shot
[3:39:59] Drostep: Big bear butt LUL
[3:40:26] giantbuckethead: Yeah that’s kind of where I was going. I made out pretty well this week and outside Druid specific pieces there’s not a lot of tanking stuff I need from Kara.

[3:49:10] Chiraakitteh: you don’t get your high threat bleed til 68
[3:49:15] ailoops: Oh you are levelling :D
[3:49:17] Waspire: use it before pull
[3:49:18] Chiraakitteh: Can’t use barkskin in form
[3:49:23] Nerendis: This dungeon was ezpz for me in questing greens @towelliee
[3:49:26] Nerendis: As a bearp
[3:49:29] Nerendis: Bear
[3:49:34] Shrenko: pop barskin before bear form
[3:49:36] Shrenko: its only 1min cd
[3:49:37] binlee11992: as a bear
[3:49:37] tommiegunz: AOE pull start with hurricain
[3:49:43] Chiraakitteh: Use demo roar to reduce enemy attack power
[3:49:47] twistedstick1: but your healer needs to drink. hehe
[3:49:51] tommiegunz: then tab target swipe
[3:50:07] Shrenko: 3
[3:50:10] Nerendis: 6 or 7 I think
[3:50:21] giantbuckethead: Rank 7 is max.
[3:50:21] Shrenko: you wish @HickoryLIVE KEKW
[3:50:31] jason_tacey: throw rejuvie and regrowth then moonfire pul...swipe as much as you can
[3:50:37] Nerendis: He asked about thorns @shrenko Kekkkkk
[3:50:44] Cirric_: Big pull prehot yourself. Pull with MF then go bear. Try to round them up and hit demo roar. Swipe tab swipe tab repeat. Maul if rage is no issue. Mangle is your primary agro builder till you get lacerate. FF as you can
[3:50:46] binlee11992: are hunters good?
[3:50:46] dalaraz: @Towelliee prehot yourself before pulls or you will struggle with aoe threat
[3:50:47] Chiraakitteh: Mangle and mail are your high threat for now
[3:50:59] cruzeal: druid PogChamp towClap
[3:51:05] tommiegunz: AOE taunt is 10min CD
[3:51:13] Gendread77: you have mage to CC lol.
[3:51:18] Chiraakitteh: Also feral faerie fire for target armo reduction
[3:51:18] Moobot: Check out Towelliee's latest Youtube video! https://youtu.be/U8-64zqVa8k Shadowlands needs some help
[3:51:41] Luuin: @Towelliee gotta prehot yourself to help with aoe threat
[3:51:45] ailoops: Train your group to let you go a bit earlier, and pull ahead to build aggro while grp is busy w previous pull
[3:51:46] Shrenko: thought you answered the last question he asked haha @HickoryLIVE
[3:51:52] Kinghorn: bring everyone out I will salv them all on my paladin LUL
[3:52:09] karuzzzzzz: claw timer
[3:52:31] Chiraakitteh: Bear is the equivalent to a 2.5 speed weapon

[3:53:21] bromulos: mangle off cooldown
[3:53:22] Bangpath: oh right bad doggies, i 'member this place
[3:53:25] bromulos: dont waste rage on maul
[3:53:28] bromulos: if youy dont have it
[3:53:31] Chiraakitteh: Also you have two Druids, can hibernate the wolves if needed
[3:53:43] Luuin: @Towelliee preHoT yourself before a pull. helps with aggro
[3:53:51] Cirric_: maul overwrites your base attack so you build no rage with it. If rage  is no issue then go for it
[3:53:55] flyingmachin3: next to cure posion
[3:54:15] Chiraakitteh: Yeah mail is rage dump
[3:54:24] ailoops: faerie fire is a good pulling spell, tiny bit of threat
[3:54:26] dalaraz: @Towelliee you should prehot yourself for extra aoe threat
[3:54:32] Gendread77: what a BE that uses arcnae torrent ha
[3:54:33] Whippedkreme: maul is like heroic strike for warrior

[3:55:07] Kman3107: Yes
[3:55:09] razma_: its asss until 66
[3:55:09] enux337: yep untill you get gear
[3:55:10] DramaticTv: even in retail :P sometimes
[3:55:11] bromulos: Its fantastic single or duo target, 3 or more gets tricky lmao
[3:55:13] jonn_bonn: until lacerate in single target
[3:55:17] dalaraz: sucks aoe yeah
[3:55:21] covalent420: no soda does good
[3:55:23] kenzellbtw: bears are just naturally extremely threatening
[3:55:24] Broseidon7624: bear sucks until lacerate at 66, then its sucks a little less
[3:55:27] WildWilly: yea you played god aoe tank then went bear lol
[3:55:30] tommiegunz: Not really good till 70
[3:55:32] staywokewook: staywokewook subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 6 months! 
[3:55:35] kekelsfloorpov: @towelliee I’m trying to pick a faction in tbc do you know which one would have more hunnies
[3:55:44] Chiraakitteh: Mangle on main target tab to next target when mangle is off cd
[3:55:52] lyeon71: Early bear tanking is like ur PoV ass for days
[3:56:01] Cirric_: bears scale great so you'll be decent for aoe threat by sunwell lol
[3:56:22] gazaway: Ramparts has that insane staff upgrade for ferals, right?
[3:56:27] Cirric_: yeah
[3:56:28] bromulos: Never be able to out aggro a seed of corruption tho ;-(
[3:56:29] Ohnoes11: i used to love bears hp. they had the most out of all tanks
[3:56:36] kekelsfloorpov: Yes ramps has that
[3:56:37] Xilice: Wasn’t there a stacking bleed in TBC you used kinda like sunder?
[3:56:41] Cirric_: dragon boss has a great staff for ferals
[3:57:07] Chiraakitteh: Lacerate  comes later
[3:57:25] clutchmotive: hate how squishy bear tanks are in tbc
[3:57:26] Chiraakitteh: High threat bleed that stacks to 5
[3:57:31] Kman3107: You could activate Enrage while they are drinking. To keep rage from going down for a bit.
[3:57:35] Gendread77: gotta LOS them
[3:57:40] proellum: Dont forget you have charge
[3:58:01] clutchmotive: the last 4 bears ive healed have been super squishy
[3:58:14] Chiraakitteh: Yeah once you get some armor
[3:58:16] clutchmotive: but everyone of them still run Ursol's Claw for some reason
[3:58:24] ailoops: Bears are biggest HP/AC tanks in tbc. But gearing is crucial
[3:58:38] ailoops: armor
[3:58:45] ailoops: Yeh
[3:59:01] Shrenko: alot of butt clenching
[3:59:03] Cirric_: yeah thats why you never see bears tanking in pugs. Almost all are pallies
[3:59:08] Gendread77: youll be great at boss tanking
[3:59:09] clutchmotive: they have great HP but i havent found one that knows how to hold aggro and doesnt lose half their health bar before i get a lesser healing wave
[3:59:26] Wulfgrym: @Towelliee bears can't reach uncrushable or nearly impossible to get uncrushable
[3:59:28] clutchmotive: im a resto shammy. shouldnt have issues lol
[3:59:37] PokerFaceMoose: ive healed 4x more bear tanks than any other tank
[3:59:45] backpackax: towSO towSO towSO
[3:59:56] Chiraakitteh: Bears need to get their debuff out for melee damage and get lots of armor
[3:59:57] Bangpath: lot more mobs in BC though
[4:00:30] Cirric_: "Agro on nothing."  Thats bear tanking in a nutshell
[4:01:24] razma_: its same thing as warrior over 3 - 4 mobs you cant do anything if you have a mage or a lock
[4:01:24] Moobot: Check out Towelliee's latest Youtube video! https://youtu.be/U8-64zqVa8k Shadowlands needs some help
[4:01:33] Whippedkreme: It is like warrior, you gotta change targets a lot
[4:01:38] jason_tacey: they did
[4:01:42] Cirric_: Yep warriors have similar aoe threat issues
[4:01:45] Kinghorn: they took the threat modifier off maul
[4:01:52] jason_tacey: Druid aggro is so messed up
[4:01:53] Chiraakitteh: At lvl 60 I have almost 60% onus damage reduction
[4:01:54] otisr3dding: dont forget to activate righteous furry
[4:01:54] Kinghorn: and it is on lacerate now
[4:01:56] ailoops: DO you have threat talents?
[4:01:58] Sarole: @Towelliee did you boost a druid ?
[4:01:58] Broseidon7624: they did, spam swipe just doesnt hold agro anymore
[4:01:59] Hitmanblood: Bear is really good with some more gear that armor though
[4:02:00] SonofHorus82: hey cool did they finally unlock your druid?
[4:02:21] ailoops: I assume he does have threat talents ofc
[4:02:28] verm1111: what happened before with the druid?
[4:03:06] Luuin: at least at 66 you get lacerate, i think... been awhile.

[4:03:44] Chiraakitteh: Had to wait a month to get the toon back
[4:03:58] TheItalianStallion321: make a mouseover macro for lacerate
[4:04:18] therealdemps: what is the cd for character transfer?
[4:04:35] TheItalianStallion321: @therealdemps literally like 5 minutes
[4:04:42] loki2k20: modern wow makes tanking harder for classic because when tbc first came out.  Every player knew to plan out each pull with cc and waiting for the healers mana. Most players nowadays just want to rush through the dungeon
[4:04:59] devoted_bee: Imagine parrying while being mauled by a bear
[4:05:03] therealdemps: @TheItalianStallion321 nah i transfered before tbc and it says im still on cd
[4:05:13] TheItalianStallion321: @therealdemps oh...that i dont know. sorry

[4:52:45] aesirsghost: Yeah
[4:52:45] Sathalan: yes
[4:52:46] fuzzbucket: yea
[4:52:47] WhiteKnight74648: Thats it
[4:52:48] kharditv: YES THATS HIM
[4:52:48] LMAOBRUHLOLXD: yezzir
[4:52:49] tezrelli: mjeap
[4:52:50] Kinghorn: onward!
[4:52:50] aesirsghost: thats it, wiki must be wrong
[4:52:51] winglypanda: yeap
[4:53:03] WhiteKnight74648: We did it chat!
[4:53:04] Helliebabe: @aesirsghost it's not wrong, those are his completed quests

[4:53:17] AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA: Pog
[4:53:20] Kinghorn: hes done it
[4:53:28] aesirsghost: Nah, I'm looking at the Wiki and it says you start this one in Eulmore @Helliebabe
[4:53:31] Helliebabe: 4 more
[4:53:35] kharditv: 4 more
[4:53:35] zackyton: theres 5 total quests im fairly certain
[4:53:38] nach0picante: 4 more including this one
[4:53:38] xristakios: 4 more
[4:53:40] Helliebabe: @aesirsghost he never goes to eulmore,
[4:53:46] WhiteKnight74648: @Towelliee in case you forgot this quest line tells the story of one of Arberts companinons
[4:53:55] winglypanda: lvl 80 is last, if you do all job class quests you get a special questline
[4:54:06] Helliebabe: @aesirsghost Kholusia (X:16.5, Y:28.4) is what it says
[4:54:07] WhiteKnight74648: @Towelliee this is the story of their tank
[4:54:08] aesirsghost: Right. I think it means Kholusia but  is wrong on the Wiki.
[4:54:29] Helliebabe: Ranged DPS goes to eulmore, u might be looking at the wrong one
[4:54:37] jesireden1984: how od you like this game3 so far
[4:54:40] jesireden1984: Towelliee
[4:54:58] Fogboundtuna: should I enjoy the MSQ or just power through to get to end game like wow? lol
[4:55:06] aesirsghost: It says Defind By Loss and says speak to Granson. Its just a mistype.
[4:55:09] Sathalan: coxNod
[4:55:09] NovaSun84: nodders
[4:55:13] WolfieWunderlich: Enjoy the MSQ @Fogboundtuna
[4:55:21] CostanzatheMage: /nod
[4:55:31] kharditv: @Fogboundtuna its a casual based game
[4:55:34] Fogboundtuna: @WolfieWunderlich sweet! ty!
[4:55:37] Chizum: is there pvp in FF?
[4:55:38] nach0picante: @Fogboundtuna end game is gated behind the MSQ, so you would need to complete it. but it's good so take your time and enjoy it
[4:55:39] NovaSun84: nodders
[4:56:10] Helliebabe: @Chizum yesz
[4:56:11] Kisswani: Hi Chat towHi
[4:56:48] xristakios: @fogboundtuna if you don't care about the story maybe you should buy boost
[4:56:58] Helliebabe: Dont boost
[4:57:08] Helliebabe: If u dont know what ur doing and you boost, people get mad
[4:57:13] WhiteKnight74648: Strip club

[4:57:33] Helliebabe: @xristakios this isnt wow
[4:57:34] WolfieWunderlich: FF14 is mostly story driven and the MSQ gives you almost all the exp you need to get to 80.
[4:57:39] Kantern: There actually is. but you probably dont have it
[4:57:40] Broomba: @Fogboundtuna i would recommend not to boost
[4:57:44] Helliebabe: There is a throw money emote
[4:57:47] SPAZnHD: actually yes
[4:57:49] remixonfire91: you have a coin shower emote @Towelliee

[4:58:37] Kisswani: oh he's doing his role quest . these were great

[4:58:47] shino_thesinner: Welcome back
[4:58:49] WhiteKnight74648: @Fogboundtuna what is your playstyle
[4:58:50] Helliebabe: Even if you have played wow, i have played with a lot of ex wow players and they are completely different games.
[4:58:58] Helliebabe: (dont boost) xD
[4:58:59] Broomba: @Fogboundtuna u can play all classes on 1 toon
[4:59:05] Elwhappo: CoolCat

[4:59:09] Fogboundtuna: @WhiteKnight74648 druid boomkin main
[4:59:14] Helliebabe: @Fogboundtuna what is druid like on WoW?
[4:59:16] kharditv: @Fogboundtuna there is no drood in FF 14 DansGame
[4:59:16] WolfieWunderlich: All the classes are fine to start with, some classes you only unlock later. Just try as many as you want and find one you like.
[4:59:19] remixonfire91: @Fogboundtuna  play black mage
[4:59:42] Helliebabe: yup
[4:59:44] ClockworkZen: @Fogboundtuna As a druid main myself, I went with arcanist. Lots of dots, a self heal, and rez ability.
[4:59:47] Helliebabe: blue ones
[4:59:48] Fogboundtuna: all on one? wtf did i get into hahaha
[5:00:06] WSeveryn: So was looking to buy Dark Alliance because it looks cool, opened up Game Pass and it's there.. so cool.
[5:00:08] Fogboundtuna: @ClockworkZen oh snap! ty!
[5:00:12] Helliebabe: At least u dont have to level multiple classes to get ONE job anymore xD
[5:00:18] WhiteKnight74648: @Fogboundtuna if you are looking for casters i recommend Thaumaturge or Arcanist
[5:00:51] WhiteKnight74648: however you can switch your job in the game. one character plays all the jobs
[5:01:03] Fogboundtuna: i kind of want to switch it up and tank lmao screw it
[5:01:11] WhiteKnight74648: any tank is good
[5:01:26] Helliebabe: @Fogboundtuna yup, 100% never boost a tank. Never goes well xD Good luck tanking! it's fun

[5:05:07] SsenkradDesruc: some of those textures look so bad, even though the game looks kinda good
[5:05:14] Keffezx: I didn't say he did it lol
[5:05:24] Klefth: That was the PLD in Arbert's party a hundred years ago
[5:05:26] Kisswani: he's just one of Ardbert's dudes

[5:06:02] Tickwick: I lost the plot in this game when spaceship and space troopers got involved
[5:06:03] lyra_ven: how convinient xD
[5:06:04] kharditv: @Fogboundtuna you play what you want to play
[5:06:21] Bruzzi: Dude imo this is the best mmo, Ive been enjoying the crap out of it lately

[5:09:46] Coleyne: ohh what game is this?
[5:09:47] kharditv: i mean Dans Game
[5:09:54] Kisswani: danKappa does this one count @kharditv ?
[5:10:03] kharditv: #
[5:10:09] kharditv: @Kisswani I ALLOW IT
[5:10:09] WhiteKnight74648: yep
[5:10:12] Radrez: yep
[5:10:13] Kisswani: yeah
[5:10:19] Reap14: You need to finish this questline before you go on with msq
[5:10:19] Radrez: only couple more quests
[5:10:52] crikit_: wow toweliee too
[5:11:01] MofuLord: mord soup
[5:11:04] crikit_: what is it that im just not getting about xiv
[5:11:28] celeran1: yo guys ever try to smoke gysahl greens
[5:11:29] Sathalan: because the main enemies are called sin eaters, and they eat people's life energy, meaning the people they eat must be sinners (I guess)
[5:11:37] ClockworkZen: @rikety_crikit I dunno, where do you bounce off of it?
[5:11:46] MofuLord: @rikety_crikit ask a more specific question, im not sure how to answer lol
[5:12:25] crikit_: idk i just lose intrest quickly, everyone always says you gotta read the msq you gotta pay attn but it is difficult for me to do lol
[5:12:42] loki2k20: is final fantasy casual friendly?
[5:12:49] Reap14: It could be that it just isn't a good fit for you @rikety_crikit
[5:12:50] Tickwick: is super casual
[5:13:02] kharditv: @loki2k20 very
[5:13:08] smrtihlav1985: do you need to pay monthly sub fee?
[5:13:12] TheSupas: @rikety_crikit If you have trouble reading MSQ, the story itself would be lost on you, so it might not be a good fit.  :)
[5:13:26] crikit_: it looks super cool but i just cant get through the leveling process to do the cool stuff
[5:13:29] kharditv: @smrtihlav1985 there a free trial to 60 if you like it then yes you have to pay
[5:13:41] ClockworkZen: it's super casual friendly, but it's also very story heavy. If you don't enjoy cutscenes and dialogue with an extended cast, you might not appreciate the game's biggest strength
[5:13:45] TheSupas: Bye bye @skypunch28
[5:13:48] DeePhan: will u be unlocking the normal raids?
[5:13:51] nonstopdisco: damn that looked good lol
[5:13:55] MereZulu: Lol same setup as in wow @Towelliee
[5:13:57] Xiaopewpew: this guy s like your exact replica wow nice character customisation lol
[5:14:03] TheSupas: \o/
[5:14:04] Broomba: @skypunch28 cool story bro
[5:14:11] llExpert: did u try iQos
[5:14:12] Reap14: Some people do play the game for raiding alone but most don't
[5:14:13] smrtihlav1985: how is map? is it big? Can you show map?
[5:14:19] slitherybuffelo12: is this game free to play?
[5:14:28] darkuro: no sub
[5:14:29] TheSupas: You can size your map however mig or small you want it @smrtihlav1985
[5:14:30] DeePhan: oh man that crunch
[5:14:35] MereZulu: Hows this game on a scale of 1-10
[5:14:37] TheSupas: big*
[5:14:48] WolfieWunderlich: The free trial has the base game + first expac as f2p, but the last 2 expacs are sub based
[5:14:49] Broomba: i dont get the reaction many are having about ff14 and the hype when its been out since 2014
[5:14:55] Nathanisms: That toast looking a bit well done
[5:15:10] AmalJedusor: because expansions are getting better and better @Broomba
[5:15:11] Reap14: @Broomba The game keeps getting better. They consistently improve it.
[5:15:19] epicyetie: epicyetie subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 11 months! 
[5:15:19] nonstopdisco: who eats toast any other way besides well done? haha
[5:15:27] kharditv: ban hammer inc LUL
[5:15:31] WhiteKnight74648: @Cerealkillas UwU
[5:15:33] Tickwick: my best advice is play this game as an rpg first and mmo second, there's no rush to endgame like in wow
[5:15:41] Broomba: @Reap14 i know i have been playing since ARR thanks to towelliee and have been subbed since 2014 and have all expansions
[5:15:41] Radrez: @Broomba I could say the same thing about WoW
[5:15:58] llExpert: @Tickwick exactly
[5:16:19] Broomba: some people and streamers are afraid to play different games other than wow thats why i like towelliee he plays a variety of games
[5:16:24] WhiteKnight74648: The Meta of FF XIV is to enjoy it
[5:16:59] DeePhan: well we do get tomes helping clearing progression

[5:17:07] Sathalan: there's new game plus so if you ever feel like going through the story after skipping, you can do that eogYup
[5:17:13] Nathanisms: I skipped my own journey because I watched all the cutscenes via streams so I just didnt wanna replay it all

[6:00:44] zackyton: yeah u got the deeps
[6:00:47] gwynegaming: you were breaking your combos, the skills in the instance are a combo chain, you dont press 1 then 2, continuosly pressing 1 = single target combo, and pressing 2 = is AoE combo.

[6:08:09] Radrez: @Towelliee they used those crystals to invade eorzea in 2.X patch if you can remember the questline :)
[6:08:14] metavahn231: why have you quit the world of warcraft PepeHands tell me
[6:08:43] TSGJamesR: :C

[6:09:17] WolfieWunderlich: Part of the MSQ
[6:09:25] TSGJamesR: That was one of the "FeelsBringersMan" moments I had when I did the Tank quests. towCry
[6:09:30] Kisswani: yeah because you fight bug sword dude

[6:11:40] WhiteKnight74648: this should be the last quest
[6:11:44] TSGJamesR: That's the last Tank Role Quest, ye.
[6:11:47] Radrez: you get all 3
[6:11:48] TSGJamesR: Not for PLD.
[6:11:49] modifiedzohar: nah just stack crit
[6:11:51] Bl4z31n: no
[6:11:59] ToBais91: and pizza was a food some point this expac
[6:11:59] jackthewolf434: it's "supposed to be tank stat" but it sucks, you're better off getting crit
[6:12:00] Bl4z31n: tenacity isn't very good
[6:12:00] metavahn231: this game is all about the dps meta, even for tanks and healers
[6:12:10] TSGJamesR: Tenacity actually sucks for PLD. You're better with Crit and Direct Hit.
[6:12:27] Crusader226: Nope. Crit, DIrect Hit, and Determination usually out weigh Tenacity
[6:12:46] Tofutoshi: stats need a rebalance, most just stack crit+DH
[6:12:58] jackthewolf434: stat squish in 6.0 will be interesting
[6:13:01] Crusader226: Yep
[6:13:05] cbiskit89: salted xiv has skill speed ahead of direct hit for PLD. is that wrong? https://saltedxiv.com/pld
[6:13:13] hopelesssorrow: @towelliee what is that pod system bro
[6:13:21] comato4st: gear hasn't meant anything in this game since they removed accuracy
[6:13:25] TSGJamesR: @cbiskit89 Honestly, I can see that. SkS is what I use in my GNB built at the moment.
[6:13:31] Tofutoshi: you only need a skill speed threshhold

[6:14:13] ToBais91: it's his job though
[6:14:19] Kineticbomb: I think you also have a consider itemlevel. Certain stats are better until you reach a level where the other overtakes the number 1 spot for stats.
[6:14:24] Keffezx: He's a Dark knight, it's kinda in the job description
[6:14:40] Crusader226: @Kineticbomb That is true as well.

[6:22:29] ToBais91: things resolve at different times
[6:22:36] comato4st: @bino_ i just leveled a new character to 80 and it took me 5 days skipping all but the important cutscenes i havent seen

[6:23:21] Vexxsis: yyes
[6:23:40] comato4st: @bino_ you can play til 60 for free with no time limit

[6:24:02] bino_: @comato4st oh wow that seems new. Im sure that im limited on what I can do though correct?
[6:24:06] Crusader226: Yeah FF14's F2P is insane
[6:24:11] comato4st: @bino_ no you can do everything
[6:24:24] zenryuuken: it's just social features
[6:24:34] D0gz1: FF14, content is free up to the end of first xpac. The usual talk, trade, Free company (guilds) limitations.
[6:24:37] comato4st: @bino_ I would do that and wait until closer to enwalker when all content is included for the price of the expac
[6:24:39] MofuLord: @bino_ cant use the auction house, but thats the only big one
[6:24:40] Creakydoors: OMEGALUL

[6:26:18] Helliebabe: My ex had to get his old account back, took 2 days
[6:26:39] bino_: @Helliebabe so I must have made some one off email for my account and I cant remember it. Put in a ticket and it was them just telling me to resend my info. Was pretty frustrating. I even screenshot my character and what realm it was on.

[6:31:13] Klefth: As long as you do the MSQ and some roulettes, you don't need trash quests or grinding
[6:31:16] WolfieWunderlich: It's like 90-100% main story for your first class. You might have to do a leveling dungeon here and there but MSQ is most of the XP to max level
[6:31:24] FreeMont: @Ven277 ah ok thx xD
[6:31:32] Kineticbomb: Quests with a golden/blue symbol unlocks content and fiery goden symbol is main quest. Everything else can be ignored if you want.

[6:35:33] comato4st: @FreeMont crafting is really good in this game but there's a lot of depth to it, you're better off coming back to crafting after the story rather than doing it as you go, but to each their own.

[6:39:16] AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA: 1.5m
[6:39:16] pdghaschel: couple million gil?
[6:39:16] Soxzors1: gew mil
[6:39:17] comato4st: like 2-3 mill
[6:39:17] DawnsRoyal: savage gear is 530, so you can tackel all content with this
[6:39:19] myllianna: about 1.5mil
[6:39:19] Eludi: 2-3m
[6:39:19] TSGJamesR: Millions
[6:39:20] ravn_sensei: couple mil
[6:39:20] Kisswani: 2.5 mil
[6:39:20] Klefth: Like million and half

[6:39:24] myllaena: about 1.3 mil

[6:39:28] happybooger: all of the Gil
[6:39:29] Klefth: 1.5mil about
[6:39:34] vocalpenguin: what level can you start doing dungeons? and can you level by dungeons like wow?
[6:39:35] Ski751: A little over or under a million I might say, it depends on server

[6:39:35] Oiranaru: Depends on the server economy, to be fair.
[6:39:39] Wrenton: but why that 520 version? you cant pentameld that version?
[6:39:39] Elyseums: more than all my gil LOL
[6:39:41] nathrizen: zadnor 525 gear
[6:39:41] KatteBlack: If they had all the mats, it was free. :3
[6:39:42] Shinjuro: getting a house would be the next big thing Kappa
[6:39:42] Mayzyne: Its not that expensive on Gilga anymore guys, that full set is like 1.5m at most now
[6:39:43] xPEPPERSx: Around 2mil depend on server
[6:39:52] comato4st: @Mayzyne maybe on your server
[6:40:02] Klefth: If you craft, that's nothing. There's nothing to spend gil in the game lol
[6:40:04] Mayzyne: I'm on the same server as him comato4st
[6:40:05] DawnsRoyal: @vocalpenguin 16 is the first, you can lvl through dungeons, but on your first job you can get max just by doing main story, and you have to do all of main story in this game
[6:40:25] ToBais91: story locks content like dungeons, etc
[6:40:33] Mayzyne: And I sell exarchis gear fairly often when I'm bored ;..;
[6:40:44] vocalpenguin: @DawnsRoyal in other words i would have to complete the main story regardless?
[6:40:46] comato4st: @Mayzyne not everyone in chat responding is on gilgamesh though
[6:40:50] Oiranaru: You need to beat 5.0 for the first two tiers of the raid and 5.3 for the final tier, ya.
[6:40:51] DawnsRoyal: @vocalpenguin correct
[6:40:57] Elyseums: every server has different prices
[6:40:58] Klefth: Now you can get the artifact/glam set for lvl 80 PLD too
[6:41:01] AzusaBae: how long will you be streaming today ?
[6:41:04] vocalpenguin: @DawnsRoyal ty :)
[6:41:08] Mayzyne: Which is why I said that its not the expensive on GILGA
[6:41:09] NezeruGaming: Could resize the textbox to make it bigger for stream.
[6:41:13] xPEPPERSx: Min ilvl for savage right now is 510
[6:41:19] Vexxsis: lol
[6:41:24] Elyseums: the level 80 artifact set for PLD looks amazing
[6:41:25] KatteBlack: Aether DC is way less expensive than other DCs.
[6:41:31] DekeZander: vocalpenguin once you go through MSQ once you can dungeon spam to level alt classes
[6:41:39] KatteBlack: The gear isn't that big of a cost for where he is at.
[6:41:39] Wrenton: yup
[6:41:40] Vexxsis: yup
[6:41:41] pdghaschel: yes
[6:41:41] Archoverious: Yes
[6:41:41] Oiranaru: Yep.
[6:41:41] Kisswani: yep
[6:41:43] baitisnicem8: Yes
[6:41:45] TSGJamesR: Yea
[6:41:46] AnnaBanana: I make about 200k on pieces of exarchic gear on Ultros
[6:41:46] vocalpenguin: @DekeZander gotcha
[6:41:50] Kineticbomb: don't forget to repair
[6:41:51] KatteBlack: Aether is land of the massive under cutters. xD
[6:41:52] Klefth: Yes, and you get sweet looking shit
[6:41:57] zackyton: yep
[6:42:03] zackyton: theres like 2 hours left of msq
[6:42:04] zackyton: iirc
[6:42:09] Mayzyne: It really is KaterinaNoire xD
[6:42:14] ToBais91: just got new gear, don't need to repair
[6:42:14] pdghaschel: its kind of a damn shame that you got that full crafted set, the paladin armor set for shadowbringers looks pretty dope
[6:42:14] KatteBlack: Lmao
[6:42:14] myllianna: Some skill speed as well
[6:42:15] Ryenonn: How do you turn off the tooltip in FFXIV or maybe move it out of the way
[6:42:23] Oiranaru: Speak to Grenoldt again after beating this quest to see the level 80 artifact armour you can now get @Towelliee .
[6:42:27] AnnaBanana: exar kick
[6:42:28] Kisswani: and probably one of the best moment in any MMO ever . I love this part of Shadowbringers
[6:42:29] MofuLord: ex-arc-ic
[6:42:30] myllaena: its a crafted set
[6:42:31] Elyseums: exactly
[6:42:37] myllaena: no set bonuses
[6:42:38] kathyrinanorvell: no
[6:42:39] Oiranaru: No set bonuses.
[6:42:40] ravn_sensei: nah
[6:42:40] xPEPPERSx: Healers and tank stat toward more dmg to try and push raid fights faster @towelliee
[6:42:40] KatteBlack: Ye, that is crafted.
[6:42:40] TSGJamesR: No set bonuses.
[6:42:41] Sanctitas: no set bonuses nope
[6:42:41] comato4st: nah gear is pretty barebones in this game
[6:42:44] DawnsRoyal: no set bonuses in this game
[6:42:45] Elyseums: you can mix any piece with others
[6:42:47] Oiranaru: Nope.
[6:42:47] myllaena: not really
[6:42:48] baitisnicem8: No
[6:42:49] ravn_sensei: nah not really
[6:42:49] Klefth: No set bonuses, it's just the latest crafted gear
[6:42:50] pdghaschel: no
[6:42:51] Helliebabe: No
[6:42:53] 갓스팀: I believe there's no set bonuses at all
[6:42:53] Moobot: Check out Towelliee's latest Youtube video! https://youtu.be/U8-64zqVa8k Shadowlands needs some help
[6:42:54] Qwertys_TV: nop
[6:42:55] ToBais91: not at end game
[6:42:57] TSGJamesR: @Towelliee There are, but for crafters and gatherers.
[6:42:58] KatteBlack: No set bonus. Our BIS set ups are mix and matches of raid and tome gear.
[6:43:00] Elyseums: always aim for the best ilvl and stats
[6:43:03] Vexxsis: tbh i wish they would do
[6:43:08] DawnsRoyal: there are some set bonuses for super low lvl grand company gear, but those really don't matter
[6:43:08] Zenobuis: You can over meld it
[6:43:08] Ski751: For someee things yes, like  the level 70/80 crafters right side
[6:43:09] Klefth: Savage
[6:43:09] baitisnicem8: Yes
[6:43:09] Kineticbomb: Everything savage
[6:43:10] JinTackle: everything
[6:43:10] Elyseums: yes
[6:43:11] TSGJamesR: Yes.
[6:43:11] AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA: most end game content
[6:43:12] Sanctitas: basically everything
[6:43:12] DawnsRoyal: everything
[6:43:12] kathyrinanorvell: there is but its pretty minor stuff
[6:43:12] SingingDune: Yes first one
[6:43:15] WhiteKnight74648: Everything
[6:43:17] xristakios: easily
[6:43:17] DiminutiveSnowman: everything
[6:43:19] TSGJamesR: All the things.
[6:43:19] Oiranaru: You can tank everything in the game at this point @Towelliee .
[6:43:19] baitisnicem8: You can do all the Savage raids fine
[6:43:20] ToBais91: I've seen a minor one on gc gear, but that is all
[6:43:20] AnnaBanana: just the first one
[6:43:21] Qwertys_TV: Every raid
[6:43:23] ravn_sensei: should be good for e9S-10s
[6:43:24] pdghaschel: ultimate
[6:43:24] JinTackle: ultimate needs specific gear
[6:43:25] AnnaBanana: No chat LOL
[6:43:25] ToBais91: ultimate
[6:43:25] Elyseums: E9S and E10S for sure
[6:43:26] myllaena: Ultimate
[6:43:26] Helliebabe: Ultimate
[6:43:28] Radrez: ultimate
[6:43:29] KatteBlack: You can do technically all with it, but it's gonna hurt.
[6:43:29] Klefth: Ultimate, but Ultimate is always at a set item level
[6:43:30] TSGJamesR: Ultimate, but it's synced down.
[6:43:31] modifiedzohar: Ultimate, but only one came out this expansion @Towelliee
[6:43:33] Ziegmar: Ultimate
[6:43:34] SPAZnHD: u can tank pretty much everything
[6:43:34] WhiteKnight74648: Ultimate but no rewards other then cosemtics
[6:43:35] Oiranaru: Ultimate is the tier above Savage.
[6:43:36] nathrizen: Ultimate is harder than mythic raiding
[6:43:37] KatteBlack: There are Ultimates, but no new one for this tier.
[6:43:38] Radrez: ultimate but nobody can tank that :P
[6:43:38] SingingDune: Ultimate>Savage>Extreme trials
[6:43:39] DawnsRoyal: ultimate, but those are capped to rather low ilvl
[6:43:41] Elyseums: Ultimate never gets easier
[6:43:45] Helliebabe: And there's raids with 56 and 48 people. 1 is hard and the 48man is savage
[6:43:46] Elyseums: sync down
[6:43:52] baitisnicem8: There is four raids of Savage that require high end gear, Ultimate less ilvl because its older content
[6:44:01] metavahn231: ultimate is a seperate thing from savage
[6:44:01] Moobot: towRF TBC CLASSIC Limited Edition TOWELLIEE shirts AND Towelliee hats are LIVE! check them out HERE! | Dbh.la/towelliee towRF
[6:44:02] 0x10f2c: Yeah
[6:44:03] FroeyTheMage: Think of Ultimate as Mage Tower
[6:44:03] KatteBlack: Ultimate does get easier. better gear melts the fights.
[6:44:03] Archoverious: Basically
[6:44:04] myllaena: basically
[6:44:04] pdghaschel: yes
[6:44:05] Kisswani: kinda
[6:44:06] AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA: yes
[6:44:06] JinTackle: yes
[6:44:06] Elyseums: you should start with Extreme Trials
[6:44:07] ToBais91: kinda yeah
[6:44:08] TSGJamesR: Yes, on steroids.
[6:44:09] Oiranaru: Ultimate is completely different to Savage though. They're super long singular fights that are 'what-if' scenarios from the story and are separate from raids @Towelliee .
[6:44:09] Klefth: Basically you CAN'T overlevel Ultimates at all
[6:44:14] Kineticbomb: The game does it for oyu
[6:44:15] PlaguedV: syncs down
[6:44:15] baitisnicem8: Its synced down
[6:44:18] pdghaschel: auto syncs down yea
[6:44:18] C4ptainblack: yes
[6:44:18] TSGJamesR: Yea.
[6:44:18] Elyseums: yes
[6:44:18] Radrez: yep
[6:44:20] myllaena: nah there is a BiS list for ultimate
[6:44:21] AnnaBanana: You get a title and fancy gear
[6:44:23] ravn_sensei: gear scales but there is BiS for Ultimates
[6:44:25] Elyseums: but of coure you need the BiS
[6:44:25] Archoverious: Your stats get synced, so you can optimise it
[6:44:27] metavahn231: alot of endgame content is synced
[6:44:28] AnnaBanana: Fancy weapons*
[6:44:31] baitisnicem8: Yes
[6:44:31] JinTackle: if you do ultimate with i510 you will lose materia melds
[6:44:32] Kineticbomb: Yes
[6:44:32] DekeZander: right
[6:44:33] Wolferey: you can't wear low level, it doesnt sync up, but you can wear higher, it syncs down
[6:44:33] Klefth: Yes
[6:44:33] sinderfell: Ultimate would be Algalon if he head a phase for each of the wing bosses before fighting him
[6:44:35] Helliebabe: yup
[6:44:36] SingingDune: yes
[6:44:36] KatteBlack: It with level sync stats and secondaries will either go up or max with higher ilvl gear.
[6:44:38] DiminutiveSnowman: yerp
[6:44:38] DawnsRoyal: there are optimizations you can do for ultimate to min max some stats
[6:44:38] JinTackle: because of melds
[6:44:39] kathyrinanorvell: stats
[6:44:39] DekeZander: because of materia melds
[6:44:40] Tofutoshi: substats
[6:44:40] myllaena: stats optimization
[6:44:41] pdghaschel: because of how the stats work
[6:44:41] Helliebabe: But u can still get BiS for it.
[6:44:42] Vexxsis: melds
[6:44:42] PlaguedV: because u can optimize ur stats
[6:44:42] xPEPPERSx: Ultimate give u a title and glamour wpn doesn’t offer upgrades @towelliee
[6:44:43] ToBais91: it's hard af
[6:44:46] Wrenton: you will lose Materis melds
[6:44:47] TSGJamesR: @Towelliee There's gear at that iLvl it syncs down to.
[6:44:47] baitisnicem8: For one of them BiS is better for stats
[6:44:47] AnnaBanana: Because it is a difficult encounter
[6:44:48] Klefth: Because min-maxing
[6:44:48] SingingDune: Materia min max
[6:44:49] JinTackle: synced down gear loses materia melds
[6:44:50] KatteBlack: Bis matters cause of sub stats.
[6:44:51] Sanctitas: there are certainl bis items - you don't benetfit from melded materia in synced down gear
[6:44:51] Morfus13God: syncing down removes the materia bonuses
[6:44:52] NellanaMaethor: you can optimize your sub stats
[6:44:52] TSGJamesR: It's all about min-maxing.
[6:44:55] Elyseums: Towel start with a Extreme Primal
[6:44:55] Oiranaru: Syncing down nullifies materia melds.
[6:44:56] modifiedzohar: @Towelliee bis only matters really for the ultimate released this expansion (the previous two) doesn't matter
[6:44:56] Bl4z31n: its min maxing with substats
[6:44:56] AnnaBanana: You want the most optimal stats
[6:44:58] nathrizen: Towelliee needs to do Savage Delibrum Reginae 48 man raid I think he'll love it
[6:44:59] P1ght: stats still matter
[6:45:03] DekeZander: Ultimate is for bragging rights
[6:45:06] Wolferey: ultimate is basically doing hardest mechanics for bragging rights
[6:45:07] Tofutoshi: yes
[6:45:07] Wrenton: yup
[6:45:07] TerrellDean: Correct
[6:45:08] baitisnicem8: Yes
[6:45:08] Vexxsis: right
[6:45:08] ToBais91: 8 man mage tower basically
[6:45:09] Soxzors1: its for flex
[6:45:09] Klefth: No, just a title and a shiny weapon
[6:45:10] NezeruGaming: Pure prestige
[6:45:12] JinTackle: bragging rights pretty much

[6:45:19] Qwertys_TV: It gives you prestige
[6:45:19] KatteBlack: It is a gear upgrade if the content is relevant.
[6:45:19] TSGJamesR: Yes, bragging/flexing rights.
[6:45:20] Vexxsis: yes
[6:45:21] Charlieboy808: it's all about that Flex lol

[6:45:22] Bl4z31n: it has 3 materia slots
[6:45:22] DekeZander: yeah it's like a super hard mage tower
[6:45:23] Elyseums: Ultimate is damn hard
[6:45:23] DiminutiveSnowman: bragging rights yeah
[6:45:23] Wolferey: yep
[6:45:25] Klefth: Ya
[6:45:25] Venjik: yes
[6:45:25] AnnaBanana: You get one totem per clear you can exchange for any ultimate weapon
[6:45:25] Shrenko: thats awesome
[6:45:26] Xylanyia: well mage tower was really easy compared
[6:45:29] Helliebabe: people buy clears now so it's not that impressive xD
[6:45:33] tachankus: so so so much harder than mage tower lol
[6:45:37] comato4st: Yeah its a "mage tower" raid
[6:45:38] Wrenton: compared to Mage, Mage is Easy
[6:45:41] DawnsRoyal: ultimates are also just extremly difficult like 18 minute long fights
[6:45:43] kathyrinanorvell: bajFlex
[6:45:46] Ryenonn: Glamour is FFXIV end game content ?
[6:45:47] redbulladin: are u enjoying final fantasy?

[6:46:10] nathrizen: the ultimate of the sweat
[6:46:10] Jigy_LB: @Towelliee Yes, the reward is similar to the rewards from Mage tower. But the fights themselves you could think of fighting like Professor P, Sindragosa, & LK at the same time.
[6:46:11] DawnsRoyal: extreme trials also offer a new good weapon whenever they come out
[6:46:13] AnnaBanana: They just added relic weapons where some are currently more bis than savage weapons
[6:46:15] JinTackle: you can upgrade your current gear to i520 too
[6:46:18] Elyseums: @Towelliee start with Extreme Trials in the current content
[6:46:20] Qwertys_TV: Ultimate is content for the top 1% of raiders

[6:46:31] PlaguedV: the one boss fights
[6:46:31] pdghaschel: extreme trials are beneath savage
[6:46:32] baitisnicem8: Yes its heroic
[6:46:33] Venjik: close

[6:46:37] ToBais91: yeah
[6:46:37] SingingDune: yes
[6:46:37] ravn_sensei: extreme is single boss usually rewards a weapon
[6:46:39] Vexxsis: savage is eden
[6:46:39] DekeZander: Extreme is same difficulty as Savage

[6:47:07] Helliebabe: DRS is good
[6:47:07] AnnaBanana: Alliance raids are considered "normal" difficulty content
[6:47:08] Vexxsis: nah
[6:47:08] nathrizen: 48 man savage DR
[6:47:08] JinTackle: there's also unreal but that's more side content

[6:47:36] KatteBlack: The savage raids are a lot of fun, you should try them when you get a chance.
[6:47:37] Wolferey: special raids for the relics
[6:47:38] JinTackle: once per expansion type of content
[6:47:39] Elyseums: they are rough also with randoms

[6:47:51] Venjik: Discord groups
[6:47:52] NezeruGaming: discord networking
[6:47:54] Elyseums: Static if possible
[6:47:56] AnnaBanana: theyre organized in discords
[6:47:56] Wolferey: mostly organized through discord
[6:47:57] KatteBlack: People make discords and set up 48man runs.
[6:47:58] DawnsRoyal: there is a zone for it, but mostly through discord groups
[6:48:00] Helliebabe: People do sign up sheets etc for it. I ran a group earlier
[6:48:07] Anddroiden_: it's side content to the relic wepon
[6:48:12] SingingDune: yep, easier to manage and replace people
[6:48:13] TSGJamesR: You can find Discord groups for that.
[6:48:19] PlaguedV: alot of fcs are groups of 10-20 people immo

[6:49:23] AzusaBae: extreme with min ilvl :D
[6:49:30] KatteBlack: The nier raids are really good.
[6:49:33] Wolferey: @Elyseums has to finish msq here first to unlock
[6:49:40] xPEPPERSx: Ultimate is like fighting lich king with rag and death wing at the same time lol
[6:49:41] D0gz1: This xpac's story doesnt end till 5.3
[6:49:43] myllaena: Blizz pushed the emergency button
[6:49:44] Kisswani: you're like 2 hours away from ending 5.0
[6:49:46] metavahn231: savage feels like side content tbh, its mostly about the story
[6:49:47] kathyrinanorvell: still got a long way to go then
[6:49:49] Elyseums: @Towelliee you could try the 24 mans at least
[6:49:53] Bl4z31n: no
[6:49:54] TSGJamesR: Yeah, those are Alliance Raids
[6:49:56] AnnaBanana: You still have a bit to go after finishing base shadowbringers
[6:49:59] myllaena: alliance raid this xpac is a crossover with nier automata
[6:50:01] Qwertys_TV: You can do Alliance raids and normal editions, quite easy
[6:50:03] KatteBlack: Ye, we have cross over nier content. Several 24man raids.
[6:50:03] xideontv: 9.1 = 1 month of exciting new stuff + 7 months of painful grinding
[6:50:09] crikit_: are there any plans for any pvp enhancement for xiv?
[6:50:10] Bl4z31n: theres 3 nier raids this expansion

[6:50:40] Wolferey: @vocalpenguin 8 for both
[6:50:40] Wrenton: I give you 2-3 months before your back to FF14 after 9.1 and even then youll still have time for Endwalker since it will be out in November.
[6:50:45] vocalpenguin: what are max raid sizes? 24?
[6:50:51] TheGaoSora: @rikety_crikit uh oh
[6:50:53] Helliebabe: 56
[6:50:54] nathrizen: @vocalpenguin savage is typically 8 man, but there's also a savage 48 man raid in shadowbringers
[6:50:55] JinTackle: 56 is the max we have
[6:50:57] KatteBlack: 8 for the HC content.
[6:51:03] Helliebabe: 56 was the biggest, BA
[6:51:11] crikit_: i feel like if they could make pvp halfway decent a lot of us could main xiv

[7:01:31] bigdaddyslade81: fair enough ... i just wasnt sure why ... i just have seen it pop up a lot as of late
[7:01:35] AnnaBanana: I like how your character looks like you
[7:01:48] JinTackle: @Dannissh he played FF way before the others
[7:01:50] KatteBlack: So true Anna.
[7:01:52] SeckSymbols: This song in the final Shadowbringers cutscene BibleThump
[7:01:56] TSGJamesR: Yep, Anna.
[7:02:05] Pookajutsu: @bigdaddyslade81 Honestly, it's just timing. We had a big expansion announcement during a content lull in WoW. People got curious.
[7:02:07] Vexxsis: @bigdaddyslade81 tbh Yoshi P and the devs deserve the spot light for once , for how this game came from utter shit and rised to 2.0 is insane
[7:02:09] yedivinee: Which server are you on?
[7:02:10] AnnaBanana: If my character looked like me, it would be a lalafell KEKW
[7:02:14] TSGJamesR: @Pookajutsu sofieHello
[7:02:18] Kinghorn: LUL anna
[7:02:19] Dannissh: Im thinking about playing it

[7:02:30] SeckSymbols: @AnnaBanana I'd be a catgirl, yet I'm a man IRL KEKW

[7:02:44] metavahn231: King Towellie: THE LIGHT SURGES WITHIN ME, such bliss...

[7:03:07] KatteBlack: Tho I do switch to Raen occasionally.
[7:03:12] JinTackle: all the people memeing the ffxiv level 60 trial also helped in the big push
[7:03:18] JinTackle: probably even more than the endwalker announcement
[7:03:19] TSGJamesR: @KaterinaNoire AKA the majority. Sun Cat-Girls are the most common race/gender/clan on most servers.
[7:03:23] Kinghorn: coxNod
[7:03:32] Shrenko: tssss 🐍

[7:04:18] Klefth: Man, I'm so curious about endwalker. There's some interesting theories floating around already
[7:04:26] Ezmaraldaa: You can play it free up to level 60
[7:04:30] KatteBlack: But I am like 65% of the time Sun Catgirl or Raen Female depending on my mood the other 35% of the time. I like them both a lot, I do have a viera alt that never changes.
[7:04:42] Ezmaraldaa: have to make a new acct though

[7:07:57] Soxzors1: ffxiv does that
[7:07:59] Manderville: @KaterinaNoire Most are boomers I think
[7:08:02] SeckSymbols: The game really does play into the cat people actually being cat people, as I logged out in an inn and whenI came back, my character woke up and did exactly what a cat would do with its morning routine KEKW
[7:08:03] JinTackle: LuvCool
[7:08:05] Kisswani: I wonder how they'll top 5.0 story in Endwalker without the unsundered . the new little shit ascian is boring
[7:08:08] KatteBlack: I'm a boomer. ;3
[7:08:09] AnnaBanana: I have an issue with watching tons of streamers try out ffxiv
[7:08:24] KatteBlack: Cause apparently being in your 30s makes you a boomer.
[7:08:31] AnnaBanana: It's just a good game and I like seeing different reactions to the story
[7:08:35] Syllvn: spoilers careful
[7:08:35] JinTackle: being 21 makes you a boomer nowdays

[7:12:11] sinderfell: fall damage isn't lethal unless you're in combat, yeah
[7:12:12] Manderville: @Hotek Main Story Quests. Forced quest to proceed with the game.
[7:12:14] AnnaBanana: @Hotek I thought wow has a main story?

[7:12:55] HiroesX81: We must needs
[7:13:01] NezeruGaming: @Fockfear if he's in aggro, he can die from fall damage
[7:13:01] Moobot: Check out Towelliee's latest Youtube video! https://youtu.be/U8-64zqVa8k Shadowlands needs some help
[7:13:07] JoeyDevl: This game is just too big lol
[7:13:16] Pookajutsu: @Hotek The others have already answered you, but the MSQ works kinda like the new ! marked quests in Shadowlands. Except in FF14 you kinda HAVE to do them the first time around.
[7:13:20] Helliebabe: I love this ending so much
[7:13:21] WhiteKnight74648: @JoeyDevl take it one quest at a time
[7:13:31] Fockfear: @NezeruGaming i know but generaly you don't "die" from falling in ffxiv
[7:13:32] AnnaBanana: Chat
[7:13:35] AnnaBanana: Get your smiles out
[7:13:35] DekeZander: you have to do Shadowlands story the first time too I think @Pookajutsu
[7:13:38] ministabber: JUMPING pool
[7:13:40] Vexxsis: he done amarot yet?
[7:13:43] AnnaBanana: :)

[7:14:16] dimme_cs: Thoughts on tbc to far? @Towelliee
[7:14:18] Wrenton: @Vexxsis Dude
[7:14:21] JinTackle: :)
[7:14:21] Helliebabe: @Vexxsis nice try
[7:14:25] Helliebabe: Just spam the spoilers away
[7:14:27] TSGJamesR: :)  :)
[7:14:27] metavahn231: wind current POGGERS
[7:14:28] Hotek: is the MSQ enough to level you all the way? presumably not
[7:14:30] Bl4z31n: :)
[7:14:30] AnnaBanana: :)
[7:14:31] Kineticbomb: The game doesn't fel big at the end because you can easily teleport anywere. If they removed teleport it would take a long time to get to places.
[7:14:33] Vexxsis: its not spoilers lmao
[7:14:37] Helliebabe: it is
[7:14:40] Vexxsis: ughh no
[7:14:42] sinderfell: @Hotek these days it usually is
[7:14:48] myllianna: @hotkey It's enough these day yeah

[7:14:52] sinderfell: as long as you're not job-hopping
[7:14:54] Vexxsis: explaining what it is , yes thats spoilers
[7:14:54] DawnsRoyal: @Hotek it is, you might have to run an extra dungeon or 3, but das about it
[7:14:55] WhiteKnight74648: catJAM
[7:14:59] Kisswani: I dont think it is tbh lol
[7:15:03] TSGJamesR: Big coral.
[7:15:04] metavahn231: i wonder if they will get rid of aether current
[7:15:08] SPAZnHD: :)
[7:15:11] winglypanda: @Hotek yes, you lvl very quickly, you can boost your XP with food (3%) and if you buy endwalker expansion (30%)
[7:15:17] Gathilo: Gathilo subscribed with Prime. 
[7:15:34] JinTackle: almost there PogChamp
[7:15:35] Hotek: wow fair enough. been a nerf of exp and time needed to get to max with every expac?
[7:15:39] Vexxsis: i wouldnt mind if they got rid of the currents
[7:15:42] NezeruGaming: so close PogChamp
[7:15:47] HiroesX81: dont alude anything that might be a spoiler unless he asks chat let the man do his gamin. just a precautionary reminder
[7:15:49] ashanti_clan: Oo, the tempest <3 some of the best music in the game
[7:15:51] DonTicklesCNP: Full Fathom Five is my favorite overworld theme
[7:15:59] AnnaBanana: @Vexxsis He learned about it in the story back in Raktika, if he sees "has he gone there yet?" that's def spoiler
[7:16:14] sinderfell: the biggest thing is that dungeon XP has been buffed massively from the old days
[7:16:20] Helliebabe: @Vexxsis the name has been mentioned multiple times in the story
[7:16:20] Shrenko: have Lula tried FF14 before ?
[7:16:21] DawnsRoyal: @Hotek whenever a new excpac comes out, you get an extra 50% xp gained through killing stuff, and a while ago they increased all the exp from arr(1-50) quests
[7:16:23] SPAZnHD: :)
[7:16:23] JinTackle: welp LUL
[7:16:25] Helliebabe: :)
[7:16:29] Vexxsis: again its not spoilers or a ball dropper lol
[7:16:35] lyra_ven: thats why cable ftw :D
[7:16:36] TSGJamesR: 50
[7:16:37] JinTackle: 50
[7:16:37] grokshar: 50
[7:16:38] WolfieWunderlich: They always boost exp for base game + all the outdated expacs whenever a new one comes around. And if you pre-order the new expac, you get an earring that gives great stats and +30% exp for leveling
[7:16:39] pdghaschel: 50
[7:16:39] Helliebabe: 50
[7:16:40] HiroesX81: dang this music doodOK

[7:17:08] harzyar: that's a shame, she'd prob like the other exps
[7:17:10] Wrenton: @Dannissh no

[7:17:44] JinTackle: @CaptinOfCrunch 2013 first released on PS3

[7:19:21] metavahn231: people have been asking the devs to make the world content more relevant but they never do, just useless mobs everywhere and fates
[7:19:22] JinTackle: mobs used to slow you if they hit you while mounted
[7:19:22] TSGJamesR: *particular

[7:42:02] MyNameIsVortex: @Tickwick That has to be the strangest comparison ever
[7:42:03] ashanti_clan: @FutileDiploma ffxiv game devs cater to their player base.
[7:42:15] Helliebabe: yes, ff14 devs ACTUALLY CARE
[7:42:15] ToBais91: like good devs
[7:42:22] SingingDune: If XIV is like skyrim then WoW is like raid shadow legends LUL
[7:42:26] P1ght: @cmonbruh_from_sweden but the animations are really good?
[7:42:28] ashanti_clan: like.. that alone is enough to understand the difference
[7:42:29] AlekseyRX: Biggest difference: WoW doesnt make me craft for 10 hours :( someone send help
[7:42:29] Vexxsis: 14 devs are something else for sure
[7:42:33] Wrenton: @Vox_985 LUL
[7:42:39] DekeZander: @FutileDiploma FF PvE is top tier, the PvP is garbage
[7:42:43] Ken_eblerz: NODDERS
[7:42:58] myllianna: @SamTheBeardedMan WOW doesn'T even really have the RPG factor anymore it's just GRIND and endgame.
[7:43:04] momofantv: this area is one of the best area's in modern day games
[7:43:05] cmonbruh_from_sweden: @P1ght if you think thats good, just imagine what you could get with update to recent technology RainbowPls
[7:43:17] ashanti_clan: if players have a suggestion at events, the devs have a history of actually implementing ideas from the community into the game
[7:43:17] Moobot: Check out Towelliee's latest Youtube video! https://youtu.be/U8-64zqVa8k Shadowlands needs some help
[7:43:20] happybooger: nods all around
[7:43:36] SeckSymbols: WoW dropped the RPG from MMORPG years ago
[7:43:40] helperuwu3: enjoying ff14 so far?
[7:43:42] P1ght: @cmonbruh_from_sweden but why waste money on something thats already good instead of going for pvp or sorts, thats really suffering? :P
[7:43:45] WolfieWunderlich: Alphinaud and Y'shtola busying themselves lmao
[7:43:46] Helliebabe: ask if it's the krusty krab
[7:43:49] gorilahazed: i just got FFXIV is there a reason to hold on buying the game or do I get benefits if I do
[7:43:54] ministabber: Just play the games you like and let others do the same :)
[7:43:56] MetaChar: @AlekseyRX ffxiv craft is really addictive
[7:44:07] Helliebabe: @gorilahazed get to 60 then buy the game,
[7:44:11] ashanti_clan: @gorilahazed if you buy the game you get some stuff, but it's not necessary
[7:44:14] cmonbruh_from_sweden: @P1ght go both AYAYA
[7:44:21] DekeZander: @gorilahazed nah play for free til 60 unless you really need social stuff (guild, whisper function, etc)
[7:44:26] sorixzx: this story is .. :o
[7:44:26] Vexxsis: milk the free trial for 14
[7:44:28] AlekseyRX: @MetaChar tell me about it, I took a break and now I want all the resplendent tools :(
[7:44:28] shadowphase115: sadbringers
[7:44:31] skypi_712: the end of shadowbringers here is some of the best writing i've seen in a game period @Towelliee
[7:44:32] Shrenko: the free trial for FF14 is super huge
[7:44:33] Helliebabe: the story is AMAZING
[7:44:34] WolfieWunderlich: @gorilahazed If you get the latest expac, you get a nice earring with a 30% exp boost, but it's not necessary for the trial leveling
[7:44:34] ashanti_clan: you also get to sell stuff with the full game
[7:44:35] TSGJamesR: FeelsBringers
[7:44:38] RhoanAzB: @gorilahazed you could play through the story until the end of heavensward for now if youre not interested in playing any of the new races, otherwise, buy ahead
[7:44:38] P1ght: @cmonbruh_from_sweden if you pay for it. than im all in :P
[7:44:38] SeckSymbols: Endwalker story gonna be much longer
[7:44:39] Vexxsis: 10 year journey for alot of us
[7:44:40] tachankus: story is so damn good
[7:44:41] gorilahazed: cool thanks chat!!
[7:44:41] cmonbruh_from_sweden: is it true that ff14 is not for pvp
[7:44:42] DaltinSW: There's FFXIV End-Raid difficulty crafting lol.  XIV Crafting can get absolutely absurd.
[7:44:43] TSGJamesR: It's gonna be amazing.
[7:44:44] Wrenton: in b4 trial meme
[7:44:47] iliichu: this is cozy
[7:44:47] tachankus: just wait until 5.3 lol
[7:44:49] Eludi: yeah endwalker is gonna be even bigger from what they have said
[7:44:51] C4ptainblack: Endwalker will be even longer
[7:44:52] Gery01: endwalker gunnna be even bigger
[7:44:53] ToBais91: shb story soooooo good
[7:44:53] skypi_712: This xpac and heavensward are king
[7:44:55] SerenitySunfire: @ministabber the biggest thing you get from buying the game is being able to join guilds
[7:44:55] tempestus_lcie: You know what is best? That this is not end .. 5.3 awaits after this
[7:44:56] Reap14: FYI if you are interested in the story of this game you will be watching huge spoilers if you hang.
[7:44:58] Vexxsis: ik i was there
[7:44:59] DekeZander: yeah FF14 PvP is trash @cmonbruh_from_sweden maybe one day they will make it better
[7:45:00] Scrapped: Shadowbringers is my favorite expansion of any MMO in the last 20 years
[7:45:01] TSGJamesR: Oooh, right. Attunement.
[7:45:05] Helliebabe: Just gotta remember, 5.3 went up for a reward. NOT this expansion
[7:45:07] SingingDune: I love the tick tock beat of the bgm of this area, wish more games had music like that
[7:45:14] cmonbruh_from_sweden: @DekeZander 😢
[7:45:15] DekeZander: @cmonbruh_from_sweden PvP transmog is dope though
[7:45:18] momofantv: if you want pvp play a real game not a mmo rofl
[7:45:21] Radrez: If it was bigger it would be just rollinnnn
[7:45:24] ashanti_clan: @DekeZander endwalker seems to have pvp changes coming
[7:45:35] momofantv: i dont understand you pvp mmoers its like your trash at other games so you use mmos as pvp
[7:45:37] DaltinSW: oh god please dont stop RIGHT HERE
[7:45:37] werewombatx: Fat Chocobo is life
[7:45:38] Shrenko: nooooo
[7:45:47] Helliebabe: LOL
[7:45:47] TSGJamesR: LUL
[7:45:48] DekeZander: @ashanti_clan hopefully yeah. it seems like PvP just isn't something most of the playerbase wants
