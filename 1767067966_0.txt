[0:30:45] StreamElements: Type !points to see how many points you have!
[0:30:57] andoryu75: Why you dont pvp , ***re fun right?
[0:31:00] coconust1: Druid is boring, PPL usually get improved entangle and spam that with starfire
[0:31:18] Molle129: fishing 2nd
[0:31:18] coconust1: Fishing is mostly for golds
[0:31:19] Reisinger42: sec
[0:31:23] cosmosika: you can have both
[0:31:25] Molle129: you can have to main
[0:31:39] mcvegs: did the priest die?
[0:31:45] bythelightx: no
[0:31:47] xZo__: Fishing is off
[0:31:48] Molle129: 2 main and fishing
[0:31:48] spiralstairz: 2nd
[0:31:53] mcvegs: noooo
[0:31:53] NoTTaShoT: It’s a secondary
[0:31:54] CatDad__: imo, 1) druid is both easy and fun, 2) hunter is easy but maybe not a fun but depends on person - and  3) rogue is more challenging and fun
[0:31:54] Knektulf: fishing is secondary
[0:31:55] cosmosika: skinning for gold for mount or  mining/engi
[0:31:56] bythelightx: fishing/first aid/cooking secondary
[0:31:56] xanchoviox: Fishing is secondary
[0:31:58] skillxraw: half of ursulas time was professions
[0:32:13] Reisinger42: skin and herb
[0:32:25] Talason: swifty do you know what a diamond flask is
[0:32:30] 1MikeJ: if u want gold then mage
[0:32:40] xanchoviox: Herbs dont sell for much
[0:32:41] baraktus: u get gold from vending reward till level 40
[0:32:43] Molle129: fishing is good with cooking
[0:32:46] Talason: das magnifico
[0:33:00] JESTER_XP: Why do you need gold if you can't use AH?
[0:33:03] NoTTaShoT: Mage are the gold farmers in classic hands down
[0:33:09] vanillasky7788: ARE U GONNA PLAY DIABLO TMW ITS GONNA BE HUGE BOOM ON TWITCH
[0:33:10] CatDad__: don't really need a lot of gold in HC - game provides and you cycle through the gear/pots/etc.
[0:33:13] skillxraw: rogue could level to 60 without a single dmg taken
[0:33:24] mcvegs: how will you sell it? just by vendor?
[0:33:28] xZo__: I was thinking rogue too
[0:33:34] xZo__: + first aid
[0:33:44] stacktheripper: you take damage all the way to 60
[0:33:47] stacktheripper: as a rogue LOL

[0:34:16] OhTroq: Warrior SMOrc
[0:34:19] 1MikeJ: warrior is a pain until about 30
[0:34:25] NoTTaShoT: Warrior HC is lot harder than people realize
[0:34:29] vanillasky7788: U GOTTA CHOSE
[0:34:30] spamming4: Sadge man, good luck with the next one!
[0:34:30] Kriptz01: You can't go Warrior swifty

[0:34:38] Talason: D4?
[0:34:49] Kriptz01: D$ yes
[0:34:51] TheOfficialGimp: fishing is good for gold from chests, rogues are good for gold with pickpocket, you could also try something like tailoring and vendor the greens you make

[5:58:05] Rando1988: not me lol I rage when I die... lol
[5:58:10] ganxta81: we need this HC mode on live servers xD
[5:58:21] Daddecool: What exactly are the rules for once you hit 60?  They stay the same?  No dying?
[5:58:22] ironmouse34: i've seen videos of the opposite reactions lol
[5:58:23] Fugazi811: no way
[5:58:25] Rando1988: I almost snapped my laptop in half

[5:58:54] Crizzo_Fo_Shizzo: but its always a possibility
[5:58:55] noenken: of course they would. bobby needs a new yacht! xD
[5:58:57] ganxta81: u only see Palas on HC serves to 100% XD

[5:59:30] freddy_fazbearrr: you can buy wow tokens while HC -Blizz Kappa
[5:59:32] tron3kk: fun detected juliaFeels
[5:59:35] Fugazi811: yep
[5:59:41] Leruxia: Blizz can make the Hardcore servers, sure. But the way the community is doing it now would just counter it, if they wanted you to pay for a +1 life.
[5:59:45] DreckenTV: agree swifty
[6:00:10] 3shotBR: a better way to verify accounts would be nice, HC discord GMs are pretty overwhelmed
[6:00:16] cyrej: Hardcore will expose server lag issues and weird bugs. Addons are probably better
[6:00:18] ironmouse34: i want classic with the finished zones and dungeons that were supposed to be in  originally, and working summong stones
[6:00:45] rucamad: Blizzard will charge $30 for a "Second Chance" token. lol
[6:00:46] StreamElements: Type !points to see how many points you have!
[6:00:57] fictionless33: the only reason we want HC servers is to lessen griefing and to bring more players to the community
[6:00:57] ScumperTV: macro called "ham" delicious
[6:00:59] 3shotBR: Dota = WC3 Community made it
[6:01:00] Talason: swif do you like D4?
[6:01:31] Fugazi811: hc has been around for a couple years
[6:01:51] Crizzo_Fo_Shizzo: People will go where the streamers go, imo
[6:02:13] joey_duude: the community will follow the streamers, and all the big streamers are advocating for a new server.
[6:02:19] Erames1: Isn’t that the same argument as with ‘Classic wow’? People though everyone would stay on private servers because of ‘community’.
[6:02:25] Crizzo_Fo_Shizzo: Right
[6:02:35] DreckenTV: more subscriptions
[6:02:35] noenken: Blizz does nothing. Valve does. xD
[6:02:43] melgibsonsson: swifty grinding them proffessions awesome
[6:02:46] 3shotBR: Turtle WoW = Huge HC Private server
[6:02:52] 3shotBR: just launched a month ago
[6:02:55] rucamad: The youtubers and streamers are what brought people back to classic. For me Guzu was a big factor watching all his death compilations. lol
[6:02:56] Talason: swifty do you enjoy questing?
[6:03:00] ganxta81: @swifty when u go dungeon as tank...pull trash only at 1 by 1 xD
[6:03:02] rucamad: I wouldnt have known about HC classic otherwise
[6:03:07] Rasta_mage: 1 problem i see is if blizz did they would not be hands on like our mods are
[6:03:13] jared70: a new toon level 9 ?... i guess you die with the another one LUL

[6:04:30] Talason: swifty do you remember hotted
[6:04:35] ganxta81: hey good grinder...but unlucky with priest xD
[6:04:36] Talason: he use to play boomkin
[6:04:53] SpeedoGonzale: which server people play hc wotlk in EU?
[6:05:06] Talason: i remember when swifty use to get haircuts with hotted
[6:05:10] TheDeliveryDog: No Pixel also opened the door for SOOO many new and smaller streamers to blow up their platform at an unusually fast rate

[6:06:40] ganxta81: but peeps..did we need a HC Live server?
[6:07:13] thedonmac: gta is from Scotland,.. dundee btw
[6:07:25] ganxta81: bcuz normal WoW going boring...^^
