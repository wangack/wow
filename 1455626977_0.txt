[1:11:55] 91Niki: @Eastwicksavag3 You're reading too much into it mate
[1:11:56] Th3Hammer: nice shield
[1:12:00] Velashen: Agreed if you make everyone able to do everything there is no class identity or point in anything.
[1:12:01] Jimstur: can you explain that @Towelliee ? how dragon expac would be light vs void? I have no clue about the lore
[1:12:14] DehCantao: tho I like the "job" system from FF.
[1:12:16] Th3Hammer: Th3Hammer subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 33 months! 
[1:12:26] dranet11: @vulkankragon you dont like tier sets?
[1:12:33] raldrik: my priest gonna tank lol
[1:12:35] swordart2022: KEKW
[1:12:38] ContraRob: It works in ESO
[1:12:45] ContraRob: But that's a very different game
[1:12:53] swordart2022: That is nonsensical
[1:12:55] Th3Hammer: towLets towGo towHAMUP towHAMUP towHAMUP
[1:12:55] Eastwicksavag3: feels like the announcement will lead to something playable for him
[1:12:57] ANDYisMAD: They would 100% fk it up
[1:12:59] deadalon: Blizzard adding Mythic+ made sure I will not be playing WOW ever again.  Really bad choise to focus on speed over enjoyment of playing
[1:13:04] xziyn: I don't think the job system would work in WoW
[1:13:06] warrenny: @dehcantao If it works in one game doesnt mean it works for all
[1:13:07] SureSquire: I feel like it would also be a big f you in terms of balance, "hey hunter has a tank spec..... sup survival hunters waiting for an update?"
[1:13:12] scratches16: pfft, they already tried Warrior healing -- First Aid got removed LUL
[1:13:13] Velashen: even in ESO people complain about class identity all the time.
[1:13:15] BoezIRL: how is the poll for the class going?
[1:13:22] SureSquire: @ContraRob Yeah ESO having tanks in every spec isn't entitrely true
[1:13:23] 91Niki: I really wish they'd change up the profession system. Allowing you to swap profression without losing progress. That would be nice
[1:13:27] swordart2022: @deadalon you are not missed there is mythic 0 for you.
[1:13:28] mavericks312: chrome time s-lands would be dope
[1:13:33] trashedskeletor: id like it but it makes more sense for FF14 to do that and have you only do the story so long since it takes 300+ hours to get through it all
[1:13:35] srpig14: i dont mind the way wow makes you reroll, just account wide everything
[1:13:42] mavericks312: chromie*
[1:13:49] deadalon: Not same rewards
[1:13:51] dranet11: not playing because a certain mode exists KEKW
[1:13:57] dranet11: yikes
[1:13:59] ergolucky: When you are not losing you are winning towLets towGo towHAMUP towHAMUP
[1:14:02] swordart2022: Dude wants rewards but no challenge KEKW
[1:14:02] MrGharr: or simly deplete a key ignoring the timer...
[1:14:09] xziyn: WoW needs a roster system like LoA, not jobs like FF
[1:14:15] DehCantao: @warrenny I didnt say it would be the solution for WoW. i said I like it.

[1:14:29] 91Niki: Exactly
[1:14:33] trashedskeletor: what i would like is an xp boost if you already have a max level char :)
[1:14:34] mavericks312: like bring the job thing from ff14 to wow
[1:14:35] themadbunny275: exactly
[1:14:46] scratches16: just make gud gaem -- ez
[1:14:47] 91Niki: That's where I feel like they are making mistakes. They are trying to better something that was already great
[1:14:49] joneszy4: yeah wow is a good game...just make it great again?
[1:14:50] Aidler: @deadalon agree. it changed the game but as Towelliee said I just don‚Äôt do it
[1:15:00] SureSquire: Like ESO every class can heal or tank, but its so hard to balance that many specs just don't happen often
[1:15:00] Rudric_Ice: I hate m+ too I just don't do them I instead do raids and PVP but I don't see why would u stop playing the game in general
[1:15:01] ANDYisMAD: Only thing I want is combat addons to be taken out, only the ones that tells you what is coming next or what to do next
[1:15:01] swordart2022: KEKW
[1:15:07] themadbunny275: avoid PVP completely, i don't complain about it being too hard
[1:15:14] GlumpTruck: @towelliee make them game better is the same as saying the game isnt good, I think you need to offer a solution and not just identify a problem
[1:15:25] mavericks312: there is a reason why WoW has been around 17 and in the top 2 most of its life
[1:15:32] GlumpTruck: or the game is not good enough*
[1:15:42] akia03: fix the classes we have before adding in 3 more varibles
[1:15:45] eyewal: Introduce and keep good systems and catchup mechanics and the playerbase is happy
[1:15:52] dracullus: SL just needed regular patches, we would be fine even with stupid lore
[1:16:01] club420: ya xpacs have been WIP instead of pollishing and itieration @Towelliee
[1:16:21] swordart2022: Lost ark update was Jebaited 8 expect 28th update

[1:17:43] mavericks312: S-lands had a way better start then legion
[1:17:47] cerealkillas22: Suramar was so good
[1:17:49] cryft: LUL early legion people were rerolling the same class/spec to get a better lego
[1:17:57] Cafe0le: we got more dungeons a megadungeon and a great miniraid shortly after launch, i see it as a great start
[1:18:01] ActasTV: i miss titanforge times

[1:19:55] hordenandez: i was joking @fairplay2021

[1:21:35] Joeh87: @mrpresbaby idd... I felt the artifact weapon power gain was fun worth while, dailies for that chance of leggo even if it was a crap one was worth while i'm no world first raider so any random leggo drop was great :D

[2:57:04] mmrghost7: damn
[2:57:06] MILESkg21: KEKW
[2:57:12] CritcobainTV: I fuckin hope so, that name is shit
[2:57:12] wEiRdO_dUdE: It says my New World servers get merged in 1 day 2 hours
[2:57:15] CritcobainTV: KEKW
[2:57:16] Havoc_S1: I didn‚Äôt know that
[2:57:19] Ariea_Whisper: If I was home I‚Äôd help out, I have all tier on my lock
[2:57:25] Beneb5: how'd you know my mom's account name?
[2:57:25] Heero_Effect: @gamerkillance not really lol
[2:57:28] snake_like: which is hilarious they have record of a global identifier like that, but won't let you transfer across regions
[2:57:32] Dagomarus: yeah some european guy took towellies name at launch i think, had to wait to get back it
[2:57:46] SiXKiNG_: @GamerKillance what do you mean lol?
[2:57:48] lava1517: I would of said bob but zipper pants down 69 is good too
[2:57:51] CritcobainTV: Yep, im logging over
[2:58:11] lasikMetal: They need to get some content to get people to login daily
[2:58:19] wEiRdO_dUdE: The strange is that I've been on NA servers and it says one of my characters is going to an EU server
[2:58:29] Dagomarus: if you have lock dh or dks chars with tier prio those chars tbh

[2:58:43] Havoc_S1: @lasikmetal I‚Äôm not max level so I still have plenty to do
[2:58:45] Dagomarus: 220
[2:59:07] GamerKillance: Why would people login with the tier being done and people having gear? Plus other MMO's just released big patches. Its why I said what I said
[2:59:08] Mecabeast: bfa was towelliees most played expansion and had things he wanted to do makes sense he'd put it over wotlk
[2:59:11] OvenMonkeyGaming: i finished my whole daily rotation on LA already xD
[2:59:17] Dagomarus: 220 is the minimum for LFR i think
[2:59:28] swordart2022: @gamerkillance heard of fun
[2:59:32] lasikMetal: @Havoc_S1 That's awesome, the content to level up is great. Do it slowly and enjoy
[2:59:39] Lexi__Marie: anduin tier is 239
[2:59:39] wEiRdO_dUdE: @GamerKillance Well, the mythic+ tier pieces can be upgraded to higher item level
[2:59:44] SiXKiNG_: @GamerKillance Because we enjoy playing WoW? I dont quit a game because I got gear, I play the game because I enjoy it
[2:59:45] GamerKillance: WoW will always have people im not blind to that. Groups will fill, but not nearly at the rate they could
[2:59:56] uhtred_gaming: @Towelliee Just ordered some G Fuel, got the black ooze collectors bundle, the uncharted collectors bundle and the tiny tina's wonderlands tub.

[3:00:55] OvenMonkeyGaming: in 2 weeks
[3:00:57] falldrgn: apparently the SWTOR patch\expansion was really short
[3:00:57] reggiepowa: final fantasy is like 2 hours of story quests, 4 alliance raid bosses and a new trial. not rly that much content
[3:00:58] Shirey36: there is no way they dont nerf blood dk
[3:01:03] duffluv22: I think I watch you the most when you're playing the Alphas and Betas.

[3:13:40] DragonofWolves: Towelliee, there was another leaked screenshot of choosing your dragonflight. Have you seen that?
[3:14:18] Zettabyte: towHype
[3:14:35] AveragePvp: Nice!!!
[3:14:43] N3llee: How about starting on a fresh max level toon and demonstrate how quickly it is to get caught up and geared?

[3:15:32] Kneckt: @Towelliee the biggest giveaway that its fake is that theres no X button on the screenshot to close out of that screen, there is on everything else like that
[3:15:56] Kneckt: fair

[3:16:48] mmrghost7: i actually dont another covenant like expansion
[3:16:49] Aquadriel: those kind of interfaces are easy to do on private servers too @Towelliee
[3:16:55] roflpotamus: maybe pick flight but just cosmetic
[3:17:16] trashedskeletor: meaningful choise to me is fine, but just no player power tied to it then
[3:17:22] pavepawns: i want dragon cloaks
[3:17:23] trashedskeletor: choice*
[3:17:30] raldrik: Just need to Yell towStop towIt
[3:17:44] Heero_Effect: Community was loud as fuck  idk what you mean ?
[3:17:59] trevt6: @Towelliee 10.0 is definetly 2023 right? Max says thinks in comes out in 2022
[3:18:00] Kneckt: @Heero_Effect a Lot of people liked it
[3:18:18] jure__: It doesnt matter how loud you are gonna be, MMO development doesnt allow major changes to major systems. They need to fix their design philosophy. If you identify something wrong, reduce it to the philosophy, push it and expect a change next expansion.
[3:18:20] MILESkg21: covenant = meaningful choice Kappa
[3:18:26] N3llee: for the maraton thing you are talking about.. what about starting from a fresh max toon and gear up
[3:18:28] Zettabyte: Wish Twitch and Blizzard had a Twitch extension like the Lost Ark Armory FeelsBadMan
[3:18:37] Heero_Effect: I think meaningful choice in a MMO doesn‚Äôt work
[3:19:59] pavepawns: i rly hope we get to choose thematic stuff for dragonflights. cause im going black dragonflight all the way if its just cosmetic stuff
[3:20:08] 91Niki: !9to5

[3:21:51] duffluv22: I still remember the quest in Cata where the dwarf, gnome and nightelf fought Deathwing. It was pretty funny.
[3:21:51] DragonofWolves: I just honestly think that Blizzard needs to invite more players to the beta, or don't you think that'll solve anything Towelliee?
[3:22:14] net_mi: Systems like that a programmed years in advanced, they are not gonna pull it from the game because of feedback

[3:22:38] Armdel: doesn't matter if blizzard doesn't care about feedback anyway
[3:22:39] swordart2022: @scarhearth cg
[3:22:56] jure__: if you make changes to major systems, you divert resources that could've been used to create more content - therefore causing delay, which is a big problem
[3:23:03] giggz91: covenents are good now that you can swap back and foward wish they would of done it sooner even if it was an achivment or story line quest
[3:23:04] net_mi: yes, it takes long time to program it iin
[3:23:05] swordart2022: Not sure what you argue chat you buy or not lol
[3:23:07] mavericks312: this man said years
[3:23:29] net_mi: takes less time to make changes to it, but to pull it entirly is not gonna happen
[3:23:33] Kneckt: yeh he said it
[3:23:48] PvtHudson093: Remember Preach asking that same questions on 2 different occasions
[3:23:49] jarilrpg: ion was the one that called it "ripcord" originally
[3:23:56] AveragePvp: Exactly what he said
[3:23:57] CptTeempo: KEKW
[3:24:06] swordart2022: LUL
[3:24:14] mavericks312: i do think we get dragonflight covs but i think it starts like how covs are now
[3:24:27] pavepawns: it was a system they built with a safety ripcord in incase and just never used it
[3:24:39] 91Niki: I think it was more a situation where quests, items and so on was so integrated into the covenant system, that it wouls take a long time to revamp. Could they do it? Absolutely, but it's easier to attempt to make it more likeable
[3:24:39] im_n0t_jezus: LUL
[3:24:45] net_mi: to pull it away is to waste time, they're just not gonna do that
[3:24:47] Heero_Effect: I think he lied lol
[3:24:50] reggiepowa: they didnt rly do anything except remove cd on covenant switching. its still super clunky
[3:24:58] AveragePvp: LUL
[3:24:58] swordart2022: KEKW
[3:25:00] CritcobainTV: i talked shit and got hit :(
[3:25:02] Aquadriel: i hope the dragonflight covenant are even more restrictive and if you chose to swap you just lose your character forever
[3:25:11] c0mmander_starscream: I  hope Ion gets canned, they need new ideas and changes
[3:25:28] 91Niki: Get out
[3:25:29] MILESkg21: KEKW
[3:25:29] AveragePvp: I sold a helm for 50k from lfr
[3:25:30] Heero_Effect: @aquadriel same bro
[3:25:30] Kneckt: ban that guy
[3:25:31] mavericks312: @Aquadriel just say you hate wow
[3:25:34] TompsonX: GIGACHAD take
[3:25:42] swordart2022: @reggiepowa dude you talk to NPC's to change not hard LUL
[3:25:44] klindatu: can anyone in chat tell me what color we get for transforming sandworn relic gear into tier piece with the catalyst? LFR version or normal?
[3:25:46] Aquadriel: bro that'd be so batchest
[3:25:51] mytherel: i am about to pull a will smith
[3:25:57] HaxzorJimDuggan: you switch dragonflights and you get hunted down and eaten by the one you left Kappa
[3:25:59] MILESkg21: thats worse than a QUIN take KEKW

[3:26:24] PapaGiggles: what in week 1 maybe
[3:26:27] HaloS23: @Towelliee how about make the dragon flights like factions back in Wrath. Earn exalted and get a enchant for an item
[3:26:33] TompsonX: Permadeath mode, but if you choose wrong you lose
[3:26:35] 91Niki: We know what happens to games that take the hardcore route guys
[3:26:36] TompsonX: KEKW
[3:26:38] klindatu: thx man
[3:26:38] c0mmander_starscream: Hell, that would be WoW "Survivor Mode Edition"
[3:26:40] mmrghost7: lolz
[3:26:42] MILESkg21: @HaxzorJimDuggan Traitor Score 4Head
[3:26:44] 91Niki: hardcore only *
[3:26:44] DragonofWolves: nah i'd says miles is about to pull a will smith ban hammer lmao
[3:26:45] pavepawns: lets assume we get to represent a dragonflight in next expac. which one would you represent towelliee?
[3:27:00] mavericks312: @HaloS23 then you have players saying that they dont feel like grinding rep
[3:27:13] mmrghost7: i want class order halls to comeback

[3:27:29] HaloS23: @mavericks312 meh... win some lose some
[3:27:29] mavericks312: the covanent system was actually a great iea
[3:27:32] N3llee: when your mmo numbers are down... dragons is the way
[3:27:35] dyslexican1: Would be dope if each flight had a different colored dragon mount. as likea a end reward

[3:27:57] mmrghost7: covenant idea was great but blizz managed to suck the fun out of it
[3:27:58] TompsonX: Choose one during the story, freely switch at max level POGGERS
[3:28:25] swordart2022: @mmrghost7 you are stuck in past aren't you see what is now LUL
[3:28:30] mavericks312: @TompsonX i woudlnt hate that idea or being able to switch as you complete the campaign for each
[3:28:50] MILESkg21: WHAT KEKW
[3:29:05] 91Niki: LUL
[3:29:09] DragonofWolves: Nah forget class order halls, I mean they were cool but player housing it, evolve the damn garrison. No reason WoW can't do that.
[3:29:13] Rottencoarse: dear lord
[3:29:25] MILESkg21: bring back class order halls
[3:29:38] mavericks312: @DragonofWolves but how does housing change the game though
