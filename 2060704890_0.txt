[0:04:42] kelly_mac06: as a neutral watcher, that superbowl really sucked lol
[0:04:54] Kabeer19: That AFC championship vs Cincinnati it looked like that was going to happen because they were up like 17 at the goal line trying to go up 24 before half and then LOST
[0:05:39] tabxzer: do you think mistweaver are taking over to be meta now?

[0:29:04] lambowarlock: bills got robbed

[0:29:42] devilhawk83: @reippailija well JdotB is a Chiefs fan and I am 49ers fan so you can guess who is happier chrysCry
[0:30:03] reippailija: i dont know either one KEKW
[0:31:02] Krenzic: All JB cares about is the status of Rdruid. Not Football! :)
[0:31:07] theBroHam: i'm from an NFL city that will never know happiness, so I just kinda follow along

[0:34:23] DaVeganPolice: Pog ?
[0:34:32] devilhawk83: yep as one death could be the difference between timing and deleting @lara_tv_
[0:34:46] Lara_TV_: last boss just scales so stupidly
[0:34:52] Souplify: @Lara_TV_ yus =[

[0:35:12] theBroHam: colossal blow
[0:35:16] DaVeganPolice: ðŸ’€ its a fort week
[0:35:45] Lara_TV_: Someone told me this add's HP scales with Fort? not sure if true
[0:36:03] devilhawk83: just imagine if it was a tyrannical week as the DPS would be deleted from that stomp
[0:36:50] Souplify: @Lara_TV_ Doubt it
[0:36:58] DaVeganPolice: bro, this boss has so much health LUL
[0:37:04] Lara_TV_: Yeah I wasn't convinced either, but never bothered to check
[0:37:08] vohtoi: hey jdot and chat, I have a question, my secondary stats look like this at ilvl 483, crit 15%, haste 42%, mastery 15% and vers is 16%, should I remove some mastery in exchange for some vers or no? Trying to push 24 keys now
[0:37:15] devilhawk83: That timer is going to be very tight
[0:37:16] vohtoi: resto druid btw lol
[0:37:19] Lara_TV_: Unironically would make a big difference if they made the adds every 1 min instead of 55s like wat
[0:37:52] devilhawk83: looking like a delete chrysCry
[0:38:23] befek: why too much dmg has to go into add
[0:38:26] befek: stupid fight
[0:38:34] Gladexin: @Lara_TV_ Yes it does, most boss adds usually scale with fort
[0:38:53] treavorthenusance: this fight is so hard to do much dmg as druid. disc def has the adv on dmg on this fight unfort
[0:38:58] Lara_TV_: Which is just counter to what the tyran tooltip says which is pretty funny
[0:39:27] theBroHam: hero? There's a chance maybe?
[0:39:38] devilhawk83: unlikely
[0:39:51] pamatss: lets gooo!
[0:39:53] Lara_TV_: ad is ~20s
[0:39:56] Lara_TV_: it's possible maybe
[0:40:23] JeanZM_: no way
[0:40:28] theBroHam: rip so close
[0:40:30] pamatss: noooo
[0:40:44] Whitewolf1441: i think your dps mattered here
[0:40:52] JackOfAllApocalypses: oof

[0:41:17] Djimmm: WP af

[0:42:36] dithrica: i think EB is a ton of fun, but it is a bitch lol
[0:42:56] Imsosorryxo: in eb the bosses are so god damn hard hitting
[0:43:34] s_dawg1: Needed to rescue over the wall
[0:43:40] Lara_TV_: I like EB as well, I think it needs an extra minute
[0:43:42] qyxiz: i saw yodas group do that boss in less than 5 minutes i was speechless
[0:43:53] Splinsh: is the BAR left to his party frames, which is showing all of the party stops still omniCD or a different WA/Addon ?
[0:44:02] dithrica: I tried soo many 27s, and when i finally timed it, it was 33min exactly
[0:44:43] JeanZM_: le damo por atra

[0:45:24] JeanZM_: You understand what is the song saying ? @jdotb
[0:45:47] bandi1994: timer would be less tight if you played no aug
[0:46:32] SeanTKE: yeah I think spriest just beats aug now especially if you have no other priest
[0:48:29] bandi1994: I'm a prot warrior, i play what game throws at me lol. I timed 27 EB with enh, outlaw,ret, rdruid with 1,5min to spare.

[1:22:21] joffrey0101: do you think that would be a terrible idea if from 26+ keys you would get gear upgradable to 489?
[1:22:39] reippailija: @joffrey0101 mythic raiding would die so fast
[1:22:52] joffrey0101: @reippailija there's still tons of things like trinkets you get only in raid
[1:23:02] Khillion1: felt good to see mahomes get a 3rd

[1:23:45] Guffels: it doesnt need to be farmable but I would really like it to be targetable. kinda tired of having all my tier be 483 still
[1:23:52] poyc: ofc chiefs were gonna win
[1:23:52] s_dawg1: I just need a healthy Joe Burrow so he can beat Mahomes
[1:23:56] poyc: tswift baby
[1:23:59] whiskeyhide: my dad is from KC and is still always in shock that kansas city has actually decent sports teams
[1:23:59] maenkins: Mahomes representing!!! WRECK 'EM!!!
[1:24:35] Guffels: Cries in Viking lol
[1:24:45] joffrey0101: yes same, I don't raid, and got super unlucky on vaults even if I have been farming  full vault every week, and I mostly have 483 gear...
[1:24:48] StrangertEU: can you show your talents for this run please? Or have you made a guide on what talents to run where?
[1:25:09] poyc: mlb is so boring, i dont understand how people can watch it
[1:25:10] Istarimar: wait, JB is from KC?
[1:25:14] Vondem: Mahomes is a crybaby, can't respect him after that post-game huddle during the regular season with the Bills
[1:25:47] Vondem: The Toney call was right, but he's yapping in Allen's ear about it being a bad call. Didn't congratulate him at all for playing well. Bad sportsman imo
[1:26:30] Demazia: Legit question, why watch a sport that is so commercialized? 10k for the cheapest seat. It's a sport for the rich
[1:27:44] Guffels: i mean i paid $12 so idk what this 10k cheapest is. so many fans have never been to a game in person
[1:28:02] Whitewolf1441: football?
[1:28:14] dragona92: LeBrawn James vibeeparty
[1:28:16] reippailija: What's your opinion on Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson?
[1:28:57] Vondem: Weirdge, was Allen not watching the game? Lol
[1:29:14] kelly_mac06: YES
[1:29:16] kelly_mac06: omfg
[1:29:22] kelly_mac06: it's infuriating
[1:29:26] nicoboot: Jb, the guys on discord are louder than you are for me
[1:29:38] Vondem: Oh for sure, but dude was clearly offsides. Refs are inconsistent for sure, but still technically the right call
[1:29:43] silkysmoothnick: @Vondem As a Bills fan, I still respect him as one of the best QBs ever, and Mahomes at least apologized afterward.
[1:29:52] esteinsen: you should mute your gamer friends while you talk to chat :)
[1:29:53] Vondem: Definitely should be called more consistently
[1:30:02] RocketMan23: though to be fair...fuck kadarius toney
[1:30:03] Wiigglles: refs these days across all sports suck
[1:30:06] kelly_mac06: the precedent was set
[1:30:07] Sokchoy: peepoSad
[1:30:25] Sokchoy: why the refs hate the chiefs man peepoSad
[1:30:28] mattchewk: its akin to using a glitch in mdi and getting punished for it after every team before you used a similar glitch with no punishment
[1:30:31] Vondem: Fair point, I can respect that
[1:30:48] Vondem: Still hate when players look for penalty flags every other play though. Bad look for sports in general
[1:31:10] flawlesslykun: @jdotb xqc made a 300k bet yesterday on that game. I really hope one day i can live in a world where i even have that kind of money in my account. you will never see me again tho
[1:31:12] Guffels: part of the game
[1:31:15] sw0ngs: meanwhile the other team is , gg thats a great call haha
[1:31:32] kelly_mac06: it reminded me of the NFC championship game a few years ago between the rams and the saints and the whole "no call" thing.
[1:31:42] Sokchoy: when will jb learn its always a convoke dungeon
[1:31:44] kelly_mac06: it's fucking frustrating to see
[1:31:46] mattchewk: @jdotb at our party of 34-35 year olds, 3 of the girls literally stood on the couch when luda came out and usher took his shirt off
[1:31:46] Wiigglles: what dungeons do u find are convoke dungeons? I enjoy the strength whilst in tree i just hate the cd
[1:32:10] kelly_mac06: LOL yep
[1:32:18] WytherOK: for as often as the refs miss shit, I can't blame them
[1:32:34] kelly_mac06: yea but at a certain point it feels like artifice
[1:32:47] kelly_mac06: they are looking in hopes of getting a call even when no call is needed
[1:33:06] Nico_vdM: Hey @jdotb and chat
[1:33:08] WytherOK: then that should be punished? *shrug*
[1:33:17] WytherOK: I mean let's get AI ref'ing already
[1:33:59] reippailija: is that the nico who got resto druid nerfed
[1:34:52] Whitewolf1441: hey jb i took your resto weakauras and was wondering if i could make it hidden outside of instances

[2:05:05] frazlord: I mean for people that have limited time to play the game, the token provides real value. Instead of spending hours farming gold to craft my legendaries, or whatever, I can get a token once and be pretty set for a couple months of play.
[2:05:13] Whitewolf1441: lots of subs today
[2:05:17] vung123: @flawlesslykun chill out bro
[2:05:18] frazlord: If you have the time to do both, great.
[2:05:26] frazlord: You save your money
[2:05:30] reippailija: HOW DOES SHADOW PRIEST DO SO MUCH DAMAGE?
[2:05:43] frazlord: @reippailija they buffed it back to Season 2 levels lol
[2:05:53] DaVeganPolice: pay more money to play the game b/c you can't play enough is a pretty wild thing to be ok with.
[2:05:59] flawlesslykun: @vung123 4Head chill out bro 4Head just buy wow tokens 4Head buy boosts too 4Head and don't forget to buy a 6-month subscription while you're at it 4Head
[2:06:10] vung123: gold tokens are good it lets me play the game without having to lose my career
[2:06:21] vung123: itâ€™s the same price as a couple of drinks
[2:06:30] vung123: really no biggy
[2:06:41] reippailija: what career
[2:06:42] flawlesslykun: @DaVeganPolice THANK YOU
[2:06:55] vung123: @reippailija tech executive
[2:07:01] frazlord: @DaVeganPolice It's a MMO. It's a time sink.
[2:07:07] DaVeganPolice: 'executive' got it figured it out
[2:07:16] Hayotal: @vung123 same here,  a wow token cost me less than one hour of work.  For me to farm 350k gold in game is ALOT more then one hour
[2:07:23] frazlord: I'd rather log on and do keys instead of log in an farm gold.
[2:07:48] frazlord: Imagine getting so bent out of shape by how other people spend their time and money lol
[2:07:59] vung123: yeah exactly
[2:08:13] vung123: why is everyone mad at me for buying a gold token that I want to do
[2:08:27] theBroHam: "everyone" is not mad
[2:08:40] vung123: you sound mad
[2:08:41] DaVeganPolice: Oh, I get it, I play PoE like a degen, its a much larger time sink. I'm not mad that people like the token, buy it up, idc, I can still sit here and think that its harmful to the game in general
[2:08:49] maneatingpotato1: @vung123 I just bought a token out of solidarity w/ you
[2:09:02] vung123: @maneatingpotato1 thank you brother
[2:09:03] DaVeganPolice: but in PoE I don't have to put more money into the game to play how i want
[2:09:20] frazlord: I mean it allows for people that do have the time to pay for game time with gold.
[2:09:31] DaVeganPolice: if you have limited time and just want to get on to raid/m+ ... then you're saying just buy a token? its so backwards
[2:09:51] theBroHam: I haven't said anything. I had to get a Wow token for my legendary. Otherwise I just make my husband give me gold that he degen gambles in raid  jdotbAyaya
[2:09:58] vung123: gold doesnâ€™t buy happinessâ€¦. but it helps
[2:10:02] flawlesslykun: i just had a similar argument about boosting the other day on this chat, so i know when to stop talking. Wanna spend your hard earned money on a game ? cool lil bro's, i hope one day you realise that you already pay a subscription to play this 20 year old videogame, and the more you are willing to "swallow" the more they will shove down ALL our throats
[2:10:38] kentpleibro: spiiiiicy
[2:10:48] frazlord: @flawlesslykun get mad bud.
[2:10:58] vung123: @flawlesslykun lil bro wow is entertainment that you pay money for. I am@entertained by wow so I spend money on it
[2:11:16] vung123: itâ€™s like going to the cinema and paying for the ticket
[2:11:35] frazlord: It's less if you get popcorn lol
[2:11:46] DaVeganPolice: in the end, its just a larger tax on those without time. If you can farm gold/sell keys/raids then you can buy your wow time. which then just feeds back on itself. If you've got less time your options just become spend more money which is so ass
[2:12:21] frazlord: That's the nature of an MMO though. It rewards people with more time to spend in game.
[2:12:26] DaVeganPolice: make the in game shop full of fucking cosmetics to subsidize the game cost more and get rid of the costs to play the game
[2:12:35] flawlesslykun: @frazlord i'll tell u the same thing i told the other individual on this chat, put your judgement of character about myself, and shove it where the sun don't shine. The only thing i'm mad about, is how stupid people act when they have self-interest in a conversation, because they are literaly DEAF to logical arguments. i'm done now, enjoy jb's stream
[2:12:47] GumdropsTSM: Often when people complain about tokens and boosting it's not because other people are getting or doing things, it's because they aren't able to do what they want to achieve in the game. It's an internal problem being projected on to others.
[2:12:50] Neroum: If you don't have gold in WoW it's your fault full stop
[2:12:58] Neroum: so many ways to get it or just buy a token
[2:13:00] DaVeganPolice: rewarding people with more time doesn't have to come at a monetary cost to those who dont lmao
[2:13:08] vung123: @flawlesslykun close the door on your way out
[2:13:23] DaVeganPolice: its toeing the RMT line
[2:13:56] vung123: even if I had time to play wow all day I wouldnâ€™t be farming gold
[2:14:03] vung123: Iâ€™d still buy tokens
[2:14:07] vung123: I just run m+
[2:14:20] vung123: itâ€™s not lucrative but itâ€™s fun so I play it
[2:14:34] StreamElements: restreaming live every day to https://www.youtube.com/@jdotb
[2:14:34] vung123: I need gold for crafting so I buy token
[2:14:41] vung123: thatâ€™s all there is to it really
[2:14:43] frazlord: Same. It's just how you value your time. People like @flawlesslykun get so bent out of shape about how other people spend their time and money.
[2:14:46] Reilinkz: Reilinkz subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 66 months! 
[2:14:57] Neroum: but you don't play the way I want you to play so you're wrong or something idk
[2:15:03] frazlord: Right
[2:15:04] Neroum: whatever the argument is these days
[2:15:22] DaVeganPolice: playing how I want means "just buying a wow token" to fund it isn't playing how i want
[2:15:36] GumdropsTSM: Then don't buy a token
[2:15:38] frazlord: Then don't buy it.
[2:15:41] Neroum: so do something else to get gold
[2:15:44] nornh: what to people even need gold for in retail
[2:15:49] DaVeganPolice: so, i'm broken and can't craft now?
[2:15:49] frazlord: Ignore it. Live your life.
[2:15:55] nornh: consumes are cheap
[2:16:04] nornh: boes?
[2:16:04] frazlord: Farm the gold, level a mat farmer.
[2:16:10] Neroum: you can craft, you choose not to
[2:16:12] DaVeganPolice: I do ignore it, plenty of people can't b/c they don't have the time to farm and do the content they want to do
[2:16:14] frazlord: Sell M+, sell Raid.
[2:16:26] DaVeganPolice: you're listing things people with time can do
[2:16:34] GumdropsTSM: It's very easy to make gold @DaVeganPolice, no need to farm anything either. I have a community discord for the WoW Economy if you're interested in learning more
[2:16:37] flawlesslykun: @frazlord my main issue is not with the wow token just to leave that on the record. My main issue is with boosting. Boosting destroys pugs, destroys the ability of meeting new people and making friends. And if any of you does not think this is true, i legit don't know what to tell you
[2:16:40] nornh: if you dont have time, then dont play tbf
[2:16:52] frazlord: Exactly.
[2:17:03] flawlesslykun: the skill gap nowadays is so large, that u don't get to have fun in this game playing with random ppl anymore
[2:17:05] DaVeganPolice: @GumdropsTSM I'm good, I'm doing well enough
[2:17:14] nornh: @flawlesslykun thats not true
[2:17:20] frazlord: Play a single player game or a game where time != player power.
[2:17:23] nornh: that may be your experience
[2:17:34] StreamElements: fresh youtube shorts going up 3x a week on https://www.youtube.com/@jdotb
[2:17:38] nornh: but I have a great time doing my weeklys with randoms
[2:18:02] frazlord: @flawlesslykun yeah you're the guy who is butt hurt about boosts. You can join a guild and never even think about boosts. If you can't get invited to keys or a guild to raid, it's a skill issue.
[2:18:04] StreamElements: R1 tweets confirmed by RaiderIO CarlSmile www.twitter.com/jdotb
[2:18:05] vung123: I have 2 hours per night thatâ€™s about it but I love it
[2:18:20] H0bbitK1ng: i have never bought a token for gold and have all my crafts for both my 'mains'. its definitely doable
[2:18:37] nornh: same, never bought a boost, farmed most gold ingame
[2:18:38] H0bbitK1ng: the thing that destroys solo play is the mythic raid lock
[2:18:55] H0bbitK1ng: just no ability to high end pug as long as that exists
[2:19:05] nornh: its not meant to be pugged
[2:19:16] flawlesslykun: @frazlord lmfao, again with the judgment. I just love the average wow player. You are all MDI wannabe's that will literaly never amount to anything in this game, but u all talk like you're MDI champs. keep that energy bud
[2:19:52] vung123: @flawlesslykun I am actually rated 2k RIO so not a wannabe
[2:20:00] H0bbitK1ng: its not meant to be pugged is super old school mechanics.  high end raiding being pugged happens constantly once the hall of fame happens.  why not make it a permanent feature
[2:20:27] frazlord: You don't have to be a M+ god to sell +18 keys. You just have to have one hand and half a brain.
[2:20:31] GumdropsTSM: The average WoW player has no idea about the MDI lol

[2:22:31] sw0ngs: both sides to the argument, some ppl need boosts or they never get invited in lfg, gives them a good base to start off from. And the reason why the boosts are so giga for raids is purely farming that leggo
[2:23:27] vung123: no one should ever get a boost. just start your own groups

[2:39:51] DaVeganPolice: @H0bbitK1ng yeah, I guess they aren't changing that but that's also a change that could be announced later as its something that's been brought up a lot. Its a scale of a change that would def have to come between expansions
