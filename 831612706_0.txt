[0:22:34] s_t_o_r_m__: Yeah getting no loot is zero fun
[0:22:38] s_t_o_r_m__: waste of time
[0:22:48] sinlesssinner: ppl got used to clearing everythng in a day and getting fully decked in two :'(
[0:22:50] ManneehFresh: @Rawrwind what specs did you go with?
[0:23:08] sinlesssinner: i like the slow pace, just like old times in 2004
[0:23:43] Rawrwind: Oh is there a link I should us from you?

[0:25:04] ManneehFresh: @Rawrwind click the origin link under the stream
[0:25:24] Rawrwind: SeemsGood
[0:25:31] sinlesssinner: i dont think thats it tho. They are not just slowing gearing up to make ppl play more, they are making it feel more worthwhile. Its like sex bro :p
[0:25:44] sinlesssinner: the longer the better!
[0:26:29] remixonfire91: yeah i dont even wanna gear up my main alt since i have my main to take care of , maybe do the great vault and be done with it

[0:29:39] dawntreader123456: Why is Torgast so terrible for rogue/
[0:30:04] Mykuru_Sama: just curious if someone "rejoined" thier covenant, ive done the "gain again trust qeust" but i got nothing back if someone knows could you please pm me? 😄
[0:30:06] Reklusion: The more stacks you have the slower you are if I remember, so you'll take more damage from the floor effect
[0:30:53] Rawrwind: I have wondered. How do healers solo this? Or do they have to partner with dps?
[0:31:50] Clicklesly: Mobs get scaled differently for tanks and healers from what i heard ^^
[0:32:18] Berexios123: around 370k for last boss as a healer

[0:32:39] Rawrwind: Ah ok
[0:32:41] MrGattz: torghast seems to be kinda meh for anyone that isnt a tank or doesnt have a pet
[0:32:55] MrGattz: unless you get super lucky with powers
[0:33:04] Clicklesly: Door is kinda cute if you get the power that makes it instant in the long run ^^

[0:35:42] Reklusion: We did huntsman on normal & HC, moving the last bear.. tickles on normal, moving it to much on heroic was obsurd damage haha

[0:40:00] SlayerLightStorm: Kicking back and enjoying my fave WoW streamer.
[0:40:28] Keirad: Yeah they were the bomb!
[0:41:00] TheFuriyon: I'm surprised by the dps requirement on normal Coucil when the entire floor gets covered in people and you have to kill one pair

[0:43:39] nezz231: Aight thx for answers :D
[0:43:41] LoseAlotLuke: the raid is a lot harder in bigger groups
[0:43:44] LoseAlotLuke: 100%
[0:43:47] Belirs: maybe they overtuned raid so that they dont have to nerf classes :D
[0:43:49] Kaykerrs: Towelllllieeeeeeee :D
[0:43:56] Kinghorn: they hit huntsman with a nerf on the dot
[0:43:59] Kinghorn: that is about it
[0:44:00] TheFuriyon: I can really feel that reduced m+ loot, got no upgrade after a full 12 hours of spamming dungeons
[0:44:02] Kaykerrs: Hi chat :)
[0:44:18] assman_ny: Watching ya last night. Boss' have a shit ton of hps
[0:44:34] DarkPsyanide: did anyone finish Nathria yesterday
[0:44:49] Kinghorn: on normal yeah kingvolcarona
[0:44:55] vez1: Hey guys I wanna try a farming character with skinning to kill as many mobs as possible and maybe herbs. Is druid the only good choice? Maybe hunter?
[0:44:56] Kaykerrs: lol
[0:44:58] duhworks: you have to do 4 14s
[0:45:02] Kaykerrs: I have no idea how we're supposed to get a 14
[0:45:16] Clicklesly: A group did a 15 apparently ^^
[0:45:28] TheFuriyon: I'd say 14 is not worth it for the average joe this week
[0:45:37] TheFuriyon: Aim for 10 or so
[0:45:39] Rawrwind: 4 14s for 226 loot in chest?
[0:45:42] Kaykerrs: I'd agree
[0:45:49] haasmd86: Realm First for 15 went out yesterday so folks are doing them
[0:45:55] Keirad: What are your thoughts about monk tanks for M+ and Raid? My mates have asked me to swap to tank and I did monk last xpac but wasn't sure if I wanted to switch from my Mage or not
[0:45:56] Belirs: 10 is such a fcking wall its not even funny we time +9s 2 chest then deplete the 10
[0:46:00] Kinghorn: 1 14 guarantees 1 choice, 4 is 2 choices @Rawrwind
[0:46:07] Rawrwind: This week is only 10s right?
[0:46:09] Kneckt: Got the shadow priest Bis lego today PogChamp
[0:46:15] TheFuriyon: I was under the impression that 10 would be easier due to Prideful buff
[0:46:39] Kinghorn: 10s for end of dungeons loot, 14 for vault Rawrwind
[0:47:09] mort678: What’s your ilvl now?
[0:47:09] vazrith: No cyberpunk towelliee
[0:47:15] Belirs: 7 it is
[0:47:28] D3m0nHunt3r666: just do a 12 EZ Clap
[0:47:31] TheFuriyon: 200 is equal to normal mode CN loot anyways, 203 is just a stepping stone imo
[0:48:00] Belirs: cyberjunk ResidentSleeper
[0:48:02] xluckydawgx: I have a +2 Theater
[0:48:06] haasmd86: And the raid is packing a heavy left hook
[0:48:06] mistertootoo: Most Melee don't know the dungeon mechanics
[0:48:21] Quachoo: He'll get there. CP is going nowhere
[0:48:22] JeemTeam: wasnt there a dmca issue with cyberpunk that they tweeted about today
[0:48:28] Shrenko: hi Towel, how did the raids go last night?
[0:48:28] MrGattz: i mean if you dont care about it ill take your key if you dont need that lol
[0:48:33] BlackAngelxD: its a over hype game to be honest
[0:48:50] Chi_Tsumi: @MrGattz LUL
[0:48:53] PvtHudson093: i got 1 piece of loot from 5 normal castle bosses
[0:48:59] Sadisticmedic: @JeemTeam Nope Project CD Red Music is all copyright free orginal music
[0:49:34] Press_Escape: that and seizures
[0:49:44] Kneckt: cant believe u can get dmca'd from playing a game now
[0:50:00] TheFuriyon: Cyberpunk may just be one of the single most overhyped games
[0:50:00] cloudpaw1: finally unlocked the beastwarren
[0:50:04] haasmd86: TFW you cant play a game due to its own dmca....TF!
[0:50:08] Kneckt: cyebrpunk graphics looked meh
[0:50:24] TombStoneMercenary: DMCA cause when I want to hear music I want to hear people talking over it along with meme sounds going off!
[0:50:29] Sadisticmedic: I love MANvsGAME reach to the Character creation LUL
[0:51:19] Sadisticmedic: There a MAN stick aka Penis Slider

[0:57:32] 3rdbestboomy: haha thats a good point
[0:57:34] bigdaddystunna: did a +12 today and my asshole is still inside out
[0:57:54] rediils: I got 4 drops in mythic 0 today. Lol
[0:57:56] aliceuwu_x: im 2/10 Pog
[0:58:00] Belirs: our tank considered quiting tanking after being forced to tank a +12 spire today
[0:58:02] rediils: One run
[0:58:02] jimmix12: i think is good
[0:58:04] othraerir: first time we've been undergeared for a while

[0:58:52] tdawg1508: feels like the mechanics punish you more...but thats fine imo..feels more rewarding :)
[0:58:57] muradinnnn: but this is good right? we have been asking for a more difficult/challenging content for a long time now, and i suppose we finally got it
[0:59:12] Belirs: i dont think raid is overtuned :) i think we are undertuned and not used to raid without Titanforging / corruptions
[0:59:36] 3rdbestboomy: raids over xmas for the RWF looking like a go now
[1:00:07] TheFuriyon: I can see some interesting pug bossesin CN
[1:00:07] kbeltz85: Mythic should be fun to watch this go around
[1:00:07] tdawg1508: mythic gon be insane
[1:00:09] ExigentMidnight: Seems like the Alliance raiding situation will get even worse if guilds are struggling to finish normal and heroic

[1:03:22] TheFuriyon: I was surprised how Echo was saying they didn't have enough gear to down Sludgefist heroic. We're talking about some of the best players in the world not killing a HEROIC boss

[1:04:12] OneMagicPickle: What are your thoughts on torghast?
[1:04:44] Rawrwind: All the best players in the world have about 180-184 ilvl with no legendaries across Alta and mains
[1:04:50] Rawrwind: Ok purpose
[1:04:50] remixonfire91: i mean if they want us to clear normal with 200 ilvl whats the point on doing normal in the first place?
[1:04:51] Kaykerrs: Meatballllllll
[1:04:54] Xailen: Meatball!
[1:05:05] ManneehFresh: i love difficult content but some prefer the experience than the challenge.

[3:25:05] Contractual_: The mechanics are so simple it blows my mind that people can't do them.
[3:25:15] healz4life: Normal mode is an introduction to actual raiding, it should never be this hard for guilds, it will turn to many people off
[3:25:19] Urebaldd: Slutfist has way too much hp
[3:25:29] Contractual_: I have a theory - classic raiding has made the average wow player collectively far worse at mechanics.

[5:23:33] TiwazFo5: i hope they didn't nerf anything... tuning looked good
[5:23:33] happybooger: limit has
[5:23:38] swampt1l: Limit is 9/10
[5:23:48] Jigsawzz: I only watched this boss 300 times today Kappa
[5:23:55] Drakenking: Damn, could this be the first tier we go a full week without AOTC?
[5:23:59] The_Nantz: I love it
[5:24:01] Drakenking: in a while
[5:24:08] Laureolus: I like it
[5:24:11] adambraz123: givin me asmongold ptsd rn
[5:24:14] nahweh: it should be fucking hard
[5:24:16] KonradGM: it's amazing
[5:24:19] myamoray: I'll be honest, the tuning doesn't seem too bad...on point actually
[5:24:19] Kinghorn: well with the normal nerfs it is more manageable
[5:24:20] Armageddon2517: it should be that
[5:24:25] TiwazFo5: i hope they keep it that way
[5:24:34] Dr_Teemers: this is how the game SHOULD be
[5:24:37] Drakenking: on another note, I love artificer as a fight
[5:24:45] jason_tacey: that is what I been wanting for a while, harder more work to be done to get the gear not how it's been for years now
[5:24:46] Drakenking: its so fun
[5:24:48] Laureolus: I like the dance fight
[5:24:48] nahweh: this is gonna be my first raid as tank lol
[5:24:52] Molvonos: Molvonos subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 12 months! towBleedpurple towBleedpurple
[5:25:21] Laureolus: "can you do firefighter?"
[5:25:28] myamoray: that's a good way to do it...imo - not a fan of ezpz first tier
[5:25:54] CootsFC: They designed Normal for pure raid casual in the past expansion
[5:26:43] Dr_Teemers: when you have full difficulties/tiers that can be skipped simply because gear acquisition allows it to happen... what's the point of having that tier? It makes no sense and makes end-game more boring and faster to get through
[5:26:48] dirtyoldgrandpa024: CarlSmile
[5:26:48] jason_tacey: it would seem Blizz is taking bits and pieces from old expansions that people liked and integrating them into SL, just the vibe I get
[5:26:58] godlysmiley: Casuals should t be able to gear so this is good
[5:27:11] PapaNeeks: Even the email I got from Blizz about the raid said “10 challenging bosses”
[5:27:17] godlysmiley: Shouldnt
[5:27:22] nahweh: casuals need to stay weak so random bg is fun :D
[5:27:30] godlysmiley: Yeah exactly loll
[5:27:43] CootsFC: No it just means Casual have to do dungeon as well and not just Normal Raid
[5:27:44] godlysmiley: LFR was honestly the worst so rather this imo
[5:27:56] Dr_Teemers: LFR DansGame
[5:28:08] thalomus: chat bein toxic haHAA
[5:28:09] lmtheboogie: can we still install addons with twitch or did that change?
[5:28:10] Plague_GG: Didn’t you use to have one person that has killed the last boss on normal before you could even zone into heroic?
[5:28:10] godlysmiley: Exactly gear in dungeons and then raid
[5:28:21] godlysmiley: Fricking top guilds used to raid in green items first week
[5:28:27] nahweh: is the trinket you got bad? seems strong to a noob like me lol
[5:28:41] PapaNeeks: I only use LFR for the story, not the fun gameplay of raiding
[5:29:02] ozterminas: OzetkaLive subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 43 months! towPurple
[5:29:17] PapaNeeks: Other MMO’s have used something called story mode which is basically what LFR should basically be

[5:29:21] Dr_Teemers: Shattered Halls remained relevant for a LONG time into BC as a heroic dungeon - just consider that for a moment compared to what we've had since then
[5:29:43] nahweh: people were also just really bad in BC
[5:29:46] godlysmiley: Hope SL stays tough
[5:29:54] nahweh: lagging out and shit
[5:29:58] PapaNeeks: @godlysmiley sometimes. But sometimes I actually have nontoxic fun groups
[5:29:59] smilylol_: @Towelliee do you still play alliance?
[5:30:12] Jigsawzz: couple of months? more like 2 weeks lol
[5:30:20] BubbaLuvva: its there way of handling overpower at end of exp
[5:30:24] Dr_Teemers: nah, disagree
[5:30:25] godlysmiley: @papaneeks yeah a few groups are very fun people actually
[5:30:26] happybooger: let those people go do LFR
[5:30:28] Dr_Teemers: people prefer this way
[5:30:29] alex12645: some people still think raider io is still good to use but its not it cant read stats
[5:30:38] Bakuryuha96: @Dr_Teemers Wildstar would say otherwise
[5:30:38] Fullmetalpwn: I don't agree dude
[5:30:42] OrieleHS: I honestly miss having a challenging boss, as a heroic raider
[5:30:53] Dr_Teemers: @Bakuryuha96 LMFAO, this is *nothing* like Wildstar
[5:30:54] bossmanreuben: Hey is Guardian Druid a good beginner tank?
[5:31:02] OrieleHS: yes, very
[5:31:03] bumpstock75: casual player can't keep up with this
[5:31:03] nahweh: most people want to be able to complete the game, and so they wont like it if they cant
[5:31:08] balerrionhunt: If people wanted a challenge, they wouldnt do normal
[5:31:09] CashinitGaming: wouldn't be so bad had they NOT nerfed the amount of loot dropping
[5:31:10] balerrionhunt: they would do heoric
[5:31:14] Alspeedo: Everyone doesn’t want a challenge, everyone wants free loot and no challenge.
[5:31:17] thalomus: blizz will definitely still tune this
[5:31:18] Drakenking: I also think there is a category of people that prefer having it this way even without having access to the gear, in BC I never had that issue because there is alternate gearing paths
[5:31:25] duhworks: I think its fine this way, we don't have a lot of gear yet
[5:31:26] Drakenking: There is m+, PVP now, normal raids, etc
[5:31:28] Dr_Teemers: @Alspeedo says who?
[5:31:29] Austei: having majority of players quit seems a bad idea
[5:31:31] Bakuryuha96: @Dr_Teemers How is it not like wildstar? They made a game that wasnt geared for causals and look where they are now
[5:31:33] Karsus79: @Towelliee hey towel good morning
[5:31:35] godlysmiley: @nahweh it’s possible just gonna have to do dungeons to get best gear before raid
[5:31:37] talic420: ya but maybe we should be more like classic
[5:31:46] Alspeedo: Only challenging content now will be mythic +
[5:31:47] Dr_Teemers: @Bakuryuha96 just saying that means you have no idea what Wildstar was really like
[5:31:58] OrieleHS: @talic420 classic is shit
[5:31:59] nahweh: @godlysmiley ofc its possible. but casual players dont do the same shit other people will. and most people play casually
[5:32:38] godlysmiley: @nahweh but how fun would it be if people cleared raids the first week, especially as a casual? Content would be garbage right
[5:32:41] duhworks: ppl are like 175 the raid drops 200 that's a big difference in ilvl as time goes on ppl will get more gear the bosses will be easier
[5:33:01] thalomus: @godlysmiley no, because you run it every week
[5:33:06] godlysmiley: In a few weeks casuals will be able to clear it
[5:33:10] nahweh: @godlysmiley i agree for my own entertainment. but like i said most people dont play like i do
[5:33:12] Bakuryuha96: @Dr_Teemers Really cause I remember the rise and fall of that game. but ok whatever you say
[5:33:39] layercake2004: This is the boss ASMON wiped on a staggerin 47 times..
[5:33:42] Dr_Teemers: Casuals will be able to clear the content, it will just take longer, as it will for most guilds, which is the point of harder content
[5:33:53] Alspeedo: @dr_teemers says every streamer right now. Asmons whole chat today was crying! Lol blizzard will nerf everything next Tuesday and everyone will get aotc next week. With no challenge.
[5:33:58] Jigsawzz: @layercake2004 this boss must be exhausted now
[5:34:00] godlysmiley: @thalomus of course but you want the challenge, and if you’re a hard core raider you don’t wanna struggle to keep up with casuals either, you want reward for trying hard
[5:34:14] talic420: talking about when it was real classic and you needed gear to move one to the next raid next raid but he is right kids now days can't wait
[5:34:30] creamdrood: Took my guild 16 pulls to get the first boss down on heroic tonight, most likely going to go back to normal for the rest of the week.
[5:34:31] Dr_Teemers: the entitlement to think you should just be able to walk in and clear heroic the first week it's released just for your own ego... rofl
[5:34:38] CashinitGaming: so with it taking longer to clear and gear will they take longer to drop new raids?
[5:34:40] TiwazFo5: @layercake2004 Asmon's strat was trash tho
[5:34:52] nahweh: smaller is easier or harder?
[5:34:55] Buckwink: my guild just killed it in 10 pulls asmon is bad lol
[5:34:57] Bakuryuha96: No one is saying you should smash heroic.
[5:35:00] aliceuwu_x: what does a red e on items on character screen mean? :O
[5:35:04] myamoray: I don't mind if it takes longer, it's a long time before the next expac
[5:35:07] Dr_Teemers: @Alspeedo who cares about asmongold. He's a terrible player.
[5:35:09] layercake2004: @FourtyD Very true and his pug group was a huge factor with the wrong make up of melee vs range
[5:35:09] godlysmiley: @cashinitgaming probably not and guilds will farm gear in new and old dungeons
[5:35:22] Karsus79: normal or hc guys?
[5:35:24] Drakenking: asmon is a mid tier mythic raider which is fine
[5:35:29] Drakenking: Hes not bad
[5:35:39] zfylyp: He was pugging it
[5:35:39] omezy23: This boss took asmons soul
[5:35:49] Alspeedo: @dr_teemers true but when he is the top streamer for the game, they will listen.
[5:35:56] godlysmiley: Didn’t he pug with no discord?
[5:36:01] PapaNeeks: Preach is a far better player than Asmon
[5:36:03] layercake2004: @Drakenking No one said he was bad but its was hard to watch him 47 times n wipe - I really wanted him to down him.
[5:36:16] Drakenking: @layercake2004 someone did say he was bad which is what I replied too lol
[5:36:23] layercake2004: @Drakenking My bad..
[5:36:40] Alspeedo: @godlysmiley correct
[5:36:41] godlysmiley: How many wipes does towlie have
[5:37:13] jcap28: is shadow priest good in raids?
[5:37:13] sigimace: is this last boss? people seem to have lots of trouble with it
[5:37:14] Drakenking: Like, not being in the top .5% doesnt mean someones bad, I think people would find even in mid tier mythic guilds there are standout players that A. Cant spend the time to raid at a higher level, B. Like playing with their friends, or C. Don't have an interest in grinding the game to that level
[5:37:20] Bakuryuha96: @jcap28 yeah
[5:37:28] leshiltv: Normal should be entry level not rip your face off heroic style
[5:37:45] godlysmiley: @sigimace no this is like 7 or so
[5:37:50] sigimace: ty
[5:37:54] sigimace: seems hard
[5:38:04] godlysmiley: @lotdleshil it’s the first week tho so should be hard either way
[5:38:19] godlysmiley: Sure they will nerf this in a week or a month
[5:39:13] Alspeedo: @godlysmiley agreed. Who wants a cake walk after week one. If we wanted it to be easy drop the ilvl 20 and have heroic and mythic with higher ilvl if we want normal to be the new LFR

[5:39:15] Uther_The_Lightbringer: when top guilds pass normal rthey will nerf it
[5:39:37] Dr_Teemers: @Alspeedo plenty of people watch Asmon just to see the failure, like today. Only his subs think he's any good at the game and even then most watch for entertainment, not skill
[5:39:53] Uther_The_Lightbringer: true
[5:39:56] nahweh: EZ
[5:40:18] BubbaLuvva: i was here
[5:40:21] Kinghorn: EZ Clap
[5:40:40] Alspeedo: @dr_teemers amen! Lol that is why I was watching! But I didn’t suspect the over reaction to the challenge.
[5:40:46] layercake2004: I totally can see where ASMON went wrong.
[5:40:47] Nuggsz: PogChamp PogChamp PogChamp
[5:40:48] Jigsawzz: 1 ATTEMPT BAHAHAHAHA. This is the bizzarro version of Asmon run
[5:41:09] godlysmiley: SeemsGood SeemsGood SeemsGood
[5:41:11] nahweh: chest Pog
[5:41:11] Rakkdos: Oh no
[5:41:12] PapaNeeks: I like bosses where gear doesn’t matter as much as mechanics. That’s where it gets fun for me.
[5:41:20] godlysmiley: Now they can nerf it LUL LUL LUL LUL
[5:41:24] HunchoLeo_: dont tell Asmon
[5:41:28] Rakkdos: I feel so bad for Asmond.
[5:41:36] DarkPsyanide: nice
[5:41:36] layercake2004: So has any GUILD competed HEROIC for this RAID?

[5:41:48] godlysmiley: No @layercake2004
[5:41:51] HunchoLeo_: true true
[5:41:57] Dr_Teemers: @Alspeedo he spent the entire raid pugging people with bad gear/bad specs and failing at mechanics over and over, and raid leading like someone who's never raided before... noone should listen to him, esp not Blizzard rofl
[5:41:57] nahweh: @layercake2004 why do you capitalise random words?
[5:41:59] Contractual_: I did it with Asmon Sadge
[5:42:02] Reckless_Monk: trruuuueeee

[5:43:28] Alspeedo: @dr_teemers I hope your right, as I am enjoying this xpac with finally a challenge without a consistent 20 men for mythic raiding.
[5:43:40] PapaNeeks: I can’t wait to see the Denathrius fight. I got excited when ai heard it was like the Blackhand fight

[6:04:45] daniel85mg: oh shit they working on sire
[6:05:03] xvstormvx: well normal was overtuned
[6:05:33] killawatts75: wasnt that bad tbh
[6:05:35] layercake2004: The irony is they waited until after ASMON wiped 47 times on one boss to do it -- hahah..
[6:06:31] MethmM: Towelliee is looking really good today! Love what he has done with his hair.
[6:06:32] aspiration89: @layercake2004 But they didn't nerf the boss he wiped on.
[6:06:42] dariusbob21: towelliee left death jesters and now he is playing horde??? since when ?
[6:07:09] Eikus11: 10 months
[6:07:12] Nuggsz: NotLikeThis
[6:07:15] dirtyoldgrandpa024: sooo close
[6:07:21] idksupz: Bro this shit is too big brain for me
[6:07:23] idksupz: Lmfaooo
[6:07:37] daniel85mg: man this raid looks so baddasss
[6:07:39] MethmM: is sire denathrius the guy with the floating sword? or am i wrong
[6:07:47] killawatts75: this boss will go down in histroy on mythic
[6:07:48] dirtyoldgrandpa024: i thnk yall got it
[6:08:01] Buckwink: they got it
[6:08:08] pereadin: I WAS HERE
[6:08:10] layercake2004: @aspiration89 True but he was struggling on all of them leading up to it. He just needs to focus the M+ game or PVP with Mccool.. Raiding with pugs is not going to work this xpac it seems.. Or at least it will be alot of wipes if you do,
[6:08:22] Nuggsz: LUL
[6:08:22] dirtyoldgrandpa024: nice gg
[6:08:23] MethmM: congrats1

[6:09:21] layercake2004: 100% drop right ahhahahaha
[6:09:25] killawatts75: @layercake2004 he struggled bc he just wants to get carried and no one can carry on day 1 when the raid is this hard
[6:09:25] CDubTheRIPper: LUL
[6:09:39] pereadin: Grats though @Towelliee !
[6:10:28] killawatts75: Everyone before raid " i hope these legos are 100% drop"
[6:10:29] layercake2004: @MattDoesThingss Not arguing that either. I watch his streams because the one thing he does have going is he can hold a stream.. But as for the rest well its 50-50.
[6:10:31] danielhawn025: there isnt a cut scene?
[6:10:40] layercake2004: @Towelliee TIME FOR HEROIC
[6:10:56] MisterElectric: @danielhawn025 cut scene is when you turn in the quest
[6:11:05] danielhawn025: ahh
[6:11:30] layercake2004: CHAT let them know we want HEROIC now .. _P
[6:11:31] xxsargexx: @danielhawn025 usually end bosses of the first raid dont get cutscenes but they did one for this one but its just a simple ingame cinematic not one of those nicely animated game cutscenes
[6:12:04] igiveyoudispear: There is a cutscene
[6:12:35] igiveyoudispear: Well, for Venari I meant.
[6:13:03] MethmM: i would wait

[6:35:00] layercake2004: I noticed if you dont make time in Mythic plus you dont get gear.. What I saw on streams is that correct?
[6:35:22] killawatts75: only 1 piece
[6:35:39] layercake2004: @MattDoesThingss ahhh. Was wondering..
[6:36:12] killawatts75: timing it gives u 2 pieces guranteed and anything over a 14 is an increased 40% for more loot
[6:36:20] layercake2004: Show the rest how its DONE!
[6:36:24] Vigi9413: 5 dungeons without loot now... when does it end
[6:36:34] Swaahealey: I think most ppl are waiting for gear from raid to push high keys later in the week
[6:36:58] killawatts75: some Eu players have already done +15's
[6:37:07] killawatts75: and Dratnos has done a few 13's
[6:37:22] layercake2004: Ive seen Cdew mythic plus 10 and they had a lot of issues but still completed it but NOT in tiime!
[6:37:30] sam_bob: Omg the bleed tick is nothing now
[6:38:23] MrAxeffect: STARFALL
[6:38:38] layercake2004: I see HEROIC still has some bite though after nerf..
[6:39:04] Swaahealey: Oh has the raid been nerfed already?
[6:39:25] sam_bob: It was ticking 13k every 2 seconds yesterday. Now it’s like 5k
[6:39:43] LSBreed: hit esc...
[6:39:48] layercake2004: @Swaahealey Nerfed yes but not to the extent many wanted the mechanics are still there and pugs will have a very hard time
[6:39:49] Swaahealey: Ninja nerfs
[6:40:13] killawatts75: its much easier tho
[6:40:23] EpicInferno95: anywhere to see where and what they nerfed/hotfixed?
[6:40:30] layercake2004: wowhead
[6:40:34] sam_bob: There’s a blue post
[6:40:36] EpicInferno95: cheers
[6:41:19] layercake2004: Yeah Normal looks like what it should have been but Heroic is still Heroic so they didnt go to far..
[6:42:14] alex12645: they should of buff heroic more
[6:42:29] layercake2004: This is how you lead a raid I wont say who cant but they wiped 47 times on one boss.
[6:43:10] alex12645: i bet i know what boss
[6:43:21] layercake2004: @alex12645 haha
[6:43:39] alex12645: is it slugefist

[7:06:10] Neverity: maybe a 100% for your spec but 100% for all specs is meh
[7:06:11] MysticalOS: if it wasn't 100% wouldn't it be legion issue all over again

[7:06:23] brain_wash: Everybody wanted participation trophies, until they got em, kinda what it feels like
[7:06:25] jason_tacey: trade them in for anima or soul ash
[7:06:28] Jakosin: you think it would only drop for your spec not for all of them lol
[7:06:32] ShabaTheHut: wait wtf is shade

[7:07:37] pawgmoth: ive found torghast comically easy for prot pally
[7:07:39] LSBreed: being a rogue fucking blows in thorghast...
[7:07:41] Chris7013: Torghast bores me and I hate running it, but I can solo it on my BM Hunter ez
[7:07:44] Neverity: 1500 honor needed
[7:07:47] NinjaChane: 1500 honor

[7:08:43] Getitonthelow: torgast hard for hunters?
[7:09:02] LSBreed: pet classes are fine
[7:09:06] comicster80: Demon hunter dps doesnt enjoy torghast
[7:09:13] craftyyydoggg: torgast is hard on havoc dh lol
[7:09:18] Alaquane: torghast is unsatisying for bm and survival I think
[7:09:22] Alaquane: but doable
[7:09:28] LSBreed: just faceroll as a tank if you're a dh.
[7:09:33] Alaquane: marks get a huge damage aimed shot anima power
[7:09:48] pereadin: @towelliee Gonna head to bed. I’ll message you on BNET when you log in so we can do my key + others if you have the group space/ time. Night bro!

[7:11:08] Chris7013: I just get enough anima to do my covenant upgrades and that's it. I hate the grinding farmy aspect of the game after BFA and Legion
[7:11:15] BigHatCheetah: Someone was complaining today that theres nothing to do because theres nothing to grind. Yikers
[7:11:25] comicster80: @Towelliee is meatball a good follower?
[7:11:26] dwolters_the_zombieman: thats if you get right anima power or shitty anima on my hunter the final boss felt like a group boss thats how shitty of anima power i was getting

[7:13:28] MysticalOS: it got sloppier after that. boss mods didn't support phase 3 yet (because it was broken during ptr testing) and they were also getting tired, so no timers to re-react plus slow sleepy reaction time to stuff. I'll have mods ready by tomorrow and they'll be wide awake. it'll fall over
[7:14:15] kremdes: how many hours did you raid?

[7:15:59] MysticalOS: council is interesting because I've seen so many different kill orders in logs. diff guilds have different strengths and weaknesses and identify different bosses to deal with
