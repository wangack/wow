[0:55:33] jascha_surguladze: herllo, new to wow. i really enjoy arena but they shoudl remove this supe high numbers. i remember playing back in the old days with reasonable dmg numbers. just reset it every expec. you cant even read or comprehend the numbers with millions flying across your screen
[0:56:18] lilskeets: gotta love the incap on the duel
[0:57:57] ChaosEmperor24: Gg

[1:02:51] Slayer_Eagleone: OH SHIT
[1:02:57] Slayer_Eagleone: THIS GONE BE GUD
[1:03:07] Mhortai: Yes
[1:03:12] Mhortai: It pretty similar
[1:03:17] lilskeets: what happened to overwatch league?
[1:03:49] Mhortai: Bobby ran it and OW2 into the game.
[1:03:57] Badasti: well Blizz let OW1 die a miserable death then changed the game completely
[1:03:58] Mhortai: *ground
[1:04:06] Badasti: people lost interest in OWL
[1:04:13] Badasti: they let goats run rampant forever
[1:04:29] lilskeets: tank meta pretty boring
[1:04:54] lilskeets: it turns out not being able to die is good.... side eyes sub rogue
[1:04:59] Mhortai: Anyone can compete, broken into regions, pretty similar to how wow works now with LANs @venruki

[1:07:45] Magottx: resto afflic the ol faithful
[1:08:01] kusoneko: the amount of dam you can do now is insane
[1:08:17] StromicusRex: how cute
[1:08:32] IamWalnuts: thats a cool date you 2 had
[1:08:33] JustTaki: Sterge how do you feel being the side chick O.O
[1:08:37] StromicusRex: i cant keep a conversation going with someone for that long
[1:09:10] Badasti: i miss that, used to do it when hanging out with the boys
[1:09:11] ellisrainy: talking to people about literally nothing is so good
[1:09:33] StromicusRex: see i enjoy it, i just find it hard to keep finding subjects ya know
[1:09:35] dawnovun: Bro does Resto shaman feel stronger with this buff? That stamina buff scales super well with resto
[1:11:08] amherian001: @venruki can you link the warrior icewall clip, it is so good. I watched Xaryu react to it
[1:11:19] StromicusRex: i talk to people as a form of distraction, i'm in discord with friends basically every night
[1:11:26] chaps_86: Random question: I recently started playing survival hunter. Does anyone know if the 5% dmg boost (over 80%) from hunter's mark applies in pvp?
[1:11:46] chaps_86: couldnt find anything online
[1:11:47] Smexxin: sure does
[1:11:50] Magottx: hey finish the video so i can go walk my doggie lol

[1:12:57] Slayer_Eagleone: :o
[1:12:58] StromicusRex: i'm swooning
[1:13:00] fantasiesgx: motivating me to keep queueing shuffle getting onetapped by outlaw rogues on my hpal
[1:13:16] Slayer_Eagleone: LULW
[1:13:20] Magottx: "good morning" lol
[1:13:30] Arubicon: i love shuffle but the toxicity just destroys it for me..\
[1:13:31] Badasti: you ever heard a laugh like this before Ven? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGUS5Mb_hKU&t=28s
[1:13:40] Slayer_Eagleone: more motivated to be an E athlete :)
[1:13:44] dawnovun: How about I heal you bro
[1:13:49] Swertson: I guess aff is okay? or is it just Smexxin being Smexxin?
[1:13:55] Badasti: haha
[1:14:30] venruki: https://www.twitch.tv/venruki/clip/AmusedTardyBorkPermaSmug-k9rsnRR_5mE8i6BV
[1:14:40] zen_oni_shinobi: i was listening to that motivational speech to get me through a 3v1 on classic and died then that annoying sound played.

[1:15:18] Magottx: @famous1939 ty fam <3
[1:15:21] ellisrainy: hahahaha
[1:15:34] ellisrainy: dad opened the fridge and never once looked at the door
[1:15:41] gracioussatan: sub rogue in training
[1:15:43] Magottx: that gear tho
[1:15:49] heho1231: venrukis smile brightens my day :)
[1:16:10] zen_oni_shinobi: just thought of a good name for a sub rogue
[1:16:14] fantasiesgx: you see the plate miniskirt datamined? blizz endorses slutmogs
[1:16:15] zen_oni_shinobi: subcutaneous!  ehh? :D
[1:17:12] StromicusRex: i dont think enough people know that word
[1:19:06] kusoneko: sub + rsham is an insane comp
[1:19:09] Magottx: the ol triple dr kidney into triple dr cheap for teh win lol
[1:19:11] bcnchzbrgr: why are ppl saying sub rogue bad now
[1:19:14] wEiRdO_dUdE: Sub rogue is still alive!
[1:19:25] Damitongo: i miss the old pie factory whit ziqo
[1:19:25] Mhortai: buff rogues?
[1:19:27] kusoneko: if he lets you get off stormkeeper before first duel u can win insta
[1:19:30] gracioussatan: @bcnchzbrgr being melodramatic about their 10% evis nerf i guess
[1:19:40] lemarky_: is pvp on retail any good ?
[1:19:51] yesterday_potato: dmg is too high'
[1:20:02] lemarky_: wrath is giving me
[1:20:06] kusoneko: healing is high too :D
[1:20:10] lemarky_: a very bad mood
[1:20:17] gracioussatan: especially when you refuse to PvE
[1:20:23] fantasiesgx: a lot of top players think wrath is dogshit
[1:20:30] Mhortai: Real and true.
[1:20:41] gracioussatan: sadly that might be the case with every classic revisit
[1:20:41] kusoneko: the script Pog
[1:21:02] sadbeyou: i think resilience was awful stat
[1:21:10] gracioussatan: queuing into wotlk 3s for a change of pace then you get in a lobby with 2 healers and a shadowmourne warrior
[1:21:17] Badasti: @sadbeyou howcome? I actually miss it
[1:22:06] artagore: You have more damage than your dps
[1:22:10] exz_96: ven will u play cata pvp
[1:22:11] kusoneko: rsham is so back
[1:22:16] pvalue01: dragon pumps even more
[1:23:25] gracioussatan: protest!
[1:23:29] sadbeyou: what class playing cata?
[1:23:36] wEiRdO_dUdE: "Raid or die"
[1:24:16] Badasti: i def dont want to raid... i didnt do arena on mage in cata though so keen to try it
[1:24:34] wEiRdO_dUdE: I think it's awful when games force people to PvE for PvP gear, or vice versa
[1:24:40] Arubicon: i tried so hard to get into classic...but the original excitement of killing bosses and dungeons and such just is not there..the nostalgia is not there..cant re-live that greatness the second time around
[1:25:12] lemarky_: cata pve legendary / trinket will ruin the pvp, they should make a vendor with those piece only usable in arena buyable with points
[1:25:16] lemarky_: but they'd never do that
[1:26:50] gracioussatan: yup, they ruined PvP when cata was current
[1:27:18] wEiRdO_dUdE: The Classic devs are pretty open to feedback, it's possible they could make a change like that
[1:27:41] chaps_86: your mana lmao
[1:28:12] Arubicon: pally has no mana and ur at 80% lol
[1:28:25] Arubicon: and number 2 on damage
[1:29:03] noggysipples: is ur rogueh ealing its target?
[1:29:48] dawnovun: lets do fire mage resto shaman and ill play resto lol
[1:29:48] famous1939: rogue was bandaging the pala in duel

[1:56:53] DoYouSeeOk: @ihavesmokedcrack with a retail ish twist to it with runes
[1:56:53] Magottx: Think of the time waste you’ll save by waiting till last phase lvl boost
[1:56:59] Mhortai: Lets be fair it's been a year though lol. Give it some time.

[2:04:49] gracioussatan: I feel like ret's issues were more survivability than damage
[2:05:07] ihavesmokedcrack: ret just lost 1v1 vs rogue at 2k pretty bad in my 3v3 game
[2:05:18] Dinguslordx: The real problem with ret is that the design hasn't been reverted to WoD ret yet.
[2:05:29] gracioussatan: I don't think ret is gonna win a 1v1 in an arena setting against a rogue
[2:05:31] healhut: rets biggest prob was just rdruids lol
[2:05:37] VecorsTheGreat: ret needs to be reverted to classic design
