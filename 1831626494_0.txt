[7:06:32] BrigAndSigConnection: They said if you die in PVP during HC you die
[7:06:44] Applebabe18: There will be pvp zones
[7:07:03] IdolizeAU: Battlegrounds and Arena weren't in the original WoW beta. Does that mean bg's and arena's don't exist? nice logic you have there.

[7:07:18] Chosey: yes
[7:07:41] magnav46: probably a good thing, diablo gets p crazy with attacks
[7:07:42] BrigAndSigConnection: Why would they say if you die in PVP then you die in HC
[7:07:54] Applebabe18: No because the beta is limited to Act I
[7:08:06] hoh0: there was no pvp in beta
[7:08:17] Crystalforge: Classic blizz at their shenanigans
[7:08:44] Chosey: Diablo 4’s PvP will take place within a dedicated map called the Plains of Hatred.
[7:08:59] magnav46: pvp in diablo would be way too unbalanced
[7:09:16] Applebabe18: Pvp gives cosmetics
[7:09:22] ch1m1: they said the pvp zones will give pvp only currency that is used for cosmetics
[7:09:23] Applebabe18: So whoever want them will do pvp
[7:09:40] hoh0: there are pvp zones for cosmetic rewards or something... that was the plan i think
[7:09:42] ch1m1: they also said it was not gonna be balanced

[8:48:40] fatalhaty: Idea would be running dungeons multiple times but only the first one gives XP @swifty
[8:48:45] xxlchance: Last I heard, ion said no to hardcore servers in so many words
[8:48:57] Toiarc: Will there be hardcore wow servers?
[8:49:27] morilyn: what do you thinkl the best professions are for a hardcore character
[8:49:43] Toiarc: I think there should be like hardcore realms. There would be less griefing from normal players.
[8:49:46] Stickybladez: The question is, who will Swifty DUEL TO THE DEATH!
[8:49:52] RavenTheBlackheart: im sure the RPers arent happy about it either XD
[8:49:54] spagoo__: Death matches are going to be super popular. Especially to streamthem
[8:50:29] spagoo__: Lol 60 duels are going to be lit
[8:50:29] Toiarc: But the real question is will there be auction house on hardcore realms?
[8:51:01] jxakari: @spagoo__ i dont thik they will be THAT popular, just a cool niche thing. wow classic combat isnt that spectacular to watch
[8:51:02] Stickybladez: you could duel to the death for gold bets and then transfer to main for buying mount
[8:51:19] scobuz: @swifty Can you make it to 19 on this mage panicBasket
[8:51:19] spagoo__: I herd their is no lol cap but a lvl range ? Meaning you can't duel to many lvls above another person
[8:51:32] RavenTheBlackheart: Streamer Battle Royale in Gurabashi
[8:51:51] spagoo__: Absolutely
[8:51:55] spagoo__: I'd watch

[8:52:11] Stickybladez: I killed Swifty once in Shadowlands 2v2 :D while i was watching his stream too!

[8:52:27] morilyn: 1/4 of the time they wouyld get killed getting there
[8:52:56] RavenTheBlackheart: I feel like warrior is almost cheating in HC up till like 13, you can just steam roll mobs O.o
[8:53:01] spagoo__: They should have Gladiator matches ! 10 on 10
[8:53:05] RavenTheBlackheart: 13-22 is BRUTAL tho
[8:53:15] morilyn: black fathom depths
[8:53:56] Toiarc: Warlock with 2 hunters teamed up is weird because so many pets that can just taunt enemies.
[8:53:58] Markfooz: priest is one of the best if not the best dueling class in the game
[8:55:15] Stickybladez: Are you playing warrior when offiicial HC drops
