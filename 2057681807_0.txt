[2:57:08] bbox16: You can hover tooltip
[2:57:13] EoTrick: deserved
[2:57:17] keeeptryin: its hard for hunts to die post 10, even without feign death
[2:57:20] swagmeistereu: UNTZ UNTZ UNTZ UNTZ
[2:57:25] kataxxx: why does today feel doll
[2:57:44] Azkafan: no beacon req + any magical school @Ziqoftw
[2:57:50] Azkafan: but now we get 3 runes for 0 reason
[2:57:55] Azkafan: ppl cried cuz we can solo stuff
[2:57:58] Azkafan: but we can still solo as frost -_-
[2:58:03] EoTrick: dude stop complaining, hunters were nerfed 5 times
[2:58:03] Azkafan: ye
[2:58:05] lateloll: they dont balance stuff for classic pvp for sure

[2:58:27] Azkafan: and i do have hunter 25 so ik
[2:58:39] keeeptryin: whats the cd on flame shock?
[2:58:52] EoTrick: mages can still heal, just not themselves. They heal other ppl like it was meant.
[2:58:58] Azkafan: yea i mean great KEKW
[2:59:01] Azkafan: i can heal ppl but not me
[2:59:02] Azkafan: .....
[2:59:17] 1Head_KFC_MANAGER: 80% is a bit much tho
[2:59:19] MalaterisTV: MalaterisTV subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 3 months, currently on a 2 month streak! 
[2:59:19] henrriks: weird why would any mage wanna waste mana healing in group
[2:59:20] EoTrick: Thats the point of a healer in dungeons and raids, yes.
[2:59:25] EoTrick: heal others, tank
[2:59:29] drew5: !playlist

[2:59:43] EoTrick: Not solo a whole dungeon healing themselves, that was not the goal of mage healer lol
[2:59:46] Azkafan: @EoTrick i get it but its just sad tbh i understand a nerf, but 50% wouldve been big, 80% makes no sense
[2:59:49] kataxxx: KEKL
[2:59:49] Amaza_TV: oh shit its actually ziqo not psherp
[2:59:54] Azkafan: ofc i dont want ppl to solo their own lvl dungeon i agree
[3:00:04] wtfcantfindname: i'm dying everytime i hear "allez ziqo viens par là"
[3:01:19] lunearis1: is there some sort of dueling tournament coming up in sod? avizura was talking about it
[3:01:19] RealOrangePaint: hunter
[3:01:22] CptGlocktopus: my fucking healer
[3:01:24] RealOrangePaint: can only heal pet
[3:01:24] Azkafan: its just, ppl assume mages shouldnt heal but it was BLIZZARD's idea
[3:01:26] Azkafan: not mine KEKW
[3:01:26] EoTrick: No other healer could heal themselves to the extent of soloing dungeons
[3:01:32] Azkafan: of course u can
[3:01:33] roarconon: @CptGlocktopus LUL
[3:01:34] Azkafan: as rshaman
[3:01:48] Azkafan: not to same extend but
[3:02:00] Azkafan: EXACTLY @Ziqoftw so whats the point of the nerf i dont get it
[3:02:02] EoTrick: Not as well as when they could fully heal like that.
[3:02:10] TheGamingBoar: John from PETA here, it took us a few years but we finally found the bastard who keeps killing poor Stanley! stop it or we will be forced to send u flyers on animal cruelty
[3:02:14] EoTrick: It was so fast and so efficient, no class could compare.
[3:02:21] missonyxtv: lmfao
[3:02:22] bbox16: meanwhile priest casts pennance
[3:02:27] missonyxtv: @thegamingboar
[3:02:35] SaftLaban: warlock or hunter at 40? I cant decide
[3:02:36] Recinius: just shows blizz dont know what they are doing and healing mage is a failiure on their part
[3:02:50] EoTrick: Yes, but not as well and as efficient as when they could fully heal themselves 24/7
[3:03:10] ALjalladTv: oh the living flame heal is only nerfed in pvp?
[3:03:22] Azkafan: u dont have coil as warlock at 40
[3:03:23] EoTrick: loicks get nothing
[3:03:23] Azkafan: its sad
[3:03:39] keeeptryin: locks get shadowflame without a slow LUL
[3:03:48] Azkafan: lmfao
[3:03:54] TheGamingBoar: locks are pretty bad when the cookies are behind it.. ziqoDelete
[3:03:56] bbox16: locks don't even get coil yet lol
[3:04:12] Jimenezzs: RATS
[3:04:19] Azkafan: @Ziqoftw hotter streak => pyro proc => pom pyro => arcane surge, thoughts?
[3:04:36] EoTrick: nerf did something, you are not as good as you were before. Which is the point
[3:04:36] Azkafan: i cannot believe we get hotter streak w lb tho
[3:04:58] bbox16: blizz just mad they gave movespeed boon and self healing to mage so they can solo boost all of wc
[3:05:02] henrriks: bjorn gustafsson right?
[3:05:09] missonyxtv: FRIED bro,  🍳 🥓
[3:05:14] lunearis1: do u really need to heal yourself with bricasso tanking tho
[3:05:32] RealOrangePaint: its harder
[3:05:36] EoTrick: SFK boosting was the point, its slowing down gold farmers on how much goild they can farm in an hour
[3:05:46] arcane_p: they should just reclassify mage to DPS/Support instead of healer
[3:06:06] Azkafan: nice thoughts KEKW
[3:06:23] Azkafan: ye ur right
[3:06:24] Azkafan: fireball
[3:06:26] twobrat: Why can't frost be the most exciting spec at 40... what are these runes ;-(
[3:06:33] ALjalladTv: LUL
[3:06:35] Azkafan: i never done math i only arena @Ziqoftw
[3:06:40] ALjalladTv: someone skipped his maths classes
[3:06:42] prometheusx47: twenny wan
[3:06:45] Azkafan: ROFL
[3:06:51] Azkafan: true actually fireball will do the work
[3:06:53] keeeptryin: @Azkafan you actually get mop style fire mage at 60 with deep freeze
