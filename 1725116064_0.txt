[7:14:07] Capnrein: everyone in classic era is on the hardcore server
[7:14:12] Sauvreign: shadowstrike is the only realm left thats got lots of ppl i think
[7:14:37] SilkeySmooth: you even got the hand of rag
[7:14:43] Plague7: There is a PvP and PVE Cluster on the ERA realms, PvP and PvE realms are linked together, tons of people playing on the biggest PvP cluster on EU and US. On EU its Firemaw Cluster.
[7:14:59] Sauvreign: nvm shadowstrike has nobody hahaha
[7:15:05] Plague7: You gotta play on ERA not Seasonal. People play on ERA.
[7:15:14] Sauvreign: yeah theres probs just enough ppl to do dungeons and thats it hahahaha
[7:15:45] Capnrein: bloodsail has people playing hardcore mode
[7:15:48] Banye23: The RP realm
[7:15:51] Plague7: The pop doesnt matter
[7:15:52] Griakk: thast the hardcore no?
[7:15:54] delennotv: That’s the hard core server
[7:15:54] HempHand: that's hardcore
[7:15:57] Plague7: All servers are linked
[7:15:59] Seanio7: Bloodsail is the realm people play Hardcore on
[7:16:01] AnarkiPlays: @Plague7 What would you recommend if someone wanted to actively play Classic Era?
[7:16:10] Seanio7: and theres an addon for it
[7:16:22] StreamElements: Headset is Corsair Virtuoso https://cor.sr/Swifty
[7:16:30] Plague7: On EU I would recommend the Firemaw server or servers linked to the ''Firemaw cluster''
[7:16:33] eshonxv: servers are linked so it will say low but they all connected u can log into any and /who
[7:16:42] Nightsdragon: use the free transfer service ingame

[7:17:35] Capnrein: you can play him in wrath
[7:17:55] Nightsdragon: you can transfer to era servers too
[7:17:57] Plague7: Dont go to the RP one, its only for Hardcore, normal people play on the other servers, there are tons on Firemaw EU Classic realm on ERA
[7:17:59] Seanio7: that would be a waste of gear to send him to wrath huh
[7:18:20] Capnrein: you worked hard for them to just ditch season of mastery the way they did
[7:18:28] Sauvreign: aye im heading out. thanks for the help! you inspired me to play warrior as a kid and i havent left it since
[7:18:31] Plague7: You need to move the Shaman to the big PvP cluster on ERA US
