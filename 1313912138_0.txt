[1:42:37] fat_european0: They don't want to force cross faction, so you can't do random queues.
[1:42:39] HaloS23: @Towelliee is it treated like the Zul'dazar raid. the opposite faction is disguised?
[1:42:50] Velashen: @duffluv22 about time! That will be helpful.
[1:43:14] duffluv22: @velashen agreed
[1:43:21] fat_european0: I hope they do a discount for faction changes

[1:44:14] MBG_95: I swear alliance are gonna be pissed with all of the new sales spam in trade chat :D its actually peaceful on alliance normally
[1:44:20] abracka_: "faction/race change discount, server discount, dragonflight preorders are coming today!" i couldn't even imagine the $$ they'd get
[1:44:24] its____rooster: $90 down the drain for 3 faction changes
[1:44:27] fat_european0: I wonder if they will reduce the cost of faction changing to the same price as race changing now though. Since it'll be pretty much the same.
[1:44:33] merzicdh: hey, those starving blizzard board members need to eat as well
[1:44:40] MBG_95: oh true
[1:44:40] flebbooo: probably not

[1:47:46] HaxzorJimDuggan: i voted for it and I have no plans to play S4 KEKW
[1:48:10] devilhawk83: Grimrail with Quaking, Sanguine, Volcanic and spiteful is just going to be skipped a lot

[1:50:37] Colt_Engineer: quin? the PoE streamer now? I miss him in WoW
[1:50:49] Rasolagni: Going to be totally honest. I'm not looking forward to the WoD dungeons as keys. Kara and Mechagon, cool. But I think they're trying too much with including  WoD
[1:51:37] fistofnature: lower karazan is kinda like Dos, takes way too long
[1:51:53] stratiss: does s4 have any dungeons from SL?
[1:51:53] fat_european0: I think for high keys everyone will just go vers for the tankiness
[1:52:07] PvtHudson093: WoD dungeons would have been fine if they left grimrail off the list
[1:52:20] JStevenson: @Towelliee Do you think expansion features should be enabled in timewalking like Legion legos?
[1:52:43] Rasolagni: WoD dungeons were fine as challenge mode but I don't think they belong as a keystone dungeon
[1:52:50] Aidler: @deadcells well, there are few very big and opinionated streamers that have derailed the community discussions. they didn‚Äôt do it intentionally but it is what it is.
[1:53:19] slayyyers: slayyyers subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 2 months! 
[1:53:46] Deadcells: @aidler like who? I just started watching WoW streamers

[3:00:11] Mellohype: I don't care how much money you spend, but it is effecting the true  "endgame" for other players who won't be able to experience that for like 3 years of grind time
[3:00:11] dimofodi: @AmChooka I either stay fully F2P or I stop playing. I spent thousands in Clash Royale, and Clash of Clans, and Boom Beach.
[3:00:16] Samurai3434: I love being a Tank main. I love seeing DPS see me take dmg and figure they can stand in the same shit... and get one shot

[3:01:23] Kinghorn: how does Liquid spending 100m gold on world first influence your guild clearing mythic
[3:01:25] Kinghorn: it doesnt
[3:01:27] MrsPyra: theres something out there that will offend someone no matter what it is
[3:01:29] CloudPants8081: murdaJForce
[3:01:32] AmChooka: @dimofodi that‚Äôs why I play eso tbh. Less store items for me to buy
[3:01:47] Samurai3434: more money spent equals bigger dongers. it's just science
[3:01:48] Diamondead1: @Kinghorn sure, but the achievements is greatly diminished
[3:01:51] DecayedmiNt: They live free in their heads forever affecting them

[3:04:04] grimginder: Lmao
[3:04:06] Mellohype: It DOES effect my experience in the game because I don't have 3 years of play time to get the same experience that someone who can spend $1000s. I don't understand how that is just complaining to complain. I guess as gamers we just gave up that fight.

[3:34:30] Nuvak1711: No they just did it in a patch
[3:34:33] dimofodi: "Nahhhhhhh no way pandas" kekW
[3:34:35] notColt45: I think Pandas they would have wanted to do early on but couldn't for whatever reason, especially after Frozen Throne
[3:34:36] NolungsTV: alot of people quit cause of the pandaas
[3:34:36] Nuvak1711: Which was unfortunate
[3:34:36] JackHealMe: Man all the people who left because of pandas is hilarious
[3:34:39] Aquadriel: i mean, it was a joke KEKW
[3:34:39] SkiaTheShade: That's why Pandaria ended up being good I think, there was no pandering or catering. It just was what it was
[3:34:40] nouwandhi: Maybe they said "Let¬¥s release it when we have no more ideas on what to do "!!!!
[3:34:41] JackHealMe: like people were angry

[3:35:12] JackHealMe: it was one of the best
[3:35:13] zulway_: the zones were exceptional
[3:35:16] Nice_n_Dicey: @SkiaTheShade no pandaing
[3:35:19] Tambandia: MoP got those dope transmogs
[3:35:19] SkiaTheShade: I really liked MOP, not at first but after a bit
[3:35:22] SensationalBanana: Class design was on point in MoP. 5.2 is my all-time favourite patch!
[3:35:25] ryanmoss35: balancing was sooo good also
[3:35:27] Arms_Warrior: the first month of mop was 6 hours of daily quests every day, after that I loved it
[3:35:29] notColt45: The questing and gearing was so well designed too
[3:35:36] Deadcells: Wonder what‚Äôs next after Dragonflight‚Ä¶.
[3:35:40] SkiaTheShade: The questing was fun, yeah
[3:35:40] HaloS23: @Towelliee thats the feel i hope dragonflight gives!

[3:36:58] grimginder: nice
[3:37:00] wEiRdO_dUdE: But like that Timeless Isle concept still has an influence on the game today
[3:37:05] adxx: The garrison was why i loved WoD. but outside of that, it was a very lackluster expansion. Lack of content
[3:37:09] masterbenis1: MoP was the best DLC IMO
[3:37:31] bruce_almighty: @dimofodi 50
[3:37:50] d_elven_lord: I am having less fun in SL than I did in the first parts of WoD...but something about the spirt realm just bothers me
[3:38:18] DeanoTV: @d_elven_lord oh ye sitting in garrison doing nothing fuuun LUL
[3:38:33] d_elven_lord: I avoid the MAW as much as possible

[3:38:48] CodyDaBrodie: So I‚Äôm sure queueing for dungeons leveling will be fast af huh?
[3:38:53] dimofodi: @bruce_almighty What's the point then!? Didn't they tout TW as a way to play with your returning friends/new friends not in the current content? Thank you for answering though.
[3:39:05] ZealotryTV: yeah but WoD paved the way for them to make Legion great. they didnt have a choice

[3:39:48] hikaritd: Legion AP farming <3 the more you farm, the stronger you are. simple
[3:39:52] Lamp680: Sometimes you need a bad phase/xpac to get them to not rest on their past.

[3:42:02] dimofodi: I'm 100% on board with riding being like covenants.
[3:42:03] d_elven_lord: @WOOPsWOOP agree
[3:42:05] adxx: @Towelliee i know it would cost an entire expac cycle in development, but a housing system I think would be great for casuals and hardcore players alike. Everyone is asking for that
[3:42:09] Aidler: I don‚Äôt raid and do no M+ so if there is nothing else to do‚Ä¶.
[3:42:14] Nebulizer87: but yeah i want more than just M+, Arena, and Raid i think they have attempted with islands, warfronts, torghast but nothing has stuck
[3:42:14] dimofodi: Covenants only sucked because they refused to pull the ripcord.
[3:42:38] Metket: for collectionist they did an amazing job(!) with requiring 3 million anima + 7k gratefull offering to get everything cosmetic wise ( srsly its worse then grinding AP)
[3:42:42] dimofodi: @Nebulizer87 mage tower? Only issue is having to refresh rewards and updating it in some way?

[4:00:32] Kisswani: Pit had fun moments tho
[4:00:37] Keyastaron_: whats the biggest bag in the game?
[4:00:57] Aquadriel: @Towelliee problem with pits eventually was that people wanted to skip shit and fucked up, which was dooming
[4:00:59] wEiRdO_dUdE: Pit of Saron just had that one mechanic where you had to hide behind a rock, I ran that dozens of times to get PvP weapons
[4:01:02] Kisswani: 32 slots I think @keyastaron_
[4:01:04] Jewishraver: Hated pos still do to this day. As much as ocu
[4:01:04] HaloS23: @Towelliee the tunnel is what killed my pugs most...

[4:02:35] M2thew: i can already imagine those shadowmourne sell runs
[4:02:44] ITXElite: classic needs LFG to keep the game alive
[4:02:51] ErosnPsyche: i thought u said 6-10mo ago that wotlk is goin to come with some nice changes... it turned out bad.
[4:03:07] Keyastaron_: @Kisswani  its Papa's Mint Condition Bag 34 slots

[4:03:59] zakare232: LFG was not added until late WOTLK they should do it like that
[4:03:59] CrunkyBrewster: I say just limit it to Normal Dungeons. I honestly think its more to do with people blowing through Heroics for Badge gear

[4:05:24] Keyastaron_: @Towelliee  flying in Azeroth ( eastern kingdoms and Kalimdor ) didnmt come out til Cata?
[4:05:27] icehawk_x: thats how i play now, solo mostly lol
[4:05:47] CrunkyBrewster: i was one of those players who never raided in tbc. wrath was when i got my taste
[4:05:48] Kisswani: I did two things in wrath that I didn't in TBC : 1 - Joined a guild , 2 - started using keybinds KEKW
[4:05:55] icehawk_x: solo only gets you so far though, i have next no nothing in terms of raid content
[4:06:01] Aidler: I strictly play solo
[4:06:27] ITXElite: its hard to join guilds in classic if you dont play that often
[4:06:29] CrunkyBrewster: there was a few quests like that in Wrath
[4:06:36] CrunkyBrewster: in Dragonblight
[4:06:37] Arms_Warrior: bird in storm peaks quest
[4:06:39] Snabido: There were less group quests indeed
[4:06:41] CrunkyBrewster: I recall
[4:06:50] temp3st98: thassarian?
[4:07:06] Kisswani: not soloing quests ? *laughs in warlock *
[4:07:47] josephrt10: unless they make mobs harder to kill
[4:07:55] Aidler: guess that‚Äôs why I stopped playing in wrath and only came back once they started LFR at the end of cat
[4:07:58] CrunkyBrewster: i wish they add premade finder
[4:08:03] CrunkyBrewster: but i somehow doubt it
[4:08:09] CrunkyBrewster: i think they dont want bots using it
[4:08:21] zakare232: people use addons on BC anyway for dungeons

[4:27:25] CrunkyBrewster: communities however can cross-faction i believe.
[4:27:46] duffluv22: Why is there ever an imbalance? the racials for raid. I remember when horde was the lesser of the 2.

[4:29:43] TheHoboWithAShotgun: wish dungeon/raid finder was cross faction
[4:29:51] MrsPyra: @telios_da_paladin title says "playing on EU"
[4:29:57] Atem___: tip of the iceberg
[4:30:08] CrunkyBrewster: i think they'll do cross-faction LFD eventually. it's probably just a lot of work they need to do under the hood
[4:30:10] Collected1: i want account wide guilds
[4:30:13] telios_da_paladin: @MrsPyra ope, your right. didnt even read that part

[4:30:20] CrunkyBrewster: wait it is?
[4:30:20] MrsPyra: :)
[4:30:26] childish_brandin0: Is cross-faction trading available? Like if an alliance player gets gear a horde player needs
[4:30:28] NieIas: for premade groups yes
[4:30:31] adxx: @Towelliee they would have to rework achievements, guild-specific rewards (like gold) which affects serv economy's, etc.
[4:30:32] Jahuki: ye that was the update
[4:30:32] CrunkyBrewster: i thought they said no LFD?
[4:30:33] Voidemirl: Voidemirl subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 4 months! your genuine passion and excitement for games is a blessing to us all.
[4:30:36] j_bar111: I dont think random dungeons are cross faction

[4:42:16] willy_billy_silly: wish i could afford a EU account
[4:42:28] dimofodi: My favorite is how so many of them want(ed) no changes but they want them to create new patches for Vanilla and build off that because they don't like the direction the game went!
[4:42:29] CrunkyBrewster: mmmhmmm
[4:42:32] instructOS: bandwagon andys
[4:42:48] jskillz777: cata next and it will rip classic

[4:43:29] PokerFaceMoose: that is a pretty cynical take. though probably mostly true. maybe some realizes when they started playing classic vanilla that no changes was a bad stance
[4:43:34] xNingg: horde or alliance
[4:43:53] Loonytic: idc how people still play wow need NEW
[4:44:17] xRykku: Classic is nastalgia but retail is a better game systematically
[4:44:27] reqluim66: Alliance ask for blood elf‚Äôs racials LUL
[4:44:28] SensationalBanana: They had to eat crow and realize that nostalgia-tinted goggles is a thing they suffered from.
[4:44:29] Red_Dead_Redeem: it was some of the changes were actually good and no changes was stale and not good
[4:44:33] cothxd: literally every "classic" server ends up being the "favorite" expansion
[4:44:39] cothxd: fucking cringe
[4:44:47] dimofodi: They also played it like doing the Vanilla content was going to be hard when everyone knew it wouldn't be!

[6:19:53] Respls: that would be nice
[6:19:55] willy_billy_silly: gold tokens were meant to get rid of asain spammers
[6:20:02] vadermug: that does not sound at all like something a mobile game would allow
[6:20:03] histano: is this a rerun or EU server?
[6:20:09] fatherfrag: you make enough gold you could buy the next xpac with it
[6:20:11] gdcotton: EU

[6:21:01] akaari5486: i wish they remove wow token,hate it so much'
[6:21:01] t4lco: bought SL with gold, yes :)

[6:21:41] gdcotton: Im sitting on around $1600 in bnet balance at this point, havent paid for shit in awhile
[6:21:47] adxx: i make a very good income, buying a few tokens every expansion to "gold me up" for my time is worth it to me. I can't farm and play AH everyday due to personal shit
[6:22:05] willy_billy_silly: WoW is one of few games you can pay ingame currency for a sub
[6:22:06] vic_ave: I'm really confused what wow tokens are doing to ppl that they hate it so much.? I could careless
[6:22:08] BoomSquad41: 18th is my birthday so that's a better date

[6:23:05] Crowargus: i just looking fwd to watching alpha i need to see something new in wow lol
[6:23:07] TomCat: Hikons probably can pay for 250 years of WoW subs if he used his gold
[6:23:08] Kisswani: @Myndjestyr I only convert bnet balance to buy the basic version of the expansion LUL
[6:23:09] abracka_: @VicAva12 IE: classic tbc, no token but there is rampant gold buying/GDKP runs
[6:23:11] i_cassius: Wasn't the wow token a response to wildstars sub system?
[6:23:16] Patadot: All my Overwatch skin are from WoW token
[6:23:18] gdcotton: Anything ive gotten off Bnet for 5? years now has been strictly from gold

[7:22:20] JediNeo99999: As we prepare to launch Diablo Immortal on June 2 at 10 a.m. PDT for iOS, Android, and PC in Open Beta, some players will see Immortal propagate on the Apple App Store and Google Play beginning the morning of June 1 PDT. This is in part due to the nature of how mobile games rollout and to ensure a smooth full launch for the mobile version of Immortal.
[7:22:28] BigJustin26: one of the most significant = we're forgetting shadowlands ever existed
[7:22:29] shanks_blank: @Towelliee diablo immortal releases this saturday ?

[7:22:53] bypized: Diablo Immortal Classic when
[7:22:56] Gingerprimer: @shanks_blank mobile is june 1st
[7:23:17] pereadin: I think being able to play with the opposing faction is content in itself. New friends to make. And TR M+ strats coming to live.
[7:23:17] bypized: How much is the battle pass in DI:
[7:24:32] 24sevn: $15 a month? oof
[7:24:53] aumixp: Pretty wierd they dont do any cross promotion with wow like hs has done @towelliee

[7:26:43] itsrambo: now we can truly troll him
[7:26:54] bypized: Wouldnt be too canibalistic to make the pass the same cost of a1 month in WoW? Considering that a lot of your players will be trying it out?
[7:27:00] pereadin: Do you have an ETA on WAR beta by chance Towel?
[7:27:06] LadyJasmin: ICC dance off

[7:34:34] PvtHudson093: at least we got comped extra days if there were issues
[7:34:37] belaham: patch days use to be the worst....log in and the server was almost unplayable and they would have to restart the servers multiple times
[7:34:43] Unciatim: ever everquest patch weeks...
[7:34:43] harver: And thats why you NEVER take tuesday off for a patch day
[7:34:55] DragonofWolves: Plus back in 04 I don't think Twitter even existed.
[7:35:00] bypized: @Towelliee How many more people would be playing Diablo Immortal if this server maintanence happened during DI launch? Or that would cause too many people to stop playing it when 9.2.5 launches?
[7:35:04] Noshpan: That's why Crushridge used to have the nickname of Crashridge
[7:35:56] FenrirTheUnbound: oh nice soundtrack

[7:40:00] aduma35: Whats the encrypted content in the new patch?
[7:40:15] sinlesssinner: they must be preparing something huge for them to take this long, prepurchase and such @Towelliee
[7:40:17] the_SAVCXX_NXMAD: did fate raids start today too? or just cross faction gameplay

[7:41:17] vadermug: so many assumptions it hurts
[7:41:21] Tyvokkaa: wonder how that will impact engineering if at all
[7:41:24] FenrirTheUnbound: i might level a gnome or goblin now that u said that
[7:41:31] raldrik: If they can go 24 hours without having to shut down for exploits it will be a huge win. I am glad they are doing this on a .5 patch and not waiting for 10.0
[7:41:32] F1dg1t: horde and alliance playing together? how?
[7:41:41] catswithpica: What is a good race and class for a beginner noob?

[7:42:22] dinomiyte: lmao
[7:42:27] Darkonmaze: Its slow wow
[7:42:35] itsrambo: the patch switch is right next to the giant server crash button
[7:42:40] poubellegames: as someone who works in software dev on a code base way simpler than wow, there's no way there's a single easy change in wow lol
[7:42:40] wildwittra: i wonder how many bugged interactions between Horde-alliance we will se the next few days
[7:42:40] Velashen: It‚Äôs in a pretty limited capacity though. Maybe the spaghetti code is to blame.
[7:42:41] Darkonmaze: idk what it is

[7:47:13] trivotix: I had a horde tank ask for lust and I told him I didn't have it.
[7:47:14] Darkonmaze: @F1dg1t were you in a guild called Blood Lords for a bit?
[7:47:20] channel_ekho: I actually got roasted once when I was playing horde and called it hero lol
[7:47:24] SpookBoio: my guild leader uses "The H- word" in raids
[7:47:27] ursinealli: the people I know that call it hero are people that have only played Alliance, I've played both but started Horde and I say lust

[7:57:44] DogShep: @Darkonmaze they're not taking it over. They're just buying ActiBlizz. They won't take over development.
[7:57:50] Masqerader: that's why blizzard always puts "estimated"
[7:57:55] Darkonmaze: ah
[7:57:57] excessior: always been early
[7:58:19] Masqerader: Blizzard techs be like "they should be up now" but hell fuck em let them wait

[7:59:01] zulway_: servers should be up in about 2 hours then? sorry, i suck with timezones
[7:59:06] Dazdari: That‚Äôs how you know the real devs are back on shift, when they literally don‚Äôt give a sh*t keeping players wait
[7:59:14] Erielle04: How likely is a faction change discount?
[7:59:29] Moobot: Calm it with those symbols, @iknowido (warning)

[8:00:47] Snabido: Vault of Tokens sounds nice
[8:00:47] WOOPsWOOP: Only 30 more minutes on my 8 day ban
[8:00:47] trivotix: In 10.0 will faction changes even be a thing? Or will it be just a race change?
[8:00:50] iknowido: my alts vault!
[8:00:55] yuvalal: 10 min to 9.2.5?!
[8:00:57] vadermug: asmr in wow now?
[8:01:05] excessior: they know people will pay for  faction change so why make less money
[8:01:11] Masqerader: @WildRagexz especially if someone fucked ur warlord ranking or hw ranking over that week
[8:01:12] Snabido: Last time I heard that saying was about Legion expansion reveal with the Fel Reaver noise
[8:01:13] NieIas: upon login magni will scream: CHAMPION AZEROTH IS BLEEDING
[8:01:15] trivotix: I think we will have to see Garona in 10.0. I think that would be an awesome way to pull it together.

[8:40:01] jmalmin: Didnt most of the Toxic people run off to Final Fantasy, until they do not like that game anymore either?

[8:43:49] jmalmin: Sometimes it just takes longer to get the server up. There is allot of things being added in this patch. Many small things and anything can break.
[8:43:50] jkitchin75: ask panda to get you 1 @Towelliee
[8:43:54] PvtHudson093: Back in my day you were lucky if the patch day didnt last a whole day

[8:45:39] archer2342: They're the outcast from the burning of the tree i thought?
[8:45:39] jmalmin: Dark rangers is a mix of blood elves and night elves. There is a storyline involving Calia which is still encrypted from what I understand.
[8:45:44] bypized: Tyrande goes back at the end of Shadowlands and Sylvanas people are lost without a leader
[8:45:46] Moskeebee: yeah i can get a dark ranger hood for hunters ..quest in the trueshotlodge
[8:45:47] NieIas: you tell us Kappa
[8:45:51] srs_business: They'd probably just be a green fire equivalent for hunters
[8:45:52] Ouyani: Jailer who ??
[8:45:56] fistofnature: the reason why its taking so long is because they are finally removing the silithus sword monkaS
[8:45:58] TheCliffyShow: Dark Rangers are evil Power Rangers, duh. Like Tommy Oliver when he first debuted.
[8:46:00] gingerbasterd: @Dudutoolbox Difference being FFXIV players are cry babies and they know its coming
[8:46:05] kamikazis: well there will be a red yellow blue and pink ranger in order to complete the megazord...

[8:46:13] adxx: lightforged undead that can be paladins, and a reskinned BE (again) for dark ranger aesthetic, or "allied race" thats my guess either one of those
[8:46:14] s10g0d: spill it you Towell!
[8:46:24] Atruis_: Why is a jailer
[8:46:28] Gingervitis_: The only thing people will remember about the jailer is his nips
[8:46:28] Ouyani: gold
[8:46:31] cidthesloth420: @adxx didnt even have to be patch day i remeber certain servers being offline when others were online  early wow was a mess just patching

[8:47:52] Gingervitis_: In this patch, Blizzard will do my taxes
[8:47:53] HaxzorJimDuggan: 10 hour maintenance just for gnomes in my M+

[8:48:15] jmalmin: Biggest thing is being able to send gold and stuff from Alliance to Horde. being grouped together does not really matter to me... but sending stuff to my alts is amazing.

[8:55:20] feherlofia123: EU should be faster right
[8:55:27] srs_business: Cross faction probably has a bunch of edge cases they need to make sure are working, it's going to be really awkward if they accidentally allow a way to make cross faction guilds before they're ready
[8:55:36] XshadowturkeyX: most useless addtion to wow the selfie cam when you allready had alt+z and prtsc
[8:55:41] jmalmin: does immortal release on PC and on the phone at the sametime?

[10:00:42] 91Niki: @Heyhowsitgoingtonight Yeah but the Dutch/Belgian government are special snowflakes when it comes to MTX rules. So take that decision with a grain of salt

[10:00:50] jkitchin75: @Pink_Cassie whats the outdoors you talk of

[10:02:50] BfAleTitan: @91Niki yea i know it's not a new thing lol
[10:02:55] jkitchin75: @Pink_Cassie yep growing old sucks
[10:03:02] Jakeysnakes13: people play diablo?
[10:03:06] GamerKillance: Just so many companies release unfinished games and sell the rest with "DLC" for like 40$. Its really stupid
[10:03:52] Subjektive: like bf2042 lol
[10:04:01] Xsidious: lore wise when does this take place in diablo?
[10:04:12] GamerKillance: Nintendo has been the greedy fucks right next to EA when it comes to doing that. Really hate them right now
[10:04:14] Velashen: I think it will be interesting to see how Diablo 4 can coexist with it
[10:04:15] DragonofWolves: Between 3 and 4 I think?
[10:04:35] GamerKillance: Nintendo releasing all their games incomplete lately
[10:04:40] Toon11: I remember they said it was like a prequel to 3
[10:04:51] smokingcactus: LOL damnit
[10:04:56] Subjektive: diablo 2.5
[10:05:03] nishdj: team depp or team heard? @Towelliee
[10:05:05] dmac614: When are servers suppose to go live?
[10:05:07] GamerKillance: Don't beg and you won't be banned by mods. Zero tolerance here
[10:05:15] KonceptionZ: @dmac614 8pm EST
[10:05:16] neo_0098: the dragonflight Alpha is probably still 3-4 months away
[10:05:24] nullfront: doesn't that really limit the scale of what can be accomplished in the lore?
[10:05:29] dmac614: @konceptionz Ty
[10:05:32] galifax2: I‚Äôm hoping preorder is soon
[10:05:38] Niksen_99: Have you already tried the game at blizzcon Towel? Is it easy to control your character on a phone
[10:05:43] Toon11: 3-4 weeks?
[10:05:45] ShaunsterTheMonster: He knows
[10:05:49] IchabodCrain: 10.0 is probly 3-4 months
[10:05:50] GamerKillance: Hoping it doesn't come out by christmas. That screams a rushed job
[10:06:01] ShowDUH: @IchabodCrain way more than that lol
[10:06:01] Thoreya: MrGM says it‚Äôs weeks before alpha prob
[10:06:08] duffluv22: 'Gratz on the 60. Had to cut the grass..lol

[10:06:33] neo_0098: I opted in for the beta but I doubt ill ever get access to it lol
[10:06:42] babadookz1251: @Towelliee  you might get KSM at this rate with servers
[10:06:51] GamerKillance: @galifax2 Microsoft is also involved now. idk if they have a say yet, but if they do I can see them rushing DragonFlight with their track history
[10:07:00] Subjektive: could dragonflight have a shorter alpha/beta because they dont have to test as many big features as expansions with barrowed power?
[10:07:06] Taylormade2711: do you think they will do any overhauls of existing specs?
[10:07:11] Two_Headed_Raven: do we have a time for diablo release tomorrow?
[10:07:21] nullfront: I'm just excited for the talent calculator man they could just show us that and I'd be happy for like at least a couple of months lol

[10:08:02] SkypexOnline: by features you mean systems?
[10:08:04] GamerKillance: What? Didn't they confirm the price buyout and is finished by december?
[10:08:06] PepeTheFeelsGoodFrog: dragonflight release is about a year away if not more
[10:08:10] WayneG947: Last longer and still released broken

[10:08:15] szeeman62: Serves back up or is towelliee still on EU
[10:08:16] Niksen_99: Probably also the new talent system right
[10:08:27] Wikedlyrics: the MS purchase won't even close before dragonflight comes out, like summer 2023 at earliest
[10:08:31] smokingcactus: still EU
[10:08:32] Toon11: they're redoing all the talent trees, its gonna be nice
[10:08:34] DragonofWolves: Not to mention the talent system revamp and going back to the more classic style
[10:08:42] nullfront: Gotta have their system designers be doing something
[10:08:47] Xsidious: i really hope we get more dungeons and few more raids this expansion

[10:09:03] Niksen_99: Are you excited about the new Talent system or do you like the current one more ?
[10:09:04] neo_0098: I m on 1800 attempts on the Strange Goop in Zereth Mortis. I m starting to doubt it will actually drop lol
[10:09:16] Thunderbrew: I just hope they get it right.
[10:09:20] nullfront: that's a separate team doing raid design, no?
[10:09:25] Jeremy: he said doodoo
[10:09:42] KevnPaik: he did indeed say doodoo
[10:09:51] RPGdegree: i like tauren paladins but i feel like their lore gets scoffed at
[10:09:53] geokouts: 3hours for the EU maintnance
[10:09:58] smokingcactus: @neo_0098 by that time you could have farmed up gold and just bought off AH
[10:10:02] WayneG947: Icyveins on home page again
[10:10:04] mi3f: im just not that excited about dragonriding for some reason... is the purpose to give people flying earlier?
[10:10:08] Darthyrevan: ITS 100% GOINNA BE COOKIECUTTER
[10:10:08] Keyastaron_: i hope we get all the talents atthe end of dragon flight @Towelliee
[10:10:08] Subjektive: im just worried about classes that are not hybrids for talents
[10:10:10] Darthyrevan: caps
[10:10:18] BfAleTitan: there will always be a best option, can't really get away from cookie cutter unfortunately
[10:10:20] Keyastaron_: like get talents from certain things we do in the end game
[10:10:24] Thoreya: I want to see my damn mage talent trees? Reeee
[10:10:25] NameRequired: is the new talent system coming in 9.2.5?
[10:10:30] neo_0098: @smokingcactus nono I m actually farming it to sell it on the auctionhouse
[10:10:32] Thoreya: !**
[10:10:36] Jourdiebear: @NameRequired no
[10:10:39] grendalgaming: is wow up?
[10:10:41] Complete_Phased: I hope with the talents the class tree is gonna be more utility and the spec  tree is gonna be output
[10:10:50] MitssORLY: even with all those talents you will still only play with 3 build raid/mythic/pvp
[10:10:51] smokingcactus: @neo_0098 good luck then :P
[10:11:02] Ziddrax: then where is the fun if we are going to be the same

[10:11:26] Ziddrax: LUL
[10:11:29] Xsidious: towelliee do you know if they are gonna bring back spell buffs for pallys?
[10:11:32] SmarfTV: The fun is more WoW
[10:11:35] nullfront: Is the more flexible utility something to potentially worry about? It might risk putting the classes near a MoP level of homogenization
[10:11:36] ceranac23: @Ziddrax  u will have new tier sets
[10:11:42] WildRagexz: what borrowed power is coming back?

[10:16:59] Broomba: i think there are some who get high and read reddit like the bible @DragonofWolves

[10:36:18] neo_0098: Imagine getting the Dracthyr as a Preorder Bonus haha
[10:36:34] Atruis_: Season 4 is just season 1-3 with a twist
[10:36:34] kampootee: the entire expansion had a drought issue Kappa
[10:36:36] fistofnature: the 9.0 drought was fucking real though, nothing to do except anima farm...
[10:36:37] tebbix: hopefully we get a cool pre patch before dragonflight, I really liked BFA pre patch
[10:36:40] Windnecro: Yeah the new meta achievement is dropping today
[10:36:50] Myndjestyr: if the standard for "new content" is redoing old expansion dungeons than this game is fucked
[10:37:04] Windnecro: For the veilstrider Title. The do a bit of everything achievement like they did for bfa
[10:37:08] Broomba: @towelliee dont forget you have the new SW and GW2 content

[10:37:19] happymope: @Myndjestyr honestly i'd love to see old content come back, it's such a waste all the old stuff is never used
[10:37:37] tebbix: yeah players did ask for it, that was the feedback
[10:37:39] TeejayOCE: I like the idea of it
[10:37:42] manmower: probably tons of players now that didn't even play the content originally
[10:37:44] Myndjestyr: yeah but that shouldnt be a substitute for what could be brand new content
[10:37:44] Moobot: üê≤ S4 WILL NOT BE LAUNCHING WITH 9.2.5! It will be here later this Summer probably after the MDI/AWC Finals. üê≤
[10:37:49] WildRagexz: perserving original content would be nice
[10:37:50] xhale2nhale: I mean ppl have said they wanted old content to be relevant
[10:37:56] Stealinheals: im actually thrilled as i missed the first few raid tiers
[10:38:02] Gingerprimer: It is also very diffrent to do mechagone workshop with the new afffix compared to with awakend and corruptions
[10:38:06] reaprwolf: people like u have been saying this game is fucked for like 12 years now but here we are
[10:38:13] Rexialiton: KEKW

[10:38:29] Grizz_VX: i remember last time i played in like mists people were complaing about the game
[10:38:30] strike879: it was already like that with the wrath timewalk of last week
[10:38:31] Rexialiton: That's what I call wow kids
[10:38:35] ShowDUH: i mean the concept of 4 new and 4 past xpac dungeon is fine
[10:38:48] ShowDUH: most of them we're never done in a m+ setting
[10:38:49] xhale2nhale: tbh ppl don't know what they want, they whine in the forums about this n that and when they listens Blizzard still is damned
[10:38:56] ShowDUH: we could have some insane stuff going
[10:38:58] nullfront: to be fair, dungeons were a lot less relevant back then, I played in mop and I can barely remember those dungeons
[10:39:01] Subjektive: would be cool if they could re-tool some old raids into M+, not the full raid but like maybe the wings of ICC or something
[10:39:13] Nico_vdM: So the NA maintenance has been extended until 1.5 hours from now?
[10:39:18] Stealinheals: m+ rfk inc lol

[10:39:39] ShowDUH: @happymope i mean this we know won't happen it's to rng to time
[10:39:39] xhale2nhale: @happymope don't you put that cancer out in the world
[10:39:42] Windnecro: The season 4 content is really exciting for me because of the relevance of the old mega dungeons. I love kara and the gnome one. And as for the raid this is a low budget way to give people something to mess around with that doesnt delay dragonflight in the way designing an entirely new raid would
[10:39:43] Nico_vdM: RFD will have to be like 4 dungeons
[10:39:52] Toon11: I would love an autoloot system added
[10:40:04] manmower: Karazhan M+ at worst

[10:40:29] Blankelos: i mean scarlet would be cool M+
[10:40:30] egraves7: you know you want BRD teeming fortified
[10:40:31] xhale2nhale: old dungeons have nothing for mechanics
[10:40:32] strike879: only issue i have with the 4 old and 4 new is certain items would take way too long to get
[10:40:33] CrunkyBrewster: I couldn't imagine M+ versions of Deadmines or Scarlet
[10:40:35] Snabido: It would be increased hp and autoattack dmg from mobs, it'll test players' willpower

[11:38:37] Arms_Warrior: have us servers not come up guys? :)
[11:38:38] derangedhippo: They just want people play the game and sink all of there time and money into this.
[11:38:41] itsrambo: @Crunku_ WoW tokens aren't required to gear up your character
[11:38:49] WildRagexz: atleast d3 only had rmah xD
[11:38:49] manmower: 3 months of grinding in an ARPG is a long time
[11:38:57] BfAleTitan: @derangedhippo yea that is the point of making a video game
[11:39:05] Coriollis: imagine having to farm wow gold to inject into immortal LUL
[11:39:12] instant_savage: @HeatherJC83 100% agree
[11:39:17] Nalleys: KEKW
[11:39:21] Moobot: Morpserie, Just for the time being we will be automatically removing any "Pay to Win" comments regardless of context to clean up chat while we play Lost Ark. Sorry for the inconvenience!
[11:39:30] theDirtyon3: this guy is on COPIUM hard LUL
[11:39:31] Molvonos: @Crunku_ You cannot realistically compare WoW token to this without some janky fucking mental gymnastics.
[11:39:33] Rictamar: Lost Ark is pay to yikes garbage, this will be too absolute shambles by Blizz
[11:39:33] griffdog125: lol they not going to change if people are paying
[11:39:39] Armdel: just play, don't think :)
[11:39:41] Morpserie: wat
[11:39:46] manmower: they'll use the money from this game to make their other IPs better OR they'll use it to make more cosmetics and power to sell in Immortal
[11:39:46] BfAleTitan: thats the real copium lol thinking complaining is going to actually lead to change. complaining means your still playing lol
[11:39:52] CrunkyBrewster: Alright alright no need for the shields boys
[11:39:55] Rictamar: game literally dead on arrival KEKW

[11:40:04] Morpserie: diablo immortal: fashion show Pog
[11:40:12] ChadShields: bro its a mobile game its all about the cash shops and PvE content. why are people struggling to cope with this?
[11:40:17] ClassicMalcontent: But it was mathematically possible, albeit improbable, to F2P up in LA. Low low chance. Sounds like it's no chance to reach whale levels in DI unfortunately. It is what it is.
[11:40:17] SpoofAvatar: this guy is not in reality

[11:46:38] realcousineddie: so like any game...wow, very informative .. grind all day and pay money you climb faster and if you dont, you dont .. mind blown
[11:46:45] Mazerbeam: TLDR: People that pay will be better than free-to-play who will be better than people who play and don't play.
[11:46:45] KaisenSiru: Release the Kraken!
[11:46:46] Praetour: @NotEnoughMana people who literally spend hundreds of thousands to millions on these games
[11:46:55] Austei: 8hours a day jeeze

[11:47:34] jkitchin75: ok ill quit working
[11:47:42] Menion01: Imagine being this desperate for a game that you would spend 8hrs a day playing a mobile game.

[11:49:19] mayonaes: Honestly we just want to play the game and enjoy it
[11:49:25] mayonaes: not going for world 1st
[11:49:26] manmower: 8 hours a day are hardcore people
[11:49:29] Mistery836: so uh... what exactly is the problem? isn't this game just a diablo game? or is there pvp or something?
[11:49:29] HeatherJC83: yea im not playhing to compete. lol i don't understand the ppl i wanna be best on server stuff lol
[11:49:31] Short_Film: the key is to make every poop a 8 hour ordeal, play time confirmed!
[11:49:38] athedusgrimwilde: it means they hoard truffles every fall

[11:50:13] XshadowturkeyX: who pvps in arpgs?
[11:50:18] PhatKiwi: Sooooooon
[11:50:22] Coriollis: don't dismiss before u try
[11:50:24] Rictamar: which its not, we shouldn't be supporting a game like this
[11:50:28] Mistery836: as long as you can clear everything as a f2p player I don't care tbh LUL I might spend a tiny amount. but that is it.
[11:50:33] wowking35: is na up?
[11:50:34] Praetour: @JiveDude I'm pretty sure just for launch
[11:50:35] CardinalTX: Tiger is that you?
[11:50:40] vadermug: i mean if you need 35 more hrs a week than the "lazy whale" that is significant
[11:50:48] abracka_: we're 20 minutes away from the estimated time servers will be up, what's going on blizz talk to us
[11:50:50] JiveDude: I need to work during the day

[11:51:05] GamerKillance: RIP Blizzard announced its extended maintenance @Towelliee
[11:51:12] galinhoo: The graph he showed didnt seemed balanced
[11:51:15] Talk_Nerdy_2Me: once again PVP ruins a game
[11:51:18] Menion01: It's not the same. You can earn everything in Lost Ark over time. Immortal has things you HAVE to spend money on to get.
[11:51:24] LunarTidesMusic: @abracka_ they want their pre order to go smooth, so its taking more time.
[11:51:29] healmore49: Lol

[11:52:07] Grizz_VX: @Praetour lmao right
[11:52:09] XshadowturkeyX: people did that to people that got the tbcc mount

[11:54:48] GameingAspect: i hope they dident
[11:54:52] JackelxD: why do people think that pve side of things, especially against whales, is such a competition? They turn the game into a job.
