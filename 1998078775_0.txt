[3:53:22] Radund01: @uwuphoria it would have been a great game if it did not run like shit.  Like thoroughly enjoyed the region
[3:53:32] uwuphoria: @Radund01 same
[3:53:38] uwuphoria: i got the shiny charm
[3:53:53] uwuphoria: first in my friend group to get it in fact
[3:54:16] Radund01: fights were great, catching was great, pacing was what you made it.  I would also love it if they added difficulty setting the makes wild pokemon harder/higher level.
[3:55:08] Radund01: The giant mon fights were soooooo fun.  The gym battles were underwhelming but the bad guy fights were insanely good.
[3:55:11] uwuphoria: people have been making PC version of pokemon for as long as they could. and there is a reason for that. cause PC players want a fucking pokemon game KEKW
[3:55:16] uwuphoria: they would make so much money

[3:55:56] cephaspottery: have you tried moonstone island? @CobaltStreak
[3:56:02] Radund01: I loved the Scarlet.  But optimization was terrible the actual content was an amazing step forward for Pokemon

[3:56:40] Norburger: moonstone is a card battle/farm sim
[3:56:52] Radund01: @Centurion_Havoc I think that was gen 4 was it not?
[3:56:56] ReefPirates: have you tried pokemon infinite fusion
[3:57:02] uwuphoria: @Radund01 would have been that much better had it not ran like shit. tho i know they optimized it later
[3:57:14] Centurion_Havoc: @Radund01 meant LoA
[3:57:25] uwuphoria: @ReefPirates not yet but it was on my list
