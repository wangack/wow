[1:41:54] Heero_Effect: @shiftfazed MMPGA?
[1:42:15] iDeez88: i like the bell comment of making affixes buffs, where if you do mechanics, its easier to time, and without doing it, its hard to time +3/2 etc... the more you do, the more you time, the less you do, the less you time, and no drawbacks to not doing a mechanic

[1:44:34] JakeDaaSnake: Evoker looks sick
[1:44:38] smashwow: yeah but SBG and COS beign the most ran isn't because they're old. it's because they're stupid easy

[1:45:56] smashwow: HOV is pretty punishing as an old dungeon
[1:46:00] Shiz_zap: evoker is so fun just wish you had more xmog
[1:46:59] xHukk: HOV is kinda of cake imo.
[1:47:04] JakeDaaSnake: This dh pumps, what a beast
[1:47:15] xrandomdoodx: the older dungeons feel more fun than the newer ones by far. I like to focus on doing better dps through rotation mastery rather than worrying about 10 and dispels kicks per minute lol
[1:47:16] Fortvila: HoV is hard numberwise, but not so much going on u cannot easly fgocus on affixes
[1:47:20] Mecabeast: Hov gets really difficult to 3 chest
[1:47:48] PvtHudson093: Mortal Flesh
[1:48:03] smashwow: 2nd boss for a healer on tyrannical week is just death if they're not a "good" healer. keeping in mind i'm talking 20+'s

[1:54:26] smashwow: lol they're giving you the neck now so you have the bis neck for next tier LUL
[1:54:48] xrandomdoodx: @Towelliee Focusing on doing more dps/heals is way more fun than tedious kicks and dispels, which involve not hitting your dps buttons.
[1:54:52] rosina_scarlett: yw yw. I also don't think HoV would be bad if they didn't lower the timer by 7 mins
[1:54:57] xrandomdoodx: I want mechanics to be very deadly and punishing if you fail them, but have them be well telegraphed imo.
[1:55:09] Mecabeast: Don't forget to use a catalyst charge before reset tomorrow
[1:55:28] qbabattoir: that‚Äôs good tho

[2:03:52] biirrd: 2012 for D3 and 2013 for poe
[2:04:04] medanmarko: PoE came out in Jan 2012 D3 came out in May. D3 Reaper of Souls introduced Nephalem Rifts are a gameplay feature of Diablo III: Reaper of Souls.
[2:04:14] DunzoCD: rifts came out with reaper of souls no?
[2:04:20] intimidation_MD: inital releases have poe a few months post D3, but Poe's alpha was june 2010
[2:04:20] ytsidilas: poe has rly great endgame

[2:04:28] Shrenko: the map system blew my last braincells out
[2:04:47] asmodai4823: poe is definetly not a normie game
[2:04:53] intimidation_MD: yes, rifts came out after the s**tshow that was D3 launch... who remembers the bee's from a2?!
[2:04:58] ytsidilas: imagine seeing the new map tallent tree :P
[2:05:21] medanmarko: You are right. No counter-argument there and I'm a die-hard PoE fan :D
[2:05:24] MereMortal: PoE has depth
[2:05:31] Karbonn: When you are new and open PoE's map of talents and get your face pushed in, you wonder if this is that game for you lol.
[2:05:32] DunzoCD: PoE keeps old content in the game so its got so much to do and learn
[2:05:32] asmodai4823: poe is other side of spectrum to d3
[2:05:33] intimidation_MD: agreed.  I get bored of D3 after a few months.  the grind wasn't difficult enough
[2:05:50] Shrenko: Zizaran has the best league starter builds to follow imo
[2:05:56] Davedaman26: should take a look at The Lords of the Fallen that's coming out this year

[2:06:06] ytsidilas: poe has a lot of cookie cutter builds
[2:06:11] dalgress: whats that m+ addon that shows the m+ rating beside the group name
[2:06:13] ytsidilas: but you need to research them
[2:06:21] asmodai4823: well poe is bigger than d3 but diablo as a whole has more mindshare
[2:06:39] Vonrus: Man, these kids must not know about streamer privilege SMH'ing my head
[2:07:00] Liquid_Mix: I agree I dont like how it ramps up in options and difficulty i feel lost at points. on the subject of poe.
[2:07:05] Dcarter: Hard to get random invites unless you around 2800 now
[2:07:09] HaxzorJimDuggan: poe2 seems like it may simplify some things
[2:07:15] Shrenko: that guy only invites Kungen
[2:07:17] HooDGorE: IO score is worse than gear score was in wrath
[2:07:22] fenivath: the state of M+ community is horrible rn
[2:07:40] HooDGorE: IO made pugging miserable
[2:07:56] asmodai4823: poe is basically same age
[2:07:56] smol_gunner: ilvl doesnt mean jack shit for pugs, with crafting + valor, every demon alt is 418ilvl in no time
[2:08:02] MereMortal: Lol, no
[2:08:03] asmodai4823: nah poe lasts way longer
[2:08:04] ytsidilas: depends on the season
[2:08:06] sdpercussion: why not run your own key and invite stream?
[2:08:10] ytsidilas: the new league in poe rocks
[2:08:10] MereMortal: PoE is 1-2 months for most
[2:08:12] DunzoCD: poe is usually poppin the first month then it drops off
[2:08:13] asmodai4823: d3 dies after a week
[2:08:16] DeleldurTV: Thats because m+ is harder now by design then it was in shadowlands, so randoms don't want to even risk bringing someone that don't "preform"
[2:08:24] Shrenko: same thing will happen with D4 seasons

[2:09:08] JimKappa420: ask panda that drop key she will give you new one
[2:09:09] Shrenko: is it even worth doing a key? chances of getting an upgrade on your warrior is like 5% maybe LUL
[2:09:14] Macrodotz: im new to dragonflight can you explain crafting plz
[2:09:15] smol_gunner: speaking of being declined, you think ppl decline you coz you are a streamer and they dont want the extra pressure?

[2:09:51] stratiss: no it's because when you queue up for easy keys there are 100's of other applicants
[2:09:53] asmodai4823: youre competing with tanks 2800+ who just want an easy key for week
[2:10:05] Dcarter: It‚Äôs his score
[2:10:09] stratiss: ^^

[2:13:28] happybooger: im sure Blizz has that data
[2:13:29] Macrodotz: io scoring ruined it

[2:14:13] ScottySlays: same thing in LFR raids, we wipe someone leaves. Like its an LFR raid for a reason, we are their to learn. I was blessed to have someone teach me. I also swap to DPS cause tanking is tough in an LFR raid. I just didnt understand it
[2:14:14] Mecabeast: Dungeons completed after time expired might be filterable
[2:14:19] PhatyBoy: There should penalties for people leaving
[2:14:33] Karbonn: People have less tolerance for failing in anything in any game it seems. Feel like it started a year ago or more.

[2:17:31] Shrenko: well I would think only the ''meta people'' are doing 20's
[2:17:32] xrandomdoodx: its totally unnecessary for 20's and lower to play meta also
[2:17:34] Dcarter: The dungeons in season 2 are fucking awful
[2:17:46] MereMortal: I'm tellin' ya, it's WoW's version of Greater Rifts. That shallow end game shit doesn't keep people.

[2:21:08] iDeez88: What if you could turn off an affix for the week, but it also caps your +key. Like completely remove grievous from your key, but you can only +2 it now
[2:22:04] MereMortal: @adoroladys Yeah, that's what it's become unfortunately. Once I likened M+ to Greater Rifts, I all but quit. Sad as I love WoW but the "infinite end game" is lame.

[2:22:59] daGawdT: thoughts on jon bones?!'
[2:23:47] D3CMON: I can't believe Valentina lost there was a super big upset
[2:24:08] MereMortal: @ZealotryTV That would definitely get folks interested imo, even I'm interested. The infinite grind plus more negatives(affixes) just gets old.
[2:24:19] rosina_scarlett: 13-14 min runs
[2:24:31] WoW_StandalonE: for me, the game is this: get curve and KSM, unsubscribe,  come back next season, rinse and repeat
[2:24:32] JakeDaaSnake: they pull all the trash into this boss, and during the phase they all go dormat lol
[2:24:50] Mecabeast: Idk if anything was faster than the 12.75min rlp echo did

[2:28:25] asmodai4823: no one
[2:28:33] Angrybubble: thanks ^_^
[2:28:41] theDirtyon3: what FF fan siad that? KEKW

[2:29:21] zinbers: Why
[2:29:21] zarod89: Liquid and such could probably do it now
[2:29:23] smol_gunner: @theDirtyon3 man, CE has little to no meaning nowdays, fukin 3000 guilds get it per tier, not to mention you can buy it, from like week 2

[2:30:17] asmodai4823: @theDirtyon3 CE is pretty irrelevent hes right
[2:30:25] smol_gunner: @theDirtyon3 go to wowprogress and check it yourself
[2:30:39] zarod89: external raidlead would just use external timers haha
[2:31:05] warrenny: @asmodai4823 Dumb take
[2:31:25] theDirtyon3: no shot some people in twitch chat are saying its irrelevant LUL
[2:31:31] theDirtyon3: actually no shot
[2:31:32] theDirtyon3: KEKW
[2:31:39] asmodai4823: @warrenny nah CE is doable by 2 day guilds pretty easy by end of tier
[2:31:51] asmodai4823: @theDirtyon3 you clearly dont raid
[2:31:59] theDirtyon3: @asmodai4823 that your logic? KEKW
[2:31:59] Vadagar1: This boss the easiest of the Mythic+ dungeons?
[2:32:01] warrenny: @asmodai4823 Doesnt mean its irrelevant
[2:32:03] theDirtyon3: bruh
[2:32:16] asmodai4823: i can tell
[2:32:19] smol_gunner: your reaction makes me thing you never actually got a CE @theDirtyon3
[2:32:30] asmodai4823: @warrenny i mean noone cares
[2:32:34] theDirtyon3: please link your CE then @smol_gunner @asmodai4823
[2:32:46] asmodai4823: want my HOF?
[2:32:50] zarod89: baiting the breath in transition on Ras
[2:32:56] Molvonos: Such a broad statement.  'No one cares'.
[2:33:04] warrenny: @thedirtyon3 They dont even have curve
[2:33:07] theDirtyon3: LUL
[2:33:17] smol_gunner: which tier do you want, got all of them since I started raiding in Legion  @theDirtyon3
[2:33:35] asmodai4823: its hilarious lol
[2:33:43] theDirtyon3: @smol_gunner link your bnet then
[2:33:48] asmodai4823: CE is not a big deal because the raid is nerfed by the end
[2:34:00] asmodai4823: so alot of ppl get it

[2:34:07] zinbers: I was just thinking I know a lot of wow players would not do it but a man can dream just to see if it possible
[2:34:07] WoW_StandalonE: mythic raiding is mostly about time allocation the less skills you have, the more time you need.
[2:34:07] theDirtyon3: these takes KEKW
[2:34:12] theDirtyon3: 'alot'
[2:34:29] asmodai4823: SEE

[4:49:03] thejangoshow: At one point a few mond before DF, tokens were like 90k on NA lol it was the best @Towelliee
[4:49:05] dracullus: @Towelliee wait for closed beta, people will use gold to buy D4
[4:49:07] Masqerader: token will drop before d4 launch again most likely

[5:19:09] Greybeard_ttv: Exactly
[5:19:25] DrakeDuude: i agree
[5:19:27] PvtHudson093: the dragonflight CE mount should be a DF riding mount
[5:19:33] ragidala: agree
[5:19:35] Hitokiri83: id be happy even if just exisiting drake mounts were dragonriding
[5:19:42] Strange_Inquiries: I think they should just rework all the drake mounts and keep it actual dragonriding
[5:19:43] deadman385: I have the need,,,the need for speed
[5:19:46] yenaffit71: Me too; took the time to get those mounts, should be able to use them any time
[5:19:49] james_bah: they should make the dragon riding mounts behave like normal mounts outside dragon isles
[5:19:51] xHukk: agreed.  I don't like it
[5:19:56] TheGiant99: Yea even having the mount skin it's getting old to look at
