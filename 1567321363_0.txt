[0:56:57] wEiRdO_dUdE: Yeah it seems like our current gear will last a looooong time
[0:57:24] Hildring: jailer gavel bis 1st tier? :P
[0:58:01] akia03: or they just bump up the itemlvl of the rewards maybe they didnt incorperate the s4 itemlvl increase in alpha yet
[0:58:29] wEiRdO_dUdE: I guess it did feel bad to replace purples with quest gear too fast, in other expansions
[1:00:03] barktwo: Also have to keep in mind people who level 1-70, they don't exactly stop at 60 to do shadowlands stuff so you'll be 150-ish at 60 I guess.
[1:00:04] wEiRdO_dUdE: It's like I would give them credit for fighting item level bloat, but then I see pieces of gear at 389 ilvl

[1:57:37] smol_gunner: I'd bet 100$ Ian is gonna lawyers his way out of it not being account wide, making it seem like its a vital part of replay experience
[1:57:45] DiiscoViking: logging now
[1:57:55] MightyWombat: they gotta leave some heavy grind in the game probly why its not account wide :p
[1:58:00] headshot_hunter6: holy shit, the changes they are making to unholy DK are frikin awesome!
[1:58:28] Quakezilla69: I feel like it would be a check system, If yes, then open. I know its more complicated then that
[1:58:43] MightyWombat: danCopium
[1:58:48] agentblaster123: @headshot_hunter6 what changes?
[1:59:13] Sephirothxz: The point is having a Main has always been a huge part of wow the difference from main and alts always existed. Having everything on every character destroy that difference and fotm reroller will be all over the place.
[1:59:19] Nahzdro: i mean they could use an item that you use on alts like the one that put you renown 60, they already proved it possible
[1:59:41] headshot_hunter6: @agentblaster123 https://www.wowhead.com/news/upcoming-death-knight-talent-tree-changes-on-dragonflight-alpha-328433
[1:59:56] Tiamarilien: I hate grinding rep on alts, I've been wanting acct wide rep for years. Sadly rl is more difficult than just me wishing, lol
[2:00:02] Nahzdro: yeah its a bandaid for sure
[2:00:24] Zenbali97: or make it accountwide but make gains limited, so that you dont cheese progress
[2:00:45] Dashuria: they could make checkpoints with acc wide, maybe not max but every like 10
[2:00:47] luckfore: reeee
[2:00:56] smol_gunner: is that what ur describing a technical limitation or just a design decision?
[2:01:05] EpicMonkeyFailzGaming: @akaar that kinda defeats the purpose imho

[2:01:50] Zenbali97: @mrepicmonkeyfailz13 what i meant was, if you tie renown to WQ make that WQ not repeatable by every character
[2:01:59] Zenbali97: or else progression would be a joke
[2:02:04] Dashuria: @mrepicmonkeyfailz13 not really, it makes you focus on what you need to do on alts and main, instead of doing grinding
[2:02:23] Dashuria: on alts
[2:02:29] Literae: @Towelliee I always thought they didnt want Account Wide stuff like Rep and Renown so that you had to redo it on your alts and spend more time in the game. Hence more game time. However the opposite happened and people didnt like it = Less Game Time
[2:02:37] warrenny: This the 3rd zone?
[2:02:39] manmower: make renown accountwide so you can work the progress on any toon
[2:02:50] warrenny: @manmower Yes
[2:02:57] flebbooo: The downside of that 2004 engine unfortuante

[2:04:24] warrenny: People are more entitled now tho
[2:04:44] Literae: @warrenny Yeah thats what I mean why they "didnt" want it, in the past etc
[2:04:50] manmower: people were pissed their alts could no longer keep up, not enough time in the day
[2:04:52] SpyCrabbo: they said they wanted more things to be account wide this expac, but what have they actually changed?

[2:05:13] kyr_slowbro: KEKW
[2:05:25] Thoreya: isnt the dragonriding talent shit account wide
[2:05:29] SlippieSlik: Does it feel weird in DF to not have a "borrowed power" system yet.
[2:05:39] Literae: "if they have to re do the content, they will spend more time in the game" LUL
[2:05:49] Sephirothxz: It they dont make account wide things people wont redo all the farming and grinding and actually quit. If they gives account wide things people will be done in a pair of weeks and actually quit. Some people will quit anyway doesnt matter the systems.
[2:06:20] Literae: Levelling my "account" is more of the gameplay style we have evolved into now. Building a character was old school MMORPG
[2:06:30] SeroVinoGG: Does prot warrior still feel OP from the last dungeon video you made?
[2:06:39] Tiamarilien: No borrowed power sounds great, but it's been awhile since blizz did that
[2:07:01] hippieh8rlol: people loved Lost Ark's shared progression for alts as well. blizzard is usually good at noticing new systems people like
[2:07:02] SpyCrabbo: don't you just get all the dragonriding talents while leveling by collecting the glyphs? account wide doesn't sound like much of a feature there
[2:07:37] warrenny: S4 gear is gonna last that long?
[2:07:43] Literae: @SpyCrabbo Dragonriding is the feature, account wide is the change.
[2:07:47] manmower: endgame photographer
[2:07:57] Artiiz: Do you think pre-patch gear will be better?
[2:08:14] im_capy: took less than a day to get max renowned, 230 ilvl with a alt in SL, once you do it one time through with main
[2:08:17] warrenny: @artiiz 280 ish maybe
[2:08:30] aleksmetha: why?
[2:08:55] Literae: If they delay, we all get annual sub for free Kappa
[2:08:56] valth: i still say it will come out in Nov
[2:08:57] luckfore: damn
[2:08:59] aleksmetha: cause of law stuff
[2:08:59] Polebegood: so it's coming out whether it's finished or not, nice
[2:09:04] matching_towels: cost to keep contracts on too
[2:09:07] Thoreya: its coming out nov imo
[2:09:12] matching_towels: contractors*
[2:09:15] Artiiz: @Polebegood They've said that they are further ahead than expected though
[2:09:19] mayonaes: thats fine though
[2:09:20] arcaniia007: i would like that tbh
[2:09:23] Thoreya: i will stand by it until they announce the date
[2:09:32] SeroVinoGG: You think that leak of Oct pre patch is total BS or could happen?
[2:09:32] warrenny: @arcaniia007 Same
[2:09:38] Uutef: they've done that before
[2:09:40] wEiRdO_dUdE: Delaying the opening of the raid sounds plausible
[2:09:43] im_capy: they didn't make raids for last patch of SL, that effort and "content" was pushed into DF
[2:09:52] Rhuidan: who is "he"?
[2:09:54] Quakezilla69: id rather a normal release schedule
[2:09:55] aleksmetha: 8 bosses right?
[2:09:57] szble: if its done its done
[2:10:05] Quakezilla69: dont delay because of a silly holiday
[2:10:13] luckfore: but then it doesnt matter if it comes out a week before christmas
[2:10:18] Thoreya: @szble yup. they aint gonna delay shit just because  LUL
[2:10:22] Thoreya: too much $ to be made
[2:10:45] Literae: Release broken, fixed content = DLC Kappa
[2:10:48] aleksmetha: good number :)
[2:10:57] mrrazputin: what is that eye icon next to bags ?
[2:11:09] mrelgaato: LFG
[2:11:36] Quakezilla69: even from heroic standpoint, it didnt need to be that hard
[2:11:39] Pandaec: Wait never do what
[2:11:43] mrelgaato: Not an eye of the Jailer=)
[2:11:45] im_capy: focused so much on raiding and M+, forgot about the other 90% of the player base
[2:11:49] manmower: raid too long
[2:11:51] warrenny: Sepulcher was great
[2:11:59] tulsaboom: @mrrazputin its groupfinder symbol

[2:12:16] Sicknessqt: Long raids are boring
[2:12:17] Orion280: if they can't delay the expac i hope they aren't crunching or anything or super stressed
[2:12:18] Literae: Why should a raid be quick though?

[2:29:59] anderlukee: these zones look so good
[2:30:02] TheCliffyShow: The Elite of the dragon aspects. Alexstraza is Kenny Omega, and the other two are the Young Bucks.
[2:30:13] velissaro: how are you finding the new UI?
[2:30:14] RmysYolo: Wrathion is not there because obviously he is behind argus, jailer and old gods LUL

[2:31:36] DavidBrutal123: how good is the new ui, do you see maybe winning over elvui?
[2:31:44] Artiiz: so the great vault is not changing?
[2:31:50] Thoreya: hmmmmmmmmmmm
[2:31:59] Thoreya: should be a bit bigger no?
[2:32:08] Thoreya: i was thinkin some crazy dragon vault
[2:32:46] MercurialPTDR: it was indeed
[2:32:50] Thoreya: i mean def better than what we had in bfa
[2:32:58] Armdel: better than the old weekly chest for sure
[2:33:13] pumperDink: yea, more likely to get gear you need
[2:33:17] flebbooo: Yeah i got no issues with the vault tbh, always things to improve like when they changed it from needing 10 dungeons to 8 for 3 rewards
[2:33:22] velissaro: shouldn't offer you items you already have unless higher iL
[2:33:49] Thoreya: they really need a raid vendor like they have for valor and conquest imo
[2:33:54] Armdel: atleast then you can get socket slots
[2:34:10] Shubwub: Is the gear from the vault slot-exclusive? E.g. you can't get 2 shoulders?
[2:34:19] pringlez91: wow dragonflight will be the king of mmo in2023
[2:34:33] Zenbali97: @Towelliee  it's a shame tho you can only upgrade through Raid Tokens
[2:34:37] Molvonos: @Shubwub Nope.  You can get six kinds of rings if there are six kinds of rings.
[2:34:59] Thoreya: @pringlez91 2022 and 2023
[2:35:16] zenkodac: yea the two systems compliment themselves pretty well with what crafting is also gona fill next expac i'm expecting people to able to be within a reasonable goal of their bis in1 month pretty consistently
[2:35:45] RmysYolo: what u think of new live action house changes?
[2:35:52] nvnto: 30k tip monkaS

[2:36:50] Vetyst: wait so, you dont bring in your own materials for work orders? The one taking the order upon themselves brings them?
[2:37:34] Kale_Nd: it's 5 crafted not just boes, so even the mythic ones count towards the 5
[2:37:40] isuran__: Mornin everyone!

[2:38:54] Toshnab: Toshnab subscribed with Prime. 
[2:39:22] Literae: End Game Crafters = Retired raiders Kappa
[2:39:40] SwazzTv: Do you automatically get flying in this expansion or is it an achievement that is earned like the last few expansions
[2:39:58] School_Toilets: I'd like Legion emissary back for the pleb
[2:40:02] Molvonos: @SwazzTv You get Dragonflying through your first few quests - regular flying isn't possible atm.
[2:40:21] TheCliffyShow: How much dragonriding mount customization have you unlocked while leveling?
[2:40:23] Thoreya: whats our predictions on when dragonflying will be available anywhere in wow
[2:40:36] Nytaha: Nytaha subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 36 months! towUwu
[2:40:42] kraydom: How does one go about finding a Mythic Raiding Service?
[2:41:04] Jarlan23: it'll depend on if its worth it. you might not make your money back on reagents if a mythic carry is 10+ million
[2:41:11] Strouss: Weird question... Am i the only one who likes the fan blowing on them summer and winter?
[2:41:30] KaisenSiru: anniesWrite
[2:41:33] Jarlan23: @Strouss nope i have a fan on all year round
[2:41:39] Jarlan23: but i just like the noise
[2:41:46] MisterSpoooky: Towelie you gonna play wotlk classic?
[2:41:49] PrimalRain: Strouss you're never the only one for anything ;p
[2:41:59] Quakezilla69: be cool if they did
[2:42:04] c0mmander_starscream: COming soon in the year of 20AoC
[2:42:13] Literae: @Strouss GF sleeps with fan on face all year around, 2 fans in summer and heating and fan in winter LUL
[2:42:15] Strouss: @PrimalRain lol true
[2:42:19] Dashuria: does the dragon have a little stun or anything if you just crash it with the ground on maximum momentum?
[2:42:26] Molvonos: Different animations.
[2:42:33] MercurialPTDR: I think they're looking into it, think they mentioned it somewhere
[2:42:38] Moobot: No need to repeat yourself, @TheCliffyShow (warning)
[2:42:44] Shubwub: thankfully a lot of mounts share the same rig so it might not be tooo tricky
[2:42:55] brian_777777777: minus 10 raid tiers
[2:43:02] Literae: Flying mounts killed ground mounts Kappa
[2:43:21] Sicknessqt: buff other mounts too LUL
[2:43:22] theoriginalzinng: Hmm so i see you made it past azure span quests. My character I was working on is stuck on a bugged final quest of the zone I think
[2:43:23] Strouss: i was gonna say can they put in a thing where you can teach your other flying mounts to be like the DF ones?
[2:43:25] MightyWombat: well if you wanna afk for a bit while you travel to where your going :p
[2:43:27] brian_777777777: would be nice to have some more game in my game
[2:43:30] TheCliffyShow: I think the Dragonflight Epic Edition green dragon mount should work with dragonriding.
[2:43:43] gritbarontv: they should just let ground mounts climb up walls
[2:44:19] Quakezilla69: green proto
[2:44:19] Adryandwave: Because the downside of Dragon Riding isthat u have to actively fly and interact with it, with normal flying mounts you can just afk fly and not think about it, but the downside is you'll go slower
[2:44:23] MisterSpoooky: time lost
[2:44:24] Mushythegoblin: bronze
[2:44:31] MisterSpoooky: LOL
[2:44:33] Shrugal: Idk, the other mounts just need a few animations
[2:44:38] mrelgaato: proto form Uldum
[2:44:39] TheCliffyShow: Red Drake from Wyrmrest rep.
[2:44:42] nvnto: these models are so old, i wouldnt even wanna sit on those, if we got those new model Kappa
[2:44:51] Promilie: We know theyve given the dragonriding animations to standard drake models
[2:44:53] luckfore: just make all mounts 900% too
[2:44:56] Jarlan23: more than a co uple
[2:44:59] Shubwub: but the only share like 10 rigs
[2:45:00] Strouss: flying rat would be weird in DF lol
[2:45:07] MercurialPTDR: pretty much most are reskins
[2:45:14] Jarlan23: i wanna see dragonriding on the darkmoon zepplin
[2:45:14] finejeez1: i just roll with mimrons head
[2:45:19] Molvonos: Or the Mage Disk
[2:45:21] positive_ions: just make Ll
[2:45:24] Literae: Dragonriding capstone = All drakes/dragons
[2:45:35] TheCliffyShow: Or the engineer-made helicopter mounts from BC.
[2:45:50] Literae: Ray D Tear from WOD Garrison? :D
[2:46:00] flebbooo: At that point just do player housing instead KEKW
[2:46:02] Thoreya: why does everything have to cost us a raid tier reeee LUL
[2:46:09] Thoreya: they needa put those 100 new devs into work
[2:46:13] awesomeness_inc: @Towelliee i want it. i don't raid anyway. but every1 will use dragonflying
[2:46:20] Strouss: Towel isnt wrong tho.
[2:46:22] LeXieSterling: Good morning. How's the testing going?
[2:46:38] Sollice: Well maybe with bringing in those 100 devs they will be able to do more without losing a raid tier
[2:46:38] Jollywhompus: How long in the expac do you think prof gear will be relevent?
[2:46:41] TheCliffyShow: So, you can get to those pet battles sooner.
[2:46:42] Mayhem_George: @Thoreya Good question. Since the company is not small and their budget also is not small :D
[2:46:48] Sollice: Let them get the launch on their belt and go from there
[2:46:52] Literae: I still think Soar should have no CD in Dragon Isles and only in Azeroth
[2:46:58] kyr_slowbro: Work on Casual Content
[2:47:00] Thoreya: @Mayhem_George exactly LUL
[2:47:06] Wicksom: Wicksom subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 53 months! 
[2:47:16] Sollice: move them all to D4 and bring out the gam enow
[2:47:28] c0mmander_starscream: Cant wait for Microsoft to start cleaning house
[2:47:35] mrelgaato: @Sollice truth dot com
[2:47:40] MercurialPTDR: @Sollice aye
[2:47:50] Thoreya: i think i heard they actually really enjoy the wow dev team
[2:47:53] Sollice: So hyped for D4
[2:47:55] Mayhem_George: Is this expansion time gated progress wise like shadowlands story and legion artifact weapons leveling ?
[2:47:59] Thoreya: so hopefully a lot of them stay
[2:48:02] nalright: pala tank its just loved and satisfaction
[2:48:25] Ultimate_CD3: probably
[2:48:25] Shubwub: a lot of devs will quit when they get bought by other companies as it's just now who they want to work for
[2:48:30] jojoman12: you can
[2:48:31] rHinosYth: prob also depends on the employees contract
[2:48:31] Sollice: No they are all under contract
[2:48:44] Sollice: Plus I am sure they had outs because they would have had to move
[2:48:44] Moobot: towHAMUP Follow Towelliee on twitter so you can be in the know at all times! | twitter.com/towelthetank towKawaii
[2:48:51] Shubwub: not all will be contracted
[2:48:52] Literae: They would have some sort of deal too their end. "We are moving companies, if you want to keep your job, you have to move across, or you can leave with payout" or something
[2:48:54] rHinosYth: you would think
[2:48:55] ArcaneMaki: They can leave whenever they want.
[2:49:05] skymercii: Hey @Towelliee what is your opinion on this: people are complaining that it's taking blizz so long to draw up the dh tree but dh only been around since legion so I feel like they starting from scratch on it.... can't pull stuff from like wod Wrath MoP or classic like with other classes
[2:49:09] c0mmander_starscream: RIOT games
[2:49:10] TheCliffyShow: Especially after 2021.
[2:49:10] jordanshy: wassup
[2:49:11] gritbarontv: smart move will get another contract or move on, you are at will employee.
[2:49:14] kyr_slowbro: Girls are probably scared to work there unfort
[2:49:16] notColt45: You usually make sure senior management stays on, and under them will stay because they like the manager. But it's at-will work so most can quit I would think
[2:49:19] Jollywhompus: I dont think people realize it takes 2 to 4 years to start to see any change in a company once acquired
[2:49:34] theoriginalzinng: I haven‚Äôt encountered anything timegated yet that gives any form of player power
[2:49:40] Quakezilla69: jsut delete DHs and give me lock Meta back
[2:49:42] Sollice: If your under contract it's no simple to say you can leave whatever you want. Most of the contracts are going to have a non compete in it
[2:49:44] theoriginalzinng: All grinds so far are completely optional
[2:49:48] Literae: "Not true, Aimed shot was in Vanilla" LUL
[2:49:48] Aquadriel: they are not, they just need 10 nodes for their 123 KEKW
[2:49:53] Molvonos: Let me talent into a THIRD jump PLEASE KTHX
[2:49:57] Aquadriel: 10 nodes of 6 points each and GG
[2:50:02] ZetYokai: you timed how long is 60-70 yet?
[2:50:09] Thoreya: im telling you watch DH have the sickest trees LUL
[2:50:21] Molvonos: @ZetYokai towSweat
[2:50:22] CruzM8: gotta make sure their 3 button rotations work properly lmfao
[2:50:23] Mitchiegan: have they said or shown what the specializations of engineer are going to be?
[2:50:28] velissaro: maybe they'll get bloodlet back
[2:50:30] notColt45: LUL 1 point just so you can jump
[2:50:39] Dashuria: inb4 half of the tree is just eye beam stuff LUL
[2:50:40] Literae: The one I hope from DH is "Eye Beam summons another DH" Kreygasm love that Lego/Torghast
[2:50:45] Mayhem_George: I hope they don't time gate the game again like they did in shadowlands and Legion
[2:50:46] MercurialPTDR: you're saying it like people are complaining without a reason
[2:50:54] Mitchiegan: thank you, I'll go watch it
[2:51:08] StayAtHomeBrad77: Are you able to resize the maps and quest logs screen?
[2:51:11] MercurialPTDR: most trees are horribly designed
[2:51:12] Quakezilla69: I havent watched yet, and I plan too. But quick TLDR, do you think engineering will be nice?

[2:51:22] ArcaneMaki: So, do you think we'll ever see a Tinker class make it into wow someday @Towelliee .
[2:51:23] MercurialPTDR: Priest always suffering :(
[2:51:23] Thoreya: @MercurialPTDR what trees?
[2:51:26] skymercii: i saw some datamine that wowhead did that kyrian sigil and the hunt
[2:51:43] skymercii: @MercurialPTDR i heavily disagree
[2:51:49] AlodirTim: stop play dh reroll enhancer cuz blizz is to slow XD
[2:51:53] theoriginalzinng: I have a feeling DH will have quite a few torghast powers in their talents which could make it good
[2:51:55] ArcaneMaki: XD
[2:52:04] Literae: Look at it this way DH, Hunter was one of the first, but still not "ready" LUL (I know they all arent ready until live, but you know what I mean with the amount of weekly changes)
[2:52:13] Mayhem_George: and still after that DH was so strong in arena especially, which made it unfair for classes that are around since the classic. They seemed so underpowered compared to the DH class
[2:52:40] MercurialPTDR: tbf shammy looks really good
[2:52:40] moa285: Kappa
[2:52:42] Speedglass: WoW needs a wishing well where you can swipe your credit card in-game
[2:52:43] ArcaneMaki: I just wish they would make a Tinker class out of mechs and for gnomes and goblins only.
[2:52:49] theoriginalzinng: It‚Äôs also still alpha, settle down edgy boys
[2:53:01] Quakezilla69: mage is dumpster ass

[2:53:02] Thoreya: hunter gets 100 changes, mage gets 0
[2:53:04] Jarlan23: warrior changes every week

[2:53:47] mavericks312: make mages great again
[2:53:52] Molvonos: Mages natural state of being is whining about their class.  It's a requirement.
[2:53:54] Jarlan23: funny you say that LUL max said warriors are one of the quietest people

[2:54:25] AlodirTim: is there a way too create a weakaura too see enemy debuff like flameshock? yes  but only aplied by myself? so i dont see this weakaura if another shaman is using flameshock? etc. maybe in 40guys world boss? its realy misleading

[2:54:50] zysmos: Oh boy
[2:54:51] Molvonos: Boomies can be in the trash beside their mage brothers.
[2:54:57] MercurialPTDR: that spot is for spriest
[2:55:01] AveragePvp: I want DH to be the worst and Boomkins can be slightly ahead LUL
[2:55:01] facerolljack: @Towelliee that should be clipped and sent to tettles KEKW

[2:55:41] Literae: "I want it now" community mentality. Alpha = Early access and everyone should have access to it apparently. Then complain there is nothing todo when the game releases because they explored everything in Alpha/Beta.

[3:29:43] Sollice: lol
[3:29:45] Mayhemz95: @hwiyo think it might be around 100g, i use the g502 and its 121g, so might just use the kone for everything
[3:29:46] Mushythegoblin: i can barely reach the the buttons on the top of th mouse without lifting my bloody arm
[3:29:47] suvati68: Is it good
[3:29:47] Youredoneson666: I'd be curious to see the program it uses
[3:29:52] MercurialPTDR: it is basic :D
[3:29:53] c0mmander_starscream: And it's also available on Gamepass
[3:29:53] Skyymarshal: Its a Naga
[3:29:53] Sollice: YO THIS AMAZON BASIC MOUSE LOOKS BASIC AS SHIT
[3:29:54] Literae: @warrenny its like their own brand. Like Asda Smartprice etc
[3:30:01] theDirtyon3: that def has a rollball
[3:30:02] SirMaldo: I still have my first razor Naga mmo mouse. I refuse to get a new one. It‚Äôs fits my hand perfectly.
[3:30:05] ArcaneMaki: Amazon Basics Condoms
[3:30:06] MightyWombat: sure cheap if you can buy stuff outside the border here its a 50% tax on anything outside the borders LUL
[3:30:07] warrenny: @literae Oh right
[3:30:08] festo_gaming: If it works and you're on a budget its perfect
[3:30:10] Aidler: amazon developed an entire basic live
[3:30:12] SirMaldo: It‚Äôs like a decade old
[3:30:13] mozavich: @Sollice i lol'd
[3:30:17] steward93: Not sure if my purchase of the naga pro and charging dock is justified after seeing that xD
[3:30:19] Strouss: Amazon basics is like walmart. they contract what ever is cheap.
[3:30:24] Mecabeast: that looks like the perfect starter mouse
[3:30:28] Literae: Amazon Basic Bitch Kappa sign me up LUL
[3:30:32] dewking93: is there a amazon bacics pc?
[3:30:33] LearnedSomething: amazon basics are products that amazon has decided are too popular to share profits for and started producing it to sell themselves :)
[3:30:46] HairyAreolaus: @jarilrpg that‚Äôs too much work.
[3:30:49] Sollice: I use amazon basic dog poop bags
[3:30:49] AveragePvp: Pog
[3:30:53] danoh_64: bet that stone cold pull was no amazon basic... nice pull there

[3:30:56] RiptoreCA: Thicc
[3:30:57] Sollice: I havent got shit on my hands yet so two thumbs up
[3:31:08] hwiyo: @mayhemz95 It def feels lighter than 100g actually. Weight distribution is pretty amazing. I also had naga pro and g502 so this is good for everything really
[3:31:24] Literae: Amazon Basic USB/HDMI etc all do the same job "basically" pun intended Kappa
[3:31:32] mozavich: @dewking93 it's a calculator :P
[3:31:58] Demanisraar: yeah, my Displayport cables are all amazon also
[3:32:04] Sollice: AV videos are a fucking scam
[3:32:04] Demanisraar: work fine
[3:32:08] Mayhemz95: @hwiyo thanks for the help :)
[3:32:14] SirMaldo: What mouse you using today? I still use my naga from a decade ago. Refuse to give it up
[3:32:15] Literae: All that basic stuff is warehouse stock too so always available prime/next day
[3:32:19] Sollice: cables i mean are a scam
[3:32:37] hwiyo: @Mayhemz95 :)
[3:32:56] Demanisraar: @Sollice true, LTT tested all the cables a while ago and the difference are minimal
[3:33:04] theDirtyon3: have the pro and trinity can confirm
[3:33:18] DiiscoViking: almost all cables are a scam, long length cables or cables run near power wires should be shielded, they cost a bit more not astronomicly
[3:33:25] Sollice: @Demanisraar Yea and prices can be wacky. I remember when HD really became a thing and the MONSTER cables were like 100+ for shit quality
[3:33:25] hwiyo: Pro's sensor is much much better than side buttons are more tactile. Also that razer optical switches on pro. I think Pro is WAY better than trinity
[3:33:27] Mitune: what level is Towelliee now? I'm on mobile and can't see it ATM
[3:33:36] theDirtyon3: pro is where its at though no lag and long battery life
[3:33:39] Gunlove: I have a RAzer Basliisk ultimate and its the only mouse ive owned that iasnt had somthing wrong in over a year
[3:33:40] KaisenSiru: OhMyDog
[3:33:41] unholyshiz: naga trinity is dope can switch it depending on your game
[3:33:58] Demanisraar: @Sollice yeah, biggest scam LUL those companies made bank though on audio/video enthousiasts
[3:34:01] kay0234: @Mitune 66
[3:34:03] warrenny: @unholyshiz Its great tho i only play wow and hs
[3:34:13] dewking93: grass is lava
[3:34:14] Mitune: ty @kay0234
[3:34:27] Sarocus: Talk amongst ourselves? hmm
[3:34:37] Sarocus: You guys want to start a cult or something?
[3:34:44] MightyWombat: if you live in scandinavia amazon is a no go lol, becomes to expensive since custom will demand their part.
[3:34:47] rsimpson105: Grass you say distSip
[3:34:48] FrostyySnapps: soooo hi everyone!?
[3:35:01] Mushythegoblin: he gonna pee on it?
[3:35:03] Demanisraar: Traded my naga 2014 for a Trinity, would have kept the 2014 but the scroll click broke and I need that as I use it as shift modifier

[3:35:49] kay0234: @mushythegoblin i only have 1 paragon mount
[3:35:49] MightyWombat: @Sarocus nope.

[3:37:02] spookychefkarolina: @kay0234 it is the way LUL LUL LUL LUL
[3:38:20] MightyWombat: @Sarocus our borders are sealed tight nothing gets throu without 50% tax its just so dumb...and we arent in the eu so the lock remains
[3:38:22] kay0234: Anyways Amazon Prime is going to change their rate of speed for shipping. Essential items will still be overnight/1 day but all other items will be 5-7 days

[3:44:45] barelygames: presonally i dont see a single reason to pay monthly sub for wow. what do u think @Towelliee
[3:44:53] Molvonos: Lore was the first to  tap out
[3:44:56] Molvonos: It was glorious

[3:46:07] spookychefkarolina: Feelin like you‚Äôre dying ain‚Äôt so bad sometimes LUL LUL
[3:46:19] Sarocus: Terry and Sloot were taking the sexuality test and comparing nastiness levels
[3:46:58] Molvonos: Lore went on a 10 minute 'eat my ass' spree in Terry's chat after going offline, too
[3:46:59] Sarocus: TL;DR Terry is 71% nasty
[3:47:00] Nokterian: First bioshock is still the best
[3:47:07] Nokterian: the opening is fantastic
[3:47:31] spookychefkarolina: Infinite was the best one imo
[3:47:36] Nokterian: "I rejected those answers; instead, I chose something different. I chose the impossible. I chose... Rapture."
[3:47:40] Uglyfoot: I haven't paid for wow since the tokens came out. By the end of Legion I had 10 million gold, 3 years worth of game time, and $300 in my blizzard wallet.
[3:47:47] LearnedSomething: oh it was quite memorable
[3:48:04] pringlez91: the endgame will be the greatest
[3:48:27] jmalmin: The fun mode to get gold is going away though. I am going to miss my mission table :D

[3:49:25] im_capy: Time is money friend
[3:49:30] Tyr7: wow feels so cheap after playing diablo immortal for 2 months, besides its like 77$ for 6 months
[3:49:31] Aidler: enough people pay for wow with buying tokens, else there would be no tokens to buy for gold
[3:49:31] spookychefkarolina: @mr_pennywise_ good luck. My fianc√© went into A-Fib at 29 and it wasn‚Äôt great.
[3:50:02] yuvalal: sadly i dont have time to farm gold and work :(
[3:50:02] warrenny: I would make gold but id rather do other stuff
[3:50:39] Nokterian: now its currently 308k gold in the EU a WoW token
[3:50:42] jerseyfive: and me idiot did not buy 100 of them FeelsBadMan
[3:50:45] Artenuous: gold companions from the garrison is how I made most of my gold. still have gold to this day
[3:50:45] Mushythegoblin: i did just wq today.. and 5300 gold sofar
[3:50:46] Seoullis: You can only hold so many tokens at once right?
[3:50:54] Retpally9329: WoD is the reason I have all the tier 3 pieces now. was so good.
[3:51:04] LearnedSomething: legion was pretty good for gold too
[3:51:05] jmalmin: The stories of the people buying tokens for 30-50 million gold just such they could be OP in Diablo the mobile game.
[3:51:34] Strifelol: We made millions selling Archimonde in WoD lmao
[3:52:05] Aidler: how did people make all the gold in WoD?

[3:52:18] fewyn: i used wow gold to buy destiny 2.... such a a bad idea
[3:52:32] Seoullis: I remember my first WoW Token purchase was funded by Firewater and FIsh from Darkmoon
[3:52:33] Rottencoarse: @Aidler  mining and herb
[3:52:39] Rottencoarse: @Aidler  and crafting
[3:52:44] LearnedSomething: I bought destiny 2 with wow gold :)
[3:52:55] brian_777777777: dang you can make wow tokens by the hour? thats crazy
[3:53:32] Aidler: @rottencoarse thanks. I played during WoD but missed that‚Ä¶. sadge
[3:53:43] TheCliffyShow: I remember when these maps were first datamined. People were getting so hyped, and coming up with all this crazy speculation about whole new game mods, Death of Chromie style shit.
[3:54:01] warrenny: Guessing this is the bronze zone üòÇ
[3:54:03] Rottencoarse: @Aidler  i made around 2 mil gold sitting in my garrison crafting stuff lol
[3:54:09] HaxzorJimDuggan: ive bought server transfer with wow gold
[3:54:26] Rottencoarse: @Aidler  and ofc mission table
[3:54:26] jmalmin: I have almost achieved my goal in shadowlands. Getting 10 million.  Doing those blue quests on 22 characters every 3 days does make you a fortune. And you do them so fast now when you out gear the content.
[3:54:28] toniban89: who has that much gold
[3:54:39] GiveLoveLive: Arc light rumble when
[3:54:48] Strifelol: I made like 12 million selling Archimonde in WoD, ended up buying a spectral tiger and using the rest to buy game time and fund the start of Legion lol
[3:54:54] jbmoongirl: What‚Äôs max gold in game now?
[3:55:17] Scoodles91: 10 mil is gold cap
[3:55:20] homewrecker101: isnt it 10mil ?
[3:55:23] starknadooo: Its still 9,999,999
[3:55:24] Mushythegoblin: say 500 million?
[3:55:25] Rottencoarse: @Towelliee  10 million is gold cap per cap
[3:55:27] Rottencoarse: *char
[3:55:28] Mushythegoblin: 10 mill per char?
[3:55:43] jmalmin: 9.9 million. per character. So if you got 10 characters it goes up to 99.9 million and so on.
[3:55:51] jbmoongirl: That‚Äôs what I thought but wasn‚Äôt sure. Thanks chat
[3:56:09] Aidler: ask asmon‚Ä¶. he hardly gets below gold cap
[3:56:21] FrostyySnapps: @Towelliee how's the diet going? Just straight keto right?
[3:56:24] toniban89: asmon gets it as a gift
[3:56:29] toniban89: he doesnt farm
[3:56:44] NBK_Sethus: tax the rich, remove gold from anyone who has over a million LUL
[3:56:49] Aidler: @toniban89 yeah
[3:57:00] jbmoongirl: I usually buy a token every pay check.
[3:57:06] toniban89: =)
[3:57:10] jmalmin: Chromie is my favorite wow character :)
[3:57:19] MightyWombat: nah tax the poor.. and give to the rich :p
[3:58:15] bluefrostiezz: Hey @Towelliee  do you play in 2k or 4k?

[3:58:52] Shivlary: This kinda gives me wrath nostalgia

[3:58:55] Zuhbuumafu: @Towelliee I think he means resolution
[3:58:55] HighThereBud: I think he meant resolution?
[3:59:11] jerseyfive: there is no 2k res
[3:59:14] flink94: @Towelliee i havent play the alpha  and dont know what to play in the next exp prot war or bremaster what do you think looks the most fun and the best ?
[3:59:17] toniban89: prob not intended
[3:59:20] HighThereBud: 2k is 1440p
[3:59:43] HairyAreolaus: @jbmoongirl that‚Äôs the only way to farm gold nowadays. ;)
[3:59:49] brian_777777777: 4k is 2160 so wouldnt 2k be 1080

[4:13:44] bigbearjackson: @warrenny they used to
[4:13:45] TheCliffyShow: I heard a fan theory that Eternus is Chromie.
[4:14:01] Red_Fr0st_: same as Murozond
[4:14:04] NBK_Sethus: Mrrrggllon Deez Nuts
[4:14:16] luckfore: should we do this quest at level 70 so it scales up higher?

[4:21:17] Groukh: The video about LeiShen that Asmon reacted to months ago was so cool
[4:21:38] TheCliffyShow: That's why they invented monks. They weren't allowed weapons so they learned hand to hand combat to fight back.
[4:21:57] Broomba: Anyone who has taken Advanced GG -- i have the starter pack and use 1 table spoon as my scoop is that enough or too much?

[4:25:03] wEiRdO_dUdE: I accidentally did two sample packets the other morning. I was feeling really up, but I wasn't trashed or anything
[4:25:13] 3663Sharad: I have to admit that the new dragon models are weird in some way. Probably a grower
[4:25:14] warrenny: I have two large red bulls sometimes at work not sure how much caffeine that is tho
[4:25:34] TheCliffyShow: Therazane chilling down there.
[4:25:47] Orion280: do we know why some classes for example priest have been so silent with talent tree's?
[4:25:48] Broomba: @towelliee -- thats a good idea
[4:25:52] Broomba: ty
[4:25:54] TheCliffyShow: To think, someone had sex with her to make the centaurs.
[4:26:04] SirVoro: I really liked the cotton candy
[4:26:34] TheCliffyShow: Do you ever snort it like coke?
[4:26:34] wEiRdO_dUdE: I think the tubs are 40 servings, right? So yeah like 20 days
[4:26:39] Broomba: @Jasondelco i have the cotton candy in my starter -- do u use milk or water?
[4:26:51] SirVoro: I only use watered for mine it was good
[4:26:52] SanctusPrior: whats that scenario thing is it part of a quest line?

[4:27:57] Groukh: That or xp tuning is too low
[4:28:15] UtherBrexton: probably be doing dungeon finder along the way normally too
[4:28:22] hordplayer: is just me or this platform looks like a raid boss arena
[4:28:25] wEiRdO_dUdE: Yeah the focus is smooth and you're just awake and alert and it does help me concentrate well
[4:28:26] Broomba: @Groukh hes doing only main quests -- so its tuned properly
[4:29:25] ninedraft317: this whole zone looks insane
[4:29:39] krispykreeem: couple kratom and an energy drink and im super focused for half a day
[4:29:50] wEiRdO_dUdE: Yeah, I had never tried those kinds of ingredients, it's good stuff

[4:30:57] wEiRdO_dUdE: @Broomba The mango is really good, I was lucky to get that one
[4:31:12] spyderfred: how long has the focus been on the market?
[4:31:31] dimofodi: Do you know why they're discontinuing it?
[4:32:27] dimofodi: Makes sense then
[4:32:29] MightyWombat: ah my country is on the list that dont accept the packages LUL not surprised
[4:33:32] cabalish: @boolmantv https://chillbyadvanced.gg/
[4:33:36] Kaydwen: @Towelliee Hows the zone transition feel when leveling since we never got to really test that with the more focused testing
[4:33:45] snackpakahoy0: what are the sethic lizards dudes doing in DF?
[4:33:47] MightyWombat: oh thats in there...no wonder its not going over the borders here...its considered a drug here
[4:33:55] awesomeness_inc: @Towelliee why stream so early?
[4:34:10] wEiRdO_dUdE: Danger!

[4:34:40] MightyWombat: grabs wrong jar by mistake and drink the chill instead of focus passes out during the raid LUL
[4:34:55] biofreaks: 60 - 70 in 8 - 10 hours you think?
[4:35:01] hexx29: Still lifting?
[4:35:13] SirBiggimus: @awesomeness_inc he has a big following in the EU, so when he starts at 3am, he can get that presence
[4:35:20] MightyWombat: cool armor look you got
[4:35:26] Kebabit0: early group farming Sigils/Flow
[4:35:36] cabalish: u got exp
[4:36:01] wEiRdO_dUdE: I could definitely see groups of people farming exp here
[4:36:44] Uglyfoot: Man I wish there was a tank spec for the new class...
[4:36:44] Kebabit0: It means leveling alt will be a prio when main is getting max and not leftovers after the main grind
[4:36:49] Kebabit0: Interesting
[4:36:55] neo_0098: ofc another Invasion xD
[4:37:12] minael1: so basically we need to farm till we puke. pick up. and farm again. then maybe we buy smth
[4:37:19] nusher1: @Towelliee Do you still have a discount code for advanced?
[4:37:22] luckfore: wish the campaign quests were enough to get to 70

[4:39:39] Akillargaming: ty are you 64?
[4:39:53] wEiRdO_dUdE: They could add a threads of fate sort of thing in a later patch
[4:39:54] ShowDUH: 67 you can see on screen
[4:40:00] Akillargaming: 60 to 64 for 8hours?
[4:40:05] Kebabit0: Oh damn... Because it would make early flow farming even better
[4:40:45] luckfore: so you need to get about 2.5 levels from side quests
[4:40:46] Kebabit0: I hope we have something similar to Threads
[4:40:53] epockite: are there any mounts with the stone dragon look?  that's what i would want.
[4:41:01] Akillargaming: nope can not see on screen is burry on twitch

[4:42:03] Akillargaming: oh silly me is video quailly sorry
[4:42:04] luckfore: campaign is pretty short
[4:42:08] wEiRdO_dUdE: With releasing this year, I just want to see the main quest line being solid, and progression alright...then later on they can make things easier for our alts
[4:42:08] Akillargaming: fix
[4:42:12] Kebabit0: maybe dungeon quests on every zone + some side quests
[4:42:14] mavell21: are there dungeon quests with xp tied to it?
[4:42:18] grime259: unfollowing
[4:42:36] Riep: whats the ilvl gear u get from quest

[4:45:58] HairyAreolaus: @towelliee did you expect a 10 lvl increase when Dragonflight was first announced?
[4:45:59] wEiRdO_dUdE: 9 hours through MSQ is not bad
[4:46:05] manhooties: have they added questline for post 70 yet? or are they saving it?

[4:46:42] Akillargaming: oh silly me got be 70s
[4:46:45] Yosbo: usualy side quests tie well into the main story q,s they share the same area.s
[4:46:49] Yosbo: so easy to combine
[4:47:12] Uguntinsh: And imagine with our mythic gear, this will be faster
[4:47:21] wEiRdO_dUdE: In Shadowlands it took me 15 hours to hit level cap, and I got gated a few times on level and had to go back for side quests, while going through MSQ
[4:48:20] Aidler: for my leveling speed I need to take that time and multiply by 10 naguuraThinking
[4:48:23] wEiRdO_dUdE: Oh yeah, with our currenty Shadowlands gear, we're going to fly through these quests
[4:48:34] Orion280: i don't understand why the ilvl is so low
[4:48:43] codefiveone: seems a bit too slow for my taste

[4:49:13] Youredoneson666: i still feel like they might bump up the ilvl before release. seems low still
[4:49:35] wEiRdO_dUdE: uh oh
[4:50:08] Daikanatv: @Towelliee isn't it because you have a 70 already and this pala is concidered an alt?
[4:50:24] epockite: could it be becuase you already have a max toon?

[5:19:29] AureliusXV: world first?
[5:19:29] Vivelli: but i doubt

[5:21:47] Vivelli: @Aidler i think thats more likely, i think he said if it wasnt for world first raiding he would be a wow casual
[5:21:57] Broomba: @emznev you love to throw a big wide net and assumption
[5:22:26] emznev: @Broomba salt is real out here

[5:37:53] selenaknows: is this water Warcraft
[5:38:00] Kickack: does it really turn green?
[5:38:03] manmower: you gotta take a shot whenever you see a cutscene with a dragon
[5:38:03] Aidler: maybe you really transform into the Hulk when you drink that
[5:38:08] Puppette: @Mr_Pennywise_ towHAMUP towLove

[5:38:48] Mr_Pennywise_: towLove
[5:38:48] Kickack: it do, but that sounds like bad time for me. if only i had better drinking habits
[5:39:03] QQisLIVE: Wrath is such a good time for Pally why not?
[5:39:19] TheodorABD: is it just me or does dragonflight feel much more alive and more warcraft like than shadowlands
[5:39:34] wEiRdO_dUdE: Yeah, paladins are boss in Wrath
[5:39:38] QQisLIVE: Yea but we are boomers the Nostalgia is great for our Egos haha
[5:39:40] akaari5486: seen that,done that basically
[5:39:48] lookItsJB: too true QQ
[5:39:51] luckfore: why play something old when you can play the new shiny thing instead
[5:40:03] Kickack: New XPac > old content for new people that want to stop hearing they didn't know what it was like back then
[5:40:07] CrunkyBrewster: agreed
[5:40:10] lassefot: whaaaat
[5:40:20] QQisLIVE: I feel that. Dragonflight is looking like it's going back to it's roots so I hope its good.
[5:40:24] manmower: leave the fond memories of wrath in the past
[5:40:30] MrGattz: yeah its kinda dumb what they did to wrath
[5:40:32] wEiRdO_dUdE: There are making a lot of good changes for Wrath, but yeah that LFD is a major stumble
[5:40:34] MrGattz: it kinda sucks
[5:40:37] sabyn4: so you cant type in one of the channels prot pal lfg UK heroic???
[5:40:39] TheodorABD: does the zones have music now or im i hearing things?
[5:40:52] Lenietwitch: @kickack well they wont be able to actually live it, it's a different time itself, even if the game is the same, the ppl isn't so that's in the past :P
[5:41:07] sabyn4: it wont especially for you
[5:41:18] akaari5486: whats that arrow about near your buffs and debuffs
[5:41:19] ArcaneMaki: My life is currently too busy to deal with manually looking for a group. Thus why LFD was the best feature for me back in Wrath.
[5:41:33] HaxzorJimDuggan: try playing a non min max class dps and ask for a group
[5:41:42] Kickack: @leniewashere thanks for proving that no mater what everyone will still receive some kind of snarky comment LUL
[5:41:42] CrunkyBrewster: bingo
[5:41:54] luckfore: muh classic experience
[5:41:58] SoulToned: the sense of "community" they are trying to preserve there is long gone
[5:41:59] Paddleson: went to checkout sofi stadium last night, its pretty dope!
[5:42:05] CrunkyBrewster: Gearscore Lords
[5:42:09] Aidler: guess that‚Äôs what separates people these days. those who always want to play the same old game and those who want to play the new game
[5:42:23] Eraste: ya, i hit 70 in tbc classic, got kicked after the first pull in the dungeon. uninstalled and never went back
[5:42:24] Lenietwitch: @kickack haahaha well ye, the problem is the ppl that makes those comments and feel superior xD, just fuck em haha
[5:42:31] walltec23: Hi man what are you most looking forward to in wrath ?
[5:42:39] codefiveone: wait, this xpac is supposed to be super casual?
[5:42:42] Kickack: must be 1k+ item level and already have the achieve for the newly release raid/dungeon
[5:42:50] StealthyNakroth: New players cant get without spending tons of gold doing so.
[5:42:50] Zenbali97: what does GDKP stand for? Gold.....?
[5:42:58] humanzd: Wrath is extremely easy all around
[5:43:04] TinmanFPS: I loved wrath for the zones and PVP
[5:43:07] codefiveone: gold dragon kill points
[5:43:08] StueartTV: classic hater
[5:43:10] wEiRdO_dUdE: GDKP is going to be huge this time, no doubt about that
[5:43:16] Broomba: that requirement for SL for Mythic runs where i fail to qualify is too stupid and havent done any mythic dungeons since they implemented it, it sucks for me a casual
[5:43:25] MrGattz: FailFish
[5:43:30] Kickack: @leniewashere for sure, i just know that's how it would go if anyone said how much they like the classic. god forbid they say they like current content
[5:43:34] brian_777777777: that sweet exclusivity normal players wont be able to farm their rep for jeeves
[5:43:34] abracka_: chat pepega on weekends

[5:44:01] humanzd: There is no chance they don't give us RDF by Ulduar
[5:44:07] wEiRdO_dUdE: "Loot auction" is a more accurate term
[5:44:15] venom366: gold buyer paradise Kappa
[5:44:18] Nokterian: lmao
[5:44:28] CrunkyBrewster: truth
[5:44:32] MrGattz: and they were all begging for that 2x xp also
[5:44:37] Kickack: i was just happy i could do solo content during bfa even tho i wanted to do higher end content

[5:45:33] solor3544: totally agree
[5:45:38] McTigue: can you hire me
[5:45:41] Aidler: failsafe at least is a consequential classic andy
[5:45:41] TialePetit: Vanilla -> didn't get dungeon finder... Classic -> cries cause they don't have the dungeon finder that retail has.
[5:45:43] Jarlan23: i didnt even play BC. classic tainted my experience and i didnt wanna do that again for bc and wrath
[5:45:47] Nokterian: 'Im gonna reply to myself so i will hate it again!" Kappa
[5:45:55] Mitune: coxRee coxRee coxRee coxRee
[5:45:58] maccaruso: Never understood the hate.  Look hard to find something you like about the xpac. Makes things a lot more fun.

[5:46:33] PappaKappaa: Hey @Towelliee how's flying feel?
[5:46:48] XshadowturkeyX: lets be real we liked the game back then causse everyone was stupid at the game and doing w/e
[5:46:52] Zalchemaar: will yogg+0 not be difficult in your oppinion?
[5:47:08] CrunkyBrewster: i feel like they're doing it to cap on ppl spamming heroics for badge gear honestly. lfd made that so easy back then
[5:47:11] Jarlan23: @XshadowturkeyX yea that was part of the fun
[5:47:15] Jaytaz: @XshadowturkeyX exactly.. now people have like spreadsheets and shit to minmax - not enjoyable
[5:47:22] Jarlan23: @XshadowturkeyX and everyone hanging out in game and talking was a good thing about it too
[5:47:35] kyr_slowbro: Dragon riding the new Torghast. Starts great, then gets worse with changes.
[5:47:36] PappaKappaa: Ah, hope they are working on that
[5:47:47] StealthyNakroth: Dragonflight look to be more alt friendly, Towelliee?
[5:47:49] LearnedSomething: I hope they get the dragon flying thing right in time for release
[5:48:09] Eraste: wait what changed with riding?
[5:48:30] wEiRdO_dUdE: I like how 10 man raiding in Wrath is pretty good
[5:48:44] CrunkyBrewster: none. whatsoever really. i agree dude
[5:48:48] Aidler: @stealthynakroth I really hope so üôè
[5:48:52] venom366: they dont want people to beat nax ez Kappa
[5:48:56] brian_777777777: yeah they just want a vendor with all of the epics :)
[5:49:00] CrunkyBrewster: nax LUL
[5:49:11] luckfore: classic andy streamers gonna cry for SoM 2.0 after wrath out for a month KEKW
[5:49:12] Aquadriel: wrath babies doing what they do best, fucking cry KEKW
[5:49:13] sabyn4: I thiink blizzard is just trying to 'keep the community alive' so thats there justification for not allowing lfg
[5:49:33] 6o4FX: If they draw it out they can get an extra month of sub XD
[5:49:33] Moobot: towHAMUP Follow Towelliee on twitter so you can be in the know at all times! | twitter.com/towelthetank towKawaii
[5:49:49] CrunkyBrewster: i remember when i played wrath i played with maybe two friends of mine. that was it
[5:49:58] Kinghorn: bitching at people not bidding on items
[5:50:02] Kinghorn: very social
[5:50:10] sabyn4: @Towelliee i respect them for trying but we live in 2022 with google and min maxxing happens in literally every game so them leaving lfg out is kinda stupid even im usually hard on 'fuck lfg'
[5:50:16] LearnedSomething: blood dk soloing everything
[5:50:18] Zenbali97: not only the expansion, but most people aren't wired like that anymore, it's like social engineering
[5:50:19] Metrii: yeah I think its bullshit they dont have the lfg tbh. Thats dumb af imo
[5:50:19] humanzd: Sorry to breaking the conversation, but how do you like the general theme / art of the zones in DF?
[5:50:51] Mesharii91: lmao the "hardcore" pricks. They ALWAYS look for ways to shit on retail and retail players
[5:50:56] he4d89: @Metrii This killed my interest in playing Wrath classic
[5:50:58] mrsuflakis: they are gonna add it 100%
[5:51:01] Aidler: yeah the social gaming meta some big streamers and YT content creators brought up some years ago was really a myth
[5:51:07] wEiRdO_dUdE: The 1% purists
[5:51:21] kraydom: They should make two type of servers LFD and non LFD
[5:51:23] PappaKappaa: LFG is love, fck the neckbeards not wanting it
[5:51:24] Eraste: blizzard and not listening is like peanut butter and jelly
[5:51:27] Orion280: the no LFG is the exact same situation as grimrail M+
[5:51:29] Aquadriel: no LFG is to please those 5 dudes that are still clinging to #nochanges lmao
[5:51:35] abracka_: just got the wrath beta the other day, looked at their lfg system and it is literal garbage
[5:51:36] Cineron: reddit isn't the only wow community
[5:51:38] brian_777777777: lfd energy
[5:51:39] QQisLIVE: They aren't even doing Faction change till later in wotlk too.
[5:51:43] SonofHorus82: "listening to the community" was them sending out 5000 surveys and 51% of those coming back saying no LFD and they were like "welp, that's a majority of the community I guess!"
[5:51:43] Zilberg: We hear you KEKW
[5:51:46] abracka_: they need to just add lfd to this shit already
[5:51:51] SonofHorus82: Removing LFD is a horrible idea.
[5:52:00] MindhackerTV: im in favor of LFG only if it is same realm....
[5:52:03] Lobsterofwar: LFD was added in ICC patch right? i dont remember. I wish they would just have it from release
[5:52:11] SpoofAvatar: SheHulk was funny
[5:52:14] solor3544: I won't play till the put it in
[5:52:17] QQisLIVE: @Towelliee If you have Apple TV I highly suggest watching "For All Mankind"
[5:52:20] the_general01: @Lobsterofwar in 7.3
[5:52:22] CrunkyBrewster: yeah we didnt get LFD til the very end
[5:52:25] XshadowturkeyX: just add LFG in the same time they release icc raid like it was back then it would please both side, or not, idc if its in or not ,learned to play without it in tbc, but you bet your ass ill use the shit out of it if its added
[5:52:27] brian_777777777: if classic pvp wasnt cross realm it would be dead
[5:52:29] MindhackerTV: ofc it does
[5:52:38] abracka_: 120v120 wintergrasp, gonna be nuts
[5:52:43] grumpnamedjosh: my favorite way to timegate content. An hour long fiasco of making a group, heading to the dungeon, and than finally actually running it.
[5:52:44] gooseboy429: im on server with 9-% alliance so probably a joke
[5:52:47] rensdeamo: Looks good when you Kiss - how many years have u been 2gether ?
[5:52:48] wEiRdO_dUdE: It looks like they are doing Wintergrasp right, making it an instanced BG
[5:52:48] Nokterian: i liked she hulk the fact that they talked if captain america was still a virgin made me laugh LUL
[5:52:48] spiked16: @Towelliee do you think they will lose players without LFD ??
[5:52:48] abracka_: region i think they said
[5:52:50] sabyn4: it was server i thought
[5:52:50] gooseboy429: 90%
[5:52:52] Kale_Nd: region based
[5:52:53] N3llee: they turning into a bg style
[5:52:54] codefiveone: same realm LOL
[5:52:55] StealthyNakroth: Server
[5:52:55] LearnedSomething: battlegroup
[5:52:57] Kale_Nd: it's just a bg
[5:53:01] Lifestream7: I think they are making it like a battleground
[5:53:01] Cryptexzz: It was originally server
[5:53:07] Lifestream7: because of faction imbalances
[5:53:27] Cabbageman007: Chat..is there a guide that tells you the ratings you can get per run and key used?
[5:53:27] Moobot: Plans for WOTLK LAUNCH! Marathon from Sept 26th - October 1st! This won't be like TBC Launch. Since this launches around DF Beta and DF Launch. We will still no life it and get Pre-Raid BiS. I AM PLAYING ON FRESH!
[5:53:28] CrunkyBrewster: it use to be early in Wrath, Server based though. and then they changed it to something you had to queue in
[5:53:29] Captblinky49: davedib47 subscribed with Prime. 
[5:53:29] Captblinky49: davedib47 subscribed with Prime. 
[5:53:50] Melonbrew: anyone know what the pre=patch event will be for DF?
[5:53:51] wEiRdO_dUdE: Yeah, Dragonflight is coming so quick
[5:53:52] ozilot: classic is stale and slow and spaming 1 ability its so boring.
[5:53:54] MindhackerTV: they should never release both in the same month
[5:54:01] Aidler: so they give Wotlk classic 3 weeks
[5:54:07] thebakeriscomingforu: Wotlk classic is for folks that either missed it the first time or long for that era.
[5:54:27] QQisLIVE: Thats plenty of time to get set up on wotlk and then jump over to DF
[5:55:00] wEiRdO_dUdE: That's true, and it worked better when Classic had releases on off years
[5:55:15] MindhackerTV: wrath is awsome
[5:55:15] Metrii: yaeh
[5:55:17] Metrii: I missed it
[5:55:17] Kickack: i miss cata
[5:55:20] cerentrios: i missed wrath
[5:55:21] MindhackerTV: best raids ever
[5:55:22] Ayo_Splash: I missed it
[5:55:22] Metrii: i played but not end game
[5:55:25] choco_wow: i started in cata
[5:55:27] maccaruso: I missed Wrath.  I was working 80 hours weeks back then
[5:55:28] Eraste: wrath is my most played xpac. definitely no interest in doing it again
[5:55:29] cerentrios: I started playuing in Cata
[5:55:29] McTigue: i started on classic relaunch lmao
[5:55:30] Metrii: I didnt have the money or decent computer
[5:55:31] thebakeriscomingforu: I'd have spaced releases a bit more if it was me, but it was likely a decision made by "the money men"
[5:55:32] LearnedSomething: I have good memories
[5:55:34] Melonbrew: I miss TBC, Wotlk and Cata :)
[5:55:34] cowthulhu1: I dont miss wrath i did it all once.
[5:55:38] N3llee: here is the reality. Month or two into naxx players will get realy bored and leave
[5:55:39] LearnedSomething: I wouldn't say I'd wanna do it again
[5:55:40] Kickack: even tho i only leveled a huntard LUL
[5:55:43] luckfore: only reason ppl play classic is for nostalgia
[5:55:43] LearnedSomething: but I remember it fondly
[5:55:50] manmower: retail is a much better experience
[5:55:51] MindhackerTV: cata was garbo... only firelands escaped
[5:55:52] SoulToned: i dont miss wrath but i think itd fun to play again
[5:55:56] SoulToned: no lfd sucks
[5:55:57] QQisLIVE: I miss MOP... It was just way too fun all around. Open world rares, toys, PVP... Ugh
[5:56:01] ozilot: i miss draneor it might nkt have had allot of content but it was gooda
[5:56:03] Aidler: I came back in cata when they introduced LFR
[5:56:08] LearnedSomething: you didn't like icc?
[5:56:14] Burkie206: I loved ICC but it was my first taste of raiding, not sure how I would like it all these years later
[5:56:19] LearnedSomething: hell I even enjoyed ZG :)
[5:56:19] manmower: have they shown any new pvp content for DF yet?
[5:56:20] Kinghorn: but what about the amazing jousting
[5:56:30] PapaBeks: Wrath was cool bc of Arthas, but as an xpac, not sure why people are so pumped, it was just ok.
[5:56:36] thebakeriscomingforu: Ulduar was pretty cool.
[5:57:24] mmmone: what are u all thinking about this new expansion will it be gd?\
[5:57:31] ozilot: uldum leveling was peak of content
[5:57:33] mmmone: i am thinking of returning
[5:57:37] Arbszy: Wrath had a lot of cut content that many don't realize about.
[5:58:00] Arbszy: Wrath was a dev nightmare in terms plans have to change becuase of tech problems
[5:58:04] shalfey4: lvling up feels bad, I'm stop enjoying it after I hit lvl 48 on retail
[5:58:12] FatGuyonaHoverboard: lvl up to more buttons less power true
[5:58:22] elitistdk: they never add new pvp content they cant be bothered
[5:58:26] wEiRdO_dUdE: There is world PvP gear that you get with bloody coins from killing people, but it doesn't seem like much else
[5:58:44] iisobase: The PvP content is them balancing Evoker lol
[5:58:46] thebakeriscomingforu: Wotlk also felt like there was scrapped content to.
[5:58:56] abracka_: @Arbszy aerial combat lol
[5:59:08] Arbszy: @abracka_ It was there but in lesser form.
[5:59:17] Arbszy: Wintergrasp mainly
[5:59:18] lrddoom: 10 hrs for 67 and 75% ish isnt to bad tbh
[5:59:25] ankan91swe: what are the itmlvl at lvl 70 for loot in dungeons and max zoon ? :)
[5:59:40] wEiRdO_dUdE: The big thing for PvP in Dragonflight is with their gear scaling...two tiers of ilvl...one crap and the other conquest...and it all scales to the same ilvl
[5:59:53] thebakeriscomingforu: Utgarde felt like there was a raid that never was added. Same for the troll zone.
[6:00:00] Arbszy: But Crystallong Forest had no questline because Dalaran crashed the zone and Argent Tournament of course couldnt be there for same issues, so it was moved to IceCrown which made no sense to me.
[6:00:19] rensdeamo: You going for 70 2day ?
[6:00:22] IchabodCrain: What's the timer for? marathon?
[6:00:41] ankan91swe: normal , hc , mythic 0 loot at lvl 70 :)
[6:00:46] thebakeriscomingforu: @Arbszy the placement always felt weird
[6:00:48] ankan91swe: itmlvl?
[6:01:01] Eraste: @IchabodCrain leveling time from 60-70

[6:01:53] thebakeriscomingforu: I don't recall a confirmation

[6:39:43] newkingcody: @abracka_ KEKW
[6:39:44] Armdel: development of the game takes so long because every few years they have to update the graphics to keep it relevant
[6:39:45] Two_Headed_Raven: 2048?!?! He knows Kappa
[6:39:45] Tirony: ye necrit
[6:39:47] xXBuck: Wildstar east
[6:39:50] neugassh: hype for riot mmo? LUL the game has an interactive map nothing more
[6:39:52] akia03: is that riot mmo even being made still?
[6:39:53] xXBuck: It couldve been so good!
[6:39:53] wakeandbacon95: wild star Pepehand
[6:39:54] manmower: Secret World
[6:39:58] MrGattz: yeah but wildstar only died cause the devs killed it
[6:39:58] Kickack: yeah, they've been slowly building it with events in league of legos
[6:40:03] MrGattz: not cause the game was bad
[6:40:03] Mitune: Honestly, Wildstar needs to be brought back but made modern
[6:40:09] wEiRdO_dUdE: There is a lot of potential for the Riot MMO, and they do have a lot to work with....but I'm not sold yet, we haven't seen actual gameplay
[6:40:09] Flonde33: warhammer
[6:40:13] newkingcody: wildstar has a private server now
[6:40:19] kurlook: Screw it everyone just go back to RuneScape
[6:40:31] Murlock07: I miss Wildstar
[6:40:34] Kickack: Is molten wow still up?

[6:40:47] LearnedSomething: does anyone even get hemingway references
[6:41:04] MeisterPetze: still 67... jeez
[6:41:26] ElDrakenMan: star citizen is a scam people just need to say it. its been 12 years since release and the games has made half a billion dollars and still isnt actually released
[6:41:48] splash_mm: @Towelliee would u say wow is a good game?
[6:41:56] Broomba: pass the peace pipe
[6:41:58] Rowini30: @drakenPWN true it's sad streamers still pimp it
[6:42:22] Kneckt: its got potential
[6:42:22] newkingcody: do they have many bonus objectives?
[6:42:23] Armdel: probably better to be safe and hit max before the end of the story
[6:42:23] Kneckt: for sure
[6:42:24] LearnedSomething: LUL
[6:42:30] taciturnrandom: LUL

[6:44:01] newkingcody: KEKW
[6:44:01] LearnedSomething: yeah these are SL fish
[6:44:05] Mitune: I wish they would update fishing to be more than wait and click. Like click then stop in the green bar or something
[6:44:17] EpicMonkeyFailzGaming: @splashishere its the only reason i came back after /ragequit when they took out multiboxing lol
[6:44:36] abracka_: wowhead made a post about the renown system, comments section is saying "why would anyone want this account bound"
[6:44:41] abracka_: good god

[6:45:46] dylandevsstuff: It‚Äôs the same community no matter the platform
[6:45:47] manmower: probably because it is the same people commenting
[6:45:50] 91Niki: Stupid people, stupid people everywhere
[6:45:52] Kneckt: @PPoppy_ Dragonflight
