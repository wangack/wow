[0:16:34] beamfleot: savixArrive
[0:16:34] youngfuz: No. World pvp
[0:16:41] goochyboi: @edeni exactly go play on a pve servert
[0:16:44] xarnac: He obviously has issues
[0:16:45] Moose_Ka: camping someone for hours is different then removing a buff they can get again in a few hours
[0:16:49] insaniacc_: Theyre not targeting specific people
[0:16:49] Deadge_Gartic: if its not intended to play like that they should fix it instead of banning lmao
[0:16:51] zatyna_: difference between world pvp and griefing no?
[0:16:51] insaniacc_: they target EVERYONE
[0:16:53] gelobangin: yea until it happens to you constantly lol
[0:16:54] insaniacc_: its part of the game
[0:16:55] sarbuu: all day long thats too much
[0:17:02] CitrusCatChise: It takes forever to get buffs like 2-3 hours and then imagine finally going and a lowbie priest just dispells it all in less than 30seconds @Savix
[0:17:04] insaniacc_: cancdy
[0:17:06] Anthony_1985: but if you dont want to get ganked then go to pve server
[0:17:13] jo_inro: I understand how the chatters feel, but he has no intent to ACTUALLY go into combat with these people, just grief.
[0:17:14] Anthony_1985: its part of the game

[0:17:24] Grubjaw: SOOONIIII SAREEEE savixJuice savixJuice
[0:17:26] DangerousMusabi: Basically just playing to troll, maybe hurting the MMO or RPG exp, but I think WB hurted the exp more with raidlogging at the time.
[0:17:26] Deadge_Gartic: @Savix if game allows you to do that its not his fault , if its banable they should fix it
[0:17:32] insaniacc_: jo_inro ye but its up to the devs to make them undispellable then, not to ban people for dispelling them
[0:17:33] gelobangin: yea but cost so much money also
[0:17:42] zatyna_: @jo_inro  BASEDCIGAR
[0:17:57] amoonguss_3000: i think its just funny to watch keking
[0:17:59] jo_inro: @insaniacc_ agree 100%

[0:18:37] admiralpencil: once or twice its funny
[0:18:42] Synikll: It's on the devs to remove anti-social parasites from a social game. If your goal is harassment I have 0 sympathy.
[0:18:44] gelobangin: lol tbh - its pretty funny but its messed up
[0:18:46] edeni: It's rogue RP KEKW
[0:18:46] 7thSaga: LUL
[0:18:46] Deadge_Gartic: @Savix that is scamming its different its banable , other guy is just playing the game degen or not
[0:18:48] CitrusCatChise: He's rping
[0:18:48] geminuspr: lol
[0:18:48] admiralpencil: but doing it all day is kinda shitty
[0:18:50] insaniacc_: @Savix difference is, worldbuffs being dispellable at this point was a choice made by blizzard. They had years to change it and never chose to do so
[0:18:51] amoonguss_3000: rping as a rogue om
[0:18:52] beamfleot: yoink
[0:18:54] gelobangin: also - if the summoners are not bots they would catch it
[0:18:58] Deadge_Gartic: @insaniacc_ exactly
[0:19:01] Lilithintent: hmm
[0:19:02] j0llylox: Wasn't that tiny?

[0:19:35] Deadge_Gartic: @Savix 1 is scamming and against tos and other is just doing what blizzard allows you Shruge
[0:19:38] zatyna_: peepoCheer

[2:58:56] fuzzywuzzyqt: @Turbopumper They still do
[2:59:04] Banecraft: Lore wise there are no holy or disc priests
