[8:43:25] straxem: but its near instant hand in
[8:43:32] Freddiepines: but they don't take 20%
[8:43:35] chancechants: ghostg74Yeaaaok
[8:43:37] straxem: instead of going to sewers
[8:43:39] XThAcReEpErX: ok your saying yours and his money made combined
[8:43:40] Freddiepines: the VU takes way more than 20%
[8:43:40] danknesss4207: 120 rolled = 60 clean
[8:43:42] XThAcReEpErX: gotcha
[8:43:46] ErobbIsWhite: wrong lol
[8:43:47] dibadibb: lmfao we get the math, but does the VU take a cut?
[8:43:51] Fakomi: Dentge
[8:44:02] danknesss4207: @dibadibb 50%
[8:44:22] TheLadyCupcake: so what you are saying is you are wrong LMAOOOOOOOOOO
[8:44:33] dibadibb: @dibadibb there we have it then
[8:44:40] straxem: graycenStress graycenStress graycenStress graycenStress graycenStress
[8:44:53] XThAcReEpErX: chat add what gray would make selling the wheel and cam would get for doing tire job normally its more than what he would make giving cam the tire for just one job
[8:44:59] Sun_Rah: WhatChamp
[8:45:43] XThAcReEpErX: I do
[8:45:46] straxem: nou
[8:46:16] straxem: berticussMock
[8:46:30] Sun_Rah: Dentge
[8:46:45] Fakomi: it dont matter since they're getting the parts stolen. So just give the wheels to cam for 95$ each
[8:46:49] yoshimitzu54: it would make sense irl
[8:46:50] totelol: are you calling us stupid ? graycenW
[8:46:52] theJOATx: 2Head
[8:46:56] yoshimitzu54: cause its not easy to clean money
[8:47:03] bonziatv: you‚Äôre an asshole

[8:47:32] straxem: smh
[8:47:43] brjnoqo3kd: when is graycen supposed to pay us to watch him again chat?
[8:47:59] TheLadyCupcake: what do you get for the wheel?
[8:48:01] GnarlyDavidson: yo @graycen you get the house yet or nah
[8:48:08] bobiehd: he wanted to take a chopped wheel and do a job with it to get 120-180 for it? you get 120 - the clean cut
[8:48:24] TheLadyCupcake: @Graycen he said he would give you $120 for the wheel
[8:48:36] XThAcReEpErX: wheel 120 wheel job 120-180 minus 35 for wheel vs give came a wheel for only 120-180
[8:48:37] TheLadyCupcake: so he doesnt spend $35
[8:48:43] Freddiepines: Dentge
[8:48:44] danknesss4207: you get clean money though, ez money
[8:48:48] Jeff_dd: Jeff_dd subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 32 months! 
[8:48:49] DuckSmoke_: CHAT! Why would he pay Gary 120 when he could buy it legal for 35???
[8:48:51] SwitchBord001: WHEELS and TIRES are different. Time is the cost of cleaning money.
[8:48:51] TheLadyCupcake: ????
[8:48:51] Sun_Rah: DUMBASS
[8:48:55] Fakomi: Dentge WIDEALERT
[8:48:55] sleeplesswolf94: 95 from sewer money thats been cleaned +85 he made off towing job with cost =180 and half of it u had to clean and wait for.  if he got a free wheel that gives him 190 clean money. yes u lose rep but if rep isnt the factor his nets more money
[8:48:57] bobiehd: he doesn't need to buy it for 35 if you bring it for free?

[8:52:43] Sazaruna: youre saying the total the both of you get from doing both jobs is more, but what chat is saying that youre the one getting more doing it through him
[8:52:45] Its_Parker_Btw: No work today, got that snow snow kek
[8:52:49] DreeamZone: maybe it's about amount of tyres he gets?
[8:52:51] MymicArt: nope I've been tabbed out listening to you bitch at chat
[8:52:58] TheLadyCupcake: so what you're trying to say its more money if he just buys the tire for $35, and you do your tire for $120 dirty
[8:53:09] danknesss4207: @Graycen if it works you sell to tow guys and avoid all the sewer sht
[8:53:17] DuckSmoke_: Graycen obviously he just wants to make less money, that's why he wants to buy the tire from you for 120 instead of 35
[8:53:18] demindrela123: @TheLadyCupcake exactly
[8:53:31] dallas123mn: %100 agree with gray.. I hate to say it why pay 120 for a tire when you can get one for 35

[8:54:54] Sazaruna: the only one it doesnt make sense for is the tow guy, dunno why he would want to buy tires for 120 instead of 35, but for gary, he has more cash at the end of the day
[8:54:56] SwitchBord001: @dallas123mn because WHEELS and TIRES are different
[8:54:56] dankwilliams30: nice nice
