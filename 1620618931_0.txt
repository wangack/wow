[2:16:20] chillmodez: out of your mind if you think LFR s are doign 15s

[2:16:36] Tiraldis: Tiraldis subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 14 months! 
[2:16:44] waguiSan: 15s is top 25% playerbase, i dont think normal raiders are there
[2:16:55] SmygandeFizen: @raldrik Yes but our talent trees alow us to have much a bigger arsenal now which you need to take into account
[2:17:13] Arawn67: Isn't that how it should be? Mythic raid is the hardest content in the game therefore should get the highest level loot.
[2:17:19] waguiSan: season 4 SL
[2:17:19] manmower: less people do 20+ keys than mythic raids
[2:17:25] Aidler: I’m a LFR raider and I never touch any M+… not even 0… lol
[2:17:32] brighadoon: Top 25% is a lot
[2:18:00] EnragedGalaxy: try charred passions and bonedust
[2:18:01] Moobot: towHAMUP Follow Towelliee on twitter so you can be in the know at all times! | twitter.com/towelthetank towKawaii
[2:18:02] raye_gaming22: @waguiSan and they dont deserv the highest loot  sounds about right
[2:18:38] SmygandeFizen: Well if you can't do a +20 then you wont get that level of loot, it makes sense, you shouldn't be awarded with loot from the hardest challanges in the game for doing something you can faceroll after like a week to 4
[2:19:15] raye_gaming22: you can 3 man  2chest 15s and you cant to that as a 5 man team you may just hands diffed
[2:19:21] manmower: what is the hardest challenge in WoW? high end raiding right?
[2:19:25] TheGiant99: @SmygandeFizen pretty elitest of you to say
[2:19:35] Darmonevil: Does Fatal touch in the class tree still cost 4 points for 2?
[2:19:49] Skizzurp: have you tried stackin gup for the orbs shooting out part of thundering?
[2:19:49] WoWEnder: get an evoker for the squad
[2:20:27] manmower: I think as long as specs are balanced in M+ this new scheme will work, can't have that warlock/rogue meta anymore
[2:20:30] SmygandeFizen: @TheGiant99 No not at all, you should be awarded to the level you play at, if i do 25+ and CE raiding then someone who only does +15 and HC or maybe 1 or 2 mythic bosses should not have the same loot
[2:20:37] codyxmillz: in your opinion, how would you say dk tanking is in DF? havent seen anything for dragonflight yet
[2:20:38] raye_gaming22: hands diff is a LoL term  for "bad hands" "skill issue"
[2:20:43] Revoca: why not let ppl get op in their pve game
[2:20:46] SmygandeFizen: This isn't comunism, you get rewarded for what you put in
[2:21:00] Aevas: bUt I pAy A sUb I dEsErVe SaMe lOOTz As rAiDeRzz
[2:21:06] manmower: but WoW isn't a skill-based game
[2:21:06] TacDuc: You get OP by being lucky...
[2:21:15] joeyfontana: I can’t play as much anymore and not raid often, I expect to have less than a raider
[2:21:15] TotallyNotRaien: the dumb thing is that... they make the scaling... give them top loot for a harder challenge, idk why m+ loot is locked like 3 ilvls below mythic raid
[2:21:16] ThaOriginalGamester: what's wrong with being semi-op? 😭
[2:21:33] Rev_4_Life: there needs to be something to get players into the raid but also not undermine the 3 pillars.
[2:21:47] pereadin: I'll probably unsub if its hard Kappa
[2:21:51] WolfofWarSong: im find with the ilvl changes i just dont think they need to increase the scaling
[2:21:54] manmower: a 25 key should give higher ilevel than mythic raid
[2:21:54] Crisis88: @Towelliee How do you think the change will affect the market value for paying for gold runs?
[2:22:03] Menion01: There is also no borrowed power to boost people this expansion...
[2:22:21] ChrisarN: is thundering the worst affix ever added ?
[2:22:26] Aidler: I never understood why you need to be good in a game they expect you to pay for… but that’s just me

[2:22:30] Crisis88: @manmower No, dungeons should never give higher then raids.
[2:22:33] Admiller0: @TotallyNotRaien replayable content looting should not equal mythic weekly lockout loot.. it just shouldnt
[2:22:34] Raff12345: What’s the build look like?
[2:22:48] pereadin: +10 Towelliee Group is the name of the group in LFD chat.  Please note iif you're from stream
[2:22:55] Simplypewpew: rip melee in in the first dragonflight season?
[2:22:58] SmygandeFizen: @ChrisarN Close, it is pretty shit, not to hard as you just dodge, but feels very awkward and shitty
[2:23:04] 91Niki: "I'm dc'ed healing" ijpHMM
[2:23:04] TotallyNotRaien: @Admiller0 then lock it behind the vault?
[2:23:24] Skizzurp: thundering def feels shit
[2:23:30] manmower: the kiss is the stun
[2:23:37] Molvonos: It's curse/curse.  Aka 'fuck you in particular' affix
[2:23:43] SmygandeFizen: @Aidler Are you trolling?
[2:23:44] manmower: if you stun your teammates you move up on the meters
[2:23:46] ChrisarN: it is TERRIBLE for melee grps
[2:23:59] Molvonos: What.
[2:24:03] SphinxyOCE: ?
[2:24:06] Revoca: lol what
[2:24:09] Darmonevil: @Towelliee You might want to check Fatal Touch.... it is supposedly bugged and costs 4 talents points for 2 points
[2:24:09] 댜다_지석: that comment makes zero sense
[2:24:10] dinomiyte: lmao... what?
[2:24:11] raye_gaming22: you pay to assec the servers
[2:24:13] TnTsKyHiGh: I'm confused
[2:24:14] N3llee: what kind of moron plays games to not be good?
[2:24:15] TotallyNotRaien: i honestly felt that
[2:24:15] Raff12345: What do you feel is better currently, brew or prot?
[2:24:20] Kneckt: they want the game to be easier since u pay for it
[2:24:24] Skizzurp: they dont expect you to be good but generally in mmos getting the good things requires some element of talent
[2:24:25] cigarette_butter: damn yall are toxic
[2:24:29] pereadin: +10 Towelliee Group iin LFD chat. Put note if you're from stream
[2:24:30] TotallyNotRaien: @N3llee some people, and this may be crazy, play to have fun
[2:24:33] Moobot: tedol, Just for the time being we will be automatically removing any "Pay to Win" comments regardless of context to clean up chat. Sorry for the inconvenience!
[2:24:37] zeeAbe: To be fair, they clearly want to tune the difficulty in M+ up a lot. Plus we were complaining about borrowed power, so in totally Blizzard move they went "OH WE ARE GONNA REMOVE EVERY PIECE OF BORROWED POWER THEN!"
[2:24:42] manmower: they are trying to make the game less hardcore to attract back playerbase
[2:24:48] tedol: right, that word still banned
[2:24:48] Moobot: I will be leveling a toon on the NA Fresh Server Maladath (Normal) 8/30. 3-4 Day Mini-Thon for Launch. Gonna hit Max Level and get some quick gear!
[2:24:51] BlewGamingGroup: youre renting pixels

[2:24:55] Revoca: yep you just rent the game
[2:25:01] TotallyNotRaien: blizzard is an awful landlord
[2:25:05] Labott: Scary thought***
[2:25:05] Aidler: @smygandefizen no I’m definitely not but no need to argue. I get not many people think like that
[2:25:06] SmygandeFizen: @N3llee Yee but playing to have fun doesn't = getting everything handed to them tho
[2:25:25] N3llee: cant imagine paying to play a gain to suck and get your ass beat everytime. At one point is that fun?

[2:25:38] Digitaldragon754: Was hoping to work my character for 500 yrs :D
[2:25:39] Quojin: No its MY character do you hear, MINE!! lol
[2:25:55] TheGiant99: @SmygandeFizen you really have a issue with what others get when it doesnt directly effect you at al....
[2:25:55] manmower: if he doesn't keep up 3k rating he doesn't get his inheritence
[2:25:58] Molvonos: "To my grandson, I leave my [THUNDERFURY, BLESSED BLADE OF THE WINDSEEKER]"
[2:25:59] mikejames01: GOOD gear does not make you good
[2:26:00] tedol: Family char that was made in classic
[2:26:02] ItsDerpDiggler: That "Why do I have to be good?" mentality is the reason they started to 'dumb things down' in a sense in the first place... It essentially ruined it for the people who enjoyed the game being a little challenging just because others felt they should get everything "Handed" to them since they pay a sub...
[2:26:15] 91Niki: @mikejames01 Truth
[2:26:22] mikejames01: seen so many pay for good gear that suck
[2:26:24] tedol: Mop was pretty good for that

[2:26:34] SmygandeFizen: @TheGiant99 Well yee it bothers me that some people expect to get the top tier stuff without doing anything for it, that makes 0 sense lol
[2:26:44] raye_gaming22: never forget mythic table boxes lol
[2:26:58] pereadin: that's been my issue and why I've been spotty with me playing WoW in general.  I'd play a lot more if I had a set group/tank to play with and push with.
[2:27:08] Revoca: just get add on and a strict GL you too can do mythics
[2:27:14] TheGiant99: @SmygandeFizen but at the end of the day it doesnt directly effect you so why worry about it
[2:27:40] tedol: when titan forging was added?
[2:27:42] Menion01: No DF :(
[2:27:44] manmower: well they're gonna attract the dragon-people demographic, should bring the numbers up a bit
[2:27:54] ditaern: @iAmDerpDiggler If people want a 'challenging' why even have rewards for completing it. Doing the content should be reward enough
[2:28:03] Eviltuna13: Hardest part of Wrath is choosing what 25 dailies to do
[2:28:06] ItsDerpDiggler: @Towelliee Yeah I don't mean the Wrath casual though, I mean even the later xpacs giving away legendaries etc lol
[2:28:11] SymphonyOnIce: bring emblem vendors to retailllll
[2:28:36] Quahoon: so pre wrath is non casual in terms of skill level? XD
[2:28:39] xxsargexx: nah lol
[2:28:39] Xelim27: remember back in 2004 wow was the casual mmorpg in the market @Towelliee
[2:28:41] Aevas: Balance of Power account wide this expansion please Blizz
[2:28:52] ItsDerpDiggler: @iAmDerpDiggler Not true, do the challenge and earn it
[2:28:59] papaherc: the game is too hard without addons
[2:29:23] manmower: i think addons should be disabled in raids and m+
[2:29:29] tedol: @Xelim27  had you grinded for res pots?
[2:29:45] doomester: @Towelliee this change to the 15s and 20s going to affect alts as well
[2:29:57] starknadooo: Has it been confirmed that the 20s in DF will be at the same difficulty as season 1-3 of SL?
[2:30:09] ditaern: @iAmDerpDiggler Nah, if the reason you do hard content is for the rewards, and not for the content itself, you're a pretender.
[2:30:12] raye_gaming22: @Xelim27 it has always been casual,  my server has 20 2 night a week 6hr CE guilds not tell me this game is hard
[2:30:18] dracullus: I wonder if they still remember about bad luck protection for ultra rare mounts, we had blue post last February about it
[2:30:39] tedol: yea, in 2004, when you died you not losing exp, that was reason why people called it casual
[2:31:05] TheGiant99: @SmygandeFizen but it still doesn't effect you at all directly so who cares

[2:38:48] mikejames01: this is why i made 3 setups on my tress to sue
[2:38:53] mikejames01: trees
[2:39:04] SilkeySmooth: full talent inspection required for m+
[2:39:11] Warcraft_Whims: Yeah and if 2 of those cinderbolts hit the same target like a hunter, they just die lol
[2:39:23] Blvdman: Are there gear vendors or M+ just auto scales you in beta
[2:39:37] Exxcar: Interrupts should be baseline and the talents should affect CD or reward for successful interrupt

[3:01:18] ItsDerpDiggler: @iAmDerpDiggler Very good in my book lol I hate GDKP
[3:01:19] 91Niki: @GarfielfArbuncle Depends on what race you play. It can be boney, fluffy, or beefy. Can even be green if you want to
[3:01:45] ItsDerpDiggler: I feel people should just roll on gear with priority going to tank for any tanking gear and healers for any healing gear as it used to be.
[3:01:55] Twigz_KC: you going to watch MNF tonight?
[3:02:03] ItsDerpDiggler: Only upgrades should be rolled on
[3:02:03] CrusaderNero: hows DF looking? More important, hows the Paladin?

[3:02:13] bymz: I haven’t seen many ww on beta streams. How’s that class doing?
[3:02:29] GarfielfArbuncle: @GarfielfArbuncle Well I'm thinking tauren so a bit of fluffy and a bit of beefy.
[3:02:37] smashwow: WW slappin
[3:02:39] pereadin: This is my last one though T. Wife needs me to take her somewhere and i'll be back after about an hour or so.

[3:03:45] Xatrixius: they're never done with bear Towelie
[3:03:51] CrusaderNero: im just gonna dump my main(paladin) and chillax as a BM hunter.
[3:04:03] zeeAbe: I like the "We don't have time, oh by the way here is a new class" approach.
[3:04:24] Phil87z: Cries in Shadow priest
[3:04:47] CrusaderNero: whens the pre patch?
[3:04:58] CrusaderNero: ooh maybe announce tomorrow :)
[3:05:40] Sollice: I cant tell if I love or hate the first DF raid tier sets. Color wise they are great
[3:05:51] Sollice: The DK set I dunno. First I feel like hasnt been a home run
[3:06:20] 91Niki: @Sollice I really miss tier sets being way more class specific
[3:07:11] 91Niki: Not a huge fan of the same overall theme with just class theme for their shapes
[3:07:23] Sollice: Yea they went to a more raid themed design. Which I can understand. I guess it puts things in a more thematic way but I dunno feels more generic
[3:07:23] TheGiant99: @Sollice I agree i dont the class theme thing. I wish they where all class unique
[3:07:50] 91Niki: Yeah what Giant said. I want the class unique tier sets back
[3:08:04] TheGiant99: Each class should look diff
[3:08:13] 91Niki: Yeah
[3:08:18] Sollice: They need a new DH armor designer though. I have never liked any of them
[3:08:39] Youredoneson666: surv hunter not lookin to hot
[3:08:55] TheGiant99: Yea Solice they did better with unique monk sets when they came out then the did with the DH sets
[3:09:04] 91Niki: It feels a little lazy with them overall having the same look, with slightly different shapes to fit each class. Rather than unique looks for each class
[3:09:22] Sollice: Yea. It's a stupid reason I guess but I love DH but their armor really kinds of makes me not want to play it
[3:09:38] Sollice: @91Niki The should effects for mythic feels very lazy for sure. Its all the same thing
[3:09:47] 91Niki: Yeah
[3:10:09] Skizzurp: also im rusty asf

[3:19:08] 91Niki: I am really really enjoying both!
[3:19:15] charlie_the_snowman: @Towelliee you can binge RoP , pretty good binge show
[3:19:20] Rakim88: ring of power last 2 episode OH BOI hype
[3:19:22] SymphonyOnIce: lol
[3:19:36] TheGiant99: RoP is soi much better then HoD......they jump to far ahead ever episode in Dragons for me
[3:19:40] Ertra: what are those blue swirly pools?
[3:19:49] Ertra: is that the seasonal affix along with the orbs around you?
[3:19:52] 91Niki: @Ertra Seasonal affix
[3:19:54] charlie_the_snowman: I like both RoP and HoD
[3:20:00] abracka_: i enjoy the story building/world telling with RoP far more than house of dragon
[3:20:03] charlie_the_snowman: not sure why RoP has such bad reviews, I like it
[3:20:11] Rakim88: @TheGiant99 disagree, i like both but HoD is ahead
[3:20:14] 91Niki: @Charlie_The_Snowman Review bombing
[3:20:28] rymerre: @Towelliee do you have links to your background music playlists?
[3:20:35] 91Niki: New trend amongst bored people. Review bomb shows
[3:20:36] charlie_the_snowman: HoD is ahead in reviews too
[3:20:38] TheGiant99: 100% review bombing......its 2022 its cool to be negative about everything
[3:20:51] charlie_the_snowman: fuck reviews
[3:20:52] Rakim88: @Charlie_The_Snowman cause black elfs duh Kappa
[3:21:04] 91Niki: Yeah, bored people sitting at home having nothing better to do than review bombing stuff
[3:21:05] charlie_the_snowman: @Rakim88 LUL
[3:21:29] TheGiant99: Tea people didnt like the black elf thing....but come on really does it matter
[3:21:29] 91Niki: I wish I had that much free time
[3:21:41] camslam: Yeah weird negative press out of the gate. Loved every episode, even the halfling song
[3:21:51] KaisenSiru: anniesHmm yyjHmm
[3:22:07] Urebaldd: I've loved it so far too, didn't understand the hate
[3:22:08] iloveyalunn: "critics" will always say a show sucks
[3:22:14] Rakim88: @TheGiant99 u dont understand they changed so much of the story Kappa peter jackson never changed anything at all lotr at all Kappa
[3:22:49] tumb_tack: !DTF
[3:22:54] jetributions: did they tune that boss yet
[3:22:58] TheGiant99: @rakim so what its a TV show.....ive been a Tolkien fan since I was 10 and Im now 52.....it doesnt really matter at the end of the day skin color
[3:22:59] 91Niki: I just watch stuff and having a good time doing so SeemsGood idk what's so hard about that
[3:23:21] charlie_the_snowman: @TheGiant99 true
[3:23:28] abracka_: @TheGiant99 think he's just trolling
[3:23:34] camslam: It's the same book-lore wierdos that feel like theyre soul is tarnished if the book and movies dont match word for word
[3:23:41] camslam: miss me with that shit
[3:23:46] Rakim88: @abracka_ maybe Kappa
[3:23:50] TheGiant99: Plus l;ast time I checked the books didnt say. Every Elf was white
[3:24:11] abracka_: @Rakim88 towStop towIt
[3:24:22] tumb_tack: have to admit that dragon looks bad ass..
[3:24:25] 91Niki: @camslam Yeah, that's also the people who don't understand that you can't possibly fit the length and detail of a book into a movie or tv show without it being ridiculously long
[3:24:46] Rakim88: ring of powers is doing a good job of handling lore considering they dont have access to 1st age stuff
[3:24:48] camslam: @91Niki 1000%
[3:24:49] TheGiant99: So true Niki
[3:25:13] charlie_the_snowman: grats
[3:25:35] KaisenSiru: Whelpling Pog
[3:25:50] charlie_the_snowman: I think they did a great job with the pacing in RoP. Doesnt get boring.
[3:26:02] GamerGoat56: 18+ expac when?
[3:26:06] Rakim88: WAYTOODANK combine what?
[3:26:10] 91Niki: @Charlie_The_Snowman Agreed! I am really enjoying it

[3:27:50] TheGiant99: Niki I went back and watch the first movie and its cool because you see stuff from RoP
[3:28:01] Rakim88: @Charlie_The_Snowman pacing is a bit slow ish but considering its going to possibly be 5 season is plan. should be fine i guess. HoD is going fast cause they r doing more than just dance with dragon, they r doing all the lore for targaryen.
[3:28:07] 91Niki: @TheGiant99 I watched them during watch parties with JP. It was good fun!
[3:28:08] KogharTV: enhancement shaman is my favorite spec theyre so fun
[3:28:13] kone_malone: @nabysco Just came in is enh lookin rough?
[3:28:15] TheGiant99: And you hear names and stuff from RoP
[3:28:22] Skizzurp: we took 5 melee also so yea ranged hunter woulda been better there
[3:28:36] heydjzs: im stuck on what i want to play for df
[3:28:37] Energyzer9301: Ret paladins are gonna look at Shamans like ''first time?'' after the nerfs LUL
[3:28:38] charlie_the_snowman: @Rakim88 damn 5 seasons? didnt know that
[3:28:38] 91Niki: @TheGiant99 I might watch them all again once the show is over
[3:28:42] jetributions: how are brewmaster and prot warrior looking?
[3:28:43] Rev_4_Life: generally from past experience  the shaman dev likes to go mia for long periods of time so if they are busted there is a chance they stay that way
[3:28:58] Rakim88: @Charlie_The_Snowman rumored not confirmed
[3:29:09] TheGiant99: same
[3:29:13] Kinghorn: gj blizz
[3:29:18] abracka_: ele has been in shell shock crying in the corner for the last few expansions

[3:30:01] willie_zenn: Mid
[3:30:04] tiyanigean: it was fine but never meta
[3:30:13] SockpuppetzEnh: enhance has been a bottom tier spec since throne of thunder
[3:30:20] willie_zenn: Unfortunately
[3:30:21] AMadAgha: enh was bad in every exp befor
[3:30:22] ogboodha: when the beofre the earthquake lego nerf ele was prime
[3:30:25] pereadin: aight T, i'll be back in a few to run more if you're running more by then
[3:30:27] zeeAbe: Ele did good damage but the issue is that the class brings NOTHING that says "You have to bring these"
[3:30:28] willie_zenn: I just rerolled lol
[3:30:29] charlie_the_snowman: @Rakim88 Amazon spent 500 million for the 1st season of RoP. Pretty insane.
[3:30:32] starknadooo: It was okay. Enhance was good in PvP till the nerf of chain harvest
[3:30:36] sqknarf: good luck to your yankees, just saw they have the guardians next. hoping for a good series.
[3:30:37] willie_zenn: b

[3:32:06] ZombieMessiah: I want my revenge for 2001 against the Yanks :D
[3:32:12] ItsDerpDiggler: @willie_zenn They do it because of the bugged out loading where the other team is loading in right in front of you so everyone is spamming AoE's causing others to lag out... So others keep saying "Bruh..."
[3:32:14] TheGiant99: @Towelliee why doint you want the Astros to play the Yanks

[3:34:03] TheGiant99: @Towelliee if its Yanks/Stros you wanna make a friendly wager
[3:34:19] Fedratsailor: seattle/new york would be cool, seattle lost to them back in the ALCS before the drought.

[3:42:31] yeti82: biggere then normal rep grind ?
[3:42:33] JessaCat1000: @Towelliee Do we know when the Prepatch will drop? I want to see how long I have until the 50% Xp Boost goes away.
[3:42:34] Skizzurp: im surprised there isnt a mission table like thing tbh
[3:42:35] TheGiant99: always something to do will be nice
[3:42:51] tiyanigean: the higher rep needed kinda turns the higher renown levels into  guaranteed paragon chest stuff
[3:43:26] duartz89: wait the coins show up on the map automatically now?
[3:43:45] Dragonkiller1974: there are a few that is that way
[3:44:15] Daganatv: Chat, how early do you get flying in DF?
[3:44:51] Mourningztar: I've challenged my guild to a race to 70, you think it would be faster to get the points for flying first or during.
[3:44:56] JessaCat1000: Does anyone know when the Prepatch will drop? Just wanted to know how long the 50% Xp boost is done.
[3:45:06] Skizzurp: i think its like late level 61 early level 62 ish prob
[3:45:14] tumb_tack: Its gated behind 45 minutes?? WTF blizzard have respect for our time.
[3:45:22] SpoofAvatar: right behind the curve is a good spot
[3:45:26] ConradN7: @mourningztar do 95% of the dragonriding glyphs first before doing levelling
[3:45:26] CullenPrime: I heard some people quit playing the beta because it was too hard to level their dragon riding.
[3:45:51] nitemare34godd: @Towelliee alt v someone told me in beta
[3:45:51] Fedratsailor: will admit getting the glyphs done earlier will be a huge benefit.
[3:45:56] doomester: @Towelliee any idea what are you going to main or is it still unknowm?
[3:45:59] nitemare34godd: it got mine to work
[3:46:06] ConradN7: the dragon riding levelling is actually quite easy with addons... problem is... with addons. without them, it takes ages
[3:46:09] Mourningztar: @ConradN7 Okay, I havent got beta yet so I cant test lol
[3:46:13] MuzzledWalnut: Hows prot paladin feeling? Thinking about getting back into tanking but can't decide which one i want to use
[3:46:14] nitemare34godd: or shift v
[3:46:17] nitemare34godd: i cant rememebr
[3:46:22] nitemare34godd: ok
[3:46:27] CordovaGC: its ctrl v
[3:46:31] CordovaGC: @Towelliee
[3:46:45] chefjayare: mine is just v and shift v
[3:46:49] Suwah84: Yo Luxthos let you get a taste of the WA early???
[3:47:10] Hazmatiq: Hazmatiq subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 7 months! just happy to be here coach
[3:47:28] TheGiant99: Some are tough at the start
[3:47:34] ConradN7: yeah, pretty much that. you don't need to cap dragonriding but get all except like last 2 talents
[3:47:41] JessaCat1000: @Towelliee When do you think the Pre Patch will drop?
[3:48:07] MarquisLek: in accordance to the leaks  its 25th
[3:48:14] JessaCat1000: Sweet, so I have a while before the 50% XP buff will go away.
[3:48:17] jetributions: the highest point in the dragon isles yeah screw that
[3:48:26] Subjektive: saw a gnome named gnomlyfans lol

[3:48:39] abracka_: just wait, they'll find a way
[3:48:48] Lazugo: they have the pylon that you activate in the campaign
[3:48:48] Youredoneson666: unless they lock the talent tree behind a certain number of weeks
[3:48:49] ConradN7: I did the highest peak in dragon Isles. took me like 10 mins going back and forth to hit the peak LUL
[3:48:54] duartz89: Don't give em ideas lol
[3:48:56] Youredoneson666: like row 4 doesn't unlock for 4 weeks after xpac drops
[3:49:03] jaina8675309: have to the story first?
[3:49:24] mrturtletoad: rep from story matter?
[3:49:50] ConradN7: you get the Dragon mount like lvl 61 or 62
[3:50:11] jaina8675309: 60
[3:50:34] ConradN7: Well dragon... wyvern mount, but kinda same LUL
[3:50:36] Youredoneson666: you get dragonriding like 40 minutes into the xpac
[3:51:02] Subjektive: if you do all side quest before the campaign it will take like 2 hours to get the mount
[3:51:07] mrturtletoad: 39 in your pro
[3:51:17] ConradN7: it takes till like 61/62 to get to dragon riding LUL
[3:51:41] TheGiant99: Yea if you want dragon riding the fastest dotn do any side quests
[3:51:46] Tiamarilien: I think I was 61, but I lollygagged and did some side quests omw to ruby life pools where I was given the first drake
[3:52:04] TheGiant99: I put a bug report in for that area last night
[3:52:33] Graymyst: You get the dragon at 61 on your main unless you block XP
[3:52:35] Qoax: I just want to know, if I can gear a toon to ilvl 300 in prepatch. Like if blizzard stops mythic + with expansion?
[3:52:38] EnragedGalaxy: in your opinion what's the best tank balanced between DPS and defensiveness?
[3:52:54] Graymyst: Then you get all the glyphs in around 20min if you know the route and be done with it :)
[3:53:12] Subjektive: gonna be tough to get all the glyphs when they locked some of the big abilities like the barrel roll behind finishing the zones
[3:53:20] ConradN7: ngl tho, while expa is looking fairly well, recent changes look kinda worrying. like tier sets being focused than open and mythic + losing a positive affix NotLikeThis
[3:53:36] TheGiant99: Im gonna do every quest on my first play through i think
[3:53:42] Subjektive: only way i could climb the apex is with barrel roll
[3:53:48] Dragonkiller1974: will be best to group up for the quest to kill the drakes that are elites
[3:53:49] Graymyst: @Subjektive nah it's really ez trust me, i made a video where i get all in 22min with the starting dragon
[3:54:18] Graymyst: it wasnt even optimal
[3:54:31] dracullus: do we know if renown is account wide or not?
[3:54:37] ConradN7: @subjektive use fly up and have minimal flight drop to upkeep high speed and repeat. it worked for me Kappa
[3:54:39] TheGiant99: right now ive done every quest in the first 2 areas abd I am level 4 with the 2 factions
[3:56:03] ChrisarN: what is rock climbing?
[3:56:17] ConradN7: that highest point is easy if you exploit minimal height lowering. ie keep angle at 183° Kappa
[3:56:22] Fedratsailor: world quest
[3:56:35] TheGiant99: Im doing it just for the fun of it
[3:56:35] Graymyst: you really only need 7 glyphs for questing tbh. But since it's ez enough to get all why bother limiting yourself :)
[3:56:37] abracka_: would be so cool if they tied in a profession to rock climbing... wonder what they could call such a profession
[3:56:47] Dragonkiller1974: @Towelliee what is you thoughts on the dragon racing?
[3:56:59] Fedratsailor: 500g from each dragonriding world quest atm.
[3:57:33] Fedratsailor: 50k
[3:57:33] Moobot: I will be leveling a toon on the NA Fresh Server Maladath (Normal) 8/30. 3-4 Day Mini-Thon for Launch. Gonna hit Max Level and get some quick gear!
[3:57:42] TheGiant99: @Towelliee did you notice in beta they only go to 25 but the cheeve is for 30
[3:57:44] Elderpug27: thats cray
[3:57:46] happyspot: As a casual mainly solo player I'm looking forward to it lol
[3:57:52] its_mr_duck: what is that called?
[3:57:52] lockruss182: PogChamp
[3:57:53] Mourningztar: Im marathoning this with you. See If I can beat ya
[3:57:59] Hill_Jack: seems like lazy content creation
[3:58:06] SilkeySmooth: there has to be a grind in the dragonflight and rep is it
[3:58:43] Hill_Jack: i just hear rep grind and cringe
[3:58:44] KaisenSiru: YEP
[3:58:51] ryanmarkkkk: brother, you don't know how happy it makes me when I hop on twitch and still see you rocking out. started watching you yearssssssss ago
[3:58:59] ConradN7: my main worry still lies in a few talent trees and tad too many tier bonuses. especially fury warrior
[3:59:22] ryanmarkkkk: I remember you had mugs on a shelf behind you does that sound right?
[3:59:24] ChrisarN: are there power in the rep grinds?

[3:59:41] FuzzyGrendel: Is it account wide? Do all alts work towards the rep rewards? That would actually make it interesting.
[4:00:06] ChrisarN: is it account wide?
[4:00:35] Darthyrevan: towCopium towCopium towCopium
[4:00:38] ConradN7: @thegiant99 problem is, around 3/4 of the tier sets have already been reworked, while a fourth was ignored.
[4:00:51] Aidler: I probably have no other way to get to items with this ilvl
[4:00:53] Dragonkiller1974: the dragon glyphs are
[4:00:58] tiyanigean: as far i understand the rewards are account wide, not the rep itself?
[4:01:55] ChrisarN: sucks
[4:02:02] Tyrsfal: Tyrsfal subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 32 months! 
[4:02:37] ChrisarN: swtor has all achievments account wide
[4:02:38] zeeAbe: Paragoooooooooooons
[4:02:46] MarquisLek: because wrathion and sabellion are different reps?
[4:02:52] MrGM: I guess to play devil's advocate here, someone could make a bunch of alts and farm the same side quests to get a ton of rep if it was account wide
[4:03:09] Moobot: towBleedpurple towGold Thanks for supporting The Hammer Squad by watching these 3 minutes of commercials! towGold You also have the option to subscribe to further plant yourself in our community and no longer see ads! towUp towBleedpurple
[4:03:19] jkitchin75: so its going to suck on alts awsome
[4:03:23] Kelticlore: I heard there considering the Older rep potentially becoming account wide
[4:03:24] ChrisarN: then just have a weekly rep cap....
[4:03:28] zeeAbe: Make it account wide but each quest only gives rep once per account
[4:03:29] MrGM: but I do think once you're 30 on one you should get 30 on your alts
[4:03:30] MarquisLek: i farmed reps in legion for paragon chest mounts
[4:04:00] tiyanigean: @ChrisarN hell no, you want to be able to farm rep whenever you feel like it, not when the game says "now you may"
[4:04:05] SherriJade: SherriJade subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 7 months! towHAMUP towHAMUP towHAMUP
[4:04:09] bamorgan13: Is the main difference the direct rewards and activities like world quests vs the vendor access rewards like recipes/gear?
[4:04:10] ChrisarN: weekly rep cap then
[4:04:24] herpidiink: Last I saw, gear and profession recipes are character locked, but most of the cosmetic stuff is account wide like “you need a character on this account with x rep”
[4:04:53] Crisis88: Do you have to farm up the resources on alts? That could be the limiting factor.
[4:05:13] Ludicruz: @Towelliee  no weapons / transmog skins from these vendors ?
[4:05:16] Crisis88: If resources not shared, let us buy whatever when we have rank.
[4:05:33] TheGiant99: Have a good night my friend
[4:05:51] VonShank: you think bs would be pretty good for DH?
[4:05:57] VonShank: or enchanter
[4:06:53] Kneckt: makes sense
[4:07:03] ChrisarN: blizzard logic....
[4:07:07] doomester: @Towelliee and we say that DF is alt Friendly?
[4:07:18] Kneckt: they should if they wanna be pro everything
[4:07:31] jkitchin75: nope
[4:08:24] TheGiant99: At the end of the day it just always gives you something to do no matter what charater you play
[4:08:45] LoseAlotLuke: are these renown things important?>
[4:09:00] jkitchin75: no
[4:09:31] ChrisarN: but then u can't rock climb instantly on an alt...,
[4:09:34] SilkeySmooth: your going to be grinding alts anyway
[4:09:47] Sadisticmedic: towLets towGo
[4:09:49] koko316: towHAMUP towHAMUP towHAMUP towHAMUP
