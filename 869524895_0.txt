[0:53:51] Molvonos: @Towelliee I've been thinking about Lula's issue. Did you buy the stigia upgrades for Torg? And did Lula? She might be missing some of those key upgrades that give her better anima power choices.
[0:53:59] Deltros123: What are your thoughts on prot pally this xpac?
[0:54:02] ukladd: is it a good time to jump back into wow? after not playing for like 6 years
[0:54:06] schneizeII: hi guys Twisting Corridors it will close at the reset ?
[0:54:10] Ryok: @josh8555 yeah idk maybe i just don't know how to play vengance D: but at like floor 16 most elite stuff would just oneshot me and the times i got to the last boss it was the observer boss which then proceeded to oneshot me at like 5 stacks of the elite buff with his spam cast
[0:54:22] MrGattz: @schneizeell nope, shouldnt be
[0:54:26] Alastree: @ukladd I play casually on and off and Shadowlands is great so far
[0:54:42] MOLAR305: there was like a full week where Les was running keys with lux every day ;)
[0:54:57] Ryok: i just spent like 13 hours trying to solo layer 8, then i looked for a group
[0:55:09] NettyGC: check dungeon finder
[0:55:10] Gluwc: only shows when you have 4+
[0:55:14] Naturalbeef: I hate Shadowlands. They made too many awesome specs so I can't stick to any class for very long

[0:57:38] gtmax69: @ukladd The heroics aren't bad. Only need 170ilvl for LFR. The covenant gear/crafted can get you there pretty quick

[0:58:17] Medobolt: 2nd? i see more wipes in the nerco KEKW
[0:59:12] ukladd: @gtmax69 Cheers! I've been hovering over the Shadowlands buy button for past 3 days, might have to just go ahead and start a new character from scratch

[0:59:40] onimbou: thought you were pally for life
[0:59:43] TheUnknowing: He did @onimbou
[0:59:52] onimbou: :o
[0:59:54] nihav: NW boss are not that much of a issue its the trash that hurts
[0:59:55] rhkka: spires and mists are chill keys
[1:00:06] TheUnknowing: Well you see, pally currently suffers from being hit like a truck @onimbou
[1:00:12] Medobolt: I Get invited as bear a lot of the time KEKW
[1:00:29] gtmax69: @ukladd You wont regret it. From scratch? Never been a better time to run 1-50 with the level resets. You can choose the x-pac you wont to do (time-walking)
[1:00:47] Sals_a: There's Larion in Elysian hold what leaves your right front of Spires right?
[1:00:57] ukladd: @gtmax69 do they still do the "catchup" hubs? or is still to early into the expansion?
[1:01:06] BlinkyBill_: when the MDI happens and no one runs anything other than DH they will nerf

[1:01:18] Voidheim: no flight path but you can use the portal system
[1:01:23] Sals_a: Just mob that drops you there
[1:01:24] Medobolt: @BlinkyBill_ say that to prot warr in bfa
[1:01:27] Medobolt: never nerfed KEKW
[1:01:32] MOLAR305: yes there is. next to anima conductor
[1:01:35] Chrissfrosty: its just a cat not flight
[1:01:38] Sals_a: @MOLAR305 Cheers
[1:01:39] gtmax69: @ukladd All I know of is character boosts from the store. Leveling is pretty quick now though
[1:01:47] snoo_32: for prot paladin rather than increasing your armor with shield of righteousness they should make you take a flat 20% damage. I think that would be nice :)
[1:01:48] TheUnknowing: Yeah there is a teleport with the portal system
[1:01:54] Chrissfrosty: left and right side of cov
[1:01:57] rhkka: boost isnt worth the money
[1:01:57] josh8555: idk they have been buffing vs nerfing mostly minus DK lol
[1:02:12] ukladd: @gtmax69 choosing ex-pac that sounds amazing actually :D
[1:02:16] onimbou: Is pally shit now?
[1:02:20] BlinkyBill_: @Medobolt for the fast majority of BFA porot was shit.
[1:02:21] snoo_32: sorry 20% reduced damage* a 20% reduction haha
[1:02:22] DaxxTMI: im lvl 44

[1:03:09] BlinkyBill_: they got changed in season 3? or am i mistaken and it was 2
[1:03:15] cptrogers123: Still figuering out how to play vengeance

[1:03:56] gtmax69: @ukladd any thoughts on the toon you might play?
[1:03:59] Deadly26: I will never give Israel money they helped bomb my country 2 months ago
[1:04:21] Voidheim: Torghast is probably just being timegated so try hards don't burn themselves out with no content left to do
[1:04:26] Molvonos: @Medobolt I doubt they'll nerf DH though. They'll likely buff Pala and the other tanks that are lacking, if how they claim they're gonna treat stuff is any indicator. Huge nerfs are no bueno, they say.
[1:04:28] DarthRektus420: some good ol brew
[1:04:35] rhkka: got alot of torghast to catch up on only just rescued jaina
[1:04:47] CDubTheRIPper: we can dream FeelsBadMan
[1:05:29] Ardailec: I'm honestly surprised they didn't put some cosmetic stuff in Torghast aside from Twisting. It seems like such an easy thing to do.
[1:05:29] Voidheim: INB4 Torghast is the last Raid of the expansion, and the whole raid gets Anima powers as you go farther and farther up

[1:10:21] Malarick: better than no anima
[1:10:23] CrusaderNero: cant be bothered with twisting corridor for campaign either lol
[1:10:50] DarthRektus420: you should get a stack of 35 anima for each level of the key so if level 13, 13 stacks of anima
[1:10:53] letrickyxd: I hate how bad anima feels, all these cosmetics that cost literally tens of thousands and can't get them without committing to a hard farm
[1:10:54] Mafflelol: Set then to Stacking
[1:10:59] Mafflelol: them*
[1:11:09] kroknows101: you can change it in the setting, but stacking isn't much better.
[1:11:09] CritcobainTV: I don't like mine stacked
[1:11:25] Mafflelol: Used to be a "spread" setting, maybe

[1:13:21] letrickyxd: I don't mind if healers don't do a good amount of dps, but just put your DoT up at least lmao
[1:13:29] theoriginalzinng: resto sham have to choose between pressing dps buttons or heal buttons
[1:13:29] Jewishraver: I dps all the time as a holy pally
[1:13:34] 3663Sharad: It depends on the person i guess. Had a druid that pumped dmg but was garbage on the healing
[1:13:36] bostonwinsx: it goes south fast somtimes....
[1:13:39] Affiiance: They need to play FFXIV where its expected for helaers to dps
[1:13:41] theoriginalzinng: means they are just uncomfortable with the spec
[1:13:48] DoubleOhDan1500: iv got ever healer except a shammy and they are all capable of helping dps... its important they do

[1:14:32] bostonwinsx: alot of tanks be kiting latly
[1:14:41] letrickyxd: you HAVE to kite as tank now
[1:14:46] DarthRektus420: yeah im noticing that too
[1:14:47] bostonwinsx: not wrong
[1:14:48] 3663Sharad: Im glad to see even a BrM has to run. Maining a Prot Warrior for years and this season i just hate it

[1:14:56] Jewishraver: I’ve been enjoying holy pally this expansion
[1:15:00] DarthRektus420: yeah idm
[1:15:02] FryeTV: Kiting is fine and it has to be done.
[1:15:03] Affiiance: Hell yeah sometimes you should be kiting
[1:15:13] FryeTV: get over it. Its not patchwerk is how i see it
[1:15:14] DarthRektus420: i enjoy being helpful and helping the tank kite
[1:15:21] rhkka: fortified do be annoying
[1:15:23] Affiiance: Yeah thats always been a thing sometimes
[1:15:32] 3663Sharad: Maybe a nerf to fotifed needed?
[1:15:38] CritcobainTV: No reason not to be kiting. if you can reduce your damage taken to literally zero by kiting, why wouldn't you lol
[1:15:42] letrickyxd: It smooths out in later patches, but kiting is always a thing in early expacs
[1:15:42] 3663Sharad: *Fortified
[1:15:42] murtokqt: Or whole legion meta, dk kiting
[1:15:44] DarthRektus420: gotta look out for the tanky bois
[1:15:46] rhkka: harder than bosses atm
[1:16:04] Affiiance: You better set interrupts up for this double Goliath

[1:24:02] CritcobainTV: Necrotic feels like aids to time if you don't get upstairs with like 12 minutes left. There's so much trash to do upstairs it feels. waiting on the RP for it
[1:24:03] josh8555: kinda like palace of the dead in final fantasy online

[1:46:26] throne_arc: @Towelliee bigger pulls means bigger damage so its good for high keys
[1:46:27] chromaticblurr: Hymnal does crazy dmg as a blue
[1:46:31] FryeTV: The trinket thats AoE from Sang its trash

[1:46:33] CritcobainTV: 5% is a pretty good trinket
[1:46:37] FryeTV: its overtuned in sims
[1:46:39] Scarhearth: decanter is bad in comparison to hymnal
[1:46:43] letrickyxd: Hymnal of the Path, a WQ trinket is so broken
[1:46:47] NeoJon82: Decanter is only good in multiple adds, but they all need to be in a line as it's a narrow patch
[1:46:50] throne_arc: @Towelliee mind usually does around 7-8%
[1:46:51] CritcobainTV: oh, looked like 5 to me lol
[1:46:58] Scarhearth: even on big pulls decanter is trash
[1:47:26] chromaticblurr: My guildy got a purple 184 hymnal and freaked lmao
[1:47:27] 2MakeMe: and we LOVE withered jim didnt we?
[1:47:31] chromaticblurr: it does stupid dmg
[1:47:36] CritcobainTV: Fuck withered jim 😡
[1:47:38] A_SuperSquirrel: Haven't seen trinkets like that since cata
[1:47:54] CritcobainTV: I thought Decanter was better for single target than it is for trash
[1:48:15] CritcobainTV: But im also an idiot and never used it cause it looked bad
[1:48:25] tachos: !playlist
[1:48:42] CritcobainTV: @Towelliee u wanna do my halls?
[1:49:00] Scarhearth: currently my monk uses scale/hymnal. If i have to change out hymnal itd be the sire tank trinket
[1:49:20] Kriven: i have to log out and log in just to get my vault to update properly
[1:49:24] Phoenix88: we need more trinkets like warlords of draenor. esp. the mannoroth trinket for caster or the melee-trinket wie the spirit eruption :D

[1:59:16] Ardennestv: "havoc is fine in keys" as mages do 20k dps pulls every 90 seconds
[1:59:18] Scarhearth: I dont think havoc is that terrible on single target. one of the havoc DHs in my guild pumps every key bring him on tyrannical or fortified doesnt matter still top every run
[1:59:38] letrickyxd: that's a problem with your other dps then
[1:59:56] Almanes: when havoc toping on single target you have bad other dps.. LUL
[1:59:58] 2MakeMe: @Towelliee what is the addon for the missions??
[2:00:06] Ryok: @Almanes i'm also still trying to get into anything above an 11 xD
[2:00:07] ratJAMstan: Just use Meatball!

[2:10:56] snoo_32: is stacking mastery still a thing in SL for Brews ? i know in BFA the dodge was so good for Brews.
[2:11:13] falldrgn: if you have a kick.. use it.. don't matter the role
[2:11:23] Scoodles91: its a dps loss, ain nobody got thime for that
[2:11:29] slipper14: yea but us casters have 24s cd so we got an excuse :)
[2:11:31] thebakeriscomingforu: It is one of the reasons why i use the holy sigil lego on my paladin. extra avenger's shields help interrupt since NO ONE interrupts
[2:11:49] snoo_32: people are not informed - they don't know that kicks and interrupts are off the GCD. They think it will interrupt their dps rotation LUL
[2:11:49] Affiiance: You do have to remember in PUGs interrupts get overlapped a lot more than you think
[2:11:50] FryeTV: @Scoodles91 depending on class its a dps gain to interupt lol
[2:12:02] mmrghost7: they rather wipe and say noob tank than int and lose dps
[2:12:19] Gluwc: dying is bigger dps loss than interrupting
[2:12:23] Masqerader: my favorite @Towelliee is when a pug tank says "can u guys get the patty cake" in mist lol... its a tank only interrupt lol
[2:12:35] Scoodles91: @FryeTV isnt that only DH, that gets extra fury
[2:12:42] nuckinfuts617: Cant dps if youre dead
[2:12:59] snoo_32: interrupting saves lives.

[2:31:42] CritcobainTV: I'll have 2 226, 2 220 and 2 213s. Just cause I don't mythic raid yet, still looking for a guild FeelsBadMan
[2:31:43] Ic3Geek: next reset pvp and campaign is 196
[2:31:47] Zebingt0n: PVP your heart out to catch up
[2:31:48] LtDanAndHisMagicLegs: Campaign gear
[2:31:49] Yerpaysse: get into normal/heroic guild raids
[2:31:50] MrGattz: gear is really really hard to get. like stupid not fun hard to get.
[2:31:55] jeneraljelly: spam M0 and loot up to 184
[2:31:58] deedeemegadoodooo: campaign really helped me gear my alt
[2:31:58] Yerpaysse: if you got a guid, gearing is easy, if completely solo its harder
[2:31:59] Mattsta: it depends on how hardcore you are...covenant gear will be like 197/200 ilvl after this reset
[2:32:00] theoriginalzinng: pvp to 200ish or anima gear from renown
[2:32:03] capricore: Playing the game is a great catch up
[2:32:06] croco_405: i got from lvl1 to 60 with 170 ilvl in 5 days
[2:32:07] raldrik: you can catch up to the top third in 2 weeks
[2:32:11] MurderofPhoenixes: pvP is ez gear
[2:32:13] RocketMan23: completing the last step of your covenant campaign next week you can get upgrade to 200 ilvl pieces
[2:32:20] CritcobainTV: I would do a few mythic 0s right away, and then just farm epic bgs for honor and upgrade pvp gear
[2:32:20] Affiiance: You can upgrade your Covenant armor to 190 now
[2:32:21] metlertoledo: i have 4 60s to 200 i level an capped renown how far am i behind?
[2:32:21] chelsmike88: its 194 pvp gear after the reset
[2:32:22] zSKIz1: but i won't be behind system wise?
[2:32:22] RocketMan23: this week you can get 190 ilvl
[2:32:23] Ryok: i get to choose from 3 220s... i hope i get an upgrade this time D: last 2 vaults were useless
[2:32:27] Dizmal: you can make a macro to show the vault from where ever you are - dont need to be there. @Towelliee
[2:32:35] CritcobainTV: @drateis may as well uninstall LUL you'll never catch up
[2:32:37] CritcobainTV: Kappa
[2:32:38] smashwow: legos are awful to catchup on
[2:32:41] mavus: Covenant gear is already 190
[2:32:46] MurderofPhoenixes: ^
[2:32:50] Firelordxsrx: Thats with rng
[2:32:58] metavahn231: use your own key simple as that
[2:33:21] TrowGundam: The covenant gear is a great "catch up" but getting the anima to upgrade it is a bitch
[2:33:23] SerFloyd: what is the best way to catch up with renown on an alt?
[2:33:28] RocketMan23: ya catching up on renown is pretty easy
[2:33:36] Affiiance: Farming Anima is going to be the annoying part
[2:33:44] RocketMan23: daily callings usually give renown, doing dungeons give renown
[2:33:44] RobNXS: It is tough being time gated though if you just got in to shadowlands
[2:33:48] alexssd: Got my alt from renown 1 to 16 in like 2 days. Easy as that
[2:33:49] MrGattz: covenant gear is a joke though. you out level your covenant gear WELL before you unlock the gear itself
[2:33:50] FosSiLiTate: 3s pvp duh
[2:34:02] capricore: Last week I stalled at renown 19, callings stopped giving it and dungeons didn’t either
[2:34:03] SerFloyd: @alexssd how did you do it?
[2:34:04] Wcvechten: I mean, the first tiers never had catchup mechanics to begin with right
[2:34:10] MurderofPhoenixes: anima is easy, just do daily bgs adn you get some ez
[2:34:23] alexssd: @SerFloyd just follow the campaign quests. And some of the world quest things have renown badges dded as well
[2:34:26] Etines4: Depends on content you do Gattz, I wear most of the pieces on all my toons
[2:34:28] Doog45: holy cow you have a lot of champions
[2:34:30] Antdavs24: @MrGattz tell me about it i just got R6 helm at 190, while i have 200 for weeks already
[2:34:32] SethSteckler: Is that a WA that tells him that?
[2:34:40] Elkahira: uuuuuuh
[2:34:41] Stuey123: what is this addon ?
[2:34:44] cabalish: put all in + healer
[2:34:45] Elkahira: what's that WA/addon??
[2:34:45] WarriorMuffins: @Towelliee that adon doesn't seem to show up in curseforge
[2:34:54] alexssd: @SerFloyd witht he world quests i mean the group ones for the chests you get in your covenant place
[2:34:58] Zonoxx_tv: what addon is that?
[2:34:58] NexusOps: holy crap, there is an addon for the mission table finally?
[2:35:04] CritcobainTV: I got a 15 necrotic wake after that 14 halls FeelsBadMan
[2:35:11] RocketMan23: @MrGattz not on a fresh alt, helped one of my toons get a set of 190 gear
[2:35:12] TrowGundam: @WarriorMuffins Ya it isn't on CurseForge yet. Gotta get it from the author's site for now
[2:35:19] CDubTheRIPper: monkaS
[2:35:20] LtDanAndHisMagicLegs: @WarriorMuffins They chose not to put it up there. It's on their own site
[2:35:22] SethSteckler: Who is the author?
[2:35:26] GoGetItKo: instant
[2:35:28] IxProNoobxI: What add on is that

[2:35:51] Lemirith: I did 3 heroics last night, made around 14k :D
[2:35:55] rhoxt: do you really do HCs for gold my man? @Towelliee
[2:35:56] byrdeen45: hard to get the runes use to get them all the time in past expacs
[2:35:57] TrowGundam: @Creative_Pigeon The weak aura doesn't count abilities
[2:36:19] Mecabeast: wish runes dropped in lfr
[2:36:27] CritcobainTV: they're like 1500g per rune it's nuts
[2:36:33] LtDanAndHisMagicLegs: I get all my runes from table misssions. I have 3 stacks
[2:36:34] Creative_Pigeon: @TrowGundam I'm talking about the tank queue thing
[2:36:38] TrowGundam: I rarely even see the augment bags and I only play healers and tanks. It's annoying
[2:36:43] TrowGundam: @Creative_Pigeon Ahh, gotcha
[2:36:52] rhoxt: @Towelliee dont get me wrong. I find it cool you making your own gold as big steamer, not like others :D
[2:36:58] Scoodles91: no
[2:36:59] byrdeen45: no
[2:37:03] CritcobainTV: Nope, i dont think that's til near the end of xpacs

[2:41:31] Whippedkreme: @Towelliee I was in a Necrotic wake last night and only one person getting the hook on the Dr. knew they were supposed to hook him down...

[2:42:00] danksly: some people enjoy normal dungeons leave em be
[2:42:01] PattyPoo13: Even Asmongold is not playing fury and he is hard to convert
[2:42:06] dimofodi: 2 in my raid team. They're desperate for Tuesday
[2:42:13] mo197: Swifty plays it good
[2:42:19] dimofodi: They get to move out of the dumpster and in to the trash can with Ret
[2:42:22] Creative_Pigeon: imagine being in this group and a 216 tank queues in and just big dicks the damage.
[2:42:26] Meddok: what legendary are you using on your paladin?
[2:42:27] LRY_pinkiepie: warrick23 is continuing the Gift Sub they got from MOLAR305! 
[2:42:38] anithics: arms is just better
[2:42:43] anithics: overall better
[2:42:50] treeshark: reducing rage costs for fury would help
[2:42:51] Masqerader: that's some SNL Stuart Smiley shit. i like me and i will play fury
[2:42:54] Forestrunner201: I thought Fury was in the list for a buff on the 13th
[2:42:57] MOLAR305: woot
[2:43:04] Mattsta: I thought Fury was getting buffed tomorrow
[2:43:12] letrickyxd: Max said that Frost mage was a 8-10% aura damage buff from being a massive funnel dps
[2:43:12] Aro725: They’re getting another big buff tomorrow. I think like 9 percent
[2:43:15] Whippedkreme: fury has too much downtime between skills imo
[2:43:47] KrimsonElite: being a warrior feels bad man
[2:43:48] Aervyper: fury isn't getting buffed enough to move the bar is the early opinion
[2:43:49] Goregan: Heya Squad! Heya Towellie! I got a corsair scimitar since xmas now and ahve to say its so good to tank with. All buttons are easily reachable.
[2:43:56] mo197: watch Swifty play fury
[2:44:11] KrimsonElite: yeah that scale amazingly with gear
[2:44:18] Aervyper: @sirmunja you realize that survival will never EVER EVER bet top tier melee dps EVER
[2:44:20] Coldlight1: usually when they get a ton of extra stuff
[2:44:26] Coldlight1: for fury
[2:44:27] Skizzurp: yea cuz they need the secondary stat scaling off gears be4 they become better
[2:44:29] Sollice: Fury gets an 8% tomorrow. Wonder how that will do
[2:44:35] WarriorMuffins: fury needs haste
[2:44:43] azzurrin: Warriors scale later on
[2:44:48] mo197: 6 heroic jumps
[2:44:50] Masqerader: but end of last expansion, corruption saved them
[2:44:54] grosikx: dont Fury need like 40% haste?
[2:44:59] Pathoren: Pathoren is continuing the Gift Sub they got from rasury123! 
[2:45:04] neut2: sin getting 8% too
[2:45:34] Armdel: @grosikx if i recall correctly haste loses value for fury after 30%
[2:45:39] Hexof: frost mage 9%
[2:45:45] Aervyper: @sirmunja the day that Echo or Limit bring a survival hunter to a mythic first race i'll eat my words..... but i'm not holding my breathe

[4:54:57] Antdavs24: lol the holiday's ended, college starting back up the way it goes
[4:55:00] Shrenko: its not like you miss out on much being offline
[4:55:05] logic_fl: 9.1 news soon?
[4:55:09] Thoriakk: @Towelliee have you installed "Venture Plan" addon for missio table ?
[4:55:10] Vindmolle: our guild on Area-52 has a huge amount of players, one of the biggest guilds ive ever seen
[4:55:12] xideontv: never getting married if this is how honeymoons look like
[4:55:17] Vindmolle: it has 4 guilds to combine as 1
[4:55:20] Thoriakk: i never miss a mission with this
[4:55:21] Its_Me_MG: most of my guild on my alts havent been on for a while now, now my main are daily players
[4:55:25] Wulfgrym: wait..were supposed to get gear in shadowlands?
[4:55:30] KonradGM: @Vindmolle wait list?
[4:55:32] duncon: feel pretty bad for those who can't find cool people to play with.
[4:55:39] Scarhearth: im a casual player and it isnt hard to gear at 205 currently
[4:55:42] Traumfuchs: hi i have to twink a tank for my M+grp. But the Tank will just run M+. What do you think is the best tank for Pushing just with M+ gear and no raiding gear?
[4:55:44] Vindmolle: nah
[4:55:51] sharie: unheard of
[4:55:55] Wulfgrym: must be a theory
[4:56:08] Vindmolle: I love that they made it 1 flask for all this xpac
[4:56:13] KonradGM: i legit think im gonna pay to get boosted in arenas now just to get some gear lul
[4:56:17] Roughneck124: As a casual player I’m stuck at 192 and I’m getting bored.
[4:56:22] vonviktor_: Most of my guildies have become casuals, hard life trying to gear now
[4:56:23] Chimp458: i dont know im pretty casual as well and 200 seems like a hard cap
[4:56:33] Gorestack: don't mind less gear but I've gotten 1 piece of loot from about 25 heroic raid boss kills
[4:56:33] Xilice: I mean you would fully gear except corruptions in 2-3 weeks of 8.3 and m+ became so boring so quickly xD I really like that gearing is slower now
[4:56:37] Vindmolle: im also tempted to pay to get pvp boosted raiting @KonradGM
[4:56:39] thiccsushi: I've got the same back piece from heroic raid as my only piece of loot the last 4 weeks I think im cursed
[4:56:41] Dyriks: I'm a super casual :p
[4:56:43] Chimp458: the tank is much easier to gear than my dps obviously
[4:56:48] Czyszn: im super casual is normal mode raid hard?
[4:56:49] fistofnature: streamer benefits BabyRage
[4:56:54] ebone45: my alt is a DH and their bis Legs drop off last 3 bosses in Nathria, it's impossible to get into a pug as a DH even with a decent ilvl LUL
[4:57:03] Scarhearth: the casuals that arent gearing very well are the ones that login once a week and do a single dungeon and go on the forums and complain how they cant gear
[4:57:11] xideontv: warrior : summon please
[4:57:20] JuicybyNature: im 208 and im doing 14 till week 2 ,,, if u dont raid u dont get gear :/
[4:57:23] Xilice: @Czyszn you can fail mechanics and easily kill the bosses so no not really ^^
[4:57:28] bootybuttss: If they wanna keep loot like this, they need to add a currency and a gear vendor to offset bad luck lol
[4:57:38] crich85: Sup @towelliee heard luxthos joins the raid team. Good luck
[4:57:41] Czyszn: ok good
[4:58:15] Xilice: @RonBurgund your badluck protection is the vault :P much more control of what you get now than before
[4:58:16] xideontv: what ilevel?
[4:58:26] applemethis: damn that dk was pumping dps
[4:58:39] vonviktor_: Not true
[4:58:43] duhworks: not true
[4:58:48] Roffasauras: imagine if gearing was still similar to clsasic
[4:58:52] Czyszn: agreed
[4:58:56] testecklies: tnx you
[4:58:57] Vorog1: What ilvl would you say is good for normal CN?
[4:58:57] Frank4LuLz: what is with the loot, i need like 10 pieces per day, need the purps
[4:58:58] Dyriks: I play a Brewmaster ilvl 197 and I buy my gear which I KNOW is bad LUL
[4:59:01] vonviktor_: I play daily, pugs are hell so there for getting gear is hard.

[4:59:11] Novirtue_: I don't know I've been doing a lot of M+ and nathria and I've got maybe 3-4 drops
[4:59:13] duhworks: i did 5 to 6 dungeons a week and raid time 202
[4:59:14] KonradGM: the biggest issue are the people who are good but not amazing that are stuck not beign able to find people to paly with now
[4:59:16] xiamrs: i play casually.. and im more than fine with current gearing..:>
[4:59:17] Czyszn: i got fresh 60 war and in 2 days got to 170ilevel
[4:59:19] Czyszn: now what?
[4:59:22] pereadin: @Vorog1 184
[4:59:24] Dyriks: But I am too anxious to do m+/raids
[4:59:28] pereadin: good morning btw!
[4:59:29] Innex: @Towelliee Nothing I wish more than being able to play hardcore and mythic, but a lot of us are older now with kids.. Makes it impossible :(
[4:59:33] Vorog1: Nice I am 185
[4:59:33] Scarhearth: with what i said what i mean about that is the ones that play for an hour a WEEK
[4:59:45] Innex: I can only get my rounds in when everyone is asleep
[4:59:51] SwimGoodXO: @Dyriks same, 1 or 2 in a day is too much for me and i used to love doing it
[4:59:52] HotHotHeals: unless you rbg to 1800
[4:59:55] raldrik: I would say there are more of us than ever. We started wow back in the day. Play off and on over the years. Try out a new expansion but have a spouse and maybe kids to balance also. Want to play something that isnt a FPS and cannot commit to a schedule for a game.
[4:59:57] HotHotHeals: then get a 20 ilvl increase
[5:00:01] Realjaywalker: just hit 202 monkaS
[5:00:15] duhworks: I raid and run keys I'm 202 Item level

[5:00:16] KonradGM: i'm like 207 overall, legit if i got to 1.8k rating i wthink i would be 213 overall if not more
[5:00:19] applemethis: i'm 215 ilvl. had to pug H sire for 3 weeks before my guild could down it
[5:00:23] Frank4LuLz: the pain
[5:00:24] Xilice: 235 leggo also bumps you up a bit :P
[5:00:24] jeneraljelly: I'm 205 pugging like 4-5 /10 heroic CN every week only upgrades are the weekly vault basically
[5:00:24] Vindmolle: @Towelliee is that a new Blizz launcher? mine doesnt look like that
[5:00:26] beejayWL: @Towelliee how did you get your bnet launcher to look like that?
[5:00:27] Czyszn: the way ffxiv does it is, if the hardeest content drops ilevel 100 the casual drops ilevel 90
[5:00:27] zaraine1: 207 i think max i can hit next is from vault
[5:00:28] Dyriks: I tried to to a Mythic+5 but the healer got aggro and left

[5:00:37] Deltros123: thats where im at lol
[5:00:37] thiccsushi: @Dyriks Normal/heroic raiding is super easy plus what makes raiding fun is doing it with friends
[5:00:51] Gou99: !ui

[5:00:53] Roughneck124: I’m a casual player stuck at 192 item level. And I don’t get invited to mythic keys.
[5:00:57] Traumfuchs: hi i have to twink a tank for my M+grp. But the Tank will just run M+. What do you think is the best tank for Pushing just with M+ gear and no raiding gear?
[5:01:16] szeeman62: szeeman62 subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 27 months! 
[5:01:22] thiccsushi: You will need to raid some or pvp some on that tank M+ loot drops is shit
[5:01:30] Xilice: @Roughneck124 make your own groups ^^ cant be denied into your own keys ^^
[5:01:33] Scarhearth: @Roughneck124 my advice is to form your own keys
[5:01:50] Scarhearth: @Traumfuchs vengeance DH or brew monk imo
[5:01:54] Kinghorn: towIgnit
[5:01:57] kislikss: @Towelliee buy gold :D buy busst:D
[5:02:09] applemethis: LFG is so brutal
[5:02:09] Czyszn: so i dont know about M+ can you do M+ 5 and get good gear ?
[5:02:12] pereadin: I agree 100%
[5:02:14] Woodnhead: especially for non meta classes
[5:02:15] mmrghost7: does the beast opens for u na playes today ?
[5:02:16] zaraine1: creating a group as a dps , yeah good luck with that
[5:02:19] merevin: 1k io for +10
[5:02:23] Vorog1: The hardest thing for me is finding a guild that I can run things with. Thinking about server transferring
[5:02:31] thiccsushi: I hope we can equip 2 legendaries and have tier sets next patch towLewd
[5:02:45] Yoitsnova: can only blame blizz
[5:02:50] JuicybyNature: it is ... even with a 1k rio score mutliple 14 done in time i dont find grps for 14:D
[5:02:51] Vindmolle: yeah thats not a prob
[5:02:53] drunch85: try playing Fury Warrior towOof
[5:02:53] Scarhearth: I almost miss the BFA melee meta lol
[5:02:56] SeckSymbols: Raider.io is cancer
[5:02:59] janithila: and there is not enought tank for all the group
[5:03:02] SeckSymbols: Should not be celebrated
[5:03:03] wazon_7: @Towelliee i've done 7/8 +15s already as ENH in pugs, so anything really is possible if you know ur shit
[5:03:06] chrispape: this casual player doesnt really enjoy pvp and the gear wall I hit has caused me to level 5 different 60's to have things to do Kappa
[5:03:16] PvtHudson093: and its all coming home to roost
[5:03:24] deedeemegadoodooo: people can ask for whatever they want to
[5:03:26] pilhass10: @Secksymbols well it just shows if you're a good player or not
[5:03:31] applemethis: Rip the frost dk dream
[5:03:32] VipMalis: welfare covenant campaing armor is ivl 190 atm, takes some anima farming but is avail to everyone as solo content, 9 pice set. And next week it will get another ilvl bump
[5:03:33] deedeemegadoodooo: their group their choice
[5:03:38] Xilice: Honestly if you pug a dps for a +10 and you got 1 with 500 rio and 1 with 1k rio who do you pick? now look at the 80+ dps who sign up for any key over 10 that you put up xD its so extreme so many DPS are playing atm
[5:03:39] SeckSymbols: @pilhass10 except it doesn't? Especially in a world of carries
[5:03:46] Innex: Yup I had to change from frost to unholy just to get invites
[5:03:47] Vorog1: Makes sense
[5:03:51] mmrghost7: the problem is then no one will join him
[5:03:54] fistofnature: lf tank +2 Mist requirement: 2 years documented tanking experience (wod not valid) 1500 IO rating and not a warrior
[5:03:59] swordwindgaming: Too many baddies clogging up the raid queue. I admit that IO score is the best insurance against baddies.
[5:04:08] mab_music_ttrpg: what do you think dosent work for prot pal
[5:04:30] PeterPanSmackMan: honestly though how else are people going to see if you have any idea of what you are doing
[5:04:43] applemethis: 13 = 223 yeh 14/15 = 226
[5:05:07] Hoodie187: And thats my problem with the game atm...being forced to play a spec or class thats meta...its fucking wack lol
[5:05:14] Mallaes: So it's a vicious cycle
[5:05:15] Czyszn: WAIT WOW HAS A RATING WEBSITE ON PEOPLE?
[5:05:19] mmrghost7: 12 is 223 aswell
[5:05:22] swordwindgaming: My plan is to slowly build up my IO score by running 8s, then 9s, then finally getting admitted to 10s.
[5:05:22] Czyszn: that is toxiccccccc
[5:05:24] Exeleronz: this is why i dont pve to be honest
[5:05:25] thiccsushi: Your rio is your resume
[5:05:25] ExtreemeCheese: Nobody wants a feral druid. its brutal
[5:05:33] LtDanAndHisMagicLegs: On the flip side, people may join that 12 regardless because it's not their key. If it depletes, no loss to them.
[5:05:36] kappaday23: Keepo
[5:05:44] Dyriks: my dad is soon 58 years old, and we have been queuing up for pretty much everything since TBC. We hate raider.io, but we understand why it was made.
[5:05:45] xluckydawgx: @ExtreemeCheese Isnt feral doing insane damage?
[5:05:45] pereadin: Just revert M+ changes smileW
[5:05:48] Arocian: I go out a couple times a week and donate time to find casuals and group up with them to help them complete higher level content.
[5:05:57] Frank4LuLz: LFR Battle pets Edition
[5:05:58] Wildside1177: The "People down here" will be 75% of the player base. They will leave.
[5:05:59] Xilice: Thats how it works with rio though xD you dont just go from a 2 to a 15 xD anyone you see with high rio started by doing lower keys to get it up - you gotta get grinding to get up to high keys not just luck into 15s like last season
[5:06:01] mmrghost7: I MISS tf
[5:06:04] swordwindgaming: People will join that key with the dumb IO because everyone (dps) is desperate for a spot.
[5:06:04] StoicTaurus: middle is PvP
[5:06:06] jason_shade: a strong middle class keeps the game thriving
[5:06:07] pilhass10: just get good LUL
[5:06:09] ExtreemeCheese: @xluckydawgx it does good damage, but its no boomy. people want a boomy
[5:06:09] Vorog1: I am the bottom of the bottom
[5:06:09] Moobot: towGreen Shadowlands Limited Edition TOWELLIEE covenant shirts AND Towelliee hats are LIVE! check them out HERE! | Dbh.la/towelliee towBlue
[5:06:13] pereadin: Even then, M+ gear dropped mythic quality raid loot
[5:06:13] PeterPanSmackMan: I luckily have friends that play but if we look for 1 random, we for sure check but obv it doesnt always work out
[5:06:14] Czyszn: your so right
[5:06:21] swordwindgaming: I have to queue for hours to get admitted to a +10 out of pity.
[5:06:21] mmrghost7: that sweet sound when u got TF 985 :D
[5:06:23] pereadin: Tthe issue with that was the titanforging
[5:06:27] ebone45: middle is not pbp LUL
[5:06:28] JuicybyNature: u made a really good point there
[5:06:32] ebone45: pvp*
[5:06:32] Scoodles91: get them plebs some bonus rolls and let it be over
[5:06:33] Czyszn: your either 235+ or your not lmao everything from 170 to 210 doesnt matter
[5:07:07] StoicTaurus: Ages long question answered: PvP is easier than PvE :D
[5:07:14] Dyriks: I hate mythic+ because I can't just hit a button and queue for it, same with rated bgs. I am anti social and I just hate it LUL
[5:07:15] Chimp458: pvp is the only viable gearing option ultimately atm if your not in a mythic raiding guild
[5:07:21] westgamez: like WoD
[5:07:24] Sarbanes93: Give us the token upgrade system back
[5:07:29] zaraine1: MEANINGFULL CHOICE
[5:07:29] mmrghost7: let the loot be loot is gonna fail i guarantee ppl will rage quit
[5:07:30] rustymuch21: !points
[5:07:32] westgamez: purely research filler
[5:07:33] Its_Me_MG: absolutely agree
[5:07:34] Chimp458: Maybe they are trying to bring back "guilds" and "community"
[5:07:38] Frank4LuLz: @Towelliee no more participation awards
[5:07:44] Xilice: @StoicTaurus just not a thing xD two completely different beasts and most mythic raiders i know can pvp for shit xD
[5:07:44] Vorog1: Make necrolords good lol
[5:07:44] metavahn231: on the up side normal and heroic have alot of participation heh
[5:07:54] Wildside1177: That is the loop I am in. I do not have M+ experience so I cannot get into any keys. And I am pretty close to saying fuck it and cancelling my sub. There are other games.
[5:07:57] Kinghorn: thinking those people will still be around in june LUL
[5:08:00] smashwow: they made too many changes to gearing. 1 or 2 changes would have been fine
[5:08:06] Roffasauras: always need the carrot on a stick
[5:08:10] raldrik: participation = subs

[5:08:35] Gorestack: I mean, that's completely wrong @Frank4LuLz rewards are pure rng right now you can clear full mythic raid and get nothing
[5:08:39] Czyszn: yea look at this expansion many mechanics to make your lose time. in the maw you die in a bad spot you lost stygia. in torghast you die in a high floor you get no loot. its like bro its WoW not dark souls
[5:08:41] Watchwhileiplay: does twisting cooridoor go away tuesday?
[5:08:42] Syllvn: Gear to work towards in PVE would be fine.
[5:08:42] beejayWL: thank you @Towelliee
[5:08:42] PVPworld: nope neva!
[5:08:45] CazualD: @wildside1177 Alot of people feeling exactly the same

[5:08:53] ukladd: I waited 4 months for a single drop way back in Wrath guess it depends how bad you want it
[5:08:53] vonviktor_: Towelliee with the truth
[5:08:55] bicchiaki: god thank you for tellin em

[5:09:17] ArchAngel_83: Hey chat :) been looking for addon for my cursor ,because i constantly lose track of it ,appreciate it if someone knows something like highlights where my mouse at .
[5:09:17] Taylormade2711: i think a valor point system would be perfect. honestly running a night of mythic plus and getting no gear after running raid and getting no gear feels bad
[5:09:21] Chimp458: I think you also have to look at what sub group is bigger this isn't a pay to play game where they elitist and whales pay the bills
[5:09:27] Beer_Goblin: mr benjamin is lonely
[5:09:34] Twigz_KC: Is Wayne Brady gonna have to choke a bitch?
[5:09:36] Watchwhileiplay: do twisting cooridoor go away on tuesday??
[5:09:36] necralia: LUL
[5:09:40] Nuggsz: Is Wayne Brady gonna have to choke a bitch? lol
[5:09:42] Arocian: activision is the auditor
[5:09:45] Its_Me_MG: KEKW so goddamn true
[5:09:50] swordwindgaming: @Towelliee the truth is that as a dude with no connections or raid spots, you're just stuck doing the same BG/arena/daily grind that have been happening every xpac. That is what will get people unsubbed, because its just the same old thing again.
[5:10:00] assman_ny: Not in Terry Tates house haha
[5:10:04] Medobolt: they will buff loot next patch KEKW @Towelliee
[5:10:08] Hoodie187: @watchwhileiplay no...its there forever

[5:10:45] Antdavs24: its ok we have AoC in 10 years Kappa
[5:10:47] Medobolt: 2 items per m+ is never a good idea
[5:10:51] tezrelli: store anima on june
[5:10:56] fooxytv: will Ion step down if he has to delivery something like that again?
[5:10:58] Xilice: @pereadin people been screaming at blizz to remove the pvp scaling and when its finally gone we want it back ?! xD
[5:10:59] Wulfgrym: TD ahh yeah
[5:11:08] KingSlayerYotam: wow doesn't need to have the TBC mentality again
[5:11:10] leshiltv: They that bfa extreme and it’s just as bad for the game. They need to find a happy medium
[5:11:13] ihaveaglitch: I've been mad during the two covenant quests that sent me back to Zandalar, I don't want to go back there.
[5:11:14] Syllvn: The literally showed us 'You think you want it, but you don't' when everyone cried about all the loot issues xD Now there is 0 extra systems
[5:11:29] Todmeister9000: Call To Arms addon
[5:11:33] mmrghost7: yeah this time they have big threat coming up , riot is not messing around plus i'm sure riot will make it free to play
[5:11:35] Chimp458: lets just hope they dont get rid of tier catch up .. worst thing in BC was bieng in a guild raid stuck at t5 because your best players got gear and got in better guilds
[5:11:40] Thoreya: hes the face tho
[5:11:42] Frank4LuLz: ION is a Puppet
[5:12:06] Antdavs24: he's in charge of the game no more no less the totem poll is much higher than just him
[5:12:14] Moobot: Ask a moderator for permission before posting a link, @applemethis (warning)
[5:12:14] xALcaPWNedx: bills vs browns AFC championship lol. calling it
[5:12:18] Medobolt: @ihaveaglitch but bwonsamdi is cool PepeClap
[5:12:25] RavenARPG: he delivered the most best selling expansion in the history of the game, in blizzard-activision eyes Ian is the GOAT.
[5:12:25] zaraine1: hope theres not pay to win
[5:12:25] Lonely_piggy_: "Free to Play" but extremely Pay to Win for sure

[5:12:40] jure__: you can watch an amazing documentary about God of War development on youtube and it follows the game director a lot, if you want to know what game director does
[5:12:41] ihaveaglitch: Tencent made the Monster Hunter movie, which surprisingly wasn't terrible.
[5:12:49] Czyszn: riot is no joke they put alot of time and effort on all their products
[5:12:50] snoo_32: albion online is free to play and has tons of players. Don't know how they make their money though
[5:12:55] pereadin: @Xilice I'm not asking for PvP gear to be downscaled. I"m asking for PvE M+ gear to be brought up to standards
[5:12:55] BlockishTiger: is the conversation rn around gear drop rates / gear in general?
[5:12:57] fooxytv: @Towelliee have you seen the Mythic Quest tv show.. haha definitely represents WoW
[5:12:57] Czyszn: and they coming for blizz with MMO and ARPG
[5:12:57] wastedx3149: cleveland smacked Pittsburgh arpund kekw
[5:13:02] FischBowlGaming: You not enjoying the expac @Towelliee?
[5:13:02] BrewCityMonk: FF14 LUL
[5:13:03] leshiltv: Catering to activation is part of the problem. They need to get modern like Riot.
[5:13:05] I_DoctorSatan_I: Hey Blizzard stock holders...you want money to keep rolling in? Players to keep their subs? Then tell ion and his goons to inc loot system in SL 4Head 4Head
[5:13:06] CDT_tv: ffxiv is close
[5:13:09] Novirtue_: I have casual guildies hating shadowlands because they can't get enough gear FeelsBadMan just give them a few more items
[5:13:19] Velashen: Just the beginning of this expansion. Things will change over patches. Eh

[5:13:44] piratechris: To be fair it's not the same team at Blizzard doing Shadowlands as did Draenor so ...
[5:13:44] Mattven: june

[5:14:09] Wildside1177: I will be long gone by June
[5:14:09] Dyriks: haha, my dog does the same when I just say "dingdong".
[5:14:19] ihaveaglitch: Up until 2 days ago I still had 4 blues, finally had to spend the Anima to upgrade covenant gear because the loot system is horrible.
[5:14:20] Chimp458: hopefully this is typical bliz over twisting the knob per usual. 9.1 shows up and you think its destiny loot shooter :)
[5:14:20] HotHotHeals: I got a 197 hynmal trinket from the covenent daily. THE LOOT
[5:14:23] 無職提督: thats gonna be deadly
[5:14:25] BrewCityMonk: Hell, Toragast is just a ripoff of Infinite Dudgeons from FF14 LUL
[5:14:35] LockonZero: @novirtue_ well it does not make sense to push yourself to try and time keys and get better at the game and in the end you get 35 anima, this system sucks
[5:14:36] CDT_tv: true
[5:14:39] pereadin: Nah BC isn't strong enough to do that
[5:14:40] Frank4LuLz: true
[5:14:40] kappaday23: 4Head
[5:14:42] CDT_tv: arena aswell
[5:14:44] Templexx: wait....subs are dropping?
[5:14:47] LockonZero: and I say proudly that I am a casual xD
[5:14:50] denflup: what, shadowlands dead already¡
[5:14:53] fooxytv: I haven't been playing SL's much but is it really that bad?
[5:14:53] denflup: ?
[5:14:54] PvtHudson093: The Loot Must Flow!!!!
[5:14:58] Vorog1: Yeah TBC is the shit! I cant wait
[5:14:58] Novirtue_: @LockonZero yeah the 35 anima huts
[5:15:00] Twigz_KC: I can't wait for TBC!
[5:15:01] Vigi9413: even with the lack of loot I've enjoyed shadowlands a lot more than the beginning of bfa
[5:15:01] necralia: 4 sure
[5:15:02] CDT_tv: yeah me too
[5:15:02] Vindmolle: TBC is going to be extremely popular when it hits

[5:15:13] PrimalRain: pereadin BC has more staying power than classic
[5:15:14] Hoodie187: it 100% will have more subs than classic
[5:15:19] Arocian: BC numbers will spike for awhile
[5:15:21] Marah57: +
[5:15:21] DashCityGG: fair statement
[5:15:21] Thoreya: i started my wow careeer back in BC

[5:15:24] Novirtue_: @LockonZero ugh autocorrect... lol
[5:15:24] Thoreya: 2007 a young pleb
[5:15:24] Wildside1177: @Fooxytv It is very good except for gearing. If you do not like the M+ treadmill it is shitty.
[5:15:26] 無職提督: hope they got illidan & sargeras on speed-dila for that
[5:15:26] assman_ny: BC was a hoot, still like going back
[5:15:28] applemethis: Bruh. BC was good. its gonna get the subs retail player here started playing in 2005
[5:15:29] ihaveaglitch: That's because the game took off after the South Park episode
[5:15:30] pereadin: It will but most people came back for Wrath @Towelliee there's not much holding potential outtside of Shatt dailies
[5:15:31] ExtreemeCheese: I started in WotLK so i'm excited to play BC
[5:15:31] GenMysters: @Towelliee So this is cool.. Just installed Twitch App on Amazon Echo Show. Watching on Echo show is kind of great since I can watch and still play at the same time.
[5:15:32] westgamez: BC is gunna be lit AF

[5:15:46] I_DoctorSatan_I: i refuse to play "Classic" when i already played "Classic" back in the day LUL LUL But you kids have fun with ur 2021 BC "Classic" LUL
[5:15:47] Velashen: BC will be big for a few months just like classic.
[5:15:48] jeneraljelly: I think people that dont already have 60's though are going to have a bad time trying to start BC fresh
[5:15:49] piratechris: I've been playing since Beta, but not many like me around and you won't keep subs by catering to me and mine :)
[5:15:51] CDT_tv: ulduar was amazing
[5:15:56] Vigi9413: @Towelliee rank the expansions in your opinion?

[5:16:23] StoicTaurus: classic sub rises, tbc sub rises even more, wotlk .. subs flat lined and just went down since then
[5:16:24] Dyriks: Dyriks subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 83 months! Eventhough I don't watch you as much as I did, you are still my favourite streamer <3
[5:16:25] fooxytv: @Fooxytv Ah okay, was it pretty much the same in BfA? but I understand the frustration
[5:16:27] Elenagjika: cant wait for WOD classic

[5:16:55] storm99413: gated from rep farm
[5:16:58] Arocian: hahah yeah world buffs disappeared

[5:17:34] PrimalRain: it'll happen I'm sure
[5:17:37] Clay2K_: @Towelliee what is that blue swirly stuff that keeps dropping under your char?
[5:17:43] Paladine_Dragonslayer: Going to have to do the Sun Eater grind again
[5:17:43] Novirtue_: The heroic dungeons in BC, the first time hurt.... oof
[5:17:43] Vindmolle: Molten core you could go in at lvl 54 and in blues
[5:17:54] westgamez: Is there a date for BC?
[5:18:02] Wildside1177: Greatest chart ever
[5:18:04] I_DoctorSatan_I: "Oh, you have 1 blue item in your gear?"....(click) declined towQueen towQueen
[5:18:07] Roffasauras: think you needed honored rep for heroics and flying for the netherstorm dungeons
[5:18:16] CDT_tv: well arena will be gated to seasons and well see
[5:18:17] wastedx3149: heroics took revered rep for keys iirc
[5:18:24] LtDanAndHisMagicLegs: @Towelliee Couldn't even enter Shattered Halls at all, w/o attunement
[5:18:25] dokor: you had to farm reputation to unlock heroic, fun times !
[5:18:31] ayrennasky: and classes were like required for specific bosses for their spells and abilities
[5:18:32] thebakeriscomingforu: People are going to lose their minds over TBC attunements.
[5:18:36] TiredCarcass: BC fav expac but not going back

[5:19:02] pereadin: It still won't be the same without a farmable content like M+
[5:19:04] LtDanAndHisMagicLegs: Need flying to do the Tempest Keep dungeons
[5:19:05] nazzari01: Heroic Shattered Halls was so tough!
[5:19:10] Arocian: and the original level race
[5:19:13] CDT_tv: then you had shockadin shadowpriest
[5:19:19] ebone45: macr stun lock rogue with AR in arena 31/30 XD
[5:19:22] Chimp458: mage tanks for gruuls
[5:19:25] thebakeriscomingforu: Attunement was equal parts rep grinds and quest lines
[5:19:28] Kinghorn: https://external-preview.redd.it/J1KICoSjw-XD4V1tQJ-F2cI_ttuzrWUW43evogVOt5U.jpg?auto=webp&s=e4e464ee45bf94c16244a4ed2c0139523067a81d @Towelliee the attunement chart
[5:19:48] Paladine_Dragonslayer: buy those heroic keys
[5:19:48] swordwindgaming: TBC heroics required two CC classes.
[5:19:54] swordwindgaming: I'm sure that will get nerfed.

[5:24:11] thebakeriscomingforu: X new classic servers, keep Y classic servers the same, move Z classic servers to TBC classic, then have fresh tbc servers. Would be my guess

[6:50:12] CritcobainTV: Unless you're doing Rent to own, you pay full price for the house
[6:50:15] GrimExecutable: well I mean rent to own is a thing
[6:50:15] Stickly: "rent to own" sorya
[6:50:18] chrslp: Unless you do a lease to own, Rent doesnt matter at all for purchasing a house
[6:50:42] Velashen: Rent to own is always a rip off
[6:50:49] chrslp: Yep LUL
[6:50:56] Masqerader: just means no one has left yet
[6:50:56] JBUCKS93: It also depends on the lender for which docs are required. Certain lenders require more cause of their risk tolerance, it’s called overlays. Private lenders like quicken and loan depot do not have overlays.
[6:51:03] chrslp: Lease to own is on par with places like rent-a-center
[6:51:18] Todmeister9000: the addon works for me towHype
[6:51:43] mo197: hip hip night fae
[6:51:46] Innex: Rent to own's are kind of a scam from most shady landlords.. They'll put a clause in the contract that if you're a day late on a payment, you could forfeit your rights
[6:51:54] Ertra: why are you doing heroics?
[6:51:59] Masqerader: augment runes
[6:52:02] Ertra: ahh
[6:52:03] chrslp: Imagine paying a car lease and 5-10% goes toward buying the car.
[6:52:05] GoGetItKo: then guessing games during fairy boss and noone knows either
[6:52:33] yeti82: lol
[6:52:43] Swiftie0: wait there is a WA for tirna?!?! I had no idea

[6:53:16] DeanoTV: just done night fae new story so good :D
[6:53:41] CritcobainTV: There's an addon that you check each one and then it has a pop up window, you click the icon on the window and it just tells you which one to go through
[6:53:58] Cristiex2012: Isn't that illegal?
[6:54:03] Plague_GG: Show me your World First. Oh wait...that was Limit... @rydos84 LUL

[6:55:05] Xockel: LUL
[6:55:24] mo197: Inconceivable
[6:55:28] Todmeister9000: impothible

[6:56:56] tarot_with_tricia: THis healer leading by example!
[6:57:19] snoo_32: healers and dps are usually the responsible ones, you rarely see a responsibile dps :) gotta carry
[6:57:40] pereadin: by having tthe ranged go to tthe pillars to help me while they dps
[6:57:50] herpderpdoublederp: you have to be so careful when the tank positions spear flurry on the logs
[6:57:55] herpderpdoublederp: as healers trying to do it
[6:58:00] Alienfromger: pala need that nerf towHAMUP
[6:58:07] Plague_GG: R1 mazer
[6:58:32] Brett_07: As a tank do all your damage abilities generate high threat?
[6:58:46] snoo_32: the guy who only does normals and heroics says paladins are broken in PvE towLul towKawaii
[6:58:47] tarot_with_tricia: This healer has mastered the art of the puzzles

[7:01:17] chrslp: squishier
[7:01:53] Kelloggs9: What level key is this?
[7:02:12] Suzaku1011: heroic no key
[7:02:12] Affiiance: Keeping up with alts is insane this expansion
[7:02:31] Finarato: The ilvl is what upsets me
[7:02:33] Thunderpint: We want good ilvl loot!!!
[7:02:42] Shrenko: I dont give a shit either
[7:02:47] Czyszn: wait really?
[7:02:53] Mallaes: It's not bad
[7:02:56] swordwindgaming: you don't because you don't have to give an f about your IO score lol
[7:03:00] Shrenko: there is no reason to time a key other than upgrading the key
[7:03:02] Suzaku1011: weekly cache feels more rewarding unless you are running extremely high keys
[7:03:04] PeterPanSmackMan: I wish m+ end chest loot was better
[7:03:06] Czyszn: if you finish on time you get lott?
[7:03:07] Shrenko: and 1 more piece of loot
[7:03:12] Czyszn: loot? but its ass?
[7:03:14] Onixblack: @Towelliee 100% no point in pushing a key max loot reward. I give 0 fucks if i key it. As long as i finish it
[7:03:22] mo197: feed that vault
[7:03:25] Onixblack: loot system is jacked anyways
[7:03:31] Raffah_: yeah the idea that you dont have to time the key to get loot from vault is awesome
[7:03:55] Auru: and the ilvl is lower too
[7:03:56] TheWizardGeorge: you mean getting anima if you fail lol
[7:04:10] taffell: why did you change your monk to Tauren?
[7:04:11] Mezukage: less loot = longer longevity of the game. sad but true in a way
[7:04:40] Balzofsteels: they nerfed the gold reward out of those ?
[7:04:55] Motaaa96: has prot pally always been your goto tank?
[7:05:00] CritcobainTV: i want to push my io and time all my 15s for KSM, but idk
[7:05:06] CritcobainTV: rough in a pug
[7:05:12] NewfyDog: Is that the best way to get the gear? Just do mythic+???
[7:05:18] smokingcactus: @Mezukage but also makes people not really want to play. but same thing goes for raid have done total of like 35 bosses together and 2 pieces of loot is turning me off
[7:05:18] Sincline387: No TF/WF to keep people grinding so we get less loot to keep people grinding
[7:05:19] Todmeister9000: it works for me
[7:05:32] Todmeister9000: maybe set it to refresh checking every 2 seconds or so?
[7:05:34] Onixblack: @Towelliee I still wish xpacs were more alt friendly. Like I shouldnt have to do campaigns everytime or get torghast up to max layer on everything fucking character
[7:05:38] Wildside1177: KSM?
[7:05:51] Ruinkey: How hard would it be for someone to start a fresh character and go through all game content now days.
[7:05:54] Mezukage: @smokingcactus true.
[7:05:56] mo197: hahaha mount luck
[7:05:56] Vindmolle: @Wildside1177 Keystone Master
[7:06:03] slyvax: What's your raid prog looking like man?
[7:06:11] Onixblack: @Ruinkey one character? not that hard to maintain
[7:06:12] Finarato: I also feel like the lader from 10 to 15 is busted. You only get 203 gear for finishing 10-13 but you need like 211 gear to do 14+
[7:06:14] slyvax: KSM? more like KMS doing that lol
[7:06:43] xluckydawgx: lol the guild best is 19 wtf
[7:06:58] TheWizardGeorge: I'm having a hard time staying motivated with more than 1 toon this xpac

[7:07:29] swordwindgaming: @Wowkin There isn't really a point to doing more than 1 toon in SL unless you want to milk Garrison gold missions
[7:07:53] Swiftie0: ya demon hunter tanks are so insane right now haha
[7:07:58] KnsWoW: https://wago.io/4yXWavdsW
[7:07:58] TheWizardGeorge: I just like having variety
[7:08:10] xluckydawgx: @swordwindgaming Theres 4 different storyline at endgame lol
[7:08:14] MrGattz: https://wago.io/4yXWavdsW
[7:08:43] swordwindgaming: @xluckydawgx You can switch covenants if you just want to play for the storylines.
[7:09:04] xluckydawgx: Or just have different characters?
