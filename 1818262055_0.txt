[6:57:53] plasmacastersalesman: do it after that q
[6:58:18] Markfooz: why is the queue so long is there not a lot of soloqueue players?
[6:58:55] k1m1Live: All of my solo shuffle queues today were over 35 minutes. The average is a complete lie!
[6:58:57] Pallyofhell: @Markfooz lack of healers
[6:59:46] gwynbleidd1b: Swifty hi man what's jappened with the hardcore haven't been here a while :D
[6:59:52] ZFPuhiOwns: because it will get abused
[6:59:54] Markfooz: lol thats a dangerous road
[7:00:09] Pallyofhell: we would just focus the AI healer
[7:00:19] plasmacastersalesman: just make it dd only
[7:00:27] SoSorryForChu: Or, better solution, people get over needing to see big yellow numbers and realize the value of big green ones... >.>
[7:00:28] Kubosllav: Hi all
[7:00:29] CEOoftheVoid: Or they could just bring back 3 dps solo shuffle teams
[7:00:38] Pallyofhell: or remove the requirement to have a healer in solo shuffle
[7:00:52] mrxilio: get the Obsidian Legend title?
[7:00:59] Glypso_: Should make healer a little easier to play
[7:01:01] Djinx_o: Even a broken clock is right 2 times a day :D
[7:01:05] ZFPuhiOwns: @Pallyofhell ye and you get 2 healers on the other team nice LUL

[7:01:48] Pallyofhell: @ZFPuhiOwns still have the system limit the amount of healers on a team
[7:01:51] Markfooz: if they get rid of healers might as well just have u hit target dummies most dmg wins
[7:01:54] mrxilio: @DLCKDANN69 can just farm honor gear.. matters yeah but pvp gear scales
