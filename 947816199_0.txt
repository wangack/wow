[0:53:28] Shurn_82: You think you do....
[0:53:37] Wildside1177: A lot of people had rose coloured glasses. Classic was good for its time. It is not actually "giood" by today's standards.

[0:59:52] Wildside1177: The music in classic is 10/10 at all times.
[1:00:22] shocky_324: you should get mara carries at your level
[1:00:30] CritcobainTV: @Towelliee you usually do it from like 20-40, but you could push it a bit longer, and its not really amazing xp til 30. 20-24 is probably better in SFK
[1:01:31] neverbornlucky: wc is worse

[1:18:28] efcon: @Shrenko Obviously nothing to do with vaxxine.
[1:18:31] Shrenko: AstraZeneca
[1:18:35] Kinghorn: the necklace quest for horde you need to go to org like 3 times
[1:18:44] Shrenko: @efcon why do you say that?
[1:19:03] neyo_9: who
[1:19:05] Kinghorn: it is before the first boss
[1:19:09] efcon: because experts say they feel its totaly safe
[1:19:25] Kinghorn: the first boss the trogg
[1:19:35] belfastcl: @Shrenko because the number of people vaccinated is so high that is almost impossible claim it was caused by the vaccine, even if both events are close in time
[1:20:26] Shrenko: @efcon yes it is an exremely low chance but it can still happen? more and more people are getting clots most likely from it
[1:20:53] Nico_vdM: At least making progress on shrooms

[1:21:21] Nico_vdM: He has prowl
[1:21:33] Shurn_82: @Shrenko well the interesting thing about clots, with everyone being stiuck home and not doing the normal moving around a lot, sitting can cause clots too ...which i doubt is what caused these peoples

[1:21:42] StaticBD: 3 ppl getting clots out of 100's of millions of doses administered? sounds like a non story to me
[1:21:51] WhiteKnight74648: You could probably make an over dramatic reality show about these mushrooms and your adventures getting them
[1:21:53] ForTheSchmitt: Is that G-Fuel ranking thing still going on?
[1:21:55] RaidbossTV: Blizz will make bank with the boosts
[1:22:00] rocthenite: still no changes!
[1:22:08] belfastcl: @Shrenko the alleged probability of getting a clot from the vaccine is lower than the prob of getting a clot in normal circumstances
[1:22:10] TombStoneMercenary: but is that not the point of classic that is was harder and took time?
[1:22:15] SteveSD: boosts are ass, makes for a bunch of noobs at high level
[1:22:19] Shurn_82: or pay the host of the server to get levels
[1:22:19] TweakT: how do u get boosted in a fresh? sstvThinking
[1:22:37] Shurn_82: @TweakT pay the gms to give you levels lol

[1:23:01] northcub: 3 people out of hundreds of millions die of COVID - everyone panic.  3 people out of hundreds of millions die from vaccine - no big deal
[1:23:05] KillaPr0: Just a few walks a week will reduce the chances of a blood clot
[1:23:19] Shurn_82: @killapr0 exactly
[1:23:21] ventu105: morning

[1:23:57] StaticBD: @northcub but millions of ppl died from covid. not just 3
[1:24:11] Mic_e: Idk Steve, many returning players who have families now are gonna buy the boost, they are not nessecary noobs.
[1:24:18] Shurn_82: @Towelliee  yep it will be a body on ground
[1:24:43] KillaPr0: no walking for me stitches on the bottom of my foot, major pain in the ass
[1:24:45] TombStoneMercenary: I do find it funny that people will pay to be boosted but get all burn the heathen if you bring up hey why not let them put LFR or LFG in the classic format.....
[1:24:54] RaidbossTV: @killapr0 ouch!
[1:25:37] Shurn_82: @TombStoneMercenary you could get carried in original release...they just want #nochanges
[1:25:38] JigsawSaint: Like space, in WoW no one can hear you scream.
[1:25:39] ForTheSchmitt: @towelliee is that ranking thing still going on for the G-Fuel sales?
[1:26:08] Snabido: F PepeHands
[1:26:14] ForTheSchmitt: Damn sorry man....
[1:26:19] efcon: @Shrenko Well, here is the story. Is this lie about sideeffect the only lie, or are there more lies?
[1:26:44] WhiteKnight74648: @Towelliee you're a winner in a my book <3
[1:27:18] Gizadragon: yup
[1:27:30] TombStoneMercenary: @Shurn_82 I know just find it funny still that is ok to pay gold and sit at the start of an instance and let a 60 do all the work personally i think its not no changes its they just want to sit and get the xp....

[2:20:45] theDirtyon3: It because of the lack of loot allowing lower end guild to get the kill @Towelliee
[2:20:46] CritcobainTV: Of course. Classic wow is clearly the much more difficult version of the game. There's NO CHANCE that denathrius is harder than ragnaros
[2:20:48] CritcobainTV: KEKW
[2:21:03] Kinghorn: PogChamp
[2:21:07] Kinghorn: few hundred
[2:21:08] studenalbatroz: TBC SOON POG
[2:21:11] Murlocz: Decent enchant for sure
[2:21:16] Ishva: Like 5% lower health across the raid more likely
[2:21:20] TweakT: classic people dont argue that retail raiders are easier than classic dafuq
[2:21:23] Murlocz: @studenalbatroz Biggest gold farmer in the world here in the chat PogChamp
[2:21:25] TweakT: raids*
[2:21:25] Kinghorn: like 2-300 on azuresong

[2:21:51] Mahal_11532: imagine raiding multiple times per night
[2:21:58] TheCliffyShow: My goal right now is KSM and AotC. If I get that done, then maybe I'll see what I can do in heroic.
[2:22:21] TheCliffyShow: mythic i mwn.
[2:22:28] TheCliffyShow: Mythic I mean.
[2:22:29] Jesperoni: how was stone legion for you guys
[2:22:31] SonofHorus82: damn I thought I was hot sauce when Savory Deviate Delight recipe dropped for me last night. Crusader enchant is baller.

[2:23:01] Murlocz: @Towelliee What do u think its a decent exchange ratio for gold trading between Retail and Classic? I have some gold on retail i would like to trade for Classic gold, maybe 250-300k for 1k in classic?
[2:23:06] Pevertse: Pevertse subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 60 months! 
[2:23:29] CritcobainTV: My old guild had like 180 attempts on heroic Donny KEKW that's why i left @Towelliee
[2:23:32] studenalbatroz: it's 400k per 1k @Murlocz
[2:23:35] Kinghorn: probably closer to 500k Murlocz but hard to say
[2:23:40] Kinghorn: there you go
[2:24:09] TheCliffyShow: I'm 7/10 heroic. Not as fancy as mythic, but I'm happy about it.
[2:24:23] Murlocz: @studenalbatroz Where can i trade it?
[2:24:27] CDubTheRIPper: donny bag of donuts
[2:24:45] MeisterPetze: true
[2:24:47] Ishva: that phase 3 is rough on both heroic and mythic
[2:24:48] studenalbatroz: There are trading discord doing trades like that, they do it for a fee %
[2:24:48] TheGaoSora: Azshara?
[2:24:49] CDubTheRIPper: yeah def one of the harder ones
[2:24:52] Kinghorn: heroic donny is so fun
[2:25:03] mrelgaato: Freya?
[2:25:15] CritcobainTV: Yeah but my guild wasn't even trying to go into mythic even tho the first few were easier. And the dps was really really low. Like, on average our dps were doing like 3k dps in heroic :(
[2:25:16] TheCliffyShow: Impregnator? That sounds like a kinky boss.
[2:25:16] CDubTheRIPper: ghuun was too

[2:25:37] TweakT: EU could pug it EZ
[2:25:38] Weeaboo__Chad: KT heroic?
[2:25:40] TheGaoSora: such a terrible encounter design..
[2:25:42] Kinghorn: I dont remember him being too difficult
[2:25:45] ZIKERZ: yes wat r these names
[2:25:45] CDubTheRIPper: only because people had no idea what to do on LFR
[2:25:50] wisperuna: @Towelliee ghun you needed 2 ppl to know what to do

[2:45:56] Dr_ShockLoL: @Towelliee trueeee lol
[2:46:07] SteveSD: give blizz a inch they take a mile
[2:46:10] xXSiebzehnXx: I don’t think retail is that fucked up. I think they’re just trying to cater to both casuals and hardcores, but their will always be a skew towards one
[2:46:11] crumbler81: LUL probably true Sadge
[2:46:11] wisperuna: @Towelliee note that it was easy to levle to 58 in tbc due to the exp  reduction prior to 60
[2:46:12] rocthenite: it just streamers who want money
[2:46:12] jioxthelock: caring about caring about boost is dumb asf steve
[2:46:13] zyrokor: KEKWlaugh
[2:46:14] TweakT: how can u say nobody cares when somebody do care 🤔
[2:46:15] Sincline387: but but we have a hashtag you have to listen.....said every snowflake ever

[2:46:16] MikeGus: True
[2:46:16] instructOS: vocal minority? demorats?
[2:46:17] Brodih_: Newman the man!
[2:46:18] toobaked1987: Some of us have been playing WoW for 16 years. The game will never be able to capture that part of our life again. Just enjoy it for what it is.
[2:46:19] GrimlicTV: cheering on a terrible precedent for classic. kek
[2:46:20] Weeaboo__Chad: Where did you find that pic?
[2:46:22] Maldinger_der_Edellurker: i have to play the game BabyRage
[2:46:24] Frank4LuLz: so true
[2:46:30] Screamnsteam: More people to gank in hellfire LUL
[2:46:37] Ruzel_: @8_stages but you know boosting was there back in original TBC right
[2:46:38] mavericks312: ill be boosting a destro lock come tbc
[2:46:39] xXSiebzehnXx: @toobaked1987 I feel that
[2:46:45] jokermines: 79% of people don't care... so Blizzard obviously going to go with majority
[2:46:47] Thills_: im currently playing classic and I dont care in fact im gonna buy the boost myself KEKW
[2:46:48] SteveSD: dumb as f
[2:46:48] GrimlicTV: blizzard could start charging you $5 to log in and towelliee would say its a good idea. so ofc he shills for the boosts also LUL

[2:46:55] Moobot: We want YOU for a WoW TBC raiding guild! Apply now! || http://towelliee.com/tbc || We will be choosing Azuresong Horde for our TBC server! Start leveling now! || Not playing Pally, no Blood Elfs yet || No TBC Launch date yet.
[2:46:55] Kinghorn: my brother
[2:46:57] PacioliNB: Its a major minority that actually think about it.  I know no one in my guild gave zero shits
[2:46:59] icerasta: thats me!
[2:47:05] Weeaboo__Chad: Most people in Classic are now for #SomeChanges. most have learned that having #NOchanges has fundementally changed the game
[2:47:05] Gizadragon: hell yea boost for the win
[2:47:06] dawginspace: not me
[2:47:11] SteveSD: or play in the pre patch expansion
[2:47:13] mrelgaato: i will level to 60
[2:47:15] jioxthelock: LUL
[2:47:19] Dr_ShockLoL: @ruzel_ i leveled myself, so no. but idc. i dont wanna level 3 toons again lol so im all for it. classic leveling is horrid, period.
[2:47:20] remedyt: why werent there boosts back in bc?
[2:47:20] wisperuna: @Towelliee so why are we leveling a   dudu ?
[2:47:21] mavericks312: vanilla leveling was trash an overated
[2:47:21] Grublo: 1-60 is okay the first time around...then after that..it can be classified it's own form of torture
[2:47:25] Murlocz: Casuals will stop playing anyway, makes no difference
[2:47:27] TheGaoSora: Gold HYPERS
[2:47:28] jokermines: Then level to 60... it's your choice if you want to boost
[2:47:30] SteveSD: you have plenty of time before tbc comes out to level, boosts are just pay to win crap
[2:47:41] SonofHorus82: I used to be part of the #nochanges crowd before classic came out. Then classic came out and I was all about some changes.
[2:47:41] TheCliffyShow: The moment TBC Classic was announced I was like, "Taking a nap, wake me up when they are talking about retail again".
[2:47:42] FatChase: I'm levelling in classic right now cause I'm a bit burnt out on Retail and classic levelling is quite chill
[2:47:48] Dr_ShockLoL: @Grublo true lol. its torture and boring
[2:47:49] Thills_: and the boost is only a one time thing
[2:47:50] jioxthelock: exaclty!
[2:47:55] MuttonChopins: imma use that 58 boost on a warrior
[2:47:59] Ahlstr0m_: Ive played classic since launch day. I am ECSTATIC about the boost
[2:48:01] MysticalOS: The main concern I seen with 58 boosts, are botting. Blizz needs to really crack down on that problem
[2:48:05] Shidopie: You can always farm out the R14 gear
[2:48:07] PacioliNB: Hell that 58 boost will be for my farming druid! :D
[2:48:07] MrGattz: other than whats already wrong with that
[2:48:09] MrGattz: them*
[2:48:14] GrimlicTV: *per account. so you can effictively do it infinitely
[2:48:21] TweakT: it's just slow honeydicking
[2:48:25] mavericks312: i wasnt interested in classic till they announced the boost
[2:48:27] TheGaoSora: #YOBO , You Only Boost Once!
[2:48:28] remedyt: @Towelliee the 1 time thing doesnt work because you can just make a new account im not against it just see the issue
[2:48:28] xXSiebzehnXx: Yup, play the game the way you want. Back in middle school I had a friend who swore that his Pokémon were better because he didn’t use rare candies, I smashed him every time.
[2:48:28] jioxthelock: right imagine how much money that is smart person @GrimlicTV
[2:48:28] wisperuna: @Towelliee and if it is pricied like a normal one
[2:48:32] SteveSD: player base will be healthier without boosting noobs
[2:48:36] wisperuna: @Towelliee ppl will cheapout :D
[2:48:36] ZIKERZ: wat boost
[2:48:36] Thills_: preach it sister
[2:48:37] Mr_Keefs: ya, tbc neds boosters to buy all the sweaty mats that classic players have been prepping
[2:48:40] Murlocz: @GrimlicTV You better be ready for multiboxers KEKW
[2:48:41] jokermines: No it won't lol
[2:48:42] caboose1029: im gonna boost. fuck lvling in classic
[2:48:44] Sincline387: level 60 in full nax gear with gold cap "that level 58 in leveling blues will unbalance my play"
[2:48:45] Ruzel_: @8_stages im a booster my self waht i meant ppl after the announcment hated boosters cz they are stacking gold and they dont want blizz to think to make a gold cap for ppl
[2:48:48] jokermines: The boost will bring players
[2:48:50] Brodih_: what happens with the pally and lock epic mount quests, do they become easier when TBC launches ?
[2:48:50] TheCliffyShow: They health of the game matters more then your nostalgia.
[2:48:52] jokermines: That's a fact
[2:48:55] clool: !TBC
[2:48:56] Moobot: We want YOU for a WoW TBC raiding guild! Apply now! || http://towelliee.com/tbc || We will be choosing Azuresong Horde for our TBC server! Start leveling now! || Not playing Pally, no Blood Elfs yet || No TBC Launch date yet.
[2:49:00] jokermines: If they like it... they'll stay
[2:49:03] crumbler81: LUL tbc community would be fine without boosts
[2:49:05] GRVPHX: mara boosts now in classic are like going all day non stop
[2:49:07] Xanigh: I guess it matter how much the boost cost
[2:49:14] PacioliNB: or they just get boosted by mages for gold
[2:49:14] Pyriel4711: Will it become possible to boost an alliance shaman to 58?
[2:49:14] Thills_: @jokermines so how will it not? hmm please elaborate
[2:49:16] TweakT: they are tho
[2:49:17] wisperuna: @Towelliee ooo no we get 3 spells
[2:49:21] Polskipete: also got 12 levels to learn ur class
[2:49:28] MOLAR305: I'm considering playing tbc bc of the boost, otherwise, no chance in hell. I already lvled that 14 years ago
[2:49:28] SteveSD: boosters are 100% noob frenzy
[2:49:31] jokermines: How will not what?
[2:49:32] tookozy: cant boost draenei or blood elves @coloradostrong
[2:49:33] Kinghorn: frostbolt frostbolt frostbolt
[2:49:33] MuttonChopins: dranei and belf wont be able to be boosted @PacioliNB
[2:49:37] thegrreatzzz: how much is the gold cap?
[2:49:42] TheCliffyShow: Not like someone is going to play a warrior and be like, "how do I throw a fireballs".
[2:49:43] FatChase: The people that complain about the blizzard boost are the same ones that get boosted in Mara/Scarlet Monestary @Towelliee
[2:49:43] jokermines: It's not.. they're a players who are knee-deep in classic
[2:49:44] Kagoon46: Youll learn more 58-70 than 1-58
[2:49:45] Murlocz: Considering we have some changes can we have goblins already?
[2:49:47] jokermines: Who don't want to level again
[2:49:48] Dr_ShockLoL: @ruzel_ i understand the gold concern, but its not a worry. you have dungeons to farm which doesnt stop your gold making. be smart about how your farm gold. there are tons of dungeons/raids to farm from 55-60 you can farm for gold and tons of it.
[2:49:50] Darzetti_: basically
[2:49:52] Thills_: @tookozy  thats not really an issue you can still play other races
[2:49:53] TweakT: i play sub in retail it aint complicated :)
[2:50:01] beckett3a: 3 buttons? man I WISH
[2:50:06] thegrreatzzz: @Towelliee how much is the gold cap?
[2:50:07] matteus7s: you can buy dungeon boosts with gold so it doesn't matter really
[2:50:08] jokermines: Not everyone loves the levelling process lol
[2:50:14] PacioliNB: @TacoVendor93 sounds good, druid doesnt get to be one of thosee

[2:50:15] GrimlicTV: leveling in TBC isnt even hard. the boost isnt necessary
[2:50:23] TheCliffyShow: Not like someone is going to play a warrior and be like, "how do I throw a fireball?"
[2:50:27] jokermines: in your opinion though mate
[2:50:30] tookozy: @coloradostrong i accidently clicked you meant to reply to someone else lol sry
[2:50:34] Thills_: @jokermines youre right a lot of people dont thats why people will buy the boost
[2:50:38] whamtv: That’s the problem with retail, it’s soooo hard to get good at a class because they’re so in depth I feel.
[2:50:40] mavericks312: @GrimlicTV no one wants to level thru toxic vanill
[2:50:41] SteveSD: it should be like when blizz was a company worth a damn, not this changes for more profit
[2:50:44] Tyraze: i played warrior in classic, i played a shaman in tbc when it first came out im 100% using the boost to get my shaman up to speed
[2:50:45] SteveSD: toxic
[2:50:46] Wulfgrym: Boost is awesome and those who don't like it will just have to live with it
[2:50:46] whamtv: If you’re new
[2:50:46] Thills_: @tookozy  all good man :)
[2:50:51] Murlocz: @GrimlicTV People arent boosting for tbc leveling, they boosting cuz classic leveling takes too long
[2:50:56] remedyt: were an age of instant gratification now if its not fast its a "waste" we cant just play and have fun anymore
[2:50:58] pENKELTss: !TBC

[2:51:01] GrimlicTV: leveling isnt bullshit. its part of the game
[2:51:03] rocthenite: soda poppin talking about "the jurney" when he farmed SM the whole time
[2:51:05] Coaltino: TRUEING
[2:51:15] iRustyWagon: absolute no changes
[2:51:16] Vivelli: @GrimlicTV then they can lvl if they want lol
[2:51:20] Wulfgrym: @GrimlicTV then lvl all you like, its one boost
[2:51:21] itsbananas01: @rocthenite KEKW
[2:51:23] Ruzel_: @8_stages i understand that but come and tell the ppl in my server who just shit talk boosters and they just ignore you and u keep talking to your self in LFG chat
[2:51:24] TweakT: its just dumbing down the game
[2:51:24] Weeaboo__Chad: The speedrun mentality definitely came from retail. Most guilds did no obsess over speedrunning vanilla raids during the Pserver days
[2:51:24] Coaltino: more like soda poopin ahaha
[2:51:24] MuttonChopins: leveling isnt part of the game in TBC
[2:51:25] SteveSD: if you want boosting play retail
[2:51:30] matteus7s: no please no
[2:51:31] Murlocz: @GrimlicTV Tell that to ppl leveling with mage boosts day and night KEKW
[2:51:36] Mahca_: my only concern is the effect it may have with people boosting professional alts
[2:51:36] MysticalOS: blizz is gonna make their money off boosts from bots :D
[2:51:37] matteus7s: not the token
[2:51:40] TheCliffyShow: Transmogs and pet battles!
[2:51:41] PacioliNB: I would rather people buy it and pay Blizzard than these bot farms for gold
[2:51:44] MysticalOS: The gold per hour bots can earn, and how slow blizz is to ban them, boosts are a drop in bucket. start 13 accounts and boost to 58 instantly, back up and running after ban wave instantly.
[2:51:46] Jawis: wasn't recruit a friend around in TBC? I feel like we had that, so wtf are people even talk about HYPERS

[2:51:54] GrimlicTV: mage boosting isnt an argument for paid boosting. because mage boosting is clearly unintended and shouldve been nerfed months ago
[2:51:55] rocthenite: staysafe is a hack who leech off of esfand
[2:51:57] whamtv: Add the token, less people will buy gold which fucks the economy
[2:52:00] Dr_ShockLoL: @remedyt welcome to evolution of gaming, not instant gratification. classic wow leveling is in no way optimized and enjoyable lol. its 2021, not 2004. there are tons of better leveling in other games
[2:52:03] GrandpaTippy: King level take

[2:52:45] TweakT: boosted chars quit faster
[2:52:46] ZIKERZ: the elite gron area right
[2:52:47] Shidopie: Dno whats up with the drama with boosting right know everyone is getting their characters boosted in dungeons paying someone gold with their rmt gold
[2:52:48] xXSiebzehnXx: That’s a trek
[2:52:56] rocthenite: @SteveSD i bet you hate fun
[2:52:56] Asyrr1: Yeah I think they tended to bc players with the boost by keeping them specifically in bc they can’t use those characters on classic servers

[2:53:14] toobaked1987: @Towelliee I am excited for TBC BECAUSE of the boost. Fuck Classic leveling. 150+ hour grind.
[2:53:18] SteveSD: @rocthenite  just the opposite, i enjoy playing the game and earning things, not being a wallet warrior

[2:54:14] matteus7s: Your tauren looks so slow with his big mount compared to my little gnome running around on a chicken
[2:54:20] ristlon: Token is 100% coming. Between bots and GDKP, there’s just no other way.
[2:54:21] MOLAR305: the China classic servers have tokens lol
[2:54:41] TweakT: so classic peeps designed and fucked up the game
[2:54:44] Frank4LuLz: @Towelliee  i want duel spec and tokens...take my money!!!!
[2:54:56] PacioliNB: Hell I notice a lot of the big no changes people are all about changes now anyway.. I mesn Esfand was pretty happy about seal of blood for him on Alliance wasnt he..
[2:55:00] Thills_: tbc is just better classic
[2:55:12] SteveSD: @xXSiebzehnXx so dont be part of the problem, not hard to not play pay to win games
[2:55:35] MysticalOS: the nochanges people were begging for changes a week into classic. "wait, this is too easy, on private they changed stuff to be harder"..
[2:55:45] Maldinger_der_Edellurker: still trash dps KEKW
[2:55:46] PacioliNB: Exactly, but he was all NO CHANGES but when it benfits him.. you know suddenly the wind changes
[2:55:49] Venkxx: so the boost is pay to win now? lol, we play different games
[2:55:55] xXSiebzehnXx: @stevesd you’re just being combative and naive
[2:56:01] Mystirose: But I can't have my white haired black skinned blue-eyed blood elf with the troll hairstyle in BC  *weeps*
[2:56:03] MysticalOS: they played private so long they thought "nochanges" mean t like private for some reason, but private changed so much

[2:59:49] SteveSD: most people arent streamers so its better, but todays world is botched
[2:59:51] Lumimyrsky: To me personally Wrath will always be the best expansion WoW has ever done. HahaHide
[3:00:00] King_Anarki: What tool tip is that?
[3:00:05] Kromede: can confirm
[3:00:05] Thills_: wrath was peak WoW
[3:00:11] Screamnsteam: @lumimyrsky Kappa
[3:00:18] PacioliNB: cant wait for my priest to go shadow!!
[3:00:20] Dr_ShockLoL: @SteveSD there was no streaming then, so of course not. but forums were a thing, and chat rooms. they made an influence, just not as much.
[3:00:30] Coaltino: He’s a paladin of course he like BC guys

[3:00:38] 3dRes: towBolvar towBolvar towBolvar
[3:00:38] Tzarvahl: @drkdemon808469 wrath killed wow, in the sense it created a large group of people that favored easy content (wrath), who would never accept anything slightly more challenging aka cata. if wrath kept BC difficulty, then went into cata, game wouldve been fine
[3:00:39] Mitchendo64: Yea Wrath to Uld sounds about right

[3:01:25] TweakT: all streamers are trying to make money monkaW
[3:01:28] GingerPurple: unpopular opinion ulduar should have been the last raid and ICC the second to last
[3:01:42] SteveSD: @8_stages  yeah games were better designed before streamers for sure, chats are just mostly toxic adn trolls
[3:01:45] Mitchendo64: No honesty in the streaming business
[3:01:52] Lumimyrsky: Ulduar was such a good raid though. I seriously loved every damn minute I spent in there
