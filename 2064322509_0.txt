[0:13:15] Roadskii: Sadly no
[0:14:53] hyqu94: yet you play on wow settings 1?
[0:14:55] Surarn: Just solve that part with having bad eyesight
[0:16:06] Sco: !LAPTOP
[0:16:06] Nightbot: Razer Blade 15" (2021) specs https://imgur.com/a/VmgN2bq
[0:16:22] hyqu94: thats really odd
[0:17:43] Roadskii: I have got  Alienware - m17 R5 17.3" 360Hz FHD Gaming Laptop - AMD Ryzen 9 - 16GB Memory - NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3070 Ti - 1TB SSD - Dark Side of the Moon but I am in the market of a new laptop at some point too
[0:18:17] Roadskii: Dec 16, 2022
[0:18:37] lubricanto: I would up the amount of ram
[0:18:43] lubricanto: THe card is good enough
[0:18:55] hyqu94: Yes
[0:18:56] hyqu94: you can swap ram
[0:18:59] lubricanto: Open it
[0:18:59] anakeen777: some laptopps have 1 empty slot
[0:19:25] Docoda: No
[0:19:30] lubricanto: just use youtube mate there are vids how to
[0:19:34] anakeen777: ram and hdd are quite easy access in latptops. rest like gfx cpu ofc not
[0:19:34] lubricanto: And then do it youreself
[0:20:00] ryry0695: overclockers
[0:20:07] Sco: !laptop
[0:20:07] Nightbot: Razer Blade 15" (2021) specs https://imgur.com/a/VmgN2bq
[0:20:23] Docoda: it has at least 2
[0:20:59] lubricanto: It has 2 slots
[0:21:02] Docoda: 16GB dual-channel DDR4-2933MHz (8GB x 2) Expandable up to 64GB
[0:21:11] lubricanto: so buy one 16 and you have 32
[0:21:13] Docoda: Dual channel so two slots yeh
[0:21:42] ryry0695: with a laptop and cpu the last letter on the intel cpus you get like k, h etc they are all for different stuff
[0:21:56] Galanax87: Yo sco how are you doing :D
[0:22:10] Docoda: I suppose your laptop is plugged in atn?
[0:22:10] Keany16: Anyone the best place i can upgrade my PC in the UK? CBA to research all the parts etc again.
[0:22:13] lubricanto: Wow still uses alot of ram and cpu instead of the gfx
[0:22:15] Docoda: atm*
[0:22:31] Roadskii: IIt looks like I can upgrade mine to 32gb according to Dell's website
[0:22:55] anakeen777: whats gpu % usage. try msiafterburner osd
[0:23:34] ryry0695: thats one thing i wish they did with laptops is being able to upgrade more stuff not just a couple things
[0:23:52] ryry0695: instead of having to buy a new laptop
[0:23:55] anakeen777: if gpu is below 90% then its just bad w0w code poorly optimized on cpu side. 50 fps oin valdraken is common
[0:24:10] Cabbageman007: slootSmug slootFistLove
[0:25:14] hyqu94: Tbh valdrakken is a shit place to be it makes everyone lag
[0:25:17] MethodChatBot: Method Class Guides, Amirdrassil Boss Guides and Mythic+ Dungeon Guides are now available --> https://link.method.gg/sco-guides
[0:25:28] anakeen777: is it single channel?
[0:25:37] anakeen777: you can check in CPUz
[0:25:52] Docoda: 16gb these days isnt rly enough anymore, especially if u have obs running and some chrome tabs open
[0:26:15] anakeen777: dual channel requires 2 sticks (or maybe double sided ram stick idk)
[0:26:15] Roadskii: Chome is a HUGE resource hog
[0:26:26] lubricanto: My pc at work i play wow on a GTX 570
[0:26:33] lubricanto: Lowest settings but it works
[0:26:47] cheechpluschong: !addons
[0:26:47] Nightbot: Sco's WAs and addons can be found at https://discord.gg/sco
[0:27:10] anakeen777: but other than that its just bad w0w code. and the only situation you would need more ram is when its full and it starts using page file on disk- causing stutters
[0:27:21] Docoda: Can you show your advanced settings in graphics?
[0:27:35] cheechpluschong: everything looks nice and clean still
[0:27:48] cheechpluschong: ty
[0:28:09] Galanax87: how long are you gonna be in denmark for now :D
[0:31:00] anakeen777: that cpu ranges from 1.9ghz to 2.3 to 4.6. maybe using hig perf profile would cause it run higher. it could be using low ghz cause w0w usage was just 20%
[0:32:25] Roadskii: I am just getting things ready for my big move next month
[0:32:49] Galanax87: nope wife and the baby are going to see there grandmother and ji ust got work to do :D

[0:48:28] Cyberangel7777: I wish Blizzard would add the allied race Lightforged Undead for the Horde with same kind of skin as Caelia, Nathanos.
[0:49:00] LegoLich: Cyberangel - it's likely coming in last titan

[0:49:29] Cyberangel7777: @LegoLich OMG!!!
[0:49:53] anakeen777: this boss used to be single target
[0:50:23] NovaKosova: Imagine Sco as hunter, and not as any tank Kappa
[0:50:39] anakeen777: hes just playing whats most fun
[0:51:11] LegoLich: there's somehting you can turtle immune on this boss but its name escapes me
[0:51:38] LegoLich: Ele Shammie is looking fun as well
[0:52:14] anakeen777: is Haste increasing Barbed Shot DoT damage or only ability cooldown?
[0:52:26] LegoLich: both
[0:53:09] queenloud1: @sco I want to get into M+ I have only pvp  since like wod. It's going in as a dh tank going to be too much for learning?
[0:53:29] LegoLich: DH Tank is pretty easy to learn, but hard to master
[0:53:37] LegoLich: it's hyper mobile which is fun
[0:54:03] queenloud1: Is tank rule for new to m+ going to be a bad way to learn?
[0:54:21] anakeen777: its much better after they made spirit bomb passice
[0:54:25] queenloud1: Role.  Sorry on phone ATM lol
[0:54:36] LegoLich: no, but i would do a couple of the "follower dungeons" to get used to tanking
[0:55:16] anakeen777: so right now game has no DoT that doesnt benefit from Haste? what about murder of crows?
[0:56:37] anakeen777: in bfa i had a feel that stacks of barbed crit 9% are doing nothing. my crit on dummy was same from autoshot testing with buff on/off

[1:00:41] 123Sepi123: does method compete in mdi?
[1:01:15] Daemonrek: Id love to see that
[1:02:08] anakeen777: how much augmentation evoker is increasing party dmg?
[1:02:27] Healofsteel: You can feign right before cast and if he targeting you it cancels last I checked.
[1:02:35] anakeen777: to make it pay off having one in even with dmg below tank

[1:39:30] pinchdd: kinky
[1:39:37] AdelineFrost: only for sleeping tho
[1:39:57] AdelineFrost: but being conscious of breathing through your nose and not your mouth is a good start

[1:40:44] lassne: dear sco pls be nice to my guildy
[1:41:14] pinchdd: its awful because when i watch footage of me raiding back through my videos, you can hear me mouth breathing because im so focused on the game
[1:43:42] AdelineFrost: @pinchdd Scott does that a LOT too, his breathing is super loud. I think maybe it‚Äôs more unnatural for men idk
