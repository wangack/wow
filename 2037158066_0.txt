[1:48:59] kipsate321: can u inspelct kiea for talents for me im curious
[1:49:04] Lara_TV_: Timer is already tight on Tyran and bolstering can really slow down the tail end of pulls with random deaths/having to be extra careful
[1:49:04] Entelligenz: its important to lust on pul tho otherwise your doomed

[2:35:56] Waradin24: real LOL
[2:36:21] Lara_TV_: That's been me this week as well
[2:36:26] parzivals0918: why dont you raid on druid?
[2:36:31] Piaggio: gotta get those weeklies done soon pepeLaugh
[2:36:45] meowphietm: cause druid sucks in raid and you can play priest MW or hpal
[2:39:07] Waradin24: its why my druids name is alwaysoom
[2:39:30] suinetel: Shoul rdruid take kick in M+ PuGs? Using the kick in these high damage seasona feel clunky.

[2:49:25] Celissah: Only me getting stutters?
[2:49:59] GentleYame: xD
[2:53:08] drumminbacon: might sound dumb but i'm getting into resto druid for the first time. what's the most efficient way to get 2 afflicted if the group isn't helping?
[2:54:11] Celissah: efflo around one and dispell the other is what I usually do.
[2:54:26] bartfux: @drumminbacon make them help. and if they are weiners, Natures Cure one, and then Rejuv the other and hit it with swiftmend.
[2:54:55] caradea_: tell them before the key starts that they absolutely have to dispell, and if they dont agree find a new group
[2:55:15] bartfux: if you're fast enough, you can dispel both because the cast time is longer than 8 seconds, but hats riding the edge a bit.
[2:55:41] drumminbacon: haha yeah, i'm just preparing for the inevitability that i'll be getting 2 sometimes and it didn't seem as straight forward as my priest with all the hots
[2:56:44] caradea_: spriests, mages, druids, monks, palas, shamans, they all can and should dispell
[2:56:48] bartfux: Afflicted week is booty cheeks for all healers except shamans.
[2:57:20] drumminbacon: on my priest i can dispel and power word life or whatever it's called.
[2:58:21] drumminbacon: i think i'll do the swiftmend thing. three globals is better for my anxiety than ho[ing one hot is good enough XD
[2:59:25] bartfux: @drumminbacon i've not had issues with it. you can also hit it with a boosted regrowth, but thats RNG on if you have a proc. and i'd rather save those for healing my group instead.
[2:59:41] TurambarWOW: Chat how much io for 20s chat ? 2400 is enough
[3:00:35] ren0m: Surely non-intentional
[3:00:56] bartfux: SURELY. KEKW
[3:01:50] ren0m: But can we get the old convoke back
[3:02:00] ren0m: It looks like druids are farting on other people
[3:04:41] ren0m: There's quite a delay between YT and Twitch
[3:09:48] Sheepamig: Read the screen bro
[3:10:02] hipposlam: this is a rough week for healers man

[3:18:43] kelly_mac06: great news healers
[3:19:42] sheenayy: best way to deal withafflicted affix?
[3:20:05] Korupcija_: get weakaura
[3:20:27] ren0m: @kelly_mac06 I smell a jb Tweet
[3:21:52] sheenayy: what addon to do mouseover  for afflicted
[3:22:08] Guffels: im so tierd of it eating my atonement from rapture
[3:22:48] mc_chrisco: you mean radiance?
[3:23:00] kelly_mac06: yea but you're not healing afflicted right? it's just a dispell
[3:23:05] drumminbacon: rezan targetting afflicted was the single greatest bug i've encountered. shouldn't have fixed it
[3:23:28] deciheals: As a healer I have thought about this and think I would prefer the smart heals to hit them.
[3:23:37] yctnm: I'd rather have my dispel for like totem boss in throne
[3:23:38] kelly_mac06: ah okay i play a class that cant do anything for afflicted so that makes sense, i thought it was just dispels
[3:23:38] tugusham: but thats a design problem at all
[3:23:42] kelly_mac06: that's fair
[3:24:51] drumminbacon: i don't really like how hard they can be to target sometimes through other mobs. smart heals hitting them would make that a lot easier to deal with
[3:25:32] stormranger47: so a target macro also does not work on afflicted?
[3:25:53] kelly_mac06: ah that's super fucking shitty
[3:27:48] hunterzx: incorp is borderline acceptable but i hate it. Afflicted is the dumbest shit ever
[3:28:12] MisoDruid: A macro for afflicted would have been like the Decursive add-on back in the day…
[3:28:22] imiserycloud: #bringpridefullback

[3:32:43] drumminbacon: it has been nerfed a lot since then. it's a design thing at this point
[3:32:54] xephr__: I raid in world 100, Tindral is cancer and should have been a boss in wow
[3:33:03] JakobLowrizzle: agree. let it be a banger for them in week 1 or 2. then nerf the ever living crap oout of it lol

[3:35:41] somethineuw: what addon makes ppls msges appear on top of their head

[3:53:05] Chazmiklmikl: @jdotb did you end up making an MDI team
[3:53:59] healchoc: why are feral druids non existent this season? my returning friend is maiming and there is never a 2nd feral
[3:54:04] qinec: is it because theres already a druid dps?
[3:54:18] qinec: yeah makes sense:)
[3:56:10] theBroHam: @Nydiot tell them you won't heal them unless they help
[3:56:35] healchoc: answer the feral q! lol
[3:57:09] Minirawr: @jdotb Try not to stand in the swirls on first boss this time kekw
[3:57:24] Perry_TP: The Feral Question
[3:58:29] healchoc: for sure thanks. he’s 20s tops but ya they seem to have been very marginal all dragon. Ty!
[3:58:54] healchoc: meta chases a guess (holy priest main)
[3:58:57] qinec: @jdotb do you think aug will ever fall out? Kinda want to move from healing but still be able to support the party, but im scared aug will become unwanted in pugs eventually
[4:00:16] tabxzer: Why are you pugging as druid and not superior discpriest?
[4:00:34] qinec: thats an awesome answer tysm
[4:01:12] Geysi82: the d in jdotb stands for druid
[4:02:47] FuraiEU: i like that mindset
[4:04:18] healchoc: when does s4 start? I hear some ppl saying 1-2 months. I feel like that’s too soon idk.
[4:05:06] Perry_TP: they have set amount of days between patches this expansion more or less
[4:06:06] healchoc: this is the best answer I’ve heard on this by a mile
[4:07:12] DONGAMAN: grats on tindral
[4:07:15] heykeds: i wonder how this will affect late tier CE guilds

[4:11:50] drumminbacon: @tabxzer most people who are pushing any form of content play alts. not sure what having different specs be good or bad has to do with anything
[4:11:58] healchoc: I’m here for a key at this point lol! what’s the biggest sleeper class you have seen in a high key? where you thought they would be low but they were just crazy dps
[4:12:35] tabxzer: @drumminbacon becosue having alts is very time consuming, and this game isnt LoL where youc an just log in on whataver class is good
[4:12:40] Dotctori: +30 DHT so free
[4:13:45] tabxzer: @drumminbacon and no I do not think you should be gated by some monkey at blizzard reworking some class to be litterly broken, and you get fked becosue u dont have a geared x class.
[4:15:44] lixtix: just drop mirror images or treants?

[4:25:13] kuntoilija: whys there a boomkin in your group when you are already pleying rdruid?
[4:25:18] kuntoilija: blasphemy
[4:25:19] healchoc: to be fair- you can get fully kitted in m+ week one. I started pvp 2 weeks ago and I capped conq in 7 days. I feel bad for pvp mains for real
[4:25:20] abeldank: how could you possible need more crests?
[4:25:31] kuntoilija: for alts, obviously
[4:25:57] abeldank: cap is so high can't you upgrade almost every piece to max now?
[4:26:14] kuntoilija: only need to do a 100 m+ dungeons
[4:26:22] kuntoilija: oh btw you arent getting any invites cuz ur ilvl sucks
[4:26:22] abeldank: that has nothing to do with the cap
[4:26:35] kuntoilija: did i talk about cap

[4:26:38] kuntoilija: bruh
[4:26:40] healchoc: I only buy the conq gear. I have 4p, trinkets, staff and wrist. and I’m capped, I don’t want honor gear
[4:26:54] abeldank: "They remove conquest cap but wont touch crests. M'kay Blizzard." the implication is crest cap... are you slow?
[4:26:55] kuntoilija: literally double the crests at the end of dungeon, would help a lot already
[4:27:07] kuntoilija: BUT WONT TOUCH CRESTS
[4:27:09] kuntoilija: WHERE

[4:28:05] Perry_TP: arguing in twitch chat is crazy
[4:28:08] ren0m: This chats feels like an M+ dungeon
[4:28:30] kuntoilija: They remove conquest cap but wont buff crest drop amounts. M'kay Blizzard.
[4:28:32] healchoc: I was enjoying the conq talk but it just turned to a 1v1 lol

[5:14:23] chiefwakka: Wow’s tanking mechanics make tanks believe mitigation is 100% their responsibility.
[5:15:12] DrMeat: is it not?
[5:16:15] chiefwakka: Majority yes, but i feel externals exist for a reason right?  Just my thought.
[5:16:24] Buffiin: what spell do you use for the second afflicted?
[5:17:33] DrMeat: sry didnt mean to sound so aggro, i just consider calling for externals the same as your own cds. just instead of hitting a button you communicate with your team
[5:19:02] chiefwakka: No worries, didn’t take it that way. I see your point though 😃
[5:20:17] StreamElements: fresh youtube shorts going up 3x a week on https://www.youtube.com/@jdotb
[5:28:11] hipposlam: did we get some score for this key?
[5:30:01] Buffiin: what spell do you use for the second afflicted? Obviously ideal if someone else gets it but if you have to?
[5:31:16] RayeAerinae: can you show your healing breakdown for the last key?
[5:31:23] Buffiin: got it. makes sense. ive tried regrowth and its a pain.
[5:32:38] RayeAerinae: thank you
[5:48:16] hipposlam: i feel like that was the first time in a while where you finished this boss without swearing at it
[5:48:39] theBroHam: that's impressive honestly
[5:48:43] Hate_POV: low key, that fight was perfectly played
[5:49:04] INKkni: Awesome gameplay, Thank you! Is that a Weakaura that highlights the players when you can decurse them?
[5:49:17] Hate_POV: @INKkni  Elvui
[5:50:09] INKkni: Awesome, Thanks. I'm going to have to see how to change that setting. It's super helpful
[5:52:47] INKkni: Are you not using Rejuv at all ?
[5:53:45] nixar1: @INKkni only if he moves and needs something to activate swiftmend
[5:54:24] Archmage_Michael: Do you think the will make gearing faster soon? like dropping more crests? I geared 3 chars to 486 and I'm bored but I can't get myself to farm all the needed crests for another alt
[5:54:58] theBroHam: maybe toward the end of the season? Not sure
[6:05:33] hipposlam: god dam this is intense
[6:05:38] zerahaha: did he just shadowmeld that?

[6:31:28] INKkni: Do you have a video on how to get the highlight around unitframes to show who you can decurse?
[6:33:55] nixar1: I think he means when a person is in speed zone with a debuff on 2nd boss in Galakronds
[6:34:05] nixar1: that's weakaura?
[6:34:56] sseijas: what potion do you use¿

[7:30:11] TBouse: tree on pull to carry the first 40 seconds, then use barks/trinkets/etc for a minute, then tree to end the dot phase
[7:31:33] dadgamer_o7: me :)
[7:31:47] kosalol1: I kinda hope last boss in shield in fall would be % based same first boss in rise instead of time
[7:32:06] kosalol1: curator?
[7:32:06] chaarp: i prefer tgp, but it's not because of the bosses
[7:32:08] PNZTK: you don't watch a 8 minute boss fight you watch 4 teams doing 8 minutes boss fights at the same time

[7:33:35] Marpell: how do you cope with it?
[7:34:01] bearbro9: I think they should get it back
[7:34:08] bearbro9: have both m+ and challenge modes
[7:34:31] Marpell: why not both
[7:35:45] nixar1: imagine torghast-like m+ with anima powers
[7:35:47] kosalol1: Imo could try something like that as a seasonal event that last few weeks to see how ppl like it and if its popular aim to do it fulltime thing
[7:35:54] dadgamer_o7: they just need to put tindral in m+
[7:35:56] IctinusWoW: i think this is the worst that tyrannical has felt since legion (and legion was just cause lol one shot fiesta)
[7:35:58] dadgamer_o7: problem solved
[7:35:58] hebodiles: Brian Husky was well known as the "If Google was a guy" bit
[7:36:01] w0lfh4rt: I am so old, I played "charges only" in counterstrike, then came the round based mode. tbh - both modes were good but in a competitive environment only one mode survives
[7:36:09] kelly_mac06: have fun!
[7:36:16] kelly_mac06: mexican is always a good choice
[7:36:19] luffys_strawhat: @nixar1 there already was something like that in shadowlands
