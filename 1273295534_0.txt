[0:44:59] realcacattaa: i almoust forgot this stream WutFace
[0:45:03] NickLeonhearth: As of right now, this mission is classified as Rare. It does appear to be repeatable, though, if RNG likes you enough to present it twice. You also must have at least level 98 followers. If you have the mission and do not attempt it, it will disappear after rollover (some assumption here, but it will eventually disappear if not attempted).

[1:13:39] NoSelfJustice: @aimassistallen more fool you lul <3
[1:13:49] aimassistallen: @swordart_19 So I can use the catchup mechanics
[1:13:57] aimassistallen: @noselfjustice :(
[1:14:02] swordart_19: @aimassistallen what nonsense you talk about
[1:14:10] Herzenliegen: I hate this zone till we got flying.
[1:14:19] pcpro_ish: @aimassistallen i just switch cov's so i feel you
[1:14:21] swordart_19: @aimassistallen I bet you have no idea why you even did it
[1:14:35] DeanoTV: when u hit 80 renown in 1 char u can freely switch covenant
[1:14:40] FluffyDooom: 9 hours for 28 renown? Ouch, that's slow :P
[1:14:42] Thoreya: 8.2 was so good <3
[1:15:11] swordart_19: @deanotv nope you can before
[1:15:21] Herzenliegen: I still need to go back and get the one ray mount.
[1:15:21] Moobot: Who wins? https://strawpoll.com/cz3q7xfco
[1:15:27] pcpro_ish: yeah i just did it at 32 renown
[1:15:42] DeanoTV: no, its a thing since 9.1.5, if u have 80 renown, all ur chars can freely switch renown without doing the weekly quest
[1:15:58] swordart_19: People doing stuff and they themselves don't know what is hilarious xD
[1:16:01] galifax2: i didnt know that LUL
[1:16:01] aimassistallen: @swordart_19 I didn’t it one for flying, and 2 for the renown catchup and being able to switch cov whenever I want with no punishment. My highest renown toon was a toon I didn’t want to main (just coming back since the beginning of SL) so the best thing to do was finish the renown to 80 on the highest toon and use the renown, and other catchup mechanics on my new main :)
[1:16:33] NoSelfJustice: @aimassistallen what main did you go for?
[1:16:53] aimassistallen: @noselfjustice DH
[1:16:53] swordart_19: @aimassistallen you know doing story and passively you get it by playing.

[1:18:57] FluffyDooom: Naah, renown from comp stop heavly drops off at like 60-64, i tried it for a while (to get exalted with arathi dudes as well) before going back to running 5-6 minute layer 9 torghasts runs :P

[1:19:49] Broomba: i have xCq jjuice, hype sauce, strawberry short cake and red ooze @towelliee on the way
[1:20:11] iEmiIio: @Towelliee How many mounts do you have? And have left to get?

[1:53:17] Gregclsn: It only started counting attempts for me after my second timewalking dungeon for some reason
[1:53:19] Cedamaldo: @Towelliee check under Mounts (group) is a sub category in the main poput

[1:53:58] GGunk: time walking is heroic
[1:54:00] chavodk: its bugged for me also
[1:54:22] BardtheBowman: you have to add bosses to the lua to fix the timereaver to Rarity correctly
[1:54:38] FranciscoTheMage: That prediction doesnt seem realistic. I know people hate elaborate systems but they've always come up with a new system. theres no way they'd copy paste SL systems into an anniversary expac
[1:54:40] Donswag3: yeah Forge of Souls should count towards the quest, but it didnt drop one of those 500 timewalking badges items for me
[1:54:49] stratiss: the addon may not recognize Forge of Souls since it was newly added
[1:54:59] KaisenSiru: It probably hasn't recognized FoS yet since its new
[1:55:00] Inthezonewow: Forge of Souls is only recently new to timewalking I think
[1:55:05] swordart_19: @franciscothemage what anniversary?
[1:55:12] Tethyr: Yep if you get Forge it won't count
[1:55:20] Khlaro: They put Forge of Souls in TW? duckMonkas
[1:55:20] Donswag3: yeah I think the issue with it not counting your attempts was Forge being recently added
[1:55:24] fridostv: What mount is he going for thru these timewalking? From the chest or drops or?
[1:55:25] swordart_19: Cause they eat whirlwind
[1:55:25] BardtheBowman: lust?
[1:55:30] FranciscoTheMage: the next expac is an anniversary date i thought
[1:55:32] Wcvechten: the whirlwind absolutley melts people

[1:58:01] Khlaro: Overlap it with FF14 next patch. . . duckKek
[1:58:01] swordart_19: @smashwow lol I feel opposite smooths out downtime
[1:58:04] Masterglint: the tierset is trash
[1:58:07] Donswag3: thoughts on the 2 legendaries not being available until after RWF?
[1:58:14] FranciscoTheMage: is it true Blizz has still not fully transitioned back to the office?
[1:58:20] roronoa929: Its good that they have founds and money to do it then.  6 months of ptr ? Pffff

[1:58:43] swordart_19: It is Pog
[1:58:46] Masterglint: the ret one specifically
[1:58:50] Kisswani: @Towelliee I saw your reply to Taliesin's tweet regarding Afrasiabi and Sylvanas story . is that a confirmed thing ?
[1:58:52] KythosMeltdown: prot war avatar 4 piece seems legit
[1:58:54] Donswag3: so have you officially joined Liquid?
[1:58:55] smashwow: @swordart_19 2 seconds of seraphim is kinda meh and too RNG-ish for ret. the wake reset can be really good for AOE if you get lucky on coin flips
[1:59:11] BardtheBowman: tanks have enough to focus on usually
[1:59:18] FranciscoTheMage: @Towelliee vs Taliesin
[1:59:27] swordart_19: @smashwow well Ret has no rng with it and 2sec enough for your next hit
[1:59:42] swordart_19: Xymix that tank grip is fishy

[2:00:44] akia03: nzoth spawing upside down
[2:00:58] smashwow: @swordart_19 uuuhhh... ret has massive RNG. Divine Purpose and Blade resets? you don't get DP procs on AOE or ST you are waaay behind other dps.
[2:01:10] doomester: @Towelliee same as Ny'oth
[2:01:12] Clicklesly: Think it's worse when a bug allows some teams to kill it and then they fix it before others get there :-I
[2:01:13] smashwow: you get the procs and you feel like a god though
[2:01:20] SonofHorus82: Why does this RWF feel more hype than ones we've had in the past?
[2:01:30] swordart_19: @smashwow you can opt in into these if you want it , without it is boring
[2:01:31] Kisswani: @doomester is that Nyalotha and N'zoth combined ? KEKW

[2:04:26] Kisswani: Liquid Thd POGGERS
[2:04:30] smashwow: i feel like if they let seraphim stack time off procs and you got lucky the tier would feel better. but 2 seconds is roughly a GCD and if you don't have a finisher pooled for that maybe proc. idk just feels awful. compared to say a Spirit priest where their tier set does the lords work all the time
[2:04:43] Lintgamer: Yeah jjust  go down

[2:29:05] whiph: what is the addon for enemy health bars?
[2:29:19] Colt_Engineer: they have to, when I tank on my bear a kyrian warrior always pulls aggro with their 40k burst dps
[2:29:27] Rexialiton: Can you change the way the proc looks like in ElvUi?

[2:31:15] swordart_19: Dratnos is GIGACHAD
[2:31:20] peinen: the seasonals this expansion have been pretty lackluster, prideful was the best and imo it was ok
[2:31:23] Nokterian: they made a blue post yesterday
[2:31:27] Nytaha: ngl that sounds good!
[2:31:32] Nokterian: it is in week 3 you will get your leggo

[2:31:40] smashwow: just saying honored for belt, exalted for memory = gg
[2:31:43] Colt_Engineer: I LOATHED prideful
[2:31:43] Snabido: Bring back infested 😠
[2:31:43] Aquadriel: I hope they change it to have cooler RWF, but as it is now it really doesnt affect a lot of people.
[2:31:44] Strife_PvP: prideful was dog
[2:31:45] subversv: i got tired of prideful :(
[2:31:48] errkkk_: prideful was great
[2:31:50] Ertra: i miss reaping ngl
[2:31:54] Samurai3434: What's up with your Turettes Wings?
[2:31:54] salsaboyirl: szn 2 was just boring as hell in terms of affixes imo
[2:31:56] Burmarck: Heal it and you will change your mind :D
[2:31:57] sweetiepiles: aw
[2:31:58] akia03: @Nokterian week 5
[2:32:00] mytherel: 2nd leggo should be available right away for sure
[2:32:01] swordart_19: @jarlan23 because game is about progression
[2:32:02] arcaniia007: awakened plz
[2:32:02] ijuki: They turn off devotion aura? DansGame
[2:32:05] xo_navi: What was the azshara one? that was awful KEKW

[2:32:09] sweetiepiles: they wioll never top awakended
[2:32:12] Kritex: resto sham was beating dk on damage lmao
[2:32:13] peinen: comparatively to reaping and awakened I dunno, just didn't scratch that same itch
[2:32:14] jukla12: yea 2nd lego should be out on 1st week of the patch Sadge
[2:32:17] luckfore: everyone went from this patch is coming out very soon to yea maybe march orso LUL
[2:32:20] anticensor_: still no 9.2 release date?
[2:32:22] Snabido: 😏
[2:32:25] naughtynurse123: The best way to do anything is to imagine there is no rwf just ignore limit and echo ever existing and make the game without considering them cusse They just keep punishing the community to keep those guys in place
[2:32:29] swordart_19: Begauling Enjoyer GIGACHAD
[2:32:33] Wcvechten: infested critters just running around
[2:32:35] dyslexican1: oneof the worst affexes they ever did
[2:32:41] xo_navi: corrupted was pretty cool too
[2:32:45] Madidius: Awakening was the best by far imo
[2:32:54] Samurai3434: All the Ok DK's want reaping back
[2:32:55] xo_navi: or awakened sorry
[2:32:58] xo_navi: whatever it was called
[2:33:01] swordart_19: @naughtynurse123 nothing in wow is limited or designed around them
[2:33:05] ijuki: Anything with % and mobs ... not a fan of that
[2:33:11] Davedaman26: what was the one where the ones you killed and after some amount of % they come back as ghosts that was fun
[2:33:16] Aquadriel: i personally liked begulling, made you actually use some kind of CC on the ladies
[2:33:17] sweetiepiles: THE GOAT
[2:33:18] BobbyVex: prideful was the. best affix. not even close.
[2:33:23] syla90: awakened has no buffs tho.. not good enough
[2:33:37] naughtynurse123: @swordart_19 hmm actually your wrong alot of things are revolving around them specially since bfa where streaming became a thing
[2:33:42] xo_navi: LUL Twilight dev
[2:33:42] ThisIzD: awaked was my first because i came back in 8.3 after quitting in cata.
[2:33:48] dyslexican1: Oneof the things i hate about M+ is all the skips.
[2:33:50] swordart_19: @naughtynurse123 which ?
[2:33:52] CrusaderNero: so when is this god damn patch coming
[2:33:53] arcaniia007: we had corruptions lulw

[2:34:00] Rexialiton: true KEKW
[2:34:02] subversv: whose fault is that
[2:34:07] swordart_19: Not everyone just people on social media .
[2:34:08] Sielu11628: @CrusaderNero When it is ready :)
[2:34:10] futomara01: make it bareable you mean
[2:34:12] FelPlague: awakened was good cause you needed a lot of skips, now you can clear the place and barely kill enough even without skips, so skips arnt really needed
[2:34:18] Strife_PvP: like it or not, no point wasting time not using it
[2:34:22] CrusaderNero: why the fuck would you do that for timewalking
[2:34:22] smashwow: i wouldn't call that a metric of success
[2:34:23] subversv: Kappa
[2:34:24] FelPlague: like the bfa dungeons had a lot more required trash then shadowlands
[2:34:25] Aquadriel: players fault ofc KEKW
[2:34:31] Sluggin1: I fuckin sharted in the sheets last night
[2:34:31] naughtynurse123: @swordart_19 not gonna go far back in bfa , a prime live example of it the new legendary system . And removal of coin at the start of sl
[2:34:35] draconisraccoonis: ya cuz alot of wow players are whiny little shits
[2:34:47] ContraRob: I don't hate the powers we get, I hate the borrowing. Would be great to keep them
[2:34:56] Thatsafy: @FelPlague temple of sneks pre awakened and without rogue KEKW
[2:35:00] Cyberangel89: @Towelliee I miss BfA
[2:35:05] xo_navi: bfa had some rough dungeons
[2:35:09] xo_navi: fuckin tol dagor
[2:35:10] ne0rmatrix: just ordered from instacart for the first time just now :)
[2:35:27] xo_navi: get to the top to have it bug out and pull 8 packs from the bottom
[2:35:27] ne0rmatrix: been sick in quarantine and wanted munchies
[2:35:30] Cyberangel89: @Towelliee I liked the dungeons from BfA compared to the ones from SL that are lame
[2:35:33] wester19: Been going for long or just started ?
[2:35:34] CrusaderNero: every power we obtain stays relevant and alive in whatever xpac it was in. so when thers timewalking events(like dung/raids), that gets activated again
[2:35:34] FelPlague: @Thatsafy oh dear god yeah...
[2:35:36] swordart_19: @naughtynurse123 that change with Lego literally benefits everyone since if you don't play few days you couldn't grind more to get it at same time.
[2:36:03] xo_navi: LUL wtf
[2:36:05] othraerir: fkn packers lol
[2:36:06] PToastman: whatr

[2:36:20] swordart_19: @naughtynurse123 and coin to get less loot over all still from raid fastest to get gear.
[2:36:20] smashwow: surprised it's not still going
[2:36:20] FelPlague: cause yeah BFA needed lots of skips, shadowlands dungeons dont need skips so awakened less good.
[2:36:21] Th3Hammer: LUL
[2:36:22] Th3Hammer: LMAO

[2:37:49] Wrizzik: you have the wrong hair for a Karen tbh
[2:37:58] crematedBrain: you know for a FACT that if you snitch on the neighbours, they will return it tenfold if you ever even watch TV on a loud volume lmao
[2:37:58] notdustinx: we dont have cops in Florida, the cops have us
[2:38:09] Lupine_Fury: y'all dont tell your neighbors you going to be making lots of noise?

[2:38:33] xirangeix: got 2 weeks off for lost ark
[2:38:34] LoseAlotLuke: when i see trainwrecks do 35+ hour streams regularly it blows my mind @Towelliee
[2:38:35] Kritex: @Lupine_Fury no respect these kids
[2:38:40] srze94: that pull is ballsy damn
[2:38:48] unresolved_broccoli: @NickLeonhearth Not call the fucking cops thats for sure
[2:38:57] errkkk_: when i saw HoA i thought halls of atonement. i need to go touch grass
[2:39:03] PadidinJones: Dks and Pallys were the shit back in WOLK
[2:39:07] swordart_19: @naughtynurse123 I benefit from it ,I like quests having rewards and I play for progression.

[2:46:33] LoseAlotLuke: In the UK there was 5000/1 for leicester to win the title, they did in 2016
[2:46:35] notdustinx: doesnt matter who your team is, Joey B is fun to watch jus like Mahomes
[2:46:42] SonofHorus82: not just the super bowl. Imagine the line on what it was for the Bengals to even make the playoffs.
[2:46:50] errkkk_: addon
[2:46:52] Donswag3: probably "you can't see me" or some shit

[2:47:52] magemaster225: you been watching peacemaker?

[2:47:58] upandaz: he had a great game huh
[2:48:07] coach_gainza: Burroiws sack as many times yesterday as the entire season lol
[2:48:07] SonofHorus82: @Jarlan23 Is this 1981??
[2:48:09] Euronymous77: As a Titans fan, I'm pretty depressed this morning. We obviously need an upgrade in QB.

[2:48:50] elbinn: as a bengals fan everytime he gets sacked im nervous about his ACL
[2:48:51] snowballefact: BITCOIN CAN BUY IN GAME ACCESORIES?
[2:48:52] Pippinn: some protection! as a dire hard bengals fan, they need a real Oline
[2:48:54] Wrizzik: and now Carson is getting run over weekly
[2:48:56] Niksen_99: Do you use Air Fryer for the chicken ? its super good and easy

[2:48:59] Donswag3: man dont make me cry, bringing up Luck and shit
[2:49:00] Sarocus: I heard Bangles instead of Bengal..
[2:49:03] Donswag3: This team right now would be PERFECT for him
[2:49:04] swordart_19: @snowballefact no
[2:49:07] HilariousMax: What's an o-line???
[2:49:09] theDirtyon3: @snowballefact are you having a stroke?
[2:49:09] magemaster225: burrows looks like you get him a 6 pack of natty after 9 sacks hes good
[2:49:28] snowballefact: SO NO CRYPTOCURRENCY ACCEPTED INGAME?
[2:49:34] Donswag3: Too many close games lost, and then didnt have the killer instinct to end the season
[2:49:39] swordart_19: @snowballefact yes
[2:49:39] elbinn: bengals knew their OL was shit though going into the year - thats why everyone was baffled they took Ja'Marr over an O-Line
[2:49:42] theDirtyon3: @snowballefact no fuck off
[2:49:51] snowballefact: ok
[2:49:54] SonofHorus82: I wouldnt say it was bad games at the beginning. Colts had a super difficult schedule to start. The end of the season is where they shit the bed.
[2:49:55] falldrgn: whats an O line? Please don't ask the falcons..
[2:50:05] jacooners: if the bills win ima lose my shit

[2:50:55] Thunderbrew: @Cabbageman007 The one that losses.
[2:50:56] elbinn: think rodgers is coming back to GB or gonna do a brady and try to find a super bowl ready team?
[2:51:00] haunt_r: my mothe rin law is the bengals head coach
[2:51:04] Holysal: yeah hes 38
[2:51:14] Broomba: for the argent tournament mounts -- if u are alliance, you cant buy the horde mounts?
[2:51:14] K9kal: Play calling didn't help the oline or Burrow either though. If your oline is struggling like need to call more screens and quick passes to the slot. Bengals kept sending 3 Wr's downfield every play.
[2:51:24] Ldysansa: Isn't there a viewer of yours that is an NFL player?
[2:51:25] DrWraithjr: Rodgers has no loyalty to anyone other than himself, he is gone
[2:51:57] mavericks312: yea Bengals calling deep passing routes while the line couldn't hold up was stupid
[2:52:01] Donswag3: I heard Pat McAfee watches your streams too
[2:52:06] Niksen_99: Which NFL team is the biggest of all time ?
[2:52:11] Phobion: @towelliee  what is the story behind you changing from dwarf to tauren?
[2:52:12] Dracarys_021: noooooo
[2:52:20] jacooners: the average nfl career is 3.3 years
[2:52:21] Thunderbrew: Lula is best
[2:52:21] Voodoochild77: @Towelliee My defensive end coach in high school played on the D line for Chicago in the early 90's
[2:52:22] QuigsTV: @Towelliee I went to high school with someone who plays on the Arizona Cardinals. Hes a bench player
[2:52:23] lekkahdh: No way?
[2:52:24] LoseAlotLuke: shes just better, get better Kappa
[2:52:26] JQ47: what's the drop %?
[2:52:28] piratechris: Toewlliee the slacker LUL
[2:52:28] zilzihan: Did 5k+ attempts on the infinite timereaver
[2:52:29] lalelusa: Lula deserves good things!
[2:52:30] DragonofWolves: don't be jealous towelliee
[2:52:35] K9kal: Tyler Boyd in the slot was barely involved in that game when he should've gotten peppered with targets to keep the pass rush at bay.
[2:52:35] elbinn: @K9kal yeah all first half they were looking for the deep ball they rely on with chase and then Q3 they adapted to quick throws but went right back to deep balls. Zac Taylor is either great or awful with calls
[2:52:36] salsaboyirl: cow is meta race
[2:52:39] smashwow: oh you're waaaay more than 18 attempts in towelliee. that's just this event Kappa
[2:52:39] BiggTC: @JQ47 1/4000
[2:52:50] magemaster225: timereaver into love rocket marathons?

[2:53:10] srze94: DoTs are good on him
[2:53:12] Armdel: i got it from like the first black temple time walking
[2:53:12] zilzihan: Still so sad they changed the name and icon of the big love rocket
[2:53:13] mavericks312: @k9kal I agree but they kept trying deep corner routes and post routes
[2:53:13] Snabido: You didnt commit hard enough Keepo
[2:53:14] lekkahdh: You got those claw hand thingy mounts? :O Those are awesome I really need to get one
[2:53:16] kyr_slowbro: nice pyromancer impression - "for nothing..."
[2:53:22] TazzTheGrimreapper: the drop rate for the Timereaver is about .001% droprate
[2:53:22] lin_skinn: Kirilenko an old player for the utah jazz played WOW so much he got a giant pally tatoo

[2:53:50] K9kal: @elbinn I agree. It was like Taylor was trying to get Burrow killed lol
[2:53:50] ThisIzD: i got this mount in like my 4th time walking and a guy in my group about died because he had ran like 300 and still had not got it.
[2:53:52] Wrizzik: I never got Love Rocket, but I got Timereaver after about 2-3 yrs of casual timewalking

[3:15:55] ToxicJeffs: Does this drop from every time walking boss
[3:16:00] Frenaris: those are rookie numbers, you gotta pump those numbers up!
[3:16:04] Thunderbrew: Does the stream end on the drop of the Mount?
[3:16:11] jerexify: @Towelliee Just have Lula come and run a couple on your character. You'll have it in no time.
[3:16:29] Eggz1004: @Thunderbrew no he is doing islands afterwards
[3:16:35] SargeAF: last boss of the dungeon is its drop %. Funny is I got it off the timewalking dungeon that has the dragon in it.

[3:17:32] StealthySpork: I remember getting this mount and not realizing that the drop was so low....lets just say the people i grouped with were very annoyed lol
[3:17:41] parmesanchi: On different time zones
[3:17:41] Daikanatv: to reserve for someone else
[3:17:42] xo_navi: means they specifically have to manually refresh names
[3:17:44] Vile_: It means you can't reserve names on a dummy character.
[3:17:46] csSloth: it means if you delete a character the name is gone forever
[3:17:46] Kisswani: I think it means , dont have someone try to reserve your name for you
[3:17:48] honkblarg: means you cant hold a name for a friend
[3:17:58] 91Niki: @Towelliee Delete it to reserve it so you can customize the character without rushing to the end. I think
[3:18:21] SpoofAvatar: scroll down in the post there is an example
[3:18:29] parmesanchi: 120
[3:18:34] SauceFu: Scrool down, they say the names don't auto release, it's manual
[3:18:43] N3llee: that post says its a manual process
[3:18:51] SpoofAvatar: keep going
[3:18:52] BardtheBowman: boo

[3:19:10] Pey0: Good Morning T
[3:19:11] SauceFu: yup, manual refresh is only way the names get released if a character is deleted
[3:19:17] Alienfromger: no big deal tbh
[3:19:24] charizard_main: Make those names count everyone

[3:21:16] idenkaz_: i had that mount in my inventory for 2 weeks before i saw it. i remember ppl saying gratz in chat not knowing it was for me KEKW
[3:21:17] Balkep: infinite time reaver is the most bs mount, I spent so many hours trying to get it, ran hundreds of runs, saw it drop twice, but not for me :(
[3:21:21] Tossinit: Think lost ark will stay popular for awhile chat?
[3:21:24] mandilozano: @plague_seraph true, i thought he had it already since he got the sha mount which is harder
[3:21:35] LeideGaming: at what level can i get the mount? 50-60 or just 60???
[3:21:38] Niksen_99: It looks like a swift nether drake right ?

[4:23:27] Thoreya: LUL
[4:23:30] nihilistic_bat: KEKW
[4:23:30] thiccsushi: What's wrong with BF 2042? I haven't played that shit since BF 3
[4:23:33] xo_navi: LUL
[4:23:34] Digitalspork: @Poriand since at minimum 2019 from what CEO said
[4:23:34] Shrenko: they are ignoring the playerbase too
[4:23:34] LilPe: it costs to play bf2042?
[4:23:42] thenormalbeast: and battlefield 1, and battlefield 4 in terms of player count
[4:23:43] Mecabeast: im a bit excited for an outriders expansion
[4:23:49] galidarr: they should probably stop releasing stuff before it is ready
[4:23:50] chainschall: I don't understand how F2P would help.  The game is just ok at best
[4:23:54] xo_navi: It is an okay game but lots of issues
[4:23:58] kokochris: yup they straight up blew 2042
[4:24:02] xo_navi: and devs are bad
[4:24:11] c0mmander_starscream: The flying Hovercraft taking out jets is still the meta in 2042
[4:24:20] bgriff87: Pretty much all the devs who worked on BF3 and 4 were long gone.

[4:24:46] Shrenko: it is a new dev team @Towelliee the old devs left a while ago, you can clearly see that with the new BF2042
[4:24:48] iitsmadness: compared to other betas i've played bf2042 felt more like an alpha with all the bugs it had.
[4:24:50] After43ver: force of habit
[4:24:59] Noobpownin09: population in 2042 is in the 5k range on PC
[4:25:02] MT__Chair: Too many games try to do too much.  BF wow retail and others are great examples.  Devs gotta go back to keeping it simple.
[4:25:03] BubbaChubbs420: the maps were kinda shitty and there was not enough guns in BF42
[4:25:04] Reddevc: imagine being handed the IP of BF 1942, 2, 3, and 4... then pumping out the hot fucking garbage of the last few releases
[4:25:06] Qeevdo: It does no damage anymore tho
[4:25:10] Balkep: the publisher wants the game to be the game a certain way - "time to change the devs" LUL this logic
[4:25:13] c0mmander_starscream: EA had 5 different studios working on 2042 thats why its in the state its in
[4:25:35] Shrenko: it is Dice, but with new devs
[4:25:36] kokochris: the whole team failed.  from director, product owners, qa, devs.  they straight up blew it
[4:25:44] Shrenko: its like Blizzard, most old devs left
[4:25:46] thenormalbeast: Dice with new devs, a few leadership is still there
[4:25:57] Ezekyler: there was a time when Towelliee respected boss mechanics towCry
[4:25:58] BrutalHermit: every single person who pre-ordered that garbage got exactly what they deserve LUL
[4:25:58] c0mmander_starscream: its not the same devs that made BF 4
[4:26:06] swordart_19: Just met surv hunt named Yearofspear KEKW
[4:26:09] jmalmin: Dice have been strange over the last years... they had issues with battlefront 2 as well. at least they fixed that game.

[5:30:29] DecayedmiNt: It was horrible for Druid even.

[5:31:38] Aro725: I really wish they would just rework the classes we have, new talents, new abilities things like that. I feel like theyre going to try and do too much like SL and fail again
[5:31:39] jasperboy: @Kisswani Dont hate on the wheelchair spec man Pepehand
[5:31:42] PvtHudson093: @Kisswani Why you got to do me like that

[5:32:11] grandmatb: cloth tanks lel
[5:32:13] darkdestroz: thats becouse warlocks were tanky in legion,

[5:32:16] ElDrakenMan: no mage tank spec? LUL
[5:32:16] Surefirexp: Add a whitcher class lol

[5:32:34] OhNoNotAgain: Bouncing around, lot of them dead atm
[5:32:40] CardinalTX: Give it the FF treatment.....1 character can learn any/every class spec
[5:32:48] jeffnsteff2019: i can see them do a spec themed around khadgar for mages like time mages
[5:32:49] Urebaldd: A spec like the diablo demon hunter would be cool
[5:32:52] DragonofWolves: well I mean technically warlocks were tanky in vanilla. voidwalker
[5:32:57] Aidler: every spec gets two specializations Kappa
[5:32:59] mikejames01: nope not for wow
[5:33:00] captivate7: i like the diversity in wow
[5:33:05] Trotteri23: FF14 job style doesnt sell character boosts

[5:33:10] TheGaoSora: Heresy D:
[5:33:14] ArthurianNZ: Melee priest?
[5:33:25] DecayedmiNt: The WoW playerbase would complain about having to switch jobs mid tier

[5:35:16] Archiee: or just give us a decent xpac
[5:35:17] piratechris: Why do we want every class to be able to fill all roles? I don't want that. I'd take a new talen instead.
[5:35:19] PvtHudson093: Divine Toll better by in that new talent row
[5:35:23] s_w_a_y_y: how about going back to be able to combine spec's together
[5:35:24] Urebaldd: Just let us play titans

[5:35:27] CardinalTX: A Warlock that enjoys canning.  Picklemancer

[5:36:11] lithium364: like thanos PogChamp
[5:36:17] ArcaneSyntax: 3 best covenant abilities anyway
[5:36:18] TheUnknowing: make blessed hammer baseline and replace its talent with divine toll, ez

[5:36:20] pereadin: I actually wouldn't mind Divine Toll as base for H Pal
[5:36:24] BardtheBowman: abombination limb for DK,
[5:36:29] balanira: i cannot imagine playing dk without slappy hands anymore
[5:36:29] SavanThe7: I think more so for Hpala than Prot or Ret.
[5:36:29] KurumTV: Ashen Hallow baseline would be nice Kappa
[5:36:32] dugarg_: I think that they should add the most unique ability of the previous expansion as a spell every new expansion
[5:36:35] average_j4y: average_j4y subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 12 months, currently on a 1 month streak! 
[5:36:38] malesmurd: eso has manual attribute selection, it isnt that impactful but it's another way to give agency to a player

[5:37:01] Melria: I think phoenix flame got added after legion.
[5:37:02] DragonofWolves: if they had the venthyr teleport ability become a talent for mages for example, I'd love that
[5:37:11] pereadin: Instead of Avenging Crusader they put in Ashen Hallow @Towelliee KEKW

[5:37:12] jetributions: druid convoke
[5:37:19] Arthur_eld: I could see condemn becoming a talent for warriors
[5:37:26] BardtheBowman: convoke is a lot of fun
[5:37:29] Acoustic: convoke chaos bolts
[5:37:32] UltiCarnagee: Put Convoke in the Same row as Incarn, or Soul of the Forrest
[5:37:37] Templexx: yea they really are cool
[5:37:39] swordart_19: was :P
[5:37:43] Okri24: Just make Paladins open to more races as they made a Priest into a Paladin in Legion.....
[5:37:51] ThorH13: ThorH13 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 112 months, currently on a 112 month streak! 
[5:37:52] KurumTV: Just look at how Stormkeeper became a talent in BFA, it's the only talent picked in that row the entire time it has been in the game
[5:37:53] Milanesa_De_Pollo: 9.1 felt like the real release of Shadowlands
[5:37:56] darkdestroz: okay im confused is there comming a new xpac or a new patch??
[5:37:58] wEiRdO_dUdE: Yeah, the covenant abilities are alright it was just a matter of tuning
[5:38:16] NuAera: convoke is just iconic to druids now, great fantasy
[5:38:18] Nerendis: What is the attached photo the pastebin was talking about?
[5:38:24] DragonofWolves: well yeah towelliee I know you'd want the ardent defender talent for paladins from the bastion covenant
[5:38:28] zilvera1: 112 months? That's like 9 1/3 years
[5:38:29] swordart_19: ashen is ResidentSleeper imo
[5:38:33] ElDrakenMan: wait is this now a 24 hour stream?
[5:38:36] Shiekrunner: hey
[5:38:38] Shiekrunner: all
[5:39:08] Drayus_: what's going in the smoker?
[5:39:14] moa285: DH The hunt POGGERS
[5:39:21] pereadin: 100%
[5:39:21] Drayus_: hmmmmmmmm
[5:39:23] Kisswani: NIght Fae warlock would like a word Kappa
[5:39:24] balanira: slappy hands for DK
[5:39:26] Urebaldd: I'm so used to using the covenant ability in my rotation I would kinda miss it
[5:39:32] Drayus_: delicious
[5:39:34] campingking615: I just logged on to the hammer squad guild it is dead
[5:39:38] DragonofWolves: well if it says anything I'm about another 2 years from 100 months PokPikachu
[5:39:45] ArthurianNZ: with that dragonsworn/new class/race thing - did it say if it was a "HERO" class? Ie start at 50 or something?
[5:39:49] FluffyDooom: They tend to water down abillities if they use them as talents/actuall abillities in a following expansion tho. I'd imagine convoke would use 1 abillity from each specialization or something weird
[5:39:54] Snabido: Slappy hands for dps dks if they wont give us gorefiend's grasp 👀
[5:40:07] Secilla90: !leaks
[5:40:08] Moobot: @secilla90 WHELP https://www.mmo-champion.com/threads/2613260-10-0-Return-of-the-Dragon-Isles-Leak?p=53548615#post53548615 | https://www.twitch.tv/videos/1265637373 | https://www.mmo-champion.com/threads/2613424-The-dreaming-expansion?p=53551825#post53551825
[5:40:09] happybooger: more DOTS!
[5:40:15] TheGaoSora: what have you done LUL
[5:40:27] DragonofWolves: the dragonsworn class sounds like a hero class tbh
[5:40:36] futomara01: i missed the timereaver?
[5:40:44] WestonTeli: did you get the timereaver or are you taking a break
[5:40:52] Sielu11628: Someone on mmo-c thread asked "Towelliee if you are reading this, tell us more about 10.0 being different" lol
[5:41:06] Milanesa_De_Pollo: Dragonsworn seems so random

[5:41:15] Celestia6: warden for sure
[5:41:16] sixfreed: Bladesmaster.
[5:41:18] ArthurianNZ: Dark Ranger or wardens
[5:41:19] lithium364: probably because lorewise you would have been another class before you become an dragonsworn?
[5:41:20] ditaern: Tinker
[5:41:25] BlindFaithFuel: I just want to be a DH and not a weekling BE lol
[5:41:25] signeddudu: tinker, blademaster...
[5:41:26] balanira: honestly there is 0 difference past the starting zone for normal/hero class
[5:41:28] ClipCraft: tinker
[5:41:29] Semmspiral: Whatever a new class might be, please let it have a ranged spec
[5:41:36] sorrel_n: I mean the only classes that aren't really additional specs to already existing classes are Tinker and Necromancer
[5:41:36] Kisswani: Man , there will be riots if the next expansion is not Dragon Isles KEKW
[5:41:39] Okri24: Make Peon a class
[5:41:39] Melria: shadow hunter
[5:41:42] Okri24: Zug zug
[5:41:45] Milanesa_De_Pollo: blademaster, warden, dark ranger just don't have enough to be their own class
[5:41:46] nxtlolz: murloc
[5:41:48] DragonofWolves: now what would be even more badass is if the dragonsworn had a racial that let your flying mount be a dragon.. like you'd shapeshift into one
[5:41:49] SnoWeazel: timeweaver
[5:41:51] mandilozano: peon class
[5:41:52] Andalaidor: dragon knights
[5:41:54] haugexxx: When do you expect announcements?
[5:41:54] Milanesa_De_Pollo: Tinker is that last archatype WoW is missing
[5:41:57] piratechris: Dragon knights?
[5:42:01] UltiCarnagee: Dragoon PogChamp
[5:42:11] lithium364: hydalin class?
[5:42:11] moa285: @UltiCarnagee LULW
[5:42:13] Aelissia: Dragonsworn seems most likely.
[5:42:13] lithium364: xD
[5:42:15] Nerendis: Just make the expansion not dragon based 4Head
[5:42:17] Jokervenom1978: DRAGON BARD!!
[5:42:17] signeddudu: Just please, let it be ranged
[5:42:17] fluffk1n: Sorcerer?
[5:42:20] ArthurianNZ: some of those couldve also been the 4th spec tbh
[5:42:27] phinoxrgp: oh no plz
[5:42:29] Sielu11628: Straight up new race: Dragon Aspect
[5:42:30] phinoxrgp: no tinklet
[5:42:30] ClipCraft: i think tinker would be lit
[5:42:30] lithium364: warrior of light
[5:42:33] phinoxrgp: fuck that
[5:42:35] KurumTV: Tinker could both be a Ranged DPS and a Healer, so far no new class has been ranged, and only 1 has been healer
[5:42:37] lithium364: fighting against despair
[5:42:37] sixfreed: I would reroll my paladin into a tinker.
[5:42:40] Shiekrunner: i just want to be wrathion turning into a dragon n shit
[5:42:47] balanira: imagine tinker class as gmod mounting gmod Pog
[5:42:49] wEiRdO_dUdE: Bears can't full moon anymore lol
[5:42:50] Nerendis: I think Dragons is the worst lore they could possibly come up with
[5:43:03] havenbirch: Dragonsworn seems to make the most sense for Dragon Isles
[5:43:06] Breakthecause: @HickoryLIVE I disagree. It fits the classic fantasy and that's what I want
[5:43:20] popik28: hey r u playing Rdruid ?
[5:43:22] Taylormade2711: new class is a easy way to get hype for new expac for sure
[5:43:24] lithium364: tinker would have alot of potential like druids where every Mech form is different for each tinker race
[5:43:25] Iver_monk: And in game
[5:43:25] Freethenukes: a Forge or Nature Cleric would be a tank in the D&D universe, so a priest tank would be a far stretch to have.
[5:43:32] Nerendis: @Breakthecause go watch game of thrones
[5:43:34] moa285: Full moon was removed for PvP, right?
[5:43:41] Breakthecause: @HickoryLIVE Never seen it
[5:43:53] Metket: did he got the mount? tw ?

[5:44:07] balanira: tauren tinker LUL
[5:44:07] rivera9: yweah make it DH, RACE loceked
[5:44:09] AvrithSATX: I just want my Gnome Paladin or Shaman.
[5:44:10] havenbirch: What would you prefer, a Draconic race or a Draconic class? Maybe both?
[5:44:18] lithium364: Iron Horde TInker PogChamp
[5:44:21] Okri24: Goblin Tinker is like the Gmod mount
[5:44:25] parmesanchi: Faction Specific Class Pog
[5:44:36] Okri24: and Gnomes are just tidy-er
[5:44:37] Nerendis: All New World Xmas items are free in the shop RN @Towelliee
[5:44:44] Caloz7: maybe after race
[5:44:49] Kritex: @HickoryLIVE ded game
[5:45:04] moa285: Gnome Druid - Travel Forms - Rat, Butterfly,.. Kappa

[5:45:11] jeffnsteff2019: Make trinkers like mech suits throw bombs and missiles and have shields for tanks
[5:45:22] havenbirch: I think they could announce 10.0 without spoiling the end of SL Story
[5:45:27] ArthurianNZ: oh god - imagine if they announced it April 1st....
[5:45:43] Milanesa_De_Pollo: Don't they need like 6+ months of alpha/beta?
[5:45:46] SnoWeazel: draenei makes great sence as tinker tho, they smart as fuck and have a spaceship
[5:46:12] BardtheBowman: or if major characters are dead
[5:46:15] Kritex: They should just do Fortnite tactic, and turn the map upside down lmao
[5:46:23] Nerendis: I really want the jailer to win, I'm tired of us bitches winning. We need to get kicked down a few pegs
[5:46:23] youzeon: Well you said 10.0 is VERY different right?
[5:46:34] joontet: There is 0% chance for 10.0 annoucement before the end of SL
[5:46:52] bgriff87: MoP was pretty long wasnt it?
[5:46:55] Kritex: It got extended multiple times remember
[5:46:55] relios898: I think maybe 9.2 date this week
[5:46:59] sonicserpent09: 10.0 wow2 lol
[5:47:07] lithium364: they also might give "Free Beta" for D4 Preorder like they did with mop?
[5:47:16] jeffnsteff2019: legion was grade A meat
[5:47:22] DragonofWolves: @breakthecause I don't see what GoT has to do with dragon lore in classic. GoT came years ago
[5:47:26] sitmeee: Im just hyped for when they release Shadowlands classic
[5:47:29] itsTwigs_: Can the Jailer even die
[5:47:52] Morphlink: jailer dead and sylvanas becomes the new shadowlands boss
[5:47:53] Breezy_467: Gonna kill the Jailer at minimum 3 times like KT
[5:48:02] Aidler: the jailer is dead
[5:48:05] Milanesa_De_Pollo: Sylvanas isn't
[5:48:08] iitsmadness: the first ones arent apparently
[5:48:09] af2kk: is bobby killable?
[5:48:19] Ponkan92: Not sylvanas xD
[5:48:23] Kritex: My thing is where are all these people "dieing" to, wouldnt they just be brought right back to Shadowlands
[5:48:26] FluffyDooom: Kael'Thas wants a word with you :P
[5:48:45] ToastLamoan: Dragon Isles baby! Green dragon friends
[5:48:49] Davedaman26: what if the Jailer pulls a Thanos and eliminate half the universe
[5:49:03] Kritex: @Davedaman26 that would be kind of cool
[5:49:03] Kisswani: Just have it be like the lich king cinematic in Dalaran or something
[5:49:04] OnyxLair77: Does Lula have a good chicken wing recipe?
[5:49:07] notemneiher: did he get it?
[5:49:09] NoSelfJustice: jailer does the whole click
[5:49:16] moa285: Kappa
[5:49:16] Breakthecause: @dragonofwolves I didn't meantion GoT, Hickory did
[5:49:26] Archiee: Pullin a Thanos
[5:49:28] sitmeee: lol
[5:49:31] Toon11: only the gnomes, no one will miss them
[5:49:32] rhino_u: snaps his fingers and the occulus is gone
[5:49:32] Milanesa_De_Pollo: Worst thing that has happened so far. PepeLaugh
[5:49:36] TMMOOF: Cata 2.0 LUL
[5:49:38] rivera9: can we make shadowlands disapear plz
[5:49:39] smokingcactus: aslong as hogger gets to stay with us i am cool with it
[5:49:39] AmericanFat: no groups found? damn dead server
[5:49:41] flebbooo: I really liked that idea of a Class that has 4 specs based of the dragon aspects, tho Dragonsworn idk about that KEKW
[5:49:42] Davedaman26: if they run out of ideas
[5:49:47] SnoWeazel: snaps fingers: "you motherfuckers live on dreanor now
[5:49:47] sitmeee: then we could have an expack to bring them all back
[5:49:53] AvrithSATX: It's ok. We'll avenge them. ...after looting the dust-piles of the half that are gone.
[5:49:54] Epiclawlzable: we would just need to put together of like minded heroes to pull a time heist and go back and undo the jailer snap
[5:49:55] WestonTeli: timeless isle
[5:50:00] Morphlink: tehn u need to call the Dr. strange aka Dr Boom :D
[5:50:02] Bwyllin_: I'd love the dragon one tbh
[5:50:04] jmn115: @Towelliee imagine if that happened and you logged in and some of your toons were Stright gone
[5:50:05] mateolaa: Should have aimed for the head
[5:50:15] sorrel_n: Kind of think they'll let us start 10.0 testing early and we'll have a long beta period just to boost subscriptions. 9.2 is good but isn't going to bring many back
[5:50:15] Aidler: I think the jailer will be banned or jailed again upon defeat but not killed
[5:50:19] lithium364: 50/50 the dragon isles are flying themselves
[5:50:19] FluffyDooom: Saw eternals the other day...  my brain kept drawing connections to different events in wow :D
[5:50:25] ToastLamoan: the dragon isles will exist within a dragon, the whole expansion we are inside of a giant dragon......
[5:50:25] Kritex: Khadgar could lead us there lol
[5:50:40] DragonofWolves: I love how there are so many Thanos memes it's insanity
[5:50:42] Aelissia: I hope it's dragon isles. That would bring me back to the game for sure.
[5:50:56] Kisswani: Terraforming Azeroth POGGERS
[5:50:56] ToastLamoan: World of Warcraft: The Meta
[5:51:02] Bromgarr: Khadgar kinda dr strange vibes
[5:51:07] OnyxLair77: Oh so the movie Wally
[5:51:10] Drayus_: azeroth: what happened? skyrim npc: you're finally awake
[5:51:17] spekktrum19: If it is Dragon Isles, we gotta get the Nozdormu -> Murazond transformation
[5:51:20] Thoreya: i remember dragon isles rumors back in like fucking BC discussion forums lol
[5:51:23] Reddevc: BOOBA straza
[5:51:25] AmericanFat: @Aelissia well the only thing that could out-shadow dragon islands is Void Lord expansion
[5:51:25] Thoreya: would not be surprised at all
[5:51:31] iblighters: I'd love if the Dragon Isles we're floating islands that are designed with flying in mind and we can fly day one.
[5:51:35] NoSelfJustice: knowing our luck, it will be World Of Warcraft - Shadowlands 2.0
[5:51:35] ArthurianNZ: Do you think that 9.3 wouldve been a full campaign of Arthas and then with Zovaal the boss in THAT raid? I kinda feel that bailing early means losing an Arthas storyline
[5:51:58] DeanoTV: old gods 10.2/3
[5:51:59] GnarlyNITEMARE: As long as Jaina and Thrall dont make the bridges there we will be ok
[5:52:02] Kisswani: I'm fine with both of these things
[5:52:15] TheUnknowing: the shadowlands was a simulation!
[5:52:25] lithium364: @Towelliee Wrathion got an Human/Dragon Hybrid model recently in Hearthstone
[5:52:37] spekktrum19: Rumor of 5th old god not yet revealed
[5:52:39] NoSelfJustice: i want jaina to love my toon :D
[5:52:41] balanira: they shouldve done full old god expansion man ... being in black empire zone wouldve been so cool
[5:52:44] Davedaman26: @Towelliee what if they do like what happened in the Eternals and the Titan is stopped before the world of Azeroth is fully awaken
[5:52:44] sorrel_n: Welcome to lfr lol
[5:52:46] sitmeee: lol
[5:52:55] sitmeee: LFR is an adventure
[5:53:00] Holb__: You doing Hordes only for Wartusk right now?
[5:53:04] sitmeee: and funny
[5:53:10] AmericanFat: D:
[5:53:11] Bartholomew_521: facts
[5:53:17] sorrel_n: LFR: Where the players are the content
[5:53:26] Kisswani: special cohhDerp danDerp slootDerp
[5:53:28] havenbirch: Think we'll remove Sargeras' sword next expac?
[5:53:28] ArthurianNZ: I did an lfr recently - wiped 10s, only pulled boss accidently twice
[5:53:32] onous_: Theyre touched not special.
[5:53:46] Holb__: Okay was just asking, Id keep my eyes open for groups if so
[5:53:47] wreaveit: timewaster done?
[5:54:07] Webby4u: what are your objectives in the 24 hours?
[5:54:14] McLovinYoMuffin: @towelliee I’m really disappointed with the blame shifting narrative with afrasabi. Where was Ion in all of this?  If they try to spin 10.0 as “now” Daneuser can shine it’s just pathetic. Goes to show that the dev team lacks professionalism and ownership in their work.
[5:54:24] Exodeo_: I think rarity isn't reporting the new dungeons
[5:54:28] Exodeo_: I've got the same issue
[5:54:29] Shiekrunner: wayyy more like +15 xd
[5:54:30] N3llee: Man sometimes the internet just breaks you down
[5:54:43] drinkmorewaterhahaha: @Towelliee  how many characters do you have at level 50-60 ?
[5:54:47] wEiRdO_dUdE: LUL
[5:54:48] theDirtyon3: your wrong my man
[5:54:56] theDirtyon3: @McLovinYoMuffin
[5:55:02] mandilozano: there was a hearhstone expansion where each class would had their own dragon hero card, maybe they will do something similar
[5:55:05] N3llee: @Towelliee have you seen this Merrel Lynch exec story trending on the net over the smoothie?
[5:55:10] Aidler: how many of the 4000 attempts can you do in 24h?
[5:55:29] at1c: you cant do 180
[5:55:43] smashwow: let's just hope we get a better story in the future. if it's more of the same meh
[5:55:43] Aidler: ooff
[5:55:45] Oldguvner: Go Bucks
[5:55:52] darexyy: Do you think the merge will affect the quality of the next xpac? @Towelliee
[5:56:01] cinnamints: Yep, people weren't thinking about lead time when they started wailing about Danuser.
[5:56:14] Merex760: Narrative isn't even the biggest issue with the last couple expansions anyway. It's the systems
[5:56:25] cipusanx: but the story telling sucks man. this is the problem of shadowlands and of the current story team. they did a shit job
[5:56:40] frassin: frassin subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 90 months! 
[5:56:48] Discmain: so when are we getting liquid hammer dude

[5:57:10] mikejames01: if ya can do a better story go work for blizz then
[5:57:10] jeffnsteff2019: wouldnt mind a 9 month testing for 10.0
[5:57:15] happybooger: @Towelliee did you buy the mounts from the Deaths Advance vendor after completing the On the Offensive achievement?

[5:57:35] dewking93: isnt team liquid from halo 3 days?
[5:58:02] brokenjester: the people writing the books
[5:58:06] cinnamints: I can't wait for Liquid Eggs over Azeroth! (And I understand they might not call the morning show that :D )
[5:58:07] DecayedmiNt: @dewking93 Starcraft
[5:58:11] Ordicos: just think of what people would said if legion the sword gets stabbed into the world then they just skip all of bfa onto something else
[5:58:24] Arceptor: they use hollywood quality tools to make the cinematics and in game renders
[5:58:25] Kisswani: I think Terran mentioned that it was like 2.5 years before the sargeras cinematic that they started working on it
[5:59:05] lastdeo: Bill Gates says

[5:59:20] Akoudadis: Basically Anthem :P
[5:59:23] sorrel_n: Plus even if the new guy disagrees with the story direction they inherited they still have to hype it up
[5:59:35] RiptoreCA: I mean, there are a lot of things I am sure that get axed mid production. Just like so many games they ditch millions into it.
[5:59:58] dyslexican1: @Towelliee im not saying its right, but the movie industry does exactly that all the time to CGI companies.
[5:59:58] Aidler: "and in these 7 month we might change it again"

[6:03:03] VStheStream: What has the cinematic team been working on? Not talking the in game cinematic teams but the CG scenes we had one every other month during BFA it seemed.
[6:03:55] Vivelli: you wouldnt know because its about the story that hasnt been released yet?
[6:03:57] Kisswani: @VStheStream working from home probably hit him hard .I dont think they had full access to their equipment
[6:05:30] VStheStream: I wonder if they are just busy doing stuff on D4
[6:07:19] Spookyboogy1: I think it puts us in a bad spot because at this point Sylvanus has done everything that Arthas has besides slaying her family members. She is now in canon recognized as top tier evil as far as actions go and should not be forgiven and it kinda sucks neutering Tyrande on some peace and love BS when she is 1000% justified for revenge/justice.
[6:07:24] Theduskflyer: hey got it? 24 hour steam over? lol

[6:08:47] Sielu11628: @vsthestream In an interview with Danuser at the end of BFA, he said that the stories in BFA were told on cinematics to tell a certain story. They said it wouldn’t necessarily be like that again for SL
[6:08:48] officialviz: Yeah like where tf is Khadgar

[6:16:34] cakepickle: Playing a blizzard game in support of mental health. Is that ironic or appropiate.... cant tell

[6:33:09] MemezTV: no certain classes prob
[6:33:11] Thoreya: WoW will benefit the most from the acquisition than any other blizzard game
[6:33:13] CrusaderNero: oh no, more responsibility on each player. toxic for pugging
[6:33:14] MemezTV: no certain specs
[6:33:16] Broomba: taco bell went through 3 changes since 2010 -- more than blizz and wow
[6:33:18] thenormalbeast: Yea, blizzard would need a new build of the game just for this
[6:33:20] xFevers: @Woddell look up "WoW's Health: The Numbers Don't Lie... Here's What We Discovered." by Bellular on YT
[6:33:20] zoovthepally: well that's less exciting but still cool
[6:33:24] Theduskflyer: did you do a before on timewarp badges to see how many you have once you get the mount?
[6:33:43] showmethesugar35: Fuck, please dont do wow more esports as it is
[6:33:52] CrusaderNero: no pls dont wow esports anymore
[6:33:54] FranciscoTheMage: pfft bellular

[6:35:11] Thoreya: WoW will benefit the most from the acquisition than any other blizzard game
[6:35:32] bonkyouded: no legendaries
[6:35:40] sorrel_n: Ya but China government cracking down on gaming probably isn't helping WoW numbers
[6:35:48] MarshLo: Tarra with no anima powers
[6:35:51] Lockrocker: Well that's odd. China is so free on giving out information
[6:36:04] GamerKillance: china banned all new games from being released with brand new censorship laws on current games. china numbers are going away. diablo immortal wont release since its no longer allowed to be made for china
[6:36:17] wreaveit: doing all bosses without venth palas
[6:36:17] propoopimus: except people in china
[6:36:19] GamerKillance: No more new games in china allowed
[6:36:19] Merex760: Aren't China WoW subs bought by the hour or something?
[6:36:22] futomara01: wow is for boomers
[6:36:22] Draz3nx: china doesn't pay a monthly sub its hourly

[6:38:32] FranciscoTheMage: Blizzard KNOWS this and its important for them to cultivate a new group of players. @Towelliee
[6:38:33] AesirGaming: Played wow for 18 years lol

[6:38:48] mandilozano: @zikjh 69
[6:38:49] Aidler: limitations in China are for sub 18 people. china also gave no new licenses for games in the past 6 - 8 month but that doesn't affect WoW
[6:39:08] thorined: no offense towelie but your stream is just a asmongold waiting  room for me LUL
[6:39:14] JackHealMe: Pretty cool event Liquid and Echo are doing!  https://twitter.com/liquidguild/status/1485326756219293696?s=20
[6:39:18] GamerKillance: Ya current games are still allowed for now. they did get hit with a massive censorship hammer though
[6:39:37] thenormalbeast: They need to teach mechanics better
[6:39:47] MarshLo: I dcd Im coming back
[6:39:53] Gingerprimer: @Aidler yeah from what I havve heard ppl just use their parents id for games and stuff

[6:40:09] mandilozano: EZ dodge
[6:40:10] GamerKillance: Look at the trial for ff14. Its well over 100 hours of content if not more
[6:40:12] TMMOOF: 20 with a cap of 60 is better than 20 with a cap of 120 tho
[6:40:14] Abdielo: sweet
[6:40:14] JackHealMe: towHAMUP towHAMUP towHAMUP
[6:40:19] darkdestroz: yeh how about making the trial like Final fantasys trial

[6:40:25] DiabeticNJ: lool
[6:40:33] FranciscoTheMage: the same Xmas graphic
[6:40:35] Bewbacca: when i hit lvl 20 on a trial toon i just farmed dungeon finder for the best gear because what else could i do
[6:40:37] Allemongo: @rivera9 SWTORs free to play is one of the worst in the market
[6:40:40] adrenerjik: Any plans to stream the new world patch coming up?
[6:40:43] mandilozano: barrier to entry is 45 bucks LUL
[6:40:48] Merex760: WoW should be free outside of the current expansion
[6:40:56] Aidler: @gingerprimer but if you get caught it affects your social credit score and that is very serious in China
[6:40:58] FranciscoTheMage: is that what it costs to start today? 45?
[6:41:00] sorrel_n: Need low level raids to train new players
[6:41:08] FAINTJ0EY: I feel bad for new player who pick a rogue to level first. That class while leveling is very sluggish
[6:41:21] tomcruise210: @sorrel_n yea something would be nice
[6:41:27] orbiitz269: holy shit i forgot about this boss
[6:41:27] Moobot: towHAMUP TOWELLIEE GOT A NEW ORIGIN GAMING PC! | https://bit.ly/35GOQIN towSO |Specs https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/414625240233148419/857136797167779860/orringpc.png | Towelliee Gaming is proud to be sponsored by ORIGIN PC!

[6:42:03] Heyhowsitgoingtonight: infinite timewaster
[6:42:03] Allemongo: @FAINTJ0EY just leveled a rogue alt, couldn't agree more. DPS was awful until 40S lul
[6:42:06] mmo_kenna_: DM Ecks
[6:42:11] sarbapowa: how rare is infinite timereaver
[6:42:14] Rottencoarse: @Towelliee  u need to say with the raspy voice tho
[6:42:20] balanira: there is literally 0 chance you can convice people in random timewalking queue to do this boss LUL
[6:42:25] weirdsp4ce: rip
[6:42:27] mandilozano: @FranciscoTheMage well base edition is 39.99 with a free month, after that is 15 bucks
[6:42:33] JackHealMe: LUL
[6:42:35] FAINTJ0EY: @Allemongo yeah its honestly terrible
[6:42:42] Heyhowsitgoingtonight: just hit the vape
[6:42:43] Rottencoarse: @Towelliee  LUL LUL
[6:42:49] thashm: the thing is before 60 you never have to grind rep , honor , items , the tower , ... what makes alot of newer players quit imo
[6:42:52] mandilozano: @FranciscoTheMage so its 55 for two months
[6:43:12] Gillyman333: can xbox handle wow?
[6:43:16] Allemongo: @FAINTJ0EY they are the most squishy class as well. take so much damage and has zero 1 defensive and 1 heal
[6:43:16] Jigawatts42: so towelliee, what do you think the cross faction and/or removal of the faction divide is actually going to be in practice?
[6:43:31] pilltillkill: @Gillyman333 Kappa
[6:43:37] Reign_69: If wow comes to console which it likely will, it will be Cloud Based
[6:43:55] FranciscoTheMage: @Towelliee not sure if you answer this the other day.. is GW2 new expac on your Radar?
[6:44:03] mmo_kenna_: ESO runs amazing on the new consoles so I think WoW could
[6:44:24] Snabido: Rarity just tryna give you less hope to avoid island spamming
[6:44:30] Moobot: Towelliee booted up his YouTube channel again! Check out the latest YouTube video HERE || Ranking EVERY World Of Warcraft Expansion - WoW Tier List youtu.be/CLrPHWHnfEw
[6:44:42] Gillyman333: talking about the 360 lmao
[6:44:44] XvatisTheHunter: Would have a way more ranged playerbase on WoW if it comes on console
[6:44:49] mandilozano: @Towelliee if you are in a pre made group you can just que inside the instance, no need to leave party
[6:44:52] Dinermoe: how on earth are you binding all yout shit on a controller
[6:44:58] ScratchSpy: @FranciscoTheMage ^
[6:45:00] Pepperoni_meloni: Guh, I still remember getting my Infinite Timereaver, I felt so cringe, I had quit in WoD, came back few weeks before legion launch and did Timewalking, first dungeon, second boss dropped it for me and I thought it was a free mount. But seeing a friend who has 9700+ attempts. Sheeeesh
[6:45:08] metavahn231: some things just not meant for console
[6:45:09] mikejames01: FF 14 does it
[6:45:19] monute316: monute316 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 93 months! looking up at 100 boss man
[6:45:21] Chronine: how would addons work
[6:45:25] bypized: FF14 does it
[6:45:26] ThaOriginalGamester: it has to be a console only version
[6:45:30] JackHealMe: There is a dude who PvPs with an xbox controller
[6:45:31] zoovthepally: demon hunter plays well with a controller
[6:45:31] metavahn231: ff has 2.5 gcd lol
[6:45:33] pilltillkill: @mikejames01 yeah its great but with the higher gcd and stuff it pads for it better, and of course the addon issue
[6:45:36] sorrel_n: Haven't tried consoles in years. Can you just use a bluetooth keyboard and mouse on them?
[6:45:44] GamerKillance: @Towelliee That's a lie FF14 does have addons. Look at the world first races
[6:45:45] beckett3a: it'd be cooler if they made they own God of War-type series set in wow for both pc and consoles than port WoW
[6:45:45] Snabido: Not necessarily addons, surely mechanics are harder to perform on a controller?
[6:45:48] dewking93: would console wow have dbm built in?
[6:45:50] sarbapowa: wow on controller?
[6:45:55] killercondon: I saw a video where the guy played on controller as a joke
[6:46:03] Morpheusx25: @GamerKillance 3rd party which arent allowed
[6:46:03] JiberishUI: It’s insaaane how customizable you can make wow
[6:46:05] Rottencoarse: @Towelliee  isnt Desmephisto playing with controller?
[6:46:10] Rottencoarse: if i'm not mistaken?
[6:46:10] ThaOriginalGamester: no crossplay in M+ and Raids... with different tuning?
[6:46:12] zoovthepally: yeah ive used that console port add on before with DH and it felt great... Not sure how healing or tanking would work
[6:46:18] FranciscoTheMage: lol i guess that answers the question @ScratchSpy ... not on his radar
[6:46:20] athalon: got my 5 spare controllers for raid tonight
[6:46:20] Pepperoni_meloni: @Towelliee So did limit technically get.... Liquid'ated? Kappa
[6:46:33] JiberishUI: Xbox coming out with an mmo controller
[6:46:33] pilltillkill: @Biby07 not really but it doesnt have a higher number of individual abilities actually used in the rotations
[6:46:36] youzeon: @towelliee can you give more of an explanation on what you meant by different for 10.0?None of the leaks feel like they are going in the direction you said it was, aka a truly different experience.
[6:46:39] pilltillkill: @Biby07 it does have*
[6:46:42] Unwary: xbox controllers have a keyboard attachment that can really help, not too obtrusive
[6:46:47] GamerKillance: @Morpheusx25 They are allowed, but you're not allowed to berate people with them. Yoshida said this himself and watches the races. He knows addons will be used no matter what hence the rule change back in Heavenesward
[6:46:47] Laelas_sm: yeah depending on job... things like bard have a million buttons to hit whereas tanks have only a few per second
[6:46:50] Aveuree: @Towelliee are you farming the infinite Timewaster
[6:46:53] Legnatis: xbox has mouse and keyboard support
[6:46:57] ThaOriginalGamester: KB and mouse only lol
[6:46:57] xThatDevil: OMEGALULK
[6:46:57] xFevers: whooosh
[6:47:02] mmo_kenna_: i play wow on controller its not as bad as you think, but im not a MDI star or mythic raider
[6:47:04] JiberishUI: Xbox for sure coming out with an mmo controller with waaay more buttons @towelliee
[6:47:04] twistedstick1: Doesn't xbox and PS support keyboard/mouse?
[6:47:07] grapyz: I just cant imagine playing druid on controller so people would have to buy M and K
[6:47:10] alextheory_: Liquify is the new guild
[6:47:17] Voodoochild77: All that Limit merch now vintage....LOL KEKW
[6:47:20] InsaneToons: xbox and razer came out with a keyboard for xbox it also supports mouse.
[6:47:25] youzeon: @towelliee can you give more of an explanation on what you meant by different for 10.0?? None of the leaks feel like they are going in the direction you said it was, aka a truly different experience.
[6:47:26] mandilozano: how tf you heal with a controller
[6:47:26] FranciscoTheMage: question is.. im not buying a new XBOX... will my XBOX ONE run WOW?
[6:47:33] pilltillkill: @FranciscoTheMage easily
[6:47:36] tomcruise210: @twistedstick1 i psure xbox does
[6:47:38] sarbapowa: do you have goldenmane mount? @Towelliee
[6:47:42] tomcruise210: @twistedstick1 dont know about PS
[6:47:46] rivera9: they all DIE
[6:48:00] twistedstick1: The issue is going to be addons then. Not the control.
[6:48:04] mmo_kenna_: You heal with Raid cursor, you use the D pad to toggle through unit frames
[6:48:09] ditaern: @mandilozano d-pad cycles through party, macros for main-tank, off tank
[6:48:09] srze94: hopefully it wont, but it could for enough $$$
[6:48:15] Aidler: limit didn't get liquidated technically... only literally...lol
[6:48:17] JackHealMe: Console port HOTS
[6:48:23] mandilozano: @mandilozano yeah good luck with that
[6:48:24] metavahn231: it would be impossible to play the character properly on the controller, it would have to be a different console only version
[6:48:24] grindtime23: wow not being so addon heavy wouldn't be a bad thing
[6:48:28] onous_: If Bill Gates wants it Bill Gates will make it happen.
[6:48:31] Legnatis: @Towelliee xbox does have mouse and keyboard support
[6:48:33] GamerKillance: Hey FF14 made it work so WoW can too. Lets not forget FF14 has far more buttons to use than WoW
[6:48:34] ironforge_1337: KEKW
[6:48:38] t0rstin: Xbox Keyboard INCOMING
[6:48:39] xxxwaxyxxx: you imagine not having 20 key bindings
[6:48:40] Sollice: No reason why xbox wow cant run addonws
[6:48:42] blacksheep806: LUL
[6:48:43] FranciscoTheMage: but how would other players KNOW
[6:48:43] Sollice: Xbox is windows based
[6:48:44] ThaOriginalGamester: well they did refer to WoW as a brand now instead of a game... there are going to be at least 4 official versions of it
[6:48:44] JohnLeMay: there would be controller guilds
[6:48:44] Chronine: @GamerKillance the game is also far slower than wow
[6:48:44] pilltillkill: @GamerKillance yeah but the higher gcd makes that more manageable
[6:48:45] ironforge_1337: screw consoles #pcmasterrace
[6:48:45] dewking93: maybe they have servers for console only like eso
[6:48:47] NeoVLace: So the way the Ascended repent a soul (Uther) is by putting him in timeout staring at a wall? Hilarious.....!
[6:48:48] Unwary: "LFM Rated BGs, NO XBOX CONSOLE PLAYERS" KEKW
[6:48:50] athalon: World quest controller jail
[6:48:52] Sukaiberu: @Towelliee you can also use a keyboard on an xbox, but your right add-on would be the killer. Just look at Minecraft
[6:48:53] onous_: Bill Gates is your daddy.
[6:48:54] flo_406: tbf a good controller player would prob be better then 90% of the wow community lol
[6:48:56] Jarless: why couldnt console run addons??
[6:48:58] torbentidligereandfox01: @Towelliee didnt Swifty play WoW on a handheld?
[6:49:02] GamerKillance: They could very well add the same GCD if they make it for console
[6:49:03] rhino_u: at that point.. just use a pc
[6:49:07] Laffitaffi11: i feel like some ways of playing might be fun like levling a alt or something like that. could be a fun relaxed way to level
[6:49:10] mandilozano: @GamerKillance no thanks
[6:49:12] pilltillkill: @Jarless how could it?
[6:49:12] Sollice: Why do you think you cant use addons>
[6:49:12] JohnLeMay: or join a controller guild
[6:49:15] Sukaiberu: @Towelliee Minecraft has control and console, but its not the same game as PC
[6:49:16] temp3st98: Probably dlcs
[6:49:17] Unwary: microsoft could always do a console verified program for WoW addons
[6:49:18] metavahn231: those keyboards are just for typing your password they are terribad

[6:49:36] sarbapowa: @FranciscoTheMage touchpad warrior? :D
[6:49:37] pilltillkill: yeah wow would have to have official console friendly addons to enact on the console
[6:49:39] InsaneToons: @Towelliee Xbox and Razer designed a keyboard for xbox
[6:49:39] atmfees: i think they'd try to shoehorn wow onto mobile before console
[6:49:40] Melonbrew: @towelliee razer makes keyboard and mouse for xbox
[6:49:42] twistedstick1: WoW 2.0 mobile version.

[6:50:09] zoovthepally: im hoping microsoft does a smash like game with blizz IP and their IP
[6:50:11] Gyhlen: Well i mean you cannot officially use addons/mods for Minecraft on XBOX either.. But if you know the work around it's possible :) Just takes effort

[6:50:35] surpriseparty20: If wow wasnt a DBM shitfest i would
[6:50:37] mandilozano: id play wow in my fridge
[6:50:37] ThaOriginalGamester: ]Just put it on the cloud
[6:50:37] pattar101: no
[6:50:38] Melonbrew: would try it
[6:50:38] Mcaffee: No addons?? are you insane
[6:50:39] Unwary: i wouldn't mind sitting on a couch to do random dungeons
[6:50:39] NeoVLace: will not....I play FFXIV on anything, but I WOULD NOT with Wow
[6:50:40] Jolli776: Not end game stuff, but collecting shit and stuff like that maybe, but still probably no, rather have that on mobile

[6:50:45] Runetailx: Only if it was simplified. Aint happening
[6:50:46] metavahn231: i would kick any console user
[6:50:48] grindtime23: wow needs to reduce the addon reliance
[6:50:48] catswithpica: I’d play wow on my smart fridge
[6:50:48] Ricerev: finally got a 3060, not buying a console
[6:50:53] Unwary: for more hardcore stuff then i'd obviously use pc for superior controls
[6:50:56] Murphybrown: just imagine FFXIV not built for console
[6:50:56] BlindFaithFuel: I would love for a warcraft game that is wow like, but less skill focused and more story, enabling the play on controller
[6:50:56] Ecute: @Ricerev D:
[6:51:00] pixxelina: @CatsWithPica lol
[6:51:01] sorrel_n: If I could play my current account I might occasionally play on console for very casual stuff on the couch
[6:51:03] radakant: Sort of like "Side-Activity" would be cool though. Imagine like instanced scenarios ?
[6:51:08] Sukaiberu: I would try it, question would be if they started classic on console with a controller and lock out addons there
[6:51:08] Morpheusx25: @Ricerev welcome to the 30 series club
[6:51:08] atmfees: will come to Tesla before xbox
[6:51:13] Crimson32: Console can have built in dbm.
[6:51:14] M0nkTV: PC master race, keyboard and mouse age 40
[6:51:18] xFevers: I don think consoles would ever take off. After console players see the Meta is KB+M and RWF guild not taking console players it would die off fast @Towelliee
[6:51:18] sarbapowa: I have 1050 2gb i3 8100k and it runs perfectly fine with all the addons, like just get a cheap pc and that is it
[6:51:18] radakant: sitting on the couch, playing some WoW-Scenarios
[6:51:19] mmo_kenna_: The work has been done, the Addon consoleport makes it possible
[6:51:24] JohnLeMay: ddI haven't bothered playing a console since SNES
[6:51:30] zoovthepally: Classic Season of Console
[6:51:31] HaCKeD_S14: Imagine the uptick in population though if they included wow in gamepass
[6:51:35] BelllGoR: people to lazy to sit a a computer chair lol
[6:51:42] Mcaffee: if they did away with addons then they kill the game forever
[6:51:42] Arceptor: @Ricerev 3080 here, still nothing to play on it
[6:51:43] Broomba: @towelliee -- the people who want wow on console are the ones who want wow 2
[6:51:43] Texodar: they're probably going to do some addon integrations with Bnet, considering it's such a big part of wow
[6:51:45] trivotix: #xboxchanges
[6:51:45] mxrksxn: Do your think they might go down the Bethesda route with having mods (addons) on console?
[6:51:59] Thoreya: Let’s go Bucssssss
[6:52:09] Jigawatts42: WoW 2 perhaps?
[6:52:11] pilltillkill: yeah claw out of the hole theyre in quality and good faith wise before worrying about a console port
[6:52:12] 322LULS: so you think 10.0 will be a better game?
[6:52:13] Crimson32: Literally just have the addons that are quality of life added into the console version
[6:52:14] Hamners: I prefer Diablo on console though
[6:52:16] sorrel_n: "Thanks to Microsoft we now have the resources to bring back master loot"
[6:52:20] twistedstick1: I was given a PS3 as a gift  use to watch PSvue until it went belly up now I just watch Twitch sometimes.
[6:52:24] FranciscoTheMage: QUESTION.. of the current gaming population.. are there any of them who have NEVER played WOW.. is this who they going after?
[6:52:26] bypized: @towelliee ever seen BDO being played on console?
[6:52:27] LTxMkilla: Just include the wow sub with the Xbox sub and I’ll be happy lol
[6:52:28] pilltillkill: @322LULS microsoft wont even own them yet by the time 10.0 comes
[6:52:32] luckfore: HE KNOWS POGGERS
[6:52:34] mandilozano: wow 2 is going to be a 1st person game like SKYRIM
[6:52:41] FranciscoTheMage: ALL gamers have tried WOW at least once..
[6:52:49] sarbapowa: true
[6:52:49] jerseyfive: use it for bigger yachts LUL
[6:52:51] bypized: towelliee ever seen BDO being played on console?
[6:52:52] sarbapowa: hahah
[6:53:05] GamerKillance: Microsoft now has three MMO's under them @Towelliee . PSO2, ESO and now WoW
[6:53:07] Joneeeez: so true Bobby Kotick just wants the cash rolling in xD
[6:53:10] Pepperoni_meloni: I don't play it but how does ESO handle addons? Since there is cross platform for PC and xbox?
[6:53:22] mmo_kenna_: No addons on ESO console
[6:53:23] FranciscoTheMage: what is PSO2
[6:53:30] mikejames01: ESO is not cross platform play
[6:53:34] Morpheusx25: @Pepperoni_meloni there isnt
[6:53:34] HaCKeD_S14: @towelliee have you thought about the increase in marketing budget that WoW may get again like they used to? Imagine commercials and other stuff
[6:53:38] MrGattz: @Towelliee this addon has been a thing for years. works really well, iv used quite a bit. wow works pretty well with controller https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/console-port
[6:53:41] GamerKillance: Ooof
[6:53:42] 00joseph: i got my gaming PC like last year but i havent been back to WoW since i was in middle school going into high schoool so i wouldnt mind trying it on console @Towelliee
[6:53:46] borgking82: @Towelliee i just hope there's less $ubgateing with xbox as the boss
[6:53:49] Aidler: Microsoft's quarterly reports won't be affected much by what blizzard does
[6:53:52] mikejames01: xbox one to xbox series x that sit
[6:53:52] Ricerev: night elf mohawk and toyota tacoma
[6:53:53] Milanesa_De_Pollo: They need to merge their MMOs to remove inner compitition
[6:53:53] zoovthepally: touch the balls
[6:53:55] HaxzorJimDuggan: techically sega owns phantasy star its just exclusive
[6:54:03] Aveuree: Bluehole make the ps version for TERA Online but as I mentioned completely Seperated from the PC. @Towelliee
[6:54:17] mandilozano: LUL
[6:54:18] Thoreya: Best thing to happen to WoW was the Microsoft acquisition
[6:54:22] 322LULS: lol
[6:54:24] ClipCraft: you dont KEKW
[6:54:26] Sielu11628: Shadowlands
[6:54:27] matx83: badly
[6:54:29] Jigawatts42: SEGA owns PSO2
[6:54:33] 00joseph: lmao ESO graphics is trash
[6:54:34] FranciscoTheMage: @Milanesa_De_Pollo THATS the problem with MSFT. thats why acquisitions go so bad there. THE company makes divisions compete.
[6:54:36] TheCliffyShow: Black magic
[6:54:38] Thundercat_Actual: @towelliee microsoft is focused on Gamepass and the value of it, thats why the only WoW thing they will tweak is adding sub to your gamepass ultimate subscription like they did with EA
[6:54:40] zoovthepally: Microsoft MMO multiverse
[6:54:40] mikejames01: Wish ESO had cross play
[6:54:41] pilltillkill: @Thoreya best thing for stocks, we've yet to see the actual internal improvements
[6:54:43] ArcaneSyntax: @Towelliee I also don't think wow's apm works on a controller, like wow is way faster than mmos like ESO and FFXIV
[6:54:46] FranciscoTheMage: Thats why it could go SIDEWAYS for BLizzz
[6:54:55] pilltillkill: @ArcaneSyntax its spammy yes
[6:54:59] jukla12: @00joseph yea wow graphics is so much better KEKW
[6:55:02] mandilozano: like make each MMO in wow where you can go to each MMO in the map
[6:55:13] 00joseph: lmao
[6:55:14] xFevers: KEKW
[6:55:20] Jigawatts42: OGCDs maybe
[6:55:20] TheGaoSora: On the music maybe
[6:55:21] ThorH13: Cross play need to be a standard on games that are not exclusive
[6:55:22] trivotix: Attacks per millenium?
[6:55:26] pilltillkill: does have faster apm, just more abilities used in a rotation. wow just has like 5 button rotations where you spam certain abilities
[6:55:29] metavahn231: ffxiv faster is only faster in the opener for some classes, in general its way slower
[6:55:34] Thoreya: LUL
[6:55:35] Aidler: Microsoft always had strong internal competition and knows how to handle it
[6:55:47] worldhealer: def
[6:55:49] pilltillkill: yeah wow has higher apm due to spam, but the rotations aren't technical
[6:55:51] sarbapowa: need to faceroll
[6:55:51] TheGaoSora: because each FF skill has long a** fanfare
[6:55:55] twistedstick1: Almost football time.
[6:55:55] metavahn231: but WoW is 5 buttons lol
[6:56:00] ArcaneSyntax: I looked it up once, the fastest in FFXIV was ninja at like 50 apm, which is on the slower side for wow
[6:56:00] NoSelfJustice: imagine trying to do a warlock rotation on a gamepad -_-
[6:56:02] Kharmadilloz: because the gcd is higher in ff
[6:56:03] HexcsTV: FF suck hard
[6:56:07] Yonkoj: I think the biggest thing is most ffxiv classes seem to have a pretty static rotation and wow is a lot more proc based
[6:56:11] tomcruise210: @BunnyO3U i mean the game itself is pretty meh
[6:56:21] Chronine: imagine healing a m+ or raid on a controller
[6:56:25] metavahn231: WoW is like a monkey on crack hiting 1 button as fast as possible, FFXIV is a galaxy brain piano
[6:56:27] monute316: so have you gone crazy tet with the time walking spam
[6:56:30] pereadin: WoW Loot Boxes INC KEKW
[6:56:42] CDT_tv: well microsoft mostly leaves there studios to do what they want

[6:56:52] twistedstick1: More store Mounts. They have to get that money back. hehe
[6:56:54] mandilozano: @elixirfield1 then go watch the countless vtuber that play the game in twitch KEKW
[6:57:03] GamerKillance: Shit ton of microtransactions for sure, but no loot boxes
[6:57:06] Runetailx: thing is u can only use 2 oGCD abilities in between GCDs in 14.
[6:57:13] NoSelfJustice: 66 attempts and only at 1.64% feelsbadman
[6:57:18] FranciscoTheMage: isn't MSFT the one doing Sea of Thieves.. hows that one going.. good still?

[7:00:04] mikejames01: for sure on the addons

[7:08:25] nihilistic_bat: @5rooms I member running one of the others so many times for a tank shield
[7:08:34] xFevers: Nah 80 renown would be a 9.2.5 thing if it does happen
[7:08:36] Aidler: according to wowhead you need 20k attempts to get the Jeeves schematic.... that can't be right?
[7:09:00] mandilozano: 69 attemps
[7:09:04] FranciscoTheMage: @Towelliee what you gonna do with GW2 and its expansion
[7:09:10] ElDrakenMan: @Towelliee do you think returning to the game is a good idea if you dont play on raiding or running mythic +?
[7:09:12] zoovthepally: i love the voice lines from the last boss in this dungeon
[7:09:28] Snabido: Instead of sources dropping 1 renown, they drop 2 👀
[7:09:56] mandilozano: @Snabido if you are low enough, the story quests do that now
[7:09:58] rhino_u: that would be great.. the only thing I have to do until release is farm renown
[7:10:01] metavahn231: remove half the grinding systems in WoW
[7:10:05] Ukoshi: Don't zereth morthis quest give renows?
[7:10:06] Dreddmar: i really hope they get rid of mission tables and renown type garbage in 10.0
[7:10:28] Runetailx: Renown wasn't a good idea from the start
[7:10:43] Mamalauu: i agree
[7:11:00] JackHealMe: They'll probably give renown if you're behind, if not I think that's a mistake
[7:11:04] srze94: it would be better just to have one currency per expansion and you get it from everything and you can buy anything with it
[7:11:06] xFevers: Agreed. you need 800 ore of each type for a 235 neck or ring
[7:11:08] Aidler: wod mission tables were interesting
[7:11:14] surpriseparty20: Yep
[7:11:29] 322LULS: the problem with renown is to farm them with every single character, instead of grinding each 1 of the four and having them account wide

[7:38:06] FranciscoTheMage: it would be a reason to play Classic tho
[7:38:12] surpriseparty20: meanwhile the blizzard devs "Hmmm Noted"
[7:38:24] tomcruise210: they need to do something

[7:41:07] xThatDevil: @Towelliee What about the Trial of the Crusader Ach. No DEATHS on heroic
[7:41:08] tomcruise210: think they will add acheivements to wrath classic?? we would have two versions of achievements
[7:41:09] pilltillkill: @at1c The Lich King was planted by the Jailer's forces to give him a foothold on Azeroth. The Natherzim seem to have still given Kil'jaeden the armor that would let Ner'zhul's soul control the undead, but they didn't actually craft it. Or they did who the hell knows, but it came from the Shadowlands. The Lich Kings we've had all somehow resisted the Jailer's domination and did their own thing.
[7:41:21] pilltillkill: @at1c Apparently the entirety of the Burning Legion was some long plan by the Jailer. So even Sargeras' corruption was the Jailer's fault. Cause eff it.

[14:48:25] Nico_vdM: can you lock gateway over the circle?
[14:48:25] Plague_GG: So does boomy @rohdey no sense in bringing a feral for roar when you have an op boomkin

[14:48:36] Plague_GG: Shade
[14:48:42] Heyhowsitgoingtonight: that bills v chiefs game was insane

[14:50:24] gotbrick316: thats what I'm hoping for
[14:50:25] Kinghorn: how many night fae pve paladins are there, like 10?
[14:50:28] Nico_vdM: Blas0n's tier list KEKW
[14:50:49] Vivelli: hows havoc and fire mage shaping up this tier so far?
[14:51:03] skymercii: @Heyhowsitgoingtonight i think the nfl fucked josh out of a chance
[14:51:26] Nico_vdM: That glyph hurts
[14:51:28] skymercii: im not even a bufflo fan
[14:51:31] bigchunguss_605: Yeah, the overtime rules are garbage imo
[14:51:33] skymercii: buffalo*
[14:52:04] Heyhowsitgoingtonight: @bloodyreapr bills defense was made of paper when it mattered most
[14:52:29] Vivelli: folded like origami

[14:52:54] skymercii: im hoping my team does better next season
[14:52:56] Kinghorn: LUL
[14:53:20] Kinghorn: this boss sucks, full stop
[14:53:25] Heyhowsitgoingtonight: 49ers have the best defense left in the playoffs
[14:53:34] Vivelli: whats the bug?
[14:53:38] Vivelli: or issue?
[14:53:51] rorlore: tuning i would imaginre
[14:53:54] rorlore: imagine
[14:53:55] skymercii: think brady or rodgers gonna retire this year?
[14:54:01] Heyhowsitgoingtonight: no
[14:54:21] Nico_vdM: like in CN, a tank gets debuffed and needs to GTFO or kill the raid.  but at the same time they have to dodge the rings coming or going out
[14:54:24] Heyhowsitgoingtonight: Rodgers to the 49ers
[14:54:50] skymercii: chiefs vs 49ers?
[14:54:52] Vivelli: ah overtuned got it u were right rorlore
[14:55:09] rorlore: which is they way it should be before release right?
[14:55:19] rorlore: undertuned would be worse imo
[14:55:26] rorlore: for practice
[14:55:32] Heyhowsitgoingtonight: I think the Bengals win v chiefs
[14:55:41] skymercii: oh most def
[14:56:00] bigchunguss_605: Be nuts if bengals pull it off
[14:56:03] skymercii: im going for the bengals cus im an lsu fan so that was an easy decision
[14:56:04] Vivelli: yea even going into live overtuned > undertuned
[14:56:06] Nico_vdM: Its probably better for them to overtune during the testing and lower it for live, than to go the oppisite direction
[14:56:11] Heyhowsitgoingtonight: chase is nice
[14:56:18] rorlore: forsure Nico

[18:54:11] Draco_wolfstein: would the lvl matter
[18:54:42] shaygauge24: bills mafia is causing a shortage of popov liquor
[18:54:51] Draco_wolfstein: I really want to see this drop
[18:55:16] Heyhowsitgoingtonight: They had the best regular season defense

[18:56:57] shaygauge24: i think the temp def factored into that game being so low scoring. Receivers couldnt catch shit with numb hands
[18:57:02] Heyhowsitgoingtonight: 6 wins in a row
[18:57:16] Heyhowsitgoingtonight: Jamarr Chase is insane
[18:57:19] Bayne77: it happened just a few weeks ago
[18:57:29] shaygauge24: imagine being a receiver in lambo field sub 0 degrees F trying to catch darts lmao
[18:57:36] shaygauge24: sounds awful
[18:57:40] Heyhowsitgoingtonight: He's the future of the league at wide receiver I think
[18:57:46] Xsidious: i had bills and 9ners but i got cincy and 9ners

[19:00:53] Turkmouse: I know they did. Typical Rams almost blew it
[19:01:13] Heyhowsitgoingtonight: No way he retires after being either mvp or second in mvp voting
[19:01:19] Xsidious: Rams looking like the falcons at the last couple of mins
[19:01:24] Laffitaffi11: I think Brady will be back for one more year
[19:01:47] Heyhowsitgoingtonight: The TB12 diet is real
[19:01:50] wEiRdO_dUdE: Brady looked like he can play another year
[19:01:51] Nillianx: He wants number 8

[19:05:37] Sambhur: @towelliee have you seen the mount drop on this 24HR stream?
[19:05:37] Aro725: I wish they would do timewalking raid like this. I love grinding old raids for cool gear and pumping in timewalking

[19:10:29] lightninq: what ilvl does it drop at 60?
[19:11:42] Aro725: Hell yeah, i love wrath dungeons. I think its just cause the classes were so fun to play. everything pumped and threat was so much better than tbc/classic. You didnt pucker your cheecks if you came close to pulling threat on accident
[19:13:52] Aro725: extremely faceroll lol. but the icc ones were sick
[19:14:06] Draco_wolfstein: I liked the ones with chromie

[20:08:01] BoezIRL: wow
[20:08:03] Draco_wolfstein: no drops at all for all of the stream
[20:08:06] Draco_wolfstein: 20 hours
[20:08:29] realnzall: I just did some math. If I did the TW weekly on each of my 60s, it would take me 4 hours of play every day for the entire event

[20:13:09] stayliftedna: @irishwhiskey__ For alot of players coming from Warcraft 3 it was the lore and characters they knew most, WoW at the time of that expac was the most accesible to casual players with the launch of dungeon finder and 10 man raids

[20:21:57] BlueBeast33: I unsubbed for the first time in 16 years, but I'll probably give 10.0 a try when it's finally out.
[20:22:08] Draco_wolfstein: the person I played the most with passed away
[20:22:15] swoopdawooshh: im playing ffxiv rn and its great! but i miss wow and their class options more.

[20:25:07] smooshywolf: I like to go to FFXIV from time to time, then I realize how WoW and FFXIV are like two halves of a perfect experience, one has was the other doesn't
[20:25:12] AyoItsTai: thing is FF is missing challenging/engaging content (12k+hour vet here) wow had much more options on that side even back when i peaked in cata/mop

[20:26:13] Reap14: @taisan0225 that isn't true man..you can play any content since the game launched and sync it down. I highly doubt you have cleared everything since launch.
[20:26:22] DestinamueGaming: ohhhhh
[20:26:28] smooshywolf: if an mmo could come out at some point that could combine the strengths of WoW and FFXIV with none of the drawbacks that would be the perfect mmo I think

[20:31:33] Visinatrix: !uptime
[20:32:09] 2MakeMe: yea wow characters are not "Warriors of light"
[20:32:09] Dagomarus: Most impressive thing for a mmo for me is when people are invested in the story of the universe so many mmos just have people who just play to play and skip all the story and flavor text
[20:32:41] BlueBeast33: 14's story was easy for me to go through since I had already played SWTOR and GW2 both with main story questlines.
[20:32:46] catfella: skipping is fine if you don't want to do that part of the game and just want to play with friends. not everyone is invested like that
[20:32:55] Reap14: XIV is getting the roadmap for the future next month. It should be an interesting stream.
[20:33:03] YamJam07: When it starts to feel like a chore with little reward something is wrong. idk somethings different about shadowlands
[20:33:37] Draco_wolfstein: ff 14 the story works for it cause that is the core of the game
[20:33:50] smooshywolf: I'm really excited for the possibility of Cross Faction grouping in WoW.
[20:34:02] xanarel22: had to quit wow for my own health because i was flamed in every other M+ group for making minor mistakes, getting called slurs and whatnot as if i was in a CoD lobby. I really wish that didn't happen. I don't know how to fix that.
[20:34:02] Valestrus: whats the drop chance of this mount?
[20:34:23] BlueBeast33: The new Ultimate is a pretty big deal, at least in the raiding community
[20:34:39] Draco_wolfstein: while wow focus on loot grind rep grind ect
[20:34:40] Reap14: I have a feeling the game will have self contained expansion stories from here on out but I could be wrong.
[20:34:47] YamJam07: wait theres a mount that drops in this dungeon?
[20:35:11] Molvonos: @YamJam07 Erry timewalking dungeon
[20:35:28] blade_killa: still no mount? D:
[20:35:35] Okri24: @bladeicekilla Not yet
[20:35:39] Reap14: Why is the mount drop rate this low?
[20:35:40] BlueBeast33: They're also adding a new deep dungeon this expansion which I'm looking forward to
[20:35:43] blade_killa: @okri24 dam
[20:35:44] swoopdawooshh: its impossible to make the perfect mmo for everyone. so many people like different aspects of the game they play. i just like when people are nice lol
[20:35:45] eakiller: don't you need sleep @Towelliee
[20:35:48] Valestrus: @Molvonos do you know what the  drop chance for this?
[20:35:54] Colt_Engineer: What you think of coming to america 2?
[20:35:55] feelu_: my prince!
[20:36:01] Okri24: @bladeicekilla Its gotta drop soon
[20:36:05] swoopdawooshh: LUL
[20:36:07] Draco_wolfstein: wow does have deep story behind it
[20:36:13] blade_killa: @okri24 surly right LUL
[20:36:25] holychief26: WAY too much trash in the new raid - prove me wrong.
[20:36:26] Dagomarus: Its the real you? I shall never wash these eyes again! LUL
[20:36:47] Molvonos: @Valestrus You have a better chance of squeezing a diamond out of your asshole than having this drop.  Or, 100%.  Depending on luck.
[20:37:19] holychief26: Cringe
[20:37:20] PlayKn1ght: @holychief26 more trash = more boe = more gold
[20:37:24] Draco_wolfstein: it was epic
[20:37:27] Valestrus: @Molvonos i just pooped two diamonds this morning. Good sign no?
[20:37:35] Colt_Engineer: do we get to clense anduin?
[20:37:38] holychief26: Big grats - ours kept bugging out if we reset them. LEsson learnt - don't lust the shitty trash
[20:37:50] swoopdawooshh: f's in chat for anduin
[20:37:55] the_gody: asking a wow player if he sleeps lol
[20:37:55] holychief26: @PlayKn1ght Except most BOE's are in Tier set slots LUL
[20:38:03] smooshywolf: I took a look at some of the Jailers abilities in the new raid and a certain ability is making a come back and it makes my skin crawl haha
[20:38:44] wreaveit: probably as a dragon :P
[20:38:44] Moobot: Towelliee booted up his YouTube channel again! Check out the latest YouTube video HERE || Ranking EVERY World Of Warcraft Expansion - WoW Tier List youtu.be/CLrPHWHnfEw

[20:39:07] swoopdawooshh: champion! heal her woooons
[20:39:09] joontet: Azeroth is a dwarf female
[20:39:11] smooshywolf: Defile is my Achilles heal lol

[20:40:10] PvtHudson093: in march
[20:40:26] PvtHudson093: it is a nice looking mount
[20:40:38] holychief26: Every launch feels like a marathon for you - ngl
[20:40:43] swoopdawooshh: MoP was when i started playing~
[20:40:59] susta1nn: haha i remember mate
[20:41:03] Richton867: I remember watching that on Justin.
[20:41:33] Dagomarus: I always enjoy the launch partys where we wait for launch of a new expansion so exciting
[20:41:42] holychief26: In a way - I actually genuinely miss the opening leveling experience of a new expansion. I think thats the part that was most fun
[20:41:58] Richton867: I’d first started watching streams and found it so weird that like 10k people were paying to watch someone play wow lol
[20:42:09] Richton867: And spamming hammers.
[20:42:49] irishwhiskey__: Next WoW expansion will probably be delayed, right?
[20:42:56] smooshywolf: I miss going to the store at midnight to pick up the physical copy of WoW expansions XD
[20:43:03] yunitoYuniro: Lost ark can’t wait
[20:43:05] Draco_wolfstein: what do you think will be a good class to start with in lost ark
[20:43:12] smooshywolf: during releases
[20:43:18] catfella: pets
[20:43:30] the_gody: pets
[20:43:35] geokouts: pets ofc :P
[20:43:45] susta1nn: hahaha
[20:44:46] AyoItsTai: how much time is left to get ksm?
[20:44:57] zenity360: will we get wrath before next xpac?
[20:45:10] Draco_wolfstein: hanging out midnight launch at game stop
[20:45:10] catfella: probably not
[20:45:15] BlueBeast33: Early 2023 release I'm assuming is the most likely
[20:45:16] summer_time_rendering: You must be really font of grinds if you are to play lost ark
[20:45:16] AyoItsTai: think im resubbing
[20:45:19] AyoItsTai: rip
[20:45:44] rmpittypie: uloved bfa?
[20:45:57] theoneeleven: thinking Towelliee doesnt like grinds KEKW
[20:46:00] AyoItsTai: i unironically liked doing 5 mask visions
[20:46:05] Colt_Engineer: no Destiny 2 has a grind, let me tell ya
[20:46:34] PoppaShot: rum n coke @Towelliee  KEKW
[20:46:37] CrusaderNero: BfA was ok, but to much useless shite grinds
[20:46:40] theoneeleven: rum and cok to be precise
[20:46:42] Balkep: Lost Ark kind of has a pause button if you play only 1 character, since there are grind limitations
[20:47:16] Flippyyz: um thats not Rumcock. Rum N Coke
[20:47:31] Flippyyz: Rumcock would be better
[20:47:34] smooshywolf: haha
[20:47:40] Gizadragon: lol
[20:47:45] CrusaderNero: rumcock is better
[20:47:47] Draco_wolfstein: rumcocked
[20:47:50] Dmajor7: I mean it could be rum n cock
[20:47:51] vadergod1980: LUL
[20:47:52] DestinamueGaming: lol
[20:47:59] smooshywolf: Rumcock is the next evolution of the name.
[20:48:04] pixxelina: morning, guess it hasn't dropped yet
[20:48:07] xantivius: Ramcock
[20:48:08] joontet: Sounds like a good name for a Troll
[20:48:11] Colt_Engineer: @Towelliee you see that an 70 year old wow player got banned for suspect of botting when he just played solo stuff?
[20:48:19] DestinamueGaming: meh rumcook is like a 5/10
[20:48:29] CrusaderNero: @Colt_Engineer wtf really?
[20:48:58] Colt_Engineer: @CrusaderNero lol yeah, he didn't do raids, or dungeons or pvp, just leveled and crafted, transmog, all the stuff you can do solo and he got banned
[20:49:00] NoSelfJustice: yeah 70 year old banned for "suspected" botting lmao
[20:49:17] CrusaderNero: @Colt_Engineer thats horrible. Did Blizzard fix the mistake?
[20:49:22] smooshywolf: what the heck that's lame @colt_engineer
[20:49:49] Colt_Engineer: @CrusaderNero yeah his grandson posted on the reddit asking why his grandpa was banned, they looked into it and he's unbanned
[20:49:58] DestinamueGaming: hahaha
[20:50:03] CrusaderNero: @Colt_Engineer phew thats good atleast!
[20:50:10] Snurp90: instant sock on head
[20:50:14] HDrx: happened to me before Sadge
[20:50:19] Draco_wolfstein: first night then you black out
[20:50:42] Draco_wolfstein: I like when it catches up to you when you stand up
[20:50:59] CrusaderNero: yeah just dont stand up at all. keep sitting. even sleep where you sit

[21:02:29] khazroi: lies, they show no proof, servers are empty
[21:02:33] Balkep: might be due to classic
[21:02:39] Dinermoe: china alone could carry WoW i think
[21:02:39] twelvethirtyfour: Ad 1 of 7 lmao what
[21:02:42] ltcsheppard5: ea is the only company right now that is worried about a dying game in bf2042
[21:02:52] piratechris: My servers aren't empty
[21:02:59] Lintgamer: This would be so bad if they would do this. https://twitter.com/Deepshades7/status/1485548117441269762

[21:03:15] luckfore: i dont like wow so it has to be dead right??
[21:03:22] Reap14: Did they put you back on the payroll or something? You were dead set against the game for months.
[21:03:22] mezza77: @khazroi speak for yourself… my server is still as busy as it ever was
[21:03:24] Dinermoe: servers are empty during maintenance Kappa
[21:03:33] kamatarakop: its not doing well, but it aint dead
[21:03:33] PadidinJones: Say you dont like it and have Turalyn make you see the light
[21:03:44] Fyeah: @khazroi  delusions
[21:03:44] NickLeonhearth: Hey. just got Huolon at 25 attempts :D
[21:03:45] havenbirch: WoW is still active, even if people left, and the new Microsoft deal has more people coming back, me  included
[21:03:48] lunatic_baboon: We report Blizzard to the SEC for misreporting their numbers EZ
[21:03:49] WestonTeli: imagine hatewatching a videogame LMAO
[21:03:50] khazroi: low population servers are the majority, look at it yourself bro, login and show us the list of servers
[21:03:53] twelvethirtyfour: Wow unfortunately is just not even close to the quality of so many other games nowadays
[21:03:55] NoSelfJustice: well here in EU servers are full or over populated
[21:04:09] kamatarakop: i mean i started playing again and am loving it
[21:04:11] pixxelina: people are watching too many Bellular videos
[21:04:12] mezza77: @khazroi cry more lol
[21:04:22] Draco_wolfstein: they still bringing in the money
[21:04:24] Parthuax: Parthuax subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 3 months! Love you dude, I've been following for a while now and I admire your consistency.
[21:04:28] Shapelessdnb: I kinda miss Wrath man. Those times were something else
[21:04:30] PadidinJones: As soon as Covid breaks, everything will be back to normal
[21:04:34] Chubfishh: Its probably impossible for WoW to die
[21:04:36] nyare__: have you talked about the afrasiabi and sylvanas issue?
[21:04:36] minael1: " i am no longer playing therefore the game is dead". come on...
[21:04:41] piratechris: Are you feeding the trolls magic shrooms Towel?
[21:04:42] Scoodles91: have you tried new world to say that ? :D
[21:04:46] NoSelfJustice: wow has it's own quality.
[21:04:47] khazroi: it is still the best game there is in the mmo scene YES i agree, but it is nowhere near where it was even in WOD
[21:04:51] Dinermoe: dude wtf, it's 2 am server time, ofc there arent as many people
[21:04:51] lunatic_baboon: Dude, I hate people like that - and they're a lot. The reports are relatively good. Is it good in comparison to the past? No. Is that a sign that they're doing something bad with the expansions? Could be. However, WoW is 15+ years old. WoW 15 years ago existed in another world. I don't think people realize just how much the world has changed in the past few years. WoW's not only competing with other games, but with the hole entertainment industry.
[21:04:58] starwindproductions: Social Media has made everyone super negative
[21:05:14] lunatic_baboon: For a game to be a money machine like this after 15 years? Shit, I'd love to be in Blizz' spot KEKW
[21:05:17] PadidinJones: @starwindproductions Yep
[21:05:18] Scoodles91: it was for the guy who said wow is not on the quality of other games
[21:05:18] Lothlorienbgd: the I'm mad at Blizz so wow therefor must suck attitude LUL
[21:05:20] ladydaisy1978: i think for every 1 person complaining about the state of wow and/or quitting, there are 10 or 20 that are quiet and still play and like the game.
[21:05:23] ispyyro: ispyyro subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 3 months! Love from the UK
[21:05:25] Dinermoe: did i miss the SoFo run?
[21:05:34] khazroi: bro numbers dont lie, just look at the server list when you login and see for yourself it shows LOW POP everywhere....
[21:05:35] Draco_wolfstein: so much false information out there
[21:05:49] Lothlorienbgd: LUL
[21:05:50] drunken_panda86: stop trash talking games.😀 all mmorpg games have their flaws
[21:05:53] Reydien: social media hasn't made people negative, it has connected the already-negative people to make them think they are the "unspoken majority"
[21:06:02] OnePlayerPete: Does WoW still give you 7 days free game time?
[21:06:05] NoSelfJustice: people are to judgmental, and that's fine. But try the game and be a part of it before you speculate from threads or Vids.
[21:06:06] Lothlorienbgd: dunno I see like 5 full servers at least
[21:06:07] khazroi: never the less it is still the best mmo
[21:06:07] mezza77: @khazroi wrong! I play on a FULL server
[21:06:09] Draco_wolfstein: low pop is some good stuff
[21:06:13] Alepouditsa: coz we all join the popular server danKEK
[21:06:15] duffock: seemed like there were plenty high even full servers an hour ago
[21:06:17] lunatic_baboon: However, public data from rio/wlogs has shown a steep decline in active engagement with the game. If we are to take M+ runs/raids as a metric.
[21:06:21] Shapelessdnb: What are you trying to achieve here LUL
[21:06:25] Draco_wolfstein: for farming mounts and crafting mats
[21:06:28] khazroi: your putting words in my mouth lol i love wow
[21:06:43] vadergod1980: that's deep
[21:06:48] piratechris: @lunatic_baboon I dunno I see ppl all over my server and it's not even high pop
[21:07:13] kamatarakop: has no views on twitch = dead Kappa
[21:07:50] Draco_wolfstein: member back when it was 12 hours sever down time then ques for many more hours
[21:07:50] NoSelfJustice: @kamatarakop i mean last few days i been watching, wow been roughly 40-65k viewers
[21:07:57] piratechris: He felt a disturbance in the force? LUL
[21:07:59] Chubfishh: @Towelliee One major function I would love for them to add is a raidfinder for legacy raids with an option to have it like timewalking or legacy.  I have friends who never played Legion or Wrath and loving the old raids but its just empty transmog runs, easy
[21:08:00] aptrist: What a dedicated individual!
[21:08:04] maccaruso: Feelings are facts Towelliee!!!!
[21:08:10] lunatic_baboon: @lunatic_baboon I was simply saying that for "active engagement" (M+ runs/raids), there's a huge decline. Does this mean people play less? Maybe? We have no data.
[21:08:12] kamatarakop: @kamatarakop thats why there was a "Kappa" at the end
[21:08:13] WestonTeli: khaz, playerbase doesn't matter, you can literally play the game with only 10 people ever lmao
[21:08:26] Dinermoe: europe is full as shit everyday
[21:08:27] pixxelina: EU is doing splendid
[21:08:30] Dinermoe: even low pop realms
[21:08:33] luckfore: eu is dead
[21:08:34] zenity360: people just dont have a reason to sit in the city on retail
[21:08:36] ShadowRuff: only thing that is dead in wow is the australian horde
[21:08:38] Sprootzz: mans probrably on some rinky dinky server
[21:08:39] Okri24: Dreanor EU is still pumping
[21:08:41] Dinermoe: @luckfore KEKW
[21:08:43] NoSelfJustice: EU servers are looking tasty :P
[21:08:43] minael1: on my horde EU server i haven't seen it "low" for years. its always high
[21:08:43] Sprootzz: check illidan or a52
[21:08:43] LokiFM: Wow streamer defends how their game is doing great and nothing is wrong *inset copium emoji*
[21:08:45] eakiller: Europe is in hybernation until next patch

[21:09:05] mrrazputin: EU is full of ppl all the time. Lots of M+ Raids and pvp all day
[21:09:08] Kaldah: We will see how dead it is when 9.2 hits
[21:09:12] Shapelessdnb: Props to you for being so level headed Towelliee
[21:09:16] Draco_wolfstein: or ocianic
[21:09:25] ShadowRuff: negativity = clicks = adds = $
[21:09:28] maccaruso: He's trapped in a glass case of emotion!
[21:09:34] stealthx23: i mean u can with a vpn lol
[21:09:43] kandor01: the yt algorithm made the community that way. Its all clicks
[21:09:44] Reap14: The game is in a shit state regardless of what you say Towel. You are welcome to your opinion but the game literally produces no content.
[21:09:44] Balkep: the whole online gaming culture is negative lately, so much drama and doomsayers
[21:09:51] Draco_wolfstein: towelliee telling the truth

[21:10:24] zenity360: yea it wont, people have moved on from mmo's in general
[21:10:28] geokouts: Trolls saying WoW is dead, NW is dead BUT FFXiV is thriving!!!
[21:10:29] WestonTeli: "game literally produces no content" in a pandemic LMAO
[21:10:30] mezza77: @reap14 you say that but to argue that, there’s thousands of people that still enjoy current WoW
[21:10:30] Reap14: It is #1 in your mind
[21:10:31] minael1: but youtube and twitch are full of scaremongers. doomsayers. ff14 is the hype. wait till it dies too
[21:10:35] rmpittypie: FF14 is #1 actually
[21:10:39] Rudric_Ice: only AOC will have subs like wrath

[21:11:10] Noshpan: Look, I love FFXIV. I'm logged onto it right now, but even I don't think it's #1. #2, maybe.
[21:11:13] piratechris: Im grabbiug popcorn!
[21:11:15] stylos09: XIV will be dead once 9.2 hits
[21:11:15] Dinermoe: what do you mean, they "Kill it" ?
[21:11:18] Draco_wolfstein: I do not think it has droped from number 1 at all
[21:11:19] mrrazputin: @Reap14 yes but no

[21:12:29] geokouts: i LOVE people going on WoW streamers and trying to say FFXIV is better! A bunch of aholes!
[21:12:42] Dinermoe: why do we always have that discussion if it's 100% clear how good WoW is doing numbre-wise
[21:12:45] VIRUSplw: i love how queues in wow are bad but queues in ff14 = hype
[21:12:50] vadergod1980: Wow has always had the server ability

[21:14:47] Draco_wolfstein: are you getting the numbers from world wide
[21:14:50] sinlesssinner: @Shrenko how do we know anything then? lets stop talking :)
[21:14:51] Lothlorienbgd: @okri24 where do they find their info? facebook? LUL
[21:14:51] piratechris: ppl need to stop eating all these magic shrooms LUL
[21:14:51] Dinermoe: found it in my anus, ye
[21:14:53] Draco_wolfstein: eu
[21:14:56] Decree34: a mmo that I know for a fact is actually dead, Wildstar.

[21:15:01] CCG_337: WoW is #1 in your heart, that is the only numbers that you can be sure lol
[21:15:09] smooshywolf: man. Wildstar I miss it.

[21:15:18] Okri24: @okri24 Ladbible topkek
[21:15:26] ChaosRaiser327: Question:  Are Maldrazzian Warriors good or should I stick to Venthyr and do stupid tea parties?
[21:15:31] smooshywolf: rest in peace Wildstar :(
[21:15:31] gotbrick316: Brady losed tonight

[21:16:00] labraxI: how many subs now ?
[21:16:02] geokouts: they try to emulate Atetokumbo (No offence for my fellow Greek) to MJ!
[21:16:02] maccaruso: Brady is a 6th round draft pick and that's all he'll ever be!  #COPIUM
[21:16:03] Draco_wolfstein: not just won them but has been in more super bowls then any qb
[21:16:07] zenity360: who is more impressive to you Brady or Gretzky
[21:16:07] vadergod1980: I respect Brady, but don't like him. I think he's arrogant
[21:16:25] TomaHawK_The_One: @havenbirch  yea but you can have idea by the number of guilds playing or progresing raids , doing content
[21:16:40] smooshywolf: such a pleasant experience - never thought that they'd outright shut it down
[21:16:46] vadergod1980: Gordie Howe
[21:16:54] gotbrick316: Brady or Jordan
[21:16:55] zenity360: when I think of the goats its gretzky/brady/jordan
[21:16:57] N3llee: any new mounts yet?
[21:17:03] PadidinJones: So can Tony Hawk!
[21:17:10] maccaruso: Gretsky is on the same plane as Jordan.  They elevated an entire sport.
[21:17:13] tenpo29: Do you think Brady will go for another season?
[21:17:14] pakamov: I am EU and I started following NFL cuz of Brady. His story and how undervalued he was in the beginning is fascinating.
[21:17:14] Shrenko: who cares about what mmo makes the most money.. just play whats fun. like right now I enjoy gw2 far more than any other mmo on the market. couldnt care less how much money they make, it still gives me thousands of hours of good content
[21:17:15] BigPhatMatt: @Towelliee to change the subject away from the spergs who you think wins it all in the nfl?
[21:17:19] geokouts: everybody should calm down and play whatever they want!! You are not a shareholder to get fired up about DEAD games
[21:17:39] pixxelina: ^
[21:17:41] Reydien: does "mmo" include multiplayer action RPGs?
[21:17:43] TherealEvilgumdrop: @Towelliee been playing for about a month since i came back from leaving mid cata
[21:17:45] Dinermoe: they need a touchdown? Kappa
[21:17:46] zenity360: as i've gotten older i can't keep up with all the shit on the screen, its why i'm playing classic. Legion was the last time i could keep up with everything happening.
[21:17:49] PadidinJones: Or the Rams!
[21:17:59] pakamov: Bengals would make for an epic story
[21:18:00] vadergod1980: "The Bungles"
[21:18:02] duffock: i was hoping for a rams/titans rematch
[21:18:13] smooshywolf: @decree34 yeah, pour one out for good ol Wildstar ;_;
[21:18:13] pakamov: 30 years without playoffs into a Super Bowl PogChamp
[21:18:20] BigPhatMatt: LOL the dark horse 49ers
[21:18:20] PadidinJones: Im just saying anyone who kicks the shit out of Brady deserves the SB
[21:18:22] neunmalelf: Year after year, the emotions about WoW are high as F*.  They must be doing something right! :)
[21:18:27] WestonTeli: why don't we just devide their revenue report by 15 so we get an idea of the highest possible number of subs
[21:18:29] Rudric_Ice: the titans will be back
[21:18:44] vadergod1980: Boomer boosting the bungles
[21:18:45] gotbrick316: Brady is GOAT in NFL Jordan GoAT in NBA Grezky GOAT in NHL who is MLB GOAT??

[21:20:01] neptuun_: Did you see a mount yet, Towelliee?

[21:20:38] stealthx23: @mezza77 doesnt matter minecraft is the dominant game then league lol
[21:20:40] NoSelfJustice: i remember that day like it was yesterday, a very emotional @Towelliee
[21:20:54] Dinermoe: isnt Tetris still number 1 overall?
[21:20:58] vadergod1980: Rematch of what SB @gotbrick316
[21:21:18] PlayKn1ght: Tetris then pokemon?
[21:21:22] Reydien: don't underestimate those asian markets, Dungeon Fighter Online alone grosses almost as much as the entirety of blizzard, let alone WoW
[21:21:39] Dinermoe: the towelliee temple
[21:21:44] havenbirch: Think they'll ever report wow numbers again under Microsoft?
[21:21:44] PlayKn1ght: then COD
[21:21:46] Dinermoe: all hail Phil Spencer
[21:21:55] irishwhiskey__: Wonder how WoW will change after Bobby Coatdick leaves
[21:22:02] Qargory: just dont go doing a wow management special and youll stay in there too
[21:22:10] duffock: you think theyll add wow to game pass?
[21:22:15] stealthx23: sub on game pass
[21:22:15] gotbrick316: @vadergod1980 w/o googling im going to say SB 17
[21:22:15] NoSelfJustice: @irishwhiskey__ for the better hopefully
[21:22:43] Draco_wolfstein: I think microsoft owning it will be a good thing
[21:22:51] Blackknightjm: i like wow token so i can buy in game stuff
[21:22:59] CatsRusOfficial: What about applying the wow token to the Xbox game pass?
[21:23:05] QuaternionSlerp: i like money
[21:23:24] geokouts: In other news Athens is covered in Snow in the pass few hours :P
[21:23:27] gotbrick316: was boomer vs montana
[21:23:28] Sprootzz: sub to gamepass yes!
[21:23:32] denflup: that aint happening
[21:23:36] tdpark_: I wish they remove it, or change to no region lock, cuz I cant purchase wow token
[21:23:43] NoSelfJustice: i have 10 wow tokens in my bag, just waiting for them to go over 300K on EU
[21:24:04] gotbrick316: Tyler caught the winning TD from Montana

[21:24:12] smooshywolf: @irishwhiskey__ If you look at their past acquisition- I won't say it will affect much of anything. I'm taking their acquisition of Mojang as an example. Most impactful thing I see them doing is letting you log into WoW with your Microsoft account like they did with Mojang.
[21:24:22] CCG_337: it might be the other way around wow sub will incluse the game pass, i meas $15 is better than $10 lol
[21:24:37] gotbrick316: great SB, great game
[21:24:42] NoSelfJustice: they could make the sub free, but then the wow token price may increase
[21:24:53] vadergod1980: @gotbrick316 Close SB 16. 1982 . SF won 26-21
[21:25:11] Qargory: wow is a weird one for game pass, with subs and the game store etc
[21:25:29] duffock: not sure, but doesnt the games usually also have to be on xbox for it to be on game pass?
[21:25:49] NoSelfJustice: @duffock but game pass covers PC and Xbox
[21:25:50] Talason: we will see what bill gates thinks
[21:25:50] Qargory: no, theres a pc game pass
[21:26:04] minael1: yeah, but some corporate douche must show they do something at their job, so they might change it
[21:26:11] Draco_wolfstein: game pass and leave token as it is
[21:26:16] stealthx23: lets be real xbox really just wanted candy crush
[21:26:29] Lothlorienbgd: think wow needs marketing at this point? :D
[21:26:33] duffock: @NoSelfJustice yeah i know, but as far as i know those games are on both
[21:26:43] pixxelina: @Lothlorienbgd marketing is always needed
[21:26:47] havenbirch: WoW Token ruins the AH market
[21:26:49] Draco_wolfstein: microsoft has been very sucessful
[21:26:49] piratechris: I find it very plausible that Microsoft may take WoW to new hights
[21:26:53] N3llee: a lot of good talent left wow so MS will certainly need to pony up
[21:26:55] Dagomarus: I don’t think they will add it to game pass, game pass pays for a lot of games that come on game pass for free, if people could play wow just because of game pass, blizzard would lose so much money, devs hate game pass
[21:27:07] NoSelfJustice: "Your worth is my gain" that's Microsoft philosophy
[21:27:11] Colt_Engineer: I haven't seen a commercial for WoW since those celebrity commercial days
[21:27:22] duffock: i could see them adding it to the pass maybe in hopes of getting more players to play and maybe make more money from services/mounts/pets/transmog
[21:27:39] PlayKn1ght: I felt like they were just protecting their COD investment for Xbox lol
[21:27:39] Moobot: towHAMUP Follow Towelliee on twitter so you can be in the know at all times! | twitter.com/towelthetank towKawaii
[21:27:41] NoSelfJustice: @duffock some games on the xbox are not on the PC, quite a few actually.
[21:27:43] havenbirch: WoW being successful = more money
[21:27:57] sinlesssinner: they wont touch BattleNet or any of that, it is its own system that ll add up to XBOX gamepass
[21:27:58] Draco_wolfstein: if they did not think it was worth anything they would not have bought it
[21:28:14] ShadowRuff: what i think they will do is being able to connect your Bnet to your microsoft account and if you have the game pass will give you the next expansion for free with 1 month subscription
[21:28:15] Moobot: Who wins? https://strawpoll.com/cz3q7xfco
[21:28:15] Quojin: Blizzard ads were awesome back in the day
[21:28:22] Dagomarus: I think you could get mounts and transmogs and pets for having a game pass sub that would be good
[21:28:30] stealthx23: wows not the biggest aresnal in this deal tho....cod and mboile game was
[21:28:39] ShadowRuff: by the time we are pro b on 10.2
[21:28:41] piratechris: I would assume that Microsoft will look into enabling more creativity and innovations from the creative teams at Blizzard. That in turn will make the cow produse more milk and more money.
[21:28:58] Draco_wolfstein: its like when disney bought marvel movies
[21:29:08] serbiandruglordx: so funny how americans say call of doody
[21:29:33] piratechris: An expansion can last long as long as we get great content coming steadily
[21:29:34] NoSelfJustice: Pump it with content yeah!
[21:29:43] smooshywolf: I guess I'm not entirely convinced that Microsoft will get too involved with WoW and
[21:29:52] Yagr6: but expansion launches are hype alot of new changes
[21:29:53] smooshywolf: it's direction
[21:29:54] geokouts: MS will surely boost the WoW team budget
[21:30:14] minael1: microsoft won't change anything. not for the good
[21:30:47] Yagr6: microsoft could be the push they need to make wow 2 atleast fund it
[21:30:48] PadidinJones: One simply does not buy Activision/Blizzard and does not invest in WoW
[21:30:52] Dagomarus: It would need to be a general expansion with plenty of different enemies, you cant do a multiyear expansion with just one big bad boss like the jailer, if it takes you 5 years just to kill one guy its like meh
[21:30:53] stealthx23: candy crush biggest goat
[21:30:57] Draco_wolfstein: they going to make there money back
[21:31:05] NoSelfJustice: from a financial point of view, if it's not broke don't fix it? just make it more attractive and bring more people to the game, and back to the game.
[21:31:15] vadergod1980: guidance
[21:31:16] Molvonos: They're gonna make Clippy-themed transmog.
[21:31:22] Darisen: well its kinda broke
[21:31:25] QuaternionSlerp: reminds me of sloot tweeting @billgates to delete boomkins LUL
[21:31:26] assman_ny: Add some resources
[21:31:26] piratechris: They want all the MMO nerds to play WoW is what they want and they have the power to make it happen too
[21:31:37] syla90: @JagrZero a lot of new changes? .. i mean classes havent changed since legion lol

[21:31:42] smooshywolf: yeah I get that, but I don't think they'll completely remake the game like people expect. I'm kinda looking at Microsofts ownership of Mojang and Bethesda. Oh yeah 100% they will help - but some of the discussion i hear is that it's some sort of amazing thing for wow that will change everything. Idk.
[21:31:44] duffock: think we get wow on xobx? i remember there being rumors of it when the 360 came out
[21:32:00] Dagomarus: Ud think diablo 4 will be coming out just around the time that the deal is complete
[21:32:01] Heyhowsitgoingtonight: will the infinite timewaster be the new meme mount that never drops for the channel? @Towelliee
[21:32:14] ahies28: they will invest more into wow more devs ect
[21:32:28] Shrenko: have you seen any Timereaver drop yet during the stream ?
[21:32:35] Lothlorienbgd: finally we can play candy crush while on those long flight paths :D
[21:33:10] Yagr6: @syla90 expansion launches are usually the only time we get changes to talents or spell books
[21:33:11] NoSelfJustice: @Lothlorienbgd lmfao!
[21:33:47] Draco_wolfstein: wow future is going to be bright
[21:34:03] quinraylo: so new expansion 2024 after Microsoft takes over KEKW
[21:34:06] Zippaya: LUL LUL
[21:34:14] Draco_wolfstein: there going to give them free control
[21:34:15] Molvonos: Spencer needs to Suplex Ion into the ground.
[21:34:36] CatsRusOfficial: They will be less money driven like activision was. Miscrosoft will allow them to make the game they want for the players.
[21:34:43] fanta_2k: bullshit. bill gates told them to buy it so that he can avoid this stupid farming
[21:34:43] Kelrem: i mean, i don't know if they will, but they could
[21:35:02] duffock: phil spencer gonna be all like "bring back old talent trees"
[21:35:10] smooshywolf: There is potential yeah - but as you said they aren't gonna do game design stuff yeah. I feel like MS is kinda hands off for those types of things, but they will provide more resources to Blizzard
[21:35:37] maccaruso: Why do you think MS will expand WoW resources and not just maintain status quo?
[21:35:42] Yagr6: i want more frequent talent updates / reworks
[21:35:48] NoSelfJustice: can just imagine phil spencers twitter, just being full of wow players needs and wants lmao
[21:35:55] CatsRusOfficial: Halo is one! They did an amazing job with Halo after many years of failed attempts.
[21:36:19] elvia_: they will intervene on the culture in the company, making sure everything is fine going foward thats all
[21:36:32] Yagr6: flood phils twitter yes
[21:36:36] CatsRusOfficial: Microsoft will allow blizzard to make the game they want instead of being so money driven. Microsoft knows making a game great will bring the revenue instead of 10000 pay to win mounts
[21:37:02] vadergod1980: @towelliee You think bill gates is more or less involved in consulting since the divorce?
[21:37:25] smooshywolf: yeah!
[21:37:29] Zippaya: for sure
[21:37:31] byrdeen45: you get the mount yet
[21:37:35] elvia_: I meant no modification on the games, of course thats huge, sorry bad englendo
[21:38:01] facerolljack: !uptime
[21:38:02] piratechris: There is no way an investor won't be out to maximize their profits. WoW is the king of MMO. Freaking Godzilla, and they want Godzilla to get bigger!
[21:38:36] Scoodles91: its harder to get worst then than :D
[21:38:37] havenbirch: We may not get a full 10.0 reveal this week, but I think we may get a teaser, or an idea about the future beyond 9.2 contentwise
[21:38:43] GiraffeHydra_: @Towelliee we call that "tempting fate"
[21:38:43] Yagr6: hell just look at what microsoft has done in 20 years since they started with xbox... growth
[21:38:48] elvia_: do we have any update on the lawsuit ?
[21:38:49] CatsRusOfficial: Will it still be called activision blizzard?
[21:38:59] geokouts: the strike against Activision-Blizzard ended yesterday
[21:39:05] Moobot: Towelliee booted up his YouTube channel again! Check out the latest YouTube video HERE || Ranking EVERY World Of Warcraft Expansion - WoW Tier List youtu.be/CLrPHWHnfEw
[21:39:05] Blackhaxx: we need 16x the detail
[21:39:10] CrusaderNero: MicroActiBlizz
[21:39:13] duffock: microvisionblizzardsoft
[21:39:17] Yagr6: BlizzSoft
[21:39:22] NoSelfJustice: Unless microsoft is full of seedy men and women too, i can't see it getting worse.
[21:39:25] Pannekaker: Microsoft/Activision/Blizzard/King
[21:39:26] markaimfire_: not sure if you are aware, but you are inside a spaceship my dude
[21:39:31] binkz77: what keeps giving him the wings
[21:39:37] Pannekaker: People always forget the King smh
[21:39:43] elvia_: do we have any update on the lawsuit ? is it over ?
[21:39:46] piratechris: I seriously doubt they want to do much with the Blizzard name. It's a trademark that alone sells games.
[21:39:51] smooshywolf: isn't ESO partially Zenimax too ?
[21:39:56] NickLeonhearth: @Towelliee but MC Blizzard sound like a cool rapper name Kappa
[21:40:03] Pannekaker: I know, I meant in the name seagLUL
[21:40:09] minael1: what the hell is king?
[21:40:19] tdpark_: candy crush
[21:40:40] CrusaderNero: well revenue dont always mean high quality :)
[21:40:49] maccaruso: If they have desktop interfaces for those games it will print them money
[21:40:49] herzlustafir: Its all love tho
[21:41:04] piratechris: I'm very excited to see how the Microsoft aquisition may impact Diablo 4 as a long time Diablo fan
[21:41:11] duffock: maybe we will finally get that modern graphics rock n racing remaster
[21:41:12] Xsilentghost: Theres no way 10.0 releases this year
[21:41:15] Balkep: @CrusaderNero businesses don't care about quality, only about making more money
[21:41:19] CrusaderNero: @gambler1gambler sure, and who gets the better end of the deal when revenue is be all end all?
[21:41:30] PadidinJones: Seeing you spam TW in WOLK reminds me of the good old days when we needed to spam these dungos for gear and orbs
[21:41:32] CrusaderNero: @Balkep somewhat true. can actually do both. I know, its an insane concept
[21:41:43] Pannekaker: @smooshywolf Microsoft owns ZeniMax which owns Bethesda Softworks which owns Bethesda Game Studios
[21:41:44] jostecaptain: Feb 9.2 release would allow a 2022 10.0
[21:41:48] Lothlorienbgd: @PadidinJones I still have a stack of frozen orbs somewhere
[21:42:00] CatsRusOfficial: You'll get beta this year for sure tho.
[21:42:04] CatsRusOfficial: September beta
[21:42:11] obeysupreme76: King is making wow mobile?
[21:42:11] Balkep: @CrusaderNero higher quality means more spending means less overall money
[21:42:11] piratechris: I'm fairly sure that Blizzard really want to dazzle us with 10.0 so yeah 2023 sounds about right
[21:42:27] smooshywolf: @pannekaker oh, yeah - was wondering if I was remembering correctly
[21:42:46] elvia_: blizzard lost 40% of players while making money, meaning people buy shit in those games LUL
[21:42:52] CrusaderNero: @Balkep never said otherwise, but its not good for us. its good for them. And tbh at one point, when is there enough revenue? Its not like ActiBlizz aint printing money
[21:42:53] Ziddrax: yeah bots
[21:42:58] Draco_wolfstein: there are some people that have never stoped
[21:43:04] Buescheric: Hey guys, sorry for the noob question, how can you get the mount Towelliee is farming atm? Is it a random drop from timewalking endbosses?
[21:43:07] binkz77: @Towelliee what is that wingsthat keeps flashing on you
[21:43:11] Ziddrax: LUL
[21:43:21] PadidinJones: bot lives matter! reeee
[21:43:32] Qeevdo: Bots are payers too
[21:43:43] Draco_wolfstein: the wings flashing is his star power
[21:43:47] wayneclarkedev: just woke up - ya at least see it drop for someone else yet?
[21:44:03] duffock: think we will get wrath classic in 2022?
[21:44:07] dawnclaw22: oh i remember this dungeon, nice memories . i have quit after that expansion i think
[21:44:08] elvia_: someone playing my account monkaS
[21:44:11] Buescheric: @abyzmic how to get this mount? Is it a random drop in timewalking?
[21:44:12] Balkep: @CrusaderNero there's never enough revenue, the whole goal of capitalism is to make all of the money if you can
[21:44:46] CrusaderNero: @Balkep true and again, never said otherwise. But that doesnt mean we gotta accept it and keep playing shite games cause they need to increase revenue
[21:44:52] CrusaderNero: its not like we are forced to eat shit
[21:45:03] tdpark_: microsoft probably need to make a new deal with netease
[21:45:06] Flippyyz: lets not forget the king of all MMOs, Runescape KEK
[21:45:12] Draco_wolfstein: money is money no matter where it comes from
[21:45:13] atowellthatiallreadyused: I know a guy who spent atleast 400,000 swedish kroners on wow and yes i know him he have like all the diagnosiss in the alpabeth and where he got all money is short explained relatives who have died so hes a millionare its absurd anyway blizzard got most of his money now kinda sad actually we tried to stop him but we cant tell him either what to do with is own money hes addicted basicly
[21:45:21] VrtniPatuljak: Jiang Xina loves WoW
[21:45:50] CrusaderNero: holy hell 400?
[21:45:54] nour1987: nour1987 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 6 months! 
[21:46:09] Balkep: @CrusaderNero oh yeah, true, people totally vote with their wallet - but apparently there's enough people willing to accept what others find unacceptable
[21:46:15] elvia_: blizzard lost 40% of playerbase while making more money, meaning people buy shit in those games, microtransaction etc
[21:46:28] VrtniPatuljak: schizotwitchen how do you even spend that much, theres only like 10 store mounts
[21:46:30] Hank_Chinaski: Hey Towelliee! Are you planning on playing New York Taxi simulator ever again or doing sub sundays? :) cheers and keep up the stream!
[21:46:49] CrusaderNero: @Balkep sadly yes, people accept it and churn out the money for it
[21:47:05] tdpark_: Netease is listed in Nasdaq: NTES
[21:47:06] atowellthatiallreadyused: not me but my friend did on cutting edges boosting wow tokens etc
[21:47:41] elvia_: oof, buying CE is expensive
[21:47:43] atowellthatiallreadyused: and once he boost a character he get bored of it and deletes it and buy a new boost for character
[21:48:11] atowellthatiallreadyused: he got high amount of autism etc
[21:48:12] elvia_: at least your friend is cap at 10 tokens per weak
[21:48:24] elvia_: week
[21:48:35] Draco_wolfstein: micro transactions have been successful for along time
[21:48:38] mainstree: Can i ask as outsider who doesn't play wow, what do wow community think of microsoft buying blizzard?
[21:48:40] denflup: per week
[21:48:59] atowellthatiallreadyused: but sadly ppl abuse him cause of hes diagnosises he have its really sad
[21:49:06] forcegamerrr: Hey, how's it going everybody?
[21:49:14] duffock: ive bought a few of the mount packs when they go on like black friday sale

[21:49:38] mainstree: @lalelusa D:

[21:49:57] MaybeRespect: is that the MoP cloak proc?

[21:50:51] gdtomii: @Kelsillium yup, its class specific, not spec
[21:51:16] Niksen_99: Would be a sick ending to a 24 hour stream if Towel got the mount on the very last dungeon LUL
[21:51:21] ShardyNator: can you solo Legion raids now? It's the only way i would come back to wow, nothing more, i cnat raid curent contnt, too much elitism around still

[21:59:04] zachaquacks: i honestly wish they would have kept the artifacts. felt weird getting such a power item and just throwing it in the bank
[21:59:09] Niksen_99: My biggest issue with WoW is the new race models looks so goofy when they are running
[21:59:15] Kelsillium: Should have kept artifact weapons as a standard system in the game since Legion imo
