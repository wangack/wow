[5:55:47] JJJnray1: how much damage does 60 armor reduce? if it reduces more than 30 dmg its the armor thats better
[5:55:47] Sevirit: NODDERS yes indeed
[5:55:49] melindeys: sta, mate
[5:55:50] Realskeel: @Sonadourge 30hp way more valuable at this level, especially on short fights like these mobs
[5:55:52] Summersdonna: but what if the mobs are casters hmm
[5:55:53] Fossabot: sodaHmm Did you know you get a free subscription when you link your Amazon Prime account with Twitch? You can sub to Chance for free and spam emotes all day! sodaH sodaL - https://gaming.amazon.com

[5:55:59] tommyp915: Hmm
[5:55:59] fudgement: useless against casters
[5:56:00] ArbiterCurly: so for every 100 HP you save 2 HP
[5:56:02] krimzin_wizard: @Novacht any game with hardcore has no appeal system. dont need it.
[5:56:02] dakodi_: what if the mobs use fireballs
[5:56:05] JOOOOEEEEY: can you use mage water from someone else in HC?
[5:56:05] ithod: 2% of 30 dmg xdd

[5:56:10] the_sun_also_rlses: Repeating of course
[5:56:10] Tinraya: we'd have to spreadsheet it out, but generally hp is better than armor in these games
[5:56:12] DeadnessTV: dmg reduction = less time spent healing
[5:56:13] Sonadourge: @Realskeel If it's a short fight stam doesn't do anything, armor reduces damage which saves time
