[2:52:13] travkc: nah a lot of us were already playing eq and games like that before
[2:52:17] ghsteo: WoW brought a lot of people into PC gaming
[2:52:18] DacePerado: It's possible, because there are so many more PC players, but the next expansions would have to be straight CurseLit to get anywhere near

[2:52:38] DacePerado: If this new saga is good, it might stand a chance

[2:52:56] ThatsRealNeato: didn't ffxiv overtake it?
[2:52:58] Wrenton: Truth... Right now the onmy thing that can make WoW better is competition  and IMHO FF14 has brought it.

[2:53:18] Ellie_Stark_: @Wrenton Yep, although per raid fight can make the tank ranking shift slightly apparently. It's on icyveins. Although mythic dungeons DH is top tier, everything else under it

[2:53:22] the_flatulent: the_flatulent subscribed with Prime. 
[2:53:22] freetherocktv: @DansGaming Microsoft said they are going to leave Blizzard alone and let them be an independent studio like they were back in the day. That is going to Blizzard be Blizzard again since they won't be answering to Activision's board anymore
[2:53:22] DacePerado: Let's hope the Microsoft acquisition is good for the game
[2:53:23] Johnd212: It's a lot of content for the cost

[2:53:52] NyteMann00: ah the days of being ganked in strangle thorn
[2:53:57] BOXakaJOEMOVES: Final Fantasy XI had a steep learning curve and was very grind heavy. But it was possibly the first game to feature crossplay between PS2 & PC

[2:54:25] Oarens: Guild Wars 2 needs some lovin danSad

[2:54:36] Grayfox3d: FF14 being on console really helps too
[2:54:38] KeyKnight: @elre__  a lot of people (this includes me) only was interested because of the movie lol
[2:54:41] BalaWulf: yeah, FFXIV from 2013 onward has had a pretty good storytelling and soundtrack
[2:54:42] 10dayfreetrial: i just did all these quests with my rogue
[2:54:42] KeyKnight: hii @Grayfox3d  danWave
[2:54:43] freetherocktv: @DacePerado Microsoft is letting Blizzard run themselves now so that's why things have already been good with Blizzcon and such going forward. No more Activision influence
[2:54:45] 10dayfreetrial: pain in the butt
[2:54:48] Wrenton: ...yet
[2:54:52] Grayfox3d: Ello! @KeyKnight
[2:54:59] Angryfist40: that might change
[2:55:01] bizzle44: COGGERS
[2:55:05] ThatsRealNeato: FFXI back in the day was still my favorite mmorpg
[2:55:11] NeonFlux: People enjoying hc wow and it being popular seems people like, a fresh start, a simple to get into mmo
[2:55:15] Grayfox3d: im 50/50 on coming back to WoW, but if it hits console, im 100% back on the menu
[2:55:18] elre__: @KeyKnight that's very true, only thing keeping it afloat was the Lord of the rings theme, most if not all of the content is free nowadays so def a good time to look into it i have alot of fun in it and is fantastic even solo danHype
[2:55:23] lexinora: @neoislost it has a higher active player count, but not nearly has many subs. the last count was only 41 million subs vs WoW at over 100 million. but active players is 1.3 million vs 1.2 for WoW
[2:55:30] DacePerado: @freetherocktv Yeah I heard, let's hope it goes well danYes I've not played WoW for years but would be awesome if the next expansions are great
[2:55:31] mattstrat350: i wish there was a way to change the gun sound to sound like a bow the gun is so loud lol
