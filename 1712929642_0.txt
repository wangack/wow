[1:56:31] Doohzyy: So many good dps specs as well. Way different than when I played shadowlands
[1:57:01] parad12e: good morning :)
[1:57:13] WaverlyP15: @LToblivious13 I have nothing good to say about monk heals, but that may have been because of the monk i ran with. id say your best bet would be windwalker, because they are insane right now
[1:58:28] Karalun_GG: Anyone know what that m+ timer WA is?
[1:58:32] Sollice: Survival should be removed
[1:58:35] WaverlyP15: id agree with that
[1:58:39] Sollice: Or made to be a true tank spec
[1:59:06] PvtHudson093: Ret needs some love because every melee can do what we but better
[1:59:07] Nerdmeat_: Yeah I like my class fantasy god dammit
[1:59:14] WaverlyP15: @Sollice but that one time survival was meta several xpacs ago lol
[1:59:20] PvtHudson093: just with utility not damage
[1:59:31] Shrenko: @PvtHudson093 Ret is in a really good spot now imo
[1:59:54] WaverlyP15: @PvtHudson093 ret is really good right now
[2:00:23] PvtHudson093: its not always about dps its the utility and survivability
[2:00:42] Shamwise: towHAMUP towHAMUP towHAMUP towHAMUP Morning all:)
[2:00:42] Sollice: @Sollice Survival was meta end of shadowlands with 4 piece bomb
[2:00:46] Rudric_Ice: do people not read patch notes ?
[2:00:57] asmodai4823: ret still a meme in m+
[2:01:15] WaverlyP15: @Sollice i think it had a meta in LK or BC as well
[2:01:16] Endin: yes you can with turtle
[2:01:42] gmike66: 4
[2:01:43] Sollice: @Sollice COuld be yeah. I just dont understand the point of the spec right now
[2:01:54] PvtHudson093: love to see a ret talent that when we cav charge it applies freedom at the same time
[2:02:21] WaverlyP15: @Sollice i literally havent understood the point of it since it was created
[2:02:30] citrinesoan: is this that one raid from Legion??
[2:02:59] g0n_z3n: @citrinesoan yes
[2:03:16] g0n_z3n: Dungeon not raid
[2:03:20] gmike66: upstairs is 16%
[2:03:38] kappaday23: Kappa
[2:03:41] dimofodi: Should work out to all wolves on right side, 4 bulls, 3 stags.
[2:03:47] PvtHudson093: the CD change to SoV was a good start for Ret
[2:03:49] hammack52: the thing with ret is it has just so many through put abilities

[2:10:48] Affiiance: A lot of different things will cause you to drop the shield
[2:11:03] timmypee10: you hit the shield a fraction too early
[2:11:36] Molvonos: @Towelliee You killed him while he was still channeling the fel bullshit, since it was a projectile in transit, you didn't have the shield to protect your group.
[2:11:38] Molvonos: So they died.
[2:11:45] Molvonos: Seems like a stupid ass bug
[2:11:54] twinkieruler95: @Towelliee i have a 16 court of stars

[2:14:48] rosina_scarlett: Bdk or Prot war rn
[2:14:56] im_capy: 10000000%
[2:15:04] KShellZx: i've been loving paladin this exp. so far
[2:15:05] Affiiance: Brewmaster is growing on me

[2:15:14] ArcaneMaki: It's the BUbbles plays!
[2:15:14] darkkilla1: i dont want to pick up warrior though because i have a feeling bliz is gonna tactical nuke them after this season
[2:15:19] Rudric_Ice: when was Prot actually good as a tank ? other than df obvi
[2:15:35] rosina_scarlett: @darkkilla1 then bdk or Prot pal
[2:15:43] rosina_scarlett: @Rudric_Ice begining of legion

[2:15:53] Lobby_WoW: prot felt good in SL CN raid
[2:16:07] rosina_scarlett: vanilla-wrath then Legion start
[2:16:27] darkkilla1: i cant be the only one though that has a feeling blizz is gonna wait to the end of the season to nerf the hell out of warriors for the next season
[2:17:11] BobLongMVP: I believe they’re just gonna buff all the other tanks. Nuclear prot war nerf could potentially backfire and alienate the entire warrior playerbase imo
[2:17:14] rosina_scarlett: I mean BDK was broken for 90% if legion, BFA and SL and never got nerfed much

[2:25:54] Rudric_Ice: air fryer is just a QOL
[2:25:56] chriswrites: i read a science study recently linking the high temperatures of air friers to crystals in the food that cause cancer. cant have shit in this world haha
[2:25:59] 91Niki: @molvonos check out the Ninja air fryers. Good stuff
[2:25:59] Sollice: @91Niki Yep. I use it almost everyday at this point. I havern't gotten adventurous enough though to do a steak on one.

[2:26:36] Sollice: @chriswrites You realize air fryers dont work because of high temps?
[2:26:39] raldrik: gotta love the concept of a chicken injection mold

[2:29:04] Sollice: I am going to Costco this weekend and going to buy a SHIT TON of chicken wings and bag them up for lunches. Throw them on the air fryer
[2:29:12] darkkilla1: i think i might have to buy one of these so called air fryers
[2:29:40] HaxzorJimDuggan: sister in law bought my mom an air fryer years ago, mom hates kitchen gadgets. I found it in a closet a few months ago and now I use it just about every day
[2:29:56] Molvonos: @Sollice I cant do that.  I'm too finicky about my wings.  They get baked first with salt and pepper to get the moisture out, then deep fried before being tossed with whatever i'm seasoning them with
[2:30:03] jarilrpg: @Towelliee has there been any talk of them actually increasing the timer on HoV to what it was in legion?
[2:30:04] Molvonos: I do too much homemade shit tho
[2:30:22] 91Niki: We also use the air fryer to toast bagels, comes out soo good.
[2:30:30] darkkilla1: why increase the timer when they can just pause it for RP
[2:30:44] Sollice: @Sollice I mean if I wanted to go nuts for superbowl I would dry brine overnight to crisp skin. Then bake, toss in something and then broil. I dont deep fry

[2:32:51] thebakeriscomingforu: explosive is a great job for a hunter
[2:33:01] WasomeWasTaken: first room 2 rooms on ruby always have extra pulls aswel..
[2:34:17] KaisenSiru: anniesWrite
[2:34:24] Molvonos: Yea, triple checked the clip.  No one fired off anything at the explosives.  The only potential pull condition was the HVH doing their AoE  and the outer perimeter somehow pulled.
[2:34:36] WasomeWasTaken: too often ppl die in swirlies or something xD
[2:34:59] KaisenSiru: Deadge
[2:35:01] 91Niki: Timing hahaha

[3:37:08] kappaday23: Kappa
[3:37:27] Fyxha: @Dagomarus not azure vault or hov
[3:37:31] iDeez88: I'd say 10 is high for a super casual, 14 is high for a casual but progressive player

[4:45:18] wEiRdO_dUdE: I heard someone say that this dungeon is the wall for tanks, like the biggest challenge with all the magic damage
[4:45:32] mavvy33: No it’s just the jade serpent strike. It literally can almost one shot tanks
[4:45:34] mavvy33: It’s silly

[4:54:26] SuperLost89: @Towelliee whisper Eico on illidan. I think he can recraft
[4:54:28] wEiRdO_dUdE: The charges should accumulate, or you can stack them over time, yeah
[4:54:47] Maruika: does catalyst gear keep the ilevel of the gear you use it on >

[4:59:51] Dox023: Fang does count
[4:59:53] flewid: depends
[4:59:55] Dox023: Pretty sure
[5:00:02] jarilrpg: pretty sure fang does count
[5:00:04] SC0REGASMS: fang is an embellishment
[5:00:07] jarilrpg: the food one does not
[5:00:14] SC0REGASMS: it's only the food one that doesn't count that you add
[5:00:20] snake_like: hope they bump up embellishment cap in 10.1
[5:00:23] ReignOfRa: the pocket dont count
[5:00:27] jarilrpg: it does
[5:00:29] WaverlyP15: still counts
[5:00:29] ReignOfRa: the fang does
[5:00:30] JordoOCE: They do
[5:00:32] iitzamomo: Still counts
[5:00:36] AndyBoyLIVE: flavor pocket doesnt count
[5:00:37] jarilrpg: wrong
[5:00:37] SC0REGASMS: you can just look at your weapon and if it says embellishment, it counts
[5:00:37] doublesidecar: It will say unique-equipped: embellished
[5:00:38] Snabido: Most crafted embellish count, surely?
[5:00:39] Ryvden: fang counts
[5:00:41] Tyran3k: your weapons says 2 emb
[5:00:44] Valzark: all added ones count
[5:00:46] TheOGDaywalker: hard getting my Devastation evoker invites past +15. Got 1800 IO, 394 ilvl
[5:00:53] AndyBoyLIVE: you need the dust from obsidian sanctum

[5:00:57] DigitalChill: oh hell yeah subarino, thanks!
[5:00:59] iitzamomo: Gotta pick 2.
[5:01:02] faulen: there is a emblishment that removes emblishments
[5:01:06] faulen: in recrafting
[5:01:08] ReignOfRa: you need a to by griftah embellisshemnt powder
[5:01:08] jokergtv: u can recraft it and remove it
[5:01:09] jordono176: flavor pocklet doesnt count as one
[5:01:12] Experiia: Theres a vendor in obsidian citadel that sells dust to remove it
[5:01:13] wEiRdO_dUdE: Yeah it's the dust from that one trader guy
[5:01:14] jordono176: pocket
[5:01:14] faulen: but it has a chacne to lower the quality
[5:01:15] doublesidecar: right click on the embellishment in recraft screen
[5:01:18] AndyBoyLIVE: you can buy the dust off a vendor
[5:01:19] flewid: you can recraft it and remove the embelishment
[5:01:21] wEiRdO_dUdE: Griftah

[5:01:26] Renritar: To remove an embellishment you just need to buy the powder off Griftah and put it in the order
[5:01:31] Renritar: That's what the internet says
[5:01:33] flewid: nice i didn't know there was dust
[5:01:47] Weirdsliceofbread: @towelliee hey bro new to the game and wanted to know what kind of addons do u recommend for raids and dungeons? Or anything in general
[5:01:51] snake_like: hate that you have to recraft just to remove an embellishment
[5:01:56] Kokugon: @Towelliee Thanks for the gift sub!
[5:02:26] Rudric_Ice: when u gonna get a boost for glad ?
[5:02:41] wEiRdO_dUdE: The catalyst is going to help a lot of people get their 2 set and 4 set
[5:03:06] Valzark: they said it was 6 from the start
[5:03:08] Renritar: Item to remove embelishment ----- Griftah's All-Purpose Embellishing Powder
[5:03:10] j_bar111: I have mythic shoulders from eranog i want to convert to teir
[5:03:22] Uutef: the catalyst is already gated at 1/week, it should have been up earlier
[5:03:59] flewid: but people with bad luck couldnt' rage out because they still only have 3 piece
[5:04:01] wEiRdO_dUdE: I agree the catalyst should have been up already
[5:04:29] Kanrad: Tightly forged hole?
[5:04:29] shimwood: Hopefully they have a quest to show you where it's at like the original catalyst
[5:04:30] Snabido: Honestly thought that Engine of Innovation area would be the place for it
[5:04:34] Snabido: in the city
[5:05:01] wEiRdO_dUdE: "group activities" ugh
[5:05:11] Kanrad: Gotta be a login popup for anyone with DF and at 70
[5:05:20] j_bar111: bread crumb quest to take you to the catalyst
[5:05:21] j_bar111: ?
[5:05:26] wEiRdO_dUdE: It's like they keep forgetting about solo players entirely
[5:05:27] khronicz: So much room for group activities
[5:05:47] shimwood: Maybe over by the Maiden
[5:05:54] Snabido: Vault 👀
[5:06:01] Kanrad: has to be the average wow player might not even be aware of this feature so they have to make sure to present it on login day

[5:07:11] Heero_Effect: 1 charge for account or character?
[5:07:12] EvenstarTV: 4 mythic runs POGGERS
[5:07:21] SuperLost89: character
[5:07:24] wEiRdO_dUdE: If you can kill a bunch of rares for a charge, that might be alright
[5:07:29] SuperLost89: you get 1 per week
[5:07:36] SuperLost89: but you can use it once per character
[5:07:48] Rudric_Ice: wtf
[5:07:54] Rudric_Ice: only one
[5:07:57] Heero_Effect: towClap
[5:07:57] Lilurrn: you get a charge per char
[5:07:59] faulen: Wait so you cannot get tier on an alt?
[5:08:00] Kanrad: will the new elemental storm events give cataylest experiance I wonder
[5:08:07] Snabido: Do you mind opening a nice item from your ptr vault 😏
[5:08:44] SuperLost89: you get 1 charge per week, but you can use that charge for each character. so all of your alts get 1 total a week
[5:09:27] cidthesloth420: wait its up?
[5:09:40] Uutef: @cidthesloth420 its ptr
[5:09:58] Kanrad: yeah lots of casual ways to get it other than 5man+ content
[5:10:13] cidthesloth420: @cidthesloth420 uhhh
[5:10:19] cidthesloth420: ty
[5:10:39] Masqerader: lol 5%, don't those take forever to spawn
[5:10:39] wEiRdO_dUdE: 10% from grand hunts would be good, yes
[5:10:51] Snabido: More hunts PogChamp
[5:10:52] Rudric_Ice: go to LFR and AFK EZ
[5:11:07] Jared702: towBlind
[5:11:13] TialePetit: @Masqerader I believe I read that they are increasing the spawn rate of those
[5:11:19] wEiRdO_dUdE: 10 solo shuffles is not too horrible for PvP guys
[5:11:31] mrrazputin: on all
[5:11:32] SuperLost89: each character gets 1 charge
[5:11:35] ZeusDNA: Yeah each character gets a charge
[5:11:38] Kanrad: yeah is it a shared charge or indevidual
[5:11:49] WaverlyP15: from what i understand each character gets a charge
[5:11:54] Rudric_Ice: 10 is a lot for solo shuffle
[5:11:55] camarac: every character gets a charge, even ones you create in the future
[5:12:00] ZeusDNA: Yeah super easy
[5:12:03] SuperLost89: seems good
[5:12:08] mavericks312: i like it were gonnabe doing keys anyway
[5:12:12] Kanrad: Well good on me cause I have all the classes at max level so there is that
[5:12:17] wEiRdO_dUdE: The grand hunts make it accessible for all players, that's a good thing
[5:12:23] zilzihan: 7 toons needs 4 charges each
[5:12:33] dracullus: I wonder how many loot from world content is eglible, in 9.2 only 246 gear for currency was
[5:12:37] Lilurrn: so what about valop cap removal?
[5:13:03] shimwood: It'll always be the Creation Catalyst to me, just like Sears Tower LUL
[5:13:04] mavericks312: valor cap will be removed probably 0.7
[5:13:19] wEiRdO_dUdE: Yeah the only question left is about the sources of gear that can be used in the catalyst
[5:13:20] Moobot:  Check out Towelliee's YouTube channel! You can view the most recent uploaded video HERE || Huge Mythic Dungeon NERFS?! - WoW News youtu.be/E5e_yQcTBQw
[5:13:20] WaverlyP15: i dont want removal, but mabe double
[5:13:23] dracullus: probably in 9.2.7, I think island will be big catch up for s1
[5:13:27] dracullus: 10.0.7*
[5:13:29] ZeusDNA: I'd say 6 weeks or so
[5:13:40] xHukk: Instead of worrying about the valor cap, maybe..  Go outside.  check out the Rays and get some IRL experience.
[5:13:42] ZeusDNA: They already said what gear can be used for catalyst in the patch note
[5:13:52] WaverlyP15: maybe double, becaus for armor or weps you can get 1 upgrade max if you use your valor each week
[5:14:00] wEiRdO_dUdE: Presumably we can use world boss gear that never drops in the catalyst, but we need to be able to use crafted gear and gear from those elite WQ's at least
[5:14:00] camarac: 10.1 is a new raid, so it would have to happen for 10.0.7 or not at all
[5:14:11] Lilurrn: How are the sparks going to work after next weeks last timegated week?
[5:14:29] snake_like: maybe when hall of fame closes if it comes before 10.0.7
[5:14:43] ottavianni: so best play this week if u have 2piece is to get a 3rd and the 4th next week whe the catalist is live ?
[5:15:18] mutant21: magic legs lt. dan
[5:15:25] Rudric_Ice: u goona try guardian drood next week ?
[5:15:27] dschmidt: @Lilurrn you complete the last quest and then are granted a "buff" to find the bottled essences from "harder content". ie. they are rare drops from dungeon completions, rares etc.
[5:15:43] WaverlyP15: HOV and Not good
[5:15:53] GingerGambit: Hov
[5:16:16] Keglett: I got a 21 TJS
[5:16:18] xghostyyx: Blood BiS is Algethar i think
[5:16:21] WaverlyP15: not good is technically bis for legs, atleast prot warr
[5:16:22] iitzamomo: 18 RLP ssorry
[5:16:27] ZeusDNA: @wEiRdO_dUdE Crafted and renown gear cannot be used in catalyst
[5:16:56] pereadin: I'm down for eitheer or
[5:17:07] kimmo_gaming: what the hell with tmog roulette LOL
[5:17:11] Lilurrn: stats dont matter bc the outcome pc in catalyst is whatever the tier slot stats are
[5:17:25] Keglett: guzzle guzzle
[5:17:42] freakwidit: They should be Mocked
[5:17:48] JiberishUI: how do you and Pereadin know eachother @Towelliee

[5:18:30] WaverlyP15: @mrrazputin yeah did it last night and had to type out the entire fight, did it in an hour though
[5:18:40] wEiRdO_dUdE: If catalyst-eligible gear is gated behind group or PvP content, that sucks

[5:20:55] xghostyyx: Tier set goat set

[6:22:06] Strange_Inquiries: Secondary market for pokemon is really good and stable, so they are selling like hot cakes
[6:23:18] Strange_Inquiries: They are making great choices and not doing insane amount of reprints for their sets which maintains value rather well for sealed sets.

[6:25:36] daconcion: Yeah
[6:25:40] daconcion: Very fast
[6:25:40] wickedmgg: it saves having to run through the buildings and stuff
[6:26:19] AlphasaurusRexx: i dont see where the time save is. a couple seconds maybe imo
[6:26:34] daconcion: I think an avg of 1 min
[6:26:39] daconcion: assuming a fast character
[6:27:01] Velarn435: How are you skipping the dialog windows so quickly?

[6:46:51] daconcion: I don't tank, % isn't my problem
[6:46:57] jurden_1: 94% and you're good
[6:47:11] AlphasaurusRexx: you need ~93.7 ish before coming up here
[6:47:13] CeruleanStar: @smashwow thanks i haven't used bigwigs in a while lol
[6:47:35] CeruleanStar: but something that auto selects dialogue and shows the clues and such would be great lol
[6:47:47] mo_dilly84: Out of curiousity is there somewhere you can see what your ilvl should be for the different mythic dungeons. Been having a hard time getting invited to even 2's but have completed multiple 4-5's and have an ilvl of 372 as an arcane mage
[6:48:10] smashwow: well bigwigs / littlewigs
[6:48:15] Dcarter: HoV rp as well
[6:48:18] Dcarter: fuck that rp
[6:48:34] smashwow: RP in general in M+ can suck it
[6:48:47] daconcion: HoV is the worst unless you use the mug trick on the 4 adds

[6:52:49] smashwow: the fact even from 11 to 13 you're spending 1200 valor for that one slot is extremely rough

[6:53:34] BroffelofTV: will it keep the secondary stats with cataclyst ?
[6:53:37] Coleson54: do we think blizz will increase valor cap sooner rather than later?
[6:53:53] smashwow: @BroffelofTV it'll get a different item id
[6:53:57] Clinucal: i hope so
[6:54:07] smashwow: secondary would change but sockets would stay
[6:54:26] reggiepowa: it is too early into the season for uncapped valor
[6:54:27] smashwow: blizz doesn't want to give us a way to actually gear differently than raid
[6:54:35] BroffelofTV: so it will change to the fixed set item ?
[6:54:37] warrenny: Thought they were removing it with 10.0.5
[6:54:55] warrenny: Gear shouldnt be account wide
[6:55:02] smashwow: you can degen a raid and be 415 in a week but degen M+ and badly get 410
[6:55:11] citrinesoan: sup towellie how ya doing?
[6:55:11] DenghisKhann: Wait so, the gear upgrades next week, I thought it was account wide? Is it not?
[6:55:13] CMack_72: I'm a mouse in a maze and when I pull the lever I get a piece of gear
[6:55:17] heltvild: it can be fun for end of expansion again like season 4, catalyst uncapped week 1 and valor uncapped
[6:55:18] jarilrpg: i think at 8 weeks into the season they should uncap valor
[6:55:27] DanceAtTheMoonlight: @smashwow  hardly disagree
[6:55:29] daconcion: My only thing is I think the Titan Training Modules should be BoA
[6:55:29] DanceAtTheMoonlight: very very hardly
[6:55:30] pereadin: yeah i'd play more and level more if they uncapped valor
[6:55:42] daconcion: Since they only go to M0 content anyways
[6:55:43] DanceAtTheMoonlight: i got 1 piece from raid and ia m 417 ... everything else is from vault / crafting / ugprading
[6:55:52] NetherRegion: Man, in a perfect world
[6:55:56] thebakeriscomingforu: pretty much why i cap myself to just a few characters. If it was easier I'd have more. lol
[6:56:01] Fi9e: after i got my gear i can finally play the game. but looks like not in this season
[6:56:11] reggiepowa: I'm one of the people who would probably quit the game if I got all the gear I can too fast
[6:56:16] misjonarka: What are you thoughts on Ruby Whelp Shell trinket on warrior tank?
[6:56:22] Skylin3r: towHAMUP towHAMUP towComfy
[6:56:28] warrenny: Why should they
[6:56:31] DenghisKhann: What would hardcore players get to show off then if everyone had the gear
[6:56:39] smashwow: @DanceAtTheMoonlight so you're saying you can't go through heroic/mythic win your rolls and not be geared in an hour vs all the work to get less gear in M+ with more weekly gating?
[6:56:59] smashwow: that's the whole reason RWF raiders to splits
[6:57:04] Maruika: so your saying!!!!! stfu
[6:57:05] reggiepowa: and then a new patch drops
[6:57:06] khrovaa: i love playing alts, but i always feel i need my main geared first, as a casual who pugs heroic and m+15s it takes awhile
[6:57:12] Keglett: flexing your gear in 2023
[6:57:21] smashwow: do*
[6:57:21] DanceAtTheMoonlight: @smashwow  never happens ~ you dont get raid gear stuffed in your A.s  and if you do by then you can also upgrae  valor stuff to 415
[6:57:28] Clinucal: also the looting for raid just isnt far at all. like 2 pieces for 14 people? just doesnt seem fair
[6:57:32] DenghisKhann: Im new to retail :P So I didnt experience it in the past. I came from classic and have been loving DF so not use to getting spoon fed gear LUL
[6:57:37] daconcion: Raz mount is available in LFR
[6:57:45] Clinucal: fair"
[6:57:51] warrenny: As long as they dont adhere to the wrong casuals
[6:57:57] smashwow: @DanceAtTheMoonlight maybe you haven't experienced it but it definitely does happen.
[6:58:03] DanceAtTheMoonlight: @smashwow  at this point if you run like 40x  16-20 keys  you can get basically to 413-415 in  1 1/2 week if you got time
[6:58:07] Maruika: i run a few mythics a week, and im 387 ilevel. casual alert
[6:58:09] thebakeriscomingforu: Only things that are truely restricted is some titles and mounts. Same it has been for a long time.
[6:58:10] smashwow: look at the ilvl curve from wk1 to wk2 for groups that funnel gear
[6:58:13] KippaChaos: That is fair. No need to be able to be one of the best just by buying lv 60 chars LUL
[6:58:15] DanceAtTheMoonlight: @smashwow  in hc/nhc sure sure
[6:58:30] Skahdoosh: Can anyone explain blizzards concept behind having mythic rating caps to upgrade gear? if you're already at a weekly valor cap?
[6:58:32] DanceAtTheMoonlight: @smashwow  but not mythic bc that is all regulated by basically masterloot/ RCLootcouncil
[6:58:44] ronny_84: thanks towel.. we love you
[6:58:59] DanceAtTheMoonlight: gn8 towel
[6:59:00] smashwow: gear funneling happens in mythic too
[6:59:09] BlueBlurPrime: wish i was 400 ilvl
[6:59:12] smashwow: gear goes to your performers so you can kill content
[6:59:17] Bawpears: What about 397-398?
[6:59:17] Keglett: Peace Tow
[6:59:19] DanceAtTheMoonlight: @smashwow  and costs millions of gold
[6:59:22] Voltaictv: If we have aotc, can we bring an alt thats under 400?
[6:59:27] koko316: towHAMUP towHAMUP towHAMUP
[6:59:34] NetherRegion: towBeer towHAMUP
[6:59:46] DanceAtTheMoonlight: @smashwow  and ye sure happens but those who are funneled are always those wo are the top players anyway  ~ and if you are a top player running your 22 keys and doing nr.1 top dps then you should get the gear
[6:59:59] DanceAtTheMoonlight: @smashwow  surely it does happen and if you buy stuff its easier to gear through raid
[7:01:10] DanceAtTheMoonlight: @smashwow but at this point and time most of ppl i play with me inc.luded do not need raid gear ~  first 4 bosses drop throwaway gear besides  tier set ... that is easily dropable in vault ... and the last 4 bosses have also many trash items you dont need
[7:02:05] DanceAtTheMoonlight: @smashwow  its very likely that you are in the 6th week like me (  its 6th week or ? ) and you are 417 nearly 418 and only saw 1 item from raid  xD ... and thats an item i am gonna replace when  T-set Gloves drop  ... so yee ~ kinda lucky but thats also why i was doing 20s week 1
[7:02:35] DanceAtTheMoonlight: and its not like we dont have boss kills we are at Diurna now xD
