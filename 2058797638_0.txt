[0:33:38] Sillken: ive killed it like 10 times and got it this week too
[0:33:41] M4dmanGG: LFR, Normal, Heroic every week
[0:33:50] qabraa: is this boost ?
[0:33:50] chromaxen: @bowieduh  gz bro thats dedication
[0:33:52] infernion: Are we playing SOD
[0:33:52] bokioz: you can make alts, and spam
[0:33:57] Fredschen: xD
[0:33:58] bowieduh: no it doesnt
[0:33:59] n0tDef1ned: i killed it once and didn't get it
[0:34:01] noggetxx: LFR
[0:34:01] Loadedmvp: no it doesnt
[0:34:11] sparta_oli: Hvis du klarer HC får du også % chancen fra LRF og normal
[0:34:11] Fredschen: i mean u caould do it just makes no sense
[0:34:13] fr0z3n_rulz: @kruzefix warr + dh + rd
[0:34:14] Fredschen: no
[0:34:15] Woottodoo: If you do it on HC, the previous difficulities does not matter
[0:34:16] heroo24: i never killed it and still dont have it :(
[0:34:16] Explicitiz: gnomeregan is back
[0:34:18] bowieduh: yes u can
[0:34:21] Faxetwitch: The higher difficulty the higher drop chance
[0:34:21] dangen86: highest only
[0:34:22] Fredschen: the highes always counts
[0:34:25] muneplays: 1 Chacne each week highest difficulty highest chance
[0:34:28] virth123: more chance or highest difficulties
[0:34:29] peestii: if u run heroic, doing normal and lfg doesnt counts
[0:34:30] sparta_oli: Der er bare større chance fra HC end LFR og normal
[0:34:31] Craives: highest counts all the below
[0:34:34] Echo_Esports: Grab your fantastic new Displates for up to 33% off! Use echogg.ly/displate/Whaazz and enter code: ECHO
[0:34:36] noggetxx: They unlocked it on Mythic. But now U cant get that legendary axe on LFR and other diff
[0:34:42] Loadedmvp: you even get more bad luck for killing all bosses
[0:34:43] whatcanbedone: highest only
[0:34:44] jaggermanjensenx: hey @Whaazz what are some good warr comps rn?
[0:34:53] jesustakethewheels: cant get on LFR
[0:35:09] Explicitiz: u can get on lfr
[0:35:09] Moobot: Anyone who gifts 5 Subscribers can choose a Spec of my "Geared Classes" to play in Shuffle until the next person gifts 5 Subs.
[0:35:10] bowieduh: you gotta do LFR -> normal -> -> heroic if u want it to work
[0:35:15] bowieduh: cant do heroic then normal
[0:35:15] sparta_oli: Hvis du klarer full cler får du også "bad lock" tokens, som gir dig større chance ved fyrak
[0:35:17] PacoTacoMMMGood: no u can do it all difficulties. the only thing that is different, is the item drop that increases ur chance for the item drop. my guildmate killed it on heroic then got it on the normal run
[0:35:18] Explicitiz: lfr alrdy dropped 2
[0:35:19] Fredschen: there is a chance u get an item that shoudl increase the chance
[0:35:23] Fredschen: but i doubt that
[0:35:25] virth123: i just did LFR and HC last boost and got it after 7weeks
[0:35:33] daarkstarx: you get lesser shard from other bosses
[0:35:38] Faxetwitch: The % from LFR and normal adds up to the HC if u just do the HC
[0:35:42] Woottodoo: @Whaazz the other heroic/mythic bosses have a chance of dropping lesser embers, that increase ur chance a little bit, but those can only be obtained in HC/mythic
[0:35:45] PacoTacoMMMGood: yes
[0:35:45] bowieduh: people are so clueless
[0:35:48] PacoTacoMMMGood: correct
[0:36:00] Explicitiz: all this nonsense from chat
[0:36:05] bowieduh: you get lesser embers only from HC bosses, but greater ember from fyrakk on all difficulties
[0:36:10] M4dmanGG: You can do LFR first, then Normal, then HC.
[0:36:12] sparta_oli: You can only get the bad luck tokens on HC difficulty from all other bosses, it cant drop from LFR or normak
[0:36:21] norbertxnxx: !commands
[0:36:22] PacoTacoMMMGood: that item is what increases the chance, that is what u want at the higher lvl. meaning usually heroic cuz who has it on farm on mythic in reality. then do it on normal after with that item, is best chance
[0:36:36] Loadedmvp: @ The cumulative increase to your drop chances will now be available from all difficulties and will be directly represented by players receiving a Greater Ember of Fyr’alath when defeating Fyrakk. Additionally, defeating other encounters within Amirdrassil on Heroic or Mythic difficulty has a chance to award a Lesser Ember of Fyr’alath which will further attune you to the Shadowflame
[0:36:47] Sajko33: I swear those bad luck tokens are placebo
[0:36:48] PacoTacoMMMGood: just cumulates
[0:36:50] Fredschen: no just use and ur cchacne is 0,000001% higher
[0:36:51] PacoTacoMMMGood: a little
[0:36:54] bowieduh: no they just increase "lesser" as it says
[0:36:58] Sajko33: There's no indication on them that any of them work
[0:37:01] king_maasbo: wtf, who is lava lava
[0:37:02] Woottodoo: nah its unknown how much they increase the drop chance, so just a little bit
[0:37:20] virth123: i feel it
[0:37:22] virth123: its your time
[0:37:22] jugalosss: 100P
[0:37:30] Deathmarkedx: i know people with dozens of those that cant get the drop, its just pure rng
[0:37:59] heroo24: maybe u ate something wrong
[0:38:06] jugalosss: lissen after that kiss game shode reward you right now!
[0:38:11] Sajko33: Exactly. Our blood dk got in on week 1. Ret still doesnt have it today. Clearing every week. Its pure rng. Tokens or not
[0:38:14] flapperstv: skidSpit trenKiss
[0:38:14] bowieduh: id say, do lfr, normal then hc, cause lets say if you do hc, there is 3% chance u spin the wheel and u get it, or u can do it 3 times with a 1% chance, id say i rather do it 3 times
[0:38:58] dangen86: @bowieduh yeah if you wanna waste time sure... :D
