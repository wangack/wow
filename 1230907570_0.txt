[1:01:43] jeff6262: Rank 14 failure is not an option
[1:01:45] desrtdust: i doubt his server has enough pvper on horde to get enough ppl for bracket 1 spot

[4:58:02] Astrosparkle: DoTs are calculated on time of application. So if you somehow got like 2k Spell Power for 1s, as long as you casted Siphon Life in that window it would benefit from the 2k for the enitre duration until reapplied.
[4:58:04] howugetwoodz: using a trinket.  casting siphon life and maintain it up . will maintain it at the spell power you used originaly
[4:58:29] bpwnsALL: lol I remember when I found out he used a game pad I had to go out and buy one hit 2k in 2s and sold alot of aren carries back in the day ened up getting the swift special tiger from a guy for getting him to 2k
