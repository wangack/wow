[0:03:33] thesmeekq: 2v2
[0:03:38] rexxarhero4: you should see how asia made competitive games handle it, basically non existent
[0:03:45] rexxarhero4: these guys go EXTREMELY hard on anti cheat
[0:04:19] rexxarhero4: its also because in those countries many comp games are seen as national sports
[0:04:25] rexxarhero4: in europe/NA its seen as a video game KEKW
[0:05:15] rexxarhero4: there were 10m+ downloads for scripts in league in 2015 alone...
[0:05:19] GarrinchA: in south korea, you need ur ID linked to game accounts and if u cheat they even make you pay a ticket
[0:05:54] rexxarhero4: thats awesome, sweden ahead of the pack
[0:06:06] simstarx: vibee
[0:06:10] HeyImArty: hydraKit hello friend, how are we today

[0:08:10] infrex1: hello pojski
[0:08:26] rexxarhero4: probably dont abide by international law
[0:08:31] HeyImArty: because international law
[0:08:48] throwmasterlol: that probably owns on shit like itunes where you are actually not the owner and cannot give your music away
[0:08:52] GarrinchA: yeah, their laws say if you pay for something you are the owner of it, kinda happens the same with house renting and stuff like that
[0:09:06] HeyImArty: there are good russians tho hydraKit
[0:09:09] HeyImArty: obvs
[0:09:17] GarrinchA: communism things

[0:10:41] rexxarhero4: answer to problems in life is to just show the finger
[0:10:44] Delow5: what happened to the wow community man no one watching any streams anymore ‚òπÔ∏è
[0:10:45] rexxarhero4: beautiful metaphor
[0:10:58] rexxarhero4: @Delow5 lack of active pvp scene
[0:11:13] rexxarhero4: alot of casuals moved on to league/fortnite etc for their pvp itch
[0:11:58] Bick13: When Cata bro ?
[0:12:06] rexxarhero4: @Minpojke truly think a good solo shuffle mode with low que times could bring in lots of players
[0:12:11] rexxarhero4: even in older expacs

[0:12:18] alexanderyeah: is there a ladder somewhere to see for the arena brackets?
[0:12:56] rexxarhero4: the game is so fucking good
[0:12:58] Delow5: i think it will take off for cata once everyone gets off helldivers üòÖ
[0:13:00] rexxarhero4: just people cant reach it..
[0:13:41] rexxarhero4: takes me days to go from 60-70 now with heirlooms + 50% bonus xp KEKW
[0:13:47] rexxarhero4: and restedxp addon
[0:13:52] HeyImArty: would play if gearing an alt wasnt a 1¬Ω month process
[0:13:52] Moobot: playlist !socialmedias !photosynthesis !covenant !legendaries !conduits !stats !discord !macros !ui !specs !restodruid !awc !armory
[0:14:03] alexanderyeah: do you think more ppl will dip into cata than wotlk?
[0:14:33] raselsuggy: the nicest thing with pservers is that u get insta max lvl and its easy to get gear
[0:14:53] HeyImArty: If you were to start an alt now, you'd be geared with 1 month left of wotlk
[0:14:53] rexxarhero4: u think blizz is scared of people taking pvp gear into pve if they make it more accesible early in phase? @Minpojke
[0:14:55] HeyImArty: :^) good game
[0:14:56] Ripleyxz: @raselsuggy ye u just swipe and u full
[0:14:56] alexanderyeah: cata back in the day was really fun when they introduced rbgs
[0:14:58] fortchx: I think a lot of the warmane andys might actually go back to wotlk during cata, and theyre like half of the ladder
[0:15:02] accessdenn: i think cata is very alt friendly and you dont need rating to be geared
[0:15:04] fortchx: so will be really inactive I think
[0:15:05] raselsuggy: i wouldnt bother learning new classes on classic
[0:15:08] raselsuggy: but on pservers its easy
[0:15:09] Aspmann: @raselsuggy A mode like on whitemane that you can boost pvp only characters would be good for classic arena too
[0:15:47] rexxarhero4: yeah i was thinking that too, idk if they can add that to classic engine tho
[0:16:08] accessdenn: that was implemented in mop
[0:16:43] HeyImArty: MoP had pvp power/resilience, ilvl scaling was WoD
[0:17:13] HeyImArty: MoP also introduced the massive bonus for having 2 pvp trinkets equipped
[0:17:18] raselsuggy: ye if we had that system
[0:17:19] accessdenn: yaeh but the pvp power rendered the pve gear useless
[0:17:21] raselsuggy: but we dont
[0:18:07] Moobot:  Welcome @borniflop HeyGuys thanks for subbing!

[0:19:13] rexxarhero4: that cant be real

[0:24:44] accessdenn: i know for a fact s9 and s10 will be fine
[0:24:57] GarrinchA: seems like ull need to change ur schedule to be able to face late night queuers :p
[0:25:08] utbiu: Why is it ass?
[0:25:12] yamzxc: wouldnt get a queue at this  hour in the top 0.0001% of cs2 either
[0:25:21] ekvilrogue: Hey Pojkeeeee! good morning! how are you? will you play with spottman today?
[0:25:27] accessdenn: a bit of hope i feel
[0:25:38] kenniflopper: Hey, anythings better than pserver population
[0:25:38] Kalimboo: You cant get a team lower than 500 mmr than your team, so unless a 2.9 team qs up you wont get qs for 30more minutes LUL
[0:26:22] yamzxc: na as a former sweaty cs gamer im certain of it, youd face a masssssive mmr disparity
[0:26:28] kenniflopper: i mean yeah kinda, but compare 3k pserver population to cata classic even if its "ultra dead"
[0:26:37] kenniflopper: cata classic will always have more people

[0:27:59] sisaso321: wow 27 min quee lol
[0:28:02] raselsuggy: i think it is true
[0:28:11] raselsuggy: what kalimbo said
[0:28:12] utbiu: 4k this week?
[0:28:18] toboYex: you could also smurf on low mmr, just roll a rogue and since its unplayable you will have a hard time climbing so you will get fast queues
[0:28:20] Kalimboo: @raselsuggy ofc its true
[0:28:24] brezkovtv: do u think they will make shadowlands classic and so on ?
[0:28:25] thisisarma: HeyGuys
[0:28:26] raselsuggy: i had 15 min queue once
[0:28:58] GarrinchA: @brezkovtv they better stop with mop
[0:29:00] kenniflopper: i just dont see a world where cata classic will ever have less than 10k players overall, so for a pserver players pov thats a win regardless
[0:29:11] kenniflopper: but ofc on launch its gonna be really populated
[0:29:28] yamzxc: @kenniflopper theres like 200k playing wotlk classic so ofc not less than 10k cata
[0:29:49] raselsuggy: have u looked at ironforge statistics lately
[0:29:52] raselsuggy: on how many people are playing wotlk
[0:29:52] kenniflopper: Legion Classic Pog
[0:29:54] raselsuggy: its scary low
[0:29:56] raselsuggy: cause of sod
[0:30:07] Azorktv: what kind of a psycopath would want warlords
[0:30:20] GarrinchA: arena activity maybe ?
[0:30:24] raselsuggy: ye
[0:30:25] kenniflopper: 193k players
[0:30:35] raselsuggy: but thats eu + na
[0:31:01] notmorbos: its not just sod. were in the 17th id of icc or smth and thats what most people do
[0:31:02] kenniflopper: so still more playing wrath, didnt expect that
[0:31:11] ChendTV: raid logs
[0:31:13] notmorbos: theyre based on warcraftlogs parses
[0:31:31] puxapuxaa: just wait to see cata numbers LUL
[0:31:44] pinatairl: on first time tbc didnt cold snap reset gcd
[0:31:45] Shazzie17: check sod a few weeks back
[0:31:58] ChendTV: they have more people raiding not playing
[0:32:02] Kalimboo: @kenniflopper 193k characters, not the same as 193k players
[0:32:07] ChendTV: probably  half the people that play sod have not done gnomer

[0:32:17] julbee: dads havent gotten to max lvl yet in sod to raid
[0:32:25] kenniflopper: @Kalimboo isnt it just the amount of players online?
[0:32:46] kenniflopper: na
[0:32:49] Fiftyswen: thats the amount of characters that logged in 1 week
[0:32:53] Kalimboo: no it's the number of characters who raided, it's based from warcraft logs
[0:32:55] kenniflopper: i think u cant look further back than 2 months
[0:32:55] matgr1993: people don't have 5 alts to raid in this phase, 90% is raiding with just 1 character and the other 10% with 2... in Phase 1 , people were raiding iwth 5 chars
[0:33:03] brezkovtv: SoD is boring af
[0:33:07] Aspmann: If it's based on logs then it's not even players. It's just who did  the raid once and might have quit by now
[0:33:09] kenniflopper: wait im confused

[0:43:13] kenniflopper: i got them from @raselsuggy
[0:43:19] burningtruths: WoW players are very prone to spend (a lot) of money into the game; so it's a pretty good bet that the cheating industry is profitable

[0:51:10] BroyWonder: fps says  fukdemkidz Kappa
[0:51:10] Superii1: GDPR is to protect personal information
[0:51:12] n0rrmaN: I guess they can't create software scanning your computer for unrelated services
[0:51:21] Superii1: any info that can be connected to a person directly
[0:51:26] notmorbos: i mean valorant has likely the most effective anticheat currently. partly due to kernel level software (although more games use that than most people know), but mostly due to great work in riots end
[0:51:27] hellners: or indirectly
[0:51:41] notmorbos: its a constant battle between cheaters and devs and it costs great ressources to do it well
[0:51:45] burningtruths: there's smth on battle net tho that is checked by default, where you authorise to share your in game data to 3 party app
[0:51:50] burningtruths: idk if that's the same thing
[0:52:09] Superii1: Yeah not when people play at home. Cos these are personal computers. If wow would be sold with a computer that is only used for wow

[0:53:26] WinGarbo: thats such a poor take
[0:53:28] Spottman: the thing is u can use a second computer to put the cheat on and link it to ur main pc so there isn't anything on ur main pc thats the main things on FPS rn
[0:53:29] notmorbos: well gdpr is more about how that information about you is stored and what you can do about it

[5:05:10] Azmoddan: @jamminlove In terms of loot, making and then breaking a clear in-game agreement on the way loot will be distributed by a Master Looter can be considered a scam. Unfortunately, some players will make loot agreements they have no intention of keeping to get players to join a dungeon or raid group. In these situations, players who disregard the original agreement and then take (or give away) loot in a different way are potentially violating our Scam Policy. @devzyx
[5:05:10] jamminlove: If you state rules in chat and then ninja if someone reports you its ban ban
