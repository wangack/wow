[0:13:07] Tal_NeonFlame: there are many guilds that run gnomer almost daily
[0:13:18] Tal_NeonFlame: so scheduling shouldnt be an issue then
[0:13:19] Speyto: Yo whats up

I told him how cool it was to meet him in person, but I didn’t want to be a douche and bother him and ask him for photos or anything. He said, “Oh, like you’re doing now?” I was taken aback, and all I could say was “Huh?” but he kept cutting me off and going “huh? huh? huh?” and closing his hand shut in front of my face. I walked away and continued with my shopping, and I heard him chuckle as I walked off.

[1:24:49] Studiovirtanen: Owned little mage
[1:24:49] prodigy_wow: The whole point of classic is to be overtuned in the open world. the imbalanced style is fine

[1:25:00] millinoid: the unbalanced shitshow is what makes the game fun anyway
[1:25:08] hobbehesu: Those 4 people gave up
[1:25:09] davedobbs: i think skirmishes should be available, but no ranked. game is too unstable
[1:25:10] hulkdieselx: they could literally just limit CC duration to 10s and call it a day right there. why complicate it further

[2:13:30] Backs1to: vanq sword is biss now for offhand
[2:13:32] Bishox: since the last updated
[2:13:33] Seoken1: Its BIS when you have the Mek mainhand + Cog offhand + Bonkmasters
[2:13:38] Backs1to: cuz of 30 ap
[2:13:42] Seoken1: if you just have cog offhand its a downgrade basically
[2:13:42] bakerpls: im guessing your weaponskill with fists are up to par YEP
[2:13:47] mealtiime: wideVIBE
[2:13:48] Bishox: attack power

[2:14:09] bakerpls: sick AP
[2:14:13] hotmanpop: it's because you dont need the same type of weapons anymore as well

[2:14:54] jemmis: MH: Still epic fist. OH: Cogmaster fist is still best, Vanq comes really close after (1-3dps)
[2:14:55] Seoken1: yeah I have been switching between Lego sword/Vanq sword/Cog/Ultrasonic vibro, they are all super similar tbh
[2:15:00] SpaceCowboy0811: on crusader strike NA i swear Horde is 90% Hunters and Shams
[2:15:08] jemmis: WSG revered sword
[2:15:11] Bishox: ashen pretty sure yeah
[2:15:24] Seoken1: You want Force of the Hypograph mainhand + cogmasters or ultrasonic vibroblade offhand as an orc IMO
[2:15:27] liamsorta: sims still showing cog is +5~ over vanq
[2:15:28] cynnx_crypto: hi i got stuck in a booba stream loop but finally managed to arrive, im proud of myself

[2:16:56] crumb321: booba is for plebs, this is a crack-stream
[2:17:02] jemmis: @Backs1to ur just wrong brother

[2:18:09] flakzcs: duppy man
[2:18:17] Bishox: BOMBACLATT
[2:18:19] liamsorta: @JUMJUMnoMi what?
[2:18:21] Seoken1: ideally you want to open at range with the gun, then switch to the bloodlash bow when in melee
[2:18:27] Seoken1: to be optimal

[2:52:54] inspect4: @Crazydevil2020 chat is on fire
[2:52:56] BsG_Bigbudz: By far the best genre.
[2:52:56] hobbehesu: LUL the pug experience
[2:53:02] Crazydevil2020: Like 6 times on last boss
[2:53:03] Gregzoid: top 3 as fire mage? but fire mage is top 1 dps
[2:53:06] gryn: Awow streamer who actually plays good rap music...no wait the only one EZ CLAP
[2:53:10] cudaprime1: Less than 3 and is MONKATOS
[2:53:10] Duleriumm: 6 is fair

[2:53:29] jhk97: not that it matters
[2:53:30] dissarray595: at 6 yeah gg
[2:53:33] Curtsy: six wipes with no sign if improvment means auto leave
[2:53:35] Beertje90: mike if you're seeing this hope you're doing well my brother
[2:53:41] Crazydevil2020: I lost all my consumes anyway🤣
[2:53:43] phaydeaway: leaving after first wipe is the true retail experience
[2:53:44] grylz89: Blows my mind ppl can kill menagerie but get hard stuck on therma
[2:53:44] probeu: people that leave after 1 wipe are the worst
[2:53:47] ClownCompany: Leaving on first wipe GIGACHAD
[2:53:48] hotmanpop: YEP cringe af
[2:53:48] JUMJUMnoMi: people say im in hurry I have work, like nobody does and will chat for 20-30 min like everybody else is trash
[2:53:48] ankerisx: what if its 4 wipes but you're progressing
[2:53:48] darsoldis: 6 wipes with no progress is gg
[2:53:51] Eliteqtlol: My rule of thumb is 3 wipes im gone.
[2:54:00] jhk97: leaving early is a little blacklist
[2:54:00] Crazydevil2020: And got told I'm parsing but no one dps enough on boss
[2:54:05] guztawo: dont leave nonetheless, how u gonna find a new grp for the bosses LOL
[2:54:07] DJC_: 2 hour on first boss minimum
[2:54:10] Crazydevil2020: I understand ty
[2:54:25] give_me_a_1_in_chat: sod is one worst playerbases ive ever engaged with in the history of this game
[2:54:30] Curtsy: @guztawo you just wait until reset bro lol who cares
[2:54:35] Crazydevil2020: And also I'm a new raider
[2:54:37] slurmoholic: slurmoholic subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 4 months! 
[2:54:39] phaydeaway: last boss is so easy if people just focus on mechanics.  but too many zug zug players
[2:54:41] darsoldis: First BFD my pug wiped like 15 times on dust 2 dust.. but we were making progress until 12-13
[2:54:51] Eliteqtlol: @give_me_a_1_in_chat thats just wow in general lets be honest
[2:54:53] Crazydevil2020: True
[2:54:57] pbj_time: i love the little robot monotone that comes out when the robot alerts
[2:55:07] weyachi: Are you not using axe? @ziqoftw
[2:55:07] Bishox: dust to dust PepeLaugh
[2:55:10] paco__gutierrez: @give_me_a_1_in_chat what server you on? server matters
[2:55:12] Crazydevil2020: Last phase  half health him like 3 times
[2:55:15] akonel89: Requires 3 people with half a brain to click buttons Shruge
[2:55:16] give_me_a_1_in_chat: @Eliteqtlol nah sod is definitely a different breed of unbearable
[2:55:24] snorkeltime: usually people who hate teh community in this game are just awful players
[2:55:25] paco__gutierrez: crusader strike is a hot mess of unbearable cunts
[2:55:27] Curtsy: If there's multiple wipes with no sign of improvement then you should leave, if they are making progress then stay a couple more
[2:55:30] The_Boomslang: @give_me_a_1_in_chat Agreed
[2:55:31] Duleriumm: but after 6 wipes who get consumes left like faps and shit xD
[2:55:35] Gregzoid: so what caused the wipe in last phase? bombs getting out of control or?
[2:55:37] aftermark: dependso also on the overall attitude othe raid. if people are flaming and pointing fingers, kills motivation to continue playing with them
[2:55:45] jhk97: we ninjapulled last boss yesterday and killed it with 2 dead from the start, 8 minute fight xd
[2:55:46] layziep: ziqoJAM
[2:55:46] Crazydevil2020: Ya I can't find a good casual good in crusader strike its all sweats :(
[2:55:48] JUMJUMnoMi: @darsoldis did you really ''Try'' 12 times there's no way your pug raid used consumes every try, hence TRASH trys straight to garbago, if you think that's progress that just lazy raiders expecting the lucky throw
[2:55:51] Crazydevil2020: On horde
[2:55:52] gothiqqx: jesus christ i had no idea ziqo was a god at pvp and a god with music taste
[2:55:57] probeu: thats all of wow every version lol
[2:56:06] Byggareebob: if ur struggling on last boss ever just buy FAP and fap frost phase and its unwipeable.
[2:56:06] RollinSpinnas: I know youre one of the best wow players and all. But its insane that you play with friendly nameplates on LOL. Hope you doin good today
[2:56:11] asddyo: i want to thank you for that video you posted about finding groups on SoD my server lfg chat actually changed and people was more open to accept anyone for gnomer
[2:56:18] wild_y0shi: whats the runes for pvp mr @Ziqoftw ???
[2:56:32] Eliteqtlol: idk playing wow for 17 years, just use to the commuinty at this point no matter how toxic.

[3:41:34] zak618: fap and melee on sheep for 30s is big
[3:41:34] timeoutandy: yes but isnt that a good reason to actually check logs if u wanna do 6/6 so u dont have bad setups or to long raid that ppl leave
[3:41:40] Curtsy: @Icecube64X you only need to pay the sub fee if you play classic only, there's nothign else to buy

[3:52:33] jhk97: NA*
[3:52:34] timeoutandy: @JUMJUMnoMi  LUL
[3:52:37] FIREMAGZZ: Leavers literally forced me to raid with a guild like it was 2007
[3:52:39] Korvynah: how are you
[3:52:44] Korvynah: hows the stream going
[3:52:45] timeoutandy: ziqo can u show healing meters
[3:52:52] weyachi: what weapons are you using ziqo? 󠀀
[3:52:54] nwjames1310: Yea we had a healer leave after first boss yesterday because he said grp was trash we 1 shot all th bosses after that lol he's a dumbass
[3:53:03] JUMJUMnoMi: druid is monkatos yeah go back boom
[3:53:04] AvengerDK: no wg?!? what
[3:53:12] sdotpuff: He can still spec wg and resto
[3:53:16] rainmannxz: OMEGALUL OMEGALUL OMEGALUL
[3:53:17] jhk97: @nwjames1310 i dont understand why people like that ever join pugs
[3:53:20] Sosatko: How do you not have WG loooool
[3:53:28] Perkasetz: WG is 95% of healing
[3:53:30] Perkasetz: pointless without
[3:53:32] DaaamnTV: respec angle ziqoLUL
[3:53:33] nwjames1310: Wild growth is a rune
[3:53:34] berryroot: wild growth is bis heal
[3:53:35] gia__: no WG at 40 is nuts
[3:53:44] sdotpuff: Wild growth is a rune..... Just put it on
[3:53:46] Yeti_Cave: that hurts
[3:53:47] Perkasetz: its a rune
[3:53:49] nwjames1310: Oh he's resto spec needs to be boomy spec
[3:53:49] mumfiezz: go 10 dps and trust the pump, full send faps
[3:53:51] AvengerDK: riiiiiiiiiiiiiiiip
[3:53:52] My_keI: Not a good case for inv random with no xp or pad parses
[3:53:54] Marcus2234: FeelsSadMan
[3:53:55] timeoutandy: "DC" Kappa
[3:53:55] zoombaaaa: this is why u check logs KEKW 󠀀
[3:53:59] rainmannxz: THE WIFE KEKW
[3:54:06] hothandzztcg: lol i hate pugs
[3:54:09] sdotpuff: Ohh he doesn't have WG rune... I get it. My bad
[3:54:10] JUMJUMnoMi: @sdotpuff he did get it is what it is, Ikr WG is a easy one to get
[3:54:11] snuuu: we have "the worst of the worst - the scum of azeroth" on our discord soundboard now. loving it
[3:54:29] jhk97: @hothandzztcg pugs are fine, i hate people who join pugs expecting to 1shot everything in 30minnutes
[3:54:32] smergol_: hi ziqo last epoch or last epoch
[3:54:32] timeoutandy: yeah if there ever was a reason to check logs after watching this stream its def a logs angle LUL
[3:54:44] Korvynah: that YT video you made on the Gnomer rejects did pretty well huh
[3:54:49] smergol_: i mean d4 or last epoch
[3:54:51] weyachi: what weapons are you using ziqo?
[3:55:01] JUMJUMnoMi: @sdotpuff that boomy clearly never did any healing or pvp before to not have it
[3:55:16] sacalac104: I only check logs to show that they have cleared 6/6 not that they have a good parse
[3:55:27] sdotpuff: @jumjumnomi yeah makes sense. I guess you could get by with Sunfire for pve
[3:55:27] Drivebypwned: i mean you ahve some people in there with decent gear doing sheet dam
[3:55:42] corrupbrothas: beansGhost so bright
[3:55:43] axetionhank: light mode on all your apps is crazy to me hah
[3:55:45] DaaamnTV: 100% pure original US raid
[3:55:48] rainmannxz: light mode OMEGALUL
[3:55:51] missonyxtv: checking the facts ofc ziqoS
[3:56:08] JUMJUMnoMi: @sdotpuff I dont get it, but some players truly tunnel vision and dont ''Waste'' time on anything until it wastes 9 other people time because they cant play their class lol
[3:56:15] body_type_two: my eyes
[3:56:24] FIREMAGZZ: he LEFT ON STREAM
[3:56:28] body_type_two: Saved
[3:56:30] zoombaaaa: first 4 bosses are a joke
[3:56:32] FIREMAGZZ: thats how BAD its gotten
[3:56:36] jhk97: if you expect a pug to clear in an hour, dont pug :)
[3:56:37] shuyinko123: @Ziqoftw chaaad
[3:56:38] Marcus2234: ngl, this is sod, you should clear it in 1-1.5h imo
[3:56:38] timeoutandy: 135 hps priest Kappa
[3:56:40] FIREMAGZZ: its a COMMUNITY ISSUE
[3:56:40] My_keI: He left cuz of wipes?
[3:56:41] shuyinko123: guess how back
[3:56:59] shuyinko123: @Ziqoftw Chaad whathappend tanks problems?
[3:57:07] jhk97: @shuyinko123 healer left
[3:57:11] Rammers: its a pug you should at least have 1.5 hours free. as a guild yea it is much faster
[3:57:15] jhk97: @jhk97 and now tank dipped too
[3:57:16] sdotpuff: @jumjumnomi getting runes was just something to do at some point. That's when I got my off spec runes. But yeah some could care less LUL
[3:57:17] COMMEdesRATS: anybody who leaves within 1 hour is a bozo
[3:57:24] JUMJUMnoMi: you were way within expectation, thats a healer god complex right there
[3:57:28] mistahfrank: if you cant handle 1-2 wipes then gtfo
[3:57:30] Drhaxx12: People with better logs less chance to be dumb
[3:57:33] Marcus2234: ye
[3:57:35] ryu_mmo: true
[3:57:39] Av3nturA: world first speed is 18 min..and u want to clear in 1:30 min and .. you wanna parse?
[3:57:39] Marcus2234: 1.5h is max, after is discussionable
[3:57:42] bassiemon123: Just a toxic kid born 2k+ prob wasnt in time for his daily dora the explorer
[3:57:44] timeoutandy: @Drhaxx12 exactly
[3:57:53] ryu_mmo: i understand emergencies though
[3:57:56] Qrucials: Do you have to be 40 to get in?
[3:58:01] Marcus2234: happy im always solo healing these runs so no need on new heal :D
[3:58:15] jhk97: @Drhaxx12 its just hilarious how many people post LFM with "log checks" while having greylogs themselves xd
[3:58:18] mistahfrank: way too many "emergencies" with gamer dads tbh
[3:58:33] Speyto: ^
[3:58:41] My_keI: but did he have to go cuz he saw the wipes and knew it would take much longer
[3:58:43] siggysudzz: pretty sure normal gnomer takes like an hour
[3:58:45] muhfin: no
[3:58:46] kusoneko: this is you check parses LUL
[3:58:47] Speyto: always wife aggro
[3:58:48] timeoutandy: 40 years old yes :)
[3:58:50] 775anthonymike: even with my guild run i had to re elixir for the last boss and we didnt wipe
[3:59:02] muhfin: i did it with a 39 hunter 1st lockout
[3:59:03] mealtiime: @kusoneko because healer parses makes sense KEKZ
[3:59:03] Ronafca: i pugged entire p1, now i found a nice guild during a pug in p2 and its so nice and smooth
[3:59:08] JUMJUMnoMi: @jhk97 tbh its better than seeing this bozo 4/6
[3:59:09] Falscherfux93: @jhk97 yea i realised that too. i always ask them if they checked themselfs on wcl
[3:59:32] big_dave_raves: dang another failed run I see why people check logs now
[3:59:44] Carcer69: @JUMJUMnoMi @Drhaxx12 You literally get punished for doing mechanics right
[3:59:51] Speyto: he said he could OT
[3:59:52] Verolf: @mealtiime you can solo heal all of gnomer and its pretty easy to look at the healer log and see what they cast even if the percentile looks bad
[3:59:53] My_keI: we play this game for fun, Fun is efficiently clearing raid and having good parses to show for it for a large portion of the player base
[4:00:15] jhk97: thats your fun
[4:00:17] mistahfrank: if thats what you think fun is then holy f
[4:00:18] TCGgWI: i learned this phase that there are actually people who only hit a button every 3-10 GCDs. people raiding with white damage. thats fun to some people... kms.
[4:00:24] Marcus2234: fun is rp in goldshire Kappa
[4:00:27] mealtiime: @Verolf healer logs are the most useless thing as they have no real analytical value for regular pugs
[4:00:30] Disord3r: I couldnt care less about peoples parses
[4:00:37] pweepysonkun: what boss r they on?
[4:00:39] camwowgg: fuck your parses im there to meet people and just chat shit while gaming
[4:00:43] axetionhank: wow players are BiS gatekeepers, always have been
[4:00:51] jhk97: @mealtiime there are people cheesing healer logs by dropping entire raids health to 20% before boss pulls XD
[4:00:52] rainmannxz: ^
[4:00:57] My_keI: is it fun for anyone, to wipe and take a ton of time doin the same thing cuz 1 or 2 ppl cant figure it out?
[4:01:01] mealtiime: @jhk97 exactly
[4:01:01] FIREMAGZZ: 100 percent ture ziqo
[4:01:03] muhfin: healing parses are irrelevant i thought this was known
[4:01:13] JUMJUMnoMi: @Carcer69 yeah not my point, but also right. I was talking about just someone with 6/6 show they learned and have some resilience especially if they grey that's a +1 in my book unless they have under 150dps...
[4:01:18] BsG_Bigbudz: Ziqo is a chad with excellent music taste, that's objective.
[4:01:20] StickEmWithThePointyEnd: StickEmWithThePointyEnd subscribed at Tier 2. They've subscribed for 17 months, currently on a 17 month streak! 
[4:01:21] Verolf: @jhk97 ok but nobody is looking for a healer with all 100s -_-
[4:01:21] JohnSpecter: LUL
[4:01:23] mistahfrank: I updated tinder profile: fun is clearing raids efficiently. im getting bi**es left and right
[4:01:25] OyyBruv: im feeling moist rn
[4:01:26] Speyto: They need to have the same ambitions
[4:01:26] scheumell: Hey @Ziqoftw would you mind to switch details on Dmg please? <3
[4:01:31] jhk97: @muhfin i think most active players know that healer parses dont mean shit, some still havent gotten the message tho
[4:01:36] Mayxlol: Its very easy to see in 9/10 recruitment messages in trade or lfg if the group is a sweaty group or not. Most sweat groups specify "parse run". Its very simple
[4:01:42] missonyxtv: @mistahfrank pog brother
[4:01:51] mistahfrank: <3
[4:01:53] Heroic_Skelesaurus: this is why i never trust warrior flex tanks
[4:01:56] howie_dewit: Dont play a team game, if you cant handle when a team is learning.
[4:01:56] patrikpetrak2: it is toxic to join sweaty group to carry them but it is also super toxic to join cassual group and sweat there
[4:02:06] tylersquareee: the raid is still super new its wild to expect everyone to have it down perfectly already
[4:02:07] My_keI: fun is subjective sure but unfun is pretty universal imo but he im just a moron twitch chatter
[4:02:08] siggysudzz: they wanna speedrun it so they can go back to sitting in a main city sadge
[4:02:13] mumfiezz: i play pug roulette, first one whispering gets invited
[4:02:17] FIREMAGZZ: OVERCOMING CHALLENGES MAKES YOU A MAN
[4:02:18] JUMJUMnoMi: and thats not 2-3 people, everyone had to coordinate more on the menagerie. it's a voicechat check boss lol
[4:02:19] Carcer69: @My_keI true you are
[4:02:19] axetionhank: just always be good and never struggle ok
[4:02:24] FIREMAGZZ: sorry my caps lock broke
[4:02:25] nickydangles: agreed look at elden ring its allabout wiping until accomplishment
[4:02:26] icadillchips: I really dont understand the issue. Let people play casually and wipe sometimes if they want. Dont have to oneshot everything everytime
[4:02:32] coffeeJosh: feed pet
[4:02:37] jhk97: @tylersquareee especially considering that ziqo intentionally takes the rejects, the people who havent gotten much practice
[4:02:38] Drhaxx12: Progressing with a guild is fun but not randons being dumb
[4:02:44] purplewingedboa: I wish I could join gnomers while locked out and just not able able to roll on loot.
[4:02:45] Synthez542: @shuyinko123 DonkWave
[4:02:52] nickydangles: Mage tower in Legion was GAS
[4:02:56] Vir0n: or pens
[4:02:59] Carcer69: Mage tower was so fun
[4:03:02] sabotoer420: i miss legion
[4:03:04] My_keI: @Carcer69 and the fact you repeat my statement shows you're even more of a moron than me KEKW nice outting yourself
[4:03:09] Anikoner: darksoul in wow
[4:03:11] Jahhe: Brawler's Guild was fun aswell
[4:03:15] QwQGolden: feeling of overcoming obstacles  > instant steam roll instant gratification angle
[4:03:18] jhk97: @purplewingedboa ye they should just do Loot lock instead of not being able to join at all, would be so much better
[4:03:44] Vir0n: I miss Torghast Kapp
[4:03:46] jhk97: ziqo doing gods work
[4:03:47] rainmannxz: ego gatekeepers no likey Madge
[4:04:03] goonlips: @jhk97 then trade chats going to be people selling gnomer runs for buyers
[4:04:12] body_type_two: Blocking ads... EZ
[4:04:13] djdogwater: ziqo pls mute yourself for a sec so i can shazam this sony ty in advance
[4:04:15] jhk97: @goonlips thats already happening tho
[4:04:17] djdogwater: song
[4:04:17] mealtiime: Torgast was fun for the first hour or so
[4:04:18] Glaedz: Torghast was shittaah, part of the reason why i quit
[4:04:19] aysalamki: Hello
[4:04:23] goonlips: @jhk97 no it isnt
[4:04:23] Nightbot: Bring balance to your setup - get the Harmony PC today! https://starforgepc.com/Ziqo
[4:04:30] liljizza: they hyped up torghast so much pre release Sadge
[4:04:36] QwQGolden: the maw could of been amazing wpvp but they fuckin pve cucked it. Imagine blood moon type apporach in the maw
[4:04:42] rainmannxz: Yep
[4:04:44] BoyEnzy: i think you could have
[4:04:48] sabotoer420: one more try with the druid and it was kill for sure
[4:04:56] rainmannxz: It was a good group, failing is not THE END OMEGALUL
[4:04:57] jhk97: @goonlips maybe you havent seen it yet, people are selling Gnomer runs with different prio for different prices, aka full price u get full loot prio. its shit but its real
[4:05:01] mesamees: think people compare gnomer to bfd. bfd so much easier compared to this. both are easy but not for classic players

[4:05:04] cr4nkc0r3: @My_keI its frustrating tbh if 1-2 ppl just bring down all the others. I dont mind wiping and learning and then correcting fails, thats fun, but some ppl seem to have iq of bread and then it can get frustrating
[4:05:17] goonlips: @jhk97 no it isnt stop making bs up
[4:05:20] Vir0n: Can't wait to build my outpost again in wod classic Kapp
[4:05:39] Carcer69: no
[4:05:39] Korvynah: Nax
[4:05:42] cookie_jayy: no
[4:05:45] Falscherfux93: no
[4:05:48] My_keI: @cr4nkc0r3 exactly my point, so either ween them out by kicking them early when you notice or there has to be a pre check to avoid these undesirables
[4:05:48] danparsonss: nax when it was first released had some mechanics
[4:05:50] Drezzi_: maybe long and annoying but not hard
[4:05:50] GahvMan: hard is subjective tho
[4:05:51] QwQGolden: Nope, but dont let the sweats find out lmao
[4:05:51] missonyxtv: by today's standards? no.
[4:05:52] body_type_two: @Vir0n KEKL
[4:05:53] danparsonss: not all bosses
[4:05:56] danparsonss: 4 horseman
[4:06:00] mtndewslurpee: aq 40 was meh

[4:06:27] Ronafca: sapphiron was a dps check i guess
[4:06:30] danparsonss: you speak like its so easy, but do these raids with 39 other people

[4:07:10] cookie_jayy: 1 mechanic boss andys LULW
[4:07:12] missonyxtv: I think asmon said it best, that nothing in classic was actually hard. it was lack of player knowledge, Whittier computers and internet, etc. certain other aspects made it SEEM hard, but it never really was.
[4:07:12] mealtiime: the real mechanic of Classic raids is organizing 40 people
[4:07:13] danparsonss: and i did say in original release
[4:07:14] siggysudzz: ever try getting 25 idiots to click on magtherodon. KEKW

[4:08:15] QwQGolden: Even the least sweaty parse meta goblin of the present day would outperform some of the most committed raiders of 20 yrs ago
[4:08:33] Vir0n: good raid lead, 1 good tank and 1 tiny violin
[4:08:46] missonyxtv: mmmmm ..... chicken
[4:08:53] mealtiime: and also you need the Ventrilo DJ to boost the morale
[4:09:06] danparsonss: @AzoreanLegend i agree, getting 40 competent people is not ez
[4:09:14] jhk97: @goonlips google wow SoD loot boost :)

[4:37:54] Drhaxx12: 5/6 why do people check logs Kappa
[4:38:13] itsBdaws: @drhaxx12 shut up nerd
[4:38:15] Soul_Linked: LULW
[4:38:16] rothwall1: !server
[4:38:16] Nightbot: Crusader strike NA
[4:38:31] pweepysonkun: put your feral on bombs with sunfire, and 1 person clicks every other, its a good strat
[4:39:04] JUMJUMnoMi: @dbvaluation he's so strong willed and still uplifting vibe he's fixing one thing after the other like a real RL
[4:39:28] deadly22: I feel liek im a aprt of this raid and want it to succeed lol
[4:39:31] deadly22: im in vested
[4:39:33] Verolf: go take the druid and get WG then come back with boon :)
[4:39:55] Verolf: 2 hrs later you will get this dub KappaCool
[4:40:04] lnaishingi: lost dispels kinda rough
[4:40:12] JUMJUMnoMi: wild growth will take time .... its a few steps tho
[4:40:12] happyheals: can you look at healing for last attempt?
[4:40:28] Synthez542: Not alot
[4:40:28] Verolf: no
[4:40:32] Verolf: it's nothing
[4:40:32] BoyEnzy: no thats doodoo
[4:40:37] JUMJUMnoMi: he gotta run in Ashenvale for the first 2 step then last step in Southshore....
[4:40:38] gia__: takes like an hour to get wg, pretty long
[4:40:39] Synthez542: I did 200+ this morning on my priest
[4:40:53] Duleriumm: still no dspell my man
[4:40:57] happyheals: a shadow priest can heal that much
[4:41:05] FIREMAGZZ: Despite adding ANOTHER healing class to the game, there are less healers than ever lol
[4:41:11] Grindecologist: have the lock consume magic with their dog
[4:41:23] JUMJUMnoMi: the pet taunt is the strat to remove dispell in this group tho
[4:41:38] Verolf: @FIREMAGZZ because healing is def the most boring role
[4:41:45] deadly22: they should just make spriests be able to heal well too
[4:41:50] happyheals: I'm level 30 spriest leveling atm. Def getting the increased healing talent
[4:41:52] deadly22: maker them the god class might as well
[4:42:00] Verolf: it is fighting to not fall asleep for the entire dungeon/raid
[4:42:27] JUMJUMnoMi: Pet taunt will help the tank/heals, maybe even Mend Pet and loose some dps to keep tank alive, the tank should wait a while before taunting back so the stacks wears off
[4:42:48] Jepper: @deadly22 spriest can easily do 150-200 hps while just dpsing
[4:42:48] lbadwithnames: Shruge
[4:43:05] timeoutandy: they should make an addon like raider.io so u can check logs on tooltip Kappa
[4:43:06] munkeminister: pulling without priest is gg
[4:43:08] Verolf: you could prob recruit a new healer if you guaranteed them an item, easy bait
[4:43:09] JUMJUMnoMi: @Jepper yeah not every spriest focus on healing, he should be reminded maybe
[4:43:18] FIREMAGZZ: they need to rethink healing in future MMOs is just not fund and people dont wanna play them anymore
[4:43:19] milkytaco: We have been running dbl spriest and have a resto sham solo heal
[4:43:23] skamahz: you need priest dispel for this fight
[4:43:24] Jepper: @JUMJUMnoMi its just vampiric embrace, nothing else
[4:43:29] Lizardmale: I can come heal for 20g LUL
[4:43:31] TopRinser: elclappo'd
[4:43:36] Ronafca: this fight is all about doing the mechanics, not a dps race at all
[4:43:47] Soul_Linked: KEKW
[4:43:53] salken: priest is 100% not needed
[4:44:07] siggysudzz: give him a binky while hes at it
[4:44:16] DJC_: time to invite the almighty brick
[4:44:23] Ronafca: isnt the healing the problem because the bombs?
[4:44:35] skamahz: but you need to cleanse the disease in p3
[4:44:36] Soul_Linked: just fap ?
[4:44:45] skamahz: oh shaman nvm
[4:44:46] SamuraiWillZ916: mass dsipell clears all the frost stacks i think
[4:44:47] JUMJUMnoMi: @Jepper yeah then he doesnt dps enough XD but maybe he forgets to reapply it idk, its like Faerie Fire or any debuffs on Boss it should alway be on the boss and somehow it isnt
[4:45:05] timeoutandy: mass dispell LUL
[4:45:18] JUMJUMnoMi: @timeoutandy on the ads ???! Kappa
[4:45:19] shaman4ever: Big Z are you going to play Cata?
[4:45:25] Duleriumm: fab dosent remove stacks tho
[4:45:32] itsBdaws: overthinking it feels like they would rather not even try than try n fail?
[4:45:35] ryu_mmo: holy :(
[4:45:47] lil__dolo: waituhhh
[4:45:54] assrug: bro i'm so glad echo won the tourny it would have been so tragic if the would have lost ( arguably would have lost to ping after trill lived on 0%)
[4:45:56] rainmannxz: LET ME TELL U SOMETHING
[4:46:05] Ronafca: BOGGED agent reporting in
[4:46:06] wowalbi: Agent 9 EZ
[4:46:07] Soul_Linked: PauseBusiness
[4:46:08] JUMJUMnoMi: @Duleriumm yeah ofc its when you get the 1st stack from cooling discharge, at least it allows 30sec to wears off if some people didnt click fast enough
[4:46:16] rainmannxz: EZ he's in
[4:46:23] itsBdaws: WOOOOOOOOOOOO
[4:46:24] notoriousz: I think this is why people are so anal about logs and parses, because people cba doing this every 3 days
[4:46:28] Soul_Linked: KEKW
[4:46:29] sabotoer420: KEKZ
[4:46:32] Soul_Linked: thats not hard
[4:46:35] Soul_Linked: ay
[4:46:38] QwQGolden: @Ziqoftw Im the agent you animal i need to respec heals
[4:46:39] happyheals: 2 bandages and a healing pot
[4:46:39] shaman4ever: @Ziqoftw Big Z are you going to play Cata?
[4:46:40] itsBdaws: WERE SO BACK BOYS
[4:46:47] assrug: Soul_Linked thats the joke
[4:46:47] timeoutandy: Do whatever u want LUL how to indirect calling him useless LUL
[4:47:01] JUMJUMnoMi: Ziqo grind is real
[4:47:03] Soul_Linked: KEKVibe
[4:47:04] itsBdaws: inspirational @ziqoftw
[4:47:09] Ronafca: not that i disagree with u, but this is why ppl ask for clear xp, parses etc
[4:47:20] sabotoer420: this is great
[4:47:29] JUMJUMnoMi: it was inflicted upon you guys  you guys are good
[4:47:34] itsBdaws: people would rather just not even try than try and fail
[4:47:42] JUMJUMnoMi: fr you were clearing EZ Clap
[4:47:46] spacetravelergaming: when did the mentality of gaming change?
[4:48:05] assrug: but wiping to bosses hurts my fragile ego, (i rely heavily on video games for my ego)
[4:48:09] happyheals: you are trying to do a good thing. There will be a few meh moments
[4:48:18] FIREMAGZZ: WE NEED TO FIND A WAY HOW TO DE-WEINER this community ziqo
[4:48:31] JUMJUMnoMi: this Lock need a Dance lap after getting this many closet out
[4:48:32] abiduel: gnomer takes forever thats why
[4:48:41] tylersquareee: i dont get why people join raids when they have a time frame to get it done in?
[4:48:55] happyheals: the time frame thing is always an excuse
[4:48:56] tylersquareee: dont join if you only have a little bit of time youre fuycking other people
[4:49:08] assrug: but wiping to bosses hurts my fragile ego, (i rely heavily on video games for my ego) 󠀀
[4:49:09] abiduel: he gives up bc its a waste of his time
[4:49:12] tonkzilla: people who give up are cowards
[4:49:15] JUMJUMnoMi: FR Shuy also got better right even tho Lifeless Lock is the gigachad
[4:49:25] timeoutandy: Gamer dads want it all Kappa Spend minimum time in raids, bad parses, complains they cant get invite, when they get invite they leave. Perfect gamer dads Kappa
[4:49:42] JUMJUMnoMi: @timeoutandy right Kappa
[4:49:43] big_dave_raves: gamer dad's enjoying 2 hour wipe fest
[4:49:48] Speyto: 100%
[4:49:59] happyheals: does pally have freedom yet?
[4:50:00] TCGgWI: dont hate on gamer dads. some of us are out here winning
[4:50:06] Speyto: If u join a raid then u gotta lock in for 1-2h
[4:50:31] wowalbi: like 40-50min yea
[4:50:33] cmf_westers: 45 mintues ish
[4:50:36] Marcus2234: wait u arent done yet?
[4:50:39] TCGgWI: PoS
[4:50:40] TCGgWI: ya
[4:50:42] toxicvolvo: 30 mins i'd say KEKW
[4:50:49] r3muz: o7
[4:50:49] lnaishingi: keep all the loot till the end so the leavers get nothing
[4:51:03] abiduel: but tanks and heals can do that
[4:51:21] Ronafca: makes u wonder how this is gonna go with 20man raids next phases
[4:51:35] lindersen1: thats smart
[4:51:35] wowalbi: you can ninjaloot easier as well this way Kappa
[4:51:35] coolio_beanio: i do that every pug
[4:51:39] happyheals: yeah in bfd it was awesome. Always had like 35-40 min runs
[4:51:40] FIREMAGZZ: LEMME TELL YOU GUYS ABOUT A RAID SYSTEM WHERE NOBODY LEAVES. ITS CALLED GDKP
[4:51:46] aaaSPACEMAN: @Ronafca will be hell to pug
[4:51:59] itsBdaws: bfd is sick exactly for that reason @happyheals
[4:52:00] Stars69: my only pug 5/6 was a healer 2x sr tier chest, won it then left on last boss kek
[4:52:01] big_dave_raves: Gdkp the good old days
[4:52:11] tonkzilla: that's why pugs suck.. no loyalty to the group
[4:52:16] JUMJUMnoMi: well I understand hahah like hold the loot so the pug don't leave
[4:52:19] assrug: thats how it goes on retail a bunch of people join and leave after each boss because they only join for the boss they need loot from
[4:52:43] Ronafca: but retail doesnt have raid ID's in the same way
[4:52:46] happyheals: adopt the boss lockout system maybe
[4:52:51] cmf_westers: only reasons you would hold loot is speed run or if you do a +1 system but you wanna make sure people know what dropped before they get +1 on something small
[4:52:51] Nethylol: no
[4:52:53] Fuwahta: Wasted of lockout because RL wanted to keep loot until after 5th boss but only told us after we killed 1st boss. Half of the raid left
[4:52:53] Verolf: no
[4:52:55] coolio_beanio: no lol
[4:52:55] zoombaaaa: yes
[4:52:56] wreckstormx: nope
[4:52:57] Tal_NeonFlame: No I think GDKP is bad news.
[4:53:01] zoombaaaa: blizzard is stupid for banning GDKP
[4:53:02] itsBdaws: boss lockout system seems like the smartest solution
[4:53:07] My_keI: they are 100% smoother raids 99% of the time
[4:53:14] Stars69: gdkp being bad is only a symptom of a larger issue anyway
[4:53:17] Speyto: U could distribute loot at the end of the raid too so ppl gotta stay
[4:53:18] Ronafca: GDKP is just a front for gold laundering
[4:53:32] happyheals: gdkp kept classic raiding alive when everyone left
[4:53:35] FIREMAGZZ: very very very few leave cause they want the gold at the end
[4:53:38] derNoaa: im glad gdkps are gone, you can actually find regular pugs
[4:53:40] siggysudzz: careful agent 9 works for pshero
[4:53:44] FIREMAGZZ: THANK YOU HAPPYHEALS
[4:53:44] Tal_NeonFlame: Blizz needs to put in Loot lockouts for a start instead of ids
[4:53:45] big_dave_raves: ciciban raids were bis
[4:53:46] Qrucials: Lockout system would fix so many issues, but it won't happen in classic, too many changes
[4:53:58] assrug: gdkp is the best for everyone but gamer dads
[4:54:04] timeoutandy: Yeah ban GDKP boosters, they have ties to the italian mob and do human trafficking on the side
[4:54:11] happyheals: :)
[4:54:12] FIREMAGZZ: Gamer dads know how to CRY
[4:54:22] pweepysonkun: ppl flamed bfd for being too easy, so funny they made gnomer much harder
[4:54:38] j03seph: I feel like it only favors gamer dads with money and no time
[4:54:50] timeoutandy: min bid 50g per item :)
[4:55:04] HateRage_: mhmm
[4:55:12] lil__dolo: ziqoT mmhmm
[4:55:13] Fuwahta: Checking logs LUL
[4:55:15] rainmannxz: mmmmmmhm.
[4:55:16] matibragadini: drivers license?
[4:55:19] wreckstormx: naked gachiGASM
[4:55:20] padierman: 3 months of bank statements?
[4:55:21] itsBdaws: LOOL
[4:55:23] Tal_NeonFlame: DankNoted mmhmm
[4:55:24] Verolf: do u need to know the strats or logs while naked and buying 👀
[4:55:39] rainmannxz: budget? NOTED
[4:55:41] Falscherfux93: but gdkps leaders dont check loggs when they wanna get full buyers. they have carrys who carry those buyers
[4:55:41] big_dave_raves: you don't need good logs as big buyer
[4:55:42] timeoutandy: come trade to confirm budget :)
[4:55:44] ooTHExTUBEoo: these raid leaders spend 4 hours prepping for a 30 minute raid
[4:55:56] happyheals: it kept geared players running the content instead of being non existent in the game though too
[4:55:59] lil__dolo: what type of jacket do you want
[4:56:03] Stars69: this loot is market price. what's the market price? budget??
[4:56:07] assrug: yeah but when you slaugher a pig you weigh it before
[4:56:15] lil__dolo: and how much will you pay
[4:56:25] FIREMAGZZ: they ask me that in the states when you to the store and are trying to buy something like over 1000 purchase
[4:56:27] snekkn1: poor people problems :/
[4:56:37] aysalamki: but all gdkp leaders in sod ask ur budget
[4:57:01] happyheals: I haven't done a gdkp since 2010 or so, but I think in theory it has a place
[4:57:07] Sosatko: Idk ppl should be able to choose how they wanna play
[4:57:11] Verolf: then you scalp the raid by stealing the pot because you organized on a level 1
[4:57:15] xaaaaa: true gdkps used to ask for gold
[4:57:16] snekkn1: i prefer soft res tbh
[4:57:18] Sosatko: the reality is blizz banned them b/c they invest 0 into their own TOS
[4:57:20] FIREMAGZZ: Positive discipline in raid Negative: often Hella corrupt
[4:57:29] assrug: just don't be a new player
[4:57:31] assrug: Kappa
[4:57:48] Ronafca: thats cause they only take swipers
[4:57:49] Jumpka: just swipe Kappa
[4:57:50] assrug: just be a gigchad bis parser who has all the loot anyway
[4:57:52] SamuraiWillZ916: but i do have a credit card lol
[4:57:56] timeoutandy: better start farming mobs for gold then or become a daddy gamer and swipe
[4:58:00] COMMEdesRATS: solution: peacebloom dkp KEKW
[4:58:02] aaaSPACEMAN: if you lie they get mad if you don't bid on stuff though
[4:58:03] Tal_NeonFlame: How surprising. Its almost as if GDKP is built on getting Gold.. somewhere else.
[4:58:04] rainmannxz: corrupt rats can't do their corrupt gdkps oh nyooo
[4:58:07] hooqs: yep need a friend who leads who can let you leech
[4:58:11] Sosatko: If blizz wasnt bad and actually invested into enforcing their own TOS gdkp would be fine
[4:58:12] calvescere: I bought gold and got banned xD
[4:58:13] FIREMAGZZ: guilds are BEGGING people to join them
[4:58:16] darkthreats123: g2g
[4:58:21] jnuts10: But do you think a regular raid would invite a fresh 80?
[4:58:25] xaaaaa: but they ask you to show them in trade screen KEKW
[4:58:29] de_dude: if you dont buy gold you dont stand a chance
[4:58:40] gia__: it's a pretty toxic environment overall, full of people that even in a normal group would roll on your items and then whisper offering to sell
[4:58:42] Stars69: LA MAK VISAA
[4:58:51] timeoutandy: g2g my god, my ai, my religion :)
[4:58:54] Aktz_: You missed the best part: The Leaders of said grps are the ones selling the gold
[4:58:55] Ronafca: lost ark has partially build in gdkp, works well
[4:58:55] waskaie: amex
[4:59:03] assrug: no you make money from gdkps on your main and then you use this gold for alts
[4:59:04] calvescere: gdkp shouldnt be a thing tbh
[4:59:13] happyheals: classic wow just needs some kind of system where you can q    into a lfg system or something
[4:59:14] kreeezy: It's a wrong incentive
[4:59:15] de_dude: thats why i quick wrath actually
[4:59:21] mordmannjr: but they are not forced to do gdkp
[4:59:22] de_dude: quit
[4:59:30] rainmannxz: the only people who are left playing WOTLK are them OMEGALUL
[4:59:36] calvescere: @mordmannjr everyone does
[4:59:38] coolio_beanio: gdkp is why my wife left me
[4:59:45] graceybfrg: lol u still in here? xD
[4:59:47] VIRUSplw: sr is definitly the best for pugs
[4:59:49] xaaaaa: sr is the safest
[4:59:50] aysalamki: hidden sr its best system
[4:59:53] assrug: he is melee hunter?
[4:59:55] Safty: yeah i think sr is the best
[4:59:59] Safty: but for casual
[4:59:59] Jumpka: sr feels really nice ye
[4:59:59] Verolf: boomie is pumping 👀
[5:00:01] sqwertboi: Im missing your weapon printning tbc gold farm
[5:00:09] Ronafca: this is the pull
[5:00:13] Safty: Master loot is the best for prog
[5:00:19] darkthreats123: SR is really convenient
[5:00:28] FIREMAGZZ: i miss the pre mega server TRADE CHAT OUTCASTING people. if someone left they were slandered in trade chat for hours and noone would invite them in groups anymore
[5:00:29] rainmannxz: LUL
[5:00:36] zak618: how easy it is if you have a priest healer who clicks buttons
[5:00:41] Sosatko: Why stay if no gold at the end xd
[5:00:42] zak618: and does more than 80hps
[5:00:53] Synthez542: They would've stayed if pshero was in there Sadge
[5:00:53] Vetto_7: Wankge ok
[5:01:10] ghemba1355: You should be fapping during the cast so it protects agasints 2 casts
[5:01:17] wreckstormx: i think i like ms>os the best when no one ninjas
[5:01:24] assrug: FIREMAGZZ nah thats truee i had shitty internet and very strict pc times on vanilla i basically left every dungeon and raid i ever joind and i never had problems getting invited ( was a little kid so give me a break)
[5:01:27] happyheals: they need diff servers for wow where people who are chill and play the game have servers, and people who have issues with everything have their own servers
[5:01:53] Verolf: @happyheals lol
[5:01:58] happyheals: lol

[5:30:40] Grumlud: i remember once in other version of wow, there was a warrior with blizzard boosted gear everyone was saying don't invite this guy he is boosted, and he was best tank i ever had in my leveling. since classic came out all these youtube min/max andys...
[5:30:45] Difcar: The issue is that you get dozens and dozens dps asking to join your group, why would you take the hunter with a bad specc. When I create a raid and specifically ask for a healer I still get a ton of dps asking
[5:31:05] Kira_Corpse: truee
[5:31:06] timeoutandy: so just check logs LUL
[5:31:10] happyheals: they need a filter that marks people who complain in chat channels and 3 strikes it removes them from your feed
[5:31:18] svakkaN: whats even more funny is that SoD is short for Season of Dadgamers. Yet its more sweaty than retail somehow LUL

[5:33:54] Korvynah: asmon really resonated with the emerging from sewers part
[5:33:55] Difcar: @pandacsoki_boborjan It's not gatekeeping, you invite people that make your run smooth, it will always happen everywhere. If you don't like the groups make your own group
[5:34:07] timeoutandy: "let me just put my dps spells on my bars and im ready :) "

[5:35:05] Difcar: @maddhatterr When you make a raid there are only 10 spots, you can't invite everyone...

[5:36:23] zak618: is this react-ception?
[5:36:29] nWirb: Didn't even check the ancestry review of the raiders you invited smh
[5:36:36] zak618: you reacting to asmon reacting to you lol
[5:36:36] happyheals: you gotta be really fucking high to get hit by the 1 mile  an hour cog wheel
[5:36:37] body_type_two: the react god Pog

[5:38:00] happyheals: I just love playing the game, struggle or not. I love to troll complaining and eat popcorn
[5:38:04] pandacsoki_boborjan: @Difcar on 20 keys it's very different tho, when we run someone's 10 key i invite the first decent player and there's 0 problems
[5:38:13] JUMJUMnoMi: you were his 1st Ziqo
[5:38:21] Difcar: Asmon is wrong because the bottleneck is healers, dps fills up insta and you can be super picky. You have to wait for the healers anyway.
[5:38:33] nWirb: Imagine not even asking for a full DNA sequencing, drug test and stool samples for your raiders before you invite them
[5:38:37] body_type_two: frist  what
[5:38:38] body_type_two: first
[5:38:45] Carcer69: he was on crusader strike
[5:38:47] happyheals: M+20 keys are like 2-3 chest with random pugs if you do the proper gatekeeping
[5:38:52] Kira_Corpse: D:
[5:38:53] zak618: he started crusader strike US
[5:38:55] Vir0n: he's going to EU

[5:39:11] ayyyyopierre: lol

[5:39:16] itsjake92: disable addons is what he said
[5:39:18] r3muz: i agree
[5:39:20] hotmanpop: all the addons
[5:39:22] QwQGolden: No add ons no API
[5:39:28] JamesIRL: i like logs. gives me something to work towards
[5:39:29] hotmanpop: YEP
[5:39:32] Donzle: people would somehow find a way to gate content anyway
[5:39:32] QwQGolden: 10000% it would be better
[5:39:34] body_type_two: not all
[5:39:35] Carcer69: no addons except quality of life
[5:39:37] body_type_two: yes
[5:39:39] pandacsoki_boborjan: @happyheals yeah, i'm not running with pugs, just with guildies
[5:39:40] kusoneko: need gladius AT LEAST
[5:39:40] letsgetgoingyo: No lol, unplayable without addons
[5:39:40] hotmanpop: for sure
[5:39:41] Carcer69: or add it to base ui

[5:39:42] wreckstormx: yep
[5:39:42] mealtiime: i want to keep my VuhDo addon Sadge
[5:39:42] body_type_two: true
[5:39:43] ayyyyopierre: i wont play if theres no dps meter
[5:39:44] rainmannxz: yep, these addons exist for a reason
[5:39:44] kreeezy: Questie
[5:39:44] ForellenlorDD: dmg meter
[5:39:46] stillfly: if they disable addons they need to make raids easier too
[5:39:47] magnus03001: dear god not more iNvItE tO aSmOn lAyEr KEKL
[5:39:48] happyheals: they need a new new classic mode that blocks add ons
[5:39:49] Vir0n: on retail you almost don't need addons
[5:39:50] hotmanpop: questie and all this good shit
[5:39:50] muhfin: ya like all the weakauras everyone uses
[5:39:50] docxxd: min max andys

[5:40:01] hotmanpop: @muhfin OMEGALUL
[5:40:02] muhfin: most should just be built in to the boss fight, timers and such
[5:40:02] happyheals: disastery
[5:40:07] jokaa199: dbm boss mechaniks?
[5:40:07] docxxd: would lost their shit if they took away addons
[5:40:10] hivemindqt: season of tryhards
[5:40:15] letsgetgoingyo: just have addons, addons are sick
[5:40:15] RushoGG: Final Fantasy 14 Does it, they banned all kind of "Addons" nobody is allowed to use it BUT this is the twist, people still used it Illegaly
[5:40:18] yatazuchimar: well i only started using dr tracker in classic, before ive never used any and its fine
[5:40:18] Carcer69: Wa is the worst addon ever created
[5:40:23] docxxd: min max andys
[5:40:27] hivemindqt: season of quitters

[5:40:33] docxxd: aids
[5:40:34] Rakgthora: Chan is foaming at the mouth hearing your take on WA's
[5:40:35] PutridFart: thats monka tos!
[5:40:39] RushoGG: They use it against the ToS
[5:40:40] kusoneko: cheaters always find a way
[5:40:42] Swayvuh: warcraft logs is the real issue
[5:40:46] RushoGG: it's not allowed in the ToS
[5:40:47] QwQGolden: Mes WA pack lmao
[5:40:50] Curtsy: Lots of external addons
[5:40:51] happyheals: if you take the time to learn how to edit weak auras, you can make them very minimal
[5:40:51] JUMJUMnoMi: treath classic and dps meter are legit tho I just use it to follow the flow of the fight not even that much for parsing, at least improve and be mindful for the tank aggro
[5:40:52] 1Tavino: they use the old tech
[5:40:52] RedTheEpic: Why though? Keep the DPS charts. People who don't want DPS meters are the same shitters that make it 10x harder to complete content. You want content that you can complete? Don't go into HARD content and bring everyone down if you suck or are one of these people.
[5:40:54] orange_bean: its not possiible unless they take away clinets side info
[5:40:58] Vir0n: they absolutely can disable it
[5:41:00] PutridFart: mes pack Aware
[5:41:00] Vetto_7: i would not play it without addons
[5:41:02] Curtsy: Addons don't always need an api to work
[5:41:14] Curtsy: lots of addons just read game files
[5:41:15] hotmanpop: @RedTheEpic th content isnt HARD tho
[5:41:15] Donzle: @RedTheEpic you are the problem
[5:41:18] zak618: FirstTimeChatter
[5:41:18] shurublues: there's allways a way, cheaters will allways exists
[5:41:22] the_teleporter: cooldown trackers dont exist on any other competitive game with them, LoL, OW, DOTA - I think it adds a good layer of skill to be able to mentally track a few people's cooldowns
[5:41:22] mealtiime: gnomer = hard content KEKZ
[5:41:26] Qrucials: Gnomeregan, the HARD content

[5:41:51] Lecxion: PREACH
[5:41:53] mr_az3k: GIGACHAD
[5:41:58] light_of_heart: playing the game vs completing content Keepo
[5:41:58] rainmannxz: GIGACHAD
[5:41:59] Swayvuh: but you should expect to play the piano at a show on the contrary
[5:42:02] My_keI: some ppl dont try and they dont learn from their mistakes
[5:42:07] mealtiime: not everyone is born Echo raider
[5:42:08] mr_az3k: the Joey Swolle of WoW
[5:42:14] jokaa199: u need 20 year wow exp for gnoma
[5:42:16] Difcar: So do you think an orchestra should invite someone to play the piano without any prior experience?
[5:42:16] Vir0n: noobs RISE UP peepoRiot
[5:42:16] Lecxion: man's got elitist mentality
[5:42:19] QwQGolden: speak for yourself 0 exp 0 gear 1 shot the last boss some are naturally gifted ApuSpy
[5:42:19] magnus03001: rank 2 parser here fuck the logs off its toxic and hurts new players also rather not be spying out of numbers on some website made by a guy who doesn’t even play the game anymore Baseg
[5:42:26] timeoutandy: noobs should just create their own noob guild and do noob content together with their noob friends
[5:42:27] happyheals: gdkp
[5:42:28] kreeezy: People don't want to progress anymore kill or leave its way different then back in thebdays
[5:42:28] MrDeadDorian: @Ziqoftw what do you mean by 'you were a noob" ? im still a noob ziqoW ziqoW
[5:42:29] bassiemon123: We got to learn the next gen
[5:42:29] Castlebaarr: they get old KEKW
[5:42:31] atromere: @RedTheEpic maybe dont play an mmo lmao
[5:42:32] maddhatterr: but @Ziqoftw you have to watch videos of encounters, read strats online and study for 72 hours intensively before raids Kappa
[5:42:33] shurublues: that's a great take
[5:42:35] zimma88: Amen
[5:42:37] Donzle: yeah but then how else are we supposed to get an ego boost?
[5:42:38] RedTheEpic: I'm just saying DPS meters AT THE MINIMUM. You need to be able to measure performance in  content that's meant to be HARD. I am not saying for all content.
[5:42:44] kusoneko: ff14 is very very very welcoming to noobs
[5:42:46] MazzleTV: people act like doing dps in wow is rocket science... what determines your dps is just your gear, class and rng on procs unless you're complete shit
[5:42:54] patrikpetrak2: I love how people cry there is nobody to play with and game is dead, but when somebody want to play the game  as newbie they are not alloved
[5:43:01] yatazuchimar: yup just play the game, its just a freaking game for most people, nothing more
[5:43:04] p_fet: classic content should be easy imo
[5:43:15] bassiemon123: All the pve andys malding rn
[5:43:20] hotmanpop: yeah joining a guild and playing with people you like talking to on discord is the best way to play this old ass game
[5:43:21] Tal_NeonFlame: Because people who are used to blame others, dont survive in good guilds.
[5:43:22] immerscharf: im hosting raids every reset. didnt look at gearscore or logs once. cleared it multiple times now.
[5:43:23] happyheals: ah it seems like in retail steps are being taken towards thatye
[5:43:24] mealtiime: dont remove my VuhDo Sadge it makes healing enjoyable
[5:43:25] JUMJUMnoMi: noobs can join, thing is the self entitled noobs that are not teachable because apply dongeon logic and sign-up and don't commit in the minimum ways for raiding
[5:43:25] Omgezzz: would be great.....base in game
[5:43:27] Vir0n: dps meters are fine logs are cringe
[5:43:28] Omgezzz: instead of addons
[5:43:32] Carcer69: @p_fet classic content is easy
[5:43:42] hobbehesu: When i was 14 and started raiding i had to heal with manual raid frames, that shit was harder than anything ive ever done in WoW
[5:43:43] Swayvuh: they'd need to put the new retail ui in the game
[5:43:50] dinkleminkle: finally got into a gnomer holy shitta
[5:43:57] FrankieNOR: dps started in 2004, meters still not implemented NotLikeThis
[5:44:00] stillfly: @hobbehesu what are manual raid frames?
[5:44:04] bassiemon123: Reee thats a no
[5:44:10] happyheals: but if you pay for 2 years of game time you can use add ons an extra year longer
[5:44:12] mealtiime: no more scroll wheel tagging KEKZ
[5:44:16] bassiemon123: Macro's that where i draw the line xd
[5:44:21] hobbehesu: @stillfly the default drag and drop bars from the raid interface LUL
[5:44:23] hobbehesu: it was really scuffed
[5:44:24] orange_bean: dude all this shit is client side why does it matter, just dont use it if you have problems
[5:44:39] JUMJUMnoMi: the noobs that got carried by guildies run they pug in, or with their shiddy alt and still expect the same result they have with their main raid lol
[5:44:49] hotmanpop: BRUH
[5:44:49] kusoneko: low iq take
[5:44:50] FLUGMANGO: Pepega
[5:44:51] Donzle: thats a 2head take if ive ever seen it
[5:44:58] stillfly: @hobbehesu the current default ones are more than enough to clearn mythic raids though no?
[5:44:58] happyheals: people just gotta stop comparing themselves to .0001% of the player base
[5:45:02] Carcer69: @orange_bean youre really stupid
[5:45:07] slippery87: 2head vibes
[5:45:09] danparsonss: just use a shitty green bow when you have that fat epic gun to use ziqo
[5:45:16] Vir0n: did he just reacted to your 30-minute video??? LUL
[5:45:17] FLUGMANGO: KEKW
[5:45:18] bassiemon123: LUL
[5:45:21] hotmanpop: ACTUALLY HIM
[5:45:22] QwQGolden: cooked lmao
[5:45:23] stillfly: but maybe the used to suck alot
[5:45:25] hobbehesu: @stillfly im talking about 2005 raiding, vanilla not anything related to mythic or retail or anything
[5:45:36] hobbehesu: like 1st week BWL launch raiding
[5:45:43] stillfly: @hobbehesu oh yeah I realized you're most likely talking about back in the days
[5:45:50] poopooindiaper: Good evening, i just accidentally shat myself
[5:45:56] hobbehesu: FeelsOldMan :)
[5:46:02] Vir0n: Old ziqo PogT
[5:46:03] kusoneko: editor didnt include him Disconnecting, it was confusing for a bit
[5:46:05] Machinecoach: beach chair was the best line in AWC casting history
[5:46:06] hotmanpop: you didnt put it in your video :(
[5:46:14] Difcar: @Ziqoftw If you had gatekept that raid more you'd have more chance on loot, a shorter raid and gone 6/6. That's why people do it.
[5:46:19] jokaa199: mage solo healing is balls
[5:46:21] Jdmqx: @Ziqoftw they are tuning bosses on retail keeping in mind people will use addons and wa's and if they would disable addons completely, they would have to make encounters way easier for the top guilds to clear it and it won't look as epic...I have no other explanation as of why they don't disable them
[5:46:27] mealtiime: @Difcar KEKZ
[5:46:28] bassiemon123: Asmon has some caveman takes LUL
[5:46:35] hotmanpop: yeah you skipped when it happens, but talk about it after
[5:46:36] Rexdel_: Rexdel_ subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 2 months, currently on a 1 month streak! 
[5:46:38] kusoneko: yea but it just cut from last boss to right now, was confusing
[5:46:41] happyheals: 2 spriest and a shammy or mage is fine
[5:46:43] hobbehesu: Its like Mimiron 0.5
[5:46:46] Lirrok: its kinda hard to follow which ziqo is currently talking lol
[5:46:58] Machinecoach: Lontar oom
[5:47:05] Machinecoach: trill 2v3
[5:47:11] hotmanpop: LULW
[5:47:14] Vir0n: damn I miss the old ziqo Sadge
[5:47:16] chipm_: which one is real
[5:47:23] danparsonss: both ziqos sound the same
[5:47:25] danparsonss: confusing
[5:47:30] happyheals: it is a trick, the real Ziqo is Asmon
[5:47:32] body_type_two: both are fake Kappa
[5:47:34] magnus03001: @jdmqx spot on bro it almost way too late but it should still be done
[5:47:38] timeoutandy: @Difcar so true, the ppl saying otherwise are just complaining to complain. Even if they cant get invites cuz no log, no parse, no exp. Can either join a guild or create their own pug and problem solved. They just putting minimal effort as usual and complain
[5:47:38] PutridFart: @chipm_ ziqo was never real
[5:47:40] Truthseeker96: lol
[5:47:54] Gruusader: Gruusader subscribed with Prime. 
[5:47:54] Jdmqx: @magnus03001 Iagree
[5:48:13] Truthseeker96: we do lol
[5:48:15] happyheals: yep
[5:48:21] javamonkeyj: Bro the DC didnt matter
[5:48:25] happyheals: you did fine my dude
[5:48:25] Difcar: A good raid can easily 9 man it though
[5:48:27] javamonkeyj: you guys werent doing mechanics
[5:48:28] dfau1t: We would have been fine if we didn't lose the heLer
[5:48:42] garbagekidttv: iHATEgaycen
[5:48:59] prismo5: i didnt clear first 2 IDs because of people DCing at last 2 bosses Sadge
[5:49:01] fanofthebanhammer: yeah  a good raid can 9man, our healer dced and we killed all 9-man (but yeah i only took good ppl)
[5:49:17] Ageond: Unlucky raid
[5:49:18] jokaa199: it was poggers
[5:49:19] Truthseeker96: @Difcar Yeah, they can easily 10man and 1 shot everything. I even dced on the last boss 2 lockouts ago and they finished the raid with 9man
[5:49:19] Sephy11: its been 6 manned alrdy lol
[5:49:24] Qrucials: is this live ziqo or past ziqo talking now
[5:49:25] magnus03001: @ziqoftw we had clients in osrs and for a long time jagex just turned a blind eye but they flat out said we are now banning for 3rd party clients they saw what happened to wow etc and just nipped it in the bud
[5:49:25] happyheals: I wonder when a lock solos this boss?
[5:49:33] timeoutandy: "DC" also known as doing something else cuz cba this shit
[5:49:43] Truthseeker96: a learner raid
[5:49:44] javamonkeyj: That directly goes against your point of the video tho bro. The premise is you DONT NEED a good group to do the dungeons and you DIDNT do the dungeon.
[5:49:50] jokaa199: 5 man grp on the  4th i wanna see
[5:50:00] Difcar: It's not criticism, you had fun and did a raid your way. The point is that it makes perfect sense for players to be picky with their dps
[5:50:20] snazzle87: so if you take a bunch of players that make up "not a good group" why would a raid leader not be selective if trying to make a "good group"
[5:50:31] timeoutandy: u dont need, but its way more benifical and less time spent so its just better
[5:50:32] QwQGolden: 30 mins and some people not getting it CLASSIC
[5:50:33] Difcar: Meta speccs and checking logs helps get a better group and improves your odds
[5:50:36] Truthseeker96: you just need ppl who have a brain and do mechanics LBVS
[5:50:38] javamonkeyj: So you dont need meta but you do need to be good?
[5:50:41] Truthseeker96: who cares about the dps
[5:50:41] jokaa199: meta andys
[5:50:43] j03seph: results oriented thinking yep
[5:50:44] OptimusPrimePleb: ppl so butthurt thinking this game is somehow hard KEKW
[5:50:50] SailazarAY: POGGERS
[5:50:56] cannabiis4: how is the black wizard doing?
[5:50:58] r3muz: @jokaa199 o7
[5:51:00] ZEXbbot: the point is, its not really worth the effor tto be so selective when all u have to do is just communicate and be patient
[5:51:02] 0bbie: elitists in chat LUL
[5:51:11] Disord3r: you need a healer meta group or not lmao
[5:51:14] happyheals: Where is the Arabian Warrior and his cousin?
[5:51:19] grylz89: Have a 🧠
[5:51:23] jhk97: be present and dont troll
[5:51:29] FrankieNOR: read tooltip, press 123 thats it
[5:51:32] magnus03001: most classic wow players are borderline tarted they fear any sort of prog KEKL
[5:51:39] mealtiime: just dont stand in fire and you are top 1% classic raider
[5:51:40] hobbehesu: Thats the beauty of raiding, wiping, learning, overcoming, looting
[5:51:45] Hawksworthers: considering it was near the start of the phase so gear wasn't as good and it was down to 9 man it was a good attempt
[5:51:45] wowalbi: i mean thats a big cap though some people are literal demons
[5:51:45] 88davdav88: have more than 5 braincells and dont puss out over a wipe
[5:51:46] rainmannxz: people have not raided retail they don't have a frame of reference
[5:51:48] Difcar: Week 1 kelris with pugs people got hardstuck, even after 20 wipes
[5:51:48] Carcer69: gnomer has a total of 5 mechanics KEKL
[5:51:49] kinkyspatula: Meta Andys absolutely HATE having to play the game, it should be braindead easy.
[5:51:52] Truthseeker96: I just witnessed an ass load of bombs going out on that clip btw
[5:51:52] happyheals: cogwheels and ground effect dmg
[5:51:58] ParfumAmerican: we can't see
[5:52:00] jokaa199: kill adds
[5:52:01] hiro25000: Four Horseman can take more than 10 pulls if you do not know the fight
[5:52:04] magnus03001: THE RAID HAS MYTHIC 0 mechanics KEKL
[5:52:04] jokaa199: douge
[5:52:04] Truthseeker96: you could of turned around and clicked the button at any time
[5:52:11] Iceman102060: whats really stupid is ppl being so afraid to wipe jfc its a game
[5:52:31] light_of_heart: wipe = damage to self image
[5:52:34] Difcar: @Iceman102060 People aren't afraid to wipe, they are afraid they won't complete the raid and miss out on loot
[5:52:36] ZEXbbot: exactly, its jsut an fing game. i swear yall treat this like its real life job interviews
[5:52:38] grylz89: The issue is ppl are so crutched by WBs. They think after WBs are lost, oh welp throw in the towel we can't kill it
[5:52:40] jhk97: i feel like u only need to pay some attention on the 5th boss
[5:52:44] javamonkeyj: Yes I agree its easy. But its undeniable that the last 2 bosses are signficantly harder than the first 4.
[5:52:44] prismo5: not knowing to interrupt in p3 would be fatal tbf but ye I agree
[5:52:47] Jarkeler: MC level mechanics
[5:52:50] Truthseeker96: Grubbis actually enrages i believe
[5:52:53] ryu_mmo: true
[5:52:55] mealtiime: @Difcar och no i lost chance to win a loot in 3 day lockout of lvl 40 raid
[5:53:01] happyheals: that is where you hit the player enrage timers
[5:53:03] magnus03001: @iceman102060 world buffs make it that way more so it’s very annoying since it’s fun to play with them
[5:53:17] madjolie: payoLove payoLove  telling the truth Ziqo payoLove Kappa
[5:53:17] paco__gutierrez: @truthseeker96 that's a percentage rage not on a timer
[5:53:23] Difcar: World buffs are stupid, especially the DMF one where you have to afk for 2 hours
[5:53:29] hiro25000: Imagine what pugs will ask for Naxx
[5:53:32] grylz89: @ziqoftw The issue is ppl are so crutched by WBs. They think after WBs are lost, oh welp throw in the towel we can't kill it. Terrible mind set sadly.
[5:53:33] GrandmasCloset: ziqo this video is great
[5:53:37] ZEXbbot: its giving "you need 5 years prior exp for this unpaid internship" and thats not a good look, like ever feelsweirdman
[5:53:55] happyheals: Ray J hit it first
[5:53:57] jhk97: @Difcar world buffs are great, therye not needed but make the gameplay more fun, until you lose them kek
[5:54:01] paco__gutierrez: Anal
[5:54:08] hxzcc: i was happy too when i finally got invited after 5h to my first gnomer yday
[5:54:13] magnus03001: KEKL
[5:54:13] hobbehesu: Milkman LUL
[5:54:15] jokaa199: milkman
[5:54:15] Hawksworthers: F Milkman KEKZ
[5:54:15] maddhatterr: I love this part KEKW
[5:54:28] timeoutandy: Toxic behavior LUL
[5:54:33] dinkleminkle: my favorite fucking part
[5:54:37] Meatchopper: KEKW
[5:54:39] hobbehesu: hahahahah
[5:54:41] Meatchopper: so good
[5:54:48] patrikpetrak2: we had a guild run during the tbc and both of our tanks were brothers living at the same apartment and they interned died mid raid, raid was over, thats how it is
[5:54:49] OptimusPrimePleb: LUL i never saw this part
[5:54:55] jhk97: lmao
[5:54:55] KKonaStevieG: KEKW
[5:55:07] Carcer69: so the autist tryhard group didnt clear it faster than you damn
[5:55:20] fanofthebanhammer: @Carcer69 Ziqo didnt clear?
[5:55:28] magnus03001: KEKL
[5:55:29] timeoutandy: true
[5:55:34] wreckstormx: KEKG
[5:55:36] jokaa199: true
[5:55:42] danparsonss: hes dumb tho
[5:55:48] Carcer69: @fanofthebanhammer yeah but ziqo played with randoms and a dc
[5:55:51] danparsonss: it resets in 20 minutes after they finished
[5:55:54] Difcar: Asmon gatekeeps the hell out of every raid, just like almost any raid leader
[5:55:57] danparsonss: so youre not locked
[5:56:17] christiangodwarrior97: yea raid ids are trash
[5:56:18] fanofthebanhammer: @Carcer69 im not saying anything against that, im just saying it is kinda incorrect to say he cleared, when he didnt
[5:56:24] the_jot: ziqoW here we go
[5:56:26] jhk97: @Difcar asmon is kind of known for getting carried, its kind of his thing, ofcourse he only wants good players to carry him xD
[5:56:26] danparsonss: he missed the point it resets in like an hour after you finish
[5:56:30] magnus03001: I agree raiding ids are dog shit KEKL
[5:56:33] danparsonss: the point is to get some loot before reset
[5:56:49] Thecustomdude: SOD should be to have fun and not sweat about it. Very easy gameplay. If you wanna sweat in wow retail and go do mythic raid or m+ 26 and higher.
[5:57:10] ash_p94: ????????????
[5:57:12] KKonaStevieG: -millenials KEKW
[5:57:14] jhk97: @Thecustomdude you can sweat in any game if you want to, dont gatekeep
[5:57:14] Carcer69: @fanofthebanhammer Ah I see it was worded badly I didnt mean to say that ziqo cleared it I just wanted to say that the logchecking clowns didnt clear it faster
[5:57:15] OptimusPrimePleb: omg ten minutes!
[5:57:16] fanofthebanhammer: @Thecustomdude What if sweat if fun? Are they not allowed their way of fun?
[5:57:21] jokaa199: yes
[5:57:32] GrandmasCloset: he really dont play wow anymore does he
[5:57:35] christiangodwarrior97: @OptimusPrimePleb wipe 4 times and thats 40 minutes spent doing nothing
[5:57:38] Racazar: getting to and from wipes and dungeons is not the problem, this guy is clueless
[5:57:41] OptimusPrimePleb: BWL wipes sucked ass, this not so much
[5:57:45] paco__gutierrez: Asmon has been carried through everything he's ever done
[5:57:45] GrandmasCloset: the weebs won
[5:57:46] Truthseeker96: @Thecustomdude if we wanna sweat in SoD we can. We all pay a sub
[5:57:50] COMMEdesRATS: summoning players into a dungeon = killing wpvp
[5:57:50] mealtiime: No summing stones Sadge
[5:57:59] optional_advice: @fanofthebanhammer i think you hit the core issue here. the sweaty people should be sweaty and thats totally cool.
[5:58:00] jokaa199: normal summ works?
[5:58:01] jhk97: @OptimusPrimePleb 15 min break on nefarian wipe KEKW
[5:58:05] Korvynah: "Game is not spoonfeeding me everything easy, issue number 1"
[5:58:09] magnus03001: @grandmascloset he won’t give blizzard the free advertising KEKL blizzard have been feeding us shit for years
[5:58:13] zak618: being able to use other groups closets are big
[5:58:22] christiangodwarrior97: @COMMEdesRATS how in the world is that killing wpvp
[5:58:23] optional_advice: but the not sweaty people shouldnt have to be ridiculed for not being sweaty and called dogshit by randoms all the time
[5:58:27] ManWhoStands: look mom! im on the interwebs
[5:58:27] OptimusPrimePleb: @jhk97 bro i hated those runbacks, i'd always try to autorun it but get stuck on some hill or someshit KEKW
[5:58:27] jokaa199: IF to gnome is not far ^^
[5:58:29] GrandmasCloset: @magnus03001 good point
[5:58:29] hobbehesu: Goblino
[5:58:31] hobbehesu: :))
[5:58:32] happyheals: they trieed have group will summon for guilds
[5:58:35] voncline88: I don't really like these takes.  Getting to the dungeon and losing buffs is part of the game.  It makes the game more challenging obv.  It's already so easy, why does he want it easier
[5:58:36] happyheals: people abused it
[5:58:36] Dalbo420: @zak618 If you're the dominant faction
[5:58:37] COMMEdesRATS: @christiangodwarrior97 people stay in major cities waiting for summons?
[5:58:39] Stars69: wait dont let other classes use polymorph scroll tho
[5:58:48] jokaa199: stv gnome port
[5:58:57] GrandmasCloset: locks always eat EZ
[5:58:59] jhk97: @OptimusPrimePleb one time i actually used the 15 mins to get a new Ony and Songflower buff KEKW
[5:58:59] COMMEdesRATS: @christiangodwarrior97 like hello? lol
[5:59:02] the_jot: monkaS warlock mafia
[5:59:02] christiangodwarrior97: @COMMEdesRATS m8 nobody running to their raid is trying to engage in wpvp. or doing wpvp for thatmatter
[5:59:05] Genghish: 3g/summon is no chill
[5:59:06] Medifaded: Really not agreeing with a lot of Asmon's takes here. Most the time I do agree
[5:59:10] rainmannxz: danse
[5:59:11] padierman: little competition is healthy
[5:59:17] OptimusPrimePleb: @jhk97 200iq lmao
[5:59:19] COMMEdesRATS: @christiangodwarrior97 u don't get it tho
[5:59:21] ash_p94: Asmons takes so far on this notepad are terrible
[5:59:21] magnus03001: just don’t pay them EZ
[5:59:25] zak618: warlocks charging 2-3g is criminal
[5:59:26] Venomsneaks: 4g
[5:59:26] jokaa199: if u want enter a location warlock alrdy there ^^
[5:59:26] Vir0n: Vibewarlock
[5:59:26] p_fet: i use them for summons then just dont pay :)
[5:59:34] christiangodwarrior97: @COMMEdesRATS how much wpvp have u done in gmoergan
[5:59:35] PermaGrinnn: assman even play this anymore?
[5:59:36] Truthseeker96: summons are not an issue either btw
[5:59:36] Carcer69: @p_fet Based
[5:59:37] cookie_jayy: i would just not pay fuck them
[5:59:38] wowalbi: @magnus03001 friend got 3day ban cuz of not paying the sum
[5:59:39] rainmannxz: HAHAHAHA
[5:59:41] Jarkeler: I charge 99 silver
[5:59:41] jokaa199: what
[5:59:42] Ageond: Wa
[5:59:46] Meatchopper: if other classes get summon why not give other classes tame beast? or execute? my point? where is the line drawn?
[5:59:55] SlimPhiLord: shards are rare these days...
[5:59:58] rainmannxz: HAHAHAHA YES
[5:59:59] Ageond: LUL
[5:59:59] hiro25000: If you find the two clickers I summon for free
[5:59:59] MrDeadDorian: warlocks mafia
[6:00:00] hotmanpop: YES LULW
[6:00:03] jokaa199: hahaah
[6:00:03] JamesIRL: i charge 1g like a normal persoon
[6:00:05] SBGTentacleMonster: @p_fet good plan. my warlock wont summon anybody that i am not raiding with.
[6:00:09] Disord3r: man is hustling lmao
[6:00:12] magnus03001: @p_fet most of them have my alts on the ignore KEL
[6:00:16] thunderedqt: you know if ziqo had a lock he’d be charging 10g for a Premium Summon
[6:00:18] zak618: mages charging 75s for ports while locks charge 3g
[6:00:18] timeoutandy: I bought 10 Folex watches from there that lasted 2hours :)
[6:00:19] rainmannxz: The village hustlers !
[6:00:22] happyheals: All I do is travel for work
[6:00:27] Truthseeker96: @Meatchopper fr tho and they forget that you can literally get to the raid in 10 mins
[6:00:27] Ronafca: or those guys that sell u a cheap rose for 5 bucks
[6:00:27] jokaa199: this guys in holdays that sell u bullshit for 100$
[6:00:29] Ageond: I do for free if they got clickers
[6:00:31] happyheals: People need that gold for summons
[6:00:33] jhk97: apparently some warlocks spam report all other warlocks who undercut their summon price, not sure if its true tho
[6:00:34] COMMEdesRATS: @christiangodwarrior97 use your brain dude, if u can summon inside any dungeon/raid then there's less people in the world heading towards that instance therefore LESS wpvp
[6:00:42] Rakgthora: Asmon is the ultima casual
[6:00:43] JUMJUMnoMi: price go up beccause clickers as for more 1!! its the clickers fault here ! Kappa
[6:00:43] kataxxx: oh he's talking about the big Z i just came
[6:00:49] JUMJUMnoMi: ask** for more
[6:01:00] OptimusPrimePleb: ppl mad about time in WoW is kind of low key funny
[6:01:08] GrandmasCloset: idk why i fuicking play classic i fucking hate raiding imagine having to pay atentiopn to a fuckign video game for 2 hours fuck that shit
[6:01:09] christiangodwarrior97: @COMMEdesRATS how much wpvp do u get against people that are summoning players outside the dungeon then
[6:01:10] happyheals: Massochism
[6:01:13] KKonaStevieG: why play the game at all? KEKW
[6:01:16] Truthseeker96: Hey man if i had to make my way to the raid than so do you
[6:01:19] Tdogggg1: sadly we cleared it in 36min with a pug
[6:01:25] jhk97: @GrandmasCloset yeah if thats too much for you, its time to quit
[6:01:30] Shepp22: for funzies with the boys
[6:01:30] timeoutandy: true why risk 2-4hours and still fail when u can 6/6 in 1 hour 100% certain with just checking logs LUL
[6:01:32] st0neh: I really don't understand this argument, there are plenty of raids for people of all skill and gear levels
[6:01:35] Difcar: Aren't you worried people will start selling carries if you remove the lockout?
[6:01:43] magnus03001: I’m in the process of editing a weak aura to mass reports summoners through blizzards api EZ
[6:01:44] JUMJUMnoMi: @GrandmasCloset did you just woke up ? welcome to the stream
[6:01:46] COMMEdesRATS: @christiangodwarrior97 how do you not understand? it's really simple KEKL
[6:01:47] iPlayCuzFun: ï got 2 40's , one i always do parse runs, the other i always do noob friendly raids. fun to have both
[6:01:50] GrandmasCloset: @jhk97 yeah nah fuck pve ill do open world Bgs whatever
[6:01:55] lemonchilllll: what do you mean by the lockouts thing? that each boss has its own ID?
[6:02:04] tylersquareee: should be banned for 2 weeks if u leave a raid early
[6:02:08] Vir0n: selling
[6:02:08] danparsonss: selling loot
[6:02:09] andyloltv: maybe im stupid but i like how raid lockouts work on retail
[6:02:13] happyheals: they should make a system where you can q for a version of the raid that matches you with other players/roles
[6:02:22] Truthseeker96: GDKPs are banned 100%
[6:02:24] Carcer69: @lemonchilllll yeah in retail you are loot locked per boss so you can enter a different raid and still get loot from bosses you did not kill
[6:02:24] mealtiime: @andyloltv retail raid lockouts are the best
[6:02:31] christiangodwarrior97: @COMMEdesRATS yea i dont understand what u are yapping about xd
[6:02:32] Truthseeker96: idk about the loot part
[6:02:41] JamesIRL: oh shit. I just sold a piece from bfd because a guy messaged me. allegedly btw

[6:03:17] st0neh: Why is Asmon even talking about a game he doesn't play lol
[6:03:17] mealtiime: M+ in retail group finder is Bis
[6:03:22] Scamran: wrath group finder only clicking people with max gs KEKZ
[6:03:24] imraduin: yep
[6:03:31] ggbr0sky: that would make no diffrence
[6:03:31] Shepp22: LFG bulliten board basically
[6:03:31] Difcar: That's the retail group finder without LFR
[6:03:38] OptimusPrimePleb: @st0neh free content?
[6:03:42] st0neh: Shouldn't he be dropping terrible takes on react content KEKW
[6:03:43] PermaGrinnn: y we listen to someone how doesnt play, rather than y he talking about it :D
[6:03:46] happyheals: We need ai party solo q
[6:03:47] Carcer69: @KonzKonz does it matter? he has probably 1500+ days played I think his opinion is somewhat valid
[6:03:50] Dunderkat: @christiangodwarrior97 I've literally never pvped on my way to Gnomeregan and maybe did once or twice to BFD. idk what blud is on about
[6:03:51] jhk97: @st0neh isnt that 90% of what asmon does
[6:03:52] hiro25000: it's the best middle ground solution
[6:03:56] Ageond: Wrath there is interaction
[6:03:57] magnus03001: that’s retail lfr wraith is just listing
[6:03:57] AllPurposeCleaner: i feel like asmon needs to play more wow again to sharpen up his takes
[6:03:58] Fuwahta: Like a hub
[6:04:01] Jarkeler: @st0neh What do you think he's doing here? lul
[6:04:10] hiro25000: hamdoula
[6:04:19] st0neh: @Jarkeler I guess you have a point Kappa
[6:04:37] Difcar: Retail has the same group finder where people make and list individual groups and apply to them

[6:04:54] st0neh: Why wouldn't Ziqo be an egirl? If so it'd be much easier for Asmon he just has to simp then
[6:04:54] hotmanpop: you can't sub to zackrawr LULW
[6:04:56] clogan06: lmao

[6:05:32] happyheals: happyheals gifted a Tier 1 sub to oglevvyy! They have given 6 Gift Subs in the channel! 
[6:05:48] KonzKonz: @Carcer69 i dont agree , personnally i think hes toxic and his current takes ruin the game . he just complains even though he doesnt play
[6:05:49] magnus03001: Yeap
[6:05:50] st0neh: Oh god here we go, let's say the thing that fucked the economy and got us in this place is good KEKW
[6:06:02] Meatchopper: @GrandmasCloset he doesn't need much .. simple man, simple life
[6:06:07] Jumpka: @ziqoftw have you seen the video qhere asmon finds out how much it costs twitch to run his stream? LUL
[6:06:09] Bobka: @Ziqoftw Sent you cool dm on discord if you saw that
[6:06:12] Stoupt14: Our guild gives out the loot at the end of the raid
[6:06:13] PermaGrinnn: drama milker ResidentSleeper
[6:06:15] jhk97: hold loot until raid is cleared, easy as that
[6:06:16] Stoupt14: can do that in pugs
[6:06:28] Carcer69: @KonzKonz I mean he has some good and some retarded takes im not saying every take is a good one
[6:06:28] jvizzey: runbacks are nothing...
[6:06:32] Jarkeler: @Bobka I saw it, thanks :)
[6:06:36] magnus03001: you can’t remove gdkps without adding something to game to prevent people from just leaving
[6:06:41] dinkleminkle: holding loot until the end is probably the best thing to do, and generally dont mind it one bit
[6:06:43] the_jot: KEKZ so just unban gdkp to fix the game?
[6:06:45] st0neh: Short version Asmon costs Twitch almost $2m a year KEKW

[6:08:18] Meatchopper: yes .. just yes
[6:08:19] Bobka: no reset , sadly
[6:08:23] st0neh: This could be a hint that Blizzard has a duel tournwey coming @Ziqoftw
[6:08:30] hobbehesu: @XzilTv he is only playing on NA SoD atm LUL
[6:08:31] PermaGrinnn: damn, thought we was done
[6:08:34] Bobka: Looks like it
[6:08:41] happyheals: they reset if you die though\
[6:08:42] MrMowf: do you think its interesting at all that the effect on the bloodgods sword can be found on another higher level quest item?   "soul claim" (spell on wowhead reads the same) @Bobka @Ziqoftw
[6:08:48] Fuwahta: YEP
[6:08:51] Carcer69: the classic wow team is actually doing a lot of stuff
[6:08:52] jhk97: im not gonna play hardcore but i want this in SoD
[6:08:53] malledoge420: ye i was thinking this would be epic in sod
[6:08:53] xaaaaa: ye pretty much YEP
[6:08:57] Jarkeler: Ctrl+C > Ctrl+V ez
[6:08:59] JUMJUMnoMi: copy pasta !
[6:09:02] Speyto: maybe they start with soft launch to test it
[6:09:04] ub3rm0nk3y: it's technically the same build, with checkboxes to turn things on and off
[6:09:08] Ronafca: add blood moon to hardcore xdd
[6:09:11] Bobka: Ya Xaryu doing same and Savix
[6:09:15] mealtiime: @Ronafca KEKZ

[6:09:33] Speyto: True Clap
[6:09:34] Jarkeler: Yeah they are doing good with communication too
[6:09:36] tooxie: can you avoid someone healing you mid duel?
[6:09:37] happyheals: make a softcore wow mode where you get a 24 hour 10% stat loss every time you die
[6:09:38] BlazyFM: 1vs1 league
[6:09:44] Jimmy_wr: LUL LUL
[6:09:44] SailazarAY: true
[6:09:45] st0neh: SoD needs some serious balance right now but they've been pretty good fixing other shit6 so faer

[6:09:49] Meatchopper: YEPPERS
[6:09:51] jhk97: shoutout to the SoD devs, its not perfect but its really good!
[6:09:54] Ronafca: for sure, and u know blizzard is giving them absolute minimal resources to do so too
[6:09:56] jvizzey: wow devs have had infinite good ideas over the last 20 years to work from. ideas are like 90% of the work
[6:10:01] SailazarAY: POGGERS
[6:10:02] MitchskiD: yo Ziqo
[6:10:07] BlazyFM: no fuckin way deam @bobka when did u ffind that
[6:10:12] Fuwahta: EZ tournament in this duel zone
[6:10:18] loppeo: for the first time ever it seems like the devs are listening to the community POGGERS
[6:10:30] airinsurgent89: Casually oh the hottest dudes follow me back.
[6:10:40] Jarkeler: Think Microsoft is giving classic team more freedom?
[6:10:44] magnus03001: Sod lacks balance sod has major botting problems the world pvp is mid and boring
[6:10:52] Fuwahta: There
[6:10:54] GrandmasCloset: they need to make retail pvp mothefucking easier fucking que 1200 i get pikaboo and 2.7k multiglads
[6:10:55] hiro25000: I can confirm you that it is live on HC. I have the same goblin in front of me in front of Orgrimmar
[6:10:57] jhk97: outside Ironforge
[6:11:00] Difcar: Is the horde one in front of ogri?
[6:11:01] BlazyFM: yooo this would be sooo dope
[6:11:01] jhk97: wich is usually deadge
[6:11:04] jokaa199: arena
[6:11:08] SailazarAY: EZ Clap
[6:11:09] iPlayCuzFun: is it horde and ally duel zone?
[6:11:12] LuckyLambCow: INSANE
[6:11:14] BlazyFM: its warrior quest
[6:11:15] hobbehesu: Clap
[6:11:18] jhk97: hopefully the duel scene is back
[6:11:21] Jumpka: private servers were implementing cool ideas for like 20 years and classic is kinda like official pserver, its really nice
[6:11:21] Scamran: i really like that they contanstly patching classes keeps it refreshing, classic 2019 kinda felt bad releasing on the newest patch
[6:11:22] magnus03001: sod devs L
[6:11:24] st0neh: SoD team just need to fix the damage v health right now lol
[6:11:51] crumb321: that man should definitely open more tabs

[6:12:13] Fuwahta: Callout
[6:12:14] hiro25000: a little respect for the content creator
[6:12:16] magnus03001: grey screen pov
[6:12:21] happyheals: it is extra emphasis
[6:12:21] malledoge420: haha
[6:12:22] JUMJUMnoMi: not ppc Asmon
[6:12:23] DemowCS: If you only need one boss and dont have ID, you will leave and queue another group until your items drops. It's quite simple.
[6:12:23] st0neh: All that grey screen looks like a Payo screen Kappa
[6:12:36] JamesIRL: if the person doesnt care about the rest of the bosses, why would they care about their raid lock anyway? chatters point is noot good
[6:12:39] Jarkeler: Tell editor to always cut grey screens
[6:13:11] Not_J_o_n: you should be locked to a boss not the raid
[6:13:43] Difcar: In classic those are the same though
[6:13:44] magnus03001: why to stop people selling loot I would join to help people get clears I did that in lfr sometimes when I was bored in retail
[6:13:45] st0neh: None of these issues he's waffling about are anywhere near big enough to warrant this much discussion lol
[6:13:48] happyheals: I feel like they would have maybe addressed this issue in retail
[6:14:09] Bobka: https://clips.twitch.tv/FurtiveVenomousOrcaSmoocherZ-WUWWISNiW00nmUTj thats what it looks like fuking hype man
[6:14:40] Sleepylol93: Im so tired, i thought i was watching asmon react to ziqo not the otherway around LUL LUL LUL NotLikeThis
[6:14:45] DemowCS: @JamesIRL it wont fully prevent it but you've ID so you'll stay anyway like during classic.
[6:14:51] Difcar: @happyheals In retail you have a loot lockout on individual bosses in normal/heroic
[6:14:59] Jarkeler: That duel area is so dope
[6:15:11] happyheals: I know, I'm being a turd
[6:15:20] magnus03001: Nar just loot lock people
[6:15:22] ParfumAmerican: you can join but can't loot the one you are saved
[6:15:28] st0neh: That can be an issue with raids where the bosses aren't all in order though
[6:15:41] optional_advice: why not just lock to bosses you have killed? like... why lock thme out of a boss they didnt kill? let them potentially rekill a boss but just not be able to accept loot from it
[6:15:46] Bobka: you can invite your own raid
[6:15:48] Speyto: Already layering prob KEKZ
[6:15:53] Bobka: and you dont get crowded
[6:15:53] happyheals: looks like you fell under the map in searing gorge
[6:16:04] Dunderkat: oh shit so you can do duel tournaments
[6:16:08] WaterBoxx: @Ziqoftw hey bro, which addon would you recommend for spell procs like Pyro
[6:16:17] timeoutandy: lol same layer takes away the whole point no? LUL
[6:16:23] jhk97: id prefer no layers there
[6:16:33] Carcer69: yeah
[6:16:35] Jarkeler: That area needs a road like durotar
[6:16:36] malledoge420: yeah
[6:16:41] happyheals: make it instanced
[6:16:43] Bendetto398: yo where is pilar in this zone?
[6:16:43] Sleepylol93: Just Boss lockout is good, you can do the boss but u wont be able to get the loot
[6:16:45] Ronafca: think theyre trying to prevent griefers
[6:16:49] xaaaaa: and after the duel cds are reseted Pog
[6:16:50] mcdeathz: they did this for tournaments
[6:16:54] jhk97: @Bendetto398 no LoS in duels brother
[6:16:55] st0neh: Just make it a big instance if they have to
[6:17:00] timeoutandy: LUL
[6:17:02] rainmannxz: hardcore griefing LUL
[6:17:11] Jumpka: no layer and just implement other people disappearing when duel starts, pserver had it for 15 years
[6:17:17] Huey710: make them instanced have a public one then a private one you invite your raid to or something
[6:17:17] Jarkeler: 500 people dueling at once xD
[6:17:18] WaterBoxx: @Ziqoftw hey bro, which addon would you recommend for spell procs like Pyro pls?
[6:17:25] Stars69: have rooms instead of layers
[6:17:26] happyheals: make war game id endtry
[6:17:26] Huey710: then you can have one for tourneys
[6:17:35] happyheals: entry
[6:17:38] timeoutandy: gonna lag a shit ton for a month  without layers then deadge with layers after 2 weeks
[6:17:39] mcdeathz: This should be no layers/ pvp force disabled for all
[6:17:42] vbx93: imagine pservers had duel spots and rdy checks in arena since 10 years
[6:17:55] Sleepylol93: Bro im so tired, i thought i was on asmon stream reacting to ziqo LUL LUL

[6:20:27] Fuwahta: Aware
[6:20:30] Stoupt14: off tank
[6:20:35] st0neh: @jhk97 Things that tell you people are buying gold Kappa
[6:20:42] Stoupt14: you can
[6:20:43] Xspazz: remeber ziqo doig mtic raid carr for pvp items KEKZ
[6:20:43] hotmanpop: @Ziqoftw ah, im braindead
[6:20:46] dinasourdickslam: guild resources buy a generator
[6:20:46] happyheals: threaten to sell his feet pics unless he gets back on

[6:21:21] bassiemon123: Its a gkick
[6:21:22] jhk97: some people also cant raid in guilds because they dont have time the same day every week
[6:21:23] bassiemon123: LUL
[6:21:24] hotmanpop: @Ziqoftw i was talking about the tank/healer selling runs lol
[6:21:25] Keljukettu: you do it tomorrow
[6:21:26] mcdeathz: UNLUCKY GO AGANE
[6:21:31] mealtiime: the easiest gkick in history
[6:21:31] happyheals: offer an ai character to fill a spot
[6:21:34] crumb321: -dkp
[6:21:35] Dunderkat: that's happened to me before it's not that unreasonable
[6:21:37] st0neh: Now you offer @Ziqoftw gold to tank for you with his pet
[6:21:40] kmeyer70: someones pc takes a shit
[6:21:59] Fuwahta: Ask chatgpt to tank
[6:21:59] Stoupt14: I dont see how classic can be enjoyable without a guild.
[6:22:08] hotmanpop: yeah that would be the best
[6:22:13] rexdojo: Can dps get tanks wife?
[6:22:18] mcdeathz: the point of classic is not to pug everything and play with different people every day though, why should they fix that
[6:22:24] malledoge420: word ziqo as always
[6:22:26] slippery87: poggering in the lair
[6:22:30] happyheals: I see why people gatekeep in trade now
[6:22:35] happyheals: jk
[6:22:35] timeoutandy: not me :)
[6:23:01] jhk97: @mcdeathz wait what do you mean with that?
[6:23:12] happyheals: Isn't Ficus a plant?
[6:23:26] Elensar748: tbh a 10man raid with a 3 day lockout doesn’t really need this, the 20mans to come which I assume will be 7day might
[6:23:51] st0neh: @Elensar748 This whole thing is blown out of proportion lol
[6:24:01] Difcar: I don't see many downsides to having a boss lockout tbh
[6:24:13] bassiemon123: If they make 20m 7 day lockout ppl will run out of shit to do
[6:24:26] bassiemon123: Unless there will be a change next phase
[6:24:30] organicmolecules: because that's how it was in classic...
[6:24:32] st0neh: That's the system because that's how it was originally @Ziqoftw
[6:24:37] st0neh: Never forget the NO CHANGE people
[6:24:40] jhk97: @organicmolecules thats not a reason to keep it tho
[6:24:41] belyiste: its sod
[6:24:42] happyheals: make the raids repeatable if you buy in game tokens to refresh your lockout
[6:24:44] belyiste: bit era
[6:24:48] belyiste: not*
[6:24:51] Dunderkat: xdd
[6:24:53] i_am_phil: also means that leavers cant get loot anymore this id
[6:24:58] Jzone: forces people not give up to early and group hopping every wipe
[6:24:58] Upsidedownsmiling: yes :)
[6:24:58] the_jot: KEKZ
[6:24:59] ryu_mmo: OFC :)

[6:25:06] mealtiime: i had mage healing me once with bandages
[6:25:21] organicmolecules: yea it should def be changed, but it's the way it is now because tha'ts how it was in classic -- prefer the retail lockout scheme
[6:25:24] pepessias: its been 84 years...
[6:25:26] st0neh: Yeah but people expected those rune changes, there are still people who shit a brick at even the suggestion of a quality of life change lol
[6:25:26] Vassah: too many no change Andy’s to accept anything new
[6:25:35] NETRAV3R: DUEL HYDRA
[6:25:38] Difcar: I think raid IDs do incentivize joining a guild so you have a consistent reliable group. Still in favor of option 2 though
[6:25:40] st0neh: There were people mad at 45m buffs KEKW
[6:25:49] hiro25000: I did tank in classic with my lock! Tanked magmadar in SL for fun (I was full t3)
[6:25:50] jhk97: @st0neh those people can play classic era xd
[6:25:55] st0neh: Not saying Blizzard should listen to them though LOL
[6:25:58] mealtiime: some people are maldign about the 100% xp buff KEKZ
[6:25:58] st0neh: Just that they exist
[6:26:05] bassiemon123: I mean mb they like shitting bricks
[6:26:05] muhfin: ya people tripping
[6:26:06] jhk97: SoD is literally about change lmao
[6:26:06] djimbob_: asmon looks younger now than 2004 :D
[6:26:07] happyheals: make a bladestorm rune and give it raid healing like divine storm
[6:26:12] muhfin: ask for classic plus then hate changes XD
[6:26:16] st0neh: I very much agree with quality of life changes like this
[6:26:17] daigurren2: 100% want. Its sick.
[6:26:21] Huey710: I do but I think sod isn't a good classic+
[6:26:31] hiro25000: Yes sir! And it worked
[6:26:35] sydale: Classic+ means different thing for everyone
[6:26:38] hiro25000: Searing pain
[6:26:42] Difcar: People want classic+ but they don't agree on what the + is
[6:26:44] Huey710: @sydale true
[6:26:45] Swayvuh: we need retail group board not this spamming in lfg shit
[6:26:45] Upsidedownsmiling: i tanked twin ims as a warlock in classic :)
[6:26:52] FrankieNOR: i love the changes with sod, but they shouldnt over-do it tho
[6:26:52] jhk97: STOP ALL DPS warlock needs threat KEKW
[6:26:55] muhfin: sod is what it means for blizzard p sure lol
[6:26:59] happyheals: searing pain right?
[6:26:59] GrandmasCloset: agree
[6:27:00] patrikpetrak2: I tanked onyxia in 2020 with shadow priest
[6:27:02] Yookzlol: NODDERS
[6:27:02] Ageond: Frozen orb
[6:27:04] Dunderkat: yeah do everything and see what sticks
[6:27:11] Ronafca: it can still become classic+ if they add stuff at lvl 60, like they already hinted at, imo
[6:27:11] Difcar: Just give us an osrs like vote system
[6:27:12] optional_advice: the main advantage i see of loot lockouts is that if people do leave early (because they didnt get their gear, or whatever) finding someone to replace is easier because they dont have to risk locking themselves on something.
[6:27:17] st0neh: SoD should be a year of experimentation for Blizzard to get ideas for a real classic+
[6:27:17] Fuwahta: The radical changes will come on "end game" phase
[6:27:19] fl0rilla: they should go crazy and adapt asap if sometime is off
[6:27:24] wreckstormx: let them cook
[6:27:33] JamesIRL: do you think sod will continue for years? like old school runescape adds changes?

[7:06:39] cr1zpylol: groundibg had shieldwall
[7:06:59] zi0qt: Grounding is hella bad. it laggs sometimes and doesnt "protect" the caster so it doenst  absorb the cast. i've tried this multiple times on my shaman
[7:07:01] luzid7: its 100% bugged its more as gcd
[7:07:01] zi0qt: hella annoying
[7:07:09] kreeezy: Both
[7:07:11] jhk97: decoy makes them immune to all kinds of shit
[7:07:17] exequtegg: decoy is a 2nd grounding

[7:07:26] ndras: fk shamans
[7:07:29] happyheals: what did you call me?
[7:07:40] exequtegg: @Ziqoftw bro its decoy, decoy works just like grounding
[7:07:46] montylamb: no its doesnt
[7:07:50] Porneaux: decoy does not work like grounding
[7:07:55] montylamb: decoy for physical
[7:08:01] Porneaux: stop spreading misinformation. Decoy is for physical only
[7:08:28] gia__: o7
[7:08:30] happyheals: he decoyed the information
[7:08:32] montylamb: SoM > SoD tho
[7:08:33] zi0qt: if it absorbed 1st cast its weird. sometimes when i drop grounding i have to move around before it actually shows as a buff on me. kinda like how the game doesnt dismount u when u run straight inside a house
[7:08:41] ndras: oom
[7:08:55] lil__dolo: correct
[7:08:59] jhk97: +immunity to movement impairing effects ye
[7:08:59] Qeevdo: ranged attacks too
[7:09:00] OptimusPrimePleb: shaman running at you is almost as scary as a fapped warrior back in classic

[7:09:08] mtndewslurpee: ziqo im about to pull up
[7:09:38] kreeezy: Also ranged attack in decoy
[7:10:15] Nabblet: he re casted
[7:10:30] Porneaux: @Nabblet nah, he legit just casted it
[7:10:37] hotmanpop: 442 on the shaman fireball no?
[7:10:38] happyheals: the sheep is a decoy
[7:10:42] Nabblet: oh ye my b
[7:10:44] TheVaroon: looks like batching indeed
[7:10:45] lambsaucewtf: no you didnt fireblast the groudning
[7:10:47] happyheals: 5000 iq
[7:10:48] hotmanpop: oh yeah wtf
[7:10:49] lambsaucewtf: you fireblasted him
[7:10:57] Momotormat: fireblast went into him
[7:11:07] St0nedCan00k: LUL
[7:11:10] jhk97: isnt the 324 fireblast hit?
[7:11:23] Genghish: Grounding totem now has 1k hp (fake news)
[7:11:27] Breakkyy: a damage number wont show if it hits grounding right? the 324 fireblast has to be him
[7:11:35] lambsaucewtf: if you fireblasted him it wouldnt show 324 it would of said immune
[7:11:36] Nabblet: ye u fire blasted him
[7:11:37] Captain_Hindsightx: do 0.25 playback
[7:11:40] lambsaucewtf: i doesnt show the dmg value
[7:11:42] lambsaucewtf: it*
[7:11:44] JUMJUMnoMi: combat log in game still there ?? you can double check ?
[7:11:44] danparsonss: totem comes out mid fireball i think
[7:11:44] tr0bs: living flame hitting for 300 tick?
[7:11:46] lambsaucewtf: if it gets grounded
[7:11:46] ieatzpie055: You did fireblast him because fireblast only did 550 to the totem ( which i assume was a crit on the totem )
[7:11:48] st0neh: Probably a delaye before his totem absorbed
[7:11:58] zi0qt: what im talking about aswell - lag makes it so grounding sometimes doesnt apply on you for ever
[7:12:01] zi0qt: @Ziqoftw
[7:12:01] cryshardcore: there is a grounding next to you next
[7:12:02] danparsonss: is it like a cloak thing in wrath? if its in the air it will go thru
[7:12:06] luzid7: its 100% bugged shamans are so broken in bgs you can't hit them and they are immun to spells from other player in this time aswell
[7:12:08] hotmanpop: living bomb does no dmg maybe?
[7:12:12] TheVaroon: only direct damage destroy it, dots just remove it for 10 sec ish
[7:12:13] lazeeqt94: he moved totems at the same time, kept the grounding alive!!
[7:12:30] jram_tv: if anything the totem came out late
[7:12:36] lazeeqt94: no, he moves totems when you bombed it
[7:12:38] instajke: test it!
[7:12:39] jram_tv: after the initial
[7:12:41] tr0bs: naah that looked sus
[7:12:45] zi0qt: As i said grounding lags and doesnt apply on you sometimes. it never protected him before ur scorch. u only went through that 1 grounding. grounding is just lagging and bad
[7:12:47] loppeo: looked like him moving the grounding "refreshed" it?
[7:13:05] SippinSimpSyrup: Grounding has always been buggy as fuck
[7:13:15] pdeevsxyz: go nexttttttt
[7:13:17] jhk97: its like a wl dot or smth, he doesnt get debuff but totem doesnt die cuz application doesnt do damage,
[7:13:24] Breakkyy: it normal kills it for me as a shaman...I ahve a WA that tells me what got grounded...I eat Living bombs all thet ime and it goes away
[7:13:24] jhk97: i think so anyways
[7:13:29] luzid7: you  mean 3 globas xd
[7:13:35] Breakkyy: that guy had grounding on steroids lmao

[7:17:24] luzid7: wait did the sham get dmg from the explosion?
[7:17:32] papismaekmyazz: deathNOTED
[7:17:44] jallaballan: Bomb explosion counts as its own spell, it knocks back casting and doesnt work If its out of range
[7:17:44] hiro25000: have you ever duel a decent warlock?
[7:17:57] hotmanpop: it's as if the explosion itself counts as an harmful spell LUL
[7:18:01] mistahfrank: so should we living bomb when grounding is up or no?
[7:18:12] Breakkyy: my WA tells me I eat living flames as well when clearly its on the ground killing me lmao
[7:18:36] eeExcelerate: makes sense, it procs hot streaks

[7:44:17] happyheals: 5g and afk in cities
[7:44:23] gambleragain: I understand that. But you're not looking into why that is a thing. Last 2 bosses have proven to be hard for pugs.
[7:44:25] st0neh: Not gonna lie though I join those groups then don't use a single consumable KEKW
[7:44:27] luzid7: the problem are player that leavs the grp after one wipe and not new player or player that don't do much dmg
[7:44:29] hashg0dx: if its a parse group id understand to have full wbs/consumes
[7:44:32] zillazay137: not a problem, I don’t want to carry people and take 3 hour on a raid
[7:44:33] jhk97: people required 6/6 xp week one
[7:44:33] cowboysfromhell55: those raid leader thinks its harder than mythic plus...
[7:44:36] tonyporker03: the raid isnt hard enough for the need of that
[7:44:42] tr0bs: Preach for the rejects Z
[7:44:42] quill_tdtv: because the sod population is roleplaying like this is hard content, if you want to ask for logs go play fucking retail
[7:44:42] eberstal: The consums and WBs part isnt bad
[7:44:45] Nahatip: ur the wrong class obv, as priest i get offered gold for joining the same grps kekw

[7:45:37] st0neh: @jhk97 It isn't though, they can still find/form another group
[7:45:39] kreeezy: Wow has changed with the meta slaves dont want to progress
[7:45:42] makewowgreatagane: raid is a joke why people even care
[7:45:43] hashg0dx: what are you talking about 1-2 ppl max
[7:45:44] Lvl100Magikerp: Why would anyone invite a gray log guy over someone who cleared it though? Why take the worse player and gimp 9 others time?
[7:45:45] hashg0dx: LMFAO
[7:45:45] gambleragain: @jhk97 That's not gatekeeping. That's wanting a standard for your raid.
[7:45:47] mealtiime: @quill_tdtv fuck the last boss in atal dazar, always depleted my keys there
[7:45:57] ParfumAmerican: the gigachad plan - make SOD  so good that they actually make retail with the same philosophy
[7:46:01] hashg0dx: @grubols if everyone have wb's you can parse in a pug what are you on about kid
[7:46:04] quill_tdtv: 22+ AD, you're the healer, imagine @mealtiime KEKZ
[7:46:10] Lvl100Magikerp: If every raid has it, how did people clear it then?

[7:46:51] Lvl100Magikerp: "every group is like that"
[7:46:54] alucardm5: True
[7:47:00] happyheals: Just type "Ziqo Weekly Speed Run"
[7:47:03] gambleragain: Look into why that exists tho. Cause the last 2 bosses are hard.
[7:47:07] Jzone: @Lvl100Magikerp u are just to stupid to understand
[7:47:20] quill_tdtv: yeah i love both versions of WoW, i just hate gatekeeping its so stupid, especially when sod players are generally just badddd
[7:47:21] tr0bs: LMFAO

[7:51:42] lateloll: @gambleragain if you cant get glad, its because you arent good enough, if you cant get into gnomer, its because classic andys are idiots.
[7:51:46] el_savic: We had a guy attack our guild becasue the average logs in our guild were 60s and in his was 90s so he harrased our guild leader for trying to recruit to the guild @Ziqoftw

[7:54:34] st0neh: My logs are solid enough to not deny me groups, after that I couldn't care less
[7:54:42] Jzone: can u duel a lock
[7:54:51] mistahfrank: "yo bro i pressed this ability in a 20 year old game better than you"
[7:55:05] Qemist: logs are just an evolution of the cancer that started with GearScore 15 years ago
[7:55:19] Lvl100Magikerp: @mistahfrank Yeah because pvp isn't that right
[7:55:27] hotmanpop: i will always take greater pride in destroying another player in pvp rather than killing the same NPC (which is meant to be beaten)

[7:55:32] lazeeqt94: you were a bully dont lie ahaha

[7:55:54] gambleragain: It's not about looking down on people. It's about holding a standard for the raid you want to make. Anyone else is just a bad person.
[7:55:57] mtndewslurpee: your should log your pvp flag on
