[1:02:45] snux_1: Cdew isn't so great? Are you kidding me? When was the last time you saw a player with such an ability and movement with a healer? Cdew puts the game in another level, and we will be blessed if we ever see a player with his skill and passion for the game again. Tempo breaks records. Cdew breaks the rules. You can keep your statistics. I prefer the magic.

As I got older, like a kid discovering that Santa is not real, WoW gradually lost its appeal to me. Its still awesome, just not as awesome as Christmas when you still believe in Santa.
