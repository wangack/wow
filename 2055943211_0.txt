[0:10:52] Ryok: if it would've been like 20 or more tokens per 10k i would've done it... but 10 is too little
[0:10:57] Ujai321: listen, we wont know until next year
[0:10:58] Zuldak: the new dailies are fun but they took out the bonecharm bracelet so you cant power farm the love tokens
[0:10:59] tempestmellinger1901: hazelWave
[0:11:02] jack_fraust: If I am a shade shy of 50 and ditching school today for you and wow, is that such a bad thing?????

[0:15:58] Ryok: first of the day*
[0:16:06] wolfcloudchaser80: @Ryok I think they may have added the "dismount aura" to the quest NPCs recently, because yeah, it was a mess earlier.
[0:16:09] Vazeelthun: Kappa
[0:16:16] Fernmaster_187: Ty :)
[0:16:30] cashthb: wait, wtf is this pay-2-win golden Kappe, I'm outraged!

[0:18:35] Fernmaster_187: unless I'm missing some dailies I don't know about
[0:18:44] cashthb: the intro quest is 150 by itself
[0:19:04] Kretyn: @Ujai321 Math*, but yes :)

[0:20:41] Ujai321: "the big dig" is what i call my love r... nevermind
[0:20:53] Vazeelthun: I would love if they'd give dragonflying to the old engineering mounts
[0:20:55] cashthb: how would it swoop up?
[0:20:59] Fernmaster_187: omg
[0:21:02] Fernmaster_187: bennnySparkle
[0:21:04] jeffdmk: The way the numbers worked for me is that you need an alt doing dailies for each mount you want and then doing the intro for each other expensive thing you need
[0:21:06] Fernmaster_187: yesss
[0:21:06] Terra___l: how i understand it  that all flying will then dynamic flying
[0:21:15] TotallyNotRaien: i just got the rares for zereth mortis flying finally
[0:21:31] anker_jym: Well, I had to delete Hearthstone temporarily because my phone is too old and overheats, so that's lame

[0:22:38] Fernmaster_187: hikes are nice
[0:22:41] mirandaplaysgamesss: i dont think the love tokens are account bound
[0:22:42] Ujai321: have you played any Persona at all?
[0:23:04] wolfcloudchaser80: I mooched as well.
[0:23:13] anker_jym: @jeffdmk I usually make it to low Diamond every month, so I think so?

[0:25:41] NordicSorcerer: @foss1lstreams Actually, Chocolate should never be exposed to temperatures lower than 8 degrees C (it ruins one of the taste chemicals of the cocoa)...
[0:25:48] NordicSorcerer: Hi, @HazelNuttyGames :)
[0:25:49] heldtheline: I still remember that Pandaria intro quest where the frost mage is on first aid duty, chilling the dude's head.
[0:25:53] Ujai321: @saga_no technically she has 5, but has so far only revealed 4
[0:25:58] Terra___l: is that the undead set?
[0:26:29] foss1lstreams: @NordicSorcerer I hate to admit... even the worst of chocolate tastes good to me lol
[0:26:31] cashthb: chocolate chillers are a pillar of society, so you better cool it with that sarcastic tone Young Lady
[0:26:33] anker_jym: @heldtheline And people say Pandaria was a kiddie expansion lol
[0:26:39] Ujai321: i cant believe how unlucky you got with all these loaded dice, true
[0:26:43] NordicSorcerer: brb, I have something real important to take care of.
[0:26:58] foss1lstreams: @JustIAron Undead heritage + S2 priest tier I think

[0:30:49] TotallyNotRaien: all the boys just modifying their paper planes
[0:30:56] GreenArrowed: one of my moms work friends used to make me really intricate fun paper planes every time i came to the office
[0:31:03] GreenArrowed: he was my fave work uncle
[0:31:27] witchhobbit: what were those paper folding things that we wrote inside each tab? that is all i did
[0:31:47] cashthb: we never had those, I think my school was too concerned about the losers being smoked
[0:32:08] GreenArrowed: @haleych fortune tellers
[0:32:15] heldtheline: I remember those fortune tellers, and playing MASH, to see who we were going to marry and how many kids we'd have.
[0:32:28] GreenArrowed: mash!
[0:32:32] witchhobbit: @GreenArrowed oh LUL
[0:32:56] GreenArrowed: ready for a time machine so i can go back to not having sponsibilities
[0:33:04] Zuldak: i remember people who were good at folding would actually sell the fortune tellers for like a quarter
[0:33:07] witchhobbit: i thought they were called something else for some reason lol
[0:33:10] saga_no: Oh those things.... *core memory unlocked*
[0:33:16] Taukken03: excited for priest Hero Talents?
[0:33:32] saga_no: People at my school only used them to bully other kids...
[0:34:45] IAmScarlett__: hey
[0:34:47] IAmScarlett__: hey hazel hello
[0:35:17] cashthb: I usually rocked the good old "you'll get punched/kicked in the [organ]",
[0:35:19] IAmScarlett__: im ok,,,ish
[0:35:21] cashthb: slept:
[0:35:23] IAmScarlett__: i did 3 18s yesterday

[0:36:26] Kuestar: nice
[0:36:34] saga_no: Wait - the OG Mean Girls?
[0:36:40] cashthb: does that caount?
[0:36:45] jeffdmk: you should at least get 6k because it is the last floor and that makes it kinda fun
[0:36:47] saga_no: Or have they done a remake...?
[0:37:10] IAmScarlett__: it ran during the pandemic
[0:37:17] Zuldak: So the movie based on a play based on a movie
[0:37:18] saga_no: Very meta
[0:37:27] heldtheline: So... Mean Girls: The Musical: The Movie
[0:37:39] lauramilano09: Renee rapp who played Regina was soo good
[0:37:59] Zuldak: isnt mean girls 20 years old?
[0:37:59] Ujai321: glad you watched and enjoyed it :)
[0:38:04] saga_no: I didn't know they made a musical
[0:38:13] IAmScarlett__: i feel so astronomically bored of gearing in s3
[0:38:19] IAmScarlett__: is it worth just waiting till s4
[0:38:23] Ujai321: @Zuldak it is
[0:38:23] saga_no: But I also still think the OG movie came out "like three years ago"
[0:38:58] cashthb: I don't get it, how did enjoy a musical that didn't have Gosling in it?
[0:39:02] Ujai321: but does it replace REPO! as your favorite? probably not, but i have to ask
[0:39:15] MackPlays: The mean girls are mean women now
[0:39:16] IAmScarlett__: im ilvl 453 its ok
[0:39:30] Ujai321: 'smite do'

[0:39:48] goplacidly56: Crazy noone is there
[0:39:49] Algfader: looks like it's jabbing with it's heads
[0:40:20] saga_no: Ooh riight.. that's now.. heh. Good thing I got the mount last year
[0:40:34] Zuldak: right now the collecting community is running alts through the love rocket try
[0:40:37] saga_no: I still haven't logged into WoW after my unplanned hiatus
[0:40:39] anker_jym: I think Blizz said they were trying to make these events soloable moving forward. Pretty sure Superbloom can be soloed too, but can't confirm
[0:41:34] Ujai321: oh no, not out of you coaffee
[0:41:43] jeffdmk: if you dont buy a socket those sell for good gold at the end of the season normally
[0:41:52] Jack_the_Dipper: kaatCat
[0:42:12] anker_jym: Being an enchanter is nice for Vault, because if you don't have any good options, you can at least pick something to DE
[0:42:13] wolfcloudchaser80: Did you find any dallasite on your hike?
[0:42:38] IAmScarlett__: are we doing more class hall stuffies
[0:42:52] Zuldak: it isnt too late to become a rock nerd
[0:42:52] saga_no: Hazel entering her crystals era? I'm here for it.
[0:42:58] wolfcloudchaser80: Become a rock nerd now! It's fun!
[0:42:59] jeffdmk: That would have rocked you could say
[0:43:08] alisoninaisle10: i have done none of the events recently
[0:43:10] kynlaeh: my best friend is a rock nerd getting her PhD in geology
[0:43:13] alisoninaisle10: and found out i missed the outland cup
[0:43:14] Ujai321: i would have put money on your word nerd brain saying "geologist" instead of "rock nerd"
[0:43:15] alisoninaisle10: grrrr
[0:43:41] anker_jym: I think it depends on what the market for the Resonant Crystal is like at the time. I honestly don't pay much attention to the pity tokens, so I'm not surem
[0:43:59] thetruedadgamer: I’ve heard of rock hounds but a rock squirrel 😉
[0:44:07] Ujai321: i would have lost my money, even without the loaded dice
[0:44:21] wolfcloudchaser80: Geologists are the professionals. Rockhounds are just ordinary people that like pretty rocks and go looking for them.
[0:44:37] Algfader: Speaking of rock.. it's chris rock's birthday
[0:44:39] anker_jym: No, you're totally fine! It's good info to have if you're in to gold farming
[0:44:41] Zuldak: Oh! if you have dragon isle resources you have nothing to do with, go to the niffen and buy barter boulders and vendor em. 25 gold for 100 resources
[0:44:58] IAmScarlett__: ive been  so tempted to buy 100 pounds worth of wow tokens.
[0:45:15] MackPlays: How many vaults for a wow token hmm
[0:45:20] anker_jym: Yeah, that's a fair point. Guess I know what I'm doing from now on lol
[0:45:34] wolfcloudchaser80: Some rocks are very local-specific. Petrosky stones are limited to the Great Lakes area, and Dallasite is local to Vancouver Island.
[0:45:49] saga_no: I only take stuff off the vault to DE *if* I also need the mog (and there's no good option I actually need)
[0:45:55] cashthb: by dö wéy, you got the lunar festival saddle?
[0:46:09] sk8rbunn: gotta do the seeds, so you can get all the emerald bounty tmog
[0:46:30] Zuldak: ODIE smells for Oders
[0:46:30] MackPlays: So about 40 vaults for 120k
[0:46:43] Ujai321: ohh, there is an area on the minimap
[0:46:48] jeffdmk: This quest is odious (not really but i just had to say it)
[0:47:17] sk8rbunn: ive gotten all weps, mail and leather. 2 off of plate, and 3 cloth
[0:47:27] sk8rbunn: then to never deal with those seeds again
[0:47:59] Zuldak: im done with collecting in the ED also. There was one rare spawn mob who drops a rogue only dagger. So rude
[0:48:09] IAmScarlett__: do you think we'll still have vigor in the war within
[0:48:10] Ujai321: imagine if they take it away with 11.0
[0:48:35] JustFrogging: chefja1Hai
[0:48:44] Zuldak: speaking of dynamic flying, has anyone noticed that you randomly decelerate while flying in old world zones?
[0:49:01] Ujai321: fan tastic
[0:49:13] witchhobbit: i kinda wish the gryphon had the normal ability instead
[0:49:18] witchhobbit: or just the option
[0:49:18] anker_jym: Wait, the War Within mount has a new ability? What is it?
[0:49:19] heldtheline: Red's the colour of love and blood after all.
[0:49:26] Zuldak: it kinda does feel like a passing through phasing issue
[0:49:35] Elrathir: I figure they might make more different 3-vigor abilities for different mounts, for variety
[0:49:38] jeffdmk: @Zuldak it seems to happen to me when i enter fatigue areas or get really high up
[0:49:52] Neltalie: female orcs looks sooo cool, maybe i should make one :D
[0:49:54] Ujai321: yeah, put a giant skull on your murder sniff hound
[0:50:24] JMan31337: is the option to turn off dragon riding in?
[0:50:30] Hulkhokie: i'm working on brutus now as well
[0:50:34] Hulkhokie: 29 away
[0:51:00] sence_00: Speaking of toys, do you think we could do the achieve for True Love Prisim with you? Otherwise idk how to get 50 people co-ordinating
[0:51:00] Ujai321: nice, finally completed 25 quests
[0:51:15] JMan31337: yea the favorite button just always picks a dragon riding
[0:51:19] IAmScarlett__: i have given up hope of getting the leggo axe
[0:51:33] sk8rbunn: im just waiting for them to add more beyond 500 toys
[0:51:34] Hulkhokie: i also got the heartbreaker yesterday woo
[0:51:35] sk8rbunn: cheevo*
[0:51:40] Zuldak: @sence_00 there is an achievment discord or maybe secret finding would do it
[0:51:40] sence_00: yeah Ive been asking in the achieves disc
[0:51:59] heldtheline: Or putting up a premade in the group finder?
[0:52:03] sk8rbunn: 750 currently
[0:52:08] Zuldak: everyone who says 'i just got the heartbreaker' adds 1 grain of salt to my salt pile.
[0:52:10] grimblade81: I got 761
[0:52:11] wolfcloudchaser80: I need to find a discord for doing the hive mind mount. Never did that back in the day.
[0:52:14] Ujai321: how does reading the sentence "coordinating 50 people" feel for you?
[0:52:22] sence_00: its just that raid groups dont go up to 50 I dont think
[0:52:23] jeffdmk: 764 :)
[0:52:26] IAmScarlett__: @Zuldak i just got the heartbreaker. :)
[0:52:46] Zuldak: @IAmScarlett__ did it. I have ascended to my new form. I am now a salt elemental
[0:52:49] jeffdmk: I like when we post numbers in chat
[0:52:56] Ujai321: good thing you have already died before
[0:53:16] IAmScarlett__: @Zuldak mwahhaha
[0:53:52] Hulkhokie: @Zuldak do you drop a pet?
[0:53:56] IAmScarlett__: me
[0:53:59] R1_Prototype: The love is in the air boss that everybody keeps talking about? Are they talking about the chemical company people from shadow fang keep? or is there another?
[0:54:03] IAmScarlett__: i missed the gilneas thing
[0:54:12] IAmScarlett__: i dont like the tmog so im not doing it
[0:54:15] Zuldak: one of my alts bumped into Calia while she was in a burning  building here
[0:54:35] Zuldak: I did the quest so that it wouldnt show up and bother me
[0:54:46] Zuldak: i feel i complete most questing so that it goes away
[0:54:46] JustFrogging: toadphBoog
[0:54:49] Ujai321: probably the woolies
[0:54:54] IAmScarlett__: hey hazel did u do the gileas chain
[0:55:01] witchhobbit: i'm getting so close to finishing the nazjatar meta but idk if i can get all the rares and i may have to give up on it :(
[0:55:04] anker_jym: I play for the story, so I had to get the lore lol
[0:55:11] heldtheline: By the way, Barnaclus in that outfit in your Saturday vid looked amazing. <3
[0:55:30] witchhobbit: really wish they would consider changing the spawn timers on old rares
[0:55:38] sk8rbunn: you doing the 70k gold cheevo, Hazel?
[0:55:41] witchhobbit: easily my number one request haha
[0:55:54] lordhodgy: lordhodgy subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 9 months! 
[0:55:54] Streamlabs: lordhodgy just subscribed with Twitch Prime!
[0:56:05] sk8rbunn: its 10 points, and I want 40k
[0:56:11] jeffdmk: @haleych just make alts on every rp server
[0:56:15] Ujai321: but achievement points are forever
[0:56:20] sk8rbunn: oh, I absolutely am a sucker
[0:56:20] Zuldak: well everyone is saying its stupid which is a good reason to do it: spite em
[0:56:22] grimblade81: <--- sucker
[0:56:26] lordhodgy: So excited! I got midnight after 2 attempts and the hellfire core in 30 attempts, all within 24 hours!
[0:56:37] sence_00: yah I would love to hit 40k points lol
[0:56:45] WhippWhapp: I just gold capped one toon, working on 2nd now! ;)
[0:56:45] JMan31337: it temporarily disables the gold cap warning
[0:56:46] helheimr: @Ujai321 unless they remove it and make it a FoS
[0:56:48] GreenArrowed: spite is personal
[0:56:53] witchhobbit: @jeffdmk true, this could be the way to go when everything is acc wide especially
[0:56:53] Zuldak: oh hey you met calia too
[0:57:35] Ujai321: so if i said "i bet you only dont do it because you cannot afford it", you could do it to spite me, if you let it get to you enough?
[0:57:46] JustFrogging: toadphBoog
[0:58:06] Ujai321: if kira got bored of you, you would know. i'm certain
[0:58:08] ceebz76: They never get tired of affection.
[0:58:20] jeffdmk: @haleych I should not recommend people do that because there will be more competition on some of my servers
[0:58:24] lordhodgy: @whippwhapp what method did you use? I'm struggling in the gold department
[0:58:30] anker_jym: I love how active Kira's been in streams lately
[0:58:44] Ujai321: i have been playing that game ever since at least TLDR, if not longer
[0:58:49] witchhobbit: @jeffdmk LUL
[0:58:55] jeffdmk: There is no cancel hazel would waste gold on that achievment
[0:58:59] Ujai321: but i have to pick the battles carefully, and this doesnt seem worth i
[0:59:08] Zuldak: The NPC doesnt queue you, it just opens the box
[0:59:16] wolfcloudchaser80: "Whatever happened to socilization?" said.... Hazel?!
[0:59:16] Ujai321: or you will never play subnautica
[0:59:53] sk8rbunn: I play WW, griefing healers is what I do
[0:59:56] Zuldak: im just here for the background noise and chatting
[0:59:57] anker_jym: New challenge, queue for the boss as a Shadow Priest healer lol
[1:00:00] WhippWhapp: @lordhodgy Emerald Dream BOE farm has given me about 15 million
[1:00:05] Ujai321: that would have been my guess btw, when you told us about Mean Girls, but i was afk
[1:00:16] MrSonicgen: Heading out. Have a great day.
[1:00:23] lordhodgy: @whippwhapp well hot dang
[1:00:25] Zuldak: on all my characters i queue for all roles. It doesnt matter
[1:00:30] anker_jym: On a holiday boss, it's probably easy lol
[1:00:35] zamyrha_: you can stay in shadow spec for sure.. it's the same everything dies too fast to need heals.
[1:00:39] WhippWhapp: @lordhodgy Xfer the BOE's across multiple realms
[1:00:41] sk8rbunn: oh its so giga easy
[1:00:42] Timetaco: If you could pick only one class to play for the rest of the expansion what would you choose?
[1:00:46] zamyrha_: just hit vampiric embrace and blast
[1:00:52] jeffdmk: yeah que any role and dps on this one
[1:01:13] anker_jym: Especially since they introduced Headless Horseman hard mode last year
[1:01:13] Zuldak: what was the old spriest talent that killed you eventually? Surrender to madness?
[1:01:21] WhippWhapp: @lordhodgy I multibox 8 accounts however, but I see ppl in 2x4 farms often
[1:01:28] witchhobbit: i accidently queued as healer thinking i was in my healing spec but i was in shadow and i was like nooooo NotLikeThis i'm not this person pls
[1:01:31] sk8rbunn: pretty sure most 480+ melee could just solo this fight
[1:01:34] anker_jym: @zuldak Yes, and I always took it for fun factor lol
[1:02:05] Zuldak: yeah that talent is why i never learned spriest. I kept trying to follow the spriest guide and kept failing and dying
[1:02:16] anker_jym: That talent was so much fun lol
[1:02:16] sk8rbunn: who was it that would always hit you with the "hazel prepot" on break timers?
[1:02:21] jeffdmk: surrender was so much fun the skill cap was crazy high
[1:02:40] Rugmanimus: Yeah the boss for the Time Rift won't spawn boss unitl 9 mins in
[1:02:53] Zuldak: confession time.... i never ever use pots. Im cheap
[1:03:42] WhippWhapp: I am buying a 360mm liquid cooler for my new 13900K, my trusty Noctua air cooler has finally met it's match :(
[1:04:23] furiforever: When im healing raid I take 40 of the pots from the cauldron and never use them. Just keep them to give out to others who need. I can't pot power potions, i need MANA lol
[1:04:26] Owlds: Heya
[1:04:30] Jammiy: I got my pink rocket yesterday! it only took 14 years :D
[1:04:48] Jammiy: it really is
[1:04:56] Owlds: @furiforever You can't trade conjured items though raxxThink
[1:05:26] Timetaco: How often do you clean your keyboard?
[1:05:32] furiforever: I do it every week....
[1:05:36] jamie_lee: Lucky! if I get it it will be 15 years for me. Cross your fingers and your toes!
[1:05:41] furiforever: Even to people that were not there for the cauldron
[1:05:44] witchhobbit: LUL
[1:05:45] Timetaco: Nasty lol
[1:05:49] Tallgeese12: Mood
[1:05:56] sk8rbunn: 0 is a number Kappa
[1:05:56] Tallgeese12: LUL
[1:05:57] Owlds: @HazelNuttyGames  so I have every class at max level is it unreasonable for me to want them all at 460+ ilvl?
[1:05:59] WhippWhapp: @Timetaco once/week. I actually have 2 of the exact same k/b and mouse, just swap for easier cleaning
[1:06:02] solkana: More than zero times.
[1:06:05] wolfcloudchaser80: I got one of those electric powered air blaster things. It hurricanes my computer right out.
[1:06:26] GreenArrowed: i got a new low profile mechanical keyboard that's so so much easier to clean that my old keyboard
[1:06:30] GreenArrowed: and i still don't clean it regularly
[1:06:36] jeffdmk: It does not effect your life until it starts to smell
[1:06:39] Zuldak: just dander :/
[1:06:50] Tallgeese12: Wait when your keyboard gets dirty yall just don't just buy new one? havercSmile
[1:07:03] jeffdmk: @Owlds that is not that bad
[1:07:16] Owlds: I mean, I "work" from home and find myself with a lot of free time lol.
[1:07:35] Zuldak: get a leaf blower
[1:07:58] WhippWhapp: Dyson blind attachment is great for cleaning mech k/b's
[1:07:59] OlsargeTV: I play without keys 5Head
[1:08:00] elliongrey: Hmm. Vault choices. Legs for tier set transmog or hero track weapon...
[1:08:34] elliongrey: RIght? That's true
[1:08:45] Perkolate: transmog is temporary, being on top of the meters is forever.
[1:09:02] dt_tex: has there been an announcement on when s4 will be? I am ready to move on. Pugs in keys are really bad right now
[1:09:04] Zuldak: meters rest tho
[1:09:26] 7thSaga: got my first cup of coffee and time to start the day with a Hazel stream :)
[1:09:36] sk8rbunn: pretty sure I still have a SS of my 100 frost DK parse from antorus
[1:09:55] saga_no: Not me screenshotting myself at the top of the damage meters or whenever I do good numbers and posting them in my guild's discord.... LUL
[1:09:58] Perkolate: you make 2 separate meter windows, make the 2nd one only you and put that ontop of the first one
[1:09:59] Jadesoulbird: Hiya Hazel
[1:10:05] 7thSaga: Hazel uses the jedi mind trick hand movement ''theres this game called world of warcraft'' LUL
[1:10:10] anker_jym: @hazelnuttygames they have just released the next batch of Hero Talent previews
[1:10:13] saga_no: Like "LOOK GUYS - I *can* do good...."
[1:10:21] dt_tex: they made ksm a little too easy this time...people were done really early this season
[1:10:43] 7thSaga: @dt_tex same was way to easy lol
[1:11:10] Zuldak: the reason is because of lazy. The pieces drop from different time rift bosses and the bags corrrispond to loot tables
[1:11:19] Zuldak: blizz didnt want to mess with combining tables into one bag
[1:11:26] Mattyboh: @HazelNuttyGames I have almost 300 aspect crests im not gonna use on my main. Is there anything i can do with them
[1:12:28] Mattyboh: There has to be something. CHAT HELP!
[1:12:36] goochyboi: can i pet that dawggggg
[1:12:39] BreninUK: u can buy teh nascent tokens then sell them for a bit of gold
[1:12:42] Mattyboh: wish i could send them to my alt
[1:12:45] Zuldak: you can wait till end of the season when they are converted to gold
[1:13:11] Zuldak: oh gosh this quest...
[1:13:19] Zuldak: this quest is... i hope the dev who made this is ok
[1:13:29] Zuldak: the org stress quest
[1:13:54] cashthb: just a by a bunch of chocolate! I love chocolate
[1:14:37] stickgamingy: I’m trying for the mounts and pets . gotta catch them all!!
[1:16:00] Zuldak: the 2x 270 prizes are the big ones
[1:16:20] sk8rbunn: I knocked out everything but the 2 big ones day one, and have been farming boat and mount on monks
[1:17:04] spoilt_bat: hi hazel, having a bad brain day but wanted to stop by since i don't usually have the chance to catch you live
[1:17:14] 7thSaga: LUL
[1:17:18] 7thSaga: Hazel LUL
[1:17:30] Kretyn: @spoilt_bat Wishing you the best <3
[1:17:47] Zuldak: i saw a rumor that the pirate day thing is related to gallywix and is the dev's way of giving Kotick a sendoff... funny speculation lol
[1:17:58] SuperSugar: First time seeing you LIVE as well.  I love your Saturday News Catch-up on YouTube
[1:18:07] jeffdmk: how do you feel about supporting small independent artisans? (in game)
[1:18:07] SuperSugar: SuperSugar subscribed with Prime. 
[1:18:08] Streamlabs: supersugar just subscribed with Twitch Prime!
[1:18:18] sk8rbunn: nothing new
[1:18:18] spoilt_bat: ty hazelCry  @Kretyn
[1:18:21] GreenArrowed: lunar festival stuff felt hidden
[1:18:23] Zuldak: 40k lunar festival mount thing
[1:18:24] lordhodgy: Wow your realm is so alive
[1:18:25] GreenArrowed: i didn't even check for new things
[1:18:27] sk8rbunn: unless you've missed past years
[1:18:30] cashthb: good thing no one asked you if you got the lunar festial saddle or not :)
[1:18:37] zamyrha_: Just dragon harness i think for 50k
[1:18:39] databob1: Dragon
[1:18:41] 7thSaga: theres quite a few diffrent mogs and not sure a mount
[1:18:43] cashthb: not 50k?
[1:18:51] Zuldak: yeah thats a vendor thing
[1:19:10] cosmicblood84: so how do you get lightblue tmog for love is in the air i guess it hidden @HazelNuttyGames
[1:19:41] cosmicblood84: im guess its hidden
[1:19:46] anker_jym: Gosh, can you imagine trying to farm 50k Lunar Festival tokens lol
[1:19:47] sk8rbunn: the light blue set that matches the trading post set?
[1:19:51] heldtheline: It's armor for the slitherdrake; I mean, it is pretty hazelWant
[1:19:53] JMan31337: 50k tokens would be insane
[1:20:03] themaykr_: themaykr_ subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 4 months, currently on a 2 month streak! 
[1:20:03] Streamlabs: themaykr_ just subscribed with Twitch Prime!
[1:20:17] zamyrha_: @cashthb it is indeed 50k for the lunar slitherdrake harness
[1:20:38] saga_no: brb
[1:21:24] supashanka: i mean it is a goblin invention soooo
[1:21:40] heldtheline: This is gnomish discrimination.
[1:21:49] Zuldak: its an improvement from eating sidewalk moss
[1:21:59] Dezzdemona417: Is there a good place to farm love tokens? Wowhead's page doesn't look like it's super updated.
[1:22:08] cashthb: it's made by the goblins, the steamwheedle neutrality is a lie, horde scum all of them
[1:22:47] cosmicblood84: wow there a love in air achievement that  takes 70K off you
[1:22:51] heldtheline: I wonder if this is to combat the botting that would happen during the old bracelet farms.
[1:23:15] Arabany: @cosmicblood84 you also get 10 tokens per day donating 10k gold:)
[1:23:17] Terra___l: @Dezzdemona417 cant farm it anymore
[1:23:35] cosmicblood84: @Arabany nope
[1:23:43] lordhodgy: Was feeling the saddies so my partner took my plant shopping and spoiled me... less sad now!
[1:23:46] cosmicblood84: my gold
[1:24:08] GreenArrowed: @lordhodgy yas plant shopping therapy
[1:24:08] 7thSaga: i just realized most of the streamers i watch have a cat or two LUL <3
[1:24:12] mianerten: do you push m+ at all? or do you just go for portals?
[1:24:28] SaraDivine: you could sell them right?
[1:24:37] anker_jym: Hazel, do you have Valentine's plans with partner?
[1:24:43] heldtheline: This is bullying.
[1:24:58] furiforever: How many tokens do you get for the intro? I only got 140 total
[1:25:09] Zuldak: you get like 140 yeah
[1:25:19] furiforever: oh ok
[1:25:27] furiforever: i was hoping for closer to that 270 lol
[1:25:28] cosmicblood84: alliance has good guards on duty
[1:25:50] Zuldak: its like 5 days of dailies ish
[1:25:50] BoogiePonderosa: hi
[1:26:00] Zuldak: whats important? Palworld
[1:26:11] Terra___l: wq ´s from archive again bugged..
[1:26:14] cosmicblood84: spam for mount isnt worth it
[1:26:19] elliongrey: DO you think the azerothian archive wolrd quest stuff is going to be the new archaeology
[1:26:25] cosmicblood84: im slowly learning
[1:26:26] Gynebra: I'm doing dailies on 3 chars since I'm missing the 2 love boat toys and the new mount peepoSad
[1:26:38] SaraDivine: i've been doing the dailies and dungeon and have 250 tokens
[1:26:54] Smartaxe: Hi @HazelNuttyGames a while ago you talked about getting a sun alarm clock, what is your opinion about it?
[1:27:04] anker_jym: Palworld mount farm streams when lol
[1:27:20] cosmicblood84: they could become spys
[1:27:25] cosmicblood84: your right
[1:27:28] Rugmanimus: Big Dig up in 1 min
[1:27:39] Gynebra: Something I realised while doing this quest is that the spies npc are usually surrounded by wrapped gifts
[1:27:52] spoilt_bat: opinions on palworld? worth it? haven't bought a new game in a while, just sticking to WoW mostly lol
[1:27:56] Gynebra: At least on horde
[1:28:31] saga_no: ....aaand back
[1:28:36] jeffdmk: you can dragon ride straight north
[1:28:44] cosmicblood84: i just pet portal
[1:28:51] Rugmanimus: Dragon Riding from there is actually pretty fast
[1:28:53] cosmicblood84: strathhome
[1:29:19] supashanka: one thing i noticed about the spies is that they'll have a golden outline on them
[1:29:44] cosmicblood84: pet portals are honestly better mythic plus portals
[1:30:02] jeffdmk: does it bother you that pal world is pretty close to being stolen ip?
[1:30:05] cosmicblood84: facts
[1:30:08] Zuldak: yeah and all the M+ portals share a cd
[1:30:12] SquiggySquonk: After you accept the quest to go to Shadowfang Keep, you should get a 3 min buff that increases your vigor regen to make the trip north quicker.
[1:30:19] wolfcloudchaser80: Both Palworld and Enshrouded are really up my alley. Love me the collecting/building games.
[1:30:49] Zuldak: ive been playing a vampire survivors like game. they are fun
[1:30:56] wolfcloudchaser80: Yup! Enshrouded is great. Higher challenge factor than Palworld, though.
[1:31:10] xLOREDONx: @HazelNuttyGames  whats your opinion on the 50k gold donation achievement ?
[1:31:14] cosmicblood84: what like a a frame
[1:31:26] cosmicblood84: hiking
[1:31:35] cashthb: btw ever considered branching out and playing a game that's not a variation of don't starve?
[1:31:42] Zuldak: the 70k donation is blizz seeing if they can ask players to just delete gold
[1:31:46] Rugmanimus: it's 70k I thought
[1:32:08] cosmicblood84: you get one that straps around you mid section
[1:32:10] Zuldak: 10k for 7 days
[1:32:16] 7thSaga: i did that donation achieve soon as i ehard about it then you get gifted Love Tokens in the mail @HazelNuttyGames
[1:32:20] supashanka: 70 is the love is in the air gold dump
[1:32:22] samxox: oracle priest seems like it will be crazy and fun
[1:32:26] supashanka: 40k is the lunar event
[1:32:32] cosmicblood84: you dont want pack moving
[1:32:38] jeffdmk: It says 70k but you get 20% progress each day so far. So something weird is happening with it
[1:32:40] 7thSaga: @supashanka for Love Tokens haha
[1:32:41] cashthb: the love is in the air achievment is 70, the lunar festival saddle 50
[1:32:48] jamien_10: Osprey brand packs with the mesh back are super comfy
[1:33:10] Rugmanimus: So it should be 20% for the first 3 days then 10% for the last 4 days
[1:33:15] Dezzdemona417: Ha! I was the same way with canning supplies :D
[1:33:18] supashanka: @7thSaga yeah thats wild
[1:34:45] cosmicblood84: im a eagle scout you know form boy scouting i did a few hikes in my day 50 mile ones in a day i will tell that pack that carry water pouch and chills it so good
[1:34:52] saga_no: That was me after every pole class ...sadly the PEM would hit a couple of days later most of the time and just wreck me completely
[1:35:02] BoogiePonderosa: usually hikes are just me watching the ground to avoid roots, sweating and bugs
[1:35:15] cosmicblood84: ive done that
[1:35:28] xLOREDONx: BONK
[1:35:30] cashthb: oh yeah, the back pack, I can recommend the osprey arcane stuff, I used the large one for a while, and it's hold up remarkably well - besides the color it faded a lot in the sun
[1:35:36] cashthb: it's pretty expensive tho
[1:36:06] Zuldak: oof some of my 60 alts are still in shadowlands >.>
[1:36:20] cosmicblood84: also thing with bugs they attack highest point on your body
[1:36:54] cosmicblood84: yep
[1:36:55] 7thSaga: LUL
[1:36:58] heldtheline: @Zuldak Put on some Evanescence and bring them back to life.

[1:38:18] cosmicblood84: you going camp and hike?
[1:38:39] fizzleblast127: They just released the hero talents for Holy/disc priest. First look at them anyway
[1:38:48] cosmicblood84: camping messes with back too
[1:38:58] GreenArrowed: i've given up on real camping and have been semi glamping the last few years
[1:39:04] lordhodgy: The lack of human-noise is lovely, but you can only go outside without being assailed by vampiric insects during late fall and winter lol
[1:39:05] anker_jym: What about glamping?
[1:39:05] cosmicblood84: just makesure if do good bed roll
[1:39:15] witchhobbit: i get stressed when the people i'm going with don't really have a plan LUL
[1:39:25] GreenArrowed: getting a tiny airstream or cabin up in the catskills with amenities and hiking or fishing is the perfect balance for me
[1:39:26] witchhobbit: can't win either way
[1:39:49] Xerseiwow: Can I ask for Hazel’s golden seal of good luck for when I ask my crush to be my Valentine today? 💘
[1:39:56] Perkolate: what if it was glamping. like having a mocktail while roastin a veggie dog on cushioned seats.
[1:40:09] cashthb: if I'd be bear I 100% would disguise myself as a camping organizer to lure people in, just sayin'
[1:40:51] lordhodgy: Hazel have you ever been to Kennedy Lake? I camped one night there and it was sooooo magical
[1:41:12] Rugmanimus: Someone killed him, he's a deer looking ad
[1:41:38] cosmicblood84: just never put air mattress down with out bed roll the air will cool inside over night and you will freeze
[1:41:38] lordhodgy: It's near Tofino 😁
[1:41:59] cosmicblood84: just a tip for camping
[1:42:30] 7thSaga: i photographed a ded elekk LUL
[1:42:38] SaraDivine: people were killing it when i did it too. not sure why
[1:42:52] 7thSaga: actually didnt know thay where walking around
[1:43:08] heldtheline: @SaraDivine because people are... well, people can be jerks.
[1:43:14] lordhodgy: Although I don't know how you guys live with tsunami warning signs everywhere - my anxiety could not do it lol
[1:43:37] jeffdmk: The photograph makes it hostile by startling it
[1:43:40] Kubwa7: elekk will automatically get scared and attack you
[1:43:43] cosmicblood84: you can get hypothermia in summer time btw form air mattress i know guy happen too
[1:43:45] Jammiy: with the elekk taking a picture made it charge me
[1:43:45] Kubwa7: you can photograph and run
[1:43:53] Kubwa7: but doubt people think that far ahead
[1:43:54] annetteswe: The Eleek attack and stomps the first person taking a pic of it
[1:43:56] cashthb: I pulled it by taking the picture, some classes have no other way of getting rid of it
[1:44:11] witchhobbit: yeah i thought people were trolling
[1:45:11] MaddiDJ4: When does this event end?
[1:45:22] jeffdmk: This quest is funny
[1:45:45] wolfcloudchaser80: Screaming into the pillows is the best.
[1:45:52] Octopixy1971: @MaddiDJ4 Mondayt 19th of februari
[1:45:59] cosmicblood84: okay strange type of love
[1:46:04] MaddiDJ4: honestly that’s why I play wow lol. life getting me down? level a new character
[1:46:09] jeffdmk: You should use the yell special action button too
[1:46:10] lordhodgy: I have an email from my estranged mother-in-law to respond to, so naturally I'm here in stream 😅
[1:46:16] Andersonmps: do /yell
[1:46:31] Octopixy1971: @lordhodgy oh no lol
[1:46:35] cashthb: i think everything that counts as an individual spell counts as 1
[1:46:47] vildusten: yesterday it was petting puppies
[1:47:18] MaddiDJ4: I know there are punching bags in the panda zone
[1:47:29] InfiniFiasco: I finally got the X-45 heartbreaker rocket today!
[1:48:11] GreenArrowed: hard mode
[1:48:19] sence_00: lmao
[1:48:23] heldtheline: Wow, that makes that solo dig kill even better.
[1:48:28] cosmicblood84: why cant things get vendor price at least 1 copper
[1:48:28] Octopixy1971: LUL
[1:48:29] sence_00: i did a raid with no trinkets last week so
[1:48:29] Jammiy: @InfiniFiasco congrats!
[1:48:31] anker_jym: Have you raised since then lol
[1:48:34] ifuse: no wonder we deplte so many keys Kappa
[1:48:35] Alannalouwho: LOL
[1:48:36] BoogiePonderosa: hazelYikes hazelYikes hazelYikes
[1:48:38] anker_jym: Raided
[1:48:52] MaddiDJ4: I need a weak aura to yell at me to put on my cloak when using the teleport cloak lol. I feel your pain
[1:48:53] cashthb: no weapon shadow mage tower next?
[1:48:55] Hippwn: Inksy likes to keep her hands free
[1:49:09] LouOfc: Not long ago i did a 22 key with the bfa cloak hahaha
[1:49:31] Octopixy1971: LUL
[1:49:34] dvkJoe: 🎶When Elune hits your eye, like a big Moonglade pie, that's amore!🎶
[1:49:48] Hulkhokie: @InfiniFiasco congrats!
[1:50:07] Andersonmps: They said you sound like a owl
[1:50:44] anker_jym: And here I thought I was an organized WoW player. You got things figured out!
[1:50:59] lordhodgy: Yeah I totally misheard big dig 🤣
[1:51:00] cosmicblood84: try with heart of azeroth
[1:51:10] cosmicblood84: much more fun
[1:51:17] Octopixy1971: @InfiniFiasco nice one gz hazelTen
[1:51:25] cosmicblood84: and 23 key
[1:52:03] saga_no: @lordhodgy You weren't the only one....
[1:52:16] Andersonmps: I did misheard that dig too LUL
[1:52:16] saga_no: ..but tbf my hearing is all over the place lately (fatigue has messed with my sensory processing)
[1:52:17] Kubwa7: @lordhodgy every...time. LUL it's gotta be hearing gamer talk for too long
[1:52:36] anker_jym: Not to try to derail you, but did you want to look at the Hero Talents, or is that something you'd rather do off stream?
[1:52:43] heldtheline: Hazel After Dark-- before noon.
[1:52:46] saga_no: *cough* After Dark *cough* LUL
[1:52:51] SaraDivine: the clues are in the same spot so if you remember where they were it goes a lot faster
[1:53:05] anker_jym: Totally fair!
[1:53:14] wolfcloudchaser80: Shhh, everyone. You'll make her self-concious and we're all just tee-heeing out of sight here.
[1:53:17] lordhodgy: I never got to see a Hazel After Dark stream :( those were a thing right?
[1:53:33] Andersonmps: Is something to be excited about too
[1:53:36] Hippwn: I sometimes forget where I write things but been using Ny's to do list addon great addon
[1:53:44] cosmicblood84: why im spamming love rocket i know blizzard hates me... love is in air ijust not riding it
[1:53:52] jeffdmk: that channel was wild
[1:53:57] witchhobbit: was that channel just for cursing? LUL
[1:54:13] Zuldak: i feel the mage tower streams were the closest to non-PG we get around here
[1:54:35] cashthb: no one ever listens to my feed back... I'v been telling the game should be more like red alert 2 for the last 15 or so years, and it's getting farther and farther
[1:55:55] Zuldak: I would be lost without my daily post-it note for what i need to do
[1:57:10] saga_no: We get good company, a well-behaved chat, and sometimes we are honored by Miss Kira and/or Mr Moose
[1:57:12] heldtheline: I can't even imagine a filthy Hazel stream. The mind boggles.
[1:57:15] MaddiDJ4: I accepted it like 5 years ago and have been happy since
[1:57:46] cosmicblood84: LOVE ROCKET IS A metaphor of for looking for love in all the wrong places and failing each time to be successful  Why must you hate me blizzard
[1:58:07] MaddiDJ4: used to watch while I packed to go visit my dad, back when they were only on Friday evenings. then would watch the Tuesday ones when I was home. now I watch at work
[1:58:10] jeffdmk: The alliance has much better guards then the horde
[1:58:11] 7thSaga: make your doggie sniff them out? LUL
[1:58:12] cashthb: the si:7 actually does it's jobs
[1:58:16] cosmicblood84: Blizzard is  trolling me
[1:58:18] saga_no: For the record - I watched *one* After Dark stream - and my jaw irl dropped when I heard Hazel say "sh*t"
[1:58:20] sence_00: they're way harder to find in SW
[1:58:26] BoogiePonderosa: I thought they always hung out in that interior garden area
[1:58:30] MaddiDJ4: blizzard trolls us all
[1:58:35] sence_00: check canals and mage quarter
[1:58:55] BoogiePonderosa: that square indoor park or whatever it is
[1:59:11] ddevillax: how r u dragonriding in azeroth? did they add that??
[1:59:25] cosmicblood84: stormwind tourist
[1:59:26] BoogiePonderosa: the revel yell
[1:59:37] heldtheline: That doesn't mean they're not a spy. Players can be tricky.
[1:59:41] sunnyauramoon: Omg this is the cutest dragon ever :o
[1:59:48] sunnyauramoon: Also hi hazel VoHiYo <3
[1:59:55] dvkJoe: @ddevillax a month or so ago.
[2:00:14] sunnyauramoon: Im fune hope you doing great :D
[2:00:17] ddevillax: i havent played since sod came out so makes sense, im hopping on right now haha
[2:00:18] sunnyauramoon: Fine*
[2:00:26] lordhodgy: On a scale of 1-10 how good is Palword at aiding in ignoring the woes of life? Lolol
[2:00:30] sunnyauramoon: Just cant type english as per usual lol
[2:00:36] 7thSaga: im not gonna lie i thought Dragon Riding was kinda lame at first but it takes some time to getting used to and now its the best thing to flying :)
[2:00:53] MaddiDJ4: what are your dragonriding settings? for some reason dragonriding in anywhere but DF zones has started to make me sick and I’m curious
[2:01:15] MaddiDJ4: @lordhodgy 10. spent 8 hours on it on Sunday instead of doing homework
[2:01:20] Hippwn: The egg incubation times are really terrible I'm thinking of changing that setting
[2:01:21] BoogiePonderosa: is palworld multiplayer?
[2:02:15] lordhodgy: @maddidj4 okay that sounds perfect lol
[2:03:16] Timetaco: Crinkle is, objectively, a cute name
[2:03:38] MaddiDJ4: my pals eat berries and only berries. they are self sufficient, make their own food then eat it
[2:03:48] lordhodgy: Random question : do you have a favourite desk cream for your hands? I need something I can put on without a major drying time
[2:04:12] witchhobbit: ooo there is a 5 love tokens mission in my bfa mission table rn!
[2:04:50] dvkJoe: Yellow bar of doom, thank god you're faster
[2:04:57] GreenArrowed: @lordhodgy i used versed gel moisturizer that's "technically" for your face, but i use it on my hands. absorbs quickly, isn't greasy, and last a long time.
[2:05:01] BoogiePonderosa: now they’re making butter out of cuticles?! MiniK
[2:05:25] lordhodgy: You might enjoy the Eucerin calming lotion is you have that problem :)
[2:05:29] cashthb: bfa still has it's table missions for all the events, include time walking!
[2:05:40] lordhodgy: @greenarrowed thank you! I'll check it out
[2:05:48] heldtheline: One of my favourite cat youtubers has cat-friendly hand cream. Dear Grey Cat.
[2:05:52] Stormcrone: I did not know that about table missions
[2:06:09] Zuldak: yes
[2:06:25] Timetaco: guards pot heads confirmed
[2:06:49] BoogiePonderosa: haha
[2:07:17] lordhodgy: I must say I love the tmog from the trading post this year - giving major sailor moon vibes
[2:08:21] Marmoh: Was love in the air always this content filled?
[2:08:35] heldtheline: Pairing the shop mog with the chibi hairstyle on a gnome would give big Chibiusa vibes.
[2:09:03] witchhobbit: @heldtheline this is the way
[2:09:08] Zuldak: you can tank in whatever spec
[2:09:35] Zuldak: LOTS of max level raiders running their charactyers through. Usually you see a 480+ slapping him
[2:09:36] heldtheline: Chibiusa was Sailor Moon's daughter; she has a whole evil arc.
[2:09:36] l_Denix_l: this is the one for sure
[2:10:21] GaryNec: Ive been trying for atleast 6+ yrs for this mount :/
[2:11:15] erwin_mulder: No mount here either, I got both bewfest mounts and the violet protodrake
[2:11:20] anker_jym: @marmoh Not until this year. They're starting to update a lot of the holidays to make them more fun to do
[2:11:22] allys79: allys79 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 40 months! 
[2:11:22] Streamlabs: allys79 just subscribed with Tier 1!
[2:11:39] witchhobbit: it was last year that they increased the drop rate for these mounts right?
[2:12:00] jeffdmk: They made the love rocket not matter
[2:12:07] avellan94: 1% ish
[2:12:32] Zuldak: Right now it's dark matter to me cause i cant see it or measure it
[2:12:41] Marmoh: I want you to know I strongly appreciated that joke hehe
[2:13:18] Zuldak: do dailies 10x each
[2:13:51] Sabrius_: just finished cleaning the whole dang house. ready to sit down with some tea and firelands runs. rng bless you hazel and chat
[2:14:06] Zuldak: you just go on an anger fueled rampage through the city 'reliving stress' for one
[2:14:33] Ujai321: Crinkle the Fury warrior?
[2:14:36] Ujai321: Pretty stressed
[2:14:50] Zuldak: they dont want a picture of a dead elephant D:
[2:14:59] heldtheline: Little ball of rage, that one.
[2:15:25] Terra___l: "Old Love is in the Air Achievements Now Feats of Strength"
[2:15:28] cashthb: if it dead, it doesn't count, museums would have put zoos out of business ages ago
[2:15:38] Ujai321: I don't think they have elephants in Mortal Kombat
[2:15:59] Zuldak: They have elephants in street fighter. Dahlsim
[2:16:19] Ujai321: Because there is a panda in Tekken, maybe
[2:16:20] Marmoh: There are pandas and bears in Tekken if that helps
[2:16:26] cashthb: you want to an elephant being fatalitied? a wwf doesn't
[2:16:26] Terra___l: Prior to the 2024 holiday refresh, you got completely smashed, put on your best perfume, threw a handful of rose petals on Jeremiah Payson, and then kissed him. You always regretted it.  lol
[2:16:41] cashthb: *want to see
[2:16:41] anker_jym: How weird would it be if Hazel started streaming fighting games?
[2:16:54] BoogiePonderosa: saw a kid for mortal Kombat swapping in Disney princesses and other characters
[2:17:01] heldtheline: One fighter in MK turns into an elephant in his animality.
[2:17:05] BoogiePonderosa: mod not kid
[2:17:08] Zuldak: I havent played street fighter since Street Fighter 2.
[2:17:24] saga_no: I dunno... I can see Hazel play something like Street Fighter II for fun. I would find it a tad more weird if Hazel suddenly started streaming CoD or something
[2:17:26] Marmoh: Fighting games are fun if you're willing to commit to learning one character
[2:17:38] Ujai321: SF6 is great, apparently. I wouldn't know, I got destroyed by a bot in sf4 and never went back
[2:17:53] BoogiePonderosa: Hazel: Warzone
[2:17:54] emarol_dk: You could play fortnite :)
[2:17:59] perrinwolf88: Nice
[2:18:03] noenken: So, Quake III Arena tomorrow? xD
[2:18:04] saga_no: Imagine Hazel as CS:GO streamer though...
[2:18:13] saga_no: O.o
[2:18:16] Hippwn: Hazel the Tarkov pro
[2:18:30] erwin_mulder: fortnite isn't so musch about shooting, but more about spamming walls and floors
[2:18:35] heldtheline: I'd watch you play CoD. I like the characters in CoD but don't have anyone I like enough to watch them play it. Price has a huge Tumblr fandom.
[2:18:48] anker_jym: I feel like it would be much harder to keep to the PG streams lol
[2:18:56] Carls93: can you change that vigor ui?
[2:18:59] saga_no: Such smol. So ANGY.
[2:19:04] Zuldak: i hope the dev who made this quest is ok
[2:19:12] cashthb: @noenken that's what I wanted to suggest, canadian ping might be though on russian servers
[2:19:48] Marmoh: That popcorn bag is half your gnome's size
[2:19:57] Marmoh: I wonder how much gnomes save on groceries
[2:20:18] BoogiePonderosa: crinkle CUTS!
[2:20:21] Zuldak: on, went to winco yesterday. Why is everything so expensive D:
[2:20:23] heldtheline: They probably make up for it in first aid fees, thanks to all that engineering.
[2:20:24] Zuldak: i do not like it
[2:20:43] saga_no: They probably do, honestly, ...smaller bodies tend to have higher heart rates (to ensure they stay warm) - and that needs fuel
[2:20:44] cashthb: you were in the right direction with the "sh-"
[2:20:48] witchhobbit: LUL
[2:20:51] Perkolate: thanks for the stream!
[2:20:52] Octopixy1971: LUL LUL
[2:20:55] cashthb: stream over, bb guys
[2:20:56] BoogiePonderosa: byyyeee
[2:21:02] BoogiePonderosa: :D
[2:21:11] Zuldak: millions of dollars? Groceries for the month
[2:21:41] janahita: Real luxury is having a cheese budget
[2:21:51] erwin_mulder: I get the pine nuts now .. they are just not 20 bucks a package
[2:21:54] cashthb: you don't want a bidet?
[2:21:56] saga_no: The same lifestyle but with the financial freedom to try that new ingredient you've been oogling at the store
[2:21:57] wolfcloudchaser80: You'd splurge on pine nuts!
[2:22:04] Marmoh: If I had millions of dollars I would be worried about not feeling existential satisfaction :p
[2:22:06] noenken: Life goal: Better cheese. I can respect that.
[2:22:35] Hippwn: If you missed a day can you still earn enought I wonder
[2:24:12] cashthb: @Hippwn enough for what, btw it's 20 a day, you look up how long the event lasts, simple division from there
[2:25:49] lordhodgy: How does getting mounts from the Shadowlands mission table work?
[2:27:23] endless_pastrami: just do 4 / 3 pvp vault slots next week to catch up on tokens for buying sockets
[2:28:12] irenecosplay: how many characters do you have to do dailies on for love tokens to be able to buy everything?
[2:28:21] SaraDivine: look up how to boost your first follower to max level. that makes it much easier and faster getting through the campaign
[2:28:21] witchhobbit: yeah i have a level 48 mission and most of my followers are less than 40. it's painful to level them lol
[2:28:24] mcxoney: did they remove lovely charm bracelets this year?
[2:28:26] Zuldak: yeah you just need strong followers to do the random mount missions. Maldraxxas and Nightfae have the best followers and troops
[2:29:21] SaraDivine: could you sell the bracelets directly too or am i misremembering
[2:29:23] Zuldak: Wasnt the turn in for the bonecharms  Saurfang for horde? Cause that's... kinda hard to do with him being dead
[2:29:49] witchhobbit: glad i unknowingly started the mission table with night fae then
[2:30:05] blueboywiz: you should try the horde side!
[2:30:08] Zuldak: nightfae are all about the troops.
[2:30:11] Quachiri: Finally done with buying everything you can get mounts and pets wise at the Darkmoon Faire. The 1000 tickets for that zeppelin is a killer, but I Finally got it
[2:30:11] cashthb: no
[2:30:17] RanyiTeku: Whats the best expansion to level in as a new player?
[2:30:18] Zuldak: their followers are fine but their troops slap
[2:30:29] blueboywiz: also this event being like brewfest is a great treat. wow devs W
[2:30:31] heldtheline: This is a good way to figure out if it was difficult for everyone or just gnomes.
[2:30:43] Octopixy1971: @Quachiri nice gz hazelTen
[2:30:45] Zuldak: @RanyiTeku anything but Legion. Legion has a quirk where you only get the artifact weapon and there are literally no other weapon drops
[2:30:45] SaraDivine: if you have an alt, you can unlock all the covenants and get the boosts. farm up a bit of renown and you get your first follower to 60 which makes your troops 60 too
[2:30:56] cashthb: yes, the quest even tells you to just follow the smell
[2:31:06] witchhobbit: @RanyiTeku you have to do BFA as a new player but after getting a character to max level i would say legion
[2:31:18] anker_jym: Speaking of exhaust and fumes, have you ever wondered what different locations in WoW would smell like?
[2:31:20] lordhodgy: You guys are the best :)
[2:32:01] GutsInstinctTV: That's the smell of freedom
[2:32:19] saga_no: I've always pictured Boralus to smell like salt water/sea and that tar smell you usually get on ships
[2:32:47] OSTx3: I think the smelliest would be the house of pain dungeon
[2:32:48] lordhodgy: If Stormwind was a true medieval town, it'd likely smell like human waste too 😆
[2:32:57] OSTx3: all that death and constant fighting
[2:33:13] anker_jym: Silvermoon probably smells like perfume lol. I always thought Darnassus would smell nice, but, well....maybe not so much anymore
[2:33:13] cashthb: one mans trash is an other mans wunderbaum
[2:33:21] jeffdmk: I did it pretty quick it was not that bad
[2:33:22] cashthb: that also smells like trash
[2:33:34] saga_no: Orgrimmar smells dusty. That's a given. ;P
[2:33:38] witchhobbit: orgrimmar would smell like dirt
[2:33:58] heldtheline: Darnassus might smell like... potpourri. Like a simmer pot.
[2:34:00] mcxoney: suramar would smell like wine probably
[2:34:05] witchhobbit: yeah sweat and dirt
[2:34:07] witchhobbit: dust
[2:34:14] GutsInstinctTV: It smells like blood and thunder!
[2:34:16] idontknowZo: howdy!
[2:34:18] cashthb: also there a cows!
[2:34:20] GreenArrowed: i always thought thunderbluff smelled like wet hay
[2:34:24] saga_no: Yeh. Sweat, dust, old leather, *heat* ...
[2:34:39] CanadianHeavy: is it super squirt day on Monday?
[2:34:47] pyrosince1985: Sweat, Musk, and Kodo dung
[2:34:47] anker_jym: Lol
[2:34:58] SaraDivine: xufu shows it
[2:35:01] alannatriste: it is
[2:35:02] jeffdmk: super squirt day is so over rated
[2:35:07] Marmoh: Silvermoon smells like your great aunt's perfume
[2:35:10] witchhobbit: omg if thunderbluff was the main horde city i would play horde more
[2:35:14] cashthb: btw one would think that much manure would turn orgrimar into the lushes forest on Kalimdor
[2:35:31] witchhobbit: (obviously would if suramar was instead but that ain't happening)
[2:35:41] blueboywiz: at least you didn’t say suramar
[2:35:48] lordhodgy: Yeah no offense but Orgrimmar is the reason I don't play horde lol
[2:35:54] saga_no: Mine is easily Undercity
[2:35:57] cashthb: they all suck, better dead than red
[2:36:10] saga_no: Silvermoon is too bright/yellow for my eyes to spend much time there
[2:36:20] lordhodgy: Also why can't we fly in Eversong yet??? It's my favourite zone
[2:36:32] pyrosince1985: Thunderbluff smells of hay, but also smells like BBQ when there's an Alliance raid going on
[2:36:33] anker_jym: Well, Midnight should fix the dated problem. Most of the expansion is gonna be Quel'thelas
[2:36:33] GreenArrowed: silvermoon is also an awful maze to not be able to fly there
[2:36:35] saga_no: Orgrimmar is just ~dusty~ and looks like it would be sweltering hot
[2:36:44] heldtheline: I'm hoping we'll get a new Silvermoon in Midnight.
[2:36:47] OSTx3: The unfriendliest place has to be drustvar
[2:36:55] saga_no: Thunderbluff is fine but kinda meh for me
[2:36:57] OSTx3: their lines are so hostile for no reason
[2:36:58] databob1: mmmm death water
[2:38:11] OSTx3: portable, can teach tricks..
[2:38:15] heldtheline: You used to have to kiss that cockroach guy for this holiday, iirc.
[2:38:24] Grez_1: Same with the snake vendor in Org :)
[2:38:27] witchhobbit: @lordhodgy same it is one of my main reasons lol
[2:38:46] random_redshirt: The cockroach vendor is wandering around as a snack vendor at the Orgrimmar event area right now.  Promises that his suspiciously crunchy treats definitely don't contain cockroaches.
[2:38:58] blueboywiz: Ywha the troll snake charmer who sells snakes in org
[2:39:03] blueboywiz: yeah*
[2:39:18] OSTx3: how DARE he >:c
[2:39:34] OSTx3: he's just lost a customer
[2:39:46] lordhodgy: My dream aside from VR WoW is for something to happen to bring back wotlk-number of players
[2:40:14] blueboywiz: do we get dragonflight riding day one of TWW
[2:40:14] random_redshirt: He does also sell cherry pies that seem normal.
[2:40:18] Grez_1: It still seems a bit weird to me to dragon fly in Azeroth but it's awesome
[2:40:29] Marmoh: Every time I log on, I'm always surprised by the number of players around me
[2:40:47] lordhodgy: Maybe my realm is just dead hahah
[2:40:56] Zuldak: I wonder if the devs ever run activity reports and see players in old obscure zones and go 'what ARE they doing?'
[2:41:01] pyrosince1985: At least Pyrewood Village is living up to it's name
[2:41:22] blueboywiz: i do enjoy just using a ground mount in some zones bc they feel bigger and exploration is better
[2:41:56] jeffdmk: That would be a crazy way to die in hardcore
[2:42:17] Zuldak: i remember passing by this place for the first time on my mage but i didnt really stay long. I wanted to get to Hillsbarad because i recognized that name from warcraft 2
[2:42:51] witchhobbit: @blueboywiz same
[2:43:25] wolfcloudchaser80: There was a whole zone that worked like this in Everquest. Kithicor forest was a benign typical forest in the daylight. Night time... .the mobs turned into WAY higher level undead.
[2:43:41] witchhobbit: i love just using a simple saber or horse mount and not flying every now and then
[2:43:44] noenken: proof that WoW has been  the metaverse for almost two decades
[2:43:48] zirpu: yeah, our memory for locations is amazing.  the method of loci, or memory palaces works with using games as well.
[2:43:58] lordhodgy: I started playing wow when I was 8 years old (26 now) so many of my fond childhood memories are tied to Azeroth lol
[2:44:04] witchhobbit: as much as i love dragon flying, the simple small mounts can be really nice
[2:44:09] witchhobbit: and help the rpg feel
[2:44:18] anker_jym: I've had recurring WoW dreams before about zones that don't exist. I had one so often once I forgot it wasn't a real zone in WoW lol
[2:44:22] zirpu: WoW is a part of the metaverse when we can run our own servers. :-)
[2:45:02] Zuldak: I actually didnt really want to play wow when it first came out. i was playing star wars galaxies but that game uhh... had drama so i moved over
[2:45:18] anker_jym: This is a satisfying party list
[2:45:28] Zuldak: SWG made the new york times with what happened
[2:46:31] squishdotnet: hello chat
[2:47:01] Zuldak: one improvement i want to see in wow for tww is no more NPCs following you with quests
[2:47:17] Zuldak: Like Newsy from the zalarak caverns
[2:47:45] Zuldak: i swear all my alts have the daycare intro quest just to make it go away
[2:47:45] lordhodgy: What are you doing with the rest of your day?
[2:48:02] Zuldak: Palworld
[2:48:13] Zuldak: pals dont breed themselves
[2:48:39] viktorxcx: How is the state of the game currently ? I've been thinking about getting back to WoW but I'm not sure if I should :(
[2:48:42] heldtheline: I mean, love is in the air...
[2:49:09] noenken: Number one on my wishlist is no more currencies. Ever. If I do a thing, I want to get a thing ... not an incentive to spend more time on a chance.
[2:49:13] simmelures: How is fishng irl going for you? :)
[2:49:14] mezzasalma: what addon is that?
[2:50:19] Zuldak: now, i wouldnt be upset if trash vendor items were tuned down and gold drops increased to compensate
[2:50:29] databob1: i'd rather have currency than rng
[2:50:37] Zuldak: Korthia was the worst with the grey trash
[2:51:08] wolfcloudchaser80: My pup would have loved the outside time for fishing, but absolutely hated the staying in one spot aspect.
[2:51:09] anker_jym: Unless you train Mr. Moose to sit patiently in a boat
[2:51:31] chops6965: @databob1 agreed, I don't mind working toward a goal
[2:51:53] wolfcloudchaser80: Oh man, that would be a nightmare
[2:51:55] cashthb: can't your mom/sister babysit?
[2:51:58] anker_jym: Ooh, good point
[2:52:22] zaeldron: Hey, I am wondering is that pink blanket available in Love is in the air?
[2:52:31] IanSabrewolfe: Even without the eating, getting a hook out of a doggo's paw is not fun for anyone.
[2:52:39] zaeldron: the one all over the ground
[2:52:44] zaeldron: at the event
[2:52:59] everjaz: @zaeldron id love to have one of those too
[2:53:23] everjaz: yes, the blanket isnt avail
[2:53:31] zaeldron: Yeah, it is not the pink blanket
[2:53:51] zaeldron: its the romantic picnic basket
[2:53:52] OMANEYE: Have you gotten the new ZM hearthstone?
[2:54:15] Zuldak: I love that my hunter has a naturalistic transmog... and a laser zapper from mechagon as a weapon lol
[2:54:30] OMANEYE: I made the initial discovery in the secret finding discord.
[2:55:00] Zuldak: wow... like how did you even think to use an obscure toy like that
[2:55:05] everjaz: @OMANEYE poggies
[2:56:21] Zuldak: im sorry but the dracthyr who are smooth scaled heads look... creepy >.>
[2:56:50] OMANEYE: @Zuldak The theory was already going around that that toy was key to finding the portal. I just happened to use it at the location the shadowlands wormhole generator takes you to in ZM and notice that the animation for the toy was subtly different.

[2:58:47] emerald27x: just curious is this ur full time job?
[2:59:11] squishdotnet: so with the plumber addon do you need to keep the technoscryers in your bag?
[2:59:12] lordhodgy: Having a fave bird is like having a fave colour.. it's very necessary
[2:59:19] IanSabrewolfe: Plumber is impressively useful.  Definitely a no-going-back mod.
[2:59:25] irenecosplay: whats ur zodiac sign??
[2:59:28] Zuldak: why is it called plumber tho?
[2:59:38] Zuldak: like i know why tom cat's tours is named that.

[3:01:41] Cainnar: is reading tea leaves more your cup of tea?
[3:01:42] Zuldak: nonsense, blizz never releases things buggy
[3:02:02] MaddiDJ4: I was upset with my zodiac too. I’m a Capricorn, I wanted to be a Sagittarius though because I was into archery
[3:02:06] helheimr: joining a group of any of the world quests fixed the quest for me
[3:02:10] Zuldak: there is reading the tea leaves, reading the coffee grounds...
[3:02:20] everjaz: as a fellow cap, we get a bad rap
[3:02:22] jamien_10: the last one is on top of the building

[3:03:58] Zuldak: as a scorpio i can confirm not hot and more boring than mysterious
[3:04:34] Kelluthus: Nah, that's all dogs. :)
[3:05:05] Zuldak: yeah not touching the 'hot' subject. Have a nice day :D
[3:05:06] Grez_1: Cheers all
