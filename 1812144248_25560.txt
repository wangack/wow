[7:56:26] patricksalmas: Shaman as tank was originally their design choice
[7:56:40] Itsamemareo96: @shroud weren't shamans supposed to be tanks but they scrapped the idea
[7:56:53] pointone: SoM2 should play around with some shaman skills and make it viable to Off Tank in endgame.
[7:57:17] KontrolStyle: i was playing shaman and kept being asked to tank, but i didn't want that stress
[7:57:22] Magris: i had a shammy tank my scholo and holy shit it was awesome
[7:57:23] derza10: its fine till raids then it gets really iffy

[7:58:46] Kononoke: UBRS probably
[7:58:52] hate_xyz: onyxia?
[7:59:02] ZometTheComet: Shamans tanks were scrapped due to them being SO OP when beside other tank specs they just decided " Fuck it " instead of balancing it back then
[7:59:12] Armabass: explain this HC thing? why the sudden hype?
[7:59:23] wingwong29: Actually it makes sense to have shammy be able to tank. Alliance got pally and they can tank (kinda:P)
