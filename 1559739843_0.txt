[3:57:44] Vile_: Anything sounds stupid if you're reductive about it.
[3:57:53] rabidwargamer: So basically you're saying it's just water with SWEETENER in it /s
[3:58:05] Archiee: that's what marketing teams get paid for

[3:58:46] epiczplz: i always saw hotdogs as bland salads
[3:58:49] ronin_koans: a hotdog is just the worst taco
[3:58:49] GamingDad77: So WoW is just a button pressing simulator with a bunch of shiny pictures?
[3:58:55] Macrodotz: @thedirtyon3 no it aint
[3:59:11] Leeroypaxton: @Towelliee how is the new uldaman?
[3:59:13] r0b928: So what you’re saying is wow is just a bunch of 1’s and 0’s
[3:59:20] Macrodotz: a sandwich is bread there is no bread in a taco
[3:59:22] ronin_koans: a warloc is just an emo hunter

[4:03:08] egrounds: BUT, @Towelliee ITS ABOUT THE GOOD TIMES YOU HAD! :D
[4:03:15] dracullus: @Towelliee of course people who screamed about it 24/7 now are silent
[4:03:35] xziyn: Those 35 anima crushed my soul at the beginning of SL
[4:03:36] hickey7979: you the man towelliee
[4:03:41] CodyKane: its about the journey not the destination!! duh
[4:03:44] Rexialiton: Rexialiton subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 24 months! <3
[4:03:52] Pvt_Cornflower: The problem with most loot currently is that none of it has any meaningful lasting power.
[4:04:03] ronin_koans: 9.0 gearing made me quit the game until 9.2
[4:04:10] lordofmadness: But isnt playing the game reward enough? :) @Towelliee
[4:04:13] Rexialiton: towHAMUP towLove
[4:04:28] hickey7979: i mean shit if the gear lasts 3 weeks thats nice
[4:04:29] EKS90_: old warrior soul.
[4:04:31] EKS90_: for instance
[4:04:31] Macrodotz: true
[4:04:35] Pvt_Cornflower: Right but that’s why having fewer drops feels bad
[4:04:39] Dradugun: I feel it's to stay subbed for one more month. if they increased the rate of upgrades you are done grindin for gear then it shows how little content wow has had recently
[4:04:48] lordofmadness: I like classic gearing philosophy. You get the piece, its good, and it will last a long time.
[4:04:49] uhhhhyeayoo: Rogue daggers :)
[4:04:52] lilwaldo: lilwaldo subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 11 months! Hey dad.
[4:05:17] S1appadabass: I want this token system they have in the current patch to stay forever, where you can straight up buy a piece
[4:05:27] Macrodotz: I hate being a class that uses 2 weps as it's always a pain in the ass
[4:05:31] MasterNewt: Word
[4:05:44] SpoofAvatar: been happening since the Gruul dps trinket in TBC
[4:05:51] grrodesu: people dont want to feel like others playing the game more have an advantage because they get gear they view it as its hard for me to gear because bob wants to play the game more
[4:06:03] im_n0t_jezus: Yas
[4:06:09] gali5656: i just dont want them to do it a replacement patch for missing a tier
[4:06:09] jasperboy: They can do the fated thing as a content drought filler for sure
[4:06:23] EKS90_: The vendors for fated is a really good idea for gearing overall.
[4:06:25] brian_777777777: yeah and titanforging
[4:06:33] Scraggersmeh: Fated should happen at the end of every expansion going forward imo
[4:06:41] hickey7979: tbh this fated added a bit of spice to shadowlands rn but it being permeant would be shit but coming when theyre dry of content
[4:06:43] jasperboy: GIVE BACK TITANFORGING
[4:06:47] LeDerpski: Valor should just be old valor were we can target gear like before
[4:06:47] Dradugun: Use valor or some currency to upgrade an older item?
[4:06:57] kingsmackers: no titanforging
[4:07:00] Vile_: @jasperboy Omg no, get out. Madge
[4:07:02] Macrodotz: titan was op
[4:07:04] kingsmackers: it was so out of control
[4:07:07] falldrgn: what about reforging?
[4:07:07] SpoofAvatar: warforging was ok, titanforging was out of control
[4:07:11] Yagr6: only the top players hate titan forging
[4:07:11] theDirtyon3: just take titanforging away from lfr and normal and you are good
[4:07:13] lordofmadness: Yea lets bring back never logging off the game. Its ok to be done with your character.
[4:07:37] Vile_: @Yagr6 Not a top player here. I hated TF.
[4:07:41] Macrodotz: I agree it only affects top players
[4:07:49] jasperboy: Yes!
[4:07:50] EKS90_: being "done" with a char for a patch cycle. is not a bad thing, and should be something that is achievable to play alts etc. IMO.
[4:07:50] xziyn: You think you do but you don't
[4:08:05] nvnto: i liked m+ items having a chance to become something slightly better. but it should never exceed the next difficulty in power.
[4:08:18] Ant9912: Like MoP ? lol
[4:08:20] strike879: because the whole term titanforging has gotten a kneejerk reaction of it being bad
[4:08:38] Macrodotz: mop gearing was great
[4:08:42] Jack_the_Dipper: The problem for me with that is rng on rng with forging
[4:08:50] xziyn: @Ant9912 It was good in MoP yeah
[4:09:04] Mattsta: isn't what you are describing just what war/titan forging was? wasn't warforging +5 ilvl and titan +10?
[4:09:06] Ant9912: Psure thats exactly how it was in MoP
[4:09:10] brian_777777777: crafting titanforges in df
[4:09:15] Macrodotz: shhhh no
[4:09:16] Scraggersmeh: M+ gear should never be equal to mythic. Mythic requires so much more time, skill and organisation than M+ does.
[4:09:24] lordofmadness: We just got rid of that rng bs, why try and bring it back. Just do mythic if u want mythic gear, same for any of the others. You shouldnt just get better gear cause of random rng.
[4:09:54] Yagr6: just gate keeping tbh
[4:09:54] Moobot: Check out Towelliee's YouTube channel! You can view the most recent uploaded video HERE || The Azure Vault - NEW Dungeon in Dragonflight | THE TRASH IS SO BRUTAL!! youtu.be/ouVgRlaESYU
[4:10:02] wraaith: repeatable vs lockout
[4:10:03] ronin_koans: you cant force people into raiding if they can get gear doing what they enjoy
[4:10:04] falldrgn: I just hate the fact that M+ trinkets at a certain level are BIS over actual raid content trinkets
[4:10:07] xziyn: Still think the ilvl cap in m+ shouldn't stop at +15
[4:10:26] Vile_: @WMfLy They have to cap it at some reasonable measure.
[4:10:30] Vile_: And 15 is pretty reasonable.
[4:10:31] Macrodotz: then there would be no point doing m+
[4:11:01] epiczplz: its enough to at least help clear mythic if you ever want to try
[4:11:04] epiczplz: so tahts a plus
[4:11:05] LeDerpski: Im 293 already so yeah
[4:11:12] nvnto: i would like a solution similar to pvp, where m+ gear scales up slightly in m+ and vice-versa with raid gear. i want to gear for m+ in m+, not raids.
[4:11:20] S1appadabass: hear me out Titanforged Transmog, those normal shoulders you just got, boom mythic appearance
[4:11:23] Keyastaron_: @Towelliee  the valor cap is off rn
[4:11:29] Keyastaron_: iits uncapped
[4:11:31] Keyastaron_: in season 4
[4:11:46] dwolters_the_zombieman: i got to do pvp to get gear in order to do fated raids that's sad
[4:11:46] Moobot: towHAMUP Follow Towelliee on twitter so you can be in the know at all times! | twitter.com/towelthetank towKawaii
[4:11:50] Rottencoarse: yeah there is not a valor cap this season
[4:11:53] Vile_: @NVNTO Making PVE gear scale differently depending on the PVE content you're doing would NOT be a good idea.
[4:12:12] ItsGigg: AYY CARAMABA Enourmo damage papi
[4:12:24] Rottencoarse: they're also removing the conquest cap next week
[4:12:25] xziyn: Yep fuck the pit lord - melee player
[4:12:29] EthicalHermit: they just need to put in scaling for it for other players
[4:12:32] jasperboy: EL POLLE DE PIT LORDAN
[4:12:33] DrakeDuude: imagine 4 locks and playing as melee when those are cast lol
[4:12:38] ronin_koans: @NVNTO as someone who only has time for a few dungeons a day and cant dedicate 9 to 12 hours of my life per week this would be great. if m+ gear scaled up to mythic ilvl in m+ thats fine. i dont need mythic gear for world quests
[4:12:43] Stariot: how is demo lock in alpha
[4:13:21] strike879: pit lord should come with a size glyph best of both worlds that way big mode for fantasy small for keys
[4:13:22] S1appadabass: hey now
[4:13:25] Vile_: @koanstation That's not a problem with the system, it's a "problem" with how often you're able to play.
[4:13:26] Macrodotz: lloks mint
[4:13:30] Macrodotz: looks
[4:13:39] ItsGigg: Demo have any options or fillers to cast while moving?
[4:13:41] Elwine: !% wipe
[4:13:46] Elwine: 1%
[4:13:53] Ribastur0075: have you tried +-
[4:14:54] Ribastur0075: have you tried affli yet? singlle target is supposed to be rather complex.
[4:15:11] LeDerpski: can you put the curses on the side bar so they stop auto adding?
[4:15:29] ItsGlime: you think they will test ALL the bosses or not the last ones again
[4:15:54] dracullus: I would prefer 4 raids with 7-8 bosses instead of 3 with 10-11
[4:16:03] xziyn: Would be nice to have a hidden boss, been a while

[4:16:12] ninetysix: hows locks lookin ?
[4:16:14] Farikov: Imagine loading into a Bg and the enemy team has 6 demo locks that cast pit lord on u
[4:16:21] gali5656: OhMyDog
[4:16:23] matthewkshearer: My wife got alpha access on Tuesday it’s our first experience with and alpha test, will that mean she will have beta access as well?
[4:16:34] Cidal_: yES
[4:16:43] Cidal_: Yes*, she should have beta as well
[4:17:48] Kneckt: that sounds sick
[4:17:50] Scraggersmeh: The dungeon journal for the next boss opens up when you kill the boss previous.
[4:17:55] rohdey: battle pass?
[4:17:56] LearnedSomething: like LA adventure journal
[4:18:06] Kneckt: PogChamp
[4:18:13] ronin_koans: @Vile_ i think gimping a persons abillity to do dungeons at a competitive level because they cant dedicate a third of their waking life to raiding is a systems problem.  if mythic plus ggear scales up in mythic plus it solves that problem and also raiders wont feel forced to run it, everyone wins.
[4:18:15] LearnedSomething: oh that's poggers
[4:18:15] Kneckt: thats really cool
[4:18:19] LearnedSomething: cool idea :)
[4:18:23] UltiCarnagee: More Dinar PogChamp
[4:18:30] Moobot: @zer0thehero117 ALPHA PHASE 5 8/9/22 and we are getting the Ohn'ahran Plains and lets start a rumor - Holy Paladin and 100% Monk talents ?!?!?
[4:18:31] Hyelander_: Yea but Addon makeers will share their full unlocked version as an addon
[4:18:32] P4weZ: but you find those anyway like wowhead or someting :s
[4:18:32] dracullus: and you upgrade it with ALMANAC POWER
[4:18:39] happybooger: that would be interesting
[4:18:39] Vile_: @koanstation I think you're being incredibly hyperbolic and I'm not gonna discuss this further lmao goodness, my dude.
[4:18:43] UltiCarnagee: ALMANAC POWER GIGACHAD
[4:18:50] Ceelottv: Like a bestiary. Updates as you play against the boss or mob or whatever
[4:18:52] Damuffin14: that would be much better imo
[4:18:58] leaprah: so basically, like it was in the older xpacs
[4:19:00] jasperboy: that would be interesting for the race
[4:19:00] Hyelander_: You will get and addon that shows everything
[4:19:05] saltyohm: what will the dungeon journal catch up mechanic be?  because you KNOW they'd implement one.
[4:19:21] Orczeus: anything that makes it harder for mythic raiding the beter lol
[4:19:27] Scraggersmeh: Right but the second one guild kills it, everyone would know.
[4:19:33] innov8te: No like after first people clear it, they willl leak the dungeon journal online
[4:19:34] Scraggersmeh: So the progress would last for the first guild kills it.
[4:19:49] P4weZ: @innov8te ye that i was thinking
[4:19:50] happybooger: that system would only work until the RWF is over but i like it
[4:19:58] Revoca: I mean it could work you're telling me they can't field 20 raiders in the Blizzard office via the employees for testing it
[4:20:25] dave_seer: LUL
[4:20:26] LySiS75: Exactly like me lol
[4:20:27] LearnedSomething: haha
[4:20:29] LearnedSomething: what's up
[4:20:31] LearnedSomething: what's new
[4:20:33] unc0de: wait
[4:20:34] ItsGigg: ItsGigg subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 2 months! Hey Towelliee, just wanted to say I'm really enjoying the alpha content. Appreciate you brotha
[4:20:36] Neruan: 20 reasonanble capable raiders no way

[4:20:41] egrounds: @Towelliee Been gone since classic, what's new?
[4:20:44] Zippaya: I'm one of them :D

[4:20:49] Squirrel_nutty: whos primus?
[4:20:51] DreamSweet: He a bad guy?
[4:21:01] lordlowdar: When was the big switch to Horde?
[4:21:18] Vile_: @lordlowdar P sure it was like 2 years ago, if not longer.
[4:21:20] superpudd: Bout to finally make my pally a dark iron, so excited
[4:21:27] Scraggersmeh: @lordlowdar 10+ years ago

[4:22:02] SouvlakiTheBest: can you show new lock abilities please
[4:22:08] LySiS75: Honestly i wish they would make tank more fun to play somehow so that queues can be faster
[4:22:38] EthicalHermit: it fits with the RPG elements of the game too
[4:23:56] Seerated: Dreadstalkers do more dmg than the Imps, at Live though
[4:24:15] SouvlakiTheBest: appreciate it
[4:24:19] DrakeDuude: problem with tanking is dumbass dps doing shit messing up everything lol
[4:24:24] notColt45: Are we not? :P
[4:24:52] iiTornTunaii: tanks always get boring trinkets
[4:25:04] HeatherJC83: i tried tanking and i sucked lol
[4:25:04] Moobot: Plans for WOTLK LAUNCH! Marathon from Sept 26th - October 1st! This won't be like TBC Launch. Since this launches around DF Beta and DF Launch. We will still no life it and get Pre-Raid BiS. I AM PLAYING ON FRESH!
[4:25:12] rodimusprime085: With the new crafting system Give tanks/heals shit for crafting
[4:25:14] Daddecool: Cataclysm had it right with the loot bags that had chances at some decent items or mounts, etc.
[4:25:16] xziyn: Some rare mounts like in MoP too
[4:25:19] rodimusprime085: Boom they have a reason to do mythic
[4:25:21] Keyastaron_: supply and demand Kappa
[4:25:24] notColt45: You used to be able to pay them gold for a dungeon but who needs that any more?
[4:25:26] SouvlakiTheBest: true they should do that
[4:25:26] xziyn: Tanks getting Al'ar with that shit
[4:25:33] Vivelli: i just didnt like learning routes as a tank
[4:25:34] ItsGlime: having to study routes like a school project isnt fun either LUL
[4:25:39] LySiS75: that's a good point once they get all the gear, its a waste of time to queue
[4:25:41] jerseyfive: keep tanks happy this game goes to s#it if no one wants to tank LUL
[4:25:46] MereMortal: Oh, too much loot is the problem? Then just reduce the amount of loot people get Kappa
[4:25:58] liama_in_a_taco: give wow a mount for clearing 15s x amount of times as a tank @Towelliee
[4:26:09] EthicalHermit: Other than Lower Kara, all the dungeons in S4 are super linear, as far as Tanking goes.
[4:26:17] EthicalHermit: It's a good time to start tanking
[4:26:31] Hyelander_: A pat on the back
[4:26:32] dimofodi: bonus valor
[4:26:35] superpudd: I main boomie/bear, but Prot Pally is feeling so good right now
[4:26:35] WhoIsAndrewJ: yo what that eyeball in the bottom doing though
[4:26:38] rodimusprime085: CRAFTING MATTS in DF
[4:26:41] ItsGigg: I'm trying to get into my warrior tank, but i feel like i'm so far behind. Just started playing the game and the character brand new. Anyone have a guide I can look into to "catch up" I'm overwhelmed with the systems in s4
[4:26:42] rodimusprime085: IN SATCHEL
[4:26:47] Velarn435: Satchel with lower gear for an alt?
[4:26:57] dannyis1337: they should do it like timewalking and get badges for cosmetics and mounts and toys
[4:27:06] gali5656: lower kara suckssssss
[4:27:09] superpudd: GD is free this week
[4:27:12] xziyn: Blizzard ‘Best we can do is 35 anima'
[4:27:20] LeDerpski: This is an easy week
[4:27:28] SoniicFusion: i only did a 13 on lower kara and did like 18s on everything else to get the season mount lol
[4:27:30] bawheid: pugging mythic+ as a healer is not good for your mental health
[4:27:32] EthicalHermit: The Curse of Tongues bug is funny
[4:27:37] soshiecho: have you messed around with destro yet? @Towelliee
[4:27:58] abracka_: nobody is interrupting spellcasters just sitting in it. big sad
[4:27:59] iiTornTunaii: lower is the worst yet again, grimrail is okay
[4:28:04] happybooger: sanguine is the worst
[4:28:06] soshiecho: destruction warlock
[4:28:23] angrywowplayer1337: So I watched the new Prey movie. Not going to lie, the scene where it killed all the French dudes might be the funniest thing I’ve seen in ages.
[4:28:25] Neruan: grimrail is actually not as bad as i expected im suprised
[4:28:38] Tirony: i like sang, it like tank check but some places just dont work for it
[4:29:01] powertrippingtwitchmod: im digging the gaming room setup lol
[4:29:04] Talecell: seems like botanica
[4:29:17] angrywowplayer1337: Good, every expansion needs one dungeon that makes people rage. It’s how you separate the bozos
[4:31:06] reeaperz1: fr
[4:31:07] soshiecho: we cry
[4:31:08] procyon_mfc: you get numb to it
[4:31:09] Orion280: they don't they just yell at the healer
[4:31:11] Molvonos: You just orb walk
[4:31:16] Molvonos: You move between GCD
[4:31:16] elizondria: the answer is don't play demo
[4:31:21] reeaperz1: annoying asf
[4:31:32] elizondria: destro or aff are way easier dealing with that
[4:31:38] superpudd: Cast Starfall profit
[4:31:51] procyon_mfc: destro can walk during conflag gcd
[4:31:51] Woodland_Critter: You get kind of good at it, orb walking basically. Some specs are worse off than others.
[4:32:10] Neruan: just dont  move if you die its healers fault
[4:32:22] Molvonos: Cast, Move, Cast, Move, Cast, etc.  You base the spell you can cast on how far you have to move.  Instant casts for long movements, etc
[4:32:29] Woodland_Critter: Just hit Dark Pact and ignore ground effect. Also an option.
[4:32:40] ItsGigg: You just let it hit you, thats what your groups health stones are for, they heal you too Kappa

[4:34:42] Molvonos: That's not Dark Pact.  That's a DPS cooldown
[4:34:56] pavepawns: isnt that what he asked for?
[4:34:59] Woodland_Critter: Probably didn't spec into Dark Pact
[4:35:21] Molvonos: @pavepawns He asked for Dark Pact, lol
[4:35:28] pavepawns: i guess i missheard
[4:35:59] TheCliffyShow: @Towelliee Scream "alpha" like Dave does Alvin in Alvin & the Chipmunks. I just think that would be funny.
[4:36:06] Molvonos: Nah, Dark Pact is a bubble
[4:36:14] procyon_mfc: are pets pretty much unkillable by AOE in dungeons these days?
[4:36:19] Woodland_Critter: Its a massive shield.

[5:28:32] ShintzTTV: prot paladin harder to play than bdk
[5:28:46] Aidler: US and EU together or global launch are things they should and could have done a long time ago
[5:29:27] Treehop: @Towelliee  Thoughts on Twitch's 180 on Covid for TiwtchCon?

[5:40:16] WolfofWarSong: lower kara most of all
[5:40:30] boedy1: the only reason why demons feel like they hurt more on fort week....is because the mobs next to them hurt more
[5:40:32] Exxcar: I can't remember @Towelliee do you prefer focus or enegery Advanced?
[5:40:38] TheFox0228: Kara has some pretty massive overtuning along with those nathrian guys for the affixes. hurts to heal D:

[5:46:56] Vaesandryn: @reaprwolf Has no maltodextrin either which spikes blood sugar even worse than just sugar
[5:47:15] Macrodotz: I prefer thc
[5:47:40] HoboFighter2: Did they say why they aren't stocking it anymore?
[5:48:14] spookychefkarolina: @hobofighter2 likely supply issues
[5:49:14] spookychefkarolina: @towelliee have you put any of the flavors in sparkling water?
[5:50:03] Macrodotz: @spookychefkarolina good idea
[5:50:27] BLACKFOOT_TN: @Towelliee  Have warlocks banish one of the elementals just before its dead. And then when you kill the last one use its bubble. Then use the banished ele's bubble too. Warlocks and other dps ascend and the boss just melts.
[5:50:31] Vaesandryn: I would, but I'm a DH and usually have 2 paladins in my group
[5:50:45] ultimatebutt: i usually carry at least one as the tank
[5:51:24] spookychefkarolina: @macrodotz thank you! I think it would be like candy flavored soda lol

[5:59:45] Highparkk_: yep you're right was my bad
[6:00:03] xdarkwombatx: i was saying "by average" running backs only have 4 to 5 good years. I used Gurley as example because he was great and even he couldnt last long lol
[6:00:08] strike879: towelliee going brewmaster irl
[6:00:25] Highparkk_: for sure lol, gurley was over worked but most rb are

[6:26:12] Tandipants: @Tirony sames
[6:26:21] Spacy_Dude: @Zilberg Yeah that's another one. There's just a lot of oneshot mechanics in that dungeon so it sucks to PUG lol.
[6:27:01] KylerNA: Pretty sure the gears are fortified.
[6:27:15] Zilberg: I agree @potato_chipper People just expect you to know on the first day what every mechanic is instead of learning … I’m okay with failing a key if someone learns a new mechanic that’s half the fun in the game imo
[6:27:16] Tandipants: Cake

[6:27:59] ArcaneMaki: Not just a tank, a drunk tank.
[6:28:14] Spacy_Dude: @Zilberg For sure! That's how I learned moroes. Luckily had a chill group of people and we tried it 3 times before we figured it out.
[6:28:21] WolfofWarSong: naw
[6:28:32] Tandipants: Just let it happen @Towelliee
