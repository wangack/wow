[0:18:52] CanlexLive: @Molvonos ah gotcha. well luckily it's gone by fast.

[0:23:07] spookychefkarolina: Hey if I win one, I’ll donate to the mods. I’m just here for the fun and insults.
[0:23:11] Sollice: @Sollice Really doesnt bother me. I wont play it. I am on the New World grind and will be up until DF release so I am happy
[0:23:24] CanlexLive: Fair enough
[0:23:24] TweektheProphet: He will tell you when the giveaway is open and then it will be a # but not until he tells you it is open
[0:23:30] Sollice: 30 Broomba. Thats the most anyone got
[0:23:34] Broomba: @Sollice what server are you on in NW?
[0:23:46] Affiiance: towHAMUP Morning Hammer Squad
[0:23:48] PigPenLen: @Sollice Thanks for being considerate!
[0:23:49] Sollice: Eden right now, but we think there will be fresh with Brimstone and thats what I will do
[0:24:12] Javiz: Sollice ready for another chaotic day lmao
[0:24:12] HonestPhilosophy: Eden went all purple immediately heh
[0:24:13] Broomba: i tried to create a character castle of steel but its locked for new charactrers
[0:24:13] Sollice: @Codedheart That was a key from like 24 hours ago. Please update your bot
[0:24:19] CanlexLive: I heard NW isn't that great. True or what? I have't really played it
[0:24:28] TweektheProphet: @Sollice if they do a fresh server i would 100% go back and try NW again
[0:24:29] Supergluten: tbh (to be honest) i like like this stream
[0:24:32] Sollice: @HonestPhilosophy Yeah it did. Kind of sucked. Thats why I look forward to fresh
[0:24:34] krobane: @Sollice hey ive been curious. Does Towelliee share all of his juicy insider knowledge with his mods?
[0:24:52] Sollice: @krobane Ehh not really. We have big mouths LOL
[0:25:03] krobane: thats fair
[0:25:29] Sollice: We know enough to help with the stream as it should be.
[0:25:40] CryptClash: sollic good luck with all the spam thats apparently going to happen >.< i dont envy you dealing that :/
[0:26:01] Sollice: @CanlexLive New World had a LOT of growing pains. It's in good shape now. Its a game probably released 6 months too early last year
[0:26:08] spookychefkarolina: Wait I thought Molvonos was a mod, my immersion has been ruined
[0:26:14] Sollice: Molv is a mod
[0:26:22] Sollice: its not just me that does everything
[0:26:27] Broomba: @Sollice is the new fresh server on NW going to be east or west?
[0:26:30] CanlexLive: @CanlexLive oh well that's good to hear. Maybe after the initial DF boom, I'll give it a shot
[0:26:30] Molvonos: lol
[0:26:31] spookychefkarolina: LUL

[0:27:53] Tamianth: :)
[0:27:54] Destector: same
[0:27:59] ZenLiving: Honestly, implementing achievements, adding a lot of spells to classes, and adding the class DKs makes Wrath feel much closer to retail than BC or classic.
[0:28:02] TheGiant99: I want to start over so I'm really hoping for the fresh start server

[0:28:37] dawngrove: hoping we get some bear news soon
[0:28:37] Sollice: People who play retail=randys People who play Classic=Crapys.... You can see which way I lean
[0:28:45] Ravencro: @pixirex did you done secrets?
[0:29:06] Tamianth: nope, not yet
[0:29:07] Sollice: @ShadyXVXX Yep. We do the giveaways during the stream

[0:29:20] Tamianth: bad health keeps interfering :/
[0:29:21] Retiosanti: 4 times, 3 for 3 1 for 1
[0:29:23] Sollice: I am a Randy :)
[0:29:23] ZenLiving: @Holysal I am beginning to see that. Lots of good quality of life added, but it makes the game way less like the Classic days, and seems like a bigger jump to retail than maybe even Cata.
[0:29:39] ShadyXVXX: @ShadyXVXX okay, so not just the screen with chat which is running rn?
[0:29:54] spookychefkarolina: Pouring one out for all the Moobot abuse that’s going to take place today. She never catches a break. towBeer
[0:29:57] foofighters182: key plz
[0:29:59] dwarfmarv: hey people
[0:30:16] Wuzze3393: how do we get a key ?
[0:30:18] Holysal: @ZenLiving I think cata was a bigger jump but i get your point
[0:30:19] Sollice: @ShadyXVXX Correct. He does this at the start of the stream so folks can shuffle their way in, get coffee, make breakfest etc before the stream really starts
[0:30:23] Destector: steps for DF key anyone?
[0:30:29] kansan_cowboy: Someone wanna give me a super quick synopsis of what this game is?

[1:25:38] belaham: tauren mill
[1:25:39] AvrithSATX: Saw an ad on another Twitch channel for DF about a week ago.
[1:25:49] HaxzorJimDuggan: south barrens is pretty good at this level
[1:25:51] Funderik: we need more cgi stuff, bfa had alot and sl slacked big time on it, need MORE

[1:26:50] HaxzorJimDuggan: honestly im just gonna make a evoker mess around for 30 minutes then log off until pre patch
[1:26:53] Pight314: Yeah but like player word of mouth is the bread and butter of advertising for them, like how many people come back to the game because of buddies talking it up. I think they have better more targeted adds these days
[1:26:54] PokerFaceMoose: @pent217 gotta move the decimal one more place

[1:28:14] captivate7: agreed
[1:28:23] Dasbesta: I think 80% of players don't care too much about the intricacies of the talent tree and just wanna smash
[1:28:26] Funderik: too many people are thinking this a class rework and expecting brand new everything.
[1:28:27] dozencola: Affliction warlock also not happy
[1:28:40] vulkanuntotheanvil: good :)
[1:28:47] CanlexLive: Anyone want some Guava pastries?
[1:28:52] gsev7n: Next key giveaway?
[1:28:53] Honvar: The only change I need is that they make archeology  relevant again @Towelliee :)

[1:29:30] brimes: dude guava and cheese is amazing
[1:29:40] gsev7n: My abuelita loved guava and cheese
[1:29:41] karanloss: Yeah they need endgame content tested. I fear Evoker Preservation having a too big disadvantage because of the 25 yards limit and possible weak singletarget healing, but need proper endgame content to test that.
[1:29:46] glittergirl2022: I'm going to attempt to play elemental shaman but the tree looks scary!!!
[1:29:47] Dasbesta: Pizza and pickles mate
[1:29:47] TweektheProphet: @CanlexLive oh hell yeah Guave and creamcheese is amazing

[1:30:54] gsev7n: you're probably low on vitamin D
[1:31:00] 91Niki: @TP_Phone_Home First, you take your pants off and put them on your head, then you spin around 20 times one way, and then 13 times the other way. Jump 3 times, and then stand on your hands for 2½ seconds. Then it should magically show up on your bnet account Kappa
[1:31:01] Kinghorn: you will die if someone looks in your direction Benxsmith
[1:31:05] ArcaneSyntax: @towelliee you gonna respec deep prot at 60 for hammer? it's big Pog damage.
[1:31:08] gsev7n: I was the same way until I addressed my vit d deficiency
[1:31:09] TheUnknowing: im the opposite man, caffeine does nothing for me.
[1:31:09] glittergirl2022: I actually quit caffeine it was easier than I thought it would be

[1:31:24] BionicMagician: 22s for 20
[1:31:28] CanlexLive: Dude caffeine does almost nothing for me. It sucks

[1:55:25] Sollice: Azerite armor was awesome. And the vendor was even better
[1:55:26] sabernn: feral has a similar thing but it kinda just builds upon your main cd, not chop it up
[1:55:41] CanlexLive: @TacDuc so it adds like a little sweetened w/o being overwhelming?
[1:55:56] BethioMoo: I think Arcane mage needs another playstyle than Kyrian again for DF
[1:56:03] diivil92: @Sollice i put mine in void storage
[1:56:10] TacDuc: @TacDuc I think so, and I think that I will make it soon, because now I've been convinced

[1:56:33] DeanoTV: KEKW
[1:56:45] HaxzorJimDuggan: 23 was  the most deathknight in one av i saw
[1:56:49] sabernn: i just dont want trees to be overwhelming and massive by the time its 12.0, would make new players scream in agony
[1:56:51] DeanoTV: @crazyhussar no way. people been crying for a new talent tree for YEARS
[1:56:52] 91Niki: !beta

[1:57:57] Retiosanti: @mavict79 It seems like they added a bunch, but then again they talked that up in Legion too and it wasn't... particularly engaging
[1:58:02] crazyhussar: @crazyhussar There is absolutely no way they keep spriest, destrolock and several other trees untouched by the next expansion. 5 more points? That would bring you way ahead with the current tree

[2:11:29] Jango_: go troll somewhere else
[2:11:36] the_general01: @Nuttballl doubtful with people like you calling wrath 10 year old trash
[2:11:45] gsev7n: new world had so much potential, and they rushed it
[2:11:49] Nuttballl: 10 years of content vs 1 year. obviously wow is better

[2:16:55] Ambersulfr: even when the bigger streamers switch like that to try and boost a game, sometimes it crashes servers.
[2:16:55] 91Niki: TotalFPS aka Kevin said something yesterday that very much applies to this as well. Someone felt "guilty" for playing both COD and Battlefield. Kevin's reply was spot on: "At the end of the day, we're all gamers - we celebrate each other, play lots of games, and enjoy good times!". Play what you enjoy, and enjoy that SeemsGood Anything else is unnecessary drama

[2:39:21] Dasbesta: towCry
[2:39:21] Karbonn: We also dont know how long the RIOT MMO has been in development do we? It's entirely possible that it comes out before Ashes.
[2:39:25] ThQbi: !wa
[2:39:25] Moobot: @ThQbi we use Luxthos's WeakAuras! You can find all his WAs at wago.io/search/luxthos |You can find the leveling EXP bar here! | wago.io/LuxthosExperienceBar
[2:39:32] AlexTheKingQc: lil bit expensive..
[2:39:33] luckfore: riot > blizz towCopium
[2:39:46] Aiywen1: @Towelliee Everquest still gets away with the 15$ modle
[2:39:59] MILESkg21: Swtor couldve been great towCopium
[2:40:01] Flexxster: even SWTOR went f2p
[2:40:13] szble: It’s gotta be very good to get away with it
[2:40:15] c0mmander_starscream: EVE Online is currently dying due to raising their sub to $20 a month
[2:40:16] HaxzorJimDuggan: everquest players are a different breed
[2:40:17] wEiRdO_dUdE: Free to play has a lower barrier to entry, that's why it works so well....people can get hooked on it easily
[2:40:19] Galadeon: So much red
[2:40:25] happyspot: Bet Riot MMO will have an optional subscription like ESO and SWTOR
[2:40:27] Mourningztar: no box price though
[2:40:29] NILLme: riot is the only company in quite awhile that have the potential to make a mmo that can rival wow
[2:40:30] TweektheProphet: EQ also come from that era of sub gaming on MMOs
[2:40:31] DevineDragoon: it'll be same on tehr team moist likely lol
[2:40:32] ButterY0urBread: yea but other then story the FTP is SWTOR sucks
[2:40:33] Aiywen1: 50-70k on EQ1. bout half that for EQ2
[2:40:33] Gelomorte: But SWTOR you just sub once and you get all the content up until then
[2:40:34] androyd6360: towelliee any chance for a beta key, I have an idea, look at our time played and achievents that ay you can see who deserves it
[2:40:40] SaltyShu: is this retail?

[2:41:13] gnaril84: bring back Wildstar :)
[2:41:13] Karbonn: I feel like any NEW MMO charging a sub is going to be a fail model. Only reaon WoW, FFXIV, etc get away with it is because they have history behind them.
[2:41:17] luuidzz: Damn I came back to wow with a fresh account, 5k achiv points LULW

[2:42:13] wEiRdO_dUdE: Steam gets games to customers; a lot of people have it installed...it's distribution
[2:42:32] Mecabeast: something like uninterupted game time or sub could work
[2:42:40] TweektheProphet: I'm out here lvling my warrior and forgot how long/hard it is to lvl one

[3:36:11] Watts__: Nov 28th, Ah, just in time for finals week moon2SUFFER
[3:36:16] BeeboBiggins: Nov 28th is when it’s good n ready
[3:36:21] Eshel: Well nevermind - y’all answered while I was typing - f’n psychics man LMAO
[3:36:27] lyana54: I would like to thank you for all the great streams you do, keep it up .
[3:36:47] OwlyOwlman: The leak seems pretty legit tbh
[3:36:47] Honvar: Because you know Kappa
[3:36:48] MILESkg21: seems legit SeemsGood
[3:36:50] Evilbreed83: makes sense to do it after thanksgiving
[3:36:55] NILLme: warzone 2 was also confirmed last night
[3:36:59] Sollice: I think with Blizzard now sending out reminders for people to get their achievements and mounts and shit from Shadowlands
[3:37:09] XerciusGaming: The timeline just makes sense regardless. No reason not to believe him
[3:37:09] luuidzz: Mined and herbed my way to 3 mill gold just waiting for evoker unlock LULW
[3:37:11] N3llee: he connected
[3:37:19] XerciusGaming: @Sollice Very good point
[3:37:20] Eshel: As I recall they typically release on a Tuesday though right?
[3:37:25] OwlyOwlman: leaks get things trending, probably a deliberate thing as marketing
[3:37:29] Syrakkis: heck, there's a rumor that the leaker is Ion or someone else very high up
[3:37:31] TacDuc: I'm not saying that they told us the date, but I got my tinhat on
[3:37:35] MrFuzzynuts420: Wait, what dates?
[3:37:37] Veyloster: they are just waiting the wotlk launch to announce all date
[3:37:39] Honvar: It is Ion himself Kappa
[3:37:43] Shadowstarz: blue posts on priest says cutting dev is sus 28th Nov is right
[3:37:55] Moobot: Giveaways will be done periodically in the channel during special events or #Ad content.
[3:37:58] GamingDad77: towTinfoil towTinfoil
[3:38:00] lalelusa: will they attempt a global DF launch à la Wrath, though?
[3:38:16] BenKross: @Towelliee haha I was the paladin chasing u
[3:38:24] Sollice: @lalelusa No way
[3:38:24] TacDuc: They let the hype carry itself
[3:38:31] Sollice: Wait when you said global
[3:38:49] Sollice: You mean releasing all over the world at the same time? Yes they did that for Shadowlands. They wont do NA day 1 and EU etc day 2
[3:38:49] Moobot: towHAMUP Follow Towelliee on twitter so you can be in the know at all times! | twitter.com/towelthetank towKawaii
[3:38:50] luckfore: dragonflight is last expac and they gonna focus on adding stuff to classic
[3:38:50] TooLock: what was the report?
[3:38:55] Eshel: So wouldn’t 29th be more likely - being a Tuesday ?
[3:38:56] NILLme: MW2 and Warzone 2 release dates were also on that leak and both of them were confirmed to be correct
[3:39:01] TooLock: Report?
[3:39:12] XerciusGaming: Oh the outrage if it ends up not being November 28th. The community were PROMISED that release date !! jedithLol
[3:39:20] TooLock: what was the report leak?
[3:39:21] Sollice: @TooLock No. NA will release Monday night and it will be EU Tuesday morning
[3:39:29] onesadkeanu: If Blizzard is not pushing Dragonflight, maybe they have enough interest that they are not worried about. I am sure they have analysts crunching the numbers.
[3:39:31] N3llee: it was a excel project mngmt timeline of possible launches and marketing event stuff
[3:39:46] OwlyOwlman: @luckfore super doubtful
[3:39:56] loutre_malgache: Pre-patch the earlier the better for everyone. People want to try talents on raids
[3:40:00] azuriens: hes lying, I know the date Kap
[3:40:10] Whitemamba236: Kappa
[3:40:11] mithraw: beta key hype is real :D
[3:40:11] lalelusa: @Sollice yes, exactly. After SL release, I never heard anything along the lines of "yeah, no, let's not do that again". I'm all for global launch at the same time
[3:40:15] SevilonSihlen: i just hope they dont release it early for the sake of getting out of shadowlands. i dont want to see another wod esque xpac
[3:40:22] Sollice: On big projects you set a date. Then you have a go no go call a couple of days before if shit is going out the window
[3:40:25] Cucci_Gaming: #dragonflight
[3:40:28] zeeAbe: It puts the game out by the deadline or it gets the hose again.
[3:40:36] ShadoodHD: hey towell hey chat towHAMUP

[3:40:54] Whitemamba236: yea its all about the player retention

[3:41:04] Sollice: #nonsystemsuntilwemisssystemsandwewantsystemsback
[3:41:07] Blackicedragoon: It seems mostly done. They could release it October and probably be fine. I don’t think it’s rushed.
[3:41:11] r0b928: Im thinking about coming back for it
[3:41:11] lalelusa: I'll be re-subbing in November!

[3:41:34] thebakeriscomingforu: bears need some talent adjustments. Just not as many ways to navigate the talent tree compared to other tanks.
[3:41:37] SevilonSihlen: i hope they dont add some other shit system.
[3:41:40] wazza76: weap is 19k sheild is 9.5k

[3:44:30] AllenzoTV: @Luuidz dungeon leveling is fun sometimes, if ur tanking or healing its a bit more engaging
[3:44:38] Exxcar: @Exxcar I did ops for one of the big techs, and people would be surprised how often things actually get pushed back last minute
[3:44:38] D3athMas: KomodoHype

[3:49:30] N3llee: cool
[3:49:35] MattJ063: On the beta and PTR is it known that the new UI when trying to customize that shit will start snapping behind other stuff?  Also the quest tracker is not moveable at all
[3:49:35] Moobot: I will be leveling a toon on the NA Fresh Server Maladath (Normal) 8/30 when servers go up. Not doing anything special guild wise just leveling to get a Paladin and DK ready for WOTLK Launch

[3:57:41] Exxcar: Didn't Ion recently say that they were starting to feel on Retail that the concept of a server was starting to deminish? Since so much of the game is cross-server and cross faction anyways?
[3:57:47] Holysal: it was more successful than anyone thought it would be tbh
[3:57:56] Sykrin: fresh and new servers with no transfers is the new hype

[5:12:05] SevenSlots: Cant watch the dog and play wow
[5:12:08] AvrithSATX: People don't even pay attention to their children... why would they pay attention to pets?
[5:12:09] BigHijinks: maybe it's a lonely housewife trying to get banged
[5:12:11] Mecabeast: but that's logical
[5:12:15] Xeltoris: Used to have a neighbor down the street, could always tell when the neighbors weren't home for a few hours. Their dog would just come walk in our front door and chill on the couch while family watched TV. LOL
[5:12:18] BadXo: "You know, your dog might actually not like you, that's why it's running away!"
[5:12:33] Kakotan2143: Some Dogs are escape artists too but a lot of it is people not securing their environment better @Towelliee
[5:12:36] felegolas: Idk my dog watches me lol
[5:12:42] lithium364: i generally think evokers wont be as popular as people think, clunky range for casuals and restricted transmog
[5:12:45] nocturnal_2195: my dog sits on my lap while I play wow
[5:12:50] Meccka: what about Soda's dog?

[5:13:55] stallowned: do u have like auto pass on or something?

[5:16:13] SLoPPYALieN: Need before Greed says you don't get the loot because you are too low level. That's what I've experienced before

[5:17:02] curterth15: Honestly, I am super hyped for Wrath of the lich king.
[5:17:05] ArcaneSyntax: it's ethical to ninja from DKs though
[5:17:06] Pight314: nbg makes it so peeps cant roll on stuff they cant use

[6:25:27] RetiredNavyVet: @Towelliee not really; there is a thing called higher tenure; if you don't make the next rank in so many years they force you out
[6:25:36] Broomba: there is a lot of retired navy vets in chat!
[6:25:42] Syrakkis: high year tenure for O3 is what, 8 years? byebye
[6:25:42] Darquesoul: you cap out after so many years

[6:25:55] michaelmm: At his rank it's acceptable to stay there.
[6:25:56] schneid4: but hes tom cruise they wouldnt force him out
[6:25:57] Eggspoached: That movie is highly unrealistic
[6:25:58] Axyorix: From the sound of it, Iceman was pulling strings to keep him in
[6:25:58] snake_like: KEKW SteerR that's his secret: he's always in the danger zone
[6:25:58] ShaunsterTheMonster: But it's a movie and he's tom cruiiissseeee

[6:26:11] Squirrel_nutty: unless he got demoted?

[6:26:24] CurtleTheTurtle: Need a heals maladath ramps
[6:26:25] Meltedskull: @Towelliee your paygrade doesn't go up, but he can get bonuses for being an instructor. You do get a time in service paybump but it's minimal compared to rank increases.
[6:26:26] Ziephier: Air Force
[6:26:26] Aidler: but he is such a good pilot… naguuraGiggle

[6:26:33] RetiredNavyVet: @Towelliee sure, there's always politics and who you know, blow, etc.
[6:26:36] Syrakkis: no. stop-loss is a thing, but there's a hard limit
[6:26:37] Eggspoached: The Navy wont put together a team like that either, a strike like that would go to the closest carrier group.
[6:26:37] SpoonManes: chain of command baby that can absolutely happen
[6:26:40] theBatwolf: Test pilots can...to some extent, do whatever the fuck they want though, especially when they have and admiral up to bat for them.
[6:26:40] thrashadin: @Ziephier DAMN A 24 YEAR TECH???

[6:27:14] Carbondi: more responsibility
[6:27:15] Darquesoul: you get paid for your time in service
[6:27:15] Sollice: I think higher ranks cant fly

[6:27:19] Carbondi: who the hell wants that
[6:27:22] gunnjiausjumunji: Gunnar is actually my name lol xD
[6:27:22] snake_like: time served, knowing multiple languages, your MOS. a lot can still fluctuate outside of rank
[6:27:24] Alert_Phase: Def higher ups can help in the military. Also they do go into detail a little that he kept getting in trouble and sent to new locations. Possibly he ranked and knocked down to capt again. They don't describe enough.
[6:27:24] demizzle181: captains do not have High year tenure
[6:27:25] Ziephier: @Brautiwurst  he made Tech near the end of of his time in Air Force
[6:27:26] d1stract10n: only once we are close to retirement
[6:27:30] alucardais: i mean he is flying jets
[6:27:30] thrashadin: @Towelliee my Wing Commander told me that
[6:27:30] michaelmm: He's also in a highly specialized role
[6:27:33] Xemron: @bighijinks heckonAhi
[6:27:37] Meltedskull: @Towelliee Yes. There's people who do not want to be forced into the admin side and just wants to be hands on.
[6:27:37] Blackicedragoon: I like how they used Penney. She was mentioned in the 1st
[6:27:39] Miskav: "I wanna earn less and be insulted" katieDerp
[6:27:39] NBK_Sethus: yeah that's possible, ranking up puts you in an office
[6:27:40] TacDuc: Sometimes higher ranks have much more responsibility and tasks, and it's not worth it
[6:27:40] LearnedSomething: yes the movies are real life T :)
