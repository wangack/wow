[3:36:40] rbubbaray: idk maybe cause I had arena gear in wrath, pvers wasnt much of a issue
[3:36:41] fierceknight: @Swifty lol i remember tuning into cartoon network when i was 12 and saw wotlk rofl
[3:36:44] karajobob: no in wotlk 3.3.5 its a flat dmg redcution 1k resil = 20% flat dmg reduction

[3:42:43] Metalcalfe: A lot of people quit cata right away
[3:42:58] kelnyolo: @LightKernel stuff*

[3:44:34] Shalyon: do u remember ur oneshot macros in cata stacking full mastery?
[3:44:48] kelnyolo: @Metalcalfe nope... you felt weaker cause you didn't have the 30% icc buff
[3:44:58] rbubbaray: every arena had a blood DK and they were so strong they ruined the game
[3:45:09] Shalyon: i remember the duel mercader vs blood dk with full heroic gear , the 100k gold duel
[3:45:13] Metalcalfe: Oh yeah that's right
[3:45:34] LightKernel: @Swifty What's your suggestion to Ion on what follows Wrath?
[3:45:35] vejji_: each phase it got 5% stronger till the final phase
[3:45:40] vejji_: so people could actually kill lich king
[3:45:43] rbubbaray: @LightKernel yeah warmane is good
[3:45:59] aggedev_: cant wait for warlord of draenor classic
[3:46:14] kelnyolo: 5% buff per 4 resets @Swifty
[3:46:19] Frybowl: monkaS
[3:46:22] rbubbaray: I found LK was the easiest fight, once ya know it
[3:46:26] Shalyon: i think they should just stop at wotlk
[3:46:30] rbubbaray: yup of course
[3:46:39] kelnyolo: so after 24 resets the buff come to 30%
