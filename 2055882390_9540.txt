[3:05:25] Edeslash: everyone hates the PI and aug shit the game has now
[3:05:28] Edeslash: so you make hero specs
[3:05:33] Edeslash: and 50% of them are support effects
[3:06:45] Zerothiaan: I just dislike all the random external sources of power, I don't want to need PI and Aug buffs and stupid paladin weapons on the floor to be able to hit a dps check somewhere

[3:10:35] Snizzlenose: why cant blizzard just make PI self cast, why do they keep doubling down on PI every expansion Sadge
[3:11:19] Edeslash: @Snizzlenose yeah like literally everyone who is doing high end pve wants PI gone but i feel like blizzard is on a philosophical quest to make logs and damage meters matter less and less
[3:11:29] Edeslash: the game 1 vs game 2 meme they've talked about
[3:11:35] Edeslash: they're doing everything they can to defile game 2
[3:12:31] Zerothiaan: @Snizzlenose That is exactly what they are doing essentially.
[3:12:33] Mazmerized: The competitive integrity of your damage is why a lot of people play this game over xiv, gw2 etc
[3:12:39] Zerothiaan: If not intentionally, then as a by-product
[3:12:40] Edeslash: also the gameplay implications of buffing your allies are very different from the "cool" class fantasy that is related to it
[3:12:58] Zerothiaan: but as teapot just said, logs don't really matter for anyone besides hardstuck heroic players with nothing better to do.
[3:13:06] Edeslash: @Mazmerized and yeah i think this is a very important point as well
[3:13:13] Zerothiaan: Which is fine, I guess.
[3:13:38] MightyTeaBot: Subscribe to the stream to become an epic gamer! PogChamp bit.ly/tpotSub
[3:14:21] Edeslash: but from my experience tryharding parses like that is the difference between 97 and 100 and that feels like a meaningless difference anyway
[3:14:25] Zerothiaan: WoW and FF14 are like the only two games where people genuinely care about DPS parsing.
[3:14:26] Edeslash: but a PI might take you from 85 to 95
[3:14:53] Mazmerized: @Edeslash this^
[3:15:26] Snizzlenose: I just hate that PI centric design just made blizzard decide that they need to make a whole hero talent tree created around PI and buffing, they could have made something much cooler for holy/disc
[3:15:37] Zerothiaan: I got 98/99 parses without even really trying because the person usually getting PI was on an alt. Usually I was parsing like 94s because I was clueless with Assassination lol
[3:15:55] ViviLouF: Bedge
[3:16:01] Edeslash: @Snizzlenose yeah absolutely, like you all hate this button right? well fuck you it's now even more central to your gameplay identity
[3:16:15] Zerothiaan: I think ultimately though, PI is just boring, and it's annoying to use a cooldown for someone else.
[3:16:48] Mazmerized: pi this pi that, all i want is self cast on shadow so people stop whispering me
[3:16:51] dhrokir699: Parsing is so gay
[3:17:02] Zerothiaan: For shadow it should 100% be self-only
[3:17:07] Zerothiaan: I don't really know why it isn't.
[3:18:53] Zerothiaan: The thing I actually dislike about PI though is when you're playing smth like UDK, and you get omega nerfed because PI exists, but if you don't get PI you're just in shambles lol.
