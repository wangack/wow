[1:49:00] DeadxGirlxGames: we're paying just shy of 7k ourselved to get the fuse boxes rewired and switched to breaker boxes a tthe house we are purchasing
[1:49:08] DeadxGirlxGames: it is wild.
[1:49:28] DeadxGirlxGames: I need to become an electrician
[1:50:34] DeadxGirlxGames: that doesn't inclide there is still knob and tube wiring that is live in there
[1:51:13] DeadxGirlxGames: they said that it is updated electric so I am not sure if they just decided to leave the old wires or if it is not actually redone lol
[1:51:14] Rmont: never show your tube and knob
[1:52:11] DeadxGirlxGames: but yeah I called them and told them there is knob and tube, it is a WHOLE thing. we asked our realtor to get it all looked at and she only got him to look at the fuse boxes. I did not see any mention of it in the quote and was like.. oooh I should call
[1:52:17] DeadxGirlxGames: lol rmont
[1:52:49] grassgummy: hi everyone

[1:53:33] DeadxGirlxGames: well the realtor had to set the inspection up since we have no access to the house
[1:54:11] DeadxGirlxGames: and we asked for the electrical inspection for the knob and tube and the breakers and there are some wall plugs that do not work. and she only set up an inspection for the fuse boxes alone.
[1:54:20] Zoos_tv: my family is involved in construction, and man the inspectors, realtors, and appraisers can be so annoying. Feels stupid that realtors are even necessary.
[1:54:57] LumberChopMan: I strongly dislike dishonest people...
[1:55:39] DeadxGirlxGames: yeah I called her and was like so I spoke to him and now the quote has nothing to do with the expense we were trying to get put in the contract.

[9:29:43] SavedEight_ZGZ: i started going down the rabbit hole "Bread vs Bun"
[9:30:20] SavedEight_ZGZ: according to me, not by google.... Bread is a loaf which yields many servings, whereas a bun is a single-serving baked product.
[9:30:53] SavedEight_ZGZ: im kinda bummed thats the difference
[9:30:54] Rmont: that thing you showed was multiple servings for a non-fat ass
[9:30:56] AmandaMarie_ZGZ: LUL LUL
[9:31:02] AmandaMarie_ZGZ: @Rmont it was a pack of 6
[9:31:03] AmandaMarie_ZGZ: lol
[9:31:11] Rmont: sounds like multiple servings
[9:31:12] SavedEight_ZGZ: nah its 1 serving ;)
