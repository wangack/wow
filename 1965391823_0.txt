[1:53:20] Fanrogh: +frostgear is not worth at that lvl cause your spells are so fast so the spellpower % utilisation is so low so youre better of having stam int gear
[1:53:22] Raskolnikov666: did you just started to play WoW?
[1:54:40] emmettimid: Nice
[1:54:40] Fanrogh: at the slowest frostbolt goes it utilizes 90% of your spellpower so if it normally does 100 dmg and you have 100 sp it will do 190
[1:55:14] Fanrogh: fireball uses 100% when its at its slowest
