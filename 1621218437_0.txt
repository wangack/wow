[1:07:19] PBnJealous: You don't do anything with that flag, Towelliee. It's part of the warsong farms quest.

[1:08:49] JFeezy__: Have a sneaky feeling Warrior and Monk are gonna be top tier tanks this expac. No way they let DK stay at the top for that long.

[1:15:28] raldrik: So the game industry has now officially gone from, lets deliver a good product because if the cartridge isnt correct there is no going back. To now... we are going to deliver a bad product to the point where we don't feel comfortable rolling out fresh servers until after the bugs get worked out.
[1:15:46] Mecabeast: project 60 was only really to farm mounts right
[1:15:46] Ertra: @lloydizm it's the luxthos weakaura

[1:19:48] JFeezy__: I just hope this whole expac has a different feel to it. Personally wasn't a fan of shadowlands. Borrowed power stuff was getting a little much for me.
[1:19:57] Secondbreakfasttt: so many people will wait for fresh servers and not gonna even bother with new brimstone Sands
[1:20:25] EpicJune: their realm reborn...hopefully LUL
[1:20:26] Sollice: @Mellkorrrrr I am going to make a new character for the new leveling experience on regular servers so I can know how to power through them
[1:20:37] BlewGamingGroup: if only they would have taken our advice in the beta when we told them it needed another year of beta to get everything working right
[1:20:38] Sollice: So when fresh start comes up we can power through and claim shitsward

[1:30:07] danimoto10: its getting pushed for suree
[1:31:08] DogShep: Can we not talk about bear tanks? It hurts too much
[1:31:23] abracka_: they'll push this shit out the door kicking and screaming
[1:31:25] Thoreya: gonna try out feral druid on beta later today after work
[1:32:04] PBnJealous: to the taunka village
[1:32:05] Velashen: Game also has a lot more developers working on it than it has in a long time. People need to relax and stop the doomer mindset.
[1:32:07] Tausgi: If DF is as bad as shadowlands would you say its beginning of the end for wow ?
[1:32:14] ItsDerpDiggler: They're not gonna push. In my experience over the years I've noticed they like to release xpacs before Xmas so they can have a "Holiday Sale" where the Xpac is like 30% off right around Xmas and sell more copies after launch lol
[1:32:15] Mecabeast: take to the goblin with the parachute
[1:32:27] FearFreak13: all the way back to tank (there is only one) but cant let her get attackes
[1:32:42] PBnJealous: It's only 1, and you escort the donkey back to the village
[1:32:43] FearFreak13: town*
[1:33:20] its_mr_duck: do you think allot of people will still PLay WOLK after DF is out?

[1:34:43] abracka_: @Critcobain how i feel exactly
[1:34:43] im_capy: no need to rush out raids for the sake of retail
[1:34:44] Getitonthelow: I stopped playing half way through shadowlands got bored with it… think. DF is worth coming back to? I don’t play with alts
[1:35:07] NiteshadezTV: I got my hopes up for the last 3 expansions, really dont wanna do that with DF lmfao.. joined a raiding guild in Wrath
[1:35:10] im_capy: ya.... :/
[1:35:24] zombie_snacks666: two raid logging alt heavy expansions, gonna bounce between both frequently
[1:35:36] im_capy: This season is gonna be BIg for profits if the diablo pre purchase is there too
[1:35:49] Featherbow: @Getitonthelow do or don't. it's up to you.
[1:36:10] im_capy: ya

[1:37:29] Tausgi: what
[1:37:31] Featherbow: to the goblin
[1:37:33] Sylibusttv: @towelliee have you heard any rumors about WoW coming to Xbox after Microsoft takes over?
[1:37:37] Dred_Scythe: @Towelliee Todays last day to sign up. Could start any time after.
[1:37:39] Lazugo: yeah d4 beta starts today
[1:37:44] Strouss: yeah contract one
[1:37:48] Tausgi: aaah I see
[1:37:59] StreamElements: Use code POGTOWEL120 for $120 off at https://strms.net/TowellieeFactorMarBot #ad
[1:38:02] BlewGamingGroup: yup
[1:38:12] zombie_snacks666: yeah
[1:38:24] WhatAboutBob71: Microsoft bought wOw?
[1:38:26] Tausgi: yolo it
[1:38:37] Strouss: not really "sign" but had to accept terms of the NDA. not to share ect.
[1:38:38] mozavich: @WhatAboutBob71 they bought activision/blizzard
[1:38:42] WundertueteGER: wait the beta is under NDA? Sadge I was excited for some beta streams
[1:38:43] ArcaneMaki: @WhatAboutBob71 Activision BLizzard
[1:39:02] Featherbow: @Towelliee you had an npc from warsong hold to escort to the crossroad
[1:39:05] WhatAboutBob71: So are we getting a Clip-it pet?
[1:39:13] zombie_snacks666: oh someone will leak it for sure, especially a game with that much hype around it
[1:39:31] MarquisLek: d4 alpha is the new "casino"
[1:39:53] Featherbow: warsong hold
[1:40:25] Featherbow: Go back to Warsong Hold and talk to the orc outside a pen full of alliance
[1:40:34] taogeht: !xp
[1:40:44] Kaldune: @Sylibusttv Too many abilities for WoW to ever play well with a controller. The only reason it works for ESO is because they designed it for consoles from the beginning so you only have 5 abilities on your hotbar.
[1:41:02] ottavianni: ottavianni subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 30 months! towBeer towHAMUP towHAMUP towHAMUP towClap
[1:41:33] mozavich: @Sylibusttv @Sylibusttv @Kaldune idk about that. people are already playing wow on steamdeck
[1:42:15] rockytcp: well FF14 has a lot of abilities too an plays very well on controller
[1:42:15] Moobot: towHAMUP Follow Towelliee on twitter so you can be in the know at all times! | twitter.com/towelthetank towKawaii
[1:42:29] EpicJune: game pass would be sick
[1:42:34] Gingerprimer: @Towelliee have you/do you plan on doing any Nax raiding on your Paladin?
[1:42:35] Asxius: WoW runs amazing on Steamdeck, so maybe that's why
[1:42:36] mavericks312: wow has no business being on console lol
[1:43:03] CritcobainTV: "LFM for so and so raid, must send discord screenshot of your keyboard and mouse"
[1:43:10] NBK_Sethus: normal raid hard run - console players only
[1:43:12] mozavich: lol
[1:43:13] WundertueteGER: @Asxius that sounds comfy, playing wow on steamdeck
[1:43:40] Mecabeast: can't even get 10 people at 80 to be logged in same time on maladath
[1:43:40] Moobot: I will be leveling a toon on the NA Fresh Server Maladath (Normal) 8/30. 3-4 Day Mini-Thon for Launch. Gonna hit Max Level and get some quick gear!
[1:43:55] Sylibusttv: @kaldune I don’t think abilities will be the issue. I think addons will be the issue tbh. Because if you use triggers/bumpers as modifies with A,X,Y,B that’s like 20 buttons alone
[1:44:02] magemaster225: reset is hitting in 1.5 hours gonna be rough
[1:44:12] slaughteredpig: no
[1:44:18] hippieh8rlol: Dragonflight does bake a lot of commonly used add-ons into the game... maybe stuff like dps meters and dbm are on the way too
[1:44:34] mozavich: towelliee, there's a few early morning raiding guilds on mankrik that raid 9am server
[1:44:57] TombStoneMercenary: east
[1:44:58] BlewGamingGroup: east
[1:44:59] Featherbow: East
[1:45:00] mozavich: east
[1:45:07] PigPenLen: east coast baby
[1:45:19] Dcarter: That’s what I’m dreading finding a new guild to raid with
[1:46:02] EpicJune: The say, fuck it and block DBM Kappa
[1:46:09] BlewGamingGroup: to put wow on console that would have to really dumb the game down to just a few button rotation
[1:46:09] Moobot:  Please visit towelliee.com to get caught up on all of the latest Youtube videos, Discord links, sponsor information and news/events that may be coming up in the stream!
[1:46:19] Dcarter: Bout to be no addons allowed like FF14 lol
[1:46:26] Proto_Paradigm: @Towelliee what about integrating the "core" addons for grouping in to the console version.
[1:47:02] Proto_Paradigm: fair
[1:47:07] slaughteredpig: I quit during WoD. Still can't get away from the community though
[1:47:07] racketpunch: They need Discord on consoles for WoW to work
[1:47:24] JQ47: I feel like it would have to be classic
[1:47:27] Sollice: Nah I think console will come out on their own servers
[1:47:32] Gingerprimer: @racketpunch discord is on consoels now
[1:47:32] Moobot: We got Discord servers! Featuring giveaways, live twitter feeds, live news from Wowhead, memes, pets and more! Subs even get their own private lounge! Join HERE | discord.gg/towelliee |
[1:47:33] Sollice: cross play between ps5 and xbox
[1:47:34] Sylibusttv: @racketpunch it is
[1:47:42] falldrgn: @roadrrunnerr1 FF does a good job of playing on a console, it would be something similar to that
[1:47:43] Dcarter: No console allowed groups
[1:47:45] s0lstep: @racketpunch discord works with xbox now
[1:48:03] TotallyNotRaien: oh you should never give classic to console players, console players want the exact opposite experience
[1:48:04] racketpunch: Lol good to know. Shows the last time I was on console. Thanks all
[1:48:04] Mecabeast: cross play with pc would need to be disabled otherwise there would be way too much toxicity
[1:48:10] PokerFaceMoose: its alot of work to port something. and idk that they want to  spend the time or money to make classic work on consoles
[1:48:28] TyulSK: does wow even support controllers?
[1:48:34] TotallyNotRaien: yes
[1:48:39] falldrgn: @TyulSK yes.
[1:49:00] CordovaGC: could you imagine tho being in a BG an getting stomped out by a console player LUL
[1:49:18] N3llee: wow on steam deck
[1:49:28] Jarless: steam deck ftw
[1:49:28] EpicJune: my mates playing it on the Steam deck
[1:49:32] Mecabeast: hell wasn't ff14 played on a dance pad
[1:49:37] im_capy: wow and Skyrim, can be played on dam near anything
[1:49:42] BlewGamingGroup: i seen a toaster modded pc
[1:49:54] falldrgn: Imean if they can get OG doom running on Notepad at 60 FPS, wow can play on a controller or an older PC
[1:50:08] zombie_snacks666: gonna be the next doom, which can apparel be played in notepad
[1:50:26] TotallyNotRaien: console players would have a stroke trying to play druid on a controller
[1:50:28] Sollice: XBOX can also use keybolard and mouse
[1:50:34] Sollice: So.....
[1:50:49] CordovaGC: True @sollice
[1:50:51] Strayer_J: i play WOW on my SteamDeck lol @Towelliee
[1:50:59] Mecabeast: yeah sollice has a point xbox does support mkb
[1:51:00] zombie_snacks666: yeah I have a wireless kb/m for my Xbox, it never gets used but I have one
[1:51:02] TotallyNotRaien: true they could add a warning that the game is better played on K&M
[1:51:06] ArcaneMaki: I could picture myself playing WoW on my 77 inches OLED TV sitting on my couch.
[1:51:25] TotallyNotRaien: @SollowJP you can do that rn
[1:51:32] BlewGamingGroup: i play on a 40 inch
[1:51:38] jkitchin75: its on steam deck
[1:51:45] mavericks312: @SollowJP just dont expect to get invited to endgame shit lol
[1:51:50] Scoodles91: or wireless mouse keyboard :D
[1:51:53] im_capy: my neck hurts thinking of it
[1:51:53] heydjzs: im playing on my couch with a lapdesk
[1:51:56] Bernardo994: I cant
[1:51:56] EpicJune: Steam decks got a dock, hook that shit up chat
[1:52:00] Skyymarshal: 27" max
[1:52:06] theDirtyon3: 27 inches is already too big almost
[1:52:12] JFeezy__: 27 meta
[1:52:13] zombie_snacks666: I could get behind using a controller to sit on the couch and level alts/farming
[1:52:17] Mecabeast: I'll stick to my 24.5"
[1:52:22] abracka_: that's what she said
[1:52:29] TotallyNotRaien: id love doing boring daily content on my couch
[1:52:29] bob_the_demon: Dual 32"
[1:52:35] Rottencoarse: @Towelliee  morning man :)
[1:52:36] Sollice: I play New World on a 77 inch OLED with Atmos
[1:52:40] Sollice: and its  GLIOUS THING
[1:52:42] theDirtyon3: i just got a 27 in 1440 monitor Kreygasm
[1:52:42] ArcaneMaki: Yeah everything controller related would be stress-free (no dungeons, raid, pvp :D)
[1:53:06] N3llee: @Towelliee you didnt make it to Twitchcon did you?
[1:53:13] zombie_snacks666: I mean normal and heroic dungeons maybe but that's about as far as if go @sollowjp
[1:53:43] ArcaneMaki: @zombie_snacks666 Exactly.
[1:53:46] Shamwise: I run WOW on a 34 inch curved monitor, and its fine, and im old:)
[1:54:03] barberbranford: Just heard about the injuries at Twitchcon. OUCH
[1:54:03] Rottencoarse: @Towelliee  you read about ppl getting hurt in lenovo booth in twitch? :D
[1:54:34] TotallyNotRaien: yeah she broke her back in two spots
[1:54:38] Rottencoarse: @Towelliee  some1 broke her back in 2 places
[1:54:40] N3llee: 9 people hurt themselves
[1:54:40] 91Niki: Broken her back in two separate places. Fucked up
[1:54:43] TotallyNotRaien: it was a 1ft deep
[1:54:44] TaNGoIX: I mean the setup was dumb af LOL
[1:54:44] mavericks312: didnt someone break there back
[1:54:47] PokerFaceMoose: what is crazy is she wasnt the first one to get hurt and they didnt close it

[1:54:49] diamondprone: when they said foam pit they meant stone pit
[1:54:55] N3llee: well 9 people became injured
[1:54:56] Rottencoarse: @Towelliee  another one dislocated her knee and broken her ankle
[1:54:56] barberbranford: 3 people did. They just put some foam cubes on a hard floor WTF
[1:55:03] S1appadabass: @towelliee adriana chechick got her back finally blown out by a ball pit, who saw that coming
[1:55:07] maccaruso: They signed waivers so they are almost certainly shit out of luck
[1:55:07] TotallyNotRaien: those need to be at least like 6feet deep
[1:55:09] hotrod66impala: sorry I can't hear you but i've heard that maybe coming to playstation & xbox is this true or just a wish
[1:55:30] NBK_Sethus: F
[1:55:32] PigPenLen: @S1appadabass LMAO
[1:55:33] 91Niki: One would think that after one or two people getting hurt that you would shut it down lol
[1:55:34] mozavich: @maccaruso waivers mean shit in cases of neglect
[1:55:36] TotallyNotRaien: lawsuit incoming hopefully that is beyond gross negligence
[1:55:39] Rottencoarse: @Towelliee  they cant sue them tho they signed waivers
[1:55:43] Molvonos: She didn't just fall.  She launched themselves off of it
[1:55:47] TaNGoIX: The video of the woman that broke her back was literally a butt drop of like 5 ft
[1:55:48] Sollice: Waivers do not apply for gross negligence
[1:55:48] barberbranford: Can't beleive it took 3 people to get hurt before stopping it.
[1:55:49] hotrod66impala: that wow maybe *
[1:55:53] Southpaw123: Waivers dont mean shit
[1:55:54] TotallyNotRaien: waivers dont protect against bodily harm due to gross negligence
[1:55:57] BlewGamingGroup: waiver dont mean shit if there was gross negligence
[1:56:11] TaNGoIX: 100% what Raien said above ^
[1:56:13] GamingDad77: I don't feel sorry for people like that. They get what they deserve for being stupid.
[1:56:16] BobLongMVP: Waivers? Lol we’re taking California here
[1:56:17] Zettabyte: Screw playing WoW on monitors, @Towelliee. WoW in VR would be Pog Kappa
[1:56:24] TombStoneMercenary: Play a stupid game, Get a stupid reward
[1:56:26] PwnW0lf: idk signing a waiver isnt an end all be all if there were clearly major safety concerns
[1:56:39] mavericks312: play stupid games get stupid prizes
[1:57:03] BlewGamingGroup: lenovo
[1:57:05] Rottencoarse: @Towelliee  lenovo
[1:57:06] TotallyNotRaien: probably both
[1:57:10] PigPenLen: Venue
[1:57:10] PokerFaceMoose: there is some level of expectation of not falling into a death trap
[1:57:18] Jollywhompus: Usually there is a third party vendor associated with setup
[1:57:18] Sollice: Twitch if they put it together Lenovo just sponosred
[1:57:22] S1appadabass: whoever is responsible for setup i imagine
[1:57:22] TweektheProphet: both realy i think Lenovo at the end but you could sue both
[1:57:27] Dred_Scythe: Could be both...
[1:57:27] raldrik: twitch, lenovo, company who set it up, venue, insurance company for all of those. All of the above
[1:57:28] TotallyNotRaien: twitch con allowed the venue to stay open and injure more people
[1:57:37] 91Niki: One thing is being dumb and throwing yourself around in that pit. Another is running it and neglecting to shut it down if MULTIPLE people keep getting hurt
[1:57:37] GODZILR1: wouldnt the event have to carry insurance of some kind?
[1:57:40] N3llee: if i was a attorney i would go after everyone.. then see where things stick
[1:57:45] t_train_va: State law is going to dictate what rules and laws apply
[1:57:47] Strayer_J: tbf it wasnt a fall, they did a cannonball lol, regardless dumb all around, proper safety wouldve prevented injury
[1:57:50] t_train_va: Every state is different
[1:58:01] Joemercy_: yrh
[1:58:17] TaNGoIX: Ya how tf you gonna blame the people that got hurt saying "They're stupid"? They joined a game...
[1:58:17] TyulSK: Also if there is a standard depth of those type of pits. If it didn't meet standards then there is possibility for liability
[1:58:21] EpicJune: big oversight by whoever built the pit
[1:58:23] BlewGamingGroup: they will both be brought into court . with lenovo taking the brunt of signing the check . twitch puts the event on . they are not totally responsible for what their vendors do , but they will be named in the lawsuit
[1:58:26] PwnW0lf: image having this event and one person gets injured and youre like "YEAH SEEMS OKAY LETS KEEP IT OPEN"
[1:58:27] Sneekzx: what happened?
[1:58:36] PigPenLen: regardless, she will no longer have to do porn

[1:58:42] Zucchey: Somebody will hire Saul Goodman
[1:58:46] mozavich: @Strayer_J proper setup of the pit would have prevented them from being sued
[1:58:54] S1appadabass: Better Call Saul
[1:58:58] letsrock_pt: call saull
[1:59:10] Strayer_J: @mozavich thanks for repeating what i said
[1:59:16] Sneekzx: "only get paid if you do and we take most of it" KEKW
[1:59:19] tmiguel27: Better Call Saull
[1:59:24] PigPenLen: In SC all you have to do is dial ALL 9s
[1:59:34] Featherbow: She broke her back in two places and had to have a metal rod inserted
[1:59:46] Tausgi: whaat ?? really
[1:59:47] 91Niki: Somebody who never designed a foam pit before
[1:59:53] Sollice: Yes
[1:59:55] N3llee: security apparently was a major issue with a lot of female streamers. Apparently some female streamer was lick in the face touched by a mob of fans.
[1:59:57] EpicJune: she jumped back first and everything
[2:00:06] Sollice: @Towelliee Have to if they had to stablize her back with a rod
[2:00:08] Proto_Paradigm: Also someone that was instantly fired.
[2:00:13] Rottencoarse: @Towelliee  yeah she already got the surgery done
[2:00:18] Rottencoarse: yup
[2:00:28] GamingDad77: they probably rushed it so she could get back to doing porn
[2:00:35] mozavich: @Strayer_J proper safety could mean user safety. your statement was ambiguous at best
[2:00:40] Rottencoarse: @GamingDad77  lol
[2:00:43] TweektheProphet: that bounce she made after finding out it was concreate is gross
[2:00:47] Featherbow: @GamingDad77 she couldn't MOVE.
[2:00:55] Reaghol: can get parts off it
[2:00:58] BuffiDoinks: I got back surgery coming up in January, gonna be rough
[2:01:02] Strayer_J: @mozavich fair dinkum

[2:04:49] DRKM: Hey @Towelliee how u doin
[2:04:51] 91Niki: Cuz twitch try to overwrite the adblock
[2:04:53] PhillyDilly18: @raldrik Same! towHAMUP

[2:06:32] mavericks312: arent they paying well for ads to have more ppl to do it
[2:06:39] Ralandis: The sneaky anti-vaping ad popped in there. Twitch, plz elliot120Tighdrate
[2:07:02] slaughteredpig: @tdoh__ hobbHi
[2:07:16] raldrik: It makes sense, as a digital marketer I can say that our CPM's have gone way up. More people are advertising, not a lot of ad inventory to buy out there
[2:07:43] greenonmymind: ads are preventable with just a simple google search
[2:07:44] zombie_snacks666: ads don't bother me, I grew up in the 90s. 3 mins of add every hour is better than 6-7 mins of add every 30 minutes

[2:08:53] Seerated: It's moving towards what advertisers pay TV-networks for commercials. Maybe in a few years Twitch will pay the same crazy amount
[2:09:08] 91Niki: @zombie_snacks666 Yeah but those ads you are referring to, also didn't prevent you from seeing a movie. You wouldn't miss out of 3-5min of the movie because of ads. Here you miss out on a LIVE stream cuz of ads
[2:09:15] SauceFu: Just buy Turbo
[2:09:15] Snabido: @Shrenko callings give a decent chunk, adds up if you bother on more chars

[3:45:27] CritcobainTV: tank out dpsing all 3 dps Sadge

[4:06:42] CritcobainTV: did you forget about dre?
[4:06:43] freefella: Did you see jose stats compared to judge
[4:06:51] mavericks312: yankee fans gonna be in shambles if there swept
[4:06:58] Animemron: @looney199725 Ah thats good to hear. I was told to go brew for my guild. Was worried it would be sub par.
[4:06:58] colbylikethecheese7: @looney199725 how about brewmaster tank?
[4:07:01] Lilamanela: @looney199725 wasn't it prot paladin who makes the most overall damage on beta?
[4:07:02] LeGoogs: Chapman is gone man you havent heard?? @Towelliee
[4:07:14] muzicz: I missed this stream, so fkn chill.
[4:07:18] wade_2go: what ur take on the Judge vs Bond HR record?
[4:07:23] PigPenLen: last NYY series swept was at the hands of Franconia.. just sayin
[4:07:48] Wulfgrym: pre and post cheating
[4:07:49] cigarette_butter: steroids should be permitted in all sports
[4:07:54] mavros_kyrios: aaaawwJudge is going to assume the name Mr October from Regie Jacksonaw
[4:07:59] JackedDown: KEKW
[4:08:03] muzicz: And you chose your mods well.
[4:08:11] looney199725: @colbylikethecheese7 im on about brewmaster tank its the highest dps tank its amazing on beta rn brewmaster/vdh/prot warr are like top 3 tanks currently
[4:08:22] MIKEBRASKA: Batters had to use PED's to keep up with those PED/substance pitchers. It's just part of the game's history.
[4:08:28] pereadin: I haven’t done keys this season. How are they?
[4:08:35] MILESkg21: imgaine allowing Roids LuL
[4:08:40] cigarette_butter: let the biggest freak win
[4:08:41] firehawk73: Can't hit home runs if you don't pitch to him...just sayin
[4:09:03] sarcasmfont: Ohtani would be a monster on roids
[4:09:08] Maydie6066: I would like to propose a new super MLB league where ONLY roids are allowed..
[4:09:17] muzicz: Australian<--- understanding nothing about this baseball convo.
[4:09:19] pereadin: Ohtani is the GOAT
[4:09:22] JFeezy__: if they allowed roids in football there would be literal deaths on the field. Those guys are already huge.
[4:09:25] looney199725: prot pala is bugged
[4:09:28] looney199725: so it doesnt count
[4:09:32] mozavich: if a man can't stand, a man can't hit a homerun
[4:09:42] SLoPPYALieN: @Maydie6066 And don't care about gender.. just roids and smash that shit.
[4:09:47] BigQonU: All meaningless because Braves are repeating
[4:09:48] looney199725: how much overall is your overall on prot pala?
[4:09:53] freefella: Jose had 120 Rbi Judge had 130 lets be real
[4:09:54] looney199725: brewmasters doing like 44k overall
[4:10:07] cigarette_butter: rules goes against the spirit of sports
[4:10:16] Crafty_plays: Couple of things. Steroids don't help you hit a baseball. it helped them stay healthier and recover more quickly. There were other things going on during that time frame, "live ball era" to help increase the popularity of baseball. Baseball was the most exciting it has ever been when people were taking roids.
[4:10:19] CritcobainTV: KEKW
[4:10:20] MILESkg21: wtf KEKW
[4:10:22] Kakotan2143: towHi towHi towHi
[4:10:32] mozavich: @my_lifes_a_screensaver what sports are you watching where there are no rules?

[4:10:37] freefella: It prety close dog yall be praising jduges
[4:10:37] mavericks312: if ohtani wins the mvp this year the award is a joke
[4:10:46] firehawk73: I'm a guarians fan, and you must be on crack if you think Jose is better than Judge

[4:10:50] Crafty_plays: @mavericks312 ??
[4:11:13] Crafty_plays: Ohtani had a GREAT season as a hitter and a GREAT season as a pitcher
[4:11:19] freefella: I never said he was better but givve jose some respect
[4:11:23] MIKEBRASKA: @mavericks312 you're insane lol
[4:11:35] beezly33: Judge missed the triple crown by a few points in batting average.  There is no comparison this year
[4:12:02] Wcvechten: Steve Danuser just confirmed it was an error and that Khadgar is NOT a dragon
[4:12:16] Frewdicey: @beezly33 If Ohtani didn't win last year it wouldn't be close.
[4:12:23] Frewdicey: But since he did, it's Judge's MVP
[4:12:27] looney199725: @Towelliee brewmaster with the correct talents rn on beta is destoying keys in m+ they have dmg every pack they not locked behind needing wings or avatar for huge dmg
[4:12:28] MILESkg21: @Wcvechten LINK ??
[4:12:35] PigPenLen: it takes a stat year like this year for Judge to win the MVP. Ohtani is that good on both sides
[4:12:45] Wcvechten: newest wowhead post @MilesKG21
[4:12:48] smashwow: @Wcvechten aka he saw the backlash and went nope Kappa

[4:13:21] MILESkg21: https://www.wowhead.com/news/new-upcoming-wow-book-the-dragonflight-codex-coming-june-2023-329308 DAMNIT DAN
[4:13:25] muzicz: Who's considered the overall best MLB player atm (or top 3 I suppose)?
[4:13:27] firehawk73: Honestly, if Judge didnt do the home run record...there a fair argument for Ohtani for MVP
[4:13:32] Frewdicey: Even if Judge did win the Triple Crown, if this was the first time Ohtani did this, he'd still win
[4:13:37] freefella: Guardians youngest team in the league we hungry we will see what happens but i wouldn't dismiss the guardians like that
[4:13:51] Frewdicey: @muzicz 1) Mike Trout 2) Mike Trout 3) Mike Trout
[4:13:59] Animemron: It wouldnt make sense. Khadgar is such an old character, there is absolutely no indication he was a dragon. Hes from way back in WC 2.
[4:14:12] SLoPPYALieN: Little Fish Little Fish Swimming in the Water... come back here and give me my daughter.
[4:14:15] smashwow: @muzicz survival is melee. and isn't even doing what it's doing this season. so probably not a great pick. but pick what you want for fun
[4:14:16] Moobot:  Check out Towelliee's YouTube channel! You can view the most recent uploaded video HERE || Reviewing ALL of the Tier Set Bonuses For Dragonflight youtu.be/qNUM2cxtif0

[4:14:34] Frewdicey: Only 1 can swim upstream, so that makes sense.
[4:14:41] muzicz: Sounds like Mike Trout is decent haha
[4:14:50] sgtstankk: @smashwow does it have a lot of changes going into DF?
[4:14:53] Roaringkittylol: Is windwalker bad/boring ?
[4:14:54] Crafty_plays: @firehawk73 Not discounting Judge as he had an amazing season, but what Ohtani did is much more impressive than what Judge did.
[4:14:56] RuthlessWelshy: what plater is that still the better pixel variant?
[4:15:03] UltraKSlaya: WW is awesome
[4:15:11] smashwow: @sgtstankk i think it's just loosing a lot of the things that make it good in S4
[4:15:20] smashwow: otherwise game play is the same
[4:15:28] muzicz: @smashwow: Yeah I said there was no chance I would play SV

[5:05:50] 91Niki: @googsTV Nobody is forcing you to watch
[5:05:53] TheEndIsNear777: do they have sativa versions? i smoke sativa :(
[5:05:56] muzicz: I have clinical anxiety and I smoked for 10 years or so and as soon as I stopped it got soooo much worse.
[5:06:08] muzicz: Or like a juice or something
[5:06:16] Alienfromger: weed pretzels Kreygasm
[5:06:22] coldhandsbeatz: You can tell is legal there lol
[5:06:23] tedol: market is there, companies will compete for market share
[5:06:45] llNoTToXiCll: @Towelliee  Does your body feel a lot healthier when you started ?
[5:06:51] G1bz: what up man, how you enjoying wrath?
[5:06:52] Aidler: you only need cdb/cbn for sleep
[5:07:23] muzicz: My Psychiatrist is trying to get approval for me to get a prescription for edibles coz atm im on fkn Lexapro
[5:07:28] muzicz: and it sucks balls
[5:07:37] 91Niki: I used to have CBD gummies to help anxiety. But it's just too expensive. And not being able to find any good quality stuff inside EU, just means VAT added on top of the expensive price
[5:07:40] Alchin0: @aidler not necessarily. it depends what's stopping you from sleeping.
[5:07:45] Rulem: still federally illegal in US; as a govt employee, I still can't use it even if its legal in the state
[5:07:46] Aidler: thc is not necessary for sleep
[5:07:48] Kneckt: u can get delta 9 edibles in texas since the dry weight is less than 0.3% of thc but they still fuck you up lol cause they load it in them to give an equal dose like legal states LUL
[5:07:57] Amagon1967: edibles are legal in Arkansas but only for medicinal purposes however this fall there's a bill that's going to be voted on by the public for recreational use so we'll see how that goes
[5:08:03] BigBoxx91: They accidentally legalized edibles here in MN
[5:08:06] TheEndIsNear777: @Rulem didn't biden say something about marijuana recently
[5:08:26] Aidler: @alchin0 of course
[5:08:32] muzicz: indica is useful for sleep, especially when you need to get to bed early.
[5:08:39] Amagon1967: yes it'll pass this year it almost passed 2 years ago so it'll pass
[5:08:44] Zolare: holy shit another Arkansan, never thought this day would happen lmao

[5:08:55] zuna1904: ye it probably helps if you have the start money to do shit like this
[5:08:59] coldhandsbeatz: @theendisnear777 thats about decriminalization. Basically its legal almost everywhere there but there are still ppl in jail for marijuana possesion. So all those people should be free now
[5:09:02] abracka_: @TheEndIsNear777 yes they're pardoning all federal offenses, looking into decriminalization next
[5:09:02] kaihole: @Kneckt I'm in Texas and I've seen weed shops opening more recently, you can get edibles now?

[5:09:44] BlewGamingGroup: guarantee you she got to go on the trip that year
[5:09:50] Kneckt: @kaihole yeah hometownhero has some good ones, made in Austin, litteraly the same dosage/effects as a dispensary edible, its a loophole due to farm bill so they can load as much as they want into them and have the dry weight still be legal
[5:09:57] abracka_: she's going places later in life
[5:09:58] hasan666: GSC is weed
[5:10:03] LeGoogs: @Towelliee Doesnt Peyton have a Busch or Budweiser dispensary and after winning the Superbowl he said he was going to drink a ton and made himself like 15 mill

[6:03:02] smashwow: also +16s give you GV gear of low mythic
[6:03:04] raye_gaming22: and oyu wont get 2400 in 1 week
[6:03:16] muzicz: @WundertueteGER Why/how?
[6:03:26] TompsonX: I don't even get 1500 in current season lol
[6:03:28] raye_gaming22: 415
[6:03:29] TompsonX: I don't like pugging
[6:03:35] smashwow: 415-418 ish
[6:03:40] Updul: 2nd week is possible for me atleast
[6:03:46] smashwow: soul has a spreadsheet on it
[6:03:59] smashwow: you probably won't get 2.4k until about wk3
[6:04:23] smashwow: 1st 2 boss
[6:04:46] smashwow: yup
[6:04:49] 91Niki: Ilvl gear
[6:04:51] duhworks: im not going to lie i kinda hate this new system
[6:04:53] ElmSpace: vault
[6:04:56] smashwow: vault
[6:04:56] raye_gaming22: vaoult
[6:05:04] muzicz: @Towelliee KK I set up your UI, I really likeit , just moved a few things for eye muscle memory timers.
[6:05:06] smashwow: EOD caps at 405
[6:05:09] freefella: The weekly vaults need a rework  with Mythic Plus groups rtoxic.. reddit has had so many posts about this what is the fix
[6:05:34] smashwow: which is dumb, they really need to do something for like first X dungeons of a week you can get up to x ilvl
[6:05:49] smashwow: above a +15
[6:06:04] smashwow: EOD is the only thing i'm really annoyed with
[6:06:07] furrythighs: I like the changes, more incentive to push higher
[6:06:10] mizerboy: Makes mythic raiders feel better
[6:06:12] muzicz: @Towelliee and I had to move my bars for my healing profile
[6:06:26] mavericks312: yea the M+ changes were great changes
[6:06:41] Dieelon: its not going to increase how many people mythic raid, its just going to decrease how many people play m+
[6:06:52] smashwow: ilvl changes
[6:07:00] Shrenko: very good changes
[6:07:06] furrythighs: and people are crying about doing 20"
[6:07:11] Gingerprimer: You are also rewarded for becoming better at M+
[6:07:12] Zucchey: But for sure it will
[6:07:25] duhworks: it went form 10 to 15 to 20
[6:07:27] muzicz: M+ is aids, I just love my 30 man raid team.
[6:07:33] Recording_on_the_grass: it will fall off
[6:07:36] Scoodles91: good look finding a 20 with a non meta class
[6:07:43] Aro725: Sounds overcomplicated, especially each raid difficulty dropping 3 different ilvls
[6:07:47] furrythighs: M+ is fine just have to work at it just like raiding
[6:07:47] freefella: M+ is too min max
[6:07:51] 91Niki: I mean, if people find content too hard, odds are they are setting expectations of themselves too high. Don't aim for content you don't feel you can do.
[6:07:51] loutre_malgache: Do we still get TPs on 20s ?
[6:07:57] mizerboy: In my opinion I think M+ will fall off....hope I am wrong
[6:08:17] potnudel: people that only m+ have the a big problem and allso, if they dont have a team to work, for them it is going too take time.
[6:08:18] Aro725: people also forgetting a 20 in DF is equal to a 23 in SL right now
[6:08:23] raye_gaming22: @Scoodles91 i have 2700 io on a fkn havoc DH buddy if i get into grps you can too
[6:08:26] furrythighs: M+ will be fine
[6:08:30] muzicz: Mythic 35 man team with ins and outs is all I care about
[6:08:33] muzicz: and a bit of PVP
[6:08:34] smashwow: @Aro725 23ish
[6:08:37] abracka_: considering other MMOs are adding their own variants of mythic+ dungeons now, high doubt it falls off
[6:08:40] FatTown: what is a catalst
[6:08:47] Red_Dead_Redeem: I'm super casual and started running just 15's and now I'm item level 300 so mythic plus is not as bad as pple say
[6:08:48] Aro725: @smashwow thats what i said no?
[6:08:50] kalamari__: +15s still gives you a only 14ilvl lower item in the vault. dont understand the fuss. its not a big gap and not really relevant.
[6:08:54] gui2tho: hey what is that WA foir xp bar
[6:08:55] herash_gaming: M+ will be really fine and yeah catalyst comes really late
[6:08:59] raldrik: is it going to do the same thing where it has charges so week 6 we can only make 1 item?
[6:09:09] Updul: inst Tierset not borrowed power?
[6:09:16] furrythighs: i will say the meta plebs really do suck
[6:09:16] WundertueteGER: m+ harder, no borrowed power monkaS
[6:09:21] furrythighs: but any class can do a 20
[6:09:23] muzicz: Is mythic dropping first week? wtf
[6:09:29] Gingerprimer: @FatTown system you can use to get tier from other sources than raids
[6:09:31] smashwow: @Aro725 ish means +/-. they could scale as much as to 25 in SL currently
[6:09:37] freefella: The first few seasons of an expansion seem rough for high keys without min max
[6:09:40] smashwow: or as low as 22
[6:09:41] thegrt13: they still haven't made their m+ post. they could be working on a way for m+ to drop from end of dungeon chests
[6:09:43] Gingerprimer: @Updul yes it is
[6:09:54] potnudel: no yopu are going to hit the Meta wall at lvl 15
[6:10:04] mavericks312: i love that valor is being released on launch
[6:10:07] muzicz: Yeah agreed
[6:10:10] Aro725: @smashwow even worse, people are going to love that
[6:10:11] pereadin: ii think i might only do M+ this next expac
[6:10:15] 91Niki: @Red_Dead_Redeem For sure. Some people just don't have the time to grind it, and then they get upset. Demanding there should be less time consuming content to get that same ilvl. Imo people like that need to lower their expectations of what ilvl they want to reach ijpSHRUG but that's just me
[6:10:16] muzicz: 2100 should be fine
[6:10:17] pereadin: not sure if i'll hhave time to raid
[6:10:23] mizerboy: I hope they keep valor uncapped
[6:10:29] Thoreya: as a main m+ guy, very happy
[6:10:34] freefella: @potnudel So true
[6:10:40] Gingerprimer: I still think we are also getting a vault uppdate with DF
[6:10:42] thegrt13: m
[6:10:55] smashwow: @smashwow yeah. but if we get good stat budgeting it might be ok. some of the keys are waaaaay over tuned even on 10s in beta. so we'll have to see how that all works.
[6:10:56] mavericks312: M+ is in a great place doomsdayers just being doomsdayers
[6:11:04] muzicz: I dont know how you guys can stand mythic plus, unless you only do it with mates of course
[6:11:14] jrobdad: Many whelps, handle it
[6:11:25] smashwow: i really hope they address that RNG from the vault. they probably won't. they love that slot machine
[6:11:25] Zivs: combat in this game is just fun @muzicz
[6:11:33] Red_Dead_Redeem: @91Niki yeah I agree, but that's the whole "you can't please everyone" kind of thing but blizz tends to listen to the pple demanding things a little too much imo
[6:11:34] Aidler: @muzicz very true
[6:11:34] raye_gaming22: 16s

[6:11:35] muzicz: Yeah almost exactly that
[6:11:47] smashwow: no way
[6:11:49] Updul: the deterministic great vault
[6:11:52] Alacod: it says 16\
[6:11:55] Thoreya: @muzicz its very fun to blast, and doesnt need such coordination. 5 player content >
[6:11:57] raye_gaming22: 2100 16s 2400 20s
[6:12:00] muzicz: 16s 2500
[6:12:01] thegrt13: @mizerboy valor will most like not be uncapped at launch. and it shouldn't be
[6:12:01] Gingerprimer: Yeah something that limits your badluck with the vault
[6:12:03] 91Niki: I stopped doing m+ for Shadowlands because of lack of gear drops. I did not feel like spending hours doing m+ for 1 piece of gear at reset. If that has changed in DF then I am all for tackling m+ again
[6:12:05] smashwow: that's not what that char said
[6:12:08] freefella: People selling high keys isn't good for the game imo
[6:12:13] thegrt13: yes
[6:12:21] muzicz: @Thoreya Yeah broi
[6:12:24] Red_Dead_Redeem: so mythic dungeons will drop the first week of prepatch or is it just a "for when it comes out" talk
[6:12:25] smashwow: that ilvl chart was for valor cap on ilvl of gear
[6:12:31] Thoreya: i cba raiding anymore
[6:12:42] muzicz: Really!?
[6:12:43] smashwow: what chart @Towelliee
[6:12:51] muzicz: damn that seems lower than I woulda guessed
[6:12:52] Red_Dead_Redeem: 2400 io score?
[6:12:53] smashwow: if you're looking at the ilvl gear chart that's not io
[6:13:00] Red_Dead_Redeem: ohhhh valor
[6:13:02] Demanisraar: https://www.wowhead.com/news/shadowlands-season-4-ending-on-october-25th-329311 @Towelliee
[6:13:05] smashwow: yeah that's not the IO for the gear @Towelliee
[6:13:07] Gingerprimer: @Red_Dead_Redeem mythic dungeons come out with start of the expansion
[6:13:09] 91Niki: @Red_Dead_Redeem Yeah for sure. I am personally in the boat that I don't really care whether casuals have access to mythic ilvl gear through time gated grind. Most groups don't invite based on ilvl anymore anyway. It's all scores and achievements
[6:13:10] WundertueteGER: 2400 for 415 item
[6:13:14] Demanisraar: ah ok
[6:13:15] carbonstylus: its says on the top KEKW
[6:13:27] smashwow: 2.4k will be 18s and 19s
[6:13:30] strike879: imo they shouldve only done like half the changes they did the dungeon ilvl going higher is good the increased % per lvl bad higher cap needed for vault bad higher ilvl for raid good (even if i cant raid myself)
[6:13:33] smashwow: 2.5k is all 20s

[6:13:34] muzicz: 2500 to be safe imo
[6:13:40] Red_Dead_Redeem: @Gingerprimer thxs <3
[6:13:45] raye_gaming22: na 2500 is 19/20s
[6:13:53] raye_gaming22: 2100 are 16s
[6:14:02] smashwow: omg that's not the M+ score chart LUL
[6:14:06] Gingerprimer: @Red_Dead_Redeem M+ comes out on the season start with the raid tho
[6:14:09] smashwow: that's ilvl for gear
[6:14:15] mizerboy: Dumb question, is KSM changing?
[6:14:16] flebbooo: i fuck with these changes
[6:14:23] Thoreya: so we should gear up alts in m+ before season ends if we plan to gear chars?
[6:14:25] muzicz: Im raiding mythic asap, so I have to do this anyway
[6:14:25] Thoreya: for DF
[6:14:27] Updul: OR u Order some crafted mythic gear
[6:14:33] Gingerprimer: @mizerboy not known yet
[6:14:37] ijuki: There is no m+ limit like the past raid tiers?
[6:14:38] freefella: Professions and AH should be where Gold is at not Key selling
[6:14:49] soth_klf: Any Prot Paladin tips for Dragonflight?
[6:14:51] smashwow: if you all think you're getting 2.4k from 16s you're going to be very disappointed when they post the score charts
[6:14:54] 91Niki: I just really hope more gear drops in general. Shadowlands doing +10 dungeons and having zero gear drop for you was just ... hell
[6:14:57] Aidler: count me out. I‘m not doing any M(+)
[6:14:59] Gingerprimer: Nah selling in game services for gold is fine/good for the game
[6:15:06] muzicz: Plus I need to do this on 3 toons
[6:15:18] Red_Dead_Redeem: @91Niki yeah idk it's crazy with how much pple rely on the IO score when a lot of them have been carried, like I been in many a mythic + where the person has a great IO score but knows nothing about mechanics LUL
[6:15:25] Rottencoarse: oh yeah sloot was a doomer
[6:15:42] freefella: I saw a multi character bot i thought they were banned?
[6:15:42] Moobot: I will be leveling a toon on the NA Fresh Server Maladath (Normal) 8/30. 3-4 Day Mini-Thon for Launch. Gonna hit Max Level and get some quick gear!
[6:15:43] WundertueteGER: booster prices going up atleast twice the price of the current
[6:15:56] ijuki: @Red_Dead_Redeem Ain't got time for mechanics, just pew pew pew Kappa
[6:15:56] rapheeki93: hey chat, looking to try tanking for the first time in DF to mix things up, havent played in a long time though, whats a good class recommendation?
[6:15:59] Recording_on_the_grass: its like blizzard encouraging boosters
[6:16:03] smashwow: they've been selling 20s for awhile. the slow down was blizzard killing the boosting communities
[6:16:10] strike879: imo they need titan residuum back
[6:16:11] Gragnar: so you need 2400 IO, which is 20something to upgrade items to level 16-17. doesn't make much sense
[6:16:12] muzicz: lol
[6:16:19] Red_Dead_Redeem: hell with me working I'll go for the boosted IO score ain't gonna lie LUL

[6:16:33] 91Niki: @Red_Dead_Redeem Yeah for sure that too. I've both been a mythic prog player, and now I am uber casual. I've seen both sides of the coin. As long as gear actually drops and I don't have to grind 20 dungeons before I see a single piece of loot, I am happy LUL
[6:16:41] smashwow: @Gragnar averaged to 19s on M+ with current score scaling
[6:16:44] matthewkshearer: yo man grounded is so good
[6:16:45] muzicz: I gotta do it on a fire mage/holy pally/monk tank
[6:16:46] Gingerprimer: @Simplicityfails guardian is easy but might be boring DK/DH are also fun esp DK since they are often self substaible if your healer is not the goat
[6:16:51] zeeAbe: Bob, whatchu doin?! BOB IT IS PREPATCH PRE-PREPARATION TIME. BOB PLS
[6:16:53] smashwow: but your'e going to do 20s anyways
[6:17:09] MILESkg21: woofer towOny
[6:17:10] Red_Dead_Redeem: I've never paid for a boosted run tho so idk how that even works, I imagine you would have to do some work
[6:17:14] Featherbow: towOny towOny towOny towOny
[6:17:15] 91Niki: share the food hooman towOny
[6:17:22] Shamwise: towOny
[6:17:32] muzicz: I can max my prot pally too
[6:17:41] Aidler: Blizz isn‘t actively encouraging boosting but it’s a result of their faulty strategy for DF
[6:17:41] thebakeriscomingforu: they'll probably split it more to 3 tanks
[6:17:44] muzicz: and gear my frost mage for pvp
[6:18:06] Red_Dead_Redeem: World first is whole other animal
[6:18:07] WundertueteGER: you can probably skip bear as world first raider KEKW
[6:18:09] armoredmonky: atleast there is no torghast
[6:18:13] smashwow: @Red_Dead_Redeem  nope you can just go and die. most boosters prefer that. we use to require the boostee to die so we didn't have to worry about mechanics getting hosed.
[6:18:25] 91Niki: You don't just need to love the game, you need to have a absurd amount of patience LUL

[6:18:32] outbreak2005: And geared keep in mind
[6:18:34] freefella: @smashwow how is blizz dealing with keyselling boosters?
[6:18:54] Garguk: who is leaving what?
[6:18:54] muzicz: So. Fire mage/Frost PVP/Holy Pally/Prot Pally/Monk Tank
[6:18:58] Gingerprimer: @freefella they are not
[6:19:03] smashwow: @freefella as long as it's same server and the advert is in the sell group it's all legit
[6:19:05] Red_Dead_Redeem: @smashwow really? wow that is interesting, so you go in and die and boom instant boosted IO score...that does make sense
[6:19:05] RhadigarTV: Hello? Dominos?
[6:19:07] Mecabeast: needing all 6 tanks geared for 6 sell runs a week or more
[6:19:18] 91Niki: @RhadigarTV ijpHI
[6:19:21] smashwow: @Red_Dead_Redeem basically
[6:19:25] muzicz: Luckily I just took long term leave
[6:19:31] muzicz: coz fuck.
[6:19:38] smashwow: and all the gear from the run typically depending on where you are in the season
[6:19:54] RhadigarTV: @91Niki  Why hello there
[6:20:00] Red_Dead_Redeem: idk I'm a sicko I like grinding content and working for the IO score, gear and such
[6:20:08] Aidler: Well, then the initial content of DF will be done very quickly for me.
[6:20:18] Gingerprimer: DF is trying to go back to the core play the game get gear play harder of the game
[6:20:25] raldrik: im ready for him to retire from world first

[6:20:40] Red_Dead_Redeem: yeah I can imagine world first is a lot of pressure
[6:20:44] 91Niki: I'm not gonna pre order and sub until the weekend before pre patch. I get burnt out too quick otherwise
[6:20:54] freefella: FOMO feeling of missing out
[6:21:04] muzicz: I base everything I do mage wise on Firedup & get depressed every time I cant match up.
[6:21:08] Red_Dead_Redeem: @91Niki same
[6:21:18] Gingerprimer: @91Niki might even be a smart plan to sub few days after the patch
[6:21:31] c0mmander_starscream: Otherwise know as "Race to World's Meme"
[6:21:35] smashwow: RWF is 1 and 2 fighting for 1st and 2-4 fighting to get on the 1-2 rooster @Towelliee
[6:21:36] 91Niki: @Gingerprimer Nah, I wanna get my toons ready. Get rid of junk. What not.
[6:21:45] georgymack: Yo mate, whats your opinion on guardian druid and lack of communication from devs?
[6:22:01] smashwow: it could go as low as 10
[6:22:06] Gingerprimer: @91Niki ah true b
[6:22:15] muzicz: It is mentally detrimental. They know that and they take time off after the insane grind
[6:22:17] xachilles420: is the 25.10 offical announced?
[6:22:23] c0mmander_starscream: Race to worlds 1st It must affect divorce rates and unemployment
[6:22:28] MILESkg21: Season 4 ends on the 25th so yeah
[6:22:28] WundertueteGER: KEKW
[6:22:30] Red_Dead_Redeem: Yeah it takes an intense amount of dedication and you have to have a certain mentality to endure all the stuff for world first, my respect to those pple
[6:22:31] smashwow: LUL
[6:22:34] Kulture1: would be cool if one of those guilds did actually contend with the top 2
[6:22:37] flebbooo: KEKW yeep
[6:22:47] 91Niki: @Gingerprimer Plus I got names I wanna take if freed up on pre patch day :p
[6:22:47] smashwow: bear shits in the woods. message received. Kappa
[6:22:48] Mbakley78: who cares who gets world first I could care less people make a big stink out of it at the end of the day it means nothing
[6:22:52] soth_klf: guadians long for Legion Classic LUL
[6:23:06] muzicz: I was in a top 500 guild back in Cata & it took up my entire life.
[6:23:11] WundertueteGER: they probably looked at guardians and said fuck that spec KEKW
[6:23:13] Kaydwen: So pre patch confirmed 25th huh
[6:23:24] Gingerprimer: @91Niki you can just save them on a trial tho
[6:23:31] Red_Dead_Redeem: so am I right in assuming Evoker class is kaka atm?
[6:23:31] 91Niki: @Kaydwen The season ends that day, so yes
[6:23:56] 91Niki: @Gingerprimer That is true. but yeah, I also just wanna get toons ready. Tidy up banks. You name it
[6:23:56] Snabido: DW and Rag was nasty to prog
[6:23:59] Kulture1: 25 of oct?
[6:24:00] Gingerprimer: I also do not think Bears feels that bad tbh
[6:24:05] Red_Dead_Redeem: my poor ret pally going to go into prepatch LUL
[6:24:13] smashwow: i feel like spine was worse
[6:24:15] Jayros990: The music is wrath is still some of the best in game music ever to come out
[6:24:19] muzicz: Early Cata was pretty hard if you remember. And dragon soul took like 9 months to fuck off.
[6:24:58] Red_Dead_Redeem: are you tanking this dungeon? @Towelliee
[6:25:01] Mockle: what tank is good atm in DF?
[6:25:16] soth_klf: @Towelliee throughout all of WoW, which Tank was your most favorite to play as?
[6:25:28] Gingerprimer: @Mockle warriors are greta but also it is beta and they are still tuning stuff
[6:25:38] MILESkg21: only 13 LuL
[6:25:44] Red_Dead_Redeem: so it's better to have a two hander as a DK tank then to have a two handed bc of the attack time to generate threat?
[6:25:45] muzicz: Dragon Soul was "dragon soul draining".
[6:26:03] Red_Dead_Redeem: *one hander
[6:26:17] bad_fish_too: Trash lock
[6:26:19] Mockle: @Gingerprimer wow possibly a warrior comeback, hopefully it stays that way :D
[6:26:59] Red_Dead_Redeem: holy hell over 15 builds
[6:27:15] muzicz: I love the UI Towel, but I had to change a few things for bars for healing and timers.

[6:34:33] Flippyyz: cant wait to what Rextroy does with prot pally in DF
[6:34:33] Mbakley78: just make everything OP and good to go

[6:34:49] Red_Dead_Redeem: oh for sure they will have a big patch to address the issues
[6:35:16] Tiamarilien: I played prot pally through SL was thinking about going back to BDK forDF. I'm still leveling it on beta and it's going alright, but I haven't heard many ppl talking about it in conversations about tanking?
[6:35:22] Menion01: Day 1 untested patch. What could go wrong?!
[6:35:24] MILESkg21: they have til Launch day Kappa
[6:35:46] james_bah: everything will be fixed in 2 weeks for prepatch dont worry

[6:36:54] Shrenko: I feel bad for the balancing team
[6:37:02] warrenny: I, mean sl ones
[6:37:20] 91Niki: The legendary in DF will probably be a legendary dragon for dragon flying Kappa
[6:37:28] abracka_: i think we would be happy to see the return of progression legendaries, similar to MoP
[6:37:35] muzicz: Actually good question, what mod and tank do you have Towel?

[6:38:16] abracka_: diablo-esque legendaries are kinda annoying and ruin the immersion for me
[6:38:18] smashwow: give me good tier sets and good talents
[6:38:22] Molvonos: Yea, Antorus
[6:38:37] Mockle: hated shadowlands legendarys... for me it was just a massiv gold sink
[6:38:43] cahoots82: @abracka_ What kind of immersion you getting in retail lately?
[6:38:46] muzicz: I dont know if you remember this but the H Zods Repeating bow took me 55 attempts to get. I still dream about the depression.
[6:38:47] 91Niki: I mean I wasn't a fan of the legendaries after the cloak. But it was the effects of them I didn't like. I like the system of getting them
[6:39:09] Nokterian: Legion legendarys sucked because you never knew what you could get it was gambling
[6:39:10] muzicz: And DBM 95 times
[6:39:36] Nokterian: true
[6:39:43] Snabido: What you mean, you didn't like getting legendaries from Blingtron
[6:39:44] ZealotryTV: 7.0 sephuz :)
[6:39:45] muzicz: Cause with DBM meant I could switch my gems from agi to armor pen
[6:39:46] smashwow: lol prydaz
[6:39:48] HaxzorJimDuggan: that fucking neck haunts my dreams
[6:39:48] MaximumSerg: chypuz
[6:39:49] Morpheusx25: opus neck lol
[6:39:50] Fluisterwoud: Still remember the first leggo i got from Legion. That golden dragon in your screen, woahh.
[6:39:52] 91Niki: HYPERS LEGGO DROP ...... worst leggo PepeHands
[6:39:59] Nokterian: Prydaz! towSweat
[6:39:59] abracka_: never forget you getting heathcliff's immortality from maw of souls with that bug that didn't let you loot in the chest
[6:40:02] MILESkg21: that was my first LuL
[6:40:05] falldrgn: yeah.. raid spots determined by how much AP you could farm.. and what legos you got
[6:40:11] Aidler: I know why they need  rng but it’s also a menace
[6:40:14] bobballsack1991: worse legendary was in shaddowlands crucible grinding
[6:40:19] TheFox0228: I don't need to. It's literally the only leg i got all of legion on my Warlock main Sadge
[6:40:19] feherlofia123: is prepatch  25th confirmed
[6:40:20] abracka_: DK AoE aggro is garbage
[6:40:20] chukudu: got the speed plate boots on my paladin as first legendary LUL
[6:40:21] ZealotryTV: I actually had a buddy who got prydaz first and then got sephuz and quit KWK
[6:40:24] ZealotryTV: KEKW
[6:40:26] Nokterian: I do was lucky i got my luffa's after 3 times on my druid LUL
[6:40:27] Almex: u sure that prepatch is 25 oct? :) they kinda just said end of season might be the week after?
[6:40:31] Katariatv: At the end i had all of Them for druid
[6:40:39] Damuffin14: are they keeping legendaries in for DF?
[6:40:43] Fluisterwoud: I loved sephuz
[6:40:44] muzicz: @ZealotryTV I dont like your mate :P
[6:40:44] Snabido: Found myself speccing into Morbidity for reduced dnd
[6:40:46] 91Niki: Yeah legendaries in Shadowlands are by far the least favorite system for legandaries. For me at least
[6:40:50] Artenuous: i got sephyuz first leggo as warrior :)
[6:40:50] freefella: Heroics and all the raids in wotlk are all mechanics i hope blizz learns from the positivity from community
[6:40:51] cahoots82: Do you not get D&D in blood?
[6:40:52] Arabus135: How long have u been raiding on illidan?
[6:40:53] vic_ave: unholy dk or enhance shaman for wrath?
[6:40:53] Nokterian: no more leggos in DF
[6:40:55] Mecabeast: probably better once you have 26 expertise and 8% hit
[6:41:02] jeflag: yeah sephuz became bis for m+ for a lot of classes
[6:41:11] strike879: maybe in a later patch
[6:41:13] mozavich: @cahoots82 you do
[6:41:20] muzicz: I got DBM on my 30th kill and it got taken by a DK :S
[6:41:38] reggiepowa: wrathion is around so maybe another legendary cloak?
[6:41:42] bobballsack1991: why don't they make legendary actually legendary and hard to get
[6:41:50] muzicz: DBW***
[6:41:52] Nokterian: Oh sure i can see a legendary like they did in BFA with the cloak

[6:42:37] smashwow: i mean it's kinda cool, until that stat increase fucks with timers and spell queueing like it always does.
[6:42:52] 91Niki: @muzicz Yeah I had Gattz fix it ;)
[6:43:12] muzicz: He didnt have the retail UI in it
[6:43:18] 91Niki: @Towelliee I had Gattz fix and dumb down the UI command. Smaller links and added retail UI link too

[6:44:01] 91Niki: @muzicz Hahaha I did nothing besides yelling at my bf to fix it :p
[6:44:24] muzicz: Oh, wd Gattz whoever that is :P
[6:44:25] Sollice: @muzicz Going to have to get a new package for DF UI I would imagine. Skyliner doesnt do much anymore
[6:44:31] Sollice: Unless maybe we ask him
[6:44:38] smashwow: @smashwow and in those examples it's actively making farm harder. there were guilds that couldn't even reclear those bosses because of the ilvl increase etc.
[6:44:46] Quantz89: I feel like an idiot for asking, but what's the name of the xp bar addon Towel uses ?

[6:49:46] smashwow: sometimes you get an upgrade, sometimes you don't
[6:49:51] muzicz: Always jelly of my Main tank
[6:50:03] mozavich: @Snabido depends on what you're talking about. sunwell gear > wrath leveling greens/blues

[6:52:34] Skyllash: Im so confused, is classic and WotLK 2 seperate games? I thought they just updated classic to Wrath like in the past
[6:52:35] muzicz: Ive always wanted a druid but it terrifies me to essentially learn 4 classes again,
[6:53:14] KyleEverett: nah, classic vanilla servers are still there
[6:53:15] Bestbud: feral always does well at the start until like 3-4 weeks in, and then towards the end. Just the way of the cat FeelsBadMan
[6:53:24] 91Niki: They gut us like cattle if we ain't looking towSweat
[6:53:40] muzicz: bugded recal servers
[6:53:59] exbuddha: How do you like dragonflight so far Towelliee?
[6:54:01] KyleEverett: classic is a forever locked vanilla in naxx phase, and then there's season of mastery which I guess flopped a bit
[6:54:02] Molvonos: @91Niki Real ferals play horde, so that makes sense.
[6:54:17] myfunkyself: LUL
[6:54:27] muzicz: Boomys were double second place last time I checked
[6:54:28] 91Niki: Yeah but the difference is, Blizzard looks the other way when Boomy does good. BUT when feral does good they rush to nerf us like a fucking fire is going
[6:54:58] 91Niki: @91Niki kek
[6:55:03] 91Niki: :p
[6:55:09] muzicz: haha
[6:55:17] N3llee: noah som died pretty quick
[6:55:18] Mashiiro98: season of mastery died quickly, only a handful of guilds in the end, less than 400 total raiders
[6:55:33] N3llee: i think onlyt 4 guilds cleared naxx on the hardest som setting
[6:55:37] EKS90_: season ending on the 25th, that is nice @Towelliee
[6:55:50] muzicz: Nax is easy af :S
[6:55:56] mavericks312: but i thiught candies liked hard shit
[6:56:04] Mashiiro98: people just didnt hit max level, it was too grindy right after tbc had JUST released
[6:56:05] N3llee: som had some interesting things.. but no one played it
[6:56:19] muzicz: Oh I see.
[6:56:21] JRobezzz: I'm really excited for DF pre-patch. Do you think players will come back to retail, or stay on Wrath?
[6:56:23] Mecabeast: tabard for killing kt without dying was just tabard of frost lol
[6:56:24] Fugazi811: som was interesting but the farming for mats was insane
[6:56:47] D3m0nHunt3r666: basically SOM got bullied by the other versions of classic, only at launch had some promise.
[6:56:52] muzicz: I fell asleep once raiding Nax back when it came out

[6:57:29] N3llee: turns out no one likes vanilla with out world buffs
[6:57:33] D3m0nHunt3r666: yeah
[6:57:41] Shurn_82: half the guild I was in left to go to retail content lol
[6:57:43] drowninmystyrofoam: Is SoM still up?
[6:57:56] muzicz: I started playing in Wrath so Im in the dark on sunwell and before etc
[6:57:59] gwildorr_: why camera so dark? or is it just me?
[6:58:07] KyleEverett: You know, the only reason I want cata classic is so I can do the Gnomeregan and Echo Isles reclamation quests
[6:58:09] BlewGamingGroup: som failed due to having to farm consumables 8+ hours a day
[6:58:10] Fugazi811: thought they were gonna allow som toons to transfer to wotlk?
[6:58:26] 91Niki: Towelliee is a vampire. The light burns
[6:58:31] KyleEverett: Gnome Kazoo war music is so good
[6:58:36] muzicz: LOL
[6:58:46] TotallyNotRaien: classic would be cooler if they let unlocks carry over to retail
[6:58:48] muzicz: I have the same problem when I have to drive to work
[6:58:52] Fugazi811: yes
[6:58:58] MILESkg21: no way LuL
[6:59:02] Molvonos: #nochanges?
[6:59:07] mavericks312: but candies like things difficult i thought
[6:59:25] Mecabeast: think alot of people went hard-core and started over if they died
[6:59:27] EKS90_: classic overall have this big consume grind, and they did it in normal classic and then had to do it again with SoM  which made people not wanting to repeat it, so people quit @Towelliee
[6:59:29] muzicz: Yeah, lots of meeting and stratting etc
[6:59:34] ScalarGaming: ScalarGaming subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 86 months! 
[6:59:35] N3llee: yea but in vanilla you stack 15 kinds of consumes
[6:59:38] FriskyTV: prepatch get announced?
[6:59:38] muzicz: months of it
[6:59:42] N3llee: retail its what two?
[6:59:46] N3llee: maybe 3
[6:59:54] CapsuleCorpEmployee: I assume candies are classic andys? lmao
[6:59:55] MILESkg21: pre ptach is the 25th :)
[6:59:55] Shurn_82: the problem I had on our server ( the one you played on tow) is that the economy was ran by 2 guilds on horde ( our server pop was almost non-existant)
[7:00:00] MILESkg21: patch*
[7:00:01] 91Niki: @FriskyTV Technically no. But season ends on the 25th. Which = pre patch
[7:00:06] DeathLyst: cause in classic you get banned for buying gold and in retail thats how you gear for raids
[7:00:16] EKS90_: @MilesKG21 wouldn't say to hard, to time consuming to refarm all the consumes u just spent 2 years farming to just do it all again, is my thinking about it ^^
[7:00:17] Fugazi811: @CapsuleCorpEmployee yea candy's and randy's lol
[7:00:22] muzicz: Echo have 4 weekly meetings with the whole 35 man team
[7:00:41] MetalJoshP: @deathlyst facts
[7:00:52] feherlofia123: @deathlyst u can trade retail gold for classic gold its not tos
[7:01:12] KyleEverett: I'm taking a huge gamble that slimecat is still available in prepatch
[7:01:20] MILESkg21: how do you get Reatil gold to Classic server LuL

[7:02:04] Moobot: Towelliee will be playing WOTLK Classic on the Fresh server Maladath.
[7:02:12] EKS90_: @MilesKG21 you give someone retail gold and they buy gold for classic and then they trade you it in classic LUL , that is how they did it in classic launch.
[7:02:20] volkreig: @Towelliee global release is needed if you ask me
[7:02:27] EKS90_: you essentially pay a middle man
[7:02:43] Aidler: definitely…. Liquid is always much faster in the beginning and Echo needs time to cache up
[7:02:58] Mecabeast: how many days into the race till they actually start mythic prob one or 2 bc splits right?
[7:03:12] muzicz: Max kinda doesnt raid now
[7:03:35] TotallyNotRaien: theres plenty of good players who cant be bothered
[7:03:36] muzicz: He just communicates everything, but I get your point.
[7:03:40] nocturnal_2195: @mileskg21 there is a wow community  discord that I use basically  trade gold from retail from one of the traders from the discord and they then trade you what the retail gold is worth in classic if that makes any sense  LUL
[7:04:03] LeGoogs: I know a dude who is insane at the game but hes a doctor with his own practice. No way hed even bother grinding that hard.
[7:04:10] abracka_: @insanity2195 you got a server link for that? my DMs are open

[7:06:13] DeathLyst: until you can buy real life money with some higher currency, selling currency in games for real money will always suck ;p
[7:06:21] gurunoni: Damn I got hit with it. @Aidler @djdavecee

[7:09:52] Kneckt: technically just giving ur gold away on each realm no rule breaking there
[7:09:57] DeathLyst: paying for a sub to pay to skip time farming gold to get an item you want
[7:09:58] muzicz: So twitch subs acting as a middle man for currency then?
[7:10:02] Lenietwitch: @DeathLyst you think they do it for love and ponies ?
[7:10:02] PanoramicPanda: I once thought about making a Insurance guild that performed taxi, rez, and heal services for gold XD
[7:10:13] nocturnal_2195: @towelliee  just type wow market discord on your pc it's the first one
[7:10:19] DeathLyst: @leniewashere they boat sailed years ago

[7:23:57] 91Niki: Lets still be respectful guys
[7:24:15] Treehop: I was there when it happened.  The girl doing the announcing had no idea how bad it was and kept making jokes.
[7:24:23] NerdyTeK: @bloodogg35 and that matters why? they event was to push off the platform ... imaginee if sum1 cracked ther head
[7:24:27] LaShane15: @91Niki thanks!

[7:25:09] 91Niki: Porn star doesn't equal you can be disrespectful and objectify them. So be respectful thank you
[7:25:32] bloodogg35: me personally i would of checked the mats and stuff before  volunteering to get pushed off
[7:25:43] jkitchin75: qhats her name asking for a mate
[7:25:46] EKS90_: she is succesfull on twitch aswell, who cares if she is also in the sexwork industry, let people do the work they wanna do.
[7:25:48] piratechris: No what is funny is how to you eff up a foam pit that bad.. I mean c'mon
[7:25:59] dinomiyte: i stil dont know what yall are talking about lol
[7:26:00] MILESkg21: they're def gettin sued for this
[7:26:04] NerdyTeK: @bloodogg35 billion dollar company ... they dont have enough time
[7:26:34] bloodogg35: but yea the event organizers  are also at fault for not having propper protextion
[7:26:35] NerdyTeK: 2in foam on top of solic concrete SeemsGood
[7:26:41] bloodogg35: protection
[7:26:55] 91Niki: If they would have shut down the place after the first person got hurt, that is one thing. But the fact they kept it open without a care in the world. I hope she sues them
[7:27:17] NerdyTeK: this isnt the first tim tc got fucked
[7:27:18] bloodogg35: on that yea i hope she does also
[7:27:36] TheItalianStallion321: from what i read, the security kept saying she was fine and tried to get her to move. according to a report. an offduty EMT told them to not move her until real medical staff came
[7:27:38] nocturnal_2195: @towelliee  I don't know if you saw my message earlier  but hers the discord linkhttps://discord.gg/wowmarket I don't want to keep spamming the link
[7:27:40] mavericks312: not suprising they are on sale atm tbh lol
[7:27:46] mozavich: @91Niki true, not only that but that pit had to have failed all the safety tests for sure, right? 1 layer of foam then solid concrete?
[7:28:00] 91Niki: @TheItalianStallion321 Oh yeah, they could end up her getting more hurt by moving her
[7:28:00] Shurn_82: @91Niki i wondered about that too...usually that stuff gets shut down fast
[7:28:24] AllenzoTV: KEKW
[7:28:25] Fugazi811: that pit was totally unsafe watching both people get hurt
[7:28:25] SlashSlashy: lmao
[7:28:30] MILESkg21: oof KEKW
[7:28:30] EKS90_: "just get out of the pit"
[7:28:36] NerdyTeK: if you die you get banned for 30days
[7:28:38] AllenzoTV: move it along KEKW
[7:28:44] Tuck321: chat will the xp buff continue during pre patch?
[7:28:46] 91Niki: Bro, she could've ended up paralyzed from being moved and shit...
[7:28:50] Karn1987: @Towelliee  i just popped over to Bajheera's to say hi cus im subed to him to
[7:28:50] EKS90_: for 2 days...... @Towelliee
[7:28:50] N3llee: yes
[7:28:56] N3llee: and someone else got her berfore
[7:28:58] Fugazi811: another woman dislocated her knee
[7:29:00] allisonkielle: woulda stopped that shit for sure
[7:29:03] N3llee: hurt*
[7:29:10] nocturnal_2195: I want to know how the fuck can you fuck up a foam pit to that extent
[7:29:12] Bernardo994: OMG poor girl. just watched it she bounced
[7:29:16] TacDuc: @Tuck321 Nope, but when prepatch comes it's a 61% reduction from 1-60
[7:29:16] LtDanAndHisMagicLegs: Nope, they continued on and were handing out laptops like it's all good
[7:29:22] Bernardo994: in 2 places
[7:29:26] EKS90_: they kept it open untill sunday @Towelliee  when like 3 people have gotten hurt.
[7:29:29] Kinghorn: there was no foam
[7:29:31] Kinghorn: LUL
[7:29:31] jkitchin75: dame it was Adriana Chechik
[7:29:32] AllenzoTV: thats dumb af
[7:29:33] NerdyTeK: i have pillow that are better
[7:29:35] MILESkg21: talk about half assed
[7:29:41] 91Niki: It was like what ... 1 foot foam?
[7:29:42] Tuck321: @tacduc thx
[7:29:52] TheItalianStallion321: those foam boulders were bullshit, id rather jump into a pool of balls like when we were kids
[7:29:55] AllenzoTV: she really jumped up high too, straight on the bone
[7:29:55] LtDanAndHisMagicLegs: @91Niki If that
[7:29:57] NerdyTeK: they lucky no1 fell and hit head
[7:30:01] Austei: ecw ballpit jeeze
[7:30:02] Bernardo994: nah that's the rest if her life
[7:30:06] Arabus135: you have to admire her determination to blow out her back
[7:30:07] LtDanAndHisMagicLegs: It was like 1 layer of foam over concrete
[7:30:10] Bernardo994: of*
[7:30:16] Bernardo994: yes
[7:30:17] N3llee: doesnt matter.. as an attorney you go after everyone... cast a wide net and cash in.
[7:30:21] NerdyTeK: its blizz fault sum how
[7:30:27] Bernardo994: there will
[7:30:27] LeDerpski: I heard a 3rd party set up the pit but idk the truth in that
[7:30:36] 91Niki: Someone just needs to get the fuck up and take responsibility. Be a god damn grownup
[7:30:42] gurunoni: LUL
[7:30:44] TheItalianStallion321: even if she wasnt a pornstar, imagine sitting in a chair trying to stream even after the 1 year? it wont be easy
[7:30:54] TheItalianStallion321: 1 year of recovery
[7:31:14] LtDanAndHisMagicLegs: I think how they handled it *afterwards* is the drama
[7:31:16] AllenzoTV: the money she gets still wont matter cause shes gonna deal w/ that forever
[7:31:16] N3llee: The drama was the twitch security and lack of.
[7:31:17] mozavich: @TheItalianStallion321 life changing, for sure
[7:31:20] BlewGamingGroup: lenovo will get the lawsuit and they will in turn go after the manufacturer of the pit if the amount of foam in the pit was their recommended amount to be "Safe for use"
[7:31:26] 91Niki: @AllenzoTV This
[7:31:33] NerdyTeK: lucky she aint paralyzed
[7:31:35] bloodogg35: from what hear there was more irl streamers then gamers so wow would bbe safe
[7:31:38] BlewGamingGroup: shit rolls down hill
[7:31:39] Shurn_82: back injuries are life changing...I was supposed to be military...now im an electrician
[7:31:42] N3llee: Having female creators getting lick in the face and groupped by male fans should not happen
[7:31:43] EKS90_: twitchcon was a shitshow overall, the foampit, open visible alcohol to just "grab n go" easy to drug etc, it was all very badly organized.  @Towelliee
[7:31:48] Sollice: @roadrrunnerr1 You can not go over a foam manufacturer for someone not using enough of it
[7:32:09] MILESkg21: the open drink shit will never end
[7:32:09] NerdyTeK: TC has been messd up for like 4yrs now
[7:32:18] 91Niki: Yikes
[7:32:18] Snabido: Twitchcon seemed okayish in the beginning. Now? 🤔
[7:32:18] Shurn_82: @roadrrunnerr1 exactly, unfortunately the installation company would be liable
[7:32:19] Sollice: And Lenovo is likly just the sponsor. The liklihood this is 100% on Twitch and/or the company they hired to set it up
[7:32:25] EKS90_: Have read about like3-4 people getting drugged this year alone.

[7:33:23] xADOMIZEDx: adrianna did after that check comes through
[7:33:25] Kneckt: the lawyers of the people who broke shit
[7:33:27] Jayros990: the chick that broke her back won
[7:33:28] mavericks312: damn dansby swanson with 3 k's today
[7:33:28] Shurn_82: i saw hassan and someone else jousting
[7:33:32] EKS90_: @91Niki tons of stories on twitter about people not being allowed to bring a plus one to the after parties, open alcohol, 3-4 stories about people getting drugged, etc etc, it was so bad this year.
[7:33:34] 91Niki: The sad thing for her is, if she sues, odds are twitch is gonna be that lame kid who goes "well then you can't use our platform anymore BabyRage "
[7:33:36] N3llee: wouldnt worry any half ass good attorney will get everyone ... or narrow it down to those responsible. events like that has a large paper trail
[7:33:52] NerdyTeK: @91Niki true...
[7:33:55] 91Niki: @91Niki Oof
[7:33:59] Mourningztar: Safe
[7:33:59] Kneckt: doing some back breakin grindin
[7:34:08] Molvonos: @91Niki and then she'd sue Twitch, lol.
[7:34:20] Kneckt: she can just goto youtube Kappa
[7:34:23] 91Niki: True
[7:34:24] abracka_: "time to hitup youtube"
[7:34:25] GordoHippo: oh snap they announced prepatch date
[7:34:30] EKS90_: She has onlyfans, her pornhub, she can stream on youtube, she will get the settlement money, she will be set anyway.
[7:34:36] Shurn_82: yea twich is doing a lot of questionable stuff so i do see that @91Niki
[7:34:37] BlewGamingGroup: they cant take her off the platform for a lawsuit .. that would be another lawsuit in itself
[7:34:40] MILESkg21: its the 25th
[7:34:42] Kneckt: i dont see it
[7:34:56] angrywowplayer1337: So I just made a bunch of people on an RP server mad. There was a bunch of belts doing weirdo story time stuff in SW so I rode in circles on a mechanohog around then spamming a macro yell “lmao your tree is ashes lmao”.
[7:35:00] 91Niki: But if anyone in charge has a little bit of common sense, they would be a grown up, stand up and take the blame. Help her out with medical bills and shit. Earn up to the mistake.
[7:35:01] mavericks312: prepatch is the 25th your 3 months to late lol
[7:35:02] Eviltuna13: She can’t sue since she signed a waiver before doing it
[7:35:06] rLeo2: no official announcement yet
[7:35:09] angrywowplayer1337: Bunch of nelfs*
[7:35:14] Kneckt: @Eviltuna13 the waiver dosent mean shit
[7:35:21] mozavich: @Eviltuna13 false
[7:35:25] gwildorr_: @91Niki She can't sue Twitch.  It will be the third party group who put together that event (not twitch) and was responsible for waivers that are liable, if they are at all (again - waivers signed releases them from any harm)
[7:35:28] KuromiBlackheart: wait, prep atch on the 25th?
[7:35:31] Shurn_82: @Eviltuna13 she could, likely going for neglegence on whomever hired/did the set up
[7:35:31] GordoHippo: i thought thats what your title meant, my b
[7:35:32] mavericks312: @91Niki especially since someone in her line of work isnt paid very well
[7:35:33] KuromiBlackheart: prepatch*
[7:35:40] EKS90_: @91Niki yeah it was so bad :/ trying to flollow it on twitter has been.. interesting to say the least. there are full threads of multiple things that was NOT ok, misgendering, laughing at peoeple during panels, its a lot
[7:35:46] BlewGamingGroup: that waiver isnt worth the paper it was printed on
[7:35:46] 91Niki: @Eviltuna13 A waiver doesn't do anything if you fail to live up to normal standards of safety
[7:35:50] N3llee: @gwildorr_ she can and will by CA law.
[7:35:56] Sollice: @91Niki This is terrible information lol and not true
[7:36:00] Kinghorn: questing it will still last a bit
[7:36:00] gwildorr_: @N3llee 100% wrong ---
[7:36:06] AllenzoTV: it takes so long to build up rested tho
[7:36:11] N3llee: I'm a 100% right.
[7:36:24] GordoHippo: 100%
[7:36:34] 91Niki: You literally can't use a waiver if you break every safety rule in the book LUL
[7:36:47] gwildorr_: @N3llee contact me in my office.... you can speak to my paralegal who will tell you how wrong you are - even in CA.  Waivers were signed.
[7:36:49] Austei: a waver does not wave negligence
[7:37:05] N3llee: Actually her signing the waiver helps her. because the waiver implies proper and lawful setup of the event.
[7:37:14] N3llee: or the booth
[7:37:16] Shurn_82: @N3llee bingo
[7:37:16] 91Niki: Not to mention NOT taking responsibility WHEN an accident happens in the first place. And just keep the place running
[7:37:27] unc0de: @91Niki  IDK, ever heard of mckamey manor? their waivers basically say its not our fault if you die, and it holds up in court
[7:37:30] 91Niki: @N3llee This exactly
[7:37:33] muzicz: A law firm that saw a gap in the market.
[7:37:36] exbuddha: what do you need a lawyer for?
[7:37:41] MILESkg21: KEKW
[7:37:42] Sollice: Waivers are NOT used to excuse gross negligence
[7:37:43] muzicz: Whats there name?
[7:37:43] EKS90_: foampits have a regulation to follow, if you dont follow that and you get people hurt, a waiver won't save that.
[7:37:54] BlewGamingGroup: they download those contracts off of google docs hoping people just sign em
[7:37:59] 91Niki: @Sollice This
[7:38:00] StreamElements: Use code POGTOWEL120 for $120 off at https://strms.net/TowellieeFactorMarBot #ad
[7:38:09] NerdyTeK: faze contracts WutFace
[7:38:09] KuromiBlackheart: @exbuddha plenty. being a streamer, or supporter of a game is no joke. you can get into legal trouble if you break ndas.
[7:38:20] Austei: my work stuff is crazy too yep
[7:38:22] unc0de: As someone who works in the superior court in NJ - I can attest that most waivers hold up in court if signed by both parties.
[7:38:28] Molvonos: lolno
[7:38:30] exbuddha: can u give me some examples? im curous
[7:38:33] MILESkg21: they own you
[7:38:33] gwildorr_: @unc0de got em
[7:38:34] muzicz: How long sorry?
[7:38:35] mozavich: @N3llee @gwildorr_ i lol'd. waivers aren't a get out of jail free card for companies to exemplify gross negligence.
[7:38:48] muzicz: perpetuity?
[7:38:50] cannibalcanyon: and people sign it lol
[7:38:55] TheUnknowing: even if the content has nothing to do with the game?
[7:38:58] NerdyTeK: i own this channel now speak to my lawyer
[7:39:20] TheUnknowing: insane
[7:39:21] Shurn_82: @unc0de unless you can prove negligence, which they would have to review the proper installation and operation of the event
[7:39:23] KuromiBlackheart: @exbuddha privacy mostly. if a company isn't ready to publicize something. they can hold a person accountable for 'leaking' it too soon.
[7:39:27] muzicz: Theyre young and see 50k and their brain fails
[7:39:31] ijuki: Easy, do not stream for 3 months Kappa
[7:39:34] exbuddha: i see
[7:39:41] Smeerzak: A good lawyer will save you so much money
[7:39:43] NerdyTeK: same shitty contracts in music
[7:39:45] 91Niki: @unc0de Laws are A LOT more strict in Cali with stuff like that
[7:39:50] Sollice: Your also forgetting she was not the first person who was injured on this prior to her injury. So again a waiver is not going to protect against something that should have already been deemed unsafe
[7:39:52] exbuddha: i am going thru a fake lawsuit myself... that's why im curious
[7:39:57] MILESkg21: i want that TPS REPORT NOW towRage
[7:40:02] EKS90_: @unc0de im not into US law im not american, but isn't it very different from state to state?
[7:40:10] jerseyfive: they will deepfake you LUL
[7:40:19] Sollice: The vendor had a responsibility after the first injuy was reported to make the ride safe or take it out of use. They didn't
[7:40:25] muzicz: Is the vod ownership in perpetuity?
[7:40:31] bdna2: those tiktok kids and their streamer houses get scammed by contracts all the time
[7:40:32] Austei: yes we do
[7:40:35] ZeusDNA: I'm gonna tell my lawyer to read it twice now!
[7:40:42] Shurn_82: @unc0de yep, cali is an extremely picky Health and Safety state.  A lot of my old job ( fire protection) they would compare how strict our rules are in canada, but nothing compares to cali
[7:40:45] Eviltuna13: Best tweet I saw about it was “ porn star breaks her back in two places and it’s not related to porn” cohhFee
[7:40:50] mavericks312: damn braves getting worked 7-1
[7:41:02] KuromiBlackheart: @exbuddha aahhh, well. smaller streamers don't really have to deal with it because they don't get sponsorships as often. but if you are big like Towe or bigger, you need to have legal support ready just in case something gets screwy.
[7:41:02] unc0de: IT would really depend on the language used honestly. But if the language similar to "twitchcon is not liable for any injury caused during this attraction and/or set up by outside agency." ....she cant sue.
[7:41:08] Daganatv: What type of Weapons do Devastation Evokers use?
[7:41:30] pereadin: yeah caster shit
[7:41:39] exbuddha: my lawsuit is related to other work
[7:41:39] BlewGamingGroup: theyre basically a battle mage
[7:41:42] Kneckt: @unc0de thats IF its set up properly which it wasn't
[7:41:43] exbuddha: but i understand
[7:41:43] Daganatv: Thanks Tow
[7:41:43] muzicz: Holy legal jargon in chat batman
[7:41:45] Jayros990: 2h maces and swords too

[7:42:03] Silverwards: we were told Evokers would use the same as Shamans, but without shields and plus swords

[7:42:11] kalamari__: new 30:70 split and 10 minute ads incoming because of the expenses twitch will have of this LUL
[7:42:14] ZeusDNA: I am in fact, not a lawyer LUL
[7:42:17] EKS90_: im swedish so im not into how it works in the US hence why I asked ^^
[7:42:19] unc0de: @Kneckt but im saying she can sue the outside agency who set it up, but not twitch or twitchcon, most waivers pass the blame to outside agency
[7:42:20] PokerFaceMoose: im not a lawyer but i play one on the internet
[7:42:23] N3llee: CA has a lot of fuckery type rules.
