[0:31:35] lorddrekken: big dog focus time
[0:33:28] aumixp: So now its official about the catalyst.. DF biggest problem is it is so damm late getting it
[0:34:22] MFAM_THE_Steven: know the cost of an item yet?
[0:34:27] CeruleanStar: 2k rating and 400ilvl and i still can't get invited to a 16+ lol
[0:35:03] infektyd: more brm buffs?
[0:35:49] aumixp: @towelliee do you know if they said about any currency for the catalyst?
[0:36:04] mavericks312: are you guys on Dathea towel?
[0:36:48] wEiRdO_dUdE: "...they noted that crafted gear cannot be used in the Inspiration Catalyst." Big surprise
[0:37:29] aumixp: We allready knew crafted couldnt be tier
[0:37:39] mavericks312: @wEiRdO_dUdE makes sense tbh
[0:37:46] Getiikku: PUT YA HANDS UP.. For Detroit
[0:38:01] wEiRdO_dUdE: Is there a WQ source of gesar that can be used in the catalyst?
[0:38:14] aumixp: no
[0:38:19] aumixp: no wq gear
[0:38:26] lorddrekken: yeah it would have been nice to see crafting high ilvl gear and turning that into tier
[0:38:32] wEiRdO_dUdE: So we're back to having to do raiding or mythic+ for tier
[0:38:39] zeiours: how does it work. so if you have a 390 ilvl shoulders dropped in a dungeon, you can take that and get 390 tier shoulders?

[0:39:37] wEiRdO_dUdE: In Shadowlands, we were able to use those dorky gear pieces from Zereth Mortis for tier
[0:40:08] wEiRdO_dUdE: Not the regular zone gear, but that  transmog stuff that needed the special currency
[0:40:46] wEiRdO_dUdE: Why does it matter? Because not everyone raids. Not everyone does mythic+ either
[0:41:07] mavericks312: you can use the primalist gear though
[0:41:49] wEiRdO_dUdE: That stuff has its own set bonuses already
[0:42:07] myfans4141: iI am wealthy, right towelliee
[0:42:34] mavericks312: did anyone actually think they would let crafted gear be used though?
