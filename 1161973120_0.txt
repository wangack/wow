[0:13:58] Smith6612: That's why you use KeePass. You control your data. It's encrypted
[0:13:59] golaki: @donat_jo  TakeNRG HahaCat
[0:14:00] foggyminer: then you could change all the passwords at once
[0:14:08] GreenRanger16: TRUE

[0:14:46] lovelyzsj: i dont even know my passwords KEKW
[0:14:51] CallMeInfinity: If they get hacked assuming they encrypt your shit only your salted?hashed? passwords would get leaked, so they wouldnt really know shit
[0:14:55] CallMeInfinity: afaik monkaLaugh
[0:15:03] Hykisho: thats why you reset you password every time you log-in 5Head
[0:15:03] dotrobin_: thats dumb af lol
[0:15:04] lovelyzsj: jakenbakelive69
[0:15:06] Smith6612: Password managers prevent phasing because they only fill the passwords out into trusted sites and apps. If it's phishing it won't get auto filled.
[0:15:10] karate_____: so it's not a good idea to keep all your passwords in a notepad file on your desktop? asking for friend
[0:15:17] cyclingpanda: password1234 PepeLaugh
[0:15:20] Rykane: I use randomly generated password that I don't even know but it's secure and I can use the LastPass plugin on the browser to easily sign in, its website sensitive so it shows up

[0:15:41] s__5_km: lol
[0:15:44] Smith6612: If you tell the password manager to fill your password into a phishing site then its on you.

[1:46:34] Bishox: wand is bis for mages until likr p5
[1:46:41] Yaerry: @TwoAteTwo use abilities, kill big guy
[1:46:50] Yaerry: and have loot drama thats wow
[1:46:59] Bishox: for arcane at least
[1:47:48] Yaerry: yeah same here having a guild kinds makes it chill, waiting to see if that will last in Black Temple KEKW
[1:47:50] Bishox: @jakenbakelive its the only good wand that has no Hit- and arcane gets 10% hit from talents so we avoid all the hit
[1:48:10] Bishox: in p4 actually i think you replace it
[1:49:08] Bishox: its not that its a really good wand its that we dont get better ones LUL
[1:49:38] Bishox: yeah im arcane pumper
[1:49:43] Bishox: im on EU
[1:50:15] tridzb0b: duelist Sadge
[1:50:36] Bishox: because of how much rogue helps casters on KT ive grown to like yellows

[1:51:41] Bishox: +25% magic dmg taken
[1:52:02] Bishox: and rogue is best to apply it on thaladred cuz you can evasion
[1:52:41] EZplus1: @TwoAteTwo that's all understood so far, bu tid like ot learn it a bit more indepth
[1:53:27] Bishox: i feel like thats griefing too much support- you either go full physical or full magic support if you are class stacking
[1:53:39] Bishox: so hunter or warlock stacking basically
[1:54:09] Yaerry: thats good for speedruninng aslong as you're not running a meme comp then it really doesn't matter if you can clear
[1:54:25] Bishox: @jakenbakelive well world first clear had a pretty balanced setup almost one of every spec just didnt bring a rogue
[1:54:38] Bishox: cuz rogues dont got a lot of aoe
[1:54:52] Yaerry: F

[2:08:34] Bishox: fury and rogue benefit from it the best NODDERS
[2:08:45] Bishox: but thats not the only metric for loot
[2:09:05] CoarseHock69: yeah in theory it's good for hunter but I think it causes a real human to just clip their autoshots

[2:13:24] nichikaa: no kara gives so much loot like halfway through phase 1 u could pretty much fully gear a alt in 1 or 2 runs
[2:15:50] Bishox: @jakenbakeLIVE ITS so funny to see people in TBC playing their priest and shaman that were only for dispelling world buffs- like Bye buffs , KekBuff, OnyGone ETC KEKW

[3:00:33] Andles1: yoink my internet now
[3:00:44] nichikaa: i have spectrum
[3:00:54] nichikaa: not having fios in 2021 really sucks
[3:01:04] Smith6612: Ah gotcha. Does your router do real time bandwidth monitoring? Would be good to see if it can help figure out if it's Water's PC eating a lot of bandwidth.
[3:01:14] Smith6612: I use Spectrum too Sadge . FiOS stopped a block from my home.
[3:01:49] asez: are you using their modem or your own?
[3:01:56] nichikaa: itll say like up to 1000 mbps in the package or whatever then give you like 30 LUL
[3:02:03] Smith6612: My node at least isn't congested. Steady all day/night but I could definitely use more upload. I use the Spectrum modem but my own router.
[3:02:18] Smith6612: The Spectrum DOCSIS 3.1 modems aren't bad.
[3:02:43] ledankusmemus: @nichikaa key word: "UP TO" MoneyRain
[3:02:44] nichikaa: im about to move into a new apartment so hopefully i get all new internet cables/modem etc
[3:02:51] golaki: man, this hoss follower issue getting out of hand
[3:02:56] Smith6612: I did hear Spectrum's starting to replace Coax with Fiber in my area, though. They already have Fiber in newly built rural areas which I've seen.
[3:02:59] nichikaa: then ill just but a top tier router
[3:03:17] Smith6612: They're still not providing faster upload on said Fiber. But it's real EPON Fiber - like what you see in Japan, Korea, and China
[3:03:22] golaki: hoss is now infiltrating discord servers
[3:03:28] CallMeInfinity: Spectrum is still using coax??? wtf lmfao
[3:03:37] Smith6612: @CallMeInfinity Yeah it's Coax LULW
[3:03:55] strongtallguy62: Yoooo
[3:04:00] CallMeInfinity: not sure why verizon doesnt expand to the west coast
[3:04:03] Smith6612: In some instances they pull Fiber to the home and then it's Coax between a box outside and your modem. That is called "RFoG"
[3:04:05] CallMeInfinity: that shit is OP
[3:04:18] hobo_puncher: I pay $110 a month for 50mbps jnbCry
[3:04:38] Smith6612: @CallMeInfinity Verizon used to have service areas in Los Angeles and other spots on the West Coast. They sold those areas to Frontier.
[3:04:47] Smith6612: Anything Verizon out west now will be the 5G Home service.
[3:04:56] CallMeInfinity: Frontier... isnt that owned by another telecom company
[3:05:05] Smith6612: Frontier's their own company. Used to be called Citizens Communications
[3:05:10] CallMeInfinity: ah nvm then
[3:05:19] dium: my charter service is through coaxial cable :)
[3:05:25] dium: cable internet :)
[3:05:27] CallMeInfinity: Charter THIS
[3:05:30] Smith6612: Frontier also has service in my area. They start about 500ft from where I live. I'm in VZ Territory so I may still, hopefully, be getting FiOS in the next year or two.
[3:05:36] throbbin_bowls: charter THAT
[3:05:43] dium: we have a 400mbit plan :)
[3:05:44] Smith6612: Charter is Spectrum's company. Spectrum is just a brand name for Charter's services.
[3:05:57] CallMeInfinity: Dium you got problems like Jake?
[3:06:08] dium: not any glaring problems
[3:06:17] Smith6612: I have 1Gbps with Charter/Spectrum (Runs at ~ 1150Mbps down, 42Mbps up)
[3:06:30] dium: the service skips for a bit every day or every other day at random points
[3:06:32] CallMeInfinity: POG go move in with Dium
[3:07:24] dium: overall have been using charter for a very, very long time
[3:07:28] Smith6612: For a while I had Internet via DSL here. Had three connections coming in and I would bond them together. Got almost 50Mbps out of that.
[3:07:34] dium: @CallMeInfinity move in with THIS
[3:07:41] CallMeInfinity: Can I bring THAT
[3:07:42] golaki: a phoenix :O
[3:07:50] Smith6612: Then I got Charter installed, and ran Charter 50Mbps + 15Mbps DSL in a load balance / PBR setup
[3:07:53] dium: AND
[3:08:01] golaki: or one gigantic chicken
[3:08:11] Smith6612: Cancelled the DSL when Charter finally rolled out higher speeds to the area
[3:08:14] CallMeInfinity: KEKW Nah its a phoenix
[3:08:26] CallMeInfinity: @Smith6612, how long ago was this?
[3:08:32] Smith6612: @CallMeInfinity 3 years ago.
[3:08:34] golaki: haha, take that back, it looks like a legendary
[3:08:38] CallMeInfinity: Ah okay
[3:08:42] Smith6612: @CallMeInfinity But I was using Bonded DSL as recent as 4 years ago
[3:09:01] Smith6612: Had pfSense router at home, and a server in Chicago for aggregating the DSL connections
[3:09:06] kyrie_the_goat_: This is a ranged fight

[3:09:29] Smith6612: I think Jake uses Speedify for his backpack?
[3:10:11] asez: he uses liveu
[3:11:11] Smith6612: Basically Speedify didn't exist when I started aggregating DSL. So had to build it myself.

[3:11:54] CallMeInfinity: KEKW
[3:12:20] Smith6612: Network is so old/crap that OC-3 (155Mbps) is about all DSL has capacity wise. Spectrum poops all over that.
[3:12:26] Smith6612: 2.4Gbps per node on downstream.
[3:12:50] Smith6612: NA Infrastructure I guess PepeHands
[3:12:55] CallMeInfinity: Yea so dumb
[3:13:17] CallMeInfinity: I think I was in HS when one of my teachers mentioned fiber lines being laid out around my city
[3:13:23] Smith6612: But hey. If Verizon FiOS doesn't show up here to replace the DSL network... hopefully another provider called Greenlight Networks will show up here.
[3:13:39] Smith6612: Greenlight will sell up to 2Gbps/2Gbps to the home. $200/m for 2Gbps.
[3:13:48] CallMeInfinity: monkaLaugh 200 a month
[3:13:56] Smith6612: $70/m for 1Gbps symmetrical.
