[0:48:04] nikthevoker: do you have a 1min cd?
[0:48:19] sebastianohmsen: morning
[0:48:22] pr0x365: easier or tougher to play than RSham?
[0:48:43] surfon: ven how come this patch/expansion every healer likes mastery and patches before everyone went haste versa
[0:48:51] parmejohn__: i think hpal needs a rework but idk
[0:49:11] Reizzy42: yeah pally is all about cooldown rotating
[0:49:12] jacob_the_mage: better than mistweaver... if you overlap as mistweaver it's GG
[0:49:12] Renethadox: Is  it me or Venruki looks like a doctor ?
[0:49:32] pr0x365: might convince me to mess with HPal in BGs haha
[0:49:33] chaduvifa: ur qued as healer and waiting a que?
[0:49:35] Xeliumimar: ya im kinda over mw, no trinket or cocoon, 1 cc you lose
[0:49:41] pvalue01: do u ever think about ur mastery when healing
[0:50:04] jacob_the_mage: Mistweaver doesn't really fit this brutal dmg meta imo...
[0:50:16] Yaeo: hair looking good my friend
[0:50:19] Xeliumimar: more awc already
[0:50:22] Arubicon: tomorrow?

[0:51:13] xqooq: 10$ for 6-0
[0:51:19] weenteen1: @venruki how come you didn’t opt in to play in the tournament?
[0:51:20] bearzy331: Nah bro blast off in me
[0:51:20] pr0x365: Venruki/Talbadar/Reckful vs THE MOVE
[0:51:22] jacob_the_mage: You gotta get vengeance for "down goes Ven" and make it "Ven makes AWC go down"
[0:51:23] pr0x365: who wins?
[0:51:44] pizzanwingz: i miss shadowlands frost mage
[0:51:46] Magottx: i mean prob the move seeing theres  no healer there
[0:52:04] bearzy331: Wiz is a mouseover macro user killing totems before they spawn, I dont think u can beat cheaters
[0:52:04] Magottx: lol
[0:52:05] kusoneko: god tier player in 2015 = 1600 player in 2024
[0:52:25] knappster15: @kusoneko cap
[0:52:33] knappster15: 1600 players in 2024 run behind pillar and die without pressing cds
[0:52:34] jacob_the_mage: @kusoneko so what does that make 2400 players today?
[0:52:44] PuffnTuff: Good morning Ven
[0:52:49] orcrimmar: @kusoneko nice troll
[0:53:04] kusoneko: Why are you booing me, i'm right
[0:53:19] kusoneko: mostly cuz of weakauras tho
[0:53:41] nikthevoker: LUL
[0:53:47] bearzy331: Weakauras being allowing in tourny is pretty much letting bots play and win
[0:54:02] knappster15: Ret dies without walling or shielding LOL
[0:54:05] knappster15: what a god
[0:54:28] firsthokage: kick seduction?
[0:54:37] ImJordanHi: Woah dude check out this spiffy guy with a haircut

[0:54:57] shivwren: dewMLG
[0:55:02] jacob_the_mage: I was 2200 in cata.... I'm 2100 now... I maintained!!!
[0:55:05] Ry_Bann: What do you think the  easiest class to get glad is?
[0:55:37] Arubicon: does anyone recall a rogue named Dreadxxx or a paly named Aoshi from days gone by? vanilla era
[0:56:07] Arubicon: think they got the whole pvp started to what it is now
[0:56:19] jacob_the_mage: @Arubicon WHat about Vurtne and Grim?
[0:56:40] Arubicon: do not recall Vurtne
[0:56:41] Slayer_Eagleone: does anyone remember a arms warr named Swifty from tbc/wotlk?
[0:56:52] Slayer_Eagleone: glad warr
[0:56:55] OutlandishOW: i think everyone remembers swifty
[0:56:57] OutlandishOW: he was famous
[0:56:57] knappster15: This SP is TAKING it
[0:56:58] sepaluser: Did you see young meeps comment about you on his tier list?
[0:57:00] wiskmtg: on TruGCD, it keeps showing what looks like the reclamation talent.  Is that correct or is this another ability you have macro'd to holy shock?
[0:57:07] Tragictomb: can tyrs be purged off?
[0:57:19] rdubm: i love how hyped u get hahaa KILL KILL KILL
[0:57:21] brich121: no
[0:57:28] brich121: @Tragictomb negative
[0:57:30] ImJordanHi: Dude your barber is really great
[0:57:36] Ry_Bann: @sepaluser where is his tier list at
[0:57:37] weenteen1: srs question. what was the name of the rogue who made World of Roguecraft and how long did he play wow for?
[0:57:52] MaximumnNeo: i saw his tier list of players, pretty cringe imo
[0:58:05] pr0x365: Reckfu;
[0:58:13] pr0x365: Reckful's tier list**
[0:58:32] Fragssgaming: what arena frames addon are you using
[0:58:49] ParagonPlayer123: Of course Meep makes himself S tier... lol. He's decent at best. Also a little punk who calls out toxic players in shuffle, then does something toxic like a tier list of players in front of everyone to see.
[0:59:02] azael: WoW has always seemed way more knowledge based than mechanics, so I've never felt like "old school" players got out paced. Feels like all the top players have been playing for a million years lol
[0:59:27] Evoca85: Hey Ven, trying to decide on melee alt for next expansion. DH or Warrior?
[0:59:39] FeelsGoodManX: not when they don't deal damage to him 4Head
[0:59:41] Luigicamp: Luigicamp gifted a Tier 1 sub to azael! They have given 2527 Gift Subs in the channel! 
[0:59:46] Mfgergo: kishkumen i think @weenteen1
[0:59:49] pragma90: @ParagonPlayer123 i dont like meep myself but if you are trying to grow your channel with views, a tier list is an easy way to do it
[0:59:52] Badasti: say that when you watch Wizk snipe a spirit link
[1:00:00] azael: Thanks Luigi!
[1:00:00] OutlandishOW: making a tier list and getting everyone talking about you, good or bad, is a genius publicity move
[1:00:09] Luigicamp: 👍
[1:00:10] OutlandishOW: especially during AWC
[1:00:12] pragma90: @OutlandishOW this
[1:00:14] FeelsGoodManX: its not like Azael hasn't played for decades
[1:00:22] Barnacle12: He's a literal world champion though Kappa
[1:00:33] azael: I hadn't played warlock for 4 years and got rank 2 in shuffle after a few weeks 😂
[1:00:34] nikthevoker: azael would just need to learn spells basically LUL
[1:00:49] FeelsGoodManX: THE LITERAL WORLD CHAMPION
[1:01:05] Barnacle12: @azael love your casting btw
[1:01:06] chaduvifa: doesn't that feel kind of bad though
[1:01:14] bearzy331: In a world of pikaboo's be a venruki
[1:01:15] chaduvifa: that they are that needed for competitive play
[1:01:21] Kilamonic: yeah your UI is clean
[1:01:23] krisdahaka: what Ven's saying is that he cares about viewer's eyes
[1:01:27] Juliio29: @azael loved by all
[1:01:28] OGTweeter: they should remove weak auras from awc, lol
[1:01:35] Evoca85: Do you think it's crazy how minimalistic Pikaboo's UI/macro/WA set up is? Seems like he barely uses anything
[1:01:36] azael: Thanks @barnacle12
[1:01:42] bearzy331: they should remove all addons from tourny
[1:01:47] bearzy331: like before 4 years ago
[1:01:48] FeelsGoodManX: they should remove addons from wow
[1:01:53] FeelsGoodManX: 4Head
[1:02:03] bearzy331: addons induce cheaters
[1:02:03] Moobot: Latest video "These Are The Best Specs In Dragonflight PvP Right Now" view it here: youtu.be/-WB0Pe8nKKo
[1:02:37] Frig0z: They'd have to do a lot of UI work if they removed addons... or they'd have to simplify the game a bunch

[1:04:13] Frig0z: you ragequit alt + f4 ofc

[1:10:19] boundric: can you see your talents rq?
[1:10:20] Reizzy42: what are Vens thoughts on the AWC from the weekend?
[1:10:30] wiskmtg: Do you know why TruGCD shows the reclamation talent after you shock?  Mine doesn't.  Am I missing something here?
[1:11:00] Badasti: DH
[1:11:02] pr0x365: DH

[1:11:09] cruelhabbitts: dh
[1:11:10] vortex071232: resto druid

[1:11:26] vortex071232: what do you think is hardest healer rn ?@venruki
[1:11:30] flamingjob: Spriest
[1:11:31] Telarius1: Outlaw
[1:11:34] ItsBees: If I can do well with rdruid then it's easy LUL
[1:11:36] SwiisH_Tv: Healer - Rdruid Melee - DH Range - BM
[1:11:36] NiikNakkx: rogue isnt as hard as people think.
[1:11:41] Reizzy42: the issue with running a healer in arena and its hard to find good players above 2200
[1:11:41] Kilamonic: easiest class not best class
[1:11:42] flamingjob: Spriest is freaking godlike
[1:11:59] Badasti: I think Resto Druids have a fairly high skill floor though... if you cant predict stuff and prehot it feels awful
[1:12:08] Sosatko: how’d you like SP yesterday?
[1:12:15] Kilamonic: hop on and get results instantly is DH
[1:12:16] vortex071232: how hard is mist currently?
[1:12:27] kuaidog: how much longer do you think this season will go on for if you had to guess
[1:12:43] ItsBees: probs mid march
[1:13:17] Badasti: true
[1:13:17] boundric: 4set also help so much for rsham
[1:13:24] NiikNakkx: Glad is more about consistency imo. Be decent at your class and be willing to queue a lot
[1:13:30] SaintHearth: My favorite thing is when all the DH haters get stuck at 1400 on their DH lol
[1:13:31] NiikNakkx: Basics
[1:13:37] zozoqc: Hey @venruki , serious question. Have u ever considered what game would u be streaming if wow dies?

[1:16:04] Badasti: im torn between queuing up and levelling my dk / flying rat to get all classes to max level
[1:16:09] xoHOLLOW: i feel like mistweaver might be the most simple and boring healer as someone who has played everything except evoker :P
[1:16:35] vortex071232: i enjoy mistweaver and its not that easy especially with its current standing
[1:16:35] pragma90: do you have conquest badges from healing on pally

[1:26:34] bit0x: its booring healer in my opinion :D
[1:26:48] Zeniticon: you need zen to play it
[1:26:48] Sosatko: I love being mobile I think mw is fun
[1:26:52] zachgamegodx: caster mw is the new worst healer
[1:27:12] JDRincs: LUL
[1:27:14] vortex071232: i main mist stop the hate
[1:27:15] cruelhabbitts: mw is chill to watch
[1:27:17] bit0x: it has huge mana issues, otherwise he would be good
[1:27:27] Sosatko: I do think channeling soothing mist is very outdated vs other healers
[1:27:29] skez_live: I was going to talk a little crap about MW but with @mysticallx  I just cant do it... they are so fun :D
[1:27:30] vortex071232: yeah you run out fast in ss
[1:27:31] Zeniticon: just drink tea bro
[1:27:31] kyleuselton: hey @venruki i was wondering how much of what you notice during pvp casting you would notice while playing if that makes sense i noticed watching yall cast that you see so much is that just experience
[1:27:31] Sosatko: But its p fun
[1:27:33] tritonxlol: it has terrible mana
[1:27:35] vortex071232: huge healing capability
[1:27:35] SNAKEBOMBS22: mw is good
[1:27:39] pragma90: mw has worst mana in all healers
[1:27:41] Sosatko: Yeah they have
[1:27:49] Sosatko: for sure
[1:28:08] skez_live: if soothing mist was off GCD, the entire class would be saved for me
[1:28:13] Zeniticon: you just need to win before mana is an issue
[1:28:18] Judgejobrown: no vers monkaS
[1:28:24] Feanorian: N. Zane Lee Good
[1:28:31] skez_live: soothing mist, wait for gcd, press a heal... hate that
[1:28:33] lordelenath: I think this game has to much instant casting, not too little tbh.
[1:28:39] vortex071232: isnt that resto
[1:28:41] Feanorian: my favorite war of 1812 general
[1:28:46] Zeniticon: healers are all about instant cast now days
[1:28:48] loveandsupply: paladins needs buffed again
[1:29:00] vortex071232: no one goes on you as mist
[1:29:02] bit0x: all u need is mastery LUL
[1:29:05] syraxsis: nah ya good
[1:29:07] halaf23: DOWN GOES VENRUKI
[1:29:15] vortex071232: @venruki your expel harm thundering focus mist gives huge shield
[1:29:17] Shashka76: And what song is this lol

[1:29:30] prometheusx47: are you talking about the atake tier list lmao
[1:29:38] pragma90: whoah wtf, i just noticed the npc dungeon option. I wish they would make an npc arena option for practice
[1:29:38] tritonxlol: yes if ur dying
[1:29:43] tritonxlol: its a big shield in pvp
[1:29:43] bit0x: only if u are getting trained I guess
[1:29:44] tidusisthedream: STOP TROLLING PUT ICE BLOCK ON UR BAR IF U AINT GONNA PLAY VERS JK <3 U
[1:29:44] tritonxlol: like 300k
[1:29:46] vortex071232: if your getting gone on its a sweet shield
[1:29:49] drdoomkinx: whats ur vers with pvp ilvl?
[1:29:52] style5z: NPC healer in shuffle--problem solvedddddd
[1:30:00] halaf23: Whats your fav class this expansion mate?
[1:30:04] Zeniticon: 27% vers he had in pvp
[1:30:08] stealthwalker99: Not 30% vers on hpal is kinda troll they are like paper now
[1:30:12] Zeniticon: might be slightly lower with new bracers
[1:30:43] vortex071232: do you have 4 set? @venruki
[1:30:48] Zeniticon: devotion of speed
[1:30:51] vortex071232: ok good
[1:30:54] vortex071232: unplayable without
[1:30:56] Lancin1987: if you use the @player macro with RoP, dropping it exactly at your center makes it so enemy melee cant hit you from any side
[1:31:10] bransby09: Yea i got globaled 100-0 in a 4 second stun the other day on my hpal =/ but that can happen to a lot of healers
[1:31:17] style5z: @Lancin1987 unless it's outlaw Kappa
[1:31:18] Tenneiyl: playlist is a vibe today
[1:31:32] Sosatko: @bransby09 4 seconds? any healer dies in that lol
[1:31:34] loveandsupply: are you hyped about the hero talents in war within? gonna change up pvp a bit
[1:31:35] Bunzz3: what embellishments are you rocking?
[1:31:44] Lancin1987: @style5z thats true for any rogue spec that picks up the talent
[1:31:47] Zeniticon: blue silken and precog ?
[1:32:08] loveandsupply: a lot of broken classes first week

[1:32:27] lordelenath: tank arena meta. love the idea.
[1:32:32] skez_live: maybe they will adjust the tank stuff for pvp
[1:32:37] skez_live: it will require balance for sure
[1:32:44] Koraszdormu: Koraszdormu subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 27 months! What's good, Ven.  How you doing today brother?
[1:32:50] wEiRdO_dUdE: Mistweaver picking up brewmaster type stuff could be fun
[1:32:51] Badasti: as long as there is no borrowed power im happy
[1:32:58] Judgejobrown: what is this healer queue time
[1:33:12] lordelenath: how flabberghasted on a scale of 1-10 were you when echo was beaten in EU? And why is it a 42?
[1:33:17] Lancin1987: I hope The War within brings in native controller support, it would be way more chill to level alts on the chouch with a controller =p
[1:33:39] vortex071232: haircut looking handsome
[1:33:59] vortex071232: whats the title for?
[1:34:03] zachgamegodx: how do we feel about the incoming vers meta where classes like warrior and outlaw wish to stack as much vers as possible due to teh success in tourny
[1:34:06] Vramii: yo ven I’m looking for some dev evoker help. I play rogue, WW, and hunter at around 2200 rating. just started a dev evoker and am hard stuck 1800 basically by just doing one shots. I can’t survive melee cleaves. any advice to not get trained and still do dmg vs melee.
[1:34:08] zachgamegodx: trill is at 48% in arena he says
[1:34:14] zachgamegodx: with boomy buff
[1:34:15] tritonxlol: focus tea here prob
[1:34:25] vortex071232: i run zen focus every game against 3 interrupts+
[1:34:38] lordelenath: wait, do i have to go full vers on my arms warrior now?
[1:34:41] syraxsis: vers amps
[1:34:42] zachgamegodx: yes the versatile thing
[1:34:58] Badasti: giggidy
[1:35:02] Koraszdormu: I run Zen Focus, and I talent into Sheilun's gift.  And I get AoE LoH every 30 seconds with it.
[1:35:05] skez_live: imagine solo shuffle in BFA haha, gpie city
[1:35:12] Badasti: just the one ball though
[1:35:30] Badasti: upgraded to both, things are getting serious
[1:36:39] tritonxlol: can u feel the mana issues now lol
[1:36:58] nikthevoker: shuffle with gushing wounds
[1:37:08] vortex071232: I prefer using vivify with thundering tea, more value with mana dont know if its best option though
[1:37:48] Zeniticon: your mana isnt that bad compared to druid, 20k diff more or less
[1:37:53] gaulois62: hey guys does any of you know how to export plater profile%
[1:38:00] wyldeshock: rdruids just pve brocolli
[1:38:10] Zeniticon: you lack chest enchant tho
[1:38:11] tritonxlol: @Zeniticon the druid was bad with his mana and venruki was being as efficient as possible
[1:38:28] Zeniticon: the other one has 5% m,ana
[1:38:30] Zeniticon: mana *
[1:38:31] tritonxlol: u need reserve of intellecto n chest
[1:38:37] Voriq: @Zeniticon aint that the leg enchant?
[1:38:41] Zeniticon: both
[1:38:44] Voriq: o

[1:42:54] justvibing0033: man rise against is such a vibe rn…haven’t listened to them in a long time 🤘🏻
[1:43:09] knappster15: druid casting clone while his team is dying LUL
[1:43:21] driftwood_tc: the warr was pumping too that game
[1:43:23] kalibus1: This is the druid that played your first game as DH with me
[1:43:30] likeewlock: mid
[1:43:35] knappster15: that DK was feeling those armor nerfs that game
[1:43:42] Zeniticon: moral boost
[1:43:54] Shockey187: How are MW in 2s? Was thinking on playing one. Or even M+
[1:44:26] blkylol: @Shockey187 Fistweaver for M+, 2s you can play either
[1:44:29] Anthonyjp15: hello
[1:44:52] Anthonyjp15: Is wow hard to get into if you’re a new player?
[1:45:04] heymomimonttv: @Anthonyjp15 naw not really
[1:45:06] justvibing0033: @shockey187 mw is #3 healer according to murlokio
[1:45:07] Shockey187: Thanks @blkylol
[1:45:13] Shockey187: Ty
[1:45:13] heymomimonttv: theres more than enough resources out there for new players
[1:45:42] Anthonyjp15: I have a friend who wants to show me the game
[1:45:52] justvibing0033: @anthonyjp15 nah seems pretty easy to get into. lots of ways to catchup with gear
[1:46:01] knappster15: walls at 20%
[1:46:04] knappster15: doesnt axe toss the clone
[1:46:07] knappster15: LUL
[1:46:21] Zeniticon: what mmr is it ?
[1:46:37] official_nme: gotta love how resto Druid just heals through CC chains with ease..
[1:46:42] Anthonyjp15: raids are fun?
[1:47:34] justvibing0033: @anthonyjp15 if that’s what you like, they are yeah. mythic plus is a good time also. there’s a good amount of stuff to do in game whether it’s pve or PvP or both, you’ll be able to stay pretty busy
[1:47:58] Anthonyjp15: Do you have to do raids?
[1:48:25] OGTweeter: no you can get better gear easier with m+
[1:48:39] Synckery: @Anthonyjp15 nothing is mandatory in the game, can just do whatever you want to do
[1:48:43] Zeniticon: ggs
[1:48:44] schwammgurke: is it a noticeable difference between 1.8k and 2.1k in RSS?
[1:48:51] justvibing0033: @anthonyjp15 nah not at all. you don’t “have” to really do anything. it’s all about what you enjoy more. obviously at max level you’re gonna want better gear which comes from either raids/m+ or pvp
[1:49:04] Anthonyjp15: What is mythic plus? like a dungeon or something?
[1:49:20] official_nme: make sure to out reserve of intellect on chest
[1:49:22] Synckery: @Anthonyjp15 infinite scaling dungeons with "keys" that add difficulty to the dungeons
[1:49:22] azrothlol: the only cool thing?
[1:49:22] nightmxz: MW mobility isn't even that insane anymore though? Compared to rdruid and prevoker anyway
[1:49:39] OGTweeter: yeah, 5 man dungeons
[1:49:52] zachgamegodx: pres doesn't get to use its mobility to get away, they have to use it to get back to the fight or to heal
[1:49:56] Anthonyjp15: what is this he’s playing right now?
[1:49:58] SwiisH_Tv: @nightmxz right theyve given every class so much mobility its sickening
[1:50:22] justvibing0033: what are everyone’s favorite classes/specs to play right now in pve and PvP? I’m just coming back to wow and I haven’t played since the first 2 weeks of DF so I’m a bit behind and I’m having a tough time picking a main as well as a couple “main” alts
[1:50:27] Synckery: @Anthonyjp15 this is "solo shuffle" a pvp game mode where you play 6 rounds and everyone plays each everyone in 3v3 format and you win/lose points based on rounds you win
[1:50:34] sleightxyz: hello ven!
[1:50:56] Roundhere_: you can crackling jade the lock too for more dam for your melee
[1:51:09] Anthonyjp15: oh gotcha
[1:51:56] yippey_: mornin ven!
[1:51:58] kalibus1: YEP. Druid
[1:51:59] official_nme: dude went from 180k mana to oom in 15 seconds wtf
[1:52:02] pr0x365: what do you think so far?
[1:52:06] schwammgurke: is it a noticeable difference between 1.8k and 2.1k in RSS?
[1:52:07] joyrex_j9: sucks to run into an rdruid right away
[1:52:12] Vramii: yo ven I’m looking for some dev evoker help. I play rogue, WW, and hunter at around 2200 rating. just started a dev evoker and am hard stuck 1800 basically by just doing one shots. I can’t survive melee cleaves. any advice to not get trained and still do dmg vs melee.
[1:52:12] pvalue01: LOST MMR
[1:52:15] pvalue01: Tragic
[1:52:20] official_nme: get reserve of intellect for your chest
[1:52:27] Anthonyjp15: How much is the latest dlc?
[1:52:28] Synckery: @schwammgurke feels like at 2k+ people start knowing how to press buttons but still not at the right time lol
[1:52:31] pvalue01: I swear you should never be able to lose mmr for 3-3
[1:52:34] vuzlan: the dh went 0-6
[1:52:37] joyrex_j9: nah you didn't the druid just figured out all he had to do was stand away from you and heal
[1:52:38] vortex071232: you got screwed by team, happens a lot as mist
[1:53:20] yippey_: catchy song
[1:53:43] zachgamegodx: we'll never compare to the "quirky" absterge
[1:54:07] wackpoetic: MW Lobbies where your team is constantly running out of range/LOS is a crit; but still more chill than Pres lobbies
[1:54:21] Vramii: sweet ty
[1:54:29] casper24411442: I saw beartooth live
[1:54:30] lfkappachupa: do u ever use ur shift 4?
[1:54:31] casper24411442: It was fun
[1:54:38] skez_live: i hope they adjust the mmr and rating system a bit
[1:54:56] pr0x365: Ele Sham
[1:55:00] Badasti: hell yeah some mage action
[1:55:20] wackpoetic: can you tab over your mastery in arena I wanna see what it heals for
[1:55:51] official_nme: how much harder is it to climb shuffle as a healer?
[1:56:05] wackpoetic: official_nme about 200 - 300 mmr IMO
[1:56:06] jmetz75: do you feel like inflation is working properly?
[1:56:11] notCheddy: wheres that mog from?
[1:56:26] mayonaes: depends how high you want healer you can hit 1800 really fast and 2k does not take long
[1:56:45] boundric: 12 months*
[1:56:51] boundric: ?

[2:10:00] poroyou: I remember when this use to be a pie baking stream
[2:10:01] wEiRdO_dUdE: Hunter with a trap on the healer, looked like
[2:10:17] Badasti: @MongoSecurity as a mage I can't relate, most of the time I'm way too greedy with block, I guess its coz I cant do dam and I know once it's gone then everything will want a piece of me xd
[2:10:26] mayonaes: arcane still the best spec for mage?
[2:10:31] mayonaes: overall
[2:10:56] poroyou: Arcane is the best, Fire is the funnest, Frost is the tankiest
[2:11:36] jacob_the_mage: this song takes me back to my knee high sock days in high school
[2:11:37] Badasti: @mayonaes supposed to be, but you need a phd to play it
[2:11:37] dakotan517: ez
[2:11:40] knappster15: 6-0 angle
[2:11:43] Telarius1: IN GREENS

[2:12:38] knappster15: That 12 week trading post mog goes HARD
[2:12:40] Vramii: evoker
[2:12:41] Badasti: hell yeah
[2:12:42] okumaNOR: frostmage
[2:12:43] vortex071232: play sub rogue
[2:12:45] Badasti: lets go frost buddy
[2:12:48] Vramii: greeeeeenlizard
[2:12:51] Itankarenas: ice wizard and demon king
[2:12:52] Itankarenas: sounds good
[2:12:59] Wondernoobx: prevoker
[2:13:01] vortex071232: how do you q double?
[2:13:05] Badasti: nooo mage is better than flying rat
[2:13:12] vortex071232: Ohhh
[2:13:14] MongoSecurity: lmao flying rat
[2:13:29] conman_91: bathroom, washroom, or toilet. what do you all call it?
[2:13:35] MongoSecurity: This DH is thicc
[2:13:42] knappster15: Water closet
[2:13:43] vortex071232: imagine q pops now
[2:14:48] Mirnawz: q pop
[2:17:07] justvibing0033: what’s everyone’s favorite class/spec for both pve and PvP? my favorite two toons I play are warlock and rogue but I’m also looking for another class or two to get into playing. I like to have like 2 melee and 2 ranged so I can swap between them without getting burnt out on one
[2:17:19] Nachofez: @scoobydoob3300 hunter all day
[2:17:23] Badasti: @scoobydoob3300 frost mage
[2:17:26] Mirnawz: rdru
[2:17:44] aultymalganis: NODDERS
[2:17:54] vortex071232: @scoobydoob3300 mist
[2:18:01] pr0x365: Frost Mage and anything Shaman
[2:18:09] Badasti: i've got everything except dk / flying rat at 70 though, but ill level those soon too
[2:18:20] DuckyOnce: Warlock and Shaman
[2:18:21] Badasti: enjoy holy / shadow on my priest atm too
[2:18:25] Mirnawz: if i could choose a special power irl i'd go with shapeshifting :p
[2:18:34] vortex071232: How good is disc currently guys?
[2:18:41] vortex071232: been thinking about trying it out
[2:18:43] justvibing0033: @nachofez I haven’t played Hunter since cata I think lol I have warrior, priest, shaman, Druid at or around 70. I’ve thought about either ele or boomkin for my other ranged
[2:18:45] demtrollzZ: @scoobydoob3300 Dont really do much PvP this expec but PvE has always been Shadow Priest for me, its a lot of fun
[2:18:55] apollochild777: yo did u guys see the drama between miz and mitch
[2:19:04] Nachofez: @scoobydoob3300 i do hunter, shaman and monk. super fun
[2:19:10] justvibing0033: shadow priest wouldn’t be a bad choice. I might give it a go
[2:19:19] kalibus1: @apollochild777 who are these people
[2:19:36] apollochild777: @kalibus1 some streamers
[2:19:46] Mirnawz: mitch is reckful's buddy ig
[2:19:54] wowsuomi: Cool song
[2:19:58] Badasti: @scoobydoob3300 its an extremely polarising spec. if you are left alone you can do hella dam, esp if you cleave. But you might get something like a paladin blind off all your dots
[2:20:02] justvibing0033: lock and rogue are the main toons I’ve played for a bit. I just like to diversify lol I guess eventually I can max out whatever and give it a try
[2:20:07] Badasti: you'll also get focussed almost all the time XD
[2:20:23] Badasti: and in pve most shit just gets facerolled down before you get dots rolling i think
[2:20:29] justvibing0033: @badasti that’s how it always is on my warlock lol
[2:20:36] Badasti: yeah itll be much of the same
[2:20:48] Badasti: i like the contrast between sp and mage
[2:21:16] Badasti: when i get tired of being trained i log the mage you feel untouchable
[2:21:18] justvibing0033: I figured I’d play demo until higher keys at least. I just came back about a week ago and I haven’t played since the 2nd week after DF launch lol
[2:21:37] Vramii: the fact that blitz doesn’t give you free accounts is lame. you do so much for them. paying for two accounts when you should get them free.
[2:21:39] Badasti: nice, demo is good. I enjoy it on my lock
[2:21:43] vortex071232: q popped ruki
[2:21:50] Badasti: just annoying that you get kicked a lot
[2:21:51] vortex071232: mkxSHOCK
[2:21:53] zachgamegodx: what were streams like before solo shuffle
[2:22:14] justvibing0033: @badasti gear catchup doesn’t seem too too bad. maybe by the time I get caught up it’ll be time for s4 😂😂😂
[2:22:16] robbiebobbie91: bicmex just landed 2810 rating in shuffle daimn
[2:22:18] Badasti: LUL
[2:22:19] Badasti: lmao
[2:22:24] Badasti: thats fucking hilarious actually
[2:22:33] Blitzylive: is this replay or live?
[2:22:34] Reythewrecker: I thought blizzcon winners got sub for life rukiHmm
[2:22:41] vortex071232: @Blitzylive unalive
[2:22:50] shivwren: dewToxic
[2:22:52] happyheals: i LIKED DOING RBGS AND STUFF, NOW PEOPLE HARDLY DO
[2:22:55] Blitzylive: whzt?!?!?! i was so sad I thought you left for the day!
[2:22:59] happyheals: sorry caps
[2:23:14] demtrollzZ: @Badasti I dont think thats really still a problem. The rampup time is nowhere near as bad as in Legion/BfA. You mostly apply your dots and then start blasting, the dots are a very minor part of your dmg anyway
[2:23:28] Badasti: strong independent mang
[2:23:29] Moobot: rukiCool rukiBuddy rukiBuddy rukiBuddy rukiBuddy Nurzhul17 WELCOME TO THE BUDDY CLUB! rukiBuddy rukiBuddy rukiBuddy rukiBuddy rukiBuddy rukiCool
[2:23:36] Nurzhul17: Nurzhul17 subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 21 months, currently on a 4 month streak! 
[2:23:38] Vramii: I feel like they probably keep 1000+ subs because of you directly
[2:23:43] NJMcChillan: i know if i was sitting in queues like this all the time i would also have 2 subs
[2:23:59] zachgamegodx: it would encourage lots of ppl in the company to play the game which would likely make them better employees
[2:24:19] skez_live: I cant wait for war within, the game is going to be popping off, and even DPS may be able to get faster solo qs :P
[2:24:24] skez_live: Im a healer now though but w/e
[2:24:32] justvibing0033: I gotta find the “want to” to get caught up on my toons lol being 2 1/2 seasons behind has made me kinda meh when it comes to logging in and doing stuff 😭
[2:25:14] demtrollzZ: @scoobydoob3300 I also just started again a few months ago, I feel like you catch up pretty quick
[2:25:16] zachgamegodx: i wonder how they make the game without playing it as much as their intended audience bc they’re working alot
[2:25:18] Badasti: why though its such fun and engaging gameplay
[2:25:29] vortex071232: why is outlaw sos trong currently?
[2:25:32] VinnieK_: half year sub codes for themselves and family
[2:25:41] Badasti: i love having a target that doesnt die that constantly shuts down my ability to play the game LUL
[2:25:48] justvibing0033: @demtrollzz yeah the catch up doesn’t seem too bad, it’s just a matter of doing it lol
[2:26:10] justvibing0033: I’ve only been back a week @demtrollzz
[2:26:25] TheMediumJob: 33min adren rush monkaW
[2:26:26] mrxilio: hook/sap... super fast
[2:26:27] demtrollzZ: @scoobydoob3300 sure, but there are plenty of ways. Did the firelands timewalking raid and got nice pieces from the quests etc
[2:26:36] Badasti: @demtrollzZ ah might be true, i don't PvE so was just an assumption
[2:26:44] kusoneko: rising dong kick Pog
[2:26:54] stratusvii: holy cow rising sun kick hits hard
[2:26:57] QwQGolden: 350k fist 250k rising sun fist blizzard holy fuck please
[2:26:58] mrxilio: WW dmg balanced lul
[2:27:25] Magottx: 150k fists tick cmon man lol
[2:27:30] zachgamegodx: rogues that have combat tracking and sap ppl any time they drop combat  are most annoying
[2:27:30] demtrollzZ: @Badasti Yeah its much better now in dungeons. It was a good call to get rid of Mindsear. its all about psychic link now. You apply dots with shadow crash and then blow everything on 1 target basically :D
[2:27:48] justvibing0033: @demtrollzz yeah I missed out on tw this week which sucks because I could’ve gotten a good bit of stuff but rl stuff got in the way. I know there’s another TW in a week or something so hopefully between that and me not being lazy I’ll be able to get at least to 450 and do low keys and get back into PvP
[2:28:30] profreshtv: did yall see mitch jones new video?
[2:28:48] Badasti: @demtrollzZ trueee forgot about shadow crash
[2:28:49] nerdyorc_: just had 2 lobbies in a row with ppl leaving, great use of an hour total of queue time
[2:28:59] zombiecrew11: how is that possible - I was driving home and listening Walking Disaster - then I joined the stream and it is here. Ven is a true MAGE!
[2:29:11] drdoomkinx: why does outlaw have passive 30-40% move speed shadowstep and grapple?
[2:29:20] justvibing0033: idk if anyone really cares about Mitch and the video he posted 🤷🏻‍♂️ it doesn’t involve me so
[2:29:42] stratusvii: @nerdyorc dude i feel you. So frustrating when they do that
[2:30:08] vortex071232: how difficult is disc?
[2:30:14] zachgamegodx: I’m not a good outlaw but I’ll tell ya, blink stun mages are way harder to attack than shimmer mages
[2:30:15] Somanie: rukiPie
[2:30:16] Magottx: I've been having so much success training frost mages on warior lately. reflect too op if they ever get a chacne to cast
[2:30:20] Badasti: @scoobydoob3300 dunno if care is the right word, but it's really between them and the police imo
[2:30:28] Zeniticon: do you ever play with freezing cold and frigid winds vs melee ?
[2:30:30] justvibing0033: @vortex071232 I know it’s one of the best for m+, and it’s solid for PvP
[2:30:32] chaps_86: @vortex071232 not terribly if you're good at trading cds.

[2:30:55] justvibing0033: @badasti no doubt. a few people keep mentioning it in chat here and I don’t think anyone is concerned about it because it doesn’t involve us
[2:31:25] Badasti: plus when i play blnkstun i really struggle to get poly's and rings off... so much easier to start casting and shimmer to finish the cast or land it around pillars
[2:31:34] stratusvii: that was a sick ray

[2:33:38] kalibus1: @Somanie well hello! Flamedramon here
[2:33:39] justvibing0033: my excitement isn’t about a big life change but I am finally upgrading my pc so I’ll be enjoying wow and my other games in 4k 🤙🏻
[2:33:57] Somanie: @kalibus1 niiiiiice!! Hey buddy! rukiBlankie
[2:34:48] Somanie: @scoobydoob3300 that's also very exciting!! I'm hoping to upgrade my computer sometime this year too with this new job
[2:34:55] pr0x365: How much would a PC build cost for WoW?
[2:35:01] dipicat: outlaw / dh ruin my life man
[2:35:32] pr0x365: I've only bought the case so far
[2:35:33] Somanie: The PC I would want to build (for WoW and other high fps games) is like $2k
[2:35:55] justvibing0033: @somanie I finally just got settled after a big move and new job. I’ve been saving since lol gonna be spending a nice chunk of change because I’m buying a new monitor but it’s worth it for sure
[2:36:00] Badasti: hell yeah
[2:36:02] DoYouWannaHug: @Somanie That's a solid price.
[2:36:06] Badasti: take that outlaw down to pound town
[2:36:11] yippey_: what a fucking round lol
[2:36:13] yippey_: jesus
[2:36:23] Somanie: But I'm aiming for a 4070 GPU and 32GB RAM. For WoW tou could get away with 16GB RAM and a less-new GPU for cheaper
[2:36:29] justvibing0033: my build is coming in around $2300 but that’s because of the extra fans and new mouse+keyboard I’m getting lol

[2:36:57] wowsuomi: Tell us how u really feel lol
[2:37:09] justvibing0033: @somanie I’m getting a 7900xtx and 64gb of RAM. my idea is I’m already spending money so spending a little extra for more won’t hurt lol
[2:37:20] Nachofez: whats the name of this song?
[2:37:23] pr0x365: Thats how it starts haha
[2:37:23] Nachofez: anyone knows?
[2:37:25] Somanie: @scoobydoob3300 that's fair too bro send that shit
[2:37:29] QwQGolden: If you moan about Rog please add Monks, Outlaw busted but atleast its more of a rotation than Fists & Rising sun kick fopr 600k dam
[2:37:29] fistweaveurnan: Im really going out of my way to continue a sub, my team quit last season LFG has been horrible. Strongly considering unsubbing until last 2 weeks of season for a push
[2:37:38] VinnieK_: banger playlist going right now
[2:37:57] justvibing0033: @somanie for sure. can’t wait to enjoy the 4k gaming experience and finally having a top tier pc will be dope
[2:37:59] zachgamegodx: dipi give us an except
[2:38:03] zachgamegodx: excerpt
[2:38:12] Somanie: @scoobydoob3300 this will be my first apartment away from home, no parents 😳😳 so I'm a little worried lol, but I can cook and clean so I'm sure it'll be ok
[2:38:13] VinnieK_: @Nachofez hellogoodbye - here
[2:38:17] pr0x365: @fistweaveurnan You'll be back haha. I said the same thing 4 months ago and here I am again
[2:38:28] Reuhn: didnt have a chance to check out the new 5700x3d am4 chip. could be really cheap on your build since am4 is not continued anymore
[2:38:43] dhezghia: thoughts on bdk in pvp @venruki ?
[2:38:47] dipicat: well the entire team loses the ability to play their character
[2:38:48] stratusvii: dude your pre alters are on point!
[2:38:49] pr0x365: @Somanie You got this! I'm yet to reach that goal so mad respect to you for that!
[2:38:49] dipicat: so thats pretty useful
[2:38:51] dipicat: its really convenient
[2:38:58] Zevx: rogues?
[2:39:01] dipicat: and you gain a partner who cannot die
[2:39:03] dipicat: VERY USEFUL
[2:39:06] Hark0n: that's why shadow priest looked good in AWC lol
[2:39:07] Nachofez: @VinnieK_ ty!
[2:39:09] fistweaveurnan: @pr0x365 Idk man LFG is impossible and its a waste of time queing all season when the only time that matters in the last 2 weeks
[2:39:16] caulibrower: What pvp talents u running ?
[2:39:18] Vramii: dude that new Mitch jones video is WILD holy crap
[2:39:21] justvibing0033: @reuhn that’s a good chip! I’m moving to am5 and getting the ryzen 7 7800X3D
[2:39:27] zachgamegodx: turns out rogue mage is a good comp
[2:39:30] AdamHeron12: can i get a quick look at your talents pls?
[2:39:44] Somanie: @pr0x365 💪🏻 sending energy your way homie, you'll get there and kill it
[2:39:46] Zevx: looks like good mage lobby
[2:39:49] Reuhn: @scoobydoob3300 yeah I got it too. I have a beastly machine but can't get max fps on valdrakken LMAO
[2:39:55] DoYouWannaHug: @pr0x365 ya but the queueing boils down to, do you have fun or are you doing it for only rating if its the rating just wait
[2:39:55] zachgamegodx: 4 cheap shots
[2:40:10] demtrollzZ: @Somanie Worried? That's where life begins! The freedom is more than worth it :P
[2:40:14] dipicat: the thing about outlaw and dh is they also ahve the best mobility in the game
[2:40:14] sleepzqt: venruki what would happen if wow gets free to play?
[2:40:18] dipicat: and are immune to death completely in shuffle
[2:40:19] pr0x365: @Somanie I appreciate you! and you got this brotha! you'll be killing it with your new PC
[2:40:20] justvibing0033: @reuhn I don’t think anyone can get max fps there lol I’ll have a beast pc soon! can’t wait for the 4k gaming!
[2:40:22] dipicat: swear dh cannot die in shuffle
[2:40:24] dipicat: only real 3s
[2:40:33] ariacy: I had a 2s match yesterday that was about 2.5mins facing outlaw/rdruid and I was cc'd 47 secs of the game lol
[2:40:39] zachgamegodx: i think that was one of those pure dmg outlaws that doesn’t cc much
[2:40:50] Jerd9: whats with the healer/dps mmr in shuffle, one game as hpal im playing with 2200 players that are ex glads an i get 4-2 an get 20 rating the next wim with ppl that have played 15 rounds go 4-2 an get 4 rating
[2:40:52] Badasti: @sleepzqt I think that'd be awful, it'd mean they'd need to monetise the game more than they already do through cash shops and selling boosts etc... It'd probably go some flavour of pay to win
[2:40:55] Somanie: @demtrollzz the freedom is gonna be so nice fr

[2:41:44] fistweaveurnan: @Vramii who cares
[2:41:49] mrxilio: need to return CR gains to Season 1 levels
[2:41:58] kreyzy8: I bet you wouldn't notice if the ques weren't 30+ mins

[2:42:17] justvibing0033: who cares about the Mitch jones video 🤷🏻‍♂️ it’s between them and the police
[2:42:19] Badasti: kneecap huh
[2:42:26] kalibus1: grow more, shorty
[2:42:28] jjc7728: dont need to say numbers but I would imagine you make more money streaming than being a contractor for blizzard right?
[2:42:30] KhAoTiCFeeLeY: hot take- every season should restart everyone’s mmr to 1500. High level players have an extreme advantage
[2:42:31] gianni_gsp: @venruki do you think ww damage is overtuned?
[2:42:35] shivwren: You aren't short, you're 'fun-sized'!
[2:42:38] Badasti: tahts more like butt cheeks height
[2:42:40] mrxilio: @kreyzy8 im convinced there isnt a fix for that lol... been multiple seasons/months... no fix
[2:42:48] kusoneko: theres 3 sides to every story, his, her's and the truth
[2:42:52] sleightxyz: what happened?
[2:42:57] zachgamegodx: I’ve learned 2 programming languages in the last 6 months of playing wow and waiting inn solo shuffle q while watching ven

[3:34:18] zachgamegodx: the awc discord
[3:34:20] itsBdaws: @venruki do you think allowing class bans each match, with no repeating bans for the next round so every team gets to play their main comp ATLEAST once would be a good change to bring more class diversity to awc or would it just be an unnecessary change
[3:34:30] Dreamy2k3: @venruki yes " we are mvp" EU
[3:34:37] jporter_: jporter_ subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 8 months! yo yo

[3:35:10] fistweaveurnan: @itsBdaws I dont like class bans, spec bans maybe
[3:35:23] Twinscroll: yeah hard to not get trained on them... non one wants that disintergrate spam .. lol
[3:35:45] itsBdaws: @fistweaveurnan I like it, that would still bring more diversity
[3:35:49] azael: Venruki has all the answers

[3:36:27] FateIRL: thats actualyl a great idea
[3:36:27] ar1dqt: dont agree, but Im just a 1800 andy so idk
[3:36:29] azael: Bans are so good for tournaments IMO, way more fun to force variety
[3:36:36] shredder1111: what if the healer is a one trick though
[3:36:38] FateIRL: run that idea by blizz
[3:36:44] dredar7: that would just make the Move kick Jelly :(
[3:36:55] Badasti: id give anything not to watch rogues and sidekicks every. single. awc
[3:37:03] gaulois62: only thing i feels is there alot less class than say league of legends
[3:37:05] guesswhofoo: azael venruki and cdew the evil geniuses!!
[3:37:09] mat4th: have one team ban a spec and the other team ban a map
[3:37:16] sourbutts: i think its crazy nobody counter comped them
[3:37:16] mat4th: and then cycle
[3:37:18] Jiviex: just do it like league. 5 rounds of bans each.
[3:37:22] FateIRL: many 4ths are just bench warmers
[3:37:22] Zeniticon: everyone would just insta ban rogues
[3:37:23] itsBdaws: Man those changes would be so sick for the viewer
[3:37:24] jimmystruggs: or force alternating every game
[3:37:24] heymomimonttv: i think the only time u can run 1 comp the whole way thru is if ur comp includes a rogue lol
[3:37:29] FateIRL: mes and jelly wouldd get kicked lol
[3:37:29] krisdahaka: LUL
[3:37:32] FateIRL: hate to say it
[3:37:35] azael: Yeah for sure, IDK if you can solve it but maybe you can't ban healer specs but can ban DPS specs only?
[3:37:35] poroyou: I think the Move would keep Jelly bc they're homies
[3:37:39] markaimfire_: Maybe force each of a single armor typw
[3:37:44] YouAint_VeryBusy: jelly is only on the team for moral suppoort anyway. Jelly doesnt win games
[3:37:52] Reizzy42: so do you just get a ban after everry win then?
[3:37:56] YoMamaSoFine69: maybe it time for phdk for jelly mes and crusader
[3:37:57] lasergazer3: What
[3:38:00] malvarcla: @venruki heres a better idea, why dont we just ban a whole person from playing?
[3:38:02] markaimfire_: mail, leather, cloth

[4:21:22] dakotan517: big true
[4:21:25] Aramith9: theres no arenas
[4:21:27] Cocoapuffs1: keep doing same shit over and over on different versions of the same game

[4:25:54] jfeliciano007: Same thing happened to me. Favorite chinese place solld to new owners and it's not good anymore
[4:25:54] Studze: It totally sucks too because once you have really really good chinese food, it ruins the rest of chinese food for ya
[4:26:16] Extramediums: damn ven, time to make your way to the west coast for some amazing regional Chinese restaurants all over, and sooo many in Richmond
[4:26:22] Sheepyou: cant be that good if the closed Kappa

[4:26:40] Kittensrcute: find a place that makes xiaolongbao
[4:26:40] Extramediums: There's a indo-Chineese place across the street from me that does spicy stuff, and it's soooooo damn good
[4:26:46] Tippolippo: do you play on use trinket on the mage?
[4:26:49] chaps_86: @toxi28 it's not an illusion, its just the way the weap looks

[4:27:22] Studze: In high school, a friend of mine's family owned a Szechuan restaurant, they closed it down and moved back to china. Never been able to find food as good as that anywhere
[4:27:29] MrChillGates: Yup. No need
[4:27:32] foxyllama: they might have a massage parlor too
[4:27:38] Itankarenas: just use google maps
[4:27:44] Itankarenas: I look up restaurants like that all the time
[4:27:47] matt_caste: Han Dynasty is SO good, Anthony Bourdain featured it at one point. So spicy kids can't go there in case they touch their eyes
[4:28:04] Kittensrcute: this stream is making me hungry
[4:28:18] Extramediums: alberta has been getting a lot more diverse restaurants over the years since I lived there. In Edmonton, the Millwoods neighborhood had some of the best indian veggie samosas I've ever had, it was a mom and pops operation, and next to it was this amazing Jamaican patty hole in the wall
[4:28:40] Itankarenas: He's just talking about the Han Dynasty in Chinese history
[4:28:42] Itankarenas: Kappa
[4:28:44] matt_caste: No, one in Philadelphia and one outside in NJ, my brain just went there for a second when you said Han's

[5:06:59] Riderqt: same thing with nba, shoes dont matter, you see kyrie moving in sketchers
[5:07:02] What_ln_Tarnation: what about 10k CAD
[5:07:09] CmxtheWW: if youre a normie you should be the best race 100P to help your losing odds
[5:07:11] Leredi: but nobody is whazz, except whazz

[5:07:19] Banwellx: Damn your barber is only 10k per cut? good deal
[5:07:21] jxygodx: mechagnome best race and no one plays it

[5:07:26] willie_stroker_99: Are you sure about that?
[5:07:30] matt_caste: 5k for the head, need a beard for the full 10k, final offer
[5:07:35] DankLloydWright: void elf is actually good tho
[5:07:40] SirBeaverTeeth: tauren mage seems underrated
[5:07:44] coke_vanilla: i play vulpera mw. i know im griefing compared to ne mw
[5:07:47] nightmxz: I was top of the ladder in SL as blood elf lol
[5:07:49] princesstoni01: i cant play void elf anymore cuz of voidchaos
[5:07:49] zachgamegodx: ya us regular folks need those 1% edges because we’re not Whaazz
[5:07:53] drdoomkinx: Void is sleeper no cast kncockback on dmg
[5:07:58] nightmxz: top 40 last season as velf too lol
[5:08:00] Grimm303: @kelfeno im sure we can muster up the other 300 :)
[5:08:04] Riderqt: half the head technically
[5:08:07] Xenon_cl: he's got like a rich viewer..i forget his name..this has happened before..he was paid 10k to shave his head completely the night before he was scheduled for a family pic
[5:08:13] DankLloydWright: 25%
[5:08:26] Metaphors: such an interesting thing
[5:08:26] meuteurlol: The beard really makes the haircut for Cdew
[5:08:30] k41dr: yo chat good luck everybody
[5:08:31] FateIRL: greenlizard made it to meeps tier list
[5:08:31] Metaphors: how night elf is so insane

[5:08:56] nightmxz: It's funny that meld deletes destro portals LUL
[5:08:57] Bmojo: @venruki thought u were gearing sp after awc. what are ur thoughts on sp?
[5:08:58] selkies3: dude I fucking love your stream for not just the pvp content but the music as well. the music is so on point
[5:09:00] matt_caste: LUL I just spent 19k USD on cancer treatment for my dog this week, don't think I can pull that off
[5:09:00] nightmxz: @Scottsima mage
[5:09:08] MythicBlack520: how'd you get the title Battle Mender?
[5:09:11] Somanie: 🤞🏻🤞🏻🤞🏻 for a rich viewer that's ppc
[5:09:12] malvarcla: pretty cool you can diffue magic + nelf racial against a affy lock and take no dam from ua and all that
[5:09:17] chaps_86: 1 small change for rogues is not allowing them to get subterfuge after using meld.
[5:09:19] Blastmindx: yeah nelf is really good
[5:09:31] willie_stroker_99: Guys, let's make a poll for Ven, to shave his  head
[5:09:36] Metaphors: u can reverse and nelf
[5:09:38] Metaphors: its disgust
[5:09:42] DaneDillon: I like night elf.. I don't like that I feel like I have to play it so I have 2 disc priests that are nelf and one that is kultiran
[5:09:44] Blastmindx: idunno why nelf makes you immune to stuff but it does
[5:09:49] Blastmindx: like you can meld stormbolt and stuff
[5:09:50] FateIRL: remember when hunters could feign all dots and take zero dam every 15 seconds
[5:09:52] DankLloydWright: i bet you can meld + MD then, like the old Fade MD
[5:09:54] Somanie: @matt_caste BiS pet parent though <3 I'm sorry to hear about your bb :(
[5:09:55] Vramii: playlist today is fire
[5:09:57] KhAoTiCFeeLeY: what happened to Drake, Brain and Prev? they quit AWC?
[5:10:00] malvarcla: just pressed em both at same time basically haha
[5:10:00] W00dyyx: Nelf is busted in m+ too. It needs to be changed
[5:10:09] selkies3: pop punk is the best genre
[5:10:13] selkies3: us
[5:10:19] Vramii: tell them to pick up mytical haha
[5:10:19] selkies3: js*
[5:10:21] SirBeaverTeeth: there was a rumour mehhx would replace brain, not sure if it was only gossip kek
[5:10:23] ferahgok: @FateIRL My feral remembers, and is still haunted til this day
[5:10:45] matt_caste: @Somanie Thanks! She's doing well at the start of the treatment today, all very hopeful
[5:10:45] Metaphors: i want them to remove drinking and balance healer mana
[5:10:45] markaimfire_: I agree
[5:10:47] Ultramagnus85: agreed
[5:10:55] FateIRL: drinking in general is stupid
[5:10:57] Riderqt: with the amout of combat bugs, I think some degree of abuse with meld is fine
[5:10:58] chaps_86: right now, my druid ooms faster than all other healers if i dont drink
[5:11:00] skarny1: i think arena ending based off whether drinks happen or not is kind of stupid
[5:11:15] DankLloydWright: i think drinking is unfortunately good for the game
[5:11:18] maxdoesmath: there should be something that spawns that restores mana like the shadowsight eye and the teams can fight over it
[5:11:19] pazta9: I think seting up drinks should be a part of the game but meld drink is dumb
[5:11:28] Somanie: @matt_caste good <3 I hope she keeps improving and hopefully you don't have to pay much more for that treatment. I lost my kitty to cancer almost 5 years ago, so I hope you're doing OK bro
[5:11:33] DankLloydWright: it's important to punish teams that play too passively
[5:11:44] DankLloydWright: but individual healers shouldnt be balanced around it
[5:11:54] DankLloydWright: should be equal across classes
[5:11:54] Extramediums: years ago they changed drinking to take a short period before you start getting the full regen, they could just expand on that
[5:12:19] Metaphors: dont think any1 has to drink but disc and rdru
[5:12:24] maxdoesmath: there should be something that spawns that restores mana like the shadowsight eye and the teams can fight over it
[5:12:32] Blastmindx: are you gonna play SoD in phase 2? @venruki
[5:13:00] yiannos1979: you play retail... how can u be excited for sod?
[5:13:05] Blastmindx: oh yeah i didnt think about awc
[5:13:06] shugguls: @maxdoesmath that’s a good idea
[5:13:11] User3600: isnt Phase 2 tommarow?
[5:13:14] zachgamegodx: the green lizard
[5:13:15] Banwellx: ven's gonna be leveling on broadcast don't lie to us
[5:13:15] matt_caste: @Somanie Oh I'm so sorry to hear that, it's so rough, we were not so hopeful last week, but looking up and my cat is ready for her pup to be home
[5:13:16] Riderqt: I thought SOD would be a bit more challenging, it's brain off mode
[5:13:32] learningtogrowtogether: anyone use a controller?  I missing fingers and can’t use the keyboard. need a new way to play
[5:13:36] Somanie: Have shit drop on the ground like Super Smash Bros and teams have to fight over it
[5:13:39] zachgamegodx: ven sod is not the cornerstone of this stream
[5:13:44] wackpoetic: have you looked at the 10.1 questing set mog for Evoker? It's siiiiick
[5:13:46] brewtank: lmao
[5:13:51] Badasti: i havent been very active in the last few expansions before DF - but I see Luminosity did some serious winning over the past few years
[5:13:55] brewtank: leveling is fun though but yea
[5:13:55] Badasti: pity they arent competing anymore
[5:14:19] meuteurlol: Classic is peak wow tho

[5:19:59] Badasti: maximum crank
[5:20:01] DaneDillon: That burst at the end tho!
[5:20:03] panjack13: death ray
[5:20:25] Somanie: @learningtogrowtogether nah I think we all play with keyboards :( I'm sorry.
[5:20:44] dakila24: you can play dh with a controller and some foot pedals
[5:20:56] Somanie: Have you tried the obvious candidates like an XBOX controller, or a PS controller, etc
[5:20:58] FateIRL: theres a feral who plays with controller got glad
[5:21:04] assrug: learningtogrowtogether i don't play with controller but i know that there are people who and there is addons to make it work
[5:21:22] Ultramagnus85: just double melee cleave all day every lobby
[5:21:27] learningtogrowtogether: @somanie no worries. been jumping streams trying to find someone who uses a controller

[5:22:49] learningtogrowtogether: middle ring and pinky
[5:23:09] learningtogrowtogether: so I can run right and jump. lol
[5:23:19] Somanie: Clicking might be an option? I'm a clicker lol

[5:23:31] FateIRL: wow has too many binds
[5:23:51] flawfox: @learningtogrowtogether google wow arena controller glad and there should pop up a reddit thread from the feral who hit 2.4k controller only
[5:24:00] Itankarenas: they're prob gonna reduce buttons since we're at max capacity rn
[5:24:04] learningtogrowtogether: no game is like wow. I have 6 lv75s I been dying to play again
[5:24:11] assrug: mhm i guess it's the best ones to lose if you gonna lose 3 but damn that sucks
[5:24:29] zachgamegodx: @learningtogrowtogether level cap is 70.
[5:24:46] assrug: give him a break he is typing with two fingers
[5:25:06] learningtogrowtogether: @flawfox didn’t even think honk about that. thanks. been on here for weeks trying to find a gamer who uses one
[5:25:13] Badasti: @learningtogrowtogether bro is playing next expansion already :O
[5:25:17] zachgamegodx: @sarug ROFL
[5:25:39] supahbroke: the set looks disturbing, confusing your opponents :p
[5:25:39] learningtogrowtogether: @zachgamegodx not classic
[5:25:44] columbian_vac: wtf wow on a controller is possible ?
[5:26:11] klocksmith: NO BLEEDING
[5:26:12] Itankarenas: @columbian_vac people already play it o nsteam deck
[5:26:16] learningtogrowtogether: @columbian_vac they finally added it
[5:26:17] levit8TNG: if i was to do it, get a pc style controller, bind the controller buttons as youd like, and make castsequence macros
[5:26:21] ryanblue98: @columbian_vac i knew people doing that in the real wrath days
[5:26:21] Moobot: rukiCool rukiBuddy rukiBuddy rukiBuddy rukiBuddy arielrp2602 WELCOME TO THE BUDDY CLUB! rukiBuddy rukiBuddy rukiBuddy rukiBuddy rukiBuddy rukiCool
[5:26:25] frankybllaze: THIS IS MY LAST RESORT !
[5:26:44] levit8TNG: Drainerx is online he played pally on cotnroller last season
[5:26:48] learningtogrowtogether: and 65s sorry. I haven’t been on in 8 years so I’m not even at 70
[5:26:58] sourbutts: @columbian_vac yeah you use like LT/L2 for like modifiers giving you way more buttons, or get a controller with paddles and rebind them to shift and control or something
[5:27:39] assrug: learningtogrowtogether have you considered mapping your keyboard so you can move with your index and using thumb as a modifier key and then using an mmo mouse?
[5:27:50] learningtogrowtogether: if I can use a controller to move I can still use the keyboard with my left hand
[5:28:06] SteLawBro: Looting and clicking on npc's, using the cursor in general was the only annoying part when i leveled with a controller. But that was like 10 years ago.
[5:28:19] columbian_vac: wtf i didnt know that was a thing now would kinda be fun to try
[5:28:39] learningtogrowtogether: @sarug only my thumb is really mobile
[5:29:08] SirBeaverTeeth: amazing
[5:29:15] assrug: learningtogrowtogether on left hadn?
[5:29:34] b_lappy: why don’t you spell steal pi when it was at full duration with no other buffs on dk towards the end
[5:29:42] learningtogrowtogether: @sarug my left hand is fine. my right is fucked
[5:29:45] sourbutts: @sarug you can ReBind the DPI buttons on a naga to ctrl/shift and that will give you 36 buttons just  on a naga
[5:29:59] learningtogrowtogether: lol left is fucked not right
[5:30:06] sourbutts: 39 if you include the wheel
[5:30:23] learningtogrowtogether: got caught in a serpentine belt on a car in my fingers went through the fan on the alternator
[5:30:32] assrug: i was gonna say - using a mouse with just two fingers doesn't seem that bad if you get a thumb button
[5:30:38] sourbutts: @learningtogrowtogether you could just use W on your left hand and just use a naga and play off of that only
[5:31:16] Somanie: I think w key + clicker + mouse turning would be alright
[5:31:54] sourbutts: @Somanie if he has a full right hand you can have 39 buttons on a naga, thats more than enough, you dont need to use a keyboard other than to run
[5:32:01] learningtogrowtogether: I just think a thumb stick to move would be a lot easier
[5:32:05] lostinfuzz: @venruki, what's your favorite color?
[5:32:26] supatease: the supasnowdrift tech
[5:32:45] zachgamegodx: it was actually absterge
[5:32:50] zachgamegodx: that quirky absterge
[5:32:58] assrug: learningtogrowtogether i mean if you just want a controller to move and still use mouse that shouldn't be too hard to setup
[5:32:58] dark_spearr: ven, random question but how the heck do you access the banner from cup 1?
[5:32:58] jawst3k: I think it was Soulja boy actually
[5:33:00] lostinfuzz: Me too!
[5:33:07] lostinfuzz: Not joking.
[5:33:10] sdotpuff: Yeah @jawst3k is right
[5:33:26] leeka: @dark_spearr i think they give them out really late
[5:33:27] learningtogrowtogether: it’s ok. getting the game next month so if I can’t use the gaming mouse il figure out a controller setup
[5:33:31] nikthevoker: isnt it in the toys?
[5:33:45] balboni69: lol

[5:33:55] assrug: learningtogrowtogether use a wii remote and a mouse, that will probably give you best results
[5:34:05] learningtogrowtogether: just looking for some recommendations. and thank you all for the help
[5:34:18] supatease: i made a giant batch of bacon and cheese wrapped tater tots thank you tik tok ads

[5:34:54] frofro00: drift
[5:34:54] Somanie: Shoooooooow
[5:34:59] g1loaded: How do one sign up for the cup?
[5:35:12] assrug: yeah you can, and since an mmo is probably ideal for right hand you could move with the thumbstick on wii remote i think its proably your best option
[5:35:15] marvin1995xo: @venruki why you never play feral ?
[5:35:17] ReApEr4O1: do you get to keep that title after the season ends?
[5:35:25] learningtogrowtogether: @supatease that sounds awesome
[5:35:31] ReApEr4O1: oh ok
[5:36:05] assrug: since wii remote is designed to be held in one hand
[5:36:20] learningtogrowtogether: @sarug I really appreciate that. that’s the best idea I’ve heard so far
[5:36:54] enzym666: damn, that music plus that character model
[5:37:02] FarvaWW: u guys ever be fartin when u paly wow and soemthing think omg that mite be poo

[5:39:58] numba9os: do u have it?
[5:41:07] learningtogrowtogether: last time I played they were still working on trans morphing gear
[5:41:40] assrug: @learningtogrowtogether you're welcome i just checked there is multiple options for a 1 handed joystic, the ones used for flight simulations even have buttons for thumb / index so you could maybe map those to jumping / modifiers
[5:42:34] WojoFog: frenzie proc
[5:42:38] numba9os: ven whats the weakaura for the avg wait time thing? or is it an addon
[5:42:39] TheNutcracka: it feels rlly nice to cyclone ppl tho LUL
[5:42:47] learningtogrowtogether: @sarug where do you find that information?  I did hear a flight stick would work
[5:42:56] hulkdieselx: feral seems like one of those specs where if u main it forever and get really good at it, its oppressive and strong. but anyone who "dabbles" just falls over dead lol
[5:42:59] leeka: i did frost demo last night at 2.2 and we got squashed
[5:43:11] learningtogrowtogether: lol
[5:43:14] nikthevoker: @venruki i asked my doctor a question and got the same response LUL

[5:43:22] numba9os: thxs
[5:44:00] leeka: we would have 10 min games vs other casters, then 1 min game vs dev dk
[5:44:00] assrug: learningtogrowtogether i'm software dev and used to work in robotics and had to deal with input mapping (for completely different reason) but it gives me enough insights to know whats possible
[5:44:46] chrisiirc: everyones playing shadow priest these days

[5:46:43] nikthevoker: jak has just played whatever spec is better, for pve in raid thats usually disc LUL
[5:46:54] Badasti: i dont really get this mentality today of 'nothing should ever bother me'. I think half the reason people are so angry is they are gaslit into thinking its abnormal to be annoyed sometimes

[5:48:05] chrisiirc: @Badasti yeah nowadays they victim blame. Like"you can only take offense if you allow yourself" its so disgusting
[5:48:29] assrug: @learningtogrowtogether no worries :)
[5:48:51] assrug: @blightclub i got laid off so probably not
[5:49:17] nikthevoker: that and people are actually insane online
[5:49:18] hulkdieselx: Ven any thoughts on how we could incentivize 3s ladder participation? Ladder has been absolutely ravaged by RSS this xpac it seems.
[5:49:18] Bigmoran: It really sucks trying to make stuff designed to help people, putting effort in care into your work, and then people trying to convince you that you are awful for doing so

[6:36:52] Mhortai: @Reizzy42 Gotta get them playing. I wish the AWC was advertised a little better. Back in the day with the paid tourney realm access (which was super fun) I feel like there were a ton of people when they did it that way.

[6:38:06] Kymagez: this
[6:38:08] strafekey: what did he say? I just hopped in
[6:38:10] Extramediums: why not both?

[6:38:41] PsyqoSupreme: is there some kind of "love" title? Babooshka, Mender of Broken Hearts feels appropriate
[6:38:51] Extramediums: you should ride a mechano strider
[6:38:55] flyingorangee: sick tmog tho
[6:38:56] Badasti: check 'Mechagon Mechanostrider' Ven

[6:40:33] Badasti: didnt used to, i used to run a guild with my bro and we got server firsts etc... But ever since they made multiple difficulties for the same raid i just got super bored
[6:40:37] Badasti: same shit over and over
[6:40:38] G4L4XY9: what do you think is going to happen with the awc comps following this past cup? Any teams going to adjust their comps, you think?

[6:40:59] Mhortai: @GamerKrown The most exciting part is the final boss kills. Most of it imo is pretty boring. Lots of down time and wipes.
[6:41:02] BigPatty123: @3KuLTV only 25s sadly, but im sorry i hurt you
[6:41:03] Spaceberry_McDuck: @3KuLTV lol, the hardest keys are sub 15s.

[7:22:50] wackpoetic: who would think that rukiHmm rukiDownGoes
[7:22:55] malvarcla: I like to do self imposed challenges like the no ice block challenge with only grey itmes

[7:29:25] Alerothan: @infernion THE MOVE
[7:29:44] infernion: Is DH really not meta/good on NA?
[7:29:46] Alerothan: pikabooMove

[7:29:49] Zarkos: cant believe this album turns 23 this year x.x
[7:30:12] FateIRL: they need to gut outlaw tankiness then itll be balanced
[7:30:20] Badasti: rogues were just as well represented in EU though I think, 21 sub and 21 outlaw or something vs 44 outlaw in the US
[7:30:21] infernion: Gonna be interesting next cup when Elswave joins Jaytis team, he's the best DH in EU, hope they play DH + WW KEKW

[7:33:58] Badasti: I've seen that name before as well, but not sure if its coz its just common spam or not
[7:34:22] FateIRL: its probably a booster who got banned
[7:35:30] code_rage: howton wasn't even doing DPS, just CCing thanks of course to the WW insane damage, Based on that dmg the best comp is a rogue doing CCs
[7:35:31] SquidSosa: i had a bot warlock yesteday it was insane. it was mugumbala and when he would port or gate he would just stand there until a player came to him

[7:39:12] Badasti: the way he jumps around on his target is also really suspicious, you wouldnt do that because you get rooted and when jumping you end up further away etc...
[7:39:20] Badasti: def doesn't move like someone who's good
[7:40:06] everlivingquinnviewer: hes a chad
