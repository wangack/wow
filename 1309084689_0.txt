[3:19:57] gritz_n_pitz: Glaivege
[3:20:00] Sofreshh: Faction balance is already fcked so I'm not sure why they don't want to do paid changes. Might be a technical limitation
[3:20:52] Sofreshh: Yeah I think it makes it much more fair. Then again they've never done it in retail so it seems like a big step
