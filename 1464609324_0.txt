[0:06:13] Whiskey_Corin: 👉 🥺 👈 Key is for me?
[0:06:17] Kinghorn: hello chat I am here to sniff some alpha keys 👃
[0:06:25] SwimsInLava: keys for what :O ?
[0:06:34] Kinghorn: keys to the kingdom
[0:06:43] MrGattz: beta keys for lost ark
[0:06:44] CplPunishr: i have jeep keys. will they do?
[0:06:50] banishtyrion: i think it's like 10 hours time difference from here (16:15)
[0:06:55] 91Niki: I have Legion beta keys if anyone wants Kappa
[0:07:02] CamVsGame: lost ark beta keys POGGERS
[0:07:03] Kinghorn: beta keys for mists of pandaria, whisper panda
[0:07:05] assman_ny: Morning H Squad
[0:07:30] banishtyrion: so it's 6 ish :D (apparently i'm bad at math)
[0:07:30] xendros78: ya'll got any of them warlord keys
[0:07:47] Kinghorn: best I can off is shadowlands beta keys xendros78
[0:07:56] Kinghorn: offer*
[0:07:57] xendros78: LUL
[0:08:07] CamVsGame: i only play WoD
[0:08:38] xendros78: warlords best expansion because of garrison housing
[0:08:45] Kinghorn: need to find me a WoD private server so I can sit in my garrison again
[0:09:10] banishtyrion: hype for WoD classic :D
[0:09:13] CamVsGame: everything in life is ok once i get inside my garrison
[0:09:23] Whiskey_Corin: Laughing @ all the housing fanbois who got shit on hahaa
[0:10:08] Molvonos: They didn't get shit on, they actually got information about Blizz's stance on housing and how they'd want to do it right.  which is more than the last ten years.
[0:10:09] CamVsGame: i think guild halls would be sick
[0:10:48] banishtyrion: honestly, housing doesn't seem that viable in wow ... it feels like a full housing zone wouldn't fit anywhere on azeroth
[0:10:49] Tokies: Yo :)
[0:10:53] vulkankragon: at what time does Ion Hazzikotas wake up?
[0:11:19] kokochris: he never sleeps
[0:11:25] MrGattz: 5:49am on the dot every morning
[0:12:03] xendros78: I'd love blizz to dedicate an entire patch to housing out of the blue and say the housing update took precedence over a new raid tier
[0:12:11] xendros78: the lol's would be legendary
[0:12:24] banishtyrion: LUL
[0:12:53] CamVsGame: yeah i think if your company can only work on raiding OR housing, it sucks lol
[0:13:03] CamVsGame: small indie company btw
[0:13:19] xendros78: LUL
[0:13:24] banishtyrion: even thinking about it it feels so off ... the timing is off, the experience from other MMOs is off, just dont
[0:13:45] MrGattz: yeah its not like it would ever just be one or the other.. the same team that makes raids probly doesnt or very rarely ever touches the base game functionality
[0:13:48] CamVsGame: honestly i dont think the engine can handle it or is built for that
[0:14:21] banishtyrion: "now you can put onyxia's head in your house"
[0:14:24] xendros78: oh I know, it would just be hilarious to see the teeth gnashing and PJSalt  production if Blizz did that, even as a joke
[0:14:28] CamVsGame: not trying to add a layer of broken shit lol
[0:14:52] CamVsGame: i installed retail last night
[0:14:55] MrGattz: the game engine is perfectly capable of doing housing. or anything for that matter
[0:14:58] banishtyrion: "mount it on a wall"
[0:15:09] MrGattz: its not the frostbite engine.
[0:15:26] CamVsGame: thats what they all say Gattz
[0:15:28] CamVsGame: lol
[0:15:42] xendros78: I get wow not having player housing, but I'm legit baffled by the fact they never added guild halls
[0:16:05] CamVsGame: ^
[0:17:23] MrGattz: would anyone ever use it? its the same as player housing but with more people. unless you take the time to build full fledged functional to it with decorations and so on theres no point in a blank space for you to only be with guildmates. they would add both at the same time or neither one of them.
[0:18:17] xendros78: people went back to GW1 just to complete content for stuff they could put in their GW2 guild halls
[0:18:17] wEiRdO_dUdE: A guild hall or guild ship would be great

[0:50:00] Relic7: @pacificmc1 You're smoking the good stuff KEKW
[0:50:02] jasperboy: no, this is NOT alpha
[0:50:03] Molvonos: No, this is Patrick.
[0:50:06] pacificmc1: @eldacal Yeah he's in the new Bastiona Shores zone
[0:50:13] pacificmc1: @Relic7 wait and see

[0:50:17] CYNIC308: yea in my eyes its looking like WotLK is early September and Pre-patch is late December
[0:50:26] Relic7: @pacificmc1 That timeline makes zero sense.
[0:50:33] pacificmc1: @Relic7 sure
[0:51:00] ConstructedX: it wil come out when it comes out :)
[0:51:16] CYNIC308: SOOOON™
[0:51:19] Relic7: @pacificmc1 They always release on the last month of a quarter because it bumps both quarters up. Therefore, November makes no sense, if it was going to be this year it would be December... If Alpha is not until next month or month after, Beta is not until the Summer, pre-patch December, release in Spring 2023
[0:51:43] pacificmc1: @Relic7 yeah sure :)
[0:51:51] Leggo_Saiyan: Defo not coming out until 2023
[0:51:55] WhiteKnight74648: has anyone been experience insanely large que times in LA?
[0:52:28] Warrstein: Yes Large queue times because new content + weekend is what i'm assuming
[0:53:00] Eviltuna13: Wrath later this yera will hold over people till mid 2023 for DF to come out
[0:53:04] WhiteKnight74648: @Warrstein agreed people are coming back but even at launch it wasn't this excessive. 12k + on Valtan last night. 7K this morning.
[0:53:20] pacificmc1: Wrath is coming September 20th.
[0:53:38] chrslp: @Relic7 Only 2 expansions in the history of wow have released in the last month of a quarter
[0:54:00] Eviltuna13: ill put the next expansion at March 2023
[0:54:22] pacificmc1: Pre-patch is Nov 8. Release Nov 22.

[1:05:09] jasperboy: @Kinghorn 1000 bucks and their yours
[1:05:09] magiccanvashands: @Towelliee did you see the top 7 stocks Elon Musk is looking to aquire?  Activision Blizzard (NASDAQ was at the top of his list for this quarter.
[1:05:21] PrimalRain: Niksen_99 feel like you should know fairly early
[1:05:25] PvtHudson093: I cant wait for wowhead to have a talent calculator up
[1:05:28] wEiRdO_dUdE: A big beta, then an open beta would be great
[1:05:32] chrslp: only alpha I ever got in was Wrath and idk how I got flagged tbh
[1:05:35] Kinghorn: LUL

[1:06:09] captiv8: So what day are you allowed to tell us you have an alpha key sitting in your email?
[1:06:38] onous_: @towelliee what's good pimpin?
[1:06:41] chrslp: I seem to also remember one of the Alpha builds leaked ages ago and you could make an offline private server and explore in it LUL
[1:06:42] Niksen_99: Thanks :D Its just if end game is more fun than the early game @PrimalRain
[1:06:43] Eviltuna13: I got lucky i got into every Beta so far. think ill play this one

[1:07:17] Dogjah: I used to get into Alpha and beta all the time back in the day until streaming become a thing lol.
[1:07:18] nightmayor12: lvl 57 was when I replaced my first piece
[1:07:21] PrimalRain: Niksen_99 it's a little more fun, but to me wasn't a drastic change.
[1:07:29] CritcobainTV: According to bruv night you're basically in your late 50s LUL
[1:07:43] CritcobainTV: how is moonlight? i was gonna start it

[1:09:34] xsveninatorx: wife and i are trying out that Outer Range show on Amazon with Josh Brolin, kinda slow first episode but we'll see where it goes

[1:10:01] CritcobainTV: Unfortunately your first playthrough you have to swap covenant abilities, you don't get to keep kyrian the whole time
[1:10:16] Kinghorn: the beginning of the expansion was a blur of 24 hour leveling
[1:10:42] Niksen_99: Im watching Better Call Saul for the second time....
[1:10:44] dephius: !ui

[1:10:47] IianaDRK: @Towelliee sorry if i missed u saying already, but thoughts on interupts being removed as baseline abilities and made into talents?
[1:10:48] FR4NCO: @Gibsonex  same...the thought of doing torghast again...my god help us all.
[1:11:06] mmrghost7: do u think we will see talent preview for all specs anytime soon ?
[1:11:11] INTHELAVA: @Niksen_99 Quality show, just started S6
[1:11:32] Mibd2010: good morning
[1:11:46] Eggz1004: whats your /played time so far @Towelliee
[1:11:47] IianaDRK: i dont hate the idea of it
[1:12:00] reggiepowa: its interrupt vs another utility
[1:12:04] Ortinoth: i really hope they don't make interupt talent based
[1:12:10] IianaDRK: if its the choice between other utility then im interested in what they do
[1:12:14] Niksen_99: Really is :D enjoy! @INTHELAVA
[1:12:22] mavericks312: honestly as a mage we never use poly anymore so take it away for all i care lol
[1:12:28] 91Niki: I'm thinking it's maybe a passive for quicker CD or extra charges @Towelliee
[1:12:35] HentzGG: Do you think they will stop allowing addons like DBM?
[1:12:45] CYNIC308: talent into a 3rd interrupt for tanks and a 2nd for all other classes probably
[1:12:51] PvtHudson093: Hoping Final Verdict the legendary  for Rat makes it into the talents
[1:12:52] Dogjah: agreed
[1:12:56] Eviltuna13: I hope Animal Companion becomes base line
[1:12:57] Ortinoth: i am not sure i like the class and spec talent trees ---
[1:13:11] Warrstein: I guess if you're in a raid and you only need 2 kicks then the other guys can swap it out for more power
[1:13:19] Ortinoth: it should be like classic trees one tree for each spec
[1:13:19] Dogjah: cant have enough interupts
[1:13:26] lithium364: just add dark simulacrum for dks back into pve 4Head
[1:13:41] Mortiie_: All the casuals wont addons removed its so odd
[1:13:43] luckfore: just done use them 4Head
[1:13:51] Youredoneson666: they need to remove combat addons.
[1:13:59] NBK_Sethus: they should be, they're turning the game into brain dead robotic experience and meta is forcing them upon everyone
[1:14:01] faulen: built in WA's would be insane
[1:14:01] Dimeric: Addons should stay, but the game nees to be more playable without them.
[1:14:03] Kneckt: True
[1:14:05] stratiss: they should 100% do that if they are going to continue to design around weakauras
[1:14:10] Kneckt: I’d love built in adding
[1:14:11] KaptnG: @towelliee do you think they will lift more race/combo restrictions?  Like Undead Paladins?
[1:14:13] raye_gaming22: @Youredoneson666 you need to be removed lol
[1:14:14] Kneckt: Addons
[1:14:21] FR4NCO: think DBM should be allowed but thats just me..
[1:14:24] yaellian: I want them to add controller support to the same state that FFXIV has it.
[1:14:36] Hitokiri83: u need to ring 5 bells around the zone to spawn the rare
[1:14:36] bosscoffee_: @Dimeric agreed, a games design should not hinge on the use of third party addons, thats just unintuitive bad design
[1:14:44] duffluv22: Bruv night was funny...lol
[1:14:46] Dogjah: I alwasy thought it would be awesome if Blizzard would work with the addon developers somehow...
[1:14:46] Youredoneson666: @Youredoneson666 found the person who doesn't actually LEARN mechanics and just watches the addon tell you.
[1:14:48] superluboss: dbm should be build into the game not an addon
[1:15:11] FR4NCO: ya for sure
[1:15:15] CYNIC308: why cant Dragonkin  melee tho?
[1:15:16] Everbliss: @Towelliee how hard is it to get into the low-key mythic+ scene in WoW. never done a Mythic+ in my wow life and I want to start now. any tips?
[1:15:18] Wcvechten: That sounded like a very He Knows laugh 🤔
[1:15:18] PvtHudson093: Give it one expac and Dragons will be other classes
[1:15:20] xirangeix: Man my #1 desire for new xpac is probably account wide things like rep, tmogs (if u get a cloth and can equip cloth then you get it whether or not its your main stat), and other character based stuff
[1:15:34] yaellian: True
[1:15:42] Funderik: that's just a case of blizzard gives us something cool and players always wanting more, there's no end to that treadmill
[1:15:43] Brookish_: I want a Dracthyr warrior so bad D:
[1:15:44] HentzGG: People are hating on the dragon race. But I’m excited as hell to check them out
[1:15:52] Brodih_: people are making up excuses to make YT videos to bitch about something and hopping to get views
[1:15:56] PokerFaceMoose: they said they arent adding more race/class combos yet in one of the interviews
[1:15:59] mmrghost7: as a tank player i dont like to play the new class
[1:16:01] FR4NCO: gonna be nothing but the new class running around for awhile
[1:16:04] KaptnG: I’m pumped for Dragonflight but I’ve been wanting an Undead Paladin for quite some time
[1:16:05] ConstructedX: agreed
[1:16:06] Polebegood: idk, demon hunter is essentially one race locked per faction
[1:16:17] Joneeeez: who has keys?, you probably are the first ones that get a alpha key towelliee =), I'm excited for gameplay if its not NDA ofc..
[1:16:23] CYNIC308: how the hell do you make a DRAGON class/race and not a melee spec? LUL
[1:16:36] Funderik: no matter what blizzard do add or change players will be like "that's cool but can we have.... aswel?"
[1:16:36] Alexkayzz: Do you have a goal for 9to5?
[1:16:48] Eviltuna13: @KaptnG Welcomes to the Gnome Paladin Club

[1:17:51] pavepawns: coming soon TM
[1:17:54] WhiteKnight74648: Gnome paladins can't reach the light
[1:17:56] DE_Declan: @Towelliee Have any thoughts on something Inspired by DnD "Multiclass";  - Option to choose two classes and have half the power of each in one class E.g. Warrior + Mage = Eldrich knight
[1:17:57] audr3y_lol: oi! back for some wow! looking forward to jump back in. They did say that the new UI was to improve new player experience since the UI is so damned outdated.
[1:17:58] DallTV_: gnomes pallyu i quit the game instant

[1:34:37] faulen: since Cata
[1:34:37] EpicBananners: cata
[1:34:40] emozombiemonkey: Do we have specifics on how the crossfaction play is going to work for guilds, etc.? Do you have to like do a quest to chose to be on the opposite faction?
[1:34:44] KingRevoker: @Biotechz I slowly started getting used to it, but every time I see someone without it, It just bugged me all over again haha
[1:34:49] HentzGG: That’s what I think most people want. Back to bases
[1:34:56] EpicBananners: ok, cata was a big reset i guess
[1:35:01] jhm89: Legion best xpac

[1:36:14] Aidler: yeah, I thougt "10.0" would be special and not only a normal expansion
[1:36:16] Grim_Kibishii: I would have preferred no new zone, and had a reason to come back to OG Zones
[1:36:17] HentzGG: I think people want that. Not crazy new systems
[1:36:35] Gingerprimer: And that the dungeons are great
[1:36:35] Niksen_99: I think its because the first couple of weeks of a new expansion is so fun no matter how the game turns out
[1:36:39] Eviltuna13: @luckfore I enjoy WQ
[1:36:44] Dein95: i wonder if they'll bring back emissaries
[1:36:49] Garsto: most of the reveal was vague but enough info that says theres good change
[1:36:50] KingRevoker: @Biotechz One of the reasons I love twitch, someone helps me out I can usually find a way to return the favor haha
[1:36:54] Ortinoth: i am sure world quests will still be there
[1:36:57] apollobaker: @Towelliee which expansion you were the most hyped for before release?
[1:37:12] Devital: They did say they want to incentivize world pvp better in the Bajheera interview didnt they @Towelliee
[1:37:13] Baron_Pandacula: i hope they dont re add shadowlands world quests and instead give us legion/bfa world quests back
[1:37:35] EmpathyLiveChat: Patch timing seems important too
[1:37:38] MrGattz: world quest 3.0 boys!
[1:37:41] Clicklesly: The way they're talking about it, they really don't want to tie anything that's actual player power to account :-I

They have an excellent 24/7 support team, supreme pc build quality and your PC will arrive at your house in a wooden crate!
[1:38:51] TheUnknowing: i think world quest and stuff are kind of a given, they just need to find a way to make them meaningful again
[1:38:56] Aidler: no wq would be bad
[1:38:58] luckfore: zones are finally connected again too, much better than the long ass flight in SL
[1:38:59] dracullus: systems were invented so people have stuff to do, but since then cosmetic side of game expanded a lot especially in SL
[1:38:59] 91Niki: I wanna go back to the old emissary system from BFA.
[1:39:09] PvtHudson093: bring back the kill one mob style world quests
[1:39:09] Eviltuna13: I think Blizz finally figured it out that there player base doesn't have a ton of play time now a days
[1:39:12] fewyn: kind of like assaults?
[1:39:16] fewyn: or the legion invasions?
[1:39:18] N3llee: @91Niki fuck no plz
[1:39:21] Baron_Pandacula: i just want kill 10 monkeys world quests back, and less 4 step world quests that take forever
[1:39:32] luckfore: @91Niki same
[1:39:36] PokerFaceMoose: honestly sometimes there are so many things to do as a normal player its so hard to try and get everything i want to do
[1:39:42] 91Niki: @N3llee It's literally the same as now without having to pick up the quest dummy LUL
[1:39:47] MrGattz: @N3llee whats the difference between the old way and the new way that you hate? its the same thing with a different name lol
[1:39:49] stratiss: I'd like to see them try their hand at GW2 style events with profession mats/gold/rep as rewards
[1:39:50] Clicklesly: So like the Maw lieutenants? Or whatever those were ^^
[1:39:58] KingSlayerYotam: Mechagon style bar, with easy legion style WQ
[1:39:59] luckfore: callings are a step back from emissaries
[1:40:01] apollobaker: @Towelliee what are you thinking about no lfg in lich king classic?
[1:40:09] Forrestra: As long as ALL periodic quests are often enough that doesn't punish me for working a night shift.
[1:40:27] PokerFaceMoose: on the one hand if its ONE thing thats okay, but if its like 40 options thats way too many
[1:40:32] fewyn: more regularly scheduled mini0events basically
[1:40:38] dracullus: @luckfore they are 10x better, only shitty part is that you have to pick up quest (which should be corrected next expac)
[1:40:41] NickLeonhearth: Poundfist waiting groups like back in WoD
[1:40:51] N3llee: @91Niki the paragon system and endless rep grind for rewards, xmog mounts extc... that system needs to go back to diablo.. its a terrible system
[1:41:06] HentzGG: I want them to get rid of the time gated things too that don’t require 5 days of “research”
[1:41:21] HentzGG: That require*
[1:41:46] 91Niki: @N3llee I don't think they will get rid of it. I am just saying, if they are gonna keep it. please make it like BFA, so we don't have to pick up quests for it and can just do wqs and get progression towards it
[1:41:50] N3llee: #1 thing I am excited about new xpac. NO MISSION TABLE
[1:42:06] SilkeySmooth: no lfd not buying a boost
[1:42:08] PidiaP: You save Nikolan in the Necrolord part of the 9.1 campaign and he helps you in the Kyrian part of 9.1 @towelliee
[1:42:08] mmrghost7: no lfg will make leveling wrath so frustrating
[1:42:26] dracullus: it's make loot matter all over again
[1:42:27] Zettabyte: towOny towOny towOny towOny towOny
[1:42:28] Niksen_99: Kinda like no world buffs in SOM.. Majority is talking and now the game is dead LUL
[1:42:32] Kize_Gaming: I just really hope they add faction changing to WOTLK classic
[1:42:35] luckfore: are they gonna add more to wotlk? thougt it was gonna be huge lol @Towelliee
[1:42:37] Phalamore: I am fine with no LFG at max level, but it was kinda fun to spam dungeons on alts when leveling up
[1:42:39] KaisenSiru: @N3llee There better be a table mission. Easiest way to make gold and get free mats.
[1:42:52] N3llee: you are wrong

[1:43:38] Zolshy89: after 3 xpacs?
[1:43:40] darssia_: I like mission tables.....
[1:43:43] AveragePvp: Good, table is such an easy way to make gold
[1:43:45] dianthusnemo: mission table is a great way to farm stuff fast and without hazzle
[1:43:45] KaisenSiru: @N3llee I make nearly 500k gold from AHing the mats I get from the bags across 12 alts that do the table.
[1:43:48] pavepawns: I WANT MY TABLE
[1:43:50] N3llee: mission table is terrible

[1:44:01] HentzGG: There it is. LEAKED!!
[1:44:10] Sir_Cranium: dont yall hate when you make them freezer fries and they come out all soggy instead of crispy towCry towCry
[1:44:17] Reckless_Monk: WoD was the best
[1:44:20] MILESkg21: why would people complain about free gold KEKW
[1:44:20] dracullus: mission table for wrath classic #somechanges

[1:54:08] CYNIC308: it was more grindy than most asian mmos ... what did they expect Wildstar tried to hide a lack of content behind a HUGE grind
[1:54:08] Youredoneson666: BDO KEKW
[1:54:13] IianaDRK: i played it till its death FeelsBadMan
[1:54:18] ArcaneSyntax: wildstar died because they didn't have a paladin class

[1:56:05] harris243124: Alpha keys coming!

[2:52:31] Rakish44: the gnomes will finally get their chance
[2:52:39] Sledgecore: kill him off
[2:52:41] OGXanos: Andy steps down, Turalyon steps in and goes Zelot, Andy and Sylv bond in the maw and buddy up to save stormwind. there you go 11.x
[2:52:43] CritcobainTV: poor anduin has PTSD Sadge

[2:52:48] Layercake: And the fact he banged Sylvanas didn't helped Kappa
[2:52:52] itjustfeelsright: sounds like LOTR where they have the scars from the ring they have to leave the land
[2:52:52] Alepouditsa: yea i don't like him or jenna
[2:52:57] tomcruise210: hes just such a baby compared to who we got with Varian
[2:52:59] Tanaros: He'll prob disappear for a bit then come back like Jana did
[2:53:00] chinfu303: nah he retired his done with our characters bullshit
[2:53:01] darssia_: I think we like Anduin, he just doesn't really fit as king.
[2:53:10] CritcobainTV: I think Sylvanas just rode the life and willpower out of Anduin 100%
[2:53:45] tomcruise210: yea i like anduin i just think he needs some time away lol sylvanas can stay gone
[2:53:53] chaotikz7: @Critcobain If they were married this would make total sense
[2:53:54] datcreepa: he has no need for vengance
[2:54:04] theSalute: gratss
[2:54:12] IianaDRK: Clap

[2:56:32] Alastree: Hey Towelliee
[2:56:45] falldrgn: Deathwing is coming back...
[2:56:47] OGXanos: NOPE done, dragon isles were unreachable
[2:56:53] kingcharlesthe100: i clicked on this for a second and thought it was a religous reading lol
[2:57:43] falldrgn: imean towliee is wow Jesus
[2:58:07] swordart2022: Flowers blooming is Azeroth you Pepega
[2:58:08] MILESkg21: KEKW
[2:58:11] tomcruise210: STONEY SOPRANO KEKW
[2:58:15] Armdel: I figured it was to show that the island was waking up again
[2:58:20] ArcaneSyntax: @Towelliee that was Taliesin's theory too
[2:58:22] luckfore: yea the dragons where near and stonebro had to open the way
[2:58:25] OGXanos: also we never fought chromatus so it's already off
[2:58:51] timmythegamertv: But the problem was, that the dragon isles was hidden and it's been 10k years, Alexstraza and other dragon aspects would have flown over that area without knowing.. Something else is happening
[2:59:02] tomcruise210: ebonhorn should be Aspect of the black dragonflight
[2:59:08] pavepawns: was this before or after the cinematic?
[2:59:08] Melonbrew: T & E thinks it's the elementals gaining power since Tyr was the one that defeated Ragnaros and got the elements under control. Or something like that.
[2:59:11] Eraste: chromatus is puppeting the primus to protect us from what is to come NODDERS
[2:59:12] timmythegamertv: Wait Wrathion vs whatever the highmountain tauren person is..
[2:59:13] falldrgn: well the titans\watchers hid it
[2:59:37] Armdel: the Dragons should have known it existed and where it was, they just had no reason to be there i guess
[2:59:51] Armdel: and the watcher was just to keep others beside the dragons out
[2:59:56] pavepawns: @Armdel it hid the lands from the dragons aswell
[3:00:02] timmythegamertv: wait former aspect of time?
[3:00:08] timmythegamertv: He's alive just no powers right?
[3:00:25] Nico_vdM: The aspects gave up their aspect powers to defeat Deathwing
[3:00:35] timmythegamertv: But to be fair, aren't majority of the aspects all MIA?
[3:00:49] MILESkg21: Aspects are Mortals now
[3:00:52] CritcobainTV: The aspects are less MIA than my dad FeelsBadMan
[3:00:54] The_Kayson: tabbed <3 {beautiful person detected}
[3:01:05] IianaDRK: tyr is long dead
[3:01:06] Molvonos: I have a feeling that when the aspects were drained of their power, Nozdormu's corruption-bad end can be circumvented.
[3:01:07] tomcruise210: danuser said that wasnt tyr tho
[3:01:10] OGXanos: nope, Ty is buried...it TYRisfall
[3:01:22] theDirtyon3: possibly yeah
[3:01:26] d1stract10n: RAG again
[3:01:26] tomcruise210: plz no
[3:01:28] MILESkg21: Raggy FeelsGoodMan

[3:01:35] ArcaneSyntax: rag is super dead too
[3:01:36] PvtHudson093: raggy 3.0
[3:01:38] Molvonos: Nah, we killed Ragnaros on the plane of fire.  He's dead dead.
[3:01:39] pavepawns: tyr is dead so is rag
[3:01:39] CritcobainTV: Ragnaros again? KEKW
[3:01:42] OGXanos: Tyr is omega dead
[3:01:42] Armdel: looked dead in the cinematic atleast
[3:01:43] ArcaneSyntax: there's literally a new firelord
[3:01:47] elbinn: if we got KT 3 times we deserve rag a third KEKW
[3:01:50] pavepawns: both tyr and rag are confirmed lore dead
[3:01:50] CushyPop: Rag will be a thing
[3:01:50] bigoldmeatpie: you won't into his tomb back in legion for the artifact
[3:01:50] CrunkyBrewster: Rag coming back with Pants
[3:01:50] IianaDRK: he was killed and buried in tirisfal glades. u go to his tomb for some of the legion artifacts
[3:01:52] theDirtyon3: there is alot of other elemental lords too
[3:01:54] Molvonos: Shaman Order Hall put a new Fire elemental as Lord.
[3:01:54] StoicTaurus: It was confirmed, that our first enemy are "Elemental Dragons"
[3:01:55] Taz_85: Tyr died in tirisfall, right?
[3:02:00] Wcvechten: I bellieve there was a shaman quest where they were fighting over a new lord of fire

[3:03:13] LazyTitanSage: Can a mod link me the article we are reading?
[3:03:16] Molvonos: Ehhhhh.... C'Thun is dead-dead  too.  Between what we did and what's in the book.  @Towelliee

[3:04:02] MILESkg21: the shrooms mustve kicked in here 4Head
[3:04:14] CritcobainTV: this xpac sounds like a dope acid trip for sure
[3:04:29] CrunkyBrewster: no shot
[3:04:33] MILESkg21: NO SHOT

[3:04:41] OGXanos: nope, can't kill old gods
[3:04:43] pavepawns: cthun is dead dead
[3:04:45] Molvonos: This dude clearly has a boner for cthun, despite the fact that the giant eyeball's dead.
[3:04:45] CrunkyBrewster: nah they're not gonna sacrifice Wrath
[3:04:49] wisplingz: robot c'thun

[3:05:25] itjustfeelsright: I thought they said the pre expansion event was going to take place around uldaman
[3:05:43] Kneckt: Anyone got link
[3:05:53] ArcaneSyntax: did he mention galakrond?
[3:05:59] CrunkyBrewster: right LUL
[3:06:01] tomcruise210: and ebonhorn taking the Aspect role
[3:06:08] Jokervenom1978: Wrathion is a douchelord
[3:06:09] dan_monk: Did I miss your predicted release date you normally do btw?
[3:06:09] pavepawns: the issue is we know that the elemental dragons follow galakronds ideals and wants him back
[3:06:11] OGXanos: Its like this guy wrote a fanfic and threw tons of established lore out the window
[3:06:12] Wcvechten: The Silithid did kinda recover superfast after the sword stabbed Silithus,  who says Azerite juice doesn't do a dead god some good
[3:06:15] MILESkg21: he had me in the first half.. not gonna lie KEKW
[3:06:16] CrunkyBrewster: sounds that guy hates Wrathion
[3:06:24] Molvonos: Galakrond is dead dwead.
[3:06:24] IianaDRK: its interesting but yeh tyr is already dead and cthun was already confirmed dead dead
[3:06:26] CritcobainTV: i just ate too much dairy queen, im about to be dead dead
[3:06:30] pavepawns: galakrond is dead dead but can be resurrected
[3:06:37] fewyn: is anyone really ever dead with an Aspect of Time being involved?
[3:06:41] ArcaneSyntax: Galakrond was filled with death magic and they were trying to revive him in dragonblight
[3:06:44] imAskja: no one is ever really dead dead after Shadowlands
[3:06:57] Antoinas: isnt it just yhsaarj left?
[3:07:00] ArcaneSyntax: and they've recently updated his death site in the game files.
[3:07:00] CrunkyBrewster: Arthas is pretty much dead dead dead
[3:07:00] Orthobullet: Galakrond raid
[3:07:07] TheGcsmith: Isn't Twilight Hammer involved in Ulduman? the reworked dungeon for the prepatch?
[3:07:15] swinkeh: if someone dies we just take a portal to SL and can have a chat
[3:07:22] MILESkg21: the Heart in Siege
[3:07:23] theDirtyon3: titans killed him
[3:07:25] Kinghorn: ysharj was yeeted into space
[3:07:29] rauko_64: @Towelliee that comic was trash and they scrubed it since they made medivhs son a god
[3:07:36] chinfu303: yhsaarj took a massive L
[3:07:43] 91Niki: Dead dead, like Wildstar dead dead? sacHMM
[3:07:50] TheGcsmith: Ysharahj is dead dead, the last of his power consumed by Garrosh
[3:07:52] CritcobainTV: Too soon @91Niki
[3:07:58] CrunkyBrewster: The only thing that tends to remain from Old Gods are like they're essences. Like how we got Shas and such
[3:08:05] Eraste: battlefield 2042 dead dead?
[3:08:06] MILESkg21: no dead dead like CNN+ KEKW
[3:08:11] TheEmperor30k: Dead until sub numbers fall
[3:08:14] imAskja: finality of characters is a retcon I'd actually like to see
[3:08:20] Jigsawzz: CNN--
[3:08:23] theDirtyon3: CNN+ KEKW
[3:08:26] CritcobainTV: What is dead may never die
[3:08:26] Molvonos: Problem is that people are taking what the Titans said about the Old gods as gospel truth.  Titans are clearly fallible too.
[3:08:31] CritcobainTV: I learned that one from game of thrones
[3:08:37] 91Niki: More like CNN-
[3:08:38] CrunkyBrewster: paying for CNN KEKWDISCO
[3:08:50] MILESkg21: was it too soon 4Head
[3:08:50] wisplingz: we need twilight devastation back
[3:08:55] Molvonos: They saw what Y'Shaarj did to Azeroth and expected them all to do the same thing, instead of us acting like antibodies and burning the old gods to death from the inside.
[3:09:02] Mattsta: i always took it as like ticks/misquitos, where you have to deal with the in a certain way or they are bad for you...and the titans just ripping them out was the bad way
[3:09:13] chinfu303: GIVE US TWILIGHT DEV BACk
[3:09:13] Moobot: towHAMUP Follow Towelliee on twitter so you can be in the know at all times! | twitter.com/towelthetank towKawaii
[3:09:17] SonofHorus82: old gods CAN die, but the titans learned that they were so deep into Azeroth that then dying would destroy the planet. When Aman'thul tore Y'sharjj out of the planet it created the well of eternity, so they know that killing the old gods would be no bueno.
[3:09:42] BuzzCutBronson: what does alpha got sniffed mean
[3:09:48] LazyTitanSage: I like to think it’s their spirits are bound to their realm of origin.  Demons die in the twisting nether.  Elementals die on their plane.  Old gods die in the void.

[3:11:24] arturiuss44: Probably late to comment but just read Tera is shutting down another MMPORG bites the dust.

[3:13:29] mavericks312: the eventual sylvanas return

[3:13:46] rauko_64: what has malfurion been doing while his wife is missing?
[3:13:46] Dathas487: @Wcvechten Hopeful at some point they'll get a return. A lot of missed opportunity there imo
[3:13:58] SonofHorus82: what's his name from Drustvar never got taken care of either.

[3:16:24] FranciscoTheMage: @Towelliee so the new expac isn't really bringing us back to Azeroth.. well be off somewhere else not on kalimdor or Eastern kingdoms
[3:16:46] Molvonos: @FranciscoTheMage Azeroth is the planet.
[3:16:46] MILESkg21: its a new part of AZ
[3:16:51] Kneckt: @franciscothemage Azeroth is still planet
[3:16:53] fyre97_: we are still in azeroth

[3:22:44] Sam_Nash: @fyreboy97 thank you!

[3:23:06] Malvurak9109: @towelliee what modes do you play in mlb the show?

[3:23:32] Dirtnose: im in triple A but im a SP so games take like 10-15mins lol
[3:23:38] DeanoTV: 9.2.5 and S4
[3:23:38] Karbonn: I really really want Dragonflight to hit it out of the park. I'm hoping removing the shared power helps. Talent trees coming back is huge, I missed that.
[3:23:44] joe_g_433: @towelliee were you surprised to see an “alpha” already?
[3:23:49] 91Niki: No one said he can ONLY play wow until 10.0 alpha comes out LUL
[3:23:53] Nightmaares: in the mood to play wow for the first time in years after the announcements
[3:24:12] dan_monk: Alpha end of May prob
[3:24:14] dan_monk: just prep
[3:24:28] Armdel: only 6?
[3:24:28] LeXieSterling: It's like the song. It's your birthday we're going to play WOW like's it's your Brithday and we don't give a ..xxx it's not expansion day. Lolo
[3:24:29] pavepawns: so will you try out the evoker?
[3:24:46] pavepawns: will you try out evoker or be absorbed by the talent tree
[3:24:57] luckfore: think they gonna go the DH style route
[3:25:02] OGXanos: gonna be  shit tons of talent tree testing for months
[3:25:06] ZooNamiii: do streamers get Alpha ?
[3:25:06] Dreadscore: is there any way to import Arkinventory profile?
[3:25:21] zgag: Be interesting to see if Blizzard does this Alpha/Beta differently than in the past. Blizzard really needs this xpac to be a hit . Imo, if they go towards more of a marketing test not much will have changed.
[3:25:23] MILESkg21: 24hr stream just for Talent Trees Kreygasm
[3:25:27] luckfore: thats what they did in legion
[3:25:27] FranciscoTheMage: so regular people cant possible be in the alpha? you have to be an insider?
[3:25:42] Rottencoarse: @MilesKG21 make it happen!!
[3:26:01] mmrghost7: i can be blizzard's family :P
[3:26:12] tulsaboom: @towelliee what Combat WA is that?
[3:26:20] Sledgecore: can u stream alpha like beta?
[3:26:23] Alienfromger: are one of them?
[3:26:34] rauko_64: i was in BFA alpha
[3:27:13] zgag: Alpha use to never be streamed and or seen on a content creator platform.  (NDA stuff).  They changed that with more of a marketing approach
[3:27:21] Crowargus: wonder if i can get veteren inv been playing since wrath now lol
[3:27:27] cosmothug: what do you focus on during testing
[3:27:32] MILESkg21: towUp towPog
[3:27:34] MistaHat: Have you played any expansion before Shadowlands? Kappa
[3:27:36] choppu31: How can i apply to test alpha?
[3:27:37] fred_birkhoff: you can only stream alpha if you are alpha
[3:27:44] joe_g_433: Going to be a good summer , watching alpha gameplay and getting hyped.
[3:27:55] lithium364: nda for alpha was always stupid there was always these one russian streamer streaming it anyway
[3:27:57] SilkeySmooth: how are you liking survival hunter?
[3:28:21] MILESkg21: or running up a mountain KEKW
[3:28:26] Incredible_Sausage: there's still 2 holes in the map of the cata twilight area
[3:28:35] The_Tacozilla: official rock inspector
[3:28:39] SonofHorus82: super interested to see the profession testing.
[3:28:49] FranciscoTheMage: lol
[3:28:49] rauko_64: or finding mobs that spawn way too fast
[3:28:52] KatieGaming: lol
[3:28:53] theDirtyon3: rock is a rock YEP
[3:28:55] HaxzorJimDuggan: giant sword bug still in silithus Kappa
[3:29:01] PotatoWin: i was entertained
[3:29:01] CloudPants8081: cooksuXchamp
[3:29:01] joe_g_433: Hahahah
[3:29:08] cosmothug: hahaha
[3:29:09] MILESkg21: HaxzorJimDuggan what sword
[3:29:13] Ashbuu: what made you choose surv hunter?
[3:29:15] FranciscoTheMage: towPog
[3:29:16] Alienfromger: was exiting tho LUL
[3:29:20] timmythegamertv: But to be fair they aren't expecting streamers, friends and family participants to go to that level @Towelliee that's what actual QA Testers are for..
[3:29:50] ArcaneSyntax: I usually just level and fill out bug reports for the stuff I see.
[3:29:55] Sam_Nash: rock stream danGachi danGachi
[3:30:07] ArcaneSyntax: There was a bug in the BFA beta where my characters arms disappeared.
[3:30:27] timmythegamertv: Welcome to dev life..
[3:30:46] ijuki: I did send in a lot of feedback on the Exile reach test
[3:30:49] Ambelz: I try my best to break through the map at most places during alpha/beta. Been invited to most beta's and a lot of alphas since wrath
[3:30:55] ArcaneSyntax: I had to talk to a GM in game for them to find a bug in the Legion Shaman campaign.
[3:30:57] Velashen: They are usually several builds past any beta people are playing.
[3:30:59] timmythegamertv: You'd have first hand experience with that @Towelliee didn't you do QA for a company?
[3:31:04] Celestia6: the bug I will always remember was coming out of the dalaran bank and falling through the floor
[3:31:28] zgag: There was so much feed-back from the community during beta for SL that went onto death's ears. Hopefully that will change for 10.0
[3:31:30] PirateX84: Expansion mode - best way to describe it xD
[3:31:37] MILESkg21: Shamans still exist ? KEKW
[3:32:03] luckfore: nzoth upside down in 8.3 was fun KEKW
[3:32:07] ijuki: @MilesKG21 Shamans are fine Kappa

[3:32:24] MILESkg21: dawww FeelsGoodMan
[3:32:25] cabalish: towLove
[3:32:25] HaxzorJimDuggan: streamer streamer check that rock it looks odd Kappa
[3:32:27] itjustfeelsright: i feel too many want into beta just to see if they will buy the expansion or not
[3:32:28] Cafe0le: arent we like 4 months away from alpha or somehting
[3:32:30] mmrghost7: i actually dont want alpha or beta dont wanna kill the wonder element for myself
[3:32:30] KShellZx: honestly watching you play WoW makes me want ot play woW lol
[3:32:40] zgag: Blizzard used testing for marketing and didn't listen to the feedback. If that changes for 10.0 then we know we got something going
[3:32:44] isurprises: Is there anything I could do now to prep for the new class, new healer class I have to jam hard
[3:32:45] MILESkg21: oops i meant Elemental Shamans KEKW
[3:32:47] abracka_: ele shaman is fucking wild
[3:32:50] Pey0: every shaman spec is good rn
[3:32:53] swervo61: So is leveling going to be similar to SL like horde and alliance don’t get split up?
[3:32:54] Collected1: Only here for the keys.
[3:33:00] headninja1ncharge: Ench wrecks
[3:33:01] Tokies: been waiting YEARS for the enchantment shaman to be popping off like it has been.

[3:33:21] Collected1: Collected1 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 105 months! Only here for the keys.
[3:33:24] Molvonos: 4pc, 2 leggo Ehn shaman is fucking gross.
[3:33:29] MILESkg21: 105 years of keys towPog
[3:33:30] Molvonos: dogs for dasys
[3:33:32] Tokies: enchantment is like frost. Even when it's bad people keep playing it because it's so pretty to play
[3:33:35] MrUglama: any content i should grind in shadowlands before it goes awat?
[3:33:36] LeXieSterling: Right some us don't want to play till it the game launch without all the bugs.
[3:33:42] mmrghost7: it sucks so hard that new class doesnt have tank spec
[3:33:46] isurprises: Mail healer class should feel good
[3:34:09] MILESkg21: first healer since MOP dude
[3:34:13] pavepawns: bout time!
[3:34:19] Balistic8608: Balistic8608 subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 13 months! 
[3:34:20] Wcvechten: I'm just happy we  also get a ranged dps
[3:34:25] Zendero89: first new ranged class since ever
[3:34:29] Tokies: we really needed a mail spec though
[3:34:35] UltiCarnagee: Well the game desperately needs more Ranged DPS, and Healers could use diversity too.
[3:34:35] HotTahdy: you could always heal towelliee
[3:34:39] HotTahdy: :)
[3:34:39] OGXanos: It just doesn't make sense. They have a perfectly good option with black flight earthwarding
[3:34:39] veetz21: how does ranged feel
[3:34:41] mmrghost7: there is gonna be shortage of tanks in 10.0 due to so many ppl playing the new class
[3:34:47] stabzmcgeee: the game had less ramghed then vanilla!!
[3:34:53] KShellZx: i'm still waiting for hunter tank spec
[3:34:53] MILESkg21: DATLEWT streams were amazing
[3:34:54] Orion280: shaman tank spec when
[3:34:54] stabzmcgeee: ranged**
[3:35:04] rauko_64: or they go fully madness and make a cloth tank
[3:35:06] Sam_Nash: what's the new class?
[3:35:08] Molvonos: @mmrghost7 No there's not.
[3:35:13] NickLeonhearth: @Towelliee admit it, you want another tank in the gam so Sloot can spend another week in Thorgast Kappa
[3:35:20] Rejecide: Get tanks from extra spec, Earthbreaker Shaman or hardlight priest
[3:35:20] mmrghost7: @mmrghost7 just u w8
[3:35:20] Moobot: World of Wacraft 10.0 Expansion LEAKED ON MAIN SITE! Could be deflection? Mebbe? THRE BE DRAGONS! https://www.wowhead.com/news/world-of-warcraft-dragonflight-expansion-leaks-on-blizzard-website-326583 We are doing a 24 stream for the expansion announcement. Be here!

[3:35:37] Rudric_Ice: the race looks shit tho
[3:35:47] abracka_: i am sucking hard on the copium for a tank spec on evoker
[3:35:47] Molvonos: @Rottencoarse Opinion
[3:36:02] Rottencoarse: ?
[3:36:12] Collected1: they'll tweak it between now and launch for sure
[3:36:12] Tokies: the race is very early. Why is everyone down on it so fast. We might be getting massive new sliders
[3:36:12] Layinthawood: @Rudric_Ice how so?
[3:36:13] Sledgecore: you can change body size?
[3:36:16] Hitokiri83: the dance needs work
[3:36:19] nitroe: All the dragons they showed had eating disorders
[3:36:22] sleepy_anko: Its also work in progress, they might work on the models.
[3:36:32] Velashen: Can you fix their chicken legs?
[3:36:33] cappei: @Towelliee Did you see Khadgar is coming to the Dragon Isles?
[3:36:41] TheItalianStallion321: not apparently...we are
[3:36:42] FranciscoTheMage: @Towelliee so what are those big ass four legged dragon things we are always fighting
[3:36:43] OGXanos: do we know what weapons Evokers will use yet?
[3:36:54] stabzmcgeee: like i said the game had less ranged spec then it did on release
[3:37:00] Sluggs_: first time they released a new class that was ranged dps
[3:37:00] Rudric_Ice: @layinthawood  not a big fan of lanky lizards
[3:37:02] daddydepression96: It's not that we are too melee heavy it's that there are fewer raid spots for melee
[3:37:06] smiteyzzz: Image being a dragon and not being able to tank Lore wise
[3:37:11] PirateX84: they are unarmed
[3:37:13] Wcvechten: Dragons better be using guns
[3:37:15] PirateX84: rip monks
[3:37:16] Alepouditsa: the stick of truth Kappa
[3:37:21] mmrghost7: staffs and wands
[3:37:27] luckfore: they use their moths
[3:37:27] cappei: Looks like Evokers will just be using stat sticks. But which type? Who knows. Sorta like Feral/Guardian
[3:37:29] MerffTV: Staves, off hands, the usual caster stuff
[3:37:31] luckfore: mouths
[3:37:32] Molvonos: @smiteyzzz There's no lore that indicates dragons are tanks.. though?
[3:37:34] TheItalianStallion321: fire breathing weapon
[3:37:39] Kelticlore: dh got the glaives
[3:37:39] Taz_85: They use their claws in mid-range attacks
[3:37:40] fewyn: i bet they use some kind of new weapon type?
[3:37:40] Sollice: Magic rings as weapons that store their power
[3:37:42] KShellZx: ice and fire gauntlets
[3:37:43] mmrghost7: what ever mages use
[3:37:43] SirVoro: staff that disappears in combat form?
[3:37:45] papascruge: probably polearms/speas/staves
[3:37:46] Taz_85: they will*
[3:37:50] ClayMatioNation: I want a dragon with a polearm
[3:37:52] Fawcheddar: Itll probably work like druid forms
[3:37:56] joe_g_433: You going to play Wrath classic? @towelliee
[3:37:58] Mattsta: yeah, might be like agi staves
[3:38:16] Alepouditsa: maby a bracelet with a stone
[3:38:19] Rudric_Ice: they will prolly use staffs
[3:38:35] Taz_85: "Dracthyr Evokers can fight from mid-range with claws and fiery breath attacks (Devastation) or draw upon the life-giving magic of renewal to bolster their allies (Preservation)."
[3:38:41] MILESkg21: or different wep per spec
[3:38:49] Praetour: Porbably get a new type of weapon liek DH with glaives and DK with runeforging etc
[3:39:02] Kelticlore: wands and off hands
[3:39:17] Mickker: libram

[3:39:17] TheItalianStallion321: Scythe wielding Dracthyr
[3:39:36] Hitokiri83: staff sword dagger offhand I think
[3:40:09] Orion280: it's rude to tweet warcraftdev and ask what weapons evokers will be able to use right? or...
[3:40:14] ClayMatioNation: Fair warning, you can't get to Zereth Mortis without first getting to Korthia. Just got to ZM last night
[3:40:36] mmrghost7: seeing that 371 gear gives me BFA vibes again
[3:40:42] Teknofear64: yup, stick with storyline quests
[3:40:50] LehBiscuit: yes the leveling is way too fast for the amount of quests
[3:40:54] Nazral: !wa
[3:40:54] Moobot: @Nazral we use Luxthos's WeakAuras! You can find all his WAs at wago.io/search/luxthos |You can find the leveling EXP bar here! | wago.io/LuxthosExperienceBar
[3:40:57] LehBiscuit: im having that issue right now
[3:41:29] ClayMatioNation: I remember when I first hit 60 in vanilla and my friends told me to keep questing before saying jkjk. Now it's for real
[3:41:32] MILESkg21: no
[3:41:45] HaxzorJimDuggan: they get a lot ruder tweets everyday trust me LUL
[3:41:49] SphericFormula: It is considerate to ask if it would be rude, though
[3:41:53] SphericFormula: so nice one
[3:41:57] mmrghost7: it wouldnt be rude they would not care about it to begin with
[3:42:04] Orion280: i don't wanna bother them
[3:42:18] SphericFormula: you won't get an answer though
[3:42:19] ClayMatioNation: Some of us are just rude by default
[3:42:26] happybooger: the worse that happens is no one replies
[3:42:35] Orion280: yeah thats fair i'ma try it though
[3:42:48] SphericFormula: Fair bud, let us know
[3:43:02] cappei: So in an interview they confirmed there are no Dragonflight Covenant. The 4chan leak that people said is real said Dragonflight convenants were a thing, so guess that guy just piggy-backed off the Mmo-champion leak
[3:43:18] swervo61: I forget how long was your SL release marathon and do you hope to have a similar length or longer one for dragon flight?
[3:43:26] Cafe0le: alpha in 2 months ?
[3:43:42] Kelticlore: I would laugh if crystal dwarves became a playble race due to magni
[3:43:43] MILESkg21: 4:30 naww fuck that
[3:43:53] Lusuhfer: mobile WOW?
[3:44:14] MILESkg21: probably WOW Shadow Legends style Kappa

[3:44:34] fred_birkhoff: man i really hope microsoft makes something of blizzard games
[3:44:53] joe_g_433: Oh you know….
[3:45:03] Orion280: tweeted them the question fingers crossed
[3:45:09] swordart2022: when is announcement ?
[3:45:10] fred_birkhoff: while waiting for lost ark to release i got into star craft 2 and now i'd be really hyped for a starcraft 3
[3:45:27] ClayMatioNation: What is your number 1 fear with the expansion?
[3:45:32] MILESkg21: the beauty of timezones 4Head
[3:45:55] vovuchka: They should add hard mode to leveling
[3:45:56] FranciscoTheMage: so what i wanna know is DIABLO 4 DEAD in the water? @Towelliee who's in charge of Diablo 4?

[3:47:54] swervo61: @towelliee do you expect to have a release marathon similar to the launch of SL or are you looking to have a shorter/longer one
[3:48:12] TheItalianStallion321: Shadowlands literally started at lvl 50 lol
[3:48:12] JonnyFivesAlive: Where did you lvl mostly 10-50?
[3:48:28] happybooger: oh.....

[3:56:39] Armdel: or did rather
[3:56:40] Collected1: its based on level usually
[3:56:40] Taz_85: It's funny, though, they made that mount equipment, then Blizzard adds mobs in the maw and maldraxxus that slow you, anyway
[3:56:41] Rudric_Ice: @Sollice wrong tanks don't get dazed
[3:56:48] JackedDown: lol it has nothing to do with your armor type the hell
[3:56:50] JackedDown: it's tanks

[4:09:56] MILESkg21: Evoker Heal Mains Rise Up towHAMUP towPog
[4:10:06] Kelticlore: Did you notice Between DH and Evoker we got a Hero Druid

[4:11:17] MerffTV: That means DH will get a ground-up rebuild, which is needed
[4:11:20] Sledgecore: I can't wait to play a hybrid Druid again
[4:11:21] Nokterian: I member the hybrid warlock days in TBC
[4:11:21] Thoreya: resto druid gonna have a kick so that can change things
[4:11:31] Kelticlore: it will be going on 9-10 years cause the Talent tree system was removed in the MOP pre patch

[4:11:47] Thoreya: enough
[4:11:55] N3llee: @Towelliee did you see some of the threads talking about the talent system and how interrupts were no longer baked in but now a talent. Curious what your take is on it the topic
[4:12:09] Nokterian: the talents that we use now are not fun they where never fun.
[4:12:20] Typical_Cats: @DeanoTV word on the street it is next week
[4:12:25] timmythegamertv: But the problem is you won't be able to play a "hybrid" class @Towelliee theirs only class and spec tree's right.. you won't get that freedom like you did in classic
[4:12:25] Nokterian: because we got systems with systems upon systems

[4:12:52] tweakeds: They said the intention was to _allow_ for hybridization to some degree
[4:12:55] PirateX84: One is a Class Tree, and one is a Spec tree
[4:13:01] Nokterian: you have class tree and specialisation tree
[4:13:03] Molvonos: @timmythegamertv Yea, you can def to hybrid,. mostly in the Class aspect of the tree and not the Spec aspect.
[4:13:06] N3llee: i think he missed my question
[4:13:11] Kelticlore: @DeanoTV in the interview they said soon
[4:13:13] Thoreya: btw lets go Celtics tonight.
[4:13:20] MILESkg21: double trees gonna be insane
[4:13:39] timmythegamertv: @timmythegamertv Which is fine, but there's only so much you can jam in a class tree though right?

[6:05:28] Thoreya: they revamped some dungeons
[6:05:29] Mr_Pennywise_: lol
[6:05:31] swervity82: sounds about right
[6:05:40] Hybridwarhawk: Fitting name for the hunter
[6:05:40] Donswag3: Dookiemeat everyone black list him
[6:05:43] LadyJasmin: t him in the bookpu
[6:05:43] enux337: hunters man
[6:05:48] fyre97_: yeah they are a hunter
[6:05:48] risetta: this is every day life of a m+ without premade group ... we get it
[6:05:48] 91Niki: Stupidity is a disease, what can I say
[6:05:54] fyre97_: sounds about right
[6:05:55] bigcountry555: sounds like every pug i join
[6:06:01] homewrecker101: thats why i have never got ksm people leaving like that
[6:06:10] board4life65: it be like that in mythic + pugs
[6:06:11] Ortinoth: this is what happens in any mode that people get an elitist attitude
[6:06:17] the_bad_goat: Black book time?
[6:06:17] Broomba: well his name fits him -- dookiemeat @towelliee
[6:06:18] PidiaP: All the bad players play hunter towBook
[6:06:19] king_julian_96: well peopele leave unforutnately all the time in mythic plus that what i really hate about mythic plus is all the leavers blizz needs to impliment sum punishment system i reckon to decenivise peopel from leaving in the middle of a key
[6:06:21] SaiyanGodX_Ano: that's why blizzard should put a ban system for this
[6:06:52] 91Niki: Yeah Blizzard needs to add a dungeon cooldown if you leave a key. Kinda like CSGO has in ranked.
[6:06:59] Kneckt: happened to me like 5 times the other day
[6:07:01] Ortinoth: people don't like failure at any level
[6:07:01] warrenny: @homewrecker101 Dont let it make you give up i was the same but i just grind it out in like 6 weeks
[6:07:01] MILESkg21: 1 death = end of the world KEKW
[6:07:03] Kneckt: wasted so much time
[6:07:06] Broomba: @PidiaP i play hunter and i am not a douche
[6:07:13] jridablo: thats the worst part of Lost ark ppl die once ot 2x and ppl leave WTF
[6:07:19] Syghtless: it sucks when your 15 key gets leavers and you are stuck wit ha 14 for the rest of the week @Towelliee
[6:07:26] dyslexican1: Mythic key runners have this weird thing where everything has to be PERFECT or they ree at everyone.
[6:07:27] homewrecker101: @warrenny i gave up after season 2 no point trying in this season
[6:07:32] ijuki: @91Niki I say "I can't heal stupid"
[6:07:32] sipilde: Ragnaros or Quel talas?
[6:07:37] Mourningztar: They might now in the office
[6:07:39] zgag: The question is why did he wait till you guys were pulling to leave.  He could have left before the key was active .  He could check the gear prior
[6:07:42] Ortinoth: also i dislike the party vote kick thing
[6:07:56] dyslexican1: Biz also wont have to go threw those by hand, there are systems to autmatically do that, then they can just review disputes.
[6:08:00] Ortinoth: i have been in groups that i get kicked right after joining cuz i wasn't the right class
[6:08:03] 91Niki: @Towelliee they have a system in CSGO where if you leave, and don't rejoin within x amount of time, you get a CD before you can join ranked again
[6:08:29] 91Niki: I wouldn't mind a system like that in wow
[6:08:37] Mourningztar: Thats how I feel in Raid on my Fury warrior
[6:08:46] xmedpakx: why did he leave?
[6:08:48] soarluss: @91Niki there is for normal queue dungeons
[6:08:49] warrenny: That first pull sucks tbf
[6:09:04] ThePawPaw: no tier p4 no invated
[6:09:06] pereadin: yeah LOL
[6:09:11] Ortinoth: @Medpak78 cuz he had lower ilvl then him
[6:09:12] pereadin: trust trust
[6:09:14] 91Niki: @hexenmeister69420 Exactly, I don't see why they can't add a similar thing to m+
[6:09:16] ArcaneSyntax: keys below 10 aren't toxic, keys between 10 and 15 are toxic as fuck
[6:09:20] MILESkg21: OH FUCK OMEGALUL

[6:18:27] 91Niki: @aumixp Never say never. He answered the way he did because Ambers lawyer is trying to prove he can still get gigs, and his rep isn't hurt.
[6:18:58] 91Niki: @aumixp If he said yes, they would've argued that he is suing her for nothing 🤷
[6:18:59] SlideCancelXDD: jokrdChads

[6:43:42] warrenny: If guilds is cross faction
[6:43:48] Arocian: yeah, didn't agree with ion's, it's not against each other comment
[6:44:15] MILESkg21: no chance they do cross faction guilds
[6:44:16] Ortinoth: i am debating about tranfering and faction chaning my allinace toons back to horde
[6:44:46] swordart2022: @Orion280 why ?
[6:44:46] Kelticlore: probably won't see cross guilds till sometime next expansion
[6:44:54] duhworks: I raid on the horde side but all my other friends are allies, I hope they do cross factions guides for 10.0
[6:45:17] Ortinoth: no cross faction guilds yet
[6:46:24] MILESkg21: monkaS
[6:46:27] Ortinoth: @duhworks only reason why i transfered anad faction changed was due to friends but they long quit
[6:46:39] StreamElements: Use code POGTOWEL120 for $120 off at https://strms.net/TowellieeFactorMarBot #ad
[6:48:13] Lynxide: Cities are still out of limits
[6:48:24] willy_billy_silly: can there be no more killing leaders
[6:48:44] duhworks: @duhworks i had to maintain like 15 toons for raiding ad friends it sucked
[6:48:58] Thoreya: i think player housing is coming in 11.0
[6:49:04] Thoreya: way too much smoke
[6:49:09] Jokervenom1978: Guild housing would be cool.
[6:49:15] LadyJasmin: maybe they could make a neutral buff so if you are in a party with an alliance you can go to SW
[6:49:17] Ortinoth: player housing in 20.0
[6:49:35] ijuki: @Ortinoth 30.0 Kappa
[6:49:35] Moobot: World of Wacraft 10.0 Expansion LEAKED ON MAIN SITE! Could be deflection? Mebbe? THRE BE DRAGONS! https://www.wowhead.com/news/world-of-warcraft-dragonflight-expansion-leaks-on-blizzard-website-326583 We are doing a 24 stream for the expansion announcement. Be here!
[6:49:38] Velashen: It will happen for players. People want it.
[6:49:43] MILESkg21: just in time for WOW 2 Kappa
[6:49:44] Velashen: Just wait lol
[6:49:49] Ortinoth: i just want account wide rep and banks
[6:49:57] Ortinoth: and quests
[6:49:58] Lynxide: Housing doesnt fit in WoW
[6:50:03] warrenny: @ortinoth Rep yes bank no
[6:50:16] Thoreya: im sayin they talk about it so much its too much smoke to not do it
[6:50:24] LadyJasmin: new world housing best housing. all they have to do is wait until new world dies get those devs and go with it
[6:50:25] MILESkg21: garrisons is the closest we will ever get to housing
[6:50:29] Amarlian: I would love a Cross Faction mode like war mode but you click and allow for cross faction enemy tapping, LFR/ LFG Queue
[6:50:31] Thoreya: they prob secretly working on it
[6:50:32] Noshpan: Would I like housing to be in WoW? Yes. Do I expect it to ever happen? Not really.
[6:50:56] Arocian: they certainly have bandwidth in next slimmed down xpac
[6:50:58] Ortinoth: @warrenny by account bank that is shared and then the character specific banks still similar to guild banks but for the player account
[6:51:03] zgag: For housing to work it would have to be something different than a garrison
[6:51:07] ijuki: Concept art maybe...
[6:51:14] N3llee: yea no way they do any housing
[6:51:16] OGXanos: The problem with housing is you kinda have to add to professions too. So they have to get professions up to snuff first before making it more compliated
[6:51:24] Kelticlore: my garrison is my toons home
[6:51:29] Ortinoth: well players for years want housing it will come
[6:51:33] Karbonn: @MilesKG21 And Garrisons felt so impersonal imo. I didn;t like them at all.
[6:51:34] ijuki: Hey, I can't even make a stick figure correctly DansGame
[6:51:35] enux337: get the expac out and then work on housing
[6:51:41] Jokervenom1978: Microsoft will give us housing!
[6:51:47] warrenny: @ortinoth Om yeah
[6:51:59] zgag: Something like other players can break into your house and steal your stuff.  IE if you had your bank in the house
[6:52:00] Arocian: New World housing is great. You can decorate and display accomplishments. Cool concept.
[6:52:06] Ortinoth: housing could work as the cross faction peace time
[6:52:09] MistaHat: Call it a dragon cave
[6:52:10] warrenny: Trophies statues etc for curve ksm @towelliee
[6:52:19] Burkody: It'd be a cool way to reaccomodate old reps and shit
[6:52:30] Velashen: They reuse assets as much as possible. No reason not to.
[6:52:37] warrenny: @burkody Why tho
[6:52:40] Burkody: give people a reason to play the rest of the game
[6:52:40] Arocian: we had a version of guild housing with the cllass halls, cool enough but
[6:52:44] Noshpan: @Towelliee Speaking of professions: I would love for the gathering professions to be all be learnable. Restrict crafting professions to 2.
[6:52:47] pereadin: Trophy room in player housing?!
[6:52:51] Yetik: Yeah just a place that woudl physically represent your character and acomplishements
[6:52:58] ijuki: @warrenny To save time
[6:53:07] Arocian: yeah
[6:53:17] N3llee: that would be sick as fuck
[6:53:23] stallowned: shiiit that would be awsome
[6:53:27] xxsargexx: player housing is a big enough feature to where it can carry over expansion to expansion, as long as they work their asses off to get the framework done and it works along with a bunch of features that gets added in patches
[6:53:28] Jarwerewolf: lul
[6:53:29] N3llee: server first 80 hunter ehre
[6:53:34] N3llee: LETS GO
[6:53:34] zgag: Max thought a guild house would be better than a solo house
[6:53:36] Yetik: great to show off collectibles
[6:53:42] Karbonn: That's why I really didnt like garrisons. They were not about you AT ALL. Was all cookie cutter.
[6:53:51] Aidler: that would be the ultimate flex for people who do a lot in the game. mounts are getting old
[6:53:57] xxsargexx: they just have to get it done for 1 expansion though just to get it started
[6:54:13] Yetik: LUL
[6:54:17] N3llee: no way to say it.. just let it go
[6:54:18] Arocian: all the one player guildhousing
[6:54:26] Ortinoth: Guild housing i would have to say no
[6:54:33] IianaDRK: depends what the trophies are for. if u can get some for normal, heroic, mythic
[6:54:33] Burkody: Guilds are fluid and most don't stick together longer than a patch cycle imo
[6:54:35] OGXanos: you're not wrong
[6:54:36] MILESkg21: just furniture FeelsBadMan
[6:54:37] IianaDRK: and any other type of achievements
[6:54:42] srs_business: I feel like figuring out a way to do housing without making it completely instanced is the annoying part (well, besides all the art assets needed of course). I suppose you'd have to do districts somehow
[6:54:42] ijuki: Low ilvl gear on the wall? Kappa
[6:54:45] 91Niki: PET BATTLE TROPHIES HYPERS
[6:54:55] Malvurak9109: @towelliee YOU DOUCHEBAG!
[6:55:04] MoonwalkingAngel79: personal house i prefer so i can make it to my taste
[6:55:05] Malvurak9109: @towelliee 😂
[6:55:11] zgag: Maybe you can dump off your tier gear into their guild vault
[6:55:14] Arocian: yeah, guild hoppers would gain much
[6:55:16] OGXanos: give them wipe counter trophies Kappa
[6:55:27] MILESkg21: Pull counter awards KEKW
[6:55:33] D3m0nHunt3r666: just make your own guild Kappa
[6:55:37] Kelmor: Housing of any kind is just a waste of resources, and the least of WoW problems
[6:55:40] ijuki: Death counter in AV Kappa
[6:55:47] reqluim66: Imagine housing for alliance, you will see them hiding 🙈 throughout the year, they will ignore pve and pvp 🤣
[6:55:52] BlackAngelxD: BlackAngelxD subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 11 months! 
[6:55:54] dyslexican1: I don't think thats everything. Im not oneof them but i know some people who just love to costomize the spaces and get way into that stuff. And want to be able to commit resorces to get rare items and stuff for the housing. sor tof like a the pet system.
[6:55:55] IianaDRK: they should do it like the old guild vendor. where the guild achievement unlocks a personal trophy u can put in ur own house
[6:56:06] Daddyknut: dad guilds having world first raid finder banners in guild house
[6:56:09] dyslexican1: I dont care about player housing but i know people who really REALLy do
[6:56:10] Arocian: towHAMUP
[6:56:16] mythradrill: do u think servers can handle millions on the same instance servers like garissons for housing?
[6:56:22] Burkody: I think if they want to do PH, they don't want to rush it and everyone hate it anyway
[6:56:34] Incredible_Sausage: just update garrisons
[6:56:44] zgag: Imo, player housing would be great on a server like Moonguard.  I can see it on RP servers
[6:56:49] Thoreya: yeah theyre gonna go all out
[6:56:55] Thoreya: theyre not gonna half ass it
[6:57:00] Jarwerewolf: 20.0 patch wow
[6:57:06] Arocian: yeah, for sure need to put the time into something like that
[6:57:10] MILESkg21: not like the SELFIE PATCH Kappa
[6:57:12] Burkody: They can't just cookie cutter it cause it won't be good
[6:57:16] 91Niki: It would need to have an auction house and a bank in order for people to actually hang out there
[6:57:19] ijuki: Housing with dance studio POGGERS
[6:57:21] MrUglama: OSRS has housing :)
[6:57:46] OGXanos: "new in wow 12.0, build your own mudhut! choose from bones or wood."
[6:57:48] Ortinoth: we probally will see some sort of battle pass in wow after MS takes over
[6:57:50] Karbonn: They did garrisons YEARS ago so it's not like the engine / servers can;t support player housing. It's 100% possible. Just requires people hours to make it.
[6:58:37] MILESkg21: towHAMUP enjoy the vid
[6:58:38] xKillerPanda_: Yo! Have not played WoW in probably 6 years. How's the game now?
[6:58:40] pereadin: See ya tomorrow!
[6:58:44] stallowned: peace towHAMUP have fun at the movies
