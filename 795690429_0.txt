[0:43:52] dimofodi: Do you think Venthyr will be sufficient vs Kyrian in M+ ? I was considering going Venthyr since it's currently best for M+ prot, Raid/M+ holy, and M+ Ret but Venthyr it looks like is winning out as Raid Prot and Raid Ret.

[3:28:03] Murlocz: Heroic cata dungeons werent easy
[3:28:04] papaPathos: there definitly was a huge increase in dungeon streamlining from vanilla over BC to WotLK, with cata introducing more story in dungeons, thus articifally prolonging em. I think the fastest dungeons were legion, personally.
[3:28:23] chexmixz: Cata dungeons got giga nerfed! I remeber prenerf cata dungeos where they would last so long healers would oom

[4:16:36] Domi98_: i have 5 ads blocked so they must have KEKW
[4:17:15] Aphro_Samurai: i mean the legion wep intro quest, not the legion intro if that makes sense
[4:17:21] Dwarfi: @Towelliee whats the second bar under your energy bar? slootHmm
[4:17:27] AxiosImmortal: I still havent exactly decided if I'm going to main horde or alliance, I'm just in the process of rerolling some pre-boa toons right now to replace it with allied races without paying cash for race change lol.
[4:17:27] Moobot: Check out Towelliee's latest Youtube video! https://youtu.be/-eGBUXg0d_A BEST PROT PALADIN COVENANT FOR M+

[4:18:04] swampt1l: i tabbed out for a second and missed Rukhmar spawn.....
[4:18:31] MetallicusGaming: quick screenshot, we found a vulpera fan LUL
[4:18:32] AxiosImmortal: I dont really like the trolls never have, not even zandalari
[4:18:37] griffdog125: ever see a dark iron dwarf and valp. mate
[4:18:45] msmester1: i like vulpera such cool animation and fun racials
[4:18:47] PaegopahTV: We all in WoD
[4:18:49] PaegopahTV: content
[4:18:56] Sadlylate: vulpera is arguably worse than pandas
[4:19:03] swampt1l: Worgen worst race
[4:19:25] tibbus1730: worgen had dark flightn though.
[4:19:32] Dwarfi: give vulperas to alliance and give horde dark iron dwarves
[4:19:33] Vanixc: @Sadlylate instead that pandas are rly funny to play :D
[4:19:33] Wulfknightz: i love vulpera
[4:19:34] Aphro_Samurai: dont be dissing my 2h vulpera dk broooo
[4:19:38] AxiosImmortal: yea I have worgens and night elves to delete off my character list lol
[4:19:47] griffdog125: that panda food buff trhough
[4:19:51] bluegrassbat: I love Monk, I just wish Blizz remembered it existed lol
[4:19:56] AxiosImmortal: that would make me switch to horde @Dwarfi
[4:19:57] Ipakk: red fox tail panda <3
[4:19:58] MetallicusGaming: Dwarfi nononono we alrdy have gnomes that's enough LUL
[4:19:59] Sadlylate: Pandas did lowkey grow on me.. i still hate the fact that theyre here though @Vanixc
[4:19:59] tibbus1730: wow, Night elves are still the best class in them game
[4:20:12] KaisenSiru: DansGame
[4:20:16] Angerina: Lack of tail
[4:20:18] Aphro_Samurai: @Towelliee bruh my worgen outlaw rogue with 2 fist wep looks badass
[4:20:19] swampt1l: who the hell in there minds says i wanna play a worgen KEKW
[4:20:22] nilachip: the noble worgens ?
[4:20:33] irishwhiskey__: Vulperas don't belong in WoW imo
[4:20:36] Dwarfi: @AxiosImmortal i would be there greeting you as a DID
[4:20:41] torvoltas: i do
[4:20:44] cygnus888: me
[4:20:47] nilachip: me
[4:20:48] MagnetarXR: all alliance races are to bland and generic for my taste
[4:20:48] Noshpan: At least female Worgen look a lot better than they did at Cata launch
[4:20:50] Sadlylate: alliance racials right now :(
[4:21:01] PadidinJones: They used to be good for DKs when Cata came out
[4:21:03] msmester1: i started playing a goblin first now all big races feel so slow LUL
[4:21:04] tibbus1730: I mad my hunter a worgen back when they came out, haven't changed him back yet lol
[4:21:09] tibbus1730: dark flight is so good
[4:21:09] Ipakk: druid is good for worgen, just be in cat/bear/moonkin
[4:21:12] MetallicusGaming: female worgen is alright, but the male animation is blah
[4:21:13] swampt1l: cant wait to use naga as a race
[4:21:20] Skedler: if elves werent so cool id play a worgen
[4:21:20] Vanixc: @Sadlylate Bc they was an easteregg in wc3? Thats what I hear the most, but I dont understand it was rly creative from blizzard to put them in this game with a good story in my opinion :)
[4:21:24] AxiosImmortal: I could never play draenei either, idk why
[4:21:31] irishwhiskey__: Ogres would be a sweet horde race
[4:21:33] tibbus1730: Worgen sux for transmog though they are soo damn ugly
[4:21:37] Skedler: but its tauren for me
[4:21:52] majindarkfire: @Towelliee turn on autoloot
[4:21:53] irishwhiskey__: i wanna play a two-headed ogre mage

[4:22:20] jos_navar: Tauren and Worgen helms can be a hit or miss
[4:22:23] Brianp_123: new project 50. level 50 worgens to 50
[4:22:31] msmester1: no highmountain tauren paladin is kinda sad

[4:47:29] Slitze: as farm as fun. lich king as far as story was so bad ass though
[4:47:35] godcomplex33: They need to make it more personable with sockets and enchants again tbh
[4:47:48] adominea: i get the new expansion on the 24th of this month at 7am

[4:51:17] Menion01: It's not more loot though is it? I thought it was just more of a choice.
[4:51:26] Ezekyler: tanks on pvp, ruining the fun of others Kappa
[4:51:40] Nicefeetgirl: isnt the vault loot ilvl per activity line only determined by that activity?
[4:51:44] MetallicusGaming: grimrains win alot of bgs real fast, the only way
[4:51:52] godcomplex33: The dungeons being overtuned and abilities being undertuned in leveling is a concern but other than that its been awesome
[4:52:08] SsenkradDesruc: @Towelliee I wanted to support you and use your gfuel code, but shipping would've cost me $28 :( feelsbadman
[4:52:12] harmlessmadness: Yo! How is WoW these days with max level 50? I think it sounds interesting af that you can level up everywhere, no?!
[4:52:21] Bixster: resiliance will fix it?
[4:52:28] msmester1: if all players have more vers its gonna do nothing LUL
[4:52:34] MetallicusGaming: just bring back resillience on pvp gear
[4:52:37] Akoudadis: Are we going to loose the neck? and the back? anything on that?
[4:52:38] swampt1l: Ret probably wont be good in shadowlands but im hoping im wrong
[4:52:38] kunadrob: what do you do now becose i have 2 max lvl and i dont play the game just waiting for shadow
[4:52:49] sh4d0wsky: you must be jokin resilience on pvp gear Keepo

[4:55:26] Nicefeetgirl: like for example, I did a 15 mplus for the week, and capped conq also for the weekly vault, they wouldnt be the same ilvl correct?
[4:55:51] Zettabyte: Multi Choice Game Kappa
[4:56:05] Bixster: depending on your rating
[4:56:36] Slitze: u get more options the more mythics u do? was side track sorry
[4:56:36] Nicefeetgirl: yeah i figured about rating. Ill probably just do the mplus for my 3 choices
[4:56:38] sh4d0wsky: @Nicefeetgirl depends
[4:56:49] PvtHudson093: M14 still gets you the highest lvl loot from the vault @Towelliee
[4:57:19] Staksor: yeah, it's pretty confusing

[4:57:46] Slitze: at the end
[4:57:51] Zettabyte: Math FeelsBadMan PepeHands
[4:57:52] cabalish: metrics ^^
[4:57:55] SsenkradDesruc: @Towelliee can you realistically get to the a point in SL where you can no longer upgrade anything?
[4:58:15] Nicefeetgirl: I mean every tier is essentially like that
[4:58:18] jure__: thats when you play an alt
[4:58:40] Bugszy: i dislike how they are doing mythic gear thhis expack
[4:58:43] Slitze: which is a good thing imo
[4:59:16] SsenkradDesruc: so there'll be no incremental upgrades? I mean the same item with same stats, but 2 extra intellect for instance
[4:59:17] Nicefeetgirl: While I sort of enjoyed azerite and essences im happy to see them gone
[4:59:30] Slitze: it'll work itself out as we play

[5:00:16] Staksor: yep, no bonus rolls
[5:00:21] Nicefeetgirl: not sure how i feel about that one
[5:00:27] Bugszy: only issue i have mythic plus is that i work a demanding job so having the time to raid and do the mythic plus keys for soo many each week is going to be hard work
[5:00:28] Chidini: Lovely
[5:00:32] brainy95: what? there will be no bonus rolls for SL?
[5:00:35] Zettabyte: F Bonus Rolls
[5:00:37] realiteegaming: slow loot trickle
[5:00:46] frejdal: Yeah, Runas got plotarmor. Touch of death can't deal with that
[5:00:47] Chidini: I havent followed SL at all to have a completly new experience
[5:00:52] c10starburst: I use Bonus ROlls in Heroic Runs
[5:01:00] c10starburst: Heroic Dungeons that is
[5:01:06] PadidinJones: I mean mythic + was good to have the bonus rolls
[5:01:07] Slitze: @HydraSC watch some vids dudes have on youtube on classes you'd be interested in and do neck and cloak initial quest dude

[5:02:00] Webw0lf359: whats wrong with being dine, you sub doesnt change if you dont play for a few days
[5:02:15] PadidinJones: I think the last time they did that was in Wrath with the frost emblems no? @Towelliee
[5:02:31] realiteegaming: is the maw daily or weekly?
[5:02:32] cpain__: Yeah the caps are going to be very nice!

[5:06:20] dewkayy: Have they announced Shadowlands pre-patch events?
[5:06:50] Synister_Mitch: Is the mob health bars you have Plater?

[6:20:59] Pleau: the balance was patched in later @Towelliee
[6:21:00] YungPecku: we both had 10 yeah
[6:21:01] msmester1: +30% anima with warmode is fking broken btw
[6:21:04] Ezekyler: they changed the % later
[6:21:06] Scoodles91: that wasn't added in the begening of the expantion, i think
[6:21:10] dym_jt: that came during BfA IIRC
[6:21:25] PadidinJones: It actually doesnt make sense that they do not have equal percentages
[6:21:27] Siba234: I would hope it resets when SL comes out
[6:21:29] Stargazer27: but player ratio wasnt equal 100%
[6:21:31] Pleau: no, it was patched in later because there was a disadvantage, it was not a system on release @Towelliee
[6:21:33] Ezekyler: that's when they add the quest Against Ovverwhelming Odds
[6:21:46] DwarfWarrior25: 30% for Alliance on Silvermoon EU, has been for nearly 10months now

[6:24:08] Staksor: I'd go with Ubisoft+
[6:24:42] zskeech: its assassins creed, doesn't need much hype

[6:27:00] msmester1: these games are so long i dont mind to spoil myself with 1-2 hours
[6:27:04] Enigmio: but there is no game ready driver out yet
[6:27:23] jure__: there is a memory leak that will be patched on release. Happens after like 20 minutes of playing, your fps drops big time
[6:27:44] StephTheDonut: IS there a place where i can get the addon that TOwellie is using with his config?
[6:27:54] Jericco8: gamerady driver does't fix the memory leak,the game has to be patched

[6:30:49] msmester1: a store in a full priced game is just bullshit
[6:30:51] M0nkTV: it's all about taste, i'm a hc wow player since 2004 but i remember back when i played single player games like tomb raider and such i was so happy with it in the downtime

[6:33:36] Soulofdragon01: @Towelliee healers need to learn dispell magic on that boss
[6:33:41] Azmodon: I think it's appropriate to vocalize stores in single player games is unwanted. Otherwise devs will just keep adding them and try to squeeze every cent they can, no matter the ethics behind it

[6:44:30] tibbus1730: MM waas always my favorite spec, until they removed the pet, now it's BM for solo play, but still love MM
[6:44:37] Zettabyte: Balance.....
[6:44:41] Qoax: Zone out and back in
[6:44:46] swampt1l: Ion secretly plays Lock Kappa
[6:44:52] metavahn231: its like having a MMO with 30+ classes to balance
[6:45:02] joshchillbro: you can use a pet in MM but you do 10% more dmg is you dont :P
[6:45:20] Allaryn: shadow priests go WOOO
[6:45:29] metavahn231: blizzard just mega nerfs you and never compensates it
[6:45:31] Webw0lf359: God in EN --then trash-now god mode -- you know what is next...
[6:45:37] PvtHudson093: Balance? ypu mean devs throw a dart at the class dartboard and thats what gets nerfed
[6:46:06] kranztheman: LUL
[6:46:08] swampt1l: unless ur a Lock
[6:46:09] swampt1l: KEKW
[6:46:25] snuffles_80: and then 1 year have passed :)
[6:46:30] metavahn231: like 5% does anything
[6:46:31] Bugszy: been doing it tat way for years and years
[6:46:37] kranztheman: i love playing enh
[6:46:43] idenkaz_: KEKW
[6:46:43] swampt1l: thdLUL thdLUL thdLUL
[6:46:48] PvtHudson093: I still cant believe Ret aura is going live
[6:46:57] metavahn231: even 10% would be fine
[6:46:57] S_CoR: feral dev will feint if that happens
[6:46:58] pavepawns: lets go higher! 400%
[6:46:58] Webw0lf359: 40% of zero is still zero
[6:47:02] pavepawns: or even higher 40000%
[6:47:05] KYANGOz: 40% would still be undertuned
[6:47:08] The_Frapster: I thought it was always, ok look, we have a problem, they learned how to play their class, we need to shake things up
[6:47:15] idenkaz_: feral need a rework. complete overhaul
[6:47:25] cruzeal: feral FeelsBadMan
[6:47:33] jalanea: how does feral have 0 utility
[6:47:38] Sovekz: Why are people crying about feral? Enh Shaman has it worse
[6:47:42] pavepawns: theres like 40 feral players
[6:47:43] Janigiv: not worth PepeHands
[6:47:46] Asc3nd4nt: PepeHands
[6:47:46] bb_floki: 40% ? rerolling right now
[6:47:47] metavahn231: i saw 1 feral in bfa
[6:47:51] wescorn: I main feral :c
[6:47:55] jure__: its not worth altering, so it has to be reworked
[6:47:57] fisher91_: I probably would play feral if it wasn't garbage :(
[6:48:01] Burnnick: feral, checking in
[6:48:04] cruzeal: stay strong ferals FeelsBadMan
[6:48:07] msmester1: but no one plays it cuz bad then dosent fix it cuz no one plays it? Pepega
[6:48:16] Soulofdragon01: why play feral druid if you can play rogue. same idea better class
[6:48:18] pavepawns: we could also go the opposite way
[6:48:20] metavahn231: hybrid tax still exists
[6:48:28] NokillNogold: end of legion
[6:48:30] pavepawns: nerf them to non existence and pretend they never existed
[6:48:31] diArcipE: TBC
[6:48:31] Woedzjie: Maybe more would play feral if it was better?
[6:48:32] JustAwaay: those ferals should just reroll, both of them
[6:48:36] TheFabilolz: End of legion
[6:48:39] anamroth: legion
[6:48:39] Moobot: Check out Towelliee's latest Youtube video! https://youtu.be/-eGBUXg0d_A BEST PROT PALADIN COVENANT FOR M+
[6:48:41] Scoodles91: end of legion it was good
[6:48:41] fryin_: Antoris
[6:48:48] pavepawns: antorus they did quite alot
[6:48:50] captain_steve_rogers: People complain for the sake of complaining, Blizzard is always wrong in their eyes yet Blizzard is that kid telling you "Get REKT Noob and Get Good"
[6:48:50] Ipakk: its similar with spriest, nothing that cant other classes or healer bring
[6:48:51] ErneeGG: MoP
[6:48:53] cruzeal: feral was super good end of legion
[6:48:54] siradonis1: Another big problem is also the fact, that they do not offer the best support in raids
[6:48:54] Clear_Starlight: Cata, Last patch of legion
[6:48:56] metavahn231: i mean thats most specs
[6:48:59] msmester1: They need crowd pummeler back Kappa
[6:49:03] stickylicious21: had a friend in Pieces in MoP, he did great damage with Feral back then
[6:49:08] idenkaz_: i mean what ferals need the most imo is to back down on how much you actually need to do as a feral to do some damage. put the bleeds ect on one skill and let the player have some fun ffs KEKW
[6:49:21] LuciWho: if ya playing only one class in wow ya doing it wrong
[6:49:44] melariah: LUL LUL
[6:49:44] SubQ: damn, been playing the game wrong for all these years.
[6:49:51] Sovekz: Feral players actually managed to convince people they are the worst class KEKW
[6:49:53] SubQ: my life is a shimmy sham.
[6:49:54] The_Frapster: WHat? There's more than 1 class?
[6:50:00] bb_floki: LOL
[6:50:09] Oktokrush: xD
[6:50:21] cruzeal: FeelsBadMan
[6:50:23] dym_jt: ye and snapshotting etc.
[6:50:25] BrotherBeezy: That's the issue with balancing them. They can kill it in M+ if you're playing with a player who knows what they are doing.
[6:50:26] Clear_Starlight: plus Snapshotting on top of all that
[6:50:31] metavahn231: but u can shapeshift POGGERS
[6:50:33] idenkaz_: PepeHands
[6:50:40] purplejesusss: they can't even crack top 15 lmao
[6:50:50] killerkus: we need more love to the ferals
[6:50:51] metavahn231: emergency bear form
[6:51:13] metavahn231: that thing...it scares me
[6:51:47] Webw0lf359: any one who plays feral in arena will be good, since it is hard to play those that do will be good at it
[6:51:52] metavahn231: blizz:its a pvp class
[6:51:58] Hangalik: I strongly believe dps meters shouldn't be considered when trying to determine how fun a spec is
[6:52:07] CrawlerCarl_: lol
[6:52:08] TwoBrew: good morning all
[6:52:28] metavahn231: its a gathering spec tbh
[6:52:32] msmester1: maybe thats why they dont buff it it would be kinda op in pvp LUL
[6:52:42] snuffles_80: fun?? whos talking about fun :D
[6:52:44] idenkaz_: KEKW
[6:53:24] cruzeal: lfr monkaS
[6:53:27] Hangalik: every spec is viable if you play it correctly for more then LFR
[6:53:28] redbulladin: "i wanna play feral cause its fun! can i get an invite? so i can enjoy this fun specc!" "no ur dps is shit"
[6:53:28] TrippsGD: you want to feel like you're playing something relevant
[6:53:50] msmester1: i turned off the dps meter and helps it with focus on playing the actual game 4Head
[6:54:01] swampt1l: I just play hunter cause its 3 buttons and pew pew top dps
[6:54:40] LuciWho: It's not fun feeling useless
[6:54:57] d3vde: how would you then determine when a boss should die? "they didnt kill it because they dont have the dps but they had fun so... SMITE enjoy your loot"

[6:55:05] dym_jt: Imagine playing a game and thinking that "fun" is being on the top of the list, KEKW.
[6:55:14] Hangalik: I agree, not everyone's fun is the same as mine, but I'd argue that a spec can be fun even if it doesn't make it top10 on dmg meters
[6:55:26] Sovekz: Probably gonna ditch Enh Shaman for BM or MM hunter, so much easier for a lot more dps
[6:55:51] roverrone: Hunter so boring though
[6:56:20] captain_steve_rogers: But the thing is @Towelliee Arch is an Elitist though and nothing much has changed with RUIN since then

[6:56:51] Clear_Starlight: if Feral isnt strong first patch of SL, i might have to swap class's for the first time
[6:57:14] bermad33: the truth is what make you strong
[6:57:22] cruzeal: @Clear_Starlight i'm going bear FeelsBadMan
[6:57:25] Oktokrush: yeah but it has to be done
[6:57:26] GenobreakerZZ: damn i loved that dungeon so much back in the day

[6:57:47] metavahn231: yes feral suck, WW just fine Kappa
[6:58:19] saboos69: hey guys do heirlooms still give xp during pre patch ??? thank you for the help

[6:58:41] msmester1: its kinda funny how some classes are never "bad"
[7:00:00] tibbus1730: Don't worr guys, when Raid Tier is reintroduced, feral and WW will be broken again
[7:00:25] qtceef: dont forget crits too
[7:00:31] rpgpro24: whats better for warr for pve arms or fury
[7:00:32] Bugszy: its true but also if people tunnel and dont swap to adds etc
[7:00:34] Yiub: Has feral ever been broken?
[7:00:43] Merlin840: at least its not back in the day when a prot warrior only gained rage by taking damage. so an offtank would just stand there with their thumb up their ass.
[7:00:45] msmester1: i play outlaw i blame it on the bad rolls 4Head
[7:00:49] Syprus1: as a DPS i like meters for two reasons 1) am i doing it right? and 2) Im very competive i like to see how i stack up
