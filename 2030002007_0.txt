[4:50:33] Dynamics831: it sounds really good Cosmin
[4:50:41] mandito_: i feel like the arm could be a touch lower and the mic angled towards your face a smidge
[4:50:45] SOFUC_KING: you can use noise cancelling if you dont want to hear the keyboard
[4:50:46] Frank4LuLz: sound more boomer?

[4:55:03] Tinyeco: PRO WoW PLAYER Pog
[4:55:15] SOFUC_KING: people in the top guilds
[4:55:15] Zefior: i dont think "professional" wow player only means road to world first/mdi players docShrug
[4:55:23] SOFUC_KING: like method or limit
[4:55:24] DevilDolls: You play wow for your profession though your profession is streaming
[4:55:36] DevilDolls: I say it counts
[4:55:37] SOFUC_KING: world first kills
[4:55:54] mandito_: is there another game that could take your attention away from wow anyway?
[4:56:01] mandito_: wrath is pretty cool
[4:56:02] StarShopping95: @DevilDolls like entertainer vs athlete though. They can operate in the same space but it's different
[4:56:04] Tinyeco: You are 100% a pro wow palyer
[4:56:17] bedmadifakii: you are pro desi

[4:57:18] Tinyeco: You got invited to blizzcon...
[4:57:21] SOFUC_KING: you probably put in twice as much time streaming compared to a full time job
[4:57:30] Vanyue: you're my favorite arena / pvp player vanyueLOVE
[4:57:31] XomerPrime: Actually the definition of being a professional in a game just means your generating your income with it (like a profession). So you're basically a kind of casual wow pro I guess
[4:57:31] StarShopping95: read my comment xdd
[4:57:39] Zefior: by that definition no one is a pro wow players docShrug
[4:57:52] mandito_: kermitNODDERS fair

[4:58:53] furtif_69: rwf get nothing from blizzard only from orgs/sponsors
[4:59:00] StarShopping95: RWF don't but Liquid has people on salary so they can play year long like THD and FiredUp
