[6:43:30] Nrage_24: Its an acquired taste, bit like dark chocolate really.
[6:43:56] Avery_Nice_Guy: but you can find some roasts that people make now that are like vanilla or sweeter flavored and it helps with the bitterness
[6:44:00] Julkaisu: also im a sucker for Juhla Mokka which is finnish percolated coffee
