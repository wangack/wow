[0:35:49] Regroot_Gaming: And there's me , progging mythic tindral and still has no lego on my pally
[0:35:51] king_redbeard13: I've been clearing Heroic since drop still no leggo
[0:35:52] Pyrrha_GG: 6-7 weeks max
[0:35:53] TotallyNotRaien: yeah a questline
[0:35:54] flabstv: the only player who got it in my guild is a holy pala lol
[0:35:54] lol_iris: Legion legendaries moment TrollDespair
[0:35:58] yuhhhhe: it sucks because it doesnt feel like the bad luck protection does anything
[0:35:59] fisher1: 3rd week drop
[0:36:00] REDSUNDERGROUND: a holy pal got it  befor  me  hes  never played  ret
[0:36:05] YugeCrit: SM kinda blew dick
[0:36:06] nekitamocika: its that spongebob meme watching outside window other people having fun
[0:36:08] Donswag3: why not have odds work towards 100% once you get enough kills?
[0:36:08] snowfloofy: tbh it would be less annoying if you could visibly see the bad luck protection in some way
[0:36:10] Zeviius: I don't think HC items are a good addition in the current iteration of WoW
[0:36:12] Ok_Kingston: dont have it be a drop, have it be a mage tower type scenario that you have to be good at the game to get it. 1 try a week.
[0:36:16] Benjg7: funnel to one person wouldn’t work in modern wow
[0:36:17] yuhhhhe: feels so bad to go through the effort of farming bad luck protection not knowing if it does anything
[0:36:17] gwenmh: it's actually disgusting that classic wow is getting dinars before retail, they won't even like them!
[0:36:18] cannibalcanyon: lmfao true
[0:36:19] Valynces: Valynces subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 16 months! YE YE YE
[0:36:19] Vsplague: How it is now is fine imo
[0:36:20] zannuss: Kinda damned no matter what they do
[0:36:20] Zeviius: Legendary/
[0:36:22] Dowson91: I dont get why the blp isn't just a 'fragment of fyr'alath' that you combine like 20 to get, so you have a chance outright but you know how close you are
[0:36:22] Joneim: And then the guy who gets the legendary leaves for a different guild
[0:36:23] dakiann: legion
[0:36:24] shizuma_lol: wod rings
[0:36:25] dakiann: :D
[0:36:25] Varryan: Legion legos
[0:36:27] Tehblured: it needs to be like fireland staff or rogue daggers
[0:36:29] elysona: BFA legos
[0:36:29] prugar: honestly if they just made so you could maybe see the % drop from the random items maybe
[0:36:29] Cakerinotv: the bow
[0:36:29] aurochz: Legion where u got your 2 bis last KEKW
[0:36:30] Karkesis: panda cloaks
[0:36:30] Tehblured: its just a quest
[0:36:31] bbrinda8: BFA S4 back
[0:36:31] EFFSIN: Shadow mourn 100
[0:36:32] Benjg7: imagine you funnel it to one dps and they dip to another guild
[0:36:33] TotallyNotRaien: was the leggy cloak from mop good?
[0:36:33] cannibalcanyon: the frickin unity belts KEKW
[0:36:34] Domekowski: shadowmourne would start civil wars in retail guilds over who gets it first for their rio push

[0:36:35] Rendlaws: firelands staff

[0:36:37] Moly_42: wod rings lmao

[0:36:38] Regroot_Gaming: Bfa cloaks / draenor rings
[0:36:38] fisher1: End of legion
[0:36:38] Joneim: Panda cloaks were neat
[0:36:38] MVP_OW: MOP cape
[0:36:39] lol_iris: Whoever says legion is cooked AF
[0:36:39] zannuss: Ring or cloak
[0:36:39] Rexy95: the rings
[0:36:39] demepunkk: I really only played Shadowlands, those legendaries were decent to get
[0:36:39] midwithamouth: shadowlands once you could do them correctly and wear 2
[0:36:39] Richadin: beni
[0:36:39] Spiritcb: Panda cloaks
[0:36:40] tagzin_: rogue daggers?
[0:36:41] Scoops__: the cape?

[0:36:44] MVP_OW: MOP cloak
[0:36:45] Varryan: Legion legos with currency
[0:36:45] Sover31gn: MoP/Wod charity legos
[0:36:45] Adovkatten: Mop Cape
[0:36:45] Pinkupz: amanthul
[0:36:47] dknamey: shadowlands craft
[0:36:47] Ghaesh: Wod rings
[0:36:47] Deripak: WOTLK leggos
[0:36:48] dakiann: then mop cloaks
[0:36:48] fisher1: MoP kek
[0:36:50] EndureAnd_Survive: The cloak
[0:36:50] shizuma_lol: WoD rings ez
[0:36:50] GameChampTCG: or hunter lego from sylvannas
[0:36:51] Morinik: mop cloaks
[0:36:51] Ok_Kingston: dont have it be a drop, have it be a mage tower type scenario that you have to be good at the game to get it. 1 try a week.
[0:36:53] sardow90: BFA CAPE
[0:36:57] Ditysalad: ulduar hammer
[0:36:57] zannuss: WoD ring?
[0:36:58] Byggareebob: MoP cloaks WoD ring
[0:37:00] Karkesis: the means of acquisition of the mop cloaks
[0:37:01] xii_kyle: !wallpaper
[0:37:01] fisher1: Firelands
[0:37:02] CoffeeASAP: at least in SL you didnt have to randomly wait. Not having it for months feels awful
[0:37:02] jeffereyk: fishing pole
[0:37:03] choiyena_izone: firelands staff Pog
[0:37:03] lesbianpunkpyromancer21: shadowlands if it was more fun to make them
[0:37:04] Ruinx81: Never
[0:37:05] gotsh0cks: Who cares if everyone has it
[0:37:09] Sover31gn: ALso funneling, right?
[0:37:09] nekitamocika: No way people saying BFA Cape and Neck those were the worst
[0:37:12] phearsom: Cata Daggers
[0:37:13] muonz: well thats also a popularity contest
[0:37:14] Regroot_Gaming: ITs same as shadowmourne
[0:37:14] Karkesis: tarecgosa wasn't different from Shadowmourne right?
[0:37:17] sgtmuffi: not legendary per se but corruption made gear feel like legendaries
[0:37:20] Regroot_Gaming: Raid had to contribute
[0:37:23] Thdlock: its actually shadowlands but they were just more powerful embelishments since u jsut crafted them
[0:37:26] Ok_Kingston: dont have it be a drop, have it be a mage tower type scenario that you have to be good at the game to get it. 1 try a week.
[0:37:26] Sover31gn: Same thing
[0:37:27] Therealbrokensword: the rogue daggers gave you a good set of epics in the mean time
[0:37:29] TotallyNotRaien: why does your enjoyment of an item come from others not having it tho
[0:37:30] tyrone_shoelace: shadowmourne is actually good to me. a weapon should be super powerful and difficult to obtain. it isn’t legendary if everyone has it
[0:37:33] tacochan: shadowlands :)
[0:37:34] BigTrout3: that's the thing; legendaries as they were don't work in today's zeitgeist of gaming. it's player power but you have to get really lucky
[0:37:43] Sover31gn: We had two roguies and lost one in dragon soul due to daggers
[0:37:47] qtla: @Maximum Legendary being random drop is dumbest thing they could have done. Make it drop from last boss  on hc being lowest difficulty. Motivate people want to have it get better.
[0:37:51] gwenmh: our disc priest got our second one and it didn't even work, i will never forget that
[0:37:55] cannibalcanyon: agreed
[0:37:56] kingrhodo: Yah I agree
[0:37:57] nekitamocika: SL legos were just crafted items that we ahve now
[0:38:00] ShadowDuelist21: true
[0:38:04] surpriseparty20: Makes sense
[0:38:05] BigTrout3: before it was prestigious
[0:38:05] reggiepowa: this legendary implementation is fine, people are just bitching because they want bis gear from day 1
[0:38:08] Deripak: Wotlk leggos were both deterministic and kinda hard to get
[0:38:11] Varryan: artifact weaps worked as embells, legos where the icing on the cake
[0:38:14] Regroot_Gaming: True , when you come to a point where are able to buy them from a vendor or craft them , its no longer leggo
[0:38:17] ThisIzD: warglaives of azzinoth
[0:38:17] turnsta: that's the thing of it though. to make it feel not as shitty to get, it makes them not feel like leggos. dunno how to balance that out to make it feel epic and not bad at the same time
[0:38:38] dknamey: bro its been 10 weeks wdym day 1
[0:38:38] BiBaButzeBenne: "current 2hander" - so legendary, you dont even know the name LUL
[0:38:44] faetterguf: theres a fine line between being too easy to obtain and too hard, either doesnt feel special or feels too hard to get
[0:38:45] gotsh0cks: I got brought over our other ret because I got fyralath
[0:38:50] Basic_3: So your response is, people are wrong.
[0:38:52] nekitamocika: firstGarf
[0:39:00] Hugosuave: i wouldnt play anymore
[0:39:01] draconisraccoonis: @reggiepowa not even close. having derp get boosted in H raid and getting it to drop with no effort vs someone who has progged and killed bosses to not get it to drop is a shit system
[0:39:01] erra1994: LOGOUT
[0:39:02] dango0n: I dont want my gear ever
[0:39:02] Donswag3: the gear grind is real
[0:39:04] Pyrrha_GG: 10 weeks in not having 10% of your DPS is pretty sadge so that guy is def wrong
[0:39:06] Thdlock: its like cheating in a single player rpg when u get bored
[0:39:09] Thdlock: xdd
[0:39:09] Cutestboy69: our guild is killing heroic Fyrrak weekly though with 5 axe users and not a single one yet
[0:39:10] Alarius_: @reggiepowa tell me you're not a plate dps main without directly saying it
[0:39:12] Spartany25: This leggo is not fine (imma caster so personally not affected) Seeing super casuals run lfr and get one, and other run everything for 3 months. Not good
[0:39:12] dschmidt: JAB like response. "you think you do, but you don't"
[0:39:12] ibjorgi: I think the best way is a combination of the current version with stuff like Warglaives. Don't make me wait for a drop and then finally when I get a drop I have to do a quest, but also make it semi deterministic that I will get the drop @Maximum
[0:39:15] zannuss: I think if maybe we could see what our bad luck protection % is at it might be better
[0:39:18] Donswag3: Love starting to play alts that need gear in all slots
[0:39:19] Thasin22: i still wish gear was more meaningful but i know WoW is a different game now
[0:39:22] N0vaOmega: I'd be ok if the rng protection did anything for the drop rate lmao
[0:39:23] surpriseparty20: Half of wow fun is gearing
[0:39:31] gali5656: sword lol
[0:39:36] Vsplague: The heroic drop is fine, maybe make it guarantee on mythic kill
[0:39:40] Sover31gn: Yep Sword
[0:39:44] Alarius_: sword lol
[0:39:45] Crusader226: I finally got my axe last week.
[0:39:46] tagzin_: "this late into the patch" hall of fame still open btw
[0:39:46] Regroot_Gaming: @Maximum How do you feel about current legendaries losing its power due ilvl upgrade of the next raid tier ? do you think it'd be more fun to actualy be able to upgrade those legendaries every new raid tier like the evoker legendary is useless now since the ilvl is way lower than the current raid ilvl
[0:39:48] fisher1: I got the axe and then the next week my guild disband on mythic fryak
[0:39:48] aescend_: Stop yappin start swallowing
[0:39:49] fisher1: was nice
[0:39:49] metel7: metel7 subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 14 months! wooooooooooo
[0:39:50] dango0n: I think that the crest reduction for upgrades should extend to your alts. @Maximum
[0:39:51] yuhhhhe: my guild has only seen it once and its so depressing
[0:39:51] Sover31gn: What sword? xdd
[0:39:51] Neomagam: Valanyr is definitely the best way. Need to get some boss kills and doing hard mode basically garentees a drop. Then need to kill the final boss on a harder difficulty. Epic and fair. the best by far
[0:39:51] lol_iris: Also the RNG bad luck protection is just weird
[0:39:53] JansonLives: can attest. feels bad man
[0:39:53] nekitamocika: "Bad luck protection" in theory should be good, but it kinda doesnt work, they should make it like u get 5 greater embers then u get it
[0:39:54] Pyrrha_GG: i log on, i do raid, i dont get it, i dont play the rest of week super fun
[0:39:58] turnsta: is there just a kind of breaking point where it should be obtainable via a vendor or something
[0:39:59] ibjorgi: I think the best way is a combination of the current version with stuff like Warglaives. Don't make me wait for a drop and then finally when I get a drop I have to do a quest, but also make it semi deterministic that I will get the drop @Maximum
[0:39:59] goblingher: Every week more people stop playing so fun to get it when no friends play anymore
[0:40:01] Rexy95: my tank buddy got it before me :'(
[0:40:06] Ruinx81: By the time I get it it will be season 4 and useless
[0:40:08] Alarius_: says world first raider
[0:40:09] Possitiviti: it matters cause we cant cross realm mythic
[0:40:09] Rahvin331: There needs to be weekly tokens earned for something like that so that eventually you are guaranteed to get it
[0:40:16] leubinator: matters for crossrealm opening
[0:40:18] Korupcija_: pyro is back on wow? KEKW
[0:40:19] Never_Go_Full_Kappa: dont slander canadians like that
[0:40:21] Ditysalad: we are maybe halfway through patch
[0:40:22] PJs_Banana: i like how ff14 does it with incremental power increase over the xpac
[0:40:24] Mahranaka: it does its killing guilds
[0:40:28] aroneatingsoup: I love seeing the greater ember of fyralath drop each week
[0:40:29] Adovkatten: have you seen barney's videos max=
[0:40:32] aescend_: Pæsta
[0:40:34] Spiritcb: @maximum what do you think of the show shoresy?
[0:40:37] BigTrout3: sounds like a made up Boston accent
[0:40:37] ryles2308: i think it seams weird to some players as not everyone can get one, so less people care about the ones who havent got it?
[0:40:39] dango0n: when is 4pm for you?
[0:40:47] r_Flame: blason the goat was a good vid
[0:40:50] dango0n: thanks
[0:40:55] zlappo99: how i can get your ui?
[0:40:55] king_redbeard13: What kind of pasta
[0:41:01] fronkacean: yo thoughts on the tier list i sent?
[0:41:04] gregoryvamosi: Good afternoon peeps
[0:41:08] Sketch_Torner: @Maximum  how i feel now ***
[0:41:09] ASadMemer_: firstGarf
[0:41:11] dithrica: yum
[0:41:12] Jimmo24: pizza pasta
[0:41:17] gwenmh: it would be funny if the leggo classes were like super bis for m+ and half the mdi teams couldn't get it
[0:41:20] gregoryvamosi: yumm
[0:41:20] ciphkin_tv: In the are of gearing I still think it is too fast, RFW ghouls shouldn't be 8-10 ilvls from max, maybe closer to 15-18ilvls.  more similar to (I believe) CN
[0:41:22] king_redbeard13: That sounds delicious
[0:41:23] nekitamocika: show food OpieOP
[0:41:25] shale93: Vodka sauce BBoomer
[0:41:26] surpriseparty20: Bis
[0:41:30] AoPsyke: dope
[0:41:30] ebicman67: clean
[0:41:32] aescend_: Show food describe taste
[0:41:34] nekitamocika: Academy best
[0:41:42] gregoryvamosi: court of stars A
[0:41:49] fronkacean: screenshot this
[0:41:51] sence_00: new theory: Timerunning is SoO LFR wings as M+ instances
[0:41:52] dango0n: get TOJS out of S NOW!! lol
[0:42:03] Regroot_Gaming: All of DF and its contents belong to D
[0:42:10] sgtmuffi: only bad season in DF is S1
[0:42:13] dknamey: hmm
[0:42:14] Regroot_Gaming: SL is S +
[0:42:14] Joneim: HUH
[0:42:16] nekitamocika: Source: he made it up
[0:42:20] sinfusion: @sence_00 That is WILD cooking my friend
[0:42:22] Faraday5001: i refuse to do M+ Galakras trash
[0:42:23] Adovkatten: it sounds fun lmao
[0:42:23] dango0n: SoO is bis raid of all time
[0:42:26] Karkesis: that is turbo made up
[0:42:29] surpriseparty20: Algethar clears all dungeons therefore Dragonflight m+ is the best
[0:42:35] Cakerinotv: HUH
[0:42:37] Choderz: i need da max ween
[0:42:37] lol_iris: beat what HUH
[0:42:38] OG_Kawngi: need to beat YEP
[0:42:38] turnsta: HUH
[0:42:43] Rahvin331: no beating on stream
[0:42:51] Korupcija_: doood
[0:43:04] nekitamocika: isnt that YT short
[0:43:11] Cakerinotv: its not that popular i feel like on tiktok
[0:43:11] TotallyNotRaien: 30 year old geriatrics dont know tiktok
[0:43:14] Sketch_Torner: @Maximum  wow pl;ayers dont knwo waht is tiktok
[0:43:17] Cakerinotv: i dont see much of it
[0:43:18] Scoops__: ive never seen wow on tiktok
[0:43:20] Basic_3: What a reasonable take in a youtube comment
[0:43:22] Codester_remix: tik tok has a lot of boomers so yes
[0:43:26] TimNanook: one of my guildies is huge on WoW tiktok. it's very obscure content tho
[0:43:32] BE3njo: can u turn up the volume a bit?
[0:43:32] jondbr: very quiet
[0:43:37] fronkacean: reading youtube comments to farm content is giga brain
[0:43:38] AvgJoseph: hi do u know atlas?
[0:43:50] dizorid: can you turn her up
[0:43:50] asd123qwerty1: Perfect toilet videos
[0:43:57] Schocky12345: Schocky12345 subscribed with Prime. 
[0:43:59] ThisIzD: @AvgJoseph nope
[0:43:59] FuraiEU: Can you turn the vid up plz
[0:44:01] Basic_3: "I get oneshot in my +35. Blizz nerf"
[0:44:04] Regroot_Gaming: I mean its true
[0:44:07] lol_iris: Cuz it's not a problem
[0:44:12] lol_iris: It's a feature
[0:44:14] Tigerklaue: true , balance should be around +20 keys
[0:44:19] Basic_3: Blizzard doesn't give two tugs if the best key in a season is a +28, or +30, or +34
[0:44:22] prius_tv: I think they need to do another stat squish
[0:44:30] smashwow: you wanted your healing check Kappa
[0:44:30] fisher1: Lower the damage modifier and Lower the Timer on the dungeon
[0:44:31] king_redbeard13: Couldn't you get to a certain key level and perform the dam then lower timers more
[0:44:48] Cakerinotv: remove infinite scaling
[0:44:48] KGB_Habs: Cap damage increase at +20 and keep the hp scaling. That way, its gonna be back at timer at some point.
[0:44:57] Arkshol: @Cakerinotv hell no KEKW
[0:45:02] Basic_3: @king_redbeard13 You could, and then keys become more like MDI depending on where that cap is.
[0:45:12] Mahranaka: bro it sounds like you are watching it on yoour phone
[0:45:15] Arkshol: thats boring
[0:45:19] turnsta: +20 is low
[0:45:20] fisher1: Lower the damage modifier and Lower the Timer on the dungeon
[0:45:22] Mahranaka: too quiet
[0:45:25] Basic_3: Cap damage at a 20 and we'll be doing no healer keys on week 4
[0:45:26] CrerisRs: could have mob hp scale faster than damage
[0:45:27] camerongio1: problem is when the thing that one shots you, you cant see who is getting targeted and it one shots without any prep
[0:45:36] Regroot_Gaming: I mean that's why u dont see ppl doing 35+ cause of the infinite scale
[0:45:37] MoleDude: yes
[0:45:37] lol_iris: yes
[0:45:39] shale93: yes
[0:45:40] KGB_Habs: Reduce timer is probably better yeah
[0:45:42] lol_iris: faster to play
[0:45:43] shale93: more health is tedious
[0:45:45] lol_iris: more enjoyable
[0:45:45] Choderz: cooking here
[0:45:47] BurtikShaun: that way you just end up with spongy enemies
[0:45:49] Spartany25: if it were capped at +20 then u'd have no healer meta 100%
[0:45:51] Ganryu22: Just cap boss HP then
[0:45:55] RayWoz: capping dam will be 4 dps meta
[0:45:59] lol_iris: 25 is a bit low
[0:46:00] fellbear: pull complexity and how you manage the pulls are the fun part
[0:46:03] smashwow: either way you run into the inevitability of the key isn't doable.
[0:46:04] Karkesis: more health means something actually changes at least, shorter timer means the 25 and 26 are literally the same key if you can time the 26
[0:46:07] br0ther_tim: 25 too easy this season
[0:46:10] fisher1: +1 level cap every week
[0:46:11] nekitamocika: 25 this season is easy, it wasnt in S1
[0:46:14] Ganryu22: the biggest issue is boss lasting 7 minutes. I feel like trashes it is less of an issue
[0:46:17] smgBanzai: eh, at least there's a mechanical difference. if it's just a timer difference then if you time a 26 at a level that would have been a 29 time that would feel so gross
[0:46:21] surpriseparty20: That's the shit they should experiment with next season
[0:46:21] Basic_3: Don't worry, Mage will still be better than your class no matter how they balance it.
[0:46:22] goombacci: then people would complain that the only healers taken are ones with high damage
[0:46:26] Richadin: season 1 20 and season 3 20, are they not different?
[0:46:32] caveman2x: my hot take: make M+ like dynasty warriors.. its all we want
[0:46:37] jondbr: quiet
[0:46:48] Its_Big_Tone: did i miss the tier list
[0:46:58] Nox1o: from a coding perspective, thats incredibly easy
[0:47:08] menzlo: They just needed to buff mob hp
[0:47:11] Spartany25: @Its_Big_Tone no, havn't done it yet
[0:47:15] Ganryu22: Qestion is then: at which key level do you start the diminishing scaling stuff? How Blizzard does it at a start of a patch?
[0:47:28] camerongio1: I love fighting a boss for 6min Aware
[0:47:29] goombacci: then only high damage healers will be taken
[0:47:32] caveman2x: 10 minute boss fights
[0:47:33] Cakerinotv: re cook mythic plus altogether baseg
[0:47:33] goombacci: and people will complain
[0:47:36] duhworks: make the curve smaller?
[0:47:38] Choderz: 11 mins boss fights. 2 lust
[0:47:40] Korupcija_: put M+ in an oven Madge
[0:47:48] Ganryu22: i feel like capping boss HP/dmg would be enough no?
[0:47:50] thefabulousenby: Instead of reducing the timer, just scale points with timers faster in 25s.
[0:47:56] shale93: EB on tyra KEKW 7 min Yalnu
[0:48:00] Rafaelfrost_: why dont ppl accept that you will inevitably reach a point where you will get 1shot by default
[0:48:01] Finear: i dunno, i would take tyranical every week than every playing fort
[0:48:05] PJs_Banana: You could have stopped that sentence at "Imagine doing a 35" xD
[0:48:05] Hemenia: scariest part about that issue is that they made Tyr in Rise still less than a year ago
[0:48:06] dango0n: shout out sanguine lol
[0:48:11] Yimbus737: for me also doing bosses with M+ talents is not always fun
[0:48:14] Nox1o: insanely tanky mini bosses are boring, thats the same thing
[0:48:21] peepofeelings: it means good damage is more valuable and ppl like doing big dmg
[0:48:28] yiannisjk: make bosses give like 10% enemies killed but make them skippable.
[0:48:46] Basic_3: Just reading youtube comments sure is some kind of content.
[0:48:48] holtrop: so much yapping
[0:48:51] Ditysalad: stop scaling health and keep scaling damage. basically you'll have to beat the boss before your personals run out
[0:49:00] BigTrout3: Sadge
[0:49:10] healapotamus: just do away with macros
[0:49:16] Basic_3: The community would never come together to agree on anything.
[0:49:18] Korupcija_: what did dratons say
[0:49:21] nekitamocika: give her some pasta
[0:49:23] OG_Kawngi: pasta now Stare
[0:49:24] RayWoz: give dog food
[0:49:31] Orthobullet: have a finite end with transmogs associated
[0:49:40] Ruinx81: Naguura comes across as super passive aggressive here days, she used to be so chill
[0:49:41] Kirapika: she deserves it tbh
[0:49:46] Kaaaaapek: Meta for season 4 mplus is?
[0:49:47] theskot: one bite
[0:49:52] nekitamocika: let her eat some pasta Madge
[0:50:13] othernewname: but he also said higher keys would be easier lol
[0:50:15] Nox1o: so incorporeal ccs you? XD
[0:50:15] Darkshore_Capital: yooooooooooo thats sick
[0:50:21] duhworks: thats sound cool
[0:50:22] Arkshol: not happening KEKW
[0:50:22] Regroot_Gaming: We both know , this will never happen , cause blizzard hates fun
[0:50:23] nanerpus_: that sounds awesome
[0:50:23] longfella: think about how awful it would feel to go back to normal after though lol
[0:50:26] goombacci: different stuff = good
[0:50:26] seoris: sick
[0:50:27] Spartany25: Dr Ws just threw up another fat W
[0:50:31] Basic_3: Now more people see 26s and get exploded by mechanics even with the affixes, and bitch about that instead.
[0:50:36] Karkesis: problem with positive affixes is it makes higher keys easier instead of harder if you're climbing from the bottom
[0:50:42] Dowson91: oh shit that kinda sounds good
[0:50:42] Scoops__: like sephuz
[0:50:45] Lilurrn: imagine fun affixes
[0:50:45] grimmakyr: The higher you go the easier it gets though...?
[0:50:47] Cakerinotv: @Maximum do you think that the damage is too high in raid? is there like too many one shots or does healer throughput even matter in raiding as much as it used to?
[0:50:49] Nox1o: storming knocks enemies up, that seems busted KEKW
[0:50:49] Kirapika: dont think anyone would be mad if they left incorp/afflicted out of the rotation
[0:50:49] Rexy95: no incorps just gives you dmg buff instead of dmg red
[0:50:50] noises90: Next update everyones RIO will report "best RIO 5k" or something if they will do it.
[0:50:50] caveman2x: M+ and affixes in general need an overhaul before TWW
[0:50:50] MidgetSpinner94: raging stuns the enemys KEKW
[0:50:51] puneet911: afflicted is an add you have to kill KEKW
[0:50:56] smashwow: yup they already got shaman's on that abilities doing the opposite of what it should. LUL
[0:51:00] Dowson91: haste buff
[0:51:02] Rahvin331: The lack of seasonal affix is a miss.  Many of those were positive, which was more fun.
[0:51:04] CoffeeASAP: so like gw2 instabilities
[0:51:04] Clarius: for the love of god give me back affixes that regen my mana
[0:51:09] buzzkill00: I like that cook
[0:51:12] nellfin: just literally reverse the affixes, the affixes are positive but gets removed at breakpoints instead of added
[0:51:15] Domekowski: storming gives you a movement speed increase and some haste
[0:51:16] Lilurrn: why do affixes have to be negative instead of positive
[0:51:20] mino661: i feel like some high keys would only be possible with the right affixes(buffs) in that case would be giga annoying
[0:51:21] Camelbak21: Or just, remove em Keepo
[0:51:22] grimmakyr: Best affix are the, do this corrrectly, get a good buff,
[0:51:25] Spartany25: Soaking up storming is a stacking dam buff :)
[0:51:29] noises90: People will think "Now I can do 30+ next season" after such season.
[0:51:29] Ganryu22: storming damages enemies, so can plan mobs moving in there to dps them
[0:51:30] grimmakyr: Risk and reward, so much better
[0:51:32] Karkesis: high-key 4Head
[0:51:37] Rafaelfrost_: yo downgrading to 480
[0:51:38] Skyros96: players can only be healed when standing in sanguine
[0:51:39] othernewname: they should make all affixes have a good and bad site at the same time, so u can cook a lot. like sanguine heals U and the enemy
[0:51:46] goombacci: mobs having 3 things to interrupt is not related to scaling
[0:51:48] Arkshol: what makes m+ a m+ is the scaling though KEKW
[0:51:50] Nephs: @Rahvin331 I agree tbh, esp with a lot of affixes being toned down now, its a shame they did away with them entirely just because thundering or w/e it was called was a miss
[0:51:58] nekitamocika: firstGarf
[0:51:59] gwenmh: alt experience blows we need mid season catchup
[0:52:02] gdtomii: firstGarf
[0:52:16] caveman2x: firstGarf
[0:52:28] Spartany25: as far as really long paragraphs go, that one wasnt to bad
[0:52:30] Its_Big_Tone: m+ popped off this season statistically i think
[0:52:32] nekitamocika: because its so easy
[0:52:36] leubinator: 20s are pisseasy so ppl do them
[0:52:37] Basic_3: S3 having more players than S2 is unprecedented and this one has a lot more players.
[0:52:37] goombacci: in other words more people are doing M+ (because of the upgrade system, no shit)
[0:52:44] CoffeeASAP: I think it depends on the type of player.
[0:52:45] murloc_oracle: bring back encrypted pelase
[0:52:51] Ruinx81: Psot on reddit shows more runs than S2
[0:52:51] caveman2x: blizzard either seems very bad at making or married to an idea of affixes that just no one seems to like
[0:52:55] itsmeSixpack: more inclusive season
[0:52:59] holtrop: @gwenmh huh its the best its ever been
[0:53:02] Basic_3: @goombacci We had the upgrade system last season, and S3 is still having more keys completed.
[0:53:04] Ilue_: 8 months of season 4 with bad dungeons TrollDespair
[0:53:04] Karkesis: didn't dratty post the M+ numbers and this is the most successful season of the expansion?
[0:53:08] ruzzlestwitch: the numbers is the amount of runs per week tracked on ***
[0:53:09] Madgeneto: PepeLaugh
[0:53:12] yelp26: Buff hpal
[0:53:15] othernewname: what if gear got debuffed in higher keys like from 25 key and keys stay the same
[0:53:23] dorki: this title seems like a good video
[0:53:43] goombacci: @dorki dorki join their tier list pls we need tank pov
[0:54:01] d0mezg4mer: thought it might just be a one word response "everything"
[0:54:08] TimNanook: giga boomer
[0:54:08] ewevix: the old dungeons wer realy fun, not overly complex like the dragon flight ones
[0:54:08] goombacci: bro writing a thesis
[0:54:09] Korupcija_: that's crazy
[0:54:11] xultance: at what point will people just be like yeah this is the limit if they keep arguing to make it more and more possible for higher and higher keys
[0:54:12] dknamey: BBoomer
[0:54:15] OG_Kawngi: bro is on his death bed Sadge
[0:54:16] holtrop: He was timing keys with jb
[0:54:17] neithoe: Old school gamer
[0:54:20] othernewname: BBoomer
[0:54:21] caveman2x: thats the problem with wow too.. not enough fresh minds to look at the game in a modern way
[0:54:24] Yimbus737: that generation used to write essays when they were bored i guess
[0:54:25] joshjarx: youngest classic player
[0:54:26] P4TTYC4KES11: god that reminds me of a reddit screenshot i saw today that made me cackle
[0:54:30] dorki: ppl never understand when we say dmg is too high
[0:54:31] Hawa51: i was born in 75
[0:54:35] StantonSC: genx not boomer, i'm older than that
[0:54:36] Dowson91: no way he'd be dead by now thats too long ago
[0:54:37] goblingher: @goombacci nah Dorki too Corpa , need to save it for poddyC spotify raitings
[0:54:42] OG_Kawngi: @Hawa51 sorry to hear it
[0:54:44] nekitamocika: firstGarf
[0:54:44] Ruinx81: Listening to Naguura just aggressively arguing with her comments is stressing me out
[0:54:46] zorsen09: 77 is gen x right?
[0:54:49] Cjzzlol: he was in his prime during alpha vanilla wow
[0:54:51] Clarius: @Hawa51 2000 year birthday soon!
[0:54:56] carlidvn: tierlisttttt
[0:55:01] caveman2x: @Ruinx81 i love this content tbh
[0:55:06] othernewname: everything which hits boomy is too much dmg  xdd
[0:55:11] TirrinWoW: farming the bad takes
[0:55:11] TotallyNotRaien: you shouldnt its a cesspool
[0:55:14] goombacci: your comments would all be about that one european guild
[0:55:22] Pyrrha_GG: i mean she isnt strawmaning them
[0:55:22] Edgy75: You do that with twitch chat ???
[0:55:24] OG_Kawngi: make a video of you getting one guy'd repeatedly
[0:55:25] Madgeneto: reverse one guy
[0:55:25] TheBroCrow: make a tomrus compilation instead
[0:55:26] Ilue_: its called the asmongold special
[0:55:30] Spartany25: isnt that what asmon does, but instead he does it live with chat
[0:55:38] Hawa51: lol and yes 77 is gen x
[0:55:41] GrimmshadoXI: She's not arguing with them or owning them, it's a discussion
[0:55:43] Greedisgood99999: sounds like you’d be mortgaging your sanity for content
[0:55:47] MistrzShrek: she should react to your stream now, asmongold content loop
[0:55:55] goombacci: @GrimmshadoXI no she is not; they cannot reply to her
[0:56:05] leubinator: a discussion needs 2 ppl talking
[0:56:11] Zereah: Would you be afraid of that encouraging bad faith discourse because trolls just want their 5 mins of fame on a Max video?
[0:56:11] OG_Kawngi: anything past 30 = boomer
[0:56:16] goombacci: @leubinator yeah people seem to forget that
[0:56:22] HakiThunderFox: @leubinator it doesnt tho
[0:56:23] othernewname: @OG_Kawngi wtf
[0:56:26] Cakerinotv: yeah I'd much rather have hp being too high over 1 shots imo
[0:56:29] Madgeneto: @OG_Kawngi past 16*
[0:56:59] Ardenth: to bypass the "not enough damage", you will have to pull more, which will lead to being oneshot by dmg overlaps or lack of control
[0:57:12] Madgeneto: too real
[0:57:14] holmat: Wacking pain
[0:57:16] Spartany25: Whats the dif between one shots and not having the dam? isn't it a wall either way?
[0:57:17] goombacci: people dont get the one shot thing isnt a matter of damage but of mobs having 3 things to kick
[0:57:22] barnanimal: sounds like a skill issue
[0:57:25] Nox1o: also the meta has new defining characteristic: can you live/do you help others to survive
[0:57:29] Nox1o: even more tuning
[0:57:30] CrerisRs: @Ardenth ye but at least it feels better to die to huge pulls rather than bullshit boss oneshot
[0:57:41] gwenmh: high key odyn sigils lol
[0:58:12] duhworks: @Maximum at when key level would you stop the scaling and make the  max timer shorter
[0:58:18] Ilue_: @gwenmh TrollDespair
[0:58:23] othernewname: piss easy xdd
[0:58:24] grimmakyr: Then they will have to fix the uncapped and capped class issues
[0:58:25] Karkesis: if you just lower the timer why not just hard cap keys at 25 and then io comes from faster times?  same thing
[0:58:29] AbieCherry: That'd be worse. It would enforce hard meta's. Only the highest damage classes would get invited
[0:58:32] dirtydeus: 25 isn’t ez for me
[0:58:35] holtrop: 28 ish probably
[0:58:41] Basic_3: The fact that you're talking about capping the keys at a level where 0.5% of the community does the keys is really telling of what a nothing issue this is.
[0:58:42] neithoe: its not very ez for the majority
[0:58:43] Kinzarro: 28 I guess
[0:58:45] purplejesusss: 25 very easy monka giga
[0:58:48] goombacci: I mean high level players consider 30's hw keys
[0:58:49] WingedChipmunk: @Maximum I definitely like JB's idea the most, but do think there needs to be A LOT of experimentation needed to find that sweet spot
[0:58:49] smashwow: 35 or bust
[0:58:50] jondbr: please turn it up
[0:58:52] Ancine: @AbieCherry which is better since classes are balanced around doing similar damage, not taking similar damage
[0:58:53] Its_Big_Tone: @Maximum  that could also slip us into the "healers need to do X damage issue" in keys again
[0:58:53] Ok_Kingston: go run a 25 with no healer right now and tell me you dont need one
[0:58:59] YugeCrit: It's already that
[0:59:00] purplejesusss: 25s is top 1% of players omegalol
[0:59:06] ItchY_val: Thats already what it is plus tanky
[0:59:08] lordvader420: F*** the matter who cares about that s***
[0:59:13] Cakerinotv: thats def not wosre, its FAR easier to tune dps than defensiveness
[0:59:15] Spartany25: ret
[0:59:18] P4TTYC4KES11: bm hunter does good damage but cant survive
[0:59:22] Ardenth: @Ardenth I definitely agree, but you will still die to survivability all the same from passive dmg
[0:59:23] 1_7_4: verse stacking ww monk xdd
[0:59:28] othernewname: pls pug a 25 with 2800 rip players lol
[0:59:28] goombacci: @Cakerinotv and for healers?
[0:59:29] ToxicLG: challenging but not bullshit is super hard to balance for when I doubt blizzard is testing these dungeons at +30
[0:59:34] Basic_3: @purplejesusss Title right now is mostly 27s, so yes
[0:59:34] WingedChipmunk: think Verse being HIGH REQUIREMENT for high M+ feels VERY VERY bad
[0:59:37] Joneim: We should delete mages, that  would fix all of this
[0:59:40] Ashille: that would just force people to somehow drop the heal, or just pick the heal that do damage
[0:59:50] Cutestboy69: Agreed on damage tuning
[0:59:51] holtrop: YEP
[0:59:52] MrCrippels: wrong. Top keys done with boomie
[0:59:54] Betto11: @Maximum If it just came down to dmg what would the meta comp be?
[1:00:02] reggiepowa: @Maximum do you think plate dps were tuned around leggo?
[1:00:15] Cutestboy69: WRONG MAX LMAO
[1:00:17] smashwow: boomie cries in raid. shines in keys
[1:00:19] Madgeneto: GIGACHAD
[1:00:20] goombacci: then agreeing with you; since they give mark of wild
[1:00:24] AbieCherry: moonkins survive one shots
[1:00:27] here_take_my_money: boomi get carried by aug and disc
[1:00:29] Omegabet__: wrong. Hi
[1:00:34] Gromasaurus: It's crazy good, especially when considering enhance is capped at 6 and it ends up doing the same or 5% less then everything else that's uncapped
[1:00:40] othernewname: dorki never goes bear Kappa
[1:00:43] MrCrippels: haha, Im on the phone 😂 couldnt bother writing more
[1:00:45] Madgeneto: also aug
[1:00:50] joshjarx: moonkins feelings irl arent tanky either
[1:01:07] ZACKandATTACK: Moonkins also hate getting verse. I swear to god they are made of paper
[1:01:07] Scoops__: sack
[1:01:13] payloon: and mark of the wild
[1:01:24] Cutestboy69: It feels like blizzard also just has a different design style this season
[1:01:29] Cutestboy69: timer is free in every key
[1:01:36] leubinator: there is a 31 timed with a hunter and a boomie i have no idea how they lived that key
[1:01:37] Cutestboy69: but does feel like there is a lot of damage
[1:01:50] goombacci: aka tyrannical bad
[1:01:54] Rampo123: :3
[1:02:11] joshjarx: fury is unkillable meanwhile arms is made of paper
[1:02:28] Cutestboy69: Fall this seaosn
[1:02:32] goombacci: yeah
[1:02:33] Cutestboy69: like only half the key is needed
[1:02:35] Rampo123: what u pushing bud?
[1:02:36] BurtikShaun: #justiceForHealers
[1:02:37] goombacci: also healers dont exist
[1:02:41] reggiepowa: @joshjar_ arms ain't that bad but fury is definitely tankier
[1:02:51] Ok_Kingston: they just needed to nerf the timers for this season but they didnt
[1:02:54] MrFaith87: wont he pulls just get wilder until survivability becomes a problem again?
[1:03:23] Basic_3: @MrFaith87 Don't worry, they'll complain the game is too complicated with kicks and stops as they pull 5 packs together.
[1:03:45] Cutestboy69: Some of the youtube commenters for wow really need to consider going nonverbal instead of typing lmao.
[1:03:52] goombacci: @MrFaith87 or they will complain only classes with 10 stops get brought
[1:03:57] Nox1o: only 2 options, you share my opinion or you are wrong
[1:04:04] goombacci: @Nox1o baseg
[1:04:16] menzlo: They even said they didn't mean for it to be permanent
[1:04:19] Morayeden: Accidentally making gold
[1:04:29] theskot: that was a lucky idea lol
[1:04:31] DrakeDuude: Lower times for higher levels, would it favor the speed classes and they would always be meta?
[1:04:34] Madgeneto: imagine if they left every single system for 8 years WAYTOODANK
[1:04:55] goombacci: @DrakeDuude yes, and  no healer/one healer
[1:05:01] Basic_3: @DrakeDuude There is no way to make any game system that doesn't favor some specific specs.
[1:05:05] goombacci: @DrakeDuude like one specific healer class
[1:05:25] bLYYYPLAYS: Heyooo!
[1:05:25] isFeyz: @Maximum would it help the issue if the increase was spread out and less steep? like having a current +30 be a +50 instead, annd rather than getting +3 on your key you get up to +5.
[1:05:36] Basic_3: It's so weird that she is talking up "optimizing damage" and talking down "optimizing survival" when they're just both aspects of the game
[1:05:42] Therealbrokensword: how about adding affixes for more score? like during a tyran week I can go to a vendor and add fort or an extra t2 affix for extra score?
[1:06:08] CrerisRs: @Basic_3 any tank can pull more shit, not every class can just suddenly live more stuff
[1:06:16] dorki: its also about
[1:06:18] CactusJak__: the reason people even running evoker atm is because of boosting survivability
[1:06:20] dorki: optimizing pull size
[1:06:22] Cakerinotv: and only a select few classes can deal with it
[1:06:30] dorki: more often than not youre better off playing safe in high keys rn
[1:06:37] Basic_3: @CrerisRs She literally lists out 5 or 6 things you can do to live better. Vers flask, different trinkets, etc
[1:06:59] kj01a: thats what she's arguing against LUL
[1:07:03] Kayjin1223: The issue is how out of balance the DPS and survivability requirements are this season.
[1:07:08] Dreclador: would it be boring for healers if damage stopped scaling? genuine question
[1:07:09] holmat: There is a 32 atal 30 sec over the timer done
[1:07:11] selerf: optimizing damage is gameplay,  optimizing survivability is spreadsheeting
[1:07:24] lexxii44: lol
[1:07:33] Ok_Kingston: all they needed to do was nerf the timer this season. they didnt tune like they needed to
[1:07:39] riddlerboy: Can't it be said the same for reading comments that long and responding?
[1:07:42] Nox1o: maybe he can type at 200wpm, so thats like a sentence for him
[1:07:46] Kayjin1223: One-shots aren't interesting because they're a pass-fail.
[1:07:47] goombacci: @selerf optimizing survivability just means only having 5 classes played
[1:07:49] Therealbrokensword: personally the timer should hit before the scaling matters
[1:07:56] othernewname: yeah it is
[1:08:11] Kayjin1223: That's just innately less interesting than something like damage optimization or survival optimization that requires you to do something more than push a defensive at the right time.
[1:08:15] bebincalicious: RageyBoom RageyBoom
[1:08:25] Ok_Kingston: this discussion would never exist if they set better timers
[1:08:28] OlaF_oo: that's just bad for lower keys - most players
[1:08:29] reaperscarl: plus the phial last the total amount of a dungeon...
[1:08:32] Dreclador: @maximum would it be boring for healers if damage stopped scaling at some point? genuine question
[1:08:39] camle1234: @Maximum do you want to play Fortnite Guitar Hero with me?
[1:08:46] j_e_zz: what lvl of mythic+ keys would compare to mythic raiding?
[1:08:47] Cakerinotv: I still feel like they should lower the percentage that each key scales
[1:08:49] Karkesis: hell would healers even get invited
[1:08:57] Its_Big_Tone: @Maximum  healers would have to build for dmg then imo
[1:08:58] Tuulz_: if damage stopped scaling, healers can do more damage.
[1:08:59] OlaF_oo: healing burst dmg is not fun
[1:08:59] Basic_3: It'd be boring for them to sit in Valdrakken as they don't get invited
[1:09:02] ZACKandATTACK: I feel like damage should scale to around the 20 level and then just start gigascaling the mob hp. Make people figure out how to live and fit in as many gigapulls as possible instead of being scared of every pack.
[1:09:12] 0_____Kappa: you can just stay in cat for 80% of the dungeon instead of 50% YEP
[1:09:27] goombacci: @ZACKandATTACK 20 is zzzzzzz
[1:09:35] gwenmh: they should let healers do more damage then the opportunity cost for not optimizing would be higher
[1:09:36] Basic_3: If they did that would healers say they feel too weak as it takes 7 globals to top somebody?
[1:09:45] Dreclador: ya, they could need healers to make it feel good. I like that thanks
[1:10:09] Ashille: I really don't agree with you, it's just a math problem, nothing say the scaling must be the same for health and damage scaling, you can solve the issue
[1:10:15] Arkshol: @ZACKandATTACK 20 boring as fuck
[1:10:22] Cakerinotv: everything right now for healers is just reflex checks lol
[1:10:47] xWolfey26: xWolfe26 subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 3 months, currently on a 1 month streak! Love when i get to finally catch you life and hear your takes on stuff :D
[1:10:48] Basic_3: Sounds like we're nerfing healing by 40% again then
[1:10:49] Ashille: @Cakerinotv absolutely wrong
[1:10:51] Madgeneto: is it just me or there's a healer drought?
[1:10:54] Girdil: yeah, and ashenhollow was very balanced for HPal\s
[1:11:04] goombacci: @Cakerinotv just know ability timers lol
[1:11:24] goombacci: yeah pretty much
[1:11:39] Madgeneto: remove forti and tyran YEP
[1:11:40] glowyhands1: my hot take: use non-linear scaling that cycles every +10, and add *something* new every 10 (new affix, positive affix, etc)
[1:11:42] TotallyNotRaien: should the problematic attacks do % health damage?
[1:11:55] Karkesis: I think literally the only two solutions are a) tune damage/health better or b) hard cap key levels, idk what's even left to discuss
[1:12:11] Zzekar: so what will taht serve ? hitting a +35 as a max doable key ? tbh thats how scalling works .. just change M+ completely or i dunno .. its insanely bad for everyone :)
[1:12:13] keenxp: idk if the dps in my pugs suck but most timers at 27+ aren't very free for me
[1:12:36] camle1234: @Maximum want to play Fortnite Guitar Hero with me?
[1:12:50] theDirtyon3: LUL
[1:12:51] goombacci: two options; that implies something to discuss
[1:12:52] Yagr6: some specs have piss water defensives as well
[1:12:54] OG_Kawngi: Rock Band was my jam
[1:12:55] nalegi07: @keenxp 27 is pretty close to the level where you need to be in comms with people and have an actual plan
[1:12:55] healapotamus: I think bigger streamers get better helpers @keenxp
[1:13:00] Madgeneto: @camle1234 drineyd Sadge
[1:13:03] joshjarx: whos trying to play some Fusion Frenzy???
[1:13:04] Gromasaurus: The real solution is uncap enhancement shaman
[1:13:06] xrandomdoodx: it would be interesting to see damage output matter more in M+ with a lower timer, because Aug would prob drop off a lot @Maximum
[1:13:09] therealborko: tru lol
[1:13:17] therealborko: I suck at GH and play guitar
[1:13:20] JansonLives: it can help w/ coordination and rhythm
[1:13:21] kj01a: pretty sure knowing how to play guitar makes guitar hero harder lol
[1:13:35] smashwow: nah irl guitar doesn't help with guitar hero. lead guitar in all that remains couldn't play their song on guitar hero LUL
[1:13:37] Ashille: they are an infinity of solution btw, just use positive affixes that give you DR if you do them at the right time
[1:13:38] MourningSage94: is pugging a 27 meant to be a high success chance?
[1:13:42] camle1234: How do I get o7 to work again, got a new computer and can't remember what I had to get for those emotes
[1:13:56] goombacci: @xrandomdoodx and only one spec healer would be played, creating the aug issue in the healer slot
[1:13:58] leubinator: @camle1234 get 7tv
[1:14:00] ZugThugTV: @camle1234 7tv
[1:14:04] clohky: triple havoc time
[1:14:15] sorrowfulsea_: sorrowfulsea_ subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 14 months! yo
[1:14:20] Basic_3: Mage?
[1:14:32] Ry_TV1: 2min timer difference with the same route same key (DHT 27 Fortified)
[1:14:37] soupfuel: its like the old prot pally argument x1000
[1:14:44] Ry_TV1: from the keys i have done
[1:14:49] soupfuel: when they just had more utility than any other tank
[1:14:55] MisterNioce: With that logic, classes like warrior should be top pumper? For example
[1:14:59] OXDOX: Now what if a tank has the most utility and is also the tankiest and does the most dmg. Would that be okay?
[1:15:00] Basic_3: Prot Pal and VDH bring more than every other tank. They really don't balance around utility very well, if at all.
[1:15:20] xrandomdoodx: Ele sham sadgwe
[1:15:22] MisterNioce: Couldn't agree more
[1:15:23] dogmaster9000: idk why thats controversial lol that seems self-evident
[1:15:32] Nox1o: @OXDOX if you add a "and easiest to play" you get s2 bear
[1:15:40] Yagr6: ele sham existing lol
[1:16:04] Pyrrha_GG: but then you always say damage is always king so hybrids will just never get brought
[1:16:04] JayBlaaaze: and then utility doesnt have the same wieght in m+ vs raid
[1:16:08] clohky: its always hard playing a class without bl or cr for m+
[1:16:10] CactusJak__: isnt that vdh atm @Maximum
[1:16:10] sealteamsesh: Thats dh right there
[1:16:15] smashwow: there should be a CBA for taking X class. and if you don't have one asset you should have the other asset. to a point at least.
[1:16:15] Zzekar: yea .. they did it .. finally feral>boomy for real
[1:16:20] Clush___: @Maximum add 3 M+ talents like pvp has to plug the utility gaps
[1:16:21] Ancine: some keys are fine, rise you never run into a survivability issue but into timer issue. Meanwhile DHT is absolutely busted
[1:16:23] barnanimal: isnt that vdh right now?
[1:16:25] healapotamus: warrior can shout and jump I guess that’s enough
[1:16:35] elysona: TThats how prot war feels since it has -5 utility
[1:16:43] surpriseparty20: Now that we talking about bdk naowh cleared a +30 atal today with a bdk
[1:16:47] caveman2x: ramping bdk sounds so fun, like a stacking buff the longer ulive
[1:16:51] StantonSC: I think ret pally does good dps for their utility
[1:17:10] Ashille: no DK would dominate lower key
[1:17:13] PinkTaricFTW: Dead party deals zero damage
[1:17:14] Incin_gaming: yeah thats because dmg is king LOL
[1:17:18] Squats3: for M+ damage is most def not king right now
[1:17:18] CactusJak__: 8/10 is an understatemeent
[1:17:19] camle1234: o7
[1:17:22] goombacci: because survivability is king right now as we have been saying
[1:17:23] larkhill: Our bdk got a legendary so he just pumps
[1:17:24] reggiepowa: @elysona used to be the best tank at the start of df
[1:17:24] Sover31gn: Cant compare any other class utility to aug I think
[1:17:25] Incin_gaming: augs get brought because dmg is king, their buffing alone
[1:17:25] smashwow: tbf they think aug is a damage increase
[1:17:26] Squats3: it just happens that veng is broken
[1:17:26] riddlerboy: 8/10 pug dps are also idiiots though
[1:17:27] turnsta: love repping the 8/10 o7
[1:17:28] menzlo: Wouldn't it be more interesting if some dungeons were defensive and some required dam
[1:17:30] joshjarx: last season fury was probably gonna be in tgp before aug. strictly because its dmg was insane for every pack
[1:17:32] holmat: safety make you do more dam
[1:17:33] DadBodGeoff: If an aug doesnt have logs dont invite, if they have logs and there not running 75% + uptime also dont invite.
[1:17:40] Nox1o: maybe 8/10 that queue into 28s, otherwise its 9.9/10
[1:17:41] TeamLiquid: Looking to take your gameplay to the next level? Learning a new class and would like some pointers? Head on over to our discord go.adv.gg/6tAoHx to schedule a coaching session with your favorite Team Liquid raider!
[1:17:43] JakeParkbench: How does utility stack up in raid vs high M+?
[1:17:46] Pyrrha_GG: but no one actually knows that augs are sucking
[1:18:12] Squats3: at this point in the raid, the tank you bring really doesnt matter
[1:18:20] JackOfAllApocalypses: JackOfAllApocalypses subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 27 months! 
[1:18:34] Yagr6: pvpers like CC, so i wonder how they are enjoying m+ currently
[1:18:40] othernewname: like 2 kicks on gnarlroot, duck on council, aoe kicks larodar like twice and fyrakk cc chain
[1:18:47] Incin_gaming: i mean i guess if the point is most augs are trash then sure, but from what ive seen in 25-30s augs buff times is all i can go off of
[1:19:06] Dreclador: @maximum, sorry if this is a repeat question, but where do signs fit in raid generally after that testing?
[1:19:09] mortenerenroleplayer123: @Maximum tobo said that he thinks he was 20-30k more dps then nr2 on there fyrakk kill
[1:19:09] asd123qwerty1: @maximum  is growl joining for the rankings? He had some good povs from the m+ drama yt video
[1:19:17] Dreclador: augs*
[1:19:26] Yagr6: cant dorki do it
[1:19:28] healapotamus: needs to be20-30%
[1:19:32] 15yearsagomydadleft: @maximum  quick question we are starting to prog on fyrak is double dh tank fine or do u need one dk?

[1:19:56] nalegi07: have you taken in any of Grow;s raid conent PepeLaugh
[1:19:59] Pyrrha_GG: you know that, but the people do not, unfortunately not every M+ group leader is team liquid maximum
[1:20:00] MBG_95: Growl is doing weeklys
[1:20:01] Alarius_: honestly same for the cats
[1:20:02] murloc_oracle: takes were pretty doodoo tbh
[1:20:03] mi_dude: my favorite classic streamer
[1:20:04] ZACKandATTACK: Growl is just going to be flamed by dorki

[1:26:18] Alarius_: that aint corny lmao
[1:26:22] Zimmerh: 80% of normies are narcs
[1:26:24] isFeyz: They ban more than 250K every month lol
[1:26:25] Zandrilx: Bunch of rats man
[1:26:27] Cakerinotv: you cant keep up with rmt, its impossible
[1:26:27] cendaiii: just ban the people they can catch
[1:26:30] surpriseparty20: Oh for sure
[1:26:32] Alarius_: players policing their community
[1:26:32] Armagaren: obviously they're not doing both bot banning and banning gdkp, surely it's only one or the other Clueless
[1:26:32] racks22: classic without RMT is dead
[1:26:36] savagefoxx: When I came back for wrath 99%of the people I use to play with just did GDKPs
[1:26:38] bigboyy79: what is gdkp?
[1:26:39] Nyurro: wtf is a gdkp
[1:26:40] MitchTheQuaker: there are whole discords devoted to trying to infiltrate hidden gdkps already and the change isnt even live
[1:26:43] YugeCrit: not having GM's kinda hurts too
[1:26:43] sadalxx: GDKP's are the main reason for RMT. Anyone who says otherwise, has not played Classic more than a few minutes
[1:26:51] isFeyz: Yes that's bots, not RMTers.
[1:26:58] Zandrilx: Boomer take
[1:27:08] MBG_95: I know people who have been banned for RMT recently
[1:27:11] Nox1o: i did wotlk gdkps to make gold for retail KEKW no rmt needed
[1:27:17] jorgeT313: why does the community care about rmt like the token is the same are we mad if blizzard is getting less money lol?
[1:27:18] rustycans: Blizzard havent cracked down on anything
[1:27:34] reszyy_: reszyy_ subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 31 months! 
[1:27:37] Cupz21: People will always buy gold
[1:27:37] brosciencegym: toadphNose toadphNose toadphNose toadphNose toadphMonkas
[1:27:42] 324bee21: I did GDKP in the original WotLK and they were sooo fun but I haven't done them since
[1:27:43] ogbuckwheats: Taiwan got hit hard with rmt recently
[1:27:51] Pyrrha_GG: i mean, it did, just for blizzard
[1:27:53] sadalxx: There are GDKP's in SOD right now that the pool of gold spent is in the THOUSANDS. We are level 25 and 2 months in.
[1:27:54] turnsta: how much did y'all reign in back when you were doing RMT
[1:27:56] b1azzuris: i never bought gold but i made a bunch in icc through gdkps  and you definitely noticed it when people bought
[1:28:05] Alarius_: GDPK runners getting ratted out is gonna be good
[1:28:06] Menethrill: YEP
[1:28:08] 324bee21: WTF is that transmog its sick
[1:28:11] Cakerinotv: yeah wow token lowers rmt sales
[1:28:23] nanerpus_: Staff of Jordan just sold for like 140k
[1:28:23] sos64_: i love buying gold
[1:28:25] Nox1o: the problem in classic wotlk was also that non-GDKP groups were literally filled with walking bots. The quality of players infinietly worse
[1:28:26] pinkqy: turbogaryx, never forget
[1:28:28] Ruinx81: era like that still
[1:28:31] Nox1o: literally only dog players
[1:28:34] AerialAce94: im gonna go do my underground GDKP run
[1:28:38] isFeyz: @sadalxx I've  been in +40 GDKPs since SOD launch and I've never seen a pot more than 900g. In general they only go between 150-250.
[1:28:53] CoffeeASAP: He meant sick as in disgusting PepeLaugh
[1:28:53] Craives: i saw an interview with an rmt site and they said tokens increased sales, don't remember why tho
[1:29:14] nekitamocika: BFA
[1:29:14] Morayeden: BFA best expac
[1:29:17] nanerpus_: @Craives because tokens are half price if you buy gold and use that gold to buy token
[1:29:17] Spellb00k: season 4 shadowlands
[1:29:20] Orthobullet: Shadowlanbds
[1:29:22] dknamey: AL
[1:29:22] magemaster225: Legion note even close
[1:29:24] dknamey: SL
[1:29:24] bergy101: BFA S4 GIGACHAD
[1:29:25] Ilue_: Legion
[1:29:27] sadalxx: @isFeyz I am on crusader strike US, and there have been over a dozen runs where the payout has been over 100g per person after the cuts
[1:29:28] Nox1o: bfa s4
[1:29:29] ubba90: BFA by far
[1:29:29] jorgeT313: best seasonals
[1:29:30] Cakerinotv: dragonflight solely becasue rotating dungeons are goated
[1:29:34] jorgeT313: was bfa
[1:29:38] pinkqy: BFA, but unironically SL had pretty good M+ too
[1:29:39] Spellb00k: shadowlands s4 best season
[1:29:47] surpriseparty20: Algethar clears all tho Kappa
[1:29:49] damacraze: bfa was hard carried by s4 with corruption
[1:29:50] reggiepowa: end of sl as wlel
[1:29:52] ShadowBites: rotation wasnt even a thought though in BFA tbh. It wasn't on the table at the time for the M+ roadmap
[1:29:58] Faraday5001: BFA has rose tinted glasses becuase of its last season... season 1 through 3 was ass @Maximum
[1:29:59] othernewname: i dont think ther majority wants to play the 8 same dungeons over 3 xpacs
[1:29:59] Nox1o: good dungeons with a banger season and corruption
[1:30:00] Sanctos304: slands is going to be super underrated forever
[1:30:08] homeronio_: legion m+ was the wild west
[1:30:11] seoris: azerite armor was crap
[1:30:15] Ahrmanhamma: BFA had maybe the highest highs, but the lows were pretty low right? Temple of Seth and Motherlode were poopy ass garbage
[1:30:16] Ilue_: Legion S4 FeelsStrongMan
[1:30:17] pinkqy: So, are the ups and downs better than a steady plateau?
[1:30:18] jeffereyk: bfa s4 was only fun due to twilight dev 12
[1:30:19] meowitsabby: @Sanctos304 real
[1:30:19] holmat: Corruption vendor with essence
[1:30:24] TheUncleJohn: i never experienced legion and bfa peak end because i just quit for the shitty start. now im still playin df
[1:30:27] Morayeden: Corruption and banger seasonals with banger dungeons
[1:30:28] Rafaelfrost_: each vote for tier should be hidden so that ppl dont get biased
[1:30:39] Nox1o: @Ahrmanhamma motherlode was decent in a good coordinated group
[1:30:39] bergy101: S4 seasonal affix was crazy good
[1:30:41] jorgeT313: ehhh that seasons seasonal was the best by a lot
[1:30:50] Sanctos304: slands had the best set of seasonals, just got super hard hit by covs
[1:30:52] holmat: also can do a video on fun vs borrow power
[1:30:56] Zzekar: @maximum dont u think ur drake got bored of the same zone? fly him elsewhere
[1:31:00] Ahrmanhamma: @Ahrmanhamma Ehh maybe. I kind always hated that place
[1:31:07] Morayeden: BFA had two OMEGA bad seasonals
[1:31:08] ncorgi: actual leveling artifacts at the beginning of legion was fun as fuck tho. and actually impactful
[1:31:11] Cakerinotv: and rotating dungeons is undoubtedly better in blizz mind. I 100% bet that theres been more m+ done this expansion than any other
[1:31:16] bergy101: S1 and S3 were garbanzo
[1:31:29] turnsta: infested was such a horrible way to kick off the idea of seasonals
[1:31:29] damacraze: though you could master a dungeon by like 1-1.5 seasons if you were mediocre, knowing the skips routes etc
[1:31:30] nvpal: marked by lightning Pepega
[1:31:30] Nox1o: i cant even remember the early seasons to be honest
[1:31:32] Buboniks: Reaping was the best affix ever
[1:31:33] Morayeden: But dungeons and essences still banged
[1:31:39] CoffeeASAP: at least they had the option to sometimes be fun, the regular affixes are all bad lol
[1:31:47] Nox1o: selective memory, probably like all the classic players
[1:31:51] danaxvx: affixes that help you are fun
[1:31:52] goombacci: TrollDespair paint
[1:31:56] Morayeden: Red dot
[1:32:04] Morayeden: I am.
[1:32:05] SkirsdagTv: Integrate, the area underneath is the fun
[1:32:07] Durenas: no
[1:32:13] nanerpus_: suffering early causes a lot less players
[1:32:13] Xyletics: dragonflight had a bump, imo, from the new gearing system
[1:32:14] WrathofBambi: consistent is way better
[1:32:15] surpriseparty20: Hell no
[1:32:16] Byggareebob: they keep recycling dungeons but we didnt get anything extra this expansion so where the fuck is the work load going thats the real question.
[1:32:17] Orthobullet: i want it to get worse
[1:32:17] TheUncleJohn: keep in mind that df is not over, and they can make a banger s4
[1:32:18] Durenas: Why Not Both?
[1:32:19] realmattu: you could literally have both
[1:32:23] Morayeden: I prefer thundering to no thundering
[1:32:26] BE3njo: removing borrowed power made this expansion sooo much fucking better, I hated farming ap, story sucks but gameplay is good
[1:32:30] Jazrial: What about the between expansions drop off? Thats gonna feel way less this time
[1:32:30] menzlo: Yep DF ain't over
[1:32:30] HylightShow: start strong stay strong
[1:32:36] Neotahl: The cook might make it bad though if its new
[1:32:37] Sover31gn: If the cook is good though
[1:32:39] Ahrmanhamma: The problem is, you can get super granular with this. Like are we comparing Season to Season, or just the xpac as a whole?
[1:32:40] TheUncleJohn: that would be best imo
[1:32:41] just_ie: @maximum how do you feel about Tindral after the nerfs? Especially now that we have had it for a little bit
[1:32:49] Madgeneto: just start peaking and stay peaking
[1:32:51] Codester_remix: I would like it a little freaky myself
[1:33:01] Sanctos304: how big do metas factor in? didn't bfa have kind of boring metas?
[1:33:05] nalegi07: i wanna see some shadowlands dungeons this fated seaosn 100%
[1:33:10] Madgeneto: just make gaem good
[1:33:11] ZACKandATTACK: I feel like s4 should be for them to get more wild and exploratory with stuff
[1:33:14] tyranade_: i want something like corruption back
[1:33:14] nalegi07: let me blast Halls on current frost mage
[1:33:18] dogmaster9000: the red dot line example was just them holding back obvious fixes until late in the xpac, like legiondaries
[1:33:28] zamoj: 1 pull
[1:33:28] ogbuckwheats: 69
[1:33:28] alexchopstix: 50

[1:33:33] 0_____Kappa: 2
[1:33:35] othernewname: 90
[1:33:37] Keppie__: for who?
[1:33:39] cannibalcanyon: first try for me GIGACHAD
[1:33:39] ncorgi: a little cook allowing us to have access to any tier set and trinkets would be giga
[1:33:40] Dzor12: My guild just got there last Thursday, I'll let you know
[1:33:40] nalegi07: we are 120 in just getting to p2
[1:33:41] disimhi: 1k
[1:33:41] Zzekar: deff not 100 lmao
[1:33:41] Madgeneto: @nalegi07 of atonement? infusion? valor? xdd which halls
[1:33:44] alarkin: Yes it is?
[1:33:46] uprixhd: 200 about
[1:33:47] goombacci: raiding in 2024 ICANT
[1:33:48] m0os31: as a world 500 guild.. still in the 150+
[1:33:49] healapotamus: 4
[1:33:49] Morayeden: Wait til he finds out about Gang Activity.
[1:33:50] joeshmo47: no drop the 0s. just one or two
[1:33:50] Cakerinotv: would take my guild that many LUL
[1:33:50] stuffiexo: 250 FOR SURE
[1:33:51] just_ie: I just killed it today. Took 250 pulls'ish
[1:33:51] Zzekar: max 50
[1:33:51] Finear: ppl starting it now are going for 200-350min
[1:33:51] doublebogey: my guild did 60 pulls first night and got to shield phase once
[1:33:54] Clarius: people are bad max, remember
[1:33:57] Petarglio: it definitely is taking 300 pulls for guilds that started as he got nerfed
[1:33:57] Keppie__: for the guilds hitting it now
[1:33:57] Joneim: People are bad at dodging beams
[1:33:59] Rendlaws: depends how many freedoms u have
[1:34:06] nalegi07: p1 also is the least changed phase after the nerf, p2 is fucking free
[1:34:07] Stephy_Mariee: nerfs dont change that it is pure mechanic vomit lol
[1:34:09] Rendlaws: hard without freeodms
[1:34:16] Korupcija_: true
[1:34:19] Ganryu22: for sure 150 mini, a guild at 6/9MM on my server is already at 100 to reach 60%
[1:34:21] Galarian_Hp: we did one raidday with 52 pulls, didnt fly off with dragons yet
[1:34:21] shaayynee: my guild did 100 pulls in p1 on the first night with a meme comp
[1:34:25] alarkin: Any boss where every single person has responsibility is instantly in the 100s lol
[1:34:26] valarbravoosi: Were corruptions only fun after they lost meaning in any competitiveness?
[1:34:32] HakiThunderFox: @Maximum guilds progging the nerfed boss are far worse than the ones who killed it beforehand so I doubt the pull count changes much
[1:34:36] dumnerd: my guild wiped 74 times on night 1 of tindral
[1:34:38] Ganryu22: and very annying with a ranged compo
[1:34:41] ZACKandATTACK: @Maximum I did 20 wipes in around an hour seeing it for the first time last thursday
[1:34:46] dumnerd: pull count is def inflated by first minute
[1:34:49] Tuoppa: is current season of wow Pog or ass?
[1:35:01] Neotahl: How would you nerf fyrakk?
[1:35:02] b1azzuris: @Tuoppa a lil ass

[1:35:05] malnourish_: hello mr streamer
[1:35:15] othernewname: PEAT Pog
[1:35:18] brosciencegym: talk to growl how hard is gang act is to carried
[1:35:19] Neotahl: Growl is raiding tonight maybe for the last time
[1:35:25] MBG_95: he is on a food break atm
[1:35:27] kakebuts: he's AFK getting food
[1:35:29] Durenas: current season started out Pog and now it's kinda died down so it's kinda ass
[1:35:44] neinskn: are we going only up tn
[1:35:50] othernewname: @Durenas how did it die? lol
[1:35:52] goombacci: Adge
[1:36:04] goombacci: @othernewname he stopped progressing lol
[1:36:07] Durenas: the surge of interest in it is gone, the population is down
[1:36:31] Menethrill: Ads? what ads? BASED
[1:36:37] vuntervunter: Did he forget to press the 'play ad' button?
[1:36:40] alexchopstix: puppers

[1:41:02] mamaloltote: Why dont heroic raid give mythic lvl items in Vault? No way u compare doing a +18 with mythic raiding. But i would compare the difficulty of an 18-20 with heroic raiding. Seems to me like one of the last of the old school way of thougts at blizzard that mythic raiding is and should be the only way to get the good items. Only complaint would be that theres no reason to do mythic. But mythic raiders would get gear faster and most guilds even save there lookout on progression so they dont even get
[1:41:05] just_ie: What i was interested about my Tindral question was: do you still think its as rewarding a fight, or did the nerfs remove a lot of the fun from the fight?
[1:41:06] mamaloltote: the gear from raid
[1:41:11] baconic12: madge no adge

[1:41:26] goombacci: talent into shorter cds
[1:41:41] goombacci: Chatting
[1:41:44] healapotamus: these people progging Tyndral and Fyrakk mythic right now all seem so miserable
[1:41:47] Joneim: We killed it after nerfs, it was still fun
[1:41:48] Benjg7: it felt anticlimactic
[1:41:50] InstaQ: max, what ui you're using? or is it same as atrocity?
[1:41:57] KaisenSiru: triRead triRead triRead
[1:41:57] Nyurro: we progged tindral pre nerf and getting our first kill post nerf felt very underwhelming
[1:41:58] Petarglio: tindral post-nerf is a better fight than pre-nerf
[1:42:00] YugeCrit: Wall of Text = Wrong
[1:42:04] Ephixon: I've just started mythic raiding recently but currently stuck on Tindral which is one of the worst things i've seen, like 4 mechanics at the same time all one shots and there's barely any time between them
[1:42:07] brosciencegym: Talk to grow about his raid last night
[1:42:09] Darkshore_Capital: TRUE
[1:42:10] Benjg7: we progged almost the whole original version, and then killed after the nerf
[1:42:14] garkovankovic: whats your weakaura/addon that shows raid progress of people that sign up to your raid group next to their name? i saw it in your video @Maximum
[1:42:24] JohnAllenCasts: We started Tindral prog basically as nerfs came in. Still progging and it's a really enjoyable boss to pug for us rn. Everyone is enjoying it
[1:42:30] Ruinx81: 18 is fine for one a week imo
[1:42:32] goombacci: and his point is that why does thing thing still remain
[1:42:37] goombacci: this*
[1:42:42] MBG_95: its not the ilvl point, only the fact raid has all the best items I guess?
[1:42:43] ActualTilt: as someone who was in p3 pre nerf, nerfed kill didnt feel good
[1:42:45] bigmeanbeefy: And im so glad, because getting mythic version of trinkets just to be competetive in m+ isnt fun
[1:42:45] ubba90: i havent stepped into mythic raid and im 487 ilvl.
[1:42:47] variareturns: My guild Almighty Push-Proudmoore just killed tindral last thursday and it was extremely satisfying and definitely still challenging
[1:42:49] ubba90: what is max ilvl?
[1:42:49] Cakerinotv: do mythic raiders even care about gear from raid at this point anyway
[1:42:54] baconic12: is it because m+ is spamable so gear cant be as powerful
[1:43:01] goombacci: trinket good is the take
[1:43:02] Scoops__: half cook
[1:43:04] garkovankovic: whats your weakaura/addon that shows raid progress of people that sign up to your raid group next to their name? i saw it in your video @Maximum
[1:43:10] ChefTinyT: hockey
[1:43:12] xrandomdoodx: you do mythic for multiple chances at the highest ilvl gear, instead of just 1 per week
[1:43:14] Meimaris: he talked too much and ended up being wrong
[1:43:14] Therealbrokensword: need some more vity C
[1:43:14] KaisenSiru: Sickge
[1:43:15] Karkesis: he's saying "why not just have heroic raid gear drop on the myth track"
[1:43:15] jerkmcgee: its probably from all the hockey
[1:43:15] TheBroCrow: its cause you make all this sick content
[1:43:16] ghwosttoast: do u go outside
[1:43:16] ChefTinyT: going out to do things with people
[1:43:16] potehoo: i just caught a nasty cold
[1:43:17] southy97: did i miss the m+ list?
[1:43:18] Slapsstick: body might just be worn down
[1:43:19] JackOfAllApocalypses: you're worn out and hanging out in person with more people
[1:43:21] cannibalcanyon: leave the house = get sick
[1:43:21] midiansgod: Hope you feel better soon Max :)
[1:43:24] surpriseparty20: Old age Kappa
[1:43:26] seoris: you still get heroic gear from end of dungeon - 1 mythic piece from vault per week is fine imo
[1:43:31] goombacci: touching grass is dangerous
[1:43:31] Cuore22: are you replenishing the nutrients you're using on hokey?
[1:43:32] YugeCrit: @garkovankovic Better M+
[1:43:32] aurochz: Kappa

[1:43:43] baconic12: we're all getting so old
[1:43:44] Durenas: well oiled flubber
[1:43:48] bigmeanbeefy: @ChefTinyT Yup, for example not dressing well enough afterwards
[1:43:53] kazdeya338: how would you feel about hitting like 3k M+ score allowing M+ players to UG to max ilvl, like an on use token to let your toon upgrade beyond 483
[1:43:53] asd123qwerty1: HAH
[1:43:54] murloc_oracle: he means, hc raid-> myth vault
[1:43:55] Dowson91: I think a full raid clear should up the last vault slot to myth track
[1:44:04] Karkesis: @Dowson91 true
[1:44:04] Ruinx81: 18 pretty hard for some
[1:44:04] Morayeden: For the fun?
[1:44:06] theskot: one 18 for heroic gear
[1:44:07] goombacci: for trinkets
[1:44:17] gwenmh: 18 still harder than like gnarlroot lol
[1:44:22] MBG_95: exactly that
[1:44:22] Pyrrha_GG: only the vault item is mythic
[1:44:33] ZACKandATTACK: That would be so hard for most people
[1:44:37] DecayingPopcorn: late heroic gear wasn't on the highest track before theey added myth?
[1:44:39] healapotamus: people wouldn’t play as much
[1:44:40] Sover31gn: Why does a +8 give the same vault as heroic raid lol
[1:44:43] garkovankovic: @YugeCrit does that not only show the key youve done?
[1:44:44] Camelbak21: even raiders would be mad
[1:44:44] moash_: Don't make me play the minigame more than I have to please
[1:44:44] 16attempts: or just make 20s hard like they were in sl again
[1:44:49] nightman_rl: can confirm, i'd be mad. i dont like m+ enough to do that
[1:44:50] YugeCrit: It is kinda weird that crests start at 16 and myth track starts at 18
[1:44:51] Camelbak21: Most raiders raidlog
[1:44:51] Sanctos304: that'd be great, finally outgear all my shitter raidmates :D
[1:44:53] Saylorr: max what's your favorite flavor of pizza
[1:44:55] Karkesis: make heroic raid vault drop myth track, and normal raid vault drop heroic track
[1:44:55] othernewname: @gwenmh i wouldnt do gnarlroot with 18+ players
[1:44:56] 1cashews1: have +30 drop mythic loot
[1:45:01] iTzMerKiNSeaSoN: so 2 bosses on mythic is the equivalent to a +24?
[1:45:06] goombacci: @1cashews1 ?
[1:45:08] Ruinx81: Who cares lol
[1:45:14] Starship_EU: I disagree. I run heroic raids and getting Mythic Raid equivalent gear for such easy keys is ridiculous
[1:45:22] Itmyfault69: Max can we please get to some pvp content im dying over here
[1:45:23] Scoops__: LMAO
[1:45:29] Cakerinotv: its also the end of the expac so keys scale higher, it might not be that way for expansion start
[1:45:40] goombacci: dokun gard
[1:45:49] Cakerinotv: unless they decide to keep 20's currently how difficult they are going forward
[1:45:52] ThisIzD: i think for the vault its whatever but they should put a myth track in higher keys for drops so you can target pieces if you are good enough to do lets say a 22 and up
[1:45:53] sUb2_w9nDeR: why be mad, thats how it should be, i know for a fact I'm not made not good enough to be a mythic raider, and its a slap in the face to raiders that i can rip a couple of keys and get myth gear @Maximum thoughts?
[1:45:59] RoboMaximillion: lol
[1:46:03] faythes68: doesn't bricking a 24 still give you vault loot but wiping without killing the boss doesn't give you vault loot?
[1:46:04] aurochz: PauseChamp

[1:48:49] alexchopstix: pvp is so fucking boring
[1:48:50] raizoontv: Hmmm but do you think getting the hang of it wouldn't be fun to you? My train of thought was that you would enjoy the competetive aspect of it being challenging - on the other side pvp sucks  delete it
[1:48:53] TheBroCrow: my man must have raged hard in chat KEKW
[1:49:00] goombacci: @Starship_EU instant dollars has tons of old liquid raiders

[1:57:38] Stephy_Mariee: fuck vexamus
[1:57:39] Cakerinotv: at least it was at the start
[1:57:39] miraagex: AA best DF, contender for best of all times
[1:57:39] PurpleKami: vex for healing is heart attack inducing
[1:57:41] ZACKandATTACK: JB is traumatized from explosive on tree trash

[1:58:30] flutey_: jb right
[1:58:35] sirch1: The 2nd boss of Neltharus is the worst boss in this expansion, shit was bugged every other run
[1:58:37] Morayeden: BASED
[1:58:39] aurochz: baseg  󠀀
[1:58:40] Montiguy: @maximum i think they should have all the dungeons in for season 4. But have all the keys have 3 different dungeon. That way it wont be very hard to get specific keys. Score would be based on the top 8 dungeons.
[1:58:41] Tehblured: JB is 100% right
[1:58:45] ThisIzD: Let JB cook
[1:58:48] Tehblured: AA is dog
[1:58:48] miraagex: LoS was shit code, should've never worked like that

[2:00:02] neinskn: jb is a great cooker
[2:00:04] Karkesis: the s3 healer trinket drama with nerfing Rashok's
[2:00:12] WingedChipmunk: @Maximum what about Bird boss just randomly resetting?
[2:00:18] williwhite94: ive learned so much from this stream and this chat about PVE THANK YOU MATES
[2:00:31] Petarglio: there was also that adaptive swarm bug that would softlock you on the birds
[2:00:35] Zzekar: so Algethar just becasue of the massive pull and the overall looks of it ...
[2:00:40] MBG_95: timer was also very tight
[2:00:46] Mordento: birds getting bugged
[2:00:46] Petarglio: but al'gethar is still very good
[2:00:49] Buboniks: AA is a solid A
[2:00:58] Galarian_Hp: also u had to fix spellqueue on vex by letting an orb in, which most pugs didnt know
[2:00:58] miraagex: Algethar was cool because it let you choose boss order + MASSIVE aoe pull that requires little to no CC
[2:01:00] Karkesis: tree boss and last boss were good
[2:01:00] fzybny: JB is right, but it's probably a good B.
[2:01:06] nostreamerstream: tree bos sucked
[2:01:06] M3xM: very very solid A for me
[2:01:11] WingedChipmunk: Craw literally wouldn't spawn and fucked the entire dungoen
[2:01:13] pinkbox: A for now
[2:01:14] Rebizle: Rebizle subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 6 months! I'm STILL bricked up
[2:01:21] M3xM: it's not S for me because of shitty last boss
[2:01:21] jandemain: tree boss was cursed before nerfs
[2:01:23] miraagex: @Aaspect10 found the one who failed movements KEKW
[2:01:23] Sinergy_57: Tree boss was good because you could pump the shit out of it KEKW
[2:01:26] Darkminst: last boss is a tank n spank
[2:01:27] Galarian_Hp: tree boss without poison dispell xD
[2:01:30] M3xM: if AA had better final boss, it would move up to S
[2:01:35] Joneim: Into the corner RAGEY
[2:01:51] Morayeden: This ain't sounding like a S tier
[2:01:52] Hunter__Thie: @miraagex IMO uldaman is trash, RLP was poorly tunned once you went up it became hell, Nelth is boring. The rest are fun
[2:01:58] TommySeeker: and last boss randomly had the fastest frontal breath ever
[2:02:01] drackene: Trash was good on AA
[2:02:05] othernewname: the dungeon was cool cause u could get free stats :)
[2:02:19] Rebizle: The bird boss was insane on tyran if you are shit (like me)
[2:02:24] CussenFlussPruttButt: the jumpy mobs were crazy for trash on high fort

[2:10:08] chrono_za: guy at door DonoWall
[2:10:20] JohnAllenCasts: Like if you're only running one dungeon over and over because it's the easiest, that's a balance problem in the other dungeons in the season

[2:11:43] QuokkaEnjoyer: S for poolS
[2:11:44] Buboniks: D for duby
[2:11:44] tweetv_: RLP is really fun but the bosses were insanely hard for pugs 20+
[2:11:45] Cakerinotv: its a hard dugneon but i never hated it
[2:11:46] fzybny: D, trash
[2:11:47] miraagex: AA/RLP/AV must be same tier
[2:11:48] damacraze: already broke it with court, after AA its AV
[2:11:50] Xyletics: Last boss was annoying
[2:11:52] WingedChipmunk: bosses were INSANE though

[2:12:04] Sover31gn: Last boss can go fuck itself

[2:12:16] kj01a: RBL was S tier if you like nascar
[2:12:19] Darkminst: This dungeon is the reason why i hate S1
[2:12:19] tweetv_: thats a good take

[2:12:36] miraagex: @GrimFandango @othernewname they literally hotfixed it in first 3 weeks. Did you play s1?
[2:12:38] Ruidego1875: When pugging it was either pretty easy , or ABSOLUTE hell
[2:12:46] fzybny: 1 wipe and it was most likely a bricked key too.
[2:12:46] goombacci: yes on the other hand if you are a dps with a bad healer its terrible
[2:12:49] chrono_za: healer talking GoodTake
[2:12:50] othernewname: @miraagex yes was still hard
[2:13:25] goombacci: yes the anduin treatment
[2:13:27] Cakerinotv: The thing is I never dreaded doing this dungeon for whatever reason
[2:13:32] miraagex: @othernewname the only hard parts of it were dodging the rolling meteor and last boss fire kiting. the rest is git gud material
[2:13:48] Xanctius: it was definitately a dungeon
[2:13:50] Karkesis: it was super stressful to heal
[2:13:54] goombacci: that made it unbearable as dps where you just hope healer is good
[2:14:21] WingedChipmunk: Probably the most fun i've had healing all xpac with this dungeon and MW was no where near as good in S1
[2:14:30] Morayeden: When healers found out they hate healing
[2:14:44] Starship_EU: Legit
[2:14:47] miraagex: Healers doing dps is cringe. Just play dps lol.
[2:14:47] klondike_wow: week 1 thundercock Aware
[2:14:59] tweetv_: last boss on pres evoker was miserable because of the range
[2:15:00] Karkesis: last boss with dot/interrupting shout/quaking overlap Aware

[2:15:10] tweetv_: people sprint away w 1 shotty debuffs in different directions
[2:15:12] Sover31gn: It had a stop cast as well it can go die
[2:15:14] Ruidego1875: @Karkesis yes ahahah
[2:15:18] Cakerinotv: @miraagex or if the meatball got caught on the curbs of the sidewalk LUL

[2:16:19] visibly_riley: z
[2:16:21] Sover31gn: Last boss had a stop cast cant be A
[2:16:22] lessahj: I think the perception of dungeon difficulty changed with the introduction of the gearing system. It's difficult to compare S1 with S2 and onwards.
[2:16:25] kaychixo: swamp ass tbh
[2:16:26] goombacci: soys cant do tree boss and put AA in A ICANT
[2:16:27] pflipz: not putting ruby and algethar in the same tier

[2:16:46] othernewname: skip dragon or not HOLY options
[2:16:47] nekitamocika: Those mini boss dragons were so boring
[2:16:48] Ruinx81: Ruby was crap man, bosses overturned af
[2:16:49] Camelbak21: There are no fun pulls in ruby, only small shitter obs with mobs that has 10 mechanics
[2:16:51] Clush___: @Camelbak21 you suck bitch

[2:17:37] miraagex: @Camelbak21 you had to do massive first pull with invis pot skipping first dude to make it on the timer. You pulled like half the room with casters
[2:17:38] NoTimeToThink: even now people still do ruby life pools when the 4 mythic weekly pops up
[2:17:44] Alarius_: people are way too generous with S tier
[2:17:44] guynormally: xdd
[2:17:44] Faraday5001: baseg

[2:26:40] Alarius_: lame
[2:26:40] larkhill: it felt unnecessary
[2:26:47] jugajuice: I think without thundering a lotta the S1 dungeons should be better now; lotta the mechanic overlaps left a bad taste in a lotta folks' mouth
[2:26:47] Lindorn_: it was fine
[2:26:54] Kerelinn7: dragonriding was completely fine, its not really any different from regular walking
[2:26:55] Ruidego1875: The dragon riding part was pointless imo , as the guy said it was pointless you were forced to go a route anyway
[2:27:00] othernewname: only the affixes which made u not fly...
[2:27:01] Ruinx81: The trash was rough
[2:27:01] fzybny: Until you get someone that rides like Driney...
[2:27:01] cendaiii: agreed
[2:27:04] pedrodaboch4: nokhud was A tier , the packs were great
[2:27:05] Alarius_: everybody just had to do that skip to the end boss too
[2:27:06] CussenFlussPruttButt: @Maximum the dragonriding was awesome
[2:27:06] Stephy_Mariee: there were a lot of people that got dcd while dragonriding and it bricked your key.. lol
[2:27:07] Faraday5001: bad on spiteful
[2:27:07] Desmora: It was fine, especially once routing was done for last boss entry
[2:27:09] 4nn4n45: ppl not being able to make it above the fence in the last area
[2:27:13] Lindorn_: LUL
[2:27:13] tobbs94: following the tank is kinda annoying with the dragon riding
[2:27:13] OG_Kawngi: Stare open up
[2:27:19] Madgeneto: yea that part was unnecessarily cringe
[2:27:34] dango0n: S4 is hype
[2:27:36] miraagex: s4 Bedge
[2:27:39] rustycans: oh god
[2:27:46] yrp01: God please not
[2:27:46] othernewname: ye  they fixed the dungeon
[2:27:46] Sweepstakes86: Oh no you have to do the frogs...
[2:27:47] rustycans: Imagine playing s4 KEKW
[2:27:48] tylxrwow: tylxrwow subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 3 months! 
[2:27:51] kazdeya338: B-tier overall, c tier for the shitty affixes we still had that had raidwipe overlaps
[2:27:54] Sover31gn: AV jump made the dungeon much more fun with that option
[2:27:55] JohnAllenCasts: it was super ass with the bug that kept you stuck in combat. You release during a pull becuase someone missed a kick and then you're all the way across the map and it's GG on a high key because you can't get back
[2:27:56] aurochz: monkaW
[2:28:00] fzybny: Oh god, AV skip was the only reason it was good
[2:28:01] surpriseparty20: Let fly NotLikeThis
[2:28:11] miraagex: EZ 100$ save not playing s4
[2:28:20] RayWoz: if that rock didnt exist on the last boss it would be D tier
[2:28:38] LennyD52: B
[2:28:39] ismoot: B
[2:28:40] Suited_Monkey: F
[2:28:40] Madgeneto: should be F just for that, but overall id say B
[2:28:56] nekitamocika: Solid B
[2:28:56] Gobbomb: Wait, why did shadowmoon get an F?
[2:28:58] arxi0: lets be real its C at best
[2:29:02] tobbs94: c
[2:29:05] rustycans: nokhud was absolutely horrible, so many spells
[2:29:05] shadowreath93: B for good aoe packs :]
[2:29:06] fzybny: Should be D
[2:29:10] zeitgeistfr: really dynamic packs !
[2:29:12] draconisraccoonis: @Gobbomb because it sucks
[2:29:17] JackOfAllApocalypses: definitely better than court, definitely not on AA/RLP/HoV level, B looks right
[2:29:18] Jormungandr_NW: @Gobbomb S for npc, F for high pushers
[2:29:18] Thor_R: Yeah C
[2:29:27] Gobbomb: @Gobbomb Gotcha
[2:29:30] Ruidego1875: Quacking.... last boss pulling u in was absolute a deplete sometimes
[2:29:33] goombacci: EB lol
[2:29:35] arxi0: way too many negatives to be higher than C
[2:29:35] Madgeneto: come on its better than cos
[2:29:36] Buboniks: raging fortified o.O
[2:29:36] nick08_wow: azzure vault with thundering was the worst
[2:29:37] Kerelinn7: quaking wiping you was hilarious
[2:29:39] damacraze: explosive before first boss made or broke the key
[2:29:42] Is_Hamm: The EB of season 1
[2:29:42] kazdeya338: bro getting quaked after the last boss suck mech?
[2:29:42] miraagex: @Gobbomb it was rated S by beginner players who did baby keys, but it was shit in high keys
[2:29:43] visibly_riley: catching your ghost in big AOE can also suck it
[2:29:46] Madgeneto: OMEGALUL
[2:29:51] Madgeneto: RIPBOZO QUAKING
[2:29:53] Thor_R: True D
[2:29:55] damacraze: AV getting invisible death walls to skips makes it easy F
[2:29:55] nekitamocika: AV 3rd boss quaking KEKW
[2:29:55] Morayeden: S
[2:29:58] CoffeeASAP: rock S tier

[2:30:11] minglium: B
[2:30:12] kazdeya338: D
[2:30:12] nekitamocika: AV was hardest dng most of season
[2:30:12] damacraze: F
[2:30:14] Sover31gn: S
[2:30:14] Suited_Monkey: wtf, AV is F tier
[2:30:15] peinen: AV is not better than AA...
[2:30:16] oqqiH: sickest fucking route and grew on a lot of people
[2:30:16] Kinzarro: B
[2:30:18] Darkminst: Last boss is criminal and shouldnt be in the game
[2:30:18] fzybny: Better than AA, it was great
[2:30:19] ZordiakZero: AV with skip A, without skip D
[2:30:19] dango0n: Last boss was ass
[2:30:20] LennyD52: A
[2:30:21] Morayeden: AA is bad
[2:30:21] santalylth: s
[2:30:23] santalylth: tier
[2:30:24] CoffeeASAP: joker moment incoming
[2:30:24] larkhill: if even jdotb likes it, its an S
[2:30:26] MVPBuster: AV was only saved due to the jump skip
[2:30:27] Madgeneto: ???
[2:30:27] Petarglio: you have to move AA up to S
[2:30:30] Kenpachi724: AZURE FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFUCK IT
[2:30:30] Alarius_: zero checkpoints
[2:30:32] ubba90: AV was great until they fixed the wall skip for the frog zone
[2:30:33] skluer: if you could have mount it would be S
[2:30:34] rustycans: So much running and you have to do weird ass skips
[2:30:34] goombacci: classic chat unable to do mechs thinking aa is bad
[2:30:35] damacraze: it was only high because of the skips imo
[2:30:38] fzybny: The skip made this dungeon, skipping all the frogs
[2:30:39] Ruidego1875: When the skip was done this dungeon was way better imo
[2:30:41] Jamcal: Put Academy in S NOW!!!
[2:30:41] JoaEUW: SKIP RUN = S TIER, NORMAL RUN = C TIER <3 <3
[2:30:42] atamdev: A is fine but it sure as hell aint S
[2:30:43] Alarius_: you cannot put that in A tier, its so long and if you wiped it was MISERABLE
[2:30:44] nekitamocika: Nah AV was unplayable for half of season
[2:30:45] Suited_Monkey: Yeah, F tier for so much running
[2:30:45] Lindorn_: the civilians are getting rowdy
[2:30:46] Zwizzie: Hey Max can you link the tier list?
[2:30:49] miraagex: @goombacci BASED
[2:30:50] Madgeneto: not A
[2:30:58] custom025: AA not being S is a war crime
[2:30:59] SkirsdagTv: SKIP RUN = S TIER, NORMAL RUN = C TIER
[2:31:01] yrp01: It was A with the Skip KEKW
[2:31:09] sly20193: S
[2:31:12] sly20193: SS
[2:31:13] sly20193: S
[2:31:14] sly20193: SS
[2:31:15] baseboned: yaaaaaaaaaa
[2:31:16] Nitruos: we're also seeing the civilians hate this dungeon probably, i hated it lol
[2:31:16] sly20193: SSS
[2:31:19] whoknowsdude_: bro I remember you used to game thundering in the last boss to avoid the slow dot thing
[2:31:20] Faraday5001: cant be S cos of 3rd boss
[2:31:22] damacraze: A with skip but F without skip
[2:31:28] naro1089: AA not being S is throwing us all off
[2:31:32] Razah675: Are they rating with or without the skip till in it?
[2:31:46] goombacci: @naro1089 real and true
[2:31:47] CussenFlussPruttButt: @Maximum I got my AV portal bc of that retroactive change lol
[2:31:49] Matorey: So bummed I missed M+ all of season 1 :(
[2:31:51] nekitamocika: 1st pull with bolstering KEKW
[2:31:54] Ruidego1875: @Razah675 I think its rated as a whole , From start to bottom
[2:32:01] xMysuki: eeew, azure vault and ruby life are both trash. Not gonna miss those
[2:32:08] oqqiH: it felt like if you wanted to save time or catch up you could for sure do it on this dungeon
[2:32:21] dango0n: the only way algethar shouldnt be S is if their was a DDDD tier.
[2:32:29] goombacci: real
[2:32:32] Karkesis: yes
[2:32:32] Rick_Haus: explosive week on AA specifically S+ tier
[2:32:38] minglium: the second boss is miserable.
[2:32:45] Madgeneto: common jb W
[2:32:46] Razah675: @Ruidego1875 The skip/jump down was deleted after season 1 so no one has done M+ with it.
[2:32:48] nekitamocika: Nah 2nd boss was annoying af
[2:32:49] JoaEUW: SKIP RUN = S TIER, FROG RUN = C TIER
[2:32:50] Paleee_: @Maximum 2nd boss XD
[2:32:51] elbinn: @Maximum toads were dumb af
[2:32:52] damacraze: what about without skips?
[2:32:52] dango0n: Last 2 bosses were ass ngl
[2:32:54] KampJyden: You cant
[2:32:54] othernewname: the walking is a bit too much tho
[2:33:00] goombacci: civvies cant even do the skip
[2:33:05] JFUNKGAMING: Are we rating Azure Vault with the consideration of the S3 changes to it (can't jump off platform?)
[2:33:07] atamdev: last boss really wasnt good either
[2:33:10] damacraze: @Razah675 the skip death walls were added right before s3
[2:33:11] fzybny: AV > AA, it was always fun.
[2:33:16] lordex1919: i mean last boss on tyran was a fucking disgrace
[2:33:16] Feverdreams_0_: that start is gonna be so ez with new VDH next season
[2:33:17] chasen218: SBG F why?
[2:33:17] Sweepstakes86: Dorki im sure still has frog nightmares
[2:33:18] OlaF_oo: the ice boss was dog water (3. boss)
[2:33:19] Ruidego1875: @Razah675 Huh? U could jump down when it was active in m+ for sure
[2:33:20] nekitamocika: Bosses kinda sucked in this dng
[2:33:24] ZordiakZero: If AV is S tier, so is AA
[2:33:30] miraagex: Civs didnt do first full two rooms instead of jump. 2nd pull with wall LoSing was quite hard (for me in pugs)
[2:33:41] KampJyden: You cant do the jump down anymore tho in AV
[2:33:44] Razah675: @Ruidego1875 Not anymore.
[2:33:53] Sweepstakes86: @chasen218 because we're just scrubs who like easy dungeons according to people
[2:33:56] ubba90: LOLOL people gonna be upset when they find out they do atal wrong
[2:33:58] reeekus: before the skip was known, doing the frog packs sucked
[2:34:01] Ruidego1875: @Razah675 Ah ye they changed it now , But  when it was active in the pool u could do it
[2:34:05] TBouse: i think pugs are more scared of the juggernauts tbh
[2:34:10] goombacci: and AA gave you a buff of your choosing?
[2:34:11] Rick_Haus: 2 kicks = 4 kicks and someone baiting btw
[2:34:16] weezull: baseg

[2:34:52] damacraze: can you ask what would you rate it without the skips?
[2:34:58] Darkminst: AV last boss makes me wanna shootmyself so AA
[2:35:07] gonzobone: gonzobone subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 9 months! dragonflight dungeons were great
[2:35:08] Spartany25: still think shadowmoon and court should switch
[2:35:12] KaLYes: Court C ?
[2:35:13] zzzDai: HoV has no place in A tier lol
[2:35:16] KaLYes: it was fun one
[2:35:19] CoffeeASAP: we're not done PepeLaugh
[2:35:28] miraagex: @SmellyStrobes do you understand where are you now and who are you watching? those guys are competetive and discussing high keys, not your civ 20-21
[2:35:28] Nitruos: i dont know many that hate algethar

[2:36:12] 1_7_4: the dungeon shouldnt be built around chains @Maximum
[2:36:13] 1_7_4: its shit
[2:36:13] m_dep: i had a blast with nelth
[2:36:16] ZordiakZero: Nelth D, or F
[2:36:18] Durenas: Neltharus trash is ResidentSleeper
[2:36:19] baseboned: chains isn't that big a deal
[2:36:19] m_dep: why is anybody saying nelth is bad? wtf?
[2:36:20] custom025: I think nelth is actually the worst dungeon ive ever done
[2:36:22] general__M: environmental damage gimmicks in 2023 AINTNOWAY

[2:36:27] miraagex: @SmellyStrobes i mean, they discuss things that literally 0.1% of the players can relate to
[2:36:27] Feverdreams_0_: Neltharus was ass, F tier
[2:36:28] Grissu_: F, while fighting with trash mobs I forgot what year it was
[2:36:32] nick08_wow: if youre sayiong nelth was f just cause of chains you are so biased
[2:36:34] 1_7_4: Z
[2:36:37] larkhill: they made a dungeon where big pulls could be done and found a way to make it unfun
[2:36:37] sgtmuffi: Only dungeons i legit hated were Halls and fucking uldaman
[2:36:46] Petarglio: chains were such a bad mechanic
[2:36:47] KaLYes: are they basing their opinion on how they feel on +15 or +30 ?
[2:36:52] Rick_Haus: chains are dogshit automatic F tier
[2:36:54] NeccoTL: I like it
[2:36:55] DutchGameLab: Adge
[2:36:58] malavander: having to do so much backtracking and weird cliff drops seems like bad level design
[2:36:59] Jormungandr_NW: chains was fun the timer was kinda tight for me being bad
[2:37:04] 1_7_4: YEP
[2:37:08] Eredun89: 3 min ad, NO
[2:37:13] NeccoTL: I like the idea of chains
[2:37:14] SmellyStrobes: @miraagex which the rest of the playerbase then parrots for months lol
[2:37:15] GrimFandango: Nelth is a mega F tier for me
[2:37:15] goombacci: @KaLYes tbh 30+
[2:37:16] vuntervunter: I had to mute for SBG - why was it a straight F?
[2:37:20] MBG_95: The chains became a thing weeks in, the Chains used to almost Kill you when you picked them up
[2:37:30] Morayeden: @vuntervunter Bad in every way
[2:37:41] inhumanlty: neltharus reminds me necrotic wake
[2:37:45] goombacci: @vuntervunter because very very high level players had to do it a lot
[2:37:49] KaLYes: @goombacci then this tierlist wont be that good to look at
[2:37:53] NeccoTL: I'd give it a B at least
[2:37:57] miraagex: @KaLYes like 30+ yeah
[2:37:59] zzzDai: Chains used to like instant kill you for using them, but they buffed them partly through
[2:38:05] Sover31gn: F

[2:38:36] Karkesis: Day 1 brackenhide was complete dogshit
[2:38:36] elbinn: it was the best M+ dungeon in the new DF ones imo
[2:38:38] goombacci: @larkhill ICANT
[2:38:38] Petarglio: Bracken is easy S
[2:38:40] Feverdreams_0_: ***e fact that you have two paths, but can only ever go one way.. huge drawback
[2:38:41] MBG_95: you cannot pull half of the trash?
[2:38:49] zzzDai: S except for last boss
[2:38:49] 1_7_4: ICANT

[2:39:06] Kerelinn7: is was terrible because of the routing
[2:39:06] Durenas: i hate how much dispelling i have to do in it
[2:39:10] goombacci: yeah spamming it for my tank trinket wasnt that bad
[2:39:11] TauruSkeleton: fuck the spinny boys
[2:39:13] leubinator: brackenhide as melee Despairge
[2:39:13] goombacci: would spam again
[2:39:14] Petarglio: only issue with brackenhide was the annoying haste disease, other than that it was really good
[2:39:17] Armagaren: the tree boss was pretty silly
[2:39:31] healhawt: it wasnt that bad to heal
[2:39:35] Sohen: first boss in there was a pug killer
[2:39:36] larkhill: as a ret, tree boss was fine
[2:39:36] Sohen: dungeon sucked
[2:39:39] LennyD52: B .
[2:39:44] chanpa: better than nokhud for sure
[2:39:45] Kinzarro: C
[2:39:46] goombacci: B then
[2:39:49] JohnAllenCasts: season 2 dungeons were all tainted by the god comp
[2:39:57] ogbuckwheats: bracken hide was great
[2:39:58] goombacci: @JohnAllenCasts real and true
[2:40:00] Team_Spanky: Above Nokhud 100%
[2:40:04] SmellyStrobes: I cannot see BH being worse than NO
[2:40:04] MBG_95: Last boss needs a re-design and half the trash needs reviewing, but overall fun
[2:40:04] Ruinx81: B, as way better than Ruby
[2:40:09] Morayeden: JB is cooking. He has changed my opinion. A
[2:40:13] Durenas: tree boss was ok, hunter boss was ok last boss was ok trash was annoying, routing was annoying, debuffs were annoying
[2:40:25] RayWoz: brackenhide showed me how dumb dps are. insane amount of keys bricked bc they dont kill the totems last boss
[2:40:33] healhawt: BB
[2:40:35] vuntervunter: I'm ready for the F hammer to fall on Uld
[2:40:37] Feverdreams_0_: can't be A if you never go one whole path of the dungeon
[2:40:53] SmellyStrobes: the runback was cancer, yeah
[2:41:03] andaroo: It's a C to me, the ramping from boss to boss felt weird (first and last hardest), whole dungeon was awkward
[2:41:04] LennyD52: last boss was not fun.
[2:41:07] miraagex: @RayWoz same currently on 3rd boss TotT tyran
[2:41:09] Durenas: ugh f stinkrot

[2:42:09] Kinzarro: yo wot
[2:42:19] iMuru: how did i never know that AINTNOWAY
[2:42:20] Morayeden: Routing is important.
[2:42:23] RayWoz: @miraagex yeah like the only way to lose the key was not kill the totems. and they will not use cd's on it
[2:42:26] Feverdreams_0_: @goombacci it's not a matter of skipping it. But if you make a dungeon with two choices, but one is actually useable
[2:42:27] minglium: A
[2:42:29] JohnAllenCasts: it is for sure better than NO
[2:42:33] Marriak: wtf u got this list upside down or smth

[2:42:38] pinkbox: brh > no

[2:42:48] d0mezg4mer: its A
[2:42:53] miraagex: GS goes BRRR
[2:42:59] 10000watts: i could never do nokhud again and i would be better off for it
[2:42:59] Durenas: Uldaman is LOST IN TIME
[2:43:01] ArcticFortune: Hecking loved only hitting lashers with my cleave as fury in bracken LUL cmonBruh
[2:43:05] panser_nes: bracken went hard as a weekly key
[2:43:09] GrimFandango: the totems on last boss were so dumb dude...

[2:44:37] ungnyaa: random cleaves, random bleeds, shit bosses

[2:45:38] larkhill: any boss that lets me aoe is ok in my book
[2:45:43] getzookie: getzookie subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 8 months! 
[2:45:45] RakknorR: emberon was fun using spell reflect if timed right
[2:45:50] Scoops__: Hi-C
[2:45:54] ZordiakZero: C is pretty fair for uldaman
[2:45:54] Camelbak21: But court was so wholesome

[2:46:11] Pool_boyQ: Azure Vault A is insane
[2:46:11] JohnAllenCasts: it's too long to be a dungeon though
[2:46:13] Karkesis: the vikings sucked but they were easy and first so it didn't matter
[2:46:17] clootz: What's the context for the tier list? How fun they were?

[2:47:44] RakknorR: i liked 3rd boss
[2:47:45] SmellyStrobes: I want to like HoI bc theme and aesthetic, but....
[2:47:48] AoPsyke: worst runback
[2:47:51] Morayeden: 2 min run back...
[2:47:51] blacklight_____: the first 3 bosses are solid
[2:47:54] pflipz: I would run 100 sbg before 1 halls of infusion
[2:47:58] d0pesickehg: F imo
[2:47:58] ungnyaa: @miraagex wdym challenge it's a dogshit fight with like 3 mechanics it's just bad
[2:48:03] Armagaren: the dragons........
[2:48:04] minglium: D
[2:48:05] Byggareebob: @pflipz everyone would
[2:48:05] JohnAllenCasts: you cannot have SBG in F and NOT put HoI in F tier as well. that's criminal
[2:48:06] Scoops__: i hope they never bring this dungeon back
[2:48:08] sgtmuffi: @pflipz Yes
[2:48:08] Thatguy8795: Last boss so annoying
[2:48:14] Armagaren: last boss feels incredibly bad
[2:48:22] tobbs94: i think im the only one who liked hoi LUL
[2:48:23] Kayjin1223: HoI is an F
[2:48:26] Armagaren: frog was funny at least
[2:48:29] Cakerinotv: 3rd boss is a great boss
[2:48:30] Morayeden: Last boss is so garbage
[2:48:31] miraagex: @ungnyaa we have different perspective. in my opinion all mythic raid bosses should be equally hard and be like jailer/anduin/tindral
[2:48:34] Spartany25: The guantlet wasn't bad. But spawning at the beginning in a newly designed dungeon should be illegal
[2:48:37] Cakerinotv: the gauntlet and last boss is ass
[2:48:37] Kenpachi724: didn't wanna do any of the trash in it D for sure
[2:48:39] Karkesis: most of the dungeon is okay imo but the run back after wiping and the last boss bring it waaaay down
[2:48:41] preyerzz: pugged 3200 no god comp and halls was so toxic
[2:48:41] sethron: it's way worse than SBG
[2:48:54] Kayjin1223: 3rd boss was good but the rest of that place belongs in the garbage.
[2:48:58] ungnyaa: @miraagex and how is that relevant to 3 dwarves putting fire on the ground
[2:49:05] zapdead: HoI is an F tier dungeon, nothing about it is enjoyable
[2:49:13] jpacoelho: HOA is quite bad. U release at beginning always
[2:49:13] Sweepstakes86: no one ever used the engy thing
[2:49:14] othernewname: KEKW
[2:49:15] Morayeden: DPS brain
[2:49:17] whoknowsdude_: the cheat death yeah
[2:49:19] Faraday5001: huh
[2:49:21] aurochz: max so aggressive KEKW
[2:49:22] chimeraxst: @Maximum 3rd 3rd boss was bad on incorp and afflicted week cause they always spawned on glaciers  100 yards out
[2:49:26] sgtmuffi: uldaman is worse imo
[2:49:27] blacklight_____: @Sweepstakes86 every high key group went left
[2:49:27] miraagex: @ungnyaa we talked about how some people like easy content and some not
[2:49:28] lordex1919: there was a hole on the right side u could use after u wiped kek
[2:49:41] bschs1: my guild just died sadge
[2:49:45] miraagex: Underrot EZ A

[2:49:59] othernewname: C
[2:50:01] yrp01: I hate the underrot vibe KEKW
[2:50:01] atamdev: GOATED dungeon
[2:50:02] ungnyaa: @miraagex you said the first boss of uldaman is hard when it's like every dungeon boss just designed for droolers
[2:50:02] jpacoelho: Underrot B
[2:50:02] Sleicreider: Halls irideus fragment farm f
[2:50:05] nick08_wow: you cant put underrot in s and not AA or RLP KEKW
[2:50:06] regular_rusty: underrot = F-
[2:50:07] Kinzarro: 2nd boss is dogshit
[2:50:08] GrimFandango: Dude fromm a pug perspective, UR is a legit D. 2nd boss people failed at every key level
[2:50:09] Ristvakbaen1911: Crawg boss is AIDS tho imo on Tyran
[2:50:11] sethron: B
[2:50:12] fzybny: UR and FH both S, just slam it.
[2:50:13] Sweepstakes86: Funderrot rules all
[2:50:14] pflipz: underrot above algethar this aint it
[2:50:14] leubinator: crackmaw sucks donkeydick
[2:50:15] Spartany25: not S for me, but I get why people would love it
[2:50:17] Petarglio: underrot is really good but no way it's above AA
[2:50:17] JohnAllenCasts: the underrot tube skip was crazy. Doing last boss first was just a big ego statement
[2:50:19] MetamineB: i dont get why people love the bfa dungeons so much
[2:50:20] i_cassius: Got the underot mount from Rise :D
[2:50:27] Morayeden: The mob placement change was bad
[2:50:29] blacklight_____: underrot is definitely A not S
[2:50:30] zapdead: @d0mezg4mer How? The dungeon was in the rotation last season, so it cant be nostalgia.
[2:50:30] tobbs94: b the frontal mobs suck
[2:50:31] malavander: Underrot too visually noisy, v cool but v hard to see stuff
[2:50:33] miraagex: @ungnyaa no, u mistook my for another person LUL I was talking to another guy about why dungeons have "wierd" order for people who do 10-15 keys
[2:50:33] Spartany25: @pflipz agree
[2:50:34] Xyletics: 2nd boss as DK was awful
[2:50:38] Cabs_Gaming: anyone not saying S has PTSD from crawg
[2:50:42] regular_rusty: underrotten
[2:50:42] eveecat: second boss prevents it from being S tier for me
[2:50:42] sellenia94: Crawg was so difficult in pugs.
[2:50:43] SmellyStrobes: @i_cassius grats, jealous
[2:50:50] Soupas_: bring back maw of souls
[2:50:53] Darkminst: Not a big fan but understandable take
[2:50:57] stuffiexo: this tier list is awful, no way those dragonflight dungeons are above D tier
[2:50:59] eyeztea: underrot F just like shadowmmon
[2:51:07] TBouse: 1st boss had a soft enrage before they changed it lol
[2:51:11] ungnyaa: underrot just boring
[2:51:11] tubuzor: Bfa dungeons were bangers
[2:51:12] leubinator: crackmaw absolutly murderd pugs worst boss ever
[2:51:12] miraagex: Underrot was awesome because I'm better than average play at moving and casting, so I was poppingo off EZ
[2:51:15] MoleDude: the mob change was bad but dungeon still good
[2:51:15] selliondk: stink
[2:51:19] Karkesis: @malavander that's how I feel about Freehold, mechanically fine but the visual clutter is overwhelming
[2:51:20] SmellyStrobes: Freehold was not nearly as good as I'd remembered in BFA tbh
[2:51:22] i_cassius: @i_cassius good wishes in your next Rise
[2:51:23] JayDubbss: last boss in pugs was SO BAD
[2:51:23] DigoCapiroto: underrot above algethar... Absolute madman
[2:51:25] tobbs94: last boss is boring af and last mobs suck, rest is good so B
[2:51:27] atamdev: Slightly worse than the BFA version but still an S tier dungeon
[2:51:49] miraagex: I hated Underrot at start, but later when I actually the bosses
[2:51:50] razortanktv: this tier list is wack. HoI being above SBG?
[2:51:53] miraagex: but loved later*
[2:52:31] SgtBigCactus: underrot blows, @me
[2:52:34] Morayeden: @razortanktv SBG was a crime

[3:00:42] WingedChipmunk: D tier
[3:00:44] Durenas: B just because there's nothing special about it
[3:00:47] Darkminst: pugging VP trying to explain what the 2nd boss does PepeLaugh
[3:00:51] Petarglio: VP is unironically A tier, way overhated
[3:00:52] locokute: everbloom likes a word right now
[3:00:52] minglium: the big adds in the beginning
[3:00:55] MatrixFlowPro: VP Big F
[3:00:56] miraagex: @Darkminst it was hilarious
[3:00:56] GrimFandango: damn F seems harsh
[3:00:58] Pado99: wait wtf i loved VP
[3:01:03] a_oshi: LOWER THAN F PLEASE
[3:01:06] Starship_EU: nooo S baby!
[3:01:06] Vikinick: I like when dungeons have a boss mechanic where you can spell reflect and that's basically the only redeeming quality
[3:01:09] Kinzarro: Shadowmoon was more fun than vortex
[3:01:12] selliondk: the jumping adds that u made headbutt into the wall is always a good design decision
[3:01:14] Madgeneto: fine if tank tanks it close for melee
[3:01:16] Karkesis: it's fine
[3:01:17] bullyybeef: Halls had a lot more negatives imo
[3:01:19] fzybny: No shot, SBG had better trash and bosses, VP was the worst dungeon of the expansion.
[3:01:24] cliche_cat: F is too low
[3:01:24] GrumblyMike: warriors spell reflect and ignore mechanic
[3:01:31] Scoops__: it gives people personal responsibility outside of a kick kind of interesting
[3:01:38] Morayeden: Yes
[3:01:40] rustycans: ?????
[3:01:41] Karkesis: smbg is def worse
[3:01:43] baseboned: no
[3:01:48] bullyybeef: @grumblymike when people didn't interrupt it lol
[3:01:49] a_oshi: shadowmooon being worse than vortex is cooked
[3:01:50] PatrickKaneIsGoat: Vortex sucks ass
[3:01:50] SmellyStrobes: No way is SBG worse than VP what even is this convo
[3:01:50] Homelanderx1: how is azure vault a tier
[3:01:52] Homelanderx1: HUH
[3:01:55] rustycans: these guys are cooking
[3:01:55] goombacci: bricked the whole season for the top .001% yeah
[3:01:57] baseboned: dratnos is wild for hating shadowmoon just for being easy
[3:01:58] MoleDude: vortex worse for sure
[3:01:59] Thor_R: Agree w jb
[3:02:04] Alario1: wasnt SBG the easiest key?
[3:02:06] miraagex: non-MDI VP pulls also sucks hard because trash was fixed. You either choose a drake or a set of stars, no more variablitiy
[3:02:07] reggiepowa: Throne is worse than vortex
[3:02:10] Camelbak21: Bro, SMBG was so chill do to
[3:02:14] segarth: No, SBG was at least doable
[3:02:14] Rahvin331: worm boss in shadowmoon is the most boring boss ever designed
[3:02:22] draconisraccoonis: Dratos hates a key thats easy, vs VP which is just dog shit
[3:02:38] kaleswow: how is AA only in A tier?
[3:02:38] GrimFandango: yeah last season was a real stinket
[3:02:39] goombacci: fall is the redemption arc
[3:02:44] GrimFandango: stinker*
[3:02:44] Darkminst: agreed
[3:02:45] bullyybeef: those dragonflight dungeons for people who solely pug would be massively different 😂
[3:02:50] Alarius_: @Camelbak21 yeah but the pro players are ranking em so we dont get a say lol
[3:02:55] Scoops__: s3s kinda good tho i think
[3:02:57] miraagex: @kaleswow healing high keys was obnoxious
[3:02:58] WingedChipmunk: @Camelbak21 SMBG was bad because it was easy with some poor boss design. It became the key that you do to reroll other keys and just felt awful
[3:03:01] Zircons: dextus Madge
[3:03:10] swerllwow: aug improved some of the dungeons
[3:03:11] SmellyStrobes: The difference between Fall and Rise in terms of fun is so weird
[3:03:20] lucashowmuchpain: aug would have mad halls of valor s Pog
[3:03:21] Camelbak21: @WingedChipmunk I know why.. But I wouldn't say it is worse than VP lul
[3:03:25] PatrickKaneIsGoat: we can also just throw waycrest into F tier and move on as well
[3:03:26] RayWoz: keys wouldve been worse without the god classes
[3:03:30] locokute: aug broken and vortex still f tier shows how f tier this dogshit dungeon is
[3:03:35] goombacci: @PatrickKaneIsGoat hahahaha
[3:03:35] kaleswow: @miraagex I can see that
[3:03:44] Is_Hamm: You can argue MD had the same effect
[3:03:53] Is_Hamm: It was damn near required in some scenarious
[3:04:09] locokute: halls of infusion was unplayable without priest KEKW
[3:04:15] WingedChipmunk: @Camelbak21 idk vortex was rough, SMBG was just bad
[3:04:22] WingedChipmunk: and I LOVED that dungeon prior to S1
[3:04:29] Vikinick: Halls of infusion was fun as hell on priest because MD went BRRRRR
[3:04:46] Stephy_Mariee: i quit the game s2 OpieOP i hadnt quit a season in years lol
[3:05:03] MatrixFlowPro: Fall Is Giga S

[3:05:53] Vikinick: Fall timer is a joke yeah

[3:05:57] metel7: @nekitamocika damnit Dextus
[3:06:03] miraagex: circle room is so bad
[3:06:15] bullyybeef: sand area is terrible, rest is great.
[3:06:15] goombacci: NOWAY I have to look at a huge arrow
[3:06:31] misran: jb just seeing red in fall because it reminds him of dextus
[3:06:32] minglium: B
[3:06:34] Craftthu: that room is bad but everything else is really good
[3:06:49] bullyybeef: last boss is amazing imo
[3:06:52] Stephy_Mariee: 8 minutes DansGame

[3:07:02] Ewebbz: 7 ads???

[3:07:11] kasujkala: everbloom last boss also 7 minutes
[3:07:11] surpriseparty20: Iri dickron YEP
[3:07:14] miraagex: chat What kind of crack did Blizz smoke to design this sand interrupt guy before 1st boss in RISE? It's like the single worst mechanic ever designed?
[3:07:16] Darkminst: Remove
[3:07:17] Thoreya: agreed
[3:07:22] Darkminst: this fucking mega-dungeon
[3:07:50] Darkminst: throw me back into mechagon
[3:07:57] fzybny: Yep, as a dps, this one has been fun.  The only bad boss is the 3rd boss and the handoff
[3:08:06] rustycans: HUH
[3:08:06] RayWoz: the debuffs should just be staggered and fall on there own
[3:08:13] segarth: Worst megadungeon ever by far

[3:08:51] Sweepstakes86: streets alone was better
[3:08:52] segarth: let me take 1 whole minute to open this stargate so you can go to the next platform that has another stargate
[3:08:54] segarth: Dawn is dogshit
[3:08:58] rustycans: Whats good about azure vault lmao
[3:08:59] goombacci: bosses are fun and allow you to dps
[3:09:06] larkhill: as a dps, max is on his own here

[3:11:30] hearthjacks: I would place all of this season's dungeons in either B or C.
[3:11:31] lucashowmuchpain: rise felt good the higher key i went
[3:11:36] bullyybeef: gauntlets shouldn't be in m+
[3:11:36] Sohen: no time saves either
[3:11:36] Stephy_Mariee: its a waste of time that doesnt belong in m+ lol
[3:11:37] Lif3l3ss: the sand gauntlet is the most annoying thing
[3:11:39] fzybny: Easy F, no pull in this dungeon is fun.
[3:11:41] Cabs_Gaming: no wait, the gauntlet followed by the sand area makes it an F

[3:11:43] Sohen: long travel times and RP
[3:11:46] Sohen: just horrible all around
[3:11:46] Morayeden: Not a fan
[3:11:49] Lif3l3ss: hate it
[3:11:49] fallb4me: they need to bring back Temple of Sethraliss that shit was fun af
[3:11:50] baseboned: its cringe
[3:11:51] Durenas: if you keep messing up it's frustrating
[3:11:52] Karkesis: it's not hard but on principle it shouldn't be in the m+ version
[3:11:53] CoffeeASAP: It is really weird
[3:11:57] 4301gway: my fav dungeons are rise and BRH
[3:11:58] Pado99: people only hate the gauntlet if they are bad at it kekw
[3:11:58] Stephy_Mariee: it should be slowed like the balls in temple of sethraliss
[3:12:02] magnusz: ive never not clicked the portal to get thru to the other side
[3:12:03] doucettt: I dont mind it
[3:12:03] atamdev: It shouldn't be in a M+ dungeon
[3:12:06] goombacci: bfa snek place did it better
[3:12:06] CoffeeASAP: it feels more like a gw2 thing than a wow thing
[3:12:07] tommylili14: they should make it a mini game
[3:12:15] rustycans: F
[3:12:24] 1_7_4: @CoffeeASAP this
[3:12:28] fzybny: Also 6 minutes of RP
[3:12:28] atamdev: if it were a world quest, i would love it

[3:12:45] sellenia94: F because of Chromie
[3:12:45] rustycans: it's so cool if you only play Meta tank Pog
[3:12:46] atamdev: but i aint about to do a WQ in the middle of a dungeon
[3:12:49] Thor_R: F
[3:12:53] talync_: sand area is irredirredeemable
[3:12:53] kullkhan: NO shot Rise aint an F there is like 2 mins of solid RP you cannot skip alone if not more
[3:12:56] oresties: I'd rather do Iridikron over Deios though.
[3:13:04] miraagex: Rise should be F tier simply because of the sand kick mechanic prior to the first boss. Delete it and never do anything like that
[3:13:05] kullkhan: F
[3:13:07] Kayjin1223: D
[3:13:09] fzybny: No dungeon with 6 minutes of unskippable RP should be higher than D
[3:13:10] kullkhan: Wrost dungeon ever
[3:13:16] RakknorR: flappy bird minigame in a dungeon when?
[3:13:16] Craftthu: But it's good, except for a few overturning problems and a LOT of RP
[3:13:20] nekitamocika: HoI >>> Rise
[3:13:21] Durenas: the faction war boss is a mess

[3:13:48] atamdev: its a D tier dungeon. the bosses suck and its so front loaded on trash
[3:13:49] nightst314: it is the slowest dungeon
[3:13:51] miraagex: @goombacci 1 person loses few GCDs of damage instead of 0 gcds. it's bad
[3:13:51] Kayjin1223: @goombacci It's an awful mechanic.
[3:13:51] 4nn4n45: signet brand enjoyers
[3:13:52] Frawtarius: Rise is Z tier
[3:13:58] kullkhan: WE RIOT IF NOT F MADGE TERRIBLE DUNGEON
[3:14:01] 1_7_4: based
[3:14:02] andrellius: i like the gauntlet, it gives me a moment of calm and relaxation, remembering that im having fun with friends and its not very bad if we dont time it
[3:14:17] RayWoz: the fact they dismount you is so dumb
[3:14:25] Ditysalad: portal that despawn summons should not be a thing

[3:14:32] Flying5hitz: why does that dragon RP dismounts u? that shit makes no sense
[3:14:33] Wincrediboy: The two empty platforms that you have to travel through multiple times are the worst part
[3:14:34] Pado99: FACTS! dung map is awful
[3:14:36] nekitamocika: 1st boss cringe RP + shield, Morchie perma down time, Gromash adds kill your ass, last boss is boring
[3:14:39] MoleDude: this is so true, people dont even know how to run back
[3:14:41] larkhill: those dragons give me time to take a sip of my drink mid-dungeon
[3:14:41] lumaday: that map is an atrocity
[3:14:44] fzybny: JB with the facts
[3:14:45] atamdev: yep its actually useless

[3:14:59] Sohen: hard F super F call me denzel crocker
[3:15:02] Durenas: YUP, and it's not intuitive where you're supposed to go, there are so many ways to provide helpful map hints and they just didn't
[3:15:03] Kayjin1223: There are like 2 full minutes of unskippable travel time on top of the crazy long RP.
[3:15:11] baseboned: bad
[3:15:13] andaroo: i hate sand...
[3:15:15] ClickyClaxton: LORE
[3:15:15] nanerpus_: fuck morchie as well

[3:15:18] Cryptooman: S  MEANS  super hard or super chill ?  :D
[3:15:18] nekitamocika: Everything is bad here, how is it not F
[3:15:19] Karkesis: it's impressive
[3:15:19] peinen: rise = the maw levels of bad
[3:15:26] Thor_R: Yeah bad
[3:15:26] miraagex: @nekitamocika also first boss was KILLING the people hard until the very recent nerfs
[3:15:26] Durenas: the sand keeps getting in my boots
[3:15:27] Scoops__: LOL
[3:15:28] Larocca_88: dorki KEKW
[3:15:29] SligoYanks: minibosses on tier 1 suck, sand room sucks, battlefield boss is an embarrassment, morchie is irritating, deios is fine

[3:16:09] ChefTinyT: D imo
[3:16:21] GrimFandango: @Speedwow because they never pug with low level players - a coordinated group obliterated that dungeon
[3:16:22] SligoYanks: 3 of the four bosses completely suck, how is it anything other than f
[3:16:23] peinen: @Pado99 sorry I wasn't clear, I meant The Maw the zone in SL
[3:16:23] velle014: Too much RP, u dont have real sense of how much time u have left to know if u need to rush or its over
[3:16:24] nekitamocika: How is Rise same tier as Fall ??
[3:16:25] Ferendel: Worse than Nelth's Lair better than Jade Serpent

[3:17:06] larkhill: id rather be in temple
[3:17:06] kullkhan: F 100%
[3:17:06] Thatguy8795: Temple is more fun than Rise

[3:17:59] fzybny: B, I thought I'd hate it, but now it's like it's not bad.
[3:18:04] miraagex: I hate RBH because I play ranged and it's melee meta, so all ranged shit is baited on me and me alone, but I want to stand and cast and dont move
[3:18:04] minglium: A for tyrran, C for fort

[3:27:10] GrimFandango: HUH
[3:27:11] Shurafna: aintnoway
[3:27:12] goombacci: camera sucks but the actual gameplay is fine
[3:27:12] nekitamocika: 1st boss is so dumb
[3:27:15] Karkesis: the things this dungeon does to your camera should be a federal crime
[3:27:16] pootsxd: waycrest because the corriders fuck the camera
[3:27:17] richie918: it was better in bfa
[3:27:18] sethron: low ceilings, awful camera, dumb bosses
[3:27:18] nathkin: first boss is ass
[3:27:24] yeti_91: cool setting poop camera ruins it

[3:27:32] Morayeden: You nver go right side of house
[3:27:33] tobbs94: F way to narrow
[3:27:36] bullyybeef: the camera angle though
[3:27:41] xPyaro: f if you are a tauren
[3:27:46] Morayeden: Rng witches
[3:27:46] Kerelinn7: waycrest is peak m+, like it sucks ass, but the m+ format makes it so fun
[3:27:47] tobbs94: nvm D
[3:27:49] misran: looking at chat i think waycrest is S tier for most polarizing dungeon
[3:27:49] bullyybeef: great dungeon though
[3:27:50] m_dep: low A ez
[3:27:54] m_dep: EZ low A
[3:27:54] Kayjin1223: Easy A
[3:27:55] MBG_95: first boss is also ass for kicks, MC mechanics are terrible. goliath sucks, all of the witches are ass, SO many mobs cannot be silenced too
[3:27:56] ohfoeshow: A
[3:28:01] Cherparrots: Boomkin gets mentioned every dungeon monkaHmm
[3:28:05] andaroo: I love Waycrest - A or S
[3:28:05] fallb4me: I hate the fat boss
[3:28:10] guynormally: B
[3:28:10] MBG_95: its a C
[3:28:12] goombacci: @Morayeden routes are optimized NOWAY
[3:28:12] drumminbacon: i’d call it b+
[3:28:16] ohfoeshow: low A
[3:28:16] CoffeeASAP: The witch laughs make it at least A tier YEP
[3:28:18] miraagex: First boss trio in WM can go suck each other asses
[3:28:20] atamdev: I do really wish they had just given us the BFA verson with all doors open
[3:28:24] goombacci: doors are open btw. it is not worse
[3:28:26] Madgeneto: @fallb4me fat phobic, get canceled
[3:28:32] Whitewolf1441: love the guests for this
[3:28:35] bullyybeef: it's a huge dub but I've only ever gone one way still
[3:28:45] Zircons: right side Sadge
[3:28:52] Morayeden: @Morayeden Yeah, no, its not about optimized routes. You just do not go left side in BRH. Same with WM. It's just infinitely worst.
[3:29:27] Camelbak21: SANGUINE
[3:29:31] Camelbak21: SANGUINE AAAA
[3:29:44] Rahvin331: necrotic was a nightmare there
[3:29:47] m_dep: @Maximum you dont play a ranger player lol
[3:29:51] Ahrmanhamma: Busting and Bolstering still affect the dogs in Waycrest, which is a travesty
[3:29:53] Its_Big_Tone: ITS SO BAD I DISAGREE LOL
[3:29:55] sethron: melee bias showing
[3:30:02] MoleDude: melee take
[3:30:02] ArcticFortune: xd. downstairs with storming and a ret pala doing is disco shit
[3:30:03] pedrodaboch4: cap
[3:30:04] baseboned: maybe dont tell me what I can care about
[3:30:06] bullyybeef: it's not unimportant come on
[3:30:06] winchester__x: mellee brain
[3:30:07] yeti_91: does matter for sure lol
[3:30:07] draconisraccoonis: says the DH that just jumps like a degen anyway
[3:30:08] Kerelinn7: storming pulling mobs sucks
[3:30:09] soupdog55: melee take
[3:30:09] zNzUV: dude i always think of the camera ALWAYS
[3:30:09] baseboned: the camera is annoying
[3:30:10] Madgeneto: it's got nothing to do with how nerfed the affixes are
[3:30:10] pedrodaboch4: camera is horrible
[3:30:11] hearthjacks: it feels bad if you have to target the ground
[3:30:15] miraagex: sanguine in Uldaman? :)
[3:30:16] Karkesis: visuals in a dungeon are a massively important thing to me tbh, if the camera sucks or there's too much clutter like in Freehold it's like -2 tiers instantly
[3:30:19] goombacci: people cant have different opinions NOTED
[3:30:19] st0rmbreed: @Maximum lets get the boys together and push for a S2 SoD World #1
[3:30:19] ProjectIrene: who needs to see their characters and the enemies anyway?
[3:30:19] MoleDude: that's because the hallways are bad
[3:30:21] m_dep: @Maximum melee goes brrrrr
[3:30:22] kingpeace09: range camera sucks
[3:30:22] ohfoeshow: TD
[3:30:22] dango0n: PUGS dont do that hough
[3:30:22] rekr3: It does ruin it for me, I can't play the hallways without a bucket
[3:30:23] fallb4me: Tol Dagor Aware
[3:30:27] Speedwow: wait til they find out you can zoom in your camera so it's not a problem
[3:30:33] pootsxd: melee take
[3:30:43] draconisraccoonis: rare Max L take on a dungeon right there
[3:30:47] dango0n: this dungeon is as for someone that exclusively PUGS
[3:30:48] CKBandit: Best atmosphere should give a few points
[3:30:50] ohfoeshow: sanguine depths
[3:30:52] dango0n: ass*
[3:30:54] malavander: at least there aren't trees in the way, its claustrophobic but feels like an actual spooky house
[3:31:02] m_dep: @Speedwow kinda fucks up being able to do casting, you really need to be zoomed out
[3:31:07] sgtmuffi: sanguine makes this shit too
[3:31:14] nightst314: TD is the worst indoor dungeon
[3:31:14] bullyybeef: even with the camera it's a great dungeon though
[3:31:24] dango0n: I seek out FALL for staff lol
[3:31:24] goombacci: it also provided us with 3 days of the nonverbal meme
[3:31:33] Rahvin331: A
[3:31:34] Madgeneto: ez A
[3:31:35] MBG_95: C

[3:31:40] jacobtheultimate: middle of A
[3:31:43] nekitamocika: B at best
[3:31:47] Is_Hamm: growl lowkey disagreeing in silence
[3:31:49] liiiqq: dungeon goated
[3:32:04] Morayeden: Atal is B
[3:32:07] atamdev: AD is great, actual route options
[3:32:10] andaroo: Atal is A or B
[3:32:12] nekitamocika: AD is mid
[3:32:12] ohfoeshow: B
[3:32:13] Rahvin331: S
[3:32:15] Scoops__: oooo idk
[3:32:16] sgtmuffi: B
[3:32:18] goombacci: straight to S, didnt ask
[3:32:20] Scoops__: i think its a B
[3:32:20] sgtmuffi: last boss is ass
[3:32:21] Bark3r: S
[3:32:22] Thor_R: A
[3:32:22] poroyou: aint no way azure vaults sitting next to acadmey
[3:32:23] Fufah: B, its b oring
[3:32:23] ProjectIrene: S for me XD
[3:32:24] Ahrmanhamma: Mid-A
[3:32:25] ripsaltytv: I really feel like half the BFA dungeons blizzard had a shit ton of fun making, and the other half they said fuck the players
[3:32:25] guynormally: ask Firedup xdd
[3:32:26] miraagex: I hate Atal because my pugs NEVER soak blood on that lady boss.
[3:32:27] Xibate: easy A
[3:32:33] Faraday5001: yazma ruins it
[3:32:34] nightst314: endboss
[3:32:35] Hag3lund: B
[3:32:37] PleaseLessen: lost a tier after the last boss change
[3:32:37] Fufah: easy B
[3:32:42] goombacci: yes the optimal route is optimized, crazy
[3:32:43] Madgeneto: A
[3:32:45] ShinehornLukita: AD is big play, so many options on how to play it
[3:32:46] dango0n: agree
[3:32:46] fzybny: Probably an A, not an S because of Yazma not scaling.
[3:32:49] miraagex: @Faraday5001 ??? the only skillcheck in the whole dungeon
[3:32:50] xforeignerr: shadowlands m+ atleast A tier
[3:32:50] Rahvin331: lots of routing options
[3:32:53] atamdev: I hate that they made it so you cant interrupt the last boss though
[3:32:54] guynormally: KEKW
[3:32:54] Lif3l3ss: I hate the right side but left side has too many kicks for most pugs under 25s
[3:32:55] Darkminst: going right is a standered in pugging
[3:32:55] Scoops__: how well spoken dorki
[3:32:56] hearthjacks: juggernauts are tragic
[3:33:00] Kayjin1223: New and exciting boss memes
[3:33:02] OspreyRed: pugs like going right
[3:33:08] Faraday5001: @Faraday5001 it isnt fun in anyway on high keys
[3:33:09] brosciencegym: toadphPog
[3:33:17] CoffeeASAP: Firedup drank 40 monsters and did atal it was great
[3:33:21] chasen218: juggernauts FFFFFFFFFF
[3:33:22] lifeissadx: going right is straight up terrorism
[3:33:28] minglium: yazma and juggernauts are miserable
[3:33:30] miraagex: @Faraday5001 adds spawn damage should be nerfed by like 90%, so dot overlap doesnt feel as bad
[3:33:33] rekr3: @OspreyRed going left is death with a pug, nobody interrupts
[3:33:43] minglium: B
[3:33:45] sgtmuffi: DH chains do the same :3
[3:33:54] TBouse: nothing murders you except fucking up the juggernauts
[3:34:00] miraagex: @OspreyRed i have never ever seen anyone going right side. what keys are you doing?
[3:34:27] DigoCapiroto: going left with pugs where people overlap kicks and don't know how to bait juggers is suicide
[3:34:32] meraxesc: is it difficulty tierlist or enjot?
[3:34:36] atamdev: Incorrect
[3:34:36] meraxesc: enjoy*
[3:34:44] guynormally: enjoy
[3:34:47] luigiisama: it's not about the damage it's about the movement imo
[3:34:48] dango0n: Little wigs tells me to interrupt and I cant! bull shit lol
[3:34:50] Morayeden: Rezan, priestess, and Volkaal are bad bosses
[3:34:54] lifeissadx: wait azure vault A tier????????????Xd
[3:34:57] Nephs: I feel like that fight just lasts too long tbh
[3:35:00] Rahvin331: the cast goes off then immediately you are killed by the soul stack mechanic
[3:35:03] Vikinick: looking at you everbloom
[3:35:22] Bearbut: Bearbut subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 24 months! 
[3:35:22] meraxesc: why sbg is f tier
[3:35:24] chasen218: B
[3:35:26] planooooooooooooooooooooo: god vortex pinnacle just needs its own dogshit tier
[3:35:31] ohfoeshow: low B
[3:35:34] miraagex: AD is absolute nightmare in 20-22 pugs. People still cant kill totems correctly. People still soak all bloods properly. People still dont position themselves properly
[3:35:36] ohfoeshow: maybe C
[3:35:37] ShinehornLukita: S tier on BFA / B tier now
[3:35:49] MBG_95: B
[3:35:50] fzybny: Feels like low A
[3:35:53] Morayeden: B

[3:36:02] Vikinick: I like the layout
[3:36:04] atamdev: its a/B
[3:36:06] Rahvin331: The route variation is fantastic
[3:36:08] dango0n: here comes another F
[3:36:14] goombacci: lol
[3:36:19] friendshrimp: growl non verbal disagreeing
[3:36:21] Scoops__: motherlode needs to be brought back
[3:36:24] dango0n: Throne of the tides is Swampass
[3:36:24] Morayeden: D
[3:36:24] weezie_61: Juggernauts murder everyone if you dont have bait totem... it is bad
[3:36:25] WARM_s6: I am so surprised that Motherlode hasn't come back
[3:36:27] atamdev: man the BFA dungeons were so good

[3:36:32] APieceOfLego: b-d
[3:36:34] Karkesis: B
[3:36:34] baseboned: why is living in atal and freehold good but living in shadowmoon bad?
[3:36:35] JackOfAllApocalypses: that was a fuckin mad scientist laugh
[3:36:35] oresties: the last hall of trash in throne can go fuck itself
[3:36:35] Bark3r: A
[3:36:37] ohfoeshow: D
[3:36:37] guynormally: nyehehehehe CATW
[3:36:37] jacobtheultimate: tott is dogwater
[3:36:38] Thor_R: D
[3:36:38] richie918: get a Z tier for this garbage
[3:36:38] rekr3: atal is A for me just because it's outdoors
[3:36:41] mutelibmb: F
[3:36:43] Madgeneto: D
[3:36:44] booznoon: its kinda whatever

[3:36:58] TBouse: worst bosses of this season
[3:37:02] Celestial990: It's hard but good B for me YEP
[3:37:03] xforeignerr: throne of tides is same as vortex tbh, but easier i think
[3:37:14] fzybny: Probably the highest D
[3:37:22] chasen218: dot
[3:37:22] goombacci: if...
[3:37:23] ohfoeshow: healing the MC boss lol
[3:37:25] CoffeeASAP: I like the 2nd bosses smooth, silky voice
[3:37:34] WingedChipmunk: @riotscream FH is shit boss designs, WAYYY too RNG heavy and just feels bad
[3:37:38] ubi_hs: omg this ads every 10 min
[3:37:44] frazlord: No Mechagon?
[3:37:49] luxumbra69: omotherlode rixxa absolutely terrified me in pugs. pug healers so sadge.
[3:37:51] censiGFY: Both cataclysm dungeons deserve to be in super low F tier. No routing possible. Just overtune mecanics. Shit feeling. Nothing good about them
[3:37:51] goombacci: @frazlord ?
[3:37:58] DigoCapiroto: tott with vdh - b, without - c
[3:38:04] chief_wiecke: intermission is dogshit. smallies spawing first is just annoying af
[3:38:06] miraagex: @riotscream they rated BFA FH as S, DF FH as A
[3:38:18] Hag3lund: TOtt is a D or F for me
[3:38:32] minglium: absolutely
[3:39:05] ohfoeshow: sanguine + sentries + debuffs + aquamages LOL
[3:39:12] Celestial990: Compared to the other oldest dungeons from other seasons - temple and vortex, throne is 1000x better

[3:39:36] Xyletics: in pugs, in gauntlet
[3:39:40] Hag3lund: I hate the first boss
[3:39:42] guynormally: throne is fun ya nerds
[3:39:42] alexchopstix: pugs struggle SO bad on the last boss for some reason
[3:39:43] PeJeyTV: @uncontrollable_bladder o7
[3:39:46] ohfoeshow: the dogs chase u down and drop sanguine LOL so theres sanguine everywhere and everyones dying
[3:39:46] alexchopstix: esp on low keys
[3:39:49] bullyybeef: sorry, low key pug players
[3:39:53] devz_5: devz_5 subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 9 months! 
[3:39:53] pootsxd: why mine not that long?
[3:39:58] tobbs94: sounds like a casual take
[3:40:02] alexchopstix: on low keys people struggle hard
[3:40:05] CoffeeASAP: pugs struggle with the puddles
[3:40:07] Wafzig: If all you're doing is pugging for Vault, you LOVE Shadowmoon and HATE Throne.
[3:40:09] alexchopstix: blows my mind
[3:40:12] Cryptooman: Last boss is the easiest boss evr
[3:40:12] ShinehornLukita: the majority of players are pugging, and on pugs this dungeon is big F
[3:40:13] edolann: last boss in pugs tank runs out of place to stand
[3:40:14] miraagex: last boss as 5 melee group is stinky
[3:40:14] chanpa: basically only pug and I feel like tott is kind of nice
[3:40:15] Clandestin: the heal absorb
[3:40:20] Scoops__: no hes right pugs do not clear
[3:40:20] thasthebear: sooooo many times
[3:40:20] Slagggy: yeah I fuck that shit up every day

[3:40:25] weezie_61: C
[3:40:26] Thatguy8795: last boss was a lot worse at the start of the season @Maximum, they fixed some stuff
[3:40:32] ohfoeshow: D
[3:40:33] alexchopstix: seriously the whole dungeon will go fine and then wipe CONSTANTLY on the last boss its fucking mindblowing
[3:40:33] miraagex: C or D tier
[3:40:34] Zaldarie: It's an okay dungeon, but every affix that is already bad feels extra special bad in this dungeon. Bolstering and Sanguine are horrendous.
[3:40:34] zNzUV: D
[3:40:39] draconisraccoonis: its almost like there is a skill gap between a top world first player and joe doing vault keys?
[3:40:40] bigmeanbeefy: Yes max, but you do pugs in 20++, do it in a 10 and see how that is in the start of the season, people are clueless :P
[3:40:43] larkhill: max depletes keys way before it ever gets to last boss
[3:40:45] ShinehornLukita: if you don't play on a team = wipe
[3:40:46] LennyD52: C - period
[3:40:51] draconisraccoonis: this dungeon is a B at the worst tho

[3:42:11] LennyD52: yeah its average
[3:42:15] goombacci: @oresties they would need to add a lot of mechs
[3:42:18] logicaltty: i could slam a Hi-C right now
[3:42:19] bigmeanbeefy: @miraagex again, try and gear up a new char in a season and you will see just how many clueless and arrogant people there are, especially dps player, sadly
[3:42:28] cloudberrylive: wait why is underrot S, isnt is just ass pull galore and horrible aesthetic

[3:43:06] draconisraccoonis: Everbloom A

[3:43:07] thasthebear: big numbers better dungeon
[3:43:07] atamdev: EB is good

[3:43:15] larkhill: melee falls asleep on first boss
[3:43:16] minglium: C
[3:43:16] DigoCapiroto: everbloom is a banger, but way too overtuned
[3:43:17] logicaltty: it's fine, B for me
[3:43:17] pedrodaboch4: the bosses do to much dmg
[3:43:18] Camelbak21: God damn spinners man
[3:43:18] fzybny: Yeah, I like Everbloom, B, but I wouldn't argue if someone has it as an A
[3:43:20] ohfoeshow: but its a B due to sanguine/bolstering
[3:43:22] Camelbak21: ranged nightmare
[3:43:22] Faraday5001: fuck affixs on flowers, fuck last boss
[3:43:23] Hag3lund: 3 boss is a bit of a cock but its a A for me
[3:43:26] redsmith12: b
[3:43:26] misran: EB is a good example of a dungeon where you can cook up a lot of different routes
[3:43:32] Feverdreams_0_: target capped spec, this dungeon is ass
[3:43:41] chasen218: 3d as a hunter? FFFFF
[3:43:43] R3w4s: I hate 3rd boss the random cast that dies 99% of ur hp on 27+ and a dot on top ... Every oneshot ability that's a random target w/o an indication has to fkn go
[3:43:44] nekitamocika: playing with VDH is kinda chill, without can be painful
[3:43:51] Kayjin1223: Fuck the small flowers having affixes
[3:43:52] tobbs94: if 2nd boss wasent awful id put it in A
[3:44:01] chasen218: 3d boss as a hunter??? FFFF DD
[3:44:05] Stephy_Mariee: everbloom every boss you do gets worse lmao
[3:44:10] ohfoeshow: small flower ondeath affixes drop this place a full letter grade
[3:44:10] Zaldarie: Everbloom is super fun and challenging to heal as well, with a good group in this dungeon I have more fun than anywhere else.
[3:44:13] sgtmuffi: VDH and prot pal makes it nice
[3:44:19] chief_wiecke: the double abo first pull attempt in the 30 was my favourite route
[3:44:23] rulzzs: Last boss on high tyra keys lasts 5min..that makes me hate the dungeon so much
[3:44:23] fzybny: 3rd boss feels bad with a mid to bad healer.
[3:44:27] freddergangster: @Kayjin1223 yeah downgrade it one level
[3:44:36] razortanktv: this is COOKED. BRH in C tier HoI above SBG? HUH?
[3:44:38] sgtmuffi: the bosses suck ass though
[3:44:39] lifeissadx: EVERBLOOM F TIER OR IM GONNA KILL MYSELF
[3:44:39] ohfoeshow: 7x bolstered fortified aboms
[3:44:44] bigmeanbeefy: @miraagex Well, then i agree to disagree
[3:44:46] Maximum: @lifeissadx RIPBOZO
[3:44:52] swerllwow: last boss is too long
[3:44:53] CoffeeASAP: lol
[3:44:55] ninemoreminutes: Everbloom is S tier
[3:44:59] MBG_95: its a Fort boss that goes to 6minutes on a 29...
[3:45:04] lifeissadx: @lifeissadx i will do it anyway tho
[3:45:07] alexchopstix: @razortanktv gotta remember these guys are talking about 28+ not 20's
[3:45:09] nekitamocika: DonoWall
[3:45:15] miraagex: m+ for trash, raids for bosses YEP
[3:45:17] alexchopstix: so its alot different than what alot of people in this chat are doing
[3:45:21] caveman2x: wait how is nokhud not D ?
[3:45:39] ohfoeshow: its because the dungeon is like 80% flowers rofl
[3:45:46] TheHermitt: TheHermitt subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 6 months! 
[3:45:52] JackOfAllApocalypses: oh no...a non-affix
[3:45:53] IAmSolari: Honestly sitting and commentating on growls raid souns like content
[3:45:54] sUb2_w9nDeR: "3rd boss everbloom is shit with a bad healer" is the mose absolute screen off, 0 defensive dps take ive ever seen in my life
[3:45:55] JackOfAllApocalypses: the horror...
[3:45:57] chasen218: 3d boss is FF max... dont u dare to put it above
[3:46:17] velle014: I have love - hate relationship with this dung. I love it till u re at 3rd/4th boss and realise u re gonna deplete it by like 10s, or u just straight out full wipe at one of them after 30 mins.
[3:46:24] ohfoeshow: it definitely shows the difference between old dungeon design and modern affixes..they dont always mesh
[3:46:24] swerllwow: remove all the affixes
[3:46:30] chasen218: yo max ... from a hunter here... 3d boss is FFF DD
[3:46:30] freddergangster: maybe its a sign to remove dogshit affixes
[3:46:31] sethret: no too easy
[3:46:33] weezie_61: C
[3:46:37] ohfoeshow: B
[3:46:39] tobbs94: bursting flowers YEP
[3:46:43] ohfoeshow: A if flowers didnt do ondeath
[3:46:50] CoffeeASAP: last boss sucks on tyr but otherwise I like
[3:46:51] Sache_cL: B 󠀀
[3:46:52] Jese_XIII: @chasen218 just get good
[3:46:52] CorrosiveLotion: cooked
[3:46:54] chasen218: @Maximum  do u like in try weeks ?
[3:46:56] JackOfAllApocalypses: honestly I liked it more in WoD
[3:46:58] chasen218: tyr**
[3:46:59] Zaldarie: Gotta take away some points for first and last boss. Long and boring.
[3:46:59] Stephy_Mariee: everbloom my least favorite dungeon this season OpieOP
[3:47:01] FrostmagicED: B; 2nd boss cooks groups
[3:47:02] Raekthechef: Loved it in WoD dont like it in DF, like low C tier for me atm
[3:47:04] JackOfAllApocalypses: I don't dislike it now though
[3:47:05] cloudberrylive: in WOD you just never kicked 3rd boss so she didnt phase which was cool @Maximum
[3:47:10] chasen218: @Jese_XIII coach me
[3:47:11] minglium: i cant see shit. Camera angle is bad
[3:47:14] sevven07: B
[3:47:15] atamdev: Aside from first boss being really boring, its a really good dungeon
[3:47:17] Gromasaurus: As a enhance player I say c
[3:47:23] kelamortal: I'd much pref blizz change affix's to 1 to increase difficulty, and 1 to empower you - how they mix together would make week to week more interesting
[3:47:23] Thasin22: B at the highest
[3:47:24] ohfoeshow: 6min yalnus are fuun
[3:47:28] internetgoon: wtf who likes azure vaults???
[3:47:29] alexchopstix: is there any function on this site that would allow people to vote their tier on these dungeons
[3:47:34] alexchopstix: yeah exactly!!
[3:47:39] Armagaren: damn next time
[3:47:42] jonpelf: ya dps ignoring the add on last boss BabyRage as healer
[3:47:43] Pwndepot1982: this does not deserve to be on AA tier
[3:47:45] GrimFandango: Underrot would have been mega F
[3:47:45] CorrosiveLotion: nah sbg sucks
[3:47:46] Vitel__: SBG was always a free two or three chest
[3:47:46] LionButLeon: Azure I would put D YEP
[3:47:46] Thoreya: A for me
[3:47:48] NattyPally: HoV is so dog shit
[3:47:49] ohfoeshow: SMBG can SMD
[3:47:56] alexchopstix: and im curious about the split in this chat of how high keys people do on average in here
[3:47:56] trentbail23: do it.
[3:48:02] Thoreya: challenging, but fun. just bc it’s challenging doesn’t mean it’s bad
[3:48:03] Thoreya: imo
[3:48:04] baseboned: that's really reductive
[3:48:08] alexchopstix: a pull of what your highest consistent key
[3:48:13] alexchopstix: poll*
[3:48:21] tobbs94: shoulda woulda coulda YEP
[3:48:22] Karkesis: I think it's kinda overstated how easy the civilian crowd wants things to be, even casuals can still be fine being challenged
[3:48:24] m_dep: @Maximum what yumy said but also fun matters, but fun at 20 isnt the same as fun at 28
[3:48:46] trentbail23: im in the 22-23 range as a bear tank
[3:48:47] tylxrwow: a dungeon can be good on 20-25 and also good on 29.
[3:48:55] miraagex: EB 3rd boss tyran DELETES people on pull in high keys
[3:48:57] chasen218: i dont tbh
[3:49:09] kj01a: there's lightning damage in tott??
[3:49:14] chasen218: how does it work ?
[3:49:17] Armagaren: I feel like to rectify this, the way M+ is scored would need to change so people wouldn't worry about ease of doing it or cheese
[3:49:22] Juanzary: 26 ppl still noidea
[3:49:22] miraagex: @kj01a first boss chain lightning
[3:49:23] LionButLeon: meow
[3:49:27] Karkesis: Prayge kill the dragon
[3:49:27] rekr3: I have guildies that can't understand. No matter how much it is explained.
[3:49:28] Sch1ey: I thought it just hit people
[3:49:29] Kayjin1223: As someone at the very bottom of title level, difficulty of the key matters a lot to me. I dread Throne 28 vs BRH 28.
[3:49:39] Zarroe: HOLY
[3:49:42] JackOfAllApocalypses: lol
[3:49:42] Scoops__: max lovewatches while gromnak hatewatches
[3:49:46] planooooooooooooooooooooo: fall's last boss is the same problem as rise's first problem, the shield completely annihilates your damage uptime and makes the boss take FOREVER
[3:49:47] jonpelf: good luck growl!
[3:49:55] Morayeden: S1>S3>S2
[3:49:58] JackOfAllApocalypses: I better go get food now I don't want to miss the commentary on the commentary
[3:50:07] fzybny: S1 > S3 >>>>>> S2
[3:50:08] sgtmuffi: Good dungeons bad affix
[3:50:08] Camelbak21: tuck fhundering
[3:50:10] Karkesis: is this comparing the dungeon pool or the entire experience of the season
[3:50:11] Thor_R: C B A
[3:50:14] d4_damager_: bfa s tier
[3:50:16] RSRonin: I really liked S2 before godcomp
[3:50:19] miraagex: my udk was invited to keys prior to aug release.....
[3:50:28] nekitamocika: S1 >> S3 >>>>>> S2 EZ
[3:50:29] atamdev: S1>S3>>>>S2
[3:50:39] Shurafna: Thundering wasnt that bad
[3:50:42] sgtmuffi: S3>S2=S1
[3:50:43] Dralgy: thundering made season 1 so much worse than it should have been
[3:50:45] planooooooooooooooooooooo: thundering was a giant poopy turd
[3:50:45] avenira_qt: S1 > S3 >>>>>>>>>>>>>  S2
[3:50:47] tobbs94: s1 A s2 D s3 C
[3:50:50] CorrosiveLotion: S3 > S2 > S1
[3:50:51] Raekthechef: s2 pre augvoker > s3/s1
[3:50:55] Fufah: wth? this season is prob the best!
[3:50:59] larkhill: @miraagex wait for mdi. you'll get invites again afterwards
[3:51:01] LionButLeon: S2 ele> s3
[3:51:05] Fufah: S3 -> S2 -> S1
[3:51:08] ArcticFortune: Just split season 2 up into two. its not fair otherwise
[3:51:09] internetgoon: all are close imo pretty good overall
[3:51:11] Karkesis: 1 > 2 > 3 for me
[3:51:18] miraagex: @larkhill but i abandoned it and dont have leggo :(
[3:51:19] ZordiakZero: S3 > S1 > S2
[3:51:20] stuffiexo: can't wait to see shadowlands m+ in S tier
[3:51:28] miraagex: s2 pre-aug > s1/s3 > s2
[3:51:29] tobbs94: if not thundering s1 is S
[3:51:34] Kinzarro: season 2 is D
[3:51:39] chasen218: what was thundering again ?
[3:51:41] TeamLiquid: Looking to take your gameplay to the next level? Learning a new class and would like some pointers? Head on over to our discord go.adv.gg/6tAoHx to schedule a coaching session with your favorite Team Liquid raider!
[3:51:58] Morayeden: S1>S3>D4>S2
[3:52:15] chief_wiecke: the speed shroud was so nice
[3:52:19] BobPlaysTheGames: @chasen218 It does 3 hits each time, each initial hit goes on a dps or healer, never the tank, and it can't target the same player twice. The lightning then bounces to the nearest target for half damage, so everyone should spread in a formation around the tank so the nearest ally for everyone is the tank. That way you can't die unless you get one shot.
[3:52:36] miraagex: s2 and s3 have insanely easy gearing which is loved by a lot of players who hate character/gear progression
[3:52:36] minglium: C
[3:52:49] atamdev: S2 is F tier
[3:52:51] pinkbox: pre aug s post aug f
[3:52:53] pinkbox: :)
[3:52:58] brainrot_behavior: @atamdev facts
[3:52:59] Morayeden: F tier S2
[3:52:59] Karkesis: YEP
[3:53:00] fzybny: S2 was F because of god comp
[3:53:00] Rahvin331: Thundering was so bad they killed seasonal affixes
[3:53:05] dango0n: MoP was balanced
[3:53:07] miraagex: pre-aug best times (i play arcane and udk)
[3:53:10] eyxx: the world would be a better place without the horror of augmentation
[3:53:11] Emm_Zee: 10.1.5 tanks this season to the worst of all time tbh
[3:53:13] GrimFandango: @Maximum split S2 into 2 different choices
[3:53:14] minglium: augy
[3:53:17] chief_wiecke: aug Madge
[3:53:19] Kinzarro: D or F if you didnt play god comp
[3:53:20] m_dep: but most of the people playing is before .5
[3:53:23] chasen218: bring back MOP
[3:53:24] seijurotr: s2 is F
[3:53:26] CoffeeASAP: I skipped season 2, A tier EZ
[3:53:27] nekitamocika: Just put it in D
[3:53:29] Varae__: that first month was a banger
[3:53:32] cxzzzzxc: بولحيه
[3:53:34] richie918: still better than s3
[3:53:40] m_dep: first half matters more, most people stopped after mid season
[3:53:50] Camelbak21: Make better affixes, seasonal is just rose tinted glasses cause all the other affixes made the seasons worse
[3:54:03] ohfoeshow: its not just godcomp..its s2godcomp >>>>> all other godcomps
[3:54:25] sgtmuffi: uldman alone ruined s2 for me
[3:54:31] Alarius_: god comp basically ruined that entire season for so many other classes
[3:54:39] Alarius_: before and after
[3:54:42] miraagex: @Alarius_ for all classes except godcomp :
[3:54:45] miraagex: :D
[3:54:45] brainrot_behavior: yeah I didn't want to step in 4/8 dungeons in s2
[3:54:50] chasen218: Temple,vortex,NL,neltharus ????? GGG SHIT
[3:54:51] d4_damager_: mages ruining s3 just as much
[3:55:02] miraagex: @d4_damager_ ????
[3:55:09] Armagaren: I feel like the dungeons themselves overall were very fun in season 2 compared to the other seasons
[3:55:09] miraagex: we're not
[3:55:13] GrimFandango: @d4_damager_ lmao, what
[3:55:22] Kayjin1223: S2 is D for me at best. Even before God Comp I didn't love the dungeon pool. And then God Comp made me quit the season.
[3:55:23] nekitamocika: No way Dorki that is Bear main liked S2 KEKW
[3:55:28] texas_grizzly: I play aug and love aug. I've never been able to climb M+ like I am now.
[3:55:34] chasen218: FFFFFFFFFFFFF
[3:55:36] SlowboLaggins: it was hell trying to get groups as a fury warrior in s2
[3:55:36] pootsxd: what was s2 god comp?
[3:55:41] coupernicous: F
[3:55:41] zzzDai: F
[3:55:45] Morayeden: F
[3:55:45] ArcticFortune: F
[3:55:53] miraagex: A+ pre-aug, F post-aug
[3:55:55] jonpelf: god comp was damn fun tho, i got 3k for first time with both hpal and aug
[3:56:03] sw0ngs: yea if you played warr/dk, it was complete dogshit for s2
[3:56:05] bullyybeef: getting into groups was abysmal
[3:56:11] Lemussi: b4 AUG: S or A // After Aug: F----
[3:56:12] chasen218: spriest/mage/aug
[3:56:12] moldozer: SWAMP!!!
[3:56:13] fzybny: F horrible dungeons, horrible class balance, don't get how much worse this can get.
[3:56:16] freddergangster: cant you just split season 2?
[3:56:19] Bwelder87: aug only came out in 10.1.5 tho. I feel start of the s2 was pretty good
[3:56:24] Cocotao: @pootsxd Guardian druid / Fire mage / Spriest/ Aug / Hpal
[3:56:29] grimzero617: Yeah but there's not many people that get title period
[3:56:29] Team_Spanky: A wild night out for an Augmentation Main is Two Appetizers and a Margarita with no salt at an Applebee's
[3:56:39] d4_damager_: @bullyybeef its the same in s3, cant get in a group being a lock
[3:56:58] Team_Spanky: Augmentation Evoker Mains think black pepper makes things too spicy.
[3:57:13] Kayjin1223: What? Demo is very good right now.
[3:57:24] atamdev: S2 was just a mess all around
[3:57:24] m_dep: Turbo F?
[3:57:27] Morayeden: Adding a entire new role mid season
[3:57:30] Maximum: @bullyybeef thats crazy demo fucking owns
[3:57:33] Team_Spanky: Augmentation Evoker Mains, only do it in missionary and they keep a t-shirt and socks on.
[3:57:34] nekitamocika: its D
[3:57:34] d4_damager_: demo is very good, but i still cant get 26 invite with nearly 3.4k
[3:57:35] LionButLeon: fr tho
[3:57:51] ohfoeshow: introducing a new role in the middle of a season seems like a dumb decision
[3:57:56] Emm_Zee: Like if godcomp season is not F, what is?
[3:57:59] bullyybeef: im not a lock lol during god comp as a warrior I meant.
[3:58:04] m_dep: @Maximum demo is boring :(
[3:58:10] bullyybeef: the other guy said it not me
[3:58:19] miraagex: @d4_damager_ do you understand that at certain key level only a handful of specs is viable in m+?
[3:58:30] freddergangster: split it
[3:58:33] Readyforbagels: make a rating for god comp and another for non god
[3:58:34] nekitamocika: put it in D
[3:58:38] tobbs94: ez job YEP
[3:58:42] m_dep: yeah thats fair
[3:58:46] d4_damager_: @d4_damager_ lock is entierly viable up until 28 for pugs
[3:58:48] Stephy_Mariee: the first time i quit keys in years :)
[3:58:51] Morayeden: S3 bfa
[3:58:52] Keppie__: Beguiling
[3:58:53] pedrodaboch4: D
[3:58:55] Kayjin1223: @Maximum Rank 10.1 and 10.1.5 separately?
[3:59:00] alexchopstix: I'm making live event for Chat to vote our opinions cause i'm curious how different it is
[3:59:06] grimzero617: If you were god comp, you still had to play VP, so it's F
[3:59:09] Rahvin331: Prideful was the worst
[3:59:10] pinkbox: we civs accept D
[3:59:20] Sch1ey: Like ghunnies...
[3:59:28] Minirawr: Prideful was swampass tier
[3:59:34] guynormally: back in JB's day BBoomer
[3:59:36] alexchopstix: ***
[3:59:38] alexchopstix: chat go vote
[3:59:38] Nephs: g'huunies was the worst by far imo
[3:59:40] ArcticFortune: ghunies in waycrest xd
[3:59:52] CoffeeASAP: more blood for the blood god
[3:59:58] miraagex: HUH
[4:00:01] nekitamocika: HUH
[4:00:03] Plaza_: firstGarf
[4:00:03] just_one_sock: Ew, underrot. I hate underrot. It's so.... Wet
[4:00:03] rukt: HUH  󠀀
[4:00:04] xJorbash: HUH
[4:00:04] smashwow: ya gooned
[4:00:05] shankubro: BFA corrupted season better than all other seasons
[4:00:05] Nephs: HUH
[4:00:07] sir_boo_alot: HUH
[4:00:08] pr0ne: HUH
[4:00:08] Morayeden: S3 B
[4:00:08] BigTrout3: firstGarf HOLY
[4:00:09] mutelibmb: A
[4:00:12] Karkesis: B
[4:00:12] nekitamocika: C\
[4:00:12] chasen218: A
[4:00:12] 1_7_4: A or B
[4:00:13] Arktos99: firstGarf
[4:00:14] MVPBuster: its like solid B maybe lower A
[4:00:16] LionButLeon: C
[4:00:16] ohfoeshow: A
[4:00:16] cloudberrylive: A tier
[4:00:17] Ferendel: firstGarf
[4:00:17] guynormally: yo I have chat filter on that firstGarf made no sense to me
[4:00:17] Kerelinn7: A tier
[4:00:17] PleaseLessen: b 󠀀
[4:00:19] grimzero617: Git ghuun'd bud
[4:00:20] mutelibmb: AA
[4:00:22] nuka73: season reaping was thes best
[4:00:22] cloudberrylive: A
[4:00:23] Nephs: A I think
[4:00:23] Mattefofan: A
[4:00:24] sgtmuffi: A
[4:00:26] ArcticFortune: B (bad dungeons but good tuning)
[4:00:28] nekitamocika: S1 > S3
[4:00:28] fzybny: B
[4:00:31] Emm_Zee: Rise exists
[4:00:31] pedrodaboch4: A
[4:00:33] mutelibmb: definetly A
[4:00:33] RSRonin: I'd put it B
[4:00:36] Wincrediboy: how can S3 be rated higher than almost every dungeon in S3?
[4:00:37] atamdev: because better dungeons
[4:00:38] Morayeden: I'd rather have a bad seasonal than no seasonal
[4:00:41] whodatboizzzz: season 1 overranked
[4:00:43] Madgeneto: @guynormally better that way
[4:00:47] d4_damager_: season 3 just one shot city
[4:00:50] andaroo: @Wincrediboy agree
[4:00:51] miraagex: s1 and s3 kinda equal
[4:00:56] Armagaren: the tuning is great so far but the dungeons suck
[4:00:59] stuffiexo: it could be S because theres no DF dungeons (excluding rise/fall)
[4:01:11] Kayjin1223: High B low A
[4:01:15] ufanger: Shadowlands M+ >>>>> all
[4:01:16] Tsinis: the timer  being more fporgiving is DEFINITELY a factor  that help this seasomn
[4:01:19] Frawtarius: @stuffiexo Absolutely cooked take
[4:01:19] LionButLeon: @Armagaren I think it's the other way around, oneshots are insane lol.
[4:01:23] whodatboizzzz: cope
[4:01:32] Rahven__: s3 class balance + no terrbile seasonal just made it better than s1
[4:01:38] ArcaneJhin: i swear seasonal made dungeons easier if you played them right, especially mana wise and damage amps
[4:01:38] kj01a: This is the first season I got KSM and am close to KSH, so its DDDD for me :D
[4:01:42] Lantash: make ele shaman great again
[4:01:50] LionButLeon: @Lantash THIS
[4:01:54] miraagex: @Rahven__ arcane mages losing to shitty leather users in raid ST is awful balance
[4:01:54] zzzDai: does MDI have legend?
[4:01:55] Madgeneto: @Rahven__ s1 had better balance tho
[4:01:56] mutelibmb: season 3, everybody I know has 3k rio at least
[4:01:58] narthy_poo: @kj01a Grats!
[4:02:01] Wincrediboy: This list feels like it's puit together for people pushing 27+, not most of the playerbase
[4:02:02] larkhill: hunter in fall Pog
[4:02:11] Whitewolf1441: ww?
[4:02:18] LionButLeon: YE true
[4:02:26] bullyybeef: I feel like I'm seeing a lot more casuals hit 3k this season
[4:02:26] d4_damager_: @Rahven__ yeah but mages still steal the caster slot no matter what
[4:02:37] Rahven__: @Rahven__ ye but i hated thundering
[4:02:40] zzzDai: also what key level is MDI on?
[4:02:48] ohfoeshow: ret just got boosted
[4:02:50] LionButLeon: Ele xdd
[4:02:53] Bwelder87: who cares about mdi tho
[4:02:58] SniggleJake572: @Wincrediboy ya, bc that is who is in the call
[4:03:00] ohfoeshow: theres a ret pally on every corner now
[4:03:01] 1_7_4: yep WW cranks
[4:03:03] Camelbak21: Ele Keku
[4:03:05] miraagex: @Wincrediboy why would you ever think that they would discuss stuff for low key players?
[4:03:09] Vikinick: WW just obliterates
[4:03:17] CoffeeASAP: I'm still playing ww ALOO
[4:03:21] Thoreya: ww <3
[4:03:25] ohfoeshow: WW is fun despite serenity
[4:03:27] trumpzyy: season 1 >
[4:03:29] Wincrediboy: @SniggleJake572 They usually do make a point of thinking about the broader population, guess not for this video though
[4:03:34] cloudberrylive: A tier
[4:03:41] Kayjin1223: The most recent round of buffs has really closed the gap.
[4:03:43] nekitamocika: S1 > S3 󠀀
[4:03:44] Oracle_WoW: if all tanks had Silence Sigil they'd all be fine
[4:03:45] SniggleJake572: @Wincrediboy eh, very rarely tbh
[4:03:51] Thoreya: s3 by far the best season in df imo
[4:03:53] Morayeden: LetHimJoel
[4:03:58] Byggareebob: Every tank can be played cause s3 has no tank dmg compared to s2
[4:04:04] swerllwow: Yes
[4:04:08] swerllwow: good take
[4:04:12] Krappyboi: Cap mob damage scaling at 25 or something
[4:04:12] captainnetz: damn good take
[4:04:12] d4_damager_: make more sustained damage so healers have to heal instead of being a shitty dps
[4:04:18] garkovankovic: @Byggareebob utterly untrue
[4:04:20] shych00: The Ellesmere take
[4:04:20] miraagex: @Wincrediboy cmon, u follow Max for 2 years. you should know that 0 content is produced here for lowlvl players
[4:04:22] NattyPally: @Byggareebob tell me you only do 20's without telling me you only do 20's
[4:04:32] 1_7_4: @Byggareebob tott and dht ?
[4:04:34] Alarius_: split wow pvp off into its own game so they stop making balance decisions in pve for pvp
[4:04:43] OspreyRed: @Wincrediboy their perspectives are based on their experiences. At best they can speculate what other people think or feel, and they note it at times
[4:04:43] alufricent: That is not true sadly
[4:04:45] Frawtarius: @Byggareebob Why has nobody said that to any of the tanks in my keys the past couple weeks xd
[4:04:56] Oorvik1: What if keys scaled to a certain level then keys above that just start subtracting from the timer?
[4:05:08] zzzDai: I really dislike that because that just turns into only uncapped classes are viable.
[4:05:10] nick08_wow: tyranical already does that but fortified is backwards
[4:05:13] garkovankovic: im quite sure prot paladin and vdh are the only tanks capable of doing r1 keys
[4:05:13] just_ok_viewer: auto attacks should scale but aoe dmg shouldnt as much
[4:05:18] nick08_wow: dmg scales faster than mob health on fortified
[4:05:18] zzzDai: Because the answer to higher hp mobs is pull all of them
[4:05:21] SniggleJake572: it will ALWAYS be the limiting factor in an infinite scaling mode....
[4:05:34] guynanigans: just got in. is this tier list based on difficulty? cause (as a holy priest seasons 1 & 3 and a disc priest season 2) i love some of the dungeons in f and d tier
[4:05:39] Kayjin1223: I would agree if they uncapped more AOEs.
[4:05:40] daftnatetv: getting 1 shot feels good for nobody...dps get frustrated and healers feel completely useless...it's just bad for the game
[4:05:49] luxumbra69: dont reduce Health beyond 25.... that's half the fun
[4:05:50] Kayjin1223: With capped AOEs damage being the limiting factor is still a big issue.
[4:05:52] guynormally: @guynanigans enjoyment
[4:05:52] miraagex: @guynanigans have you been doing 30+ keys?
[4:05:53] Wafzig: I LOVE the shorter timer over 25 idea
[4:06:03] Tsinis: for the common folk the limiting factor being the amount of dps is not great
[4:06:06] Wincrediboy: @miraagex Usually I think there's more discussion of it. Maybe I've just missed it today, have been dropping in and out
[4:06:07] RSRonin: Doggy peepoAwesome
[4:06:22] guynanigans: @miraagex i suck ass. 20-24s xD
[4:06:23] LionButLeon: xdd
[4:06:28] Thoreya: A
[4:06:35] guynanigans: @guynormally thank you =D
[4:06:36] sinfulways01: season ones are fun tho
[4:06:38] miraagex: @Wincrediboy ye. it's usually always discussions about mythic raids and 28+ keys
[4:06:39] pedrodaboch4: A
[4:06:40] ghostdog_xd: after 25 stop scaling damage but keep scaling health
[4:06:46] garkovankovic: @guynanigans everythings enjoyable on 20-24 xd
[4:06:50] brainrot_behavior: @Tsinis I agree. Tho if it's higher keys where it becomes the problem then it should play out alright I guess
[4:06:52] Blasten: Bolstering Sanguine :S
[4:06:52] RipThatGuySean: rise is a huge stinker
[4:07:03] fzybny: Forgot about easier affixes in S3, yeah S3 > S1.
[4:07:03] zNzUV: dude make affix buffs instead of debuffs every week u get a dif buff it would be pretty amazing @Maximum
[4:07:05] dachako: bro uldaman should be a hard F altogether with rise…
[4:07:13] LionButLeon: BfA GIGACHAD
[4:07:17] atamdev: 100$ BFA
[4:07:17] Morayeden: BfA GIGACHAD
[4:07:18] miraagex: BFA > SL > Legion > DF
[4:07:24] atamdev: 100%*
[4:07:28] Is_Hamm: BFA for high keys and Legion for low-mid keys
[4:07:31] LionButLeon: @miraagex SL over DF is crazy
[4:07:33] Mokry_kek: bfa by far the best
[4:07:35] nightst314: infested
[4:07:39] LionButLeon: SL dungeons Bedge
[4:07:39] notSobar: corruption was so fun
[4:07:41] ArcticFortune: Maw of Souls GIGACHAD
[4:07:44] sembrah: Dungeons were better no matter what
[4:07:45] bigmeanbeefy: And thats why BFA was a good expansion, that and raids
[4:07:47] sembrah: stop actinc max
[4:07:50] Shurafna: SL was the best
[4:07:54] Veszyx_: This tier list sponsored by Big Dungeon.
[4:07:56] cloudberrylive: legion swapping legendaries
[4:07:58] ortemismw: wait i just joined how is underrot S??
[4:08:04] miraagex: @LionButLeon DoS, SD and HoA are my 3 favorite dungeons over any DF dungeon by a mile (even my lovely AA)
[4:08:07] Mokry_kek: bfa 8.3 peak wow, now game is dead, gg
[4:08:12] luxumbra69: shadowlands dungeons were just insanely BiS
[4:08:20] fzybny: SL > DF easy with Encrypted and just better dungeons.
[4:08:24] LionButLeon: @miraagex sad
[4:08:28] ufanger: shadowlands S+
[4:08:33] IsThatGuyOK: Nobody remembers Shadowlands??
[4:08:36] miraagex: Convenants interaction was goated
[4:08:41] MVPBuster: shadowlands encrypted Gladge
[4:08:54] Morayeden: BFA>SL>DF>Legion
[4:08:55] batu_x96: bfa corruption season best season ever
[4:08:56] LSDwight: shadowlands was so good
[4:09:00] CoffeeASAP: lol
[4:09:02] Veszyx_: @isthatguyok They also forgot about Dre.
[4:09:06] hearthjacks: very cool conversation
[4:09:11] fzybny: SL Encrypted with Gambit, I was happy every time.
[4:09:24] guynanigans: @fzybny this!
[4:09:30] miraagex: KEKW
[4:09:40] carmlost: @maximum freehold not being S means you have zero accountability to the truth
[4:09:50] Maximum: @carmlost it was S in BFA
[4:09:51] LionButLeon: faded af
[4:09:55] Maximum: BFA freehold best dungeon of all time
[4:10:00] LionButLeon: baseg
[4:10:01] HavoksThorn: Just think. Fated Mythic Tindral!
[4:10:04] bigolmilkymoos: I still fucking love arbys 󠀀
[4:10:12] carmlost: Alright I’m still holding the pitchfork but I’m coming around
[4:10:13] xJorbash: xdd
[4:10:18] GrimFandango: "zero accountability to the truth" goes so hard @carmlost
[4:10:18] jcole19: with the fated season is all three raids playable
[4:10:20] Morayeden: JB is right
[4:10:21] TBouse: should make Underrot top of A because it wasnt a whole tier above a lot of those A dungeons
[4:10:21] 1_7_4: xdd
[4:10:23] d4_damager_: @Maximum corruption junkyard
[4:10:24] WingedChipmunk: @carmlost freehold was poorly tuned with the changes, and alot of the boss mechincs being PURE rng feels bad
[4:10:30] Korupcija_: jb would love classic if they introduce M+
[4:10:33] guynanigans: @Maximum the music and the pig RP was awesome
[4:10:35] kaazisemaj: tindral is the worst
[4:10:41] tobbs94: if you're skill gaped by the players around you proging fights like this is a nightmare, if not they are fun. imo
[4:10:43] larkhill: player vs raid leader take
[4:10:44] bigolmilkymoos: BFA>DF=SL>Legion corrupted motherlode absolutely banged
[4:11:06] Maximum: @larkhill nah
[4:11:06] CoffeeASAP: soccer boss PepeLaugh
[4:11:07] miraagex: binary checks MUST be present on every boss 2nd half of the raid
[4:11:07] Uwea: gyat
[4:11:16] 1_7_4: based
[4:11:34] Morayeden: JB is so BASED
[4:11:34] RaptorJebus7: homie is 100% on point
[4:11:38] tobbs94: exactly.
[4:11:41] miraagex: Then dont do it LMAO
[4:11:42] carmlost: The biggest fuck you the devs have ever done to us was make one of the hardest bosses of all time a fucking owl. It’s uncanny how big their middle finger is. Unwavering home wreckers.
[4:11:44] tobbs94: its the skill gap
[4:11:47] regular_rusty: 100% right
[4:11:48] miraagex: get better
[4:11:51] miraagex: xdd
[4:11:52] Emm_Zee: As a ranged my first 2 raid nights on tindral I had literally 0 agency in whether we progressed or not
[4:12:17] Korupcija_: you can't tell world 300 guild to get better, world 300 is really good
[4:12:23] HavoksThorn: @carmlost This is their revenge for all the Boomkin slander.
[4:12:24] atamdev: Yeah, blizzard hard fucked up on the nerf timing for this raid
[4:12:25] Never_Go_Full_Kappa: I remember waiting for like 2 hours for a healer to not die to the monk dance in battle for dazar
[4:12:25] arxi0: i mean he's 100% right here lets be honest
[4:12:28] Korupcija_: in grand scheme of things
[4:12:29] jefubi: yeah star augur was just like that. Just 10 minutes hoping a single person nobody fucks up for 3 hours @maximum
[4:12:37] miraagex: Last 2-3 raid bosses must be super hard like Jailer
[4:12:41] miraagex: or Tindy
[4:12:42] ZordiakZero: Wiping on a single mistake? Sounds like 14 Savage fights this expansion.
[4:12:44] i_cassius: The answer is Liquid coaching
[4:12:48] EdenKoala: yeah as another WR300 gamer tindral was only killable after the nerfs 100%
[4:13:19] miraagex: @EdenKoala my guild was wiping to Flares and Mushrooms, but not to seeds lol
[4:13:23] psitos: @Maximum Can you save Growl?
[4:14:07] EdenKoala: @miraagex i guess everyone has different problems but after the nerfs we basicly jumped instantly to 0,7% after like 5 trys
[4:14:08] moxterity: P1 walking simulator
[4:14:16] bigolmilkymoos: corruption season banged as hard as arbys classic beef and cheddar meal (it was goated)
[4:14:19] nick08_wow: lords of dread was horrible too. When someone fucks up it increases the chance of other people to fuck up dodging the slimes. And then it's a never ending cycle. Hated it
[4:15:16] eolin89: BFA M+ was the most fun i ever had with m+
[4:15:27] friendshrimp: @maximum show growls stream
[4:15:30] weezull: its baffling they didn't do it that way
[4:15:33] smashwow: ooooor hear me out.... do that from the beginning
[4:15:40] miraagex: Some funny people think that mythic raid is for everyone. It's a place for gigadedicated people to have fun, because heroic and normal raids are piss jokes. Mythic raids have to be hard, like Tindral hard
[4:15:48] KeyboardDeath: The fact that u NEED a WA is a problem with design
[4:16:02] Skyfall715: healing adds with no unit frames is awful too
[4:16:04] Maximum: @KeyboardDeath you dont need one it just makes it easiewr
[4:16:09] Maximum: thats what all weak auras do
[4:16:10] LionButLeon: me as ele xdd
[4:16:43] hottfuzz24: awful
[4:16:49] Slapsstick: green is atonement, grey is none
[4:16:50] eipii: awesome ui
[4:16:51] Toointro: I hate it
[4:16:57] arxi0: those raid frames are hideous
[4:16:58] Nollychi: Solid
[4:16:58] LionButLeon: WAYTOODANK
[4:16:59] Rebizle: healers do weird shit with their colors man
[4:17:00] Hemenia: healer here, disapprove of this ui
[4:17:02] Rebizle: messes with me
[4:17:02] Faraday5001: it could be worse... my guilds disc doesnt even track atonement
[4:17:03] BigTrout3: KEKW
[4:17:04] alexchopstix: WTF is that raid color
[4:17:06] prugar: @Maximum he removed class colors so he can see atonements better
[4:17:06] CoffeeASAP: to be fair growl is color blind to all colors but green
[4:17:08] Slapsstick: I dont mind it for disc, itd be ass otherwise tho
[4:17:09] alexchopstix: weird ass raid frames
[4:17:09] EdenKoala: Disc Priest shit what can you say
[4:17:10] Vikinick: there's no borders between the individual frames
[4:17:10] jjwallababy: I would like this as a healer
[4:17:10] HavoksThorn: As a healer, I like it. Its easy to tell.
[4:17:14] maulinx: jbs is criminal
[4:17:14] AJbgodx: KEKW
[4:17:14] RemwayTV: we are already mentally defeated so we just dont care @Maximum
[4:17:15] downbeatx: his is real bad
[4:17:16] eipii: healers are like hockey goalies.
[4:17:17] 1_7_4: KEKW
[4:17:20] alexchopstix: that is trash
[4:17:21] Whitewolf1441: TASTE is a LUXURY for us healers
[4:17:31] Threatslive: megaset ui is bad
[4:17:41] LionButLeon: xdd
[4:17:41] Readyforbagels: @Maximum do a mythic raid run without WAs for content, just raw doggin base UI
[4:17:41] IAmSolari: Jb with the runescape ass UI
[4:17:44] miraagex: xdd
[4:17:45] Rebizle: grey for things going on too lmao
[4:17:47] misran: jb got those TBC grid raid frames
[4:17:55] carmlost: It’s grey without healing so he’s actually depressed if he’s not topping people
[4:17:58] IAttackYou: ayayaxdd
[4:17:58] hearthjacks: what healer has a good ui
[4:17:58] prugar: @Maximum@Maximum he removed class colors so he can see atonements better
[4:18:06] hottfuzz24: cap
[4:18:09] CoffeeASAP: true lol
[4:18:11] novembersdoom: True
