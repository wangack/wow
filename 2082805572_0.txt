[0:16:31] Mergaam: Mergaam subscribed with Prime. 
[0:16:36] lunamists: thats fair

[0:18:53] UncleKak: feel like everyone is getting bad headaches right now, had an awful one yesterday
[0:18:59] Kimdah_: Trees are blooming already

[0:19:34] fragmonkey71: sinuses are crappy this time of year
[0:19:53] Kimdah_: Ten degrees?! A whole degree higher than here
[0:20:07] ImperfectDark: i went for an eye test recently because of headaches and the lady told me not to use the computer or phones or tv too much and to go outside. I said i suppose i can look out the window now and then
[0:20:10] Fenundria: Torghast is easier in DF, right?
[0:20:25] naseem529: wowgraGoodJob wowgraGoodJob wowgraGoodJob
[0:20:31] Pathstrider: same got exalted too and finished that meta
[0:20:33] keyboardturner: that reputation is still so bizarre to me
[0:20:37] bojackhorseman2004: you know what be a great video "Torghast revisited" like a fresh PoV from somone who is doing torgast an expansion later without all the noise around it
[0:20:45] keyboardturner: surely it has to be tied to something in the future
[0:20:47] bojackhorseman2004: and a true objective look at the actual game mode
[0:21:25] bojackhorseman2004: and maybe give your take on how blizzard can make it "evergreen"
[0:21:36] Kimdah_: What keeps me from having headaches from gaming is that I regularly go outside for a smoke (I know, disgusting habit, I don‚Äôt smoke that much tbh)
[0:21:41] ellenara35: and solo LFR maybe?
[0:22:13] Monran: Monran subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 9 months! neato

[0:23:55] lunamists: theres always the option of taking her in the carrier! :D

[0:30:12] Samiccus: MrsGM and BabyGM
[0:30:17] bojackhorseman2004: does wowhead have any streamers who stream for them? they should partner up with a streamer for "official wowhead news livestreamed"
[0:30:22] ImperfectDark: what evolution do you think you'll go for with Eevee?
[0:30:38] bojackhorseman2004: wait legit? xD
[0:30:45] Fenundria: why did you get blocked? :D
[0:30:45] MachoCham: I mean Annie was the closest right?

[0:30:51] monstayou7: what'd u do?
[0:30:51] Suze_o_0: wth Dano, what did you do to WoWhead?
[0:30:52] bojackhorseman2004: why would she do that?
[0:30:54] keyboardturner: she blocks like everyone, has me blocked too lol
[0:30:54] Jansman: @leakies_lil_rat aww well said :)
[0:31:00] Layliah79: why?! LOL
[0:31:01] databob1: Wait does she have the extra Es in her name "Eevee"
[0:31:02] Harai_Ulfsark: @bojackhorseman2004 they used to have something like that, i dont think they do it anymore
[0:31:03] Tidewell: why?
[0:31:18] Samiccus: The block wars!
[0:31:30] Fenundria: I'd watch a celebrity fight between Asmon and Taliesin :D
[0:31:35] MachoCham: It's ok to keep your online space curated to what you want to see
[0:31:37] Kimdah_: Evie
[0:31:40] Sery_Bot: A 90 second ad break is starting! Thank you for sticking with us through this break! seryboLove Ads help support my content. Consider subscribing to remove ads and support the stream!
[0:31:42] ImperfectDark: good Dad rightthere
[0:31:43] bojackhorseman2004: feel like just not having a twitter is easier than blocking everyone in the wow community xD
[0:32:08] MachoCham: Asmon is taller right? So statistically has a better chance of coming out on top
[0:32:20] MachoCham: Unless it's the celebrity boxing and a work
[0:32:30] databob1: Aw still a nice name though
[0:33:03] Dirtnose: As long as we ignore Cena beating the Nexus in 2010
[0:33:11] Sery_Bot: The ad break is finishing now! seryboLove
[0:33:40] ImperfectDark: i think shadehound is always bugged on my server for some reason. never appears
[0:33:41] Fenundria: any prediction on when a potential graphics update might be coming for WoW? last one was at the end of MoP
[0:33:45] Kimdah_: My daughter is 4, and she‚Äôs obsessed over Pok√©mon.. She even got to pick a starter. Starting at the VERY beginning obviously. Anyone that can guess what starter she picked?!
[0:33:50] iceewater93: once you get exalted with venari you can do the Bound Shadehound mount quest
[0:33:50] KaisenSiru: I remember getting that mount the first week we got access to it
[0:33:57] bojackhorseman2004: Cena got allot of hate when he "called out" the rock for the drama of him using wrestling as a stepping stone, but they made up
[0:34:02] ratgefingah: dont they gradually update stuff?
[0:34:04] Suze_o_0: ok guys!! exciting day today, new PC gets put together!
[0:34:09] Fenundria: WoD prepatch yes sy
[0:34:14] ratgefingah: like hyenas and stuff
[0:34:15] MediumRareOG: why are arsenals so expensive? 200 marks of honor is so many
[0:34:16] MachoCham: 2012 wants a word with you about Cena, literally inspired a shirt you own
[0:34:17] ratgefingah: houses
[0:34:23] Dirtnose: @Kimdah_ always bulbasaur
[0:34:24] Fenundria: character update yes :)
[0:34:28] Cabbageman007: Anything you can "leak" that will get me excited for this patch?
[0:34:36] ratgefingah: I think characters look fine
[0:34:49] Kimdah_: @zarulu She chose Charmander
[0:35:12] bojackhorseman2004: yes, leak it all to us
[0:35:15] bojackhorseman2004: we wont tell
[0:35:17] monstayou7: what are your thoughts on Asmongolds take of deleting all addons?
[0:35:19] Frijid: because you're a GM Kappa
[0:35:23] ratgefingah: they need to update hydras, lions and giraffes/okapis tho
[0:35:34] Suze_o_0: @Frijid lmao
[0:35:37] Kimdah_: @monstayou7 He just wants clout
[0:35:37] monstayou7: I've removed all mine cuz i was bored and i quite enjoy it tbh
[0:35:40] MachoCham: Can't put the genie back in the bottle
[0:35:46] Dirtnose: @Kimdah_ Also a great choice ^^
[0:35:46] keyboardturner: he has a lot of bad takes frankly, more often lately than not
[0:35:59] angelo_solaris: sup sup
[0:36:06] Fenundria: any chance on smashing Jaina this week too? :D
[0:36:14] MachoCham: Wow tried to take away some agency from WeakAuras with Private aura's and look how that went
[0:36:19] StreamElements: Click on my link www.hellofresh.co.uk/MRGM60 and order your Box for less than ¬£4
[0:36:28] bojackhorseman2004: I agree with the point that addons kind ruin aspects of the game, but imo you have to redesign wow completly
[0:37:05] bojackhorseman2004: Thinking mostly for pvp, m+ and raids
[0:37:08] Kimdah_: RIO can go burn tbh
[0:37:29] MachoCham: As in score?
[0:37:32] Thoreya: never touch my addons, go play without them
[0:37:33] Thoreya: thanks
[0:37:44] MachoCham: A form of Raider.io has been around forever, we just called it other things before like Gearscore
[0:37:45] angelo_solaris: only stuff i run is bagon and and like pawn/actioner and rotation heplers
[0:37:49] Dirtnose: can you imagine the community uproar if they banned addons
[0:37:50] bojackhorseman2004: ofc, thats why i said they had to redesign wow if they want to remove addons.
[0:37:56] bojackhorseman2004: which just isnt possible
[0:37:58] ratgefingah: ooh addons, my german brain thought of expansions lmao. now I see how using addon for both can be a problem xd
[0:38:05] Thoreya: he has bad wow takes
[0:38:16] Thoreya: its okay to disagree with asmongod
[0:38:17] Monran: I feel like the second they *hypothetically* ban addons, the same people calling for them banned would call for them to come back
[0:38:20] Kimdah_: @machocham It‚Äôs more that they rely on rio scores too much
[0:38:30] Dirtnose: Does he even play wow retail anymore?
[0:38:41] Monran: Also there's bad takes and then there's asmon bad
[0:38:41] Rife_: i liked torghast a lot
[0:38:43] s7wede: Addons should only be able to access the out of combat API. Once you require addons to help mitigate the number of mechanics an encounter throws at you, you lose the majority of the argument that it's become a convoluted mess.
[0:38:45] Thoreya: he doesnt play wow in general anymore
[0:39:01] Kimdah_: @thoreya Good riddance tbh
[0:39:05] keyboardturner: i mean lots of people also advocated for "no PTR" and "no datamining" and now look what the sentiment is Kapp
[0:39:05] bojackhorseman2004: Worst part of asmongs take is the thousands of hes viewrs who are gonna echo them and it will effect what the devs think the community actually wants
[0:39:20] Thoreya: @s7wede what addon mitigates mechanics for a player?
[0:39:32] NeeK_23: afternoon
[0:39:37] Ithylz: @Monran There are people who will always be complaining whatever happens
[0:39:37] s7wede: All that private auras did was make it a requirement to use a macro to get around it.
[0:39:38] databob1: There's no need to reset wow anything they could do coukd be done with the current game. If I loose my collection I'm gone.
[0:39:43] bojackhorseman2004: Private auras are bypassed by just having a macro that you press when you "have the aura" on you.
[0:39:59] NeeK_23: just having a date would help so much
[0:40:05] angelo_solaris: cause i can never remember phases i refuse to use IO and stuff like mechwarnings i like learning to read em
[0:40:09] RosieSeren: Yeah it being a surprise is a fun, but being teased about a surprise for so long is just exhausting
[0:40:29] Thoreya: like a month ago
[0:40:29] RosieSeren: feels like so long ago now xD
[0:40:30] Thoreya: lol
[0:40:31] NeeK_23: it started around 20th Jan
[0:40:38] Monran: This has been the longest 2 months ever lmao
[0:40:39] bojackhorseman2004: isnt this just a normal content dought we have at the end of every xpac? nothing new
[0:40:46] NeeK_23: then around 6th feb Holly did the post
[0:40:52] Thoreya: @bojackhorseman2004 yes
[0:40:53] bojackhorseman2004: the diffrence is we have the roadmap and they cant really put up a point "content drought"
[0:40:54] Thoreya: nothing new
[0:41:05] RosieSeren: they should of saved it for like a week before, hype it and then  drop it, would of worked much better
[0:41:10] Rife_: pretty sure 10.2.6 is going to be a MUCH smaller patch than people are expecting and the silence is hyping up a big "secret" that people are going to be disappointed by
[0:41:13] ratgefingah: what was in 10.2.5?
[0:41:16] MediumRareOG: Asmon's addon take is that encounters now get designed with DBM/weakaura in mind. it's an arms race. Addons create a barrier to entry and they've become necessary. It would be better if you didn't NEED addons to do raids
[0:41:17] ratgefingah: oh yea gilneas
[0:41:20] Thoreya: this is the downsides of having a roadmap..ppl are content hungry more now than before
[0:41:31] Ithylz: I don't think we should expect a lot for 10.2.6. It will prob be pretty minor
[0:41:47] Thoreya: @MediumRareOG you dont need addons to raid heroic
[0:41:48] Harai_Ulfsark: hair color for trolls and skin color for draenei?
[0:41:55] ratgefingah: I was done with 10.2.5 in a day
[0:41:56] s7wede: 10.2.5 Was the Gilneas questline, Archives and Azerothian Dragonriding. Very good QOL patch, but content wise it was quite light
[0:41:59] NeeK_23: people are talking about droughts when its been 7 weeks, its crazy
[0:42:06] bojackhorseman2004: I am already dissepointed Kappa
[0:42:07] Calfast: @MediumRareOG He's over a decade late for that take tbh
[0:42:08] Thoreya: "need" is completely subjective
[0:42:11] ImperfectDark: people just hype themselves up to the point of utter disappointment
[0:42:11] Ithylz: Oh yeah I wasn't saying that in a bad way :D
[0:42:25] SlithTheSivak: this is content people in classic can participate in too?
[0:42:26] angelo_solaris: And the only reason than evern before my hardcore quit cause of m+ burnout i decided to stop looking a build and play and  trial and error build
[0:42:26] MediumRareOG: @Calfast it's not a new take
[0:42:34] Thoreya: max was saying he thinks 10.2.6 will be cool, idk what he knows tho
[0:42:54] NeeK_23: btw did you see my post about the vote mounts? do you think the last 2 mounts might be soon? works with upcoming content
[0:43:02] Calfast: @MediumRareOG Yeah but it's far, far too late now
[0:43:05] databob1: I would have been happier being overhyped that would of been something.  This secret stuff is killing my intrest
[0:43:30] Ithylz: @Thoreya It's just his opinion
[0:43:41] NeeK_23: catapillar and Nerubian crawler
[0:43:47] ratgefingah: I think they shadowdrop tww for free in 10.2.6 Kappa
[0:43:47] Harai_Ulfsark: we're missing the caterpillar and the spider/nerubian thing
[0:43:48] bojackhorseman2004: 10.2.6 is gonna be a story line that happend in season of discovery but will end in retail. Its gonna introduce the "connected narrative" story thing. Calling it : p
[0:43:54] leakies_lil_rat: Time for bread.. good night Mr.GM collector of all things... and laters @samiccus u dirty poor excuse for a Canadian skuff rattie dk <3
[0:43:59] angelo_solaris: cause i find it more fun find the build that works instead of just going but what is best
[0:44:22] MachoCham: @bojackhorseman2004 Multiverse?
[0:44:24] Thoreya: @Ithylz nah he gets intel sometimes with wow stuff, like s4 of SL he knew way before
[0:44:32] angelo_solaris: works for you
[0:44:43] MachoCham: What if Season of Discovery happened in the WoD timeline
[0:44:47] NeeK_23: @MachoCham the SoD thing
[0:44:49] StreamElements: dracJAM TWITCH PRIME dracJAM
[0:45:02] bojackhorseman2004: Exactly
[0:45:03] SlithTheSivak: the wow multiverse?
[0:45:13] bojackhorseman2004: and they are testing it so they can do it more with xalatath
[0:45:46] MachoCham: Can't wait to log in to 10.2.6 and log in to classic with my retail main to help boost

[0:45:54] Ithylz: @Thoreya Their discord with the dev is mainly gameplay/raid/tuning related. What they know is often just 1 bit in a convo (for instance: "We're removing X for next patch" but that's it)
[0:46:01] Eprosis: I don't want to play sod to get the full story :(
[0:46:03] angelo_solaris: i still remember when the threat on statue for brew was broken and it could aggro the whole dungeon
[0:46:25] Thoreya: @Ithylz he went out to dinner with the main dev that did s4 LUL
[0:46:29] NeeK_23: im now leveling Shadowlands professions.....damn it Dan, youve got me going SL 100% things too
[0:46:31] MachoCham: What if we get player housing but only in SoD KEKW
[0:47:11] bojackhorseman2004: but retail has had a problem of introducing new characters and making it feels forced, which they absolutly need. Adding them to SoD would make it feel like less of a retcon when somone has "been there all along"
[0:47:13] bojackhorseman2004: even thou it is
[0:47:21] Monran: wait, can't you use the foam sword toy on these
[0:47:24] databob1: @mrgm I wonder if the lack of information has something to do with the layoffs
[0:47:25] NeeK_23: old professions are so dull compared to DF, it forgot how much it improved
[0:47:50] MachoCham: @databob1 X for doubt. I think it's more that they wanted something completely blind
[0:47:51] Ithylz: @Thoreya Yeah but it doesn't mean he will tell anything :D T&E have had dinner with Terran but he's a tomb so who knows :D
[0:48:07] Fenundria: imagine the Jailer popping up in Molten Core SoD instead of Ragnaros :D
[0:48:08] bojackhorseman2004: If they added jailer to SoD then people could just shit on him and he would never make it to the main game, would be so much better outcome than what we have atm
[0:48:48] MachoCham: Imagine if y'know if after the world soul saga it turned out the Jailer was behind it all
[0:48:54] MachoCham: And it was just a seed planted
[0:49:00] MachoCham: Which becomes a masterstroke
[0:49:03] MediumRareOG: the jailer was probably a robot, let's be real
[0:49:04] Thoreya: @Ithylz i wish i was as naive as u haha
[0:49:36] bojackhorseman2004: Still cant wait for the "thing to come" that the jailed warned us about Kappa

[0:49:42] s7wede: All titans are constructs of the first ones
[0:50:01] bojackhorseman2004: no the jailer warned us about somthing when we defeated him
[0:50:13] MachoCham: Yeah, probably titans
[0:50:15] s7wede: NO
[0:50:18] Fenundria: the Jailer is the friends we made along the way
[0:50:23] bojackhorseman2004: thats why he wanted to unite the universe or some shit
[0:50:25] NeeK_23: the First Ones are the players from Classic LuL
[0:50:28] s7wede: the first ones are kinda like god
[0:50:45] MachoCham: As both sides of the cosmos will rally against it. So Azeroth is corrupted as Sargeras said and that is what to come
[0:50:49] Monran: he was warning us about SoD MiniK
[0:50:51] bojackhorseman2004: classic blizzard is to dig holes then to fill them
[0:51:11] Sery_Bot: The ad break is finishing now! seryboLove
[0:51:20] StreamElements: Dynamic GROUND Mounts Coming to World of Warcraft? - https://youtu.be/3eLdJTCnhGg
[0:51:35] MachoCham: Sometimes I think this is why Blizzard don't do overarching stories because the lore community shit blood whenever there isn't instant gratification
[0:51:38] Harai_Ulfsark: didnt buy dragonflight KEKWAIT
[0:52:07] MediumRareOG: blizzard just gave up on SL and wrapped it up a patch early
[0:52:07] MachoCham: Passionate is one way of spelling Toxic. (This is my opinion, not Dan's)
[0:52:21] NeeK_23: @MachoCham im anemic from my lore love
[0:53:13] Monran: that'd be neat
[0:53:23] bojackhorseman2004: "The 5 great missed opportunities of wow"
[0:53:27] MachoCham: It's a bit like shitting on Star Wars after only watching Empire Strikes Back without any context of Return of the Jedi
[0:53:38] NeeK_23: Farahlon 100%, it was mentioned in Chronicle, it became Netherstorm, but WoD just cut it
[0:53:42] bojackhorseman2004: "The 5 times blizzard had to throw it in the bin"
[0:53:49] keyboardturner: everything is a missed opportunity according to the lore community Kapp
[0:53:50] Fenundria: one way the game could pull me back is if they add like an MSQ kinda system which lets me play through each expansion's story in order including raids too
[0:54:05] NeeK_23: it was in the data
[0:54:42] Monran: beta ashran my beloved
[0:54:49] MachoCham: We had that before chromie time that you had to level through expansion by expansion and it was a horrific experience
[0:54:58] Ithylz: @Thoreya Naive =/= wary :) If he knows something, good for him for sure
[0:55:01] bojackhorseman2004: thats gonna be the thumbnail with an arrow "whole island gone"
[0:55:30] bojackhorseman2004: isnt that what classic is? re releasing every xpac
[0:55:36] Monran: honestly with the follower dungeons they could prob pull that off as an option
[0:56:15] bojackhorseman2004: Sounds like a narrative addon could do that. Just show you which quest to take for the chronolocial wow experience
[0:56:16] MachoCham: The issue we have is that patch content changes the world. It's two sides of the coin - If it doesn't change the world then people shit blood that the world never evolves and there are no consequences
[0:56:19] StreamElements: Click on my link www.hellofresh.co.uk/MRGM60 and order your Box for less than ¬£4
[0:56:23] s7wede: The next logical use of the follower dungeon system is follower raids where it's scaled down to a 5 player instance. That way people can see the storyline right through expansions
[0:56:35] MachoCham: Then look at Icecrown in Wrath and the phasing issues
[0:56:38] NeeK_23: FF14 will have that issue soon, a new player being told to play 800 hours to get to the same point as other player at current will become off putting. It'll be interesting to see how they handle that
[0:57:11] magemaster225: Maybe when the heritage armor quests are done that group can make quests for expansion summaries
[0:57:14] Calfast: When I played iirc you got a level boost in FF14
[0:57:26] Calfast: But everyone was like "play the MSQ"
[0:57:30] Fenundria: which previous expansion do you look forward to completing the most?
[0:58:08] databob1: I just finished a relm reborn. I hated how they forced us through the story at the end we had no agency what so ever

[0:58:33] bojackhorseman2004: cant wait to the a dungeon in classic then log retail and do the same dungeon on m+
[0:59:10] MediumRareOG: the FF14 community are particularly rabid. say anything less than glowing praise and they come after you so hard
[0:59:12] Calfast: Story was good but I found FF14 so slow
[0:59:14] MachoCham: @databob1 Post ARR is a slog
[0:59:21] NeeK_23: @bojackhorseman2004 Vortex Pinnacle soon you can
[0:59:22] bojackhorseman2004: they said they arent innovating in m+ from the dev interviews
[0:59:34] bojackhorseman2004: they did say they arent gonna focus on it
[0:59:42] Monran: It was a neat experiment but I want new expansion dungeons for the first season of a new expansion, not a 50/50 split
[0:59:43] NeeK_23: did they say that??
[0:59:49] Monran: old dungeons for S2 onward is fine imo
[0:59:52] MachoCham: Remove Tyr and Fort
[0:59:57] keyboardturner: it's better than it was before at least
[1:00:11] bojackhorseman2004: i just want innovation
[1:00:18] bojackhorseman2004: the formula has gotten stale
[1:00:32] s7wede: Bellular put out a poll on M+ affixes and the majority at the moment want all affixes to go
[1:00:37] wow_addicted: hi, from a casual perspective i got 2.4k rio so it is easy
[1:00:51] MediumRareOG: they still need to get rid of key depletion
[1:00:56] MachoCham: Seasonal affixes are probably the best way
[1:01:06] magemaster225: bells poll was missing "just remove tyran+fort"
[1:01:33] wow_addicted: I play at the same rate as you mostly collecting stuff so it is chill to do all at +15/16 and have 2.4k rio
[1:01:37] MachoCham: Sorry that's what I mean
[1:01:38] Monran: replace tyran/fort with a seasonal. ezpz
[1:01:39] magemaster225: I saw it as only having tyran+fort
[1:01:43] MediumRareOG: both key depletion and dead keys still seem to be a problem with m+
[1:01:49] NeeK_23: removing affixes sounds good, but then every week will be the same and people will just burn out faster
[1:02:03] NeeK_23: you think you do but you dont
[1:02:36] s7wede: 1 seasonal affix would be fine if it was implemented well, but currently all affixes just make you have to do extra work for no reward. The best affixes to date were the encrypted and dreadlord from Shadowlands
[1:02:43] keyboardturner: the only issue with affixes I've had recently was sanguine in certain dungeons where mobs don't want to move, particularly like murozond's rise
[1:03:30] bojackhorseman2004: my problem with affixes is that most of them happen on a timer and are constant, affixes should add mobs which do those mechanics
[1:04:18] wow_addicted: so hear me out, leave mythic raid for very hardcore players and have a little better gear, for M+ do a leaderboard and every team have the same items when enter M+ and try to do as fast and as higher they can and give rewards to every participant doing a nr amount of dungeons every season also give top 10 something unique gold etc
[1:04:42] NeeK_23: the main issue with current affixes is that certain specs just cant do anything to stop them. Like Incorp and warriors
[1:04:46] Monran: so challenge modes but scaling infintely
[1:05:25] MachoCham: I keep hearing Mythic raids should only give cosmetics, so the same theory should apply to anything above a 15?
[1:05:27] ImperfectDark: Venari mount isn't guaranteed. It's in a paragon chest that you get for reputation gained after you reach exalted. Think i've farmed like 4-5 of those chests and still no mount :(
[1:05:33] NeeK_23: @wow_addicted like earning the Glad mount after a certain number of wins?
[1:05:34] keyboardturner: don't really care otherwise about M+, affixes are fine, no dungeon is really a dead key this season frankly, their difficulty feels like a nice spot. people exaggerate a lot  about stuff that's rather minute now
[1:05:39] jkuhl58: affixes should be class/spec neutral
[1:05:49] StreamElements: Check out my Socials! dracJAM  https://twitter.com/MrGMYT https://www.instagram.com/danmrgm https://www.patreon.com/MrGM https://discord.gg/MrGM https://www.youtube.com/c/MrGMYT https://www.tiktok.com/@mrgm_warcraft
[1:06:09] NeeK_23: @keyboardturner 100%. tiny issues become huge drama discourse at the moment
[1:06:53] wow_addicted: @NeeK_23 no, so you leave very unique rewards for top 10, and rewards any others teams that participate in that season and let say have done at least 20+ that season and you get the mount like is 2k mount now
[1:06:59] keyboardturner: murozond's rise was pretty bad pre-nerf, some of those were definitely deserved
[1:07:29] NeeK_23: also some keys and affixes are harder/easier if youre pugging or in a coordinated group. Afflicted is a non issue if coordinated, but in pugs it can be a nightmare
[1:07:36] bojackhorseman2004: wait, you are not gonna talk about a topic you have little knowledge about and dont do? how can you create drama and engagement then?
[1:07:40] wow_addicted: so ppl wont have to farm for gear bis etc, you got items give by the game and compete to do it faster and higher keys

[1:09:45] NeeK_23: also its compstomp so farm those marks for pvp tmog
[1:10:01] Calfast: Better than talking nonsense and looking stupid, for sure
[1:10:12] NeeK_23: topic are F tier
[1:10:13] Dirtnose: yep, f tier chocolate bar
[1:10:16] bojackhorseman2004: i love nuts and raisins in my chocolate
[1:10:22] ImperfectDark: nah no raisins in a topic
[1:10:27] ImperfectDark: just nuts and caramel
[1:10:31] mikeygames: It contained hazelnuts, nougat and caramel.
[1:10:42] NeeK_23: lets get onto the real content. Chocolate bar tier list
[1:10:43] ImperfectDark: maybe you're thinking of yorkie
[1:10:48] bojackhorseman2004: looks like a budget snickers
[1:10:49] wishkah82: picnic
[1:10:50] wow_addicted: @NeeK_23 sort of, but you farm and farm and have better gear, upgrades after upgrades but what if you try to do M+ with let say heroic tier set is the highest ilvl in the game, and you do M+ to beat the leaderboard, you got me?
[1:10:54] Minobard: ahh the lumpy bois
[1:10:55] ImperfectDark: yeah picnic was raisins
[1:11:14] bojackhorseman2004: in my country we have 3 types of chocolate bars and they are all great
[1:11:14] mikeygames: they do a new 'snickers' haven't tried it yet butterscotch
[1:11:24] bojackhorseman2004: then a bunch of importad garbage
[1:11:32] MachoCham: I'm really uncomfortable with the idea of Foley having another match
[1:11:33] mikeygames: UK, saw them in b&m
[1:11:37] NeeK_23: butterscotch snickers, I want this now
[1:11:54] MediumRareOG: nobody under 75 eats butterscotch
[1:11:55] mikeygames: brownie lion bars too and coconut lion!
[1:12:19] Dirtnose: no
[1:12:21] Calfast: YES
[1:12:22] mikeygames: I <3 bounties, I miss the dark one :(
[1:12:27] MachoCham: I don't mind a Bounty
[1:12:27] MediumRareOG: i don't like bounties because i don't like coconut
[1:12:28] bojackhorseman2004: bounties are good if you only have 1 single
[1:12:30] NeeK_23: I used to work with both those companies and I can tell you some spicy things in private LuL
[1:12:31] Calfast: Love a bounty
[1:12:49] bojackhorseman2004: bounties are sickly sweet
[1:12:51] Arlaeya: love the taste of coconut, hate the texture
[1:12:58] Calfast: Lots of assassinations
[1:13:04] MediumRareOG: coconut, l.ike coffee, is gross :)
[1:13:20] MachoCham: No flakes are flakey, bounties are bountiful
[1:13:31] mikeygames: any word on pirate thing yet?
[1:13:35] LuiBMHunter: coffee is awesome!
[1:13:40] NeeK_23: opinion on Boost, cant beat them imo

[1:29:26] Big_Rum: Today is a good day :)
[1:29:33] Big_Rum: How are you my friend
[1:29:42] Big_Rum: 50 days from disney and a cruise for 1
[1:30:02] MediumRareOG: have you extracted all your anima from any other covenants?
[1:30:15] s7wede: If you want a ton of Anima, do SOD and SOTFO on mythic. you walk out with around 5k for each raid
[1:30:26] Tauren0309: I'm 12 days away from Disney Paris :)
[1:30:26] Big_Rum: Also my new boss is kinda of a legend and a very god dude. so thats pretty exciting
[1:31:00] MediumRareOG: it rains anima in ZM
[1:31:09] Big_Rum: Yeah. We are going to dinner tonight ata fancy steakhouse so thats also pretty cool
[1:31:29] bojackhorseman2004: in the lore it rains anima
[1:31:30] Kubwa7: iirc...chest/rares/etc give a lot of anima
[1:31:42] MediumRareOG: i seem to remember getting 1k anima from ZM by just killing a few rares
[1:32:03] ImperfectDark: yeah i spent a couple of weeks farming Zereth Mortis for rares and chests
[1:32:59] Kubwa7: anima kinda game naturally trying for other things.  souls and grateful offerings were the things that had to be deliberately farmed :P
[1:33:04] Big_Rum: Don;t the rare in ZM drop a ton of anima? at least they used to
[1:33:11] fooxytv: oh shit..
[1:33:14] fooxytv: don't forget
[1:33:25] Big_Rum: Mothers day is in May in the US

[1:33:47] Kubwa7: Mother's Day?! It's not on the wow calendar, so how are we supposed to remember this Kappa
[1:33:53] bojackhorseman2004: cant you just go to your friends wedding and do the mothers day, the day before?
[1:34:24] Big_Rum: Do you have max rep with Vanari yet?
[1:34:55] databob1: Oh it's different in the UK. I almost had a heart attack thinking I forgot
[1:34:56] mermaidgeek_: wait they‚Äôre so comfy. and the baby will fit in them forever. my 20 month old still fits in his 3-6 month sleepies
[1:34:58] Etaranel: It's Christian. You're supposed to go back to your mother church, where you were baptised. Nothing to do with mums
[1:35:28] Kubwa7: mom's are just differrent in the UK Kappa
[1:36:07] MachoCham: Phew thank god I'm not part of a cult so I don't have to do anything

[1:38:51] michaelmm: Caffine Poisoning!
[1:38:58] MediumRareOG: that's depressing
[1:39:57] Monran: there's a bell somewhere nearby you ring
[1:40:01] Monran: and then run a maze
[1:40:12] Kubwa7: i kinda enjoy the special treasures you have to "unlock" as a one-time chest.
[1:40:56] Kubwa7: wonder if the powder stuff that makes it dark would make that easier
[1:41:26] MediumRareOG: why is the flight master's whistle not a toy?
[1:41:29] fooxytv: how long have you been streaming for?
[1:41:31] Monran: all this is reminding me that i need to do ember court daily now
[1:41:32] ImperfectDark: did you get the sundancer mount from Bastion?
[1:41:33] Kubwa7: i'd have it on all the time, if it were a toy #DarkMode
[1:41:52] Yuri__Sakura: feel like alot of small things like that should be toys
[1:41:55] fooxytv: no I mean since you went full time streaming LuL
[1:42:14] Calfast: And the massive CD
[1:42:21] RosieSeren: the comments on wowhead make it sound harder, but I found it quite easy to get now at max with flying
[1:42:25] fooxytv: wow that's gone so quickly
[1:42:25] michaelmm: Pretty easy you need to craft a glider from the kyrian path of ascension or get one off the AH.
[1:42:50] fooxytv: been farming for awhile
[1:42:51] ImperfectDark: yeah you need the Skystrider Glider from the AH. Get a few of em just in case

[1:44:12] Yuri__Sakura: i love your stream good vibes and your stream is intertaning
[1:44:12] fooxytv: need more interviews
[1:44:18] shaypressplay: at least imo
[1:44:46] ImperfectDark: i followed you on Twitch cos you reminded me of a guy that worked in a gas station when i used to buy Red Bull and Vodka

[1:44:53] RosieSeren: I feel bad as its a me problem, but I'm really sensitive to people's voices, someone may be a great streamer but if they have a bad voice I can't handle it, you have a nice soothing voice with a nice stream so its really chill :)
[1:44:59] ltzdawn: i watch your stream every day or put it on at like 6-9am an go to sleep to it, just feels peaceful an something calming to listen to you, which is you mate lol

[1:46:06] Big_Rum: talk*
[1:46:26] michaelmm: For me Audio is more important that visuals with streamers.
[1:46:27] ImperfectDark: good point though. I used to watch Tali a bit but i found he would yell and shout a lot and it  put me off. I mostly listen to Twitch while i work so voices are important :D
[1:46:34] Kubwa7: try falling asleep to Gilbert Godfrey bedtime stories LUL
[1:46:50] Big_Rum: Did you ever see Iron Claw?
[1:47:01] thomssone: I hate screamers and streamers that fight their viewers
[1:47:05] RosieSeren: just that its bad for me lol xD
[1:47:10] michaelmm: High end's a bit different 'cos people watch for the gameplay.
[1:47:30] michaelmm: Casual player's more about the streamer and the vibe.
[1:47:35] thomssone: like asmongold that debates all the time
[1:47:35] MediumRareOG: it varies. it can be funny when a streamer gets one guyed
[1:48:01] BernasPt96: hello quick question can u still farm those weapon skills of worlds of draenor or legion i cant remmember right
[1:48:03] Xara36: what if they're doing the same thing to you?
[1:48:41] rime2: @BernasPt96 challenge mode weapons?
[1:48:53] BernasPt96: yea maybe
[1:49:04] BernasPt96: when u had to farm essence for the weapons
[1:49:19] BernasPt96: yes
[1:49:28] BernasPt96: artifact weapons i wasnt remmebering the name
[1:49:35] BernasPt96: mage towerr etc
[1:49:50] NeeK_23: youre mixing like three things there. Artifact weapons are legion, essences are BFA
[1:50:07] BernasPt96: @NeeK_23 yes im sry m8
[1:50:32] NeeK_23: this achieve is annoying
[1:50:51] BernasPt96: take off some gear?
[1:50:59] NeeK_23: countershot to pull?
[1:51:26] NeeK_23: "im helping" said the monk
[1:51:50] ImperfectDark: oh excellent :D
[1:51:59] BernasPt96: 597 mounts god damn
[1:52:31] MediumRareOG: SL has like 2x the mounts of DF
[1:52:41] BernasPt96: i've always wanted the 2 mounts from firelands
[1:52:53] NeeK_23: SL is stacked, DF looks so small in comparision but you forget the manuscripts
[1:53:45] NeeK_23: they dont count as mounts so I've slacked on them for now
[1:53:50] Pathstrider: which addon is showing the manuscripts?
[1:54:37] FlaminJurr: i need to get back to doing the dragon races. much as they were challenging, one thing ive loved about this expac :D
[1:54:38] NeeK_23: Im too bad at racing to get them all. its frustrating
[1:55:22] HoppsiDejsi: the emreld dreams races are doing my head in.. I just cant get golds o.O

[1:56:26] RosieSeren: yay the party zone
[1:56:41] BernasPt96: if i get the 12 months sub they take the full price right away, what they mean by cancel anytime
[1:56:55] BernasPt96: its like a pause in sub?
[1:57:24] bwoods79: go to the maw, hang out with sylvannas
[1:57:41] NeeK_23: 10.2.6 is pirates since we can sail between regions and cross region is a thing LUL
[1:57:44] PurplePenguinGamer: you can cancel anytime, you just wont be re-billed for an entire year
[1:57:54] michaelmm: @BernasPt96 It's a recurring sub that renews every year untill you cancel it.
[1:58:04] S3N71: Good afternoon MrGM and stream chat.  Happy Wednesday :)
[1:58:09] PurplePenguinGamer: ^^ that
[1:58:13] BernasPt96: @michaelmm ahhh ok
[1:58:15] BernasPt96: ty
[1:58:18] emarol_dk: Maximum said yesterday on stream that the 10.2.6 is awesome.. so he knows
[1:58:24] BernasPt96: makes sense
[1:58:40] emarol_dk: no i dont know how to do that sorry
[1:58:53] bwoods79: It's player housing disguised as pirates, thus not needing dragonflight
[1:58:55] S3N71: ATT SL - good luck :)
[1:59:10] PurplePenguinGamer: spam barrage, and done
[1:59:19] Pathstrider: manuscript journal was indeed the addon, seems im only missing 30
[1:59:19] BernasPt96: u can solo all the difficulties of SL?
[1:59:40] BernasPt96: @Pathstrider Pog
[1:59:43] NeeK_23: yes diff mobs diff wings
[2:00:24] MediumRareOG: Here's an example of how SL is hard to complete. There's a knife in Ardenweald. As a hunter you can use it but it only drops if you're a rogue. There are a few items like that
[2:01:12] BernasPt96: never done this before
[2:01:17] MediumRareOG: AFAIK torghast doesn't count against instance cap
[2:01:18] qaeheh: when you hit instance cap just go to the Maw Kappa
[2:01:22] BernasPt96: yes

[2:02:00] BernasPt96: draenor had something like this before right?
[2:02:00] MediumRareOG: yesterday i went through all th ewings looking for Claustrophic torment. Never hit instance cap
[2:02:06] Jelky55: Dan, hi, out of curiosity, why havent u done this during SL? LUL
[2:02:35] MediumRareOG: BTW the SavedInstances addon is great for telling you how many instances you're at and when the next one frees up
[2:02:49] ImperfectDark: easier to farm older content if you're OP too
[2:03:11] Sery_Bot: The ad break is finishing now! seryboLove
[2:04:13] MediumRareOG: SavedInstances also shows all your lockouts. It's a great addon
[2:04:30] MediumRareOG: Yeah, minimap icon
[2:04:36] Jelky55: i believe its Skoldus Hall shortest, since its Linear, u go straight to end bosses but its been a while
[2:05:05] NeeK_23: yeah minimap and shows loads of customisable info like lockouts and currencies an any alt you have
[2:05:23] Jelky55: one i do hated always is coldheart interstitia, too huge and complicated and mobs used to hurt so much back then
[2:05:44] MediumRareOG: IIRC I farmed Upper Reaches, which I found the easiest and most straightforward. Plus no fearing mobs

[2:06:13] MediumRareOG: No, you still get feared at 70 in Coldheart
[2:06:20] KaisenSiru: KEKW
[2:06:52] S3N71: I've was living the SoD 100% XP and 300% gold boost from Qs this morning.  I'll chill out in DmF this afternoon and do some Comp Stomp
[2:07:20] S3N71: It feels very nice <3
[2:07:58] S3N71: And no more BFD gear inspections and log checks, lol - good XP and some nice gear along the way
[2:08:58] MediumRareOG: torghast tmogs are rng hell
[2:09:06] twin_cloud: I feel like torghast should have given anima for completion
[2:09:38] S3N71: Was the Torghast Twisting Corridors capped?  May run that as well, just to get to the end
[2:10:23] S3N71: Mount sounds good :)
[2:10:27] MediumRareOG: did anyone ever do twisted corridors more than once each layer?
[2:10:52] Harai_Ulfsark: my current task at my job is to hunt private servers info so they get copyright striked, im feeling like a hypocrite KEKWAIT
[2:10:58] S3N71: btw, loved the dynamic ground mount video.  Thank you :)
[2:11:20] MediumRareOG: twisted corridors struck me as something you did once to get the mount then never did again
[2:11:21] S3N71: Do we think it'll be a thing?
[2:12:51] S3N71: They've been doing the ground wrok for sure, if you'll pardon the pun
[2:14:35] S3N71: Bee ta
[2:14:35] michaelmm: beeta I think
[2:14:37] DevoidX: english is beeta
[2:14:37] LuiBMHunter: don't think dynamic ground mounts will take off

[2:19:49] Harai_Ulfsark: VIBE
[2:20:52] MediumRareOG: speed, deaths and completion are all factors
[2:21:03] Harai_Ulfsark: speed and no epic spells
[2:21:10] Sery_Bot: The ad break is finishing now! seryboLove
[2:21:30] michaelmm: There was an addon that estimated the score but it could be a bit innacurate.
[2:21:51] MediumRareOG: @Harai_Ulfsark Oh that's true. No epic anima powers does help
[2:21:54] Harai_Ulfsark: idk someone said that to me way back during shadowlands, we just followed the instructions
[2:22:33] MediumRareOG: i queued into a comp stomp yesterday and immediately won cos it was in progress. that's the best
[2:23:19] Harai_Ulfsark: im almost reaching honor level 80, then i'll unlock all of the pvp artifact appearances
[2:24:06] MediumRareOG: i bought every hunter pvp set from TBC to BFA and I think it cost about 450 marks
[2:25:07] S3N71: I unlocked the first Honour PvP mount from World PvP alone, took a while for sure.
[2:25:49] StreamElements: Check out my Socials! dracJAM  https://twitter.com/MrGMYT https://www.instagram.com/danmrgm https://www.patreon.com/MrGM https://discord.gg/MrGM https://www.youtube.com/c/MrGMYT https://www.tiktok.com/@mrgm_warcraft
[2:26:06] Harai_Ulfsark: i just need 1 vicious saddle to buy the gilneas warhorse, but i cant even farm one seasonal mount KEKW
[2:26:14] michaelmm: I'm hoping the Battleground Solo Queue might make the viscious ones more accessible.
[2:26:22] stoutside: annoying how solo shuffle doesnt count towards the vicious mount unless you go 4-2 or above
[2:27:34] michaelmm: Solo Queue has issues with MMR.
[2:27:52] S3N71: Is the hippo the one that Talie has?
[2:28:07] michaelmm: TL:DR high chance of facing a gladiator even with next to no rating and getting repeatedly globalled by them.
[2:28:17] funviking99: you get 2 saddles btw when completing the thing
[2:28:29] nokster: @MrGM  basically, there should be a passive mmr increase every week on top of the organic one from people playing, but the passive one is bugged for 2 months
[2:28:43] funviking99: yeah
[2:29:15] michaelmm: It's not much fun if you get matched against a multi gladiator player as a low rating player.
[2:29:37] stoutside: i just get elite set by getting 1600 on 2 characters so much less stressful
[2:29:44] michaelmm: They hate it too.
[2:29:47] nokster: no1 knows, since they dont talk
[2:30:08] bwoods79: I feel sad for them for the self found mode, no one playing it. probably not a good idea to release at same time as phase 2 sod
[2:30:10] S3N71: S3N71 is gifting 5 Tier 1 Subs to MrGM's community! They've gifted a total of 226 in the channel! 
[2:30:11] S3N71: S3N71 gifted a Tier 1 sub to japoleon! 
[2:30:11] S3N71: S3N71 gifted a Tier 1 sub to Jose_619! 
[2:30:11] S3N71: S3N71 gifted a Tier 1 sub to gizzle1026! 
[2:30:11] S3N71: S3N71 gifted a Tier 1 sub to munjomba! 
[2:30:11] S3N71: S3N71 gifted a Tier 1 sub to Stewie_6727! 
[2:30:12] michaelmm: As it means they get 0 rating if they win.
[2:30:47] S3N71: Been a while, felt the urge ;-)
[2:30:49] michaelmm: I think the issue with Self found is that most folks already did it using addons.
[2:30:50] stoutside: normally elite set is 1800 but you get a token to buy a set piece from emarald dream x2
[2:30:54] michaelmm: So no novelty factor.
[2:31:22] S3N71: 4 less pints of Guinness for me this weekend, my wife and GP will be very happy
[2:31:49] MediumRareOG: is it my imagination or is conquest gear really expensive?
[2:32:19] MediumRareOG: you get like 100 conquest from a comp stomp and need 700-1800 for 1 conquest piece
[2:32:48] MediumRareOG: idk, i'm not a pvper
[2:33:14] michaelmm: Conquest is really intended as a rated reward so what you get from unrated PvP is a pittance.
[2:33:43] MediumRareOG: @stoutside what token?
[2:34:47] stoutside: @MediumRareOG when you hit 1600 you get a token in your bags
[2:35:17] MediumRareOG: i need 3000 marks to buy all the arsenals LULW
[2:35:26] Harai_Ulfsark: you also get the same token from one of the pve seasonal achievements, dont remember if its 2000 or 2500 rating
[2:35:31] Lausten: mrgmHey mrgmHey mrgmHey
[2:35:53] LuiBMHunter: that's not coffee!
[2:36:03] LuiBMHunter: ohhhh
[2:36:25] MediumRareOG: @michaelmm so how much conquest do you get from arena or rated bgs?
[2:36:31] LuiBMHunter: oh btw paradise peach is not better than dark berry!
[2:36:43] Harai_Ulfsark: i got enough pvp rating last season to get boots, gloves, pants, chest, waist and wrist for the elite pvp set, then i bought the shoulder piece with the token
[2:36:49] MediumRareOG: don't forget to pick up the weekly comp stomp quest
[2:37:16] SinicalDev: didnt realise i could use your coupon even tho im an existing zygor customer from 2022, cheers geezer

[2:40:21] Lausten: Theres a reason its called stomp
[2:40:45] Harai_Ulfsark: its always funny the people in chat that dont know the match is against bots, had someone earlier like "not that i think its bad, but why did we win 6 times already?"
[2:40:49] MediumRareOG: yes
[2:40:53] PommyKing: It is, yes
[2:40:58] Lausten: Hey Pommy bearsa9Wave2

[2:42:03] Harai_Ulfsark: and you can get the darkmoon quest items if you have the adventure guide with you
[2:42:07] MediumRareOG: i've done 50 comp stomps in th elast day and won all 50 so...
[2:42:45] michaelmm: It's embarrasing when you lose a base let alone the whole run!
[2:42:59] MediumRareOG: don't buy wrath pvp sets because they can drop from the vault of archavon
[2:43:03] Harai_Ulfsark: its a good way to get people to start pvp tbh, since its easy to buy a full pvp set during comp stomp
[2:43:18] Phenroi: It IS possible to lose comp stomp, but only if no one is doing anything
[2:44:17] Harai_Ulfsark: that one you dont buy with marks of honor, at least not entirely i think
[2:44:29] MediumRareOG: Wrath PvP sets drop in Vault of Archavon. You'll be able to get those in TWW with the tmog changes if you really care

[2:50:36] exWan: the start screen changed
[2:51:01] Harai_Ulfsark: for who sent you you just need to kill the assassins with the beards that roam the maw, it used to require the assassins that came for you when you had alerted the eye of the jailer, but they added extra npcs bc we of course killed the eye
[2:51:47] Harai_Ulfsark: i think the beastwarrens has a lot of them
[2:51:58] nevermissedwow: Just make a /target macro and spam it while you walk around :)
[2:52:17] Harai_Ulfsark: yeah i camped people that had the eye of the jailer buff and just killed their assassins every time
[2:52:44] Harai_Ulfsark: that too
[2:53:34] Harai_Ulfsark: i think its the blackguards
[2:53:35] nevermissedwow: they're stealthed i think

[3:00:39] Harai_Ulfsark: one of the rings you can only get during necrolord assault
[3:00:57] michaelmm: One item needs a specific assault quest to be up. Can take weeks to find it.
[3:01:04] Harai_Ulfsark: so the other rings are w/e
[3:01:05] PommyKing: That's the stone ring I believe? From the quartered stuff
[3:01:14] Iwony: @michaelmm it was up just last week
[3:01:30] nevermissedwow: do you know about the Bound Shadehound mount? :')
[3:01:46] PommyKing: correct

[3:03:47] angelo_solaris: more to enjoy the warmerish weather finally
[3:03:47] Harai_Ulfsark: i think the farm was worse when it was current, bc everyone was "mining" the stygia clouds, as the only mounts that worked in the maw were the hounds from twisted corridors (hard challenge for most people) the rare hound from beastwarrens (luck drop) or the bound shadehound that was cheap but time consuming
[3:03:51] nevermissedwow: i did it last week xD doing achievs while watching you do achievs atm

[3:51:20] StreamElements: Dynamic GROUND Mounts Coming to World of Warcraft? - https://youtu.be/3eLdJTCnhGg
[3:51:24] exWan: nvm im blind
[3:51:29] MediumRareOG: i wish i could do comp stomp at level 60
[3:52:12] MediumRareOG: first time doing comp stomp. i think i just assumed i could do it at 60. it was probably always max level
[3:52:39] LuiBMHunter: there are OTHER players on your server? ban them!
[3:53:10] death_cam_: hope they add extra ways to lvl alts in TWW such as adding chromie time lvling 70-80 in 11.1 etc
[3:53:24] death_cam_: it gets boring lvling the same way after 10 alts
[3:53:56] MrGM: New Limited Edition Lowkey PC available at https://starforgepc.com/MrGM
[3:53:58] ImperfectDark: are follower dungeons good for leveling from 60-70 now?
[3:54:20] death_cam_: @ImperfectDark still bad from what i tested
[3:54:23] LuiBMHunter: you could do 50 now and more xp but no bonus xp like regular dungeons
[3:54:41] ImperfectDark: @death_cam_ ah pity :( Still better than redoing quests for the 100th time? :D
[3:54:45] SinicalDev: i found it quite slow to complete, slower than a normal dungeon
[3:54:58] death_cam_: best lvling is either the outdoor boost or timewalk spam in tbc/wotlk weeks
[3:54:58] LuiBMHunter: thought you already killed it this week?
[3:55:19] wastedxtime93: Did you catch the video from yesterday on why TWW is shit and some of the new things can't be called new features lmao
[3:55:55] wastedxtime93: Of course, who do you think put it out lmao
[3:56:14] SinicalDev: Iteration is better than a 'new' feature imo
[3:56:16] wastedxtime93: Yessir
[3:56:23] NeeK_23: its an Asmon reaction to some guys video
[3:56:26] Davinah_00: lord it hasnt even been released and people are already complaining
[3:56:56] NeeK_23: wow haters gonna hate
[3:57:04] SinicalDev: the negativity grift gets views unfortunately
[3:57:06] death_cam_: rehashed features bad? ppl been asking them to keep features in rather than xpac exclusive
[3:57:12] Xesol: people do enjoy complaining
[3:57:20] death_cam_: players never happy
[3:57:38] bomayaa: do we have to give him publicity? :(
[3:58:06] ImperfectDark: he was in such a hurry to deliver this quality vid, he had no time to export that pic from photoshop
[3:58:07] death_cam_: i got so mad watching this vid xd
[3:58:14] SinicalDev: budget tuco from BB
[3:58:27] Davinah_00: here is a novel idea...dont buy it lol
[3:58:29] funviking99: @sinicaldev lmao
[3:58:32] ImperfectDark: i'm excited for Delves
[3:58:32] databob1: Sounds like a hater to me
[3:58:51] SinicalDev: SL andy KEKW
[3:59:03] NeeK_23: but like, thats just your opinion bro LuL
[3:59:16] ImperfectDark: he's just so angry, grrr
[3:59:17] michaelmm: It is true that Legion and BfA had more dungeons and raids tho.
[3:59:30] funviking99: oh another guy angry about wow, cringe
[3:59:45] funviking99: here‚Äôs an idea don‚Äôt play it
[3:59:57] Davinah_00: @funviking99 exactly
[4:00:10] michaelmm: Otherwise it's not a fair comparison to compare a nearly complete expansion with a few  announced features so far.
[4:00:14] funviking99: mrgmToast
[4:00:25] NeeK_23: "we want less systems, wow is bad" then now they say" where are the systems??? wow bad"
[4:00:27] SinicalDev: professions revamp will carry on existing, community events will continue
[4:01:24] chelfx: He being yelling in the whole video
[4:01:29] Davinah_00: there is no way that blizz can make everyone happy. i am convinced that the people that hate on it so much are the ones that are looking for the same feelings and awe that they had when they first played. they will always be disappointed
[4:01:34] funviking99: I can barely understand what he‚Äôs saying
[4:01:35] ramzie0: I just hope it's easier to gain profession knowledge going forward.
[4:01:48] HuntingElk: You're dammed if you do and you're dammed if you don't....Can't win either way...
[4:01:50] NeeK_23: we're inside
[4:01:51] exWan: we are inside
[4:01:53] Iwony: at the first boss :D
[4:01:54] Sleepyjoegaming: what ya doing?
[4:01:57] NeeK_23: and we have locks
[4:01:58] Iwony: waiting
[4:02:05] Lausten: He clearly just grew up in a family where you shout
[4:02:06] Iwony: sepulcher
[4:02:17] Davinah_00: @Lausten 100% my family lol
[4:02:23] funviking99: ice cream yay

[4:09:43] Iwony: some went the other way
[4:09:49] databob1: Yum
[4:09:53] HuntingElk: yupp
[4:10:07] HuntingElk: hard coating
[4:11:19] S3N71: We should be able to mount in legacy raids like MC
[4:12:07] Septikknissen: MC is almost so big that you should be able to dragonride inside
[4:12:25] SinicalDev: That better wardrobe addon is cool, you can see outdoor/misc sets
[4:12:38] death_cam_: you dont need to kill it next to the chest
[4:12:45] NeeK_23: i pinged but it was already dying
[4:12:54] death_cam_: you need to kill the big npc with 3 buff stacks from near by mobs
[4:13:12] death_cam_: item it drops from that opens the chest
[4:13:59] HuntingElk: not sure if I read it correctly, but can you set raid/dungeon loot to be all transmog for all to collect??
[4:14:16] Bware2: yeah blacksmithing
[4:14:39] NeeK_23: no greed is there
[4:14:50] StreamElements: dracJAM TWITCH PRIME dracJAM
[4:14:51] death_cam_: greed is there if you alrdy have the mog / cant mog item
[4:14:52] HuntingElk: got it
[4:15:40] Lausten: 4 times and you have skip
[4:15:42] Septikknissen: The bad thing about transmog rolls is that its disabled if you have the same apearance, but the piece that dropped could give you a new one if that gets upgraded
[4:15:49] funviking99: I have the skip
[4:15:52] NeeK_23: 3 more weeks and I'll have it
[4:16:21] death_cam_: i got the sylvanas mount while getting the skips on each alt xd
[4:17:41] iceewater93: friend of mine looted it 2 weeks ago

[4:27:08] WochiTV: @MrGM
[4:27:15] WochiTV: LOL
[4:27:45] WochiTV: techniques
[4:27:50] WochiTV: use of color
[4:27:55] Sleepyjoegaming: got to have a steady hand i would be terible at it
[4:27:56] WochiTV: how to use brushes
[4:28:00] WochiTV: layering of colors
[4:28:01] WochiTV: inks
[4:28:12] WochiTV: lol
[4:28:12] Sleepyjoegaming: @WochiTV wochis going all bob ross on the mini

[4:28:59] HuntingElk: Rod Steward is a Miniature model train builder
[4:29:22] NeeK_23: remember Bolvar
[4:29:25] bomayaa: I thought Elton John was
[4:29:27] Sleepyjoegaming: always loved miniture painting but i would never be able to do it i know my fate haha
[4:29:53] HuntingElk: there was an interview of his build
[4:31:35] Lausten: 50% less dps than last time it seems
[4:31:47] HuntingElk: They got tapped out!
[4:32:20] WochiTV: @Sleepyjoegaming check the ping
[4:34:26] WochiTV: i remember
[4:34:36] WochiTV: that was bad
[4:34:40] WochiTV: 5000ms ping
[4:35:14] wastedxtime93: Lag in general was pretty bad during SLs. World bosses used to lag whole shards when pulled.
[4:35:24] Sleepyjoegaming: what ping sorr?
[4:35:40] wastedxtime93: I agree with most others, simply a date would go a long way.
[4:35:49] volkreig: Definitely appreciated the tweet but think the lack of news stung because it's finally March
[4:36:06] chelfx: well tali did tweet FUUUUU
[4:36:09] NeeK_23: I'll be sad if Holly decided that the experiment was a failure and they wont try it again
[4:36:20] StreamElements: Dynamic GROUND Mounts Coming to World of Warcraft? - https://youtu.be/3eLdJTCnhGg
[4:36:26] wastedxtime93: But they better prepare if 10.2.6 is just another archives types thing.
[4:37:00] volkreig: Personally think they should probably do a compromise instead of all or nothing
[4:37:55] ajryssman: @mrgm what do you think a Nerubian/Azjol-Nerub movie would be like?
[4:38:28] ajryssman: About the War of the Spider and Anub'arak as the lead character?
[4:38:43] volkreig: My most optimistic take is that next week we will know a date for 10.2.6 and end of the month we will know when War Within alpha
[4:38:45] Sleepyjoegaming: !lurk
[4:38:51] chelfx: sounds like it would be low on the list for blizz
[4:38:54] ajryssman: Would the movie trigger arachnophobia?
[4:39:09] funviking99: LUL
[4:39:12] chelfx: yes
[4:39:58] Jack_the_Dipper: Lequid Echo

[4:41:37] ajryssman: An R-rated Revendreth movie?

[5:03:43] SwanWonderland: yes!
[5:04:42] SwanWonderland: I low key miss Shadowlands it was like my first full expansion. i know it's a hot take to like shadowlands lol
[5:04:50] Sawfreak666: next week infos to 10.2.6? U have some idea?
[5:05:12] SwanWonderland: yeaa
[5:05:33] raindelay__: i like how the zones looked in shadowlands. the zones in dragonfligt feel the same to me

[5:06:00] Sawfreak666: and new trtansmog
[5:06:02] SwanWonderland: I'm still waiting on the Pirate flag patch but no clue what it could be exciting to have surprises
[5:06:29] cindarra: come on Blizzard, even just a small bit of info would be awesome
[5:06:48] SwanWonderland: i'm still proging on mythic raid and pushing keys i'm patient <3
[5:07:00] wastedxtime93: Even the mega casuals have to be bored of endlessly runnning superblooms by now.
[5:07:36] SwanWonderland: This week we're proging on Nymue! we got it to 20% so it for sure goes down this week then off to smoldy
[5:07:40] michaelmm: I wonder how much of the issue is that the Emerald Dream open world content was IMO a bit on the shallow side.
[5:07:44] chelfx: Our guild just started doing mythic this tier since we cleared heroic so fast, we got 1 boss down so far
[5:07:53] S3N71: @wastedxtime93 I was bored after getting the bow for 8 straight weeks on my Hunter.  Not been back since
[5:08:16] NeeK_23: needed to be mechagon
[5:08:43] michaelmm: I agree there's a lot to collect but on the gameplay side it feels kinda samey.
[5:08:45] wastedxtime93: @S3N71 that stupid bow drops from literally every weekly bag in the Emerald Dream KEKW
[5:08:46] volkreig: I'm really looking forward to you looking into delves
[5:09:12] wastedxtime93: Gimme that customizable mount pls
[5:09:13] SwanWonderland: I'm still new to Mythic raiding but i really love the new mechanics in it and how fun it can be to work together  to get the boss down. Mythic is like everyone in the raid has more jobs on the team.
[5:09:45] JUTZE: I'm trying to figure out what class I wanna start my completionist journey on. I like hunter but the transmogs for it is just not it imo
[5:09:46] NeeK_23: Dan youre in a mythic raid right now LUL
[5:10:07] chelfx: My friend guild just killed tswift with 420 puls nice
[5:10:14] NeeK_23: mage, for the portals
[5:10:15] SwanWonderland: I love hunter too but we need more transmog options lol

[5:12:10] JUTZE: What class would you have chosen if you didn't choose hunter? @MrGM
[5:12:12] MediumRareOG: i guess i may as well farm the league of aranthor rep with comp stomp

[5:15:20] NeeK_23: big profit, slow sales
[5:16:27] wastedxtime93: I never realized how much gold I was making from Dragon Soul runs on 13 alts a week until I stopped months ago. That like 4k adds up fast af.
[5:17:08] wastedxtime93: I need like 400k to go buy the gold mech suit mount thing from Legion still
[5:17:20] JUTZE: How would you go by getting the stuff like mounts etc that needs a ton of gold? You just going to start farming gold?
[5:17:27] Bware2: yeah.. you have to find maps in disturbed dirt piles hehe

[5:19:42] HuntingElk: Whats funny is when you want to buy from a vender and they want a "Rabbits foot or some shit like that...lol
[5:19:56] wastedxtime93: Only Marvel movie for the whole year, it has to be.
[5:20:16] Sery_Bot: The ad break is finishing now! seryboLove
[5:20:53] gubbyy98: typically how long does it take for beta to start when the client updates? like for cata
[5:21:20] StreamElements: Dynamic GROUND Mounts Coming to World of Warcraft? - https://youtu.be/3eLdJTCnhGg
[5:22:13] bojackhorseman2004: dont get peoples hope up xD
[5:22:15] Scraggersmeh: Are people expecting cata classic beta soon or something?
[5:22:55] gubbyy98: hopefully sooner rather than later because classic content drought is brutal
[5:22:59] bojackhorseman2004: ok, lets do a poll betting
[5:23:43] bojackhorseman2004: Imagine if classic release schedual was the real one from back in the day?
[5:23:53] bojackhorseman2004: i shudder
[5:24:59] gubbyy98: the fact the first phase with kara/gruul/mag was the longest phase was kinda questionable
[5:25:04] funviking99: can‚Äôt believe it‚Äôs been 10 years since wod
[5:25:09] bojackhorseman2004: cata introduced "rotations" and had harder raids
[5:25:12] bojackhorseman2004: so idk how it will go
[5:25:20] bojackhorseman2004: allot of classic guilds might need more time

[5:25:52] bojackhorseman2004: compared to wrath, tbc and classic?
[5:25:55] Shrandamar: Cata killed alot of raiding guilds
[5:26:05] bojackhorseman2004: ofc! those old raids where only hard when they where broken
[5:26:21] bojackhorseman2004: their last itterations are infinitly easier than the last itteration of cata
[5:27:48] bojackhorseman2004: you been saying that since last week
[5:27:55] bojackhorseman2004: eventually you be right
[5:27:55] gubbyy98: do they typically announce news at 6?
