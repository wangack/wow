[9:27:26] alisoninaisle10: Graycen
[9:27:47] emperor_of_kekkind: @RossTheBoss__  To do that you have to be able to eat. Graycen cant even eat 4 chicken nuggets

[9:30:39] TJDoobe_: i‚Äôve been having the most fun playing sod in a long time
[9:30:57] itsBdaws: leveling and finding groups as a solo play sucks I‚Äôm even in a guild but not much different than just using trade chat
[9:31:10] unpeacegamin: why is everyone targeting graycen? are they stream sniping?
[9:31:12] itsBdaws: still having fun otherwise with sod
[9:31:20] GrandmasCloset: you can enable the pvp in STV off talking to the troll guy with floating red crystal

[9:32:53] curv6: shut the fuck up graycen and turn this up
[9:32:55] DuckSmoke_: @Trodenskjold I doubt he even needed to sign a contract, Gray would do that just for fun.
[9:33:19] unpeacegamin: Erm sire did you mean to do that
[9:33:33] Trodenskjold: Dont tell Neon what to do.. jackass
[9:34:01] DuckSmoke_: Graycen is it true all the money your channel makes goes straight into Esfands bank account and he gives you an allowance every month?
[9:34:02] avoidedneXt: sad people are like ugly
[9:34:04] BingoTingler: I just died like 100 to 0 in 3 seconds to an enhance shaman
