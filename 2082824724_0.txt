[0:57:34] beeziex: yeah but you literally built an entire new team and brought them up to be competitive at the top end again, that's huge
[0:58:36] Roadskii: Another thing is that everyone wants to try and create a guild and name for themselves and aren't joining other larger guilds that are established. Almost need to have incentives and a track for advancement in the guilds to make them worthwhile to join.
[0:58:53] Roadskii: I see too many peopel making guilds that just don't succeed
