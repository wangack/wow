[4:44:23] dublincaterlin: you think you will check it out at higher levels
[4:44:24] Qworalmarker: !sod
[4:44:24] Nightbot: Dali will not be playing Season of Discovery. He respects the creative effort that Blizzard is putting into SoD, but a heavily-changed version of Vanilla does not interest him.
[4:44:37] bacconader: whats up after the herbing round?

[4:46:01] kevin_g: stopping dps DIESOFCRINGE
[4:46:25] Tankname: it broke honzi, he gave over Raid leading till cata KEKW
[4:47:32] Tankname: its very feast or famine now, esp with RS, 20 min if oneshot, 2 hours if you are getting mechaniced
[4:47:49] Qworalmarker: sounds like sartharion raid

[4:54:46] MEA_99: i did that once. you have enough time to hearth if it does end up going out in org

[4:56:22] Midiosa: streamer, do you think classic era will survive the launch of shadowlands classic?
[4:56:58] Midiosa: shadowy discovery has a certain ring to it
[4:56:59] burt_nest: i hope cata dies
[4:57:01] WhySoSandy: season of discovering shadows
[4:57:36] nahsorc: why did he delete shadowmourne?
[4:58:01] R_GraM_: cata dies = more ppl on era ofc

[5:00:03] nahsorc: is he going back for cata?
[5:00:11] R_GraM_: agreed. won’t be as hype/population as the others but prob enough to keep it ‘alive’
[5:00:41] burt_nest: what about a F R E S H LUL
[5:01:23] Midiosa: I had to quit SOD because of the MCP changes
[5:01:28] Spencer1234566: have a very tight knit grp of friends that I’m gonna try 10 man’s in cata for tiny bit
[5:01:49] Midiosa: MCP now has unlimited charges but 3 min cd
[5:01:55] Midiosa: so it's a huge nerf for ferals
[5:02:02] Sierraalfa: !alts
[5:02:02] Nightbot: Dalvsali and Pilla are Dali's newest alts on Classic Era. The plan is to ultimately use the warrior as a GDKP alt. The Paladin solely exists to healbot the warrior, no plans to raid on it.
[5:02:13] DatSadBoy: it wasnt on a 3 min icd
[5:02:26] Balruk_: nerf for sweatys a buff for casuals
[5:02:26] dedboitv: automatic crowd pummeler is better in every way
[5:02:28] Uki88: cant chain pop it now
[5:02:31] Midiosa: MCP had no CD.  They have 3 charges that last 30 secs and you can immediately use the next charge as soon as the other one was up
[5:02:35] DatSadBoy: yes
[5:03:02] DhorubaWoW: feral will gain dps in other ways, im sure
[5:03:15] Midiosa: I actually liked the farm haha
[5:03:23] Midiosa: it wasn't bad at all
[5:03:24] DatSadBoy: i mean getting thrash has been datamined
[5:03:25] PermaGrinnn: raid level pummerls inc

[5:04:40] Midiosa: @DatSadBoy I just really loved the MCP playstyle as a tank.  I feel like tanking as a feral has gotten really shafted in SOD so far with the new tanks
[5:04:57] DatSadBoy: @Midiosa yea 100% i get it and agree
[5:05:10] jamesbagster: Sadge
