[2:14:44] RealXrave: kwok?
[2:14:49] FoxiekittenWoW: @rekt1370 i disagree, i think ele is so much stronger than boomie right now, even arcan mage is stronger imo.

[2:16:47] FoxiekittenWoW: @rekt1370 you see 1-2 teams do well with boomie/rogue and then you assume its the best by far? i feel like your logic is kinda flawed here, and you seem very biased for some reason.
[2:16:51] Junkhole903: do u have this seasons glad mount
[2:17:03] bestchaakbestjjang: are you r1 r1 on ladder @cdewx ?

[2:37:33] Lathrien: every dk cd and still dead without link, yep
[2:37:33] xxxmagnifico: lol shell broke the same global he pressed it
[2:37:34] charmsrules: you nearly got hit with the shadowy duel cheese
[2:37:40] charmsrules: right out the gate
[2:38:18] rekt1370: Rmd fun times everything is immortal
[2:38:23] FoxiekittenWoW: @Lathrien but they also used every offenive cd with both trinkets
[2:39:00] zachgamegodx: ya but do they get to wear these cool ass bongos on their back
[2:39:50] infuze27: why he sap and kidney
[2:39:57] RealXrave: missed prime bull rush opportunity
[2:40:29] zachgamegodx: ok kubzy ripping off his es and riptide every time you apply it is gettin obnoxious
[2:40:30] roomi3r3m3dy: GET MAGE ROGUED HAHAHAHAHA
[2:40:40] charmsrules: the cyclone spam classic aye
[2:40:45] charmsrules: you hate to see it
[2:40:46] fatuglystupidbald: they just kill both of ur dps in the same go
[2:40:55] Lathrien: @FoxiekittenWoW It's not about "using every CD," its about the value of the CDs. Collective value of sub offensives (duel, shadowdance, etc) is less value than ams, ibf, and link
[2:41:05] rekt1370: Yea don't think anything beating rmd other than rmd
[2:41:09] RealXrave: dispels?
[2:41:16] itz_killjoy: why is trill a dh? a war would be soo much better
[2:41:17] rekt1370: Maybe rogue boomy can do it too
[2:41:23] JmanOwnz: what dps do you think is best with an h pal in 2s? thinking between dk & war
[2:42:02] RealXrave: @JmanOwnz rogue
[2:42:02] Moobot: Follow me! https://twitter.com/cdew_wow https://www.youtube.com/tenderloinx1
[2:42:23] Yanzoh: ya rogue hpala in 2s  is solid!
[2:42:26] JmanOwnz: @RealXrave - I'm trying to help my cousin learn the game and thought that class might be tough for him
[2:42:38] JmanOwnz: maybe assa is easier to learn?
[2:42:38] RealXrave: maybe dh then
[2:42:50] knappster15: RMP used to kill 1 person in the setup. Now they kill the entire team
[2:42:52] zachgamegodx: dk is good and easy to learn
[2:42:57] FoxiekittenWoW: @Lathrien i think if rogue mage use every offensive in the book and ontop of that both trinkets, i think its fair you go through dks cds. And in general i feel lik that, if two classes use everything they need to be able to kill smt even through one persons defensive.
[2:42:58] RealXrave: yeah but if he wants to play it might not be a bad idea to learn the god class
[2:42:59] zachgamegodx: for the cuzy
[2:43:04] yolohans123: raaaawwgg
[2:43:05] itz_killjoy: dh has darkness, and a stun, while a war has a million peels and tools to save the dk
[2:43:14] JmanOwnz: i really appreciate it and i will try to convince him on that :)

[2:44:41] FoxiekittenWoW: yes @yolohans123
[2:44:50] yolohans123: since when is he playing na
[2:44:55] Yanzoh: well sub is just out right broken to fck, and outlaw is great with certain dps because it has high sustained dmg
[2:45:08] FoxiekittenWoW: maybe 8 months ago @yolohans123
[2:45:16] yolohans123: did he move or smth
[2:45:21] FoxiekittenWoW: nah
[2:45:31] Lathrien: @FoxiekittenWoW First off, it wasn't every sub rogue offensive. He still has two vanishes and a dance charge. Second, mage did nothing besides set up for the rogue.
[2:45:48] itz_killjoy: hes here to spy on na tech
[2:45:55] rekt1370: Rogue and druid together legit can't play the game for a min straight
[2:46:00] MrCrippels: dont you have 2x shadow dance?
[2:46:12] yolohans123: i havent been playing any dragonflight pvp at all. is rogue/mage broken? (again, as always)
[2:46:24] rekt1370: Yea rogue mage broken
[2:46:31] rekt1370: Mainly rogue
[2:46:41] yolohans123: and mage?
[2:46:48] yolohans123: combooost = dead
[2:46:50] rekt1370: Mahe s tier good as always
[2:46:56] itz_killjoy: if rogue and mage are not broken for a patch, a intern gets fired
[2:46:59] yolohans123: liuke...its so stupid
[2:47:07] mayfire15: @yolohans123 fire isn’t even the good spec
[2:47:07] Moobot: Follow me! https://twitter.com/cdew_wow https://www.youtube.com/tenderloinx1
[2:47:12] wyldeshock: wait is my boy a cow?
[2:47:13] yolohans123: @itz_killjoy more like the ceo
[2:47:18] yolohans123: @mayfire15 frost or arcane?
[2:47:23] rekt1370: Arcane
[2:47:25] mayfire15: arcane is the best
[2:47:27] yolohans123: wtf
[2:47:39] yolohans123: arcane hasnt been around for quite some time right
[2:47:46] Lathrien: Mage strong counters certain classes and gets destroyed by others, so def A tier but not S tier like sub
[2:47:55] mayfire15: it’s been good like all dragonflight
[2:48:00] rekt1370: Mage is s tier with a rogue
[2:48:06] FoxiekittenWoW: @Lathrien then you need to go rewatch the game. The mages use arcane surge which is his biggest offensive, rogues uses blades which is his biggest offensive and ontop of that they use both trinkets in the go. If you think ibf and anti magic shield should be enough to live through that i dont know what to say. The game would be so fucking damp if that was the case.
[2:48:17] Lathrien: Anything is s tier with rogue besides warrior and ww maybe
[2:48:20] RealXrave: gg
[2:48:52] sxxicute: that fake on kick to avoid bash from druid was insane
[2:48:57] rekt1370: Only thing s tier with a rogue is mage and boomy
[2:49:04] sxxicute: follow by static totem the roar Pog
[2:49:08] zachgamegodx: you replace that mage with anything else and it’s winnable but when you got that arcane mage stealing the core spells that your spec relies on
[2:49:19] charmsrules: no confidence
[2:49:30] charmsrules: dewFam dewFam
[2:49:34] itz_killjoy: @FoxiekittenWoW i mean rogue can cloak/evasion every specs go, and mage can just block it, so wtf are u saying?
[2:49:37] rekt1370: I want to see rogue boomy vs this dh dk
[2:49:38] buffevoker: Its mvq beat his ass
[2:49:41] riptiedx: is pres jsut better with dh/dk?
[2:49:51] yolohans123: and is rshaman S tier heal rn? or cdew just dreaming?
[2:50:12] rekt1370: Druid s tier
[2:50:22] zachgamegodx: @yolohans123 it’s good, he’s also not dreaming to peel  it
[2:50:27] zachgamegodx: prep
[2:50:31] rekt1370: Think h pally pres are a rest are lower
[2:51:11] MrCrippels: lmaoo

[2:51:13] MrCrippels: holy shit
[2:51:21] Hyutra: I dont play any shamans but how important are earthern shields?
[2:51:37] Yanzoh: very very important
[2:51:38] itz_killjoy: as important as a crack rock to a crack head
[2:51:41] riptiedx: @Hyutra 6% dmg reduction and pretty ngood heals
[2:51:43] YoMamaSoFine69: @yolohans123 no but high a with hpala, rdruid is s-tier
[2:51:52] shamshieldz: pretty important for all specs
[2:52:17] Hyutra: Oh ok cuz I was surprised that he reapplied earthern shields during their go while he was low

[2:52:43] charmsrules: what happended to battle masters

[2:52:51] charmsrules: might’ve helped
[2:54:11] charmsrules: especially when your just getting tunneled and the other 2 are not taking that much damage battlemasters seems really good
[2:54:15] Lathrien: @FoxiekittenWoW I never said ibf and ams should be enough to live. It's the fact that they had to use every defensive with a collective value of 5.5 minutes against 4 minutes' of offensive cds. You keep bringing up trinkets as a red herring.
[2:54:27] Hyutra: Wait so totems can be killed and earthern can be purged isnt playing shamanlike torturing urself? LOL
[2:54:46] nicholas_names: Is the screen partially cut off for anyone else?
[2:54:58] MrCrippels: nope
[2:55:12] itz_killjoy: earthen is a totem, u mean earth shield?

[2:56:32] FoxiekittenWoW: @Lathrien you said every dk defensive and still dead without link. And then i just said, yes they committed every cd in the opener which you dont die as a dk in that situation with only useing shell and ibf i think the game would be dogshit.
[2:58:01] FoxiekittenWoW: @Lathrien cdew didn´t even have earthen down at the time of the go

[2:59:02] dbmx1: is rsham the best for dhdk, or is Druid just best for every comp
[2:59:02] charmsrules: I swear battlemasters is better into the dh dk
[2:59:15] Cybernytez: AWC in less than 2 weeks POGGERS
[2:59:22] Lathrien: @FoxiekittenWoW I'm sure the game would be dogshit for you if sub rogue couldn't 100-0 through pre-wall with bomb and duel. And let's not even count healers that can't use CDs through duel.
[2:59:24] zachgamegodx: nobody uses that dogshit in 2024 @charmsrules
[2:59:25] wyldeshock: my phone freezes every time mes gets hype
[3:00:24] charmsrules: it’s perfect for the dh dk cause he gets straight tunneled all game
[3:00:46] charmsrules: with mes and trill taking almost no damage so why would it not be good
[3:00:50] Lathrien: @FoxiekittenWoW Of course, the game is balanced when sub rogue is countered by you just being better than the other player. That makes sense.
[3:00:54] FoxiekittenWoW: @Lathrien its like you want to miss my point on purpose which if fine. Im not saying rogues are not completely broken, but in that specific situation we are talking about i think it would have been troll if he could live that with only shell and ibf.
[3:01:47] urchinlo: ladies, youre both pretty
[3:02:25] Lathrien: @FoxiekittenWoW He lived that situation because cdew is playing rshaman. If he has a pally or evoker there would be no counterplay besides instantly trinketing just from the threat of duel being usable.
[3:03:51] FoxiekittenWoW: @Lathrien lets just agree to disagree :D

[3:06:55] Lathrien: @FoxiekittenWoW I just think you're fixated on the DK's cds when the whole point is there is no way in that situation that he lives besides Cdew's trinket just from simple math. And when RM gets healer trinket in the first go it's game over no matter what. That's not even counting healers that can't do anything to save you in duel. There is no counterplay.
[3:07:39] FoxiekittenWoW: @Lathrien but cdew doesn´t trinket
[3:07:47] FoxiekittenWoW: he sits the cc
[3:08:27] Lathrien: @FoxiekittenWoW They literally extend the go by kidneying cdew right after he links and get his trinket.
[3:08:32] artagore: Holy fuck lol you are oom or no ? :D
[3:08:32] charmsrules: it’s crazy how long this is going
[3:08:41] charmsrules: with both healers at 0

[3:10:29] Buglifeee: hi cdew
[3:10:31] FoxiekittenWoW: @Lathrien sure i see now, but i mean he has double earthen he doesn´t use they have zone they dont use, they have dark they dont use. They could have played it so differently and also the trinket didn´t end of killinbg them. But anyways i cba discussing it anymore.
[3:11:11] samalycs: how do you get ur mast so high i think im full geared but only 90 %
[3:11:29] Narackgod: @samalycs embelishment
[3:11:36] Narackgod: helps
[3:11:38] samiyam: was the chal good
[3:11:57] samiyam: ofc its ct
[3:12:05] Lathrien: @FoxiekittenWoW When should he use earthen? Just pre-earthen it randomly before combat in hopes they enemy team sucks? Earthen doesn't matter at all. The mage can also just blink knock mes out of earthen anyway.
[3:12:06] Moose31: Whatup Cdew how are you and the Fam doing my guy
[3:12:10] samiyam: y
[3:12:11] samiyam: ya
[3:12:24] samiyam: LOL
[3:12:38] Lathrien: @FoxiekittenWoW Also I didn't see cdew used ascendance either. So 9 minutes of defensives for 4 minutes of offensives. Seems fair.
[3:12:40] samiyam: surprised
[3:12:43] samiyam: cuz he was in a movie recently
[3:12:54] samiyam: bro u didnt see that
[3:12:56] samiyam: he was legit in a movie
[3:12:59] samiyam: with a star

[3:15:48] Lathrien: @FoxiekittenWoW I guess that means you don't have anything to argue about? kEkW
[3:15:54] nomcarver00: @samiyam I don’t think they mentioned when, just that they are making a 3rd season.
[3:16:00] samiyam: damn
[3:16:01] samiyam: 2025
[3:16:04] samiyam: cuz writers strike

[3:17:12] Itankarenas: i get lag after a few hours and need to restart it
[3:18:21] FoxiekittenWoW: @Lathrien as i said i cba to argue you it with you, cuz you obviously think they played it perfectly defensively which is so far from the truth. They greeded so hard which ended up costing them alot more cds than it should have. If we cant even agree on that there is no poiunt in arguing, cuz you are too inexperinced to understand. No flame. xD
[3:19:09] moldybread00: @cdewx they fixed the evoker flying bug
[3:19:13] Bnichoo: is that a new arena, never seen it before
[3:19:27] popzirl: hate that map
[3:19:37] popzirl: as dh
[3:19:39] Lathrien: @FoxiekittenWoW I simply asked you when they should've used earthen since you seem to think it would somehow save mes in the opener.
[3:20:02] antonioorestes1: @cdewx druid isnt a better heal for this comp? (Ps: this is not hate or blame just a quest)
[3:20:02] Moobot: Follow me! https://twitter.com/cdew_wow https://www.youtube.com/tenderloinx1

[3:51:42] groovymitts: @blueberrypieface i just assumed there had to be something i had to craft. idk why id assume differently at this point
[3:52:13] popzirl: @groovymitts there is the craft makes it easier to catch up you can gear in like 2 days
[3:52:15] GnRHDota2: @groovymitts you needed to do some quest at the start of the season for the extra spark, but at the moment you can just pvp
[3:52:15] popzirl: i just did

[3:59:37] bestchaakbestjjang: EU is spamming dhdk @theeyevii so im pretty sure its good
[3:59:40] popzirl: why wouldnt it be viable?
[3:59:55] felgazer: I def think the lower versatility has an effect
[4:00:05] TheEyeVII: cuz rogues destroy dhs, that's why it's not viable
[4:00:28] popzirl: i mean not everyone know how to play rogue
[4:00:34] gracioussatan: if you're in awc you do

[4:15:36] miraclethree: are you snap shotting your dreambreaths for mastery build?
[4:15:41] Garthothewarrior: quick run down of how to play pres evoker
[4:15:49] Sleepiihead: have you run just 2 set and played around with those stats? that’s what I like most on my main evoker. I bet it’s good with this build you’re running
[4:16:21] Itankarenas: you couldn't snapshot dreambreaths if u wanted to in pvp
[4:16:24] Zerolol123: 4 set is insane (i've never played evoker)
[4:16:26] IamWalnuts: vers is only better than haste / mastery when you are getting rotted, most of the time your getting overkilled by a sub rogue so the difference between 30% vers and 20% is nothing
[4:16:30] miraclethree: yeah
[4:16:48] miraclethree: if you go above them in hp it still doesnt get the mastery
[4:16:56] Itankarenas: you use dreambreath when u need the healing. u can't optimize it like that
[4:17:09] miraclethree: fair
[4:18:50] Itankarenas: big commune
[4:18:56] popzirl: p sure you dream breath on cd

[4:22:24] sxxicute: wonder how rdruid is into that? they barely have any purges, and throughput is crazy. doesnt seem to bad on paper

[4:28:30] deathsp1tter: hey cdew, you ever get posture pain from all the sitting for work??

[4:35:43] ohsomagical_: ye very "interesting"
[4:35:54] ashmodean1234: I dont notice much of a difference in presvoker healing though...

[6:52:58] wardelswijk: crit healing i mean
[6:54:09] shiefen: I feel like a lobby where warlock struggles, resto druid is just the healer that makes the warlock the most comfy with when to use port

[6:59:41] Itankarenas: ret demo sounds so weird
[6:59:43] Filippoh94: what does meta mean?
[6:59:45] bestchaakbestjjang: ret demo awc was the worst shit ive ever seen lol
[7:00:13] Filippoh94: chat`?
[7:00:33] Itankarenas: @Filippoh94 top tier with current balancing
[7:00:40] bestchaakbestjjang: the assa rogue sp awc meta into ret demo awc was legit the worst two seasons

[7:01:05] Itankarenas: In essence, a "meta" in gaming terminology is a generally agreed upon strategy by the community. Said strategy is considered to be the most optimal way to win/ has the best performance at a specific task. Some people have defined meta as an acronym meaning “most effective tactics available”. - Google
[7:01:10] svantelorenzo: lovely dog
[7:01:24] Filippoh94: ty
[7:01:43] Filippoh94: what does clepto mean?
[7:01:44] Filippoh94: haha
[7:01:57] wladqz: meta = most effective tactics available, pretty simple :D
[7:01:58] Filippoh94: gonna try google
[7:02:11] dakego: maybe turn your brain off for a while and send some ele q's?
[7:02:22] originalflozzer: Twitch = google, common knowledge
[7:02:27] Eradivyn: it used to be a spell for mages. Might be called "kleptomaniac"
[7:02:37] Eradivyn: pretty sure it was a talent
[7:02:53] svantelorenzo: ez wintrade
[7:02:55] Filippoh94: cuz they steal kills fast or what
[7:03:15] Aro725: no they would spell steal buffs
[7:03:18] Itankarenas: it seems like you always outheal rdruids
[7:03:22] Filippoh94: aah
[7:03:25] Aro725: clepto made you steal all buffs instead of one at a time
[7:03:26] Itankarenas: even if u lose
[7:03:35] Filippoh94: whats commune then haha
[7:03:52] Itankarenas: dude you cant just ask what every word we're saying is.. lol

[7:04:11] Itankarenas: it's emerald communion
[7:04:27] Filippoh94: like healing transfered between players or what
[7:04:34] svantelorenzo: is there any comp that can beat sub rogue in awc?
[7:04:35] Itankarenas: like a giant healing tide totem around the evoker
[7:04:47] Filippoh94: ah ok
[7:04:54] Filippoh94: emerald always is healing lol
[7:05:12] Eradivyn: should i reroll characters, my WR is 44% and i cant seem to have people stay in my group @cdewx

[7:06:24] Filippoh94: yeah retail
[7:06:38] Aro725: you need a like 4 ppl for the blood infusion
[7:06:41] bestchaakbestjjang: at that low of a cr, you should focus on improving your own gameplay first regardless of whether people leave or not
[7:06:41] Aro725: you can solo the rest
[7:06:46] Filippoh94: i mean mostly for the bite thingy
[7:06:50] Aro725: Yep
[7:06:55] Filippoh94: i know u can solo it by logging different characters
[7:06:58] Filippoh94: but im noob
[7:07:01] imRUNOS: isnt living flame heal a lot less in this build?
[7:07:05] Eradivyn: @bestchaakbestjjang how would i do that? practice SS?
[7:07:09] Aro725: Yeah you need a fast computer for that

[7:09:52] bestchaakbestjjang: does my exp matter? @eradivyn . you are already trying to shift blame to others. all i said was focus on your own gameplay. im r1 ss and 3k exp in 3s
[7:10:38] Itankarenas: this doesnt seem like a fun lobby for destro
[7:10:39] Plan: awkward
[7:10:40] bestchaakbestjjang: asking if you should reroll at 2k in 3s just doesnt make sense
[7:10:51] Solushun: LOL
[7:10:57] Itankarenas: just attack everything with a pulse

[7:12:17] Itankarenas: seemed like a premature commune, but im not 2.8k so..
[7:12:18] bestchaakbestjjang: wtf does that even mean @eradivyn ? what is there to doubt and not trust? i literally said focus on your own gameplay first. why would you even think about rerolling at 2000cr.
[7:12:34] Ratkingdomdh: @Eradivyn dont really need a glad or something to tell u to focus on gameplay over what ur number says in 3v3

[7:14:24] bestchaakbestjjang: bleesorc coming in to tilt our boi more
[7:14:43] popzirl: when the round ended death pact was not on cd according to the WA lol
[7:14:45] izza_cat: nah didnt have wall for another 40 seconds
[7:14:46] bestchaakbestjjang: warlock gonna wall on the other team now poggers
[7:14:46] Eradivyn: people in this game are extremely angry like all of the time. holy moly. I'm new but damn. you ask a question and you get punched in the gut lol
[7:14:52] popzirl: maybe it reset idk
[7:15:02] Itankarenas: reset when round ended prob
[7:15:08] Itankarenas: i was like 99% sure he didnt have it
[7:15:16] Ratkingdomdh: @Eradivyn u ask a question that doesnt really have a good answer then need some reassurance an answer u get is "good"
[7:15:19] bleesorc: i couldnt imagine actually qing a healer shuffle lmfao
[7:15:34] Eradivyn: @Ratkingdomdh yeah whats wrong with that? i dont understand
[7:16:04] Eradivyn: its just a question, jeez
[7:16:05] Moobot: Follow me! https://twitter.com/cdew_wow https://www.youtube.com/tenderloinx1
[7:16:19] bestchaakbestjjang: @eradivyn , you are now just trolling. you asked whether you should reroll at 2k cr. i told you focus on your gameplay first because 2kcr 3s is low and you should improve your own gameplay.
[7:16:20] wardelswijk: depends on the setting
[7:16:33] bleesorc: if rogue isnt triple s tier its just not viable and that's the sad truth
[7:16:36] wardelswijk: soloq is not the space to ask questions to teammates
[7:16:41] izza_cat: spellsteal is bullshit too about shroud, imo it should have a cooldown
[7:17:05] Eradivyn: I am 100% not trolling, im new to pvp 3s. relax. No reason to act the way you're acting @bestchaakbestjjang
[7:17:07] Exodius89: i dont think shaman knows tremor removes sleep :)
[7:17:10] Ratkingdomdh: @Eradivyn a bad question
[7:17:29] Itankarenas: Breaking news - AWC champ outheals another evoker in shuffle
[7:17:30] Itankarenas: EZ
[7:17:35] capizzi45: evoker is good to start and learn healer?
[7:17:36] Eradivyn: a bad question for finding ways to improve?? @Ratkingdomdh how else would you expect someone to learn
[7:17:42] rittygander: hey cdew wanna que 2s  Rdruid here around 2k or 2100
[7:17:42] bestchaakbestjjang: you didnt accept my answer and asked me for my exp. what were you going to do if i wasnt r1 ss exp and mglad in 3s.
[7:17:45] Itankarenas: @capizzi45 no lol
[7:17:53] Itankarenas: @capizzi45 probably the worst to start with
[7:17:58] wardelswijk: @Eradivyn if you really want to learn, just play tons of games and watch all available content for ur class
[7:18:03] bestchaakbestjjang: i guarantee you are going to be stuck at that rating with that mindset
[7:18:13] Eradivyn: @BearClips
[7:18:17] popzirl: the worst to start w for sure because you needa go out of position a LOT
[7:18:18] FreddyFerrera: priest is best healer to start with
[7:18:22] FreddyFerrera: and get to know healing
[7:18:32] wardelswijk: no priest is not good at all atm
[7:18:34] Itankarenas: yeah, half the range of other healers makes things way harder if u dont know what ur doing
[7:18:41] wardelswijk: go druid / paladin
[7:18:44] wardelswijk: both are easy
[7:18:44] Itankarenas: disc is a great starter healer
[7:18:52] Itankarenas: it doesnt need to be top tier
[7:18:56] wardelswijk: lol
[7:18:57] Itankarenas: it's good for learning fundamentals
[7:18:58] FreddyFerrera: never said priest was good, just a good starter healer for anyone who havent tried healing
[7:18:58] thebestbrobeans: thebestbrobeans is paying forward the Gift they got from al_capow to the community! 
[7:18:58] thebestbrobeans: thebestbrobeans is gifting 5 Tier 1 Subs to cdewx's community! They've gifted a total of 5 in the channel!

[7:18:59] thebestbrobeans: thebestbrobeans gifted a Tier 1 sub to frankigi718! 
[7:18:59] Eradivyn: @bestchaakbestjjang so trusting a persons information and then verifying whether its true or not will make me stuck at a rating? how do you connect those dots. Seems deeply flawed
[7:19:13] izza_cat: dewFam dewFam dewFam
[7:19:16] wardelswijk: u dont learn shit on low rating
[7:19:20] wardelswijk: dont advice him fucking disc priest
[7:19:23] wardelswijk: its miserable
[7:19:30] bestchaakbestjjang: what part of “improve your own gameplay” needs verification? lmao
[7:19:33] Itankarenas: maybe u dont
[7:19:36] FreddyFerrera: ok man, take it easy bud
[7:20:13] Eradivyn: @bestchaakbestjjang thats not the part you connect, i sought information, verify the information, and then implement. its simple.
[7:20:19] bestchaakbestjjang: i told you to improve your own gameplay and apparently what i told you could somehow be a lie lmao
[7:20:21] Ratkingdomdh: @Eradivyn a monkey could tell you to focus on ur gameplay over what ur rating says
