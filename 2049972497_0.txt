[0:51:37] jokaja: IRL stream! its a great idea

[1:01:36] arlannotness: pulling those puppies and the three packs always feels so sketch to me
[1:01:40] keweeu: YES
[1:01:49] Sebleh: definitely not
[1:01:53] keweeu: Who cares, it would just be fun to watch!
[1:01:53] Sebleh: I agree lmao
[1:02:02] TotallyNotRaien: breathing is for noobs
[1:02:06] Sebleh: the fun thing for chat would be to see what you get to see during the hike.
[1:02:17] Sebleh: you could stream it with music playing and no voice.
[1:02:22] Sebleh: like not speaking
[1:02:33] Aliandramk: go pro on chest instead of head haha
[1:02:39] jokaja: There might also be connection problems
[1:02:42] Sebleh: chat wants to see what outside looks like because we’re just indoors all day Waiting
[1:04:16] keweeu: Damn this is really 2024 "I will find a path with good internet" xD
[1:04:23] keweeu: for a outdoor hike
[1:04:25] Aliandramk: You could probably make some content out of it though, like cut out the boring part and keep fun photos of instects, views etc that you encounter on the road
[1:04:44] jokaja: Or you can make a youtube video out of it, showing just the most interesting things of the trip
[1:04:44] mazzooga: Looking at a Naguura / wow-stream while in a tattoo-shop, letting a heartstone -tattoo on my arm <3 SeemsGood

[1:05:28] keweeu: @Sebleh Wat, it was just meant as a joke :b
[1:05:31] arlannotness: might be better Youtube video content than live stream until you had a chance to figure out your technology limitations
[1:05:41] keweeu: im just terrible at explaning myself haha
[1:06:01] Sebleh: whenever my dad goes downhill mountain biking he puts the GoPro on his helmet and looks down all the way. looks fine tbh but the best part is seeing him look up to eye level and seeing how steep the drops are. he’s got a YouTube channel and his videos are awesome
[1:06:12] fivaldrood: NAGUUUUUUURA!   Good morning.

[1:07:43] Sebleh: if you go hiking by yourself you could make a video of the beautiful views and put some relaxing music over it and not really say much. naguuraSip
[1:08:34] arlannotness: I bet if you look at other simlilar videos already out there you might find inspiration
[1:08:36] Xendera5: When climbing, I only use the iPhone camera for photos even though I have an action cam, but it has been in the drawer for 2 years
[1:08:38] jokaja: You can make it wow quests theme, your quest is to find the key xD but yes, the real time conversations with twitch chat make it more interesting
[1:08:45] Aliandramk: Problem is, here you can read what chat says, while you hike, not sure how that;s gonna work
[1:08:53] markhound: nagura xd
[1:08:57] markhound: FrankerZ
[1:09:04] swaglordYOLOlol: how do you play wow with one hand

[1:11:10] Colt_Engineer: would you say you're working hard or hardly working?
[1:11:11] Sebleh: whenever I go see my friends in Maryland (which actually has weather and places for this) we plan at least 3 days for hiking.
[1:11:52] Colt_Engineer: Sadge
[1:12:12] TotallyNotRaien: you should do a mega reel of all the times you did just after popping your cds
[1:12:12] learningtogrowtogether: @sebleh I miss hiking. health issues took it away from me
[1:12:19] Darty12111: I loved the dungeons in cata :)
[1:12:19] Xendera5: hiking on top of the mountain and after the sunrise snowboarding all the way down
[1:12:29] Colt_Engineer: @TotallyNotRaien I read that as pooping first
[1:12:58] Colt_Engineer: outside is overrated
[1:13:08] TotallyNotRaien: outside is bad
[1:13:09] Colt_Engineer: the graphics are amazing, but the story and gameplay are awful
[1:13:23] TotallyNotRaien: outside has a lot of microtransactions too
[1:13:28] Colt_Engineer: fo sho
[1:13:37] learningtogrowtogether: inside is over rated. outdoors is beautiful and relaxing
[1:13:43] Sebleh: that actually sounds baller tho. hiking up for sunrise and snowboarding or skiing down sounds sick.
[1:13:45] fivaldrood: Next time you come to the states you should do the hike called Angel's Landing.

[1:23:40] Jhazyra: timewalking firelands trinkets, yeah
[1:23:47] Jhazyra: but very few speccs
[1:23:48] Kuroz: I remember people wanting to farm it for day in chat for sure
[1:23:52] Sebleh: last Firelands TW the trinket was extremely OP and it got nerfed like six months ago
[1:24:00] cptdrage: yea but it is nerfed
[1:24:01] Sebleh: and yes it was nerfed after two days
[1:24:09] Sebleh: it’s not worth anymore
[1:24:11] Xendera5: @fivaldrood is angels landing only hiking or is there some climbing passages?
[1:24:28] fivaldrood: @Xendera5 Only hiking.
[1:24:35] Sebleh: it’s heroic raid ilvl IIRC so it would go up to 483?

[1:25:37] Sebleh: I haven’t gone in ages because my shoulder is fucked but rock climbing is so good
[1:25:40] Kuroz: not him
[1:25:40] Sebleh: @tea2468 it is!
[1:25:58] MurtagDev: @tea2468 it is, but your first time is likely going to feel like an arm workout
[1:26:11] tea2468: @Sebleh rip imma be sore for ages
[1:26:27] Sebleh: are you going @tea2468 ?
[1:26:27] ChaosRenown: can you backflip on skis?

[1:27:18] tea2468: first time ever
[1:27:23] arlannotness: A friend I grew up with once owned the tallest indoor climb gym in the world, it was a blast to climb
[1:27:50] frogboioo: oh boy
[1:27:53] ChaosRenown: those are some prime banana bread bananas
[1:27:53] BizBichou: AAAA i hate ripe bananas, they have to be green for me or the texture is wrong naguuraGiggle
[1:27:57] Demosebo: how do you live on Tyra bosses with low vers? bear form all the time?
[1:28:17] Mardokaj: i make banana pancakes...mix banana with 2 eggs and make panacakes out of the mix. Delicious af
[1:28:33] Sebleh: @tea2468 I hope you enjoy it! If you do regular wall climbing you’ll have to learn to belay first but it’s not hard. personally I like bouldering more (no partner needed, weird angles, and you just free drop at the end)
[1:28:35] Tayyun: isn't it interesting that a banana that is getting more brown on the outside contain more sugar than a "greener" banana
[1:28:49] Sebleh: last time I went bouldering I almost got fully horizontal. shit was terrifying naguuraGiggle
[1:28:53] ppdxd: didnt know boomies eat bananas Hmm
[1:28:55] Hemenia: ok naguura tell me, am about to get my boomkin up and running again, are there fights like Raszageth this tier or is the spec actually playable?
[1:29:19] Hemenia: everyone does idk why
[1:29:31] SenseiEaos: I blame Hermine
[1:29:38] Sebleh: @hemenia there is one fight that is not like raszageth

[1:29:51] StreamElements: For Highlights, fun content and guides, remember to subscribe to my youtube channel -> https://www.youtube.com/naguura
[1:30:24] Sebleh: She’s exaggerating. It’s bad but it’s playable. it’s much better than it was in vault
[1:31:19] IAmJoey: moonkin is very defensive you just lose 80% damage for 5 seconds
[1:31:32] kaverrr: A Moonkin would never gaslight you to believe they suck. Trust me.
[1:31:35] kaztier: @Naguura I'm so sad my account was hacked and I was able to get it back but now cause the hackers did something its perma banned i have never done anything agianst tos ever Sadge
[1:31:41] Hemenia: Am curious how you'd argue in that sense lmao
[1:31:46] Sebleh: “you can play it but you’re not gonna like it” so you’re saying it’s playable Waiting
[1:32:08] IAmJoey: aren't moonkins always dooming every season
[1:32:11] Sebleh: @kaztier put a ticket in and explain the hack. Maybe you can get access back.
[1:32:12] Hemenia: isn't the tier good? I liked it on ptr
[1:32:23] cptdrage: just give moonkin the armor back so we dont have to go bear all the time
[1:32:26] Anisava: Anisava subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 3 months, currently on a 3 month streak! tersteLo
[1:32:28] Hisham7g: yes, they are bad atm, I used to play it since 2015
[1:32:34] Kuroz: naguuraLove naguuraLove naguuraLove
[1:32:56] Hisham7g: they kinda fun to play but not competitive
[1:33:03] ellythetrekkie: There is one fight I like to play as moonkin and that's mostly it 😅
[1:33:07] Hemenia: I'll obviously play it regardless
[1:33:14] kaztier: Sebleh i did but its been 24hrs radio silence idk what to do i have put a ticket in the email explaining the ban says they wont overturn it
[1:33:21] ellythetrekkie: Yeee lol
[1:33:30] IAmJoey: dots + starfall go brr
[1:33:30] Hemenia: Also keep in mind I won't be fighting for a raid spot, it will be farm so mostly m+
[1:34:09] Sebleh: @kaztier my only suggestion would be to keep putting tickets and asking politely and nicely (no sass no passive aggression) until you get a positive response or they tell you to stop
[1:34:10] Hemenia: i ask if they're doing something weird
[1:34:21] itsClubby: Jamgie in case you havent noticed
[1:34:29] IAmJoey: if you are a class with invis you never really have to look at the route
[1:34:35] ellythetrekkie: Some guy in a 22 was DEMANDING the tank link their darkheart route
[1:34:37] IAmJoey: since you dont have to save pot

[2:19:34] TearizGaming: 4 dps poggg
[2:19:34] segarth: no DH, very interesting
[2:19:40] segarth: DH dps i mean
[2:19:45] Sebleh: there’s def enough variety this time plus VDH
[2:19:51] StreamElements: For Highlights, fun content and guides, remember to subscribe to my youtube channel -> https://www.youtube.com/naguura
[2:20:06] tea2468: no boomkins :(
[2:20:14] tea2468: BibleThump
[2:20:14] Sebleh: there’s one more
[2:20:30] Sebleh: oh it’s the same team nvm just with a hunter
[2:20:45] Sebleh: my stream is too blurry to read the names.
[2:21:04] Ekyso: do you expect moonkins to show up in high keys?
[2:21:08] ChaosRenown: moonkin sucks in low keys and dies in high keys KEKW
[2:21:18] tea2468: some don't have augs
[2:21:22] tea2468: either
[2:21:28] Sebleh: so time trials can be done with no healer, but do they have to run one for the actual MDI?
[2:21:35] tea2468: @ChaosRenown LOL tru
[2:21:36] Sebleh: like in terms of the rules
[2:21:38] astreinoid: shadowbuff and instant PI mage buffbot
[2:22:06] That_Nif: last finals it was 24-25 keys no this time the key start is two higher
[2:22:17] Ignite_CLO: tobo is a full time main healer in echo now
[2:22:33] Sebleh: yeah but this season the key inflation is like 3-4 levels @that_nif
[2:22:54] Sebleh: and that’s without an OP Aug too

[2:23:57] segarth: i wonder how "last minute" shadow priest was decided worth bringing, with the recent buffs
[2:24:18] Sebleh: probably very last minute
[2:24:29] Ignite_CLO: true and real https://clips.twitch.tv/GrotesqueGrotesqueOilTebowing-uTYVU4E9cW6Tuykj
[2:24:36] segarth: warlock is strong all throughout imo
[2:24:48] lostcol0ny: Yeah, demo especially has felt really good in keys
[2:24:51] StreamElements: For Highlights, fun content and guides, remember to subscribe to my youtube channel -> https://www.youtube.com/naguura
[2:24:53] ChaosRenown: warlock is still strong on low keys because doom brand pops on death
[2:25:10] cptdrage: they gotstunpet dispellpet etc comes out quite handy and no aoe cap

[2:25:22] Sabretoofs: their survivbility is insane
[2:25:22] Hunter__Thie: they are unkillable
[2:25:26] Stinth: if you have mage you'd want 3rd dps to be a caster as well probably since you have vdh already
[2:25:26] Ekyso: destro warlock is uncapped
[2:25:34] tea2468: does that matter as much in low keys tho?
[2:25:34] Sebleh: what dungeon is that with all the warlocks?
[2:25:35] tea2468: yeah
[2:25:35] tomo65041: summoning stone
[2:25:45] lostcol0ny: lol yeah, we give healthstones too
[2:25:48] tea2468: maybe lock gate?
[2:25:49] just_ie: cataclysm builds for insane resets of portal
[2:25:49] Sebleh: @tomo65041 true plus they have a hot pet. that’s 100% it.
[2:25:59] Hunter__Thie: is this training for mdi what your are looking at ?
[2:26:00] Sabretoofs: battle rez?
[2:26:01] lostcol0ny: What are we considering as low keys here?
[2:26:04] Ignite_CLO: gotta be the healthstone Kappa
[2:26:08] drdrozd12: health stones instead of healer
[2:26:28] Ekyso: EB has 2 gate skips, so they will always run 1 warlock there in MDI
[2:26:37] Hunter__Thie: prob insane dmg+so many stuns as destruction
[2:26:50] Sebleh: tyrannical rise with all the locks must be insane ST because there’s no trash in that dungeon.
[2:27:08] That_Nif: @Sebleh I'm aware, that got me thinking that we'd see around 27-28's towards the end and that might shake up some of the comps compared to what we see here at the start.
[2:27:17] Sebleh: and fort ever bloom the opposite. must be different builds for either insane ST or AoE
[2:27:21] esceti95: i dont think there is any good gate skips this season ?
[2:27:29] Stinth: If you have DH, Druid, Mage and Priest it makes sense that lock is the best. Magic dmg, benefits from int, what else would you slot here?
[2:27:31] logain_13: Good single target and AOE with the same build, and doom brand summons the fiend when a mob dies, doesn't have to tick out
[2:27:32] segarth: ein apfel?
[2:27:33] Ekyso: You can save around 1min with gateskips in EB, and since destro warlock is uncapped is literally the best dps in EB atm
[2:28:05] TearizGaming: Shocked there isn't more rets after their buffs and the leggo
[2:28:26] Sabretoofs: why druid though?
[2:28:27] ChaosRenown: @logain_13 this
[2:28:28] cptdrage: loads of aoe stuns
[2:28:31] Sabretoofs: for healer
[2:28:41] Wupday: what dungeon?
[2:28:43] tea2468: I dont know enough about warlock tbh
[2:28:45] Sebleh: the no healer comps are def using lock cookies as a bonus.
[2:28:48] just_ie: Its probably just cause of its sheer mass AoE damage around Cataclysm immolates aand portal resets
[2:28:59] Sebleh: or
[2:29:02] cptdrage: just ask sjele
[2:29:14] tea2468: do they get a huge buff with PI?
[2:29:15] Stinth: Mage is best lust, Spriest is best pi, Rdruid is best buff healer, vdh is best cc and best buff tank, that's my thinking anyway
[2:29:20] Ignite_CLO: there is a ret though
[2:29:21] Ekyso: I wonder if we are gonna see full melee comp like war dps and stuffz
[2:29:24] Hunter__Thie: cause ranged>>>melee
[2:29:31] Hunter__Thie: ranged has no down time
[2:29:33] ChaosRenown: @tea2468 nah its just natty damage
[2:29:34] Sebleh: raider io logs the key as what spec you are when you start the key (per the blizz leaderboards) who’s to say they’re not swapping to a healer at the start and it’s not no healer comps PepeLaugh
[2:29:48] kj01a: ho w dare you
[2:29:50] harz_wild: pi is for pussys xD

[2:30:05] Luk777ls: why the resto druid
[2:30:12] Luk777ls: and no priest
[2:30:15] cptdrage: many grps without healer
[2:30:19] Stinth: is there any dps that does more dmg than spriest + pi dmg Hmm
[2:30:25] TheGame402: @Luk777ls highest dps
[2:30:37] logain_13: @logain_13 I'm wrong. I hadn't clicked through. They are playing destro not demo
[2:30:43] Ekyso: Warlock that are uncapped blast in normal keys where pulls are average and safe, they scale as the pull gets bigger and in MDI pulls they go giga
[2:30:44] Sabretoofs: yeah MOTW is sick
[2:30:45] Rancidius: druid is goated
[2:30:45] kj01a: they are high keys to some of us NotLikeThis
[2:30:47] harz_wild: i playing since legion affli warlock .. and iam fucked up for 3 addons
[2:30:47] segarth: are they all playing dwarves? can you even check race there? or no
[2:30:52] drdrozd12: resto druid is just really good right now in m+
[2:31:00] segarth: all the dps i mean, the casters
[2:31:04] shortspells: which spec are all these warlocks?
[2:31:07] Leredi: when the last time you have seen a hunter in mdi
[2:31:20] wicked_baboon: sl

[2:31:55] harz_wild: ich hab mich damit bgefunden das niemand uns afflis mag
[2:31:58] Sebleh: the key levels for MDI are def low enough to not have the “just bear form” issue so any spec can probably be fine without the survivability issues. it’s just a damage thing at this level
[2:32:02] Ekyso: It is still broken what do you mean? I heard surv hunter r1 right now is pumping Hhhehehe

[2:35:48] Zapzoda: do you have to prot pally if you do no healer
[2:35:56] Ignite_CLO: am i crazy or wasnt there a only 5 tries that count kinda rule for the time trials ?
[2:36:23] drdrozd12: just bring a prot pally instead of healer
[2:36:28] Ignite_CLO: ok i must have misremembered
[2:36:49] esceti95: one day we will get warrior in mdi DPS
[2:36:52] Stinth: @connExpertise it was indeed that way back in the day, you had practice keys and "for real" keys on TR
[2:37:19] papafigs84: what is that addon btw?
[2:37:23] nemzky: BFA had like only prot warriors
[2:37:26] Kuroz: !groups

[2:37:33] Ignite_CLO: @Stinth truee thats how it was
[2:37:42] esceti95: i only stayred playing wow in DF so
[2:37:44] harz_wild: season warri  1 tank was nice like a stone !
[2:38:00] harz_wild: best time of my life xD
[2:38:04] turbsow: I want devastation evoker to be meta, pleeeease, fun spec!
[2:38:08] drdrozd12: ´pretty much every healer spec has been played i think
[2:38:11] drdrozd12: before
[2:38:23] Ekyso: I really miss the days where key level pushing was based on tank surviving and not dps output :(
[2:38:29] Sebleh: resto sham hasn’t seen MDI time
[2:38:33] Sebleh: only tgp iirc
[2:38:58] itsmagyks: it's also not currently based around dps output lmao
[2:38:58] harz_wild: ach wir tanks heulen alle rum ...
[2:39:01] annettebrr: what? lol that sounds bad
[2:39:02] Sebleh: I think SL S1 was tank survival no? shit just hit way too hard?
[2:39:25] ChaosRenown: we found the tank player in chat KEKW
[2:39:37] turbsow: what do u think about devastation evoker? @Naguura
[2:39:39] Ignite_CLO: how is that desirable anyways.. tanks not being able to survive gotta be the lamest reason why you cant time a key
[2:39:41] turbsow: fun/good?
[2:39:41] harz_wild: aber der song kommt gut :)
[2:39:51] StreamElements: For Highlights, fun content and guides, remember to subscribe to my youtube channel -> https://www.youtube.com/naguura
[2:40:01] Raerdk: @Sebleh s1 dragonflight
[2:40:33] Ekyso: Well, if you wanna play with an evoker on tyra high keys, you must have 2 giga blast classes like boomkin and mage uncapped, cuz if you take 2 other classes that are capped and low on dps, they will also bring the evoker overall output down. Thats why most high keys rn are kind of the same comp
[2:40:36] Sebleh: maybe it was threat in SL S1 naguuraNotes
[2:40:37] Ignite_CLO: does that person at the top of 3855 score D:
[2:40:47] MisterNioce: As a dev main.... ouch
[2:40:53] Faramonde: Yea, Preheat and Viridian are massive assholes!
[2:40:53] JohnAllenCasts: Can't believe you continue to chat shit about devoker
[2:40:55] JohnAllenCasts: sadge
[2:41:12] Sebleh: she’s toxic @johnallencasts can’t expect anything less tbf NOTED
[2:41:15] arlannotness: any thoughts on why they chose to stop increasing keys past 23 in the time trials?
[2:41:33] Sierrakilo96: so you dont like ret as well :D
[2:41:53] Ignite_CLO: i sense some aoe burst envy here Kappa
[2:41:56] TheGame402: elitist streamer take Kappa
[2:41:58] TotallyNotRaien: very rational
[2:42:01] Cyberkaia_: @arlannotness theres no need, MDI its push faster, not higher
[2:42:02] Sebleh: @arlannotness because the competition is fastest low key run not highest push
[2:42:13] JohnAllenCasts: Unbelievable. Unsubbed. Unfollowed.
[2:42:30] Ignite_CLO: HOLD DMG I GOTTA ALLIGN THE SUN AND THE MOON FIRST KEKW
[2:42:32] JohnAllenCasts: It's like a spider sense
[2:43:09] arlannotness: I know the format but that could be achieved at higher levels as well so why stop at that level is my question
[2:43:28] Ignite_CLO: new justin timberlake song is really good
[2:43:55] Nrage_24: Evening Caro. took me a minute to work out that's your knee...LOL
[2:44:07] Ekyso: Dont you think 23 is too low for this season though?
[2:44:19] Sebleh: I am excited to see what batshit insane strats Echo will whip out YEP
[2:44:36] yiannisjk: apply to our 28 atal
[2:44:42] jentoruu: 23 ez 4man xd
[2:44:42] Kuroz: they always start at 7-8 levels below the highest keys pretty sure
[2:44:42] TheGame402: Keys will be higher later in the tournament
[2:44:44] Daniito_KoC: 23 isnt impressive at all
[2:44:49] Kuroz: I dodn't remember higher keys
[2:44:50] TheGame402: Key levels went up last MDI
[2:44:51] LtJenkins: Yeah he's bringing sexy back...again
[2:44:51] StreamElements: For Highlights, fun content and guides, remember to subscribe to my youtube channel -> https://www.youtube.com/naguura
[2:44:52] Daniito_KoC: bit disappointing
[2:44:53] yungbooma: yeah lets speedrun a 27
[2:44:54] Luk777ls: time trial is 23 so actuall keys wil be 24.25
[2:45:01] Luk777ls: *24-25
[2:45:03] cptdrage: have u checked trading post?
[2:45:07] Tanzaii: !s3
[2:45:07] StreamElements: Is damage in M+ too high ? -> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmdb5KZLBhk
[2:45:13] Sebleh: imagine having a group for the banners seblehDepresso
[2:45:14] Ignite_CLO: a 23 key isnt impressive no .. a 11 minute 23 key is though
[2:45:18] arlannotness: you get the banner just doing a 15 though
[2:45:19] Sebleh: @cptdrage she doesn’t care about the trading post

[2:45:32] sigmalios: 3 pulls dungeons that is the fun of mdi
[2:45:39] yungbooma: you cant pull the whole dungeon in a 25
[2:45:49] arlannotness: I'm just curious on thoughts, I actually am doing it for the first time myself it has been fun
[2:46:02] JohnAllenCasts: They could do something crazy like run devestation evoker in 23
[2:46:06] Daniito_KoC: will mdi be shown on twitch?
[2:46:12] Kuroz: it will
[2:46:20] arlannotness: Very different but interesting format
[2:46:24] Cyberkaia_: MDI Swap team no healer KEKW
[2:46:33] y0rge: in my opinion 23 is to low cus no one cares if they pull hafl of the dung in 1 pull
[2:46:37] cptdrage: |sweet mount on trading post <3
[2:46:53] Cyberkaia_: @y0rge waht? all i want from MDI its to pull the whole dungeon
[2:46:57] goldfishie1: rip i got an add. but i do prefer TGP over the MDI, watching MDI reminds me that CMs are no longer here and that makes me sad
[2:46:59] ppdxd: im literally in tool simulator with similar rio as you, boomie as well, lets see who gets inv first Businessge
[2:47:05] Cyberkaia_: thats what i expect from MDI, pull the whole F dungeon
[2:47:24] arlannotness: Ya our team was thinking through ways they did it.
[2:47:41] jeybee93: Can you watch time trials?
[2:47:45] JohnAllenCasts: MDI is so much more fun from a spectator pov imo
[2:47:57] Kuroz: @jeybee93 top teams don't stream time triaols
[2:47:57] Cyberkaia_: @JohnAllenCasts Big pipi pulls
[2:48:00] Kuroz: trials*
[2:48:09] JohnAllenCasts: unless you're super invested in TGP scene which is essentially just watching people run keys
[2:48:13] drdrozd12: i wish i was deaf now
[2:48:18] Sebleh: you can if people stream it
[2:48:18] thetankwithingg: MDI is pure adrenaline and energy, in TGP you can restart the key after first pull. MDI is only one chance
[2:48:26] arlannotness: It was fun we spent maybe an hour and half last night doing runs. It was fun.
[2:49:27] Ekyso: My concern would be the keys to be way too low in actual MDI to the point where teams will 95% of the time not wipe and the result will be due to timer.
[2:49:51] StreamElements: For Highlights, fun content and guides, remember to subscribe to my youtube channel -> https://www.youtube.com/naguura
[2:49:55] Feskekongen: When does the live MDI show star?
[2:49:57] JohnAllenCasts: as long as it's outside the augvoker sweet spot range
[2:50:00] TheGame402: @Naguura Didn't S1 MDI have multiple key levels up to 23/24 and started at 21
[2:50:02] Kuroz: @Feskekongen 16th
[2:50:02] nofairei: @Ekyso Smart take, didnt expect anything else
[2:50:18] TheGame402: that sounds like a good thing, who wants a one sided game
[2:50:19] Kuroz: timer is more exciting
[2:50:26] Kuroz: than a match over on pull one
[2:50:26] Kruxiik: Do you ever want to play a different class? How do you stay disciplined to one class only?
[2:50:34] k1ss33: Do you need 2 dps rawr
[2:50:34] segarth: yah, wiping is boring cuz then the other team just takes it safe and wins
[2:50:37] Ekyso: Well yeah, but if both teams wipe, that makes it even more exciting
[2:50:47] Ekyso: or come back stories, one team wiped and is behind, and the other wipes as well at the end
[2:50:51] Stalkeros: Hello, is here some discount for Corsair? :)
[2:51:00] ChaosRenown: @Kruxiik brain damage
[2:51:00] JohnAllenCasts: Imagine two teams are racing right at the end. You know they're both finishing but they're within 10 seconds of eachother so it's on the really small stuff which makes it higher pressure
[2:51:00] Sebleh: what do you think if MDI allowed one dungeon restart per match without a timer reset? like one team can restart their dungeon without resetting their timer.
[2:51:08] Kuroz: no discount @Stalkeros
[2:51:12] k1ss33: Do you need 2 dps rawr
[2:51:32] Kuroz: stream is fine
[2:51:33] Ekyso: @Ekyso kekw, yo nofair
[2:51:34] drdrozd12: that fiesta junkyard from bfa is still the greatest mdi momnet ever
[2:51:35] bayhie: i wanna see +31s and i wanna see some guilds fail
[2:51:52] IAmJoey: @bayhie that is the great push
[2:51:55] TheGame402: @bayhie MDI is not about pushing high keys, thats TGP
[2:52:06] bayhie: oh sorry then im new
[2:52:34] TheGame402: @bayhie MDI is a 1 vs. 1 against the timer, the team that finishes 2 of 3 dungeons faster than the other wins
[2:52:45] Cyberkaia_: @drdrozd12 Best moment of MDI was Naowh missing % on finals
