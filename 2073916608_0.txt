[0:51:50] Faithdimmer: @Kelltic As a 53 year old hard core casual since vanilla I would tell you BM hunter, learn to kite to avoid damage and use defensives only when you can't escape, damage is not hard either

[0:53:13] endtrip_: hitting 1000 buttons isnt fun
[0:53:27] p0rtium: when you reach max level in the newest expansion do you just grind honor gear then conquest never doing pve?
[0:53:29] kevogasm: That was good
[0:53:53] averagenjoyerrrr: @xRHythmsx bro read the comments in chat KEKW people saying they havnt palyed in months then insta get 2300 LULW its the easiest class in wow
