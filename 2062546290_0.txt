[0:11:20] Pups_Gersky: Joy, another 2 hour maintenance this morning..
[0:11:46] Verdell263: Live Maintenance
[0:11:49] SuperLost89: @Pups_Gersky its a live one, so the servers will still be on
[0:12:05] TouchMyCream: reach arounds count as blizzard services, watch out for the ban
[0:14:44] ninetynil: towHAMUP
[0:15:10] Shrenko: GLORIAAAA !!!
[0:17:22] Pups_Gersky: So the whole thing with retail gold to Classic gold, its not against TOS, its at your own risk. If you are found to RMT they will ban you. ONLY use a trusting source, ie friends/family/etc. However I am not sure what the going rate is gold for gold so that will take some research. There are discords out there that do offer this service.
[0:18:43] metavahn231: just got the paladin 2hander from the pvp event, never doing that again lul
[0:19:18] Pups_Gersky: I have 6 more events to do to get my bow and quiver.

[0:24:05] Pups_Gersky: People are saying that the token change could be a bug.
[0:24:12] pandosul: so we cant change them for account balance anymore?
[0:25:21] rbolude: the description of the token is changed, it makes me think its not a bug, but no one knows yet
[0:26:32] pandosul: well this is a blow for many players
[0:26:50] pandosul: they will lose a lots of them

[1:16:55] Rottencoarse: :D
[1:17:10] im_capy: @Noobicron ya, shows im subbed for 14 but only followed since Sept of 2023. They messed it up awhile back a few times
[1:17:18] Rottencoarse: @MrChillGates  whats the maintance for?
[1:17:22] ice_from_fire: bro ive been following towelliee since legion holy shit
[1:17:32] TheItalianStallion321: $65 for a mount seems like a bargain to me
[1:17:40] Noobicron: i think my kids always following and unfollowing people lol
[1:17:41] AzedaNA: I feel sorry for the D4 devs. They need to change out that entire "decision" team pulling the strings
[1:17:59] DrkPhoenix6913: i mean, it's mostly the platinum cost - but it's shitty to combine it
[1:18:13] im_capy: Ya, the mount is "free" and the currency you are buying, BUt it looks horrible given the timing
[1:18:21] MrChillGates: @Rottencoarse Idk, but I got randomly disconnected with everyone else earlier. I think a glitch
[1:18:24] Alaquane: New activision boss is there to make money
[1:18:33] AzedaNA: I just don't think there is enough on the shop to justify the constant need/want for Platinum
[1:18:35] danieldg03: I saw the title: "Happy Kleenex day" and i came right away.
[1:18:39] danieldg03: Jajaja
[1:18:55] Shrenko: 65 is insane
[1:19:01] medanmarko: Semi upset? :D
[1:19:05] Noobicron: should be a mount and 700 plat for FREE, and even then i wouldnt play
[1:19:08] im_capy: The ingame Tmog is just soooo bad compared to the shop, like I get it to a degree, but D4 does it to whole other level
[1:19:10] TheItalianStallion321: if that mount has storage, an occolust, a blacksmith, an alchemist in it. maybe its worth
[1:19:21] JuiceBoxDrizzle: Thought this was supposed to be a live maint?
[1:19:23] Todmeister9000: whales will probably buy it
[1:19:34] AzedaNA: I think the D4 community team and dev team are good, but whoever they report to is just clueless
[1:19:39] Alaquane: someone looked at Warframe and copied their homework a little too close
[1:19:45] MrChillGates: I just want the auctionhouse mount
[1:20:07] swervity82: welcome to microsoft

[1:20:32] MrChillGates: If they told us.... They would have to kill us
[1:20:37] JuiceBoxDrizzle: Lol for real, it even says "Should be able to log back in" Saying "Should" doesn't sound very for certain
[1:20:43] PotbellyGoat: they buffed the unique drop rate in open world and it still amounts to more hours played to see one that anyone will get within a season
[1:20:44] byrdeen45: time for last epoch
[1:20:50] ice_from_fire: i think you were the first wow streamer i ever followed

[1:58:54] sup3rsonix: shadow word deaht hits for 1k
[1:58:55] TheItalianStallion321: @Rhea_the_Cat yeah, i guess. so it works out in our favor more than them i suppose
[1:59:11] BlindsydeGaming: Multi-dot into Mind Spike into Mind Blast. Snipe finishing hits with Shadow Word Death. Support heal with Vampiric Embrace

[1:59:27] Calibur84: If they don't die
[1:59:27] sup3rsonix: 50% unless they die
[1:59:30] aspiration89: If it kills them it doesn't damage you
[1:59:35] BlindsydeGaming: You only take damage if the enemy survives, but its 50% of the damage normally
[1:59:45] wEiRdO_dUdE: If it doesn't kill them then you take damage, but the people usually die
[1:59:49] TheItalianStallion321: @Rhea_the_Cat lol again, wishful thinking on my part
[1:59:56] bobtar121: NA servers are spinning up!
[2:00:17] MrChillGates: its great for breaking sheeps

[2:03:09] Merkkinz: there are gray items listed for like hundreds of gold
[2:03:20] NineThree: aren't they just listing white items in the AH for like 50+g? i thought that's how they were doing it.

[2:06:57] Kaykerrs: wtf why are they doing another maintenance lol
[2:07:13] MattyNiceTV: my guild is also having issues with getting ranged to want to raid lol. We had 2 hunters and the rest that were 40 were melee.
[2:07:15] firehawk73: he know people
[2:07:15] Vesidian: #streamerprivledge
[2:07:16] TheItalianStallion321: @Kaykerrs it was supposed to be "live" maintenance

[2:08:07] TheItalianStallion321: pathetic
[2:08:09] Verdell263: LUL
[2:08:17] Kaykerrs: I don't agree with that @Calibur84
[2:08:21] Merkkinz: il my balance
[2:08:22] MattyNiceTV: I am our main tank but I am now leveling a mage and told melee to get some tank gear or level a ranged so we can raid
[2:08:32] plumpus81: elemental, not enhance

[2:08:36] PigPenLen: pally in the middle smh
[2:08:40] DigiD702: My group was 33rd in clearing gnomer on Living Flame
[2:08:47] bobbyhennings: Got smoked by many many melee hunters in STV, makes sense now lol
[2:08:50] Molvonos: And Fire Warlock's as high as it is because Fire Mages run the Scorch talent, increasing fire damage by 10%
[2:08:51] Raidr211: damn boomkins up there
[2:08:58] Verdell263: Scroll down
[2:09:00] Molvonos: While able to get mana back way easier.

[2:09:49] MattyNiceTV: no having to conserve mana
[2:09:51] wEiRdO_dUdE: Yeah now we see why the world first people used 2 warlock tanks
[2:09:59] TheItalianStallion321: look that dot with arcane mages. it was so far ahead
[2:10:00] Choocharoo: I didnt even see BM hunter actually using a bow/gun listed
[2:10:01] TheItalianStallion321: wtf

[2:10:43] TheItalianStallion321: im going to race to world last to lvl 40. i think i can do it
[2:10:51] Molvonos: Since half of their shit's gonna scale wildly with a Fire Mage in group, lol

[2:50:39] Kaykerrs: I wouldn't wait an hour I'd say after like 20 kills lol

[4:40:06] Zolshy89: who is this?
[4:40:23] aspiration89: @Molvonos Agreed. I wouldn't have taken the "promotion" until it was in writing, and if it was in writing, why did he sign knowing his pay didn't go up?
[4:40:27] Shrenko: this is Blizzard ?

[4:41:02] Shrenko: you cant just quit a job
[4:41:02] 91Niki: Gotta love an old gaslighting

[4:42:11] Ezcotli: Damn
[4:42:17] GameSlayer_TV: There may have been a lack of opportunities with other reputable companies.  Going from Bliz to a family owned company is rough and odds are comes with a pay cut. Honestly he stayed due to not having another good stable choice
[4:42:20] kokochris: he is quiting, so you dont need to sign anything.  he already resigned
[4:42:21] flyingmachin3: non competes are real things if you sign the documents when you onboard
[4:42:21] 91Niki: I really hope he can afford to get a lawyer
[4:42:22] Ezekyler: at least in spain no one can force you to sign to "not work in another place of the same sector for x time"

[4:48:15] TamaskaVT: I used to want to work at Blizzard until I actually spoke to a hiring manager at Blizzard. The way I was treated resulted in me saying, "nope" and never trying again.
[4:48:41] Neowanderer: unfortunately blizz takes advantage of your passion for their games

[4:51:11] Kaykerrs: facts
[4:51:32] nuuenergy: you need to buy the other item pattern too
[4:51:47] nuuenergy: the blue one for making the gear item
[4:51:57] Kaykerrs: you'll need 25 of those green reagents to make the 5 blue items to make the shield
[4:52:22] Kaykerrs: when you turn the encrusted things in for the box that drops the reagents it's a chance on how many you will get
[4:52:28] Kaykerrs: it can be 1-3 in each box

[4:54:16] Spinecloud: only 1 % of gamers even know blizzard was sold to microsoft lol
[4:54:33] wEiRdO_dUdE: Yep, that react meta
[4:55:11] Ezekyler: tomorrow is when Xbox says WoW is coming to consoles right? Kappa
[4:55:18] Bowwjack: @Towelliee most people care more about conspiracy theories rather than anything going on with a billion dollar game company
[4:55:29] 91Niki: towCopium
[4:55:38] jarilrpg: @TamaskaVT "Yes, we pay less, but its about the prestige of working at Blizzard"
[4:55:46] zodd_amhai: i just high from copium\
[4:56:00] wEiRdO_dUdE: In theory they could announce it, but I think it's shaping up to be more about Xbox titles going onto PS5
[4:56:11] zodd_amhai: its also best way to level engi
[4:57:00] wEiRdO_dUdE: It's tomorrow
[4:57:16] jarilrpg: thats the podcast thing tomorrow
[4:57:19] im_capy: I remember hearing stories back in the day of Blizz paying less to their devs, but it was considered an "honor" to work for them
[4:57:21] Ezekyler: it's about the future of Xbox
[4:57:44] Ezekyler: i don't think they will go full 3rd party
[4:57:55] TamaskaVT: Everything is going PC anyway
[4:57:55] DunzoCD: because you can play the xbox games on PC when they come out lol
[4:58:10] TamaskaVT: ^^

[4:58:23] jarilrpg: add "Microsoft Game Pass" to PS5
[4:58:35] neftario105: @Towelliee we will know tomorrow what will happen to Xbox
[4:58:36] Ezekyler: yea, i bet there is another Xbox console and maybe they move into a streaming/live service game platform
[4:58:43] neftario105: February 15
[4:58:48] TamaskaVT: Well there's cloud gaming that lets you play games on lower end PCs

[4:59:07] im_capy: I think Sony just mentioned that Ps5 didnt sell well last quarter....but then again, its still priced as if it was just released
[4:59:09] OlleverTV: Cant do before phase 3
[4:59:10] Zucchey: Also not having Xbox is bad as a consumer if you're only option is playstation they won't bother pleasing people without competition
[4:59:24] neftario105: Phil Spencer going to do a show tomorrow
[4:59:24] TamaskaVT: I mean even Playstation is starting to ship their games to PC like they did with Helldivers 2

[4:59:25] aspiration89: Microsoft has been getting out of the hardware game for years now. Wouldn't be surprised at all if they go 'cloud' gaming + pc gaming only.
[4:59:29] jarilrpg: @TamaskaVT my GF plays some game pass games on her tablet
[4:59:31] wakeandbacon95: LUL
[4:59:32] grosicky: @jarilrpg why would sony ever agree to have gamepass on their console
[4:59:51] neftario105: Nintendo and Playstation
[5:00:06] wEiRdO_dUdE: It is possible that Xbox goes with some kind of handheld devices, but I don't know
[5:00:07] neftario105: and I buy a Xbox lol
[5:00:23] theplayrsclub: unless nintendo steps it up they might not be a high contender either
[5:00:28] theplayrsclub: their systems are ass
[5:00:29] zodd_amhai: Xbox is just missing on exclusive games like elden ring and god of war, if they make games like that i honestly thing xbox will win this war @Towelliee
[5:00:31] jarilrpg: @grosicky if they have no hardware competition, what would it matter?
[5:01:01] robertjordan83: Zelda does
[5:01:02] trivotix: Nintendo is outselling playstation. Why would they change?
[5:01:05] neftario105: I think I'll go Playstation if Xbox is out lol Nintendo I dont know
[5:01:08] jarilrpg: @zodd_amhai any of their exclusive games can always be played on PC
[5:01:24] theplayrsclub: i mean their selling point is nostalgia?
[5:01:35] im_capy: Xbox just wants to go cloud gaming imo, all digital that works on Xbox or PC.
[5:01:40] vimie: didnt the Switch only get 1 price drop in the 7 years it's been out? LUL
[5:01:43] theplayrsclub: they only remake their old games
[5:01:54] wEiRdO_dUdE: There is Switch 2 coming up
[5:02:08] neftario105: Going to see @Towelliee cards on Ebay let me check to bid lol i'll be hearing
[5:02:09] im_capy: Switch games are WAY overpriced
[5:02:15] Ezekyler: yeah, Nintendo lives in their own world
[5:02:16] wakeandbacon95: CiGrip FeelsGoodMan
[5:02:18] DunzoCD: Nintendo hasnt been good since gamecube
[5:02:40] LordFaunty: @DunzoCD put some respec on the wii
[5:02:41] theplayrsclub: i heard they are porting WoW on switch 2
[5:03:13] TamaskaVT: I think people will be disappointed in Switch 2. The thing is even the Switch did cloud gaming for some of their games they released like Guardian's of the Galaxy.
[5:03:14] NotEnoughMana: all the switches :)
[5:03:18] wEiRdO_dUdE: SOD would probably play fine on Switch stuff LUL
[5:03:18] neftario105: lol
[5:03:20] im_capy: talk about lag
[5:03:21] MackPlays: The best selling system is the Nintendo DS
[5:03:22] LordFaunty: wow 3 on the gamesphere
[5:03:37] jkitchin75: @DunzoCD must be doing something right seeing as there still around
[5:03:43] neftario105: Bit on the Trall card
[5:03:50] MackPlays: Xbox going the way of Sega
[5:03:55] Spinecloud: why is xbox going belly up? not profitable anymore?
[5:03:55] zelours: Hay I can play WoW on my steam deck haha
[5:03:56] mozavich: 5Head idea: what if Xbox is planning to buy out SEGA and reintroduce the SEGA console system?? mind = blown
[5:03:56] theplayrsclub: i just dont think the switch 2 can come close to things like the steamdeck or even the logitech handhelds
[5:04:09] MackPlays: Steam 2
[5:04:11] neftario105: @MackPlays yes 3rd party
[5:04:12] Ezekyler: Sony says PS5 is on their final life cycle lol @Towelliee
[5:04:16] futomara01: time for sega's comeback
[5:04:29] AzedaNA: Microsoft wants to be the Netflix of games. They're going to leverage cloud gaming
[5:04:47] Rayisbeast: like every generation?
[5:04:50] im_capy: I hope its not a Google stadia 2.0
[5:04:53] aspiration89: @AzedaNA I agree.
[5:04:55] LordFaunty: my KFC PC plays wow just fine 👍
[5:04:57] AzedaNA: Wait until you're paying $30/mo for GamePass. That is the goal
[5:04:57] neftario105: Xbox is all about Gamepass and the Cloud and I that love consold dude
[5:05:04] theplayrsclub: i wonder what that means for bethesda do they make a contract with sony now ?
[5:05:14] wEiRdO_dUdE: As cloud gaming gets better and faster, yeah the hardware itself isn't as needed
[5:05:31] robertjordan83: Steam box model 2.0 for xbox
[5:05:31] Raksukeke: What shield you're crafting?
[5:05:33] aspiration89: @AzedaNA Everything else microsoft does now is a "service" so I can totally see them going that route.
[5:05:40] josephrt10: @towelliee good day sir any luck with the love rocket farm ?
[5:05:54] neftario105: @theplayrsclub we know tomorrow my friend patience is a virtue lol
[5:06:05] im_capy: Steamdeck been selling really well
[5:06:32] AzedaNA: Phil Spencer is better on a future 10 years from now and it will likely work to all of our disadvantage

[5:07:03] MackPlays: Every PC with Windows is an "Xbox"
[5:07:08] im_capy: @mozavich lmao no you dont

[6:03:14] wEiRdO_dUdE: I would think the bad luck protection is for personal loot, not when it drops for the raid
[6:03:55] im_capy: Hopefully they were wise enough to make sure it needed to be equipt to change the bad luck stuff....but its Blizz, so chances are they missed it

[6:08:04] wEiRdO_dUdE: Chase items are fine with me, but I think the bad luck tokens need to add like 5% a piece
[6:08:13] geokouts: afk?
[6:08:52] devildriver1919: going 13+ weeks without it just..is dumb on 3 chars
[6:09:00] Dlucks83: There needs to be an actual number to each token
[6:09:43] im_capy: or a currency you earn, and then buy it
[6:09:53] Dlucks83: People that have collected 10+ greater and 20+ lesser kind of rightfully so going are they even working?
[6:09:56] devildriver1919: or just make it 10 fryrakk kills. boomy leggy

[6:11:52] wEiRdO_dUdE: Being able to upgrade the legendaries in season 4 to keep them relevant would be good
[6:11:57] Elizare: do you think the evoker lego from season 2 will be upgradeable in season 4 if you already have it?
[6:12:13] devildriver1919: they want to value our time as players, but do shit like this
[6:12:28] devildriver1919: im at 30+ weeks of not getting evoker leggy too
