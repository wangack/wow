[1:31:31] CritcobainTV: @Towelliee that's why when we did that sanguine, the first boss was spinning in circles LUL
[1:32:08] shimwood: I think Xy'exa and Mueh'zala are the only boss fights I actually know in this dungeon LuL everything else I just try to burn down
[1:32:20] jdickson93: good old bobsalami, i wish i was horde for BFA to see him more LUL

[1:34:31] GoKu1g: @Towelliee We can see ur chat u know? your ingame chat??
[1:34:53] Veegore: They brought him in mostly because of the voice actor, they enjoyed him too much
[1:34:58] Jesperoni: hes like rob schneider in old adam sandler movies
[1:34:58] jdickson93: they said in the voice over panel that they liked the actor so much they brought him back
[1:35:00] shimwood: He's busy macking on the Winter Queen
[1:35:05] Masqerader: He will be the new Wrathion
[1:35:10] Klauzzer: night fae campaing has bwomsamdi shit
[1:35:17] Vivelli: i wouldnt mind him making cameos further down the line now though
[1:35:39] Bowwjack: duck em up Towelliee <3
[1:36:10] jdickson93: but yeah i agree, his main story is probably done but his random appearances are fun just because i love his voice so much lol, i hope he does pop up every so often moving forward
[1:36:13] JayajtheWolf: So how do you make the slimes go away?
[1:36:23] Masqerader: @JayajtheWolf engineering
[1:36:25] jdickson93: @JayajtheWolf i think its an engineer thing
[1:36:32] JayajtheWolf: Oooooh nice
[1:36:38] Veegore: They'll bring him back more when voljin hatches from his egg
[1:36:39] Masqerader: @JayajtheWolf in that room there is a big red button
[1:37:16] Sweetzer81: yeah save CDs for millificent
[1:37:37] Vivelli: fury warr lookin good so far in this dungeon
[1:38:05] CritcobainTV: @Towelliee in high keys you always need someone using cds on a prideful. otherwise the damage they do is gonna kill you
[1:38:23] Frostfury: Big fat tauren Kappa

[1:41:06] rocthenite: zero fucks
[1:41:19] Klauzzer: bruh
[1:41:36] jdickson93: if they had skipping RP would they lower the timer time?
[1:41:44] Xailen: Dungeon RP should be in Normal mode only.
[1:41:47] cuzzie_: So, i will ask again,  i've recently started using Raider IO, is there an easy way to see what to pull next?  or do i just consult the map everytime?  I've scoured the net for an answer,  but can't find anything  :)
[1:42:16] CritcobainTV: @Crypt_Raider you mean in terms of routes for a dungeon?
[1:42:24] mari_ren: you mean Raider IO or Mythic Dungeon Tools?
[1:42:27] Jesperoni: gotta use your brain @Crypt_Raider
[1:42:32] Bowwjack: totally Towelliee skipping RP is a must in M+ it wasn't as bad last xpac or legion but this one it's a snooze fest
[1:42:38] Finni2011: towHAMUP towHAMUP
[1:42:45] cuzzie_: Mythic Dungeon Tools.
[1:42:47] fixate_wow: @Crypt_Raider Download "mythic dungeon tools" then go to the io for routes
[1:42:57] cuzzie_: @Jesperoni gee thanks  :)
[1:43:07] fixate_wow: io has the routes
[1:43:07] CritcobainTV: @Crypt_Raider it's just practice man. You look at the map and memorize it, and then just practice it until you know what to pull
[1:43:22] fixate_wow: you import them into MDT
[1:43:27] Masqerader: he also released instead of taking  a bres?
[1:43:30] Contendedlemon: he stood in lotus's i think
[1:43:31] cuzzie_: @critcobain ok cool,  i thought that was the case,  just thought i was missing something  :)
[1:43:33] Vivelli: there are premade routes from wago for mdt, other than that its first hand knowledge
[1:43:38] Mecabeast: was he blasted off the edge?
[1:43:39] Contendedlemon: all mobs were stuned
[1:44:05] mari_ren: @Crypt_Raider tip: make a macro to open up MDT with only one keybind, it does help when you're not used to your routes

[1:45:02] Jesperoni: ping maybe?
[1:45:12] Masqerader: ya the healer took 40k from a dark lotus

[1:45:54] TiredCarcass: unfort

[2:19:39] CritcobainTV: @smashwow really good for your alts tho
[2:20:06] CritcobainTV: @Towelliee don't say that dude! there's one massive prot pally change
[2:20:19] CritcobainTV: @Towelliee now their Ardent Defender heal when it procs  has a visual component KEKW
[2:20:49] smashwow: maybe but it doesn't make it feel good. they basically went yeah there's a problem but here's a half assed solution @critcobain
[2:21:28] CritcobainTV: no i agree, its not a great fix for anything, it's a mediocre bandaid they slapped on a big wound, but ya know
[2:21:47] smashwow: it's an improvement. but we shouldn't be happy with it's implementation
[2:21:59] Buckwink: is that a frost DK Pog
[2:22:33] fistofnature: Bleed dmg KEKW
[2:22:43] ea_phex: but how the f does 220 help  with alts, if i have to do all 15 with them before i even get that
[2:22:57] ea_phex: or is that restriction account wide?
[2:22:59] CritcobainTV: @ea_phex KSM is account wide my dude
[2:23:06] ea_phex: well ksm is
[2:23:08] fistofnature: well 220 should help you get into +14 groups
[2:23:13] smashwow: KSM is account wide. but it doesn't mean the gear unlock is
[2:23:17] ea_phex: but is the unlock for vendor as well?
[2:23:27] ea_phex: because pvp vendor unlock is not
[2:23:36] CritcobainTV: two diff things.
[2:23:45] ea_phex: well, are you sure about that?
[2:23:47] smashwow: but you can unlock different tiers of upgrades that will help on the alts. it's not the 220 it's more of the system that helps alts
[2:23:49] okoflux: usually i pull the cats before going left
[2:23:59] ea_phex: because as far as i understood you have to unlock every single character
[2:24:26] smashwow: @ea_phex yeah but each tier prior of the KSM achievement unlocks different ilvls

[2:26:29] Gibbuffa: too high for a low reward
[2:26:31] Bowwjack: I think it should be a 10 tbh
[2:26:33] smashwow: IF you have multiple toons that can do 15s.

[3:27:20] Revelations45: lol
[3:27:28] luckfore: id take BFA over SL any day
[3:27:37] kharnij83: just pray Riots MMO is worth a shit
[3:27:38] WhatYeti: I miss MoP
[3:27:48] MysticalOS: i'll be honest I dislike shadowlands so far. least alt friendly in a long time. story telling is pretty badly formated in that you only get literally 1/4th the story. first time you did dungeons you had no idea why you were even there. bad story telling
[3:27:50] GamerKillance: Whether or not you found it fun the cinimatic, rushed story and constant bug fixes shows it was rushed
[3:27:52] Shrenko: fuuuck corruption
[3:27:55] solsaver12: I just find SL so boring
[3:27:56] chrslp: @Towelliee Think Beta is gonna start same time as 9.0.5?
[3:28:03] sphynx_rayne: after this I liked BFA then SL :/
[3:28:08] rocthenite: rish critasize bfa for being bobby kostic maze but spend thoundends on web gasha games
[3:28:10] ForklyftTV: BFA had alot of good ideas that had poor execution
[3:28:20] Redbearded16: @mysticalos I thought bfa with corruption and AP was far less apt friendly
[3:28:30] deadman385: it was amazing cuz you did damage for once
[3:28:36] GamerKillance: They tied azerite to everything which killed BFA for a lot of people hence the changes so early on
[3:28:38] pk99: covid drought FeelsBadMan
[3:28:43] wasserhammer: I'm just bored in Shadowlands.
[3:28:47] solsaver12: yup too many systems
[3:28:48] kharnij83: for someone with not much time top play and then what time u invest u dont get gear from Mythic runs and shit. thats why i hate this expac
[3:28:59] wasserhammer: it's too many systems and not enough content
[3:29:08] MysticalOS: @Redbearded16 those things only mattered to high end raiders. anima matters to everyone including casuals
[3:29:12] MysticalOS: that's the huge distinction
[3:29:15] yxan1985: tbh Who even does wq in SL?
[3:29:32] Gnral: s4 xddd was a full time job with visions and shhit
[3:29:33] solsaver12: I quit doing wq's
[3:29:35] sphynx_rayne: @kharnij83 I feel the same way. that Sl not as good for me
[3:29:39] GamerKillance: Anima is cosmetic only which is good. Bad thing is the immense grind it takes for them
[3:29:41] Holysal: i still dont understand why theres conduit energy
[3:29:43] solsaver12: I quit doing Torghast
[3:30:06] Holyschannel: towelie arenas eww
[3:30:07] rocthenite: you are the new heels
[3:30:19] GamerKillance: People still do torg? Lol that shit was dead week one of twisted corridors. That content died QUICK
[3:30:46] MysticalOS: when more than 50% of players are LFR heroes, they don't care about having capped artifact power, but in shadowlands everyone cares that they can't upgrade their sanctum and their souls are capped and the maw is an unfun slog. suramar, that was good end game zone, the maw? half assed filler

[3:31:01] cordawg: WoW will never be forever lasting until raiding goes back to 1 difficulty, and things that support raiding, like crafting consumables, support raiding like they did in Vanilla.  Thats a true MMORPG.
[3:31:09] Infinitepeeep: @Towelliee u left BG queue
[3:31:09] GamerKillance: Torghast is the new islands/warfronts. It died just like them
[3:31:26] CrusaderNero: the anima costs is just to high
[3:31:34] MrPiingo: Hi @Towelliee i'm not the most regular viewer but i have seen you're not using your camera anymore?Why's that? :) hope you had a great day!
[3:31:50] GamerKillance: Ya Vanilla wasn't the end all of raiding. To say its ideal is hypocritical since classic showed people HATE that @cordawg
[3:31:51] ForklyftTV: queue as alliance

[3:31:59] Lazugo: @MrPiingo !cam
[3:32:02] MrPiingo: !cam
[3:32:02] Moobot: towelliee is currently taking some medication for his skin that requires him not to wear a shirt. so in the interest of not breaking TOS, he wont have a cam on for a couple of days
[3:32:06] swordwindgaming: I still run Torghast, but I keep them to 30-40 min runs.
[3:32:12] MrPiingo: @Lazugo cheers mate
[3:32:16] MysticalOS: I wish they'd make torghast autoloot. it'd go a long way to make torghast faster and smoother
[3:32:19] Lazugo: @MrPiingo No problem man
[3:32:31] rocthenite: naa preach is not that fansy of SL, he hated CN and rated it lower then Ny
[3:32:32] solsaver12: funny how ppl get so hype over new expansion only to find few weeks into it, it sucks
[3:32:35] Holyschannel: no no no dont talk about the grindpls
[3:32:44] Holyschannel: legion was horrible
[3:32:52] cordawg: @Towelliee you are also coming at this game from someone who is playing the game 10+ hours a day.  98% of people dont do that.
[3:33:02] burnt420: LUL
[3:33:03] solsaver12: I felt from beginning of SL it was gonna be crap
[3:33:09] GamerKillance: Vanilla was a good prototype, but TBC showed how well it could be refined. Classic showed how poorly raiding back then was and how people detest it. Leveling is fun though first time
[3:33:10] Repsifu: @Holyschannel ? :S Legion was the most amazing x-pac the hell ur talking about ? :D
[3:33:12] bloke_down_under: grind in wow is yuk
[3:33:18] rocthenite: and asmon and rich won't ammet since they got everything they wanted
[3:33:23] MysticalOS: legion had great story and zones and suramar was amazing. they botched artifact weapons/kn owledge and legendaries at beginning and that ruined 7.0-7.2
[3:33:26] deadman385: fucked up A Aron
[3:33:32] Holyschannel: realy legion was good haha
[3:33:43] DrakeDuude: suppose to be the best alt expansion. i hate it worse the last 3 expansions for alts.
[3:33:45] Holyschannel: it was shit to the ground
[3:34:27] Repsifu: We need WOW 2 @Towelliee
[3:34:32] ForklyftTV: Legion was the best of the 3 by miles
[3:34:45] cordawg: Again, not everybody plays 10 hours a day.  This expansion feels good as far as content.
[3:34:57] cordawg: I dont feel behind because i cant play that many hours a day
[3:35:19] NOHITJEROME: im thinking about getting taco bell tonight

[3:49:10] jerseyfive: def no blood dk, they get b!tch slaped hard

[3:50:00] cyberratt: except bears lose full moon in convokes on tuesday
[3:50:00] cryft: they said they're making the new 'engine' basically just a re-render of the old one so it should play exactly the same
[3:50:05] Kael88: No more full moons in .5 though FeelsBadMan
[3:50:06] Strik3r019: wait what? so start playing ladder D2 right now?

[3:53:40] Shrenko: thank you China
[3:53:46] Kael88: It was probably RMT too
[3:53:55] Holysal: it was
[3:54:08] Holysal: they play the accounts
[3:54:09] dernybaggins: nobody cares about alliance guilds
[3:54:23] Wulfgrym: lol
[3:54:31] thunder993: think according to chinese tos, account sharing isn't banned
[3:54:38] Throdio: I mean, there no proof that the people behind those emails aren't a Nigerian prince
[3:54:40] Darzetti_: o yea tbc time
[3:54:40] michaelmm: Icy veins is saying that the guilds involved are being stripped of their achievements and banned for RMT.
[3:54:49] NOHITJEROME: ya 35-40 in classic is where it slooooooows down
[3:54:53] NOHITJEROME: but rested xp is amazing 40+
[3:54:53] Kael88: And then we have some of the top pvp players that can't even due coaching because they get banned
[3:54:59] Kael88: do*
[3:55:02] Wildside1177: 55 to 60 was brutal.
[3:55:05] Pufendorf99: thats what classic is, 90% running
[3:55:11] Kyrrua: that moment when you learn that reaching lvl 47 means you only did half the leveling time in classic Kappa
[3:55:13] KizaruGR: I always find the ending levels to be the most tedious xD
[3:55:15] PokerFaceMoose: you do 10 quests one place, then the next set are 4 levels higher
[3:55:16] dernybaggins: I used a questing guide for my classic warrior cause i hate thinking
[3:55:19] Ishva: that 30 to 42 grind was so bad for me
[3:55:28] NOHITJEROME: 30-40 is probably where like 90% of the population quits classic LUL
[3:55:42] NOHITJEROME: it goes from 2-3 levels per day to like 1 level per day
[3:56:07] ninedraft317: i always say 30-40 is the worst leveling
[3:56:20] NOHITJEROME: @ninedraft317 thats why i usually spend 90% of it in scarlett monastery LUL
[3:56:21] Chuckforfun: @Towelliee do you want the exil google doc stuff is reallsy good?
[3:56:29] NOHITJEROME: on launch a lot of people skipped 30-40 with SM but it gets monotonous
[3:56:32] Kyrrua: 30 to 40 is easy if you spam scarlet monastery LUL
[3:56:39] NOHITJEROME: 40-50 weirdly doesnt feel as bad because you see the finish line
[3:56:50] NOHITJEROME: 30-40 is the sloooowest part
[3:57:08] Mecabeast: you can get ele water from north mid of arathi but the mobs are like lvl40
[3:57:22] Kyrrua: for me the worst moment is arround lvl 47.
[3:57:26] D3m0nHunt3r666: Badlands Kappa
[3:57:38] NOHITJEROME: @Kyrrua 47-48ish is easily a 2 day affair
[3:57:44] NOHITJEROME: zf is a nice level though
[3:58:20] NOHITJEROME: 48-60 with rested is great
[3:58:25] MysticalOS: i honestly got to 54 in classic and ran out of quests to do I could do solo, was literally at a stalemate so that's where I quit
[3:58:25] NOHITJEROME: i might just make it a 3 month deal LUL
[3:58:31] FalconBroadcasting: I'm level 48, how do I start this supposed fast leveling?
[3:58:46] George2001k: This patch just gives us the valor changes right? Or do we get a new mythic plus season?
[3:58:53] NOHITJEROME: @FalconBroadcasting step 1: log out for a week and get a full level of rested xp LUL
[3:59:09] Kyrrua: well my mevel until 47 id always easy. just that lvl 46-47 you have this moment when no quest and grinding is better
[3:59:18] FalconBroadcasting: Done. Been logged out for 8 months
[3:59:24] swordwindgaming: 3 months NotLikeThis
[3:59:42] Zaptica: I should get back in to classic I miss this
[3:59:48] George2001k: I like the valor thing, we need more gear...
[3:59:49] MysticalOS: this is blizzard, they'll probably heroic test 4 bosses first week of ptr whilie it's still unstable, because reasons
[3:59:53] GermanBacon: windwalker testing alone will take 1 month KEKW
[4:00:07] TheUnknowing: im pretty sure it will be june but who knows
[4:00:08] Kyrrua: in term of doing all the quest ofc, not always farming zf
[4:00:12] mintcookie_vajankle: Mega dungeon?
[4:00:42] TheUnknowing: new mega dungeon in 9.1, like kara in legion or mechagon in bfa @Mintcookielgfu

[5:53:19] CholThemAll: The new necro sounds good indeed, but again the banner is a bit questionable, isn't it? First, its very stationary as a playstyle & then it affects only the 2 nearest allies. Might require a lot of adjusting to make it work/benefit the proper people. Or maybe i'm reading it wrong?
