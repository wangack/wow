[0:42:21] Skipiz852: will you be loosing a lot of healing potential from the talents if you go into raids with pvp shadow spec in p2 ?
[0:42:41] Sinostra: there's a guy in the Auberdine inn that gives you a quest to loot an item on Aquanis, and upon turn in, it will pop a portal to Zoram
[0:43:55] Sinostra: the portal stays forever
[0:44:14] morginpoe: cause we dont stink mann :)
[0:44:19] Sinostra: yeah, horde has a fp
[0:44:28] Arjibhaji: Yeah the Alliance port is like the north beach in Zoram
[0:44:39] Gwent: are you afking?
[0:46:02] Haglers: Thinking of playing what server has best balance with horde and alliance
[0:46:39] mokabear: Apparently Alliance have a much higher win % in Ashenvale, but I didn't read into it

[0:50:26] grenis_: your group could use some more priests imo
[0:50:33] cyanne112: the thing is, it doesnt really mater if you win or not, it's all about the rep

[1:21:47] Fanboij96: Can u get rank 3 in one week?
[1:21:49] Fanboij96: from 0
[1:22:15] fakemejo: +
[1:22:21] Bloch29: Is shadow priest a thing now in pvp?
[1:23:25] veil_dust: If you have multiple priests in your team, should only one use PoM?
[1:23:37] jjshiffy: what professions should a priest get?
[1:24:29] jjshiffy: ty
[1:25:29] jujujay_myalias: Mage healing isn't affected by healing power or buffs like amplify/dampen magic. Do you think Mortal Strike will not affect mage healing? Has it been tested with troll priest racial?
[1:25:34] Bloch29: How many classes (not characters) will you play in next phase?
[1:26:12] Drumme13: If you were in charge of SoD PvP at Blizzard, what would you implement?

[1:29:42] Drumme13: If you worked at blizzard, what would u do to improve SoD PvP (not class design, but like RBG, arenas, other pvp events etc.)
[1:29:53] T4syloO: hello whene phase 2 starts?
[1:29:55] Fanboij96: Can u go from 0 to rank 3 in 1 week @Hydramist ?
[1:29:59] T4syloO: when*
[1:29:59] Crawstorm: arena in SoD would be fun :P
[1:30:01] PluuStream: PluuStream subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 3 months! 
[1:30:11] veil_dust: 1v1 arena would be kinda crazy in sod since even healers now do dmg
[1:31:13] Lunaatj: That'd be pretty cool actually.
[1:31:16] jjshiffy: good idea
[1:31:37] veil_dust: Would use the ring from Orgrimmar for that 1v1 arena
[1:31:55] KussTV: Hey, hope all is well brother
[1:33:02] veil_dust: Is that some custom text above characters or am I tripping?
[1:33:40] Lunaatj: Bro the eagle gear literally saved you.

[1:36:54] Lunaatj: OMEGALUL
[1:36:56] Lunaatj: Warrior brain.

[1:37:04] Lunaatj: Surely.
[1:37:06] Lunaatj: Kappa
[1:38:14] Lunaatj: It's complete shite.
[1:38:21] Lunaatj: KEKW
[1:38:41] Lunaatj: I'm going to bed soon, I guess that is relatively alright for a sleep schedule.
[1:38:46] Lunaatj: Compare to what I've been doing.
[1:38:57] Lunaatj: Not working doesn't help not having a degen sleep schedule for sure.
[1:38:58] stilfor: imagine the level 40 wb doesnt have run speed
[1:39:31] Zelimeth: mount speed instead! :D
[1:40:18] mokabear: Yeah, it'll be mount speed tbh
[1:40:35] Evilteddies: how do they have all high tier moves at 25?

[1:41:06] Egobulldozer: there is nothing worse in WoW than a turtle wsg.
[1:41:47] Evilteddies: anyone know why they have top tier moves? haven’t played wow in a couple months
[1:42:25] Lunaatj: @Evilteddies New WoW mode, Seasons of Discovery.
[1:42:34] Lunaatj: Comes with runes you can put on gear.
[1:42:45] Lunaatj: Which gives you these skills.
[1:42:47] Evilteddies: @lunaatj  no way! bro that’s so dope.
[1:42:58] Lunaatj: Yeah, it's super fun.
[1:43:23] Lunaatj: Also comes in phases, P1 has a level cap of 25.
[1:43:29] Lunaatj: Next will be capped at 40.
[1:43:35] Lunaatj: BFD is a 10 man raid in P1.
[1:43:38] Evilteddies: ah; okay. that’s pretty cool.
[1:43:47] Evilteddies: so you just activate it? looks like classic wow
[1:43:59] Lunaatj: Yeah, just buy a wow sub and you can play it.
[1:44:05] m3wk: which addon allows you to see enemy buffs?
[1:44:08] Zelimeth: randle is not scared

[2:04:37] Talgarx: as a whole
[2:04:44] Tnormous92: both
[2:04:46] ciscow: both
[2:04:48] veil_dust: Both in case they let us change priest specific ones
[2:04:52] Neverwind_: Both but you can also have a small area for what is bis for pve and what for pvp
[2:05:02] Arjibhaji: Rank them as two lists and then do a bis race + racial choice for s2?
[2:05:15] Neverwind_: and your opinion for overall
[2:05:25] Fanboij96: U get rep
[2:05:27] Zelimeth: a bit like av, main boss gets weaker i think
[2:05:28] Fanboij96: from all the small adds
[2:05:39] Plushie__Tv: main boss is immune unless all 3 die i think
[2:05:43] veil_dust: I wanna be undead with DP and Shadowguard so bad
[2:06:56] Plushie__Tv: west point is usually a hit or a miss, can be slow or no one goes to it
[2:06:59] Sinostra: loot it
[2:07:03] Sinostra: loot the boss
[2:07:05] Sinostra: 1k rep
[2:07:39] Fanboij96: U just dot it once and run dot lumber once run and last boss
[2:07:45] pappijota: !newvid

[2:08:09] Fanboij96: For ultimate rep :D
[2:08:43] veil_dust: LUL
[2:08:47] MxKV__: LUL
[2:08:53] lindardrel: that’ll do it
[2:09:02] Zelimeth: ress sick if ur closer
[2:09:05] Sinostra: Ashenvale is a dangerous place lmao
[2:10:05] Zelimeth: randle would've lived
[2:10:41] Sinostra: Do you like the concept of hardcore ?
[2:10:56] sethvlad: track humanoids incoming
[2:11:30] keez1g: !newvid
[2:11:30] Nightbot: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DT8n61Bgc60
[2:12:20] Sinostra: hc seems so counterintuitive
[2:12:23] jujujay_myalias: flightpath!
[2:12:32] Sinostra: the game's designed around that fact of dying
[2:13:27] correone: That tourny was sick, u got secound right?
[2:13:58] derty93: hi as a priest are the epic boots worth it for us? im doing the quest now. Id lose 2 set if i wore them tho since i dont have the chest yet
[2:14:13] cheza1337: Tetsu-priest :D
[2:14:15] derty93: even if i lose the 2 set?
[2:15:07] Fanboij96: you cant damage him when one of the other bosses is up!
[2:16:31] Neverwind_: The epic boots are strong when you need the hit, but for casters in BFD oi+WB gets you hit capped. So you can use the 2x set for extra 2sp and 3 intellect
[2:17:45] Sinostra: yeah
[2:17:52] JustOndore: 12 raiders from JustOndore have joined! 
[2:18:18] Neverwind_: ah for pvp sure the boots are insane!
[2:18:34] JustOndore: Just raided goldshire :P
[2:19:07] luzid7: i made 37 bgs now and won 4 of them in solo que LOL
[2:19:11] JustOndore: JustOndore subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 6 months! Yeah I think we only had 1 priest and he just got the buff and left LUL
[2:19:40] Sinostra: you're welcome
[2:20:02] Sinostra: also, you can turn in the weekly quest here
[2:20:36] asuna_qt: !cata
[2:22:15] mokabear: Volume is good
[2:22:43] Neverwind_: easiest 1k rep with wsg
[2:23:16] Neverwind_: fair
[2:23:36] Zelimeth: phase 2 based or overall classic
[2:24:06] ripcitytwitchlord: ew human male
[2:24:12] Sinostra: also, can you explain briefly what each racial does ?
[2:25:18] ImOdyssey: u telling me I rolled ugly dwarf for nothing?
[2:25:36] Fanboij96: @ImOdyssey Yes, I love my human with EPIC STAFF <3
[2:25:41] fakemejo: cam  is blocking abit of the view
[2:25:42] Arjibhaji: Ups my wand DPS when I pop it so I think it does?
[2:25:54] Zelimeth: yea casts and attacks, i'd assume it effects wand too
[2:25:55] Arjibhaji: And yeah attack and cast speed
[2:26:00] noteimoo: doesnt work on globals and channels
[2:26:24] noteimoo: yeah
[2:27:39] Fanboij96: A tier! cuse u will use mana pot and then u kinda have a HP pot asvell?
[2:27:43] Neverwind_: Desperate prayers gets +healing?
[2:27:58] Neverwind_: :O
[2:28:03] Zelimeth: is it on gcd
[2:28:10] racerkill: that's just the standard instant amount
[2:28:28] Sinostra: 10 minutes cd is long
[2:28:55] Neverwind_: You will survive the burst
[2:29:04] prodigy_wow: I love maintaining out of combat regen with DP
[2:29:13] prodigy_wow: desperate prayer*
[2:29:16] twoxxl: ooming plague
[2:29:50] enjoyinftw: D:
[2:30:27] Zelimeth: it's purgeable! elunes grace is baddd
[2:30:36] TV_Kuro: RANGED*
[2:30:38] booddhi: ranged dmg
[2:30:39] prodigy_wow: ranged damage :o
[2:31:00] prodigy_wow: lower dmg from quick shot and between the eyes :D
[2:31:08] Zelimeth: i'd pick bezerking over this
[2:31:08] booddhi: D
[2:31:08] racerkill: 5 min cd too
[2:31:09] Zelimeth: deffo
[2:31:16] enjoyinftw: dont use it tier Kappa
[2:31:30] Zelimeth: @enjoyinftw kek
[2:31:50] Sinostra: feedback is worse
[2:32:01] Jigidog: !talents
[2:32:01] Nightbot: https://www.youtube.com/shorts/o1HC3zbP4H8
[2:32:07] OGWerm: im bringing presents
[2:32:14] Neverwind_: S
[2:32:20] Fanboij96: S tier
[2:32:45] Zelimeth: it's crazy vs wrath version. 30s cd? :D
[2:33:27] Zelimeth: which race is this from
[2:33:38] Sinostra: yeah but it also damages
[2:33:40] Neverwind_: This is inhuman
[2:33:45] Zelimeth: is it on romeyoyo's bars :D
[2:33:46] booddhi: LUL
[2:34:14] prodigy_wow: Wish this was a useable spell
[2:34:16] prodigy_wow: its cool
[2:35:03] Neverwind_: It has cooldown?
[2:35:11] Neverwind_: :O
[2:35:21] Fanboij96: thats sick
[2:36:03] Fanboij96: 5% Spirit! S TIER!
[2:36:49] Fanboij96: but it consumes it dosent it?
[2:37:02] booddhi: 35 dmg
[2:37:10] Fanboij96: B at MAX
[2:37:12] Zelimeth: i think u use it for the MS
[2:37:13] Zelimeth: more than dmg
[2:37:21] Sinostra: can hex of weakness proc blackout ?
[2:37:31] eRzJkee: @Sinostra No
[2:37:56] nfs65: nfs65 watched 3 consecutive streams this month and sparked a watch streak! sup
[2:38:10] enjoyinftw: the delivery service that pays you for accepting his goods Pog
[2:38:12] OGWerm: love love
[2:38:15] Nouse__: one trip or shitebag
[2:38:37] Nightbot: Follow Hydra's twitter! https://twitter.com/hydramist
[2:44:37] veil_dust: Hydra has homies IRL
[2:45:29] racerkill: @Hydramist Touch of weakness should proc blackout. This was added in patch 1.4. according to wowpedia.
[2:45:55] Neverwind_: was there a case different ranks of touch of weakness would stack?
[2:46:06] iitsAK: doesnt it have to do shadow dmg to proc blackout?
[2:46:11] booddhi: druids
[2:46:14] Zelimeth: good for STV angle
[2:46:19] Sinostra: and feral druids
[2:46:30] Zelimeth: does it work vs invis pots
[2:46:30] 7idus: @Hydramist Do you think shadow priest will be in good shape for pvp next phase?
[2:46:32] varaipad: @hydramist blizzard need delete cast in starshards?
[2:46:33] luggi0815: warri wil become invis to ...
[2:47:49] iitsAK: shadowguard is op
[2:47:58] Neverwind_: True!
[2:47:58] Sinostra: no way it's better than dp
[2:48:07] DatSadBoy: can't you just change your racials next phase? they were talking about that on dev dive
[2:48:11] racerkill: desperate prayer is 10 min cd tho
[2:48:21] iitsAK: 10m cd on prayer tho
[2:48:22] Neverwind_: tbh DP is near S rank\
[2:48:28] iitsAK: no cd on sg
[2:48:48] Neverwind_: Shadowguard > hex imo
[2:48:49] racerkill: in bg when other people can heal you shadow guard might be better
[2:48:55] iitsAK: isnt hex like 2m cd
[2:49:04] Neverwind_: xD
[2:49:29] iitsAK: just a safe drinking tool
[2:49:30] eRzJkee: E tier
[2:49:33] Neverwind_: You can drink and then shadowmend?
[2:49:41] Neverwind_: shadowmeld?
[2:49:45] RamboSupreme: its only really strong for rogues i think
[2:49:51] life_waste: meld shield combat drinks
[2:49:53] luggi0815: its nice for reg
[2:49:54] iitsAK: C tier you'll occasionally use it
[2:50:00] iitsAK: i bind it with my drink
[2:50:06] iitsAK: 10s cd
[2:50:06] maaunakea: !song
[2:50:07] Neverwind_: nah too weak
[2:50:07] racerkill: it's actually a bit useful, c imo
[2:50:22] maaunakea: what the music maaan
[2:50:35] iitsAK: z tier
[2:50:41] eRzJkee: starshard its rofl ability
[2:51:03] Neverwind_: channel :(
[2:51:04] iitsAK: maybe a good taunt
[2:51:07] iitsAK: in pvp
[2:51:15] Neverwind_: arcane dmg type...
[2:51:38] cyanne112: can u bait CS with it?
[2:51:41] fdaapproved123: you use it to fake a cs
[2:51:41] Sinostra: what magic school is it ?
[2:51:44] cyanne112: or does it lock your holy?
[2:51:48] Neverwind_: so no Bo procs
[2:51:51] racerkill: at least in tbc it was a dot and had no mana cost
[2:51:59] iitsAK: expensive bait mind u
[2:52:02] Neverwind_: no +shddmg
[2:52:14] Neverwind_: Hearthstone :D
[2:52:15] iitsAK: yup
[2:52:18] Its_Ponti: Could time it to cast when someone is about to run around a corner
[2:52:20] Doronjoo: At 40 some classes will have 2k+ so this doesn't make sense
[2:52:22] Fanboij96: What about the 5% Spirit from humans?
[2:52:27] FatStinkyBaggy: rank 1 bait
[2:52:32] Fanboij96: Aiti
[2:52:33] Doronjoo: @Doronjoo HP
[2:53:07] Neverwind_: Viper sting counter, gold value!
[2:53:12] iitsAK: ye blind is poison
[2:53:18] racerkill: or it removes void plague now too....
[2:53:46] mathwins: poisons from rogue is big
[2:53:58] v3lik: if u in shadow form and get cs on shadow spells, u can cast starshards sounds better than chenge form LUL
[2:54:01] racerkill: it removes blind too right
[2:54:07] fdaapproved123: it doesn't only remove it it make you immune for 8sec to them after removing them too. its big
[2:54:13] iitsAK: sf saved me many times in wpvp
[2:54:19] Neverwind_: A big plus is removes all poisons, diseases etc
[2:54:27] Neverwind_: So even with 7 debuffs poof
[2:55:00] sanzador: below imo
[2:55:04] Fanboij96: Its the best for PVP
[2:55:05] veil_dust: Stoneform stronger in SoD, weaker in Era
[2:55:06] Fanboij96: tbh
[2:55:10] iitsAK: ye i think it number 1
[2:55:10] tuskygodx: its better cus of warriors
[2:55:15] ApachyAK: WOF is god tier in classic not even close
[2:55:24] Sinostra: can players get feared by turn undead after using will ?
[2:55:30] mathwins: its a second trinket basically, yes
[2:55:36] Neverwind_: so you counter hard reset
[2:55:51] iitsAK: 5s is a long time too and just 2m cd
[2:55:54] veil_dust: it also removes rocket helm right?
[2:55:59] mathwins: only 2min cd is crazy good aswell
[2:56:19] Sinostra: aren't players considered undead under will ?
[2:56:20] grilledcheeseistasty: @Hydramist think shadow is gonna be good next phase? what kind of runes would you want to see it get?
[2:56:27] Sinostra: meaning shackle
[2:56:30] Neverwind_: pretty strong!
[2:56:51] grilledcheeseistasty: @Hydramist as far as runes would you want to see shadowfiend? the stealth ability shit like that?
[2:57:00] sanzador: devouring plague b tier because of disease dispels?
[2:57:05] OGWerm: tap in game
[2:57:06] racerkill: surely shadow meld is better than starshards
[2:57:08] veil_dust: death plague might become A if they give us more mana in phase 2
[2:57:10] FatesFavoriteFool: where is cannibalism
[2:57:14] iitsAK: looks good cheif. Id prolly put shadow guard S tier. cheap and spammable dmg+stun chance
[2:57:17] iitsAK: but i panic a lot
[2:57:42] iitsAK: sg saved me many times with rogue when i just wanted some time to get to my fear
[2:57:59] rakaposhii: shadowmeld B-tier, i would say
[2:58:02] Fanboij96: I still think that the human stealth thingy is better then C Tbh, so many times I find rogues with it in WSG its not broken but I think its a B tier not a C
[2:58:06] Eavesdropz93: do priests ever get a second fear?
[2:58:13] noteimoo: agree shadowguard stier
[2:58:31] mathwins: devouring plague could be A tier imho
[2:58:53] mathwins: the gap to the c tier spells is too big for being it B tier
[2:59:53] Sinostra: @Fanboij96 yeah, and doesn't it get even better when stacked with other stealth detection buffs ?
[2:59:59] noteimoo: idk, dp is like 500 mana for 400 dmg, pretty bad
[3:00:12] veil_dust: isn't dp also healing you a bit?
[3:00:17] Sinostra: also, as a human warlock, will of the forsaken is the geatest bane of my existence
[3:00:25] Fanboij96: @Sinostra yes it dos
[3:00:55] Chazzmichael: I love the blackout proc when opened on by a rogue with touch of weakness 😀
[3:00:58] Sinostra: @Fanboij96 so the ring from bfd, or paranoia ccoming next phase
[3:01:03] Neverwind_: Starshards: prolly end of C tier or D tier imo, channel too much mana arcane dmg Berserking: Can be top C tier, there are ways to manipulate hp to make it effective
[3:01:12] grilledcheeseistasty: huamn worst race for lock
[3:03:01] Chazzmichael: Wich race would you pick based on this @hydramist
[3:03:06] Fanboij96: @Sinostra yes it will be soo good stealth is broken!
[3:03:14] OGWerm: Tap in game for a sec got some more shit for u @Hydramist
[3:03:31] pheneron: random question fam: do you use max rank renew in WSG, or just rank 1 to bounce PoM?
[3:03:32] Neverwind_: It's easy to pinpoint your spot in shadowmeld
[3:03:49] Nightbot: Follow Hydra's twitter! https://twitter.com/hydramist
[3:04:09] Nouse__: are you gonna get dusted often enough to justify the placement of will? sure its strong but compared how often it will get used compared to stoneform/fear ward
[3:04:12] Neverwind_: for a rogue is A for priest is meh :p
[3:04:37] grilledcheeseistasty: @Hydramist what runes do u wana see next patch? like from abilities in other xpacs
[3:05:18] Neverwind_: Seems perfect now
[3:06:26] Eavesdropz93: hell yeah good stuff

[3:06:55] pheneron: right on thanks!
[3:07:17] Eavesdropz93: no mana compared to fear ward but dang fw so strong..
[3:07:27] OGWerm: uber eats drive by

[3:11:19] Quentey: @Eavesdropz93 yes

[3:14:01] alexbilbaoo: I mean... GIGACHAD
[3:14:13] RamboSupreme: i thought theyre gona give all preists all access to racials? or am i wrong
[3:16:21] iitsAK: sounds solid dude
[3:16:23] grilledcheeseistasty: what u dont think devouring plague with shadow guard would be better as shadow?
[3:16:25] grilledcheeseistasty: like pvp wise
[3:16:32] Neverwind_: It's sick
[3:17:03] iitsAK: isnt plague on cd too
[3:17:05] iitsAK: like 2m
[3:17:48] Sinostra: i gotta take care of dinner now, can't bg sorry

[3:26:43] Zenro45: xD
[3:26:55] Neverwind_: and there was this rogue that took your name and made a rogue
[3:27:34] jvandervennet: yu
[3:27:56] jvandervennet: just make sure you loot baron for orb to spawn portal when you turn it in
[3:29:13] xbreezyysk: do u think we beat 2 rogues or is it an insta death?
[3:29:14] kolovratss123: You will be my ship on the stormy sea P2 and onwards!

[6:59:57] infamouz0815: so Ziqo sucks ?
[7:00:04] Sjura007: Cat with 2.0 attack speed is the best pve pet, wind serpent is better for pvp

[7:00:13] zum_no: no since zaiq pvps
[7:00:17] zum_no: ziq*
[7:00:20] Creoxx: 2.0 is good if you wanna melee weave

[7:01:27] Sjura007: In barrens, a raport is best. but get new rank of claw/bite
[7:02:15] dreeeamyy: PvE bis is ghost saber from dark shore but do that at 20
[7:02:26] dreeeamyy: if you melee weave

[7:07:09] DISLIKEABLEFULLCAPSNAME: darkshore kekw

[7:07:30] DISLIKEABLEFULLCAPSNAME: its easy to get
[7:07:56] zum_no: abit annoying, you need to find status on the ground and they have a chance to spawn a ghost cat
[7:07:57] DISLIKEABLEFULLCAPSNAME: spawn can be rng tho
[7:08:01] jvandervennet: best one to get as horde though is the white lion you get echuyache or somthing like that
[7:08:01] zum_no: took me 20 statues
[7:08:05] jvandervennet: horde specific quest
[7:08:10] DISLIKEABLEFULLCAPSNAME: took me 2 lol
[7:08:23] Prawlx: im gonna get pet soon, I first go boar?
[7:08:27] jvandervennet: its  1/10 ish, but you gotta find them which is the hard part
[7:08:39] jvandervennet: i think the white lion is better since its the quest anyways
[7:08:47] jvandervennet: same attack speed and horde specific
[7:08:50] jvandervennet: dang
[7:09:08] Prawlx: what can u tame him and do the quest?
[7:09:13] jvandervennet: yeah, but they level fast
[7:09:24] jvandervennet: ghost saber is cool but can be a grind. very rng
[7:09:38] blahownz: What server is this hunter on
[7:09:40] rickErikE: yes but not in the mid area
[7:09:40] Sinostra: guards don't give a  fuck

[7:15:19] blahownz: In pvp allot of dps
[7:15:41] jvandervennet: hardest hitting even if single target too
[7:16:03] zum_no: you 100% want a better swing timer that shows draw time also. need to melee weave and knowing when you can move and multi ect
[7:16:13] blahownz: I think i go walk to tb to get the buff then fly to crossroads
[7:16:24] jvandervennet: agree on the swing timer

[7:20:28] jvandervennet: you turned me from hunter to priest, so... its only fair
[7:20:32] PlayerOneFifty: Do you think it would be nice if they would make classic but in the reshaped world of cata? just to give the game a new feel?
[7:20:40] jarlike: Typical Huntard? :)
[7:20:43] vinsbarcelona: Hydra my man, first you left retail arenas cos classic arenas were supposedly better, but this isnt the case anymore, im sad you dont go back to retail arenas :(
[7:21:09] wowjunkie94: you should get a wind serpent

[7:24:42] Frig0z: retail world PvP is incomprehensible to me... so many weird procs, so many unknown weights
[7:25:29] vinsbarcelona: but in retail the best players are still the best, its not like bad players can luck out and win

[7:28:53] vinsbarcelona: cos hardcore players are the ones who cry and the ones who play retail over classic i think
[7:28:54] blahownz: Retail is kinda like new runescape vs old runescape and also retail is kinds so much shit happens starts to look more to chineese lvling games
[7:29:07] Alyxsandr: my friend plays retail until he rages out then he goes to classic until he rages out then he goes back to retail ect... lol
[7:29:08] TheNutcracka: well thats not completly fair since retail is evolving constantly while classic is the same forever

[7:57:54] Kraunx: But aimed does nothing
[7:58:08] scroteyx: just lets you do more burst
[7:58:08] Kraunx: It's less dmg than x2 auto shots which u can do in the same time frame as loading aimed
[7:58:16] Kraunx: its a waste
[7:58:18] Kraunx: of button
[7:58:34] dreeeamyy: you stay in touch with any of em?

[8:03:30] dreeeamyy: wind serpent Lightning is a spell so it resists alot vs higher mobs
[8:03:40] zum_no: you can have it off, but use it when you need to get aggro off you
