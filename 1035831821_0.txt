[13:17:03] findobin: @magebrainx The new ideal feral rotation is to setup a macro where you consume a Weak Troll’s Blood potion as you power shift, then cancel the aura 0.4 seconds after the initial tick to return 4 energy and allow two shreds per power shift. This means that every power shift you are consuming and cancelling a Weak Troll’s Blood to compensate for the resource update that severely nerfed feral’s rotation.
