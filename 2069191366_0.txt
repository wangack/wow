[3:23:27] ninetysix: good
[3:23:32] Chodie: finally got this goddamn rune
[3:23:39] Indomitablez: @Graycen Default UI
[3:23:47] bigbilly221: It does nothing except show mob HP

[3:23:51] grimmsrub: thats what it does
[3:23:55] Indomitablez: @Graycen Just adds health to you. You cant see target health its not active in the classic script
[3:24:04] imminent999: i know how to show ur targets cock

[3:25:39] ninetysix: ty for the raid graycen
[3:25:41] Indomitablez: @Graycen Blizzard took that script out of classic doesnt work anymore. Have to be in a party with them. You cant see Players health but you can see mob npc health. Also adds a threat % above the target frame so you dont need the threat meter
[3:25:45] lilbithomie: if you used tacotiop addon before you could set it and when you disable that addon it overrides blizzard cvars sometimes
[3:25:46] shinezlightz: big ticket grimes coming up

[8:35:27] miciahclay: plate armor value >>> leather, so its a trade off. Leather will always have slightly higher dps stats to compensate
[8:35:28] Chrisychris1: lol graycens viewers being min maxers
[8:35:30] Nnatey: PRE RAID BIS AT 60 IS A LEATHER EYE PATCH
[8:35:32] Nnatey: A EYE PATCH

[8:35:37] subsonic_eye: no me, but lots of people do
[8:35:43] FiberZ_: what if ur a healer? @Graycen
[8:35:46] stekarmalen: oooh, we do prio leather for leather users and once they are geared plate users can roll on leather
[8:35:48] wobven: pvp would be more fun if we had 300% hp and -50% heals
[8:35:48] cookie_jayy: I only raid to get BiS to destroy noobs in wpvp
[8:35:53] brjnoqo3kd: ima be back later i cant hear mconnels voice
[8:36:04] Nnatey: like stam is
[8:36:06] Nnatey: for real
[8:36:09] xelm_: it makes sense
[8:36:18] Nnatey: its so unimportant for a dps in PVE like wtf
[8:36:33] sircrumpler: P much yeah, cuz even feral loves str in vanilla
[8:36:46] xelm_: warrior doesnt even seem that good rn imo
[8:36:49] draqcula: they need to give plate agi and str
[8:36:51] Vell_x: Warr seems mid af
[8:36:52] xelm_: compared to majority of other classes
[8:36:52] dissarray595: ferals like str
[8:36:56] draqcula: like mail had agi and str in BFD
[8:36:57] cookie_jayy: Strngth is good for DRUIDS too

[8:37:28] ironb0rn: 30 seconds
[8:37:28] BingoTingler: i'm ok with phases fluctiating in balance; I just hope they do it right at 60
[8:37:29] Nnatey: BFD was plate for tanks and Gnomer is plate for shockadin its stupid
[8:37:31] Nikup: Blizzard is lazy
[8:37:31] Nnatey: as fuckkk
[8:37:35] scaff_24: theres 3 cloth sets
[8:37:37] Thedruidtyler: @Graycen new elden ring trailer in 1m going live

[8:37:42] ninetysix: bcs shockadin is a popular build
[8:37:42] Bamu3099: blizzard hates fun
[8:37:45] sircrumpler: I think they try to subtly bring warriors damage down by keeping it un-optimized and that affects ret a ton
[8:37:46] Nightbot: Follow my twitter for updates: https://twitter.com/graycen
[8:37:53] ayaooazz: blizzard is racist against ret pallies
[8:37:57] Nnatey: BFD = tank plate, Gnomer = Shocky plate like give ret SOMETHING plate
[8:38:02] dammitcyrus: Nah the plate would be better if it naturally had hit on it like the leather set
[8:38:03] Nnatey: so weird
[8:38:12] Vell_x: I'd even be fine if on plate there was STR/Stam and a low number of agi
[8:38:14] draqcula: @Nnatey even warriors dont benefit from plate but that blacksmith helm

[8:38:31] joshcheckers: as a war main, i think they should have had the plate with the same stats just weighted lower on agi and higher on str, stupid that leather is just purely more stats

[9:30:29] Reck179: The missile knows where it is at all times. It knows this because it knows where it isn't. By subtracting where it is from where it isn't, or where it isn't from where it is (whichever is greater), it obtains a difference, or deviation. The guidance subsystem uses deviations to generate corrective commands to drive the missile from a position where it is to a position where it isn't, and arriving at a position where it wasn't, it now is.
