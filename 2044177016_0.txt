[2:52:28] voodoodrop: ye thats a solution to have both runes
[2:53:00] saund: what if they implement 'dual rune' specialisation which costs gold instead of dual spec
[2:53:09] saund: and you sacrifice a whole other rune slot, to have two in one
[2:54:25] Sinostra: Are there that many meaninful rune choices in the game ?
[2:54:35] JavaSkrpt: Haven't looked at wars, do they have TG? At 40, fury dmg could be interesting if they did
