[0:55:05] dreeeamyy: and i guess its because they pump too much money into it compared to the rest
[0:55:13] goffy1993: where you from hydraa mate sound local to me

[3:22:37] prodigy_wow: @captainmundo if you absorb the lifedrain, it doesnt heal the lock. So you can PWS on the drain (or ideally right before) and dispel yourself while the bubble prevents the locks hp from going up.

[5:05:03] Skipiz852: but they did a post that they remove it before p2 no ?
[5:05:16] saund: you can go straight into sm library
[5:05:17] Kyfoon: how do you get 90 hand-ins worth when they are deleting marks?
[5:05:21] optik_rec0rds: 25 pre quests give you enough xp to get to 27.5

[5:07:08] flenbober: lol
[5:07:17] flenbober: thats a lot of marks XD
[5:07:21] optik_rec0rds: it also promotes degen behavior instead of farming them over a month
[5:07:23] isheria: i would not be surprised if they remove or lower the exp you get for the marks tbh
