[0:54:04] tigzie: its a scam OW 2
[0:54:05] shanks_blank: @Towelliee do you have to buy the game again ?
[0:54:09] superio29: yeah it is very lack laster
[0:54:14] TombStoneMercenary: woot $40 patch WOOT!
[0:54:16] JustJohn312: Could've been just an overhaul patch for Overwatch
[0:54:17] bypized: @Towelliee there is no way that they are selling the PVP
[0:54:23] FleuryGG: OW2 is a good example for everyone asking for WoW2
[0:54:27] Clicklesly: They made it 5v5 though Kappa
[0:54:31] Collected1: Lore said the same
[0:54:33] DiiscoViking: @TombStoneMercenary acurate
[0:54:41] superio29: and I thought wow content was bad that is even worse basically a patch
[0:54:41] TheCliffyShow: At least, you don't have to buy OW2 if you don't care about PvE or better graphics. All the other shit will be available on OW 1.
[0:54:46] dracullus: well it is patch for pvp side, I don't think you even have to buy O2
[0:54:58] Zettabyte: Other people again says it's a completly different game @Towelliee (i'm not in the beta (yet) *sulks*)
[0:55:07] Dyriks: better not be a $60 patch
[0:55:07] Palinore: Yeah.. With what comes with OW2 it could’ve just been a big patch/update……
[0:55:27] bypized: @Towelliee when are we getting a HOTS revival? Is Blizzard going to tank it to the grave?
[0:55:34] TheCliffyShow: I think a WoW 2 would be drastically different then the first WoW. WoW is 18 years old. OW is only, what, like 5 or 6.
[0:55:45] TombStoneMercenary: @Towelliee How is the combat performance in OW2 any better or worse?
[0:55:48] shanks_blank: do you have to buy OW 2 if you have OW ?
[0:55:51] superio29: @Towelliee kind of like destiny would be cool but not make a character

[1:42:29] HaxzorJimDuggan: too many ralphs
[1:42:29] stabzmcgeee: we should have a vote to leave button and if the group says yes then key level doenst drop but if everyone says no then someone leaves they get deserter debuff
[1:42:30] georgedavies1996: are you a fan of Taliesin?
[1:42:31] ZAVHALLA: M+ should have punishment for leavers!
[1:42:40] CrispyZenn: @Slick2StyleGaming i started playing in shadowlands and im running 16's now so you can def do it
[1:42:48] axdreamwalker: @towelliee advice for prot palli trying to build up to high level m+ after taking a break for a few months?
[1:43:03] JediNeo99999: @stabzmcgeee What if someone trolls the group voting no?
[1:43:10] TacDuc: In my experience as a tank player, people will try to fuck you over, was running a +15 at some point, and a warrior just pulled pretty much the whole dungeon and then left
[1:43:11] Stormin27: He was doing well too
[1:43:12] skymercii: what time is the interview in CST? simplSIP
[1:43:25] ObsidianHealer: @bloodyreapr 11am

[1:43:49] Rictamar: its embarrassing
[1:43:53] Niksen_99: Would it work if someone DC it would add more time to complete the key
[1:44:05] skymercii: also FFXIV if you are the first one to leave you get hit with a 30 minute penalty
[1:44:13] Rictamar: ^^^^
[1:44:24] ObsidianHealer: @bloodyreapr no prob, pst is 2 hours behind cst laynaPeek
[1:44:35] Kisswani: it's not M+ LUL
[1:44:40] JediNeo99999: That just promotes someone to sit afk so they aren't the first to leave
[1:44:45] ribzrulezdood: lol ff is soooo bad
[1:44:48] Rictamar: true, but the toxicity in pugging in WoW vs FFXIV is night and day
[1:44:49] CrispyZenn: @Niksen_99 nah bc it might be the healer or tank who leaves and then theres no chance of finishing

[1:45:57] Rambnesia: MY alts are so annoying to play when they are missing random things
[1:45:57] Velashen: It just proves the systems need to be changed to circumvent toxicity.
[1:46:05] Zettabyte: World Wide ;)
[1:46:05] Kisswani: Yeah that was my submitted question , especially account wide dragon riding progress and customization
[1:46:11] amricatt: Have they announced that anything will be account wide?
[1:46:28] PepeTheFeelsGoodFrog: agreed wow is worse
[1:46:31] SmallzzIV: They are so worried about people spending time playing... but if it's account wide people will probably make more Alts or... just spend more time doing stuff they actually like.
[1:46:33] Llamatude: give us a trainer that lets us swap our classes like the COV system.. but your level is based on the class not the toon..
[1:46:37] amricatt: Okay.  I haven't caught up after the weekend.

[1:46:46] TheCliffyShow: Account-wide bank!
[1:46:47] stabzmcgeee: with how much they seem to be taken on board player feedback i think we will see alot more account wide stuff
[1:46:53] HaxzorJimDuggan: and people think that not having LFD in wotlk is gonna reduce toxicity, look at what happens in M+
[1:46:58] Rictamar: at least there shouldn't be all these chores, which will help, but its going to be annoying coming from FF to repeat shit you shouldn't have to
[1:47:01] TacDuc: I just want to be able to do the rep stuff on other characters if I've already have it unlocked on one
[1:47:04] desmo7: twitter Elon interview? PogChamp
[1:47:10] Deadcells: My girlfriend always tries pugging keys and always gets harassed because she is new to the game. It’s so hard to get people into this game due to the community
[1:47:32] Kisswani: KEKW
[1:47:40] Leemann9: @deadcells keys are not for peeps new to the game.
[1:47:43] theSalute: @Deadcells yeah I dont get the mentality of wow players that think everyone should know everything by now
[1:47:46] vic_ave: Elon should buy Microsoft/blizzard
[1:47:46] mewkittymon: I have people bail on a M+2
[1:48:17] GamerGoat56: @vicava12 YEP
[1:48:26] amricatt: @scoped71 and why not?  New people want to do keys. How else are they supposed to get practice?
[1:48:32] stabzmcgeee: @Deadcells we took a new guildie priest who had the same issue and he turned out to be fuckinginsane at keys once he had the chance to stress less and learn
[1:48:33] Urebaldd: Problem is a lot of people sp
[1:48:37] onybear: I wanted to get into M+ and raiding when I came back but people have made that dang near impossible
[1:48:54] lilwaldo: What dungeon is this? It's been a minute since I have played.
[1:48:59] Leemann9: ty Towilee
[1:49:02] stabzmcgeee: anything upto +10 is learning keys imo
[1:49:06] vic_ave: gambit
[1:49:25] CrispyZenn: @lilwaldo its new its called tazavesh streets
[1:49:28] Kisswani: @stabzmcgeee which is why they shouldn't have timers imo . learn the affixes , take it easy
[1:49:30] Fangy_Playz: I miss running Keys with Terry
[1:49:42] TacDuc: *Cries*
[1:49:42] MrNefarious1: an d thats the prob right there
[1:49:49] Rictamar: yeh you need to know what you are getting into, its a high barrier to entry, especially for tanks
[1:49:51] Scoodles91: i've been asked for a 4 set for 11 :D
[1:49:51] Deadcells: Yea true
[1:49:53] Shadowlemur01: exactly why i dont run keys. Would rather just do 2s or rbgs
[1:49:54] skorchhx: yea we'll 2 chest a 10 and somehow people are still upset with a route or something
[1:50:08] ZabberzTV: yeah timed my first 19 dos this morning with guild
[1:50:09] Deadcells: I should tell her to stop pugging keys
[1:50:11] Shadowlemur01: @Scoodles91 KEKW
[1:50:12] Awwshifty: Oddly enough you see a lot of ppl leave lower keys on my alts too
[1:50:30] Deadcells: She doesn’t understand how to use tranquil shot and I don’t play hunter so I can’t explain it to her
[1:50:31] stabzmcgeee: @Kisswani or at the very least not deplete but no timers would be ideal agreed
[1:50:42] JediNeo99999: It's not bad if you work up key levels but people think they're the best and want to jump into +10s or higher instead of working up
[1:50:45] CrispyZenn: yea pple leave low keys all the time
[1:50:52] Hupu_a: did 3k require all dungeons at +21 at time or what was it
[1:50:58] Niksen_99: LUL
[1:50:59] h_u_r_k_: LUL
[1:51:04] Velashen: it’s just not very accessible as a system overall. By design it is toxic as well.
[1:51:07] newkingcody: KEKW
[1:51:07] CrispyZenn: that literally happened to me the other day. we were gonna 2 chest and the first wipe someone left

[1:51:23] smashwow: echo has lost 4 times i'll have you know Kappa
[1:51:27] ZAVHALLA: Timed out keys dont even hurt your io score, so i really dont understand the leaver mentality
[1:51:29] Spacebark: @Velashen Agreed
[1:51:48] IianaDRK: theres literally 15-20+ levels of difficulty. how is it not accessible
[1:51:52] gooni_coyg: @ZAVHALLA it gives more to time it
[1:51:56] Bacanu34: is more easy to get in a m+ then a normal raid KEKW
[1:51:59] Slimdaddy729: Slimdaddy729 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 9 months! 
[1:52:02] newkingcody: ppl who leave keys are babies
[1:52:07] Rictamar: if you mean *literally* accessible then yes, but that isn't what Velashen is saying
[1:52:13] ZAVHALLA: @ZAVHALLA Im not sure if i understand what you mean.
[1:52:13] KaptnG: Not if your alliance
[1:52:20] CrispyZenn: @ZAVHALLA yea and you still get gear at and and in vault. really makes no sense
[1:52:33] newkingcody: horde has like 50% more keys at any given time
[1:52:38] CrispyZenn: if anything leavers should have a penalty on their IO
[1:52:44] stabzmcgeee: i mean im guilty of leaving keys,,, when you are at the 1st boss 30mins in because the tank clearly cant handle it then fuck yeah im leaving
[1:52:53] cerealkillas22: Cause there are more horde players
[1:52:56] ZAVHALLA: @Laxsis Precisely, they really need to create a penalty for leavers.
[1:52:59] Leemann9: @stabzmcgeee true
[1:53:06] IianaDRK: when cross faction grouping comes in u cant use that excuse of "but alliance have less players" anymore
[1:53:16] mewkittymon: This week is to do 4 m+s as well
[1:53:21] ZAVHALLA: @stabzmcgeee You just fuk other ppls keys then.
[1:53:29] newkingcody: as an alliance main im looking forward to cross faction so i have more ppl to group with
[1:53:30] Hupu_a: ppl who leave keys should get penalty to their m+ score
[1:53:39] Ariea_Whisper: You can always run your own key and pick your own group so yeah I think it’s plenty accessible imo
[1:53:47] ZAVHALLA: @IianaDRK Yeee, as an alliance player, Im glad about cross faction
[1:53:59] Leemann9: @zavhalla the key is fucked if the Tank sux. what are yiu on?
[1:54:09] IianaDRK: @IianaDRK as a horde player i too am glad. its gonna be great to just have a bigger player pool for everyone
[1:54:09] mrniceguy817: I mean it depends on the title of the key I join if it says for completion and I queue I’m staying if it’s timing and we have 25 deaths before first boss yea I’m prob out
[1:54:12] ventu105: Morning @Towelliee and Chat
[1:54:14] ZAVHALLA: @windi_ yess
[1:54:19] skorchhx: people dont want to push their own key and expect to get picked from the pool of 100s of dps players
[1:54:26] IianaDRK: and itll mean us hordies can laugh at gnomes as well
[1:54:32] newkingcody: overwatch 2 beta hype
[1:54:36] newkingcody: poggers
[1:54:44] stabzmcgeee: @ZAVHALLA theres gotta be a middle ground to it tho,, cos at some point its simply not doable and expecting people to stay in your key for 2hrs is also not ok
[1:54:46] IianaDRK: @needaplug overwatch 1.5 u mean

[1:55:31] Leemann9: i have a 3 tank wipe rule for keys. after the 3rd wipe caused by the tank and i dip.
[1:55:34] pereadin: dps is really low in the group
[1:55:43] Shadowlemur01: what dungeon is this?
[1:55:43] ZAVHALLA: @stabzmcgeee I agree.. After a given time the penalty would no  longer apply or something

[1:56:20] Sollice: Maybe the people in your group are subbed and they dont see adds either
[1:56:25] stabzmcgeee: @ZAVHALLA thats why its hard for blizz to find an answer for it because its not always as simple as "everyone who leaves is a dick"

[3:01:27] nyro____: Yeah brawlers guild was actually fun
[3:01:30] Tokies: what if they bring the brawlers guild with the last season of shadowlands though?
[3:01:33] FostBros: enhance shamen is super fun

[3:01:38] Shrenko: isnt shadow crap now?
[3:01:41] Deadcells: Good choice
[3:01:42] plebstertv: Towellie if someone hasnt played in over a year, is it hard to get some okay gear when they come back so that their character is actually playable?  Sorry for the long question
[3:01:45] Niksen_99: Chadbomb????? D:
[3:01:47] Deadcells: No shadow ST is amazing
[3:01:51] CaffinatedCoffee: I have a 22 Spires
[3:01:53] gregl__: @Korupcija_ ya or less but it still has rough damage/healing reqs compared to the nerfed version of everything now
[3:02:05] Mecabeast: you decide which toon is getting scrapped for the new evoker?
[3:02:13] FostBros: @plebstertv if you do the new campaign in zereth mortis it provides some good gear upgrades

[3:03:15] DegenerateHaven: or jsut have normal and heroic like back in the day
[3:03:26] Colt_Engineer: ToP is better than DoS this week

[3:07:41] NickLeonhearth: every new class thats ever camo out, had a tank spec, one time they dont...
[3:07:46] fistofnature: !vault
[3:07:54] Logabrick: I mean they mention Evoker uses powers of all 5 dragonflights, but they never mention Black dragon flight on the 2 specs, perfect tank dragonflight is black
[3:08:00] Sollice: Yea but wearing dragon scale armor on a dragonkin wouldnt that be like wearing human flesh armor on a human?
[3:08:14] Kindr1d: doesn't unity go on helm
[3:08:19] drantee: what do you think the disadvantage would be if they had a tank spec for it?
[3:08:24] Kindr1d: eventually for brm
[3:08:28] Colt_Engineer: @Kindr1d goes on wherever you want it
[3:08:42] DatHuntard: @Sollice They already wear mail though. The will have scale armor lol
[3:08:51] LajsHimself: If they changed appearance, depending on each spec. Maybe color aswell. Would be cool

[3:09:37] Kindr1d: idk i got 50% crit on brm. brittle build baby
[3:09:45] Kahoolo: I think Shaman should get a tank spec. Would be dope. Tanking as Enhance in classic was fun lol
[3:09:51] Colt_Engineer: a hole 50 dps? how will you sleep at night?
[3:09:51] Moobot: towHAMUP Follow Towelliee on twitter so you can be in the know at all times! | twitter.com/towelthetank towKawaii

[3:10:30] garmin1987: i think paladin needs a proper dps spec
[3:10:31] cdk058: i want a big beefy dragon tank
[3:10:31] FostBros: i just want my 2h shammy
[3:10:34] ArcaneSyntax: Shaman can get a tank spec but they better not axe enhancement for it.
[3:10:51] Colt_Engineer: @Armdel lol
[3:11:01] Tokies: I love if earth sham tank when they are weak they melt out of earth for into normal sham. like cracking them out of their earth
[3:11:22] stresstest: Evoker will get a tank 3rd spec before shammy gets a tank 4th spec

[3:12:32] FleuryGG: "sorry babe, gotta clear this  m+  first,  sit tight"
[3:12:32] Haineji: @Towelliee  it would be cool if we can unlock the tank spec with some storyline from wrathion restoring the black dragonflight maybe 10.1 or 10.0.5 so they can have enought time to work on the spec
[3:12:37] Fangy_Playz: Key first wife later

[3:26:56] im_n0t_jezus: i hope they make it fun, since only content until DF would be 9.2.5
[3:27:05] Deadcells: @ohnother is it really?
[3:27:14] Rictamar: left at the start of 9.1, I won't come back until much closer to Dragonflight to level my chars from 50-60
[3:27:22] ClayMatioNation: @vireosgaming how are you liking it so far? I find it has a bit more directions and loads more to it than pre-9.2
[3:27:58] skymercii: how is the catch up rn? I left when SoD was released
[3:28:06] ContraRob: I love that Zereth Mortis really feels optional, especially after reverred and unlocking the memory.

[3:29:19] vireosgaming: @ClayMatioNation oh i definitely can, i do it every day tbh
[3:29:20] NickLeonhearth: I loved spine not because the fight was good, but because it was easy to go on Vent and when some1 falls say..."aaaaand bye byeeee"
[3:29:21] Mecabeast: get some updated warglaives of azinoth kekw
[3:29:22] CritcobainTV: @bloodyreapr I think you'd only have to do it once KEKW

[3:33:40] vireosgaming: @ClayMatioNation i will look into that for sure, thank you
[3:34:03] myguyhood: @mrniceguy817 everythign is disabled inside mt
[3:34:16] ClayMatioNation: Anytime @vireosgaming GlitchCat  Us casuals gotta stick together LUL
[3:34:31] vireosgaming: i love touch of death
[3:34:36] vireosgaming: @ClayMatioNation yeah XD
[3:34:38] moerkoffie1980: what interview you talking about? pls help
[3:34:39] mrniceguy817: @myguyhood Why’s that?
[3:34:40] Arocian: I wonder if they'll have a new dungeon like torghast in dragonflight?
[3:34:48] TweektheProphet: how long you think it will be before we see our 1st talent tree calculator for dragonflight
[3:35:14] Rictamar: or it drops tomes you can use to buy relevant gear
[3:35:17] myguyhood: @mrniceguy817 not sure tbh, covenant stuff is also disabled
[3:35:18] Rictamar: that would be pog
[3:35:52] mrniceguy817: @myguyhood Ohhh your saying the set bonus and Lego affects aren’t active
[3:36:13] mrniceguy817: I thought you meant like the mt was turned off as a whole
[3:36:15] vireosgaming: @Gylduran not necessarily gear, but it does drop tomes for a mount if it doesn't drop
[3:36:18] thebakeriscomingforu: Another issue with Timewalking is that the "borrowed power" mechanic of that expansion is no longer available, changes the experience.
[3:36:30] herpderpdoublederp: will you be listening in to the twitter interview on here?
[3:36:31] Rictamar: @vireosgaming indeed, that is awesome
[3:36:32] lannimite: Towelliee the monk?
[3:36:46] wEiRdO_dUdE: I had the idea years ago that old raid bosses could drop a new bag of goodies with current gear and augment runes, it can't be too hard to do
[3:37:01] ArcaneSyntax: they put a cap on tomes and there are easier ways to cap tomes than to run old hard raids.
[3:37:14] gregl__: I think making old dungeons relevant for gear is fine but raids is a bad idea
[3:37:29] TacticalWee: Hugglethemuggle subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 29 months! 
[3:37:32] GusherTV: @Towelliee I havent played since Castle Nathria, how hard would it be for me to get into current raid content?
[3:37:45] SilkeySmooth: if you didnt like old raids relevent in ff they why would you like them in 9.2.5?
[3:38:09] vireosgaming: @gregltv there would probably be meta raids to do then at that point if it did drop relevant gear lol
[3:38:29] myguyhood: @GusherTV if you do ZM quests you can buy 226 BoE's, or you can just buy 236 BoE's from AH which will put you in line with LFR and m0's
[3:39:08] ArcaneSyntax: @silkeysmooth not every raid is going to be relevant all at once, it's gonna cycle week to week.
[3:39:23] vireosgaming: what is the achievement for ZM flying?
[3:39:34] myguyhood: @vireosgaming unlock the secrets
[3:39:35] dimofodi: Yea ZM questing rewards 233 minimum and the 229 boe's drop like crazy so you could be in LFR/normal within a couple days.
[3:39:46] Colt_Engineer: I love when people who don't have ZM flying asking for people to fly them, I'm like bro
[3:39:49] SilkeySmooth: @ArcaneSyntax not the point he jsut said he didnt like it in ff14 so why liek it in 9.2.5?
[3:39:50] ContraRob: PVP quest each week gives good trinkets for starting out
[3:39:52] Shrenko: REMOVE VALOR CAP 😡

[5:29:20] BloodxxMerchant: Scarlet would be a good 1
[5:29:21] Colt_Engineer: give me my Halls of Valor back
[5:29:25] Rottencoarse: SFK and DM was Cata @Towelliee
[5:30:01] DuhCasual: NEW CONTENT PLEASE! I'd play classic for nostalgia
[5:30:26] Bennodkk: if they are set on doing this old dungeon m+ style atleast do smth so we dont have to travel to every dungeon location for the old ones
[5:30:31] Tokies: I wonder if sloot is bringing back his weak auras for dragon flight
[5:30:40] toobaked1987: Because everyone else is afk autoattacking
[5:30:48] drewsky96: Lost city of Tol'vir screams M+ to me

[5:31:30] ArcaneMaki: God I hated Lost City of Tol'vir
[5:31:53] wEiRdO_dUdE: Yeah, great interview....it answered a number of big questions
[5:32:04] TheCliffyShow: Taliesin is probably in a corner crying because Ion said no Tuskarr.
[5:32:12] CritcobainTV: It seems like he just doesn't want any extra Fozzle tbh @Towelliee
[5:32:15] MetaalMeneer: the interview tomorrow is going to be better
[5:32:25] Kisswani: not sure I would like that . people would just spike the prices
[5:32:33] Zivs: profession instead of adding a new weird thing like the catalyst
[5:32:38] SilkeySmooth: work order for tier
[5:32:41] raldrik: thats what they want
[5:32:44] pereadin: Profession style tier crafting would be great lore though KEKW
[5:32:59] raldrik: you put your M+ item on a work order and get it updated to tier
[5:32:59] IianaDRK: i dont see them making tier sets craftable
[5:33:03] elderikp: He got to be glad he's getting tuskars
[5:33:04] raldrik: just sucks the delay with out it
[5:33:07] TheCliffyShow: Ion's troll answer was great thouhg.
[5:33:08] elderikp: to show up
[5:33:11] pex413: or make a 0.5 tier that is professions
[5:33:12] IianaDRK: if itll be like TBC then itll be off pieces that are crafted
[5:33:21] OGXanos: Ion hates tanks Kappa

[5:33:31] vic_ave: dungeon .5 tier sets were cool
[5:33:33] Fugazi811: superhell
[5:33:33] cazhually: this just energized me to do zereth mortis and keys
[5:33:35] Todmeister9000: SUPER HELL
[5:33:36] reggiepowa: it was a really good interview by Tali and some people were crying why is it not Asmon or Bellular doing the interview
[5:33:40] scudo13: I'd rather pay a blacksmith some gold to convert an item into tier than have the devs create a new arbitrary currency for it
[5:33:40] The_Tacozilla: I liked the "Foozle" thats gonna be my Dracthyr name now lol
[5:33:41] propwash80: @Towelliee do you think that shadowlands is ALT friendly?
[5:33:45] cazhually: they know it was poop
[5:33:53] 24sevn: will you be streaming on youtube? @Towelliee
[5:33:53] pavepawns: its not hell ITS SUPER
[5:33:56] cranjismcbasketball069: BFA leveling is better than Shadowlands honestly
[5:34:06] elderikp: BFA leveling is pretty dope
[5:34:10] elderikp: After you unlock flying
[5:34:27] bigoldmeatpie: BFA had a lot of problems but the leveling zones were easily the best part. they were all good
[5:34:42] Yagr6: if what blizz says is true about dragonflight then it may be the most alt friendly expansion ever
[5:34:43] Zivs: it's different when its your first time but yeah
[5:34:51] IianaDRK: dont need to revamp the SL new player experience if u have players skip it to dragonflight
[5:35:15] theDirtyon3: KEKW
[5:35:23] CritcobainTV: Have fun KEKW
[5:35:26] TheCliffyShow: When they annouced Shadowlands I was bummed it wasn't Dragon Isles. Now, I'm glad. Because it got turned into shit, and Dragon Isles can be awesome.
[5:35:32] feodin: SL is alt friendlier.. I still don’t feel like it’s alt friendly with all the other systems
[5:35:32] Molvonos: @Towelliee I just got home from work, read the interview and making popcorn for the shitshow that is 'No Tank Dracthyr' on MMO-C and Reddit.
[5:35:41] KingSlayerYotam: It seems for a new player, the goal is so far you give up trying to get to it
[5:35:52] 91Niki: monkaS
[5:35:58] Tokies: I agree with that. Also, world quest have such low ilvl when you first bring something in that doesn't have shadowlands. It's hard to do basic questing post gam after you hit 60
[5:36:00] alwayspresto: thats facts
[5:36:00] UlsterFarl: Need that Mixer money
[5:36:03] falldrgn: Mixer coming in outa knowhere
[5:36:07] 91Niki: No money could make me go stream on youtube with the chat over there
[5:36:09] gritbarontv: that's odd, i made a couple of new toons, was always able to start kortia, but you do have to finish covenant since they are tide
[5:36:21] vic_ave: didn't they close Mixer?
[5:36:34] Javiz: @91Niki what do you mean the chat there is so good Kappa
[5:36:34] SonofHorus82: lol "streaming on youtube" LUL LUL
[5:36:43] CritcobainTV: @gritbarontv That's not what hes talking about. He's talking on a fresh account who hasn't done anything in shadowlands
[5:36:48] Tokies: don't forget to get the collect boost to your first ones send from your main
[5:36:48] 91Niki: @Javiz A good dumpster fire yes
[5:36:50] balancedlight: whats not happening?
[5:36:51] Shirey36: the point we are at in wow a new class should offer all 3...dps/heal/tnak
[5:36:55] gritbarontv: ah got it
[5:37:07] Exxcar: @Javiz dcwPog
[5:37:19] Molvonos: @91Niki Dumpster fire while enjoying a fresh squeezed glass of trash juice.
[5:37:24] AlphasaurusRexx: we have plenty of tanks. people are going to magically play tank with one more.
[5:37:28] Tokies: true 9.2 is good
[5:37:28] Yagr6: lost opportunity, people need a reason to play tanks now adays
[5:37:31] balancedlight: @Towelliee what all is going to be account wide?
[5:37:35] 91Niki: @91Niki yes
[5:37:50] Exxcar: @Towelliee it definitely is SOUNDING good.... just need to see it translated into the actual game
[5:37:50] elderikp: But gearing is the fun part and not a chore
[5:38:00] Fugazi811: finally some love for ranged with hero class
[5:38:03] WOOPsWOOP: chat anonymity will be changing very soon I imagine
[5:38:05] killercondon: Said everything but gear i thought
[5:38:11] Collected1: i think they'll allow lower level gear to be shared
[5:38:16] Collected1: just not cutting edge stuff
[5:38:17] MILESkg21: finally a new healer since MOP EZ Clap
[5:38:20] Tokies: these rares get nuke now. they go down so freakin fast
[5:38:20] bigcountry555: i hope that prof will play a big part in gearsing too
[5:38:21] FostBros: did they go over like pre orders? i missed the last 30 min of the interview
[5:38:28] stabzmcgeee: @elderikp fucking true! let me skip crap on my alt and just go gear it
[5:38:31] Manabucho: hope dragonriding is account wide
[5:38:37] swordart2022: Asmon has interview tomorrow O_O
[5:38:37] Kisswani: @elderikp yeah , the best moment for me is usually getting an upgrade . even if it's like 1 ilvl
[5:38:38] cranjismcbasketball069: how much of the old ways were Ion and the other leadership and how much was people above him? @towelliee
[5:38:44] Exxcar: @Manateedk They already confirmed it is
[5:38:56] xmedpakx: man i hope they add more mount collection achievement rewards
[5:38:58] ZethliN: did you stop playing lost ark?
[5:39:09] Todmeister9000: improved Great Vault too, hopeful about that one
[5:39:14] Manabucho: @Exxcar PogChamp

[5:41:08] balancedlight: @Towelliee Ion said next expansion the dracthyr will have more classes
[5:41:14] uglla3np: 4 tiers? wtf
[5:41:28] Exxcar: Less time trying to fix the stacking systems, more time can be spent on content
[5:41:29] Todmeister9000: I just realized there was no 2-boss raid in SL
[5:41:34] Shirey36: ian saying dragons cant tank is mind boggling though...like the interviewer said all our tank gear comes from dragons LUL
[5:41:36] Kisswani: If their philosophy is to reduce the feeling of drought by playing more alts then I'm all for it
[5:41:36] MBG_95: if they dont have to do 4 entire covenant campaign stories, they should have time for more Main story content
[5:41:37] PvtHudson093: More mini raids please
[5:41:38] TheCliffyShow: They have alluded to Dracthyr possibly being other classes in the future. I'm guessing it won't be till the next expansion at the earliest.
[5:41:41] Exxcar: Last few expansions they spent so much time just fixing systems
[5:41:58] nephttv_: Look at legion, EN, NH, ToS, antorus plus a mini raid
[5:42:00] Yagr6: i hope with the removal of borrowed power now trinkets can be stronger/op @Towelliee
