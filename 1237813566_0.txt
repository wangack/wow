[1:09:30] yib_: moonfire
[1:09:31] pavepawns: i still dont get why they nerfed it for guardian cause i find it alot easier compared to pala tank
[1:09:41] pavepawns: tho they did nerf pala too
[1:10:02] Masqerader: this imo is the problem with druid tanking challenge, you need to be boomkin to meet a dps check
[1:10:05] Kisswani: KEKW
[1:10:27] AureliusXV: nope
[1:10:31] happybooger: no boomy

[1:13:13] happybooger: i was at a 100 before the nerf, 2 shotted it after the nerfs
[1:13:44] pavepawns: i did it 8 hours or 7 before nerfs came live so i was little overhappy with myself
[1:14:29] trevt6: id consistently get him to the 4th annialation and just not have enough dps
[1:15:14] pavepawns: i ended up going potion in 2nd phase cause i knew i could deal with 1st phase with only 1-2 infernals safelyt

[1:44:58] Kisswani: Power gain rewards you for playing the game , that's it's biggest advantage
[1:45:26] ManneehFresh: The Maw makes me not want to log in
[1:45:27] hoodvoker: @ZangetsuVMG I dont mean that there is nothing wrong with that.  I mean the power gains / methods arent enjoyable
[1:45:38] crawcook: The game needs more things Mage Tower, then the grinding and chores wouldn't be that bad.
[1:45:45] Storm0118: i just dont understand the daily login mentality when the revenue is monthly(to an extent). Just need to make sure there is progression happening every 3-4ish weeks
[1:45:50] AureliusXV: yeah but thats what eveyone WAN TED

[1:46:03] LitChameleon: Thinking about getting back into WoW, is this a bad time to start the grind?
[1:46:17] zauriel_l: And why it's bad?
[1:47:04] ZangetsuVMG: @crawcook mage tower right now is so bad because when it was made we had other systems (legendaries and artifact weapons) that made it enjoyable, right now you just need to exploit early and a lot to get it done
[1:47:05] Folgrum: make all quests repetable ? they would work like world Q

[1:47:48] AureliusXV: cant wait till shards are gone , switched to pally for mythic slv and i have to wear heroic gear lmao
[1:47:58] Celestia6: I would love a new profession
[1:48:10] crawcook: @ZangetsuVMG yes, I am not saying the timewalking tower is the best version, but the Legion one was the right direction, you could grind to get more powerful and make the tower easier, that is where I think the daily grind makes sense.
[1:48:33] Kisswani: Ulduar POGGERS
[1:49:16] ZangetsuVMG: @crawcook exactly, either that or make it that from when it's created it's not dependant on any system
[1:49:34] SaDos: free?? haha you are joking right?

[1:52:06] malmusdon: Jesus thats a lot of attempts I got mine after 205
[1:52:13] ironforge_1337: this generation is full of virtue-signaling snowflakes who can be overly dramatic
[1:52:16] metavahn231: average WoW player that never raids: "Just take everything out of the game and only have mythic raids"
[1:52:23] AureliusXV: you think the gaming industry is the only one??
[1:52:32] Vramii: People still use google, facebook, Apple and they are all rotten too
[1:52:37] Vramii: It’s just the reality of the world
[1:52:42] BQAD: @Towelliee you know why i keep playing wow, even tho I think its in a bad state? Im too lazy to start some new game and learn everything again. I dont have WoW, its just the same old mistakes. it gets old fast.

[1:53:26] ironforge_1337: when people are coddled while growing up and then have safe spaces and get into the real world, they're a little shocked
[1:53:30] crawcook: @Vramii the difference is that in FAANG devs get treated well. LUL
[1:53:30] Molvonos: Stealing breastmilk to mix with their crack.
[1:53:32] Frank4LuLz: cocaine is OK
[1:53:36] Alienfromger: you have to learn how to leave a compfort zone
[1:53:52] Frank4LuLz: sniffing ass's is OK

[1:54:06] LitChameleon: lol
[1:54:07] metavahn231: WoW is just too much of a meme now, start fresh in 10.0 without all these systems and time wasters

[1:54:18] Jokervenom1978: Frankly all the game companies are shitty so just play the games you want to.
[1:54:19] ZangetsuVMG: ofc most people don't give a shit, otherwise a lot of other companies that cater to a lot more people than any gaming company wouldn't exist anymore
[1:54:24] metavahn231: no one has time to "catch up" anymore in mmos
[1:54:25] spammer_123: The sexual harasment is a diferent thing..
[1:54:27] Molvonos: Blizzard trying to break the world record for snorting the longest rail of crack

[1:54:43] GiraffeHydra_: @Towelliee If I boycotted every company that did shit I disagreed with, I'd be living in a homemade tent in the forest
[1:54:47] crawcook: Yeah, I can understand the difference, but I was referring to the fact that in a way Blizzard was a shit company, just not the way the Twitter warriors are describing it. LUL

[2:20:38] Bayne77: tbh, if i am sitting here watching you, supporting you, i WANT you to make money, i WANT you to succeed.
[2:20:39] Jokervenom1978: Its actually highly ethical to be that transparent.
[2:20:41] Molvonos: You absolutely should talk about money, not to show off, but so people who might be getting shafted have a better understanding of their worth.

[2:23:38] CrunkyBrewster: Hell yeah
[2:23:39] Sneekzx: You determine your worth. If you're only making $10/hr its probably because you only think you're worth that much. Set goals, and achieve them.

[2:59:00] TheGiant99: Im gonna try Sorc on weds in RU
[2:59:11] Doctor_Skel: yea more content etc
[2:59:25] Doctor_Skel: I am saying if you compared content and activities across the board in WoW vs FF14, for every one activity in WoW there is 10 in FF14. So when a "mage tower" activity comes out and people get excited.. if you think about it, they shouldn't be so excited because they are really not getting the amount of content they deserve
[2:59:53] theDirtyon3: Bruh LUL
[2:59:55] CAPT_Crack: lol
[2:59:55] HaxzorJimDuggan: palace of the dead gives a unique title if you solo it
[3:00:07] theDirtyon3: FF andys over here
[3:00:12] metavahn231: ffxiv has less content but the sync system is so well it feels like more
[3:00:12] TheGiant99: Once again people always gotta pit one game agaionst the other
[3:00:21] ironforge_1337: WoW is still on top, and people LOVE to hate whatever is on top
[3:00:28] Bayne77: for every 1 line of dialog in wow there is 10 in FF Kappa
[3:00:31] Doctor_Skel: I dont hate WoW dont get me wrong
[3:00:34] dawshua: @Doctor_Skel Its all relative my man there is a difference between content and good content?
[3:01:00] wEiRdO_dUdE: If WoW made alll old content viable, they would be similar games in terms of quantity
[3:01:19] GiraffeHydra_: I think there are some hardmode dungeons in FF14, but not many
[3:01:34] Kromede: cat girls > all
[3:01:38] dawshua: @GiraffeHydra Nothing you can compare with M+
[3:02:02] GiraffeHydra_: @dawshua oh no, certainly not. Just saying it for accuracy
[3:02:11] boofeyy: M+ is the best dungeon system ive ever seen in an mmo, not much can compare to it at all
[3:02:15] dawshua: If FF14 had a mechanic like M+ damn..
[3:02:27] Doctor_Skel: lol
[3:02:27] Davalin: LUL
[3:02:29] Doctor_Skel: hot
[3:02:29] Bayne77: so they are exactly the same thing Kappa
[3:02:32] Nevindaz: KEKW

[3:02:44] flebbooo: yeah thats quite a stretch KEKW
[3:02:47] GiraffeHydra_: @Kromede both make good footballs
[3:02:47] bhxkazzam1: i just cant stand ff14 ui. it so bad in my opinion
[3:03:14] Cafe0le: a lot of people just play wow for arena, and ff doesnt appeal to them at all
[3:03:23] Kromede: RIFT Kreygasm
[3:03:24] Snomase: I honestly don't know what to do at Max Level in FF14 outside of raids. Just fate grind or transmog grind?
[3:03:25] Doctor_Skel: Yea it was a little extreme a number my bad but I just feel like I have more to chew on in FF and it takes longer to achieve usually
[3:03:26] lolpetje: but we ff14 gold saucer LUL
[3:03:36] AureliusXV: bear tank challenge?
[3:03:37] MMOrpgPrincess: Rift
[3:03:39] dawshua: @Snomase Not sure, really

[3:04:51] happybooger: i got a lot of pet battles still to do lol
[3:05:15] boofeyy: i have  8 LOL
[3:05:27] Khoulwhip: Key point: IF you so choose to do it.  That's the problem, too many people don't do the extra stuff.
[3:05:43] kiaharii: 140/186 :)
[3:05:46] Hayon5: do you think the next expansion is about dragons ? maybe new dragon class , would be sick
[3:05:54] Snomase: I went from FF11 (5 years) to WoW (started at BC) to the launch of ff14 and then the relaunch of ff14. And honestly ff14 /wow feel the same. It all depends on who you play with lol
[3:06:25] MisterBongwater: arguably better
[3:06:27] Khoulwhip: True, people don't do the extra stuff in FF14 either.  There's a ton of stuff in BOTH games
[3:06:36] AureliusXV: got that red zone on
[3:06:38] CADZtv: tbh i prefer creating a new character

[3:07:59] soshiecho: no texans can still get #1
[3:08:03] Bayne77: tanking for who?  theres not a lot of difference in the top few players this year
[3:08:18] bhxkazzam1: Lol such a sad time for mmo then
[3:08:31] tankabito: if wow is doing just fine i'd hate to see dying
[3:08:37] Doctor_Skel: rip rift lol
[3:08:42] bhxkazzam1: @tankabito LOL

[3:09:07] Kromede: wait until gamigo has the best ever update for RIFT in 2022 MiniK
[3:09:07] luckfore: these people that keep saying xx is better than xx are just looking for validation
[3:09:15] CADZtv: like flatline dead
[3:09:16] TheGiant99: Ultima was awesome
[3:09:19] hessianaggression: wow has declined but I still wouldnt call it dead
[3:09:20] abracka_: when are we getting Classic WIldstar release?

[3:13:42] dalaraz: but first tier was fine
[3:13:44] AureliusXV: bucs back to back
[3:13:44] abracka_: at least with all of WoD's faults the story wasn't as bad as SL
[3:13:53] Complete_Phased: Wrath
[3:13:54] CADZtv: tbc was good for its time
[3:13:57] gh0vvst: JT MVP locked with three games left.
[3:13:59] Breakers__: Wrath>TBC

[3:14:12] Colt_Engineer: kinda of reminds me in high school when I had a girl over and I was watching the last airbender tv show and she said it's boring I kicked her out so fast
[3:14:13] gh0vvst: Cards Raids Jags
[3:14:15] Doctor_Skel: The only thing I didn't like about Legion was the fact that they killed my Boy Tirion
[3:14:24] Thasin22: What do you envision 10.0 to be?
[3:14:29] dalaraz: i find wod lore even more nonsense than shadowlands
[3:14:39] CADZtv: tbc was as good as vanilla for its time now..naaa

[3:15:02] Winttyrr: my favorite expac is either cata or legion
[3:15:05] TacoTime_Gaming: I liked shadowlands when it first came out. I enjoyed trying out torghast and did the mythic dungeon grind. Then I got bored and quit again.
[3:15:17] Colt_Engineer: yeah...sports....running....throwing balls....sure
[3:15:31] shadowstorm07: people who say classic and tbc was best are stuck in denial lich king and panda land best
[3:15:32] AureliusXV: bull shit
[3:15:39] AureliusXV: i remeber
[3:15:40] TacoTime_Gaming: Wow just has the issue of keeping me engaged.

[3:16:16] flebbooo: Unfortunate low roll LUL
[3:16:17] XshadowturkeyX: i was hype for shadowlands i played that hard until i heard about tbc and whent to prepare for that
[3:16:22] Zettabyte: Need a clown emote, @Towelliee Kappa
[3:16:32] abracka_: they've done the same shit since WoD. ignore all beta feedback, slowly implement beta feedback through the expansion cycle and just repeat it
[3:16:36] CADZtv: @XshadowturkeyX tbc KEKW
[3:16:37] 7point3: well lets pray for a better next one
[3:16:38] AureliusXV: everyone on beta was liking the shit out of the beta
[3:16:41] Nightshadre: yea you said 50/50 numerous fucking times during beta and alpha
[3:16:56] TacoTime_Gaming: I hate the daily grind of the covenant crap.

[3:17:13] Colt_Engineer: KEKW
[3:17:16] wEiRdO_dUdE: damn
[3:17:29] AureliusXV: can you get it out the pile of sand?
[3:17:38] 7point3: it is true though even did say they liked the xpac when it first came out.. the first 2 -3 weeks
[3:17:38] Noshpan: Unfortunate
[3:17:40] Breakers__: WoW sunk to a low when they brought Panda's to the game.
[3:17:40] Aidler: true. towelliee was skeptical at the start of SL… but he is a good dude and always gives the benefit of a doubt
[3:18:07] flebbooo: Its so unfortunate, i feel like SL has the gameplay just no content FeelsBadMan
[3:18:20] sinlesssinner: @Brevard_ MoP was a great expac tho :)
[3:18:20] XshadowturkeyX: yeah yeah laugh at me for tbc. even all my friends quit after getting bis from khara
[3:18:40] siszle: Good Morning Everyone
[3:18:48] Aidler: @sinlesssinner true
[3:18:50] AureliusXV: you asked for that though
[3:18:54] sinlesssinner: just like WoD, there was nothing else to do besides dung/raids
[3:19:00] AureliusXV: everyone didnt want the grind
[3:19:04] Colt_Engineer: how do we find our ark tho?
[3:19:09] ThorH13: what up
[3:19:13] wEiRdO_dUdE: Yeah there wasn't much complaints about Shadowlands raids once they fixed the loot scarcity
[3:19:17] sinlesssinner: they need to put more money into developement into World Content/quests and stuff like that
[3:19:22] AureliusXV: lmao
[3:19:24] Jokervenom1978: ya the less gear is what killed it for me.
[3:19:33] Ritchynadir: Personally i think Shadowlands comes close to the level of Wrath of the lich king
[3:19:35] bhxkazzam1: just run m+ to get gear, raid is a waste of time in sl
[3:19:39] Bayne77: Towelliee wanted NO GEAR from dungeons/raids Kappa
[3:19:45] Colt_Engineer: bfa grind was too much, legion grind was purrrrrfect
[3:19:51] AureliusXV: i know lolwasnt specially sayign you
[3:19:52] flebbooo: yeah that classic influense they had in early SL just did not work at all
[3:20:00] siszle: Don't forget to get your free items in New World
[3:20:01] theDirtyon3: Towelliee and THD were Pres and VP of the ggrind
[3:20:08] SamDavidsin: nah dog, green bay all the way
[3:20:08] CADZtv: im pretty certain most people hated the endless grind in bfa
[3:20:13] Hayon5: Blizzard need to make more hard mode dungeons like Tazavesh and put good loots in , M+ should only be for fun/rating/cosmetics
[3:20:37] duhworks: is this after sever merge
