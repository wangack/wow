[4:15:07] gorilahazed: is this a new genre
[4:15:08] notr3: my gf complains about that all the time
[4:15:11] Milano___: Google is always listening

[4:18:00] gooball_tv: pika good shit yesterday that's all I came to say have a goodnight
[4:18:01] llseattlell: so pika . i have spent a majority of my day compiling data and asking people theyre thoughts on everyone roasting you for not doing as much damage as trill or the other rogues etc. the conclusion? you control an arena trill just lives in it.
[4:18:03] guesswhofoo: tell him to run oblivion
[4:18:05] guesswhofoo: for the dmg
[4:18:10] TheTruBoz: Yeah, the R sham is doing as much dmg as the aff lock
[4:18:26] sgtstarfox: @llseattlell holeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
[4:18:30] da0tra: hello
[4:18:46] ChocoFrieEcho: or amp weakness healer so no crit heals
[4:18:55] llseattlell: you control every aspect of the arena in terms of utility. . while you arent hard focused on damage. you can multi cc chain an entire team. trill does not. utility will always be more viable then brute force. as you proved so well done brother well done.
[4:19:19] ChocoFrieEcho: it’s a curse
[4:19:32] johnulux: cause he went to war in Hacksaw Ridge but didn’t use a gun. they won the battle. he didn’t do any damage
[4:19:45] isharpsword: dam
[4:19:47] Talonin: Talonin subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 8 months! 
[4:19:57] anmusallam: damn didnt even let heal play his toon

[4:21:21] 69erbeastt: Great win this weekend! watching it was so stressful couldn’t imagine playing
[4:21:25] Kanooog: Pika is there a difference in SS Gear vs 3s Gear?
[4:21:35] MooKalti: Liquid max said "pika just oozes rizz" when your face cam was on during the final, I think you're in mate
[4:21:35] zen0vae: all quiet on the western front - amazing war movie
[4:21:36] Revan06a: Im clearly playing sub wrong, when i try and do damage it feels like im slapping people with a wet noodle
[4:22:03] OrbishGG: @mmarkerz i always hate that josh brolins character goes out like that
[4:22:06] coreysgametime: Who is the best Spider-Man?
[4:22:10] Kanooog: @Revan06a Look up some Macros

[4:22:20] WoWDontU: 2000;s rock playlist?
[4:22:22] the_bau5xx: the interpreter movie with Jake gyllenhall was pretty good
[4:22:25] ViDDVuun: Dont bother buddy
[4:22:29] llseattlell: well john. sheer power can never beat the power of human mind. while pika sits here and calculates a million moves a minute on how to be 10 steps ahead of his opponents trill gets in there face and smacks them. pika can have a corona in 1 hand a blunt in the other and use his elbow to play and i think that in itsself shows true skill and mastery of his class. its truely amazing to watch.
[4:22:31] jimbonni: cardio?
[4:22:36] lucki_val: @Pikabooirl  wait wym lucky bro just say you just won AWC

[4:23:15] SwiisH_Tv: ty?
[4:23:16] ViDDVuun: That is indeed, not the move
[4:23:17] Brenanners: cardio only helps if you can last longer than 10 seconds
[4:23:19] Ghosted365: @Pikabooirl cardio is good for heart durabillity :D
[4:23:20] jimbonni: GET ARMS LIKE ME evry week sex my man :)

[4:23:51] moistydank: dude im telling ya, just go to a bar on valentines day. so easy to meet someone and get lucky lol
[4:23:51] llseattlell: can confirm roxxybolts did say he would prefer you on a team over trill as the control you have . ven basically told everyone that said you're bad to 1v1 you and then tell him if you are bad cause you just won awc and they cant even apply with a team to the awc.
[4:23:53] pr0x365: So are the gas station Rhino pills xD
[4:24:03] renco_irl: are you 24 big dawg? @Pikabooirl
[4:24:04] jujujujp: @Pikabooirl welp
[4:24:05] Kanooog: @Brenanners IDK cardio might make them go faster though.
[4:24:05] kelfeno: "I can't play sub. I also don't play sub" lmao
[4:24:12] count_chocula4: Hey pika, you see that divorce rates and birth rates are dropping in the USA?
[4:24:16] Ghosted365: @Pikabooirl btw can you do a quick rotation/burst show off for the current build u are running
