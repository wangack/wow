[1:51:06] Holysal: he wasnt
[1:51:13] owlpoop11111: Even BGs and arenas, arenas aren’t faction vs faction so that doesn’t matter, and BGs just have people match the party leaders faction vis Mercenary system if necessary
[1:51:17] Masqerader: venture plan says on hiatus, so might not be getting updated for a bit i assume
[1:51:47] Mecabeast: I thought there were a bunch of community members doing updates for venture plan since the creator is on hiatus

[2:13:03] Holysal: @Malkyr wow
[2:13:20] soezdude4474: are there many gamers in EU?
[2:13:29] Malkyr: That seems crazy that EU has more subs than NA but I suppose it is possible.
[2:13:31] wowplaya4ever: not for me

[2:17:32] Malkyr: Kind of surprising there arent more big Russian raiding guilds considering the size of the country
[2:17:41] Prycey: if you include Brazil and other south American countries then US has more WoW subs than EU other was it doesn't
[2:17:49] lanara233: When Blizzard consider "EU" they might not mean it in a technical sense. They might mean it as an abbreviation of a continent
[2:19:15] lanara233: The Battlenet region of "Europe" includes Africa, for example
[2:19:59] Prycey: LUL
[2:20:44] Malkyr: Well it isnt worth putting server farms everywhere for sure. It is interesting stuff to think about that games companies have to consider this even

[2:59:35] VBTIGER89: Speaking of hard
[3:00:00] Sneekzx: I'd say its about equal, cause 75 viewers now isn't a lot but the competition is so much harder then back then! Before it was just getting people on the platform to watch said person, now if you're boring ppl will just go some where else (bigger streamers).
[3:00:01] ShamrockDAB: my step son is a variety streamer, he does pretty well with 1.5k viewers when he streams

[4:10:35] PokerFaceMoose: our druid tank last night was waiting to put barkskin on til nightbane landed and oops got 1 shot before he got into bear form
[4:11:18] ShamrockDAB: oof
[4:11:50] ShamrockDAB: i take .5% less damage than our pally tank now on nightbane on my druid
[4:12:31] Chiraakitteh: Yeah I almost never use barkskin except for questing, have more mitigation in bear form than barkskin gives. I will use it if I’m trying for a healer brez in a dungeon, but that’s it. And at that point, it’s probably a wipe anyway.
[4:12:49] PokerFaceMoose: our pally tank can do all other fights no problem, but our druid was so much easier to heal. the extra hp helps
