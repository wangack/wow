[1:27:17] Kyrrua: I love the guy saying "you guys are brain damaged" when the guy says hes gonna buy gold cuz he's lazy to farm it WHILE saying he likes raiding and pvp. Brother thinks gold is what gears you instead of actually doing the raid. >.<

[2:20:29] Molvonos: Eyoo
[2:20:41] Elijahss: That will speed up 25 to 40
[2:20:50] TheRonWeedsley: ill take it
[2:20:56] HaxzorJimDuggan: level up raid
[2:21:02] GodKingMuninn: Thats good cause we technically are losing 2 leveling dungeons in SoD

[2:29:39] nisuunlite: took them 6 years
[2:29:43] Pritamin: How they want to control this? huh?
[2:29:54] whiskytrix: gold bidding is not social in any way
[2:30:02] agathadv: GDKP is uncontrollable. There are tons of discords with GDKP schedules per day lol
[2:30:05] agathadv: they can't control that
[2:30:19] brain_wash: hilarious, Trade chat will be simultaneously elated and enraged, cant wait
[2:30:20] reggiepowa: that version of wow is also retail
[2:30:27] whiskytrix: they can control any exchange of gold for raid dropped gear
[2:30:33] belfastcl: @agathadv you underestimate how much some people hate gdkps
[2:30:40] Pritamin: maybe they mean an addon that is  allowed now?
[2:30:51] whiskytrix: porbably just disable gold trading in raid and disable raid loot trading outside raid
[2:30:57] colety14: !drops
[2:30:57] Moobot: @colety14 towLoot Grim Campfire Toy WATCH 4 HOURS! THE DROP FATHER towLoot Also toss a Prime Sub to the channel to support our DROPS/BAG STREAMS! https://www.twitch.tv/subs/towelliee towLoot
[2:30:59] reggiepowa: remove master loot, make loot personal loot and bam no more gdkps
[2:31:09] agathadv: @belfastcl I hate it, I am one of those, I beleive GDKP ruined WOTLK experience too
[2:31:13] aspiration89: @Pritamin No, they don't mean an addon. They mean no trading gold for gear in raids.
[2:31:25] serawrbear: just making it reportable will do more than enough
[2:31:35] Elijahss: @reggiepowa GDKP are not the problem though
[2:31:38] instant_savage: instant_savage subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 18 months! hammers up
[2:31:46] gfield2k: GDKP is ass
[2:31:56] reggiepowa: @reggiepowa I agree, let people play how they want to play doesn't impact me whatsoever
[2:31:59] Amarlian: I figure the next news blast will be with the PTR Datamining
[2:32:14] Sniper_Penguin: gaurantee there will still be GDKPs.. just organized outside WOW on Discords or something.
[2:32:17] Templexx: yoooo
[2:32:33] Niksen_99: Pay with gold on retail/wrath
[2:32:37] Wulfgrym: loot is tradeable its gonna happen
[2:32:43] brain_wash: ive never done a gdkp, never effected me, but folks are Rabid with their hate for it thats for sure
[2:32:50] Elijahss: people would just buy raid spots/drops with real money
[2:32:53] HaxzorJimDuggan: or just log off with the gear you bid up and laugh
[2:33:04] serawrbear: so you've never used the AH @brain_wash
[2:33:15] fatal_flaww: at that point skip buying the gold and just buy the loot outright
[2:33:16] MasqureMan: what is the benefit of gdkp over just doing regular loot rules?
[2:33:17] whiskytrix: gdkp leads to gold buying which leads to economy inflation. its the worst thing to happen to classic wow
[2:33:20] belfastcl: @brain_wash if you engaged with any aspect of the economy, it did affect you
[2:33:23] arthalie: I think it's just another one of those systems to remove it from the casual experience, going outside of game to schedule GDKP isnt going to be realistic outside of high level game play now
[2:33:38] aspiration89: @MasqureMan People buy a shit ton of gold to make sure they get the items they want
[2:33:43] serawrbear: @N3llee wrong
[2:33:43] brain_wash: @serawrbear i guess??
[2:33:45] closetn00b: the only thing i can think is you can only trade with guildies and bnet friends (with the same 3 days cd you have for gifting items)
[2:33:52] dannyis1337: more ninajs I bet
[2:33:55] Sniper_Penguin: they would havee to disable gold trading inside raids/instances, and make items soulbound the second you leave the raid/instance.. that way you could still ML
[2:33:59] reggiepowa: @MasqureMan you get gold if you dont need any items, you are basically exchanging skill for ogld
[2:34:00] serawrbear: every time anyone uses any part of the in game economy they are affected by GDKPs
[2:34:05] Niksen_99: I HATE farming gold in WoW and i love to raid... I like joining gdkp as a gold farm
[2:34:16] aspiration89: @serawrbear Yep
[2:34:23] teky0: oh yeah needing for others is going to be the next topic on reddit soon
[2:34:25] Elijahss: master loot is a winb
[2:34:33] serawrbear: @serawrbear glad to see the wow classic reputation is still going strong
[2:34:38] brain_wash: @belfastcl i guess??
[2:34:42] MasqureMan: if people choose to pay for wow to run around and troll, they’re silly
[2:34:52] purrfecto: masterloot now promotes ninja;ing though
[2:34:55] Irahh: and they gonna need EVERYTHING
[2:34:57] HaxzorJimDuggan: my guild group always does master loot if we bring a pug
[2:35:00] reggiepowa: @serawrbear they are affected by bots who generate gold, not by gdkps
[2:35:10] serawrbear: l m a o
[2:35:12] Lefty79: or just make it Personal Loot like they did for a while.
[2:35:16] serawrbear: and gdkps don't affect bots?
[2:35:19] serawrbear: they do
[2:35:20] Amarlian: Could they just make Need be soulbound?
[2:35:21] Pritamin: never even made it to raid during my SoD time, funny to hear ppl bitching about gdkp LUL
[2:35:25] Niksen_99: Yes they can
[2:35:32] LegendaryViewer: @reggiepowa correct. the problem is the botting.
[2:35:33] Alaquane: on group loot, but not Need before greed
[2:35:33] Molvonos: Yep
[2:35:34] Syllvn: There is 0 reason for the old Need/Greed to exist in classic
[2:35:45] serawrbear: @serawrbear don't be a gender assuming asshole please
[2:36:00] serawrbear: i said one thing, you made a your mom joke and now you're assuming
[2:36:06] purrfecto: well what about those that don't buy gold that enjoy gdkp?
[2:36:12] smashwow: this is on classic right?
[2:36:12] Moobot: https://twitter.com/towelthetank/status/1743035635030691892
[2:36:16] belfastcl: i think the most succesful gdkps will transition into carry groups, only the big whale gold buyers will manage
[2:36:25] LimpyMcGee1: Heres how i see it, deposit outside of raid, loot master keeping track of what is spent from each persons deposit. at end of run, deposit is returned minus gold spent on loot plus share of gold pile.
[2:36:28] serawrbear: thank you, i'm sorry
[2:36:28] nisuunlite: 100% the incel anger is gonna be real
[2:36:34] Wulfgrym: the gkdp group might just do that on purpose to make blizzard do that
[2:36:38] purrfecto: but gdkp is just like selling mythic mounts

[2:36:42] Niksen_99: gbid
[2:36:52] Molvonos: There is never anything wrong with having a discussion.  There is absolutely a problem with becoming insulting to defend your position.
[2:36:52] Elijahss: On retail you buy your timed key each week
[2:36:57] Alaquane: what's a gold sale rune?
[2:37:06] LegendaryViewer: So there is no point in removing GDKP.
[2:37:22] brain_wash: @LitFlip omg its happening in here, and it hasnt even happened yet lol
[2:37:25] Holysal: as long as I can still buy gold im good
[2:37:37] Alaquane: but they're also moving the advertising
[2:37:40] jinnchu: Reset is Thursday
[2:37:42] Mckhero: might lead to more gatekleeping wont it?
[2:37:51] Elijahss: @LegendaryViewer It should fix the AH prices being too high a bit imo
[2:38:02] reggiepowa: just let people play how they want to play, why are they trying to push guilds when people dont want to play with guilds
[2:38:04] Slitze: servers down soon i believe
[2:38:06] teky0: @Mckhero 100% it'll be even worse
[2:38:14] PhillyDilly18: @Towelliee don't servers go down soon?
[2:38:17] Wulfgrym: okay that is weird
[2:38:23] LegendaryViewer: @LegendaryViewer But if they tart selling runs, the demand for gold will still be high

[2:40:21] LBroadwater13: thank you again for streaming during this drop you make it so easy to get the drop. much appreciated
[2:40:27] arthalie: @towelliee is it going to be worth to stockpile completed quests to turn it after the new season?

[2:40:33] JoshuaTree6969: that’s tuff

[2:41:24] Theduskflyer: @Holysal its not terrible....still needs some work, but its getting there. d3 wasnt worth a shit till later in the seasons

[2:44:52] Sch1ey: I like affixes but i would like them to try to see. Maybe im wrong and affixes are less fun but id loke to try
[2:44:54] I_c_E_c_U_b_E: @Towelliee still remembering infested affix? Kappa
[2:44:55] aikopooh: knowing blizz they don't like "fun" stuff prob thats not coming
[2:44:56] subarUWUw: they should just enable all 3 tier sets into 1 set of gear since s4 is spouse to be fun

[2:45:35] arthalie: What if affixes worked like the choice system in torghast/superbloom abilities?
[2:45:50] Wcvechten: Prideful was dogshit lmao
[2:46:02] subarUWUw: bring back those robot once whit the big cdr
[2:46:14] warrenny: season 1 sl raid and m+ were awesome
[2:46:18] RocketMan23: encrypted was the best in SL
[2:46:30] Wcvechten: awakening
[2:46:32] zeitgeiz: hated prideful
[2:46:33] warrenny: @subaruwuw which was that?
[2:46:34] FresheFefe: bfa
[2:46:59] zeitgeiz: I liked the last two  in shadowlands and the last one in BFA. reaping had fun times as well.
[2:46:59] subarUWUw: some season in shadowlands
[2:47:02] RocketMan23: invis+super speed
[2:47:02] lithium364: reaping pog
[2:47:04] reggiepowa: invisibilty
[2:47:20] ronny_84: i liked the S1 one, thundering i think it was called
[2:47:23] Mozzeyy_: this is some cyberpunk music
[2:47:29] warrenny: #
[2:47:31] CDubTheRIPper: I ended buying a hobby box of panini certified monkaS my first box lol
[2:47:47] warrenny: @subaruwuw the torghast power one?
[2:48:02] falldrgn: He said Wildstar.. to soon.. reeee
[2:48:18] subarUWUw: @warrenny no there was a mythic+ season with robots they gave fat cdr
[2:48:40] smokingcactus: yeah i like the idea of being able to choose your affixes like at the beginning of a dungeon but i just feel everyone will take the easiest all the time
[2:49:18] PadidinJones: Time to touch snow....
[2:49:46] ryano23: It's the quest you get in Loch Modan to go to Wetlands
[2:50:14] Curleaf: Are you missing runes for this guy? Or just the healing ones?
[2:50:18] smokingcactus: oo hotfixes lol 2
[2:51:12] mizerboy: @Towelliee  - Art of Samwise Thunderfury. Is $6.29 a good price to buy it at in your opinion?
[2:51:15] Kalakinz: Hey hey :)
[2:51:21] lostrealist: if their goal is to keep BFD relevant it would need to be at least 1 lvl per run. maybe up to 30
[2:51:23] purrfecto: @Towelliee are you doing any ally bfds after reset?
[2:51:31] Curleaf: I like your idea of hoping the gold grind one is available at a vendor in P2
[2:53:11] 91Niki: Sup Towelliee and chat towHi
[2:53:15] HaxzorJimDuggan: just hope its easy arathi basin rep

[2:53:30] Moobot: https://twitter.com/towelthetank/status/1743035635030691892
[2:53:51] zeitgeiz: gold cost in classic wow games is the biggest deterrent for me playing. I just hate questing/grinding gold just to play the game
[2:54:37] reggiepowa: unless they implement a token
[2:55:01] LimpyMcGee1: i have 50g between all my sod toons
[2:55:38] zeitgeiz: like “I wanna respec for a dungeon or pvp but I can’t afford to respec” is just not fun. too used to retail freedom lol
[2:56:03] RandomDadGuy: I have 50g total…
[2:56:03] Moobot:  Help Towelliee reach the 1,000,000 followers goal. Click that heart button and join the Hammer Squad community!
[2:56:05] reggiepowa: gdkps are a good way to make gold for those who just want to play
[2:56:18] OGaxelaw: i made my classic gold off mining and herb esspecially black lotus farming
[2:56:30] reggiepowa: LUL
[2:56:31] Curleaf: Yeah, I still have some of my War abilities on layaway.
[2:56:31] 91Niki: aaaaand banned
[2:56:37] Mozzeyy_: dual spec deff should be a thing
[2:56:37] Amarlian: They did say that not every QOL in game has been mentioned so there is hope
[2:56:39] GodKingMuninn: I'm okay with no dual spec as long as they cap the respec cost

[2:56:42] purrfecto: banning gdkp just promotes socialism lol
[2:57:25] GodKingMuninn: Thats one of their fattest wow token cash cows that no one gives a fuck about. Let it fund wow.
[2:57:28] purrfecto: i mean i can honestly see both sides ... but the easiest part to combat gdkp is to not participate in it
[2:57:40] 91Niki: This just boils down to the fact that some people are overly abusing that system, and ruining the fun for those who can manage it properly
[2:57:52] Zolshy89: gold inflation

[2:57:54] Ranthyr_: it effects gold buyers trying to do gdkp
[2:58:00] ackdogg007: it blows up the auction house
[2:58:06] reggiepowa: botting impacts economy, gkdps just exchange gold between players
[2:58:22] GodKingMuninn: GDKP funds the demand for bots which advances the gold inflation, which in turn fucks the economy.
[2:58:27] serawrbear: gdkps impact botting for gold
[2:58:27] 91Niki: o/
[2:58:30] Molvonos: The people who dont wanna participate in the MMO aspect of a MMORPG.
[2:58:31] arthalie: I feel like the economy more gets affected by 25 gold gray items xD

[2:58:42] ShadowDMG6969: It hurts the casual who does who only plays the solo content
[2:58:43] expbottles: wonder if they will ban gdkp in Cata classix
[2:58:48] Aquadriel: o/
[2:58:53] Ranthyr_: gdkp = big demand for gold buyers
[2:58:54] reggiepowa: @GodKingMuninn there will always be bots though
[2:58:55] Zolshy89: o/
[2:59:01] purrfecto: because here's the deal ... if you participate in a gdkp and do not win what you want ... you get paid for your time ... if you pug and do not get what you want ... alot of the times you don't even clear nor do you get anything.
[2:59:01] Nitemareforu: \o
[2:59:26] snarkydonald: all you had to say was earmuffs! lol.
[2:59:27] StarbuckTech: morning all... watching while working
[2:59:44] ShadowDMG6969: Constant Spawn camping yelling at people that the spawn is yours lol
[2:59:47] NordoTv: Loot Whore = Asmongold's style of gearing....Can I get that?
[2:59:57] opalwinfrey: GDKP wont go away. We will just do it all through a discord and comms.
[3:00:15] Molvonos: @opalwinfrey And that puts your account at risk.  So you have that going for you.
[3:00:26] Molvonos: Ya'll acting like nothing's gonna change, lol
[3:00:28] LiuKanggx: what is masterloot?
[3:00:37] purrfecto: i mean personally i just like to carry gdkps to make gold since most of my toons are out of quests
[3:00:39] reggiepowa: @opalwinfrey if they implement it in a proper way they might easily kill it. nobody does gdkps on retail even though you technically can
[3:00:43] 91Niki: @opalwinfrey Wow, you really are ignorant if you think that won't get you caught. Not like Blizzard can track gold or anything :p
[3:00:44] Holysal: @LiuKanggx 1 person loots all the gear
[3:00:50] squishalan: I wish they wouldnt do crazy experiments in my fave version of the game so far
[3:00:58] opalwinfrey: @Molvonos Most of us have more than 1 account. Im not worried about losing a Seasonal account.
[3:01:19] warrenny: master loot sucks
[3:01:22] LiuKanggx: oh that's fine
[3:01:35] 91Niki: @opalwinfrey Found the gold seller in chat
[3:01:48] OGaxelaw: so many people use it they wont be able to do anything about it
[3:01:54] Molvonos: @opalwinfrey Interesting you think they won't ban the entire account versus a 'seasonal' one.

[3:01:57] purrfecto: @Towelliee but isn't selling mythic raid mounts unethical?
[3:02:16] AstridLory: people can just buy carry runs like they do in retail now
[3:02:21] instant_savage: @purrfecto as long as its just for gold and not real money
[3:02:23] squishalan: its a small community anyway
[3:02:24] warrenny: well bad master looters suck
[3:02:36] OGaxelaw: just join a guild that doesnt do gdkp why is that hard?
[3:02:38] 91Niki: Blizzard can literally track gold. They don't need no in game chat to put two and two together
[3:02:50] arthalie: @towelliee Antithetical not anti ethical, against the spirit of the game as opposed to being morally wrong
[3:02:51] opalwinfrey: @Molvonos I feel like they should focus on the big picture.. the gold buyer/sellers. no?
[3:02:55] warrenny: rmt runs? no gold sale why tf not
[3:02:58] purrfecto: @instant_savage but gdkp is just for gold as it is now
[3:03:10] TheGiant99: I don't get the outrage over the AOTC mount being in the trading post
[3:03:10] ShadowDMG6969: yeah
[3:03:25] 91Niki: @Towelliee they are gonna hire out of country people for that. Cheap hire
[3:03:27] Molvonos: @opalwinfrey lol, no.  They have different teams for different aspects.  You get grouped with breaking a rule they're enforcing, your account's gonna get smacked.
[3:03:32] Wcvechten: the one from SoO
[3:03:35] Zolshy89: the Mop aotc mount
[3:03:35] OGaxelaw: ?
[3:03:36] 91Niki: From SOO yeah
[3:03:38] instant_savage: the siege of org mount
[3:03:41] stallowned: the wolf from mop

[3:04:03] Elijahss: you just past it
[3:04:03] purrfecto: you just past it
[3:04:05] ninetynil: I worked hard to earn that mount in 2014 reee
[3:04:05] 91Niki: You just scrolled past it
[3:04:05] runehako: the shitty lookin wolf from 15 years ago
[3:04:06] chrisrev: bruh u just looked at it
[3:04:06] Alaquane: you just s rolled past in on page2

[3:04:32] purrfecto: for soo yes
[3:04:35] OGaxelaw: its not actually aotc
[3:04:38] 91Niki: Dude that was the best wolf mount ever !
[3:04:40] purrfecto: was juggernaught pount
[3:04:42] purrfecto: mount
[3:04:48] reggiepowa: dont look at comments
[3:04:50] skylaars: no one remembers that mount kek

[3:05:14] ninetynil: great mount. love that wolf
[3:05:16] CDubTheRIPper: monkaS
[3:05:26] OGaxelaw: i dont mind it. tbh its a waste for things to be taken out of the game
[3:05:34] 91Niki: CHICKEN HYPERS
[3:05:46] CoffeeASAP: I dont mind, I hate fomo style rewards in games
[3:05:47] runehako: yeah people who peaked in life during SoO are mad that their 15 year old shitty lookin mount is available for everyone
[3:05:48] Pritamin: i dont get it, they hit an engine limitation? why not just recolor it? Kappa
[3:05:50] OGaxelaw: most of the players who got things like that back in the day dont even play the game
[3:06:03] stallowned: im waiting for the blue rocket to complete my tcg set lol
[3:06:05] reggiepowa: if the purpose of a mount is to be a fomo rewards then it should be unobtainable. they should recolor it for trading post
[3:06:07] NobodybetterPat: how many that still play and actually have it lol
[3:06:12] NobodybetterPat: not many im sure
[3:06:14] CDubTheRIPper: NODDERS
[3:06:18] warrenny: imo two expacs and go for it
[3:06:19] Wcvechten: Nah, they fired the dude in charge for that I bet
[3:06:20] GodKingMuninn: I kind of hope they do a new spectral mount. I'd love a spectral magic rooster.
[3:06:21] Sniper_Penguin: new content? nah.
[3:06:21] zeitgeiz: everyone has the achievement still and that is the more important thing
[3:06:21] Elijahss: let the new people have fun with it
[3:06:22] ninetynil: love rocket coming to trading post
[3:06:22] reggiepowa: exactly
[3:06:25] 91Niki: Idk why we are gatekeeping mounts. Let people have shit, it won't affect you
[3:06:26] NordoTv: put the store mounts in traders post
[3:06:28] CDubTheRIPper: bring back some classic mounts lol
[3:06:31] Holysal: just put them all in the store so i can buy them
[3:06:31] smokingcactus: imagine AH mount on the trading post
[3:06:33] zeitgeiz: who you showing that mount off to lol
[3:06:34] Eviltuna13: just release old glad mounts rooEZ
[3:06:36] Alaquane: I thought the artists got laid off
[3:06:38] lithium364: the people who got fired worked on new trading mounts Kappa
[3:06:39] OGaxelaw: some mounts ive never even seen in game like AQ scarab ect
[3:06:40] teky0: just  give us a cool horse on the post
[3:06:41] instant_savage: why not use pvp mounts all the vicous mounts just sit there for pve players
[3:06:48] Qargory: put nightmare in battle pass, i cba doing that again
[3:06:55] tat3potat3: I want a mount like the bike that mr Grayson rides in southpark
[3:07:03] tat3potat3: mr garrison*
[3:07:10] reggiepowa: @91Niki because the point of the mount is to say I played and did the raid back then. if it's a cool model which was never used they should recolor it and use again but they shouldn't give the original to everyone
[3:07:27] 91Niki: @Towelliee I get AOTC from 1-2 expansions ago. But mounts that are 5+ years old. Why do we still care.
[3:07:31] warrenny: what was the achieve for bear?
[3:07:32] TheMachine_907: You mean our Sub dollars get put to work? Yes please
[3:07:33] gali5656: @tat3potat3 mechagon mount
[3:07:36] b_lappy: marrowfang?
[3:07:40] 91Niki: @reggiepowa Cool, you have an achievement.
[3:07:49] Elijahss: lot's of people bought their war bear run with gold
[3:07:52] tat3potat3: I want a mount that's literally just a bigger version of my character
[3:07:52] instant_savage: agrus aotc was some dumb bird
[3:07:58] warrenny: you can still get shackled urzul
[3:08:01] runehako: literally nobody
[3:08:01] OGaxelaw: what they need to do is bring back the secret tony the tiger mount that was behind zul gurub the no armor model
[3:08:07] reggiepowa: @reggiepowa I also have a mount, mount is a better way to say that than an achievement, just make a new recolored mount for everyone else why is that such a big deal
[3:08:12] DrkPhoenix6913: hey that wolf is still in my favorites rotation when im on the ground :P
[3:08:37] warrenny: only aotc mount i use bar fyrakk is nyalotha
[3:08:39] Treevinal: I feel like 10 years is pretty "Ahead of the curve"
[3:08:40] 91Niki: @reggiepowa Why is it such a big deal that other people get access to content they can't get cuz they didn't know wow was a thing then or just didn't play?
[3:08:49] warrenny: aotc mounts isnt fomo dumbass
[3:09:15] Elijahss: @warrenny sure they are

[3:09:16] 91Niki: @reggiepowa Besides your personal hurt feelings ofc.
[3:09:26] dokor: @Towelliee i still use it whenever i need a ground mount, but that's just because i like the way it looks, i really coudn't care less if it was in the trader post
[3:09:28] reggiepowa: @reggiepowa because the point of the mount is to be limited time reward, why does everyone need to have everything? get other mounts which exist when you start playing
[3:09:39] Badd_Boi: exactly
[3:09:46] tat3potat3: I want a world of warcraft x one piece collaboration with mounts and its just a bunch of flying mounts based on different pirate ships from one piece
[3:09:49] LegendaryViewer: @91Niki video-games are about personal feelings, are they not?
[3:09:50] 91Niki: @reggiepowa Sounds like your personal entitlement
[3:09:52] Alaquane: aint no way Ion is giving away his scarab lord mount
[3:09:56] warrenny: @elijahss if your going to clear it anyway youd earn the mount therefore not fo,o
[3:10:01] Wcvechten: then again, it might also still be from that pandamonium event like they mentioned later this year
[3:10:05] Moonrayna: i dont even remember what the aotc mount is and I have it
[3:10:11] Badd_Boi: what everyone else is doing with their time is game is none of anyone elses business
[3:10:15] zeitgeiz: my friend sold his account for $500 in wrath. he took it back at the end cause he wanted to play again and the guy he sold it to had a swift spectral tiger lol. never sell an account
[3:10:16] 91Niki: @LegendaryViewer Right, but do you loose sleep over somebody else's happiness over getting a mount?
[3:10:20] warrenny: or at least its good fomo
[3:10:35] OGaxelaw: is the secret bengal tiger mount in SOD?
[3:10:35] Moobot: https://twitter.com/towelthetank/status/1743035635030691892
[3:10:50] Ovium56: never understood why people got butt hurt about this stuff. some one else gets in with in game currency and all of a sudden your life is ruined
[3:10:53] CoffeeASAP: those sort of mounts only really have any sort of prestige early in the season anyway
[3:10:56] teky0: @reggiepowa it sounds like you need better achievement than an aotc mount. old mounts being exclusive should be the least  of anyones worries
[3:11:04] LegendaryViewer: @91Niki the emotional value of getting a mount is certainly diminished if other people get it in an easier way.
[3:11:08] Pritamin: i dont care what other ppl think, I mad because Blizzard is unreasonably lazy
[3:11:10] instant_savage: i thought u couldnt get the title herald of the titans anymore
[3:11:11] jarilrpg: give it 2 expansions, then put all that limited time stuff on the trading posts (AoTC, KSM, Glad mounts/sets)
[3:11:17] 91Niki: I got some mounts that you can't get no longer. I am all for other people getting access to them. If that gives other people a good time. Go for it
[3:11:22] warrenny: garrosh looms shouldnt have been removed
[3:11:24] tat3potat3: servers are back up, just got the best vault reward pop
[3:11:29] reggiepowa: @reggiepowa no sounds like basic game design. blizzard made a mount to say ''I was here then'', they shouldnt change their minds retroactively just like they didnt with mage tower rewards. make recolors for current players
[3:11:37] tat3potat3: poggers
[3:11:41] purrfecto: @Towelliee not directing at you ... but do you see the irony of people okay about achievement mounts being on a tendor vendor but angry about a system they don't evne participate in? (gdkp)
[3:11:45] OGaxelaw: i think even that one is old enough tbh
[3:11:46] instant_savage: @Towelliee wait if aotc mounts can be on the post how do u feel about glad mounts being on the post
[3:11:49] 91Niki: @LegendaryViewer 10 years later? I think it's time to see a therapist if it bothers you that much :p

[3:53:18] 91Niki: @vikaelzidek Oh for sure. But if a dog is known for not liking strangers, asking if you can help ease the delivery with treats, is definitely a good idea
[3:53:35] surealkiller83: My frenchies cost too damn much money haha
