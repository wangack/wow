[3:27:34] wEiRdO_dUdE: I saw a rogue guy running about 38% vers on Outlaw, it's just kind of an evolved meta
[3:27:34] Moobot: Tshirts, hoodies, and mugs available now! https://merch.streamelements.com/notmes
[3:28:05] wEiRdO_dUdE: He had like 40% crit on that thing, but it was all the vers that stuck out to me
[3:29:53] wEiRdO_dUdE: I also did see a blood DK in 3's and their team won
[3:30:57] wEiRdO_dUdE: Boomkin down! Sweet
[3:31:31] brindleindle: clawing doesnt look half bad still
[3:32:36] wEiRdO_dUdE: That's a lot of mastery
[3:33:38] wEiRdO_dUdE: Someone talked about how the crit modifier is weaker in PvP now, I have to wonder if that does tend to make crit less valuable
[3:34:11] wEiRdO_dUdE: I used to like those crazy "all attack power" builds that never relied on crit at all
[3:39:15] wEiRdO_dUdE: Awesome action!
[3:39:31] xiliketurtlex: looks like you found the solution to dk's nerf problem
[3:40:16] wEiRdO_dUdE: I don't know how the destro lasted that long, he must be one of the better ones
[3:43:05] wEiRdO_dUdE: According to the sub rogues, the health difference alone was enough to sink them
[3:43:55] happyheals: they have a cure for it
[3:44:47] wEiRdO_dUdE: Yeah I think it usually says "the death knight's diseases" or such

[4:20:45] ionlyplaymetas: so do you think this new full verse mastery not tier is the move? im debating grinding out the set you have on this dk.
[4:20:47] Antiquasar: Are you still testing the high vers mastery no haste? Thoughts?
[4:24:32] xiliketurtlex: do you feel tankier after you switched to high vers?
[4:24:58] happyheals: nothing really makes sense anymore. We just do it
[4:25:29] happyheals: well, you have like 93% vers
[4:25:34] happyheals: jk
[4:25:55] potionirl: sorry if you've been asked this 1 millions times -- why are you playing without tier?

[4:26:48] SebboTheFro: @potionirl Tier doesnt give us any actual value in PvP, the damage from tier doesnt line up with our burst ontop of being kinda statpad since the magus attacks off-targets etc
[4:28:06] notrhyslol: what is it about dk that makes u main it?
[4:28:25] ionlyplaymetas: have you thought about dropping superstrain and the points in morbidity to get reduced CD on DT with unholy command and an additional point into goulish frenzy? would make your 1shot gos more frequent/aligned and hit harder
[4:28:35] SebboTheFro: @notrhyslol Lul, Id assume preference?
[4:28:42] Drathimos: what is he losing though? sure tier has a bit of crit on them that could be verse instead but that doesnt seem worth dropping tier over.
[4:29:20] happyheals: He can get better stats for his build by not having the tier
[4:29:36] notrhyslol: @SebboTheFro obviously , im asking what is it about the class like ? the feel of it? the aesthetic? like just a question bro
[4:29:46] SebboTheFro: @Drathimos I mean tier in your average arena lobby provides an average 5%-ish damage, which he overcomes by alot by getting better stats on non tier gear
[4:31:17] omkar3108: PogChamp
[4:31:17] Moobot: Join my Discord community! https://discord.gg/mes
[4:31:19] SebboTheFro: 5% might not be 100% accurate but from my own exp, the magus seems to deal 5-6% of my total on average
[4:32:24] happyheals: but if it isn't attacking the target he wants to attack, at the time he wants to attack it, then if he can gain even 2-3% more dmg on kill target it is worth
[4:33:07] happyheals: he gets more than 2-3% just using as an example
[4:33:24] SebboTheFro: @happyheals Yeah, and from the looks of it he gets way more value than that currently too
[4:34:58] happyheals: yeah, he gained a lot of versatility which makes him tankier and provides more consistent dmg
[4:36:01] potionirl: does magus hit targets in trap/incap?
[4:36:14] Antiquasar: ahh yesterday you was 44% verse
[4:36:40] happyheals: mastery is nice like that
[4:37:25] happyheals: versatility you lose 10% after 30% then 20% after 40% then 30% after 50%

[4:41:41] krome2dadome: ahhhh?
[4:42:12] Antiquasar: i remember petkick said magus was x2 nerfed
[4:42:13] Dudewuut: yes the talent is nerfed by 50% and the tier is nerfed by 50%
[4:42:33] Dudewuut: we got fucked yeah
[4:43:13] Dudewuut: attack power and strength
[4:43:19] krome2dadome: nerf warr

[4:49:15] Antiquasar: HAHA
[4:49:29] Dudewuut: yup
[4:49:32] ionlyplaymetas: bro blizz devs never cease to amaze me 🙄 that is absolutely outrageously bad
[4:49:42] Dudewuut: i mean it is chip damage does it really make a diffy
[4:49:55] happyheals: not at the cost of stats that can make you better on gos
[4:50:00] Antiquasar: waste of a talent point
[4:50:20] krome2dadome: drop it NODDERS
[4:50:20] ionlyplaymetas: more value from cdr on dark transform at that point
[4:50:22] wEiRdO_dUdE: Sounds like the stats might be worth more than the tier set, I've heard that is the case for other tier sets
[4:50:32] Dudewuut: just fuck dk 50% nerf on a random ability it was a bullseye on the dart board that week
[4:51:06] krome2dadome: so do u not play tier either?
[4:51:12] ionlyplaymetas: secret tech incoming 😂

[4:54:58] krome2dadome: just go full m+ build
[4:55:18] SebboTheFro: @atoker No wounds is kinda troll

[4:55:59] Croix4: mes fitna try frost no chill streak no tier
[4:56:01] atoker: I swapped back to wounds
[4:56:03] Croix4: jkjk
[4:56:05] Antiquasar: oh your not playing ebon fever?
[4:56:44] sickly_wow: maybe its diff at max cr, but i feel clawing has most kill potential
[4:57:19] ionlyplaymetas: you can drop blight and get 2 points into CDR  on dark transform while keeping super/morbidity, 45s goes instead of 1 min, maybe even drop 1 morbidity and put 2x into ghoulish frenzy at that poinr
[4:57:21] Averyzan: @.es
[4:57:44] Averyzan: Would ghoulish frenzy be any good or is it nerfed in pvp as well? The attack speed and dmg on transform
[4:58:40] wEiRdO_dUdE: It makes gearing easier for people, if they don't have to worry about tier set at all
[4:58:41] atoker: I'm gonna swap to 2 piece on dh and do kinda the same with
[4:58:51] happyheals: Icarus thought he could fly so he jumped from a high place
[4:58:54] happyheals: he died
[5:00:13] ionlyplaymetas: @atoker dh definitely not worth, hunt is huge value and you can easily get 80+ mastery and 30+ verse with 4set still

[5:02:41] dawsonator171: versatility doesn't make you versatile?

[5:03:16] firecck: What addon tells you the wasted stats?
[5:03:19] Zonnis: is that a WA that shows the wasted stats?
[5:03:19] wEiRdO_dUdE: Yeah I'm not sure going over 40% is a good idea, with the increased diminishing returns
[5:03:32] dawsonator171: @Yoskexz but does assassination assassinate?
[5:03:38] krome2dadome: @firecck true stat values

[5:04:13] dawsonator171: mes, who is your copium supplier?
[5:04:14] happyheals: when you play a class where the tier bonuses are wasted, then if you have to waste some stats so be it
[5:04:20] Alerothan: Is it worth overcapping on vers that much?
[5:04:57] happyheals: he is doing it for theory crafting purposes
[5:05:09] wEiRdO_dUdE: Whoa
[5:05:29] wEiRdO_dUdE: That sounded like vers over mastery
[5:05:51] weckso: how'd the queues go?
[5:05:53] dawsonator171: listen, if you divide by zero anything is possible. That's the Ronald McDonald way.
[5:06:00] Dudewuut: are you into your second mastery dr yet
[5:06:05] Dudewuut: the 20%
[5:06:13] happyheals: depends on how much mastery for 1% for you
[5:06:20] ionlyplaymetas: dk is the new ret, tier sucks, no real ms, dies to casters, full verse build 😭 10.2.5 is trash
[5:07:19] wEiRdO_dUdE: Vers pumps up that survability with more heals too
[5:07:42] dawsonator171: vers pumps. never thought I'd see that in a sentence.
[5:07:45] wyldeshock: good morning
[5:08:28] dawsonator171: unholy has pseudo ms.
[5:08:35] happyheals: yeah, you have to to live
[5:08:40] Dudewuut: they only stack vers at the highest keys to avoid getting 1shot by mechs
[5:08:58] dawsonator171: high end fury warrs also push up vers.
[5:09:31] happyheals: I run higher vers in keys than I do in arena
[5:09:39] AethrosTempest: just got here - are you re-gemming and enchanting for vers>mastery Mes?
[5:09:55] dawsonator171: he is currently mid mesMath session
[5:11:14] happyheals: at 35% you lose 10% of your gains then at 40% you lose 20% of gains
[5:11:22] wEiRdO_dUdE: Some of those outlaw rogues are running a bunch of vers along with like 40% crit
[5:12:10] ionlyplaymetas: Tuesday patch notes “we’ve noticed some DKs have found a way to make their class still playable in pvp and that goes against our philosophy. DK will now take increased dmg for every point of versatility they have and death coil will heal enemies.”

[5:24:02] happyheals: since last time we were powerful, they quickly destroyed our mastery and let us suffer until now

[5:27:48] Pwnyo808: something dies for sure
[5:27:54] ianryan306: im a DK lmao not even a healer
[5:28:01] ianryan306: no its sniper for sure
[5:28:03] krome2dadome: @ianryan306 you don't have the right to say u farmed anyone
[5:28:07] wyldeshock: @pwnyo808 I want to become a surv god. I’ve always really liked the spec but learning it intimidates me
[5:28:08] ianryan306: sniper into rapid
[5:28:22] ianryan306: hey at least im using my incap warstomps and cloning ppl
[5:28:25] ianryan306: i press buttons too
[5:28:27] Pwnyo808: @wyldeshock i just finished getting surv up.  I wanted all the specs at 1800 at least

[5:28:32] Pwnyo808: surv was by far the roughest
[5:28:35] ianryan306: incap for some reason doesnt break on dmg right away
[5:28:35] happyheals: my biggest hurdle coming back to arena after being gone is the ui boss
[5:28:51] happyheals: Anything and everything has broken on me
[5:29:05] wyldeshock: @pwnyo808 I think it takes more skill and knowledge
[5:29:33] ianryan306: @pwnyo808 you typed too many abilities there. We kill in .5 seconds lol
[5:29:56] happyheals: even big debuffs had invisible boxes for every spell going across the middle of my screen so I couldnt interact or spin camera
[5:29:58] StarShopping95: @ianryan306 and you wonder why people hate you
[5:30:00] Pwnyo808: @ianryan306 ah fair, i guess sniper would just one tap, but i haaaaate sniper
[5:30:02] ianryan306: “world’s fastest one shots” on youtube see for yourself. Straight up .5-1 sec kills
[5:30:17] ianryan306: i dont wonder lol im fine with it, its fun as hell regardless
[5:30:17] krome2dadome: absolute scum
[5:30:28] Pwnyo808: @wyldeshock i don't think it does really, it's just simply not as good, and it depends on what you're good at
[5:30:33] Pwnyo808: MM you ahve to be really good at kiting
[5:30:41] ianryan306: our team sucks in this meta. every team has bop or spectral
[5:30:44] ianryan306: he doesnt move bro
[5:30:49] happyheals: Hasn't rogue been like that several times since like 2007
[5:30:51] ianryan306: he stands still hes multiboxing
[5:30:53] Pwnyo808: and finding spots to shove damage, but Surv you just kinda bounce around and annoy people
[5:31:13] ianryan306: that bicmex guy destroys on surv
[5:31:23] ianryan306: he won that big duel tourny recently
[5:31:24] archtme: where is the link to mesui_castbars again @notmes ?

[5:31:36] Pwnyo808: @ianryan306 yeah he's really good, but that's just because he's good at it
[5:31:43] happyheals: I'm 0 cr in 3s
[5:31:58] Deacon_III: Hey @notmes, Is it not worth getting flux melting on ele when bursting?
[5:32:24] ianryan306: u def shouldnt waste the global on frost shock its more of a filler spell
[5:32:46] ianryan306: hits hard as enh, does nothing on ele and only buffs 1 single lava burst
[5:33:01] krome2dadome: yea it's raider io
[5:33:19] hyttzdrag: I’m around if you need a pres again, just lmk

[5:41:55] SebboTheFro: Whats the argument for plaguebringer over claw in 2s, cause for me it just always feels slightly worse in 2s @notmes
[5:43:40] happyheals: if the game is successful then Pokemon will sue
[5:44:27] ShaHugs: it already is successful
[5:47:16] happyheals: we see it as successful but a corporation would need to see longevity and marketing outside of the game itself.
[5:47:42] happyheals: Like if they make merchandise, does that cut into Pokemon merchandise sales
[5:48:59] happyheals: yes
[5:49:18] SebboTheFro: I just feel like in 2s specifically I have overall more uptime on everything as clawing, even festermight, ontop of whenver you face certain classes like hpal etc you have to reapply dots frequently
[5:49:33] SebboTheFro: Might just be a skill issue and clawing is easier value, idk

[6:06:07] sillysheepweepandsleep: why suddenly everyone is playing the eye beam build now
[6:06:35] SebboTheFro: @sillysheepweepandsleep More consistent pressure
[6:07:35] GlobalWarming: @sillysheepweepandsleep it just works in pvp better, the other build was kinda paddy
[6:07:55] SebboTheFro: ^
[6:08:11] sillysheepweepandsleep: 🙏 thanks
[6:09:06] sillysheepweepandsleep: I was learning the old build and suddenly everyone is eyebeaming lol
[6:09:51] SebboTheFro: I mean DH playstyle is basically the same regardless, you just get to beam and meta more often with this ontop of having a nice burst addition on chaos strike due to beam talents
[6:14:19] sillysheepweepandsleep: I remember before everyone is running the fel barrage

[9:34:18] happyheals: Cookie is so innocent
[9:35:06] happyheals: I have an sound in WA that is cookie monster
[9:35:11] happyheals: a*
[9:35:52] happyheals: it is too long to use for a cd announcement though
[9:35:59] happyheals: kinda sad

[9:38:34] happyheals: Melmac needs to get with the times
[9:39:03] happyheals: some people turn them off for gifted subs
[9:39:18] happyheals: some celebrities have it like that
[9:40:40] happyheals: I have tried to gift a few messing around that has the box greyed out and says that account isn't accepting gifted subs
[9:42:40] CasualNicholas: what build are you playing?
[9:42:49] CasualNicholas: everything i try feels bad
[9:43:16] thunderstud25: whenever i got a little bit of separation the druid was there for the stun or cc to prevent escape which was just annoying
[9:43:28] Blaze150000: your not playing the magus ?
[9:44:24] Blaze150000: i know what u mean
[9:44:44] Jackietothemoon: !time
[9:44:46] Zerolol123: but it's a mage. it has to be worth using Kappa
[9:44:46] happyheals: my rip does over 300k dmg. I felt I had to share
[9:45:04] krome2dadome: mes have u guys tried outlaw/unh?
[9:45:48] Zerolol123: "i don't understand it" and blizzard changes make the perfect duo
[9:46:03] americanmoses18: cant wait to ret some ppl dis weekend
[9:46:13] krome2dadome: feel like a dk grouping things up for outlaw cleave would be so hot
[9:46:30] Zerolol123: outlaw only exists to dampen
[9:46:52] krome2dadome: dk can do that very well tho
[9:47:16] Zerolol123: but outlaw and dk together isn't a dampen comp
[9:47:26] krome2dadome: why not?
[9:47:37] Zerolol123: and dks die pretty easily rn too
[9:47:41] Zerolol123: especially in dampen
[9:47:50] krome2dadome: do they tho?
[9:47:58] Blaze150000: so if playing clawing build u can remove magus into secon point of morbidity ?
[9:51:31] plebcake_: 1h frost sustain build new meta KappaHD
[9:52:11] thunderstud25: i think if pally gets trained its just an inevitable mana race at that point
[9:52:23] thunderstud25: because ima oom fast without getting to maximize flash
[9:52:26] Begasaur: Morning
[9:52:44] Begasaur: it was good just sore adn tired now

[9:53:21] Begasaur: just gunna try to push keys on my druid i think today

[9:54:40] dkmyles: how do you think frost will be?
[9:54:51] Begasaur: i leveled my druid the other day so just tanking keys now for fun, silly that im at 38% vers
[9:55:12] plebcake_: @notmes is there a place to see what talents are nerfed in pvp ??
[9:55:20] happyheals: I wore all pvp gear and was doing 20s. It depends on your spec's stats
[9:56:17] Axesmittayyy: Axesmittayyy subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 6 months! 
[9:56:17] StreamElements: Axesmittayyy just subscribed for 6 months in a row mesDad mesDad mesWeckso
[9:57:06] happyheals: @Axesmittayyy the trick to doing mythic+ is to put your own key up in lfg instead of applying to keys
[9:57:25] happyheals: at low raider io it is hard to get into dungeons
[9:59:09] happyheals: if your key is the number for certain crest farming (Aspect is +16) You will have geared, high score players willing to carry you for the dungeon.
[10:01:17] Axesmittayyy: thank you happyheals!
[10:02:08] archtme: hey @notmes still got a link to mesui_castbar somewhere? or do you use a different focus castbar these days?
[10:04:18] thunderstud25: changing a couple of talents around to squeeze out a bit more mana
[10:04:29] TiltTeamGG: 2020Snacking
[10:04:34] thunderstud25: since all of these matchups are super heavy damp
[10:04:42] easybola: VoHiYo

[10:10:24] Blaze150000: its the clawing build with unholy blight and plaguebringer basicly
[10:10:37] Blaze150000: without the magus
[10:11:34] Blaze150000: more rot + doomburst

[10:17:22] thunderstud25: i can try to run plea, just wanted glare into the warrior also
[10:17:42] thunderstud25: yea plea will cause my healing to get a little bit more sketch when i use it
[10:18:18] thunderstud25: yea im not too worried about pushing more in 2s to be honest
[10:18:46] thunderstud25: i just haven't been able to play much in general so im down for whatever lol
[10:22:24] honsou2: the fear change... DH just using their fear as a third stun now
[10:23:37] thunderstud25: ima just have to play plea and try to optimize around it
[10:24:41] timmah25: that sham almost got deleted it opener, why hold stun?
[10:25:40] jporter_: got my first 2.4 of the season last night!
[10:25:47] timmah25: ya on the opener it looked like you had stun up when he lived below 10% and ran away
[10:26:11] PromiscuousToilet: Do not question Lord Mes. If he did not stun, he was saving it for some 5Head strats we cannot fathom
[10:26:18] PromiscuousToilet: KEKW

[10:45:37] happyheals: queueing for arena skirmish by yourself is the dumbest thing
