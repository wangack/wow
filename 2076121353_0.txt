[0:02:46] throwmasterlol: man that sucks
[0:04:27] throwmasterlol: tyrannical is so hard. i`m having big issues as disc on the first boss in waycrest. but tbh im just glad bolstering is gone
[0:04:36] Guarok: What up JB
[0:06:19] throwmasterlol: they should make pots last 40 min, would be so qol
[0:06:36] Guarok: Does resto like haste vers?
[0:10:38] Obeez: yeah those dragons are rough, probably gotta rely on perfect defensive layering from the team
[0:10:40] miiloswow: with all the defensives theyre adding in hero talents its looking like next expack might be more one shot M+'s
[0:12:17] Guarok: I do really wish they would take abilities that used to be baseline out of the talent trees and make them baseline again.
[0:12:29] tykus21: sounds retarded
[0:13:19] joffrey0101: Hi, Do you think not having belor/tank trinket is a significant issue past 27/28 keys (as rdruid)?
[0:13:30] Obeez: thats excactly how i feel on those dragons myself, and ive only done it on 28. the bl tech is big though
[0:14:52] Guarok: I was watching Kira do this part and an incorp spawned in the sand circle and completely fucked them.
[0:17:06] nairb1: sup big J
[0:19:55] majestictaco0: is it intentional to not soak that tank soak anymore? or does it just do so much at this key level you cant

[0:28:20] Icycutes: +5% size is the coolest talent so far right?
[0:29:16] ancester: Warriors got a +5% increase in size... that is exactly what I was expecting to see in all those hero trees tbh
[0:29:46] Nickhillcomedy: wildstalker could bring back that werecat form
[0:29:53] Deemonlord: Jay man, is there any addon to sghow people standign in decaying time/accelerating time? For the second boss in Galakrond.
[0:29:56] Nickhillcomedy: dark rangers should get red eyes
[0:30:39] numnumss: do you think they should just all be cosmentic? would be a good chance for a inscription reset also to do big into glyphs for even more customization.
[0:30:44] Deemonlord: ty!
[0:31:12] Crystallize007: its time for wow 2
[0:31:21] Crystallize007: to fix defensive bloat
[0:31:31] ancester: i mean they could still have those shitty +x% dmg increase etc but all should have a cosmetic feature built into it as  well

[0:38:38] numnumss: WW is a 3 part story, they could start the ground work for next, like patch 2 start adding stuff to build into the next xpac no?
[0:38:51] kenjataimuz: yea, they could add a terrible system like covenants and choregast tho
[0:38:55] numnumss: since its not a solo thing its ok to not have a redo every xpac no?
[0:39:19] treavorthenusance: torghast was ruled as inhumane torture by the international court
[0:39:22] numnumss: idk i just feel like cosmetics are lacking hard in this game, and idk what inscription even does since glpyhs are dead as shit
[0:39:28] numnumss: just missed oppertunity imo

[2:44:29] caradea_: does it really sound similar to you? not something i would've thought
[2:45:28] ren0m: I'm not sure if you're serious, but yes, both languages have similar "sounds".
[2:46:10] caradea_: yeah its a genuine question, german is my mother tongue so naturally it sounds really different to me

[3:46:26] hebodiles: Do you know who Brian Husky is? You look just like him!! You could be his stunt double
[3:48:30] face2face: Nah thats gotta be the dream
[3:48:48] Imorteus: do you still just use the mouse anchor efflo tracker?
[3:48:51] face2face: Most of the time you just live your life, then randomly someone makes your day saying they're your biggest fan
[3:49:58] laedine: Could you please talk me through a standard ramp of rdruid in raid please? (yes I have read wowhead)
[3:49:59] Imorteus: those things are not gonna sell real soon here
[3:51:23] laedine: Thank you - spam rejuvenation got it
[3:52:32] laedine: That's helpful thanks JB
[3:52:40] JackBurton176: @jdotb is avoidance better than speed in most instances? Does X amount of minimum speed help us get out of the fire and counter wind push/pull or is the slight increase pretty negligible?
[3:53:31] StreamElements: restreaming live every day to https://www.youtube.com/@jdotb
[3:53:37] Imorteus: i would imagine for druid you dont care much for speed
[3:53:38] clickermekk: im curious how Tindral feels now after the nerfs
[3:54:04] theBroHam: if you had the choice between the two,  avoidance for sure
[3:54:44] misstrace: Mythic raiding now on your Rdruid over priest? Because you all aren't progging anymore?
[3:55:35] misstrace: But you are a die hard rdruid so I am happy you are playing what you want
