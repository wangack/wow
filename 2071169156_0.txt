[0:37:26] DeadlyyDan: Heard of ashes of creation?
[0:37:33] dior_bifocals: i gotta ask, is bread better from work or prime time stream>
[0:38:02] DeadlyyDan: Go watch lazy peons videos on ashes. HUGE POTENTIAL
[0:38:20] rscmadnes: no ostress
[0:38:42] hejez: is it more fun than streaming tho?
[0:38:43] tichoka: First wow streamer who is not gambling his whole life in their few 100 subscribers living on minimal wage
[0:38:48] shootinmyshot22: ur stream was doing so good tho right before u went part time
[0:39:03] shootinmyshot22: like avg 1kmviewers
[0:39:15] shootinmyshot22: 1k*
[0:39:24] hejez: ur stream was doing good tho, averaging like 300-400
[0:39:29] simstarx: doesn't it feel weird being at conventions regarding adult content creation? KEKW
[0:39:57] puxapuxaa: its work LUL
[0:40:00] dunkrika: good choice, streaming is always there if you want to fall back on it!
[0:40:08] cowboylailax: what u do now for work?
[0:40:21] simstarx: haha yea i bet, you get used to what you do :)
[0:40:23] yamzxc: seems like a good time for a !job command
[0:40:30] DeadlyyDan: Having money isnt everything, not having having any is...
[0:40:44] spacemans11: Does Original play still?
[0:40:51] shootinmyshot22: just play wow…. tell ‘em u the fuckin king lol

[0:42:13] Orale_Holms: 1 month of arena will be fun. but  i wouldnt keep playing cata lol
[0:42:20] divtool: There's probably a better comparison there than hitler lmfao
[0:42:31] simstarx: I mean, yea, first season will have some hype and then it will die slowly
[0:42:33] SynthAttackTM: whats wrong with cata? i cant remember it was too long ago?
[0:42:33] snutzy: !job
[0:42:33] StreamElements: I work on a creator platform called Fansly.
[0:42:43] shootinmyshot22: how does Chan feel about you going part time? y’all have been on your wow journeys together since the beginning
[0:42:48] simstarx: hHAHAHHAHHAHA
[0:42:49] carmelo3312: @oakleafresin Lmao that was really your person of reference??? Sheeesh
[0:42:55] simstarx: weirdest comparison i've heard
[0:42:58] yamzxc: did sup fresh stop raiding after killing LK hc?
[0:43:43] Stars69: i dunno how you raided wotlk for so long
[0:43:49] LazaSea: any duel competition planed for SOD so far  ? Makgora event was dope af
[0:43:51] Stars69: thats some hozi willpower
[0:44:06] SynthAttackTM: @lazasea Xar is doing one i think
[0:44:24] SynthAttackTM: no clue
[0:45:30] simstarx: OTK is doing the tourney, Xar is commentating again.
[0:45:35] hejez: tipsout is organising one
[0:45:50] joonelius3: where you been man!? glad to see you back.
[0:46:17] joonelius3: good good.
[0:46:30] Stars69: nah i saw nazjak a total of four times over the course of 2 shifts
[0:47:12] Stars69: It was fahkd, perp was camping it on 3 layers, bean, hoz, 2 guilds. I had to track every layer and I lucked it on a random layer I guessed no one had killed on
[0:47:21] Stars69: no squad
[0:47:43] simstarx: ez perma
[0:47:44] simstarx: jesus
[0:47:50] Stars69: just blind luck honestly, I have 2 kills on nazjak total
[0:47:54] simstarx: alooo
[0:47:59] Stars69: 0 chance I get agm, I'm a solo player :(
[0:48:23] dlarneK: dlarneK subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 26 months! 
[0:48:27] Stars69: easier than you'd think, there are 10+ layers atm
[0:48:42] kiro_33: you been playing wow much? surprised youre not 40 already
[0:48:43] Stars69: bobka, hozi, and others have it, ally are at like 6-8/12
[0:49:28] awkwor_d: priest and melee hunter yea
[0:50:19] kiro_33: this phase not peaking ur interest?
[0:50:36] bolleboris1: ru gonna play cata?
[0:50:58] flexinbrah_: what job snutzy
[0:51:02] snutzy: !job
[0:51:02] Foffel: !job
[0:51:02] StreamElements: I work on a creator platform called Fansly.
[0:51:02] dj_efx: the phase honestly doesnt feel hype
[0:51:30] Magequit: R)
[0:51:36] RTienx: !job
[0:51:37] StreamElements: I work on a creator platform called Fansly.
[0:51:46] kiro_33: mm i think the balancing has been pretty chaotic and 25-40 was more of a grind than people realised
[0:51:47] StreamElements: All information regarding my addons, characters, or boosts will be found in my discord: https://discord.gg/eMTkkB3
[0:51:57] dj_efx: all my friends quit cuz of gdkp. none of the big streamers are playing. its been a lil rough getting groups
[0:52:20] awkwor_d: Any chance you might come back to full time streaming?
[0:52:53] dj_efx: people are getting wrongfully banned just for trading large amounts of gold. automated system sucks
[0:53:02] dj_efx: thats part of the shit phase
[0:53:28] itsGaash: What do ya do if you dont mind me askin
[0:53:41] SynthAttackTM: he does pron
[0:54:28] awkwor_d: do they know they are working with the best Warlock in the world?
[0:55:35] dj_efx: its def fun. im just not having as much of a good time. i personally dont feel any hype
[0:56:06] Stars69: there's nothing much to do end game this phase if you dont go for agm or tidal
[0:56:09] kiro_33: shits expensive.. p1 was great coz consumes were cheap, gear was pretty obtainable, felt like a lower bar of entry
[0:56:20] dj_efx: i could be trippin, but the gdkp community not playing, idk how big a hit that is, but seems like alot quit
[0:56:23] kiro_33: sweats could still sweat
[0:57:07] brownhammer112: snutz would you see your more of a tits or ass guy
[0:57:13] SynthAttackTM: i was bored to hell in P1 with bgs beeing boring and nothing else to do, no SOD for me without arena sadly
[0:57:24] brownhammer112: or the right answer, personality
[0:57:42] kiro_33: p1 def dragged out.. super alt friendly though
[0:58:15] SynthAttackTM: but @snutzy what u do all day in sod then?
[0:58:24] berni2031: yoo snutz, what have u been up to?
[0:58:25] SynthAttackTM: roam around doing world pvp? bgs?
[0:58:35] Dopaminex: what's up snutz
[0:58:36] dj_efx: i think they also let p1 go a lil too long and burned some people out
[0:58:47] SynthAttackTM: but world pvp is killing noobs mostly i feel, i need a challange
[0:59:16] kiro_33: era has a great wpvp scene, or had when it was popping
[0:59:17] ChillyHTX: PoroSad
[0:59:25] berni2031: full time job!? big, what kind of job?
[0:59:25] SynthAttackTM: and the biggest problem with SOD is there is literally NO DUELLING like it was back in vanilla classic
[0:59:28] SynthAttackTM: coz of layering etc
[0:59:38] ChillyHTX: ye I took a long break from wow then just came back to play
[0:59:41] SynthAttackTM: and ppl sitting in TB for buffs
[0:59:44] SynthAttackTM: noone duels ever
[0:59:55] snutzy: !job
[0:59:56] StreamElements: I work on a creator platform called Fansly.
[1:00:19] SynthAttackTM: like i dont understand the SOD pvpers, why noone duels
[1:00:32] SynthAttackTM: was big part of the fun in original classic
[1:00:39] kiro_33: i guess theyre experimenting with so much its hard to keep ontop of it all. so many flow on effects that are hard to predict player behaviour
[1:00:45] divtool: I was against the ban on GDKPs at first but I'm actually enjoying not having them. They felt like an obligation because it was the best way to get gear and gold. Raiding with a guild for the first time in a while and enjoying the social aspect of the game a lot more again.
[1:01:32] berni2031: ohh thats cool, congrats on the job! 🙌🏼
[1:02:31] kiro_33: i miss that first classic release.. itll be hard to ever recreate that hype
[1:02:41] berni2031: well, i riped my knee while skiing - so lots of gameing lately …
[1:02:49] JustOndore: Death coil babyyy
[1:03:05] MynxieDMAW: i'm still waiting for that classic plus with rbgs
[1:03:06] kiro_33: that dueling tourny was huge. you were hyped af
[1:03:39] awkwor_d: Do you think they should add arena in SoD?
[1:04:10] kiro_33: rbgs might be more in line with classic
[1:04:46] kiro_33: much more comp options and strategy.. arena gets locked into a meta v quick
[1:05:43] awkwor_d: Its pretty easy right now i think
[1:05:54] joonelius3: it has its ups and downs. I bet this’ll be a faceroll in couple weeks.
[1:06:26] vepsee: people are learning to finally just do dmg instead of the 1 mechanic each boss has lmao
[1:06:28] vepsee: bosses are falling over
[1:06:47] kiro_33: id be interested if the raids would be seen as content people would do if there wasnt lvl cap
[1:07:26] awkwor_d: Whats the best 1v1 class in vanilla?
[1:07:56] vepsee: if spriest gets any better runes most likely that
[1:07:59] vepsee: shits already stacked
[1:08:08] nc716: do u boost in retail
[1:08:14] awkwor_d: will you run soul link or sm/ruin?
[1:08:14] Twiello: ele sham by far
[1:08:25] kiro_33: wasnt a particular lock build banned in the cdl back in classic?
[1:08:37] MynxieDMAW: that doesnt answer the question snutty
[1:09:03] awkwor_d: whats so bs
[1:09:07] awkwor_d: thats*
[1:09:35] kiro_33: too strong? still won doesnt matter lol
