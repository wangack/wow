[0:05:59] Beerbelli: Butt bongo that cat (If he likes it)!
[0:06:04] bobbab5: bobbab5 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 17 months, currently on a 15 month streak! Hey Hazel!
[0:06:05] Streamlabs: bobbab5 just subscribed with Tier 1!
[0:06:44] DapherCake: Hi Hazel! Currently in bed with the flu, just ordered Pho and time to rest during the stream! Hope you're well xx
[0:06:51] saga_no: I know you probably explained it during my hiatus, but I'm curious nonetheless.... What prompted the Wig Era?
[0:07:13] cupcakechaos013: so! I’m very excited, I normally don’t read much. but my friends and I kind of started a book club.
[0:07:17] Perkolate: ven vill vu vear vigs
[0:07:32] saga_no: They look great - I may have to look into getting some
[0:07:52] heldtheline: That clip has become part of the Hazel required viewing now, I think.
[0:07:54] jgbrit: @saga_no don't you mean Vy do you Vear Vigs
[0:08:17] Krekk01: you gonna try to get the achievement, Hazel?
[0:08:22] cupcakechaos013: yea they all wanted to read a court of thorns and roses? I have no suggestions haha the last series I read was Harry potter
[0:08:42] cashthb: holla
[0:08:48] saga_no: @jgbrit Nah - I kinda figured the reason would be "just because *shrug*" so I was basically just confirming my bias LUL
[0:08:53] DapherCake: Would you say your leveled and geared more alts last season or this season?
[0:08:58] witchhobbit: it's entertaining to say the least LUL
[0:09:09] witchhobbit: i wouldn't really call it Good
[0:09:14] jeffdmk: How often do you think about pirate ships?
[0:09:17] witchhobbit: it is like...twilight perhaps
[0:09:35] Voidtzu: the Webb telescope found a ring of galaxies 1.5 billion light-years in diameter!
[0:09:39] wolfcloudchaser80: That woman must have an ultra-mega liver, given all the booze she's given.
[0:10:04] witchhobbit: LUL
[0:10:15] marithered0203: heheheh Kira
[0:10:23] jeffdmk: nobody say anything
[0:10:37] cashthb: the worgen guy, btw nice cam
[0:10:47] witchhobbit: LUL
[0:10:58] cashthb: ruined :(
[0:11:00] saga_no: I think kitty bonked it
[0:11:13] jeffdmk: cash we wanted to see how long until she noticed, you ruined it
[0:11:22] Ldy50: it is the tauren who wants it
[0:11:40] Padraigah: It's the worgen guy everyone is fighting near the wine lady
[0:11:49] wolfcloudchaser80: Orc or worgen
[0:11:58] cashthb: you got it
[0:12:01] wolfcloudchaser80: The ones that get into fights with other players
[0:12:02] s_0lst1ce: it was him, the sword is gone
[0:12:12] DapherCake: If you want to know : worgen or orc. They're in combat with other players
[0:12:13] cashthb: it either the worgen or that orc, they want to try it after that
[0:13:18] 7thSaga: how do you do Challenge achieve?
[0:13:24] cashthb: yes
[0:14:21] 7thSaga: its part of Love Language achieve
[0:14:22] witchhobbit: the love boats everywhere is really cute
[0:14:29] cashthb: why is there elwynn theme in sw?
[0:14:39] Perkolate: hazel, when is your next fishing trip?
[0:15:10] witchhobbit: when its warm? :')
[0:15:20] witchhobbit: warm-er
[0:15:41] saga_no: As much as I *hate* spring (cuz pollen) ...I am still looking forward to non-freezing temperatures....
[0:15:59] saga_no: Winter's been rough here the past month
[0:16:02] witchhobbit: yeah i miss the beach, i do go during the winter time still but obviously it is not the best time to go haha
[0:16:02] fallingupwards: I'm looking forward to early summer thunderstorms
[0:16:37] cashthb: it's her desk now
[0:16:49] witchhobbit: @fallingupwards me toooo
[0:16:49] wolfcloudchaser80: I'm looking forward to longer daylight hours.
[0:16:53] GreenArrowed: i can shape a boule and that's about it
[0:17:06] saga_no: By "rough" I mean bad enough for the airport to close, public transportation to stop, and schools some places being closed for a day or two; -23C with gale winds, some areas of the country had lower temperatures and a hurricane hitting them.
[0:18:19] GreenArrowed: i use a shallow bowl with a flour sack towel
[0:18:24] cashthb: how about making a baguette 'sted of a loaf?
[0:18:49] jgbrit: Do you mean they go BAM
[0:19:03] bordum: hazel how do you go about picking a main class if you are torn between 2
[0:19:15] saga_no: The Kissy Drake
[0:19:18] wolfcloudchaser80: @saga_no Speaking of weather, when does the weather get fairly decent in Bergen? Partner and I are looking at a possible cruise that starts in London and ends in Norway.
[0:19:29] heldtheline: Aww, I love the bam.
[0:20:03] cashthb: did you take a look at the lunar festival thingy?
[0:20:03] saga_no: @wolfcloudchaser80 Define "decent" LUL - Bergen is notoriously rainy (though less rainy on average than my hometown) - lemme check
[0:20:18] bordum: your a genius thank you
[0:20:41] goplacidly56: hazelWave
[0:20:46] cashthb: it might be your favorite seasonal drake armor tho
[0:21:20] saga_no: @wolfcloudchaser80 Right now, it's -3C in Bergen so I would think in a month or so it should start to be more "springy"
[0:21:38] saga_no: So like - March should be starting to warm up decently
[0:21:42] wolfcloudchaser80: @saga_no lol, maybe at least when there's a near-zero chance of us being on a boat when one of those hurricanes are around!
[0:21:54] goplacidly56: the things from this are account wide?
[0:22:49] saga_no: @wolfcloudchaser80 I still think March and onwards (or around Easter and onwards to play it safe) should be fine
[0:22:51] goplacidly56: yeah thats what i thought
[0:23:38] jgbrit: It seems so arbitrary to make to tokens character bound. It just takes longer to get everything.
[0:23:42] cashthb: well it might be the bears dog all things considered
[0:24:02] GreenArrowed: just accidentally found a way to not do laundry, oh well
[0:24:51] wolfcloudchaser80: @saga_no Nice, we'll have to look at dates. Partner has been to Europe, but I haven't yet
[0:25:07] witchhobbit: that makes sense to me
[0:25:14] GreenArrowed: lol folding
[0:25:22] saga_no: @wolfcloudchaser80 I sent you a link on discord that might be helpful
[0:26:00] tempestmellinger1901: hi guys
[0:26:29] dahyuncatt: gl!
[0:28:19] saga_no: brb
[0:29:02] heldtheline: I think it's admirable to stick to an ethical/personal choice.
[0:29:38] heldtheline: It's Hardcore Palworld
[0:29:42] cashthb: maybe you should get a gun!
[0:30:17] jeffdmk: why dont you want a gun? does it really matter if you or your pals are doing the damage?
[0:30:32] Perkolate: i think eventually you'll get a stronger spear/sword
[0:31:13] nabilstendardo: each batch of PVP recipes were so useful for knowledge points
[0:32:03] msmester1: SoD waiting room hello LUL
[0:33:06] Blueofthenightfall: Isnt there targeting pvp members only?
[0:33:11] nabilstendardo: you still disable chat for solo shuffle?
[0:33:47] itsparvati: oh dark and purple today, love it! very shadow priest
[0:34:13] nabilstendardo: solo shuffle chat can make you lose your sanity faster than a horrific vision
[0:35:42] nabilstendardo: any hazel voicepack for arenas?
[0:35:52] psionic_reverie: what is the bam indicating?
[0:36:20] psionic_reverie: cool!ty for explaining
[0:36:26] msmester1: did you see the druid hero talents?
[0:36:39] BoogiePonderosa: be still my ticking hot
[0:36:50] sanguinette: anyone else had the gala of gifts completely vanish? Horde territory
[0:37:15] balmofgilead: Hi Hazel! Just wanted to say thanks for all the raid boss guides you've posted they have been super helpful for me and guild. Love your content :D
[0:37:38] itsparvati: i started getting back into pvp healing, only thing i changed in my druid build was flipping cat talents to bear
[0:37:40] saga_no: ....aaaaand back
[0:37:48] jeffdmk: I agree there is no reason to read about the new hero talents
[0:38:16] balmofgilead: What's your favorite healer for pvp?
[0:38:25] jeffdmk: just enjoy what you have
[0:38:46] balmofgilead: Been playing discipline which has been good fun but I'm thinking of branching out to druid and monk
[0:39:31] itsparvati: my social anxiety keeps me from trying to solo queue arena, but i have been doing well with bg healing
[0:40:31] 7thSaga: woot, im gonna have KFC later and i wanna try that new Smash Bowl Kreygasm
[0:40:49] msmester1: im kinda addicted to battleground wonder how would it feel playing it ranked
[0:40:58] saga_no: I started a new savefile in Pokémon Violet the other day, with the sole goal of catching *all the pokemon* ....I underestimated how many that is. LUL
[0:41:42] 7thSaga: @saga_no LUL
[0:41:43] itsparvati: most pvpers are too sweaty for me, i just wanna have fun
[0:42:14] cashthb: @saga_no how is the sw dex? ss was extremely lack luster
[0:42:26] 7thSaga: only rated i do is Solo Shuffle im 1550 now but im mainly Pve now a days
[0:42:35] saga_no: I think it's the same dex - the only difference is the "special" pokemon
[0:43:08] tritonxlol: try keeping lifebloom up on both ur dps 100%
[0:43:58] itsparvati: just came back after long break, i didn't realize you could change pvp conquest gear into teir and it keeps its ilvl effect
[0:44:31] 7thSaga: @saga_no  back in my day i caught all 151 Pokemons i had Blue and Red and two Gameboys and that cord thing lol i dont think Mew counts as the glitch way you know in Celadon city up north path
[0:44:58] msmester1: sometimes this looks like a pet battle 1v1 with healers ngl
[0:45:39] animematos: hey hazel you playing sod later?
[0:46:20] msmester1: you got a 50% xp buff up to 25 now
[0:46:26] animematos: oh well play what you like :)
[0:46:55] saga_no: @7thSaga Yeah - there's like 400 pokemon or something now
[0:47:07] cashthb: will you try the new final fantasy expansion? it will require 2 subs! very innovative, I wonder if blizzard will follow suit
[0:47:58] 7thSaga: im still kinda into Pokemon but i know theres like almost a 1000 pokemons O_o lol
[0:48:03] cashthb: @saga_no there's 1025 with non fully evolved ones according to pokemon db
[0:48:22] saga_no: @cashthb But only 400 *to catch*
[0:48:28] 7thSaga: Crazy LUL
[0:48:38] 7thSaga: oh :)
[0:49:12] saga_no: I found a checklist of all the pokemon to catch in Scarlet/Violet, and it listed 400
[0:49:14] 7thSaga: Hazel what would you think if thay added a pvp Brawl where you use Pve Gear? lol aurThink
[0:49:57] 7thSaga: i think it would be interesting LUL
[0:50:04] Ujai321: morning. how is everybody today?
[0:50:07] cashthb: I guess they didn't caught up with the "remodelling" yet
[0:51:01] 7thSaga: @Ujai321 im super thanks for asking!
[0:51:03] cashthb: when did you ever use boomkin form?
[0:51:18] Ujai321: if you dont use it, might as well not take it and get the decurse. that is what i did. never remembered to press hotw
[0:51:46] cashthb: yeah, mb, I tought cyclone lead there too
[0:51:51] fabianovassao: hello
[0:52:00] fabianovassao: I love your YT videos
[0:52:03] jeffdmk: the correct choice is get a wa that tells you to use it
[0:52:04] fabianovassao: congrats
[0:52:08] nabilstendardo: i would love a PVP brawl of island expedition
[0:52:09] Ujai321: @7thSaga that sounds like a song hmmm

[0:53:23] Ujai321: @7thSaga yeah, it's been a while since i heard it, but i get it :)
[0:53:33] itsparvati: it was a fun thing to do when drinking with buds late at night in bfa

[0:54:11] Ryok: i never did pvp islands either or mythic for that matter because it required a premade party iirc?
[0:54:16] heldtheline: Better plus than negative, I guess.
[0:54:22] Ujai321: one rating you (probably, who is to say) wont get to keep!
[0:54:52] Ujai321: a fun fun guy, that monk
[0:55:14] Ujai321: you get it
[0:55:15] ramzie0: Why are people queueing for the rocket boss while riding a rocket? So rude T.T
[0:55:27] frogguy84: First of all, the hair looks awesome today.  Secondly, are there anymore twitch drops that are coming up that you know of?
[0:55:38] 7thSaga: wow insteant que Lucky lol
[0:55:41] saga_no: Because they want other things from the event @ramzie0
[0:56:28] Perkolate: oh you know it. got the spelltome early and had to do a celebratory afk outside of the magetower while on it.
[0:56:33] Ujai321: you could - and this is only a suggestion, mind you - try using your eyes to find people Kappa
[0:56:56] IAmScarlett__: its the way im tempted to buy 100 pounds worth of wow tokens
[0:57:01] Ujai321: you mean THE PIRATE PATCHẞ
[0:57:04] Ujai321: *?
[0:57:18] heldtheline: I'm surprised they didn't save the parrot for that patch.
[0:57:35] Ujai321: but what if they can
[0:57:44] Ujai321: dang people are dying real quick
[0:57:52] cashthb: they will release the game in somalia/yemen
[0:58:01] IAmScarlett__: if i do that ill have a lot of gold for real
[0:58:19] heldtheline: I've heard new battleground, which would be neat.
[0:58:23] Ujai321: if it is a new event with a daily and a thing every hour,
[0:58:32] Perkolate: I mean, the skull and crossbones is obviously a hint towards the WoW + insaniquarium crossover. idk why ppl dont think so.
[0:58:36] Ujai321: i dont know, i have nothing to threaten here. i would be disappointed, tho
[0:58:55] IAmScarlett__: IAmScarlett__ watched 5 consecutive streams this month and sparked a watch streak! do these have any purpose
[0:59:06] jeffdmk: people making up wild theories does not mean the expect them to be correct
[0:59:17] Ujai321: they give you points, and maybe hazel reads em, scarlet
[0:59:40] 7thSaga: watching Hazel pvp makes me wanna pvp LUL
[0:59:45] IAmScarlett__: @Ujai321 but do they have any real point
[1:00:02] Ujai321: @Perkolate because it is obviously a One Piece crossover Kappa
[1:00:15] Saiyori: bam!
[1:00:17] picklez919: picklez919 watched 30 consecutive streams this month and sparked a watch streak! 
[1:00:36] Kaseyfullofjoy: Are you going for 2100 for the illusion? It's kinda nice!
[1:00:38] Astaroth_J: @HazelNuttyGames  hi i have a question that seems obviouse but im a pvp player and wanted to know... if i want the thorncaller claw out of raid can i get it in my vault by doing pvp stuff or do i have to do the raid 7 boss thing to have a 3 times chance at getting it in my vault thanks. and thanks for the raid guides i have cleared almost all bosses first try from your videos
[1:00:42] Ujai321: @IAmScarlett__ does anything? but also, no. just making you watch more, to keep the streak alive, and put pressure on you to not let it drop. classic marketing
[1:01:03] IAmScarlett__: @Ujai321 you're so right thank you for this information
[1:01:20] Kaseyfullofjoy: Love battle mender title!
[1:01:21] Saiyori: @Ujai321 i see your Kappa but i wouldnt even be mad lol
[1:01:32] rubibeya: rubibeya watched 7 consecutive streams this month and sparked a watch streak! 
[1:01:40] Astaroth_J: ok thanks  i dont pve so i figured as much
[1:01:47] Ujai321: @Saiyori oh, i would love it. i just dont think it's very realistic ^
[1:01:59] Astaroth_J: doing council on all difficulties to try to get it lol
[1:02:07] mdeckTV: @Astaroth_J you can get lucky with the weekly quests like the timewalking or 4 mythic quests too
[1:02:22] Ryok: @Astaroth_J the chest that you get from the timewalking / mythic dungeon weekly can also have it, the dungeon weekly should be next week again
[1:02:38] Ujai321: pressure is on, 2 rounds left
[1:03:00] Astaroth_J: Thank you
[1:03:16] Astaroth_J: @ryok ty
[1:03:23] Ujai321: you are right, i apologize
[1:03:39] IAmScarlett__: ujai is so knowledgable
[1:04:30] Ujai321: "oh wow, so you DO have defensives"
[1:04:36] Ryok: @mdeckTV oh didn't see you were faster xD
[1:04:43] murloc_queen: i want the battle mender title so badly for my healer but it seems every time i heal a solo shuffle i get flamed
[1:04:50] IAmScarlett__: sleep
[1:04:52] saga_no: "random useless bs" is mine
[1:04:53] Knocked: sleeping
[1:04:58] cashthb: ngl, most of it
[1:05:06] Perkolate: opening up tightly sealed jars
[1:05:14] murloc_queen: ohh thats smart actually!!
[1:05:16] GreenArrowed: knowledge documentation
[1:05:27] heldtheline: six degrees of kevin bacon, my pop culture knowledge is pretty good
[1:05:39] Ujai321: counter question: do you find it easy to answer that question for yourself?
[1:05:42] saga_no: Any information pertaining to my own (failing) health is a close second...
[1:05:43] Saldaris: I'm an expert in knowing that I don't know a lot of stuff
[1:05:49] kynlaeh: medicine and science which can come in handy yk
[1:05:52] kynlaeh: other than that i’m useless
[1:05:57] mdeckTV: @Ryok same info anywho!
[1:06:05] mdeckTV: just glad you got the info you were looking for
[1:06:20] 7thSaga: yeah my bank is full of junk mostly for secret pets or toys but i never do them because lazy nilsso1Shady
[1:06:23] kynlaeh: expert in kira language
[1:06:29] saga_no: Simply as a type self-preservation since I have the lived experience I then back up with medical peer-reviewed papers and such
[1:06:35] saga_no: type of*
[1:06:42] CharmingNick: lol
[1:06:42] GreenArrowed: i've been called a know it all, my adhd manifests in reading informational documentation
[1:06:43] SholiaGames: Drinking coffee/tea and doing my best lol that's all I've got
[1:07:21] Kaseyfullofjoy: Residual knowledge about beginning stuff omg I love it
[1:07:24] Ujai321: or how to cross stich owls, theoretically?
[1:07:27] 7thSaga: LUL
[1:07:33] kynlaeh: i know the ins and outs of 20 different american cities i’ve looked at moving to but i can’t decide so it keeps going
[1:07:37] saga_no: I scare the bejeesus outta my therapists because I speak like they do LUL I intentionally use clinical terms to avoid any confusion (especially for mental health) - and apparently, not a lot of psych patients do this, so my therapist describe sessions with me like "having coffee with a colleague"
[1:07:43] heldtheline: Listening to you talk about tea and aquariums way back when was so neat
[1:07:49] 0petya: I know that I know nothing

[1:07:56] JustFrogging: you built a healthy knowledge framework - sometimes people get swallowed up in the fine details
[1:07:57] Ujai321: that's fantastic news, and i'm not even being smug here
[1:08:18] MeromeHughes: random- but mango cola and sausage gravy taste weird together
[1:08:32] GreenArrowed: @saga_no yes, i do this too, so she's just started sending me psych learning material. it's actually incredibly helpful.
[1:08:52] anne42: I know quite a bit about mental health. Mainly because of personal experience
[1:08:55] Ujai321: how is moose btw? i missed updates since he felt poorly last week
[1:08:56] JustFrogging: @meromehughes my husband has been drinking those Pepsi mangos all week grossss
[1:09:36] jeffdmk: odds you finish the christmas stocking this year?
[1:09:38] heldtheline: The havoc DH having a name about nerfing vengeance is a choice. LUL
[1:09:50] saga_no: @GreenArrowed You should've seen the face of one of my psychiatrists at one point when I explained how I had Pavlov'd myself with taking a (specific) breath mint along with my emergency anxiety meds to the point where I now can subdue a budding panic attack to some extent by *only* taking the breath mint... LUL Dude was *floored*
[1:10:17] saga_no: I know I have a strong psychosomatic response, so I used that to my advantage
[1:11:13] sanguinette: Holy smokes, I just realised I can mail paracausal flakes between characters.

[1:11:27] Streamlabs: kaur_q just subscribed with Tier 1!
[1:11:51] saga_no: I find it's easier to describe something accurately if I stick to the clinical terms for things, so my therapists quickly stop with the "explain *in your own words*..." thing because they realise my own words are their words
[1:11:59] kynlaeh: hazel i made an egg plant parmesan sandwich on a ciabatta bread with an olive oil drizzle and chili flakes…. i’ve never been so proud
[1:12:52] kynlaeh: ciabatta is the supreme sandwich bread
[1:12:56] kynlaeh: in my humble opinion
[1:14:40] kynlaeh: i think i’m just nostalgic for pandaria so i love listening to the music and questing through jade forest
[1:14:43] cashthb: music was the best part of pandaria by far
[1:14:43] Perkolate: MoP music was def some of the best music
[1:14:55] Doom_Goddess: hellooo
[1:15:10] Curufin_: real close 1!
[1:16:25] Doom_Goddess: just munchin on my toast while i play wow while also watching you play wow lol :))
[1:16:41] cashthb: this one is really jarring in arena tho
[1:18:51] cashthb: 1500 time!
[1:19:36] databob1: oh no that music sounds like it's right out of kung fu panda
[1:20:24] 7thSaga: i sometimes feel bad when im in a shuffle and someone doesnt get a single win :( buuut i gotta win
[1:20:49] Qpranger2: i'm having the usall trouble of finding a Troll Rogue for the Fistful of Love achievement., must be the least played rogue in WoW
[1:21:50] witchhobbit: hahah i couldn't find an undead warrior for a long time
[1:22:02] cashthb: now that we talked about it I kind awant to play pokemon, but can't decide between the gen 1/2 remakes or us/um
[1:22:03] witchhobbit: spend some time in the feralas daily and you should come across them
[1:22:24] cashthb: nds emulators run better on android, but I got very attached to xp share
[1:22:36] fallingupwards: Do you think if someone hasn't started farming solo shuffle etc for progress twords the vicious mount theres still time this season?
[1:22:50] witchhobbit: that is how i found my undead warrior today :')
[1:22:57] itsparvati: not sure which of my alt army to level next... thinking shaman
[1:23:13] cashthb: @Qpranger2 I made a group and agreed with some dude/lass to start 1-1 for each other
[1:23:39] 7thSaga: @cashthb my fav was Gold because you battle Trainer Red
[1:24:40] WhippWhapp: 
[1:25:33] witchhobbit: the steamy romance novels in the relaxation daily are so funny
[1:26:31] kynlaeh: oh hazel i’ve been meaning to ask, how did you first find out kira’s vision was declining? my 2 year old cat recently has been missing more jumps ans it’s concerning me
[1:26:34] witchhobbit: just read them haha
[1:26:47] everjaz: gm hazel and chat
[1:26:49] WhippWhapp: The red lips are good for a few wins, for sure! ;)
[1:27:45] kynlaeh: yeah he has a vet appointment in 2 months and i’m preparing myself in case i need to spend extra on that
[1:29:17] itsparvati: big kitty yawn AWWWW
[1:29:40] databob1: yay catcam
[1:30:02] witchhobbit: awe she loves you sm
[1:30:08] BoogiePonderosa: hazelShiny hazelLurk hazelShiny
[1:30:25] itsparvati: best kitty
[1:30:26] witchhobbit: hazelShiny
[1:30:32] itsparvati: sitting so pretty for stream
[1:30:41] Ryok: i wish my cat would sit on the armrest like this D: instead he sits on the desk in front of my keyboard/mouse or the monitors D: or sits on my belly and just blocks all of it xD
[1:32:52] heldtheline: Yesterday featured a bunch of kitty bum too, that was entertaining. hazelLurk
[1:33:00] jeffdmk: the joys of pvp
[1:34:39] JackOnline: Whats a good ilvl to attempt to start joining Heroic amirdrassil?
[1:35:16] furiforever: 460-465, lower if you have a good group
[1:35:19] JackOnline: if thats the case, if got some more grinding to do! tyty
[1:35:20] gergrunt: 463-465. but ppl will expect 470+
[1:35:26] jeffdmk: are you pugging because if so you cant do it without aotc
[1:35:37] JackOnline: ya pugging
[1:36:14] JackOnline: thought so, so nothing has changed since BFA when i last played lol
[1:36:23] furiforever: Pugging will expect higher, prob 470, and without having already done AOTC it is very hard to get into a group unless you are healing or tanking
[1:36:24] jeffdmk: you just have to get lucky and apply a lot if you dont have experience
[1:37:00] furiforever: Definately have 9/9 Normal completed a few times
[1:37:02] gergrunt: obviously it’s not always easy, but I highly recommend joining a decent sized guild who does weekly runs. ppl are nicer in guilds and you won’t have to queue for hours
[1:37:36] Zuldak: Good salt filled morning to you all
[1:37:40] lordhodgy: What air purifier / dust collector thing do you have?
[1:37:48] rivalintrainingg: Cheer100 Whats your favorite Horrific vision Org or Storm?
[1:37:49] Streamlabs: rivalintrainingg has donated 100 bits!
[1:38:06] Zuldak: Another day of not getting the mount
[1:38:08] JackOnline: @rivalintrainingg storm for me
[1:39:41] heldtheline: This might be a false memory, but I think fighting Alleria felt less claustrophobic than Thrall, at least.
[1:40:21] Ryok: i definitely like SW way more than OG... mostly because i hate horde cities ^^'
[1:40:51] Ryok: i don't remember but as melee i think i prefered fighting thrall over alleria
[1:43:18] lordhodgy: Do they make a noticeable difference?
[1:44:00] xoalena: is rdruid pretty hard to learn in pvp?
[1:44:44] heldtheline: You're a feral druid now, I guess.
[1:44:46] GreenArrowed: kira wants to be a pvp pro
[1:45:06] Kamalii63: "really my kitty did it"
[1:45:28] Swordman117: Kira the ferocious feral druid!
[1:46:17] xoalena: ahhh okay ive been only a disc/holy priest healer for pvp but been looking into other healing classes :)
[1:48:20] dhezghia: Do you have the love rocket @HazelNuttyGames ?
[1:49:01] lordhodgy: @dhezghia i think she got it last year
[1:49:33] durkslag57: Yo
[1:51:03] Ujai321: how much did we gain so far?
[1:52:42] ahnn112: feels like pvp is the only content i never want to do
[1:52:47] elliongrey: BAM
[1:53:58] Maliah_N: Good fight
[1:54:20] Ujai321: percent
[1:54:28] Hulkhokie: @ahnn112 i'm right there with you
[1:54:51] everjaz: im also working for saddle and its just so miserable
[1:54:52] Ujai321: dang
[1:54:55] ahnn112: @Hulkhokie my heart breaks when the pvp color of the set is my favorite
[1:55:03] everjaz: i know rbgs are faster but at what cost
[1:55:09] Qpranger2: aarrhhh.. i need a Troll Rogue for  fistful of Love achievement, which i need for  Fool for Love achievement, which i need for What a Long , Strange Trip its been and the mount
[1:55:24] elliongrey: @everjaz increased blood pressure
[1:55:32] Ujai321: like a job or something
[1:55:36] tempestmellinger1901: I'm here in trade district
[1:55:48] cashthb: @Qpranger2 you'r on eu?
[1:56:23] Qpranger2: 1 troll for about 3 Achievements :(
[1:56:33] WowiDan: @Qpranger2 get a friend to make 1 for u thats how i got mostof those achivs
[1:56:35] Qpranger2: and a mount
[1:56:48] Hulkhokie: i'm so close to the waht a long strange trip mount, but the only stuff left is the pvp and i don't wanna >=[
[1:57:07] Hulkhokie: i think pvp in 2 events even
[1:57:10] Veranteja: the pvp was removed from the meta
[1:57:17] WowiDan: no it wasnt
[1:57:23] Hulkhokie: oooh
[1:57:26] Hulkhokie: awww
[1:57:27] WowiDan: i did mine last year and had to do 2 pvp achivs
[1:57:39] Ujai321: alicia moore pink
[1:57:42] Qpranger2: i started love fool  acievements in 2009
[1:57:56] Qpranger2: still not done lol
[1:57:57] Greggyg89: Is that an iron flask? If so I have the same one. I love that thing haha
[1:58:25] cashthb: they only removed the children's week ones I think, I had 30 min av que a few days ago....
[1:58:27] xaaia_no: I somehow got the meta two years ago, without doing the pvp-achi...didn't even notice I got it :S
[1:59:07] cashthb: @Xaaia_nor that's weird, you have to dome really specific stuff
[1:59:10] WowiDan: u had to get the one u need to kill 50 people as a gnome
[1:59:15] cashthb: *do some
[1:59:15] Postaldave: yo someone know what addon is calling stuff out ?
[1:59:17] WowiDan: the other is outside
[1:59:40] HazelNuttyGames: !ADDONS
[1:59:40] Streamlabs: Find Hazel's addon list here! https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1jzT8uXCI-9NyhTOO9Iof30PlxwyJn-uMLpEQ85Sd2Gc/edit#gid=0
[1:59:43] Greggyg89: Same hahah. When you drop it everyone like runs. It's so loud 😂😂
[1:59:59] Ryok: @WowiDan i got the meta during wrath and that achievement was the worst achievement to this day D: everytime you died while transformed you lose your transformation
[2:00:01] Postaldave: Ty
[2:00:33] heldtheline: stickers for flasks would be a neat merch idea
[2:00:46] WowiDan: @Ryok yeah but they made so the transformation last 1 hour now and last trough death
[2:00:53] Greggyg89: Agreed! It also stays super cold
[2:01:11] Ryok: @WowiDan yeah but that was way after i already got the purple protodrake ^^
[2:01:23] WowiDan: @Ryok rip XD
[2:01:25] cashthb: @Ryok honorable kills count so it's pretty quick on an epic bg nowadays
[2:02:20] Ryok: i got the what a long strange trip it's been meta back in wrath, i think first year it was available... or i might've missed an achievement and it took an extra year? i don't remember d:
[2:02:27] Ryok: D: * i'd have to login to check ^^'
[2:04:04] Vilt: but theyre fish, how can they not resist water?
[2:04:21] WowiDan: WowiDan subscribed with Prime. 
[2:04:21] Streamlabs: wowidan just subscribed with Twitch Prime!
[2:04:24] saga_no: I kinda want to start a sticker collection book - like a nice notebook to put stickers in - and then "reward" myself with some cheap stickers whenever I leave the house to do errands...
[2:05:02] cashthb: @saga_no you could go for stamps then
[2:05:22] saga_no: @cashthb Too expensive
[2:05:32] saga_no: And the whole point is to buy the stickers when I'm out
[2:05:39] heldtheline: @saga_no there's something to be said for treating yourself; I'm a grown woman and I've found that gold stars for doing my chores is a good motivator
[2:05:46] Ryok: huh nevermind i'm WAY off D: apparently i got it in july of 2011 D: i could've sworn i got it during wrath... well i got the gnome pvp achievement in 2008 maybe that's what i remembered merodyHmm
[2:06:01] saga_no: @heldtheline Yeah exactly
[2:06:57] saga_no: I get so mentally and physically fatigued by going out in public (it's been worse the past few months, so I've implemented fidget toys and noise sensitivity earplugs) that I need SOME sort of dopamine to entice me
[2:06:59] everjaz: @saga_no this is so cute and i love it
[2:07:15] everjaz: everjaLOVE
[2:07:21] cashthb: sounds like it's time to swap to palworld
[2:07:41] tempestmellinger1901: hazelWave
[2:07:50] Felixu_: hii
[2:07:51] heldtheline: I still think Kira is trying to tell you to go feral
[2:07:53] everjaz: my social anxiety reached peak when i started apprenticing as a dog groomer in a salon of clique-y women and it was so hard for me
[2:07:55] gregoryvamosi: heylo
[2:07:57] tempestmellinger1901: good u
[2:08:16] yein_: BTW what is the baem sound LuvPeekR
[2:08:18] saga_no: @everjaz Right? It satisfies the collector in me, it's cheap enough for me to actually be able to do, and it's just.. fun.
[2:08:59] anvi117: hi! omg hazel love love love that wig!!
[2:09:26] cashthb: btw the focus range is really impressive
[2:09:32] saga_no: (Speaking of earplugs, I'm sure everyone has seen the ads for Loop ...10/10 do recommend. They actually work.)
[2:09:51] kybakii: how come you wear wigs so often now? (i love them, i was just wondering)
[2:10:01] everjaz: ive been wanting a pair of loop plugs for so long
[2:10:29] gregoryvamosi: Oh Loop!
[2:11:04] kynlaeh: do you wear them bc partner snores? if so thats a good idea and i need some
[2:11:42] saga_no: Most earplugs irritate my ears, but the Loop ones don't (provided I have put the correct size tip on them) - I have "Quiet" for sleep (whole plug is silicone and soft-ish) and "Engage" for everything else (hard plastic base plugs with silicone tips)
[2:11:50] Taacoo2: Taacoo2 subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 6 months! Loving the wigs!
[2:11:50] Streamlabs: taacoo2 just subscribed with Twitch Prime!
[2:12:31] kynlaeh: currently i drown out the snoring with 3 fans in the room lol
[2:12:33] gregoryvamosi: I can agree, definitely need to get a pair soon for myself too
[2:12:39] Felixu_: okayyy
[2:13:13] gregoryvamosi: Hehe!
[2:13:44] saga_no: The Engage plugs remove the frequencies of sound that hurt my ears / makes me more exhausted; I still hear everything fine
[2:13:49] kynlaeh: my dog wines in her sleep and does little like muffled woofs its interesting
[2:14:23] saga_no: But like .. I also hear the electricity in lightbulbs sometimes, so my ears are all over the place, heh
[2:15:02] kynlaeh: man this is a long que for healer
[2:15:22] cashthb: maybe you should do a bg, that's also pvp!
[2:15:33] saga_no: Oh btw @HazelNuttyGames I'll be dipping out early tomorrow; have a Session 0 of a potential new D&D group lined up
[2:16:10] saga_no: I know - I Just ...feel inclined to give a heads up that I don't intend to go on a new hiatus LUL
[2:16:33] kynlaeh: i just got a new insurance company for my car, it’s such a headache and anxiety inducing process
[2:16:51] heldtheline: We would accept Kira as a viable substitute hazelShiny  just sayin'
[2:17:06] jeffdmk: That is an interesting take that we dont know you because in some ways we know you and in some we dont
[2:18:00] anvi117: thats gotta be pet abuse! hahaa
[2:18:03] databob1: nah he's good like acupuncture
[2:18:10] saga_no: Haha. [ full pretzel mode ] Back be damned. LUL
[2:18:28] databob1: mmm needles no way
[2:18:48] zenruso_: cat :)
[2:19:10] saga_no: Acupuncture needles are extremely thin so you're not likely to feel them (unless you're getting a muscle knot sorted out - you might feel that)
[2:19:38] saga_no: That said - I do not have firsthand experience with them
[2:20:04] saga_no: Because I don't like being touched over prolonged periods of time by strangers
[2:20:37] saga_no: (I can deal with getting waxed and such because it's like 10 minutes)
[2:20:44] Beckzmed: playing a healer- chain cc for 15s straight
[2:22:18] MadManDoctor: Been a while since I have been here and Kira is fighting her sleep meowno1SmokyLove meowno1SmokyLove meowno1SmokyLove
[2:22:24] lomb___: Heyo Hazel! :)
[2:24:34] Hulkhokie: i've had acupuncture, i didn't feel anything
[2:25:45] saga_no: You just want to *compete* for the sake of competing?
[2:25:47] Hulkhokie: i hate healing, i hate pvp, but if i have to pvp i like healing the best :P
[2:25:56] pulsarone: pulsarone watched 3 consecutive streams this month and sparked a watch streak! 
[2:26:46] cashthb: ...I was just about to complain about healers being too strong but you killed my mood
[2:26:52] cashthb: you're doing alright tho
[2:27:07] heldtheline: this might not help but I think that we all see how hard you work; with streaming and videos and everything, we see how much heart you put into everything you do
[2:27:58] saga_no: I suppose PvP is a more direct-input "number go up" thing too; you see results right away
[2:28:23] databob1: I know what you mean I'm coming up on a year of being unemployment and I can't find a job that will work with my health limitations I've been feeling really worthless over it
[2:28:41] blissy416: do you have any thoughts on the new holy/disc hero tree?
[2:29:39] blissy416: i wish i didnt look either
[2:30:06] GreenArrowed: anxious to see the warlock trees
[2:30:10] CurrentsWoW: Kira sitting on the armrest like "yes destroy the mortals, write thy cat masters name in their blood"
[2:30:13] saga_no: Maybe I should make 2024 the year I finally get into PvP ...
[2:30:25] saga_no: I reached my AOTC/KSM goals I set for myself last year
[2:33:33] Kretyn: @saga_no Go for ksh!
[2:33:50] saga_no: Question is - do I stick with what I know (Spriest) - or... do I roll a class I've never really played and just force myself to PvP with it?
[2:33:52] cashthb: the healer getting locked down for like half a year a everyone being on full hp while there's a 20% heal reduction is soo bad... how can people say it's fine. this is worse than mop was!
[2:34:07] saga_no: @Kretyn Nah... I'd sooner Mythic raid than go for KSH
[2:34:13] cashthb: @saga_no learn heal, no question
[2:34:28] Kretyn: @saga_no Why's that?
[2:34:29] saga_no: @cashthb Why tho?
[2:34:36] cashthb: sure it's gonan take a few weeks to learn disc... but that's still shorter than the average dps que
[2:34:47] saga_no: @Kretyn Less pressure in raid (for me personally) than keys.
[2:35:10] saga_no: @cashthb But then I would have to heal in PvP and what If I don't want to heal... ? Yaknow?
[2:35:51] Kretyn: @saga_no That's fair.  Though this is a free season, with it being exceptionally easier than past seasons.  Next season will be harder
[2:36:23] saga_no: @Kretyn Well, I still haven't completed AOTC for Amirdrassil... because I haven't played in like 2 months
[2:36:30] cashthb: @saga_no well we won't know untill you try, also: dps que made *me* go healer and I'm the biggest frost mage purist there is
[2:36:49] saga_no: @cashthb That's the difference between you and me ... I don't care how long the queue is.
[2:37:05] Kretyn: @saga_no You said you had aotc though, no?
[2:37:12] saga_no: @Kretyn Yah. Last season
[2:38:00] saga_no: As in the previous raid... heh
[2:38:00] Kretyn: @saga_no Oh.  Then get it this season :P
[2:38:26] saga_no: @Kretyn I'm not stressing about it... it was a goal for 2023; I achieved it in 2023
[2:38:35] heldtheline: Kira is a difficulty mode all on her own.
[2:38:45] cashthb: shadow should be fine then, if you're really result driven you might want to look into arms, dunno how good it is rn, but it easy, real' easy
[2:39:14] saga_no: I know I can raid Heroic; I know I can force myself to get KSM; I don't really need to get AOTC multiple times
[2:40:08] saga_no: (I'm 7/9 Heroic in Amirdrassil so getting AOTC would be within reach - I'm just not *stressing* about it... )
[2:40:16] cashthb: not even 1500
[2:40:54] cashthb: moonglade port to check out the drake armor myb?
[2:42:13] cashthb: I actually kinda like the mage one; it has a lot of proc stuff -> proc stuff dislikes glacial spike -> I dislike glacial spike -> I like proc stuff
[2:42:32] Ryok: when's DH talents merodySad we're gonna be the last again like always right? D:
[2:43:31] RTSLightning: Share my feathers???
[2:43:40] RTSLightning: Never
[2:43:40] Kretyn: I hate the feathers :P
[2:44:07] cashthb: my only issues is I don't know if frost fire bolt will generate icicles, it did, and if it doesn't it's pretty much dead on arrival... return
[2:44:37] kynlaeh: in an interview they said it rotates every second and when you press it it freezes on one that you can use for the next 12 seconds
[2:44:42] kynlaeh: if that makes sense
[2:44:44] mcxoney: what are these? :D
[2:45:03] saga_no: They haven't released the talents for Shadow yet?
[2:45:07] databob1: wish they would make the feather direct target
[2:45:16] mcxoney: oh i see
[2:45:38] Kretyn: I'm scared for pally :O
[2:47:11] saga_no: I mean, I know already that I'll go Voidweaver because ...tentacles... but I'm still curious ;P
[2:48:26] kynlaeh: i didn’t like the sound of it tbh
[2:48:32] cashthb: that cognitive load sentence is the worst thing I ever read
[2:48:33] kynlaeh: as a priest main
[2:48:34] murloc_queen: it sounds like the priest version of hpal blessings
[2:49:24] saga_no: Let's hope Jak et al screams enough into the void for Blizz to rethink things
[2:49:28] kynlaeh: that’s what the equates it to @murloc_queen  but on every second instead of cast
[2:50:00] saga_no: (And that Voidweaver isn't affected by it, ehehe)
[2:50:02] Timetaco: @HazelNuttyGames do you have any plans on playing SoD?
[2:50:09] databob1: I'd really rather they added class cosmetic custumization so I can make my abilities look how I want
[2:50:31] kynlaeh: see ya hazel
