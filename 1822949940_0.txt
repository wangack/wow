[5:50:00] TheCliffyShow: I always hear them say they want cross faction to only be content where you choose who to group with so people aren't forced to group with people of the opposite faction if they don't want to. Which is fucking stupid.
[5:50:59] hammack52: @hammack52 yeah i dont buy it, either they just dont want to put the man hours on it or they just dont care, either way they will give some sort of BS excuse to not have to do it, cause other games have figured it out way before they did plus they have it with pvp so explain that one
[5:51:24] Cower311: ive nvr had any issues with cross faction queing. only issues ive seen is communicating after the dung or before in /say chat and whispers
[5:51:44] 91Niki: @hammack52 You a game dev or coder?
[5:51:58] Nazzguul: Cross faction matchmaking should be as simple as a check box to enable or disable
[5:52:11] 91Niki: Yeah it's not that simple LUL
[5:52:22] Cower311: @Nazzguul why lol
[5:52:35] 91Niki: Coding and game development isn't as easy as just checking a box lol
[5:52:43] 91Niki: That is just NOT how it works
[5:52:46] Nazzguul: Why not? It doesn't hurt having the option available.
[5:53:00] Attackroot: the box would of alreaady had to been there from the beginning justto check it.
[5:53:14] Cower311: @Nazzguul to limit the amount of ppl you can play with? why would you do that to yourself lol
[5:53:27] Nazzguul: I am not trying to imply it's easy to implement. Just saying if implemented, that would be an easy way to do it and not confuse people
[5:53:56] xantoor: killing
[5:54:01] BlueBlurPrime: why lfr? for Tmog?
[5:54:06] Cower311: ive also nvr done lfr so maybe thats where the queing problems are. and heroic dungs
[5:54:22] Nazzguul: @Nazzguul Personally I wouldn't disable it, cross faction is great for the folks I tend to play with
[5:54:47] 3663Sharad: It's dumb but also good, because it helps lower M+. But it sucks für the vault to run lower keys
[5:54:47] xantoor: was goign to join on allaince toon but then got jumped while swithcing lol
