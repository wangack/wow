[7:31:56] BoT_sLoThy: @HikazeYattis what?
[7:31:59] eachtheirpwn: I guess I wonder if Dayz is good as a survival game since there's not an end game, just guns to shoot people. Why not just play a BR? Or a survival game where ppl dont shoot on sight?

[9:04:56] StreamElements: @steviejoe66, The reason why shroud streams at 936p is because twitch's bitrate cannot handle 1080p quality. 936p is better overall looking and quality wise than 1080p at the same bitrate.
[9:04:58] stonedjesusx: @mofino 0 clue, still talks.. U do know that amd parts are higher quality and cost more then the intel counterpart? srsly. stop the bullshit and inform urself about it b4 u talk.
