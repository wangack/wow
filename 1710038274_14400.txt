Well now you already have the big blind in for free with any 2 cards. small blind can call half price with worse hands than normal. Plus anyone else might just be like its only 1.  You almost have to raise if your want to play in the hand just to get worse cards out. Imagine you only bet blinds and big blind has 72o only to flop 722
