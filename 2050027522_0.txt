[0:07:29] Somanie: O SHIT
[0:07:44] Theo300: I personally can drink energy drinks up until like an hour before bed with no issue. Probably because of all the pre-workout I used to take when bodybuilding

[0:11:49] Zeniticon: sparks is the problem
[0:11:54] wackpoetic: I made another Monk to only be Fistweaver and I ended up playing caster MW instead because some shuffle lobbies are just unplayable as Fistweaver
[0:12:17] DrWarz: solo q time is awful
[0:12:20] pmakewow: rukiCool
[0:12:27] rudeleface: There is no shot that they are going to do it until next patch but IMO it would be a big help to make BG Blitz ranked NOW

[0:13:31] theronpaul: I thought that's what he was gonna do
[0:13:54] Somanie: If it's not a bot, he should be ashamed of himself farming the room while his shaman buddy gets fucked
[0:14:09] Somanie: Madge
[0:14:11] wackpoetic: I've been grinding on full crit Tauren caster MW and I like it. You get so much mana from tea with crit

[0:25:28] shogun2022: people will abuse the reporting system after walking the line of being such toxic dickheads but not bannable
[0:25:35] Magottx: @wackpoetic lol ive been playign warrior only now, not sure if that helps my case raging
[0:25:37] Luigicamp: I got 48h suspension back in TBC, let's just go with "for no reasons..." Kappa
[0:25:54] wackpoetic: Instant Reports in Solo Shuffle: 1. DH who says anything negative, 2. Sub Rogue who complains about stun DR
[0:26:02] nutz_hang_uneven: can we get classic tbc back

[0:27:30] wackpoetic: the shoulders were OMEGA BIS
[0:27:30] shogun2022: thats why I got banned for a week lol
[0:27:41] kozlodui: Is there any AWC today ?
[0:28:03] Somanie: There was a warlock on Turalyon for a long time that verbally abused every belf he saw
[0:28:03] nutz_hang_uneven: shadowlands >>>
[0:28:39] wackpoetic: ya the tier set wording is confusion, it actually casts a Throw Glaive it's not just a free proc
[0:28:50] wackpoetic: confusing*
[0:28:56] nutz_hang_uneven: favorite hockey team?
[0:29:08] rexcist: any awc surprises so far?
[0:29:12] Badasti: hmm i think this xf3 touring rocket is now useless with dragon riding right?
[0:29:36] Somanie: @badasti does it not fly dynamically ??
[0:30:06] wEiRdO_dUdE: Frost DK actually killed some people, that was a surprise to me
[0:30:15] Koraszdormu: What's good, Ven.  How you doing today brother?
[0:30:17] rekt1370: nahj lost to frost dk LUL
[0:30:18] parker00100: the outlaw rogues goin nuts

[0:30:30] warm_soda_: touch it Pog
[0:30:31] Badasti: god damnit
[0:30:35] rekt1370: we alread ythink that its okay KEKW
[0:30:37] macdeezyx: cmon ven dont tease us
[0:30:53] Badasti: thats a god damn fat
[0:30:54] Badasti: fact
[0:30:54] Judgejobrown: the only comp for arcan was rmd
[0:30:59] Darty12111: arcane mage is hard to play imo
[0:31:08] ShaHugs: everyone complains about destro
[0:31:08] rekt1370: the warriors control twitter
[0:31:10] heymomimonttv: tbh i understand where ur coming from, as ele main lol. i think ur correct
[0:31:30] wEiRdO_dUdE: Kubzy on arcane mage is something else, though
[0:31:30] Moobot: YouTube channel: youtube.com/venruki * Subscribe for new content!
[0:31:38] Koraszdormu: My complaints still focus primarily on the amount of spammable CC with no CD's still in the game.  And Rogues.  Fucking Rogues...
[0:31:39] kusoneko: salt was right
[0:31:39] jfspace: Think people havent had a chance to complain about SP yet cus it just caught buffs right?
[0:31:41] dickman911: grain of salt
[0:31:47] Somanie: Sand KEKW
[0:31:47] Explicitx: grain of sodium
[0:32:00] yippey_: Mornin Ven!
[0:32:14] wEiRdO_dUdE: Yeah Wizk was rocking on SP
[0:32:24] heymomimonttv: kubzy on arcane is the same as swapxy on ele. a great player will make their class as op as possible, like wiz on sp. there's a player for all these classes that makes the spec seem like a god spec
[0:32:25] Koraszdormu: SPriest is a ton of fun.  I've enjoyed it even pre-buffs TBH.  I always enjoy Spriest, though.  Feels like playing a Sorc in SWTOR.
[0:32:44] joe_g_433: Hey ven. is Aug seen much in pvp. or even viable?
[0:32:52] Darty12111: feel like 7500 honour takes forever
[0:33:11] CptGlocktopus: are you sure you can win 10 arenas Ven??
[0:33:29] demtrollzZ: @Koraszdormu spriests are life
[0:33:49] wEiRdO_dUdE: Flightstones from doing stuff, WQs or Mythic+ and a lot of the newer quests
[0:34:23] Caszatic: @venruki what class do you think has a higher skill cap rogue or mage?
[0:34:30] Applezbtw: good morning
[0:34:45] rekt1370: rogue higher
[0:34:51] Darty12111: Outlaw rogue pretty tough to play
[0:34:52] Caszatic: @venruki btw good morning
[0:34:56] rekt1370: rogue has to do and can do way more
[0:34:58] Badasti: Apples... that sounds like the name of a horse
[0:35:15] potkopvp: mage for sure, rogue setup isnt as hard as following up on the setup
[0:35:32] wEiRdO_dUdE: A rogue basically controlling the match is a very high skill cap, true
[0:35:45] rekt1370: rogue having to cc eveyone doing the setup
[0:36:07] potkopvp: rogue doesnt have to avoid all the stops
[0:36:09] Koraszdormu: #Cheatthesystem
[0:36:20] Arubicon: Morning Ven
[0:36:27] Saitistreamy: can you see the deleted messages?
[0:36:42] Saitistreamy: Master is roughly glad
[0:36:46] Saitistreamy: no click distrbution
[0:36:53] wEiRdO_dUdE: A curve like that makes sense to me
[0:37:03] Saitistreamy: one is a bell curve
[0:37:05] Saitistreamy: like acctually
[0:37:05] gdodmebxu: not that different at all
[0:37:07] primejusticegaming: yo what up ven
[0:37:17] Saitistreamy: No
[0:37:17] mezzery_: 1900 is the big outlier
[0:37:22] Foe009: curious to see shuffle chart
[0:37:23] mezzery_: but not bad
[0:37:23] Saitistreamy: green and blue would be sequal
[0:37:31] iamreallyafan: when does awc start
[0:37:32] gdodmebxu: with more players it'd look a bit more like a bell curve
[0:37:35] wackpoetic: is that CR or MMR? because you start at 1500 MMR
[0:37:35] zinisterzz: you can tell the sample size is massively different
[0:37:37] zinisterzz: from the data
[0:37:38] Caszatic: @venruki thats cause of all the carries at 1800-2k mmr range
[0:37:41] zinisterzz: its not a good comparison
[0:37:56] Saitistreamy: as a stats curve this is more like the greens are correalted
[0:38:03] Caszatic: @venruki i know alot of r1s that sit in that mmr to boost ppl for xmogs
[0:38:04] nutz_hang_uneven: 1400 and 2k are hilariously easy, but the boosting is another thing
[0:38:27] Nateypww: I love venruki
[0:38:27] Badasti: such a cooked comment
[0:38:30] SlogreTheOgre: 2k is pretty high rated when u look at the broad scope of players...
[0:38:42] wEiRdO_dUdE: pet battles pog
[0:38:47] Koraszdormu: I'll be honest, my buddy and I are clawing our way through 1700.  Almost at 1800, but it's fucking ROUGH right now.
[0:38:51] kyriewow: y
[0:39:03] Foe009: 1800 is hilariously difficult as an enhancement shaman
[0:39:17] Punkapin: yeah i swear 1500mmr games feel like blizzcon game 7's
[0:39:41] SlogreTheOgre: @Foe009 just go ele for ez 1800 :(
[0:39:46] CrazyJoeDavola57: i played blood dk a few times and i got alot of angry people message me
[0:39:46] What_ln_Tarnation: Robokap

[0:40:42] wEiRdO_dUdE: Her turned around like what
[0:40:43] SlogreTheOgre: all you dh players are the same D:
[0:40:44] Saitistreamy: The reasont hese are so messed up is the % of players falling in each section
[0:40:57] heymomimonttv: @SlogreTheOgre i cant say ele is ez 1800. its def tough to make it out of 1500-1600 on ele, for me at least. been my main for 3 seasons now, never seen 1800 on it but i'm 1800 on a few alts
[0:41:01] knappster15: It's okay to kill a lowbie once, but don't farm them
[0:41:02] SlogreTheOgre: thats exactly what a dh main would say >:(
[0:41:09] Saitistreamy: the 10,500 players in green
[0:41:12] SparkleRainbow_: i was the guy who flew away get rekt KEKW
[0:41:36] knappster15: LUL LUL
[0:41:38] Punkapin: LUL

[0:41:42] wEiRdO_dUdE: The world PvP stuff is often hilarious
[0:41:57] Nonversations: this binch always ignores me lol. sigh.
[0:42:19] Foe009: I hit 1800 as an enahnce last season and it was sweaty, this season I'm soaking in sweet...
[0:42:24] wEiRdO_dUdE: Camping that duck quest when it was up, fighting all kinds of people
[0:42:26] Nonversations: I DO!!!
[0:42:28] TheBoysCT: mornin' coffee time, yessir
[0:42:30] mezzery_: nonversations is the main character
[0:42:33] heavygoomba: does this mean ven is excited for shadowlands classic
[0:42:35] SlogreTheOgre: @heymomimonttv Thats fair. Calling any spec "ez 1800" is probably too dismissive anyways. I just find ele to be so much easier than enh in arena. Like a 300 cr difference lol
[0:42:39] Darty12111: unexpected wholesome
[0:42:40] Gajing: say it back Madge
[0:42:42] Matty802: PotFriend
[0:42:58] nutz_hang_uneven: bfa classic would be gas
[0:42:59] happyheals: BFA Classic will be litr
[0:43:00] fugginhiding: hop into torghast, we need to grind the skele mage renown
[0:43:01] artist_i: BFA classic will be great for all of players to skip it
[0:43:02] wEiRdO_dUdE: Shadowlands Classic is not going to be bad, it will be based off how it was at the end
[0:43:02] Foe009: corrupted rogues.... ewwwww
[0:43:04] knappster15: I actually miss corruption shenanigans
[0:43:04] happyheals: lit
[0:43:06] Darty12111: cata 4.3 rogue and enh shammy is what i want =3
[0:43:10] Caszatic: @venruki im excited for MoP Mage again with Deep Freeze
[0:43:12] YoMamaSoFine69: 80% haste gpie
[0:43:14] SlogreTheOgre: I didnt play BFA so id be down :D
[0:43:17] ezmoney3434: corruption was the worst ever in the game
[0:43:20] CrazyJoeDavola57: was fun for sure
[0:43:20] zinisterzz: when there was a vendor it was fun
[0:43:22] knappster15: When BFA classic launches it'll probably start with the corruption vendor there

[0:43:23] ShaHugs: I never got to try having full bis corruptions
[0:43:27] LeBigNose: wtf D:

[0:46:35] tv_raz: oh no the dh fever got ven
[0:46:35] Saitistreamy: So the breakdown between middle range CR and the outside, is 17k middle range, to 7k outtlier ranges
[0:46:40] Saitistreamy: those numbers should be closer to 50-50
[0:46:50] Saitistreamy: thats a crazy unbalanced curve

[0:53:44] Saitistreamy: Ven, look at the solo shuffle distribution vs, COD, it is an asburd difference for what should look similar
[0:53:44] nutz_hang_uneven: glazing your self
[0:53:50] chronicfuels: lvled up my demon hunter like 2 weeks ago. Hard stuck at 1700 in SS at the moment
[0:54:15] SlogreTheOgre: @chronicfuels have u tried equipping pvp gear? Kappa
[0:54:20] Xeliumimar: @chronicfuels are all your buttons on your action bars?
[0:54:40] nutz_hang_uneven: @chronicfuels have you tried opening your eyes
[0:54:44] demtrollzZ: @Saitistreamy already checked it out a bit ago
[0:54:44] chronicfuels: Such based advice. Ty gangsters FeelsAmazingMan
[0:54:49] SlogreTheOgre: lmao
[0:55:06] chronicfuels: i play a couple games a day. first xpac i played dh
[0:55:18] ShaHugs: rip priest carry

[0:55:33] zinisterzz: you can beat the priest I believe
[0:55:55] Foe009: DH mode, lol
[0:55:57] Roxxybolts: GOD THAT WAS A GOOD STORY
[0:56:03] Saitistreamy: @demtrollzZ he looked at 3s, Solo shuffle is ridculous bunched, and falls off a cliff
[0:56:04] Roxxybolts: narrated by a true DH
[0:56:04] Fury73: Can you yell at them like Crusader?
[0:56:07] Badasti: great story, loved the plot and character development
[0:56:08] CptGlocktopus: WHATS THE SEQUEL
[0:56:13] iamreallyafan: guys, how do i watch his vod
[0:56:23] demtrollzZ: @Saitistreamy oh ok
[0:56:27] Saitistreamy: but RIGHT NOW is the time to have those convos very publicily, because the new president overtly is looking at social media
[0:56:41] Saitistreamy: like NOW is the time to drop the "suggestions for pvp videos" in mass
[0:56:44] Saitistreamy: by content creators
[0:56:47] nutz_hang_uneven: lmao
[0:57:00] Saitistreamy: Dont get me wrong, it likely wont do much
[0:57:09] nutz_hang_uneven: bruv they dont give a shit about what the public thinks
[0:57:11] Saitistreamy: but if it ever matters, now is
[0:57:19] nutz_hang_uneven: only care about shareholders
[0:57:34] Saitistreamy: COD exists by cacving to its player base in the form of memes
[0:57:37] Saitistreamy: all day
[0:57:49] SlogreTheOgre: @chronicfuels joking aside the damage is easy part of dh. You usuing utility? 2x stuns, imprision, fear, purge, Darkness all win games for u :D

[0:59:33] chronicfuels: @SlogreTheOgre yeah, my main focus is using defensives accordingly. consistently pulling 70k + dps. Can't believe i haven't played dh before. Too fun
[0:59:48] knucklez2291: Cheers bud, all time favorite content, maybe alongside Xar
[1:00:06] Saitistreamy: @Joh_Burg is basically only following Blizzard content creators on twitter, and has posted about wanting to hear the issues that should be adjusted
[1:00:14] Saitistreamy: 100% now is the time for the fix pvp heres how video
[1:00:34] knappster15: another 40 minute que? LUL
[1:00:36] fugginhiding: can you show what this season's weapon enchant is?
[1:00:42] chronicfuels: @SlogreTheOgre It'
[1:01:00] chronicfuels: it's nice not getting trained all day on DH. I main hunter @SlogreTheOgre
[1:01:02] tv_raz: last night the queues were poppin
[1:01:16] kusoneko: Kappa
[1:01:25] GaryTTV: I don't play DH at all and I got 1800 in FIVE shuffle lobbies. Litearlly 30 rounds played
[1:01:31] zinisterzz: what dps gets focused the least in arean? dh?
[1:01:31] Moobot: Latest video "The Casual PvP Community Is Begging For Help" view it here: youtu.be/ztKSy4IjNfo
[1:01:55] Telarius1: depends what rating
[1:01:59] Badasti: def
[1:02:00] CinematX: war
[1:02:04] Telarius1: at high when u face a sub they just go u
[1:02:05] ShaHugs: blur is broken af into melee
[1:02:08] Lemurion1: destro locks :)
[1:02:10] nameyourform: arcane mage
[1:02:12] arcane_p: dh and resto druid
[1:02:13] Telarius1: an wiz
[1:02:25] wEiRdO_dUdE: The tank specs often get ignored, I think
[1:02:27] Badasti: doesnt DH have like a passive 20% magic reduction or smth?
[1:02:28] CinematX: no one goes wars or dhs
[1:02:28] Taevenx: shammy? I wonder if leeka can pull this info lol
[1:02:29] arcane_p: rogue
[1:02:38] Telarius1: in my exp. i dont get trained on my dh until u get to like 2.5+
[1:02:43] Telarius1: then sometimes
[1:02:56] Saitistreamy: Someone on worldofpvp posts it,  unsure where it is
[1:03:01] Saitistreamy: my guess is its puilling from wow arena logs
[1:03:05] demtrollzZ: Usually the class that I currently play dies the most in my games. Blizzard really needs to fix this!
[1:03:29] iamreallyafan: @venruki how do i watch ur vod?
[1:03:34] arcane_p: thatâ€™s actually very good to know especially for new players because getting trained like a shaman or balance Druid sucks
[1:03:35] Lemurion1: stop playing feral :)
[1:03:39] Dwilk20: @Badasti Tats are 8% you would have get certain talents to increase you magic resistance and its only during a sigil for a few seconds
[1:03:41] demtrollzZ: @iamreallyafan click on the name below the video

[1:03:51] knappster15: first blood stats
[1:03:53] privx: lots of cool stuff on trading post this month
[1:04:18] wEiRdO_dUdE: Like that DK was saying, getting hammered on forced him to use heals so much it dropped his damage
[1:04:35] arcane_p: oh yea I forgot hunter is up there
[1:04:36] biofreaks: warrior or dh
[1:04:47] gdodmebxu: dh outlaw KEKW
[1:04:51] Telarius1: hows it all look as u change the rating
[1:04:54] Badasti: thats because all DH players are the best players in WOW
[1:04:56] tv_raz: wow
[1:04:58] zinisterzz: by alot
[1:05:00] tv_raz: who would have guessed
[1:05:02] Badasti: they do the most dam and die the least because only the best players play them
[1:05:04] ShaHugs: dh has 3% magic damage reduction and 5% physical in one point, and shamans get 6% magic reduction for two points, absolute scam
[1:05:32] biofreaks: They both have a decent amount of defensive cds.. DH and outlaw
[1:05:34] Telarius1: thats not true.
[1:05:36] gdodmebxu: tattoo passive
[1:05:37] Dwilk20: Immolation Aura gives you move Armor
[1:05:38] gdodmebxu: for magic dmg
[1:05:39] knappster15: Blur on a 1 min cd
[1:05:39] dyenamikz: they have like 20%
[1:05:41] Telarius1: Dh has 15% passive magic reduction.
[1:05:43] Zeniticon: passive lifesteal
[1:05:44] Telarius1: Minimum.
[1:05:52] millennialmurphy: it is their crazy leech
[1:05:52] arcane_p: @venruki can you please explain to me why dh is viable competitively? I canâ€™t understand it
[1:05:59] Telarius1: It used to be 25%, nerfed 15%
[1:06:00] arcane_p: is not
[1:06:06] swolecolemole: was miserable playing tsg for our glad, we rerolled ret/dh and are almost there within a week...essence break on the HoJ feels crispy
[1:06:18] Telarius1: However, u also have 5% physical dam reduction, and multiple immo auras give u armor.
[1:06:19] tv_raz: dh go burrrrr
[1:06:25] knappster15: You can blur every go basically
[1:06:33] Badasti: their cd's are really strong imo, blur first go, darkness next, blur again, nether walk basically an ice block, blur off cd again... Whole time passively healing with leach etc. Zippidy zoom all over the map at mach 10 etc
[1:06:35] arcane_p: oh I didnâ€™t watch eu
[1:06:45] CptGlocktopus: are there still qualifiers today?
[1:06:52] Lemurion1: what is crazy for me is dh surviving all these patches without nerfs
[1:06:53] callexy95: i played couple of dh dev and met mirror 3 times in raw couple of days ago xD
[1:06:59] arcane_p: NA no one plays it competitively it seems, only outlaw rogue
[1:06:59] YoMamaSoFine69: what is the dif between outlaw/desto and ele/dh ?
[1:07:00] ShaHugs: feel like dh does too much damage for their uptime too
[1:07:03] Telarius1: THey do die.
[1:07:04] hulkdieselx: i wish they would just gut DH for the rest of this xpac. absolutely miserable
[1:07:13] Telarius1: But dh is slippery, and low exp players dont know how to kill
[1:07:14] skez_live: i feel like its the mobility and defensives to get them outta shit
[1:07:19] Telarius1: But they are tanky yes
[1:07:21] iTarnish_: can you show feral
[1:07:23] knappster15: I think there's a perception they dont die, so no one trains them in shuffle
[1:07:26] heymomimonttv: dh dies if they're really bad and just zug the whole time with no cd's
[1:07:30] wEiRdO_dUdE: Havoc getting metamorphosis seems a little sketch
[1:07:30] drdoomkinx: Check 2k plus
[1:07:31] tv_raz: they have infinite movement insanely high damage
[1:07:31] ralotheret: if you play double dps in 2â€™s they die
[1:07:34] ab_stract_: !song

[1:07:34] zinisterzz: they sure no how to kill ddestro lol
[1:07:36] ShaHugs: high xp players can't kill dh either, it's basically impossible without insane damp/stuns
[1:07:38] OGTweeter: hunters are good into dh
[1:07:42] kreyzy8: they just gave them the rework, they can't nerf them or else all the re-rollers will quit
[1:07:42] Lemurion1: I saw a demon hunter die once. He forgot to glide and died from fall damage
[1:07:52] biofreaks: blood dk pog
[1:07:54] callexy95: Blood dk stonk! 0%
[1:07:56] callexy95: jk
[1:07:58] skez_live: @Lemurion1 be honest it was you... wasnt it
[1:08:23] Badasti: the problem is there is no complexity to them, even their defensive play requires no complexity like worrying about purges, or being kited or dispelled or whatever
[1:08:28] Lemurion1: @skez_live no, it was a random in random dg. But ngl i did it on evoker LUL
[1:08:31] drdoomkinx: Wss that boomy at 71%?
[1:08:35] macdeezyx: you think draco cleave can cheese their way to the top?
[1:08:37] skez_live: @Lemurion1 same!
[1:08:43] Badasti: why is netherwalk a  better iceblock for example that cant be dispelled and allows them to reposition
[1:08:45] hulkdieselx: i have 2 arena partners who play DH and its absolutely sickening listening to them brag about their SS rating lol
[1:08:47] Protties: just started watching the PvP casual open letter vid.
[1:08:49] marvin1995xo: i heard players complainging avbout feral hahah
[1:08:50] kreyzy8: boomy does get farmed in melee lobbies
[1:08:54] Telarius1: its only my anectode for it. but alot of players have a perception to just never train them. as u got higher. people begin to try. rogues as example almost always will do go on dh to kill. but u dont see sub do well until higher cr
[1:08:54] revzzz1: @venruki Hey ven! :D PogChamp Good to see u again!
[1:08:55] tv_raz: wheres ww on that list
[1:09:01] Telarius1: but thats just my personal exp no real data
[1:09:06] tv_raz: 41%
[1:09:11] Zeniticon: under ele
[1:09:19] Bakhadi: time to buff bear form
[1:09:30] knappster15: BM hunter being so low surprises me
[1:09:30] Bakhadi: make it give 360% armor again
[1:09:33] twitchara7: VEN no sod xD
[1:09:35] Badasti: ah demon hunters dont have a high death rate because of mass psychosis
[1:09:44] YoMamaSoFine69: do you need the addon to be in those statistics?
[1:09:47] Badasti: its never the class, always everyone else playing the game lUL
[1:09:48] tv_raz: if a dh rotates cds its nearly impossible
[1:09:51] Protties: i think the more people talk about casual pvp experience, the betterâ€¦ classic era 2.0
[1:09:51] flames222: if a dh knows how to trade, definitely hard
[1:09:58] neoxue: look at Comp Performance and I feel like it's a better representation on who they rather go than DH
[1:10:15] Badasti: tahts coz unlike other classes DH dies to stuns Kappa
[1:10:20] gotham_kr: Sub rogues and MM hunters
[1:10:21] wEiRdO_dUdE: EU and their DH meta supports the idea it is tougher than the average
[1:10:22] heymomimonttv: one of the few times ive seen dh die was because he dispelled UA off himself at like 20%
[1:10:28] veuvex: blur on 1min + nether + dark, then add healers CDs, a lot to rotate through. Short window to kill for uncoordinated SS teams
[1:10:30] GoldenKnightStd: thats not because dh takes no damage, they heal a lot with leech, if they dont hit anything, they die very fast
[1:10:37] Dwilk20: I dont agree with that Mages dont
[1:10:39] Telarius1: not everything dies in stuns as easy as other tho
[1:10:44] wicked_wizurd: it's a combo of them being tough to kill and no one wanting to even try to kill them
[1:10:46] Dwilk20: Locks deal with stuns goes from Rogues well
[1:10:46] Zeniticon: it depends on lobby too
[1:10:48] Dwilk20: same with Spriests
[1:10:49] Telarius1: Cuz of auto-defensive or defensive useable while stunned
[1:10:58] OCDGaming90: Heyo all :)
[1:11:03] GoldenKnightStd: dh have no passive reduction, what do tyou mean lol
[1:11:04] tv_raz: you clearly havent played a ww monk against a rogue if you think nothing else dies in stuns xD
[1:11:04] revzzz1: Disgusting class dh is LUL LUL
[1:11:07] swolecolemole: one of the few specs with a 1 min wall too
[1:11:10] OCDGaming90: doing goodie my dood!
[1:11:13] Lemurion1: it's me on the violin btw
[1:11:15] Telarius1: they do @GoldenKnightStd
[1:11:18] biofreaks: DH is fun to play too. More classes should be designed like it now a days.. not a ton of button bloat
[1:11:24] gelatokush: dh has 7% passive magic dmg reduct and 5% phys
[1:11:32] addyz0r: Hi ven and chat
[1:11:34] Telarius1: Armor from Immo aura. 5% physical reduc from passive. 15% minimum magical.
[1:11:35] likeewlock: all the defenders rn
[1:11:37] Telarius1: @GoldenKnightStd
[1:11:48] nutz_hang_uneven: the armor is crazy
[1:11:51] Telarius1: 4% vers talent on dh tree near top-mid
[1:11:58] Dwilk20: 4% vers and threat reduction on Havoc side
[1:12:15] macdeezyx: a magic dispell
[1:12:16] callexy95: + they got alot of leech
[1:12:19] gelatokush: usually its 10% magic reduct but they play demonskin witch is -3% magic + 5% phys
[1:12:22] Telarius1: i think the immo aura is around like 2.5% phys reduction per immo aura
[1:12:30] Ronn_Deezy: a glimpse if used right
[1:12:33] tv_raz: would you say they have the best mobility?
[1:12:43] Dwilk20: No OUtlaw
[1:12:46] callexy95: i think thats mage
[1:12:48] addyz0r: rogues does imo
[1:12:49] Lemurion1: and now they are playing colective anguish again, so more healing
[1:12:50] arcane_p: yes
[1:12:53] tv_raz: mage isnt close to dhs
[1:12:58] JNE14: what is up with wow plates feel like leather and leather feels like plates.....
[1:13:01] arcane_p: there dash is on a 6 second cooldown
[1:13:01] tv_raz: outlaw is the right answer xD
[1:13:11] arcane_p: and they have 2 charges
[1:13:13] Dwilk20: Arcane mages are as mobile in arena as DHs lol
[1:13:17] Telarius1: its 8 @arcane_p  if talented for 20% reduc
[1:13:28] wicked_wizurd: as a destro main I think it's time we stop training destros and give these dh's a piece of our mind!
[1:13:31] BMaStream: I've never done a pet battle
[1:13:31] drdoomkinx: Doesnt outlaw have 40 percent passice move apeed?
[1:13:33] BMaStream: What is this
[1:13:36] arcane_p: my fault 8second cd
[1:13:58] JNE14: DK and wars are squichy compared to rougues and dhs
[1:13:59] Dwilk20: WW monks are as mobile as DHs
[1:14:05] Dwilk20: in raw movement
[1:14:09] nutz_hang_uneven: dh rn basically has demon Armour that locks had in bfa when it was op
[1:14:09] callexy95: rly rly hate mages on my dev drake xD
[1:14:09] GoldenKnightStd: @arcane_p the problem with this comparison is because dh are afected by roots right, the mage mobility is with blinks, so u can actually move even rooted
[1:14:10] wEiRdO_dUdE: trader's tender
[1:14:20] Roxxybolts: double warrior DH frost mage lobby is not fun as a FW
[1:14:21] tv_raz: dks are very squishy
[1:14:26] revzzz1: Kappa Kappa
[1:14:34] YesitsSuper: DH can jump over a ring of piece btw monks cant Kappa
[1:14:39] Dwilk20: NO warriors are not squishy
[1:14:42] Telarius1: The main change DH recieved in their rework that made them tanky is actually giving them Demonic Appitie as a passive instead of talent. The amount of healing increased by like x2
[1:14:47] Telarius1: Never existed in build sprior
[1:14:55] Mrshmyt: susceptible to hard swaps out of defensive but thats about it
[1:14:55] dyenamikz: @Roxxybolts Wait were you just in that SS i was in
[1:14:58] GoldenKnightStd: @Telarius1 thats very true
[1:14:59] JNE14: arms warrior
[1:15:01] privx: if a class isnt' immortal then its squishy for some ppl
[1:15:08] OGTweeter: only when you zugg zugg into crap loads of dam
[1:15:11] ItsBees: Pet battles?! Pog
[1:15:12] Badasti: netherwalk = ice block 2.0
[1:15:15] Dwilk20: Nether walk isnt free
[1:15:19] Telarius1: Well u took netherwalk anyways usually. U just had to give up 5% dam
[1:15:27] Dwilk20: they just put it in a way you could get it and it be useful
[1:15:31] Telarius1: So had to choose 5% dam or defesnive
[1:15:32] Dwilk20: Ignore pain is free lol
[1:15:36] Dwilk20: Shockwave is free
[1:15:48] Dwilk20: Impending Victory is free lol
[1:15:50] Badasti: by that logic ice block isnt free either
[1:16:03] Telarius1: Ven is right. 1 of the biggest things mentioned to devs was Netherwalk being a 5% dps loss to take
[1:16:06] nutz_hang_uneven: this fucking guy
[1:16:12] knappster15: Glimpse is also INSANE
[1:16:20] revzzz1: LUL LUL
[1:16:21] BMaStream: Isn't netherwalk mandatory to get down to the good damage on the left side of the tree?
[1:16:32] likeewlock: glimpse is annyoing
[1:16:35] GoldenKnightStd: @knappster15 but very high skill cap
[1:16:39] gelatokush: dh went from the worst melee to the best or 2nd best melee id say it was a good rework
[1:16:44] marvin1995xo: was there any sursprise in the awc qualy ?
[1:16:48] BMaStream: Literally MANDATORY
[1:16:52] Dwilk20: Go look where Die By the Sword is on warrior
[1:17:01] Telarius1: u cant go eyebeam build
[1:17:05] Telarius1: its so bad lol
[1:17:08] Telarius1: without last season teir.
[1:17:16] qabraa: whats major ability on DH  ?
[1:17:19] Telarius1: u get nether for free
[1:17:25] prometheusx47: gm ven
[1:17:27] Aduka84: even with last seasons tier, eyebeam was bad
[1:17:33] zozoqc: Do you find it normal that people that didnt even achieved r1 once is participating to the tournement ? idk if u disccused that before?
[1:17:39] prometheusx47: are there more qualifiers today?
[1:18:00] Telarius1: Essentially Dh getting Soul Sigil + Demonic Origins (They were talents un-used before, cuz hard to get in tree) gives u spam 10% hp healing.
[1:18:03] Telarius1: That can crit.
[1:18:06] Telarius1: per soul
[1:18:08] Aduka84: they need to make this seasons tier with casting throw glaive from blade dance just baseline in war within
[1:18:08] nutz_hang_uneven: he just wants to be right
[1:18:15] fullmetal030: Demon Hunters are straight up hard to kill not sure lol
[1:18:15] Telarius1: Demonic appitite*

[1:18:22] nutz_hang_uneven: discord admin vibes
[1:18:25] Aduka84: after this tier, i literally dont want to feel like i have to ever press throw glaive again
[1:18:26] happyheals: also different trees *
[1:18:30] revzzz1: Time to watch crusader again for the good laugh ven? Kappa LUL
[1:18:32] happyheals: no comparison
[1:18:44] likeewlock: fishing
[1:18:49] Telarius1: @ShaHugs  netherwalk isnt why dh is immortal.
[1:18:55] Telarius1: Or tanky.
[1:18:55] wEiRdO_dUdE: Yeah fishing is one
[1:19:09] Telarius1: its that they went from 0 soul shard healing. To 1 billion.
[1:19:12] likeewlock: there was always gishing why not now
[1:19:14] ShaHugs: @Telarius1 ?
[1:19:20] likeewlock: *fishing
[1:19:23] whitewallss: Played couple shuffles against crusader yesterday. I went back watched his vod of it and my god is that man interesting lol
[1:19:23] ShaHugs: why you @ me lol
[1:19:27] Badasti: @Telarius1 thatd be like asying ice block doesnt contribute to mage survivability
[1:19:28] Telarius1: You get a shard when you purge (10% heal) shard when you chaos strike (10% heal again) Shard when you use any sigil (another 10% heal)
[1:19:35] Telarius1: legit spam 10% heal
[1:19:54] Telarius1: DH tree, passive talent.
[1:20:00] Telarius1: DH spell book.
[1:20:20] Telarius1: havoc spellbook, demonic appitite.
[1:20:26] dubbfiend: buff DH nerf arcane
[1:20:31] wEiRdO_dUdE: Strong tattoos
[1:20:43] spacemanwx: BRO WTF
[1:20:48] revzzz1: LUL LUL
[1:20:49] gelatokush: chad dh class
[1:20:49] drdoomkinx: i think thats nerfed in pvp to 7%
[1:20:53] spacemanwx: it actually is your tattoes what reduces magical damage? no way
[1:20:54] Telarius1: But all ur sigils give u a soul too.
[1:20:55] JNE14: man I don't know but this wow meta really left me with a bad tates un my mouth. Not that happy about it. Normally I complain about x and y but right now is stupid
[1:20:55] spacemanwx: ROFL
[1:20:57] ShaHugs: is tattoos an ability or is that just always up?
[1:20:59] nutz_hang_uneven: thats been a thing for a long time
[1:20:59] zUg_zUg_: SMOrc
[1:21:01] gotham_kr: Fury warriors also have tatoos
[1:21:05] Telarius1: And then blood moon pvp talent. As well. So u have spam heal.
[1:21:13] Tyferious: @venruki What's your rotation as DH?
[1:21:16] Telarius1: Yes
[1:21:26] spacemanwx: aoe purge
[1:21:32] chronicfuels: i play bloodmoon. purge op
[1:21:33] Telarius1: RNG  chance. proc 20% heal. And if u purge a demon you get gaurenteed demon soul
[1:21:35] Dwilk20: Depends on what you face
[1:21:37] Telarius1: 20% dam*
[1:21:40] Taevenx: wonder how much they're nerfed in PvP
[1:21:44] klikka: half of dh abilites are just lock ability recolors
[1:21:46] Dwilk20: You cant lock it in cause you need Reverse
[1:21:58] biofreaks: Do you think aff lock isnt as bad  as made out to be?
[1:22:21] gelatokush: I luv dh great class super well designed no wonder its one of the most played class :D
[1:22:24] nikthevoker: cosmetic sanc
[1:22:40] fullmetal030: shaman + tremor
[1:22:45] fullmetal030: infuriating when they dont press
[1:22:46] skez_live: isnt Glimpse one of the biggest things making DH tanky with 35% reduction every what 20 seconds?
[1:22:50] Dwilk20: Ret Sanc is massively easier to use than Reverse magic lol though Sanc is too easy to run
[1:23:03] Badasti: the thing that I've always thought about that class is that blizzard baked so much shit into single abilities with no drawbacks
[1:23:09] gelatokush: its hard to die i agree they are tanky but id rather be immortal then a liability
[1:23:17] nutz_hang_uneven: nah the passive dr is outrageous no class should have that much passive dr
[1:23:17] ATHLTE: morning ven, hope you're mornings off to a good start!
[1:23:18] zachgamegodx: i thought u were taking today ff so i didnt check
[1:23:24] drdoomkinx: 80% of classes are immortal no?
[1:23:40] spiderman28282828: what with a sub rogue? :P
[1:23:47] drdoomkinx: comp depentdent ofc
[1:24:10] Telarius1: its crazy that dh is tanky. but thne u look at outlaw and it makes it look like a joke
[1:24:12] JNE14: look at ferals they have become a literal liability
[1:24:36] OGTweeter: so what is golden guardians new team name?
[1:24:36] wEiRdO_dUdE: Poor ferals, talk about a victim spec
[1:25:08] nutz_hang_uneven: classes that frail should always have high dmg
[1:25:10] revzzz1: Feral :(
[1:25:14] Dwilk20: @OGTweeter The Move
[1:25:15] ALLtheEXP: Does that show their chance of BEING the first blood kill?

[1:25:38] OGTweeter: @dwilk20 ty
[1:25:38] ALLtheEXP: okay i'm caugh tup
[1:25:40] nightmxz: Oh die first? I thought that would be kill first
[1:25:40] Telarius1: Does it not show the other rounds?
[1:25:45] Telarius1: That could be big context.
[1:25:48] gidzlol: is the meistro out of the race?
[1:25:51] wEiRdO_dUdE: I can believe enhancement is up there
[1:25:54] joyrex_j9: ferals have to play out of their fucking minds to even be able to play the game
[1:25:54] revzzz1: LUL LUL LUL  KEKW
[1:25:55] drdoomkinx: outlaw cant die sooo
[1:25:55] heymomimonttv: i think first blood is just that they get hit first / are first target. not first kill
[1:25:57] drdoomkinx: unless they int
[1:26:11] pitzprod: The miestro presses on
[1:26:11] revzzz1: DinoDance DinoDance DinoDance
[1:26:15] hooqs: @heymomimonttv its kill brother
[1:26:15] nightmxz: I think that also goes along with natural synergy with healers, like mages have terrible synergy with rsham and mediocre with prevoker
[1:26:16] Gradyolson1: isnt first blood first to get a kill
[1:26:24] Stoichulk: Ven, new AWC trailer on Blizzards Youtube: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZBW8-vLS6M
[1:26:26] Telarius1: First blood is legit in all other games first kill
[1:26:29] Telarius1: lollol
[1:26:30] nightmxz: DHs can be healed well by any healer
[1:26:31] zinisterzz: first blood means first to die or get a kill in every game lol
[1:26:31] Zeniticon: is it 1st kill of the lobby ?
[1:26:37] JNE14: yeah man but the rep is comparatively smaller for outlaw that DH
[1:26:38] lowluds: first blood is death
[1:26:40] Badasti: first blood is first death, always has been
[1:26:41] marvin1995xo: its death
[1:26:43] wEiRdO_dUdE: Ferals and boomkins are often stealthed until after someone gets opened on
[1:26:45] Scottiss88: Are the qualifiers finished? Or more today?
[1:26:47] Telarius1: What im curious about is why they dont show any of the other rounds.
[1:26:49] bulgarian_beefer: in every fps first blood is the person who gets the first kill
[1:26:54] heymomimonttv: if there's only 1 kill per round tho, it wouldnt make sense for it to be first death because there is no second death
[1:26:57] ALLtheEXP: @bulgarian_beefer yes
[1:26:57] knappster15: Thank goodness they nerfed Boomy survivability
[1:27:00] revzzz1: DinoDance DinoDance DinoDance DinoDance DinoDance
[1:27:05] llseattlell: dev burst is 286k.....
[1:27:06] malvarcla: first blood = first kill
[1:27:08] marvin1995xo: everything should be at around 50 % first blood
[1:27:12] ryanblue98: @heymomimonttv there is no "first kill" in solo its over with one death
[1:27:13] marvin1995xo: except healers
[1:27:20] seanwheeler823: LUL
[1:27:23] Ashrow: @heymomimonttv multiple kills can happen in shuffle under some conditions
[1:27:27] Zeniticon: 2xkill
[1:27:33] heymomimonttv: @ryanblue98 thats what im saying, so calling it "first blood" and saying it's first kill when it's only kill isnt making sense to me
[1:27:34] Zeniticon: double kill *
[1:27:39] zachgamegodx: the ppl need to be using the app for the data to get recorded
[1:27:40] nutz_hang_uneven: sort by matches

[1:27:50] hooqs: @heymomimonttv bro they are the first target to die man its really simple
[1:27:51] Scottiss88: Are the qualifiers finished? Or more on today?
[1:27:51] OGTweeter: comp performance for solo shuffle would be cool to see

[2:19:55] dropbombsss: got dc'd twice in shuff and ended up going 0-6 cause of it :)
[2:20:03] nikthevoker: i had to cave and get turbo
[2:20:22] MaximumnNeo: i mean it really is crazy that 2200 is that high
[2:20:26] kreyzy8: the top of the shuffle ladder hasn't gone up in like 3 weeks
[2:20:29] MaximumnNeo: 2200 in the past has been like 5%
[2:20:35] Spaceberry_McDuck: @MaximumnNeo wait, so my dumb ass at 2100 is actually pretty good?
[2:20:36] Sinizster24: play spriest ven
[2:20:37] nikthevoker: its worse then watching tv now
[2:20:41] Saitistreamy: @MaximumnNeo rank % across the board is legit bad but it isnt helped by people thinkign 2.2k should be top 3%
[2:20:41] kreyzy8: and most healers R1 hasn't gone up in a month
[2:20:45] Magottx: I havenâ€™t dcd once in 6 months and had that just in shuffle too like 3 times this week. Always when Iâ€™m like 3-0 too and the rest of my internet is fine
[2:20:47] Iplayvideagames: you should heal awc
[2:20:47] MaximumnNeo: @Spaceberry_McDuck if your 2100 in shuffle on a healer you are doing well
[2:20:59] ferahgok: based
[2:21:13] NovaSun84: for 1700?  KEKW
[2:21:13] Saitistreamy: people dont get that wow breaks at 2.4 and 2.2 , at 1 and 3% is no where clsoe to a bell curve
[2:21:20] bobbybigbuxx: what is actually insane is that DH have been nerfed 3 times and they still have the most output ever.
[2:21:27] Spaceberry_McDuck: well hot damn, i'm pretty good trash. like some trash you can trade in for money. like copper

[2:23:02] imrobk: lol im jk. i know there's more to it
[2:23:04] NovaSun84: ya the levels are so good for it considering it's all your own computers
[2:23:04] Magottx: Wow this guys really only working a few hours before work. Slacker
[2:23:18] Saitistreamy: what % of players should be 1,100mmr?
[2:23:20] NovaSun84: you could sell that pre-check for sure
[2:23:23] arcane_p: what blizzards employees do you have access to and can they get mage buffed?
[2:23:33] arcane_p: at the rehearsal
[2:23:33] happyheals: imagine taking off work just to work
[2:24:03] nightmxz: Fire needs a damage overhaul
[2:24:28] NovaSun84: he would start by Being born Good I'd assume carmelaKappa
[2:24:52] dooshken: Fire feels awkward to play for me
[2:24:52] arcane_p: yo the paladins name is â€œkitemedaddy â€œ lmao
[2:24:59] nightmxz: I think buff ignite damage and nerf mastery so you can do  better DoT damage, buff scorch to be relevant outside of execute. buff Fireball and fire blast as well and maybe reduce fire blast charges to 2?
[2:25:00] prometheusx47: it all started when he was born and the doctors said - he is good
[2:25:03] psychic241: q'd into borngood last night in 2s and he did indeed just run circles round the pillar
[2:25:14] dyenamikz: @prometheusx47 LUL

[2:25:55] arcane_p: make fire mage tanky again Iâ€™m sorry thatâ€™s when I had the most fun when I was immortal
[2:26:03] NovaSun84: awc team**
[2:26:06] Voriq: Gnomobility when
[2:26:35] nightmxz: Being immortal passively is toxic, being immortal from control and kiting is sick :)
