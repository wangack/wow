[0:51:06] Gamerhcp: GIGACHAD tbh

[0:52:17] Nox1o: Its kinda weird, especially because I feel like the competition is what keeps the RWF alive. i dont think id watch more than a few minutes a day without the close fight for 1st
[0:52:20] panacer: no shot thats enforceable
[0:52:29] BipolarPongal: CAUGHT

[0:52:41] sorostrike: @Maximum being a pro player, does 2.7k io make me semi-pro?
[0:52:41] rindioh: I think its because all the stuff you build up (strats around the game) doesn’t belong to the guilds, its all blizzard property
[0:52:48] Verothe3rd: contract lawyer tier list

[1:32:00] zerossussy: u can but u get tired af
[1:32:03] Shakesy12: I tried Keto for a few months and it ruined my stomach. Had to go on gastritis medication and had no energy
[1:32:04] magemaster225: load up on cafffeiene before workout
[1:32:11] heysafety: your body adjust to burning fat for fuel, which is the part of keto. Which can work short term, but is HORRIBLE for you long term.
[1:32:11] ffian1: You get used to it
[1:32:12] nathkin: a lot of fat, your body uses fat instead
[1:32:14] deadhead922: I did keto for 2 years and it's very hard. Slow burn exercise and chemical stimulants
[1:32:17] Omekoba: You literally don't. If you're motivated enough to exercise you don't need to diet like that
[1:32:18] xVTechnique: keto was originally designed for cancer patients
[1:32:26] Shakakahn9: cut the workout in half. eating extra fats to burn fat better is literally the same as just a normal caloric deficit
[1:32:28] dirtyhagus: Need to enter full ketosis, then ketone bodies can be broken down to stabilize blood glucose
[1:32:30] seazunn: intermittent fasting is a life changer
[1:32:32] NeccoTL: you can do low intensity cardio, like 130 or less bpm
[1:32:34] GodKingMuninn: on keto you don't workout
[1:32:40] JackOfAllApocalypses: 400 grams of carbs is only 1600 calories
[1:32:44] xVTechnique: anyone who is saying “you burn more fat” on keto doesn’t understand the science of metabolism.
[1:32:45] wraghelm: Deficit matters for weight loss, diet matters for energy
[1:32:48] hajrudinthegiant: to lose weight sure but does that make you healthy?
[1:32:51] Zlynnt: When I lost 100 pounds my diet was like 70% carbs KEKW
[1:32:56] Lothland: Keto works for people because it limits their calories without them knowing because of the hard carb cap which is what fk'ed them to begin with
[1:32:57] heysafety: im at 230g of carbs a day cutting, currently down 18 lbs
[1:33:05] mindyah: you 100% can workout on keto
[1:33:17] emesaye: way more energy when u avoid carbs
[1:33:20] ColdIceCreamMan: it takes a few days before you body goes into ketogenesis then you have more energy reserves freed from the fats and you can exercise but not in the way as you do with carbs
[1:33:24] Its_Big_Tone: you def still work out on keto, you have minimal carbs not 0 carbs
[1:33:24] deuurr: people work outy on a carnivore diet
[1:33:35] Shakakahn9: pizza?
[1:33:36] TheItalianStallion321: yeah i dont have any bread when i eat and i still workout. my only day of bread is Sunday, my cheat day
[1:33:38] seazunn: red baron pizza?
[1:33:38] Twicetimes: i'm nodding in agreement at all the good health advice while also about to go eat a bunch of cheese and bread when i should be going to bed
[1:33:38] infraredpen: frozen pizza
[1:33:40] Korentice: 10.2.6 is a red baron collab confirmed
[1:33:41] TheItalianStallion321: and i have plenty of energy
[1:33:42] opticon82: Your body is also quite happy burning muscle when working out with no carbs... so that's not great either!
[1:33:43] slappadabas5: I like pizza way too much to give a shit about carbs
[1:33:44] Zlynnt: I could never do carnivore diet KEKW holy shit that's depressing
[1:33:46] Rzayers: Max is dogfighting someone tomorrow?
[1:33:48] shammmay: Pretty sure you can get to a point with Keto where your body can start to process protein into sugar. I think its called protein glucogenisis or something I can't remember
[1:33:49] miraagex: I'm no expert, but read in a number sources than cycling carbs burns fat a lot. Like day1 no carbs, day2 half usual intake, day3 full carbs, day4 0, rinse, repeat
[1:33:51] xVTechnique: I’m a bodybuilding coach, just flexible dieting is by far the best, and most sustainable diet you can do.
[1:33:52] waldoishere: Airplane video game? Gonna leak government secrets too?
[1:33:52] Spartany25: fasted workouts burns calories at a faster rate, past the 20 hour mark
[1:33:54] wraghelm: Max I loved the newest episode of the PoddyC - Planning to use the future episodes to listen to at the dentist bc I hate it and it makes me anxious
[1:33:57] sim967: the red baron?  obviously a pizza reference
[1:33:57] ThisIzD: I knew a dude who ate mcdonalds every day, smoked a pack a day and ran like 6 miles a day and he was always in crazy good shape.
[1:34:07] misfitstv1: when you cut out carb (truly cut them out sub 25 carbs a day) then you fall into ketosis, it’s a state where your body uses fats as as its primary energy source (the calories basically work like a carb)
[1:34:20] grimzero617: Is it best of 3 or best or 5?
[1:34:23] mysduck: you should get epic pen so you can write/draw on your screen
[1:34:39] xVTechnique: @miraagex No
[1:34:45] wraghelm: Hey Max huge shoutout to how good the PoddyC has been - Using next wks episode to get me through the dentist which makes me turbo anxious
[1:35:01] MBG_95: Max I DM'd you a website that does all this for you

[1:48:26] Drenwow: true tho
[1:48:27] UnheardGrace: the last poddy c was such a banger
[1:48:38] fat_european0: I feel like Classic Cata & MoP will be easier to play since you can 10man in them
[1:48:40] rilsolo: just finished the poddy c with ven, cant wait for the WA discussion
[1:48:41] Clush___: @Maximum theres literally no way we're getting classic shadowlands one day right, where does it stop
[1:48:42] cabita31: tier 11 is so lit
[1:48:42] wraghelm: I loved Venruki's take. I went and played 3's for the first time with friends last night and it was TURBO fun actually

[1:48:51] chubbytheboi: I want MoP SV so bad
[1:48:59] lucid_wow: im so excited for classic dragonflight guys
[1:49:02] XerisGG: they'll go to Legion prob
[1:49:03] UnheardGrace: I'd play classic SL
[1:49:04] reggiepowa: whats wrong with classic shadowlands with all the changes from the start
[1:49:05] Zlynnt: classic shadowlands KEKW
[1:49:14] GandelionWhite: classic MOP
[1:49:16] Eiya: reptar in his little ball look at him, so cute
[1:49:18] enigmasvea: stops with mop
[1:49:19] Rampo123: yes :)
[1:49:20] lucid_wow: @reggiepowa unironically i would play this
[1:49:22] misran: i honestly never thought they'd go past wrath
[1:49:23] RandaIFire: bro classic bfa would go crazy rn
[1:49:24] fat_european0: Classic BFA Prayge
[1:49:25] Viisionz74: They stop at MoP nobody wants to play WoD
[1:49:26] berchberkins: i wanna play shadowlands again
[1:49:26] misfitstv1: probably sound like a broke record but is liquid have 5 people in other teams why isn’t there a team liquid?
[1:49:28] brian_777777777: maybe they stop at legion that would be good with me
[1:49:29] Slapsstick: @Eiya he cinnamon roll
[1:49:29] fronkacean: classic shadowlands is gonna go so crazy
[1:49:29] b1azzuris: i hope they do Classic WoD
[1:49:31] StarShopping95: Classic should have a server that goes through vanilla, BC and Wrath over a 2.5 year cycle.
[1:49:32] smolderdaddyuwu: classic legion?
[1:49:34] sarrowzthewarlock: id prob play if it gets to legion]
[1:49:35] VxForxVirindi: i thought they shoulda stopped with WoTLK imo
[1:49:35] b1azzuris: that shit is so nostalgic ofr me
[1:49:36] zenkodac: imo people would play all the way to bfa
[1:49:41] zenkodac: for corruption again
[1:49:41] Eiya: @Slapsstick lil cwassont
[1:49:41] enigmasvea: ends with classic mop
[1:49:42] TheItalianStallion321: id play the fuckin shit out of Classic Legion
[1:49:42] B__May: Start over and make every patch 1 week long
[1:49:42] soccerflow11: shadowlands s1 but you can swap covenants
[1:49:42] GandelionWhite: classic Legion would be sick no?
[1:49:43] lucid_wow: no troll i would play classic slands with free covenant swapping and no conduit energy and stuff from the start
[1:49:45] CanielD: Mop and legion will pop off
[1:49:45] Drenwow: they will stop at mop no legion sadge
[1:49:47] Robsnow_901: monkaW itll never stop
[1:49:47] Osterberg501: "Classic" style wow ends with cata honestly. Game changed a lot after.
[1:49:47] swagggle: there's no way they keep going through BFA
[1:49:47] thisisthotcaller: BFA??? whaaaaaaaat
[1:49:47] Yslingshot: Classic Islands Pog
[1:49:48] wackpoetic: I miss WoD I can't wait to have a Farmville again
[1:49:49] JWallace: classic shadowlands
[1:49:51] eazye812: bring back AP
[1:49:53] Clarius: SL Classic KEKW
[1:49:53] NDRandell: There is no shot they'll do wod
[1:49:54] CasualNicholas: BFA will only be good if they play it all on the s4 patch
[1:49:55] Basic_3: Classic seems incompatible with M+
[1:49:55] odificiency: wtf is a "wellness shot" o.o
[1:49:56] Nox1o: after the corr vendor
[1:49:57] Nox1o: yes
[1:49:57] macfisker: bfa with corruptions for the whole xpac would slap
[1:49:57] bareuheldig: legion with the lego fixes at the start instead of the end
[1:49:58] SniggleJake572: I 100% would
[1:50:00] bigmeanbeefy: Again BFA, had some stellar raid, and M+ was pretty good to
[1:50:00] tempehst11: legion with last patch from the start might be sick
[1:50:02] Vlaxter: bfa 1st raid was goooood
[1:50:02] asd123qwerty1: making use of that headrest i see, dave the relax man @Maximum
[1:50:03] GrimFandango: Corruption vendor, no rotation tho
[1:50:06] Zlynnt: classic dragonflight
[1:50:07] reggiepowa: they will do all the changes from end of the expansion at start, we wont need to play through a year of broken and bad systems
[1:50:08] Its_Big_Tone: classic should have ended in WOTLK, they shoulda called it something diff
[1:50:10] Slapsstick: give me classic bfa in 8.3 patch and ill be hype
[1:50:12] caveman2x: classic RWF SOFO Aware
[1:50:13] Oracle_WoW: its just 2 cycles of wow now. og and cycle 2. in 5 years they spin up another
[1:50:14] zenkodac: imagine playing legion and bfa with everything fixed from the start goated expacs
[1:50:18] honeychonker: They could just add the PvE side of classic into retail
[1:50:18] chubbytheboi: Of course they will do each exp as classic. They wanna milk the nostalgia money
[1:50:22] cabita31: when we pass to modern era raid do you think the raid will have RWFs?
[1:50:23] b1azzuris: yeah in classic it feels so bad sometimes once you finish raid your done for the week
[1:50:24] bigmeanbeefy: Hell id argue BFA had better seasons of M+ than Dragonflight.
[1:50:25] Variekz: Then just merge the things that you got on classic with retail once it catches up Kappa
[1:50:30] cabita31: like real ones instead of the 4h stuff
[1:50:32] Jumanjiqt: I just want to play all the expansions I missed
[1:50:34] lucid_wow: @cabita31 no shot
[1:50:36] smolderdaddyuwu: bfa for sure good now right? in hindsight? @Maximum
[1:50:36] ItMeMatt: gear swapping mid dungeon in legion m+ Aware
[1:50:41] zenkodac: no stupid rng lego farm no stupid azorite BS
[1:50:42] miraagex: i wanna see wotlk classic playing progging prenerf mythic anduin
[1:50:46] berchberkins: they made such good M+ dungeons in shadowlands, i feel like the quality has gone down a lot since adding old dungeons
[1:50:46] Jumanjiqt: from when I quit in og Wotlk until Shadowlands came out
[1:50:49] caveman2x: i miss uhr
[1:50:50] Nox1o: bfa also had banger dungeons
[1:50:51] southy97: beguiling kek
[1:50:51] StarShopping95: YEP bring back Reaping
[1:50:51] RandaIFire: s2 s4 roasted
[1:50:52] thattrokdude: POSTURE CHECK
[1:50:54] fat_european0: the dungeons were overall really good as well
[1:50:56] heffdogga: legion classic would slap with that leggo vender system
[1:50:57] Shirey12: I can't believe Asmon scrolled past your video and turned around and simped to you and then changed the subject
[1:51:00] R_Bak3r: s1 seasonal was a stinker
[1:51:01] Zingerac: can't wait to do infested in BFA classic
[1:51:03] Aquadriel: BEGULING GOATED
[1:51:05] Viisionz74: BRING ME BACK URH :(
[1:51:06] RandaIFire: s1 s3 were bad s3 was carried by essences
[1:51:10] Ruinx81: Wouldn’t everyone have retail accounts by the time they get to legion?
[1:51:10] Noxara_: Do you like this mount?
[1:51:18] Archerone: They could do bfa with s4 on from day one and it would own.
[1:51:19] Troniin: @Maximum is there any expansion where raids wont be cleared on the first day in a few hours?
[1:51:19] gellehar: infested was terrible
[1:51:19] lucid_wow: encrypted is still the best seasonal affix to date debate a wall
[1:51:24] RandaIFire: essences hard carried s3 to being somewhat playable but holy that affix was bad
[1:51:29] StarShopping95: @lucid_wow no shot
[1:51:31] Viisionz74: FUCK YEAH
[1:51:35] Noxara_: Awakened was top tier
[1:51:35] Viisionz74: Encrypted is so good
[1:51:36] caveman2x: encrypted was so good
[1:51:45] infraredpen: i didn't like encrypted

[1:52:02] ItMeMatt: the routing you could do with awakened was so nice
[1:52:06] Thickynugnug: LOVED encrypted
[1:52:07] Slapsstick: imagine encrypted during corruptions, that buff would go crazy
[1:52:09] StarShopping95: Encrypted in pugs was just killing the same one every time. Fun in a group where you used all of them.
[1:52:11] UnheardGrace: urh buff + hot hands on enhance, hitting lava lash every global was so fun
[1:52:14] Noxara_: I loved awakened because of the customizability
[1:52:16] MBG_95: Just give us a Season 4 Encrypted season fuck it
[1:52:19] fat_european0: I liked Awakened more. But Encrypted is an affix you can put in any dungeon and it would be great. Awakened would be a bit awkward in some dungs I think
[1:52:24] lucid_wow: encrypted brought all the good stuff awakened did with skips but gave tangible throughput buffs if u didnt actually need the skips it was so sick
[1:52:25] Zingerac: I have such complicated feelings about prideful
[1:52:30] Oracle_WoW: wonder how classic Slands would play out if they allowed Covenant swapping freely from the start.
[1:52:32] RandaIFire: i prefered the dungeons in awakened
[1:52:33] JansonLives: Awakened depends on the dungeon if it allows for cool skips.
[1:52:40] Thickynugnug: urh boon of the ascended priest outdpsing the dps in single target on bosses was a fond memory
[1:52:44] Noxara_: I never got max corruption cause vendor rotation :|
[1:52:46] lucid_wow: im very convinced encrypted haters didnt actually play the season because of how bad s1/s2 slands were
[1:52:47] ItMeMatt: nah the awakened routing was better not just corruption
[1:52:56] Eiya: I love the look Max, you are very beardy
[1:53:05] nellfin: they exist
[1:53:05] kRiZdk: prideful would have been fine if it stopped scaling at a certain keylevel
[1:53:07] RandaIFire: im a sl dungeon hater not an encrypted hater
[1:53:07] misran: there's 2 of them that typed up above
[1:53:08] Aquadriel: encrypt deez
[1:53:18] fat_european0: @RandaIFire  baseg
[1:53:18] greenmachine11235: ecrypted haters are just ppl who shout 'shadowlands was bad' with no logic
[1:53:19] Zingerac: encrpyted was s3 Slands?
[1:53:20] azm07: Asmongold probably ecrypted hater
[1:53:21] caveman2x: encrypted haters are just contrarians looking for attention
[1:53:25] infraredpen: hater is strong, but I'm definitely not an encrypted lover
[1:53:26] StarShopping95: People don't hate it. It's just not that interesting in a pug environment where you kill the same one everytime.
[1:53:26] Veldigodt: its this cata
[1:53:26] laizizzle: its was bad in pugs they just aoe the affix and it was rndm every time cuz they didnt care
[1:53:27] Veldigodt: shit?
[1:53:28] 5murfThis: I didnt love the targetting aspect of it in pugs.
[1:53:35] lucid_wow: @Zingerac YEP
[1:53:37] reggiepowa: I hated it for the first 2 weeks since tanks werent pulling around it but as soon as routes were mostly figured it was a blast
[1:53:41] Imorteus: the game doesnt need apphixes when the dungeons change per season
[1:53:41] Jevv: firstGarf
[1:53:43] infraredpen: @5murfThis same
[1:53:45] Nox1o: @5murfThis most people just yolo aoe, so you needed one prio
[1:53:48] fenitsz: encrypted was not bad but there is no way is better than awakened
[1:53:50] blueheron24: in the possible additions for cata classic i think m+ was being discussed in one the surveys sent around to streamers/players
[1:53:52] pedrean: @Maximum MN state hockey tourney is on where is our costream
[1:53:54] ktthemage: i didn't hate encrypted it was just boring, to me.
[1:53:55] JWallace: I think encrypted is the worst affix ever, but I haven’t played since legion
[1:54:03] Zingerac: @lucid_wow yeah thats a dope season
[1:54:06] Eiya: @pedrean is that the one where they all bleached their hair
[1:54:12] Thickynugnug: the gameplay highs encrypted provided in m+ have yet to be matched imo
[1:54:13] Jumanjiqt: at what expansion do you think the average classic andy hard drops off because they can't do actual mechanics

[2:53:43] Taytor: depends on the soup
[2:53:43] DreadfuryDK: Well, do you eat soup, or do you drink soup?
[2:53:43] lathander557: Max playing BG3 would be the most pog content

[2:54:16] Standy94: ice tea is a soup
[2:54:19] CloudyHS: @Maximum do you consider plastic food
[2:54:21] Ivaed: @herdynawow cause it's like a hot smoothie

[2:55:04] booznoon: max moderates the plastic eating community
[2:55:08] Ivaed: Soup isnt food. It's a drink. Now stew on the other hand... that's food
[2:55:11] Windnecro: people keep throwing big armor theories lmao, but tldr, armor doesnt protect you from headshots so you will take less dam with heavy now but sometimes you still get 1shot with your big helldiver cranium

[3:16:14] DreadfuryDK: gachiBASS
[3:16:18] Goats48: Gayge
[3:16:19] Razdruid: max that BDG guy didn't have a brick he had a fucking log
[3:16:24] VRVento: The only thing that compares is just ignoring one of your players.
[3:16:25] tyraelspirit: what game is that?
[3:16:32] Viisionz74: Anyone got the clip of that asking for a friend
[3:16:37] Razdruid: @Goats48 hey calling it like I saw it man /shrug
[3:16:37] Quiznuhtodd: That would kill the game, professionally.

[3:18:00] Zlynnt: nah the na guys are playing on the eu servers
[3:18:01] Angeels: a lot of NA players went to EU because NA is dead
[3:18:09] nuka73: i PLAY ON NA
[3:18:13] CoffeeASAP: but people on NA that are competitive roll on EU all the time

[3:18:26] iNanners: wait that was a chad bottle open
[3:18:26] theDirtyon3: open a bottle with another bottle baseg
[3:18:26] harrybps: dawg
[3:18:29] DreadfuryDK: Y'all should scoop up Leandros. Bro would increase RWF viewership by at least 6 inches.
[3:18:38] Sherlock_Gecko: mainly EU lol
[3:18:44] Zlynnt: Despairge
[3:18:48] IamBadSry: @iNanners Pog

[3:19:04] Slapsstick: @IamBadSry he ate all his plastic bottle openers
[3:19:06] Mazmerized: VIBES on their team today were not the best
[3:19:08] Therealbrokensword: Nathria vibes
[3:19:10] Schrootpoot: Teapot still stuck and had a bad day today as well
[3:19:13] zannuss: I seen that recently somewhere
[3:19:18] ddepan: what game?
[3:19:19] TeamLiquid: Interested in purchasing a Mythic Amirdrassil, the Dreams Hope boost with Team Liquid? Head over to go.adv.gg/4XuCPI for pricing and to schedule a run! (Gold Only)
[3:19:39] DCBen: its a mental thing
[3:19:40] Angeels: hopefully they kill it soon so our fyrakk prog is less bogged
[3:19:58] Pyrrha_GG: max do you think if blizz moved to 10 man mythic is there still only 2 top guilds or does the talent spread out more you think?
[3:20:05] fleks27: there is always a few hrs of damp after
[3:20:12] fleks27: see raz for you, see sark for us
[3:20:14] fleks27: giga normal
[3:20:18] DreadfuryDK: Fyrakk prog in a nutshell
[3:20:19] armontis2: Do yall gaf about the fated raids if they do it?
[3:20:22] DreadfuryDK: That's how we all do it LOL
[3:20:25] Pdo_13: you can't fake motivation
[3:20:52] CoffeeASAP: honestly it's also because we dont get content like this in gw2 often. The other hard fight like this was released a few years ago
[3:21:15] killerkslr: is dudes chat roasting him?
[3:21:16] DreadfuryDK: Fyrakk's one of those bosses where you either have multiple hours' worth of P1 benders or you have a pull where he just dies. Probably less-so back then because P3 was actually super hard.
[3:21:53] fleks27: dont you just have 2 equal 10 man teams raid 12hrs each
[3:21:56] fleks27: 5Head
[3:22:02] ashara_matsui: So long as the ilvl needed to kill the final boss is far ahead of the ilvl you start at, that will always limit how many people with enough resources for splits can compete
[3:22:34] fleks27: honestly no clue but worth for memes and history
[3:22:46] Schrootpoot: Arenanet decided during this race that they will keep this difficulty and that the nerfed version will be a separate fight. Together with a post by the lead not long ago future is looking bright for GW2 endgame
[3:22:50] Sover31gn: You can slingshot yourself mayb
[3:22:56] Slapsstick: @fleks27 made me think of the old cod days when people take shifts to play with their friends so someone was always playing in the race to prestige master LUL
[3:22:59] DCBen: can that get meta?
[3:23:09] Corncannon1: I used to do shift work and that always happens, night shift never gets shit done
[3:23:11] minikori: thought you already did that
[3:23:11] DreadfuryDK: monkaTOS
[3:23:18] eyeztea: 10man might ruin race but it would be best thing for us casuals
[3:23:25] fleks27: you only play 12 but awake for 16hrs, so you can watch the other team for 4hrs and gain approach
[3:23:25] Docaan: @killerkslr Chat is ruthless LUL
[3:23:30] fleks27: might be a tiny gain
[3:23:32] Jetofficially: im waiting for 10 man
[3:23:53] Shinimatzu: how would they ban u? all the accounts are on the same ip
[3:24:11] minikori: that's just more analysts basically
[3:24:14] kravmagaga: if it switched to 10, if anything i'd guess people who don't get play would split off and be at a disadvantage on a new team
[3:24:24] nuka73: @Maximum  that game is  very simple there no gear farm you just leggos and that is
[3:24:46] ayadas: Maevey's a beast
[3:24:49] wonkus1: lmao
[3:24:50] Faraday5001: nah meavey just built diff
[3:24:54] MooHamOinkBeef: Maevy just built diff
[3:25:06] Docaan: Or just on drugs
[3:25:06] Noobysauce: maevey doesnt eat plastic thats why he can do 24 hours
[3:25:07] Slapsstick: sleep M+
[3:25:08] MooHamOinkBeef: That's my Augfficer
[3:25:11] Ztormurr: i think that more guilds would be in the competition for the top seats
[3:25:12] Corncannon1: wear masks
[3:25:15] reymargera: no way some people can account share with the keybinds some of these people have
[3:25:16] Variekz: Maevy Vamprire confirmed
