[5:34:36] Luxthos: FailFish
[5:34:38] indiegarona: @MightyMouse019 congrats on your followage, but you raised the topic, Towelliee answered you, subject over. Stop trolling.
[5:34:40] pigzip: Did we find out why his power went out ?

[5:35:04] Anguyen92ab: All right, then what's the issue?
[5:35:20] indiegarona: It's enough @MightyMouse019 - you're beating a dead horse.
[5:35:26] keepcalmchris: basically
[5:35:29] indiegarona: You expressed your opinion, it was noted.
[5:35:32] indiegarona: Move on
[5:35:40] Luxthos: @MightyMouse019 There's probably no point in bringing it up or stirring the subject it's usually a bait topic that leads nowhere, hence why people are probably asking you don't push it.

[5:36:44] Gappopo: If you want cheaper play Alliance LUL
[5:36:44] Anguyen92ab: @mmrghost7 The beauty part of me making gold at the rate I am at, is that I don't really focus on the number to spend on flasks and other stuff.
