[2:18:31] bravoq_q: 5% in st 2-4% aoe
[2:18:32] slappygilmore_: ferals buff is actually pretty big
[2:18:33] Repsie: Simulation suggests a ~5.2% buff to single-target in the pure ST build / on the BiS profile. Assuming no talent changes, ~4.9% buff to ST in BiS profile in a typical M+ build.

[2:20:42] zerossussy: outlaw is king probably
[2:20:44] z1llen: @katsoudasp if you check the ladder of played classes you will see that shadow is like the least played class out of all dps classes even worse than ww monk
[2:20:49] cvitee: shaman and priest are gonna be nice
[2:20:49] orangutan345: or realising the BLP Leggo system was shite and they have to compensate with buffs
[2:20:58] z1llen: @katsoudasp and thats just straight facts
[2:21:00] DoubleProGG: @cvitee since they announced the new class balancing i see 4/6 times shadows playing  :D
[2:21:03] Prycey: considering how many times they've had to buff the lego and now they needed to buff the 2h str classes is kind of a joke tbh

[2:27:13] orangutan345: Is it true you had a hand in Lørgok joining Method in order to become the swolest guy in Echo?
[2:27:21] plejka123: Would you say Kuznam is kinda reason Echo exists today as it is? If It wasn't from him Serenity wouldn't exist and then Scripe wouldnt merge with Method which after lead to Echo.so could we say Kuznam is reason Echo exists today as it is haha

[2:37:02] emperorkittens: god that was so fun
[2:37:04] Kayvonnn: BFA season 2 was pretty fun
[2:37:05] Kaathey: encrypted was the best affix ever
[2:37:06] TiPera: that affix was so much fun
[2:37:08] TiPera: imo
[2:37:12] samathi21: i liked s4 bfa the most
[2:37:12] zerossussy: tormented wasn't too bad
[2:37:13] miraagex: sl s2
[2:37:13] bowlpad: enctrypted op tho, but more kiss/curse affix would be amazing
[2:37:17] yohananya: awakened was bis
[2:37:18] Cyberkaia_: pride was fun too
[2:37:22] zerossussy: thundering was cursed
[2:37:26] keithlockn: no

[2:37:42] Prycey: the stun on thundering was a pain in the ass
[2:37:48] keithlockn: oh then yeah
[2:37:51] sparkdinho: i miss prideful
[2:37:58] emperorkittens: thundering also sucked with other affixes on its own may not as bad
[2:37:59] Neyebae: Thundering was so bad whenever something else overlapped with it
[2:38:04] Trox2099: Bfa revenant was ae fun
[2:38:06] Delias__: Yeah prideful was so fun
[2:38:09] Pava_TV: m+ is so outdated in my opinion, we need new affixes, imagine we still have to deal with bolstering, worst affix ever created
[2:38:15] TiPera: prideful was fun but on high keys was not good, people rather skip it to not waste cds on it than play it
[2:38:20] kwlski01: thundering overlaps + clearing with tank frontal KEKW
[2:38:24] keithlockn: remove bolstering and bursting
[2:38:25] bowlpad: can we also remove affixes  that forces u to use uility or dispells etc on them instead of the mobs we are currently dealing with
[2:38:26] timmytothic: well i got a fucking ad
[2:38:28] conebabz: The thing is that afflicted is to much with bosses like 3rd boss in Tides.. I mean u have to dispell ppl, and the tank gets clapped on totem.. Also dispells on 2nd boss in Fall..
[2:38:31] sycho_shotz_: sanguine bolstering
[2:38:32] zerossussy: KEKW
[2:38:33] Neyebae: TRUE
[2:38:35] tacomagex: blizz doesnt play their own game
[2:38:36] f9ftw: lol yaaaaah
[2:38:37] xli89: sanguine
[2:38:37] Cyberkaia_: encruypted was taht.. if u fuckup y get speed mov KEKW.
[2:38:39] xli89: complete
[2:38:40] zerossussy: everbloom bolstering is absolutely illegal
[2:38:40] Wiikz: most seasonal affixes has been great, problem is blizzard having to make it kiss/curse
[2:38:41] xli89: shit
[2:38:44] Onko22: They do sanguine / bursting too
[2:38:46] troxleer: fortified and bolstering is so pain LUL
[2:38:48] Hekistylz: on death affixes imNOTcrying
[2:38:51] Kaathey: @GingiTV do blizzard ever ask about high rated players opinion for some changes?
[2:38:51] vombas: incorporeal is ass
[2:38:53] JiminyCracker: Dont forget raging @GingiTV
[2:38:53] zerossussy: lots of asses
[2:38:54] Jasbie: everbloom is the most ass dungeon with so many affixes
[2:38:54] conebabz: They could put it down to 50 and 100% or just one add
[2:38:54] Prycey: I'd like Awakened to come back
[2:38:56] Prime_Rage: awakened was great, route creativaty was awesome
[2:38:56] Fuzzy_17: bolstering
[2:38:59] truthlol: afflicted is really toxic
[2:39:01] conebabz: incorperal is easy
[2:39:04] Ontarin92: its actually unreal that they havent added dreadpedals as an exception with affixes
[2:39:07] sycho_shotz_: they add so much time to keys that have tight timers makes them non completable
[2:39:11] cyn_x: every affix is either ass or zero-impact, good game
[2:39:13] Neyebae: But the fact that you need dwarf for an affix is not cool
[2:39:29] alex10lemke: can u explain how sub rogues are doing so much burst dmg?
[2:39:33] zerossussy: non punishing seasonal affixes, best option
[2:39:38] zerossussy: thats literally what haunted everyone
[2:39:46] sycho_shotz_: the fact that you need aug 2 seasons in a row is ass
[2:39:46] zerossussy: g'huun affix was incredibly bad
[2:39:48] noshiximana: +1 xD
[2:39:48] fremen14: bro
[2:39:51] Neyebae: It was not fun
[2:39:51] z1llen: Me

[2:39:53] fremen14: getting oneshot by 1 melee
[2:39:57] kwlski01: me YEP
[2:39:59] TopicxTV: @cyn_x Affixes are stupid. Should just be Fortified and Tyrannical alternate and thats it. That way every week is a push week. So much more fun.
[2:40:00] Neyebae: And they had longer arms than they do now too
[2:40:02] BenvyTV: me
[2:40:04] symbolicben: why arent you in the raid gingi?
[2:40:05] conebabz: Yes sir.. it just smelled u and u were dead
[2:40:06] Delias__: God that thing kept spawing on me and one shoting me
[2:40:07] sycho_shotz_: they would spawn on you and one shot you
[2:40:09] nomi91: yeah that was pretty bad these times ^^
[2:40:10] bowlpad: some of them has a massive melee ranged aswell so ur moving out and it still claps u
[2:40:11] gambleragain: How do you avoid one shots from Juggernauts? Or Abomination group one shots with bolstering? Can't be outplayed it's dumb.
[2:40:12] zerossussy: double zul on teeming in king's rest which lasted few days KEKW do u remember KEKW
[2:40:17] cakeslolz: anyone miss the mist of tyrn with spiteful?
[2:40:27] timmytothic: @GingiTV  did you see my question did you like season 4 shadowlands
[2:40:30] Pava_TV: remember beguiling or w/e it was the name, Azshara one.. where u had to use full CDs to kill mob
[2:40:30] laetuss: bolstering also increasing mob health was a vibe
[2:40:35] mangotangodown66: what do you think about adding more affixes that give buffs if play it right?
[2:40:41] ryan280_: I like affixes that can be positive and negative
[2:40:42] Echo_Esports: Gear up for raid with a world-class sitting experience. Enjoy the same long-lasting comfort as Echo, only with the Secretlab TITAN Evo gaming chair: echogg.ly/secretlab/Gingi
[2:40:44] vombas: next week sanguine Despairge
[2:40:46] Erry_tv: sanguine is still a pain in the ass , bolster is okay now but still too strong, the rest is okay
[2:40:54] itsdatwoowoo: i thought encrypted was great.  it scaled a little bit too much, but it was great.
[2:40:56] Happyhedgehogz: what affixes next week?
[2:40:57] nvnto: why would they add a positive affix? that would be fun Kappa
[2:40:59] Kaathey: or bolstering staying infinite amount of time, the 17m seagul in eye of azshara
[2:41:00] zerossussy: legion skittish Despairge
[2:41:01] sycho_shotz_: next week is sanguine incorp
[2:41:03] turfjitsu: i like hearing people complain about affixes and still be barely +20 gamers
[2:41:06] d4kuuuuu: as a warrior main i hate affixes
[2:41:08] ryan280_: Affixes that show skill expression are the best
[2:41:11] Dawsteur: Hey @GingiTV, what would you think of a Season 4 with litterally no affixes? Like, just try keys freely with only the kicks, mechanics, etc. and let's see how high teams can go!
[2:41:23] Pava_TV: @zerossussy I forgot about that lmao
[2:41:47] symbolicben: do u think m+ would be more fun if we had no affixes? or only like good fixes ?
[2:41:49] gambleragain: I miss that first season Shadowlands 4th affix.
[2:41:50] zerossussy: worst seasonal affix was g'huun and thundering
[2:42:04] vombas: Afflicted is horrible when playing specs without dispell, just looking at the sht going through without being able to stop it
[2:42:24] TopicxTV: You could make an argument to scrap affixes all together. Mythic+ system is already designed to scale and get harder with key level. There are enough mechanics to worry about.
[2:42:27] sycho_shotz_: 1st boss is free last 3 are way overtuned
[2:42:29] troxleer: @GingiTV do you remember the affix in legion Overflowing? KEKW
[2:42:31] gambleragain: Bring Prideful back.
[2:42:34] conebabz: 1 boss is too easy, and last bosses is overtuned imo
[2:42:35] TopicxTV: Gamers would love if every week was a push week..
[2:42:42] Ontarin92: dont bring prideful back prideful was ass
[2:42:44] reggiepowa: who is that new echo player who died right on pull
[2:42:48] zerossussy: overflowing bfa
[2:42:49] zerossussy: no?
[2:42:50] Kaathey: @TopicxTV why is that a bad thing tho ?
[2:42:52] cakeslolz: it did
[2:42:52] zerossussy: dont remember
[2:42:59] sycho_shotz_: my key is 29 everbloom no shot it will get completed XD
[2:43:02] cakeslolz: it was over healing
[2:43:03] Prycey: I loved awaekened
[2:43:07] FriendCat: overflow was cringe
[2:43:09] Ontarin92: skittish was good SeemsGood
[2:43:11] Ontarin92: tank aggro
[2:43:12] zerossussy: wasn't overflowing bfa
[2:43:15] TopicxTV: @Kaathey You misunderstood me. I'm saying no affixes would be awesome. Every week you could push. Tuning would be easier.
[2:43:20] Wiikz: blizzard def remove seasonal affixes for less work
[2:43:20] miraagex: kek
[2:43:20] zerossussy: pre nerf skittish was illegal LOL
[2:43:21] sawako07: I REMEMBER TEEMING Kaooa
[2:43:22] miraagex: no blink
[2:43:25] conebabz: Wrong talents :D
[2:43:27] cakeslolz: @gingitv it was over healing absorb
[2:43:29] ole94_: shimmer gaming
[2:43:31] Kaathey: @TopicxTV oh yeah i misunderstood. would be awesome indeed
[2:43:31] zerossussy: pre nerf skittish wasn't enough with triple tricks
[2:43:31] reggiepowa: gingi not getting benched on prog yet EZ
[2:43:37] DoubleProGG: i liked in bfa where u get every certain % an over run of deadge mops :D
[2:43:41] Cyberkaia_: EB sux tbh, 1st boss its a meme, then u have to deal with death between untunned bosses and berserker or wasps
[2:44:01] LuLuXx: bongoTAP
[2:44:06] huggmejsel: huggmejsel subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 6 months, currently on a 1 month streak! 
[2:44:31] itsdatwoowoo: i think everbloom is the most fun key this season.  highest skill cap, but large number of adds and control.
[2:44:38] gambleragain: ABOM BOOM
[2:44:39] WolfSuzume: ToT spear throwers Despairge
[2:44:41] Pava_TV: everyone likes when berserker gets 5 bolstering stakcs and just 1 shot you
[2:44:43] TSmarine: blossoms def shouldn't be attached to affixes like bursting or bolstering
[2:44:45] sycho_shotz_: weeks like this week sucks you have to have two dispellers other than healer so healer can dispell things that need dispelled
[2:44:46] logdrop69: do i want to have stacking namesplates box checked on plater?
[2:44:46] Pava_TV: my fav feeling
[2:44:46] conebabz: Pre move yes, or just stun before they jump..
[2:44:47] Cyberkaia_: just time a 25  EB.. DH tank carry hard on those pulls
[2:44:52] Kaathey: Also while they're at it they should look into giving more rewards for playing m+ like PVP. cool wep enchants or smth wild
[2:45:10] conebabz: 3rd boss in tides is ass
[2:45:14] conebabz: with afflicted
[2:45:20] Dawsteur: 2nd boss of Fall
[2:45:21] Shandrail: 2nd boss of fall
[2:45:22] sycho_shotz_: 2nd boss is fall
[2:45:28] itsdatwoowoo: 2nd boss in fall
[2:45:29] Delias__: Or in Fall after first boss, with afflicted it's just not fun
[2:45:30] Henneng: How does the trial work in Echo? Is it forgiving that they are new and nervous (as in playing slightly worse during trial), or is it a part of the trial to see if they work well under pressure?
[2:45:31] gambleragain: @GingiTV Throne of Tide flame shock.
[2:45:32] Krazay: totem boss of throne
[2:45:48] symbolicben: aug can dispell 2 times
[2:45:50] symbolicben: technically
[2:45:53] sycho_shotz_: every 1 min
[2:45:53] symbolicben: so 5 dispells
[2:45:58] conebabz: Yeah thats 3rd boss.. thats super ass
[2:45:59] itsdatwoowoo: yeah.  everbloom trash and rise trash with afflicted is pretty terrible
[2:46:00] kawakhshami: @GingiTV will aug evokers play a big roll in mdi ?
[2:46:05] sycho_shotz_: caut flame is so busted bro so good
[2:46:07] Erry_tv: i'm maining shaman, afflicted week is the only week i feel usefull :s
[2:46:13] druggie12: who rating trials on echo ?
[2:46:16] druggie12: or depend on class
[2:46:16] sycho_shotz_: i doubt aug will be in mdi
[2:46:18] thomasasboe: Why are you not raiding? :)
[2:46:27] sycho_shotz_: they will play 3 classes that rip ass
[2:46:28] Echo_Esports: Save up to 35% and level up your stream with Elgato! Get started today : echogg.ly/elgato/Gingi
[2:46:30] symbolicben: the amount of time caut flames saves me or even a teammate of mine is insane
[2:46:41] gambleragain: As disc, i try to time radiance on afflicted spawn.
[2:46:42] symbolicben: same with renewing blaze
[2:46:45] conebabz: tank gets busted on totem, and u have to dispel every 7 sec.. its way to much with afflicted
[2:46:59] TSmarine: !song
[2:47:05] truthlol: ye
[2:47:07] ScottTridge: It's probably so he can Belor'relos and shimmer in
[2:47:08] itsdatwoowoo: he said he was "trying it out"
[2:47:16] symbolicben: gingi do u think anyone aug would be played in the mdi by any teams ?
[2:47:17] Cyberkaia_: yeah but u ar talking 25+ keys on that comp, like 1% of the population. 3200io  = 1% of population. so basicly this week was a pain in the ass for a 99% KEKW
[2:47:22] glowdive: as a healer i just skip this week ngl. pugging can be so toxic its not worth sometimes lool
[2:47:24] cakeslolz: @gingitv you can run the barrier talent to
[2:47:26] ace50: Hopeful fault 2 ppl died Kappa
[2:47:29] tahkken: Arcane on tswift?? Why no frost pad? Lol
[2:47:45] majkos: My tinfoil theory is that blizz detest m+ for how successful it became, they wanted new system for legion to scrap it after and then they got stuck. Thats why they didnt really do anything big with it since
[2:47:58] sycho_shotz_: is anyone doing fyrakk mount sells yet
[2:48:12] truthlol: hopeful hates frost you have to make him play  it somehow
[2:48:19] fibbopaladinos: @majkos bad take
[2:48:35] gambitenjoyer: so fuckin true
[2:48:49] Cyberkaia_: true
[2:48:49] Ontarin92: what else is there to do in this game except m+?
[2:48:54] derFROQ: pet-battles? Kappa
[2:48:55] Dipnoy: What if they reworked affixes to be the same but they all had a positive side
[2:48:56] TiPera: good point
[2:48:58] majkos: @fibbopaladinos so true fr fr no cap
[2:48:58] MistEmpire: @glowdive Sounds like a skill issue
[2:49:05] ParfumAmerican: when is MDI ?
[2:49:29] itsdatwoowoo: i wish they made it so you could be a m+ only player.  needing raid trinkets is ass
[2:49:32] Cyberkaia_: @ParfumAmerican Feb, jan 30 start the tryouts
[2:49:40] Tylarr_: Touching the mic WutFace
[2:49:54] mutten93: @gingitv is there going to be another MDI in DF?
[2:50:06] Ontarin92: yes
[2:50:06] cakeslolz: you don’t need raid trinkets but they are better
[2:50:18] Ahram: no
[2:50:20] emperorkittens: i would enjoy it better yes
[2:50:20] hogbruhh: Actually yes
[2:50:22] WolfSuzume: naaaa
[2:50:23] imbatree: hell no
[2:50:23] AverageChameleon: no
[2:50:24] cakeslolz: no
[2:50:24] Delias__: Nah that would be ass
[2:50:24] TheRatPresident: no
[2:50:25] noshiximana: nop
[2:50:25] Ontarin92: it would kill raiding
[2:50:26] gambitenjoyer: I mean theres people like Skylarked for instance who plays 29s and hasn't ran any mythic. Do you really need raid? if someone like him is only playing heroic + M+?
[2:50:26] ghawul: no
[2:50:27] noshiximana: more balance
[2:50:28] TheRatPresident: that would be horrible
[2:50:28] d4_damager_: yeah youd get to farm more gear overall
[2:50:28] Dipnoy: Nope
[2:50:36] emperorkittens: finding 19 other people to do raid just so i can get trinkets is crazy
[2:50:38] Delias__: I mean why raid then
[2:50:43] Ahram: I dont want to have 3 diffrent gear sets for playing my character
[2:50:44] noshiximana: they will need to tune more
[2:50:48] TahviTV: Ever since they completely split up pvp and pve gear ive stopped pvping since I dont have the time to gear both.
[2:50:51] kwlski01: would like it, hate raiding
[2:50:59] cakeslolz: m+ and raid complement each other
[2:50:59] Ontarin92: why force ppl in raid tho pvp'ers dont have to why should we
[2:51:04] Wiikz: make raid 10 man 20 is cancer
[2:51:05] Cyberkaia_: @lirklol TBH raid on m+ its more on min maxing side, its not mandatory
[2:51:06] zini7: on casual level its fun as it is, on alts Im using m+/pvp/raid gear mix
[2:51:08] TheRatPresident: @TahviTV getting full pvp gear takes literally half a day
[2:51:20] conebabz: Not at all, but i do belive they put a lot of the good gear into raid.. Im guessing its because u cant really grind that gear like u can from m+
[2:51:22] itsdatwoowoo: i agree they "want you to".  but you cant get 489 raid trinkets.  you can at least get a chance at 489 m+ trinkets
[2:51:41] zini7: @TheRatPresident as a healer
[2:51:42] imbatree: m+ playercount would drop drastically if you wouldnt get good items for raid
[2:51:51] d4_damager_: problem with needing raid gear for m+ is it limits the guilds you can be in
[2:51:58] kwlski01: gearing only m+ seems to take a really long time compared to raiding
[2:52:00] gambitenjoyer: @Cyberkaia_ Thats my whole point. Everyone can just pug heroic raid even with M+ gear. the 483 vs 489 trinket is irrelevant, literally look at some of the top M+ers. gear is different but trinket 483 vs 489 is nothing. no i get heroic is still a "raid" but u can just pug it. you dont need to join guild etc, technically only doing "M+" so i dont get this guys point since u can do that rn
[2:52:08] Echo_Esports: Celebrate Echo's latest win in the RWF with the New World First mousepad and loads of other great merch at echogg.ly/merch/Gingi
[2:52:20] Ontarin92: no it wouldnt thats Kapp
[2:52:31] imbatree: its both pve, no need to seperation
[2:52:34] rains_wl: bring back reforging to balance stats easier ngl
[2:52:34] Moobot: A few spots have opened up for my Winter Fitness Program. Read more here https://bit.ly/4aVJKsn if you'd like to get in shape before summer! 😎
[2:52:43] Delias__: It's stil a MMO i mean you need to do content to get better gear it's logic
[2:52:48] cakeslolz: is raid gear really going to make some random twitch chatter time a key that isn’t wf?
[2:52:54] Wiikz: yes its both pve but one requires 5 players the other requires 20 players
[2:52:57] Cyberkaia_: @imbatree both have a huger difference on playstyle
[2:53:04] miiloswow: ive gotten 1 avoidance peice this entire season
[2:53:06] miiloswow: lmao
[2:53:14] Ontarin92: if raid drops something like gavel or cheat death trinkets maybe yes @cakeslolz
[2:53:18] imbatree: i would even go a step further and say bring back good pvp trinkets for pve like in Shadowlands
[2:53:19] hogbruhh: thats only for whales tho or boosters xd
[2:53:31] Paxonator: Should just be able to buy it with vault tokens
[2:53:35] HolyQ: they should add it as enchant like socket sold for coins from vault
[2:53:40] druggie12: last season i payed 40m for full mythci boost
[2:53:54] druggie12: i thin k4m is so good price for 4 leach items
[2:54:02] hogbruhh: @Paxonator actually a good change, vault token to add a tertiary stat
[2:54:03] lysekross: yeah i've said that you should get m+ solo que
[2:54:08] itsbrand_: imo fated tokens should be a thing to combat gear chasing
[2:54:08] thenateo2: how can u do solo q when there are meta specs and non meta specs @GingiTV
[2:54:15] thenateo2: people will leave if they see non meta
[2:54:16] itsmiraix: like, official rio ingame display
[2:54:25] itsmiraix: but queing is a hard thing
[2:54:26] mursimiz: im maining feral
[2:54:28] mursimiz: so that change
[2:54:31] mursimiz: would own
[2:54:31] itsmiraix: because its so comb based
[2:54:32] kwlski01: yea a queue system basically, it would be nice, people would complain about dps queue times doh KEKW
[2:54:37] nefimee: the bad thing about m+ is to wait 30min for a key for it to be depleted during first pull and everyone leaving soloq ould be nice
[2:54:41] cakeslolz: a boss rush mode that scales like m+ but not like torgast
[2:54:45] imbatree: with solo que m+ they have to add a Trustpilot feature
[2:54:51] imbatree: so you can give 1 star to leavers
[2:54:54] imbatree: with proof only
[2:54:58] crowel: I wouldn't mind solo queue M+ to a certain level.  So people could catch up in raider io a bit if they fall behind in a season
[2:55:02] WolfSuzume: problem with solo que will be the same as pvp one with nobody will play healer probably peepoShrug
[2:55:10] sycho_shotz_: it would be almost impossible with all the affixes to do a solo queue
[2:55:12] deathwysh: brez/lust/being able to deal with affixes. how would you make that work though
[2:55:15] itsmiraix: minus raiting
[2:55:21] deathwysh: @sycho_shotz_ my thoughts exactly
[2:55:22] hogbruhh: leave = -20k gold Kappa
[2:55:24] nidosarg: time banned?
[2:55:26] Ontarin92: a forfeit key vote
[2:55:29] hothotboxthecar: it would have to be like a vote to end key thing
[2:55:36] Ontarin92: /ff
[2:55:37] Cyberkaia_: like in LOL u can vote
[2:55:38] Ontarin92: yeh
[2:55:38] Wiikz: yup
[2:55:38] TFTCurse: yes
[2:55:39] Shandrail: delete an equiped item :D
[2:55:40] emperorkittens: yep
[2:55:40] cakeslolz: I like to leave keys, please don’t punish me
[2:55:41] Cyberkaia_: yep
[2:55:42] thenateo2: imagine you queue up for a solo q key and your group doesnt have res or lust KEKW
[2:55:42] smokey__uk: a karma rating
[2:55:46] Shandrail: leave = legy delete xd
[2:55:53] softtake: ye but if I GET HOSATAGED IN WOW I KMS
[2:55:55] azzzhrar: Yeah but then people can hold hostage in disgusting 50 death keys
[2:56:00] rains_wl: give all tanks lust all healers rez gg
[2:56:01] Ontarin92: monkaw
[2:56:02] rains_wl: for solo que
[2:56:03] itsdatwoowoo: i wonder if they normalized brez / lust where the "party" got it if that would make it better as well.  otherwise you need a specific comp again
[2:56:10] sycho_shotz_: they should just do a 3 yes
[2:56:14] Cyberkaia_: LOL leavers have a penalty but party can vote to surrender
[2:56:18] Rogastik: you only need 4/5 to surrender though
[2:56:21] Ontarin92: its 4/5 votes required to leave
[2:56:27] beamishhhhh: 4/5 YET
[2:56:30] beamishhhhh: Yeah**
[2:56:32] imbatree: "Your deathcounter rose above X - you can leave the key with no penalty"
[2:56:33] cakeslolz: I should be able to leave after 5 deaths change my mind
[2:56:35] rains_wl: or like CS if you leave too much you get low prio quue
[2:56:46] smokey__uk: thats a lot of bans then LUL
[2:56:50] Delias__: I really don't think Blizzard want to take this route with the game, we are getting too far away from their MMO idea
[2:56:51] Jokinje: If timer runs out you should be able to leave no penalty, 4/5 votes to disband prior to timer. Report for griefing
[2:56:53] da_fish_21: doing that you’ll get people who vote to kick as a joke
[2:56:53] Rogastik: @cakeslolz most falls are timed with more even on a 30 lol
[2:56:59] throne_arc: @GingiTV you watching how hopeful plays?
[2:57:00] orangutan345: The leaver should be replaced by an NPC.. true purpose of the follower dungeon Kappa
[2:57:04] softtake: If 4/5 votes i literally kill myself cuz theres always minimum 2 deluded guys
[2:57:08] Wiikz: they will most likely stop
[2:57:09] cakeslolz: @rogastik I’m trolling
[2:57:13] smokey__uk: yeah a deterrent
[2:57:18] Hugejorma: Toxic only forced to play with other toxic players LUL
[2:57:21] gary9496: The leaver should be replaced by an NPC.. true purpose of the follower dungeon Kappa
[2:57:22] noshiximana: well people play lol and they still grief xd
[2:57:31] Shandrail: i still don't know why warris don't get a bl.. i mean we shout to boost the moral, wouldn't that be a good reason for the warrior design
[2:57:37] gulliblelion: might be annoying if a key is timeable and your team votes to quit
[2:57:51] smokey__uk: LUL
[2:57:51] imbatree: they could add a savior queue slot where you get queued in groups where someoneleft only and get bonus rewards
[2:57:54] kwlski01: EZ
[2:57:55] azzzhrar: +30 with npc xd
[2:57:56] Ontarin92: yeah add an aug NPC
[2:57:57] ace50: @gulliblelion pug world... 1 wipe = "gg"
[2:58:06] smokey__uk: a gamer npc
[2:58:07] Araxiwow: really bad
[2:58:09] kingpeace09: trash
[2:58:10] Ontarin92: they're gamers
[2:58:10] fatality_dota: Nah we´re good . if you want to play M+ , just get your boys . problem solved
[2:58:10] Delias__: They just spam 1 button KEKL
[2:58:11] TorzzyW: 3/10
[2:58:11] Raitox92: Terrible
[2:58:12] Jopsi: They pulled everything
[2:58:12] LinkmizteR: they are reallly bad
[2:58:12] ntrihard5: theyre smurfing no cap on god fr fr
[2:58:14] nefimee: i played with the npcs and they are better than someplayer LUL
[2:58:14] EverisTV: my tank started running back and forth in the first 10 seconds of the dungeon
[2:58:16] itsdatwoowoo: hahaha.  they are hilarious.  mage has AOE res
[2:58:16] gulliblelion: @ace50 Sadge
[2:58:17] CGd0c: MDI pulls
[2:58:18] truthlol: they are gamers go and do one rn
[2:58:23] Tylarr_: Island Expedition npcs PEpega
[2:58:25] 3V3R357: maybe those NPCs eventually get so giga OP that you play MDI finals vs them
[2:58:25] Tylarr_: Pepega
[2:58:30] Zoi888: They don't die to swirlies on everbloom
[2:58:31] sardow90: they are the average chatter
[2:58:40] Zoi888: 🤣
[2:58:41] cakeslolz: @gingitv the NPCs warn you about mechanics coming up
[2:58:45] Ontarin92: just make an aug npc that spams ebon might and prescience
[2:58:51] Zoi888: They were awful, little bit better with update
[2:58:53] itsdatwoowoo: this is my favorite stream of yours btw.  love the chatting and analyzing on the side!
[2:58:54] TorzzyW: they cant do uldaman vikings
[2:58:57] orangutan345: Lemmings
[2:58:58] Raitox92: Its only normal dungeons, you cant die
[2:59:03] Cypfer: Pull counter chat?
[2:59:04] Wiikz: no way blizzard programs something like that with their spaghetti code
[2:59:04] d4_damager_: the bots play like wow devs
[2:59:05] Rogastik: they stand in some stuff, I saw Max do one and bm hunter stood in every tank frontal in algathar
[2:59:07] LinkmizteR: you know what, they should honestly implementy AI into those and in time they will be come M+ gods
[2:59:09] soraztwitch: Go try it :P
[2:59:09] fatality_dota: Well I tried playing with them , pulled a bit too many and we got wiped
[2:59:09] orangutan345: They die and insta rez
[2:59:10] moro864: they just wipe if you leave them alone
[2:59:13] Shandrail: they use at least bl xd
[2:59:15] starcraft_t_v: can you run a follower dungeon?
[2:59:19] starcraft_t_v: for science
[2:59:27] glowdive: echo vs AI MDI championship
[2:59:35] Raitox92: @Shandrail I did one run and they used BL at 10% boss hp XD
[2:59:37] miiloswow: @Rogastik  sounds like it was programmed well Kappa
[2:59:37] cakeslolz: @gingitv what if someone leaves and a boy auto fills for you
[2:59:38] motymcrdbl: my healer died from the green puddle before the tree boss in algeth'ar, seems about right
[2:59:39] sycho_shotz_: is anyone selling fyrakk mounts yet ?
[2:59:40] Ironhide433: Imagine as punishment a full world tour with follower dungeon as healer
[2:59:42] cakeslolz: bot
[2:59:57] rains_wl: how well do you think you'd do echo vs top programmed AI group in head to head mdi lol
[2:59:58] sawako07: wLOOKING GOOD TODAY @GingiTV
[3:00:05] thenateo2: Where are fyrakk nerfs, that boss is gonna have 1k guilds on it
[3:00:06] imbatree: They could make random affixes with solo queue m+
[3:00:07] thenateo2: KEKW
[3:00:11] imbatree: with certain filters to prevent ass
[3:00:12] Shandrail: @Raitox92 xD same for me but it was like 25% while the boss didn't had any mechanic that could put u in any danger xd
[3:00:18] majkos: Do you think 4-man or 6-man m+ could work?
[3:00:19] Valredyl: They probl nerf when HOF is closed
[3:00:23] smokey__uk: is it on 100 kills yet ?
[3:00:33] Ontarin92: i'd rather see 10 man raid
[3:00:36] sycho_shotz_: this boss having a mount, pet for hunters and a druid form is actually insane and will be a gold mine through season 4
[3:00:36] azzzhrar: I think its on 151
[3:00:37] konkylie34: how many is hall of fame?
[3:00:38] Rogastik: @sm0key_uk its like 140-150 atm
[3:00:40] thenateo2: @sm0key_uk 150
[3:00:47] smokey__uk: kk ty
[3:00:50] d4_damager_: add support role make more support classes
[3:00:55] zerossussy: 10 man raiding is insane
[3:01:01] itsmiraix: So a bit like the old Fireland days?
[3:01:02] Shandrail: 10 man 20 man and 40 man
[3:01:03] bleedr_: Kappa
[3:01:04] zerossussy: everyone wants it except blizzard
[3:01:05] sawako07: have 1/1/1/3 with a support class
[3:01:09] Delias__: Yeah for small guild would be perfect
[3:01:14] Avengedhonor: so echo can brench gingi lol
[3:01:16] r0bin10: Would you get same itlvl?
[3:01:17] Raitox92: 10 man mythic would be super popular, but be hard to balance and spark a discussion again
[3:01:20] cakeslolz: @gingitv how come no 6th man shot caller for high m+ yet?
[3:01:21] zerossussy: 40 is outdated for sure
[3:01:23] Rogastik: 40man would be 0 fps, engine cant handle it
[3:01:24] sycho_shotz_: this boss having a mount, pet for hunters and a druid form is actually insane and will be a gold mine through season 4
[3:01:25] thenateo2: 40 man fyrakk with seeds OMEGALUL
[3:01:27] Shandrail: but gives more loot :(
[3:01:34] wackiz: What do you think about Max take that having 10 and 20 man Mythic wud make the quality of the Raids drop?
[3:01:35] Paxonator: 40man.... im lagging out on tindral with 20atm cant imagine 40
[3:01:37] wsinno: back to 25m
[3:02:03] Ontarin92: dont ever say that word again
[3:02:05] majkos: 40 man LAG, yeah sign me ine
[3:02:12] sawako07: maw Despairge
[3:02:13] Echo_Esports: Grab your fantastic new Displates for up to 33% off! Use echogg.ly/displate/Gingi and enter code: ECHO
[3:02:16] Aro725: The Maw???? monkaS
[3:02:21] ReyAnes: 10 man m+
[3:02:23] cakeslolz: 40 man content can’t be as punishing as 20
[3:02:43] gsega: gsega subscribed with Prime. 
[3:02:50] zerossussy: 10 man world first might be something annoying?
[3:03:00] hakubibubi: when do they enable Cross Realm Mythic raiding again?
[3:03:05] wsinno: theres way too many class/specs for 10m mythic, alot of those specs will get prem bench.
[3:03:05] erlenddddddd: Would be nice with some 10 man raids though, where you cant be more than 10
[3:03:10] cakeslolz: what about mythic flex raiding
[3:03:19] Wiikz: I dont think it would do that much, since hc is already flexible
[3:03:23] zerossussy: 10 man raiding after hall of fame closed might be something ideal?
[3:03:28] Aro725: Mythic flex would be really cool But i think very hard to tune
[3:03:29] Shandrail: what about raids like zul aman that can only be raided as 10 man?
[3:03:38] Rogastik: How do they tune it though, either 10 or 20 will always be easier, we saw this issue before when 10 and 25 existed. 10man alakir was a joke compared to 25man.
[3:03:38] gsega: UI
[3:03:49] gsega: !ui
[3:03:50] Moobot: @gsega UI for Season 3 is now available! WA's for all specs, new trinkets, dungeons & raids. All Subscribers can now download it on my discord at: https://discord.gg/JZDJUAZ
[3:03:57] Delias__: Would be super nice
[3:04:02] Aro725: Pausechamp
[3:04:06] mainblanc: Bror du har ramt den
[3:04:09] zerossussy: 10 man opens after HoF closes?
[3:04:15] mircescu95: hey gingi ?
[3:04:16] EverisTV: yep i wish we had 10 man mythic, just want to raid with the homies
[3:04:18] Ironhide433: Let him cook
[3:04:23] Rogastik: Why not make it flex at that point not 10 man ?
[3:04:25] mircescu95: are raid weak auras available for people ?
[3:04:32] xPriamx: but then make the hall 100 and not 200 pls
[3:04:32] Shandrail: in 10 man i can go nonverbal mode
[3:04:42] sycho_shotz_: farm heroic till HOF lets gooooo
[3:04:43] Delias__: Yeah i just want to blast mythic with my small guildies, don't want to add pug to it everytime
[3:04:43] cakeslolz: @gingitv there really isn’t that many guilds getting to farm
[3:04:54] mircescu95: @gingi are raid weak aura available for evrey1 ? or are they just secret still ?
[3:04:56] 3V3R357: fleksmage? Pog
[3:05:02] zerossussy: @fleks27 your raid is unlocked
[3:05:02] brotan123: fleks mythic raiding? Pog
[3:05:05] imbatree: they could have both available but a guild can only get one HoF Slot
[3:05:12] brotan123: @fleks27 your raid has arrived
[3:05:19] Pava_TV: let him cook
[3:05:29] sycho_shotz_: that would be poggers for people that have 17-18 show up weekly
[3:05:31] moonblast_w: when is the last time you did a 10 man raid
[3:05:33] matadordebasto: The fights would become easier
[3:05:43] emperorkittens: having it happen after HOF also allows them time to test it
[3:05:44] imbatree: flex would be a balance nightmare
[3:05:50] itsbrand_: what do you think of making fated tokens a thing during regular seasons and max out 2 choices per season?
[3:05:55] cakeslolz: if you have 10 man raids please delete raid buffs
[3:05:59] Wiikz: @matadordebasto and?
[3:06:03] majkos: I think people would be turbo Madge  they have to wait for the flex
[3:06:06] wsinno: with mandatory raid buff/debuff been a thing, 10m mythic raiding does not sound good.
[3:06:09] xPriamx: but pls make the hall 100 we have 150kills on fyrakk
[3:06:27] daevyfan: how would you scale fyrakk seeds with 19 players?
[3:06:27] Rogastik: @imbatree balance doesnt matter after hof closes, at that point fights are nerfed into easy mode
[3:06:35] Thurzoxd: wasn't Hopeful in Limit?
[3:06:35] cakeslolz: what if you buy a trinket then it gets nerfed
[3:06:55] imbatree: @Rogastik then there would be no reason to play new season except for 200 guilds
[3:06:59] itsbrand_: yeah, im still hoping they consider it and max out how many per season we can get to counter getting full bis from raid
[3:07:19] Echo_Esports: Gear up for raid with a world-class sitting experience. Enjoy the same long-lasting comfort as Echo, only with the Secretlab TITAN Evo gaming chair: echogg.ly/secretlab/Gingi
[3:07:19] Moobot: https://discord.gg/JZDJUAZ
[3:07:21] wingstopchickenwings: I think we will be able to buy leggo or something similar to that because of how we could buy sylvannas boy with dinar tokens
[3:07:26] yolles: I keep thinking you've become a vtuber every time I see bottom left Mike KEKW
[3:07:33] Rogastik: @imbatree you are not wrong, no matter what flex raids or 10man raids would cause issues for someone while help others

[3:29:46] cakeslolz: glacial spike ResidentSleeper
[3:29:48] azurehq: freezing raind might be even a thing no ? for the adds

[3:31:14] samiixlol: does anyone have any tips for single target on outlaw? im struggling atm on it
[3:31:33] brotan123: yeah surely COPIUM
[3:31:37] Ontarin92: u trust blizzard?
[3:31:42] unholyhoit: sim YEP
[3:31:43] blessedbygaben: 5Head
[3:31:49] AlsoZen: For example, holy pala
[3:31:54] fleks27: why wouldnt you trust blizzard if they pre announce it
[3:31:56] miiloswow: BM took s3 over s2, s2 is stronger by a bit
[3:31:58] arcaniia007: Blood Dk got s2 tiers sets im so done cba..
[3:32:03] unholyhoit: surely they won't nerf them KEKW
[3:32:03] fleks27: blindly trusting them is sus, annoucement is fine imo
[3:32:05] azurehq: so we will see +35 keys ? :D
[3:32:11] brotan123: its fated they will do zero work
[3:32:21] Ontarin92: "the revenue from this toy will go towards the MDI prize pool"
[3:32:21] orangutan345: A message to the devs.
[3:32:24] skrril: only the best for PVE :/ all pvp players cry
[3:32:30] AlsoZen: I mean, I  don't blame them for not trusting
[3:32:30] Yozomiko: they just need a vendor with all of them
[3:32:36] Zoi888: @miiloswow hunter was a bit diff tho, no tier would change the way you play, couldn't really vote what was most enjoyable
[3:32:43] durcu: why is it hard to find good mages (from what you said earlier)? seems like lots would play when its good?
[3:32:50] VaToXeD: enhance clearly this season is amazing
[3:32:51] Fyeah: apparently mage community enjoys pressing phoenix flames
[3:32:55] VaToXeD: with the less
[3:33:00] TheRatPresident: @Yozomiko amazing suggestion, it will be very easy to balance
[3:33:08] arcaniia007: my body is ready for MDI @GingiTV
[3:33:11] miiloswow: @Zoi888  yeah i agree, I liked S2 cause i pressed BW 10 seconds sooner then i usually do lol
[3:33:16] neateo: WE WANNA MORE PHEONIX FLAME:D
[3:33:16] gambitenjoyer: @durcu its a harder class than most
[3:33:17] TiPera: The voting system should be in game, I feel like a lot of people will not vote
[3:33:34] kwlski01: dh KEKW
[3:33:48] arcaniia007: hopefulx joined echo?
[3:33:49] Yozomiko: @theratpresident who cares lol it’s a filler patch,let people have fun
[3:33:53] unholyhoit: tell that to the 100k overalls in my demon keys KEKW
[3:34:01] VaToXeD: enhancement shaman is punishing too
[3:34:04] WhipdGaming: When did Hopeful join Echo??
[3:34:09] Aro725: lmao common man, a little more than that
[3:34:33] azurehq: a thing i dont get.. i play 20+ keys as a frost mage and i think i play my burst rota perfetcly.. still im not toping the the dmg bars cause mobs are dead to fast of other classes.. is that normal ?
[3:34:40] gambitenjoyer: no what hes saying is correct tho. obviously hes not saying DH only presses immo aura and fel rush
[3:34:47] Franaticcc: The delta between good and bad fire mage is crazy
[3:34:53] gambitenjoyer: but if your popping inertia and pressing the buttons u should be. your gonna be doing good dmg vs a mage doing the same thing
[3:34:54] AlsoZen: Like I said, on mage, the input is not commensurate with the output.
[3:34:54] gambitenjoyer: its true
[3:34:57] zerossussy: Sub rogue dust, good luck doing dmg if u press vanish with ur cds ready
[3:34:58] fleks27: mage has a high entry point to do fine
[3:35:00] gsega: !wake
[3:35:01] TheRatPresident: @Yozomiko everyone cares, because no one enjoys being worse than other classes. the less balanced the game is, the more unhappy a majority of the players will be
[3:35:03] Aro725: I got you its just funny LOL. immo fel rush im out LUL
[3:35:04] vombas: lets be real anyone can do well on dh
[3:35:05] Delias__: DH is low floor high ceiling, Mage is high floor high ceiling
[3:35:07] VaToXeD: you need to do a spec tier list on difficulty
[3:35:12] barbiegirlxxo: If you were someone trying to climb the guild latter to a top X eu guild or smth like that would you consider doing smth like the surge talent > 2x lust for more overall dmg even if its unethical? to get noticed easier and catch the eyes of players who may not know or care abt stuff like that
[3:35:17] Sangturius: esy to but hart du master:-9
[3:35:18] AlsoZen: The precision is not rewarded
[3:35:25] gambitenjoyer: its like league of legends. mage is like ezreal, have some new player touch it the champion is terrible. have a pro touch it and the champion is insane
[3:35:26] zerossussy: sub rogue
[3:35:26] AlsoZen: Just punished
[3:35:26] Happyhedgehogz: like ret
[3:35:28] admiralalaadin: Like the sub rogue
[3:35:30] Fyeah: ill forgive anything they do until the end of this expa if they give us frostfire bolt with Hero Talents CoolCat
[3:35:36] crisher_aj: like unholy dk?
[3:35:39] fazulo21: is arcane harder than fire?
[3:35:47] Aro725: Yeah i realized im too bad at the game to play classes with long cds. I like enhance and DH and just press everything on CD.
[3:35:47] stegaru95: hopeful in meters, not like gingi kekW
[3:35:50] Echo_Esports: Gear up for raid with a world-class sitting experience. Enjoy the same long-lasting comfort as Echo, only with the Secretlab TITAN Evo gaming chair: echogg.ly/secretlab/Gingi
[3:35:53] zini7: according to logs in pvp there is almost no difference in dmg between 1.4 and 2.4k DH
[3:35:54] Sangturius: easy to play but Hart to master :-)
[3:36:17] Franaticcc: @Sangturius more like hard to play even harder to master
[3:36:20] fleks27: monkaS
[3:36:22] jesperswabberwab: use to play fire mage, now ive came back after like 5 years, and i have 0 arms on fire lmao
[3:36:23] unholyhoit: KEKW

[3:36:27] Avengedhonor: mages are players are they lol
[3:36:29] stegaru95: no dude he was top 5 earlier, kekW
[3:36:29] Aro725: @zini7 I think most pvp is like that. Usually the higher you go the better you are at CC and usuing your utility.
[3:36:30] Fury__2003: COPIUM

[3:36:57] marvinsbestfriend: Did Hopeful pass his trial? @GingiTV

[3:37:01] WhipdGaming: Ah, nice! Missed that
[3:37:11] arcaniia007: wait wut i used kekw and didnt play and now i lost 20k points?

[3:38:04] bengreen__: what if you are benched for all of prog
[3:38:05] Rogastik: @Yozomiko pretty normal for any decent guild
[3:38:10] wingstopchickenwings: kush is a pumper
[3:38:11] arcaniia007: but thats such a gamble no? @GingiTV
[3:38:22] miiloswow: i would fail trial in prep alone lmaoo
