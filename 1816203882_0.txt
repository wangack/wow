[1:40:09] OniiDante: nah thats stupid
[1:40:09] Cameleer: its a great rule
[1:40:10] mejstroo: its probably the best rule
[1:40:12] Galfas: its hc after all
[1:40:14] Dethstabz: No trade and AH are the best rules imo
[1:40:14] Fossabot: Sodapoppin's twitter: twitter.com/Sodapoppintv
[1:40:14] mejstroo: every item matters
[1:40:14] greybush317: Didnt realize people could swap between solo and duo in HC
[1:40:15] maylul343: makes buying gold useless
[1:40:17] Airies11: sodaPray
[1:40:17] Sixpoint: that's one of the major points right
[1:40:17] minglem: there should be grouping allowed for elite quests for solos
[1:40:17] tooca_: the only goofy one is mages can't trade water to me
[1:40:20] Gelligan: if you could trade, goldsellers would ruin the game again
[1:40:20] MothersMilk89: Stupidest rule is paladins not allowed to bubble hearth. Its all they've got KEKW
[1:40:20] rusael: it makes enchanting pointless
[1:40:20] Zxandak: cant monitor it so cant happen
[1:40:22] Oopogo1: it's one of the most important parts of HC
[1:40:22] lolidklmaoxd: lw is shit
[1:40:22] petrosgambit: also makes enchanting impossible cuz of rods xdd
[1:40:23] Allemongo: i think trading dungeon gear should be fine.
[1:40:23] DeathToad007: if you could trade  then streamers would get all the loot
[1:40:25] nobbisjunior: imagine the twinking if it was allowed
[1:40:25] franstar91: nah - i dont think it makes alot of sense. even if its "irl" you can trade people
[1:40:25] Ch33ri0s: yeah i like it
[1:40:25] Rycapia: if you can trade then it won't be as hardcore tho
[1:40:25] goingupthemountain: @franstar91 its not, trading and AH will make HC easy. A twink rogue can kill a mob in 1 sec or 1 cheap shot
[1:40:26] Iomtuu: @greybush317 you can't
[1:40:26] carljohnson2331: thats stupid 100%
[1:40:27] tooca_: conjured should be fine
[1:40:27] Cameleer: Not very hardcore if you can just buy gold and trade people
[1:40:29] samoooel: @tooca_ yeah that sucks
[1:40:30] valeksasv8: @greybush317  2 different accs
[1:40:31] qubilly: trade on hardcore fresh realm
[1:40:31] Dynamiterage: enchanting is useless due to BS rod
[1:40:31] HarryBlopper: did they remove immunity at 60? @sodapoppin
[1:40:33] embrs: @greybush317 they cant, you make the choice at the start and stick with it
[1:40:33] Tiinned: Its like Old School Runescape Ironmen. Makes every skill meaningful
[1:40:34] eledan10: Can't trade is a fundamental rule, it's not solo self found if you can just get starter kits from 60s....
[1:40:34] nobanarino: yeah mages not being able to trade water is weird
[1:40:36] shovel_knight25: @greybush317 eeeh pretty sure they cant
[1:40:36] Leroi_Duspam: if you could trade, it would be twink town and take the challenge out of hc
[1:40:37] Cadjule: blacksmithing would be hella worth, armour AND weapons
[1:40:37] Vaelandaras: I just desperately wish you can train more skills
