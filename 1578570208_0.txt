[1:26:08] jaina8675309: you got it off
[1:26:22] CritcobainTV: if it says 0 its off
[1:26:26] CritcobainTV: 100%
[1:26:35] cannibalcanyon: ya i’ve accidentally clicked it at an inn
[1:27:01] ChiefMango: innkeepers
[1:27:04] Qwazaar: thats :tf:
[1:27:04] YaBoyDerkk: if yours says 0% its turned off
[1:27:06] CritcobainTV: any inn keeper, has an option to disable it
[1:27:06] Xeressia: The person that you got your mount and the imp in the ball,etc. One of the options is to deny the buff
[1:27:12] cannibalcanyon: yeah
[1:27:14] Alepouditsa: i have lvl up faster then you buy quest but that is with the 50%
[1:27:17] YaBoyDerkk: u can turn in on and off in major city inns
[1:27:29] cannibalcanyon: no idea but i’m glad i noticed before i left the inn lol
[1:27:36] DeathLV: yes, one npc, the inkeeper Kappa
[1:27:47] CritcobainTV: do a quick lil hearth after this, turn it on and make them summon u :D
[1:28:06] DeathLV: they are all the same inkeeper Kappa
[1:28:19] CritcobainTV: if the lock is able to summon he can summon inside the dungeon now
[1:28:20] Rottencoarse: locks can not summon at this level yet @Towelliee
[1:28:27] CritcobainTV: but i think hes too low
[1:28:38] cannibalcanyon: locks get summon at 20

[1:30:33] IchabodCrain: make em good :D
[1:30:36] Zomgboy: shamans are great y, chainheal bots probably
[1:31:08] DeathLV: they were an allrounder
[1:31:29] DeathLV: you could do everything well, but discs/druids in longterm would probably have betyter aoe healing, palas have better solohealing
[1:31:31] enux337: ^ they did it all
[1:31:32] Shaele: I remember whne my shaman raid leader complained that he has like 20+ buttons to press, when I as an unholy dk at the time I literally had only 2 buttons and was top 2-3 all the time :D
[1:31:45] DeathLV: shams can do everything well, just not as well as these in their specific situations
[1:31:46] Cajete: Shamans were awesome in wotlk, i mained one and a druid
[1:31:56] cannibalcanyon: isn’t there an escort in here too?
[1:31:56] Rottencoarse: you need 1 more hide btw

[1:32:22] Zomgboy: escort is at the start, talk with the tauren
[1:32:25] DeathLV: @Cajete true, but druids' proactive playstyle would make them often beat shammies in aoe
[1:32:53] DeathLV: in terms of when there is raidwide aoe druids have HoTs on everyone while shams still have to cast their spells (and these target like 5 or 6 targets only)
[1:33:31] CritcobainTV: imagine u turned it off at level 5 when u get to falconwign square KEKW

[1:40:02] DeathLV: @Xthe_rad_bradx 50% increased leveling speed + natural leveling speed increase that comes from expansion changing to wrath + wrath content not being available

[1:46:18] CritcobainTV: my friend had the same issue

[2:30:38] mewkittymon: Yes they did
[2:30:51] soge131: You can split Wailing Caverns into 3 dungeons probably KEKW
[2:30:57] Rev_4_Life: Just add speedboosts throughout the dungeon and it would be fine

[2:33:46] Zomgboy: that quest is shared so its gonna take a while...
[2:33:49] Rottencoarse: @Towelliee  i still do not get why did ppl voted for Grimrail
[2:33:53] Zomgboy: as in loot quest
[2:34:13] Rock_tart: early dungeons werent designed to be cleared, they were to be explored
[2:34:28] wEiRdO_dUdE: Grimrail is crazy....it could have been a troll pick, it might have just been because it's something different
[2:35:33] AthenaP47: grimrail has my trinket that never drops
[2:35:42] wEiRdO_dUdE: Accidentally disengage off that sucker.... LUL
[2:35:53] soge131: But it's a train POGGERS
[2:35:59] AthenaP47: quaking, ugh
[2:36:06] neverbornlucky: forgot how easy lvling in ghostlands was
[2:36:28] MOXP: grimrail is a mistake
[2:36:33] dreamwalker213: I’ve never done grimrail until this season and I don’t think it’s as terrible as people make it to be. Rather do that then either Kara key
[2:36:38] Zomgboy: some dungeons just arent it for m+
[2:36:53] NBK_Sethus: yeah when you design something that only hardcore addicts do it's probably a shitty design
[2:37:07] wEiRdO_dUdE: Watching those Great Push people doing Grimrail at 30+ was very neat
[2:37:19] Rev_4_Life: Grimrail would be fine if the camera wasnt bad and the hallways were 40% bigger
[2:38:28] BoezIRL: that wand action
[2:38:28] Slitze: toweliee after hours.. what up
[2:38:47] wakeandbacon95: LUL
[2:39:10] soge131: As Ion said:You think you want it but you don't

[2:45:00] Erielle04: @z0rath pre-patch ptr maybe
[2:45:01] CrusaderNero: adding old dungeons should not come at the expense of new ones
[2:45:02] CritcobainTV: That sword is insane
[2:45:03] Rottencoarse: @z0rath  ptr should be up soon since they closed the last beta like couple days ago
[2:45:06] CritcobainTV: 500 dmg is a lot at that lvl
[2:45:07] SoriinX: I feel like they say they will add new dungeons every xpack, and when we do actually get normally only one its really not received well

[4:31:16] ratgefingah: thats exactly what I am xd
[4:31:31] realnzall: @Towelliee Sorry, you're gonna share in my anguish. It was about a guy who went down on his GF with a JR in his mouth to hide the taste. At some point he lost it and when he thought he found it and bit down on it, it turned out to be a gonnorhea node
[4:31:42] Heyhowsitgoingtonight: WRATH HYPE
[4:32:20] ShadoodHD: @realnzall you just shared it in chat too so :\
[4:32:30] botscast: nobody cares about wrath tho
[4:32:59] kazdin87: bot confirmed
[4:33:00] Highparkk_: i mean if she's hygenic it shouldn't taste bad so dude needed to let his gf know she needed to shower
[4:33:08] Jokervenom1978: Ive been seeing a LOT of advertising for Wrath Classic on youtube
[4:33:17] reverseevolving: @botscast  tf u talkin about lmao :D
[4:33:19] Heyhowsitgoingtonight: his opinion is Law
[4:33:31] geokouts: having more fun now on Classic than on retail at this time
[4:33:34] Highparkk_: @botscast lots of people do
[4:33:36] ratgefingah: omnipotent wow player
[4:33:42] realnzall: @Highparkk_ Could also have been the gonnorhea. Hard to get rid of that with just a shower
[4:33:42] Moobot: Towelliee will be playing WOTLK Classic on the Fresh server Maladath.
[4:33:48] xmedpakx: wrath is hype though to be fair. in a month who knows
[4:33:49] Radiatedpeanut: Seeing the queue yesterday evening on EU servers, i'd say many people care about wrath :p
[4:34:03] Highparkk_: @realnzall yeah that's true lol
[4:34:22] Radiatedpeanut: That's fandoms in general, same for Marvel, Star Wars,...
[4:34:25] enux337: STOP having fun
[4:34:25] CottonEyeGoat: ppl like @botscast destroy the community, or at least try to
[4:34:31] Highparkk_: nobody = themselves obviously
[4:34:58] TheUnknowing: just like there are some people who actually liked shadowlands!
[4:35:01] Heyhowsitgoingtonight: cohh1Guy
[4:35:07] Tyrammus84: I like WoD heh
[4:35:09] Highparkk_: even when it was just me and the homies during garrison simulator it was fun
[4:35:23] warrenny: Me with shadowlands i loved it
[4:35:24] tatqo: i mean last standing from WoW will be.. no Subs
[4:35:49] xmedpakx: correct
[4:35:50] LandoCinema: yes
[4:36:00] reverseevolving: Yessir
[4:36:01] xmedpakx: its a a damn joke
[4:36:09] reverseevolving: Lmao
[4:36:12] Highparkk_: i feel like they're going to at some point bring in lfd right?
[4:36:52] Highparkk_: me personally I like the system
[4:36:57] falldrgn: does this system port you to the dungeon or do you still have to be summoned?
[4:37:02] realnzall: @Towelliee Did they fix that bug yet where  everyone by default gets posted as a tank, even if you can't feasibly do the tank role?
[4:37:04] Heyhowsitgoingtonight: are there more horde or alliance on this fresh server
[4:37:15] Highparkk_: I mean like actually queue up for it and get a group not just sit in the channel and spam dumb stuff
[4:37:18] JohnnyRain: LUL
[4:37:36] MrGharr: after one year, they will release a post, that "We hear you, RECENT feedback says you need LFD one again!"
[4:37:52] Middreks: that's probably because for some reason LFG channel defaulted to /1 when usually /1 is General
[4:38:07] sentait69: LFD overrated lol
[4:38:08] falldrgn: I  just don't get why the didn't just include the LFG tool at launch.
[4:38:26] warrenny: If they listened itd be in noe
[4:38:28] warrenny: Now
[4:38:53] MrGharr: I wonder why they couldn't make 1 fresh realm in each region with LFD enabled.
[4:39:01] LandoCinema: i can queue as a tank priest
[4:39:09] xTheMajorTomx: LFD or as I like to call it  "DPS waiting Simulator"
[4:39:52] Keyastaron_: so I'm in the eastern plaugelands and I'm questing but I don't have any quest icons for them is it intended?
[4:39:55] geokouts: oh yeah the same for me, i can queue as Tank being a Hunter :P
[4:40:33] xTheMajorTomx: Real levellers go the Barrens :D
[4:40:37] reverseevolving: Why dont u flex your other mount? @towelliee
[4:41:01] reverseevolving: @towelliee  hmm ok
[4:41:16] JohnnyRain: barrens is dry and itchy
[4:41:25] xTheMajorTomx: is it because the gamne classifies it as a flying mount in its code?
[4:41:26] xmedpakx: go spend 80 dollars on it to test it for towl
[4:41:40] vangelis_in3: vangelis_in3 subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 4 months! 
[4:41:42] MrGharr: maybe need higher level for that but doesn't say it in UI
[4:41:45] emznev: crazy that for a boost and a mount it costs 80 dollars 💸
[4:42:08] xmedpakx: and cannot use the boost lol
[4:42:19] xmedpakx: sad man
[4:42:28] brian_777777777: i think that is what they call working as intended
[4:42:46] scumlucki: you can get a whole expansion for 80 bucks NotLikeThis
[4:42:58] reverseevolving: @twiztidhatchet KEKW LUL LUL LUL
[4:43:06] silodin: 100% not worth 80 bucks, and i do own all store mounts and digital deluxes
[4:43:14] emznev: I bought it to , just some people can't afford it sadly
[4:43:22] enux337: KEKW
[4:43:33] xTheMajorTomx: Wrath when it came out in 09 was $35 im sure
[4:43:35] MrGharr: also isn't DF cheaper?

[4:44:34] OigreSier: it's like wine it get better with ages
[4:44:37] CommanderKrano: if it would have been 40 euros it would have been an instant buy. but 50 for the version without mount and 80 for the one with the mount? Thats just insane :( Not worth the money for me
[4:44:39] Aidler: bought the epic edition and have the OG collectors edition in the shelf behind me… lol
[4:45:04] Heyhowsitgoingtonight: "value"
[4:45:04] MrsPyra: @silodin If you dont need the gametime its only 65$ realistically So if you think about it that way it isnt that bad to get a mount and boost.
[4:45:12] emznev: I boosted a druid
[4:45:40] JohnnyRain: they should add in the sea turtle mount
[4:45:41] TheUnknowing: 25$ normally
[4:45:42] Jokervenom1978: 2 mounts really
[4:45:45] MrsPyra: 25
[4:45:45] MeisterPetze: 25

[4:46:18] Heyhowsitgoingtonight: towCopium
[4:46:23] dreadlorrddd: mine monthly share of rent (80$)
[4:46:27] Heyhowsitgoingtonight: "good enough" towCopium
[4:46:31] CommanderKrano: doesnt feels like "real" value but more like the 800%-more-value from diablo immortal.
[4:46:44] Aidler: @shrenko should be automatically awarded to the account you selected while buying the epic edition
[4:46:49] MrsPyra: id call that dang cheap rent
[4:46:49] tatqo: yea but 60$ boost is overpriced
[4:46:50] BoezIRL: are you still traveling to sfk?
[4:46:54] scumlucki: Why cant humans be shamans?
[4:46:55] reverseevolving: Is this a PVP or PVE server?
[4:46:59] MrGharr: that must be a dirt cheap rent
[4:47:03] at1c: its just fluff
[4:47:04] LandoCinema: wtf 80$ rent....
[4:47:04] Heyhowsitgoingtonight: towCopium

[4:47:36] emznev: can buy the new call of duty for that a full game haha
[4:47:43] tatqo: yes but boost is cost 60$
[4:47:46] tatqo: overpriced
[4:47:53] CommanderKrano: like 60 dollars for a boost is hella expensive alone. so calculating with that being in there on a lower price and calling it reasonable is a bit... fishy :D
[4:47:56] Highparkk_: call of duty lol
[4:47:59] MrsPyra: 80 in groceries
[4:48:13] PinksChicken: 2 different arguments i think, one saying $80 is a lot. Which for some i'm sure it is. Another saying the spend is worth it which is subjective.
[4:48:21] purarrata: yoyoyoo
[4:48:22] Shrenko: what does the tuskarr companion even do?
[4:48:22] Akuma_Akatsuki: It is a good deal tbh

[4:52:41] darkkmoon: prot pally is so much fun at 70 :) I'm having a blast
[4:53:13] falldrgn: Imean with just the boost and the pet is 85 bucks assuming 60 and 25 for each

[5:04:04] Aidler: and in the digital space there is steam and epic
[5:04:35] ColdIceCreamMan: @Zomgboy it's insanely useful while leveling tho, it also does damage to mobs that are running away and there are quite a lot in classic

[5:08:25] Mallaes: @Mr_BrightsideTTV Some prefer to take their time instead of rushing it
[5:08:26] sentait69: Why even make it an option, lmao
[5:08:43] Skittless96: do only the new realms get the exp buff?
[5:08:49] ShadoodHD: "Turn off Joyous Journeys -- wait wats that again" *looks at xp buff* ooooo
[5:09:11] sLogOG: for "hardcore" players probably, "i'm hardcore bro i don't do bonus exp" Kappa
[5:09:15] Mr_BrightsideTTV: @Mr_BrightsideTTV I mean, I guess
[5:09:22] reverseevolving: Should be down to the left

[5:14:03] reverseevolving: It was so annoying
[5:14:15] reverseevolving: Had to restart so many times
[5:14:21] ColdIceCreamMan: taunt damage is insane, we are running the leveling dungeons currently and aggro pingpong between 3 paladins, this does sooo much damage.
[5:14:22] enux337: you get to use it to start and end a fight
[5:14:49] hgxray: is questing just alot better then dungeon spamming in prepatch?
[5:14:58] scumlucki: what if we get pre patch loo
[5:15:01] NieIas: i also heard that the PTR servers got updated to 10.0 prepatch but theyre not up yet
[5:15:08] ColdIceCreamMan: yea i think they are preparing for beta
[5:15:24] Mr_BrightsideTTV: I saw Tali's latest video on the state of dragonriding, looks sick
[5:15:33] gideonthecrusader: man I'm so disappointed on the pre view on the holy palla talent tree for dragonflight
[5:15:33] Mr_BrightsideTTV: Is the beta coming out soon?
[5:15:36] ColdIceCreamMan: also Holy Pal needs a rework PepeHands
[5:15:42] NieIas: prepatch is supposed to come next month so they gotta test that
[5:15:53] 캥거루복싱: I'm sure dragonriding is going to be boring after a couple of months
[5:16:31] 91Niki: Good morning friends towHi
[5:16:41] Rudric_Ice: i think they announce beta next tuesday
[5:16:48] Mr_BrightsideTTV: @캥거루복싱 I reckon they'll add more talents as the patches go live
[5:16:49] gideonthecrusader: they still seem to stick to the glimmer of light shit, I hate that play style tho. if is still sticking around im prob. rerolling tho
[5:16:51] infinityarty: So far tho the new content looks really fun to dig into, and im talking baout the renown stuff and  completionist content
[5:17:30] ColdIceCreamMan: you basically don't need to heal. i'm running as ret as healer all the time and except for one or two holy lights every two groups I'm just first in the meters
[5:17:47] infinityarty: they proberally just chilled on alpha for wotlk prepatch
[5:18:01] Yagr6: thank god classic has almost ran its course
[5:18:22] theoriginalzinng: people will level in like 3 days and speed run the raids in like an hour and a half and the hype for classic will be over
[5:18:29] theoriginalzinng: back to gdkp runs and boost selling
[5:18:41] maccaruso: "What the hell is wrong with that rogue" - I ask myself that all the time
[5:18:44] Honvar: I can't wait for the beta invite I surely will get Kappa
[5:18:48] jmalmin: Must admit. Not yet tried dragonriding... it didnt excite me when it was announced.. and it does not yet excite me. Did most of that stuff in DCUO a few years ago.
[5:18:59] Syrc0: I just don´t see how they want to lunch DF within the next 60 Workdays (if you dont count weekends).

[5:19:52] infinityarty: prepatch is gonna be so fun with the talenttrees
[5:20:00] ColdIceCreamMan: i'm a little disappointed on the fresh EU server not even the booster groups are 70 yet
[5:20:02] knivkurt: i miss the hype of a game, like the launch when elden ring, a lot of ppl played it, and the launch of vanilla wow  :(
[5:20:06] Syrc0: Technically yes but I dont see that they will lunch it in mide to end December. Therefore you only have September, Oktober and November. So 12 weeks.
[5:20:06] infinityarty: and if they add some content to prepatch i can deffo see myself playing to much again
[5:20:08] theoriginalzinng: i wasnt super hyped for dragon riding until i got alpha and tried it... and its really friggin good
[5:20:29] NieIas: im excited for the prepatch invasions, loved it in legion prepatch
[5:20:41] theoriginalzinng: dragon riding makes normal flying boring
[5:20:50] NieIas: 4 i believe
[5:20:59] Mr_BrightsideTTV: Yeah what's the go with the DF pre-patch, I haven't seen any info on it
[5:21:04] infinityarty: the ones that get you out in the world yhea
[5:21:12] infinityarty: i really liked the legion one for that reason
[5:21:18] Rudric_Ice: Shadowlands is officially over for me got my pvp mount and jelly cat i guess ill just lvl up a DK in classic now
[5:21:20] enux337: legion invasions was fun in azeroth
[5:21:28] ShadoodHD: i love the legion invasion, best time in wow retail :D
[5:21:38] enux337: were*
[5:21:45] NieIas: was so nice to level alts with legion invasions
[5:22:22] Slots1Up: !sever
[5:22:24] akan__toxic: pog just got bliazzard on my mage
[5:22:25] Voqq: And to think, its been 6 years since legion came out
[5:22:39] infinityarty: you think we are able to level from 50-60 tho in the prepatch events?
[5:22:43] ColdIceCreamMan: and also the leveling curve is reduced with 10.0
[5:22:45] theoriginalzinng: selling boosts soon akan
[5:22:52] Mr_BrightsideTTV: I'm so keen to make an Evoker
[5:22:53] Honvar: They must be rare then Kappa
[5:22:56] Slots1Up: is it pvp or pve fresh
[5:23:06] Mr_BrightsideTTV: As a mage and a shaman mage, it looks like the best of both
[5:23:08] reverseevolving: Didnt u see one yesterday. The tree thing
[5:23:14] TheUnknowing: if its like legion you should be able to do it at 1
[5:23:15] Slots1Up: !FRESH |
[5:23:15] Moobot: @Slots1Up Towelliee will be playing WOTLK Classic on the Fresh server Maladath.
[5:23:17] reverseevolving: @honvar lmao
[5:23:26] enux337: yep there were westfall invasions
[5:23:29] ItsDerpDiggler: I haven't seen any rares while leveling yet either
[5:23:31] ublargowilla: in legion level scaling was put in for the event
[5:23:34] TheUnknowing: during legion i was leveling characters from like 1 -100 lol
[5:23:35] jmalmin: yep you could do the legion event from level 1 to max. Having a low level character in your group made the group kill those rares so fast.
[5:23:36] Honvar: @reverseevolving :)
[5:24:27] Rudric_Ice: all the cows and lizards will be out lvling in dungeons in prepatch
[5:24:33] infinityarty: i remember arcane explosion blasting inthose
[5:24:45] Clay2K_: morning
[5:24:48] jmalmin: The scaling goes out of control. its still happening in dungeons. Get a level 10 in your group and you know that dungeon will go fast.
[5:24:49] NieIas: there was a item that low level characters could use and they one shotted the invasion bosses LUL
[5:24:49] coeebra: how long you planning on streaming for today bro
[5:25:09] PadidinJones: I remember there was an exploit in the legion prepatch that Blizz allowed giving you the ability to get to 100 easily

[5:25:38] jmalmin: How many character slots do a account got?
[5:26:29] ItsDerpDiggler: Lol yeah I hit my limit a while back. Had to go to all my servers and decide which ones I wanted to delete NotLikeThis
[5:26:38] mavericks312: prepatch in october?
[5:26:42] DovahChicken: hope they make alot of fun events
[5:26:49] enux337: getting used to the new class
[5:26:52] Mr_BrightsideTTV: I wonder if they'll have some themed catch up gear like they did with the shadowlands pre-patch
[5:27:01] jmalmin: It will take awhile to get used to the new talents. :D
[5:27:02] infinityarty: thats like next month? PogChamp
[5:27:25] Alepouditsa: the must do it at november at 16 when my B-day is Kappa
[5:27:33] Rudric_Ice: blizzard wants evoker mains to play DF rather than lvling another character from the start
[5:28:02] TheUnknowing: totally forgot today was the 1st
[5:28:09] TheUnknowing: lol
[5:28:20] infinityarty: i still have to get all 20s done this season tho, but just 0 motivation to log in besides raiding

[6:06:51] snoopy123lol: if you think about it like at least half of good moveis/shows are based on books
[6:06:57] nightmayor12: set your hearth!
[6:06:59] mavericks312: @Lupine_Fury they probably paid that just to be able to use then name
[6:07:04] NieIas: i saw some interviews with the actors and all they talk about is how proud they are of being it very diverse.. we'll see tho tonight if the show is any good
[6:07:05] WytChapp: But it’s never as good as the books smh

[6:14:17] TheUnknowing: werent people just calling it woke cause it has black hobbits?
[6:14:21] abracka_: it's because there's people of color and shit in the show, so a small minority is losing their collective minds
[6:14:28] WytChapp: I thought it was a cool trailer
[6:14:28] Moobot: towHAMUP Follow Towelliee on twitter so you can be in the know at all times! | twitter.com/towelthetank towKawaii

[6:14:37] BoezIRL: black elved
[6:14:39] mavericks312: its because there are ppl of color in the show
[6:14:40] warrenny: @googstv The mere existence is pandering to the ppl. That claim woke
[6:14:43] BoezIRL: elves*
[6:15:00] TheGiant99: I'm going into it blind

[6:15:19] Shrenko: one of the main characters is a black elf ... thats why people are mad

[6:15:26] Qwazaar: fantasy show breaking their immersion

[6:16:04] LeGoogs: @warrenny Taking a character and making them be someone theyre not, doing things they didnt, goes places they never went isnt mere existence. Making up fake characters isnt "just mere existence"

[6:20:20] Mmmarcoman: Hobbit sucks, when Jackson was asked about elf girls, he was blunt: We knew a lot of teenage girls will see the film, so we had to invent a character that isnt in books. Changes in LOTR trilogy were mostly for the better, in Hobbit was for the owrse
[6:20:26] Rudric_Ice: what about Alpha PepeHands
[6:20:29] mavericks312: cali having power issues?
[6:20:34] Mecabeast: are you gonna try to BF solo strat when you get to your dk?
[6:20:46] KaisenSiru: 106 degrees this weekend HahaSweat
[6:20:53] SweatyT3d: they do that here, managed to install solar and inverter which is amazing @Towelliee <3
[6:20:58] Slitze: Elf from the hobbit is my wife
[6:21:03] DiiscoViking: AH cali power grid, what a shit show
[6:21:10] Sollice: @Towelliee The winner of the WOTLK Epic edition just won gametime as well
[6:21:14] Sollice: DO you care?
[6:21:21] mavericks312: @SweatyT3d I thought about going solar need to do more research on it
[6:21:26] Honvar: And do not charge your electric cars please Kappa
[6:21:34] Rudric_Ice: guess what Percy Jackson wanted to be involved in the series but Amazon denied him so yea
[6:21:48] Sollice: k
[6:21:51] mavros_kyrios: gOT sOLAR... NO POWER WORRIES
[6:21:52] naznarens: I never experienced a power outage at home in 27 years, but have experienced it when going abroad
[6:22:26] NieIas: i call that rigged
[6:22:28] SweatyT3d: @mavericks312 yeah its a game changer, so it goes solar, if its cloudy the inverter then supplies , if the inverter and solar are drained it goes to mains. , if thats not shedding
[6:22:31] Crafty_plays: @Honvar That shit is so funny. California: "We need to push for more electric cars. Save the environment". Also California: "Hey our infrastructure cannot handle the current load so we need to shut your shit off for a while"
[6:22:54] Honvar: Indeed @Crafty_plays
[6:22:56] Alienfromger: hm can you rigg discord giveaways?

[6:25:50] Rudric_Ice: @MrsPyra Trueee
[6:25:52] SweatyT3d: @Sollice that sounds amazing enjoy homie <3
[6:25:53] Crafty_plays: They deal with other weird issues like "which fancy car should I drive" or "how much coke do I need for the weekend"
[6:25:54] BoezIRL: @Sollice towDance towDance towDance
[6:26:05] DiiscoViking: facts
[6:26:10] Aidler: but apparently a lot of people still like to live in cali…. strange but true

[6:26:58] MatsHartvig: @Shrenko, yep
[6:27:01] Fugazi811: flooded because the ground is so dry/hard
[6:27:07] DeCoyThatGuy: vegas this year, had a lot of rain, but that is once every 20yrs. (i live here in vegas)
[6:27:24] mavericks312: @MatsHartvig knut says otherwise on norway lol

[6:31:06] ArcaneMaki: But isn't the taxes thing still an advantage in Cali?

[7:02:49] tmiguel27: Like Tod Said it just work Kappa
[7:03:39] MOXP: what i have learned from shadowlands is not to play any expansion until the last or 2nd to last patch. that's when stuff is fixed and appropriate QOL added
[7:03:48] mavericks312: yea they need to open the work orders in beta
[7:03:58] Rudric_Ice: most players dont care about professions TBH
