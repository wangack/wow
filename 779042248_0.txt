[1:43:32] Eraste: arcane is omega pog
[1:43:40] tyrexxi: Lol
[1:43:52] Fefreedom: towellie so if an item has a level of 25 but your only lvl 20, it doesnt mean you have to be lvl 25 to equip does it
[1:43:54] tyrexxi: finally sockets are good again, in low lvl

[1:45:26] Prixm: How fast is dungeon levling compared to questing? I have levled 3, 10-50s so far since prepatch in about 8-10h each, havent tried dungeons yet

[1:45:37] LinkFi: tbf.. it was pretty cool that ilvl basically went in the trash and it was just like in vanilla where items from the first raid could still be better than items from lets say AQ or whatevre.
[1:45:46] dittademon: @archaic78 thanks!
[1:45:59] lv777ditto: Bliz should allow LFR settings for soloing old dungeons for trans sets for people that are newer or didn't play in that content

[1:47:40] kodemonkee: @Towelliee is dungeon leveling faster?
[1:47:48] Styhllish: het has literally 3 skills then
[1:47:51] theoneeleven: lvl 13 you dont have alot of abilities so single abilities need to do more
[1:47:52] IamHasard: @Towelliee Why not WoD level isn't still fastest XP per hour?
[1:47:56] KaisenSiru: The boss only lasted a few seconds too, so

[1:48:23] LinkFi: yeah but you know what I mean right?? I didnt say all items but lets say Edgemasters handguards or whatever were relevant up to aq40. and I dont mind the progression. it's just there it too high of a value linked to ilvl and the oldschool gearscore. even if you cleared the raid. if your gearscore wasnt high enough you still wouldnt get invites.

[2:24:17] Inishima: Did they fix the Quests? Like the Main Quest in Ardenwald?
[2:24:19] Vol71: @Towelliee I am actually really sad SL was delayed. It was something I look forward to.

[2:25:55] keeindordel: BIG difference
[2:25:58] Adraythien: I just wan't some Q&A

[2:26:22] Eshel: Bwahahahahaha
[2:26:27] Chibs243: @herzenliegen 2021 won’t be any better than 2020, prob worse
[2:26:29] Ledeanna: if they don't release this year they will get sued as pre-orders stated to be released by 12/31/2020

[2:26:49] dankmeliodas: Mid Dec for sure
[2:26:52] feroci2699: I just want scourage invasions to start at least. any date on those?
[2:26:54] Ckn1ght: why cant they just release it the 8th and just have extra time til raids open @Towelliee
[2:26:59] Saiteck: Shadowlands coming out Summer 2021 LUL
[2:27:10] MetallicusGaming: keeindordel how are bgs for xp now with pre patch? they good?
[2:27:12] Eshel: I just don’t see 29th - that’s smack in the middle of holiday season
[2:27:17] geokouts: 1 more to level in Raid!!!
[2:27:19] Deathchampt: cant be 20th between holidays
[2:27:27] Deathchampt: 29th

[2:27:45] Hozz208: not before new years
[2:27:46] keeindordel: EPIC bgs give tons of XP if ur winning
[2:27:53] Ckn1ght: 29th is the end of the holidays. new years is barely a holiday

[2:28:15] keeindordel: i get a lvl and a half everytime i win a epic bg while lvling
[2:28:16] siphira_: TRUE
[2:28:18] saimonest: New Year is the most dissapointing event
[2:28:21] conwats: New Years you just drink. Do that while playing WoW
[2:28:26] Eshel: Most companies give people the 1st off ... thats my reasoning
[2:28:26] manhunni: KEKW
[2:28:28] Hozz208: blizzard wont have anyone to fix issues or pay OT
[2:28:29] xmedpakx: dec 8th release and two weeks to play before xmas, then 3 more week before plus,arena season
[2:28:30] Saiteck: Celebrate New year ingame
[2:28:37] TheExecutionerGaming: I have to fly back here before new years because of Brexit :(

[2:29:00] RazorKameo: i'll be hanging out with my friends. and by hanging out with friends. i mean leveling in wow on my own FeelsBadMan
[2:29:04] mannersgg: my god, the patch made leveling so much fun. i'm out working on loremaster and leveling all my alts at the same time, it's amazing!!!
[2:29:05] keeindordel: tho i wont lie Epic BGs besides Wintergrasp favors range classes for obvious reasons but if ur melee u jsut find a way on how to be useful
[2:29:30] Chibs243: In Scotland, traditionally new year was the big winter holiday. Xmas wasnt much of a thing
[2:29:35] keeindordel: like if ur in AV/ashran in epic bg as a ret pally... help out ur healers with healing /dispelling and get kills if u see an opportunity without u dieing
[2:29:45] siphira_: Just remove ste systems EZ Clap
[2:29:56] Eshel: If it releases the 29th and Blizz gives people day off on the 1st (2 days later) that’s a potential shit show imo
[2:29:57] dankmeliodas: It is for my family
[2:30:00] gaZZelle_: once you hit lvl 30 will you be able to fly in everycontent?
[2:30:08] keeindordel: i will say doing EPIC bgs for lvling as a Marksman hunter is SUPER FUN!!!
[2:30:11] Chibs243: Wasn’t even a public holiday
[2:30:12] manhunni: i havent any family to celebrate christmas at all lol so just a regular day like new year :D
[2:30:29] keeindordel: put ur demonbane trinekt on towile D:
[2:30:34] Chibs243: Presbyterians don’t like Xmas
[2:30:36] keeindordel: UR WoD demonbane trinket! D:
[2:30:44] Ckn1ght: all christmas is for me anymore is just driving around for half the day, its not much fun
[2:30:48] theoneeleven: they shouldnt nerf draenor, rather buff the others to be in line
[2:30:56] MisterD1rty: They haven’t told us anything yet so we at least 2-3 months out.
[2:30:56] Saiteck: Christmas is only for eating until it hurts when you breathe lol
[2:31:01] keeindordel: also tht lil legion banner thing gives a buff
[2:31:04] Maxheadspace: pretty evenly matched
[2:31:11] Eshel: I’m just saying ... 15th would be the latest reasonable date by my figuring (but then again I don’t know shit lol)
[2:31:23] CaptainTVBot: @towelliee The battle is ready to begin! 344 units were placed on the battlefield.
[2:31:35] juiceefruitt: towZap
[2:31:46] keeindordel: @Eshel too close to xmas
[2:31:51] keeindordel: tht would be bad
[2:31:57] Hozz208: @Towelliee holidays will have a lot of people burning through PTO especially with covid, nobody was able to take vacations this summer. Launching a game between xmas and new years, most IT companies have code freezes during the holidays
[2:32:01] RazorKameo: im rolling a ret pal for SL. any tips for someone who has never played paladin before
[2:32:10] keeindordel: ppl would complain about not spending time with family jsut so they can get ahead on gearing and stuff
[2:32:16] rivera9: panicBasket panicBasket panicBasket panicBasket
[2:32:17] Ckn1ght: i'm still thinking nov 17th, i dont think the delay was much more than a pr move for a company that really needed some good pr
[2:32:26] TheUnknowing: not really @keeindordel it gives people 10 days to level and start doing content, having to take a day or two off for christmas isn't going to be bad if you even do
[2:32:30] Humby13: Never used Warmode ever. Its never been about the speed to level.
[2:32:33] MisterD1rty: Played my shammy today, first time since prepatch. Ele and resto feel good
[2:32:33] Eshel: I mean it IS 2020 .... might release on the 26th the way this year is going lmao
[2:32:53] keeindordel: thts still too much time for ppl taking work off tht want to spend time with thier families
[2:32:57] Xedeffen: End him
[2:33:05] parlangua89: @watcherthevillain Bro the game was broken this was a legit push back

[2:47:55] keeindordel: world pvp <3
[2:48:14] metavahn231: its just a worrior dont pretend to be strong cause you beat one
[2:48:14] november23: @bone1155 WoD is faster, but they are pretty speedy. Legion is good if you want class mounts though
[2:48:16] Herzenliegen: lol

[2:49:32] citnes1988: <3 Streamraiders time! <3 Streamraiders time! <3 Streamraiders time! <3
[2:49:44] N3llee: streamers need to buy licenses from game publishers
[2:49:51] N3llee: to stream their games, etc
[2:50:04] TheMounTing: I have resubbed several times because of your streams
[2:50:29] MarkWaffle: My bad if this has been asked but are you using crusader enchant? It gives 100 strength
[2:50:33] Chibs243: Twitch should buy a licence to play all and any music. Problem solved
[2:50:33] Barralgul: It's free publicity
[2:50:35] Ledeanna: Stadia is trying to take the focus off theirs s***ing service that will end up in Google graveyard
[2:50:39] xhriiis: the tweet showing he stole his Twitter banner and removed the watermark without giving credit cracked me up
[2:50:43] Zero_Abyss: Its free ad for them
[2:50:46] Kromede: bobby kotick: hold my beer
[2:50:59] RazorKameo: didnt nintendo used to take a cut from people making youtube videos on their games?
[2:51:03] RageDDO: did you know devin nash accused you of viewbotting or embedding ?
[2:51:03] Staksor: well, same for music. it's just the game publishers understand the benefits
[2:51:03] pk99: Could happen. Could go the way of esports events that have to pay to throw a tourny
[2:51:04] PEEKAHHBOO_ICU: 2020 got people F*cked up
[2:51:07] Maego1: Among Us for example. devs have to be in heaven
[2:51:12] NewWorldReign: @Towelliee So are you safe from DMCA if you're only putting on WoW music?
[2:51:13] valianya: Streamers either purchase the games themselves or are given it in exchange for free publicity
[2:51:26] N3llee: why would a publisher.. Ashes of Creation perfect example. Lazey Peon made that video and boom.. 1 mill sub to their youtube in like a week
[2:51:41] kendorson: at the end of the day, streamers are actually helping these games get money because, a viewer watches a game and can be like "oh I want to play that" then buy the game. Boom money
[2:52:25] Xehanort1986: Battle Ready @Towelliee
[2:52:27] N3llee: Shroud another example.. dude plays squad for a few hhours and now every server literally has a ten player que
[2:52:35] kohwai: @Towelliee think u were 31 when u started
[2:52:37] Ledeanna: yeah developer get payed for content creators already it is called increased sales lol
[2:52:40] TheDreamBirds: battle on stream raiders has been ready for like 20 minutes i think haha
[2:52:42] TheDreamBirds: its all good
[2:52:51] TheDreamBirds: easy to forget stream raiders sometimes tbh
[2:52:56] Stradivarii: Poor music industry, they must be near brancrupt considering how much they wine about aaaaaall the money they lose to this and that
[2:52:58] TheDreamBirds: i do it myself on my stream occasionally
[2:53:16] Supers18: Yeah thats true, like for Single player games
[2:53:17] TrowGundam: For some games, sure, but I wouldn't say most games
[2:53:19] TheDreamBirds: plus stream raiders season ends in 14 hours so feels a bit less rewarding with such little time
[2:53:21] Supers18: i just watch Yt / twitch
[2:53:21] Ckn1ght: thats really only iffy for single player games though
[2:53:22] kohwai: Depends on the game id say
[2:53:31] Maego1: I dont watch new single player games i like until i play them so i dont spoil it :D
[2:53:34] valianya: It works the same way with streamers playing music in the background except dmca publishers apparently don't want free publicity
[2:53:40] joker2880: There some type of games I rather watch than play myself
[2:53:46] CaptainTVBot: towelliee just selected a battle and the action begins in 30 minutes! Head to https://www.streamraiders.com/t/towelliee now to place your units and help earn a victory!
[2:53:46] kendorson: oh 100% streamers help these games not use ads because well you know streamers are bascially showing the viewers the game
[2:53:48] metavahn231: depends on the type of game
[2:53:53] xhriiis: true it works in both ways to some extend but I feel that's normal
[2:53:54] ShadoodHD: did you see jacksepticeye's reply on that tweet?
[2:54:00] Fades1209: any game I'm thinking its an 8 or lower out of 10, I just watch Fotm streamers like Cohh play it
[2:54:01] metavahn231: like if you spoil story based games your fucked
[2:54:08] plumtree45: !sc
[2:54:14] xmedpakx: plenty of games i have seen live i realized were bad from streams and did not buy
[2:54:27] masChinee: Would be really nice to see real studies about this, whether streaming particular game genres increase the sales or not. I've skipped many "story" games just due to fact that I've seen the ending from a streamer and so on.
[2:54:35] xmedpakx: they kinda have a point

[2:54:43] TheUnknowing: we do pay them to play their games, we buy them.
[2:54:51] N3llee: Nope dude is a director on Stadia google's gaming platform
[2:54:54] kendorson: Yea I never heard anyone say that lol
[2:55:04] ESO_HYPE: there has been so many games I was hyped for. but didn't feel like buying it after watching streamers play it
[2:55:07] xhriiis: his product is failing so he has to stay relevant somehow when stadia is failing
[2:55:12] Eshel: It’s like back in the day - you’d go to a friends house and he’d have a game you’d try ... you would then either buy it or pass .... same concept
[2:55:21] CrowCommando: "No such thing as bad press"
[2:55:29] bakkich: Among us is a great example of this
[2:55:37] Stradivarii: I dont even know what Stadia is. Is it a US thing?
[2:55:44] Ledeanna: @towelliee probably a way to take focus off how Stadia will probably be in the Google Graveyard soon lol
[2:55:56] Chibs243: Not too sure how much I buy the argument that streamers sell games. What % of people who play games actually watch streamers? I’d imagine it’s a fairly small %
[2:56:10] TrowGundam: He is a creative director for Stadia
[2:56:10] sxarthur: he does
[2:56:17] xhriiis: creative director of stadia iirc
[2:56:26] Ledeanna: Stadia is a cloud gaming service
[2:56:27] Syllable_: he used to be a game dev i reckon now works for stadia
[2:56:31] keeindordel: kill the shammy afterwards towilee
[2:56:35] Stradivarii: I think tons of people watch streams while playing. Hell I bought an extra monitor for that purpose alone :p
[2:56:36] keeindordel: doo eet! >;D
[2:56:39] metavahn231: thats why too drastic Kappa
[2:56:40] N3llee: Gamers condemn a Google Stadia Montreal Creative Director for saying streamers should be paying publishers
[2:56:43] ElPolloBatman: he's working for stadia montreal, a studio google acquired. he's NOT the creative director of google stadia
[2:56:50] xPapio: so like what if companies purposely make a terrible game to make themselves the underdog for their next release? Kappa
[2:57:06] keeindordel: kil lthem towilee
[2:57:10] keeindordel: keeel them D:
[2:57:13] pinjones: Prot pally op POGGERS
[2:57:13] ElPolloBatman: and google publicly stated that these were his own thoughts and not the company's thoughts, which you're usually not doing unless somebody fucks up

[3:04:46] ElPolloBatman: so how does leveling work now? can you go to legion, grab your artifact weapon, quest around a bit and return once in a while to get some itemlevels, but basically keep it from 1-50?
[3:05:04] Xedeffen: Towelliee, how do you approach being a tank in a new expansion not knowing any fights etc?
[3:05:12] Vol71: @Towelliee Any advice/words of encouragement for someone who just started streaming
[3:05:16] Sambhur: What Plater profile does towelliee use?
[3:05:23] coachingpotatoes: it's hard work to keep the artifact weapon up with your level though

[3:47:28] dym_jt: @TrowGundam there was no takedown request as a far as i know, no offending content. What happens if I constantly re-create the clip?

[3:47:51] Alienfromger: cmon blizz wheres your balance? Kappa
[3:47:57] MarkWaffle: I don't think blizzard will fix it because it doesn't work at level 50 apparently
[3:48:14] TrowGundam: @dym_jt You can't really, the VODs the clips were from should have been deleted as well, so you wouldn't be able to recreate them.
[3:48:16] Hyoss: @bennyrosso that is a weakaura, not a afull addon
[3:48:40] Queen_Zanthana: ohhh i got it.. so neutral enemys have no healtbar lol..?

[3:50:30] blazzedzz: what level are you?
[3:50:33] HairyAreolaus: I wonder how the DKs Fallen Crusader compares...🤔
[3:50:38] Magdelia: under Pog
[3:51:20] blazzedzz: damnnnn
[3:51:24] Malindan: Flower quest sucks though.
[3:51:26] Freddye: You only leveling through dungens.
[3:51:41] Freddye: ?
[3:51:57] Freddye: Oh okidoki
[3:52:10] nihav: As someone who has never played classic wow, is BC a good point to start? How close will it be to Retail in terms of accessibility?
[3:52:12] blazzedzz: it is??
[3:52:25] idenkaz_: oh you have no idea bro
[3:52:39] pereadin: When I leveled my DK I was averaging a level every 25 minutes or so just through questing at level 46-50 so it honestly isn’t too terrible.
[3:52:40] MadFlyPenguin: I would not call it rare, infact its common, people often do it under geared and wipe too LUL
[3:52:44] RazorKameo: ive seen some tanks who dont know what taunt is KEKW
[3:52:46] blazzedzz: been mass pulling since wrath. LUL
[3:53:03] MadFlyPenguin: I just had a group that did that, they did good tho luckily, doing Dead mines.
[3:53:05] th30dor: there's something weird with the scaling. Last dungeon i healed in the tank was squishy af. And he was playing ok. Is it gear?
[3:53:06] coldsarsparilla: thats the problem though, most these people dont have damage meters so they dont understand
[3:53:16] idenkaz_: imagine being a lvl 50 tank pulling half a dungeon with a lvl 12 healer and kick him KEKW yeah abou that
[3:53:31] blazzedzz: I miss having to cc and shit
[3:54:12] Frankenclyde: @blazzedzz felt, i still like to LoS pull when people let me
[3:54:25] InvertLook: @Queen_Zanthana Neutral 'enemies' can, just not NPCs (quest givers etc) afaik. Main Menu > Interface > Names > Always Show Nameplates & Enemy Units
[3:54:54] blazzedzz: yeah just miss the challenge of making groups work together instead of aoe everything mass pull
[3:55:14] sxarthur: well u got M+ for that
[3:55:40] TrowGundam: Expecting PuGs to work together LUL Back then I didn't run anything outside of guild groups
[3:55:43] MetallicusGaming: blazzedzz so are you playing classic then?
[3:55:46] blazzedzz: fasho the game has just changed
[3:55:51] mohmoji: isnt aoe pulling nerfed since the caps? (20 target max)
[3:56:04] pereadin: AoEing as an UH DK and setting things up properly is a science and I love it
[3:56:06] blazzedzz: and yeah I play classic
[3:56:15] RazorKameo: pugs these days dont have any idea how to work together like we did way back when
[3:56:18] MrPiingo: @mohmoji you're dreaming if you think we can still hit 20 targets max LUL
[3:56:30] Riddlz: the game isnt like classic where you cc
[3:56:32] LeJulles: is not even fun anymore
[3:56:37] pinjones: KEKW
[3:56:39] LeJulles: you dont cc in classic ...
[3:56:42] Freddye: I dont miss that at all, stopping 2-3min before every pull is just not fun anymore
[3:56:45] blazzedzz: yeah I totally get it zoomers wont like it
[3:56:46] Alienfromger: thats the way it should be in classic LUL
[3:56:51] Supers18: CC in classic LULW
[3:56:52] MrPiingo: @Towelliee you still do that with bolstering or caster mobs that you cant kick often enough (motherlode, atal dazar, etc)
[3:56:55] mohmoji: @MrPiingo well i took the max cap i heard about, if its less my point is even more substantial
[3:56:57] Storm1854: im ready for bc classic and those heroic dungeons required cc
[3:56:59] pyun23: That's the glory days of WOW dungeons imo.. -(
[3:57:01] blazzedzz: was gonna say we just aoe everything in classic
[3:57:05] RazorKameo: i hate that shit when you get that 1 rogue who gets pissed off when you dont let him cc anything KEKW
[3:57:05] ShadoodHD: real men pull with no plan at all CoolCat
[3:57:05] xiamrs: yeh with a 2 hander also... in zerker stance
[3:57:05] Riddlz: cc in some of the raids
[3:57:07] th30dor: some of the rando dungeon finder pugs are toxic af. Kicking people, rishing people
[3:57:17] WestonTeli: Frost Nova is CC
[3:57:20] MrPiingo: @mohmoji the cap is for most abilities 5. some are at 8. 20 is the so called softcap, which every ability in the game has
[3:57:23] WestonTeli: so a lot of cc in classic lol
[3:57:24] Supers18: classic is a joke
[3:57:25] southy97: when i think ccing in dungeons i think of Cata heroics
[3:57:31] xPapio: i only remember ccing in cata
[3:57:31] grosikx: yeah Cataclysm early Heroicks was nightmare
[3:57:32] MadFlyPenguin: I only remember CCing some special case spots in dungeons at best, and that was just while gearing maybe. Even in heroics
[3:57:36] blazzedzz: I cant wait for classic TBC
[3:57:37] Supers18: BC will be a joke as well, too much min maxing now
[3:57:40] jbandz41: Cc in classic LUL
[3:57:44] stormingdevil007: classic is overall easy

[3:58:08] RazorKameo: its not that classic is easy compared to vanilla its just that everyone is now way better at the game
[3:58:14] 円相: BC heroics was kinda hard where you would almost die on every pull if you didnt cc as far as i remember

[3:58:33] howitser105: BC heroics were no joke
[3:58:37] Storm1854: yep bc heroics were the hardest non mythic+ dungeons
[3:58:41] MadFlyPenguin: BC heroics was hard at the start, then it got nerfed

[3:58:42] Stradivarii: Shattered halls :P
[3:58:42] dym_jt: BC will for sure be better, but still not enough.
[3:58:44] Riddlz: BC will be the same as classic
[3:58:47] mohmoji: i always defended classics difficulty (that its not so easy). but naxx clearly showed me i was wrong... naxx is too easy
[3:58:51] HairyAreolaus: I miss the difficulty of pre nerf Cata dungeons.
[3:58:59] blazzedzz: most of BC challenges was most of the t5 fights were bugged like kale
[3:59:05] Riddlz: as in you think you want it but you dont
[3:59:11] ShadoodHD: who shittalkin monkaS
[3:59:14] Alienfromger: i saw naxx testing looked super easy
[3:59:20] Motakalu: I started in wotlk so no clue how bc started
[3:59:29] Quojin: got a beta key inv from Blizz, havent been able to afford my sub for the past 6 months lol

[3:59:40] pereadin: I’m just here waiting on classic Wrath :-)
[3:59:44] jacob_inc: Is BC servers confirmed?
[3:59:45] blazzedzz: I miss having all the raids matter through all the expansion
[3:59:54] Alaquane: well, when china got BC, there were guilds that killed Illidan with some T3 pieces
[4:00:06] Riddlz: lol those skellies in the front of kara hit like a truck

[4:01:13] blazzedzz: Kara and gruuls were sooooo badass
[4:01:14] pk99: whats this mess about drums meta in bc?
[4:01:33] ShadoodHD: damn i forgot what was nerfed on that patch LUL
[4:01:39] mohmoji: BC is the same situation as classic. just another flavor. i think bc will be trashed the same way as classic was. i heard so many arguments about naxx with the patch will be hard as f*k and its a joke
[4:02:37] Stradivarii: NAxx was hard back then, now people go in there with years of raiding experience :P
[4:02:37] blazzedzz: the hardest part of classic back in the day was your dial up internet LUL
[4:02:52] jason_tacey: LUL
[4:03:12] Quillix84: 3 months and tbc is cleared if they don't gate all the dungeons
[4:03:24] Lichenoss: HYPERS
[4:03:28] CodyDaBrodie: crusader is the best for str classes, whats the best for int?
[4:03:46] Quillix84: cause when tbc launches you can go into every raid once you have attunements and guilds have already practiced and got it down to about a 3month full clear of the expansion
[4:03:52] Ekvision: So how many 50's have we got now?
[4:03:53] Quillix84: 3 months for all
[4:03:57] Quillix84: though
[4:04:02] Malindan: Nope but tbc will still be easier then it used to be because of all the stuff players know these days
[4:04:34] dym_jt: @Towelliee how long time did it take before Kael to die in TBC back in the days? He wasn't beaten until after BC released right? How long time will it take in "Classic BC"?
[4:04:36] CaptainTVBot: @towelliee The battle is ready to begin! 517 units were placed on the battlefield.
[4:04:42] Quillix84: So, unless they make it so you can't go into X raid until Y day TBC will get cleared super fast
[4:04:58] Toasti0: Looking forward to pally tank being busted. Hope they dont' drive it into the ground like bfa beta.
[4:05:07] mohmoji: @HoTepian absolutely
[4:05:10] IMMproveko: imagine vashj with the tainted core throwing
[4:05:18] Malindan: Smaller raid sizes as well
[4:05:21] MetallicusGaming: They don't need to carry 7 they just need to carry me LUL Kappa
[4:05:24] Quillix84: Im saying 1-5 raids it takes 3 months
[4:05:30] Quillix84: 5 raids = 3 months
[4:05:38] stohliak: are they going to require the stupid attunements?
[4:05:43] mohmoji: @Towelliee i believe you. but i swear i heard exactly the same about classic
[4:05:49] swiftyhealer: I'm having trouble doing my level 15 ranking should I be doing battleground or 2v2
[4:05:49] Alaquane: I think there were later patches that removed the attunements

[4:06:00] Ebony71: attunement was ANNOYING!

[4:06:03] othraerir: it's complicated ;)
[4:06:09] Malindan: That chart was beefy
[4:06:13] DeadlyDag: Attunements was AMAZING.

[4:06:18] Moobot: Ask a moderator for permission before posting a link, @FMJayce (warning)
[4:06:24] Quillix84: Well, in the defense of the classic debate classic was easier cause you also had patched skill that didnt come out for like 2 years after vanilla launched
[4:06:28] DeadlyDag: Glad we got the title (and achievements)
[4:06:33] superleonidka: Attunement is great mechanic, very sad they removed it
[4:06:34] Stradivarii: I HATED attunements after onyxia
[4:06:37] FMJayce: RIP didnt realize mysub ran out
[4:06:42] ShadoodHD: @Ezekyler TRIGGERED NotLikeThis
[4:06:42] juryvicious2: I LOVE that chart, no joke.
[4:06:43] 3663Sharad: fml
[4:06:49] dym_jt: attunements will get rid of the laziest, the bottom of the food chain, that's all, it's not insanely hard.
[4:06:50] stohliak: I didnt raid much in BC, they made a wall of sorts around it.
[4:06:50] Ezekyler: John Madden Attunemet KEKW
[4:06:52] 3663Sharad: that chart
[4:06:55] ShadoodHD: look at all those nonsense
[4:06:57] Toasti0: Time to buy 6900xtx
[4:07:03] jason_tacey: attunement ptsd LUL
[4:07:06] Raaeni: almost as bad as the wildstar attunements
[4:07:24] Malindan: So glad I was a noon in those days and didn't raid
[4:07:26] ShadoodHD: ah the good ol days -- fuck that stupid ass attunements with its stupid keys
[4:07:28] Malindan: Noob
[4:07:37] superleonidka: So I am the only who love atunement system? LUL
[4:07:40] Jay_rb: KEKW
[4:07:42] juryvicious2: Come on, mad respect for it
[4:07:44] ZzZanu: man for me tbc is and will be the best expansion, maybe its nostalgia but thats how i feel
[4:07:53] Malindan: @towelliee streamraiders battle is ready
[4:07:55] Sloth710: Soooo whats the word with the Shadowlands xpac @Towelliee
[4:07:55] Quillix84: Not saying classic is hard, cause its not. the gear / skill revamps that were in at the launch made it about 75% easier though to clear the intial gearing phases
[4:07:58] Riddlz: outside kara
[4:08:00] dym_jt: @Towelliee level 70 at bottom
[4:08:02] othraerir: it's epic

[4:08:18] 3663Sharad: Im very curious how the meeting turned out at the very start of these questlines :D
[4:08:25] othraerir: getting rep for heroics

[4:10:37] dym_jt: @kbeltz85 much like dungeons in vanilla that were thought to require tons of crowd control were facerolled, shattered halls will be by far smoother than it were in BC, not saying it's going to BE easy, but easier.

[5:04:16] amricatt: Iron Man was great. That was the first one I saw that pulled me into the Marvel universe. There are still a lot of movies I haven't seen though.
[5:04:20] TrowGundam: Ya, Ultron was trash compared to what he is in the comics, kind of sad
[5:04:22] MetalManGG: Ultron should have been a two-part Avengers movie like Thanos
[5:04:25] pk99: age of ultron was wack

[5:06:11] reinhardtdog: The difference is Black Widow movie is done lol
[5:06:17] RogueBear: its a continuity error but tbh she had a pretty thick accent in Age of Ultron. i understood her well enough but i could see some people having a hard time with it
[5:06:29] Ekvision: that warrior has less dps than the healer
[5:06:39] henrikjuncker: spunkern subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 8 months!

[5:07:01] kbeltz85: yeah i bet they end up doing with it like Mulan, charge you to watch it on Disney +
[5:07:04] TheCliffyShow: Disney is just fucking sitting on it.
[5:07:04] Rane_Tehp: @ekvision try to use chars that gives you fast queues for dungeons? Like healers and tanks?
[5:07:09] th30dor: @RogueBear but whats the point? What value does the heavy accent, which got changed, bring to the character? Seems like a gimmick to try to show how authentic she is that fell on it's face
[5:07:15] henrikjuncker: damn my name sounds dirty whern americans says it
[5:07:26] xerofith: @Quojin not the disney channel but their streaming service so its gonna be on disney+

[5:29:36] panzera4: at this point they should just give a skip cinematic option
[5:29:56] KormTV: beginning of BFA was super bugged for me. I couldn't get my neck for 3 days.
[5:29:57] Owenzzz123: i remember in wod there was a telescope or something right at the start of the horde garrison bit that only one person could click on at a time
[5:30:01] Aervyper: there should be a NO cinematic option
[5:30:01] JonnyScotland: I just moved my main to a different realm because of that. Was on silvermoon EU
[5:30:06] Owenzzz123: was a huge bottleneck for the first few hours until it was fixed
[5:30:11] Ramrocc: nah nothing is gonna happen, blizzard got this Kappa

[5:32:24] Bugszy: blizzard told them too delete man lol
[5:32:55] RuneMeisterKris: Power to you for trying to get the VODs, I know it's a lot of work and many streamers aren't willing/able to doit
[5:33:06] th30dor: monkaTTOS
[5:33:30] th30dor: that was such a poorly handled announcement, holy hell
[5:33:36] MrGattz: im still putting $20 on absolutely nothing will happen
[5:33:36] th30dor: you have 2 days. go panic
[5:34:07] Quarrion: do I need to delete my vods if I had 0 viwers watching? :P
[5:34:09] EpicJune: Nah those companies will want their money
[5:34:10] RuneMeisterKris: It'll cost more than $20 if something DOES happen tho LUL
[5:34:18] golli9: Still a sleazy way for Twitch to reduce their storage costs
[5:34:18] TheCliffyShow: I deleted all my vods, highlights, and clips. And, I haven't played copyrighted music since the last wave of DMCA bans.
[5:34:19] Aaradin: yes
[5:34:25] th30dor: meh, fck that. Whoever is willing to risk his entire livelihood, after being specifically warned, is crazy
[5:34:41] Araksus: Yo just give streamers the ability to license music.
[5:35:04] sir_vanillin: burn towHype towRage
[5:35:10] Antdavs24: damn
[5:35:14] t_emperor_of_mankind: @Towelliee Is the "catch up" implemented yet, or is that only with the pre-patch event?
[5:35:23] SadDingus: wut a mess
[5:35:48] FerociouzMonk: trivium a band got shut down for playing and making their own music live on twitch :P
[5:35:51] Tyr7: So what happens to all the stuff made from JustinTV days?
[5:35:58] skirratlast: Hey dudes! do i get to play classhall-campains if i level in legion?
[5:36:03] golli9: most streamers couldn't afford the asking price to license music for their channel
[5:36:04] JonnyScotland: better safe than sorry
[5:36:12] remixonfire91: DMCA is just retard , streamers listening to music of artists only expose the musics even more to audience that maybe could buy that record etc
[5:36:12] MrGattz: those vods have been gone for a long time
[5:36:14] vylh: after the dark? PepeHands
[5:36:18] RuneMeisterKris: Speaking of Twitter, did you see the Tweet from the Google Stadia guy saying Streamers should pay companies to stream their games?
[5:36:18] cabalish: rip the past save the future
[5:36:23] Xolido: that kinda sad - fook music :D
[5:36:24] Xedeffen: Where can we find it though, like if we wanna re watch?
[5:36:37] Grunton: justin tv was very not legal people streamed movie
[5:36:37] Anbean: so, what CAN you play after todays?
[5:37:03] JonnyScotland: So what happens to an irl streamer that walks past somewhere that has music playing outside?
[5:37:07] RunningOutOfRAM: aka nothing LUL
[5:37:09] fewyn: so basically nothing
[5:37:10] Xedeffen: So you wont upload to YouTube for like an archive?
[5:37:12] idenkaz_: basically nothing
[5:37:14] Simperfit_tv: Can't you just upload it in a peertube or something
[5:37:16] MrGattz: so if you have a monstercat license, you can play that.
[5:37:18] Honvar: start a OnlyClips? Kappa
[5:37:20] amricatt: So you can't even play WoW's music?
[5:37:23] Honvar: An*
[5:37:24] Teknofear64: !battle
[5:37:24] Moobot: Play Stream Raiders with me at https://www.streamraiders.com/t/towelliee LETS OWN THE BATTLEFIELD!
[5:37:26] Araksus: How do they know you have the rights or not
[5:37:27] MrGattz: in game music from games that dont out source their music
[5:37:30] JuninBeyond: the DMCA thing seems weird though, like why isnt there a simple solution to it yet, like a company selling people rights to play music or whatever
[5:37:31] idenkaz_: WoW music is fine.
[5:37:40] Malarick: so if you buy the music you can use it?
[5:37:47] remixonfire91: well wow and monstercat music are the only good ones
[5:37:51] MOXP: or just underground psytrance stuff
[5:37:51] tetrahydridodinitrogen: I hope it isnt like youtube where you get DMCA'd for stuff like police sirens or rain drops because a song has in it
[5:37:59] EpicJune: .....for now Kappa
[5:37:59] RunningOutOfRAM: how about some GachiHyper :/
[5:37:59] TheCliffyShow: Or just search copyright free music on Youtube.
[5:38:03] el_Pachuco: technobase.fm is good to use haha :D
[5:38:05] D4rkmask: Luminiare buying licences to play music is already a thing, just massively expensive\
[5:38:06] golli9: Movies have to license music from artists that they play even a snippet of, because it is part of a performance the movie company makes money from
[5:38:06] th30dor: very specific music, that is very clearly marked as rights-free. or you purchase or negotiate some sort of agreement with some record or label company to play their music
[5:38:12] Anbean: ok so are you going to play any music at all?
[5:38:17] Freddye: I never understood why people cant just have their own music in the background listening to a stream, then you can even choose yourself.
[5:38:18] cabalish: wow music is made in-house, many games music not
[5:38:23] JuninBeyond: @D4rkmask how much
[5:38:28] Simperfit_tv: you can use sportify to play free music
[5:38:36] Grunton: you know there will be like my twitch guy said Im good
[5:38:36] odain896: I think its absoulty disgusting this whole sue culture the world has gotten too.
[5:38:39] EpicJune: what about pop tunes on like the sports games?
[5:38:40] DoomerReflex: I made so much alts, 2x10 and doing this scenario so many times. :D
[5:38:42] Darquesoul: Tpain made beats for streamers to use
[5:38:47] StreamElements: Download Raid: Shadow Legends, for free on PC and Mobile!https://strms.net/raid_towelliee_timer
[5:38:51] itssalsashark: SOFI TUKKER got DMCA'd on Twitch for playing THEIR OWN MUSIC LIVE. It's so bad
[5:38:52] Darquesoul: you can't use his old stuff though
[5:38:54] idenkaz_: just because you buy a license doesnt give you permission to stream it for free. thats the problem
[5:39:07] TheCliffyShow: I got taken down live for raunchy fan art I had on screen.
[5:39:09] D4rkmask: Luminiare depends on whos music and how much probably, but in the thousands most likely (just guessing, havent looked it up)
[5:39:14] get_bent009: its just so crazy that you can play a game like GTA, or even Cyberpunk and a little bit of music can get you DMCA'd
[5:39:14] Moobot: towHAMUP Follow Towelliee on twitter! https://twitter.com/towelthetank and on YouTube! https://www.youtube.com/user/Consolecrusader towHAMUP
[5:39:14] Notic: thats so fucked
[5:39:15] golli9: yeah a license to reuse the music for commercial gain is expensive
[5:39:16] Exodeo_: Just deleted all my stuff despite not even streaming anymore, thanks for the warning :)
[5:39:17] th30dor: imagine streaming GTA RP, and you talking to some dude and he has music running in the background. And instantly you get taken down
[5:39:18] itssalsashark: Questlove got hit for playing Roots music
[5:39:18] DeanoTV: so what if you play normal music but dont save the vod?
[5:39:21] JonnyScotland: What about a licence radio stations buy? I guess it's insanely expensive?
[5:39:22] D4rkmask: more popular stuff is going to be more expensive
[5:39:33] falldrgn: so what If I pay for access to the music service..would I still be liable?
[5:39:35] Storm1854: leveling in Hellfire Peninsula and narrowly avoided trhe Fel Reaver jesus he was so scary in BC @Towelliee
[5:39:38] riyo96: whats the fastest way to level as a tank? dungeons or questing?
[5:39:42] jubee240: you can stream music now?
[5:39:46] jubee240: cant
[5:39:49] shanoobis: I've always preferred in game music or the streamers chat, playing music isn't particularly entertaining
[5:39:52] EpicJune: trolls gonna use this to fuck streamers LUL
[5:39:54] Tyr7: So all those old world firsts etc.. can never be played again on stream? so will they still be available on youtube etc?
[5:39:55] trollinmyimp: So literally no music anymore?
[5:39:57] Grunton: music labs are money hungry
[5:40:03] Darquesoul: I think it's Universal says that they have a team who can monitor streams for music but says they haven't used it yet
[5:40:16] saimonest: just go and try what happens
[5:40:16] D4rkmask: falldrgn you pay for the right for YOU to listen to it, not to broadcast it in something that makes you money effectively
[5:40:18] DoomerReflex: @Towelliee Hey always you can sign for us :D
[5:40:19] th30dor: @falldrgn you payed for access for yourself. Not to distribute it to other people. Unless very specifically mentioned
[5:40:23] itssalsashark: @JonnyScotland You have to purchase a sync license because it's playing a video at the same time; the same license commercials pay. Up to 100k PER SONG
[5:40:26] DunnwichDK: time to increase music speed by 1.5 and lower the pitch
[5:40:28] Riddlz: They will hit the major streamers first then the small ones
[5:40:36] golli9: They (radio stations) pay a fee to the licensing agency based on how many times they play a song. Why do you think having a top 40 song makes artists rich
[5:40:38] KristineTheUnicorn: It's going down.. I'm yelling Timbeeer towClap
[5:40:46] mixieg: Why do record companies waste time and money on hurting streamers?
[5:40:48] exWan: You can listen to a radio station.
[5:40:54] vylh: im just surprised it took this many years before the Music industry to catch on with Twitch and how music has been just used to help others attain cash yet give nothing to the artists
[5:40:54] byrdeen45: Got beta invite last night

[5:41:18] th30dor: @varkith89 time to mute the music monkaS
[5:41:25] DewWut: pathetic that twitch does take care of this, they have been shitting in the wind forever on it
[5:41:30] NewWorldReign: they fucking baiting him
[5:41:36] golli9: @mixieg because people listening to streamers doesnt translate into the listeners spending money on the music/artists
[5:41:44] saimonest: still the music authors song
[5:41:46] itssalsashark: What matters is if the MPAA is enforcing copystrikes for the music
[5:41:49] golli9: "exposure" dont pay the bills
[5:41:50] Takobaited: probably more than a social media manager would know, gotta wait for a official statement
[5:41:50] cabalish: in-house could also be non label and no license, its complicated
[5:41:54] JonnyScotland: What a mess
[5:41:55] Overbuilt_Gaming: pretty soon you'll have to license game companies to stream their game
[5:41:58] Grunton: if they have a soundtrack it might not be
[5:42:01] ur_levelup: @Towelliee The solution seems to have a live heavy metal band in your studio for each stream
[5:42:01] Moobot: Check out Towelliee's latest Youtube video! https://youtu.be/-eGBUXg0d_A BEST PROT PALADIN COVENANT FOR M+
[5:42:03] othraerir: like trent reznor did with the original quake
[5:42:12] CADZtv: so do streamers have to turn off like the radio on gta everytime they get in the car loool\
[5:42:15] kbeltz85: @varkith89 Square Enix's music stipulation is as long as there is gameplay their music then they are 100% OK with it. That goes for Youtube as well.
[5:42:17] get_bent009: just wait, this is going to turn into needing a license to stream games
[5:42:20] itssalsashark: @Overbuilt_Gaming There is already talk about that. I'm pretty sure we'd start rioting thoguh
[5:42:22] tubbyrhino: it's the same as when they make songs for movies. like James bond movie songs
[5:42:24] flipx1: just stream the game with no sound
[5:42:26] MOLAR305: is gta still causing people to get DMCA?
[5:42:27] get_bent009: and its going to be terrible
[5:42:30] t_emperor_of_mankind: All of this started with Lars... back in my younger days.
[5:42:33] JonnyScotland: Everyone back to safe wow, Will just be wow streamers left lol
[5:42:35] Lilyofthemyst: I feel bad for people getting hit with dmca for random sounds - like the gta5 peeps and police sirens
[5:42:38] Malarky33: god bless nuclear blast
[5:42:59] th30dor: and can you blame him @Towelliee ? It's your livelihood.
[5:43:05] PToastman: He doesn’t play music
[5:43:06] MrGattz: theres a point at which its not worth worrying over.
[5:43:08] higanheim: @Towelliee can you stream to your headphones but no one on stream hear it?
[5:43:11] Quojin: i looked into getting a broadcasting license in the UK, nothing covers streaming
[5:43:11] Raaeni: dan who?
[5:43:14] Grunton: its gonna be old dan replays only
[5:43:15] FerociouzMonk: if a game has a soundtrack in it, shouldnt it be considered fair use.
[5:43:19] kalmenus1: Fallout 76 basically a streamer dmca torpedo
[5:43:19] varkith89: @varkith89 but twitch mutes the vods because of the BGM for copyright music????
[5:43:31] bakkich: @PToastman music in the game could picked up = one strike
[5:43:33] EpicJune: yeah wouldn't trust NBA on that LUL
[5:43:35] itssalsashark: @Towelliee Stuff like Plug.dj is going to take off. Having the streamers syncing what they hear with people watching on demand. best workaround.
[5:43:36] JonnyScotland: Nintendo are bad for abusing dmca
[5:43:39] EpicJune: 2k i mean
[5:43:39] PToastman: Which is why he is worried
[5:43:40] Antdavs24: no sport game is safe if thats the case
[5:43:42] th30dor: probably not LUL
[5:43:44] Aervyper: @Towelliee so what your saying is starting today NO ONE is going to play a nintendo game on stream LOL
[5:43:44] RuneMeisterKris: The new Tony Hawk game had that too recently
[5:43:45] ur_levelup: if you have a broadcasters license in the US does twitch exempt you?
[5:43:47] tubbyrhino: theres no way 2k owns those songs
[5:43:50] CADZtv: i feel like if its apart of the video game you cant dmca that
[5:43:53] MrGattz: you cant escape it, just go with the flow and if you get hit then idk. sue someone for job loss.
[5:43:56] DunnwichDK: lol mute 2k and play some YEE HAW music
[5:43:59] othraerir: i doubt you would be able to
[5:44:01] NewWorldReign: 2K has the license via the artists singing the songs
[5:44:01] get_bent009: @Antdavs24 just mute the ingame music, they all have the option to
[5:44:01] Raaeni: wait a minute wheres my sub badge?
[5:44:02] mia__leeloo: do it and find out KEKW
[5:44:06] Raaeni: oh there it is lol
[5:44:07] higanheim: @Towelliee can you stream to your headphones but no one on stream hear it?
[5:44:13] Overbuilt_Gaming: 2k doesn't have to own it, they have licensed it for use in their game
[5:44:17] PToastman: Asking a streamer to not play Spotify Is easy. Asking a streamer to not play games with any music is soul crushing
[5:44:17] shanoobis: just like movies they licence it for a certain amount of time
[5:44:19] keterych: Classy af
[5:44:21] xirangeix: PogChamp
[5:44:21] Charles_Winston: Pog
[5:44:22] idenkaz_: People should be worried and should take it srly. Because the moment the first real big streamer gets axed shit is on fire @MrGattz
[5:44:24] sharie: PogChamp
[5:44:25] th30dor: But 2K does not have the right to extend their distribution right to you, the streamer
[5:44:26] intellectslol: They gonna rise up from the graves and strike you
[5:44:27] golli9: How many streamers have more money for lawyers than the record companies?
[5:44:28] RogueBear: its licenced to be used in the game but not your stream
[5:44:30] RuneMeisterKris: Mongolian Throat Singing
[5:44:34] DunnwichDK: im sure theres some ska
[5:44:34] itssalsashark: They buy game distribution licenses. Those also only last a set amount of time. That's why games like Rock Band stopped selling copies
[5:44:36] cabalish: that music uses licenses too
[5:44:36] lefty_cgc: @Towelliee 2k has a license to use them in game. Not for people that bought it to rebroadcast the songs. There was the same problem with GTA.
[5:44:41] Antdavs24: @get_bent009 thats morbid
[5:44:42] xirangeix: No it doesnt
[5:44:46] Grunton: games have licenses but people dont to stream the music in it
[5:44:46] Alienfromger: i think there is no dmca on old music
[5:44:48] skylaars: u care about the world series tdog?
[5:44:49] xirangeix: After I think 100 years music is free to use.
[5:44:50] goblinknows: Did someone say banjo KKona
[5:44:51] upinurguts: There are tons of Royalty free Music sites if you have to have music
[5:44:53] itssalsashark: @golli9 None. They have BILLIONS for litigation
[5:44:57] Riddlz: DA DA DING DING DING DING DING DING
[5:44:59] get_bent009: @Antdavs24 i agree, the laws regarding this stuff are so fucked
[5:45:01] golli9: exactly.
[5:45:03] DunnwichDK: why are so many people suckin money from songs
[5:45:13] Broomba: !uptime
[5:45:13] Moobot: Towelliee has been live for 5h 45m
[5:45:14] idenkaz_: they pay GEMA its different
[5:45:18] Krelborn: I bet we are gonna se a lot of cases of game developlers giving the green light to play the game soundtrack and streamers still get hit with a dmca
[5:45:19] Takobaited: streamers bringing out the tea and crumpets, bangin out to beethoven's 5th
[5:45:22] EpicJune: That's sound pretty bad tbh
[5:45:26] Antdavs24: @get_bent009 fucked is the only way to explain it
[5:45:28] Malarky33: There are streamers who post their clips on youtube to figure out if they are copyright free LUL
[5:45:33] Grunton: youtube will tell you where in a video to twitch they don't tell you shit
[5:45:35] RuneMeisterKris: Imagine de-monetizing a 9 year veteran and staple of your platform
[5:45:43] Malarky33: Because Twitch system is flawed
[5:45:43] othraerir: the law needs a rework, that's for sure
[5:45:47] dewking93: Good am @Towelliee
[5:45:48] th30dor: @Krelborn ye. Same with artists. An artist can give you the go ahead, while their record label will DMCA the shit out of you @Towelliee
[5:45:54] sharie: lets Rock Bethovens 5th Symphony
[5:45:59] sharie: towPog
[5:46:01] MrGattz: @magemyway i say not to worry for that exact reason. someone big is going to get hit. that someone is going to put up an enormous fight and then maybe someone will actually change something. or they will go stream on youtube.
[5:46:03] JonnyScotland: What if Twitch buy rights for their content creators to play games with certain soundtracks?
[5:46:03] Overbuilt_Gaming: what we need is some politicians to get involved and sort all this out KEKW
[5:46:04] Cacos: @othraerir Was about to say that. Given this industry is is the millions already
[5:46:13] Z_Shontonga: That happens all over YouTube already..false DMCA's, even if the content creator has rights/permission...just a report is a strike.
[5:46:15] Motivess: where is the paladin quick access to order hall in dal again?
[5:46:15] Moobot: towHAMUP Towelliee Gaming is proud to be sponsored by ORIGIN PC! Learn more and use my link ---> https://www.originpc.com/?aid=864668
[5:46:17] higanheim: @Towelliee can you stream to your headphones but no one on stream hear it? sorry for asking 3 times, I'm just wondering if YOU can listen to music with your stream program open
[5:46:19] Etherdon: It'll be like youtube where players get DMCA claimed even if they're playing their OWN original music.
[5:46:24] Shinji_Ex: cause the bot are out of control I think know has the code to control it skynet shit
[5:46:38] Dracus_Dark: @th30dor Not just the label - some pop songs have 20+ writer credits - they all own a part of the copyright
[5:46:40] LoseAlotLuke: man ICC dance off, forgot about those, rip @Towelliee
[5:46:42] TheMcNutt: TheMcNutt subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 5 months! 
[5:46:42] MrGattz: @jhexx92 oh ofc. yeah as long as no one else can hear it they dont care. how would they know if no one else but you can hear it lol
[5:46:42] Moobot: Thanks for subscribing for 5 months, @THEMCNUTT towHAMUP
[5:46:48] Alienfromger: laws are so complex even lawyers dont know shit
[5:46:49] Noshpan: @Etherdon That actually happened to Danny Baronowsky
[5:46:50] itssalsashark: @jhexx92 Yeah, things like Plug.dj will become way more popular. He can hear what we play, and we can open a tab and listen too
[5:47:00] th30dor: @Towelliee bruv night when you sometimes listen to an oldie, or a new song. KEKW
[5:47:07] higanheim: i was just wondering if he had the ability to listen to tunes, like if there was program communication error or something
[5:47:08] Krelborn: @th30dor Totally. Gonna be a shit show untill som kind of system or partnership with twitch/amazon gets worked out
[5:47:10] Malak044: i dont think they specifically know either. It's just they get request about music X and they just run some algo like shazam to find offending vod and flag them. That's it i think ?
[5:47:10] MrGattz: its not that the laws are complex at all. its that the law is literally actually from 1998
[5:47:15] idenkaz_: @MrGattz no offense but this is utter bs. dont hope for a big streamer to change the entire industry, this will never happen. We´re talking billions of $ what is a big streamers word worth? nothing.
[5:47:16] LoseAlotLuke: @Towelliee how will cyberpunk work, they have worked with tonnes of big artists for the music in their game
[5:47:18] golli9: If the 'exposure" that artists get from streamers playing music translated into money for the companies/artists this wouldn't be an issue
[5:47:18] spiritowltv: monstercat is out?
[5:47:20] MrGattz: internet didnt even exist then and we have a law for it
[5:47:24] Riddlz: just pay for the use of it to stream it :P
[5:47:30] elchico702: 100% u cant be sure, gotta wipe it all, damn shame
[5:47:31] Antdavs24: the logistics behind it to are so borked, some remixes are good, some are bad smh
[5:47:31] Dracus_Dark: @Towelliee Dropped Frames had Mike Shinoda on and he explained some of the issues with copyright holders.
[5:47:32] Thoreya: you would think that Twitch would find a way to fix this shit to cover their asses but
[5:47:39] Overbuilt_Gaming: you've made blizzard a lot of money
[5:47:46] JonnyScotland: There has even been issues where games have been took off the stream store because they have a song in them and the devs didn't update their music licence for the song
[5:47:46] Moobot: Towelliee's girlfriend, twitch.tv/lulaboo, has a brand new cookbook! If you like cooking or know someone who does, check out this fully tablet/pc/phone compatible cookbook for only $9.99! https://lulas-store.myteespring.co/listing/lulaboo-cook-ebook?product=960Featuring
[5:47:52] JWoody82: pretty sure there was a good stretch of Danger Zone on sub sunday back in the day
[5:47:53] Thoreya: like Youtube and facebook
[5:47:55] Frostfury: 1 Fat Kappa
[5:47:57] SadDingus: and thats probably the endgame of all this
[5:47:58] sir_vanillin: fat towRee towFeelsgood
[5:47:59] Antdavs24: it'll definitely be PHAT LUL
[5:48:00] panzera4: don't give them any ideas
[5:48:03] ChillinMoose: Money solves everything
[5:48:05] MrGattz: @bone1155 MC is fine as long as you have a license from MC to play their music
[5:48:07] xxKrayzie: biggest mafia = Music Industrie!
[5:48:07] pereadin: There are ways for people to still listen to DMCA music privately and have game music on their stream. I used to do it all the time, you were actually my inspiration to switching to that method. @Towelliee
[5:48:14] Malak044: aint it a good thing ? compare it to radio industry ?
[5:48:16] GoatForSale: you can do a similar thing on BandCamp to get access to their library
[5:48:17] Siddydiddydo: music industry isnt taht smart though, they only care about money, and you not getting any
[5:48:21] dragin1320: more viewers = more of a fee i thnk is the best way imo
[5:48:21] Mrstreet619: That’s garbage
[5:48:21] cabalish: online license like spotify should be the future yeah
[5:48:21] cleanstrikes: I think paying for a license would be best
[5:48:29] RuneMeisterKris: Then comes the game license that Stadia guy wants streamers to pay
[5:48:32] higanheim: @MrGattz i wonder how he could mute a program like spotify, it might be easier than i'm thinking
[5:48:32] Broomba: Days of old twitch streaming are gone: no more towelliee after dark, streams where content was original and free to express fun and creativity
[5:48:33] FluffehZ: towOof i missed who gave me a sub, towHAMUP towHAMUP towHAMUP
[5:48:36] golli9: If you buy a DVD of a movie, it doesn't give you rights to set up a neghborhood drive in where you charge people to come watch it
[5:48:36] idenkaz_: yeah but where does the money go? what will be bought from it what deals will be made with twitch? money alone doesnt solve anything here.
[5:48:39] MrGattz: radio industry is completely different than streaming
[5:48:41] pereadin: how much was it? couldn't hear before
[5:48:42] Etherdon: Companies always look to squeeze more revenue. The fee will always happen.
[5:48:44] RunningOutOfRAM: @Towelliee so it is all about money ;D
[5:48:44] Nathan_Grey: @Towelliee Imagine if you stream IRL content and come across some music
[5:48:48] MrGattz: totally other set of laws
[5:48:50] volesus: isnt there music apps with royalty free m
[5:48:51] StreamElements: Download Raid: Shadow Legends, for free on PC and Mobile!https://strms.net/raid_towelliee_timer
[5:48:54] squigglytv: @FluffySwede check Notification on top bar
[5:48:54] Grunton: twitch hasnt really done much but make the platform to stream to program for anything
[5:48:55] DunnwichDK: sounds like music taxes
[5:48:55] Dillon_J: yea let me just whip out my 1000 $ Kappa
[5:48:56] FerociouzMonk: LIQUID COCAINE AND CHICKS
[5:48:56] SadDingus: same thing happens with showing NFL games in bars, bar owners have to pay a huge fee
[5:48:57] Cereaz: @Towelliee what about monstercat? i think it is like a few bucks and not thousands of $$?
[5:48:58] panzera4: think more realistically it will be based on the number of viewers or subscribers
[5:49:00] zorish: some mafia levels of bullshittery eh?
[5:49:06] Joey_CZ: LUL
[5:49:06] upinurguts: RIAA Would never go for it, the dispersal of funds to Royalties would be a nightmare
[5:49:06] garandor: It's been like that for years already in bars / restaurants etc... they need to pay to play music aswell. Only normal.
[5:49:07] Dracus_Dark: The flat fee would be a problem for smaller streamers and if you take a small percentage it would be "unfair" or larger streamers - its just not easy
[5:49:10] KristineTheUnicorn: Don't Sing, they might DMCA D:
[5:49:11] Aervyper: @Towelliee sounds like you working for the mob man....
[5:49:11] FluffehZ: @squigglymootv i did but i did not pay attention towLul
[5:49:11] sir_vanillin: cash flow towLul
[5:49:14] Mezmorised: Dr Lupo has been deleting his clips. He's been running a program live for the past 12 hours. He's deleted almost 800k clips so far
[5:49:23] th30dor: but it doesnt work like that. Separate agreements need to be made between twitch and every record label. Or between streamer and record label. And then you'll need to check if this is ok or not @Towelliee
[5:49:25] MrGattz: it would be very well over $1000
[5:49:27] Broomba: Money goes to god
[5:49:31] RunningOutOfRAM: TIMES CHANGE
[5:49:38] MrGattz: your talking $10k+
[5:49:39] Alienfromger: RIP songrequests
[5:49:47] shanoobis: the biggest problem is licencing starts at $50 a song for once use and just goes up from there
[5:49:48] NILLme: with blizzard's growing greed its possible..
[5:49:53] bhxkazzam1: you can only stream lizzard game for 500$ a month incoming
[5:49:59] Lilyofthemyst: Most artists get pennies from their music, it all goes to the corporates
[5:50:00] dewking93: how much does a dcma claim cost twitch?
[5:50:01] WebsterLou: 10k+ for music rights is probably right
[5:50:02] MrGattz: and it would more than likely scale price with how many viewers you have
[5:50:05] keterych: Yeah the weekend could get wild
[5:50:12] Antdavs24: what if you're paying for spotify and just playing music off there Kappa 4Head
[5:50:12] frippiee: i mean its activision blizzard we're talking about, im sure they'll do it just to get more money
[5:50:12] BlindFaithFuel: I was watching a streamer yesterday that said even WoW music was no go
[5:50:13] cleanstrikes: well its the weekend so we'll probably have to wait til next week
[5:50:15] EliteFourJosh: What did you think of that guy's take about streamers paying game devs?
[5:50:20] PToastman: Relying on blizzards good manners seems kind of iffy when it’s your career but that is just me
[5:50:25] MrGattz: correct
[5:50:36] Grunton: theyhave too
[5:50:39] Dracus_Dark: Shinoda mentioned that a movie licensing for a Linkin park song for instance cost $100k And thats "just" for a movie
[5:50:39] Aervyper: well GTA V will be the test site right? that's more or less what is live right now but will be like what Cyberpunk 2077 will be like
[5:50:41] obeysupreme76: Shifty said blizz dmca him
[5:50:42] CaptainTVBot: @towelliee The battle is ready to begin! 671 units were placed on the battlefield.
[5:50:44] th30dor: @PToastman absolutely. These are businesses, and their purpose is to make money, not to protect you
[5:50:44] Xedeffen: geez
[5:50:46] TrowGundam: Their only obligation should be to removing the offending content. The banning after 3 strikes is kind of for their conveince
[5:50:51] KristineTheUnicorn: Battle Ready! :)
[5:50:54] SHJordanx: cost them time and attorney fees i guess
[5:51:04] shanoobis: $500,000 fine if the dmca claim is ignored
[5:51:15] Grunton: its more music lables they far in the past with laws
[5:51:19] Takobaited: Blizz has too many flak as it is, that would tank their public image LMAO
[5:51:19] idenkaz_: because they want the big money. streams blew up so much its considered mainstream now. ofc they get after their asses now KEKW
[5:51:20] Thunderbrew: Blizzard isn't worried about their in game music.
[5:51:25] MrGattz: @shanoobis which is still pocket lint to twitch but.
[5:51:26] CADZtv: i dont think video game developers care about their music being on streamers or videos
[5:51:34] elchico702: could Blizzaerd dmca playing wow?
[5:51:37] Antdavs24: @Dracus_Dark i wonder if shinoda gets dmca'd for playing LP/FM music towTinfoil
[5:51:48] TrowGundam: @SHJordanx Only if it has to be fought in court. The acutal request is bascially a simple form that you submit. Some strreamers have done it for channels stealing emotes without permission
[5:51:55] Xellana287: tbh I like the wow streams more with blizzard music. Much more atmospheric than some random chart music
[5:51:57] Dracus_Dark: @JAYMURCS They dont, if they own all the copyrights on said music
[5:51:57] Silverbella: Not when it's thousands of streamers getting strikes, MrGattz
[5:52:00] th30dor: @Towelliee but you never know when suddenly Blizz sub-contracts some orchestra somewhere, and to reduce costs, it changes something in the rights part of the contract. And suddenly its out of blizz hands
[5:52:01] jerexify: @Towelliee Congrats on 400+ level 10s!
[5:52:01] Moobot: Check out Towelliee's latest Youtube video! https://youtu.be/-eGBUXg0d_A BEST PROT PALADIN COVENANT FOR M+
[5:52:01] MrGattz: @elchico702 and game dev ever can technically dmca someone for playing their game while streaming
[5:52:03] Alienfromger: @elchico702 ofc they could like nintendo years ago
[5:52:08] garandor: In belgium a standard pub or restaurant pays around 500 euro's yearly to play any music they want . it's been like that for years. And most of that money goes back to the music right owners.
[5:52:08] shanoobis: repeat offence is $1million and up to 10 years jail though
[5:52:17] dragin1320: idk i feel like you should have to pay for the use. everythinng else needs rights to play it. sucks but its right imo
[5:52:18] TrowGundam: @SHJordanx Which is actualy one of the reasons why the system is so broken, because it can be abused with very little consequence
[5:52:19] MrGattz: any*
[5:52:26] HeavyMetta: Blizzard as we knew it is dead , if Bobby smells money he will get his way
[5:52:34] Rane_Tehp: !RAID
[5:52:34] StreamElements: Download Raid: Shadow Legends, for free on PC and Mobile!https://strms.net/raid_towelliee_bot
[5:52:34] th30dor: true
[5:52:36] keterych: Should monkaS
[5:52:40] CADZtv: @Dracus_Dark yh thats my point in house music made by them or so on
[5:52:46] Broomba: Artists appear to have power and we don’t know how it goes
[5:52:48] NovaPrime92: I think it's time to change these archaic copyright laws lol
[5:52:48] Cntrl_Gaming: They are chasing down money they were probably making from missed concerts etc.
[5:52:53] Dracus_Dark: @MrGattz Thats why many games add in the EULA that you CAN stream the game even for profit
[5:52:53] Zellidon: Yeah if a game doesn't make their own music it's prob gonna get DMCA'd
[5:52:53] FerociouzMonk: you shouldnt be banned but you will kinda Kappa
[5:53:00] Motivess: For some reason I don't have any order hall quests showing for my pally, is there somewhere else I need to go to find them? @Towelliee
[5:53:01] elchico702: @MrGattz @Alienfromger damn then this might get seriois ty
[5:53:03] griffdog125: so no more Dance Dance Rev. Twitch girl streams lol
[5:53:07] RuneMeisterKris: The music industry just has everyone by the nuts and it's such garbage
[5:53:08] Takobaited: tbf that's just a social media manager, saying "uh let's check" is someone covering their ass
[5:53:11] Rane_Tehp: I'm back
[5:53:16] Thunderbrew: When will game developers not allow you to stream their game on twitch. Kappa
[5:53:18] keterych: Try it Kappa
[5:53:19] Riddlz: If the game dev company makes the music and publishes it then you are good.
[5:53:20] Menion01: They have a month still. It's not like you NEED an answer right now.
[5:53:21] idenkaz_: the first night wire they said its inhouse made music and copyright free to stream. no they cant even a clear answer KEKW times changed
[5:53:23] ShadoodHD: we're going straight to the wild wild west -- wait shit dmca
[5:53:23] Etherdon: Yeah, It'll be scary. Can you get DMCAed for even the game itself playing its own music when you're in it.
[5:53:28] Antdavs24: it literally sounds like its a throw at a dart board, depends which label wants to take action more or not
[5:53:28] soopaGreg: beta test it :D
[5:53:29] falldrgn: Why are they doing this now? Wouldn't this be an ongoing issue?
[5:53:34] bhxkazzam1: that what happen when non gamer make rules and policies, there plenty of grey zone
[5:53:35] MrGattz: @Antdavs24 correct
[5:53:36] mojusk: sounds like a threat
[5:53:38] Rane_Tehp: I'm trying to remember my raid shadowlegends account, since I had to reboot my pc...
[5:53:38] Grunton: if a game has a soundtrack its can be dmca
[5:53:41] sillen142: Commander, the battle is about to start and we need your guidance.
[5:53:42] golli9: I think this will hit the courts (maybe even supreme court) to resolve the meaning of "Fair Use" in the contextof streaming
[5:53:50] Broomba: It’s like Russian roulette @towelliee you might shoot your self and you might live
[5:53:52] Shrenko: GTA radio monkaS
[5:53:54] Jonyvy: So right now, you guys can't pay to stream the music, and they don't get the "free advertising", so it's a lose lose situation for both parties. These things blow my mind
[5:53:54] keterych: That is wild
[5:53:57] DigitalChill: Twitch in 2021: Just mute everything but yer mic
[5:53:59] FerociouzMonk: play some Dimmu Borgir thats not mainstream Kappa
[5:54:00] TrowGundam: Somebody needs to make a database of games that have music that could be hit or has been hit by DMCA in the past. Would be a great resource for streamers
[5:54:01] Zellidon: FAllout is a good example. I got copyright notices on my youtube for songs playing on a RADIO in FALLOUT LUL
[5:54:05] Kronosrebus: games gonn have to start developing streamer modes. where music is muted
[5:54:08] MrGattz: @Antdavs24 the very large majority of this entire situation is throw a dart
[5:54:09] falldrgn: To quote EA.. "If its in the game, its in the game"
[5:54:10] DieselDesigns: Welcome to the World of YT. I've gotten copyright warnings from videos done 4 months ago. Usually the first song you hear in the game.
[5:54:10] Dillon_J: GTA RP KEKWlaugh
[5:54:13] othraerir: nuclear blast are a pretty big label
[5:54:18] keterych: Yeah they need to be updated
[5:54:18] Thunderbrew: I still say that viewers can play their own music.
[5:54:19] pk99: New game intro screen music going to get someone banned before they can turn it off LUL
[5:54:19] MrGattz: 1998.
[5:54:21] Siddydiddydo: the laws are severely out of date
[5:54:22] TruVenomTv: they want their hands in the pot now
[5:54:30] HeavyMetta: Just play your own T , mute it for us than we put on our own favorites
[5:54:35] cabalish: huge club takedowns happened years ago for the same reason
[5:54:39] DunnwichDK: weve come along ways in the past 20 years of cuckin humanity
[5:54:41] Antdavs24: @MrGattz the only way to explain it honestly, just one big giant crap shoot
[5:54:44] Noshpan: A FFXIV streamer I sometimes watch just had all of their clips deleted because it had in-game music for FFXIV
[5:54:47] Riddlz: But twitch knew the laws and let ppl get away with it
[5:54:57] obeysupreme76: Nba2k music rip
[5:55:01] falldrgn: so how much of this is corps and how much his "ambulance chaser" DMCA lawyers?
[5:55:04] Jimmy__Ricard: I depends on the contract the company has with the artists that create the music. Sometimes the company owns the rights to the music, other times the artists does.
[5:55:07] Krelborn: There need to be some kinda list from twitch/amazons part of games that are allowed to be streamed with the soundtrack on
[5:55:15] Dracus_Dark: @Riddlz Oh yes, this dates back to JustinTV days
[5:55:18] ShadoodHD: @Noshpan oh man... which one?
[5:55:20] kbeltz85: ill blame Napster!
[5:55:22] Dillon_J: XIV is okay with you playing there music as long as you are playing htere game, excluding answers
[5:55:30] Noshpan: @ShadoodHD Ferro
[5:55:37] citnes1988: when streamraiders
[5:55:43] MrGattz: @Riddlz yeah but only because no one came to them to tell them to stop it till now. twitch isnt going out looking for trouble
[5:55:44] NILLme: interesting haircut :D
[5:56:07] falldrgn: Hes a smart Panda..
[5:56:22] Noshpan: @Dillon_J Ferro had their FFXIV clips deleted because it had FFXIV music in it.
[5:56:22] Dillon_J: LUL
[5:56:26] TrowGundam: Twitch just needs to move their resources out of the USA, BAM no more being suspetible to outdate US Laws Kappa
[5:56:32] DigitalChill: well who cares if we steal from her :P
[5:56:32] intellectslol: It's an easy fix though, twitch just needs to make a proper platform for companies to file takedowns and require them to link the vod, then just forward that takedown request to said streamer
[5:56:36] CADZtv: looooool
[5:56:39] keterych: LUL love it
[5:56:39] jasperboy: yaa fookin cunt
[5:56:39] cabalish: o love him
[5:56:39] Shrenko: OI MATE
[5:56:40] CADZtv: not wrong
[5:56:41] sharie: Oi Cunts
[5:56:43] Antdavs24: thats the problem antiquated laws and dumb people not listening
[5:56:45] oraclespyro: truth
[5:56:49] shanoobis: Panda rocks
[5:56:49] jason_tacey: hahah yeah Panda's a great guy
[5:56:52] Frostfury: Don't fuck around with Panda XD
[5:56:58] Broomba: Straight shooter
[5:56:59] Honvar: can we copystrike pewdiepie? :)
[5:57:05] jason_tacey: fookin cunts
[5:57:16] Riddlz: LOL there goes asomnd
[5:57:20] Ekvision: ariana who?
[5:57:25] keterych: Lmao
[5:57:35] Grunton: react streamers better be carful there videos don't have music
[5:57:36] Dillon_J: @Ekvision ariana venti
[5:57:37] keterych: A live take down would be wild
[5:57:38] RuneMeisterKris: Streamers: *play big time music on spotify* Twitch: *DMCA's* Streamers: pikaOMG
[5:57:38] bsraider: @Towelliee you can use any amazon music tho right?
[5:57:38] pk99: didn't herman li say you can play all the dragonforce you want?
[5:57:47] Antdavs24: imagine getting dmca'd for ariana grande Kappa
[5:57:47] TrowGundam: The record companies are fucking vindictive. They purposefully wait till they ahve multiple offenses just to shut down channels. It's happened many times on youtube
[5:57:48] Riddlz: Asmond now needs to get a JOB
[5:57:54] Broomba: Like an avalanche
[5:57:55] Riddlz: :P
[5:58:07] CADZtv: wait really?
[5:58:09] Antdavs24: live take downs would be some crazy shit
[5:58:10] L0ck0ut: couple of streamers i follow have been running programs to delete all past content overnight just to make sure
[5:58:13] SubQ: well, now i just have to learn how to make my own music.
[5:58:16] golli9: It's like wearing masks. You wear a mask for a while, then think "oh nothing happened" then you get more lax. Next thing you know RONA
[5:58:16] dewking93: they could be watching right now
[5:58:16] Dracus_Dark: @Riddlz He has one..OTK :p
[5:58:16] Etherdon: It'll be like Blizzard. They dont ban people all the time. They gather a bunch then slam the hammer.
[5:58:31] NewYorkBeard: It's not that hard to just not stream music
[5:58:37] Honvar: It's fun to stay at the DMCA Kappa
[5:58:38] Alienfromger: there are always fault with such systems. someone will get banned without any fault
[5:58:39] CADZtv: cause alot of streamers are tryna counter it by not saving their vods and clips
[5:58:47] Grunton: crazy
[5:58:50] falldrgn: I had a friend get a DMCA strike, from his label. He was playing his own music.. like his band
[5:58:52] intellectslol: this whole problem is just happening because twitch + streamers are all lazy af
[5:58:53] StreamElements: Download Raid: Shadow Legends, for free on PC and Mobile!https://strms.net/raid_towelliee_timer
[5:59:05] kay4964: How do you delete videos @Towelliee
[5:59:09] GermanBacon: 1000
[5:59:11] CADZtv: oh a fuck ton
[5:59:12] falldrgn: Did we keep the Sha Clip?
[5:59:13] MrSupernoodles: Dr Lupo has had over 700,000 deleted so far monkaS

[5:59:15] L0ck0ut: example... drlupo has removed 738,825 clips overnight
[5:59:15] Ashe_x: minimum 10k
[5:59:20] TrowGundam: I know several streamers that just disabled clips and the saving of VODs outright.
[5:59:22] RunningOutOfRAM: some as his weight around 20000 k
[5:59:24] Broomba: @intellectslol laws are outdated like 20 year
[5:59:28] D4rkmask: falldrgn thats the thing, the artist doesnt always own the rights to the music, its the production company they use that owns it
[5:59:30] Shrenko: The worst thing is that they have to delete Reckfuls old VODS.... @Towelliee
[5:59:35] MatthewFoss: Soon Twitch will finally have enough space to be able to download Modern Warfare on their servers
[5:59:38] mavericks312: probably like 20-30k clips
[5:59:44] winchez_: free up some hardrive space lmao
[5:59:48] othraerir: how can you delete clips made by other people? are they all stored on twitch too?
[5:59:51] heatedblankit: heatedblankit subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 27 months, currently on a 8 month streak! towHAMUP waffleH lirikHS
[5:59:51] Moobot: @HEATEDBLANKIT with the 27 months re-sub! towHAMUP
[5:59:54] Grunton: just dance is a nono game now
[5:59:55] Aquadriel: MatthewFoss KEKW
[6:00:00] dewking93: @MatthewFoss i doubt
[6:00:00] Ashe_x: lupo in 2017 at 738k
[6:00:03] Etherdon: So what this means is. Twitch just freed up petabytes of data storage, and they are jumping for joy.
[6:00:03] Dillon_J: LUL
[6:00:05] Alienfromger: the PURGE we need more space lol
[6:00:12] intellectslol: @Broomba okay? twitch is protected from litigation under the law though so long as they respond to takedown requests, they just need a better platform for that
[6:00:13] Seppic: haha yea what are they gonna do with all that server space now?
[6:00:14] Antdavs24: lupo is literally streaming himself purging his VODs LUL
[6:00:14] Shrenko: rip GTA RP streamers
[6:00:17] Nathan_Grey: @Towelliee All content prior to this day should be DMCA Free
[6:00:23] D4rkmask: falldrgn so unless your someone like Mike Shenoda or Dragonforce whove recently PRODUCED their own music they arent safe
[6:00:28] Ekvision: twitch just wanted some more diskspace :P @Towelliee
[6:00:42] Malarky33: Sadge
[6:00:43] RuneMeisterKris: THE SHA CLIP
[6:00:43] falldrgn: @D4rkmask yeah.. it was a not pretty situation. Ended clearing itself up pretty quickly. The Label just didn't understand what he was doing.
[6:00:46] ChiefMango: twitch really made it easy for you guys to remove, lol
[6:00:47] Hangalik: towHAMUP towHAMUP towHAMUP
[6:00:54] MrGattz: oh yeah rip sha
[6:00:57] HeavyMetta: Twitch should have an option to hide , than delete but i guess they where not prepared
[6:00:59] Hangalik: towHAMUP
[6:01:01] Antdavs24: make sure Sha clip is good!
[6:01:03] sir_vanillin: F to pay respect for clips towHype towCry
[6:01:04] intellectslol: twitch just needs to make it easy for companies to file takedown requests & for streamers to see them and react
[6:01:06] Shrenko: I have so many good old clip of you Towelliee PepeHands
[6:01:07] othraerir: ah ok thanks, always wondered how that would work

[6:01:19] bhxkazzam1: why cant they run dmca on all content and delete it themselves?
[6:01:21] dewking93: lets just start our own band
[6:01:24] RuneMeisterKris: !sha
[6:01:24] Moobot: WE DID IT REDDIT! AFTER 2100+ ATTEMPTS WE GOT SHA!! BYAHHHH! towByah towByah https://clips.twitch.tv/BillowingBusyFinchOSfrog
[6:01:37] D4rkmask: falldrgn well thats good to hear. nice that people can come to and understanding on these things
[6:01:37] Z_Shontonga: If they ran the DMCA...it would be strikes.
[6:01:38] TrowGundam: @Towelliee It is crazy. Mike Shinoda, from Linkin Park, was on Dropped Frames. He says he can't even play music that he owns the full rights too, because it will still get flagged by the automated systems. He could get appealed, but it doesn't stop the initial request
[6:01:40] Rane_Tehp: @MrGattz Don't be mean!
[6:01:47] TheCliffyShow: That's like saying, "all movies should be free to watch."
[6:01:50] Shinji_Ex: lot of music lables are even confused they been giving permission to say burke, but cause bots are dumb
[6:01:53] FluffehZ: @Towelliee Did you know your not even allowed to use spotify while streaming? it's in the first rule in the Terms of use danScare
[6:02:00] Pallananana: dmca came across twitch... and found itself a goldmine FeelsBadMan
[6:02:03] MarquisLek: you only deleted the links to the vods
[6:02:03] Moobot: Check out Towelliee's latest Youtube video! https://youtu.be/-eGBUXg0d_A BEST PROT PALADIN COVENANT FOR M+
[6:02:03] Ekvision: all clips should also be YMCA free
[6:02:09] MrGattz: @fyrese cohhFeels
[6:02:10] MarquisLek: the vods themselves still exist
[6:02:16] griznasty94: thats a lot of data....what if they are lying
[6:02:19] Broomba: It’s just not publicly accessed
[6:02:26] Rane_Tehp: @MrGattz give me luck for HH please thank you
[6:02:36] drwoody_1337: Whasts up Dad!
[6:02:41] JonnyScotland: I got copyright striked on youtube for just playing final fantasy with no music apart from ingame
[6:02:43] MrGattz: wait whats hh?
[6:02:45] Riddlz: NOTHING IS EVER DELETED FROM THE INTERNET :p
[6:02:50] Aulendyl: @griznasty94 It's Amazon, they have a loooooot of storage
[6:02:56] squigglytv: @MrGattz Headless Horseman
[6:02:58] Sprucemoose: @towelliee battle ready
[6:03:00] MrGattz: ohhhh
[6:03:01] D4rkmask: MrGattz cohhBoop
[6:03:02] drizzt_dourdn: @MrGattz Headless Horseman mount
[6:03:08] Broomba: There’s no beta keys to those private servers for twitch
[6:03:11] Rane_Tehp: @MrGattz headless horseman :c
[6:03:11] MarquisLek: some kind of blob storage
[6:03:13] MrGattz: @fyrese right haha good luck!! you got this this year :P
[6:03:14] CollateralDamage25: Exhibit 12A5X2
[6:03:15] turbofreee: how about the streamers who allow people to play youtube clips, I guess they will need to stop?
[6:03:36] MrGattz: see i play path of exile and HH to me is always Head Hunter lol
[6:03:43] TrowGundam: Ya, once something is on the internet it is never deleted. It is gonna be crazy when they start DMCA'ing stuff on 3rd party archiving sites
[6:03:45] Broomba: Where did u level this pally mostly ? @towelliee
[6:03:56] MrSkelly25: Conspiracy theory: twitch sparked the DMCA fear hype to open up shit load of public server space and knock down overhead
[6:03:58] RuneMeisterKris: On Lupo's purge stream it says Twitch can't restore Clips
[6:04:13] drizzt_dourdn: @MrGattz sadly I never could get into POE...I tried really hard tho
[6:04:22] Speshulist: wouldn't it have been better to just mute audio for them so you can see which ones are bad and why?
[6:04:27] Broomba: Ok ty
[6:04:27] KKrugzz: why couldn't they just make all the VODs Private and lock them that way?
[6:04:36] TheFabilolz: I just checked DrLupo, he delete almost 800000 clips so far....
[6:04:39] MrGattz: @RuneMeisterKris eh. they can. nothing is ever just magically gone. twitch legally has to store everything for like 7 years or something
[6:04:51] dewking93: @Towelliee so could you just play the music and then delete the vod?
[6:05:06] D4rkmask: Corstro they can strike a live stream
[6:05:08] mojusk: @Towelliee did you know that you can skip this intro quest line by running through the portal instear of starting the FOR AZEROTH qust
[6:05:16] shale93: @Towelliee this WoD intro questline is skippable even in chromie time if you didnt know
[6:05:18] Thunderbrew: Bugs me that Khadgar always can out run me
[6:05:27] ForgottenTime: @thefabilolz Why did he do that?
[6:05:30] fewyn: there is only zul
[6:05:35] panzera4: DCMA POLICE GET ON THE GROUND
[6:05:35] squigglytv: so what music is allowed? Royalty free and Remixes?
[6:05:38] ForgottenTime: Oh nvm I see dmca
[6:05:44] griznasty94: a dark era
[6:05:46] Storm1854: @Towelliee do you know how youtube handles their streamers and music they stream because i'm curious
[6:05:47] byrdeen45: its stupid
[6:05:48] griznasty94: a quiet era
[6:05:48] falldrgn: what brough this on?
[6:05:53] Villie: Sadge
[6:05:54] TheCliffyShow: Mad Twitch: Beyond DMCA Dome
[6:05:56] Broomba: @mojusk you can also take the secret portal from panda land too
[6:06:01] xDreddx: alot of xp
[6:06:03] dewking93: this is twitches version of WOD
[6:06:03] NovaPrime92: expect to see a lot of monstercat music on everyones streams lol
[6:06:07] thebakeriscomingforu: you get 3 to 5 levels from it
[6:06:08] MrGattz: WAIT you can skip that???
[6:06:10] bearsnuggles: I am guessing someone is sueing twitch over copyright
[6:06:15] Riddlz: LOL next Twitch will then require streamers to wear facemasks :P
[6:06:20] kodder12: I wonder what will happen if all top streamers on twitch listen to DMCA music
[6:06:23] mojusk: yea but its nice to have the opportunity
[6:06:27] Broomba: Yep @mrgattz
[6:06:33] Crowzcut: im playing raid its better game
[6:06:34] MrGattz: i had no idea
[6:06:34] ShadoodHD: that begs the question then about whether or not twitch will get better from this
[6:06:34] Storm1854: @MrGattz yeah theres a couple wonky ways to do it like going to timeless isle swimming down to a chair and sit in it kinda crap
[6:06:37] JonnyScotland: @kodder12 they will all get banned
[6:06:41] GilianoGVK: nah man your the only one i follow in streamraiders
[6:06:42] ShadoodHD: ... which may seem like a long shot but oh well
[6:06:47] MrGattz: ohh i see
[6:06:51] GermanBacon: @kodder12 they all get banned. twitch has no choice
[6:06:56] DigitalChill: Thanks Towellie, Im addicted lol
[6:06:57] shale93: @MrGattz yes take the WoD quest from chromie, port to blasted lands and abandond the quest and just go through the portal to draenor
[6:07:14] tetrahydridodinitrogen: lol i only play on other streamers to lvl my units for towelliee battles
[6:07:14] Aervyper: @Towelliee how awesome was the football game last night?
[6:07:19] bigangry360: !battle
[6:07:19] drwoody_1337: should i go pally or hunter in shadowlands??
[6:07:20] Moobot: Play Stream Raiders with me at https://www.streamraiders.com/t/towelliee LETS OWN THE BATTLEFIELD!
[6:07:26] Grunton: rip all the music people twitch brought for the category music
[6:07:31] Broomba: @shale21 haven’t done that angle before
[6:07:38] kodder12: @GermanBacon that will be interresting, because then twitch basicly loose shit ton of income
[6:07:40] RuneMeisterKris: Yeah if people thought the DMCA email wave was savage wait until that chatroom with those poor Twitch scapegoats LUL
[6:07:41] CADZtv: some streamers still think they are safe cause they arent saving vods and clips
[6:07:41] SamboNZ: so do you have to delete all clips made by viewers? are they putting you at risk @Towelliee?
[6:07:53] CaptainTVBot: towelliee just selected a battle and the action begins in 30 minutes! Head to https://www.streamraiders.com/t/towelliee now to place your units and help earn a victory!
[6:07:59] Palbrew: @Towelliee What if we re just started streaming and not partners yet ?
[6:07:59] ShadoodHD: oh god that sounds like a lot of legal stuff to cover then
[6:08:05] GermanBacon: @kodder12 if twitch doesnt ban them, twitch gets shut down and has to pay millions in fines
[6:08:11] Tyr7: Green chests give more tokens in case you want to catch up on tier progress
[6:08:12] Storm1854: @Pallananana it doesnt matter who you are
[6:08:23] MrGattz: are you sure that that live take down is today? i swear that wasnt actually a thing yet
[6:08:25] DeanoTV: what about games with real music in them wtf???

[6:29:03] 2MakeMe: Great name
[6:29:06] RustproofSage: I lost interests in shadowland cause of the stupid decision they take, like AoE cap.. There are tons of way to prevent people to do big pulls for example you make mobs enrage when packed 5 or more.. or make them do some crazy stuff that for sure is more interesting and challenging than hard cap aoe spells
[6:29:07] cabalish: thooon

[6:32:40] Nimz83: I'm happy with my Asus ROG Swift
[6:32:45] Velashen: If you are looking to using a monitor for PS5 or Xbox wait for 2.1 HDMI 4k.
[6:32:57] Zc0n: Alienware
[6:33:00] xch4se: i really like my ASUS monitors
[6:33:00] goldiesoulo: i use benq but because i mainly FPS game
[6:33:01] blacksanta212: do you have a guide for your ui setup?
[6:33:05] Instincter: LG on amazon has really good ones

[6:33:15] JuninBeyond: LG UltraGear 144hz, 1ms, 1440p ips, bout 450 euros
[6:33:16] Drakenking: HP has that too
[6:33:16] TruVenomTv: so can you explain how rarity works will it tell me if the mob is around me?
[6:33:20] 11RYN: LG got some nice mid range G-sync compatible / freesync enabled ones
[6:33:22] goldiesoulo: blue light filter
[6:33:25] MissyKib: i need to upgrade my monitors i got onld gaming BENQ monitorsx3 that are like almost 10 years old

[6:33:30] Coldlight1: the new LG nano ips monitors are moce
[6:33:37] blacksanta212: ty @BJofBorg

[6:33:39] Coldlight1: nice***
[6:33:41] the_Bendo: You blue screen and wear gunners?
[6:33:47] gmike66: but I have no idea on a brand
[6:33:52] Klatrymadon: don't buy cheap high hz IPS monitors, most of them are really bad
[6:34:10] Klatrymadon: they often advertise low latency but the actual latencies are terrible
[6:34:11] touchofpinkfizz: @Towelliee my plater nameplates have dissapeared , im using your ui any ideas? i have had no problems before just happened now?
[6:34:15] 11RYN: @gmike66 Check out LG 27GL850

[6:34:37] Coldlight1: I have the LG 1440p Nano IPS 144hz and its pretty nice
[6:34:53] tomloy: @towelliee are you a fan of the way chromie time just kicks you at 50?
[6:34:56] vylh: or ctrl + v Keepo
[6:34:57] touchofpinkfizz: ok ty
[6:35:03] 11RYN: I have the worse one - 27GL650F, it's 1080p but I like it so far
[6:35:12] rillo5: Linus has a pretty good monitor video for 2020 if you need some quick tips @gmike66
[6:35:12] Velashen: @Antdavs24 Me as well. I can't believe more monitors don't have 2.1 yet.
[6:35:16] SubQ: nano isn't worth it imo. just go w/the 83a-b.
[6:35:31] cabalish: elvui has also an option if u start it the first time to scann for other addons conflicting, asking to use elvui or plater nameplates
[6:35:32] mrzombiebull: @Towelliee you can turn off EXP gain
[6:35:36] TheCliffyShow: Sounds stupid to me.
[6:35:47] cipusanx: gold farming maybe
[6:35:47] NovaPrime92: I hate how they think new players can't figure this stuff out when we all did when we were new
[6:35:56] Asuo_: It's so the zones reload if you're somewhere that would be lower than 50. Should just open a portal or something though
[6:35:58] Layliah79: Now rares such as TLPD are spawning in Chromie time. So if you don't have an alt in that phase you can't have a chance at it LUL
[6:36:00] xF3ARLES5x: might be an issue with gear scaling
[6:36:03] DeadlyDag: If you play wow, ultrawide is the way to go
[6:36:06] Mythdemonx: hammerman!!!!
[6:36:07] wowdad1972: What’s ur time played on this toon towel?
[6:36:16] touchofpinkfizz: @cabalish its not the ELVUI and nothing needs updating, think it could be the area as just happened to me
[6:36:20] Mirtiori: Can you go back and continue where u left off after chromie kick?
[6:36:22] tomloy: They could just say hey scaling is finished now you’re going to be op if you stay here
[6:36:23] stormingdevil007: wootowoot
[6:36:28] gmike66: thx for all the suggestions chat
[6:36:29] PoisonCatalyst: Otherwise you could probably still do bonus objectives and level 50 to 60 outside of Shadowlands
[6:36:30] itssalsashark: can WoW use multimonitors?
[6:36:34] TheFabilolz: I'm about to kill the Lich King, wish me luck @Towelliee
[6:36:35] NovaPrime92: WoW and Starcraft are amazing on ultrawide
[6:36:39] KKrugzz: i got a 34 ultrawide. i love it, but can't stream from it
[6:36:44] moonscryer: gaming on a uw is only worth it if the scenery is worth it. otherwise no
[6:36:45] aliceuwu_x: TTrump Clap
[6:36:48] flawlessfraud: gg
[6:36:48] typeonediabeast: It really doesnt make sense. I dont see a product team going "hmmm lets just force our players out of this instance in the middle of a quest without giving them a choice"
[6:36:49] JuninBeyond: 27 is great
[6:36:50] Zc0n: I run the alienware ultra wide and it's a masterpiece
[6:36:50] Ipakk: yeah wow is nice in ultrawide
[6:36:50] RuneMeisterKris: I've got the LG 34" Ultrawide. It's an experience
[6:36:54] cabalish: @clairlouise but ur good now ?
[6:36:57] MetalManGG: I mostly play singleplayer games, so ultrawide is the way to go for me
[6:36:57] purfessorplum: TCL 43" 4K tv, best wow monitor ever
[6:36:57] eyemyor: I run 2 x 32" Acers, great stuff
[6:37:05] purfessorplum: sooo much UI realestate to use
[6:37:15] DeadlyDag: @moonscryer hence wow. wow is so awesome on uw. day and night coming for a "regular" gaming-monitor.
[6:37:27] RuneMeisterKris: Having the Ultrawide makes formatting streaming a bit weird though
[6:37:28] moonscryer: yea it is
[6:37:28] TwoBrew: good morning all
[6:37:34] Bokyko: o/
[6:37:39] osatox: then you go to the zone at 50
[6:37:39] snaksy: exactly
[6:37:39] NovaPrime92: Can't you stop XP gains at 49?
[6:37:41] Storm1854: there should be an option
[6:37:43] touchofpinkfizz: @MetalManGG no doesnt seem to be working, doesnt matter ill try different area and see, maybe a bug
[6:37:44] Dreamzyi: cap xp
[6:37:47] Aaradin: you can turn xp off
[6:37:48] KingSlayerYotam: it should be a choice to go back to the city
[6:37:52] Sincline387: you can go right back to complete the quests at little or no xp
[6:37:53] CaptainTVBot: @towelliee The battle is ready to begin! 875 units were placed on the battlefield.
[6:37:55] manmower: chromie should just show up and ask you
[6:38:01] Baernern: probably to avoid low lvl gear scaling at 50
[6:38:03] rxdderz_: how do i get to shattrath? i don't have a portal in my org portal hub?
[6:38:05] BeastieeNL: !battle

[6:38:07] typeonediabeast: @NovaPrime92 You can, but its not obvious for alot of users that they have this chioce.
[6:38:08] Sincline387: you can turn off your xp at 49 and stay in it forever
[6:38:11] TheRiwen: dont care i i level in dungeon anyway
[6:38:12] Aaradin: its downstairs now
[6:38:13] touchofpinkfizz: @cabalish no doesnt seem to be , not sure why ill figure it out lol
[6:38:13] AcidSyndicate: !battle
[6:38:14] Aaradin: the portal
[6:38:17] Eekim189: If it has to kick you out, it should just move you to the main instances of the world in the same place
[6:38:19] Asuo_: Its to reload the zones if you are somewhere that wouldnt normally be 50. I see the reasoning but it should be a portal or something
[6:38:20] Xehanort1986: Batlle Ready @Towelliee
[6:38:21] brandon_tapartos: suggestion box :D
[6:38:22] mmrghost7: they nerfed conduits so hard they are becoming irrelevant
[6:38:32] Sandisy: think the leveling world is instanced. never seen a lvl 50 out and about while leveling. prevents roaming bands of 50 griefing
[6:38:34] typeonediabeast: i thought they just buffed conduits....
[6:38:37] SnAwPe: @Towelliee You can level till 51 with Timewalking
[6:38:38] manmower: they buffed some conduits, I think they are just balancing
[6:38:43] Sincline387: I think the kick out is to prevent leveling 50+ in chromie time
[6:38:44] Broomba: @rxdderz_ portal is underneath other portal room in org
[6:38:46] NovaPrime92: There was a demon hunter at 49 farming the talador alliance base on draenor and pvping and i think he had it turned off
[6:38:53] capricore: it should give you a quest to go start Shadowlands, but allow you to finish questing

[6:43:32] CADZtv: i mean it is free you getting something on top of the 6 month sub
[6:43:32] pikaisthegoat: Grats on sha drop @Towelliee
[6:43:34] mmrghost7: blizz cant pay me enough money to use that tmog LUL
[6:43:35] belaham: should of gave it to everyone that hadn't refunded there preorder
[6:43:36] Aervyper: @Towelliee i did well with my 6 month sub... got a nice mount and a FUGLY costume
[6:43:40] jmadoree: a darker theme of that mog could've been nice
[6:43:40] goldiesoulo: it might be trash but if you think about it, when will the day come when they start adding really good looking high quality tmogs ? then ppl are gonna be like wtf why isnt this in the game for free?
[6:43:42] drazial113: im about to start my Shadowlands Annual Leave from work cause i wasn't able to cancel them when Shadowlands got delayed #rip
[6:43:55] DeadlyDag: I'm still mad about the first store-mount they released. It was LIMITED. You had to be in a QUEUE to get it, buuuuut since it sold so well - they made it available for everyone, at any time.
[6:44:02] Staksor: why?
[6:44:05] mrzombiebull: @Towelliee you can turn off exp gain at 49 so you can keep going through the story of zones
[6:44:09] Mitchendo64: mounts shouldnt be in the store either
[6:44:16] goldiesoulo: yeah its too much
[6:44:18] Storm1854: tbh i dont think anything in a sub game should be sold as a microtransaction
[6:44:18] BearOfLight: to be fair, I don't think the toys should be there either
[6:44:19] typeonediabeast: Didnt they already do tmog with the helms?
[6:44:29] WeinerMcCheese: cuz they will focus on making shop tmog look 10x better than in game ones
[6:44:30] redtemplar88: If the wings were a back piece instead of shoulders I would have bought it
[6:44:30] NovaPrime92: Yeahh, the day the cosmetic shop is loaded with shit that's better looking than what's obtainable in current content will be a bad day
[6:44:32] vylh: but the "Transmoigs" tab is there now so i think its going to get worse =(
[6:44:40] Lexi__Marie: why though @Towelliee if you dont like it dont buy it let others enjoy it
[6:44:41] lekkahdh: lekkahdh subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 6 months! yay!
[6:44:41] Moobot: Thanks for subbing for 6 months, @LEKKAHDH towHAMUP
[6:44:42] soopaGreg: even pets and mounts shouldnt be there, its not f2p games
[6:44:44] Riddlz: lol they gave crayons to a kid to draw that Tmog
[6:44:45] Staksor: the only thing shouldn't be in the store is items with player power. everything else is fine
[6:44:45] Menion01: Asmond will have a mental breakdown
[6:44:49] the_Bendo: I would love more Hearthstone effects. They could take all my money.
[6:44:50] Asuo_: My fear is that these things will replace class sets and become purchase shit
[6:44:51] KyruNL: imagine if they would Aion styled wings in this game or store #DROOL
[6:44:59] 2MakeMe: No cooldown on the transmog? They fuked up the transmogifier
[6:45:01] typeonediabeast: If they drop the price more, id be ok with it. I dont see myself dropping 20$ on tmog.
[6:45:02] Mitchendo64: @Towelliee the only way to stop blizzard for continuing is to stop supporting blizzard with buying their games.
[6:45:07] nielefs: everything for money right
[6:45:09] jasperboy: yes, we saw you the first time flawless
[6:45:10] goldiesoulo: hahaha
[6:45:10] WeinerMcCheese: HE DID KEKW
[6:45:20] KickAxe12: Why does it matter if it doesn't impact player power
[6:45:21] DisquietedCollector: Can you buy just the TMOG?
[6:45:22] TheRiwen: i like the wow store
[6:45:24] Mirtiori: @soopaGreg u can buy them with gold for not so much, so it's still obtainable ez
[6:45:28] frankieloI: what other classes you like to play other than pala
[6:45:30] NovaPrime92: It's a problem really because we pay a minimum $40 box charge every 2 years and $15 a month, so i think this stuff has no place. IF WoW went free to play though, then its fine
[6:45:30] Frostfury: KEKW
[6:45:32] furytrain: You should get the witch broom from headless gorse man, instant cast

[6:45:46] mmrghost7: blizzard : COME AT ME asmon LUL
[6:45:49] mo197: Dinger
[6:45:51] Syllvn: locking it to the sub. is it any different to the blizzcon outfits?
[6:45:52] Biowolf55: i dont understand why people are mad it is just tansmog does not break the game play, but maybe that is the game now?
[6:45:54] sir_vanillin: towClap towGift towGift towGift
[6:46:01] BearOfLight: lol, the day they put gear in the store is the day the game may actually die
[6:46:10] kiidaa93: whats the fastest way of leveling? whats your record on 10-50?
[6:46:13] BearOfLight: or not, cuz people are pepple

[7:20:05] Brodih_: the Napster guy worked on Facebook right ?
[7:20:10] thebakeriscomingforu: USA has basically no laws for the age of the internet. They have just been using old laws for other industries and applying as best they can

[7:20:24] Thoreya: 5head

[7:20:33] Aquadriel: test it, is fucking fast
[7:20:37] icemanj99: Only thing that bugs me about hitting 50 is having a weapon that isn't an heirloom. Having a hard time getting an upgrade with the BFA content

[7:20:41] SimplyBarron13: northern barrens is FAST
[7:20:47] Necorian: @Towelliee & @Chat - - Cannot decide - do I main Mage or Warlock for SL. I enjoy running old content and raids and rep farms. I don't raid or PvP tbh
[7:20:49] MasterInire: Shawn Fanning was the Napster guy
[7:20:49] NovaPrime92: omg can you do that???

[7:21:08] onryokie: Stay away form some of the zones, especially Kalimdor, some still have Classic mechanics of not telling you anything or where to go. @Towelliee
[7:21:11] HaxzorJimDuggan: just stay in the forest and level killing boars
[7:21:13] Aquadriel: but you could test northshire
[7:21:18] Borlaq: Tenacious D was awesome!
[7:21:19] RuneMeisterKris: @Necorian Warlock so you can have a demon buddy. Everyone needs a buddy
[7:21:20] Storm1854: @Necorian mage is 100x better for running old content due to its arcane explosion and portals/teleporting around
[7:21:20] MissyKib: i used to do northshire abby pre squish and got 2-3 levels depending on the level range
[7:21:22] Vivelli: I thought they capped lvl at 30?
[7:21:22] HaxzorJimDuggan: tenacious d was good

[7:32:49] CADZtv: twitch also needs to change how they handle things iswell tbh like not telling anyone anything or the specific person
[7:33:01] Sollice: They have licenses on main stream stuff. It's called Amazon Music lol

[7:33:47] CADZtv: im talking about ingeneral when it comes to twitch bannings etc
[7:33:53] DecayedmiNt: @Sollice I know, but they'd have to either implement that, or seperately license for streamers. The law sure as hell isn't going to change soon. Labels won't let that happen
[7:34:01] critin87: so no music

[7:46:15] AkuTVgg: After watching both you and Lux using Plater, i’m thinking of giving it a try. I usually never play with the nameplates on enemies like that as I thought it was too screen cluttery. But with plater and the buffs/debuffs on each mob I can see the benefit.

[7:59:58] AxlTheBard: @CCNoblesse 1. Store Mounts aren't purchased by alot of people due to not wanting to support it 2. TCG and Promotions are all but, no longer in the game and basically you have to spend thousands to get it.

[8:00:25] Riddlz: LOL so by your standards you would have to collect a 1954 Hank Aaron Rookie Card when it first came out
[8:00:27] MrGattz: @DonCunha_ not really any requirements other than to be in chat and be in discord
[8:00:27] Creesy69: swift spectral is 11k on ebay atm

[8:01:19] othraerir: isnt he in the stockades now?
[8:01:23] percival1991: you technically kill him in stockades
[8:01:36] AxlTheBard: @CCNoblesse correct. But, when have you seen him going out of his way to buy one or a store mount. He has people who gifted him store mounts and he doesn't redeem

[8:39:24] Klauzzer: POGGERS
[8:39:30] Siddie: Dark iron dwarf is good for ally
[8:39:39] dylandevsstuff: @Towelliee pretty intense tbh
[8:39:42] r0ckmannn: this is gunna be something...
[8:39:42] Luxicake: towelliee is going to have a hard time reading the directions KEKW
[8:39:48] miku_mii: @Towelliee i guilt one in less then a day
[8:39:49] Sramton: How have you never played with legos before?
[8:39:54] Necorian: @Towelliee & @Chat - as a solo player who enjoys faming rep, dungeons, old raid etc. what class would you recommend?
[8:39:56] biglos67: how many thousands of pieces is that?
[8:39:57] miku_mii: @Towelliee built*
[8:39:57] b3hoffmann: is it the 7000+ pieced Millenium Falcon Build, the black series?
[8:39:58] r0ckmannn: yup...
[8:39:59] MOXP: lego? KEKW how much did they pay u

[8:40:18] dylandevsstuff: @Towelliee my brother had the star destroyer and he did this MASSIVE piece that took him an hour, and then it said, x4, so he had to do that AGAIN
[8:40:21] heffrson: that was the last mount you needed from the super rare spawns right? @Towelliee
[8:40:23] jerexify: @Deisu1 From what I understand, Tauren is the best choice for Horde, and DI Dwarf for Alliance, based on racial abilities. However, they don't make THAT much of a difference, and it's mainly in PVP, so if you don't care, or if you aren't in the top 1%, it doesn't really matter.
[8:40:28] dylandevsstuff: so yea these sets are no joke
[8:40:30] MOXP: oh that's nice POGGERS
[8:40:39] GrazzloTV: @Necorian Hunter is a good choice for ranged if you like melee warrior is pretty nice
