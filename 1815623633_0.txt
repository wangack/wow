[0:33:16] Lesud: The second way is very similar to the first, but through PvP. Each week, different Proving PvP Quests are available to the player inside of the Gladiator's Refuge in Valdrakken. These include, but are not limited to, Proving in Battle,  Proving in Skirmishes, and  Proving in Arenas. Upon completion, you will receive a  Malicia's Hoard. Just like the Scentsational Treasures, you will earn x1  Splintered Spark of Shadowflame if you have not already received one that week.

[0:49:42] Indomitablez: @Galdrena It didnt show on my end that the link was blocked or deleted. I have a twitch addon that shows me when a users message/link is blocked or deleted and the twitch clip I linked didnt get that message. Let me test a google main site link to see if it blocks that. If it doesnt Swifty may need to check his rule settings because it might be disabled accidently
[0:49:46] Indomitablez: ***

[1:03:18] shaggy462: @zennsterr for me its the classes, don't like how most of them play in retail
[1:03:46] 인터넷포트: Everyone is enjoying Dragonflight nobody is unhappy. With over 6 million players Blizzard is already working on new content for next patch thank you very much @zennsterr

[1:05:46] 인터넷포트: @shaggy462 what dont u like about the patch
[1:05:53] zennsterr: i have been playing only since legion so im still very new but i liked everything except shadowlands so far DF feels really good to me
[1:06:16] IPWolf26: 2k ping randomly love it
[1:06:20] 인터넷포트: yup and they release a new cod like a year
[1:06:27] 인터넷포트: so cod is nearly as much as wow
[1:06:36] Koenig_: Imagine classic wow for free
[1:06:40] Digmadness: Afternoon bro
[1:06:46] TTheTripMan: Dead Island 2 still 60$ <3
[1:07:07] shaggy462: @인터넷포트 It's not the patch, It's the overall design philosophy of the classes in modern wow, for example i dont like paladins having holy power, it just feels like a slow rogue to me, but others like it, so its just not for mee unfortunatley
[1:07:11] 인터넷포트: If they dropped the wow sub cost to 5.99$ a month I feel like it would bring in a few hundred thousand lower income players
[1:07:14] zennsterr: @Koenig_ ohh nostalrius.....
[1:07:42] immwrightt: is that world boss ?

[1:08:52] SisterblissUK: Nice
[1:09:10] SisterblissUK: Bat wings
[1:09:11] shaggy462: but paladin was my favorite class ;(
[1:09:41] 인터넷포트: Paladins had a great prior patch
[1:09:45] 인터넷포트: u missed out
[1:09:48] 인터넷포트: they were broken
[1:09:52] shaggy462: @인터넷포트 Don't get me wrong, i'm not saying the game is trash and really bad, i just dont think retail wow is for me anymore :(
[1:10:23] xk16_: 👍👍
[1:10:36] KhorneTortila: same @shaggy462  i can only play classic now
[1:10:59] 인터넷포트: I am sad to hear u on classic
[1:11:08] hydraponix: all the open  world stuff in retail is basically an autobattler, no reason for you to do even put inputs in just 100 people hitting a target dummy
[1:11:16] shaggy462: @인터넷포트 Yeah but i don't like the paladin play style now, i liked it back pre cataclysm
[1:11:24] 인터넷포트: I wish u can see retail for what it is at the start it may seem like a lot but they made it where its very easy to gear now and do what u want
