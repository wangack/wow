[0:43:20] Nulgar: Infinite is like, 3
[0:43:21] Sujis: Yeah infinite is when number big
[0:43:25] tyranade_: trying to comprehend infinity is a fools errand
[0:43:28] Saumur: And if you have an infinite amount of time, and you are imprisoned in literal hell, you could throw several bits in the basket and only one has to hit to get you free Kappa Oh... :(

[0:44:30] the_howlermonkey: i hav a couple of real doll Taliesens in my basement listening to cold play right now
[0:44:31] Nulgar: @skyweaver606 no, for starters the laws of physics can't be different. But there would be something similar, just without magic and stuff

[0:44:53] shawndfox: in infinite univers is possible that theres another version of our planet, but whitout prove its just theorical
[0:45:01] Saiyori: IF space were infinite, there's a room with a streamer named Taliesen where Taliesen was right Kappa
[0:45:12] Fibnkak: If you want a intresting read Look up in wikipedia "Problem of Time"
[0:45:14] cabeshpash: it's very likely there's a multiverse, so if it's not in this universe then it's probably happening in another
[0:45:17] thunduz: But that Tali would actually hate arcade units
[0:45:23] diyreality: unless there is a law of no repeats><, one of each and duplicates get deleted

[0:46:08] Andersonmps: Maybe was an another chat of the infine that didint agree with you
[0:46:12] funviking99: we can’t comprehend how complicated this is
[0:46:14] Sujis: The possibilities... Is there an infinity where we have player housing?
[0:46:19] tyranade_: that means theres also a world out there where WoW is real and we are out main characters.
[0:46:19] Sorin__: If space were infinite the sky would never be dark
[0:46:27] funviking99: LUL
[0:46:34] Sujis: BibleThump BibleThump BibleThump BibleThump
[0:46:36] Nulgar: napkin math, but a multiverse would be infinity times infinity, and that's just infinity again, that contradicts that there's a multiverse clodagHeheheh
[0:46:37] Alonarius: There are infinite numbers between 1 and 2 in decimal
[0:46:38] tyranade_: player housing. dont you mean the garrisons we can put in any zone.
[0:46:41] tyranade_: oh wait
[0:46:43] netonkent: Will there be a universe we're your not a blizzard shill 😝😝😝😝  💜💜

[0:52:18] CrossroadsDealer: Yea don't be mean to Jay, his take is also mild and silly. But still worth making fun of. How dare you say something mildly positive about Dragonflight? AD!!!!

[0:53:28] Fibnkak: @cabeshpash image needing anyone else to valadate your existance
[0:53:32] ButterStains: he called you a shill in the nicest/most passive aggressive way

[0:54:33] brennibrennt: This one broke the straw xD
[0:54:34] X_barley: You must be numb to the word shill now anyways, so any way you undercut it is just ridiculous
[0:54:39] Aleveria: His profile pic looks like a senior picture.
[0:54:39] Saiyori: Happens to the best of us Kappa
[0:54:40] Valshaw: Some people have an irrational hatred of WoW
[0:54:43] OatsMate: "This guy is taking my jerb!"
[0:54:45] ButterStains: he’s probably lurking here with us now
[0:54:47] Andersonmps: He was thinking about it for weeks
[0:54:48] tyranade_: hey blowing too early is a problem we all have once in a while
[0:54:49] Nulgar: You're probably not the only, victim of that
[0:54:55] thunduz: you're not angry, just disappointed lol
[0:55:13] Andersonmps: LMAO LUL
[0:55:16] kilmarnok1285: Putting that reply on your tweet is a bit of absurdist humor. I could why it's funny.

[0:55:58] Runzi333: Again could be that he was trying to be funny since people joke that you shill all the time but ugh
[0:56:03] cabeshpash: he must not be named
[0:56:04] Saiyori: not the moldy orange again lol
[0:56:07] X_barley: I’ll take one helping of #Ad with my milquetoast please

[0:56:25] Nulgar: Tali, would you ban me if I went and found one of his tweets to reply to with "you're supposed to put #ad behind it"? frogmu1Hehe
[0:56:25] Runzi333: I like that hahahahaha
[0:56:25] ajman1101: @taliesinandevitel hey i do t understand the big deal. obviously your tweet and internet reach is so large that when you like something is it an endorsement. take the compliment tali!! <3
[0:56:26] Azallus: That's a solid comeback though.
[0:56:27] jabbersthedog: Did he get angy
[0:56:40] X_barley: WAIT THERES MORE LMFAO
[0:56:42] IpKaiFung: Is that even his photo?
[0:56:48] Andersonmps: That was solid. If it hurts him is because its true
[0:56:57] Nulgar: @sujis what are you talking about, it's literally in the top 10!
[0:57:01] AssumptionPrime: “pays for twitter” is enough to end the conversation for me
[0:57:02] jabbersthedog: No no no. Did he get ANGY? Like angry but small and pitiful
[0:57:09] Saiyori: Uhhhh, no, you were successful during shadowlands lol
[0:57:15] Sygorian: That's literally the opposite of truth xD
[0:57:22] Saumur: And you did it anyway when WoW was at its worst LUL
[0:57:25] LilStinker: WoW content creators do markedly better when the game isn't successful
[0:57:26] O4OUR: If anything you get moe content if it's bad lol
[0:57:28] restokin: I'd have replied to him with "You're supposed to put #triggered at the end"

[0:58:15] tarnishedvalor: he'll prob make a youtube vid on how to get free advertisement by trolling
[0:58:18] bladestitch: That fact is a little sad though.
[0:58:21] tyranade_: controversy and outrage generates clicks
[0:58:23] SurgioClemente: "Forums were a shitshow" - best part of the vids.  viva sucky wow
[0:58:26] JarJar_Brinkz: You have to understand, he was originally a hooper. He didn't make the best grades, the coaches just let him get by
[0:58:35] jabbersthedog: People love to hate thing. Why do you think that shitty cgi lion king did so well?
[0:58:40] lowhet: Thanks for not trying to manipulate us tal

[0:59:22] elbardo_ts: tali, you should have let evitel say the thing

[0:59:41] bladestitch: A little salty.
[0:59:42] drunksndorks: i dont always agree, but i enjoyed that
[0:59:46] lowhet: Typical diversion tactic
[0:59:51] Azallus: I repeat the statement: He threw the gauntlet down, challenging you to throw hands, and got a fist.
[0:59:52] Saiyori: also "we are not the same" is another meme, which a guy that does MEMES for a living, should understand.
[0:59:56] Aleveria: I *think* he might like football.
[1:00:00] ButterStains: definition of a shill
[1:00:09] aces514: Oh Tali... ignore the trolls they just are not worth your time
[1:00:16] Saumur: And all the while MrGM is rubbing his hands together: This interaction-thing worked out all too nicely
[1:00:22] sterlz_the_ok: gotta love seeing the pot call the kettle black
[1:00:24] JarJar_Brinkz: Bots tbh
[1:00:27] Runzi333: Calling random content creators shills when that's your actual job
[1:00:29] Runzi333: lol
[1:00:46] sterlz_the_ok: its irony at its finest
[1:00:49] Runzi333: Hahahahahaha
[1:01:24] Runzi333: That is actually nuts like no
[1:01:26] restokin: His profile picture looks like one of those faded posters in a barbers from the 1980s
[1:01:31] Reznr: Clearly he didn't pay attention to the content from shadowlands
[1:01:31] drunksndorks: thaty
[1:01:31] cinhotlanta: LOL
[1:01:32] Saumur: He definetly didnt know the game while shadowlands was a thing LUL
[1:01:35] O4OUR: Maybe if you're paid BY Blizzard..
[1:01:36] sterlz_the_ok: In a world where rage bait doesnt exist if ONLY
[1:01:44] Arlaeya: That is the opposite of how YouTube works unfortunately
[1:01:47] diyreality: i think he has no understanding of WoW and why it stays alive , he is used to fast fashion games
[1:01:47] Nickystr1x: has he never watched a bell video?
[1:01:50] ShadowDragon14855: maybe he thinks you work for blizz
[1:01:52] ajman1101: he may not genuinely think….
[1:01:55] DiscordianKitty: been staying off of twitter and here i come to watch my good friend taliesin stream and lol it's twitter
[1:01:57] sebggg: Maybe he's formely an Optic-employee for a reason
[1:01:58] cinhotlanta: You'd get SO many more clicks by crapping on the game
[1:02:00] JarJar_Brinkz: Check if he plays Palworld
[1:02:04] SurgioClemente: The only good corpo twitter was Wendys
[1:02:04] Triskelian: Maybe he actually thinks you get paid by Blizzard for your content
[1:02:09] cabeshpash: it's impossible to tell if people on the internet are trolling or just dumb
[1:02:24] lowhet: sounds like he messed with the wrong guy tal. folks will remember what you said about him.
[1:02:27] TheDeekins: he doesn't know you're in the Blizz Doghouse
[1:02:34] JarJar_Brinkz: @cabeshpash Well this guy is dumb, but he thinks he's trolling
[1:02:34] Runzi333: Hahaha "squeal on camera over walrus transmog" Oh so he just doesn't understand actual joy
[1:02:40] Saumur: The devs already stated once, that Taliesin is true is canon, so there its only going down from there Kappa

[1:06:42] bladestitch: Why didn't he ask you to cure all cancer while he was at it...
[1:06:48] LilStinker: You also have a wife and kids, why would you give away your families income for a month
[1:06:50] JimothyOnline: I can just envision the veins popping out of his forehead every time you reply
[1:06:51] Nulgar: to literally feed your children
[1:06:53] sterlz_the_ok: One has a family and kids, the other likes getting mad at content creators
[1:06:53] Midgens_: do you guys pay for daycare?
[1:06:54] Fibnkak: kids and a wife arn't hourly like the people he hires
[1:06:54] Benzagha: how else are you going to pay the builders?!

[1:07:32] Andersonmps: LMAO LUL
[1:07:34] cosmopanda13: imagine quickly explaining to your children why they have to go hungry for a month over a bet with a guy on the internet
[1:07:41] tyranade_: liking your own tweet is basically giving yourself a reach-around
[1:07:42] 1NessaToday: The way he is talking about squarespace is telling me he is really a fan who probably watches you rn
[1:07:46] meanbeanesz: no more drops progress bar showing up ???
[1:07:46] cabeshpash: that's exactly what he's doing
[1:07:51] goqu3D: Honestly if I had to make memes for a living regardless of pay I'd probably off myself
[1:07:52] cabeshpash: he's just trolling for attention
[1:07:57] Lukyth1rt3en: he says he makes memes while making fun of your tuskar xmog meme lol

[1:08:39] tarnishedvalor: this is why i don't use twitter lol
[1:08:40] CrossroadsDealer: prove it's not about money by not making money!!!!!!!
[1:08:54] Saumur: Strawman argument, isnt that the term?
[1:09:02] bladestitch: Sounds a little like Russell's teapot.

[1:10:26] reddenedone: He buy those follower accounts?

[1:12:03] alextheblight: I don't get it, by the way
[1:12:04] Saumur: If that is the best he can do... Im rather disappointed

[1:12:39] Ealdfox: "Hush Tyrande! I'm so funny!" tneKhadgarWut
[1:12:43] beohoof: Once you say he was based in Miami you should have realized you were dealing with an overly self indulgent tool
[1:12:44] cinhotlanta: That meme is Sh........
[1:12:55] Sygorian: OWNED WITH ELF

[1:29:50] jiveyivey: @Hotstitute As someone from Florida, can confirm ampers4ItsREAL
[1:30:12] aerythlea: *former* professional digital marketer Kappa
[1:30:21] Vindicyte_: The fact that hes a professional at making memes just gives him no claim at all
[1:30:31] Andersonmps: And the youtuber said your game is GOOD!
[1:30:35] LatroTLI: probably the opposite
[1:30:45] Sorin__: you're also british, it's part of your culture
[1:30:49] Teth33: I don't think he understands that you don't depend on a check from Blizz, but he might someday. Even with squarespace you can get another sponsor.
[1:30:50] Aleveria: ummm his linked in pic is totally different. Like he's a cowboy there.
[1:30:52] Nerzalus: calling someone a cunt, is like saying the grass is fuckin green
[1:30:54] Harai_Ulfsark: and there are a thousand people watching this LUL
[1:31:03] Hotstitute: For a digital marketer, he doesnt seem to understand that some one with more of a viewership isnt some one you trash talk, his choice is weird
[1:31:06] Azallus: That's probably the source of his anger though, Tali. He believes himself superior, that his work is more relevant. Most likely a "How dare a YouTuber express his opinon compared to me, a digital marketer!"
[1:31:07] sterlz_the_ok: Oh, Jay, the guy we pay is talking shit about our franchises? Cool
[1:31:14] KyleS07: Asmon literally became so popular by saying controversial and negative things about WoW and other stuff.
[1:31:27] Vaephera: I'm not even sure he understands what a meme is
[1:31:34] imthabeast: What is it even supposed to mean? maybe I just don't get lore
[1:31:35] Tenga66: It's just standard twitter elonbrainrot playbook
[1:31:36] aeson_of_raid_sock: Wow: *opens twitter*           wow: yeah that guys a cunt
[1:31:37] chief_hakoda_91: His Tik Tok is pretty special too. It makes him look like he doesn't have any friends. Sadge
[1:31:51] TownieTV: he should have a chat with HeelsvsBabyface about how good things makes more money
[1:31:54] StandardizedGenie: and your mouth
[1:31:56] lowhet: It appears he runs e-sports leagues for young boys.
[1:32:09] JimothyOnline: Jay's the type of guy that only a mother could love
[1:32:11] Fibnkak: DO you think Jay was a Wowkiller fan?
[1:32:19] Aleveria: I think we need to get the Catfish people to check him out. He's sus.
[1:32:28] KyleS07: people like him are why I left Twitter.
[1:32:28] OceaneSarai: your mouth isnt even ugly, you're not ugly at all
[1:32:29] GoldSmog: I doubt it
[1:32:34] Nerzalus: I'm a flatout cunt :D
[1:32:37] Teth33: I think you have a pretty mouth ***Deliverance music intensifies****
[1:32:40] suzyq1503: "nice guy"
[1:32:46] lowhet: Okay tal
[1:32:53] StandardizedGenie: his twitter is boring anyway
[1:32:54] alextheblight: I just blocked him
[1:33:00] lowhet: we'll smack if you want\
[1:33:02] kelsos86: I also blocked him :)
[1:33:02] alextheblight: bamo, mate
[1:33:04] Bubblecrisp: yeah just blocked him and moved on
[1:33:07] Noznatation: sure but I did go and put him on ignore because I didn't want to randomly see a shitty meme he made again :D
[1:33:10] TheDeekins: I haven't banned anyone in a while trikS
[1:33:15] GoldSmog: *wink*
[1:33:17] GoldSmog: j/k
[1:33:18] Fibnkak: But what if i were to findmyself suddenly working with the guy?  can i say it in person?
[1:33:19] chief_hakoda_91: but his Mum!
[1:33:20] sterlz_the_ok: Not worth continuing finished roasts, the meat would get burnt
[1:33:21] aeson_of_raid_sock: you should make a book of his best memes
[1:33:32] kelsos86: he can do that on his own
[1:33:36] beohoof: He's a digital marketing memelord from Miami. He's not a nice person
[1:33:38] MavisSiobhan: going to be a short book
[1:33:40] Saumur: I mean: He's pretty good at ruining his career on his own Kappa
[1:33:49] Hotstitute: he makes memes for a living... what career?
[1:33:53] CompSciJedi: No need to try and ruin his career. He'll do a good enough job of that himself
[1:33:59] edd_3000: Please don't ban my ugly mouth
[1:34:04] lowhet: hahaha
[1:34:06] Teth33: He has hurt his career more himself than anyone here could.
[1:34:07] Musihus: you can ban me from twitter O_O
[1:34:09] imthabeast: Wait you're blacklisted by blizzard? I haven't kept up with you in a while. how'd that happen? I thought blizzard loved you and Evitel

[1:34:16] aeson_of_raid_sock: Florida man comments on other man’s mouth on twitter
[1:34:22] Sharkos21: i may have an ugly mouth but at least it matches my ugly face and body
[1:34:23] Nekdoo: how long is our boy going on this rant ?
[1:34:26] Hotstitute: can we get a link to his twitter so we can "block" him?
[1:34:32] OceaneSarai: i still can't believe he went for the tuskarr like that
[1:34:40] Dean_Metal: i will say this... the dude looks weird. i wouldn't ask him to babysit the kids if you know what im saying.
[1:34:45] serixis: !drops
[1:34:46] Nulgar: Did John change his name?
[1:34:50] DragnosiOfNede: OK, Honest question.  I called someone a Twat here once and it kind of upset you.  But calling someone a cunt doesn't.  I think I need to understand the slang of the UK a lot better because I don't understand the difference! :)
[1:34:51] FlaminJurr: 3 months til the 5 year mouth sub badge Kappa
[1:34:58] AnsoniaTV: AnsoniaTV subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 3 months, currently on a 1 month streak!

[1:37:59] BeerGeekBones: Has anyone finished the Outland Cup yet?
[1:38:07] Fibnkak: I wish i had a founders tag
[1:38:12] skewlbeta: @BeerGeekBones yes on day 1
[1:38:20] Sorin__: I feel like they might not give you the word cunt
[1:38:24] Hotstitute: whole tweet or nothing
[1:38:29] nathan_melton: Can I get a TLDR of this drama we're going over??
[1:38:30] JarJar_Brinkz: He's great at his job

[1:39:16] Harai_Ulfsark: meanwhile MrGM engagement like 📈
[1:39:21] Nekdoo: Hi guys :)   Did he already talked about Wow stuff and will just going on this twitter stuff ?

[1:39:37] aeson_of_raid_sock: MrGM diabolical
[1:39:40] Sharkos21: 2.6 twitter cents
[1:39:48] BeerGeekBones: I legit use Canva to like remove backgrounds around my characters and do like scenes with all my characters in the same picture together. My pre-warband...warband
[1:39:52] edd_3000: I feel like we need to know what MrGM thinks of your mouth. Let's get to the bottom of this
[1:39:57] Andersonmps: It was an MrGM evil plan al along
[1:39:59] Noznatation: WHAT - WHAT ABOUT THE PEOPLE WHO DROWNED TALI!
[1:40:00] TownieTV: 100% of people who ingest water eventually die

[1:40:16] cosmopanda13: finally someone came out and said it thank you!
[1:40:23] Fibnkak: Is Jay a made up person by MrGM to get interactions
[1:40:26] drago101119: what about when the sky is kinda pink or red?
[1:40:26] edd_3000: How do we go from rating Dragonflight to rating Tali's mouth
[1:40:26] CompSciJedi: Blue skies? In the UK?
[1:40:31] Andersonmps: Ty. made all of us laught
[1:40:32] GyratingDog: Honestly, water has more flavor than playing a BM hunter
[1:40:35] databob1: it was really funny
[1:40:36] CeasiusPls: the greatest of calamities are brought upon by MRGM's tweets
[1:40:37] GyratingDog: <3
[1:40:40] gryffiest: working for big water I see
[1:40:43] Sorin__: well he was already here
[1:40:45] Mosquithor: Dragonflight was definately one of the expansions of wow
[1:40:54] Hotstitute: gonna submit directly to Elon
[1:40:58] Azallus: He already has seen it. He was here moments ago as xaxaxas, remember?
[1:40:58] Andersonmps: LUL
[1:41:02] Nerzalus: He'll have a phone full of mouth pics if he finds this vid
[1:41:02] CrossroadsDealer: Tali talked about me! Hate Speech!
[1:41:04] Midgens_: I had an ex bf send my mom an email once
[1:41:06] kikisume: LUL LUL LUL
[1:41:07] edd_3000: I hope MrGM isn't going to sit on the fence regarding tali's mouth
[1:41:09] JimothyOnline: Love you mate <3
[1:41:12] edd_3000: Tell us how you really feel
[1:41:17] bellzzar1: hey tali
[1:41:19] Aleveria: @Nerzalus Weirdest fetish ever.
[1:41:20] Midgens_: it really was lol
[1:41:21] bladestitch: They nerfed a dungeon.
[1:41:22] MeggoArt: when do you think we'll hear about PIRATES? what do your content creator ears hear
[1:41:23] aeson_of_raid_sock: 10.2.6?
[1:41:24] BeerGeekBones: Pirate stuff went on Encrypted Vendor build, so that will be on PTR soon. Thats some good news

[1:41:39] edd_3000: Hahahaha
[1:41:51] Aleveria: LUL LUL LUL
[1:41:52] diyreality: how was that tweet even on the radar of the meme master
[1:41:54] xaxxas_: @Azallus Perverting the Truth is no joke. We all have a responsibility to be the perfect role models and that's a sure way to betray that duty.
[1:42:04] GameingAspect: its wensday wut
[1:42:12] Nulgar: Tali, you're in the Top 2 of streamers in this household
[1:42:34] Sharkos21: the edge of this meme has cut me
[1:42:37] Hotstitute: i hated that show
[1:42:41] Fro_J_Simpson: They nerfed the Manuscript from the Outland Cup when they converted it into the Vial of Endless Scales toy. It now has an hour cooldown and expires on death instead of staying on as a toggled option, so if you die just after putting it on, too darn bad.
[1:42:41] bellzzar1: i hope 10.2.6 is tuskarr and the pirate flag is just to troll you
[1:42:49] Nekdoo: what do you think of player housing, once they have finish the revamp of all the majorCities ?
[1:42:52] DHStom: I saw this meme today, except it was 2024/January.
[1:42:57] Nickystr1x: @nulgar idk Ani’s stream is on the come up
[1:42:59] Hotstitute: Pirate stuff for trading post, and its a jinyu/hozen
[1:43:20] Fibnkak: Can the pirate be a Tuskarr all along
[1:43:33] Hotstitute: its on jay's twitter
[1:43:33] Nulgar: @Nickystr1x technically, Ani is just guest-starring for now. But once he streams on his own, it's over for Tali
[1:43:36] skewlbeta: The set recolor is very nice. I'm looking forward to a blue one for Northrend, etc.
[1:43:45] Fibnkak: It's a toy
[1:43:45] Azallus: @xaxxas_ Lol? I'm clearly just joking around, but you're almost making it seems like I'm right. Either way, let's enjoy the rest of the stream shall we :D
[1:43:49] JarJar_Brinkz: LMAO
[1:43:54] Aleveria: We should all be "perfect role models"? Why? To whom? I'm not a role model to anyone, and I prefer it that way.
[1:43:59] JarJar_Brinkz: Mr Hair's twitter
[1:44:00] shawndfox: @TaliesinAndEvitel the manuscript is active from the dragoriding abilities or used to be last week
[1:44:02] BeerGeekBones: I do wonder if Player Housing is coming. Especially since Reclamation of Gilneas stuff had a bunch of doors that you could open in Gilneas, but nothing but empty rooms in there. So maybe that means player housing to Gilneas soon?
[1:44:02] Fro_J_Simpson: The toggle for the manuscript used to be in the Spellbook under Dragonriding
[1:44:06] skewlbeta: @TaliesinAndEvitel it is in the spellbook
[1:44:17] Nekdoo: spellbook, no toy
[1:44:21] Nickystr1x: @nulgar Oh that’s right sorry you’re stuck in normal time, I’m in advanced time where we can have 9month subs in 3 months
[1:44:21] timothygamechair: !Drops
[1:44:24] MavisSiobhan: Tali is so confused
[1:44:27] helheimr: I dont understand why they dont use the UI for the dragonriding glyphs to put a buttom there that does the job
[1:44:30] Azallus: He's arguing with me, @Tali, because I was joking he was Jay.
[1:44:31] xaxxas_: I should be allowed to defend myself from misinfo.
[1:44:32] JarJar_Brinkz: Check his youtube
[1:44:35] Trebled_Mind: tneTrundleMaldini tneTrundleMaldini tneTrundleMaldini
[1:44:39] Fibnkak: don't click jay youtube
[1:44:44] quenvin: Great looking Drake!
[1:44:45] FlaminJurr: KEKW
[1:44:49] gryffiest: lol
[1:44:49] Azallus: That's what I'm saying too!
[1:44:52] Sharkos21: the evidence is too strong
[1:44:53] JarJar_Brinkz: Only Jay Hairston would suggest someone look at his youtube channel
[1:44:54] banshee_bree: real Jay behavior
[1:45:01] GyratingDog: arent we all jay?
[1:45:04] LilStinker: moon2NOO he won't check my you tube

[1:45:17] Trebled_Mind: tneTrundleMaldini tneTrundleMaldini tneTrundleMaldini
[1:45:18] bottis96: Don't be a Jay
[1:45:19] Hotstitute: shut up jay
[1:45:20] cosmopanda13: Imagine Jay being so offended about being Jay
[1:45:21] Sharkos21: i mean in his defense i wouldnt want to be called jay either lmfao
[1:45:22] KaydenGrey: omg so cool we have jay here
[1:45:25] Nerzalus: Can I be Jay? He's so cool
[1:45:26] sterlz_the_ok: Jay still yapping?
[1:45:36] Noznatation: He has been here for over half a year - ofc. he is joking :D
[1:45:37] Fro_J_Simpson: idk if the manuscript has reset on the EU realms but the toggle is in the Spellbook under Dragonriding
[1:45:37] Aleveria: From now on, I'll refer to "marketers" and "memers" as Jay.
[1:45:39] Andersonmps: I think he is serious LUL
[1:45:39] Ealdfox: We're all Jays
[1:45:45] aurum2509: what if I was jay all along?
[1:45:50] shawndfox: manuscript spellbook
[1:45:54] ButterStains: we all have a Jay in our hearts
[1:45:55] sterlz_the_ok: Youve got a game to shill for Talie!
[1:46:00] antunes43: why no controversy? we love some controversy
[1:46:01] Azallus: Sorry, Tali, didn't mean to bring the Jay stuff back by messin' with the dude ^_^
[1:46:03] N1IGHTRAV3N: vendor near you
[1:46:05] Hotstitute: manuscript?
[1:46:09] gryffiest: in all of us are two Jays
[1:46:12] NinjaKazz: [Vial of Endless Draconic Scales]
[1:46:13] Hotstitute: its on the vendor infront of you
[1:46:15] Nerzalus: vendor is right there
[1:46:16] Fibnkak: Or am i thinking it's a spell
[1:46:17] Fro_J_Simpson: vial of endless draconic scales
[1:46:25] Aleveria: Jay is the endboss of the next raid.
[1:46:25] Mosquithor: Is it in the spellbook?
[1:46:25] bladestitch: Can't find mine either.
[1:46:26] Fibnkak: It might be in the spell book
[1:46:29] AlanC2024: same i brought it?
[1:46:29] Nulgar: @xaxxas_ Twitch is not for kids, so there's no obligation at all to be role models
[1:46:29] Fro_J_Simpson: or check the spellbook under Dragonriding
[1:46:31] soveringxx: Vial of endless draconic scales
[1:46:36] skewlbeta: naww I'd wait.
[1:46:38] Andersonmps: Daamn
[1:46:39] Sorin__: that's how they get you
[1:46:39] skewlbeta: that seems a bit silly
[1:46:40] bslarkin: Yep, says Toy.
[1:46:41] helheimr: you dont, they said on the forums its currently bugged
[1:46:42] Nulgar: check your mail?
[1:46:43] sijil82: There's a bug where you're not getting it if you bought the manuscript, don't buy it again
[1:46:53] RosieSeren: I think if you already bought it you have to wait
[1:46:56] avatarlord: did they refund original?
[1:46:57] NinjaKazz: look in your Toybox on the char you got it on
[1:46:58] databob1: it should be a toy in your book if you bought it
[1:47:00] soveringxx: Didn't make me buy it again 🤔
[1:47:01] Fro_J_Simpson: It used to be on the end next to Second Wind
[1:47:03] ShipWight: bluepost said some bug, they'd roll out a fix asap
[1:47:05] aurum2509: that’s weird I have mine as a toy without having to buy it again
[1:47:11] bladestitch: I also bought but can't find it as toy or spell either.
[1:47:19] butlerlog: maybe you own the toy on a character but didn't right click to learn it yet?
[1:47:23] Nerzalus: is it in your bag?
[1:47:27] Nulgar: different name?
[1:47:28] drago101119: I think toggle from the manuscript is on the customization window
[1:47:34] DiscordianKitty: are you on the character you bought it on?
[1:47:39] Kazarack_Azalea: Yeah is it not in your bag or your mailbox
[1:47:49] Hotstitute: TICKET!
[1:47:50] bottis96: mailbox?
[1:47:51] databob1: hmmm not sure then
[1:47:51] bslarkin: Double check your exclusions - show things you don't have
[1:47:59] butlerlog: maybe they took your toy away as part of cancelling you
[1:48:01] RosieSeren: I'm in the same boat, but no refund on badges
[1:48:08] alextheblight: but Northrend race D:
[1:48:08] Emzy255: Mine is missing too and I didnt get refunded
[1:48:12] Andersonmps: 1h cd
[1:48:14] sterlz_the_ok: No refund
[1:48:22] BeerGeekBones: Fun police
[1:48:26] imthabeast: someone said there was a bluepost about a bug
[1:48:27] MrScotticus: Because they hate joy :(
[1:48:27] Mosquithor: How long does it last? Since its 1hr cd?
[1:48:28] Alex_Darkly: Who makes these cooldowns
[1:48:29] Noznatation: can you use it while mounted maybe?
[1:48:30] Nulgar: probably easier than teaching the spell account-wide
[1:48:31] bladestitch: Annoying since we didn't get som ingame info. I wouldnt have known if I hadnt watch this stream.
[1:48:32] sterlz_the_ok: It was bound to character not account for some reason?
[1:48:33] shawndfox: it doesnt make any sense
[1:48:36] Fro_J_Simpson: It was because people were complaining that the aura wasn't account-bound in the original Manuscript implementation
[1:48:37] Noznatation: Cause then the cd could be realted to that
[1:48:39] drago101119: I guess people asked for it to be a toy instead but not sure who asked. they said fans asked for it
[1:48:41] SurgioClemente: can you show toy's effect?
[1:48:44] Nulgar: then again, there's the Dragon Glyphs, they're account-wide and teach spells
[1:48:48] databob1: it was to make it account wide put they did a bad job of it
[1:49:08] Noznatation: not the cd though - can u use it while mounted?
[1:49:09] helheimr: but the glyphs are account bound, i dont understand why they dont use the same UI
[1:49:09] NinjaKazz: They culd have made it a dagon talent
[1:49:12] Andersonmps: The 1h cd is still not good
[1:49:14] drago101119: aren't all the manuscripts account bound?
[1:49:17] AlanC2024: but the other manuscripts are account bound for looks and not a toy
[1:49:22] skewlbeta: @TaliesinAndEvitel do you think we will get a PTR for 10.2.6 or will it be a total secret?
[1:49:24] sterlz_the_ok: lolol
[1:49:25] RosieSeren: post says "Any character who has the Manuscript of Endless Possibilities purchased before our change will automatically be given the toy! " Not true for me!
[1:49:31] cinhotlanta: yeah dragon talent would have been a better fix
[1:49:33] placeholdername33: It's cause blizzard saw the tweet Jay tagged them on and took the manuscript away
[1:49:36] DiscordianKitty: other abilities are account bound as well
[1:49:46] bladestitch: Not me either.
[1:49:47] clemdawwwg: Did you check your mail?
[1:49:51] drago101119: I didn't get the toy but bought the manuscrip
[1:49:59] kikisume: LUL LUL
[1:50:05] MrAxeffect: buy 2 games
[1:50:05] cinhotlanta: lol
[1:50:12] soveringxx: Me
[1:50:12] shawndfox: manuscript turned toy
[1:50:12] NinjaKazz: o/

[1:50:14] drago101119: me

[1:50:17] Nerzalus: I've got 3 years sub... I'm ready
[1:50:17] databob1: me'

[1:50:18] aurum2509: yes
[1:50:20] Kshantos: i get myself something from subway
[1:50:20] Harai_Ulfsark: guess it wasnt a true manuscript, but just a spell you enabled on your spellbook (previously)
[1:50:20] witchhobbit: yeah i got it
[1:50:21] aurum2509: I did
[1:50:21] shawndfox: i had it i got the toy
[1:50:27] Fro_J_Simpson: It blows my mind that they didn't just put it on the dragonriding tab somewhere on the glyph tree. You know, the first place people would think to look.
[1:50:27] NinjaKazz: xD
[1:50:28] apixelops: I did
[1:50:30] DiscordianKitty: what's the toy called?
[1:50:31] Tenga66: had it, didn't get it
[1:50:33] MavisSiobhan: New merch from T&E
[1:50:34] drago101119: I don't have the toy but bought the manuscript
[1:50:36] butlerlog: might be time to make a ticket and get the currency back in 6 weeks when they check it
[1:50:36] Zchives: it turned into the toy after the reset
[1:50:40] sterlz_the_ok: Vial of Endless Draconic Scales
[1:50:41] Ealdfox: #ad is the new punctuation
[1:50:43] Arlaeya: yeah I have it
[1:50:58] cinhotlanta: WoW is great - MONEY PLEASE ;)
[1:50:59] Fibnkak: i'll let you know after  i get home and check @ad
[1:51:07] Rico_Azzarash: YES!
[1:51:09] butlerlog: probably not tbh
[1:51:10] NinjaKazz: hell yea xD
[1:51:10] Andersonmps: For sure
[1:51:15] Arlaeya: Yes and would totally wear it to Blizzcon next year
[1:51:17] MavisSiobhan: . .I'd buy #Ad. :p
[1:51:17] clemdawwwg: I am not proud to say this... But... YES.
[1:51:18] Rico_Azzarash: DO IT!
[1:51:20] KyleS07: with #ad on it. yes.
[1:51:21] MichaelXIII: Nope
[1:51:21] drizzeh33: yup
[1:51:22] KaydenGrey: would depend on the cost :P
[1:51:27] MeggoArt: framed print
[1:51:27] avatarlord: hell yeah #ad
[1:51:28] bladestitch: My friends would think I've gone over the deep end.
[1:51:29] MavisSiobhan: . . I'd buy #Ad
[1:51:31] databob1: mabye but Id rather have it on a hat
[1:51:32] bigoldmeatpie: give me that on a displate
[1:51:34] drago101119: I work with kids so I can't buy that lol
[1:51:34] Arlaeya: lol!
[1:51:35] Phenroi: Is that Pedro Pascal's mouth? Absolutely if that's the case ;P
[1:51:35] Noznatation: if u add ther #add then sure
[1:51:35] Ryall_: wear that to school pickup
[1:51:37] MichaelXIII: #ad
[1:51:38] DiscordianKitty: what's the toy calllled
[1:51:39] chief_hakoda_91: Just wanted to say, thanks for making my birthday day stream a banger. It's been good laughs
[1:51:42] Mosquithor: Who's Jay, what lore am I missing?
[1:51:46] MavisSiobhan: lol
[1:51:50] Rico_Azzarash: Should we now always speak like this? #ad
[1:51:51] Andersonmps: Or a mug, maybe
[1:51:54] Harai_Ulfsark: endless scales
[1:51:54] Nerzalus: frame the entire post as a slideshow on the shirt
[1:51:55] DiscordianKitty: oh yeah I have it
[1:52:03] BeerGeekBones: #ad is the new #WhatSword
[1:52:06] aeson_of_raid_sock: Covid masks maybe
[1:52:16] DiscordianKitty: my shilling is paying off
[1:52:17] butlerlog: is the buff permanent until toggled off?
[1:52:22] KyleEverett: how long does the aura last?
[1:52:25] voidmuse: wordbubble above it "naw, it was a shitshow"
[1:52:27] Phenroi: Gimme that Tali mouth near me, I want that
[1:52:36] clemdawwwg: To be fair... great for a black mug.
[1:52:40] Fro_J_Simpson: It used to be permanent, sadly.
[1:52:40] DiscordianKitty: A buff you have to keep reapplying lmao why
[1:52:43] KyleEverett: at least it has 100% uptime unlike most toys
[1:52:50] shawndfox: now what happens if you die?
[1:53:03] MrScotticus: I don't understand why it would have a cooldown at all
[1:53:05] shawndfox: does death reset the cd?
[1:53:05] Sharkos21: don't die #ad
[1:53:07] Nerzalus: It's okay, I never die
[1:53:09] Noznatation: It is for science!
[1:53:10] LilyOfTremere: Does it only use stuff that you have unlocked?
[1:53:11] soveringxx: I kept it permanent from the toggle lol
[1:53:14] Mosquithor: o7
[1:53:15] Fibnkak: bubble
[1:53:20] onathehunter: wait if I bought the item how do I learn the toy?
[1:53:23] avatarlord: for science #ad
[1:53:27] bellzzar1: i'm huffing the copium that 10.2.6 is tuskarr allied race and the pirate flag is just to troll you because you said next exp was pirates
[1:53:28] Andersonmps: Its gone
[1:53:28] KyleEverett: rip
[1:53:29] bordum: is anyone elses gear having random mogs changes after leaving pvp?
[1:53:30] Noznatation: so wierd
[1:53:30] DiscordianKitty: I wonder why they couldn't just  make the ability account wide
[1:53:31] Alex_Darkly: oof
[1:53:32] Mosquithor: -1hr
[1:53:36] databob1: I like the randomization sometimes but that's just my preference
[1:53:39] butlerlog: and now its got an hour cd, thats odd?
[1:53:51] Noznatation: It is fine - but why the 1h cd though
[1:53:53] alextheblight: yep
[1:53:53] butlerlog: its not a big deal, but toys all have weird CDs
[1:53:55] DiscordianKitty: i'm still happy for my alts
[1:53:55] shawndfox: whats the toy CD now
[1:54:01] Nulgar: @bellzzar1 HE SAID CONQUISTADORS #AD
[1:54:08] cosmopanda13: tweet that for the engagement
[1:54:10] Alex_Darkly: @butlerlog Toy CDs never made sense
[1:54:19] Andersonmps: Did the cd reseted?
[1:54:29] BeerGeekBones: Is it just me, or does anyone else wish they could do Dragonriding Races on their Dracthyr now that Dracthyr can Dragonride during Soar
[1:54:35] allissashin: isnt it consistent? no ful allowed
[1:54:37] Nerzalus: giving it the cd is worse than making it a toy
[1:54:38] Fibnkak: I can't wait for the Draenor  races
[1:54:38] bellzzar1: @Nulgar oh yeah thats right xD
[1:54:39] DiscordianKitty: so strange
[1:54:43] shawndfox: off what a downgrade
[1:54:47] BeerGeekBones: It just seems odd for my Dracthyr to ride a dragon to do dragonracing
[1:54:50] Mosquithor: Why have a CD at all?
[1:54:51] Nulgar: @Andersonmps would be weird if it had a long CD, and only reset on death
[1:55:14] GyratingDog: bro i wanna do dragon riding races on a male pandaren
[1:55:20] Noznatation: same with the bird
[1:55:20] NinjaKazz: its okay.. we are not going to use the dragons in the next expansien anyway xD
[1:55:27] Nulgar: also, landing cancels Soar, so that would brick your attempt no matter what
[1:55:52] shawndfox: hold on a second how do you manage to get the vigor bar down there?
[1:55:53] Davos234: yeah, but how difficult would it be to change dracthyr for races only?
[1:55:53] Andersonmps: @Andersonmps I agree, but the power stones work like this. Or im i wrong?
[1:55:55] JarJar_Brinkz: I will be
[1:56:06] Saevash: dragons > all other mounts
[1:56:07] NinjaKazz: i miss my syyscreamer
[1:56:08] Saumur: Say that when you get your flying Tuskarr Kappa
[1:56:09] bordum: is that mount a guaranteed drop?
[1:56:10] Fibnkak: have a feat of strg that is soar looser  when you try to use soar for a race
[1:56:13] GoldSmog: My god I just called someone Jay in a work email
[1:56:13] GameingAspect: dynmatic fflying
[1:56:14] drago101119: personally prefer my nether drake over any other mount
[1:56:17] Andersonmps: Soar has a cast time too. Thats no good for the race
[1:56:21] Mosquithor: Just use Heavenly Onyx Cloud Serpent, best mount
[1:56:23] aeson_of_raid_sock: I can’t wait to use something undead for dynamic flying #ad
[1:56:25] cosmopanda13: I'm a dwarf so it's gryphons all the way for me
[1:56:28] cinhotlanta: Me... and my draaaaaaaaaaagon
[1:56:30] avatarlord: unless I magically get invincible, dragons all the way
[1:56:38] Andersonmps: The fire owl  too
[1:56:39] bladestitch: Do you think we'll get more customization for our dragons in the next exp?
[1:56:39] JoeTheRedcoat: I play a blood elf so I'd probably be using a dragonhawk
[1:56:43] Saiyori: Iwant to see it on the BEE
[1:56:44] Midgens_: I cant wait. I am so tired of the clunky giant dragon mounts.
[1:56:46] Fibnkak: Haven't seen zero Mechanicaleither
[1:56:48] jiveyivey: Curious what it looks like on Horses - like invincible
[1:56:51] aeson_of_raid_sock: did you get remaster yet? #ad
[1:56:52] voidmuse: waiting for druid forms!
[1:56:56] bigoldmeatpie: the barrel roll on the pig omg
[1:57:04] Andersonmps: Looks good on the fire Owl too
[1:57:05] aeson_of_raid_sock: loremaster *
[1:57:08] BeerGeekBones: I wonder if Hivemind speed boost will apply to Dragonriding if that becomes a Dynamic Flying mount. That, or will it have its own special effects and abilities the same the Gryphon Stormrider has its own static charge ability.
[1:57:08] JMan31337: dragon riding on the sewer cover mounts lol
[1:57:12] thomaslb95: thomaslb95 subscribed with Prime. 
[1:57:22] Dashric: need mechanicals mounts from mechagon in dragonriding
[1:57:27] Fibnkak: I am gonna use my eng rockets
[1:57:30] Harai_Ulfsark: magic carpets LUL
[1:57:33] Saumur: The carpets
[1:57:34] cinhotlanta: Does the pig have dynamic????
[1:57:41] Lauriegami: cloud serpents?
[1:57:42] Andersonmps: Cartel Dist
[1:57:42] MeggoArt: nzoth worms better be as silly as i want them to be
[1:57:42] JoeTheRedcoat: Broomstick
[1:57:46] KeyouiX: like the pally class mount
[1:57:47] Harai_Ulfsark: hogrus?
[1:57:48] KyleS07: the pally charger.
[1:57:49] Davos234: Davos234 subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 15 months! can't wait for my mech mount to flap its arms
[1:57:50] jiveyivey: Panderan Kite?
[1:57:50] Andersonmps: Cartel disc*
[1:57:52] proffknight: i cant wait for my flying carpet to get dynamic riding
[1:57:55] derry10: have we got any confirmation on if each new type of mount is going to have a gimmic, like the griffion's whirrling surge doesn't function the same way as the it does on dragons
[1:57:55] kevmauldin: the cradle thing from ardenweald
[1:57:59] lewis_dub: I assumed it was only on mounts that had wings and could be animated! Thats cool to know someone is working on that!
[1:58:01] kahdia_: but didn't they say not all flying mounts would be able to dragonride?
[1:58:03] bladestitch: Invincible.
[1:58:03] GameingAspect: mimrons head
[1:58:06] str4ysheep: i want to see it on a mechanical mount. we also get one from delves, so i hope it's good
[1:58:09] KyleS07: the Kirin
[1:58:09] Andersonmps: Sinrunner Blanchy
[1:58:10] Nulgar: Headless Horseman's Mount
[1:58:12] TheDeekins: TheDeekins subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 58 months, currently on a 58 month streak! DYNAMIC FLYING on my DARKMOON DIRIGIBLE is my DREAM realbamLORD
[1:58:29] kahdia_: Like how will that shadowlands shell be able to dragonride
[1:58:30] JMan31337: wonder will it get rid of the bobbing on the pandarian dragons
[1:58:31] BeerGeekBones: Crab mount flying sideways. #ad
[1:58:34] cinhotlanta: There will hopefully eventually be a whole taletn track for mechanical mounts
[1:58:40] JimothyOnline: It'll have to fart fire or something
[1:58:44] voidmuse: Old Blanchy will be cool
[1:58:44] Fibnkak: every eng mount is gonna look awesome
[1:58:48] cardrenn: they will probably have different abilities
[1:58:52] bottis96: Only winged mounts should get dynamic flying
[1:58:56] bladestitch: The jellyfish mounts would look weird.
[1:58:56] ver_flashbang: The mage manhole cover LuL
[1:58:58] Andersonmps: I couldnt wait for the areal unit animation. or the robot ones
[1:58:59] imthabeast: Ashes with it would be sick
[1:59:07] Axelion: Axelion subscribed with Prime. 
[1:59:08] CrossroadsDealer: so excited for that. If they give me druid flight form dynamice this will be the best game ever
[1:59:10] Noomiad: horses without wings must look strange #lucid nightmare
[1:59:10] Nulgar: get on a Dracthyr, use something that transforms you e.g. into another race, then Soar, it looks really fun tneEvi
[1:59:14] bigoldmeatpie: i mean with mim's head they could add thrusters at the back in place of the barrel roll
[1:59:19] bellzzar1: if the rockets don't get dynamic then no deal
[1:59:25] Fro_J_Simpson: what about the broom mount from the Trader's monthly reward last October?
[1:59:29] saarkhastick: So wait, I was away but heard mention of Endless Possibilities. What happened to the ability? Isit account wide yet? It seems to be missing on the char that I bought it on...
[1:59:31] kaijoe_: I mean, the delves exclusive mount is that rocket helicopter thing, so there's some sort of tech there
[1:59:37] cardrenn: not all, but like, wingless mounts might not have the spin ability
[1:59:37] Saumur: Maybe they will get transfered into the new categories with their specific abilities
[1:59:41] Andersonmps: Rockets and robots!
[1:59:43] AtomJar: Wasnt there a data mined dynamic ground mount thing?
[1:59:50] AlanC2024: yes they do
[1:59:57] MrScotticus: Yeah, it's so nice
[2:00:01] bottis96: give spiders and some crawling mounts ability to crawl up vertical walls
[2:00:16] Fibnkak: I have spent 20 years as a Engineer and if there is zero dynamic lfying i am gonna be sad AF @ad
[2:00:21] bladestitch: Do you think we'll get a revamp on underwater- and ground mounts as well?
[2:00:25] alextheblight: does the electricity do anything?
[2:00:28] Gryf_91: dragon ridings makes my pc fans go crazy
[2:00:29] aeson_of_raid_sock: how do you move dragon rider? I don’t see an option
[2:00:31] bigoldmeatpie: i think they could do family abilities that lump models together, like all of the gryphons have the collector's mount ability
[2:00:31] cinhotlanta: Mechanical mounts should have their own suite of talents like thrusters, glider wings, etc.
[2:00:34] thunduz: I'm sad that you can't dragonrace as an Evoker. Dragon Dragoning with Soar is so damn cool
[2:01:05] thunduz: stepped away to make a sandwich lol sorry
[2:01:12] Harai_Ulfsark: i think its worse since my dracthyr is a double gatherer so gathering while soaring doesnt work
[2:01:20] thunduz: solid point
[2:01:21] Andersonmps: Soar has a cast time too, doesnt it?
[2:01:31] AlanC2024: btw tali. after your stream before last I went and done all challenge and reverse challenge races. All done now. Thanks to the flick trick :D
[2:01:40] Andersonmps: Oh, fair
[2:01:52] Rico_Azzarash: They should just give the Dracthyrs to go in Flight mode and it will works as common dragon riding
[2:01:53] avatarlord: flick trick?
[2:01:58] GameingAspect: #add
[2:02:03] str4ysheep: maybe when they add new abilites in war within for new mounts, the other mounts of that class/type get the same ability
[2:02:04] bladestitch: Did them all without the flick trick.
[2:02:12] Noznatation: Wow
[2:02:13] cardrenn: nice trick
[2:02:13] Saumur: For Science that was Kappa
[2:02:13] thomaslb95: hi
[2:02:13] MrScotticus: cool trick
[2:02:14] tarnishedvalor: lol
[2:02:14] Noznatation: Feel like a winner now
[2:02:14] JMan31337: GG
[2:02:15] Andersonmps: Deadge
[2:02:16] Harai_Ulfsark: thats a good trick
[2:02:18] Auviance: nice trick
[2:02:18] Nerzalus: The flick of death
[2:02:18] MeggoArt: cool trick
[2:02:19] cinhotlanta: Such a great video, been refining my Flick feverishly ever since
[2:02:19] alextheblight: seems effective ngl
[2:02:20] dergNwolf: priest main btw tippiSmug
[2:02:20] MichaelXIII: #ad
[2:02:21] Clever_Husky: 10/10 would try this trick
[2:02:21] bellzzar1: forgot to levitate xD
[2:02:21] Fibnkak: what na trick
[2:02:22] MavisSiobhan: That was a super cool trick.
[2:02:22] Andersonmps: Good trick mate
[2:02:23] kahdia_: that was an amazing trick
[2:02:23] cosmopanda13: damn I'll go try it out now thanks tali!
[2:02:23] Sujis: that was a cool trick
[2:02:24] Ryall_: I haven
[2:02:24] Nulgar: cazikyUrip
[2:02:24] avatarlord: good shield
[2:02:24] thunduz: I don't think that is going to help winning races
[2:02:25] Kazarack_Azalea: I will always use this now
[2:02:26] Fibnkak: clip this
[2:02:26] funviking99: LUL
[2:02:27] xavier001: well done
[2:02:27] sjirvine: I love that trick!
[2:02:28] Saumur: I won every race by not attempting as well! Kappa
[2:02:28] AlanC2024: tneTaliSelch
[2:02:30] thunduz: tneTaliCry
[2:02:30] Sujis: wowsers
[2:02:30] bigoldmeatpie: a trick you can only do once
[2:02:30] beohoof: #ad
[2:02:31] wildgrowth_: fly like an eagle
[2:02:31] Camaris_: hashtag ad
[2:02:31] JMan31337: good thing it was not hardcore
[2:02:31] Toorps_: Haha, that goes for me aswell. Challenge races are a joke now
[2:02:32] bladestitch: Did them all without falling off as well. :P
[2:02:32] str4ysheep: levitate where?
[2:02:34] BeerGeekBones: What a cool trick #ad
[2:02:35] Nulgar: #ad
[2:02:35] kikisume: sick trick #ad
[2:02:36] thunduz: Stupid game #ad
