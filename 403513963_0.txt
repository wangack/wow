But the truest victory, my son, is stirring the hearts of your people. I tell you this, for when my days have come to an end, You shall be King.

[7:37:30] KewTroll: @Micckh I have. I did so for several months. But P2W results in an advantage that others will have to either P2W as well or play for months and months to achieve the same spot. P2W means you can't quite catch up if the P2W person keeps playing. But you can catch up to a person getting boosted and eventually you can't tell a difference between a guy who got boosted and one who did not

[7:59:16] Trohuz: @DeathLyst you talk like paying through tokens were the only means to obtain large amounts of gold, try playing the action house for a while, it's actually more efficient, since there's a cap on how many tokens you can put up at once

[7:59:25] IAttackYou: it is explosive its wrong affix on screen
[7:59:26] coffeebottom: you guys are forgetting that there is an equivalent exchange. the token you buy with money is bought from the auction house by a player with a lot of gold. you then buy raid materials, pots, flasks, food,boxes, etc from a player who then makes that gold back. it's not like you buy a token for 20 dollars and get directed to a private shop where you buy whatever you want.,
