[1:19:35] Dolphinwithfeet: Yeah they need that nerf. They never run out of mana in pvp

[1:31:10] ThisTHC: community perception is a helluva drug KEKW
[1:31:21] Clicklesly: Yeah, i switched to hunter to get away from melee, why would i go Surv?
[1:31:21] wholedoorz: @slippyfistlol no Survival don't have to stack on ranged for Sludge

[1:31:47] Carryout: as a hunter main, if I wanted to play melee I would main a DK or rogue
[1:31:49] MrKray2: Survival is by far, with out a doubt the best melee hunter spec, change my mind @towelliee
[1:31:51] grapyz: well pretty close anyways lol
[1:31:52] Liquiditara: yo have u ran as Ret in raid its awsome

[1:32:05] Dinosew: I tried survival and I would switch out my weapons and it wasn't too bad.
[1:32:08] XCEL_TLOU: survival only has 1 true melee talent all others are ranged abilitles
[1:32:11] Kinghorn: the world doesnt need more melee sadly
[1:32:12] GermanBacon: @MrKray2 you are technicaly correct.....
[1:32:16] Ruthron: Plus is survival is super fun
[1:32:19] Dlaw25: Swifty pvps Survival
[1:32:22] Spankalicous1: i out dps alot of boomkins as Feral.
[1:32:23] howitser105: boomkins are untouchable atm nothing comes close
[1:32:25] Clay2K_: Unfair Feral standard towCry defend the oppressed
[1:32:27] BreakingSeth: When you think they will come out with a new clas
[1:32:30] slippyfistlol: oooh im the best survival hunter in the world............ out of 2 players kekw
[1:32:30] smashwow: feral has the damage. boomy has the toolkit and damage

[1:32:34] MrKray2: @germanbacon facts
[1:32:45] Roaringkittylol: Need to make BM deul wielding axe melee hunter with 2 pets (Rexxar) - MM and SV need to be full range
[1:32:47] LordKain73: survival takes skill. MM is derp spec.

[1:36:55] RunningOutOfRAM: you might have 1 character and get it on the first try LUL
[1:36:55] Masqerader: @Towelliee I actually like one his idea for deaths in mdi, he is right the lack of checkpoints and run back is overkill
[1:36:57] sinlesssinner: yea in SL, a lot of ppl are able to level more characters. Its a good thing IMO
[1:36:59] malmusdon: Second account?
[1:37:04] WinkingSkull: I haven't played since the first couple weeks of launch. How's the state of the game?

[1:38:00] Aro725: perfect TY
[1:38:03] KingSlayerYotam: better
[1:38:07] Kinghorn: imagine playing wow for fun
[1:38:08] kokochris: this isnt a plan, its a soft rant
[1:38:23] Aubue: all level LUL

[1:38:26] Riztek: Riztek subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 102 months, currently on a 102 month streak! 
[1:38:43] FishAndKids: Move MDI stream from Youtube to Twitch would make it 10 times better instantly.
[1:39:16] DoritoGaming_: Bring back valor points and for those casuals that want to compete tehy could get extra points or some shit
[1:39:33] ThatGuyFayde: should make it like R6 where you can ban classes lol
[1:39:35] daniarchy: @fishandkids they won't do that since Activision has a deal with youtube
[1:39:44] SweetZZZs: it can still be a competition just got to have brackets maybe? so the average players looking to make the jump can be seen? never seen mdi so i dont know how it is setup.
[1:39:47] smashwow: basically televised time trials.
[1:39:55] FranciscoTheMage: hi @Towelliee who made this list of suggestions?
[1:40:10] 無職提督: speaking of suggestions, how about moving MDI back to twtich for start?
[1:40:14] Martymartang: the amount they have to practice is unsustainable
[1:40:16] Denitor79: make the classes be randomly selected
[1:40:19] sinlesssinner: IE his team :p
[1:40:21] LasersLB: 12 hour days according gingi. Not worth.
[1:40:22] Aubue: is this casual doc
[1:40:38] Todmeister9000: this is all mumbo-jumbo LUL
[1:40:40] Rottencoarse: @Towelliee this is for casuals imo
[1:40:41] WestonTeli: the res time and runback time is the penalty
[1:40:46] Kyrrua: if no penalty then dying is gonna become a tool to run faster
[1:40:47] Martymartang: you already have to run back. that's eneough imo
[1:40:47] Vile_: Eh, IMO he's right. Res time and runback IS a penalty enough.
[1:40:48] Vigi9413: but it's 5sec on live
[1:40:50] Pallananana: Dying should give an determination stack KEKW
[1:40:51] NickLeonhearth: Dont die and there wont be a penalty Kappa
[1:40:52] Masqerader: you lose a lot of time wiping, the added timer isn't needed.
[1:40:53] Rottencoarse: death should be a penalty tbh
[1:40:54] DatSheppy: kinda agree with that tbh - already inherent penalties for dying when playing at that level
[1:40:57] Tava11: I dont think a few deaths makes that big of a difference. 15 seconds usually isn't the make or break to timing
[1:41:01] daniarchy: people would just death skip then
[1:41:02] stabzmcgeee: the 5sec part of deaths isnt the issue in mdi tho,, its the cd loss and runback time thats the problem
[1:41:04] Findlyn: he already pointed out there is a punishment
[1:41:09] pilhass10: just don't die 4Head
[1:41:09] YardRage: dying is NOT IDEAL
[1:41:11] Secondbreakfasttt: man EA gonna kill Anthem, i'm sad
[1:41:12] paulwow777: 4Head
[1:41:16] FranciscoTheMage: the MDI is horrible to watch on YouTube. It just is not as fun as it was on Twitch.. @Towelliee
[1:42:09] soysos91: preferred team view would be nice
[1:42:11] kennyrip7: NA up

[1:42:45] MrLoops: server up on Lux stream
[1:42:47] ThisTHC: chat are servers up
[1:42:47] SerMonstein: Fun is subjective also
[1:42:49] Masqerader: Well what is happening with the MDI isn't working so
[1:42:59] maccaruso: min-new-sha (little things)
[1:43:00] Xailen: too much work, blizz wont do it
[1:43:08] duhworks: I think that's blizzards goals for the MDI
[1:43:12] phantomex2006: servers up
[1:43:18] thiccsushi: blizz doesnt care about MDI or M+
[1:43:19] Carryout: it would be nice to be able to do keys while leveling, with an increase XP for each level of the key
[1:43:22] Lundy76: @Towelliee they need to make their own ranked system like RIO for that to happen, make it competitive for all, where they can actually drive the metrics that are used
[1:43:23] bearlicioussss: I like the total accumulative timer from all 3 dungeons ran
[1:43:24] FranciscoTheMage: @Towelliee damn did i miss the MDI finals already?
[1:43:26] Roffasauras: oh god, what did I tune into
[1:43:27] Pallananana: You watch tournaments to apply sick 400 iq MDI strats in +5 keys... and fail Sadge
[1:43:36] Rottencoarse: @Towelliee MDI is a competition tbh
[1:43:39] DatSheppy: MDI is only fun for those comoeting tbh lol
[1:43:39] Kyrrua: mdi is pve..
[1:43:43] thatguy22777: area 52 is 'up'
[1:43:44] DatSheppy: competing*
[1:43:45] Kyrrua: that's it

[1:44:12] Atrial_: what is current mdi invitation method? @Towelliee
[1:44:13] ThatGuyFayde: class ban will
[1:44:14] Rottencoarse: @Towelliee i think the 'meta' classes is kind of making the mdi unpopular atm
[1:44:17] visforvom: vomlet subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 6 months! 
[1:44:19] Masqerader: they should pull from bfa/legion dungeons lol
[1:44:19] longdongliam_: Class/Map ban would be cool. Or talent bans?
[1:44:26] WestonTeli: it would help if all skill levels can run m+ in game. rio elitists make it difficult af for most of my friends
[1:44:27] GermanBacon: random class comps are needed
[1:44:28] duhworks: spec bans would be fun and the other team can't have the same spec as you
[1:44:30] Mecabeast: id like to see a ranomizer for class and specs
[1:44:31] Scoodles91: class ban will make it a little more diverse, now its 5 clases
[1:44:31] zaraine1: honestly its a bit better than seeing like 3 mages or some shit
[1:44:34] seaperz: @Towelliee do as League of legends, let the teams ban certain classes
[1:44:36] porowozek: at least map bans should be in
[1:44:40] sc0otsmcge3: Are servers up
[1:44:41] KingsandClubs: Did i miss fhe vault?
[1:44:46] Masqerader: @sc0otsmcge3 yes
[1:44:50] stabzmcgeee: but atm its a compitition that isnt appealing for new teams to join in, without new teams it will get very stale watching the same 5-6 teams every cup
[1:44:50] northcub: yes - servers up
[1:44:53] Carryout: realms up
[1:45:04] pilhass10: servers up
[1:45:05] altieri43: YouTube is 10x bigger than twitch
[1:45:06] Solid0Liquid: make them all play prot warriors, demo locks and holy priests

[1:45:23] Kriven: youtube is great for video content but imo its layout for streaming and discovering streams is terrible along with its chat
[1:45:25] octnoir: I'm stukc on loading screen
[1:45:26] octnoir: maaaaan
[1:45:28] craigb_: yea

[1:45:34] Thoreya: lame af
[1:45:35] Zomgboy: I kinda lost interrest in MDI, did watch in BFA but its also on youtube and idk just not my thing
[1:45:37] GermanBacon: Pokemon PokPikachu
[1:45:37] Thoreya: waste of a week
[1:45:39] guapo_uktabi: on twitch you can have a add on that would allow viewers to pick affixes
[1:45:43] DoubleBubbleboi: server maint done already?
[1:45:43] Masqerader: hey guys we have the biggest gaming platform in the world to showcase our events... LETS PUT IT ON YOUTUBE? good idea jeb. you get a raise! 3 months later, Jeb gets laid off
[1:45:44] Baldarsar: and in the end who gives a shit about that tournament crap
[1:45:47] pilhass10: pet battle week is good for people who do that content tho
[1:45:47] Todmeister9000: pet battle week POGGERS
[1:45:51] JBarlak: HS is doing so well over on YouTube nowadays after swapping platforms for their coverage
[1:45:51] mavericks312: pokemon fans love that shit
[1:45:52] CADZtv: i mean mdi was a joke when was still on twitch tho lol
[1:45:52] Mortiie_: Dont let team ban classes let team ban talents. That'd be funny.
[1:45:55] Zeryph: The move to YouTube killed it for me. I hate watching streams on YouTube. For a lot of reasons: the chat interface is worse and you can’t minimize or tab out on mobile without a subscription.
[1:45:57] Wubaghowski: They should do a raid week like they do a mythic week ffs
[1:46:01] CADZtv: when it*
[1:46:03] TembaWrites: pet battle is pointless weekly
[1:46:03] azzurrin: WoW is one of those games that is fun to play, but most of the time very boring to watch.
[1:46:05] JGussey: @Towelliee is Infinitely divisible ooze even good for brewmaster?
[1:46:10] DMreqq: Give a choice to do the normal weekly or pick time walking instead
[1:46:11] ThatGuyFayde: @pilhass10 we can get rid of them to lol
[1:46:18] Henke1983: they should remove the pvp weeks they suck
[1:46:19] stabzmcgeee: that sounds like a keystone masters kinda hting
[1:46:21] azzurrin: eSports side of it
[1:46:25] WestonTeli: wow is a meme shit show so it's fine
[1:46:29] pilhass10: @Wubaghowski you get a hc item from raid tho so it is kinda mythic and raid in one? maybe

[1:47:33] WestonTeli: like what do they want? do they want views or engagement?
[1:47:48] Texas_Mizfit: I don't like how the maze in mist is already known. I would like to see if they would fail the maze or who could do it faster.
[1:47:51] Spankalicous1: Towelliee you are by far my favorite streamer.. thanks for doing what you do..
[1:47:54] Kyrrua: at some point it becomes boring to watch people going for perfect meta and simply running "the best run/pull" against preprogrammed machines.
[1:47:58] JGussey: @Towelliee Im so upset with my brewmasters shit. Divisible ooze is shit, bad ring. Maybe boots

[2:10:32] Twizted23faith: I like having the options but stop putting gear in there that i already have on
[2:10:50] lanara233: Loot direct from dungeons > Weekly vault > Weekly chest
[2:10:56] Aubue: its mmo boi
[2:11:02] ursinealli: yeah, but not everyone has every slot filled, I've gotten the same ring at the same ilvl 3 times
[2:11:09] KYANGOz: The stygia needs to be higher
[2:11:09] JacobBose: yea 18 chests and it was all trash
[2:11:14] Affiiance: Good... the best players should have the best loot
[2:11:16] ordinatron: eh it's not better since all the good gear comes from pvp :l it just sucks to create a raid group and push really hard for progression with 2-3 raid nights during the week when you can just get 2.1k very easily in RBG. No point pushing mythic raids when you get a free 233 weapon from pvp :l
[2:11:17] KYANGOz: Like maybe 3k stygia
[2:11:17] Odinslayer: its either you are full geared or unlucky af to have 6 options not an upgrade lol, since the start of the expansion i get an upgrade from each week
[2:11:21] sdpercussion: who cares if the vault sucks one you're ilvl 226....the problem is how slow gearing is (aside from pvp) early patch, when it actually matters @Towelliee
[2:11:25] FranciscoTheMage: @Towelliee which means it rEALLY sux for the rest of us
[2:11:42] Thoreya: i mean there was always gonna be a point in time where the vault wouldnt have much value
[2:11:51] Thoreya: and now its starting to be the time bc the cap is like 226
[2:11:52] hackenshaw: Vantus rune for Dungeon and raid bosses should fill slots of Vault withe that bosses loottable
[2:11:56] Sandisy: 1 upgrade per week for many people is not good game design. the disconnect from effort is not fun
[2:12:15] rolando415: They should bring back vendors and some sort of currency to work towards better gear
[2:12:17] Syllvn: But isn't a hard ceiling what everyone wanted? They can't just keep giving you upgrades from the chest?
[2:12:19] Sandman_88: love it
[2:12:23] Merinshard: LUL
[2:12:32] FranciscoTheMage: @Towelliee i dont think blizzard envisioned that people would be maxing out ever slot in the vault
[2:12:36] jerexify: @Towelliee !!! Got a 220 version of the SLG Heraldry trinket on my BDK!
[2:12:43] Capy_IRL: o shit I just ran with you. Feels good man. Tmec Life <3
[2:12:55] GermanBacon: You think you do, but you dont! Kappa
[2:12:56] Syllvn: I did mean "everyone" tbf xD
[2:12:57] luckfore: thats why they are gonna add something like titan residuum to the vault that increases with the higherkey uve done for that week
[2:13:04] sobytide: My chest this morning was a weapon token for an off-hand. A ring, and a cloak, both of which I already have
[2:13:11] pemadsen17: "you think you do, but you don't"
[2:13:24] Vigi9413: but we DO want valor
[2:13:26] LiquidOctopus: varlor points and reware
[2:13:29] Affiiance: I think its good, allows you to play alts and actually be done
[2:13:34] Alienfromger: make it a vendor?
[2:13:36] LiquidOctopus: valor points and rewards for torghast is all we need
[2:13:41] lanara233: Gear is like money. Most people always want more of it than they can reliably earn or handle.
[2:13:53] CrossHybrid: I have only gotten upgrade gear through the vault because it just won't drop in dungeons
[2:13:58] NILLme: TF was an ok system if we was able to also upgrade our ilvl
[2:14:09] Affiiance: People think its just an easy fix, but they dont look at how its going to affect everything in the game
[2:14:16] MistaHat: Titanforgeing / WF still isnt the answer. this gearing system is better in THAT regard. Just get a vendor that mirrors PVP and the problem is solved
[2:14:16] akia03: how was your vault?
[2:14:22] TheJediMessiah: Unpopular opinion: loot system is fine
[2:14:22] maddogbg27: @Towelliee LOL on my alt mage i got 3 2h weps..... and my main hunter has not seen a single vault wep... FML
[2:14:32] TheRealKingofmonkeys: yep i would love to bring back some currency for loot
[2:14:34] Vigi9413: do you want to use valor or just buy it..
[2:14:38] Odinslayer: i swear if they put valor from torghast am gonna riot
[2:14:39] Affiiance: I think its fine too you arent alone
[2:14:40] Bl4ckSauce: kosmosman
[2:14:48] smashwow: look if you're looking for hookers and blow every week, you're gonna die of a heart attack at some point @Towelliee boring is ok for the long haul.
[2:14:48] TheUnknowing: its unpopular and wrong Kappa
[2:14:49] Alienfromger: currency + vendor = problem solved
[2:14:50] branTVx: TheJediMessiah: Unpopular opinion: loot system is fine
[2:14:52] Rictamar: its fine for people who can play a lot
[2:14:56] CADZtv: he most be a pvp'er
[2:14:58] Rictamar: but for the casual, its dogshit
[2:14:59] CADZtv: must
[2:14:59] mrrazputin: how many attemps today ?
[2:15:03] rolando415: get out of chat @TheJediMessiah lol
[2:15:04] MistaHat: @Alienfromger yep! just copy/paste the pvp vendor for mythic plus
[2:15:11] Urebaldd: The loot system in terms of the way it works is fine, the dungeons frequency of drops needs to be altered thats really iy
[2:15:11] Affiiance: Casuals shouldnt have the best gear, its that simple

[2:15:29] MistaHat: @rolando0o no need to be rude when someone may have a differ on an opionion

[2:15:31] luckfore: im not looting the boss just opening the box
[2:15:37] rolando415: I was just kidding

[2:26:53] Jenoseph: glad i already have the mount got it the first year it came out
[2:26:53] Secondbreakfasttt: it slaps pretty good
[2:26:55] burnt420: i would think its more difficult for the rocket seeing its only once a year
[2:27:06] dcorey416: I'm surprised blizz isn't memeing you like fall guys did to tim
[2:27:07] Feorasam: yeah beat them with your meat!

[2:27:32] nastymf_: What lvl do you need to be to get the mount to drop @towelliee
[2:27:42] Secondbreakfasttt: there is a awesome comment about love rocket on wowhead LUL
[2:27:43] Vaikos: I heard about that yeah, curious how it's gonna go

[2:27:50] Templexx: gross haha
[2:27:51] ShadesOBlue: anthem on the table
[2:27:53] Wulfgrym: knew this might happen
[2:27:53] kirshoxd: @Buck_Nasty_ 50
[2:27:55] TheUnknowing: I liked Anthem
[2:27:57] starlord0027: Assuming you didn’t get it yet
[2:28:00] Darthyrevan: get rid of it
[2:28:02] restokin: I have the X-52 rocket, so just pretend that it’s pink DAESuppy
[2:28:02] Secondbreakfasttt: it's RIP imo and i'm sad
[2:28:02] onous_: its dead
[2:28:04] dcorey416: such a flop
[2:28:04] Kriven: i bet they cut their losses
[2:28:04] phigon: well as buying the first anthem, i sure as shit won't be buying a 2nd game
[2:28:05] burnt420: i liked anthem but the fucking lag in that game
[2:28:06] ShadesOBlue: EA doesn't save things, it incorporates
[2:28:07] Jarlan23: are you gonna try it @Towelliee
[2:28:07] Velashen: That sounds bad..
[2:28:07] Lecxion: anthem was actually really fun to play just no incentive to play it
[2:28:09] NewWorldReign: its a fuckin console killer, why continue it?
[2:28:09] FranciscoTheMage: @Towelliee A meeting among who?
[2:28:12] Crowzcut: lol
[2:28:15] subluxt7: gross

[2:28:21] Crowzcut: you towel
[2:28:26] Kriven: Bareebok Obamas lol
[2:28:43] Solid0Liquid: anthem already got my 60 bucks so they fooled me once
[2:28:46] onous_: EA has no love for you u less youre turning numbers

[2:30:10] KryingMoon: Towellie the Prophet HandsUp
[2:30:11] Lunarsear: monkaHmm
[2:30:13] maddogbg27: @Towelliee If i know EA they will can it
[2:30:25] phigon: will the game be free for people that bought the first anthem - b/c if not, they won't be getting money from me
[2:30:31] Sandman_88: so you know its going to be reworked
[2:30:35] Kalitvenec: umiThink
[2:30:48] Jarlan23: mah lined ye
[2:30:50] Mauraderss: 1.52% drop sounds sus. That’s not a bad drop but there’s only like 4 people in game with the mount
[2:30:53] Zansteh: i kinda liked the gameplay
[2:30:57] KryingMoon: towLul
[2:31:09] zenothebambino: XIV was rough when it lauched... 1.0 was just unplayable
[2:31:14] Mattsta: even going up to 90 ppl is really small team for that
[2:31:18] dragothicx: Comparing XIV to Anthem ok LUL
[2:31:21] Blue__Haze: but now ff14 is really good
[2:31:26] s1cKNation: no support anymore battlefront 2 even it has become for free on epic says it all..

[2:31:35] Mitteennss: Anthem has great systems like combat but just end game content to keep me busy
[2:31:38] maddogbg27: @Towelliee They are keeping it going because they fucked over masseffect for that pos, and waiting on DA4
[2:31:40] KingSlayerYotam: they should work on dragon age 4
[2:31:41] LycanKain: If they didn't think it had some type potential, they would've canned it a while ago.
[2:32:07] Jarlan23: and that new mass effect game they teased
[2:32:10] MistaHat: looter shooters are...kind of troubled in the direction they want to go but they never really succeed
[2:32:14] Fatpally: o/
[2:32:15] pavepawns: 10
[2:32:15] dozilla: i miss Hellgate London, still play the private servers...game just needed more love
[2:32:16] pavepawns: days
[2:32:17] dragothicx: Except Destiny 2 which got worse when Bungie decided to remove 50% of content LUL
[2:32:25] maddogbg27: @Towelliee I am forever pissed at EA for what they did to ME because of Anthem...
[2:32:28] Khyber_GT: 2 years ago
[2:32:35] CADZtv: @dragothicx comparing the launch dingus
[2:32:36] Demanisraar: they are Kappa
[2:32:37] TheUnknowing: almost 2 years
[2:32:48] Molvonos: Unfortunately, Looter/Shooters are stupid boring after a while. At least imo and from what others have told me. Diablo 3 isn't much different, but at least there's some RNG/Roguelike to the enemies/events.
[2:32:55] CADZtv: destiny still doing really well so what you even talkling about
[2:32:56] Wulfgrym: im still pessimistic
[2:32:57] Lecxion: Don't do this. Don't give me hope
[2:33:00] Templexx: totally thought my game was just playing diablo music
[2:33:04] Thoriakk: Anthem is a amazing game, problem was the loot and the amount of content
[2:33:05] onous_: Nah, EA lets it run its cycle and kills it when it comes up for an expansion.
[2:33:34] mo197: it's a business
[2:33:48] MattyjTV: i loved anthem at first
[2:33:50] Archiee: Anthem was super fun until you reached the endgame stuff.... then it got soooo stale!
[2:33:59] Zerohz1: ye it was rly fun first week
[2:34:04] Khyber_GT: yea story was dumb
[2:34:05] CADZtv: yh anthem drew me with the gameplay but content was kinda eh
[2:34:08] Sylnus: D2 gameplay isnt meh. Prob the best gameplay for looty shooty imo
[2:34:18] Jarlan23: bioware just kinda stopped innovating and started to listen to metrics too much
[2:34:29] Jarlan23: theye always doing whats most popular instead of making games theyre good at
[2:34:29] Wranglicon: its so VISCERAL. THings move deliberately and sound like they are actually hitting, shooting, landing, etc. Some great sound and mechanical design in Anthem
[2:34:32] Kriven: he means destiny 2
[2:34:32] Archiee: Destiny LUL
[2:34:33] JMoney_1331: destiny 2
[2:34:34] iiWolfyyy: D2 = destiny
[2:34:35] Sylnus: D2= Destiny 2 sorry
[2:34:35] iiWolfyyy: xD
[2:34:39] bec0o: Destiny is good tbh
[2:34:44] Velashen: Destiny 2 has excellent gameplay.

[2:56:43] Roffasauras: tbc and wrath had a good loot system imo
[2:56:49] Garrujak: if Blizz got ride of TF/WF and reset the gameplay systems to Legion, no one would complain
[2:56:55] BrutalBlueberry: Oh you don't like TF WF? THEN NO LOOT FOR ANYONE
[2:56:59] pavepawns: i could do without tier sets
[2:57:04] stallowned: getting rid of Masterloot was one of the worst thing removed imo
[2:57:06] Kromede: CouldYouNot
[2:57:10] propoopimus: tbh the people asking for no titanforging were a very vocal minority imo, who didnt like getting a nice titanforge
[2:57:17] Bl4ckSauce: i just got the mount lol
[2:57:19] MILESkg21: imagine liking TF/WF Kappa
[2:57:22] BrutalBlueberry: I miss tier sets.
[2:57:24] othraerir: more unbalance?
[2:57:25] Thadune: @Towelliee I had a lucky day yesterday... Got the mount from Maldraxxus and the back transmog from Bubbleblood or whatever his name is.
[2:57:31] KingsandClubs: I would implement tier sets and give valors points for other non tier gear
[2:57:33] FullTiltFrozen: tier sets coming back?
[2:57:35] FullTiltFrozen: wtf
[2:57:37] FullTiltFrozen: lmao
[2:57:37] MistaHat: They need to make Tier sets like enchants, that way people can use them in the vault as drops and not hate it
[2:57:39] Vorog1: Are they bringing back tier set bonuses?
[2:57:39] BrutalBlueberry: Even if its purely cosmetic, gimme my class-specific tier set.
[2:57:43] Sandisy: good luck getting your tier set tho, with the drop rates are they are now KEKW
[2:57:46] Garrujak: I mean I found myself not playing SL as much because I don't wanna keep up wtih 897 systems on every character
[2:57:50] pavepawns: i am more worried though at some specs going crazy cause their tier sets are just insanely stronger
[2:57:55] Bl4ckSauce: first try too
[2:57:56] pavepawns: with certain covenants and combos
[2:58:20] MistaHat: @Garrujak what? there arent that many systems? maybe im missunderstanding

[2:58:24] mrpresbaby: towUnforch

[2:58:57] MILESkg21: cosmetic tier WutFace
[2:59:03] pavepawns: so u want class sets not tier sets
[2:59:06] peinen: WutFace WutFace
[2:59:14] mavericks312: I think with the right tier set frost makes can out design fire
[2:59:21] BrutalBlueberry: Cosmetic tier sets, yes. Set abilities are meh. With soulbinds and conduits we really dont really need tier abilities.
[2:59:21] stallowned: true
[2:59:21] IPVPworld: BIG FACTS
[2:59:23] HotHotHeals: preach
[2:59:34] Kromede: somebody in the past was mocking germans: tier=animal in german FeelsBadMan
[2:59:35] IPVPworld: ive been waiting for that for yearss
[2:59:40] 91Niki: MAH CLASS FANTASY PepeHands
[2:59:48] KingsandClubs: Yes just like BFA LUL
[2:59:49] Rakim88: both YEP
[2:59:54] 2chest_1head: I think the Plate set this time came out good
[2:59:57] duncon: i don't like that you buy transmogs with anima. just let us farm it from previous raids like it used to be.
[3:00:07] 2chest_1head: especailly the LFR, that old gold and bronze look
[3:00:08] Thadune: @Towelliee I'm surprised WOW has brought in the ability to dye your gear different and unique colours
[3:00:16] sinlesssinner: yea they said that lol
[3:00:16] Tigerklaue: or legion legendarys
[3:00:20] MistaHat: @duncon technically easier with WQs
[3:00:22] thiccsushi: or azerite powers
[3:00:29] sinlesssinner: they said they were bringing back some legendary effects back
[3:00:32] SimplyRed: i don't think so, with the transmog system, people will change it after a week.
[3:00:32] sinlesssinner: not a surprise
[3:00:35] daniarchy: or reused leggos from legion
[3:00:47] stallowned: 129 gold EZ
[3:00:52] Kromede: i will farm that shit, when world quests give me 500 AP
[3:01:14] othraerir: did you get mollie? it's up this week
[3:01:37] akia03: pet battle weekly?
[3:01:40] sinlesssinner: you liked BFA better than SL?
[3:01:41] Kromede: mollie up? need to tame the boss KEKW
[3:01:53] temp3st98: if they add back sets again for raid so please add back it for pvp aswell
[3:02:00] Toskens: Get rid of all the borrowed powers and all that shit. Less timegating etc etc
[3:02:10] Stanislav__k: ah fuck
[3:02:10] toobaked1987: Whenever you create your thesis youre suppose to support it throughout. That is what blizzard needs to do with an expansion.
[3:02:19] Kittastrophe: tencent loves mobile tho
[3:02:26] akia03: wouldnt tier sets always beat m+ gear tho
[3:02:35] Phae__: I just don't get why they implement such cool and unique class specific content, e.g., Legion artifact weapons, only for them to be completely irrelevant later on. "These are the best weapons in the history of ever" (except for when they're trash in 2 years)
[3:02:42] Kromede: my boss once tried to convince me DayZ is spoken days .... KEKW
[3:03:09] DeanoTV: alllll the cosmetics
[3:03:11] Scoodles91: its out, and its free
[3:03:22] othraerir: cuz they make more money without a sub
[3:03:29] Colt_Engineer: Do you guys not have phones? KEKW
[3:03:36] deadawake_: <3 you Tow
[3:03:45] Kittastrophe: they wanted league of legends to convert to mobile but Riot refused saying that the game couldn't be ported to mobile and so that's how Wild Rift came to be.
[3:03:49] redrobe: Wait riot goingto louch MMO?? trkGasp
[3:03:55] xrandomdoodx: good, WoW needs competition to get their ass in gear as incentive to make the game better and keep subs lol
[3:04:05] Templexx: ahh the ole $75 gun skins move.

[3:07:31] xconsniper: The top shareholders of Activision Blizzard are Robert A. Kotick, Daniel Alegre, Dennis Durkin, Vanguard Group Inc.
[3:07:38] Seerated: Yea, they're basically owning the world at this point..but silently
[3:07:41] TechNinja20: Path of exile is owned by tencent
[3:07:43] MyriaK: What is this "theater" thing you speak of?
[3:07:53] brucezhu: The largest portion of tencent income is not gaming, but their Chinese version of facebook which has more than one billion users
[3:08:10] Kittastrophe: as long as it doesn't end up falling down the path of swtor Sadge
[3:08:12] Kromede: pretty PrideLion
[3:08:15] Thoreya: riots mmo man gona be verrrrry enticing

[3:29:37] Kelloggs9: Carson Wentz is damaged goods man. You don't want that contractnightmare.
[3:29:50] mavericks312: honestly the 1st makes the deal for them cause foles and cohen are washed up
[3:29:51] PokerFaceMoose: philly should pay to get rid of wentz contract

[3:30:54] paulson14: hes not damaged goods coming from a a eagles fan he needs to be put in a less toxic fan base sitution with a solid offensive line to protect him.
[3:31:10] Kelloggs9: If you're a colts fan dude, I think making a minor trade for Minshew might be more in line with what you guys need.
[3:31:15] Hoodicon: im a falcons fan...

[3:32:12] paulson14: Wentz to colts, I bet he goes 35 and 7 next season with 5 sacks.
[3:32:17] Thadune: Just bring Andrew Luck out of retirement and go "look we finally have a oline for you!"

[3:34:41] TiredCarcass: bears want wentz
[3:35:00] Kelloggs9: IND needs to avoid Trubisky though - that's the danger zone.
[3:35:03] paulson14: @Blueduck89 I am a hardcore eagles fan to but I want wentz to leave and succeed else where, we don't have the right players around him he needs protection jason kelce can't stop them all lol.

[3:50:37] Phae__: "We've decided the 30% mana nerf to hpals was too much, so we're buffing all paladin specs by 15%"
[3:50:39] Zansteh: won a rbg and i got 2 points
[3:50:42] Todmeister9000: HYPE towPog
[3:50:49] Zomgboy: ah ok :)
[3:50:54] mavericks312: still do t get why overwatch 2 is a thing just make it dlc
[3:51:09] pavepawns: announcement: all loot is now set to 226 and forced warmode in Oribos. GL to everyone and dont die
[3:51:22] Kromede: wow mobile
[3:51:27] BrutalBlueberry: Love Rocket changed to lvl 60 only
[3:51:30] Phae__: We're enforcing runescape wilderness rules in Oribos. You do, you lose your loot
[3:51:38] Phae__: die*
[3:51:40] afoxylegendarydh: towlliee gets love rocket 2041
[3:51:46] Kneckt: i could see valor or justice coming in

[3:51:58] fox_toni: Valor
[3:52:01] Jarlan23: if they bring back titanforging id throw a fit
[3:52:02] Grinch2129: wtb more castle nathria drops q.q
[3:52:05] Kneckt: 10 AM = "JUSTICE AND VALOR IS BACK!"
[3:52:07] Urebaldd: @Kneckt for sure man, it's gonna happen
[3:52:08] mavericks312: I could see a valor point system announced
[3:52:08] wawila: Announcement: warforged and titanforged is back!
[3:52:10] MOLAR305: ilvl changes from m+
[3:52:14] paulson14: just make it feel more rewarding.
[3:52:16] JansonLives: Big Love Rocket: 69. NICE!
[3:52:17] Todmeister9000: more loot drops in LFR towPog
[3:52:24] Strik3r019: yea but they should still make that change as well for next season
[3:52:31] Todmeister9000: or upgrade LFR loot to heroic towPog
[3:52:38] Fptlol: or make it easier
[3:52:39] osheait: With Stygia LMAO
[3:52:46] mavericks312: anima gear upgrades
[3:52:58] Phae__: You can now spend stygia to upgrade your gear because we know how much you guys love the Maw
[3:52:59] gidgeet: Easier to get gear is most likley
[3:53:02] Jarlan23: ^ you can do that with covenant gear. they shoudl just op the ilvl on it
[3:53:20] Aidler: new difficulty for raids with perma death
[3:53:23] Strik3r019: yea, what if every 500 anima spent gave =3 ilvl to your current gear?
[3:53:25] GoKu1g: @Towelliee I disagree with the currency thing, they just need to increase the ilvl of gear and drop rates across the board. Valor point system doesnt matter if loot was Legion/Bfa Style.
[3:53:26] Alexjw90: Anima is most likely
[3:53:32] Alexjw90: The solution they would use
[3:53:49] mavericks312: instead of only covering gear allow anima to upgrade all gear
[3:53:49] Skizzurp: the crazy part of pvp too is the vault items even if low ilvl can be upgraded with honor so u dont even have to stay active once u get 2100+ u can just get low ilvl from vault and then upgrade it still to 226

[3:56:30] dragothicx: Titanforging is back PogChamp
[3:56:31] majorizc: no more anima loot pls
[3:56:32] mavericks312: dude we need reforging back
[3:56:35] BrutalBlueberry: Spend 500anima to buy a token to get 35anima
[3:56:43] mikewamba1: wheres it being broadcasted
[3:56:45] MisterD1rty: 2k anima per bonus roll token... RIP
[3:56:46] Aidler: some people can admit when they are wrong. Ion can't
[3:56:49] wisperuna: @Towelliee just make m+ relevant
[3:56:54] Djulio: HE KNOWS
[3:56:58] Malarick: roll coins cost 10,000 anima
[3:57:01] Cello_73: @Towelliee its interesting how M+ really has not evolved one bit since it went live in Legion. Its why ppl love Legion dung over BFA and SL. However, with loot on m+ in SL, there isnt much to entice us to go ham...imo

[3:58:19] tenassity69: there really isnt a point to heroic raiding lol
[3:58:29] wisperuna: @Towelliee in bfa and legion you were able to skip parts of it as you were albe to gear close to it
[3:58:38] Fptlol: for the money and the women ofc
[3:58:40] Gingerprimer: @Towelliee Increse items that drop by 1 so 3 pieces drop and increse item levels for higher keys

[3:59:09] CockneyRat: I like the 220 weapon from the hc raid
[3:59:09] Sandisy: capped warforging so lower level content can't become better than mythic loot drops. Add currency so you can buy the warforge on items, fixed
[3:59:13] gidgeet: @BrutalBlueberry TY
[3:59:18] Buckwink: some people never leave goldshire inn
[3:59:19] dekaron25: didnt 1 of the guilds that went for world first do like 30 splits or something

[3:59:30] burty_burt69: i dont see the point in mythic plus tbh
[3:59:40] misterwinoe: Just give me more gear in PVE so i dont have to pvp for ilevel
[3:59:41] laeenaravenholdt: I'm a LFR hero and proud of it. Maybe do some +4...Gear is not a thing for me, but I totally get why gearing needs to be adjusted to get better.
[3:59:45] Jeddek_: Soulforged it is @Towelliee

[4:01:29] Karbonn: I wish Mythic+ was actually rewarding past like 205 ilvl.
[4:01:32] TheCliffyShow: If you don't raid or do Mythic+ you shouldn't play WoW. You should go play Barbie Adventures Online, and spend your time braiding your hair and riding ponies.
[4:01:34] Thadune: So in 9 minutes?

[4:02:58] Thadune: @Towelliee I think 200-205 is kind of like the ilevel cap for people who can only manage to be M3-5.. World bosses and very little to no raid time. Cant get higher then that probably
[4:03:06] Alaquane: what if 10 o'clock news is a love rocket on the store?

[4:34:44] MrGattz: @MainlyHigh normally i would agree with you, but people need to run very specific dungeons to have a chance at their bis gear because gear drops are SO rare its not wasting the time running their own key if something better drops from some place else
[4:34:52] Felrane: its boring

[4:35:36] Mockle: i watch the mdi as background noise
[4:35:39] MainlyHigh: @MrGattz well yes i understand that but you have a chance to get that dungeon if you key it i mean 1/8 chance isnt bad
[4:35:39] George2001k: I saw a 2220 IO tank today and almost fainted

[4:37:05] Sollice: RTWF is different because its an unknown for the most part
[4:37:07] Kelloggs9: Ya agreed. Moving to YT was a weird pivot.
[4:37:10] thiccsushi: MDI leaving twitch was a big mistake imo
[4:37:12] galinhoo: Race to world first is a lot better (with comms)
[4:37:21] Kelloggs9: @MainlyHigh completely agree - curious why people don't like MDI.
[4:37:21] MrGattz: i didnt watch the mdi and the race to wf is fun but only the final kill on all bosses
[4:37:35] L4dy_Renegade: Yeah, youtube is a cesspool for toxicity.
[4:37:35] MrGattz: or first kill rather on all bosses
[4:37:44] thiccsushi: we had that with squad stream in mdi
[4:37:47] Wildside1177: The race to WF is 100X to watch for sure.
[4:37:58] Kelloggs9: Obviously
[4:37:59] Wildside1177: 100x better
[4:37:59] MrGattz: cause they got paid for it

[4:58:42] jxecho9094: they wont be able to afford to keep them with how much they are paying mahomes
[4:58:58] Kelloggs9: The defense is full of old guys.
[4:58:58] mavericks312: i think they have to pay chris jones this year
[4:59:14] mavericks312: watkins can go
[4:59:21] Kelloggs9: LDT is gonna be back next year too, that's good.
[4:59:25] Kelloggs9: Watkins is useless.
[4:59:37] Bulgogiprince: I think they let Chris Jones go
[4:59:52] Kelloggs9: ... and the Patriots never paid market value for (a) their QB and (b) most of their other stars.
[5:00:06] mavericks312: it helps when brady isnt setting the market for contracts
[5:00:16] Affiiance: Brady had some shitty players he had to work with some years
[5:00:21] jxecho9094: Brady has never taken salary cap because he wanted a good team
[5:00:27] griffdog125: now Brady's going to go to the Cowboys lol ring 8
[5:00:30] Kelloggs9: Playing against the bills, dolphins and bills 6x per year helps too.

[5:01:32] feherlofia123: @monute316 was wondering the same thing

[5:02:18] lunchbox8669: there was a tease we may get some news today
[5:02:40] Urebaldd: Hope so CN is a snoozefest now
[5:02:45] tracker25: we getting flying very soon, thatrs the news
[5:03:14] Solid0Liquid: we won't get flying for another year almost
[5:03:20] Urebaldd: I honestly don't care about flying much this expansion
[5:03:27] MrGattz: we get flying whenever 9.1 drops
[5:03:36] tracker25: dont bet on it @Urebaldd
[5:03:50] nihav: flying already!?!
[5:03:51] Urebaldd: I think part 1 pathfinder was 9.1
[5:04:06] Urebaldd: Can't remember though bfa is a blur
[5:04:48] Tastus: yeah flying it now tied to reknown
[5:04:52] Tastus: renown
[5:04:52] tracker25: ^ why I said we'll gbet flyingf soon
[5:04:59] mavericks312: with all the bat mounts it was only a matter of time before flying comes
[5:05:01] InvictusXCV: So like pathfinder but not pathfinder :P
[5:05:10] L4dy_Renegade: I thought they weren't even doing flying because " The maps are smaller Kappa "

[5:07:11] fewyn: would not surprise me
[5:07:11] Kelloggs9: That's for sure how it will be lol.
[5:07:12] Celestia6: it would make sense
[5:07:13] im_n0t_jezus: YEP
[5:07:14] KnsWoW: yea thats how it is i think
[5:07:14] L4dy_Renegade: NotLikeThis
[5:07:16] nocturnal_2195: yeah
[5:07:17] Urebaldd: Yep invisible walls here we come
[5:07:18] laeenaravenholdt: It would make sense in having to do that.
[5:07:19] Sandisy: put money on it, of course that's how it will be
[5:07:20] Skizzurp: thats obv cuz of how maps are
[5:07:22] MrGattz: i thought about it. didnt enjoy the thought
[5:07:24] kimmo_gaming: that would be like that ye
[5:07:25] azzurrin: that's what I figured
[5:07:26] AsAboveSoB3low: cause they in different ralms
[5:07:33] AsAboveSoB3low: realms
[5:07:34] Templexx: well yea. if u cant run there u cant fly there
[5:07:35] arrk___: i feel like its too early to release flying anyone else think so?
[5:07:35] TheJediMessiah: Seems the most likely thing
[5:07:42] Venkxx: there are demon hunters going from ardenweald to oribos, so I think it will be possible to move between areas
[5:07:43] laeenaravenholdt: I don't think anyone would be too surprised to hear that.
[5:07:44] mavericks312: i can see them selling an in between mount for like 2 mil gold
[5:07:44] kimmo_gaming: @Towelliee But when flying gets enabled i think we would have portals to each zone
[5:08:01] Urebaldd: I mean we don't even know when 9.1 might release so by the time it does we will probably want flying
[5:08:02] Bayne77: maybe you will be able to fly into that portal that the FP goes through at least?
[5:08:04] Kelloggs9: The pathing out of and to oribos should be 10x faster - and have the flight speed return to normal once you hit the continent you want
[5:08:11] monute316: maybe it will auto send you to the orbois cut scene
[5:08:39] Urebaldd: @Kelloggs9 Agreed
[5:09:12] mavericks312: like one of those ethreal wyrms

[5:09:27] cabalish: ...and that mount is called The Purpose
[5:09:33] Tastus: but even lore wise they could put portals in each zone that allows you to go as now all the covenants are coming together to fight the jailer
