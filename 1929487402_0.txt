[1:26:20] abracka_: subtweet?
[1:26:32] delavor1: like sub tweeting? so stupid LULW
[1:26:39] Molvonos: 'Being a disingenuous fuck?' lol
[1:27:04] eainzsp: but why do it? if he had issue with him dm him and talk to him without having the public watch
[1:27:08] Mozzeyy_: Tbh I think Panda was way off base with his claims. Ofc Bellular is making positive videos about WoW when things are good and vice versa
[1:27:30] eainzsp: i dont inherently disagree with panda either but just seems off to me
[1:27:40] Mozzeyy_: @bliht well its quite obvious he just wanted to farm some clout

[1:33:41] 3663Sharad: @Eshel wait its not? Kappa
[1:33:49] mavericks312: Some ppl who speak on WoW deserve to be ignored bell is one of them
[1:33:51] Murlocz: @towelliee This dwarf is looking like a GIGACHAD
[1:33:59] Rudric_Ice: Bell mostly shit talked in shadowlands and everyone was not just him
[1:34:14] KaisenSiru: Drama Pog
[1:34:20] Eshel: @3663sharad  Only when you run out of valid arguments lmao
[1:34:59] mavericks312: Panda ain’t no bitch though lol
[1:34:59] xhaven: @Rudric_Ice nope he was doing that far longer than just Shadowlands
[1:35:04] Murlocz: @towelliee I think good weapons on Paladins make HUGE difference, bigger than other classes
[1:35:23] Rudric_Ice: If you're calling out someone expect some kind of backlash
[1:35:32] eainzsp: I feel like a lot of people would have that reaction if you attempt to compromise someones livelihood
[1:36:04] volkreig: You see the asmon and panda stream?
[1:36:05] DunzoCD: its endearing there LUL
[1:36:10] cabalish: blizzcon fight ?

[1:36:32] mavericks312: Panda only said what a lot of ppl were thinking of bellular

[1:36:34] Eshel: Cage match !!! lmao
[1:36:34] snuffles_80: I love that world
[1:36:57] cabalish: streamers in germany did fight on gamescom
[1:37:19] Mozzeyy_: @mavericks312 not really, i see the majority calling Panda out for BS
[1:37:21] herzlustafir: contacted steam with some information that can confirm my account is mine pls watch out for streamer CMJFTRKO
[1:37:21] cabalish: yeah
[1:37:27] sliproach: ffs first yt boxing now blizzcon boxing Kappa

[1:37:52] herzlustafir: they made the like go to a twltch.tv link with a L instead of a "i"...
[1:37:58] mavericks312: @mozzeyy_ wrong most ppl calling panda out are from 2 ppl community I’ll let you figure out who
[1:38:09] Eshel: Bel and Panda headlining Wrestlemania - confirmed
[1:38:22] Rudric_Ice: Panda kept dodging questions and a lot of questions
[1:38:43] herzlustafir: DONT KLICK THAT
[1:38:45] xhaven: youtube: "everyone hates..." Reality its 10 comments on Reddit
[1:38:59] Mozzeyy_: @rudric_ice he was like Neo in matrix
[1:39:00] 3663Sharad: Cameo during that fight at Wrestlemania Baldmongold KEKW
[1:39:04] eainzsp: i dont inherently disagree with panda, but panda is absolutely in the wrong for calling out bell specifically
[1:39:08] Molvonos: You shouldn't be clicking shit random folks are sending you anyways.
[1:39:13] Vealzy: what weakaura/addon is the exp bar?

[1:44:35] delavor1: oof dead by level 5, how does that happen
[1:45:14] Eshel: Because everyone was at home all damn day lmao
[1:45:20] mavericks312: Everyone forgets shadowlands had a pandemic to help it
[1:45:42] TheTokyoDevil: ture
[1:46:01] Heyhowsitgoingtonight: Shadowlands also had Korthia, the best mid expansion added zone ever
[1:46:25] Rudric_Ice: @heyhowsitgoingtonight  u mean the worst
[1:46:31] Eshel: SL was middle of the road - far from best but not the absolute worst either
[1:46:35] ronny_84: a big part oif people stopped playing was the lawsuit and other stuff that came out of the company itself
[1:46:37] kimmo_gaming: they had a great idea, with covenants, gearing, bringing tier sets back and all that, but after that it was not good
[1:46:43] Heyhowsitgoingtonight: @Rudric_Ice nope :)
[1:46:58] geokouts: champion tier items are easier to get as casual
[1:47:04] KingSlayerYotam: Casual dont need to do anything, you can get to 420 just doing world content
[1:47:23] KingSlayerYotam: And he doesn't need more then that
[1:47:35] mavericks312: Max looked at raid numbers last week and raiding is actually up more in normal an heroic this xpac then it was last
[1:47:42] geokouts: 422 without M+ and LFR
[1:47:44] Nasilvera: I think also far as mythic people are more about the meta game now and casuals like to play the class they like
[1:47:58] white_rice9: i personally could care less about my gear, I just play the solo content for my own form of fun.

[1:48:11] AWreal: Raiding is harder to commit to when they are so many other games out there that are also good. Just hard to commit to raid times without it feeling like a chore at some point

[1:53:40] Moobot: @NOTMES coming in with the 328 viewer raid! PogChamp

[1:54:26] Eshel: Like a counselor will say - don’t use the words “always” or “never” in an argument
[1:54:27] Rudric_Ice: If negative content doesn't resonate with the people people wouldn't watch it but it does that's why people are watching it bcuz they miss that stuff of what wow used to be

[1:55:16] ZooNamiii: i enjoy retail ....i dont have time to read Reddit or watch youtube
[1:55:27] wEiRdO_dUdE: Every time I log into retail WoW, I see plenty of people doing things, and I restarted on a lower population server
[1:55:32] veryhairyheyyall: ^
[1:55:55] Eshel: A person thinks wow sucks - they go to a “wow sucks” video - it becomes an echo chamber and not a true reflection
[1:55:55] Yagr6: what did wow "used to be"
[1:56:00] dracullus: @ZooNamiii Reddit is suprisingly very, very positive this expansion
[1:56:02] Molvonos: Those rose-tinted glasses and nostalgiamongering is strong.
[1:56:07] mavericks312: Go to a dream surge or time rift and tell me ppl don’t play wow lol
[1:56:14] Jarlan23: people like to argue and they want to see the giants fall
[1:56:23] Jarlan23: we like drama
[1:56:29] Molvonos: 'Why cant I play the game the way it used to be?' Because you know how the game is and you can't claim ignorance like we had when we first played the game.

[1:56:36] wEiRdO_dUdE: Reddit doesn't like anyone LUL
[1:56:44] Eshel: Reddit is like watching special ed kids fighting on the playground lol
[1:56:47] feiqwan: Ya reddit is crazy af
[1:56:57] Heyhowsitgoingtonight: fuck bellular, hypocrite
[1:57:00] kimmo_gaming: Panda was like "I know Belular will make a reaction about my reaction now" LOL
[1:57:04] veryhairyheyyall: LUL
[1:57:13] Yagr6: reddit: hating on Bellular is trending??? ok lets go with that
[1:57:23] gooni_coyg: but they all love Towelliee :D
[1:57:27] Molvonos: @Yagr6 Nah, they've been hating him for a long time.
[1:57:30] Flebboo: All i see are a bunch of people who hatewatch wow, haven’t played since mop/wod, looking for any form of content that validates their point that they made a great decicion quiting and that we who stuck around are just mindless shills
[1:57:33] adxx: Reddit is toxic. Dragonflight is a good expansion for the game, but just shows how much blizzard has changed over the past 2 decades. not necessarily a bad thing
[1:57:42] Jarlan23: yeah /r/wow never liked bellular or asmon
[1:57:43] Tauren0309: Dan the man
[1:57:52] DunzoCD: he keeps his head down on the PTR
[1:58:00] Eshel: @flebboo  Agreed 100%
[1:58:00] wEiRdO_dUdE: Mr. GM hasn't really upset anyone that I've seen, which is a smart way to go, true
[1:58:10] adxx: adxx subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 12 months, currently on a 5 month streak! Only doom reddit scroll on my phone otherwise I can't go on that site.
[1:58:12] luckfore: that guy has the most hate watchers lol
[1:58:18] Yagr6: im gonna go play OW2 in spite of all the hate
[1:58:19] EarlofCockwood: @Flebboo i agree
[1:58:19] belfastcl: ptr reporter
[1:58:25] dracullus: well Asmon started as down to earth guy discussing game too Kappa
[1:58:33] Molvonos: There's one guy who hates Mr. GM.
[1:58:52] Jarlan23: dont you get a t-shirt from that quest
[1:58:54] Molvonos: I saw this random blerb in that thread who ragged on Mr. GM at random, lol
[1:59:01] dracullus: I think that big community would broke anyone
[1:59:07] AWreal: farm 5 flasks of oil before you go to lighthouse @Towelliee
[1:59:16] wEiRdO_dUdE: I could see some of the anti-spoiler people not liking Mr. GM, maybe
[1:59:18] PadidinJones: @Towelliee carful. many have died to murkeye and his cronies the murlocs
[1:59:18] Savagee320: @towelliee on a different topic, did you see that Chubb nasty knee injury?
[1:59:42] ZooNamiii: Didnt Max dispel the raid, and M+ numbers were low this season ?
[1:59:48] Jarlan23: i heard about it but i did not wanna watch that shit
[1:59:52] Jarlan23: i heard his knee went backwards
[2:00:09] Ovium56: @Savagee320 man that was so bad
[2:00:18] ZooNamiii: numbers
[2:00:24] wEiRdO_dUdE: Raid engagement seems strong, a lot of people have been raiding
[2:00:46] 911Viking: i dont quite get the crowd that hates the game but wants update videos on the game
[2:00:53] Ovium56: @Jarlan23 yeah his leg basically turned into a 7 just the wrong way
[2:01:06] Savagee320: Yeah, it could be career ending, too.
[2:01:07] Jarlan23: @Ovium56 WutFace
[2:01:09] Sylphy_TV: ironmouseJam
[2:01:15] Eshel: @jarlan23  Just watched the clip - it bent all kinds of wrong
[2:01:17] ZooNamiii: He said that comparison of season 2 Shadowland was the whole expansion kills...and  DF season 2 is only 12 weeks so far
[2:01:33] Ovium56: @Savagee320 yeah same knee and possible injury from college
[2:01:45] wEiRdO_dUdE: Oh yeah, the patch cycle is way faster now
[2:01:48] Jarlan23: this season has felt very long though for some reason
[2:02:10] dracullus: except Sepulcher, funny enough
[2:02:11] zysmos: I would personally want Blizzard to put 10 man raiding so I could join a small 10 man guild, I think 20 people is annoying and stressful
[2:02:15] JQ47: I things there are way to many h factors from.inaode and outside of wow to ever properly account
[2:02:16] mavericks312: He did it in 17 week increments s2 inDF hasn’t hit 17 weeks yet
[2:02:34] Yagr6: the difference is that ring was interesting, this time around its meh
[2:02:38] CeruleanStar: just gives me a bit more time to finish gearing my WAR
[2:02:42] Molvonos: @zysmos Why exactly is 20 people annoying and stressful and 10 isn't?
[2:02:49] ZooNamiii: main thing was Jaina kills was for whole expansion vs DF is only a few weeks of kills
[2:02:56] ZooNamiii: in season 2
[2:03:10] herzlustafir: my gifts towCry  my games towCry

[2:03:19] wEiRdO_dUdE: I've heard them say that flexible raid sizes are what they try to shoot for, with scaling and such
[2:03:45] Achandler0409: Morning toweliee, have a great day brother
[2:03:46] TomCat: @Molvonos be a manager and have 20 direct reports vs. 10. which is more work?
[2:04:11] zysmos: @Molvonos Because it's difficult to put together 20 people of a similar skill level 3 times a week, people get tired because progression is slow people don't showup more and more it's just such a logistic nightmare
[2:04:30] Rudric_Ice: @molvonos  bcuz it is easier ?  LOL
[2:04:31] Moobot:  Towelliee.com has all of your Towelliee news WoW UI addon information, and merchandise collection. Check it out!
[2:04:37] dracullus: @zysmos that's kinda very niche issue with raiding though, imo Blizzard should focus rather how to encourage totally casual people to try normal raids and M+ 2 to 10
[2:06:00] UtherBrexton: market to
[2:06:04] zysmos: @zysmos And the more people you have the more annoying it is to manage you'll always have people that don't quite fit in and with 10 man you cut that problem in half
[2:06:07] Jessethoth: Average audience member cares not for variable details. Too much time, have to go do work job.
[2:06:16] Yagr6: if you're not trying m+ or raiding then i literally dont know what people are doing in wow... mayb pvp but yikes
[2:06:19] belfastcl: some casual players thrived in a 40 raid environment, they could just chill in the back with no responsability (more or less the lfr effect)
[2:06:22] Molvonos: @TomCat It's a game.  20 people and 10 people isn't that much different.  I've been playing since Vanilla and could wrangle 40 mouthbreathers to raid MC with little issue, so I didn't understand how it was that big of an issue comparitively.
[2:06:24] Jessethoth: They don't look into the nitty gritty. I get what you're saying
[2:06:48] CeruleanStar: i think shadowlands burned a lot of players... and DF is a solid xpac that if they keep the philosophy up will bring back players in the next xpac imo
[2:06:55] PotbellyGoat: I'm trying The First Descendant since it's free beta
[2:06:59] Necrothia: Back to level 20 :) soon Wailing Caverns run
[2:07:05] goldenharpbilly: Data without the analysis part
[2:07:10] Molvonos: And unless you're talking about Mythic Raiding (which given the 20 man limitation, you are), you don't think it would be more 'annoying' to balance the raid environment around a team half as much that doesn't allow for more class/spec diversity?
[2:07:12] zysmos: @zysmos also being around 20 people that I don't know is just stressful for me

[2:07:48] Sylphy_TV: NODDERS
[2:07:51] CDubTheRIPper: towelstradamus never fails
[2:07:52] zysmos: @Molvonos I mean you're on discord with these people right ?
[2:08:09] Jessethoth: @Towelliee Would you say in that way, that's why live reactions are better?
[2:08:20] Jessethoth: @Towelliee Like streaming overtakes video content in a way for that.
[2:08:29] inbedwithEd: DAMN
[2:08:34] Molvonos: @zysmos And only a fraction of them are ever talking, and they're not physically there.  I don't understand how that could effect someone who enjoys playing MMOs
[2:08:36] Heyhowsitgoingtonight: HUH
[2:08:37] Yagr6: wait WUT
[2:08:47] Eshel: WoW should just release a version that solely follows community feedback - just to show what a shitstorm it would be lmao
[2:09:03] Phatori: @towelliee stop you’re making us think man
[2:09:06] zysmos: @Molvonos that's the way I feel that's it
[2:09:37] CeruleanStar: YT let's you change the thumbnail and title now too if you aren't getting enough initial views~ lol
[2:09:59] ZooNamiii: classic andys get mad when you refer to Retail as Wow .... then they pop up like chris rock said about crack heads
[2:10:16] dscholl82: @Towelliee   I have double hernia surgery at 11:30am today.   Thought I'd pop on and watch my favorite streamer in case it's my last
[2:10:22] Yagr6: @Towelliee there is a take that mythic raiding should just be the challenge and heroic should give the best gear! what do you think about that?

[2:11:16] t_train_va: 14 doesn't do it that way
[2:11:19] Flebboo: that wouldn’t work for wow, we’re way too gear drive
[2:11:22] Flebboo: driven*
[2:11:22] KiLLMasTer20: How long is the down time today
[2:11:23] dracullus: some people even want horizontal progression in wow, ugh
[2:11:28] mavericks312: That would never work for WoW, mythic scene would die at that point
[2:11:31] wEiRdO_dUdE: It would be a shock if mythic didn't give gear, yeah
[2:11:41] Billo0w: wow is about efficency, if you dont get anything from mythic, you dont do it
[2:11:54] ZooNamiii: season 4 ...the fated raid could try it
[2:11:55] CeruleanStar: i just don't think wow devs will make the ridiculously amazing weapons for everyone that FFXIV does -- that is why they only do it for 1 raid an xpac
[2:12:05] DargieK: @t_train_va i'm pretty sure the highest difficulty raids in FFXIV give better gear right? Savage i mean
[2:12:12] CeruleanStar: i think it would be cool to do it like FFXIV in that they only do it for 1 raid each xpac
[2:12:13] dscholl82: @towelliee  no the easy one is an umbilical hernia.  So my belly button just looks like an outty  But my hiatal hernia is the big one.  1/2 of my stomach isn't where it's supposed to be, so that's the big reason this going to take 2.5 hours
[2:12:22] t_train_va: Yes

[2:14:08] t_train_va: I have to schedule hernia surgery myself. Waiting until the new year to hit my deductible on day 1
[2:14:09] moophoria2008: I have a stomach hernia that won't respond to surgery, so I had to change my diet to stop heartburn and vomiting
[2:14:17] HAMMERRAZOR: hey towelliee and chat
[2:14:25] dscholl82: @towelliee  The hiatal hernia is where your diaphragm weakens where your esophagus goes thru the diaphragm and connects to your stomach.  Because of this, the top part of my stomach has popped up thru that hole in my diaphragm and is up under my left lung
[2:14:46] moophoria2008: The diet change made weight fall off me because the hernia hates fat
[2:15:00] Frank4LuLz: hernia
[2:15:00] dscholl82: @Towelliee    When I eat it feels like i'm choking because the food has a hard time passing thru
[2:15:27] cptrogers123: Lost 24kgs in 4 months and i've never been better @Towelliee
[2:15:32] Yagr6: i always hit the track 2 nights a week for 1hour runs with the air pods
[2:15:43] feiqwan: My hernia was very noticeable one, but luckily was not in pain. Post surgery is rough, after care is important.
[2:16:05] dscholl82: @Towelliee  Yeah the umbilical hernia doesn't hurt.  Doc just said he'd fix both at once
[2:16:15] feiqwan: Good luck with surgery, hopenyou feel better soon.

[2:21:22] Molvonos: @prestonworldonr6 Moobot tells you precisely why you were timed out by the bot.
[2:21:28] MrLongGone: 28
[2:21:28] Heyhowsitgoingtonight: 28k is 70%
[2:21:52] Rudric_Ice: @GodKingMuninn when did he say that now u trying to reach
[2:21:56] PhoenixAuTv: Like don't have to be a chef to know foods raw, don't have to play a game to know bad systems exist, ya'll got a weird mindset saying can't comment unless you've done blahs...
[2:21:58] Heyhowsitgoingtonight: how much are you paying in taxes on 28k
[2:22:12] GodKingMuninn: @Rudric_Ice like constantly back in SL videos
[2:22:25] Molvonos: @Rudric_Ice He said it in one of his vids.  A few months back, minimum.  Maybe years.
[2:22:45] Noobicron: thats what lil wayne said too lol
[2:22:49] herzlustafir: im gonna get this rascal
[2:22:54] DargieK: damn near 50% of your income probably
[2:22:57] Sideways2142: still millions more than most people get
[2:22:59] mavericks312: @phoenixautv if your not playing the game/or doing certain content yes stay quiet and keep it pushing
[2:23:12] Rudric_Ice: @GodKingMuninn ye bcuz y'know why cuz shadowlands was shit everyone had lots of opinions on how to make the game good
[2:23:13] flxchoppa: Im go bye have a good day
[2:23:23] PhoenixAuTv: Really bad mindset dude
[2:23:27] Eshel: @phoenixautv  In your comparison it would equal the game being unfinished - to tell if it’s been seasoned correctly you’d need to taste it
[2:23:28] mavericks312: @phoenixautv max already did a video showing asmons take on raiding was wrong
[2:23:30] Fenixzzz: @prestonworldonr6 bye
[2:23:39] DargieK: yeah invested wisely you can live comfortable for sure but people forget some day you have to retire lol
[2:23:46] Molvonos: @Rudric_Ice Don't move the goalposts.  He said it, that's all that needed to be proven.  Whether you agree or disagree the expansion was good or not is inconsquential.
[2:23:51] DargieK: and streaming wont be around forever imo
[2:23:53] herzlustafir: bye preston
[2:23:54] cptrogers123: Lost 24kgs in 4 months and i've never been better @Towelliee

[2:24:35] McZkittlez: Bro I am with you on the income piece. I am in sales and its nauseating how much goes to taxes....
[2:24:35] GodKingMuninn: @Molvonos Lol, my point is that it doesn't matter WHO you are. You cannot win with the development choices without people being angry xD
[2:24:48] GodKingMuninn: its a lose lose situation almost always
[2:24:58] Fenixzzz: @kevindargie all the kidz know adays want to be youtubers or streamers, why you think that
[2:25:00] cptrogers123: Aberrus was good tho
[2:25:10] Yagr6: well what are we comparing it to ??? wrath raiding vanilla ...
[2:25:11] UtherBrexton: liked em all but raz
[2:25:18] wEiRdO_dUdE: I was watching Lost Ark last night, those are some insane mechanics, way tougher

[2:25:27] CrusaderNero: you were the first streamer I followed for real
[2:25:27] McZkittlez: streaming will be around forever
[2:25:29] McZkittlez: 100%
[2:25:30] herzlustafir: as long as ppl watch it will stick around
[2:25:31] Frank4LuLz: streaming is the new TV
[2:25:32] DargieK: i dont because it doesnt provide anything useful or progression to society or the human racce
[2:25:35] inbedwithEd: i think its gunna replace television broadcasts
[2:25:40] McZkittlez: Esports one of the fastest growing industries in the world
[2:25:41] bronswann: whats up
[2:25:42] cptrogers123: Bruh i watch twitch more than regular TV @Towelliee
[2:25:44] DargieK: streaming literally does not provide to society
[2:25:46] Nasilvera: @Frank4LuLz yep
[2:25:46] CrusaderNero: I have followed you since 2011!!!
[2:25:50] raldrik: I think streaming will outlive cable tv
[2:25:52] GodKingMuninn: Streaming will just consantly evolve. The OG streaming was radio and live TV
[2:25:59] Fenixzzz: @bronswann sup
[2:25:59] bronswann: 2012 gang
[2:26:01] Heyhowsitgoingtonight: you're slowing down physically though FeelsOldMan
[2:26:01] Nasilvera: @McZkittlez not really esports is dying
[2:26:07] Derca_: "doesn't provide to society"? who cares KEKW
[2:26:07] moophoria2008: Update your info - says 10 years streaming
[2:26:08] Estralmage: It'll be around until the next technology comes around, but there is nothing yet to replace it so until then it will go forever
[2:26:08] Eshel: @kevindargie  As compared to?
[2:26:14] mavericks312: @kevindargie it provides entertainment
[2:26:17] Molvonos: @kevindargie lmao
[2:26:18] darkladycami: Streaming will be around forever it will just change and involve
[2:26:19] McZkittlez: Fellow Death Jesters member, Been following you since the beginning
[2:26:23] Molvonos: @kevindargie What the fuck is this hot take.
[2:26:26] PatchesMcPatch: Artists DO contribute to society
[2:26:32] Estralmage: It'll be around until the next technology comes around, just like radio to tv, but there is nothing yet to replace it so until then it will go forever
[2:26:33] TheHardcorian: @kevindargie LUL what a stupid take
[2:26:33] ArcaneMaki: It comes down to choice, streaming gives me choice to watch what I want. No way it's going down.
[2:26:35] laeenaravenholdt: @kevindargie lol if that is how you are judging things, neither does Soda, movies, sports....and yeah, he talked faster than I could type
[2:26:38] mavericks312: @kevindargie I found the 60 yr old dude in chat
[2:26:40] McZkittlez: @Nasilvera where you getting that from? Just because there isnt good games doesnt mean the genre is dying globally
[2:26:44] Yagr6: i think he means mic lickers
[2:26:45] darkladycami: @kevindargie that’s a dumb comment LUL
[2:26:47] 3663Sharad: Taxes, a place to go. Streamers do a lot with just being "there"
[2:26:49] MrLongGone: lol how does being a streamer not fall under entertainment, ofcourse it contributes
[2:26:50] DukeBaphomet: its weird someone says live streams dont provide yet there here with an account and watching you
[2:26:53] Jessethoth: Never take up for society, it won't take up for you.
[2:26:57] raldrik: Are you not ENTERTAINED
[2:26:59] Eshel: I’d say providing a space where people can converse openly provides more to society than most other “entertainment”
[2:27:02] Molvonos: Football doesn't contribute anything to society, Comedians don't contribute anything to society.  Entertainment is Entertainment, regardless, always contributes to society.
[2:27:03] Hebi2Cold: I think AI will change streaming, good or bad idk but it will
[2:27:06] Nasilvera: @McZkittlez teams breaking up orgnaizatioins dropping teams
[2:27:06] DargieK: entertainment has no bearing on how well we progress as humans
[2:27:14] GodKingMuninn: @Jessethoth #Anarchy? XD
[2:27:20] Jessethoth: Any job you do is thankless and won't be remembered 100 years from now.
[2:27:24] barefoot_on_bricks: Streaming is a form of entertainment for those of us watching
[2:27:27] mavericks312: @kevindargie bro humans are already fucked stop it
[2:27:33] 91Niki: @kevindargie You have a lot to learn young one
[2:27:37] ZooNamiii: socialization
[2:27:38] Jessethoth: Not at all @GodKingMuninn Just don't suck something off if it won't do it back right?
[2:27:38] veryhairyheyyall: Huh
[2:27:40] Nasilvera: @McZkittlez the fact that most streamers that are big now are variety streamers no one plays just one game anymore
[2:27:43] Molvonos: WE GOT AN ARMCHAIR PSYCHOLOGIST HERE.
[2:27:52] ZooNamiii: socialization is good
[2:27:57] ArcaneMaki: Sure it creates negatives, but it creates a lot of positives as well imho
[2:27:58] TheHardcorian: Your streams have helped me through tough times as a distraction, id say thats a big contribution LUL
[2:28:00] GodKingMuninn: @Jessethoth Hey man, just gotta learn to game the system better.
[2:28:04] Jarlan23: its too early in the morning for conversations like this KEKW
[2:28:05] 91Niki: @kevindargie Then just ignorant :)
[2:28:10] laeenaravenholdt: @Towelliee inventory 8is full
[2:28:10] McZkittlez: @Nasilvera look at games like league of legends and rocket league, even COD, draw in crowds by the masses to watch
[2:28:13] MrLongGone: Hi towelie did you ever think about going into crypto?
[2:28:13] McZkittlez: I disagree
[2:28:18] PatchesMcPatch: Entertainers are a form of artist. artist DO contribute to the phsychological wellbeing of humans
[2:28:24] Jessethoth: Talking about society on the internet is like talking about the internet out in RL society.
[2:28:26] Molvonos: @91Niki Ignorance can be taught, stupidity can't be fixed.  Big difference.

[2:28:52] Eshel: Conversation in streaming provides 100% more to society than smart phones have provided
[2:28:56] GodKingMuninn: @Molvonos This reminds me of a saying a teacher in highschool said. "I can fix stupid, I can't fix lazy."
[2:28:59] HaxzorJimDuggan: they wrote a book about him
[2:29:00] Rob3phones: That walking on water skit gets me every time LUL
[2:29:02] Am3r1c0: Streaming will become more hard pressed to live on when the economy gets so bad that regular people won't be able to afford internet access due to need of food and necessities. Or if WW3 breaks out and all streamers are drafted to "die for their country"
[2:29:09] brazkat: just finished my last mage tower so i have all classes done
[2:29:19] SlumptiiTV: how do you feel about streamers taking handouts from players on hardcore servers
[2:29:20] Jessethoth: @Towelliee My wife told me about a dude that played spoons in the street until he could afford a little mini piano, last time she saw him he was in a suit.

[2:30:31] Milanesa_De_Pollo: EZ
[2:30:32] GodKingMuninn: @Eshel Its so interesting on the viewpoint of stupidity being fixable or not. Suprising amount of philisophic thought has to go into stupidity.
[2:30:43] Jessethoth: @Towelliee People crack me up with that question, as if we wouldn't have accepted it before streaming was a thing.
[2:30:53] darkladycami: I watch streamers to escape the craziness of the world LUL it definitely provides to society lol

[2:32:19] Am3r1c0: @mczkittlez that's not how the draft works. If you are old enough and not on your death bed than you are going to be drafted unless your parents are rich and powerful enough to get you out of it

[3:06:30] tongodono: @bakerbaker019 open back has opening on the headphones which allows you to hear your outside environment and most the the open back creates a larger depth of sounds. usually open back is good for: depth and clarity. Close back is good for: isolation, and higher bass
[3:06:32] Eviltuna13: I think open back means you can hear the outside its not noice canceling
[3:06:38] herzlustafir: DinoDance

[5:58:53] Sollice: If WoW went on Gamepass I would expect a continuing sub fee and perhaps some discounts on services, expansions or exclusive cosmetics
[5:59:05] zysmos: I thought Mike Ybarra said they were making no money on the token
[5:59:06] CloudPants8081: can wow survive when there go free to play? Kappa
[5:59:06] Stiffy84: No need for the token if ya get wow trough GP.
[5:59:44] DunzoCD: KEKW what?
[5:59:45] JQ47: On Twitter at some point
[5:59:47] Sicknessqt: He actually said that ya LUL
[5:59:51] zysmos: He did on twitter
[5:59:51] thegreatdestroyer27607: i buy tokens all the time
[5:59:52] flyingmachin3: maybe they could do 0-20 free on gp
[5:59:56] Draz3nx: token is free money
[6:00:01] Stiffy84: The token pays for so much wow development!
[6:00:02] spookaninja_21: wow token currently goin for 330k
[6:00:04] flyingmachin3: but lock those characters
[6:00:11] kripps_little_wiener: Tokens are very addictive, one month I spend like 300 euro
[6:00:18] CloudPants8081: mike was on xbox before PauseChamp
[6:00:20] Sicknessqt: That would work well with world revamp
[6:00:36] zysmos: A token is more expensive than a month of subscription i don't understand how he can say that imo
[6:00:41] scramperlive: WoW could offer a premium Travelers Log track via Game Pass - Special cosmetics and bonuses only for Game Pass owners

[6:01:15] Alienfromger: every mmo needs fresh blood
[6:01:16] Stiffy84: Id go as far to say the token k8nda helped save wow a little.
[6:01:25] firehawk73: Shadowlands rewamp inc boyz
[6:01:26] Sollice: Revamp old stuff is kind of pointless. They have classic and we want new content
[6:01:31] khrovaa: @Towelliee they should jsut release classic+ and have that be the only WoW added to gamepass lol
[6:01:36] onikid89: no more cata revamps.. not worth
[6:01:39] ShaunsterTheMonster: He knows
[6:01:47] Eshel: But what if I like the polygon trees ?!?!  lol
[6:01:48] jerkchickenpapi: They need to rehaul the game and make a WoW 2
[6:01:49] N3llee: I think they are just going to heal some of the "scars" from cata and do something about the sword.
[6:01:52] JQ47: how much do you know about the next xpac?
[6:02:03] ripshawda3rd: we on to you towelliee
[6:02:05] Ezcotli: They just updating some graphics
[6:02:10] Furinax: DO you know if they are doing a classic +?
[6:02:11] DunzoCD: i like what theyve done with the old stuff, the fog makes the continents feel a bit bigger than when you could see every zone
[6:02:21] Sylphy_TV: Blasted Lands and Badlands needs a little fixer upper
[6:02:29] Stiffy84: WOW 2 is a myth like half life 3
[6:02:35] Xoyzor: is taht true that druids are only vaiable as healers in classic?
[6:02:46] dschmidt: @N3llee what sword? :P
[6:02:47] Sollice: WoW 2

[6:02:52] Sollice: They will eventually make a HL3
[6:03:05] DunzoCD: @Sollice towCopium
[6:03:09] PigPenLen: Ashes wins
[6:03:10] zysmos: A new half life game is more probable
[6:03:22] raldrik: only thing that changes is that I end up not being able to play because it melts my laptop
[6:03:27] Stiffy84: Wow2 looking like wildstar
[6:03:33] Furinax: I need to let wow go back to what it was in Vanilla! plz Blizzard
[6:03:33] HaxzorJimDuggan: i want a WoW expansion to have the abbreviation TWO just to fuck with everyone
[6:03:35] Eshel: Hasn’t WoW2 been “coming” for like a decade now according to some in community ? lol
[6:03:36] Anacydae: I'd like to know what ppl would like wow 2 to be...
[6:03:36] silasrumpkin: silasrumpkin subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 43 months, currently on a 4 month streak! 
[6:03:44] scramperlive: HL3 is going to be the first multi-generational development team game, where entire families worked on it from grandpa to grandson
[6:03:46] zysmos: people just want better graphics
[6:03:52] Kydar: @HaxzorJimDuggan Twilight World Order
[6:03:55] Alienfromger: wow2 would be an overhaul of systems and new engine
[6:04:00] dschmidt: Look at EverQuest2 and all other mmo's that had a sequel with a new client, it didn't end well
[6:04:01] Im_Zookie: Hardcore is to get people used to losing their character
[6:04:09] Noshpan: Only way I can think of a WoW2 is if it's set centuries after a la EQ2
[6:04:21] N3llee: old and outdated
[6:04:21] DunzoCD: i mean the SW portal room only confirms that its gonna be around for awhile
[6:04:24] Stiffy84: Half life 3 will be out before GTA 6
[6:04:25] jerkchickenpapi: World of Warcraft : RELOADED
[6:04:25] N3llee: new tech
[6:04:26] Furinax: They dont need to
[6:04:27] Sollice: but you realize that a new "better graphics engine" wont be as flexible and long term. WoW looks like WoW. It doesnt look like Black Desert
[6:04:29] N3llee: better performance
[6:04:39] Eshel: Yeah - because nothing could possibly go wrong with that kind of data transfer to keep everyone’s characters LMAO
[6:04:50] Bernardo994: I feel they want wow in to look new graphically
[6:04:57] N3llee: cause tech is better surely there would be some cost cutting to
[6:05:02] Furinax: I dont feel like wow is like back  in the day! Looks like a game for Kids
[6:05:12] aladinsane444: Wow 2 should time jump to modern times, so it would be like GTA
[6:05:14] ijuki: Some people have AMD cards though Kappa
[6:05:15] elem3nt_604: wow2 just brings the hype again.
[6:05:15] Bernardo994: The engine is good.. it endured
[6:05:17] abracka_: we're on wow3 at this point
[6:05:21] Darkjoker98: More bits
[6:05:23] demonicyoshi: higher def more detail?
[6:05:25] Nehcrom: Someone chatgpt an answer :P
[6:05:25] Sollice: @Towelliee These people want what they see in those demo UE4 and UE5
[6:05:26] Znza: this game performs well ona toaster now days, literally no need to improve it
[6:05:28] zysmos: WoW is already a technological prowess guys
[6:05:28] N3llee: more 3 sharper more clarity, better lightning
[6:05:28] comp1: I want my cat girls damnit
[6:05:30] Noshpan: New tech & better performance? That can be done with WoW now. I think it's folks complaining that WoW doesn't look realistic.
[6:05:30] JQ47: no way they would want to get rid of the art style.
[6:05:41] Bernardo994: Idk, but I think that's what wow 2 would be
[6:05:41] MrNefarious1: its the same
[6:05:41] sliproach: you press alt f3 with nvidia and make it look amazing
[6:05:46] Sollice: Except those are just demo engines with with NOTHING game related in them
[6:05:46] Stiffy84: It evolves with billions  that aint worth the $
[6:05:49] napur_a: I like to play on high-pop servers, but layering is so bad. Could they fix layering on high-pop realms?
[6:05:56] macleod29: People just bitch about it looking cartoonish and colorful…
[6:05:57] sigilla_: Teldrassil updated aesthetic is 10.2
[6:06:06] Furinax: True
[6:06:08] Stiffy84: Hopium
[6:06:10] robbo1010: so true
[6:06:13] Znza: my first mmo was swtor and i will always compare the 2. game was horribly unoptimized but played nearly identical
[6:06:15] MrNefarious1: that is it right there
[6:06:22] starknadooo: What I expect from a wow2 is better engine so that they can clean up their spaghetti code.
[6:06:25] staticpulsed: then doesnt that make classic wow 2 then
[6:06:25] Znza: it should stay the same lol
[6:06:26] Furinax: But why cant Blizzard make a MMO like Vanilla again?
[6:06:26] Sicknessqt: Legion was wow 2 for me
[6:06:35] abracka_: mfs haven't seen any of the new zones in years, thinking it still looks like 2004
[6:06:40] Eshel: I love the “doesn’t look realistic” argument ….. “my fantasy creature doesn’t look like it does in real life !!” 😝
[6:06:41] aladinsane444: Wow 2 should be VR and should have even more Sylvanas imo
[6:06:44] Stiffy84: 1000% Hopium towCopium towCopium

[6:29:11] formel_4tw: !DEDGE
[6:29:18] wEiRdO_dUdE: It's even worse than guardian druid's tier set, it's that bad
[6:30:03] RageerPLZ: a tier set based on something recast so often, never sounds good, you got split moments where you lose time from the recast alone
[6:30:22] ninetynil: looks like i picked the run tier to pick my paladin back up
[6:30:24] Stiffy84: First thing i did on HC was try to get my hierlooms lol brain fart
[6:30:34] wEiRdO_dUdE: We have the winners with Blood DK and Brewmaster and Vengeance, the losers with Guardians and Prot Paladins, and I'm not sure about Prot Warrior
[6:30:57] xmedpakx: oh no just tuned in and saw you died :(
[6:31:00] Romnus: How is prot warrior looking in retail?
[6:31:06] dschmidt: they running out of good ideas for tier sets. Why not just have tokens drop to up the ilvl? We don't need new tier every new major patch.
[6:31:37] wEiRdO_dUdE: Prot Warrior's tier set seems kind of okay but I haven't heard from those guys if they like it
