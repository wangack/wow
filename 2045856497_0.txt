[0:06:17] NAT0_141: how’s it going @cdewx and chat

[3:38:44] DouzySham: @eepshays there was a SCK exploit one or two years ago, i dont remember the details. Drake used it everytime into wiz and there was just nothing they could do to stop it. In a tournament
[3:38:51] hoaylander: chuck which healer do you favor the most right now?
[3:39:02] shep104: dewLUL dewLUL dewFeels  @SriveMyDoul
[3:39:15] hoaylander: i've been away from the game for a few months
[3:39:16] jaywazere: cdew you gotta honor dump on profession mats
[3:39:19] DouzySham: I think there was
[3:39:26] eepshays: @DouzySham yeh i remember what you mean just didnt know how it was bugged
[3:39:33] jaywazere: more gold this way
[3:39:34] AndyBrinkBrinker: there was, it had to do with storm/earth/fire clone
[3:39:42] eepshays: he would just explode wiz
[3:39:50] whitcomovich: @DouzySham People said Drake cheated? How?
[3:40:41] Zacaree55: Are you guys talking about when SCK would hit full damage into enemies from clones/
[3:40:48] Zacaree55: I dont think that was an exploit/bug
[3:40:54] Zacaree55: That was back in SL s1 yea?
[3:41:35] Zacaree55: Because if you guys remember back then. Trill was clowning fools on WW with SCK stack cleave
[3:41:53] stljay73: are rotation macros "technically" cheating?
[3:42:03] BCboy_: had 4 blood dk shuffle lobbies today and i blame mes for it LULW

[3:44:30] DouzySham: @Zacaree55 found lots of threads from a couple years ago, really looks like it was a bug
[3:44:38] shamebadge: sad
[3:45:53] dooshken: I thought shifting power is supposed to be arcane dmg now? Is that just in pvp?
[3:46:45] dooshken: Ah just arcane for arcane spec?
[3:47:10] dooshken: It does nature dmg still for fire and frost.
[3:47:10] Jcres54: Jcres54 subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 28 months! 
[3:47:23] Zacaree55: @DouzySham When was it though
[3:47:37] DouzySham: I was a big GG fan back then so it made me really dislike Drake for doing that in a tournament lol
[3:47:44] Zacaree55: What season was it?
[3:47:57] DouzySham: @Zacaree55 july 2021 roughly
[3:48:26] Zacaree55: Yeah that was s2 of SL
[3:48:31] Zacaree55: It wasnt a bug exploit
[3:48:40] shamebadge: "July 2021 at 6:52pm, it was 27C outside with a 9mph SE wind, roughly" -DouzySham
[3:48:43] DouzySham: it was definitely on purpose, he did it so many times in a row, exact same strat onto wiz
[3:48:54] Zacaree55: Yeah SCK back then stacked dmg
[3:48:55] Moobot: Follow me! https://twitter.com/cdew_wow https://www.youtube.com/tenderloinx1
[3:48:58] Zacaree55: based on how many targets you hit
[3:49:05] Zacaree55: And Absterge was playing shaman
[3:49:06] Zacaree55: So
[3:49:17] Zacaree55: 6 stack SCK + images did a metric fuck ton of dmg
[3:49:28] omkar3108: PogChamp
[3:49:36] Frostyjoneslol: the clones were getting the chiji buff increasing the SCK damage that was the bug
[3:49:50] hoaylander: fat commune
[3:50:30] hoaylander: chat i've been away for a while, is evoker meta now? what changed?
[3:50:37] DouzySham: There was something about the first tick of SCK not being reduced to 45% for the clones too, it was 100% for all of them
[3:50:37] shamebadge: no
[3:50:56] thothoflau: show mes healing done? lol @cdewx
[3:51:02] exile1619: is holy paladin main stat mastery now? thought it was always crit lol

[3:52:43] Frostyjoneslol: cast sequence macros arent "rotation" macros and a rotation macro is arena would be hella bad cuz if something gets screwed up or something else happens blows up ur cast sequence
[3:53:13] wrogDG: @stljay73 is that the palumor 1shot macro kek
[3:53:48] DouzySham: @Zacaree55 I'm going to go with cdew on this one, he knows more than we do

[4:34:39] mccarley253: what are these new trees like lol
[4:34:44] yakobray: is dragon boomie sub still going well?
[4:35:07] OsyrissTV: the projected hero talents are nutty for Chronoward Evoker
[4:35:14] ll_Meru_ll: maybe they should change the verdant embrace to be usable as a heal while rooted but does not move you
[4:35:29] OsyrissTV: A static DR when hover is active is a nutty thing, idk if that goes live LUL
[4:35:51] stljay73: it isnt about making money from the game, it is about the person recieving something in game for money, because technically all streamers make real money from playing the game
[4:36:33] MakeWayForSanta: do you use OmniCD?
[4:36:35] moldybread00: make verdant embrace give twin guardian
[4:36:39] OsyrissTV: i have killed myself so many times by VEing into the wrong spot in a raid/dungeon

[4:37:33] rembrandt89: blizz wants people to buy tokens for gold boost instead of
[4:37:43] N8lin: pls play some RESTO DRU
[4:37:45] reaperz14: @OsyrissTV Vampiric Embracing?
[4:38:34] wrogDG: hypothetical, if looney was streaming and the people he was boosting just donated to the stream, would that still be rmt?
[4:38:34] Frostyjoneslol: Ur biggest RMT is probably gold buying becuz u can use gold in game to basicly buy everything
[4:38:59] stljay73: @rembrandt89 I remeber in MoP when tokens came out, the forums were overrun with people complaining about being scammed by third parties selling gold
[4:39:15] FoxiekittenWoW: @wrogDG yes, whaazz was talking about some streamer had an offer where you could gift subs to play with them and that was rmt.
[4:39:28] OsyrissTV: @reaperz14 verdant embrace, its the ability all evokers have that "flys" to the target, they can also hit it on themselves and they stand still
[4:39:41] Frostyjoneslol: @wrogDG would it be RMT, most likely, but proving it is the hard part
[4:39:47] wrogDG: @FoxiekittenWoW good info thanks
[4:39:47] Bierce_IV: blizz cares too much about a shrinking PVP player pool
[4:40:04] FoxiekittenWoW: @wrogDG but its hard to prove i guess
[4:40:22] rembrandt89: @stljay73 lol sounds bout right
[4:40:23] Frostyjoneslol: @Bierce_IV has 0 to do with pvp, has everything to do with if u enforce it in one area u enforce it in all areas
[4:40:30] OsyrissTV: pvp will hopefully feel good in the war within after the stat squish

[4:46:37] LillJ98: hi @cdewx wanna share Omnicd settings? :) or can i find it anywhere?
[4:47:00] DizziestShot: I also don't think stat squish would matter, the numbers would just be smaller
[4:47:00] LillJ98: ok :)
[4:47:03] lustevit: he said “can’t even beat me playing the most op comp”
[4:47:13] boocraft1992: I'd delete the rogue class if I could lol. Most annoying class ever with a 20 SECOND COOLDOWN undispellable stun. It's just so broken imo
[4:47:23] Zerolol123: @lustevit spreading drama for what LUL
[4:47:24] lustevit: can’t even win*

[4:56:05] stljay73: I agree with Max, he always says, you will always play your main better than switching to any meta class, unless it is dogshit, the best multiclasser still never play the most optimal than thier main
