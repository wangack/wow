[0:26:50] TenWin: In response to your Player housing video... One of WoW's largest strengths is the class fantasy. Very distinct, very clear. And I believe FIRMLY, that it would be a major mistake for Blizzard to just have a basic "flat" or standardized housing. As it would clash with so many characters. Like, A DK owning a random flat in Stormwind? A Blood elf in an orcish hut? Nah, it just doesn't work.
[0:26:50] stewart1957: You don't boil cream eggs :-)

[0:36:39] Deatheran: @TaliesinAndEvitel blizz dropping a casual reminder more retail content comming in "the coming weeks" feels so long away.
[0:36:41] RosieSeren: I think it originally looked like the mount was the reward and it appears they have switched them
[0:36:46] FatCatDad48: 999 means log rewards

[0:38:30] neverbornlucky: Taliesin but the 35 portal diablo4 package is just a portal package
[0:38:40] GingerBear30: I don't think you can get that mount any other way though, which is kinda garbage.
[0:38:44] apheelia96: NO I want it
[0:38:44] Nulgar: McDonalds sells straws for 3 bucks a piece (in a bundle with a large Coke)
[0:38:45] NightMunchies: 90$ mouse pad screw that
[0:38:55] Durwen: And the brutosaur was what, 250 dollars in tokens?
[0:38:57] TenWin: @TaliesinAndEvitel Print "Supreme" on the mousepad and you 100% could sell a 90$ mousepad to a bunch of morons
[0:38:59] rei__03: LUL

[0:39:02] squarepusher_: LUL

[0:39:09] bomayaa: Asmon diss - check  :D
[0:39:11] Xenos_Peregrine: tbh, the best part of the shadowlands deluxe pack was the mount
[0:39:14] NightMunchies: hope they throw in that AH mount
[0:39:16] TankenFunk: Can't believe I just paid $30 for an etiquette... Sure, it was attached to a bottle of wine, but you know..
[0:39:25] pricklefoxgaming: 10milion children and MAGA suporters
[0:39:53] neverbornlucky: yes
[0:39:56] grumpy_dan: 4
[0:39:56] Triskelian: So you've lost patience with Asmon... again? :D

[0:40:01] djalminnha: y

[0:40:11] backflash69: Player housing video was dope, I really do hope we'll get something that refined
[0:40:20] Feisti718: the portals cost the same at last epoch
[0:40:26] doomer_dan_: 70 dollar game**
[0:40:32] LechoSoup: The real Diablo 4 was the Grim Dawn and Last Epoch we made along the way
[0:40:34] RosieSeren: Yeah the house video was really good! really enjoyed
[0:40:40] rei__03: last epoch is Pog
[0:40:41] GingerBear30: Last Epoch is a blast
[0:40:45] atamala: i like it
[0:40:56] pricklefoxgaming: EEEEpoch
[0:40:59] rei__03: the video was awesome
[0:40:59] LolitaAldea: I love it
[0:41:09] bomayaa: yeah I really liked the house video - might have to watch it again as I had it on in the background
[0:41:11] atamala: I really want older crafting materials to become useful in some capacity
[0:41:12] netonkent: Wasn't expecting another video this week I was so happy 💙
[0:41:29] AlanC2024: drinking coffee i asume in the video :)
[0:41:30] Durwen: The coffee mug was a bit on the nose
[0:41:43] neverbornlucky: Taliesin it was either get 35 reskin portal package or last epoch I picked last epoch a full game over reskin
[0:41:43] atamala: yep exactly, spot on
[0:41:43] TenWin: @TaliesinAndEvitel Honestly, one of the reasons I am so 100% against the concept of "World of warcraft 2". Because WoW, as it is right now essentially has a form of "protection". It is old, it has a huge fanbase, and changing the monetization too much would hurt the playerbase, and the dev team can easily argue that. IF however we got WOW2, it would not have the same defense, as it would build up its own playerbase... and you know there would be an ESO shop.
[0:41:59] ArcaneSyntax: Josh Strife Hayes? The guy that covers all mmos except for world of Warcraft?
[0:42:00] XedL: Player housing bookcase you can deposit all your readable items in! Opens up like a collection.
[0:42:35] Sinashira: Dark Pathways pacl is just 5 differnt town portal skins?.... Wuut?
[0:42:35] AlanC2024: In the video I Ioved how you were putting toys in the valdrakken inn to show how it might be like :)
[0:43:01] Arlaeya: Was getting up for coffee and sat right back down hearing "library tab."
[0:43:06] GammaHeadsTV: ***
[0:43:08] ArcaneSyntax: Do the town portals look cool
[0:43:08] GammaHeadsTV: There ya go!
[0:43:17] TankenFunk: That's just like me and Bezos having a joint net worth of like 200 billions
[0:43:40] MilkEggsFabricSoftener: and class bound
[0:43:43] pricklefoxgaming: just reskins!!!
[0:43:44] pricklefoxgaming: HAHAHAHA

[0:44:00] saarkhastick: Some look more swirly while others look more smokey.
[0:44:09] GammaHeadsTV: Go-Go-Portal Rangerrrssss
[0:44:20] TenWin: It just changes the townportal animation
[0:44:20] Sinashira: No wininng it's just townportal
[0:44:27] Nulgar: @TankenFunk hey, me and Bezos have the same joint net worth... that dude must be broke as fuck, he doesn't even register in the sum
[0:44:33] pricklefoxgaming: everyone gets a portal button
[0:44:37] KaisenSiru: anniesHYPERS
[0:44:38] ArcaneSyntax: The free battle pass also has portal skins
[0:44:39] Nulgar: *too
[0:44:47] pricklefoxgaming: you get a portal button, you get a portal button, YOU get a portal button
[0:44:50] LechoSoup: Whenever I play D4, I'm always thinking "Man, this would be so much more enjoyable if my town portal was yellow"
[0:45:20] j4ck4lop3: j4ck4lop3 subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 28 months! tneComradeTal
[0:45:30] TankenFunk: @Nulgar Yeah we should probably stop hanging out with him now then Kappa
[0:45:31] neverbornlucky: Taliesin if they pull this off in diablo4 how soon till WOW portal reskin store coming soon
[0:45:42] ArcaneSyntax: It's like 10$?
[0:45:50] Saevash: Heyoooo
[0:45:52] TenWin: @neverbornlucky Most likely never.
[0:45:54] caradosailanthus: Can you earn the coins in game without real money?
[0:46:03] TenWin: @caradosailanthus No
[0:46:12] drynoor: if you get the battle pass it gives you 6-700 over the season
[0:46:18] ArcaneSyntax: No, the paid battle has some but not that much
[0:46:22] atamala: the battlepass gives you like 333 or something, which isn't enough to buy the next battlepass
[0:46:41] phemii: shouldnt be a promotion and announcement for something today?
[0:46:44] KaisenSiru: anniesWrite devoNOTE
[0:46:45] ArcaneSyntax: 1000 is $10
[0:46:46] TankenFunk: How much does 1000 plat cost by itself?
[0:46:47] pricklefoxgaming: wasnt blizzard suppose to be getting less greedy?
[0:46:47] TenWin: So it is more like... 12 bucks for 5 portal skins
[0:47:13] Nontus135: People buy it or they wouldn't sell it.
[0:47:14] neverbornlucky: Taliesin coming to a wow microstore soon
[0:47:18] TankenFunk: I blame all those WOKE companies Kappa Obviously, the radical left is to blame for this. I am very smart
[0:47:18] 0PlaZma0: @TenWin But then you're lumped with 1k platinum and I assume everything costs 995 platinum or something
[0:47:34] drynoor: 1000 platinum is a season pass so you're effectively buying the portals and a season pass
[0:47:39] grumpy_dan: Tali! Since you are designing WoW housing. Check out New World's instanced housing in towns when you get a chance to. Trust
[0:47:42] pricklefoxgaming: more expensive than a sick squid
[0:47:43] ArcaneSyntax: I don't recommend people buy it
[0:47:50] TenWin: Yeah, the Diablo store is bad, don't get me wrong... but a LOT of people love to overreact to the extreme of costs and prices
[0:47:54] KaisenSiru: D4 Pog
[0:47:56] brennibrennt: It is somewhat pitiful, but many other games do it to, and you don't have to buy it.
[0:47:59] djalminnha: the problem is that can start epidemic on other games
[0:48:01] neverbornlucky: Taliesin look at the 65 dollar horse package
[0:48:14] kiljoy102: D4 is a fine game but man last epoch and PoE are there and way better value
[0:48:16] Nulgar: @atamala I like the Rocket League "Rocket Pass", the premium track costs 1000 credits, but you also earn 1000 credits from it, so by paying it once, I financed all later passes
[0:48:17] Dazzaw17: why feel sorry for diablo players? we have last epoch now alls good ;)
[0:48:24] FelPlague: I have no use for 7k platinum, bvut I fucking love that horse, and it sucks ass I HAVE to if I want that horse
[0:48:29] Nulgar: not even the Epic Fail Games takeover could destroy that
[0:48:29] theszoti: the worst thing, the game itself isn't even that bad, but they just keep making bad decisions since the game launched
[0:48:39] doomer_dan_: It's okay, we Diablo fans still have the only true Diablo 2 successor- D2 Resurrected
[0:48:40] pricklefoxgaming: not THAT cool
[0:48:45] Durwen: When I bought diablo iv I was very happy until patch 1 hit. I haven't touched it in months.
[0:48:45] ArcaneSyntax: 7000 plat is kind of a lot
[0:48:49] AlanC2024: be great if mage portals had different effects around them but tie it to a questline / collectables like warlock per customisations or trading post
[0:48:52] TenWin: @theszoti I would argue the game is great. The campaign alone (IMO) is a great play if you can get it for like 40-50 bucks
[0:49:13] FelPlague: the horse is free, 7k is about that much
[0:49:15] Nulgar: @theszoti just sounds like standard battlepass tactics that have been prevalent in other games for years
[0:49:20] SinicalDev: Bundling it is the predatory bit
[0:49:25] brennibrennt: I mean, the house + currency is not that different like the flower transmog + tender Kappa
[0:49:27] drynoor: With D4 I don't mind them having stuff like this, if people want to buy it then so be it but the lack of transmogs being added to the base game for free is bad
[0:49:33] djalminnha: 55
[0:49:39] NightMunchies: holy thats high
[0:49:46] TenWin: It is like the freaking corsage bundle
[0:49:47] pricklefoxgaming: may aswell sell the house if i keep buying these bundles.
[0:50:05] FelPlague: @TaliesinAndEvitel the horse is free, the platinum is about the same, you can tell by getting the 5700 and adding the 1000 and about 500.
[0:50:08] TenWin: The Wow corsage bundle? that was a corage and 250 tendies?
[0:50:26] bucephalos: hearthstone :X
[0:50:53] kiljoy102: @TaliesinAndEvitel the big thing is the class sets in D4, the gear you find in the game looks very generic, the paid stuff looks cool
[0:50:55] FelPlague: I was fine with d4 having a shop, but the insane amount of stuff they have added ot the shop, and how expensive they are? its actually just insane.
[0:51:06] 0PlaZma0: Do you reckon they'll bring tendies in when they reach Dragonflight classic LUL
[0:51:20] TenWin: Sure... but the game is still really good (IMO) which is a tad sad
[0:51:28] brennibrennt: Modern service games, wow is from another era
[0:51:29] FelPlague: If they had like 3  sets per class sure. But they have more sets in the shop then ingame.
[0:51:39] theszoti: the game is 70 (!!!) euros, and they keep pushing you to buy a battlepass for 10 euros every 3 month and also this predatory shop exists, which they keep putting in front of your face on battlenet
[0:51:40] Saevash: @TaliesinAndEvitel i guess they feel like they have more leeway cause the game is brand new and it was built this way. Exactly what you are saying Myff
[0:51:41] NightMunchies: prices are pretty high
[0:51:47] pricklefoxgaming: @0PlaZma0 Drgonflight classic is like 20 years away
[0:52:02] doomer_dan_: good is a bit generous. d4 is very mid
[0:52:11] netonkent: Have been trading post? I'm all out  of tendies again haha
[0:52:14] databob1: Made to sell toys it the mantra of 5he 80s
[0:52:21] 0PlaZma0: @pricklefoxgaming that's why we need the opinion now
[0:52:21] neverbornlucky: Taliesin they have to milk those xbox game pass people somehow
[0:52:28] spooky_seraph: Recently in Call of Duty the whole game broke, and the store page was the first thing they fixed - I feel the same would happen here
[0:52:40] Nulgar: Yeah, let's move on to the Trading Post, am interested in what Tali thinks about that, while I'm still in the office
[0:52:52] drynoor: 3 shit sets in the basic battle pass is all they've added since launch, that is the real problem
[0:52:58] TankenFunk: Been playing Helldivers 2 recently, and honestly, (as of about a month into the game), it is very consumer friendly
[0:53:04] TankenFunk: Which was a nice surprise
[0:53:23] The_Action_Man: Starship Troopers: The Game LUL
[0:53:25] TenWin: Mission based co-op shooter with missions
[0:53:25] Qelvue: it's awesome
[0:53:27] doomer_dan_: it's like a pve mission based extraction game
[0:53:27] lreddenn: bugs
[0:53:28] kiljoy102: It made people think starship troopers wasnt satires
[0:53:30] pricklefoxgaming: shoot em up
[0:53:32] kiljoy102: satire*
[0:53:35] pricklefoxgaming: grindy shoot em up
[0:53:37] 0PlaZma0: It's a 3rd person coop shooter, drop in, do mission, back out
[0:53:39] oddwafer: third person shooter
[0:53:40] Qelvue: starship troopers coop
[0:53:41] NightMunchies: shoot em up game
[0:53:41] TankenFunk: It's a squad shooter, so Vermintide-y yeah
[0:53:44] wanik90: Its an rts but youre playing a grunt
[0:53:45] XedL: Squad based coop shooter
[0:53:47] Sorin__: Yeah close to dark tide, but 3rd person
[0:53:51] venomcode85: like gears of war
[0:53:59] Alonarius: More like Left4Dead
[0:53:59] NightMunchies: like GOW
[0:54:00] XedL: Similar, but third person
[0:54:10] adleydarling: o/ good moring tali and chat
[0:54:20] brennibrennt: On the fifth anniversary, tali randomly decided to become a creator for Helldivers 2
[0:54:26] KaisenSiru: anniesGasp
[0:54:37] pricklefoxgaming: Thats exactly what last epoch is doing at the moment, so many bugs and chrashes
[0:55:06] DragnosiOfNede: @TaliesinAndEvitel  - Responded to your DM.
[0:55:12] NightMunchies: Alot of crashes and bugs
[0:55:24] AlanC2024: its starship troopers and terminator in one. Whats not to like
[0:55:25] neverbornlucky: Taliesin but you too can smell like Donald Trump
[0:55:26] ArcaneSyntax: Helldivers is even more overt
[0:55:31] TankenFunk: It's also very obvious satire of US warfare (in space), and I love seeing people seethe over it
[0:55:32] Lenitas: Bit of a self report
[0:55:35] 0PlaZma0: Fucking PRONOUNS!!
[0:55:35] lil_doreo: Helldivers 2 is my favorite game i don't own
[0:55:40] Qelvue: have you seen the trailer for it?
[0:55:41] Thallex: cause theyre no fun! its hilarious
[0:55:45] kiljoy102: @TaliesinAndEvitel next thing youll tell me 40k is satire too
[0:55:46] FelPlague: Bro I was playing Helldivers yesterday and met someone who thought the game was just uniroincally like that.
[0:55:50] kiljoy102: OMG POLITICS
[0:55:52] Feisti718: the writers for helldivers have a good sense of humor the banter is funny
[0:56:03] databob1: @taliesinandevitel BG3 has eaten my soul
[0:56:05] XedL: They've threaded the needle so well in making sure that the friendly fire in that game is hilarious rather than irritating.
[0:56:09] pricklefoxgaming: for the emperor!
[0:56:17] venomcode85: I’m doing my part !!!
[0:56:19] The_Action_Man: I played it and had no issues last week
[0:56:23] FelPlague: @TaliesinAndEvitel nope, the "buggy" was just so many insane amount of people
[0:56:28] ArcaneSyntax: You fight lots of bugs
[0:56:29] wanik90: I havnt had any bugs in it, just queue times
[0:56:29] Feisti718: Gothalion has been plaing for like 3 weeks straigh. it seems good
[0:56:32] TankenFunk: Some of the systems are a bit buggy, but game play is not that bugged really
[0:56:32] doomer_dan_: nah it wasn't super buggy, they just had server capacity issues, which are solved now
[0:56:36] AlanC2024: the ceo for Helldivers is a chad
[0:56:37] ramzie0: Happy Partner-versary!
[0:56:40] Sorin__: I had to set up a frame cap cos it was running at 300 fps
[0:56:54] XedL: The server issues have calmed down - there's still the odd bug but it's very managable
[0:56:57] TenWin: Regarding your Player housing video. I have to argue that WoW really shouldn't have "standardized" housing. It wouldnt' fit so many characters.  Like, DK in a stormwind flat, or a blood elf in an Orc hut. IMO, (despite how unrealistic it is) it would be the best for WoW if rather than having standard homes, would it be the player crafting their own home, out of assets / instance aspects of the game. As it would make it possible to build a home that fits "your character".
[0:57:07] KaisenSiru: Trading Post Pog
[0:57:12] TankenFunk: Speaking of, gonna go play Helldivers now, see ya friends! tneEviHeart
[0:57:17] Alonarius: People are gonna be like how Patrick Bateman became glorified, missing the point. We're gonna be 'wooo go democracy' I swear
[0:57:17] XedL: "Helldivers." "Relaxing." :D
[0:57:29] NightMunchies: trading post has nice stuff
[0:57:30] Qelvue: they had to limit the server capacity and are gradually increaing it, because their concurrent player numbers are high as hell even though it's on xbox as well.
[0:57:36] XedL: @TankenFunk FOR DEMOCRACY o7
[0:57:44] cyclopsnerd: ideally we have many home options
[0:57:45] TankenFunk: o7
[0:58:23] SinicalDev: cant wait for the landlord mission table
[0:58:26] Alonarius: Let's go, you Monkeys, would you like to never die?!
[0:58:29] pricklefoxgaming: a furniture tab
[0:58:40] pricklefoxgaming: thats filled with items like how the mount tab works
[0:58:41] DragnosiOfNede: Bugger that, Want to Buy Complete Custom housing ala Star Wars Galaxies.  Lets surround Stormwind with Troll hut homes and starve them out!
[0:58:42] Durwen: I'd rather have just the one, if I'm honest.
[0:58:47] d3adpixell: bigger on the inside like tardis
[0:58:48] grimblymcgoo: isnt this a little too close to garrisons? werent people asking for more customizations and not just the "cookie cutter" choices
[0:58:48] databob1: My dwarf monk already had a home in the dalarn beer garden
[0:59:12] TenWin: I would just want a system where I could build a house like waycrest manor with a dungeon underneath that is a secret lab, or whatever...
[0:59:14] 0PlaZma0: Collecting houses == landlord rp
[0:59:23] ArcaneSyntax: As long as they don't copy FFXIVs housing.
[0:59:29] Metket: %00.5 chance from love is in the air boss to get manuscript for a bed with hearts on it Pog
[0:59:32] Durwen: Nah, I'd like it to be a bit like the Animal Crossing homes. You buy it, and upgrade it
[0:59:35] Qelvue: @TaliesinAndEvitel ever played Tibia? an mmorpg from 1997 that still has a community and updates, they've had really good housing for over 25 years xD
[0:59:42] netonkent: Omg same I finished at 2 am haha
[1:00:01] pricklefoxgaming: I just want it
[1:00:02] neverbornlucky: Taliesin Tendies in wow store is the future of what diablo4 store is
[1:00:17] ramzie0: @Metket you misplaced the decimal. It was 0.05% for the manuscript sadge
[1:00:47] cyclopsnerd: you can buy that one on the AH
[1:00:50] grimblymcgoo: @TaliesinAndEvitel Do you know what the stars are in the calendar? I thought it was the hearthstone event but it is different days
[1:00:57] databob1: kraken194CanaryPanic1 = community reaction
[1:01:00] cyclopsnerd: date simulator module I think
[1:01:01] NightMunchies: sunset toy
[1:01:01] Metket: @ramzie0 i got so irritiated while typing it so made a mistake LUL
[1:01:07] Titannborn: is the peacock 🦚 that’s mount
[1:01:11] 0PlaZma0: did you come across lotro player housing in your vid research? basically ffxiv housing but it's the first MMO i played with it and it was so cool
[1:01:12] Bain6969: imagine Blizz combined player housing with new professions like masonry or lumbering?
[1:01:13] ramzie0: @Metket haha, I feel you
[1:01:13] dwolf010: @TaliesinAndEvitel the D4 devs did say yseterday that they have heard the store feedback and there will be changes to make i tless. (just like the OW devs said)
[1:01:15] Titannborn: the mount this month
[1:01:19] Travnar: @TaliesinAndEvitel get it, its bis
[1:01:20] Travnar: thats it
[1:01:22] Saiyori: I bought 30 of those from the vendor to sell througout the year XD
[1:01:24] bomayaa: yeah More than one setting Tali easiy worth it
[1:01:24] NightMunchies: 8k
[1:01:31] neverbornlucky: Taliesin should I convert all my wow gold into wow token to get that 65 diablo4 horse ?
[1:01:35] NightMunchies: thats alot
[1:01:42] Travnar: not really
[1:01:45] Travnar: gotta stay
[1:01:53] bomayaa: I never moved
[1:01:56] NightMunchies: no bud
[1:01:57] KeyouiX: It has a border
[1:01:57] Dark_Lady_Looshkin: it's like the other toys that affect the area
[1:01:58] Travnar: its still really good
[1:02:04] NightMunchies: not for 8k
[1:02:06] Travnar: the starry night is soo good
[1:02:07] bomayaa: I like the firefly option
[1:02:11] ivashkov92: I didn’t know there was a toy for that lol
[1:02:11] Saevash: @TaliesinAndEvitel there is also another similar toy that makes the game sunny called "jar of sunwarmed sand" that you can buy in the caverns of time for timewarped badges
[1:02:18] pricklefoxgaming: JAR OF SUNWARMED SAND
[1:02:19] Saiyori: write it off as a business expense
[1:02:20] pricklefoxgaming: woops
[1:02:22] pricklefoxgaming: caps
[1:02:30] NightMunchies: omg u bought it 8k
[1:02:54] KaisenSiru: I love the rain one
[1:02:56] Travnar: @TaliesinAndEvitel fireflies at night is incredible
[1:03:04] KaisenSiru: A real rain storm
[1:03:14] NightMunchies: wierd toy
[1:03:18] cyclopsnerd: yeah :(
[1:03:30] Saevash: @TaliesinAndEvitel try looking for the jar of sunwarmed sand bud it's prob what you looking for
[1:03:31] apheelia96: 
[1:03:33] DiscordianKitty: what is this?
[1:03:45] PizzaPixie: you could put it on top of a building in stormwind
[1:03:47] Travnar: Do the fire flies
[1:03:48] Nulgar: It should apply a buff with a duration
[1:03:50] NightMunchies: some toy that controls the weather

[1:19:27] SinicalDev: Americans have whiter teeth but per capita they have worse dental hygiene

[1:23:00] caradosailanthus: I got veneers on my two top front teeth as a late teenagers.  I think I fell and hit my mouth and it caused them to discolor for some reason.  I don't really remember.
[1:23:00] Yurimooo: Hey sorry I just joined the stream, is the reason you took down the podcast you guy posted yesterday on YouTube?

[1:24:41] Yurimooo: THANK YOU <3
[1:24:47] Rugmanimus: Ronnie Ortiz-Magro from The Jersey Shore is a perfect example of how ridiculous fake teeth look when they are super straight and extra white
[1:24:49] Nulgar: and why did you delete the Twitch VoD? I missed a good chunk of it, can't watch it back yet
[1:24:58] Lenitas: Last week I was late so I was watching at a delay and it got taken down before I finished which really sucked xD
[1:25:15] ivashkov92: Ya, Dan Olson on the podcast! was a fun one

[1:38:41] OatsMate: Glad I'm not the only one thinking it.
[1:38:44] shren__: it looks copper green

[1:38:46] handovdoom666: ALSO BLIZ IS APPROPRIATING MY HERITAGE FOR ILL GOTTEN GAINS
[1:39:03] ivashkov92: I was hoping for something St. paddy’s themed - some kind of clover thing or something ☘️

[1:39:54] Thenriik: Can i just say...this month is supposed to be 10.2.6..and there is a lot of Aquatic stuff in the post wolfsTHINK
[1:39:55] ivashkov92: Ya, purple cloak will have to purchase separately on a different month 😆

[1:40:05] StingerPlaysGames: Great player housing video, can we have a video for dyes.... >.> its something that i have wanted for a very long time.... and sadly i doubt we will ever get it

[1:40:12] Saiyori: there's a couple of DF cloaks it /kinda/ works with but I'm struggling to match it too
[1:40:26] gabekan: "Fucking bullshit. How much? Hmm."
[1:40:42] Deatheran: @TaliesinAndEvitel does it match the medive hood and cloak from the trading post a while ago?
[1:40:44] FelPlague: 15 year aniversary
[1:40:46] ARogueAI: Hey Talie no shade, but I was going through some of your old videos and saw your one on the AP for cosmetics. I'm pretty sure what you suggested was basically just time walking. Love the content though!

[1:41:56] Saiyori: the mount is fantastic
[1:41:57] grimblymcgoo: the mount flying is beautiful
[1:42:03] KaisenSiru: anniesCute
[1:42:12] Atomicpanda: they celebrated the 15th anniversary by putting those mounts in the cash shop tneDorkthyr
[1:42:16] Nulgar: If you don't want the box, can I have it? :)
[1:42:23] Majustea: this is the first shop I'll buy the mount I think
[1:42:42] dotonbori: Is this just like the Venthyr one?
[1:42:53] butlerlog: bind it to jump and be a discount demonhunter
[1:42:55] Fibnkak: I'm Mary Poppins Y'all
[1:43:00] grimblymcgoo: can you show us the /mountspecial with the peafowl?
[1:43:02] dotonbori: I think it's just a green version of that
[1:43:04] Nerzalus: you can always refund it
[1:43:11] Majustea: yeah, though it is just a matter of time until they nerf the cooldown- but itll be nice until then!
[1:43:30] sterlz_the_ok: Its gotta just be like the shadowlands parasol right?
[1:43:36] Phenroi: Just a reskin of the Venthyr umbrella
[1:43:36] Xenos_Peregrine: thats not flying, it's falling with style
[1:43:37] cinnatoasto_: Is it possible to script it? if you are not on a mount, always have the parasol toy up
[1:44:04] Dark_Lady_Looshkin: parasol can be used whilst mounted
[1:44:13] cinnatoasto_: I can tell you that the mount special is not special
[1:44:14] Atomicpanda: sure it goes away in combat
[1:44:17] neverbornlucky: taliesin when is long boy moving to the t trading post
[1:44:18] ShadowDragon14855: happy partner anniversary!
[1:44:24] FelPlague: parasol

[1:44:38] darth_nykal: fowl
[1:44:38] Nerzalus: peafowl i thin
[1:44:40] butlerlog: majestic
[1:44:42] KaisenSiru: peafowl
[1:44:55] Atomicpanda: i'm not sure. i'm just assuming it's the same as the ventthyr umbrellas.
[1:44:58] KaisenSiru: its huge!
[1:45:01] Majustea: Majestic??? Thats my mount! majust1Yep
[1:45:06] Saiyori: listen to the sound it makes when you summon it
[1:45:14] grimblymcgoo: eh
[1:45:18] butlerlog: its wings curve ever so slightly forward which is cool
[1:45:20] Lenitas: Could be worse
[1:45:22] Sch1ey: The noise when you get on could be louder Peacocks are loud af
[1:45:24] cinnatoasto_: told you
[1:45:27] mattyxoqt: Still a really nice mount
[1:45:29] emi_nya_hime: i wish it would fan our the tailfeathers
[1:45:30] Atomicpanda: mount"special"
[1:45:33] FelPlague: Could be worse. Could be better.
[1:45:35] Majustea: I wanted it to spread its tailfeathers!!
[1:45:39] Merex760: The fancy mount specials are $25
[1:45:42] Nulgar: 14 billion years frogmu1Heart
[1:45:46] OatsMate: Does it fly?
[1:45:51] FelPlague: OMFG IT DOES THE HEAD WOBBLE
[1:45:55] FelPlague: IT USES THE DUCK SKIN
[1:45:58] FelPlague: er duck skeleton
[1:45:59] Starclassics: literally just taking mounts from ffxiv
[1:46:06] FelPlague: it has the duck head wobble idle animation
[1:46:08] Nerzalus: fancy tailfeather spread with the wings woulda looked way cooler
[1:46:12] Saiyori: I think it shares model with the MoP phoenixes
[1:46:13] mattyxoqt: its got a nice running animation
[1:46:16] OatsMate: Well of course it doesn't dragonride, it's a bird.
[1:46:16] bucephalos: nice glow effect
[1:46:23] ivashkov92: haha
[1:46:25] Starclassics: same design and glow effects
[1:46:29] butlerlog: the only mount i had in ff14 was a peacock mount you rode sidesaddle on and could spread its tail, was cute af
[1:46:31] lreddenn: sounds fake
[1:46:33] Elrathir: wait peacocks are real???
[1:46:34] Thoreya: always that one FF person LUL
[1:46:35] mewpoke_: ff14 invented peacocks you shill
[1:46:35] grumpy_dan: NO! we invented peacocks!!!
[1:46:39] neverbornlucky: Taliesin when do we get a gnome High chair
[1:46:42] OatsMate: Stealing the concept of sparkles and the color blue from FF14 LUL
[1:46:46] teddyg55: false FFXIV invented the idea of mounts in video games
[1:46:50] Alonarius: FFXIV devs genetically engineered peacocks long ago
[1:46:53] gabekan: Nope. Peacocks came in World patch 2.0.22 Kappa
[1:46:54] Deatheran: i wish there werre side saddle mounts
[1:46:57] FelPlague: @Starclassics bro I am looking at the ff14 peacock mount and it looks literally nothing alike
[1:47:03] Atomicpanda: you don't look like miss remembering
[1:47:05] ivashkov92: haha
[1:47:06] Elrathir: the P in YoshiP is for Peacock
[1:47:07] Kshantos: does it have a mount special
[1:47:18] bucephalos: there were peacocks in wod
[1:47:20] Nulgar: Anime fans against thinking Anime invented animals
[1:47:34] sterlz_the_ok: a flourish of the plumes
[1:47:36] Kshantos: close
[1:47:45] databob1: FFXIV invented  paecocks??? What did I see as a child?
[1:47:50] OatsMate: There are a lot of people who call Yoshi P the reason FFXIV is bad.
[1:47:55] FelPlague: @TaliesinAndEvitel it uses the duck skeleton, you can tell caused the head wobble idle animation.
[1:47:56] Majustea: mounts were actually invented by square enix! and animals! and saddles!
[1:47:58] dotonbori: The skytalon same model one has an incredible Mount special too :(
[1:48:05] KaisenSiru: it uses the Zereth Mortis skeleton raptor mounts yea
[1:48:22] grimblymcgoo: its a reused animation. i think the pteradax or however you spell that
[1:48:31] Atomicpanda: how close can i get it in the time they're lettimg me make it
[1:48:38] ivashkov92: How much was mount?
[1:48:40] neverbornlucky: Taliesin I thought all guys had PCock mounts to start with in their pants
[1:48:40] dotonbori: It uses a skeleton from the Zereth Motris birds
[1:48:45] databob1: Where's our duck mount
[1:48:47] FelPlague: @grimblymcgoo nah that is very differewnt skeleton.
[1:48:49] McScooterson: the zm birbs have great flight animation
[1:48:49] Fibnkak: If it walks like a duck and talks like a peacock. run because that bird will be mean AF
[1:49:04] FelPlague: btw yeah where the heck is our duck mount and big centaur doggo mounts?
[1:49:05] dotonbori: My 3D printed birds >:O
[1:49:05] Deatheran: D: those are good birbs
[1:49:14] PicarusLoL: wow those are pretty birdos
[1:49:21] Majustea: oh itll be a sick DF mount
[1:49:25] KaisenSiru: Still waiting for the a Bakar mount
[1:49:31] grumpy_dan: its actually a drug deal
[1:49:37] grumpy_dan: using date as a cover
[1:49:39] OatsMate: Do you think boats will have dragonriding?
[1:49:39] Atomicpanda: just blizz giving us the bird
[1:49:43] Deatheran: aint nothing wrong with 2 dudes on a romatic date. thats cute AF
[1:49:49] Majustea: awww I'm gonna lay in the street for them <3
[1:49:54] RadioactiveBullfrog: RadioactiveBullfrog subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 2 months! radioa2Love
[1:50:06] jmalmin: So War within is dead now? is that a thing? Still going to play it and enjoy it.
[1:50:23] TenWin: I am still waiting for that freaking Nerubian mount... (As a reminder for when that vote was made, and they have said that the other mounts would still be added to the game, and one of them was a nerubian if I remember right)
[1:50:27] Atomicpanda: you have to fall a long-ish way for it to slow fall
[1:50:44] ivashkov92: It won’t break the expansion by any means
[1:50:52] apheelia96: I dont know why they are mad.
[1:50:54] Thoreya: i feell like its more content creators telling everyone to hate them
[1:50:55] Deatheran: why tho? literaly the 2 that are shit im prety sure blizz has commited to reworking them
[1:50:59] databob1: It's dead? Thank goodness we avoided a war
[1:50:59] Thoreya: rather than people actually hating it
[1:51:02] jmalmin: At level 10 you choose between 3 specs to play. No difference with the hero talents. :) I am just amused.
[1:51:07] butlerlog: they'll fix the bad ones and they'll be FINE, just not what i would have liked more
[1:51:13] Durwen: standard prepatch anticipation fare, I think. Find something to be mad about, and farm it. Pull the Ripcord anyone?
[1:51:13] ivashkov92: they will be changed quite a bit before release and during the games lifecycle
[1:51:17] Thugis123: how do u get that chicken?
[1:51:17] sterlz_the_ok: lolol
[1:51:18] LolitaAldea: they are just talents and thats a bit boring
[1:51:23] OatsMate: The game is making clickbait, and Asmongoloid clip channels are winning
[1:51:26] darth_nykal: @TenWin Nerubian wasnt an option, they were the tree, jello cat, and the book, theyve all been added
[1:51:26] eyeoin: just seems needlessly convoluted.
[1:51:29] Alonarius: I've been bored of my troll warrior main all DF, switching slowly to paladin - but if I'm gonna literally suck being a Troll Warrior mountain Thane? I'm probably done with him
[1:51:32] Atomicpanda: at least covs came with cosmetic class fantasy
[1:51:40] Thoreya: lol
[1:51:43] sterlz_the_ok: Yep
[1:51:45] Majustea: big agree
[1:51:47] Bulgogiprince: agreed
[1:51:48] Shaduoken: a bit
[1:51:49] Sindorein1124: I sure hope so
[1:51:49] chryseis: Yup
[1:51:49] neverbornlucky: Taliesin you can mount my pcock anytime
[1:51:49] Brewmaster_Holsten: probably
[1:51:51] ivashkov92: Ya
[1:51:59] LolitaAldea: i like him before, not anymore
[1:51:59] Alonarius: I don't know how hes changed
[1:52:00] OatsMate: Yea. He's spread off to make his own community, he hasn't played in months, etc.
[1:52:00] netonkent: It will never be that bad because blizzard are listening now
[1:52:02] DarkWataru: TRUE, bro doesn't even play the shit.
[1:52:07] Daetroxe: Fear.
[1:52:09] RosieSeren: feels like people are looking for soemthing to be negative about
[1:52:09] sterlz_the_ok: @DarkWataru THIS
[1:52:10] CardinalTX: Asmon is good at what he does but for me he is no longer relevant
[1:52:15] apheelia96: I dont listen to creators. I decide for myself. Asmon I used to watch him but he dont even play wow anymore
[1:52:15] Atomicpanda: i was done with him before it was cool. tneDorkthyr
[1:52:15] Thoreya: i havent watched him in 2 years
[1:52:19] Travnar: I was someone who actually liked him, but all his interactions with the game is to just complain. He used to actually play.
[1:52:24] bucephalos: he is barely even doing wow content at this point
[1:52:24] mattyxoqt: yeah true he doesnt even play anymore
[1:52:25] Daetroxe: *Fair.
[1:52:27] Metket: asmongold is shitting the game cause he can't have time to collect things as much as he does before
[1:52:32] databob1: World of peacetime....it's a farming sim
[1:52:35] Thugis123: he needs to make a living somehow
[1:52:37] Majustea: he logs in long enough to complain and gets carried through the new raid, then leaves and turns playing other games into a wow complaint fest still somehow
[1:52:37] Alonarius: I really really liked his content a year ago and now I just can't stand him
[1:52:38] CardinalTX: Let it go Asmon
[1:52:40] TenWin: He has some good points SOME TIMES... the issue is just that he talks as if he has any form of authority and it is really annoying
[1:52:46] apheelia96: @Travnar true me too and now he dont even play
[1:52:50] Scarto22: True
[1:52:50] teddyg55: But making anti-WoW content is just a "free money" button
[1:52:58] darth_nykal: hes the weird stalker who broke up with his girlfriend but cant stop obsessing over her
[1:52:59] Fibnkak: I think the Community is done with AS and that is two fold because his audience has moved on from WOW too
[1:53:02] Aakku: It's any creator, that doesn't play anymore. It's pretty hard to take them seriously when they don't even casually play.
[1:53:04] mattyxoqt: I was like that before it was cool
[1:53:09] DarkWataru: Not to mention when he did play, he just got carried to everything and then complained about lack of content lol.
[1:53:12] HazMatt_Prime: Gotta say, that sounds like your bias, Tali.
[1:53:17] Co1eCash: Feels like he's just talking shit about his ex?
[1:53:22] Atomicpanda: it's like elon
[1:53:23] hectoz: I mean, he is done with the game. He cannot invest as much time as he can in the game and perform on his career. So he made his choice. But he can bring some interesting discussion points. I can't speak for the whole community though.
[1:53:25] pegseleven: are you playing sod at all?
[1:53:28] neverbornlucky: Taliesin all Asmongold does is steal other people videos and react to them
[1:53:32] sterlz_the_ok: loool
[1:53:37] KaisenSiru: KEKW
[1:53:42] TrolltwopointO: @Travnar Same here, i used to watch him and he had some weird takes, but now it's just boring to listen to him complaining without actually touching the game .
[1:53:47] Alonarius: I don't want to feel bad for enjoying a game that I enjoy playing *lé shrug
[1:53:49] TenWin: It would be as if HeelsVsBabyface would come back and talk as if he knows anything about WoW... just not as bad because Asmon isn't as untolerable
[1:53:49] Majustea: content creators realized that the audience of people wanting to hate WoW is a massive market; from after shadowlands. Now they're desparately trying to get that back/reach the same audience
[1:54:21] HazMatt_Prime: Lol I didn't mean that as a gotcha or insult. I meant that as a "You don't like him, so you only see when people don't like him as well"
[1:54:26] darth_nykal: doesn't help he low-keyed proved streamer-privilege (or probably Asmond-privilege) is a thing.
[1:54:29] databob1: @taliesinandevitel your peacocking
[1:54:34] edd_3000: I don't think his voice really carries much weight anymore, like it used to back in the day. But he will always have some sort of influence and he will always have a link with the game. It's like he divorced Blizzard but WoW is his child. He's in for life.
[1:54:35] Lenitas: "You're biased"; everyone is biased, being open about where your biases lie, is good?
[1:54:39] Aakku: I thought Bell just designs games.
[1:54:44] Valestrus: hi @TaliesinAndEvitel hi chat :D
[1:54:57] NymannTV: i fucking agree, god ive had enough of him
[1:54:59] eyeoin: @Majustea nah, he really created that market more than anyone.
[1:55:05] neverbornlucky: I don't like Asmongold cause he's texan
[1:55:08] Nulgar: Wait, does Bell play again?
[1:55:19] Nerzalus: anyone who doesnt play wow, doesnt need to comment on the game since they have no clue
[1:55:19] MrAndersen_: you dont have to like someone to enjoy watching them to be fair
[1:55:21] MystivaFitz: but the people that still play wow shit alot on game also no? lol
[1:55:22] Majustea: @eyeoin Him specifically? Yes. But I'm talking about bellular/asmon/etc
[1:55:22] Daetroxe: @Nulgar Who knows.
[1:55:23] Ryuuza930: if I never hear his name again it will be too soon
[1:55:25] Brewmaster_Holsten: WoW-subreddit used to be more positive towards him. Now they clearly aren't anymore.
[1:55:32] jmalmin: Not many care what Asmongold has to say about wow. And he has moved on from the game also to do other things.
[1:55:50] apheelia96: in fairness he slowed on wow after his mom passed.
[1:55:54] Ladryn: he just needs to do 1 transmog competition and all will be forgiven
[1:56:00] netonkent: I think slot of people are just bored with negative in wow in general. It was way over the top
[1:56:06] Majustea: I'd rather hear someone who PLAYS THE GAME complain about the GAME THEY'RE PLAYING than someone who doesnt play it anymore react negatively to things they see out of context
[1:56:08] mattyxoqt: logical
[1:56:08] LolitaAldea: the diference is that he now says shit that is a total lie
[1:56:16] darth_nykal: @jmalmin Wish he would stop. He actively worsens the community of any game he plays
[1:56:45] jhopps12: some have said that the fact that he doesn't play the game anymore means we should listen to why he doesn't...but that only goes so far, imo. @TaliesinAndEvitel
[1:56:55] Majustea: The way he'll make a video reacting to this clip too, its inevitable
[1:57:02] Arlaeya: I respect and listen to those who love the game but have valid criticisms of it. No interest in criticisms for profit with no love for the game.
[1:57:03] ivashkov92: @darth_nykal agreed
[1:57:11] Alonarius: And now... he's just a guy who doesn't wash his hands after a piss
[1:57:12] DiscordianKitty: I don't think anyone should listen to "I don't care if my game is generated by AI" guy
[1:57:13] jhopps12: agreed
[1:57:19] TenWin: "You turned in your WoW fancard... your opinion no longer matter."
[1:57:26] databob1: @taliesinandevitel the former players thar crap on it are great 👍 :/
[1:57:32] KaisenSiru: devoNOTE devoNOTE
[1:57:34] Nulgar: Or most importantly, they got that impression while actually playing
[1:57:45] aeson_of_raid_sock: he’s just a professional shit stirrer
[1:57:48] NymannTV: asmon and his army of ppl who didnt play the game since WOD, having an opinion about the game now? no ty...
[1:57:52] djalminnha: u rly think that he is not playing game? I think he is not playing retail, but i am not sure that he isnt playing SOD
[1:58:16] OatsMate: @TenWin It's not "fancard" it's just he doesn't bother playing anymore, and if he did he's doing it for clickbait. He doesn't care for the game anymore, he's not actually judging it.
[1:58:24] databob1: I liked that part too
[1:58:40] sterlz_the_ok: YEP
[1:58:40] Arlaeya: I love that scene as was so happy to see Dan plays through exactly like me
[1:58:43] Majustea: I'd gladly slack off a few of the avengers, honestly
[1:58:51] HazMatt_Prime: I played it but I don't remember. May I have a reminder?
[1:58:51] spooky_seraph: Context is very important
[1:58:52] TenWin: @OatsMate I know I was making ajoke XD
[1:58:55] OatsMate: As someone who did exactly that, I agree.
[1:58:59] Atomicpanda: i like the avengers assemble quest because i can go help tuskar and niffen
[1:59:00] Nulgar: SO many bad takes happen because people only watch cinematics as reacted to by reaction people like Asmon
[1:59:02] Animeinn: Asmon only reacts to WoW videos which negatively portray the game/ company. All for clicks and views.
[1:59:05] OatsMate: @TenWin Oh. My bad then.
[1:59:12] Nulgar: Tldr what Tali just said
[1:59:22] neverbornlucky: Taliesin then which wow character is Deadpool ?
[1:59:47] mewpoke_: you sly dog you had me monologuing
[1:59:53] KaisenSiru: YEP
[1:59:58] Borocil: Asmongold and Trump are like a splinter that is infected and will not go away bajYouDontSay
[2:00:04] Valestrus: is it not ysera that unblocks it? perhaps i am misremembering it
[2:00:09] TenWin: @neverbornlucky Milhouse Manastorm. He just REFUSE TO DIE
[2:00:23] KaisenSiru: buying time is a classic with talking
[2:00:24] HazMatt_Prime: Ooooh that scene? I love that scene! I love the Assembling....I question why people don't just give up after seeing that, but it was cool.
[2:00:26] netonkent: The battle was actually really good, sad to see all the night elves covered in blood. Good job wow is a Disney cartoon now so we don't see that haha
[2:00:40] spooky_seraph: oh fyrakk what big ears you have
[2:00:47] Nulgar: So THAT'S why she talks so slowly tneEvi
[2:01:07] OatsMate: Why don't we, the heros, simply attack Fyrakk as he's monologuing?
[2:01:16] Majustea: yall will see one emotional expansion cinematic without murder and call the game a disney cartoon, make it make sense NotLikeThis
[2:01:19] databob1: Thrall threw his axe again, but with better effect
[2:01:22] cyclopsnerd: i love that questline for giving us the kazoo of q'onzu line
[2:01:34] Lenitas: @OatsMate Cause we don't have the rest of the raid with us yet
[2:01:37] KaisenSiru: The RP texts was so good with the big lore characters
[2:01:42] jmalmin: if you fly around and see all the characters that are there it is nice, I do like that Chromie and the dude she fell through time with of the infinite are fighting together against a large drake.
[2:01:42] Valestrus: is it not ysera that unblocks the portals ? i may not be recalling it correctly
[2:01:51] Nulgar: Timber Hearth frogmu1Heart
[2:01:57] aeson_of_raid_sock: must feel bad being a quest designer knowing Taliesin is the only person paying attention
[2:01:58] knightjudicator: @Majustea literally, this has been the most mature expansion overall too
[2:01:59] Travnar: I think another issue with Asmon is so much of his wow react stuff just feels cynical. "My audience likes my shitting on WoW, so I'll shit on WoW, even though I don't really care about the game anymore."  Otherwise, he'd be praising all of the positive stuff as well with SoD, etc.
[2:02:09] bobbybigbuxx: what does your streaming name mean? theres supposed to be 2 people?
[2:02:17] chryseis: No one could ever make me hate that questline, or the party quests
[2:02:37] Nerzalus: by not playing the quests you miss out on like half of the information
[2:02:40] Metket: you can't see evitel?
[2:02:44] neverbornlucky: Taliesin is now 4 people
[2:02:45] Saiyori: she's right there...
[2:02:45] OatsMate: LUL
[2:02:47] bobbybigbuxx: kek
[2:02:50] Tanthok: lol
[2:02:52] Valestrus: wife > the glass?
[2:02:54] Valestrus: hehe jks#
[2:02:55] bobbybigbuxx: she'll be fine
[2:02:57] aeson_of_raid_sock: that Prosecco be hittin
[2:02:57] zaibtsu: Hello everyone
[2:02:58] Majustea: just because evitel is cosplaying the invisible woman from the fantastic 4 doesnt mean she's not literally here right now WOW
[2:02:58] KaisenSiru: anniesCry
[2:03:01] Durwen: yeah, man, can't you see her?
[2:03:10] bobbybigbuxx: <3
[2:03:12] neverbornlucky: Taliesin you have to change your name now to 4 people name
[2:03:15] CardinalTX: Shes invincible i cant see her
[2:03:21] onathehunter: happy friday
[2:03:37] ApolloRache: You guys did the epilogue in bg32
[2:03:40] ApolloRache: ?*
[2:03:48] onathehunter: be careful Evis been none to write some banger tweets
[2:03:50] Alonarius: Hate people disrespecting this channel, Taliesin & Evitel & Alonarius :/
[2:03:53] Atomicpanda: you have to fall from a pretty high spot for it to activate
[2:03:57] TenWin: @ApolloRache BG32?! Wow times goes fast
[2:04:09] bomayaa: The BG3 streams were some of the best things I ever saw - especially your meltdowns Tali :)
[2:04:17] mewpoke_: im sorry but when i finished bg3 karlach came up to me and i was like "who the hell are you what are you talking about?"
[2:04:23] saarkhastick: Tali, you should get a full color "realism" tat of Karlach lighting the cigar with her thumb as your BG3 tattoo.
[2:04:25] TenWin: I need to play BG3... it just insist  on lagginw hen I play it
[2:04:53] Majustea: yes
[2:04:54] bobbybigbuxx: you can have the cursor in the macro area and then shift click the item and it will write in the items name
[2:04:55] Lewmer: 'W'
[2:04:59] OatsMate: 'P'
[2:05:04] Metket: angelic feather
[2:05:14] TenWin: E
[2:05:15] databob1: I accidentally let the telling child die...I felt so bad
[2:05:16] LolitaAldea: I think you need to have it active for it to work
[2:05:20] ApolloRache: Well then im going to watch the bg3  playthrough, have a good stream tali
[2:05:32] databob1: Teifling
[2:05:49] SpacedemonX: That wont work
[2:05:59] CardinalTX: Jade Parasol isnt visible in Moonkin form....RIOT!
[2:06:08] lonesomecowboy: wait did you put your bg3 playthrough up somewhere?
[2:06:10] Caladin_the_Paladin: @SpacedemonX But it's just crazy enough to work...but yeah, it won't.
[2:06:10] bobbybigbuxx: this macro will not work, you can't use a keybind in the macro like that
[2:06:14] Nulgar: There are more bars, Tali...
[2:06:16] ramzie0: Do you have a hidden action bar?
[2:06:20] SpacedemonX: You can't bind it to a movement key
[2:06:21] onathehunter: Tali in my WoW down time should I finish the MSQ for FF (I’m like 15 quests to Heavensward) or start BG3.  I want to do both lol
[2:06:33] SpacedemonX: It will just unbind that key
[2:06:58] Nulgar: Case never mattered unless it's code
[2:06:58] Calfast: Stylish Black Parasol has a cast time
[2:06:58] TenWin: You could just click the button
[2:07:06] Daetroxe: Priest don't need parasol. :P
[2:07:08] Kayonne: You can just Shift+Click the toy when creating the macro and it will put the name of the toy into the text box itself, no need to type it out
[2:07:29] Daetroxe: You can't us it if you are falling.
[2:07:43] Travnar: @TaliesinAndEvitel idk how many times ive actually cared that I fell and died lmao
[2:07:49] bobbybigbuxx: marry poppins inc
[2:08:01] saarkhastick: Need to roll a toon named Mary Poppins
[2:08:09] TenWin: The nightmare of doing the 20 raid bosses, and having to slip into Black wing descent to get the final two bosses and hear the terrible VA and jokes from nefarius
[2:08:13] DarthTaz0: it's good for raid when you drop down to the lava pool after snake boss
[2:08:24] Kayonne: even the animation is the same as the one from the Venthyr
[2:08:36] sterlz_the_ok: I used it a ton in the second raid in DF to get to the Echo of Neltharion
[2:08:36] Caladin_the_Paladin: It's probably still visible all the time, but it'll be green.
[2:08:41] holyzeke: I’m Mary poppins
[2:08:45] Dark_Lady_Looshkin: it's a recolour
[2:08:54] Valestrus: i froze it
[2:08:57] Travnar: You can always just refund
[2:08:59] mattyxoqt: might be green or colourblind green
[2:09:00] Kayonne: it might be Teal and not green :P
[2:09:31] ivashkov92: I like that!
[2:09:41] ivashkov92: wish it was 100
[2:09:42] Kayonne: color was applied by a different person confirmed, it is in fact green :p
[2:09:44] KaisenSiru: anniesHmm
[2:09:53] Lewmer: You'd look 70% more fabulous.
[2:10:00] Daetroxe: It would be nice for a monk mog.
[2:10:00] mattyxoqt: maybe save it for another time
[2:10:17] Caladin_the_Paladin: I'd say if you're hesitating to buy it this much, you're probably safe passing on it.
[2:10:19] Valestrus: freeze it
[2:10:21] Valestrus: :D
[2:10:40] MeggoArt: it's more an RP item, being able to walk around with it is great
[2:10:47] PicarusLoL: buy it so you can put it in your player owned house for next patch ;)
[2:10:53] rilozeta: I forgot to buy what I wanted from the previous rotation 😔
[2:10:55] Nulgar: It allows you to steer though
[2:11:26] Metket: you can't fall twice Kappa
[2:11:27] sterlz_the_ok: likely
[2:11:30] Nerzalus: probably does
[2:11:35] ivashkov92: That sounds like Blizz haha
[2:11:36] Sindorein1124: seems to share a cooldown with goblin glider
[2:11:38] Daetroxe: Test it.
[2:11:43] DiscordianKitty: they probably share a cooldown
[2:11:44] Elerments: Yes they do
[2:11:45] bomayaa: idk you're the streamer, try it
[2:11:48] Nulgar: No shared cd , but triggers a 2min shared cd
[2:11:50] Synkronos: All umbrellas share cooldown
[2:11:54] DiscordianKitty: you can always refund it
[2:11:54] ivashkov92: lmao
[2:11:56] Elerments: I just tested
[2:12:00] TenWin: Make the sacrifice for us
[2:12:00] Daetroxe: You can refund it.
[2:12:09] Nulgar: No, wrong
[2:12:11] a_cyrus_: dont waste your coins this month, nothing worth
[2:12:19] saarkhastick: You can refund after using it?
[2:12:20] Daetroxe: You can refund anything you by on the TP.
[2:12:21] OatsMate: TFW you can't dual wield umbrellas. :(
[2:12:27] onathehunter: How many times do you plan on falling in five minutes lol
[2:12:46] Nulgar: Item has 5min cd, triggers 2 or 3min CD on other parasols
[2:12:47] Caladin_the_Paladin: Grats!!
[2:12:48] Daetroxe: GJ!
[2:12:53] Arlaeya: woot!!
[2:12:54] Saiyori: AAAY congrats!
[2:12:58] iamdrewonline: Woot!!!
[2:12:58] Yurimooo: Proud of you <3
[2:13:02] hectoz: gg
[2:13:03] mattyxoqt: very professional
[2:13:04] Metket: @TaliesinAndEvitel those comments on that tweet was golden LUL
[2:13:07] rhonins: Nice job Mate
[2:13:19] foxieloxiee: PrideRise PrideRise
[2:13:35] Synkronos: 3k Rio! That's better than Naguura, right? Kappa
[2:13:39] KulMital: i pugged 3k as a noname warrior:)
[2:13:40] Lewmer: haha the old "streamer privilgaged" huh.
[2:13:41] djalminnha: what a load of bullshit
[2:13:47] Nerzalus: I'll treat you right Tali
[2:14:05] Thoreya: ya season hasnt been bad with that at all
[2:14:05] REDSUNDERGROUND: lol ive pugged 4 toons to 3k im literally  no one
[2:14:06] neverbornlucky: Taliesin that is wrong we are here to see you fail at PUGGING and other raids cause we get more thrill on when streamer fails don't l let them fool you
[2:14:24] Deatheran: honnestly i love the DF dungeons
[2:14:34] Daetroxe: I pug 20s as a healer and most groups are fine.
[2:14:36] hitchmeister59: Just look at the thousands of people thronging around you giving you gold just like every time Asmon logs into WoW.
[2:15:10] Deatheran: how much Tech there is in azure vaults. how good was algethar, the only bad one is ulduman
[2:15:35] McScooterson: vault tech  got removed though so it'll be really interesting timing again
[2:15:38] lonesomecowboy: this season is sick as hell
[2:16:06] lonesomecowboy: uldaman halls of infusion and neltharus are both extremely extremely bad which is too bad
[2:16:12] Elerments: I found a good core group this season and it made it a blast
[2:16:19] rilozeta: only 8 a week for vault
[2:16:23] Saiyori: what do you get for 3k rating?
[2:16:23] wanik90: I wonder if they'll try a seasonal affix again to mix things up next season
[2:16:24] hasseksek: how high M+ do you have to do across the board to get to 2000 rating?
[2:16:36] TenWin: @TaliesinAndEvitel Just has a HUGE flashback to early Shadowlands, when you commended Shadowlands and thought it was going to be one of the best expansions
[2:16:42] Rantsuu: +15 I think
[2:16:45] McScooterson: 15s
[2:16:45] ropergaran: it's not that great for survival
[2:16:49] mr_kinky: 26->27 people get really toxic x)
[2:16:50] Rantsuu: Both fort and tyra
[2:16:54] lonesomecowboy: early shadowlands was awesome
[2:16:55] Thoreya: BANGER
[2:16:59] Thoreya: SL s1 was fire
[2:17:02] Nulgar: Nah 18s for 2500
[2:17:03] lonesomecowboy: honestly even longer than that
[2:17:10] lonesomecowboy: like all of castle nathria prog was awesome
[2:17:14] Lewmer: @TenWin Until you went to check out the other covenant :)
[2:17:17] neverbornlucky: Taliesin Shadowlands classic will be the best classic EVER
[2:17:22] Valestrus: and the grind in 9.1
[2:17:25] Valestrus: imo
[2:17:27] Nerzalus: If you didnt care about min maxing your covenant shadowlands was great
[2:17:29] Thoreya: covenants werent too much of an issue in s1 bc it was new, nathria was a banger, m+ and pvp were super good
[2:17:35] DiscordianKitty: i wonder when we'll see shadowlands nostalgia
[2:17:40] lonesomecowboy: unironically i think castle nathria is one of the best raids theyve ever made although i have fairly limited experience
[2:17:44] wanik90: Shadowlands had so many issues but M+ was pretty consistently a banger the whole expansion
[2:17:48] HazMatt_Prime: I didn't play Shadowlands. I don't know why people hated it. People just say they do. I liked questing in it and the raids and the aesthetic...
[2:18:02] TenWin: 9.0
[2:18:04] TenWin: not 10.0
[2:18:06] DiscordianKitty: shadowlands nostalgia has to happen sooner or later, people always end up being kind to old expansion they hated sooner or later
[2:18:11] lonesomecowboy: lol @DiscordianKitty who remembers the golden era of wow 9.1 not like this modern BADonflight
[2:18:32] lonesomecowboy: i guess DRAG-ON-flight was right there
[2:18:34] Lewmer: Not many other patches we had a world pandemic tho.
[2:18:40] JarJar_Brinkz: Shadowlands was the best expansion
[2:18:47] Gizwix: Shadowlands classic?
[2:18:53] TenWin: The zones in Shadowlands still had a major issue, epecially with Orbios as the "airport". :P
[2:18:56] JarJar_Brinkz: LUL
[2:18:59] DiscordianKitty: i was in tazavesh yesterday and that was such a great dungeon story-wise
[2:19:10] mike_whatever: WoD had an amazing leveling experience
[2:19:12] NymannTV: as a collector i quite enjoyed shadowlands
[2:19:13] Gizwix: hype
[2:19:19] Lacee666: Aware
[2:19:20] Dark_Lady_Looshkin: dear god
[2:19:23] apheelia96: I didnt like the way you got from one zone to the next. And unpopular opinion ( I had a blast with BFA)
[2:19:25] Nerzalus: I can't wait to play WoD classic Kappa
[2:19:28] Elerments: Hopefully we have the same fun launch
[2:19:31] TenWin: @TaliesinAndEvitel I wonder how they will handle WoD classic. XD What, will the expansion just be half as long as the other classics.
[2:19:32] Nulgar: Tbh relaxation of Covenant restrictions would still have come only a year in, as with previous systems in previous expansions
[2:19:32] Metket: still need around 800k anima to get all transmogs, i'm not gonna grind that again
[2:19:41] netonkent: 9.0 was my favourite since vanilla just didn't like the .1 or .2
[2:19:43] neverbornlucky: Taliesin 5 years of streaming wow and your best achievement is you get to call hero talents POO
[2:19:43] REDSUNDERGROUND: wod classic comes out im quitting until legin classic
[2:19:52] JarJar_Brinkz: I feel like EVERY classic is worth it for the leveling experience and first few weeks of content
[2:19:56] dright424: WoD classic would only last like 6 months lol
[2:20:07] jhopps12: wonder if Shadowlands Classic would bring the old Blizzard back in a Classic form.... Kappa
[2:20:14] Nerraw3: Is there a good claustrophobic?
[2:20:14] Lewmer: Torghast being mandatory was the worst.
[2:20:25] DiscordianKitty: dragonriding was such a pleasure after so much constantly having to be on flight paths all the time
[2:20:37] hitchmeister59: Personally, I don't see the point in any Classic post Wrath.
[2:20:37] JarJar_Brinkz: Yeah true
[2:20:42] apheelia96: yeah they were pretty but I felt trapped
[2:20:42] Nerzalus: Torghast was awesome SeemsGood
[2:20:44] HazMatt_Prime: I do get the hate for Sylvanas and The Jailer, tho
[2:20:52] Nulgar: @dright424 ALL classic content only lasts a few weeks
[2:20:55] love_eggplant: but thy wont do classic after cata right??
[2:20:59] lonesomecowboy: revendreth is one of my favorite zones ever and while I don't think they would have been able to make them as atmospheric as they did, it definitely made them feel like a weird bubble theme park thing instead of yeah a world
[2:21:01] neverbornlucky: Taliesin  polly shores bio dome best movie  ever
[2:21:01] HazMatt_Prime: Would The Jailer be our most difficult fight lorewise?
[2:21:03] cyclopsnerd: i already say it's my fav
[2:21:04] jhopps12: Revendreth pre-flying was my LEAST favorite zone ever. After flying, it was my favorite.
[2:21:14] Vendrek: I actually have enjoyed DF...
[2:21:18] apheelia96: sometimes Im too lazy to fly my dragon but I do love it
[2:21:20] TenWin: I can't specify what it was but at release Shadowlands felt... unreal. and not in a good way. I caught myself at the start of shadowlands, in the middle of Bastion... and thought "Why doesn't this feel like an expansion launch" and I couldn't put my finger on why.
[2:21:24] love_eggplant: mop is the maximum for me. i'd NOT play after.
[2:21:27] kuuple_boople: I'm pretty happy with Dragonflight
[2:21:37] Hippwn: I think they really want to get to classic MoP and then they will evaluate if they want to keep going
[2:21:37] Lenitas: I really appreciated Dan Olson's take on expansion storylines in general
[2:21:40] Dark_Lady_Looshkin: I don't see the point of classic cata, as that's just retail.
[2:21:43] bucephalos: I am interested what they are going to do with wod
[2:21:45] caradosailanthus: Yeah Cata was literally the break between classic style WoW and newer WoW
[2:21:46] lonesomecowboy: i think they want to get to mop lol
[2:21:48] Lacee666: the war within classic PogChamp
[2:21:55] Metket: they will do panda max no way there will be wod
[2:22:02] Vendrek: Tol Barad was the one thing I actually enjoyed from Cata...wasn't a fan of most everything else
[2:22:04] the_howlermonkey: Shadowlands SOD could be legendary
[2:22:13] DiscordianKitty: the amount i've aged the last few minutes christ
[2:22:19] love_eggplant: war within classic
[2:22:20] ivashkov92: Yeah for sure
[2:22:21] TenWin: I can't specify what it was but at release Shadowlands felt... unreal. and not in a good way. I caught myself at the start of shadowlands, in the middle of Bastion... and thought "Why doesn't this feel like an expansion launch" and I couldn't put my finger on why.
[2:22:30] dright424: Holly did progression classic servers at EQ, so its not surprising that they seem to be doing the WoW equivalent
[2:22:33] ivashkov92: WoD classic may mean a completed game 🤣
[2:22:36] Alonarius: Surely they'll have to add stuff in WoD classic?
[2:22:55] ivashkov92: I really might play MoP classic.. not gonna lie
[2:23:01] Valestrus: do you think classic will eventually catch up with retail? i guess it doesnt make sense... but i feel that classic expansion release is going quicker
[2:23:07] neverbornlucky: Taliesin if you are going to talk about being old you need to use the youth filter
[2:23:14] Thoreya: cata classic just means were 1 step closer to mop classic :)
[2:23:24] Metket: you are right
[2:23:27] DiscordianKitty: there's classic classic and then expansion classic
[2:23:31] DiscordianKitty: and the expansion changes
[2:23:33] caradosailanthus: I hate that I really want to have perma TBC servers
[2:23:35] Vendrek: TBC Classic is gone just like Wrath is about to be
[2:23:35] Nulgar: Would be dead otherwise, stretched too thin
[2:23:51] Lewmer: Vanilla is a thing, and Wrath classic is a thing. Separate but only Wrath will update.
[2:24:03] neverbornlucky: Taliesin shadowlands classic will be fine cause they will always have wow sod classic too
[2:24:09] Metket: LMAO
[2:24:16] Thoreya: after worldsoul saga pog
[2:24:16] Dark_Lady_Looshkin: Classic Classic
[2:24:21] bucephalos: TBC Classic/Classic2
[2:24:23] Lenitas: Except once they hit BFA classic they will also release classic classic cause that will be as old then as vanilla was on classics release
[2:24:25] Nerzalus: TBC Classic Remastered
[2:24:27] ArcaneSyntax: Maybe SoD TBC?
[2:24:35] DiscordianKitty: classic with follower dungeons and raids so they're essentially single player
[2:24:39] val89: Maybe they will go the way of EQ and have progression servers launch ever year on a faster cadence
[2:25:08] Nerzalus: most of us will be too old to remember
[2:25:13] ivashkov92: SoD TBC would be cool
[2:25:15] TenWin: I can't specify what it was but at release Shadowlands felt... unreal. and not in a good way. I caught myself at the start of shadowlands, in the middle of Bastion... and thought "Why doesn't this feel like an expansion launch" and I couldn't put my finger on why.
[2:25:17] bomayaa: Was player housing in TBC? Put it in
[2:25:48] neverbornlucky: Taliesin when I'm that old should I go c cath or adult diapers for raiding
[2:25:54] apheelia96: I loved BFA
[2:25:54] JarJar_Brinkz: I really enjoyed first few weeks of SL
[2:26:09] Thoreya: bfa 8.2 on was my shit
[2:26:13] phemii: first  2-3 months of SL were PEAK wow for me all friends were playing like 20 irl friends
[2:26:15] MeggoArt: im stanning BFA forever
[2:26:25] Vendrek: Rep grinding...welcome to Cata...
[2:26:26] Thoreya: essences/corruption...my thing
[2:26:40] JarJar_Brinkz: D: But what about the 100k mounts after your 3 months of rep grinding
[2:26:52] bucephalos: Not enough Anima
[2:27:02] Nerzalus: obtaining the power to make the legendary was cool too
[2:27:04] phemii: besides content problems I liked SL alot actually
[2:27:08] ramzie0: @JarJar_Brinkz ugh mounts that cost upwards of 100k once you get to exalted are such bs
[2:27:22] Lewmer: Unless you got your worst lego drop first.
[2:27:34] lonesomecowboy: shadowlands will feel special to me forever tbh i met a bunch of people a few of which are like IRL friends I met at blizzcon and stuff like I dunno I think expansions you love are extremely personal in a way and people forget that with all the "OBJECTIVELY BAD" discourse
[2:27:34] ivashkov92: yeah SL had a really great start
[2:27:38] JarJar_Brinkz: @ramzie0 Ohhhh yeah its the worst
[2:27:41] Lewmer: Making 5 Rogues until the best Lego dropped sucked.
[2:28:04] Nerzalus: maybe in legion you had to do that
[2:28:08] lumaday: I thought the zones were gonna be amazing but ended up being kinda underwhelmed. DF has hit zones out of the park imo.
[2:28:27] Lenitas: Feeling well in the "current" zone(s) is such a subtly important thing
[2:28:28] cyclopsnerd: city of secrets wooooooo, (the city is one crumbled tower) lol
[2:28:29] ivashkov92: Yeah Maw setting again was a bad idea
[2:28:30] Dark_Lady_Looshkin: Didn't mind the gameplay myself, but, from a roleplayer pov, it was derelict.
[2:28:41] ivashkov92: terrible
[2:28:44] neverbornlucky: taliesin I loved the maw
[2:28:46] Atomicpanda: are you read for some maw?
[2:28:50] Lewmer: And you'll have to run right thru' the maw to get to the raid.
[2:29:02] Zerrahki: I'm excited for the Shadowlands Classic stand alone where you only spend time in the maw the entire time!
[2:29:16] lonesomecowboy: DUDE THE RUN TO THE RAID WAS SO FUCKING BAD
[2:29:21] holyzeke: you did a 22 Rise? that place can fuck right off lol
[2:29:22] lonesomecowboy: I BLOCKED THAT FROM MY MEMORY
[2:29:25] Nerzalus: just take the fp
[2:29:38] DarthTaz0: And the shortcut was character loced
[2:29:39] lumaday: lmao so true
[2:29:39] Zerrahki: I remember people on alts that didn't do the quest and were constantly getting feared in front of the raid.
[2:29:40] lonesomecowboy: not at first
[2:29:41] ivashkov92: You couldn’t make this shit up 😂
[2:29:43] kuuple_boople: BUT WAIT.... THERE'S MORE (Maw)
[2:29:47] Nerzalus: she had the gate there
[2:29:47] lonesomecowboy: there was a portal they put like 6 weeks in
[2:29:49] lonesomecowboy: but way too long
[2:29:52] Atomicpanda: i didn't do it just because the run to the raid sucked so hard
[2:29:54] caradosailanthus: Just stealth through
[2:29:55] lumaday: the strong mobs in the world
[2:29:57] cyclopsnerd: wasn't the TP unlock not account wide when it was added? I might be misremembering
[2:30:09] bucephalos: Maw / Maw Hunts/ Maw Invasions/ More Maw/Korthia
[2:30:15] ivashkov92: lmao
[2:30:15] bomayaa: lol
[2:30:15] dright424: If 9.1 was what they originally described Korithia as it would have been cool. The whole ancient city thing sounded cool, instead we got some randome buildings in the maw.
[2:30:16] Metket: after kortia, zereth mortis was awesome though
[2:30:16] AlanC2024: there was a skip to the raid where venari was
[2:30:19] lonesomecowboy: AHAHA I wasn't trying to gotcha you my followup was that took WAY too long haha
[2:30:20] ArcaneSyntax: I just switched to prot spec and just rand lmao, not getting knocked off my mount was bis
[2:30:28] 6NEZ9: What? There was a portal?
[2:30:32] Dark_Lady_Looshkin: I got fed up with the lfr version and didn't even finish it
[2:30:39] Lewmer: Any island like Timeless Isles is a win in most peoples eyes.
[2:30:41] bucephalos: Love the skybox of zereth mortis
[2:30:42] ArcaneSyntax: the back half SL was legit pretty good.
[2:30:59] cyclopsnerd: I'm glad we didn't get an argus style patch in DF. We stayed on the island the whole time
[2:31:04] Rev3rendBilly: I dunno, Zereth Mortis would be better than Zaralek Caverns.
[2:31:14] holyzeke: remember you climbed up the whole chain on the ptr in 9.1 best stream ever
[2:31:28] apheelia96: NO it cannot die
[2:31:34] JarJar_Brinkz: I think its impossible for WoW to die now, because the other games that were its competition also "died"
[2:31:49] neverbornlucky: Taliesin the jokes on you we all going to be playing wow on Apple Pro Vision
[2:31:53] apheelia96: I think I would cry
[2:31:57] Dark_Lady_Looshkin: For an era of our lives when we were all stuck indoors, they really dropped the ball on retention
[2:31:57] JTshape: atrleast SoD numbers are higher than expected i think
[2:32:09] Rev3rendBilly: No Tali, it will be YOUR fault obviously
[2:32:13] DiscordianKitty: What did 9.1 do again?
[2:32:16] Lewmer: Shadowlands caused half my long term (10+ years) raiders to leave the game.
[2:32:24] Vendrek: Covenant talents and hero talents have a very similar vibe but with locked from 1-2 specializations of a class...
[2:32:26] bomayaa: the way the music dropped out then when you said that "it was 9.1s fault"
[2:32:37] Lewmer: The FF14 exodus says it all :)
[2:32:39] Metket: c c c cc combo
[2:32:44] Nerraw3: Zereth Mortis also introduced the catalyst
[2:32:50] CardinalTX: I should take a wow break and finish FFXIV before next expac
[2:32:53] Valestrus: i am personally hopeful about the future. i think the story will finally have a solid logical progression. lets just hope that the systems are good...
[2:32:58] kuuple_boople: Domination gear/gems was kind of cringe as well
[2:33:17] JarJar_Brinkz: But why did everyone stop playing FFXIV too? It's a genre issue more than anything IMO
[2:33:17] Nerzalus: I just played too many toons to notice a drought
[2:33:18] Lewmer: AP grind not being a thing is a breath of fresh air right now.
[2:33:26] holyzeke: I know tons of ppl who quit then
[2:33:27] JarJar_Brinkz: MMOs dont last like they used to
[2:33:29] apheelia96: I stopped in Shadowlands but only because I had gotten Covid
[2:33:32] Rev3rendBilly: @TaliesinAndEvitel 9.1 worked really well with the scandals because it gave every other content creator the moral highground when they left because they didn't enjoy the game. (what's up Preach)
[2:33:58] ivashkov92: They smacked hard on rock bottom but they did start getting shit together slowly and started making some of the best changes fundamentally to the game
[2:34:01] Lewmer: 9.1.5 was the turn around Bliz needed, not the player base.
[2:34:06] lonesomecowboy: dude I remember how dire things were during wod drought but it still paled to how volatile 9.1 was
[2:34:08] databob1: I don't want wow to die..
[2:34:15] CardinalTX: As ive aged i will admit i still really enjoy mmos, i just dont care to play with other people honestly
[2:34:41] AlanC2024: I knew. I never stopped playing
[2:34:58] Ysarahhh: can confirm, am a loser
[2:35:02] gachimane_: if wow dis, classic will liive on and they can get to work on that
[2:35:04] murloc_kingkiller: i started playing wow for the first time in season 3 of DF lol
[2:35:04] apheelia96: you played cause its your job
[2:35:05] Lewmer: Sounds like a good YT video that Tali :)
[2:35:25] Metket: "They changed their mentality from you have to play the game for 24 hours to you can raid login and its fine"
[2:35:32] apheelia96: I figured thats what kept you playing in Shadowlands
[2:35:42] mr_kinky: Maw you cant mount Kappa ResidentSleeper
[2:35:46] JarJar_Brinkz: I played all throughout shadowlands. Content wasn't my main fun, but I didn't hate it in my casual time tbh
[2:35:57] Lewmer: @mr_kinky If you spent 3 days grinding Torghast you could :D
[2:36:02] lonesomecowboy: yeah my guild couldn't even clear Sanctum curve because we struggled to even get 9 people online like 4 weeks in lol things were DIRE
[2:36:15] murloc_kingkiller: do you think wow devs got inspiration from guild wars 2 for dynamic flight?
[2:36:21] JTshape: there is also other games to cover if one is not enjoyable anymore
[2:36:37] Lewmer: Is it the people or the game you come back for Tali?
[2:36:41] apheelia96: WOD was really my least fave
[2:36:45] JarJar_Brinkz: @murloc_kingkiller Probably, but Guild Wars got it form Aion?
[2:36:49] HazMatt_Prime: I still love you take on Ascian/ Emet Selch morality arguments
[2:36:53] Nerzalus: being a druid/shaman in the maw and looking at others without mounts like LOL
[2:36:59] ver_flashbang: SL raid fights and m+ wasn't that bad too
[2:37:04] apheelia96: lol
[2:37:24] Zerrahki: I was evil and would do circles around my friends in travel form in the maw. :(
[2:37:27] murloc_kingkiller: Castle Nathria was s+ tier imho
[2:37:34] apheelia96: lol np
[2:37:34] Nerzalus: I still love you
[2:37:36] ivashkov92: Is their BFA timewalking yet?
[2:37:37] dwolf010: @TaliesinAndEvitel what do you think the 2 new promotions are today?
[2:37:43] BaneOfTheFallenKing: I played until Sanctum, then I didn't find any reason to. Fun part is that I did the Maw/Korthia grind as it was current content, which I think is the content most people found unbearable
[2:37:43] apheelia96: yeah I still luv ya
[2:37:50] Lenitas: @Zerrahki This is the way
[2:37:50] weecree: Tali, did you ever finish endwalker? I remember you pushing all the way to Elipis and then it shut down. (i mention this to help your point, since it was around the period you werent doing wow content - but also im curious if you finished it?)
[2:38:00] emi_nya_hime: i loved nathria but it lasted way too long and the maw was just so awful in every way... and it all lasted for soooo looooong
[2:38:13] dwolf010: corruption hell yeah
[2:38:19] JarJar_Brinkz: As a sailor enthusiast i'm hopeful for this pirate secret.... I hope we get boats :) surely
[2:38:32] Bjerreh: get corruptions at the start as well
[2:38:35] DiscordianKitty: I am thankful to the Maw for killing the "we must get rid of fast modes of travel to make the world seem big and mysterious" myth dead
[2:38:50] Lewmer: Twilight Devastation from start would be funny AF.
[2:38:51] JarJar_Brinkz: @DiscordianKitty SAME
[2:39:00] bucephalos: They intentionally made a zone most people hated to play visit really bad idea
[2:39:04] murloc_kingkiller: Is every expansion going to have it's classic version?
[2:39:14] ArcaneSyntax: dragon riding is like the polar opposite of the maw.
[2:39:21] DiscordianKitty: dragonriding has vindicated me forever
[2:39:28] JarJar_Brinkz: Holding out for SoD classic
[2:39:31] neverbornlucky: Taliesin the sad thing about wow is there is  so much to the game but no reason to go back to old stuff unless you are transmog hunting
[2:39:34] Proxzo: Legion Classic!
[2:39:36] westvo: MoP classic is gonna be goated
[2:39:45] apheelia96: are they going to allow dragonriding and static flying available everywhere?
[2:39:46] Lewmer: Stony Tony!
[2:39:58] Fynale: @neverbornlucky you're here too....but you're not as...odd here
[2:39:59] Valestrus: i have been playing WoW for 4 years now. Playing legacy and current content at the same time (going through the legacy one in chronological order). My conclusion is: I think most of the story is good to be experienced as a solo experience in the legacy format and NOT as current content. my opinion
[2:40:03] Lewmer: You legit felt for Tony when you first watched that.
[2:40:10] Lenitas: That cinematic trailer was sooo good
[2:40:19] bomayaa: Tali, your hype for dragonriding is what mainly brought me back to Wow at the end of SL
[2:40:26] JarJar_Brinkz: The DF cinematic was a breath of fresh air honestly
[2:40:37] Atomicpanda: classic bfa would be nice. i could play alliance and get to have an actually nice hub city.
[2:40:47] Lenitas: I think the War Within cinematic trailer is a terrible expansion cinematic
[2:40:51] BaneOfTheFallenKing: UO, i liked how the maw worked as an annoying/hard place to be in (I think that's what hell is ment to be, right?). what I think wasn't good was making it a player power related grind
[2:40:53] Nerzalus: poor ol anduin needs some healin
[2:41:12] FatCatDad48: I called more about Stony Tony at the end of that cinematic that I did about the jailor throughout the whole of Shadowlands
[2:41:17] apheelia96: Iv been playing since Burning Crusade
[2:41:22] Zerrahki: Always my favourite part of doing a Dragonriding Race is just hearing that music kick in.
[2:41:24] Lewmer: When i spoke to Stony Tony in game and he mentioned people calling him Tony it was full circle
[2:41:37] tandemshoehorns: When your children were conceived, was it during good or bad expansions?
[2:41:43] neverbornlucky: Taliesin tar guest in ptr was great they ruined it in launch
[2:41:47] Trebled_Mind: Trebled_Mind subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 18 months! Shadowlands feeling so dire and isolating fed way too much into the reality of Covid which is what made Shadowlands even more egregious.
[2:41:51] holyzeke: I still want weekly story cinematics and I’m not gonna stop asking
[2:41:57] Nulgar: Until you tried Dragonriding
[2:41:58] lil_doreo: toy story ref
[2:42:20] thunduz: for me it wasn’t dragon riding, it was the customization of Evokers with gear. and I was sadly correct
[2:42:22] HazMatt_Prime: I'm curious as to how their going to do Dragon flying post Dragonflight
[2:42:23] ivashkov92: It really sucks because Torghast is an awesome challenge like mode that you don’t get in the game and they ruined it by forcing it on players and making it relevant for legendaries and stuff
[2:42:33] ivashkov92: they ruined a good thing..
[2:42:53] thunduz: evoker gear was the thing that was cool but could be shit
[2:42:53] awkswow: I wish they'd go back and iterate and add more to torghast and make it a prominent solo game mode
[2:43:00] Lewmer: @HazMatt_Prime They'll NEVER remove it. They simply cannot, the uproar would be hell.
[2:43:00] awkswow: But I'm guessing that's what delve will feel like
[2:43:18] ivashkov92: @awkswow 💯
[2:43:28] magisterofquelthalas: are those TW=Time Walking?
[2:43:29] JarJar_Brinkz: @HazMatt_Prime It's already accessible everywhere now
[2:43:46] Lewmer: It's forced content.
[2:43:52] Triskelian: @magisterofquelthalas Yes
[2:44:07] JarJar_Brinkz: Most stuff is forced content
[2:44:20] magisterofquelthalas: back from when certain legacy items would have their legacy effects enabled I assume?
[2:44:23] Lewmer: I don't feel forced in Dragonflight personally.
[2:44:40] Lewmer: There is no AP grind in Dragonflight
[2:45:07] ironfist423: I had to get that seagull
[2:45:20] Lenitas: Putting a reward on something, makes it so much less fun when you don't get that reward
[2:45:28] Lewmer: No - I take it back, having some of the lego' in content that people didn't do (ie best rogue one being in pvp etc_
[2:45:36] MikeyGy: and people loved torghast on beta where there was no grind with it and no affixes
[2:45:40] MatthewParks_: Torghast was still boring af personally so dull aesthetically
[2:45:40] awkswow: Double legendary torghast time was a good time
[2:45:43] Lewmer: That was the worst thing about SL
[2:45:50] Fynale: @TaliesinAndEvitel do you think they'd ever allow a mage towerified version of torghast, islands, etc so that there's more combat content to do that's not just one shotting things for transmog
[2:45:58] Metket: df has nothing
[2:46:03] Redundulus: really wish i could get all those warfront tints
[2:46:08] DiscordianKitty: I always thought they should have left torghast endless, and made it so that if you went far enough up in one session it was possible to get all the collectibles in one long run, and I'm still sad they didn't do that
[2:46:08] apheelia96: MAN its going to take me forever to get this Dragonscale Expedition Renown BibleThump
[2:46:16] magisterofquelthalas: I dont think there is any hard grinds in DF. It s been great.
[2:46:18] awkswow: In DF you're forced to login if you want to play.
[2:46:20] JarJar_Brinkz: I mean to the end of "If you want this, do this" I don't mean as a strict, you have to do something to play
[2:46:20] awkswow: Terrible.
[2:46:21] kpee_: kpee_ subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 49 months! You the best. Nice hair cut. Love you.. Netflix and chill later... the Silo is pretty good, you've seen it?
[2:46:23] Fynale: glyphs kinda for tindral
[2:46:27] Lewmer: The game is simply better with no AP grind.
[2:46:29] thunduz: renown is forced to get the full story
[2:46:31] Fynale: @TaliesinAndEvitel sparks
[2:46:32] Daetroxe: DF has no barrowed power so... none.
[2:46:37] dright424: The only thing you could argue in DF would be the crafting tokens at max renown
[2:46:41] westvo: I'm still bummed about gilneas in DF and wish there had been  timegated suramaresque gameplay there
[2:46:41] chronos789: you could argue professions are forced
[2:46:45] holyzeke: that 25 level one was great? WTF?
[2:46:58] Fynale: you needed sparks for power
[2:47:00] Merex760: I didn't like quest lines being locked behind renown
[2:47:10] neverbornlucky: Taliesin dragon flight is bad because I have to play the game to get the good gear I can't just skip the campgain
[2:47:13] Lewmer: @chronos789 You only need one dude in the guild to gain everything.
[2:47:18] Lewmer: Sparks = anything in game.
[2:47:20] SilverkissTwitch: @Fynale I never did anything for sparks and never felt the lack
[2:47:25] MikeyGy: max rep and kill endboss
[2:47:26] Fynale: you got them initially from the weekly rep quests
[2:47:34] CardinalTX: I wish 1 character could learn all professions
[2:47:38] magisterofquelthalas: ye what was sparks?
[2:47:55] Fynale: it was forced content to get the sparks
[2:47:55] grin1ing: farming gold to afford the crafted gear?
[2:48:01] Lewmer: Not having the request hub would perhaps call it forced.
[2:48:01] DarthTaz0: sparks also drop in raids and dungeons though. you don't have to do the weekly
[2:48:13] MikeyGy: also you dont have to have crafted gear lets be honest
[2:48:14] Vendrek: I love the new profession system
[2:48:19] HazMatt_Prime: I have been playing WoW since TBC and the gear grind is finally not enough to keep me going....I'm old T___T
[2:48:21] Fynale: you only got the catch up that way n ot the starting weeks of the season
[2:48:23] Dark_Lady_Looshkin: I haven't felt like I was playing catch up at any pont
[2:48:24] Lewmer: You're right. Catch up in the game right now is in an awsome spot.
[2:48:32] rhonins: yeah professions were not forced at all
[2:48:48] daodjinn: Visions was the best side content when they added the vender with the corruption powers torghast was a downgrade of it
[2:48:49] SilverkissTwitch: Sparks aren't vital
[2:48:54] magisterofquelthalas: I dont remember sparks at all
[2:48:54] SilverkissTwitch: I never did anything for sparks and never felt the lack...
[2:48:57] Metket: min/max ppl xd
[2:48:58] Zindrassil: if people wanted embellished gear
[2:49:02] Fynale: crafted gear was powerful
[2:49:04] DiscordianKitty: to be honest as someone who doesn't enjoy mythic+ i do feel constantly pressured to do it and punished that I don't. I find it a little frustrating that heroic raiding isn't enough because the best way to upgrade gear is through mythic+. it's something I mildly resent as someone who started the game before mythic+ so I never signed up to do it. but at the same time I also just don't really care about gear so I get on fine without worrying about it.
[2:49:06] bomayaa: never used the sparks once
[2:49:11] Lewmer: You can only use 5 made items too... so it's capped.
[2:49:16] awkswow: You had to have sparks for embellished gear which some of the unnerfed emblesihments were cracked.
[2:49:28] ver_flashbang: And if you're a min-max person you also know very much what you are doing (to yourself lol)
[2:49:42] neverbornlucky: Taliesin  think about how pay to win NASA is you have to get a good college degree to get a good job at NASA that is  so wrong
[2:49:43] Fynale: i mean you could say it's not necessary for any borrowed power grind but idk
[2:50:00] apheelia96: yeah I dont like mythic plus I prefer just raiding. I completely agree
[2:50:03] PicarusLoL: Have you seen belluar's video about getting transmog its fun alt side content to try to get tier appearances
[2:50:05] SilverkissTwitch: @Fynale I got KSM and AotC without even once using sparks so they're definitively not necessary
[2:50:13] CardinalTX: I have never ever done a M+
[2:50:13] cinnatoasto_: what is this music called? it's excellent!
[2:50:14] awkswow: Shadowlands dungeon pool was torture as well haha.
[2:50:19] grin1ing: @DiscordianKitty actually true. i hate pugging m+ as dps. and if i miss the guild m+ night that week - i'm probably not getting an upgrade from the vault
[2:50:21] Nulgar: Sure, but then you get r3 or 4 from the public order, so you HAD to find a crafter for the reforge - I've said it before and I'll say it again, let the customer control the output rank or get rid of ranks, do upgrades
[2:50:23] Nerzalus: You dont need to do M+ to get AOTC but it does help abit
[2:50:32] MikeyGy: also now each run gives you at least flighstones and crests so its more rewarding than shot or miss on loot
[2:50:32] Metket: comparing to shadowlands season 1 affix ( red thingy) vs 4 dps mythic pluses now
[2:50:43] Fynale: @SilverkissTwitch neither did I until after sarkareth prog but it certainly helped
[2:50:59] Lewmer: Removing the shit affixes helped.
[2:51:01] Lenitas: I do really feel that M+ pressure just by it's existence, my guild doesn't require it at all, but I still feel the need to do it :/
[2:51:05] SilverkissTwitch: @Fynale Fair, I didn't raid until this season so I can't comment on that
[2:51:06] magisterofquelthalas: Tazavesh was awesome
[2:51:09] rhonins: yeah
[2:51:13] lonesomecowboy: but i loved most of those 8 lol but mists of tirna scithe is genuinely one of me egregious pieces of shit ive ever seen in my life the only dungeon worse since has been vortex pinnacle
[2:51:19] cinnatoasto_: Hey Tali, what was the last song called?
[2:51:20] rhonins: it was pointless to do them
[2:51:26] chronos789: chronos789 subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 43 months! 
[2:51:30] Dark_Lady_Looshkin: bigger numbers go up more
[2:51:34] lonesomecowboy: but like theater of pain and sanguine depths were so so so fun
[2:51:45] Lewmer: Reginding plaguefall for the weapons :(
[2:52:01] Lenitas: I still feel the season structure is broken
[2:52:01] Fynale: @TaliesinAndEvitel also was boring when the same weapons and trinkets were the best every season so you had to do the terrible loot grind every season
[2:52:09] Fynale: now we atleast have some variety
[2:52:14] neverbornlucky: Taliesin when you buying a Apple Pro Vision ?
[2:52:22] gametimechumps: @TaliesinAndEvitel You and I are about the same age. Do you have a favorite IP from nintendo? I'm always interested in what other games you love.
[2:52:23] Nulgar: Instead of ranks, a good crafter could craft with a few upgrade levels already done, but afterwards the owner of the item can upgrade It regularly, without shitty recrafting
[2:52:27] DarthTaz0: Pepperidge farm remembers
[2:52:45] Dark_Lady_Looshkin: "sane"
[2:52:50] Fynale: "new season time to do nothing till i get my 2 gin'tokus again"
[2:52:52] DarthTaz0: I think it's hilarious that the Titanforge guys are calling for the return of Seasonal Affixes now lol
[2:53:03] holyzeke: stop reminding me of that crap Talie you’re making me ill lol
[2:53:04] lonesomecowboy: the wow community is kinda extremely doomed to have the most cursed ridiculous discourse happen all the time when like a few people who don't play the game at all are the cited authority on all issues in the game
[2:53:24] Lenitas: Gear progression is good, I just feel 'reset' every season...
[2:53:27] ShiftsEU: somehow it works in diablo 3 - farm almost exact same items every season :D
[2:53:42] apheelia96: I like it. Gives me something to work for
[2:53:43] lonesomecowboy: "THE GEAR TREADMILL IS SO BAD"
[2:53:47] DiscordianKitty: People know they don't like something but my god they don't know what they don't like. For example, the people who thought flight was a problem and we should get rid of it, when the solution was making flight more fun
[2:53:51] Daetroxe: @ShiftsEU hahaha, yeah. :)
[2:54:03] HazMatt_Prime: I have grown tired of gear progression just being 'more number gud'
[2:54:08] neverbornlucky: Taliesin what do they think a new expansion is just a reset of gear levels
[2:54:15] Nerzalus: cant wait to get this trinket again 14 ilvl higher
[2:54:26] Dazzaw17: gear progression is what makes me log on each season LUL
[2:54:50] awkswow: Maybe it'd be better to say WoW's gear progression is bad, because there's no interesting itemization to make you want to chase gear.
[2:55:08] Nulgar: @nerzalus that's within the same season, though, now you get different loot each season
[2:55:19] neverbornlucky: Taliesin wait Asmongold doesn't like you ?
[2:55:37] nenkaz: Hi Taliesen! Big hugs for you and Evitel from the land of Norway, Icecrown irl. 🤣
[2:55:41] ver_flashbang: As long as the ttk doesn't stay the same it never was an issue lol.
[2:55:44] Nerzalus: i was talking about different seasons
[2:56:15] apheelia96: I did like to level up and smack down things that used to be hard
[2:56:46] Dazzaw17: i find that boring
[2:56:52] HazMatt_Prime: Thank you for reminding me how much I miss Wildstar, btw. My unironically favorite mmo.
[2:56:55] lonesomecowboy: asmongold you owe pilav 500 dollars I remember the moment lol
[2:56:58] awkswow: Asmongold takes usually start with a rice grain of truth before he turns the rest into a burrito of shit otherwise.
[2:57:03] Zindrassil: lol, it was pretty fun at the end of bfa to go apeshit in dungeons 3 levels higher than usual because of corrupted gear. problems not withstanding
[2:57:26] neverbornlucky: Taliesin google  Presto Stuffler  you need this waffle Stuffer
[2:57:27] Dazzaw17: no, the previous comment of being able to one shot mob is what i founf boring
[2:57:41] apheelia96: if people would have just agreed with you all would be great :)
[2:57:47] Nulgar: He doubled down on a wrong take, kinda like Musk and others
[2:57:49] lonesomecowboy: it was extremely funny haha
[2:58:03] apheelia96: lol
[2:58:13] Zerrahki: The maw is amazing and I wish to live there forever.
[2:58:18] ArcaneSyntax: I disagree with you about hero talents <3
[2:58:26] MikeyGy: people on the internet take being wrong personaly thats why they attack people calling shills etc
[2:58:33] Nerzalus: The maw is the best zone in all of wow
[2:58:38] kpee_: @TaliesinAndEvitel  Remember when Asmon was watching your vid with the joke of looking for Mechagon island and he essentially made the same joke while trying to criticize?  that was funny]
[2:58:51] djalminnha: 2 palladins are mint
[2:58:56] lonesomecowboy: dude the ret ones are fucking insane i am a huge fan
[2:58:59] Dazzaw17: as a warlock main, i really like the diabloist one
[2:59:00] frankenfoot5: Love what? Sorry, had to feed my cat
[2:59:01] kpee_: Warlock hero talents are cool
[2:59:04] caradosailanthus: Wildstalker Druid is complete trash for Ferals
[2:59:05] MikeyGy: READ RET talents, they are BANGIN!
[2:59:05] djalminnha: herald of the sun and templar are good
[2:59:15] Kopro_II: They are decent i just hope we get some good visuals with them.
[2:59:16] apheelia96: yes so lame
[2:59:16] ArcaneSyntax: I think that it's not really like covenants, because the big problem with covenants was the permanent choice, not necessarily the power vs cosmetic thing.
[2:59:17] Nulgar: For the shitshow section?
[2:59:29] bomayaa: IT'S NOT SHIT :(
[2:59:30] cyclopsnerd: the one thing you'd expect to be green for the theme
[2:59:36] Zerrahki: Awww, do it! He's still cute! :C
[2:59:42] Triskelian: The mouse *is* the monthly reward
[2:59:47] a_cyrus_: full of bad stuff
[2:59:50] apheelia96: I dont like it either. just a stupid pet
[2:59:53] KatieRet_: D:
[2:59:54] CKinVT: I <3 <3 <3 the mouse!
[2:59:56] bomayaa: you're evil Tali
[3:00:00] Nulgar: How many times did you realize that today? At least twice
[3:00:01] McScooterson: why wasn't the mount the reward this month
[3:00:02] Daetroxe: Looks cute.
[3:00:03] Dark_Lady_Looshkin: 30 gold is 30 gold
[3:00:04] ramzie0: The mount should have been the monthly reward
[3:00:05] bucephalos: they rotate mount/transmog/pet
[3:00:05] neverbornlucky: Taliesin stuff waffles are the best thing ever
[3:00:09] dday_movies: speaking of mouse, do you have plans to see Dune 2 over the weekend? @taliesinandevitel
[3:00:19] MeggoArt: the music really ads to this
[3:00:24] geros2013: My major gripe with Hero Talents is that they tied iconic names to player power. So you cant be a Dark ranger without using that power.
[3:00:26] Proxzo: It's good to finish the log for the extra tendies
[3:00:27] Vendrek: I think they are the same suck hole as you have to have these covenant talents to do good output but with a crap catch...oh they are locked to two specializations...They are worse then for everyone that plays for aesthetics may be locked out of the aesthetics that they want for class fantasy/rp value.
[3:00:30] chryseis: It's not even a battle pet
[3:00:36] dright424: When they do the random pets, its more about the tenders for me
[3:00:44] GoldSmog: Saving the good stuff for when people come back
[3:00:51] TiredZubat: look at his little face his ears. just get the wee man poor thing
[3:00:59] Fibnkak: you know who would love that mouse. Penny
[3:01:00] Dazzaw17: i do my traveler log by accident most weeks. just happens while playing normaly
[3:01:00] Zerrahki: Can I have your copy of the mouse then? :(
[3:01:03] lonesomecowboy: tbh i like the mouse ill be real
[3:01:05] LolitaAldea: but you need the tenders for the next cool thing
[3:01:14] chronos789: there was actually a decent reddit post about how the traveler's log rewards have already shifted away from their originally stated goal
[3:01:17] Durwen: But Tali, think of the two year anniversary eleven months from noe
[3:01:18] Dark_Lady_Looshkin: 30 gold is 30 gold 󠀀
[3:01:22] Durwen: *now
[3:01:25] ramzie0: @chronos789 I saw that one
[3:01:55] bomayaa: I hope every month reward this year is a mouse
[3:01:56] Nerzalus: blizz would do it too
[3:01:58] Lenitas: That wrist watch a couple months ago was so bad as a final reward :/
[3:01:58] DarthTaz0: to be honest I hated the moose pet but he's grown on me. I think it's the way he sometimes just falls on his face. So i'm not mad at this cute mouse
[3:02:01] Taleniel: god we are so addicted tneTali
[3:02:05] Zerrahki: What if the 24 month reward is this same mouse and they don't tell you?
[3:02:08] Metket: you have 1 month come on :D
[3:02:22] PicarusLoL: Mouse is BIS
[3:02:33] Nulgar: Eh, I'm ok with smaller rewards, but the first couple months spoiled people
[3:02:39] NymannTV: How? do u not play the game?
[3:02:49] ArcaneSyntax: i did feb right away for the sailor moon outfit
[3:02:55] NymannTV: im at 900 right now xD
[3:02:58] bomayaa: 35 mnth??
[3:02:59] Durwen: I don't understand why it's the mouse and not the mount. Mr. Beast said they got swapped last minute
[3:02:59] Lenitas: 35 months xD
[3:03:03] frankenfoot5: 35 days makes more sense than 35 months
[3:03:16] lonesomecowboy: dude thats what my family is like in october and november kinda crazy
[3:03:21] apheelia96: My Birthday is this coming Monday
[3:03:24] Durwen: MrGM, rhat am I saying :p
[3:03:32] Nulgar: Tali: "February is not the shortest month this year"
[3:03:37] bomayaa: happens here too. I try and ask the others to move their birthdays to summer
[3:03:47] gametimechumps: Feb 28th - 35 days = Tali's birthday?
[3:03:52] AlanC2024: and pancake day
[3:03:56] GoldSmog: I'm feb 26th, basically family
[3:04:00] McScooterson: same here. from mid dec to mid feb it's something every week
[3:04:06] boomshroom: mOTHERS dAY
[3:04:19] FatCatDad48: Pancake day!? Please explain
[3:04:21] str4ysheep: still 20 days left Kappa
[3:04:46] apheelia96: I missed it
[3:04:56] ivashkov92: Ya I missed out on it 😕
[3:04:58] Daetroxe: First time I did it, and I loved it.
[3:05:14] CKinVT: It was. So much fun. I could finish a daily just by petting little furry critters. THE best!
[3:05:15] Caladin_the_Paladin: It was a big improvement over grinding for those stupid bracelets in previous years.
[3:05:16] scorm93: february-march is where the majority of birthdays in my family are too
[3:05:31] frankenfoot5: Taliesin hates love, confirmed
[3:05:35] apheelia96: brewfest is a banger love it
[3:05:37] Merex760: brewfest is my fav too
[3:05:38] bucephalos: 10 crafting orders 2 crafting quests give much
[3:05:51] Daetroxe: Did you read any of the romance novels? :D
[3:06:28] HolocronCoder: Saurfang's dies, let's all drink about it
[3:06:34] neverbornlucky: Taliesin tell blizzard to bring back the b word
[3:06:36] AngryInternetCat: Space banjo, lets go!

[3:07:14] ivashkov92: Hallows End is my fave holiday event I think
[3:07:31] Durwen: sound is baaaaad

[3:10:43] a_cyrus_: after this im not gona invite any shaman to my group, what a meme
[3:10:44] chryseis: Poor Thrall lol
[3:10:45] random_redshirt: "So I was playing on my shaman the other day..."

[3:12:33] HazMatt_Prime: I did laugh really hard when Evitel cosplayed as Lore
[3:12:35] KhrysW: @ramzie0 That eye is staying on!
[3:12:44] HolocronCoder: I still love the sideeye
[3:12:50] hexen109: That random Khadgar you use for the cutaways is too good
[3:13:16] Triskelian: I remember the outtakes from the Saurfang intro :D
[3:13:18] umagar: umagar subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 53 months! Happy 5th anniversary!
[3:13:23] ivashkov92: My other fave is one Uther comes and steals Invincible from you @taliesinandevitel
[3:14:41] Daetroxe: :D

[3:18:29] Chrizkit: do you*
[3:18:33] neverbornlucky: Taliesin it only matters if he is a zionist
[3:18:34] databob1: Sylvanas  burning things is the best running gag
[3:18:51] sterlz_the_ok: he sucks and is greedy for his own non racial reasons. Just shitty personal ones
[3:18:58] Daetroxe: I guessed he was, but I never checked if he was.
[3:19:08] Nulgar: Can you put Bobby away?
[3:19:24] Animeinn: So you do wear pants!
[3:19:27] Metket: magic!
[3:19:35] databob1: Nice

[3:33:07] Gr4das: Kinda depresing next generation has to live with outcomes of this shity era
[3:33:14] bomayaa: oh i can't wait for the next uk election
[3:33:19] neverbornlucky: Taliesin the one thing aussies did right is they fine you if you don't vote lol

[3:34:08] sterlz_the_ok: om
[3:34:08] aeson_of_raid_sock: president Asmongold denies your request
[3:34:19] markaud23: my wife is a green card.. I don't quite see the point to go to citizenship. her choice though. She doesn't see the value at this point.
[3:34:23] AlanC2024: anywhere in particular you would want to live in US

[3:34:47] apheelia96: its not appealing no matter what side your on
[3:34:53] kittysnugglez: It is foolishness to pay attention to something that is out of your control

[3:35:08] LolitaAldea: healthcare and education
[3:35:17] LolitaAldea: your childs uni
[3:35:24] vlaovich88: It is still not fun to get citizenship through marriage. You get your whole life inspected.
[3:35:36] caradosailanthus: Those are the reason I'm thinking of moving out of the US
[3:35:48] markaud23: @vlaovich88 Yes, that part was not fun for immigration.

[3:36:47] sterlz_the_ok: 50-100k ez
[3:36:48] Caladin_the_Paladin: @kittysnugglez Maybe if your priority is your own peace that is true. But for the quality of life for you and those around you are still affected whether or not you choose to bury your head in the sand. Thinking that it doesn't have an impact because you're ignorant of the impact is foolishness.
[3:36:50] KeyouiX: eh mine was 40k
[3:36:51] Demmou: College in my country is like $1800 for the full 3 years
[3:36:53] gronnlir: @TaliesinAndEvitel I'm 70K in debt from dutch education

[3:37:12] Divine_Miscreant: Depends on what you go to school for and where you go to school
[3:37:19] sixforate: You're more-or-less correct. Tops schools all cost $200,000 over four years.
[3:37:21] dright424: If you go to a state school in your state it is not going to be that expensive unless your family is upper middle class
[3:37:24] Gr4das: Hm Uni is free at Czechia, all of them are (the publci ones) and those are the best

[3:38:11] Badassbadarse: @Nerraw3 What is "board" in this context?
[3:38:24] markaud23: This point is very good.
[3:38:25] Nerraw3: @Badassbadarse Housing + meal plan for the cafeteria
[3:38:30] neverbornlucky: Taliesin don't forget americans hate paying taxes too
[3:38:42] gronnlir: my healthcare is just 180 a month and i am gucci
[3:38:43] peacefrog04: L America like always lol

[3:39:36] thunduz: yeah but but but freedom tali! did you think about the freedom?!
[3:39:55] AngryInternetCat: Freedom... If you pay
[3:39:56] Alkey29: Insruance / Pharmecutical / Healthcare has the US by the balls.
[3:39:57] markaud23: My parents have the freedom to go to mexico to buy their prescription drugs
[3:39:59] neverbornlucky: Taliesin at my last call center job I worked at people fired you for no reason to just make the benefit package go down and have to start over again
[3:40:04] Co1eCash: Healthcare and cost of housing are two reasons I'd leave here.
[3:40:21] Nulgar: Americans aren't actually that free? *Pikachu face*
[3:40:25] sterlz_the_ok: Live in the Massive Car Pog!!!!
[3:40:25] TyrannicalPie: The US talks a lot about freedom for a country that has very little freedom
[3:40:26] Sorin__: Ah the freedom to die of easily curable illnesses to keep yourself out of debt
[3:40:32] kpee_: @TaliesinAndEvitel come to America... you don't have to worry about the cost of birth since Evi can just pop them out in the bedroom

[3:41:01] Ryylar: I have to get out of Florida as soon as I can

[3:41:10] gronnlir: I would not want to live in the USA if i ever become a dad, too much risk the kid gets shot
[3:41:10] Nulgar: Yeah but you only get one internet provider
[3:41:14] Metket: guns are fun KKona
[3:41:14] Sorin__: What about bare legs?
[3:41:33] Alkey29: nopeee... guns make people lots of money so they want to make it easy to get guns.
[3:41:33] Trebled_Mind: You think Halsin believes in the right to Bear Arms?

[3:41:43] vague_pumpkin: I would also think about k-12 school in addition to college, American education system has really gone down since covid
[3:41:44] netonkent: Move to the south of Italy the houses are very cheap I will meet you there haha

[3:42:04] KeyouiX: lots americans agree with you on the school shooting thing
[3:42:09] gronnlir: @TaliesinAndEvitel but then you could move to spain or portugal or italy aswell
[3:42:10] lonesomecowboy: come to arizona it's a complete shithole
[3:42:15] random_redshirt: Could get decent Mexican food?
[3:42:19] dright424: National Parks in the US are great
[3:42:22] Caladin_the_Paladin: It's not silly. It is terrifying and heartbreaking every time. And then it gets infuriating when the same talking points get trotted around and then it goes away until the next one. :(
[3:42:23] gefuffel: Car dependent suburbs are horrible though..
[3:42:23] tandemshoehorns: Air conditioning!

[3:44:45] Sedoris: 20 mph around schools makes sense, u don't want timmy to get hit because he hasn't learned to look left and right yet

[3:54:45] ivashkov92: I’d like to go to a British pub if I had a chance to

[3:56:21] Merlock_Holmes: Millcreek mall, where they are proud to only have one shooting a year.  Not too bad for a gun shaped mall.
[3:56:44] random_redshirt: Many places in the US will card anyone who looks under 40 just to be safe.  Better that than risk the beverage license by missing someone who's graying or balding at 18.
[3:56:57] dwolf010: Did you see the new shop transmog @taliesinandevitel
[3:57:03] kpee_: @TaliesinAndEvitel would you say you drink more beer? in US, under age kids will mostly go for hard liquor.

[3:57:20] Nimsh: dreadlord one
[3:57:22] Sedoris: oh WHAT is it?
[3:57:26] Quachiri: They can loss their liquor license and people can get a whole store fired if caught selling to a minor, they're going to be serious about it

There were signs that banned photography.  I thought they didn't want people seeing how bad it was, but I learned later that it is the mall that they remodelled into an 80s mall for Stranger Things.
[3:58:18] Sedoris: do we have wing Viagra in the house?

[4:12:12] AnarchyMoose: bell just did a video about this lol
[4:12:12] Nerraw3: Spam +2 M+ and catalyst
[4:12:14] jimbowheat: by the 441 gear and catalyse it
[4:12:15] gronnlir: i despise crests in S3 though
[4:12:18] Nulgar: yeah, 10.1.X catchup was great, it's kinda lacking in 10.2.X
[4:12:25] seanstrachan: Good luck getting anything other than rings and cloak from those Weekly quests
[4:12:33] X_barley: You can’t just go buy a 441 helm I reckon
[4:12:37] OatsMate: Where did you get this set? It's perfect for DHs.
[4:12:45] Saiyori: is this going to hit the trading post later or just shop mog?
[4:12:46] Nimsh: Tali a thigh man tneKragwa
[4:12:52] Durwen: no thought for chafing
[4:12:55] Nulgar: worse, S3 actually made obtaining S2 looks worse, as you cannot upgrade S2 things anymore
[4:12:57] ArcaneSyntax: AT fields in wow, what a time to be alive
[4:13:04] Daetroxe: I just watched your video about player housing and liked it! But I'm not sure how Blizz could avoid doing an ESO monetization while sill having a WOW token. P.S. love the WOW token just don't think it could work with player housing if you can buy a house with gold.
[4:13:05] dwolf010: Flightstones you need
[4:13:13] Efendal: but how does it look on a kul tiran male?
[4:13:18] kpee_: @TaliesinAndEvitel tell me more tonight after netflix and chill ;)
[4:13:28] funviking99: oh no I missed most of the stream FallCry
[4:14:14] Daetroxe: No, I love the WOW token, I only can play WOW because of it.
[4:14:15] dwolf010: Tbf seems like most if not all store items are going on the trading post aswel
[4:14:17] X_barley: I feel like the WoW token is also entirely avoidable
[4:14:24] sterlz_the_ok: Very true, I didnt really believe that until you brought the point up and I started doing the easy gold farms. Its how I bought the War Within and game time
[4:14:27] caradosailanthus: Except the crappy Prime Gaming rewards
[4:14:34] Sindorein1124: I bought diablo iv with gold and then only played for about an hour :(
[4:14:39] Quachiri: I bought Dragonflight with WoW Gold
[4:14:40] ArcaneSyntax: I farmed a recipe early in DF, sold it, and then bought Diablo 4
[4:15:15] neverbornlucky: Taliesin but we want more pcock Mount
[4:15:15] KatieRet_: my bis boots are 300k gold
[4:15:37] KatieRet_: boots
[4:17:00] Daetroxe: Maybe you get houses threw achievements like some mounts in WOW.
[4:17:14] lonesomecowboy: my axe cost me like 400k gold dude it was fucking insane
[4:17:20] Ueberschande: people buy the tokens because proffesions arent worth it due to the botting :(
[4:17:31] sterlz_the_ok: Yep
[4:17:33] Daetroxe: Yes.
[4:17:36] KatieRet_: i'd rather cosmetics were connected to wow tokens than gear
[4:17:52] Metket: need lumberjacking + carpenter professions with that housing
[4:18:49] netonkent: I wish wow sub gave some currency for the store like eso does though
[4:18:51] KatieRet_: Depends if they have a cap on the amount of profit they wanna make
[4:19:18] Deatheran: why would a company "cap" profits? thats not how they opperates
[4:19:20] Daetroxe: I played ESO and hated how the store felt.
[4:19:29] bucephalos: lotro has a bad shop :>
[4:19:42] Th3myth9779: ngl i dumped like 600 quid into my house on eso so addicting
[4:19:49] AnarchyMoose: its ftp? its 20 bucks on steam rbn
[4:20:18] reallygoodtv: sorry had to go make sure little one was ok thanks for sub
[4:20:32] jimbowheat: Dont you get about 6 inventory slots on the free to play version?
[4:20:39] Daetroxe: It was not free to play when it came out, you had to play each month at launch.
[4:20:53] neverbornlucky: Taliesin show us the pcock mount
