[4:14:52] Renfuryy: theres 5 healers in this game
[4:14:52] Thuglyfe__: Can we see your nails? Light purple is pleasant
[4:14:55] Arriv003: purple was the color of nobility because of how hard it was to create the color for clothes

[4:22:03] Renfuryy: we have 4 priests 1 resto
[4:22:11] fknstag: dont need but I want them
[4:22:42] fknstag: 5 healers
[4:22:48] Renfuryy: so youd rather have me switch from being an impactful healer to a less impactful shadow, so I can sit bases with you?
[4:23:39] fknstag: i cant find even 1 healer to sit flag with me
[4:23:48] Renfuryy: Okay I dont understand then
[4:23:57] fknstag: not rn
[4:24:18] fknstag: just whenever I do randoms we get no heals
[4:25:14] Champjones9000: As a warrior I ain't making my pocket healer leave me.  We can 2 man caps...  Get em Red!! Ren!
[4:25:23] gamelifedotcom: You must have a drugee past with that nose bleeder music
[4:25:26] gamelifedotcom: Just kidding
[4:25:48] Elijahss: ALIENALIENALIENALIENALIEN
[4:26:13] Thuglyfe__: Ok Desi, favorite alcoholic drink
[4:27:09] Renfuryy: thats the most impactful way to play
[4:27:13] Champjones9000: There are 13 other people to go get caps

[4:28:09] gamelifedotcom: Monster soda srinks
[4:28:12] gamelifedotcom: Drinks
[4:29:03] Elijahss: 2 on any base is fine imo, except maybe stables.  I still ask for another when I am solo ST.  Getting sapped, and capped sucks.
[4:29:12] Elijahss: Especially if we have 3.
[4:29:29] gamelifedotcom: :>
[4:30:03] winghammer: Sup homie. Nice hat
[4:30:11] Thuglyfe__: Mine's probably simple jack and coke if I'm drinking
[4:30:12] Elijahss: If you are pushing for the 3rd cap then I agree
[4:30:18] Thuglyfe__: OH
[4:30:20] Thuglyfe__: HONEY JACK
[4:30:25] Thuglyfe__: YUS
[4:30:44] Elijahss: or spinning I suppose

[4:34:24] fknstag: that makes sense
[4:34:25] winghammer: CoolCat
[4:34:45] Renfuryy: Youd be more impactful than a random dps whos bad at the game
[4:34:48] Renfuryy: in a teamfight
[4:34:54] Renfuryy: so why you are at a base?
[4:35:29] Renfuryy: you would be as a dps
[4:35:40] Renfuryy: defending your role is basically just to call out when someone is coming
[4:35:46] Thuglyfe__: They make a Jack Daniels honey flavored Whiskey
[4:35:51] Thuglyfe__: 'Honey Jack'
[4:36:07] Renfuryy: Okay well i like small scale pvp
[4:36:16] Renfuryy: instead of being in a teamfight wherre I get focused and no one cares
