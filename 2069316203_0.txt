[0:31:31] Asynjure: Hello, good morning Sco. I have been following your stream for many years, I remember that I created a monk tank because I saw you playing in raid with one. What happened to those characters, do you still play them?
[0:31:52] sputzke: He stopped playing Brewmaster since Orgozoa
[0:31:54] TheHunter90: they are long forgotten
[0:32:07] Asynjure: ah, ok chat

[0:32:31] Matty923: so is monk shit, or just irrelevant now
[0:32:32] sputzke: jk he played later on too but Orgozoa one shot the hell out of him
[0:32:37] sputzke: Its not
[0:32:43] sputzke: Its ok
[0:34:51] Matty923: when is next rwf? any time soon or we chilling for a while? your last big post on stuff really made me super hyped to see what method has in store from here on out

[0:37:20] euanmcf: And a lot of squats
[0:37:27] sputzke: 3 times a week is only raiding
[0:37:31] Matty923: 3 a week id push, pull and legs
[0:37:48] linken1994a: So i had to remove the cds from my bar at the witches and i had to press into the spellbok. So shit show if u ask me xD
[0:38:07] Flao_1: @Sco is it better to combine chest + biceps in one training ? or chest + triceps ?
[0:38:25] Sikkbass: I heard push pull legs works for 3x a week
[0:38:40] Matty923: chest and tri, back bi shoulders, legs
[0:38:40] Sikkbass: but taking stuff to failure
[0:39:20] sputzke: What did you get from VAult
[0:40:14] Matty923: well, are you only going 3x a week due to time or logistics of actually getting there? could always do your heavy stuff at gym with equipment and body weight exercises throughout the week?
[0:40:48] Matty923: i go 0x a week due to a L1-L2 rupture :(
