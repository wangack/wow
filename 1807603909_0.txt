[2:21:59] Mallaes: He shouldn't be forced to play WoW if he doesn't want to
[2:22:11] ArcaneSyntax: Sloot would be 1000% happier if he wasn't doing rwf stuff.
[2:22:14] mavericks312: Blizz could drop a 10/10 xpac and sloot and his community will still shit on it lol
[2:22:23] Mallaes: Hope he'll get a reflection on that tbh
[2:22:49] MereMortal: True enough, I pretty much quite wow d/t mythic plus but still watch you for my wow fix

[2:23:23] rolando415: @theSalute love you and this stream
[2:23:23] joe_g_433: Maybe he should just play more casually. The RWF has to be a chore for him at this point
[2:23:32] Armdel: anytime you try and to variety viewers drop by possibly 75%
[2:23:33] PotbellyGoat: the answer 100% is no lol
[2:23:48] Nokterian: hell nah

[4:27:21] joe_g_433: He can still stream on tuesday???? Give me a break.
