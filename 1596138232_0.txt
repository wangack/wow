[2:37:46] Kineticbomb: Nothing new. Best way to beat AV as horde was at least 2-3 bunkers down and hope there's a t least 1-2healer at vandar so i would rogue tank it while using improved exposed armor.

[3:20:02] KeidooTV: horde loses alot of bgs alliance plays better unfortunately
[3:20:31] Ravenward: D:
[3:21:41] Kineticbomb: It's not just they play better. Horde rushes too much which results in a loss most of the time. You only need 2-3 bunkers down with 1-2 healers and a tank to win as horde. Problem is, no one is defending.
[3:21:57] Kineticbomb: No one defending was always the problem.

[4:21:41] MarkWaffle: Maybe skyflare? I think
[4:21:51] MaddyLif3: @the_bad_goat kinda defeats the purpose of a fresh server?
[4:21:58] GamingDad77: @the_bad_goat for at least 90 days from fresh server launch
[4:22:05] Sarocus: Meta gem prices are crazy. We need to help our guild JC in getting those recipes
[4:22:06] HaxzorJimDuggan: @the_bad_goat after 90 days of being up IF the server is about to die they will allow boosts but if its thriving they wont so dont count on it

[4:28:40] Frostfury: True KEKW
[4:28:44] srze94: wrath never died
[4:28:45] Ambersulfr: <3
[4:28:48] Streamcrush: DF hype is going to be muted because players are cautious after the last two expansions
[4:28:56] Valestrus: pre patch in 1 month?
[4:29:07] the_general01: you get them as you quest
[4:29:10] Tiamarilien: during the quests

[4:29:29] MrFuzzynuts420: you think a lot of the classic andies will disappear when wrath is over? or will they stick around on vanilla classic?
[4:29:53] Snabido: No one remembers launch months FeelsBadMan
[4:29:57] CapsuleCorpEmployee: Shadowlands launch was great though
[4:30:00] Inthezonewow: Just because 1 person isnt hyped for an expac, doesnt mean NO ONE is hyped LULW
[4:30:15] xdunpealx: has anyone ranked WoW expansion trailers/cinemas ?
[4:30:15] Bernly: Is the leveling bar part of an addon?
[4:30:17] luckfore: they're gonna level 100 characters till new classic drops

[4:30:21] dannyis1337: classic shadowlands

[4:30:52] xdunpealx: that was weird
[4:30:52] Zeuzo: clasic retail
[4:30:52] smashwow: when blizz stops making money
[4:30:53] KongoMonster: I just wish for a "new" classic expansion after wrath
[4:30:54] Foxxye: caint wait to classic shadowland
[4:31:02] CobraKaifromHawaii: maybe they start over after wrath "classic reloaded"
[4:31:07] Wassah: There out of ideas imo
[4:31:08] GonePostal101: Who wants Cata?
[4:31:12] 91Niki: Money is money
[4:31:18] pk99: Classic Cata FeelsWeirdMan
[4:31:23] MrFuzzynuts420: can't wait for classic BFA so i make and rogue stacking gushing wound KEKW
[4:31:33] klice87: cata...
[4:31:34] Wassah: Id take cata for the raids, everything else ehhh
[4:31:37] xdunpealx: i was extremely hyped for Cata.. that cinematic was top tier at Blizzcon
[4:31:38] Drogdorf: Classic MoP PogChamp
[4:31:42] Evilbreed83: classic would be more appealing to me if they were able to add cut content that never made it
[4:31:44] Whoisdaveeast: Classic cata pvp was nice! I remember your old TGN prot pala vids lol
[4:31:47] happyspot: I mean a lot of the expansions could be made better (MOP/WOD) just by condensing the time between raids
[4:31:47] MrMoistToad: hello Mr towel <3 odaKiss
[4:31:52] Groullock: Cant wait for classic Warlords
[4:31:54] Groullock: lol
[4:31:54] Apokolipz: Coming soon  Warlords of Draenor  Classic with launch day experiance  be stuck in your garrison for 5 days
[4:31:56] the_bad_goat: I would do classic legion again
[4:31:56] HaxzorJimDuggan: classic bfa towLets towGo
[4:31:59] Velashen: It wonât be popular. I think even wrath will fall off hard after a month. Who knows though.
[4:32:01] Wassah: Which blizz doesnt want lol
[4:32:04] xdunpealx: i thought Cata was good pvp, and Dragonflight raid was meh
[4:32:06] MrFuzzynuts420: @Groullock stop it KEKW
[4:32:06] smashwow: cata was fine. they just royally fucked the last raid
[4:32:07] ArcaneSyntax: all these expansions after wrath are just worse retail.
[4:32:07] Chr12x: people who never played cata before will want it
[4:32:09] HonestPhilosophy: Ignore Cata, do MoP with wotlk talents and no flying in durotar lol
[4:32:39] lockangoated: !beta

[4:32:56] Velashen: Cata Classic.. Milking a dead cat.
[4:32:56] Templexx: that war of the worlds sound
[4:33:01] Wassah: I just wish they could make a good game everyone wants to play. Hows that for an idea
[4:33:06] its_hekks: @Towelliee they should stop at wrath
[4:33:09] falldrgn: idk how you would ignore cata, it made alot of changes to the world.
[4:33:10] Epiclawlzable: I hope it dies here
[4:33:15] MrFuzzynuts420: classic wod would be a shitshow LUL
[4:33:18] Timothious: hope they dont force us to go to cata
[4:33:19] ProClicker: The one reason I want Cata classic is to build a 71 Archology twink
[4:33:19] Ambersulfr: wrath fell off hard when it was the only option
[4:33:20] Wassah: TBC was super small
[4:33:20] Lenietwitch: i woudlnt mind playing all the expansions in classic version, sepcially the ones i miss :D
[4:33:22] ArcaneSyntax: @wassah DF is right there
[4:33:22] Alienfromger: even wod classic? monkaS
[4:33:23] luckfore: mop please
[4:33:31] Penguinslol: Make a game out of all the cut content that was suppose to be in the games
[4:33:33] cigarette_butter: im waiting for classic sl
[4:33:41] srze94: would be cool if they kept wrath systems and just released new dungeons and raids from further expansions :D
[4:33:41] Wassah: @ArcaneSyntax kek
[4:33:42] xdunpealx: so far im having a blast in classic
[4:33:43] its_hekks: MoP was straight grabbage
[4:33:46] MrMoistToad: yea I want classic mop or cata that's when I'll come to classic ;)

[4:34:34] its_hekks: @Towelliee wrath will bring back more subscriptions then retail... bet
[4:34:38] ArcaneSyntax: I literally only care about classic until DF.
[4:34:40] Warspick187: How you know DF prepatch is next month though?
[4:34:41] abracka_: riot mmo waiting room towCopium
[4:34:41] Frostfury: Just hit 70 so what's the best way to gear up a bit?
[4:34:43] MrFuzzynuts420: oh for sure, any news of DF release a month after wrath will kill any hype for it
[4:34:43] CapsuleCorpEmployee: Same with releasing Nax at Shadowlands release
[4:34:46] xdunpealx: but.. if they were doing that, then why even survey about cata
[4:34:53] MrMoistToad: @fazerna actually so true. I also loved the dungeons
[4:34:53] Wassah: They use classic to push subs for DF
[4:34:57] HonestPhilosophy: No ones playing Shadowlands so bring them back with wotlk then they go straight into DF, gg
[4:35:00] imdabestmane: no interest in df
[4:35:02] MrFuzzynuts420: true, i know a lot of people just playing wrath till DF comes out
[4:35:08] srze94: ICC raid twitch content will get many many boomers back
[4:35:13] SerFloyd: Yeah I don't really get the timing of wrath and DF. I would play wrath for longer if DF wasn't releasing.
[4:35:15] Teknofear64: Hey T!
[4:35:23] luckfore: @Towelliee never seen that before ? https://i.imgur.com/eYxDQL6.png
[4:35:23] Wassah: They always used classic to boosts sub counts for investors nothing new
[4:35:24] happyspot: Playing until the 10.0 prepatch to level alts with the new talents
[4:35:27] themonbo: im just playing wotlk till overwatch2
[4:35:36] Wassah: q4 isnt terrible
[4:35:40] reggiepowa: I mean wrath doesnt rly have that much content on launch, you can easily be done in a month and a half
[4:35:42] Wassah: gotta boost those numbers
[4:35:42] Vanthe84: Wrath is def a filler before DF for me
[4:35:49] its_hekks: @Towelliee i know at least 50+ people coming back for wrath... non are playing DF... wrath gonna bring more subs than DF
[4:35:53] Collected1: unless DF gets pushed to Jan
[4:35:57] duffluv22: Theres COD as well around the same time
[4:35:58] noosphear: They are probably thinking that most people play Classic for a month anyway.
[4:36:01] msuVagabond: I played beta through Wraith, then quit.  I came back for BC and Wraith, won't be playing anything else.
[4:36:01] vimie: prob a financial decision to boost quarter earnings
[4:36:07] Eviltuna13: Iâm only playing Wrath because Iâm done with retail and Iâm on a 6 month resubmit so my money is not wasted until DF
[4:36:12] xdunpealx: DF will be huge first month, then big drop off like every expansion, Wrath.. keeps those players paying for a sub

[6:33:21] CaptainJoeyNY: Imgaine a tank that played like the engineer in Wildstar
[6:33:21] eskacat: People are toxic to tanks and healers, so another tank wouldn't have solved anything

[6:33:29] Dagomarus: Alot of tanks dont like be decision maker in mythic+ its intimidating to some

[6:37:05] egraves7: purely anecdotally, yes, i stopped tanking pugs when m+ became a thing
[6:37:05] CaptainJoeyNY: I started tanking in wrath when DKs could tank by smacking shit with a 2hander. If I could tank on a war with 2 hander or DW, i would tank on a war
[6:37:05] darthnemoy: i tell people if they want me to tank faster to respec tank
[6:37:09] Dagomarus: 100% there is a fall off, i know people who stopped tanking after mythic plus

[6:39:54] FragzNTagz: i started watching people after they pulled and let them deal with it. dps for some reason think they are supposed to pull
[6:39:54] Dagomarus: As a tank i look at fancy routes and try them and then the dps or healer screw it up, so often i cant do fancy skips or extra big pulls because people dont mass stun and stuff
[6:39:54] XshadowturkeyX: these are the reason i stoped maining prot paladin and went to my hunter / resto druid
[6:40:03] ItsMeKatie: I mean that's just the WoW community in general. Everyone wants to be a min/maxer and copy what the very best in the game do -- but they AREN'T the very best in the game and it's okay to chill and just have fun ð¤£
