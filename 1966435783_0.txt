[0:28:36] JonnyScotland: @xziyn I see, would take that to stay there though LUL such a nice place.
[0:28:42] kevmimcc: nice!
[0:28:50] mitchumtx: I haven’t had a pc since Diablo 4 :( it crashed my laptop
[0:28:51] king_julian_96: I believe they are I also believe we aren’t getting classic plus I think instead we will just get cata classic and that’s it
[0:29:36] mr_jimbone: excuse me Mr. streamer blizzcon is on November 3rd.
[0:29:40] Molvonos: @king_julian_96 Considering Classic+ is a fan creation, you wouldn't be wrong.
[0:29:51] Molvonos: OK.  APPARENTLY I NEED TO PIN THIS.
[0:30:00] mitchumtx: I’ll definitely be hooked on Warcraft Rumble
[0:30:00] Molvonos: https://i.imgur.com/8QqVsOU.jpg
[0:30:01] JonnyScotland: @mr_jimbone it's tomorrow for most people
[0:30:05] Rudric_Ice: time to put in 200 bucks in bnet today
[0:30:12] mr_jimbone: @JonnyScotland true LUL
[0:30:27] Molvonos: 'Fan Made Fever Dream'.
[0:30:28] xziyn: if you win you'll be able to add "Blizzcon winner" to your bio lol
[0:30:39] KingSlayerYotam: do people wants cata classic?
[0:30:49] mitchumtx: Nobody wants cata classic
[0:30:59] cruzeal: i'd play cata classic
[0:31:01] Molvonos: People want Cata Classic.
[0:31:13] mr_jimbone: I lvled a character to 80 just for Cata
[0:31:21] Rudric_Ice: sure people will play it 2 months then quit
[0:31:29] JonnyScotland: I didn't want it, but I want it now
[0:31:29] Molvonos: So like regular classic, gotcha.
[0:31:31] mitchumtx: Haha I retract my statement @towelliee
[0:31:41] kibarashi: id love cata classic. i started retail wow in cata launch...
[0:31:43] Sicknessqt: I'd get cata but I'm waiting for mop classic
[0:31:48] illidabbin: are you even gonna play whatever they announce?
[0:32:01] mitchumtx: Honestly I didn’t play cata so I can’t really say anything
[0:32:10] 123Sepi123: feel like vanilla tbc, wotlk is the real classic, cata onwards is closer to what retail is
[0:32:13] Rudric_Ice: i want wod classic
[0:32:16] FextraCheese: Hey @Towelliee dude, hows it going
[0:32:16] JonnyScotland: I hate wow classic. I don't understand why anyone would want to play it these days. Yet look at how many players it's getting. Same people will say the same about retail
[0:32:33] seedwolfmgo: sl classic what im waitn for
[0:32:36] xziyn: Especially as Cata classic opens up MoP classic, and that would be insanely popular
[0:33:05] 123Sepi123: Legion classic!
[0:33:10] gud269: Cataclysm: Deathwing Didnt Really Die
[0:33:19] Synk_live: I would just them to skip to MoP classic
[0:33:32] JonnyScotland: I would play legion classic. best expansion imo
[0:33:45] jonesyss8: Can’t wait for dragonflight classic
[0:33:49] Rudric_Ice: yep
[0:33:54] mitchumtx: Just open up all expansions to classic
[0:33:59] cruzeal: @jonesyss8 shadowlands classic Kappa
[0:34:00] Rudric_Ice: the shattrath raid
[0:34:01] JonnyScotland: The issue with wod is people hear the name and run though
[0:34:11] Day_Walker78: WoD worst exp ever
[0:34:15] xziyn: Would be insane if they added the cut raid in Cata
[0:34:25] jonesyss8: I might be the only one who played all thru Korthia
[0:34:29] HiImMelpi: I personally think anyone expecting them to "ADD" new content to any "Classic" version are coping
[0:35:19] allisonkielle: theres no way they will allow tokens to be purchased from a WoD classic
[0:35:20] Moobot:  Towelliee.com has all of your Towelliee news WoW UI addon information, and merchandise collection. Check it out!
[0:35:21] king_julian_96: imagine SL classic
[0:35:23] jonesyss8: It’s actually sort of worth $15/month now that we have so@many versions you get
[0:35:32] allisonkielle: that shit would essentially be a free sub
[0:35:39] KyleEverett: I couldn't do Wrath classic cause they cut RDF until it was too late in my opinion.
[0:36:08] gud269: ive heard ppl talk about like a Scarlet Crusade raid

[0:36:14] Rudric_Ice: nah i dont want an expansion for classic maybe down the line like in 2 years
[0:36:36] Skars111: people keep saying its going to split the playership more whats your thoughts?
[0:37:17] jonesyss8: Yup
[0:37:17] JonnyScotland: blizzard prefers retail players i guess, due to the store
[0:37:20] jonesyss8: Me
[0:37:27] xziyn: As long as they are in the WoW ecosystem Blizzard doesn't care
[0:37:27] KyleEverett: Blizzard says the overlap isn't that much when they said they don't worry about content releasing close together
[0:37:36] gellehar: I think more would play both if you could log in to both at the same time

[0:37:54] Molvonos: Retail's more likely to bring in new money, as well.
[0:38:06] xziyn: @123Sepi123 Cata had group finder though?
[0:38:07] Kuocolaya: i play both but i dont usually play them at the same time
[0:38:25] Zyricks: They had to get their screenshot in with the great Towelliee lol
[0:38:31] Xeressia: Was it infact ever "up"?
[0:39:07] HiImMelpi: @123Sepi123 You know wotlk classic has group finder and tokens already

[0:40:45] 123Sepi123: its so boring to watch 3 days of splits:P
[0:41:07] seedwolfmgo: i agree
[0:41:26] KyleEverett: I don't think I've watched any classic cause I've found it too slow.
[0:41:30] Skars111: Towellie is the best hype man  for new xpacs / patches etc love being hear <3
[0:41:50] jonesyss8: It was successful for SL
[0:41:53] Quakezilla69: with the end of of this season, ive been preping toons for cata, for fun
[0:42:01] Molvonos: People enjoy Hardcore Classic the same reason they watch Roguelites, like Binding of Isaac.  Something new, something fresh, and the terror of losing your character and that run despite all the effort you put into it
[0:42:04] Molvonos: Noita, etc.
[0:42:33] Sicknessqt: Ashes KEKW
[0:42:49] Skars111: haha
[0:42:54] NobodybetterPat: kekw
[0:42:55] Rudric_Ice: im waiting for ghostcrawler to announce his game
[0:43:02] KyleEverett: I wanted to play Wrath so much but I couldn't bring myself to pug heroic in chat anymore and I didn't like the classic group thing.
[0:43:19] PhoenixAuTv: I do hope Ahses and the riot mmo turn out actually good. I just want another mmo that not wow even tho i really enjoy wow

[0:44:31] Molvonos: "You're only working because you want money."
[0:44:52] fcsgamer: Someone trying to make money while doing his job, so shocking
[0:45:06] PhoenixAuTv: @Red_Fr0st_ plays like a single player game, no point leveling with friends which ruins it for my group of mates and me
[0:45:22] xziyn: How dare people like money
[0:45:33] PhoenixAuTv: and the game has server delay its not smooth like wow
[0:45:45] Molvonos: Those're the same people who bitch and whine that gaming companies want to charge people for their game/services.

[0:46:54] preznm: I can't wait for people to be left dissapointed when they don't announce classic+
[0:46:58] Red_Fr0st_: @PhoenixAuTv buy story boost, level classes in dungeons and side content with friends
[0:47:24] KyleEverett: I have some fond memories of the Cata raids, Dragon Soul was my first raid I really cleared a lot.
[0:47:52] smileyfrown: You only wear a headset so you can hear game sounds ParisOgre
[0:47:53] KyleEverett: Cata talents were also a ton more fun to me than Wrath
[0:47:53] xziyn: They rebooted the project like 3 or 4 times, so might have been an old version he got to try?
[0:48:00] KyleEverett: I know that's controversial, but I liked them

[0:58:10] lynkzies: Wy think about Blood DK in 10.2
[0:58:27] KyleEverett: So did you get any trauma flashbacks cause the Trading Post reward this month is Azerite themed?
[0:58:27] PvtHudson093: Morning Dude

[0:58:57] abracka_: @Skars111 look into stuff like lorex security cameras, non monthly sub and way better quality than the stuff like blink
[0:59:17] abracka_: vdh gonna meta the fuck outta m+
[0:59:57] lynkzies: Hell yeah that’s good to hear. Brew master looks so fun I haven’t had a chance to play it probably the only class I’ve never given a chance.

[1:00:16] Skars111: is PTR still up?
[1:00:29] Molvonos: 4pc Aug is gonna be fun watching Blizz try to nerf Aug into the ground again.  It let me constantly keep up Ebon Might without any downtime on the dummies.
[1:00:47] NobodybetterPat: what mob is it that ur trying to farm?
[1:00:50] Rudric_Ice: i dont know why they reworked DH instead of DK's, dks have been so medicore for the past 5 years

[1:03:37] yohover: Just a coincidence Kappa
[1:03:38] jmalmin: Deathwing is kinda everywhere. Fyrrak ate shadowflame and now he is almost infected by Deathwing.
[1:04:44] Tyldorx: I was hoping for classic+ or a classic fresh. Don’t enjoy cata
[1:05:17] PvtHudson093: blue world destroyer?
[1:06:50] yohover: can't wait for cata tbh, might actually bother with classic for once
[1:06:51] Densetsu_: If only Blizzard would revive HotS + their esport again during this Blizzcon. A man can only dream BibleThump
[1:07:01] Skars111: what do we get first week of new patch just new zone and M+ ? and raid the following week arfter?
[1:07:03] jmalmin: I got a feeling we will not kill the stone drake in the next expansion. He is going to go around cause havoc for awhile. When we fight void that is when we kill him.
[1:07:03] Tekfire: Tekfire subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 139 months! 
[1:07:48] Rudric_Ice: wod and SL had no classes or races will this new expansion also have none ? prolly no new class but a new race could be cool I wonder
[1:07:57] ReinholdtRanger: @towelliee dont you think metzen will present the new retail expansion?

[1:08:22] seedwolfmgo: should we try get highest key this week for a high stone 10.2?
[1:08:33] Densetsu_: @Towelliee please use ur connections and tell em to revive HotS, k thanks. :)
[1:08:35] RockemSockem0821: it is cool this time to watch the stream of blizzcon for free
[1:08:41] donkunn: end boss

[1:09:52] RockemSockem0821: is HoS still an active game?
[1:09:57] Densetsu_: There are no new heroes anymore, the game is ded :(
[1:10:00] TherealEvilgumdrop: @Towelliee i loveeeeeee free to play games on steam lol
[1:11:03] yohover: the only wow gamepass related thing we might get is like subscribe and get some epic pet or whatever
[1:11:09] Rudric_Ice: @Densetsu_ the game is not quite ded tho i played it yesterday and got a match in 10 secs lol
[1:11:10] Drelnar: HOTS was the only MOBA I liked, it's shame what they've done with it :(
[1:11:25] kochiee: there is a lot of wait time for ranked play in HoTS, but casual has always popped pretty quick, even in OCE
[1:12:25] Densetsu_: @Rudric_Ice Yea, I mean sure, you can still play it on a casual level. But there are no new big patches, no new maps, no new heroes + the esport is dead. But yes, you can still find people and play for sure.
[1:13:09] Alepouditsa: i can't wait for tomoro danHype i wonder what the new expinsion will be
[1:13:47] Rudric_Ice: @Densetsu_ esports  is what killed Hots in the first place blizzard just wanted to go against lol and dota but I definitely agree with your other points
[1:13:50] Tekfire: I've found it a little difficult to remember which unit counters what but otherwise rumble has been pretty fun
[1:14:17] Drelnar: they should get rid of the bnet launcher and put all games on steam at this point
[1:14:36] Rudric_Ice: @Alepouditsa its avaloren
[1:14:37] Drelnar: but they'll never do that
[1:15:11] Alepouditsa: @Rudric_Ice ohh the told us? i thot the keep it for the blizz con
[1:15:18] Dirtyfools: how can you know what u gonna face ?
[1:15:18] Molvonos: They didnt say anything.

[1:20:17] PvtHudson093: we need another mail wearing classs
[1:20:31] Ghostkai: warcraft CR sounds incredible to me tbh
[1:20:32] Rudric_Ice: @Densetsu_ disagree hots esports added nothing it was always a casual game compared to lol and dota and hots doesn't really have that  big flashy gameplay that others have where one guy could change the whole outcome blizz just kept dumping money on it but the esports scene never really grew
[1:20:47] Molvonos: That book's a lil wild.

[1:21:47] debaucherie: i should change my name on here back to shappi ngl
[1:21:54] KyleEverett: @Rudric_Ice I have complained before that MDI ruined dungeons somewhat too. :D
[1:22:13] Pippinn: it broke, thought i'd try something different
[1:22:38] RockemSockem0821: schimitar is the best mouse

[1:25:09] WinOrLearn1: NAGA, not NAN's
[1:25:17] funviking99: LUL
[1:25:18] Densetsu_: @Rudric_Ice I mean, the small amount of money in the prize pools did not help the growth of the esport scene. But, it did grow slowly though.
[1:25:55] Zansteh: mine double clicks sometimes
[1:26:23] WinOrLearn1: it happens, mine was jaust always the damn scroll real
[1:26:39] Alepouditsa: i allway have to to change my mouse after a year becose the start to doubl click it will ether be the left button or the right button
[1:26:49] TherealEvilgumdrop: @Towelliee ooooh il name change. lol
[1:27:18] Densetsu_: @Rudric_Ice I would rather say it was Blizzard that killed the game, not the esport. But whatever, its ded now so.
[1:27:38] WinOrLearn1: thanks for the tip, ill try it out
[1:27:49] TherealEvilgumdrop: @Towelliee im on altar of storms its dead out here lol
[1:28:35] WinOrLearn1: Has Towellie said if hes going to BlizzCOn?

[1:32:34] pavepawns: saving the drinking to christmas
[1:32:52] Densetsu_: @Rudric_Ice esports charts has some stats if I remember correctly

[1:34:35] WinOrLearn1: I literally saw an Asian dude with security carry in 1.2 million cash to buy a 1 of 1 Otani cash to a ~15-17 year old
[1:35:10] NobodybetterPat: not even enjoying the con lol

[1:39:05] Rudric_Ice: @Densetsu_ ok if I go by the numbers from that website I am definitely wrong in the highest viewership but it never really gained viewers it steadily declined but my point still stands but the games dead theres no point in arguing lol
[1:39:27] lithium364: serves them right
[1:39:28] NobodybetterPat: 2 for $150 lol
[1:39:35] Molvonos: Enough about the HoTS nonsense.
[1:39:51] Protectionplan: Rumble comes out when the showcase starts right?

[1:40:01] KyleEverett: It does feel weird this Blizzcon didn't sell out, but it's the first post covid one.
[1:40:05] Rudric_Ice: @Molvonos got lost in the sauce LUL
[1:40:15] lithium364: i miss hots, the first heroes they put out were actually fun to play and different from other mobas, like abathur
[1:40:18] Densetsu_: @Rudric_Ice Well, lets agree to disagree. Dedge game is dedge.
[1:40:57] Skars111: oh yea i was looking for a pass haha so they not doing it this year?
[1:41:13] Azerox050: Almost cant believe we know more about wow tomorrow, feel like christmass is earlie.
[1:41:55] Protectionplan: oh sweet
[1:41:55] Skars111: wait i think PTR is closed now? saying incompatible for me and some realms offline?

[1:43:33] Red_Fr0st_: HotS COPIUM
[1:43:48] necralia: i love rts
[1:43:57] DestinamueGaming: isnt hots dead?
[1:44:01] Tekfire: it seems like blizz has kind of given up on sc development
[1:44:05] Cicvara1: Do you see yourself hitting up Diablo 4 anytime soon or are you pretty much done with this season? @towelliee
[1:44:16] SuperLost89: warcraft 4 inc
[1:44:56] Densetsu_: Didnt they make a survey to "Reforge" the "Reforged" WC3? If there was any interest or something
[1:45:04] Murderingz: so lack of content ;)
[1:45:07] abracka_: @SuperLost89 we're basically playing that lol
[1:45:25] Rudric_Ice: phil will revive SC kinda absurd to me that blizzard had one successful  esports game and they decided to kill it instead lol
[1:45:51] Azerox050: D4 lacks content because its so ez af rn, you blast trough it in a few days and thats it.
[1:46:18] lithium364: after playing last epoch, the classes in d4 feel so boring to play for me :(
[1:46:52] Azerox050: Probably awesome when you play 1-2 hours a day, we are probably the minority experiencing this ;)
[1:47:24] Molvonos: The only thing that makes Uber Lilith hard is that one-shot mechanic that's fucking ridiculous to  try and avoid.
[1:47:30] JamesRyanXF: i want to play warcraft rumble so bad :D
[1:47:32] kyshen3: nope
[1:47:35] kyshen3: agreed
[1:47:52] Densetsu_: @Rudric_Ice Blizzard showing incompetence yet again with esports ;) 4Head
[1:47:54] KingSlayerYotam: D4 end game sucks
[1:48:01] heltvild: yea for sure
[1:48:08] Murderingz: so..lack of content KEKW
[1:48:16] KingSlayerYotam: im 84 now, but it seems like the season will end when i get to 100
[1:48:27] heltvild: maybe it will be different in season 3 when they add leaderboards and stuff
[1:49:17] Rudric_Ice: @heltvild inhale EXHALE
[1:49:32] BrensoTv: only one thinking classic+ will not be a good thing for wow?
[1:49:35] itshexi69: rip, i wish people did rares still
[1:50:01] kyshen3: yea so far its not a thing lol
[1:50:02] Moobot: Towelliee is participating in the Warcraft Rumblemania Blizzcon event on November 3rd! Make sure your tuning in to cheer on your favorite streamer. Check out the announcement video at https://x.com/WarcraftRumble/status/1717980850346766567?s=20

[1:50:25] Rudric_Ice: zaralek caverns failed as a zone just like korthia
[1:50:30] 9miracle7: classic+ is retail
[1:50:47] SuperLost89: @9miracle7 you have no idea lol
[1:50:50] DestinamueGaming: @9miracle7 oh?
[1:50:58] BrensoTv: is adding more content to classic wow like a sort of ''expansion'' i guess
[1:51:05] Molvonos: So retail.
[1:51:13] kyshen3: mount kill rare...mount kill rare content has gotta go though .
[1:51:26] 9miracle7: @SuperLost89 I said that because basically classic+ doesn't make any sense.
[1:51:33] kyshen3: Zaralek could've been so much more. I hope they start building more on the events similiar to the researchers. Id love for GW2 styled events in WoW
[1:51:46] 9miracle7: @SuperLost89 is an stupid idea
[1:51:48] Skars111: LOL
[1:51:51] BrensoTv: @Molvonos that's why i dont' think would be a good thing to have it xD we already have one
[1:52:04] NobodybetterPat: let me collect in peace goshhh
[1:52:09] Rudric_Ice: too many mounts in the game
[1:52:20] KyleEverett: I feel like the fact they're scared of making gear rewards from world content good is holding it back. Zones end up just becoming mount farms.
[1:52:24] Molvonos: "Too many options' is never a bad thing.
[1:52:26] SuperLost89: so them expanding on the stories from WoW Classic and opening new raids / dungeons related to classic is retail? if they add content not related to the dark portal, its not retail
[1:52:29] kyshen3: Yes!
[1:52:42] kyshen3: So many alt catch up systems i dont wanna hear any crying from altoholics
[1:52:54] 9miracle7: @SuperLost89 thats basically tbc, lk etc etc etc
[1:53:01] kyshen3: Events, think like the researcher one. I think they're doing more with 10.2.
[1:53:01] Rudric_Ice: @Molvonos too many recolors suck tho
[1:53:03] SuperLost89: how is that TBC? lmfao
[1:53:12] GLYFEnation: @Towelliee my man! Can we meet up for a 3 - 5 minute interview at BlizzCon!?!?!
[1:53:18] Moobot: Calm it with those symbols, @9miracle7 (warning)
[1:53:24] Effin_Steffin: Events + Alt = Gold. I love goooold
[1:53:30] Ricotje1985: i cant lvl anymore got have max chars to 70 xD
[1:53:31] itshexi69: The only roadblock is the super toxic meta in the mythic plus scene in this season
[1:53:31] BrensoTv: i just wish for an hard reset of wow retail but it will never happen :|
[1:53:48] kyshen3: bro

[1:53:53] Molvonos: @Rudric_Ice Not really.  I may like a mount, but dont like the color.  Recolors allows me to have the mount style/color I want, if it's available.
[1:53:53] kyshen3: you do NOT have to follow the meta lol
[1:54:07] kyshen3: I did 2800+ rating as am monk
[1:54:09] indica__badu: pugging your own key is the way to go
[1:54:13] Rudric_Ice: m+ was always toxic asf not only THIS season
[1:54:16] itshexi69: Its not always easy to just make your own group though if no one signs up lol.
[1:54:17] Skript: bro just listed my main classes T_T
[1:54:27] kyshen3: You do not have to follow the meta, make your own groups and you will be just fine.
[1:54:29] Molvonos: I bring my own god comp to my M+s.
[1:54:29] Plague_GG: Towel wdyt about the synthwave soundtrack?
[1:54:31] Angryfist40: no heals or tank
[1:54:33] Angryfist40: lol
[1:55:24] kyshen3: they aren't
[1:55:50] kyshen3: @itshexi69  what do you plasy?
[1:56:10] kyshen3: I mean i see Survival hunters at 3k rating so i don'
[1:56:14] kyshen3: don't wanna hear it LUL

[1:57:11] Molvonos: @Elizare towSip
[1:57:19] Rudric_Ice: @Molvonos that doesn't mean a horse should have like 6 recolors for the sake of ''content'' thats just lazy design sure if horses had different animatons/skeletons sure but it doesn't have that
[1:57:39] kyshen3: @123Sepi123  what spec?
[1:57:55] kyshen3: @lithium364  dude you may be joking but im dead ass serious. Make it happen!
[1:57:55] Molvonos: How is it lazy design?

[1:59:07] kyshen3: i won't go beyond 22 right now.. pointless for my sanity
[1:59:20] Rudric_Ice: so you think recolors is not lazy design ?
[1:59:29] kyshen3: even a 20ish at that
[1:59:53] Branari: damn you just gonna ignore me like that QQ
[2:01:14] volkreig: Playing any rumble this stream?
[2:01:30] Molvonos: Why would I?  Strawmanning something by calling it lazy design, when you compare it to everything else that's been released with said mounts, is fucking ridiculous, and makes anyone who makes that claim look like they just want to hate on the developer without having a clue as to how the game as a whole is developed.
[2:01:57] kyshen3: Towel.. any last 11.0 ideas. What do you wanna seE?
[2:01:58] Branari: rumble not even out yet is it
[2:02:12] Branari: thought it was out tomorrow
[2:02:19] kyshen3: LUL
[2:02:24] kyshen3: Oh Towel.
[2:02:34] kyshen3: I know there's something in that noggin haahah
[2:02:56] pavepawns: first raid is gonna be kobolds
[2:03:32] fcsgamer: lul as in "how did he know?" or lul as in "lul"?
[2:03:48] formal_____: is the new expansion supposed to get revealed at blizzcon this will be ny first proper watch of it
[2:04:12] Graveslice: Saw you farming the mount so I logged on for you. That was my listing
[2:04:13] formal_____: EXCITING!
[2:04:40] pavepawns: @fcsgamer i know everything.
[2:04:42] Dirtyfools: champion may i have a word with you
[2:04:46] ParzivalMcfly17: Are you currently for-seeing a lot of good news for classic+ ?
[2:04:47] kyshen3: I just hope people get excited. And not let  out a huge groan
[2:04:59] kyshen3: This is one of the few expansions that haven't been leaked. tons of fakes
[2:05:04] Densetsu_: @Towelliee How much have you seen from their new survival game? I'm sure you can answer that Kappa

[2:07:20] Rudric_Ice: Im talking about mounts specifically here, sure u can have 3 recolors of the same mount its fine I ain't complaining about that but releasing the same mount with another 5 to 6 recolors down the line of a whole expansion is LAZY

[2:14:29] Lamentz: There's also nothing of value to gain from leaking and a fucking lot to lose.
[2:14:46] pavepawns: 12.0 Demonic Ducks expansion
[2:14:51] MrGrimms: I keep going back and forth on picking up a ticket since they are reselling cheap
[2:14:53] kyshen3: Well theres been not many leaks this time around
[2:14:55] ReinholdtRanger: I wonder if theres anything “extra” about the next expansion because 20 years anni
[2:15:07] Ninwa: @Rudric_Ice Yeah keep this on the down low, but I heard BlizzCon is this weekend, our secret!
[2:15:18] fcsgamer: Ye but remember when they did it for Eye of Azshara to throw ppl off?
[2:15:20] MoistyBlizz: haha ^^
[2:15:39] pavepawns: @Ninwa lies! blizzcon is next year! we wont be deceived so easily
[2:16:08] ReinholdtRanger: @towelliee damn they removed the renown requirement for Pathfinder in 10.2

[2:18:51] NecromedesDK: get me some tendies
[2:18:51] NobodybetterPat: yea
[2:18:52] KyleEverett: Blizzard often does early release of stuff for prepatch
[2:19:03] KyleEverett: I personally am expecting them to tie Dracthyr class expansion to prepurchase
[2:19:21] eyeztea: cant wait for asmon to lose his shit over game that he doesnt even play
[2:19:31] kyshen3: algarian stormrider
[2:19:34] Sicknessqt: Algarian stormrider
[2:19:36] KyleEverett: Algarian Stormrider
[2:19:43] MrGrimms: @eyeztea He still plays
[2:19:47] vaironixx: khaz algar, algarian stormrider, hmmm
[2:19:53] Rudric_Ice: bird of thunder
[2:20:01] KyleEverett: Plus there's special "Stormriding" achievements with bronze, silver, and gold levels.
[2:20:15] fcsgamer: No tenders in canada it seems
[2:20:27] icon911: surprised they didnt include any with blizzcon pack
[2:20:44] kyshen3: The big names is Avaloren and Khaz'Algar right now. I still think it could have something to do with that damn sword out in sith
[2:20:47] Sicknessqt: Make some fake avaloren screenshots too Kappa
[2:21:07] Spaghettisaucez: what sword?
[2:21:19] luckfore: fake Kappa
[2:21:26] Spaghettisaucez: Kappa Kappa
[2:21:35] luckfore: we gonna see those exact images in tomorrows presentation
[2:21:56] kyshen3: what surprises me is the rate of their content now when i thought they were losing devs.
[2:22:14] Effin_Steffin: i'm just happy for the datamining to be done
[2:22:29] pavepawns: @Syphin3 the sword used blink and jumped to avaloren :p and stabbed the dwarves
[2:22:36] Sicknessqt: Probably BFA timewalking too
[2:22:49] KyleEverett: @Syphin3 That entirely depends on if we'll get a July-August expansion or a year drought.
[2:23:53] belfastcl: they bought proletariat, which was 100+ devs
[2:24:20] Collected1: we won't get a drought
[2:24:21] MarkoLee78: Is blizzard gonna stream blizzcon this year or do we need a ticket still?

[2:25:16] Collected1: usually just the opening is free
[2:25:53] Sicknessqt: No they said it was for wow team
[2:26:00] Collected1: i'm going to put Metzen up on my nice 4K TV and say "we're not worthy" repeatedly
[2:26:25] Sicknessqt: Maybe they will use them for "classiic+" LUL
[2:27:14] Twiello: kinda both
[2:27:25] Twiello: cuz cata classic will feel underwhelming to most i guess
[2:27:32] sp_dv: f2p wow inc
[2:27:37] Laffin1981: How do you feel about the whole Microsoft acquisition? Think it will be good for wow?
[2:27:49] Twiello: a classic + would be super hyped i guess
[2:28:00] Collected1: the fact hard core is so popular has to have told them something about where there is potential long term for classic outside of the predictable expansion unlocks
[2:28:26] yohover: phil spencer is just a really big candy crush fan
[2:28:28] Rimasr: Just make classic again with the graphics of retail!!
[2:28:35] piratechris: Expecting Metzen top give us Classic with new content is a fairy tale in my mind. So giving us a continuation of Wrath, Cata and MoP etc. is the expected route and I don't think he has leverage to do anything with that.
[2:28:43] sp_dv: dont worry they will find a better way to monetize than 15$ per month
[2:28:50] Twiello: i think classic is like the osrs of wow ( tbc and wotlk were cool but not so populair as vanilla i guess)
[2:28:55] sp_dv: like BATTLEPASS
[2:28:57] KyleEverett: I wanted modern graphics with classic vanilla gameplay honestly
[2:28:58] Rimasr: Is there? Haha
[2:29:12] Effin_Steffin: Classic 2: Retail Graphics + QoL
[2:29:31] KyleEverett: I was stunned when some people said "You can't give people a choice on which graphics to use because then players see my character in a way I don't want!"
[2:29:31] Rimasr: Idd @kyleeverett
[2:29:48] Rimasr: 😅
[2:30:05] NobodybetterPat: lol
[2:30:05] Twiello: would be cool if they listened to the community tho
[2:30:30] Shatraugh: everything i want will definitely happen YEP
[2:30:33] Twiello: yes and no
[2:30:40] piratechris: Please don't listen to the mad people! LUL
[2:30:41] Twiello: tbf a poll is kinda nice
[2:30:54] Xsidious: depends on what we say honestly
[2:31:04] Twiello: could F up the game but could also produce good stuff
[2:31:09] Rudric_Ice: Council is dead lol
[2:31:39] Collected1: it was nice to see Holly compliment OTK over their tournament
[2:32:16] fooxytv: I don't think a poll would work in the WoW community
[2:32:16] Moobot: Towelliee is participating in the Warcraft Rumblemania Blizzcon event on November 3rd! Make sure your tuning in to cheer on your favorite streamer. Check out the announcement video at https://x.com/WarcraftRumble/status/1717980850346766567?s=20
[2:32:19] KyleEverett: Or when they do react to feedback, gotta remember it takes them years to change course sometimes, Re:Borrowed Power
[2:32:41] Xsidious: did you watch the otk tournament?
[2:33:04] Collected1: don't they just invite a select group of people every once in a while to get feedback? or did I imagine that?
[2:33:20] volkreig: have liquid said anything about rwf yet?
[2:33:21] Moobot:  Towelliee.com has all of your Towelliee news WoW UI addon information, and merchandise collection. Check it out!
[2:33:23] Skars111: 300k?
[2:33:30] KyleEverett: Remember the poll where Dragonflight Raiding was the least popular content?
[2:33:30] Skars111: damn
[2:33:32] DubakuMatumbo: Tournament was amazing
[2:33:53] Collected1: oh I must be thinking of content previews
[2:35:04] DubakuMatumbo: Classic is just the goat WoW game Zug Zug SMOrc
[2:36:30] Twiello: imo best gearing system was back in vanilla XD
[2:36:46] Twiello: cuz it had most chase items
[2:36:55] KyleEverett: I'm fairly sure upgrade gear revitalized normal and heroic raid participaton.
[2:37:03] coldhandsbeatz: Gearing and general systems in WoW are at the best right now tbh. Dragonflight really exceeded any expectations there
[2:37:10] DubakuMatumbo: Gearing in retail is fine. But gear and power gets deleted with every patch. That is stupid.
[2:37:19] Collected1: LUL
[2:37:34] piratechris: Gearing in Vanilla was shit.
[2:37:35] abracka_: yes, 2 hrs in a dungeon just for the thing you need doesn't drop
[2:37:36] abracka_: very enjoyable
[2:37:45] Graveslice: or ninja looted ony
[2:37:49] Twiello: ye wasnt talking about the 2 drops per 40 tho :P
[2:37:54] Twiello: that sucked
[2:38:31] Xsidious: do you think getting 2 major patches is worth the amount per exp though?
[2:38:31] Moobot:  Help Towelliee reach the 1,000,000 followers goal. Click that heart button and join the Hammer Squad community!
[2:38:39] KyleEverett: I'm fine with gear being replaced, but I kinda wish all world content kept up in relevancy season to season.
[2:38:43] luckfore: why wasnt that a problem in say mop and legion then lol
[2:38:51] Graveslice: what was the name of the blacklist website for ninja looting
[2:38:52] Eregbueye: arent you going to get 480 from a world quest right away tho
[2:38:57] NBK_Sethus: the seasonal progress reset is really annoying, just hoping for a more consistent progression across an expansion
[2:39:20] DubakuMatumbo: I just can’t handle the. We expand the world and trash the old content Formular of blizzard. World is sooo big but also so small and irrelevant
[2:39:21] Moobot: THE new wireless Scimitar and Virtuoso Pro Open Back Headset now available! towLoot by CORSAIR! https://cor.sr/Towelliee
[2:39:27] Twiello: ye but paying either 100$ for 2 raids or for 3-4 raids is kinda huge
[2:39:31] coldhandsbeatz: Still I think they could have done a mini raid in a minor patch. Maybe they will in 1.2.5/1.2.7
[2:40:09] cripplious: @Towelliee you cant please some people
[2:40:33] KyleEverett: I would call a November expansion release a drought myself cause I just can't enjoy fated as real content.
[2:40:33] Twiello: well its good for business tho
[2:40:33] coldhandsbeatz: Imo the “fated season” doesnt count as the others. The reality of that would be almost a year from major patch content (10.2) to next expansion
[2:40:38] Twiello: ever 8 weeks new stuff
[2:40:38] Moobot: towHAMUP Follow Towelliee on twitter so you can be in the know at all times! | twitter.com/towelthetank towKawaii
[2:40:57] Twiello: but its not good for the consumer tho since u have to spend more money in less ammount of time
[2:41:20] Twiello: then again, with draughts u still pay sub fee
[2:41:30] KyleEverett: I really hope if we have no 10.3 the gap between 10.2 and 11.0 matches the same gap between 9.2 and 10 which means July prepatch
[2:41:30] Moobot:  Towelliee.com has all of your Towelliee news WoW UI addon information, and merchandise collection. Check it out!
[2:41:42] coldhandsbeatz: So when are you expecting the expansion? Like I said if its Oct/Nov its basically a year from major patch content (now) to 11.0
[2:41:50] Twiello: any math teacher in here?
[2:42:09] Twiello: tbf for wod yes
[2:42:19] DubakuMatumbo: @towelliee it is really hard to find the middle point for everyone. But what definitely is missing, is the mmo social aspect of the game.
[2:42:26] abracka_: $100 + $15 month sub for 1 1/2 - 2 years of steady content, that you'll spend roughly a few hundred hours playing
[2:42:29] abracka_: bad deal KEKW
[2:42:43] Thundryk: i just hope it doesn't break the devs in terms of workload
[2:42:56] mavericks312: Df was so clean when we first saw it
[2:43:03] olicarvini: towelliee give me a timecard please?
[2:43:21] Xsidious: df alpha wasnt even alpha played like a beta imo
[2:43:40] KyleEverett: 6 months of fated I would definitely take a break, but if that's what we're getting at least I'd have Dawntrail to fill the gap next summer.
[2:43:40] Rudric_Ice: timecard = gametime
[2:44:03] olicarvini: yeah
[2:44:06] olicarvini: hahah
[2:44:27] KyleEverett: I remember MoP beta. I got in late and the Crane temple in Krasarang was entirely untextured. Was a trip
[2:44:46] luckfore: towelliee pay my rent please?
[2:44:51] Thoreya: Mornin gang
[2:44:56] Thoreya: 1 more day
[2:45:15] Effin_Steffin: DF been smooth from Launch
[2:45:27] kochiee: did u end up getting arfus from hallow's end?
[2:45:35] Feierabend420: MOP was best expansion - haters gonna hate
[2:45:42] irishbsd: 'd love to see more open world pvp objectives
[2:45:53] Twiello: damn right its the best expansion!
[2:46:09] Thoreya: Bfa warmode >
[2:46:13] Erielle04: Devs don't seem to care about pvp
[2:46:21] zysmos: to be fair i love bgs
[2:46:23] irishbsd: I don't love arena but war in warcraft would be cool :)
[2:46:25] mavericks312: imagine thinking is a focus of theres lol
[2:46:25] KyleEverett: Shadowlands killed Warmode so hard. :D
[2:46:29] Thoreya: Idk Morgan day always talks about pvp in every interview lol
[2:46:29] zysmos: i'd love them to focus on that more
[2:46:30] NBK_Sethus: BFA zone invasions were cool, idk why they gave up on that
[2:46:31] Densetsu_: Would like to see some more mini-raids/new dungeons inbetween bigger patches.
[2:46:47] piratechris: Devs don't care much about PvP because most of the player base doesn't care about PvP
[2:46:50] tumtillion: What class you gonna play with for the blitz?
[2:47:04] KyleEverett: @Densetsu_ Oh man, DF definitely needed more patch dungeons than just the megadungeon.
[2:47:05] D3ception: The timer is for a blizzcon opening, not WoW presentation, right?
[2:47:39] Thoreya: Solo que for arena
[2:47:46] ReinholdtRanger: @D3ception Correct
[2:47:48] Streamcrush: they do eff all for pvp unless it's arena, it's always half baked at best even when they try
[2:48:02] Panasonic82: Buying gear with Honor and Conquest was introduced in SL
[2:48:09] Xsidious: they should do a free 4 all match lol
[2:48:19] gvozdeni90: Solo Q was fun in shadowland, no is just pain in ass
[2:48:38] D3ception: Yeah, but WoW presentation is 1.5h later
[2:48:48] KyleEverett: Crystalline Conflict is decently popular for FF14. They just added a new map this week for it.
[2:48:53] DubakuMatumbo: I sadly agree
[2:48:55] Rudric_Ice: nobody is talking about overwatch I find it so hilarious what a sad state of affairs lol
[2:49:12] Streamcrush: old school wow pvp was fun, balance was broken and that's what made it good
[2:49:36] coldhandsbeatz: Are you watching the Opening Ceremony here then streaming?

[2:49:48] dracullus: there is no panel 1.5  hour after opening ceremony, I think it could be hidden right now for new IP
[2:50:02] KyleEverett: Blizzard trying to do a K/DA but like 4 years too late.
[2:50:08] Mendo_ksi: Maybe there only of the fraction of the people doing pvp because pvp content is not engaging for players, and if the finf a good formula people will come back to pvpv ? :p
[2:50:10] Densetsu_: Atleast 10 Kappa
[2:50:26] dracullus: oh nvm I see it changed
[2:51:18] Mendo_ksi: if you dont have competitive players, why is there mythic plus content ? pretty competitve no ?
[2:51:40] Densetsu_: Many probably changed PvP game from WoW. There are so many better choices nowadays if you want a competitive game.

[2:53:59] zysmos: I think the problem is that every rewards are tied to arena and nobody likes arena
[2:54:15] Rudric_Ice: which should have happened 10 years ago
[2:54:40] dracullus: I hope solo bg will count toward artifact skin and I finally complete collection after 10 years xD

[2:56:40] Rudric_Ice: isn't ashes a full pvp game ? like end game so it might be DOA  new world was pvp now they finally adding some pve. MMO focused PVP games die really quick
[2:56:49] dracullus: we still will have at least timewalking patch
[2:57:11] dracullus: bfa
[2:57:19] luckfore: SoO timewalking
[2:57:55] Rudric_Ice: 5hrs minimum
[2:58:06] NickyNiclas: Maybe they'd split it in two
[2:58:28] ShinoaKurisu: ye was firelands
[2:58:37] Darkbane55: throne of thunder <3
[2:58:42] dracullus: maybe it will be just LFR split into wings
[2:58:47] abracka_: they need to make those timewalking raids queueable instead of needing a premade group
[2:59:03] luckfore: SoO timewalking stuff was datamined a while ago
[2:59:04] NickyNiclas: Throne of thunder is also long
[2:59:29] Rudric_Ice: what about Highmaul ?
[3:00:00] dracullus: and with that looong trash and horrible first fight
[3:01:28] Rudric_Ice: legion should be nighthold and bfa should be battle of dazaralor
