[1:23:41] kingceejay90: if its not gonna be gear, then it should be cosmetics drops, cant just be a challenge with no reward
[1:23:45] Gingerprimer: Also most ppl raid for Gear wow is a Gear grinding foucused game
[1:23:54] remedyt: people looking at ffxiv highest teir content not giving gear and saying itll fix mythic

[1:25:52] Ramzilla92: i just want 10man mythic..  but quess it would be hard to balance
[1:25:55] Niksen_99: in vanilla the raid were not hard.. it was hard managing 40 people KEKW
[1:26:03] nephttv_: Mist

[1:26:20] Deadelus0: @Niksen_99 agreed
[1:26:31] mmo_kenna_: we have 4 raid difficulties these days, it's insane really
[1:26:52] nvnto: I think one problem with Mythic raiding now is not the raid size itself, but the way the Mythic lockout works. Nobody is gonna waste an entire ID for a guild that's missing one person for their progression that night.
[1:26:59] Respls: yup
[1:27:26] Gingerprimer: He said that as counter argument to the Make mythic a prestige title only
[1:27:36] traffmanmarc: good morning all you beautiful people
[1:27:51] skewlbeta: I think gear is important, but at the same time I think the permanence of mounts and mogs is a bigger draw for me personally, but I don't push keys/raid/pvp too much, beyond getting enough gear to do the things I want to do.

[1:29:29] skewlbeta: right? no one will take your mount away. your mounts and mogs will never be obselete
[1:29:32] Respls: could be 1 ilvl and people would do mythic

[1:33:51] Gingerprimer: @NVNTO yes
[1:34:03] mmo_kenna_: So they need a system that makes it harder the few weeks for RWF then people get a boost after to help them. they kinda tried that with double leggo
[1:34:12] Hypertitan: all I'm seeing is apart from the race being too long....for a few weeks after it was largely considered a very good raid.  Then people started finding other stuff to bitch about as time went on
[1:34:18] ronny_84: would you say this is a result of not being able to test the boss on ptr ?
[1:34:22] RageerPLZ: Feels like the tier was short, even though I know it wasn't we should be at the last boss normally around this time, now we are at lords.

[1:38:03] AureliusXV: you should just do the puzzle lol
[1:38:08] RageerPLZ: So was not testing the last 3 bosses worth it?
[1:38:30] Gingerprimer: Yes they clearly have a goal of how many ppl they want to be able to do content
[1:38:37] skewlbeta: I hope we get S4 soon.
[1:38:57] Gingerprimer: @RageerPLZ other bosses also got nerfed hard like Halondrus and Anduin
[1:39:19] Snabido: Because of S4, init?
[1:39:19] Wcvechten: Also, all these nerfs will transfer over to season 4 during fated weeks
[1:39:26] nvnto: Anduin received 77 nerfs over all difficulties since release.
[1:39:43] Hypertitan: i feel like if this was a raid tier in bfa it wouldn't have been nerfed this much.  I think it's a shift in design philosophy
[1:39:47] Koolsouthpaw: are you....are you playing priest?
[1:40:32] Gingerprimer: @Hypertitan also in BFA we also had tons of borrowed power the later you got into a tier
[1:40:56] Yagr6: how can we assume what stance they take until the next raid comes out?
[1:41:03] Hypertitan: I'm saying they're just trying get more people kills as the patch goes on...I don't think this is going to be an isolated deal
[1:41:08] Electafuzz: borrowed systems
[1:41:15] zysmos: just tune the bosses it can be killed with way less ilvl then
[1:41:16] byrdeen45: but they all bitched about borrowed power
[1:41:38] Snabido: We'll find out when alpha is around I guess. Suprise corruption comeback, "infusions" üòè
[1:41:46] Gingerprimer: perpetual incresing power is prob the phrase
[1:41:57] Darwoo: afternoon you sexy beasts
[1:42:00] Yagr6: they have always nerfed raids
[1:42:07] MackPlays: They should keep the raids difficult so it‚Äôs more of an accomplishment
[1:42:20] mmo_kenna_: And once your maxed out and power and still can't kill shouldn't that be ok?
[1:42:22] Wcvechten: should they do it like with ICC or during MOP raids? just a flat %nerf to everything after a while
[1:42:23] Darwoo: whats the gossip from the chinese release of immortal? anyone know what happened?
[1:42:25] mwchaos: something they talked about is that before they were just turning knobs where as now theyre nerfing mechanics so it seems harsher than other tiers
[1:42:28] HulkeenRS: Question to you Towelliee: What do you think about Dungeon Finder not being in WOTLK, do you think its a good decision seeing as there is already a verison of the game that has it?
[1:42:36] callum_bm: @Towelliee whats your thought on weak auras & addons and how they design raids around them
[1:42:37] clambynature: @Towelliee Later Dude.
[1:42:39] mavericks312: i actually think the tuning was fine a last tier raid should be difficult
[1:42:39] brobb41: always better to have it too hard and come down a little than to be to easy no one is going to like ya making it harder
[1:42:58] Hypertitan: i guess....i just think they're going to keep it a little more heavy handed than they used to.  this tier just had their fuck ups on top of it
[1:43:06] NieIas: yea in legion they started making raids very hard
[1:43:09] mavericks312: but if bosses just fell over ppl would complain as well
[1:43:26] HaxzorJimDuggan: maybe going into DF knowing that there wont be any borrowed power or double legos they can hit closer to the mark, there was probably too many variable still for sepulcher
[1:43:27] Darwoo: do you reckon the devs clear the bosses first? or they work out the completion from equations?
[1:43:39] PhillyDilly18: Do you think that if a raid is too overtuned/difficult now, it could have an unintended side effect of players not bothering with future raids? outside of RWF of course
[1:44:27] mwchaos: no?
[1:44:35] HulkeenRS: @callum_bm you didnt ask me, but in any game where you develop content around Plugins/addons, its a massive slippery slope. getting new players into that setting trying stuff without having these addons would be very confusing.
[1:44:43] Hypertitan: I feel that's a them problem....if they feel that way it's on them
[1:44:45] HulkeenRS: Question to you Towelliee: What do you think about Dungeon Finder not being in WOTLK, do you think its a good decision seeing as there is already a verison of the game that has it? @Towelliee

[1:46:02] Mojojojodota: Compare the logs of Sepulcher normal + heroic + mythic to TBC Classic with Sunwell. Retail raiding is doing atrociously.

[1:49:49] Warblade23: they nerf sofo every time ion's cant kill a boss :p
[1:49:51] HaxzorJimDuggan: they would need to find a way to stop split runs if it was tuned for everyone then the 1% doing splits runs would just decimate it
[1:49:51] Broomba: Blizzard catering to top raid guilds and casual players. It‚Äôs a quandary

[1:50:15] polishguy734: Noob here. What‚Äôs the difference between Raiding and Mythic+?
[1:50:20] brobb41: still tons of guilds working on heroic jailer lol
[1:50:27] Mojojojodota: RWF success and hype does not translate into success for the game though, this expansion has been proof of that. WoW was at the most successful during Wrath where raiding was the easiest. Sepulcher the hardest raid in the history of WoW has the worst participation since Naxx vanilla.
[1:50:35] Respls: they nurfed the raid while they were proging in race to world first
[1:50:55] Axeum: axeumHug axeumEhehe axeumHappy
[1:51:12] Mojohusk: @polishguy734 Mythic+ are dungeons of increasingly stronger difficulty.
[1:51:20] Hypertitan: @Respls they always make changes during race...that's not unusual
[1:51:23] CardinalTX: @Towelliee i know WoW keeps you very busy but is there anything you feel ESO needs that would keep you playing it more?
[1:51:59] TacDuc: The hard thing about balancing stuff in multiplayer games is that people have different skills, and if you change one thing, you change it for both top and bottom players. And that is why there are different difficulties. And yes, even the way the top guilds struggled this RWF, the raid seemed a bit too difficult, lots of people burned out

[1:53:46] Ety_TV: i think blizz should reconsider and do mythic raiding flexible (similar to nm and hc). Having 22 ppl and bench 2 or having 18 and cancel the raid is not a good option for the modern gamers and games
[1:53:49] LiveJuniorr: How do you make it so I can see quests like that on the right hand side of my screen?

[1:55:59] michaelmm: Isn't getting gear from M+ and then doing Mythic raids what a lot of players do anyway?
[1:56:02] nephttv_: I raid for gear so I can push mythic plus
[1:56:03] KaisenSiru: Gear and that Hall of Fame rank prestige
[1:56:04] vadermug: catchup mechanics XD
[1:56:04] CoffeeDMG: feels so good to be a powerful prot paladin right now. throwin' 1000 shields.
[1:56:04] Juerrilla: because the expansion is fixed in patch x.3 LUL
[1:56:59] Grondmasterr: how about mythic raiding dropping Valor only, so you can upgrade heroic to higher level?
[1:57:14] mavericks312: also you change mythic to cosmetic only you risk killing that difficulty
[1:57:17] Hypertitan: that's true.  I'm pretty 50/50 on the whole thing really.  But you're probably right with the power
[1:57:20] mario32: wuz up @Towelliee im turning 35 in june 27 almosst my birthday

[1:57:56] Ety_TV: i dont play many other games but the games I play never require more then 8 ppl to do raid content
[1:58:04] Gingerprimer: @jaetandewae yes but then you are missing out on the actual best gear in the game which comes from the last few bosses
[1:58:09] seriousalsa: Why dont they want to reduce raid size? More world first competition and I dont have to worry about 19 people wiping our group
[1:58:11] Juerrilla: so wouldn't having a lower ceiling open the door for more people?
[1:58:15] mario32: @polishguy734 congrats happy late birthday

[2:17:45] captiv8: do you want them to say sorry?
[2:18:09] MortalLesuj: @towelliee I think it‚Äôs more to do with tuning for both top end, low end, plus everyone in between without a power creep after double lego was unlocked.

[2:29:45] haderdaraide: !wrath
[2:29:45] Blvdman: I do hope for DragonFlight they add pity tokens to M+ and Raid bosses, feels soo shitty to put in work and not get something to help progress your char, even a tiny bit.
[2:30:04] haderdaraide: Whats your prediction for wrath release?
[2:30:08] The_Metal_Man: valours kinda like that
[2:30:19] acehornet2: towelliee knows 100 percent when it comes out
[2:30:29] mavericks312: like badges?

[2:30:39] Kalistraza: @Blvdman didn't diablo immortal show you where they are heading?)
[2:30:42] Blvdman: If you don't get loot, you get a token or something then you gather up like 30 of them and can forge a piece
[2:30:42] Yagr6: id rather there be mats for your current professions at the end of dungeons
[2:30:51] Djfarmville: justice points comeback PogChamp

[2:31:32] NieIas: thats what theyre doing in season 4 lul
[2:31:40] Mecabeast: maybe like a token like wrath raids?
[2:31:48] Yagr6: profession mats at end of dungeon please
[2:31:57] nephttv_: a gear vendor would be dope
[2:32:01] Korupcija_: ye but the dopamine hit
[2:32:04] Blvdman: I guess pity if the wrong word for it, but something that guarentee's you get something for your time you put into raid, even if you didnt get loot
[2:32:04] mmo_kenna_: creation catalyst was the bad luck protection for tier
[2:32:11] abracka_: @Neph__98 badge of justice return pls
[2:32:16] TacDuc: I would be fine with it if the game tracked your dungeon drops and just gave you a pity drop if you didn't get one after like 5 dungeons. Speaking as someone with 0 luck
[2:32:21] nephttv_: @Neph__98 tru
[2:32:23] VanishSHRoguE: @Towelliee the system they implementing in s4 might be even better but only allow it for non weapons IMO or possibly a method to pick 1 piece non weapon with tertiaries and a socket
[2:32:26] The_Metal_Man: @mmo_kenna_ creation catalyst is fantastic, I hope they keep it

[2:32:53] Korupcija_: they're like 10-20k
[2:33:06] SoonerBourne: i mean, i guess i could see tokens if the gear you buy would be "A" tier and loot from the raid would be "S" tier, just as bad luck protection

[2:33:14] mmo_kenna_: that's when the wow token comes in muhahahaha

[2:43:26] Dagomarus: Plus the fact the last 3 bosses were not tested before the mythic players got there
[2:43:55] Destronicus: Do you think Blizz is over compensating things like DBM and Weak Auras and are making all the raids nuts because of them?
[2:44:16] Rottencoarse: @Towelliee  they used the bug to kill it also :D

[2:46:23] S1appadabass: @Towelliee bro our guild cant even get past Heroic Holondrus

[2:46:44] mavericks312: but isnt that most casuals?
[2:46:46] duffluv22: GM from Colorado
[2:47:10] PrimalBF: Exactly, It's still very hard.

[2:54:50] Metket: @Chubfishh do you expect new raid in mid patch? LUL
[2:54:55] Rudric_Ice: blizzard just wants to cater to those 1%'s that mentality needs to change

[2:55:03] theDirtyon3: blood contract

[2:55:09] temp3st98: would you like a progression like eso in wow? @Towelliee
[2:55:10] mmo_kenna_: Those few guilds do give alot of exposure during the RWF but so does Admin when a new raid drops and he tries to clear it
[2:55:10] Chubfishh: nah just some story quests, the aftermath of jailer
[2:55:20] Blvdman: Thats fine
[2:55:24] Korupcija_: good
[2:55:24] nvnto: Why don't they do something like a tournament realm, when the vast majority of mythic raiders never get to see these RFW boss versions anyways?

[2:58:14] Blynx: Funny enough I think an easier 2-3day RWF would be better for blizzard. Less time spent in splits and not actually raiding.
[2:58:15] raldrik: they have to balance how much they support it so they dont get in trouble with youtube
[2:58:18] wigglenobber: world first in wrath was pogchamp

[3:03:18] George2001k: @towelliee you can only kill a boss in mythic with one character per account.
[3:03:36] magemaster225: cross realm should have been open from the start and they should get rid of mythic instanced lockouts
[3:03:41] skrin001: easiest way to stop splits is make everything soul bound to you so that you can not trade it. but that would kill the game.
[3:03:41] stallowned: i think so
[3:03:47] Naturalbeef: No
[3:03:55] Lincoln_WoW: i don't think splits are a big problem tbh
[3:03:56] HaxzorJimDuggan: what if personal loot was not tradeable but was instead unwanted gear became a currency you could use for other gear
[3:04:13] Scoodles91: you dont have the wq for it, it wont count
[3:04:20] mmrghost7: towe , on ur first kill of halond mythic , do u guys clear shield on second set of orbs in phase one and two ?

[3:05:27] Metket: @Towelliee we were discussing with our collecting community about this question: should blizzard give bonus leveling exp at the end of every expension or is it incentivize people to level only when exp ends? do you think blizzard skip bonus exp event this time?
[3:05:41] Lincoln_WoW: i would have preferred to fight the one that hit hard as fuck.
[3:05:56] mmo_kenna_: I see split runs like qualifiers in F1 it's not as exciting to watch but still makes the weekend
[3:06:19] mavericks312: no one wants to fight nerfed bosses
[3:06:37] emznev: KEKW
[3:07:15] Korupcija_: I miss that 100% rep buff we had
[3:07:31] Fenixzzz: @mavericks312 BUT everyone wants to kill the end game boss and see the endgame
[3:07:34] Snabido: Timewalk Legion prepatch invasion, lets go Keepo
[3:07:40] flebbooo: We had that at the end of bfa, like 100% xp bonus

[3:07:54] TheRiwen: I have stop leveling my alts. Just dont like the SL zones

[3:07:58] Rudric_Ice: at the end of the day Jailor is an AI so who gives af
[3:08:01] Metket: i agree but if they give bonus exp EVERY exp, then people quit playing and wait for exp ending, i'm talking about casuals
[3:08:11] emznev: Why is lfr still a thing just have it as normal now?
[3:08:27] blinca: the problem rn is that lfr groups cant go past 90% on jailer

[3:09:30] mmo_kenna_: fine
[3:09:33] Destronicus: Maybe replace LFR with story mode raid, no rewards but just so solo or small group of friends can go in to see the story.
[3:09:38] TheCheeseWheel87: I dont understand the release times of LFR. why do they release each wing 2 weeks after heroic? by this time most people already out gear LFR and just do it for tmog.... LFR must go
[3:09:44] TheRiwen: The people i play with will not come back for season 4

[3:10:27] mmo_kenna_: I'm hyped for season 4, this fated raid thing could pave the way to make raids relevant the whole expansion
[3:10:31] asmodai4823: alot of raiders will take a break in s4

[3:10:46] asmodai4823: why would you care about loot that will last like 4 months
[3:10:53] HaxzorJimDuggan: the legion prepatch was the best, i leveled everything by just afking in the air during the events
[3:10:54] TheRiwen: @mrpresbaby yes they know.
[3:11:07] EmpathyLiveChat: In fact bonus xp at the end of one expac might increase the number of players starting the next expac

[5:14:30] N3llee: small but dedicated community

[5:52:43] eatonaround: was the malgus fight still bugged?
[5:52:44] realdzs: yea the story is very short even with the flashpoint
[5:53:00] N7Spectr3: They are trying something different they had said with this one and want to release the story throughout the year. I didnt care for that approach.
[5:53:06] Asyrr1: yeah there was a lot of hype when it was first coming out but then we got this and everyone was disappointed.

[5:53:57] wEiRdO_dUdE: Yeah, make the chapters beefier
[5:54:10] MorgansBasement: The eternal throne ones were so good, and they were like 2 hours a chapter
[5:54:20] LX2_EXE: oh my bad, yeah 2 hours. That's not an expansion
[5:54:38] MorgansBasement: wasn't it like 18 total?

[5:55:05] LX2_EXE: These game companies are getting lazier and lazier

[5:57:20] 1Beal: But you get more up front
[5:57:36] TheRavenGrave: you also have to remember that this game does not have the support WoW does. So it may take a minute on story lines
[5:57:53] MARTZiiE: got damn the ending credits longer than the content
[5:57:58] Exxcar: Endwalker was a long as some single player RPGS
[5:58:06] Asyrr1: swtor is a dying game unfortunately

[6:22:20] Malarick: cant be this year.  if it was alpha would have happened already no?
[6:22:20] Valentino_R: for now
[6:22:28] cahoots82: did towelliee ever get a response from gfuel?
[6:22:37] beanski10: so if its Dec can we get the talent trees now?

[6:23:01] wEiRdO_dUdE: If they really want it this year, they have to get hot on that beta
[6:23:10] stabzmcgeee: dont they kinda have to now because of the EU laws around preorder stuff?

[6:23:35] Carahail: I just saw it listed...OMG!!
[6:23:38] LoseAlotLuke: no chance
[6:23:40] Exxcar: @Towelliee my biggest concern is that we have no public test at all

[6:24:11] MOLAR305: i was logged in, thank god
[6:24:12] duffluv22: Preorders out????
[6:24:23] HaxzorJimDuggan: alpha needs to start in like 30 minutes if this is actually coming this year LUL
[6:24:23] watpuppy: @Towelliee The difference is that SL has such a small amount of content and such a long period from DF announcement to DF launch that they are ahead of normal timelines assuming they've been working on DF for a long time now

[6:24:47] MistyValkyrie: currently still 188k
[6:24:51] Tzarrus: i think what they will say counts is the pre-patch since it technically changes the state of the game to the new expac, but then the game itself may not release until later
[6:24:54] warrenny: 327
[6:24:55] SphinxyOCE: lmao

[6:26:13] Theduskflyer: its in game to purchase now
[6:26:14] Raadikins: With the lootboxes being removed in OW, do you think someday WoW token will be removed

[6:27:16] ShadowDMG6969: NY Bnet is down for while & that just killed my stream for awhile LMFAO
[6:27:18] HaxzorJimDuggan: some intern was probably suppose to put 2023 on that
[6:27:19] PvtHudson093: It really should have dropped Q1 23
[6:27:19] NieIas: lol reminds me of BFA pre orders when the store had a queue cuz ppl wanted allied races so bad
[6:27:24] klindatu: so on EU for the epic edition you need right now 7 tokens and thats a little more than 2.2 mil
[6:27:35] Birder_L: the system reqs have gone up quite a bit
[6:27:41] Thoreya: SUMMER 2023 COPIUM

[6:27:52] Flyer_753: I can't see how they would've had the time to make something good so fast with everything that's been going on at Blizzard
[6:27:53] ijuki: Wait, season 4 won't last that long will it?

[6:28:11] MrGharr: why would you need more than 2 months?
[6:28:13] duffluv22: COD October 28!!!!
[6:28:17] azzurrin: They must have started developing DF like in 2021 9.1
[6:28:27] Svendv: @Exxcar i hope so
[6:28:34] Rexialiton: @duffluv22 no way dude! really
[6:28:38] icerasta: They ahve said from the beginning season 4 was going to be significantly shorter than season 3
[6:28:39] warrenny: @duffluv22 Mw# version 2?
[6:28:39] empanadaconpapasfritas: They announced release date?
[6:28:45] zgag: I can't see Blizzard releasing D4 and Dragonflight around the same time.  There will be a buffer somewhere
[6:28:50] duffluv22: Yes
[6:29:01] ijuki: @zgag D4 is next year most likely
[6:29:04] Zivs: @zgag d4 will be 2023

[6:29:08] empanadaconpapasfritas: On or before December 31, 2022, @Towelliee

[6:29:22] mavericks312: I don't see DF releasing this year tbh
[6:29:27] LX2_EXE: Diablo 4 is 2023
[6:29:34] ShadowDMG6969: DIablo4 is definitely a May release

[6:29:56] icerasta: They also said in the reveal that they have been working on DF for longer than any other expansion before the reveal
[6:29:58] Asyrr1: df trying to compete with wotlk xd
[6:29:59] JimKappa420: your bnet is stuck on connecting
[6:30:02] ZaneNdat12345: December 31st it says
[6:30:03] Exxcar: If they say its 2022 at pre-order time and don't deliver, then they HAVE to provide refunds

[6:30:41] ArrtyyTV: big babies
[6:30:42] sellblade: @warrenny Unless they are planning to only test very specific things. Only thing they said they want specific feedback on was the Talent Trees. They can encrypt story stuff, they may feel confident with going for a barely beta tested raid after Sepulcher last bosses.
[6:30:42] Tigerklaue: you can always refund even if its 2022
[6:30:43] raldrik: heathstone is having issues. Its the authentication servers which is why you cannot login through the game directly either

[6:36:23] Birder_L: @Kashku if you are uk amazon is very reliable
[6:36:24] wEiRdO_dUdE: In theory, Blizzard could get it out the door this year, but it seems like it would take people working overtime
[6:36:25] DeanoTV: i think itll be november release

[6:37:01] ILikeKillTheZombies: I think collectors edition might have a dragon furry suit or pajama

[6:37:58] dutchie76: not surprised the new expac is coming out this year
[6:38:00] Siven80: i mean, if they dont have many/any systems to test and balance i guess a quick release makes sense
[6:38:01] Rexialiton: @raldrik no way. really
[6:38:01] ShadowDMG6969: Authentication Serers being Down mean no one is getting on Blizzard games
[6:38:13] Kashku: @Birder_L I'm EU but I think it's the same here, didn't think of that, thanks!

[6:43:21] Herzenliegen: How can i give them my money if bnet is down? :(
[6:43:23] rams_sharpe: sounds like they put the price inline with the $70 base of other AAA games
[6:43:23] Effin_Steffin: Inflation bros.
[6:43:30] dutchie76: lol
[6:43:37] Flyer_753: I want to play WoW, but I also don't want to support Blizzard. Unfortunate
[6:43:37] NixxyAI: They are gambling with players trust ; not that they got any left :) so not many will pre-order
[6:43:38] creamdrood: Irramaan subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 119 months! 
[6:43:44] Armdel: thats standard isnt it
[6:43:54] Armdel: preorder before beta i mean

[6:45:01] tkzod: Inflation
[6:45:03] Short_Film: Inflation :(
[6:45:03] HaxzorJimDuggan: $10 more to get it out this year Kappa
[6:45:04] Zeke_nl: the sky is falling
[6:45:04] rams_sharpe: that's in line with the new $70 game p rice
[6:45:07] Svendv: yeah its inflation
[6:45:08] Reckless_Monk: Epic Edition went up 10 bucks T_T

[6:45:14] notemneiher: @artiiz yeah but only care for mount
[6:45:14] 1Beal: If it has infinite supply, you should never pre order anything
[6:45:16] skrin001: Thats life everyone else is doing it why not them.
[6:45:16] CodeEmergency: just look you can get the complete collection now on the store for $109
[6:45:19] Artiiz: @dumax26 ooh
[6:45:20] Armdel: pretty much all new games are $10 more now
[6:45:20] sillymanfish: Alpha today?
[6:45:21] CanadianCataclysm: Base version is still the same price.
[6:45:21] bigslick117: ya we gotta pay for them court bills
[6:45:21] KinggKebab: Wows homepage also now says DF in 2022
[6:45:22] moa285: WoW Token on EU - Sold Out KEKW
[6:45:22] Kinghorn: yeah economic for them, line their coffers
[6:45:23] 1Beal: Doesn't matter what it is
[6:45:25] wEiRdO_dUdE: Going from $39.99 to $49.99 is about a 25% increase in price....that's chunky
[6:45:26] TheMapleKitKat: Its like did they not make enough from Diablo immortal like............
[6:45:26] RayenDark: Sub + more mog + boost I think?
[6:45:26] Effin_Steffin: I cant even preorder yet because BNET is still down anyway. They dont want my WoW Token money
[6:45:27] mandilozano: better be more than 3 patches @Towelliee
[6:45:28] warrenny: Inflation
[6:45:30] Sikksakk: inflation
[6:45:31] Tigerklaue: 50+sub is alot
[6:45:31] cineris_3: could be worse, haven't increased sub fees at least
[6:45:33] NixxyAI: @Towelliee people will wait for seeing it if its good at streamers that pre-roder if not they will bounce back to other mmo like FF 14... im 99% sure... blizz better relaese it good or they gonna get more community lost
[6:45:33] Janigiv: Sadge
[6:45:35] CanadianCataclysm: Its only Heroic and Epic version that got the increase
[6:45:36] luravi: it was evil corporate Microsoft thing aimirite
[6:45:37] c0mmander_starscream: Inflation on a digital item
[6:45:43] Rexialiton: Inflation? Sorry for being a bit stupid. But what does that mean?
[6:45:44] Reckless_Monk: 5 more months.. LUL
[6:45:46] TheRavenGrave: you can sign up for the beta at least
[6:45:48] Artiiz: @dumax26 so its kind of worth it still if you're actively playing the game rn with the sub
[6:45:48] warrenny: @mandilozano 3 is standard
[6:45:53] Zeke_nl: i have a feeling this date is tentative, as in could very well change
[6:45:54] Moobot: Check out Towelliee's YouTube channel! You can view the most recent uploaded video HERE || The BIG ISSUE With coming back to SWTOR! youtu.be/jXFS8VY0QJM
[6:45:55] CullenPrime: I haven't played WoW in about a year and even I am going to buy the expansion
[6:45:59] Rottencoarse: @Towelliee  i did not receive the wings yet :D
[6:46:05] raldrik: Atleast the price difference between Heroic and Epic is the same. To me that signals no sub price increase planned with the increased game price.
[6:46:07] bigslick117: @Towelliee 10 dollar price increase to help pay for those court costs
[6:46:12] wEiRdO_dUdE: Ideally we want Dragonflight this year, but can it be polished and working well
[6:46:14] sillymanfish: Make alpha today or next week
[6:46:14] Alegnowar: whit ow2 coming in october i was alomost sure wow exp wouldn't come out this year
[6:46:17] redfernn: World of Warcraft¬Æ: Dragonflight will be available on or before December 31, 2022.
[6:46:29] Birder_L: Lil ursoc <3
[6:46:30] dumax26: @Artiiz if you like the cosmetics why not
[6:46:31] xhale2nhale: I just see that date as a default date on pre-order and the real date will be next year
[6:46:32] BrainGushersTV: I just wanted to play the game damn pre-order ruining it for me FeelsBadMan
[6:46:34] gnomesarethebest: will u play a gnome for me , fine sir
[6:46:35] blossomcamm: and it will come out everyone will hate it LUL and complain
[6:46:35] Herzenliegen: I'm okay if it's not this year. I would rather them take their time and release a good expansion.
[6:46:38] the_general01: i mean the upside is the mount, a month free, and the boost
[6:46:39] abracka_: flavor of the month
[6:46:39] N3llee: fear of missing out
[6:46:40] brewgamingtv: make's me worry cuz we haven't even seen any of the other tree's or got to test them

[6:46:44] PvtHudson093: fear  of missing out
[6:46:45] Kinghorn: fear of missing out
[6:46:46] board4life65: fear of missing out
[6:46:46] odysseus1: <1 minute wait, 30 minutes later
[6:46:50] DeanoTV: whats ur guess for release date? @Towelliee
[6:46:52] WhiteU: @Towelliee actually is even worse base and heroic is now plus 12 euro so you can play, if you dont have a sub, so its 62 euro base, 82 euro heroic man, its so stupid expensive wtf man
[6:46:54] c0mmander_starscream: If they Blizz did increase the monthly sub costs, the forums will go nuclear
[6:47:04] I__Am__Cam: Whens the release date?
[6:47:05] Gingerprimer: PPL are voting with ther wallet by buying it
[6:47:05] xhale2nhale: I voted with mines which was 89.99, I saw mog
[6:47:06] abracka_: oh wow i am a boomer and had the wrong idea what it meant lmao
[6:47:07] bigslick117: pre orders determine how hard they work
[6:47:13] NixxyAI: @Towelliee i disagree remember what happened in CATA when they destroyed healer class?? they lost over 70% of community not just peeps :)
[6:47:18] Garrek__: I thought that the epic version of sl was 100 bucks
[6:47:24] Oswanov: Ima see how beta is. If it isnt absolute shit, ima get it since I'm guaranteed to get a decent chunk of fun out of it initially
[6:47:26] ILikeKillTheZombies: i will have to wait for a discount to play DF :D
[6:47:29] NixxyAI: It can get worse and it might ^_^
[6:47:29] 1Beal: I didn't pre order shadowlands and watched the beta videos and it was the first WoW Xpac I didn't play. DON'T PREORDER
[6:47:35] NieIas: epic edition gang
[6:47:35] ILikeKillTheZombies: i was always buying on launch
[6:47:36] warrenny: ¬£5 more for epic
[6:47:40] byrdeen45: ill buy it why not it looks fun
[6:47:40] OGXanos: gotta get those Q2 numbers up
[6:47:40] blascotwitch: im tough im preordering it tomorrow
[6:47:42] 1Beal: Wait to see if it's jank
[6:47:45] ArroArroArro: getting this big money grab before Q2 numbers come out! only reason they do it now... pathatic (I still bought it)

[6:48:09] wazon_7: haha, 90EURO for epic, good jokes
[6:48:13] xhale2nhale: I played for game for 15yrs ain't gonna pretend i'm not gonna buy it, I find a way to get my fun out the game
[6:48:13] NixxyAI: That is because its rushed product... has good 5-10hours rest is CRAP :)
[6:48:13] Thoreya: @1Beal @1Beal stop tellin people what to do LUL LUL
[6:48:14] Rudric_Ice: i bought the heroic version will upgrade it to epic later when its on discount
[6:48:17] 1Beal: @deanotv If you're gonna play it regardless, then go for it
[6:48:17] dranet11: I'm -¬£75
[6:48:20] lupecci11: can you get it using wow tokens?
[6:48:21] ijuki: @wazon_7 POGGERS
[6:48:21] NixxyAI: THAT is why you NEVER rush...
[6:48:24] smorisha: why wait for bnet when you can login with your email and pass
[6:48:25] leothefaulkner: Thinking about what class to use my boost on.  What class do you think will be most fun in DF?
[6:48:25] bc_23_: getting epic on friday!!
[6:48:29] 1Beal: Just saying that for people on the fence
[6:48:31] PlaguedV: and im just gonna watch towel play it like i did for everything after legion KEKWlaugh
[6:48:33] TheMapleKitKat: yea its wackkkkk
[6:48:35] NixxyAI: and its even a Sub....
[6:48:37] Sikksakk: will there be a physical collectors edition?
[6:48:38] rams_sharpe: it's cause the new $70 base price of AAA games
[6:48:39] Coloredtoad: It's a Dragon Tax
[6:48:41] flebbooo: yeah thats rough tbh...
[6:48:49] blossomcamm: thats inflation for ya
[6:48:51] SindrinX2: Do you think there will be a physical collectors?
[6:48:53] OceanManCarter: Might be a hot take but I'd rather have a box price increase than a sub price increase
[6:48:53] LX2_EXE: Not cool increasing the price without an excuse
[6:48:53] Alegnowar: 50$ base exp is pretty high, almost a full game
[6:48:55] Thoreya: omg the copium is real
[6:48:56] vansenthelock: 2022 is the inflation year that is for sure
[6:49:00] BE3njo: Y nobody likes it lets be real here, its sucks ass, and im sure they will have plenty of excuses for it
[6:49:02] OGXanos: how much has the wow team increased in size since SL launch?
[6:49:06] Zendero89: they have to put a date to even sell it right?
[6:49:06] trivotix: people do not understand the word estimated
[6:49:07] Artiiz: yeah its just a placeholder, people mix that up quite easily
[6:49:07] Kinghorn: I stopped buying the virtual blizzcons because of the price increase
[6:49:09] dranet11: didn't shadowlands get pushed past their first release date too? @Towelliee
[6:49:12] CanadianCataclysm: They are just trying to set a date for the investors for this year
[6:49:13] watpuppy: @Towelliee I think people just need to understand that there are never new games nowadays that are perfect at launch.  I can't think of a single videogame anymore that is  perfect at launch.  Games are bigger, better, and more complex than ever so expecting them to be polished at launch isn't reasonable.
[6:49:16] Thoreya: same people that were determined that SL was gonna launch in 2021 LUL LUL LUL
[6:49:20] redfernn: World of Warcraft¬Æ: Dragonflight will be available on or before December 31, 2022.     that is probably for Beta
[6:49:22] xhale2nhale: yea I think it's just a default place holder date
[6:49:23] Thoreya: copium is real man
[6:49:27] moa285: "*World of Warcraft¬Æ: Dragonflight will be available on or before December 31, 2022."
[6:49:31] sh1asurprise: @Towelliee In the EU they have to provide a release date if they accept money. If the date moves for any reason EU has laws in place that allows for refunds
[6:49:35] Krue_Sr: Aren't there legal reasons why they have to have it there?
[6:49:39] duffluv22: Need to change the wording then maybe??
[6:49:42] Artiiz: I hope they take their time with it, then again we don't know how much resources has been put into the new xpac instead of this current one
[6:49:44] xdyabolical: i love this game, I hope.... this does not feel rushed
[6:49:45] vansenthelock: vansenthelock subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 21 months! Lets hope for alpha/beta soon!
[6:49:49] Metket: i can't believe my eyes. @Towelliee
[6:49:50] sillymanfish: It‚Äôs just them trying to generate hype and get people playing @towelliee
[6:49:52] NixxyAI: @Towelliee but no games release pre-order at least -1 year behind... thats just COPIUM hard for extra $$$ .... BLizz is trying to get away with hard cash before Next year... Next year Microsoft takes over..
[6:49:52] jasperboy: Its a typo, its supposed to say "on or before december 31st 2023"
[6:49:52] CodeEmergency: I think blizzard are waiting to see what AoC and Throne and Liberty are doing on whether they will push it out this year or not.
[6:49:52] Exxcar: And that's where Blizzard got in trouble with EU Refund Laws
[6:49:54] KinggKebab: Wow homepage says 2022, doesn‚Äôt say which month.
[6:49:56] CullenPrime: Yeah but other expansions have said by Dec 31 blah blah and they were released on or before then
[6:49:58] Bwyllin_: I jump mmos too much to justify preordering it until a month or so before
[6:50:06] dutchie76: well remember too there arent many "systems" in dragonflight
[6:50:07] CanadianCataclysm: Did shadowlands not have a reelase date then they pushed it back a few weeks?
[6:50:11] Thoreya: the denial is so strong holy
[6:50:13] lithium364: theyre flat insane
[6:50:14] moa285: We'll see COPIUM Kappa
[6:50:17] CoupDavil: @Towelliee Any guesses to when WOLK Classic beta drops?
[6:50:19] wEiRdO_dUdE: There is an asterisk at the start of the sentence for Dec 31st
[6:50:19] 1Beal: Also pre-ordering incentivizes the devs to make a worse product because less work, since they have your money already
[6:50:20] Svendv: @NixxyAI not really, in EU with regelations they need to refund if it doesnt come out this year
[6:50:21] Artiiz: @CodeEmergency AoC will not be out for many years imo
[6:50:21] HaloS23: do they give systme reqs yet?
[6:50:21] lithium364: trying to bring it out this year
[6:50:22] szeeman62: @towelliee they have to have a date to accept pre orders or the EU and Australia can force refunds
[6:50:24] bigslick117: member berries
[6:50:24] Keyastaron_: pog it was TRUE
[6:50:25] fumii_tv: it let me log in
[6:50:25] NixxyAI: @Towelliee its pretty  grim toweliee... because next year i think in january microsoft takes over activision blizzard.. so why they rush products now????? Its kinda very clear..
[6:50:27] K_A_N_J_I: Collectors edition 130$ @towelliee
[6:50:28] fumii_tv: no cap

[6:50:33] iamspacemanspiff: the same people complaining now saying it wont be polished will be the same people complaining if its not released on 12/31/2022
[6:50:39] Tigerklaue: @dutchie76 every class will have a new talent tree which is alot of testing balancing
[6:50:45] Rudric_Ice: $50 for base game should've come with a month of game time
[6:50:50] Reckless_Monk: They say that then, they go and push back
[6:50:55] CodeEmergency: @Artiiz true, but if talk heats up it could push blizzard into a cash grab to make money now kinda deal.
[6:50:57] NieIas: LUL
[6:50:57] dutchie76: LUL
[6:50:59] moa285: I don't think they can afford another postponement.  ConcernDoge

[6:51:10] Alegnowar: i too feel like activision is going full out releasing a lot of shit before the microsoft aquisition for the highest payout they can get
[6:51:10] bc_23_: I'm buying DragonFlight with the mentality that when it comes out I have it. Not basing my purchase on a specific date.
