[1:33:46] strike879: @towelliee are those sygils and powder the same as sandworn relics? then they could just make them account bound from the start unless ofc ppl with an army of alts insta get pre raid bis
[1:33:55] TacDuc: If something is worth it I will do it, even on multiple characters, but if it's not worth it, or just not fun then I will probably do it too, but not as much

[1:42:50] Farfic: world first
[1:42:50] Lazugo: @Skizzurp it doesnt matter for raid testing. your character get scaled
[1:43:19] Skizzurp: right but they have to be max level tho
[1:43:22] Lazugo: what i want to see is starting to see the tier set effects
[1:43:37] bwoods79: I did 2-3 TW dungeons for TBC, kind of fun
[1:44:13] Lazugo: yeah like they need to start releaseing the tier set effects
[1:44:20] Lazugo: this is gonna be a shit show
[1:44:29] CanadianCataclysm: Maybe there be no raid testing and everyone goes in blind
[1:44:43] thiccsushi: There's a lot and prepatch is leaked to be at the end of next month LUL
[1:44:56] bwoods79: I did like how on beta it seems like there isn't mob tagging between factions for quest mobs at least
[1:44:56] Skizzurp: raid testing is 2 weeks m+ is like a week
[1:45:44] smol_gunner: what is there to test apart from Raidtesting? even that is w/e
[1:45:46] CritcobainTV: yeah think so
[1:46:16] Lazugo: now real talk they need to relocate some of that glyphs
[1:46:21] Skizzurp: i didnt test sepulcher but sanctum was 3 bosses a day
[1:46:23] Vetyst: Didnt they say they wanted to get rid of raidtesting in general tho?
[1:46:43] Lazugo: @Skizzurp sanctum was 10 this time is only 8

[1:48:49] Lazugo: Ok got all the dragon glyphs
[1:48:58] Heyhowsitgoingtonight: gy
[1:49:02] bagrain: you can tank lib already yeah
[1:49:08] smol_gunner: @thiccsushi idk man, seems to me a very small part of the raiding community seems to believe that raidtesting actually matter for blizzard
[1:50:06] Skizzurp: and if we break any of the boss mechanics
[1:50:14] Lazugo: Like for them to start testing the raid they need to start releasing the tier effects

[1:52:52] thiccsushi: I think they will over correct next tier and it'll be short too
[1:52:53] Skizzurp: well depends on if they release all difficulties same week
[1:53:10] Skizzurp: if they dont have the normal/heroic gear up week then it could go into week 2
[1:53:13] Lazugo: well, liquid will they already teased the location
[1:53:14] smol_gunner: Emerald Nightmare 2.0 inc?
[1:53:19] Alienfromger: if its too short ppl will complain :)

[1:56:34] Skizzurp: the biggest rwf curveball that will effect its duration is whether or not they really release mythic at same time as normal heroic

[1:57:22] L4nds1ide: is DF 100% out this year
[1:57:35] Aervyper: all difficulties the same week? doesn't that make even more to do for raiding groups?
[1:57:42] thiccsushi: @L4ndslide Most likely since they have said so

[1:58:02] BoezIRL: @BoezIRL towDance VoHiYo towDance VoHiYo towLove
[1:58:31] jasonbriggs: if they do open all raid difficulties at same time the top raiding guilds prob wont even do normal only heroic and mythic
[1:58:31] Dagomarus: @aervyper the rwf teams will still do heroic splits its just they will feel more pressure to do mythic
[2:00:09] BoezIRL: wished they at least changed the level spell towCry
[2:00:12] Romulus211: Yes it is, theres also the test of faith in Thousand Needles.
[2:00:31] mavericks312: ppl are undervaluing the tier sets lol
[2:00:33] Skizzurp: yea if all tiers same time its harder for them to have gear to be carrying heroic bosses week 1
[2:00:54] Skizzurp: you wont be able to bring in people from community to hopefully get their gear
[2:00:58] StreamElements: Use code POGTOWEL120 for $120 off at https://strms.net/TowellieeFactorMarBot #ad

[2:02:15] Moobot: I will be leveling a toon on the NA Fresh Server Maladath (Normal) 8/30 when servers go up. Not doing anything special guild wise just leveling to get a Paladin and DK ready for WOTLK Launch
[2:02:30] kimmo_gaming: a fart? LOL
[2:02:47] Akoudadis: Draenor classic when? @Towelliee
[2:03:02] strike879: it all depends on how easy the tier upgrade item is to get if its somewhat easy then they might just skip normall idd
[2:03:08] dman59847: I'd be going to dustwallow marsh
[2:03:15] jasonbriggs: i think you will be able to trade gear even if its better than what you have on not like in previous raid tiers
[2:04:18] Skizzurp: if u enable group loot
[2:04:33] NBK_Sethus: they need to piss off with forced personal loot

[2:47:41] BobLongMVP: I wonder if the void lords used to be benevolent and got hijacked
[2:47:45] Jokervenom1978: Void Lords have too many tentacles to be good.
[2:48:00] Molvonos: Better Take: All of the elements are equally shitty and constantly warring against each other and the prime material plane, where Azeroth is, is the warzone.  Some elements display themselves 'better' (i.e. Light, Nature) than others (Death, Void).

[2:52:43] Molvonos: @91Niki Naaru Method: "Hey Illidan, does this smell like chloroform?"
[2:52:47] theDirtyon3: Elune is too young for that
[2:52:56] MILESkg21: Molvonos OMEGALUL

[2:53:34] xotankkk: turallion is a light simp
[2:53:35] scumlucki: @EpicMonkeyFailzGaming i played through shadowlands and all i got from who elune is that she's the nigh elfs space god or something
[2:53:36] PanoramicPanda: I mean, didn't they imply that Elune is just one of the head honcho's in  the Realm of Life, just as the Winter Queen is in the Realm of Death?

[2:57:09] scumlucki: Gonna start a guildof naaru worshippers
[2:57:13] TombStoneMercenary: No kink shaming....

[3:00:14] ocdgamernerd: Wait, why cant he get laid?
[3:00:17] TacDuc: @KingSpud91 Ilgynoth does mention some things, like the King of Diamonds has been made a pawn, which refer to a book called king of diamonds.  Which is a book about a boy that becomes king. And Anduin became a pawn
[3:00:22] lalelusa: and he's like what, 23 years old at this point?
[3:00:27] szble: both worthless
[3:00:27] Alepouditsa: good no one want him

[3:01:59] warrenny: Looking for peace is a good thing
[3:02:08] Tiamarilien: He's a healer, not a fighter... or was
[3:02:10] CommanderKrano: time to split the soul of the boy in half and send one half to be a gladiator!
[3:02:11] scumlucki: let anduin retire have a family then destroy his family infront of him and let the story run its course
[3:02:21] TacDuc: His dad also has the spirit of the wolf wild god in him...
[3:02:22] Ezekyler: Marco Aurelio
[3:02:23] abracka_: he's kind of pulling a varian now though isn't he? with disappearing to "find himself" and vacating the thrown, similar to what varian did
[3:02:24] 91Niki: @gaba_receptor_respector The difference is, Towelliee cares about his mental and physical health and doesn't binge level for 5 days straight LUL
[3:02:26] wEiRdO_dUdE: @Meliea_EU gratz, if it says Beta is available in your launcher, you got an invite
[3:02:30] arturiuss44: Marcus Arelius
[3:02:30] warbringer159: varian was the best thing to happen to the alliance
[3:02:31] Clicklesly: Obvious solution is to force Anduin to become a pit fighter for a few years
[3:02:37] RagingPunk: sorry son but your a pussy
[3:02:39] ocdgamernerd: I never get Beta till right before it ends.  lol
[3:02:49] TombStoneMercenary: Varian was kindnapped and split in two
[3:02:52] StrawhatOwen: Varian was captured and slaved as a gladiator
[3:02:53] abracka_: i'm not sure, not the greatest memory with the lore
[3:02:55] AvrithSATX: Varian was kidnapped and split into two people b/c of a spell. Not the same.
[3:02:56] 91Niki: @gaba_receptor_respector And he's been playing other things besides wrath pre patch
[3:02:57] Tiamarilien: no amnesia is a b
[3:02:59] scumlucki: Need a new lich king
[3:03:23] TacDuc: So Ilgynoth says "From the earth, he draws strength. Our earth. Our strength." Which could refer to either Wrathion or that other black dragon, and considering that Wrathion was experimented on to release him from Old God Corruption
[3:03:23] Moobot: Towelliee will be playing WOTLK Classic on the Fresh server Maladath.
[3:03:31] Dadghar: Now we know why Malfurion stayed asleep all that time...one look at the waifu and -holy shit- >>;

[3:03:38] 210Crawler: We need uthred
[3:03:41] Alienfromger: anduin could learn leadership from sylvanas
[3:03:52] scumlucki: the amount of anima arthas turned into isnt even enough to buy me a ring for pvp
[3:04:03] wEiRdO_dUdE: I still haven't gotten any beta invites....but I have plenty to work on with Wrath prep, so I'm not bored
[3:04:26] ShadoodHD: if shadowlands is only about getting anduin out of the game for a bit i'd lmao
[3:04:36] AvrithSATX: @Alienfromger What? How to betray everyone and everything she ever believed or stood for all for a childish quest to make existence "fair"?

[3:21:20] wEiRdO_dUdE: Yeah, seal of command does AoE damage now
[3:21:40] goosejamss: not like fully but it's painful and makes a popping sound
[3:21:47] ArcaneSyntax: I remember the command memes back in wrath and I didn't like it back then. felt like it wasn't worth for how easy dungeons are
[3:22:56] jberry: @towelliee I just had my labrum repaired and my bicep screwed into the bone of my arm dude
[3:23:06] jberry: The sling life isn’t fun trust
[3:23:11] jberry: Going insane
[3:23:12] Tiamarilien: no, just popping like cracking you knuckles. My shoulders pop too, nearly every time I move them. If I need to pop them and haven't yet, they're sore and have less range of movement
[3:23:36] 91Niki: I can't exercise for 4 weeks after my surgery, cuz it can result in nose bleed you can't stop. I can already tell not exercising for 4 weeks is gonna drive me nuts LUL

[3:25:21] jberry: Shoot
[3:25:29] propwash80: @Towelliee would  you recommend using a boost for wrath classic?
[3:25:55] Ertra: they shoot a radioactive dye into your shoulder so they can see the tears

[3:26:27] Jokervenom1978: Maybe Towelliee will get super powers from it.
[3:26:30] reallyhairygamer: jesus thats not for MRI .. thats for a CT scan
[3:26:33] Ertra: no, you don't drink it... it's injected
[3:26:33] kay0234: Depends on where you get it...like if you get contrast through iv it doesnt hurt but it makes you feel like your peeing yourself
[3:26:34] Imtheguy15: yea i had mri done on my chest with dye lets them see shit easier also said the die makes you feel like you pissed yourself that was weird
[3:26:38] rick_morks: drinking radioactive stuf is my favorite

[3:53:30] mavericks312: and viewers from the streamer who hosted would type and get mad they werent being answered
[3:53:47] kimmo_gaming: Well isnt that a point, you will not host anyone when you are online, but when you go off its logical that a person gets trasnferred to their chat

[4:05:27] Kinghorn: classic is huge in china too
[4:05:29] c0mmander_starscream: China FortOne
[4:05:30] LearnedSomething: if I lived in china I'd have some chinese children
[4:05:39] devoted_bee: @Hybridwarhawk +5000 credits
[4:05:40] mavericks312: @Goof3y blizzard cares look how much money they make them
[4:05:48] PhillyDilly18: Do you think there would ever be a day where China was like "okay this is enough"?

[4:06:02] Kinghorn: PrideShrug
[4:06:05] nyberrite: doesnt classic have more active raiders ?
[4:06:10] Broomba: next @towelliee project -- level a wow toon in china retail and classic
[4:06:13] Goof3y: Yeah but if the game dies in NA and EU it really doesn't matter to us if china keeps playing it.
[4:06:35] ArcaneSyntax: the only data people have that supports that classic has more players is number of logs, which I don't think represents total players.
[4:06:36] Snabido: Welcome to cycle of WoW 😏

[4:06:49] LearnedSomething: you make it sound romantic
[4:06:49] c0mmander_starscream: Thanks Ion
[4:06:54] Tacohealer: Anyone start getting audio popping after the patch and know how to fix it?
[4:06:54] oct_r: I don't spend much time watching streams, just drop in on occasion. I enjoyed shadowlands, but the content drout and broken class balancing that didnt get addressed. Played a lot of shadowlands, the most since legion... Whats your take on DF? will be better than SL? better than legion?
[4:06:56] Mecabeast: servers depopulate and then get combined because people left small servers for big ones
[4:06:57] smashwow: you mean classic is going to be classic?
[4:07:01] xrandomdoodx: at least ulduar still gonna bang  Kreygasm
[4:07:02] oct_r: Honestly curious, I just lost hope with SL
[4:07:06] CommanderKrano: never even did one GDKP while playing classic. So, i cant relate :D
[4:07:06] oct_r: and how blizzard didnt support it
[4:07:08] oct_r: cash grab
[4:07:08] rymerre: im only playing wrath due to bordem...once DF comes out classic is dead to me
[4:07:09] wEiRdO_dUdE: Dungeon finder is going to be a problem, long term
[4:07:18] Hybridwarhawk: If I can do each raid once, I"ll be content.
[4:07:29] nyberrite: @Towelliee I think classic is way more popular than you think
[4:07:35] tyler2tall89: blizz doesnt care, i've had a ticket open for 9 days with no answer. Paying sub for a game i cant play rn.
[4:07:41] healmore49: kinda a weird take lol
[4:07:44] TheUnknowing: I love wrath and ill play it but im not going to prioritize it over retail at all.
[4:07:48] ArcaneSyntax: and the private server people fuckin ruin it every time.
[4:07:49] LearnedSomething: those are the real void lords
[4:07:50] LordKain73: People actually think that Wrath classic is going to have higher numbers than DF?  Buaaaaahahahaha! towStop towIt
[4:07:56] mavericks312: @nyberrite but candies dont realize wrath is basically retail
[4:07:57] Moobot: KeidooTV, Just for the time being we will be automatically removing any "Pay to Win" comments regardless of context to clean up chat while we play Lost Ark. Sorry for the inconvenience!
[4:08:01] TheEndIsNear777: People can "union" ize and stop going to gdkp's but they won't stop as long as they can buy gold for cheap and bots don't get banned because they provide metrics for quaterly earnings
[4:08:09] ChimpanQ: Idk, if we look at Shadowlands, it dropped off pretty hard at the start
[4:08:13] oct_r: Whats your take on DF? I know you been playing a lot
[4:08:24] oct_r: Blizzard will support it? unlike SL
[4:08:30] nyberrite: @Towelliee did you see the Bellular video on this subject? active raiders in classic vs retail ?
[4:08:37] wEiRdO_dUdE: GDKP is content, yeah
[4:08:38] hikaritd: People played all Classic "expacs", the vibe is just not the same, the experience isnt the same as first time, thats why classics drop hard
[4:08:44] Snabido: @oct_r ResidentSleeper
[4:08:50] Kinghorn: I wish they would but alas
[4:08:50] mavericks312: @ChimpanQ SL is kind of an outlier in the sense that no other xpac had to deal with a global pandemic which halted content output
[4:09:05] KeidooTV: yh but people buy gold to do those runs lol  thats the thing
[4:09:05] TheEndIsNear777: with no gdkp there is just raids
[4:09:08] wEiRdO_dUdE: "Emergent player behavior" that some people love doing
[4:09:09] Asmongoat: very wise lol
[4:09:11] TheEndIsNear777: free gear >:)
[4:09:14] oct_r: We have a guild of about 30 friends that came back to WoW for wotlk classic, going to raid, but a lot of us came back for arena
[4:09:16] mavericks312: this man said bellular lol
[4:09:22] oct_r: all of us in our 30s
[4:09:25] LordKain73: Wrath was my top expansion...still have no desire to replay it.
[4:09:31] Broomba: bellular KEKW
[4:09:33] Havoc_S1: He’s to toxic
[4:09:35] Mecabeast: I laughed about the outcry from everyone getting banned in AV
[4:09:43] neugassh: retail has worse player retention than classic
[4:09:51] MILESkg21: the AV BANS KEKW
[4:09:58] ChimpanQ: just play what you like ^^
[4:09:59] KeidooTV: @neugassh true

[4:10:02] oct_r: I hope DF is good man, ill def be hype and my friends will come...
[4:10:07] oct_r: I just lost hope with SL
[4:10:13] nyberrite: I think its great - some weeks I am in a retail mood, some weeks its classic - can play whatever
[4:10:17] BlackCl0ud: i'm just playing wow because i couldn't afford when i was a kid and i love it
[4:10:18] CertifiableAndy: It was smart to include classic stuff into the 6 month sub
[4:10:24] Hybridwarhawk: dolla dolla bills ya'll
[4:10:37] Broomba: never understood or cared for this meta crap
[4:10:48] Asmongoat: i just hope DF has enough fun and engaging endgame stuff
[4:11:05] MILESkg21: Endgame = Crafting
[4:11:13] Mordekaized: PixelBob
[4:11:19] mavericks312: SL would have been a great xpac if the content patches werent delayed due to the pandemic
[4:11:27] neverbornlucky: he's actually wrath classic questing OMG
[4:11:30] PinksChicken: The new crafting system looks pre dope tbh

[4:12:08] Kinghorn: wait they said that? KEKWDISCO
[4:12:10] oct_r: SL was good and had so much potential
[4:12:24] abracka_: that shit was hilarious with them saying it's a trilogy
[4:12:27] MILESkg21: SL was WOD 2.0 KEKW
[4:12:28] Kinghorn: it was so obvious sofo was mashed together
[4:12:44] neugassh: great LUL
[4:12:48] Asmongoat: SL wod 2.0, so lets hope DF is legion 2.0
[4:12:53] ArcaneSyntax: I actually think since 9.2 it's been the best retail has been in a long time.
[4:12:56] TheEndIsNear777: SL pvp = die in stun
[4:12:56] mavericks312: @Kinghorn yea sofo felt like 2 raids with anduin being the last boss of the first
[4:12:57] Snabido: @MilesKG21 Dead side of WoD, and WoD was already dead
[4:13:15] Jokervenom1978: What pissed me off at the beginning was the "Let loot be loot" mentality.
[4:13:16] oct_r: Legion, mythic ToS was my favorite content in modern retail
[4:13:23] Asmongoat: YoU caN WAlK on WaTer
[4:13:26] Alepouditsa: and yet i loved BFA more then SL
[4:13:29] Thoreya: sl m+ was pretty fun, specially s4. 9.1 was the worst thing ive ever played tho
[4:13:38] mavericks312: @Jokervenom1978 you mean the classic mentality lol
[4:13:45] CommanderKrano: water like you never seen before! PogChamp
[4:13:46] smashwow: never seen water like this
[4:13:52] neverbornlucky: at least when blizzard does stuff they know what their team leads name and job title are during press deals
[4:14:04] smashwow: tf you mean. go outside look around
[4:14:06] confl1ct10n: I wish they would introduce new raids and dungeons like OS and TOC.
[4:14:08] Thoreya: nah SL was fun af the first 2 months
[4:14:08] Mecabeast: this will be the first time I'll hit a decent ilvl without mythic raiding will be around  299 this week
[4:14:22] smashwow: season 4 is kinda meh
[4:14:34] LearnedSomething: not a lot a lot but sure, for many players
[4:14:39] mavericks312: and you cant name to many raids that are better then CN
[4:14:44] confl1ct10n: I wish they would introduce new raids and dungeons like OS and TOC.
[4:15:00] smashwow: dinar should make it into DF
[4:15:14] Kinghorn: I just wish it was more than weapons and trinkets with dinar
[4:15:34] neverbornlucky: Towelliee what will be the wow expansion in 2040 >???\
[4:15:52] wEiRdO_dUdE: Yeah, dinar is more of a catch-up even though deterministic gear is better for players
[4:15:53] Recknry: good catchup mechanic, not boost through content mechanic
[4:15:57] Snabido: Make it a RNG box you buy instead, that will satisfy people Keepo
[4:15:59] oct_r: LOL
[4:16:00] Contendedlemon: will there be a "creation catalyst" in DF?
[4:16:01] Mecabeast: I would like to see the mythic boss kill tokens as package rewards for the vault tokens like 6 tokens gets 5 mythic tokens or something
[4:16:06] magemaster225: they should include the upgrade item token so it incentivises higher players to run normal/heroic
[4:16:13] devoted_bee: towNut3
[4:16:15] ShowDUH: Yeah like having the Dinar System once Cross Realm Mythic open could be a good timeframe
[4:16:27] Eliman101: In my opinion classic classes are way more fun than they are now. Atleast warrior is problem with current wow it seems way more Disney and the story has sucked and I’m tired of systems I want my class baseline to be decent I don’t want to have to switch covenants cause I want to change what kind of content I’m doing have 9 legendaries change conduits it’s annoying
[4:16:31] SucculentsPapi: !keys

[4:16:59] Hybridwarhawk: i wanna talk to sampson
[4:17:00] NymannTV: kills me to see that grey paladin quest
[4:17:01] Verdell263: My favorite scene in that movie
[4:17:07] neverbornlucky: I'm high right now on pain pills and medication
[4:17:10] xrandomdoodx: wow and weed were made for eachother LUL
[4:17:13] ShowDUH: @Eliman101 so welcome to DF where no system like that exist :P
[4:17:19] confl1ct10n: Down by the beach…. Boiiiiiiiii
[4:17:32] wEiRdO_dUdE: Wrath was a big step up for a lot of classes, yes
[4:17:40] ArcaneSyntax: anyone who says classes are more fun in classic are on some premium grade copium
[4:17:54] sh4d0wsky: they are
[4:17:56] delennotv: !server
[4:18:04] Eliman101: I guess wrath warrior stance dancing is just so fun makes me feel like I’m good at my class and shadow thank god

[4:18:10] Wcvechten: Kungen just tweeted, he still lives apparantly
[4:18:27] Knocx: hell retail and wrath frost dk play almost the same
[4:18:40] wEiRdO_dUdE: One thing I look at is the number of "free" abilities in retail (ones that cost no resources to use), it does speed up the play and make it easier
[4:18:40] neverbornlucky: woke up in texas with a roach on the bed not weed. It was crawling on my pillow almost up to my face freaked me out when I woke up . I threw the pillow
[4:18:42] MILESkg21: really POGGERS
[4:18:48] Wcvechten: true true, how could I forget
[4:19:01] ArcaneSyntax: wrath enhance is just a slower less complex version of retail enhance.
[4:19:02] Moobot: Towelliee will be playing WOTLK Classic on the Fresh server Maladath.
[4:19:07] wEiRdO_dUdE: Wrath DK uses runes for blood boil, in retail it costs nothing to use
[4:19:17] confl1ct10n: Void lords in 2 expansions confirmed! Writing up my article now
[4:19:25] SpoonManes: i just bought my first wand on the auction house lol the good old days
[4:19:37] TheEndIsNear777: faster isn't always better
[4:19:46] Mecabeast: feral druid? kekw
[4:19:50] MILESkg21: WHAT
[4:19:55] ArcaneSyntax: faster feels better
[4:19:55] mrmanno14: Its just nostalgia, Towel. People hung up on it
[4:19:55] itsbananas01: like sex, faster is not always better YEP
[4:19:58] bypized: THATS WHAT SHE SAID
[4:20:01] AltChillUP_: NO
[4:20:02] mavericks312: classics playstyle wouldnt fly today stop it
[4:20:03] ArcaneSyntax: and it's not just faster
[4:20:03] Knocx: thats what my ex used to say
[4:20:04] TheEndIsNear777: how fast will retail be! xd
[4:20:05] CommanderKrano: Ret doesnt feels as good as wotlk ret imo. but tastes are different
[4:20:06] Kinghorn: found the FFXIV player
[4:20:23] Aravarth: Aravarth subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 44 months! AYYYY
[4:20:29] Holysal: and stance dancing is annoying
[4:20:30] ArcaneSyntax: it's more complex, retail is just has way more complexity to the class design.
[4:20:32] Aravarth: What fresh server this on?
[4:20:33] MILESkg21: 44 INCHES POGGERS towHAMUP
[4:20:40] Knocx: you not wrong
[4:20:44] Thoreya: i didnt play BC bc class design is so fucking garbage
[4:20:45] wEiRdO_dUdE: In Classic, the choices you make are more impactful in rotation, that's true
[4:20:45] SpoonManes: classic wow was much slower
[4:20:46] Asmongoat: LUL MilesKG21
[4:20:58] Thoreya: combat is so much more fluid in retail
[4:21:04] Snabido: Embrace the zoomer mind, bois 😏
[4:21:08] Eliman101: We’ll classic pally is one of the most boring classes yeah. So that is different
[4:21:10] dannyis1337: dannyis1337 subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 34 months! 
[4:21:10] MMokuin: 15 years wtf NotLikeThis
[4:21:39] MILESkg21: wrath launch night was fun af FeelsGoodMan remember it like it was yesteday
[4:21:39] ErkTheMighty: maaaaan playing hearthstone feels faster than classic wow
[4:21:45] Scoodles91: if you pull 8 mobs you are dead :D
[4:21:45] cipusanx: dmg distribution in wotlk > any new expansion. there is a reason why wrath was the most popular expansion and why its still the most popuular on private servers
[4:21:46] wEiRdO_dUdE: Burning that sweet mana with consecration
[4:21:46] Aravarth: You pull 7-8 mobs 15 years ago and your character dies lol
[4:22:21] Thoreya: LUL
[4:22:22] nyberrite: it was
[4:22:36] TheEndIsNear777: i do like speed but up to a certain point, when it gets too fast its not fun. Look at pvp even 3k rated players can't avoid getting 3 shot BibleThump Burst is "too fast"
[4:22:41] MILESkg21: it was the most noob friendly
[4:22:43] mavericks312: wrath was popular casue it was casual nothing else
[4:22:45] Zomgboy: wotlk is huge on warmane i suppose
[4:22:50] cipusanx: npe. there were 2-4 popular private servers while wotlk had over 10-20
[4:22:52] wEiRdO_dUdE: Wrath was for everyone, yeah
[4:22:55] Hippwn: and people cared about the story somewhat back then
[4:22:58] Snabido: towCopium
[4:23:00] Thoreya: cata TECHNICALLY had the highest subs in wow. in the beginning, more than wrath
[4:23:10] Lostdogal: well I main frost mage so this conversation makes no sense to me. it gets nerfed in wrath but still strong For Leveling fast
[4:23:15] Lightninghandz: Wrath was the most popular because you kill Arthas and end the story that began in warcraft 3. After that, the story was done.
[4:23:21] rymerre: wrath was the best due to the continuation of the best lore in warcraft
[4:23:28] GamingDad77: WoTLK was all about the biggest shoulder armor....hands down!!!
[4:23:32] wEiRdO_dUdE: Pugging 10 man raids
[4:23:43] neverbornlucky: wrath was my favorite expansion not just cause of dk's
[4:23:52] BlewGamingGroup: 10 man hard modes ... the real end game
[4:23:52] SpoonManes: "oh ur casual and dont have kara attune?, sorry breh" sadge
[4:24:01] MILESkg21: elitest 10 man pugs was fun Kappa
[4:24:07] mavericks312: im upset alot of ppl but legion>wrath
[4:24:10] Naturalbeef: No raid attunements
[4:24:11] xotankkk: thats why cata failed, because it was too hard
[4:24:11] LearnedSomething: it was arthas
[4:24:15] Templexx: player retention
[4:24:16] Lostdogal: much better than the proc rng frost mage in retail, although tI still enjoy mage on retail
[4:24:18] LearnedSomething: for most people it was the lich king
[4:24:21] Asmongoat: i started in MoP and have no nostalgic urge to play classic at all
[4:24:35] Convectus: mop classic when?
[4:24:47] WonderMog: I think wrath was good cause it did a good balance of casual vs hardcore for the game
[4:24:53] DrWraithjr: People don't remember that in vanilla/BC dungeons we had to CC trash pulls. It was a completely different game then now
[4:24:56] LearnedSomething: you know in a sense when you killed arthas on heroic, you kind of beat wow :)
[4:24:58] Asmongoat: now that would be a different story Convectus :P
[4:25:03] oradros: you got a window size at the bottom right
[4:25:08] Holysal: is it locked in place?
[4:25:11] Dalinaar: CTRL left click the bottom right arrow on Questie\
[4:25:17] MILESkg21: ^^
[4:25:17] Convectus: @Asmongoat im in the exact same boat as you :p
[4:25:19] Dalinaar: delt with the same thing here.
[4:25:23] Dephunk: well said @Towelliee
[4:25:29] neverbornlucky: someone once said wrath was the end of the warcraft error as well. It wrapped up the story we had lived with
[4:25:36] SpoonManes: the dk class helped me get out of a lull so i personally loved it
[4:25:37] Rabiahtaro132: How's it going this fine day?
[4:25:48] boinkyboy666: well playing classic until DF so i am happy
[4:25:54] Aravarth: Weird, your addons in CurseForge should be on 3.4.0 not 2.5.4
[4:25:56] Broomba: your curse forge still show bcc classic? my says wotlk classic @Towelliee
[4:25:56] Dephunk: epic gear from dungeons, etc
[4:26:02] DrWraithjr: Phasing made the story SO much better too. There was quite a bit of good stuff in wrath
[4:26:11] rymerre: wrath was the best due to the story
[4:26:18] cipusanx: then why the popularity of wow went down after wotlk? i think its becauuse of class design
[4:26:29] MILESkg21: cant wait to hear grizzly hills again BibleThump
[4:26:39] Dephunk: you could get through WOTLK as a hermit basically
[4:26:50] mavericks312: @cipusanx wrong its was systems tahts it
[4:27:02] wEiRdO_dUdE: Yep, you had to rely on other people to progress deep in endgame
[4:27:14] reggiepowa: I remember Icecrown having a lot of group quests
[4:27:16] szble: Sadge
[4:27:33] Thoreya: the game also lost popularity because there was actual other games to compete lol
[4:27:37] Padarius: touch what?
[4:27:41] Thoreya: whereas 2007 there was nothing on the same scale as woww
[4:27:58] DrWraithjr: Dungeon finder is the like the best thing that happened to wow. Waiting 20 min for someone to get to the dungeon was terrible.
[4:28:03] LegoCoin: yeah giving people the choice to SOLO play and not waste time in chat finding groups was huge boost to the game. People thing DF made it worse but its the opposite. It make it better for casual players.
[4:28:08] cipusanx: i dont think so because people did not played every aspect of the game. some only did pvp and never touched the systems
[4:28:18] wEiRdO_dUdE: Without the crazy attunements, people who had less time could do all the stuff in Wrath, provided they could find and join groups when needed
[4:29:01] Ensanee: Wrath is ass
[4:29:15] reggiepowa: wrath is basically retail
[4:29:17] TheEndIsNear777: I just wish DF pvp balance was redone by diff ppl. Its been the same bursty-can't-react-just-sit-there-dead-and-look-at-log damage
[4:29:18] wEiRdO_dUdE: For PvP, Wrath is way better with personal arena ratings....having to use the team ratings in BC was pretty awful a lot of the time
[4:29:42] layercake2004: Ahh memories 2009, unemployed due to the economy crashing but I had wrath.

[4:36:23] keepcalmchris: Blizz said those bans were analytic bugs, so looks like some if not most will get unbanned.

[4:37:37] wEiRdO_dUdE: It is possible to help out in AV without doing any damage, especially if you just like to heal people, so I can understand if an automated algorithm flagged the wrong peeps
[4:38:21] TheEndIsNear777: im lvl 67 in av and i said i won in 9 MInutes in server chat and they wanted to report me afk lol out of the game in chat xd

[5:04:28] MILESkg21: M= testing and raids
[5:04:29] wEiRdO_dUdE: Yeah, a new beta build would be mostly just bug fixes

[5:05:35] skymercii: one of the marksmanship hunter talents is still bugged showing "increases damage by 0%" ive reported it a couple times
[5:05:40] KyleEverett: m+ would be cool so people can actually test content that lasts a bit
[5:06:00] Huffthegreat: Who cares about hunters lmao
[5:06:02] magemaster225: you think build is today or tmrw
[5:06:24] raldrik: Do you think with all the Ilvl they are giving out in S4 they will increase the tuning and Ilvl of DF beyond what we are seeing in beta? I think having to wait for 8 levels to get an upgrade is going to feel bad
[5:06:32] wEiRdO_dUdE: Vengeance will likely need tuning, too
[5:06:44] skymercii: @Huffthegreat hunters have gotten the most changes in i would say
[5:06:52] legarlex: I wish Prot pally had more AoE heals like WoD or Mop
[5:06:53] KyleEverett: @raldrik Nope, they tune the levelling experience to tie into what you are at the end of levelling to 60
[5:06:59] KyleEverett: So 160-190 is perfect
[5:07:05] Masqerader: this Diablo 2 desert music is fitting right now
[5:07:16] Nutsy: Can you get invited to beta if your not currently subscribed to WoW?

[5:50:49] Neowanderer: @mavericks312 what about some ultimate warrior or rowdy piper
[5:50:53] watpuppy: @Xara36 Chiefs are going to be wayyyyy different this year without their star WR carrying them
[5:51:04] mavericks312: @Neowanderer there fine and some good legends
[5:51:16] PvtHudson093: Still waiting for a Paladin blue post Copium

[5:52:06] mavericks312: @portalpimptv in madden? sure
[5:52:11] Xara36: @Xara36 Nah, I think their offense will be fine.  Still got Kelce and a lot more pieces.  I don't think they'll slow down at all
[5:52:13] CloudPants8081: cooksuXpog
[5:52:14] Neowanderer: besides kelce though who does the qb have to throw to
[5:52:17] Sokoe: whats more fun in wotlk mage or feral
[5:52:20] watpuppy: Tyreek Hill carried the Chiefs offense.  Without him, they won't be able to score.  Defenses will just double cover Kelce
[5:52:23] MoMoTheEskimo: @portalpimptv no we ain't BibleThump
[5:52:30] portalpimpx: lol

[5:53:08] PvtHudson093: Paladin blue post today towCopium
[5:53:16] mavericks312: @watpuppy they still have hardman,juju and edwards helaire
[5:53:34] Molvonos: Someone's gotta push the wheelchair.
[5:53:36] Neowanderer: the griffey upper deck rookie still worth alot?
[5:53:41] mavericks312: @Xara36 allen,williams,parham,eckler
[5:53:44] Xerevil: Morning boys
[5:53:47] watpuppy: @mavericks312 lmao Hardman and CEH are awful
[5:53:49] wEiRdO_dUdE: If they fixed relying on consecration, rets are probably good to go
[5:53:49] Tiamarilien: Holy looks kinda meh, too
[5:54:19] Neowanderer: holy pally is shit right now
[5:54:23] Skittlebeast: hpal is garbage spec
[5:54:24] portalpimpx: Paladin has been garbage since holy power has been added
[5:54:39] Xara36: @mavericks312 I'd argue kelce = allen, juju = williams, MVS will have more plays than parham, and i think the chiefs RB room will produce also, wont just be one guy
[5:54:47] Zomgboy: arathi
[5:54:53] Xara36: and hardman will make plays also
[5:55:04] Xara36: then what about skyy moore
[5:55:21] ArcaneSyntax: the quest at the end of arathi gives an insane mail chest
[5:55:28] Xara36: we could put out 4 WRs that are all able to really go, hardman being the worst

[7:10:05] Darwoo: do most streamers have agents to help with sponsors and stuff
[7:10:13] r0b928: Don’t they tell you how much they will pay you before you agree to do it?
[7:10:26] ijuki: What post?
[7:10:34] wEiRdO_dUdE: Oh damn
[7:10:40] Electafuzz: sounds like he needs a manager
[7:10:52] Troniin: is there an azeroth auto pilot add-on for classic?

[7:12:28] ronny_84: Do you have any advise for people thinking of starting out streaming ?
[7:12:32] wEiRdO_dUdE: Yeah Mr. GM does alright with viewers, he's worth real bucks

[7:13:17] tr1ckshot22: leverage baby!
[7:13:35] AngelDivRS: he has lower reputation
[7:14:05] wEiRdO_dUdE: True, it's more than just the viewer number
[7:14:23] stallowned: yup thats true
[7:14:29] Alienfromger: asmon Kappa
[7:14:34] Lifestream7: Funny because when it comess to youtube a lot of sponsors dont look at averge video views but rather total subs
[7:14:39] MrGrimms: MrGrimms subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 46 months! I miss sword of omen... nice thundercats reference
[7:15:18] wEiRdO_dUdE: Some of the big streamers don't try that hard to sell the game, they just screw around, whereas some of the smaller streamers really get people involved
[7:15:24] 91Niki: @Towelliee not to mention, a 10k viewer streamer might also not have viewers with interest in the sponsored game they play. So yay 10k viewers, but if only 1k takes interest, money wise. While a 3k viewer streamer plays these types of games often, and have like 2.5k of their viewers taking interest.
[7:15:27] 3663Sharad: 3k per hour KEKW
[7:15:31] BlewGamingGroup: there are streamers out there like  luxthos for example . he might only have a few hundred viewers . but if he goes to play a new game ... 20% of his viewers are purchasing it with him .. where some of the biggers streamers might only have a handful cause they just want to watch their streamers play
[7:15:52] AngelDivRS: @towelliee was there a sponsorship that made you rethink your worth?
[7:16:29] Daveybutter: one million dollars
[7:16:31] TheUnknowing: fixed rate seems simpler to do lol
[7:16:35] r0b928: I’m in the wrong industry
[7:16:45] ShakyShade: lol, did u see Elyon shutting down surope/american servers already in december
[7:16:45] happybooger: thats too much micromanaging, i like the fixed number
[7:17:09] ijuki: $1 for every hour Kappa
[7:17:18] trivotix: Do you have an agent or do you do it all yourself?
[7:18:05] xanarel22: corporate jargon is awful
[7:19:07] Molvonos: @xanarel22 Its not even corporate jargon -- it's the same MO of any salesman.  They work for the company and if they can get you (i.e. the streamer) for as cheap as possible to save the company as much money as they can, they'll take advantage of you all the way.
[7:19:15] ShakyShade: they are smart people trying to dig in

[7:20:26] Neowanderer: smart and you dont have to give teh angecy a cut

[7:28:42] PvtHudson093: STV shoulds be fine
[7:29:35] 3dRes: Not even highlight certain moments of a stream? Easy YouTube content?
[7:29:35] gurunoni: MrGm banned me for talking bout sports on his channel.
[7:29:36] MrGrimms: When you stream and become your own editor you never get away from your workstation
[7:29:37] PvtHudson093: you have a paladin quest turn in
[7:29:46] Broomba: i hear desolace is a nice place to level
[7:30:34] HonestPhilosophy: Asmon pretty much just streams to generate youtube content

[7:31:36] gurunoni: @Broomba I understand. But there is no rules about that sir.
[7:31:52] kalamari__: do you see any transition from YT to your streams or the oterh way around?

[7:32:23] r0b928: Do you have any thoughts on the bears moving out of chicago to the burbs? Where they would move is about 5 miles from my house.
[7:32:41] ItsGigg: its because wow is a boring game to watch lol
[7:32:54] jaalexba: WoW doesnt really have the highlight type clips like those other games.
[7:32:59] ItsGigg: I sit here because its chill vibes
[7:33:03] 3dRes: Bringing YouTube views over to twitch streams is something not many people can master
[7:33:06] EKS90_: It's the same with guildwars 2, Im trying to learn the game, but most videos or channels, have like. 1k viewers
[7:33:09] EKS90_: so its hard to get the latest info
[7:33:31] Leemann9: wut is the point in the FRESH ??? so u will level a toon to 70 jjust to never play again? or will u transfer to reg server???

[7:34:29] RipBrawl: lol
[7:34:42] gurunoni: @Broomba I understand. Though the chat was confused and defend me. It's alright. I don't like him now. Love his chat.
[7:35:00] KillchainGames: do you  agree with the sentiment a lot of streamers say that to grow an audience on twitch you rely on making content elsewhere and funneling them to twitch?
[7:35:03] Leemann9: so u did not of tbc toons with the server going to wotlk?? or are servers locked??
[7:35:10] Wcvechten: booty bay also has the plagued crates now for the event

[7:37:27] gurunoni: @Broomba Also gave me no warning talking about basketball. Just a banned. Chat was confused.

[7:38:07] gurunoni: @Broomba I use to watch him on twitch and youtube.
[7:38:16] Broomba: @gurunoni  he is a pretty strict guy when it comes to his stream -- he doesnt like BS and nonsense
[7:38:38] KillchainGames: duely noted appreciate it =D
[7:38:41] KillchainGames: take care mate
[7:38:41] EKS90_: if you have  ateam of editors, u can do some unique content for youtube, but tiktok/instagram and facebook stuff is just reposting IMO
