[0:01:05] WytherOK: morning
[0:03:02] brewteafulgaming: hi all
[0:03:09] homieakaexco: yoo Jd, hows it going my man. I just watched old rigg's weekly interview videos on youtube. Damn mna don't you miss the good old Bloog Legion times? :D
[0:05:08] WytherOK: brewteafulgaming hello :)
[0:07:01] ren0m: Good morning
[0:07:09] ren0m: What's the plan for today
[0:09:13] homieakaexco: Yah we tried pulling double dragons on 29 last night. Even tho healer was pulling almost 400+ hps still wasn't good enough
[0:19:15] Perry_TP: did they fix double ticks from that aoe
[0:20:36] sawako07: double ticks was when u moved with the circle i think
[0:23:38] KineasRM: kkkkkkkkkkkkk
[0:24:26] Guffels: that actually looked close enough to be do-able. not sure why you would when the timer is this free though but maybe eventually it will matter
[0:28:30] MicHawkh: MicHawkh watched 10 consecutive streams this month and sparked a watch streak! PartyHat
[0:30:43] KineasRM: doable?
[0:31:04] bartfux: chromie is the most annoying NPC in this game.

[2:03:57] sw0ngs: you gonan be cursed with eb forever
[2:04:11] jan2048: How about giving keys durability? You get 3 tries and then it depletes
[2:04:23] Cdizzyb: brother anywhere you think is best to grasp the basics of rdruid in keys

[2:28:07] Whitewolf1441: what happened to deplete all those keys?
[2:28:10] sw0ngs: strange you guys hopped so much
[2:28:30] sw0ngs: didnt even get into rhythm
[2:28:34] REGENAROCKET: rip
[2:30:00] Whitewolf1441: jb what would you rather happen if you dont time the key?
[2:30:03] GoodyGodfather: Good Morning sir JB
[2:30:45] theBroHam: the penalty is wasted time lol yup
[2:30:46] speels414: yup
[2:30:54] domz_i: 100%
[2:31:09] So_0bvious: there should be risk involved. or else timing keys is meaningless.
[2:31:11] thanertv: 227 raiders from thanertv have joined! 
[2:31:20] Whitewolf1441: i hate being naive so i realy wanna know what the thought process behind this deplete system
[2:31:23] Galois_rg: if you deplete a key, you should be able to pay real money in the shop to repair it
[2:31:23] hacknets: the only thing I didn't enjoy that much about the old way is that you would play hyper aggresive on early parts of the dungeon and hope it played out
[2:31:26] inspirox: how is it meaningless LOL
[2:31:28] thanertv: Have a good one Sir
[2:31:47] nixar1: there were some bosses with limited attempts tho

[2:32:36] So_0bvious: different crowd, different playstyle.
[2:33:00] NeuroTheGamer: @So_0bvious Yeah you're a bit off base here
[2:33:01] hacknets: should there be a limit on amount of resets per hour with ur new system?
[2:33:11] hacknets: I didn't like trying to pull 20 mobs at the start of the dungeon and repeating until it worked
[2:33:53] Sokchoy: jamdotb where music
[2:34:02] NeuroTheGamer: @hacknets why would this make sense? players should be able to run it over and over until they figure out what works
[2:34:14] So_0bvious: everyone should get access to tourny realm for practice and no  score. then you get score on normal servers along with depletes
[2:34:16] siaulerandom: yeah and cuz of that alot of people being so toxic
[2:34:25] siaulerandom: because of key derank
[2:34:36] Wiigglles: @jdotb if next xpan u had the choice of removing affixes or removing buffs or the gated class element of buffs for m+ which would it be?
[2:34:38] hacknets: @NeuroThaGamer its not about figuring out what works. its about restarting until your hyper aggresive stuff finally works out magicly
[2:34:43] hacknets: not every key was like that
[2:34:46] hacknets: but some of them were
[2:35:00] NeuroTheGamer: @hacknets "works out magically" isn't a thing bud
[2:35:19] inspirox: sucks when i have to use my paid time off from work on the 1-2 push weeks of a season
[2:35:19] NeuroTheGamer: no one "magically" times a world first key. it's planned...strategic
[2:35:27] domz_i: Thoughts on capping key levels and instead turning it into a speed race?
[2:35:29] Galois_rg: they derive sexual pleasure from it
[2:35:37] TCancelYO: But would it feel as good timing one then?
[2:36:08] Wiigglles: if key depletion didnt exist "go agane" would be the saying of the year
[2:36:25] GoodyGodfather: Good ole homework keys
[2:36:32] whiskeyhide: Aware tooreal
[2:36:34] PsYc86: if you put it that way .. yea its bit shit
[2:36:38] inspirox: you could just learn and queue up with the same group to run the key over too, i dont get blizz
[2:36:39] hacknets: yeah strategic resetting early on in the key to make sure you've had god rng and everything worked out @NeuroThaGamer
[2:36:42] StreamElements: restreaming live every day to https://www.youtube.com/@jdotb
[2:37:00] hacknets: I think I prefer the old system but it might be good to have some guard rails in place
[2:37:02] Jamba024: @TCancelYO yes because you still have to really good on high keys
[2:37:11] hacknets: like you can go 4 times per hour
[2:37:19] theBroHam: what if a different way would be that if the group stayed together you could rerun at same level but if group disbands it depletes?
[2:37:19] healapotamus: the priests sounded really well thought out yesterday eh?
[2:37:19] NeuroTheGamer: @hacknets if you really believe that successfully executing a large pull is "rng" then there's little point to this convo
[2:37:41] hacknets: theres no conversation
[2:37:47] hacknets: this is how some keys were
[2:38:08] So_0bvious: there would be less emphasis on skill and executions if you could brute force a key. wouldnt feel as good to time.
[2:38:30] TCancelYO: But lets say there were no affix, you would just be stuck at a 35key - Agreed when you deplete a key it should not go down a level.
[2:38:30] PsYc86: when key is failed i really do agree that shouldn't be depleted
[2:38:38] dithrica: Thought I could pug my 28 BRH cause it was easy mode, theeeeeen healer chain died on first pull and now i'm stuck with a shitty key i don't need and can't get decent people to sign up for. It is indeed agony.

[2:39:09] Sokchoy: tgp + mdi not reflecting how keys work remotely in practice is fuckign stupid
[2:39:14] Whitewolf1441: jb i feel like youre unwashing my brain
[2:39:15] GoodyGodfather: xDD these chat takes
[2:39:19] Whitewolf1441: im starting to see the flaws in the system
[2:39:21] Wiigglles: coz ppl dont want us to be HAPPY
[2:39:22] NeuroTheGamer: @TCancelYO I think high end pushers want this tho. Because it would be better to be walled by raw throughput rather than annoying affixes taking away from how you play the dungeon
[2:39:27] Wiigglles: ur not allowed enjoyment in this day and age
[2:39:33] theBroHam: JB unbrainwashing all of us
[2:39:36] inspirox: its almost like the difficulty should lie in the key level not the time sink

[2:40:01] hacknets: @Sokchoy yeah I agree on this. I would like a MDI mode or TGP mode
[2:40:12] hacknets: can't relate to MDI at all when its not accessible
[2:40:16] Suka025: It would be terrible for pugs. Imagine on first wipe/death/hurdle and half you group leaves cos they cant be bothered
[2:40:18] hacknets: makes it less interesting to watch for me personally
[2:40:32] Dermonica: are u not afraid that if the key dont deplete,you would cut the lifespan of m+! meaaning u hit the wall of possible keys being able to be executed?
[2:40:41] Sokchoy: TGP is doing insane opening pulls over and over until it works that you could never try on live
[2:40:42] CyonDru: i am for keys being capped, and it being a time race eventually
[2:40:51] litguy97: @Piaggio this would only apply to a handful of people - not the general playerbase
[2:40:53] Gaemer: I agree with JB. What about running a key till you manage to complete it? I don't like the "deplete, redo- waste time, rotate till you find your key, waste time, unlucky? Deplete again" rinse and repeat, like? stupid af
[2:41:11] hacknets: running the farm keys is just the  worst
[2:41:11] Sokchoy: TGP is doing insane opening pulls over and over until it works that you could never try on live 󠀀
[2:41:13] Harper_n7: How about we stop worrying about people quitting the game faster and worry about getting people to play the game in the first place?
[2:41:25] CyonDru: @Sokchoy exactly

[2:42:10] WytherOK: lfiskerr !wt

[2:42:35] theBroHam: !group

[2:43:11] WytherOK: Evcon_ yes they would

[2:43:15] nvnto: YEP they log out

[2:43:25] Gaemer: @So_0bvious If people already are pushing, theyll keep subbing because theyll keep pushing.
[2:43:25] rooneycs: i do that always
[2:43:35] plbbunny: Fortnite is a young man's ggame, wow is for the old like us
[2:43:41] Wiigglles: if the key didnt deplete u would fail and just go agane and agane until u time it

[2:43:43] Harper_n7: M+ run log numbers say they don't keep trying..
[2:43:45] CyonDru: would rather keep trying my key then havnig to brnig it back up
[2:43:48] anaya909: i said at the start of SL they'd reach a tipping point where instead of being forced to do chores, people would decide it's not worth it and unsub
[2:43:51] So_0bvious: lol touche
[2:43:55] hacknets: I think they should make keys as fun as possible. I think the depleting aspect makes it much less fun. You can argue that it's more exciting when a deplete is on the line, but in practice its not
[2:43:55] rooneycs: every key i depleted i alt f4 and go play cs
[2:44:09] anaya909: same thing with depleting keys.  people reach a point where they don't care enough to push them up again
[2:44:25] TCancelYO: But you logon the next day :D
[2:44:28] sw0ngs: lol bro suddenly just wanted to get food.... literally meant fuck this shit haha
[2:44:41] fuchai: for the day, not the season, Thats the difference
[2:45:01] CyonDru: i dont understand how could ppl defend depleting
[2:45:03] hacknets: m+ in the current form doesn't produce enough buttclenching moments. I don't think its worth the tradeoff
[2:45:04] So_0bvious: So_0bvious subscribed with Prime. 
[2:45:15] fuchai: if you finish out the season you are more inclined to unsub until next season
[2:45:34] dilweed88: @hacknets this statement made me chuckle
[2:46:01] Squirrely88: yeah because pushing higher does nothing but give you imaginary dragon points so people will always hit a wall in their head where there is no reward why o it.
[2:46:30] theBroHam: that sounds cool ngl
[2:46:35] So_0bvious: @fuchai this
[2:46:43] Jamba024: @hacknets what key levels do you play ?
[2:46:49] PsYc86: why not both.
[2:46:49] hacknets: @dilweed88 yeah I mean rarely do you find yourself questioning whether you're gonna time it. that adrenaline only comes in at the very last moment. I think that still exists without  the key depleting. I don't really think about depleting
[2:46:49] CyonDru: would def prefer key caps, no depletes and going for fastest time
[2:46:57] Harper_n7: Kind of like how Season of Discovery works with the BFD raid. It's not about how hard it is, it's about how fast can you do it and can you do it faster than others
[2:46:58] CyonDru: much healthier system
[2:47:11] Nico_vdM: Hi @jdotb and chat
[2:47:13] CyonDru: and it would likely encourage some to play diff characters and roles
[2:47:16] fuchai: they may but its a very very small group of people that actually care about shaving less time.
[2:47:23] Sokchoy: only man to beat gingi on LAN
[2:48:09] Mykorrhiza13: Mykorrhiza13 subscribed with Prime. 
[2:48:24] fuchai: but the MDI is all about saving time though. Like by definition
[2:48:25] Nico_vdM: What if we had the ability that was available in challenge mode - where the leader could reset the key if it wasnt yet depleted yet.  So if something went wront you could get a do-over
[2:48:26] TCancelYO: Bro i would love to watch time trails
[2:48:36] CyonDru: and thats how live should be
[2:48:41] Nico_vdM: wrong*
[2:48:44] fuchai: LIve is about gearing up for the most part
[2:49:15] hacknets: @Jamba024 27/28/29. what I meant is that just because key depletes exist. that doesn't make me more excited
[2:49:21] kelly_mac06: some of the most talked about MDI stuff is the insane pulls
[2:49:24] Piaggio: if the carrot goes from level to time surely the aoe cap needs to be looked at then xdd
[2:49:25] kelly_mac06: and crazy routes
[2:49:26] Mykorrhiza13: Best and healthiest take I heard in a while, @jdotb
[2:49:32] Butters364: I am at the point where i need only certain keys to push my io and when i brick those keys now im like well fuck it im done cause i dont need that  key at that lower lvl So speak That Truth I am here for it
[2:49:34] CyonDru: who is pushing high keys to get gear KEKW
[2:49:40] fuchai: what if they gave you a key that gave no loot BUT it wouldnt go down
[2:49:47] fuchai: so like a seperate key
[2:49:47] inspirox: @hacknets character name?
[2:49:48] Whitewolf1441: sick of dishounorable stats in mdi
[2:49:50] laedine: What do you gain from hitting 3800? Hope you get there man - so close.
[2:50:13] Whitewolf1441: lmao
[2:50:18] So_0bvious: oof
[2:50:33] CyonDru: an additional hair on his chest
[2:50:40] Icecoldeskilzz: do u think 3650 is gonna be enough for title this season?
[2:50:42] maggotbrn: maggotbrn subscribed at Tier 1. 
[2:50:45] TrustTheScience: kids be like "are ya winning dad?"
[2:50:49] hacknets: @inspirox -\
[2:50:54] Dermonica: So if the big take is that ppl get angry cause they brick keyes needed for their rio,just make it so every key rewards points, bricked or not bricked
[2:50:57] yipzen: am I crazy to think they should add to the great vault coin vendor an item that instead of giving you a socket, it is an avoidance or leech enchant for pieces of gear?
[2:51:13] Dermonica: just a smaller amount ofc
[2:51:21] turabdin: @Icecoldeskilzz now is 3582.3
[2:51:35] CyonDru: @Dermonica it worked like that before and it was dumb imo
[2:51:45] inspirox: @hacknets it's pretty straightforward question lol its okay
[2:51:47] Galois_rg: bricking brings me sexual pleasure
[2:51:47] Whitewolf1441: we have been conditioned
[2:51:51] bengreen__: thats how it was in season 1 of df
[2:51:54] plbbunny: @Galois_rg truth
[2:51:58] Icecoldeskilzz: turabdin: okey
[2:52:01] Shkafche: depletion will make sense if u also lost RIO like in pvp
[2:52:04] hacknets: it is @inspirox
[2:52:08] Sokchoy: deplete my balls
[2:52:12] laedine: You mean try the same key over and over again? Makes sense
[2:52:15] CyonDru: @Sokchoy depleting
[2:52:18] Shkafche: but then noone will play it XD
[2:52:18] Veith91: @jdotb do you play other trinkets for TOTT in fort week for the heal absorb?
[2:52:20] Whitewolf1441: @jdotb what if a person realizes this is above their skill level and wants to go back?
[2:52:26] bengreen__: I wish you would lose all equipped items if you depleted a key
[2:52:30] CyonDru: @Whitewolf1441 ?? you talk to the vendor LOL
[2:52:32] theBroHam: you can already drop
[2:52:35] CyonDru: jesus christ
[2:52:36] Dermonica: because depletion or another form of m+  one will always hit a brick wall
[2:52:44] yipzen: @bengreen__ they talk to the panda and lower it
[2:52:45] Nico_vdM: @Whitewolf1441 you can use the npc to lower it
[2:53:04] theBroHam: if you could pick the level, but no higher than what you've already completed
[2:53:06] sw0ngs: tthats called TR xD
[2:53:12] Whitewolf1441: oh theres already an npc xD didnt know that
[2:53:25] devilhawk83: chrysCry I rather see depletion removed as it feels bad when a run goes well and because of a bad pull, the key gets bricked
[2:53:43] hacknets: Even if theres upsides to depletion, its pretty hard to put your finger on it. I know what the downsides are but its pretty hard to make the case for upside.
[2:53:53] Luderkarljohn: Is this a kinda ''new'' main team ?
[2:54:06] Luderkarljohn: Believe I saw Encysia playing with other people before?
[2:54:25] hacknets: valicera l o l
[2:54:27] viinlox: picking your key lvl would surely make pugging easier
[2:54:29] yipzen: Just like Diablo 3, you want to do a 130 key? Good! You fail? Get out and try again or lower it if you want to.
[2:54:33] So_0bvious: glhf
[2:54:52] devilhawk83: I remember Towelliee said the best M+ system for keys was in the PTR when you can pick your own affixes
[2:55:04] hacknets: beta is most fun
[2:55:05] devilhawk83: chrysSipsTea I would be all for it
[2:55:09] Piaggio: maybe hes right guys, we can even out raid and m+ so that when you wipe on fyrakk you have to kill tindral again KEKW
[2:55:28] theBroHam: raiders would revolt XD
[2:55:37] healapotamus: if people want to be punished for failing a timer they could always just lop off one of their fingers
[2:55:47] inspirox: yes please add depletes to raid make them reclear every week
[2:55:51] hacknets: only put fort and thundering the entirety of df beta
[2:55:51] healapotamus: that’s motivate them
[2:55:53] hacknets: it was better that way
[2:55:55] So_0bvious: huge first pull. 1  death
[2:56:10] inspirox: makes fyrakk more enjoyable when u can't lockout :))
[2:56:15] Nico_vdM: Just add 50 tries per lockout for mythic and call it a day KEKW
[2:56:16] hacknets: add thundering to fyrakk
[2:56:27] sw0ngs: Think there needs to be some sort of penalty for "deplete". Maybe should have to spend crests to not deplete the key or something.
[2:56:39] healapotamus: make them start the whole raid over if they wipe
[2:56:48] healapotamus: now were cooking
[2:56:48] inspirox: @sw0ngs why does their have to be a penalty?
[2:56:55] theBroHam: But why does there need to be a penalty for depleting? You wasted time and got mad. That's enough for me
[2:57:08] theBroHam: Then the game isn't as fun
[2:57:24] inspirox: depletes also cause picky asl groups since people are punished for not bringing 4 ppl that have timded the key
[2:57:43] sw0ngs: @inspirox incentive to not fail
[2:58:08] hacknets: succeeding is an incentive to not failing
[2:58:10] GoodyGodfather: @inspirox There already is an incentive not to fail
[2:58:13] fuchai: I think people forget what makes the game fun is the difficulty of content. Remove that and you will remove the fun in doing it. If something is easier the enjoyment of completing it is lessened.
[2:58:18] theBroHam: not wasting my time is my incentive. Doesn't need to be an additional thing
[2:58:18] Shkafche: mby deplete just doesnt give u items at the end of key , but lvl stays the same -> wasnt it in legion (didnt play) that u deplete a key it stays the same but doesnt give loot or smth ?
[2:58:26] viinlox: @inspirox blizz probably wants people to grind more
[2:58:27] Shkafche: but deplete needs to go

[2:58:43] fuchai: If you think im wrong, explain why hes pusing 3800
[2:58:50] inspirox: @viinlox people grind more when they're not punished for grinding
[2:58:58] CyonDru: @fuchai whats so difficult about depleting a key
[2:58:58] devilhawk83: I like to see them remove Sanguine, Spiteful, Incorporeal, nerf Bursting, bring back encrypted and awakening and come up with new affixes that are fun but also adds a bit of a challenge
[2:59:07] CyonDru: you literally just watched them all share depletes of their keys
[2:59:08] CyonDru: and log out
[2:59:17] CyonDru: if that isnt showing you something then you are not aware
[2:59:18] theBroHam: @Shkafche like the idea, but doesn't work with the current vault system, since some people just run for completion for the vault spot
[2:59:25] fuchai: stakes are higher when you know you can deplete
[2:59:37] CyonDru: lmao
[2:59:38] hacknets: it doesn't feel that way at all
[2:59:39] fuchai: reward is higher as well
[2:59:44] CyonDru: what reward
[2:59:47] CyonDru: fake points
[2:59:48] CyonDru: or what
[2:59:49] Whitewolf1441: vortex is just a suggestion
[2:59:50] OrganicJKW: @fuchai I would counter with simply saying the vast majority of WOW players aren't doing difficult things and they still log in and enjoy the game. None of my guild members do any M+ or raiding at all and they love the game.
[2:59:52] fuchai: IO in his case
[3:00:11] Shkafche: @theBroHam yeaaah tru , but vault is max 18s anyways - i guess ppl r more talking 20+ (thou depleto on any lvl just sux)
[3:00:19] fuchai: their enjoyment comes from  different aspect
[3:00:44] CyonDru: they should cap key levels, have no depletes and ppl should go for fastest to max key cap and fastest times etc. healthier system and would promote ppl to play other roles and classes that they may not necesarily be able to enjoy because of the current system
[3:00:52] hacknets: need to start tweeting now. DAY 421. daily reminder to remove depletes from m+
[3:01:04] CyonDru: have titles for x amoutn first to the key cap and then more rewards for fastest times in certain level brackets
[3:01:14] CyonDru: it could be so much better
[3:01:35] CyonDru: current rewards and the system as a whole is shit and promotes unhealthy play and gives an even more so unhealthy enviorment
[3:01:43] Nico_vdM: The cap can start low ~24 at start of season and go up as power increases
[3:02:02] CyonDru: i mean the cap can be whatever they choose. tuning will have to be done
[3:02:11] CyonDru: ppl focus too much on a level of a key that level literally doesnt matter
[3:02:35] devilhawk83: Wish Blizzard would listen but as the usual, they will do things when it is out of control instead of being proactive and do it much sooner @cyondru
[3:02:37] Shkafche: @CyonDru aint it more the score that comes from it thou
[3:02:39] theBroHam: it would be cool to cap at like 25 then see people try to run it faster and faster
[3:02:53] CyonDru: @Shkafche score and tuning can be adjusted
[3:03:09] hunterzx: people that want to do that can go do MDI
[3:03:12] fuchai: people are more about how high a key was then the seconds shaved off
[3:03:14] RedxZone13: capping the level of the dungeons you can do would get old extremely quick
[3:03:14] Shkafche: yep like it was before u got score from only one week etc
[3:03:18] CyonDru: i think anywhere from 25-30 would be a reasonable cap
[3:03:26] CyonDru: @fuchai because that is all they know
[3:03:31] CyonDru: ppl also go crazy when ppl 2 chest 29s
[3:03:38] fuchai: well it is what it is
[3:03:39] hunterzx: nothing stops someone from forming a group of like minded individuals and exclusively speedrun keys
[3:03:44] devilhawk83: Like most of time, Blizzard’s mindset is somewhere out in the 5th Dimension
[3:04:01] CyonDru: @hunterzx depleting does and that is not the base of the current system
[3:04:03] CyonDru: so why would they
[3:04:04] Shkafche: @CyonDru yeeah keep boss HP to go up but not the damage they do to you after lets say 27/28s ?
[3:04:08] theBroHam: we can only hope the new expac will bring some change...
[3:04:32] fuchai: if i see echo with a 10 sec time shave, unless i watch their key i have no idea HOW they did it BUT i i see they timed  key 1 higher than everyone else i know just from that that it was harder
[3:04:35] theBroHam: i know that's copium
[3:04:38] CyonDru: idk we can agree to disagree on time trial esq type stuff but supportign depletion is stupid
[3:04:46] ciasiu92: Which Battle potion do you use ?
[3:04:50] dyntish: @jdotb What should I take Iridal, ring of contemt or coagulated blood? all can be upgraded to 489
[3:04:59] CyonDru: @dyntish iridal no cap
[3:05:10] devilhawk83: I got no faith for now till the Beta comes out, and only then we can only hope some changes will come to the M+ scene
[3:05:21] theBroHam: same
[3:05:29] GoodyGodfather: I am hoping they cook up some juice shit for fated
[3:05:36] CyonDru: i personally really enjoy the game atm but there are still stuff to be done better
[3:05:42] dyntish: Although I got sols staff 489
[3:06:13] theBroHam: @dyntish i mean, sim it, but iridal is really good
[3:06:18] Luderkarljohn: Can someone enlighting me why they turn right after the big first pull?
[3:06:29] Luderkarljohn: I mean to clear the path onward for 2nd boss
[3:06:41] fuchai: also i think blizz talked about why they have a deplition. I think the reason they gave is because its spammable content
[3:06:45] fuchai: if im not mistaken
[3:06:59] 튀매: !wa
[3:07:00] StreamElements: all my weakauras https://wago.io/p/jdotb
[3:07:32] CyonDru: @fuchai a poor reason if so. you can also spam the same key
[3:07:46] fuchai: you can but if you fail your key goes down
[3:07:52] Shkafche: yeah but their reasons r BS sry, like why feral needs to change form to rez, cuz friction ? o.O huh
[3:07:52] fuchai: so there is a give and take
[3:08:11] CyonDru: i dont think anyone wants to go down in a key if a small mistake happens
[3:08:34] fuchai: if you are pushing super high keys then you have to be perfect
[3:08:41] fuchai: but thats the game you play with them
[3:08:53] CyonDru: have to be perfect but ppl are having 20 deaths and timing 29s
[3:08:58] CyonDru: KEKW
[3:09:20] fuchai: seems like a forgivable timer then
[3:09:20] plbbunny: despair
[3:09:25] fuchai: thats tuning issue
[3:09:47] odeonx10: What happened to mythic fyrakk prog?
[3:09:53] lfiskerr: !tw
[3:09:55] odeonx10: deadge?
[3:10:15] lfiskerr: !wt
[3:10:15] StreamElements: if you use ElvUI use this one https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/elvui-windtools | if no ElvUI use this one https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/wind-dungeon-helper
[3:10:43] fuchai: but that also comes down to dmg though, so lets say they had alot of deaths BUT the groups damage is insane, the dmg will make up for the deaths
[3:11:11] viinlox: did toxic bloom go off?
[3:11:12] smoothlol: no one kicked?
[3:11:35] Vixizfx: good to know its not just my 26's that can't kick
[3:11:36] So_0bvious: oof
[3:11:42] viinlox: big rip
[3:11:50] RedxZone13: u h8 2 c it
[3:12:19] So_0bvious: nt
[3:12:52] odeonx10: jb, fyrakk prog when. Or did I miss it
[3:13:04] luxumbra69: frost super good on fort spiteful imo
[3:13:10] odeonx10: yay
[3:13:17] luxumbra69: keeps your melee from being too dumb
[3:13:19] ren0m: Where are you at with points now?
[3:13:23] ren0m: IO points
[3:13:24] Whitewolf1441: btw jb are you feeling better about fyrakk prog since nerfs?
[3:13:30] theBroHam: @ren0m 3795 still
[3:13:31] TanaseDragos: You value more crit over mastery after haste/vers?
[3:13:45] ren0m: Damn close @theBroHam
[3:14:34] ren0m: Does Raider.io ever send gifts or something to the top-rated players? Like Riot used to for top players in League?
[3:14:41] Whitewolf1441: oh yeah i tuned in to a really mad raid leader haha
[3:14:41] ren0m: Jackets, bags, etc.
[3:14:46] fuchai: First it was level, then gear, then teir, then GS, then mounts, then IL now its IO
[3:14:53] Sokchoy: liar mfer is having a great time jamming
[3:15:05] dragona92: @ren0m U do realize raider.io is not blizzard like riot is fo league of legends, right? KEKW
[3:15:05] theBroHam: we have evidence
[3:15:22] ren0m: I do realise that
[3:15:33] Lara_TV_: I share your feeling, but just as a reference, we made very little progress on our 1st night of the week, and then killed it within 1 hour on our 2nd night
[3:15:51] Lara_TV_: You see so little of p3 that it really is a joke
[3:16:21] Lara_TV_: Nope, we had gotten there like twice
[3:16:59] ballsoutboneyartistic: phase 3 should prog very fast after nerfs so once you get there the light is at the end of the tunnel
[3:17:02] Whitewolf1441: I feel like you can tell what the issue is from logs no?
[3:17:05] fuchai: mythic raiding = herding cats
[3:17:09] Lara_TV_: I see I see, still doable imo cause there were also considerable p2 nerfs
[3:17:18] Lara_TV_: Unless your issues are around cages/knocks
[3:17:23] Lara_TV_: Those just need to be done right
[3:17:34] ballsoutboneyartistic: are you falling over to adds getting casts off?

[3:21:10] Tharayel: hey JB, You think the EB +29 is doable this week?

[3:22:29] RedxZone13: Saw Andy trying to do like the first 5 packs of EB on a 31. Couldnt quite get it cause of the stingers tho.
[3:22:38] Tharayel: the +30 is done only by Seraphinexd i think, but hey... hoipe to see You bounce back
[3:23:23] Lothland: I mean the core is getting pretty "old" by gaming standards
[3:24:07] Lothland: True, but the time investment to stay at world first is harder as you get older. Unless it's your job (and a lot don't stream)
[3:24:08] Snaaade: Do you play anything but rdruid and disco?
[3:24:14] RedxZone13: I mean take Wowgrandma for example, shes like 80 or something and just hit 3k io
[3:24:14] Lara_TV_: The benefits of "youth" for esports are usually overstated anyway, but for Wow pve in particular, it has even less of an impact imo
[3:24:47] Lothland: oh it's not an age/skill thing, it's a having time thing
[3:25:52] Lara_TV_: Yeah I can see that
[3:25:53] AnnaXOXD: I think it's called neuroplasticicty
[3:26:04] AnnaXOXD: happythoComfy
[3:26:20] whiskeyhide: @AnnaXOXD yeah pretty sure youre right
[3:26:29] Whitewolf1441: i feel like you know too much about fortnite, any confessions? :P
[3:27:00] totalecl1pse_: booger
[3:27:01] speels414: buga or something
[3:27:03] Whitewolf1441: wow his parents must be happy
[3:27:04] Celissah: What about if you can buy like a  "enchant" with Token of Merits to save a the key from deplete if you enchant the key with it. But it only works for 1 deplete. So you should be able to get 6 depletes on 1 key if you take the 6 token of merits.
[3:27:21] speels414: *bugha
[3:27:27] CyonDru: how bout just no depletes
[3:27:30] CyonDru: what are these bait takes
[3:27:30] Whitewolf1441: i hope he doesnt squander it
[3:27:50] caradea_: even if he does, why not
[3:29:26] Whitewolf1441: i just hope he has wise people around him
[3:29:30] caradea_: i mean it's similar to olympic champions, isn't it? a lot of them are also quite young
[3:29:42] theBroHam: yeah, parents who can help him take care of the money
[3:30:02] caradea_: true yeah
[3:30:47] toastbam: well its similar to like child stars. they get famous, make a bunch of money. but its like not theirs. and its just kinda over after that
[3:31:10] Whitewolf1441: @toastbam exactly what came to mind
[3:31:11] arcturio77: Faker is gonna play LOL till he's 40
[3:31:29] hunterzx: faker is going to win everything in lol till he's 40, ftfy
[3:31:38] Whitewolf1441: the other problem with child actors is the abuse they see from greedy parents
[3:31:57] Whitewolf1441: good point
[3:32:37] hunterzx: maybe a bunch get lucky like with some harry potter cast. but it must be tough growing up being a world-wide superstar idk
[3:32:39] toastbam: how many child stars can you think of that dont grow up hella messed up
[3:32:46] caradea_: you could say the same about kinda every young person that started early... image it's quite hard to find the balance as a parent
[3:32:57] Whitewolf1441: we should unnormalize that
[3:33:43] Morningstartt: jedithBongo jedithWave
[3:33:43] theBroHam: i was a model when I was 3-5 and they wanted me to stop going to school and do only modeling and my mom was like no thanks, being a child is more important
[3:34:47] caradea_: i actually wish my parents would have pushed my to try out more as a kid
[3:34:54] caradea_: *me
[3:35:14] Whitewolf1441: did you see the 2 year old that got admitted to a genius school?
[3:35:19] Whitewolf1441: fascinating to see
[3:35:20] allardian_games: there are plenty in history, it's common
[3:35:33] Sokchoy: is the next activity raid
[3:35:45] theBroHam: @Sokchoy ye
[3:35:49] bebincalicious: His good looks will carry him through college xdd
[3:35:50] Sokchoy: lets gooo
[3:35:56] realnzall: The sad part is that some parents do agree to that deal, and the kids are worse off for it
[3:35:58] dragona92: !giveaway
[3:35:59] Sokchoy: maybe he will remember to turn on the jams before he gets depressed this time
[3:36:03] ReallyHandsome: ReallyHandsome subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 46 months! 
[3:36:29] Snaaade: Can we see your clique tab ?
[3:37:26] Atherions: If you had not done it you would not have realized how much better healing M+ is
[3:38:09] Whitewolf1441: aw
[3:38:10] Morningstartt: when is the next push week
[3:38:24] Morningstartt: i wanna do some 30s with my dh i have 20% avoidance jb KEKW

[3:39:31] aveccwow: Hey, what healer other then druid do you like to play in mythics?
[3:39:43] weedyy22: @jdotb starting my M+ session today soon, im unsure if i should just play standard m+ build or go treeform? playing 29s ...
[3:39:51] Sokchoy: a push week is defined as a week where you dont need to change talents
[3:40:15] luxumbra69: incarn feels so good as a safety
[3:40:23] bebincalicious: Starting to like Tree Form on Fort week
[3:40:35] caradea_: @weedyy22 i picked up treeform and quite like it tbh
[3:40:40] weedyy22: can u share your talent build i will try
[3:40:48] Whitewolf1441: btw jb important question, in raids do you save innervate for tree form or how do you go about it?
[3:40:51] hunterzx: i think nothing kabooms my mental as much as joining a key and internet dying mid-way, and getting flamed because of it

[3:41:34] weedyy22: @caradea_ yeah will try it aswell...
[3:41:43] mWallyOG: Thoughts on Spring Blossoms? Notice you opt for Budding Leaves instead
[3:41:48] weedyy22: tree reduce mana so i wouldnt press inervate in treeform
[3:42:14] Sokchoy: cool when raid when raid
[3:42:43] GrumpyKale: did you see the druid hero talents?
[3:43:12] cucumbertoessniffa: is this motley crue
[3:43:13] RedxZone13: speaking of hero tree talents, the priest one is insane
[3:43:26] cucumbertoessniffa: the intro to kickstart my heart
[3:43:39] Snaaade: How is mistweaver compared to rdruid? I love my druid, and the "joke" about monks needing 2 keyboards kinda makes me dont wanna try xD
[3:43:48] cretorstv: did u get 3800?
[3:44:10] Jrbgarcia14: @w4dafak it's not that bad bro wtf lol
[3:45:54] ren0m: So like Dragonflying talent tree?
[3:46:06] Sokchoy: yes it gets fully filled out by max level
[3:47:37] theBroHam: so an insane dr
[3:48:48] Phasedr: allegedly its just a buff that doesnt get spent
[3:48:59] Phasedr: so if you sotf wg you instead rg > sm > wg
[3:49:02] Phasedr: and the wg will be buffed
[3:49:04] CyonDru: you rg and smend the rg for the max stack so the WG is juiced
[3:49:05] holako11: its the grove damage make u get healign ncrease
[3:49:43] CyonDru: @phasedr jdotbComfy
[3:50:26] Phasedr: alo
[3:51:01] dsune_: whats your take on the hero talents for bamkin?? good?
[3:51:11] Nitruos: it makes it sound like u have to pick up the petals for the healing
[3:51:12] CyonDru: @dsune_ LUL
[3:51:16] Nitruos: dps moving to get a heal lul
[3:51:53] Phasedr: the number on wrath is just too low
[3:51:56] dsune_: 45s ads nvm ig..
[3:51:57] Phasedr: that shit needs to be like 500%

[3:53:13] Bladetykon: @jdotb what is the WA that tells you where to cast your blessings as paladin?
[3:53:18] NikaLogy: we might need to start a genocide sokchoy
[3:53:19] weedyy22: will this be added to the other talent tree or is this the rework for the "old" oibe
[3:53:22] weedyy22: obe
[3:53:24] weedyy22: one
[3:53:28] CyonDru: @nikalogy jdotbHmm

[3:54:01] sw0ngs: hard to make any comments if you can't compare it to the feral combo
[3:54:14] Sokchoy: @CyonDru maybe when druid is playable
[3:54:15] sw0ngs: then you can really compare which would be best
[3:54:25] Nitruos: likely the feral one has dots/hots as the focus
[3:54:28] CyonDru: @sokchoy NotLikeThis
[3:54:43] Sokchoy: where are jams
[3:55:19] CyonDru: I hope wildstalker focuses on rejuv
[3:55:25] Phasedr: wildstalker will have circle and draught
[3:55:36] weedyy22: catform
[3:55:37] dsune_: treants in common (played once entire expansion on a single boss if you were sweaty)
[3:55:41] theBroHam: i wonder if that will be more dps focused
[3:55:57] Sokchoy: i wonder what the similarity between disc and holy is (they both press PI)
[3:56:05] weedyy22: talents to boost catform stuff id guess
[3:56:27] NeuroTheGamer: suppose it would be all HoT/bleeds or more of a damage resto angle?
[3:56:54] verzin_: what if we can cast regrowth in cat form
[3:56:59] CyonDru: I mean it doesn’t have to be full into key oriented. can be good for both
[3:57:00] dsune_: why is the streamer talking about druid when on mythic fyrakk as priest??
[3:57:12] Sokchoy: STREAMER PLEASE TURN UP THE JAMS
