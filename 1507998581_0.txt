[3:00:38] Nokterian: yeah the queue's where insane
[3:00:44] SCARpupGaming: Ah
[3:01:12] Nebulizer87: @udrisOG they added a new pvp mode/ and revamped skills its super fun but don't take it seriously
[3:01:24] CipansR_Ayaya: true

[3:01:53] Nokterian: lots of people finished it so fast
[3:02:00] CipansR_Ayaya: D:
[3:02:03] SCARpupGaming: I would imagine they would want to see the story themselves and then see others react to it
[3:02:03] kirkules78: @SCARpupGaming FF14 viewers love the stories so they don't want spoilers
[3:02:14] onskapow: the wat moments towellie?
[3:02:27] PvtHudson093: I was in hysterics watching Preach do the new Hildi quest
[3:02:29] ironchefx310: i actually skipped my msq on lost ark so i could watch asmon do it

[3:02:54] LumeyTV: expectations for alpha release?
[3:02:55] Nebulizer87: i'm not even diehard ffxiv but i avoided all teh streams and twitter spoilers till i finished the msq, then it was so good i had to watch everyone else's reactions
[3:03:15] Broomba: I didn‚Äôt watch any ff14 streamers or play the EW until after you started EW it

[3:08:30] Tyr7: no need to farm for tier since can convert so kinda boring to raid
[3:08:36] Zeuzo: third lego
[3:08:40] Armdel: @Armdel ok i'll give you that, but still to get there you have to get past anduin
[3:08:47] asmodai4823: power isnt whats holding back guilds clearing. its mechanics
[3:08:48] cyberklinos: !uptime
[3:08:58] inj0shwetrust: Short of 278 conduits... yea this is true
[3:09:00] thepaladinjournal: corruption was a wild swing
[3:09:00] Djfarmville: @Tyr7 For non mythic raiders thats true
[3:09:04] inj0shwetrust: no more power to be gained really
[3:09:06] Tehsunman: Legendary sets Kappa
[3:09:13] subversv: blasphemy is one of the worst mechanics ever
[3:09:20] MeisterPetze: 3rd lego would wreck the balance
[3:09:22] subversv: anduin had 70!! nerfs KEKW
[3:09:22] inj0shwetrust: although now many ppl have 3k io
[3:09:27] Rudric_Ice: lets us equip all legendaries :)
[3:09:28] Zivs: people see nerfs to bosses as a mega negative thing, but if they added 3rd lego noone would bat an eye
[3:09:32] Rottencoarse: axhsara was method @Towelliee
[3:09:33] NA_Mus: it was method
[3:09:34] Rexialiton: Method
[3:09:41] thepaladinjournal: azshara was method
[3:09:44] Armdel: if bosses stay too hard with 278 gear, double leggo and 4 set, just maybe they are overtuned
[3:09:46] thepaladinjournal: nzoth was method
[3:10:24] aleksmetha: jo towelliee ur using luxthos class WA do u know if he will update them for DF big fan ^^
[3:10:41] board4life65: in SOD echo only have rank 1/2 shards vs everyone had rank 5 shards
[3:10:48] Rudric_Ice: azshara was a headache one of the most complicated raid mechanics for me
[3:11:07] thepaladinjournal: lots of people hate renown, but i would have loved to see 40 more levels
[3:11:10] subversv: Sepulcher has the least end boss kills of any raid right?

[3:12:01] NotEnoughMana: lords on a pugs are a nightmare and they get no nerfs LUL
[3:12:05] thepaladinjournal: to answer your question, its because they have themselves said they are trying to stop "degeneracy" by top guilds, and thats bleeding over into the raid tuning
[3:12:35] Effin_Steffin: Do you think there's gonna be a 9.3?
[3:12:41] subversv: @ajshadowhawk they always try and fail don't they? KEKW

[3:12:54] LeGoogs: @Towelliee Overall how would you ran the raid though??
[3:13:19] subversv: sepulcher was like 7/10 for me but i've done 0 mythic no thanks
[3:13:27] board4life65: lihuvim is still a 9 min fight before nerf KEKW

[3:14:52] inj0shwetrust: big facts
[3:15:16] inj0shwetrust: there are certain classes that are reallly stronk right now that without the borrowed power..... theyre nothing
[3:15:16] lithium364: just give me some df news ResidentSleeper its been so long
[3:15:22] inj0shwetrust: Like SV Hunter
[3:15:39] inj0shwetrust: without the tier set and Legos.... it is not good at all
[3:15:49] subversv: the talent trees could be so easy to mess up i hope blizz knows better
[3:16:00] lithium364: yeah sv without tier is instant remove from m+ groups again

[3:17:01] inj0shwetrust: They need to hire Rextroy lmao
[3:17:11] t6t6t6t6t: @towelliee goes to show imo how much better tier and difficulty I prefer in classic. in retail there are too many difficulties and power automatically grew just by doing content and getting neck levels and such. I prefer to have less difficulties and your ability to finishing them depending on gear and skill. if the point is to have a "big bad difficulty" then don't buff automatically and don't nerf the encounters just to say people can do them...
[3:18:01] t6t6t6t6t: seems its just blizzard trying to cater to people that aren't skilled enough to do the highest difficulty but whine
[3:18:29] lithium364: inb4 DF beta lasts only 4 month :kappa bfa here we go
[3:18:30] thunder993: think they might have easier time with balancing, because they will have a baseline of strength of each spec, and not have to guess how much will people grind stuff like artifact levels

[3:19:51] Ety_TV: Talents will be OK. The problem right now is why we dont have alpha, pre-order, more info about the expansion. I'm worried it will be so late that ppl will quit playing wow. The lack of content kills the game atm.

[3:24:19] michaelmm: wow2 = cata, Wod=2.5 Legion=3.0. DF maybe 4.0?
[3:24:20] tr0kgaming: Corruptions was funaf
[3:24:20] dalvynthedrunk: Id say Legion was WoW 3 then because iot brough fundamental systems to the game that they have used going forward, M+, world quests, etc
