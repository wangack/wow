[1:02:49] neverbornlucky: Is Cata like Disco everyone kept saying it will keep coming back when it never did
[1:02:52] Verynicepotato: o
[1:03:04] ArcaneSyntax: cata felt like the first time that they were changing classes just for the sake of change and they all got significantly worse
[1:03:08] dHinTrO: i'm surprised the rows are still around
[1:03:21] littlefot: its the same every time with a different name
[1:03:23] indiana__cones: The game would be kinda bland without different borrowed powers each expansion, its accesibility where they tend to fuck up
[1:03:33] Damon_Riddle: damon_riddle subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 34 months! so close to my 3 year mark!
[1:03:36] flebbooo: The way i look at it, is if the the said borrowed power makes me enjoy my gameplay/class more i couldn't care if it's xpac specific
[1:03:43] dracullus: @Towelliee sure, they say they hate new systems, but when SL was revelead and they show no new systems people screamed it has no content
[1:03:46] flebbooo: makes things unique from xpac to xpac
[1:03:49] Thoreya: yea i think if player power wasnt a thing the game would feel so barebones
[1:03:52] Rudric_Ice: We need a new character like Garrosh and not kill the guy off
[1:03:57] Thoreya: and stale
[1:04:19] flebbooo: yeah true

[1:04:30] SSD511_: I quit classic at face one and now I just back and on AV weekend and spamming bgs I think I’m doing something wrong LUL
[1:05:10] ZakuzaGB: i think the concept of torghast sticking around and being improved on would be good
[1:05:15] MooMeACow: o
[1:05:20] 2MakeMe: tbh i wish the next expansion would go 1 step back towards classic
[1:05:22] Alepouditsa: i loved bfa, i even did mithic and raids there, but i was not motivated in SL
[1:05:25] Rudric_Ice: 9.2 last patch ?
[1:05:30] ZakuzaGB: like islands could have been better rather then binning it and starting from scratch
[1:05:41] neverbornlucky: imagine people missing BFA gearing system over Shadowlands
[1:05:41] ArcaneSyntax: the flipside to the borrowed power stuff is a game like FFXIV where it's basically the same endgame loop since 2.0 @towelliee
[1:05:48] dHinTrO: tier sets make raiding more exciting imo
[1:06:13] wraaith: just not mage tower
[1:06:13] flebbooo: yeah u can
[1:06:16] dracullus: all but mage tower
[1:06:31] wraaith: giveaway
[1:06:34] 2MakeMe: wheres my fff mage tower
[1:06:37] Zeke_nl: i always get the class mounts on new characters
[1:06:42] PadidinJones: mage tower would have been nice to keep though
[1:06:44] dracullus: but you can get mage tower recolors if you have main one
[1:06:45] ZakuzaGB: yeah but i mean raiding and dungeons have been developed over years we will never get a new system if they chuck it every exp right?
[1:06:48] joe_g_433: Yea you can still get appearances. I still do them.
[1:06:48] kazzman90: yeah

[1:09:15] Molvonos: I liked Nazjatar.
[1:09:20] ArcaneSyntax: it just needs less rng, they could also make the gear from the raid have same bonuses
[1:09:20] Rudric_Ice: i thought maw touched was gonna be like the corruption system or something
[1:09:26] flebbooo: yeah i agree i thought it was fine
[1:09:31] Alexkayzz: Did tanks use benthic gear too?

[1:50:37] Blackplaguee: Max range gets you killed if your slowed and need to stack
[1:50:58] freshlife: Is WoW classic grindy or fun adventure?
[1:51:09] RocketMan23: with that inspired pack, its rough if it doesnt die asap
[1:51:33] freshlife: Good answer
[1:51:34] Blackplaguee: Community is Key
[1:51:37] NILLme: depends on what you call grind
[1:52:01] belfastcl: but it's quest kind of grindy, not lineage 2 kill 5000 mobs in the same place till next lvl grindy
[1:52:20] NILLme: get a leveling addon like Zygor and 1-60 wont feel like a chore
[1:52:51] SlayerLightStorm: Destiny 2? That's what I call a grindfest.
[1:52:51] remixonfire91: its still a grind @DeNiLLx  you still take a shit ton of hours to get to 60
[1:53:01] Shrenko: I feel like there is no reason to do M+ anymore :/
[1:53:46] NILLme: @remixonfire91 yeah, if 60 is your main goal it is a grind
[1:53:53] Blackplaguee: I leveled with people that i now play retail with and still do things in classic. This formed because of classic! I don't talk to most people in retail. Classic brung back my Vanilla roots. I talking party chat again now.

[1:54:17] Blackplaguee: err In
[1:54:34] FreeVeeThree: You can get mage boosted all the way to 60 in like 4 days, but you'll need around 4-5k gold.
[1:54:48] Blackplaguee: Save yor gold for outland
[1:55:48] wraaith: u cant get boosted in that short of time due to the 30 instance in 24 hour lock out
[1:55:55] NovaSun84: No brand new player can afford 20g a run LUL
[1:55:56] Blistz1: wait how much gold do you get for boost

[1:57:02] Shrenko: @Blistz1 they dont need to because they probably have like 20k gold and they will just switch to prot pala and boost on there instead
[1:57:06] NovaSun84: "I leveled 6 characters to 60 through the questing system and hated it.  everyone needs to hate it the same way!"
[1:57:06] FreeVeeThree: Sweaty mage you mean 😄

[2:03:02] trivwik: It isn't. Natures of orders will is good but not really needed. THe one that allows you one extra thrash stack and does 30 dps is quite nice...
[2:03:11] Buckwink: Survival needs more bombs and explosives in their kits
[2:03:17] jerseyfive: balance spec is just so good thats ferals problem
[2:03:27] trivwik: boomies getting hard nerfed in 9.1
[2:03:31] ArcaneSyntax: ive mained enhancement for 3 expansions, dont give a fuck

[2:04:26] Brethren2K: they were decent in legion but it may have just been popularity due to mage tower skins
[2:04:32] Vyntage1: Range is just too good in raiding. Until Blizz develops encounters that favor melee, feral and surv will always have an issue
[2:04:36] Vyntage1: Ranged*
[2:04:44] Buckwink: every spec is viable, ill take a good feral over a bad boomie any day
[2:04:47] theoriginalzinng: @trivotixx was just in a group with a feral that i beat in dps on my holy paladin

[2:05:01] trivwik: That was not the amazing feral I was talking about lol
[2:05:01] ArcaneSyntax: wasnt ferals mage tower really easy to get?

[2:14:41] ArcaneSyntax: anything that makes boosters mad is hilarious

[2:15:50] ElPolloBatman: swtor does release new expansions, but the content is mostly shitty
[2:15:53] Miguel85NYC: What about Pokemon Snap?
[2:15:59] Revelations45: Ted is like we had 2 more days of this game

[2:16:31] ArcaneSyntax: LUL
[2:16:35] Brethren2K: they went over 2 years without a raid right after saying it wouldnt be more than 12 months so i eventually just quit. They rescaled the same raid three times and called them expansions.

[2:22:21] Soproatlol: elden ring LUL

[2:22:27] SpoonManes: i want a gta 3 remake
[2:22:39] DeuceDempsey: alk yall battlefields look a lkje
[2:22:39] kazzman90: Na RockStar makes way too much money with GTA Online to release a new GTA
[2:22:52] Buckwink: Vice City was my favorite
[2:22:55] kazzman90: Only reason we got RDR2 was for them to put of RD Online
[2:22:56] Mecabeast: new world might be
[2:22:58] Meakis: i want the old battlefield back

[2:29:53] sperg0verlord: what you think about raider IO getting implemented into the actual game ???
[2:30:01] LethalSquirrel: @Towelliee its an overwatch skin for Mei that is being called racist basically
[2:30:06] Alexakosgg: any warrior for 4s be 1.6cr
[2:30:12] Alexakosgg: 3s*
[2:30:29] capncolbeer: Mei has cornrows
[2:30:30] NovaPrime92: thats an awesome skin
[2:30:34] Mecabeast: is the break the meta event this week?
[2:30:41] Wildside1177: Wokeys screaming racist - whats new'
[2:30:46] Meakis: @xahetv It's already ingrained into the game already, now supported by blizz is a good direction
[2:31:01] LethalSquirrel: @Towelliee its about her hair tho.
[2:31:05] trivwik: Original wow devs are not overly happy with the way bc is being handled.
[2:31:15] NovaSun84: so who are we angry at today?
[2:31:27] Blackplaguee: The MAN
[2:31:31] CritcobainTV: plenty of female fighters get their hair braided or corn rowed to avoid it getting pulled or fucking getting in the way. GET OVER IT
[2:31:34] capncolbeer: it was Papa Jeff's parting shot
[2:31:34] Sollice: Lots of MMA female fighhters who aren't black put their hair in corn rows?
[2:31:37] Blackplaguee: Never met him but we mad
[2:31:39] NovaSun84: ahhh hairstyles are racist now.  Neat
[2:31:44] LethalSquirrel: thats what I am saying lol. its a fighter hair style and people are reading way to far into it
[2:31:47] Assimilco: @critcobain facts
[2:31:47] CritcobainTV: people are just fucking pussies, my god.
[2:31:48] trivwik: I honestly, want to hear your opinion
[2:31:50] Templexx: i always picture the internet as a raging 16 year old girl mad at everything lmao
[2:32:09] wraaith: yeah its a way for them to keep there long hair without allowing the other fighters to pull it
[2:32:09] Meakis: @Novasun00 everythings racist now, that is why racist on it's own means nothing, you need proof
[2:32:15] NovaPrime92: Corn rows have a functional purpose in MMA so I'm not sure why people are triggered
[2:32:17] trivwik: The changes and such
[2:32:37] NovaSun84: angry ex employee shouts at clouds.  Wishes he quit for more money.  KappaWealth
[2:32:41] Jakosin: Im excited
[2:32:46] Vyntage1: #novhanges was ridiculous to begin with. lol
[2:32:47] Jakosin: I really want to do arenas with my bruvs
[2:32:51] Blvdman: Just came in late to stream whats happening lol
[2:32:54] trivwik: That was kind of the way that I was thinking. I think this gives them a chance to hone things that were kinda off a bit back in the day
[2:32:58] Sollice: My son is going to be in his 20s in a few years....Will I hate him like I hate all 20 somethings. Everything is an outrage
[2:33:01] brain_wash: If you want everything to be racist, youll find it.  Mei with cornrows isnt appropriation ffs
[2:33:03] Wildside1177: Cultural appropriation is the dumbest idea in the universe. People always borrow from other culturees for last 150k years. DUMB!
[2:33:05] Huffthegreat: Are they getting rid of cancer WBs for TBC?
[2:33:05] Broomba: and towelliee doesnt have 2 twitter accounts and tweets at each other
[2:33:11] Masqerader: pretty sure u did
[2:33:14] lanara233: Kevin Jordan? That wizard's just a crazy old man. I don't think he exists anymore. He died about the same time as vanilla.

[2:34:07] oradros: wouldn't
[2:34:09] Carahail: where are you ?
[2:34:14] lanara233: @crotastar thanks man :) :)
[2:34:22] zoovthepally: What did ya think of the colts draft
[2:34:24] NovaSun84: LULW
[2:34:26] Carahail: one sec I can get you
[2:34:27] NovaSun84: went too deep huh
[2:34:33] Buckwink: is Kevin Jordan the new Alexensual?
[2:34:37] Meakis: Towelliee I would love a slower paced WoW expansion again. Like just an expedition to the southern hemishere or something because it is so much high tension stuff, war here, old gods there, deathrealm fucking over, legion invasion... Like just chill, not world ending stuff like classic was.
[2:34:41] wraaith: dont you have any toys that can teleport you
[2:34:42] Blackplaguee: There is a ship there?
[2:34:57] HawtPepperTuna: DOn't have dalaran hearthstone or somethin?
[2:35:03] justlnquisitive: I mean, pretty disrespectful tbh. He's an OG.
[2:35:06] SonofHorus82: or... take the flight path to Exodar and jump in the SW portal...
[2:35:09] Crazdmadman: just fly to rutheran?

[2:35:18] NovaSun84: I'm imagining he has an interview with Asmongold tomorrow LUL
[2:35:30] Masqerader: so he's a hypocrite
[2:35:31] Korupcija_: game is 100x better now, but restrictions just suck
[2:35:40] manmower: gotta make that money
[2:35:40] jarilrpg: he seems like that dude that is obsessed with his ex and follows everything she does
[2:35:45] ceranac23: why ppl cry over collector editions and store mounts
[2:35:46] LethalSquirrel: @Towelliee you think Diablo would ever work in the MMO style of WoW?
[2:36:02] aleagues: TBC prepatch tomorrow?
[2:36:03] NovaSun84: nothing more comfortable than confirmation bias Pepelaugh
[2:36:05] Meakis: @LethalSquirrel would be just a tad too depressing imo
[2:36:15] Meakis: It would feel like a permanent maw or argus
[2:36:18] motorboatingpro: I would have liked to see 2 versions. No changes vs. modern changes. See which would be more popular.
[2:36:18] Carahail: your on NA yea?
[2:36:20] Jakosin: who
[2:36:47] gold9871: yup
[2:36:48] ArcaneSyntax: yo fuck mark kern, that dude sucks.
[2:36:50] Shrenko: Im not a classic andy but I dont like where retail is going either. I liked the start of Shadowlands but now I cant find myself logging on. it feels so stale =/
[2:37:09] alejandrogonor: What are you doing in Exodar?
[2:37:12] Polerize: yes it does
[2:37:16] jasperboy: @Shrenko find a guild and start raiding
[2:37:18] Nico_vdM: If you want a 14 year old game to be attractive to new players, you must expect some changes
[2:37:28] raymond3195: games the don't change die off you need to progress
[2:37:35] Meakis: @Shrenko I have the exact same feeling man, that is why i want next expansion just be chiller, set up different stuff, don't go world or universe ending shit
[2:37:51] Kize_Gaming: BC also had a collectors edition when it first released so....
[2:37:56] Nico_vdM: mage trainer
[2:37:56] Miguel85NYC: Can you Pre order TBC?
[2:37:57] minael1: but how is paid mount an evolution?
[2:37:58] Nico_vdM: ask a guard
[2:37:59] Meakis: @Shrenko ppl are burnt out already
[2:37:59] capncolbeer: they don't want to renovate Mom's basement
[2:38:01] TheBove: TheBove subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 2 months! 
[2:38:10] Polerize: ask the guard
[2:38:12] Vyntage1: don't you love how Classic andys hate on retial... when retail keeps the lights on? They should hope and pray retail does well.
[2:38:13] NovaSun84: but I like my "member berries" FeelsBadMan
[2:38:14] tripl3heart: nostalgia andys
[2:38:35] Sollice: Let's not divulge this in to a Classic vs Retail battle please
[2:38:39] HawtPepperTuna: lil baby pocket portal in the corner
[2:38:45] Lamp680: That the mage trainer
[2:38:45] Meakis: It's the mage trainers over there, so portals are next to mage trainers
[2:38:47] Nico_vdM: Towelliee, its next to mage trainers :)
[2:38:48] Alt_slash: Im just waiting for WoD Classic
[2:39:00] Shrenko: @jasperboy I have a guild. Have been with them for 7 years now and we raid every tier up until we have heroic mode on farm. Its a pretty mature guild that doesnt want to raid mythic. I feel like most of us are in the same boat, people mostly stop playing after we cleared heroic so many times because there is nothing else really to do
[2:39:15] Blackplaguee: The origin Bc devs prolly view whats going on with classic BC like they guy who designed the 80 trans am does when he see the car with 30 inch wheels going down the highway LOL
[2:39:21] Miguel85NYC: Do they have a Pre order Mount for TBC?
[2:39:36] vimie: WM on
[2:39:36] Sollice: @Towelliee You mean you are an adult and can learn to read the room lol.
[2:39:42] ArcaneSyntax: my favorite thing is when classic andys complain about retail, but their complaints are completely irrelevant in 2021. like they complaun about bad shit, from like 2014 or someshit.
[2:39:47] PokerFaceMoose: content, feed and profit off of outrage, a tale as old as time
[2:39:48] Buckwink: dude I love the boost
[2:39:51] S1appadabass: i want the damn boost lol
[2:39:53] ceranac23: i maybe will play just because of boost
[2:40:00] Masqerader: most people won't touch classic without the boost lol
[2:40:02] Wildside1177: The boost is love!
[2:40:07] wraaith: at this point it would annoy more people to remove that boost then keep it in
[2:40:12] Fugazi811: I want all the boosts
[2:40:12] Buckwink: without the boost I wouldnt play because my pally is full tier 2 and is staying in classic
[2:40:14] Meakis: Towelliee can't read the room to find the portal though HEEEEEY
[2:40:18] jarilrpg: i wouldnt play BC classic if there was no boost
[2:40:20] Alexkayzz: Do you get the pre order mount on retail too?
[2:40:20] Lamp680: The bitching about it is to get click at this point. It is done either use it or do not. It is simple.
[2:40:20] NovaSun84: I just don't agree with the counter arguments to removing it... It helps both new and old players

[3:03:25] Korupcija_: so they're siding with the 5% that like conduit energy KEKW
[3:03:31] Chrissfrosty: anyone know whats good for rouge raid/ dung cov? the site saids there all good
[3:03:32] Erielle04: Pog giveaway
[3:03:34] Bombayshow: 1 third will say its good, the other will say its bad, the other part will just be sheep following the opinion of who they like
[3:03:37] Glenfy: KEKW
[3:03:56] Alexkayzz: It probably is 1% indeed
[3:03:56] trivwik: Covenants sounded really cool but they are kind of a disaster
[3:03:57] BlackCl0ud: i think the only problem with SL is  releasing content too late.
[3:04:25] Bombayshow: I shouldnt lose days of grinding just because I have to change covenant to do decent dps
[3:04:26] Bombayshow: LUL
[3:04:30] dankmeliodas: I just want to play multiple specs and content on my main each week
[3:04:35] Korupcija_: LMAO WTF
[3:04:35] Dagomarus: tbh ive only had a issue with running out of conduit energy once when i was had 1 soul bind between 2 specs, now my soul bind is different for my dps and tank spec
[3:04:41] Telmorra: they increased the recharge rate
[3:04:43] ceranac23: i was more i think
[3:04:43] dirtylurker69: 2h until reset
[3:04:44] Onlyletters0: It was 24hr
[3:04:45] AstridLory: Imagine being a paladin trying to pvp and tank, cant switch conduits more than 2 times a week
[3:04:48] Alchin0: no its 2 hours until your 24hor
[3:04:51] Moobot: All giveaways can be found on our Discord under the #Stream channel! discord.gg/towelliee
[3:04:56] Telmorra: ian said the recharge rate gets increased. renown reward or something.
[3:05:07] Bombayshow: AstridLory now imagine being pve you need to change COVENANT each time LUL
[3:05:07] ascendence94: @Towelliee  ya i agree they dont have to act on it but at the same time that means people not enjoying the game in its state have to play the which  sums up to blizzard losing players  and at end blizzard the one loses out so wouldnt listening to a extent that some things the majority of players dont agree with make more since than ignoring thnings that the majority of players want czu i can understand if its just a small group or somthing of players upset but if it is a majority
[3:05:11] ascendence94: listening would be best
[3:05:17] Vyntage1: people are insane if they think more than 10% actually have energy issues. It's small potatoes.

[3:05:18] NanotronRofl: Can 9.1 get released already. I am so bored of CN :/

[3:05:48] Mr_Pennywise_: hello all
[3:05:55] Xsilentghost: just make it recharge every 8 hours that's fine
[3:05:58] Alienfromger: its about meaningful choices
[3:05:59] Alchin0: Its crazy that they are bringing gear upgrades to you on the fly but they left conduit energy
[3:06:09] kimmo_gaming: @Towelliee There is no Magni right now and they have to charge for something LOL
[3:06:11] Verynicepotato: -
[3:06:12] Pannekaker: Realistically it only affects like the top 3% or whatever, but for the rest it literally does not matter at all so it's just a huge annoyance for those it affects and practically non-existent for everybody else, might as well nuke it
[3:06:18] ascendence94: @Towelliee im just curous on that factor

[3:06:26] magemaster225: its not even like the conduits are the problem, half the time its just the soulbnd abilities that are strong
[3:06:42] NanotronRofl: @Bombayshow They haven't nerfed SD yet, so maybe 3-4 weeks after SD nerf :P
[3:06:46] Taldemarr: If they don't want to remove it, why not just charge more energy every 24 hrs?
[3:06:50] ceranac23: u can change soulbinds with tome
[3:06:57] Xsilentghost: are we getting new class and spec conduits in 9.1? is that confirmed

[3:07:55] trivwik: Covenants are difficult because Night Fae is bis for pve hunters but venth is bis for pvp hunters. You gotta choose which you want to do and some people like pvp and pve

[3:08:22] ThaOriginalGamester: I loved BFA... sue me
[3:08:29] ascendence94: @Towelliee idk im jsut basing this off a therouy that if majority fo players did disagree with somthing
[3:08:34] magemaster225: but they dont know the numbers of people not playing the game, theyre missing the opportunistic costs
[3:08:34] Jakosin: Org is so packed on classic, I went to herod. crazy
[3:08:34] oSpaced: It’s only true about conduit energy LUL

[3:09:11] Nico_vdM: "My 5 friends and I don't like this game, therefore everyone hates this game"
[3:09:13] magemaster225: it seems like their numbers never take into account people coming back or would return if they changed it
[3:09:16] Vyntage1: rofl! Imagine saying that "people are quitting over the conduit energy system"... you're nuts.
[3:09:18] Korupcija_: people that play the game don't like it
[3:09:20] minael1: i think i changed my conduits 203 times. and only on an alt, for some reason
[3:09:29] minael1: 2-3. not 203. sorry
[3:09:37] NovaPrime92: I just want blizzard to back off complicated systems and just give us an xpac that's bloated with content
[3:09:41] Alchin0: Im sure they have a simple system that tracks how many players actually use up all their conduit energy
[3:09:44] dalewalker92: I love this game
[3:09:46] DimentoxTV: best guild name ever <Placement not final>

[3:09:55] Dagomarus: reminds me of the letters ron weasleys mom sent in the move when it just started screaming at him LUL
[3:09:56] Bombayshow: minael I changed covenant 2 times fucking hits my progress like a truck
[3:10:02] Alchin0: And they can base the change just off of if people use all of their energy or not
[3:10:06] dwolters_the_zombieman: they have stuff in old contents that are messed up

[3:10:44] aldonty_: @Towelliee how do you think the end of the raid will be for the story?
[3:10:57] soth_klf: the only reason i unsubbed is because waiting 7 months for the next patch is a travesty for a game like WoW
[3:11:02] Alchin0: Exactly !
[3:11:08] Voigz: Pog
[3:11:15] Vyntage1: The community gets stuck in a rut so easily. They hear one streamer bitch about something and it becomes a rallying point. Conduit Energy is small fucking potatoes. Spend your effort talking about content drought.
[3:11:17] AstridLory: @towelliee i would switch more conduits if i could
[3:11:21] Bombayshow: soth_klf I bet you played the full mist experience with the 365 days of siege of orgrimar LUL
[3:11:30] Dagomarus: the only people who should be changing their conduits to the point they are running out is if they Multi spec between dps and tank or healer
[3:11:34] BlueBeast33: If 96% aren't touching it then it's pretty much a pointless system to have
[3:11:37] LordKain73: minimap covering the quest tracker is triggering me. KEKW

[3:39:42] uncivil82: hi there havent played wow in  2+ years and i miss it a bit  i   was wondering whats your current opinion of the game is it worth it after not playing for 2+ years
[3:39:49] khrownoes: Amazon!!!!
[3:39:52] HaxzorJimDuggan: or you could just charge $500 for an Alpha test Kappa
[3:39:58] Dagomarus: theres alot of post apocalyptic stuff on netflix so i imagine they would
[3:39:58] Borlaq: Not sure i would allow my self to get hype for a MMO from a company that after all these years STILL have not been able to craft a stable client LUL
[3:40:03] Xsilentghost: do you think it could kill wow?
[3:40:09] cptrogers123: Amazon is not really known for gaming

[3:40:13] FranciscoTheMage: hi @Towelliee hows it going this morning. hows the progress on the stream room
[3:40:19] Dagomarus: amazon likes to create new series and then cancel them and then netflix picks them up
[3:40:22] maccaruso: Amazon is trash
[3:40:29] Dagomarus: who then also cancel them lol
[3:40:30] NovaSun84: Amazon is axing as many as they do.  New Worlds is it for now
[3:40:30] Moobot: Towelliee has not moved, he is renovating his streaming room over the next month or so. The stream will be scuffed, the audio will be different, but it will be worth it! Soon™

[3:47:11] Gurtington_: ffxiv is the ONLY other game that got a sub from me other than wow
[3:47:18] Dagomarus: i would be pretty lucrative for the first few months while its still hot shit
[3:47:29] kumah_1: AoC is sub and cash shop
[3:47:46] disflux: General media distribution is shoving subscription services down peoples throats though, so I wonder if we'll see a comeback in the MMO space. Just look at Disney+, Paramount+, NBC Peacock, Xbox Game Pass, etc

[3:48:47] Vondrex: member Wildstar Pepehand
[3:48:47] Sollice: @disflux That's because people in media are smarter than consumers....People have been bitching about unbundleing cable for years....So the networks gave the consumers "what they wanted" and now you pay MORE for shit then if you just had cable lol

[3:49:05] kumah_1: yeah bit greedy when you think about it
[3:49:14] Dagomarus: tbh i think subscribing is a good way to keep people invested, ive put alot of money into wow and that kinda gives me a reason / incentive to get my moneys worth
[3:49:15] Moobot: All giveaways can be found on our Discord under the #Stream channel! discord.gg/towelliee
[3:49:15] dracullus: I heard even FF14 has bigger cash shop
[3:49:20] Arocian: true
[3:49:50] A_New_Challenger: PSO2 New Genesis...I think that is going to win...I think it will let you buy sub time as an item out of a cash shop :)
[3:49:51] NovaSun84: But Blizzard charges you up the ass for each new expansion PLUS subscription too
[3:49:57] disflux: @Sollice  - ESPECIALLY if you're a soccer fan in the US and want to watch Premier League, Champions League, and Cup Tournaments. That alone requires you to have Peacock, Paramount+, ESPN+, AND a normal service like YTTV for NBCSN/NBC
[3:49:58] Gurtington_: I'd never quit wow simply for the reason that I've invested SO MUCH GODDAMN money in the sub fees alone
[3:50:06] A_New_Challenger: *Win as cashiest of cash shops :)
[3:50:24] TMMOOF: wow never gets my unsub, been to long at this point
[3:50:37] etter00: They herd for talking about other MMOs.
[3:50:44] Dagomarus: any WOW players put in that situation would pick WOW it wouldn't even be a competition
[3:50:49] Bombayshow: which one worth picking ? the game I grinded for 15 years or this new mmo that could die in 2 years ? hmmm
[3:50:56] anamroth: ESO was premium or ESO+ so benefit for sub :)
[3:51:25] A_New_Challenger: Is anyone talking about Amazon's New World plans...when I heard that was box price, it made me wonder how they were going to milk it
[3:51:37] Srdjan91: @Novasun00 that's like every 2 years, it's nothing. I'd rather pay that than have huuuuge cash shop
[3:51:43] dwolters_the_zombieman: Shadowlands is the expansion that broke old contents

[3:53:23] kimmo_gaming: @Towelliee Its an illusion, what are you hiding? Kappa
[3:54:06] Dagomarus: as long as the sub cost isnt too high i would be willing to have wow and another sub

[4:03:56] Miguel85NYC: the first movie was good
[4:04:01] Miguel85NYC: i enjoyed the first one
[4:04:10] 91Niki: @Towelliee The first Fantastic Four was good, but they lacked the technology so bad back then
[4:04:11] manmower: the comic characters are too campy to do well in movies, they need to change their stories up
[4:04:16] dimofodi: @Towelliee what's your least favorite MCU movie, why?

[4:05:01] manmower: i dont see Chris Evans doing well in modern marvel movies
[4:05:02] 91Niki: He's too old for Johnny Storm now. Also Chris is done with Marvel.
[4:05:06] maccaruso: Captain Storm!
[4:05:14] Sollice: Oh he isnt done
[4:05:20] Sollice: None of them will ever truely be done
[4:05:25] Dagomarus: Captain Flame
[4:05:30] Miguel85NYC: Brad Pitt as Johnny Storm
[4:05:32] disflux: @91Niki  - Chris Evans recently said he'd be willing to come back in some capacity
[4:05:34] Miguel85NYC: ftw
[4:05:37] S1appadabass: Just bring him back, and dont even explain it
[4:05:38] Taz_85: MCU X-Men movies are still so far away BibleThump
[4:05:43] Vondrex: Not Another Teen Moive 2 w/ Chris Evans
[4:05:44] 91Niki: @Sollice He has major anxiety with the whole Marvel contracts. If he comes back it will be VERY limited.
[4:05:53] Snabido: Thor 2 seem really disliked 👀
[4:05:54] Sollice: I want the Blade movie to come out man. I love Blade
[4:05:54] captain_steve_rogers: I cant be storm, Im on the moon
[4:05:54] Dagomarus: yeah it seems to have RiP'd

[4:06:48] dkapocalypse: when are they going to break the arthas glass
[4:07:03] SavageCheez: Don't forget the Mulit-Verse Towelliee
[4:07:03] disflux: @Towelliee  - Also keep in mind that they're bringing back a few people from the Netflix Marvel series. Daredevil, Punisher, Jessica Jones
[4:07:03] Baron_Nutsnboltz: Also Ironheart is coming out
[4:07:04] Skylin3r: honestly the only one i get "bored" while watching is black panther
[4:07:06] Sollice: Nah, Iron Man is going to a new character
[4:07:06] Miguel85NYC: They do make a Iron man 4
[4:07:08] 91Niki: @disflux He's said "never say never", but he's talking small cameos. Not major stuff. So good luck with that "i work for disney" argument lol
[4:07:10] Miguel85NYC: can*
[4:07:10] Venkxx: downey will most likely be the "jarvis" of the new iron man
[4:07:11] jaysteea: i think she said  she is done with marvel
[4:07:16] Snabido: War Machine be like 'what'
[4:07:16] brain_wash: Tony will have made himself a Jarvis like UI
[4:07:17] NinjaGlovz: It's not the suit people LOVE it's RDJ
[4:07:22] mavericks312: RDJ will most likely be ironhearts A.I voice
[4:07:27] dv_domino: if ironman was to come back, it would be like as an a.i. like jarvis was.
[4:07:34] beast244x: tony starks suit was powered by an artificial infinity stone.
[4:07:34] Miguel85NYC: They can make a Iron man 4 that took right after the Snap
[4:07:42] Miguel85NYC: place*
[4:07:52] Brethren2K: Ive been having stability issues lately on retail, is DX 11 more stable on live or just a ptr thing? I'm using DX12 right now
[4:07:55] onous_: RDJ can play a dude that looks like another dude thats just a dude again.
[4:08:06] 91Niki: @Sollice yeah, they both love shooting the movies, but the aftermath of press junk and commitments, is what most of the actors aren't a fan off, for various reasons, one being mental health.
[4:08:06] manmower: i think Moon Knight is gonna be the next big thing

[4:36:34] Molvonos: Nothing a nice hammer cant solve.
[4:36:49] postman_quest: don't know the horde is doing this quest
[4:37:07] HolyDaizy: I mean if u already start with different timelines... yikes
[4:37:11] Molvonos: @Quest_over Its covenant based.  Why would faction have any sayso?
[4:37:16] Sollice: @Quest_over ? Is Cov campaign
[4:37:37] cruzeal: tyrande FeelsBadMAn
[4:37:38] DeanoTV: KEKW
[4:37:39] SavageCheez: Who is she fighting?
[4:37:58] SonofHorus82: it's Tyrande so I doubt a cool thing happens...
[4:38:08] Molvonos: @SavageCheez A horrible case of PMS I imagine.
[4:38:15] dalaraz: so much buildup just to calm her down :p
[4:38:16] jasperboy: Elune probably slapped Tyrande
[4:38:30] Xehanort1986: so now we have a Tear of Elune on Azeroth and one in the Shadowlands ;o
[4:38:38] Odinslayer: elune is the sister of the winter queen?
[4:38:45] Xehanort1986: Supposedly Elune talks in the cutscene
[4:38:50] oradros: @Towelliee there a theory that the jailer is after elune
[4:38:50] Saphirosa_Dragonaspect: @Odinslayer yea. was hinted and now confirmed
[4:39:00] Molvonos: @Xehanort1986 The Tear of Elune is unique amongst the artifacts we handled in Legion in that it wasn't associated with a Titan.
[4:39:10] Odinslayer: @Saphirosa_Dragonaspect dan O_O
[4:39:22] Rudric_Ice: TYRANDE IS SAVED POGGERS

[4:40:09] Xehanort1986: I wonder if Arthas lines are already in game, seeing how WoW Arthas has same VA as Garrosh
[4:40:34] Snabido: Inb4 elune is stuck inside azeroth's slumber or something
[4:40:53] HolyDaizy: Is Azeroth a flat planet or round?
[4:41:02] Molvonos: @HolyDaizy brizziBruh
[4:41:09] cineris_3: no sylvanas will still be hunted
[4:41:11] dalaraz: who cares bout tyrante seriously
[4:41:18] Rudric_Ice: she will go back to malfurion and take a long nap with him
[4:41:50] BlueBeast33: Blizzard really hates Night Elves for some reason
[4:41:59] SavageCheez: I bet she feels like she still needs to eliminate Sylvanus, just not in a "possessed" kind of way

[4:42:46] xaragorn078: huter is a stroumph
[4:43:14] HolyDaizy: I hope ure right Towel, that the jailer will go to azeroth and have invasions there. Would be nice! But i wonder how far Azeroth is with time cuz there were hints that the time was flowing faster on Azeroth right?

[4:46:24] TyndiVelspaz: odds of Azeroth's World Soul awakening at the end of this xpac?
[4:46:28] zoovthepally: Jailer invades Azeroth
[4:46:47] Xehanort1986: So, does this mean there are 3 parts of Uther instead of the 2 from the animatic? 1 in Bastion, 1 in Jailor's possession and 1 on Azeroth seen during ICC & Uther's Tomb during numerous quests?
[4:46:56] garmin1987: @Kinghorn  the pain >.<
[4:47:01] Unciatim: Blizzard... you will do Torghast.... You will like Torghast.. YOU WILL LOVE TORGAST!!!!!
[4:47:05] RageerPLZ: I mean it's not like you are going to need to go to lion's pride inn to meet a hidden jailer minion
[4:47:08] kimmo_gaming: @Towelliee So we will have Wrath of the Lich King classic and Wrath of the Jailer expansion at the same time i guess
[4:47:14] HolyDaizy: @zoovthepally But i hope theres some extra dialogue with the time flowing faster on Azeroth(while we were in shadowlands) or wasnt it confirmed?

[6:32:01] oconnorthomas21: I enjoyed Azerite gear more than corruption gear
[6:32:22] Vigi9413: it's the unpopular opinion currently but I've actually enjoyed Shadowlands
[6:32:25] LeonardLongNips: I feel like they would appeased a lot of people if they just gave us a date for prepatch already
[6:32:27] heavenz333: hey towel .
[6:32:34] Brodih_: tomorrow would be 2 weeks prior to pre-patch if the rumor of the 18th are true
[6:32:51] Rudric_Ice: corruption was much more fun than asserite gear

[6:34:11] brain_wash: As long as you sleep on a bed of inflatable hot dogs my dude
[6:34:26] oconnorthomas21: I didn’t say it was dead dead. The servers are pretty dead right now though. Like no one playing while they all wait

[6:36:25] ruivobalistico: @oconnorthomas21 some of them are, but some of them always are. About retail, i agree. About classic, i really dont
[6:36:25] oconnorthomas21: I’m in the hammer guild and we can’t get anything going right now.
[6:36:33] maccaruso: Pagle is still jammed pack with people and tons of people transferring every week
[6:36:39] rammd4wg: Mankrik horde is insanely populated!
[6:36:45] wezzlaan: Mirage Raceway EU is pumping
[6:36:50] oconnorthomas21: Maybe it’s just the server we are on.
[6:36:51] bumpstock75: ghostland is still active
[6:36:53] Shrenko: I think 9.1 wont save that
[6:36:54] Vigi9413: LFG is just sale groups
[6:36:58] ruivobalistico: @oconnorthomas21 yeah probably
[6:37:06] rocthenite: surfaras is backed with horde and we have less horde
[6:37:07] RobNXS: The issue atm with retail is it's such a grind to gear up alts.
[6:37:11] LeonardLongNips: Skeram went from one of the top horde servers to fairly empty these days. It needs prepatch
[6:37:15] Rudric_Ice: @Vigi9413  hes been negative about blizzard adding store mount in TBC and boost not TBC in general
[6:37:16] oconnorthomas21: 9.1 will save it. 9.1 has a lot on it already and looks great
[6:37:21] MistaHat: 9.1 doesnt change anything honestly, as a mythic raider im just burnt out atm. i just raid log

[6:37:33] Vigi9413: how long was the HFC drought?
[6:37:42] oneshot2real: But the Content will be ready at lunch
[6:37:50] oconnorthomas21: @mistahat 9.1 has a ton of stuff for raiders
[6:37:54] Sollice: new area for sure
[6:37:56] icyace999: can we fly in korthia??
[6:38:17] oconnorthomas21: The raid specific gear looks cool as shit.
[6:38:25] Shrenko: @oconnorthomas21 nothing really new though. an dungeon wont keep you occupied for long. raid 2 days a week, new zone is just more dailies in the maw and more torghast stuff. the people who stopped playing and will come back for 9.1 will see this and maybe be gone in a week or two
[6:38:37] Vigi9413: the new pvp season is something to look forward to if you're into that
[6:38:38] Sollice: @oconnorthomas21 Yeah but thats the same gear everyone thoguht they would be rocking with legos
[6:38:42] MistaHat: @oconnorthomas21 i didnt say it doesnt, i said i am only on because i mythic raid. There isnt hardly anything new for raiders in 9.1 anyway. a new raid? ok
[6:38:53] oneshot2real: What class would you re roll to in classic
[6:38:54] nightmayor12: do they not allow server transfers on classic??
[6:38:54] Rudric_Ice: korthia feels like its smaller than mechagon LUL
[6:39:04] Lulaboo: THursday night football is going to be exclusively on AMazon in 2022
[6:39:12] jasperboy: Later towel and chat. Mythic Sire needs to spank my guild some more tonight. FeelsBadMan
[6:39:27] oconnorthomas21: @mistahat what else do you need besides a new raid? It’s jam packed with lore and bosses, cool gear. Effects and such
[6:39:27] Chobgob: whats the new raid called?
[6:39:32] 91Niki: @jasperboy Best of luck!!!
[6:39:33] Unciatim: Honestly in my opinion.. the overabundance of borrowed power systems is slowing down the patches drastically...
[6:39:40] Broomba: @towelliee -- that ME restaurant you went to Sat -- did you have lamb, chicken or beef?
[6:39:47] rocthenite: it just the thing that bother me with that interview last week is ion suggested he wanted to talk about conduit energy and it just to say "This just in, covendit energy is great!"
[6:39:47] Grizz_OG: whens tbc dropping
[6:39:59] cineris_3: sanctum of domination, pretty sure
[6:40:03] RocketMan23: sanky D
[6:40:07] Vigi9413: if shadowlands ends up a failure how does blizzard bounce back next xpac @Towelliee ?
[6:40:11] Shrenko: name of raid is '' More Torghast ''
[6:40:20] Brodih_: domination + sylvanas = sign me up!
[6:40:24] warpride777: gonna be hard to forgive sylvanis after what she did in bfa
[6:40:31] S1appadabass: he got some of blue and a little of the yellow
[6:40:32] mavericks312: @Vigi9413 same way they did with legion afer WoD
[6:40:33] Lulaboo: thw owner is a buddy of ours and basically gave us a bunch of food to try
[6:40:36] xxcujozxx: sylvanas dominatrix tower @Towelliee thats what the raid should be called kekw
[6:40:38] Alienfromger: wait they cant let towQueen die
[6:40:38] xluckydawgx: @Towelliee Have you been back to play the FFXIV: Shadowbringers story yet? or are you waiting for serious serious WoW drought
[6:40:53] MistaHat: @Towelliee the point was for someone else saying there isnt much to do. my point is there is a new raid, that is really good. But i dont have anything else to do and i dont like conduit energy
[6:41:08] Vigi9413: @mavericks312 pull the Illidan card? lol
[6:41:08] reffan: ?
[6:41:15] Broomba: @Lulaboo had a legit greek lamb gyro called Nikos Nikos in Houston -- soo freaking good
[6:41:23] MistaHat: @oconnorthomas21 im not saying that, that isnt something good. youre missing the point. im saying that i raid, then what? what do i do?
[6:41:25] Lulaboo: I loooove ME food
[6:41:30] Lulaboo: @Broomba So good
[6:41:47] Broomba: owned, operated and founded by Greeks since the 1970s @Lulaboo
[6:41:48] Shrenko: Im so hyped for Mass Effect
[6:42:09] reffan: @MistaHat play other games? only playing wow forever isn't for everyon
[6:42:21] Sollice: Everytime I think of greek food, I think of that SNL skit with Kevin Cline...You lika da juice ehhhh?
[6:42:24] oconnorthomas21: @mistahat mythic plus, farm for consumables, work on your legendary, pvp, farm mounts if you want. There is a lot to do in wow.
[6:42:37] MistaHat: @reffan i think you are in the middle of a convo. there was legion and even BFA i went through wihout stopping..so

[6:43:31] crowz0088: @Biorrwolf idk
[6:43:48] Shrenko: -150k anima @crowz0088 towLul
[6:44:05] crowz0088: lol idk what it does i just did it
[6:44:13] MistaHat: @oconnorthomas21 also, i already hit 3k and sell them so, ive gotten my fill. hit mythic keystone master. not sure what else i can do besides get the portal which i alread qualify for unless i need to do it again
[6:44:26] Mr_Pennywise_: healer afk ?
[6:45:42] MistaHat: @oconnorthomas21 and im not bashing you by any means, my complaint is, i am excited for the raid, excited for the new challenge, but im just worried i will be back in the same boat as 9.0 when i really didnt have this problem before. does that make sense?

[6:46:25] reffan: ^^
[6:46:37] Shrenko: Suramar was beautiful but soooo damn annoying
[6:46:57] Vigi9413: AN ILLUSION
[6:47:04] Unciatim: Suramar.. had a lot of potential... they could of done more with it...
[6:47:21] Rudric_Ice: When can we expect a new BG ? 2030 ?
[6:47:30] Vigi9413: remember in legion when they said they wanted to pump out the content?
[6:47:30] Moobot: Check out Towelliee's latest Youtube video! https://youtu.be/U8-64zqVa8k Shadowlands needs some help
[6:47:36] Vigi9413: that lasted all of 1 xpac
[6:47:46] reffan: sometimes I wonder if I should stop jumping on the expansion until after a few patches and Ill have way more stuff to do :)
[6:48:02] nightmayor12: more like boreghast amirite Kappa
[6:48:14] MistaHat: @reffan super valid. The only reason i play is to get CE then just raid log.
[6:48:38] Vigi9413: @Towelliee how'd you feel about the Colts draft? confident?
[6:48:44] TombStoneMercenary: @Towelliee Do you think that was always the plan or did it come down to decisions based on corona and workload issues?
[6:49:02] Dornok: Granted they were significantly easier
[6:49:14] oopat11: might not be at plugging away next patch be alot easyier is push out the next patch out of lockdown
[6:49:27] namechange87: This patch starts to last longer then SoO did xd or Dragon Soul
[6:49:29] Vigi9413: are we calling ToV a raid?
[6:49:37] Rudric_Ice: i mean i can understand the covid shit but look at the other companies they pumpin content like crazy
[6:49:42] reffan: skipping eternal palace patch I had so much to do when I returned just before Nyalotha, I had all of nazjatar + 8.3 content to do.
[6:49:50] mavericks312: by the time 9.1 drops they should all be back in house and be quicker pumping out content
[6:49:56] VictorAvalanche: Blizzard prolly needs more staff
[6:49:58] reffan: as well as mechagon.
[6:49:59] Throdio: I wish WoW could get it's content cadence down like ESO has
[6:50:15] Vigi9413: Kwity Paye is going to be a beast
[6:50:21] ThaOriginalGamester: That Chargers Draft lookin sexy
[6:50:24] Dornok: Colts Nation, baby. I don't care about the 3rd string QB from Texas, but Kwity is going to be massive for us.

[6:50:53] Vigi9413: I wish they'd bring back Houston as a mentor for the younger guys
[6:51:07] MistaHat: I think i just dont really vibe with the expac so far. Ill probably just enjoy TBC and come back 9.2
[6:51:08] mavericks312: in wow's lifecycle there was never anything like 2020 to prep them for the last year and ahalf
[6:51:22] Festfolk: You still have other MMO'S wich diden't have that problem with the pandemic
[6:51:26] MasterNeff: I hope Rodgers doesn't leave the packers
[6:51:28] Shrenko: @MistaHat
[6:51:29] Shrenko: same
[6:51:31] jamarky23: Kinda ironic that for a place where souls go Shadowlands is so soulless of an expansion
[6:51:32] LeonardLongNips: I think with stronger leadership they wouldnt have dropped the ball as much
[6:51:41] Rudric_Ice: LUL True
[6:51:44] oopat11: pandemic cant blame them
[6:51:45] Tyvokkaa: I hope he DOES leave the Packers
[6:51:46] Arocian: Didn't some of them need to evacuate at some point because of fires in CA?
[6:51:53] capncolbeer: Would you rather have a strict  release schedule for patch content, or rather have the content be of Blizzard quality & polish? Because you can't have both.
[6:51:59] Dornok: The bigger the project, the more obvious an issue Covid was. Smaller companies with smaller MMOs didn't struggle as much, for obvious reasons.
[6:52:01] nightmayor12: like they didnt use ventrilo or discord before the pandemic
[6:52:09] Rudric_Ice: pandemic made people lazy
[6:52:22] Draahl: Draahl subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 89 months! yeaeaarz!
[6:52:32] reffan: playing a lot of valheim atm
[6:52:33] VictorAvalanche: do you have proof that pandemic made ppl lazy?
[6:52:34] DewWut: it was massively difficult for the software company my bro in law works for to transfer to WFH, and they arent even all that big, getting the VPN network scaled took weeks
[6:52:35] MistaHat: @Shrenko thanks people in this chat think i hate the game lol I can just not vibe with the current content or the ideas and just come back when it gets better. i can still love the game
[6:52:48] Draahl: i work for an isp, with thousands of employees, i can say it was a huge difference working from home then from the office for me atleast
[6:53:05] ThaOriginalGamester: I hope Aaron Rogers goes to the Saints somehow and just battles it out with Tom
[6:53:07] Vigi9413: How long before Covid is a bad excuse
[6:53:14] Vigi9413: I think we've reached that point
[6:53:18] MistaHat: @Vigi9413 yesterday lol
[6:53:38] DeanoTV: covid screwed the whole world u really can't blame blizz for that
[6:53:53] LeonardLongNips: Is it different? We are still waiting just for some dates? Not sure why they don't appease people and let us know when things are happening for classic.
[6:53:58] capncolbeer: Want a strict release schedule for patch content, or rather the content be of Blizzard quality & polish? Because you can't have both.
[6:54:00] DewWut: @Vigi9413 id give em till next year, at least let them get back in the office, everything is just on a different, further out regarless
[6:54:01] kslma: towHi
[6:54:03] Dornok: Now India is getting slammed. An epicenter of the world with that much density.. Hate to see it, and it's going to be difficult moving forward for them.
[6:54:07] xaleen1: sweeping statements; our department increased productivity working from home, statisticallly. Depends whats being done at home and what can be done
[6:54:10] MistaHat: @DeanoTV i think it is fair to not be happy if they are behind and they still except a 15 payment
[6:54:11] mavericks312: and on top of covid blizz had to deal with the wildfires evacuating ppl
[6:54:16] Shrenko: @MistaHat yeah its annoying. Im not liking where retail is heading either. Its like they just save the expansion towards the end, like they did in Legion and BFA. I think people will come back for 9.1 and realize its just more of the same and quit after a week or two again. We all know that 9.3 will be the big thing
[6:54:37] smashwow: did it screw the world yes. but other companies adjusted. and are as effective in a WFH model.
[6:54:54] DeanoTV: @MistaHat but people knew they would be behind and still pay
[6:54:54] MistaHat: @Shrenko yeah i agree with you 100% the only difference with me is that i spent more time in the game at this point lol
[6:55:02] bonebolts: wait... we're gonna have to wait LONGER than next month for 9.1? ManChicken
[6:55:02] flandre619: you think tbc is coming soon? they havent even put the prepatch on ptr, and i feel like itll last forever
[6:55:03] MistaHat: @DeanoTV ok?
[6:55:04] Rudric_Ice: 9.2 will be hype Tier sets ? LUL
[6:55:30] Moobot: All giveaways can be found on our Discord under the #Stream channel! discord.gg/towelliee
[6:55:33] LeonardLongNips: just not sure why they dont give us dates for prepatch/tbc already
[6:55:38] Lopfi: @Towelliee what happened to you and your old room?
[6:55:49] IverCold: I think that 9.2 will be realeased in two months
[6:55:50] D3m0nHunt3r666: !room
[6:55:50] Moobot: @D3m0nHunt3r666 Towelliee has not moved, he is renovating his streaming room over the next month or so. The stream will be scuffed, the audio will be different, but it will be worth it! Soon™
[6:55:50] mavericks312: ask cyber punk how working from home went lol
[6:55:54] Vigi9413: building a patch from home is a little different than "most companies"
[6:55:58] Shrenko: @MistaHat me and my guild is just playing until we have heroic mode on farm mode. looks like most of us take a pause, when we see people cancel their subs after time goes by
[6:55:59] bonebolts: @boomernights 7 years of love Kappa
[6:56:05] IverCold: And than after will be TBC
[6:56:09] nightmayor12: cyberpunk
[6:56:23] MasterNeff: @Towelliee When do you think they will release TBC prepatch? I wanna try to get a draenei shaman to 60 before full release
[6:56:31] zgag: @Towelliee What were your thoughts on the colts draft?  Good  / bad ect
[6:56:31] Vigi9413: I'm in to Outriders right now, but it seems everyone else now isn't lol
[6:56:37] Shrenko: @MasterNeff in two weeeks
[6:56:38] Vigi9413: did it die that quick?
[6:56:55] MasterNeff: @Shrenko PogChamp thanks !
[6:57:19] Rudric_Ice: people playing Titanfall 2 out of nowhere
[6:57:28] reffan: shouldve just called it cyberpunk 2020, cause playing through it, compared to what we had in real life, the game felt like utopia not dystopia
[6:57:37] Breakers__: Would y'all recommend buying the Chronicle Books (1-3) if you're into the Lore of WoW?
[6:57:37] Moobot: Check out Towelliee's latest Youtube video! https://youtu.be/U8-64zqVa8k Shadowlands needs some help

[6:57:45] Shrenko: Titanfall 2 is popping off right now because of Apex Legends is getting Titans in next patch
[6:57:49] ZagFan590: Around 10kish I think
[6:57:54] MrGattz: @Yadkin_ i would for sure!
[6:57:57] gurnt4: servers are still unplayable for multiplayer
[6:58:09] Mecabeast: im playing still

[6:58:43] eddouble93: what UI is this
[6:58:44] jamarky23: Battlerite
[6:58:51] Gamer_Bulletxxx: AND getting kicked as the drop pod opens and losing loot
[6:58:52] dv_domino: i still play outriders, though have other games that are more of a priority.
[6:58:57] Mecabeast: servers are bad if you get paired with a console players

[6:59:06] ravimatrixx: later towelliee
[6:59:11] LeonardLongNips: @Towelliee If they don't announce prepatch today/tomorrow, what do you think is the hold up? Doesn't it make sense to release these type of things to try and appease people while they work on 9.1/tbc launch?
[6:59:16] NILLme: ppl saying that its mostly smurfs (people buying new accounts to play at lower ranks)
[6:59:18] Babyface_0: what's in your vape @Towelliee ?

[7:04:59] Shrenko: @leogaming83 lvling is like 80% of classic, you have to enjoy it really. hitting lvl 60 doesnt make a difference other than that you get invited to raids :P
[7:05:02] Broomba: what someone coming into towelliee and demand a command word be removed :O
[7:05:24] TheRiwen: SL is just boring
[7:05:29] Rudric_Ice: will you have different notifiers for TBC ?

[7:05:58] BlueBeast33: How people are still raiding at this point is beyond me
[7:06:06] kslma: SL wouldn't be boring if they released the content faster
[7:06:14] Vigi9413: I feel like everytime they do legendaries it doesn't go as well as blizz hopes

[7:08:37] Ferkan8: 777
[7:08:47] xmedpakx: but those spicy phials

[7:09:19] oSpaced: that sounds epic
[7:09:34] charley0825: Is your health okay?
[7:09:43] Vigi9413: I wish they would get rid of the 2 week wait when going back to an old Covenant

[7:10:53] Vigi9413: we want tier sets but we don't want borrowed power, the wow community is so confusing
[7:11:10] TheRiwen: just remove borred power
[7:11:14] NILLme: i still miss my corruption :(
[7:11:52] wtfbbqsauce: we better not bitch about tier sets. we want them to stay
[7:11:52] YNR_Chewmiester: I really need to commit to WoW again. I can't decide between Classic or Shadowlands. I'll play one for a few days and then not log on for another few weeks. Thoughts on Priest healing for someone trying to get back into retail?
[7:11:56] GodTheMechanic: My big issue with the level of borrowed power is just how awful the comedown feels at the end patch/start of the new expac
[7:11:58] pavepawns: i never wanted tier sets
[7:11:59] stoutside: i dont think anyone wanted tier sets to go tho
[7:12:01] Funderik: blizzard can;t win regardless, we need to accept that
[7:12:04] TombStoneMercenary: We want what we want until we get what we want.......
[7:12:04] mavericks312: the worse community to listen to is the wow communtiy
[7:12:06] TheRiwen: we will have tier set but not the others borrow powers
[7:12:11] BlueBeast33: Tier sets are great, conduits though can gtfo
[7:12:13] Unciatim: I think the real issue is the stripping of power from us.... then giving us that same power as borrowed...
[7:12:27] D3m0nHunt3r666: :D
[7:12:46] stoutside: cant wait to have a monk tier set transmog
[7:12:47] xmedpakx: lol
[7:12:47] xXSiebzehnXx: Get good KEK
[7:12:58] Z3r0Fear: @Towelliee WoW problems towTinfoil
[7:13:00] Vigi9413: next xpac will be Artifact weapon combined with azerite gear and corruption
[7:13:03] Volkmargrim: Problem is your char from Vanilla to WOTLK grew, now you reset every expac
[7:13:18] TheRiwen: it is bad
[7:13:40] SpoonManes: too many new powers is problem, them scaling back was needed unless we wanted gear ratings(lol) over 9000
[7:13:44] BlueBeast33: Ion admitted though that they need to find a better balance
[7:13:46] Z3r0Fear: @Towelliee Do you think Blizzard is working on WoW 2?
[7:13:47] veeta1: if they could execute that strategy it'd be cool, but its like they shoot themselves in the foot every update
[7:13:51] Volkmargrim: They are the same system with new paint lol
[7:13:51] Freakzene: Trying to finish School of hard knocks achievement today :D
[7:14:06] Funderik: the community don't know what they want.
[7:14:14] LeonardLongNips: I just want my character to grow every expac as we get stronger. Not get a different weapon or power up from various gods that get taken away every expac.
[7:14:21] Knocx: bump borrowed power, give me new cool ablilites when i level
[7:14:24] SuperZuer: SuperZuer subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 87 months! 
[7:14:38] YNR_Chewmiester: @trajan_aurelius I mean, kinda. Every expansion there are greens in the starting zones that equal or almost as good as epics. I will say that WotLK was the last time I was "hardcore"
[7:14:47] Vigi9413: bring back old survival hunter
[7:14:50] Z3r0Fear: @LeonardLongNips We want the anime Overlord powers of Ainz!
[7:14:55] Shrenko: what I hate about WoW is that they are adding new systems every expansion that is just gone or useless the next expansion. Like in ESO, FF14 and GW2 the system they are adding stays relevant even years later... You can say the same about the zones
[7:14:59] Unciatim: @Knocx Exactly... and not the abilities I had 3 expac ago that you took from me...
[7:15:10] Scojan: Did you experience weight gain during the pandemic not being able to go to they gym? @Towelliee
[7:15:40] Z3r0Fear: @Towelliee Paladin equipment lol
[7:15:52] Vigi9413: like the ice wall for frost mages
[7:15:58] Vigi9413: I'm gonna hate it in pvp but it's different
[7:16:00] veeta1: new games accumulate content over time, blizz deletes their content every expac
[7:16:01] LeonardLongNips: Sick! I lost these abilities 3 expacs ago, but now I get them back after all these years under the guise of a legendary or borrowed power! Heck ya! original!

[7:45:21] O1evar: :tf:
[7:45:30] GrayBush420: What nameplate addon is that?
[7:45:31] BillFknMurray: insurance costs are adjusted based on credit score
[7:45:32] wednesjae: oh nice love that for Washington
[7:45:41] BillFknMurray: which is.. almost predatory
[7:45:47] chrslp: 100%
[7:45:56] Aravarth: your insurance rates are based on your credit score
[7:46:00] Wildside1177: @BillFknMurray That is outright predatory.
[7:46:07] maccaruso: @Towelliee i.e. they can't use your credit score to up your insurance payments
[7:46:17] chrslp: Insurance used to be based on your claims and such but now they use your credit score to raise your rates

[7:46:51] Aravarth: Sounds correct
[7:47:25] Z3r0Fear: @Towelliee hunter pet cleaves the room lmao
[7:47:30] chrslp: Yeah so its just off your past claims, tickets, and then stuff about the value of the car and likelihood of accident
[7:47:52] Aravarth: I mean, wouldn't it make sense to be able to base your insurance rates on your driving history?
[7:48:00] Freakzene: Dwarves <3
[7:48:02] Aravarth: like if you're a shit driver and totalled four cars, your insurance SHOULD cost more
[7:48:18] chrslp: They factor that in too along with your credit score
[7:48:48] maccaruso: Just waiting on that multi-shot pull
[7:48:51] A_Klimas: warrior got stuck in the air and the boss reset
[7:48:54] chrslp: But that should really be the only thing along with your cars value to base your insurance on
[7:48:56] Erielle04: GL all on the giveaway
[7:49:15] Aravarth: Your driving history? Yeah.
[7:49:21] Aravarth: and past claims etc
[7:49:23] rsimpson105: more beta keys lets goooooooo
[7:49:29] Aravarth: credit score shouldn't factor into it at all
[7:49:44] MrGattz: credit score only affects you buying a car
[7:49:51] chrslp: Like I have just a single 5mph over ticket on my record and I'm paying $338/month for my insurance
[7:49:57] MrGattz: insurance doesnt affect anything unless you get into a crash or something
[7:50:01] UnkLSam39: anyone know how many 60's T has?
[7:50:05] Yagr6: gameplay wise is there a big change from classic to TBC?
[7:50:19] chrslp: @MrGattz They base your insurance rate off of your credit score and driving history
[7:50:22] Aravarth: @chrslp How new is your car? What age bracket do you fit into? Make/model of car?
[7:50:44] TheRiwen: TBC is fun :)
[7:50:52] Yagr6: I ask bc im a retail andy
[7:50:55] LeonardLongNips: once you hit 25 your insurance rates go down as well
[7:50:55] metavahn231: tbc is the classic+ we wanted
[7:50:59] chrslp: 2020 Charger Scat Pack Widebody bought new and am 28 LUL @Aravarth
[7:51:00] MrGattz: @chrslp i think that depends. i have a 806 credit score and never been in a single fender bender and my car insurance is stupid high because im young. its a fucking joke.

[7:51:29] chrslp: Sometimes it helps but for the most part its a huge scam
[7:51:35] Aravarth: I mean, you're past 25, so there's that
[7:51:44] LeonardLongNips: @MrGattz They definitely do it very often. So much so states are now making it illegal.
[7:51:44] Aravarth: but if it's a new car, and it's a muscle car, the rates are gonna be higher on those
[7:51:45] MrGattz: @chrslp also true. to bad its required by law at least here.
[7:52:03] chrslp: Yea and Chargers have a high rate of theft lol
[7:52:08] MadBomberXX: bc was a great time even when raids failed lol
[7:52:31] Yagr6: isnt jewel crafting the tits in TBC?
[7:52:34] chrslp: But still, $338 is a car payment for a lot of people...not an insurance payment lol

[7:56:09] Aravarth: my investment banker does 10% growth year over year

[7:58:51] Prideth: Unlucky
[7:58:54] Aravarth: as best you can manage, pay your CC's off in full every month to improve the credit rating
[7:59:00] Aravarth: it also makes it so that you're not spending beyond your means
[7:59:09] khrownoes: its nothing but boosts
[7:59:19] chrslp: Yea I use my cards for my gas in my car and pay off in full
