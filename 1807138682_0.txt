[1:03:16] Pitchguest: Don't worry, you'll ding just as you're about to die
[1:03:34] encoda: Love swifty from the uk FortOne
[1:04:06] Lexon7: be carefull these raptors respawn quite quickly
[1:04:24] Pitchguest: Looks like you did better with dual wield
[1:04:46] Horvv: xar about to ding 60
[1:04:55] Pitchguest: But do you have as much weapon skill with two handers as you do one handers?
[1:04:57] dhdk: the one u killed before was level 27
[1:05:00] Liebkraft: mob was also lower level
[1:05:01] dhdk: that one was 24
[1:05:05] Garda11b1p: dual is a lot faster
[1:05:20] WOOPsWOOP: the weapons attack alot faster
[1:05:21] Topic96: we love you Swifty
[1:05:28] spongeyd17: 2 hander for life
[1:05:36] ptfe89: as long as you kill green mobs dual wield is fine
[1:05:51] snute100: ur 1 hand weapons must be pretty good then
[1:06:45] BoricuaSJ: Watch out you got a Cat druid stalking behind you.. :P
[1:07:03] Pitchguest: What's that bag addon you're using? I want to use it myself
[1:07:22] Pitchguest: Holy crap, that's a lot of macros
[1:08:22] nulvijfeenvijf: hello Swifty did u get any close encounters
[1:08:24] Brokenswordx: Hey guys I am starting a new HC character... Are there rules for me playing with friends and questing together?
[1:08:31] wagyu_88: I thought u were going FULL deep prot Tank warr
[1:08:47] MERKYVED: @Brokenswordx read the rules ingame in the hc addon.
[1:08:54] Liebkraft: @Brokenswordx there's duos and trios i think
[1:08:56] keshel: yes theres duos and trios
[1:09:03] meatpockette: you can start duo
[1:09:07] meatpockette: or trios

[1:09:28] x_praxy_x: Gotta start at the same time and the same starting point
[1:09:40] sewer_creature: is hardcore the most fun u've had in PVE for years?
[1:09:41] Brokenswordx: I got you... Cool.
[1:10:04] MERKYVED: what people do is make one char for duos and then make another to play when theyre solo.
[1:10:14] MERKYVED: that way that can either play when their friend is online or just solo lvl on another one.

[1:11:17] Brokenswordx: For HC?
[1:11:20] land__shark_: Why is your verifation status failed?
[1:11:22] Galdrena: !server
[1:11:22] StreamElements: Swifty is on  Bloodsail Buccaneers (RP) for hardcore on Classic servers. For Retail and others type !realm.
[1:11:24] QuinHelmisch: oh, where was you death?

[1:12:17] WindblowBJJ: I cant imagine being a mod for this addon and having to go through all the appeals
[1:12:20] MERKYVED: @Pitchguest its probably bagnon
[1:12:36] dakken89: lol
[1:12:37] Pitchguest: Oh, Bagnon
[1:12:37] llebocat03: lol still funny tho

[1:12:54] Dann_Oh: I just started HC today so pumped playing it
[1:13:04] Brokenswordx: @MERKYVED  It just sucks because it is full.
[1:13:05] wagyu_88: a lot less grief on horde
[1:13:15] nulvijfeenvijf: it says so, you failed Kappa
[1:13:15] spliffz92: you verify isnt 99.9 so it counts
[1:13:42] Noonyoo: its gonna be great cause trollers also have 1 life
[1:13:49] dageki9: wasnt already a iron will or something called like, for the iron man runs?
[1:13:53] DevineSpIkE: but the trolls currently are non HC players
[1:13:59] Liebkraft: like, kiting a world boss into orgrimma kinda level?
[1:14:04] DevineSpIkE: so it would be less on an official HC server
[1:14:07] frostone1: 40 euro to re-verify
[1:14:28] Pitchguest: Xaryu's 3 bars away from dinging 60
[1:14:35] Rad_Red15: Impossible
[1:14:43] Rad_Red15: Need more than a weapon..
[1:14:50] Nykor0: Hardcore pvp server would be fun but impossible
[1:14:55] BudSack: naked leveling sounds fun
[1:15:10] Rad_Red15: Xaryu is on easy mode playing a mage
[1:15:36] Pitchguest: Isn't there a video of a guy who got both the nudist achievement and the no damage achievement?
[1:15:44] Pitchguest: And hit 60?
[1:16:13] Pitchguest: I'm pretty sure I saw a video like that. Maybe I dreamt it.
[1:16:20] Chasetyler14: how would that be possible @Pitchguest
[1:16:25] QuinHelmisch: druid is very good too, you can kill every elite
[1:16:29] zoggzey: zoggzey subscribed at Tier 1.

[1:17:08] kennchy1337: i don't get the dungeon restrictions etc.
[1:17:09] Brokenswordx: I am so excited to start playing wow again like the good old days.
[1:17:26] TechGamerDad: @swifty is there any restrictions on addons for HC?
[1:17:49] Pitchguest: @buttnarcknosis That's what I've noticed playing Classic is that a lot more people are respectful than on Retail. Maybe that's a side effect of the way vanilla was made?
[1:18:13] wagyu_88: yea Xaryu plays the eziest class for HC. he did on all ohers Kappa
[1:18:17] Dann_Oh: Rogue you can sap 1 and blind 1
[1:18:21] wagyu_88: died
[1:18:25] Pitchguest: You kind of need to be kind or you won't get invited to groups.
[1:18:37] Rad_Red15: Xaryu cracks me up saying mage is a challenge. He trolls cause he knows it's easy
[1:19:00] wagyu_88: so ez

[1:19:45] fractalshow: without chair only standing
[1:19:52] Liebkraft: i bet one of the guys who came up with the rules was a mage who didn't want to trade their water all the time. hence they don't allow to trade conjured items LUL
[1:19:58] murky_dirk: imagine playing hardcore using only the foot pad
[1:20:00] Pitchguest: Playing Hardcore as a clicker.
[1:20:01] DevineSpIkE: remove macros xD
[1:20:04] josteinur: are you specced fury? could you say a bit why you choose skinning/lw?

[1:21:38] olivertrojahn: Its such a grind. Takes a lot of time tbh. People like asmon who reacts to stuff for content doesnt have time for HC :3
[1:21:39] jredbingo: The addon tracks if u did
[1:21:41] atakatana: isnt there hall of fame on hc website ?
[1:21:48] Rad_Red15: They should build that into the ad on bear some kind of verification
[1:21:49] Dann_Oh: Doesn't the addon track ?
[1:21:50] BudSack: that's why they use the addon
[1:22:01] chaski_: u can inspect people there is a "HC" tab
[1:22:12] DevineSpIkE: hardcore servers are 100% coming, it's been datamined.
[1:22:13] spliffz92: then it wont verify
[1:22:16] Adradia: i think there was a feast of strenght in wotlk classic for ppl that level to 60 without dying in season of mastery
[1:22:17] Rad_Red15: Like I like the % of use u showed thats a start
[1:22:27] TheCrede: Yes
[1:22:27] jredbingo: It has to track the whole time
[1:22:36] Nykor0: 29
[1:22:37] Cnith: *29
[1:22:37] wsnow_x: the addon times you and everything per level
[1:22:38] TheCrede: It will unverify u if u'have played without the addon
[1:22:42] noble_daf: 27?
[1:22:54] fractalshow: 31 to go
[1:22:57] Rad_Red15: Can require 100% up time on addon and then have it written to build a list of names that have met the requirement
[1:23:00] Dann_Oh: Grants!
[1:23:05] noble_daf: you said 27 :D
[1:23:05] Dann_Oh: Grats*
[1:23:11] Rad_Red15: And then have that active list somewhere
[1:23:14] EliBourne: so this whole concept depends on an addon
[1:23:14] Liebkraft: right now, it's really a challenge you give to you. so, if you cheat, you really only cheat yourself
[1:23:18] wagyu_88: Stockades time!!! cmon
[1:23:20] fractalshow: because of the raptors they were 27
[1:24:16] neevir: The issue with blizzard making an hardcore server is that it is unlikely that they will implement all the rules making the challenge hard, for example no trading or ah
[1:24:43] gfan11: @neevir y not if everyone knows what it is
[1:24:47] nulvijfeenvijf: when blizz hc servs drop theyll all be dead so dw Kappa
[1:25:00] Rad_Red15: Guys trading is gonna be needed...
[1:25:00] kennchy1337: why would you not allow trading when everyone is hc
[1:25:05] Liebkraft: @neevir i think the issue with blizzard is they add hc servers when the hype is already over
[1:25:07] Rad_Red15: GL raiding
[1:25:10] BigZevs: Ppl cheat just because of that they are not good at the gane or shall have stats / gears to flex
[1:25:21] wagyu_88: What is it about kids these days. they have no remorse on cheating. they have no self conf
[1:25:24] NakedLobster6: change rooms?

[1:25:28] StreamElements: Swifty is moving to a new location soon, so he took his studio set down for now.

[1:28:28] Rad_Red15: Ya ya Koe

[1:28:41] Pitchguest: Restrictions end when you get to 60

[1:28:49] jredbingo: Once I hit 60 u can grp with ppl and trade
[1:28:54] WindblowBJJ: 60 can trade with 60
[1:28:57] nulvijfeenvijf: its the same thing with not being able to party but u can be in a duo or trio
[1:28:59] Qman157: just spent 20 min in the hardcore addon lua files, its so easy to modify the addon time up to show that you have had the addon running when its not.
[1:29:01] Oui_OFC: only if a duo or trio
[1:29:21] coconust1: The only down side of trading is BOTS
[1:29:22] EliBourne: ok but wasnt the hard mode purpose to level up to 60 ?
[1:29:27] spliffz92: because its hardcore
[1:29:28] Kushdoobies420: it wouldnt be hardcore then
[1:29:37] jredbingo: Swift once you are 60 you can trade and group
[1:29:38] gfan11: seems dumb to not trade in dungeons ... y woud you want your healre dying if you could prevent it with something
[1:29:51] Pitchguest: Xar's about to hit 60
[1:29:53] NoManele: Xaruy about to ding 60
[1:29:55] Dann_Oh: Have you checked the achievement tab when you load up the hard-core addon? That is really hard
[1:29:59] Shalyon: xaryu is about to ding 60
[1:30:10] Vadagar1: That would be Semi-Hardcore and they want real Hardcore.

[1:30:22] jredbingo: @swifty once 60 u can trade and grp with others

[5:41:14] wagyu_88: @Swifty  HAHAHA do you remember the tom cruis bladestorm video
[5:41:20] 92mute: the fact that people can grief in classic era hc - is what makes it popular lets be honest

[5:42:20] bythelightx: @92mute you can’t be serious griefing is easily the worst part
[5:42:21] NuclearFrisson: there's a cfg or cvar that people found in the code somewhere labeled 'hardcore'
[5:42:21] Hot_Sauce_Ross: they one hundred percent would ruin it by allowing you to buy new life in micro transactions
[5:42:21] jecht2020: may 13th they will announce it

[5:42:36] reformedna: Usually when there are leaks and then videos are made, 99 percent of the time it ends up releasing officially at some point.
[5:42:39] natezer0: Classic WoW has like 2 devs lol, there is no way they make the changes to do it without needing an appeal system.
[5:42:39] darkpatron90: im not sure maybe the community hc is better
[5:42:45] Weemancod: trolls on HC will be everywhere. Blizz will do nothing

[5:43:05] metaphysicalwizard: no.
[5:43:06] sirnosferatualucard: please NO
[5:43:06] wagyu_88: I dont really care about hardcore. id rather have fresh classic servers with minor changes to classes
[5:43:06] rockout80: That's not HC
[5:43:07] WowGrl: Then it's not hardcore
[5:43:11] bluff1n: lol there's no way

[5:43:13] Endurestone: naww, it will make hardcore, not hardcore
[5:43:16] Blacktmagic: Would need to be $100 per rez
[5:43:17] cews7: Don't ruin my game blizz
[5:43:17] xAce101x: just like an arcade game then
[5:43:18] fourseti1234: quick! put in more quarters!
[5:43:19] brandyn231: making the work worth it
[5:43:19] profitparadox: give you a certain amount of lives per raid - per week or something..
[5:43:20] nativefig: Price doubles every time you do it LUL
[5:43:21] Cowardpatty: Back in my day, an extra life was only 25 cents
[5:43:24] Kriddius_: 43k people watching WoW on Twitch right now and 28k of them are hardcore channels. We're getting official HC servers because that's where the public interest clearly is
[5:43:25] metaphysicalwizard: just dont dc
[5:43:26] Orbion666: Whats the point in that
[5:43:27] jecht2020: too bad we go agane
[5:43:27] 92mute: @rFreeze But its the funniest part watching people get griefed lets be honest (i dont play hc so dont think i do it please lol)
[5:43:29] cews7: GM appeal then
[5:43:29] sirnosferatualucard: but that's what appeals aare fore
[5:43:30] xAce101x: quarter buys you a knew life
[5:43:37] reformedna: i just dont know if they would release a SoM 2 as well as hardcore.
[5:43:39] HughHefner01: it looses all of the hardcore feelin
[5:43:39] XaturesRTB: 5 Bugs exta Ress Swifty Just Run It Down And Go Go Agian BigBrother
[5:43:43] Gorgok_tv: fall to your death on a fp, happened to me during classic in 2019
[5:43:46] Endurestone: butttt! someone can sacifice his life for someone (has to be the same level)
[5:43:51] jecht2020: If you DC and die on Diablo 2 hardcore they wont appeal it
[5:43:55] NuclearFrisson: buying lives would kill hardcore before it even launches
[5:43:55] z0mbiesauri0: so whats the goal after getting to 60?
[5:43:55] jecht2020: make it no different
[5:43:55] xichell: those people that sell accounts are going to  make money selling HC lvl'd character accounts
[5:43:57] DrPhilLIVE: @Swifty WoW PVP, favorite expansion for PVP, and why do you think its MoP? :D
[5:43:59] Troy_G_94: With official hardcore auction house, trading, multiple dungeon runs etc will all be allowed...that kills classic hardcore for me takes away alot of the enjoyment
[5:44:06] Orbion666: Just like d2
[5:44:07] darkpatron90: its not gonna work out the community hc is fine
[5:44:08] ZinQRP: They will treat it like D2 and D3 hardcore, if you dc, you die, no appeals. Sucks to suck
[5:44:11] profitparadox: What about raids?
[5:44:14] jecht2020: nope
[5:44:17] jecht2020: just gotta delete
[5:44:18] bythelightx: @92mute I just disagree if you think it’s funny I don’t think you’re considering the time the person who got griefed spent
[5:44:19] bluff1n: if u die ur dead
[5:44:20] budaii02: d hc you die you die
[5:44:23] Orbion666: No
[5:44:24] sirnosferatualucard: nop, you die no matter reason, game over
[5:44:28] essadis: right, no mercy for diablo hardcore. never
[5:44:29] k4zmos: they can let mods from the community get involved
[5:44:29] Stalefos: human
[5:44:33] procxyofc: appeals are already dumb in the first place
[5:44:33] jecht2020: yeah thats it
[5:44:34] axellent_x: but diablo 3 every class has a cheat death
[5:44:38] gameradio: You have to buy the game again
[5:44:43] Kuushie1: By the time they release HC classic everyone will be over it already
[5:44:47] jviray__: so your telling me I can get ready to pull my ethernet plug if I think the group is going to wipe during a boss encounter Kappa
[5:44:52] whiskyrbl: What are the best HC professions for Warrior would you say?
[5:45:00] profitparadox: How would they manage raids? ... 1 wipe.. 40 people gone? Or do you think they would allow peope like 1 life per week at raid
[5:45:00] essadis: but diablo hc has been a thing for several titles
[5:45:05] jecht2020: they do on diablo 2 aswell hardcore PKers is a big thing
[5:45:06] 1njectionz: @Swifty  did u die? what level u make it too

[5:55:56] Vaerynbrah: it's outclassed by the SM quest axe, getting it on HC isn't something to be done early
[5:55:58] Troy_G_94: If you get axe at 30 you need to delete...coz you asked for help 😂😂
[5:56:14] fourseti1234: =( if we get the WW axe with help . then whats the point of HC?
[5:56:28] PiDy4: @Swifty it’s not worth, as 38 u can get the scarlet monastery axe which is better.. the war quest is only doable as 36 so for 2 lvls that grind is def. Not worth
[5:56:44] Macosqt: the quest for the quest is worth the exp tho

[7:43:32] stapradio: @swifty i still remember when that 10k dollar computer was built for you, a very epic moment. if you responded to this, i missed the response due to advertisements.
[7:43:35] budaii02: great content tho

[7:44:14] Modhnal: 1-20 is rough without class tools to escape

[7:46:20] HughHefner01: @Cowardpatty  I had the same issue earlier if you can see my history
[7:46:31] xMik9: It is adviced that you stick to 2-Handed weapons as much as possible whatever the talents specialization to avoid the dreadful hit penalty that comes with Dual Wielding, which is -19% chance to hit against a same level mob
