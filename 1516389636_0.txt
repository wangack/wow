[0:03:59] Sielu11628: Here
[0:04:55] Herzenliegen: Mmmm wrath music. I still have that cd from the expansion pack,lol
[0:08:01] Sielu11628: Tis‚Äô gonna be a great new few weeks.
[0:08:15] Sielu11628: Next*
[0:12:21] qwanTTV: What‚Äôs wotl
[0:12:35] qwanTTV: Wotlk
[0:12:48] Crakila: Wrath of the Lich King.
[0:13:13] Herzenliegen: An earlier Wow expansion
[0:13:22] FerociouzMonk: oh boy.
[0:13:25] qwanTTV: Isn‚Äôt that old?
[0:13:52] BionicMagician: AngelThump
[0:14:46] Sielu11628: Old is the new ‚Äúnew‚Äù.
[0:15:27] Sielu11628: I‚Äôm so thankful for Classic WoW. Has been a blessing during SL.
[0:15:59] Herzenliegen: @Sielu11628 indeed it has
[0:16:14] TheUnknowing: cant wait to lose my life to wrath again
[0:17:58] Herzenliegen: When do you think they'll be giving a release date for it?
[0:18:49] TheUnknowing: hopefully soon, probably within the next month id assume.
[0:20:57] Herzenliegen: I still remember the game stop party for the midnight release of this expansion and tbc
[0:23:53] Zettabyte: Good morning towHAMUP
[0:25:23] Herzenliegen: Morning :)
[0:25:30] Sielu11628: For perspective, TBC was announced late February, Beta started late March. TBC release date was announced 1 months before it launched (so around May 1 date announcement and June 1 release).
[0:25:58] Sielu11628: Wrath was announced 2 months ago and beta just started.
[0:26:25] Sielu11628: My money is on August pre-patch and September release (first week).
[0:26:35] Sielu11628: Or second at latest
[0:27:59] Krasilian: !WOTLK
[0:27:59] Moobot: @Krasilian Plans for WOTLK Beta. Some simple leveling and helping Blizzard test. At first there won't be a lot of people to do content with. That will change when 80 Template comes into play. OH and I don't have Beta keys ask Panda
[0:28:29] Herzenliegen: So, have they said if they're keeping the pre patch the same as the original?
[0:28:36] Thoreya: Morning gang
[0:29:53] Sielu11628: @herzenliegen as in time it lasted or the content?
[0:31:31] Herzenliegen: The content
[0:32:12] MistyValkyrie: @Sielu11628 i mean they said there is a xp buff coming in the upcoming weeks last week and they did said it will last 6 - 8 weeks and i believe this happens during prepatch so i'm not sure if it could be a September release
[0:33:20] Connectus: Heya
[0:33:29] Sielu11628: @chosenvalk agree with everything you just said. However, TBC beta was around 2 months total (in terms of start and TBC launch) which would put Wrath around September. Also, server consolidation is August 9 which would be a perfect time to set up pre-patch.
[0:33:57] Sielu11628: Should start 50% buff asap imo.

[0:35:12] Sielu11628: I‚Äôm so happy Wrath is coming before Dragonflight because no matter when DF launches, Wrath will tie me over.
[0:35:44] Sielu11628: I enjoyed TBC but ready to move on

[0:55:08] Motivess: @towelliee are the Amazon side bar ads a new way to do ads?  if so I much prefer that.
[0:55:16] Connectus: In WotLK DK could tank/dps in all specs
[0:55:22] Jewishraver: frost tanking is where its at
[0:55:25] Connectus: There wasn't a dedicated tank spec, some were better yes
[0:55:26] Skars111: DragonFlight Alpha announce tomorrow? 10.0 was added thismorning haha
[0:55:39] Motivess: blood is best tank in 3.3.5 wrath
[0:55:47] Connectus: @Motivess this
[0:55:49] Eithos87: @Towelliee how was the casino?
[0:55:51] ShadoodHD: frost USED to be a tank spec but we had too much fun being blood dps, hence the change Madge

[0:56:20] Jewishraver: blood dps was pretty cray lol
[0:57:01] Connectus: @Jewishraver it was at launch, was my raid spec back then MingLee
[0:57:07] tronbadgames: think pvp also pushed the spec paths
[0:57:08] Connectus: 3.3.5 blood dps is pretty much nerfed to the ground
[0:57:10] wEiRdO_dUdE: Yeah, blood became the meta but any spec was able to tank pretty good in its own way
[0:57:18] L4nds1ide: @towelliee welcome back bud we missed you
[0:57:21] vonblue: i remeber being blood dps for raids back in the day
[0:57:34] Skars111: love your expansion Hype @Towelliee can't wait for DF!
[0:57:37] Jewishraver: i frost tanked ICC

[0:57:46] Connectus: @Jewishraver same
[0:58:00] Meliea_EU: is there a date for wotlk classic going live?
[0:58:04] onous_: you could tank as frost.
[0:58:11] ExigentMidnight: Blood also had the ridiculous stacking healing buff for DPS at the start of the xpac
[0:58:12] Connectus: Also dpsed as frost MingLee
[0:58:21] wEiRdO_dUdE: In general, healing the hell out of yourself is just handy for being a tank
[0:58:22] Connectus: I remember at launch ppl always discussed what the tank spec was, I was frost dps though MingLee
[0:58:35] Motivess: it's that new class sheen
[0:58:53] Caedranos: That was the best spec setup in wotlk, miss the old death knight blood tank in ICC

[1:14:28] Harch: no
[1:14:29] dalaraz: @eXecuteFX you can either continue,or start on the fresh servers
[1:14:30] HopeThePriest: aura
[1:14:32] Klutar: passive
[1:14:35] wEiRdO_dUdE: Those damage buffs are a big reason why blood became meta too, along with the self-heals
[1:14:39] Lawdito007: ora
[1:14:51] Jewishraver: @eXecuteFX you have 2 choices, keep going on that same server that has 40-50 or start on a fresh start server and have 0 chars and start at lvl 1

[1:15:49] Motivess: lol, ok, achievements, holiday events each month, professions, alts, different ways of making money, helping guildies or friends, making friends through random activities, running dungeons for badges for BoEs and heirlooms to name a few @dalaraz
[1:15:53] wEiRdO_dUdE: We love death strike
[1:16:25] dalaraz: @Motivess 90% of those are done after a month,believe me,some of them are kinda off for me also
[1:16:27] Thoreya: @Motivess no heirlooms in classic wrath

[1:18:00] RunningOutOfRAM: we done goofed up :D
[1:18:16] dalaraz: @Motivess alts aint content,but thats my opinion,replaying things adds nothing for me,profesisons will be over in a week

[1:18:22] Klutar: need to level lol
[1:18:24] chubahi: must be lvl 80 i think so u get em all :P
[1:18:28] Thoreya: @Motivess nope
[1:18:28] netcat981: its kinda meh they changed lfd
[1:18:37] H4dus: when WOTLK  first launched Blood and Unholy were the DPS specs. Blood was far and away better
[1:19:16] Trkz22: @dalaraz Sorta, if you do alts with different classes/races you play that story so it has some value till endgame sorta
[1:19:25] wEiRdO_dUdE: Blood is about physical damage, when you get armor pen it takes off big time
[1:19:28] dalaraz: @Motivess i also talked about progress content,not side content so that might be our different pov

[1:19:41] Sdeje: Disease-less Blood was a fun DPS spec in Naxx
[1:19:45] Rudric_Ice: can we get BDK as dps in DF :)
[1:19:55] dalaraz: @Trkz22 true,but only if you never played wotlk right ?
[1:20:02] Motivess: @dalaraz do you not use professions to make money?  and how are alts not new content?  you have plenty of areas to quest you haven't. and saying replaying content isn't content is stupid when you're playing classic....
[1:20:04] Klutar: yeah and you need to balance runes
[1:20:19] 210Crawler: towHAMUP towBleedpurple towHAMUP
[1:20:22] wraaith: dont u heart strike

[1:21:19] dalaraz: @Motivess i see it the opposite,since its classic i see no reason to play alts to redo things,i already played wotlk when it was live,so everything is known to me.plus i have 4 70's ready with profesisons cause i played p1-2 tbc
[1:21:27] dalaraz: @Motivess
[1:21:35] dalaraz: i get your points though,dont get me wrong
[1:21:43] wEiRdO_dUdE: There was an issue with death runes in the beta, I remember seeing it
[1:21:49] Trkz22: @dalaraz i'll be hoenst thought you meant retail. What I mean is you start and level and end up at a different zone and due to the leveling you cant really level through all of them unless you get overgeard
[1:22:10] Klutar: blood tap

[1:22:40] dalaraz: @Trkz22 na i just said that wotlk is all about raidlogin after a month and we see it differently,nothing insane
[1:22:43] chubahi: i think it was just for aoe treath

[1:24:53] chubahi: didnt frost aura give more treath ?
[1:24:58] wraaith: blood stance for dps frost for tank unholy is basicly crusader aura
[1:25:02] Chrysopoeia: yeah u are frost
[1:25:08] Chrysopoeia: gives defensive stats
[1:25:12] dalaraz: @Trkz22 it has some great questlines if you are into lore yeah
[1:25:13] wEiRdO_dUdE: Basically you can go into blood presence until you are going to get whacked hard, then frost presence

[1:50:15] portend: The glory days more or less.
[1:50:26] mowi1007: !WOTLK
[1:50:26] Moobot: @Elauric Plans for WOTLK Beta. Some simple leveling and helping Blizzard test. At first there won't be a lot of people to do content with. That will change when 80 Template comes into play. OH and I don't have Beta keys ask Panda
[1:50:28] Motivess: I prefer LFD too sadge
[1:50:31] cajunw33dh3ad: How would you feel if DF alpha dropped today?
[1:50:39] wEiRdO_dUdE: Almost 4 months
[1:50:39] sheerheartattackyk: don't know how they will do with the daily badge reward using the finder
[1:50:45] Niksen_99: Towel whats a good pet for survival hunter in m+ ?
[1:50:54] cajunw33dh3ad: I‚Äôm sure it won‚Äôt though
[1:51:12] portend: That tower always fucked with my head in the beginning
[1:51:18] RerouteToHell: @sheerheartattackyk automatic quest when you enter first dungeon?
[1:51:23] RerouteToHell: or daily somewhere
[1:51:35] wraaith: dk has bug atm for all f[s
[1:51:42] wEiRdO_dUdE: This is a beta thing, I bet
[1:51:46] Ramdorpser: known bug
[1:51:46] dalaraz: its just beta error prolly
[1:51:48] KaisenSiru: YEP
[1:51:51] king_julian_96: how long has the wrath beta been out for now
[1:51:55] AmaterasuS: templates have it copied characters don't

[1:52:02] Tjc222: I hope Wrath comes out before Brewfest because I want both of the stam trinkets from the event.

[1:52:14] mewkittymon: Yip because your mane did it

[1:52:43] Korupcija_: stop fp? in my wrath classic? üò°
[1:53:02] Connectus: Daily badges came from a daily quest pre-LFD
[1:53:05] Tjc222: The daily badge will just be a daily quest that they before the RFD came in.
[1:53:08] Connectus: so they'll just bring back the daily quest
[1:53:09] Sleepylol93: Wished they would bring cross faction to wotlk too
[1:53:12] sprert: before the df there was a daily quest in dalaran
[1:53:15] Motivess: daily is a quest next to violet hold
[1:53:20] Gunfluster: it used to be a badge quest outside the dalaran dungeon at the beggining of wrath wasnt it ?
[1:53:24] dalaraz: its not about timelost,its just so you dont go to the empty tents :p
[1:53:30] sheerheartattackyk: and probably you are gonna see all the sellers spamming "selling time lost proto drake spawn" thingy
[1:53:38] AmaterasuS: did you fly to ice crown? cause some FPs in ice crown unlock after you do quests to phase them and before they have hostile mobs around them
[1:53:42] Motivess: but they gave an extra 2 every dungeon with rdf though

[1:56:54] Niksen_99: blizzard should pay you. you are the reason i pre order Dragonflight
[1:56:58] Dyriks: I'm aware, and I remember how toxic the community was so I am probably not going to check out the pvp in overwatch again

[2:24:23] Antaury91: Death Coil
[2:24:26] actually_pierce: Is frost DK dual weild only or can you use a two handed weapon? I've never played it and I was considering it, but I prefer to use one big weapon
[2:24:27] flebbooo: Death coil
[2:24:27] Scoodles91: frost strike
[2:24:34] blastbust: some abilities not bound? not learnt?
[2:24:35] moofia1980: rune strike and death coil

[2:24:39] andymonkaS: @Towelliee When do you think they're gonna announce WOTLK release date? Seems kinda weird they haven't give any hints on release dates and we're due 2 expansions in 6 months!
[2:24:40] Subparferal: @actually_pierce you can use both
[2:24:46] moofia1980: ohh yeah frost strike
[2:24:46] sheerheartattackyk: death strike uses runic i believe
[2:24:48] ExoduzOG: @Towelliee I've been meaning to ask this since beta came out, but is there a way you can move ur cam up a lil bit to uncover all the abilities? :)
[2:24:48] nocturnal_2195: @itbrigadeyo yeah, you need to be a sub or get permission  to link

[2:25:57] Xoyzor: was blood a dps back then?
[2:26:09] Motivess: in 3.0 yes
[2:26:15] Clicklesly: All DK specs were either dps or tank iirc

[2:26:54] Shearkahn: Frost strike in the talent tree?
[2:26:58] Niksen_99: Is legendaries 100% drop chance now ?
[2:27:02] Decree34: unholy tanking was so OP
[2:27:05] gundamzeros01: @Towelliee frost strike on Frost talent , for blood heart strike if not mistaken
[2:27:08] BoezIRL: frost strike is the other
[2:27:35] Motivess: @niksen_99 huh?  legendaries?
[2:27:37] OMEGOSS: Yeah unholy tank was something else, especially when they got geared
[2:27:38] Sphafer: Then use death coil.
[2:27:47] flebbooo: i think with this build u probably just dump runic power on Death coil, but not too sure
[2:28:13] sheerheartattackyk: death coil and death strike probably the last one uses runic also
[2:28:23] mukulukku: I thought Death Strike was the runic power spender
[2:28:25] Xoyzor: why do you have a pet other than a ghoul?
[2:28:25] moofia1980: use pestilence to spread diseases
[2:28:53] Storm_Taker: Hello all
[2:28:59] Etsku: DUUUUUDUDUUE i miss old death knights
[2:29:07] Ragnarage95: Frost was the tank back then right towelliiee?
[2:29:30] DenTza: I actually loved it back in WOTLK. It was my main, until I switched to resto druid
[2:29:36] Etsku: i started playing wow in woltk and always played a dk to shadowlands
[2:29:42] Samaellus: yes @Ragnarage95
[2:30:03] moofia1980: can you link the guide you use ?
[2:30:04] mondegooo: @Ragnarage95 guess blood was
[2:30:12] blastbust: AngelThump
[2:30:30] RagingPunk: i think originaly dk was so strong they can tank on any of the specs lol
[2:31:33] diaperman42069: how come no obliterate @Towelliee ? I remember that being a blast in wrath
[2:31:35] Towelliee: http://forum.warmane.com/showthread.php?t=349830
[2:31:38] Dystilled: I played a DK as my 2nd in WOTLK, they were absolutely broken. Could definitely tank in any spec, just one was better
[2:31:44] PadidinJones: @Towelliee truth is unholy was the shit for DPS. I remember topping dps meters in every raid with my guild.
[2:31:50] moofia1980: Thanks
[2:32:15] gundamzeros01: mybe its on certain Wotlk patches
[2:32:19] Rudric_Ice: im just gonna pvp with DK and prolly raid then im done with wrath
[2:32:38] diaperman42069: might not have enough diseases yet
[2:32:49] gundamzeros01: trrue
[2:33:06] diaperman42069: cause oblit does more damage with more diseases
[2:33:09] Dystilled: Early DK was the classic split talent tree where you didnt have to spec to final talent in anything
[2:33:30] Subparferal: they gonna use old wotlk models or legion ones for chars? like in warmane
[2:33:40] Armdel: i do miss the old way they displayed the floating combat text
[2:33:49] Klutar: howling fjord such a nice zone
[2:34:02] diaperman42069: oh I see, sorry I jumped in late I didnt know you were goin for a blood build
[2:34:13] taintalizerx: wow youre just shredding those mobs
[2:34:20] PadidinJones: Are you specing into Unholy at all? I think you used to boost your diseases in that tree somewhere
[2:34:21] Rudric_Ice: @Armdel u can still get that with an addon
[2:34:39] Etsku: dks always survive
[2:34:47] Dystilled: Tank spec grinding in WOTLK was OP
[2:35:27] Dystilled: Tank spec levelling was 100% a thing in old WOTLK though. Great survivability vs packs
[2:35:48] PadidinJones: @Towelliee that is true. I think I did blood for leveling then unholy for lvl 80 gameplay and pvp
[2:35:53] shottishotti: On the ships
[2:35:58] Roddox123: castsequence icytouch,plague strike, bS,BS, obliterate repeat. worked for me in early wrath.

[2:39:28] Motivess: wrath beta > SL
[2:39:38] emznev: is prot paladin super fun in wrath?
[2:39:48] grylz89: I barely played wotlk so it'll be a new journey
[2:40:02] diaperman42069: is wrath dropping at the same time as DF?
[2:40:12] RagingPunk: yea man wrath is gona be great
[2:40:21] grylz89: nah wotlk will drop 3-4 months before
[2:40:22] Fovigo: @Badkizz Not allways, i think most of the times if not all u go two hand blood, but theres also a frost tank spec for early gear
[2:40:25] Motivess: warrior is for me
[2:40:27] grylz89: dragon world
[2:40:28] romere_db: WotLK Pally was AMAZING
[2:40:31] Tjc222: Warrior is super fun but, apparently they are not as great as the other tanks.

[2:41:06] TerrClau: prot warr in bg's oh boi

[2:41:16] 210Crawler: I agree. Divine Plea was a game changer
[2:41:16] wizlordherbie: Warrior hasn't been as good as other tanks the moment a 2nd tank was  added to the game
[2:41:20] Fovigo: Block is not a good mechanic, so warriors get a lot of dmg :(
[2:41:21] grylz89: prot warrior is busted , damn good dmg
[2:41:25] diaperman42069: warrior was a sick tank once they got gear from nax. But doing nax was hard

[2:47:22] PToastman: I always consider howling fjord to be a horde zone for some reason
[2:47:31] jerexify: OK, we don't have to try and explain Towelliee's actions like he's your closest personal friend. We get it, he doesn't stream non-game time. Thank you.
[2:47:35] ZeusDNA: @rathmanis Casinos tend to not allow you to even take video/pictures on the floor so streaming would get you booted pretty quick
[2:47:42] diaperman42069: is group loot not in wrath?
[2:47:45] mmo_kenna_: 1/3 of his 1k spent was dono, rest was his money

[2:56:14] Nuclayer: @Motivess im sure i did, had 3 toons. probably just didnt pay attention bck then
[2:56:21] vulkankragon: i am concerned that the quest markers will not be there in the final release. recently they are making lots of strange decisions with classic.
[2:56:22] Rudric_Ice: gargoyles are cooler than dragon men
[2:56:37] elizondria: they're literally based on the drake model, it's insane that people see that they aren't looking like the aspects and going like "wow this is awful :)"
[2:57:05] akia03: wont everybody just use addons for quests anyway
[2:57:41] Nico_vdM: Are we going to revive Questhelper for Wrath classic?

[3:01:27] Inzidious: its a glyph right?
[3:01:28] Shearkahn: I think they got rid of that because of arenas
[3:01:34] miriones: i think only unholy does that
[3:01:43] Motivess: yea, that was like 3.0 dk
[3:01:44] sifer007: naxx out yet? PogChamp
[3:01:51] Motivess: it got removed iirc

[3:03:02] spencernpp: I can still go to northrend at lvl 68 right?

[3:05:04] Nico_vdM: The one bad thing about DKs that I remember was that everyone LOVED death grip. As a tank I hated it - yoink my mob now!

[3:05:35] 210Crawler: Yeah, when did AoE loot get implemented

[3:28:45] Billo0w: @Shearkahn you dont, they already said that, everyone can make a dk as far as im aware
[3:28:47] Atrionix: hello helloooo
[3:28:53] iRage1776: @Towelliee I played shaman as my main in Wrath, but if I did it again, id probably play Pally
[3:29:11] Motivess: you need a 55 on the fresh server to make a dk
[3:29:19] Gizimoo86: i think fresh leveling could be fun, lots of low level dungeons etc.
[3:29:20] racketpunch: Are you doing a pvp or pve fresh server?
[3:29:28] Potato_Nation19: @Towelliee Im glad they are consolidating some servers. I just came back to TBC to get ready and I think I've only seen 2-3 other people the whole time
[3:29:29] Shearkahn: @Billo0w Death Knights cannot be created on these realms without a level 55 character on that same realm.
[3:29:35] ThatManDill: No need for 55 at all
[3:29:44] Mecabeast: dont you need a 60 on the server to make a dk or is it just a 60 on any server
[3:29:57] Motivess: @thatmandill on fresh you do
[3:29:59] lawrenceb: On fresh you‚Äôll need a 55 first
[3:30:15] Jarless: 55 1st
[3:30:15] ThatManDill: Oh really damn lol

[3:30:38] Chumbimboo: yea they did
[3:30:43] EpicBananners: DKs will have a crazy advantage then
[3:30:47] stratiss: without having a 55
[3:30:49] Gizimoo86: wow dk going to be really good then, big headstart to get max lvl and gear

[3:34:10] DemonicWarfare: my dk name is Flowersbane
[3:34:14] PadidinJones: Holy pallys? hmmm then you miss out on a 1h opportunity
[3:34:21] drunkhog: Did you have to lvl the dk from 55 or did it start at 70?
[3:34:24] Bernardo994: i miss these days, switching presence at will
[3:34:30] ThatManDill: Yes frost

[3:36:12] Korupcija_: I'm sad DF wont have that new cool class spell like wrath did(chaos bolt, divine storm, titan's grip etc.)
[3:36:16] nocturnal_2195: @drunkgoats my bad wasn't sure
[3:36:24] Billo0w: @Shearkahn BLUE POST: Available to both factions and starting at level 55, Death Knights‚ÄîWorld of Warcraft‚Äôs first hero class‚Äîharness the powers of darkness to help combat the evil that threatens Azeroth. While Death Knights are limited to one per server and require a level 55 character on that server to create, in Wrath Classic, we will be bypassing that requirement for a player‚Äôs first Death Knight.

[3:45:45] ThatManDill: Frost press increases armor value and threat
[3:45:53] Epixil: 10 copper
[3:45:53] sve7k0: blue one is for tanking, blood is pve dps and the unholy is for pvp mostly @everyone

[4:22:26] j_bar111: can you preload OW2?
[4:22:33] Motivess: I enjoy his react content more than most gameplay @memnon94
[4:22:46] ZiggyJZ_: @SpenceSir Draenor is super fast if you can fly in that zone.
[4:22:48] kashox: is there a link to what the skin looks like somehwere or who is the skin for?
[4:22:49] Kinghorn: what do you think about FFXIV requiring 4 gifted subs for a mount NaBNez
[4:22:52] Kinghorn: curious
[4:22:55] Frank4LuLz: asmon streams are just weak now
[4:23:04] Motivess: ff14 is boring to watch personally
[4:23:12] SpenceSir: @SpenceSir Thanks, Im leveling from 10 so cant fly

[4:23:33] cripplious: what class are you using?
[4:23:35] chrslp: This may be an unpopular opinion but I really dont find xqc entertaining LUL
[4:23:48] Motivess: me either
[4:23:52] NaBNez: @Kinghorn thats crazy honestly...i dont play ff so idk much about it but its predatory af
[4:23:55] SilkeySmooth: its just streamers riding hype games
[4:23:57] Motivess: @chrslp
[4:23:58] Ramdorpser: @chrslp I think it just depends on your age tbh, you're probably over 28?
[4:24:03] Parkway1088: @Towelliee any insight when the WotLK pre order will start?
[4:24:13] 3dRes: @chrslp not unpopular at all dayCool
[4:24:16] chrslp: @Ramdorpser Yea LUL

[4:25:04] Kriven: @Kinghorn i mean how so the game is free for pvp. Cosmetics is how money is made and it going to a streamer for a way to promo the game seems fine to me
[4:25:12] Kisswani: arthas statue # 7 POGGERS ?
[4:25:12] memnon94: Hots is so good, I'm so sad it's basically dead, hope Microsoft is planning to revive it

[4:29:36] Rexialiton: Which I think is a great way to do
[4:29:41] belaham: Rather give it to a streamer. Blizzard already gets enough of my money lol
[4:29:42] Lonely_piggy_: 20$+ for a skin is pretty expensive, especially for the Brigitte one which -- to be real -- doesn't look good at all lol
[4:29:48] NaBNez: you end up paying 15$ for something which should be free
[4:29:56] Ebo1337_PBP: @Towelliee are they letting you unholy tank or is Blood already set as tank spec
[4:29:58] Sollice: Does the OW 2 beta just show up on BNET launcher?
[4:30:06] Cootiin: It worked the same way on warmane as well, thats why we were kinda surprised it worked the same way on beta
[4:30:07] haderdaraide: people complain to just complain lol, its crazy
[4:30:08] Shearkahn: The sweeping strikes revenge build?   its CRAZY
[4:30:09] mpmicke: prot warr can ez pull 10k dps due to the spec they go xD
[4:30:09] haderdaraide: just play the game
[4:30:09] Kinghorn: it is mostly an arms spec to get 1 second revenges
[4:30:16] Kinghorn: and sweeping strikes
[4:30:56] Motivess: man, having no one to compete with on these quests would be so nice
[4:30:58] rosina_scarlett: @Ebo1337 any dk spec can tank in Wrath
[4:31:07] belaham: shield maiden is best skin for her imo
[4:31:21] dudeimunknown: How tf Can you already be lvl 70???
[4:31:22] Rudric_Ice: WoW players will riot if blizzard did this with WoW
[4:31:33] rosina_scarlett: Live servers up Towelliee

[4:59:50] grogero73: GOd, i kinda miss Wotlk.
[4:59:51] madbombz_fth: isnt boss only on heroic?
[4:59:53] RiskyBusines_ez: its not really a boss on normal i reckon

[5:00:48] Dagomarus: i just macro my death and decay so it goes where i am standing
[5:00:49] jordanmcq78: you need to have "Show all spell ranks" checked for macros to work
[5:01:10] siiny101: i recall blood being broken
[5:01:39] Frank4LuLz: lets go

[5:03:52] notColt45: Did you see the Prot warrior solo'ing dungeons?
[5:03:55] PadidinJones: DKs dont have a brez yet right?
[5:04:20] belaham: they come back as a ghoul
[5:04:40] belaham: The ghouls actually do pretty good dps. Would only use on a boss
[5:04:45] PadidinJones: Yea thats for now. I think only in Cata or Panda they got a brez
[5:04:46] bionilo: raise ally
[5:05:02] NaBNez: at least need frames
[5:05:03] Rudric_Ice: that should come back as in DF as a talent
[5:05:16] NaBNez: healing without frames is cursed
[5:05:19] Dystilled: looks like he thinks his only heal is chain heal
[5:05:20] Austei: i mean healing is that hard without macro's our mouse overs for nomrals
[5:05:24] jordanmcq78: It works, just make sure you have "Show all spell ranks" checked in your spellbook
[5:05:26] Austei: is not that hard*
[5:05:29] CodyKane: Mouse over's should work just fine
[5:05:30] Bigmann109: I remember when you could raise ghoul in arena lol
[5:05:31] smashwow: you'd be surprised how many healers don't use mouseover macros
[5:05:33] twinkieruler95: @Towelliee is this frost tank?
[5:05:41] belaham: Hysteria is coming back in the talent tree's but not in the form it was in wrath
[5:06:11] TheCliffyShow: Don't icey touch to many people. Might get sued.
[5:06:29] TheCliffyShow: Show us on the doll where the Death Knight icy touched you.
[5:06:31] Rudric_Ice: the DK class discord channel is pissed with the DK talent trees
[5:06:40] Voramir: I miss frost tank, I remember I got kicked from a group after frost was switched to the dps spec because they thought it was tank spec
[5:07:08] CaarrotTop: what was the better dps dk spec? blood?
[5:07:25] Dystilled: From memory it was Blood/UH hybrid tree

[5:07:54] Saucetonia: it can be hard to see what its actually hitting too

[5:08:40] Dystilled: Our MT used to go full frost for survivability, and I OTd as UH/Blood because its DPS was insane but could step in if he went down
[5:08:53] NieIas: they have 30k ppl online now
[5:09:17] Lokajin: Its also adapted to how badly or overly generous the skill scripting is on the server. warmane has some questionable design decisions around skills and how they interact so alot of builds exploit those mechanics.
[5:09:19] Niksen_99: I think those numbers are fake
[5:09:20] Pumani: when will wotlk classic be released?
[5:09:49] Ventian_Lane: @towelliee can you 2H weapon frost tank in wotlk classic?
[5:09:50] Saucetonia: probably like august
[5:10:15] im_n0t_jezus: miss thye old eath an ddecay
[5:10:30] NieIas: warmane
[5:10:32] c0mmander_starscream: Wrath classic will be released befor AoC
[5:10:39] Kinghorn: healer jumped in the hole lmao
[5:11:00] Kinghorn: oldest trick in the nexus
[5:11:06] RiskyBusines_ez: do you just spam everything and use DS on cd, fill with runestrike?
[5:11:07] silodin: Warmane probably lies about that. i remember someone explaining how they would have a financial incentive to do so
[5:11:07] Austei: another one
[5:11:14] Playsmartyr: classc
[5:11:19] Atem___: someone always finds the hole lol
[5:11:31] c0mmander_starscream: Wrong hole
[5:11:43] uere_ttv: hey towellie, do u know if race change will be able when wotlk release?
[5:11:43] Atem___: The dungeon designer who made that hole deserves the biggest raise lol
[5:11:47] Gulducky: Is this on a wow server or a private server?
[5:11:52] TheCliffyShow: But, Nexus is a blue dragon dungeon not Scourge.
[5:11:53] Niksen_99: Yeah warmane got a store on their website.. so they lie about their numbers saying 30k people are playing to make it look good
[5:11:59] Saucetonia: lmao
[5:12:03] Kinghorn: LUL
[5:12:08] madbombz_fth: can you link it ? @Towelliee

[5:12:58] gritbarontv: unholy for the bone shield, i think
[5:13:28] akia03: didnt that change in the last part of wotlk making blood the tank spec?

[5:13:31] shifferbrains562: Pretty much. Blood was just unkillable so it became the default tank spec by Blizzard. And anything they lost they healed back up to super easy through DS.
[5:13:42] Dystilled: yeah, a lot of it was personal preference, or dependent on progression fights. My MT and I would occassionally run the same spec but different end tree talents
[5:13:57] Niksen_99: Same in with the hole in Wailing Caverns lol always 1 guy that fails the jump
[5:14:01] Kinghorn: snackybox the king of RP
[5:14:06] Kinghorn: m'lord
[5:14:37] Dystilled: These are the moments you wish you had Jumper Cables
[5:14:38] Genius_Kappa: Only Wotlk Dungeons you can see the maps. Not classic or BC ones
[5:14:39] shifferbrains562: Sucked though because I played Blood DPS from launch night until they took it away in pre-patch. it was such a fun spec and played up the fantasy of unkillable knight.
[5:14:41] chefjayare: wrath was the first time we got maps
[5:14:42] bionilo: yep
[5:14:44] Kinghorn: you can see the shaman running through the maze in real time!
[5:14:44] Saisino: Maps came late WOTLK, no?
[5:14:55] esduewow: maps for dungeons came in late wotlk
[5:15:01] Kinghorn: I think maps for all the old dungeons were cata right
[5:15:05] Yagr6: with dragon flight pre orders and the game on the horizon i just cant get excited for wrath again
[5:15:07] chefjayare: when VOA came out i think
[5:15:11] Sunstepgg: tcg mounts were in the game in wrath I wonder if they will bring them back
[5:15:31] Deadelus0: They are doing that exactly
[5:15:33] Saisino: You mean install Quesie :D

[5:16:50] Sollice: Anyone try out that new HD texture pack for monsters and shit for FF14?

[5:42:22] rosina_scarlett: T-PAIN!
[5:42:22] mavericks312: I seen ppl complaining that there's not many legit OW streamers on the list

[6:05:16] wEiRdO_dUdE: Forcing us to use addons.... ugh
[6:05:18] abracka_: IMO, one of the best things about wrath was the casual aspect it brought into the game coming from vanilla/tbc. they're removing everything that made it so popular

[6:14:32] blapster: How did he pull up a group finder in classic? Is that an addon?
[6:14:33] MrGharr: RDF for leveling was awesome, they should enable it for alts if you already leveled a main to max.
[6:14:38] mavericks312: @xolowlifetwo until players meta slave it
[6:14:43] Thoreya: ^ but some people actually dont want the finder
[6:14:50] Thoreya: so its not necessarily that they dont listen
[6:15:00] ChiliMoMilli: @MrGharr 100% agree. THats what they should do
[6:15:04] falldrgn: if they don't want it and its in the game.. don't use it?

[6:22:58] Niksen_99: If you keep all those casuals loved (which they can play in shadowlands btw) how many players from bc will play wrath you think? @Maydie6066
[6:23:01] nisuunlite: @mavericks312 i get that, but id argue the majority of the players who are interested in playing wrath are not very casual
[6:23:08] evnaae: I've been thinking about re-doing my enitre front and back yard but Idk if I wanna pay 10k to get it all done up rn
[6:23:18] rosina_scarlett: use the quest item it gives you
[6:23:27] Rudric_Ice: after 5 years my paladin got banned for the name assbringer PepeHands
[6:23:30] Dalinaar: I got Beta fever so bad. All I want to do is practice Disc Priest.
[6:23:39] mavericks312: @litflip I would argue that's incorrect you have casuals who didn't like bc or vanilla and were waiting for wrath itself
[6:23:40] ottavianni: keep my wife name out of your mouth
[6:23:40] CritcobainTV: Look at this idiot Bjorn Halgurdsson. Jebaited
[6:24:30] Maydie6066: @Niksen_99 accessibilitiy = casual? damn didn't realize that every hardcore player in wrath said fuck off to quest tracking and LFG...
[6:24:38] nisuunlite: @mavericks312 so this would mean wrath is going to have to have more than double the players than bc ?
[6:24:59] CritcobainTV: Will smith when his wifes names in someones mouth üò° Will Smith when someone else is in his wifes mouth >.>

[6:31:28] mavericks312: not many raids better then throne of thunder
[6:31:37] the_general01: could you imagine those on a legion tank
[6:31:46] Kriven: @Kenny_77 nah he just playing a vod
[6:31:52] wrec7: i loved farming the dino mounts in mop
[6:31:53] ThatTuesdayGuy: mop graphics were so sharp, loved it
[6:31:59] CritcobainTV: I took a break after cata and came back during ToT, played ele sham
[6:32:03] Kenny_77: @Kriven ok thanks
[6:32:04] lucidakamaze: lets see here, Bad talent system, Mythic raiding, LFR was brought back, extremley out of place theme, too much buttons. Throne of thunder was the only good thing about the expac
[6:32:07] Nessebr: highmaul also lit
[6:32:22] d0mezg4mer: the TBC raids did not stand the test of time
[6:32:23] mavericks312: vanilla raids are trash change my mind

[6:32:45] ArroArroArro: @mavericks312 trash now, at there time they were it
[6:32:47] Orion280: SoO had mythic ye
[6:32:49] CritcobainTV: yeah, mop was when they changed heroic to mythic
[6:32:51] rosina_scarlett: at the end MoP did
[6:32:52] TheUnknowing: they made seige mythic at the end
[6:32:52] lucidakamaze: Last raid

[6:33:36] NotMitchShelton: the "tail end" of cata so to speak
[6:33:39] BLARGO_: it was changed to mythic in name only. No rebalancing. When SoO first released its highest tier was Heroic
[6:33:50] Saphirosa_Dragonaspect: One of my fav Raids is BRF. I just like the theme

[7:19:31] dreamwalker213: @mmo_kenna_ anyone who chooses not to play wrath because of those two things didn‚Äôt care enough about it to begin with

[7:20:25] danohtv: wow classic looks so fun Kappa
[7:20:32] The_Dane_Train: Do you really think they make more money off server transfers than they would make from subs.     I know many that quit when their faction died on their server.
[7:20:37] ayoLilBlue: @TheAMProject Yessss, people will just resort to something like that again
[7:20:51] CianoHD3: @TheAMProject they are adding in the current group finder in instead of lfg
[7:21:12] alby6: i think you kill little adds and they drop the item to make them non elites
[7:21:14] egraves7: i think if you drag them on to those big red runes it weakens them or something
[7:21:25] Niksen_99: Yes because your sub is linked to your retail account @The_Dane_Train
[7:21:29] ayoLilBlue: Oh, I didn't know that actually - I think the current group finder would be okay!
[7:22:01] wEiRdO_dUdE: They keep spawning and walking north
[7:22:03] HaxzorJimDuggan: sweet, there is a ram mount for ESO on the prime gaming right now

[7:22:54] AyKasi: will there be any changes to the racials
[7:23:01] Blazzerx: WOTLK HYPE
[7:23:17] Niksen_99: Blizzard is basiaclly making it a pain in the ass to level in wrath so they can sell level boosts
[7:23:25] HaxzorJimDuggan: i ate taco bell almost every night for the first week of wotlk release
[7:23:25] Blazzerx: WoD music Kreygasm

[7:24:07] Blazzerx: leveling in wrath looks easier than in tbc or vanilla
[7:24:13] tripreality00: does wrath have the achievement that lets you see the mob youve killed the most and how many times you've killed it? is that a thing or am I not remembering correctly.
[7:24:29] wEiRdO_dUdE: good tanking practice
[7:24:32] neugassh: @Niksen_99 yep...it will be so much pain with +50% xp KEKW
[7:24:38] dreamwalker213: @niksen_99 literally nothing has changed how leveling is gonna be 1-70 is gonna be ass regardless
[7:25:09] Yagr6: this whole classic run blizzard is on is meant for classic andys right?
[7:25:14] MeauxDollaz: We've become lazier over the years as well. We like our QoL shit
[7:25:19] CianoHD3: @dreamwalker213 do they not change the xp values in 1-70?
[7:25:26] ayoLilBlue: What expansion do you think has been/was the most competitive xpack? @Towelliee
[7:25:36] thevelblade: +50% exp bonus to 1-70 during prepatch
[7:25:41] Luxembourger: @meauxdollaz thats true
[7:25:42] dreamwalker213: @cianohd3 only 60-70 is boosted. 1-60 is same as tbc
[7:26:00] CianoHD3: @dreamwalker213 rip
[7:26:02] Drizz_36: they have heirlooms in wrath though so that will make leveling faster too
[7:26:05] Niksen_99: removing LFG and quest helper = more sales in boosts @dreamwalker213 @neugassh
[7:26:18] wEiRdO_dUdE: Saved by the food!
[7:26:39] Luxembourger: When was the quest helper introduced?
[7:26:44] Luxembourger: In MoP?
[7:26:53] Kale_Nd: @Luxembourger 3.3.5
[7:26:54] CianoHD3: @Luxembourger in wrath
[7:26:57] asmodai4823: end of wrath
[7:26:58] TixesDT: Is lvl 70 boost comming with prepatch  or will it be 68 ?
[7:27:17] asmodai4823: well it wasnt there for most of wrath
[7:27:24] Luxembourger: Lol
[7:27:31] mikeygames: not using dnd?
[7:27:33] Kale_Nd: @asmodai4823 it was there for almos 50% of wrath
[7:27:33] Onisekai: L take from the devs tbh
[7:27:36] ScriptzSB: people are just gonna have addons not adding it is pointless
[7:27:36] Moobot: THE HAMMER SQUAD CROSS FACTION COMMUNITY! https://www.worldofwarcraft.com/invite/7Ypy9yXc3B3?region=US&faction=Horde | NA FOR NOW
[7:27:41] dreamwalker213: @niksen_99 99.99% of people will have questie which is better anyway. And even with LFD you‚Äôre gonna be sitting in 30 min ques because ain‚Äôt no one gonna be doing classic dungeons lol
[7:27:46] TitanFox: thank god for addons lol
[7:27:46] jepbe: It was in last patch?
[7:27:46] neugassh: only for 1 patch
[7:27:48] mavericks312: right now blizz is just screwing over the casuals
[7:27:49] chrslp: Im confused I was hearing other streamers just saying the helper in beta is bugged and not working but should be there for launch?
[7:27:51] asmodai4823: @asmodai4823 final patch
[7:27:56] dreamwalker213: To be fair, it was added at the end of wrath
[7:28:01] j_bar111: If you purchase the lvl 58 boost in TBC can you still get the 70 boost during wrath?
[7:28:10] jaws120: im scared of leaving the realm ive been on since cata; i know it might be silly but i have an attachment here. but the realm is just so... not the same anymore. any advice? @Towelliee
[7:28:11] TixesDT: @j_bar111 ofc
[7:28:21] CianoHD3: they might add it in a later patch as in the interview that mrgm posted they said they wanted it to be like the launch of wrath and it wasnt there for wrath launch
[7:28:22] chrslp: I still have my 58 boost sitting on my account unused LUL
[7:28:22] dreamwalker213: @j_bar111 separate purchase but yeah
[7:28:22] Kale_Nd: @dreamwalker213 it was added in 3.3.5 which lasted for 50% of wrath
[7:28:27] j_bar111: I have not used a boost on my account yet for TBC
[7:28:29] Yagr6: tbf who cares about old content we have already cleared
[7:28:32] Onisekai: 3.3
[7:28:55] dreamwalker213: @kale_nd the point is still valid, people are bitching over something so minor
[7:28:56] j_bar111: im tempted to buy the 58 since it currently on sale
[7:29:00] chrslp: @Towelliee Staysafe seemed pretty sure that the helper would be working at Wrath launch
[7:29:09] neugassh: @dreamwalker213 contentwise its 1/4 of wrath
[7:29:26] paradoxyy: !alpha

[7:30:46] PokerFaceMoose: they def broke it and are making an excuse
[7:30:46] Atma23: Just give people the option to turn it off or on. Making the default as off.
[7:30:48] MrGharr: private servers don't have issues
[7:30:51] Utmost777: maybe it is broken and they don't want to tell us that they can't fix it
[7:30:56] neugassh: doesn't matter either way
[7:31:00] AMOprobos227: how can you find all the bugs without it.
[7:31:18] jepbe: @MrGharr  Are you sure xd?
[7:31:20] dreamwalker213: But on the other hand, knowing what here will be questie why make such a big deal over it lol
[7:31:29] mavericks312: but instead there listening to the candies and not casuals\
[7:32:35] Kale_Nd: at this pace i wouldn't be surprised if they introduce attunement quests where there were none before
[7:32:46] TitanFox: shit got broken in cata, this is wrath please stop fucking up our game LUL
[7:32:50] Maydie6066: @dreamwalker213 because not everyone should have to develop and run addons for something that was part of the game

[7:33:01] dreamwalker213: Everyone wants LFD until half the time you get into a group people leave because they don‚Äôt want that certain dungeon and your back in a long ass que
[7:33:19] asmodai4823: thought they were only buffing nax
[7:33:26] HaxzorJimDuggan: due to the popularity of attunements we have added the requirement of completing a Immortal run of Naxx in order to enter Ulduar... have fun! Kappa
[7:33:30] KombatWombat07: inc CC for heroics again
[7:33:32] Lasidor: Occulus will always suck massive ass
[7:33:36] Snabido: Had a few mobs with deadly abilities, but easy to stop
[7:33:39] mavericks312: @dreamwalker213 wrong that usually happened with premade groups
[7:33:41] Gootecks_1989: the only dungeon people fucked up was occulus
[7:33:55] Snabido: Like that mage spider in Old Kingdom with big cast

[7:34:53] chrslp: You still liking your Mach E?
[7:34:53] dreamwalker213: @mavericks312 you literally make no sense
[7:35:33] wraaith: " bosses now only drop 1 item and content is 8months apart "
[7:35:34] Saucetonia: they could be setting themselves up to have a "classic style" cata
[7:35:36] Onisekai: What in one week? delete heirlooms? lmao
[7:35:42] mavericks312: watch they will give LK 25 attempts instead of 50 now
[7:36:27] allisonkielle: End of wrath
[7:36:29] wEiRdO_dUdE: Heirlooms were in from the start
[7:36:33] chrslp: I like how they can simply push updates for recalls now LUL
[7:36:38] Hellifyoudont66: I'm honestly really impressed that Ford's recall problems have been update fixable so far.
[7:36:43] Kriven: I wanted to grab a ford maverick hybrid as a nice lil pickup but they are so behind on them
[7:36:50] egraves7: don't you buy them with emblems at this point so you can't get the m yet?
[7:36:51] Chr1sPbacon: how long has the beta been out?

[7:37:05] stratiss: heirlooms were released in 3.2
[7:37:16] KombatWombat07: ICC music :D
[7:37:17] stratiss: and you can bet your ass they wont be in this verison
[7:37:20] Kale_Nd: heirlooms or at the start https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Heirloom#Patch_changes
[7:37:31] Kale_Nd: were*
[7:37:42] chrslp: @Kriven Whole car market is still fucked up. I like to check my cars value on Carvana and Driveway occasionally and they just offered me $7k above MSRP for my year old Mach E with 10k miles
[7:37:44] Lasidor: Not sure why they would put heirlooms in a Classic version tho?
[7:37:50] j_bar111: Can you preload OW2?
[7:37:59] Kriven: @chrslp yeah its nutty
[7:38:39] chrslp: When you take the tax credit I already claimed into account, that's essentially making $14-15k profit on a car over a year LUL
