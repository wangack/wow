[1:27:48] Bayne77: i dont think you can fatigue yourself to a different continent?
[1:27:54] ClassicMalcontent: It was all WoW, login servers, Classic, WotLK Classic, Retail all went offline. So not sure.

[1:28:25] MMokuin: @AllenzoTV nvm , belf are tbc i am confused LUL
[1:28:28] abracka_: XIV NA servers also had issues that day apparently too, could have been a ddos attack
[1:28:37] ClassicMalcontent: All things WoW went down server and login servers. Not sure what they were fixing. An exploit of some kind I assume but pehaps the security kind not in-game.
[1:28:48] TacDuc: Remember back in BfA when they had to callback the servers a bit, because Legion m+ gave BfA m+ chest

[1:37:39] zeeAbe: Because if it is monthly it will require like 28.5k subs, but if it is yearly you only need like 2400 subs per month to reach the 100k
[1:37:39] Kakotan2143: @zeeAbe my guess is life time

[1:38:12] zeeAbe: Yeah to pass the 100k with 70/30 you need only 2400 subs per month, so the impact will be quite noticeable
[1:38:18] Gingerprimer: But streamers are not employes so twitch do not care about giving you a raise.
[1:38:23] Murtorog: Murtorog converted from a Prime sub to a Tier 1 sub! 
[1:38:24] Rudric_Ice: when will they announce prepatch
[1:38:31] freetherocktv: @Towelliee what's funny is the standard TV show is 21 minutes with 9 minutes of ads in a 30min segment and yet people think 4 minutes of ads in 1 hour is horrible some how
[1:38:37] KaisenSiru: hitchMONKAS
[1:38:42] Gingerprimer: @Rudric_Ice when they annoucne launch date
[1:39:11] Gingerprimer: @freetherocktv tbf both are pretty anoying and that is why ppl have moved to streaming
[1:39:12] dngrslythicc: 50/50 split is not bad just double your amount of subs. Do better
[1:39:17] tardislessdoctor: @freetherocktv Difference is you dont miss tv show content during the ads

[1:41:04] tyler2tall89: i dont mind the ads, they just seem to happen at the worst
[1:41:06] tyler2tall89: yeah
[1:41:06] Gingerprimer: @zeeAbe true there is reason why twitch does not make a profit

[1:41:07] tyler2tall89: lol
[1:41:12] jkitchin75: whats a add?
[1:41:13] Xandorath: only thing that annoys me about ads is how repetitive they are
[1:41:15] MrKhanes: Thats why i have twitch Turbo and sub on some channels. I never see ads anymore
[1:41:22] OhHiImRob: turbo exists
[1:41:27] OhHiImRob: and is cheap
[1:41:29] Belasard: i go to smoke once every hour, so you actually would have another 2 minutes and its fine for me :P
[1:41:42] elitestudio: Twitch ads are so aggresive tho. The youtube viewing experience is so much better imo, give me the option to skip an ad & not watch the same 30 unskipable ad over n over
[1:41:44] EpicJune: yeah i dont mind them, it's more the type of ads and timing imho
[1:41:46] freetherocktv: @Towelliee I pay $8.99 a month for turbo and its wonderful
[1:41:50] MightyBone_Yumuros: ads mid matches during an esport tourney is the worst :D @Towelliee

[1:43:56] AllenzoTV: atleast everyone is the same amount of undiscoverable on youtube
[1:44:12] Gingerprimer: @SuicidalNiinja tbf his contract was still paid in full to him
[1:44:45] MattMightGame: I think Twitch's discoverability has come a long way, its just bad because of the nature of how we want to use it. We still just like going to our follow page for the most part.

[1:44:55] MattMightGame: But the recommend channels and all that has been good imo.

[1:45:38] piratechris: See running a streaming platform has costs involved with it. Streamers cannot be suprised that the streaming platforms are concerned with their own revenue or even breaking even. Some streamers yelling and shouting just need to grow up.

[1:56:27] freetherocktv: Dethridgecraft is a real OG streamer :)
[1:56:32] matching_towels: @gingerprimer I’m surprised his friends didn’t mention it to him, guess it’s not common with certain kids, maybe who don’t have close siblings. As an older person, I had to discover it myself
[1:56:38] MattMightGame: Tried for 10 years to brand and make logos for Dethridge and it was impossible pretty much. Tried many professionals and just nothing worked. Nice name but hard to brand.

[1:59:48] abracka_: if you can find a ZA group later, the entire run takes about 35-40 minutes now with everyone in brutal gear/etc. should net you more than enough justice badges for the libram

[1:59:56] Gingerprimer: @yolodoggg good leveling gear
[2:00:08] bonkyouded: @Towelliee yo i just beat the russian! were real close 30 more deaths and i would have lost

[2:00:28] headshot_hunter6: do you have honored rep in the factions for that?
[2:00:29] xFlappjacksx: Block value vs Block rating?
[2:00:51] headshot_hunter6: because to run heroic dungeons you need heroic rep and buy the key
[2:01:03] Fatallife22: rating is how likely to block, rating is how much u block
[2:01:03] LearnedSomething: blockity block block
[2:01:08] spookychefkarolina: Hey Towel, do you have any updates on your ADV ice shaker? lulaOny lulaOny

[2:01:40] abracka_: it'd probably still be easier to just run ZA, each of those dungeons would take 15-25 minutes to run

[3:45:09] smashwow: i mean the 5 minute chunk of ads right as you come into a channel can be very jarring
[3:45:09] Beud_: I think he more means pre-roll adds prevent people from checking out random streams
[3:45:16] warrenny: @mecabeast Your allowed a differant opinion than asmon
[3:45:35] Motivess: he has legitimate issues with how the ads work on the program, not with ads in general

[3:45:50] BestoftheWurst: Nah you are so right. So often people base their opinion off of the .1% people.

[3:47:57] cayna: Wait you don't like loosing 1k gold?
[3:47:59] cayna: I LOVE THAT
[3:48:17] zeeAbe: Imagine the immersion when they reach WoW Classic IMMERSEUS
[3:48:22] KyleEverett: I do get the original concept that it was supposed to make you decide if you really swapped specs enough to pay 1k vs talent reset fees
[3:48:25] cryft: bigger barriers yield bigger victories. 1000 gold made it feel better to finally get it, and gave you an opportunity to help your friends get it
[3:48:27] cayna: I legit pogged so hard when I spend my 1k gold so i can duel spec
[3:48:28] CritcobainTV: It's just like IRL, tax time bby
[3:48:28] Mecabeast: 1k dual spec after 4500 for epic flying is stopping people from respecing to heals I think

[3:51:22] KyleEverett: @Visoth that's expensive
[3:51:26] Velashen: They should stop calling it classic if they do Cata. Will just piss most people off.
[3:51:41] KeidooTV: for example once they get to mop and they stop there whats going to happen? would they keep the same concept and design new raids dungeon etc while keeping the classic feel and gameplay 🤔
[3:52:00] portend: Well, Cataclysm is the last before the revamped systems
[3:52:28] cayna: YEP
[3:52:41] aglionx: @Towelliee doubt its copy pasta, they use a system like github where you have all of the code of all of your versions...you just need to set up the server
[3:52:42] cayna: Dude season 4 was done by 2 people
[3:52:43] KyleEverett: @Velashen Cata is a decade old, it's classic
[3:52:45] cayna: iamgine how little work classic needs
[3:52:50] Streamcrush: they could just introduce affix type content to Classic and some rewards to keep it fresh for a bit longer

[3:54:04] HaxzorJimDuggan: if i get that survey im gonna shit all over it
[3:54:09] backstreetalright: They need to fix the wrongs in retail not to try and rewind the past right chat
[3:54:11] FranciscoTheMage: there is major crossover b/w retail and classic
[3:54:33] Whoisdaveeast: if we get classic cata can we also get TGN prot pala pvp toweliee back too!?!
[3:54:48] cinnamints: I'd like for them to do every xpac, but I really want the option to keep toons on Wrath servers. IMO the Fresh server players, at the very least, should have that option
[3:54:54] crunchyFrog999: pandaland classic plz
[3:54:55] captain_khyzan: shadowlands classic please!
[3:54:59] KyleEverett: I liked Cata raids. Firelands 10m was great
[3:55:02] Naturecold: WoW Classic, Classic: Season of Masteries Mastery
[3:55:03] maccaruso: I'd play it.  I like Cata
[3:55:13] Bagel09: just gonna milk it

[3:55:18] gritbarontv: lol

[3:55:31] veroggo99: i loved cata :D
[3:55:37] Whoisdaveeast: Honestly make them all except WoD BFA and SL lol
[3:55:43] KeidooTV: @kyleeverett yh could be, its just something about classic that has me hooked something retail does give me its weird
[3:55:44] ItsGigg: I think its more that nobody wants to play the garbage that is bfa/shadowlands anymore. Dragonflight looks hopeful, but i've been hopeful before
[3:55:51] abracka_: personally if they go into cata classic i'm done with it
[3:55:53] EvilMalek: you think you don't, but you di
[3:55:53] cayna: never understood why people disliked cata that much

[3:55:56] veroggo99: the raids and dungeons where great
[3:55:56] KeidooTV: doesnt
[3:55:57] cryft: people dont know why they like classic. they want barriers and challenges to overcome, but they cant help but accept game changes to make it easier
[3:55:57] cayna: PvP good
[3:55:58] dabigberto1: I'd actually like a classic cata, just because I never really played cata and mop, and would love to actually experience them
[3:55:58] FranciscoTheMage: honestly they should stop here at WRATH
[3:55:59] metalgrip: I can't play retail 12 hours a day, classic

[3:56:53] meady: Retail is pretty bad tbh way to much grinding for minor upgrades classic is just way more fun
[3:57:11] backstreetalright: Classic is a perfect amuse bouche for Dragonflight i agree with chat, But if DF fails i think this is it for wow
[3:57:17] 91Niki: @xXSiebzehnXx Doing good! Just got home from a bike ride. How about you ? :D

[3:58:08] UglyDogGaming: MONICA!
[3:58:08] KyleEverett: @vipervirus9 Classes and dungeons feel good in DF, the question is if people are okay with raid logging more
[3:58:13] meady: So grieving the maw for gem slots wasn’t a bit to much
[3:58:15] xXSiebzehnXx: @91Niki Doing alright, short work week this week
[3:58:20] Tunderknight: retail give more of a steady stream of possible upgrades and stat swaps.
[3:58:54] TheGiant99: @meady give me some of what your smoking please
[3:58:57] CritcobainTV: @meady That's optional, you didn't NEED to get those gem slots lol
[3:59:21] danimoto10: so why is he doing so much av? fast way to lvl?
[3:59:32] CritcobainTV: honor forgear @danimoto10
[3:59:37] emznev: @danimoto10  honor
[3:59:39] KyleEverett: MORE CONTENT? Heresy! :P
[3:59:40] TheGiant99: @meady that's optional stuff you choose to do it
[3:59:49] Qargory: thats people just making up reaons for their afking
[4:00:03] V3_Ethereal: only in terms of collecting, feels like less when you hit cap level so fast and you run into the M+ or raid loop
[4:00:17] twitchforaddons05: I was 15 when cataclysm came out, got full mage cata gear and eventually aeonaxx
[4:00:23] KeidooTV: they have so much potential to also experiment with season's but will see
[4:00:45] meady: I know it’s optional but you could say that about anything in retail like grinding torghast for a legendary was optional but your more likely to be in a raid with those optional extras
[4:00:45] ZenLiving: California sucks enough, I would not doubt they start to police content creators over real crime in a few years. LULW
[4:00:52] saucyshade: feral druid supremacy
[4:00:59] Tunderknight: the general idea of the MMO genre is to give each person a chance to have fun. if your having fun then go for it. if not then rethink what you are doing and what you want and go for it.
[4:01:02] TheGiant99: good Ole Candy Land
[4:01:25] HebbyB: Do you miss the days when AV took hours?
[4:01:33] martianxl: @towellliee  Do you think Blizz would be open to use Cata  assets with a different timeline, to srota keep the classic feel...
