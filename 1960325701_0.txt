[2:52:30] Draleric: rew711 oh, well it was for Rebirth so before any DLCs were even made. It was such a good fanmade mod that Edmund got the makers of Antibirth to work with him to incorporate it into the game, hence Repentance DLC was born, best version of Isaac by a landslide

He also might jump on stream earlier at random on weekdays for an extra stream. He takes his offday(s) when he needs to and usually mentions it on Discord/Twitter. Since he started a family the start time is a little flexible, use !time to see his current time.
