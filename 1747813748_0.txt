[1:52:24] chippchappi: @ModeraYsera what does that mean? 2nd batch of teams? where winner meets winners of group B
[1:52:34] morose_pleasantries: whatre the affixes?
[1:52:34] moohuu: @mix_xed I know the meaning - but I was wondering which german saying she tried to translate :D
[1:52:36] Xyronic: Healers provide essential support by keeping the group alive, removing debuffs, and providing utility. Tanks only absorb damage, but without healers, the group would quickly fall apart. In addition, healers often have more versatility and flexibility in their roles, while tanks are typically limited to their specific tanking role. Overall, healers are more valuable to a group's success than tanks.
