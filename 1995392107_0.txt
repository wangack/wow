[1:28:38] kradobes: i was gonna give WoW a chance but i got addicted to Kenshi
[1:29:08] apathy_mo: JakeStratic yea but mind sear needs rep and 5g, ppl arnt bothering rn, except the try hards
[1:29:12] HermesGrey: SP still feels bad and has the classic wow problems it sucks, feels like all classes got something awesome but SP
[1:29:18] EndingPending: what server is this?
[1:29:19] samberscurtis: I've been having too much fun with HAWKED to get back into WoW
[1:29:21] apathy_mo: kradobes such a good fking game
[1:29:28] king2beat: series X day1
[1:29:29] CostaDelSease: shroud 2h or dw for shaman?
[1:29:30] the_anderthal: so you're not using lava lash?
[1:29:41] king2beat: Xbox day 1
[1:29:42] PoterWoW: U use shield incase u wanna heal up for more
[1:29:42] kradobes: @apathy_mo is impressive i hadnt discovered before
[1:29:45] yourbillisdeau: is this hardcore? or is it available on some servers?
[1:29:53] RickestGrimes: Lava lash is bad?
[1:29:54] RimjobRoger: i didnt know shaman could tank
[1:30:09] ceiingfan: what items do you need from dead mines?
[1:30:09] Domebuddy: lava lash costs barely any mana, only benefit i guess
[1:30:14] apathy_mo: kradobes the more time u spend on it the more addicted u get, Kenshi and RImworld are the same in that vein
[1:30:24] debauss: molten blast is terrible single target damge/mana
[1:30:26] ScottieRippen: @fraglance its new for season of discovery, same with warlock tank and rogue tank
[1:30:26] JakeStratic: Lava Lash resets your proc and swing. You need a slow offhand which is hard to find
[1:30:30] PoterWoW: U use shield incase u wanna heal up for more
[1:30:30] suitlol: have you tried a slow weap with high top end in off hand?
[1:30:39] mastropiero9: GoldPLZ
[1:30:46] dogfesk: but you get a lot of mana from heals when tanking or?
[1:30:50] DubOfficial: why do i never run out of mana in retail
[1:30:53] Aluru1: is the threat generation significant?
[1:30:53] Reeeeeechard: what hud is shroud using? :D
[1:30:55] IAmTehGuy: and molten blast causes high threat so youre forced to tank with it
[1:30:59] suitlol: i think thats the idea
[1:31:01] Riftyz1337: Why don't you have Deviate scale belt?
[1:31:01] Z4_vox: if im just leveling off mobs I use lava lash cuz molten blast burns mana fast
[1:31:02] suitlol: wiuth high top end
[1:31:06] JakeStratic: Flametongue also increase in damage with speed of weapon
[1:31:07] dogfesk: pvp weapon?
[1:31:09] touk28: @yourbillisdeau this Season of Discovery, different than hardcore
[1:31:12] DeepDaze: Mace
[1:31:14] jmv_chin: 1h blue mace from WC
[1:31:15] sheeshkebab139: imagine sulfurus with lava lash at 60

[1:31:39] MoreJelly: KappaPride
[1:31:41] DeepDaze: Yeah you can abuse rockbiter with faaster.
[1:31:43] IAmTehGuy: "Callous axe" @shroud
[1:31:48] JakeStratic: That oen is also nice because it'll increase chances to proc poison

[1:34:02] apathy_mo: CombatActionDad retail is more time friendly and casual, its fun in the sense its not sweaty and u can have a social life and a job playing it, classic is kinda a life destroyer
[1:34:17] CombatActionDad: thanks @apathy_mo lol
[1:34:21] baluki_: What are you guys doing?
[1:34:27] Fossabot: Follow Mike on Twitter https://twitter.com/shroud

[1:34:41] ZometTheComet: I don’t want that
[1:34:45] CombatActionDad: when did they start doing "season" content?
[1:34:48] neg4d1d: he watch gta6?

[1:35:16] owa1sss: gta 6
[1:35:24] zapzztv: is soda's hc guild still a thing?
[1:35:27] anrupwns: classic is just time consuming is all at the start but... once you got some time in the game its better unless you create alts and what not
[1:35:31] chronjalitus: chronjalitus subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 67 months, currently on a 40 month streak! 
[1:35:32] ZometTheComet: classic is way more casual friendly
[1:35:35] ocdinsomnia: Honestly don't know much about wow. But that hardcore mode got me interested. Seems so cool
[1:35:52] ZometTheComet: my wife is having a blast with classic and she works full time
[1:35:53] lemjr8383: @combatactiondad the most fun I’ve had playing wow is hardcore classic and SoD so far. I played retail for 6 months and burned out on keeping up with the new gear
[1:35:54] CombatActionDad: I guess I have a full time job and two young kids, so I should just do retail haha
[1:36:08] apathy_mo: ZometTheComet ok depends on what u want from the game, but objectivley no
[1:36:17] DeepDaze: You can jump right away
[1:36:22] CombatActionDad: SoD is whole expansion or this "season" @lemjr8383
[1:36:23] DeepDaze: I always do

[1:37:04] Kas50: @3xohit he's watched it, check pinned comment LUL
[1:37:07] CombatActionDad: retail doesn't have good end game gear and raids @Z4_vox
[1:37:09] kademz22: @Iol69 i mean with shroud
[1:37:19] apathy_mo: ZometTheComet i played classic to rank 12 clearing all the content and still working full time, but didnt have time for other stuff, retail i can max lvl faster, get to content faster, and finish content faster
[1:37:29] CWORDPASS: Are you on the same server as Sonii and Payo? @shroud
[1:37:31] HermesGrey: right after load screen jump

[1:37:51] itsrambo: big antivenom doesn't want the scorpions nerfed
[1:37:51] vScizor: ?
[1:37:56] CombatActionDad: I meant to have question mark lolol
[1:37:58] ocdinsomnia: Would y'all discourage someone getting the game to play hardcore mode. Someone that hasn't touched wow in over 10 years lol
[1:37:59] ZometTheComet: well I didn’t enjoy the raid at all
[1:38:03] firsttimechatterman: Retail endgame sucks
[1:38:04] Selbstdarsteller: gta6 trailer is sick
[1:38:06] kademz22: we are talking about gta trailer

[1:38:25] ZometTheComet: yes the new raid in retail I quit at 460 ilvl
[1:38:28] CombatActionDad: this is classic or retail he is on now, what is the fast way for me to tell lol
[1:38:28] Eizx: @ZometTheComet What does full raid set mean? 460 isn't that high
[1:38:32] ZometTheComet: and came to SOD
[1:38:33] Praxism: lots of people self reporting in chat
[1:38:37] pepegapiglet: @ZometTheComet Too hard for you buddy?

[1:55:50] ZometTheComet: Dork as someone who’s played for 12 years it’s just an easy game
[1:55:52] HazareNae: @CursedAys correct, but you have to buy the current expansion if you want to play Retail properly, otherwise the level 20 limit doesnt really give you a good idea of what you're playing

[1:56:43] Scumbs_: hmmm so should i try classic first since it would be cheaper rather than buying a whole expansion?
[1:56:47] Mono554: is shaman like the best tank for aggro in SOD or is shroud just makin it look real nice

[3:03:31] DyreAscension: How long would it take to learn this game?
[3:03:48] James_Jaay: @xiValor i showed her too
[3:04:01] Manadr1ve: @DyreAscension idk, long for sure, if u truly wanna enjoy then take your time, if u wanna sweat then got youtube videos for that
[3:04:01] samberscurtis: @DyreAscension it's fairly low floor, high ceiling
[3:04:07] Askicky: @chat hunters need arrows again?? fk that shit was a pain
[3:04:15] xiValor: @james_jaay better start payin for these damn kids
[3:04:32] JayJazz: that would be awful
[3:04:44] Fr0nti3r: chatGPT powered bosses

[3:05:03] Fossabot: Join the Shroudcord Discord, now open for everyone! discord.gg/shroud
[3:05:03] Measai: yeah, until the ai starts input reading and boss fights become impossible
[3:05:07] James_Jaay: @xiValor na thanks, just there for the fun  AYAYA
[3:05:09] akwerdturtle: thats called pvp
[3:05:09] gino_bhu: the ai would balance it
[3:05:14] DyreAscension: @samberscurtis So, I don't need to be a super nerd to play it? I am a nerd, but I'm sure you get what I mean
[3:05:17] colonelbleezy: ai balances itself :)
[3:05:19] gino_bhu: shroud its a hypo idea you bozo lol
[3:05:21] anilahation: auto generated bosses sound bad i already hate auto generated dungeons
[3:05:22] Askicky: AI vs AI
[3:05:29] denidenipavlovic: !pc

[3:05:30] clarkthecaveman: ai taking er jobs
[3:05:35] TiqerWoW: have 5 different versions of the fight and have each instance is rng
[3:05:39] Rey40fp: AI is constrained to do mechanics on the fly based on the classes that are inside the instnace
[3:05:43] Measai: or the ai adapts to the group
[3:05:46] Shnozzuru: every dungeon would be a discovery
[3:05:51] CloochGaming: naw you can just code the ai to not exceed a certian dps limit based on the content
[3:05:58] Pakt__: thatd be amazing
[3:05:59] TiredFluffey: there are webnovels exploring the concept of AI generated games
[3:06:05] bodvahr: No way to learn the boss mechanics then
[3:06:19] clarkthecaveman: @bodvahr good more fun that way
[3:06:23] HazareNae: @TiredFluffey Overgeared is my favorite of that genre
[3:06:23] denidenipavlovic: Shroud can you give me 1 pc bro?

[3:06:34] shadorien: how would anyone complete random dungeon without guides and youtube? think of the kids
[3:06:38] Measai: +1 PogU
[3:06:41] samberscurtis: @DyreAscension I don't think so at all. If you check out some of the OnlyFangs Hardcore WoW content I'd say that version is considerably harder than other versions and beginners are being fairly succesful in their guild
[3:06:42] nanoproner22: Wich server is this?
[3:06:42] Rey40fp: @bodvahr learning boss mechanics its actually a bit lame imo cause everyone expects you to know them even on release
[3:06:46] RedNuker: shroudBnans

[3:07:23] ItsYojimbo: how does he have both factions on the same server
[3:07:29] BANEFIGHTER: 1600 hp is alot on this lvl for real
[3:07:31] ItsYojimbo: oh different accounts
[3:07:42] ItsYojimbo: its probably different accounts
[3:07:46] dragoniitezz: @Rey40fp WoW has a lot of gatekeepers. I was declined BFD raids because I didn't do it on the first lockout available.

[3:09:16] wEiRdO_dUdE: Quitters never win!
[3:09:18] Eliazer813: every class needs fish oil

[3:10:43] JdubCT: The blackened defias chestpiece looks -badass-. It's why it doesn't drop often. =P
[3:10:51] Measai: I skipped 21-24 with just 5 dm runs

[3:12:39] JdubCT: Warlocks seem like they'd be busto
[3:12:43] bodvahr: @rey40fp somthing can probably be done, but I dont think total randomness is the way

[3:19:21] OrganicPasta: Did you get anything cool out of the raid?
[3:19:23] cptscuttlebutt: at 25 you still want all runes , those cost gold ,  so you need to do quests or farm gold to achieve that and then there is gear and reputation
[3:19:39] justwengit: how long does it take to get to 60?
[3:19:39] Fabreh: I hope next phase mobs are buffed so everything we farm now feels useful
[3:19:41] TiqerWoW: i think 4 weeks is plenty of time for this phase tbh
[3:19:44] icecubedude_: @cptscuttlebutt and professions

[3:23:43] HazareNae: @Neskymos think of it this way, it took you 3 days to get to 25 and be geared enough to raid. Then you enter raid with (people claim) 5 weeks and 4 days left. That's 39 days, 13 resets.

[5:16:15] pizzaman19764: @spekky my guess is that this phase is more of an alpha. so everything is toned down so they know how all this stuff affects gameplay
[5:16:17] fargaN__: whats the name of the addon for check the fpscounter and ping ms ???? anyone knows?
[5:16:28] CbearDongy: melee need to be at max melee range too. closest to boss gets mind blasted. so tank should be closest at all times
[5:16:32] sir_mudkip90: Is water shield good for bosses?

[5:21:52] johnath_n: i think spreading out during 2nd phase is good because of the shadow volley thing right?
[5:21:53] pizzaman19764: how hard is the bfd raid?
[5:21:56] YuuffyOnTwitch: pet tank doesnt work. He just targets the pet and casts on random targets.
[5:22:16] pizzaman19764: compared to other vanilla raids
[5:22:35] reefo: @pizzaman19764 full cleared it 2x already, much harder than anything in normal classic, but stompable within 1 week

[5:24:22] pizzaman19764: @reefo damn. makes me want to play
[5:24:32] Shnozzuru: it bugs it where it doesnt cast he just autos
[5:24:38] reefo: @pizzaman19764 the raid is sick dude, and if this is what is to come, it's going to be worth it.

[6:13:39] Measai: websites can spawn "web worker" which do stuff on another thread. Maybe one of your tabs is using that to mine monero
[6:13:46] slayu_: why did you go shaman
[6:13:53] DragonWithSunglasses: "If you often use the Mozilla Firefox browser, you may be familiar with the Firefox memory leak error. What causes Firefox using too much memory? The major cause behind the error comes from resource-consuming extensions. In addition, using too many tabs and outdated version can trigger the error."
