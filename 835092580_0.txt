Sims are made with a 5% margin for error. 95% of the wow population is playing a lot worse than 5% error margin, which mean DH can perform waay better than other classes, since everybody are playing a lot worse than the Sim

[10:49:47] Bragez: @famewxlf but yes, you have to execute better as DH to keep up with a subrogue. but if you arent literally playing at the same error margin as the sim, then theres really not point to make your choices based on the sim, its only a guideline.

You guys are honestly just as bad as him as you watch his streams and fill his pockets. The thing he did is like getting your World of Warcraft account deleted. Shit is just uncalled for and truly disgusting. I hope you understand what you are supporting by viewing this demon-human.
