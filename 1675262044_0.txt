[1:06:15] Frantixx: Cant the nerfs on such things come from the scaleing maybe? With higher ilvl gear coming up?
[1:06:19] D3mitr1: @rosina_scarlett they were already taking warriors
[1:06:22] cyrex172: @Screamnsteam what do u see the pvp meta looking like now
[1:06:24] GX_Jim: tanks will just pull less in one go? dps will live longer

Completing the additional quest each week will grant you another  Spark of Ingenuity. This means that your second Spark of Ingenuity is not available until December 12th or the start of Season 1.
