[1:01:59] cyclonos: they owe liquid the majority of nerf as a make good
[1:02:04] TweektheProphet: I mean at this point is there any good timing for a nerf
[1:02:20] sinlesssinner: i been having this feeling like Echo wont be winning this race no matter what.
[1:02:21] Zerodur1: I feel the same way...bad timed nerf inc.
[1:02:24] sinlesssinner: just a feeling tho :)
[1:02:50] mavericks312: yea and you know if nerfs happen on resets the community is gonna be hella toxic
[1:02:57] king_julian_96: when the adds get nerfed we might finally get to see p3
[1:03:12] chazemoto: Method caught up also
[1:03:12] king_julian_96: and see what changes there are in p3 on mythic
[1:03:37] sinlesssinner: its not that liquid is better, just a set of circumstances will be detrimental to Echo for some reason, a gut feeling @Towelliee
[1:03:41] chazemoto: its neck to neck right now thats for sure

[1:05:00] strike879: not sure if anyone els noticed this too but in rumble in the 3x3 shop grid its always 5 minis and 4 empty spaces and it removes the lines where the bought mini is so if you swap where the one you buy is you can cheaply reset for minis you want
[1:05:15] mavericks312: yea blizz did liquid hella dirty there

[1:05:58] Deathchampt: blizz bad at math no shot
[1:06:06] BoezIRL: the race should just take in consideration the total times it takes a guild to end the raid from the moment it's available to them

[1:20:39] strike879: possibly they noticed the typo in newer packs and you just got an old pack that got shipped before the typo got noticed

[1:28:36] Holysal: @king_julian_96 I think echo will win bc this is shaping up to be a long tier and it favors them. Liquid already slowing down
[1:29:11] nihilistic_bat: Slowing down? hmm not sure where that view comes from
[1:29:39] lahuskie: its the 30th SOD comes right? or is it sooner
[1:29:45] Holysal: @nihilistic_bat they got off early and will being getting on late today
[1:29:54] ArcaneSyntax: "long race hurts Liquid" I don't think holds much water anymore tbh
[1:30:10] king_julian_96: if anythign i think liquid will get the kill
[1:30:32] king_julian_96: i think liquid will get it when echo is asleep
[1:30:36] nihilistic_bat: @Holysal They logged after the one good pull they had in a couple of hours. They were waiting for that to sleep.

[1:33:02] nihilistic_bat: if the nerf happens today it will happen real soon

[1:34:55] crrdsh: would be cool to have an ai arm  only and see how they could learn and if they could beat it
[1:35:05] nihilistic_bat: since Liquid will be late or whatever, there likely could be a hotfix this morning...maybe they know...
[1:35:19] propwash80: @Towelliee do you know any sites where i can find different ui that ppl shared?
[1:35:27] ravimatrixx: hey towelliee
[1:35:28] wEiRdO_dUdE: I think Blizzard might just let it go for a few days
[1:35:30] king_julian_96: buty eah atm the moment there is only a .3 difference between echo and liquid liquid is 58.7% and echo is 58.4%
[1:35:48] mavericks312: @nihilistic_bat problem with that is blizz is still on hoiday
[1:35:57] nihilistic_bat: @propwash80 not fully sure what you mean but Tukui/Eluvi are great
[1:36:09] nihilistic_bat: @mavericks312 Right, not them all though.
[1:37:27] propwash80: @nihilistic_bat you know how we can custumize our ui and share it, is there a site where i can find what ppl uploaded so i can try them?
[1:37:37] Clicklesly: @wEiRdO_dUdE Well, unless they nerf it right now it probably stays like this until Monday
[1:37:52] king_julian_96: i just want this race to end so i can finally get my fryakk leggo for my dk

[4:42:36] jdickson93: i dont get how its 2023 we have global launch for xpacs and stuff yet patch days are different
[4:42:42] MasqureMan: why do they put races near the holidays?
[4:42:52] Screamnsteam: Jebaited
[4:43:00] mavericks312: @Niksen_99 if you have a RWF server then how do you handle the normal server first kill
[4:43:10] c0mmander_starscream: You would have some very sweaty people if the race lasted 30 days
[4:43:11] Veegore: @MasqureMan why do football games happen on holidays
[4:43:17] TheeCableguy: Ranger up 2 to 0 on Flyers
[4:43:38] nihilistic_bat: Hockey updates you didn't want or cared about :D
[4:43:40] Screamnsteam: well then the rest of the world world cry that resets are at inconvient times
[4:43:42] TheeCableguy: I got you
[4:43:55] nihilistic_bat: Sad times for Hockey except for hockey fans
[4:44:23] nihilistic_bat: Jak will take one for the caster team
[4:44:35] TheeCableguy: Remember Dratnos being stuck there for echo by himself?
[4:44:49] mavericks312: so your gonna inconvience the 99% for the 1%
[4:45:07] Niksen_99: @mavericks312 u dont. its a seperate event
[4:45:10] Dkgungo: is thds eyes even open
[4:45:15] ArcaneMaki: lol imagine being that person unsubbing for that reason
[4:45:16] Molvonos: Oh no, people are that dumb.
[4:45:21] Veegore: I think they could do without the casters TBH, all week Max has had almost 3 times the amount of viewers than the casted channel.  If he had the scene up with the prog/attempt #'s.   i think yesterday the liquid channel was 10k and max's was 30k
[4:45:22] nihilistic_bat: Thd eyes are never open
[4:45:47] mavericks312: @Niksen_99 but thats the problem if you allow other guilds not on that server to get the achievement then who is the real winner

[4:46:10] nihilistic_bat: 30k dont dual watch
[4:46:10] garmin1987: we have you to watch
[4:46:14] TheeCableguy: If you cant play warlock with your eyes closed you havent sold enough of your soul to the class yet.
[4:46:19] Mecabeast: i just want the race to be done so i can start farming the legendary XD
[4:46:25] Menion01: That's because Max has comms on.
[4:46:33] mavericks312: is because its the cavs vs warriors all over again

[4:46:36] MasqureMan: i like hearing the casters, first time i watched a race
[4:46:41] Niksen_99: everyone is allowed. the one on RWF server is the real winner @mavericks312
[4:46:46] Dkgungo: people dont wanna watch 300+ pulls
[4:46:47] jason_tacey: hardcore seems to be take the steam away from RWF
[4:47:09] nihilistic_bat: I did, but it was just side eye stuff while working
[4:47:19] Veegore: @MasqureMan they seem so dry most of the time, i like hearing the strat and discussions.  but yea if they have to shut off the stream having the casters makes sense
[4:47:37] Rob3phones: I generally dont even tune in until a guild is sub 10%
[4:48:02] jdickson93: all difficulties but not all regions LUL
[4:48:12] nihilistic_bat: when echo was close to Tswift, the viewership on the Liquid channel shot up
[4:48:14] TheeCableguy: Hot take all of LFR should be available week 1
[4:48:23] nihilistic_bat: err Liquid I mean, it was wild to see
[4:48:26] jason_tacey: viewership wise my bad @Towelliee
[4:49:13] nihilistic_bat: They do look cleaner side by side
[4:49:22] mavericks312: nah do it when echo is asleep lol
[4:49:51] TheeCableguy: It's actually kinda wild how similar Fyrak boss is to Razzy G. Just 1 platform
[4:49:57] Niksen_99: Now would be the worst time imo
[4:50:08] omezy23: 12% is crazy
[4:50:14] Niksen_99: Liquid would turn off stream ?
[4:50:39] smiles82: they woke up super early today, so they won't have 5hours left
[4:50:52] ArcaneMaki: what if special secret phase @Towelliee ?
[4:51:12] mavericks312: if they were to nerf it again why liquid was sleeping blizz would face so much backlash
[4:51:19] the_rendr: TheIlluminati
[4:51:23] nihilistic_bat: now that Liquid started though, no nerfs today
[4:51:26] TweektheProphet: agreed when both guilds are awake and running in the next 2hrs would be the time

[4:51:52] vaironixx: idk if that was today or what
[4:51:54] nihilistic_bat: on a friday after a holiday tho?
[4:51:58] nihilistic_bat: waaa
[4:52:00] nihilistic_bat: whaaaaa
[4:52:06] omezy23: no it hasnt happened
[4:52:09] mavericks312: there is no bluw post or anything about it
[4:52:10] c0mmander_starscream: need to take an IV caffeine drip
[4:52:15] pellesnutbil: Yes nerf confirmed
[4:52:16] vaironixx: 12% hp nerf only on infernals (the big adds P2) 89->78 million health
[4:52:17] bygodwest: you'll know it happened when the adds HP is down to like 78 mil from 89 mil
[4:52:19] vaironixx: not sure that has happened yet
[4:52:25] Molvonos: @c0mmander_starscream Why go so soft?  Coffee suppository or bust.
[4:52:28] Niksen_99: If blizz nerf anything Liquid will turn off stream while Echo is sleeping. Sounds really lame
[4:52:30] TheeCableguy: No news yet about it tho
[4:52:32] nihilistic_bat: :P
[4:52:42] nihilistic_bat: I been waiting bro but no comms to us plebs
