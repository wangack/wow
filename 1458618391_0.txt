[1:17:47] MayroVision: Wait, so you’re not in “Shadow lands” expansion?
[1:17:55] blade_killa: hello all
[1:17:55] Artiiz: @Mitune how would you explore the zones then
[1:18:07] Mitune: I mean no new level cap @Artiiz

[1:19:02] Artiiz: @Mitune Personally lvling in zones is how you explore them the most, otherwise you just fly to the certain area you are needed to go
[1:19:11] swordart2022: @mayrovision WutFace
[1:19:18] WarlockD: Humm, yea I think shadowlands would be the best place for leveling

[1:20:26] Mitune: Dungeons would prob still be locked behind story
[1:20:34] Ortinoth: i don't think they will raise the level cap

[2:38:24] wisplingz: ptsd intensifies
[2:38:24] Malfleur: @pereadin Then - depending on your hardware - reinstall Win10 with the newest version and keep it up to date OR install Win11. Both options are viable
[2:38:26] HilariousMax: ew
[2:38:33] 91Niki: @pereadin I used to have that issue on a laptop. You might wanna completely fresh install. I never found another fix for it

[2:38:58] HilariousMax: no pet?
[2:39:03] pereadin: Only holy paladins like that dungeon for the dps on the last boss lol
[2:39:07] manmower: bfa dungeons were a bit better than SL i think
[2:39:08] PvtHudson093: TD when Twilight debastation could pul thru the wall D:
[2:39:11] nightmayor12: Underrot tryranical exsplosive
[2:39:11] MedicineMan: Underrot is crused.  I never had a smooth run in that place lol
[2:39:13] CrniOrao: I liked Shrine, was fun healing as monk and gettin 100% dmg increase as well on last boss

[2:41:28] darssia_: kings rest was definitely my favorite bfa dungeon
[2:41:33] balancedlight: Shrine of the storm had a really cool scenery and theme. Its completely overtuned even now but still it was... different and it had an epicness to it that is lost on a lot of content now a days
[2:41:33] Cyberangel89: @warrenny I remember
[2:43:04] swordart2022: Crystal song forest music now I think chat

[2:50:33] Glodwran468: No popping happening for me, just a weird grey patch in the left side of your beard that I can't tell if it's lighting, or if it's actually there.
[2:50:37] cahoots82: So weird... Welcome adventurer... than you for aiding the Dragonflight. Please take one of us for use as a mount and another to be your pet you force into battle
[2:50:47] manmower: warriors should get their own windfury totem instead
[2:50:57] faulen: personal lust please
[2:51:01] cosmoflake: with the amount of feedback the wow devs have been getting, the hiring of tons of testers, you could almost expect the new expac to be really good COPIUM

[2:51:43] maccaruso: Shadowlands tomorrow?  I'm so sorry.
[2:51:52] Scoodles91: they are good now
[2:51:57] Frenaris: nope, only gives you extra time on rested
[2:51:59] nephttv_: oh are they not? shows you how long its been since i leveled lol
[2:52:13] SureSquire: Enh is typically good whenever arms is good, not really outside of that
[2:52:23] wEiRdO_dUdE: The strongest point of heirloom gear is just not having to change it out while you level, now
[2:52:35] manmower: enh is good on its own atm
[2:52:43] SureSquire: They used to be a great funnel class
[2:52:50] manmower: shaman class is in a really good spot after SL rework

[2:55:33] DevilSpire: what did they change?
[2:55:52] pereadin: Survival nerfs will barely matter. Only for the biggest of pulls will we notice it.
[2:56:18] MILESkg21: is it broken monkaS
[2:56:33] manmower: survival still needs to be buffed after they take away the tier bonuses, the base class for next xpac

[3:35:21] lithium364: imagine a new range class as mobile as demonhunters 4Head goodbye all other range classes
[3:35:22] Reklawtam: would be cool
[3:35:25] Kisswani: New intro too I assume ? @Towelliee

[3:35:45] souleymaster: is Dead wings coming back ?
[3:35:49] NickLeonhearth: I have a lot of friends who lost interest in WoW I wonder what they can show to bring them back
[3:35:59] Kneckt: i'd like that
[3:36:10] manmower: maybe accountwide too
[3:36:14] Snabido: Sounds like a better alternative than SL's launch
[3:36:14] Kisswani: Yeah I was in favor or having us switch covenants once we finished the campaign
[3:36:22] Praetour: Deathwing resurrected as Dead Wing @souleymaster ?
[3:36:26] Praetour: I'm for it
[3:36:31] stallowned: ya that makes most sense
[3:36:37] dyslexican1: I really want the rewards for each aspect to unlock once i finsish their story, and STAY unlocked specifically cosmetic rewards. before I move on to the nesxt.

[3:36:58] souleymaster: yep he was dead rigth
[3:36:59] Coriollis: ignored alpha feedback /shrug
[3:37:02] Dainakon: seu totoso
[3:37:06] Kisswani: The whiners will just switch " I dont want to have to switch all the time , it's time consuming "
[3:37:07] HaxzorJimDuggan: i think every aspect power should be the same just cometic differences
[3:37:08] Praetour: Can't wait for Aspect Power grind
[3:37:13] obbi87: Nah. i want to learn them all at once, let me have each cov. spell as a talent. This switiching  cov is boring imo
[3:37:14] Purplous: 100% agree
[3:37:17] HaxzorJimDuggan: cosmetic
[3:37:26] DeanoTV: @Praetour better than 0 grind
[3:37:27] Evotype: bless you
[3:37:29] Rudric_Ice: just make it cosmetic only
[3:37:36] Reklawtam: But, what if we get a new class, Dragonkin, where you have 4 (four) specs and each spec if of the 4 aspects of the dragons, Red, Bronze, Arcane, Life.  and the talents would correspond with each. Red Melee, Brronze tank, Arcane range, Life healing
[3:37:36] fluh_: bless u sweetheart
[3:37:47] lithium364: i hope we see new armor in the trailer, but they might not be that far advanced in development
[3:37:49] Kisswani: Power if you can switch freely is not an issue
[3:37:52] lurker198: cosmetics are lame to me
[3:37:55] manmower: if it's endless power, how will alts work?
[3:37:57] mavericks312: give them higher ilvl gear that you can buy from each dragonflight
[3:38:04] MILESkg21: unsubbed after Nathria

[3:38:32] Gotxiko: each dragonflight should work just as a reputation, use it to revamp the rep system
[3:38:36] Rudric_Ice: can we have corruptions back ?
[3:38:37] duhworks: make rep meaning full
[3:38:38] Malnar1123: World of Warcraft: Account Wide
[3:38:40] stratiss: account wide AP would be great, imagine alt friendly BFA
[3:38:45] manmower: if they made all alt progress feed into one account pool, that would be cool
[3:39:03] borgraman: @Towelliee would prefer no more levels and give paragon levels for 10 lvls with new talents
[3:39:11] stratiss: Ybarra tweeted it's not happening
[3:39:15] Aidler: I think we need something to grind like AP in 10.0
[3:39:17] DeanoTV: @borgraman me too something new!
[3:39:22] Royin2k3: bet its gonnsa happen though

[4:08:18] MistaHat: Def feel like this raid lasted too long. I think there might be an incentive to lower boss count into next expac. Maybe even less raid size of peeps

[4:17:06] toobaked1987: toobaked1987 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 33 months! LETS FUCKING GO!!!!
[4:17:07] Collected1: the no levelling if already max level is a crazy concept if true
[4:17:08] TheCliffyShow: That guy probably lost his shit when the name was leaked to be Dragonflight. Now, his post is getting so much attention.
[4:17:13] Poriand: i want housing with profession tied to it
[4:17:15] N3llee: Him getting the name right speaks volumes to me
[4:17:18] Rudric_Ice: sure Kappa
[4:17:21] oneifbyland: that head shake-nod LUL
[4:17:27] Ambersulfr: that's gorgeous
[4:17:31] peinen: Kreygasm Kreygasm Kreygasm
[4:17:32] TheCliffyShow: Inb4 it turns out to be Talisen's leak.
[4:17:33] TheItalianStallion321: yo that looks sick though
[4:17:34] manmower: looks fake
[4:17:36] TheItalianStallion321: great art
[4:17:36] MILESkg21: MORE Kreygasm
[4:17:40] MistaHat: @N3llee idk, the shadowlands was guessed with nothing else really sticking
[4:18:07] cliche_cat: yes
[4:18:08] N3llee: @MistaHat the name wasnt guess 2 months prior to any other leaks homie
[4:18:08] Moobot: World of Wacraft 10.0 Expansion LEAKED ON MAIN SITE! Could be deflection? Mebbe? THRE BE DRAGONS! https://www.wowhead.com/news/world-of-warcraft-dragonflight-expansion-leaks-on-blizzard-website-326583 We are doing a 24 stream for the expansion announcement. Be here!
[4:18:14] manmower: that's not a WoW art style
[4:18:15] pavepawns: the thing on the website was first then this like 1 hour later if i remember right
[4:18:31] martacus423: yes, to my knowledge
[4:18:37] Poriand: i would be surpised if we got a new class
[4:18:42] Birder_L: its good art eitherway
[4:18:53] MistaHat: @MistaHat it was early i thought, legit.
[4:19:18] TheCliffyShow: As a goblin player, I would love to see Undermine.
[4:19:28] monute316: if it is true i wanna know who we go from shadowlands to dragons story wise
[4:19:30] ashwing_: Uldaz is from the chamber of the hearth
[4:19:32] Collected1: how would people feel about not having to level up if you're already 60?
[4:19:33] ashwing_: that is legit
[4:19:43] monute316: how
[4:19:43] swordart2022: Or they had premade stuff based on possibliteis
[4:19:46] Kneckt: thats the most legit looking leak of art ieve evr seen
[4:19:47] N3llee: that guy though had the xpac name right back in Feb
[4:19:48] abracka_: @Collected1 ask ESO and GW2 players lol
[4:19:49] TheCliffyShow: That one another guy who is really good at name guessing.
[4:19:49] Kneckt: besides bolvar
[4:19:49] swordart2022: and just posted what fit name
[4:20:10] DarkSection10: towelliee what zodiac are you?
[4:20:24] Velashen: @abracka_ Those games are structured around Horizontal progression though. Wow is not.
[4:20:41] magemaster225: the leaks are coming from inside the house
[4:20:44] IggiePuff: IggiePuff subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 62 months, currently on a 5 month streak! 
[4:20:50] cliche_cat: towlie is definitely a taruas
[4:20:55] Poriand: i hate leveling in all games
[4:20:59] DarkSection10: i think so too
[4:21:02] Cafe0le: fuck levelling
[4:21:03] abracka_: @Velashen oh yeah absolutely, i don't think it would work well in WoW. works well in those games though
[4:21:04] DarkSection10: :D
[4:21:07] duhworks: leveling is a out dated system for wow
[4:21:09] TheCliffyShow: I like leveling through a new expansion.
[4:21:12] snuffles_80: no lvling? hell no :)
[4:21:13] Collected1: levelling up was the best part of SL for me
[4:21:18] manmower: keep the cap at 60 and reset everyone to level 1
[4:21:19] akia03: without lvlinh wouldnt that mean allot more systems
[4:21:23] phreakzyy: leveling in a new expansion is the best part
[4:21:39] Mallaes: I wouldN't mind, but yeah
[4:21:41] duhworks: just give us accout wide story for like 3-4 hours
[4:21:41] maybe_torq: "Essential" no... customary maybe
[4:21:50] crittinkitten: You can still "level" but make the "level story" give AP or whatever instead
[4:22:04] Birder_L: leveling felt more interesting when you got new abilities, to me
[4:22:10] manmower: make them level up the aspect lines
[4:22:32] tToaad: whens the next vegas trip @Towelliee
[4:22:38] thungdil: in some recent expansions lvling up sorta made you weaker tho
[4:22:46] Velashen: Blizz has already had trouble with leveling into new expansions making you feel weaker.
[4:22:51] JWoody82: The system is a system of systems
[4:22:52] Cafe0le: leveling is just a hurdle, remove it
[4:23:19] abracka_: i can see them adding the azerite/artifact/etc system has a side leveling system similar to ESO or more recently lost ark's roster perks/leveling
[4:23:20] joedeec: Kinda looks like WoW is going backwards
[4:23:24] YeahImJordan: @Cafe0le so what do you add instead?
[4:23:27] cliche_cat: i kinda like leveling, but more surama like zones would definitely be awesome
[4:23:41] Galkresh: !9to5

[4:23:57] vintersorgSA: this will be first xpac i dont preorder, just no faith. will wait after a month to see if its worth returning for
[4:23:59] KombatWombat07: like D3 paragon?\
[4:24:00] instant_savage: guild wars 2 there is no lvling once u hit the cap, the new expansion is just story and mastery and stuff like that
[4:24:04] Ezekyler: no leveliong will feel like a patch instad an expansion @Towelliee
[4:24:04] mavericks312: without new levels players would riot
[4:24:07] phreakzyy: never
[4:24:09] cliche_cat: in pvp
[4:24:09] Ambersulfr: scare beast is used in pvp a lot
[4:24:09] Cafe0le: pvp to fear xuen
[4:24:09] Teypey: No
[4:24:10] Daismoon: pvp
[4:24:11] swordart2022: yes

[4:24:13] phreakzyy: in pve atleast
[4:24:14] SanctusPrior: in pvp yues
[4:24:14] GameingAspect: if it fears in place maybe
[4:24:16] nightmayor12: nah. waste of a bind
[4:24:34] akia03: feral druids hate that spel
[4:24:36] monute316: wizard of oz fight lol
[4:24:44] mavericks312: @Ezekyler not really you can level other things outside of your player level like a dragonaspect power system
[4:24:45] SultabMN: @Towelliee Why are leveling Hunter?
[4:25:16] painful_gamingtv: @Towelliee what is that mod in the upper left that shows your main stats?
[4:25:21] Poriand: i see them doing housing but it will be guild housing and ill be sad
[4:25:23] ktrain92: !9TO5

[4:25:40] manmower: maybe they make us level 50 again?
[4:25:48] xziyn: Maybe a story campaign for like 3 to 5 hours to unlock Paragon levels? Like a longer Artifact weapon questline
[4:25:50] GeoSourge: wow community always crying about something KEKW
[4:25:54] tomcruise210: just give me wrath already dang it  󠀀 󠀀
[4:25:57] Collected1: there has to be a reason to progress the story line and all the new quests at least once, and if it's not linked to level number then it has to be linked to something else surely
[4:26:04] luckfore: leveling isnt an adventure anymore, its just a rush to max level. they should try a paragon system imo
[4:26:07] Nice_n_Dicey: GW2 makes no levelling on expacs work
[4:26:09] Aegrial: i could see it working if you had to level 10 levels of your dragonflight covenent or whatever.
[4:26:13] mavericks312: another number squish back to back though?
[4:26:18] cliche_cat: or 60 - 65
[4:26:27] Syprus1: i hope 60-70
[4:26:27] Collected1: going to 70 makes no sense after introducing chromie time which has worked very well
[4:26:29] akia03: shadowlands was a dream so we wake up and are still lvl 50 from before sl
[4:26:45] Navymeadows: could introduce alternative ability leveling, like old school everquest
[4:26:45] abracka_: i miss my 15 million hp bear tank in legion
[4:26:46] nightmayor12: oh good call it could be a 5 level expac
[4:26:48] Cafe0le: if there is leveling i rather them squish us down again to 50
[4:26:48] Poriand: I miss BC / wrath numbers i like small numbers
[4:26:48] vDrYuukey: they didnt escalate as much as in bfa
[4:26:49] GameingAspect: there not end of drenor 3m dps
[4:26:49] DeanoTV: or just go to 65
[4:26:49] MILESkg21: 3 Mil Chaos Bolts LuL
[4:26:51] Reckless_Monk: perpectually stay at 60 though?
[4:26:52] chippydogs: most people just race past the lvling anyway so as long as the alternative system is good think its worth a shot.
[4:26:54] DeanoTV: 5 leverls every expac
[4:26:58] SpeedyBread: agreed! so it makes sense to just squish, everytime there is an expansion and be done with it, and move on
[4:26:59] Funderik: legion numbers was wild and really meant nothing, no point being that high
[4:27:00] luckfore: i loved seeing my chaos bolts doing 2-3mil damage :D
[4:27:19] darssia_: ilvl getting a little high already imo.
[4:27:19] nvnto: We have to relevel from 1-60, cause we are reborn as dragons Kappa
[4:27:23] mavericks312: like i said a power up of a dragon aspect could replace leveling
[4:27:23] Syprus1: @luckfore  LUL riffSamurai towLets towGo towBeer
[4:27:39] Graviits: I liked the Legion Numbers man.
[4:27:43] PvtHudson093: Getting a top 100 parse on Mythic Maut made BFA great for me
[4:28:00] GameingAspect: galagrond comes back?
[4:28:00] DeanoTV: KEKW
[4:28:03] MistaHat: im the dragonmaster
[4:28:08] MistaHat: DRAGON THESE NUTS
[4:28:18] Densetsu_: So who will be the main baddy? Chromatus will probably be one, but who will be the "main" one?
[4:28:27] BoezIRL: i just want a dragon race

[4:28:33] DeanoTV: @Towelliee what about just 5 levels every expac? so 65
[4:28:33] Reckless_Monk: man I dreamt last night that i was playing the expansion.. never done that for any expasion.. im actually beyond hype
[4:28:34] MILESkg21: remade into WOW 2 POGGERS
[4:28:34] Kneckt: nut
[4:28:35] Poriand: that be alot of work

[4:28:38] Syprus1: Great channel you got a good crew and community this is the only channel that keeps me coming back that i actively enjoy
[4:28:45] cswowko: we reborn as Jailers... its all master plan
[4:28:50] Rinizon: might as well make wow2 if they are doing all that.
[4:28:53] luckfore: illidan fell asleep and sargeras slipped out, chase him into the cosmos
[4:28:56] TheItalianStallion321: yeah i was gonna, that just sounds like WoW 2
[4:28:58] nvnto: DA WOONZ oh no!!
[4:28:59] GameingAspect: paragon leveling system
[4:28:59] Densetsu_: Heal the woons WutFace
[4:29:00] SanctusPrior: @DeanoTV they did that already with cata and mop
[4:29:01] TheItalianStallion321: which still isnt bad
[4:29:08] gooseboy429: still got a big ass sword in azeroth
[4:29:09] Funderik: they could make that work, we have to og through a rebirth after being in SL so long and it's reset us to 1
[4:29:16] manmower: Azeroth is about to turn 18, time for her to get out on her own
[4:29:20] snuffles_80: I hated that dwarf in the end
[4:29:20] MILESkg21: WHAT SWORD KEKW
[4:29:22] DeanoTV: @bladenomad i know but would be easier than squishing again
[4:29:29] GameingAspect: paragone leveling
[4:29:51] Syprus1: Syprus1 is gifting 2 Tier 1 Subs to Towelliee's community! They've gifted a total of 18 in the channel!

[4:30:08] abracka_: khadgar sounds like a 90 year old man now
[4:30:11] Funderik: prepatch could be wild if it's dragon stuffs
[4:30:12] Draethar: @Towelliee My favorite Towelliee content over the years has been your beta gameplay for new expacs
[4:30:19] nvnto: doesnt time flow slower in the SL or something like that?
[4:30:37] GameingAspect: do you think paragone leveling system would work in wow? level beyound 60 get a perk
[4:30:44] luckfore: POGGERS alpha/beta cycles are best times
[4:30:45] Mallaes: OSFrog
[4:30:48] Mallaes: tovgFrog
[4:31:08] Rinizon: The hard part is getting them to listen to the feedback :)
[4:31:22] MILESkg21: 4-6 months then
[4:31:29] abracka_: can we get a head nod for preorders tuesday?
[4:31:33] Collected1: nah sorry i'm spamming F5 already

[4:33:11] N3llee: not everyone is pissed... only people upset are the guilds that havent cleared BT Hijal 15 weeks in now

[4:33:15] peinen: End of Jan
[4:33:17] Funderik: it will get cleared within a couple hours regardless
[4:33:18] Zerfell: They say if they will gate Sunwell progress like the original?
[4:33:19] manmower: wrath will probably come out before 10.0 to keep things rolling
[4:33:20] HaxzorJimDuggan: like february
[4:33:21] KombatWombat07: didnt people want old content to be released faster?
[4:33:23] TigbittiesXXL: most people aren't bis

[4:33:29] Haharmes: 12 weeks i think
[4:33:35] DingDongDean: Wasn't it half january ?
[4:33:35] maybe_torq: Wasnt that also the Sunwell treatment? I think that was the mentality of guilds going into WotLK. Not many guilds cleared Sunwell
[4:33:37] N3llee: @Rudric_Ice you are a moron
[4:33:40] tomcruise210: just give us a month pre patch  󠀀 󠀀
[4:33:48] maybe_torq: Could be wrong though
[4:33:53] Rudric_Ice: @Rudric_Ice nah im right
[4:33:56] swervo61: Did LFD in wrath become usable at lvl 15 like it does in shadowlands?
[4:33:57] HaxzorJimDuggan: i just hope our rogue gets his offhand glaive before sunwell because i do not want to go back once sunwell comes out

[4:37:03] Snabido: Cata had 3/3 instead of 5/5 max points
[4:37:03] nightmayor12: it changed in mop
[4:37:03] fred_birkhoff: pandaria ruined everything
[4:37:03] GameingAspect: a patch took it
[4:37:04] xziyn: Yeah Cata did
[4:37:11] magemaster225: they were simplified but yeah
[4:37:14] lithium364: unless youre dk and got 7-8 builds to play
[4:37:14] Hitokiri83: @Ldysansa thats when it released
[4:37:17] tomcruise210: they should implement it early tho really
[4:37:18] Senthius09: yea didnt cata just have them pared down by a lot?
[4:37:18] MisterRonB: @Towelliee I think your timer is off by an hour.  9am Pacific on Tuesday is an hour earlier than your timer on screen.  Its 9:28 now Pacific.
[4:37:20] nightmayor12: yes
[4:37:21] fred_birkhoff: yea
[4:37:23] cliche_cat: no it was cata
[4:37:25] nitemare34godd: @Towelliee wonder if wolk classic will go threw to bfa classic all in one that would be sweet
[4:37:27] Dkgungo: pretty sure that was a cata patch
[4:37:28] magemaster225: yeah
[4:37:30] Demanisraar: cata
[4:37:33] xEskii: 100% mop for the new one
[4:37:36] Dkgungo: like when za and zg came out
[4:37:38] xziyn: Talents were MoP
[4:37:43] Weedz82: everything changed with Cata
[4:37:44] magemaster225: cata had a pruned vanilla tree
[4:37:50] KatieGaming: idk how u guys remember that shit lol
[4:37:54] cliche_cat: bro they are gaslighting you, it was cata
[4:37:57] Snabido: You had to pick a spec in cata, reach the points needed and then put points in another spec
[4:38:05] Snabido: If wanted
[4:38:20] reggiepowa: 5.0
[4:38:21] nightmayor12: panda pre patch yeah
[4:38:29] Rinizon: mop pre patch
[4:38:34] 3663Sharad: @KatieGaming Hive mind or googled very fast xD
[4:38:41] jmalmin: Actually something people do not remember. Naxx as the expansion first raid. it was clearled so fast and it tok a long time before Uduar showed up and first then the raiding got good. Except for the "double Jarmanger worms" in the collusem raid which was a bad raid.  They had two amazing raids in Wraith and 4 that was not that great.
[4:38:41] MILESkg21: it has been like 10 years
[4:38:52] KatieGaming: true @3663Sharad LUL
[4:39:00] magemaster225: its ok, dragonsoul had peoples brains scrambled
[4:39:15] GameingAspect: trail of crusade was dope
[4:39:24] xziyn: Anuub HM was dope though
[4:39:24] tomcruise210: malygos is a badass fight 󠀀 󠀀
[4:39:25] Dkgungo: they should give us a heroic version of naxx
[4:39:25] Kainiee: sarth3d was good and malygos was ok
[4:39:37] megaxbrain: i really thought the undying/immortal titles from naxx were a pretty cool achievement
[4:39:37] PrisheBurningBlade: ToGC was peak raid trash design, best trash of any raid ever made and its not close
[4:39:46] 91Niki: @KatieGaming I can't remember what I had for dinner last night, but I'll remember some random useless fact in a video game from 10 years ago LUL
[4:39:50] xziyn: The heal mechanic on Anuub was crazy at the time
[4:39:53] mavericks312: difference is there was what 3 raids in base wrath
[4:39:54] Thunderbrew: Hopefully 10.0 will be the greatest expansion of all time.
[4:39:57] TigbittiesXXL: dragonsoul was like a year if i remember lol
[4:40:06] tomcruise210: just like og game...in wrath classic i can finally do naxx lol  󠀀 󠀀
[4:40:06] KatieGaming: LUL i sometimes can too but like thats TOO far back hahah @91Niki
[4:40:12] MisterRonB: Yup, the only positive thing in Trial of the Crusader's favor was the trash mob design.
[4:40:24] MILESkg21: @91Niki same KEKW
[4:40:32] 91Niki: @KatieGaming I can legit remember dreams I had over 15 years ago, don't ask me why KEKW
[4:40:37] KombatWombat07: SL 1 year drought poggers
[4:40:40] KatieGaming: @91Niki LUL
[4:40:45] tomcruise210: that phase 1 is the perfect time to level alts lol while you raid log naxx  󠀀 󠀀
[4:40:49] Snabido: No trash Kreygasm
[4:40:53] gooseboy429: all bosses no trash
[4:41:00] PrisheBurningBlade: I liked it, and no trash was thebest part
[4:41:05] swordart2022: called trail for reason
[4:41:12] MILESkg21: TOC was perfect
[4:41:12] luckfore: i hope the wrath stuff doesnt overshadow the new expac
[4:41:15] HaxzorJimDuggan: maybe thats why FF14 calls them... Trials Kappa
[4:41:16] trivotix: lol the pvp part. That was amazing
[4:41:20] tomcruise210: sepulcher trash pepeP
[4:41:26] BelacKriv: only anub was good tho
[4:41:27] GameingAspect: rember the blizard fun time raid with hogger at the end?
[4:41:36] tomcruise210: nyalotha trash pepeP 󠀀 󠀀
[4:41:36] jmalmin: Tempest Keep trash is still the worst :)
[4:41:37] manmower: 11 bosses and tons of trash
[4:41:41] swordart2022: if you cant kill trash you cant kill boss.
[4:41:42] 91Niki: @KatieGaming And I can walk to the kitchen to grab my vitamins, and come back without them cuz i forgot on the way there KEKW Make it make sense
[4:41:46] ArcaneLight: i like trash in raids BBYodaS
[4:41:58] nightmayor12: trash is important for a raid environment though
[4:41:59] fred_birkhoff: I enjoy getting stoned tho
[4:42:02] KatieGaming: @91Niki LUL i do that shit too haha
[4:42:22] Apokolipz: all the soul pouring into shadowlands are actually murlocs we the players keeps killing lol

[4:42:47] nightmayor12: Nyalotha the walking* city
[4:43:00] xhaven: I do like the trash in raids though, makes sense from story sense that its not just 10,11,12 bosses alone
[4:43:03] KatieGaming: @91Niki LUL
[4:43:20] KatieGaming: thats exactly what its like haha
[4:43:22] BoezIRL: only bm can do it

[4:44:46] theANGRYcasual: BM got that unique privalege
[4:44:53] KatieGaming: @BadinfluenceTV he has not
[4:44:53] zilzihan: It is literally called Beast Mastery
[4:44:55] Ezcotli: extinct
[4:44:55] Celestia6: It's a special BM talent
[4:44:56] Snabido: BM has this exotic thing going on, you know, special snowflakes Kappa

[4:45:10] 3663Sharad: YEP
[4:45:12] Malfleur: Exactly that
[4:45:14] jmalmin: I am unsure if your able to tame the undead version of a devil saur as a survival hunter. or if you need to be a BM for that too.
[4:45:19] Taz_85: devilsaurs, trikes, etc
[4:45:24] PrisheBurningBlade: "ya'll have phones right" "You think you do but you dont" "Pruning" "Corgi Form for Vupera"

[4:46:24] tomcruise210: i got to 50 in 17hrs played the last time i leveled 󠀀 󠀀
[4:46:42] 3663Sharad: If you dont read quest text sure
[4:46:47] GameingAspect: wat fastest leveler ever?
[4:46:50] tomcruise210: did nothing but BFA leveling zones
[4:46:54] papascruge: longer is good if the story is good
[4:47:01] theANGRYcasual: WOD leveling was lit
[4:47:03] reggiepowa: I usually get to 50 in around 10 hours and then 15-16 to 60 with threads
[4:47:03] SilkeySmooth: they got to get you in to the store much faster
[4:47:04] KatieGaming: i dont mind leveling so i agree
[4:47:06] akia03: @aspectwhildfire 6 or 7 hours
[4:47:11] reggiepowa: total
[4:47:14] Celestia6: agreed
[4:47:38] Egzolinas: When you read the quests, I think it is not that fast :)
[4:47:40] jmalmin: What I do find interesting is the talk about that they will maybe remove leveling and maybe add a Mastery system like you find in ESO.
[4:47:42] darssia_: i didn't like the sl leveling zones so I thought it took too long.
[4:47:44] zeitgeiz: I feel like leveling 1-50 isn’t an issue for casuals now. Even 50-60 is good with all the QoL changes

[5:08:07] Collected1: be here for the best announcement party on twitch
[5:08:51] brentosxd: @Towelliee thought on Evoker class leak?

[5:09:13] KyleEverett: I feel so old. April 12th marked the 7th anniversary of the WoW Token
[5:09:18] MILESkg21: what leak
[5:09:32] brentosxd: red shirt guy talked about it on twitter
[5:09:50] Kisswani: " Blizzard time gating expansion release " Kappa
[5:09:59] Collected1: guessing yes
[5:10:03] pseudomenudo: havent played since denathrius kill whats changed
[5:10:08] Collected1: Tali didn't believe a word of it
[5:10:09] Taz_85: Mages already evoke. Wouldn't read into that particular leak much
[5:10:13] TacDuc: If next expansion has a quest the I'm quitting, it gets way too repetitive with quests since 2004
[5:10:24] Taz_85: Like the people begging for necromancer.
[5:10:29] Snabido: Know for a fact we're going to be doing dungeons and raids, and kill a shit ton of mobs for loot PogChamp
[5:10:35] Collected1: he was commenting on a "leak" on MMOC
[5:10:44] mavericks312: evoker is a fancy name for amage
[5:10:48] KyleEverett: Nah, it's regarding the MMO-C speculation/leak thread. Some guy who predicted key points of Legion is doing stuff about Dragonflight. Key things are Evoker class tied to dragons, and Drac'thyr as the race.
[5:11:02] Kisswani: yeah Evoker is like a british mage Kappa
[5:11:30] manmower: dragon race that lets you do dragon flight form and human form? everyone would race swap
[5:11:32] jazzl3: ahh the motherlode makes me miss 8.3 mythic+
[5:11:52] jmalmin: Have there been a Evoker in wow? anyone at all that has called themself a Evoker? If not then its not coming.
[5:11:53] KyleEverett: @manmower My favorite theory is that since Elves mutate to magic so easily, it'll be Dragon Elves
[5:12:02] KyleEverett: @jmalmin Just the RPG
[5:12:10] Durras2000: Durras2000 subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 42 months! 
[5:12:20] MILESkg21: havent had a healer since MOP 4Head
[5:12:23] swordart2022: It sounds like mage
[5:12:24] dysar5150: dps/heal?
[5:12:25] PvtHudson093: the new classs needs to be a mail wearing class
[5:12:28] Bwyllin_: It'd be something with dragon/draconic in the name imo
[5:12:29] Quojin: healer i would imagine
[5:12:30] nightmayor12: do we really need a new class to add to the 12 we already have?
[5:12:31] Kisswani: it has to be ranged tho , we haven't had a new range class in ... maybe ever ?
[5:12:31] manmower: or give everyone dragon flight form with aspects, except druids of course
[5:12:43] nightmayor12: there are 36 specs in the game how much more choice do we need
[5:12:50] KyleEverett: Oh I am praying for Earthwarder tank, Chronomancer healer, and as a twist, Lifebinder as a firery DPS
[5:13:02] MILESkg21: KEKW
[5:13:04] swordart2022: Pog
[5:13:04] oneifbyland: quit leaking the script Kappa
[5:13:05] manmower: choose the color of your wings!
[5:13:06] Taz_85: Earthwarder tank idea is badass
[5:13:06] Demanisraar: HE KNOWS
[5:13:08] Kisswani: KEKW
[5:13:17] Merex760: Hoping for a ranger dps of some sort. We haven’t gotten a new one of those since WoW launch
[5:13:21] Demanisraar: KEKW
[5:13:23] Merex760: Ranged*
[5:13:33] rafael_g_amaral: HE KNOWS
[5:13:35] DeanoTV: @Merex760 yep mail wearer
[5:13:36] KyleEverett: As sad as it'd make me seeing Earthwarder go to a class that's not shaman, I'll take it in any form.
[5:13:44] Etherdon: Apotheosis Warlock for tanking would be nice. They almost had it.
[5:13:44] manmower: there are real people who think they are dragon people, they're gonna love this xpac
[5:13:46] MILESkg21: Dark Ranger monkaS
[5:13:47] TacDuc: If they make us pick something like a covenant, then just let us pick the abilities ourselves and mogs and questline changes from the different covenants
[5:13:49] Taz_85: It is
[5:13:51] Broomba: towOny towOny towOny towOny towOny towOny towOny
[5:13:51] abracka_: shaman tank earthwarder
[5:13:52] Taz_85: Shaman tank spec
[5:13:57] Taz_85: Chucking rocks and dirt at ya
[5:13:57] jmalmin: I am still hopefull for a Tinker. I want my mech class :)
[5:14:22] chintzypop: I’d like to see a new tank/healer class
[5:14:22] Farmerjag: do i come back for retail or just wait for wotlk?

[5:14:25] manmower: imagine balancing that
[5:14:29] Malnar1123: they dont even want to add a talent row no way they adding more classes
[5:14:32] tamer_bayne: does anyone know when the glaiver ( lancemaster ) comes out is it thursday or tuesday ?
[5:14:35] KyleEverett: No, I'm thinking if Evoker is real it'll be tied to the flights and only black makes sense as a tank spc.
[5:14:36] Aidler: I’m getting some GFuel Stonks today
[5:14:42] MILESkg21: WutFace
[5:14:43] Kisswani: WutFace
[5:14:44] Reckless_Monk: HUH ???
[5:14:45] Alllprimer: SeemsGood
[5:14:46] stallowned: D:
[5:14:47] FatChase: Druids crying at their 5th spec KEKW
[5:14:47] Demanisraar: KEKW
[5:14:49] kashmara: tf did I come back to
[5:14:53] Taz_85: Maybe just as a cosmetic thing, to give different specs more aesthetics, instead of new specs all together. There was a big fanmade post about that.
[5:14:54] airmeez: hahahahaha
[5:14:54] VictorLowes: D:
[5:14:56] chopsaki: what are we paying sub money for then?? do your @#$# job bliz
[5:14:57] Fubarlogixx: wtf lol
[5:15:00] Taz_85: Tauren paladins having that ''sunwalker'' theme, etc
[5:15:01] darssia_: didn't gw2 just do that?
[5:15:12] Velashen: The concept of balance in an MMO is impossible. Adding specs would be fine.
[5:15:46] MILESkg21: Convoke
[5:15:48] oneifbyland: convoke
[5:15:49] Magnarius: convocque
[5:15:49] TacDuc: Convoke the spirits
[5:15:49] nightmayor12: convoke
[5:15:50] Sicknessqt: convoke?
[5:15:55] Magnarius: convoke sorry
[5:16:08] Kisswani: KEKW
[5:16:13] Kisswani: what was that LUL
[5:16:14] jarveess: LUL
[5:16:19] Balkidar: Its not even the classes. Its all the external, slap-on borrowed power
[5:16:25] KyleEverett: Are any of the druids besides Feral currently Fae?
[5:16:41] Mockle: convoke was stupid at first
[5:17:09] TacDuc: Who would have thought that using around 40 million different abilities would be OP
[5:17:10] Vashile: he's still under his 17hr limit?
[5:17:11] Velashen: @theridar Agreed. More classes would never be an issue without all of these crazy systems.
[5:17:11] KyleEverett: I'm praying that they just make a single ability per spec in 10.0 rather than giving us "false" choices like covenants.
[5:17:22] brentosxd: Class skins was a cool leak and would give a ''new feel to current classes'' without the balancing aspect
[5:17:22] oneifbyland: new class with 2 or 3 specs? nah, let's do TWELVE lol
[5:17:25] KragnosWoW: adding another spec would only bring in more players, i dont see any negatives
[5:17:41] swordart2022: @KyleEverett dude stop if your goal si always min max you dotn care what you pick already
[5:17:45] Longiboi: Personally i would like another legion type rework. Not whole class but maybe a spec each
[5:17:56] Farmerjag: is there any situation you see where a classic type warcraft takes over retail? classic plus, som, etc
[5:18:01] Velashen: they were afraid to balance the covenants because they wanted it to feel permanent and meaningful. They shot themselves in the foot not able to balance
[5:18:13] KyleEverett: @fairplay2021 I don't min max, it just feels bad if you like an ability more but you get a lot of drama wanting to use it.
[5:18:15] DeanoTV: new class - ranger, mail wearer with 2 specs dps and heal
[5:18:16] MILESkg21: not looking for another penalty for my choice KEKW
[5:18:17] Taz_85: We becoming the leader of the dragonflights? PogChamp
[5:18:27] Taz_85: for one expansion
[5:18:27] Moobot: World of Wacraft 10.0 Expansion LEAKED ON MAIN SITE! Could be deflection? Mebbe? THRE BE DRAGONS! https://www.wowhead.com/news/world-of-warcraft-dragonflight-expansion-leaks-on-blizzard-website-326583 We are doing a 24 stream for the expansion announcement. Be here!
[5:18:31] Kisswani: to be fair , Ashen was cool
[5:18:42] manmower: i'd rather have more gear with abilities like conduits had rather than that covenant stuff
[5:18:46] HilariousMax: But there's always going to be a single "optimal" build
[5:19:00] TacDuc: @DeanoTV Must be a halfcaster
[5:19:24] KragnosWoW: it usually takes a whole expansion to make everything useful
[5:19:37] swordart2022: @KyleEverett what a nonsense lul
[5:19:37] lithium364: im sure 10.3 will fix everything
[5:19:47] Kisswani: first item on the bingo sheet gotta be Player Housing
[5:19:54] Dackor: If Soulbinds were purely for open-world content, like much better version of WoD bodyguards or Nazjatar followers, then people wouldnt have an issue tbh
[5:19:57] KragnosWoW: @lithium364 COPIUM
[5:19:58] Domini1001: @Towelliee  yea nightfae was OP in beta for SL so they kinda left it
[5:20:02] ijuki: @DeanoTV Rather, 1 dps and 1 heal spec, like DH
[5:20:12] Snabido: You want to troll the haters with that 😏
[5:20:18] HilariousMax: need a mail tank
[5:20:25] Reign_69: I think they should uncap all specs, I think they should also make everyone’s single target damage and aoe damage fairy close that way it’s easier to balance and it allows someone to be good at a spec/class to try different builds and to do higher damage
[5:20:40] brentosxd: How silly is it that blizzard leaks their own expansio name on their site unless its a bait
[5:20:40] jarveess: haven`t played for 6 months, it s worth cominb back now, or should i wait for next expansion?
[5:20:41] swordart2022: these chat takes time to hide it xD
[5:20:48] KyleEverett: @fairplay2021 you go into a key right now as fae ret or necro balance and see how much your group likes you haha
[5:20:59] KragnosWoW: I dont think another tank class would solve anything
[5:21:33] OxidTV: Need another healer/rang dps class
[5:21:33] KyleEverett: I love tanks and healers, I'll always take more variety there
[5:22:00] trivotix: @OxidTV Completely agree
[5:22:00] HilariousMax: who's looking to solve anything. It's a hole in the armor class/spec allowance
[5:22:17] billybaggens: need more range classes all together
[5:22:30] KyleEverett: Sandy time healer and earth/molten tank would be unique aesthetics compared to the rest.
[5:23:02] KragnosWoW: warrior tanks got no love
[5:23:03] ScriptzSB: Prot Warr :(
[5:23:13] ijuki: F prot warrior
[5:23:15] Kisswani: The first time I saw a prot warrior was in the MDI trailer KEKW
[5:23:15] KyleEverett: Warrior is paying for it's sins in BfA
[5:23:24] KragnosWoW: red headed step child of tanks KEKW
[5:24:04] HilariousMax: does the MK2 drop in regular?
[5:24:17] chrslp: I cant wait to pick up my dog tomorrow FeelsGoodMan Been a week without my buddy D:
[5:24:33] VictorLowes: sick?
[5:24:55] Alllprimer: @chrslp awesome towHAMUP
[5:25:13] chrslp: Sometimes you need a break from you dog but man you still miss the fucker
[5:25:41] sinlesssinner: question for everyone plz, Do the Legion timewalking mythic+ dungeons add to your mythic+ rating?
[5:25:44] KyleEverett: Who needs rework at this point?
[5:25:49] ijuki: Holy paladin needs a new mastery... badly
[5:25:51] just_ie: I mean its obviously enhance shaman, they do it every expansion
[5:25:59] manmower: shadowpriest gameplay needs to be addressed again
[5:26:01] Magnarius: monk dps need love
[5:26:03] KyleEverett: Bear works so well though
[5:26:07] xhaven: no please leave my bear tank

[5:26:21] KyleEverett: Well it's propped up by UFR and 4p, but yeah
[5:26:22] HilariousMax: Isn't that evergreen? We always want to see bear tanks either brought down or made less boring?
[5:26:24] xziyn: Feral def needs help

[5:26:46] MVRD: frost dk as example is absolutely amazing currently - no need to change it at all 󠀀

[5:32:42] KragnosWoW: give priests or paladins a battle mas res like anduin in the cinematic for bfa
[5:32:44] Balkidar: Give bears something ridiculous like Rampage LUL
[5:32:48] Kisswani: maybe a sort of " consecration " like ability where they usitilize the earth or some shit
[5:32:57] Kragz2307: wow
[5:33:00] Etherdon: They should give WoW a Carbot mod like they did Starcraft.
[5:33:09] Reign_69: I think they should give prot warrior an animation like the Spartans had, where they shield their allies with a big shield around them

[5:35:38] UltiCarnagee: Mass Spell Reflect Pog
[5:35:54] manmower: using rage to apply temporary buffs on warrior is boring
[5:35:55] KragnosWoW: agreed, warriors seem very basic and underwhelming
[5:35:59] lithium364: everytime prot owns thunder clap is highest damage
[5:36:12] magemaster225: just need better visuals.  like flashy avatar things

[5:37:42] manmower: Fury and Arms could be the same spec, one talent for dual wield vs single weapon
[5:37:47] Lupine_Fury: that taking into account microphone BS ?
[5:37:49] Reign_69: They should just add stances back, just like the old blessings on pala

[5:46:51] DeanoTV: prot pala/DH easy aoe tank
[5:47:07] lithium364: healer always gets flamed even if dps or tank did something wrong
[5:47:33] rhetoric80: "Tank's worst enemy is hesitation." ... that is the TRUTH.
[5:47:33] Kisswani: I bought 3 token for gold , now I got 40 euros in bnet balance . should be good for the basic expansion version
[5:47:42] Reign_69: Gotta know your defensives and self heals too and judge them on pulls/situations
[5:47:42] Fubarlogixx: gotta have that big dick energy lmao
[5:47:43] Jewishraver: just from main tanking so much that even as dps im watching the group at all times and making sure mobs stay off my healer
[5:47:53] Dkgungo: there is also a big difference between a average tank and a good tank
[5:48:02] scarfius: totally disagree
[5:48:10] gidgeet: I am the over healer
[5:48:17] swordart2022: true
[5:48:18] MyJoyStick: @Towelliee or they overheal when the healing isn't needed, then they don't have CD's when they are needed.
[5:48:18] fred_birkhoff: lol why do you disagree? @scarfius
[5:48:26] jak_gaming: a lot of the come from practice
[5:48:28] Dkgungo: panic healers dont know how to use there cooldowns lol

[5:49:04] Malnar1123: Tank every mythix 0 then every +2 then everything 3-5. then everything 6-10....etc. By the time you get to 15's you'll know the ins and outs of your class and every dungeon..dont try to just skip to 10s all because you may have the gear for it
[5:49:07] manmower: just start kiting
[5:49:17] scarfius: i wanted to reply to the guy that said that tank is the easieast spec of the game, but stupid tiwtch reply system never got the thread XD
[5:49:23] Reign_69: A good tank knows Self healing, and when to use defensives, and Cds

[5:50:29] xziyn: Melee DPS is MUCH harder than tanks
[5:50:35] shaxxtv: healer is the hardest role imo....
[5:50:55] manmower: the funniest players are the ones who rage and link interrupt logs lol
[5:51:02] MyJoyStick: @shaxxtv I agree
[5:51:03] Reign_69: Healer is the hardest roll, totally agree
[5:51:10] jaysteea: yep the min max of dps
[5:51:15] pereadin: HEALERS ARE EASY CHAT BE QUIET
[5:51:19] GameingAspect: kiteing them out of there aoer they lose there shit

[5:51:27] leroyblinkintv: man, fuck i miss wildstar
[5:51:39] shaxxtv: as a healer you wanna see how little you need to heal so you can push more dmg :P
[5:51:39] Bryan2874: what happened to wildstar?
[5:51:42] Malnar1123: Healer and Tank is the hardest role until you learn the mechanics, mobs, routes, etc. Then it's pretty simple...at that level is when DPS starts to matter more
[5:51:44] MyJoyStick: @pereadin everything is easy to be fair, it's only WoW. But Healer is the most difficult for sure.
[5:51:47] Malfleur: I loved it how you get instant friend requests as dps if you use interrupts and soothes XD
[5:51:48] Reign_69: In M+ it triggers me when ints don't go out
[5:51:48] KatieGaming: wildstar :(
[5:51:48] stallowned: haha wildstar made me a fkin pro at interupts in wow
[5:52:01] Malfleur: As if this is something no one does
[5:52:16] ijuki: @pereadin POGGERS
[5:52:34] manmower: wow has cast bars on things you can't interrupt now, which is strange
[5:52:52] ijuki: Well, better to interrupt than not doing it at all
[5:53:02] swordart2022: @manmower use stun/move other cc
[5:53:16] akia03: interupts are for tanks dps got beter things to do :)
[5:53:18] lithium364: New wow UI for 10.0
