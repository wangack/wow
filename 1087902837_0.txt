[1:14:49] CritcobainTV: If they can get kills on the next two in a decent time they'll be pretty much on par with echo, since echo hasn't done splits
[1:15:03] Brodih_: its because its not a gear check fight, its execution

[1:22:15] Brenndon: Possible but i doubt it, it's 2 am here over in EU
[1:22:48] visaeris412: @Critcobain wouldnt that mean they are behind? not to mention echo has spent a day less in the raid? echo has killed 2 more bosses than limit without doing splits

[1:23:09] Brenndon: but they turned off streams around like 23.30 i believe.
[1:23:29] CritcobainTV: @visaeris412 but they still hav eto take the time to do the splits, which is a solid 8-10 hours of work. So if limit DOES catch up to them, they're basically at the same point since echo has to put that time in
[1:23:51] Brenndon: That is if they ahve to do splits
[1:24:03] Brenndon: who knows the other bosses are able to be done without splits
[1:24:21] CritcobainTV: I don't recall a RWF where a guild didn't need to do splits at some point

[2:38:39] Moronil: It's a sandbox mmo tho, ff has a lot of non power leveling systems
[2:38:53] Sollice: WoW seems to have been complex, simplified, complex, trying to simply again. They lack a clear this is our game this is how we do it. I actually think they are trying to cater too much to the fans just reading us wrong

[2:39:03] Secondbreakfasttt: shard drops are terrible tho
[2:39:08] rilsolo: yes but they should be an afterthought of classes/raids and dungeons/ pvp shouldn't be the main focus of each xpac i feel
[2:39:16] Velashen: @Sollice Yeah it has been all over the place for years.
[2:39:21] CritcobainTV: this domination shard system is shit. It's RNG on top of RNG. gotta hope you get the gear with sockets, then you have to hope you get the right shards to put in them. its awful
[2:39:25] Noobicron: just give us set bonuses again

[2:40:17] MackPlays: Is now a good time to get back into WoW? I haven‚Äôt played since mop
[2:40:22] rilsolo: i wouldn't mind the systems if they didn't make classes fun, if classes were fun by themselves and the system adds to it im all for it
[2:40:23] griffdog125: we want meaningful choices lmao
[2:40:27] Lonely_piggy_: I just want better lore stuff.
[2:40:28] Sollice: Well everyone wants good content lol. Although I am sure there is some shitter out there who wants poor content
[2:40:37] Velashen: Well the issue is that once a good system is in place it is scrapped the next expansion.
[2:40:43] byrdeen45: Just give me my Tinker class
[2:40:43] Noobicron: 8 pc set bonuses class themed, thats all we need
[2:40:52] Lonely_piggy_: Any predictions? @Towelliee
[2:40:54] Bakuryuha96: @boomeranng125 and whats a meaningful choice?
[2:41:18] Sollice: I think the Shadowlands story is hitting the mark. I have maintained 9. is going to hopefully lead in to a massive 10. expansion
[2:41:21] mavericks312: they will get called lazy if they use the same systems
[2:41:30] griffdog125: @Bakuryuha96 lol i was just kidding
[2:41:34] TheCliffyShow: Some people wanna watch the World (of Warcraft) burn.
[2:41:37] zaechil: "It's Shit ! " "yeah, but it's a NEW shit!"
[2:41:42] JesikaPlays: all you would hear about would be "boooring"
[2:41:42] xaragorn078: im happy with wow 9.1
[2:41:52] Drxhor: Should have kept GARRISONS
[2:42:05] zSKIz1: how do we know people will be upset if they keep a system though?
[2:42:13] zSKIz1: they seem to just keep making new ones and everyone assumes that
[2:42:18] Noobicron: i can see your nose hairs, thats a damn good camera
[2:42:21] knoxxxed: I think if 9.1 came out like 4 months sooner, noone would complain as much
[2:42:55] Sollice: @Drxhor WoW not having individual housing, unless there is some sort of a engine issue or something, is a huge missed opportunity.
[2:43:04] bantuatha: Revenge of the eye?
[2:43:08] rilsolo: just memorize the path
[2:43:13] TheCliffyShow: Blizzard should just be like, "Fuck it! Let's just do what we want. They gonna bitch either way.
[2:43:18] Velashen: I'd still play with the garrison if it got an occasional content update though. That is the thing. Lots of wasted R&D leaving everything behind and irrelevant.

[2:44:11] Ponas91: why not find some system that works and stick with it? how many of the 7-8 systems that weve had have actually worked?
[2:44:15] Sollice: Odin can't not have an eye patch. Eye patch=Odin
[2:44:18] Drxhor: @Sollice for sure
[2:44:20] loktar_ogars: toweliee are you surprised by the numbers that rwf is pulling? @Towelliee
[2:44:23] bantuatha: So you did beaten the eye?
[2:44:29] wildcat_19: where does wow story go in next expansion ?
[2:44:33] bantuatha: but how much struggle?
[2:44:39] TheCliffyShow: I just want Blizzard to give me player housing. And playable High Elves.
[2:44:40] loktar_ogars: without asmon
[2:44:42] bantuatha: @Towelliee I think there is a pet drop
[2:44:45] Velashen: @xaragorn078 Yeah but like I just said. If they updated it and kept it relevant people would mess with it.
[2:44:59] rilsolo: cuz it doesn't matter till slyvanas

[2:45:13] TheCliffyShow: People will flock in once someone gets to Sylvanas.
[2:45:41] Lonely_piggy_: Do you think there's a mythic-only Sylvanas cutscene, though? @Towelliee
[2:45:45] loktar_ogars: i mean limit max got like 100k viewers
[2:45:51] loktar_ogars: on day 1

[2:47:11] mavericks312: where is the super guild aster
[2:47:27] Sollice: @Towelliee Is Max in your raid MM or BM?
