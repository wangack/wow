[2:09:38] Darthyrevan: Summer 2023
[2:09:53] szble: i wonder if we get a new class they'll be playable in s4

[2:10:32] raye_gaming22: new class for preorder mark it
[2:10:38] raye_gaming22: like they did with DH
[2:10:40] Dagomarus: Season 4 will probably end up being around 300 Ilvl
[2:10:44] xXSiebzehnXx: Good morning towHAMUP
[2:10:56] zigzugg: pre patch
[2:11:06] wEiRdO_dUdE: I think the new class would be with the new expansion, if one happens
[2:11:33] Scoodles91: best case scenario, you get something new on pre patch
[2:11:35] Dagomarus: Its been ages since a new class, i think it could be time for one
[2:11:38] wEiRdO_dUdE: A new class would be great, but they would use it to sell more copies
[2:11:38] Scoodles91: if its in the expansion
[2:11:44] mrniceguy817: mrniceguy817 subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 24 months! 
[2:11:45] Schamanskii: that´s sad that they can´t even release a new class
[2:11:56] raye_gaming22: 8 years with no class its about time
[2:12:04] abracka_: would rather see a new spec or some shit for each current class than a whole new class
[2:12:24] jerseyfive: season 4 ? you mean I have to equip my chars again Pepehand
[2:12:26] LUKA_THIM: they dont wanna work on balancing
[2:12:36] Delicer1994: Worst WoD Dungeon LUL
[2:12:37] Aidler: aren’t there more important things than a new class?
[2:12:48] wEiRdO_dUdE: New specs, reworked specs....those can give a similar experience to a new class
[2:12:51] Dagomarus: have we ever went 3 expansions without a new class
[2:13:23] Reinkaos999: I still dont have a demon hunter
[2:13:23] szble: the dreaded T word
[2:13:31] KragnosWoW: they need to go back to making classes more unique before adding another one
[2:13:39] Sicknessqt: not Tinker for sure KEKW
[2:13:51] jerseyfive: lets delete monks and demon hunters HYPERS
[2:13:53] Komly: why do we have to have either/or? why cant they just introduce a new class(yes because its fun) and work on other things that need improving?
[2:14:03] R2RHIN0: I'd rather them focus on the general game experience than a new class. They can barely balance the classes we have now

[2:14:30] Alaquane: wod walking week?
[2:14:31] Niksen_99: So true @Komly
[2:14:31] Moobot: Towelliee is playing on Server US EAST - UNA for Lost Ark!

[2:15:13] Thoreya: give us good gameplay and new classs
[2:15:16] Thoreya: idc about story
[2:15:45] captiv8: class in number 1 on my list
[2:15:47] akia03: what kinda class can they add that wow already doesnt have
[2:15:51] Velashen: No reason they can’t do both.
[2:16:10] Thunderbrew: They can't balance the classes they have.
[2:16:14] Thoreya: can definitely use another ranged class
[2:16:16] Alaquane: split all specs into individual classes rescDevil
[2:16:18] mrniceguy817: ^
[2:16:27] mrniceguy817: Please no more classes they can’t balance what they have
[2:16:29] FannyPackGirl: i want a class with triple jump or i walk
[2:16:37] szble: perfect class balance doesn't exist
[2:16:40] wEiRdO_dUdE: The speculation has talked about a tinkerer class, or some kind of dragon thing
[2:16:46] mobbo: If they add anything other than a full time ranged DPS class to the game then they shouldn’t add one
[2:16:48] captiv8: i want a new class for fun.....
[2:16:49] abracka_: so bear looks a lil overpowered. swipe to win
[2:16:55] raye_gaming22: we need another mail range class
[2:16:56] Thoreya: yeah lets not make a new class to strive for perfect balance in a game thats never happened before
[2:17:02] nevercluckyy: is there any way to get werebear forms now?
[2:17:07] akia03: isnt tinker just ranged hunter with no pets gun and bombs
[2:17:08] Thoreya: literally a fantasy world if u think were ever gonna have perfect balance
[2:17:12] wEiRdO_dUdE: Sure, having a little goblin or gnome that can jump into a mechashredder on cooldown would be badass
[2:17:18] mrniceguy817: @szble No one’s looking for perfect but remotely close would be nice
[2:17:38] Thoreya: what classes are broken rn?

[2:17:47] Alaquane: people have wanted Tinker since wow beta because it was a WC3 neutral hero
[2:17:48] mobbo: @towelliee maybe mage tower is reason for long maintenance window
[2:17:49] Saphirosa_Dragonaspect: they need to adjust mage tower so you dont have to farm MoP content to do it easily
[2:18:24] nevercluckyy: i would 100% main bear tank but i cant stand the regular bear forms
[2:18:25] Colt_Engineer: RAPID FIRE!!!
[2:18:40] BobLongMVP: @alaquane that hype mostly went away after they stopped doing “hero classes” imagine if they added all the neural hero’s haha
[2:18:41] 3663Sharad: Maybe we will get some new subclasses as a new system,
[2:18:53] wEiRdO_dUdE: I would like to see more mage tower changes, but I think we're probably going to get exactly what we did last time
[2:18:55] 3663Sharad: Madge
[2:18:55] Colt_Engineer: KEKW
[2:18:58] PvtHudson093: "Fun"

[2:20:42] akia03: but trains
[2:20:47] Dathas487: Idk man thematically GRD slaps, I feel like it's worth seeing it in a m+ environment
[2:20:59] mobbo: Everbloom sucks
[2:20:59] Colt_Engineer: RAAAAAAA SKYREACH!!!
[2:21:03] isBadIRL: skyreach has annoying trash iirc
[2:21:04] KaisenSiru: Season 4 awkwHypedance wowgraMurChamp wowgraHype
[2:21:07] ChiefMango: These dungeons would be in addition to the current ones, yea? So we will have loads of m+ dungeons to do
[2:21:10] mmrghost7: that dung is a nightmare
[2:21:15] Armdel: everbloom is just gonna end up being people raging at others failing the skip
[2:21:32] akia03: which ones has the most op loot tho
[2:21:34] Alaquane: did they make timewalking hard again?

[2:34:50] faulen: Hey Towelliee, have not been around in awhile. Your mic sounds legit.
[2:35:00] flebbooo: Yeah super weird, litteraly no reason to not add a token to the jailer LUL
[2:35:19] Alexkayzz: Man I'm so excited for the april expansion reveal, but it's soooo far away still
[2:35:25] Armdel: i am not looking forward to trying to pug the last 3 bosses of this raid
[2:35:34] Korupcija_: mmo players are rewards oriented, they might figure it out after 20 years
[2:35:39] N3llee: @Towelliee Know if Lore has announced his future plans by chance?
[2:35:41] Korupcija_: I hope
[2:35:47] MammothGB: If they'd have given the jailer the chance to drop any tier, probably wouldn't have been anywhere near as splits
[2:35:55] MammothGB: near as many*
[2:35:59] mmrghost7: rygelon is a joke
[2:36:02] shiny_flaaffy: rygelon normal is so free its crazy
[2:36:06] KragnosWoW: feels like they dont want us to pug anymore
[2:36:06] zigzugg: just get the WA Kappa
[2:36:36] faulen: it does not
[2:36:40] Lynasz: world boss got chest piece :D
[2:36:41] wEiRdO_dUdE: The campaign gear is mostly greens, which I don't understand
[2:36:50] thegillthrill: Extended maintenance so they can push up the creation catalyst?  Kreygasm
[2:36:53] akia03: depends on armor type i think
[2:36:53] faulen: but you can buy one with the sand stone things
[2:37:05] Komly: do you already have a shadowsteel item equipped?
[2:37:09] Komly: you can buy a 262
[2:37:22] sinlesssinner: you dont got flying yet?
[2:37:26] Colt_Engineer: I'm still sad Johnny Cash left, that dude put a lot of my favorite stuff in the game
[2:37:27] lieutenantdan416: dont u get a chest piece as the very last item in the campaign?
[2:37:31] sinlesssinner: oh nvm its a quest :)
[2:37:50] KragnosWoW: ive been at 0 gold for 2 days on lost ark KEKW
[2:38:02] KragnosWoW: big oof
[2:38:18] Ariea_Whisper: You can buy the 233 crafted and wear that now in all slots @towelliee
[2:38:22] Colt_Engineer: yuge mount?
[2:38:24] Andr3ii: spider from new zone kinda cool
[2:38:47] CritcobainTV: AH
[2:38:49] zmasheytv: 262 crafted
[2:38:52] faulen: AH
[2:38:54] Scoodles91: normal craftet gear
[2:38:54] wEiRdO_dUdE: 233 crafted on the AH
[2:38:58] CritcobainTV: there's 233 crafted AH gear
[2:39:01] dysar5150: on ah cheap
[2:39:09] CritcobainTV: you can equip full 233 gear
[2:39:14] faulen: 233 AH crafted gear
[2:39:16] Scoodles91: you can be full 233
[2:39:16] FrankTizzle: He doesn't need 233 guys
[2:39:16] dysar5150: no 233 you can wear full
[2:39:21] R2RHIN0: there is a vendor at the main hub of zereath mortis who sells 226 gear in all slots for 500 anima each
[2:39:28] CritcobainTV: yes
[2:39:29] FrankTizzle: Yes
[2:39:30] mobbo: You can only wear 1 262
[2:39:33] Scoodles91: yes
[2:39:33] faulen: yes, they are
[2:39:35] dysar5150: different gear
[2:39:36] mobbo: You can wear full 233
[2:39:37] sakura_2020: you can buy the 233 chest piece on the AH
[2:39:41] Clicklesly: There's really not much difference between 233 and 226 though ^^
[2:39:46] SamAddams: 233 is the new 200 base gear. Non-unique
[2:39:47] mobbo: Yes
[2:39:57] Ariea_Whisper: The 262 is only one you can wear the 233 now they removed the restriction for the 233
[2:40:48] SamAddams: Yeah the 233’s are dirt cheap on AH
[2:41:16] wEiRdO_dUdE: That 4 piece for blood DK is sick
[2:41:21] mmrghost7: 4 p is great with nightfae
[2:41:30] CritcobainTV: did you get the 50% increase cypher thing?
[2:41:38] wEiRdO_dUdE: I heard dudes talking about 80% uptime on dancing rune weapons
[2:41:52] scottb0tt: The 2piece is where most of the power comes from, kinda nice
[2:42:06] mrniceguy817: How many more rounds of buffs before prot war is a solid choice I wonder
[2:42:23] Yosbo: the new xpack better have good story telling considering how much of a let down the ending of shadowlands is , the jailer who influenced multiple expansions dies like this and turns into a robot xD  if anything he should have opened a portal when weakend and left us to wonder where he went and if he ever comes back
[2:42:54] Eithos87: @Towelliee did you get any info on why the maintenance is 8 hours?
[2:43:09] KragnosWoW: yeah in season 4 KEKW
[2:43:10] Birder_L: ohno
[2:43:29] R2RHIN0: towTinfoil towTinfoil towTinfoil towTinfoil

[2:44:00] CritcobainTV: KEKW
[2:44:02] Kickack: work day patch day
[2:44:24] abracka_: pray we get creation catalyst because of the long window
[2:44:36] Eithos87: @Agk90_ in 2 weeks
[2:44:38] Gingerprimer: @abracka_ copium
[2:44:44] mrniceguy817: Last patch with that time frame was up in half the time
[2:44:56] Thoreya: id be so happy
[2:44:56] KragnosWoW: that would be so amazing
[2:44:59] KragnosWoW: i wish they do that
[2:45:09] mobbo: Probably Mage tower shit
[2:45:14] KaisenSiru: Method Pog
[2:45:20] N3llee: how close was liquid yesterday?
[2:45:23] mobbo: Making sure it works with 9.2 etc
[2:45:39] KaisenSiru: Liquid didnt even beat their last best two days ago
[2:45:43] mikoflex: What happened to liquid ?
[2:45:44] Alaquane: that man's face is visibly pained
[2:46:13] Thoreya: really? lol
[2:46:19] Thoreya: i didnt know they fucked with wow like that
[2:46:30] Saunt: thats because there are 100 times more of them
[2:46:51] ContraRob: Does liquid have a P4 pull yet?
[2:47:02] faulen: all the production people too.
[2:47:04] Gingerprimer: TBF they have a giant pop
[2:47:20] mikoflex: Did liquid give up?
[2:47:37] KragnosWoW: normal anduin almost broke me KEKW
[2:47:42] thiccsushi: Impartive looked like they had a rough start this tier too

[2:47:49] Novirtue_: To be fair halondrus was just stupid
[2:47:51] eyemyor: Liquid was just not up for it this tier
[2:47:52] Djfarmville: Didnt give up Copium
[2:48:02] CritcobainTV: It's not a gear issue tho
[2:48:06] eyemyor: And their casting was extremely lacking
[2:48:09] Novirtue_: Don't see casual mythic guilds getting past halondrus for at least 2 months
[2:48:16] Panasonic82: Liquid packed up and returned home after saturday, so they're raiding from home. Slightly different schedule
[2:48:26] Agk90_: Agk90_ is gifting 5 Tier 1 Subs to Towelliee's community! They've gifted a total of 30 in the channel!

[2:48:30] scottb0tt: liquid was in first place until the last 2 bosses
[2:48:33] Alaquane: Lula hard carrying preheat every morning
[2:48:44] giggz91: Method killed it?
[2:48:44] Moobot: Towelliee is playing on Server US EAST - UNA for Lost Ark!
[2:48:54] eyemyor: She was fine.  The rest, not so much.
[2:49:01] Carahail: Lula was the best part of my morning while it lasted
[2:49:03] boopbopbamski: wait liquid has yet to see P4 yet?
[2:49:29] Korupcija_: I like the dance in p3
[2:49:31] eyemyor: Echo has a lockdown on the casting trophy.  World first, that's still a race.
[2:49:44] Xytree: Xytree subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 2 months! 
[2:49:45] eyemyor: For ones in the future, that is
[2:49:50] KaisenSiru: wowgraMurChamp
[2:50:14] Korupcija_: doing these bosses without WA monkaS
[2:50:28] eyemyor: They missed a heal
[2:50:48] thiccsushi: F

[2:51:05] rantre208: f
[2:51:05] Alaquane: F
[2:51:05] morp1onz: Echo will get world second
[2:51:12] MrFuzzynuts420: being a team liquid fan is pain right now, it's like they gave up :(
[2:51:12] eyemyor: Method is doing great, considering the circumstances
[2:51:23] FrankTizzle: Can't wait for LFR Jailer Kappa
[2:51:32] CritcobainTV: i dont mind halondrus but im a dps an di didn't do mythic KEKW
[2:51:41] raye_gaming22: the holes are cringe for non mob classes
[2:51:45] FrankTizzle: There's no madness mechanic so LFR Jailer shouldn't be as troll Kappa
[2:52:04] eyemyor: Liquid was just physically and mentally exhausted, and their circumstances were just not going to allow them to keep it up
[2:52:08] mobbo: Sco just keeps rebuilding
[2:52:10] capricore: Prioritizing Mental Health over downing a boss is not giving up its smart
[2:52:18] Lintgamer: he said on stream that its hard to keep those hours. players already had to quit the game for school and stuff
[2:52:26] flebbooo: Gotta say i'm impressed Method managed to make this kinda comeback all things considered. Sco never gave up on it
[2:52:32] eyemyor: No shame in taking care of yourself
[2:53:01] Colt_Engineer: YIKES FOREVER
[2:53:06] MammothGB: Do you think there are other NA guilds that could step up to challenge that top spot conistently (BDGG didn't have a great tier) like Pieces & Method did this tier?
[2:53:12] eyemyor: Echo winning is no knock on Liquid.  Echo was better this time, so what.  Liquid was good, too.
[2:53:17] Thoreya: sco is 5head
[2:53:21] kroknows101: still regret not getting the paladin flail from the mage tower when current :(

[2:53:55] mneYEP: oh yes... Method known for making sponsors happy LUL
[2:54:04] Creative_Pigeon: what do  you think of the Bear nerfs to tier set?
[2:54:09] N3llee: @Towelliee do you think a 2nd or 3rd place for finish for liquid would hurt their sponsorship at all?
[2:54:13] Alaquane: Liquid prepared for a Marathon, not the Tour de France
[2:54:24] capricore: Can I go back in this new Mage tower and get the flail?

[2:55:00] FranciscoTheMage: who won? when?
[2:55:06] FranciscoTheMage: yesterday?
[2:55:09] Armdel: i was worried it was gg for echo when they looked so much worse on Halondrus
[2:55:13] caulpnrydc: echo on saturday
[2:55:19] Lynasz: Echo got better morale when they got LoD and Ryg
[2:55:27] ContraRob: @jmalmin When?
[2:55:29] eyemyor: I think Echo's way of prepping for the race and doing their splits was amazing.
[2:55:30] Thoreya: they smelt blood
[2:55:31] flebbooo: They just had that extra little EU sweat left in them KEKW
[2:55:37] Thoreya: bloood in the water
[2:55:45] Zippaya: Tbh, if Liquid keep playing, they would kill it day after for sure
[2:55:47] Sollice: Adrenaline...hell of a drug
[2:55:56] KaisenSiru: Liquid phone home!
[2:55:56] mobbo: Echo got woke
[2:55:57] MammothGB: at least Liquid should have Trill back for a few runs post-reset
[2:56:04] Colt_Engineer: work is temporary, world-first kill is forever
[2:56:08] mandarinetip: at least trill won awc :)
[2:56:08] eyemyor: Naowh went home, I think that was it for Echo
[2:56:11] CritcobainTV: I'm MVP it was my adderall FeelsGoodMan
[2:56:14] Lynasz: gotta be that ELX though kekw
[2:56:23] Minemanjoker: When they hit the secret phase it gave them the encouragement that it was possible to kill it and it was in their grasp.
[2:56:26] rohdey: LUL you know, i dont doubt that at all
[2:56:32] Korupcija_: I'm impressed how they barely got to 10% then the next day they had to stop dps lol
[2:56:34] eyemyor: MVP for Echo was Lorgok's biceps
[2:56:38] firedragon_1982: @Agk90_ Thanks for the gift sub!
[2:56:50] xFevers: I know Nori and Shak werent going to be able to raid today for liquid
[2:57:05] Lynasz: Lorgok is gold man, funny AF
[2:57:10] Sollice: Until you cant do any more wow raiding because you have no power because you lost your job
[2:57:22] Alaquane: Indefatigable award to THD
[2:57:34] darkscream181: Yeah, I think the in person raiding really burnt them out.
[2:57:35] Korupcija_: isn't main reason they come because of internet?
[2:57:39] Sollice: Dont say dumb things
[2:57:44] Agk90_: @firedragon_1982 np
[2:57:48] xFevers: IDK about that. They were complaining how their internet and FPS was much worst yesterday @Towelliee
[2:57:50] mobbo: Why wouldn’t he?
[2:57:58] mneYEP: max will stream it
[2:58:05] mobbo: Why in the world would Max if anybody not stream?
[2:58:32] RocketMan23: there has never been a race like this though
[2:58:42] emznev: but it worked for echo?
[2:58:45] Heradraiz: do you think the level cap will be raised to lvl70 in 10.0?
[2:58:57] emznev: true
[2:59:05] emznev: yeah thats fair
[2:59:08] MrFuzzynuts420: since castle nathria i've been losing faith in Max :(
[2:59:08] trevt6: they will probably choose a better location. Boston area was ice cold and depressing the whole time they were here
[2:59:09] Alaquane: what's cheaper? hardware stipends for players or venue/hotel renting?
[2:59:12] eyemyor: 8 raiders there?  No, there were more than that
[2:59:12] crescentdh: @Towelliee Hey could you share your playlist ?
[2:59:14] Shrenko: it depends
[2:59:19] Korupcija_: Liquid's roster is half EU KEKW
[2:59:19] MammothGB: I think Sco did say they were considering in-person raiding for next tier, so long as they can get all the support staff etc
[2:59:25] capricore: Quick travel and open borders, no customs
[2:59:41] xChachio: I agree. “Our raiders had to go home!” well that was your decision to have everyone go there in the first place
[2:59:45] QuantumleaperGG: cant go yemen
[2:59:53] xFevers: @Korupcija_  20%, Echo is 10% NA
[3:00:00] capricore: @trevt6 dude, the weather was good for boston in March. i live here
[3:00:04] emznev: method are doing great this time around it is good to see
[3:00:10] eyemyor: Echo has what, 1 main raider NA?
[3:00:22] Djfarmville: @capricore Isnt it easy for americans to travel within america
[3:00:35] KragnosWoW: AngelThump
[3:00:50] Unwashed: I really enjoyed this tier as a viewer, but I understand it must have been grueling for the raiders.
[3:00:53] Zonoxx_tv: @eyemyor 2 I believe, Mini and Jeath
[3:00:53] capricore: @Djfarmville its also a 6 hour flight across the country or a few days drive. People underestimate how large the states are
[3:01:01] KragnosWoW: easy, yes. fun, no
[3:01:09] mmrghost7: i want a revolution for 10.0 something that get ppl addicted again to game
[3:01:10] capricore: FL to BOS is 3 hours, but yea
[3:01:10] Zonoxx_tv: oh and Wolf, so 3
[3:01:20] Shrenko: yeah you dont need passports and other documents travelling between states, do you ?
[3:01:34] rohdey: NYC to Miami is ~24hr drive]
[3:01:34] Djfarmville: @capricore Yeah time wise but customs and borders i can imagine pretty much the same within the EU and within america
[3:01:46] foghagymatyi: also in europe from like greece to hamburg you can get a ticket from  40 EUR
[3:01:51] FrankTizzle: "fun" Kappa
[3:01:55] Armdel: every larger city has its own airport im guessing so if you got the money you can just fly nice and fast
[3:01:56] Sollice: South of the Border lol
[3:01:59] Miketolo71: ahhh the olde route 1 run
[3:02:01] FrankTizzle: being in a car that long is torture imo

[3:02:09] kronic10: great steak house at south of the border !!!
[3:02:09] vail3nce: South of the Border shut down
[3:02:12] eyemyor: East coast N/S drive is so much better than West coast.
[3:02:15] CushyPop: On I-95 yes
[3:02:18] generaljosh721: south of the border is closed now
[3:02:25] mobbo: @cushypop fuck I-95

[3:02:38] thelordyeet: farthest I've driven is northern idaho to socal
[3:02:41] Sollice: Oh thats closed? Maybe they couldnt afford the 1000s of signs they hadleading up to it on both sides of 95
[3:02:50] capricore: I don't even drive to NYC from BOS flights are where its at, 1 hour flight and most of that is waiting in the traffic pattern for a landing spot haha

[3:03:25] misomander: longer than the last two races combined LUL
[3:03:29] RocketMan23: and there are issues with staying home too
[3:03:34] capricore: You're out of your element, living in a hotel and missing the comforts of home. its mentally exhausting
[3:03:42] wEiRdO_dUdE: LUL
[3:03:43] emznev: 20 days is insane
[3:03:48] generaljosh721: @Sollice all these kids too busy playing fortnite on their phones to notice those signs in the car LUL
[3:03:55] ShadoodHD: can confirm, travelled halfway across the world for conferences. just went, stick around, and run back to where i live LuL
[3:03:56] cruzeal: 7 weeks is way too long wtf
[3:03:59] iitsmadness: 10-12 sweetspot imo
[3:04:01] Korupcija_: 10 days
[3:04:01] Djfarmville: It should be months like in vanilla pepeMeltdown
[3:04:03] capricore: 8-15 most
[3:04:11] KragnosWoW: Kappa well if the players were good theyd clear it in 10 days
[3:04:22] captiv8: blizzard doesn't have to do anything, you give them money and you still play what they give you
[3:04:23] Thoreya: i think 10 days is the sweet spot
[3:04:24] ExigentMidnight: Same people who thought that classic raids would take months for raiders to down want 3 month mythic raiding tiers
[3:04:30] Thoreya: a little over after the first reset
[3:04:32] afonseca6: There is no "official" raid to world first, they played 16 hours a day because they decided to.. i dont get it
[3:04:49] ContraRob: If it doesn't get shorter and tuned a bit differently, it will be very hard for other guilds to become competitive. Only a small number of guilds have the money to day raid for more than 2 weeks
[3:04:51] MammothGB: Considering they prep for weeks before, the actual in-raid part shouldn't last more than 2 weeks. That way people are comitting about a month total
[3:04:55] FranciscoTheMage: @Towelliee why does it have to be a certain number of days again?
[3:04:57] jmalmin: Can blame blizzard for making a good bosses sure, but its the guild man management of the guild that failed here. They should have taken a break.
[3:05:00] Korupcija_: he didn't know KEKW
[3:05:25] johnnygmtg1987: does he still play lost ark?\
[3:05:28] captiv8: bless their hearts
[3:05:31] FranciscoTheMage: @afonseca6 i agree
[3:05:43] ExigentMidnight: 6 or 7 boss raids twice as ofter would be better than one 13 boss raid at the pace they release them now
[3:06:03] misomander: i think the liquid roster was a bit younger average
[3:06:03] Moobot: Towelliee is playing on Server US EAST - UNA for Lost Ark!
[3:06:07] ShadoodHD: times changed SMOrc
[3:06:10] Unwashed: @johnnygmtg1987 He did Argos a few days ago so I assume so.
[3:06:15] MammothGB: @ExigentMidnight even a few 3 boss instances would be pretty fun to watch
[3:06:25] brewgamingtv: it seemed like they didn't have the roster that could change like echo sadly
[3:06:28] essentialoils141: long maintenance?
[3:06:39] KragnosWoW: those world first raiders need nutritionists and therapists
[3:06:45] FrankTizzle: No
[3:06:46] akia03: wonder if theyll start recruiting raiders in china now
[3:06:48] Merkuriuz: nope
[3:06:51] Miketolo71: sometimes
[3:06:53] FrankTizzle: Campaign gives you some rep and renown
[3:06:55] CritcobainTV: Nah it doesn't
[3:07:02] Miketolo71: i thought firim campaign stuff did?
[3:07:08] lieutenantdan416: why not?
[3:07:09] akia03: from skyline and such
[3:07:09] Shrenko: towStop towIt
[3:07:09] CritcobainTV: did youget the thing that gives you 50% more cyphers?
[3:07:10] generaljosh721: outsource the world first LUL
[3:07:10] Korupcija_: hahahah
[3:07:16] MammothGB: Pretty sure most guilds had catering on site so their nutrition was covered @KragnosWoW
[3:07:17] FranciscoTheMage: im not sure i understand the notion that blizzard HAS to make a raid the fits into the schedules of these 1 percent guilds... @Towelliee why does it have to be certain # of days again?
[3:07:18] ExigentMidnight: @MammothGB Sartharion was the best short raid in WoW history. I'd watch a mythic version of that raid
[3:07:34] CritcobainTV: Language barrier, different launch times, various regulations lol
[3:07:36] KragnosWoW: @MammothGB they were drinking milkshakes and eating footlong subs KEKW
[3:07:41] dudeimunknown: Whats the addon you are useing to find all the rares?
[3:07:42] mmrghost7: didnt china have that rule that ppl under 18 could only play 1 hour per week ?
[3:07:57] trickyshot_: In china i think you can pay for a reclear for a raid so you can have more chances at loot
[3:07:57] Skydivenaked: Only reason they make it so hard is because of the WA and addons, if they remove that i think we will see a shorter WF race imo
[3:08:13] FranciscoTheMage: obviously not
[3:08:14] MammothGB: @KragnosWoW Didn't say they were perfect KEKW but they did have food provided for them that didn't look that bad
[3:08:21] Toskens: Xy'mox still too hard for HC pugs tho :p
[3:08:35] trevt6: the WA use was 100% over the top
[3:08:36] essentialoils141: server maintenance got extended? @Towelliee
[3:08:36] CritcobainTV: @Skydivenaked towStop towIt Nobody is removing Weakauras and addons
[3:08:46] captiv8: i think they should just simply lock out mythic raiding like 2 days a week so the 1%ers can go out and touch grass
[3:09:06] FrankTizzle: Emerald Nightmare is pretty funny
[3:09:06] CritcobainTV: Whoa, hey. I liked doing EN
[3:09:12] KragnosWoW: just dont download weakauras and addons if u dont like them 4Head
[3:09:30] Tokies: how hard is unnerfed ICC?

[3:09:39] 91Niki: Hello Towelliee and chat towHi
[3:09:40] ShadoodHD: no wa and addons pepeMeltdown
[3:09:41] xFevers: Bosses always get obliterated with nerfs after the RWF
[3:09:41] boopbopbamski: the avg CE guild is 2/11 3/11 atm LUL
[3:09:42] Unwashed: @Critcobain EN was nice, but the tuning was very bad. It was way too easy.
[3:09:43] MammothGB: RWF ends in 3 days then LUL
[3:10:00] CritcobainTV: @Unwashed So was my ex but it was still fun
[3:10:01] Tokies: they think it's too easy
[3:10:06] Tullbiann: easy game
[3:10:08] whuttonburg: age old question @Towelliee/chat - but as a complete new player should I pick up TBC or SL? Looking to  grind/quest/raid (:
[3:10:08] ShadoodHD: fuck it?
[3:10:08] capricore: Raiding should be done on the base UI no Add on. REEEEEEE
[3:10:16] magemaster225: thats only a 1% problem
[3:10:21] captiv8: i bet everyone would get over it
[3:10:21] JediNeo99999: avg CE guild is just starting because they just got 4 piece for most of the raiders
[3:10:23] xXSiebzehnXx: @91niki good morning
[3:10:24] Djfarmville: wow used to be hard BabyRage
[3:10:28] FrankTizzle: #nochanges 😡
[3:10:34] Unwashed: @Critcobain Lol
[3:10:44] boopbopbamski: i am some what new with wow but what i have taken from the game is no matter what blizzard does ppl will ALWAYS CRY no matter what blizz goes left they cry blizz goes right they cry
[3:10:52] daodjinn: is there a way to upgrade all conduits with one item to 252 or is 239 the mac and then 278
[3:10:54] Creative_Pigeon: is it a long maintenance today?
[3:11:17] CritcobainTV: @daodjinn just do +15s and get 265 conduits
[3:11:22] whuttonburg: guys as a new player should I play burning crusade or retail?
[3:11:23] giggz91: I dont even have a two piece yet cringe
[3:11:36] brewgamingtv: this tuning really made a lot of CE guilds go super slow to get 4set
[3:11:38] Frozen_DK: 10.0 surprise release COPIUM
[3:11:42] ActasTV: eu maintenace 1h
[3:11:44] KragnosWoW: now u got my hopes up that the maintenance is for creation catalyst
[3:11:48] daodjinn: @Critcobain so if u only pvp it s a rip right?
[3:12:21] CritcobainTV: @daodjinn guess so? 15s aren't that hard so u can knock it out pretty quick tbh
[3:12:22] Kakotan2143: @Towelliee do you really think Blizzard planned for the players to take this long to beat that Mythic content? Could it be that the teams weren't ready for the fights? You just seem to be putting all the blame on Blizzard and I cant see how that is so. IT was just too hard for them. They had to find the right way to beat it. This time it took longer. Maybe they should play at home for the first leg of the race then meet up somewhere for the last part. 🤷
[3:12:36] rohdey: 4
[3:12:42] Clicklesly: It increases in ranks ^^
[3:12:46] wEiRdO_dUdE: For zone gear, every rank increases it a little
[3:12:47] daodjinn: @Critcobain ok ty <3
[3:12:48] akia03: also depends on rep
[3:12:52] pjahj: pjahj subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 22 months! 
[3:12:56] capricore: @whuttonburgwin Play retail if you've never done wow before. BC was a slog and there are so many quality of life changes
[3:12:57] magemaster225: its cyphers+rep
[3:12:59] The_Metal_Man: maintenance goes till 3 PST today thats a rough go
[3:12:59] Creative_Pigeon: it'll actually tell you on the UI if you look in the top right corner of the upgrade screen
[3:13:12] Kakotan2143: i just think it was hard this time
[3:13:20] Shock0neThree: Shock0neThree subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 9 months, currently on a 7 month streak! 
[3:13:24] vulkankragon: yo you won't play elden ring? its a good game to release frustration
[3:13:29] Frozen_DK: maybe the tuning was so that the average guild takes even longer to clear it because S4 is so long this time around
[3:13:47] FranciscoTheMage: but my question is .. why is that a bad thing that it takes a long time?? it seems people are saying that it shouldn't be this long or am I misunderstanding
[3:13:50] KragnosWoW: just meet up after heroic splits
[3:13:59] ActasTV: when the valor cap gonna be removed?
[3:14:03] snake_like: bliz screwed themselves. they make the raid too easy people trash it, too hard? trash it. middle of the road? no press
[3:14:07] boopbopbamski: do you remember how many times you had to kill the lich king b4 he dropped you the mount?
[3:14:12] CritcobainTV: Thinking that RWF guilds weren't prepared for the fights is insane. There was no testing on the last 3 bosses which is what caused the race to be so long
[3:14:19] darkdestroz: Damn! i missed whats in the box trash or upgrades?
[3:14:31] Colt_Engineer: who you calling peppega kids? kekw
[3:14:35] CritcobainTV: @nightblade19 reset hasnt' happened yet
[3:14:36] xFevers: KEKW the kids who can even do LFR
[3:14:38] KaisenSiru: Hardcore!! PogChamp
[3:14:40] Unwashed: @vulkankragon I'd say it makes you more frustrated :P
[3:14:41] KragnosWoW: is Pepega an emote on this channel
[3:14:43] KragnosWoW: Sadge
[3:14:45] Clicklesly: As a viewer i do prefer it this time over it only lastin 8 days though ^^

[3:14:49] CritcobainTV: Pepega
[3:14:52] ShadoodHD: ah young bucks, what to do what to do
[3:14:53] N3llee: Bottom Line.. Blizz has set the expectation for the last few years, for the last few xpacs that the RWF goes typically a rest or two and no more.
[3:15:11] Korupcija_: nothing should be as hard as vanilla raids and sepulcher was close to it
[3:15:13] darkdestroz: @Critcobain yay then i didn´t miss anything,
[3:15:18] TheCliffyShow: The Early Shift
[3:15:18] The_Metal_Man: EArly shift
[3:15:19] JediNeo99999: the early shift
[3:15:19] MammothGB: The Early Shift
[3:15:20] xFevers: Early Shift
[3:15:24] Qtpants92: eary shift
[3:15:28] Unwashed: The sweeping nerfs of normal and heroic is also a good indicator that the entire raid was overtuned.
[3:15:40] ShadoodHD: anything done by blizzard during that is monkaS
[3:15:44] Panasonic82: Did you finish all your Timewalking dungeons on your druid? :)
[3:15:46] The_Metal_Man: Theyre absolute chads, killed 1/11m then didnt even try for 2/11 for weeks
[3:16:08] akia03: only good thing about this long a race is that all regions are on equil footing
[3:16:26] Kakotan2143: I don't think it should be forever either @Towelliee I just feel like it was too hard for them. I could blame Blizzard for making it too hard but I can't blame them for deliberately making the guilds take this long.
[3:16:30] Tokies: that sucks
[3:16:31] KragnosWoW: KEKW was funny
[3:16:41] ShadoodHD: wonder if they can do their own internal testing without relying on ptr 🤔
[3:16:47] TheCliffyShow: Never understood why the weekly events end hours before reste.
[3:16:48] Tokies: I wonder why they end it 3 hours before
[3:16:48] TheCliffyShow: reset
[3:17:21] captiv8: but they don't have to
[3:17:26] capricore: do they really have a QA team LUL
[3:17:29] Screamnsteam: can they not sim their own raid?
[3:17:41] 91Niki: LUL
[3:17:41] BelacKriv: bug wise, the untested bosses seemed pretty good
[3:17:42] ShadoodHD: depends on what kind of qa team monkaHmm
[3:17:50] KaisenSiru: 4Head
[3:17:51] KragnosWoW: towSip

[3:18:02] TheCliffyShow: Nice super villain laugh.
[3:18:05] The_Metal_Man: I mean scripe and max both said the tuning was pretty much bang on, there were just 6 "end" bosses worth of difficult mechanics
[3:18:06] KragnosWoW: towSip let them burn
[3:18:28] 91Niki: The fact that they scale the bosses DIRECTLY for RWF and then nerf it for the rest of the players after it is done, YES! Ofc they should communicate with the RWF players
[3:18:42] Korupcija_: well they did ,meme how difficulty of SoD was bad
[3:18:57] EmperorFredd: The biggest surprise this race was the 🦀
[3:19:09] FranciscoTheMage: but its like people going on jeopardy and being like they should have told us what the categories are for all the questions..
[3:19:19] captiv8: sounds like a contract needs to be drawn up then
[3:19:30] Kakotan2143: True @Towelliee
[3:19:40] Kakotan2143: i can afgree with that @Towelliee
[3:19:40] N3llee: i dont think blizz can really know how long its going to take them to clear
[3:19:45] FranciscoTheMage: makes no sense from the point of view of creating something thats challengeing
[3:19:53] Heero_Effect: @n3llee agree
[3:20:01] KragnosWoW: "expect 200 pulls per boos"
[3:20:03] KragnosWoW: boss
[3:20:04] captiv8: "u will get it within 2 or 3 weeks, have fun"
[3:20:06] Tokies: They did turn race to world first into a hobo raid towards the end lol
[3:20:08] JediNeo99999: I'm curious is Blizz thought they would do as many splits as they did. That would have made it longer too
[3:20:11] boopbopbamski: i think 2 weeks is good
[3:20:13] KaisenSiru: YEP
[3:20:19] Kakotan2143: yeah thats on
[3:20:21] Kakotan2143: them
[3:20:34] flebbooo: YEP
[3:20:44] giggz91: I feel like its not a blizz problem its a team thing they burned the players out
[3:20:46] stresstest: Splits made me lose interest in watching ,not the length of time to kill jailer
[3:20:47] ShadoodHD: the race turned into a carnival at this point... cant cry over spilled milk 🤷
[3:20:57] KaisenSiru: Especially splits where you use lockouts to only kill tier bosses, and not the others
[3:21:02] Screamnsteam: only 188 EZ
[3:21:03] FranciscoTheMage: @ShadoodHD AGREED
[3:21:05] Heero_Effect: How does blizzard make it so you don’t need splits though?
[3:21:05] Kakotan2143: @shiryux91 mee too
[3:21:14] Shrenko: casuals
[3:21:14] Korupcija_: what the firetruck
[3:21:26] Doog45: yea that's terrible
[3:21:29] boopbopbamski: good change
[3:21:30] rohdey: the friendship patch
[3:21:31] szble: super good
[3:21:31] MR_WYTE: At least nobody slapped anyone else during live stream Kappa
[3:21:33] KonaWolfeee: morning chat!!
[3:21:38] KragnosWoW: cant wait for the toxic fanboys of horde and alliance

[3:22:32] EmperorFredd: @KragnosWoW KEKW
[3:22:41] Doog45: isn't it supposed to only be down for an hour for NA?
[3:22:50] Screamnsteam: whys it 8 hours maintnence?
[3:22:55] Shrenko: gnomes > any horde race
[3:23:02] PvtHudson093: I dont want to miss the vault openings
[3:23:05] Korupcija_: new world Pog
[3:23:05] Moobot: Towelliee is playing on Server US EAST - UNA for Lost Ark!

[3:24:08] xFevers: im 45 in lost ark and cant bring myself to get to softcap because I am so lost on what to do
[3:24:14] KonaWolfeee: @towelliee if you want the true SWTOR fun factor make a new character and play all the story with the new combat rework. as you know the new expansion is a let down
[3:24:35] SivertSchultz: @xfevers Just do main storyline
[3:24:36] wEiRdO_dUdE: Like 6 streamers will have the drops, I heard
[3:24:44] The_Metal_Man: I get my first time off in July since like 2018 I'm super stoked
[3:24:46] ShadoodHD: did you go over the new world patch notes already?
[3:24:50] The_Metal_Man: 2019*
[3:25:14] Scoodles91: no player collision
[3:25:15] FrankTizzle: @Towelliee The Optional Reagent slot for Legendary Crafting can now also be unlocked by completing the campaign quest “The Crown of Wills”. That means you can get speed/avoidnace on legendaries now (HUGE)
[3:25:28] Screamnsteam: guardian 4 piece nerf. its almost un-bear-able
[3:25:31] Scoodles91: i think it was part of it
[3:25:32] Doog45: @Towelliee If you had to pick between lost ark and elden ring, which would you choose
[3:25:39] wEiRdO_dUdE: Player collision was awful, they need to remove it
[3:25:45] FrankTizzle: TOUGH SHIT OMEGALUL
[3:25:46] KragnosWoW: KEKW
[3:25:48] Colt_Engineer: oof
[3:25:55] FrankTizzle: No
[3:25:55] Malitor: So, I just started playing SWTOR a couple days ago (I haven't played since hitting 50 after launch). The Knights of the Fallen Empire is sooo good!
[3:25:55] zigzugg: lol
[3:26:01] flebbooo: OMEGALUL
[3:26:01] snake_like: wait I read that right??! that's fucked
[3:26:02] KragnosWoW: get rekt - blizzard 2022 KEKW

[3:26:10] FrankTizzle: I spent 400k gold already on leggos this patch FeelsBadMan
[3:26:15] FrankTizzle: It's on MMO champion now
[3:26:22] KonaWolfeee: @kragnoswow how's the lost ark grind been for you
[3:26:27] wEiRdO_dUdE: People were literally body blocking each other in dungeons, so awkward and disruptive
[3:26:45] FrankTizzle: It's in today's hotfix notes
[3:26:47] Scoodles91: i bought mine before the double lego week, when they were cheaper :D
[3:26:53] ContraRob: NO player collisuion is going to be great
[3:26:58] FrankTizzle: Under "Items and Rewards"
[3:27:00] 3663Sharad: MMO Champion has a new "Leak" Fallen Legends

[4:59:14] hogan53: I’m taking a toon thru and lots of bots.  Maybe not like a few weeks ago but lots
[4:59:32] KonaWolfeee: @brando_reed44 they also went up because most of us already did that content . not as many people buying them
[4:59:46] TacoNaks: @Naksident yea I don't switch channels alot just when back for 100 complete

[5:06:41] DigitalZonez: im waiting for disk space on my computer lol
[5:06:43] sixRlNGS_: When do wow servers come back on?
[5:06:46] Zaccheas: Im just taking my time, get a few to mid t3. Those honing chances up high are too low for me
[5:06:47] Reckless666: @kingkarellia KR has those so eventually we will get sooner or later

[5:08:57] Reckless666: Mokoko Hunter? Kappa
[5:09:10] shadodefiant: 8/10  would be 9/10 but u spelled title wrong :) lol
[5:09:16] izabeL: @BakiSenpai87 ESO has it's own launcher so you can't use steam to have an accurate count
[5:09:21] ContraRob: @BakiSenpai87 ESO is on console and has their own launcher, steam numbers not great
[5:09:30] Reckless666: ^
[5:09:44] ARealHumanBean: yeah, it's like looking at FF14 steam numbers
[5:09:49] Reckless666: most ppl play on the eso launcher i think
[5:09:50] ARealHumanBean: cant really make a judgement on that
[5:09:54] KragnosWoW: how is the new eso expansion? or did that not come out yet.
[5:10:26] Reckless666: time for a BOOBA

[5:11:51] ARealHumanBean: i enjoyed FF14 but the MSQ tired me out
[5:12:02] KragnosWoW: i didnt experience the friendly community people said ff14 had
[5:12:20] azzurrin: GW2
[5:12:21] shadodefiant: i love lost ark minus the honing system.  SO annoying
[5:12:28] Reckless666: bruh fishing in GW2 is so good 🎣
[5:12:28] hogan53: I’d try FF but the old school tab target and subscription model just pushes me away
[5:12:29] shadodefiant: "honing" is the reason i stopped bdo as well
[5:12:29] CritcobainTV: People were friendly, i just didn't like the agme lol
[5:12:29] brando_reed44: With all the extra mats and auction house prices dropping immensely I've hit a casual 1365 without spending gold. 4 more upgrades and I can do argos FeelsGoodMan

[5:14:50] WonderMog: Warhammer is the only universe outside starwars, I think with so much material to offer like WoW. Its unfortunate the company who tried one back in mid 2000s messed up
[5:15:00] Reckless666: man i pity upgrade every item after 1350... i am big sad :(

[5:57:39] CritcobainTV: @oleoay no it's not, u can get boss rush in tier 1
[5:57:56] CritcobainTV: @oleoay there's 2 diff tickets, there's 2 lvls of boss rush
[5:58:01] Gurtogg: jailer bugged out on methods 0.4% wipe and only healed to 11% wtf lol
[5:58:09] Frenadolx: Im stil at 1340 saving mats
[5:58:15] Frenadolx: for gods knows when KEKW
[5:58:29] CritcobainTV: oh, nvm im an idiot, it's 802 for the tier 1 one, and then 1302 for tier 2 LUL my fault
[5:58:29] Moobot: Towelliee is playing on Server US EAST - UNA for Lost Ark!
[5:58:44] CritcobainTV: tier 2 ticket i mean, tier 3 ilvl obviously
[5:58:47] oleoay: @Critcobain there's a 802 boss rush and a 1302 boss rush.. but im not asking about the min level, i'm asking the recommended level
[5:58:52] Frenadolx: Got like 9k Red stones and 11k blue stones
[5:59:09] CritcobainTV: there's no recommended ilvl, you go in at the minimum ilvl and i you smash it, just like everything else
[5:59:12] KragnosWoW: lol
[5:59:44] Reckless666: abyss dungeon bugged again on EU.. nice
[5:59:45] Lintgamer: apparently the boss was buggend and didnt heal in p4 to 19%
[6:00:02] oleoay: @Critcobain eh well, i believe people also sit on platinum field tickets until they have their life skills high enough so i wasn't sure if it was an easy/automatic clear at 802 or not
[6:00:18] Lintgamer: Yup. Thats what they are saying.
[6:00:23] Lintgamer: Boss was only at 11%
[6:00:35] CritcobainTV: You don't need a high life skill to do platinum fields though? you dont get xp in there or lose durability
[6:00:47] JediNeo99999: It's not a bug. It's mortal strike effects
[6:01:11] oleoay: @Critcobain but the tickets drop very rarely and you don't maximize your gain until you have the higher life skills...
[6:01:15] Armdel: as i understood it, even with the bug they handled the P4 mechanics correctly
[6:01:34] Sielu11628: Ready for Blizzard's April Fool's post this Friday
[6:01:40] JediNeo99999: Echo had it at the start with a warlock pet only doing cheap mortal strike and when they had a warrior doing it the shield was much lower
[6:02:04] Armdel: pretty sure Echo use arms warr on kill and boss still healed to 19%

[6:37:55] ironfist625: EZ
[6:37:57] Ertra: scos like... i've done this a million times, why be excite
[6:37:57] notColt45: Buggged or relieved its over
[6:38:06] the_general01: yes
[6:38:12] shadodefiant: so method got 2nd?
[6:38:17] Nokterian: Arms Warrior ftw
[6:38:17] Armdel: it happened twice so it makes me think its intended
[6:38:17] Gurtogg: he was supposed to heal to 19 but only healed to 11 cuz of bug or nerf
[6:38:20] Rakim88: MS is 5% of his health on sheild
[6:38:23] toobaked1987: Its the mortal strikes. Boss only went to 11% not 20%
[6:38:24] NoWaayMan: method is honestly the biggest story of the whole race lmao
[6:38:27] raptorstrick: Method killed it
[6:38:36] Reckless666: SCO is Gigachad
[6:38:37] JackedDown: Yes lol
[6:38:44] Nokterian: Aye they did
[6:38:46] Rakim88: YEP echo did
[6:38:50] Armdel: Echo had mortal strike but he still healed to 19%
[6:38:52] toobaked1987: Team Liquid you boys need to have a meeting. WAY UNDERPERFORMED
[6:38:58] the_general01: thats a good rebuild for them.
[6:39:05] Armdel: so i think it might be a nerf
[6:39:09] Tupacthuglyf: If it was MS it would have happened on the wf lol
[6:39:11] bigdaddystunna: soooo wheres liquid..?
[6:39:19] raye_gaming22: i hope now pieces theys 3rd
[6:39:33] Zeke_nl: they were world 5 last year i think now world 2nd, great improvement, they had a lot of new players
[6:39:35] Heero_Effect: Well method 2nd place crazy
[6:39:41] raye_gaming22: so that liquid molds
[6:39:44] Djfarmville: wait echo exploited MS in their wf kill?
[6:40:14] Thoreya: jailor thing was weird
[6:40:16] brewgamingtv: Method coming back with a huge world 2nd. Sco did a great job of rebuilding
[6:40:16] Thoreya: but still good shit
[6:40:20] notColt45: Towellie Jynx gone!
[6:40:21] N3llee: @Djfarmville no they didnt exploit..
[6:40:31] MILESkg21: we'll never know Kappa
[6:40:42] Rakim88: @Djfarmville not exploit unknown bonus found in logs thru demo felguard
[6:41:08] y0rtek: he has mixed feelings on the kill
[6:41:09] N3llee: because they boss bugged
[6:41:11] y0rtek: they want to do it again
[6:41:21] Djfarmville: @Rakim88 I call that an exploit
[6:41:23] N3llee: and didnt heal to to 19% only went to 11%
[6:41:25] KingSlayerYotam: hes more glad to be done with it
[6:41:27] fsw94582: i guess the boss was bugged or at least is what they are saying now so i do not think method is very happy
[6:41:29] Sielu11628: At-least realmlist is up
[6:41:36] fsw94582: boss didn't heal or some such
[6:41:46] dimofodi: Hey like I said, 7th in CN, 5th in SOD, 2nd in SoFo. Impressive rebuild.
[6:41:56] N3llee: they dont know what happen apparently they are talking to blizz now about.
[6:42:06] Rakim88: yea method jailer kill didnt heal to 19% only to 11%
[6:42:11] y0rtek: yeah he didnt heal back up and they're upset about it
[6:42:35] fsw94582: i think they would have had it anyway... they were all up and pumping
[6:42:57] Djfarmville: @Rakim88 What other boss mechanic in history has had its healing reduced by mortal strike?
[6:43:17] y0rtek: yes
[6:43:26] y0rtek: sco aint happy about it
[6:43:29] Armdel: healed to 11% i think, but ye
[6:43:29] N3llee: @Towelliee The boss didnt go back to 19% like in Echo's kill. The bosses HP ohnly went to 11%
[6:43:42] Zerohz1: they dont know yet
[6:43:43] Shrenko: they did more dmg
[6:43:44] Rakim88: @Djfarmville ebonroc classic had MS used on him
[6:44:33] bad_fish_too: Damn so the boss bugged out on Method kill
[6:44:54] Djfarmville: @Rakim88 Thats classic dude, everything was designed like sht
[6:44:58] Crowzcut: eu all way
[6:45:13] xyudaii: i dont think the boss is supposed to heal up.
[6:45:20] y0rtek: he is
[6:45:22] TheEvilWeevil: it is
[6:45:22] KingSlayerYotam: this tier was so hard i bet more casuals guild will not even try it for a while
[6:45:47] Alasacy: didnt the tooltip of the nerfed p4 ability say he heals? or was it just absorb
[6:46:12] jerexify: @Towelliee Method raided from their homes, right?
[6:46:31] Lintgamer: All the players are so confused now :D
[6:46:37] mmrghost7: method is coming back bro
[6:46:39] raye_gaming22: i mean they did revoke kills before
[6:46:47] Shrenko: apperantly Method did enough dmg to push that error so his hp went to 11%. they just did more dmg than Echo did
[6:47:00] Vilkanog: @mmrghost7 echo is still way better than method
[6:47:02] raye_gaming22: paragon call tell you a story
[6:47:02] gidgeet: Been playing around with a Deathblade is a lot of fun
[6:47:20] Rakim88: @Djfarmville yea first thing that popped to my mind, but other bosses have had it happen before. its rare yes.
[6:47:22] alucard3zz: the fall of liquid
[6:47:24] alucard3zz: kek
[6:47:29] jerexify: Hopefully that's the way all of them do it from now on, IMO. More comfort and less mental stress.
[6:47:33] N3llee: no
[6:47:36] N3llee: not confirmed
[6:47:42] Shrenko: no, they believe so
[6:47:47] N3llee: someone speculating
[6:47:48] mmrghost7: never tought limit not gonna be atleast world second
[6:48:00] Armdel: i have a hard time believing they out dps'd Echo personally
[6:48:24] jmalmin: I am suprised that Method did get world 2nd. Echo recruited their players. Its really well done from that guild.
[6:48:37] KronasKG: looks like method world 2nd
[6:48:39] the_general01: liquids dps is generally higher than echo's, look h ow thats working out
[6:48:41] JackedDown: @Armdel Just look at the logs? It's true.
[6:48:43] Vilkanog: stop finding excuses method fans KEKW
[6:48:49] 0Rivan0: no they had less dmg they hardly make the phase 3 dmg check
[6:49:04] mavericks312: echos discipline and mechanic handling is why they won
[6:49:05] CanadianCataclysm: Being top 5 in the world is something to be happy about. Pretty good bragging rights
[6:49:14] mmrghost7: sco carried this :P
[6:49:15] 0Rivan0: echo had to dmg stop some times
[6:49:20] Naturalbeef: Cayna
[6:49:40] Lintgamer: Sco is really confused.
[6:49:45] PawgersHC: did mortal strikes stack? is that what happened or what
[6:49:46] flyingmachin3: flyingmachin3 subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 43 months! 
[6:49:53] Collected1: I think Sco wishes they wiped it. damn. that has to suck.
[6:49:53] Moobot: Towelliee is playing on Server US EAST - UNA for Lost Ark!
[6:50:04] mavericks312: honestly I hope we see a 5 guild race come 10.0
[6:50:06] raye_gaming22: method recuted alot of ex players like viklund
[6:50:41] Armdel: Viklund went casual for a while didn't he
[6:50:44] Naturalbeef: Still unclear whether it was a bug or hotficx
[6:50:59] healz4life: Even if a bugged kill they were getting world 2nd anyhow, liquid quit and were just not getting anymore progress done even yesterday, same story, wiping over and over, they might take 5th if lucky at this point
[6:51:27] nightmayor12: method is back baby!

[6:51:52] TheEvilWeevil: liquid gonna dissolve?
[6:51:53] aribellae: @towelliee Why don't they do the RWF on an special realm like they do with arena/m+. Wouldn't that get rid of all of the split runs they all seem to hate?
[6:52:01] zekler: liquid gave up mentally, hard for them to push now
[6:52:07] healz4life: I was thinking that as well. This tier might of ruined liquid raiders to be honest, we'll see
[6:52:09] Heero_Effect: I think liquid will need to rebuild
[6:52:17] wanderlust81: @healz4life but overall liquid still spent longer on jailer than method and echo
[6:52:27] mavericks312: do you see liquid making any drastic comp changes heading into the next tier?
[6:52:40] CritcobainTV: halo infinite is such a shit game lmao
[6:52:49] PawgersHC: How long until Blizz comes out with a blue post you think
[6:52:49] healz4life: @wanderlust81 Of for sure they did, they mentally checked out on that boss awhile ago
[6:52:52] CritcobainTV: Forced to play with Assault rifles, ugh
[6:52:53] the_general01: @mavericks312 liquid is probably going to have to re-recruit several people
[6:53:03] AssassinKhal: this race has been rough for everyone. cant fault anyone for how theyre performing. most people wouldnt last a day doing what theyve been doing for almost a month
[6:53:20] Hypertitan: liquid gets new players every tier, win or lose
[6:53:24] Aethn: If your mains guild contribution is already well over 100% for the week is doing more going to increase what they get or is it better to switch to an alt and get them to 100%  contribution?
[6:53:29] N3llee: listening to sco talk right now they fill robbed
[6:53:35] ambiotic: lightee back to tank
[6:53:44] Heero_Effect: I think max needs to be removed as raid leader. He seemed lost, demoralized, disengaged.
[6:53:45] nightmayor12: They literally got there a week early wtf are you even talking about
[6:54:00] wanderlust81: was bad management by liquid bosses to be fair
[6:54:09] the_general01: @Heero_Effect stop it lol
[6:54:11] jmalmin: Sleeping in your own bed is almost always the best.
[6:54:50] jeffnsteff2019: my opinion  team liquid will grow stronger from this experience
[6:54:50] Moobot: towHAMUP TOWELLIEE GOT A NEW ORIGIN GAMING PC! | https://bit.ly/35GOQIN towSO |Specs https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/414625240233148419/857136797167779860/orringpc.png | Towelliee Gaming is proud to be sponsored by ORIGIN PC!

[6:54:59] B0sh1: hindsight is 20/20. No one knew the tier would take remotely this long.
[6:54:59] Heero_Effect: I think what you said yesterday was have the commentators and maybe like max and a few key people on-site would be good way for production
[6:55:00] MILESkg21: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giXco2jaZ_4 TOP GUN 2 Kreygasm
[6:55:08] Naturalbeef: Liquid had their time when Method fell apart. Now that the EU scene is settled they won't win again
[6:55:18] zekler: what is countdown for, can't see because of lost ark offical thingy @Towelliee
[6:56:21] Collected1: Towelliee on that comms couch
[6:56:23] Quojin: @zekler countdown to WoW 10.0 news
[6:56:36] mavericks312: I will say monsters and hoagie aren't exactly want you want to be eating when your already fighting mental burnout
[6:56:39] Carahail: @zekler Warcraft expac reveal
[6:56:52] zekler: ooh nice
[6:57:07] Hypertitan: Did lula do her thing again for liquid?  I didn't watch the main stream
[6:57:25] Collected1: i think if Sco could reset the boss and go again he would.
[6:57:40] Carahail: @Hypertitan Lula was the best part about it
[6:57:43] aribellae: I think Max is going to come back a LOT stronger
[6:57:52] altlife7: they need to make change
[6:57:58] Heero_Effect: @aribellae I think max is done
[6:58:15] Latherise1978: wow servers are up

[6:58:32] Hypertitan: @Hypertitan I figured...I just wasn't following super closely this time around
[6:58:34] Naturalbeef: I also think they need to look at their culture. Liquid seems like the least mature guild.
[6:58:47] rainvongola: Liquid while raiding environment juat seems too laid-back. I feel they just joke around a whole lot.
[6:58:51] rainvongola: whole*
[6:58:59] BiggTC: NA Servers up
[6:59:08] MILESkg21: Servers Up PogChamp

[7:00:38] Thoreya: u KNOW players are gonna flock to method
