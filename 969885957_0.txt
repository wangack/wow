[0:56:51] Buckwink: please let TBC be in May
[0:56:51] mutersaw: gut feeling for TBC has been prepatch mid may and release in June.
[0:56:52] Collected1: BC six weeks before 9.1?

[1:14:24] dreadvaine: @Towelliee What about the Night Warrior you think she might be in the raid or be the one to maybe kill Silvanus?
[1:15:14] CrossNgen1570: @magemyway and yet people are still so deeply invested in the storyline

[1:17:55] BulldozerBear: Yeah Towelliee is a star when he's offline lol
[1:17:56] TheUnknowing: No way im doing 50 dungeons in like a day the fuck
[1:18:04] kargdahm: imho, the people that want to remove the instance cap is people that play on pvp servers but don't want to pvp
[1:18:07] Dimeric: But why is there even a dungeon cap ? There must be a reason in the first place.
[1:18:10] albertocofi: 50 Dungs without LFG
[1:18:13] MrGattz: id go nuts doing 10 dungeons a day in classic. maybe even less than that. if your doing 50 a day you need help
[1:18:15] Lokajin: Dont underestimate the level of sweat nerds launch day ;P
[1:18:19] albertocofi: that's just nuts
[1:18:22] falldrgn: aren't the dungeon quests outside of the dungeons still? or did 2.4.3 put them inside?
[1:18:31] Malarick: that brings me to my next point.  don't smoke crack.
[1:18:33] Lokajin: @albertocofi the guys worried about the dungeon caps have organized groups for the grind.
[1:18:39] Lokajin: LFG tool wont matter
[1:18:41] Zansteh: moonglade
[1:18:45] BulldozerBear: It's because when @Towelliee thinks WoW is in trouble, everyone perks up, right?
[1:18:52] Jawis: "need more than 50 dungeons" = mages that want to 5 mage the trash in dungeons

[1:32:52] Sincline387: blue post confirms "not an april fools  joke"
[1:32:54] juga27: ive been told outriders is if destiny and diablo had a child
[1:32:55] cowee12356995: I hope for April fools they poke fun at themselves for long dev time
[1:33:03] vuurmannetje: with the TBC one they mentioned the unfortunate timing, aprils fools jokes you dont say that
[1:33:04] ravenoushydra: it's not for tbc
[1:33:05] jeneraljelly: its going to be launched before tbc they said
[1:33:17] katkis88: its for classic era servers
[1:33:18] Gizimoo86: classic will have player base for sure
[1:33:30] 3663Sharad: @Towelliee It will hold your buff, until you click it again. If you activate the "Toy" it will have a CD of 1hour
[1:33:58] katkis88: just pvp flag and kill that rogue
[1:34:00] Gizimoo86: if private servers had players for 10 years pretty sure official have too
[1:34:46] EggwithEdges: Just delete the world buffs lol
[1:34:52] plumpus81: because of griefing and raid logging

[1:34:54] jeneraljelly: Yeah they wanted to make it easy i guess
[1:35:00] jeneraljelly: prevents raid logging
[1:35:02] othraerir: so people don't log out
[1:35:03] Sincline387: get world buffs, use item, play game and not have to raid log
[1:35:04] Near____________: So you dont need to log off to hold buffs
[1:35:05] jeneraljelly: and griefing wb
[1:35:10] iblighters: so people don't feel like they need to stay logged out
[1:35:13] vuurmannetje: sollution is remove WB
[1:35:20] katkis88: @Towelliee you still need to get the buffs normally, then you can turn those buffs into an item that u can activate later
[1:35:29] katkis88: so you dont need to raidlog and stuff
[1:35:33] Masqerader: I thought it was called pvp lol
[1:35:36] 3663Sharad: @Towelliee They want the peebs to play more, instead of holding on to the buffs via logging out. So they say
[1:35:59] headshotb1lly: I think players enjoy WB meta more than they realise > think this is a good solution
[1:36:04] vuurmannetje: Not just the dispelling is bad, the whole idea of putting a character in org and only logging them in and out just for buffs
[1:36:06] jeneraljelly: Its in the game they kinda have to embrace it if they want it to stay alive
[1:36:07] wvivar: Looks so weird with out the led lights etc .
[1:36:11] vuurmannetje: dont need WBS for speedruns tho
[1:36:43] Sals_a: you still need to obtain all the WBs first and then store them all at once
[1:36:51] Lokajin: wut everyone uses wb's for speed runs
[1:36:52] Sals_a: If I read correctly
[1:36:58] vuurmannetje: if noone has worldbuffs the speed will be slower there is still a speed
[1:37:05] Sals_a: So effort to get it all is there
[1:37:10] HolySpiritActiv8: if you're speed running you use literally everything possible so yes wbs are included in that
[1:37:41] T0rchez: lol
[1:37:43] vuurmannetje: yeah but worldbuffs arent a condition for the phenominom called speedruns. They are because theyre in the game
[1:37:43] katkis88: 90% sure thats a bot, farming firewaters

[2:55:11] Akoudadis: is this a rerun from 2015? whats going on whith the lights?
[2:55:18] desmo7: @HickoryLIVE But what will lead to that?

[2:57:36] KiLLaVuLKeN: is the J&J vaccine just 1 shot?
[2:57:39] Ambersulfr: @HickoryLIVE This, and the shot isn't fully effective for a few weeks after the injection so they're still as vulnerable as they were before the shot!
[2:57:43] NovaSun84: Get 20 LULW
[2:58:00] jeneraljelly: I kinda of like the reagent requirement requires some prep ahead of time
[2:58:14] Scojan: I'm thinking about boosting a lvl 58 druid just for flight form since i'm too lazy to farm gold KEKW

[2:59:28] Nerendis: Yeah like Towelliee said, the shots aren't good to go until 2 weeks basically
[2:59:31] Colt_Engineer: @mavericks312 I don't think things will ever truly be "normal" again
[2:59:31] NovaSun84: Thought you said "Got this shit booked the next day"

[3:03:53] DatSheppy: thoughts on world buff vault?
[3:03:56] revilx: raid = no quests able to be completed
[3:03:57] Nerendis: Pretty sure they kept the 10 man thing in, but only nerfed the xp? I could be wrong.
[3:04:00] Ambersulfr: Male Tauren couldn't even go through all the doorways in original vanilla, though I think they fixed it before re-launch.
[3:04:04] Nertok12: you get the key with the "dark iron legacy" quest so go the way over arena @Towelliee
[3:04:15] NovaSun84: yup, and no vendor sale either
[3:04:24] vuurmannetje: are they used in JC?
[3:05:14] CrispyNugs: ya you need both unlocks so you dont have to do the angerforge jump

[3:11:49] NovaSun84: Then you fight Lord Roccor and get trucked LULW
[3:11:52] NovaSun84: Cause fire damage
[3:11:58] Mazemouse: Beartanks tend to be smoother to heal. Less sudden spikes for some reason.
[3:12:11] XensorHUN: Lowers your armor
[3:12:11] Mecabeast: warriors issue is they scale with gear and buffs outside that they're pretty mediocre
[3:12:28] LilChiliMPH: Fixing up the room?
[3:12:52] NovaSun84: enh shammies are licking their lips
[3:12:54] vuurmannetje: also that weapon you got makes you have sick armor already
[3:12:55] Mazemouse: Also, warriors is very dependent on their setup. FuryProt warriors in dungeons are dogshit to heal. Protwarriors are a great to heal.
[3:13:28] vuurmannetje: basically bis raid tanking weapon till AQ for bears
[3:14:15] vluggejaapie89: u gonna stock up on gnomer maces for BC?

[3:26:57] Moobot: Towelliee is NOT moving or homeless. He is renovating his streaming room over the next month or so. The background will change, the stream will be scuffed, but it will be worth it! Soon™
[3:26:58] OPwizard11: @Towelliee These other streamers who just run around soloing dungeons with mages are boring as fuck! Thank god for you Towelliee! TakeNRG
[3:27:02] Colt_Engineer: @Towelliee I heard when it comes to tanking you do the "Bear" minimum KEKW
[3:27:03] Nerendis: Yessir
[3:27:12] jeneraljelly: innervate is % based on the regen of the person you cast it on
[3:27:21] Ranger208: isn't it a percent?
[3:27:25] donpablo_98: towBleedpurple towBleedpurple
[3:27:28] Nerendis: its 400% of their regen
[3:27:59] vuurmannetje: Its like 2x or 3x the time per pack
[3:28:13] eatonaround: they put in an AoE cap in TBC classic?

[3:28:20] vluggejaapie89: its easier, but takes longer
[3:28:37] Mecabeast: I thought wowhead posted something that it just slows things down
[3:28:51] Templexx: if its not that they'll be doing something similar lol
[3:28:55] jeneraljelly: people are gonna be 70 day 2 at that rate tbh
[3:28:55] vluggejaapie89: no batching makes it easier
[3:28:58] Ranger208: No, they're also gonna solo raids Kappa
[3:28:59] jeneraljelly: kara clear day 3?
[3:29:11] Brobertos: day 1
[3:29:12] vuurmannetje: If youre not a mage probably ye :P
[3:29:20] Nerendis: 5 man spamming is how people leveled on orignal tbc launch
[3:29:40] Nerendis: Same as wotlk
[3:29:49] mysteriousm4n: this doesn't look like 9.1 ptr monkaHmm
[3:29:57] vuurmannetje: tho Im suspecting blizz might make it so mobs can melee you from under that ledge in slave pens (as it is melee range) and the mobs no longer path around
[3:30:09] Mecabeast: gotta have mcb for ST threat
[3:30:31] toobaked1987: @Towelliee The beginning prep for the new room. Look how boring the streaming room is now. haha

[3:30:54] keeindordel: wait chat.. why is towilee doing a classic dungeoun as a lvl 56?
[3:31:12] mysteriousm4n: because he's in classic and he's level 56?
[3:31:14] Exodeo_: because it's classic ;p
[3:31:14] Knight_Sid: I used to be Rogue then switched to DH before I stopped playing. Kinda tempted to play warrior but not sure, I worked a lot on my DH mogs etc.
[3:31:14] NovaSun84: need the jailor keys for those doors
[3:31:19] toobaked1987: @keeindordel Prep work for TBC
[3:31:48] OPwizard11: @Towelliee DansGame Players who think just soloing everything is how the game should be played belong in Retail. Classic, and TBC are for social players who ACTUALLY WANT to play with others.
[3:32:05] Morder85_Gaming: ^
[3:32:05] Moobot: Towelliee is NOT moving or homeless. He is renovating his streaming room over the next month or so. The background will change, the stream will be scuffed, but it will be worth it! Soon™
[3:32:22] Ranger208: Some people like to play with others at level 70.
[3:32:26] Nerendis: @OPwizard11 BabyRage but i agree
[3:32:29] Klauzzer: play the game how you want to
[3:32:49] toobaked1987: I talk to people and interact in retail everyday. Thats just like your opinion, man.
[3:32:57] NovaSun84: Is TBC beta now closed btw?
[3:33:02] mysteriousm4n: I made a hunter for tbc and I'm having a good time leveling tbh
[3:33:10] mandarinetip: neverrr
[3:33:16] Nerendis: TBC leveling dungeons have crazy gear and more importantly CRAZY rep
[3:33:21] Morder85_Gaming: i made a pally and i really miss the classic leveling
[3:33:27] Morder85_Gaming: so relax and chill
[3:33:28] Ranger208: and TBC dungeons are fun.
[3:33:45] OPwizard11: @Towelliee Yes but you are spamming with 4 other humans. Not just sitting there exploiting a terrair feature to spam ice storm all day. BORING AF!
[3:33:53] mysteriousm4n: ideal classic leveling is 50% killing mobs 40% running around 10% dungeon
[3:33:55] mysteriousm4n: imo
[3:34:10] Gregadeaux: your lighting is so different without the triangle lights
[3:34:26] vuurmannetje: personally Im an addict to mob grinding while leveling
[3:34:30] Templexx: mEaNinGful joUrNeY thRouGh AzeRoTh
[3:34:33] mysteriousm4n: I lowkey want to wait for tbc prepatch for the changes to make leveling better
[3:34:40] vuurmannetje: tho not as viable in tbc
[3:34:47] Ranger208: Go degen on your first toon and then level through questing on your second when its calmed down a bit.
[3:34:50] NovaSun84: Setting traps after combat starts KEKW
[3:34:51] Morder85_Gaming: made that run from IF to westfall the other day. brought back so old memories lol
[3:34:55] TheSpace_Sloth: inb4 sgc drops

[5:03:10] pemadsen17: @towelliee if blizzard Justified it as a quote botting issue would you have the same stance on Dual spec that you do on paid boost? Knowing the justifications people have given about paid boosts and The Botting Issue.

[5:27:28] WhysRs: @Ranger208 Right?
[5:27:31] Wildside1177: Yeah that quest is only available in ghost I think
[5:27:35] tagteam421: whamp whamp
[5:27:35] MrGattz: @pandag96 i wouldnt expect it to be early. not that im trying to like not get your hopes up or anything but like.. dont get your hopes up is all i can say lol
[5:27:36] Colt_Engineer: are you still in the same dungeon? lol
[5:27:37] d3momhunt3r1988: ^^^
[5:27:40] KiLLaVuLKeN: are there any quests in wow that actually require you to be dead to hand in? like a spirit quest
[5:27:51] WhysRs: Oh
[5:27:52] zodd_amhai: imagine u leveld from that exp what would have hapend? revive?
[5:28:47] TheOldJimbo: towelliee is my hero
[5:29:01] tightbutt88: can I download wow on my portable  harddrive for my laptop and still be able to play
[5:29:10] zodd_amhai: @tightbutt88 yes
[5:29:32] ClockworkZen: @tightbutt88 it may run very slowly depending on the speed of the drive
[5:29:33] tightbutt88: thanks

[5:31:20] tightbutt88: what is the best portable harddrive to get
[5:31:24] Speshulist: There's an auction addon that tells you
[5:31:28] Speshulist: if you link in guild i'll tell you
[5:32:30] icerasta: If you are trying to play games off them buy a portable SSD
[5:33:11] Speshulist: I have a smaller SSD that I keep that and a couple other games on, but not portable
[5:33:43] xAshleyCyanidex: I have 2 drives. A 500gb nvme for windows stuff and my 1TB SSD for games and programs
[5:33:43] Moobot: Towelliee is NOT moving or homeless. He is renovating his streaming room over the next month or so. The background will change, the stream will be scuffed, but it will be worth it! Soon™
[5:33:51] fewyn: i used to have my addons and wtf folders mapped to a usb drive so when i switched computers i'd have the correct addons
[5:33:58] ClockworkZen: your choice is going to be speed vs size. So you'll likely be looking at a high speed 256GB SSD on USB 3.0, which would work great for games, or a 2TB 7200RPM on USB 2.0, which would be slow but usable.
[5:34:14] Speshulist: I love that you have to tell people you aren't homeless LUL
[5:35:01] tightbutt88: my laptop is 8g but i just don't have the space to download wow on my memory
[5:35:08] Speshulist: are there no apps that copy your addons and settings files over?  I feel like it'd be pretty easy to do
[5:35:29] rosina_scarlett: that one is LBRS
[5:35:33] maccaruso: Bijou = LBRS

[5:38:03] Bombayshow: that my life with kids too
[5:38:15] Nerendis: Let's be honest, classic isn't an amazingly designed game by today's standards. It's fun, it's nostalgic, but it's pretty dumb in reality
[5:38:35] magemaster225: do you think we get a preview event before the ptr
[5:38:46] krajar96: hows it going sir
[5:38:56] rosina_scarlett: I just want a pre patch release date so I know when I can solo my BE Hpala

[5:40:55] ForklyftTV: @zyppeli yes
[5:41:13] BRUTALIT0PS: I am guessing it will be 6
[5:41:18] Collected1: yeah needs to be more for BE levelling
[5:41:27] BRUTALIT0PS: somewhere between 4-6 is most likely
[5:41:31] shogon: they gonna PL ya in MC/ZG now?
[5:41:43] Collected1: they wont want to open the portal before BE's have had chance to level up
[5:41:49] TheGaoSora: Was there a prepatch event in og BC or did those start on WotlK?
[5:42:02] BRUTALIT0PS: power level

[5:43:07] sekaboo: ahh..

[5:43:25] TheGaoSora: LUL
[5:43:31] mavericks312: wotlk waiting room has started

[5:44:03] sekaboo: I dont think they should do mop lol

[5:44:08] sekaboo: but bc wolk yes!
[5:44:12] mavericks312: bc was cool but wasnt for me
[5:44:12] Dodeca: they probably will try to create servers for every exp ... lol
[5:44:14] WesSideVandal: i'm waiting for cata classic Kappa
[5:44:31] Mitune: except TB
[5:44:35] Nehcrom: I'm waiting for WoD classic :P
[5:44:44] sekaboo: Yeah cata was good
[5:44:46] BRUTALIT0PS: At the end of the day, it's a business and with 9.1 possibly being 3-6 months away, they need to make money somehow
[5:44:52] TheGaoSora: Player Housing inc Kappa
[5:45:04] jaysteea: I am waiting for shadowlands classic
[5:45:04] Voramir: doesn't that happen in every expac though?
[5:45:12] MrGattz: they can afford it to not come out at all.
[5:45:34] BRUTALIT0PS: True
[5:45:41] MikhePls: Doesn't sound very good for 9.3 though at this rate
[5:45:42] Deadly26: why is 9.1 delayed for so long this is pretty insane
[5:45:53] WesSideVandal: it's almost like there's a pandemic or something mardyz
[5:45:58] Wulfgrym: stockmarket is about future value not current

[5:46:07] DirtyBeef2134: dirtybeef2134 subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 32 months! 
[5:46:12] MrGattz: @WesSideVandal cant blame it all on that
[5:46:17] Wulfgrym: tbc will save the day for sure
[5:46:28] Deadly26: the pandemic affected FFXIV for 2 months. WoW is like 4-6 months behind...
[5:46:34] WesSideVandal: it's a very very large portion of it though mrgattz
[5:46:34] MrGattz: you can only blame the pandemic so many times. at some point its blizzards fault
[5:46:43] sekaboo: it would be legit to see tbc in like may
[5:46:59] MrGattz: @WesSideVandal oh for sure. but i think there is an underling issue here
[5:47:00] Wulfgrym: prepatch may

[5:47:03] Wulfgrym: tbc june
[5:47:05] MrGattz: within blizzard
[5:47:14] BRUTALIT0PS: By now, I would have figured they would have figured a better way to deal with the pandemic issues.
[5:47:15] partyanimalstone: yo what's up @MrGattz
[5:47:16] sekaboo: yeah prolly if prepatch gonna be 5 weeks
[5:47:23] partyanimalstone: sup @Towelliee
[5:47:24] Bombayshow: didnt siege of org lasted for more than 325 days ? LUL
[5:47:33] BRUTALIT0PS: IF that's what is holding them back, but it's likely more than just that
[5:47:39] shogon: i see tbc mid may, 9.1 end of july/ week 1 aug
[5:47:39] sekaboo: I thought about playing classic now but i want to be a Blood Elf
[5:47:43] WesSideVandal: Then again I'm not SUPER SERIOUS raider/content creator/etc, i'm still not even renown capped on my "main"
[5:47:46] sekaboo: ffxiv is a great game but the end game content blows
[5:48:01] Nehcrom: Let's be offensive to FFXIV players.
[5:48:03] Wulfgrym: who plays ffxiv
[5:48:11] sekaboo: New xpac later this year
[5:48:12] WesSideVandal: and yet still have AOTC so maybe i'm just weird like that
[5:48:17] MrGattz: @partyanimalstone hey! cohhHi
[5:48:25] Nehcrom: I think we should be offensive to them! WoW blows FFXIV out of the water :P
[5:48:27] Wildside1177: lol offensive. You mean you disagree.
[5:48:27] Kr0nnes: NOTHING
[5:48:32] mmrghost7: @Nehcrom FFXIV LUL
[5:48:35] ZealotryTV: there was no reason for them to launch SL before 2020 was over
[5:48:42] Nerendis: ^^^^
[5:48:47] LolitaAldea: the pandemic didnt hit the same in japan as in USA
[5:48:53] WesSideVandal: I think FFXIV's next major thing is Endwalker (next xpac)
[5:48:58] partyanimalstone: yo @Towelliee I did my first BWL with quissyCHILL monday night, and it went smooth man.
[5:48:59] Bombayshow: they always release shit too fast
[5:49:02] Deadly26: the letter of the producer is this Friday for FFXIV along with the trailer and full details
[5:49:02] ZarathulPl0x: Its a whole new Xpac so its got the whole works that you would expect from a new xpac
[5:49:14] Sandman_88: ^
[5:49:14] robertjordan83: @Towelliee had to have those q4 numbers
[5:49:19] sekaboo: yeah but take it from someone who has played ffxiv raided in both played both, ffxiv has a better story, crafting and class combos, graphics. wow has better combat, gameplay, end game etc.
[5:49:43] 3663Sharad: Flying!
[5:49:48] Kr0nnes: @WesSideVandal Yeah but they still blame COVID for delay content and cutting content like Ultimate
[5:50:02] Vigi9413: Can 9.1 "save" SL?
[5:50:06] Bombayshow: did they announce a new battle pet instance ?
[5:50:07] Heekss: "New legendarys" - reused shit prolly
[5:50:17] shogon: different is FF14 releases like 9-10 content updates per expansion, WoW has gone down to 3-4 updates and expansion
[5:50:24] Wulfgrym: are people going to play 9.1 is teh question
[5:50:25] Sandman_88: yeah, its okay. SL is just bad and ShB is betters. its fine yall
[5:50:38] MrGattz: @Chancia id say ffxiv also has better music and better raids to a degree. maybe better raid bosses but ffxiv lacks on diverse mechanics

[5:50:42] Vigi9413: I honestly don't think Shadowlands is bad
[5:50:49] Bombayshow: SL would be better without  covenants Everything else is great
[5:50:58] partyanimalstone: I did my first BWL with quissyCHILL monday night, and it went super good. @MrGattz
[5:51:09] SilkeySmooth: don't forget they mite do a benthic style patch with new pvp gear to get
[5:51:24] MrGattz: @partyanimalstone hell yeah man gratz! any good loot?
[5:51:27] Wulfgrym: unless blizzard stops taking a dump on casual players, 9.1 will still not bring the players back for the long run
[5:51:27] TheGaoSora: Yeah that's why ff14 has it better tbh.. no need for major balance patches
[5:51:28] mavericks312: SL is the longest ive played since wrath and cata
[5:51:29] sekaboo: @MrGattz yes and no i would agree somewhat. some of the fights are super fun for sure. I like ffxiv i really do i just wish there was more to do then duty roulettes over over and over again. some of the way they do stuff is pretty cool.
[5:51:39] raptorstrick: Flying mounts
[5:51:45] Alegnowar: what does change in pvp each season other than a rating reset? just same gear higher ilevel
[5:51:50] Vigi9413: I think the start of SL is better than the start of BFA
[5:51:59] sekaboo: oh and i feel like ffxiv has better class balancing
[5:52:05] Sandman_88: we dont need massive changes cause our game functions well
[5:52:06] partyanimalstone: I got the black book and warlock tier 2 belt. @MrGattz
[5:52:26] PimpinMuffins: LUL
[5:52:29] Speshulist: Is that how much money you got from doing regular leveling with AH selling?  Dude that's a lot of gold haha
[5:52:33] Bombayshow: Towelliee I had to switch from kyrian to venthir because my guild died and no one wanted a fury kyrian .. had to drop all my lvl 3 covenants. its sucks
[5:52:35] shogon: i wish wow had the gfx of armor and customizations like FF14, texture quality is no comparison imo
[5:52:41] Poowez: Now it's the eternal grind of anima instead
[5:52:41] Vigi9413: What are the chances we get to actually kill Sylvanas @Towelliee ?
[5:52:42] Heekss: Well covenants is good, the mechanics of swappingg etc is just  bad
[5:52:44] MetallicusGaming: Speshulist he traded gold
[5:52:50] sneaksaway: Ya but stone age of wow Leveling was massive amounts of content
[5:52:53] Sandman_88: @shogon for sure
[5:52:54] Speshulist: @MetallicusGaming makes me feel better
[5:52:55] Speshulist: haha
[5:52:57] 3663Sharad: A lot of people play this way. ignoring all of that covenant stuff
[5:52:59] MrGattz: @Chancia yeah i hear ya for sure. i really enjoy both games and they both do things very very well. i wish wow had ffciv player housing. ffxiv also has beautiful tmog and a casino. wow needed a casino since like wotlk lol
[5:52:59] dream_boxing: Morning Towelliee and chat!
[5:53:06] Sandman_88: @dream_boxing o/
[5:53:14] Kr0nnes: Man, you guys saying is SL is bad ? In FFXIV there is nothing to do there. Gear farming is useless in that game.
[5:53:15] Collected1: they know too many people would quit the game

[5:53:34] MrGattz: @partyanimalstone oh nice! its a lot better than nothing :P
[5:53:36] ZarathulPl0x: I think ff14 has better player retention compared to wow though rn
[5:53:40] TheGaoSora: @Chancia True, they don't need to satisfy competitive players so all classes can be viable and fun

[5:54:35] MrGattz: @ZarathulPl0x idk. theres a lot of hardcore ffxiv fanboys because the entire ff story has been around since like 1992 or whatever. i think wow just reaches more people than ff does

[5:55:46] Brobertos: @Towelliee what happened to that mmo with muskets and cannons?
[5:56:06] Oculusdeath: ever going back to SWTOR @Towelliee ?

[6:22:29] BRUTALIT0PS: How have we regressed?!
[6:22:30] CCG_337: totally agree with you @towelliee lol
[6:22:35] Miketolo71: MMO's are cool when the "wonder" factor dirves people together imo, all the features are just ways to organize it

[6:23:31] jasperboy: What is he talking about? DansGame
[6:23:32] Kittastrophe: TRUE
[6:23:32] theszoti: lazypeon just lost his purpose when he quit wow...
[6:23:33] wreckedgum: then play a local co-op game, stop dissing the mans opinion. his intentions are good for the genre
[6:23:35] neverbornlucky: Towelliee you ready to get AR Glassses and walk around into the world again to catch Pokemon
[6:23:40] BRUTALIT0PS: I barely like myself, let alone someone else!

[6:23:46] Kittastrophe: I'm still friends with all the OG Jesters and CM
[6:23:48] Quecklain: servers would literally burn with 1k players in a zone / layer
[6:23:49] blonk369: That's his point tho - no games are built with content that would be fun for an MMO
[6:23:56] Collected1: yup
[6:23:56] WesSideVandal: @Jamalamadingdong you're welcome/i'm sorry
[6:23:56] Kittastrophe: from pre cata days

[6:28:29] Nehcrom: Sounds like EQ.
[6:28:29] 3663Sharad: So basically a Dark Souls MMO? wtf
[6:28:30] Kize_Gaming: I don't think he'll be happy with any MMO. Honestly, why do people listen to the doom and gloom? Just because he isn't happy doesn't mean you can't be happy playing what you like.

[6:30:04] Malarick: LFM 100 man Rock monster!!! 800 ilevel and higher only
[6:30:08] swervo61: okay but as soon as everyone kills the big rock monster enough times it does become dead content and goodluck getting you "Thousand" players to kill it again
[6:30:10] Poowez: I kind of feel like wow would be more fun if i had stuff like that instead of eternal grind of anima of the forced weekly stuff you have to do. Wow retail have become like a forced daily chore nowadays
[6:30:14] SonofHorus82: that would be fucking awful. If I get suddenly flagged for PVP because some fucking chad attacked something from the other side of the zone then that's an uninstall.
[6:30:14] qwikzz: this dude is such a cuck

[6:31:08] primetimezhilex: @Towelliee  im playing BDO and wow at same time, must say BDO is really funny and it has a lot of different ways to play game, now i like life skilling, professions, workers that do job in villages, alchemy, ecnonomy etc. Doing like that for 2 years already and i really enjoy in that. But in wow i like leveling, pve and professions.
[6:31:10] Collected1: yeah no wildstar mention, rip

[6:39:45] 無職提督: i mean, why not just do it, and have to talk shit the stuff u used to like
[6:39:51] BRUTALIT0PS: Maybe if he played an mmo longer than a few days, he might enjoy it
[6:39:53] Notsoz: He’s not lost it
[6:39:55] Kize_Gaming: If all games are shit... then it's probably the person saying every game is shit... not the games.

[6:39:57] maccaruso: Don't worry he'll show us all the "liberal agenda" in all the games soon enough!
[6:39:57] SylvexDragonskin: @Dittmer its gone downhill for sure. Hopefully the next few big ones turn it around
[6:39:58] Jamalamadingdong: ok then mate, off you pop
[6:39:59] Notsoz: Just upset lol
[6:40:10] Poowez: @Layercake For sure he did Kappa
[6:40:14] LSBreed: @towelliee this guy is off his rocker. All of his references of thing for a great mmo came from WOLTK which was the casualization of WOW. Yet says its not about the features...
[6:40:27] TheGaoSora: oof
[6:40:30] Lazugo: oof
[6:40:30] d3vde: question is also to what extent does he play those games? i mean sometimes you have to get into a game to really love it
[6:40:30] Kreech: That's a hot take
[6:40:35] MrGattz: man lol
[6:40:35] Thirtys3v3n: That speech alone made me never want to even try your content. Lol

[6:40:54] Collected1: at least bellular does negative well
[6:41:00] shocktorrent: most mmo's a re trash what you talking bout
[6:41:03] Wildside1177: What new innovation has come out in the last 10 years? Game changing I mean. He is right.
[6:41:06] kel12123: wtf
[6:41:09] MrGattz: 100%
[6:41:11] PokerFaceMoose: all it is, is he has a narrow idea of what he wants out of an MMO. the genre has evolved in a different way than he wanted.
[6:41:12] blvdxoxo: what would yall play if wow wasnt about, not another mmo i bet

[6:41:12] Xilyane: I dont think he thinks it is dead. But saying MMo cant get better? I mean they def can. Wow has plenty of room for improvement
[6:41:14] Wedgeh: All that video was doing was making me lose the will to live
[6:41:21] dHinTrO: desperation for desperation
[6:41:31] Bombayshow: hes doing like netflix LUL
[6:41:32] maccaruso: Turns out he needs to go to the Bellular school of YouTube content creation.
[6:41:34] Malivise70: Just do the standard crap now EA and Activision bad give me views
[6:41:34] PatrickKaneIsGoat: the MMO genre is a zombie at this point.
[6:41:36] NinjaChane: 100% troof
[6:41:40] Bleusempai: did someone say conditioning? Where's onision
[6:41:40] Funderik: have you ever watched his other videos on mmos? he does some serious in depth stuff.
[6:41:42] 無職提督: yup, like i said, just do it, dont bash the stuff u used to like, bor
[6:41:45] SpectraBG: @Towelliee I'm having a blast in both ffxiv and wow, don't know what's that guy been drinking
[6:41:46] 無職提督: bro*
[6:41:52] FalconBroadcasting: I do actually think it's time for MMORPGs to grow in a huge way, and I think a sort of Wow2 is the only one that could make that revolutionary change again.
[6:41:53] bjg1889: Why not just watch a good LoL player lol not the best plan
[6:41:56] MrGattz: sometimes people are slot
[6:41:58] MrGattz: slow*
[6:41:58] Rastailian: inb4 he complains that he doesn't get mmo-rpg beta invites anymore after that video
[6:42:01] kel12123: he's like the people who said 2000 was the end of the world lol
[6:42:02] Sincline387: "people aren't watching as much and I can't buy my new bugati so Im gonna do other stuff"
[6:42:04] Layercake: People can say the same thing about your video about Shadowlands ...it's bad because you don't like it  Kappa
[6:42:07] Thirtys3v3n: Clip Towelliee's response and posted it to the guy. LOL
[6:42:17] pemadsen17: @towelliee send the MMORPG genre is not dead... Is hyped about playing a reskined MMO that came out in 2008...
[6:42:19] shocktorrent: 99 percent are trash
[6:42:27] Colt_Engineer: no not anymore
[6:42:29] DobChino: Exactly!
[6:42:31] PatrickKaneIsGoat: The genre is dead.
[6:42:40] Xugodx2012: Wow has been called dead since TBC
[6:42:41] Eternal_PM: whos he talking about i just got here
[6:42:49] HaxzorJimDuggan: there are people that like Bless Online
[6:42:51] YardRage: why isn't everyone playing quakeworld anymore NotLikeThis
[6:42:55] N64atNite: 100%
[6:42:55] pemadsen17: came out wrong. The MMO genre is complete crap right now
[6:42:58] Sandman_88: yep, just a big cry baby
[6:42:59] dHinTrO: remember kal online ? lol
[6:43:10] CDubTheRIPper: genre is dead but there are hundreds of mmos and more coming out Kappa
[6:43:15] plumpus81: @Towelliee wanna do some mana tombs and Auchenai Crypts?
[6:43:21] kel12123: but you have to agree on one thing, the mmo scene is not at a good place.
[6:43:22] toobaked1987: @Towelliee did Lazy Peon never expect the market to expand? Or did he assume there would always be a monopoly on the genre
[6:43:27] LSBreed: who recommended this video... can we ban them for a day?
[6:43:29] CDubTheRIPper: but yeah i agree with the quality part
[6:43:30] rocthenite: @Towelliee i am sorry about mentioning it i give you a sub
[6:43:31] Vigi9413: Almost as negative as Bellular vids
[6:43:39] Bombayshow: netflix and politic does that too LUL
[6:43:49] TheGaoSora: Heels LUL
[6:43:49] PatrickKaneIsGoat: @LSBreed imagine getting this mald about an opinion video lmao
[6:43:53] NinjaChane: It isn't a casual type of genre and when you spread it out amongst all the games, it just looks like the genre is dead/dying. There are just way more choices available now.
[6:43:55] psycho_scythe: I see what potential he’s dreaming of, but the reality of it is that the majority of the MMORPG community is just too casual for that dream to be realized. NotLikeThis
[6:43:56] Moronil: Reminder that he bought a story skip in FFXIV, played a few days and said the game/story was bad LUL
[6:44:01] cruzeal: heelvsbabyface is funny lol

[6:44:47] Xilyane: @Bombayshow I almost did. But it oughed through it. Those first 50 hours are pretty rough. but it gets much better after
[6:44:48] 3663Sharad: He prolly bouned himself out
[6:44:55] 3663Sharad: *burned
[6:45:00] Vigi9413: I stopped taking it seriously after the sponsor ad

[6:45:51] zeychs: @Towelliee didnt he do a rage bait video with ffxiv though? Thought I remembered hearing about that
[6:45:56] Kromede: yikes rocthenite glad i stopped watching him KEKW
[6:45:59] Xilyane: Ive kept up with Peon. He has talked about this many times before. But it does feel gloomy
[6:46:15] MrGattz: ik there is a way to check
[6:46:17] illuminationpaladincurse: @Towelliee  how much have you played on your toon leveling ?
[6:46:24] Xugodx2012: Also when it comes to innovation you can only come up with so many ideas before the barrel is empty

[6:47:58] bjg1889: He didn’t get beta last week so the the video was his response lol
[6:47:59] Speshulist: do we really want Everyquest again?  You want people to loot your own body when you die and start from scratch cause you died once?
[6:48:07] maccaruso: Rock guy swinging content all while rolling an UwU character
[6:48:10] Kromede: to Kromede POGGERS
[6:48:17] Bombayshow: Chromie Ass Kreygasm
[6:48:18] SpectraBG: @Towelliee yeah, because why do you need normal bosses when you can have really huge ones which you kill by attacking the sh*t out of their legs
[6:48:21] Xilyane: Im down with better world content. other MMo have done it kinda fun. Im always hoping wow will eveolve its open world stuff. That can be better
[6:48:34] NinjaChane: I liked the part where said if Ashes of Creation fails I'm out. I think with his expectations, well...bye
[6:48:38] Broomba: @Vigi9413 who cant dig out of his youtube channel?
[6:48:46] Vigi9413: He must've really like Sludgefist

[6:49:12] rocthenite: ashes will not live up to his expatations
[6:49:15] CDubTheRIPper: LUL
[6:49:15] pemadsen17: @towelliee to really understand the current state of MMOs and how bad they really are, you need to Simply look at the fact that people were excited and we're excited to play Original Classic and burning Crusade World of Warcraft. Games that came out in 2004 to 2007

[6:49:50] Colt_Engineer: The times have changed to. RPG's 20 years ago were everywhere, FPS's 10 years ago, MOMBA's 6 years ago, Battle Royals in the last 2 years.
[6:49:51] xiamrs: :P
[6:49:51] maccaruso: @RunklePunch Ted Bundy was a verrrrrrry different person
[6:49:59] Malivise70: Lol I don’t think Ted bundy is having any nostalgia bout anything rn
[6:49:59] 無職提督: change of theme is of course a hard process, but dude, it wont look good when u bash u r old content, just say he had to move on, and let ur viewer make their choice
[6:50:04] Bombayshow: yep
[6:50:05] Vigi9413: nostalgia sells
[6:50:07] Broomba: rift, tera, aion, etc all had hype and then died
[6:50:13] kel12123: who's excited about p2w boost bc?
[6:50:15] net_mi: Man, all those AoC shills. The game will be biggest flop in game history. They've been showing same area for previews, which anybody with some skills can build, it's really easy with UE4
[6:50:17] Broomba: emotional profit
[6:50:19] NetherRegion: lol yuuup
[6:50:20] g_bubs: nostalgia is a short high yea
[6:50:21] RunklePunch: @Maccaruso yeah...i know lol
[6:50:22] Speshulist: if i had to pay for classic, I wouldn't have.  It comes iwth my normal one, so i'm good with that
[6:50:24] pemadsen17: @towelliee people have those feelings because the current games aren't achieving that level of satisfaction.
[6:50:25] Bombayshow: Towelliee Just like when I played doom 64 .... LUL
[6:50:30] Poowez: i mean everyone's got a different. taste. I hate retail wow from all the daily/weekly stuff they're forcing down your throat but love classic from the way you have to bond together as a community outside of a guild as well. I feel like every MMO has their unique thing that captivates people. In retail wow you just bring out your wallet to complete stuff if you're lazy enough sadge
[6:50:32] theDirtyon3: or people playing it for the first time
[6:50:34] Skizzurp: and they get do make money with little investment because they have that content done already
[6:50:36] DobChino: tbc will be better since there is a lot more to do in it then classic

[6:50:43] rocthenite: asmongold droped out of phase 2 due to how toxic the pvp was
[6:50:58] Vigi9413: tbc might make it a year before the huge drop
[6:50:59] Broomba: oldest profession is recycled content and prostitution
[6:51:02] theDirtyon3: theDirtyon3 subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 11 months, currently on a 2 month streak! towHAMUP
[6:51:06] bjg1889: Look at all the steaming services all the new shit coming out is based on nostalgia lol
[6:51:09] YardRage: i got five kids to feed!
[6:51:14] Poowez: @DobChino And you don't have to farm world buffs all the time
[6:51:17] kel12123: well the pvp is toxic for the streamers. it's pretty average for normal players
[6:51:17] NinjaChane: i played classic for about a week and quit for that exact reason. My friends who i played with didn't come back and realized it wasnt 2005 anymore and quit.
[6:51:20] delmoranis: damn you are spitting facts lol
[6:51:32] teatimer889: @Towelliee  nice streaming room ?
[6:51:35] 無職提督: 100% correct
[6:51:43] MrGattz: somehow
[6:51:45] MrGattz: idk how
[6:51:49] teatimer889: @Towelliee new*
[6:51:50] g_bubs: why do wow players care about population. they only want high dps and experienced players so why do they constantly cry about not attracting new players for them to insult...
[6:51:51] Vigi9413: Lineage 2 is alive?
[6:51:51] xiamrs: lineage 2 was/is good
[6:51:55] rocthenite: when i found out classic is mostly people doing GDKP with gold people brought from gold sellers that when i bowed up
[6:51:56] xiamrs: not the mobile version tho
[6:52:02] 無職提督: linage is like wow for us asians
[6:52:18] Vigi9413: are we saying the mobile game is alive?
[6:52:31] TheGaoSora: because eastern LOVE that P2W microtransactions
[6:52:32] kel12123: well with eastern and communism they really have no choice lol.. and they breed like rodents..
[6:52:34] Deadly26: Isn't Dungeon Fighter Online still the top grossing mmo?
[6:52:38] 3663Sharad: DIfferent times

[6:52:55] cashflowman: bingo
[6:53:07] 無職提督: not really about how the graphic and gameplay of linage

[6:53:18] SilkeySmooth: eastern players accept the p2w and western players don't the future of mmos is eastern style mmos

[6:54:26] Kromede: waves
