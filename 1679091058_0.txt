[0:43:54] R3TRI3UTION: Well...Seems cod implemented communism in a game. The patent calls out specifically lowering a skilled players damage compared to everyone else in the match and making it such that your shots don't connect. Just dropped by to say, vote with your wallet, kill MW2. Much love Mike.

[0:50:06] ShaddyDaShadow: @CplGoon most wishlisted on steam
[0:50:06] Demiplane: Yup
[0:50:06] R3TRI3UTION: They probably wouldn't implement some psyop like cod so no nwo dev company wanted it.
[0:50:07] LiveFromStua: Something is fishy here monkaS

[0:50:30] Kiuum: You should check dead matter dev blog after this @shroud
[0:50:30] blakksheepz: Seems like a risky investment with the company’s track record
[0:50:30] xSpooby: what game is this?
[0:50:30] StreamElements: @xSpooby, he's playing Just Chatting
[0:50:32] xxdead_fallxx: Still think dayz is the best survival game ever
[0:50:39] Joovaaa9: I knew since Day One it was a scam
[0:50:42] SevenClad: apple store PepeLaugh
[0:50:45] adxdope: can't wait for Diablo 4 but never heard of this

[0:50:52] Itz_HawkZ: Yo chat what game is this
[0:50:52] StreamElements: @Itz_HawkZ, he's playing Just Chatting
[0:50:55] LuxxBTW_: Dead Matter LUL
[0:50:57] MrK4izer: soo this is maybe a new "no man's sky" situation?
[0:50:59] xVinnyTheKidx: Looks like the division
[0:50:59] Phenomenal_l: imagine showing a VC they have the most wishlisted game on steam and they still pass KEKW
[0:50:59] ToeKneeZamboni: Madge ad
[0:51:01] Xaker167: Infestation yeah!
[0:51:03] ShaddyDaShadow: @Joovaaa9 Not the day before?
[0:51:04] aymen16ttv: yeah the game good bat am not gona pay sheet
[0:51:09] sird0pey: @Kiuum super bad

[0:51:12] shme18: Talking about Pubg 2?
[0:51:17] Joovaaa9: @Joovaaa9 LUL LUL
[0:51:20] Atx_Merce: but everyone has seen good ideas and even demos that were staraight trash
[0:51:20] Maavroos: WHAT GAME IS THAT
[0:51:23] Nysor1: whats the name of this game?
[0:51:24] Kiuum: @Kiuum They apparently  changed the whole dev team
[0:51:24] ShaddyDaShadow: @Joovaaa9 KEKW
[0:51:27] kevy_g_: @MrK4izer i mean no mans sky stuck with it
[0:51:27] iHeartist: monster energy commericial audio is unreasonably high. wtf
[0:51:29] HonestRazorback: Having a good dev team changes everything. Rust is the perfect example. It still has more active players than any other survival game and it's because they have devs that give a shit
[0:51:29] valaoekosoves: Pla y
[0:51:29] xotyyler: !apexsens
[0:51:30] StreamElements: @imtylerna, Apex: 3.0/1.0 ADS Sens | DPI: 400 - Windows: 6/11 - Raw-Input: On - 1000 Hz Polling Rate
[0:51:34] UncleRespect: maybe thats a ukrainian devs makin it, and now they got now power
[0:51:36] flushinit: @phenomenal_l theres a problem there
[0:51:36] gnfnrf: The weird thing is that it takes money and skill to make a fake this good.
[0:51:39] Atx_Merce: looked good sounded good but was a dumpster fire
[0:51:39] alexrvrv: @maavroos Just Chatting
[0:51:40] Soulstalker851: @shroud What do you think of docs game?
[0:51:42] 1andonlynanoo: screen tearing is real bad
[0:51:45] Surrenic: @Grote_Meloen @Grote_Meloen Guerrilla?
[0:51:46] fatbatmanni: inventory looks kinda bad for this gameplay
[0:51:47] CobraBS: WORK AT FNTASTIC OPEN POSITIONS  Sorry, there are no positions available at the moment.
[0:51:55] Maavroos: @alexrvrv THE games in youtube video
[0:51:59] FROSTYSLAYR: My guess is this game will get delayed massively. Since March is literally 3 months away. Otherwise it will flop if it’s not done.
[0:51:59] shme18: Looks pretty good
[0:52:00] valaoekosoves: Play pubg or squad ?
[0:52:03] DareTheDragon: its about capital too. they need to get money in to make a big and great masterpiece i guess
[0:52:04] su1k1: damn zobies i hate all content about them
[0:52:09] xSpooby: is this the division 3?
[0:52:11] alt_account3747: game ??
[0:52:11] fps_cosmos: last of us part 3 in works guys HahaBall
[0:52:11] Lights_Army: cyberpunk got a lot of investors very cautious now I bet
[0:52:12] R3TRI3UTION: No one wants to invest in anything that isnt going to help intel agencies. Thats my take of the future of gaming. Cod is my case and point for this statement. If you're not a pile of shit, your game wont sell.
[0:52:16] lechonki: I mean prop night is good, unique and a fun "party" game
[0:52:21] SevenClad: remember Crucible :tf:
[0:52:24] The_SaucE_Show: I was looking forward to this coming out and well this is were we are at. I went to scum
[0:52:25] shme18: Bro thinks he's tough talking on Twitch 😭if you ever see me in the streets you better run because I don't play no games. Im from the hood g, I grew up in the slums and my street cred is not to be questioned gang. U Don't play wit me or shi will get ugly fr fr. . 💨🚬
[0:52:28] ihabnolegs: the game is available on youtube for reviews
[0:52:30] jayonyx_: notice how its a survival MMO but they never show anything but that mall and the city. the only outdoor scene shown in the cabin.. i think its limited.
[0:52:35] Grimij: @HonestRazorback rust is 9 years old and still early release tho
[0:52:37] soldieRplaysss: game name??
[0:52:37] finalclouds: Will there be elden skip today?
[0:52:37] DannyTrill: God that screen tear wtf?
[0:52:39] perm_hf_ftw: Sounds super sketchy
[0:52:41] Kuzye_: This guy repeats himslef a lot
[0:52:41] Jinzok: Nobody wants to make a True Survival like DayZ because it is hard to monetize

[0:53:18] JxkeyGG: have you seen high on life shroud?
[0:53:20] HonestRazorback: @Grimij and also has more active players than any survival game. It has triple the amount of players that DayZ has and it's because Rust has a great dev team
[0:53:20] primo_shelby: whats the issue here, did this game scammed people by not launching the full game?
[0:53:20] DarkSoulsRocks: "Hogwarts Legacy Game, #1 in top wishlisted"

[0:58:53] DareTheDragon: and shroud
[0:58:54] hikka27: HOPIUM
[0:58:54] monsnow: Yeah. The gameplay itself or the vision of the game will stay the same. Because pretty much theres nothing to expand on that area when it comes to GTA.
[0:58:55] Grote_Meloen: @shroud I remember them saying adding Gas to cars would be to much realism for GTA 5
[0:58:56] Fictitious1267: with bathrooms. hugely underutilized in gaming Kapp

[0:59:08] pedocas11: play valorantº
[0:59:09] raaake: its EA!!!
[0:59:09] R3TRI3UTION: step 1. Hack pay to win game companies. Step 2. delete source code=win for the people. Step 3. Gather good devs, create new company. Step 4. Create game that doesn't prey on people and returns fun and relationship building to gaming through creating the best games ever.   Thats me living in a perfect world. To bad we live in fuck fuck land.

[1:21:46] casolaire: um don't you know chat has a PHD in Buttonology shroud? They know what they're talking abouot
[1:21:46] zujajsp: i think it is also cause of the qte system, elden ring queues up your buttons
[1:21:47] Yousef2843: the thing is there's no space for any more actions @shroud

[1:22:20] eggwhitesarenotblack: true
[1:22:23] Sparda84: Wtf thats weird
[1:22:24] ItsGary: Have you been enjoying the Simracing?  Are you going to keep at it? :)
[1:22:25] cartierdork: but the diffrence is your not pressing a button on controller with your pinkie where as when you use your thumb you have more control rather than using your pinkie
[1:22:25] max_headroom___: 5head

[1:51:24] slowtank89: That will take a number of people
[1:51:28] strider_8: is he done with elden ring?
[1:51:35] GaaRaNS: GaaRaNS subscribed at Tier 1. 
[1:51:36] quatrokanto: @shroud also, AR generally works with trackers, and since the cameras they have is static i think it would make this way easier.
[1:51:47] Jagarz: @keyzersouza no
[1:51:47] Oakamoore: This guy made and animated it himself within Unreal Engine
[1:51:48] Myuri_: that just looks like the model from one of the older games tbh. They probably just ripped it
[1:51:49] blissfulparanoia: that would kinda make AR for the Pokemon TCG easy to make, no? they're already 3d models
[1:51:51] shakingfromstarvation: ResidentSleeper ResidentSleeper ResidentSleeper ResidentSleeper

[1:52:19] slowtank89: there is no way that every card is already done
[1:52:20] Fhurries: If you settled for static models, this would be a much easier process. Like you said, really depends on your ambition for this project and the game involved.
