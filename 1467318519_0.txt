[3:03:00] Jimstur: I wanna ride my dragon in icecrown zone
[3:03:04] feherlofia123: Wrath sounds dope, i never played it. but i cant bare myself to level in classic again
[3:03:09] ArcaneSyntax: I'm not even sure I'll play wow if it doesn't have dungeon finder.
[3:03:11] cahoots82: Let's go Classic MOP!
[3:03:12] Morpserie: wrath is meh
[3:03:13] Alepouditsa: i think warth will be a filter for the new expesion
[3:03:19] KaptnG: Servers up, or haven’t gone down yet?
[3:03:32] courtesyr: Did WoW die? I'm in Proudmoore Stormwind AH, and there isn't the amount of people there used to be? @Towelliee
[3:03:44] kimmo_gaming: @Towelliee No no no, top 3 is TBC, Legion and MOP, then Wrath maybe
[3:03:45] SilkeySmooth: i thought legion was meh
[3:03:46] Morpserie: i didn't even know he existed back in the day when it launched, i'm like who tf is the lich king
[3:03:48] Red_Dead_Redeem: I started in WOTLK so for me it has a special place in my heart
[3:03:49] Chuckforfun: @courtesyr Alliance is dead ;D
[3:03:53] Doog45: wotlk is when I started playing, so it has a special place for me
[3:03:54] sLogOG: yeah wotlk was literally warcraft in terms of story
[3:03:57] warrenny: What are your top 3 @towelliee
[3:03:57] Naowh: have to say that wrath had some of the best zones ever tho, and new expansion looks similar which makes me very excited
[3:04:00] Syghtless: for me it would just be nostalgic cause thats whe n istarted playing @Towelliee
[3:04:04] TheCliffyShow: Yet, he has a tattoo of a character from Wrath.
[3:04:08] Arms_Warrior: wrath was like 7/10
[3:04:09] Joryckfree: I think wrath could be awesome if they will bring there LFD , without that its just another simulator of yelling in the trade chat looking for tank
[3:04:12] duman_2020: BE music is one of the best!
[3:04:17] Sollice: @TheCliffyShow He likes the character not the expansion :P
[3:04:26] king_julian_96: what about cata did you liek cata in it's original run and do you think we will get a cata classic at soem stage toweliee
[3:04:29] TheCliffyShow: Northrend was big to.
[3:04:40] TheCliffyShow: @Sollice I am. Just trolling a little.
[3:04:44] Alepouditsa: realy? i can't wait i was thinking of wanting a new expesion to realy big
[3:04:46] MBG_95: I started end of BC, so Wrath was my first new expansion. I know its mostly nostalgia, but I enjoyed the raids
[3:04:49] LordKain73: BC was meh.  Wrath was the best.
[3:04:50] feherlofia123: 4 zones + dracthyr starter zone. how can it be bigger
[3:04:50] Morpserie: northrend is huge
[3:04:51] Coriollis: the zones are great also activating and doing hard modes in ulduar makes it quite the unique expansion
[3:04:52] Red_Dead_Redeem: can't wait to train my dragon and customize it Pog

[3:05:12] ArcaneSyntax: boring tundra KEKW
[3:05:23] sLogOG: I hope it won't be "empty big" because of flying from 1st day @Towelliee
[3:05:26] TheCliffyShow: Wrath's tagline should have been, "Hope you like snow".
[3:05:29] AwelessOne: I hope they make the zones play around having everyone being able to fly right away
[3:05:30] Syghtless: they've said its not like SL
[3:05:34] FrogJesus1: They said in an interview Dragon Isles are bigger than Northrend
[3:05:44] Alepouditsa: with one is biger from all expesions? the contens
[3:05:49] flebbooo: I really hope they don't disconnect the zones like they did for SL, feels way nicer to move from each zone
[3:05:58] jpwastaken_: what was wrong with wrath that u think it's not even A tier?
[3:06:05] Shrenko: its like the skyscale and griffon in gw2
[3:06:05] king_julian_96: cata was'nt so  bad had 45levelign zones but all seperate parts of azeorth
[3:06:06] evangarstorm: more like gliding
[3:06:08] Mazerbeam: It will be a step up from goblin gliders to start
[3:06:08] warrenny: Kinda hope theyre connected shadowlands was good but seperate zones were dumb af
[3:06:14] king_julian_96: azeroth
[3:06:16] Milanesa_De_Pollo: Will Drakthyr have other humanoid forms?
[3:06:18] azukh1: it will feel like a glorified flight masters whistle to start with
[3:06:19] Clicklesly: It basically just means you don't need to stock up on Goblin Gliders for the expansion Kappa
[3:06:27] YardRage: faster-than-light travel or riot
[3:06:27] TheCliffyShow: It made sense for the lore of Shadowlands. Even if it was troublesome at times.
[3:06:37] Mistery836: I don't mind not having flying at the start. never did. it just took so long before you could get it after you've done all the content of the release LUL
[3:06:38] apollobaker: @Towelliee which vape are you using?
[3:06:43] jpwastaken_: feel like they took gear appearance and raiding/pvp to a whole new level back in wrath and all other expansions still live of what they created back then
[3:06:46] Milanesa_De_Pollo: So they are stuck with male blood elf and human female?
[3:06:57] king_julian_96: did you enjoy cata though toweliee when it was current
[3:06:58] KaisenSiru: @TheCliffyShow Finally someone with common sense!
[3:07:01] MBG_95: no flight whistle was kinda sad in SL
[3:07:06] ThatGuyFayde: @Towelliee what ilvl do you need for heroics?
[3:07:07] king_julian_96: cause i would liek to see a cata classic
[3:07:16] Praetour: Can you get the 40 renown item from Oribos on a non-alt @Towelliee ?
[3:07:22] RPClipsGTA: shadowlands classic
[3:07:34] apollobaker: Fan_of_Dan subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 3 months! which vape are you using?
[3:07:34] feherlofia123: wasnt paladin (all specs) bis for all content in wrath both pve and pvp
[3:07:50] Morpserie: you're not supposed to be a gnome evoker tho D:
[3:08:00] よろしく: it's always the gnomes
[3:08:02] Morpserie: silly people
[3:08:03] hbsause: ret wanst that great but holy and tank where pretty good
[3:08:11] SilkeySmooth: wrath will be a dead expansion with lfd
[3:08:13] Metket: @feherlofia123 no dk is the best for all
[3:08:14] KaisenSiru: @Milanesa_De_Pollo They're more like half human / half elf breed. The human females have pointy ears if you look closely
[3:08:17] Milanesa_De_Pollo: It's more or less to choose your humanoid form, would be nice to choose different races for that, and keep the dragon form when fighting
[3:08:19] Reemius: dracthyr just seem like a perfect race for a tank to be honest
[3:08:29] LordKain73: @feherlofia123 bi, DK was 💪
[3:08:31] feherlofia123: @hbsause i heard ret was batshit op in arena
[3:08:34] hbsause: @SilkeySmooth they arnt putting it in as per the interview
[3:08:35] SilkeySmooth: witout
[3:08:43] AveragePvp: @reemius ehh
[3:08:45] Joryckfree: I really dont like ppl bitching about the look of Drak Thyr  cuz they want him more bulky , like bruh every race in wow is arnold schwarzeneger already please no more
[3:08:46] itsapaul: Wrath didnt have LFD for 3/4 of the damn expansion chat, chill
[3:08:49] hbsause: @feherlofia123 i was talking pve rather than pvp
[3:08:56] Aquadriel: even classic andies want LFD KEKW
[3:08:57] mizerboy: @Towelliee  - I know you have been looking forward to today for awhile. OW2 beta baby. You know you are a closet OW fanboy
[3:08:58] Praetour: Warmane and Molten had been going for years with as is Wrath, LFD would be fine
[3:08:59] SilkeySmooth: i meant with out lfd
[3:09:00] TheCliffyShow: Not complaining about the "only Dracthyr can be Evokers thing". Am a little annoyed Dracthyr can't be other classes. But, there's a lore reason for it, and they said it might come in the future.

[3:10:22] mizerboy: Agree
[3:10:23] Milanesa_De_Pollo: I wish for first season they would go with the new 8 dungeons
[3:10:28] Red_Dead_Redeem: pple just don't have the time to spam General chat to find a group, also times have changed...not all groups accept those that are not geared or up to their expectations...so LFD or LFG was good in that aspect IMO
[3:10:30] swordart2022: Same
[3:10:36] mizerboy: same
[3:10:38] TheCliffyShow: Season one should be all the new dungeons. Start mixing it up with season 2.

[3:10:52] Truthseeker96: we need to learn all them by heart first
[3:10:52] Korupcija_: I disagree, even new dungeons get old fast
[3:10:58] warrenny: Yes
[3:10:58] thenormalbeast: I think they dont have all 8 ready in time

[3:11:10] TheCliffyShow: It makes more sense.
[3:11:15] warrenny: Or donthe new ones plus old ones
[3:11:16] Jimstur: I just want MORE new dungeons....
[3:11:16] Lundrai: switch dungeons every week imo

[3:11:19] feherlofia123: @thenormalbeast they hqve 12 months lol
[3:11:24] raye_gaming22: i would rater have no trinekts in M+ then farmingthem like we do now or gutt them so hard that they are no useable in raids
[3:11:25] HecticSpaniard: fancy
[3:11:28] Dimeric: Yeah. I play the new expansion to do the new dungeons, not the old ones.
[3:11:28] HecticSpaniard: Kappa
[3:11:29] swordart2022: Makes no fucking sense why just 8 and why not 12 or more
[3:11:31] king_julian_96: or just do all 8 dragonflight dungeons  with old dungeosn that way you get more then 8 and have multiple choices that's the best way to go i reckon
[3:11:39] EmperorFredd: What Discord? Kappa
[3:11:39] vulkankragon: @Red_Dead_Redeem there will be lfd addons in wrath similar to lfd addons in tbc, don't worry

[3:13:30] michaelkn: Shadowpan Monestary is legit one of the worst dungeons :P The whole dojo ring fight is just so boring and time consuming for no reason
[3:13:31] Praetour: Surely some wrath dungeons in M+ to tie with classic
[3:13:38] azukh1: seems like a waste of resources to make just for prepatch
[3:13:41] Aquadriel: hope they keep uldaman after prepatch, cause having it for short time sucks tbh
[3:13:42] its_andyd: Only 2-3 weeks? What a waste of development time

[3:14:01] Sollice: @neatgangdotcom Its not 2-3 weeks dont feed the troll
[3:14:01] Praetour: Yeah I guess thats when they introduced the basic timed dungeons
[3:14:02] Syghtless: anythign before mop is odd, Cata might work cause its good and kidna modern dungeons
[3:14:08] warrenny: @aquadriel They did the same with ubrs so maybe
[3:14:14] conv3rge_: tol'vir mythic+

[3:14:31] michaelkn: @Towelliee didnt he specifically mention stuff like halls of lightning? maybe i remember wrong
[3:14:31] Syghtless: mod and wod has challenge mode, way easier to fit than the older stuff @Towelliee
[3:14:33] Dimeric: WoD actually had some very good dungeons. I would welcome some of those.
[3:14:34] Coriollis: idk dragonsoul m+ with tyrande don't think is possible cuz of continous adds
[3:14:34] Arms_Warrior: i hope they bring in the train dungeon in wod
[3:14:40] Aquadriel: warrenny it just sounds so inefficient to remake a dungeon just for 6 weeks lol
[3:14:41] TacDuc: If they go with Cata dungeons they will have to tune them a lot more, atleast some of them

[3:16:28] king_julian_96: what i would of done for season one of dragonflight is had all 8 dungeons available and add a few old dungeons just to keep it fresh  and that way can keep the feelign fresh without excluding all the new dungeons in dragonflight  and with every new season  switch the old dungeons around so you constantly have a new feel without not being able to do all dragonflight dungeosn on the mythic plus table that';s what i would do

[3:16:40] Truthseeker96: the only stuff we farmed from that week were trinkets. Depending on the system they have in the new expansion can affect your vault options imo. if we arent getting legendary weapons or anything like that then i want more chances at getting my max ilvl weapon from vault ya know

[3:17:31] Orcidbf3: 8 then 2 in each big patch would be good
[3:17:31] BlueBlurPrime: I liked the deadmines rework
[3:17:39] AwelessOne: I mean if the dungeons are updated to be more inline with current content in terms of mechanics I think it'd be fine
[3:17:46] ItsXolten: We need Shrine of the Storm and Kings Rest Kappa

[3:17:56] vulkankragon: i think they are trying to go the ff14 route
[3:18:03] ZAVHALLA: I think probably they'll start w 4 new dgs and 4 old ones and then add at least one per new patch after that!
[3:18:07] Syghtless: nah that is reasonable
[3:18:09] Coriollis: old dungeons m+ is fine for the first 2 sesons, keeps Blizzard from having to divert too mnay resources while giving players stuff to do

[3:18:16] PositivityCoach: good morning @Towelliee have a good day and gl with your games today :] peace and love
[3:18:30] swordart2022: 8 is joke
[3:18:30] Tommo5000: I like the old dungeons coming in m+ because its evident of a design shift not to abandon content on release of every expansion. We should have new dungeons too like.
[3:18:32] Korupcija_: I disagree, those new dungeons nobody did even after 50 nerfs
[3:18:37] Syghtless: yeah but dungeons are like double the effort now from the dev team @Towelliee
[3:18:42] swordart2022: At least how many Legion had
[3:18:42] jpwastaken_: remove tyrannical as an affix
[3:18:45] ZAVHALLA: I think probably they'll start w 4 new dgs and 4 old ones and then add at least one per new patch after that!
[3:18:46] raspyoftow: morning
[3:18:47] TacDuc: BfA had 2 less than legion, and SL had 2 less than BfA
[3:18:54] Aquadriel: @Towelliee i love the concept of mega dungeon, but people literally runs them the first week and never again until next patch 6-8 months ahead.
[3:18:57] Lataran: do we know when aplha starts? @Towelliee
[3:19:07] Shrenko: no @lataran

[3:19:28] Lundrai: cata dungeons at launch were a good time
[3:19:28] TheCliffyShow: BFA had great dungeons. I hope they use some of them.
[3:19:28] Smeaghoul: @Towelliee Blizz was spending to much time on throw away systems, maybe now they will be able to make more content/dungeons
[3:19:36] Coriollis: I would say after immortal release ?
[3:19:44] Syghtless: 5 weeks
[3:19:44] jpwastaken_: dungeons are about cleave builds because 80% of what u do is clear mob packs, forcing people on single target builds ocassionally because of 10m hp bossfights isnt fun
[3:19:54] de_boinked: @towelliee opinion on fortune blend or the flavor smash of blue ice and sour cherry?
[3:20:15] AwelessOne: I mean I really like the idea of fresh dungeons each season over more dungeons, means less of the same content over 2 years and much easier time for returning players to get back into it
[3:20:25] Bl4ckSauce: So boys are we hyped for this Dragonflight expansion or what
[3:20:37] LegoCoin: I hope its a short alpha/beta I really like surprises
[3:20:49] xraynibba: optimistic @BlackSauceNoodles
[3:21:14] warrenny: @legocoin Not happening last short beta was bfa people hated that
[3:21:15] Bl4ckSauce: I feel the same it look promising
[3:21:23] Bl4ckSauce: looks*
[3:21:28] Lataran: @LegoCoin but thats not how it works
[3:21:51] Nutsy: @BlackSauceNoodles No. I have zero hope for Blizz. Just interested to see what they do from a game dev perspective.
[3:21:56] swordart2022: You farmed this guess what it gets nerfed next season what a joke sounds so lame and punch to face
[3:21:58] flebbooo: yeah idk that just seems really weird
[3:22:01] Korupcija_: doesn't sound like much work compared to SL systems - it's just trinkets no?
[3:22:06] TiredCarcass: that seems like a lot to keep track of
[3:22:09] Truthseeker96: honestly they are doing this cuz they've become lazy imo. they have always released an expansion with a whole list of new dungeons
[3:22:11] griffdog125: sounds like they are outta ideas so pulling shit out thier asses
[3:22:13] Mistery836: or they just make some mythic+ set and make that able to drop on all the dungeons
[3:22:14] QuigsTV: @Towelliee I honestly dont even want them to do that. Maybe ill warm up to it during the expac but rn idk
[3:22:21] Ziddrax: nah all items will be op then nerfed in season 2 LUL
[3:22:24] skaya86: I dont think its too difficult to itemise a dungeon with all those adaptive stats and reusing older skins
[3:22:31] Shearkahn: I mean technically do they have to do that anyways normally?
[3:22:34] Arms_Warrior: its so lazy using 8 old dungeons
[3:22:37] ContraRob: @truthseeker96 They are releasing a whole list of new dungeons, only have of them will have M+ mode
[3:22:45] Bl4ckSauce: @Nutsy Well i've lost my faith long time ago but i usually come back to check out the new expansions
[3:23:13] PokerFaceMoose: i mean you just said you ran last tier raid for a trinket
[3:23:17] Xoan_Dk: my 2 cents...first season all new dungeons, then add old ones if u want

[3:23:45] swordart2022: Cause they fucking nerfed loot by time it drops season ends

[3:23:57] Metket: then you have to hoard all season 1 trinkets hope to be best for season 2
[3:24:04] cahoots82: Just put it all on a vendor and have the dungeons drop a currency for the vendor.
[3:24:15] Truthseeker96: @ContraRob and still using 4 old dungeons seems lazy since you already have the old model to work from.
[3:24:18] ContraRob: @truthseeker96 They've stated the design reason is to have a different set of dungeons for each season, so we aren't regrinding same gear.
[3:24:22] Nutsy: @BlackSauceNoodles Don't expect anything. The information the have given out about the new expansion indicate that they still don't understand the MMORPG genre. Sadly, no game release in the last 12 years has been an MMOrpg.

[3:24:37] Molehj: @the_farting_spaniard LUL
[3:24:38] HD_MOVIE_SOURCE: They would need to uncap valor if you could upgrade from last season @Towelliee

[3:25:30] smashwow: yeah no option is good
[3:25:32] s10g0d: Is there still going to be a vault?
[3:25:40] The_Farting_Spaniard: @felipeaff Everquest? Not sure if that counts
[3:25:47] feherlofia123: karazhan was a bad dungeon please no
[3:25:51] raldrik: trip gems?
[3:26:05] ContraRob: They could just have a currency to buy gear with each season and just change the gear on the vendor to something new each season
[3:26:05] Dackor: since the other 4 will be available on M0, you'll still be able to upgrade it to *almost* max iLvl will Valor, albeit very inefficiently

[3:26:26] gfvaris: maybe you could add teritary stats and gems for the token
[3:26:27] king_julian_96: or  just do what i said have all dragonflight dungeons available on the mythic plus loot table and just add like 1 or 2 old dungeons and with every season rotate the 2 old dungeons around with different old dungeons and just ad a new dragonflight dungeon very patch that's what i would do
[3:26:28] Nutsy: The vault is good.
[3:26:29] reaperofbeardz: @BlackSauceNoodles any game with a large amount of people is an MMORPG even if you disagree thats what it is

[3:38:14] vadder_fister: bm 1button class they deserve no less
[3:38:16] UpSlash: We had a 3300io tank leave our group because the hunter was in BM spec
[3:38:16] SilkeySmooth: actually arms warriors are the example as well..lol
[3:38:16] Aggravius: no king rules forever
[3:38:16] vireosgaming: is marksman viable somewhat still?
[3:38:18] reaperofbeardz: a better BM tier set would be, Increase cleave damage by 10% per mob hit
[3:38:22] Smeaghoul: @Critcobain macro makes it instant...
[3:38:24] AwelessOne: BM just needs to learn from survival and strap bombs to their pets
[3:38:28] Kinghorn: good morning all lgwWave

[3:39:14] Smeaghoul: @Critcobain so was mine, and you get your last target
[3:39:15] reaperofbeardz: MM and SV are almost equal, but survival pulls slightly ahead
[3:39:17] warrenny: Beast master?
[3:39:26] vireosgaming: i would play survival but i don't have nearly as much fun as MM
[3:39:39] Smeaghoul: BM's fine
[3:39:40] mmrghost7: surv hunters are all like 3.6k score , they are slapping
[3:39:41] Cannibalistic_1: it was either make it viable or take it out lol, other than now it was used my what 1% of huntards lol
[3:39:42] CritcobainTV: @Smeaghoul with the macro i just typd out you don't even have to change targets, it just auto misdirects your pet, generally preferred

[3:43:08] duffluv22: Thursday  babby
[3:43:10] Bottletoke: I feel like Evoker will be the most underwhelming class ever released.
[3:43:10] warrenny: @ragingpunk we get meta right
[3:43:15] kamikazis: u was a hybrid spec on mine, unholy frost
[3:43:19] SilkeySmooth: yep nerfd dks at wrath launch
[3:43:19] Niksen_99: Troll rogue is sick in wrath Kreygasm
[3:43:20] fewyn: my team has no first round picks so i'm not paying attention
[3:43:31] RagingPunk: @warrenny meta?
[3:43:32] duffluv22: Steelers draft Malik!!!!!!
[3:43:43] warrenny: @ragingpunk Demonology
[3:43:49] RagingPunk: @warrenny oh yea metamorphasis yes
[3:44:02] sleepy_anko: DH was the most underwhelming....
[3:44:03] warrenny: @ragingpunk Sweet
[3:44:03] Aquadriel: na, most underwhelming is DK, just as the expansion it came with
[3:44:07] CaptainZiman: are we ready for dps DKs with frost aura again?
[3:44:09] reaperofbeardz: well it depends how it plays, people might hate the play style of it or get bored of ranged or healer only and switch
[3:44:10] Malarick: first day of the draft is my wife's birthday.... towCry
[3:44:13] CritcobainTV: Everybody was dragon fighting, towByah their wings were fast as lightning
[3:44:15] waynef1985: evoker will be crazy strong... imagine the backlash if they are only mediocre
[3:44:22] Coriollis: if I learned anything form WoW is that each new class will be op on release for 2 patches :)
[3:44:24] kamikazis: Wonder what weapons they get evokers
[3:44:29] Nokterian: I think that as well
[3:44:32] SilkeySmooth: 3.3.5 was nerfed dks
[3:44:37] CritcobainTV: it's the last patch just like the last 2 classics
[3:44:43] snake_like: I think the issue with new classes is they cannibalize existing ones and are very mechanically simple. See demom hunter
[3:44:46] FrankTizzle: 25 DKs doing OS3D was stupid
[3:44:46] fewyn: wrath is already DOA

[3:50:10] vulkankragon: patch 3.3.5 also means unlimited mana for casters, so no eating and drinking inbetween fights
[3:50:10] ThePawPaw: #NoChanges btw
[3:50:15] MDF2393: wait  till the sell some 68 boosts
[3:50:31] reggiepowa: the only point of lfg is for leveling dungeons, at max it shouldnt work

[3:51:09] Sheckly84: oh that's right, wasn't 3.3.5 one-button arcane mages?
[3:51:16] CritcobainTV: dungeon finder didn't originally launch until like halfway through the xpac right? Id k why it's such a big deal right now lol
[3:51:27] dreamwalker213: @niksen_99 pretty sure people would still be boosting with LFG

[5:02:59] its_yegs: ads? KEKW
[5:03:02] Robodope: @Metket but changing talents within a loadout is the same as swapping to a different loadout.  why would they allow the former but not the latter
[5:03:03] Kyuubii20: KEKW adss
[5:03:04] Sollice: I hate ads on this channel....OH WAIT

[5:03:37] Metket: @Robodope i mean if you do 10 loadouts ready for al your situations then you don't ever need a book
[5:03:45] R0NGG: KEKW
[5:03:46] DeanoTV: not everyone can sub

[5:04:11] mavericks312: a lower tier first boss could be galakrond
[5:04:11] Praetour: I think Crimson Whelpling from Wetlands will be final boss
[5:04:12] warrenny: Nah galakrond
[5:04:14] GiveLoveLive: Galakrond
[5:04:15] Radiatedpeanut: probably galakron

[5:04:27] aladinsane909: Old god corrupted chromie will be the last boss
[5:04:28] Aggravius: magni final boss
[5:04:34] Robodope: @Metket yeah that's why I speculate that even swapping a loadout requires using a book.  it's just a UI shortcut to respeccing talents (which requires a book).  but I mean who knows, they could do anything.
[5:04:42] PvtHudson093: It will be the evil incestuous spawn of Neferion and Onixya
[5:04:45] GriFFFoN_ZGZ: Galakrond will be end boss for sure

[5:05:01] sifer007: KEKW
[5:05:01] Balkep: time to bring back islands Kappa
[5:05:02] Sollice: If we are fighting Galakrond, then we are going to have to travel back in time via Bronze
[5:05:10] TheCliffyShow: Chromatus, Galakron, Murzonad. There's plenty of great dragon villais out there. We don't need to be bringing back ones like Nefarian, Onyxia, and Deathwing.
[5:05:14] wreckshoptv: buuu
[5:05:15] Mordeaur: FeelsBadMan
[5:05:19] Robodope: @Metket yeah if you can just swap loadouts anytime, scribes will be pissed lol
[5:05:23] Praetour: Chromatus would be an AWESOME final boss
[5:05:24] MethmM: sounding more like mop
[5:05:31] mavericks312: outdoor dungeons confirmed?
[5:05:34] aladinsane909: Man Ion learned japanese in week just for this interview, respect

[5:05:36] luckfore: thats cool, more focus on the outdoor world
[5:05:37] Aidler: island expeditions…. but more important Kappa
[5:05:38] Metket: @Robodope definitely, dead book all exp
[5:05:39] Keyastaron_: sorry its  Wrathion i was talking about for the boss Kappa

[5:06:04] Sollice: @TheCliffyShow Yep thats a possibility also. Either way time travel would have to be involved
[5:06:04] Roaringkittylol: Creative way of saying Chorghast was unsuccessful
[5:06:04] smashwow: omg it's not Japanese. it's Korean

[5:07:31] WundertueteGER: change all affixes 🙏
[5:07:32] brentosxd: just do the new 8 + the old ones
[5:07:33] stallowned: 🤔
[5:07:34] mavericks312: i love this idea
[5:07:34] DrakeDuude: not a farn of the 4 new dungeons and 4 old ones. i want all 8 upfront
[5:07:35] Keyastaron_: MISTS OF PANDARIA M+ POG
[5:07:35] dehash1: seems weird doing old dungeons when the expac is fresh
[5:07:35] Nintetzu: that will be nice
[5:07:37] its____rooster: so that means we have to farm 2 sets of gear or more for each season
[5:07:38] Skrapp: i'd love older dungeons being M+
[5:07:40] JWoody82: This is a move that will feel bad s1 of this xpac, but will be great for M+ long term
[5:07:40] Dallywacker: ehhh
[5:07:40] darkeagle7561: Yeah I think this is cool tbh
[5:07:41] snackpakahoy0: Mythic Deadmines!!!
[5:07:42] HaxzorJimDuggan: im all for this
[5:07:42] Virtualhaggis: Why not just release 8 dungeons every patch - that's what we want
[5:07:42] wreckshoptv: or sunken tempel
[5:07:42] Shirey36: we want more
[5:07:45] Coriollis: this is realy good hope it translates good too
[5:07:46] Praetour: So is it 8 dungeons released normal through mythic but only 4 in m+?
[5:07:47] aladinsane909: M+ wailing caverns pog
[5:07:48] reformedalex12345: people that wont manage to get loot from previous season will be bitching about this
[5:07:50] DrakeDuude: i don't want to do old dungeons as part of my current expansion content
[5:07:50] Carahail: fix the affix's Plz
[5:07:51] EmpathyLiveChat: Omg, this is so lazy. I don't mind it but it signifies their lack of investment
[5:07:52] Mitune: They should cycle 2 each week the current dungeons at least to give 10 dungeons overall
[5:07:52] toocheap2rhyme: completely new BiS list each season
[5:07:54] AureliusXV: bunch of 1500k andys in here

[5:08:00] Truthseeker96: @rdnkrooster thats what ive been trying to say
[5:08:01] swordart2022: WHY NOT ADD 4 on top of IT
[5:08:04] Mozzi_IRL: im not sure i like that idea
[5:08:06] swordart2022: Why just 8???????????
[5:08:14] EmpathyLiveChat: WHY DON'T THEY JUST HAVE US LEVELLING IN OLD ZONES TOO
[5:08:20] Lazugo: Im not going to drtag my ass to fucking deadmines to socket the key in

[5:09:51] Jelanipatron: It’s not recycled content for everyone. For a big portion of the community.. 4 “old” dungeons is brand new to them

[5:09:52] swordart2022: @Sneekzx are you fucking joking 1billion yearly , we are getting scammed .
[5:10:02] Milanesa_De_Pollo: I hope season 1 is the 8 new dungeons
[5:10:02] IianaDRK: im fine with 4 DF dungeons 4 old dungeons season rotation
[5:10:05] Waiden01: He is correct. Running 8 dungeons for 2 years is shit

[5:10:31] ImCancakes: i agree, season 1 should just be 8 DF dungeons
[5:10:31] Mitune: add 2 more current dungeons that rotate each week @Towelliee
[5:10:32] swordart2022: gives us 12 simple as that
[5:10:32] dehash1: just do all new dungeons in s1, then rotate old in next season
[5:10:34] Lazugo: I just want a teleporter to the old dungeons
[5:10:35] KingSlayerYotam: we can do 8 legion dungeons
[5:10:35] Naethix: I just want them to react to things not working out fast.
[5:10:35] IianaDRK: id expect season 3 to be the season 1 df dungeons
[5:10:38] AureliusXV: have to reun the same dungeaon every season for the same trinkets
[5:10:38] JWoody82: Adding old dungeons to the rotation is needed, hopefully the community doesn't stop a good idea before it happens
[5:10:42] Kisswani: to be fair , it's only old dungeons if you played previous expansions Kappa
[5:10:45] NennanPie: I think it would be nice to have season 1 being all 8 new dungeons then separate them out after and do 4 old 4 new

[5:10:46] AureliusXV: shits get bopring
[5:10:48] Truthseeker96: Dude i think they are aiming to get classic players to come back to retail with the level squish we got in shadowlands and by also including old but updated competitive dungeons inside M+
[5:10:54] SkiaTheShade: yeah, the same fucking thing
[5:10:55] flebbooo: yep its about that time
[5:10:57] lornthok: all 8 dungeons for s1 for sure
[5:10:58] Lazugo: im not getting 100 loading screens to get to old dungeons
[5:10:59] reaperofbeardz: i want to get rid of tyrannical despise and hate it, its why i dont do keys on it
[5:10:59] reggiepowa: what if you miss a season and never get to see some dragonflight dungeons in m+?
[5:11:01] KingSlayerYotam: we need KISS affixes like in torghast
[5:11:01] c0mmander_starscream: I hope Blizz changes up the dev team they need new fucking blood
[5:11:04] Truthseeker96: its 5Head
[5:11:04] mavericks312: s3 would mostlikely be the .2 patch which means a mega dungeon mostlikely
[5:11:09] TacDuc: End of expansion could easily be more dungeons than before, as at that point we have a much longer season
[5:11:09] the_general01: i mean, the dungeon splits are only for m+ im pretty sure we'll have all 8 on release
[5:11:10] SkiaTheShade: i like the rotating dungeon idea though! i'm exhausted running the same ones over and over for 2 years

[5:11:24] Sneekzx: @fairplay2021 For maybe the % of people who have played since classic. There's a huge portion of people (including myself) who haven't even done more than 20% of all dungeons, so I'm on board. Can't please everyone tho
[5:11:24] Molvonos: I hope they fix the primary affixes.  Fortified and Tyrannical are so boring.
[5:11:28] Syghtless: i would literally be happy if they only kept seasonal affixes, all others are just ruining fun or hindering gameplay @Towelliee

[5:11:38] adeekoowy: So they have to rework old dungeons to look "good" in m+.
[5:11:39] Clicklesly: Or they mix it more and S3 is just Dragonflight M+ and S4 is the 8 old ones Kappa
[5:11:42] Spaede: Spaede subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 33 months! 
[5:11:42] EmpathyLiveChat: I guess I don't mind it either
[5:11:43] reaperofbeardz: the halondrus nerf is ridiculous in my opinion from 10 - 30s is insane
[5:11:47] SpoofAvatar: Nerfs to Halondrus just as Ion's guild gets to Halondrus, LUL
[5:11:47] Robodope: they should every week pick an old season affix and make it affect 1 dungeon that week randomly
[5:11:48] snackpakahoy0: ehhhhhhhh im wishy washy i have to see how it is first to be honest
[5:11:52] Dallywacker: totally agree with that
[5:11:54] Aquadriel: @Towelliee hope they do more interviews with people like you, max, sloot etc like on SL alpha
[5:11:56] Truthseeker96: All 8 new dungeons will be available for Mythic but only 4 for M+
[5:11:56] Shirey36: we have timewalking for a reason LUL
[5:11:57] Kisswani: maybe in the interview prep they indicated that this is not something they will be answering at this point ?
[5:11:59] swordart2022: I want 12 and more 8 is joke
[5:11:59] TheCliffyShow: That's my opinion to @Towelliee.
[5:11:59] MILESkg21: 30 sec what KEKW
[5:12:10] mavericks312: those nerfs are disappointing
[5:12:12] IianaDRK: it suck tho if we did all the DF dungeons in season 1 then had no DF dungeons for the rest of the expansion
[5:12:19] raye_gaming22: now every trash wr 500 guild can clear it xD
[5:12:19] StoicTaurus: if you start with 8 dragonflight, then in 2nd Season 4 of those would repeat..
[5:12:19] Aquadriel: more like HaLOLdrus KEKW
[5:12:21] dehash1: esentially 4 of the dungeons will be dead on arrival, you'll only do them a few times on mythic and thats it
[5:12:22] Kisswani: meh , you still got 4 more bosses to prog on . it's fine
[5:12:24] TheCheeseWheel87: Seems like the 4 new season 1 and 4 new season 2 would be a way for them to drag out content IMO
[5:12:25] borgking82: @Towelliee I'm over Fortified and Tyrannical as a tank
[5:12:29] Scoodles91: first try today :D
[5:12:37] TheCliffyShow: Will feel like a unearned kill. Blizzard wants to taint your victory.
[5:12:39] SixxAxxiS1: Hey Towel! Good Morning! Finally able to catch your stream!
[5:12:42] swordart2022: I thin nerf cause 7.2.5 in 3 months
[5:12:46] mavericks312: that fight is legit dead now
[5:12:47] IianaDRK: anduin got ANOTHER nerf?
[5:12:48] Aidler: if I understood correctly all 8 dungeons will be there at the start… just not for M+
[5:12:48] Robodope: perfect timing for our raid EZ Clap
[5:12:53] swordart2022: *9.2.5
[5:12:54] Aquadriel: @Towelliee he got the outlaw rogue treatment, completely decimated KEKW
[5:12:54] TheCliffyShow: Halondrus is a softshell crab now.
[5:13:09] Vendralos: Ha LUL drus
[5:13:12] QuigsTV: id like for them to do 12 dungeons with all 8 Dragonflight dungeons and the other 4 being the dungeons from older expacs
[5:13:15] MILESkg21: next patch must be real soon then KEKW
[5:13:16] Kisswani: @Aidler yeah that's what i got from it as well . they will be available for M0 and stuff
[5:13:18] Metket: guilds can reunite now KEKW
[5:13:18] swordart2022: @Aidler ye imagine you have conent in front of you and cant play will be dead as Tazavesh was total joke.
[5:13:20] Praetour: @Aidler I think that was the gist, 4 dragonflight and 4 old dungeons for season 1 then the other 4 will be used for season 2
[5:13:24] Truthseeker96: @Aidler yup
[5:13:28] its____rooster: @Towelliee Season 1: all 8, Season 2:  4 new 4 old, Season 3: 4 new 4 old Season 4: should include a new mega-dung
[5:13:30] swordart2022: @QuigsTV same
[5:13:43] 3663Sharad: Ions guild reached Halondrus it seems KEKW
[5:13:44] Motraxtv: So what you are saying is that he is already dead on your screen?
[5:13:49] swordart2022: why just 8??????
[5:14:07] GOATofGrowth: Mr Towel, will you have OW2 drops tomorrow?
[5:14:07] xrandomdoodx: @Towelliee do you think these massive nerfs mean they want to push 9.2.5 out more sooner than later?
[5:14:10] Kifimbo: they want people that would be good alpha testers to be done with the current xpac, so they can take their breaks before they start testing
[5:14:14] Shirey36: should be 10 plus mega
[5:14:15] Keyastaron_: 18 @Towelliee  would be TO MUCH for M+
[5:14:16] TheCliffyShow: Not yet
[5:14:19] its____rooster: no
[5:14:19] Shrenko: Overwatch 2 video @Towelliee
[5:14:21] reggiepowa: 8 is not enough
[5:14:21] raye_gaming22: they are just a dps checks and now as we have gear lords are free we recealred them last week with only 3 wipes
[5:14:22] Dallywacker: still not
[5:14:29] babadookz1251: Deadmines mythic plus
[5:14:31] Tschetter21: Some new bg's and ebg's would be a nice addition
[5:14:32] its____rooster: where did you get that wallpaper
[5:14:33] luckfore: why create new dungoens when you can use old ones lol
[5:14:41] Big_Wanshan: less dungeons and expacs every year
[5:14:43] IianaDRK: u got to remember they expect people to do double that for meta mounts. so its 16 already
[5:14:43] ChefDaddy1928: I feel like most people wait to clear Mythic until the nerfs lol
[5:14:47] LordKain73: 8 is enough
[5:14:50] 1s2real: Watch videos and react
[5:14:54] Baylix: 8 is fine lol
[5:14:58] Zerfell: 8 is enough lol
[5:15:00] borgking82: @Towelliee I'm over Fortified and Tyrannical as a tank what do you think ?
[5:15:02] TheRealAxiom: Or you need a trinket from a dungeon thats not in the pool...feelsbad
[5:15:03] swordart2022: nope legion > rest.
[5:15:06] Keyastaron_: 8 enough 18 too much 10-12 good enough
[5:15:08] mavericks312: 8 is enough when your also redoing old dungeons
[5:15:11] swordart2022: You can choose to run le ss chat :P
[5:15:11] SpoofAvatar: 18 too many
[5:15:12] reggiepowa: I mean its fine on launch but we rly need 12-14 dungeons by the end of the expansion
[5:15:13] Grizly922: true
[5:15:17] Grizly922: 10 is good
[5:15:18] Mitune: Shorter seasons would be better, but I am not a huge fan of m+. Get bored of it fast
[5:15:22] Kisswani: I think people pointed out that Halondrus nerfs came 3 weeks later than when Painsmith nerfs came . if anything they held on the nerfs longer than usual
[5:15:22] 3663Sharad: More is always better. Money, Donuts, you nam it LUL
[5:15:23] ZHSpar1an: 12 dungueons for m+ is a nightmare for casuals
[5:15:24] flebbooo: yeah its like why settle with 8 when we could have 10-12
[5:15:31] Grizly922: i want it like legion
[5:15:34] Grizly922: that was good
[5:15:37] luckfore: BFA had 10 on start
[5:15:38] chopsaki: wrath had 16.. pepperidgefarm remembers
[5:15:38] IianaDRK: upper dragon karazhan and lower dragon karazhan
[5:15:40] Keyastaron_: Upper Kara was such a pain
[5:15:43] Naethix: dungeons have to be easier. I can't stand fighting trash that has 5 abilities or more @Towelliee
[5:15:44] Fangy_Playz: So why is it lately raids towards the end lately have like in the last three bosses of the raid heres a hard one followed by a Meh, then followed by the actual raid boss?

[5:15:48] Malitor: do you think if they did all 8 first, then season 2 they took 4 of them away that people would be mad also?
[5:15:48] Praetour: @3663Sharad except eyes, 3 is a bit odd
[5:15:51] mmrghost7: the idea of old dungs is gonna back fire ,i am 100% sure of that
[5:15:52] 1s2real: Can you imagine KSM
[5:15:55] cofrom512: as long as they are good dungeons 8 solid ones are better than 12 and 4 suck
[5:15:57] ArcaneSyntax: if you exclude palette swap dungeons from previous expansions 8 isn't that bad.

[5:16:15] luckfore: new dungeons always so overtuned..
[5:16:18] IianaDRK: if they bring back ZA and ZG as M+ im going to lose my shit. i love those dungeons
[5:16:22] reaperofbeardz: Towelliee i still wish for 10 man Mythic raids, would be so much easier for guilds with lack of players

[5:20:52] TheRealAxiom: Make it random where you dont know until you start the key
[5:20:56] ChrisarN: will 9.2.5 revitalize M+?
[5:20:57] darssia_: and 10 dungeons becomes 20 dungeons and no one wants that.
[5:20:57] xrandomdoodx: Im tired of sanguine, explosive, necrotic, bolstering etc lmao
[5:20:58] WundertueteGER: this
[5:21:00] Praetour: Positive affixes would be amazing
[5:21:02] Naxeroth: tyrannical and fortified has educational purpose on the start - this is important to know which abilities can one shot you whether its boss or mobs @Towelliee
[5:21:03] cahoots82: I don't mind fortified. I think fortified is fine. Tyrannical is giga-ass though

[5:21:24] QuigsTV: or skittish
[5:21:29] Nowaayjose: Any hopes for the vault?
[5:21:31] MrGharr: Instead of 8% scaling give it 10-12% and add fun and only positive affixes.
[5:21:39] Keyastaron_: @Towelliee  they should give us the +10 affixes from past expacs LUL
[5:21:39] Sandisy: wish they made it less grindy with every pack having some sort of oneshot ability

[5:22:05] Dyasis: yes
[5:22:05] Zendero89: no

[5:22:09] ThePawPaw: @Helyiolasz give affixxes when you doing something you are rewarded
[5:22:09] LeDerpski: only tier
[5:22:09] sotsil_: nop
[5:22:09] georgedavies1996: do regolondeez
[5:22:10] mavericks312: i think the vault could be the saving grace to the 4 new m+ rotation
[5:22:10] QuigsTV: @Towelliee I need pants or boots
[5:22:11] panzmat: only tier is available
[5:22:11] endobleedz: @Towelliee  only tier
[5:22:11] cahoots82: You can get tier drops regardless of what bosses you killed
[5:22:15] panzmat: you gotta kill boss for other loot
[5:22:18] fillefaren: wait so u can actually get jailer weapon? @Towelliee
[5:22:18] mrniceguy817: Yea give us reaping affix again please Ty danCe
[5:22:19] cahoots82: but only tier
[5:22:22] Goatsguffle: 29 MINUTES UNTIL I GET TO WEEP
[5:22:26] tatrick94: NP. Youre the goat
[5:22:30] doomkry: i just hope with the reworked talent system some classes can have better utility like double time on fury warrior with storm bolt and more healers with interrupts
[5:22:38] phantom1353: Tier gear from vault works differently than non tier
[5:22:44] Praetour: Is MDI still on?
[5:22:45] Sandisy: maybe they let the vault give out loot from the 4 not currently in the rotation
[5:22:47] fillefaren: The vault is like christmas eve every wednesday
[5:22:52] postman_quest: Classic stratholme as mythic +
[5:22:52] its_yegs: im finally getting my 4 piece today boys!
[5:22:54] its____rooster: do you think there will be an item level increase and KSM achievement in Season 4? @Towelliee
[5:22:54] georgedavies1996: Has wow always had a weekly thing like the vault or chest
[5:22:55] Nowaayjose: DONT FIX THE DAMN WHEEL
[5:22:56] Vendralos: I want the Vault to be a giant pile of Gold to keep with the Dragon theme
[5:22:58] mavericks312: but what im saying is the vault could reward gear from dungeons not in rotation
[5:22:59] 3v3r35t_: Which classes would you like to see reworked

[5:23:11] Mitune: I do hope they test the talents on PTR even if its one class at a time
[5:23:17] ThePawPaw: Alpha yeah mostly new class and dungs there and there some zone
[5:23:18] MethmM: cant wait for u to test the evoker class, wanna see how it is like
[5:23:25] Shallo1988: new class?
[5:23:28] fillefaren: The vault is like christmas eve every wednesday :D
[5:23:32] doomkry: @Towelliee maybe they can also rework the deplete concept for not timing keys
[5:23:35] After43ver: hope 10 is unreal good
[5:23:38] Scoodles91: and the class
[5:23:38] Fangy_Playz: Introducing the new weekly WHEEL OF FORTUNE come spin the wheel to see if you get currency or a piece of gear!
[5:23:40] Fangy_Playz: LUL
[5:23:40] Keyastaron_: @Towelliee  blizzard should give players ALL THE LOOT from M+ / raid or PVP honor selections ( depending on what you did the most that week ) AKA all 3 slots
[5:23:43] warrenny: Long prepatch with evoker? @towelliee
[5:23:47] adeekoowy: Next deep dive august? With release date?
[5:23:58] its____rooster: new class will be META season 1 lol
[5:23:59] StraightErro: @Towelliee How about for vault, you can choose a handful of gear slots you want want the loot to pull from? Like you really want a weapon/helm/ring sorta thing, no boots!
[5:24:08] Kifimbo: What about making the vault also available BEFORE max level, supporting people doing things prior to hitting cap
[5:24:09] maalow: like every new class evoker will be broken no worries
[5:24:11] fillefaren: @keyastaron_ so you wanna be max level on 2 weeks?
[5:24:14] mrniceguy817: Better vault make it like a poker hand you can choose a item to hold and reroll the other slots
[5:24:16] reaperofbeardz: evoker would be awesome as a tank, tank form could be like guardian, a mini dragon form
[5:24:19] Praetour: @warrenny they start at 58 so would probably only be a month ro two
[5:24:20] mavericks312: cause ya know borrowed power is bad apparently
[5:24:22] 1s2real: The new class is gunna be so much fun
[5:24:24] ericscicluna: so borrowed power fill finally stop?
[5:24:27] 1s2real: Can’t wait to level one up to 70
[5:24:29] Baylix: Do you think the class will even be in pre patch when they have their own zone then into DF zones? How would we play them past that
[5:24:29] Fangy_Playz: Could you imagine if it was a wheel you spun one a week like the damn casino in GTA? LUL
[5:24:30] Thenickradice: you're in the alpha? @towelliee
[5:24:35] ericscicluna: no more grinding shit ?
[5:24:37] wildbillee: I'm hoping with less borrowed power systems, the expansion will be more alt friendly
[5:24:41] SlowMoJoe_TV: besides panda whats the best ww monk race
[5:24:43] pigzip: @towelliee So what lvl do the new race start at ?
[5:24:44] Hupu_a: or what you dont need
[5:24:46] IronLiebe: IronLiebe subscribed with Prime. 
[5:24:47] MILESkg21: Targeted Loot ??
[5:24:49] reluctantcow: think we will b able to solo BFA raids at 70?
[5:24:54] coldhandsbeatz: They should have so much more dev time next expansions due to the huge amount that costs the new talents
[5:24:56] Robodope: just let me buy the item I want after a month
[5:24:58] reaperofbeardz: @pigzip 58 they said
[5:25:02] Dyasis: @Grafik_Live BE
[5:25:04] After43ver: Classic Talent style with hidden mega DPS
[5:25:04] Mr_Moo5e: good mornin @Towelliee hope you're doing well
[5:25:04] Mitune: That would be nice. Let us target look with it
[5:25:08] Arms_Warrior: if u could blacklist belts from dropping cuz u got a good one.
[5:25:11] Baylix: @pigzip 58
[5:25:15] Altered8: what flavor you got man
[5:25:15] Metket: imagine they skip alpha for towelliee Kappa
[5:25:15] Vendralos: Or have it remove a handful of slots that you don't need, to increase your odds of getting what you want
[5:25:16] mavericks312: @Reluctance3609 the way they handled legion legacy dmg probably not lol
[5:25:19] Altered8: what you smokin
[5:25:23] KodyTheTyger: I’d rather be able to pick an instance that I want loot to be pulled from.
[5:25:25] srs_business: I think they'll go back to borrowed power next expansion, since the talent system will no longer be new and refreshing. Hopefully they'll have learned their lessons by then
[5:25:30] Mistery836: rather have a system like the vault, with if you don't like the loot, you can get currency to buy the same gear from a vendor instead
[5:25:31] mrniceguy817: I do wish we could turn off getting tier from the vault
[5:25:34] TheCliffyShow: But my systems!
[5:25:39] MOLAR305: so can we expect a Deep Breath sub notification for dragon flight?
[5:25:41] GamerKillance: Don't forget Microsoft is now going to be in control. They aren't going to let that bullshit like before go
[5:25:43] Praetour: Targeting lowest ilvl slot or something might be good
[5:25:43] reaperofbeardz: @Towelliee only thing i fear is talent system becoming basic cookie cutter people only running the OP builds like previous expansions
[5:25:45] Keyastaron_: @imbadkekw no if you dont have upgrades from the vault you can choose 1 of 3 items  2 of 3 of 3 of 3 items os not really LUL thatd be good for season 4 of DF

[5:25:48] Dyasis: @Towelliee Don't forget testing the new profession system
[5:25:48] warrenny: @praetour True but its prob gonna be at almost a year till it comes out why not make them available as soon as they’re ready give us a reasonto plsy
[5:25:51] Thenickradice: agreed, just focusing on talents makes power feel more meaningful.
[5:25:54] ThePawPaw: but i need to farm some AP Kappa
[5:25:57] PvtHudson093: I would rather have a token that allows you to re-roll a slot of your vault
[5:26:04] Aquadriel: burp noises Pog
[5:26:13] odinsdad75: maybe the vault will drop upgraded versions of the loot from the 4 dungeons not being use?
[5:26:15] After43ver: is blizzcon On this year?
[5:26:15] Naturalbeef: Just tweak to not get duplicate items and give a higher chance for your lower iLevel items
[5:26:19] Fangy_Playz: But what if we want Ony casting deep breath?
[5:26:20] Mr_Moo5e: I remember when the new talent system was released, they emphasized trying to break the "meta" and let people play what they want. Do you think the dragonflight talents is them giving up on fighting "the meta"?
[5:26:28] doomkry: bringing back bonus token would also be cool or reforging system
[5:26:29] georgedavies1996: every week you can cross off an item that you dont want in the vault
[5:26:31] tamer_bayne: is this retail or alpha he is trying to get into ?
[5:26:35] Wildsmasher: 2023 blizzcon hype
[5:26:39] Wildsmasher: slootDrunk slootDrunk slootDrunk
[5:26:41] Altered8: diablo 4?
[5:26:42] mavericks312: what would they announce at blizzcon?
[5:26:42] GamerKillance: Fact we're getting day 1 flying says a lot about whats going on behind the scenes. The stupid anti-fly war they started they lost
[5:26:43] ThePawPaw: DIABLO 4 Kappa
[5:26:45] Praetour: @warrenny yeah that's fair, I imagine they'd be one of the first things on alpha too
[5:26:45] MILESkg21: OnlyWatch POGGERS
[5:26:45] Wildsmasher: only been 4 years
[5:26:45] Nowaayjose: Towelliee u ever smoke a bong ?
[5:26:46] Metket: 11.0 Hype
[5:26:48] TheCliffyShow: I predict Dragonflight season 1 affix is something to be some elemental type stuff. Like bosses have extra elemental damage. Or, there's patches of fire occasionally. Or, a dragon swoops in and shoots fire at you sometimes.
[5:26:48] reaperofbeardz: give us back tokens to reroll
[5:26:51] Keyastaron_: i think they already cancelled blizcon
[5:26:57] mandarinetip: 11.0?
[5:26:59] warrenny: @mr_moo5e Probably i mean look at how covenants turned out

[5:29:32] Praetour: Wasnt it rumored to be a slime cat pet?
[5:29:37] StraightErro: @Towelliee think every dracthyr are gonna deep breath themselves off ledges to death will become a meme? like DH fel rushing off a cliff
[5:29:37] vision42g: prolly mount
[5:29:46] TheCliffyShow: Dragon Fire affix, call in a red dragon to douse an area in flames to do damage to enemies. But, be careful. Because players can get damaged by it to.
[5:29:46] D3m0nHunt3r666: ialennParty ialennPepeDS ialennParty ialennPepeDS

[5:29:55] aladinsane909: Bronze dragonflight affix: your movement speed and cast speed is slowed by 75% for whole dungeon
[5:29:56] ArcaneSyntax: the DF beta might have drops!
[5:29:57] Thenickradice: as a feral druid main, seeing that dragonflight talent tree has me pumped right now.
[5:29:57] warrenny: @unkn0wn42g Wait for the outrage
[5:30:14] boopbopbamski: when do you think they will let people pre order dragoons?
[5:30:23] ArcaneSyntax: I mean, necros already have slime cat pet
[5:30:31] Praetour: Runescape do membership for prime it works for them
[5:30:34] Mitune: 14 days of game time would at least get my to come back a bit for the time being
[5:30:45] coldhandsbeatz: 14 days of game time  would be great tbh
[5:30:47] hatsihansu: that would reduce the hassle of beta keys
[5:31:11] WundertueteGER: MoP beta best beta
[5:31:11] Fangy_Playz: So how long into Alpha do you think they'll remove a NDA
[5:31:17] DJ_PWNZ: @towelliee maybe that’s what they need
[5:31:19] endobleedz: mil doesnt play wow
[5:31:20] Fangy_Playz: Like right before beta?
[5:31:20] Praetour: @Towelliee but it sounds like they're leaning more on youtube as a partner than twitch going forward so I can't imagine it'd be twitch drops only sort of thing
[5:31:21] RhadigarTV: Never @fangy_playz
[5:31:22] reaperofbeardz: @Towelliee id love to see m+ ranks similar to PVP where more lvls you have you get cool cosmetic loots or mounts, would make me want to grind M+ more
[5:31:26] feherlofia123: they should increase the trial max level lol 20 is nothing
[5:31:28] Metket: yeah they are giving keys to ppl where they don't play at all KEKW
[5:31:30] SnoWeazel: you really think that many ppl would play beta?

[5:32:14] Fangy_Playz: @Towelliee Back to the old faithful joke. Panda will have keys somehow
[5:32:19] Templexx: you ever play pre-alphas?
[5:32:19] Nutsy: Do you know when the next "good day" will be? :)
[5:32:25] Thenickradice: @towelliee they should change the "reconnect" button to "resurrect"
[5:32:29] DogShep: Last NDA I've seen for MMOs was GW2 tech alpha lol
[5:32:33] ArcaneSyntax: listen a lot of the community has really terrible ideas KEW

[6:44:35] FrankTizzle: But i doubt it
[6:44:44] CritcobainTV: @ItsXolten that means u originally used a 252 piece of gear from m+. Sandworn gear can NOT be upgraded
[6:44:52] stabzmcgeee: @ItsXolten so thats not sandworn gear then
[6:45:22] dwolf010: they always have said GEARING is never going to be acount wide. i doubt they will just give you normal raid level gear

[6:45:41] Molvonos: brizziHmm
[6:45:42] smashwow: either way that doesn't feel like it should be upgradeable AFTER you turn it into tier. basically you're converting it to raid gear. and raid gear isn't upgradeable
[6:45:54] CritcobainTV: @ItsXolten And u said u CAN upgrade it. the guy was asking about sandworn, not mythic plus gear lol
[6:46:13] CritcobainTV: it keeps the properties of the gear you used, so it makes sense
[6:46:27] RalgorStreams: I feel like they might be afraid to make everything account wide bc then people won’t play as much but I would for sure be playing more bc I’d be playing alts.
