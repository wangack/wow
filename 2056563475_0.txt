[2:45:01] Searow: I guess the word: "fcking" is allowed, but with the u in it its not haha
[2:45:25] Searow: I truly think those compilation videos, as a funny act, are extremely briliant and generally do very well with the audience
[2:45:41] Searow: Your old videos with fury of arms pvp etc did very well right? With Bajuthor etc
[2:45:50] Ljscrubs: Wats everyone doing in retail now?

[2:47:40] orangewatermelon: Is there a reason you dont do twitter much anymore? just curious!
[2:47:56] Searow: @Ljscrubs To be honest, I stepped away from Blizz after MOP. I loved the simplicity of wrath so I went to private. First I felt like a loser, but now I feel like its the best decision I made. Enjoying what you like is most important
[2:48:34] orangewatermelon: no im totally wrong, it didnt organize your tweets by date, im sorry! thats strange
