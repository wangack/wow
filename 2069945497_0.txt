[9:44:24] Ayjayyy: well tbf, pulling like that issss a bit aggro compared to what most people are used to
[9:44:41] Ayjayyy: this is gigaoptimized
[9:45:26] Ayjayyy: i think lock tank would be better tho, cuz they have a ten minute AOE taunt which could be used once per dungeon for masssssss mage dmg
[9:45:56] Ayjayyy: you know the tech haha
[9:46:19] Ayjayyy: cuz with mages at soem point its about positioning more than actually tanking the mobs

[9:47:39] letsgetgoingyo: doing dungeons is fastest way to level pets. otherwise its a pain in the arse to do
[9:50:21] letsgetgoingyo: it was the same in classic. getting dungeon groups was difficult as rogue and hunter. Too many of them and doesnt bring any buffs
[9:50:25] JDXL: wtf 136k warrior parses
[9:50:54] letsgetgoingyo: now hunters have lion and also good damage (and aoe) but rogues have nothing special, not even damage
