[0:06:17] 210Crawler: Lets do tthhhiiiiissssss
[0:06:45] MrGattz: is it just me or are these changes not that impressive? it seems like blizzard just gave up and is just blanked buffing everything and praying it helps.
[0:06:59] Thoreya: praise the lord for account wide layers
[0:07:46] mo197: hey everyone!
[0:07:57] Sneakzx: Big pog on account wide layers
[0:08:03] CatsRusOfficial: Finally something for survival hunters! Still not enough. But it’s something
[0:08:18] MrGattz: i dont mind the blanket changes but like its lazy.
[0:08:34] MrGattz: or at least it seems that way
[0:08:40] 210Crawler: Still waiting on my Gunnars, should be in any min now!
[0:08:47] Twigz_KC: towHi Good Evening! towHi
[0:08:54] Apokolipz: the battle for the shadowlands has begun

[0:09:03] DuctapeofDoom: overwhelming odds is active again on some worlds
[0:09:08] DuctapeofDoom: might be because of that
[0:09:29] Apokolipz: lmao
[0:09:30] theDirtyon3: @MrGattz its lazy for some classes but others it works because the rotation was already decent

[0:10:05] Thoreya: meh i dont dislike the changes
[0:10:07] MOLAR305: havok AoE is going to end up being a problem lol
[0:10:09] Thoreya: seem pretty nice and easy
[0:10:18] dinomiyte: towHype
[0:10:55] MrGattz: @theDirtyon3 yeahhh see thats like why im in the middle with it. like it *seems* lazy regardless of it working well or not. and its super effective at fixing the problem sure, but its strange that they dont like go in and look to see what specific abilities are the issue. you break more than you fix potentially
[0:11:10] brilargaming: brilar1967 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 47 months! Nearly 4 years of support. Hoping you are doing well. Keep up the great work you are doing
[0:11:30] theDirtyon3: @MrGattz 100% agree its a double edge sword but im sure that they had to consider time spent onthings as well
[0:11:36] dirrtygrrl: Trust me 3% buff to Havoc DH is not going to be gamebreaking in any way. They are still crap unfortunately
[0:11:48] Wildside1177: lol instant queue
[0:12:02] Twigz_KC: I don't understand how it can be such a difficult # crunch for them at this point.... they are receiving the complaints.. they can track the logs... I'm not a programmer, but can't they calculate the % change that needs to occur?
[0:12:11] aimassistallen: Thoughts on the 3% fury buff? Think it’ll have any effects
[0:12:15] idenkaz_: evening good peeps
[0:12:22] Apokolipz: suddenly all the players attack towellie in the dungeon too
[0:12:30] CatsRusOfficial: 3% for DH is nothing right now. But compare it to assassination rouges since realise there total buffs is 20%
[0:12:36] healmore49: what addon do you use for the nameplates?
[0:12:54] aimassistallen: Havoc aoe dmg is crazy rn
[0:13:11] aimassistallen: Without the buff
[0:13:13] MrGattz: @Twigz_KC they track more data that we could possibly imagine in every aspect of the game. with that said i have no idea why they dont just go in and loot to see what the problem is.
[0:13:17] idenkaz_: Max tweeted out a good one about DH and % buffing
[0:14:12] CatsRusOfficial: Do you think that they are doing this for now till 9.1?
[0:14:20] MrGattz: thats exactly what they are doing. they are basically saying here take this and stfu. if there is still a problem let us know later
[0:14:50] Twigz_KC: @MrGattz I totally understand, I can't imagine the amount of mining they do to track the data... but it seems that their blanket fixes never satisfy (even tho they might help, lol)
[0:14:51] N3llee: SAME
[0:14:51] PidiaP: No Necrolord changes towGreen
[0:14:54] idenkaz_: KEKW same
[0:14:56] Thoreya: lolol
[0:14:56] Nazkol: its 20% on him
[0:15:02] N3llee: Including my weekly ash mission
[0:15:03] Thoreya: they said reset no?
[0:15:16] duhworks: arms needs way more than 3% buff
[0:15:36] theDirtyon3: KEKW no
[0:15:39] CatsRusOfficial: Arms doesn’t need more, fury is the spec that needs seeing too
[0:16:01] Syllvn: I cleared layer 8 around that
[0:16:11] JukasZor: wait, soul ash is now account wide or the layer 8 unlock is account wide?
[0:16:19] mo197: Lulu streaming too.....nice
[0:16:19] idenkaz_: just the layer
[0:16:22] Darthyrevan: arms for for pve not pvp
[0:16:25] CatsRusOfficial: Unlock is account wide now
[0:16:33] MrGattz: @Twigz_KC i would much rather see like a full 5 pages of "this ability was buffed by 3% from x to x" than a blanket "all damage abilities buffed by 3%" because at least the 5 pages shows effort even if none was given.
[0:16:47] Thoreya: @Towelliee dude EU had a prot pally as a healer make top 4 in AWC today lol
[0:16:49] Thoreya: Drainer

[0:18:38] theDirtyon3: nerf WoG and buff armor again
[0:18:58] zemnii_: word of glory = lay on hands most of the time. its obsurd
[0:19:35] CatsRusOfficial: They should just scale it to max health of the player. To like 25% heal
[0:19:39] trailerparkholly: What’s a carry for that vicious war spider run these days?
[0:20:06] trailerparkholly: Ballpark
[0:20:27] CatsRusOfficial: 2-3 million more

[0:22:00] nagi_777x: hi Towel
[0:22:06] CatsRusOfficial: Yeah it just needs to go to max health scaling. That would solve so that it can stay viable in both PvP and pve

[0:37:15] hgizaira: 3% is like 200 dps for my enh shaman so it's good
[0:37:39] DrRockso85: my boy Dug!
[0:37:50] Tigerklaue: they buffed even the good follower

[0:38:32] Fenixzzz: !uptime
[0:38:33] Tigerklaue: night fae could finish any mission without problems until now
[0:38:39] LJimbox: making games is harder than playing them
[0:38:45] fuzzbucket: i thought Venthyr companions were pretty decent, but Kyrian definitely needed a buff
[0:38:50] Daggerstry: They wanted people to complete the campaign before they started crying
[0:38:56] mo197: fixed it now that you have a night fae
[0:39:50] Ablackdruid: I was watching your stream one day and you spent like 10 minutes trying to beat a mission and you just couldnt win with any comp. I thought it was really funny
[0:39:53] binr_: 3% on warrior that makes me happy.

[0:42:05] Daggerstry: I mean, I did my hunter as Kyrian, Warrior as Venthyr, and have yet to decide DH

[0:43:49] Lantern214: @Towelliee Vent is better when you break 20+ keys, b/c the pridful hits really hard, so your ashen hallow healing helps the healer

[4:53:34] Tru1485: I mean NF was broken & I agree with nerfing them but the missions already out shouldn't have been affected
[4:53:51] MysticalOS: like i literally refused to unlock layers on alts. so now i'll do torghast on alts finally
[4:53:56] cowboy0010: you should lol
[4:53:58] iBarb: hey peeps what is this addon?
[4:54:01] iBarb: please?
[4:54:04] ZeethianDragon: Meatball destroys
[4:54:05] iBarb: lol
[4:54:16] TheGiant99: whjat addon is this for the table
[4:54:18] ContraRob: Which table addons are you using? Venture plan and?
[4:54:19] JukasZor: venture plan
[4:54:25] cowboy0010: venture plan
[4:54:27] RyanSMcCann: I just grind the XP missions to bring everyone up
[4:54:39] MysticalOS: throw a troop in and check book, might be doable with tank and healer there
[4:54:49] JukasZor: venture plan last updated 3 days ago
[4:54:50] Rygothx: Likely
[4:55:02] cowboy0010: @Towelliee just put someone in and click the book.. it'll tell you the likely outcome
[4:55:09] ZeethianDragon: only way you were able to beat this soul ash mission was with strong ranged dps
[4:55:09] Lazugo: Some mod give me permission to post link pls
[4:55:21] Lazugo: I have the supreme table addon
[4:55:23] TheCliffyShow: I finally got a adventure campaign quest done. So, they must have buffed something. Because before I couldn't get anything other then the basic ones done.
[4:55:28] iBarb: it is not showing up in curse forge
[4:55:47] magemaster225: addon covenant mission helper optimizes your group so you dont have to worry about which order to put them in, can use on top of venture plan
[4:55:49] showmethesugar35: Towlliee with no glasses...must be his twin brother
[4:55:53] Anguyen92ab: Uh Oh...
[4:55:57] cowboy0010: right
[4:55:57] MysticalOS: if the addon is smart it scans tooltips, so it'll have new values
[4:55:57] Lazugo: lazugo subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 10 months! 
[4:56:07] ContraRob: You don't think it reads live values?
[4:56:09] cowboy0010: it don't take into account alot of the abilities either
[4:56:15] noobreignz: what happens when you fail?
[4:56:18] CDubTheRIPper: draven is a big help once you get him up to level
[4:56:23] Lazugo: https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/covenantmissionhelper have mr towellie
[4:56:26] cowboy0010: you get xp and that's it
[4:56:54] darth3232: what addon are you using for that mission table
[4:57:01] cowboy0010: @Towelliee what troops you have and what they do?
[4:57:18] Zarinna2015: What add on for the mission table?
[4:57:32] Lexi__Marie: i logged into my nightfae and the tooltip says bramble trap has a 1 round cooldown.. which was part of the changes today right
[4:57:36] CDubTheRIPper: Venture plan
[4:57:39] darth3232: why does your mission table look so diffrent from mine
[4:57:48] cowboy0010: @Zarinna2015 Venture Plan
[4:57:54] willyum668: Venture plan
