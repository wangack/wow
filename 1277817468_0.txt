[8:32:57] ironforge_1337: if they're rank 5 and they bracket break and get #1, is there a benefit for them longterm?
[8:32:58] thepaddyo: No idea why they didnt add TBC token system for classic pvp gear in SoM
[8:33:07] basquino: *this
[8:33:26] aviduser2: see how much honor u gain in AV
[8:33:42] raminku: swifty, do you have any tips for someone who just started playing tbc and wants to catch up? I have a lvl 15 nelf druid and lvling seems sooo slow
[8:33:52] aviduser2: dont you have enough for gloves if you do 1 turnin now?
[8:33:57] Lonnert: maybe play the som character that you just grinded for, i wouldnt want to grind in tbc again now after your journey
[8:33:59] sannare: why frustrated
[8:34:19] aviduser2: but you also gain 1 token that is worth 157 honor. @Swifty
[8:34:31] aviduser2: that the addon ignores
[8:34:36] angrypoopoo1: Loss on AV is around 150 right now
[8:34:38] bobsleftshoe: mark turn in gives 650 honor
[8:34:40] ironforge_1337: you get paid for it lol
[8:34:42] thepaddyo: lol thats about same as getting exalted in WSG
[8:34:42] philmcrakennn: You know, you actually dont HAVE too?
[8:34:43] avenomxx: season 1 isnt that bad
[8:34:45] angrypoopoo1: Win is around 350-400 honor
[8:34:45] bobsleftshoe: instead of 315
[8:34:48] sannare: yeah ok
[8:34:49] philmcrakennn: you could go spend time with the GF instead?
[8:34:53] Lonnert: get the t4 tokens for s1 gear, they just updated it
[8:35:00] basquino: aw, man. This is the expansion which is making me think of resubbing and buying a 60 boost. To play Dranei shammy on Pagle server. Not worth it?
[8:35:10] unemployed_degenerate: dont forget bg weekends and daily which is 1k honor now as well as spirit tower daily
[8:35:10] aviduser2: @Swifty you have to add the token value that is +157 honor
[8:35:15] ironforge_1337: @philmcrakennn terrible idea
[8:35:29] philmcrakennn: @ironforge_1337 Fair
[8:35:40] angrypoopoo1: AV is super super fast right now, win is like 300-400

[8:36:05] aviduser2: you HAVE to account for each token = 157 honor
[8:36:06] Lonnert: ab weekend atm too
[8:36:08] CoIdwarr: I tought they put tokens on raid boss to get pvp gear
[8:36:08] Animatron: 60k / ((Honor for win + Honor for loss) / 2)
[8:36:14] unemployed_degenerate: pug ssc or kara tokens can be turned in for s1 / s2 gear
[8:36:15] Lonnert: and trading in marks are 600 each now
[8:36:17] Footylol: ya math is way off. think of daily bg win. and mark turnins

[8:36:58] Footylol: exactly. tokens will speed it up. gear doesnt require tokens. spend it on honor quicker
[8:37:00] aviduser2: lose 1 of each BG = +620 BONUS honor
[8:37:02] Lonnert: so dont get mad about someting unrealistic
[8:37:03] fictionless33: it was wayyyyy worse before todays patch
[8:37:05] fictionless33: way worse

[8:37:48] StreamElements: Redeem Points at point store https://streamelements.com/swifty/store
[8:37:56] aviduser2: also you get like 1k honor from daily + 450 worth of marks
[8:37:57] Lonnert: handing in marks gives the best honor , so you should always try to trade that quest in
[8:38:16] Doublecheese85: Swifty did u alrdy made ur parade through og as a rank 14?
[8:38:20] angrypoopoo1: im in AV right now, lets see how long it is. going super super fast , its just zerg zerg zerg
[8:38:31] aviduser2: you will not lose 300 games
[8:38:38] Lonnert: but you gain a mark for a loss too. so every 4 losses extra 600 honor
[8:38:42] mangoessgreen: terrokar spirit tower quest is a 1k honor daily too
[8:38:43] TreeTopAnonymous: just run kara and trade tier badges

[8:40:36] fictionless33: its tbc man.. you arent supposed to be able to get geared over night
[8:40:38] aviduser2: thats is like hitting the jackpot 20 times in a row.
