[0:25:16] vulkankragon: is dragonflight the last expansion?
[0:26:18] Aervyper: i can't imagine it
[0:26:32] PotbellyGoat: they are working on the next expansion...now lol
[0:26:32] Aervyper: if Shadowlands didn't kill wow how can dragonflight
[0:26:46] PotbellyGoat: they always work on the next after releasing one
[0:28:17] Molvonos: What a weird question to start off with.
[0:28:31] Molvonos: Everquest is still making expansions, Runescape is still going strong
[0:28:37] Molvonos: But Dragonflight's the last WoW expansion?
[0:29:15] vulkankragon: so its safe to assume that wow 2 will never be developed as long as they keep releasing expansions?
[0:29:33] Thoreya: shout to BDGG being 7/8
[0:30:46] Molvonos: No other MMO has made a '2' except for Everquest, and that was due to 'time shenanigans' that they thought made sense. (hint: it still doesnt make sense and split the fanbase, rendering both games into the meh shadows of what they were).
[0:30:56] PotbellyGoat: Overwatch 2 taught them don't make a 2nd of a main franchise
[0:31:07] Molvonos: OW2 was a cashgrab and little else.
[0:31:28] trione288: ow2 coukld've been more
[0:31:38] vulkankragon: there is guild wars 2
[0:31:40] Thoreya: rs3 was a new version of osrs
[0:31:42] Thoreya: wasnt as popular tho

[0:33:16] Molvonos: @Molvonos I utterly forgot about GW2 to be honest, I'll admit my mistakes.  It's a completely different game and GW more or less ceased being when GW2 came out though.
[0:33:21] vulkankragon: wow 2 on unreal engine 5 would make sense
[0:33:29] Aervyper: @Molvonos was a bit more to that EQ 2 had a 4 day dead servers a month into launch against wow right before christmas. It crippled the game so bad everyone just went to wow because all the hype
[0:33:37] instant_savage: guild wars 2 is probaly the only succesful one

[2:05:36] mozavich: @Nim128 i think towelliee is smart enough to realize growing/failing trends. nobody will know if streaming will be lucrative forever. your comment is cringe because it's true with any job, yet you chose to comment here.
[2:05:38] StreamElements: Use code POGTOWEL120 for $120 off at https://strms.net/TowellieeFactorMarBot #ad
[2:05:44] Delts5: I think gaming it the largest growing too

[2:07:00] HaloS23: Twitch > Hollywood
[2:07:01] mozavich: oh wait lol
[2:07:02] Mecabeast: streaming will put talk shows and network television out of business within next 100yrs I think

[2:07:09] Skylin3r: RIP Cam

[2:07:26] cyrex172: yeah but listen tow, its very hard for fresh people to create a channel like yours the field is too saturated
[2:07:27] TwynSun: TwynSun subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 8 months! 
[2:07:38] SlideCancelXDD: Got our AOTC last night, pretty stoked

[2:09:40] TheCJrose1234: I feel like getting found if you're trying to do variety is impossible. Gotta stick with one game to get the base first
[2:09:42] HaloS23: lord knows we could use a new Robin Williams
[2:09:44] UnoBoxo: Well you have to find what's most popular at the time. Like right now it's short form media on tik tok and stuff. You just have to follow trends and point the people to where you want them to be.
[2:09:51] Nim128: Become a stream manager for youngsters....for a "small" percentage hehehe
[2:09:56] Grunton: tiktok is the way to be found
[2:10:01] cyrex172: nah tow its not just that ur old,, u still bring it because u love us

[2:12:36] xALcaPWNedx: This week is just transmog week lol
[2:12:41] kimmo_gaming: @Towelliee Sloot did a 20 AV, and they were there for an hour, last boss is like 10 minutes LOL
[2:12:43] LoremasterMarthan: This is the week I have decided to work on PvP gearing because dungeons are just abysmal

[2:13:38] rosina_scarlett: true
[2:13:54] cyrex172: Bdgg would be an awesome guild to join
[2:13:57] rosina_scarlett: idk what they ran on brood
[2:14:31] SlideCancelXDD: a 20 is harder than mythic raiding in terms of the first few bosses right now
[2:14:32] firewalltwitch: 15 M+ is harder then every heroic boss but the last, and even still lol
[2:14:48] firewalltwitch: 20 M+ is harder then mythic raiding bosses too
[2:14:58] REALPolarbeezy: RLP isnt as bad as it was, just the 2nd one is cheeks.
[2:15:00] SlideCancelXDD: yep
[2:15:03] cyrex172: @z3roeloh3ro  glad ur here wioth us man
[2:15:04] mavericks312: idk i think aside from raz's shield the raid is tuned fine
[2:15:13] SeckSymbols: The only way a kill happens today is if P3 is severely undertuned
[2:15:16] CriticalPhil: i dont see them killing it without nerfs
[2:15:38] Davedaman26: @Towelliee where do you go to get cards graded? Since I opened my Panini Score 2022 NFL cards and I got a Kaleb Eleby rookie card that is shinny according to the Panini box its a Rookies Gold with some electric background.

[4:06:27] Dcarter: For no reason
[4:06:43] yodabest5752: I feel like there has to be a middle ground for Blizz in this
[4:07:04] rillo5: I saw your tweet, so they don’t test public anymore for the last boss?

[4:07:31] flebbooo: KEKW
[4:07:32] FreeguyDH: Bandage
[4:07:32] snake_like: blizzard thinking tuning is a failure if a guild putting hundreds of thousands of dollars into it beats it in a few days. SMFH. just let people play the game
[4:07:36] drewetling: heart of azzeroth
[4:07:36] gelimarr: not always
[4:07:39] Irhamel: try to bandage her
[4:07:40] rillo5: Nope they changed it I remember

[4:08:09] rillo5: The back door used to be shut behind her I believe
[4:08:11] givmeafrekinname: you can use heart of azeroth on her if you have it
[4:08:16] aleck1776: KEKW
[4:08:28] yodabest5752: Yea, but id rather see RWF where they have to face more hard bosses then just the last one taking a week
[4:08:55] cyrex172: @yodabest5752 aghreed!
[4:09:12] gelimarr: you are 8 am
[4:09:50] cyrex172: this and the latest class balance patches show blizzard is really bad at tuning and balancing these days
[4:09:56] kellar001: agreed
[4:10:07] snake_like: my man who cares if it gets cleared in an hour
[4:10:11] Keglett: Where does Halondrus rank in wow raid history
[4:10:19] Tarastus: i believe you can mount up and sell here
[4:10:19] instant_savage: all in all its fine that the boss is this way, and the make the guilds work for it, just shoukdnt be happening 2 days b4 christmas

[4:10:36] DavisFacts: so do they not get to play the raid before it releases? even in beta?
[4:10:41] stepdrag: LMAO goat cheese balls
[4:10:41] r3muz: ew
[4:10:44] anizzaofdoomhammer: Just ruined goat cheese for me...:(
[4:10:48] Rudric_Ice: NO HOME FOR U
[4:10:49] GodTheMechanic: For free goat cheese though...
[4:10:50] RENDH: Goat cheese smelling balls does not sound right at all lmao
[4:10:52] Holysal: im already losing interest tbh
[4:10:53] Celestia6: especially with christmas in a few days
[4:10:54] agg_ie: so they cant raid from home?
[4:11:00] Dcarter: They think it’s hard when it’s not the difficulty it’s simply tuning
[4:11:06] gelimarr: I have thos core memory of you: You were drinking couple years ago around 8am. Some dude said "it's 8 am" on which you responded with : "You are 8 am" and it cracked me up
[4:11:07] cyrex172: who doesnt like a good ball of goat cheese?
[4:11:19] Lorilath: think you can mount there

[4:11:32] grimreapermn: you can mount up there and sell
[4:11:36] Codeblue2023: to be honest we want them getting done quickly and still love the game if it went on for months they would hate wow
[4:11:38] Irhamel: @Towelliee not only that, as an organization (business for that matter), the longer the race lasts, the worse of a "business" it is for them
[4:11:41] deadxarrival: why not sell stuf on mount
[4:11:44] Collateral_Energy: couldve sold on your mount xD
[4:11:46] Alsparq: which wings do you have left?
[4:11:52] Aidler: lol there can be a middle ground. of course viewers want a long race and raiders want it finished i 1 hour
[4:11:53] knox8992: use mamoth to sell
[4:12:06] Keglett: I thought wiping 600 times to mythic nzoth over a month was rough. Can't imagine doing that shit in a few days.
[4:12:08] Reklusion: Normal you can
[4:12:10] heavens_nightmare: honestly with the race after the first couple days I really start losing like all interest in it
[4:12:11] Frenaris: you do for heroic versions
[4:12:19] Reklusion: For the heroic/sanc gear you need the last piece
[4:12:25] cyrex172: @alsparq is your name a transformers reference bro?
[4:12:27] rillo5: That’s for regular then you upgrade with the token
[4:12:31] JasperXIII: Man I cant get a weapon for the life of me from M+

[4:15:16] kostchie: yes and you need the token
[4:15:22] rillo5: You basically turn them in to upgrade
[4:15:23] Lexi__Marie: you buy the base, then you use the normal tokens, then you use the heroic tokens
[4:15:24] Sollice: @Lulaboo busy busy
[4:15:25] Mecabeast: base gear for gold, normal gear for base and token, then heroic is normal gear + heroic token
[4:15:29] Reklusion: Normal -> Sanc + normal item -> sanc + heroic token for a full item upgrade
[4:15:51] cabalish: put it on then sell
[4:16:09] twowheelsonelife: Looted a elemental lariat design yesterday passing through an elemental storms area to kill captain lancer... sold for 2.1 million gold

[4:19:59] Kyle_Glide: just dont sleep EZ LUL
[4:20:04] ColdChillXI: Staaph

[4:20:14] dutchie76: man 47% vs 43% of echo
[4:20:23] Gruffian: Nerf it when Liquid goes to bed, before Echo starts. They both had the previous day, that's fair.
[4:20:24] vision42g: man this week m+ rough
[4:20:30] shmasherd: shmasherd subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 39 months! 
[4:20:33] rockhell12: Lock em both out until Wednesday lol
[4:20:36] snake_like: pro tip: stop tuning it for e-sports orgs
[4:20:41] degonite29: R2WF is boring its always a unkillable boss or takes way to long from a viewer stand point
[4:20:44] ColdChillXI: make a non nerfed server for them LUL
[4:20:49] agg_ie: Then they wait another week?
[4:20:50] Sollice: HOLIDAY THE FUCK YOU SAY
[4:20:51] Dragunstorm15: well for liquid too they can watch phase 3 which echo has been in twice now
[4:21:06] terikar: surely they just state that they are dropping a tuning patch on X date and X time and it's up to the guilds to be online and rested?
[4:21:07] DeanoTV: dance off :(
[4:21:10] Sevcikova: Set working hours? for all teams?
[4:21:11] HaxzorJimDuggan: towBolvar
[4:21:14] Aidler: christmas is overrated KappaClaus
[4:21:17] Keglett: Don't wanna see arthas getting dropped into the Maw Kappa
[4:21:23] cyrex172: that bow is sick
[4:21:27] r3muz: it's the blue lich king, the one before the red one
[4:21:30] CrunkyBrewster: Imagine you're at the dinner table with your family on Christmas, and you get a call to go into Blizz and nerf a boss
[4:22:10] dutchie76: what do you think of the Roadmap?
[4:22:10] darthvapor420: i think a sit down with blizz heads and rwf would a least help them hear grievences no? maybe find a solution or two?
[4:22:11] Aidler: I’m sure the family will understand naguuraGiggle
[4:22:14] SeckSymbols: @snake_like Its not tuned for e-sports orgs, they specifically stated they didnt want another jailer situation and the fight just seems to be overtuned
[4:22:16] dutchie76: pretty cool
[4:22:30] CrunkyBrewster: yeah exactly
[4:23:15] zysmos: question is why do they release the new expansion and the classic raids at midnight europe
[4:23:24] zysmos: but not the raid for retail
[4:23:30] mavericks312: i put some of it on the raiders as well like yall new this could have been a possibilty
[4:23:37] kokochris: and they should take vacation; they need downtime too
[4:23:40] GameWithDerp: only thing that cannot be done remotely would be actual hardware failure
[4:23:47] Rudric_Ice: they could have opened mthic on the first week of jan

[4:23:52] N3llee: Perfect example is the D4 team.. aint no one in the office right now untiol after the 1st then its hardcore crunch time
[4:23:54] Aquadriel: is easier for 40 people to organize themselves for a  fair race than asking blizzard to make an extra effort for those 40 @Towelliee
[4:23:57] GameWithDerp: everythign from dev/deployments/hotfixes can be done remotely
[4:24:05] Kinghorn: maybe dont release at christmas time cobaltHMM
[4:24:05] zuluhawk: Be funny if some random guild has already beaten Mythic and didnt stream it at all
[4:24:08] cyrex172: thats the nature of mmorpgs tho,
[4:24:34] Kinghorn: diggy diggy hole
[4:24:35] UnoBoxo: They definitely do
[4:24:39] LoremasterMarthan: Overtime pay to cater to players would be quite the rule set LU
[4:24:40] LoremasterMarthan: LUL
[4:24:41] kokochris: doubtful, but they will get an add to their bonus most likely.
[4:24:46] Syllvn: @GameWithDerp That's still working... xD
[4:24:53] Remeork: @zuluhawk Don't stream and don't use anything related to raider.io That would be hilarious
[4:24:57] issoebom: hi hi Towellie!!! FootGoal
[4:24:59] GameWithDerp: definately don't, but big bonuses and stock
[4:25:03] Gruffian: Would people have been too bored if they just held Mythic raid release til after the New Year?
[4:25:07] Aidler: the race will be decided by a coin flip. a blizz GM will do it
[4:25:12] dutchie76: yea that shield nerf last night was insane
[4:25:13] GameWithDerp: @GameWithDerp I don't disagree, that was more a comment of them 'going in' anywhere
[4:25:21] cabalish: a bird ruins xmas
[4:25:24] Rudric_Ice: they could have opened mythic on the first week of jan everyone would've been happy
[4:25:28] knox8992: why do they need to do anything at all? just leave it
[4:25:30] GameWithDerp: Oh wow, threads are weird
[4:25:39] UnoBoxo: From a corporate perspective there is always someone looking
[4:25:42] cyrex172: even with the knobs turned down the average guild will take months to clear this if ever
[4:25:50] Syllvn: @GameWithDerp I saw it, dw man :)
[4:25:52] dutchie76: there going to nerf the boss again imo
[4:26:02] GothmaN: anyone has the name of the site towel look at earlier for the crafting ?
[4:26:12] krayaal: maybe its just Ian sitting on couch at home with a mobile app they made to change settings
[4:26:14] Keglett: grizzly hills Kreygasm
[4:26:25] dutchie76: suspect
[4:26:28] dutchie76: lol
[4:26:38] DeanieMan: @krayaal How I imagine it.
[4:26:38] dutchie76: it feels like jailer again lol
[4:26:43] darthvapor420: hire liquid and echo to raid test first?
[4:26:45] sgreth: Stop over tuning final bosses and let guilds race...instead of crawl a marathon and hope that the finish line gets moved for you...
[4:26:45] rLeo2: All I want for christmas is Fire to be buffed a little bit
[4:26:58] Aervyper: Why can't they just make RWF like the dungeon race? Gear is not variable and it's about the players
[4:26:59] cyrex172: ur dk looking sick
[4:26:59] Kinghorn: I cant wait until you get razzle to 1% and one of their siblings joins the fight
[4:27:04] Kinghorn: anduin was nerfed SO MUCH
[4:27:12] cyrex172: i made my dk orc too
[4:27:13] Kinghorn: probably most nerfed boss ever
[4:27:15] LB_MadMonk: This race is crazy @Towelliee

[4:27:40] Skylin3r: hmm
[4:27:45] Sevcikova: A lot of people work Xmas, first responders for one, hospitals and staff, heck even my brother has to go in christmas night for stocking at 11 pm.
[4:27:48] dutchie76: yea dks can solo bosses if the group dies
[4:27:53] MadCowScurge: I kinda feel like they need to change how the raids come out month by month starting with normal then a-just for heroic then mythic at the leas imo..
[4:28:03] Gingerprimer: @Kinghorn yeah only Liquid and Echo managed to kill Anduin on Heroic b4 the nerfsd
[4:28:04] LB_MadMonk: @cokezero1337 they have nerfed rasza 4 times already
