[2:29:41] JeffereyDonger: Shepi, where is the R btw haHAA
[2:29:44] FranciscoTheMage: !uptime
[2:29:55] GoEasyPPB: @AustralianFASTbowler optimisation is different to viability.
[2:29:59] Wikedlyrics: @restoratorrr the problem with VDH is that you have to lock in classes and most people don't use DK DPS so you will see mostly blood since you need the utility in certain dungeons
[2:30:03] Lastet: @FranciscoTHEmage 2H
[2:30:03] MystbornGames: Chinese pronunciation is sheRpi for the 2938473th time
[2:30:03] StareTV: its funny that dk was regarded as the worst tank at the beginning of the expansion
[2:30:05] grothak_: tank stop pulling everything BabyRage
[2:30:07] yoppa74: @restoratorrr not really, DH is only good for pushing high keys, rather than speedrunning lower ones, and you can easily counterpick a DH which is impossible for a DK
[2:30:11] Etny2k: Are those back to back eye beams from the legendary helm?

[2:30:37] AustralianFASTbowler: @BenHPriest you're very very wrong if you think anything BUT DK is optimal
[2:30:39] SeleneXIV: yeah @kaethsarden
[2:30:40] Hulknasty: @kaethsarden yes
[2:30:41] restoratorrr: @yoppa74 yeah that's a valid point.

[2:30:51] AstralLight911: Sometimes mods delete my messages and ban me because I’m telling the truth about the Illuminati.
[2:30:58] Etny2k: figures, never found that helm all legion
[2:30:59] Treckie: we've been live for 2hours @FranciscoTHEmage
[2:31:06] GoEasyPPB: @AustralianFASTbowler Thats why I said they're very different things. Also DH is better in some dungeons/comps

[2:32:59] mirandakeer: @Treckie is there a rules on how many players can change class with each dungeon ?
[2:33:04] Telomir: @Wikedlyrics yeah, I think locking classes was a knee-jerk reaction to time trials, where we saw multiclassing, converging towards a plethora of WW monks being played
