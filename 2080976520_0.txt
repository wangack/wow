[1:25:51] Sebleh: isn’t that your May already? Prague and Spain.
[1:25:55] Srosh_: I think it’s going to release within 4 weeks of gamescom ending (gamescom being end of August)
[1:26:07] Zirconn__: November is prime beach weather in florida, swing by and fight sebleh irl
[1:26:11] Paleee_: It's late summer on the roadmap and they haven't really gone off that so it's safe to assume it'll probably be late august
[1:26:41] Sparrowz: id say mid to late august just bc it anticipates on gamescom like srosh said
[1:26:58] Sparrowz: ya
[1:27:11] Sebleh: @zirconn__ please don’t involve me in her vacation shit.
[1:27:15] Sparrowz: just in terms of marketing things it could work out better
[1:27:41] Kuroz: they did for bfa
[1:27:47] Srosh_: don’t think so either but it’s march already and beta has been six months in the past, no?
[1:27:48] Zirconn__: naguuraSip
[1:27:53] Sparrowz: ok fair point but it would also line up with other releases

[1:29:11] Draznath: wasn't legion announced at gamescon? or was that something else
[1:29:17] Reloe: yep that was legion
[1:29:27] Sparrowz: because they're seemingly really trying to be making the players feel listenned to. which so far imo theyve done well as

[1:30:48] Sparrowz: for marketing
[1:30:56] Sparrowz: maybe i was expressing myself wrong earlier
[1:31:08] laggy_cs: not sure it will be ready in time

[1:46:50] stev391: so you think s4 will be shorter?
[1:46:52] Sparrowz: like they dont want any leaks because they want to have a "complete" thing to show ppl
[1:46:55] Sparrowz: and get ppl hooked
[1:46:57] captainpetson: when we get the infos for the s4 tho? thats the real question

[1:48:45] enchantedtent: why dont u add the 2 auth to unlock the free 4 slot in your bag
[1:49:47] rouqle: looks like lots of people are doing 20+
[1:49:53] rouqle: m+ is okay I guess
[1:50:10] big_hero_d: M+ in season 3 is by far the easiest of all time
[1:50:11] Elembry_us: People are getting burned out on S2. Hope it's earlier than that
[1:50:31] big_hero_d: no sesional affix

[1:51:37] Allonas: M+ Scaling this season is whack, i want them to increase HP of the mobs more and less damage growth to stop just one shot walls
[1:51:37] Sebleh: well yes lower keys are a lot easier.
[1:51:42] captainpetson: 20 feel easier or players got better
[1:52:01] Allonas: Its more fun to face a DPS check then a oneshot check
[1:52:06] xenrelay: it is because of power creep

[1:52:22] Sebleh: naguura you have to realize when someone in chat comes and says “m+ is easier this season” it doesn’t mean “the keys you do are so easy now” it’s relative to the majority of the playerbase that caps on +20.

[1:53:02] JohnAllenCasts: Oh is this the loot discussion?
[1:53:05] censiGFY: Aug was so broken last season it was +3key level for free just by existing KEKW
[1:53:07] censiGFY: Allo here
[1:53:10] hiimcusz: OMG someone else is doing content that is easier than mine and getting gear!
[1:53:14] aaron_joseph_93: Hey, Nag. Have you played much WoW SoD?
[1:53:19] captainpetson: I remember sl s1 a 17-18 was a kinda difficult key
[1:53:20] Kuroz: she didn't
[1:53:36] JohnAllenCasts: Seen some kinda outta touch takes on loot from M+
[1:53:41] Sebleh: @censigfy it’s another +3 this season because they put an extra 13 ilvls for no reason.
[1:53:46] big_hero_d: @captainpetson  better to forgot about SL aSAP xD
[1:54:38] Nicstar1007: Is your mic on the table?
[1:54:40] TotallyNotRaien: chill in a +29 rise
[1:54:45] censiGFY: Sebleh what you re saying doesnt make sens cuz you dont take in account the dungeon scaling
[1:54:54] Nicstar1007: ah ok
[1:54:56] shameshady: did you see the AWC this weekend ? @Naguura
[1:55:04] Sparrowz: @Sebleh i think they didnt do it for no reason, just that we wont have much item level increase for the fated season incoming

[1:56:14] big_hero_d: just take 1 shaman with poison totem :D
[1:56:18] yenny__: @censiGFY people are also waiting for the hidden .6 patch to see if it actually brings some new changes too
[1:56:24] big_hero_d: its 45 cd is enought to each aflicted
[1:56:27] yenny__: weve gonne pretty long with no news
[1:56:28] JohnAllenCasts: The most annoying thing about raging is when people DPS ads one at a time so you can't use AoE soothe effectively
[1:56:29] Sebleh: @censigfy they scaled M+ the same way they usually do (~4 key levels) and then on top of that they added 39 ilvls from mythic to mythic instead of the usual 26 (IE instead of new normal = previous mythic it’s now new LFR = previous mythic) so you have a lot more ilvls to carry you for lower keys.
[1:56:30] Allonas: What are those 200 cupcakes in your bags?
[1:56:53] Aegatron: emiruIME fak
[1:56:54] Sebleh: I gotta do a meeting thing. have fun with your bricks I mean keys bye chat stay cute feenUwu
[1:57:03] Kuroz: seblehPhone
[1:57:06] sim967: @allonas it’s how to be a tuskaar
[1:57:20] censiGFY: Sebleh yea but also gotta take in account the profile of keys. They re just about oneshots so, lower level, dmg are not a deal cuz you just survive
[1:57:38] AceReformed: When is the pirate patch even? HmmmOK
[1:57:39] censiGFY: Pirate patch i hope they ll buff outlaw, we need it for real for real

[2:40:04] Thevio: is this live?
[2:40:31] beautymustdie1: no
[2:40:50] Skaranox: @Thevio no, games was yesterday
[2:40:54] Thevio: ok
[2:40:56] Thevio: who won lol
[2:41:08] Skaranox: @Thevio spoiler alert ? XD
[2:41:12] oTOKEo: @Thevio you got google....
[2:41:15] fullmetal030: use google
[2:41:45] Vendrek: The semi-finals nagrand map match was probably the best game
[2:41:55] imEcho: @Kuroz i dont think so all i have is dbm
[2:41:57] SenorTostada: PvP is real quick ye

[2:42:16] fullmetal030: Funny thing is pvp is not real quick right now...lol
[2:42:18] AceReformed: Mass root + beam
[2:42:18] Vendrek: yes
[2:42:30] Vendrek: mass entanglement not a pvp talent
[2:42:37] AceReformed: Its mass + beam
[2:42:39] Skaranox: @Vendrek semi-final dalaran maps was craaaazy but yeah, all the liquid/echo's games were mad
[2:43:00] AceReformed: Lontar gets cheaps
[2:43:05] Vendrek: @Skaranox true...yesterdays games in general were good
[2:43:10] Boruox: Sam knocked him out of the link
[2:43:16] AceReformed: Typhoon to knock lontar
[2:43:21] AceReformed: out of the spirit link
[2:43:31] AceReformed: Thtas why the link misses
[2:43:41] Skaranox: @Vendrek agree 200% ^^
[2:43:51] MBG_95: in that situation the link was only a 10% DR tho right
[2:43:54] fullmetal030: its a nice setup cross cc with beam
[2:44:12] MBG_95: @AceReformed oh didnt see it was on him
[2:45:00] fullmetal030: Sam is so crazy
[2:45:09] Vendrek: @Skaranox Still want to see some balance changes on DH and Comabt rogue...nothing drastic but changes to GCD list for combat and defensive changes for DH.
[2:45:21] Vendrek: just for pvp
[2:45:34] Vendrek: well maybe not just for pvp
[2:45:50] Ralynx: chan is on raiku at that point, should link on them two, not himself
[2:45:56] Skaranox: @Vendrek yeah, DH is a little too op. The burst is insane and too much defense :)
[2:46:07] Ralynx: but tbh lontar prob missclicked the ground from typhoon
[2:46:21] moltencrucible: is this the grand finals or the first series in the upper finals?
[2:46:36] fullmetal030: yeah no trinket for the kidney there is real bad

[2:47:07] Owendgg: Hello Naguura hope you're doing good <3
[2:47:41] Vendrek: @Skaranox They have the most defensives and some of the most powerful...same goes for their CC.
[2:48:10] Vendrek: Shoots lazers at casters casting
[2:48:25] Vendrek: not affliction
[2:48:26] Hippwn: it shoots a really strong attack

[2:48:41] Vendrek: casting in general...think it is finish so even insta casts
[2:48:54] MBG_95: @Vendrek the most defensives? its blur + netherwalk
[2:48:55] Skaranox: @moltencrucible this is still serie
[2:48:58] Ralynx: static field totem
[2:48:58] Vendrek: static totem
[2:49:07] Ralynx: and sham can move it so he drags them with
[2:49:18] preffan: pulls in
[2:49:21] fullmetal030: u can totemic projection it
[2:49:22] Ralynx: totem in middle, anyone inside cannot leave that outer ring
[2:49:22] AceReformed: static totem yeh, shaman can relocate it and takes you with it
[2:49:24] okcoolstory: drag it
[2:49:25] fullmetal030: and it pulls you away
[2:49:25] Hippwn: if they try to leave static field it pulls them back in
[2:49:32] Vendrek: @MBG_95 Blur Netherwalk Glimpse Darkness...
[2:49:55] Vendrek: one of them is a group defensive
[2:50:06] Xillien: You have another talent that allows you to move your previous totem so you can place the static field totem on the enemies and then move it with totem projection
[2:50:26] cptdrage: using the infinte hand weap from dawn of infinite on one of the arena to have the ekstra buff was pretty cool
[2:50:43] AceReformed: Observer is the warlock pet if you're curious, everytime someone casts when observer is up you get damaged
[2:50:58] fullmetal030: also precog is if you get kicked when u aren't casing you have interrupt, cc, and knock back immune for 4 seconds
[2:50:59] fullmetal030: real op
[2:51:18] AceReformed: Yeh precog is if you get kicked on no cast, you get cc immunity
[2:51:38] AceReformed: Yeh grounding and WS are hard counter
[2:51:53] Ralynx: root beam is deadly for them if the team dont react though
[2:51:53] AceReformed: it's that way for any hardcaster casters
[2:51:56] fullmetal030: Yeah shaman has always been the anti caster class

[2:52:26] Vendrek: link does not
[2:52:29] AceReformed: It was not this way before
[2:52:36] AceReformed: It does go through cyclone @Vendrek
[2:52:54] lilpepegatv: resto druid tranq goes into shadowduel as well
[2:52:55] Hyqo: link
[2:52:57] kaihole: it was link
[2:53:01] kaihole: the animation is slow
[2:53:02] AceReformed: It was link, link heals before it appears
[2:53:05] AceReformed: Animation is slower
[2:53:09] Foriix: netherwalk maybe
[2:53:33] Vendrek: what...don't think it is suppose...Clone is suppose to stop all healing and damage affects...there was a later game where when cloned it did not affect.
[2:53:53] AceReformed: @Vendrek Sharing health is technically not healing
[2:53:57] kaihole: ^
[2:54:16] Vendrek: hmmm...maybe the later game the link was killed before tick
[2:54:20] Ralynx: isnt that orbital strike or am i dumb
[2:54:22] maxmorey: Spectator bug
[2:54:26] AceReformed: I think it is just blizzard ui
[2:54:30] AceReformed: Because hes running incarn
[2:54:31] Ralynx: oh its the passive thing maybe
[2:54:38] Vendrek: Wwhat is what sorry?
[2:54:48] AceReformed: Nah I think it is CA but buggy
[2:54:50] MBG_95: @AceReformed it does show on logs as healing and damage taken btw
[2:54:51] AceReformed: Because Incarn replaces CA
[2:55:07] vodin__: Is this the grand finals or their first series?
[2:55:07] AceReformed: @MBG_95 Yes it does, but that is details
[2:55:14] Kuroz: first series
[2:55:19] vodin__: ooo nice
[2:55:36] MBG_95: @AceReformed details/logs is just reading what the combat log is doing, so it shouldnt really work
[2:55:39] Possitiviti: Is this series for who ggoes to finals?
[2:55:49] Kuroz: yes
[2:55:51] moltencrucible: @Possitiviti yes
[2:56:07] kaihole: Cdew is pumping

[2:58:43] moltencrucible: echo didn't drop a single game on eu servers i think...maybe one, but was kinda hard to play on na ping for them
[2:59:08] AceReformed: Is there no option for the sender to pay the vat? that is weird
[2:59:16] AceReformed: Like usually when I send stuff I pay it upfront for them
[2:59:39] playful_1: like an import tax?
[3:00:18] AceReformed: Import tax, and yeh if I send it to someone living outside of the netherlands i get notified they might have to pay more unless i pay it for them too HmmmOK
[3:00:49] ChaosRenown: legal extortion by the government
[3:00:50] MXicanTroll: I tend to have to pay VAT for most packages coming from Europe and i wont know until it reaches customs
[3:01:08] Kuroz: he didn't say
[3:01:30] warryvibe: Maybe 10 euro
[3:02:08] StreamElements: For Highlights, fun content and guides, remember to subscribe to my youtube channel -> https://www.youtube.com/naguura
[3:02:55] MXicanTroll: The time I asked is that my country has VAT for items that can be acquired locally, its meant to protect local merchants
[3:02:57] maxmorey: First is based on weight, then swaps every game
[3:03:03] ChaosRenown: they just have to deal with the ping
[3:03:10] maxmorey: rank* not weight
[3:03:33] warryvibe: 6 euro tax btw
[3:03:35] whitegarp: Hello, I am a beginner. Is it okay to skip a quest when you don't like it? For example, fishing.
[3:03:44] Rene_Torp: Here in Denmark we also have to pay a handling charge that is often higher than the tax there is being charged 🙈
[3:04:24] whitegarp: thank you
[3:04:28] portleys: Naguura, im an ele sham and i think I've hit my peak in LFG at the 27ish range of keys. Any tips on making myself more marketable on a bad spec in the community's eyes? >.<

[3:05:10] toastie_wow: @portleys reroll :)
[3:05:12] onedivine_: how does a classic Andy get into retail always liked it but when ever I try I get max level and don’t get how anything works!
[3:05:22] portleys: @toastie_wow i know =(((
[3:05:34] onedivine_: the game has changed so much
[3:06:26] fullmetal030: @portleys Same boat at 3400 on enhance. I stopped trying at this point 2 hours to get into a single key just isn't fun.
[3:06:28] ChaosRenown: @onedivine_ gotta do some research or watch youtube, no other way
[3:06:42] AceReformed: Yeh watch guides, heard youtube/naguura had some pretty good ones Kapp
[3:07:11] yungturbo__: watching guides and banging on a target dummy for a few hours and you're right back into it
[3:07:14] AceReformed: 10.2
[3:07:17] Kuroz: 2.5
[3:07:21] PappGS: 10.2.5
[3:07:21] warryvibe: Shruge
[3:07:22] trollinmyimp: 10.2.5
[3:07:45] onedivine_: like do servers matter anymore? do people still raid in guilds
[3:07:48] fennrirq: @onedivine_ try playing Path of Exile, then you will figure out WoW in 1 hour
[3:08:31] AceReformed: PoE is not that hard bro, only took me about 8k hours to understand 80% of the game KEKLEO

[3:09:26] yungturbo__: Trill honestly hits those burst windows like it's a mortal kombat combo
[3:09:30] yungturbo__: he's so fast
[3:09:41] AceReformed: Nah
[3:09:45] AceReformed: Under pressure no
[3:09:54] warryvibe: @fennrirq I'm 61.6 hours in, I don't understand shit
[3:10:14] AceReformed: @fennrirq Sorry my other 31k hours went into wow
[3:10:32] fennrirq: @AceReformed respect cypherBoss
[3:10:54] fennrirq: @warryvibe try Last Epoch it's way more casual and straightforward
[3:10:57] 1nightplays: naguura would u ever pvp competitively?
[3:11:00] AceReformed: And then final 10k hours probably went into league of legends Despairge
[3:11:13] warryvibe: @fennrirq I am playing LE too KEKW

[3:12:14] AceReformed: Cdew contributing more then sam KEKW
[3:12:32] AceReformed: Sad that balance druids in 3s / shuffle are mostly a starsurge and beam bot
[3:12:48] AceReformed: Cyclone/beam with a bit of starsurges
[3:13:06] dryangore: sam's fake casting is bis
[3:13:08] Bigpenance: this series was insane
[3:13:15] fullmetal030: Feel like Boomkins been that way for quite a while tho lol
[3:15:13] KelenusCR: Samiyam is such a beast, literally inspired to keep playing pvp moonkin
[3:15:51] fennrirq: how can I tell which player is on which team on the screen? Just color healthbars cmon NotLikeThis
[3:16:20] AceReformed: You can't KEKW @fennrirq
[3:16:38] AceReformed: Cdew got very greedy here
[3:16:40] KelenusCR: Next match is INSANE
[3:16:45] Bigpenance: ^^^^
[3:16:55] fennrirq: @Naguura how do i know it's not a buff?)
[3:17:24] countrycount: easy to distinguish the team...look at the floor..the one winning is not lying on it
[3:17:26] faulen: I wish I could have that circle in game.
[3:17:30] faulen: on my toon
[3:17:47] fennrirq: @Naguura I mean it's for casual viewers that would be not bad + there are class icons
[3:17:50] fullmetal030: big fake by chan
[3:17:57] fullmetal030: on that fear
[3:18:26] GuildChatter: They should have colored coded xmogs  =]
[3:18:29] faulen: eh, you look at the class once a match at the start.

[3:18:38] me_Bogdan: impossible to watch ur stream with that brightness coming off ur beauty
[3:19:16] Daikanatv: you can also just read names, not sure why the "casual viewer" can't do the bare minimum
[3:19:23] Bigpenance: this match is insane
[3:19:26] Vendrek: This matchup makes it easy because their is no same class
[3:19:27] Crucaider: Nameplates have the team color on the border
[3:19:28] Sothis_best_girl: I dunno, I feel like clear team info is really important? and class icons are pretty clear and visible?
[3:19:41] 1nightplays: blizzard chose the best layout
[3:19:44] fullmetal030: idk class colors are fine lol
[3:19:45] Vendrek: For mirror matches it is annoying
[3:19:45] Crucaider: The team color is on the nameplate
[3:19:45] GuildChatter: They should wear armor that's team colored
[3:19:48] 1nightplays: nobody knows what they talking about lol
[3:20:19] fennrirq: @Naguura I just really want to watch pvp as a pve player but I really cant understand anything  KEKHeim
[3:21:04] dryangore: I watch all the time, and pvp, and still sometimes can't follow... casters themselves sometimes get surprised by sudden kills and they are all great pvp players
[3:21:17] Vendrek: pretty much yes
[3:21:23] faulen: not when there are like 3 mirrior comps
[3:21:25] mappleyo: The border is also in team color
[3:21:30] fennrirq: @Naguura what if there are two same classes agianst
[3:21:37] Vendrek: What no it definitely is important to know class
[3:21:38] Sothis_best_girl: I mean, let's just say this: even th e casters got confused on who is on who's team because the team comp was mirrored as well
[3:21:39] Faithl3ssGaming: its really easy to see which team they are on due to colour at base of char
[3:21:57] Vendrek: ye
[3:22:00] faulen: like now you cannot see the circles on the ground
[3:22:02] jubbs: ive spent multiple seasons of WoW exclusively PvPing around 2400 rating and i have absolutely no clue whats going on when i watch
[3:22:05] 1nightplays: team comp is on the sides, shows u which 3 are together w names and bars on the sides
[3:22:08] StreamElements: For Highlights, fun content and guides, remember to subscribe to my youtube channel -> https://www.youtube.com/naguura
[3:22:11] Crucaider: The color is  also the border of the nameplates. It's super easy
[3:22:13] GuildChatter: yeah, this is just a mess when they're all piled on top of each other
[3:22:21] dnfbowser: u can see them but there is much else going on ^^
[3:23:05] fullmetal030: The game just isnt easy to understand period.
[3:23:14] khaste_G: i agree
[3:23:17] fullmetal030: you just need to play the game
[3:23:21] hiimcusz: As someone who played this game for 10 years but doesnt PVP, I have no clue wtf is going on
[3:23:21] fennrirq: @Naguura it's almost impossible to tel what is going on and I play wow for 10 years as a  a pve BibleThump
[3:23:39] 1nightplays: the commentators obviously have 0 problem understanding everything
[3:24:05] vodin__: Holy moly
[3:24:29] fullmetal030: The commentators are also multi rank 1 players tho lol
[3:24:29] warryvibe: @fennrirq Can't tell which class is which colour after 10 years? HUHH
[3:24:44] JamesOlogist: I watched pvp first time ever over the weekend; it was pixels bouncing everywhere and casters getting really excited. That's all I understood
[3:24:50] fennrirq: here's a 10 million cybersport idea for chat, so basically you create a gearing sandbox e.g. Last Epoch or PoE and then people can queue for Mythic dungeons, that would be a banger
[3:24:52] evrynameistkn: Still weird that cdew isnt the shaman
[3:24:54] Vendrek: This is the cross kill match...this one is great!
[3:25:13] fennrirq: @warryvibe do I really need to? I want to chill
[3:25:21] GuildChatter: omg.. this 3 minute ad break is gonna kill me
[3:25:31] GuildChatter: not now!
[3:25:39] Vendrek: haha
[3:25:42] fennrirq: @warryvibe you dont have players in football walking around in 20 different thirts
[3:25:46] countrycount: hm so far i have heard like 5 "HE IS GOING TO DIE" and no one died yet..sadge xD
[3:25:52] fullmetal030: This isn't football
[3:26:17] warryvibe: @fennrirq I don't watch football Shruge
[3:26:35] 1nightplays: to be fair i understand this more than a football match
[3:26:43] gamewatcher024: Good morning GlitchCat ImTyping SUBprise GalaxyUnpacked
[3:27:13] Vendrek: Football players in general are similar in function...yes they have specializations...Classes are a lot different from eachother than Football players are.
[3:27:48] fullmetal030: People like sports because they are easy to understand. WoW pvp just isnt.
[3:28:04] fennrirq: ok lets take league of legends worlds finals, one team blue healthbars second has red healthbars, how could someone argue if having 6 different colors is better POG
[3:28:13] GuildChatter: Ad break just ended.  Did I miss anything cool?  =P

[3:34:38] StreamElements: Join Naguura on her journey to become the most casual of transmog farmers!

Guidelines are posted in the #Nagothica channel of Naguura’s Discord. Date TBD. Check out the wish list for the event -> https://throne.com/naguura/collections/nagothika
[3:34:38] Kuroz: eiya is a host
[3:34:40] Vendrek: @arn_333 That was a Semi
[3:35:02] Kuroz: also asking to replace her when you're banned in her chat is slightly dumb, slightly
[3:35:10] arn_333: @Vendrek who are on final? when man?
[3:35:24] Vendrek: Final is over...it was Echo and Liquid again
[3:35:28] vodin__: It all finished yesterday if you want to go back and watch it arn

[3:35:56] MogyBear81: 4-1
[3:36:00] arn_333: who is that possible

[3:36:04] warryvibe: Liquid should've won
[3:36:05] hellsdrains: last game on Sewers aswel :P
[3:36:07] GuildChatter: This probably was the most memorable game ever though
[3:36:13] Vendrek: The final were good but not as good as this series
[3:36:14] warryvibe: That was insane plays by Trill
[3:36:19] Skaranox: yeah, they pretty much rekt Liquid. Semi-final was more intense :)
[3:36:23] RigelOrionis: they do the same thing to liquid in one of the final games
[3:36:24] forgottenmarsh: Echo rode the momentum in the lower bracket
[3:36:56] arn_333: that play deserve championship, no rematch needed
[3:37:00] GuildChatter: You can rest up
[3:37:13] Kuroz: great news
[3:37:17] Kuroz: hmmMeeting
[3:37:39] Eiya: HI YOU LOOK PRETTY TODAY

[3:39:01] zetheras42: @Eiya  hi Eiya!
[3:39:23] breaccglas123: Yes, she can't play it

[3:39:43] alanextv: let me carry you to glad @Naguura
[3:39:45] KelenusCR: that's valid :P
[3:39:54] Eiya: @zetheras42 hii
[3:40:11] AceReformed: eiyaDwagon Why hello miss @Eiya
[3:40:16] AceReformed: yes, I know
[3:40:17] AceReformed: KEKW
[3:40:23] Vendrek: I think you could do well...compete in AWC maybe not because that is a lot of commited time sink
[3:40:25] Eiya: naguura such a tryhard she cant comprehend just doing pvp for fun, she has to be competitive
[3:40:28] Kuroz: more like 5 of actual gameplay
[3:40:29] Eiya: NERD
[3:40:33] Kuroz: hmmMeeting
[3:40:38] AceReformed: It only took me 28k hours to get a r1 in pve and pvp YEP @Naguura Surely you can do that too
[3:40:41] fennrirq: @Eiya tell Blizzard to recolor health bars for each team so more people can understand what's going on, PvP seems fun KEKHeim
[3:41:04] Eiya: @fennrirq they have color coded borders on their nameplates and under their feet
[3:41:08] Hippwn: And 3 of those hours are waiting to get invited to a group lol
[3:41:33] fennrirq: @Eiya it's 5 minutes to change code logic
[3:41:49] Eiya: @fennrirq they are color coded tho
[3:41:51] AceReformed: Trust me guys ive been here for 8 and a half year, i've tried to get naguura into pvp so many times KEKLEO
[3:42:08] StreamElements: For Highlights, fun content and guides, remember to subscribe to my youtube channel -> https://www.youtube.com/naguura
[3:42:18] Eiya: and also it'd take way longer than 5 minutes - and people wanna see the class color
[3:42:45] fennrirq: @Naguura regular Andy doesnt even know what color is druid cmon
[3:42:48] Crucaider: Team color is ALREADY on the nameplate lawl
[3:42:52] AceReformed: Yeh people NEED to see class color, because if someone calls out shaman moves, you'd then need to look for who the shaman is
[3:42:53] Crucaider: It's the border
[3:42:56] AceReformed: I think team color is fine
[3:42:56] Eiya: I think a better alternative is color coded transmog
[3:43:00] bigbamboomie: i dont even play wow and i could tell who was on what team lol
[3:43:10] AceReformed: @Eiya Based
[3:43:12] fennrirq: @Naguura becasue I want MORE viewers for WOW BibleThump
[3:43:21] AceReformed: But bro AWC is not for casuals
[3:43:26] AceReformed: PvP in general is not for cauals in general
[3:43:29] AceReformed: It is super complex
[3:43:38] Eiya: @fennrirq by ruining the viewing experience of everyone else?
[3:43:38] AceReformed: I tell people who want to play PvP that they need atleast a few years
[3:43:40] ramfunky: Color xmog would be good
[3:44:14] MIGHTYMOUSE408: @acereformed a few years?? Lol. C'mon 😂
[3:44:19] nellkee: @Eiya I tought the same about transmog but I wonder how it would go if you had like a mage and a warlock with same race in the same team
[3:44:23] fennrirq: @Eiya "everyone else' which is 10K wont bring more money to wow and this game will be gone after riot mmo
[3:44:26] ramfunky: Yeah but if you want to grow you gotta cater to some casuals
[3:44:29] nellkee: well tbh, I'm not sure there is a perfect solution :D
[3:44:46] ZooNamiii: i know who every player is on each team ... for ME its easy to follow
[3:44:50] xenrelay: how about having a well informed opinion rather than just having an opinion.
[3:44:51] ItsExzi: i'm losing iq points listening to this convo
[3:44:58] warryvibe: @ItsExzi same
[3:45:12] AbieCherry: when i hear "riot mmo will kill wow" i just roll my eyes

[3:48:57] Eiya: With any luck, the riot mmo will just be another strong mmo in the space alongside ffxiv and wow and will only serve to make the mmo genre as a whole stronger
[3:48:59] y0rge: what was last mmo with tag wow killer ? new world ? :)
[3:49:13] SticksonTV: @Eiya this!!!
[3:49:14] Foggie: @SticksonTV Been doomsaying since before TBC launched lmao
[3:49:30] ramfunky: I quit wow since MoP, I think classic/sod/DF brought in a lot of new player. I really don't know for sure tho but with the trilogy xpac I think hype is building
[3:49:33] Foggie: @y0rge Every MMO made after WoW hit mainstream in 2005.
[3:49:45] SticksonTV: We need more MMOs not just 1 big imo
[3:49:56] fennrirq: I hope you might assume that RIOT also working on PvP and PvE comnent so that's very copium to hope that both games will be at the same level
[3:49:57] BadaaBeng: apparently everybody loves your hair today rooNya  maybe u need to wear it for ever now Kappa

[3:50:25] ramfunky: Hasn't riot MMO been out for years? I remember they made one like 15 years ago I thought at least, was very bare tho I think
[3:50:39] taterthecreator: i played eso for like 5 years then switched to wow cause it died, but console mmos are very laggy
[3:50:47] Eiya: @AceReformed women have this really cool thing we do where we can just accept compliments at face value we have to downplay ourselves first dw its not you
[3:50:55] Eiya: *cant
[3:51:27] fennrirq: @Naguura anyway let's hope that The War Within will be a banger
[3:51:29] Fausstty: @Eiya 🥰 my fav AWC host peepoHappy
