[5:07:01] neuronutz: so you can strategize your dungeon runs and based upon said strategizes get better times/rewards?
[5:08:01] iLikeFishHead: WAIT, even TEAPOT is plaing WoW now?!?!
[5:08:01] aFlyingGuru: ye thats what we did on 27, we depleted it later but the pull was smooth
[5:08:29] emecci: damn, thats quite puggable
[5:08:43] Edeslash: wideWalk
[5:09:02] Glebk0: how to know if pugs can handle the zased pulls though?

[5:12:28] emecci: people manage 29s no comms just by loosely assigning orders
[5:13:01] Edeslash: our rise 27 had 12 deaths including 1 full wipe and we timed it with 2 seconds left NAILS
[5:13:17] emecci: im sending this throne 26 quick
[5:13:19] neuronutz: how does composition work within the squad? is there a meta comp?
[5:13:27] Glebk0: i am now at 2.7-8k playing prot pal, only pugging, want to get to 3k, pugs are really random to me, maybe i should somehow filter people better
[5:14:08] neuronutz: interesting
[5:15:24] aFlyingGuru: 2 mob pull HOLY
[5:15:44] neuronutz: I think I like the concept of not being able to get every buff/boon in the game in any one squad
[5:16:19] hatad: Thats a cool addon its like a nfl playbook
[5:16:29] aFlyingGuru: day 1 of the season vivilouf was chaining the keeper for 5 pulls, full healing him in sanguine repeatedly
[5:16:37] aFlyingGuru: considerably zased
[5:16:45] neuronutz: it makes the squad comp. more interesting  in my opinion
[5:16:51] Tritophs: do you think you can carry harder on tank or on healer in m+?
[5:16:56] Glebk0: yea, i haven’t really got into making my own routes, just feel like i lack game knowledge a bit to do that. but i do know mostly what i can handle safely
[5:16:57] emecci: the throne ended
[5:17:00] emecci: within a single pull
[5:17:00] lord_konstantine: Cheat code to get to 3k as any tank - join groups with mistweaver healers and know the routes pepeLaffington Its a spec that can heal through shit even if the player is bad

[5:17:58] limeoflight: so what you're saying is WoW needs a downed state?
[5:18:36] hatad: You mean snizzle play easy role and do nothing;<
[5:18:56] Tritophs: oh, so it's not like people are taking 20% dmg per sec or something and you need to keep your party alive constantly?
[5:19:02] Snizzlenose: RAGEY
[5:19:08] lord_konstantine: Why do healers go only for the toxic tanks? PepeWhy
[5:19:32] neuronutz: I can imagine many different situations where optimization of squad comp. is key to survival and yet some squad compositions could be fun and challenging
