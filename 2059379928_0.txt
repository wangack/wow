[4:49:14] TY_Dunston: roids dont kill hair i have dreads
[4:49:15] Ferfin: @Pixhull lol Calling people boss isn't the move homie. I know the point. He wanted it, he's not ashamed of his hair loss, he just wanted to have a better hair line. He put out a video about it instantly to advertise it.

[4:49:38] chrisnicole1: mirror is dealdy
[4:49:40] inhaledthc: dude hair is hair it falls on men gg xD
[4:49:41] hot_coffee_enema: body dysmorphia is mental illness

[4:50:06] TY_Dunston: @kingceejay90 way more fam
[4:50:09] sonoma121: kylie jenner
[4:50:12] itsHomicydal: it depends on what kind of veneers you get, some of them are made to look natural
[4:50:15] sage_yu: if you have perfect white teeht you look like a fucking skinwalker
[4:50:16] Ishida375: u think drake got his thing enlarged then?
[4:50:20] poexone: breh there is a huge industry behind hair restoration and men
[4:50:30] sonoma121: drake def paid for his cocki

[4:51:40] iiTz__Reflex: Just delaying the inevitable
[4:51:41] happyheals: but hair transplant will
[4:51:41] Ferfin: You think a guy that spends his life in front of judges, being judged on his appearance, can't be insecure about his hair, or want to look better?
[4:51:43] inhaledthc: i know what you are saying but he is balding and it doesnt matter if ur rich or strong or beautifull u will want ur hair back lol
[4:51:43] happyheals: lol
[4:51:46] Pixhull: it will be just finding the next insecurity.
[4:51:47] sage_yu: thats like installing cheats and winning in others eyes but you know your a moron in reality
[4:51:48] ZChord: fax
[4:51:51] fearsii: what about getting a few inches on your shaft is that okay?
[4:51:54] drfeltgood: For anyone who needs a ref for Cbum: https://imgur.com/a/zI9uXkQ
[4:51:58] wiseimp: man spitting facts
[4:52:03] chrisiirc: death of an ego is the best thing

[4:54:34] MadbadQT: getting a transplant is an action 🤣🤣🤣
[4:54:35] pmanfit91: It might have more to do with the competitions. Judge's don't admit it, but any "flaw" they see, they'll dock.

[5:04:16] poexone: That kill on Exciz was nice
[5:04:20] lazyturtle0824: Facts
[5:04:29] ItsRoxasXD: fistweaver just needs to be removed from the game
[5:04:31] sonoma121: spriests is literally slow low damage and just all around poo
[5:04:40] poroyou: I feel like, last week you did so well, all of your competitors went back and did their homework
[5:04:40] eygton: what’s ten tenths?
[5:04:43] notseee: @pikabooirl are you running 4 set as sub?
[5:04:49] inhaledthc: can u turn music louder :D
[5:04:52] sonoma121: AGREED @ItsRoxasXD
[5:04:56] goinginsane: so who is gonna be learning a new class to change the comp?
[5:04:56] Narsarus02: @eygton 10/10
[5:04:58] eygton: like should wizk play warlock?
[5:04:59] XyranthiaRose: That kill you made on the warrior was insane though my jaw was on the floor.
[5:05:10] enhancedrane: did you consider playing sub instead of pirate rogue?
[5:05:18] sonoma121: fistweavers are so cheap
[5:05:21] eygton: @narsarus02 like playing perfect?
[5:05:25] MitchFlori: they had the strats
[5:05:29] Narsarus02: @eygton pretty much, yeah
[5:05:38] guesswhofoo: thats filthy
[5:05:39] poexone: Wiz was getting trained so hard.
[5:05:48] NoChillPrims: sounds ass
[5:05:56] nicyb93: Who are the top 3 players?
[5:06:06] ItsRoxasXD: LMFAO GET EM PIKA
[5:06:09] Retrospecs55: what went wrong with the god comp yall had
[5:06:11] ryooikitenkai: xdddd
[5:06:13] ohshiieett: you shoulda just played sub
[5:06:14] Ryso33: yea that was a pure counter
[5:06:15] ryooikitenkai: the shots
[5:06:16] eygton: if wiz played warlock you think you woulda been better?
[5:06:17] emmywiink: But who took the decision to stick with the comp???
[5:06:19] ryooikitenkai: LUL
[5:06:19] goinginsane: sp is so good, was wondering why you guys didnt change up
[5:06:24] midgard_mamba: do you think that sub would be better than outlaw in that matchup?
[5:06:30] Levon117: cant you sub in jellybeans?
[5:06:40] Levon117: wouldnt bm hunter be better into that
[5:06:44] Kanooog: @eygton They would suffer too, should have been Jelly on Mage
[5:06:47] icratosx: Pika, I am committing to playing rogue.
[5:06:49] XyranthiaRose: I don’t think playing sub was the move, chat. Wiz shouldn’t have been playing SP.
[5:06:52] t_bud10: set up my binds.. go in the arena and all where back to fucked up so i had no binds
[5:06:54] guesswhofoo: even ele can hex every 15
[5:06:54] revan62: ele
[5:06:58] sonoma121: bruh listening to a baby on the track
[5:07:04] Darkminst: Drama PauseChamp
[5:07:05] Pack7: @Levon117 potentially - pet cleave gives mistweaver more throughput tho
[5:07:05] ItsRoxasXD: We needed the fuckin Pikaboo Warrior
[5:07:05] americanmoses18: cheesier than frost dk/dev? lol
[5:07:07] saptoablind: The game for 2-2 was close but should of went healer for the kill imo. The 1 win for you was all you imo!
[5:07:10] whiteboy1136: fuck le pomp all my homies hate le pomp
[5:07:11] sonoma121: what in the fuck was that on the song?
[5:07:12] eygton: @kanooog how come jelly didn’t play?
[5:07:14] QuanahPlays: Had to be carls idea to run sp
[5:07:17] poroyou: have to relog @t_bud10
[5:07:21] ohshiieett: still don't get why you wouldn't sub with spriest
[5:07:23] blueblrrrd: more jelly
[5:07:28] ItsRoxasXD: Pikaboo warrior wouldnt have lost that fr
[5:07:28] enhancedrane: did you think of switching to subtlety?
[5:07:30] meepmonkmw: rmd defo wouldve had a chance
[5:07:30] XyranthiaRose: Dude that triple cheap you had to secure the kill was wild though. Good job there.
[5:07:32] crazycorgis: so the move is now in gauntlet?
[5:07:33] Kanooog: @eygton He played one but with SP, if he played with Rogue instead
[5:07:34] WoWitzBron: how come no rmd but spmd
[5:07:42] Levon117: arcane is probably the way
[5:07:49] whiteboy1136: @Pikabooirl
[5:07:50] eygton: Mhmmmm
[5:07:53] whiteboy1136: why is sub so bad now?
[5:07:56] lazyturtle0824: Any of RMX RLX or MLX
[5:07:56] brannas19: Still got a shot at the big prize next cup?
[5:07:58] Javimcm: Who plays arcane in the team?
[5:08:01] sonoma121: why dont i ever see arcane mages in pvp
[5:08:01] Kanooog: Rogue / Mage have always been annoying since Arena released
[5:08:02] Narsarus02: Does it matter with ranking or smth that you placed 15th cup 2 or?
[5:08:05] Ryso33: yea
[5:08:05] cdeeze2: i think Rog Mm can work into that
[5:08:06] Levon117: sub cant one shot people anymore
[5:08:09] goinginsane: they chose it just to counter you
[5:08:09] Levon117: at least good players
[5:08:09] XyranthiaRose: Like was Wiz just super adamant on only playing SP or something? No shade just curious.
[5:08:10] shanked87: i enjoyed watching it either way i reckon well done
[5:08:10] Palumor: I was praying on their downfall so hard
[5:08:12] propsleako: spriest just bad
[5:08:12] afoscastro: why does it feel like if it was in cup 1 you would win anyway with same comp
[5:08:14] cdeeze2: carl couldnt play sham tho
[5:08:19] cdeeze2: have to go priest or Hpa
[5:08:28] cdeeze2: resto druid
[5:08:29] cdeeze2: i guess
[5:08:46] Kanooog: @WoWitzBron Exactly, but know they know right?

[5:09:33] ItsRoxasXD: Wait is the warrior Jaime?
[5:09:34] Kanooog: I'm excited for the come back games coming up.
[5:09:37] ohshiieett: and yet you spam played the comp into it lol
[5:09:43] gorilahazed: why didnt you guys go with the melee cleave

[5:12:00] brannas19: You nervous to go up against euro teams?
[5:12:13] rebelzwow: bring our the pika monk
[5:12:18] PainezZ: void has 140 pts and you guys have 160
[5:12:20] Kanooog: @happyheals Wiz is the best Spriest in the world and the only one even playing in the Tourney.
