[1:12:43] YENNII: Don't set it to 0, you'll get a promt email to pay for the shipping yourself or the buyer
[1:12:47] Taylor131313: the protection was default on this time though, wtf
[1:13:15] Wardrick7: Shipping Costs (incl. protection) €5.00
[1:13:22] Taylor131313: yeah just turn off protection
[1:13:26] Celc1us: is it still called shipping if its by truck? or train? or airplane? anniesP
[1:13:28] th3b1g5h0w: No wonder those delivery guys don’t get raises 🤔
[1:13:36] YENNII: Oh yeah, in that case you need to set it to 0. :)

[1:15:27] joppe30: are you playing retail or classic ? :D
[1:15:28] CriusSolari: @AnnieFuchsia It seems like the issue is Amazon (or other places) ship to throne, the @ you set is to cover Throne shipping to you

[1:16:21] YENNII: take Etsy as an example, then you need to add the shipping and taxes, to the shipping amount. Sites that offer free shipping you set it to 0
[1:16:48] Taylor131313: default is scam xddDespair now we know

[1:20:25] GHOST97915: yeah
[1:20:34] Collnaris: wat
[1:20:36] CriusSolari: so 6.5$ to ship it?
[1:20:42] Sne4ky79: wtf
[1:20:46] GHOST97915: shipping is insane
[1:20:51] pain_thing00: NotLikeThis
[1:20:57] th3b1g5h0w: fuel isn’t cheap
[1:21:04] Cx_is: throne likes toa dd processing fee,shipping,sales tax so comes out so expensive
[1:21:06] Taylor131313: anniesNotLikeThis
[1:21:10] repelsteeltje88: do they just add a small difference to the item as shipping and then the additional costs gets topped on it depending on where you live?
[1:21:19] Taylor131313: they order individually? that's super weird
[1:21:24] GHOST97915: @AnnieFuchsia there's a lot of issues with shipping right now due to the geopolitical situation, a lot of the convinient shipping routes aren't available at these times :)
[1:21:42] Collnaris: LULE
[1:21:49] Belandrial: KEKW
[1:21:53] Ropy123: ban them
[1:21:55] Geoffku: DANKHACKERMANS

[1:22:14] Ms7Mido: DANKHACKERMANS
[1:22:24] Collnaris: the business offers it, they should provide it 5Head
[1:22:26] bappo_likes_ck: XDDD
[1:22:34] PneumaWHU: Was that for Perfume Travel Pack?
[1:22:35] nanerx: Difrent wherehouses
[1:22:48] Belandrial: I'm being charged extra shipping Sadge
[1:22:53] Webzagar: Different warehouses probably.
[1:22:58] PneumaWHU: I ordered that, with some other items from Shein in same order
[1:23:26] Taylor131313: is this the equivalent of console limitations?
[1:23:26] Bloodmatch: Now lets talk about swedish customs and post nord LUL
[1:23:37] nanerx: IF 1 item is in 1 place and other item is in other place ...they cant put it in same shipment coz difrent company send them
[1:23:42] Belandrial: Let's talk about the SA Post Office Kapp
[1:23:52] bappo_likes_ck: postMORD
[1:23:54] nastye: what if the wares are kept in different warehouses
[1:23:54] Sne4ky79: postnord sucks @Bloodmatch
[1:24:20] Wardrick7: why are people overthinking this LUL
[1:24:21] Collnaris: they must only order products individually, not sure why they couldn't just tell that it's going to the same place forsenThink
[1:24:22] nanerx: yes but productions are diffrent
[1:24:25] Bloodmatch: @sne4ky79 oh i know based on xmas po box
[1:24:36] nastye: not unlikely
[1:24:40] th3b1g5h0w: There’s a guy in shipping scamming everyone. come on people don’t ruin Habibs Shipping scam income
[1:24:52] Sne4ky79: middleman costs , they take extra cut?
[1:24:57] Wardrick7: they just order one by one cause its simple for them and they dont care about shipping as they are not the ones who pay
[1:24:58] Collnaris: what
[1:25:04] repelsteeltje88: if they are different orders then "automatically" would make sense. But if you ask them to put it together they should be able to put them together. Kappa  Cant you cancel all 3 and order them as one package otherwise?
[1:25:15] Taylor131313: 5% cut is fine, +90% for shipping isn't fine LULE
[1:25:22] CriusSolari: @th3b1g5h0w Its how he supports all his African princes, and those tax auditors with your refunds

[1:25:50] th3b1g5h0w: let’s play some game. I got a backpack but me some Oreos and I’ll deliver it 🥸
[1:25:55] repelsteeltje88: wow. but you have like 14 days cooldown period right? Not good money back :D
[1:25:56] th3b1g5h0w: buy
[1:26:08] Wardrick7: they should if they cared, but why would they if they are not the ones paying for shipping
[1:26:24] Game_Rebel: @AnnieFuchsia easy solution... I think. could you just change every item to "convert to payout" so instead of them ordering stuff, it just adds money to your throne balance, and you go buy them.
[1:27:02] CriusSolari: @Game_Rebel That's kinda like buying your own Xmas gifts, slightly worse then buying yourself cake
[1:27:09] Game_Rebel: I see
[1:27:18] Taylor131313: would clothes not count as company expense if you did that?
[1:27:26] Collnaris: ahh
[1:27:50] Sne4ky79: private taxes purchase vs company taxes purchase
[1:27:52] th3b1g5h0w: lol
[1:27:55] Collnaris: buy a shirt and 5 staplers ez
[1:28:07] nastye: anything that entertains us is company purchase for sure
[1:28:19] Game_Rebel: then throne just needs to add an option to add multiple items as one. so like, you create new gift "A" which includes items "x" and "y" ...only downside, nobody could buy you JUST x or y individually, would have to be both. but that could solve it
[1:28:21] th3b1g5h0w: I bought $20,000 worth of clothes but it’s for the business 🤔
[1:28:29] CriusSolari: @Collnaris Or 3 staplers, 2 priced at a shirt price, and 1 at a Hue light price lol
[1:28:59] Wardrick7: throne could easily solve it but they need a benefit for it. right now it seems it does not benefit them
[1:29:18] Collnaris: inb4 there's a sudden extra cover charge KEKW
[1:29:20] Taylor131313: I don't know if it's every time, but the protection thing was default on for the 0 shipping item
[1:29:23] Cx_is: 👁️
[1:29:23] Breather37: You think that’s bad? I ordered band t shirts from impericon for 2400kr, and fedex is charging me 9300kr in import taxes. From germany to norway. Ordered from there before and never paid tax on it
[1:29:25] Taylor131313: I had to turn it of manually
[1:29:29] repelsteeltje88: buy lots of clothes and  put "jaina costume - very expensive i know"
[1:29:52] darksibelia: HIYA all
[1:30:03] Belandrial: That sounds like some SA shipping/import taxes LUL
[1:30:10] Celc1us: ill import my foot in fedex ass anniesP
[1:30:28] jokuTM: @Breather37 Maybe they think its 2400 usd or eur?

[1:33:40] nastye: gabbie also has a business major so surely she would know
[1:33:41] ChrismatiQ: every company in sweden offers work clothes, and she needs work clothes, thats why it should be no tax

[1:36:38] Matt07k: Annie when you go to some events you also probably write off your travel expenses to your company, right? So I guess it should work the same with clothes and makeup, whatever you need for that event FeelsThinkingMan
[1:36:38] jokuTM: From Finnish tax authority: "A tax deduction can be granted for work clothes if the work uniform cannot be worn other than for work tasks or if the clothing expenses are substantially higher than usual because the work consumes a particularly large amount of clothing or the work is particularly dirty." Don't know how in Sweden.

[1:37:55] CriusSolari: Reimburse yourself
[1:37:59] Enrisin: mileage cost
[1:38:11] repelsteeltje88: kilometer allowance thingy?
[1:38:12] Wardrick7: you cant? we have company cards made for petrol here LUL
[1:38:42] Nilese: it's usually better to claim a price per mile than receipts for fuel (in the UK anyway)
[1:38:48] Zenitslav: does the company or you own the car?
[1:38:49] Collnaris: ye company cards usually always covers petrol LUL
[1:38:49] jokuTM: @Wardrick7 Annies car is not a work vehicle

[1:40:03] Alastor7783: you said CN last night ?
[1:40:03] The_Tank_Hunter: I used to be able to claim 24 cents to the km at my old job. I would just print off a Google Maps of the journey showing total KMs and submit that with a summary page. 100% worth laiming
[1:40:15] SskygamesS: my god who design razorthorn rise race
[1:40:28] duodeath21: aah,. reimburse it to your company, as long as you get your receipt and write it off, i think
[1:40:50] Sne4ky79: milage cost is quite low though compared to fuel cost filling tank up vs a company fuel card @AnnieFuchsia
[1:40:51] skibbatv: @The_Tank_Hunter OMEGALUL this is funny

[3:23:39] Taylor131313: he decided to leave, he wasn't laid off
[3:23:58] Implied_Slight: I guess Microsoft is moving in their own team and some are just leaving
[3:24:16] Taylor131313: "Allen Adham, Blizzard’s chief design officer, is also leaving the company." that's also not good

Now that he has seen the acquisition through as Blizzard’s president, he has decided to leave the company,” says Microsoft’s game content and studios president Matt Booty in an internal memo.
[3:25:39] Morgonbladet: at least tied somehow right

[4:40:42] valianya: It's interesting that they cancelled the survival game right after Palworld has a huge launch and Enshrouded is looking great and they're both survival games.  They said the layoffs were removing positions that had overlap elsewhere.  I wonder if other MS studios are further along in other survival games so they axed the Blizzard project to keep the other studio's survival game instead.  But that's narrowing the games market after the acquisition, which is opposite of what everyone else wants.

[5:40:26] Twigbot4k: USB cams, on average, are very USB needy.  From what I have read and heard, they have to be direct USB plugged.  They throw fits if plugged into a USB hub.
[5:41:06] Collnaris: ^that's what i was thinking Hmmm

[5:59:00] Taylor131313: nah
[5:59:08] RockemSockem0821: have you experienced the kernal 41 error?

[5:59:14] wpprrz: You can filter event logs to only show criticals @AnnieFuchsia
[5:59:20] GI__Jose: monkaSTEER  crash
[5:59:25] Fjarnskaggl1337: bajHorde bajAlly

[5:59:56] SeltzerWater_927: LOL
[6:00:03] wpprrz: Does it crash or bluescreen? THey have different IDs @AnnieFuchsia
[6:00:05] Taylor131313: 17:53
[6:00:17] wpprrz: Reboot or bluescreen*
[6:00:23] Collnaris: YEP
[6:00:42] wpprrz: @AnnieFuchsia filter by event id 41?
[6:01:53] wpprrz: @AnnieFuchsia youre under admin event logs
[6:02:00] bYTEfROG: event viewer crashed Kappa
[6:02:01] wpprrz: @AnnieFuchsia need to be under system event logs
[6:02:01] jla_1: another directory?
[6:02:38] scriptkid_rs: Yes
[6:02:41] wpprrz: Filter Current Log > Change All Event IDs to 41
[6:02:42] scriptkid_rs: I do this for my job
[6:02:46] Taylor131313: probably not something which triggered an error log which is super annoying
[6:02:46] scriptkid_rs: Can u filter on id 4101
[6:03:01] wpprrz: 4101 is bluescreen no?
[6:03:02] kashynia: onedrive made mine blue screen so I deleted it.
[6:03:18] wpprrz: Its not bluescreening
[6:03:27] wpprrz: 41 or 4101 will eb fine
[6:03:28] Taylor131313: that's just "the system has rebooted" though
[6:03:29] SilverDr4cthyr: @AnnieFuchsia Or perhaps your computer might have semi-hidden malware... such as "csrss.exe"...
[6:03:30] Taylor131313: it's not useful
[6:03:42] Taylor131313: ?????
[6:03:51] kashynia: did just the game crash?
[6:03:59] Prrophett: What kinda sites are you VISTING Annie HMMMM
[6:04:02] wpprrz: From those websites Kappa
[6:04:10] Sne4ky79: usb crash?
[6:04:14] Mongbat25: So just a error liek crash to desktop or not responding crash
[6:04:24] Collnaris: can your druid inv my hunter
[6:04:24] shoutyrae: Locked up
[6:04:26] ChrismatiQ: so the pc "froze"
[6:04:32] RockemSockem0821: kernal 41 isnt technically a crash it just restarts
[6:04:34] wpprrz: Thats a freeze
[6:04:36] wpprrz: Not a crah
[6:04:41] kashynia: have you got the latest drivers? sounds like a USB error
[6:04:49] AlfredK: I had reaaaally weird issues with my PC when I was using icue before. Then I stopped it on startup and everything worked.
[6:04:51] danuttah: Not all crashes will show in event log - soemtimes might need to read the crashdump file, which is not simple. A bluescreen would be logged, a complete lockup may not be
[6:04:56] Sasco1st: So your new PC is doing this?
[6:04:57] ravennl: check the windows crash dump. Could use a reader for that
[6:04:57] InwardXenon: I had a kernel power crash before and it was because a cable from PSU into mobo had come loose
[6:04:58] trax314: i'd go to reboot event in the log and look back in time from there
[6:05:05] Mongbat25: was a driver update yesterday
[6:05:06] RockemSockem0821: 41 is just a restart
[6:05:07] Atomicburst: Nothing in application?
[6:05:07] Taylor131313: yeah I think it's just not logged since it was a lock-up and not a straight up crash
[6:05:15] wpprrz: Seems power deliviery or driver related
[6:05:21] kashynia: might need motherboard specific drivers
[6:05:21] jla_1: i think theres new update from yesterday
[6:05:22] Aegis_2566: Did you update your BIOS etc ever since you got your new PC?
[6:05:32] wpprrz: Its not rebooting thoguh chat

[6:06:10] Toiarc: Just check if there is problem with your updated bios and update new one if need be?
[6:06:13] ChrismatiQ: how many Watt is the PSU?
[6:06:14] Sasco1st: have another PSU you could test?
[6:06:15] Taylor131313: might be a faulty USB device, isn't icue stuff also powered by USB?
[6:06:22] kashynia: there is a settings that makes usb go sleep in the power settings

[6:06:43] bYTEfROG: no
[6:06:45] ChrismatiQ: no
[6:06:49] Taylor131313: because you said that fans stopped spinning too
[6:06:50] bYTEfROG: they have their own plugs on the mainboard
[6:06:52] wpprrz: What Power supply do you have? @AnnieFuchsia
[6:06:56] wpprrz: No
[6:06:58] InwardXenon: Blue Screen Viewer ios good but not sure if it reads all crash reports
[6:07:02] Taylor131313: didn't you plug the fans into the commander thing
[6:07:02] Aegis_2566: THe hub is powerd with pcie, connected with the usb pin to give info to the pc
[6:07:03] Sasco1st: if the fans are connected to a corsair commander hub....?
[6:07:04] AnnieFuchsia: !originspecs
[6:07:04] Nightbot: NEW PC SPECS: https://i.imgur.com/3lhuhFB.jpeg
[6:07:21] Aegis_2566: Her PSU is more than fine
[6:07:22] Sasco1st: the hub itself might be connected to a USB port
[6:07:25] ChrismatiQ: oh, thahts plenty of power
[6:07:26] erwin_mulder: Fans themselves are not USB, but the rgb part maybe is
[6:07:28] wpprrz: Rm1200 should be more than enough to power everything
[6:07:28] ravennl: type: windows dump file...should give more info then eventviewer
[6:07:33] wpprrz: Thank you
[6:07:33] Taylor131313: RM1200x is one of the best PSUs around, I would be very surprised if it's the issue
[6:07:45] Collnaris: monkaS
[6:07:46] Aegis_2566: What
[6:07:46] kashynia: it could be a thing using too much power
[6:07:51] SilverDr4cthyr: semi-hidden malware like the one I mentioned is under Processes of the Task Manager, and cannot be ended  & needs a reliable professional to ensure that it is fully removed... Some pc supply places in the supply chain might occasionally load it on PCs, to ensure that you have to buy PCs, & their peripherals more often.
[6:07:57] wpprrz: If its a prebuilt PC it's unlikely to be hardware related.
[6:08:00] Frodo1978: the event viewer need some time to write the logs, if the crash forces the reboot to fast you will see no entry
[6:08:10] Sasco1st: yeah if the issues traveled over, a peripheral seems likely culprit
[6:08:11] wpprrz: @SilverDr4cthyr It's not going to be malware
[6:08:16] AlfredK: Does it happen often? Maybe try to use the PC with iCue disabled for a while. @AnnieFuchsia I had a similar issue before.
[6:08:20] Taylor131313: @SilverDr4cthyr you don't know what you're talking about, the process you mentioned in particular is a critical windows process
[6:08:24] wpprrz: Overthinking it if you think its malware
[6:08:28] Aegis_2566: She has icue link, thats one single hub thats powered via pcie cable, the usb that goes into the motherboard is mainly for information transfer
[6:08:32] Taylor131313: everyone has csrss.exe running
[6:08:33] Collnaris: is it working fine right now?
[6:08:36] ChrismatiQ: how long have you had your camera?
[6:08:55] InwardXenon: Annie, have you tried reseating all your PSU cables? Sometimes they just come loose and can cause issues like this
[6:08:56] SilverDr4cthyr: @wpprrz I know from experience that it IS, because my pc had the same issue
[6:09:07] Zuleyus: @SilverDr4cthyr csrss exe is not malware, it's literally a core component of windows
[6:09:14] Taylor131313: ^
[6:09:14] erwin_mulder: It can be some sort of wonky powermanagment on one device .. I had a harddrive that would go to sleep and when it had to wake up, it halted all IO while it was spinning up.
[6:09:17] ChrismatiQ: maybe the camera is overheating and causing some small shortcircuit
[6:09:22] wpprrz: @SilverDr4cthyr I work for an MSP, your single experience doesn't explain general issues
[6:09:29] kashynia: could be the USB devices being naughty
[6:09:38] Atomicburst: is your keyboard usb or wireless?
[6:09:45] Aegis_2566: No, if hte camera is overheating it will shut down automatically because of safety
[6:09:47] InwardXenon: I'm not saying it's the PSU, I'm saying it could be the cables going into the mobo, sometimes they come loose due to heating up
[6:09:48] Taylor131313: yeah you mentioning the camera being really warm makes me think it could be the issue
[6:09:51] loppish91: use the 4k camera Pog
[6:09:54] Wardrick7: but then you would know camera is the issue
[6:10:02] ChrismatiQ: but if it freezes your streaming pc you know for sure that the cam is faulty
[6:10:06] bYTEfROG: @Zuleyus there is a virus that uses the same name for the exe, you have to check the folder it is in. still far fetched that it's malware

[9:20:25] polygoncoke: The soaking mechanic was interesting but the los mechanics were horrible
[9:20:26] tonibeeswax: as a noob we missed out on so much
[9:20:34] xurnuxien: anniesPoint CHAT always AGREES Kappa
[9:20:43] Alastor7783: I accidentally baited the whole raid LULW
[9:20:47] vigorz: @polygoncoke what about the one where you have to follow boss commands
[9:20:50] Taylor131313: mythic Argus was an extremely good fight to play when it was current
[9:20:51] Taylor131313: loved it
[9:20:52] vigorz: that was fun
[9:21:20] Darkroman87: I hated the intermission phases of that fight, my guild had major issues with it
[9:21:21] polygoncoke: Yeah decrees were fine. Though another one of those mandatory WA mechanics
[9:21:28] Darkroman87: I liked everything else about it honestly
[9:21:30] Alastor7783: that was my bad, went wrong way and everyone followed me KEKW
[9:21:38] melkisel: I liked Aszhara

[9:23:05] notzemy: Being forced to speak FeelsWeirdMan
[9:23:08] Taylor131313: you needed to communicate even on heroic, that was a lot to ask
[9:23:09] CoolioDoom: I don't think you have any mod named G kek, so defo not looting him.
[9:23:15] politimi_72: @AnnieFuchsia do you have it?
[9:23:16] polygoncoke: I pigged this on Heroic once. *ONCE*.
[9:23:19] Darkroman87: No one wanted to speak on Discord for this fight lol
[9:23:24] JunoDeez: i had the freeze issue in Amirdrassil on Monday. was doing heroic and kept dying cause it would just flash and a few minutes of gameplay would catch up. was rough getting the whimsical fish form for druid. but finally got it
[9:23:44] polygoncoke: *pugged god dammit
[9:24:13] polygoncoke: Actually beautiful raid
[9:24:19] skibbatv: the moon is blood red because Bwonsamdi created a blood moon and raised the dead to fend off the Alliance
[9:24:50] Taylor131313: my favourite raids are probably Antorus, BOD and Nighthold in that order, such good raids
[9:25:07] Alastor7783: Nighthold had the best transmogs
[9:25:13] Darkroman87: Nighthold was a banger
[9:25:47] polygoncoke: I’m so sad I missed NH 😔
[9:25:56] JunoDeez: @alastor7783 absolutely. i got 2 more pieces to have full set. love the set for my death knight
[9:25:58] notzemy: @Taylor131313 Crucible of Storms

[9:26:39] notzemy: Something like that
[9:26:41] Taylor131313: stack together to not freeze
[9:26:43] Darkroman87: Poggers, world first incoming
[9:26:52] GI__Jose: peepoRiot
[9:27:01] Taylor131313: 5 people at max storm intensity, iirc
[9:27:15] skibbatv: this makes me want to play dont starve together again FeelsStrongMan

[9:27:40] Alastor7783: cuz of the darkness in dont starve
[9:27:40] skibbatv: cause freezing I think
[9:27:45] Morgonbladet: @notzemy sounds like dps loss
[9:27:45] Alastor7783: like jaina's freeze fog
[9:28:12] polygoncoke: I literally got invited to a HC pug on my priest just because of that mechanic @notzemy
[9:28:19] JunoDeez: I played on/off wow for last 20 years with maximum time off of 6 months. but I didn’t do raids and dungeons. was afraid I would mess up and didn’t have anyone to play with. but this last year I just started doing random joins and a bunch of solo mythic stuff on ones i can solo
[9:28:22] Taylor131313: don't need to call me out like that
[9:28:27] Taylor131313: Kapp

[9:29:21] notzemy: 5 minutes of tactics, 5s killing the boss
[9:29:29] GI__Jose: BinoculousTogether  Mount ?
[9:29:43] vigorz: wait so you skip all phases with that?
[9:29:47] polygoncoke: Jesus did you just kill her through the 99% damage shield??
[9:29:47] Meakis: wel there's more in the phase after but it was just 100-0 in 2 sec time
[9:29:52] notzemy: That's good though
[9:30:01] notzemy: Didn't not know we can one phase
[9:30:06] Taylor131313: she does, if she manages to start the transition
