[1:48:14] paradoxyy: This 40 energy mutilate is just way too broken imo, thoughts?
[1:48:16] dayrema: is it the damage it deals too or just energy cost
[1:48:17] michaeltwitcher: 55 at least
[1:48:17] FaxeTV: maybe should have made it 40 energy in combination with chest rune?
[1:48:18] pipigan: !gear

[1:49:39] Nydox: i am a moron, i was using slaughter from the shadows because i thought thats what made my mut 40 energy
[1:49:46] Duckduckgoose38: !talents
[1:49:48] paradoxyy: They proper change should be, slaughter from shadow applies to mutilate .
[1:49:50] sobannz: you can 4 point expose on the cheapshot without opp or seal fate
[1:49:56] sobannz: armor isnt gonna do anything
[1:49:58] T__A_Y: can we see talents?
[1:50:19] WalterweightTV: 1 DAY 1 DAY MAYDAY
[1:50:36] cosmicoriginz: can't you get 5 with hemo too
[1:50:42] fayde123: seems devs play rogue
[1:50:50] sobannz: hemo is 1 cp for 35 energy and does probably less than half the damage
[1:50:50] BekPhazzy: if u compare this buff to other class updates its ok to have this 40 energy :D
[1:50:51] wazzke: Yeah, no problem
[1:50:54] wazzke: :D

[1:52:14] michaeltwitcher: hunters don’t have flair yet do they?
[1:52:31] medskie: maybe blizz thinks its rogues time to be OP, priest and hunter had phase 1. phase 2 belongs to rogues :)
[1:52:33] wazzke: We have been owned by them for 3 months, its finally our turn :P

[1:55:15] chr47: Is rogue gonna be the hunter of this phase?
[1:55:17] waffle977: start thinking about youtube name for that
[1:55:20] lonzo_22: its our time to shine rogues lets go
[1:55:20] geroiku: LUL SeemsGood
[1:55:38] ExamanteD: If mutilate stays like this, rogs are gonna be busted af. Some middle ground might be needed
[1:55:45] deathaddict1995: main goal of muti buff was pve right ? Like starsurge was overbuffed for pve and just got a very minor nerf?
[1:55:54] sobannz: hahahhahah
[1:55:54] fayde123: backstap useless ability now xD

[1:56:37] Dawius: !talent
[1:56:48] karisa91: kek
[1:56:57] lonzo_22: wonder if players are crying about rogues yet
[1:57:00] lordlaesooor: i dont understand this change. why would you ever use backstab with chest rune now
[1:57:11] frainbr33ze: @Jurassitol u blind?
[1:57:19] causemosmvp: out damage penance LOL
[1:57:23] Genghish: @lokarno check Xaryu, he blinks on top of hunter novas pet then goes on hunt in melee

[1:57:57] karisa91: what daggies u use?
[1:58:11] sparkyliss: Between the ass?`what rune is that
[1:58:13] dayrema: quick draw mutilate and between the ass
[1:58:18] ye1l: @lordlaesooor I mean if not for this change, why would u ever use mutilate? goes both ways. And in p1 why would u use anything but saber slash in pve?
[1:58:35] elpillard: healing got nerfed
[1:58:42] krimz123: heals for 5 now
[1:58:43] newmanch: It got nerfed hard
[1:58:51] Lokarno: @Genghish When i blink on hunter, they just flanking strike, pet hits me i die, even with 1.2k hp
[1:58:58] causemosmvp: 80 percent nerf
[1:59:15] ye1l: muti buffs are huge but I think spriest/lock/mage still has favorable matchups into rogues if its a duel between good players
[1:59:15] Jurassitol: I'm on my phone, got 2 turtle daggers
[1:59:16] butterzugzug: @Genghish Blink, nova pet and hunter, move 4 yards and kill him
[1:59:18] Loonz95: will you still play between the eyes when you have kidney?

[2:31:07] miroslavisikiyski: all the ppl I know in Sofia with EVs charge it in the nearest kaufland lol :D
[2:31:08] struci: 50kW charging at a supermarket is quite common
[2:31:09] Istunlocklocalpensioners: still think hybrid is the play
[2:31:16] Istunlocklocalpensioners: and will be for a long tie
[2:31:17] Istunlocklocalpensioners: time
[2:31:21] credshift: With muti you only need to apply crippling on one weapon and leave other for instant or?
[2:31:28] hrungnyr: in germany 50kw is common, and at highway, its 150-300kw
[2:31:33] Waterwalk: I mean, 50% nerf on shadow spells plus dispersion and void plague scaling will be immense
[2:31:37] ufox1: @HeinMuck your so naive
[2:31:42] Istunlocklocalpensioners: fast charge is also shit for the battery right?
[2:31:42] Silkjet001: they dont NEED to charge it at home. they want to go somewhere and do it because they can afford to chill somewhere
[2:31:47] Istunlocklocalpensioners: if that's all you do
[2:31:48] Omiddo: I charge at work only and it works fine
[2:31:50] cryshardcore: groceries take long
[2:32:01] hrungnyr: 50kw in an hour, is 25kw in 30 minutes, thats ok
[2:32:03] struci: same @Omiddo — i could charge at home, but why would I
[2:32:05] gordastico: I thought phase 2 released today?
[2:32:08] ev3rlasting4: @ufox1 He's not naive... That's the main idea behind EVs...
[2:32:13] struci: @hrungnyr 25kWh*
[2:32:20] booddhi: range is ultra important
[2:32:30] Omiddo: Range is only important if there is no infrastructure
[2:32:34] hrungnyr: range is importand, but fast charging is more importand, if you want to travel often and far
[2:32:34] Vishetv: 1shot 500km LUL
[2:32:39] Omiddo: Here in NL there is a charger around each street
[2:32:39] Istunlocklocalpensioners: the tech and infrastructure needs to improve for most people to consider one
[2:32:47] Istunlocklocalpensioners: might take another 20 years
[2:32:51] ev3rlasting4: It depends how you are driving :) You can't go 140km/h and expect it to last 500 km...
[2:32:52] chebupel78: what they should to do with mutilate
[2:32:56] HeinMuck: EVs take power away from Russia
[2:33:00] Vishetv: You know you played waaaaaaay too much wow when you say "1shot 500km" LUL
[2:33:01] cryshardcore: i oneshot 1k km once
[2:33:01] hrungnyr: but if your action radius is just around 200km, that neither capacity nor fast charging is a thing
[2:33:08] hrungnyr: *than
[2:33:09] struci: people think charging is like pumping gas… it's not. you park somewhere, take a piss or buy some snackies and drive on
[2:33:13] dr3ik: Range is sooooo important, I did research and have people who own them and THE RANGE downgrades every year 10 percent. so in 5 ya gonna need a new car or change cells.
[2:33:16] ev3rlasting4: @Vishetv its not that uncommon... :D
[2:33:42] mightyme19: Maybe EVs are not the play. Toyota is going to stop produce and focus more on hybrids
[2:33:44] Istunlocklocalpensioners: Hybrid BIS
[2:33:56] credshift: I think there no way around changeable plug and play battery stations
[2:33:59] struci: 15m at 200kW is nice
[2:34:00] Omiddo: I went to italy from NL this summer
[2:34:04] Devcomz: I just pump and go it takes 3-5 min
[2:34:08] Omiddo: I just fast charged each stop for pee and coffy
[2:34:17] Omiddo: arrived with 50% and never had stress
[2:34:19] struci: @Omiddo NODDERS
[2:34:27] GoatiFTW: pump and dump
[2:34:27] credshift: Imagine just pulling over swapping batteries and going on, as fast as refilling gas
[2:34:27] struci: pump and go is pointless
[2:34:42] Omiddo: @struci exactly , just do normal breaks at fast charge points and your fine\
[2:34:49] GoatiFTW: what is tank size in your car?
[2:34:56] Devcomz: Why is pump and go pointless if I am not hungry or need to use the restroom why should I waste time and stay?
[2:34:57] hrungnyr: Your car CAN do 900km. but do you WANT to drive 900km without a break?
[2:34:59] ev3rlasting4: Diesel sucks...
[2:35:05] cryshardcore: the anti-EV sentiment is so strong in people they don't even care about the benefits
[2:35:13] Istunlocklocalpensioners: diesel should only be used for commercial shit now imo
[2:35:19] Istunlocklocalpensioners: long range trips
[2:35:23] Vishetv: @PsheroTV Just get a truck 4Head
[2:35:27] struci: any EV above ~500km range is wasted on me
[2:35:31] Omiddo: @cryshardcore Once you drive one, you never go back
[2:35:37] dietaryadvice: i never heard about the skoda D-cell
[2:35:48] Omiddo: The smoothness of driving one overshoots any engine
[2:35:50] Istunlocklocalpensioners: DPFs killed diesel for me
[2:35:57] hrungnyr: you should use the WLTP on diesel. its way more accuratute to real world uses
[2:36:00] Silkjet001: of course theres benefits lol
[2:36:04] cryshardcore: not buying an EV nowadays is shooting yourself in the foot long term
[2:36:07] Omiddo: Did you guys see the wireless charging test they are doing in sweden on the volvos? For Taxis
[2:36:15] HeinMuck: Bulgaria is gonna keep getting warmer if you dont buy a Tesla
[2:36:22] Silkjet001: everyone is aware of what a car is for lol
[2:36:26] credshift: Which skoda u ended up with Octavia or Superb? Got a Scala atm but really like Superb @psherotv
[2:36:28] mightyme19: my 1.
[2:36:37] g0dzilla: mechanical engine > everything else... im a car guy and i LOVE engines... even for 10.000€ i wouldnt drive a electrical car
[2:36:41] ev3rlasting4: Diesel sucks.
[2:36:43] Istunlocklocalpensioners: People who just want to  watch WoW and don't own a car be like nadedMbd nadedMbd nadedMbd
[2:36:49] ama__deus: @PsheroTV what do you think about the newest season of Love Island? Kappa
[2:36:59] dr3ik: Do it trade it
[2:37:02] Vehxus: !talents
[2:37:02] StreamElements: https://era.raider.io/characters/us/crusader-strike/Psher%C3%B5
[2:37:04] Sneakybegger: I live in Aus and have a 79 series diesel and wouldnt trade it for the world
[2:37:05] miroslavisikiyski: 10k eur?? Insane
[2:37:11] cripples42069: i drive a 2016 toyota prado manual diesel
[2:37:12] hrungnyr: i drive an BEV (BMW i3s 120Ah) as my daily drive, and racking up 30.000km a year. Thats totally fine. But long distance drives once a year ist not fine, but ok :-) Takes just a little longer
[2:37:13] dr3ik: the suspension is kinda better
[2:37:15] ev3rlasting4: @g0dzilla I bet you are one of those guys that loves the motor rumbling :)
[2:37:16] credshift: Subgoal for Superb
[2:37:28] Istunlocklocalpensioners: DPFs just suck man... I don't like the idea of having to babysit your vehicle so it runs  properly
[2:37:31] dr3ik: A higher class always have better comfy feelin
[2:37:49] miroslavisikiyski: not worth it bro, the difference is way too small
[2:38:06] karlthepimp: @PsheroTV Do you rather use a slow or a fast OH on your multilate spec ? PepoG
[2:38:07] g0dzilla: @ev3rlasting4, i love everything about engines... aslong as it is with the rules of ur country... or on a closed up racetrack
[2:38:15] popeyeformedellin: shkoda on the beat got me rollin on the street
[2:38:27] Devcomz: I do think EV and Gas/diesel will be around together for decades  especially in the US. Americans aren't taking in EVs over their SUV and Trucks and they are a big Auto market
[2:38:36] miroslavisikiyski: that;s insanely overpriced IMO
[2:38:40] Istunlocklocalpensioners: @Devcomz true
[2:38:54] Istunlocklocalpensioners: I honestly don't ever think we will get to a point where it's 100% EV
[2:38:56] slangiz: how many horsepower does your skoda have?
[2:38:57] dr3ik: Wish i had tht money
[2:39:02] Istunlocklocalpensioners: I think ICE will be around forever
[2:39:06] Istunlocklocalpensioners: in some form
[2:39:09] credshift: With muti you only need to apply crippling on one weapon and leave other for instant or?
[2:39:09] miroslavisikiyski: I think  I will stick with my Scala lol :D
[2:39:17] hrungnyr: BEV is perfectly for town and short (<300km) distances. so no huge 2ton battery needed.
[2:39:36] PressKoppXXL: @Istunlocklocalpensioners That's what they said when they started replacing horses.
[2:39:43] hrungnyr: For Industrial and long range green hydrogen would be perfect.
[2:39:46] credshift: @miroslavisikiyski yeah man got a Scala too, love it
[2:39:55] dr3ik: I own a Skoda 2005 and it's so good I bet the new ones are top g
[2:39:55] g0dzilla: does anyone own a evc AND a normal engice car? if so, whats more fun when it comes to driving and enjoying?
[2:39:56] dillingeryoo: Would you say its worht paying 1000 euro or an apartmente with 62 square meters?
[2:40:02] dietaryadvice: is that the new madmonq shirt?
[2:40:02] Omiddo: @hrungnyr Urban countries like NL are perfect for it
[2:40:03] Mymokiller: why are people in bulgaria so addicted to skoda these days ?
[2:40:04] Istunlocklocalpensioners: @PressKoppXXL we'll see I guess
[2:40:06] miroslavisikiyski: @credshift which engine bro? I also love mine
[2:40:10] ev3rlasting4: @Istunlocklocalpensioners That's not the main idea. The aim is to reduce CO2 emissions so that our planet may survive a bit longer :)
[2:40:35] Silkjet001: is it ground floor?
[2:40:36] exstas1234: electric cars are the future
[2:40:38] hrungnyr: @g0dzilla yes i do. BEV is WAY more fun in daily driving. Petrol car ist just for fun at the track. or weekend twisty road
[2:40:52] Istunlocklocalpensioners: hmm...
[2:40:54] miroslavisikiyski: @PsheroTV I am with the 1.0 TSI engine, DSG
[2:40:56] struci: oh no
[2:40:57] cripples42069: they are not the future
[2:40:59] credshift: @miroslavisikiyski smallest one, was my first car 1.0 TSI and got it as accident car, for 12k €
[2:40:59] hrungnyr: the planet will survive, but we wont :-)
[2:41:01] struci: KEKW
[2:41:02] ev3rlasting4: Hell no!
[2:41:05] dietaryadvice: electric cars are the present
[2:41:06] exstas1234: KEKW
[2:41:06] grobi42: i agree
[2:41:06] Istunlocklocalpensioners: lol
[2:41:08] Mymokiller: lol :D
[2:41:08] cripples42069: not hydrogen?
[2:41:10] calybroon: hydrogen fuel cells
[2:41:13] Silkjet001: okay grandpa
[2:41:15] cryshardcore: how?
[2:41:15] aaronmaid3n: electric cars will never be the future
[2:41:18] miroslavisikiyski: @credshift I am with the 1L TSI, DSG and I am very satisfied
[2:41:18] popeyeformedellin: ooo thats is monka payoS
[2:41:19] oldirtybrucie: uranium imo
[2:41:19] Brichard_UwU: sure old man
[2:41:19] ev3rlasting4: Can I go to Mars now, pls?
[2:41:20] Istunlocklocalpensioners: Ok time to take your meds grandad
[2:41:24] ama__deus: I think bicycles are the future YEP
[2:41:24] sacredpotat0: Electric is the future because tis being mandated by law.
[2:41:26] Istunlocklocalpensioners: come and have a seat over here
[2:41:27] MKDarker: i believe in tube televisions
[2:41:29] bakersmb: then why are so many companies investing into hydrogen fuel cells? @PsheroTV
[2:41:30] dr3ik: Petrol is the future. Porche made it out of water and air look it up!!!
[2:41:33] briciu84: horses are the future
[2:41:33] Petrkin: i have 2nd gen Superb with 125kw diesel and its still good af
[2:41:37] hrungnyr: The main reason is to reduce CO2. So stop burning shit!
[2:41:40] g0dzilla: @hrungnyr, fair, thx for ur opinion
[2:41:45] isbjorn90: diesel cant be the future, bacuase of politics. its banned in most citys
[2:41:46] Vetto_7: KEKL
[2:41:48] credshift: @miroslavisikiyski nice, yeah has all you need and great value
[2:41:49] pazlord5: Why? ive been in Bulgaria and some small cars there are making insane noise like truks
[2:41:49] ufox1: @ev3rlasting4 yea go and stay underground
[2:41:51] cryshardcore: diesel is only 20% better for environment than gasoline
[2:41:57] Seemetankin: better DPS fixes everything
[2:42:04] hrungnyr: petrol or diesel produces CO2 when burned, so its not climate neutral.
[2:42:13] Vetto_7: future is tesla ofc
[2:42:14] ev3rlasting4: @cryshardcore "Only"? :D
[2:42:18] ama__deus: Look at those dots ticking for 0
[2:42:19] SnekTV420: joooo the mutilate changes are so big Kreygasm
[2:42:22] ama__deus: Sadge
[2:42:22] calybroon: U are fighting against an agenda already set with diesel, that dream is dead
[2:42:35] dr3ik: I bet no one knoew about Efuel
[2:42:36] Devcomz: @ev3rlasting4 The US is keeping ICE engines alive so we probably won't get full EV all over the world. US is still below 10% of New EVs sold in their auto market.  GM investing in new V8s for their trucks and suvs and are now investing in Hybrids due to the 100% EV route not being the way to go for them. That is the best example I have.  The only way to get full EV on a global scale is to convince Americans
[2:42:40] Seemetankin: priest too strong
[2:42:43] Istunlocklocalpensioners: Electric isn't gonna be  the future imo
[2:42:50] Istunlocklocalpensioners: some other gas
[2:42:55] cryshardcore: @cryshardcore yeah only because you need something that is considerably better in order to meet climate goals. mass adoption of diesel just continues  the path we're on
[2:42:56] dr3ik: It will destroy all of EV industry hah
[2:43:00] nosebleedlol: damn the priest is good
[2:43:04] Istunlocklocalpensioners: EV is a temporary gimmick imo
[2:43:19] buthani: noob
[2:43:24] chebupel78: u still sure mutilate should be nerf?
[2:43:26] linkqt: i feel like bte misses or gets resisted way too often
[2:43:28] ama__deus: if he lives to the second fear, he's sitting pretty EZ helps to resist a stun or two Kappa
[2:43:33] vecloo: try envenom/deadly brew/muti, fuck stunning just dps everyone down lol
[2:43:33] dr3ik: All the tesla owners can start saving cash for new bateries in the next 5 years kekw
[2:43:36] linkqt: kidney shot for life
[2:43:42] g0dzilla: @Istunlocklocalpensioners the future wont be only 1 drive type... they will have to coexist bro...
[2:43:45] Istunlocklocalpensioners: there will something far superior toEVC
[2:43:46] Istunlocklocalpensioners: EV
[2:43:59] ufox1: do you thing mining for batteries is done with batteries ?
[2:44:07] cryshardcore: EV is 40-60% better. batteries are ~90% recyclable in all their materials
[2:44:11] Elo1338: What, no. Batteries are better than Diesel after 35.000 km
[2:44:14] Istunlocklocalpensioners: @g0dzilla true
[2:44:38] funcky1969: Hydroen is the futur
[2:44:39] ama__deus: What's the difference between diesel and petro? FeelsDankMan
[2:44:47] Devcomz: I do agree with a coexistance of ICE and EV but not one phased out for the other
[2:44:47] Vetto_7: I think cars will be banned in the future, public transportation will be the way
[2:44:56] g0dzilla: Because Diesel engines have the most torqu in the lower rpms...
[2:45:00] ev3rlasting4: @Vetto_7 Good luck with that :D
[2:45:00] dr3ik: Ya can make it run on a petrol and gas not just petrol hybrid it becomes even more cheaper
[2:45:02] cryshardcore: just because it doesn't get recycled it doesn't mean it won't ever
[2:45:03] briciu84: hydrogen cara
[2:45:07] g0dzilla: Wich a electric engine does aswell
[2:45:09] funcky1969: Hydrogen is the futur
[2:45:14] struci: Reduce, Reuse, Recycle YEP that's the proper order
[2:45:32] Rotfelsen: true
[2:45:33] nailerak: I'm ok with diesel, as long as it's banned from every city center
[2:45:37] ama__deus: @struci you've never been more German than in this very moment DatSheffy
[2:45:37] Petrkin: ev cars are good in city way less smell and polution
[2:45:38] popeyeformedellin: u dont need cars if they implement our minds online
[2:45:46] struci: @ama__deus oh you have no idea
[2:45:50] ama__deus: KEKW
[2:45:52] dietaryadvice: the need for transportation diminishes
[2:45:54] cmiley33: my phone just fell on my dick
[2:45:56] funcky1969: Hydrogen is the futur
[2:45:56] cryshardcore: there is european legislation being put in place to facilitate recycling of batteries. it will be an industry in itself. EVs are a no brainer if you take everything into account with current tech
[2:46:05] pazlord5: Disel is used still in Bulgaria
[2:46:12] struci: modern diesel is really bad. the particles are so small that your lungs can't filter them

[9:06:22] morghuliz: what offhand do i use for mutilate, dmg or speed?
[9:06:24] MT_DeW_: Hardest 1v1's are meta lock and a good druid for me. Most druids melt but occasionally you find a really good one that is tough.
[9:06:43] zanics: druids priests too hard
[9:06:54] y6mz: a good priest is hard
[9:06:58] zanics: although well see now with 40 energy mutilate

[9:08:14] Erbsosa: watch the stream guys
[9:08:37] MT_DeW_: I am running chipped bite in MH, would ritual dagger/meteor shard/warsong dagger be better in OH right now?

[9:10:14] djbawz_: @PsheroTV  do you need to be behind target like tbc mate?
[9:10:16] captainchocolateman: wait and see how mace coombat come into play
[9:10:17] MT_DeW_: I don't know if it is nerfable though, I think without the mutilate buff we were getting a bit left behind the other specs runes.
