[0:57:04] Srenix: yeah can do
[0:57:20] devzyx: If u see a guy in $300k car and wearing a Rolex safe to assume it's real I reckon
[0:57:27] TempoFlow: i think for a couple of hundred you can get a decent Seiko or something does the job fine
[0:57:28] Annagoeslive: @devzyx ofc
[0:57:39] Urpalmax: But buying a car s objectively a worse investment than a watch, no? I could be wrong, but feels like watches lose less value , you lose 20% on a car as soon as you drive it out of the dealership
[0:57:43] raselsuggy: ye like 15 year old babbar running around with gucci and louis vuitton gear saying its all real
[0:58:21] devzyx: I don't think anything is a bad thing if you enjoy it tbh but as an investment car is bad but you take value from it

[2:14:46] cepsegnever: @kenniflopper ye but the big diference is the arpen u run, with 0 trinkets u are 30-40%, with 1 u are 60%, with both ur 70%+, thats why ppl run dbw sts for warpal mirrors
[2:14:46] pinatairl: isnt the synced trinks what makes it valuable
[2:14:58] kenniflopper: @cepsegnever ok im clueless

[2:15:21] kenniflopper: @Turaxyy
[2:15:24] cepsegnever: let's say AP is kinda whatever, its the last stat u go for, its why u run trinket procs of AP, u wanna have good crit arpen resil before ap @kenniflopper
[2:15:40] cepsegnever: so when u get those AP proc u delete ppl bcos ur good on the rest of stats, basically

[3:09:31] Zevx: if only all the rogues could also exit back to warmane but they will be even stronger on cata KEKW @ozzyxy
[3:09:48] thomasmul: legendary daggers from fl :D
[3:09:51] bamboonas: At least rogues dosen't stun you for 10 sec in cata
[3:09:51] unimonosolo: i like wotlk but i only can play like 2 hours aday
[3:09:52] kooolzin: rogues arent the problem in cata
[3:09:54] kooolzin: X
[3:09:54] ozzyxy: @Zevx bro u finally get a good xpac, its ur time to shine
[3:09:55] ravvqt: wotlk is the best state of wow in my eyes. The Storyline, The PVP, the PVE. Gearing at all. Everything is perfect
[3:10:09] ravvqt: the only thing a bit stupid is rogue 20 seconds cc
[3:10:16] bamboonas: Mop was perfect
[3:10:17] ravvqt: but thats just how it its
[3:10:18] ozzyxy: @Zevx well I guess feral is "good" in wotlk 2s but most matches arent "fun"
[3:10:21] cepsegnever: @ravvqt gearing for pvp sucks wdym
[3:10:26] kooolzin: ye warriors doing 3k dps with mortal strike isn't bad at all
[3:10:26] Zevx: excited for cata definitely, just wish we could put a change in where ferals can shapeshift roots on cata is all Kappa @ozzyxy
[3:10:29] kooolzin: or sacred cleansing
[3:10:32] ravvqt: idk its way better
[3:10:32] kooolzin: or palas with infinite mana
[3:10:33] kooolzin: KEKW
[3:10:37] bamboonas: Gearing in wotlk is miserable as a pvper
[3:10:38] ravvqt: than getting everything for free at retail
[3:10:51] bamboonas: Took me 5 months to get dfo
[3:11:06] cepsegnever: forcing ppl to pve to gear up for pvp is the worst
[3:11:09] ravvqt: gearing in wotlk is bis
[3:11:17] ravvqt: no need to get everything gifet like u at a charity event
[3:11:21] ozzyxy: @Zevx im maining moonkin, cant wait to soothe all of ur savage roars or w.e its calle
[3:11:37] frederychtv: the warrior stream pls?
[3:11:39] bamboonas: In what world is wotlk gearing bis?
[3:11:44] UndeadKillerTBC: moonkin GIGACHAD
[3:11:46] kooshxd: can u soothe savage roar in cata?
[3:11:48] kooshxd: no shot
[3:11:50] ozzyxy: ye
[3:11:54] Zevx: didnt kno u could do that
[3:11:54] ravvqt: its bis cause u have to work an reasonable amount of time
[3:11:57] kooolzin: moonkins are actually a class in cata
[3:12:03] bamboonas: Unreasonable*
[3:12:06] kooolzin: or spec
[3:12:06] ravvqt: not like u get everything for free like retail
[3:12:12] bamboonas: Like I said it took me 5 months to get dfo
[3:12:12] infrex1: Ban GDKPs and gearing would be great
[3:12:13] ravvqt: mhm no mate
[3:12:15] infrex1: Kappa
[3:12:15] bamboonas: Which is absurd
[3:12:20] bonyato: lsd 2.0 Kreygasm
[3:12:22] kooolzin: just dont forget to quit cata in s11
[3:12:24] kooolzin: and its all good
[3:12:38] bamboonas: Took a friend of mine 1.5 years to get rapid ascent on warmane
[3:12:45] ravvqt: if u an unlucky mf i cant help u
[3:12:51] ravvqt: if u want to get everything gifted go retail
[3:12:55] ozzyxy: @Zevx https://cata-twinhead.twinstar.cz/?spell=52610 changed to enrage  :) HONK HONK incoming time to purge it
[3:13:01] ozzyxy: creatin a weakaura now
[3:13:02] bamboonas: Or just play any decent expansion for pvp
[3:13:04] ravvqt: i needed 18 ids back to back for DV HC
[3:13:06] bamboonas: Like cata and mop
[3:13:09] ravvqt: and what did i bitch about it
[3:13:21] ravvqt: i got it and now i fucking deserve it and wear it like a medal of honor

[3:13:51] shozgodx: no1 q'n anymore?
[3:13:53] bamboonas: Another major flaw with wotlk is the fact that one pve item can increase your rating in arenas by 200 or so
