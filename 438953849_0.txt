[6:55:21] Frig0z: Method Way PogChamp
[6:55:24] ythril: stun dont really count as interrupts, since it denies cc on offtargets.. so no.. in that logic.. any caster root it a 8 sec cc on any melee.. so? now u mages can basically almost perma root melee? =perma cc.. slows and blick.. so what u want? caster are too strong
