[1:16:20] KCYON: its objectively not the best to be a single mother. but life surprises you. objective data is NOT conclusive for everyone

[1:42:51] Mahca_: feel like its kinda weird for melee hunter to do so much better than ranged
[1:42:56] paradoxyy: Cuz u are a dumb fck, sp doesnt neked a nerf,if u nerf sp nerf rogue,Lock,ret, hunters
[1:42:56] Eepingmoo: don’t think their nerfing rn, just buffing

[1:43:21] person1029492: warriors are gonna come back in a couple weeks
[1:43:23] juicywiggles: shadow word death needs a nerf (this is coming from a priest main)
[1:43:24] Mertauh: that shows just how broken melee hunter is that they still don't care KEKW
[1:43:25] wavecadet: 100% they nerf armor values
[1:43:27] Yarriq: so what about melle hunter then

[1:43:50] Lunights: yeah fuck hunters
[1:43:51] Mertauh: YEP
[1:43:55] TPBaron: Why is melee hunter so strong? Do they have inherent arm pen or something? (haven't played SOD p2)
[1:43:57] MrChaynes: buff war nerf hunter gg wp
[1:43:57] debauss: ????? why do you hate warriors with pets ????
[1:44:02] Mahca_: they still do decent at ranged then you get close and they nuke you
[1:44:02] ikerislock: Imagine being a hunter and not bringing Lion
[1:44:04] goopunch: Enhancement Shaman are pumping in PvP with double Rockbiter +800 Attack Power. The PvE buffs don't address shaman's need for Way of Earth, so Rockbiter is still going to be played
[1:44:06] Andybobzz: apparently melee hunters are bugged and some damage values arent being normalized
[1:44:06] karlcaliente: no leave hunters alone
[1:44:07] fuguelah: @sinn141 right, so it makes sense that the small minority of gay couples who make the effort to have children have better outcomes. It's doesn't mean gay couples on the whole make better parents.
[1:44:07] arveholm: warriors <3
[1:44:08] Bronloch: Hunters have no offspec role

[1:44:21] person1029492: its mechanical and has high armor
[1:44:24] hxzcc: they wont do shit to hunters, its lie 33% of their playerbase
[1:44:25] bigbuffgoat: melee hunters aint a problem in pvp xD
[1:44:27] MysticalOS: i'd also wager there is a big issue with fact vanilla is designed around only warrior tanks, with 5 stacks of sunder on bosses, and now we have warlocks and rogues and druids and paladins also being more viable at tanking than before. so a game designed around sunder doesn't have a lot sundering
[1:44:28] karlcaliente: hunters are the only pure dps class left in the game, leave them alone
[1:44:28] Raivan994: it's a target dummy boss
[1:44:31] Raivan994: with high armor
[1:44:32] kalrick1: Naw hunters are fine. :)
[1:44:35] Frank4LuLz: NERF HUNTERS AND WARLOCKS
[1:44:38] fukus0da: @blazzedzz yeah? what about it
[1:44:41] MajesticAFx: LUL
[1:44:43] Crusar: it doesn't make sense to be top damage by a mile, and have so much utility at the same time. as a hunter
[1:44:45] Croxssis: They need to bring classes up to par not nerf the ones doing well into the ground
[1:44:52] HeIlraiser_: Warriors getting something crazy at 60, it only makes sense to force people to relevel lol
[1:44:52] anoobistuu11: Maybe it’s possible hunter players are just better mechanically than other class players on average @staysafetv
[1:45:02] hxzcc: imagine the backfire with all the 80iq hunters if they nerf it
[1:45:04] rich5lut: ok nerf hunters
[1:45:05] jallaballan: affliction warlock dots tick for 50 while shadow priests tick for 150?

[2:09:00] wavecadet: is that like 10 lvl difference thing not in game?
[2:09:03] clarky9percent: clarky9percent subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 7 months! 
[2:09:04] Mind_G0bl1n: kill bosses too
[2:09:07] ikerislock: Boosting with the boys
[2:09:11] baurblades: yes
[2:09:13] yungnoob69: go to lvl29 elite dwarves in hillsbrad
[2:09:14] theSalute: I remember they sold sm in classic, it was good exp, maybe its still good
[2:09:14] dreadd39: kanye was right about (them)
[2:09:35] dirbagdan: MOO
[2:09:58] Motelguy: !gum
[2:09:58] Nightbot: SOLD OUT
[2:10:07] rich5lut: This is some high quality testing
[2:10:08] chamlet2764: Staysafe is the content and the fun. not the game
[2:10:10] NutterCircus: Mage cleave is the only way EleGiggle
[2:10:11] jiggeritus: when does gnome reset
[2:10:13] ikerislock: I wanna know if Meta boosting in SM is worth. Or just as a gold farm
[2:10:14] beanman_gaming: @staysafetv take sfk portal
[2:10:16] Plathyy: Will has been staring at the dryer for 30 minutes straight not crying KEKL
[2:10:23] dirbagdan: @dreadd39 he was just repeating what everyone has already known for centuries.
[2:10:31] haodab: dont you get less xp becvuase there need to be more lower lvls in the group. you can just boost yourself and let others tag along no?
[2:10:36] DefaTL: real quick bro what rings are you using?
[2:10:38] command0mil0: bro elite dwarves north wetlands
[2:10:56] TurboBased: @Plathyy pepeLaugh we use the ceiling fan
[2:11:01] ikerislock: @dirbagdan elaborate for us
[2:11:02] chamlet2764: @staysafetv shoot me that invite then
[2:11:23] Mawshaw: @command0mil0 bro, no
[2:11:24] Patriiot8950: I think that in SoD is the system where if you have high level in the group (grey mobs for him) you get almost no xp. Just like in BC/WotLK etc. Anti boosting
[2:11:27] jallaballan: when ur boosting the mobs need to be green for the booster
[2:11:43] chamlet2764: sstvWAT
[2:11:48] MillerHimself: Use your sleeping bag also
[2:11:56] dreadd39: @dirbagdan 100+ countries weren't wrong
[2:11:56] command0mil0: @mawshaw why? they’re level 28-31 and you can pull 3-5
[2:12:09] conspiraciesgamer: how do you aoe tank with demo.. holding aggro is trash?
[2:12:13] Mawshaw: @command0mil0 Open world mobs in contested zone, use your head
[2:12:19] ikerislock: Its not trash
[2:12:40] ikerislock: Meta is BiS tank
[2:12:41] Tricky133: nope druid is pulling mad threat rn
[2:13:06] command0mil0: @mawshaw most people there will be low level if anyone is there
[2:13:09] Tricky133: it does if you have a destro lock that wants to go ham
[2:13:09] wavecadet: Threat doesnt matter
[2:13:12] wavecadet: Damage matters
[2:13:12] CrixVibez: Nothing has more single target threat than a Warlock
[2:13:19] m00n4nds74r: im playing destro meta too, lake of fire is too good
[2:13:23] CrixVibez: Warlock is gapping the other tanks on ST right now
[2:13:23] birgittee: 🌸Hi Safe 😊
[2:13:23] lickmypetals: druid tank has dogshit threat what
[2:13:25] wavecadet: bear dmg is not meta warlock damage
[2:13:34] lickmypetals: warloc tank is the best cause it can kite
[2:13:42] wavecadet: Yes
[2:13:44] mikyki: does mitigation matter at all?
[2:13:47] rbo2992: fact

[2:14:12] Lionkingler1: people already doing 30 min gnomers
[2:14:17] wavecadet: Cuz it looks like it resets on Tues? Then again on weds?
[2:14:20] Desriq__: Are we allowed to say the word here?
[2:14:21] wavecadet: So there is a 1 day lockout?

[2:15:40] TheEndIsNear777: staysafe bugged the game D:
[2:15:40] Mertauh: beta testing :)
[2:15:56] Mind_G0bl1n: multi dollar company
[2:15:58] kurupone: there are so much bugs its insane
[2:16:47] sweatlordkush: there are none
[2:16:47] Lionkingler1: KEKW ICC
[2:16:51] ikerislock: Can't we just sim it?
[2:17:01] Lionkingler1: 650 dps KEKW
[2:17:10] lizcat_: @basedschizo44 in my dreams
[2:17:35] ikerislock: Check bottom 25th percentile lol

[2:17:43] TPBaron: nah we g kicked them
[2:17:46] DefaTL: im thinking about trying it tonight
[2:17:53] TuPpTup: aff is out
[2:17:56] OskarOG: I will be trying affli in my next raid
[2:17:59] OskarOG: as meta
[2:18:15] Randomguy_360: monkaS what did i do
[2:18:23] CrixVibez: Destro is like 300 DPS more, so it'd be hard to find one
[2:18:27] kurupone: dot dmg is to low at this level
[2:18:28] dtl78: @Randomguy_360 KEKW
[2:18:40] Doribob1: inc 100 aff lock parse from staysafe
[2:18:40] nneely1: hard huha
[2:18:47] HeIlraiser_: you rich you do
[2:18:48] usersworld: emberstorm
[2:18:49] Randomguy_360: ember for sure
[2:18:50] rbo2992: i speculate its emberstorm
[2:18:55] ikerislock: Sim it?
[2:18:55] Doribob1: sim it
[2:19:00] ikerislock: That's what they're for...
[2:19:08] CringeK: Overruled
[2:19:13] Utmost777: playing mage is better
[2:19:13] ikerislock: Lol
[2:19:18] renarton: im just making this up but its corruption
[2:19:19] CrixVibez: It's emberstorm if you're still incin/Immo. They're both the highest DPC that you have a llock. Imp COrr would be ahead if you dropped Incin,
[2:19:21] usersworld: emberstorm increases chaos bolts damage by 10%
[2:19:28] Masteve: @StaysafeTV U could lower curup to the GDC time and spend the rest in ember? : ) Just dont move while casting : D
[2:20:50] speedzombie: not a single log on warcraftlogs has haunt as an ability
[2:21:04] CrixVibez: @Masteve It's still more to Just ember since he's still Incin/Immo
[2:21:08] p1ss_minion_suit: TRUE
[2:21:24] CommonTeal: pepeSmoke  󠀀
[2:21:28] jallaballan: im thinking of lvling an affliction warlock, do you think its good for pvp and overall?
[2:21:29] Randomguy_360: nah people have tried to sim it and theres just no way aff ever comes close atm
[2:21:30] p1ss_minion_suit: u think p3 u go fully demo and sac ur pet as tank?
[2:21:31] ikerislock: Imagine Sims being that off lol
[2:21:32] HeIlraiser_: could oif done that in the update, someone data mine the last patch :)
[2:21:34] usersworld: No shot lol. Chaosbolts are critting for almost 4k
[2:21:34] lullokanbier: Try it!!!
[2:21:40] kheap_: how do we like horde vs ally??
[2:21:41] TuPpTup: chaos bolt is critting at 980 at level 31 lol
[2:21:41] OptimusBanana420: want the sim? not sure how well it works. its on github
[2:21:51] DefaTL: problem with aff is ur running nightfall without a good shadowbolt
[2:21:56] CrixVibez: I had a 4600 CB crit last night. It's broken
[2:22:03] p1ss_minion_suit: why?
[2:22:06] m00n4nds74r: come home staysafe
[2:22:06] ikerislock: Give aff a UA rune and they might come ahead later
[2:22:07] MariusBota: have you tried boosting rfc ? any idea how people do it ?
[2:22:13] m00n4nds74r: the alliance misses you

[2:22:35] aBradAbroad: zone maxxing Peggers
[2:22:41] rich5lut: Ill make it to level 10
[2:22:44] MysticalOS: self found zone man?
[2:22:54] haodab: ab rep?
[2:23:02] awkwor_d: enslave demon should be at least 20 secs
[2:23:04] ATcaribou: i kinda wanna do zoneman too, could be fun. maybe i give HC one more chance
[2:23:07] markja629: will official SSF still allow a daily dungeon?
[2:23:12] csh0: where staff

[2:23:19] misterbotijo: I did my frst lock for SOD. Any recommendation for rotations? i start with dots + incinerate + chaos bolt and my dps stay low. What am i doing wrong? TY (average good gear)
[2:23:20] wavecadet: hopefully
[2:23:27] Robbtuck: go demo and buff fire mages Kappa
[2:23:40] rich5lut: Were getting a lot of content nowadays from blizz
[2:23:49] wavecadet: @akabroukcruz lake of fire
[2:23:57] csh0: I love warlock so much but wish affi could have some time in the sun
[2:24:06] SVTSteve: sstvHYPERS
[2:24:08] misterbotijo: OK TY
[2:24:11] Randomguy_360: if aff gets crit dots at 50 it will be good provided fights last long enough
[2:24:12] ikerislock: Lake, Inc, chaos, imo. Then keep it all on CD
[2:24:14] lordextraordinary: RoF?
[2:24:14] vasily_zee: do you throw corruption?
[2:24:24] zezella03: hey guys
[2:24:27] Robbtuck: I heard they are hitting lots of people on era with bans for gold buying lately
[2:24:30] rich5lut: Lake of Fire is a great song
[2:24:34] lullokanbier: Auto follow is off
[2:24:36] SVTSteve: @zezella03 hellooo
[2:24:38] scoobusdoobus: what do you think of gnomer? i feel like p2 is gonna get old quick
[2:24:40] Lionkingler1: YEP
[2:24:48] tactical_rage_quit: @StaysafeTV is it my imagination or when you go to a capitol city and you see 50 sleeping bags all over the place it reminds you of san fran or portland?
[2:24:48] Doribob1: STEVE
[2:24:52] spike82q: Good  thats all era is is gold buyign ad gdkp's
[2:24:53] N_Tys: too much damage done

[2:25:11] wavecadet: true lol
[2:25:12] SVTSteve: sstvLOVE
[2:25:16] seymourmoney: why is it so broken?
[2:25:18] ATcaribou: @scoobusdoobus yeah, i was gigahyped for p2 launch, and now im not even 100% sure if ill keep playing.
[2:25:18] theSalute: just do it
[2:25:30] Mungtime: TRUEING
[2:25:37] misterbotijo: im so stupid i though lake of fire was a passive for rain of fire only...
[2:25:42] Wilson5521: Starting to solo dungeon grind with 25 lock in Stocks, Meta demo or Meta destro better?
[2:25:44] SVTSteve: Ya dog exp flo
[2:26:03] SVTSteve: Evening
[2:26:17] lizcat_: @svtsteve seqWoo
[2:26:18] conspiraciesgamer: filtering by SoD abilities on warcraft logs is bugged so choosing to require haunt doesn't mean anything
[2:26:26] SVTSteve: @lizcat_ sstvHYPERS
[2:26:27] Toastlandx: haunt is king
[2:26:43] Mertauh: haunt is fun AF
[2:26:55] kurupone: haunt should do more damage
[2:26:58] conspiraciesgamer: you actually have to go through hundreds of logs to find an aff lock by hand lol
[2:27:01] Doribob1: you said cock
[2:27:12] Wilson5521: Nice
[2:27:17] ikerislock: Meta and make friends with a mage
[2:27:17] OskarOG: I felt like Meta was better in SM where the mobs hit harder
[2:27:26] Randomguy_360: idk i felt like meta just went smoother
[2:27:31] Randomguy_360: esp with dance bug
[2:27:33] OskarOG: Could actually tank myrmidons
[2:27:57] Lionkingler1: affli is trash
[2:28:08] iknowido: is haunt a rune or talent?
[2:28:12] ikerislock: Twice as good
[2:28:13] itsae__: infinitely
[2:28:15] weituhai: 50/50
[2:28:15] saintopiaa: -5%
[2:28:17] CrixVibez: Liek 300+ DPS
[2:28:19] Randomguy_360: a lot
[2:28:23] sircrumpler: I didn't see which spec, but one warlock spec sarthe showed was literally right under warrior. Like -5% under warrior
[2:28:25] ikerislock: Just about ya
[2:28:31] csh0: you want the link to the sims?
[2:28:37] Randomguy_360: going affliction as raid dps is just trolling
[2:28:44] wavecadet: Top end destro is 800
[2:28:47] wid3e: i managed 300 dps without wbuffs or consumes with full affliction
[2:28:47] wavecadet: Top end off must be 500
[2:28:48] CrixVibez: Aff is atrocious
[2:28:53] conspiraciesgamer: aff might be the lowest damage in the game lol
[2:28:55] Lionkingler1: I would insta kick any affli warlock
[2:29:00] ikerislock: All of fire destro rotation is runes. So it will always do better....until UA maybe
[2:29:00] CrixVibez: Destro is 800 ish, Aff is 550 or so
[2:29:13] saintopiaa: they need to add UA
[2:29:24] LongSnapper99: @StaysafeTV What build you running with meta rune now?

[2:29:39] NaManDatAintMe: demo or afflic
[2:29:46] spike82q: purple mage
[2:29:52] sircrumpler: The dot juggle is more warlock
[2:29:54] Delliceh: so the original classic warlock felt interesting ?
[2:30:00] NaManDatAintMe: its a fire mage
[2:30:07] Toastlandx: we need felfire QoL book so it looks proper
[2:30:08] sircrumpler: I also love having a felguard personally. Just good class fantasy
[2:30:08] the_broxton: chaos bolt crits are fun as hell tho
[2:30:17] ikerislock: Meh, destro has always been a thing though and was meta in classic. Not aff
[2:30:21] Lionkingler1: you got sleeping bag?

[2:57:28] andyjamesgames: @Steebadin the "catch up" systems have ruined retail! Blizz has made it impossible to "pick up from where you left off" in retail.

[2:57:58] Doribob1: sleepingbag

[2:59:00] portugues01: how exactly are they managing to punish "gdkp raids" ?   just curious
[2:59:07] lilkreamys: yea probably would get more from lib
[2:59:14] Icecolddonut: Good
[2:59:20] portugues01: perma bans ?
[2:59:28] deathtxne: lib better exp bc its faster

[3:29:23] chiief: so maybe it should be cities that make the rules instead since they would know more than states

[3:30:03] lagginginironforge: @Chlormann What is this "hidden tax" our food is more expensive, we have extra taxes on our gas, extra tax on our natural gas, etc

[3:30:12] deathtxne: @trekoni i'll be your valentine xoxo
[3:30:21] CarefulWithThatAxeEugene: @superglubag the issue is Biden is already comprimised and his name has power, so the CCP and other coutnries want him in power so they can control him in certain ways or influence his pea brain
[3:30:52] lagginginironforge: I'd love to move to that states for the major tax break :(
[3:30:54] Chlormann: @Chlormann that man said he has a "view tax" cuz he can see far on his mountain, your economy is less than ours so of course goods are overall more $$
[3:30:58] zezella03: Roe vs Wade was overturned in 2022 Just saying Biden was in office

[3:34:27] i_am_cakes: i think that state government should also decide if we need covid shots and it shouldnt be personal choice. we should let the government choose for us
[3:34:28] iMattbat: I guess if you die because your state doesn't allow late term abortions it's your fault for living there

[3:38:52] Sigguson: I don't agree with you. I think abortion issues should be mostly based on federal law. But I am also a law student so my opinion on how to regulate things are very biased. Although I probably have the same opinion as you about abortion and sex. I mean why are people having sex if they aren't willing to be responsible for the purpose of it? I also thing that people should be allowed to govern themselves so abortion is a very volatile subject to have opinions on...

[3:39:13] Lileas: Texas Supreme Court blocks order allowing abortion; woman who sought it leaves state. The Texas Supreme Court ruled that Kate Cox did not qualify for an abortion under the medical exception to the state's near-total abortion ban. Just hours prior, Cox's lawyers said she'd traveled out of state to have the procedure.

[3:42:34] ncd_Irsix: he was talking so much bullshit about history
[3:42:37] Sigguson: The issue is people just moving between state lines to terminate preganancies and it is gonna create legal issues most likely. But then again the purpose of sex is lost on most people and that is a bigger issue then the law itself. Laws are only made up by people, while sex is more based in nature.
[3:42:44] ncd_Irsix: with dates

[3:51:18] ZAKKH03: but that shouldnt even be a voted issue
[3:51:25] Morgrainne_Nost: Ehh. I think with like medical issues should be up to doctor's not politicians.
[3:51:26] arcantio123: still seems messed up kinda if they don't have evidence on how harmful it is for the woman, no? this is a very fringe case tho
[3:51:28] sound_wayv: i dunno "she might not die so lets keep it runnin" is a loose argument for texas
[3:51:36] person1029492: i am not and never was a part of my mothers body, your offspring is a separate human
[3:51:41] i_am_cakes: we didnt decide that as a nation. that never happened
[3:51:44] aalaavaa: legalize heroine induced baby fetal sacrifice
[3:51:48] Sesquac: thats almost like saying you need to get a vaccine
[3:51:49] sound_wayv: @person1029492 whats an umbilical cord
[3:51:56] Sesquac: its your body though
[3:51:58] ChillyHTX: fortune cookies
[3:52:01] frogchops: Covid was a lie
[3:52:05] daijahaden: Legal / Illegal there's always going to be fringe cases where things don't turn out well.
[3:52:08] lagginginironforge: They want anarchy not democracy
[3:52:08] Mattysaiyan: You vote for the guy saying they will make a vote for the things you want
[3:52:09] fuktskada: thats the gov's job?
[3:52:10] iBanEvader: catJAM
[3:52:16] dripa: if it hurts my feelings it cant be voted on end of story
[3:52:16] Lileas: it was already resolved law
[3:52:17] apollusgaming: Was it ever voted on tho? Or was it executive order?
[3:52:18] Berrd310: why do you have the rights to vote on what someone can or cant do that doesnt effect you>
[3:52:20] Pixelexip7: Yeah so because birthing a child naturally has a high death rate, the rate imposed by an additional disease and whether or not you should be able to do something with your body should be decided by the state
[3:52:21] woodgnomes: can we not get gnomish or goblin eng rn? I thought they changed it to 200eng
[3:52:31] Pixelexip7: That's asinine
[3:52:49] person1029492: @Berrd310 same reason we ban drugs and murder and rape
[3:52:52] Sharksleep: fine, then guns are resolved too
[3:52:58] cloudstrife543: ACHKHUSALLY, in the constuttuiotn, they said slavery was suppsoed to end in 1800 something
[3:53:04] Lileas: women have the right to privacy...   not the same as slave owning
[3:53:05] Shocklate_: Laws are the absolute compass for morality
[3:53:06] trekoni: KEKW damn the blue wave has arrived
[3:53:07] m00n4nds74r: @Berrd310 do you think pedophiles should be thrown in jail?
[3:53:07] xecksi: any tips for soloing on the lock in sm?
[3:53:07] ZAKKH03: but that is very subjective. And saying
[3:53:10] zezella03: I feel like the in this cases she should have been able to get the abortion T18 is very bad for both mother and baby
[3:53:10] iBanEvader: @StaysafeTV if people are actually getting more dumb means democracy will slowly evolve into idiocracy LUL
[3:53:12] madcombatkin: Theres a bunch of things that are illegal involving your body, suicide, use of drugs, going outside naked, etc.
[3:53:14] Pixelexip7: did you just put murder and rape into the same category as drugs hahaha
[3:53:22] shalomski: Basically anyone for 2nd amendment to not vote as so gun happy don't realise more danger to kids tbh
[3:53:35] fuktskada: just wait 200 more years and abortion gonna be legal in the US
[3:53:43] cloudstrife543: i dont think ti should change with the peoples sentiment
[3:53:45] sound_wayv: then they say what about the second amendment lol
[3:53:46] Pixelexip7: sorry that was someone else in the caht
[3:53:47] Synmachus: KEKW
[3:53:50] jamesxqp: whoa man you gotta chill with those coments
[3:53:53] wookinit: LUL
[3:54:01] CorruptArkangel: it’s insane to tell a woman she can’t have an abortion when it could be a life saving operation
[3:54:03] jamesxqp: gonna get staysafe permaed
[3:54:06] Lileas: you put owning slaves and women's healthcare together...
[3:54:07] jay_ray_: KEKW
[3:54:08] Shocklate_: Good evening @StaysafeTV and chat widepeepoHappy
[3:54:08] ZAKKH03: but the sentiment is that woman should have the choice. Alot of the populus wants it gone. State by state on some issues shouldnt be the caser
[3:54:10] trekoni: HotPokket DONT MAKE ME WRITE A TWITTER POST
[3:54:11] iBanEvader: @Pixelexip7 selling drugs might be worse than rape and murder
[3:54:13] nocontrast: would you allow abortion of a misformed 1 week old fetus, on the condition that the mother and father instantly try conceive again?
[3:54:16] Berrd310: @m00n4nds74r lmao those things are effecting other people dumbfucks not someone doing something with thie own bosdy
[3:54:22] shalomski: 2nd amendment was created bk when it was basic pistols etc not semi automatics
[3:54:28] superglubag: @iBanEvader youre fucking retarded
[3:54:30] bobiehd: good exp?
[3:54:35] frogchops: sstvWAT
[3:54:35] Pixelexip7: @iBanEvader "might" are you out of your mind?
[3:54:36] arcantio123: this is why i love this stream LUL
[3:54:38] iBanEvader: @superglubag no you are fucking retarded
[3:54:41] m00n4nds74r: @m00n4nds74r is a child not from inside your own body?
[3:54:43] letsgetgoingyo: @Lileas you call it "womens healthcare" but what it actually is is the killing of a child.
[3:54:47] Phalloides60: i disagree that they do. staysafe is right
[3:54:48] Sigguson: Abortion is a big can of worms. No matter how you look at it. Of course it would be better for society if sex was treated with more respect.
[3:54:50] Vespyyr: @zezella03 I agree but Texas's law is life-threatening, not health-affecting
[3:54:50] dirbagdan: Everyone already has a choice. They can choose before they have sex
[3:54:51] m00n4nds74r: @m00n4nds74r you dont have kids why do you have any say
[3:54:54] TurboBased: she has the choice to move
[3:54:55] daijahaden: The fundamental issue is if human life has value or not, and why. We have a standard that says it does. Abortion can be argued for on pragmatic grounds, but you basically can't do it without voiding that standard.
[3:55:01] iBanEvader: @Pixelexip7 drugs kill a lot more people indirectly
[3:55:02] Lileas: but they didn't vote
[3:55:09] ZAKKH03: not necessarily.
[3:55:14] yuckil: @nocontrast pretty soon there will be mandatory seminal injections SCHIZO
[3:55:27] shalomski: I vote for Americans to actually see world news and not American lol
[3:55:34] gary_ontwitch: ur both wrong on that actually, the issues that are left to the states are not up for discussion, its laid out direclty in the constitution
[3:55:37] lagginginironforge: Not every decision needs to be voted on. We would get nothing done otherwise.
[3:55:39] trekoni: BASEDRETARD
[3:55:45] CatmanGhost: It's supposed to be a constitutional republic. Democracy is not something the founding fathers wanted.
[3:55:46] Lileas: on a state level, people didn't vote to disallow abortion
[3:55:50] Berrd310: @m00n4nds74r you are real bad at making arguments
[3:55:50] ZAKKH03: but the popular votes can lose the elections.
[3:55:57] ZAKKH03: elecotral college is how they get put in office
[3:56:01] Signa_arize: @StaysafeTV  what are we farming?
[3:56:03] TurboBased: jesus lol
[3:56:04] Lileas: popular vote is democracy
[3:56:05] delirious555: Abortion rights have won every time it has come up for vote.
[3:56:06] fuktskada: why not let all the us women vote for it?
[3:56:11] nevynevs: !pvp
[3:56:12] lagginginironforge: Imagine every law had to have mailout ballets and setup voting stations
[3:56:13] Lileas: no
[3:56:14] 13deadace1: I AM the Senate
[3:56:15] Lileas: nope
[3:56:18] m00n4nds74r: @m00n4nds74r im not bad at making arguments youre bad at having your opinions challenged at a fundamental level
[3:56:19] TurboBased: vote for your representatives
[3:56:22] i_am_cakes: Now we can, but it was decided for us from the start which is wrong.
[3:56:25] Lileas: alabama didn't have a public vote
[3:56:25] ZAKKH03: Donald trump has never won the popular vote.
[3:56:26] m00n4nds74r: @m00n4nds74r lurk more idiot
[3:56:31] Synmachus: What is it that they don't get KEKW
[3:56:32] wookinit: people live under a rock
[3:56:38] helmetnach0s: I will say, voting has become more about voting against someone you hate rather that someone you like. which is an issue in and of itself
[3:56:42] shalomski: I don't care what ppl choose,  aslong as religion not brought into it, its 2024 lol
[3:56:42] apollusgaming: Google Texas abortion vote :/
[3:56:43] ZAKKH03: and still got elected
[3:56:46] TurboBased: the people voted for the representatives to enact their will
[3:56:47] dtl78: yeah i havent seen a general public vote on any of that stuff, curious
[3:56:49] Volpick: No this is Patrick
[3:56:49] i_am_cakes: @ZAKKH03 big true
[3:56:51] superglubag: @iBanEvader drugs kill alot more people than murder? thats interesting
[3:56:51] WhineGodTV: @Lileas but elected representatives made the choice
[3:57:04] Berrd310: @m00n4nds74r how is that funadmental? lmao you literally tried to argue rape and pedophilia was the same as abortion saying it effected other people when it doesnt
[3:57:09] aalaavaa: God bless you for interacting with all of these midwits
[3:57:10] Yavi11: Yavi11 subscribed at Tier 3. They've subscribed for 6 months! Electoral college lul
[3:57:12] dirbagdan: its about royal bloodlines
[3:57:15] Slesky: I think we should dissolve the US military and have each state fund it's own armed forces. Then do away with Federal taxes completely
[3:57:16] lagginginironforge: @ZAKKH03 Theres a reason electoral colleges exist
[3:57:20] shalomski: Imagine making votes of an imaginary sky daddy 🤣
[3:57:26] m00n4nds74r: @m00n4nds74r i never said rape i said pedophilia, youre putting words in my mouth
[3:57:32] whywork20: im late whats the big news :D
[3:57:33] Jay_rb: But you could play checkers on a chess board xdd
[3:57:35] Pixelexip7: @iBanEvader Oh you mean the opioid/ fenth crisis, something that was created by corporate greed and China. Have you done any research yourself on what drugs are responsible for death rates?
[3:57:46] Lileas: there was no popular vote in alabama on abortion
[3:57:59] Synmachus: @Lileas Elected representatives make the choice. People vote for said representatives. Literally western democracy 101
[3:57:59] nevynevs: !spec
[3:57:59] Nightbot: MY SOLO DUNGEON SPEC: https://www.wowhead.com/classic/talent-calc/warlock/5500253002201005
[3:58:05] Mattysaiyan: Popular vote would be better though, regardless of who wins
[3:58:14] ZAKKH03: Of course
[3:58:15] obstata: @Mattysaiyan you couldnt be more wrong
[3:58:17] Sharksleep: also, new york and california would always determine the president. fuck that.
[3:58:23] fuktskada: well, whats your take on it?
[3:58:23] Pixelexip7: nobody campaigns in non-swing states
[3:58:26] TurboBased: people are just ignorant
[3:58:29] HeIlraiser_: glad im not american, its so complicated lol
[3:58:34] lagginginironforge: @Mattysaiyan No it wouldnt. The major cities would pick the president and the rural people would never be represented ever again.
[3:58:34] madcombatkin: No one wants to be controlled be 2 states with the most population lol
[3:58:42] Tomoglaziat: Trump came to central cali but we r conservative
[3:58:43] ZAKKH03: I get that. But he can influence change based on his parties values but not the popular majority
[3:58:48] nocontrast: it's just a statement that most people didn't want him
[3:58:56] ZAKKH03: or not "he" but anyone who gets voted in
[3:58:57] letsgetgoingyo: @Mattysaiyan no, it wouid mean 4-5 big states would dictate the president every time and the other ~45 states would get essentially no say
[3:58:57] Pixelexip7: that wouldnt change the populist voter sentiment.
[3:59:00] iBanEvader: @Pixelexip7 i'm talking about all drugs no the fucking pioid/fenth blablabla unproven conspiracy bullshit you think might be true. Even fucking alcohol kills more people than all murders
[3:59:01] theSalute: unts unts unts
[3:59:01] helmetnach0s: is thorns not worth having?
[3:59:01] Jay_rb: Cali, Texas, NY would dominate campaigning if Popular vote mattered
[3:59:04] m00n4nds74r: @m00n4nds74r someone being sexually attracted to children dosent affect anyone other than the individual feeling those feelings right? so it should be allowed by your logic right?
[3:59:05] shalomski: If ppl weren't retarded and didn't listen to media,  you know trump wins via votes even none Americans
[3:59:15] ZAKKH03: @Jay_rb where the most peopel are
[3:59:20] daijahaden: @lileas I don't get that point. Under US law a fetus is a human life. Ending a human life is murder. If you want an exemption to that for abortion then you need a positive right "you are allowed to do this". There probably no wish to enact that exemption in Alabama, so why would they vote on it?
[3:59:24] iBanEvader: @Pixelexip7 you are being a debate andy
[3:59:36] m00n4nds74r: @m00n4nds74r this is what im talking about, youre not reading what im actually saying and your losing the argument at a fundamental level
[3:59:38] Pixelexip7: @iBanEvader because youre talking out of your ass
[3:59:45] m00n4nds74r: @m00n4nds74r again, lurk more, idiot
[3:59:45] damroyalty: has anybody used the necrosis add on for warlocks? is it useful?
[3:59:50] iBanEvader: @Pixelexip7 and i'm not saying murder or rape are good, i'm just saying drugs might be considered worse than those
[3:59:59] iBanEvader: @Pixelexip7 imbecile
[4:00:01] Phalloides60: dam dude. some people are legit dumb... Sadge
[4:00:13] damroyalty: noted. thank you bro
[4:00:16] Sigguson: It is fun to listen to you put down a idiot. Somethings are about opinions but winning the popular vote doesn't matter in US presidental election.
[4:00:17] cafrozed: did you see that OpenAI text to video model Sora?
[4:00:17] Switzout: Never heard of it
[4:00:20] iBanEvader: @Pixelexip7 you motherfucking imbecile
[4:00:20] Jay_rb: If it was dictated by popular vote Campaigns would be more like Music Tours KEKW
[4:00:26] cafrozed: omg
[4:00:30] cafrozed: how does this man not know
[4:00:32] shalomski: Everyone I know as none american thinks Biden is not mentally capable of presidency lol
[4:00:33] Berrd310: @m00n4nds74r lmao you still talking? pedopilia does effect people other than the person
[4:00:33] aalaavaa: Taught what to think, but not how to think,  not that it would matter much with the midwit tier IQ
[4:00:36] TurboBased: that Sora shit looks insane actually
[4:00:44] cafrozed: ^ This
[4:00:46] Berrd310: @Berrd310 cant fix stupid
[4:00:46] Ackvuul: Is there a way to see his spec?
[4:00:50] m00n4nds74r: @m00n4nds74r then you dont even understand the definition, youre literally retarded
[4:00:54] iBanEvader: @superglubag indirectly yes
[4:00:54] cafrozed: if you want to blow your dick off check out openai sora staysafe
[4:00:56] spleen_eater: Should it matter?
[4:00:59] ZAKKH03: 100%
[4:01:04] cafrozed: history was made today
[4:01:06] trekoni: BASEDRETARD i graduated with a liberal arts degree from Cal Berkeley
[4:01:12] Plathyy: man world of warcraft is a really fun game
[4:01:16] ZAKKH03: But i see that somewhat as an issue. But youre right it really doesnt matter
[4:01:31] HeIlraiser_: polukarity contest, shit all we wanted in the 90s was for everybody to be equal
[4:01:32] rageraleks: whats ur build again?
[4:01:33] obstata: @Plathyy source?
[4:01:40] Pixelexip7: @iBanEvader Wow so this is what it's like talking to people who have 2 brain cells
[4:01:40] QuestFor420: boost my warrior ill give you 69 gold
[4:01:45] bigdiesel900: "mentioning it doesn't matter" would you have that stance if trump won a popular vote in an election he lost
[4:01:47] Yavi11: As a canadian I am surprised voters even let teh electoral college continue, it's so rigged, especially with jerrymanding
[4:01:50] GodKingMuninn: popular vote versus electoral college both have their positives and benefits.
[4:01:54] rageraleks: doesnt work in the states @StaysafeTV
[4:01:54] Lileas: @daijahaden  Because healthcare isn't absolute, and the government should not be involved in healthcare. Casual abortion is a problem, but it's not the government's job to dictate healthcare. It's between the dr and the patient..
[4:01:54] Bronloch: The Founding Fathers knew that the popular vote could be manipulated with propaganda so they made the Electoral College to prevent that so we dont end up with President Taylor Swift or President Elvis! LUL
[4:02:01] person1029492: the culture of the cities would take over the whole country
[4:02:10] lickmypetals: A popular vote election in todays day and age would be awful look at how the country stands atm
[4:02:10] seymourmoney: So...a republic...which we have....
[4:02:12] dtl78: just get rid of federal government as its useless
[4:02:16] TurboBased: BASED
[4:02:21] ZAKKH03: voter ID 100%
[4:02:21] xKingLev: Aptitude test 100%
[4:02:23] letsgetgoingyo: raies voting age to 25
[4:02:27] ZAKKH03: aptitude no way
[4:02:28] lagginginironforge: I cant believe it isn't already
[4:02:28] nocontrast: STARSHIP TROOPERS STYLE
[4:02:30] TurboBased: you have people viting for a free donut
[4:02:36] rageraleks: @StaysafeTV you woulda hve states like california deciding the election for the entire country
[4:02:40] thehorrorblygreatshow: Maybe politicians should start telling us why we should vote for them rather than telling us why we shouldn't vote for the other guy.
[4:02:41] Mattysaiyan: @letsgetgoingyo would you lower the max voting age too?
[4:02:43] lickmypetals: voting age to 25 - IQ test - voter ID - no votes from dead people
[4:02:48] photek_tn: @Lileas wtf is casual about killing children?
[4:02:53] wramel: how about a limit on campaign funding
[4:02:56] hearthledgerlol: Vote only in person only on paper with multiple validators.  Mimimum of high school degree / GED to vote. That would solve 99% of the problems.
[4:02:56] Echo5Brav0: Aptitude test knocks out 90% of voters
[4:03:01] GordyW: True
[4:03:01] Yavi11: @xKingLev only 10% of americans would pass the test lul
[4:03:02] TheseDaysLIVE: cant regulate idiotic voters
[4:03:04] lagginginironforge: Well educated vs real world smart are very different too
[4:03:09] wangchung2nyte: who came and pooped?
[4:03:11] ZAKKH03: @Echo5Brav0 exactly
[4:03:13] trekoni: BASED 🔫 BASEDRETARD
[4:03:14] letsgetgoingyo: @Mattysaiyan no
[4:03:16] hxzcc: do you think that everyone should vote?
[4:03:24] ZAKKH03: @hxzcc everyone cant vote
[4:03:26] HeIlraiser_: dumb people to learn but I guess when you dont provide education that dont happen
[4:03:29] cloudstrife543: sometimes societies have to destroy themselves, theres no perfect system, i think we are at the destroy ourselves part
[4:03:32] lagginginironforge: A lot of academics with PhDs havent looked anything besides a math textbook for 15+ years
[4:03:38] wookinit: land owners only
[4:03:41] mohihe3834: 1 dollar = 1 vote
[4:03:43] Robbtuck: how about term limits for everyone. so many lifelong politicians who don’t do shit
[4:03:47] fuktskada: but a popular vote in that legit demographic though?
[4:03:49] ZAKKH03: 100%
[4:03:52] bradm_6: assuming voting block is currently split 50/50, what do you think new split would be under your desired voting criteria?
[4:03:53] lagginginironforge: @wookinit this tbh
[4:03:54] Kenziepuff: Democracy is g*y
[4:03:57] thehorrorblygreatshow: Dumb people own guns. We should crack down on that shit too lol
[4:04:01] samsp00: democracy only works if the majority populace are actually extremely intelligent, which is a pipedream - we dont live in a democracy at all, purely illusion
[4:04:02] revora_: I'm voting for Trump from Australia EZ
[4:04:05] iBanEvader: holy shit the people in chat
[4:04:07] dtl78: taylor swift is gonna let me know who to vote for everything else is irrelevant anyway
[4:04:08] carlosantonioar: is there a fast way to farm arathi basin rep or just spam AB?
[4:04:13] TheseDaysLIVE: Women vote only
[4:04:14] Robbtuck: @thehorrorblygreatshow actually dumb people don’t own guns
[4:04:15] cloudstrife543: uneducated 25 yos should not vote
[4:04:20] realmalfurionsr: @Kenziepuff democracy is not g*y wtf
[4:04:24] ZAKKH03: we cant chat unless we FOLLOW XD
[4:04:26] FIip_: But voter ID, and aptitude test would just target impoverished population disproportionately.  I think something basic like making Elections holidays so you get the day off paid so you have incentive to go vote.  Voter turnout is an aspect that we need to tackle before adding more barriers to voting.
[4:04:35] wtspotions: referring to democracy in such a generalized way is shortsighted - we have representative democracy. this is completely different than a direct democracy where votes are treated equally
[4:04:35] TurboBased: Follow! let your voice be heard!
[4:04:36] thehorrorblygreatshow: @robbtuck you know everyone that owns guns I guess
[4:04:45] lagginginironforge: What about all the people who don't follow politics? They should vote if they have zero knowledge of the world around them?
[4:04:56] Mattysaiyan: @letsgetgoingyo Not necessarily disagreeing but curious as to why you think a 24yo has less rights than a lets say 85yo as to the future of the country
[4:04:56] TheseDaysLIVE: @lagginginironforge cant regulate that
[4:05:08] cloudstrife543: @FIip_ what does voter id and impovershed have to do with election holidays
[4:05:08] Kenziepuff: @realmalfurionsr 9/10 people involved in a g*ngr*pe voted to be there. that’s democracy.
[4:05:25] wtspotions: im just pointing out that democracy isnt a blanket term its a form of it
[4:05:27] daijahaden: @lileas But it sort of is. There is a baseline of laws/norms that the healthcare system needs to abide by. And universally legalizing abortion for all states, would be just that. The government dictating healthcare.
[4:05:27] wtspotions: yeah we agree
[4:05:34] samsp00: voting is theatrical play to give people the illusion of choice
[4:05:35] fuktskada: no
[4:05:36] letsgetgoingyo: @FIip_ but we want less people voting, not more. You dont want every idiot voting, cause it dilutes all the well informed votes
[4:05:49] thehorrorblygreatshow: Democratic Republic
[4:05:50] lagginginironforge: @TheseDaysLIVE Yeah ofc, but an IQ test wouldn't be realistic either

[4:06:05] FIip_: @cloudstrife543 He was saying there should be voter ID and aptitude tests. I was saying we shouldn't add more barriers to voting. Voter turn out is already very low we should instead implement things that increase voter turnout such as holidays for big elections

[4:07:37] Yavi11: Let's be honest, the US is so far from a democracy it may as well be a dictatorship, capitalism is just a nice way to it
[4:07:38] obstata: 1 person kept saying no *
[4:07:42] lagginginironforge: We can discuss how 5iq libertarian absolutists are?
[4:07:45] realmalfurionsr: the people vote to have policy enacted and changed
[4:07:48] realmalfurionsr: not politicians
[4:07:54] FIip_: There's a crazy statistic that I would need to confirm but only 50% of the US population is eligible to vote and then only 50% of that actually go out an vote. Ussually older people tend to go vote more than younger.   Were literally letting old fucking croaks vote for everything and thats how we end up with 2 fucking dinosaurs running for president FOR A 2ND TIME
[4:07:54] Vespyyr: quinDRUGSKICKEDIN

[4:08:29] TheWhiteRabbitxX: @fiip_ bro are you like 13? it’s always old people running for president. lol
[4:08:56] lagginginironforge: @FIip_ A closer break down would be men vs women.
[4:08:56] Mattysaiyan: @Mauraderss FPTP is one of the worst things ever in politics for sure
[4:09:03] Yavi11: I agree with that, but the problem is most politicians are morons @StaysafeTV
[4:09:12] GodKingMuninn: Its like when players think they know more than the game dev.
[4:09:17] lagginginironforge: Exactly
[4:09:20] wangchung2nyte: Should politicians be able to be lifetime politicians?
[4:09:21] fuktskada: heh you dont have a clue of what you talking about <3
[4:09:29] FIip_: @TheWhiteRabbitxX "The median age at inauguration of incoming U.S. presidents is 55 years." Trump is 77 and Biden is 81. What the fuck are you talking about?
[4:09:30] Jay_rb: Senators and Congressman should be kicked out when they hit 65, no more of these lifer politicians in their 80s making decisions for 25 year olds.

[4:12:11] trump2024_yep: OF COURSE
[4:12:13] dirbagdan: i.e, Canada
[4:12:18] trekoni: BASEDRETARD i just owned a trumptard
[4:12:23] Yavi11: @letsgetgoingyo This is EXACTLY why the voting age is lower though, cause just cause you think this, others don't, that's the point of voting in the first place.  Many people wuld prefer no one over 55 could be a politician, works both ways
[4:12:28] Kenziepuff: Monarchy is preferable to democracy in every way because it at least recognizes the inherent inequality in people.
[4:12:31] daijahaden: @plathyy The grindy mindnumbing boredom of playing classic wow is turning your husband into a political pundit. Get him to play GTA or something else before he starts running for congress.

[4:13:39] letsgetgoingyo: @Yavi11 if you look at demographic voting trends its pretty obvious that the younger the people who vote, the dumber the candidate. So if you want the USA to die, then we should definitely lower the voting age.
[4:13:44] ceth3rnaut: AMERICA NUMBER !
[4:13:45] lagginginironforge: Only tall people should be allowed to vote

[4:14:52] 13deadace1: I'm 6foot 5

[4:15:48] Yavi11: @lagginginironforge Something tells me you don't know how Trudeu stays in power, because if no one wanted him there as you say, he wouldn't be there.  He's there because the MAJORITY of people want him there... hence voting.
[4:15:52] rich5lut: hermies

NDP only have 25 seats, so they chose to back liberals to get some of their agenda brought to life, this is normal and has always happened in canada.  There is no "NDP keeping him in power"

[5:44:22] KCYON: it would be wise to gather all docs you've shared with this guy too
[5:44:38] Totalko: I wouldnt know for you. Here you would send a registered letter informing the person about the deal made, and refer to the communication. Include a deadline to which he is able to conclude the deal or to return the money. After which they would be 'in default'. If the guy owns stuff, i would put chances very high to get back your money, if its a druggy i would put chance at 0. But rules and regulation and ways to proach these things are different all around the world.
