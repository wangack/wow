[0:42:55] TotallyNotRaien: without knowing youve been doing girl math all your life naguura
[0:42:56] InsidiousRay: "Girl math" is a social media joke that originated with TikToker Samantha Jane. It's a lighthearted way of describing the creative and non-traditional calculations women use to justify their spending habits.

[1:03:02] Sebleh: I will take one too please. you can just give me the same one as @kahlandra I’ll cross out the name.
[1:03:08] TotallyNotRaien: add "like everyone else"
[1:03:26] Sebleh: yes say the comp because you’re talking about the dungeon in a bubble, not really in context of the whole competition weekend
[1:03:36] Xendera5: ask ChatGPT for mdi season 3 and drink some cups of coffee 😂
[1:04:29] JohnnyOneLung: after you do this, can you TRY a chatGPT version just to see what it comes up with?
[1:04:36] Sebleh: she used chatgtp and he forgot who she was from one day to the next. ChatGPT is not a good friend Smadge
[1:04:38] JohnnyOneLung: just for meemes
[1:04:54] Zirconn__: and accidentally submit it naguuraSip
[1:05:16] Sebleh: do you really need to separate the comp into one sentence per role? I think you can just say it all in one go no? naguuraSip
[1:05:20] Sebleh: it’s two words
[1:05:23] Sebleh: Demon Hunter
[1:05:23] Spiritakk: The workflow can work the otherway around aswell. Write a brief script and points like you do here and then give it to ChatGPT to tidy it up.

[1:08:38] JohnnyOneLung: of course she doesn't have a cast! They stopped it from ever happening (with precision and teamwork)
[1:08:52] Spiritakk: I swear if you write the script yourself with the points you wanna mention and you give it to ChatGpt to smooth it out and  to play with it a bit its gonna build on it and come up with a banger!
[1:09:12] plirbo: The scary part with AI is how it can sound so good and confident and still be so wrong.
[1:09:13] Zirconn__: but to wow players, this is the  equivalent of trying to hit the word count on a school paper by adding nonsensical bullshit KEKW
[1:09:36] Niuxe: @plirbo I've worked with people like that.
[1:09:38] TotallyNotRaien: i think the forgot to add Teamwork

[1:22:39] TotallyNotRaien: man i shouldve paid attention in school cuz i cant write for shit
[1:22:52] Sebleh: could make it an overview of their route. “Their route consists of 6 pulls in total, with only 2 of them not including a boss.”
[1:23:04] NymphaDr00d: Could you explain the structure of their pulls in one statement then make reference to that

[1:28:05] TotallyNotRaien: making sure
[1:28:27] Sebleh: assuming you’re trying to say they won’t get hit by the charges, I think ensuring might be good.
[1:28:37] Wrathbb1: @Sebleh true. I would lean towards "enabling gameplay options/safe positioning" if thats what its about
[1:28:54] Sebleh: seblehHmm
[1:28:58] Wrathbb1: enabling stacking mobs is how iw ould say taht

[2:11:43] Kuroz: it's not a guide
[2:11:52] Xpuzzels: maybe the cc immunty when the confessor get not interrupted ?

[2:15:23] alexz_gegee: thank you at least somebody agrreeess ^^
[2:15:25] Sebleh: there’s no need to. the only thing they changed was the jumps in Azure Vaults
[2:15:31] Kim_Wu: dont put words in my mouth i like them
[2:15:31] Sebleh: @goosecomics they said the base 8 dungeons only
[2:16:04] everjaz: i like that its streamlined tho
[2:16:14] alexz_gegee: yes but they use details omnicd on the stream, they could just use another addon thats just a little bit more visual

[2:16:58] alexz_gegee: sure true
[2:17:03] Sebleh: you also just have a vastly different UI as a player than the MDI observers do. their UI covers like 1/3 of the screen for visibility purposes

[2:19:33] Sebleh: what were the affixes for the first week’s AD? they did it a minute faster with a healer than the 4 dps comps on tyrannical a week before.
[2:20:24] pax_rush: Bursting is the affix itself i think, burst is the debuff
[2:20:36] Sebleh: the affix has always been called bursting
[2:20:36] cptdrage: when they changed time on it i think
[2:20:39] GooseComics: Affix is called bursting, but the debuff is Burst yeha
[2:20:51] Tephaine: that would be to easy
[2:20:57] chiva845: anyone knows what's the Plater mod to make plates change color when debuffed?
[2:21:05] Sebleh: because the affix is an action. Entangling, Thundering, etc. the mob is doing the bursting and puts burst on you
[2:21:14] GooseComics: You should look at the Hearthstone text of similar effects, but completly random wording. Blizzard logic
[2:21:22] pax_rush: probably cuz its concise
[2:21:41] pax_rush: shorter*
[2:23:06] CrerisRs: isnt there a set of feathers circling him close to the ground?

[3:20:54] Kuroz: it's the meeix propaganda about one dungeon vs echo that echo messed up Kappa
[3:20:56] Sebleh: I don’t think top 4 but they played pretty poorly I think.
[3:21:08] Kuroz: CatDriving
[3:21:13] Sebleh: they cooked sick strats a few times and played like top 6 style
[3:21:22] Raggu2: I didnt know until yesterday that Augers only cast spells if a Juggernaut is nearby.
[3:21:39] Sebleh: but this time top 8 looked generous. not to be rude about them either they just didn’t seem on par this time.
[3:22:20] Sebleh: yes they announced they retired from MDI

[3:22:59] Anelit21: its like a twilight zone
[3:23:31] Sebleh: also sloth’s performance was best during the seasonal dungeons - when they got multiple seasons of practice on each dungeon. maybe the dungeon rotations is what hurt their performance.

[3:28:25] Kuroz: naguuraLove naguuraLove naguuraLove
[3:28:39] Raggu2: Just hiding the specific affixes would go a long way
[3:28:47] Dukkemanden: is this the new "running aimlessly around Dalaran" ?
[3:28:54] StreamElements: Join Naguura on her journey to become the most casual of transmog farmers! Goth Naguura AKA “Nagothica” has been challenged to farm a goth transmog for her character and will be wearing a goth transmog IRL to match! Guidelines are posted in the #Nagothica channel of Naguura’s Discord. Date TBD.
[3:28:59] Sebleh: fwiw speed running in any other game is also scripted as hell.
[3:29:41] okdamaja: why are speedrun raids not a thing in retail, surely the top guilds 1-shot most bosses in a timely fashion in their splits?
[3:29:52] AceReformed: If i can be a huge nerd, MDI is not speedrunning but racing Nerdge
[3:30:30] cptdrage: they had speedrun raid back in firelands
[3:30:38] Avengedhonor: the raid and has also been done before
[3:30:42] JohnnyOneLung: You know what would be fun?  A blind run competition to promote the new dungeons in the new xpac.  Not seriously competitive but we get to see the really top guys completely improvise
[3:30:43] alexz_gegee: naguura do you know why they were able to create 11/12 dungeons in legion but now we get 8 dungeons we are able to play 4 of them then the other 4 and then you get the megadungeon with 6 old baked dungeons i played million times
[3:30:55] Sebleh: @johnnyonelung like they did at blizzcon? KEKW
[3:31:09] alexz_gegee: why cant they create new stuff like in legion basically i dont know
[3:31:27] JohnnyOneLung: clearly she hates this idea
[3:31:48] Evrid: @alexz_gegee  that argument holds no water cause we had the same dungeons all expac apart from the new ones
[3:31:52] Raggu2: @alexz_gegee That takes resources. i dont know if you've seen but Blizzard has been losing people constantly over the past years.
[3:31:55] Sebleh: because you typed it in chat. she legally cannot like something typed in chat @johnnyonelung
[3:32:13] Sebleh: it’s in her streamer contract: “if chat suggests something, tell them why their idea is stupid”
[3:32:29] TotallyNotRaien: *especially sebleh
[3:33:00] JohnnyOneLung: one day event, online, everyone can stream to their own channel.  I have marketing brain on not gamer brain
[3:33:17] xArcesius: didn't they do an Uldaman preview?
[3:33:26] alexz_gegee: @Raggu2 blizzard is still a multimillion dollar company. I dont think that they dont have the recourses for it. do you really like playing old dungeons from cataclysm?
[3:33:57] JohnnyOneLung: how dare you
[3:34:05] JohnnyOneLung: you're meant to blindly agree to me, it's in our contract
[3:35:05] cptdrage: its 10 dungeons in dragonflight
[3:35:17] cptdrage: just 8 in m+
[3:35:24] Sebleh: we only had more than 10 dungeons in legion and vanilla-wrath
[3:35:24] chasechristiannikole1023: Hey naguura I've been watching ur videos since draenar and I love them all
[3:35:31] JohnnyOneLung: oh I have a good question.  Of the remaining "old dungeons that were never M+" what ones would you prefer.  What do you think is going to be picked?
[3:35:38] daconcion: I vote we get deadmines next season
[3:35:48] Sebleh: for reasons I checked and most expacs have 10 or less dungeons
[3:35:50] Raggu2: @JohnnyOneLung Ubrs rework
[3:36:06] hellbringer1997: gets old quick
[3:36:15] JohnnyOneLung: I really like what they've done.  A criticism levied against WoW is they throw out all their fun content every 2-3 years.
[3:36:26] JohnnyOneLung: this way we can revisit fun things
[3:36:26] alexz_gegee: @Evrid yes i understand that. but in legion we got a new dungeon with every patch.. they "could" add old dungeons plus create the new ones.. but it feels bad for me at least playing cata dungeons . i dont know.
[3:36:27] hellbringer1997: 4 seassons of shrine of the storm
[3:36:30] vroh_: @Naguura do you think next season will be all DF dungeons?
[3:36:35] Raggu2: Wow has so much content that im sure cost a lot to make that just sits rotting.
[3:36:46] whup_nz: 13 dungeons in Legion, that was crazy
[3:36:54] Kuroz: kara as megadungeon, cathedral and seat
[3:36:57] alexz_gegee: with every major notr minor
[3:37:02] Sebleh: we did
[3:37:09] Sebleh: no
[3:37:11] gamor12: we did this every majer pach
[3:37:16] Raggu2: The nightborn place opened up later as well yea
[3:37:16] Sebleh: archway and fourth werent in 7.0
[3:37:17] JohnnyOneLung: and if you were in a high end guild you got Maw of Souls PTSD
[3:37:18] Raggu2: After launch
[3:37:22] Sebleh: wow okay let me try again
[3:37:30] Sebleh: arcway and court were not in 7.0
[3:37:36] iridae: We got kara in 7.1, catherdral 7.2 and stea 7.3
[3:37:42] Sebleh: because suramar was not in 7.0 no?
[3:38:01] whup_nz: And kara became upper and lower, so it was 4 extra dungeons to the M+ pool in Legion
[3:38:16] Raggu2: Rip eye of command
[3:38:32] xArcesius: do you think we will get a shadowlands dungeon back soon?
[3:38:53] hellbringer1997: throne is bassicly new
[3:38:56] Raggu2: @xArcesius I hope not, cause itll be mists, and im done with mists.
[3:38:59] alexz_gegee: of course the system is better then playing 10 same in whole 2 years.. but i just hoped they could create new stuff more :D but it is an opinion thing of course
[3:39:00] XeroeTV: sbg was definetly a little too easy, but wasnt that their first patch brining them back?
[3:39:09] JohnnyOneLung: agree
[3:39:12] chasechristiannikole1023: Hey naguura I messaged u on Instagram
[3:39:19] Sebleh: I still 10 dungeons per season would be nice for variety but I get why it’s not a thing
[3:39:20] Kuroz: HUH
[3:39:36] Sebleh: naguuraSip
[3:39:37] JohnnyOneLung: lmao
[3:39:40] Kuroz: he follows you from draenar and he has a question
[3:39:40] daconcion: It's very important
[3:39:43] Raggu2: you should, that sound slike content
[3:39:45] TotallyNotRaien: show the class!
[3:39:45] daconcion: Probably a cat pic
[3:39:48] sylvija_96: We wanna know now :)
[3:39:54] chasechristiannikole1023: Nothing wrong with the message just asking a question
[3:39:55] Kuroz: hmmMeeting
[3:40:05] TinySp00k: Maybe it is the best thing you have ever read...
[3:40:15] Sebleh: Hey naguura I messaged you Instagram, Twitter, discord, twitch, emailed, and I snail mailed you to your business address.
[3:40:32] JohnnyOneLung: is the question "hey bb are you single?"
[3:40:32] guzy44: KEKW
[3:40:34] TotallyNotRaien: look out the window they are sending you smoke signals too
[3:40:47] Raggu2: I messaged Naguurchair on Insta and got no response.
[3:40:53] boyzbee: Why does mdi not have class bans
[3:40:59] JohnnyOneLung: what type of tea/
[3:41:14] Sebleh: wow tea and not coffee? wowowow
[3:41:28] TotallyNotRaien: so is that like a 3/3 on chats ideas being stupid to her?
[3:41:32] Sebleh: bro mdi chat was wild about how “easy” it would be to adapt to class bans
[3:41:32] whup_nz: South African tea D:
[3:41:36] Sebleh: so stupid
[3:41:44] Kuroz: you're almost done
[3:41:48] Kuroz: 3 more pulls Kappa
[3:41:51] reggiepowa: !ui
[3:41:52] StreamElements: My UI and all Weakauras are available  for subs  on my discord server in the subscriber-area. Make sure you connect your discord to your twitch account to access it -> https://discord.gg/naguura
[3:41:58] tykus21: what the hell is that in the top left corner
[3:41:59] JohnnyOneLung: class bans only mean doubling (or more) the prep time really.. all it tells the players "Hey try your best with the meta comps... and then again with slightly different comps"
[3:42:05] daconcion: Every team gets 5 class bans
[3:42:08] daconcion: ban the entire roster
[3:42:14] alexz_gegee: just because it would be more fun to watch i guess but without a lot sense
[3:42:18] TotallyNotRaien: they should ask themselves how many classes they have ready to play at master level as back up
[3:42:45] whup_nz: I understand the motivation, and looking at things like the draft in Mobas
[3:43:02] TinySp00k: Which dungeons would you choose for season 4?
[3:43:19] boyzbee: It would more fun for the teams if you could only ban one class per series
[3:43:31] Sebleh: @johnnyonelung that’s what I kept saying along with every global being pretty much planned and everyone’s just like “oh but they’re top players they can adapt!”
[3:43:46] JohnnyOneLung: before the competition qualifications, the specs are all ranked (we will steal Dratnos's tier list) and time bonuses are assigned to off-meta while time penalities are given to super-meta ones LUL
[3:43:52] daconcion: I don't think it would be more fun, the teams devise their strategies based on the comp they can play. Changing that ruins the best strats, so you get weaker strats which are less fun to watch
[3:43:57] JohnnyOneLung: ^there, I've come up with an equally bad idea
[3:44:00] TotallyNotRaien: mobas have 4 spells
[3:44:26] boyzbee: Get good lol
[3:44:34] whup_nz: I'm not comparing mobas and I agree with you Naguura lol
[3:44:51] Sebleh: you should make a TikTok about why class bans wouldn’t work
[3:45:05] gamor12: @Naguura what if the know the class bans a week before so every team need to show class bans before turnement start ?
[3:45:06] Sebleh: so I can just fucking link it when some idiot goes off about ThE sAmE cOmP aGaIn
[3:45:06] StreamElements: Hello Sebleh worryAss
[3:45:14] NexyTrox: I don't think people also understand the amount of prep time MDI players already put in versus the amount of pay they get. If they had to practice MDI level pulls on 3 or 4 classes EACH player, then they would be putting in so much more time that MDI wouldn't be worth to participate in.
[3:45:17] JohnnyOneLung: maybe your tiktok should turn into rants so you can redirect people from twitch chat there LUL
[3:45:29] sylvija_96: you don't put limitations on speedruns
[3:45:33] sylvija_96: that changes the category
[3:45:46] sim967: @johnnyonelung on to something there
[3:45:49] Kahlandra: just do a pick and ban its easy i know i only play one class but surely these guys can practive at least 5 at a super high competitive level iTs NoT haRd
[3:46:17] tylerg2018: Hey America, go play football, but quarterbacks are banned
[3:46:21] Kahlandra: NICE STRAWMAN THEORY (actually saw someone say that)
[3:46:23] TinySp00k: Sounds good tho Kappa
[3:46:24] GrinAndHavoc: Hey, I love watching baseball, but let's ban the catcher position, the pitcher now has to pitch the ball and run and get it if it's not hit! Yeah, that'll work!
[3:46:42] GeeTV: Sounds awful unsafe
[3:46:44] gamor12: i think some off the bad teams like that :D like hash :D and the might get a red bull :D
[3:46:45] JohnnyOneLung: "The BEST driver would be able to adapt" 4Head
[3:46:48] Sebleh: @nexytrox they don’t understand. that’s the problem. “it’s just running low keys”
[3:46:53] iiyat: give every competitor the redbull
[3:46:55] tykus21: The real question is why dont they recruit more short people to play basketball.
[3:47:38] StreamElements: If you enjoy the stream make sure to check naguura out on her Socials : https://twitter.com/Naguura // https://www.youtube.com/naguura // https://www.instagram.com/naguura // tiktok.com/@naguura
[3:47:40] JohnnyOneLung: I think people want to see two things: a fair measure of who the best players are and comp diversity... but the game itself kinda naturally sets those concepts against eachother
[3:48:05] sim967: I have an idea!  have captains of m+ teams draft the other 4 players a month before MDI
[3:48:14] JohnnyOneLung: I will say that generally speaking WoW Esports are doing a pretty okay job at improving format each iteration
[3:48:53] Sebleh: it’s just more reasons why tgp is better. you actually get to see the prog
[3:49:00] i_Luccas: Moin Caro, Chat
[3:49:43] elysium_cy: Good day everyone hf in game
[3:50:24] daconcion: @Naguura People wiped to Mythic Fyrakk? Thought it got one-shot
[3:50:40] NexyTrox: Yeah thats true, unless you push high end keys, or attempt to participate in the MDI time trials, everything looks super easy. TGP definitely shows the progression more and is easier to understand for your average player
[3:50:40] Andersonmps: Ppl would think the same of RWF if only the kill was showed
[3:50:48] JohnnyOneLung: wouldn't take too long hehehehe gottem
[3:50:48] Sebleh: hey nagoogoo aren’t you supposed to be making a video? Kappa
[3:51:23] JohnnyOneLung: I love this hypothetical gamer lobotomy scenario
[3:52:33] Sebleh: @johnnyonelung how do I get one of those so I can forget I’m subbed to this channel and actually be productive at work? seblehCope
[3:52:33] Zirconn__: what bad take did I miss
[3:52:53] i_Luccas: fyi light setup for today looks really nice
[3:53:08] JohnnyOneLung: I think that's why I like TGP a little bit more for that reason but that's subjective
[3:53:21] NexyTrox: For MDI to show how much effort it takes, maybe having players log their hours and have that shown might help viewers understand the time commitment KEKW
[3:53:45] theskot: could release it after but no one would watch i guess
[3:53:45] Sebleh: @nexytrox that’s not gonna make a difference
[3:53:46] theskot: or few people
[3:53:57] whup_nz: I understand how difficult the MDI is, because I do MDI pulls in my PUG keys
[3:54:02] JohnnyOneLung: I spent a lot of time at Golden Guardians begging people just to stream rather than tryhard so much, burn out and get second
[3:54:09] Sebleh: someone who can’t grasp how much time practice takes can’t grasp an amount of hours for it
[3:54:10] JohnnyOneLung: at least with streaming, you get viewership which they can monetise
[3:54:13] theskot: @whup_nz bruh right
[3:54:38] StreamElements: For Highlights, fun content and guides, remember to subscribe to my youtube channel -> https://www.youtube.com/naguura
[3:54:44] Cepheia__: ky
[3:54:50] Cepheia__: !followage
[3:54:50] StreamElements: @Cepheia__, cepheia__ has been following naguura for  5 years 5 months 19 days 3 hours
[3:55:31] Zirconn__: then the community will clown on one team for spending x time and still losing lll
[3:56:14] darkHPH: I wouldnt mind watching them doing even higher keys than just 23s etc :c @Naguura
[3:56:44] boyzbee: B03 same map would be boring to watch but early rounds most consistent teams would advance to finals rounds with different maps
[3:57:01] NexyTrox: Honestly I just think the wow community will never be happy with MDI lol
[3:57:06] Kuroz: freedom
[3:57:10] Kuroz: hmmMeeting
[3:57:36] Zirconn__: but then you can’t use it as an excuse to not do the video
[3:57:38] StreamElements: If you enjoy the stream make sure to check naguura out on her Socials : https://twitter.com/Naguura // https://www.youtube.com/naguura // https://www.instagram.com/naguura // tiktok.com/@naguura
[3:57:41] Sebleh: Honestly you can make a statistic about the hours of practice and the number of resets and people who think MDI is easy still won't understand how much work it is. Just like they see 400 pulls on Tindral and Fyrakk and go "lmao a raid boss can't be that hard it only took me 5 pulls on heroic"
[3:57:47] Kahlandra: @NexyTrox you could have left off the "with mdi" part and still been correct
[3:58:38] StreamElements: Join Naguura on her journey to become the most casual of transmog farmers! Goth Naguura AKA “Nagothica” has been challenged to farm a goth transmog for her character and will be wearing a goth transmog IRL to match! Guidelines are posted in the #Nagothica channel of Naguura’s Discord. Date TBD.
[3:58:55] theskot: TGP is more relatable because they do similar things i do in my keys. but i like seeing them break the game in MDI
[3:59:07] Sebleh: It's crazy how much interest drops from the first weekend to the second, and within weekends from the first day to the second.
[3:59:07] darkHPH: atal is boooring to watch
[3:59:45] whup_nz: I love the MDI and TGP equally and I wish we could have them both each season but understand why we can't
[3:59:49] Sebleh: Lofibanshee made a great little chart of how many times each dungeon was run.
[3:59:54] Zirconn__: people also have a warped perception of what a WoW PvE focused esport should be because they think you can format it like a MOBA except it’ll never work that way.
[4:00:01] NexyTrox: Yeah, like the rank 7 and 8 teams in MDI never really stand a chance versus like Echo or Perplexed. But people still forget they are part of the top 80 players in the world lol, they are freaks of nature in wow.
[4:00:06] Sebleh: BRH and AD were the most popular by far, Throne/Rise/Waycrest were the least IIRC
[4:00:13] Druzlek: thats why i just wait till global finals to watch haha
[4:00:32] JohnnyOneLung: the MDI should just be a short Buzzfeed quiz on which Harry Potter Character you are and the audience picks who got the best one via twitch poll
[4:00:55] Sebleh: @JohnnyOneLung MDI - Mharry Dpotter Iquiz - Genius!
[4:00:57] NexyTrox: @JohnnyOneLung Best idea
[4:01:28] theskot: a lot of people watch to see crazy tech
[4:01:31] throwmasterlol: but then they crack out the sub rogue and its hella fresh
[4:01:39] quest649: quest649 subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 6 months! 
[4:01:47] Kuroz: naguuraLove naguuraLove naguuraLove
[4:02:10] alexz_gegee: today in generell excitement curves are not longer then the average tiktok video
[4:02:16] Zirconn__: naguura dungeon tournament ft moist esports Kappa
[4:03:55] sparklifegaming: The viewership would be higher for sure
[4:04:15] whup_nz: What about an MDI/TGP hybrid, where you're still running for time, with a dungeon pool revealed at the start of the weekend? Then we'd see the teams iterating on comps and strats to get the best time.
[4:04:39] Zirconn__: I think you could have a similar format to the original StarCraft 2 WCS world tournament. Top 4 from each region compete in a region versus region tournament, then the top 4 from that tournament play a live world final.
[4:05:11] theskot: its always way more exciting when 2 teams take different routes for example, not everyone doing the same route
[4:05:20] Kuroz: regionals were so fun...
[4:05:24] Kuroz: oce regionals
[4:05:24] Sebleh: We literally have one NA team in the entirety of MDI right now.
[4:05:31] Kuroz: Aware
[4:05:42] Sebleh: And if you do regional qualifiers, the global finals is a 50th seed team from NA getting 2nd for NA
[4:05:45] alexz_gegee: EU is stronger did you hear this guys start the fight :D
[4:05:58] whup_nz: Didn't OCE win the first couple of MDIs?
[4:06:04] Kuroz: chinese team weren't even doing time trials at the end
[4:06:14] Kuroz: they won the first
[4:06:22] Kuroz: with a 50 minutes seat
[4:06:26] Kuroz: not exactly current mdi
[4:06:36] Sebleh: No one OCE team IIRC?
[4:06:46] Sebleh: Maybe I'm wrong
[4:06:47] NexyTrox: I think the issue with MDI for NA players, is it is more profitable to stream high end keys, than it is to take off to practice MDI. But EU players just seem to enjoy competition more.
[4:06:55] Kuroz: dire wolves
[4:06:59] Sebleh: Yeah Dire Wolves
[4:06:59] whup_nz: Skylark is our OCE rep :D Even though I think he moved country
[4:07:03] Sebleh: I forgot the names lol
[4:07:04] Zirconn__: nah I’m not disagreeing the skill level, but I personally think regional qualifiers kind of light a few under each region and push the skill level. happened a lot in CS and SC:BW+ SC2
[4:07:06] Kuroz: chompey was there
[4:07:09] everygamermike: It would be a lot more interesting to watch the teams develop starts than to watch them all do the same thing in "competition" for 3 days straight.
[4:07:11] Kuroz: hmmMeeting
[4:07:15] Sebleh: Yes because they went up against Dawg so it was Dawgs vs Dawg memes
[4:07:15] Zirconn__: but I’m also a 3k Andy so my opinion is worth nothing
[4:08:34] Anelit21: you need to be responsible streamer AND pro gamer in same time
[4:08:38] Sebleh: IDK what it is that EU has such a higher % of the playerbase that is better than the rest of the world lol
[4:09:03] Zirconn__: they have the time to play games lol
[4:09:16] Sebleh: Clearly EU teams are all just schoolchidren on perpetual summer vacation and can spend their whole day playing WoW seblehCope
[4:09:37] Sebleh: It's guide making time seblehDinkdonk
[4:09:39] Kuroz: the second pull
[4:09:42] Kuroz: you can do it
[4:09:46] Sebleh: After raid.
[4:09:47] Kuroz: hmmMeeting
[4:09:52] Sebleh: You got this googoo
[4:09:58] Zirconn__: NA teams are like the Sunday dad soccer league teams in England vs an established club
[4:10:04] Sebleh: Just type it while you cycle
[4:10:08] ReaperChristian: hey there!
[4:10:16] NicholasK91: the people in the US arent very smart xD
[4:10:17] Sebleh: Oh noooo what a shame you can't cycle tonight AGAIN
[4:10:17] alexz_gegee: its because we cant afford better hardware for tripple a games so we keep playing wow on low graphics forever :D
[4:10:19] Kuroz: you technically have time if the raid is over before 9
[4:10:27] Sebleh: Who could have seen that coming
[4:10:32] Zirconn__: write while you cycle naguuraSip
[4:10:32] Kuroz: the video should taake 45 minutes without distractions
[4:10:33] Faramonde: Did you prep feral for Fyrakk? @Naguura
[4:10:37] Sebleh: @Kuroz She's only going up to smoldeez so it's possible
[4:10:39] Sebleh: Yes
[4:10:59] Sebleh: Have a friend bring you a wireless keyboard and roll the bike to your pc room
[4:11:12] daconcion: Can I play Fyrakk?
[4:11:14] Faramonde: wtf is this
[4:11:21] Faramonde: I checked earlier and wasnt in
[4:11:25] Faramonde: NotLikeThis
[4:11:29] Sebleh: You went hiking yesterday
[4:11:32] Kuroz: it does count
[4:11:39] Sebleh: Listen this meme is specifically only for cycling. If you don't cycle, you lose.
[4:11:43] Sebleh: naguuraWeirdChamp
[4:11:51] Sebleh: You said you cycled but I don't see proof on the discord seblehDinkdonk
[4:12:10] Sebleh: No proof, does not count.
[4:12:20] Kuroz: a spin class hmmMeeting
[4:12:31] Sebleh: No receipts posted, doesn't count NOPE
[4:12:51] Sebleh: So about that second pull... seblehNotes

[4:14:14] Zirconn__: KEKW
[4:14:32] Anelit21: With cardio you need to have so much patience
[4:14:37] Anelit21: dont EVER underestimate it
[4:15:01] Sebleh: Cardio is obnoxious
[4:15:03] Sebleh: ResidentSleeper
[4:15:04] alexz_gegee: have a nice evening guys. Naguuraa thx for answering my quesitons. See ya
[4:15:33] Faramonde: yea, three didgets = banned
[4:15:35] Zirconn__: yeah don’t faint while doing cardio naguuraThinking
[4:15:52] Anelit21: Consistency is key for cardio... it doesnt matter tempo, speed or whatever
[4:15:55] Anelit21: just do it everyday
[4:16:16] Faramonde: Is that why you play tft at like 2 in the night?
[4:16:21] everjaz: do your dailies
[4:16:30] AceReformed: Should also consider adding strength training outside of cardio tho (No you're not going to look like Cbum or The Rock if you pick up some weights) KEKLEO @Naguura
[4:16:31] drastaro: bs, everyday is the worst advice you can give for anyone trying to do cardio
[4:16:31] Starrren: Hello All
[4:16:48] Zirconn__: there’s an app for running (idk if they do cycling) where they play an audio type movie of you being chased by zombies
[4:16:51] AceReformed: D:
[4:16:53] Anelit21: like if you have high expectations and you want to do cardio
[4:16:54] Zirconn__: that should motivate you
[4:16:54] AceReformed: But swoleguura
[4:16:57] Anelit21: god help you
[4:17:01] xSavageALx: Is Balance Druid still hard to do damage in low keys?

[4:17:14] Sebleh: If you lose the Nagothica challenge you have to do one pullup for stream Kappa
[4:17:15] sim967: oooh, 8 new hero trees tomorrow
[4:17:30] drastaro: weekly 3-4 cardio of max 50minutes is more then enough
[4:18:00] Anelit21: @drastaro correct
[4:18:09] Sebleh: They didn't say which trees tho
[4:18:13] Sebleh: April probably
[4:18:14] sim967: well, if the other 2 dps are bad, maybe?
[4:18:21] deepdale: @drastaro that include just walking?
[4:18:23] Sebleh: We know S4 is in april IIRC
[4:18:25] JohnnyOneLung: I'm already alpha mate. don't need some elf nerd to tell me that CoolCat
[4:18:57] drastaro: @deepdale no, I am talking cardio at 220bpm-age hr
[4:19:05] deepdale: @drastaro kk ty :)
[4:19:15] Imprison3d: @Naguura would you say that warlock is easily the best dps or at least the 2nd best for M+ currently?
[4:19:31] Anelit21: @deepdale its like just enough to sweat but not really became uptight with it, like not losing energy or feeling bad
[4:19:36] Sebleh: naguura the activity you should be doing is writing your damn guide seblehDinkdonk seblehDinkdonk seblehDinkdonk
[4:19:43] everjaz: excercise is so personal, it should be fun for you
[4:19:44] Anelit21: @Anelit21 you need kinda to find it yourself
[4:19:45] revengetoday: sending love all the way from the Philippines <3
[4:19:47] JohnnyOneLung: the best cardio workout you can get is going to a bar and finding the biggest person and throwing your drink over them. then run. you'll never commit more.
[4:19:56] Faramonde: Naguura I think you should start deadlifting.. Once you can do 500+kg you'll be really proud of yourself
[4:20:13] AceReformed: Im sorry, i didnt mean it that way Sadge @Naguura I was just suggesting maybe add something to prevent one activity from getting bored, I didnt try to sound demanding
[4:20:19] Anelit21: LUL LUL LUL
[4:20:28] Anelit21: I honestly like only cardio
[4:20:33] Anelit21: everything else is boring to me
[4:20:38] Zirconn__: my motivation was being fit enough to carry my 50 kg dog out of a burning building
[4:20:56] Kuroz: hmmMeeting
[4:21:01] Kahlandra: its so true, i wfh and sit at a desk all day, then on the sofa all night, its hard to motivate some days, but much better to move at all than just sit here every single day
[4:21:37] Kahlandra: alternatively, my husband only does strength training and no cardio
[4:21:44] Sebleh: all of this doesn’t matter anyway because nobody should be telling anyone else what to do anyway. stay in your lane chat naguuraWeirdChamp
[4:21:48] Anelit21: True

[4:22:39] itsClubby: yikes just got an email from twitch saying sub prices are going up Deadge

[4:24:00] Sebleh: US is going up soon too
[4:24:04] JohnnyOneLung: like, it makes sense if your local economy is tanking and your money is worth less, products from other countries are going to get more expensive
[4:24:25] itsClubby: @JohnnyOneLung MadgeBusiness

[4:26:55] Raggu2: (I dont have much hair) but even 24 hours without at least a heavy rinsing is a greasy mess.
[4:26:57] Sebleh: we love that.
[4:26:58] JohnnyOneLung: love it when really small children do something "grown up ish"
[4:27:05] JohnnyOneLung: like if you hear a toddler swear: hilarious
[4:27:39] Andersonmps: How old are they?
[4:27:42] Zirconn__: that’s why I’m not allowed around my nieces and nephews
[4:27:45] Melithian: @JohnnyOneLung Small children paying taxes is the cutest thing
[4:27:45] Sebleh: my niece has no idea who I am but every time she sees me she sees my sister so she loses the “IDK Smadge” pretty quickly

[4:42:37] Sebleh: I hear the same thing tbh
[4:42:54] Sebleh: they’re like the only gamer chairs that aren’t just leftover race car seats

[4:46:00] JohnnyOneLung: and I'd be gutted if I spent 1k+ on a chair and it was just okay
[4:46:09] egg_dishes: I've had the privilege of using Aerons since like 2006 it's definitely worth it if you can find one refurbed. The one I'm using now I bought in 2018 for around 350USD.

[6:32:41] Raggu2: Trigger works, they are essentially just walking bombs
