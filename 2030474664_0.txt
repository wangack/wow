[1:55:14] zachl_: @Sofiaringu if ur looking to add it into omnicd instead of displaying the debuff- go to omnicd>spell editor> go to the section where it says trinket,mainhand and consumables> type in the ID of the cheat trinket or the aura of the trinket> should be able to display cd

[3:50:59] naerchan: last EB i had done was a 20. definitely tricky even with diffuse and revival if you get stuck into a spot with high stacks back to back
[3:51:03] naerchan: i missed mass dispel right away
[3:51:11] naerchan: its a good challenge
[3:52:49] Linith_Heart: i definitely got yelled at for not MDing after every pack

[3:53:37] Valhooli: as a disc priest, at 6 or less stacks, its pretty much not an affix
[3:53:40] ReSeT_VT: "noob tank read tutorial"
[3:53:41] Valhooli: anything more than that its tricky
[3:53:45] ConchubarOD: I looked at my bursting mishaps in vods and it was always some shit overlap + no defensives

[3:54:05] naerchan: dont trust the smart/passive heals
[3:54:35] Tomacco2001: yeah its usally only a problem im eb and maybe wm in pugs. the pulls there are naturally big
[3:54:37] Valleerion: @yumytv 95% of my keys are pugs. and the tank will chain pull 3, 4  or 5 packs an just stack 10-12 mobs and then they get aoe'd down and e end up with 10 stacks 2-3 times before the CD is up for MD haha

[4:02:20] PyrrAetos: @Valleerion The best way to view it is as another boss mechanic. A big pull is happening, so you know big bursting dam is going to come out, so prepare for it like an upcoming boss AOE.
[4:02:23] patymac: Gang Activity
[4:02:31] OcBeefy1: Gang gang
[4:03:08] acoatfulloflizards: the content if the devs we‚Äôre watching gang activity prog
[4:03:18] Kmork1: @Valleerion i mean over commit look at bursting debuff timer and mob hp and prepare accordingly and if you run out of button prio your life
[4:03:35] PyrrAetos: PyrrAetos subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 7 months, currently on a 1 month streak! No joke Growl, your pug adventures video back in BFA (Atal I wanna say) helped me overcome my struggles with bursting way back when. Always appreciate the content yumytvLove
[4:03:51] Valleerion: @PyrrAetos I 100% agree with that and I do. Its just when the tank and DPS create the situation after MD is used and they pull 2-3 packs of mobs for 0 reason and aoe them al ldown. Thats where I have the issues.
[4:04:07] Valleerion: @PyrrAetos When its a pack of 4-6 i have 0 issues.
[4:04:18] Valleerion: its th chain pulls after after cds are used haha
[4:05:28] PyrrAetos: at a certain point with bursting, you just need to go omega triage mode. Dispel yourself, external a dps, and pump into another dps. If they die, they die. You can't always save everyone and it's expected to happen with Bursting sometimes

[9:57:22] n0s0upbr0: It‚Äôs so worth it
[9:57:46] n0s0upbr0: I hope they don‚Äôt break up it‚Äôs bad for the game
[9:57:47] yungbooma: the funny thing is I heard what happened was happening earlier too
[9:57:50] ain_soph93: not excusing it but i think Nerf sounds burned out and like maybe hes dealing with IRL shit sounds like he needs a break but he acted like a bitch
[9:57:52] n0s0upbr0: High end competitive players
[9:57:55] n0s0upbr0: Good competition

[9:58:45] n0s0upbr0: @ain_soph93 I don‚Äôt necessarily blame him I feel like I would‚Äôve screamed ‚Äúgod you guys are trash cans‚Äù too
[9:58:51] honorablecumulon: its not really about the leg sweep
[9:58:59] n0s0upbr0: I‚Äôm just sad The Godfather of rogue is retired
[9:59:07] n0s0upbr0: If he quits I quit brother we walk the same walk
[9:59:09] n0s0upbr0: WE ARE JPC
[9:59:17] flockheart: dont u play hunter
[9:59:32] honorablecumulon: soupbros having a manic episode
[9:59:41] n0s0upbr0: Brother I just quit and I‚Äôm maining runescape now
[9:59:42] ain_soph93: @n0s0upbr0 u gotta recognise when that shits coming from internally tho and not project ur own burnout on people or atleast apologise and say something like "sorry i overreacted i guess im just tired and going through some shit" or something

[10:01:16] whiskeyhide: wildigW
[10:01:17] ain_soph93: dorkis like "hey boys i heard u need a new vdh ;) whats good brehh"
[10:01:40] n0s0upbr0: Brother if he pulls that off he‚Äôs like the chancellor from Star Wars before he kills mace windu
[10:01:49] flockheart: dude star wars spoilers?
[10:01:49] gingerdecaf: is nerf retiring whats up
[10:01:57] honorablecumulon: hopeful was too lighthearted for the team
[10:02:04] honorablecumulon: growl was right
[10:02:06] ritsrawr: dude can someone dm  me the drama... i missed the whole shit and ive been subbed to elle for like 4 years
[10:02:09] whiskeyhide: i think only evenings
[10:02:12] thepleasuremachine: Hopefulge
[10:02:15] ain_soph93: its sad man i feel like the last 2 years thinks have felt so divided theirs conflicts flaring up around the world and even interpersonal relationships it feels like things as a collective are just on a knife edge alot of times, strange times were living in
[10:02:23] ain_soph93: things*
[10:02:35] n0s0upbr0: @ritsrawr honestly it‚Äôs not even good drama bro I‚Äôm just spamming JPC THE KING THE MYTH THE GODFATHER OF ROGUE for no reason bro
[10:02:37] c3rby_: Why do you spell out job like its a swear word?
[10:02:40] Klon_____: all i know is hes a FamilyMan
[10:02:41] Shifftqt: bruh why are u extrapolating ragey wow gamers to "conflicts around the world" lol
[10:02:48] weezull: @ain_soph93 true, culturally people are assholes now
[10:02:59] stagpul: its sad man i feel like the last 2 years thinks have felt so divided theirs conflicts flaring up around the world and even interpersonal relationships it feels like things as a collective are just on a knife edge alot of times, strange times were living in
[10:03:09] thepleasuremachine: imagine working a 9 to 5 COPIUM
[10:03:15] c3rby_: Dont like the younglings in the chat hear about being employed.
[10:03:27] ritsrawr: @yumytv to be fair as someone thats been watching them since BFA.... its not the first time theyve blown up bc of malding never has stuck so it must be p bad
[10:03:33] jujumann35: i did not expect sheesh to last longer than ambition
[10:03:35] ain_soph93: @weezull idk what happened it feels like theirs a general burnout amongst people and lack of empathy maybe covid did more damage psychologically from seeing people as a threat than anything idk
[10:03:51] jyngwei: @stagpul seems dangerous to apply anecdotal incidents to a general understanding of the world
[10:04:07] deanw0w69: nerf literally said he hates playing with elle's most of the time, idk how elle is so cool about that lmao
[10:04:10] jyngwei: and vice-versa
[10:04:27] stagpul: bro it was a copy pasta lmao
[10:04:37] satanlikesicecream: @deanw0w69 elles deserves better
[10:04:45] jyngwei: @stagpul unlucky ima delete my twitch acc now
[10:04:54] stagpul: ICANT
[10:05:10] miyo2322: not knowing every single pasta on the internet ICANT
[10:05:17] Berriesqt: @deanw0w69 i dont think elle even realized that nerf was being serious bc they were all laughing when he muted himself. probably thought it was just a meme situation.
[10:05:22] flockheart: idk most of the shit talking between my friends is just banter
[10:05:35] discomancer1: @deanw0w69 he swears up and down that nerf is only joking when he says stuff like that. now it's proven that that's not true
[10:05:58] jyngwei: @flockheart yeah idk how you can be 30 and be crying over a video game
[10:06:16] K4lsdern: SNIFFA we talkin drama agin
[10:06:18] honorablecumulon: ez play wow 14 hours a day 6 days a week
[10:06:26] deanw0w69: that wouldnt sit right with me, but hey, to each their own i guess
[10:06:34] Berriesqt: ngl for me as a 3rd person listener - i couldnt even tell if nerf was serious or not - it felt like he was just kinda annoyed but not really.
[10:06:35] honorablecumulon: culture rubs off on you
[10:06:48] ain_soph93: man i can get fucking burned out if 1 key gets fucked up and i just do like 20-24's doing 30s all day everyday gotta be exhausting high stress shit
[10:06:53] jimmy____________________: holy
[10:06:58] jimmy____________________: the positivity
[10:07:01] thepleasuremachine: vendor raising morale
[10:07:09] jimmy____________________: just like nerf does for his team
[10:07:12] ScapeeJ: J O B
[10:07:27] deanw0w69: Nerf turned himself into the biggest meme holyFUCKINGshit
[10:07:30] Farva_Shenanigans: so I just watched to clips‚Ä¶. poor ele man. he‚Äôs such a nice guy. also JPC was very kind at the end
[10:07:37] jimmy____________________: lol
[10:07:38] miyo2322: people want to see streamers push the hardest content every day for 12 hours straight, but god forbid those streamers take the game seriously, can't have that
[10:07:42] deanw0w69: JPC always BASEG
[10:07:58] n0s0upbr0: FACTS
[10:08:05] n0s0upbr0: @deanw0w69 the man THE MYTH THE GODFATHER OF ROGUE
[10:08:11] honorablecumulon: yeah ellesmere was the straw that broke the camels back. and it was a reflex stun
[10:08:14] n0s0upbr0: IN HIS NAME WE PRAY

[10:08:36] n0s0upbr0: GOD BLESS JPC
[10:08:42] miyo2322: n0s0upbr0 don't be cringe bro
[10:08:54] deanw0w69: OUR 99 BLACKSMITHING MESSIAH, or what ever the fuck you do in runescape
[10:09:01] ScapeeJ: @miyo2322 He can‚Äôt help be a fan girl. Its in his DNa
[10:09:10] n0s0upbr0: @deanw0w69 OUR BROTHER
[10:09:11] reinhath: what did I miss
[10:09:11] jimmy____________________: @deanw0w69 its just smithing... not blacksmithing
[10:09:18] jyngwei: @miyo2322 taking it seriously is different from crying over every mistake that happens -- if you cant have an honest and mature conversation about performance in a video game by the time you are 30 years old then perhaps putting yourself in high stress situations isnt for you
[10:09:20] deanw0w69: @jimmy____________________ my fault CaughtIn4K
[10:09:22] jimmy____________________: =D
[10:09:24] flockheart: fake runescape players self reporting
[10:09:36] n0s0upbr0: @deanw0w69 we wish him GOOD HEALTH AND PROSPERITY LONG LIVE THE KING THE MYTH THE GODFATHER OF ROGUFE
[10:09:38] Yungpupperz: Just watched the Ellesmere replay of that WM.. What a weird event
[10:09:39] deanw0w69: IM NOT A RUNESCAPE PLAYER, lets make that clear
[10:09:39] flockheart: come back when u have inferno cape bros
[10:09:53] Farva_Shenanigans: it seemed like he stunned right when nerf was saying he was gonna stun. then to say I hate playing with this healer most the time is so fucked since they do so much content together
[10:09:55] ain_soph93: is that gaming chair new growl? looks dope brother
[10:10:00] n0s0upbr0: @deanw0w69 deanwow ur the fucking man don‚Äôt listen to that cringe moron that told me I was cringe ur getting a sub guy
[10:10:23] n0s0upbr0: n0s0upbr0 gifted a Tier 1 sub to deanw0w69!

[10:11:37] deanw0w69: @ritsrawr HE WAS TALKING THE TRUTH
[10:11:42] CptAshman: Hey Growl, how do you deal with Bursting as a Disc Priest?
[10:11:54] reinhath: where can I see this rage clip
[10:11:54] ScapeeJ: @cptashman Heal
[10:11:55] ritsrawr: @deanw0w69  clip or it didnt happen
[10:11:58] Farva_Shenanigans: was very nice at the end of the run and said something like ‚ÄúI‚Äôve enjoyed playing with you all, truly
[10:12:13] deanw0w69: @ritsrawr ARE YOU QUESTIONING HIS HONESTLY, LORD BEHOLD

[10:14:35] CptAshman: @ScapeeJ Oh xD
[10:14:49] ain_soph93: OnlyMans/NerfMySchlong if u wanna see the content
[10:15:14] deanw0w69: this guy is 3.6k and flash healing how embarassing
[10:15:23] Farva_Shenanigans: idk why but I always confuse nerf and yoda.

[10:52:03] n0s0upbr0: That‚Äôs gotta sting a bit
[10:52:14] Farva_Shenanigans: Elle thought he was joking about the this healer comment
[10:52:32] n0s0upbr0: But not really do u know how many jabs people took at growl when he was beating his dick on season of discovery?
[10:52:36] Farva_Shenanigans: then it hit and I felt for him.
[10:52:44] ritsrawr: @crossTTA  TLDR Nerf malded over a SUPER minor thing that didnt result in a single death. Then proceeded to mute his mic on a +30 for the rest of the key because he was mad. JPC was so overwhelmed with the level of immaturity he literally quit the team on the spot.
[10:52:44] honorablecumulon: nerf was kinda cringe
[10:53:12] deanw0w69: @ritsrawr YEA, THATS OUR BASEG ROGUE MESSIAH
[10:53:18] n0s0upbr0: YESZSUHHH
[10:53:19] Farva_Shenanigans: @ritsrawr oh I missed the he quit part

[10:53:43] WaIes: lets not pretend this was "one minor thing" this has probably been stewing for a while and that was the straw that broke the camels back @ritsrawr
[10:53:44] n0s0upbr0: HIM
[10:54:03] ritsrawr: @Farva_Shenanigans  he said if he doesn't unmute he's done forever, then nerf didnt say shit and he was like OK im out

[10:54:50] assumlng: is yoda going non verbal on growl
[10:54:51] japo131313: most hated boss this season i reckon
[10:54:52] Satimy: Need 3 warrior dps
[10:54:54] m_dep: at least the rest of the key is free so theres time to wipe multiple times to yazma
[10:54:55] flockheart: holy the double shroud
[10:54:58] 10000watts: it was the rogue
[10:55:00] m_dep: as is tradition
[10:55:05] ritsrawr: @WaIes regardless they're constantly on the front page of raider i.o. so OBVIOUSLY everyone on that team is polayig out of their mind on a daily basis so whatever hes bitching about doesnt amount to enough to keep them off the front page of RIO
[10:55:09] Shinrayz: Growl gotta report you for misleading title. it should be rapid key depleting KEKL
[10:55:15] IAmSolari: Kush is my rogue goat I fear
[10:55:31] anipsios1: @Shinrayz just wait a tic
[10:55:43] WaIes: @ritsrawr yeah my point being theyve been under extreme stress for weeks
[10:55:44] deanw0w69: i remember watching ambition in s1, they already had so much drama because Elle was "lacking" on the Prevoker, they always tilt so much
[10:55:48] n0s0upbr0: Anyone playing rogue in high keys is literally just on training wheels compared to JPC
[10:55:51] CptAshman: Have they added more random spawn spiders for this?
[10:55:52] n0s0upbr0: It‚Äôs actually disgusting
[10:56:06] assumlng: theyve been playing for what 5 yrs, their fine
[10:56:14] n0s0upbr0: Who the fuck is ambition is that their team name
[10:56:26] Farva_Shenanigans: haven‚Äôt they played since BFA together ?
[10:56:28] Minigamer911: Cocaine and IO destroy friendships
[10:56:32] discomancer1: @assumlng dorki mentioned that he spoke to them privately and that the team is indeed done
[10:56:38] ritsrawr: Honestly... hot take... i think them raiding together was a mistake... doing the Mythic prog and then also doing keys like that is prob just oo much between them
[10:56:43] assumlng: oh rip
[10:56:55] ritsrawr: too much*
[10:56:57] deanw0w69: @discomancer1 source: trust me bro
[10:57:08] discomancer1: @discomancer1 it was in this very stream
[10:57:16] discomancer1: I don't know how far back text scrolls, but it was like an hour ago
[10:57:32] n0s0upbr0: That‚Äôs fucked up man
[10:57:38] n0s0upbr0: I wonder if JPC will do keys with me then
[10:57:42] n0s0upbr0: Fuck his team I‚Äôm better
[10:57:52] Sothis_best_girl: that was pretty close with that spider there lol
[10:58:14] ritsrawr: or he could just play with Scott and , imfiredup tomorrow and probably be R1 in like 3 hours lol
[10:58:14] Farva_Shenanigans: @ritsrawr yeah I didn‚Äôt think about that but at least Elle and nerf raiding together prolly not a good idea. no break
[10:58:20] Satimy: can a paladin bubble and run over all the spiders
[10:58:23] CptAshman: This fight is so fucking spooky
[10:58:32] WaIes: @Satimy ye but then you got shit all over the floor

[14:16:07] ManoMorp: @skarg_23 that's why not assassin but assassination. The act itself does not really have a connection with cloak
