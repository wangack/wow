[0:19:38] Wilocu: did you watch the uberdanger series?
[0:19:45] Skompa: Hey xaryu! Could you please watch if new players can join US Crusader Strike or if it's locked. I don't have a subscription on a US account so I can't look. :)
[0:19:48] VerdenTheBleak: It's ok, the UberDanger video will fill the void buddy

[0:20:20] Meltim: @dcpyg holy crap
[0:20:21] aubrey_orva: I showed my roommates the Barny video and they haven't ever played wow and they were able to follow the storytelling perfectly
[0:20:21] Wilocu: uberdanger series is the most fun barny most epic rav most intense (cause hardcore)
[0:20:22] heygoditsme: yea bad timing for enshrouded
[0:20:23] leonwaltt: enshrouded would be popping off but only slightly more than it is
[0:20:30] Skompa: Hey xaryu! Could you please look if new players can join US Crusader Strike or if it's locked. I don't have a subscription on a US account so I can't look.  :)
[0:20:30] sighwarlock: Enshrouded is kinda ... idk
[0:20:30] taylorsdank: I feel palworld hype dying off very quickly but who knows
[0:20:38] dcpyg: enshourded is that good?
[0:20:38] crissppchicken: ^
[0:20:38] Sneepur: Palworld has dethroned csgo
[0:20:43] Meer_: It would be more popular but palworld appeals to a broader audience
[0:20:44] Sneepur: Check steam charts
[0:20:48] crissppchicken: hows enshrouded?
[0:20:57] LiftedGN: Palworld is so good
[0:21:06] crissppchicken: are you playing alone or with a group?
[0:21:09] Cant0n: Pokemon company publicly mad at Palworld LUL unclear if they can do anything tho
[0:21:15] NekoTheSpook010: @xaryu we need to get Rav and Barny make a vid, that'll blow up wow scene
[0:21:16] TurdBurgison: bro the building is so fun
[0:21:20] kaleeb_uli: Pal world has some updates coming its not gunna die that quick
[0:21:21] blacklexiy: blacklexiy subscribed with Prime.

[0:21:35] creamcheesepow: when will  the new barny be on yt?
[0:21:36] timbeeRR: yo guys did i miss the barny finale?
[0:21:37] DevonAufinde: Enshrouded is rly good. Not valheim good but closeish
[0:21:38] VerdenTheBleak: Apparently Barny is working on a new wow series btw
[0:21:38] crissppchicken: im really looking for a valheim-like to play with friends
[0:21:40] TurdBurgison: you should see my castle
[0:21:54] Meer_: Nintendo when 10 million people are playing exactly what we asked pokemon to release for over a decade xarRage
[0:21:55] pinchhithero: @NekoTheSpook010 Hot take: Rav = Barny
[0:22:01] asloff: well, you made a mud hut SMOrc
[0:22:09] crissppchicken: have u tried valheim?
[0:22:12] dcpyg: ho boy a good stream today!
[0:22:14] VerdenTheBleak: Xar smart, hes like if they wanna keep up they gotta come to stream
[0:22:20] roztoky: So you have talked to the carpentery in enshrouded? U can upgrade the glider
[0:22:23] adam_brisbane: You and Savix make appearance in Pint video series for a second or two
[0:22:32] Cross86: hey xar, how ya doin? get some sleep?
[0:22:34] danbalanceltrist: Nintendo îs a huge company too
[0:22:34] epicmadnesss: @xaryu its funny cuz this will be the first real weekend for palworld and theres alot of ppl on gamepass
[0:22:38] Cross86: also valheim is awesome
[0:22:45] nlichtner: bro you gotta play valheim if you like enshrouded
[0:22:48] Todas: so wait, was there actually a lawsuit filed against palworld?
[0:22:52] JsmokesJ: Man you have to play valheim
[0:22:54] Meer_: Ive played shit tons of pokemon and i could pick out every Pal's reference
[0:22:57] VerdenTheBleak: Do you do the editing or do you have editors?
[0:22:58] doo_dahh: HUH
[0:22:59] chardayashosh: xar is it true you went to harvard?
[0:23:04] LiftedGN: The actual killing of pals really makes a separation between pokemon and palworld
[0:23:04] wprogress: If you like Enshrouded you would prob love Valheim tbh :D
[0:23:05] Kyousiik: Building is like a steep incline at the start. Confusing at first but becomes intuitive...raking the  land even was a challenge at first
[0:23:08] dcpyg: @Xaryu you make your own youtube videos?
[0:23:16] VerdenTheBleak: LUL
[0:23:16] californiacal: I mean you can always just go watch them yourself too
[0:23:16] illimus: Hello Xar community!
[0:23:17] dcpyg: nvm
[0:23:19] DevonAufinde: Dont stream valheim imo. Chat will spoil everything
[0:23:22] sodarf: but now i have to dip out once u start with the finale cuz ididnt saw the one from yesterday reeeeee
[0:23:47] Ervill1: palworld creatures look a lot like pokemon. Somehow pokemon can come up with new pokemon every time, so it's no excuse to say it's hard to come up with anything new
[0:23:52] psn_tazzani: Xar get to enshrouded already. your battle mage looks fun to play
[0:23:55] dcpyg: nintenDog
[0:24:02] rocknsake: there is no active lawsuit, nintendo issued a cease and decist to a dude who made a mod to put Ash in the game.  right now there is no actual lawsuit vs palwordl
[0:24:03] IanEdgerton: it’s good to see you playing summit different from everyone else who is on the Palworld train
[0:24:06] favoritesupport: payoOld
[0:24:10] espi: There's no lawsuit
[0:24:11] Todas: i mean i did describe the ggame to someone as "pokemon with guns" so i get it LUL
[0:24:13] VerdenTheBleak: Honestly its better to have editors it gives you more time with the fam
[0:24:14] Pixiepantss: DaD when? peepoShy
[0:24:15] bramicmar: speaking of editing, is Nicky open to the consulting call Xar? :)
[0:24:16] TheRatPresident: @Xaryu Yo Xar, if you ever go to Norway you should check out the gas stations. They have the best wieners to snack on
[0:24:18] Meer_: every Pal ive seen is a direct rip off of a pokemon , but pokemon ripped off their 1st Gen so its fair
[0:24:22] favoritesupport: payoOld_HF
[0:24:25] mzncheleft: @Xaryu I'm 7-10% body fat. I can do 6 reps at 110 lbs on the ab machine. I can still see some belly fat if I sit. What should I do to get abs?
[0:24:25] skez_live: Xar I know you got a lot going on but what does the Future look like for Xar in Retail wow if at all?
[0:24:29] Bwick48: I dont think there's a current lawsuit, just an investigation
[0:24:32] poppapump: when’s the last time you cut your hair
[0:24:35] AndskiMusic: hi Xarbae
[0:24:39] sighwarlock: do you miss new world
[0:24:43] xTrueEast: for anyone who needs this when homies get 1k viewers you aint gotta let us know you gunna do the dip dip
[0:24:44] crissppchicken: makes sense to stream new games
[0:24:46] cabeshpash: no more wow?
[0:24:50] heymomimonttv: yo xar you should check retail, enjoy the mage changes :)
[0:24:52] VerdenTheBleak: The hype around it is so fun
[0:24:54] aepher09: Tekken 8?
[0:24:58] Doribob1: Doribob1 subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 6 months! valhiem is so good though
[0:24:59] nlichtner: valheim is technically early access so you can stream when 1.0 comes out in a few years :)
[0:25:00] oJNelly: try palworld today, i havent played i kinda wanna see how it is with you playing
[0:25:07] delicioustoast4: @rocknsake yeah I heard someone talk about it and japan has no fair use laws so nintendo can go after people however they want and if they really cared they would have gone after them hard by now
[0:25:07] SleeplezzViking: No more wow
[0:25:08] dcpyg: cant go wrong with Baulders Gate 3
[0:25:10] ThaNave: Lol true
[0:25:20] crissppchicken: wow is from 2004 tho lol
[0:25:24] dreamreamer: retail dooodooooo

[0:25:27] cameron2o9: Whats up big dog
[0:25:28] Doribob1: BG3 is good
[0:25:32] Muddymonk: Just the exploration factor is massive in a game, like the whole chat and the streamer together, a clip can be remembered and spread like wildfire, imo
[0:25:33] heymomimonttv: wowww pika be saying every day you're entertaining the idea of retail again
[0:25:34] notmappa: idk mannn, ray of frost is PUMPIN
[0:25:40] Xuranus83: there’s no lawsuit yet but they are going to review. they probably need to be careful as they themselves may have taken inspiration from other content to create some of their characters. they may not want to open that door.
[0:25:42] Meer_: Ur evolution from Retail to today is amazing bro
[0:25:45] Cant0n: @crissppchicken We're WoW players. Remember its always assumed WoW will always be around. That's Wifey
[0:25:48] dreamreamer: P2 HYPE P2 HYPE
[0:25:48] GotLuck: i think youve answered this already, but any plans on playing cata classic?

[0:26:14] roztoky: @xuranus83 interesting point
[0:26:16] notmappa: im on a bulk
[0:26:19] Cant0n: ASSA
[0:26:24] combopoints: 7-10% is very low. Most likely around 16 ish
[0:26:26] Doribob1: @gareththeceglie title says enshrouded later
[0:26:27] notmappa: tryna get the toji physique
[0:26:35] Cant0n: @notmappa GIGACHAD

[0:27:43] lolartsection: Any SoD with mitch today? @xaryu
[0:27:44] psn_tazzani: I hate when the game is basically already solved and there’s a distinct “meta” that if you don’t follow it you really can’t compete. it’s also probably so much more fun for you as a gamer to play new releases.
[0:27:45] Cross86: eating healthy would play another factor in the belly fat no?
[0:27:46] notmappa: quick flex for the stream xar?

[0:37:33] huckleson: @zzenol29 because mainly 5 apm dads love sod kek that is why im playing retail now
[0:37:34] sergioborghi: HADES

[0:54:37] zugly1337: thats streamers though aswell... streamers are very good at games in general but when they start gibing life advice or thinking they know stuff outside of the game it can get dicey lol

[0:56:13] Ervill1: just dont have anxiety 4Head
[0:56:14] jeangastaldon: The thing for me is, twitch chat can't see someone not being a pro on the thing they are streaming... like viewers are usually watching someone because they're either funny or good at the game...
[0:56:17] TowerZAP: I wonder if shadow of the erd tree will come out this year
[0:56:17] Huntahray: that sounds so pompous and pretentious

[0:56:44] taylorsdank: @Huntahray I think you're missing his point entirely
[0:56:44] jstuwie: Its just your competitive side wanting to be the best at everything

[0:57:33] chungus_ult: oh wow I didn't know you had a sister
[0:57:34] peashooterpete: Do you think streamers are slower in general because they are also focusing on entertaining?
[0:57:35] nawncents: bros mad you had proper parents
[0:57:36] Cross86: just ignore, people have been raised differently @Xaryu

[0:57:43] crontikk: @arobbxcii Utah got better mountains than you big dog
[0:57:43] IPZANG: @Xaryu I think Hunter means that you could have been raised with confidence and love but still develop anxiety from other things :)

[0:57:50] dcpyg: @Xaryu are you mexican?
[0:57:51] JCal07: I never understood anxiety/depression at all until i unfortunately abused drugs. It came on like a chemical thing but now I'm clean and improving. It's not something you can control easily, takes a lot of effort

[0:58:38] Snouda: hey @Xaryu when is the new Barney vid coming to youtube, i cant wait :P
[0:58:39] JonasKyll: Anxiety can come from an infinite amount of reasons. Sure, parents can prevent as much as possible but you were lucky not to be anxious.

[0:59:09] jellyisreal: Dear players,  Yesterday, Nexon's preliminary injunction against Iron Mace for trade secret and copyright infringement was dismissed.  The court ruled that “Iron Mace’s game cannot be viewed as infringing on Nexon’s copyright or trade secrets,” thus rejecting the claims and suspicions that Dark & Darker was developed by using Nexon’s trade secrets and infringing on its copyrights.

[1:09:29] Rev3rendBilly: @Xaryu Hey Xaryu, what's your genuine take on react content? I know it sells and drive engagement and I love your streams but Jesus, do I hate react content and it pains me waste your time doing it.
[1:09:30] NickAle006: that was Aristotle
[1:09:32] zentariontv: stop ranting its barny time
[1:09:33] tsetse2fly: Language is very limited
[1:09:34] logsnar: 100%

[1:09:57] logsnar: that's why i typically use my telepathy skills to communicate. Much easier.
[1:09:59] lordhodza: Language is inharently limiting. You can NEVER fully explain how you feel
[1:09:59] mstr_shake: @hudechkin damn, not a vibe my guy

[1:10:01] zerozuckerl: @hudechkin chill tf out whats that attitude

[1:10:09] pinchhithero: If someone mispronounces a word, you shouldn't judge them for it because it's likely that the first saw the word whilst reading
[1:10:10] redRAID3R: Aristotle
[1:10:10] sergioborghi: @hudechkin so mad
[1:10:11] emaus66: Every disagremeent? Makes no sense
[1:10:11] Cuddle_Bunz: does that mean disagreement can be limited if you have a wide vocab?
[1:10:12] Roaming_Radiance: That's mostly for english, other languages work differently
[1:10:12] RayLawn: miscommunication. weather or not it is misheard or mis said

[1:10:38] frunkness: @xaryu the movie The Arrival leans heavily into that
[1:10:41] Deceasedcheeks: Idk man, pineapple on pizza disagreement is not a lack of words, def a lack of taste on the people who are against it!

[1:10:47] polesreport: I'm just listing random philosophers so don't listen to me
[1:10:48] JCal07: Meh, way too simplified. I do believe he's right to an extent but many people just fundamentally are different and want different things, and evil/sin are real. Some people just want to watch the world burn
[1:10:49] jazzyjoff: I did a thesis about that concept. From his paper Language and Conflict Resolution: The Limits of English
[1:10:49] tonycheese_: andrew tate aka aristotle
[1:10:49] Cross86: Kahn?
[1:10:50] jwillhue: he also said philosophy was already solved and it’s how you live your life
[1:10:50] jeneraljelly: Bro needs a haircut!
[1:10:54] petch18: Hey @Xaryu got into ur stuff through hardcore, love your content, any mage tips for hc?
[1:10:56] logsnar: @frunkness  I just waatched arrival last week and was thinking the same!
[1:10:57] Huntahray: @Rev3rendBilly I could see this point, but the reactions are always related to content he does and also he carries alot of the knowldge with him in his actual gameplay. Plus its fun to watch basically a movie with Xar
[1:10:59] Deceasedcheeks: gimme a sec
