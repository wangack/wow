[0:45:25] CritcobainTV: There's like a whole video telling you what level to go farm which dungeons and how many runs it takes to get revered and shit
[0:45:27] lurkbeee: well dungeon grinding will be more than likely necessary based on server and how launch goes
[0:45:38] Frank4LuLz: seal swopping threat
[0:45:47] selke1rj: does anyone know if you will be able to start leveling a pally as horde with prepatch or do you need to wait till TBC

[0:46:31] Frank4LuLz: @Towelliee  ill be a medic rogue, plenty of bandages

[0:52:19] TheOfficialGimp: don't think the hammer is a quest, you just kill an elite on the pyramid and they drop it, then you take it up the mountain side to forge it
[0:52:42] savvythread: they should randomly shoot flight paths out of the sky -proceed on foot-

[0:55:28] TheOfficialGimp: so what I said then @Nertok12
[0:56:11] Frank4LuLz: @Towelliee The Sacred Mallet drops from Qiaga the Keeper on top of the Altar of Zul in Hinterlands. You then bring it to the top of Jintha'alor and use it near the altar to turn into the Mallet of Zul'Farrak so you can summon Gahz'rilla in Zul'Farrak.
[0:56:19] Nertok12: yes he can combine it with the hit trinket quest an hakkar egg and free the chieftain

[1:24:29] otecshadow: Dead silence about PTR 9.1, maybe not this week ResidentSleeper

[1:25:05] lurkbeee: @therealonous where on earth did you get that take from what i said? comprehension isn't your strong suit i guess
[1:25:05] Kromede: blizzard communication SMOrc good SMOrc ion smash
[1:25:43] SonofHorus82: @lurkbee yeah I've been working from home since last April so I know that not having direct access to my boss if I have any questions about something I'm working on makes my job more difficult. Not to mention the absolute mental drag it is to be in my house all day. I imagine Blizz developers have it more difficult. I have a couple of friends in game design (non-blizz and non-triple a) that have talked to me about how much harder it is to have their approvals come through because of delays.
[1:25:49] Riear_: BC? BC!
[1:25:54] Harskare: If you had to put a % chance on tbc beta today, what would it be?
[1:26:02] Kuzzin: damn this novel in chat
[1:26:38] SonofHorus82: yeah I kind of went off a bit on that one. Sorry guys.

[1:26:44] lurkbeee: @SonofHorus82 i also had to transition to a much more awkward business than online gaming, i think we can agree of all the business types that had to do this transition, online gaming was one of the easier ones
[1:26:44] theoriginalzinng: how do you not have access to your boss, sound like they need better communication tools lol
[1:27:18] SonofHorus82: @lurkbee obviously it was just as difficult with all of the delays in the gaming industry that have happened in the last year.
[1:27:25] Farfic: my biggest request for TBC is dual spec
[1:27:49] lurkbeee: @SonofHorus82 it doesn't really excuse how bad SL has been so far, but thats just my opinion :)
[1:28:12] Farfic: I'd love to faction change my undead priest to blood elf :D

[1:29:09] Camelbak21: Faction Queues
[1:29:21] warrenny: @camelbak21 Or vice versa
[1:29:27] SonofHorus82: @lurkbee what about SL do you not like? Something that is not specific to delays please.
[1:30:00] andre1023: ^ im curious too
[1:30:00] swordwindgaming: But rules are made to be broken. Kappa
[1:30:05] Recaud: @Towelliee without assuming limits on the tbc classic beta, what would you like to do first?
[1:30:19] CritcobainTV: stupid tv just gave a tornado warning telling me to get to a basement.... KEKW I'm already in my mom's basement
[1:30:32] PadidinJones: "What have I said about thinking Earl?"
[1:30:44] SilkeySmooth: private server players with 22 profession alts will ruin the game
[1:30:51] theoriginalzinng: lmao @critcobain
[1:31:03] TheOfficialGimp: weren't a lot of the paid services first implemented in TBC anyway?
[1:31:04] lurkbeee: @SonofHorus82 Torghast overall design, the maws systematically, the campaign / covenants -- the whole time gated system behind boring mechanics i strongly dislike. Granted the mythic raid was fairly fun and the mechanics as well.. for a month....
[1:31:07] mixedmodee: no tbc news?
[1:31:30] lurkbeee: mostly wrath-cata +

[1:31:56] McpoT: barber and faction/race change was wotlk or?
[1:31:59] Khakiduck: the problem with the paid boost is already ppl are planning to have heaps of profession alts, will see how it goes but the classic economy is already borked

[1:32:05] sprert: faction change came september 2009. so in wotlk
[1:32:11] GoodBoy955: cant wait for wod classic POGGERS
[1:32:23] mixedmodee: was there somthing about faction and racechanting
[1:32:40] starlord0027: I think you Couldnt even have two different factions on same server before?
[1:32:59] lurkbeee: im fine with Dual spec and faction change.. with regulation.
[1:33:05] mrwilsoncw: @towelliee we will get everything the same pretty much due to the fact they dont have to do anything or well much and play with there wee wees lol dam pricks
[1:33:07] EggwithEdges: When someone says DON'T MOVE on Shade of Aran, you don't move!
[1:33:12] SilkeySmooth: lfg queue was quality of life:P
[1:33:20] beckett3a: hell yeah
[1:33:20] jeneraljelly: They gonna be rolling in $$ for TBC
[1:33:22] sprert: Also more paid Quality of life stuff = more money for blizz
[1:33:29] keyserv: but what about the original feel of vanilla reee
[1:33:31] diagnosed_adhd: kinda wanna spread that hashtag lol
[1:33:35] Dred_Scythe: Wasn't dual spec BC anyways...?
[1:33:40] banishtyrion: bring back the lag of 2004
[1:33:41] jeneraljelly: It seems like theyre just changing the shit people want anyway though
[1:33:44] Mathhbm: Dual spec was Cata
[1:33:46] lurkbeee: @Dred_Scythe nope, wotlk
[1:33:47] jeneraljelly: hopefully they dont change too much
[1:33:49] beckett3a: leveling through classic once or twice is a fun experience, but after that ...
[1:33:55] Brainmanager: dual spec came in wotlk
[1:33:58] SilkeySmooth: Cant wait to boost a bm hunter and main enhancement shaman

[1:33:59] WhataboutZoidberg: i wonder what min/maxers will do with dual spec. changing per boss fights and shit. could be nutty
[1:34:01] PhoenixAuTv: Classic leveling is dog shit, was fun once with da boys. Never re leveling solo tho, not hard, just ultra boring zzz
[1:34:01] EggwithEdges: Give it all the QoL changes!
[1:34:03] lurkbeee: @mathhbm wotlk man
[1:34:04] Broomba: dual spec lich king
[1:34:11] Dred_Scythe: ...Oh, memory fades me.
[1:34:11] mrwilsoncw: last two months you will be nerfer bc
[1:34:14] mrwilsoncw: get
[1:34:20] Stackamo: i liked no dual spec because you used to get known for being good at your role like a server known tank or server known healer
[1:34:25] JGussey: @Towelliee  Do you play with max settings? I built a amazing computer and still have issues with max settings
[1:34:28] PembrokeWoW: they created leveling as a main aspect of there game back then lol, now it’s designed as a chore
[1:34:38] Madfrak: i dont trust blizzard regulating it they fucked up my server in classic with letting all allies transfering away :(
[1:34:39] starlord0027: Dual spec was the begining of the end.
[1:34:44] Ranger208: I'm good with them putting in a better group finder. Shit is a hassle and a half in Classic.
[1:34:48] Mathhbm: @lurkbee yeah true
[1:34:49] lurkbeee: @Stackamo mm but there is so many situations, like hybrids, and PVPers that just need it badly
[1:34:55] PembrokeWoW: and ur mindset is set on being a chore when you look back
[1:35:06] TheOfficialGimp: no changes. I want 10k people flooding in to hellfire peninsula through a chokepoint on PvP servers with no layers. that'll be great right? (hint... og server population cap was 2.5k and it was horrible then)
[1:35:09] jeneraljelly: People basically quit retail just as fast though :(
[1:35:10] banishtyrion: #nochanges 8-hour server maintenance
[1:35:14] SonofHorus82: @lurkbee I 100% agree with you about the Maw. It's easily my least favorite zone of all time. Torghast has it's moments though and I don't dislike the leveling or the covenant campaigns.
[1:35:23] xBanosh: would be better to allow more than one 58 boost imo
[1:35:24] roflpotamus: I feel like Towel is lvling so fast lol
[1:35:25] lurkbeee: @Ranger208 The dungeon finder tool that was in TBC - 2007 which is an upgrade from classic is 100% fine imo, we dont need the automatic queue/teleport system for TBC
[1:35:28] gamernick410: PogO @pembtw
[1:35:51] Mathhbm: One boost is just fine
[1:35:59] PhoenixAuTv: Dual spec should be a must tbc, its sucks not being able to play other specs of your class because its a gold sink. So you only play one spec which suks
[1:36:03] keyserv: I'll still play TBC+ as long as there's no LFR and server sharding.
[1:36:12] jamarky23: Lol this dude wants a million bots ingame LUL
[1:36:13] Ranger208: @lurkbee Agreed. No instant teleports, but just a system to find people who want to do a dungeon.
[1:36:16] lurkbeee: one boost is great... a nice stepping stone for people who didnt play Classic, and just enhances tbc population
[1:36:20] PawgersHC: Thoughts on fresh classic/fresh tbc servers? maybe not at release but over the long run, they have to release fresh servers right?
[1:36:25] Farfic: Yea I want to be a shadow priest.. but I'd also like to heal heroics if needed without spending 50g to respect every time
[1:36:29] SilkeySmooth: yea you want more boosts make more accounts
[1:36:35] Broomba: blizz gives u an inch you want more and it ruins the game
[1:36:44] DramaticTv: @Towelliee  what server are you on?
[1:36:51] DramaticTv: in classic
[1:36:52] SonofHorus82: !server
[1:36:52] Moobot: We want YOU for a WoW TBC raiding guild! Apply now! || http://towelliee.com/tbc || We will be choosing Azuresong Horde for our TBC server! Start leveling now! || Not playing Pally, no Blood Elfs yet || No TBC Launch date yet.
[1:36:53] PhoenixAuTv: @grittz6690 i feel if they did it they should do on release not later tbh
[1:36:55] lurkbeee: @Ranger208 yeah man i tihnk you will like the TBCs queue system, its a little dated feeling but a big improvement from classsic
[1:37:00] Khakiduck: I mean the botters will
[1:37:00] Schloshed: Dual spec would have great potential of making TBC GOAT-Y
[1:37:01] TweakT: any Beta males? richkidPog
[1:37:06] Mathhbm: @lurkbee i think they will put a LFG tag most or will make a better one than tbc had
[1:37:08] xBanosh: is it per BNet account?
[1:37:15] Wildside1177: HOw does someone boosying a second character affect anyone else?
[1:37:20] Wildside1177: boosting
[1:37:30] SilkeySmooth: im going to main an enhancement shaman ansd have a bm hunter alt boosted
[1:37:38] TweakT: spreading their max lvls is better in case they get banned
[1:37:39] PawgersHC: @PhoenixAuTv sure, but that doesnt sound like its gonna happen right now on release. i guess i meant more like a seasonal fresh server release type thing
[1:37:40] assman_ny: Gym like to kill me this morning.  Old man hiccup I guess
[1:37:40] xBanosh: account doesnt cost anything today
[1:37:45] xBanosh: only monthly sub
[1:37:47] lurkbeee: @mathhbm i dont remember having a problem with the TBC one thinking back, but maybe some smoothing out can be done to it, id be fine with it
[1:38:09] mixedmodee: is it benet account dam bouth oaf my accounts are on the same bnet
[1:38:29] jerexify: @Towelliee and chat: How long does mail take between two of your own characters in Classic? An hour?
[1:38:30] lurkbeee: pre-patch exp rates Kreygasm
[1:38:32] assman_ny: Gets more fun in BC
[1:38:32] Tava11: Maintainene exteneded?
[1:38:34] toxic_suede: I think the bonuses of playing different classes while in a group should be upgraded. it should be more positive to play a diverse group.
[1:38:38] Beriech: An hour @jerexify
[1:38:43] Ranger208: I think the 1 boost is fine. I believe there are a lot of people who would want to come back but wouldn't because of the wall that is leveling in classic. This lets them come back and we have a larger population to play with.
[1:38:44] roflpotamus: TBC Poggies
[1:38:45] EggwithEdges: BC is the Classic+ people want
[1:38:45] lurkbeee: and all the specs are a lot better
[1:38:46] SilkeySmooth: classic was meant for raid logging
[1:38:49] Khakiduck: heroic dungs gonna be the shit
[1:38:51] jerexify: @Beriech OK, that's what I thought. Thanks.
[1:38:58] Stackamo: cant wait for bc when you can use thunderclap in defensive stance
[1:39:22] TheOfficialGimp: bc = classic with more content and some (but not much) class balance
[1:39:28] Mathhbm: @lurkbee its more about the interface, the tbc lfg one was nothing intuitive, for what i see they you put the retail one in tbc
[1:39:36] jeneraljelly: eww what is that demon hunter purple lol
[1:40:03] Kinghorn: power source is final boss iirc
[1:40:23] TweakT: u can kite last baws upstairs
[1:40:28] Shrenko: just pull the boss to up the room
[1:40:30] TweakT: then its ez clap
[1:40:38] roflpotamus: the healer now pepeMeltdown
[1:40:38] lurkbeee: @mathhbm i mean it serves its purpose, its queues you up to a dungeon, and there is a list generated for people forming the group. its basically shadowlands one with out ilvl and a bit more navigating
[1:41:04] Kinghorn: imagine cheesing a 15 year old boss
[1:41:15] sc0otsmcge3: Server lists up yet chat?!
[1:41:17] Shrenko: easiest is just to take the boss to the upper room
[1:41:18] Grother: @Ranger208 yeah, but i think leveling your toon should be a necessary part of every mmmo game, what's the point in starting at max level skipping all content
[1:41:19] lurkbeee: @mathhbm it was extremely intuitive for its time and comparative to classic
[1:41:27] TweakT: stay safe
[1:41:32] andre1023: says till 11
[1:41:45] sc0otsmcge3: Can have hopes 🤣

[1:45:05] lurkbeee: shadowlands -- you navigate 3-4 drop down menus to select your dungeon and difficulty.. TBC -- you use 1-2 drop down menus to select the dungeon and difficulty.. - Shadowlands: you select people from a list generated from queueing TBC: you are also presented with a list of people that queued for said dungeon. @mathhbm
[1:45:31] Mathhbm: @lurkbee just open the two tools side by side and you will see de difference lol, but it's okay if you think the tbc lfg interface is good for today, im fine with your opinion w/e
[1:45:57] lurkbeee: @mathhbm i outright said its dated. but functionality its very alike. which it is
[1:46:40] mmrghost7: god no
[1:46:40] lurkbeee: yeah, i hope not
[1:46:45] othraerir: join a guild if you wanna raid
[1:46:51] SilkeySmooth: raider io for heroics?...lmao
[1:47:26] andre1023: raider io for classic lmao
[1:47:46] SilkeySmooth: right tbc raider io for heroic dungeons..lmao
[1:48:01] ninedraft317: they had a add on for gear score for tbc
[1:48:01] lurkbeee: i fully expect a gear score, but that was kind of around in 2007-2009 as well, but raider io... please no
[1:48:06] toobaked1987: WTF servers are down until 11. HOLY SHIT. How am I going to no-life now?
[1:48:28] andre1023: Just leave the retail stuff in retail

[1:49:42] lurkbeee: nah i dont think its nitpicking, there is serious mechanics that are behind not being able to port in TBC i.e needing flying to reach netherstorm dungeons to finish kara attune
[1:49:45] SilkeySmooth: why not its just heroic dungeons..lol
[1:49:50] Sincline387: they are using the LFG tool, not LFD or LFR.....so it's basically the same process as the one that came with TBC, just prettier and easier to use
[1:49:57] Majorpain2587: a little off topic now... that 6 minute wait is brutal LUL I'm not an anti-boost andy, but I would much prefer they implement the recruit a friend leveling and heirlooms instead.
[1:50:15] andre1023: ^
[1:50:17] andre1023: sound idea
[1:50:38] lurkbeee: @Sincline387 indeed very important not to confuse LFG with LFD/LFR, LFG is basically just a "prettier" TBC LFG, same functions
[1:50:51] Mathhbm: no heirlooms pls god
[1:50:56] zekobunny: Group finder yes please
[1:51:04] andre1023: lol
[1:51:04] GodKingMuninn: tbc had RaF
[1:51:09] TweakT: heirlooms ruined leveling
[1:51:11] andre1023: shot down
[1:51:11] Kromede: super heirlooms Kappa
[1:51:15] WhataboutZoidberg: not everyone has friends to recruit heirlooms were in tbc right. from valor tokens?
[1:51:15] jason_tacey: heirlooms would destroy tbc
[1:51:19] rLocks: That grind to 70 was a Bi#%$@
[1:51:21] kappaday23: Kappa
[1:51:26] warrenny: Xp gems?
[1:51:37] ScriptzSB: @WhataboutZoidberg they were implemented in wrath
[1:52:33] Majorpain2587: the heirloom gear was literally for alt leveling. you already experienced the azeroth/dark portal leveling. you wouldn't care about the experience the second time through
[1:52:42] zodd_amhai: 60-70 is the best leveling experience too date
[1:52:42] TweakT: pleasantly plump

[1:52:43] EggwithEdges: 60-70 isn't that long
[1:52:45] lurkbeee: RaF was basically wrath pre-patch so i dont think it can be attributed to The Burning Crusade.
[1:52:48] Wall_ass: you think they are going to do seomthing about Naxx gear and thunderfury being used until T5 content?
[1:52:50] TweakT: clashick wow is best nostalgia
[1:52:55] Rayman_1990: we once wiped in Uldaman at last boss when he was 1%, true classic experience Kappa
[1:53:04] lurkbeee: TBC leveling is super good compared to vanilla
[1:53:11] purpgarma: 60-70 was ez
[1:53:14] swordwindgaming: People who say 60-70 is hard hate questing in the zones.
[1:53:22] TweakT: I'm always gonna play clashick wow for leveling
[1:53:25] Mathhbm: Doing quests in Nagrand is one of the best things
[1:53:38] Beriech: Yes! The Nagrand questing was soooo cozy
[1:53:41] Rottencoarse: @Towelliee  do u think they will implement wow token for tbc/classic
[1:53:47] EggwithEdges: The Journey wasn't a thing on Classic WoW asd
[1:53:54] lurkbeee: yea
[1:54:23] lurkbeee: the initial gearing in TBC is so fun and yep some thing you have to grind at
[1:54:25] duncon: wasn't the appeal in classic was that earlier dungeon gear was still relevant in the end game?
[1:54:28] Mathhbm: Classic is more massive in quests, in TBC it flows way better

[1:54:52] TweakT: they had actual mathematicians doing mathematics in tbc?
[1:55:03] zekobunny: They should add the token no doubt
[1:55:07] Rottencoarse: @Towelliee  thx man
[1:55:52] lurkbeee: of course they want there hand in the pie that is gold selling, soooo much money has been made third party from classic gold selling.. and if they regulate it well enough it can be done right
[1:55:57] Khakiduck: all you have to do is /who and type in "blackrock rogue" and those are all pickpocket bots LUL
[1:56:01] mavericks312: heroic shattered and heroic slabs were a pain in the dick
[1:56:11] Boothbay: I just want a race change even if it is 1 per account
[1:56:15] rLocks: I am not really wanting Shadowlabs back... LOL
[1:56:40] Afrostump: server list is up already, nice
[1:56:46] lurkbeee: slabs is pretty chill, not looking forward to shattered halls personally
[1:57:12] ScriptzSB: Shattered halls might be a pain in the ass but its still one of my favorite dungeons LUL
[1:57:20] lurkbeee: and hunter pre-bis dungeon set piece comes from last boss in shattered halls :(
[1:57:33] lurkbeee: oh dont get me wrong, i love it
[1:57:35] ScriptzSB: Same
[1:57:40] lurkbeee: its such a good dungeon
[1:57:45] rLocks: Steam Vault
[1:57:48] MrGattz: now mana tombs on the other hand..
[1:57:50] lurkbeee: but many nightmares from it :P thats a good thing tho
[1:57:53] swordwindgaming: shattered halls is a good dungeon but you can't really pug it
[1:57:55] Wall_ass: The Bladefist Kreygasm
[1:58:00] ResponseFox: Shatterd Halls + Prot Paladin = EZ mode
[1:58:06] Mathhbm: Heroic Arcatraz NotLikeThis
[1:58:14] Shamuh: People didnt like it because it was one of those few dungeons where the damage was crazy and if you didnt CC correctly it will be a wipe fest
[1:58:20] rLocks: It wasnt the dungeons themselves it was the amount of times we had to do them, over and over and over  just for one item for one person....
[1:58:43] lurkbeee: yeah i also had terrible luck from kargath dropping my piece SwiftRage

[2:03:58] lurkbeee: @SonofHorus82 Low key tip, skinning and mining makes bank atm, a lot of people buying it for LW and BS for TBC, ive made a pretty penny doing it the past few weeks
[2:04:01] GenMysters: You have to be able to afford that flying once TBC hits
[2:04:07] odinsdad75: this server is definitely frustrating

[2:04:41] SonofHorus82: @lurkbee on Azuresong? I do pretty well with cloth but I'm working on LW so I'm keeping my leather.
[2:04:41] Kinghorn: and he will laugh in your face LUL
[2:04:47] odinsdad75: go up
[2:04:47] Nett3y: lol makes me think of battered hilt xD
[2:04:49] Paladine_Dragonslayer: Dew EEET
[2:05:14] GenMysters: @Towelliee Kargath before server up bet   again?
[2:05:17] lurkbeee: @SonofHorus82 not on azure, but on a couple other servers, I can't imagine being much worse on azuresong, probably less profitable
[2:05:23] TheOfficialGimp: to be fair a paladin with sfs can farm up quite a bit of gold, but I stil wouldn't pay 5k
[2:05:40] CritcobainTV: The engineering shield?
[2:05:40] ScriptzSB: The Engineering Disc
[2:05:49] othraerir: the one in mc?
[2:06:00] ScriptzSB: The Engi one ends up costing a lot cus it breaks quick from durability
[2:06:02] SonofHorus82: @lurkbee oh ok. Yeah I have quite a few characters on Atiesh that make pretty good money by farming twink items and crafting mats.
[2:06:11] lurkbeee: nicee
[2:06:15] TheOfficialGimp: the issue with that shield is that it breaks A LOT
[2:06:22] Codeman6: what serve are you on?
[2:06:25] Brodih_: engineers in TBC can make that heli flying mount, kinda cool
[2:06:25] thornpush: towCringe_SG
[2:06:29] CritcobainTV: yeah it breaks a ton unfortunately
[2:06:35] thornpush: towCringe_SG towCringe_SG
[2:06:49] soysos91: time to watch WoWHobbs guides to aoe farming? haha
[2:06:57] CritcobainTV: I pugged MC on my mage already, and I'm doing BWL this weekend on my rogue
[2:07:08] lurkbeee: prot pally first thing im getting is the sporegarr rep shield LUL
[2:07:21] 1godofwar0: hobbs is a true chad
[2:07:24] ArcaneSyntax: the one upside to vanilla raiding is that most of it is so easy you can pug into stuff and actually clear content.
[2:07:27] rLocks: does this mean Big Red Kitty is coming back????
[2:08:02] lurkbeee: @ArcaneSyntax is that really an upside Kappa
[2:08:08] SonofHorus82: @lurkbee me and a guildie are also going 70/30 on Arcanite Bars. I get 70 because I'm the farmer so that's making a bit of gold too.
[2:08:17] lurkbeee: very smart
[2:09:17] aeon0987: @Towelliee making it rain
[2:09:21] nikekickz: Love seeing old org
[2:10:02] Ldysansa: What server are you on in classic
[2:10:10] ArcaneSyntax: oh man I remember in Wrath they made the mallet an actual item, an 8 strength, 8 stam 1 h mace that you could get at like level 30
[2:10:12] mongsns: Will there be reduced xp from 1 to 60 in prepatch?
[2:10:16] Mathhbm: SW song and is in org, LUL
[2:10:29] Mathhbm: @mongsns 30% exp buff
[2:10:46] rLocks: You can't boost a draenei or blood elf character You can only purchase the boost once per account The boost only works on Burning Crusade Classic, not WoW Classic
[2:10:54] lurkbeee: Cheeky sweaty bank right there mate
[2:10:55] Kinghorn: azuresong Ldysansa
[2:11:04] Kinghorn: need a bank boof
[2:11:05] NovaSun84: I tried to redo the classic level experience.. got to 12, FeelsBadMan I'll see you at 58 with a "boosted" shaman for TBC dude LUL
[2:11:14] Ldysansa: ty
[2:11:31] Farfic: rip
[2:11:34] Yagr6: i stopped playing classic just for the simple fact i couldnt press earthshock with out pulling aggro.. went back to retail
[2:11:38] Darzetti_: yea i can see them do that for sure
[2:11:48] lurkbeee: yeah its nice
[2:11:59] Khakiduck: can still dungeon boost them KEKW
[2:12:04] brotherzttv: what classic server is this?
[2:12:13] Waspire: you can mob tagg to 50. easily
[2:12:14] Kinghorn: if you see a 60 blood elf you know they did it the hard way, getting boosted
[2:12:14] ScriptzSB: im super pumped to lvl my belf
[2:12:15] rLocks: If you plan on playing a blood elf of draenei, you're going to be able to start leveling that character before Burning Crusade Classic launches. Back in the day, players wanting to make the switch had to wait until the expansion was already out, putting them way behind their guildmates.
[2:12:16] toobaked1987: @Towelliee has GFUEL sent you a hammer squad jacket yet?
[2:12:33] lurkbeee: @Khakiduck wont really be able to dungeon boost a Blood elf, pre-patch deletes mage boost. Draenei could still potentially be paladin boosted.
[2:12:48] mavericks312: ghostlands leveling was pretty cool

[2:13:55] Rottencoarse: or go to southshore and run
[2:13:58] ArcaneSyntax: @Towelliee fly to Tarren Mill and then behind durholde keep is the path
[2:13:59] Rottencoarse: depends on u
[2:14:11] longdongliam_: old org is so satisfying
[2:14:18] Nett3y: Omg I love gfuel. I get the sonic rings and fazeberry at 7-11

[2:41:32] wadethewaters: Makes you appreciate TBC, how many raids did they have on launch? was it 4 something?
[2:41:51] SilkeySmooth: @Towelliee give everyone 2 legendaries and players wil lcome back
[2:41:53] Sincline387: @wadethewaters cause the 1 and 2 boss raids totally qualify :)
[2:41:56] Armdel: well they say the plan expansions years in advance, so to keep up with the plan i'm guessing they can't really cut the raid short without breaking the story
[2:41:57] maccaruso: Was dual spec in TBC datamined or were we just speculating?
[2:42:07] Gregadeaux: a new expansion in a year?
[2:42:11] wadethewaters: @Sincline387 A raid is a raid :)
[2:42:11] Armdel: cut expansion short*
[2:42:13] CritcobainTV: F
[2:42:38] Gregadeaux: If it's released next summer, that's not even 2 years. That's like 1.5 years
[2:42:49] Gregadeaux: Shadowlands has been out not even 5 months yet
[2:42:50] TheOfficialGimp: they could do it tbc style and release multiple tiers in a single patch

[2:43:22] CritcobainTV: @Towelliee what are you talking about, everything is on schedule according to Ion KEKW
[2:43:34] Tobysina: Catchup is a b''''
[2:43:36] Armdel: i just seeing them not being able to do it without breaking the story apart if they have to cut planned raid tiers

[3:13:23] ktownchef: minus the homicide
[3:13:23] Lamp680: Need someone other than Cam to throw to them for sure.
[3:13:27] nihilistic_bat: cam washupton
[3:13:39] jahnnyguac: He's always been in sync with Olsen, so TE's should be good for him
[3:13:48] Mathhbm: Imagine if Patriots draft Zach Wilson
[3:14:03] ktownchef: They will have to trade up to get wilson
[3:14:18] wetzl: whoa, towelliee is a colts fan? how did i not know that
[3:14:19] RocketMan23: jimmy g never had a superbowl form, he was carried by that running game and defense
[3:14:48] ktownchef: yup.. when they played the vikings he threw 3 passes that all should have been picked off only 1 was
[3:15:07] SonofHorus82: I wish espn would stop reporting on how likely Wilson and Watson are to get traded. It's not going to happen.
[3:15:07] ktownchef: ever since that game shanahan doesn't trust him.
[3:15:11] jahnnyguac: neither can Jonnu
[3:15:28] RunklePunch: cam is going to rush for 1.5k yards when they run a 2 TE set
[3:15:33] toxic_suede: well a vaccine is basically in this case dead covid virus. this triggers a response from the immune system to make anti bodies. So in effect it trains your immune system to make the correct soldiers.  But in a few few cases the immune system responds in different ways causing some side effect that wasn't anticipated. We're all different.
[3:15:35] Jeffberg: Henry ahs never played 16 games in season in his career. Smith is a one year wonder. Its risky to spend on them, but big upside.
[3:15:42] mavericks312: its all the usual suspects spending early
[3:15:55] ktownchef: he better since he can't throw anymore
[3:15:56] RunklePunch: gotta run a nickel to defend it lol
[3:15:58] wadethewaters: @toxic_svensk thats not how this vaccine works btw, its not the same as a conventional vaccine, i would do some research if i were you
[3:16:17] Yagr6: idk if cam can get that magic back he had that one year

[3:17:30] othraerir: how's the one with the blood clots?
[3:17:39] toxic_suede: astrazeneca
[3:17:41] Celestia6: I had Pfizer, it just made my arm sore and I felt sleepy for a day after the 1st shot. Heard the 2nd shot is the bad one
[3:17:44] FruckAwesome: but you already shirtless so you fine hehe
[3:17:46] gurnt4: wife took pfizer i took moderna but were fine 1st shot, second mild fever and body aches for less than a day
[3:18:11] neverbornlucky: my parents had that covid shot and they are ok no rashes
[3:18:31] toxic_suede: a bit of "illness" is expected when you take a vaccine. since the body has to respond
[3:19:00] Avinar: walking dead vaccine
[3:19:00] othraerir: the way we're going, i should get the shot by 2023
[3:19:02] Redbearded16: @towelliee  I took the second shot and started queuing for LFR dont recommend
[3:19:19] gurnt4: your arm felt like someone punched it for a day or two

[3:22:20] tripreality00: @toxic_svensk This is a messenger RNA vaccine. It is not the same as a traditional vaccine that uses the virus itself. It actually identifies a little protein that the virus uses to replicate and identifies that protein to trigger the immune response.

[3:25:39] wadethewaters: It's actually scary how many people will be getting the vaccine without actually knowing how it functions differently than any other vaccine you have had previously...
[3:26:08] othraerir: it's rushed
[3:26:09] Avinar: my great uncle could be a great tester though since he has the Cali variant and the normal, so he's sad covid twice within two months. poor guy
