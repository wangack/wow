[0:56:42] paragonandrew: @Goonygoon84 They alos don't get to every question in a Q&A stream, so how is them not discussing what certain people wanted discuss any different? They were never going to go over future storyline points, which is what most people seem to want to see.

[1:10:25] gachimaster69: Fix the game instead of talking about lore LUL
[1:10:26] Okami_117: @Warcraft Could we have Silvermoon have a slight update so that we can see that they are preparing for the war to come to their homelands instead of them waiting for it to come to them? They could even start acting desperate or scared the closer each warfront gets to Silvermoon and see it reflected in the city itself. You know the works, enlistment booths, propaganda posters, heavier patrols guarding the lands, having Silvermoon get fixed finally so that there isn't a big gaping hole for the All
