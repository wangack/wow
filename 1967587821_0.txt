[2:13:16] projectthebaby: You should compete in OverWatch
[2:13:20] ocean_sunshine: I thought they cancelled all their OW competitive events
[2:13:22] Cowardpatty: Always thought it was cool how teams had their own skins in Overwatch.  Kind of lame that the game's popularity has died off
[2:13:26] ocean_sunshine: they were offering teams millions to quit
[2:13:28] thukah: Wojder how numbers have been with cs2 out
[2:13:31] robanatsu: :O dude that arcade is epic
[2:13:33] 인터넷포트: wait what:??
[2:13:35] Xaviwan078: overwatch 1 classic!!!
[2:13:38] 인터넷포트: they are doing pvp games?
[2:13:49] mrblond5: yea wow is probably going to be last on the show
[2:13:58] 인터넷포트: they cancelled Wow but do overwatch games thats so odd
[2:14:01] Gizimoo86: tracer
[2:14:06] Pallyofhell: wow is at 4:30
[2:14:11] siskokid: She knows how to talk on stage
[2:14:22] UggieGaming: is that tracer ? XD
[2:14:22] ocean_sunshine: they've decided to cancel classic plus and release the titan mmo
[2:14:24] 인터넷포트: I meant the Wow Arena world champion
[2:14:41] Spart4nm4n: she looks just like one of the mojang DEVs lydia winters
[2:14:46] Capnrein: wow is cancelled. servers closing!
[2:14:48] 인터넷포트: they used to do wow arena championship live
[2:14:49] Capnrein: lol
[2:14:51] AndroidDream: HEY SWIFTY
[2:14:56] 인터넷포트: but now they do overwatch live
[2:15:03] Capull0Spawn: no mate, its 2 hours later. atleast in EU. right now its 19:28 and we see WoW stuff at 21.30
[2:15:05] Arraben94: wow we gotta wait 2 more hours
[2:15:11] projectthebaby: Without some ultimate warrior tricks for him real quick
[2:15:21] ocean_sunshine: @Arraben94 oh god
[2:15:26] projectthebaby: I hate speech text
[2:15:28] ocean_sunshine: It's already 2:30am for me
[2:15:35] Pallyofhell: i mean the schedule has been up for awhile
[2:15:46] crookqtftw1: They are really selling "the future" :D
[2:15:56] Arraben94: lets riot. no one wants overwatch!
[2:15:59] mrblond5: wow
[2:16:34] delugeonal_grrrraffe: Fast forward button not working
[2:16:36] nosensekid2138: Overwatch in my opinion is doing the same thing CoD is doing making everything in battle pass meta and op to try and force people just to buy it they lost me for that
[2:16:40] Uf0s8mycat: Normally these shows would start with hype. Blizzard instead opted for OW.
[2:16:40] ocean_sunshine: I thought they wanted to end their comp scene cos they were losing money... or is this the last hurrah
[2:16:50] 인터넷포트: Ohhh its not live
[2:16:51] 인터넷포트: no wonder
[2:16:57] 인터넷포트: i thought they was doing games lol
[2:17:18] ocean_sunshine: @nosensekid2138 indeed, the original overwatch system was better - at least you could earn all skins for free
[2:17:29] Cowardpatty: This is a comeback BlizzCon that is light on content, so it makes sense they would save the biggest for last
[2:17:46] Pallyofhell: WoW isnt the last
[2:17:53] 인터넷포트: yup and that crowd sounded really loud for Warcraft
[2:17:53] ThePeachPower: this is just painful, the way they are trying to save OW :/
[2:17:54] ocean_sunshine: .. LE SSERAFIM
[2:17:56] Uf0s8mycat: @Cowardpatty dont have to bore the crowd to death before then tho either.
[2:18:04] 인터넷포트: when they brought up wow the crowd went wild
[2:18:32] ocean_sunshine: OW must be their big profit engine rn, it's their only game with a battle pass right? not sure about diablo
[2:18:35] crookqtftw1: When you can't sell future sell "maybe future" :D
[2:18:40] Pallyofhell: because wow is their biggest community
[2:19:19] twotonehs: read the instructions
[2:19:50] SoldFive: SoldFive subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 21 months, currently on a 21 month streak!

[2:21:05] fabian_cloud: Bro i love overwatch, but lets just be honest, this game has been handled about as poorly as it could be.
[2:21:26] Spart4nm4n: wow is coming to the etch a sketch and samsung smart fridge.
[2:21:42] Uf0s8mycat: This sure does make me miss Jeff
[2:23:52] Cowardpatty: That went dark lol

[3:25:47] PuddingTader: Probably a way to get $50 3 years in a row vs $70 every other year
[3:25:57] kelvimortis: omg ad rn is killing me 2.5 min
[3:25:59] Skrunch__: This doesnt get me hyped for nothin tbh - the gameplay is what matters
[3:26:07] iBoostCSGO: you know they're throwing the kitchen sink at it when they announce 3 expansions in 1, subscription numbers must be bad
[3:26:11] kelvimortis: missing entire 3rd explanation
[3:26:14] elizabethfhansen: @kelvimortis me too

[3:27:35] Spart4nm4n: but i can't come home unless i have a disposable income..
[3:27:37] EvoCyberNation: I tend to hit a barrier, but from what I read, that's a normal thing. Diablo 4 is getting that way. So I need something else to pick up my curiosity. It'll probably be WoW.  lol
[3:27:46] elizabethfhansen: NEED A TRAILER NOW
[3:27:55] Skrunch__: retail where you can gear and get bored in 1 month
[3:28:02] Skrunch__: come on back for 30 days
[3:28:04] EvoCyberNation: It is getting harder to have one, @Spart4nm4n :(

[3:28:45] iBoostCSGO: leme guess, all movie no content
[3:28:55] Galdrena: Please remember not to curse.
[3:28:58] Xaviwan078: GOOD
[3:29:01] EvoCyberNation: Their videos are starting to become more realistic looking. Please do that to the in game graphics! :D

[3:31:34] Nitroreflex: lich king cloak
[3:31:39] EvoCyberNation: That must be one powerful presence
[3:31:43] joofdisciple: Commence gay human orc interracial scene
[3:31:44] Zoram1: awwww

[3:33:14] Xaviwan078: OK ITS GOOD
[3:33:16] Zoram1: I wonder how much do they spend on a cinematic like that
[3:33:18] crookqtftw1: Feels good
[3:33:21] crookqtftw1: :D :D
[3:33:27] casthaneda: i just hate anduin since his first escort quest, so they cant get me with an anduin vid :sadge
[3:33:37] Spart4nm4n: that sword is big... who wields it?

[3:37:18] kelvimortis: tyrande?
[3:37:37] EvoCyberNation: That means, if you pick up a piece of raid gear, you can put it in the bank and the other character can equip it. Verah nice!  :)
[3:37:49] kelvimortis: we'll see it lol
[3:37:56] BoricuaSJ: The videos ate online so u can catch up anything missed

[3:38:13] crookqtftw1: Creative team is good, really good love it <3
[3:38:19] EvoCyberNation: The main character that gets it cannot equip it. You put it in the bank, and the other character equips it.
[3:38:28] EvoCyberNation: Once it's equipped, it's bound to the character.
[3:38:36] B_Rize: this is so bad, all we wanted was classic +

[3:48:07] Deharma: Mage that heal, Priest that tank...what is the point of this vinegret? :(
[3:48:11] Zoram1: but Season of Discovery is going to be about dual classes or multi-spec classes?

[3:48:57] sektumbebra: like frozen slash for warrior xD
[3:49:07] EvoCyberNation: Warlock. Why? They're always pretty OP.
[3:49:43] EvoCyberNation: I want to say Paladin, but they're wishy-washy. I'm use to playing them, but I don't like how the WoW team has a hard time with evening them out.
[3:50:02] Charlelos: Shockadin FTW!
[3:50:42] sektumbebra: you can you attach plywood by glue and attach your projecto then
[3:51:15] GenMysters: A warrior that can heal himself. WHo would have thought.
[3:51:16] EvoCyberNation: That would be pretty OP? Are you able to mix two classes now?
[3:51:24] Zoram1: A Warrior with Blink
[3:51:31] EvoCyberNation: I meant to put a period on the first sentence*
[3:52:32] Sistik123: No Classic Plus :(
[3:52:46] GenMysters: Warrior Priest. Never need a heal again.
[3:52:51] EvoCyberNation: I would do a warrior main and paladin secondary
[3:52:57] Dissuxx: Guild wars had it as well
[3:53:03] Vadagar1: Neverwinter Nights did that also Multiclassing.
[3:53:07] EvoCyberNation: Warlock primary and priest secondary

[3:54:30] Rictofer: use a 'spring toggle' fixing for the gypsum
[3:55:07] madfuzzypants: the 2x4 is the safest way to do it. the gypsum is gonne give out over time. it will drag a hole in the wall
[3:55:10] EvoCyberNation: The private WoW servers were doing two classes
[3:55:11] GenMysters: This is a huge space
[3:55:28] EvoCyberNation: I'm guessing Blizz caught wind of it and knew it was a good idea?
[3:56:04] Legomaniac1m: WoW does a p good idea w/ other mechanisms in their games, tho class balance is w.e
[3:56:12] GenMysters: Those are the ones
[3:56:35] ocean_sunshine: swifty doing dad stuff while talking about WoW, epic
[3:56:41] sReaPer71: get the metal screw in anchor with toggle that comes out they work great hols over 50lb

[4:03:04] Wazzyl: Who knows what the future brings @teagens
[4:03:18] EvoCyberNation: You might have to buy some oil for the bowling floors.
[4:03:31] EvoCyberNation: That's pretty easy to maintain.
[4:04:31] Legomaniac1m: Q: SWIFTY when is the next coffee time??
