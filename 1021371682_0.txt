[0:51:01] Shrapnel_Sponge: the new 9.1 mega dungeon looks awesome though
[0:51:59] Catspaw66: Korayne's first strike is also pretty solid for aoe // dungeon situations
[0:52:03] theoriginalzinng: burrs is single target, korayn is better for m+ imo
[0:52:09] Dagomarus: Yeah true, but once your in progression mode when its live streaming could be a distraction so testing is probably the only time to stream it
[0:53:40] lumaday: you guys doing sales at this point at all?

[1:06:30] Velarn435: Garrosh was the better tactician, Sylvanas's best move was to repeat the lich king...
[1:06:38] raptorstrick: Thrall
[1:07:11] NA_Mus: Rip tanks in this fight LUL
[1:07:39] Nico_vdM: This reminds of 2nd boss in HFC.  Where tanks must run away from players to drop an aoe

[1:16:04] EthicalHermit: should be tied to account data, as in, if you get max on one char, you can buy on another
[1:16:30] Aidler: luckily for me I see games as pure entertainment. I have enough challenges in RL. my time is valuable and I will by any boost I can get.
[1:16:38] magemaster225: lineage mobile?
[1:16:55] NoWaayMan: having an xp boost without maxing out a character first is kinda messed up
[1:16:58] Thoreya: It sounds straight up P2W
[1:17:13] Thoreya: Immediately when the game launches lol. Sketchy design
[1:17:17] Dagomarus: Yeah the crafting boosts is a bad idea
[1:17:48] xhaven: I did..I loved exploring the world and crafting as I go. Really hope this gets taken away
[1:17:50] SatedaTV: Why would any game launch with exp/ crafting boost, they would shorten the game at the start and everyone not just hardcore will run out of things to do after a week.
[1:17:55] Dagomarus: Because thats just taking a hammer to any in game economy
[1:17:57] raldrik: yeah it sounds like a mobile p2w game
[1:18:22] Wildside1177: I won't be buying that game until it comes out. Gotta see how that works first.
[1:19:22] squirmyjay: of course its a p2w game its amazon..
