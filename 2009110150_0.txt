[0:43:51] neftario105: I did the raid last night 🌙 😅
[0:44:03] cyrex172: mornin neft
[0:44:30] neftario105: I win a chest that upgraded me so cool 😎
[0:44:51] neftario105: @cyrex172 morning 🌄
[0:44:52] Sollice: @Molvonos Ahh ok. I played it only for a couple of hours so far and enjoyed it. Seems slower though
[0:44:55] cyrex172: i could never bring myself to try survivors, i know its good, thats what the people say
[0:45:52] Molvonos: @Sollice Yea, it's definitely slower, but once you pick up the first 'big upgrades', you kinda blow through it.  Like, I died at 5 or six minutes twice, then beat the timer consecutively 12 times in a row across the various characters, untill I cranked up the difficulty to 30.
[0:46:08] neftario105: I'm going to lvl my hunter on SoD
[0:46:19] neftario105: When I arrive home
[0:46:27] Sollice: Ahh ok
[0:46:45] Molvonos: Some skills make it kinda stupid, like anything Time related.
[0:46:52] jmalmin: That roadmap... Starting to wonder if we are getting a August release.

[0:47:50] neftario105: WoW roadmap retail and classic is on wowhead
[0:47:52] Molvonos: Halls of Torment annoys me at times.
[0:48:03] Molvonos: Like the burrowing boss in the second area.
[0:48:16] Calphurnious: The main thing I like is that there are actual boss mechanics instead of just being a sponge
[0:48:22] neftario105: SoD next raid is gnomera
[0:48:46] Molvonos: @neftario105 Yep.  BFD, Gnomeregan, Scarlet Monestary, then Karazhan Undercroft.
[0:49:22] neftario105: @molvonos so awesome 👌

[0:59:08] SavageCheez: Bloodsail invasion
[0:59:26] Sollice: It's a .6 patch which we NEVER get. Even if it's just a little bit of content it's content we wouldn't normally have forgotten
[0:59:32] Aidler: people actually think 10.2.6 is hardcore for retail towCopium … I think there is no way
[0:59:34] OviTheGray: that is why blizz should never read comments on wowhead or mmo champion HypeLUL
[0:59:38] Sollice: People should learn to complain less
[1:00:31] UltraKSlaya: I think it is adventure mode with every quest being elite/group quests for retail
[1:00:35] TweektheProphet: They are bringing back tourgast but with leaderboards Kappa
[1:00:59] OviTheGray: harcore retail.. character died? pay 60 Euro and boost another one slootRoll

[1:01:47] gelimarr: Whats on the agenda today?
[1:01:59] Aidler: elite/group quests for retail…. no shot. majority of retail players would hate that
[1:02:02] OviTheGray: @cyrex172 yes..424 ilvl gear and renown 20 with most factions
[1:02:02] PotbellyGoat: Any chance that patch falls on May 5th?
[1:02:14] AzedaNA: Clearly it's Edwin VanCleef's great grandson coming back to avenge him in a new Defias Pirates patch
[1:02:37] so_much_this: Im happy man ... blizz has everything for everyone and the road map looks great
[1:02:43] dracullus: imo 10.2.6 will be something like 10.0.7, pirate content with account wide gear for alts to catch up before S4
[1:02:46] so_much_this: road maps have been a win for blizzard
[1:02:52] Alaquane: HypeCry

[1:05:28] Molvonos: I dont think microsoft has anything to do with it yet
[1:05:33] neftario105: Yo
[1:05:33] Aidler: “can’t release”… maybe they are planning a hardcore version for retail LUL
[1:05:37] Bertinelle: crazy how " you think you do but you dont" turned into all of this

[1:34:59] Vandruis: Ya'll gonna wipe on kelris for sure
[1:35:37] Simply_Ryanari: with the right pet and spec, you can still pump out around 100 dps as a melee hunter...
[1:36:28] starkos7: ya melee hunter is the top hunter spec right now, the hunter in the group might not know how to play it
[1:36:30] Molvonos: 'With the right pet, and right spec, along with the best gear, and all the buffs, you too can do suboptimal dps compared to other specs.'
[1:36:37] Molvonos: towSip
[1:36:37] KroniclyLazy: is there a wowarmory for SoD?
[1:36:50] AzedaNA: I think you should disclose if you're playing a spec like melee hunter. People invite you to groups thinking you're playing a standard performing spec
[1:37:20] Vandruis: Shaman could be using earthshock too

[1:37:50] Molvonos: No Shaman.

[1:45:09] drewetling: feelings
[1:45:12] markedrogue_: We've always 1 tank every boss but Aku'mai
[1:45:19] wEiRdO_dUdE: The tank union won't allow him to continue when DPS pulls a ninja move!
[1:45:21] HaxzorJimDuggan: nope that tank is done for the lockout
[1:45:26] AquaJamz: well he can get into a 5/7 lose out on 1-2 bosses and not care

[1:46:38] Nerendis: People can join, correct. But if they leave they are locked to it
[1:46:39] shale93: if you clear this raid its done
[1:46:40] HaxzorJimDuggan: people can join yes, people that leave are done
[1:46:40] Calibur84: correct
[1:46:42] Civiius: yes
[1:46:55] Ranthyr_: They can but itll bring them up to your compleation status so they miss the first few bosses
[1:47:03] Nerendis: I was more telling chat rofl.
[1:47:06] AquaJamz: ok so if you clear he loses the rest of the kills
[1:47:27] HaxzorJimDuggan: its not like defense makes a difference at this level anyway
[1:47:33] Civiius: It stinks but that helm is bis for alot of melee dps , regardless of the Defense
[1:47:58] chefdejour82: nothing matters really going to be replaced
[1:47:58] Nerendis: @AquaJamz He is locked to Towel's ID. No matter what happens to it. Whether they clear more or not. It is the same ID. So yes, if they clear, his bosses are gone too.
[1:48:14] Nerendis: BTW, I was making coffee. What happened? Ninja?
[1:48:16] ambiotic: man i do not miss loot drama in old wow, what a flashback

[1:48:41] ambiotic: he cant, since your full he cant zone in
[1:48:44] Vandruis: he can't progress further on it
[1:48:47] HaxzorJimDuggan: only 10 per id no matter the group
[1:48:51] Fragglevision: i'd think that most of his raid would not be able to get in
[1:48:51] Civiius: LUL gimped himself
[1:48:52] Nerendis: It is your ID for one. For two it's instance locked so it wouldn't work.
[1:48:55] Fragglevision: you have 9 or 10 possible
[1:48:59] ambiotic: its like that time that method hid in liquids raid so they couldnt progress
[1:49:00] wEiRdO_dUdE: Yeah he missed more chances at good gear
[1:49:10] drewetling: loot whore

[3:14:15] markedrogue_: striking
[3:14:19] markedrogue_: lesser striking
[3:14:26] Molvonos: The good stats go on 2-handers.
[3:14:27] Troggie: +2 dmg?
[3:14:34] Molvonos: Since you don't melee, striking is a waste of materials.

[3:15:11] markedrogue_: its lesser striking
[3:15:12] Troggie: tank would get +2 dmg
[3:15:14] kildruid: damage
[3:15:14] Molvonos: Int, if you have a 2-hander
[3:15:21] mavericks312: tbf you can ignore up until TWW prepatch especially if you don’t play classic
[3:15:21] iKONZ: +3 int to 2-h
[3:15:25] zhr0: @xmaswrldtv Probably DejaCharacterStats Classic or something like that

[3:19:55] Molvonos: Only reason you see more bots in SOD compared to other classic servers, is that we're locked into specific zones.
[3:20:00] Molvonos: Same amount of bots.
[3:20:18] cyb0rg_007: do you believe dragonflight was top tier ?

[3:21:31] Flyer_753: Vanilla Classic was the hardest to do because it was the oldest. It gets easier and easier
[3:21:44] adxx: The new Hero talent trees for A War Within alone have more testing and development than re-releasing classic era expansions does now. lol
[3:21:45] Kelticlore: Towllie weren't they missing some of the classic files
[3:21:46] hammack52: it will stop at WoD classic cause that shit will bomb out bad

[3:23:42] trollinmyimp: Do we have an idea of what the numbers are for classic vs retail?
[3:23:42] adxx: I think there is a pure group of just "Vanilla Era" players, sure. But the rest of the classic playerbase will keep progressing with each xpac
[3:23:48] Davizard: 10.2.6 will come in september?

[3:25:42] trollinmyimp: It's most likely the setup for the War Within. Probably a death of a main character perhaps?

[3:46:52] Jango_: im glad people are excited, but I will be skilling cata
[3:46:59] Jango_: skipping*
[3:47:00] razzieen: What I remember about cata though was that the combat wasn't what people expected even though they cried and demanded slower combat but the raids were also somewhat boring and short.
[3:47:20] AquaJamz: Im stumped on what 3rd toon I should level to 25. So far I have Feral Druid and Hunter. I didnt like Priest in classic/hc, how different is it with runes?
[3:47:29] Osilon33: I need panda classic and then they can stop
[3:47:33] Its_Garix: cata was def played but not as popular from what i remember
