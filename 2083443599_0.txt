[1:08:21] telen46: @nightmoonx11 probably not
[1:08:33] davErosEe: no lol there’s hardly any difference in region besides the very very top, everything else is the same
[1:09:52] BossmanRitz: techn
[1:09:53] Goatsguffle: @cdewx What made you go with Pres over shaman in the finals?
[1:09:54] hellotwice: cdew tell me the counter to dh/destro/healer please
[1:09:54] Moobot: Follow me! https://twitter.com/cdew_wow https://www.youtube.com/tenderloinx1
[1:10:24] Goatsguffle: Gotcha.
[1:10:24] mitchell_xd: Sam made boomy 10x better than it is. The spec is bad imo. Did you guys think about playing double demon or something else towards the end?
[1:10:45] wcolinq: I love playing my hpriest
[1:11:02] BossmanRitz: Isnt Chan technically Australian also?
[1:11:05] Goatsguffle: Nice hearing from top level because watching those games were insane. So many clutch heals, saves, defensives.
[1:11:18] addyz0r: @BossmanRitz yes
[1:11:30] imitatewater: @cdewx i still dont know why they nerfed boomie armor when they were doing those armor nerfs
[1:11:43] Razdruid: @BossmanRitz hes not technically aussie. he is aussie
[1:11:47] xxjagoxx: @cdewx how were you feeling when you won the 2v3?
[1:11:55] Sleepysevenz: the plate change was so awful
[1:11:58] DedlyzTV: do you still love taylor swift? nows your only chance to admir you were wrong
[1:12:01] mitchell_xd: the wand change made up for it @cdewx
[1:12:11] 61775_: man that possum stew tore my stomach up
[1:12:16] BossmanRitz: @Razdruid so is Australia EU? or NA?
[1:12:17] Goatsguffle: we also must remember that chan lives when most other locks don't
[1:12:20] ssjweeaboo: Cdew how come destro locks take grim of sac but don't sac their pet
[1:12:21] wcolinq: How to make healing more fun for low/mid ranked players?
[1:12:35] ChumpSeason: ya what does cdew stand for Kappa
[1:12:45] bynded: you want the talent below it iirc
[1:12:58] Razdruid: @BossmanRitz its NA (kinda) but they have oceanic servers. you can cross realm with aussie servers for content but you cannot cross realm to EU from aussie
[1:13:11] ssjweeaboo: Thank you
[1:13:11] CabinetMistake: chan was like training sam with the felhunter an entire game purging and ccing or something?
[1:13:34] bynded: and it purges yeah
[1:13:39] theodeth: Pres is super fun to watch
[1:13:46] starcities: @wcolinq good question, I tried getting to 1800 in solo queue as resto shaman and it was honestly an awful experience. wasn’t fun at all
[1:14:02] LilDeanix: you guys normally queue tourneys with no socks on?
[1:14:09] izza_cat: cbrew geared?
[1:14:13] minumx: pet purge can be pretty impactful aswell
[1:14:14] Goatsguffle: Yeah i mean gotta remember that the DEWSTER out manaed a resto shaman while playing pres. That was impressive as fufck
[1:14:17] Qdubbz: we despise them too
[1:14:23] proxyr6x: Awc vs echo was the best game I've ever seen. Insane heals bro
[1:14:40] hcrzealot: dewFam dewFam
[1:14:46] CabinetMistake: this next one we 6-0 i can feel it the comeback starts now
[1:14:52] taylorswiffersweeper: @cdewx thoughts on cupid right now?

[1:15:07] DedlyzTV: honestly didnt watch tourney what team did u play in finals?
[1:15:08] starcities: would be cool to be able to ban a class/spec when queuing
[1:15:36] scarr16: @DedlyzTV they beat echo in semi's, then lost to echo in finals after echo won lower bracket
[1:15:55] xxjagoxx: Im so washed. Been glad multiple seasons. This season i cant break 2k on anything
[1:16:21] Spaede: awc was mega sick, rarely its good enough to just put on and chill on the couch but i did for the finals
[1:16:47] Goatsguffle: Seems like DH is really strong right now. Don't know what changed but they seem harder to kill as well.

[1:19:50] whompastyle: What's this I hear that Mez has been on the DH lab putting in work.

[1:44:25] Ronn_Deezy: sam alter right there Kappa
[1:44:34] Owlcopwn: he canceled block
[1:44:36] Owlcopwn: XD
[1:44:41] Brenanners: yeah its a bit low, but you have to consider what his current weigh tis and such @nightmoonx11 i maintain with 1.5k per day at 175 and im healthy
[1:44:42] Owlcopwn: mans trying to be the main character
[1:44:49] nomcarver00: @nightmoonx11 thanks. always appreciate encouragement
[1:45:02] Brenanners: if you compare to a 6 foot male pushing 230 @nightmoonx11 yeah it seems absurd
[1:45:12] nightmoonx11: @cdewx I dont know if youve noticed, but missing fears as priest is something that happens often when im on priest too, even if i seem very close range

[1:45:54] koonakeenay: idk how its still soooo deflated
[1:46:02] koonakeenay: crazy still cant cross 2400
[1:46:17] imitatewater: @Brenanners how do you maintain your weight with only 1.5k per day? this cant be true
[1:46:17] Moobot: Follow me! https://twitter.com/cdew_wow https://www.youtube.com/tenderloinx1
[1:46:28] imitatewater: @Brenanners 1.5k is below maintenance
[1:46:33] Brenanners: i lose about 1lb per week @imitatewater so i guess maintain is a bit of a stretch
[1:46:37] nightmoonx11: @Brenanners and your height is?
[1:46:40] Brenanners: but its comfortable weight loss
[1:46:55] Brenanners: i tell people im 6 foot but im not lol @nightmoonx11
[1:47:04] nightmoonx11: @Brenanners lmao whats ur real
[1:47:05] nightmoonx11: @cdewx Some streamers like Raiku, Tyga, etc think R1 shuffle is equally or even more skill (individually) than R1 3v3. What's your take?
[1:47:07] Owlcopwn: lmao
[1:47:10] Swishinn: nerfkidney 6-0
[1:47:12] Brenanners: 5 11 @nightmoonx11

[1:48:06] BossmanRitz: Climbing in Solo is rough. Its easy to get to your MMR but climbing sometimes you get 2 points for 3 wins
[1:48:13] Synical_ttv: how do you get big renews?
[1:48:21] bignoooodle: LMAOOOOOOOO
[1:48:27] nikthevoker: LMFAO
[1:48:35] Eastr0n: Im curious, how much did latency affect your games for the cross server tourney? @cdewx
[1:48:44] snapcityxo: It sucks being a healer in solo, you can play perfectly and the dps play awful and you go 3-3 over and over
[1:49:04] Swishinn: healer shuffles are a different world compared to dps shuffles
[1:49:08] nightmoonx11: But thats why shuffle is more skilled because you need to adapt to random shit teammates
[1:49:09] EFFSIN: lol
[1:49:12] nikthevoker: yup, 1800-2300ish just feels like a blob LUL
[1:49:22] snapcityxo: dps shuffs so ez

[1:50:23] Brenanners: its easy to pawn off as 6 @nightmoonx11
[1:50:53] imitatewater: @Brenanners im 5'11 too man i always tell 6 hahaha
[1:50:59] starcities: @cdewx do you think going 3-3 as healer should give at least a little rating? I couldn’t climb in like 1600 because it was constant 3 and 3 because of 1 trolling dps while the other dps would go 4-2 and climb
[1:50:59] imitatewater: fuck em
[1:51:14] lmrkz: SUP CHAD don't lmme die
[1:51:22] Brenanners: not the only thing i round up to 6 iykwim @imitatewater :p

[1:51:42] snapcityxo: 100% as a healer you need to get more rating when you 3-3
[1:52:04] What_ln_Tarnation: yep
[1:52:05] privategravy: ya mine has just been 0-6 people I cant possibly win with
