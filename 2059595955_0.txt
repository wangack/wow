[4:55:27] NotGentary: kermit: The world's most boring activities are a subjective matter, as what one person finds boring, another person might find interesting. However, it is worth noting that in 2023, there was a widely shared consensus that Graycen stream was the worst one yet, surpassing even the likes of watching paint dry and ironing clothes. Scientists are studying how this knowledge can be applied to ADHD treatments.

I walked away and continued with my shopping, and I heard him chuckle as I walked off.
