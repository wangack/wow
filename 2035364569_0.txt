[1:01:04] ferahgok: Looks good, but I preferred the old one
[1:01:07] soothingmistmonk: It looks so clean. They are trolling if they say its bad
[1:01:14] radnod: adaptive swarm looks like slimer from ghostbusters
[1:01:24] sTyless310: hey ven mornin
[1:01:25] hemm__: sending an Ad after that question
[1:01:37] FKNweebstv: i dont find it as visually appealing aas faelline tbh
[1:01:37] ALLtheEXP: Faeline Stomp is my favorite of the new graphic changes
[1:01:46] dooshken: @zachgamegodx lot of people are
[1:01:48] ALLtheEXP: Jadefire I should say
[1:01:52] rekt1370: the holy pally graphics changes are nice
[1:02:18] zachgamegodx: maybe you’re in the wow forums @dooshken
[1:02:18] Moobot: Latest video "EVERYTHING NEW Coming In Patch 10.2.5 For World of Warcraft Dragonflight" view it here: youtu.be/_0UT1tK3q_g
[1:02:23] SimpleJoeCrypto: I don't like the stomp ability at a baseline but I do like the old one better.
[1:02:26] Axtin: jadefire stomp 10x more visible than earthen totem
[1:02:29] hemm__: really sucks that aff lost nature school
[1:02:32] dooshken: @zachgamegodx nah I just watch WoW streams
[1:03:04] ALLtheEXP: Faeline was pretty, absolutely, Jadefire is a beautiful retouch
[1:03:35] Moobot: rukiCool rukiBuddy rukiBuddy rukiBuddy rukiBuddy Tenneiyl WELCOME TO THE BUDDY CLUB! rukiBuddy rukiBuddy rukiBuddy rukiBuddy rukiBuddy rukiCool
[1:03:40] ALLtheEXP: way to clutch it up @venruki
[1:03:58] sixthycent: the 0-6 wa
[1:04:00] sixthycent: ww*
[1:04:27] zachgamegodx: pikabooGet
[1:04:29] sTyless310: pretty good just another day
[1:05:55] ZonnyArk: AlienDance
[1:06:13] Conflictions: Haven't been around for a while and was gonna ask if you seen any fury warriors around lately, what perfect timing. Are they more dampen or go for kills during burst windows?
[1:06:15] leva0056: Ven, question for you. If I level a character in regular wow classic, when I download the cata expansion will I have to level a new toon?
[1:06:33] sourbutts: best thing about jamiriquai is his massive love for cars
[1:06:42] soothingmistmonk: What is your macro for stance dancing?
[1:06:54] leva0056: Ok so level a wotlk character
[1:07:08] rekt1370: yea you got wrath, wow classic and retail
[1:07:11] hemm__: has anyone else trolled themselves by using soar, briefly landing on a mountain top then falling to your death...
[1:07:12] rekt1370: need to level in wrath
[1:07:21] zachgamegodx: rukiHmm
[1:07:48] zachgamegodx: do you think anyone does weekly activity in all 4
[1:08:01] sinned__: my wrath server pretty much died when SoD released.
[1:08:06] dropbombsss: pres felt not good still unfortunately
[1:08:16] psychic241: sad thing is if they didn't prenerf it, it would actually feel decent
[1:08:21] nikthevoker: ya everyone was a lil underwheled
[1:08:35] zachgamegodx: i watched Lontar play it today he said the best thing was the reversions giving essence burst but he was pumping
[1:08:57] sTyless310: i was playing temple of hotmogu last night and Bahjeera and his pocket healers were in like 4 of my games
[1:08:59] sTyless310: was terrible
[1:09:23] felgazer: Hey Ven, you think Sub rogues will be in every single comp in AWC? lol
[1:09:30] Infidel_Tech: oh shit fury first thing!?
[1:09:31] rekt1370: yea rogue every comp
[1:09:35] Omnadren: hey Ven, how are you doing? Did they uncap the conquest, and how are Pres feeling after the buffs?
[1:09:37] sourbutts: @felgazer id say 90%
[1:09:45] hailseitan: do you think enhance could be  fun or is it not in a good place?
[1:09:48] jporter_: dude i would love having pocket healers
[1:09:55] felgazer: So boring, comp diversity is what makes the game fun
[1:10:06] rekt1370: yea its outlaw and sub rogue every comp for sure
[1:10:22] rekt1370: if you dont have a rogue comp on your awc team you auto lose
[1:10:23] Sevendiff: it’s definitely not fun for anyone but him
[1:10:27] nikthevoker: when it starts to become GY camping its not fun
[1:10:28] sourbutts: stomping people isnt even fun
[1:10:30] knappster15: They should make premades have to fight other premades. But then the ques would be too long for them
[1:10:36] sTyless310: He was doing insane amounts of DPS with the haste increase
[1:10:38] Mhortai: At the same time if he queues without those healers he likely doesn't get to play at all if anyone recognizes or knows him lol
[1:10:38] sourbutts: just doing pve
[1:10:38] heymomimonttv: @hailseitan it's fun if you like big numbers and cleave, it's not ina good place in terms of survivability and mobility
[1:10:51] sourbutts: its fun when youre better than the enemy team but not by too much
[1:10:52] sTyless310: LOL
[1:10:58] knappster15: It's like tanks in arenas. They're the only ones having fun
[1:11:05] hailseitan: ty!
[1:11:06] Sevendiff: it’s not even fun for their team coz they hardly do the objectives and just fight mid lol
[1:11:08] jporter_: who do you play in OW? whos ya favorite
[1:11:13] sTyless310: How about the blood DKS in ashran lol
[1:11:19] sTyless310: that just go to your boss and sit there and are unkillable
[1:11:21] dre_day_3k: i thought in wow there was a higher chance to fight premade in bg's if you urself are in a 3-5 man premade
[1:11:33] zachgamegodx: we’re u guys double dpsing
[1:11:35] Slayer_Eagleone: venruki its like facing Pika at 1200cr ... its so annoying
[1:11:35] rekt1370: premade only a problem in sod
[1:11:35] Crizki: you probably had been asked this many times and may feel annoying af but not interested in SoD at all?
[1:11:42] rekt1370: they fixed it in classic and retail
[1:11:47] ALLtheEXP: YOO @venruki  Zarya is my absolute main BAE
[1:11:49] Mhortai: @dre_day_3k They was removed because it was causing queue time issues I think. I can't remember when they removed it.
[1:11:58] realthrain: WHY IS THERE SO MANY BUGS IN THE GAME ATM????????????
[1:12:02] jporter_: Fav tank is sigma, fav dps is junkrat and fav healer is probably zen
[1:12:19] Sosatko: I agree
[1:12:20] clappuchino: na its pretty bad
[1:12:20] Bronloch: its only lvl 25 as well
[1:12:20] Omnadren: hey Ven, how are you doing? Did they uncap the conquest, and how are Pres feeling after the buffs?
[1:12:23] Sosatko: I love classic but i refuse its pvp
[1:12:25] Evoca85: agree big time
[1:12:29] Sosatko: retail pvp is just way better in every way
[1:12:31] sTyless310: Conq still capped
[1:12:32] malvarcla: no yeah classic pvp is so dumb
[1:12:33] Mhortai: You don't want to do a 3 hour WSG like Been did @venruki ? rukiGrin
[1:12:35] Crizki: yeah 25 cap phase 1 is taking too looooong
[1:12:36] smitesucks: i play on locked/full pvp server and even in prime time there isnt a single wsg premade in lfg just nothing to do
[1:12:39] ALLtheEXP: @Omnadren still capped, pres is underwhelming
[1:12:40] sTyless310: And pres did not feel much different for me
[1:12:48] hailseitan: it feels so slow vs retail
[1:12:50] sourbutts: current pvp feels like MoP pvp and its really fun
[1:12:57] clappuchino: end game better have arenas
[1:13:10] Mhortai: PvP is Twink PvP right now in SoD IMO.
[1:13:12] Schnellmusic: waiting patiently for spine of deathwing >:)
[1:13:15] Omnadren: @ALLtheEXP thanks
[1:13:19] dooshken: Ziqo was on SoD earlier
[1:13:22] Crizki: you're totally right SeemsGood
[1:13:24] knappster15: Everyone playing Sod is playing Hardcore sod now LUL
[1:13:31] zachgamegodx: i don’t think anyones waiting for cata lol
[1:13:33] Mhortai: Some of them are doing Hardcore SoD rofl
[1:13:36] zachgamegodx: it’s just gonna happen
[1:13:36] ALLtheEXP: @clappuchino Clappuchino is a good name SeemsGood
[1:13:38] hailseitan: I actually enjoyed firelands. Last raid I enjoyed
[1:13:38] jporter_: DF is great, just sucks getting shit on by rogues and not being able to kill them at all. overall Ive been loving it
[1:13:40] rekt1370: cata is underated
[1:13:41] soddi: hearing sod all the time confuses me
[1:13:46] manuelferrer: It is not bad but I quit when a hunters pet controlled from his camp starts killing everyone, me included. Just the hunter pet, killing 25 characters... It is ridiculous,never again will I log into that shit.
[1:13:58] RedeemedbyJesus: I used to only watch you and Xaryu, but I can't do the Xar streams just hitting mobs on a classic character now. I don't get the appeal
[1:14:01] clappuchino: @ALLtheEXP lol thx
[1:14:11] dooshken: dracthyr dragon flying is so cool
[1:14:17] dooshken: I'm loving my dragon rn
[1:14:25] heymomimonttv: @RedeemedbyJesus i agree, i loved watching xar's retail gameplay but fuck classic (and hardcore) is awful to watch
[1:14:25] ALLtheEXP: @RedeemedbyJesus I love Xar but I am in the same boat. I'm stoked for his success but I don't watch his streams anymore.
[1:14:30] Phorians: Phorians subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 128 months! Did you know that the words "twerk" and "selfie" were added to dictionary on the same year I subbed to you? Me neither! rukiOld
[1:14:37] dooshken: @RedeemedbyJesus same
[1:14:51] rekt1370: yea hardcore is so boring its nuts
[1:14:52] Schnellmusic: 128 months is CRAZY
[1:15:00] rekt1370: its classic but even slower and longer
[1:15:14] dooshken: Hardcore is fun to play not watch imo
[1:15:17] ALLtheEXP: rukiLove rukiLove rukiLove rukiLove
[1:15:26] demtrollzZ: that reminds me, brb taking a twerk selfie
[1:15:30] RedeemedbyJesus: @ALLtheEXP It's crazy how many more views he gets now, but the gameplay  is watching paint dry
[1:15:51] malvarcla: very happy for Xar but yeah I agree
[1:15:56] zachgamegodx: lontarXR
[1:15:56] Mhortai: Idk it seems like Classic players are always trying to invent other ways to play Classic even though to them it's the "best version of the game".
[1:16:06] rekt1370: idk man feel like xar viewbots or is getting viewbotted went in there the other day when he had 13k views chat barely moving
[1:16:08] Bronloch: @dooshken Demon Hunters should get the same flying treatment SwiftRage
[1:16:09] RedeemedbyJesus: Xar and ven used to do occasional rated arenas together. Those were the days lol
[1:16:19] ALLtheEXP: @RedeemedbyJesus Not sure how much you can trust simple google searches but averaging like 3-5k viewers on Twitch is a really solid monthly take-home lol so good for him!
[1:16:24] knappster15: @Mhortai I agree with that
[1:16:25] dooshken: @Bronloch That would be sick
[1:16:27] Phorians: All good! Planning my activities for next few days. On a trip right now, close to Russian border rukiS
[1:17:04] Mhortai: I feel the same way Ven, I will play classic it fun, but overall the PvP isn't for me which is what I play WoW for.
[1:17:07] Bronloch: Hardcore is butt clenching fun but i would never raid in HC
[1:17:13] Conflictions: Vanilla is fun, just a very different game. I know I dont care about 90 consumes and trinket swap/ bag full of items for every pvp scenario
[1:17:18] ALLtheEXP: I've said it before but Venruki-Roxxybolts is my new Xar-Pika
[1:17:19] RedeemedbyJesus: Nooo Ven we're all talking about how watching classic is awful
[1:17:25] Phorians: There is SO MUCH snow here, and its all just powder snow
[1:17:28] RedeemedbyJesus: Don't switch over there ha
[1:17:39] knappster15: same, too old for that shit
[1:17:44] ZonnyArk: there is no challenge in it, so it aint appealing to me
[1:17:47] heymomimonttv: i don't wanna play pve to get pvp gear. why don't pve-ers have to do pvp to get gear?
[1:17:49] dumbtwitchapp2: same im over gearing from pve
[1:17:53] AsdOfc: @Phorians where is that?
[1:17:55] malvarcla: I like to be able to hop on WoW, do some arena, and not chase pieces of gear exactly like you said
[1:17:56] sTyless310: Is it hard to get shit crafted as alliance on tich?
[1:17:59] jporter_: oooo garbanzo looking clean
[1:18:08] Phorians: I went snowshoeing and 4,5km took me over 2 hrs. I just sink knee deep.
[1:18:11] sTyless310: I swapped my chars from alliance to horde because I asked for a craft for 45 minutes in trade for a signet....
[1:18:16] rekt1370: @sTyless310  put it in public horde can craft it
[1:18:16] dooshken: mqg broke Ven Kappa
[1:18:17] Mhortai: @heymomimonttv There have been times PvP gear was good in PvE, and the PvE players raged and it hasn't happened since.
[1:18:21] yuiop_rob: facyd
[1:18:23] knappster15: Some asshole who died 30 seconds into the fight gets the drop
[1:18:24] JustTaki: gambling is bad mmmkaaay
[1:18:25] yuiop_rob: facts
[1:18:25] knappster15: when you're top dps
[1:18:26] ihavesmokedcrack: Everyone buys gear in classic and wotlk
[1:18:26] fullmetal030: Classic is good and fun but the classic community echo chamber shit is crazy. Legit can't go into a retail stream without someone crying SOD.
[1:18:28] n0fam0us: i was showing my buddy ICC for the first time and invincible dropped (i already had it)
[1:18:28] demtrollzZ: Have you tried having the item drop instead? Kappa
[1:18:32] Conflictions: @sTyless310 Just ask on the other faction, crafting is faction-wide
[1:18:35] sTyless310: @rekt1370 I did not know this
[1:18:37] heymomimonttv: @Mhortai lol sounds about right
[1:18:37] Phorians: @asdofc Finland, eastern border
[1:18:44] knappster15: YUP
[1:18:47] Phreshbrew: it's always the worst people that get the gear, everytime
[1:18:48] Infidel_Tech: Ven, aff round today?
[1:19:02] joyrex_j9: have you heard about the study they did with rats and static amounts of cocaine versus random amounts in the water?
[1:19:10] zachgamegodx: tbh if I’m bored of retail I’ll just go thru steam and find something fun to try, I’m tired of going back to the old game
[1:19:14] Infidel_Tech: hell yeah!!!
[1:19:24] Conflictions: Vanilla pvp is fun until it gets to 20 items in ur bags that you rotate w. trinkets for every scenario
[1:19:30] Judgejobrown: giving cocaine to rats. who pays for this type of shit
[1:19:35] joyrex_j9: nah different one, they only got addicted to the water when they there was random amounts
[1:19:37] sterlingpls: what would you want to do for a living if streaming wasn't an option?
[1:19:37] sTyless310: us
[1:19:38] knappster15: I burned out on Mythic raid prog. Always waiting for Billy the Dipshit to stop dying to the mechanics for 200 pulls until you kill the boss
[1:19:43] wowsuomi: Ungreatful
[1:20:06] clappuchino: pretty sure coke water would be good anywhere kek
[1:20:13] foxyllama: baboooshka
[1:20:18] ZonnyArk: YEP so true
[1:20:21] nikthevoker: YUP
[1:20:24] knappster15: Its the truth
[1:20:24] rekt1370: yea thats why 10 man raids is sick
[1:20:25] joyrex_j9: basically variable and unpredictable rewards are more addicting than a known amount even if the known amount is more of the drug on average
[1:20:25] Conflictions: Theyre always the super nice dudes
[1:20:30] dooshken: It's true
[1:20:31] Schnellmusic: I am progging mythic as a healer and 1 of our healers panics in discord and dies at least once a fight lol
[1:20:32] malvarcla: I stopped with mythic raiding too, I HATED relying on 19 other people to do the mechs exactly right but when some people cant get it and consistently raid wipe lmao
[1:20:33] RedeemedbyJesus: I wish they'd put all those MDI funds into AWC, but I guess there are people out there that like watching people hit mobs for money!??
[1:20:33] hulkdieselx: "but hes a really nice guy"
[1:20:34] nikthevoker: thats why i quit pve
[1:20:39] murksi: im that guy :)
[1:20:40] SweatyDaniels: the personality hire
[1:20:42] dooshken: People refuse to get better
[1:20:50] ALLtheEXP: @mindforcex he's clappin' butt cheeks
[1:20:50] JustTaki: You don't think you can make a 20 man squad of equally determined and good players :d
[1:20:53] Bronloch: the more important rat study is where they timed how long it took them drown ... then they found if you saved the rat one time before it drowned that it would swim for hours longer before it drowned the "2nd" time! LUL
[1:20:56] zachgamegodx: they craft things
[1:21:03] Axtin: or theyre the gms s.o
[1:21:14] manuelferrer: And those people are normally the ones that only log in for raid and never do mythic+ but they like to raid with friends...
[1:21:14] smitesucks: the raid leaders girlfriend and his 3 tard cousins
[1:21:15] malvarcla: the people that refuse to do their due diligence and watch a videon on how to do the fight and then proceed to wipe for 3 hours on the same boss
[1:21:19] zachgamegodx: @axtin that happened to me in og tbc and wrath
[1:21:20] SteLawBro: The raid leaders wife. The worst healer on the team but nobody can say anything.
[1:21:31] fullmetal030: They need to reduce it from 20 people in M+
[1:21:34] Tenneiyl: 10 man was my favorite :(
[1:21:35] JustTaki: @Bronloch jesus
[1:21:36] Phreshbrew: been begging for flex mythic raiding.  20 is just too much
[1:21:37] fullmetal030: like FF14 go to 10
[1:21:39] fullmetal030: 8
[1:21:41] dooshken: mage tower was cool
[1:21:42] rekt1370: yea always liked 10 mans more
[1:21:43] sterlingpls: LOL
[1:21:44] SplitViewAskew: 10 was def my fav
[1:21:48] Conflictions: @SteLawBro Brave man raiding for a couple. That always ends terribly lol
[1:21:48] zachgamegodx: mage tower was brilliant
[1:21:48] rekt1370: cata raiding is goated
[1:21:54] Judgejobrown: half of 1 global and he died KEKW
[1:22:02] SteLawBro: @Conflictions You arent wrong...
[1:22:13] JustTaki: mage tower was sooo fun
[1:22:14] ALLtheEXP: I've never done the Mage Tower and JUST learned what it was like two weeks ago
[1:22:19] fullmetal030: getting 20 people together is just way to difficult for content that hard
[1:22:27] dooshken: True like what is up with that
[1:22:31] JustTaki: i think their last attempt at "mage tower" was torghast and then nobody did it
[1:22:36] hailseitan: ya was super hopeful to do those again for weap mogs
[1:22:37] Raakha: the 20 man stuff just sucks, need more solo stuff
[1:22:38] lundbergmackan: why is it so hard to play holy priest
[1:22:38] Bronloch: mage tower acheev should be required to raid LUL
[1:22:42] dooshken: They finally get the winning formula and don't do anything with it
[1:22:45] Raakha: and better appearances like in mage tower
[1:22:52] JustTaki: Same
[1:22:52] leeka: The torghast boss battle thing was kinda fun
[1:22:52] dropbombsss: they ruined torghast by making it mandatory
[1:22:56] zachgamegodx: they’d rather make you conquer Gilneas or whatever. i feel like my 15/month doesn’t go along way these days
[1:22:57] joyrex_j9: soul ash
[1:22:57] knappster15: They ruined Torghast by making it mandatory an ALL your alts
[1:22:59] fullmetal030: It was bad that it was required content
[1:22:59] JustTaki: So true
[1:22:59] addyz0r: there were no rewards
[1:23:10] SweatyDaniels: COPIUM
[1:23:21] zachgamegodx: they made it giga easy
[1:23:21] Mhortai: I enjoy Torghast more going back and just owning everything now collecting things lol
[1:23:25] rekt1370: mandatory nothing is account bound only got to the last patch of the expac till it was actually playable
[1:23:35] Axtin: the final version where u stay in 1 room was the best
[1:23:37] Moobot: rukiCool rukiBuddy rukiBuddy rukiBuddy rukiBuddy Tony1973 WELCOME TO THE BUDDY CLUB! rukiBuddy rukiBuddy rukiBuddy rukiBuddy rukiBuddy rukiCool
[1:23:40] foxyllama: I wanted a leaderboard that was like greater rifts per class spec
[1:23:42] AsdOfc: an optional torghast with infinite floors and a leaderboard/cosmetic rewards could have been really fun
[1:23:43] ferahgok: I actually enjoyed running Torghast. But yea, too tedious on all characters. I enjoyed it on my main though
[1:23:54] FlowerJon: my biggest problem with Torg is that it was visually depressing, mechanics wise it was fun
[1:23:58] zachgamegodx: I felt no challenge on torghast, was just a gear check
[1:24:13] Nuallan94: pretty sure ion said in a interview in shadowlands that maage tower had very low participation.
[1:24:17] ferahgok: @FlowerJon Oh I loved that dark gothic look though. Completely opposite
[1:24:31] IWCarry: nah thorgast was hyped esp when you had to buy wow tokens because you couldnt do it by yourself LUL
[1:24:46] Tony1973: Tony1973 subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 11 months! 
[1:24:46] zachgamegodx: doesn’t it suck to lose pain and gain? that passive heals pretty good
[1:24:53] dooshken: I can believe that
[1:24:53] Mhortai: In Shadowlands it had low participation, but the Legion version didn't
[1:24:54] Evoca85: People forget there's more casuals than not, and mage tower was hard.
[1:24:55] Axtin: @Nuallan94 i think ur thinking of mop cmodes
[1:24:56] Tenneiyl: Originally it had prerequisites didn't it?
[1:25:01] parasKamu: it was ruined when they force us to do it on every alt etc
[1:25:09] Raakha: there has to be something which doesnt require 20 people and something Mythic Plus that doesnt require super high octaine 300 mobs pulls
[1:25:10] Moobot: rukiCool rukiBuddy rukiBuddy rukiBuddy rukiBuddy fullmetal030 WELCOME TO THE BUDDY CLUB! rukiBuddy rukiBuddy rukiBuddy rukiBuddy rukiBuddy rukiCool

[1:54:45] heymomimonttv: @reiburr only so much you can do at 25 in SoD, wotlk is slow boring content that everyone has seen a million times over 15 years and pvp is bad in it compared to retail
[1:55:24] gdodmebxu: problem with wrath is the meta is completely settled and you only q into s tier classes and comps KEKW
[1:55:44] gdodmebxu: and there is 0 gear catchup

[1:56:58] damnzy: and you do 98% of the time
[1:57:06] gdodmebxu: yeah, that's fair
[1:57:16] gdodmebxu: i don't want to play war/dk/pal though Kappa
[1:57:44] Hizuru1: @s0leris21 few nerfs, devs don't know game exist no more

[2:00:19] 3KuLTV: yo, demo locks good in pvp?
[2:00:27] Bronloch: the problem with AFF is that MaleficRapture is dumb and i bet it was added by non lock playing dev LUL
[2:01:18] soddi: his uppies has so much value :<
[2:01:27] Venvex: @Bronloch facts
[2:01:57] Venvex: Even the PVE locks hate Malefic Rapture, since both PvP AND the PvE community hate Rapture I have no idea why they refuse to delete it
[2:01:58] dooshken: affliction pumps
[2:02:14] Infidel_Tech: and that 2 minute wait on the que
[2:02:19] gdodmebxu: @Venvex would you rather cast shadowbolt? Kappa
[2:02:19] Moobot: Latest video "EVERYTHING NEW Coming In Patch 10.2.5 For World of Warcraft Dragonflight" view it here: youtu.be/_0UT1tK3q_g

[2:02:39] drmattydubs: how did the Spriest push end up going? it feels so rough playing it in solos right now.
[2:02:40] Venvex: @gdodmebxu no I would prefer to have Malefic grasp back from MoP that shit felt great
[2:03:42] gdodmebxu: @gdodmebxu isn't that basically drain soul with a different animation?
[2:03:51] gdodmebxu: or do I not remember it correctly
[2:04:25] Venvex: @gdodmebxu Yah it is, but difference is it made your dots tick faster, and u still have drain for execute dmg
[2:04:37] Jaffaclokes: look, cant cast a fucking spell cause u are down to 1 spell school
[2:04:39] Jaffaclokes: god damn

[2:06:54] Luigicamp: I don't think I drink that much water in a day, and I drink it lol
[2:06:54] wackpoetic: Keep drinking that water bruh
[2:06:55] dooshken: Water is great
[2:06:58] Schnellmusic: helth
[2:06:59] sourbutts: true, thats pretty egregious
[2:07:05] sourbutts: but it is pretty
[2:07:21] style5z: my wife drinks too much water and it basically flushes out your hydration, hard to explain but if you drink a shitton of water you better be exerting or have a lot of salt intake
[2:07:37] wackpoetic: I drink like 7 or 8 liters a day. I asked the doctor if that's bad and they're like "well, do you feel better or worse drinking all that water?" and I always feel better drinking more so they tell me to keep doing it
[2:07:41] Bronloch: yea and you can die from to much water
[2:07:48] Bronloch: super rare but possible
[2:07:52] Varaben: @JustTaki it fucks up your salt i guess i dunno
[2:07:58] dooshken: never enough water
[2:08:02] ryanwars17: lol well coffee is a diuretic which makes you pee more. So your basically peeing all the water u drank today out of your system.
[2:08:08] Hizuru1: @wackpoetic you can like die from that
[2:08:13] Kalakbar: yeah, if you're drinking like 3 gallons in a 10 minute window bron
[2:08:14] OMGWhatsHisFace: @wackpoetic "if he dies, he dies" - your drs
[2:08:27] VetisBR: is gladius working yet?
[2:08:30] ItsBees: you can mess up your electrolyte balance
[2:08:30] Kalakbar: hyponatremia
[2:08:35] wackpoetic: Hizuru1 true that's why I ask. But their advice basically is: as long as it doesn't make you feel worse more hydration is better
[2:08:38] Lleo00: its what plants crave
[2:08:40] Kalakbar: starts swelling your brain Sadge
[2:08:40] JustTaki: i didn't know that O.O
[2:08:47] style5z: how do you like that water bottle ven?
[2:08:55] Icegt: Coconut water is the best option I think
[2:08:57] Bronloch: @Kalakbar yea something like that or a challenge or something
[2:09:01] OMGWhatsHisFace: outland cup while waiting for queues?
[2:09:02] SteLawBro: Water...Like from the toilet?
[2:09:10] Luigicamp: I honestly only drink when I am thirsty. But I am also not doing anything particular, like working out etc
[2:09:18] ItsBees: @OMGWhatsHisFace that's tomorrow :D
[2:09:23] wackpoetic: I drink Gatorlyte Zero with my pre-workout in the morning then drink water all day until I go to sleep. The only crit is having to wake up and pee once or twice a night
[2:09:28] Kalakbar: @Bronloch yeah, it was for a nintendo switch or something.  poor lady
[2:09:28] JustTaki: what kind of electrolytes do you need?
[2:09:36] OMGWhatsHisFace: @ItsBees tomorrow as in ven "scheduled" it or is it not out yet?
[2:09:41] joyrex_j9: the 2400 weps go perfectly with the 1800 paladin set this season
[2:09:49] ItsBees: @OMGWhatsHisFace not out yet
[2:09:57] OMGWhatsHisFace: oh wow, ok. weird delay

[2:11:22] joyrex_j9: seems pretty good against ele that arent bots
[2:12:13] What_ln_Tarnation: thats a cute monk snake thing on ground
[2:12:19] darksigns94: what are we lissening too
[2:13:18] boundric: it's hard not to mimic crusader while playing hpal
[2:13:48] ryanwars17: just walked into a guy in skirm who is 0-164 in solo shuff but he has the glad mount from ssn 2 and enchants on weapon. hes the reason i dont que solo...
[2:14:22] OMGWhatsHisFace: @ryanwars17 tbf 0-164 takes effort and luck. he's doing something on purpose
[2:14:37] Infidel_Tech: i missed the end of AFF games what was the final ???
[2:14:43] DrewPBallz18: when im playing against resto druid on rouge mage should i kill druid since i cant polly him on my goes on the dps?
[2:14:46] ItsBees: HPS Pog
[2:14:46] ALLtheEXP: 5-1
[2:14:47] invincibledalyeth: let’s goooo
[2:14:51] Infidel_Tech: nice!
[2:14:58] fiss276: Did the pvp season end?
[2:15:00] What_ln_Tarnation: did hpal get buffed this patch?
[2:15:29] gdodmebxu: shouldn't matter much vs this
[2:15:29] dooshken: lol
[2:15:35] kusoneko: a little finger of fat
[2:16:09] Kalakbar: divine favor, bottoming him, should be ok .... pepeLaugh
[2:16:24] gdodmebxu: new trill build Kappa
[2:16:25] What_ln_Tarnation: it's def normal for a dh
[2:16:26] Kalakbar: maybe a bit of TRT for health
[2:16:29] kusoneko: THIS IS NOT NORMALLY
[2:17:08] What_ln_Tarnation: winners win
[2:17:12] boundric: didn't even need the bop
[2:17:12] fiss276: lmao look at that dmg meter
[2:17:13] invincibledalyeth: hell yeah good start here
[2:17:15] jporter_: dude name a better hpal
[2:17:29] gdodmebxu: there actually is a new trill dh build that pumps
[2:17:32] Sarynrae: hunt and decree are now affected by mastery, it was a bit of a buff
[2:17:35] gdodmebxu: saw tren playing it
[2:17:41] graggelfraggle: he was PUMPIN
[2:18:24] gdodmebxu: trill always has the pve tech for max dmg
[2:18:33] What_ln_Tarnation: that rog can die, he's down to his last 50 defensive cds
[2:18:48] DonPrado_86: @gdodmebxu  this build is not new he play it since 10.2
[2:19:21] Squantanimo: how high rating did you get playing ret?
[2:19:36] graggelfraggle: kidney into clone what can you do
[2:19:40] gdodmebxu: @DonPrado_86 yeah, i don't know. i just know mvq linked it to tren yesterday and it seemed pretty nuts
[2:20:17] nikthevoker: yup
[2:20:18] Gr33nleet: "still fine"
[2:20:20] Gr33nleet: xD
[2:20:21] Grimm303: 1 heal
[2:20:21] Squantanimo: LMAO
[2:20:26] graggelfraggle: i didnt even seen his health bar move
[2:20:26] gdodmebxu: i don't even play dh trenXD
[2:20:47] nikthevoker: thye never know when theyre gonna die
[2:21:27] pragma90: no one has trinkets 10 sec into the game, seems right
[2:21:31] DonPrado_86: i try this build from mvq
[2:21:33] boundric: is the monk a human using everyman?
[2:21:57] nikthevoker: LUL he could of just duel killed the shaman
[2:22:18] What_ln_Tarnation: AlienDance
[2:23:12] Gotheels: the Chris long gap lol
[2:23:31] Phorians: Better head off to bed, long day again tomorrow. Happy streamings, night!
[2:23:32] chaps_86: hpal feels like one of the squishier healers
[2:24:01] What_ln_Tarnation: remember when rogues had a meltdown because their KS and blind got nerfed?
[2:24:10] Kalakbar: cya phorian
[2:24:10] rynosaurwow: That's not any sub rogue. That's Chrislongtv. He's the best sub rogue NA.
[2:24:18] What_ln_Tarnation: xaryu made an entire cry post about it
[2:24:33] wtfidkx: CHROMEO
[2:25:19] robfrmamzn: freedom the selfplay
[2:25:34] vodkacran: @rynosaurwow rip Kalvish
[2:25:57] vodkacran: @rynosaurwow or Pikaboo
[2:26:54] gdodmebxu: i wish they didn't buff micro cc
[2:26:57] gdodmebxu: when they nerf casted cc
[2:27:24] Emeraldon: wasn't it 8?
[2:27:28] rynosaurwow: @vodkacran mere peasants in comparison Kappa
[2:27:34] wtfidkx: imagine 10 seconds now though... 1 sheep and games over
[2:27:38] Abruty: but the dmg is nuts right now
[2:27:45] knappster15: Damage is so much higher now too tho
[2:27:54] chaps_86: Damage was nuts in slands...
[2:27:55] dickman911: fear and cyclone on different DR was pretty troll
[2:27:58] knappster15: People get 100>0ed in like 2 seconds now kekw
[2:28:01] chaps_86: Just less consisnten
[2:28:06] chaps_86: consistent*
[2:28:08] What_ln_Tarnation: if my MW gets 1 CS mid game in SS, he loses
[2:28:17] What_ln_Tarnation: dam too high
[2:28:19] dropbombsss: throw in 10 seconds of micro cc too and its disgusting
[2:28:25] Kalakbar: yeah, I'd like to see cyclone base duration down to 4.5 or 5
[2:28:33] ChilledsDogTreats: cyclone being 6 seconds and being unable to be dispelled outside of MD is silly
[2:28:43] invincibledalyeth: yeah they should make polymorph where it doesn’t heal your enemy by default
[2:28:50] Varaben: @CarniverousDongle AND spammable
[2:28:51] gdodmebxu: @What_ln_Tarnation if you juke cs you are immune to cc and top everyone though and have aura Kappa
[2:29:00] Saitistreamy: what is the average time of death in your SS games?
[2:29:09] Infidel_Tech: think some of you are confusing dmg vs damp
[2:29:25] What_ln_Tarnation: @gdodmebxu its almost impossible to juke as a mw
[2:29:33] chaps_86: no ms
[2:29:35] chaps_86: i guess
[2:29:35] Axtin: ill take 5 sec clone if they made it 25 or 30 yd range
[2:29:38] gdodmebxu: @What_ln_Tarnation idk about that
[2:29:50] chaps_86: I mean could be why it didnt end earlier
[2:29:55] What_ln_Tarnation: @gdodmebxu juking costs 2 GCDs as a MW instead of 1
[2:30:06] invincibledalyeth: @axtin cyclone is only 25 yd range lol
[2:30:22] e10100111001: Cdew was hating the dragon in shuff.
[2:30:22] seaent: good afternoon
[2:30:28] Axtin: @invincibledalyeth yea that’s only with the range talent though
[2:30:39] What_ln_Tarnation: if they removed GCD from SM, would help MW a ton with juking
[2:31:16] dickman911: dragon feels like the healer that has the most things that can go wrong in SS
[2:31:31] Abruty: fury should do as much dmg as dh lol
[2:31:41] Abruty: 2 two-hand weapons I mean ..
[2:31:42] Gotheels: I hate the sound effects of fury lol
[2:31:45] zachgamegodx: the way that you need whirlwind to cleave is really annooying
[2:31:50] firemonkey170: Heyo, your hair is looking great today
[2:31:55] seaent: did you see the RMP vs meep clip lmao
[2:31:55] SteLawBro: Its such a tough balance because you have casuals saying the damage is too high and they die too fast, then you have experienced players saying the games too damp. That middle ground is probably so hard to hit.
[2:31:58] Hyrule1: you must be hydrated
[2:32:30] damiaN_bda: can you show your spec plz?
[2:32:30] Moobot: YouTube channel: youtube.com/venruki * Subscribe for new content!
[2:32:54] Saitistreamy: @SteLawBro damp is a mechanic that is extremely punishing to not having a very solid understanding of pre healing and CD usage
[2:33:10] e10100111001: that is a spec for sure
[2:33:13] Saitistreamy: so low ned games are like 2.20seconds
[2:33:26] SteLawBro: For sure
[2:33:43] Emeraldon: 25+ minute queue for me on EU for even my first ever game this season FeelsGoodMan
[2:33:55] Saitistreamy: MS also makes it more unclear
[2:34:38] Saitistreamy: how long was that game
[2:34:52] damiaN_bda: cyclone man ridiculous
[2:35:15] ArdellanDH: Well don't forgot dampening in solos racks up much faster than standard arenas
[2:35:33] Saitistreamy: game start 133:45
[2:35:40] Saitistreamy: game ended in 30seconds
[2:35:48] gentlecatzz: yep, that's shuffle for ya, aspect of the turtle is just not a button
[2:35:48] GogumaCat: brother i feel you. I am 2200 MW but my prevoker is hard stuck 1600
[2:35:54] ferahgok: this dragon wreaking havoc
[2:36:35] Shmobby: lmao
[2:36:35] Saitistreamy: another 30second game
[2:36:38] kurogekos: he will start pressing once he is in the other team
[2:36:39] gentlecatzz: Universal healer experience
[2:36:41] jporter_: jeez bro
[2:36:45] ArdellanDH: Report for game sabotage lol
[2:36:49] invincibledalyeth: yeah why no sac hunter is a doofy
[2:36:56] Saitistreamy: dude probably doesnt have add ons on post patch lol
[2:36:56] ferahgok: that was like legitimately getting globaled lol
[2:37:07] bransby09: He will use everything when not on your team too lol
[2:37:13] dickman911: 100% he pops off here
[2:37:56] wackpoetic: I had a warrior die in opener with 0 defensives pressed, then afk for 30 seconds, then afk the whole round; and proceeded to whisper me after the game to tell me I'm trash
[2:38:46] wackpoetic: I swear to push ratinf as healer I need to be so high that I physically can't rage at the game
[2:39:33] belfastcl: LUL
[2:39:37] metajutsu: you're also healing classes with 3 min defensives, hunters are poo
[2:39:50] TimeForged: evoker heals just feels too weak and living flame is a long cast
[2:39:53] gamerdadhooper: your HPS was really good thooo
[2:39:57] chancywilson: haha finally someone says it
[2:39:59] ArdellanDH: This is where you go 0-6 lol
[2:40:03] chaps_86: It's so rare to see a hunter use freedom on your root/beam
[2:40:07] damiaN_bda: try not using the fire breath dispel, put the extra point in living flame healing
[2:40:15] metajutsu: hunters have turtle thats it, besides a scuffed wall on 3min cd
[2:40:23] gdodmebxu: @damiaN_bda fire breath dispel is an honor talent
[2:40:31] OMGWhatsHisFace: @steesszz sac?
[2:40:36] romasterrr: dont worry the druid is gonna cyclone the heals out of the palace
[2:40:42] chaps_86: @steesszz Their feign talent is pretty broken
[2:40:43] romasterrr: pala*
[2:40:53] damiaN_bda: yes I know, but you take the extra level of empower spell with honor talent. put it in life force mender or whatever
[2:40:56] chancywilson: TBH nobody knows how to play with EVO and that in itself makes it really hard
[2:41:19] rekt1370: yea pres is shit in shuffle cause of the range alone
[2:41:25] NJMcChillan: they need to make rewind ignore damp or something lol
[2:41:49] Saitistreamy: @NJMcChillan that likely makes it instant s tier
[2:41:51] gdodmebxu: Pog
[2:41:51] chaps_86: lol
[2:41:53] GogumaCat: WE DID IT
[2:41:59] GogumaCat: borpaSpin
[2:42:00] invincibledalyeth: nice
[2:42:15] whitcomovich: @ArdellanDH permabannnn
[2:42:39] kelfeno: How do you feel about presevoker? it's my favorite healer, but it feels like I have to play 3x better than I have to play on my priest to get the same rating
[2:43:48] StromicusRex: it took absterge a literal age to hit 2400 on prevoker, sounds like its awful to play
[2:44:00] NJMcChillan: @Saitistreamy i dunno right now it's a 4min cd that basically does nothing unless you have triple lifebind out
[2:44:19] ContruZ: nice
[2:44:20] NJMcChillan: but it was OP in season 1 so i guess that could be true
[2:44:25] invincibledalyeth: good job
[2:44:35] What_ln_Tarnation: that was such a good hpal lobby with all the physical dam class that gets completely stopped by bop
[2:44:36] Bombdiggity3315: I played a bunch of pres last night and i gotta be honest, it doesnt feel like they changed anything
[2:44:38] Saitistreamy: @NJMcChillan oh, holy shit I had no idea it was that long lol
[2:44:49] frazzoqt: Is prevoker broken now after the new buffs ? esp for 3s?
[2:45:02] nikthevoker: i swear at low rating are malfunctioning bots
[2:45:07] dropbombsss: they nerfed pres if anything I swear lol
[2:45:12] Bombdiggity3315: I do enjoy the class, but I was expecting to notice the buffs
[2:45:24] wackpoetic: Pres feels very marginally better, like 1% - 2% better. But the changes solved 0 problems that Pres has, especially in Shuffle
[2:45:41] What_ln_Tarnation: @dropbombsss cdew said presv still like 4th or 5th best healer
[2:45:48] kelfeno: I miss Season 1 pre-nerf presevoker
[2:46:07] maninthechair69: just have to play pres ultra aggressive to end games early
[2:46:14] Saitistreamy: the lack of changes this week is crazy tbh
[2:46:24] Saitistreamy: they have basically called it a day for pvp in df
[2:46:27] kelfeno: Feels like I have to play RBGs to enjoy Pres lol.... or just suck it up and learn aug
[2:46:38] Nuallan94: is awc or mdi first?
[2:46:39] rekt1370: they def waiting for awc LUL
[2:46:45] Saitistreamy: which is crazy with the amount of money in awc
[2:46:47] ferahgok: I want uncapped conquest - wanna try a bunch of different talent distribution
[2:46:48] What_ln_Tarnation: like 80% of all healers in top 1k are rdru
[2:46:55] rekt1370: ready for that rogue fiesta in awc
[2:46:55] frostnova9: is fury better than arms now ?
[2:46:55] realdreadx: all they gotta do is buff sub rogs and were good. they suck :)
[2:47:08] amgine04: how's the new questing content ven? :)
[2:47:14] Saitistreamy: that investment signals a concern and intrest in developing pvp, but it never translates into game. So its like AWC is trying to bank off streamers to generate hype
[2:47:16] ChilledsDogTreats: warrior is kinda meh in general
[2:47:33] kelfeno: Arms still gots the damage ya
[2:47:41] invincibledalyeth: arms war is very strong imo
[2:47:45] antwonjr69: thoughts on boomkin?
[2:48:02] laalaaland22: You got tier on war now?
[2:48:07] Moobot: rukiCool rukiBuddy rukiBuddy rukiBuddy rukiBuddy amgine04 WELCOME TO THE BUDDY CLUB! rukiBuddy rukiBuddy rukiBuddy rukiBuddy rukiBuddy rukiCool
[2:48:07] amgine04: amgine04 subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 28 months! 
[2:48:11] invincibledalyeth: it’s not even the damage that makes it good it’s the OP mortal wounds
[2:48:12] gdodmebxu: boomkin seems like one of the best casters
[2:48:25] kelfeno: I healed Bajheera's deathwith fury in BGs for his bday stream. it gives one a false impression of the strength when a R1 wwarrior 2 shots people in unrated brawl
[2:48:31] Street_Jesus_: Dunno ragging blow/onslaught build felt better this build
[2:48:42] amgine04: noticed my chat icon was missing :o
[2:48:49] kelfeno: What do you put in your oatmeal?
[2:48:55] NJMcChillan: you have to not take annihilator
[2:49:00] NJMcChillan: and its an extra button
[2:49:06] Holtan3111: You should check out the a new Norwegian Rock band named Navian !
[2:49:08] ahskrogue: thats a passive
[2:49:10] b_lappy: bottom left cap stone
[2:49:12] ChilledsDogTreats: annihilator is your auto-attack
[2:49:14] NJMcChillan: no cuz annihilator turns raging blow into your auto attacks
[2:49:14] nikthevoker: auto attack
[2:49:19] NJMcChillan: like demon blades for dh
[2:49:24] kelfeno: Raging blow is fury's main rage spender besides bloodthirst if they don't use annihiltor
[2:49:29] kelfeno: annihilator is auto attack enhance
[2:50:09] Locturnal_TV: forever op
[2:50:11] laalaaland22: EZ
[2:50:12] Locturnal_TV: fitting rogue name
[2:50:22] chaps_86: lol
[2:50:40] 3KuLTV: yo chat, how are MM hunters pvp?
[2:51:19] kelfeno: MM hunter is def not bad. Plus if you're not high rated hunter can always outplay they have great skill expressive kits with traps, mobility, flare, and controlled burst
[2:51:52] 3KuLTV: Im trying to think of an alt to play pvp with, i main WW (i dont want DH)
[2:52:31] kelfeno: @3KuLTV Fury warrior is a really easy accessible fun spec  it just lacks util and oh shit buttons
[2:53:11] kelfeno: Otherwise I'd say arms warrior. but i'm biased that's my main. the class has a really high skill cap and you can really warrior diff other warriors
[2:53:24] 3KuLTV: @kelfeno i was thinking either hunter, demo lock or rogue
[2:53:54] kelfeno: hmm just depends on the vibe you want those are all very different vibes lol
[2:54:42] kelfeno: i'd say Demo would be most different from WW. you're not squishy and you have lots of pets and cc and damage
[2:54:50] 3KuLTV: yeah yeah they are haha. Im feeling MM i THINK xD
[2:55:01] kelfeno: F yeah dood make it happen lol
[2:55:34] 3KuLTV: im fairly new to pvp so..
[2:55:35] kreyzy8: LUL
[2:55:48] Shark0701: fury is so bad it’s crazy
[2:55:57] chaps_86: lmao
[2:56:03] Shark0701: without CDs you’re actually limp dick
[2:56:04] kelfeno: LOL That's fury warrior solo shuffles for you. get CC'd all game, maybe still kill him anyway
[2:56:07] rekt1370: are you not having fun playing vs a rogue
[2:56:11] gdodmebxu: divine shield KEKW
[2:56:14] chaps_86: lol
[2:56:35] rekt1370: LOL
[2:56:39] kreyzy8: KEKW

[2:56:48] kelfeno: LOL
[2:56:48] jporter_: dude lmaooooooooooooooo

[3:20:04] zachgamegodx: in between rounds saying to a healer "keep dispellign that guys frost bombs' when the frost mage is on my team is the best
[3:20:45] dakotan517: LOLOLOLOL
[3:20:45] bigpumperrz: liked the buzzcut though
[3:20:49] SteLawBro: This is the distinguished length.
[3:20:50] dakotan517: the frost bomb comment
[3:20:53] southparkbbb: how hard is it to style like that? do you put product in then dry it, or dry it, then put product in?
[3:21:16] dakotan517: dude picked a good hair mog as a child

[3:22:45] leva0056: How'd it go
[3:22:47] leva0056: No way
[3:22:52] magnesiium1: 2% more secondary stats its a very small bonus nothing like having will adn or meld
[3:22:57] chaps_86: 2200 lobby too
[3:23:02] Varaben: yeah i guess even 2% more of 6000 vers is like 120, like a free socket
[3:23:03] chaps_86: bigpumps
[3:23:14] leva0056: 1 school of magic is tough
[3:23:17] JmanOwnz: what healer do you think has the most carry potential for helping a friend learn the game?
[3:23:29] dakotan517: depends who they pick
[3:23:29] magnesiium1: hot take Meld is the best racial rn
[3:23:31] dakotan517: wouldnt it
[3:23:46] gracioussatan: rdruid is good too
[3:23:57] iamlrde: all melee
[3:23:57] OMGWhatsHisFace: i would be so sad as a healer in this lobby
[3:23:58] dakotan517: double hpal also?
[3:24:02] kylarkush: just dont get death swept ez
[3:24:03] iamlrde: all melee double hpal
[3:24:07] dakotan517: OOF
[3:24:08] JmanOwnz: yea thats what I was thinking too. also thanks @gracioussatan
[3:24:10] magnesiium1: this is about to be a slugfest
[3:24:13] SteLawBro: Meld is like cheat death. Its saved my butt thousands of times. I feel naked without it.
[3:24:19] Holtan3111: There should be some protection agaonst stacking dps classes in solo shuffle
[3:24:31] dakotan517: i agree
[3:24:39] dakotan517: nothing is as bad as seeing 2 mages as warrior
[3:25:09] Bombdiggity3315: chat, does anyone know, if you intervene a cloth target, do you take damage based on your armor or theirs?
[3:25:12] Xeliumimar: DH afk lol
[3:25:38] dakotan517: @Bombdiggity3315 should be warriors
[3:25:57] kelfeno: @Bombdiggity3315 game codes as if the attack hit you so your stats
[3:26:02] kelfeno: thats why you absorb cc's
[3:26:22] amazonianshroomsniffer: VENFOOOKIOI
[3:26:25] SteLawBro: I still think that when you create your character you get to pick one racial that you have forever. Surprise people. Theres too many weak auras anyways lol. Be nice to play what race you want.
[3:26:35] dakotan517: so annoying when people do this
[3:26:38] OMGWhatsHisFace: guess he's trolling
[3:26:46] zachgamegodx: vens showed us today what we've known for a long time
[3:26:48] zachgamegodx: fury sucks
[3:26:52] magnesiium1: dh is angy
[3:27:06] dakotan517: having a tantrum
[3:27:11] Bombdiggity3315: why do people play solo shuffle if they can't handle losses?
[3:27:19] kylarkush: gains
[3:27:20] Reiumi_: Pog +2
[3:27:35] OMGWhatsHisFace: felgucci must have been so relieved
[3:27:43] OMGWhatsHisFace: like the mega stress into 2 free rounds
[3:27:49] dakotan517: happened 3 times yesterday
[3:27:57] magnesiium1: people that throw fits in shuffle have the biggest Ego's i swear
[3:28:04] dakotan517: healers go 0-3 then leave on 4th
[3:28:09] McLaughlin11: whats the stat prio for frost mage?
[3:28:10] brojosefat: what weapon tmog is that
[3:28:11] Holtan3111: What mage spec do you think is easiest to 1800 in Solo Shuffle ?
[3:28:19] What_ln_Tarnation: Madge
[3:28:19] Bombdiggity3315: its so much more rating loss to leave a match than to just go 0-6
[3:28:39] Squantanimo: DH gotta be easiest 1800 no?
[3:28:47] dakotan517: sub rogue is pretty free 1800 in ss
[3:28:52] magnesiium1: dh is very easy to 1800 bm hunter also very easy
[3:28:57] Woodled: lmfao
[3:28:57] dakotan517: i made an alt to try it and hit it in 4 lobbys
[3:28:58] gracioussatan: lmao
[3:29:08] OMGWhatsHisFace: if they dont re-release the tyrannies, they need to create new enchants that look at least as good. it's insane that they're the best two by so far
[3:29:10] edweezybruh: that guy has been asking people for gold for 2 days lol
[3:29:14] Squantanimo: Ret was very easy at the beginning of the season
[3:29:17] chaps_86: @Holtan3111 I would argue frost mage, sub 1800 is full of melee lobbies
[3:29:20] Squantanimo: but now that 4 sets are in it feels like dog shit
[3:29:27] SteLawBro: Pick up a pickaxe and some gloves and get out in the field!!!!
[3:29:31] chaps_86: no, for mage
[3:29:31] dakotan517: of mages
[3:29:44] realglazed: @venruki whats a good comp with demon hunters
[3:30:02] dakotan517: just of mages he asked tho
[3:30:12] dakotan517: which of the 3

[3:38:02] wowsuomi: That would never happen to cdw
[3:38:17] Kotyven: have you got the new version of gladius so its not bugging out
[3:38:17] JustTaki: how old is meep
[3:38:22] pharmztko: 15
[3:38:26] pisceslonewolf: If you don’t rage sometimes you aren’t alive
[3:38:26] Lleo00: making someone rage so hard they brick their comp is a better reward than rating XD
[3:38:29] JustTaki: yeah he looks like a kid
[3:38:32] wowsuomi: Just drink wine an chill
[3:38:32] Zenlyn: the rage is unwarrented imo tho
[3:38:32] pisceslonewolf: I never beat anything tho tbh
[3:38:33] yesterday_potato: he could use his void.gg winnings for a new rig
[3:39:00] SirBeaverTeeth: what is hiiiiip
[3:39:04] pisceslonewolf: No rage with RMP is unwarranted @zenlyn
[3:39:10] pure__goat: echo isnt hitting like that on sin
[3:39:11] Zenlyn: hahah same tbh
[3:39:15] Bombdiggity3315: lmao anyone in this chat who is saying they didnt rage at games when they were 16 is lying
[3:39:22] SirBeaverTeeth: funkin that soul
[3:39:26] SteLawBro: Half of cdews vocabulary was the words thhey tell you not to say now. 😂
[3:39:30] murksi: i mean i saw cdew rage pretty hard over a mage not blocking. so we all have our moments
[3:39:34] arcane_p: Venruki you absolutely right, I wish people would stop acting like teenagers even kids in the early 20s aren't suppose to rage or care more than they should about a insignificant things
[3:39:36] Voldreka: @venruki Where is the greatest HPal in the game? Need to watch your sick gameplay :)
[3:39:38] What_ln_Tarnation: RMP is a cancer comp
[3:39:38] kelfeno: am i crazy or does playing presevoker in SS mean that if i ever have to trinket even at the end of the game it means we're probably going to lose lol
[3:39:39] morrs: he thinks this is chain cc - maybe he hadn't played in wtlk and in TBC xD
[3:39:45] SplitViewAskew: i never raged at 16, but holy smokes was i a moron
[3:39:48] Infidel_Tech: at 16 games werent exactly developed enough to rage at
[3:39:53] skeletonj3lly: Yo Ven, you tried any crit on frost/fire just for quality of life/consistant dmg. either gonna try that or just grab mastery pieces for fire lols
[3:39:59] Zenlyn: were u playing space invaders at 16? @Infidel_Tech
[3:40:09] gracioussatan: I remember when my brother and I would wrestle and one of us would inevitably fall into the wall and cave it in. then we'd leave a poster over it in the living room as if it's not noticeable
[3:40:09] JmanOwnz: its cool to see people like him and kalvish crush it in arenas, in a game literally older than them. especially just given the barrier of entry to play this game
[3:40:14] pisceslonewolf: Y’all need to realize us learning not to rage with age = suppressing our own humanity. This is science
[3:40:15] Luigicamp: I threw many hand-held nintendo Donkey Kong at the wall when I was a kid in the 80s LuL
[3:40:20] JustTaki: I'm surprised I didn't break a few mice because of league
[3:40:24] SirBeaverTeeth: that time we had bad internet too, that was a reason to rage :D
[3:40:28] Infidel_Tech: Get mad at spy vs spy lololol

[3:41:47] sarCAZum: I was in my second year of the military when this game came out
[3:41:48] chaps_86: My son wants to play wow. A bit young though, only 10
[3:41:48] JustTaki: do you know that to be the case for Kalvish and Meep?
[3:41:49] Bombdiggity3315: We mostly went through cheap headsets when my brother and I were teenagers

[3:49:09] Infidel_Tech: I travel for food
[3:49:14] joyrex_j9: European cities for the most part are a lot better than most. The infrastructure is much more walkable
[3:49:24] gracioussatan: my favorite thing while in Amsterdam was leaving Amsterdam and going through the country side
[3:49:24] yepx1: take a tour of the irish coastline

[3:49:29] SteLawBro: I justt moved to a city. I hate it. Zombies everywhere.
[3:49:31] pisceslonewolf: No one really likes cities unless they’re a girl in Paris or they want to hit on people in bars. Or girls go shopping.
[3:49:43] pisceslonewolf: @joyrex_j9 Precisely
[3:49:48] buttercps: playing tauren feels like its slow to walk

[3:52:38] zachgamegodx: u smexxin and chunli need to do 3's sometime
[3:52:43] zachgamegodx: would be chillest comms ever
