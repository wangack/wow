[0:50:14] wakkaking: lvl 40 looking good for shamans guess we only need to wait for the runes to see how they stand
[0:50:47] saund: @wakkaking kind of a contradicting statement then
[0:51:23] wakkaking: well we are missing our core spells chain lightinng and chain heal
[0:52:30] saund: yea true in terms of base spells you get a lot, but other classes do too, and maybe shaman runes will be bad
[0:52:56] saund: well all class apart from paladins i guess
[0:53:06] saund: also boomkin doesn't get a lot
[0:53:52] wakkaking: shadow prist and shamans are missing the most things what makes the class valuable
[0:54:35] saund: yea shadow gets its form which is huge
[0:54:36] TruckerOnAcid: hi lmgd
[0:54:46] saund: boomkin too but it's only good for pvp, armor and crit
[0:54:59] saund: but some might say travel form is most valuable anyway
[0:55:07] wakkaking: yeah i guess
[0:55:39] saund: when does shaman get insta wolf?
[0:56:00] TrebekTv: its talents
[0:56:05] TrebekTv: in enhance i think
[0:56:45] zhoode: I think its 1s cast still with talents

[1:15:40] saund: they just 1 shot you and oom your healers
[1:15:43] saund: overtime
[1:15:48] saund: its too much to heal

[1:16:05] icnivadoelx: just afk to save time bro
[1:16:10] ama__deus: @saund I'm mostly calling it a meme comp, because most people who play it are dogs getting carried by it Shrugeg
[1:16:34] saund: bro its 25, every comp is getting carried by their classes LuL @ama__deus
[1:17:00] ama__deus: I mean, they're losing with their comp, which kind of makes my point for me LUL
[1:17:02] saund: if they know how to do a little bit of pvp they'll win
[1:17:38] saund: yeain this case it's just shit players overextending
[1:17:59] ama__deus: Most boomy groups are like that, because of what I said earlier LUL
[1:18:41] saund: different experience then, cause i went like 35-2 in total with my boomy premades
[1:18:52] saund: but we faced a lot of hunter stacks
[1:19:06] heyooh13: lone wolf players are so baaad :D
[1:19:38] saund: i mean boomie comps can literally rot you from half the map
[1:19:45] saund: if they manage to win mid fight they're really bad
