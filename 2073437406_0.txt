[0:47:11] NovaSun84: great, now we're geting nerfed like ret pallies.  PepeHiss
[0:47:15] demondogx7: is full eye beam spec anygood atm
[0:47:38] Yimbus737: do you still do mog ratings?
[0:47:43] Vigi9413: do you play cleanse by flame with it?
[0:47:44] OryWoW: I thihk both dh builds are viable
[0:47:56] Yimbus737: Bobbybigbuns on Draenor EU
[0:47:57] Datguyjay: both good, but each has a situation that makes it better than the other
[0:47:59] milkytherskhero: wussup ven!
[0:48:04] notoriousztv: i think immo build is better for cleansed by flame vs mages etc? i might be wrong tho
[0:48:09] Peachxp_: have you spoke on why u think blizz is just refusing to do changes?
[0:48:44] Datguyjay: awc and the war within is this year lol
[0:48:45] Badasti: I wish they felt that way before the prev awc session when they made the stat changes
[0:48:51] ferahgok: shaking it up would probably lead to more interesting and unpredictable games tbh. would be more fun to watch people experiment on the fly
[0:49:01] endiscope: to be fair DH should have been changed before AWC, they were already quite ahead
[0:49:08] What_ln_Tarnation: its true tho, the entire playerbase is more important than awc
[0:49:12] P1otTw1st: u can change ur gems to mastery/haste instead of mastery/vers, should help a bit
[0:49:18] chizzad52: I think for the first time ever we dont know who will win
[0:49:20] Ribastur0075: more open than before yes
[0:49:26] chizzad52: all the top teams had huge weaknesses
[0:49:30] Datguyjay: doubt anyone can even name the comp that will win LUL
[0:49:37] OryWoW: Saw chan lontar and whaazz qing on NA last night
[0:49:42] wesabae: has rating inflation been fixed yet? I basically stopped this season and just did M+
[0:49:54] Shcottaye: @Datguyjay Destro/DH/Rsham
[0:49:55] Yimbus737: they only lost to the move in the first finals
[0:49:56] nameyourform: kaskas FW team
[0:49:57] nameyourform: lol
[0:49:59] IrishEthics: i only see them lose when one of them makes a big mistake
[0:50:02] dadb00dy: You think solo or rbgs is the best way to farm conquest?
[0:50:08] NovaSun84: Playing with Trill is a visual treat.  He's insane
[0:50:11] nightmxz: I really think liquid has the best shot just because cdew's prevoker and rsham are so good into the meta / counter picking
[0:50:11] Wootzu: ret/war/fist beats them
[0:50:30] chizzad52: I dont care that DH is that OP whatever new season new OP class. I wish MMR was better.
[0:50:35] What_ln_Tarnation: @Wootzu they said they not playing that comp vs that
[0:50:36] nikthevoker: they were beating them
[0:50:39] nightmxz: Never gonna count out the move or echo though
[0:50:43] Shcottaye: Is Bankmw in the tournament? He would fist
[0:50:47] nameyourform: liquid masterminds combing the two best dps classes on one team, genius!
[0:50:55] Wootzu: @What_ln_Tarnation i know, just saying what beating them
[0:50:57] Texdizzle: im not saying reign from above is meta but damn fel lance absolutely pumps its my top 3 damage ability everytime i run it
[0:51:04] nikthevoker: liquid wasnt consitent but they were beating FW/ret/war
[0:51:18] What_ln_Tarnation: rain from above under rated imo
[0:51:22] NovaSun84: the best players are rogue, but rogues aren't the best players.  PepoThink
[0:51:39] chizzad52: Its a good defensive
[0:51:40] taruninja88: wats ur favorite healer
[0:51:45] Texdizzle: its 100k per hit ranged i use it when rooted or about to die usually glimpse into it for 35% reduc
[0:51:45] OryWoW: rain from above was only good pre nerf imo
[0:51:49] What_ln_Tarnation: rain is also basically a bubble for them if they playing vs 2 melees
[0:52:04] Vigi9413: tried the immo aura build... and that damage is nutty
[0:52:05] hawgcast: has rogue DH ever been a comp??? or is it just using best specs like double outlaw in SL LOL
[0:52:06] Texdizzle: i think you underestimate how hard it hits
[0:52:11] Texdizzle: per hit 100k
[0:52:19] Tykzo: never seen them die?  play in 1500-1700 mmr, they die easily there :D
[0:52:20] wackpoetic: ya if it's double melee, then the DH isn't trapped in there with them... they're trapped in there with the DH
[0:52:35] NovaSun84: that's free aoe healing time because he's not pressing other buttons
[0:52:37] demondogx7: im gonna try this build you sent me
[0:52:42] Shcottaye: Nah rain from above is 99% of the time the reason they die too
[0:52:43] jporter_: @Texdizzle good players just line it and it lets them recover
[0:52:53] FlyFYI: dont think ive ever been killed by fly from above lmao
[0:53:05] shad3dspectr3: looks right to me
[0:53:09] Prplneon: Fort
[0:53:12] FlyFYI: just sit there and laugh and thank goodness hes not on me doing 300k dps
[0:53:17] demondogx7: have you tried the eye beam spec ?
[0:53:32] potkopvp: its actually pretty good against double melee
[0:53:38] potkopvp: would never play it against an ele tho
[0:53:49] potkopvp: you'd just get swatted off the sky
[0:53:52] p1peh: Hi ven i follow you since the complexity gaming times, I lost your track in pandaria glad to find you again hope ur doin fine
[0:54:00] demondogx7: anyone got a link for a full eyebeam spec so i can try that aswell
[0:54:31] cyborg1141: Hard one to heal
[0:54:40] Texdizzle: lol this hps tho
[0:54:45] Shcottaye: DH is just never the kill target though, they don't need a "melee" immunity. That pvp talent is better spent just passively doing more damage or removing cc
[0:55:02] cyborg1141: Teams slapping though
[0:55:20] potkopvp: @Shcottaye true, i mostly used in bfa against melee teams in 2s
[0:55:27] tritonxlol: ripp
[0:55:31] What_ln_Tarnation: feelin the owen ele angle
[0:55:32] bigpumperrz: tremor not on his bar
[0:55:34] jporter_: beefyballs tremors those 100% of the time
[0:55:38] shogun2022: thats the life of a healer I guess
[0:55:39] wesabae: you did everything you could've done
[0:55:53] Vigi9413: nothing you can do there if your team can't help you
[0:55:55] P1otTw1st: that ele did 0 dmg LOL
[0:55:58] ohgiddy: buff disc priest
[0:55:59] cyborg1141: Fun ele lobby lol
[0:56:03] Shcottaye: You needed to just Heal more, at least that's what my solo shuffle dps coaches tell me
[0:58:07] shad3dspectr3: quick trink trade
[0:58:21] BMaStream: DH has Blur keybound to Ctrl + P prob

[0:58:28] eqi1: how do shuffle work, is there only 1 out of 6 players who wins the lobby ? or is it devided into best healer and best dps or something else ?
[0:58:37] bigpumperrz: HAhA
[0:58:38] DecocoTv: What mmr is this?
[0:58:40] fieryeyez317: lol

[0:58:45] What_ln_Tarnation: 6:0 war angle
[0:58:46] unsccessful: glad to see this doesnt only happen to me!
[0:58:50] nickc2122: why do people don't press buttons :(
[0:58:52] Ak3rf3ldt: Why even bother to zone when already dead
[0:58:57] shogun2022: better than I could heal at
[0:59:09] shogun2022: I dont even want to try healing this season
[0:59:10] nightmxz: oh no the other healer is 50 below :( sorry man...
[0:59:21] Kujo_XX: I wish we could see the correlation between ban rate and the introduction of SS
[0:59:32] ryanblue98: @eqi1 who ever gets over 4 wins which is multiple people gains rating 3 is break even less then 3  is down in rating
[0:59:36] shad3dspectr3: LMFAO
[0:59:40] What_ln_Tarnation: lol
[0:59:43] hcrzealot: Welp, we carry on!

[0:59:49] hadokaftw: sup sup
[0:59:50] Ultramagnus85: thats exactly how I feel
[0:59:50] cyborg1141: So it doesn't just happen to me
[0:59:50] doo_dahh: tell the shaman to remember to tremor
[0:59:53] Topher45: welcome to healing solo shuffle where people dont press their buttons
[0:59:57] eqi1: @ryanblue98  thank you
[0:59:58] Ultramagnus85: that reaction, everytime I try healing on preservation
[1:00:00] nikthevoker: doesnt stop hex either
[1:00:01] Kujo_XX: They've created such a toxic environment and I find it hard to believe there isn't a bunch who don't handle it well.
[1:00:04] shad3dspectr3: classic disc priest experience
[1:00:12] BigPlekPlek: fort
[1:00:27] shogun2022: ss has encouraged a little bit more of a mongo playstyle for sure
[1:00:30] ohgiddy: reason no one wants to heal shuffle üòÇ it‚Äôs a waste of time bc we gain nothing
[1:00:43] shogun2022: people focus solely on dmg and forget about the rest of their buttons
[1:00:44] potkopvp: no fort NotLikeThis
[1:01:05] nameyourform: PRESS FORT!!
[1:01:14] Kujo_XX: @shogun2022 Cause the best way to win sub 1800 is to find the weakest player in the lobby and mongo it to death every round
[1:01:28] cyborg1141: Not fort buffed ?
[1:02:43] shad3dspectr3: LMAOOO
[1:02:44] potkopvp: you never had it though NotLikeThis
[1:02:51] wackpoetic: fort diff Sadge

[1:03:47] cyborg1141: I feel like I get the same lobby a lot on sham not why I'm bad, but doesn't help
[1:03:54] dougzee23: @ohgiddy solo shuffle sucks for healer sth, if first round u lose cuz the dps in your team did'nt press any press any defense. And u know that dps will not let that happen again. but that is when he's not in your team
[1:03:57] SamusWRLD: @venruki Do you think it'd be worth to run 2 set on Frost mage in Soloshuffle to set up those big Glacials for easier kill setups ? i'm really struggling to climb past 2k
[1:04:20] snapcityxo: healing solo is tough sometimes
[1:04:24] potkopvp: being any caster against all melees is awful time
[1:04:30] driftwood_tc: Hey Ven you ever play boomie? Dont think I've seen you play it.
[1:04:33] Bronloch: like Supa going 1-11 on HPally the other day :(
[1:04:38] justjoshingyo: @potkopvp not as a mage
[1:04:41] Ultramagnus85: dev is easy to climb on

[1:04:56] Saitistreamy: do you think any casters preffers an all melee lobby to a + 1 caster lobby?
[1:05:02] hadokaftw: Hard as shadow priest, im tired que 40 minuts for 3 melees lobby

[1:31:19] Shaengus: i was afraid of that, haha. thanks dude
[1:31:25] nightmxz: dh / warr / lock / boomy would be the best?

[1:31:45] Locturnal_TV: outlaw dh or boomy prob your best third
[1:32:00] Shaengus: i can play dh and keen to learn boomy
[1:32:03] Shaengus: i think im too boomer for outlaw though
[1:32:35] Shaengus: the ele sham is pretty not fantastic at pvp and needs hella peels all the time so maybe a spammable cc guy would be good

[3:57:00] wackpoetic: I know it's FOTM right now and a lot of people hate on it, but DH requires a lot to play. You need to spend talent points, equip gear, and accept queue before you'll ever 6-0 a lobby

[5:23:48] Kujo_XX: Prime example of why I cancelled sub, this mode, the game, and their disregard for the problems isn't worth endorsing. Even with the measly $.50/day the sub costs. I get more value and satisfaction out of my HBO Max sub at the same cost even though I never watch HBO Max.......
[5:23:50] notoriousztv: BIG DAMMMM

[5:28:04] vmills: no one with your game knowledge and experience should be able to go 3-3 maybe 4-2 in a solo shuffle. this is clear proof FW is op!!! lololol
[5:28:20] krisdahaka: and if you think that your decisions are bad guys, just remember that someone actually approved this design of  monk

[5:29:17] chookitywow: whats best way to counter fistweaver?
[5:30:03] joyrex_j9: much cc
[5:30:11] driftwood_tc: @chookitywow spread out
[5:30:33] skylightxo: I think wow has too few abilities, it should have additional 15 classes and 30+ abilities more than now. I hope it becomes THE hardest game out there
[5:30:40] xGriefxGodx: I'm going to light a candle for rdruids
[5:31:10] What_ln_Tarnation: that poor rdru only went 3:3 lets open a gofundme for him

[5:33:08] CatnipEvergreen: got any advice for dealing with solo queue anxiety?
[5:34:03] dimitridq: rely on your cc a lot more than usual and youll feel better
[5:34:09] jimmymaciii: Disable chat in shuffle works as well.
[5:34:11] bapsspe: but then I‚Äôd just be bad on two toons instead of one üòÇ
[5:34:16] CatnipEvergreen: I‚Äôm an altoholic so works for me XD
[5:34:28] dimitridq: and learn to cc peoples goes rather than kill set ups if you die a lot
[5:34:37] What_ln_Tarnation: @jimmymaciii you need to see call outs tho
[5:35:00] brewsome34: haste is fine as caster in solo shuffle i think
[5:35:04] brewsome34: rarely run out of mana
[5:35:08] dimitridq: mastery is much better
[5:35:12] dimitridq: want them big amp heals
[5:35:31] Blastmindx: whenever i fight double melee with an FW healing me in shuffle as spriest im scared the entire game

[5:41:13] What_ln_Tarnation: you know why :)
[5:41:20] krisdahaka: he's disappointed by fw
[5:42:27] tomzartheravenlord: Do crafted items with embelishments really matter in pvp or not
[5:42:46] clicket: next you're gonna say dh isn't that bad
[5:42:49] aragarde: i thought you said the other day that you hated fistweaver tho
[5:42:55] Anubitetv: @tomzartheravenlord yes
[5:42:56] shad3dspectr3: LMFAO

[5:45:12] CatnipEvergreen: as a relatively newer pvp player, why do people complain about fistweavers? is it the damage?
[5:45:45] Nateypww: I would love to see some 3v3 ret/war/fw up to rank 1

[5:46:45] nameyourform: Opressive af

[5:47:27] What_ln_Tarnation: cdew was saying literally 1 caster in other team destroys fw
[5:47:40] Sonovabeech: Solo lobbies afteer 1800 are just obnoxious
[5:47:59] Bronloch: that pally tmog Kreygasm
[5:48:06] CatnipEvergreen: 1800 is the tmog appearance right?

[5:48:44] dadb00dy: I was doing some wpvp out in azure, and these guys 4v1 ganked me. Then the frost mage laughed. I spawned, he was by himself and i killed him then laughed at him back. It felt good. i was playing arcane mage

[5:51:28] Robohobbo: hey man I dont pvp but I really like your youtube content

[5:51:53] uninspire: Ven what would you say is the hardest healer to play at peak level? not BEST but HARDEST?

[5:54:43] krome2dadome: good morning retribuki
[5:54:47] joyrex_j9: absterge was playing it the other day and making it work but he's a god
[5:54:51] Bronloch: BRUTAL
[5:54:54] lefteemd: ive come to terms today this game is fucking doomed man. just overall. it's doomed.
[5:55:00] uninspire: bro the second you sac'd i KNEW you were dead to that DH, he INSTA backflipped
[5:55:03] uninspire: he saw blood
[5:55:09] shugguls: dam that was so smooth too
[5:55:11] Blastmindx: DH moment
[5:55:14] Blastmindx: for sure
[5:55:18] account4turbonoadz: @lefteemd pvp pretty mcuh yea pve feels like its the same shit its always been
[5:55:37] Taevenx: oof, Ret/Holy lobby
[5:55:51] csf109: its honestly so frustrating. I understand some spec/classes counter others but DH is just so dumb to play against for everyone
[5:56:11] Blastmindx: I shoulda made my alt a DH instead of arcane
[5:56:56] allforgold: hpally is so hard to break 1600 for me
[5:56:57] frost4mournee: I‚Äôm started to play and learns rotation for sub rogue it‚Äôs very hard and I‚Äôm tired already of it, maybe I should to switch to dh kekw
[5:57:13] xGriefxGodx: Unhealable healing, I need to get my Retribuki's Deliverance off, BIG DAM.
[5:57:26] account4turbonoadz: ya you should 1/1000 wow players that play rogue effect the enemy healthbar
[5:57:30] CatnipEvergreen: demon hunters are so cringe‚Ä¶ maybe I should play one KEKW
[5:57:35] account4turbonoadz: dh you just 50% everyone
[5:57:49] Blastmindx: @CatnipEvergreen my thoughts exactly
[5:57:52] shad3dspectr3: KEKW
[5:57:52] krome2dadome: :)
[5:57:55] vanlonja: @venruki It this point, I think the only reason they buffed stamina was because DHs were oneshooting too hard LUL
[5:57:59] Bronloch: DH obliterated
[5:58:01] frost4mournee: ik but he is so simple with rotation
[5:58:06] galdinator: see? they die in stuns
[5:58:08] galdinator: Kappa
[5:58:10] frost4mournee: it‚Äôs boring
[5:58:12] Airitreya: made me smile too
[5:58:15] emergencxyz: Buff DH
[5:58:20] CatnipEvergreen: what do demon hunters have for defensive anyway other than blur? anything?
[5:58:20] lefteemd: this is what this game is now it blows
[5:58:20] samo_urbano: hey peeps - will there be any tuning this century?

[5:58:31] tomzartheravenlord: @CatnipEvergreen Darkness
[5:58:48] Blastmindx: Darkness & vengeful retreat
[5:58:54] Blastmindx: And Netherwalk
[5:59:07] Airitreya: oh and 140% passive movespeed
[5:59:13] Blastmindx: yeah that too
[5:59:19] joyrex_j9: the iframes on their shit is probably one of the most annoying parts of the kit
[5:59:28] Stabigale: how would you gear up right now, are honor greens enough or do you need a hard carry for conquest gear
[5:59:28] CatnipEvergreen: THEY HAVE IFRAMES???
[5:59:32] CatnipEvergreen: whack
[5:59:34] buffnac: anyone else that uses teea nameplate totems have problems with it not showing static or healing stream in arena?
[5:59:36] Blastmindx: they do yeah
[5:59:46] Blastmindx: in meta and vengeful retreat and i think aldo blade dance
[5:59:52] galdinator: @buffnac works for me :p
[5:59:52] Blastmindx: also*
[5:59:59] joyrex_j9: if you bot on DH you can just iframe any CC that has travel time
[6:00:09] joyrex_j9: I've had DH's just retreat every grapple weapon I've done on monk
[6:00:10] CatnipEvergreen: blade dance kinda makes sense tho it says increases dodge by 100% while attacking unless they changed that since legion
[6:00:34] Reminosity: don't do arenas in greens right now unless you want to hate your life
[6:00:34] Blastmindx: yeah i mean just one of them would be fine
[6:00:45] Blastmindx: but they have a bunch XD
[6:00:58] CatnipEvergreen: @reminosity I tried a few on ret and didn‚Äôt hate my life but was having major anxiety XD
[6:01:00] joyrex_j9: its just a situation like it was with ret where the combination of all of the elements makes it too oppressive
[6:01:07] joyrex_j9: too tanky for how much damage and support they have
[6:01:11] Blastmindx: yup exactly
[6:01:36] shad3dspectr3: when's the last time we had a class/spec this wild? I'm trying to think, was aug even this bad, it was more of a one shot no?
[6:01:40] joyrex_j9: on top of having an incredibly simple DPS rotation that anyone can do optimally
[6:01:46] joyrex_j9: it was ret
[6:01:48] Ambersulfr: last one this bad was ret
[6:01:48] joyrex_j9: ret is the best comparison
[6:01:50] Blastmindx: @shad3dspectr3 i would say S4 BFA destro lock
[6:02:00] shad3dspectr3: I think it was destro lock yea
[6:02:14] CatnipEvergreen: remember when chaos bolt hit through absorb shields? Wild shit
[6:02:15] joyrex_j9: they hyper simplified ret's rotation to the point where anyone could do optimal damage and then made a bunch of it ranged
[6:02:19] shad3dspectr3: maybe cosmic trinket sub rogue in slands, but even then it wasn't truck healer and instant win like dh
[6:02:26] tomzartheravenlord: @Blastmindx Agree, corruption worked so well with destro spec, insane dmg with one bolt
[6:02:37] CatnipEvergreen: anyone else miss Exorcism on ret? ;-;
[6:02:39] gelatokush: ret dps rotation never been complicated
[6:02:47] Blastmindx: @CatnipEvergreen They have it in SoD Kappa
[6:02:49] joyrex_j9: okay well it was clunky and gcd heavy
[6:02:59] shad3dspectr3: DAMN dh loses that insane
[6:02:59] frost4mournee: gege
[6:03:02] CatnipEvergreen: @blastmindx season of dull ResidentSleeper
[6:03:04] FateIRL: is this ele a robot
[6:03:08] Kikrino: giving the mage dps? whats that tho
[6:03:17] Ambersulfr: they streamlined it and then they gave them magic bop and some other things that made them practically immune to dying, similar to what dh is like now.
[6:03:21] Rufio2007: blessing of summer
[6:03:23] zachgamegodx: u can do whatever u want rofl
[6:03:36] frost4mournee: you have to take this round
[6:03:40] Slayer_Eagleone: meanwhile SOD players are holding hands singing kumbaya lol
[6:03:43] joyrex_j9: and you also couldn't really avoid their damage, also very similar to DH now
[6:03:47] frost4mournee: I‚Äôm believe in u
[6:03:50] joyrex_j9: with their self cleansing and mobility
[6:03:56] joyrex_j9: constant glaive throwing
[6:04:00] shad3dspectr3: HAHAHA
[6:04:15] frost4mournee: lol
[6:04:21] shad3dspectr3: peepoCheer go DH peepoCheer
[6:04:23] Blastmindx: @CatnipEvergreen based
[6:04:36] joyrex_j9: most DH's I've seen that fail in shuffle just do it to themselves through ego
[6:04:40] CatnipEvergreen: is word of glory still healing less than ret paladins word of glory? KEKW
[6:05:05] Ambersulfr: I had a dh lobby against bm, sub rogue, and ret this morning and it was the first lobby I've ever had where I didn't feel immortal
[6:05:18] gelatokush: only thing u can do about dh is cc them
[6:05:22] joyrex_j9: yep
[6:05:31] e10100111001: nice recovery
[6:05:34] joyrex_j9: CC the fuck out of them because they're a raid boss
[6:05:35] Reythewrecker: this song always makes me laugh WHO CAN RELATE
[6:05:38] Ambersulfr: stun into root into stun into root into stun into root
[6:05:43] joyrex_j9: roots used to be good against them
[6:05:52] joyrex_j9: not as much with the self dispel
[6:05:54] vanlonja: @CatnipEvergreen Ret WoG heals for 70k before dampening KEKW
[6:05:56] joyrex_j9: unless its steel trap
[6:05:58] Slayer_Eagleone: i hate when DH players say their damage is justified cause they are one of the few classes that can die in stuns..
[6:06:01] frost4mournee: why this dh doesnt use any cc
[6:06:02] Ambersulfr: yeah it was bm right
[6:06:13] joyrex_j9: having a physical root is actually so clutch
[6:06:16] joyrex_j9: and there's only one of them?
[6:06:24] cajovysacok: can you  see something when your party frames are so small ? LUL LUL LUL
[6:06:26] Ambersulfr: I can't think of another off the top of my head
[6:06:29] GiiGa07: Gg
[6:06:33] Bronloch: 5-1 NICE
[6:06:36] gelatokush: i mean most dh are very dumb and will trhow away both immo charges for dmg in the start and then will get rooted
[6:06:36] CatnipEvergreen: what‚Äôs your favourite healer to play right now?
[6:06:37] SuperSerbTV: how do you track fforberance on the side on friendly nameplates?
[6:06:44] seaent: +30 mmr lol
[6:06:51] joyrex_j9: oh the double disable root on WW
[6:06:58] Bronloch: close calls but making it look easy dude! <3
[6:06:59] sestren: the dh who started at higher mmr gets more mmr from winning 1 game less LUL

[6:14:08] Pierre493: is crusader on camera actually a persona or it's really how he is?
[6:14:13] FateIRL: he said he never writes mean things to ppl in game so the wow ban makes no sense
