[0:47:58] eathdemon: @Towelliee its normal you do it through the duty finder

[0:48:28] Korupcija_: do not play our game 😡
[0:48:39] G0THIHOP: i’m so freakin excited
[0:48:46] eathdemon: savage in 2 weeks
[0:48:50] G0THIHOP: the raid looked so cool during the live letter
[0:49:15] Shinji_Ex: have no clue wut to expect went dark mode
[0:49:22] westwood_beaverhausen: is the server live yet
[0:49:26] PadidinJones: Going in blind?
[0:49:27] nathrizen: what're you guys targetting in terms of tokens for this week and the next?
[0:49:28] G0THIHOP: kinda cool not having a PTR
[0:49:42] Shinji_Ex: I know where we are going but yea
[0:49:45] slipmat100: Patch seems a bit light at 431MB, maybe a second update later before opening up?
[0:49:48] Kuro_Sj: there is a world race for savage tho
[0:49:48] eathdemon: no ptrs, and shockingly almost no bugs
[0:50:02] westwood_beaverhausen: imagine having the public do QA
[0:50:04] edeasknight: plenty of speculation since it's a location from a previous final fantasy
[0:50:18] Shinji_Ex: savage got delayed cause of Q times an holidays
[0:50:22] nathrizen: they made the game simple to balance; and consequently, balancing is easier, shocking

[0:54:18] TeremusSama: Have you seen the live letter preview of the Pandaemonium Raid? It looks like its following suite from FF2/FF9 and its the literal seat/castle of hell
[0:54:59] TeremusSama: Curious if we gonna get trolled and have to fight Pandaemonium Warden from FF11. the raid boss that took 20hours to kill kek

[1:02:16] Hrist: they nerfed Labyrinthos Grape Crystal
[1:02:38] Shinji_Ex: ?
[1:02:39] JonFrakes: ^ what is that
[1:02:39] westwood_beaverhausen: low polygon grapes
[1:03:16] Hrist: they had grapes that were like 4 polgons and the community meme'd so hard they patched em
[1:03:47] Drnimbus1: Hello how’s endwalker been for you
[1:03:57] NeikanQt: It’s been amazing
[1:04:08] westwood_beaverhausen: remember, remember the grape crystals once lived
[1:04:18] JonFrakes: ah ok. yes  noticed those grapes were just boxes with grapes on each side
[1:04:29] JonFrakes: * pics of grapes
[1:04:31] mulletrocker11358: that shit is soo good
[1:04:34] TeremusSama: Experience points earned by completing level 81 to 89 dungeons has been increased.  No more bozja 81-90 maybe? hype?
[1:04:55] kamuriz: just spam Fates.. got 6 90s allready xD
[1:05:10] TeremusSama: same kanubi i finished my 6th before patch XD
[1:05:15] KhalaVenix: yep bozja and zadnor instances were full 24/7
[1:05:16] Oswanov: It's awesome that they boosted dungeon xp instead of nerfing Bozja
[1:05:26] Shinji_Ex: exp was already pretty decent for new dungeons but I guess
[1:05:28] westwood_beaverhausen: fates give big exp as well as currency for materials for money
[1:05:40] pavepawns: wait a minute... this isnt dota
[1:05:41] NeikanQt: Debating if staying up is worth it
[1:05:46] Korupcija_: you're getting beaten by a VTUBER DansGame
[1:05:51] JonFrakes: ppl just played bozja for relic weapon progrression
[1:05:54] filipinomadman: I agree.
[1:05:59] filipinomadman: it felt so underwhelming
[1:06:07] LoraFrost: You're not actually PLAYING anything right now
[1:06:09] Shinji_Ex: I was always 2 levels ahead idk
[1:06:15] Bogzeh: u needed 3-4 dungeons for one lvl seemed fine to
[1:06:26] nathrizen: bozja will still be my goto for grinding to lev 90.  being uber geared and having superpowers
[1:06:28] filipinomadman: like id rather do fates to level than grind dungeons.
[1:06:40] hoyhoy007: Pog
[1:06:42] LoraFrost: I did like wow, was super into it, but now I'd rather ffxiv
[1:06:53] pronebone69: wrong section man wtf? hammers down!
[1:06:59] Oswanov: It's decent with a battle manual (15% boost) + food. It's like 7 or so runs until you unlock the next dun dungeon at the odd levels
[1:07:02] PadidinJones: You finally got oondasta! any clip that shit?
[1:07:06] Shinji_Ex: dungeons are a lot shorter unlike shadowbringers
[1:07:06] JD_Rieku: How many attempts did bear take :D?
[1:07:13] NimseyHobbs: never played wow so not sure what any of that is techOk
[1:07:25] JD_Rieku: Gamer ...
[1:07:37] JD_Rieku: jealous
[1:07:47] Korupcija_: you're being humble, you're too good at this game!
[1:08:05] JonFrakes: I swore never to go back to WoW after legion
[1:08:17] kamuriz: oomkin <3 played that for 15 years BibleThump
[1:08:34] NimseyHobbs: well congrats on getting the item techYo
[1:08:55] Shinji_Ex: sage needs more healing potency, early dungeons you can tell there are problems
[1:09:17] kamuriz: nana! Sage is awsome if you know how to play! :D
[1:09:29] JonFrakes: the moment they nerfed all artifact weapons in bfa I quit
[1:09:43] JD_Rieku: I got the dragonling trinket along with the emerald nightmare trinky was a sick combo
[1:10:09] TeremusSama: Servers up at 5am EST for raid?
[1:10:20] NimseyHobbs: how many classes/jobs does wow have?
[1:10:22] Oswanov: servers up in about 2h
[1:10:30] pavepawns: i still think u woulda cleared bear around 10 attempts without the sethe trinket cause overall you handled the kruul phase fine
[1:10:33] TeremusSama: says 2am PST on notes
[1:10:40] westwood_beaverhausen: 1 hour 57 minutes

[1:12:21] wadufrick1: Um this is not final fantasy
[1:12:40] pavepawns: no i meant more cause i personally find questing boring. so i hoped you wouldnt go do some questing (which you luckily wont)
[1:12:45] chanze_leigh: release is only normal so yea it will be fast
[1:12:57] aburii_: the normal mode raid might only take you an hour
[1:12:57] JonFrakes: LUL
[1:13:01] aburii_: it's like lfr
[1:13:11] NeikanQt: There a few playing FFXIV rn
[1:13:12] TeremusSama: Ur looking at about 30-45mins/boss with a decent group
[1:13:12] chanze_leigh: last raid was 20 mins
[1:13:13] chillmatic617: normal raid releases are like LFR releases
[1:13:15] Oswanov: If you read stry its gonna be a couple hours
[1:13:18] Oswanov: probs
[1:13:27] Oswanov: actually, maybe not
[1:13:28] NeikanQt: But they Korean
[1:13:32] Oswanov: since only 1 tier
[1:13:40] antis0shall: so servers arent up until 4AM CST?
[1:13:45] TeremusSama: 580 ilvl
[1:13:49] chanze_leigh: sorry on chaos cant help u there
[1:13:59] TeremusSama: 580 ilvl armor, prob 590 weapon
[1:14:00] chanze_leigh: 580 probably
[1:14:00] JonFrakes: I've always played solo in ffxiv, never been in companies
[1:14:04] Oswanov: And it's tokens, not items
[1:14:05] chanze_leigh: yes
[1:14:05] NimseyHobbs: ilvl 580 - to enter you need 565
[1:14:06] aburii_: the raid drops tokens you turn in for gear
[1:14:14] Korupcija_: game is literally dead
[1:14:30] NeikanQt: I swear to you there is people streaming ffxiv rn lol
[1:14:30] westwood_beaverhausen: normal difficulty should be like normal trials right?
[1:14:30] TeremusSama: be careful when you roll for tokens Towelliee, you can only get 1 token/raid. so if u roll for a boot token, you cant win anymore.
[1:14:31] Rivanozz: hope the raid questline get voice-acted.
[1:14:34] Shinji_Ex: nothing to do, lol I got all the jobs to level up for months :)
[1:14:38] NeikanQt: Unless it’s like a vod
[1:14:43] TeremusSama: from that raid
[1:14:51] aries313: so you're 574
[1:14:54] Oswanov: @Biby07 Yeah
[1:15:01] chanze_leigh: yes but save those for mounts
[1:15:05] NimseyHobbs: yeah 5 times per accessory
[1:15:09] NimseyHobbs: times*
[1:15:10] Molvonos: @Shinji_Ex What you're willing to do and what other people are willing to do for fun is entirely different.
[1:15:11] aries313: oh yeah easy
[1:15:13] NimseyHobbs: tomes** bah
[1:15:23] aries313: yeah lockout is like that

[1:15:31] Shinji_Ex: @Molvonos :)
[1:15:35] TeremusSama: like say the boss drops 2 boot token, 2 glove and 2 accessory. And you win the boot one, you cant win anymore from that raid
[1:15:36] LoraFrost: why are you at throne?
[1:15:38] aburii_: yes
[1:15:41] LoraFrost: the mount here?
[1:15:45] TeremusSama: u can run it multiple times, but loot only once
[1:15:47] Oswanov: It's 4 tokens for chest and legs, 2 for glove boot and helmet and 1 for acc
[1:15:52] aries313: each wing you can only loot them once a week
[1:15:55] Tolemi959: Until you win an item, after that no more loot
[1:15:56] JeffsStolenBike: JeffsStolenBike subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 37 months! 
[1:15:58] aries313: do them as many times as you want
[1:16:09] Skillet_Head: I am excited to see which one will be the Gatekeeper Boss
[1:16:17] TeremusSama: 1 token/floor
[1:16:21] Oswanov: 4 tokens
[1:16:24] Oswanov: 1 per boss
[1:16:24] aries313: 1 per boss
[1:16:29] westwood_beaverhausen: you gootta aim for a specific token
[1:16:29] jumbobananasplit: one per boss
[1:16:30] aburii_: legs are 4 tokens
[1:16:32] TeremusSama: + 1 weapon token per week from completion
[1:16:37] chanze_leigh: 1
[1:16:37] Skillet_Head: there will be 4 bosses
[1:16:38] TeremusSama: 1
[1:16:39] aries313: 4 bosses
[1:16:42] TeremusSama: itll most likely be
[1:16:45] Skillet_Head: thats it
[1:16:47] Wildsmasher: Wildsmasher subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 54 months! 
[1:16:50] westwood_beaverhausen: choose which pice of gear you wanna get and roll for that token
[1:16:53] aries313: yeah
[1:16:53] Skillet_Head: right!
[1:16:53] chanze_leigh: yes
[1:16:55] Oswanov: yeah
[1:17:00] JonFrakes: yes
[1:17:03] Oswanov: Very formulaic
[1:17:04] TeremusSama: yes exactly
[1:17:04] night__monkey: i really hope we see some new mechanics this raid i am so tired of the same stack and spread markers
[1:17:09] TeremusSama: yes
[1:17:10] JonFrakes: they never deviated from that system
[1:17:11] Skillet_Head: yes however the tokens vary what you need
[1:17:13] aburii_: I think it takes 7 weeks for the weapon tokens
[1:17:18] TeremusSama: u should avoid ACC tokens if possible early
[1:17:18] NimseyHobbs: so lets say you roll for an item, but you lose to someone else, does that count as an attempt and i lose out for the week?
[1:17:24] TeremusSama: since u can get 580 acc from zodiark
[1:17:33] TeremusSama: u want armor tokens
[1:17:38] Rivanozz: @towelliee how do you feel about WoW have tokens for mount too like FF? Some of mount drop rate kinda ridiculous
[1:17:39] Oswanov: @NimseyHobbs No, its one win, not one roll
[1:17:49] NimseyHobbs: @NimseyHobbs ok great, thanks
[1:17:50] Oswanov: So until you actually get a token, you have a chance
[1:17:52] Korupcija_: ye, whenever they try something different people actually don't like it
[1:17:59] Korupcija_: like fatescribe
[1:18:02] Skillet_Head: this is normal procedure so far, 4 for chest and legs, 2 for boots, head, or hands, one for accessories for turn in
[1:18:05] Exusprime: imagine  it
[1:18:08] Skillet_Head: so plan accordingly
[1:18:10] gwynegaming: @night__monkey what would you reccomend
[1:18:15] TeremusSama: u wanna upgrade ur 570 armors. Weapons 580 hyd and acc are 580 zodiark
[1:18:24] Skillet_Head: its a weekly time out
[1:18:25] TeremusSama: and then min/max ur acc after u got armor
[1:18:29] TeremusSama: Chest/Legs prio
[1:18:31] aburii_: you go for the gear that has the best stats
[1:18:31] Skillet_Head: chest and legs has highest stats
[1:18:32] chanze_leigh: @skillet_head patch notes did confirm that for this pass
[1:18:34] TeremusSama: then helm
[1:18:37] TeremusSama: then boots/glove
[1:18:42] TeremusSama: biggest gains
[1:18:46] Tolemi959: Whichever looks the coolest Kappa
[1:18:52] chanze_leigh: yes that is what I will be doing
[1:18:52] Oswanov: Craft comes with savage in 2 weeks
[1:18:53] Creakydoors: That's Jan.
[1:18:54] TeremusSama: 565 crafting
[1:18:55] aburii_: crafted gear is better then normal raid gear
[1:19:00] TeremusSama: when savage drop
[1:19:00] Rivanozz: in 2 weeks
[1:19:00] Skillet_Head: Crafted gear is notmally BiS if pentamelded
[1:19:06] Skillet_Head: normally*
[1:19:13] NimseyHobbs: crafted will also be 580
[1:19:15] Skillet_Head: but that will be dropped later
[1:19:18] TeremusSama: but u can penta meld the crafted
[1:19:37] JonFrakes: crafting is just a huge money sink

[1:19:41] Nokterian: it is own mini game
[1:19:56] Rivanozz: pentameld crafted gear in first week can sell like millions LUL
[1:19:56] Korupcija_: what made new world crafting so good?
[1:20:00] chanze_leigh: mines like a 3k que usually
[1:20:03] JonFrakes: you have to level all of them at the same time / omnicraft
[1:20:05] chanze_leigh: at primetime
[1:20:07] Skillet_Head: best way to level crafting is collectables, however, you got to get to hw crafting
[1:20:12] Skillet_Head: nah
[1:20:22] Skillet_Head: crafting is optional for first week clears
[1:20:29] chanze_leigh: crafted gear can hold penta melds and can be better stated for a class
[1:20:31] jumbobananasplit: yeah, it's catch up gear
[1:20:32] KnightWay2020: oh wow maintenance over already?
[1:20:35] xotankkk: but crafting has HQ witch ios about 5ilvl higher and has pentameld
[1:20:44] TeremusSama: Crafted Gear is only really worth if your going for week 1 savage clears tbh
[1:20:54] TeremusSama: b/c ur gonna drop 100mil+ on penta melding
[1:21:19] chanze_leigh: it will be busy at launch of the raid
[1:21:22] Oswanov: Probably, but its also tuesday
[1:21:30] angelskyd: @Towelliee First off, God bless. Hope you are well. So, Years and Years ago you made a video for wow BG's and you said to some guy "lets go green eyes" I dont know why but that shit stuck and my nephew was saying that for years. Anyone that messed with him, he would say, lets go green eyes.
[1:21:31] Skillet_Head: if you wanna make gil, sell your materia during this time
[1:21:38] Rivanozz: Aether queue PepeLaugh
[1:21:48] Skillet_Head: people are gonna eat through materia like candy
[1:21:56] Skillet_Head: so the demand will be high
[1:22:11] TeremusSama: u should sell your IX materia when savage comes out since you need it for penta melding
[1:22:17] Skillet_Head: Pentamelding is brutal when crafted set comes out
[1:22:17] TeremusSama: hold till then
[1:22:24] soysos91: holdddddd
[1:22:41] NeikanQt: I has 300 crit X materia waiting for the server to come back up
[1:22:51] NeikanQt: Muwhahaha
[1:22:52] Oswanov: So how does penta melding work? Is it just normal melding with a low chance yo succeed or what
[1:22:55] Skillet_Head: you have a 17% chance for first over meld, 7% chance for fourth, 5% chance for fifth or it breaks
[1:23:13] chanze_leigh: it is
[1:23:14] Skillet_Head: they will go through potentially hundreds of materia
[1:23:17] jamaikietis777: im new in game, is it posible to make 100mil gil a day?
[1:23:20] xotankkk: penta meld means put 5 materias on every piece of gear
[1:23:22] TeremusSama: Penta Melding is just adding extra materia to gear outside the allowed normal amount
[1:23:25] JonFrakes: it is a massive gil sink
[1:23:32] Rakurai: if you farm the heck out of materia with hunts it's not that bad.
[1:23:33] Skillet_Head: you can make a shit ton of gil
[1:23:36] gwynegaming: pentameld is expensive
[1:23:39] Oswanov: Those are low odds, damn
[1:23:49] Korupcija_: any swipers?
[1:23:52] JonFrakes: expect crafting/gathering materia prices to be expensive
[1:23:55] Skillet_Head: that or lucky
[1:23:58] soysos91: yeah price of materia skyrockets
[1:24:05] TeremusSama: I have 3b gil =x been playing since arr kek
[1:24:09] gwynegaming: you need like what....50-90 materia to pentameld 1 piece
[1:24:12] Konage7: yeah I made like 40m selling materia
[1:24:12] Nokterian: gil is no issue in ffxiv
[1:24:14] Oswanov: I hope there's gonna be a bunch of Savage streams, really cirous about the race
[1:24:24] Skillet_Head: 1st boss is a giant grape!
[1:24:29] Skillet_Head: lmao
[1:24:31] chanze_leigh: I just save up materia and change it up outside black brush
[1:24:49] Korupcija_: how much is 3mil in wow?
[1:24:59] Nokterian: not mutch
[1:25:00] Rottencoarse: good morning @Towelliee  :) gl with the raid man
[1:25:07] Nokterian: LUL
[1:25:07] chanze_leigh: the cost all depends on which data center you are on as well
[1:25:08] EckvonSpeck: what job do you guy recommend for a beginner who wants to play a heal?
[1:25:09] Tyriandar: There is a culture of making food like "decent" in Japan. Also, the FF team acknowleding about the silly things we meme on is probably part of the reason why the game is in a healthy state
[1:25:48] TeremusSama: did you see when yoshi p told the cosplayer lady to step on him? kek
[1:25:54] Korupcija_: get 2 people from chat to summon
[1:25:56] jaina8675309: i at 17 60s now in wow
[1:25:57] Skillet_Head: lemme put it to you this way, I put 30 mil gil for my lvl 80 aesthetes crafting gear for pentamelding. And thats when that set was old so imagine how much worse it was
[1:26:00] Korupcija_: streamer privleges
[1:26:34] chanze_leigh: crafting and gathering materia does cost more on most data centers though
[1:26:35] redcapcombo: Morning! sorry I cant stay and watch just on my lunch break at work and wanted to stop by. hope you are enjoying it!
[1:26:39] Nokterian: Preach is stormblood en he discovers the step on me lady simping LUL
[1:26:45] Nokterian: in*
[1:26:45] TeremusSama: its about 100-150mil depending on RNG to do an entire penta meld set on release generally
[1:27:00] Rivanozz: Did you know that the critically acclaimed MMORPG Final Fantasy XIV does NOT have a free trial and does NOT include the entirety of A Realm Reborn NOR the award-winning Heavensward expansion up to level 60? NO! Restrictions on playtime! Do NOT sign up and enjoy Eorzea today!

[1:28:17] Skillet_Head: make so much money off of those first week raiders
[1:28:36] TeremusSama: best time to make gil is week 1 of savage releases 100%
[1:28:53] Watts__: @skillet_head What is the best way to spend colored gems to make money on the market board?
[1:29:08] Oswanov: What do gold certificates sell for normally at savage release
[1:29:10] chanze_leigh: the patch was pushed live if you haven't tried to log in and update do that first towel
[1:29:19] Rakurai: people usually have the first three fights cracked by week 1.
[1:29:20] Rottencoarse: @Towelliee  no sir panda is playing CoD:Mobile @Towelliee
[1:29:20] Konage7: they do
[1:29:22] chanze_leigh: no pf for nm
[1:29:22] Skillet_Head: colored gems? you mean the fate gems?
[1:29:25] Creakydoors: LUL they do.
[1:29:26] TeremusSama: you can PF Savage week 1 100% especially the first tier
[1:29:28] Konage7: I PF savage
[1:29:28] Reap14: first couple savage bosses aren't usually that bad
[1:29:29] Rivanozz: @watts__ sell berkanan sap. or check MB
[1:29:30] DrSquirtle01: you can generally do the first 3 in pf
[1:29:34] Creakydoors: No one cares about WFR LUL
[1:29:41] Konage7: Yeah launch
[1:29:44] WoW_StandalonE: ppl gonna party finder savage 100%
[1:29:45] chanze_leigh: yea I do as well
[1:29:46] Watts__: @Rivanozz Thank you
[1:29:49] Skillet_Head: or you are talking about materia?
[1:29:51] chanze_leigh: no they dont
[1:29:56] Oswanov: @TeremusSama Semi blind or after guides/streams?
[1:29:57] saltseal: people like to blind run stuff
[1:30:08] TeremusSama: semi blind for first tier fairly easy
[1:30:11] johnnysins_xiv: oi there, hows it going
[1:30:12] Konage7: I like pfing on launch for blind runs.
[1:30:14] Skillet_Head: yeah sap will make money, its a ingredient for pots
[1:30:14] TeremusSama: savage raids arnt usually bad until last bosses
[1:30:17] Reap14: people participate in the world face race they just don't make a huge deal about it
[1:30:20] Shinji_Ex: world 1st pretty popular in FFXIV not sure where you guys got ur info
[1:30:20] chanze_leigh: but yea nm is just go in and usually kill
[1:30:25] TeremusSama: Kefka was killed week 1 by PF
[1:30:25] Creakydoors: Most people blind run.
[1:30:28] Skillet_Head: Raiders will eat it like candy
[1:30:30] Watts__: LUL I can imagine
[1:30:48] WoW_StandalonE: @Creakydoors not true lol
[1:30:52] TeremusSama: ideally ur gonna do 1 savage/day
[1:30:56] DrSquirtle01: i killed shiva savage in pf day 2
[1:30:58] Oswanov: I was never here for savage release, only started in september, and am pretty curious about savage, just for fun. Progging the extremes for the first time was pretty fun
[1:31:12] Reap14: It isn't common for pf to clear the savage raid week one..some will sure but most will not
[1:31:13] TeremusSama: so like tuesday savage release, ull do 1st fight. wednesday 2nd, thursday 3rd, friday-satruday last boss
[1:31:24] johnnysins_xiv: tier 1 should be as easy as it can get. Also people that dc inside the savage instance should get a prio to get back in, i'm quite sure they did the same in shb
[1:31:53] Oswanov: @Timidity Prio is nice, didnt know about that.
[1:32:03] Ajintroz: i got to finshed leveling reaper before i can do the trial
[1:32:10] NimseyHobbs: can't spoil that story
[1:32:16] Reap14: Well yea who wants to spoil a 10 year old story
[1:32:21] Oswanov: Everyone playing it man, noone watching. I think that's pretty healthy
[1:32:22] night__monkey: practically no viewers on twitch yet up to 10k queue on every server
[1:32:35] TeremusSama: the worst savage ever on release was A3S and A4S imo
[1:32:37] Watts__: Yeah story spoils. I avoided all ff14 twitch until I was done
[1:32:39] TeremusSama: that shit was brutal hard
[1:32:50] Konage7: story actually good in ff14 so people are busy
[1:32:52] chillmatic617: its because savage tiers are cleared by organized groups a few hours after release at like 10am eastern, there's not much to watch
[1:32:58] Nokterian: I'm still doing endwalker at my own speed
[1:33:05] johnnysins_xiv: Everything up to Midas was a fuckup by them, prolly the worst raiding experience i had ever
[1:33:10] Rivanozz: LUL
[1:33:16] TeremusSama: i wish guilds wouldnt post videos at least until week 1 was over
[1:33:20] TeremusSama: but muh views
[1:33:26] DrSquirtle01: they do "job guides" as well which like barely scratch the surface of any content
[1:33:27] Reap14: Yea they want to make you mad enough to click
[1:33:37] Rivanozz: viewer count andy LUL
[1:33:39] jeflag: theres an article about how aether currents is the worst thing ever
[1:33:41] Shinji_Ex: Q times lol say otherwise the highest number of players ever playing
[1:33:49] Oswanov: Asmon on his alt stream had so many people tell him that the release flopped because of the viewership and everytime he asnwers them he is more sarcastic, its hilarious
[1:33:52] mikejames01: cant base oa game off of twitch viewers wtf
[1:33:53] Nokterian: not everyone watches or uses twitch
[1:33:54] TeremusSama: @Timidity living liquid on release never forget
[1:34:08] TeremusSama: the static slayer
[1:34:12] Miss_Kas: KEKW
[1:34:20] Nokterian: LUL
[1:34:21] Rakurai: KEKW
[1:34:32] johnnysins_xiv: @TeremusSama True and job design didnt help either lmao
[1:34:38] Trekytv: thats the same people that say wow is dead because the main city is empty
[1:34:42] johnnysins_xiv: tanking that shit was a pain in the dick
[1:34:48] Nightshaft25: KEKW
[1:34:55] Nokterian: WoW has the worst to get flying lol
[1:35:00] Molvonos: Aether currents are fantastic.  Whoever wrote that article's a mouthbreathing windowlicker.
[1:35:03] idenkaz_: we already sperging out chat? get a snickers.
[1:35:05] Oswanov: Maintenance end earlier https://eu.finalfantasyxiv.com/lodestone/news/detail/1072d48082f8386404110aaab6d5448bb3f5137f
[1:35:05] cruzeal: don't spawn yet nalak monkaW
[1:35:31] veryhairyheyyall: monkaS
[1:35:42] TeremusSama: i dont think tanking living liquid was too bad tbh, it was more the dps check on the fight was brutal, on top of the double hand phase needing to stay 5% apart the entire time or instawipe
[1:35:52] SuperBrotendo: FF is treated as react content by Twitch viewers and the FF community. I've seen them go on hate campaigns against streamers that didn't react the "right way" over a character reveal
[1:35:54] TeremusSama: if u didnt have a NIN and DRG u basically couldnt clear
[1:36:01] Lupine_Fury: hola roberto
[1:36:04] zakare232: the asmon viewers are Pretty COPIUM
[1:36:11] GameInsideXXL: after playing ff14 i can never play an mmo again where you need to have make a ton of different alts
[1:36:24] mikejames01: dumb
[1:36:24] SeckSymbols: Oh shit servers up in 1 minute?
[1:36:30] TeremusSama: WoW would be 100x better if you could play multiple classes on 1 charactert
[1:36:36] Watts__: @Oswanov Woah for real?
[1:36:41] Shinji_Ex: PogChamp
[1:36:53] Rivanozz: @gameinsidexxl True can play every class in one character sold the game for me
[1:36:53] Oswanov: @Towelliee https://eu.finalfantasyxiv.com/lodestone/news/detail/1072d48082f8386404110aaab6d5448bb3f5137f Maintenance ends early
[1:37:01] hoyhoy007: True
[1:37:08] TeremusSama: you can do new game + on your character towelliee, you dont have to make a new character
[1:37:15] pavepawns: arr was about pirates
[1:37:19] Menion01: Watch a lore video and save yourself 2 months.
[1:37:28] Molvonos: @pavepawns brizziBruh
[1:37:45] SuperBrotendo: Seriously this one streamer didn't remember who the fuck Graha Tia was. He was such a minor non-incident from ARR.
[1:37:46] Hobgawb: Which classes are you playing now in Endwalker?
[1:38:03] idenkaz_: it's painful to go back KEKW
[1:38:04] dalaraz: i just know alexander something but nver played ff
[1:38:05] TeremusSama: Sir its  Alisaie and male Alisaie.
[1:38:13] Watts__: 😳 Stormblood
[1:38:19] SeckSymbols: Well Graha wasnt required until literally a year ago
[1:38:21] Reap14: He wasn't a minor non incident though if you actually followed the story
[1:38:30] Oswanov: Servers up
[1:38:31] Watts__: servers LIVE>??
[1:38:31] ronasurvivor: servers are up

[1:38:36] BliTzStrike441: Servers are up
