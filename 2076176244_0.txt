[5:39:35] prodigy_wow: Holy feels good for healing but it feels bad when youre spamming dispel and go oom in 2 seconds
[5:39:55] aspectoflion: I‚Äôm a disc priest too, trying to get more gear for higher hp tho
[5:40:14] willcantstream: Priest is just bis class across the board its insane
[5:40:31] Omgezzz: is that a weakaura u have to the right of the raid frames, that show cd on spells? looks nice :D
[5:41:02] gratzitko: dispelling to much ooms u, its expensive

[5:42:43] erosih: yeah dispel is one of the many things that make priest an amazing pick to have
[5:42:45] aspectoflion: depends on gear too
[5:42:48] gratzitko: right

[5:48:27] gratzitko: i like that, options without sacrifice
[5:48:30] gratzitko: thats how it should be
[5:48:39] gratzitko: priest is like built perfect they just need every other class on board
[5:48:48] Felcsutinagyvasut: for 1v1 pvp void plague is like always better thogh, right?
[5:49:01] gratzitko: it seems like priest and druidx r getting ALL the effort tho
[5:49:37] gratzitko: hence why i made a priest, i know theyre never gonna make them bad in sod lol
[5:49:45] zeuthenx: Been so disappointed with phase 2 PvP, now I went back to Wrath üòÖ
[5:49:55] gratzitko: what class were u playin zeu

[6:04:55] Landon_MDL: hydra dont you think gnom belt is a litle better than AB?
[6:05:22] erosih: @unholy_john epic raid ring and the ring from warsong rep is decent enough before you get it
[6:05:31] erosih: I assume you have stv ring
[6:05:39] Landon_MDL: WHAT ABOUT ENGI BELT
