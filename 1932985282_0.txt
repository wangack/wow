[1:40:54] cryft: my buddy had a carbide ring and it broke within a year
[1:40:58] MyOpiate: mine is carbon fiber
[1:40:59] TheItalianStallion321: i know guys, in construction, wear a like rubber band around their rings.
[1:41:03] Asyrr1: I just did a tungsten band for mine simple looks solid
[1:41:03] tr4ncetv: silicone
[1:41:05] Allagash37: i wear a silicon wedding band that glows in the dark
[1:41:08] TheItalianStallion321: i have 1 friend who tattooed this ring on his finger
[1:41:09] aimassistallen: those new rubber bands are nice
[1:41:13] CeruleanStar: my band is actually a kind of rubber since i work on servers
[1:41:18] Seathasky: i just have a gold band myself

[1:41:34] cryft: @Asyrr1 make sure to protect it cause those are more brittle. they're cool af though
[1:41:43] 91Niki: @TheItalianStallion321 Yeah that's not uncommon either . People with tattoos on their fingers for wedding band
[1:41:51] Necrothia: You could easily get to Dm today, sadly have to restart from scratch ^-^

[1:42:16] infektyd: almost all the people i know have tattoos for a wedding band (also have a band) because theyre blue collar and dont want to mess up their ring
[1:42:20] UtherBrexton: I dont usually sentence people to death, but when I do its with hitmen
[1:42:38] Seathasky: getting a tattoo is odd
[1:42:41] 91Niki: @TheItalianStallion321 Yep LUL David Duchovny (Fox Mulder Xfiles) has one. Now he is divorced. I think he still has the tattoo

[1:43:36] infektyd: @Seathasky it makes sense if you work a lot with your hands, mechanic, farmer, fisherman, can get your finger stuck in equipment, bend, break or loose the ring, and you can put it on after work
[1:43:38] MyOpiate: my sister got a ring tatoo and regrets it

[2:12:20] TheMajinLuke: I genuinely can't remember now LUL
[2:12:21] SpidercowSD: Either way we slice it it was an awesome episode and set the stage for how well they can do TV shows again if they tried in other fantasy series
[2:12:26] mavericks312: Really? I think Ashoka is the best Star Wars show so far
[2:12:29] 91Niki: I might watch rebels after Ahsoka is done
[2:12:32] Mecabeast: yeah i can understand how you would feel lost watching it if you didnt watch clone wars and rebels
[2:12:37] Brandishblade: rebels gets good but starts out awful

[2:14:25] mavericks312: @91niki clone wars 100%
[2:14:30] 91Niki: @mavericks312 Thanks!
[2:15:05] 91Niki: @mavericks312 Are they both on Disney Plus?
[2:15:06] valianya: They activated the Superbloom, Frenzy, and Bounty Events in PTR, was kinda buggy.  End of Superbloom should've had a fight, but instead the NPC treant flew up into the sky like a rocket and vanished.  Frenzy kept phasing and vanishing.  Bounty didn't provide the extra reward bag for donating to grow the plant.
[2:15:06] vulkankragon: classic = auto attack the entire game. no idea why ppl are still playing it in 2023.
[2:15:16] Mecabeast: @91Niki personally im in favor of watching things chronologically so clone wars then rebels. if you just want ahsoka stuff i think d+ has a section where they pulled out the essential episodes

[4:10:56] Kinghorn: it is so nice
[4:10:56] Eregbueye: why do they double down on it
[4:11:06] Kinghorn: some trash in the alliance raids
[4:11:10] Kinghorn: and such
[4:11:49] Kinghorn: they sound like shredders
[4:11:55] Thesummerofkevin: trash also buys people time in between bosses to sort things out
[4:12:09] archninja64: More people would raid if raids were split up into wings like lfr and less or no trash I think, but I get why people like raids as one instance
[4:12:10] Kinghorn: trash also teaches boss mechanics, sometimes
[4:12:17] Korupcija_: we saw people death skip trash.. trash now must be killed to spawn the boss KEKW
[4:12:48] Dalrend7640: KEKW
[4:12:55] strike879: trash isnt the problem its that the players need to kill it if they gave an option to free a mob to kill the trash or trigger a bomb or something so its optional
