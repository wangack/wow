[3:17:29] eddi25: 8/8 t2 >>> PoH as priest
[3:17:30] Leipana: prayer of healing is bad
[3:17:30] My_Trolling_Account: Hey Guys I havent watched his WoW content, Can anyone tell me if this is Classic or something else? Thanks!
[3:17:31] Dave_e: prayer of healing is kinda shit, it only hits your own grp
[3:17:35] HoneyNutScooter: its good
[3:17:35] SmokingSlug: they are gonna go oom super fast tho using POH
[3:17:35] Dave_e: but it works

[3:17:50] deftimez: just spam distilled wisdom
[3:17:51] lemoncayenne: thats why theres a priest in every group almost
[3:17:51] beck13: PoH is how you go oom
[3:17:52] xLynguistics: Shroud, as a Priest. Alot of the high end Priest use 8/8 T2 and spam GH
[3:17:52] thegoatmaster23: NO poh is too mana intensive
[3:17:52] The__Shirt: @shroud 8/8 t2 does way more healing in general if people arent being topped
[3:17:53] HeyRahdee: @My_Trolling_Account this is shadowlands
[3:17:53] draikman: Make sure whoever is targeted by the bolt to be topped off heath
[3:17:54] Bishox: @shroud rank 1 can be good if everyone is taking damage
[3:17:54] saske_vernis_v_saratov: @shroud open window with hps pls on your addon (damage meter)

[3:18:19] Dave_e: if you could unit/group target it it would be godly
[3:18:20] skinnyb_: @Dave_e that's why there's supposed to be a priest in every group. PoH is bis on this fight no question about it.
[3:18:27] Dave_e: @skinnyb_ yeah for sure no doubt
[3:18:30] illoyz: other ranks are good as well if your whole group is low, but mostly shamans do the grp heal for horde thats why

[3:18:43] skinnyb_: nope
[3:18:49] eddi25: literally did this fight last night as priest
[3:18:51] The__Shirt: @skinnyb_ no it's not. t2 greater heal is more efficient and does stupid amounts of healing
[3:18:55] eddi25: 8/8 t2 is way stronger
[3:18:55] SlayerD3ath: did they do 4 horsemen?

[4:36:22] MannySJ: Challenging on your wallet
[4:36:22] 3nd0v3r: where u go Pluto
[4:36:23] Poleritude: Nax was out when I played but I never ran it, since it was brand new. That was just before I stopped playing.
[4:36:26] herefortheneuroplasticity: naxx killed my guild 15 years ago lol
[4:36:27] shakey_orange: Anybody know what addon it is that is changing the font??\
[4:36:31] sportzwithaz: I think we only fully finished it once
[4:36:32] MatthiasGlass: naxx was absolutely brutal when it first came out
[4:36:32] theDill: it was more rewarding when you didnt blast through it all first week, slowly progressing through the wings
[4:36:35] NicoNine: it was so much work back then, i quit Wow after clearing naxx, never bought BC
[4:36:35] Hirshberg: didn't like 1% of guilds clear Naxx in vanilla?
[4:36:35] Chenzillah: i love it
[4:36:35] Hazno: @oni475 only blizzard knows, but doubtful, they will most likely want players to move on to The Burning Crusade "Classic" when/if they release that
[4:36:46] vinnie_vs: @shroud challenge to your wallet
[4:36:48] roofpizza: roofpizza subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 27 months!

[4:37:14] Turbopumper: LULW
[4:37:15] MIZEROK: Dropping a bunch of stamina for some FrR isn't the way.

[4:37:28] updobe: @shroud you should get stam consumes. they are cheap and it's free health
[4:37:29] xezn1: I cant even imagine doing this raid in 2006 with 10 fps and 200 ms
[4:37:30] Bishox: @shroud you go below where you saw those guys and pick up crystals around the giants
[4:37:30] Hirshberg: @sph_god oof
[4:37:32] ProGuitarX: what are they doing?
[4:37:32] Klayjamin: @hirshberg 23 guilds killed KT before BC came out
[4:37:34] SamDeenMedina: Are you doing more saph attempts tonight.
[4:37:36] kade_one: @hirshberg or even 0.07 not sure
[4:37:41] onijoro: @Hazno i mean, classic is now a long time in the market didnt the player already unlocked most of items and achievements alrdy or do u have to grind this game a long time?
[4:37:42] Poleritude: Man, Mike needs a protection team to travel ahead of him like WoW Secret service :)
[4:37:45] aazzox: is it worth starting wow classic now?
[4:37:51] NicoNine: yea 2006 problem bosses where thaddius because of lag

[4:38:19] aazzox: k
[4:38:21] slayer_bun: yeah now head South to icy gorge area where giants are. lots of crystals to collect there
[4:38:23] Hazno: @oni475 they didn't release all of Classic's content at the same time, they released the content/raids in phases, and this is currently the last phase/raid that was released this week
[4:38:27] NicoNine: all in :)
[4:38:29] rawlenightlong: DID YOU GET THE BREAKFAST SAUSAGE THOUGH

[4:38:48] Dying_Sun_: Sapph is going to drag his balls across your faces without even buying you a drink
[4:38:52] cptn_my_cptn: idk how you can play this competitively at only 244hz. I only play on CRT
[4:38:52] Tulvik: Mercules PogChamp
[4:38:54] slackyr_: i was there 15 years ago learning every encounter 1 by 1 AMA
[4:39:00] Meshugunah: isn't this the sort of thing they should have sorted before naxx came out?
[4:39:03] polzielol_eu: Sapph is not a hard encounter
[4:39:05] kevinrulezdood: how much are magebloods going for on faerlina?
[4:39:07] Mcfree: @shroud did you play wow back in the day?
[4:39:10] kawinkttv: is classic done after this expansion?
[4:39:11] NicoNine: they done harder bosses i
[4:39:15] NicoNine: would say
[4:39:17] onijoro: @Hazno aaaah so there will be more raids coming most likely or is this the last one they didnt realease until burning crusade?
[4:39:29] polzielol_eu: its nothing compared to feenix hc mod
[4:39:31] Hazno: @oni475 this is the last one they released before burning crusade
[4:39:34] Poleritude: @erangleorbust I don't know how people faceplant on keyboards, and messages come out
[4:39:35] iamjo3l: @Mcfree he did. he loved it
[4:39:42] Yohnnie: so has the new xpac turned into the inevitable daily grind yet?
[4:39:42] onijoro: @Hazno ah ok ty bud
[4:39:43] kade_one: sapp is literal hardest boss just cus he needs lots of prep
[4:39:46] tempurasenpai: This is the last raid before burning crusade
[4:39:51] MIZEROK: In a raid.
[4:39:55] stemouttas: leave raid to complete q
[4:39:57] MannySJ: Yeah underneath
[4:39:57] MainmiseWL: FR and overheal it, decurse and its easy, we one shot saph and kt
[4:39:58] realhart: would you ever try destiny 2 raids?

[4:40:08] Meshugunah: @shroud need to drop group, can't complete non-raid quests in a raid group
[4:40:16] Hazno: @oni475 so unless Blizzard decides to add some brand new content to Classic that was never there in vanilla, this is the final content to be added to Classic
[4:40:17] tylermakin210: 4K or Bust.
[4:40:17] Shpro0: the hardest part of naxx is having 40 people on the same page with bosses that have actual mechanics
[4:40:20] Koffiekoekje: Oooh he hasn't the first quest
[4:40:20] slackyr_: @Supified 30 wipes only to manage the pull and figure out marks and general strat
[4:40:27] grumplepants: Shroud is not guild leader? Mind blown
[4:40:31] Klayjamin: @hype960 59 total
[4:40:31] MannySJ: Theres a lot underneath
[4:40:35] fnaut: 5K players searching mathmaking in SA - BR, all servers with cheaters
[4:40:35] polzielol_eu: sapph has insane prep, but the fight itself is not hard, aslong as you got proper mana pool on the healers, and that ppl self heal, self suffiency is so important, and as a caster you might have to pop GMP instead of GFPP
[4:40:47] defc0n83: Are they raiding again tonight
[4:40:49] fm72: you're in raid
[4:40:54] Hype960: @Klayjamin oh i feel even more speical then

[4:41:12] ItzFrostbiteTv: pog
[4:41:12] faultycontent: this encounter is not easy for 40 people to get right ....those top guilds spent over 100k gold to kill it on first pull
[4:41:13] Hirshberg: lots down in the ravine
[4:41:13] tactical_rage_quit: down botm
[4:41:14] onijoro: @Hazno why nobody got legendary items and how long does it take till raid start? its 5am in germany tho xD
[4:41:15] polzielol_eu: but thats kinda the thing with classic, its uhm, very different from later patches, especially since it "requires" 40 ppl to be synced
[4:41:15] N3ATAL: !mouse

[5:00:56] brantor07: I mean it makes sense, people paying money to play a game could essentially be bullied into quitting. hurts blizzard's bottom line

[5:01:01] marinnnnnna: Hi

[5:11:07] StreamElements: @MYLILFATCAT23, The reason why shroud streams at 936p is because twitch's bitrate cannot handle 1080p quality. 936p is better overall looking and quality wise than 1080p at the same bitrate.

[7:11:25] jfriendly: you really should go get full wbuffs if possible man

[9:01:09] pootereater: Good luck papa Shroud
[9:01:10] ub3rg00b3r: 40 players.. thats cute.. Try 72
[9:01:10] Magus002: i think they coudln't balance 40 people well
[9:01:11] bigdave315: it more of not being able to find 40 people
[9:01:12] Deshawawan: i like 10 man raids
[9:01:14] Mentalstatemike: !936p @Beershifter
[9:01:14] StreamElements: @Beershifter, The reason why shroud streams at 936p is because twitch's bitrate cannot handle 1080p quality. 936p is better overall looking and quality wise than 1080p at the same bitrate.
[9:01:15] fofilolipop: 15 less people who can fuck up

[9:01:19] weaselp1: nice beard it looks like you went down on it and came out with that
[9:01:20] C0smozero: yeah coordinating 40 is much harder than 25
[9:01:20] orderxv: what makes it easier is having competent people read a 10 minute guide from 15 years ago
[9:01:22] carpsz_: need more warriors
[9:01:22] weaselp1: this group could be better with a bork in your group
[9:01:23] Jcmana: WotLK and TBC PvE was some good stuff!

[9:01:25] cribban: @BADGER_1999_ Im having chest pains!!
[9:01:25] femadora: @deadbees1 no idea, but i'll make a wild guess, MikScrollingBattleText
[9:01:26] meepo699: @AllDayADK no
[9:01:26] mikeyzee: 40 people is hard af people dont get it
[9:01:27] bswaine: 40 man is only hard because its hard to get 40 good players on at the same time
[9:01:27] Anhak: @aimhaus also rev is legit one of the top boys so that also helps him contest for gear but yea in general you get 1-2 healing druids and sometimes 1 tank but tank doesnt have the same gear so that doesnt even matter.
[9:01:29] notRazx: PVE TBC was great
[9:01:30] Sandown: no world buffs in tbc
[9:01:31] mikeyzee: 40 people and if 1 fuck up ur done
[9:01:31] carpsz_: beacsue they can tank more of that damage
[9:01:32] ub3rg00b3r: EverQuest was 72

[9:01:44] surprisebees: I have no idea how EQ raids worked with 80+ people
