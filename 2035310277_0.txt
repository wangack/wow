[0:27:11] Lemon_King: D:
[0:27:19] LocketteSprite: Ooof
[0:27:21] mentosz09: @paintednpierced Don't pretend i don't have an imagination
[0:27:25] LocketteSprite: That does not look done indeed
[0:27:29] Masqerader: i wouldn't submit this tape to masterchef canada
[0:27:30] paintednpierced: @mentosz09 LMFAO
[0:27:34] Feisti718: did the yeast not activate?
[0:27:41] GrimGoreRMW: luxthoDead luxthoB
[0:27:42] Ceekayn_: luxthoRip
[0:27:45] Daemoos6: maybe removed too much yeast
[0:27:49] Voidthos: Luxthos you're supposed to cook the bread.
[0:27:49] SelroDreyar: millionaire streamer needs to hire a chef
[0:27:50] mentosz09: There's just one thing to do to that bread now luxthoGasm
[0:27:54] Aggy: oh boy that shit looks dense
[0:27:55] StreamElements:  Did you miss one of the playthroughs or would like to watch it again? The new channel Luxthos Plays is now live -> https://www.youtube.com/@luxthosplays
[0:27:58] LocketteSprite: It was still good attempt. I would not be able to get this far even
[0:28:02] xluckydawgx: @mentosz09 Do not FUCK the bread
[0:28:05] jmalmin: Taste the bread.
[0:28:06] LocketteSprite: With cooking bread it takes practice in general
[0:28:13] ectoman1ac: is the bread dense?
[0:28:15] ClutchKladdkaka: ^^
[0:28:17] cathmeill: tu as trop petri la pate dapres moi
[0:28:23] Aggy: Did you cut it while warm?
[0:28:23] mentosz09: @xluckydawgx Due to friction it would cook though
[0:28:26] Topele91: sogy
[0:28:30] NAT0_141: morning Lux and chat. how goes the day so far?
[0:28:35] ectoman1ac: did you wait for the bread to cool before you cut it?
[0:28:37] Nibbel__: Quick run to the store and buy a new loaf of bread, claim it as your own luxthoKEK luxthoKEK
[0:28:39] FormaxX22: !slot
[0:28:39] StreamElements: @FormaxX22 you got luxthoCake | luxthoCake | luxthoGasm and lost your 5 LuxBux
[0:28:41] Aggy: you need it too cool at least an hour before cutting
[0:28:41] phurq1: Morning Lux!
[0:28:43] mentosz09: Gotta hate soggy buns
[0:28:44] Feisti718: maybe the oven temp is not hot enough and you just need more time next time
[0:28:44] ectoman1ac: you NEVER cut fresh bread out of the oven
[0:28:49] Aggy: yeah
[0:28:53] Aggy: otherwise it squishes
[0:28:55] ectoman1ac: fresh bread cut = GG lose
[0:29:06] Aggy: That's bs
[0:29:20] buttercup8404: times can vary depending on different variables
[0:29:23] Stormrazer78: this is why men don’t cook ;)
[0:29:23] NAT0_141: 10-15 minutes is what we do with our fresh sourdough
[0:29:25] Feisti718: baking is an art and every oven is different
[0:29:31] LocketteSprite: Rolls will take only about 20 minutes to cool. Bread baked in a loaf pan can take as long as 1 hour and a large free-form loaf can take as long as 1 1/2 hours to cool.
[0:29:37] xluckydawgx: Elevation can play a part
[0:29:39] LocketteSprite: What google tells me ^
[0:29:41] ectoman1ac: i've done a ton of bread baking and waiting for it to fully cool is way better, there are flavour compounds that you lose as well
[0:29:41] Masqerader: the oven cooks, we watch
[0:29:42] snookacell: bread needs to be completely cooled off
[0:29:47] xluckydawgx: like me cooking bread here in FL can be different then you in Quebec
[0:29:48] buttercup8404: can always use temp gauge next time
[0:29:49] Aggy: Honestly Lux, if its any comfort my first bread sucked too
[0:30:08] Daemoos6: does it look edible?
[0:30:10] Feisti718: it takes practice
[0:30:11] SelroDreyar: I never really understood the gender thing with cooking
[0:30:14] ectoman1ac: yes you NEVER ever cut fresh hot bread, lose flavour + lose texture + high chance to deflate
[0:30:14] Stormrazer78: it wás nice try lux
[0:30:21] phurq1: Please show
[0:30:26] Daemoos6: Feed the birds with it
[0:30:26] Aggy: And yeah depending on airhumidity, level of humidity in the dough, the cooking time/rise time might differ
[0:30:31] Aggy: eventually you pick up on the cues
[0:30:36] Mr_Pennywise_: BOOP!
[0:30:43] cichlid722: toast?
[0:30:45] NAT0_141: might have had an issue with the proof
[0:30:49] remli1991: but isnt the airy look from the yeast activating? shouldnt you wait longer be4 putting it into the oven?
[0:30:53] Effin_Steffin: user error
[0:30:56] Daemoos6: Was the oven on? Kappa
[0:31:00] ectoman1ac: right now dense = likely underproofed, perhaps your cuts were not at a 30 degree angle/deep enough
[0:31:12] mentosz09: Should've beat the dough longer luxthoJam
[0:31:22] ectoman1ac: yeah then it sounds like it was underproofed
[0:31:33] Narosa25: luxthoHi Good morning Lux and chat! How's everyone doing?
[0:31:36] Aggy: It didnt proof for long enough
[0:31:50] mentosz09: Sounds like it needed more whiskey
[0:31:51] Feisti718: it didn’t rise long enough
[0:31:54] Feisti718: yes
[0:32:01] Aggy: Depends on temp, humidity
[0:32:03] cichlid722: yeast needed more time
[0:32:07] ectoman1ac: because there was less yeast, it rose less/lower, you can counter that by letting it rise longer
[0:32:14] NAT0_141: my wife has our sourdough proves for 16 hours minimum
[0:32:14] Aggy: You want me to send you a few cues?
[0:32:22] Stormrazer78: it snowed in Belgium this sux
[0:32:23] Aggy: I'm a bred expert luxthoChef
[0:32:26] ectoman1ac: and like everyone else is saying, your room temp + humidity plays a HUGE factor in the bread proofing
[0:32:28] Feisti718: depending on temperature and environment it can be pickey
[0:32:45] xluckydawgx: But yeah @Luxthos they showed off Frostpunk 2 and Prison Architect 2 yesterday, wasn't here so wasn't sure if you saw them
[0:32:47] TheCyberianMonk: When it comes to baking, I weigh everything instead of measuring it in cups and what not.
[0:32:48] mentosz09: Seems like a skill issue
[0:32:54] Daemoos6: Dasher on the way with breakfast poutine luxthoJam
[0:32:57] ectoman1ac: i would still eat that bread though LUL
[0:33:04] cichlid722: your oven might have a proof mode
[0:33:07] Feisti718: but if it looks undercooked it might be an oven calibration and you just need to learn the oven
[0:33:07] NAT0_141: yep that’s why bakers in the tent on Great British Bake Show have issues. humidity changes a lot
[0:33:22] buttercup8404: put it back in the oven?
[0:33:27] ectoman1ac: i would make soup and use that to dip, or you can make grilled cheese with dense bread
[0:33:28] Voidthos: Looks fine to me
[0:33:33] ectoman1ac: yeah it looks fine
[0:33:33] ermymunster: I think it's okay
[0:33:35] Lemon_King: macawGasm
[0:33:36] ridewitheden: looks perfect to me
[0:33:37] snookacell: thats done, you just cut it too soon
[0:33:38] NAT0_141: stodgy
[0:33:39] ectoman1ac: just dense but fine
[0:33:39] nivlars15: hi guys
[0:33:40] ermymunster: Some breads are a little moist still
[0:33:40] Tzarrus: that's looks cooked
[0:33:44] mentosz09: Moist eh? luxthoGasm luxthoGasm luxthoGasm
[0:33:48] ectoman1ac: see LUL
[0:33:50] TheCyberianMonk: @Daemoos6 We are still in the middle of an ice lockdown, Dashers haven't worked since Monday Night.
[0:33:50] ridewitheden: that is what I'd buy here in europe
[0:33:56] paintednpierced: MEH TOAST
[0:33:59] ridewitheden: that's what i's supposed to be like
[0:33:59] ectoman1ac: grilled cheese bread for dense bread Lux <3
[0:34:08] Indariil777: Bon appetite.
[0:34:09] remli1991: yep looks like normal bread to me tbh
[0:34:15] Daemoos6: cakey bread is still good
[0:34:18] jmalmin: Yeah toast the bread. or make grilled cheese
[0:34:25] StreamElements:  Enjoying the stream? Considering subscribing to support: https://www.twitch.tv/subs/luxthos
[0:34:34] Daemoos6: Could try making french toast with it
[0:34:36] jmalmin: Almost looks the same.
[0:34:44] Feisti718: not as airy
[0:34:47] Biggins_Prime: sounds like over=kneading
[0:34:50] mentosz09: Sounds like you need a hire a fluffer luxthoKEK
[0:34:56] ridewitheden: they just let the dough rise for longer properly
[0:34:58] ectoman1ac: not enough air pockets = underproofed (which was from not enough yeast like you said)
[0:35:01] GrimGoreRMW: @mentosz09 luxthoKEK
[0:35:03] Feisti718: might be a yeast/ rising issue
[0:35:03] Skoonta: is that from mixing it too much?
[0:35:07] nickolidakota: so many factors for that... resting temps, type of yeast, sifted flour..
[0:35:15] nickolidakota: takes a lifetime to master
[0:35:18] remli1991: european slices are like 50% thinner then what i had in canada
[0:35:22] ermymunster: Yeah looks fine to me
[0:35:24] ridewitheden: yeah that's perfectly fine for home made
[0:35:25] cathmeill: wow !
[0:35:28] mentosz09: @GrimGoreRMW Thank god someone else understood that lol
[0:35:29] Feisti718: that’s by a good loaf of bread from a fancy bakery is expensive haha
[0:35:37] Lemon_King: Looks fine, might depends on their yeast they used too.
[0:35:49] Aggy: I sent you a couple advices for next time
[0:35:58] nivlars15: my brother ate my loaf bread that was stored for about 3 weeks (totally forgot about it) and unfortunately, it has...
[0:35:58] Gummybeard1: Hairy bread, yummy
[0:36:09] HunterDeLupin: yeah same looks fine, as long as there's no raw dough in the center
[0:36:16] ectoman1ac: Lux it's perfectly fine for your first loaf, it's better than most first attempts, you have to get used to your oven's temp (ovens tend to lie about their actual temps), your home's temp and humidity. If you keep on trying to make bread, you'll start to get a feel for when the bread is proofed enough for the oven.
[0:36:35] ectoman1ac: my first attempt was a literal brick.
[0:36:55] Daemoos6: next time, he'll use the proper TEAspoon LUL
[0:37:00] Feisti718: your gonna have a lot of bread haha
[0:37:00] Lemon_King: @Luxthos Fun fact: Add cheese to your bread for a good time
[0:37:01] maz2080: yes
[0:37:01] ectoman1ac: there's a pressure test to see if it's proof enough too
[0:37:02] HunterDeLupin: could have
[0:37:03] Aggy: How long did you work the dough for
[0:37:07] nickolidakota: yeah a good internal thermometer is key
[0:37:14] jmalmin: Gauntlet dungeon in season 3? what is that? A endless type of dungeon?
[0:37:15] Aggy: How long did you bake the bread
[0:37:28] Aggy: OH NO
[0:37:32] ectoman1ac: yeah rounding the dough
[0:37:37] Feisti718: oh yeah you took all the air out!
[0:37:38] mentosz09: SHE DID WHAT TO IT?!?
[0:37:45] Aggy: This lady is an idiot lol
[0:37:52] ectoman1ac: but if you round it, you have to let it proof again LUL
[0:37:55] ectoman1ac: usually
[0:37:59] Aggy: You should NEVER deflate a bread right before baking
[0:38:06] Aggy: you deflate it ONCE after bulk rise
[0:38:07] Feisti718: but it might have been a different recipie that required that
[0:38:19] Aggy: ^^^^^
[0:38:21] Feisti718: that should be done and then do a second rise
[0:38:26] GrimGoreRMW: luxthoKEK
[0:38:28] Tzarrus: lol
[0:38:32] mentosz09: Gotta hate when you take it out and play with it too much
[0:38:34] Aggy: Lux playing with buns luxthoGasm
[0:38:39] ermymunster: THIS JUST IN, Millionaire StreamerTM admits that he plays with himself too much, more at 11 luxthoNews
[0:38:40] jmalmin: You didnt let the bread rise for a 2nd time?

[0:39:14] Aggy: You look like you mixed two recipes
[0:39:14] Feisti718: yeah not playing with it after the rise
[0:39:20] ectoman1ac: brian langerstrom on YT has good simple bread recipes, he has professional baker experience before becoming a YT cook, i follow his bread recipes and they all turn out great.
[0:39:26] Baladore: Bread is definitely a make mistakes and learn type of baking.

[0:41:25] StreamElements:  Want to buy or fund anything for us to open, craft or build on stream? https://throne.com/luxthos
[0:41:28] ectoman1ac: honestly for first attempt at bread that is a 7/10 to me (brick bread being a 0)
[0:41:42] cichlid722: You have a little more luck if your dough is under-proofed. If you’ve baked an under-proofed loaf it will likely have some random bubbles on the outer edges but be more more dense in the center because the gluten hasn’t had time to fully develop. You’ll likely notice the bread looks fine (if a bit misshapen) around the edges, but the middle is gummy and dense.
[0:42:23] ectoman1ac: even the way you cut for expansion affects the bread rising in oven too LUL
[0:42:27] Sarocus: Bread baking skill +8xp
[0:42:36] aliallz: you did a tablespoon instead of the teaspoon lol
[0:43:17] ectoman1ac: yeah if anything, remember to be patient and wait for it to fully cool down
[0:43:37] paintednpierced: he plays with his bread folks you heard it
[0:43:43] ermymunster: Wait, you fucked your bread? D:
[0:43:49] ermymunster: Maybe that's why it didn't come out perfect
[0:43:50] GrimGoreRMW: @paintednpierced i mean, don't we all? Kappa
[0:43:55] Aggy: he doesnt know how to handle thicc buns
[0:43:57] ermymunster: YOU SAID IT

[2:49:36] sunnysoka: Is it possible to have WA customizations different between multi-target and single-target talent specs?
[2:49:42] Daemoos6: How's Ravensdawn been Julia
[2:49:56] sunnysoka: okie :)
[2:50:18] Tinit5190: nascent aspects dream
[2:50:18] RyzuxTV: @sunnysoka wdym
[2:50:20] FMRSilva: I remember when I used to play to use your WA as a template then I changed them to my preference just in position etc, because the functions were perfect
[2:50:28] Julia: Daemoos6 its very addicting and some features are reeeally good (like the archetypes mix and cards), some other stuff needs fixing like the stairs/exit areas not being visible enough
[2:50:59] sunnysoka: Oooh gotcha!!
[2:51:05] RyzuxTV: dayum
[2:51:16] Pheoris: You should see what Loppy did for me... He tweaked your WAs to add 3 other WAs into it for Rogue, to help me out :D
[2:51:23] Daemoos6: did you rename the WAs with the name changes?
[2:51:54] sunnysoka: Do you actually have to manip the code itself?
[2:52:23] malaano: am I crazy or do you not track Awakened Jadefire for MW?
[2:52:50] malaano: its the buff from standing in jadefire stomp
[2:52:59] mccrackasaur: you absolutely do
[2:53:06] mentosz09: Party pizza for lunch
[2:53:23] Daemoos6: Warrior also had skills renamed
[2:53:27] Ckraigfriend: there is a new talen also for monks
[2:53:40] malaano: maybe use the pixel glow if you have the buff?
[2:54:06] Daemoos6: Put a red pixel glow if missing the buff?
[2:54:14] Daemoos6: or turn the icon red

[2:55:00] mentosz09: Rest assured there is a timer when inside....
[2:55:47] malaano: I would argue knowing if you have this buff is way more important than knowing the duration of your active jadefire
[2:55:48] Daemoos6: is it the same spell id
[2:55:52] mentosz09: Ohhh we're talking about the new spelll
[2:56:11] DarkBeasty_: hiii
[2:56:22] mentosz09: luxthoHmm 100% was off topic
[2:56:34] DarkBeasty_: i looted a head piece yesterday in lfr and sold it for 175k at the AH
[2:56:39] Ronangic: can you do it like you did Spear of Bastion? just a border around the icon when you are in?
[2:56:44] DarkBeasty_: cohhPls cohhPls cohhPls
[2:56:57] mentosz09: @DarkBeasty_ I'll take 3 lego sets please
[2:57:00] malaano: the current pixel glow doesn't really mean anything IMO. maybe i'll make the change on my own :D to use pixel glow for awakened jadefire
[2:57:50] malaano: yeah but you only care if you are in it. if it's out and you aren't in it, I don't really care
[2:57:55] StreamElements:  Did you miss one of the playthroughs or would like to watch it again? The new channel Luxthos Plays is now live -> https://www.youtube.com/@luxthosplays

[2:58:16] malaano: maybe personal preference thing
[2:58:17] DarkBeasty_: someone tried to get it for 10k KEKW
[2:58:19] mythicweetbix: how come they didn't change the icon to match the new spell/name?

[5:34:59] Peanutbeards: it's a 50/50. For some when they get max BiS loot they then quit because they got the best. While on the other side there are people like me who once getting full BiS actually play more because it's fun to destroy stuff with top gear.
[5:35:08] sargerik_: good evening

[5:37:10] VolicTV: @giggity360 Ya'll need some password vaults lol
[5:37:13] Mitchiegan: I'd play more characters too
[5:37:17] Peanutbeards: It's feels good to finally complete the gear. Now it's fun to play with max gear!
[5:37:35] mentosz09: Since retiring from organized raiding i just play for whatever i feel like usually getting KSM is the only must
[5:38:09] LazyPanzer: You can play forever because of alts

[5:45:50] mentosz09: Outlaw comes with carpal tunnel though
[5:46:01] Peanutbeards: I play my Prot War and it's ok, I get on my VDH and omg I have so much fun.

[5:48:19] Syprus1: im like that with mage i really wanna play one but i get to 30 and quit playing it and come back and im at a loss, so i restart rinse and repeat
[5:48:21] Megacheetah: To be fair, mythic plus teams should at least be looking at the raid to get gear just the same as a raider looks to mythic plus for gear
[5:48:29] mentosz09: BM>Prot>Ret is my top 3
[5:49:04] Syprus1: for me its outlaw>fury

[5:49:35] SaintTheFirst: DnD - frost/defile - make it stick to the char
[5:49:37] jfdesign: I wish they would find a way for frost to swap scythe instead of dnd for cleaving
[5:49:55] jfdesign: I love frost and the class fantasy it feels so shitty when the tank moves out of your dnd
[5:50:16] mentosz09: @SaintTheFirst I think you can macro it to cast on top of you

[5:51:23] paintednpierced: nevermind 60 and up... thats some bs
[5:51:35] mentosz09: I think if they made it to where DnD procced off like frost strike or something with a higher chance it would feel better

[5:59:12] Peanutbeards: get it right LUL
[5:59:21] GooseComics: They said most mounts will have Dynamic flying at the start, but not all of them. Which alludes to them still working on others @Luxthos
[5:59:30] Lemon_King: Dynamic Riding Mounts are being tested.
[5:59:35] Ealdfox: There's a new disk mount related to Hearthstone in the data that has dynamic flying animations luxthoHmm

[5:59:52] Vahs_Redclaw: from what i remember reading
[5:59:53] Peanutbeards: the court docs are online
[6:00:01] cannibalcanyon: i feel like mounts that fly without wings shouldnt get the dynamic flight based on functionality alone LUL
[6:00:10] malaano: LUL technicality
[6:00:14] GooseComics: huh?
[6:00:22] Sarocus: They got sued over it and had to pay anyone that had bought red bull in the past few years 10 bucks
[6:00:30] Sarocus: you just had to claim it
[6:00:43] cannibalcanyon: oh yeah, i got a free redbull because of that lawsuit
[6:00:53] malaano: "Serving Suggestion"
[6:00:58] mentosz09: Who actually drinks redbull?
[6:01:05] Ealdfox: The chars in the ads don't sprout wings either

[6:01:45] Discard_TV: That's not what they got sued for.  They got sued for false advertising.
[6:01:46] mentosz09: If i drink any energy drink it's the strawberry dream monster redbull tastes so bad
[6:01:51] Voidthos: City of Heroes/City of Villains
[6:01:53] Mazerbeam: If you need quick energy eat some carbs
[6:02:04] TheCyberianMonk: A US citizen named Benjamin Carethers questioned – “Why doesn’t RedBull give me wings?”  He sued the company for ‘false advertising. He claimed that after 10 years of drinking Red Bull, he had neither grown wings nor had seen any athletic or intellectual enhancement in his performance.
[6:02:08] mentosz09: @LuiBMHunter I've seen stupid people all over the world
[6:02:16] Finiin: You can still play city of heros
[6:02:17] cannibalcanyon: yeah it was because it didnt infact give you wings LUL

[6:02:50] Pheoris: I just got back from a meeting... WUT?
[6:02:52] Pheoris: lol
[6:03:00] Sarocus: Red bull lost the suit and had to pay anyone that claimed it 10 bucks
[6:03:03] Zladar: In my country it still say wing but in our language
[6:03:05] mentosz09: Surprised it wasn't deemed a frivolous lawsuit
[6:03:05] Voidthos: Happy Birthday Pheoris!
[6:03:13] Pheoris: @Voidthos NOPE pheoriNotMyBday

[6:03:33] Ealdfox: They don't show people sprouting wings in the ads either
[6:03:36] Peanutbeards: They were sued too over the statement they are the best energy drink, when infact scientists proved certain blends of coffee can have more caffine than red bull.
[6:03:44] GooseComics: @Ealdfox yeah they did
[6:03:49] mentosz09: Then again Ernie Chambers a state legislator in Nebraska sued god....
[6:03:55] malaano: @DarkBeasty_ this was actually legitimate. she got fucked up. it's sad
[6:03:58] Sarocus: @DarkBeasty_ that particular coffee was way too hot, though. She got burned pretty bad
