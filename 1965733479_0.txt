[1:38:03] denflup: 2 hours before or some shit
[1:38:03] dysc00: Cata classic?
[1:38:06] XLcoj: Last year they leaked the drakthyr and evoker around this time before the event
[1:38:06] Masqerader: blizzard just registered this trademark etc
[1:38:09] Snabido: @Poriand Dragon housing CoolCat
[1:38:19] Metalcalfe: IMO player housing is the last thing they need to fix lol
[1:38:22] ReinholdtRanger: Return to Northrend expansion?
[1:38:22] Heekss: Pirate xp for sure Kappa
[1:38:24] Poriand: @Snabido BibleThump
[1:38:25] duffluv22: Avaloren real?
[1:38:42] brentosxd: When they leaked evoker ppl called it bullshit haha
[1:38:46] slapdash16: maybe bill gates guest speaker lol
[1:38:50] XLcoj: Underground nerubian and dwarven old god expansion
[1:38:58] Shishir567: I thought the screenshots were debunked as AI
[1:39:07] Armdel: is someone spamming F5 on the blizza press center page
[1:39:23] bypized: Doesnt mean that Blizzard cant use AI KEKW
[1:39:23] RagingPunk: it looked generic not gona lie
[1:39:29] Heero_Effect: I think the new expansion will have characters from WoW in it
[1:39:36] dracullus: doesnt even matter cause these screenshots doesnt even tell you what expac will be about
[1:39:42] ReinholdtRanger: If those screenshots is from an Feature Trailer, compared to the dragonflight one its really bad...  and looks homemade
[1:39:52] Sollice: @Towelliee There is a National Lampoons Christmas Vacation slot machine?
[1:40:00] XLcoj: legion was the most hyped i was for an reveal and xpac :D those demon hunters are pog

[1:40:02] brentosxd: graphics dont even come close to dragonflight imo
[1:40:22] Garjo59: @towelliee I genuinely don't feel any kind of excitement towards retail or any new expansions. I'm totally drawn into classic and hopes of a classic plus announcement
[1:40:31] dracullus: I think they are fake, but man made
[1:40:33] XLcoj: He knowwws
[1:40:35] Thoreya: i aint listening to anyone, dracthyr was leaked and everyone dismissed it
[1:40:40] Thoreya: would not be surprised if those pics are real
[1:41:09] RagingPunk: it would be a strange name for xp sounds out of place to me
[1:41:10] Metalcalfe: I'm the opposite, I only care about retail, classic feels not permanent and a waste of time to me.
[1:41:24] Zwarx32: after wacthing the tourney i wanna play wow so bad
[1:41:29] dracullus: @Thoreya but that was original thought, not avalaren something something storming algarians

[1:41:46] kaijoe_: Even if it's real, thosse are 4 static images... you can't tell shit from that about the expac as a whole
[1:41:54] MoodyVanessa: even the bolvar one people said it was fake for Shadowlands
[1:42:02] RagingPunk: true dat

[1:42:26] hxrvick: when i was in azure span and saw the floating stack i was like "occulus 2.0" if you only saw that you'd have different opinion vs plains or something
[1:42:30] RagingPunk: i miss those legion class halls lol
[1:42:47] kaijoe_: You could replace "Avaloren" with "The Broken Isles" and folks would believe it fit,
[1:42:48] dysc00: Do you think they are gonna combine blizzard games with game pass?
[1:42:56] johniiv: Let's be honest too. World of Warcraft Avalorien don't sound very appealing. It would be something like WoW Undergrounds Realm or WoW Sourthern Iles
[1:43:09] Akermay: Ironforge 2.0 hub city would be amazing
[1:43:18] Thoreya: the logo was storms of avaloren
[1:43:21] RagingPunk: gnome expansion next Kappa
[1:43:24] Thoreya: if its real, that sounds better
[1:43:27] Zwarx32: dark iron dwarves are the coolest race
[1:43:38] Alepouditsa: but you will need a shrinking potion to get in it
[1:43:42] Metalcalfe: I don't see them making the title of an expansion a word no one is familiar with.
[1:44:03] RagingPunk: cata man thats all i care about right now
[1:44:08] duffluv22: Story of the 3 Hammers needs a wrap up.
[1:44:28] Metalcalfe: Yes
[1:44:37] Thoreya: battle for azeroth lol
[1:45:06] Milanesa_De_Pollo: Pandaria was only a name of a location
[1:45:24] erageK: @Metalcalfe dumb arguement avaloren and these specific dwarfes have been talked all dragonflight and prepatch of df its not something unknown tbh

[1:46:22] xziyn: You're playing Brew next tier?
[1:47:06] erageK: ye avaloren definetly will be the general zone we don't really know the name of the next expansion
[1:47:16] Metalcalfe: I'm not saying it won't be Avaloren, just that naming the expansion just "Avaloren" is a marketing mistake in my opinion, as it won't draw people back in who aren't playing, as they have no idea what that is.
[1:47:35] erageK: @Metalcalfe nobody says the name of the expac will be avaloren
[1:47:43] Xoyzor: Avaloren is a continent so def not
[1:47:44] Armdel: fogs of avaloren
[1:47:45] Thoreya: storms of avaloren
[1:47:47] Thoreya: yup
[1:47:51] Metalcalfe: The fake leak did

[1:48:06] raldrik: pirate doodle druids of avaloren
[1:48:07] brentosxd: Just give me gilneas revamp and im happy
[1:48:10] Sylphy_TV: Toddlers of Tyr
[1:48:23] erageK: @Metalcalfe the leak states the zone like Broken isles or Zuldazar
[1:48:23] Silverwards: World of Warcraft: Boaty McBoatface
[1:48:26] hxrvick: blizz should have 1 guy whos job it is to mess with leakers. throw up new pages "on accident" to throw trails off
[1:48:27] Ellycat1: Like 1 image?

[1:49:00] Mynty_Fresh: Pull the whole room use the chains to 1 shot them all.
[1:49:03] Milanesa_De_Pollo: Towelliee is talking about the screenshot with the Tinker
[1:49:04] Akermay: This the expac that confirms flat Azeroth?
[1:49:22] tlsmith3638: Pirates of Avaloren  you just watch
[1:49:22] drakehandmoonruner: Niffen expansion we going under the "sword that doesn't exist" finally
[1:49:24] erageK: i really dont want an underground expac to be fair zaralec was enough for me towBlind
[1:49:28] Masqerader: @Mynty_Fresh its bursting they will all explode
[1:49:31] CloudPants8081: amiloScary  he knows
[1:49:35] Heero_Effect: Is preach gonna play it?
[1:49:35] tlsmith3638: The no pirates was a red herring
[1:49:40] Mynty_Fresh: 3 ppl or so all use the chain big damge

[1:49:45] darkh79: if I were blizzard I'd be creating fake leaks at this point just so any real leaks are obscured. keep the surprise
[1:49:51] Masqerader: remember its bursting too
[1:50:01] Mynty_Fresh: You and 2 others yeah
[1:50:08] Mynty_Fresh: Big hit and dot
[1:50:09] Masqerader: ton of damage and stuns them
[1:50:11] hxrvick: stuuns and each break is 6m dmg

[1:50:13] wmadsen: Chains stun them, like it does the boss you're approaching
[1:50:54] Masqerader: but it is also bursting so blowing them all up at the same time in say a group of 8 to 10 without mass dispel is suicide lol
[1:52:07] Mynty_Fresh: True no AMS or mass dispell. Thats fair to be carful.
[1:52:08] Molvonos: Not with that attitude.
[1:52:14] Molvonos: Go big or go home
[1:52:43] erageK: fortified bursting is pretty bad to be honest
[1:53:01] Blackminuz: your using elvui?
[1:53:10] MizixTV: They seem to like the 1 word titles right now so I‚Äôm guessing something like Stormsurge or Stormbreaker as the title. They both sound good in my head with Metzen hyping up the crowd and hearing him say Stormbreaker or Stormsurge just brings hype.
[1:53:26] ohnot___her: Are we getting announcments during opening ceremony?
[1:53:29] ashwing_: I mean Uldaman hints and also the notes from Deathwing pretty much say a lot
[1:53:44] nezz231: are like 4 clans or something?
[1:53:45] Masqerader: red shirt guy looking like charlie day in sunny in philly with that conspiracy meme
[1:53:50] Masqerader: he got it all figured out
[1:53:54] erageK: ye whole expansion gave much story for a lore junkie :P
[1:53:55] Blackminuz: what UI are you using?
[1:54:07] Molvonos: There's as many dwarves as Blizz needs to create.
[1:54:09] Xoyzor: + there are earthen dwarves
[1:54:15] Blackminuz: !addon

[1:54:34] Molvonos: @Sollice Snowed this morning, still snowing
[1:54:43] Sollice: Oh. We got a little last night
[1:54:43] HaloS23: @Towelliee come to think of it. Lets say half of Azeroth fell under the order side like the aspects and us currently, What it there is another half that fell under the Elemental side like the Incarnates?
[1:54:57] Masqerader: stormspike?
[1:55:05] Silassio: lgbtqia+ dwarves
[1:55:15] Molvonos: @Sollice Vega went outside and immediately came back inside, despite being a cat built for snow.
[1:55:21] fcsgamer: he will read too much into it
[1:55:28] Wulfgrym: bellular is hiring body language experts to watch all of towelliees vods probably LUL
[1:55:28] tealtalk91: still vapin bro? whats your current setup
[1:55:35] fcsgamer: @Towelliee looks way too interested in the dwarven clans@"
[1:55:39] Blackminuz: oh thought elvui didnt work on retail?
[1:55:54] Sollice: @Molvonos Yeah mine is too young this year, but next year I would imagine she would like to go out in it
[1:56:01] Sollice: Hopefully she is massive for a maine coon
[1:56:06] Sollice: coone
[1:56:13] medanmarko: Accoridng to the wiki there are BronzebeardStormpikeRom's clan, Dark Iron, Shadowforge, Doyle, Dunwald, Firebeard, MacDuff, Moore, Mullan, Thundermar, Wildhammer and Frostborn. I've just copy+pasted them here.

[1:56:36] captivate7: wildhammer, bronzebeard, and dark iron?
[1:56:47] HaloS23: think northrend
[1:56:48] Molvonos: You wanna start anything you wanna do when they're young, @Sollice.  Get her used to water, for baths, snow, anything.
[1:56:48] Armdel: im sure you know that better than us Kappa
[1:56:56] Ellycat1: Non curse of flesh dwarves in northrend.

[1:58:13] FlameStryke: that a custom one?
[1:58:21] Molvonos: @Sollice Let her investigate it herself.  Like, a sink/tub barely filled, perhaps with a toy or two in there (i have these little battery operated fishthings).  But yea, Luna, my Russian Blue, acts as if i'm trying to kill her if I try to bathe her.

[1:59:35] Heero_Effect: @xziyn danPanic
[1:59:37] Wulfgrym: magni appears on the trailer and all these people in the crowd have PTSD attacks and fall on the ground.
[1:59:41] Sollice: New Expansion, we get our Heart and Legendary back to level. That would be nice
[1:59:56] Sollice: We need ALL the borrowed power
[2:00:14] lolFedaz: Jesus I hated the heart and legendary
[2:00:15] ParfumAmerican: don't tell me there is a connection between Fyrakk and the Jailer
[2:00:17] nezz231: Magni was the leader of bronzebeard but sacrifice himself in cata and then became the speaker of azeroth
[2:00:17] Rhiinehart: it does a lot of dmg for me
[2:00:22] Masqerader: At least we won't have to deal with Wrathion saying "i got these cloaks dawg"
[2:00:23] totemdropa: @sollice and artifact weapons
[2:00:29] Sollice: Legendary was cool. We need agrind again like that
[2:00:33] Wulfgrym: @Sollice we need to heal the wuuns! dwarves probably been mining sargaras's sword underground!
[2:00:38] erageK: hear me champion azeroth needs ye take this liver of azeroth as your new neck

[2:02:03] maane97: How was bear on ptr?
[2:02:09] Sollice: Oh anyone here try PTR Hunters? BM or MM good?
[2:02:35] ohnot___her: MM Copium
[2:02:39] Vapo: MM barely got anything but casino spec nerf, BM most likely the play
[2:02:58] adxx: I feel like Bear is always underwhelming the majority of patches. not a bad choice but just in general, they feel so mid
[2:03:02] Sollice: Ok. trying to decide Havoc or hunter for 10.2 come back
[2:03:13] neftario105: is Survival any good?
[2:03:16] Sollice: I think I am more suited to range because I am too lazy in melee
[2:03:17] Vapo: havoc is god tier spec
[2:03:28] Sollice: yeah I know
[2:03:42] Sollice: Its easier to be a baddy at ranged though
[2:03:46] Heero_Effect: @sollice melee is too much work
[2:03:51] neftario105: Hunter Survival?
[2:03:58] Sollice: @Heero_Effect I agree
[2:04:04] Masqerader: @Sollice i am doing both assassination rogue and havoc, mostly havoc though, with fodder gone, and momentum lasting longer shouldn't be as abad
[2:04:13] neftario105: @hxrvick thanks have a great day
[2:04:19] Sollice: I like fodder being gone, but I hate momentum
[2:04:20] Korupcija_: two sleeps PogChamp
[2:04:36] Heero_Effect: Shadowlands was rough playing melee
[2:04:43] Masqerader: ya
[2:04:46] Esmond_Kirk: Good morning y'all
[2:04:56] neftario105: @hxrvick thanks üòä
[2:05:01] xziyn: @Sollice Fodder is amazing, wdym, one of my favourite abilities
[2:05:03] Sollice: Yep
[2:05:06] Sollice: Its donezo
[2:05:25] Sollice: The last iteration with having to use spectral site to see it was dumb
[2:05:31] Sollice: Just button bloat
[2:05:33] Moobot: Ask a moderator for permission before posting a link, @hxrvick (warning)
[2:05:35] Quikbeard: Hold up. Fodder to the flame for havoc is gone?
[2:05:40] Masqerader: whoever came up linking it to spectral sight, was a special kind of person
[2:05:42] Sollice: Yeah it is
[2:06:05] xziyn: @Sollice Heard the talent was gone but it was baseline?
[2:06:06] Moobot:  Towelliee.com has all of your Towelliee news WoW UI addon information, and merchandise collection. Check it out!
[2:06:27] Masqerader: i will say though, the current fodder of flame as crappy as it was, saved me quite a few times with it heal
[2:06:30] graybomb: I play a brewmaster tank, sub rogue, and resto in reeners so Im used to button chaos
[2:06:56] jessetenfour: brewmaster is so much fun. love the mobility
[2:07:03] Masqerader: btw you can pick up 2 of those
[2:07:05] Masqerader: if u wanted
[2:07:08] hxrvick: bloods always been just barely out of meta
[2:07:08] jessetenfour: I could spinning cranekick for forever and be content xD
[2:07:12] Sollice: @hxrvick That shows MM being on top I guess
[2:07:18] ohnot___her: VDH would like to speak to you lol
[2:07:24] thatguynamedjans: Did you play BrM after they fixed the bug that was empowering their tier by like 4X? i hear its a lot worse off now :(
[2:07:30] Sollice: @xziyn No I believe its completely gone now
[2:07:42] cattarn: cattarn subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 58 months! 
[2:07:54] hxrvick: @Sollice yeah this was updated today so guess thats the more current
[2:08:03] Masqerader: do they not know there is a break between the explosion u can wait out
[2:09:11] Masqerader: btw towelliee u can pick up 2 of the gold piles if they're close enough and use them back to back
[2:09:24] thatguynamedjans: I heard the DR for BrM tier basically falls off instantly after they fixed the bug :( but I havent tested personally
[2:09:36] Polebows: do you think brew will be good for raiding too? choosing tanks for raid besides dk this tier is kinda strange

[2:18:52] Sollice: ordered from their website
[2:18:55] Heero_Effect: Do you think more people will play the new expansion? Or probably same amount as DF
[2:19:19] kyotoboss: @BoezIRL sadge, I'm feeling that
[2:19:34] BobLongMVP: Y‚Äôall are crazy I ain‚Äôt buying drugs in the mail. No thanks
[2:19:56] Sollice: @boblongmvp It's THC its not like I am ordering coke from some dark web vendor lol
[2:20:00] 6all: Yeah i agree with that
[2:20:23] Sollice: Regardless it didnt work for me other than making me hungry. I have a huge tolerance for things making me sleep after 20 years of solid insomnia
[2:20:41] Sollice: RSO didnt work for me either
[2:21:35] Metalcalfe: @boblongmvp I live in canada, there's multiple weed stores on every block lol.

[2:27:41] Meanseason: i knew a crafter who basically made gold cap just off selling ele lariat and a few other items to the whales.
[2:27:55] atowellthatiallreadyused: K-pop on blizzcon , back in the days i remember in flames x D
[2:28:05] Zivs: the recipie for lariat sold for like 5m+ alone
[2:28:10] valianya: They Need catchup for professions because its locking players out of even trying, so only the already rich gold goblin crafters are getting the lion's share of the markets
[2:28:11] wEiRdO_dUdE: Yeah the lariat crafters were making disgusting gold
[2:28:13] Meanseason: yep it was wild
[2:28:14] Sylphy_TV: jeebus
[2:28:18] Masqerader: early on i was getting like 60k for lariats
[2:28:25] Masqerader: from the progress guilds
[2:28:29] Molvonos: Curious to see what the next expansion's lariat is gonna be.
[2:29:03] Sylphy_TV: i hope they keep it
[2:29:11] Olieburgz: bring back artifact weapons
[2:29:22] atowellthatiallreadyused: could been baby metal instead so im not complaining
[2:29:25] AjaxGamingTTV: gonna try one more time with the HH?
[2:29:25] Artenuous: @Molvonos itll be a ring instead of a neck ;)
[2:29:26] Gruffian: New crafting system has been a big success I think. Crafting is finally relevant again outside of profession bonuses.
[2:29:36] Masqerader: its over
[2:29:37] TheGiant99: They need to make it so you don't need others to make your stuff
[2:29:41] AjaxGamingTTV: nope... you can still que
[2:29:51] valianya: Profession system needs better catchup mechanics
[2:29:51] karaste: 11am
[2:29:53] Masqerader: should have ended at noon
[2:29:55] macanudo17: @towelliee Colts should tank for Marvin Harrison Jr. - thoughts?

[2:30:05] Milanesa_De_Pollo: don't forget to buy the day of the dead saddle
[2:30:23] Treevinal: yeah day of the dead starts at 10am
[2:30:33] Molvonos: DAY OF THE DEAD SADDLE?  WHAT?
[2:30:37] Jango_: colts need to get their defense situated imo
[2:30:39] Wulfgrym: when your WR gets pissed off you fire your HC and GM
[2:31:04] Peepoblink: @Towelliee Do you think they will announce cata classic?
[2:31:06] duffluv22: Steelers need an O line.
[2:31:12] tmiguel27: Foam Sword Rank PogChamp
[2:31:15] Cavalree: McDaniel had it coming though
[2:31:18] yoriiiii_: scroll of resurrection from back in the day
[2:31:28] Ccbighit23: looking slim bro
[2:31:39] tryptich23: how likely is classic +?
[2:31:56] Wulfgrym: @Cavalree there was some massive problems in the lockerroom if they fired him with like 4.5 years left on his guaranteed contract
[2:32:13] macanudo17: @jango_ agreed, defense is a problem Shaq Leonard not the same
[2:32:22] Rozmatics: cata isn't classic, its when things really started changing
[2:32:23] luchion09: what was the curse thingy u did at the begining ? @Towelliee
[2:32:39] Thewunk: I really don't like the idea of Cata classic. I think they should just keep with the first 2 Xpacks
[2:32:43] lithium364: WoD classic PogChamp
[2:32:43] Collected1: the pro play would be doing something that gets people buying a Classic expansion
[2:32:52] denflup: metzen working on retail expansions, according to bellular "sources"
[2:32:52] justagamingfiend: I think the classic + is just going to be classic with new graphics
[2:32:58] PigPenLen: yeah the angelic resonance set that released in d4 def has crusader vibes for sure
[2:33:04] Molvonos: World of Warcraft Cataclysm: REEEEEdux
[2:33:15] Collected1: no one wants cataclysm
[2:33:16] neverbornlucky: but towelliee preach says no more expansions from blizzard remember
[2:33:18] Heero_Effect: accoClown
[2:33:24] Metalcalfe: Scataclysm. :(
[2:33:36] yib_: Collected1 id rather play cata then wrath
[2:33:46] GGlake: Vanilla+ lol
[2:33:48] Meanseason: id welcome it tbh. i STILL feel cata and mop had the very best class design of all wow expansions.
[2:33:50] emznev: mop?
[2:33:53] Rozmatics: wow was the most watched videogame on twitch during the makgora tournament
[2:33:56] KutzTV: Thoughts on warrior trading post set Savage Champion's Aggression donning the seals of Gilneas and Lordaeron?
[2:33:57] errkkk_: its going to be classic + cata , makes sense they'd want to make cata better out of the gate
[2:34:13] ryanacheson1991: Honestly I think we‚Äôre getting cata classic with changes and an announcement of diabloesque seasons for classic era

[2:37:51] Molvonos: @daily_distraction Your first mistake is thinking you wont get tilted in pvp, regardless of class.

[3:21:25] Jarlan23: one day theyll have foo fighters
[3:21:30] xziyn: They need to attract young people at some point though lol
[3:21:32] wEiRdO_dUdE: I think last time it was Metallica, yeah
[3:21:36] tlsmith3638: Or used to be
[3:21:40] ambiotic: Weird Al and Metallica were the best one
[3:21:42] ambiotic: s*
[3:21:48] RavenARPG: K-pop‚Ä¶lol
[3:21:55] Heero_Effect: Wonder if Phil will be there
[3:21:56] koko316: I am going to see Metallica in Edmonton in August it is a 2 day concert. I am pumped
[3:21:58] Baldarsar: i was hoping for the band at the  end ceromony for something like big, green day or something like that. and for K-pop something more known. never heard of that band
[3:22:00] ambiotic: Muse was ok too
[3:22:02] Anthropophob: K-Pop -- Hentai -- Old God Tentacles. I see rhe connection
[3:22:04] Metalcalfe: I liked when they had ozzy he sprayed the front row with water, and all the people in cosplay were mortified lol
[3:22:20] Kolepto: Are you doing a mog run or working on trading post?
[3:22:23] MILESkg21: i see where this is going
[3:22:30] neftario105: What class is the easiest to learn ?
[3:22:52] kithelle: The music they pick for the show gives you an idea of what they think of the franchise.  More up-beat and happier where it used to be more gritty.  Happy dragons for everyone
[3:23:00] atowellthatiallreadyused: i remember in flames have been there
[3:23:04] sifer007: just give us classic plus
[3:23:07] Treevinal: @neftario105 always hunter
[3:23:07] pragmacktic: for a billion dollars they could get tswift in there
[3:23:19] zombie_snacks666: I'm sure it also has something to do with the potential of the closing Concert being streamed. After Metallica got the dmca thing on the closing ceremony
[3:23:20] xziyn: This fight killed SO MANY guilds lol
[3:23:26] futomara01: blizzard: hold my beer
[3:23:28] MILESkg21: dark animus still gives me nightmares
[3:23:42] Sylphy_TV: it killed friebships
[3:23:52] Timbuk91: i HATED progging this boss
[3:24:00] devildriver1919: you were supposed to kill all the adds on top of boss

[3:24:45] xziyn: Durumu was the LFR killer
[3:24:54] napsfly: why are u doing panda lfrs
[3:25:04] devildriver1919: i may be forgetting everything else but bosses and wow lore, shits engraved into my brain

[3:25:45] LehBiscuit: @napsfly transmog, the true endgame
[3:25:56] kithelle: The OTK tournament really show cased classics popularity. They need to do classic+
[3:26:04] neverbornlucky: Shadowlands Classic you ALL ARE GOING TO LOVE IT
[3:26:05] sidebo20: Coming back to the game for the new season will prot pally  be strong ?
[3:26:32] Metket: left one
[3:26:33] CordialWaffle: i remember you actually doing this raid back when it was live man. lol
[3:26:34] devildriver1919: other door
[3:26:41] Fynale: I mean castle nathria has come up in LFR like 3 times during dragonflight
[3:26:49] MrGharr: fated -> dreaming season maybe?
[3:26:59] Valseki: @kithelle Also shows people are motivated by money
[3:27:08] denflup: based
[3:27:17] crymeog: lol doesnt take a tournament to figure that out
[3:27:18] MILESkg21: insane they had 300k for the Tourney yesterday
[3:27:23] Thewunk: How many attempts do you have for this mount @Towelliee
[3:27:23] Selvek: Out of the loop a bit, what is Classic Plus?
[3:27:25] WoWRoach: I think 100k dollars is where that popularity came from.  You don't think you would see the same if it was done on retail?
[3:27:29] Sicknessqt: even wrath classic have way more players than HC, but HC is insanely popular on twitch
[3:27:31] Valseki: I wonder if classic+ will use the world revamp we've been hearing about
[3:27:34] wEiRdO_dUdE: People like watching streamers die in Hardcore, it's fun
[3:27:35] ashwing_: mans based his stats on Esfand viewer numbers LUL
[3:27:36] devildriver1919: classic community is biased that Df ruined the game
[3:27:41] Heero_Effect: Classic has the nostalgia factor too where we had all the time in the world to mess around
[3:27:48] Rictamar: I wouldn't be surprised if classic was played more than retail, but we can only speculate
[3:27:53] cipusanx: well, when your class design is a christmass tree, no wonder people prefer classic
[3:27:56] Thewunk: Oh right on! Are you just getting transmogs then?
[3:28:03] luchion09: @Towelliee have u made a char on wrath classic
[3:28:10] AlphasaurusRexx: @devildriver1919 they say that every exansion
[3:28:14] Valseki: I thought every xpac ruined he game for classic players?
[3:28:15] mavericks312: Also you guys are mistaking classic WoW with classic hardcore for viewership also
[3:28:26] ArcaneSyntax: it's always "Current expansion ruined the game" with classic andies

[3:28:35] BogzyMan: df ruined it? what did sl do then? LUL
[3:28:37] devildriver1919: and as df, i meant dungeon finder not dragonflight
[3:28:38] bypized: The viewership is on Classic HC not even Classic Classic
[3:28:47] Metket: classic is all about drama, we should bring more to retail Kappa
[3:28:57] Moobot: No need to repeat yourself, @sidebo20 (warning)
[3:29:06] Djulio: I don't get people asking for classic+? As if it won't be the same developers whose work on retail they don't like
[3:29:15] neverbornlucky: Towelliee lets go straight to shadowlands
[3:29:26] AlphasaurusRexx: the appeal to the tournament was 100+ streamers battling it out for $50k winners prize. if it was a bunch of randos with no prize money it wouldnt have any traction
[3:29:26] mavericks312: But if it wasn‚Äôt for the you die you restart classic wouldn‚Äôt have this kinda viewership let‚Äôs be honest
[3:29:30] neftario105: Hope @towelliee play Cata classic if it is announced
[3:29:49] Heero_Effect: Classic plus =WoW 2 accoCopee
[3:29:53] SSD511_: lvl 60 gank me for an hour at redridge mountains and i never log in since a month LUL
[3:29:53] xRykku: @Towelliee 2 things I would love to see for classic: Updated Auction House like retail and option to use updated character models
[3:29:54] Fynale: did you guys see that bungie apperently didn't hit what they thought D2 would do by like 45%
[3:29:59] dannyis1337: I can see them doing tbc or wrath hardcore
[3:30:09] maane97: Hardcore retail inc
[3:30:11] Valseki: @AlphasaurusRexx Yup - if there was a 100k retail tourney, we would also see a lot of people watching
[3:30:11] luchion09: thats nice
[3:30:19] wEiRdO_dUdE: Metzen stuff could be huge, true
[3:30:20] Myndjestyr: @AlphasaurusRexx thats literally just how sports works lmfao
[3:30:28] its_Xek: taurens can be rogues, but humans cant be shamans hmm
[3:30:28] neftario105: @maane97 don't think so
[3:30:37] Capulse: only reason it has the viewship is does is because content creators are doing a content "project " there. If they did a content project in retail people would watch retail
[3:30:45] mavericks312: @fynale most of D2‚Äôs players are pvper‚Äôs and the games PvP has been garbage for awhile
[3:30:51] ashwing_: Bungie is going down the Wildstar path
[3:31:04] Fynale: they layed off 100 employees and mostly community and sound ppl
[3:31:05] AlphasaurusRexx: @Myndjestyr  yes im aware. but calling classic as a whole incredibly popular based on one tournament is misguided
[3:31:17] Fynale: D2 is gonna die in the meantime
[3:31:21] Rictamar: The Final Shape sure is looking more and more like the end of Destiny lol
[3:31:24] neftario105: Bungie is slowly dying üò¢
[3:31:28] MisterPeace: yeah my compnay just layed off half the peeps, than they laid off half again somehow i dodged the razor lol
[3:31:39] Metket: @Myndjestyr  i watched it, i don't give a shit about classic so he is right
[3:31:46] mavericks312: @fynale at this point I think d2 will go into maintence mode after the last xpac and all focus goes toward marathon
[3:31:52] Folgrum: no way there will be tbc or wrath hc. but classic seasons every 6 months would be nice
[3:31:56] EvenstarTV: Layoffs happen all the time in almost every company in the world, but if a gaming company does it, they are evil.
[3:31:56] Moobot:  Help Towelliee reach the 1,000,000 followers goal. Click that heart button and join the Hammer Squad community!
[3:31:57] Folgrum: also cata classic :)
[3:31:58] bypized: PR NIGHTMARE
[3:32:02] Capulse: bungie  diverted to many resources to other projects, didnt leave any good talent on their money maker
[3:32:15] Fynale: @mavericks312 and marathon will die because that genre is flooded and it's just a trend

[3:32:19] abracka_: broooo
[3:32:20] Zivs: no shot
[3:32:21] wmadsen: Yeah, but COBRA is damned expensive.
[3:32:21] abracka_: what the fuck
[3:32:21] CosmicPooky: thats messed up
[3:32:21] Ezmaraldaa: That's cold
[3:32:26] MisterPeace: wow that is evil lol
[3:32:27] captivate7: wtf?
[3:32:32] wEiRdO_dUdE: That sounds cold
[3:32:33] kithelle: Sounds unethical
[3:32:34] Zivs: why would it not be 30 days that's crazy
[3:32:38] Valseki: COBRA is stupid expensive
[3:32:39] Chronollo: Did Blizz hint at anything related to cata classic? I tbh enjoyed cata myself but it was personal experience for me, it's when I met my gf who is my wife now lol
[3:32:42] Purgatan: That would be pretty terrible, most companies try to do it on the 1st to help ease the blow
[3:32:42] HaxzorJimDuggan: i saw another post that said the medical stayed until their severence pay ended
[3:32:42] MisterPeace: cobra i  super pricey
[3:32:45] SmallzzIV: Cobra is unemployed gap insurance
[3:32:46] johniiv: Not even, most of the time when you get layoff insurance stop the day of your last day
[3:32:46] devildriver1919: medical bill are outragous anyways
[3:32:49] Gingerprimer: Also a lot of them had stock options if they stayed with the company but now since they were fireded thoose ppl also lost that
[3:32:52] CloudPants8081: blame sony Kappa
[3:32:53] johniiv: I know since I got lay off yesterday :(
[3:32:54] WoWRoach: Same thing happened at my company and it was on a Friday.  HR claimed they didn't realize it.  Could have waited until Monday and everyone would have had a month to get coverage
[3:33:05] Valseki: Technically, in the US (in CT at least) - they only have to provide health insurance until the end of the current month
[3:33:05] wmadsen: COBRA lets you continue your health insurance w/o the portion your company paid - you have to pay it
[3:33:08] thatguynamedjans: Cobra is the health insurance they offer you to extend the health insurance from your previous employer after you get let go
[3:33:08] CousinAvi86: Cobra is temporary after you get laid off, essentially continues the plan you currently had but you pay out of pocket
[3:33:15] MrGharr: US employee regulations are so bad compared to EU
[3:33:16] devildriver1919: i just had a heart attack and stent put in, it was 6 figures for my hopsital bill
[3:33:17] mavericks312: @cloudpants8081 what? Bungie is fully independent still
[3:33:21] johniiv: Most of company is 2 years for stock options
[3:33:21] neftario105: @towelliee you playing cataclysm if it release on classic?
[3:33:21] CousinAvi86: expensive as fuck
[3:33:35] Fynale: apperently the head of playstation is stepping down soon
[3:33:47] mavericks312: No even though Sony owns them they remain independent after the acquisition
[3:33:50] Fynale: they laid off the girl who designed the halo logo
[3:33:53] chico_escuela: The implication was that it was not at the behest of Sony
[3:34:02] CloudPants8081: all part of phil spencers plan Kappa
[3:34:06] BogzyMan: that games been so bad for so long im surprised it took this long for it to catch up to them
[3:34:12] ArcaneSyntax: 2023 has been a great year for games, but a terrible year for devs
[3:34:16] PotbellyGoat: Merry Christmas, you're fired
[3:34:29] Heero_Effect: Bungie should Bobby kotick, they‚Äôll make so much money
[3:34:36] CloudPants8081: KEKW
[3:34:36] Sylphy_TV: LUL
[3:34:39] wEiRdO_dUdE: Whoa LUL
[3:34:40] Rictamar: bruh they even laid off the guy who made all the music and some of his team members...dude has been there since '97 lol

[3:34:50] kithelle: They need to take a page out of nintendo's book.  When they are down they cut top executives pay to keep staff.  Can't make products without staff
[3:34:50] snarkydonald: drink that moxie.
[3:34:59] mavericks312: That‚Äôs just xbot posting
[3:35:13] HaxzorJimDuggan: at least wait until after the holidays
[3:35:14] mavericks312: Ppl forget Xbox just laid off over 700 ppl as well
[3:35:17] neftario105: Xbox rules
[3:35:18] BogzyMan: lol
[3:35:20] hollowedlyfe: i am here so i wont be ban hammered
[3:35:24] CloudPants8081: PauseChamp
[3:35:25] abracka_: m night shamalyan type twist KEKW
[3:35:35] Rictamar: meanwhile Sony is set to make billions in profits this year and are sitting on a 14 billion dollar cash stack
[3:35:35] wEiRdO_dUdE: Oh yeah, Bobby got that stock price up
[3:35:35] neverbornlucky: I remember when I was let tgo from xerox for medical reasons. I just wanted them to fire me so I could go to medicaid over cobra lol
[3:35:41] Rictamar: lol its just insane
[3:35:44] Gingerprimer: Bobby was really good at making money
[3:35:45] johniiv: We're over 6000 video games Devs being layoff this year. It's the WORST year since industry started
[3:35:47] Fynale: he also knew how to lose his friends money with overwatch league
[3:35:58] dracullus: "Squeeze, Bobby. Squeeze hard."
[3:36:02] kithelle: History is a pretty good indicator that you don't need a heart to make a great businessman
[3:36:06] Fynale: but hey the guys on the board of Coke so
[3:36:09] Gingerprimer: @Fynale tbf baby money for those guys
[3:36:21] PotbellyGoat: could we lay off most of D4's devs
[3:36:23] mavericks312: @johniiv yea for as great as a year it was for gaming it was equally as bad on the dev front
[3:36:26] neverbornlucky: more lay offs at meta and X though
[3:36:36] ZeusDNA: They probably are swimming in money KEKW just now they're swimming in even more money
[3:36:50] MrGharr: but King is part of Actiblizz
[3:36:52] TaNGoIX: @PotbellyGoat They are people with families my guy. Devs do what leadership tell them to do. Braindead take.
[3:36:59] mavericks312: I think epic games layoffs were the most surprising
[3:37:20] d2darkalliance: @towelliee are you prepared for the sad news this weekend?
[3:37:30] Rictamar: the fact is they are swimming in money, and the executives will feel no effects from this...but that is capitalism for you
[3:37:32] neftario105: King is own by Microsoft
[3:37:34] rymerre: Epic needs to go under
[3:37:34] Lepprechaun25: King was kinda the reason ms bought activison/blizzard they wanted a mobile dev
[3:37:35] abracka_: we're just used to calling it actiblizz, true name is ABK
[3:37:38] BogzyMan: @TaNGoIX leadership doesnt tell them to make a bad game, there is such a thing as bad devs u know
[3:37:39] dannyis1337: it would make sense to move mobile games to the mobile company's though
[3:37:42] Dark_Kornax: @Towelliee Fortnight is dying.
[3:37:46] Fynale: well epic also lost a costly court case
[3:37:49] mavericks312: Epic games an Xbox had the biggest layoffs ai believe
[3:37:49] EvenstarTV: almost 1k i believe epic layoffs
[3:37:51] Rictamar: you won't see Bungie execs take pay cuts or less bonuses lol
[3:38:00] PotbellyGoat: @TaNGoIX difference of opinion. I don't think the game needs thousands of devs
[3:38:02] TaNGoIX: @BogzyMan Tell me you have never been in software development without telling me you have never been in software development
[3:38:05] wEiRdO_dUdE: Streamers always ruin the games LUL
[3:38:06] dracullus: doomsayers getting more miserable each year
[3:38:09] oldislive: bruh blizz done made me mad, the zhevra is now a trading post mount
[3:38:09] Crunker01: all of it
[3:38:13] MrGharr: should we call it MicroActiBlizzKing now_
[3:38:21] Fynale: i wonder if microsoft will keep abk under the same umbrella company or split them up
[3:38:44] BogzyMan: @TaNGoIX ye im a web developer, thats exactly why i know theres bad devs lol, but ok
[3:38:53] mavericks312: @fynale if they were to do anything like that it would be after 3-5 yrs to see how they operate
[3:39:00] Sylphy_TV: Active MicroBlizzard
[3:39:04] Esperz: Candy Crush + Warcraft Rumble
[3:39:06] neftario105: Microsoft buy Activision Blizzard and King @towelliee

[3:39:22] Velha_Senhora: do u think we will get a change on subscription methods?
[3:39:23] luchion09: wow tetris :P
[3:39:28] EvenstarTV: I swear the xbots on twitter already calling us WoW players as "Xbox" players now, while I only play games on PC/steam
[3:39:29] kyotoboss: wasn't there candy crush as a nazjatar wq ?
[3:39:32] Molvonos: @Mackemm73 towCopium towCopium towCopium towCopium
[3:39:37] TaNGoIX: @BogzyMan Then you should know, devs don't build shit that isn't decided upon at a leadership level. Blaming the direction of a game on the devs is just stupid
[3:39:38] HaloS23: @Towelliee imagine a WoW / Minecraft crossover!!!!

[4:10:45] xpadeDK: Hot take: I tried classic wrath wow and classic hardcore and I was bored as fk
[4:10:56] tenassity69: my rl friends all suck at wow so classic is where they play so i have to play it to play with then. w/e comes next, i hope it satiates my retail brain and brings the QOL stuff that WOTLK still fucks up. like hit and threat and dungeon rp and shit
[4:11:04] Relic7: WoW Classic Hardcore is really fun

[4:11:39] FlameStryke: @Towelliee the best thing Metzen can do with cata is Delete it and make a whole new one without deathwing
[4:11:45] snake_like: yea
[4:11:57] xpadeDK: Classic is just boring lol

[4:12:59] Metket: i want people to suffer on spine, let dw stays KEKW
[4:13:14] mavericks312: Wouldn‚Äôt they have to give retail any ‚Äúnew‚Äù content though like a raid or dungeon
[4:13:14] ItsNobbie: I think we get Classic Cata with Classic + being an alternate time path from 1-70 in Chromie Time
[4:13:21] rilefors: Only thing they should change imo is dragon soul @towelliee

[4:13:41] Bless59360: What if they're diverting the timeline? > _ >
[4:13:47] Quakezilla69: Maybe we can get that underwater raid that was cut during cata- there was a youtube video done on it
[4:13:54] FlameStryke: TBH retail has been so ret conned it wouldn't matter what they did with classic, let retail keep doing its things
[4:13:56] geokouts: 49 hours for the event!
[4:14:12] duffluv22: AU Cata...lol
[4:14:14] Myndjestyr: I just thought the point of classic was to go back to the game before there were decisions made that people didnt like, wouldn't making a classic+ eventually result in just a second retail?
[4:14:20] mavericks312: @flamestryke wrong you can‚Äôt alienate retail players like that
[4:14:20] HaloS23: C'thun actually won..... /shrug
[4:14:21] ZeusDNA: And if you change the timeline and continue on, now you have 2 retails lol
[4:14:32] Orthobullet: just chromie things
[4:14:34] zombie_snacks666: Classic + could just turn into a "what if" machine
[4:14:43] jeffnsteff2019: do you think world revamp in 11.0 or 12.0
[4:14:44] mavericks312: Also if you change the timeline you have 2 versions of retail
[4:14:45] stjon13: Part of reason ppl want classic plus is the class identity the weaving of swing timers etc not Cata era
[4:14:46] koko316: It would be nice to see them step up with the free game play like FFXIV has
[4:15:11] FlameStryke: @mavericks312 why not retail did it to classic lol

[4:23:50] belfastcl: the streamers purchasing gold narrative was just staysafe trying to smear payo
[4:23:50] toobaked1987: No Mak'gora in WoW has ever been fair. So that is how they ran it.
[4:23:51] Akurei87: Such a boring final tho, such a one-sided fight. Same with Ziqo vs Sonii
