[0:50:12] rudyjamesdio: You’re not a bad person for that, you’re human for getting mad at someone wrongly attacking you, but I think it shows that you choose to remain comfortable and won’t consider that life can be extremely hard for others who aren’t in your position @sodapoppin

And it's my job as his devout sub to spend every waking moment of my day reminding you of that. Pokemon cards? Nah. CyberPunk playthrough? Pfft, NO WAY!

In preschool I was known for telling the teacher when my classmates stuck their tongue out at me and as I got older I would go to the principles office whenever I heard somebody say a cuss word. I was always described as uptight, insecure and lacking any kind of sense of humor or self awareness.

Its annoying seeing dmca frogs spamming their shit. Its been 2 weeks since nintendo started it on youtube, and anyone with half a brain knows that nintendo only does it for the money. You have to be a ludwig viewer to not realize that is the reason they do it.
