[1:49:48] bl1nk_1298: @MixedBiscuit its all of the best and worst players from both retail and vanilla, pretty rough combo lol
[1:49:51] crematedBrain: @Guzu Speaking from experience, there's a lot of new people in BFD runs lately. Be patient.
[1:49:52] I_Am_Fletch: om
[1:49:53] kri_kurilala: im pretty sure you can't soloheal the entire raid even if you're lvl 34
[1:49:56] sondena: when people hit boss while totem is up healing is hard...
[1:49:58] mediana91: need a priest?
[1:49:59] Yvernaa: You might have to replace the Druid, Parsche would love to help
[1:49:59] monkaToSser: semi heal

Hey Chat, Wasn't this old Content, isn't this on farm Status already? Guzu, Who did you invite again, have you found the professional griefers again?

[1:50:50] TheButton: ppl solo healed it at level 25

While grizzlies are immensely strong, gorillas, chimps, and monkeys have much greater muscle strength than other animals of a similar size. Cheer100 Cheer100 Cheer100

[3:09:41] ZjakalGames: Hi Guzu, it's Andy from middle school, the kid you bullied for 3 years. After I got transferred to another school I had huge self-esteem issues and never made any friends. I turned to world of warcraft, the only game that made me feel special, but when I found out you're the top wow streamer I got flashbacks from when you bullied me. There is no justice in this world. I am going to end my life in hardcore now I hope you are happy.. Cheer100 Cheer100 Cheer100
