[2:20:30] Knoives: ratJAM
[2:20:36] noships: wtf is mouse over step?
[2:20:37] valtidude98: nah
[2:20:47] noships: you don't need any
[2:20:49] noships: nah
[2:20:49] valtidude98: if u are doing 2s
[2:20:51] valtidude98: then do
[2:20:55] mtbzt: mouseovers are usually wonky, unless its to insta kill a totem or something like that
[2:20:59] dankNstein_: you need more clear indicators for diminishing returns imo. you should get diminish and set it to nameplates
[2:20:59] SPENCERGUH: ill nasty song
[2:21:04] valtidude98: shadowstep on party 1
[2:21:07] jornari: if you use tharmacro it only uses mouseover if u hover otherwise it uses it like normal spell
[2:21:21] jornari: if 123 macros are not yours, that's one option some ppl
[2:21:23] jornari: use
[2:21:23] IcyNovaz: yo jake what up man
[2:21:38] noships: the spam sap macro
[2:21:43] pewtanblot: Joe mama? PogChamp
[2:21:49] valtidude98: do u know about the sap closest target macro? its insane for rogue mirror matches
[2:21:54] dankNstein_: i personally dislike gladius i use sArena, xaryu even has a pre-set made for him in that addon that someone made
[2:21:55] IcyNovaz: was that actually you in the arena the other day? lol
[2:21:55] noships: oh and change your duel bind
[2:21:56] jornari: overall mouseovers alone are bad because you can fuck up shit by accident
[2:22:08] sneakysnakx: @pewtanblot is that myth
[2:22:13] visalsk: jake pogchamp emote when Kapp
[2:22:15] noships: you were fucking up duel fatfingering, you said you wanted to change it
[2:22:18] pewtanblot: Yeah @snaksxx
[2:22:20] kegness: target aqquired warlock
[2:22:31] valtidude98: u also need focus arena macro
[2:22:38] CallMeInfinity: pepeJAM
[2:23:00] valtidude98: /focus arena1, arena 2, arena 3. It makes it so u dont have to click on gladius to focus targets
[2:23:02] valtidude98: u can just keybind it
[2:23:24] IcyNovaz: I vs a rogue and I messaged him asking if it was you lol
[2:23:26] Hiddenchican0: Hiddenchican0 subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 23 months, currently on a 18 month streak! Soapland resub POGGERS LLLLLLLLLLLLL
[2:23:26] StreamElements: Hiddenchican0 just subscribed for 23 months in a row PogChamp
[2:23:28] SPENCERGUH: scrollwheel is good bind for focus arena 123
[2:23:35] sneakysnakx: jnbYo jnbYo jnbYo jnbYo jnbYo
[2:23:50] noships: you don't even need focus macros if you use the modifier Jake
[2:23:51] jornari: fitting all focus 123 and target 123 hard if no naga yikes
[2:23:52] crusade03: just get a mouse with like 50 side buttons lol
[2:24:05] noships: yepyep
[2:24:10] jornari: mousewheel is good also for targeting
[2:24:12] benoTTV: you don't need all those macros and shit to be good
[2:24:13] valtidude98: Thats not the same thing
[2:24:22] jornari: upwheel target 1 downwheel target 2
[2:24:27] jornari: or sumthing
[2:24:31] noships: LULW
[2:24:35] noships: make it easier then
[2:24:37] sneakysnakx: @crussade1 hes got the best mouse in the game the shroud mouse #ad
[2:24:50] IcyNovaz: what class is giving you the hardest time in arenas?
[2:25:14] valtidude98: I assume you are right clicking gladius when focusing a target. A keybind to focus an arena target makes it easier if you and your team switches the kill target mid-match and you need the old kill target to be your focus target
[2:25:17] noships: alt-shift is going to mess with your keyboard language too btw
[2:25:22] Mindhysteria: not near the mob with shadowstrike LULW
[2:25:26] noships: idk if you have multiple
[2:25:41] jornari: stickykeys enabled lets goo
[2:26:00] scrubbzer0: dosnt work if you have alt binding already
[2:26:14] joeesbeast: use pikaboo macros bro
[2:26:28] noships: no that doesn't make any sense
[2:26:50] valtidude98: Oh, ALSO! You need a cancelaura for your blade dance! @jakenbakeLIVE
[2:27:02] valtidude98: (its a macro)
[2:27:05] noships: try in city with target dummies
[2:27:11] jornari: just make a macro for it [target=focus,harm,exists]
[2:27:35] noships: Jake go to a city and do this on target dummies
[2:27:49] HiiHyper: hi chat peepoShy
[2:28:03] jornari: why am i even writing, got lower rating than jake LUL
[2:28:11] noships: change your duel keybind too, you said you wanted to change it @jakenbakeLIVE
[2:28:16] noships: you fat fingered it a bunch
[2:28:23] HiiHyper: chat wont say hi but at least jake will Sadge
[2:28:34] buutfuuk: @valtidude98 blade dance?
[2:28:45] itzabappo: Ohayooooo
[2:28:47] valtidude98: If you are in shadow dance, you cant enter steatlh. So /cancelaura shadow dance will remove it so u can re-stealth, instead of having to right click the icon to remove it @jakenbakeLIVE
[2:28:53] valtidude98: @onlyhere4justchatting i meant shadow dance ops xD
[2:28:54] GunIess2k: HeyGuys hi jack
[2:28:57] noships: try rupture
[2:29:09] Mindhysteria: cant kidney that mob is what its saying
[2:29:20] noships: no, he just tried rupture @MindHyst3ria
[2:29:22] noearthtones: what's your focus modifier
[2:29:25] noearthtones: alt?
[2:29:27] valtidude98: u cant stun mechanical creatures, jake
[2:29:29] Mindhysteria: o then that keybind is messed up
[2:29:31] noships: LULW
[2:29:34] Mindhysteria: i have that bound and dont use it
[2:29:34] scrubbzer0: lol
[2:29:39] noships: there it is
[2:29:44] valtidude98: oh nice :D
[2:29:50] joeesbeast: there it is dood
[2:29:53] noearthtones: wait what was the problem?
[2:29:57] Mindhysteria: 5Head
[2:30:04] buutfuuk: bc alt is default self cast
[2:30:05] noearthtones: oh
[2:30:06] noships: this is how reckful did it btw FeelsStrongMan @jakenbakeLIVE
[2:30:11] 999_matt: this is weird question but any of u know how to say there is no mountains in my town in Japanese lol

[2:32:29] noships: it's not a panda tho
[2:32:58] SPENCERGUH: thats the sap stealth macro
[2:33:00] Einherjan_: jnbSubs
[2:33:00] SPENCERGUH: its good
[2:33:02] valtidude98: It saps the closest target to u
[2:33:04] FeelsAndrewMan: is it a good time to get into WoW
[2:33:21] Einherjan_: @fruityy_inc no better time
[2:33:36] SirConky: @fruityy_inc very good time
[2:33:47] pewtanblot: @JackDeCarlo @nicklewis13 jnbHey
[2:33:51] FeelsAndrewMan: @jackdecarlo oh cool thanks
[2:33:54] dium: you can do the ? icon
[2:33:58] SPENCERGUH: the #showtooltip will make the icon sap
[2:33:58] Einherjan_: @pewtanblot Hola
[2:33:59] dium: showtooltip will show it anyway
[2:34:02] noships: oh, if you wanna be really technical, you could macro in a /stopattack onto your mount keybind so you can spam that and make sure you're not swinging into something keeping you in combat unnecessarily longer
[2:34:10] noships: that's how I did
[2:34:13] FeelsAndrewMan: @sirconky thanks i want to play it so bad but i dont know much about the game
[2:34:18] Knoives: dont forget to add blood fury
[2:34:30] SPENCERGUH: closest player not npcs
[2:34:33] valtidude98: no it should
[2:34:35] valtidude98: oh
[2:34:41] valtidude98: its only for players
[2:34:42] valtidude98: not NPCs
[2:34:45] Einherjan_: @fruityy_inc This expansion is a big improvement over BFA. Fairly easy to pickup and they now have a tutorial starting area.
[2:35:13] Einherjan_: @fruityy_inc Called Exile's Reach, I think. I haven't played a low level in awhile.
[2:35:20] FeelsAndrewMan: @jackdecarlo oh cool thank you so much
[2:36:09] valtidude98: i would recommend getting a macro for removing shadow dance too @jakenbakeLIVE

[2:36:46] SPENCERGUH: join the furries :)
[2:37:02] Einherjan_: Night Tae zone was pretty neat, though.

[2:41:05] dankNstein_: 10% dmg in opener
[2:41:12] Einherjan_: @fruityy_inc Don't worry. It's not this complicated in the beginning

[2:41:52] dankNstein_: burrs is trash
[2:41:56] dankNstein_: they have to run into it
[2:42:20] dankNstein_: its only good for pve
