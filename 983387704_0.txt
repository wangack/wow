[2:02:34] kutlus91: I'm kinda impressed by you bear tanking, didn't really see or at least remember seeing many, if any at all back in the day.
[2:03:38] Johan_cz: is a bear good tank in TBC? or i should just play warrior
[2:03:57] DocsMistake: @Johan_cz that really depends on what role you want, warrior is really good single target and progression because of its defensive CDs
[2:03:59] DecayedmiNt: Bear is second/tied with warrior end game
[2:04:07] Gunfluster: officer has a st heal, medic aoe h ea

[2:12:20] DecayedmiNt: Swipe and Lacerate tab targeting
[2:12:29] DecayedmiNt: Pally were AoE tank kings
[2:12:46] kutlus91: Yeah Pally>Druid>Warrior when it came to AoE tanking

[2:14:41] DecayedmiNt: Only thing you had to get used to as a Bear tank in BC was putting lacerate on everything
[2:16:27] rilsolo: from what i can tell with bears is you lacerate everything and mangle on cd pretty much
[2:16:47] DecayedmiNt: Basically, add in swipe every once and awhile

[4:09:33] qualtry: @Towelliee Im fine with boosting, I work 12 hours a day and have a family. Unforetunately I cant dedicate as much time as I would like to the game. unpopular opinion, but it really makes my life so much easier
[4:09:45] Spongeyguy: the only real bad thing about boosts is itll make the bot issue way way way worse
[4:10:29] luckfore: and to counter that they will add tokens @Spongeyguy
[4:10:45] c0gnusTV: blizzard just needs to fucking ban bots
[4:10:45] freexdk: just feels so bad that gear resets every patch
[4:11:14] Spongeyguy: i agree in vanilla but tbc they can boost druids with free flight form farming

[4:16:02] ventu105: hello
[4:16:29] Toosk1996: Trust me the botting issue is not to do with boosts that'll cost 60 dollars, i know someone who botted x2 chars on the same account to rank 14, blizzards stance towards botting is the issue, not the boosts

[4:23:58] ToxicxEternity: this rotation xD
[4:23:58] bruhSit_farmer: ofc they will
[4:24:03] Roch9: for some reason Im enjoying classic way more than retail atm :D leveling new chars been amazing tbh
[4:24:04] bruhSit_farmer: still be more fun than sl though
[4:24:06] Sh4nti: Nah attunements take a month I think

[4:24:49] TomTwoCats: hi
[4:25:10] mrblond5: If they are pre nerf no way they kill them
[4:25:48] AelyzZ: dude pre nerf is still easy
[4:26:00] itz_soda24: How often can u raid on one character in tbc?
[4:26:01] bruhSit_farmer: i hope 9.1 makes the world and zones come alive with actual meaningful grinds, game feels so instanced atm
[4:26:06] Sh4nti: None of the private server players have done pre-nerf bosses so it won't be a walkover
[4:26:16] mrblond5: Yep
[4:26:51] AelyzZ: yeah but he said it will take months
[4:26:58] 3663Sharad: Booty Bay Booties :D
[4:27:06] AelyzZ: for mw it will take months yes
[4:27:23] Aphro_Samurai: why do people care what the 1% of tbc players are going to do? play tbc with you buds and have a blast.
[4:27:34] Gandimir: tbc difficulty is a time issue not a skill issue for most ppl. even prenerf the bosses and atunement themself aint hard
[4:27:39] mrblond5: I don't see how can someone kill pre nerf  Kael'thas
[4:27:49] TomTwoCats: I love that TBC will be again online, I only regret that Bliz havent updated graphics
[4:27:59] bruhSit_farmer: we still thinking tbc before 9.1 towell ??
[4:28:23] Sh4nti: BC will have new graphics toggle
[4:28:35] bruhSit_farmer: no it wont ^ same as retail shanti
[4:28:39] bruhSit_farmer: same options

[4:33:37] sprert: also epic flying is not needed
[4:33:56] flappyurf: i was a latecomer to BC slowly progressing ,still made it to epic flying before BT i think :D

[5:19:42] mrblond5: like i  said they better have the witcher 3 level story to keep me leveling for that long
[5:19:49] fqx96: If the leveling is good and contributes to end game, then that'd be alright though
[5:19:55] RuinTV: I would love to run another campaign with you, real talk most fun I have had in GW2 and SWTOR with you.
[5:20:03] Kuroii_Ck: Riot MMO will outshine the rest cause ghostcrawler is running it

[5:23:51] Noshpan: @hookkz Pretty much. WoW is just a better EverQuest

[5:26:46] moggy1988: @zechetto yes but they are building a base story with the table top games and making lore that could transfer into a mmo in years to come.
[5:26:47] Kuroii_Ck: like steampunk area as an MMO area? plus ionia like MoP land? plus the land of nox acting like a toxic green area ? the world is immense and seems to be cool for league MMO
[5:26:51] Mograim: ty @plague_seraph

[5:27:06] Necrosack: metzens new pencil and paper rpg is called Auroboros, based on his high school D&D game.  looks interesting

[6:06:15] Medobolt: 2400, not glad
[6:06:15] Fidgew: They could, just copy paste the pvp system. Slap bang, easy
[6:06:16] Plague_GG: 226 +15 , and 233 weapons/trinkets +20 imo
[6:06:18] StraightErro: there is a macro command to view your vault anywhere as a hotkey
[6:06:36] Kuroii_Ck: if they made 226 you have to finish all 20s that would be really restrictive
[6:06:43] solstarz: solstarz subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 36 months! Morning :))
[6:06:52] NoshyNosh: Dont need that macro anymore, just click "Mythic Dungeons" in your hotkey "i" and you can open it :P @Towelliee

[7:14:45] Masqerader: unless they're getting vaccinated like crazy

[7:16:24] MetallicusGaming: Keep in mind there's a HUGE difference between a simple office and a LARGE Game company
[7:16:38] oreo_mintx: the only reason productivity increased by working from home is becuase people work more hours.

[7:17:09] rekninehc: Im way more productive working from home, as an IT consultant. But I guess its not for everyone.
[7:17:10] izabeL: I'm actually more efficient WFH, i don't have a million people coming in my office asking dumb questions
[7:17:13] Vorrain: i gained 3 hours of commute time back by working from home - aint no way im doing work in that time
[7:17:14] pzumja: do you think theres a chance that they would split the patch up? like launch raid and pvp season, and the rest later?

[7:45:08] Snacktooth: alpha next spring then
[7:45:50] grokshar: it's so sad that in WoW nowadays you buy the xpac and you don't know if you get the patches
[7:45:59] Masqerader: They could have a Blizzcon with vaccine passports or some shit
[7:46:02] PotbellyGoat: I wonder if 10.0 will bring a new class or not
[7:46:04] Holgrim93: Thats seems insane to me
[7:46:15] Boofz: same shift happened for FFXIV's next exp
[7:46:21] ArcaneSyntax: what if we get a 9.3 but its smaller? like 5-6 boss tier, but it only lasts like 6-7 months before 10.0
[7:46:23] casualfury: @grokshar y it looks like a patreon game at this point
[7:46:30] grokshar: yea :(
[7:46:43] Sollice: @Potbelly_Goat I dont think it will. I think they just wont have enough time to get that fleshed out

[7:47:55] lithium364: i really dont want them to put 80% of the wow staff to work on the next expansion already like in wod
[7:48:10] DeleldurTV: Why is everyone overlooking the possibility of shadowlands being the first expac to last 3 years?
[7:48:21] Mr_Abeon: 9.3 could be a timeless isle 2.0
[7:48:22] Armdel: 3 boss raid with nothing but reused assets
[7:48:23] enux337: those trinkets were fire
[7:48:26] Thoreya: We’ll prob get like a 9.2.5 and that’s it

[7:50:02] Moobot: Check out Towelliee's latest Youtube video! https://youtu.be/U8-64zqVa8k Shadowlands needs some help

[7:50:33] PvtHudson093: if 9.1 is a shortened patch then knock it down from 10 to 8 bosses in the raid
[7:50:45] Broomba: 9.1/9.2 behind at least 3-4 months
[7:51:10] Thoreya: They ducking Better make 10.0 a big expansion
[7:51:12] enux337: 6 months
[7:51:14] torvoltas: a freaking year
[7:51:16] Thoreya: I swear man
[7:51:22] luckfore: 9.2 will be last patch and it will be 9-10 months then till 10.0
[7:52:05] theszoti: we're probably not getting 9.3
[7:52:06] PadidinJones: Maybe we are only getting a drought now instead
[7:52:21] deckardblade: you are assuming thye dont delay 10.0 thought, which might happen
[7:52:59] Vorrain: or you sacrifice a piece to get to the overall deadling
[7:53:03] Vorrain: *deadline
[7:53:07] lithium364: bobby will not allow it
[7:53:12] Boofz: It's not just wow.... FFXIV is behind in their cycle as well and their next exp is delayed too.
[7:53:13] grokshar: bobby needs the cash
[7:53:16] casualfury: no they are too greedy for that
[7:53:17] RocketMan23: at the end of hte day its all speculation until we know some details so no sense getting worried about what could be
[7:53:49] PadidinJones: Its just annoying because we can only speculate what they might do and we get no certainty from Blizzard that there will be a patch by a certain time
[7:53:50] MetallicusGaming: Later Towelliee
[7:53:53] luckfore: peace
[7:53:54] Armdel: activision won't let them postpone the new release
