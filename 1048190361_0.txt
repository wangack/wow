Not to mention also I've got the balance improved thorns speced increase damage by 75%. That shit will fucking pump. Good luck out-dpsing my buff. It's a godsend.

[8:54:39] NejyCR: The Alabama beach mouse, an endangered species, lives in coastal dune ecosystems. It’s a small mouse with a buff colored patch on its back and snowy white underbelly. Strictly nocturnal in nature, they have large eyes and big ears to help them as they leave their burrows at dusk and remain active during the night. They are much less active on moonlit nights though to avoid becoming a late night snack for predators

[13:15:19] Andriukiukas1: 4Head
[13:15:19] AlphaGM: Taunt does two things. It makes your threat equal to the person at top of threat table and also has a short debuff on the target that makes it impossible for them to switch
[13:15:25] raph__999: Kappa
[13:15:25] timmon_: so you are #1 thread again,
[13:15:25] spezz: you need 110% of threat that the current aggro holder has when you are in melee, and 130% when in range to take aggro

[13:59:59] Reticent_88: @VHmanu The damage of Lacerate doesn't have a high threat modifier. The threat comes from just applying the debuff initially.
