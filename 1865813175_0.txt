[2:20:06] pahnage: goblin sapper does like 750 damage
[2:20:08] Aruze2014: The warrior intercepted the hunter, he did Bloodthirst,Mortal strike Rage potion into a Sapper charge i thin and then he executed
[2:20:28] Galvengar: It's gonna be a close one... I think both have some good stuff going for them... I am gonna go with Tactics for the W. That said I would not be surprised if Payo ends up taking the W. They are both CRAZY good.

[2:22:04] Aruze2014: He does have alot ot buffs
[2:22:15] Aruze2014: my money is on the warrior cuz Warrior counters Rogue every time
[2:22:40] Legend102t: I am voting on warrior also, but im not counting payo out 100%
[2:22:53] Aruze2014: maybe the Hutner dodged and the warrior overpowered maybe
[2:23:06] Aruze2014: i like payo but Warrior > Rogue :3
[2:23:10] Galvengar: I am with you on that one, Legend.
[2:23:17] pahnage: you going to prep for next tournament (if there is one)?
[2:23:37] ZenoahTV: how do i send a DM to Swifty
[2:23:41] cosmosika: warrior cant win this tournament :/
[2:24:17] Trickfinger01: a lucky crit may decide it
[2:24:18] pahnage: second place is $1000 off from first place
[2:24:41] PaEu: They really should make PvP servers with lower level cap. could be so fun
[2:24:51] Rastafaris: i think warrior only can keep up with rogue if u only charge eitehr than that warrior will get outsped
[2:25:04] Galvengar: 10/10 reasoning!
[2:25:10] Galvengar: Age is just a number
[2:25:26] SSD511_: Getting old LUL

[2:36:38] Aruze2014: Insane Warrior Tricks man ! <3
[2:36:41] OGSceneBoy: Payo is so salty lmaoo
[2:36:48] bitlexx: @stitchinxs thats not the issue. it got payo out of stealth
[2:36:51] pahnage: he probably heard it he has wireless headphones
[2:37:08] Trickfinger01: 10 seconds of immunity against a rogue is useless

[2:38:35] koltgaming45: I still remember 15 years ago in classic wow.  Practicing our swifty macros to get ready. @Swifty
[2:38:38] OGSceneBoy: People already saying the pet was cheesing
[2:38:39] timmyslapper123: swifty would have won that tournament
[2:38:41] OGSceneBoy: LUL
[2:38:42] JattixTV: Man its only ever rouge players who have a fit like that over getting countered
[2:39:33] MartianPK: swifty what was ur reaction to payo goin crazy LUL
[2:39:43] PawkyTV: would have loved to see you get in on the tournament Swifty
[2:39:45] OGSceneBoy: @JattixTV As a rogue player myself, I agree
[2:39:58] Malkir1: 58 pet is wack
[2:40:04] GrayZeny: No stealth is really tough for rogue
[2:40:13] Malkir1: payo would have won if no pet lets be fair
[2:40:21] JattixTV: @gorepuddle Ya I have seen thief players in GW2 go crazier over getting countered
[2:40:24] dentalbond: @swifty tactics can never step up to Swifty's warrior
[2:40:26] MartianPK: ya that high level pet ruins his rogue opener
[2:40:36] MattOriginal: that 58 pet made the tournament so anti-climatic
[2:40:46] Malkir1: everyone knew tactics would win because ecveryone knew he had the pet
[2:40:49] ozzymagnum: i think payo would have won if the pet didnt exist
[2:40:56] JattixTV: 1 time use
[2:40:58] StreamElements: Viewers and Subscribers generate points! You can redeem them at store for on screen effects! https://streamelements.com/swifty/store
[2:40:59] Malkir1: he had 3 uses @Swifty  they all knew he had it
[2:40:59] MartianPK: 3 charges, cinder bracers or something
[2:41:10] CaptainGrodan: It was very fun
[2:41:13] GrayZeny: Its from the fire festival which is only up once per year
[2:41:24] de4ko: notwith your fingers :)
[2:41:26] Trickfinger01: isn't it really dangerous to get though?
[2:41:27] Malkir1: he only used one
[2:41:28] JattixTV: yup
[2:41:37] PawkyTV: warrior followed the rules and won.. best player of the day
[2:41:39] Malkir1: but everyone knew he could pull it out at anytime
[2:41:43] Sittinbacknzone: ***
[2:41:47] Fight_Monkey: he came prepared
[2:41:54] ZenoahTV: @Swifty are you there, is there a way of DM'ing you?
[2:41:54] Malkir1: rogue still best
[2:42:05] stitchinxs: he used firer fire before pet lol
[2:42:09] ozzymagnum: which class do you think is hardest to play in hc and the easiest one?
[2:42:15] Aruze2014: i just re-watched the fight, yeah the pet did like over 50% of the damage, payo only lost because of that pet lol
[2:42:21] Malkir1: no they even said pet found payo @17200dio
[2:42:35] Trickfinger01: no the pet did drag him out, then he faryfired right?
[2:42:45] Malkir1: pet saw him a mile away
[2:42:49] Aruze2014: its called "Cinder Elemental"
[2:42:56] 7thSaga: i think payo still woulda lost wit out the pet Kappa
[2:42:56] OGSceneBoy: Yeah alot of people are saying that right now, the pet got Tactics the win
[2:43:01] Fight_Monkey: the rules said anything goes... so, ya know
[2:43:06] Malkir1: it was in the rules, its just lame to win like that but 1500 bucks is 1500 bucks
[2:43:11] Trickfinger01: tactics put in the time and he won
[2:43:15] Sdeleon159: I mean it was anything goes right?
[2:43:27] terradreams: He had fairfire also @swifty
[2:43:30] ironmouse34: i think with Payo getting buffs and respeccing in-between fights, it evened out
[2:43:33] Aruze2014: its a A reward from a midsummer event quest held in July
[2:43:35] treakc: Payo could have gotten the pet aswell, but he didnt
[2:43:37] Aruze2014: The Fire Festival
[2:43:39] Pesticide: if peyo knew, he woulda used it too
[2:43:50] filagaming156: It was okay if he could use it and get it
[2:44:17] Grael1256: could have payo used the same pet?
[2:44:19] terradreams: @swifty he had fairfire
[2:44:21] PawkyTV: ot
[2:44:22] Malkir1: payo didnt want to
[2:44:27] jensenpassingby: Is it crazy how saying sentences backwards creates backwards sentences saying how crazy it is?
[2:44:29] OGSceneBoy: Yeah I wanted Tactics to win just because it would be cool to see a warrior win but feel bad for payo
[2:44:29] Malkir1: he spent time farming and getting stronger himself
[2:44:32] terradreams: The warrior
[2:44:33] QUICKNSS: but they said use what ever you can lol
[2:44:45] t0mars: The pet took Payo out of stealth
[2:44:53] Malkir1: mage sapper charged that druid
[2:44:56] Malkir1: and 1 shot him XD
[2:44:57] Arkitek: yea for this one, if they allow it.. it is what is
[2:45:08] PawkyTV: how is it dirty if it's within the rules?
[2:45:09] filagaming156: Payo had helpers that's not fair also
[2:45:18] Fight_Monkey: theres plenty of tournaments with all that stuff banned, where the rogue would have won just for being a rogue. This is what happens in an "anything goes" tournament though
[2:45:23] Malkir1: tactics had helpers and got WW axe what? @filagaming156
[2:45:25] terradreams: The warrior said fairfire took him out of stealth but idk about that I think pet did @swifty
[2:45:33] OGSceneBoy: Hell naw
[2:45:33] Malkir1: i wouldnt duel them
[2:45:40] 7thSaga: yes becaus eit would be funny LUL
[2:45:40] Arkitek: if the rules allow it
[2:45:46] Fujichirou: it can still be lame even if it's in the rules
[2:45:55] PawkyTV: regardless of winner.. it was fun to watch
[2:45:56] Malkir1: rogue can beat a warr with WW axe at 30
[2:46:19] Malkir1: tactics had WW axe also @Swifty
[2:46:24] Malkir1: but with a 58 pet thats bs
[2:46:26] rolius88: come back a undead wand user! i will hook u up with bags and a wand!
[2:46:35] Malkir1: ya thats my point @Swifty
[2:46:41] Malkir1: he would have won EVEN against ww axe
[2:46:45] Aruze2014: Tbh the way the warrior played , he kind of played it Badly, payo was doing alot of stuff, the Warrior popped Retal, and payo was stunlocking the warrior down but the pet was doing over 75% of the damage
[2:47:01] Aruze2014: The warrior was in Defensive stance the entire time, and he used Disarm but payo was immune
[2:47:10] Aruze2014: he just stood there and let the pet do all the work
[2:47:16] Malkir1: yah pet won tourney give the pet the check :)
[2:47:21] Arkitek: the caster said the pet did 10-12 dmg per hit so they allowed it
[2:47:30] Arkitek: dunno if thats true lol
[2:47:44] Malkir1: 10-12 dmg MORE than reaper @Arkitek so even more than jsut 10-12
[2:47:46] Fight_Monkey: i like the dirty tricks. The fiar tournaments are always just decided by matchups, kind of boring
[2:47:46] 7thSaga: rogues op so it was a even match Kappa
[2:47:55] Aruze2014: no the pet was doing 75-140 dmg per hit
[2:47:58] StreamElements: Redeem Points at point store https://streamelements.com/swifty/store
[2:48:01] Malkir1: pet was also ranged
[2:48:02] rolius88: Come join the horde side! start up an Undead! And i will hook you up with bags and a wand! if u make a wanduser :D
[2:48:04] Malkir1: so was casting
[2:48:11] Arkitek: @Malkir1 oh was that it? musta misheard then
[2:48:13] Aruze2014: the pet was melee
[2:48:26] Malkir1: @Arkitek yah they just acted like it wasnt a lot when it is
[2:48:37] ZenoahTV: are you there @Swifty can u send me a DM pls
[2:48:38] Fight_Monkey: Why is the rogue supposed to get the opener? Fake news FamilyMan
[2:48:46] Malkir1: pet had ranged spells
[2:48:50] Malkir1: was casting ireball
[2:49:21] Fight_Monkey: Gimmicks lol
[2:49:42] xxf3v3rxx: lvl 58 pets
[2:49:45] thorrfury: swifty you going rog nooooo
[2:49:51] Aruze2014: The warrior used some sort of Powder to keep payo from going invisible, he used Thunderclap , and Disarm , payo avoided all of the warriors retaliation and the warrior only landed 1 or 2 auto/overpower crits for deep wounds
[2:50:06] Aruze2014: He threw a bomb for 500 fire dmg
[2:50:15] Malkir1: yah payo would have won
[2:50:17] OGSceneBoy: i think you are right Swifty, just because something follows rules doesnt mean its good Sportmanship
[2:50:17] PawkyTV: if it was a level 40 tournament would rogues have been as good?
[2:50:19] Malkir1: EZ
[2:50:28] StreamElements: Type !points to see how many points you have!
[2:50:34] Aruze2014: The pet did the rest, 65-140 dmg
[2:50:38] Aruze2014: per hit
[2:50:54] Malkir1: just blame the people for saying pet was allowed
[2:50:54] Fight_Monkey: the gimmicks make it fun, who wants to see all rogue finals
[2:50:56] Malkir1: dont blame tactics
[2:50:58] StreamElements: Viewers and Subscribers generate points! You can redeem them at store for on screen effects! https://streamelements.com/swifty/store
[2:51:04] Aruze2014: im kind of disgusted by the fact he didnt give him a fair fighrt
[2:51:25] Malkir1: i can appreciatre payos anger and respect him for lashing out on stream
[2:51:28] 7thSaga: think he always gets mad when he lsoes at something LUL
[2:51:29] Clothsack: thats what money does, lmao
[2:51:35] OGSceneBoy: Yep wasnt fair at all
[2:51:38] OGSceneBoy: Lol
[2:51:54] Galdrena: @ZenoahTV can you check your twitch whispers please?
[2:52:04] Fight_Monkey: fair just = rogue winning 100% of the time
[2:52:05] Aruze2014: i didnt realize Warriors had Backstab as an ability :D guess i was wrong Kappa
[2:52:14] twistedspinach: what was the prze
[2:52:15] tbcisdead1234: But Asmongold is right the Thing to Safe WoW is resett WoW completly the Tournament had more Viewer then Blizzard Tournament and all WoW Streamers together
[2:52:15] movit1: he should have let Payo win
[2:52:32] Aruze2014: id say Rematch
[2:52:35] Malkir1: 1500 @twistedspinach from what i heard
[2:52:44] Jaseventura: payo should of waited 10 mins for the pet to dissapear :D
[2:52:52] twistedspinach: nice!
[2:52:55] Malkir1: heh ad 2 more casts @Jaseventura
[2:52:56] OGSceneBoy: A level 58 pet vs a level 30 rogue is def not fair
[2:53:01] Clothsack: A good friend would split the money
[2:53:04] movit1: yes lol
[2:53:17] Malkir1: pet saw him in stealth a mile away
[2:53:21] jembah3: swoofty
[2:53:22] Aruze2014: i just dinged 50 on my orc Hardcore warrior :3
[2:53:27] Aruze2014: i love warriors
[2:53:27] Malkir1: go rogue its more fun for hardcore @Swifty warr you have to do too many hoops lvling
[2:53:31] Aruze2014: i dont play anything else
[2:53:31] ozzymagnum: which class do you like the most to lvl up with?
[2:53:48] Fight_Monkey: if the matchup is inherently unfair, then Tactics is just playing to win FamilyMan
[2:53:57] Aruze2014: Actualy on a Pserver but thats not important
[2:54:07] rolius88: SWIFTY! JOIN THE DARK SIDE! FOR THE HORDE!!!
[2:54:07] Malkir1: its a makgora dont blame tactics
[2:54:10] Malkir1: blame the rtules
[2:54:23] Fight_Monkey: people talking about fairness, but Warrior vs Rogue is not exactly fair to begin with
[2:54:35] OGSceneBoy: Its not even about the rules, just poor sportsmanship
[2:54:39] Aruze2014: Tbh i only play what i know how to play :3 at least i get better
[2:54:41] Malkir1: swifty war wouldnt losed to a rogue come on @Night_Cleaner
[2:54:53] Navvi3: there is a macro for spamming wand so it wont turn off
[2:55:17] t0mars: you need to use macro otherwise it turns off
[2:55:17] Malkir1: i think its going to go to 45, but maybe 60 ?

[3:14:58] 7thSaga: i hope thay wont pull a Blizz and make changes
[3:15:21] SGTNedzillaYT: Ye they banned it after the tourny
[3:16:06] 7thSaga: how bout Lets just give them a Rematch Kappa
[3:16:06] screamypants: all is fair in love and war
[3:16:13] Aruze2014: its like using Steroids at the Olimpics if everyone does it does that make it fair?
[3:16:18] MyOpiate: if lvl cap is 30, there shouldn't be any pets above 30... that's just common sense
[3:16:18] SGTNedzillaYT: Not fair no but too late after realising he was right to be angry
[3:16:26] Shaxew: bcs life is all about fair play
[3:16:26] TacticalFuzz: How do ytou even get a high level pet at level 30? :o
[3:16:41] OGSceneBoy: Yeah Payo was so salty because he is pretty passionate about the game
[3:16:43] 1986deliyuerek1986: hey my boy how you doing
[3:16:49] SGTNedzillaYT: The candles
[3:17:29] ironmouse34: there's an argument for both sides - Tactics shouldn't have used the pet and Payo shouldn't have been getting summoned all over the world for buffs and respecs inbetwen fights
[3:17:59] StreamElements: Redeem Points at point store https://streamelements.com/swifty/store
[3:18:54] ironmouse34: it is what it is tho ... it was still a fun tourny to watch once they got it going
[3:19:02] srybe: what dueling tournament are you watching?
[3:19:08] Banye23: Was payo a retail PvPer before?
[3:19:14] MyOpiate: buffs are different than a 28 lvl different pet.  =/=
[3:19:30] Aruze2014: tbh if ur in a Tournament and u have 5-10 minutes between matches noboddy cares if u run a marathon and go to mc donalds for ur foodbuffs before ur next match as long as ur there on time.
[3:19:36] ironmouse34: they were talking about that pet before the tourny even started
[3:19:42] OGSceneBoy: Yeah the pet was level 58 LUl
[3:19:53] Aruze2014: Tactics also had tons of buffs i bet he also had massive backing
[3:20:00] twistedspinach: yo swifty have you seen the new blackstone brickoven pizza makers?
[3:20:11] SGTNedzillaYT: He’ll be back at the next one even tho he said he won’t coz he can’t anymore you’ll see 🤣
[3:20:25] bepsisthebeast: i still think the warrior cheated by summoning rag
[3:20:28] twistedspinach: no you can use it in your backyard
[3:20:29] StreamElements: Type !points to see how many points you have!
[3:20:36] ocean_sunshine: payo got the restealth anyway so
[3:20:47] Aruze2014: TBH The pet pulled payo out of stealth but the warrior didnt even monopolize on it, he just stood in a tower and used Retal, got stunlocked and tried to jump away while the pet did all the damage lol
[3:20:59] StreamElements: Viewers and Subscribers generate points! You can redeem them at store for on screen effects! https://streamelements.com/swifty/store
[3:21:07] Aruze2014: a Real warrior would have used Shield Wall
[3:21:08] OGSceneBoy: That pet hit payo sdo hard lol
[3:21:13] ironmouse34: @Aruze2014 except that if you miss your next match then you get DQ'd ...which is what they started doing, but they delayed for the championship to allow Payo time to get back
[3:21:25] Clothsack: there goes a friendship over 1500buckos
[3:22:14] D3fyyy: gratz

[3:24:20] SGTNedzillaYT: Tactics said he had catseye elixir aswell btw
[3:24:30] OGSceneBoy: BIG counter, and if you rewatch the duel, the 58 pet did all the dmg
[3:24:37] CoeurDeLeon: pet doesn't have stealth detect, sees it because of level difference
[3:24:40] Aruze2014: the pet saw and attacked payo because he was lvl 30 yes
[3:24:47] ocean_sunshine: swifty you should make some big retrospective video or something man
[3:24:50] rolius88: the pet might would, but he needed to be closer i guess ?
[3:25:24] SGTNedzillaYT: Aye
[3:25:33] ironmouse34: Payo wins that without th epet and even if he didn't respec
[3:25:37] SGTNedzillaYT: Let’s him see stealth writhing 15yards
[3:25:51] dogdumps: i missed the duel tourney do u know who won?
[3:25:51] Stormhell1: ww axe ia a massive boost
[3:25:53] cosmosika: they had most help from others also. cant solo ww axe at that level etc
[3:26:00] OGSceneBoy: Yeah it is what it is at this point lol
[3:26:47] OGSceneBoy: WW axe at level 30 is a major flex
[3:27:01] Aruze2014: @Swifty  i know how to do the WW axe quest solo, u wana know how?
[3:27:08] Clothsack: without the pet he wouldve lost to payo
