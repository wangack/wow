[0:07:11] GreenArrowed: @saga_no how's it feeling now?
[0:07:24] saga_no: Still unsure of whether or not I like it - but as Ele it's OK as a multi-nature damage-slinger
[0:07:42] Ujai321: we have white noise on the audio connection

[0:08:29] saga_no: @GreenArrowed It's OK - I'm not fully used to how it works yet ... but I do a reasonable amount of damage and I don't die often
[0:08:34] DrezzTheGrimreaper666: yoyo
[0:08:35] Ujai321: do you remember how much the mic was?
[0:09:32] saga_no: Just passed the various trials (Frost, Fire, Shadow, etc) in Azshara ... good grief that was a *process*
[0:09:33] Leysfort: <3 Hazel
[0:09:51] Leysfort: is there melee hunter in hcsf?
[0:10:31] jeffdmk: the anniversary edition i always new you were big on being fancy
[0:10:32] Nnamu: when can you tame a croc
[0:10:35] Leysfort: oh I thought it was like SoD
[0:11:14] saga_no: I haven't done them before, so I don't know if it's a Shaman-specific quest or not
[0:11:25] Ujai321: 'Classic minus'... good thing you are not in Blizzard's PR department Kappa
[0:11:34] pebblesenn: my girlfriend formally requests a better view of the cat :)
[0:11:46] saga_no: Archmage Xylem's Trial ...or something

[0:12:28] pebblesenn: much appreciated
[0:13:06] TotallyNotRaien: concise scheduled mmo socializing only
[0:13:08] heldtheline: I like the idea that other people exist, I just don't want to deal with them (in WoW, but also in life).
[0:13:12] KenzieDuckMoo: i like the idea that other people exist around and in the world. I dont however like playing WITH them
[0:13:12] MortallyTransparentCupcke: Just don't die to the Alliance patrol
[0:13:24] Rantman_: hello canadian lady
[0:13:33] jeffdmk: hazel if you would get a mount twice as fast would you do mount runs with another person?
[0:13:43] zendavid: hello everyone
[0:14:02] Westtell401: the dragon flight dungeons were not bad
[0:14:03] GreenArrowed: i just can't believe they haven't released patch news yet
[0:14:07] Ujai321: so you are not coming back for S4, is what you are saying?
[0:14:14] GreenArrowed: no, that's how i socialize, too
[0:14:23] KenzieDuckMoo: Itd be cool if they made the SelfFound mode on Era without the Hardcore mode
[0:14:40] patn86: when comes season 4? :)
[0:14:41] thegreatdestroyer27607: slime kitty 2.0
[0:14:51] Westtell401: i actually legitimately Schedule social time i try to interact with people for at least two hours a day
[0:14:56] Thesabreclaw: I rock that same game sense... small, concise scheduled bits of M+/raid, and then "Appear Offline" and do my own thing the rest of the time. ;)
[0:14:59] patn86: ok ^^
[0:15:09] KenzieDuckMoo: well, HCSF already exists :P
[0:15:10] Ujai321: we do get an 8 hour downtime next reset, so who is to say
[0:15:17] Ujai321: could be .6, could not
[0:15:51] saga_no: Oof ... not feeling the greatest so Imma dive back into the game myself; stave off the waves of anxiety
[0:15:51] MortallyTransparentCupcke: is this not on era?
[0:15:57] Thesabreclaw: *** is saying 4 hours, now, for Tuesday
[0:16:28] Thesabreclaw: but even that is more than the usual 2 hours; so who knows... pirate banner unveil, next reset?
[0:16:30] eziekiyah: no news video this week Hazel?
[0:16:36] KenzieDuckMoo: Classic Era is Vanilla Classic (not Wrath/Cata Classic)
[0:16:49] Ujai321: oh right, it is saturday today
[0:17:16] Thesabreclaw: LOL!
[0:17:34] Westtell401: it could be surpise  10.2.6

[0:17:56] GreenArrowed: this cold/flu thing that's been going around everywhere has been rough
[0:18:10] wolfcloudchaser80: Yeah, some of those colds come and go, but leave scorched earth in their wake.
[0:18:15] Thesabreclaw: My friend's been battling a bad cold all week; you're not alone, Hazel. :(
[0:18:16] SenorTostada: Ooh so Im not the only one with a 2,5 week cold? Yaaay...?
[0:18:42] averageteacup: When i get cold i give up on everything, it's a holiday :D so hot drinks, watching youtube and playing games

[0:20:09] TotallyNotRaien: you have to be a specific type of gay to say yass and not cringe at yourself
[0:20:11] witchhobbit: slay is better
[0:20:20] Ujai321: would you be surprised if i told you i have not watched a single minute of Drag Race

[0:21:23] jeffdmk: hazel your stream slays
[0:21:33] Thesabreclaw: I noticed that change about a month ago; I thought I mentioned it here, but I guess it scrolled by too quick :-P
[0:22:27] n0haxi: if you ever get a parrot pet in wow please name it Ari in honor of my parrot haha
[0:22:53] Ujai321: are you a bird person?
[0:22:57] Thesabreclaw: Many of my alts still have Boralus as their hearth; access to the portals room is so quick from there.
[0:23:54] Ujai321: i'm not asking if you secretly have wings and feathers
[0:24:01] pebblesenn: have you gotten close to dying yet?
[0:24:06] pebblesenn: in the game not irl
[0:24:09] TotallyNotRaien: even tho she does
[0:24:11] Thesabreclaw: My one failing as a WoW player; haven't gotten set up to do pet battles, and all those pet dungeons.
[0:24:31] TotallyNotRaien: the pet dungeons are honestly really tiring
[0:25:23] grimlocc: hello hazel first time seeing your stream love your vids, so for retail seasson 4 what dungeons do u want to see and from what expan??
[0:25:26] jgbrit: Hi Hazel! Now Hazel, listen, I *have* to tell you about my last two BGs

[0:26:08] IAmScarlett__: hello my beloved streamer that i watch bc i enjoy her content
[0:26:58] Ujai321: "i didnt get hit in the face enough recently"
[0:27:11] celiajolie: Good morning Hazel!
[0:28:00] jeffdmk: yeah it is easy to get behind on it as a hunter because you rarely get punched
[0:28:02] jgbrit: Hazel, BG news incoming...
[0:28:15] Ujai321: oh, classic Good 5 Minutes of Crafting with Hazel (tm)
[0:28:19] jgbrit: Absolutely personal lol
[0:29:26] jeffdmk: so tell us already
[0:29:29] Ujai321: i do not understand how you live without seeing the empty slots in your bags. i could not do it, i always think the bags are completely full
[0:29:40] GreenArrowed: @jgbrit the absolute suspense here
[0:30:12] GustafTheSurvivor: Hello Hazel and chat! hazelWave anneCozy
[0:30:39] Ujai321: really, it would be much easier to just take the lizard tails and keep he lizards alive. the tail regrows
[0:30:41] ifrog86: @GustafTheSurvivor kelydrHi
[0:30:46] jgbrit: I played a sick quilboar game with the enchanted blood quest, I buffed the living daylights out of my triple Roogug. He was 650/650 and my triple piper triple one that gives +1 defense were giga buffed. I STILL came 2nd because of stupid rng
[0:31:09] wolfcloudchaser80: @Ujai321 I had the same reaction. I like the mod too much to drop it, but I feel like a graphical representation of open space (like green-yellow-red space indicator) would be nice.
[0:31:17] apheelia96: How much longer will you be streaming?
[0:31:20] Marmoh: The harpies here are what got me >.>
[0:31:21] heldtheline: That sounds like a WoW quest, 'The Amphibian Situation'.
[0:31:26] Windstalker_dev: We aren't announcing anything today...:) <--Holly Longdale :D
[0:31:35] Ujai321: really, you should just be careful your dog doesnt eat any lizards, period
[0:31:37] ahnn112: I leveled a zandalari troll monk just to not like it :(
[0:31:53] jgbrit: I played a sick quilboar game with the enchanted blood quest, I buffed the living daylights out of my triple Roogug. He was 650/650 and my triple piper triple one that gives +1 defense were giga buffed. I STILL came 2nd because of stupid rng
[0:32:07] jgbrit: However I won a sick game today
[0:32:08] wolfcloudchaser80: @Windstalker_dev Looking at your name.... are you that person in EQ that killed me so many times?
[0:32:21] GustafTheSurvivor: everytime i come to stream it's a talk about licking anneLol
[0:32:24] Ujai321: there isnt a quest in the game that i understand less than the last step of this one
[0:33:02] Windstalker_dev: Yes, lol. I'm also the exec producer of WoW now.  I love Hazel. Go Canadian sister!
[0:33:11] apheelia96: I gotta run to the store. Hopefully I get back in time to watch some more :)
[0:33:12] Daemavand: Greetings all! How is everyone? How is Hazel?
[0:33:40] Ujai321: that is the last step of that quest

[0:34:12] Daemavand: aaaaaaand get time to get hit my 2 min of ads :P
[0:34:26] jgbrit: Today I had a sick slyvanas game that i won. I had a triple Lava Lurker that I buffed the living daylights out of using nagas to perma buff it with tavern spells
[0:34:30] wolfcloudchaser80: Heh, yeah, this stream is the top of the shelf for chill WoW content
[0:34:46] Ujai321: for the low low cost of a FREE TWITCH PRIME SUB, you get no ads
[0:34:54] Ujai321: or, you know, ther eis Turbo
[0:35:08] Daemavand: I'm a hipster
[0:35:11] Daemavand: and dont have Prime :D
[0:35:14] Daemavand: but FINE
[0:35:39] Ujai321: i canceled my prime this month as well
[0:35:46] Ujai321: now i actually have to pay to sub here
[0:36:00] jgbrit: Today I had a sick slyvanas game that i won. I had a triple Lava Lurker that I buffed the living daylights out of using nagas to perma buff it with tavern spells
[0:36:20] Daemavand: Daemavand subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 21 months! 
[0:36:21] Streamlabs: daemavand just subscribed with Tier 1!
[0:36:56] TheBiggerBeard: nice sweater
[0:37:07] Daemavand: @Ujai321 I prefer not to sub and donate support via other means, but to hell with it :D
[0:37:17] jgbrit: I'm so back in to BGs, thank Goodness I can login again now
[0:37:31] wolfcloudchaser80: @Windstalker_dev And by the way, if you're still hanging around, there's HUGE interest in seeing WoW add player housing in this stream. Y'know, if you kept that sentiment in your back pocket.
[0:37:32] Daemavand: oh thats not why i'll deal with the ads lol
[0:37:37] Daemavand: I just believe in your work :D
[0:37:38] jeffdmk: Blame me
[0:37:44] Daemavand: anyway! how is HC!
[0:37:45] GreenArrowed: i haven't logged into WoW since i got my vicious mount
[0:37:51] jgbrit: I'm approaching 4k
[0:37:54] GreenArrowed: i'm good not looking at it again until next season
[0:38:06] Daemavand: It totally depends on how you do it eh
[0:38:08] jeffdmk: Also even if you make 7k you can fall back below it
[0:38:18] Ujai321: imagine they had /played in HS
[0:38:23] mererndl: hi hazel!! happy Saturday!
[0:38:29] eziekiyah: no no...mom's spaghetti
[0:38:32] breadthx: Hi there
[0:38:35] Ujai321: they do?
[0:38:47] jeffdmk: you dont need the pass for that
[0:38:50] breadthx: Hope your good hazel
[0:38:51] Ujai321: dang man
[0:39:07] breadthx: <3 <3
[0:39:15] Ujai321: that's an actual solid month
[0:39:49] jeffdmk: The current hs meta is annoying the quests are so unbalanced
[0:39:59] Windstalker_dev: We hear you on housing. We are listening and have heard that for years! What's your favorite housing system in an mmo?
[0:40:37] Ujai321: you win some, you lose some, and then you are close to 7k and are to scared to play
[0:40:58] jgbrit: I make the mistake of starting a BG while cooking. Obviously I have to let my food burn if it looks like I can win lol
[0:41:06] Ujai321: BGs really are just little roguelike rounds
[0:41:10] Decasin: i've been playing the cataclysm beta and it's been a blast palying through the cata zones
[0:41:19] wolfcloudchaser80: @Windstalker_dev I haven't played a ton of other MMOs, but ESO was my favorite.
[0:41:21] jeffdmk: Garrisons are the best housing system in an mmo
[0:41:30] olddelimatt: hey hazel, whats your thoughts on how the priest plays right now?
[0:41:32] blang32: Blackrock, because life is a game.
[0:41:38] Ujai321: good job of increasing your defense stat there, very clever
[0:43:15] olddelimatt: fair enough, I was switching between disc and shadow for a while
[0:43:19] Ujai321: or you just use PI like every other time
[0:43:28] Daemavand: I find at some point once you play a class enough, it becomes so familiar that its cozy
[0:43:46] Daemavand: I think there's specs I'd prefer more, but I'm way too attached to my warrior to switch
[0:43:52] Daemavand: That is such a good way of putting it <3
[0:44:04] cashthb: sup
[0:44:06] Ujai321: man i forgot how poor the droprate on those is
[0:44:11] Daemavand: and thats why I've been enjoying alts :D
[0:44:15] davis2882: you think they will open up burning crusade for hardcore classic
[0:44:20] cashthb: getting by
[0:44:41] Ujai321: kira really has just been on the edge there this whole time, hasnt she
[0:45:04] blang32: HC is about trolling people in a raid setting and uploading footage to Youtube.
[0:45:16] blang32: Just don't feed into it.
[0:45:36] Daemavand: Thats my plan lol
[0:45:45] jeffdmk: how excited are you for wod classic hardcore?
[0:45:46] Ujai321: you have a nice screenshot?
[0:46:04] Leterius: Whats current lvl cap in SoD?
[0:46:09] cashthb: maybe they should release a mode where your hard drive gets formatted if you die to add some real stakes
[0:46:17] Daemavand: @Leterius 40 i think
[0:46:21] McScooterson: Do we want a prediction today?
[0:46:36] damnwalter: Did you get a mount on your Warlock?
[0:46:48] Ujai321: "Top 4?"
[0:46:56] Ujai321: aw, that would have been funny
[0:47:51] Ujai321: if you had a channel point incentive to play an hour of a game on a variety day, how many points would that have to be?
[0:48:19] Daemavand: a million
[0:48:23] Daemavand: lol
[0:48:41] jeffdmk: oh i just saw someone come online that i have not seen online in years i wonder if they are coming back
[0:48:41] wolfcloudchaser80: But number go up. Even if fictional acorns.
[0:48:43] GustafTheSurvivor: it's for Gamba!
[0:48:57] rubibeya: Where do I do prediction
[0:49:37] McScooterson: "hazel does a swear" for 2mil
[0:49:43] GustafTheSurvivor: what if you die in less than 15 min D:
[0:49:50] rubibeya: Ok ty I'm on android  phone I'll do it on computer
[0:50:14] Ujai321: i honestly dont know if that would be fun
[0:50:30] jeffdmk: @GustafTheSurvivor that is why you should wait to vote until you have maximum info
[0:51:06] Ujai321: depends on the level, i guess, but it does clash with the chill vibe a little. but that might just be "i dont like change" talking, who is to say
[0:51:50] Ujai321: i trust that you could figure it out
[0:51:55] cashthb: what if it's a doom light show that's controlled by chat?
[0:52:08] goplacidly56: hazelWave
[0:52:28] cashthb: a light show that play doom
[0:52:31] Ujai321: are you asking chat for help? cause that is dangerous
[0:52:33] cashthb: *plays
[0:52:59] McScooterson: If a calculator can play doom, a light show can
[0:53:04] celiajolie: There's someone in my town that puts on a light show for Christmas every year and they match the lights to music on the radio. It always baffles me
[0:53:45] Ujai321: she does bite very hard
[0:53:54] Ujai321: and you hit not very hard?
[0:54:04] averageteacup: I feel sorry for the mobs, this hunter is murderous maniac :D
[0:54:13] cashthb: prolly your meta game to win wands dealt more damage than your white bow
[0:54:28] McScooterson: I forget hardcore rules for hunter pets. Do they not come back too?
[0:54:34] MrSpaceGrape: Just put all my points on the line for death c:
[0:54:34] Ujai321: oh you didnt shoot that thing, you hit it with your staff
[0:55:01] McScooterson: Knock on formica
[0:55:11] GustafTheSurvivor: Lola best scaly girl
[0:55:22] MrSpaceGrape: Best of bows. No judgement.
[0:55:25] KenzieDuckMoo: @MrSpaceGrape all in!
[0:55:45] MrSpaceGrape: Quite frankly I'm jealous of your amazing bow
[0:55:49] jeffdmk: you have a white bow lol you are such a newb do you even know how this game works
[0:56:00] cashthb: i wasn't making fun of it, ranged slot had like no stats on it
[0:56:05] McScooterson: Jeff, if I didn't know you
[0:56:24] MrSpaceGrape: @kenzieduckmoo risk it for the biscuit!!
[0:56:39] Ujai321: dont you need pvp rank for that or something
[0:56:40] jeffdmk: @McScooterson :)
[0:57:49] prince_adam76: Hello Hazel, hunters are the best pve class. Feign death get me out of jams alot.
[0:59:46] KenzieDuckMoo: @MrSpaceGrape my life for aiur!
[1:00:03] cashthb: hold up, wasn't that skinning cursor added in df?
[1:00:52] cashthb: my immersion is ruined
[1:01:11] rubibeya: I found it on my phone I had to click on the bubble by the chat box
[1:01:22] rubibeya: rubibeya watched 7 consecutive streams this month and sparked a watch streak! 
[1:01:57] Daemavand: The barrens is so massive D:

[1:05:16] cashthb: @Daemavand supprise yourself with a bionicle!
[1:05:24] Daemavand: That is exactly how I feel lol
[1:05:50] Daemavand: @cashthb i went to Europe recently I'm calling that my bday gift to myself :D
[1:05:56] averageteacup: feed Lola
[1:06:17] Daemavand: aww
[1:07:00] MayzenMe: jinx!
[1:07:02] russtrotter: go to target, buy an icee and popcorn at the entrance and then go hit the lego section.. now THATS a birthday
[1:07:06] tehl00py: *dies in the next 5 minutes* xP
[1:07:19] Daemavand: All you need is one close call
[1:07:24] Daemavand: and you'll feel more alive than ever lol
[1:07:32] rubibeya: Are you trying to make those that voted live 2nd guess the choice?
[1:08:01] Leterius: George R R Martin entered the chat
[1:08:26] Daemavand: I will still return to HC but I'm enjoying leveling a shaman in retail too much at the moment
[1:09:02] bustykrabb: What class would you least want to play in HCSF?
[1:09:17] Daemavand: No more snow? :D
[1:09:41] Daemavand: Gonna be rainy snowy here too the next few days, went for a long walk this AM before the weather turns later today
[1:09:47] Daemavand: Oh thats lovely
[1:10:10] Daemavand: Oh I'm like a dog and need to be walked every day lol
[1:10:16] Daemavand: so I do indeed plan this :D
[1:11:00] Daemavand: Its easy to get comfy at home! but I'm always happy when I step outside
[1:11:09] wolfcloudchaser80: Kinda the same way in Colorado. Though by the looks of things, the snow is going to melt a LOT today.
[1:11:57] tehl00py: rainy today where i am. still going outside tho, yay umbrellas!
[1:12:28] Daemavand: @tehl00py Rainy can still be lovely :D depends how windy it is
[1:12:55] Daemavand: I am also in the raincoat camp
[1:13:07] Daemavand: My hand gets too cold holding the umbrella
[1:13:29] Leterius: Windy+sandy is the worst. The eyes dont work anymore
[1:13:38] Daemavand: Oh yeah, thats the way to do it
[1:15:13] cashthb: I like umbrellas, I just take the rain in the wind and let my glorious mane fly, my problem with them is when there's someone else on the pavement who also has one and you don't have the space to pass normally
[1:16:42] wolfcloudchaser80: Yeah, and some people have partners who get cold fingers... who then warm them up by touching those icicle-fingers on my skin!
[1:17:29] Daemavand: the worst
[1:17:30] cashthb: they hurt?
[1:17:40] Daemavand: @cashthb yeah, it cramps
[1:17:43] jeffdmk: icicle fingers can feel nice on skin if you are warm enough
[1:18:23] russtrotter: my gf gets cold bum more than hands/feed and i get lots of "touch my bum" requests in the winter.. i don't mind
[1:18:28] crystalsing3r: That's when a nice hot bath or shower helps.
[1:18:45] wolfcloudchaser80: Cold toes usually means I fold up and tuck my feet under my legs cross-legged style.
[1:18:51] cashthb: ever considered being that person that sleeps in socks?
[1:18:55] Grez_1: Ah pre Cata Southern Barrens how I miss thee
[1:19:30] tehl00py: sleeping with socks on feels weird
[1:19:34] tehl00py: but sometimes hsa to be done
[1:19:59] Daemavand: I think you just need a foot kitty
[1:20:06] Daemavand: to borrow their heat :D
[1:20:16] Daemavand: lol
[1:20:39] Daemavand: of course, moving the sleeping cat makes one the worlds greatest monster
[1:21:07] tehl00py: i have an armpit kitty. the sweetest, but my armpits aren't cold
[1:22:13] cashthb: speaking of footware... this morning on youtube I saw an add for one of those cheap chinese crap webshops. The thing they advertised with was a big-ass plastic boot that you can fill with milk & fruits to make yourself a sha... -stomp as you do your shores
[1:22:36] cashthb: I'm not kiding
[1:22:40] Daemavand: what a time to be alive
[1:22:43] blueboywiz: Hi Hazel, I hope you are having a wonderful, wonderful day.
[1:22:51] Thesabreclaw: I love in Dragonflight showing Mankrik getting back on the horse again, so to speak, finding someone new to have in his life. :D
[1:23:17] wolfcloudchaser80: Yup, at the trader's post in Org.
[1:23:28] Thesabreclaw: Yes
[1:23:34] averageteacup: Old tricks to pull attention are not working, make something outrageous, people will talk about it
[1:23:42] Daemavand: Oh man, I saw the traders post this morning, and couldnt help myself to get the mount
[1:23:45] Thesabreclaw: and then in the Orc Heritage quest as well, you see him with her
[1:23:47] Daemavand: its just so colorful and goofy
[1:23:50] cashthb: maybe he just has a pet
[1:23:57] wolfcloudchaser80: Exactly. It's worth hanging out near there to hear that and some other flavor interactions.
[1:24:07] Daemavand: @Thesabreclaw Oh wow, I need to do that
[1:25:07] heldtheline: @wolfcloudchaser80 And in Stormwind, if you follow Flynn back to SI7, there's another little conversation to listen to.
[1:25:24] Thesabreclaw: @Daemavand Definitely worth the while; it was a good story. :)
[1:25:43] blueboywiz: im trying to get gold too for the gold scarab before they remove it
[1:25:47] wolfcloudchaser80: @heldtheline Oh, I don't think I've seen that one. I'll have to investigate.
[1:26:13] Thesabreclaw: Looking forward to the Troll and Draenei heritage quests, FINALLY coming in 10.2.7
[1:26:24] Hippwn: how many stable slots do you have in classic
[1:26:28] GhadaGaming: Hi Hazel, how u doing?
[1:26:57] GhadaGaming: I'm good, so no Saturday video this week?:(
[1:28:11] Daemavand: You could make a 2 min news video and fill it with 2 extra min of moose footage
[1:28:19] Daemavand: I dont think people would complain
[1:28:23] GhadaGaming: when do you think season 4 will come out?
[1:29:11] Thesabreclaw: Pretty sure S4 will be in April; after they lifted the cap on Crests
[1:29:21] s_0lst1ce: there is an 8 hour patch window next week, will we get 10.2.6 then do you think? Season 4 then a couple of weeks after
[1:30:27] Daemavand: Yeah I've been bouncing around different  games
[1:31:04] Daemavand: Yeah that would make sense
[1:31:11] Daemavand: I wouldnt mind seeing the DF dungeons again
[1:31:21] Daemavand: Except for Neltarius.
[1:31:37] Daemavand: lol
[1:31:49] Daemavand: RLP is awesome IMO its just the tuning that makes it awful
[1:31:55] MrSonicgen: Hello.
[1:32:13] Daemavand: ah yes lol

[1:40:17] wolfcloudchaser80: Like the music here.
[1:40:23] KingfisherGames: wow i just checked my progress towards 3000 quests completed?

[1:47:41] Daemavand: One thing I dont miss about HC/Vanilla is running out of quests relatively easily
[1:47:52] Daemavand: I have a hard time grinding for the sake of grinding
[1:48:34] Daemavand: Yeah, and thats just the nature of the game
[1:49:11] Daemavand: There's gotta be stats somewhere
[1:50:03] Daemavand: Oh thats so true, that was really fun with HC!
[1:50:14] Daemavand: and the death compilations...
[1:50:44] wolfcloudchaser80: Gravity, the most elite of mobs.
[1:50:54] Daemavand: Gravity and I are not friends :D
[1:51:01] Daemavand: lol
[1:52:02] Tiny_Teemo: are there still a lot of people playing HC?
[1:52:04] cashthb: you'll have all the time to level it up in silithus
[1:52:57] jeffdmk: song time
[1:53:54] Daemavand: I picked up, of all things, a fighting game on PS5 earlier today
[1:54:03] Daemavand: I was playing one with friends last weekend and forgot how fun they can be
[1:54:09] cashthb: anyway have you decided what you'll play in catassic?
[1:54:25] Aseopp: @Daemavand which one?
[1:54:40] Daemavand: I fully plan on refining my paniced button mashing!
[1:54:44] Daemavand: @Aseopp Tekken 8
[1:54:49] GustafTheSurvivor: truee
[1:54:58] Azuketsu: Oh Tekken 8 great game
[1:55:06] GreenArrowed: i miss the soul calibur competitions we used to have in high school
[1:55:35] Daemavand: @Azuketsu Oh yeah we had a blast! I havent touched the genre in a decade or more
[1:56:28] Aseopp: I was looking at street fighter last night on steam
[1:57:31] Ujai321: hey, we are still alive! and we made it to 20
[1:58:16] Daemavand: Flabby, surely
[1:58:43] Daemavand: that sounds like fun :D
[1:59:02] jeffdmk: I am nervous that enough people play duos
[1:59:10] cashthb: don't worry, my Mom owns blizzard and she told me it will be released with the ow2 pve patch
[1:59:50] Perkolate: I think its 8 ppl 4 teams of 2
[2:00:18] Perkolate: but i could be making up something in my head that i'm trying to remember from blizzcon
[2:01:03] Perkolate: Just imagine if you get a blue drop you can use
[2:02:27] GreenArrowed: but shoulders!
[2:04:27] Thesabreclaw: The real deep decision is yet to come: to don a helm for more stats, or keep that glorious hair, since there's no transmog. hazelOmg
[2:04:57] Thesabreclaw: Oh! I forgot that QoL was in Classic!
[2:05:51] morningporr1dge: sod hc?
[2:06:02] Daemavand: @morningporr1dge self-found HC
[2:06:15] morningporr1dge: yea but it is it sod
[2:06:31] Ruddyt11: Hazel playing SOD?
[2:06:39] Perkolate: Not SoD
[2:06:40] morningporr1dge: is it*
[2:06:47] Thesabreclaw: No, there are no runes from SoD in HC Self Found
[2:06:57] morningporr1dge: i mean you can play hc selfound anywhere u want :D
[2:08:54] GreenArrowed: man, i haven't heard this music in so long
[2:13:55] MrSonicgen: Heading out. Goodbye.
[2:14:05] silverfoxgaming71: is this sod or retail?
[2:14:19] Perkolate: Not SoD. Hardcore Classic Realms
[2:14:34] silverfoxgaming71: thanks
[2:14:44] Hippwn: I finished getting all the mark of honor mage sets today made me think how you did that on your druid
[2:14:52] Daemavand: I'm leving in Tiragarde sound
[2:14:56] Daemavand: and it makes me so cozy
[2:15:40] Daemavand: Its about the experience :D
[2:15:54] Hippwn: Lola is so cute with her woddle haha
[2:16:21] Daemavand: I mean, if I had a tail I'd do the same
[2:16:24] sspacebuns: Hunter is pretty difficult to learn in Classic yea?
[2:16:48] cashthb: maybe it has a Shadriss boss fight
[2:17:08] ChrossTTV: LuvSign LuvSign LuvSign
[2:17:55] Daemavand: Are you still playing Palworld?
[2:17:55] cashthb: you could do wolf among us before the sequel comes out!
[2:18:17] Daemavand: Thats fine! Was curious
[2:18:18] fattymoo_: same exact thing happened to me with palworld. wow got too addictive lol
[2:19:14] Daemavand: Wow is just something thats nice to come back too :D
[2:19:15] cashthb: when companies declare bankruptcy they are usually trying to save their hide, if they go under they just stop existing
[2:19:41] fattymoo_: is there a reason you chose a crocalisk? or just cause CUTE?
[2:19:53] Daemavand: Anyone else create little backstories for their WoW toons in their head? or is that just me
[2:19:55] Daemavand: I have fun with that
[2:20:39] Daemavand: I was JUST thinking about that :D
[2:20:45] wolfcloudchaser80: @Daemavand Oh yeah. I don't roleplay live, but all my characters have a history.
[2:21:05] GreenArrowed: @Daemavand i doooo! i play d&d with one of mine
[2:21:12] Daemavand: She's vulpera and I think she's just going to be the BFF of my HM druid
[2:21:31] Daemavand: and okay thats cool that y'all do it the same :D
[2:22:02] Aseopp: For character backstory I often choose one small part of my personality, and then blow it completely out of proportion, just to see where it goes.
[2:22:36] Aseopp: Now i feel prompted haha
[2:22:48] Daemavand: Ooh thats fun!
[2:24:53] neuroxin2777: good evening! first time here, how is it going?

[2:27:32] kloppzy: heyyy hazel it’s been a while, how’re all the plants doing? you were on a craze last time i watched lol
[2:29:01] kloppzy: my pc decided to kick the bucket a few months back so have been stuck playing on the ps5, i miss wow so much lol
[2:29:24] Daemavand: I feel that pain, I hope you get one soon D:
[2:29:32] Daemavand: but yeah console life is incredibly comfy
[2:29:40] Daemavand: I've been enjoying my Switch a lot
[2:29:52] Aseopp: Some day I will play wow from my sofa
[2:29:56] Beorn_of_the_NorthernSea: I logged into youtube and didn't see a Hazel video yet.
[2:29:59] GreenArrowed: i've been looking for some coxy pre bed gaming for my switch
[2:30:27] wolfcloudchaser80: I started looking into a Switch, but the games are pretty expensive.
[2:30:41] kybakii: are there many people playing self found? i havent seen many people talking about it
[2:31:04] heldtheline: I like how most of us are like it's not Saturday without a Hazel video :D
[2:31:07] Aseopp: Yea, the input devices will be tricky
[2:31:15] mustaxeuaj: HAZEL!!! missed you and I just wanna thank you so much for all the guides in bfa-DF bfa was the main one for my heroic raiding guild ❤️❤️❤️
[2:32:01] cashthb: khmit might be worth wating for handheld pcs to get strong enough to properly emulate switchkhm, damn my throat must really be acting up
[2:32:46] mustaxeuaj: the ny’alotha one helped a lot and we got our AOTC/Mount the 3rd week that raid dropped and we celebrated in your name
[2:32:54] fattymoo_: S A M E !!!!
[2:33:00] wolfcloudchaser80: I tried Yuzu, but it was really janky and had lots of lag.
[2:33:14] mustaxeuaj: ^^^ favorite raid forever and ever lol
[2:33:19] GustafTheSurvivor: HS SS were the best remake imo
[2:33:23] GustafTheSurvivor: miss those games
[2:33:34] GustafTheSurvivor: HG*
[2:33:37] Danoria: Does anyone know if Sepulcher is soloable at 70?
[2:33:43] cashthb: the ability to play hg/ss or black/white on my phone during some lectures was a life saver
[2:34:16] mustaxeuaj: it kinda is but not as easy as you think
[2:34:23] sixforate: could you tell me why there are red blotches on your map?
[2:34:26] GustafTheSurvivor: same! i had blue and i got silver and crystal as gifts, still have the game boy

[2:34:52] mustaxeuaj: welcome paka
[2:35:08] GreenArrowed: @sixforate places where people die often in HC
[2:35:14] mustaxeuaj: ty for the resub
[2:35:40] cashthb: ds/3ds games are pretty hard to re release due to the lack of 2nd screen
[2:36:01] furiforever: You have to live today, i bet 20k on living to troll another day.
[2:36:15] cashthb: that's a great idea
[2:36:45] sixforate: thank you
[2:36:48] cashthb: actually, than you can't play hand held, you must default to the 2 small screens on your actual screen
[2:37:31] mustaxeuaj: week 3 still no legendary for my warrior lol
[2:37:50] cashthb: it's actually not that bad - as I mentioned I played that way, but I would expect way more from an official release
[2:38:18] fattymoo_: very true
[2:38:48] PaperJax: They did re-do Diamond and Pearl (for what they are worth) which were originally on the DS. They would just need to rearrange the UI a little.
[2:38:50] fattymoo_: did you ever play archaeus
[2:39:14] GustafTheSurvivor: what got me mad at nintendo and the pokemon company is how rich they are, and still they were able to make a game less appealing than palworld, which was beautiful and incredibly fun
[2:39:44] cashthb: they were going downhill since gen 5, it sadly turned into a free fall since us/um
[2:39:50] eternitycrystal: Hello Hazel!
[2:41:06] cashthb: @PaperJax those were remakes not just rereleases
[2:41:11] GustafTheSurvivor: the last good remake imo was pokemon lets go pikachu/eevee, fun game and great art/graphics
[2:41:43] GustafTheSurvivor: KEKW

[2:46:19] JimmyJosser: I vividly remember finishing college for the day and running frantically down the street to find a Squirtle on the busted pokémon tracker thing it originally had
[2:46:24] GustafTheSurvivor: YUP! i bought a thermal water bottle, extra battery charger, lots of equipment to play pokemon go
[2:47:40] JimmyJosser: Last time I played was when they added gen 3 pokémon
[2:48:15] GustafTheSurvivor: i remember the video of a BUNCH of people running to a park to catch a vaporeon
[2:48:45] cashthb: I remember sideloading it weeks before it was released in eu, farming a shit ton of pigey and I decided that with a head start like that imma be the pigeot lord of the region... then I realized that all the gymns were taken already... then I acidentally turned my pigeot into candy while I was drunk... then I stopped playing!
[2:48:55] GreenArrowed: my laundromat was a gym so i'd spend my saturday mornings recapturing it
[2:49:24] GustafTheSurvivor: @JimmyJosser it is still going strong, but people losing interest cause niantic is making it more and more cash grabbing
[2:49:47] elliemooniee: hiya hazel been a while since ive been able to pop in a stream but glad to be here!
[2:49:49] cashthb: all my friends who bullied me for it during that 2-3 days felt real stupid once it became the biggest thing
[2:49:55] jeffdmk: I always wondered if there was ever irl violence because of the gym thing
[2:50:16] Daemavand: That I remember
[2:50:29] fattymoo_: woohooooo
[2:50:32] Thesabreclaw: Ding!
[2:50:46] GustafTheSurvivor: congratz!
[2:51:11] GustafTheSurvivor: so, 2 levels today?
[2:51:29] cashthb: we were messing aroung with a friend that we'll be team rocket... I won't get into details
[2:52:16] GustafTheSurvivor: yeah, pretty fast for a 3 hour session
[2:53:29] Thesabreclaw: Been wanting to set aside time to set up my Steam Deck to do Pet Battles on the couch (when I'm at my big screen PC, I want to work on my character). But Blizz won't give us pet battles on phones, so Steam Deck it is.
[2:54:09] Thesabreclaw: hehe... a trusted friend :D
[2:55:19] Aseopp: What patch?
[2:55:32] GreenArrowed: i'd be so surprised if they dropped a patch without a post first
[2:55:34] Aseopp: the eyepatch.. gotcha
[2:55:36] randolph_carter90: background music of the barrens never gets old
[2:55:37] medvet03: Tuesday is a long weekly reset, so hopefully.
[2:55:39] GreenArrowed: not against it
[2:55:46] GreenArrowed: i'd like somethign new to play
[2:55:47] cashthb: that will also come out with ow2 pve
[2:56:00] GreenArrowed: @Aseopp very good
