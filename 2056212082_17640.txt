[5:48:59] JustRewind: @JustRewind The game is most fun IMO when its a new xpac, or a new season with a new raid and dungeons. We're pretty deep into this season so most people are done with this content, and next season is fated with nothing new until TWW.
[5:49:34] Aidanh999: @JustRewind ok that makes sense thanks for the in depth response :)
