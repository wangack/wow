[0:15:51] BBMezzy: That manuscript's droprate doesn't feel much better.. up to 176 kills for it and still nothing
[0:16:16] MediumRareOG: 550 KILLS, NO MOUNT, NO SKIN
[0:16:32] NuttyNatsu: As of today, I just need the mount
[0:16:33] physalis4: are there rewards for archavist?
[0:16:33] nash25pl: MDI weekend what you think @MrGM
[0:16:42] physalis4: archavist rep
[0:16:47] Lausten: mrgmHelloThere
[0:16:51] Elrathir: it was a solid reaction
[0:17:12] volkreig: got my first mythic kill last night when it’s current content feel quite proud
[0:17:25] MediumRareOG: MY PALADIN DID GET THE WEATHERED JIM TRINKET THO, WHICH WAS NICE, IT EVEN HAS A SOCKET

[0:18:15] Layliah79: it's the game not you! mrgmL
[0:18:29] Suze_o_0: dude, my heart just dropped lmao
[0:18:30] Lausten: Its not about being good or bad at the game @MrGM its about doing the content. You only learn by doing it over and over again.
[0:18:33] Elrathir: classic wochi behaviour :P
[0:18:48] KaisenSiru: Sadge
[0:18:59] nash25pl: @MrGM u wanna hear fun fact about my personal WOW achievement I am 1 healer away (shaman) to get all dung tps this season
[0:19:20] Lausten: Im the exact same as you Dan, I get "carried" by my guild each season, but I dont care, they do maybe 10-15-20 times as many dungeons in a season as I do..
[0:20:00] BBMezzy: You should try the No Pressure discord community if you're looking to PuG M+
[0:20:30] Layliah79: WCM is one of the easier ones to leave till last! on the positive!
[0:20:34] volkreig: I feel like raiding (apart from mythic) is probably more chill than 20s
[0:21:25] Layliah79: almost there!
[0:21:59] Shrapnel_Sponge: it's a marathon, not a sprint mate
[0:22:01] Lausten: Dont compare yourself with those gotta go fast streamers..
[0:22:02] NuttyNatsu: eh nothing wrong with that
[0:22:04] Layliah79: what's the rush tho?! unless u plan on leveling multiple classes there is no time demand IMO
[0:22:10] Suze_o_0: dude, its not how fast you level, its enjoying the content
[0:22:16] volkreig: I’m only 30, I just enjoy questing in the evening after work
[0:22:21] Layliah79: @Suze_o_0 %
[0:22:30] Layliah79: 100%
[0:22:36] Suze_o_0: my mom just went back to an old realm [after all the level squish] and started levelig them to 30
[0:22:41] MediumRareOG: WoW dungeons for me: second week of SL I got yelled at for not knowing a skip in a Heroic PUG and I peaced out
[0:22:46] nash25pl: @MrGM what i was going to say that i play all healer specs in retail and shaman is only one to get it done now :)   on the other topic love your content !
[0:22:51] Shrapnel_Sponge: tbh, I've not done any content for a while. I said goodbye to my dad on Saturday who passed from a sudden downward turn. I've not even touched gaming at all.
[0:23:19] Layliah79: Aww i'm so sorry to hear that @Shrapnel_Sponge Hugs <3
[0:23:22] skewlbeta: <3 <3 <3 <3

[0:26:15] MediumRareOG: Oh wait, Jungle Remedy is the Kurzen camp with the medicine men? Yeah, that sucks if there's competition
[0:26:19] Pumba2988: farm the water elementals on that island  n/west side of STV
[0:26:58] volkreig: questing you can do at your own pace tbh
[0:27:26] demololtv: it gives the same % at any level
[0:27:30] demololtv: id use it at 38-40
[0:28:16] NuttyNatsu: ah checking on my classic wrath hunter now. I started one but didn't get far
[0:28:30] Lausten: Was never in retail vanilla, it was added later to compensate
[0:30:08] nash25pl: <3
[0:30:41] RAF_Sean: Huge gains lol
[0:31:03] RAF_Sean: Are mounts still 100g? Am I remembering that correct?
[0:31:10] nash25pl: u can see when i was not playing KEKW
[0:31:38] winsko_: @RAF_Sean base cost 100, 10% discount for honored and 10% for r3 pvp

[0:33:23] MediumRareOG: start doing dragon soul 15 times a week
[0:33:39] nash25pl: ofc !
[0:33:45] nash25pl: always time walking raid just for funz of it
[0:33:54] Forgiven78: G'Morning, Dan.
[0:34:13] demololtv: HAHA
[0:34:21] Bware2: that looked empty :)
[0:34:23] Minobard: its a naked simple armory

[0:37:12] Hirindar: SL was awful, didnt get a single oozing necrorya egg
[0:37:22] physalis4: 862
[0:37:22] demololtv: yeah but does HE have all the saddles
[0:37:35] BBMezzy: I know :( Stopped mythic raiding at the end of WoD

[0:38:38] demololtv: looks like mine
[0:38:51] Hirindar: you got some collecting ot do!
[0:38:57] s7wede: Shadowlands is a ton of grinding, it's not hard. Just incredibly frustrating
[0:39:27] nash25pl: can we have ability to queue for warfronts in 5 man or solo :(  I cant farm the tokens from darkshore too well for last 2 mounts
[0:39:44] physalis4: once they pulled the rip cord in SL mount it opened the door for a lot of mount farming
[0:40:03] mikeygames: Hey all, hey Dan, how's things?
[0:40:10] SlithTheSivak: what about the swift zulian tiger?
[0:40:26] nash25pl: all of shadowlands is easy to solo except raids atm
[0:40:51] mikeygames: not too bad thanks, hit 40 and finally sold some stuff on the AH to pay for mount
[0:40:58] Arlaeya: I've been grinding Avowed rep which is unfun, but easy as far as killing stuff
[0:41:47] nash25pl: Avowed took me one weekend to grind in raid group  it was a weekend of junk food killing rares and watching netflix on 2nd screen
[0:41:49] MediumRareOG: I'll do SL when it becomes trivial in TWW
[0:41:52] necrowoof: which patch do you think will have the bfa soloable raids?
[0:41:56] demololtv: did they announce when alpha is
[0:41:56] Pumba2988: is the pirate patch gonna drop a week before 10.2.6?
[0:42:04] Arlaeya: Only worth doing on a Revendreth toon though as only they can get the mount from Avowed
[0:42:08] KaisenSiru: I had all the Shadowland mounts completed not too long after ZM Hit. I was doing all covenent stuff on 4 characters at the start
[0:43:08] S3N71: Good afternoon MrGM and stream chat
[0:44:01] nash25pl: yeah when SL came out in S2 i was grinding it all on 3-4 chars  only issue was not being able to skip first campain which is a pain in the ass if you want the full mog
[0:44:02] mikeygames: afternoon

[0:45:56] MediumRareOG: yes, account bound
[0:46:19] SlithTheSivak: r u watching halo season 2?
[0:46:42] SlithTheSivak: if u skipped season 1 u wouldnt miss much
[0:46:44] Lausten: All manuscripts, covenant thingys are bugged and show as not collected at the moment
[0:47:00] nuclearphosphate: @SlithTheSivak loving the halo series so far
[0:47:12] nuclearphosphate: bloody brilliant
[0:47:12] SlithTheSivak: season 2 is legit great
[0:47:32] physalis4: lol I just leveled up farming for the love rocket
[0:47:41] nash25pl: ok as nice this was time for MrGM background mode as i need to do some work ;-;
[0:47:44] Pumba2988: i started watching the SILO pretty good show
[0:47:53] nuclearphosphate: there was a LOT of people getting pissy cause masterchief has his helmet off in it which i think is just being pissy for the sake of being pissy
[0:48:30] nuclearphosphate: cause the masterchief never has his helmet off in the game (lets face it, you are in first person so it doesnt matter in the game)
[0:49:00] nuclearphosphate: did u hear of the new fantastic four casting? i think its gonna be epic
[0:49:05] nuclearphosphate: pedro pascal FTW
[0:49:07] SlithTheSivak: The guy who plays The Thing is freaking perfect
[0:49:12] RAF_Sean: Oh was there an announcement?
[0:49:15] skewlbeta: I mean it's got pedro pascal - what not to like
[0:49:17] physalis4: Did you see all the bad reviews Madam Web is getting
[0:49:23] skewlbeta: @SlithTheSivak isn't it the guy from the bear?
[0:49:50] mikeygames: wonder how many times they'll reboot the fantastic four, until it's actually good
[0:49:51] SlithTheSivak: @skewlbeta yes! cousin!
[0:50:00] s7wede: it's fucking horrendous
[0:50:07] nuclearphosphate: @physalis4 i never go by reviews, if folk just went by reviews, folk would NEVER go to the cinema or play anything
[0:50:17] Suze_o_0: i can't see her as Madame Web, after 50 shades XD
[0:50:20] Demeternoth: good afternoon :)
[0:50:27] SlithTheSivak: ew, hope they dont let lauren bobert in
[0:50:27] nuclearphosphate: ..... why the hell would you want a bed?
[0:50:36] KaisenSiru: Beds Pog
[0:50:37] Minobard: BYOS  - bring your own sheets
[0:50:41] mikeygames: beds? lmao, singles and doubles I imagine
[0:50:41] Demeternoth: o not take a black light into that cinema XD
[0:50:52] Forgiven78: Not sure i'd be down for beds in a cinema
[0:50:52] Lausten: So the dads and moms can get a shut eye while the kids watch movies? Kappa
[0:50:53] Akela3: movies in bed are the best
[0:50:53] Suze_o_0: Dan, I posted some pics of outside our house in General Chat on discord
[0:51:02] nuclearphosphate: yeah.... hell no
[0:51:06] KaisenSiru: anniesCozy
[0:51:09] SlithTheSivak: casting couch for a porn website
[0:51:18] Minobard: weird hand jibbers getting done under blankeys there
[0:51:28] magemaster225: front row though
[0:51:29] physalis4: I would never sit in a public bed like that
[0:51:30] nuclearphosphate: cineworld unlimited is much better then odeon
[0:51:34] physalis4: you think they clean that?
[0:51:42] physalis4: Don't bring a blacklight in there
[0:51:57] demololtv: for sure
[0:52:00] Arlaeya: people gonna people
[0:52:00] SlithTheSivak: people do funny business in the regular seats
[0:52:01] demololtv: i would
[0:52:03] demololtv: ima dog
[0:52:05] physalis4: there is so much jiz on those
[0:52:06] Demeternoth: if you think they're not you'd be wrong
[0:52:12] mikeygames: how much is a 'bed' ticket ha
[0:52:28] Annathebanana1986: Good afternoon
[0:52:29] SlithTheSivak: cheaper per hour than one of those hotels...
[0:52:35] nuclearphosphate: i pay £135 a year for my cineworld unlimited
[0:52:44] S3N71: @SlithTheSivak lol
[0:53:07] mikeygames: I really wanted to see Godzilla Minus One in open matte
[0:54:13] nuclearphosphate: i wanna see godzilla minus one but the only f**kin screen my cinema shows it is in the VIP screen which is ridiculously overpriced half arsed, half cooked food with really uncomfy seats and all you can eat popcorn, snacks and drinks
[0:54:44] mikeygames: it had a black and white release in Japan in January, hope it comes to the UK
[0:54:45] Demeternoth: I heartily recommend G-1, a freaking SPLENDID movie
[0:54:48] Tauren0309: In 4 weeks and I'm in Europe, so looking forward. Haven't been there in 26 years... Sure alot changed

[0:55:31] nuclearphosphate: ive seen it its f**kin brilliant
[0:55:38] s7wede: Don't waste your time
[0:55:40] nuclearphosphate: as i say do NOT go by reviews or no one will go to see anything
[0:56:01] nuclearphosphate: honestly, if everyone went by others reviews no one would see a thing or do a thing
[0:56:01] Tauren0309: @S3N71 Nope was a working Holidayer from South Africa
[0:56:02] s7wede: dude, the main villain is indecipherable
[0:56:10] s7wede: you can't understand a word he fucking says
[0:56:12] mikeygames: Sydney Sweeny
[0:56:33] Sery_Bot: The ad break is finishing now! seryboLove
[0:56:38] physalis4: I mean reviews do serve a purpose or nobody would write them
[0:56:42] S3N71: I'll wait until it's free on Disney Plus.  That's not a reflection on the movie, I just wait for everything to come to Disney Plus these days
[0:57:07] S3N71: I also have NetFlix and Amazon ;-)
[0:57:12] s7wede: Honestly if you even think this movie is passable there is an issue
[0:57:24] magemaster225: just wait for apple to buy disney, then buyout sony
[0:57:28] nuclearphosphate: @physalis4 no they dont, its just keyboard warriors, seriously tho, those people that go by reviews for everything i seriously question. if folk went by reviews for everything in the world, no one would do anything in life
[0:57:30] MachoCham: I enjoyed the original Venom PepeHands
[0:57:32] s7wede: We had 5 people in the cinema
[0:57:36] s7wede: and 2 walked out
[0:57:47] Demeternoth: @MachoCham KNobhead <3
[0:57:53] Demeternoth: I also liked Venom XD
[0:57:54] Suze_o_0: ahhh really? i love Venom, both of them, and Marvels was well good, i even lol'd loudly at some points
[0:58:09] Suze_o_0: yup
[0:58:29] Suze_o_0: the Character
[0:58:29] nuclearphosphate: i loved everything about venom, let there be carnage, and marvels
[0:58:32] Suze_o_0: :P
[0:58:33] MachoCham: @Demeternoth Demeternob <3
[0:58:43] s7wede: The entire film is a giant Pepsi commercial
[0:58:50] S3N71: Did Tom Hardy star in Legend?
[0:58:50] Demeternoth: I liked VENOM XD - Tom Hardy is fine, but I'm not a die-hard fan
[0:58:54] MachoCham: Also it's art. People are allowed to enjoy different things
[0:59:12] Demeternoth: @S3N71 yep :)
[0:59:19] Suze_o_0: the story was a fit far fetched for me, but following marvel with their alien invasions, it follows suit XD
[0:59:20] KaisenSiru: Madam Web Pog
[0:59:25] S3N71: @Demeternoth Epic movie :)
[0:59:47] nuclearphosphate: yeah they are doing away with post credit scenes, (FINALLY)
[0:59:50] MediumRareOG: i've seen movies for free and still felt robbed. 2 hours of my life i'll never get back
[0:59:51] KaisenSiru: They were planning for it to be, but then changed their minds
[0:59:58] s7wede: it's connected to upcoming projects such as Hawkwoman and Spiderwoman
[1:00:00] Demeternoth: @S3N71 absolutely agree :)
[1:00:03] nuclearphosphate: marvel, from madam web onwards
[1:00:15] physalis4: who doesn't like post credit scenes????
[1:00:36] MachoCham: Gonna need a source
[1:00:52] s7wede: The opening is the Marvel logo, and it's smashed by the Sony Logo
[1:01:20] demololtv: chat

[1:01:25] physalis4: BillyApprove
[1:01:25] keyboardturner: BabyYodaSip
[1:01:26] nuclearphosphate: @KaisenSiru nah they are genuinly not doing any more
[1:01:27] Lausten: Hello Chad
[1:01:27] MachoCham: It was because I asked for a source on the internet
[1:01:28] nuclearphosphate: thankfully
[1:01:31] Suze_o_0: yea it does that sometimes for me too
[1:01:35] Tauren0309: mrgmHelloThere
[1:01:57] nuclearphosphate: not facebook, my cinema website news page
[1:02:52] s7wede: Madam web wasn't marvel. it was Sony in conjunction with Marvel
[1:03:03] KaisenSiru: @nuclearphosphate I meant for Madam Web connecting to the story they had in mind, but decided to declare it as a standalone thing
[1:03:33] nuclearphosphate: the trailer for that kraven film doesnt do it for me
[1:03:39] mikeygames: did you watch The Iron Claw movie?
[1:04:23] MachoCham: Spider-Man prints too much money
[1:04:26] nuclearphosphate: the spiderman films have really lost their way, and please do not get me started on how bad the games are since the PS2 era
[1:04:53] keyboardturner: i love spiderman 2 on ps2
[1:04:53] MachoCham: That's a hot take
[1:04:54] physalis4: That's a spicy take
[1:04:56] nuclearphosphate: im being serious
[1:05:02] keyboardturner: the pizza delivery music is the best
[1:05:23] nuclearphosphate: they are so mid
[1:05:24] keyboardturner: https://youtu.be/czTksCF6X8Y best music ever
[1:05:29] MachoCham: Tom Holland is the best Spider-Man
[1:05:42] Demeternoth: How you going to dog on 'No Way Home'??
[1:05:51] Haestoh: pffft not even 40 yet Kappa
[1:06:08] s7wede: After saying madam web was good, That take makes sense
[1:06:29] Demeternoth: NWH is hands down one of the best movies of the last 20 years, not just in the MCU.
[1:06:34] nuclearphosphate: @Demeternoth went on for far too long, far too convoluted, no genuinely interesting villain
[1:06:58] MachoCham: And if you're including the Into the Spiderverse series in that then my friend you're just flat out wrong as that first film is a masterpiece
[1:07:18] Demeternoth: @nuclearphosphate wowzers couldn't disagree more XD
[1:07:31] Demeternoth: @MachoCham Yep also superb films
[1:07:53] nuclearphosphate: i do
[1:08:01] KaisenSiru: anniesGasp anniesGasp
[1:08:13] nuclearphosphate: hands down
[1:08:42] Disjoint_Dwarf: roguel21Surprised roguel21Surprised roguel21Surprised
[1:08:44] Demeternoth: this actually hurts my heart
[1:08:56] keyboardturner: tbh i've liked all the films so far that i've seen (especially spiderverse / NWH and i honestly just love the original tobey maguire ones a lot even if they're corny and sort of a relic of their time
[1:09:08] Demeternoth: Imma go buy a Spidey shirt for LFG now XD
[1:09:19] nuclearphosphate: Alita: Battle Angel
[1:09:32] s7wede: Madam Web is so bad, Dakota Johnson fired her PR team the day after the first trailer aired. It was a complete and utter shitshow
[1:09:32] keyboardturner: i quote the tobey maguire spidermans all the time lmao
[1:09:59] KaisenSiru: KEKW
[1:10:03] s7wede: It's based on an Anime
[1:10:06] Demeternoth: @keyboardturner they are great movies, very of their time :D
[1:10:09] DevoidX: Alite: Battle Angel is brilliant
[1:10:13] nuclearphosphate: yeah, its brilliant
[1:10:14] s7wede: obviously the anime is better than the live action
[1:10:21] magemaster225: its not a bad movie, theyre supposed to be making a sequel
[1:10:42] nuclearphosphate: @magemaster225 they are
[1:10:51] skewlbeta: I swear I've barely heard anything about DIsney IPs lately
[1:10:59] S3N71: My Private Idaho is my best movie ever
[1:11:01] s7wede: Hollywood needs to leave anime alone
[1:11:06] MachoCham: We got news the other day of Moana 2
[1:11:31] s7wede: It should never be live action, but rather wait for the technology to advance to the point where everything is really good CGI
[1:11:38] MachoCham: Yep my favourite Disney film of them all
[1:11:39] Demeternoth: It is a good film! SHINY!
[1:11:39] nuclearphosphate: its alright, not great
[1:11:44] skewlbeta: they seem to have lost the plot a bit. Wasn't Wish supposed to be their big thing for the 50th anniversary?
[1:11:51] Demeternoth: OK @nuclearphosphate what about Tangled??
[1:11:51] wastedxtime93: The water song goes hard tho...
[1:11:52] nuclearphosphate: nope
[1:11:53] MediumRareOG: ngl i'll be glad to move on from the superhero genre. i feel like it's been done

[1:12:42] Demeternoth: @nuclearphosphate sadge
[1:12:51] magemaster225: have you ever walked out of a movie, could be your first
[1:13:00] skewlbeta: Dan watches american films all the time! XD
[1:13:03] skewlbeta: very foreign
[1:13:09] nuclearphosphate: only movie ive walked out of was the greatest shiteman
[1:13:28] S3N71: Is it me, or has it all gone quiet on the James Bond front?
[1:13:32] Sery_Bot: The ad break is finishing now! seryboLove
[1:13:42] MachoCham: @S3N71 Turns out it was his time to die
[1:13:44] skewlbeta: almost walked out of wonder woman because of the d*ck jokes.
[1:13:47] nuclearphosphate: cant stand musicals, and had no idea it was a musical when i went in
[1:14:26] nuclearphosphate: @skewlbeta the wonder woman films were brilliant
[1:14:30] keyboardturner: tbh i can't really stay focused on a movie that isn't in a language i understand
[1:14:34] nuclearphosphate: DCEU cant go wrong (aside from spiderman)
[1:14:42] nuclearphosphate: cant stand it
[1:14:47] keyboardturner: if i'm solely focusing on subtitles i zone out of it
[1:14:49] skewlbeta: She sees Chris Pine for the first time and he's naked or something and he's like "Oh it's bigger normall I swear" or something to that effect and I was just *sigh*
[1:15:12] MediumRareOG: i share that chatter's hatred of musicals. they's so cheesy
[1:15:21] KaisenSiru: anniesSHY
[1:15:35] DevoidX: @MediumRareOG agreed.
[1:15:49] nuclearphosphate: that was cringeworthy
[1:15:54] SlithTheSivak: xmen 97 trailer just dropped!
[1:16:01] gobdokon: musicals make me cringe so hard i cant stand them lol
[1:16:15] magemaster225: they really cheaped on the animation on this
[1:16:20] MachoCham: XXX: Return of Xander Cage was the closest I got to walking out a film
[1:17:02] nuclearphosphate: oh god its not an anime xmen is it?
[1:17:28] physalis4: This is gonna be great
[1:17:30] MachoCham: This theme....
[1:17:36] MachoCham: Activated my soul
[1:17:43] SlithTheSivak: gambit riding wolverine...
[1:17:50] physalis4: @nuclearphosphate The og animated show style
[1:17:55] Demeternoth: i got chills :D
[1:18:05] HaloS23: :O
[1:18:10] nuclearphosphate: @physalis4 not a fan of animated style
[1:18:14] HaloS23: on D+!!!!
[1:18:34] skewlbeta: looking forward to the mandalorian movie
[1:18:45] SlithTheSivak: it does damage the marvel brand
[1:18:55] MachoCham: I think it's just been a lack luster phase
[1:19:05] S3N71: I'm gonna watch Madam Web and make my own mind up
[1:19:36] MachoCham: Is Iron Claw coming to a streaming service?
[1:20:00] s7wede: Well after the marvels crashed and burned they announced that they were going to slow down and focus on quality rather than rapid fire releases. They cancelled quite a bit of phase 5 and so far there are only 3 known projects so there is some hope left
[1:20:00] S3N71: Blimey, that is late!
[1:20:42] s7wede: They have lost the director for the Thunderbolts like 3 times
[1:20:48] MachoCham: Layer change?
[1:21:52] MachoCham: That's careless
[1:22:14] Suze_o_0: omg dan? have you done time rifts?
[1:22:27] MachoCham: I love Brie Larson so I'm bias
[1:22:27] Suze_o_0: do you collect pets?
[1:22:37] Suze_o_0: have you seen jeepers???
[1:22:54] Layliah79: Ms Marvel's actress is a lot of fun with the part
[1:22:54] Suze_o_0: one eyes bat looking thing
[1:23:15] s7wede: Honestly the best part of the Marvels was Iman Vellani, The others looked out of place and hammy
[1:23:16] SlithTheSivak: Ms. Marvel and I have the same crocs
[1:23:17] nuclearphosphate: couldnt stand ms marvel
[1:23:27] nuclearphosphate: couldnt even get past 1 episode
[1:23:32] Suze_o_0: oh shit, sorry yea
[1:23:41] Big_Rum: Good Morning my friend and Hello There!
[1:23:57] Suze_o_0: i only watched like 2 ep of Ms Marvel, but I liked Echo
[1:23:57] MachoCham: Die Hard or Madam Web?
[1:24:08] nuclearphosphate: madam web
[1:24:13] Suze_o_0: Die Hard
[1:24:19] wastedxtime93: Madam Web or A Serbian Film?
[1:24:24] nuclearphosphate: im not, die hard is not as good as folk keep saying it is
[1:24:32] nuclearphosphate: not to mention its NOT a christmas film
[1:24:36] wastedxtime93: DONT LOOK IT UP
[1:24:59] s7wede: ok I'm going to test this. What line is changed at the end of the film that is iconic to spiderman Nuclearphosphate
[1:25:00] S3N71: @wastedxtime93 That was so bad, it was good
[1:25:17] demololtv: YES LOL
[1:25:22] MachoCham: Madam Web or Godfather?
[1:25:25] demololtv: its a 10 min thing too lmao
[1:25:36] nuclearphosphate: madam web, godfather is mid
[1:25:37] demololtv: bro went to SM and captured a gnome lock and dropped him off at sylvanus
[1:25:42] demololtv: nothing they just break free
[1:25:47] nuclearphosphate: cant stand mob films
[1:26:19] thunduz: tneTrundleMaldini esqueeze me?!
[1:26:28] SlithTheSivak: we're like 5 years away from the average joe being able to use ai to make a full movie about whatever they want
[1:26:29] Demeternoth: I'm just of the mind now that you @nuclearphosphate don't like very many things XD
[1:26:40] S3N71: Now who's trolling, lol
[1:26:54] s7wede: He's 100% trolling
[1:27:01] nuclearphosphate: @Demeternoth oh i love a lot of things, spiderman films however, other than the first one are absolutely shite
[1:27:12] thunduz: I haven’t had enough coffee to break down my rage at that opinion
[1:27:23] nuclearphosphate: @physalis4 casino?
[1:27:45] mikeygames: me and my son love that channel
[1:27:54] Etaranel: So 5 years is my deadline for turning off my internet connection.
[1:28:08] MachoCham: Lets try a different tact. Madam Web or Ghost in the Shell
[1:28:26] nuclearphosphate: @MachoCham madam web, never heard of ghost in the shell
[1:28:50] SlithTheSivak: did he bring hello fresh?

[1:29:31] Big_Rum: Dan did you see Madem Web? Wondering if its any good...
[1:29:37] MachoCham: Doesn't look that cool. I've been in comfier travellodges
[1:29:57] nuclearphosphate: @Big_Rum its bloody brilliant
[1:29:58] physalis4: It's apparently oscar worthy
[1:29:59] s7wede: With what I've seen bears do to normal doors, there is no way I would trust that "bear proof" lock lol
[1:29:59] thunduz: seeing Madam web tonight
[1:30:01] S3N71: I removed it from my bucket list when he said bear proof lock
[1:30:03] Big_Rum: Im home sick today witha chest cold :(
[1:30:03] MediumRareOG: "I got eaten by a bear but at least I had my foot on the property ladder"

[1:30:56] Big_Rum: what is this minecraft
[1:31:09] SlithTheSivak: in door form?
[1:31:30] MachoCham: Can buy practically anything with enough money
[1:31:34] Sery_Bot: The ad break is finishing now! seryboLove
[1:31:42] MediumRareOG: There's a video of a guy who went out to Alaska because he believed he could befriend wild bears. Spoiler: he died
[1:31:57] KaisenSiru: Deadge
[1:32:15] SlithTheSivak: theres a guy who invented a bear proof suit...the testing for it is insane
[1:32:24] keyboardturner: I think I've seen that one
[1:32:24] s7wede: Yeah I saw this on X, it's not graphic
[1:32:33] s7wede: he pats the water, then swims over and is taken
[1:32:33] phurq1: What weapon does your hunter have?
[1:32:38] nuclearphosphate: @s7wede TWITTER
[1:32:38] StreamElements: dracJAM TWITCH PRIME dracJAM
[1:32:39] Etaranel: But was it the bear that killed him or the hope?
[1:32:52] MachoCham: Hope is where dreams go to die
[1:33:00] s7wede: There isn't anything you can do
[1:33:13] MediumRareOG: There are videos of Komodo dragons eating whole goats. The crazy thing is the goats don't resist or try and get away
[1:33:40] s7wede: It looks like it was gang related
[1:33:52] Catharsus: @MediumRareOG even if they did they would die, the saliva of those are nasty and then some
[1:33:53] MachoCham: Did he channel his inner Kelce?
[1:33:58] Etaranel: Jack Reacher?
[1:34:16] MachoCham: Yup
[1:34:19] Big_Rum: yeah
[1:34:27] Greatmatt1: Jesus Christ, that's Jason Bourne!
[1:34:30] Big_Rum: yup
[1:34:57] Big_Rum: end of the parade
[1:35:14] Haestoh: end of the parade. three shooters
[1:35:30] bmillybmilly: 1 dead and 22 shot
[1:35:30] s7wede: It was at the ned, and it looks like 3 guys from opposite teams, but also opposite gangs
[1:35:53] s7wede: it's suspected
[1:35:55] S3N71: Maybe time to take firearms off the menu at the 9/11
[1:36:10] mrsrockguru: A local DJ from a radio station died
[1:36:11] Haestoh: 2 shooters were suspected gang related. the third was unreleased to the first 2
[1:36:12] s7wede: the police haven't released a statement
[1:36:31] HaloS23: @S3N71 Dont start plz
[1:36:33] Haestoh: unrelated*
[1:36:57] S3N71: @S3N71 Just saying....
[1:37:18] MediumRareOG: there were 656 mass shootings in the US last year. It is quite literally a daily occurrence
[1:37:19] s7wede: The gun argument is far too complex for twitch chat
[1:37:33] S3N71: Okay,  I apologise.  Line drawn
[1:37:52] s7wede: Lol they got stopped at the border
[1:38:05] skewlbeta: I finished season 5 of better call saul. No spoilers for season 6 but omggggg some of that was the most intense tv I've ever seen
[1:38:10] Volryn: yea ou cant do that
[1:38:11] SlithTheSivak: that guys missing some brain cells
[1:38:24] keyboardturner: Okayge what did he think would happen
[1:38:25] skewlbeta: woopsie XD
[1:38:31] xIGBClutchIx: Dude has google at his finger tips
[1:38:35] Catharsus: see the lady that got onto a flight in nashville and ONTO the plane all the way to vegas? without a ticket :P
[1:38:51] MediumRareOG: He should know better. A Canadian woman in Vancouver accidentally ran too far into the park and entered the US. She was detained for 2 weeks
[1:39:01] Haestoh: The dudes who tackled the active shooter deserve an award
[1:39:15] apollymae: that doesnt happen in the uk? its legal to swim from france to england and just walk into the country?
[1:39:24] s7wede: Not in the North
[1:39:29] angelo_solaris: run into  a slight issue
[1:39:29] SlithTheSivak: its not like there are gunmen every 10 feet
[1:39:41] apollymae: no its not
[1:39:43] s7wede: The South has lots of walls, and checkpoints but the North is mostly wilderness
[1:39:50] skewlbeta: naw, the US border is massive, especially along canada. It's just fields and fields or mountains
[1:39:51] MediumRareOG: the border to Canada is like 5000km long. It's mostly just a 50ft line where they cut down the trees
[1:40:20] SlithTheSivak: so for instance in WA state, there is a ski resort where you can accidentally cross into Canada. if you do, you will be visited by guys on snowmobiles who were tracking ur every movement.
[1:40:21] DevoidX: only in the Schengen area
[1:40:30] skewlbeta: I have a huge family and one time my dad got pulled over for speeding in northern montana and a border patrol agent came up on the other side of the big white van he was driving to block anyone who would try to run. It was nuts.
[1:40:45] MediumRareOG: In Vancouver there's a park with a monument up saying "this it he border"
[1:40:52] Calicice12: What about the border between Ireland and N. Ireland?
[1:40:56] MediumRareOG: There are towns where one side of the street is CAnada and the other is the US
[1:41:13] skewlbeta: WA = washington state, 2 north of California
[1:41:41] apollymae: in some places
[1:41:46] Haestoh: We need a fortified border to wales Kappa
[1:41:53] DevoidX: yes, thats part of the good friday agreement
[1:41:54] S3N71: When I worked in Germany, I had to carry ID all the time, and produce it if required, so maybe that's why we could pass from country to country.  In the UK, you don't even have to carry you driving licence, you can turn up at a police station within 7 days and show it
[1:42:07] Calicice12: thats cool
[1:42:09] angelo_solaris: i can look it up if you want
[1:42:11] Etaranel: NI and Ireland is monitored by CCTV
[1:42:13] keyboardturner: i feel like if a park area is in a country then that land should extend over the border but i bet that's some kind of political hell
[1:42:49] angelo_solaris: i think most major docks have boarder agents
[1:43:00] Haestoh: sounds like a MaxFosh YouTube video idea
[1:43:58] SlithTheSivak: harbor master will check ur boats tags...
[1:44:23] Etaranel: You have to check in with the harbour master
[1:44:36] Lausten: Hes such a baddie
[1:44:40] fumennen: the patrol the waters and when you arrive they just pick you up
[1:44:42] MediumRareOG: On a boat you're meant to clear immigrations and customs. You report in when you dock. If you don't, it's a crime
[1:44:47] RAF_Sean: My new modem just showed up!
[1:44:49] RAF_Sean: Big hype
[1:45:22] Lausten: He sneaks into a military convention with a fake name like baddie or something like that
[1:45:23] keyboardturner: KEKW
[1:45:42] MediumRareOG: Just faster wifi, that's all
[1:45:42] keyboardturner: secret government communicators to collect your data
[1:45:53] Lausten: International Baddie is the name hes using lol
[1:45:54] SlithTheSivak: if u have fiber u need a different modem
[1:46:15] RAF_Sean: They will tell you they have a stronger signal and are more stable. If you're wired in though via ethernet (which you should be if you're gaming at a high level or streaming) then they do nothing differnent
[1:46:17] SlithTheSivak: like i get 1200 mbps dl speeds..
[1:46:18] DevoidX: they are modem/routers
[1:46:27] Catharsus: fiber doesnt need a modem usually
[1:46:27] Etaranel: Good news everybody! My motherboard bundle should arrive tomorrow!
[1:46:39] S3N71: Is it now like a flask?
[1:46:49] Manthieus: Spending that kinda $$ on wifi is madness... Say hello to my Ethernet cable...
[1:46:51] DevoidX: @Catharsus this is generally incorrect
[1:46:53] SlithTheSivak: whats ur dl speed dan?
[1:46:56] skewlbeta: TIL brits pronounce it rooter and not r-ow-ter
[1:47:28] gizzle1026: lolll
[1:47:58] Catharsus: @DevoidX not really,  i work in the tech field, fiber DOES require a router, but modems are not really used now days, specially for bigger companies, MAYBE a router/modem combo at best
[1:47:58] keyboardturner: root/route is also a differentiating pronunciation in america, heard some people call things a "root" instead of "route"
[1:48:08] RAF_Sean: Americans, am I right?
[1:48:13] Manthieus: hot take... Its called English for a reason
[1:48:19] S3N71: Cooking stream making bacon, lettuce and tomatoes when?
[1:48:19] Calicice12: Yes, because even within America we all pernouce everything the same .....
[1:48:31] keyboardturner: American English modCheck
[1:48:50] SlithTheSivak: routers were invented in massachusettes, so use their pronunciation?
[1:48:54] bwoods79: like aluminum

[1:49:32] S3N71: I understand Americans more than most Yorkshire citizens
[1:49:36] Lausten: Beeta House
[1:49:38] skewlbeta: my name is bay-ta if that helps XD
[1:49:43] Manthieus: That said, I recently learn even Geordies speak English
[1:49:49] DevoidX: @Catharsus fair enough. i'm in tech too and every boradband provider in the UK requires a modem. other countries may differ, of course
[1:49:57] magemaster225: tbf he says woman funny too
[1:50:00] SlithTheSivak: GIF
[1:50:01] MediumRareOG: speaking of betas, we haven't heard from andrew tate in awhile
[1:50:21] bwoods79: people still don't understand why you put a u in things that we don't.. like armour vs armor
[1:50:22] Big_Rum: Did you evger fix the statue behind you? Did you glue the pice backon?
[1:50:29] Catharsus: @DevoidX thats probably it, in the states only the non fiber ones require a modem now days
[1:50:32] Sery_Bot: The ad break is finishing now! seryboLove
[1:50:36] MediumRareOG: that channel 4 documentary was really good
[1:50:39] Big_Rum: Nice
[1:50:57] keyboardturner: french
[1:50:57] Big_Rum: You still thinktheres a chance we get alpha next month?
[1:51:24] s7wede: March is FULL
[1:51:25] bwoods79: Good trivia question: why is the keyboard laid out the way it is.
[1:51:40] MediumRareOG: The u's are historical. The US tried to "standardize " English spealling, did a completely half-assed job then gave up
[1:51:40] DevoidX: @Catharsus pretty much everything in uk is fibre now too. still require a modem.
[1:51:45] NeeK_23: mrgmHelloThere
[1:52:15] bwoods79: back in the day of typewriters they were typing too fast and the hammers got caught on each other, so they did it to slow down typists. if you want to type faster learn the dvorac keyboard
[1:52:28] NeeK_23: I'm late but did you see the Xmen Trailer??? Im more hyped than most Marvel shows in years
[1:52:29] shaypressplay: you would be annoyed with my Texas Southern Accent.
[1:52:30] MediumRareOG: The QWERTY keyboard is designed to slow down typing because otherwise people would jam manual typewriters
[1:52:30] Catharsus: @DevoidX a LOT here isnt now, i live in Chattanooga and we have some of the 'fastest' fiber in the world still, top 10 worldwide i think still, my base up and down is 300
[1:52:38] keyboardturner: same reason why people pronounce a bunch of made up WoW names in different ways
[1:52:54] skewlbeta: I thought I heard that southern accents in the US is most accurate to what old british accents sounded like in the 17/1800s
[1:52:57] PurplePixelsTV: the "U"s come from French borrowed words
[1:53:08] magemaster225: stenographer keyboards always throw me
[1:53:12] PurplePixelsTV: yes
[1:53:24] s7wede: American sounds closer to the old English from Shakespear and modern English is very much changed and influenced from French
[1:53:29] MediumRareOG: It's fair to say the French surrendered the u to English
[1:53:39] Catharsus: @skewlbeta unless you go to the mountains, then even us mountain foldk have issues understanding some of it ;)
[1:53:41] Lausten: English got quite a few of their words from Vikings
[1:53:43] bwoods79: Two advantages of the Dvorak keyboard are that more typing is done from the home row of the keyboard (70% vs. 30%) and fewer words are typed with just one hand.
[1:53:45] HaloS23: Doll vs Dal for Dalaran
[1:54:09] S3N71: We skip letter in Essex.  So it's not water, it's wa'er
[1:54:13] skewlbeta: @Catharsus Like the Appalachian accent? I grew up in central PA so I do have some of the ear for it
[1:54:36] Catharsus: @skewlbeta its THICK
[1:54:45] FranciscoTheMage: hello good morning @MrGM !!!
[1:54:47] keyboardturner: i think it is actually
[1:55:10] NeeK_23: people meme that Brits dont speak foreign languages but we're out here understanding Glaswegian, Geordie, Scouse, Brummie, Cockey and dozens more perfectly
[1:55:11] MediumRareOG: I don't think that's true. American English actually lost sounds that British English still has
[1:55:20] Goblocker: we will never really know what accents they had back then since we have no recordings....waiting for timetravelers on that on
[1:55:53] bwoods79: like..how did they know what dinosaurs sounded like?
[1:55:54] Big_Rum: wow I just watched the x-men 97 trailer ... looks fricken amazing
[1:56:03] FranciscoTheMage: does anyone know how i can block seeing a certain stream popping in my twitch home page
[1:56:06] MediumRareOG: A big one is the short o in "lost". Americans pronouncing "lost" sounds like "last"
[1:56:09] StreamElements: What to Expect from the War Within Pre-Patch - https://youtu.be/-E_BeclbeNY

[1:56:54] Volryn: @s7wede LUL
[1:57:18] ImperfectDark: i was getting these hot tub female streamer recommendations and i'm a gay man. Do better algorithming, Twitch
[1:57:20] NeeK_23: whats the giant red orb over his head?
[1:57:28] Manthieus: There is only so much Amouranth anyone needs to see
[1:57:33] Redivna: we want the drama LUL
[1:57:38] bwoods79: kind of like how you gets ads you don't want after going to certain sites..
[1:57:42] Manthieus: on this website anyway...
[1:58:24] FranciscoTheMage: i agree the whole hot tub nonsense is becoming overwhelmings
[1:58:27] Bware2: hello fresh for example - food ads everywhere :)
[1:58:31] S3N71: I cooked a roast lamp dinner for Sue last night, with all the trimmings, and she loved it.  I've been in the ktchen for the last 90 mins cleaning down and still not done!  Likfe was so much easier when I was chef and we had pot washes and kicthen porters
[1:58:40] survhunterdream: they are listening lmao
[1:58:40] Switzout: Do you use gmail?
[1:58:54] wildwittra: Big Brother listens in
[1:59:07] NeeK_23: you can turn those settings off, but then you get random ass adverts that make zero sense to you
[1:59:31] Volryn: Id rather ads that don't apply so I don't buy stuff
[1:59:33] illidari_Neeko: Hello Dan, hope your having a wonderful day 💕
[1:59:48] Catharsus: @S3N71 i made 2 12 ounce new york strips, baby red potatoes, green beans and brussel sprouts wrapped in bacons, the clean up was ROUGH lol <3
[1:59:54] suzyq1503: made beef bulgogi stir fry last night - lovely
[2:00:04] Volryn: Romance
[2:00:08] mikeygames: adblock/ublock ftw
[2:00:12] DevoidX: those who buy from ads make it worse for the rest of us!
[2:00:12] S3N71: It does, behind every great head chef and team of chefs, are better pot washers and kitchen porters
[2:00:29] bwoods79: awe i thought you were going to say baby #2 was on the way

[2:09:43] Layliah79: almost there!
[2:09:57] FranciscoTheMage: whats the new max level in this now?
[2:10:00] bojackhorseman2004: I ask again, was wondering if you have a different AD setup on your stream. I notice there are allot more ads. Like 5+ ads in a row
[2:10:19] keyboardturner: twitch might be doing that
[2:10:37] Dopefishy: !watchtime
[2:10:39] S3N71: PuGs are already clearing Gnomeregan, I've the buff at least one
[2:10:45] MachoCham: Basically Amazon needs more money
[2:10:54] keyboardturner: do ads proportionally give you a lot of money? (as opposed to subs / donations)
[2:10:58] mikeygames: these boxes are so costly to fill :(
[2:10:58] databob1: I still have a cold or flu.   I'm only half awake
[2:10:59] Dopefishy: I hardly ever get ads
[2:11:06] bojackhorseman2004: Ok, becuse most streams its usually. You watch adds when you enter the stream. But your that dosnt happen but instead you get 5 ads in a row after a certian time
[2:11:07] Dopefishy: once a week or something maybe or less
[2:11:17] bojackhorseman2004: But maybe its just a "feel" thing and 5 ads in a row feels worse but its the same time
[2:11:23] NeeK_23: @MachoCham Jeff is struggling, there's a cost of living crisis
[2:11:25] MachoCham: Prerolls are the devil
[2:11:31] CloudyHS: @keyboardturner Stare
[2:11:42] keyboardturner: Stare
[2:11:42] CloudyHS: wuz good dog
[2:11:43] snagprophet: did they find out if that ad accelerator on youtube gives creators the revenue because the ad was technically played?
[2:11:50] Lausten: What are ads? #Turbo
[2:12:02] NeeK_23: NeeK_23 gifted a Tier 1 sub to bojackhorseman2004! They have given 22 Gift Subs in the channel! 
[2:12:05] Redivna: ads are the devil period
[2:12:11] bojackhorseman2004: ah shiet xD
[2:12:13] KaisenSiru: Pog
[2:12:15] NeeK_23: fixed
[2:12:21] bojackhorseman2004: Thanks niko
[2:12:21] FranciscoTheMage: its also quite awful what amazon did to the prime video offer .. now you have pay 2.99 to watch shows uninterrupted
[2:12:28] keyboardturner: @snagprophet i love that people keep finding creative ways to bypass ads
[2:12:41] Manthieus: Most affiliates run 3min, partners is often higher.
[2:12:52] SlithTheSivak: adblockers can block amazon ads
[2:12:58] Manthieus: but #Turbolife
[2:13:10] MachoCham: Everyone is just spoilt. BACK IN MY DAY we had to watch ads on live tv every 15min
[2:13:13] mrsrockguru: yep ads and £2.99 a month to remove them
[2:13:19] snagprophet: @snagprophet its like an arms race, but this one was so unique compared to  changing the block coding
[2:13:27] keyboardturner: @MachoCham that's exactly why i don't watch TV KEKW
[2:13:31] MediumRareOG: 8 minutes is crazy ad density
[2:13:35] bojackhorseman2004: I heard twitch has been in the negative revenue wise just to get a monopoly, and it might get worse in the future
[2:14:09] keyboardturner: i hear that with youtube all the time too
[2:14:18] FranciscoTheMage: i can rationalize or understand ads on twitch since its literally free
[2:14:22] bwoods79: when ads come i just use it as a reminder to get up from the computer and go do something ex: get a coffee
[2:14:24] bojackhorseman2004: The thing they tried to limit third party AD deals might been that to
[2:14:27] FranciscoTheMage: but the prime video is just obnoxious
[2:14:33] snagprophet: it doesnt need to be profitable if there's enough money going into it from Amazon, because people clearly want streaming to keep going
[2:15:20] S3N71: Am I correct that if you buy Twitch Turbo, the streamer still get's the revenue from the add that you didn't sit through?
[2:15:32] s7wede: She got that 10k USD donation to go on a cruise
[2:15:41] FranciscoTheMage: what site is that?
[2:15:54] keyboardturner: strimer pls marry me if i pay you 10k
[2:15:58] FranciscoTheMage: the psychology is money laundering
[2:16:00] snagprophet: not to them tbh
[2:16:02] FranciscoTheMage: thats all
[2:16:08] s7wede: It's most like from somebody in the ME
[2:16:16] s7wede: that is Oil Money with no shits given
[2:16:17] MachoCham: It's comparative. 10k to a oil baron is nothing
[2:16:23] MediumRareOG: A lot of large donations to female streamers are charged back. They do it for attention. It's sad
[2:16:37] snagprophet: it would be pretty 5Head if people were donating to themselves in order to get the ball rolling and for attention
[2:16:48] s7wede: It depends
[2:16:53] bwoods79: I sometimes wonder if they are on an "alt" donating to themselves to get attention or to get subs/donations rolling
[2:17:16] s7wede: Paypal changed their services a while back to make it harder for bank chargebacks without a reason
[2:17:22] Lausten: :O
[2:17:23] snagprophet: Pog
[2:17:25] keyboardturner: they do it to a lot of people (as in not just streamers) happens with artists a lot with paypal and a lot of people refuse to do commissions with certain services because of it now
[2:17:27] bojackhorseman2004: @colli ur the best bro
[2:17:31] MediumRareOG: Years ago, Pokimane limited her donations to $5 max because of the problems it caused with people expecting attention. The crazy thing is she got hate for that
[2:17:31] keyboardturner: modCheck
[2:17:33] bojackhorseman2004: @kathryne omg wtf?
[2:17:35] physalis4: so couldn't she have done that
[2:17:38] Minobard: Legend
[2:17:43] snagprophet: lets vip Katheryne

[2:39:00] S3N71: I remember installing RedHat on an old laptop, that was past it's sale by date, and could no longer run the current WIndows, and it wasn't too bad
[2:39:05] MachoCham: Madam Web is our new meme
[2:39:15] keyboardturner: linux is... uh... idk how to put it. it has potential to be great, it works for its uses, but holy shit if you wanna just use anything simple without custom finagling it's annoying as hell
[2:39:17] snagprophet: people were saying it was worse than Morbius
[2:39:37] MachoCham: @keyboardturner Sounds like Android
[2:39:42] FranciscoTheMage: is it a marvel thing or what
[2:39:43] MachoCham: Kappa

[2:39:53] keyboardturner: it is
[2:40:01] MediumRareOG: Android is Linux
[2:40:02] physalis4: @FranciscoTheMage Sony based of Marvel stuff
[2:40:05] snagprophet: was funny when the interviewers were saying to Dakota Johnson "you're gonna have loads more movies from this now"
[2:40:10] keyboardturner: is worth noting linux OSs are like... super varied
[2:40:12] bwoods79: best thing about linux is it actually knows how to free up resources unlike windows...never need to reboot
[2:40:20] wildwittra: Linux kernel is in almost everything

[2:41:22] keyboardturner: @MachoCham pretty much this
[2:41:23] thunduz: Morbius started out good
[2:41:27] NeeK_23: did you see her try and name the Spiderman films? the sheer amount of not giving a fuck is impressive
[2:41:47] FranciscoTheMage: i wonder if batgirl will ever make it out to the pirate sites or did WB Just burn all of it
[2:41:55] physalis4: run something through pie? sounds messy
[2:42:06] MachoCham: Alright Rock
[2:42:16] keyboardturner: never used one but it looks like debian which is linux
[2:42:20] s7wede: It's locked in an actual vault
[2:42:23] FranciscoTheMage: yeah they made it
[2:42:28] FranciscoTheMage: and were about to release
[2:42:34] NeeK_23: it was very bad
[2:42:35] thunduz: they made it and locked it away
[2:42:48] FranciscoTheMage: it was apparently really bad.. the new owners killed it
[2:42:50] keyboardturner: wow tools local has a release for linux tho you should be able to run it off that I assume
[2:43:01] mrsrockguru: Film
[2:43:05] thunduz: was a film
[2:43:09] physalis4: you know it's bad if HBO won't even stream it
[2:43:11] s7wede: I think it's madam web bad, but they realized what it would do to the franchise
[2:43:29] thunduz: yep
[2:43:29] FranciscoTheMage: yes it was a huge thing
[2:43:35] MachoCham: It has to be some level of bad to say "fuck it" to $90m
[2:43:45] FranciscoTheMage: the directors and workers on the film were Highly upset
[2:43:49] NeeK_23: last year or so
[2:43:55] thunduz: Brenden Frazier was going to be the villain
[2:44:19] MachoCham: If a film is produced and recorded but never released does it exist in the universe? monkaHmm
[2:44:42] NeeK_23: release the Snyder cut of Batgirl LuL
[2:45:15] FranciscoTheMage: the people who worked on the film say its has been given a bad wrap.. but the new owners of WB hated it
[2:46:06] Goblocker: WB wants to completely delete the from so NO ONE can ever see it.
[2:46:17] MachoCham: I mean it has to be bad to hurt the DC Brand
[2:46:37] NeeK_23: ah yes the DCEU containing such quality as the Flash
[2:46:46] FranciscoTheMage: thats why i wonder if it will ever see the pirate sites. cause the owners NEVER ever want anyone to see it lol
[2:46:49] ImperfectDark: if they're worried about huring the DC brand, why release all those others DC movies lol
[2:47:09] FranciscoTheMage: IKR !!! @ImperfectDark
[2:47:12] keyboardturner: the tax writeoff thing is immensely stupid
[2:48:10] MachoCham: Irony is if they do release it then it would make more money from the intrigue from how bad it is
[2:48:47] ImperfectDark: dc animated movies though, are great
[2:48:49] FranciscoTheMage: HAHA!!! you're totally right @MachoCham

[2:54:32] Demeternoth: we have peregrin falcons here, they regularly catch pigeons
[2:54:40] keyboardturner: my dog is too big for any animal to want to fuck with it thankfully

[2:56:57] keyboardturner: ravens are much larger
[2:56:57] Volryn: Size is way diff
[2:57:05] Iwony: same family but not the sam
[2:57:06] MachoCham: Crow was Sting, Raven was ECW
[2:57:06] S3N71: I'm off to London tomorrow.  Forbidden Planet, Borough Market, and a stroll along the south bank to sample the street food and ale

[2:57:13] magemaster225: crows are like pidgeon/dove sized
[2:57:15] SlithTheSivak: they're super smart
[2:57:27] CrowMomocle: They are in the same family of Corvids
[2:57:29] uglukz: the shape of their tail is easiest way to tell when they fly
[2:57:37] Harper_n7: Oh, do ALL black birds look the same to you?! In THIS month??? /s
[2:57:39] bwoods79: Ravens are as big as Red-tailed Hawks, and crows are about the size of pigeons. The raven is all black, has a 3.5-4 ft wingspan and is around 24-27 inches from head to tail. The crow is also black, has a 2.5 ft wingspan and is about 17 inches long.
[2:57:46] CrowMomocle: they sound different too
[2:57:56] Goblocker: they remember humans who wronged them and get other crows to help them attack humans
[2:58:10] keyboardturner: i liked the ravens that lived nearby when i lived in alaska, they kind of learn who you are and judge if you're friendly or not
[2:58:14] CrowMomocle: Rooks and Jackdaws and Bluejays etc are also in the Crow family
[2:58:16] Iwony: at the tower?
[2:58:20] SlithTheSivak: there are a ton of ravens around the tower
[2:58:21] CrowMomocle: Tower has Ravens

[2:58:44] Iwony: they have a MAster of Ravens!
[2:58:46] Harper_n7: both ravens and crows are incredibly smart
[2:58:48] MediumRareOG: Ravens (and crows) are extremely intelligent
[2:58:58] SlithTheSivak: i got to feed them frozen peas, they were very courteous
[2:59:00] Harper_n7: There's countries training crows to pick up cigarette butts and trash
[2:59:07] Iwony: all Corvid are little genius'
[2:59:29] S3N71: There's a prophecy, if the ravens leave London, Shadowlands will be added to Chromie time.  Or we're all fucked.  Same thing
[2:59:33] CrowMomocle: @Iwony evilfmTHIS
[2:59:38] Sleepyjoegaming: my man what lvl are we
[2:59:43] keyboardturner: that raven face being held KEKW
[2:59:45] zantos2020: I tried to train my dog to pick up trash but she never figured it out
[2:59:58] SlithTheSivak: u also have swarms of parakeets in london that have been there a while
[3:00:02] S3N71: Man, we're all fucked, lol
[3:00:21] Sleepyjoegaming: getting there ! wahhooo
[3:00:23] MediumRareOG: there's a guy who has trained wild crows to bring him money for food
[3:00:33] s7wede: Leveling is the best part of shadowlands
[3:00:37] Iwony: leveling was not bad just the grind
[3:00:39] Sleepyjoegaming: whattt the maw was horrific
[3:00:39] Demeternoth: SL levelling was good!
[3:00:40] bwoods79: I like the story of this guy in NYC that trained crows to bring back coins in exchange for food, he made a ton
[3:00:48] keyboardturner: not many levelling experiences are that bad, it's just that we had to do the same route so many times over and over again
[3:00:51] FranciscoTheMage: it is for those of us who leveled in it at release
[3:00:51] s7wede: the covenant storyline makes it very fast
[3:00:54] MediumRareOG: SL levelling experience is awful
[3:00:56] zantos2020: SL isn't bad if you stay away from the storyline. I only do the world quests there
[3:00:57] snagprophet: i guess it gets a bit samey though when its four zones
[3:00:58] S3N71: It was okay....  I prefered BfA
[3:00:59] FranciscoTheMage: its good for new
[3:01:09] snagprophet: i imagine on alt number 5 I'll be bored of The War Within
[3:01:21] ImperfectDark: of March? Paddy's day
[3:01:47] ImperfectDark: City Centre will be absolutely packed
[3:01:49] SlithTheSivak: ireland has a reputation for a reason
[3:01:53] ImperfectDark: especially if you're hanging around Temple Bar
[3:01:54] CrowMomocle: no
[3:01:54] snagprophet: I mean they have stuff happening but its not like the river is being polluted etc
[3:01:59] S3N71: 17th March, Essex beats New York in to the ground
[3:02:06] snagprophet: typical pub session etc
[3:02:07] CrowMomocle: they don't need to they know they're Irish
[3:02:13] zantos2020: Americans will celebrate any holiday that involves booze, doesn't matter what it celebrates
[3:02:39] StreamElements: dracJAM TWITCH PRIME dracJAM
[3:02:39] S3N71: We love our Guinness, and we love our buy drink pints (normal for Essex) to get a big green hat
[3:02:41] snagprophet: is that auctionator?
[3:02:44] keyboardturner: bait
[3:03:18] zantos2020: I actually have yet to try Guinness
[3:03:20] ImperfectDark: are you staying with your mate cos hotels will be extortionate that weekend
[3:03:37] bwoods79: the more you look at it the cookies know and raise your price
[3:03:51] azhag25: make sure you're searching in incognito mode, those f'ers put the price up based up how many times you've searched!
[3:03:55] nash25pl: just leg it !
[3:04:31] snagprophet: nah we should keep the railways privatised
[3:04:51] snagprophet: particularly when its owned by foreign state owned companies
[3:05:52] mrsrockguru: If you want to go from south wales to north wales by train, it takes 7hrs
[3:05:57] S3N71: In Essex at the moment, you can go anywhere on an Arriva bus for £2.  So a trip to the cost for £4
[3:06:11] Harper_n7: Damn, so Hogwarts actively chooses to make parents spend extra for their kids to get there..
[3:06:18] MediumRareOG: Blame Thatcher and every PM since for why the trains are so expensive
[3:06:40] s7wede: An Oyster pass is fucking expensive
[3:07:03] S3N71: I like that it's cheaper still on the underground that you can use your debit card as an Oyster card
[3:07:11] Harper_n7: I live in the middle of the US. Flights and trains are stupid expensive for me... @ why Midwesterners just drive everywhere, no matter the distance
[3:07:24] mrsrockguru: Nope it goes way back to when they destroyed a huge amount of smaller train lines back in the 1960's
[3:07:40] MediumRareOG: Basically they privatized the trains (eg Southwest, GNER) and thus trains are expensive for profit
[3:08:04] bojackhorseman2004: its like that story of those two girls who lived in the UK who both flew to spain to meet up becuse traveling inside the uk to eachother would be more expensive
[3:08:36] keyboardturner: sounds like the UK is learning from america
[3:08:43] bwoods79: did those 2 girls share 1 cup?
[3:08:44] MediumRareOG: When I lived in the UK I rarely went outside London or I flew internationally
[3:09:02] SlithTheSivak: ban!

[3:09:13] s7wede: Things like meatspin or Goatse
[3:09:19] MediumRareOG: that's a ban or a week off at least
[3:09:29] S3N71: Once seen, never unseen :*(
[3:09:49] bojackhorseman2004: Taneshia Deckon, 27, from North London, flew to Mallorca and back in a day for just £30 via EasyJet and Wizz Air
[3:10:06] SlithTheSivak: blue. waffle.
[3:10:17] volkreig: going to visit my brother next week, £30 return train ticket to Birmingham
[3:10:18] SlithTheSivak: that took a while for mods to approve even w the punctuation
[3:10:24] snagprophet: kids in a sandbox monkaS
[3:10:38] volkreig: south east wales
[3:11:39] bojackhorseman2004: @MrGM what do you think is the 10.2.6 patch? like the pirate flag one
[3:11:52] keyboardturner: pirates
[3:11:53] MediumRareOG: The trains in Switzerland are awesome
[3:11:58] Harper_n7: My one way flight for 45 minutes from the city near me to another is minimum $150 :( I make the 4 hour drive instead every time
[3:12:12] bojackhorseman2004: The pirate flag might be a bait thou
[3:12:13] s7wede: I'm hoping exactly 1 week after the Hearthstone promo
[3:12:25] bojackhorseman2004: they said its gonna be for both classic and retail
[3:12:37] Harper_n7: yeah but a 45 minute flight would be nicer haha
[3:12:43] S3N71: I went to Southampton last year to visit my eldest daughter, with a one night stop over in Amazingstoke with a friend, and bought a railcard which paid for itself on the day and saved me a fortune.  The tickets did not leave me much change out of £200
[3:13:02] keyboardturner: if it were for classic I'd think it would be listed on the classic roadmap
[3:13:03] Harper_n7: My flight to New York is like $250 minimum every time :/
[3:13:09] S3N71: Mind you, I did buy them the night before
[3:14:12] S3N71: I think if you buy tickets 5 weeks or greater in advance, you can get super saver fares which aren't too bad
[3:14:29] Vedney: Why does SoD get dual wielding hunters and 2h Shamans, while retail doesnt
[3:14:52] bojackhorseman2004: Retail has allot more and different class variety
[3:15:04] bojackhorseman2004: classic has mostly cooki cutter builds
[3:15:10] Harper_n7: I went to the F1 race in Austin, TX last year and I met a friend from Dublin and a friend from Birmingham there and their flights were almost the same price as mine...
[3:15:21] keyboardturner: classic hunters can also use melee and ranged weapons simultaneously but retail can't
[3:15:25] S3N71: I think classic had dual wield at 30 in vanilla, was a way to stack AGL
[3:15:28] MediumRareOG: i still don't get why they got rid of the ranged slot
[3:15:41] S3N71: May have been 40
[3:16:01] MediumRareOG: Like I liked wands
[3:16:16] S3N71: Ah nice, I passed that milestone and didn't realise
[3:16:41] MediumRareOG: wands are just stat sticks like any other weapon now
[3:16:51] CrowMomocle: definitely use my want in SoD on mage, priest and warlock when run low on mana
[3:16:54] keyboardturner: maybe, it's immensely more inviting i think
[3:17:00] bojackhorseman2004: Level 60 is gonna be insane, i hope they re release all the raids in different ways
[3:17:17] CrowMomocle: Wand*
[3:17:17] moriartiphd: here's another question.  will they make sod tbc?
[3:17:29] S3N71: I've been enjoying SoD, going to miss my chars when they turn the servers off
[3:17:31] MediumRareOG: I don't think SoD 60s will exceed classic
[3:17:57] bojackhorseman2004: or! make it SoD goes to level 55 which is where you do molten core than a later patch is you go to level 58 when you do ahanqirac and so on
[3:18:01] bojackhorseman2004: and 60 is naxramas
[3:18:31] moriartiphd: after 80% of active 60s have done naxx
[3:18:55] steveez: 10 man <3
[3:18:57] FranciscoTheMage: a new ubrs
[3:18:59] bojackhorseman2004: But dont the talents cause power creep? so being 60 with SoD stuff be to OP?
[3:19:01] MediumRareOG: SoD M+ LULW
[3:19:04] snagprophet: or something like UBRS with ten men inside
[3:19:05] bojackhorseman2004: which is why i think we can be underleveled for the max level raids
[3:19:37] bojackhorseman2004: or! you do the 40 man raids as a 20 man group???
[3:19:41] bojackhorseman2004: that be POG
[3:19:47] bojackhorseman2004: they rebalance them
[3:19:47] S3N71: My Silverwing Sentinels bow is still pre-raid BiS at Level 40
[3:19:56] bojackhorseman2004: and it fix so many issues!
[3:20:02] moriartiphd: they could m+ type system for dungeons
[3:20:08] bojackhorseman2004: somone call holly with this 200IQ idea
[3:20:12] Mrn0mzz: What addon are you using to display the quests like that :O
[3:20:14] FranciscoTheMage: NO
[3:20:17] FranciscoTheMage: god
[3:20:22] moriartiphd: with some buffs for gear
[3:20:30] FranciscoTheMage: why people want to bring that nonsense into classic

[3:21:30] MediumRareOG: What SoD needs is Torghast
[3:21:34] bojackhorseman2004: Classic is great exactly becuse you dont feel like you have to rush
[3:22:00] bojackhorseman2004: SoD isnt classic+?
[3:22:07] MediumRareOG: I get bored in Classic once I hit 60

[3:27:46] winsko_: With WF on druids and kings on hunter there wont be alliance shamans/ horde pallies
[3:27:51] S3N71: I'd like to see more 'what if' scenarios.  P1 gave us Warlock Tanks, Mage Healers, P2 just seemed less explorative in terms of fun combos
[3:28:30] S3N71: Melee hunter is a thing
[3:28:54] winsko_: melee hunter is top dps at the moment, but will get nerfed surely

[3:30:04] winsko_: I think its 20%?

[3:34:48] Thoreya: summoning

[3:35:57] SlithTheSivak: leftover banoffee pie
[3:36:19] Victoriank: No i like that too
[3:36:34] kaijoe_: Honey on an english muffin. Unmatched.
[3:36:48] bwoods79: I love how honey is like the only thing that never expires
[3:36:49] SlithTheSivak: manuka honey has a flavor thats a bit aquired
[3:39:27] bwoods79: do you think they will take the SoD into bc?
[3:39:59] BBMezzy: Which is ironic considering 10.2.5 came out 1 month ago
[3:40:30] winsko_: they already added some new "zones" in P2, I think they will continue that way
[3:40:33] BBMezzy: 10.2.5 was buggy fluff
[3:40:51] Minobard: Fuggy Bluff
[3:41:20] Minobard: 10.2.6 Pirate Warfront Confirmed
[3:41:45] BBMezzy: Well it must have the BfA raid solo changes and if it does then it might have BfA timewalking
[3:42:00] Minobard: but you have to take your fleet from your WOD garrison to power up your azerite necklace
[3:42:32] Minobard: it will grant you reknown with your pirate convenant
[3:42:51] physalis4: I just want something interesting to do that isn't Azeroth Archives
[3:43:25] Minobard: i liked pvp islands in bfa (minority i know) - pvp delves would be sick
[3:43:42] S3N71: Yarr Pirates
[3:45:23] Minobard: 10.2.6 bring back strand of the ancients
[3:45:40] S3N71: I've seen players with some sweet weapons from the PvP event, and I know parties are allowed, raids are not
[3:46:26] Minobard: have you found any of the new hunter glyphs (i dont play sod, might not be what they are called)
[3:46:27] S3N71: PvP with viewers stream :)
[3:47:26] PrewtaEU: the ruens in ph2 is not naturally happening, though
[3:47:41] retentiontime: sorry, since I have slept the entire 2023, was CLASSIC WOLTK big time overhyper?
[3:47:51] S3N71: There's one that starts in Desolace, the throw trap one
[3:47:52] PrewtaEU: the spellbook in SM graveyard
[3:48:00] PrewtaEU: but runes are outdoorws
[3:48:26] snagprophet: how long does the auctionator full scan normally take? its a greyed out button that says start scanning but im told this is its scanning appearance
[3:48:34] PrewtaEU: you NEED the trap launcher. you can use your traps like in retail. launch them and use them in combat
[3:48:43] S3N71: There goes your gold :(

[3:49:27] ZombieBrigade: what addo is showing quest items on map ?
[3:49:27] bwoods79: If they really wanted people to play SoD they should have made that super rare green mount from gnomer get added to your retail collection
[3:49:34] ZombieBrigade: i use zygor and dont see them
[3:49:44] PrewtaEU: the trap launcher is from all over the world and i doubt very many will solo it. i did in a riad at lvl 26.
[3:50:03] S3N71: Righto, I'll grab Zygor another stream, out for dinner with Sue tonight, so gonna hit the bathroom and get beautiful
[3:50:50] PrewtaEU: oh no. the trap launcehr was the easier one maybe. could be the melee specialist was the one that was harder.
[3:51:09] bwoods79: What is the shirt you are wearing today? I'm used to disney or some other toon theme
[3:51:19] Big_Rum: is balance or feral a better dps spec?
[3:51:35] Big_Rum: in retail
[3:51:50] PrewtaEU: the drops from the dark iron dwarfs are pretty cheap on the AH now.
[3:52:34] MediumRareOG: No, that was smart to sell the dark iron ordinance in phase 1
[3:52:49] volkreig: You going to try to get into a SM run?
[3:52:51] PrewtaEU: it's the shredder things that cost more. the stuff for the lone wolf went up a bit since they doubled the effect of it for ph2.

[4:04:30] Knight_Of_Sarcasm: Hello!
[4:04:34] retentiontime: very nice
[4:04:41] Iwony: Did you know that the Worgen Top Hat stays on the head of a WorgenDruid when they transform? Not sure about other races... but my moony wears a Top Hat in retail and I love it.
[4:04:48] chelfx: Hardcore?
[4:05:09] FranciscoTheMage: permadeath mode .. ya hardcore i guess is what it called
[4:05:22] Iwony: it is really cute
[4:05:36] Iwony: I can make a screeny
[4:06:03] Iwony: need to check
[4:06:20] Knight_Of_Sarcasm: Looking forward to that image! Worgens are amazing. :)
[4:06:21] Iwony: Gilnean Noble Top Hat
[4:06:26] FranciscoTheMage: so what happened to the hardcore servers or characters
[4:06:31] chelfx: chelfx subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 14 months, currently on a 8 month streak! mrgmHelloThere
[4:06:39] FranciscoTheMage: thats what i dont understand about classic. theres no continuity it seems
[4:07:05] Knight_Of_Sarcasm: Hardcore is there.
[4:07:18] Knight_Of_Sarcasm: I avoid it.
[4:07:26] chelfx: Its just another thing you can play
[4:07:34] Knight_Of_Sarcasm: I die quickly.
[4:07:40] bojackhorseman2004: @MrGM did you hear about steve from wow team for tifred/quit?
[4:07:47] mikeygames: you reckon phase 3 raid Dan will be sunken temple? then phase 4 be karazhan crypts?
[4:07:50] bojackhorseman2004: the previous lead story dude
[4:07:59] FranciscoTheMage: so its just that no one streams it
[4:08:02] FranciscoTheMage: ohhhh ok ok
[4:08:06] chelfx: They did
[4:08:10] bojackhorseman2004: is chris metzon taking hes place?
[4:08:23] FranciscoTheMage: seems like a lot of people were streaming hardcore at some point
[4:08:23] bojackhorseman2004: I havent really been happy with wow story in a long time, this might be really good
[4:08:24] chelfx: maybe SM is the 50 raid with Kara
[4:08:29] KirbyDLX: They said SM is just their aspirations for what could be
[4:08:38] Knight_Of_Sarcasm: Metzen, the man of many talents.
[4:09:05] bojackhorseman2004: The nr1 thing i love about metzen is that hes stated he wants to take us "back to azeroth"

[4:09:10] Akela3: @bojackhorseman2004 steve wasn't the only one responsible for the story. he wasn't fired and one guy leaving isn't going to singlehandedly fix all complaints you might have about the story.
[4:09:12] bojackhorseman2004: and the plants to return to qualthalas and northrend shows that
[4:09:30] Knight_Of_Sarcasm: Do you think in retail that they'll unlock the old Sunken Temple? It came up in dungeon run-guild voice chat last night.
[4:09:32] bojackhorseman2004: Yes...but i mean the original wow classic world
[4:09:37] keyboardturner: he's still living in shadowlands Sadge
[4:09:51] FranciscoTheMage: unlock?
[4:10:09] bojackhorseman2004: @Akela3 well, ofc but hes the lead story designer and overall story direction might been in hes hands
[4:10:29] Minobard: Bring back OG Sunken Temple - Put it in the Mythic pool - minobaRAGE
[4:10:33] Knight_Of_Sarcasm: I thought Sunken Temple was the same map just blocked off?
[4:11:09] StreamElements: What to Expect from the War Within Pre-Patch - https://youtu.be/-E_BeclbeNY
[4:11:12] mikeygames: old sunken temple was amazing
[4:11:25] Knight_Of_Sarcasm: LOL! Top hat!
[4:11:38] Iwony: I have no idea
[4:11:41] mikeygames: any news if they've figured out what's behind the laser walls in gnomeregan?
[4:11:49] SlithTheSivak: apparently the sailor moon outfits heart shows through druid forms too
[4:11:55] Iwony: I just used it as Transmog and it was there on Transform ^^
[4:12:03] Knight_Of_Sarcasm: Blinks...
[4:12:07] mikeygames: after the last boss, you get an item with a combination
[4:12:44] Knight_Of_Sarcasm: It wouldn't  be WoW w/o clipping
[4:12:52] mikeygames: Thermaplugg's Safe Combination on wowhead
[4:13:03] Minobard: This is my favorite part of wow - the pre ding anticipation
[4:13:31] mikeygames: saw it on reddit a few days ago
[4:14:13] Minobard: lol
[4:15:31] Dunkurk: They fixed them in BFA i want to say
[4:15:34] Dunkurk: also evening
[4:15:50] Knight_Of_Sarcasm: I think the hardest rep I have done with the Bloodsail.  Can't go to B-Bay now. Worth it.
[4:16:28] Knight_Of_Sarcasm: Took me an entire day, lol. :D
[4:16:45] Knight_Of_Sarcasm: Very.
[4:16:52] mrsrockguru: Nearly hit lvl 70, plowing through 69 via the elder's quests
[4:16:53] Knight_Of_Sarcasm: And since it's cross character Titles.
[4:17:02] Knight_Of_Sarcasm: I'd assume they're easier.
[4:17:15] Dunkurk: it's a lot of pirate slaughter in tanaris
[4:17:20] MediumRareOG: It takes 1-2 days of farming pirates in STV to get rep
[4:17:26] Knight_Of_Sarcasm: Might be a tabard. Who knows.
[4:17:39] MediumRareOG: sorry tanaris not STV
[4:17:43] mrsrockguru: Is 10.2.6 coming out after the Hearthstone event next monrth
[4:17:44] physalis4: mrgmDab
[4:18:31] mrsrockguru: We know its march but not when in march
[4:18:31] Knight_Of_Sarcasm: I wish but don't think will happen that if you have a rep with a non DF group (Legion?) that would Warmode to the other PCs.  Maybe then I'd get my shoes for all the classes' transmogs.
[4:18:34] Iwony: Ok I just tried the same Top Hat on my Tauren Moony and it is not there... it may be a Worgen only thing....
[4:19:00] physalis4: What if 10.2.6 isn’t announced and it just drops with no notice on a random, reset day
[4:19:23] Knight_Of_Sarcasm: Sorry, Player Characters.  And Warmode the upcoming cross-PCs thing.
[4:19:34] mrsrockguru: I'm hoping it drops for both on the same day 10.2.6
[4:19:38] Akela3: Warband?
[4:19:41] Knight_Of_Sarcasm: That's it!
[4:20:01] Knight_Of_Sarcasm: A gal can dream
[4:20:41] Knight_Of_Sarcasm: It was weird being places and it was bright as day 3am Eastern.
[4:21:07] mikeygames: #mindblown, you can't mount your mount in water
[4:21:24] Knight_Of_Sarcasm: They did this on purpose just to troll players.  (Chuckles, teasing WoW)
[4:21:33] mikeygames: yeah on SoD, I forgot entirely, core memory unlocked
[4:21:39] koalavacado: what are those unit frames name?
[4:21:51] keyboardturner: It's the NIGHTsquall Pog
[4:22:03] keyboardturner: 12 hours later it becomes the DAYsquall
[4:22:09] koalavacado: thank you
[4:22:16] Knight_Of_Sarcasm: Heh.
[4:22:28] Knight_Of_Sarcasm: Haven't heard of the Junkheap.  Where is that from Elk?

[4:25:06] Knight_Of_Sarcasm: The Butterfinger commercial was cute.
[4:25:34] physalis4: chocolate bar
[4:25:50] Knight_Of_Sarcasm: Tries to describe it.  Chocolate covered peanutbutter crisps.
[4:26:28] Knight_Of_Sarcasm: No, flat wafers
[4:26:35] Sery_Bot: The ad break is finishing now! seryboLove
[4:26:41] physalis4: Yeah it’s like candied peanut butter. hard not smooth
[4:26:43] CrowMomocle: the middle is like a buttery honeycomb
[4:26:50] Knight_Of_Sarcasm: Not all.
[4:26:56] ImperfectDark: i concur
[4:27:00] keyboardturner: D:
[4:27:01] CrowMomocle: was my mother's favourite
[4:27:01] Knight_Of_Sarcasm: Good way to describe it.
[4:27:25] Knight_Of_Sarcasm: It's one of the kid's favorites
[4:27:36] CrowMomocle: wax
[4:27:45] keyboardturner: Kappa
[4:27:45] Knight_Of_Sarcasm: Hershey's is a huge company here.
[4:27:50] ImperfectDark: there's a reason for the vomit like flavour lol
[4:27:52] SlithTheSivak: buteric acid, ya its not great
[4:28:11] physalis4: Hershey’s is probably the most famous and popular American chocolate bar
[4:28:11] keyboardturner: a lot of americans have gotten used to it so they don't taste it
[4:28:13] Knight_Of_Sarcasm: It used to be better but they swapped the ingredients
[4:28:18] SlithTheSivak: buteric acid is stomach acid and they use it to emulsify hersheys
[4:28:29] Knight_Of_Sarcasm: Do we need to make a care package?
[4:28:46] MissBirchBee: I live in the same state as Hershey so I feel like I should like it but I hate it so much
[4:29:03] keyboardturner: americans are superior because we can enjoy both EU chocolate and our own :^)

[4:29:41] apollymae: supposed to be chocolate adnd caramel
[4:29:49] CrowMomocle: we got it in the middle of lolly pops too called Tootsie Pops
[4:29:51] FranciscoTheMage: tootsie roll is chocolate flavored taffy. its not chocolate per se
[4:29:59] keyboardturner: Kappa
[4:30:06] skewlbeta: ngl I'm not really *enjoying* much american chocolate unless it's a little mom and pop shop
[4:30:08] CrowMomocle: Love Belgium choccie
[4:30:23] ImperfectDark: also, i think US Cadburys isn't the same as UK. They add that same puke flavour
[4:30:24] keyboardturner: our cereal is basically candy KEKW
[4:30:32] CrowMomocle: Captain Crunch
[4:30:34] SlithTheSivak: recees puffs are the best
[4:30:41] skewlbeta: cinnamon toast crunch is elite
[4:30:41] mikeygames: can get them in the UK Dan from b&m
[4:30:42] FranciscoTheMage: i saw a tik tok on how uk does baked potato. it was atrocious
[4:30:46] physalis4: Most US chocolate was invented by immigrants that came here from Europe, so whose fault is it really? LUL
[4:30:49] CrowMomocle: yeah you don't need milk, just snack on it dry
[4:30:51] skewlbeta: I do also like the frosted mini wheats
[4:31:00] keyboardturner: trix

[4:32:24] CrowMomocle: Horrifying all the sugar in all those cereals
[4:32:32] chelfx: did you watch the xman 97 trailer?

[4:32:49] mikeygames: how old is she now Dan?
[4:32:59] Knight_Of_Sarcasm: Biggest quality of life change from vanilla to retail is that quest things do not go in your bag now.
[4:33:11] mikeygames: that is going by so quick!
[4:33:35] Knight_Of_Sarcasm: No, no.  Please don't go there Elk.
[4:33:43] Knight_Of_Sarcasm: Phobia.
[4:34:55] chelfx: did someone say FREE?
[4:34:59] mikeygames: ask for a house recommendation ha
[4:35:43] survhunterdream: stream from a new car
[4:35:45] Knight_Of_Sarcasm: I like that streamers can say what goal they have for super chats or bits or whatever.  Then viewers can help get them to that goal.
[4:35:58] Knight_Of_Sarcasm: Like, I need a new camera.
[4:36:04] survhunterdream: a ferrari would make the stream quality better
[4:36:18] mikeygames: QR code on the meet up in London for donors
[4:36:23] Dunkurk: nah you tweet at elon not tesla 50/50 you get a car

[4:37:15] mikeygames: which keyboard is it?
[4:38:00] apollymae: let us know how quiet it is
[4:38:23] FranciscoTheMage: nvidia broadcasT?
[4:38:31] SubliminalsTTV: @MrGM do you think blizz should add a custom dye feature to xmog to change armor colors on existing sets?
[4:38:33] fooxytv: do they have a smaller designed keyboard without the numpad?
[4:38:59] FranciscoTheMage: what is that a program? or add-on to obs?
[4:39:18] SubliminalsTTV: like imagine the tomb of sargeras mythic paladin set except its black with red glowing lights
[4:39:33] FranciscoTheMage: ohhh nice its like obs?
[4:40:01] Dunkurk: Is that the AI thing? so your stream is powered by AI, youll be populour come machine rise up

[4:41:58] keyboardturner: how dare an adaptive algorithm do something, I don't like it therefore it is AI

[4:46:46] Lausten: Premade Groups UI is 10 times better than the Bulletin Board
[4:46:52] kfa2kfa: yeah
[4:47:07] FranciscoTheMage: i dont remember a bulletin board
[4:47:15] FranciscoTheMage: was that in classic?
[4:47:47] Lausten: Vanilla no, classic yeah

[4:48:23] kfa2kfa: or whats is it?

[4:49:32] Knight_Of_Sarcasm: I didn't know pre-made existed until two weeks ago.
[4:51:09] Knight_Of_Sarcasm: I liked doing dungeon runs last night--so many classic dungeons I hadn't done since pre-Cata and/or just hadn't ran at all.  And a Motherlode.
[4:51:40] Knight_Of_Sarcasm: The guildies are gentle on me.
[4:52:20] Dunkurk: RFD uldaman and SM cath
[4:52:40] Dunkurk: yeah the scarlet set is bis for enhace shamans pre raid
[4:52:48] Dunkurk: you can get the whrilwind axe at 30 if you try hard enough
[4:52:49] mikeygames: yes you can
[4:52:54] mikeygames: saw someone with it I'm sure
[4:53:41] Dunkurk: The charms where bugged for it at launch and wherent dropping so people where selling the ones they had from phase 1 for a fortune
[4:53:44] Knight_Of_Sarcasm: I know SP but not well.  Been over a year

[4:55:49] Lausten: I thought she was preparing for 10.2.6 and Nightsquall Kappa
[4:55:54] Dunkurk: sea of thieves is a mmo-light

[4:56:37] Sery_Bot: The ad break is finishing now! seryboLove
[4:56:42] Knight_Of_Sarcasm: I've been watching a friend with SoTs.
[4:57:00] Knight_Of_Sarcasm: It's hilarious.
[4:57:10] skewlbeta: I loved sea of thieves except for it making me motion sick lol
[4:57:19] Knight_Of_Sarcasm: I don't mind the ads if I can't sub.
[4:57:37] Knight_Of_Sarcasm: What sword?
[4:57:38] Lausten: #Turbo
[4:57:44] FranciscoTheMage: ads wouldn't be bad if streamers would pause content
[4:57:44] skewlbeta: I don't have problems with motion sickness otherwise. Just that game XD
[4:57:58] FranciscoTheMage: but streamers refuse to do that so its unbearable
[4:58:08] Sleepyjoegaming: sameee
[4:58:24] skewlbeta: mrgmKEKW
[4:58:33] MichaelLoda: I have a twitch adblock GIGACHAD
[4:58:38] Sleepyjoegaming: dont be like that hahha
[4:58:41] Sleepyjoegaming: no not yet
[4:58:49] Knight_Of_Sarcasm: Some of the smaller streamers take stretch breaks during ads.
[4:59:03] MichaelLoda: Well I'm not getting any ads so yeah it does
[4:59:03] Dunkurk: ublock works on twitch with a few tweaks
[4:59:23] MichaelLoda: Fuck ads, they should be outlawed
[4:59:35] FranciscoTheMage: what browser are you using michael
[4:59:40] Knight_Of_Sarcasm: Ads need to be there.
[4:59:44] MichaelLoda: They ruined the internet
[4:59:44] Knight_Of_Sarcasm: That exactly.
[4:59:54] keyboardturner: what's the alternative, are you gonna donate a premium sub to use baseline twitch
[5:00:03] FranciscoTheMage: i agree ads should be there but streamers need to adjust..
[5:00:04] Knight_Of_Sarcasm: YT I pay for Premium.
[5:00:19] FranciscoTheMage: its streamer behavior that is not adjusting
[5:00:23] Knight_Of_Sarcasm: The YT ads are HORRIBLE
[5:00:37] Lausten: I lived in Russia for 30 minutes and got YT Premium :D
[5:00:51] FranciscoTheMage: but YT ads Can be SKIPPED
[5:01:00] mikeygames: I live in Vietnam and get youtube premium family plan for £4 :D
[5:01:02] Lausten: I've had it for more than 2 years now, dont count on getting banned
[5:01:06] Dunkurk: at least youtubes past the worst of its ad days where you load up a 10 min video and theres a 30 min ad infront of it
[5:01:18] Knight_Of_Sarcasm: Your princess is in the other tower.
[5:02:05] Sleepyjoegaming: thinking about rolling a hunter for my alt is it a good choice?
[5:02:06] Knight_Of_Sarcasm: That's why I got frustrated, said, they got me and I can't take it anymore and just clicked "free trial" for premium.
[5:02:15] Lausten: Watch out for Bowser
[5:02:39] StreamElements: dracJAM TWITCH PRIME dracJAM
[5:03:02] Lausten: Its their countries economy thats collapsed not Blizzards fault
[5:03:04] chelfx: I mean Argentina has bigger problems to worry about atm
[5:03:52] Lausten: They got more problems than not being able to play a video game in Argentina at the momnet..
[5:03:53] keyboardturner: because they're converting the currency directly. people like botters abuse it by setting a VPN into argentina, using the super cheap conversion of bnet money to create boosted characters
[5:04:10] Knight_Of_Sarcasm: Can you share kills in SoD?
[5:04:27] Dunkurk: I wonder if they identifyed a lot of gold sellers in the region and thats what drove them to that decision, runescape had a problem where the entire economey of venuzuela was run by runescape gold sellers
[5:04:37] chelfx: "Argentina's annual inflation soars above 250% in January"
[5:04:41] keyboardturner: I hate it but it's really an argentina economy problem, not exactly Blizzard's
[5:05:01] Lausten: The country is bankrupt
[5:05:22] Dunkurk: J1mmy?
[5:05:35] mikeygames: you can even redeem Argentina xbox keys on your UK account etc, cheap as chips. Really is crazy the cost in various countries
[5:05:35] Sleepyjoegaming: whattt
[5:05:42] Sleepyjoegaming: what did you play before wow?
[5:05:48] Dunkurk: I highly highly recommend you play OSRS rather than modern
[5:06:06] Lausten: I remember playing it back in 2004 when I was on boarding school, only thing the computers could run LUL
[5:06:07] Sleepyjoegaming: play old school
[5:06:13] Sleepyjoegaming: not the new one its crap
[5:06:38] FranciscoTheMage: did you like it
[5:06:50] Dunkurk: I'd say wait for the next OSRS league to happen but if youve 0 experiance with RS your better to just boot up normal old school and play
[5:07:46] FranciscoTheMage: theres a new store in my town that does nothing but sell retro games and retro consoles
[5:07:59] FranciscoTheMage: they are really successful
[5:08:13] chelfx: alot to nothing
[5:08:23] chelfx: depending on the game and console
[5:08:27] Knight_Of_Sarcasm: Nice! We have a chain so I thought they were in other cities. "The Exchange."
[5:08:38] skewlbeta: surprise news would be very cool but I don't think so
[5:08:42] FranciscoTheMage: i think people are paying a premium and it makes it worth their while i suppose

[5:09:41] Knight_Of_Sarcasm: I vaguely remember a hunter back when; hunters today are much much easier.
[5:10:14] Knight_Of_Sarcasm: For the Exchange they buy from people and then sell to people after testing things.
[5:10:21] Dunkurk: Covid absolutly exploded the cost of retro games, N64 carts shot up in price even for the less rare ones
[5:10:28] Knight_Of_Sarcasm: Movies, CDs, games, etc
[5:10:56] Knight_Of_Sarcasm: Uno's ten dollars.
[5:11:04] Lausten: Book sales as well soared
[5:11:15] Dunkurk: oh yeah, I have a freind that made a board gamme back in 2018 it sold a few but not massive, then coivd happeend and it exploded
[5:11:18] skewlbeta: I've been chowing down on girl scout cookies because it's that season and just realized that you in the UK probably don't have them
[5:11:24] chelfx: There is a twitch stream DSKoopa he runs a retro game shop Pink Gorilla and he streams him self runing the store during the day and prepping new stock at night
[5:12:00] Knight_Of_Sarcasm: Girl Scout cookies?  They're 4.00 a box now but the money goes to the scouts.
[5:12:03] skewlbeta: yeah they have a bunch of different kinds and you can order.
[5:12:26] skewlbeta: @Knight_Of_Sarcasm $6 in my area. And only part of it goes to the actual troop, most of it goes to the council
[5:12:31] Lausten: So basically delivery by kids? Kappa
[5:12:32] Knight_Of_Sarcasm: Thin Mints are the most popular I think.  I freeze mine.
[5:12:58] Knight_Of_Sarcasm: Yes basically.
[5:13:10] skewlbeta: @Knight_Of_Sarcasm They are! I love tagalongs but so does my husband. And good news, they have sold shortbread cookies for decades.
[5:13:14] Knight_Of_Sarcasm: Or a table in front of a grocery store (as like the Addam's Family movie #1)
[5:13:16] Sleepyjoegaming: what about bourbons
[5:13:35] FranciscoTheMage: FranciscoTheMage subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 12 months! 
[5:13:36] Knight_Of_Sarcasm: I love the shortbread with tea
[5:13:37] Sleepyjoegaming: because your dads a smart man
[5:13:41] Dunkurk: Millionaires shortbread is decadence incarnate
[5:13:49] FranciscoTheMage: got to run @MrGM thanks for the stream
[5:14:00] Lausten: Talking about food, whats for dinner?
[5:14:00] skewlbeta: They also sell nuts and candy in the fall I think but that's much less popular. Almost like the boy scouts selling popcord.
[5:14:22] Knight_Of_Sarcasm: Sad.  We don't have that shortbread brand.
[5:14:24] chelfx: They dont make them
[5:14:30] Knight_Of_Sarcasm: No, they use a company supplier.
[5:14:33] mikeygames: cookies made from scouts
[5:14:35] chelfx: They just sell them
[5:14:52] skewlbeta: Back in the day yes, that's what happened. But nowadays it's little brownie bakers that make them, and the girls go door to door and post up in front of the grocery store to sell them
[5:15:01] Pilums: Kreygasm
[5:15:07] Dunkurk: You know whats better than shortbread and cookies
[5:15:09] Dunkurk: Tablet
[5:15:21] skewlbeta: My grandma did meet up with her troop in the like 1940s or whatever and baked them
[5:15:23] Dunkurk: Scottish Tablet
[5:15:50] Knight_Of_Sarcasm: I've helped a Girl Scout sell; I took an order for to school and got preorders
[5:15:50] Dunkurk: its like a solid lump of melt in your mouth sugary goodness
[5:15:59] ImperfectDark: Empire Biscuits. They're so fucking good
[5:16:09] Lausten: Mmmmmh fudge 🤤
[5:16:12] Dunkurk: right ill bring tablet to LFG
[5:16:41] chelfx: we have something in canada nanaimo bars and they are amazing
[5:16:47] Knight_Of_Sarcasm: There's a website now which surprised me.  My step daughter shared the link when her troop was selling.
[5:17:21] keyboardturner: they cut out the middleman: girl scouts
[5:17:22] Knight_Of_Sarcasm: Yes you have 4 ways to buy now.
[5:17:24] keyboardturner: now it's just cookies
[5:18:48] Knight_Of_Sarcasm: The website does give the cut to local troops.
[5:19:02] Knight_Of_Sarcasm: Girl Scout cookies only come around once a year
[5:19:08] skewlbeta: It built a lot of confidence when I was younger to talk to people and try to get them to buy lol
[5:19:08] keyboardturner: artificial scarcity
[5:19:27] skewlbeta: that said you can buy knockoffs at the store
[5:19:33] MediumRareOG: it's the girl scouts who are in season. they wither and die by april
[5:20:00] apollymae: or they are bored
[5:20:11] Knight_Of_Sarcasm: The knock offs don't taste as good.  Waxy chocolate flavor.
[5:20:16] skewlbeta: naw in the US we're just extreme with customer service. It's typically an anti-theft thing to say hello to everyone

[5:20:52] Dunkurk: I kinda hate the super happy overjopyed shop workers in the US
[5:20:54] Knight_Of_Sarcasm: Don't go down South here.  You even get a discussion on weather.
[5:20:56] jonododds: you just get a stare off people lol
[5:21:03] Pathstrider: maybe down south, up north we talk to randoms
[5:21:27] Pathstrider: yeh i live in manchester, we all chat
[5:21:37] Dunkurk: It was super weird in Anaheim going to target to get deodorant and it was in locked cases
[5:21:43] MediumRareOG: it's the north. no one can understand what anyone is saying anyway
[5:22:08] Knight_Of_Sarcasm: Southern portions of the US are just almost TOO friendly.  And I'm in the midwest so that's a LOT.
[5:22:48] Pathstrider: i grew up in southampton, people are much friendlier and chatty up here
[5:22:52] skewlbeta: well tourists...it's even worst
[5:23:10] RAF_Sean: Got you playing on my CarPlay! Driving with Dan
[5:23:11] Knight_Of_Sarcasm: Just avoid any clerks that say "Bless you heart."
[5:23:25] apollymae: its to let you know that they know you are there so they will see you steal
[5:23:43] mikeygames: I think that cloaks on the pre bis list
[5:23:45] Lausten: Its listing price not sale price aint it?

[5:24:08] apollymae: one of teh reasons yeah
[5:24:09] skewlbeta: yes - I work for a massive retailer and hear a lot about how the best way to deter shoplifters is to acknowledge that they are there and you've seen them
[5:24:37] Knight_Of_Sarcasm: Ad, but have to say that I found it weird that there really ARE smart toasters.
[5:24:41] RAF_Sean: no twitch app, but you’re on my phone for video with the audio coming through speakers
[5:25:10] Dunkurk: Dan tomtom voice pack when
[5:25:15] Pathstrider: round aboot
[5:25:16] skewlbeta: we have roundabouts but they're very rare
[5:25:24] RAF_Sean: lol
[5:25:28] RAF_Sean: yeah
[5:25:33] RAF_Sean: but we use meters not yaeds
[5:25:37] RAF_Sean: yards*
[5:25:39] Lausten: Guess they're smarter in Canada than US Kappa
[5:25:46] physalis4: lol
[5:25:47] Knight_Of_Sarcasm: One of our villages have a round about every block.
[5:26:38] Sery_Bot: The ad break is finishing now! seryboLove
[5:26:41] Knight_Of_Sarcasm: I don't think I could drive in the UK
[5:26:55] Dunkurk: I think every international airport we have in the UK has a massive roundabout right at it
[5:27:09] Knight_Of_Sarcasm: Haven't driven in the US since 2012.  I have my license just no car.
[5:27:13] bwoods79: I lived in Australia for 9 years and hated it when i came back to the US and 4 way stops
[5:27:21] apollymae: what I loved about london is the crosswalks had signs on the ground telling you which way to look for traffic
[5:27:23] Lausten: Not worried about the roundabouts, more the wrong side driving LUL
[5:28:04] Lausten: Im always confused about the zzz lines you have on the road in the UK
[5:28:14] Lausten: Germany or France is my guess
[5:28:17] skewlbeta: is it that one in paris?
[5:28:23] Dunkurk: The lack of manual cars in the US is what irks me, i like to drive a car not so much a gokart
[5:28:25] MediumRareOG: switzerland is the largest roundabout in europe
[5:28:26] bwoods79: If you want to be really confused, go to the US virgin islands... the cars are still left hand drive but drive on the same side as England
[5:29:06] Knight_Of_Sarcasm: They want to spread chaos?

[5:29:39] MediumRareOG: manual cars ard stupid ngl
[5:29:49] Dunkurk: sidegrade at best
[5:30:11] bwoods79: manual cars are like people in wow turning off auto loot
[5:30:11] keyboardturner: manual cars are ass
[5:30:11] Knight_Of_Sarcasm: Manual cars suit some people.  Other people like me can't figure them out.
[5:30:25] Dunkurk: you get better control of speed with engine braking in a manual
[5:30:32] Dunkurk: autos wear brake pads faster
[5:30:37] Greatmatt1: I really enjoy driving a manual.
[5:30:39] MediumRareOG: people thinking they're lewis hamilton with their manual cars
[5:31:14] apollymae: i hate the cars that turn off "eco" when you stop at stop lights
[5:31:25] bwoods79: So are you prepared/excited to buy this house if it is "the one" when you view it this weekend?
[5:31:25] Dunkurk: coasting down the spiral in a multi story carpark with the clutch is BIS
[5:31:39] skewlbeta: do manual cars have the safety controls like auto braking, adaptive cruise control, etc?
[5:31:40] Knight_Of_Sarcasm: I rarely put my automatic in any setting besides "D".  Didn't need the other forward options
[5:31:45] Lausten: The weird lines in UK, are they only at intersections? The zig zag lines?
[5:31:47] RAF_Sean: It would be impossible to drive and twitch chat with a manual
[5:32:21] chelfx: rude
[5:32:25] skewlbeta: the mounties pull up
[5:32:39] StreamElements: dracJAM TWITCH PRIME dracJAM
[5:32:50] Pathstrider: the mounties on manual or automatic moose?
[5:32:56] chelfx: canada be big
[5:32:58] Dunkurk: you'd love niagra falls i feel
[5:33:03] MediumRareOG: Canada - Snow Mexico
[5:33:19] Sindragozer: good ol mexisno
[5:33:21] RAF_Sean: Just tell them it’s Sean from the Navy, they’ll be here in half an hour
[5:33:28] Knight_Of_Sarcasm: I have friends up there.  My best friend is in BC Vancouever.  She's told me that her monthly rent is 2k
[5:33:32] chelfx: did you know canada shared a border with denmark
[5:33:43] Knight_Of_Sarcasm: Other consumables are the same inflation
[5:34:05] MediumRareOG: I'm just gonna say it. Quebecois are more annoying than the French
[5:34:21] chelfx: Canada shares a border with denmark
[5:34:31] Lausten: @chelfx Hans Ø - Hans Island
[5:34:33] RAF_Sean: Meese
[5:34:39] Dunkurk: no he's right the Quebequois are the worst
[5:34:39] MediumRareOG: yes
[5:34:43] bwoods79: You should go to Canada and do a dual stream with Luxthos
[5:34:44] MediumRareOG: and it's deserved
[5:34:49] chelfx: Everyone hate quebec and quebec hates everyone else
[5:34:53] Knight_Of_Sarcasm: In Canada you have to know French to be able to speak in Quebec. It's taught in all the schools.
[5:35:02] Dunkurk: All the arrogance of the French all the entitlement of an american rolled into one package
[5:35:21] chelfx: Its Québécois French
[5:35:30] MediumRareOG: So Canadians have a chip on their shoulder about being not American. Quebecois have that AND another chip on their shoulder about not being Canadian
[5:35:52] RAF_Sean: It’s like the equivalent of Shakespeare english
[5:35:55] Dunkurk: It's like gutterspeak versus common
[5:36:19] skewlbeta: quebec-wa
[5:36:28] Knight_Of_Sarcasm: The Canadians I know are happy to be up there and just visit us
[5:36:36] chelfx: quebec tried to separate from canada in 1995
[5:36:46] MediumRareOG: quebecois -> ke-be-kwa
[5:37:03] keyboardturner: nope, alaskans are very different
[5:38:25] MediumRareOG: Another gripe about Quebecois. They're so intentionally non-Canadian and non-English speakers that (IME) their English is so bad and their accents are so thick I can barely understand them. And I can understand Scottish
[5:38:27] chelfx: alot of money
[5:39:01] Dunkurk: @MediumRareOG You say you can understand scottish buuuuut
[5:39:13] TaliesinAndEvitel: 290 raiders from TaliesinAndEvitel have joined! 
[5:39:16] Dunkurk: we do an "international" accent when we speak to non scots

[5:39:25] RAF_Sean: Kay-bek-wah
[5:39:31] RAF_Sean: Quebec
[5:39:33] keyboardturner: quick @TaliesinAndEvitel make fun of the french

[5:39:55] Knight_Of_Sarcasm: Don't try to understand Cajun.
[5:40:06] izabeL: He's Quebecois
[5:40:06] Dunkurk: XQC is french canadian too
[5:40:10] izabeL: I know him irl
[5:40:16] keyboardturner: i think some french people got really angry at him for some bit he did at one point
[5:40:19] skewlbeta: @Knight_Of_Sarcasm aw but cajun accents are gorgeous
[5:40:21] apollymae: @Knight_Of_Sarcasm too right
[5:40:42] cosmicblood84: Wait the french didnt make french frys my mind fucking blow

[5:41:09] StreamElements: What to Expect from the War Within Pre-Patch - https://youtu.be/-E_BeclbeNY
[5:41:15] MediumRareOG: xqc is a perfect example of someone who notionally speaks English but is absolutely unintelligible
[5:41:15] izabeL: <3 Celine
[5:41:26] MediumRareOG: xqc is the most average quebecois

[5:42:40] Dunkurk: Silent letters at the ends of words ar ethe height of arrogance
[5:42:41] keyboardturner: kwe bek oiz
[5:43:23] cosmicblood84: all i know is north mexico and south canada
[5:43:27] RAF_Sean: Quebecois = kay-bek-wah

[5:45:47] physalis4: my fav music comes from Finland
[5:45:51] MediumRareOG: The national sports of Newfoundland are fishing and bootlegging

[5:46:43] skewlbeta: Louisville, KY sounds like you have marbles in your mouth
[5:46:56] MediumRareOG: "Louisville" is like 2 syllables. "Lure-ville"
[5:47:22] dastago: my favourite fact about american state names is that virginia is literally named after elizabeth i being a virgin
