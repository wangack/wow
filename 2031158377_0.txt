I was thinking to suscribe but when someone is overusing power and bann me for no reasson. Sayin that Raid lider have no idea how first cutter work and we see on second wipe and almost on 3th that I was right. So I am out, it was fun to watch you but I dont wanna be part of this chat until this @pokeypointy is here. To you @pokeypointy go f yourself. I hope we never see each other. Halion
