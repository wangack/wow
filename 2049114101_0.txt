[0:34:15] cabeshpash: what did he say about your teeth?

[0:41:34] thunduz: you know if you're asking me the answer will be go for the mog lol
[0:41:52] frankenfoot5: I feel like Tali's mouth is perfectly engineered to eat welsh cakes faster, so he is clearly superior to us small mouths
[0:42:13] XxJagershotxX: Hey tali, I’ve just come back after not playing for a while, and honestly I’m so lost with all the exclamation points around, where on earth do I start?
[0:42:24] napsta_90: heavy haste cloak/master @TaliesinAndEvitel

[0:46:10] Saumur: It is, but you have to do the Forbidden reach first (but you can skip it)
[0:46:11] XxJagershotxX: returning from 10.0 finished the main levelling experience and that’s it
[0:46:12] random_redshirt: I think the cavern quest was still there last I checked, but you can skip it by flying in directly
[0:46:12] Nulgar: the Zaralek questline requires bits of the Forbidden Reach questline
[0:46:13] Derployd: Zeralek chain is locked behind the Reach
[0:46:14] cabeshpash: the reputation locks of the story quests is the most annoying thing for me

[0:49:00] flexbecs: You can’t just upload videos and stream on the same day! So much content to watch 👍

[0:56:31] urbenjames: urbenjames gifted a Tier 1 sub to edd_3000! 
[0:56:49] ResonantEchos: tneGo tneGo tneGo tneGo tneGo
[0:56:55] MrScotticus: It was 1534 :)
[0:56:57] thunduz: we dual wielding again
[0:57:09] thunduz: stream just went fury
[0:57:30] Rico_Azzarash: CORN TALI YAY
[0:57:33] vlaovich88: Soooo we just need $4,588 USD? Doable haha
[0:57:37] thunduz: it was a fair and fun way
[0:57:55] cabeshpash: :(
[0:58:06] DragnosiOfNede: Are the gods of fate named Evitel?
[0:58:07] Reminii91: prob for the best
[0:58:17] runehako: a 0
[0:58:19] cabeshpash: lol no unless the die is weighted
[0:58:22] MrScotticus: If you have loaded dice I guess
[0:58:29] rynntiltius: isn't that just... chance? LUL
[0:58:34] anxiousbubble: one just one die? no
[0:58:35] cabeshpash: it's equal chance for each side assuming the weight is equal
[0:58:35] thunduz: ok but no one said you can't get 2 BG3 tattoos....
[0:58:36] grimblymcgoo: Thats not how probabilities work
[0:58:36] Sch1ey: If you roll 2 but not 1
[0:58:41] magemaster225: If you add 2 dice theres a distribution
[0:58:44] hitchmeister59: a fair die all sides are equal.
[0:58:44] Durwen: same probability for each side. If there are multiple dice, things change a bit
[0:58:48] Derployd: If you roll two D6s there's apparently a common total, but not from one
[0:58:52] Saumur: Depends theoretically on the surface youre rolling on, whether your hand is sticky and so on. But technically no LUL
[0:58:59] Derployd: Face tatoo for Feb then?
[0:59:08] djalminnha: y
[0:59:08] cabeshpash: yeah
[0:59:28] aeson_of_raid_sock: should get a jailer tattoo
[0:59:45] thunduz: you're supposed to be a bard. you should have gotten a 20 on your roll
[0:59:49] HSAyril: I just saw a red state in the US (Oklahoma) introduced a bill saying you can call animal control on kids doing furry stuff in class
[1:00:10] HSAyril: Like what the actual hell lol
[1:00:13] Sorin__: They also did more layoffs
[1:00:24] thunduz: @Sorin__ they what?
[1:00:25] zaria32vath: @HSAyril idk if that's better or worse than Ohio's and or Florida's bills
[1:00:28] Derployd: Not even going to guess
[1:00:30] Sorin__: the esports divisions
[1:00:32] Biggiediaz: Fah-rees?
[1:00:47] HSAyril: Fair-ees?
[1:00:55] Nulgar: hey, guess what the comments on Wowhead said...
[1:01:05] thunduz: ouch
[1:01:07] HSAyril: WORLD OF WARCRAFT: NOW AN FPS
[1:01:19] holtrop: Man with that valorant esport teams are also in a bad spot so could be even more jobs
[1:01:29] aeson_of_raid_sock: put in a word for jay
[1:01:37] Baraca21: Baraca21 subscribed with Prime. 
[1:01:56] edd_3000: Wonder if she's getting paid as much as Mike Ybarra was
[1:02:04] Derployd: Overwatch had JUST announced a new esports tournament too
[1:02:07] the_howlermonkey: i feel like they shutdown the survival game because htey want ZERO competition with MC, and OW because they want zero competiotion with COD.. they dont want to dilute their products.
[1:02:12] Baraca21: tneMovEviHeartEyes
[1:02:13] zaria32vath: sounds like corporate greed to me
[1:02:13] HSAyril: "Record breaking profits" then, "we don't have funds for that"
[1:02:25] Biggiediaz: ***
[1:02:26] holtrop: i meant overwatch ofc 🤦
[1:02:32] DragnosiOfNede: This is NOT how business work, it's how Stock Traded companies work.  Its why I don't work for them anymore.
[1:02:33] Biggiediaz: Youtube to interview with her.
[1:02:35] Nulgar: Tali, have you heard of the term "glass cliff"?
[1:02:42] grimblymcgoo: "follows you" @TaliesinAndEvitel
[1:02:43] Biggiediaz: It's "Fair-ees"
[1:02:51] CeasiusPls: Man I was really hoping Microsoft would invigorate some of their IP
[1:02:58] Thoreya: someone said shes a diversity here when i was playing wow this morning
[1:03:00] DozlaT: Goes without saying
[1:03:01] HSAyril: Her hobbies include being a mom, yoga, prayer, and she likes D-IV
[1:03:01] djalminnha: cuz ua re the one?
[1:03:02] Thoreya: lol
[1:03:03] CeasiusPls: now all hope is gone
[1:03:07] HelIbomb: what shoulder transmog is on your priest?
[1:03:08] thunduz: she's picked some solid people to follow
[1:03:15] DozlaT: I mean yeah KEKL
[1:03:36] Hebrewish012: no taliesin she personally picked you
[1:03:40] Saumur: So: Someone at Blizz has a really good taste for whom to follow
[1:03:40] BadXo: she has never logged in on the platform :)
[1:03:41] Hebrewish012: she has been a foloower
[1:03:54] thunduz: She followed you because of your D4 streams
[1:03:59] pagan_pg: Psalm 27:13 for location? bleh
[1:04:02] Thoreya: would be a nice change i guess from ybarra
[1:04:11] thunduz: oh and she plays BG3
[1:04:13] the_howlermonkey: tbh, not using twitter is a huge positive for anyone
[1:04:33] Alonarius: She's.. one of us?
[1:04:35] Sch1ey: Woke. Ugh (sarcasm)
[1:04:38] runehako: modless BG3 *
[1:04:39] HSAyril: "One of us"? lol
[1:04:40] Nulgar: I heard Bobby plays BG3
[1:04:41] aeson_of_raid_sock: she had a penrin tattoo I bet
[1:05:13] Sorin__: wonder if she's being paid the ceo rate or the female ceo rate
[1:05:24] kaijoe_: Is she into hyper-growth opportunities?
[1:05:27] blumberquack: Just got here, her blizz message is fine tbh
[1:05:28] databob1: I hope they are paying her properly
[1:05:28] lumaday: Same job tho
[1:05:34] thunduz: that's true
[1:05:37] blumberquack: ...but nowadays I want action, not words :p
[1:05:40] djalminnha: but job is job
[1:05:43] Hebrewish012: bottom line chasers
[1:05:43] Alex_Darkly: Corpo speak :(
[1:05:44] hitchmeister59: I can't wait for the usual YouTube trolls to trash her for being to woke.
[1:05:48] thunduz: theres always a catch
[1:05:57] Hebrewish012: nice executioner :D
[1:06:21] Alonarius: People always have to remember it's STILL harder for marginalised gender and race because they get these jobs and there's always a little voice in the back of their head telling them they only got their job because they tick a box
[1:06:22] zaria32vath: yeah but maybe the nice executioner kills with kindness! :D
[1:06:22] HSAyril: Please don't resist, citizen
[1:06:23] viliman1: "introvert"
[1:06:29] janken4: there will always be a executioner
[1:06:29] blumberquack: @viliman1 Kappa
[1:06:31] Hebrewish012: it's built into her "Role"
[1:06:31] djalminnha: i know the feeling, i am tottaly differnet when i am at work
[1:06:32] random_redshirt: That's the plot of "The Mikado"
[1:06:35] HSAyril: One of us
[1:07:14] HSAyril: Are they?
[1:07:17] Thoreya: if ion ever left id be so sad
[1:07:18] the_howlermonkey: C-Suites are yesmen who dont care about anything but a line going up.
[1:07:27] Hebrewish012: &
[1:07:34] viliman1: bring Bobby back Kappa
[1:07:42] Alex_Darkly: The awkwardness of inviting your boss to a party is how I translate the corporate executives vs normal people
[1:07:42] Saumur: Anyone getting this kind of job is ultimately working against us, in a way. We want a great Video game, the job wants money
[1:07:42] jiveyivey: Requirement for the job should just be willingness to get Penrin's willy tattoo'd
[1:07:43] Hebrewish012: @the_howlermonkey they have to its part of the role
[1:07:51] Thesummerofkevin: wasnt mike one of us? its not like it revolutionized anything
[1:07:59] Kshantos: reminds me of sweeney todd
[1:08:02] CeasiusPls: should we be worried that she's from Activision?
[1:08:04] thunduz: honestly, so glad I spent my blizzcon Saturday wondering with T&E instead of standing in line to meet Ybarra for 2 hours lol
[1:08:10] MeggoArt: do you think microsoft will get rid of blizzcon
[1:08:11] sebggg: We got rid of Bobby....but at what cost
[1:08:12] theszoti: anyone is better than bobby
[1:08:19] lumaday: Think recent events affect the vibes at BlizzCon this year?
[1:08:24] Thoreya: people were saying this decision was gonna destroy wow, then they removed GDKPs in classic wow 4 hours later and everyone celebrated LUL LUL
[1:08:25] the_howlermonkey: @hebrewish012 yes, I know that.. but it just kinda makes them more of a dogshit person imo.
[1:08:35] thunduz: @MeggoArt nooooo they might hear you
[1:08:39] Yuwajin: @TaliesinAndEvitel do you reckon we get a new Warcraft or StarCraft spinoff first?
[1:08:42] therogueone: truly a Monkeys paw wish of getting rid of bobby
[1:08:51] dblanch369: I was never in favor of the merger. this was always going to be the result. Microsoft likes to gut the goose that lays the golden egg
[1:08:59] blumberquack: @Thoreya gonna be honest, i don't think johanna influenced that LUL
[1:09:05] fat_european0: Isn't wow going to be one of the biggest Microsoft games tho?
[1:09:09] Thoreya: meh, ud think its somewhat important since they didnt lay off any wow devs
[1:09:19] DozlaT: Eh
[1:09:21] DragnosiOfNede: Their business model is different.  WoW needs to regular show profit margins at parity with the broader Microsoft (or higher) and Microsoft will leave them alone.
[1:09:23] Thoreya: @blumberquack thats my point LUL , her hiring doesnt mean shit in wow stuff
[1:09:33] magemaster225: no more MAU breakdowns, only 200million Xbox MAUs
[1:09:38] fat_european0: Oh like that, yeah sorry I misunderstood you
[1:09:39] therogueone: Microsoft makes their money from their diversification, not any singular project. they can lose any singular thing and they'd be fine, yeah?
[1:09:50] DozlaT: You're asking that when Microsoft is tauting their investments into ai as of late
[1:10:00] Rico_Azzarash: Who want a sub?
[1:10:08] Thoreya: @Rico_Azzarash me
[1:10:11] therogueone: yeah 😭
[1:10:11] Thoreya: :)
[1:10:15] Sharktribe: I like what they've done with the Age of Empires series
[1:10:18] thunduz: So how excited should I get for a WoW crossover event with FF14 now that FF14 is also coming to microsoft
[1:10:22] random_redshirt: Wow might have special value as being able to sustain a subscription player base by itself, rather than having to be bundled with a bunch of other games through Game Pass.
[1:10:23] slappygilmore_: spro___ subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 3 months, currently on a 3 month streak! 
[1:10:23] Yuwajin: @TaliesinAndEvitel it seems like a lot of higher ups at Microsoft would want a new Starcraft right?
[1:10:31] Rico_Azzarash: Rico_Azzarash gifted a Tier 1 sub to Thoreya! They have given 1492 Gift Subs in the channel! 
[1:10:32] dblanch369: hopefully they get broken up for monopoly-antitrust like they did in the 1990s
[1:10:32] therogueone: @Sharktribe very true, AoE team has done great
[1:10:34] frankenfoot5: WoW gets a lot of QOL  improvements when Blizz is struggling. Microsoft won't give a shit if its less profitable
[1:10:45] Thoreya: @Rico_Azzarash legend!! thank you lol
[1:10:48] thunduz: I do love me a crossover
[1:10:53] blumberquack: @thunduz WoW with 14? Meh... but Diablo with 14? Gimme that PogChamp
[1:10:56] rws2626262626: Really worried with a Harvard/NFL marketing person + MSFT which has a TERRRIBBBLEEE record of managing games they ran enormous franchises, Halo, Gears of War, Fable, Age of Empires into the ground.   Everyone give her a chance though because they're going to need all the help they can get to not fuck this up.
[1:11:07] Rico_Azzarash: 1 yaer for Thoreya !!!
[1:11:15] schlakt: you think wow would be better off without the Microsoft accusition?
[1:11:18] thunduz: @blumberquack tneTaliCry but I am terrible at diablo
[1:11:21] HSAyril: If wow goes on gamepass we're gonna see a ton of MTX cosmetics
[1:11:22] datadietz: hell yes a T&E Stream
[1:11:33] Thoreya: pogpogpog tneEvi tneEvi tneEviHeart tneEviHeart
[1:11:42] Nulgar: @blumberquack 10 hours of cinematics between each fight
[1:11:48] therogueone: oh god LUL
[1:11:49] Alex_Darkly: Oh nooooooo
[1:11:50] fat_european0: oh no
[1:11:53] theszoti: suits are always bad, but we can say we don't have bobby anymore at least
[1:11:53] KeyouiX: no
[1:11:53] Nulgar: don't
[1:11:54] datadietz: is it a shit show? obviously
[1:11:54] rws2626262626: Blizzard could likely benefit from more marketing spend though, I think (with the exception of D4) they do undermarket.
[1:11:55] Arlaeya: oh nooooooo
[1:11:55] ResonantEchos: nooo
[1:11:56] placeholdername33: uh oh
[1:11:57] Kshantos: better not
[1:11:59] blumberquack: @Nulgar I'll take it still LUL
[1:12:00] lumaday: lol
[1:12:01] lonesomecowboy: yeah lets just wade into chernobyl lets go
[1:12:03] therogueone: please, I was having a mostly pleasant morning tali
[1:12:04] frankenfoot5: Microsoft has always helped produce Gears of War....so I'm confused why you feel like its "run into the ground" other than the fact that one of the leading main characters has different genitals lol
[1:12:06] Nulgar: hope the staff have cleaned up
[1:12:06] DozlaT: Oh God if the layoffs are any indication I don't wanna read em
[1:12:06] Purplestuff1: It was a shit show obviously
[1:12:14] schlakt: is it going to be a shitshow obviously?
[1:12:22] thunduz: I was just going to ask how overall the community has reacted. I have seen some haters but I don't know what the overall opinion is
[1:12:26] Alex_Darkly: I'm thinking of playing SoD 2 for the same reason, lore bits
[1:12:30] blumberquack: I saw a comment like "she didn't code or make games at all!" and I immediately thought "oh, like Bobby Kotick then?" :p
[1:12:40] Arlaeya: I can't make another toon, i just can' but lore....
[1:12:41] ChaadLosan: up
[1:12:46] Natolaeh: passed it
[1:12:49] Yodamoo: If Microsoft needs WoWs money less, maybe they will put less pressure on monatization and allow more room for fun? lol (maybe I'm a dreamer :p )
[1:12:52] dblanch369: Wowhead hasn’t really covered her that much that I saw
[1:12:53] thunduz: quickly raises my hand
[1:12:55] ChaadLosan: you passed it page 3
[1:12:55] blumberquack: Apparently D4 S3 isn't great
[1:12:55] Nulgar: tbh I'd be way more mad about lore stuff in SoD than in a book
[1:12:56] fat_european0: Yeah, the new season missed
[1:12:56] frankenfoot5: I'm enjoying Diablo 4 atm! Lots of fun
[1:12:56] Rico_Azzarash: No. I like it
[1:12:57] Sharktribe: couldn't be less interested in diablo
[1:12:57] str4ysheep: on the 3rd page
[1:12:58] Yuwajin: Season 2 was great and 3 is okay
[1:12:58] DragnosiOfNede: Absolutely, Diablo IV is a shit show..... obviously...
[1:13:01] GrimFandango: It was so bad on launch that I just don't even think about it anymore
[1:13:01] Derployd: No, they apparenlty saved the current season
[1:13:01] OmgItsEdizzle: Yea... it's pretty bad atm
[1:13:03] kaijoe_: Everyone hates everything right now.
[1:13:06] kikisume: I'm enjoying this diablo season
[1:13:06] Thesummerofkevin: i dont think anyone cares enough to hate it lmao
[1:13:07] therogueone: I havent touched it, and my friends who did play it didnt like it
[1:13:07] magemaster225: it crawled back up to mid after patches
[1:13:13] rynntiltius: people always hate Diablo, it's the only way to play the game Kappa
[1:13:14] HSAyril: Played it through once for story, not touching again until the expansion
[1:13:17] DiscordianKitty: *calia* DO NOT TRUST HER
[1:13:17] Alex_Darkly: Diablo just didnt feel fun. :\
[1:13:18] iheb_lock: Well people hate anything blizzard does , but they're pretty good imo
[1:13:23] GrimFandango: ?
[1:13:26] Yuwajin: it was at launch, but the game is so good
[1:13:31] Famine80: not really hate, just feel.. ..indifferent, disappointed
[1:13:34] Sharktribe: She's an evil corp, but she is beautiful
[1:13:35] databob1: wasn't interested in d4 from the start
[1:13:35] blumberquack: Tali, you sure you want that? The comments section would shit themselves over her being a girl
[1:13:38] thunduz: ask Evi
[1:13:41] i_identify_as_a_mistake: I don't hate it, i just got bored of it really fast
[1:13:44] Sorin__: well its not as good as yale
[1:13:44] blumberquack: ...though they probably already are LUL
[1:13:50] sowercookie: Harward is in a bunch of scandals rn
[1:13:52] Yuwajin: I think Harvard people tend to hold that over people
[1:13:54] thunduz: tneEvi
[1:13:59] Derployd: Season 3 was released to negativity, but they released a bunch of hotfixes that appently fixed most of the issues with the design issues
[1:14:21] DozlaT: Idk I just think of Alan dershowitz when I hear Harvard lol
[1:14:26] GunsEvisu: harvard is the training ground of evil
[1:14:31] HSAyril: Why does Harvard being in scandals have a bad reflection on its students?
[1:14:36] frankenfoot5: My girlfriend and I are loving Diablo 4. It's a great mindless couch coop game for us
[1:14:37] DozlaT: Yes
[1:14:38] lumaday: Someone just told me Diablo IV feels like an incomplete game. Lack of endgame and such.
[1:14:41] vague_pumpkin: wasn’t she the President of the university?
[1:14:47] Sharktribe: Harvard sold body parts of enslaved people and indigenous folks that theyve had in their vaults of centuries
[1:14:57] DozlaT: She was interim
[1:15:05] thunduz: @Sharktribe they what?...
[1:15:15] Akaveary: Deans run departments?
[1:15:16] CeasiusPls: Chancellor?
[1:15:21] therogueone: Emperor?
[1:15:23] rynntiltius: WutFace
[1:15:24] Nulgar: @lumaday tbh they say that about every AAA game these days, and it's only true like half of the time
[1:15:27] Sharktribe: Double check me but yeah that's what the word is. Democracy now had a bit about it
[1:15:31] 22vrivers: nah she deserved to get fired nothing to do with political agendas she couldn’t even condemn genocide against Jews
[1:15:31] the_howlermonkey: thats some Lovecraftian cult shit
[1:15:36] blumberquack: ...we already got a battlepass LUL
[1:15:43] Akaveary: It was a shit show
[1:15:48] rws2626262626: Presidents of large Universities in the US also literally are just fundraisers/alumni association builders, they actually don't set curriculums, or standards or anything like that at all.
[1:15:50] DiscordianKitty: did anyone still like ybarra
[1:15:51] thunduz: didn't ybarra have some connection to COD?
[1:15:53] frankenfoot5: Are we looking for forum comments for the next Weekly Update?
[1:15:59] ChaadLosan: Of course it was shit show.
[1:15:59] DozlaT: They expected Phil Spencer himself
[1:15:59] lumaday: @Nulgar Is there a decent gameplay loop?
[1:16:00] Sorin__: #nochanges
[1:16:04] sowercookie: They thought MS would save blizz...
[1:16:08] thunduz: tneEvi tneEvi tneEvi
[1:16:12] mydknightblack: oddly the guy leading the charge against that president has a bit of mix up in some eugenic psuedo science !
[1:16:25] Thoreya: are we agreeing with wowhead comments LUL LUL LUL
[1:16:27] funviking99: people were so happy when microsoft acquired blizzard , poor fools
[1:16:33] therogueone: "I'll take anyone over Ybarra" (another finger curls on the monkey's paw"
[1:16:35] Kshantos: as if bobby hat any clue
[1:16:36] CeasiusPls: doesn't microsoft usually let companies do their own thing? I mean Todd Howard is still there right?
[1:16:37] camba4ever: I expected more resources available to Blizz teams to make their games
[1:16:42] blumberquack: I'm slowly turning into a corn cob D:
[1:16:53] rynntiltius: I guess I'm fundamentally clueless  HypeCool
[1:16:56] Vaephera: I don't really understand the description of her as being an activision suit. She'd been general manager for less than 3 years after working her way up, not one of koticks circle that normally refers to
[1:17:04] thunduz: tneEvi  does that make me qualified to be a game dev or president since I don't like diablo?
[1:17:04] cabeshpash: LUL
[1:17:17] therogueone: LUL
[1:17:20] frankenfoot5: No no, Tali, you're right. Here I was thinking I was enjoying a video game, but KoveeGedde has proven me wrong. I have seen the light now.
[1:17:26] sowercookie: @ceasiuspls afyer they fire a bunch of people yeah. But that's also been a huge problem for MS games, like with halo and bathesda. It's all a mess really
[1:17:29] Yodamoo: I am only allowed to do what commenters say I am allowed to do :(
[1:17:30] ChaadLosan: [[]mm\
[1:17:31] hitchmeister59: No. You're not allowed to have fun in the wrong way.
[1:17:37] Sch1ey: Truth
[1:17:41] blumberquack: Like how all the beast master mains don't REALLY understand how hunters work Kappa
[1:17:43] Derployd: Without being allowed to buy themselves out from under the heel of a publisher, Blizzard and all the other development houses under ABK and MS will have to endure high end corporate puppetry.
[1:17:48] Akaveary: Horses are terrible people
[1:17:59] thunduz: no you, no no you choose, no way bro you choose

[1:18:22] DragnosiOfNede: If they keep Metzen, we’ll be fine
[1:18:31] Vaephera: She started as COD esports comissioner then general manager
[1:18:39] DozlaT: where was that attitude for the layoffs from them? I just read a lot of schadenfreude
[1:18:49] mydknightblack: will this new president NOW finally redo the witch doctor model in d3 or give us gnomes that can be black?
[1:18:49] Vaephera: would be similar to holly longdale I guess
[1:18:49] MrScotticus: She manages the general
[1:18:49] thunduz: she generally managed cod?
[1:18:52] HSAyril: She generally managed things
[1:18:56] cosmopanda13: she is obvously managing the general
[1:18:56] Derployd: Isn't Hight the General Manager of WoW?
[1:18:58] cabeshpash: LUL LUL LUL

[1:19:18] WingBreaker23: Put a celebrity skin in it and make it LAME!
[1:19:19] Blloood: General manager is not really a complicated title to understand...
[1:19:26] aeson_of_raid_sock: what does a song by Hole have to do with cod?
[1:19:33] thunduz: dude people love zombies
[1:19:35] frankenfoot5: Definitely no way that Call of Duty was trying to compete with Fortnite in 2018...
[1:19:38] rws2626262626: Celebrity skins are fine, it's making sure they don't cost cut quality into the ground
[1:19:40] sebnificant: Celebrity skins incoming for WoW!
[1:19:45] blumberquack: She invented zombies PogChamp

[1:20:02] camba4ever: it's a long time franchise staple
[1:20:03] Akaveary: Careful she’s a hero
[1:20:06] databob1: I always demand zombies
[1:20:06] therogueone: Shes offically the "COD Zombies GM" in my head now, and that will never change
[1:20:06] Sch1ey: Women cant do zombies thats a manly thing tho
[1:20:08] frankenfoot5: Tali please, don't be ridiculous. Women can't have good ideas. (/s)
[1:20:09] alextheblight: Jamie Lee Curtis skin for Jaina
[1:20:12] Fibnkak: Fibnkak subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 55 months! Why are people surprised at all this stuff honestly.  They noticed the next gen of players willing to pay all there free money for fortnight and mine craft then cry when these people suddenly do this to other games. And as my 55 month reward i get to say  GO Wrexham GO Can't want to see Swansea vs Wrexham games in the CHmapions league.
[1:20:14] thunduz: oh god

[1:20:22] HSAyril: Comment of the day lmao
[1:20:22] ResonantEchos: woof
[1:20:22] Akaveary: Oh no
[1:20:23] somniorum: ... get ready Metzen : P
[1:20:25] runehako: gotta love dudes hatin just shes a woman
[1:20:26] Sharktribe: gross
[1:20:29] cabeshpash: I just want my pally dwarf to look like shaquille o'neal
[1:20:29] Akaveary: The sexism
[1:20:34] DiscordianKitty: What is the woman's place?
[1:20:38] DozlaT: It's so obvious they weren't around for when ppl hated metzen
[1:20:38] vlaovich88: That sounds like some misogyny...
[1:20:39] Derployd: "Hush Johanna" - Metzen, probably
[1:20:45] blumberquack: @DiscordianKitty Above Metzen LUL
[1:20:57] 22vrivers: you know this was going mygoinst
[1:21:08] thunduz: That whole world saga that we only have 3 names and vague ideas look so good
[1:21:12] DozlaT: Falstard wildhammer modCheck
[1:21:16] HSAyril: Look here, woman
[1:21:22] DiscordianKitty: i do enjoy when people stop pretending to have legitimate complaints and just admit they're doing a sexism
[1:21:25] chief_hakoda_91: but doesn't he?
[1:21:26] runehako: the insecurity of these dude bros is just hilarious
[1:21:30] Chlamydious: he doesnt!? D:
[1:21:35] DiscordianKitty: zero doubt they're doing a bit of a racism as well
[1:21:35] therogueone: Obviously Metzen just strolls around slapping his giant lore on the table and gets whatever he wants
[1:21:37] FatCatDad48: It's like these people have never had jobs or bosses
[1:21:38] cabeshpash: metzen should run blizzard
[1:21:48] sowercookie: I thought we hated Metzen and liked that he left? No he's our hero now, again? Oh internet...
[1:21:51] Alex_Darkly: @cabeshpash He'd have a stroke istg
[1:21:51] frankenfoot5: @therogueone I'm pretty sure Blizz fired those guys a few years back
[1:21:54] Discordant_Hats: Discordant_Hats subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 14 months! Prefer the new manager, purely because I find her #Blessed Christian mum twitter bio, funnier as a manager trait than Ybarra's Gamer Bro shtick. The first is just better sitcom material and that's what I mainly use to judge.
[1:21:56] Akaveary: People simp super hard for Metzen
[1:21:56] chief_hakoda_91: Metzen's last name is Blizzard
[1:21:58] alextheblight: two-letters-followed-by-bunch-of-numbers username sure has a weird idea of what Metzen does at Blizz now
[1:22:00] Fibnkak: Yes people are stupid
[1:22:08] thunduz: Cheer100 the quesiton isn't what does he do it's what he is?
[1:22:08] DozlaT: I think they do honestly. There were a ton of folks shitting on historians other day for being laid off
[1:22:19] therogueone: @frankenfoot5 true!
[1:22:21] Derployd: Oh yeah, people absolutely do think that, the level of stupidity in this community can be insane
[1:22:28] cabeshpash: @Akaveary cause he's an OG who wrote the best of the warcraft storylines
[1:22:44] DiscordianKitty: and yet somehow nothing that goes wrong is his fault
[1:22:47] chief_hakoda_91: Metzen is Blizzard's Chuck Norris
[1:22:47] the_howlermonkey: metz probably doenst even meet with the president... not high enough up
[1:22:49] Fibnkak: @alextheblight almosst as bad as name followed by 6 numbers like the bots on X
[1:22:50] XxJagershotxX: I mean, with blizzards past, I wouldn’t exactly be surprising 😂
[1:22:51] thunduz: smart
[1:22:52] aeson_of_raid_sock: they just posted some traders items for February
[1:22:56] DozlaT: Best storylines like forgetting falstad wildhammer exists
[1:22:58] frankenfoot5: Metzen also wrote some bad storylines guys lol, he's only human
[1:23:13] HSAyril: CEO isn't a proper job?
[1:23:15] therogueone: LUL
[1:23:19] Alex_Darkly: Ew why would you want that though LUL
[1:23:20] zaria32vath: that's relatable
[1:23:21] Derployd: Never bring up the waybackmachine
[1:23:30] HSAyril: Ohhhh
[1:23:35] DozlaT: Ok Mr director
[1:23:35] Durwen: quick, start getting receipts!
[1:23:39] rws2626262626: Bloomberg had some report a while back I think about some insanely stupid microsoft idea that they didn't need to like spend on story/world-buiilding anymore (a few execs saw like palworld of something).  Dear god I hope she's able to see how dumb those people are, it's the definitive edge of Blizzard's games.
[1:23:39] Rico_Azzarash: Grow up Tali! You will never get another job!!!! XDDDDDDDDDDDDD
[1:23:42] Fibnkak: You me like the Steamer Gerdo that i use to watch suddenly everything he has done is gone
[1:23:43] DiscordianKitty: actually that reminds me I might have a question for you
[1:23:43] thunduz: uh oh, what am I gonna do about this T&E tattoo on my lower back?
[1:23:51] Blloood: Atleast hes self aware that hes baby rants on the internet isnt respectable content
[1:23:51] mxfelwinter: if Konami CEO can end up forcing Hideo Kojima, one of the most respected gaming icons to resign, Blizz new president can do so with Metzen
[1:24:06] aeson_of_raid_sock: this man fathered 2 children with a coworker
[1:24:16] thunduz: full penrin scene appointment being made now
[1:24:19] frankenfoot5: I literally deleted all my personal social media when I got a "real" job. I don't think these wowhead commenters are aware how things work
[1:24:20] sowercookie: @frankenfoot5 no he's perfect and never did no wrong, everything bad was Danuser! /s
[1:24:21] alextheblight: @Fibnkak yeahh, tried to do a spin on it lol
[1:24:27] alextheblight: my own spin, rather
[1:24:33] cabeshpash: 100%
[1:24:40] DozlaT: Remember that God awful metal gear solid zombie game?
[1:24:43] CeasiusPls: I no longer have any hope for the gaming industry, lol
[1:24:44] cabeshpash: Konami is a shadow of its former self
[1:24:51] Xullax: the power of shareholders
[1:25:07] Fibnkak: SO they will finally dump Overwatch
[1:25:09] alextheblight: just look at Silent Hill (not by Kojima, but good lord)
[1:25:20] DozlaT: Yep
[1:25:25] Sch1ey: Does she even sell CE?
[1:25:27] chelfx: you need atleast 3k io to elad blizzard
[1:25:28] sowercookie: 3 billion market cap btw
[1:25:41] alextheblight: "ooh, new scapegoat"
[1:25:44] therogueone: yeah, how dare she have experience at other places, I prefer my CEOs to have high mythic plus ratings and to sell mythic runs and be one of us Kappa
[1:25:47] frankenfoot5: "Mass departures"....do you mean the mass layoffs, Garlakk?
[1:25:49] KaosDevice: any merger causes restructuring.
[1:26:01] Fibnkak: All at the same time too
[1:26:14] RyukenYama: Trading post items are up
[1:26:15] aeson_of_raid_sock: does heelz have a video on this?
[1:26:20] chico_escuela: missed a big chunk of the stream…. did you look over the trading post?
[1:26:29] pyndul: wowhead comment think tank is not sending their best
[1:26:30] therogueone: oh no
[1:26:34] ResonantEchos: NOOO
[1:26:35] Akaveary: Oh god
[1:26:36] Sharktribe: noooo
[1:26:38] Akaveary: Plz
[1:26:39] Yuwajin: I don't get anyone making excuses for the biggest corp in the world with record profits that can set their own trends and survive not laying people off
[1:26:39] Fibnkak: If only you did better on you maths and not on your english then we can all find out the maths
[1:26:40] Akaveary: No
[1:26:41] frankenfoot5: Taliesin, I've got it! I know who *should* be the new Blizzard CEO. It's Team Liquid's raid leader, Maximum! /s
[1:26:41] DozlaT: Get your hazmat on everyone
[1:26:42] chief_hakoda_91: they'd save more money sacking their ceo
[1:26:43] sowercookie: Chat I'm sad
[1:26:44] therogueone: Seeing that will ACTUALY ruin my morning LUL 😭
[1:26:46] aeson_of_raid_sock: I’m so sorry lol
[1:26:46] Derployd: Don't do it to yourself, Tali
[1:26:47] alextheblight: fox mount hoooo
[1:26:48] Durwen: I have the theory that all CEOs have a discord group and share tips and tricks
[1:26:52] 22vrivers: are you going to torture us now
[1:26:58] Akaveary: The pee drawer guy does
[1:27:00] DozlaT: Huh
[1:27:03] GunsEvisu: FACKING PRONOUNS
[1:27:03] HSAyril: The most important opinion I want about this is Asmongold's
[1:27:04] alextheblight: oh god please no
[1:27:06] fortmax98: @TaliesinAndEvitel Why give that POS any kind of airtime
[1:27:19] FelPlague: @TaliesinAndEvitel feb's trading post preview is up and its HUUUUUGEEEE
[1:27:21] DozlaT: Phew

[1:28:28] mxfelwinter: oh no, now i am reminded that reactionary crybabies are trying to apropiate the Yakuza/Like a Dragon franchise
[1:28:32] Vaephera: There were far worse, wowhead purge the worst of them
[1:28:33] cabeshpash: I was expecting more misogyny tbh
[1:28:42] alextheblight: ???
[1:28:45] DozlaT: Alright
[1:28:47] random_redshirt: ...what
[1:28:50] alextheblight: Harvard? What?
[1:28:52] aeson_of_raid_sock: traders items are on wowhead
[1:28:54] Thoreya: have fun with that game LUL LUL
[1:29:00] kaijoe_: lol You mean the game where the SE president is all in on AI?
[1:29:01] Kshantos: its "woke"
[1:29:03] frankenfoot5: (FF14 is coming to Xbox, is Yoshi P immune to Phil Spencer somehow?)
[1:29:05] cabeshpash: it is
[1:29:07] Darkuwa: Being smart is bad to the right wing
[1:29:08] cabeshpash: yes
[1:29:10] anxiousbubble: yep
[1:29:11] Sch1ey: Yup
[1:29:15] camba4ever: being a breeding ground for anti-semitism
[1:29:16] sowercookie: Is it cause college is "woke"?
[1:29:17] DozlaT: Anti intellectualism is big in a big way
[1:29:17] Xullax: the university?
[1:29:19] Fibnkak: The right has called it a Liber bastion of the woke and yes it is a dog whistle
[1:29:20] cabeshpash: right wing hate educated people here lol
[1:29:21] mxfelwinter: wowhead have moderators, unlike Blizz who lay them off...
[1:29:22] bettys_dungeon_adventures: yes Harvard is the new right wing thing
[1:29:22] DozlaT: Back**
[1:29:24] vlaovich88: It's got a bad wrap as being pretentious and "ivory tower"
[1:29:26] therogueone: yeah pretty much
[1:29:27] hitchmeister59: Ejumacation bad!
[1:29:30] KeyouiX: education in general i think
[1:29:32] Natolaeh: also elitist, because it is ivy league
[1:29:32] grimblymcgoo: educated in general
[1:29:32] cabeshpash: everything in education is part of the woke agenda to them lol
[1:29:33] Sch1ey: Higher learning in general
[1:29:35] aeson_of_raid_sock: but Harvard is right wing
[1:29:38] anxiousbubble: the whole "liberal indocrination" thing
[1:29:40] beefgoggles: they go after education in general
[1:29:44] frankenfoot5: @Tali re: Harvard. Yes, it's a right-wing populist dogwhistle.
[1:29:47] kiljoy102: I am wary of her for her time in the NFL due to the OWL being run like the NFL and it basically ruining the E sports scene for OW.
[1:29:50] 22vrivers: yeah actually wowhead had actually hide their comments because of the racism and overt sexism
[1:29:56] cabeshpash: reality has a well known liberal bias
[1:29:57] Sharktribe: American conservatives have always been conditioned to be suspicious of any sort of medical, scientific or medical authority
[1:30:06] Sch1ey: Yes
[1:30:10] sowercookie: She's educated, must be woke!
[1:30:14] rws2626262626: Well it used to mean (to me) a specific sort of PE mindset of just run a company on current revenue inertia and cost-cut the shit out of everything, I don't mean it in terms of any liberal culture war nonsense.
[1:30:15] Sch1ey: The commenter does
[1:30:20] tifas_sweaty_armpit: As a poor person I see Harvard and think oh good a Business Master going to milk the crap out of Warcraft and not someone that graduated from a  Video Game Background etc. not poliitics related
[1:30:28] HSAyril: She does yoga, she's liberal /s
[1:30:31] dumbracoon: Obama went to Harvard so Republican have hated it even since.
[1:30:38] frankenfoot5: Definitely don't look at all the US Presidents that came from Harvard. Definitely no Republicans or Conservatives from there. Definitely not.
[1:30:43] 22vrivers: because they are really intimidated by success women
[1:30:44] anxiousbubble: thats what they think; regardless what is likely
[1:30:45] Promilie: Honestly most of the complaints seem to boil down to "woman bad. Black people bad"
[1:30:46] KeyouiX: the religious stuff makes me think shes not liberal
[1:30:47] hitchmeister59: No one educated falls for MAGA bullshit.
[1:30:51] rws2626262626: In simple terms (business ruthlessness on the highest level)
[1:30:53] aeson_of_raid_sock: so did Ted Cruz
[1:30:53] Sharktribe: So did George W Bush, right?
[1:30:59] Caladin_the_Paladin: It's simple. Smart people seek truth; rightwingers deal in lies so that makes them the enemy of smart people; therefore, smart people and institutions are the enemy, regardless of what each individual believes. They have to vilify them all to convince their base that they (rightwingers) are the good guys.
[1:30:59] mxfelwinter: remember during raegan era, right wing claimed universities were making people into "communists"
[1:30:59] DozlaT: The Dersh did but they don't know him
[1:31:01] grimblymcgoo: @hitchmeister59 I wish this was true
[1:31:03] aeson_of_raid_sock: bush is a yale
[1:31:04] Fibnkak: Marketing degree from Harvard. might as well have e art degree from Yale (looks around to make sure Evi is not on the stream)
[1:31:11] therogueone: I know someone who has a family member who gave a bagel to a guy once who made eye contact with someone from harvard... they must be w o k e
[1:31:14] DozlaT: That's not true
[1:31:41] DozlaT: I meant that intellectual people can fall for it
[1:31:45] Kneckt: Cruz went to harvard and princeton, still a twat lol
[1:31:47] rws2626262626: People who think she's a woke plant have lost the game already
[1:31:54] Rico_Azzarash: Tali. Do you think it's a bad idea for me to apply to Blizz as a game designer right now?
[1:31:55] Caladin_the_Paladin: Not all smart people are liberal.
[1:31:56] Derployd: On the political spectrum, they all lie
[1:32:00] frankenfoot5: Fun fact, did you know, Harvard actually revokes your degree if you are conservative? They only allow left wing people in who drink brew their own kombucha.
[1:32:08] Fibnkak: Plenty of humans Lie. if you don't you might not have had a child yet
[1:32:09] therogueone: @frankenfoot5 LUL
[1:32:14] Xullax: european liberal diffes from american liberal
[1:32:14] KeyouiX: my uncle went to duke and he's a repbulican (non trump one though)
[1:32:20] mydknightblack: the money saddled donor class who have  hidden out of shame. Now lift their heads to reclaim that which they lost ...ego driven control
[1:32:26] cabeshpash: bernie tried, but he lost :(
[1:32:27] Derployd: Sorry, they don't lie, they just refuse to tell the truth
[1:32:37] anxiousbubble: word "liberal" confuses me because here is Australia its our right wing party LUL
[1:32:49] warpride777: when fidel nationalized cuba that was communism lol
[1:32:56] Fibnkak: labot unions
[1:32:58] sowercookie: But Tali how are they gonna skim off the top if we change the system!
[1:33:02] databob1: that's true
[1:33:07] zaria32vath: honestly there is issues on both sides.  just sucky that one side likes to decide how people live, ie: "don't be trans." stupid thoughts
[1:33:09] random_redshirt: So, what's the difference between her and Ybarra that Microsoft would want her in place instead?  That's my question.
[1:33:12] EighthEndless: @Fibnkak labot unions sound interesting
[1:33:29] ChaadLosan: failing upwards
[1:33:30] HSAyril: Both
[1:33:33] Fibnkak: @EighthEndless Together we Bargin, Alone we Beg.
[1:33:34] Rasguer: tali i love you
[1:33:44] mxfelwinter: after the 2008 disaster, the people that trigger it became teachers and council members onuniversity, because america, tali
[1:33:48] therogueone: shes the COD BO4 Zombies creator and you cant change my mind
[1:33:53] Kneckt: a t&e quote? ugh cringe Kappa Kappa
[1:33:58] Derployd: As a manager, not a dev, however, we've not had a former dev run Blizz since JEB
[1:34:00] 22vrivers: did you hear Ben Shapiro released a rap video
[1:34:19] rei__03: Make Ion the CEO Pog
[1:34:20] sowercookie: @random_redshirt my theory is that they wanted their guy in, as opposed to Ybarra who was someone else's guy
[1:34:26] therogueone: LUL LUL
[1:34:28] rws2626262626: Well Kotick (my understanding is) rarely Blizzard played games
[1:34:29] frankenfoot5: Like how Larian Studios operates. But that's not how most companies work, Benadar
[1:34:31] Kneckt: LUL
[1:34:31] mydknightblack: i remind you liberals are not hiding from space lasers of religious origins or trying to own humans based on a similar idea..
[1:34:49] FelPlague: @TaliesinAndEvitel feb's trading post preview is up and its HUUUUUGEEEE
[1:34:57] DozlaT: pwease Mr CEO be nice to us
[1:35:01] warpride777: every time wealth gets redistributed there will be winners and losers
[1:35:06] EighthEndless: im a dirty angry socialist, tali YOURE NOT MY REAL DAD
[1:35:06] Fibnkak: No on likes the games i Like. Battlechess is a refined taste
[1:35:16] placeholdername33: Last guy played a ton of wow, look how wel lthat turned out
[1:35:18] Derployd: Yes. All dev studios should buy themselves out from under publishers, but the studios will never allow it
[1:35:21] thunduz: uh oh you said the words
[1:35:25] Noznatation: But we can't change anything though :D So hopium is all we got.
[1:35:30] mxfelwinter: that will never happen as long as shareholders exists
[1:35:34] funviking99: we want someone who does +26
[1:35:37] warpride777: greed and gluttony is part of sin and stays with man
[1:35:38] Xullax: Tencent owns Larian too
[1:35:46] Rasguer: tali i love youuu
[1:35:46] therogueone: oh i didnt know that, dope. another larion dub
[1:35:55] random_redshirt: @sowercookie That's the weird part, though.  Ybarra was ex-Microsoft and knew a bunch of higher ups there already.  Faries is Activision, no history with Microsoft from what I can see.
[1:36:03] Derployd: Once these studios are owned by publishers, they're fucked
[1:36:17] Fibnkak: When do we get our Hardcore BG3 Stream.  I have died 4 times now and it hurts everytime. I want to share that pain with you
[1:36:26] rws2626262626: Ybarra clearly left when he got the news he wasn't getting her job based on his tweet (not sure what to make of that)
[1:36:27] XxJagershotxX: Tali I’ve just noticed your characters name underneath all the tabs, is that a Little Britain reference by any chance?
[1:36:43] therogueone: LUL
[1:36:52] sowercookie: @random_redshirt i imagine there's multiple Factions within MS with their own interests. But it's all my speculation based on what I've seen at my work
[1:37:06] RosieSeren: my parents argued because my dad desperately wanted to call me myfanwy, he lost
[1:37:11] zaria32vath: I guess just another reason to like Larian other than the inclusion of trans identities in their game
[1:37:25] tgrippa_: Justice for Quik LUL LUL
[1:37:31] Derployd: "Why did you greenlight all these fucking hires?" *chop*
[1:37:37] Durwen: Nah, man, in Corporate, you "spend time with family" when you've gotten fired
[1:37:45] RosieSeren: do you like the myfanwy song tali?
[1:37:53] Promilie: Ybarra left on his own accord to seek "Hyper Growth Opportunities" naturally
[1:37:57] netonkent: I remember you  been disappointed about the Microsoft buying blizzard because alot of been will get sacked
[1:38:22] random_redshirt: @sowercookie I agree, I just don't see how Faries would fall into that compared with Ybarra.  They replaced someone who already knew Spencer and who openly sang Microsoft's praises with someone who hadn't worked with them before the merger.
[1:38:25] DozlaT: Yep
[1:38:31] dwolf010: @taliesinandevitel did you see the new trader post items?
[1:38:45] sowercookie: @random_redshirt maybe he crossed someone? Who knows
[1:38:50] hitchmeister59: The best she can do is stand aside and say, "Make games players like, so we can sell more."
[1:38:55] Noznatation: oh yea I see nothing about her that makes her worse than the last 2 - 9/10 of the ppl crying are just mad it is a woman ofc.
[1:38:57] therogueone: LUL
[1:38:57] influx_404_: Just joined. let me guess, bad news?
[1:38:59] warpride777: if the people a corporation hires does little work, its product or service shows
[1:39:04] mxfelwinter: even more in USA where it is very easy to fire people, even when having all time record profit
[1:39:06] screamnfetus: Feb trading post items are up
[1:39:20] RosieSeren: they are so cute this month
[1:39:24] frankenfoot5: Your kids will lead Myffanwy to glory against whatever threats Azeroth faces in 60 years
[1:39:28] cardrenn: you better live to one hundred
[1:39:53] mxfelwinter: from what i got, in other countries, you can only lay-off workers if you are at risk of bankrupcy
[1:39:57] warpride777: like that lady from goggle that shows up late everyday, exploits the latte room and yoga room, yeah google will lay her off if she just prances around like a princess all day lol
[1:39:58] Ganryu22: You want the game to continue to avoid a job and you care about the workers. You are such an hysterical communist high on vegan smoothies
[1:40:21] warpride777: no production
[1:40:23] DozlaT: ?
[1:40:28] random_redshirt: @sowercookie That seems more likely to me.  Better a fresh slate than someone who might have bad blood with his old coworkers.
[1:40:34] Sharktribe: @Ganryu22 Please tell me this is a joke
[1:40:35] Xullax: LUL
[1:40:47] theszoti: they would lay you off without a heartbeat
[1:40:55] Nulgar: hey, Basado might ironically, unintentionally be onto something here. Google the term "glass cliff"
[1:40:57] Kshantos: allways shit on companytime
[1:41:04] grimblymcgoo: Not a single company cares about you
[1:41:11] Kneckt: i havent touched a support ticket for 20 mins while watching ur stream tbh LUL
[1:41:14] sowercookie: They will fire you if you work overtime or if you slack off, that's the bullshit job way
[1:41:15] warpride777: yeah i do the bathroom then break not bathroom on break
[1:41:17] djalminnha: thank you
[1:41:18] the_howlermonkey: Never poop on your break. Poop on company time
[1:41:23] KeyouiX: i'm a lifeguard, the goverment pays me to sit on my phone for half my shift
[1:41:27] therogueone: I have exactly 3 categories of jobs that I consider "critical and important for human society" and I have never worked one of those jobs
[1:41:40] EighthEndless: i am, ironically, a paperpusher at a papermill (100% recycled fiber, tho, which is nice lol)
[1:41:41] Synkronos: I work as a software dev in the eHealth department of my provincial Department of Health :P
[1:41:42] Nailez: @grimblymcgoo not true, the ONLY companies that do (at first anyway) is startups so until they make money basically
[1:41:45] Deatheran: @taliesinandevitel employer makes a dollar manager makes a quarter I make  a dime
[1:41:48] Caladin_the_Paladin: Amen, brother!
[1:41:50] JimothyOnline: Boss makes a dollar, I make a dime, that's why I poop on company time
[1:41:51] tifas_sweaty_armpit: drs are kinda bull shit, no way anyone is worht 700k a year
[1:41:58] EighthEndless: im getting paid to watch T&E right now, so thats great lol
[1:42:05] Promilie: And then they act as if employing me is their kind gift to me
[1:42:06] the_howlermonkey: The Director of T&E always poops on company time.
[1:42:08] Kneckt: the new trading post items are HOT
[1:42:08] rws2626262626: Yeah but what about "the dignity of work" that retired landlords tell us about?  They're leaving all that for us.
[1:42:10] riffraff005: tneComradeTal tneComradeTal tneComradeTal
[1:42:10] XxJagershotxX: I work in betfred, I’m not doing any work currently cause I’m watching you. shh don’t tell
[1:42:12] KaosDevice: Viva la revolución
[1:42:12] Nulgar: @KeyouiX imagine if people were like "ugh, why do we even need lifeguard, all they do is sit around"
[1:42:14] Darkuwa: or play wow all day while wfh
[1:42:19] Noznatation: but if I took a 2h shit break - when would I have time to play wow?

[1:42:43] frankenfoot5: "Oh no, someone is stealing a fraction of a penny from Google, what a poor multinational billion dollar corporation"
[1:42:44] sowercookie: She didn't shuffle enough spreadsheets what ever shall we do
[1:42:46] DozlaT: The same Google who saves billions by investing in laying ppl off
[1:42:47] theszoti: would somebody please think of the shareholders?
[1:42:49] JimothyOnline: Thoughts and prayers for Google
[1:42:50] Xullax: poor Google BibleThump
[1:42:51] rws2626262626: She should be the next WoW Hero of Azeroth, amen

[1:44:11] Xullax: scumbags
[1:44:21] sowercookie: Reason: didn't wanna give you a pension lol
[1:44:21] ArkyteCurse: As a salaried worker I do my job and that’s it. you pay me to do my job and not sit in front of a computer 8 hours a day. if I only have 25 hours of work this week I’m only working 25 hours. Period
[1:44:26] mxfelwinter: that's just fucking evil

[1:45:13] Proxzo: Seriously, the manager who original hired him was probably long gone.
[1:45:17] ArkyteCurse: why would I ask for more work when you aren’t paying me more. no thanks
[1:45:22] warpride777: would i be loyal to a company that lays you off after 24 years
[1:45:26] mxfelwinter: and there is also nepobabies that are both rich and also get scholarship
[1:45:29] Nailez: Real question, can we go back in time and remove Henry Ford from existance for creating the 9-5 job!!!!

[1:52:43] FelPlague: i think thats a misprint
[1:52:43] Nulgar: wait, when these were datamined, they were shoulders
[1:52:43] blumberquack: Why not? Wear the pink cape with your manliest DK shoulders
[1:52:45] Rico_Azzarash: YES! 100%!!!!!!
[1:52:46] MeggoArt: this way you can layer it with shoulders?
[1:52:47] frankenfoot5: METZEN WOULD HAVE MADE THEM SHOULDERS
[1:52:48] BeeboBiggins: they previously showed it as shoulders i think
[1:52:49] Promilie: wtf they were shoulders on PTR
[1:52:49] FelPlague: its prob shoulders and its misprint
[1:52:51] Sch1ey: I think i like cloak more

[1:52:59] kaijoe_: Johanna strikes again
[1:53:01] vein42069: *sad trombone*
[1:53:04] FelPlague: they are def misprint cause they are supposed to be shoulders, and ingame they are shoulders
[1:53:04] therogueone: maybe thats just a description, and not a technical slot?
[1:53:06] mxfelwinter: maybe because they couldnt add physics if it is on the shoulder slot?
[1:53:07] Nulgar: this must be a mistake in the article, this happens too often - further down it says a wrist bouquet is "hands"
[1:53:08] Sharktribe: There's no way they're a back slot.
[1:53:08] databob1: it used to be shoulders in ptr
[1:53:17] ebrahim_91: Hope it's a typo
[1:53:20] aeson_of_raid_sock: Johanna put hearts on everything too
[1:53:23] Proxzo: Could you put shoulders over this technically then?
[1:53:24] magemaster225: theyll give you 3 versions probs, one for each side and then together
[1:53:29] netonkent: Joana made everything pink haha 😝💜

[1:53:52] Fibnkak: three someone is trying to get lucky.
[1:53:52] Sharktribe: It's not a back slot.
[1:53:54] Nulgar: Search for "Dueler's Rosy Shoulder Cape" on Wowhead, it's a Shoulder item
[1:53:55] FelPlague: @TaliesinAndEvitel pretty sure that is a misprint, they are ingame as shoulders
[1:53:55] MikeyGy: JOHANNA AND THIS DISENY BS Kapp
[1:53:59] Derployd: Anyone know if any of them were those that were sold on the store with tendies?

[1:54:08] blumberquack: so probably LUL
[1:54:14] Sch1ey: They def look like shoulders
[1:54:19] Nulgar: Tali glinting at comments: "I think this is a misprint"
[1:54:23] zaria32vath: yeah because if you have shoulders on then it would clip
[1:54:35] Thoreya: fake news
[1:54:37] frankenfoot5: See? I told you Metzen would have made them shoulders.
[1:54:41] vein42069: *happy trombone*
[1:54:44] HeavyHarper: No, you're shoulders feenNo
[1:54:47] jiveyivey: Obviously, it's not shoulders or back. It's a cape. :)
[1:54:48] therogueone: oh and they are selling the pink cape at the same time!
[1:54:52] Nulgar: well you can wear another shoulder item on the other shoulder
[1:55:00] Derployd: searching the wowhead database has them as shoulders, but 'cape' is in the name, most likely the confusion was caused by that
[1:55:03] runehako: do they have those arm condoms in black?
[1:55:19] Sharktribe: I like the tabards. I missed the fur one
[1:55:30] runehako: good good need it for my Mizora toon
[1:55:31] therogueone: "Y'all want some more PINK to go with your PINK?" - traders post this month
[1:55:48] RosieSeren: yeah we had gold last month
[1:55:57] databob1: I putting my male kul tieren in that sailor moon suit
[1:56:02] mxfelwinter: they are prayer baids
[1:56:03] FelPlague: yes its an updated version of the scarab dress from the trio in AQ
[1:56:12] FelPlague: it shows your hips and is very thin
[1:56:14] therogueone: yeah you cn still use shirt, tabard,
[1:56:14] Nulgar: we need a "Neck" transmog slot
[1:56:20] MrScotticus: They really need to just make a neck cosmetic slot
[1:56:22] HebbyB: I wanted that dress so bad from AQ40 back in the day
[1:56:25] Mosquithor: They dont look that good on females unless you have a really good matching tabard
[1:56:33] therogueone: thats a legit crown yeah
[1:56:34] Harai_Ulfsark: we also need 3 cosmetic slots on the head
[1:56:59] Darkuwa: Parasol slot
[1:57:00] avatos_94: does the crown take your hair?
[1:57:04] runehako: its 2024 lemme show my damn hair under hats already
[1:57:12] RosieSeren: impatient tali :D
[1:57:12] mxfelwinter: we need hats/helms that doesnt delete your hair!
[1:57:14] djalminnha: thats what she said
[1:57:29] therogueone: OH
[1:57:29] Derployd: crowns usually don't? Am I right on that?
[1:57:42] therogueone: isnt that the mythic color?
[1:57:42] RosieSeren: yes
[1:57:46] therogueone: or is it just similar?
[1:57:59] mxfelwinter: obviously, they should have it all previewed on human male
[1:58:02] holyzeke: why do they call them cloaks when they are really more like capes?
[1:58:09] Nulgar: the crown is already on Wowhead, it does seem to NOT remove hair
[1:58:11] Kshantos: sailor moon wands
[1:58:12] kaijoe_: Sailor mooooooon
[1:58:12] blumberquack: Tempted to buy the wand for my warlock
[1:58:12] zaria32vath: oooh the heart things
[1:58:18] SquiggySquonk: I'm so getting the Sailor Moon wand.
[1:58:20] frankenfoot5: I like the shield, staff, and bow a lot
[1:58:20] EighthEndless: very kingdom hearts
[1:58:22] random_redshirt: That is some magical girl wand stuff going on
[1:58:25] Durwen: Very Magical Girl
[1:58:26] mxfelwinter: magical girl wand
[1:58:32] anxiousbubble: my sailor moon cosplay is now complete!
[1:58:36] runehako: pretty sure ive seen those heart staves in some anime
[1:58:41] FelPlague: That split blade is 1000% an old model they have dug up and it just happens to match.
[1:58:44] therogueone: yeah we have
[1:58:45] random_redshirt: yes
[1:58:46] EighthEndless: yea, i have them
[1:58:47] RosieSeren: they look familiar
[1:58:48] frankenfoot5: Recolor
[1:58:48] Derployd: repeats
[1:58:49] Sch1ey: Its a crime the hearts are attached to the min shirts on the sailor moon tmogs. They would be bis
[1:58:50] Nulgar: yes, they are returning items
[1:58:54] zaria32vath: I like it!
[1:58:56] Sch1ey: Mini*
[1:59:00] Dipichipii: I adore it
[1:59:02] RosieSeren: I adore that transmog, its so cute
[1:59:04] mxfelwinter: nah, it looks too ugly
[1:59:08] frankenfoot5: If that witch attire isn't worn by every Kul Tiran male I'll riot
[1:59:08] Durwen: Now that is very Magical Girl
[1:59:09] zaria32vath: I get a skirt in wow now
[1:59:10] blumberquack: Manliest mage mog:
[1:59:12] FelPlague: cant wait to wear my programmer socks felplaLove
[1:59:20] runehako: finally a full mog appropriate for my orc
[1:59:24] bigmeanbeefy: A good month to save tendies imo
[1:59:28] databob1: too much that I want
[1:59:28] zaria32vath: thigh highs!
[1:59:32] Merlock_Holmes: And all it costs is 100000 tender.
[1:59:33] MetaPunk: cant wait to put it on my orc warr tbh
[1:59:36] zaria32vath: every trans girls dream
[1:59:38] Sch1ey: The skirt has the ugly heart which should be the belt it makes me mad
[1:59:39] Trebled_Mind: so love ISNT in the air with this Trading Post? 😂
[1:59:40] RosieSeren: very very good month!
[1:59:41] mxfelwinter: it looks very ugly and the hat delete the hair...
[1:59:59] blumberquack: Probably not
[2:00:00] runehako: prob will be
[2:00:00] Nulgar: probably not (yet)
[2:00:01] therogueone: oh important question
[2:00:02] BeeboBiggins: prob will be
[2:00:05] Hebrewish012: should be its a flier
[2:00:05] zaria32vath: eventually probably
[2:00:07] RosieSeren: probs not yet
[2:00:08] MrScotticus: Almost every mount will be soon
[2:00:08] tiyanigean: not yet I'd say
[2:00:09] FelPlague: dont think so, if it was they prob woulda said so
[2:00:11] Gynebra: So is the fox mount the reward for filling the bar this month?
[2:00:12] ArkyteCurse: I think the foxes will be in TWW
[2:00:23] FelPlague: @TaliesinAndEvitel you know 100% if it was it woulda been  ENJOY DYNAMIC FLIGHT ON THE ....
[2:00:27] Nulgar: @Hebrewish012 by "dynamic" we mean like Dragonriding
[2:00:28] runehako: wait till it goes to 100tender like the rocket
[2:00:29] Gynebra: Ahhh heck
[2:00:35] horngano: oh the costume is bonus reward? BigW
[2:01:06] therogueone: its leather
[2:01:07] RosieSeren: leather
[2:01:08] blumberquack: Leather
[2:01:10] Musihus: male
[2:01:12] KaosDevice: any clues on what the upcoming Pirate Patch will be?
[2:01:13] shaymster: the toy?
[2:01:15] RosieSeren: I have the blue version
[2:01:24] FelPlague: I do wonder where the rcolopur of the witches attire will be
[2:01:38] FelPlague: i want the blue one to live out my programmer socks tmog
[2:01:39] RosieSeren: maybe love is in the air event?
[2:01:41] Derployd: halloween?
[2:01:42] Nulgar: Hallow's End?
[2:01:42] blumberquack: I'm wondering if the magical girl wands have custom SFX, like the Mechagon guns
[2:02:00] FelPlague: or maybe each year will bring out another recolour
[2:02:08] frankenfoot5: I can make a Sailor Moon character now if I want to. Cool
[2:02:55] DuxOnline: Hey When does the MDI start?
[2:03:06] Phil87z: people were so mad
[2:03:11] Mosquithor: Why?
[2:03:16] netonkent: Do you think Holly would have been better for president? Personally Holly is too good to waste on finance decisions
[2:03:16] djalminnha: thats is aotc siege of orgrimmar wolf
[2:03:18] RosieSeren: I think it would be better to just add it to the boss loot, so people can get it again
[2:03:24] Sharktribe: It was so stupid. Let people earn cool things in the game they pay for.
[2:03:26] MeggoArt: i saw more backlash to the backlash than actual backlash
[2:03:29] grimblymcgoo: make it a timewalking raid reward, just not traders post
[2:03:41] FelPlague: it was normal then got changed ot heroic once mythic got added
[2:03:43] Nulgar: to be fair, the Wolf is technically not skill-based, since you could buy a boost :p
[2:03:43] Mosquithor: Enough time hsa passed that the mount should be availible to everyone
[2:03:47] vlaovich88: One of my very few skill mounts!
[2:03:49] bigmeanbeefy: It was siege of orgrimmar, but it was from normal and heroic i think
[2:03:55] dragonswing0: Dragon pepe up in Valdracon
[2:03:59] Derployd: I don't mind it being obtainable again, just not from a store purchase. Having it from a timewalking pandaren raid, no issues.
[2:04:01] RosieSeren: @grimblymcgoo yeah thats a really food idea
[2:04:06] Nulgar: I was from Normal, which is now the Heroic difficulty
[2:04:08] FelPlague: normal until mythic got aded, then it was heroic
[2:04:10] kikisume: I hope they put it as a prime amazon drop lol
[2:04:13] ShipWight: siege was first mythic raid from what I remember
[2:04:24] jimbowheat: @dragonswing0 Ohh, where?
[2:04:24] Durwen: I've got this mount. I'm mostly ok with it because I want AOTC that I don't have :p
[2:04:31] Sygorian: They need to implement a system for people who werent around to get old rewards if you do sth similar, like the rated pvp tokens
[2:04:36] horngano: curve
[2:04:36] blumberquack: Voidwing was my first AOTC PogChamp
[2:04:37] frankenfoot5: Man I wish I got the Moose mount. We were so close to curve
[2:04:38] dright424: I would like if they added in something like min ilvl raids from FF14 to give old AOTC mounts
[2:04:40] Fibnkak: I want a feet of strength achivement that give behind the curve from buying the curve mounts  and there is nothing wrong with that you be you.
[2:04:44] Sharktribe: It wasn't difficult to get, it was to pressure subscriptions during a content drought
[2:04:45] MeggoArt: no it was curve
[2:04:46] Nulgar: @ShipWight it had LFR/Flex/Normal/Heroic until WoD prepatch, which changed that to LFR/Normal/Heroic/Mythic
[2:05:01] alextheblight: (I assume we're talking about the aotc mount) could give the original tint in SoO timewalking. Problem solved
[2:05:10] grimblymcgoo: @Sharktribe Yea SoO was out so long a ton of people could get it
[2:05:16] djalminnha: hypo is so cool
[2:05:19] ShipWight: @Nulgar Oh right, I forgot that
[2:05:27] frankenfoot5: I loved the Hippo farm updates in your videos back then. It made me so happy when you got it
[2:05:33] vlaovich88: I was super proud of getting that mount but it was so long ago, I don't mind one bit making it available again.
[2:05:47] alextheblight: luckily you can still get your very own Maurice
[2:06:00] alextheblight: maybe one day
[2:06:17] Sygorian: You should be able to get curve mounts with curve "saddles" equivalent
[2:06:28] Derployd: Which is the right way to do it in my opinion.
[2:06:37] tifas_sweaty_armpit: kinda fucked up if you could buy your mount for 100 tendies
[2:06:41] Mosquithor: Why would you care, you had your moment. I dont see why people would be upset that they make a mount widely availible after 10 years
[2:06:42] FelPlague: I don't think anything should be removed from the game. Do what they do with vicious saddles, and the mythic raid mount. make them a thing you gotta go out of your way in the future to get but still requires effort
[2:06:50] grimblymcgoo: @Sygorian Curve saddles during these fated seasons would be nice
[2:06:53] Sharktribe: I have no sympathy for the "i got mine, F you" attitude people have about exclusive, time-limited cosmetic rewards. Some of the players active now were literal kindergarteners back when it was current
[2:07:05] horngano: swift zulian hehe
[2:07:29] duat_auru: the only mount i have that's exlusive that i kinda don't want to share w/ other players is the bi gryphon from Legion you had to hunt for
[2:07:33] Thowarr: A recolor is the same
[2:07:35] djalminnha: they said at this time, and i dont like that cuz there is posiblity that someday will happen
[2:07:36] Rico_Azzarash: Yet I want that bear druid forms from mage tower D":
[2:07:54] Sharktribe: A recolor is not the same, actually lol. It's a different color
[2:07:55] Mosquithor: People should not be punished for not playing the game 10 years ago, exclusivity is good, but for a time, after that its just a way to turn people away from the game as they feel too much behind and that they missed a lot
[2:07:55] blissy416: AOTC should give saddles that let you buy old AOTC mounts
[2:08:12] Thowarr: And yet you can still buy the Brutosaur now
[2:08:15] jimbowheat: I donated for that longboy!
[2:08:17] FelPlague: I want them to add one that is blue and with no npcs
[2:08:23] tifas_sweaty_armpit: People shouldn't be punished for putting in the work 10 years ago either
[2:08:24] duat_auru: i do wish i could get the vaporwave bird from nighthold tho
[2:08:28] JMcGhee559: I did every mage tower in legion and I'd be ok if they made those available to other people somehow.
[2:08:28] RosieSeren: someone faked a tweet about the brutosaur
[2:08:33] BrigAndSigConnection: Id rather they just scale your ilvl down to the old raids and allow you to earn those mounts, similar to how you can scale down in ff14
[2:08:37] FelPlague: I think recolours but with no AH mount would be fine
[2:08:46] Sharktribe: Just let everyone earn everything. I have all the time-limited rewards, CM, mage tower, mounts ,etc. I don't get less from my stuff if others enjoy it
[2:08:54] FelPlague: Giving everyone the Ah part would be a bit lame
[2:08:56] RosieSeren: Yeah I want big dino
[2:08:57] KaosDevice: I was 250k short when they yanked it of the merchant, I was heartbroken.
[2:09:03] Ladryn: they should give it a slightly shorter neck
[2:09:15] menzlo: I just want recolor highlighter cat forms for the love of god
[2:09:18] Nailez: i want CM gear back, with ilvl sync entirely possible now to make also current
[2:09:26] CpnRad: there is a degree of FOMO that should stay, especially with a game this long
[2:09:35] tarnishedvalor: i'll happily take a pink auction brutosaur
[2:09:37] BrigAndSigConnection: i understand it from a labor standpoint from blizzard, you have all these assets just sitting around not making you money. as a business thats a terrible model.
[2:09:41] djalminnha: i would never putz that mount on TT
[2:09:45] Thowarr: Because people will still complain even if it's a recolor
[2:09:46] d0mezg4mer: is there a bmah in the dragon isles?
[2:09:49] alextheblight: hmm
[2:09:50] Sharktribe: As the rest of my comment said- The exclusive rewards aren't valuable because others can't get it now, that makes me feel worse.
[2:09:59] FelPlague: A big issue with fomo is coming to the game later, seeing something you like, and being told its impossible to get
[2:10:02] d30xx: recolors of mounts don't make it seem different or unique
[2:10:05] blumberquack: I want a brutosaur that's just a painted giraffe
[2:10:06] RosieSeren: I think recolours is the best compromise
[2:10:07] Harai_Ulfsark: @d0mezg4mer yes, below the whelp daycare
[2:10:08] jimbowheat: @d0mezg4mer there is
[2:10:20] Sharktribe: People pay money for this game, LOTS of it via subscription. Let them earn stuff.
[2:10:20] CpnRad: can I have a brutosaur that is actually a bunch of cat mounts stuck together?
[2:10:21] Espartico: what is fomo, precious? what is it?
[2:10:22] schlakt: my biggest hope in wow is to get another shot for the long boy
[2:10:36] Oliraptor: I think new things/models are good! more new things!
[2:10:38] menzlo: Please highlighter cat form
[2:10:50] ShipWight: I would be happy to have a tendie recolored brutosaur without AH. I just want to ride a big dino
[2:10:52] vlaovich88: Collection is a big part of the game. Ascetic is an important part of the game. Saying something isn't available because you didn't play 10 years ago isn't a good feeling.
[2:10:59] CpnRad: what if the recolour is better though?
[2:11:00] Musihus: not having unobtainable cosmetics later removes the last character permanence from wow.
[2:11:02] Fibnkak: Trading post has flails
[2:11:13] alextheblight: I want them to re-implement them, recolors or no, because I want them to fix the prot paladin shield one (disc doesn't rotate like the other skins)
[2:11:13] blissy416: they could let you get all of the mage tower appearances except the base colour maybe??
[2:11:23] Mosquithor: The idea that a new player looks at an item or a mount and thinks "I will NEVER be able to get that" is just bad, there should be at least some sort of recolors of the same models that you can still get
[2:11:24] MidwesternPickle: was happy to be able to get the guardian druid form from the world boss since I never got one from mage tower
[2:11:35] ajman1101: i feel having cosmetics be time limited is fine, having game functionality being time limited is not (mounts w/ AH, Tmog, Bank, etc)
[2:11:42] d0mezg4mer: your server is popping tonight
[2:12:13] blissy416: i was always sad that i’ll never be able to get the mage tower cat forms. it sucks.
[2:12:14] Thowarr: Then they should've been playing at that time
[2:12:14] CpnRad: how about you can get the CE/AOTC etc mounts but it gives you a debuff if it isnt the original
[2:12:23] Oliraptor: there is so much good stuff in this game you can get X]
[2:12:44] Proxzo: I think that Legends are really cool in this game.
[2:12:52] Proxzo: Like the scarab mount
[2:12:55] BrigAndSigConnection: easy solve, when you get one of those achievements, you get a token and you can buy all the past or current reward for that exact achievement!
[2:12:57] Mugsy47: wouldn’t happen
[2:12:58] Proxzo: It's like a legend in gaming
[2:13:03] Phenroi: That happened with me and Mythic+, I wanted it, so I worked for it (the mount)
[2:13:04] Proxzo: that's important I think
[2:13:06] menzlo: There are no cat forms as cool as the mage tower ones
[2:13:13] theszoti: me aswell
[2:13:14] Mosquithor: I would say more often than not they will have a negative reaction, I still thing exclusive items are good, but after some time it loses a point
[2:13:15] MrScotticus: I think it's ok for a reward to be challenge-based, but "playing the game at a specific point in time" isn't a challenge
[2:13:19] Caladin_the_Paladin: Happened to me too.
[2:13:19] Harai_Ulfsark: scarab was probably their worst iteration of this tbh
[2:13:21] 3le_MentaL: 100% agree with that. Looking at players with titles/mounts/xmog that i no longer was able to get made me wanna go get into that content and complete it.
[2:13:23] MrAxeffect: why do players all want AOTC
[2:13:23] raiel1569: Exactly Tali. totally agree.
[2:13:24] Lefleksik: but I wanna phoenix, not a dragon recolour hm
[2:13:24] Andy_Andreaa: @menzlo never been more sad maining druid after legion without doing mage tower
[2:13:27] tifas_sweaty_armpit: I will make sure I get a guild, learn to play, get along with people. Not just afk in LFR then get a cool reward....oh wait it will be 100 tendies in 5 years
[2:13:30] Fibnkak: But what if they don't like the new and wanted that old thing?
[2:13:35] j1bear: participation trophy generation 👀?
[2:13:36] Proxzo: Not just for aspiration but just for like the mystiq and interest of the game
[2:13:36] alextheblight: nobody notices my "of the Black Harvest" title on my lock. Prestige is a lie :(
[2:13:36] menzlo: @andy_andreaa me too
[2:13:39] fat_european0: I agree. Aspirational content is really important
[2:13:43] CpnRad: @MrScotticus veterans played through Seige of Orgrimmar for nearly two years, that is definitely a challenge
[2:13:47] netonkent: I like the warfront rewards to be soloable now though
[2:13:49] riffraff005: true - i dream of getting the brutosaur one day. i have a little over $1M gold, as a filthy casual
[2:13:55] menzlo: Some old things are objectively better than new things
[2:13:56] Proxzo: Like Grand Staff of Jordan
[2:14:16] Fibnkak: Do you ever get the Season limited gear? @TaliesinAndEvitel
[2:14:16] viliman1: one of the assumptions are they exist
[2:14:18] vlaovich88: I think things should be exclusive for 1 whole xpac after it was earned and then can be added in.
[2:14:22] katsumira: Recolor/ change name items mounts
[2:14:34] MrScotticus: @CpnRad Ok, but if someone is equally good at the game now, why shouldn't they be rewarded similarly? Why is having a subscription a decade ago an accomplishment?
[2:14:54] CpnRad: @MrScotticus you are rewarded similarly, with that tiers relevant reward
[2:14:56] menzlo: I am still upset as somebody who missed legion, not concern trolling
[2:14:57] tifas_sweaty_armpit: TRUUUU
[2:14:58] itsplastiko: If you can't collect cool unique stuff over the years that shows you've been here for a while, what's the point, might as well go and play seasonal games or something like that
[2:15:00] Thowarr: @MrScotticus Because as Tali just said, FOMO is cool
[2:15:08] gefuffel: there should be otherway of obtaining things like the pvp stuff, I've played wow since 2004 and i've had no interest in PvP ever but I would love the reward. So instead of having the reward giving me something to aim for its just locked behind content that I'm not gonna do
[2:15:09] Mugsy47: Now that wouldn’t happen
[2:15:12] Sharktribe: lol this is exactly what Asmond is doing
[2:15:16] CeasiusPls: to be fair the new player experience prevents me from getting my friends to join
[2:15:18] MrScotticus: @Thowarr I disagree :)
[2:15:19] menzlo: I did
[2:15:23] Mosquithor: I dont think its simply black and white, but I think he does have a point
[2:15:33] Thowarr: @MrScotticus I disagree as well
[2:15:36] Harai_Ulfsark: i started retail in legion, so missed the mop cloaks, i just moved on and got the mage tower appearances for my main
[2:15:57] BrigAndSigConnection: becasue they are watching a steamer who is playing it
[2:16:07] ArkyteCurse: and they usually have some sort of knowledge of it via friends or family
[2:16:09] lonesomecowboy: aspiration is not a big concern for me, but what I do think is cool/important is the like almost emergent storytelling in your community of having stuff like i KNOW someone was a gold farmer in BFA with that brutosaur or if someone has corrupted ashbringer i immediately have a good idea of their history with the game thats a cool feature of a 20 year old game
[2:16:10] menzlo: They pick it up because it's still the best mmo
[2:16:11] HebbyB: If they made new ways to relive that old content in a meaningful way, I think it'd be great to reintroduce some of the rewards for new players to get it too
[2:16:13] boubotte: as someone who joined a couple of months ago, I can't lie, I'm a bit frustrated that there's lots of things i can't get at all
[2:16:15] gefuffel: just have it release 2 expansions after it was there, like the person who got gladiator will still have the achievment and people who dont enjoy that can get it eventually
[2:16:23] zaria32vath: it wasn't my thought when I first started playing.  I wanted the jenkins title so that motivated me to level and continue playing and learn the game to get the title
[2:16:27] Lefleksik: new player has no idea there is so much stuff, like too much stuff, and every single time they search, they are intrigued, not discouraged
[2:16:45] raiel1569: Just say what you wanna Tali… sometimes you can’t have everything…. like me I don’t PvP. I won’t be able to get those rewards. That’s ok with me.
[2:16:53] BrigAndSigConnection: I would love archeology to be redone and be something like chromie but rewards old gear/mounts
[2:17:01] Thowarr: maybe not that 1 mount, but when you start talking about ALL the mounts they can't get (and xmogs to boot) then maybe
[2:17:02] blumberquack: ...I mean it does kinda suck not having the undercity plaguebat :p
[2:17:14] stormz_wow: i just want some iconic class related quests back. i.e. all i care is if they can bring back benediction staff quests
[2:17:25] drizzeh33: wish i had a chance to get that lion bow from ulduar
[2:17:28] CpnRad: not being able to down Viscidus to finish my tmog set isnt very cool to be honest
[2:17:34] Mosquithor: Keep those items exclusive but add recolor alternatives or something, is my solution
[2:17:48] my_mystake: need a little bit of a stick to push you forward
[2:18:06] menzlo: Recolor is good
[2:18:09] valkyrcat: As a mount collecter who started late bfa, I wasn't mad that I couldn't get the old mounts, I thought it was really cool!
[2:18:12] databob1: Recolor would be fair enough
[2:18:17] Darkuwa: Off topic: Can you say that really long welsh town name?
[2:18:17] CpnRad: give everyone the mounts/mog but if they didnt get it at the time, give them the Poser debuff
[2:18:25] jdodge1305: I feel if someone really wants to get upset about someone getting something they got 10 years ago, they can just link the achievement that is date stamped to show they got it back then
[2:18:26] StraightErro: @CpnRad the ooze? you always got next expac when any class can collect any tmog
[2:18:30] grimblymcgoo: I think another thing with the AoTC wolf was that it was one raid that had a TON of lore associated with that particular mount. We raided the city and bsically took the mount from garrosh's elite soldiers
[2:18:41] fat_european0: Same with Scarab Lord. The history behind it is why it's such a cool mount, the model itself isn't even that neat. If everyone had it, it wouldn't be anywhere near as cool
[2:18:42] doomer_dan_: @cpnrad for Viscidus, find an old weapon on the AH that has frost damage!
[2:18:52] netonkent: Did you think they should stop the raid lockout for old raids, so people can farm transmog?
[2:18:56] Lefleksik: Accually archelogy rework could make it and reward recolours with cool quest aside
[2:19:05] havvorthia: I don't get FOMO because if anything it has made me reach out and learn my class good enough to get to KSH, be able to join a pug for AOTC and even dabble with some PvP.  It's fun having a goal to work towards.
[2:19:12] CpnRad: @doomer_dan_ IIRC im not sure there's a weapon with enough speed now that also does consistent frost damage to solo it
[2:19:15] alextheblight: @CpnRad I think there's a MoP enchant that can help (if you're melee, anyway). That's how I got it on my paladin
[2:19:21] ShipWight: @CpnRad buy a <ilvl50 weapon and enchant elemental force. Cost me 10G and took about a minute melee'ing. FWIW I used a dagger
[2:19:25] AnarchyMoose: AnarchyMoose subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 40 months! happy wednesday tali. have you ever met charlie cox? you apparently know like every english actor so im quizzing you haha
[2:19:30] BrigAndSigConnection: just put vendors in the game for each achievment type, when you earn the achievement you get a token that you take to the vendor and can buy the new reward or any of the past rewards for that achievement. That why the models and labor (artist) doesn't go to waste after the season ends.
[2:19:31] Thowarr: This person got the brutosaur: they spent most of BFA selling Freehold Runs... awesome!
[2:19:35] alextheblight: yeah, elemental force; that was it
[2:19:46] doomer_dan_: @cpnrad hmmm gotcha. maybe a higher speed weapon + an enchant?
[2:19:55] boubotte: I don't mind having stuff complicated to get, I think that's very cool, but I am frustrated that there's stuff that I just can't get at all :/
[2:19:55] Caladin_the_Paladin: I have the bruto; never sold a single run.
[2:19:57] fat_european0: Yeah they're AH goblins
[2:19:59] RosieSeren: I think recolours is the best solution, both sides win
[2:20:01] TheDeekins: I got my Brutosaur with a little luck on Mythic raid BOEs, and a TON of zinanthid farming
[2:20:03] gefuffel: Its skewed against PvE players though, the PvE stuff can always be collected in later expansions but PvP stuff just dissappears
[2:20:09] Thowarr: Half my guild got Brutosaur via selling FH runs
[2:20:26] tarnishedvalor: i haven't paid for years
[2:20:29] Thowarr: Leveling in there was super fast and profitable
[2:20:33] tarnishedvalor: i looove the AH
[2:20:40] Proxzo: "Congratulations you won the economy"
[2:20:41] StraightErro: All the lucky people what printed gold using the old garrison on alts
[2:20:46] d0mezg4mer: the wow token is super consumer friendly I love it
[2:20:56] Andy_Andreaa: sat in the ah window tsm on the second monitor
[2:20:58] lonesomecowboy: boost runs are not as lucrative for m+ anyway
[2:20:59] Syllvn: Anyone else not able to login to Bnet?
[2:21:01] JimothyOnline: One of my friends basically used to pretty much control the Argent Dawn auction house. Made over 300 million in Legion
[2:21:01] jimbowheat: billions!
[2:21:07] lonesomecowboy: unless you have like
[2:21:11] lonesomecowboy: an insane amoutn of time
[2:21:20] ebrahim_91: since the trading post is giving us extra 500 that means were getting 1500 tenders this month yes?
[2:21:31] doomer_dan_: Hot take, I’m aware, but I miss mission tables and idk why people are glad they’re gone. Easy passive income via totally optional gameplay
[2:21:36] d0mezg4mer: yeah I'd still prefer it didn't exist but it's the best version of gold buying I think could exist
[2:21:37] d30xx: Buying it with real money is the problem
[2:21:55] MeggoArt: careful, don't tell joanna
[2:22:00] fat_european0: I spent so much wow gold on Diablo Immortal
[2:22:04] CpnRad: wish we could just have gamling in WoW, let me get my gold that way
[2:22:04] d30xx: 100%
[2:22:08] CpnRad: gambling*
[2:22:09] AnarchyMoose: i know people who just have wow and heartshone open all the time and they use wow to fund them playing HS lo
[2:22:10] RosieSeren: Its also good way to fight gold sellers
[2:22:33] mxfelwinter: yeah, there is a big peoblem with that logic, tali, someone have had to buy that gold from them thru the token, you sont produce wow tokens from thin air, blizz does for money
[2:22:34] d0mezg4mer: yeah just look at classic
[2:22:46] fat_european0: I remember the gold selling sites using corpses to type out their website as advertisement
[2:22:48] ebrahim_91: this month is a must purchase EVERYTHING kind of month lol
[2:22:55] AnarchyMoose: i wish i could just thanos snap all bots away forever Sadge
[2:23:01] Andy_Andreaa: i do think they should bring mage tower back and give custom appearances to the people who did it before
[2:23:04] netonkent: I played vanilla and everyone bought gold
[2:23:09] TheDeekins: trikWave
[2:23:09] MrScotticus: Have a great evening!
[2:23:10] frankenfoot5: What's for dinner?
[2:23:14] frankenfoot5: Have a great evening!
[2:23:16] Durwen: Remember to upload!
[2:23:17] d30xx: Take care!
[2:23:21] alextheblight: have a good one!
[2:23:23] kelsos86: have a nice evening :)
[2:23:24] RosieSeren: din dins
[2:23:25] KaosDevice: <3
[2:23:26] alextheblight: tneWineTime tneWineTime
[2:23:27] AnarchyMoose: its water!
[2:23:32] Thowarr: @netonkent The people who buy now, aren't buying the token
[2:23:35] alextheblight: byeee
[2:23:35] RosieSeren: thanks tali xx
[2:23:41] Trebled_Mind: cheerio!
[2:23:45] Rico_Azzarash: See ya bud. Was really nice to see you today <3
[2:23:58] pagan_pg: Let's go Raid Hazel
[2:23:59] AnarchyMoose: who uses their middle finger to scroll? thats weird
[2:24:13] pagan_pg: off to jdotb!
