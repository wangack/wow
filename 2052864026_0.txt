[0:57:41] mypovtm: he died on soak
[0:57:49] Chimix1: he needs to pop more then defensive
[0:57:52] yujik46: when he was already on 10% hp

[1:30:20] TheSemiDutch: @echo_esports what is a STAFORGE PC?
[1:30:32] 0_____Kappa: depends a bit if you get another shield when its almost dead
[1:30:46] IAmJoey: on average you get like 3 shields
[1:30:56] GingiTV: You want to do a lot of dmg outside the shield phase if you want to try and skip one phase
[1:30:59] 0_____Kappa: shields should take about 30s to clear on 27
[1:31:18] Smokeonetv: Hey Gingi
[1:31:27] GingiTV: heey
[1:31:32] Eliannoula: ellow gingi :D
[1:31:58] 0_____Kappa: the professional magician gamer is here monkaS
[1:33:22] 0_____Kappa: think you are close to getting 4 shields but maybe you can get it before #4
[1:33:37] 0_____Kappa: might depend on if you use lust now or at the end
[1:34:54] 0_____Kappa: gonna be real close on shield 4
[1:34:56] toboasd: Do you get any benefit from lusting on the burn phase?
[1:35:06] 0_____Kappa: only if you would otherwise fail it
[1:35:25] 0_____Kappa: actually dont remember if andys grp uses lust at the end or before
[1:35:35] 0_____Kappa: yodas grp mathed out using lust before to skip a shield
[1:35:38] 0_____Kappa: both on 31
[1:35:46] toboasd: I thought u already have all the haste so lust does nothing
[1:35:49] 0_____Kappa: so theoretically it should be overkill on 27
[1:36:02] 0_____Kappa: but you never know
[1:36:24] 0_____Kappa: @toboasd yeah true
[1:36:45] 0_____Kappa: I think the choice should be push boss faster or end a spooky shield faster
