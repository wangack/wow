[1:20:07] Zansteh: jrussLaugh
[1:20:23] SmokedHog: i'm ready for 9.1 tbh.... gonna be doing the new raid during.... .thanksgiving LUL
[1:20:57] capnkalland: As long as Blizzard doesn't put out TBC and 9.01
[1:21:16] Zansteh: its a chimaera
[1:21:23] Zansteh: or what is it called
[1:21:40] lanara233: true
[1:21:44] SmokedHog: dont be surprised... blizz might do it when new MMOs launch...
[1:21:48] Shrenko: TBC > 9.1
[1:21:56] S1appadabass: i mean, they did release naxx and shadowlands around the same time
[1:22:48] thikkrak: Having fun in classic?
[1:23:20] Kinghorn: its a big patroling chimera
[1:24:07] DallTV_: xD
[1:24:12] SmokedHog: they are going to make some $$ with the 58 boost
[1:24:21] satanic_viewer: how's covid in jersey? is it stabilized already?
[1:24:50] Multimon89: Well cause this is blizzard your talking about. And they pushed essences. Which killed the game.
[1:25:42] Kinghorn: mine was $9.99 and I said I was gonna clone 0, who wants to stay in classic TBC all the way baby
[1:25:51] TweakT: I feel it should cost $1
[1:25:56] TweakT: there are starving kids in Africa
[1:26:04] SmokedHog: i'd be ok with a $5 copy/paste
[1:26:13] Keyastaron_: you shouldnt have to pay to cpy yr character
[1:26:14] jiranu: do u really need to test all the way 60-70 i feel like ur smart enough to figure it out on the day
[1:26:16] Keyastaron_: IMO
[1:26:22] SmokedHog: I could see the boost going for 30-60
[1:26:45] MrGattz: boost will be the same price as it is for retail
[1:26:49] Terdnugget: i think you got credit?
[1:26:58] Bombayshow: MrGattz 70 bucks MonkaS
[1:27:08] d3admangaming: @Towelliee yo what time will you be playing outriders with Ted ?

[1:28:39] Sincline387: it's kind of like a server transfer though
[1:28:43] Sincline387: you get two toons
[1:28:53] NovaSun84: But wait, can you clarify that... I'm not allowed to play classic with my characters for free?
[1:28:54] Stonefather: You don't, cloning is for playing both
[1:28:55] khronick1904: Hey @towelliee do you think blizz will add WoW tokens to classic to help stop botting? or faction changes?
[1:28:56] MrGattz: i would really like the boost to be for like $39 they want to make it expensive enough so that not everyone does it.. but cheap enough to where some people that really really want to will still do it
[1:29:06] Sincline387: so you can choose to stay on classic for free
[1:29:12] SmokedHog: I wonder if TBC will live up to the hype
[1:29:12] Exonerae: Aren't you allowed to stay on classic for free?
[1:29:13] S1appadabass: i think cloning should be free
[1:29:14] Sincline387: if you want to go to both tyhats cloning
[1:29:35] Sincline387: no
[1:29:37] MrGattz: @Exonerae yes
[1:29:38] NovaSun84: This is dangerous to get wrong.  If I choose on TBC launch day to stay on classic, that is free right?
[1:29:42] ScytaleTv: Is the cloning for those that want to have the character in both?
[1:29:43] Exonerae: No, you stay on vanilla classic for free, can't progress to TBC
[1:29:48] Stonefather: You can either choose to stay on progression move to classic era or pay to go to both
[1:29:51] Sincline387: you choose when you log in which one you want to stay on for free, or both if you pay
[1:29:51] MrGattz: you can stay on classic for free. you can move to tbc for free.
[1:29:53] egraves7: yeah clone is for both, can stay for free
[1:29:56] Screamxan: U can go to classic era without paying. U have to pay if u want to clone ur character to both versions @Towelliee
[1:30:11] Keyastaron_: @Towelliee you cna go to BC and be IN CLASSIC just dont play BC contnet Kappa
[1:30:21] MrGattz: if you want to stay AND continue by doing a character copy you need to pay for it
[1:30:25] NovaSun84: Yea if I accept that I don't want TBC on my chars, that is free I thoguht
[1:30:34] Screamxan: yes
[1:30:35] Skaboy_TV: Skaboy_TV subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 10 months! Keep up the entertainment!
[1:30:37] Jermo11: yes
[1:30:51] Screamxan: u can choose 1 of the 2 for free and u have to pay if u want both.
[1:30:53] MrGattz: i mean... you shouldnt have to.. but its blizzard
[1:30:55] MrGattz: so
[1:30:57] SmokedHog: it'z blizz
[1:31:00] Clicklesly: Well, you're paying for your char to be on 2 servers
[1:31:05] Exonerae: Should you have to pay no? Can they get away with charging people for it, unfortunately.
[1:31:08] NovaSun84: Blizzard doesn't need to charge for it I agree... but cause its a character cloning maybe
[1:31:09] flyingmachin3: well its esentially boosting a character?
[1:31:10] MrGattz: you want fun? you gonna pay for it
[1:31:11] d3admangaming: When is the last time Blizz did anything for free
[1:31:14] carlos9949: WOW need to become Free to play
[1:31:20] desmo7: Why would they make it a paid service? That just kills vanilla servers
[1:31:26] MrGattz: @carlos9949 what are you smoking rofl
[1:31:28] PageFault74: blizz wants all the monies
[1:31:46] alfa_202: Isn't it cloning to TBC, how would you clone back to classic if your character is already over lvl 60
[1:31:47] Sincline387: @carlos9949 LOL no....please pay 9.99 to enable raid is not something I want
[1:31:48] MrGattz: no one wants wow to be free to play. it would be SWAMPED with bots
[1:31:51] MrGattz: more than it is already
[1:32:02] Exonerae: I have a feeling this is just going to split the community and they may both fail.
[1:32:08] Stonefather: Not even that, imagine the cash shop if WoW went to F2P you think it's bad now danKEK
[1:32:22] khronick1904: Hopefully they implement WoW tokens, sick of the gold bots and gdkp non sense. The economy on many servers are completely inflated. It sucks for us new returning players
[1:32:25] Shrenko: catJAM
[1:32:28] sphynx_rayne: @MrGattz yea the game would be unplayble lol
[1:32:31] SmokedHog: is the $30 sub to combat botters?
[1:32:31] NovaSun84: TBH if YOU(As a player) want a "fresh tbc server"... then start a new character and do it fresh LULW
[1:32:34] bruhSit_farmer: wow tokens dont stop bots
[1:32:38] bruhSit_farmer: look at retail
[1:32:42] Jermo11: yeah like 99%
[1:32:45] MrGattz: 98% of players will go to tbc
[1:32:45] Moobot: Towelliee is NOT moving or homeless. He is renovating his streaming room over the next month or so. The background will change, the stream will be scuffed, but it will be worth it! Soon™
[1:32:53] Screamxan: Only reason I'm gonna play is to level up my warlock in preperation for demonology warlocks in wotlk :)
[1:33:02] khronick1904: way more bots in classic than retail imo
[1:33:06] MetallicusGaming: kreyneron and to pay all their employees/ equipment/ servers etc
[1:33:10] MOLAR305: more people want to play TBC than those that stay and farm naxx40
[1:33:23] captain_steve_rogers: Blizz / Activis made money based calls its sad rather than fix retail they make classic and split the community and they are doing it again with classic tbc
[1:33:27] Exonerae: I agree that TBC is likely going to be more popular. RIP Vanilla classic.
[1:33:28] AlaskanStrat: Would that server just have the war mode option maybe ?
[1:33:30] NovaSun84: All my alliance players(4 level 60s), are staying Classic vanilla.  I'm going to TBC with my horde players in Towelliee's guild though and likely will continue there
[1:33:47] Sincline387: in the long run you'll have 2 maybe 3 servers, 1 for pve, 1 for pvp, and small chance for an rp server
[1:33:50] MrGattz: that sounds painful as hell
[1:34:05] bruhSit_farmer: yea fresh is best
[1:34:09] Screamxan: im down for season servers where u can earn rewards in forms of cosmetics, titles etc.
[1:34:11] Shrenko: it is painful as heell
[1:34:33] Broomba: starting fresh on a new ps vanilla server sounds like ones own hell
[1:34:35] Exonerae: Seasonal Classic is the only way it will survive
[1:34:48] captain_steve_rogers: Thorium drops the crystals for making the bars to forge Thunderfury

[1:35:03] NovaSun84: yeah... when BWL launched that was my most enjoyable content of Classic
[1:35:12] irWaffle: gummy @Towelliee
[1:35:13] MrGattz: @r0b928 new game published by square enix
[1:35:18] kandor_2: You actually played P-Servers Pog
[1:35:26] Broomba: lol
[1:35:37] TweakT: an uninformed dumbass makes a private server
[1:35:46] MrGattz: outriders is like diablo meets destiny 2 meets division had a baby with Anthem but its actually good with real end game content
[1:35:49] Screamxan: I would only play fresh classic if world buffs were removed entirely
[1:35:55] Kromede: i hope you can translate this https://mein-mmo.de/wow-provosten-neues-verbuendetes-volk/ leaked new allied race MiniK

[1:37:26] Kromede: who knows screamwoww Kappa
[1:37:32] NovaSun84: oh snap its past 9am for Outriders... is that delayed?
[1:37:32] Shrenko: @Towelliee you arent supposed to kill these. You loot the items at the bottom of the pit there
[1:37:50] Shrenko: its easly soloable
[1:38:12] Shrenko: theres not Sadge
[1:38:14] NovaSun84: The demo seemed enjoyable

[1:38:50] Miguel85NYC: Outriders is cool, not as good as Antheme imo
[1:38:54] TheGaoSora: F
[1:38:58] krulin_: F
[1:39:01] Broomba: thank god there was no twitch back in the 1980s when zelda was released so there was no major speed runs andys and spoilers
[1:39:09] Shrenko: ????
[1:39:28] MrGattz: anthem was really fun because it was flying. outriders actually has content but you cant even jump
[1:39:33] EggwithEdges: Anthem combat felt good to me, loot was boring tho
[1:39:35] MrGattz: soooo
[1:39:36] kandor_2: Thats like saying its not as good as burning trashcan LUL
[1:39:37] Alienfromger: LUL
[1:39:44] NovaSun84: I got a good 100 hours outta Anthem, I enjoyed the mechanics and the gameplay... it just lacked on retention and endgame
[1:39:48] TheGaoSora: You can't jump?? O.o;;
[1:40:05] Ysida: more like gears of war with rpg elements
[1:40:08] NovaSun84: Outriders seems really good on loot, which was a huge problem with Anthem... but to Anthem, I really liked the gameplay
[1:40:14] MrGattz: you can vault over things in outriders but you cant just jump at will
[1:40:14] Moobot: towHAMUP Follow Towelliee on twitter so you can be in the know at all times! | twitter.com/towelthetank towKawaii

[1:40:43] coachmcgrown: So what is outriders supposed to be?
[1:40:53] Alienfromger: its 90% division clone
[1:40:53] AureliusXV: im sure its doo doo
[1:40:56] saggyslays: 2 and a half hours until Outriders on PC! You and Sloot playing on release?
[1:41:04] DallTV_: is ppl still playing destiny 2 ? :p
[1:41:09] MrGattz: its not though
[1:41:20] MrGattz: its all the same type of game doesnt mean its a clone
[1:41:28] cbiskit89: looter shooter but with a talent tree system?
[1:41:43] cbiskit89: what makes it more like diablo than destiny?
[1:41:46] Miguel85NYC: outriders is a combination of gears of war and Destiny
[1:41:54] nodramajustpizzaa: @Towelliee what do you think of monks in retail right now
[1:42:29] MrGattz: @cbiskit89 i wouldnt say its more like diablo than anything. diablo only really influences the style of world progression. kinda like torments.

[2:48:56] project_logan: @MrGattz That was the vibe I got! Thank you!
[2:49:07] MrEvilRex: This game is giving me gears of wars vibes
[2:49:14] MrGattz: im really happy they dont have pvp. one less thing to worry about balancing that doesnt need to be there

[2:51:23] P1ght: @NVbrutal sad but true
[2:51:46] arturiuss44: So most comments have been Div 2, Destiny, Gears gameplay and Diablo type loot system so if you like any or all of those games then you may like this one.  If you dont like looter shooters then you wont like it.
