[3:53:11] sxlyons: SWIFTY PLEASE ANSWER ME
[3:53:27] Cowardpatty: Dragonflight sold less copies than Shadowlands
[3:53:33] OGSceneBoy: A custom classic would have been nice
[3:53:36] OGSceneBoy: With new content
[3:53:39] KodiakJedi: Blizzard confirmed that DF launch had a lot less people than Shadowlands
[3:53:46] lee_cifer: tbf.. i watch for the streamer.. not the game and WoW in particular is boring to watch imo
[3:53:47] Absolute_96: ye but Shadowlands was during covid @Cowardpatty
[3:53:49] StreamElements: Headset is Corsair Virtuoso https://cor.sr/Swifty
[3:54:13] KodiakJedi: But this was the first expansion after a bad Shadowlands and all the drama...so it was expected...but they have done a good job trying to rebuild that trust
[3:54:19] Cowardpatty: True. But I think the general consensus is that while Shadowlands started strong, it lacked content and turned people off, so less people were willing to buy DF
[3:54:26] Absolute_96: and assuming shadowlands had more hyped just because the lore and theme looked decent, while dragonflight is just dragons and no big threat
[3:54:38] Absolute_96: exactly
[3:54:40] KodiakJedi: @Cowardpatty 100%
[3:54:44] Cpmirel: WoW is older dirt, of course its going to start showing some age....i will still play till servers go down
[3:55:02] OGSceneBoy: Same with Cata, BFA, WoD
[3:55:05] Cpmirel: *older than dirt
[3:55:06] ryanblue98: legion had a cool theme
[3:55:08] OGSceneBoy: They all turned people off ha
[3:55:09] StreamElements: Redeem Points at point store https://streamelements.com/swifty/store
[3:55:10] miru_z: @Rwagorn Shadowlands and all the promo around it with the level squash and everything had a lot of people hyped
[3:55:11] KodiakJedi: I think if they ever modernize wow with a new engine it will bring a ton of life back into the game
[3:55:16] miru_z: then it ruined it all during the expansion
[3:55:18] OGSceneBoy: Legion was good yes
[3:55:18] Cowardpatty: I wonder how good SL would have been if covid wouldn't have hampered its development
[3:55:22] OGSceneBoy: It has the highest rating
[3:55:34] auroturtle: Swifty I think I saw u in south Tampa on Sunday
[3:55:44] BoricuaSJ: Well, when the most viewers (478K ) are just in the IRL, I think it is the dynamic of Twitch is changing.  It used to be about the games.. now its about.. who knows.
[3:55:50] StreamElements: Viewers and Subscribers generate points! You can redeem them at store for on screen effects! https://streamelements.com/swifty/store
[3:55:54] Absolute_96: same @Cowardpatty  but it still had bad systems
[3:55:58] OGSceneBoy: They finished Shadowlands pre covid
[3:56:05] OGSceneBoy: So COVID didnt hamper it
[3:56:07] Illander: @auroturtle you saw peanut i think
[3:56:10] miru_z: @Swifty  so what is your fav class this expansion
[3:56:13] dreamrunner98: yo man you are king swifty
[3:56:14] OGSceneBoy: They finish expansions 2 years ahead
[3:56:21] Cowardpatty: I meant from a content perspective
[3:56:39] Cpmirel: modernizing WoW will be the death of WoW....the type of rig you will need to run a graphically heavy WoW will kill accessibility
[3:56:39] StreamElements: Swifty is Partnered with Corsair! Click here to see all their cool stuff! https://cor.sr/Swifty
[3:57:09] OGSceneBoy: Dragonflight could have been better, but I think they did good developing it during COVID
[3:57:12] OGSceneBoy: Its def better then SL
[3:57:33] Slayer_Eagleone: SWIFTY if WoW dies will you mostly focus on vending machines?
[3:57:36] OGSceneBoy: Yeah its decent
[3:57:39] Reedy177: DF has been amazing for pvp imo
[3:57:42] Fatpowny: @GothStarz this
[3:57:48] Cowardpatty: It IS a good expansion IMO
[3:58:06] lee_cifer: i deleted my 413 rogue last week no regrets LUL
[3:58:29] miru_z: @lee_cifer Why? O_O
[3:58:33] noenken: DF has laid a lot of groundwork for the future.
[3:58:34] OGSceneBoy: I will always keep Legion as my top, but that was also like my WoW prime so it may just be subjective LUL

[3:59:05] lee_cifer: @lee_cifer just a huge waste of time.. i'm not willing to dedicate anymore time to it for mythic raids
[3:59:27] miru_z: MoP for as much hate as it gets was a phenomenal expansion in terms of gameplay.
[3:59:44] OGSceneBoy: MoP had good raids
[3:59:49] OGSceneBoy: At least to me
[3:59:59] StreamElements: Headset is Corsair Virtuoso https://cor.sr/Swifty

[4:02:27] OGSceneBoy: I was 8 years old in 2004, crazy man
[4:02:28] Slayer_Eagleone: SWIFTY if WoW dies will you mostly focus on vending machines? or arcades?
[4:02:33] Cpmirel: @OrkaneN the exploring was too "grindy" then they made it easy...then people consume the content so quick when its easy they get upset about it too

[4:05:01] OGSceneBoy: People are lazy now man, those times will never return sadly. I know there still is a community that enjoys old WoW, but the new kids dont like it @OrkaneN
