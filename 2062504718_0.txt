[0:13:32] ChrisarN: Horny as always, nothing new...
[0:13:33] illidari_Neeko: @mrgm What is it?
[0:13:48] ratgefingah: PowerUpL attack61Scream PowerUpR
[0:14:03] Demeternoth: horny? whose talking to me
[0:14:20] CerebrillUK: nice job not cracking up during the Manscaped ad read
[0:14:27] ratgefingah: you released a banger video, made me go back to the ww trailer and watch it frame by frame
[0:14:50] ratgefingah: fred again Pog
[0:14:55] MediumRareOG: "people" -> "one weirdo on twitter"
[0:15:31] ratgefingah: I think it was fine, we have a news drought rn and pre patch might be closer than you think
[0:15:37] CerebrillUK: QUITE a bit
[0:15:55] MediumRareOG: cunty mccuntface in the comments
[0:15:57] ratgefingah: the ad xdd
[0:16:51] ratgefingah: he propably felt left out cuz he has no balls to thank him
[0:16:58] death_cam_: did you see the wow token change for eu on wowhead?
[0:17:23] ratgefingah: I skipped to "your balls will thank you"
[0:17:44] lyreilla: Morning!
[0:18:02] ratgefingah: gz
[0:18:45] MightyBone_Yumuros: hello :)
[0:18:59] ratgefingah: has to be a big , right?
[0:19:01] MightyBone_Yumuros: it isn't confirmed yet
[0:19:09] MightyBone_Yumuros: might be jsut a bug
[0:19:11] s7wede: It's not a change, it's a bug since it's not confirmed
[0:19:12] ratgefingah: na and oce didnt change
[0:19:30] School_Toilets: The token tooltip only shows 30 days of gametime and not bnet balance
[0:19:38] ratgefingah: oh shit
[0:19:41] MightyBone_Yumuros: but also could be on enforcement of EU Law
[0:19:45] School_Toilets: It doesn't sound like a bug
[0:20:07] MightyBone_Yumuros: Remove the WoW Token Kappa
[0:20:09] ratgefingah: @MightyBone_Yumuros which one , I can only think of lootbox laws and thats only in belgium anyway
[0:20:43] sysimus: It's quite big change for in-game economy overall. Some big goblins (and bots) might retire, token pricemight go down, causing deflation etc. Interesting times.
[0:20:46] s7wede: If it's not a bug, They are going to have a LOT of legal issues. There was no warning or due diligence to make sure people knew this change was going to happen.
[0:21:08] School_Toilets: Geforce now is cloud gaming
[0:21:09] SlithTheSivak: i used it years ago and the latency was enough for me to not super enjoy it
[0:21:11] s7wede: It's fraud
[0:21:21] MediumRareOG: Google shut down their competitor to Geforce Now. It's actually a really limited idea. Input lag kills it
[0:21:41] SlithTheSivak: stadia
[0:21:44] MediumRareOG: Stadia
[0:21:45] MightyBone_Yumuros: @MightyBone_Yumuros there is currently a discussion in the EU Parlament on second currency due to concerns of money washing - it could also be a case it takes place in Games and they want to be careful here
[0:22:29] MediumRareOG: No stream yesterday and I didn't get the mount. Coincidence? I think not
[0:22:39] sysimus: It has, and using the token doesn't give two options anymore.
[0:23:16] MightyBone_Yumuros: 100 a law stuff
[0:23:18] illidari_Neeko: Didn‚Äôt you use to be able to redeem it for battle net currency? ü§îü§î
[0:24:12] MightyBone_Yumuros: as i wrote above there is a case in Eu Parlament in discussion on second currencies for quite a while
[0:24:12] ratgefingah: what if thats how they crack down on gold sellers(buyers
[0:24:59] MightyBone_Yumuros: would also be a good way
[0:25:29] ratgefingah: its time
[0:25:38] MightyBone_Yumuros: rocket inc

[0:26:02] School_Toilets: Manuscript is rarer than the mount
[0:26:02] MightyBone_Yumuros: likely in the range of the rocket
[0:26:13] ChrisarN: Started a Spriest on SoD! amazingly fun

[0:36:55] MightyBone_Yumuros: @MrGM Just heard Microsoft is going to announce something on the 15th could be in prep of that
[0:37:00] bwoods79: I see Naguura is cooking again, for Valentine's day.
[0:37:17] MightyBone_Yumuros: they didn't say it

[0:37:45] magemaster225: It's cause the Xbox isn't selling and they're putting games onto playstation
[0:37:46] MightyBone_Yumuros: Xbox Buisness Update
[0:37:58] wotsfortea: How is SoD I've not played at all is it too late to get into it?
[0:38:07] Big_Rum: What is GeForce now?
[0:38:11] MightyBone_Yumuros: and one point is the gamepass
[0:38:35] illidari_Neeko: @mrgm Can you imagine if they added WoW & Classic and you where able to download it onto steam and play via the Apple Vision Pro? üòÇ
[0:38:49] s7wede: I'm betting they are going to announce no more exclusives other than time gated for xbox studio games. It's time to kill that practice for good
[0:38:58] NeeK_23: go Dan hurt me, was it a relief to get the love rocket? I am losing hope this year
[0:39:01] bwoods79: I watched towellee do gnomer raid, didn't look too hard
[0:39:15] illidari_Neeko: Hey üëãüèº @neek_23
[0:39:50] NeeK_23: @illidari_Neeko mrgmHelloThere
[0:40:07] NeeK_23: a very famous mount too
[0:40:27] ChrisarN: One 1 person has ever gotten it, by mistake
[0:40:33] ChrisarN: back in the days
[0:40:33] Jokervenom1978: I saw the mount in IF last night. Its a flouresent green mechanostrider.
[0:41:25] Lythi: morning Dan!
[0:41:25] pricklefoxgaming: Hey mr GM random question and off topic, but what do you think midnight is going to be like and who do you think the last titan is?
[0:41:29] Karypto777: Crypto lol
[0:41:50] Layliah79: LUL
[0:42:02] RAF_Sean: Who is Al Bino?
[0:42:03] SlithTheSivak: my name still gives some trouble
[0:42:06] RAF_Sean: He a streamer?
[0:42:08] NeeK_23: is this an american thing when they think all the world speaks like them
[0:42:15] keyboardturner: it's actually pronounced alb-ayy-no :^)
[0:42:17] illidari_Neeko: To be honest we all have one word we can‚Äôt say üòÇ I can‚Äôt say Inventory
[0:42:18] Big_Rum: this may be unpopular opinion. But I am going to go ahead and say it now that we are at the end of dragonflight. Hands-down dragonfly is the best expansion World of Warcraft has ever came out with. It is the most well-rounded expansion, the leveling experience, PVP, dungeons, and raidsexceeded all other expansions.
[0:42:20] Layliah79: embarrassing for THEM!
[0:42:38] MightyBone_Yumuros: German pronnounce it like UK
[0:42:46] ChrisarN: Can you say my name again? English people struggle with it :p
[0:42:47] Layliah79: @Big_Rum 100% agree with you
[0:42:55] Layliah79: if you take out "classic" era
[0:43:11] SlithTheSivak: as a pvper, we got nothing this xpac
[0:43:17] RAF_Sean: I actually kind of agree with that statement. Wrath is my top dog forever but DF has been a real treat and I amde a ton of great friends/memories
[0:43:19] NeeK_23: the best expansion is the one when love rocket drops, so its war within for me....or midnight....or realistically Last Titian
[0:43:19] SlithTheSivak: best pvp gearing though
[0:43:23] Layliah79: pvp gear acquisition is in a good spot i think
[0:43:25] keyboardturner: I don't engage with PvP at all but i've heard it wasn't great, and I don't think pet battles got anything
[0:43:39] CerebrillUK: pvp is still fun but the mmr issues in solo shuffle is brutal especially for healers
[0:43:42] Lythi: balance wise, it's okay-ish, the gearing system is great to an extend. we¬¥ve certainly had worse expansions PvP wise
[0:43:50] s7wede: Dragonflight is good. But Legion during season 4 was a better feeling game. The systems had been fixed and were engaging. The story felt like we were doing something and the class balance was better in PVP
[0:44:03] Lythi: all good dude! cheers, yeah i¬¥m doing great
[0:44:14] CerebrillUK: @Lythi great job on AWC casting! you were great!
[0:44:14] keyboardturner: also we're missing a few of the "core returning features" we usually get for an expac - BFA Timewalking, MoP timewalking raid (maybe in pandemonium timerunning tho?), Brawler's Guild...
[0:44:28] SlithTheSivak: just a point of friction for me, IWIN buttons have been a joke since OG Alterac, they finally get put into the game and we cant use them in pvp...
[0:44:34] School_Toilets: Dragonflight is a QoL expansion and an open world testing ground
[0:44:40] Layliah79: best part of Dragonflight is their shift to evergreen features
[0:44:45] Lythi: @CerebrillUK tyty
[0:44:49] MightyBone_Yumuros: WoD had the last cool pvp imo.
[0:44:53] Arlaeya: Yeah PVP is kinda stalled at this point. But DF is definitely in the top three for me.
[0:44:56] SlithTheSivak: engineering item, IWIN buttons do 400k dmg...its a nuke
[0:45:00] MightyBone_Yumuros: only thing good about WoD was PvP
[0:45:06] RAF_Sean: I was playing a DH alt on EU yesterday and all I could think was how I wished there was an option to just auto complete all quests you've done on your account at max level
[0:45:13] Lythi: pvp?
[0:45:23] Lythi: items?
[0:45:34] keyboardturner: I think overall though it's definitely a banger compared to other expacs lol. It's pretty neutral on the story - some of it good, some of it okay-ish. It's still far exceeding WoD and systems-wise it's far more inviting than any other expac frankly
[0:45:48] RAF_Sean: Is that a WA that tells you the time to a flight point?
[0:45:53] Lausten: Was the love rocket drop first time of the day?
[0:46:07] RAF_Sean: I love it
[0:46:40] keyboardturner: area around the guy
[0:46:41] NeeK_23: the roped area
[0:46:43] MediumRareOG: I never believed Microsoft was abandoning Xbox
[0:47:28] RAF_Sean: The main campaign in DF wasn't special (it was good not great) but all the side quests and smaller NPC storylines were 10/10 (for me)
[0:47:33] keyboardturner: why would microsoft abandon xbox lol
[0:48:00] Layliah79: people can't doom on Activision anymore, so now it's MIcrosoft.
[0:48:01] RAF_Sean: I don't think they'll abandon Xbox but I do think they'll stop producing physical games
[0:48:19] keyboardturner: storytelling tools are immensely better by far
[0:48:24] RAF_Sean: That's totally fair yeah
[0:48:27] Layliah79: i agree
[0:48:34] emarol_dk: Bfa story was much better
[0:48:50] NeeK_23: it felt like a prologue, a palette cleanser to clean up lose ends
[0:48:51] keyboardturner: I think alexstrasza frankly fumbles the expac though sadly, I like her but she is not the "main character" who does "badass stuff" that players probably want
[0:48:52] Arlaeya: I loved a lot of the story. But I'm old and constant war is like.. meeeh for me. Ha!
[0:48:56] RAF_Sean: Couldn't agree more
[0:48:58] Lausten: Yeah hes far from alone
[0:49:06] Layliah79: it's not just one lonely guy lol
[0:49:07] Arlaeya: Totally agree on that
[0:49:18] SlithTheSivak: generally, overarching storylines are written by one person but the story beats are decided advance in committee
[0:49:20] RAF_Sean: He would likely have been the one with final sign off but no way he came up with all those terrible things on his own
[0:49:21] s7wede: He wasn't alone, but he was the person in charge
[0:49:25] Arlaeya: He's getting a lot of the flak for  things he had no control over
[0:49:54] RAF_Sean: I always felt like a lot of the real bad stuff was forced on him by Afrasiabi before he left/was sent off
[0:49:54] SlithTheSivak: story beats are collaborative, but like dialogue was typed out by one person
[0:50:00] Layliah79: think Chris is heavily involved in the story now?
[0:50:02] EmpathyLiveChat: It involves "jamming" apparently :)
[0:50:18] NeeK_23: I kinda hope they keep thinking that so that the team dont get targetted or singled out like he was. I cant be a fun life knowing people say that about you. IMO he handled it well, never lashed out or commented on it

[0:50:34] SlithTheSivak: you can only fit 1 person at a keyboard at a time...
[0:50:38] keyboardturner: almost the entirety of Sylvanas' arc was Afrasiabi forced upon the story team and they had to deal with the aftermath. She was supposed to die in SLs, and obviously they couldn't do that.
[0:51:27] keyboardturner: So basically SLs is damage control, kept her alive, but locked her away. Simultaneously made it so Arthas' story can never be brought back or "tainted"
[0:51:28] Zylthar: Sure its a collaborative process but he was the narrative leader so its still his responsibility.

[0:51:53] Arlaeya: @keyboardturner This, I just didn't want to look up Afrasiabi's name to remember how to spell it because eff him

[0:57:35] Lausten: Was it confirmed?
[0:58:06] Zylthar: Its speculated to be because of some anti money laundering EU law.

[0:58:54] SlithTheSivak: anything in the shop can be gifted
[0:59:02] magemaster225: P sure you can use it to buy stuff on the net store
[0:59:04] Zylthar: yeah with the bnet balance you could maybe buy keys or sell accounts with games on it perhaps? No clue tbh lol
[0:59:54] SlithTheSivak: the law is likely broad and deals w the exchange of goods for digital currency
[1:00:23] derjavanese: wait, what did they change witht the token?
[1:00:39] sysimus: After dumping blizzard balance, some speculations if blizzard games are moving to that xbox game pass,or if battle.net is gonna get more games. Either directions could be possible.
[1:01:12] MediumRareOG: my guess is some EU rule about in game currencies
[1:01:48] NeeK_23: could just be a bug thing. Odd to make this change without a followup blue post

[1:06:42] SlithTheSivak: Gloria Estefan
[1:06:48] RAF_Sean: I was in the washroom, what'd I miss?
[1:07:08] bojackhorseman2004: why was he mad?

[1:13:21] SirGrindsAl0t: tik tok doesnt make shit
[1:13:24] MediumRareOG: There's a Tiktok Creator Fund. It's not in every country
[1:13:34] SirGrindsAl0t: you would be better off with twitch and merch
[1:13:46] Wildsmasher: a lot of them do sponsorships

[1:16:20] s7wede: He doesn't say controversial stuff to stir controversy, he is just big enough to not give a fuck
[1:16:22] bojackhorseman2004: to get more views
[1:16:40] SlithTheSivak: he has a good support group of friends who also rely on him for business, so they're financially invested in asmons well being
[1:16:40] SirGrindsAl0t: say something controversal someone makes a video about him and he does a react and rinse and repeat

[1:22:23] SirGrindsAl0t: speaking of pancakes i would love to try a pancake sausage egg and cheese burrito Pog
[1:22:33] MediumRareOG: America is a super weird kind of Christian, like Good Friday and Easter aren't holidays here
[1:22:38] skewlbeta: well but you're not celebrating on Ash Wednesday. It's a day of fasting.
[1:22:53] SlithTheSivak: Shrive means ‚Äúto impose penance on (a sinner)‚Äù

[1:38:51] bojackhorseman2004: i feel like you cant be very posh with a name like "chessington"
[1:38:52] MediumRareOG: It varies though. "London" includes both Belgravia and Hackney
[1:38:52] NeeK_23: Harrogate

[1:39:03] Lausten: Thats the viking blood in the north Kappa
[1:39:27] bojackhorseman2004: Theme parks are the opposit of posh
[1:39:47] MediumRareOG: There's a viking buried in France named Rollo. Every European monarch is descended from him
[1:40:01] bojackhorseman2004: Menagery with exotic illegal animals would be very posh

[1:46:45] Wildsmasher: 40 wtf
[1:46:47] MediumRareOG: There's research on this. Money does buy happiness, up to like $75k a year. With inflation that's probably like $150k now
[1:47:06] illidari_Neeko: @lausten How did you know üòÇüòÇüòÇ Jk!
[1:47:30] s7wede: After that you hit diminishing returns until you hit the multiple millions
[1:47:35] skewlbeta: I think it's just whatever is up to covering your basic needs and allows you to have things that can enrich you
[1:47:52] MediumRareOG: If you're happy with your basic needs met, extra doesn't matter. If you're not, no amount of money will make you happy
[1:48:05] SlithTheSivak: for instance, i bought a sword with my covid stimulus check...
[1:48:07] skewlbeta: But there are plenty of people who have their needs covered and are miserable.

[1:49:54] MichaelLoda: @SlithTheSivak No, he showed that himself, and that doesn't make him depressed
[1:50:08] MichaelLoda: Maybe he doesn't want a maid
[1:50:17] SlithTheSivak: his house is a biological contamination zone

[1:51:54] headlocks000: @illidari_Neeko wild to think that some people don't enjoy FF that much
[1:52:10] MichaelLoda: The Sugar-free version I saw was very popular in UK
[1:52:50] NeeK_23: dont say that, theyll come for you LuL
[1:52:55] MediumRareOG: People who like FF14 are the same ones who want player housing in WoW
[1:53:04] MichaelLoda: I miss UK stuff Sadge Maryland biscuits, Cadbury, and Indian restaurants everywhere

[1:55:07] Vesamora: We found a good Indian restaurant where we live in Colorado. My boyfriend is a transplant from Newcastle and he's happy to finally have good Indian nearby.
[1:55:23] keyboardturner: as far as I'm aware it isn't fixed
[1:55:44] Lausten: An expat?
[1:55:47] MichaelLoda: Takeaways like jalfrezi or tikka masala is nice, but when restaurants have some authentic regional dishes, that's the good shit
[1:55:57] Arlaeya: It's daytime here (NA)
[1:55:58] MediumRareOG: I had a good Indian near me but then it closed. Obvious hate crime (against me)
[1:56:06] MichaelLoda: Doesn't have to be spicy
[1:56:12] bojackhorseman2004: I only eat in indian resturants where i seen other indians eat at before
[1:56:17] SirGrindsAl0t: its 920am here in florida
[1:56:21] MichaelLoda: Like when an indian restaurant has South Indian food, you know it's good
[1:56:38] databob1: @dennis410 it depends where you go there is a good Indian restaurant called Safran in Michigan it's really good
[1:56:45] Lausten: Expatriate: 'A person who lives outside their native country'
[1:56:49] Sydney_79: Hi there HeyGuys
[1:56:50] bojackhorseman2004: its legit the best indicator of good indian food
[1:56:55] StreamElements: What to Expect from the War Within Pre-Patch - https://youtu.be/-E_BeclbeNY
[1:57:02] SlithTheSivak: indian food is all over the place
[1:57:03] MediumRareOG: They randomly broke the BFA portal for Horde. Still not fixed. They broke Hunter pets. Still not fixed
[1:57:08] keyboardturner: there's some nice indian restaurants here, but they're hit or miss
[1:57:09] Sydney_79: doing fine thanks :)
[1:57:12] dright424: Indian is getting more popular here
[1:57:14] MichaelLoda: @bojackhorseman2004 True, always eat where the natives eat
[1:57:21] Dennis410: many indian restaurants in US use a lot of coloring agents. Canada and UK restaurants are a lot better

[1:57:28] Arlaeya: I live in NYC, it's more sit-down here than takeaway but we have a lot
[1:57:34] bojackhorseman2004: But i fucking love indian food, esp a bit spicy
[1:57:41] skewlbeta: I live pretty close to the indian hub by me. It's big enough to support a grocery store.
[1:57:46] MichaelLoda: @Dennis410 They use food colourings even in India really, but yeah it's bad
[1:58:00] SlithTheSivak: we have an indian bar near us that does chicken pacora bar snacks
[1:58:09] MediumRareOG: You can get great Indian food in Queens
[1:58:19] MichaelLoda: @bojackhorseman2004 My man, based
[1:58:21] Sydney_79: We have 1 Indian Restaurant in our very little town, it was awesome, but now its not anymore :(
[1:58:38] Sleepyjoegaming: my man !
[1:58:57] Sleepyjoegaming: full bis aswell :PPP
[1:58:57] MichaelLoda: I have only one here, I need to travel to the next city nearby

[1:59:10] Elrathir: Elrathir subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 33 months! hello gamers
[1:59:18] Dennis410: This cave showed up in my dreams last night where all Yetis were up!
[1:59:23] Sleepyjoegaming: well full raid ready anyway
[1:59:38] bojackhorseman2004: if an indian resturant servs chips, its a red flag to
[1:59:41] MichaelLoda: I love Indian food so much I'm practicing cooking at home with authentic ingredients and spices, starting to get good at it
[1:59:56] Sleepyjoegaming: bit of both as most of my bis is in SM
[1:59:57] MichaelLoda: Yes
[2:00:01] bojackhorseman2004: WutFace
[2:00:04] SlithTheSivak: butter chicken parmo
[2:00:15] MichaelLoda: @bojackhorseman2004 Yeah I'd never order chips
[2:00:16] DevoidX: indian with chips? typical northerner... ;)
[2:00:21] MediumRareOG: Chips with curry is a hate crime
[2:00:33] bojackhorseman2004: +
[2:00:34] Sleepyjoegaming: got to have chips and a maslasa
[2:00:41] Sleepyjoegaming: masala
[2:00:52] Sleepyjoegaming: blahh
[2:00:56] bojackhorseman2004: dont call it indian food, call it indianfusion
[2:00:57] SlithTheSivak: im a white garlic sauce on chips
[2:01:02] MediumRareOG: Minor hate crime
[2:01:18] MichaelLoda: "Curry sauce" is a British invention and an abomination
[2:01:32] Sydney_79: I got on a ignore-list in this cave, someone invited me, and i had to think if this makes sense, cause everyone needs 10 drops, and the droprate is shit...tried to explain...-.-
[2:01:39] MichaelLoda: "Curry" even means like 4 different things
[2:01:42] bojackhorseman2004: The only good british dish is a full english breakfest and the pies
[2:01:42] SlithTheSivak: cook from home!
[2:01:53] NeeK_23: @MichaelLoda the north agrees, curry sauce is not a thing here
[2:02:01] Sydney_79: i needed 10 yeti skins
[2:02:17] MichaelLoda: @bojackhorseman2004 Nah there's many more, don't fall into the Anti-British food propaganda on the internet

[2:02:27] keyboardturner: your nameplates make me think you're pvp flagged
[2:02:39] bojackhorseman2004: @MichaelLoda i am the one who propegates the propoganda
[2:02:39] DevoidX: when i was in india they said that 'curry' means gravy.
[2:02:42] NeeK_23: curry sauce is fairly rare up north
[2:02:45] illidari_Neeko: @neek_23 Liar! @mrgm
[2:02:48] SirGrindsAl0t: WutFace
[2:02:48] MichaelLoda: DansGame
[2:02:56] SlithTheSivak: this is true, i just got yelled at by my indian friend for calling curry sauce, curry. curry is a powder, they call curry sauce gravy in india...
[2:03:02] Sydney_79: people are so aggressive sometimes, got insulted for "stealing" a mob...and stuff like that
[2:03:28] MediumRareOG: what do they call gravy in India?
[2:03:35] DevoidX: @NeeK_23 where up north? cos' for sure in yorkshire it is a thing :)
[2:03:42] Sleepyjoegaming: if you see me running and you shoot your arrow past me we done being friends

[2:03:51] MediumRareOG: The yeti quest in Hillsbrad was always awful and often skipped
[2:04:00] s7wede: That change to the tag rules are probably the best QOL addition to retail wow. Now they just need to remove the faction chat restrictions
[2:04:05] Sydney_79: yes, i always invite or let me invited, but sometimes things go wrong
[2:04:09] Sleepyjoegaming: you know what i meen being a hunter to dan :P
[2:04:14] bojackhorseman2004: Curry littrarly means sauce, saying curry sauce is baisicly saying sauce sauce
[2:04:25] StreamElements: dracJAM TWITCH PRIME dracJAM
[2:04:27] MichaelLoda: Curry means: curry leaves, curry powder (spice mix), curry as a dish or type of dishes
[2:04:43] keyboardturner: guilds not being able to invite cross faction without being bnet friends is super annoying
[2:04:50] s7wede: The AH is already cross faction
[2:04:56] bojackhorseman2004: 1 thing i hope they change with cross faction guilds is increase the guild memeber limit 1000 is to little
[2:05:00] thunduz: good morning my dude. how‚Äôs SOD treating you
[2:05:02] bojackhorseman2004: cross region*
[2:05:20] Wildsmasher: cross region is coming to retail?
[2:05:22] bojackhorseman2004: I wanna be in a massive 10k m+ guild
[2:05:23] NeeK_23: crafting within guilds at a minimum needs to be cross server
[2:05:28] Wildsmasher: so i can play with my us friends
[2:05:32] MichaelLoda: @SlithTheSivak Both curry powder and curry as a dish/sauce was invented by Europeans, but even Indians started using those
[2:05:35] keyboardturner: they need to do something to add accounts that accomodate for alts, not just members
[2:05:40] keyboardturner: most 1k member guilds are alts
[2:05:41] thunduz: i just saw that! huge congrats!!!
[2:05:45] Lausten: @bojackhorseman2004 I would love it if they made it accounts instead of characters
[2:05:49] Sydney_79: Wooohooo congratz to the rocket!
[2:06:10] Sleepyjoegaming: congratz on mount my man
[2:06:13] bwoods79: Imagine if they had let that guild perk stay in the game where the guild got a % of the gold you loots
[2:06:17] NeeK_23: bnet communities are annoying since its per character not per account
[2:06:20] bojackhorseman2004: but with stuff like these you never know if blizzard is stupid or if it is a technical issue
[2:06:20] MichaelLoda: Grats on rocket! I got it too few days ago, hell yeah
[2:06:27] MediumRareOG: i have 70 toons at this point. that's a huge chunk of 1000 slots in a guild
[2:06:27] SlithTheSivak: @MichaelLoda bold to suggest people in India didnt use a spice grown in their own country until British people showed up lol
[2:07:17] MediumRareOG: Have you tried naming toons? My last evoker was called "juicebox"
[2:07:20] MyNameIsWhat4: Took a break from sod to grind out spirit of eche‚Äôro, god I hate archaeology
[2:07:37] bojackhorseman2004: I am calling it, the AH will break the server when/if they make it cross region
[2:07:42] MyNameIsWhat4: 3. hours later lol
[2:07:45] MyNameIsWhat4: Ty lol
[2:07:49] Lausten: Wouldnt mind not having to have 2 accounts and "sniping" auctions from different servers all over EU
[2:08:12] MichaelLoda: @SlithTheSivak No, I didn't say that, of course they did. But the British came up with "Madras curry powder", now popularly used as a one-for-all curry spice mix, but authentic Indian food has their own spices
[2:08:16] bwoods79: I remember spending coutless days/ hours trying to get vial of sands recipe. I took a break from it for about a month, came back and got it on my first drop
[2:08:48] MichaelLoda: They started calling it "curry" but the name comes form a Tamil word for the curry leaves, which is ironic because it's not often used in Indian restaurants in UK
[2:08:58] MediumRareOG: I think it'll make things less sellable
[2:09:10] bojackhorseman2004: cant you just send it to the appropiate armour type?
[2:09:16] bojackhorseman2004: after buying it
[2:09:24] bojackhorseman2004: like an alt
[2:09:50] havoom01: imagine to wear plate as warlock
[2:10:00] keyboardturner: you can't explain basic things to people who refuse to read
[2:10:26] WitchiMurloc: or listen iguess
[2:10:33] NeeK_23: i pity the future of the human race sometimes when reading social media comments
[2:11:11] SirGrindsAl0t: D:
[2:11:41] MichaelLoda: LET'S GOO, CAN'T WAIT FOR THIS
[2:11:48] MichaelLoda: Revolution for transmog farming!
[2:11:51] bojackhorseman2004: ?? I DONT WANNA WEAR PLATE ON MY WARLOCK!
[2:11:54] Onisekai: does it mean weapon too or just armor?
[2:11:58] SirGrindsAl0t: we know what transmog is they just misunderstood what you meant
[2:12:00] bomayaa: I understood what you meant and I don't do transmog
[2:12:11] SirGrindsAl0t: now if you said gear than i would of agreed
[2:12:25] keyboardturner: don't tell me how to play my class dan
[2:12:26] bojackhorseman2004: You have to show the comments that where confused
[2:12:35] bojackhorseman2004: if its like 1 downvoted comment it dosnt count
[2:12:35] NeeK_23: I do want to wear plate on my warlock and now I'm mad
[2:13:05] bojackhorseman2004: if the top comment is somone being confused, then alarm bells should ring
[2:13:12] MediumRareOG: add "listen you little freaks. i'm not saying cloth users can wear plate transmogs. shut up"
[2:13:14] s7wede: It's people not listening to what you are saying, only reacting to what they think you said. Comments like that are worthless and should just be removed

[2:14:02] MichaelLoda: I just want to wear a 1H weapon and shield as Retribution. There's so many good 1H swords...
[2:14:07] bojackhorseman2004: the first one
[2:14:10] bojackhorseman2004: this one is stupid

[2:14:26] MediumRareOG: at least the first guy asked a question. that's fine. the second was just confidently wrong
[2:14:29] MichaelLoda: I'd wear plate on a warlock tbh. Or even cloth on paladin
[2:14:41] SirGrindsAl0t: the heritage set for orc Kreygasm
[2:14:46] Akela3: i think there's a reasonable chance that 2nd person knows that isn't the way it will work and is just being a troll
[2:15:11] MichaelLoda: #AbolishArmourTypes
[2:15:16] bojackhorseman2004: with modern wow, tbh i cant see the diffrence from different armoru types most of the times
[2:15:28] SirGrindsAl0t: why not D:
[2:15:28] MediumRareOG: In Classic, it was cloth that had +int so paladins, who can wear plate, wore cloth when they were heal spec. I liked that
[2:15:39] Akela3: if you want to wear the wrong armor type for your class, just play classic
[2:15:50] MichaelLoda: Mail on Paladins in Classic hell yeah
[2:16:03] MediumRareOG: hulking mountain lions are in the hills above
[2:16:09] zafearce: Ok but what if equiping different armor types changed speed and other stats
[2:16:09] bwoods79: I wonder if they will open it up to where you can get tier token pieces for other classes and trade those in to collect the transmog
[2:16:13] MichaelLoda: I'm so behind in Classic, level 30, and have no will to continue anymore, I think I'll just give up and return to Retail
[2:16:25] MediumRareOG: where the defias camps are
[2:16:39] bojackhorseman2004: I REALLY! hope we have to go back to our class halls to unlock the hero talents, since they are class thematic
[2:16:53] bojackhorseman2004: i miss the class halls so much
[2:17:00] NeeK_23: cries in evoker

[2:17:25] bojackhorseman2004: or just stand around deathwings jaw in stormwind
[2:17:29] dright424: I think they said some tier will not be cross collectable due to the token
[2:17:40] SirGrindsAl0t: deathwing Pog
[2:18:08] bojackhorseman2004: Wait, can you get the achivement from being burned by deathwing as an evoker?
[2:18:09] bojackhorseman2004: that be pog
[2:18:11] Lausten: @dright424 They could just make the tokens boe and be done with it
[2:18:20] NeeK_23: yup
[2:18:21] Haestoh: Goooooooooooooood afternoon fellow SoD enjoyers.
[2:18:23] NeeK_23: I did

[2:18:39] keyboardturner: let me try
[2:18:39] MichaelLoda: 5Head
[2:18:44] MediumRareOG: all they need to do is to make the tier gear from tokens BoA instead of BoP
[2:19:11] NeeK_23: I think it could by radius, but the depth idk
[2:19:19] Arlaeya: I'm glad I'm not the only one who thinks that every time I fly over old Dal

[2:23:34] Akela3: they put the dome over the ruined city after archimonde destroyed it
[2:23:38] keyboardturner: it was attacked by the scourge
[2:23:42] Sleepyjoegaming: what i know dalaran protected it self from the lichking
[2:23:43] keyboardturner: / legion
[2:23:43] MichaelLoda: Oh is that true that you don't have Ahmad Tea in Britain? Or it's not that popular?
[2:23:44] NeeK_23: Dalaran was destroyed by Archemode
[2:23:49] Akela3: while they rebuild it
[2:23:53] SlithTheSivak: theres a sweet cinematic of archimonde destroying it
[2:23:59] bwoods79: big question is...where with Dalaran move to next?
[2:24:01] SirGrindsAl0t: what gap Kappa
[2:24:21] s7wede: Yeah from WC3 days
[2:24:24] NeeK_23: he makes the city with sand then knocks it down
[2:24:25] MichaelLoda: It's an English tea brand, I guess they export more to other countries
[2:24:33] Arlaeya: If you click on Dadgar in DF enough times he says he can't remember where he left Dal, lol
[2:24:34] keyboardturner: 3.0? Pog
[2:24:47] MichaelLoda: I was recently buying tea and was choosing between Ahmad and Twinnings, I thought both are popular there
[2:25:05] havoom01: wasnt dalaran protected by an magical barrier and u have to kill antonidas as arthas in WC3
[2:25:23] keyboardturner: different barrier
[2:25:31] keyboardturner: was part of a mission but not the same one
[2:25:34] MichaelLoda: Interesting
[2:25:42] havoom01: ah okie

[2:29:17] NeeK_23: I read Tetley is having a UK shortage of tea
[2:29:35] MichaelLoda: I need to search for those here, thanks

[2:30:41] bojackhorseman2004: problem with that is that guides are very spesific content and shorts are meant for mass appeal
[2:30:43] SirGrindsAl0t: do it Pog
[2:30:46] Layliah79: think they sound great!

[2:31:19] bojackhorseman2004: people look up guides, shorts just come up after you scroll
[2:31:41] SirGrindsAl0t: guides with a bunch of rambling ResidentSleeper
[2:32:12] bwoods79: With the youtube shorts more people are doing "parts", that makes people want to go to your other content to see the other parts
[2:32:14] SirGrindsAl0t: just do a quick straight to the point guide and you will be golden and seperate yourself from the rest
[2:32:37] keyboardturner: that's the orb and crater lol
[2:32:38] Sydney_79: Your sleeping-bag buff has expired
[2:32:52] keyboardturner: under the orb

[2:34:10] bwoods79: I love how people end the short so you don't realize it looped and started over again
[2:34:14] bojackhorseman2004: Ask yourself this, if you where mindlessly scrolling shorts, do you want to see a guide of somthing you arent intrested in farming?
[2:34:25] StreamElements: dracJAM TWITCH PRIME dracJAM
[2:34:41] bojackhorseman2004: and how many people who are intrested in farming somthing wouldnt just look it up?
[2:34:44] bojackhorseman2004: on wowhead or youtube
[2:34:55] StreamElements: Click on my link www.hellofresh.co.uk/MRGM and order your Box for less than ¬£4 per meal!
[2:35:05] MediumRareOG: @bojackhorseman2004 That's a silly question. Like I watch Tiktoks about life in Honduras. Do I live in Honduras? No. Am I planning to? No. Am I curious? Apparently, yes
[2:35:08] Sleepyjoegaming: mounts and trnsmog some people dont go through there lists people want fast and easy
[2:35:13] NeeK_23: how would you know it exists to look up
[2:35:16] bojackhorseman2004: then wouldnt a showcase of cool stuff be more intresting?
[2:35:22] Sleepyjoegaming: the guide wil provide an easy step by step
[2:35:22] bojackhorseman2004: then guides on your channel to funnel those people to ur channel
[2:35:22] illidari_Neeko: @bojackhorseman2004 It doesn‚Äôt matter! A short video like that is very informative!
[2:35:26] Sleepyjoegaming: think it would be great
[2:35:48] Sydney_79: you left the sleeping bag to early :(
[2:36:03] MediumRareOG: NA down for some reason. I thought we were meant to be able to keep playing. Apparently not
[2:36:05] Sydney_79: is it still there?

[2:36:56] Sleepyjoegaming: ive got one if you need it

[2:37:47] MichaelLoda: TikTok-like content ruined the internet tbh
[2:37:52] S3N71: See who is online and has a bag off cooldown, ask them to invite you to party and jump in their bag
[2:38:01] SirGrindsAl0t: Pog
[2:38:02] MichaelLoda: KKomrade
[2:38:13] NeeK_23: doing what everyone does, means its crowded. Maybe there is demand for the content but its not been made yet
[2:38:15] MichaelLoda: Logan WutFace
[2:38:42] SirGrindsAl0t: its true what they say about wow being addictive af
[2:38:52] Sery_Bot: The ad break is finishing now! seryboLove

[2:40:13] Lausten: @MichaelLoda Its so long
[2:40:16] SirGrindsAl0t: ^^^^
[2:40:16] MichaelLoda: You know the game is fun when you hate it and still play it 10 hours a day
[2:40:21] MichaelLoda: @snagprophet hell yeah
[2:40:28] SirGrindsAl0t: any game period
[2:40:34] SirGrindsAl0t: in my opinion
[2:40:35] WitchiMurloc: also things just take a long time to do so it takes up a lot of time
[2:40:42] MichaelLoda: @Lausten It will be 2 hours 15 minutes, longest TGT special
[2:40:42] s7wede: Wildstar was pretty good as well.
[2:40:43] Sydney_79: There is no other game i like to play that much, over and over again, loved GTA Vice City, Hogwarts Legacy, but not motivated to play over again
[2:40:45] NeeK_23: best button feel, just pressing buttons feels better and more impactful
[2:40:54] keyboardturner: i can make some mods in skyrim to make movement a tiiiiny bit better, but not even skyrim can i mod in dragonriding proper
[2:41:00] illidari_Neeko: There is something for everyone‚Ä¶If you don‚Äôt like Raiding there is PVP or Dungeons, mount collecting pet collecting or fishing even! üòÇ
[2:41:13] bojackhorseman2004: are links allowed? you can sort by world of warcraft popularity shorts
[2:41:16] Lausten: @MichaelLoda Was just referring to the train :D
[2:41:19] Layliah79: it's so vast
[2:41:21] MichaelLoda: Skyrim has terrible camera and movement. WoW ruined for me all other games
[2:41:24] SirGrindsAl0t: pet battles Kreygasm

[2:43:43] illidari_Neeko: @bojackhorseman2004 I don‚Äôt see it üôÉ
[2:44:14] Lausten: Shower thought, is the sleeping bag an item that you place down in the world and it stays there? How does that work in wow? I was thinking player housing..
[2:44:28] MichaelLoda: I love WoW movement and camera and overall the game and UI engine, I've got to know it thoroughly, I'm familiar with all the little quirks, it makes me love it more
[2:44:42] bojackhorseman2004: I am seeing it, just frustrating it resets when i link it.
[2:44:48] bojackhorseman2004: but who cares
[2:44:50] illidari_Neeko: Unpopular Opinion, F1 starts again at the end of Feb‚Ä¶Just saying üòÇ
[2:44:53] MichaelLoda: I don't have any keybind available for the Pings so can't use them LUL
[2:45:13] Layliah79: so when it turned to night on live servers during the day yesterday, it also happened on PTR. people were speculating that it might berelate to 10.2.6, and captain Dreadsquall - who sailed to Pandaria BEFORE it was uncovered, and around Azeroth.
[2:45:38] MichaelLoda: Casuals smh...
[2:45:40] lord_hanmint: Its not hard to play wow without addons
[2:45:51] Layliah79: I think so too KEKW
[2:46:04] Layliah79: it's great tho how not telling us anything about the patch has people's minds going.
[2:46:07] MichaelLoda: It is, I can't play without ATT, Bagnon, other stuff...
[2:46:09] Lausten: Without ATT I wouldnt play though
[2:46:23] MichaelLoda: @Layliah79 I'm so excited
[2:46:41] Layliah79: @MichaelLoda same!

[3:03:14] Travnar: there's also prob some technical changes required for it
[3:03:35] Travnar: ah didnt know that
[3:03:41] WolfSpirit80: I wish Twitch would seperate SoD from retail in their categories
[3:04:08] Travnar: i agree, and even in retail the discrepancy of old vs new models is one of the worst things about the graphics atm.
[3:04:15] moriartiphd: I think khadgar was not changeable in wod
[3:04:20] Akela3: i could argue that new models are a step too far for classic
[3:04:25] StreamElements: dracJAM TWITCH PRIME dracJAM
[3:04:25] illidari_Neeko: Fine as is I would say‚Ä¶
[3:04:32] opaka80: keep it classic
[3:05:12] Sindragozer: well khadgar used to look very different
[3:05:27] lord_hanmint: the old model of khadgar was scary lmfao
[3:05:29] JBonezey: Dan what addon is the Dragonflight look?
[3:05:40] Goblocker: Khadgar looked a lot better when he got a shave
[3:05:47] JBonezey: Thanks Mate
[3:05:53] lord_hanmint: and he got aged by medivh
[3:05:54] moriartiphd: Like khadgar is the main guide character in wod.  He is just a a side character before
[3:06:11] Sindragozer: the Clooney curse
[3:06:13] keyboardturner: he is "cursed" (artificially aged by fel), and that he "seemed younger" after the shave but he isn't actually younger, just appearance-wise he looked it
[3:06:32] JBonezey: press shift v
[3:06:36] yuldovah42: your not in pvp
[3:06:42] JBonezey: hmm
[3:06:55] JBonezey: oh yeah, if you aren't in pvp, they dont come up, thats right
[3:07:25] Sindragozer: well at least that turtle made it to the water
[3:07:29] yuldovah42: they are just frendily until pvp or SV event
[3:07:45] Sindragozer: well... the cycle of life can be cruel, as they say
[3:08:15] Akela3: what nameplate addon are you using? i haven't found one that i like for classic
[3:08:36] moriartiphd: Khadgar's whiskers, the herb, don't make sense with the new khadgar model.
[3:08:55] Akela3: do you mind sharing the name of the plater profile you're using?
[3:09:05] Lausten: They only exist cause he shaved Kappa

[3:53:35] neverbornlucky: yes and there is also a variant of him as iron lad young avengers team
[3:53:43] NeeK_23: if anything, it cant make less sense than Madame Web, a spiderman movie with no mention of Spiderman
[3:54:07] thunduz: Madam Web looks like it's supposed to be terrible
[3:54:08] dastago: i really don't pull another thing like elementals of "actually these guys were behind everything all along!" shadowlands style
[3:54:17] neverbornlucky: to be fair Madam Web is sony not disney
[3:54:27] thereal_stmarie: that's a cinematic abortion
[3:54:48] Mystikora: yeah she did not like her at all
[3:54:52] Mystikora: like the movie**

[3:55:58] Mystikora: i think
[3:55:59] moriartiphd: The 50 shades main character
[3:56:09] thunduz: He gets bite by a lion and can talk to animals lol

[4:15:09] chelfx: d3 did idk about d4
[4:15:18] Sindragozer: ya it does
[4:16:06] Eran_: Hello fellaz, just wondering, does anyone know whether durotar logistics gives some new good rewards in p2?
[4:16:06] Mystikora: lol
[4:16:09] Mystikora: youngling
[4:16:16] chelfx: i would also maybe think wow has too many achievements
[4:17:05] Iwony: got the game but never reached 100 on any< char... it just got boring very fast
[4:17:07] Mystikora: all the negative reviews xD
[4:17:12] dastago: diablo iv is a weird one. people were hyping it so much at launch now people don't seem to give a shit or even feel negatively about it
[4:17:23] chelfx: i wonder how many those have play time

[4:17:31] alextheblight: imagine what WoW's would look like
[4:17:39] SirBarracuda: I would imagine existing accounts wouldn't transfer to the Steam Launcher, inc achis. Guild Wars 2 move to Steam was for new accounts only
[4:18:03] keyboardturner: WoW players reviewing something positively? lol
[4:18:04] illidari_Neeko: WoW üëçüèº Overwatch üëé
[4:18:27] alextheblight: some reviews would also fluctuate between positive and negative per patch
[4:18:31] Lausten: Who cares about reveiws anyways? We play wow cause were addiced not cause we like it Kappa
[4:18:34] Sindragozer: d4 has cross platform accounts with xbox/pc
[4:18:36] alextheblight: the same reviews*
[4:18:37] Dopefishy: !watchtime
[4:18:48] Mystikora: @Lausten too real XD
[4:19:25] chelfx: it is
[4:19:51] chelfx: its also on Ubisoft Connect lol
[4:20:01] thunduz: mrgmZ mrgmThis mrgmThis mrgmThis he's gonna stream it fam!
[4:20:10] Prycey: ff14 is also on ps4/ps5 and base game and first 2 expansions are free
[4:20:25] alextheblight: true
[4:20:26] BeUnseen: Its a great story game if youve never experienced it. A lot less to do then in WoW but not necessarily in a bad way
[4:20:29] chelfx: I still dont think wow will come to console
[4:20:31] thunduz: 100%
[4:20:33] chelfx: but steam yes
[4:20:37] illidari_Neeko: Well clearly they haven‚Äôt played WoW
[4:20:39] dastago: i hope so
[4:20:42] alextheblight: announcement next blizzcon
[4:20:45] Mystikora: i think so as well
[4:20:48] thunduz: hot take
[4:20:48] alextheblight: 100%
[4:20:59] chelfx: it will be on This week on wow
[4:21:21] Prycey: will prob end up on game pass as well now Xbox took over
[4:21:25] chelfx: devs saying how life-changing moving the to steam
[4:21:32] zantos2020: I can see it on GamePass but not STeam
[4:21:50] chelfx: @zantos2020 ESO isnt on gamepass for PC
[4:21:56] chelfx: i dont see wow doing it
[4:22:01] Prycey: @zantos2020 xbox will more than likely put it on steam and gamepass
[4:22:15] alextheblight: the wow twitter account would probable make a post with some steam pun
[4:22:27] alextheblight: that's how they'll announce it
[4:22:35] chelfx: Second we see wow on gamepass is the day the subs have gone to the shitter
[4:22:41] zantos2020: and GamePass already has the cloud play
[4:22:53] bomayaa: oh that inn, that brings back memories
[4:23:00] Prycey: @MrGM Microsofts thing is putting game on every platform they can so steam and gamepass isn't a stretch for them
[4:23:01] chelfx: Xbox cloud is console atm
[4:23:05] chelfx: its not PC cloud
[4:23:15] Heret3k: How often do you play WoW on steam deck?
[4:23:28] illidari_Neeko: Wow Subscription included as Battle Pass? üßê
[4:23:30] zantos2020: GamePass cloud is on PC, just not all games
[4:23:32] chelfx: You can play it on PC but its the Xbox version of the game
[4:23:56] chelfx: @zantos2020 Xbox version of the game thats wahat i was trying to say
[4:24:04] Prycey: @chelfx cloud is available for certain games on pc gamepass but not all
[4:24:27] chelfx: @Prycey see previous comment
[4:25:22] Lausten: Always wondered what made those lifts work

[4:28:54] Layliah79: i feel like the wow news is going to be super boring until 10.2.6 is released.
[4:29:24] Layliah79: prob the week after that event ends IMO
[4:29:29] chelfx: march 26th
[4:29:30] S3N71: I think 26th, because there is a 2 and a 6 in the date
[4:29:35] snagprophet: like they launch retail and classic updates seperately?
[4:30:13] chelfx: i think its just for retail but they want to try to push classic players to play it
[4:30:21] Layliah79: either date - we still have over a month until then :(
[4:31:15] zantos2020: Do you think they'll announce 10.2.6 or will it just be a Tuesday morning surprise?
[4:32:25] skewlbeta: I mean I hope it's 3/19 as it's my birthday but 3/26 just feels more likely
[4:32:50] dright424: Cata beta and Solo self found could both come out this month
[4:33:09] chelfx: is like the trading post
[4:33:18] dright424: It will probably be level agnostic
[4:33:21] Layliah79: must be done from original horde/alliance cities
[4:34:02] dastago: in my head i know it won't be player housing but i really want it to be
[4:34:03] Layliah79: at least with the Trading Post we got hints for months with the npcs there "building"
[4:34:25] StreamElements: dracJAM TWITCH PRIME dracJAM
[4:34:31] keyboardturner: modCheck
[4:34:35] Layliah79: pirate survival!!
[4:34:39] chelfx: i do like the idea of game in a game idea
[4:34:40] BeUnseen: its 100% without a doubt in my mind a pirates themed vampire survivors game mode
[4:34:42] dastago: the flag thing would be weird if it wasn;t
[4:34:50] skewlbeta: WW alpha is going to be april then probably
[4:35:18] dright424: I think it will be some kind of pirate themed survival mode with pve and pvp options
[4:35:31] Layliah79: feel like player housing would be an expansion feature? right?
[4:35:58] chelfx: i thought follower dngs would be the that as well
[4:36:03] chelfx: but it awas 2.5 patch
[4:36:12] dastago: they're really hyping it tho so it's gotta be something cool surely?
[4:36:16] Sindragozer: how about a survival mode where you have your battle pets build all of your machines
[4:36:30] Layliah79: i just want whatever type of event it is to have cool cosmetics. but they would have to be both classic and retail cosmetics
[4:36:41] Sindragozer: ya lol
[4:36:54] Layliah79: they were listening to us!
[4:37:12] skewlbeta: for the mythic + probably?
[4:37:14] Layliah79: do the MDI each season just for the toy lol

[4:38:08] BeUnseen: learning from hurricane videos pog
[4:38:09] skewlbeta: oh no video of getting bounced back to the front after failing to run throuhg the balls? Unrealistic smh

[4:38:38] Iam_Swiggles: Max lvl is 40 now?
[4:39:46] Iam_Swiggles: Is sod any good I haven't tried it yet
[4:40:18] Thelothian: Hi @MrGM as i written on discord, for me the timetable is different; starting from 10.2.6 6 March, Season 4 20 March/ 3 April... the TWW Alpha 13 March. Most likely I won't be right, but I'll try to imagine this timeline :)
[4:40:34] Layliah79: yes esp since you're on foot most of the time
[4:40:50] Iam_Swiggles: Agreed I don't play retail anymore. I haven't been on wow in a few months tho
[4:41:05] Layliah79: i don't think S4 will be in March at all. we need PTR raid testing.
[4:41:07] Mystikora: what was the healthbar addon you had ? i need to get it myself
[4:41:14] skewlbeta: hmmm
[4:41:19] Thelothian: maybe Alpha date is too much optimistic
[4:41:24] skewlbeta: is it MrNDA hours?
[4:41:28] Mystikora: yeah your frame health
[4:41:32] Layliah79: Still waiting for BFA Timewalking FeelsStrongMan
[4:41:45] chelfx: blink twice if you played TWW
[4:42:02] Layliah79: I <3 Islands!
[4:42:18] mikael_jansson90: he blinked twice
[4:42:26] skewlbeta: soon tho
[4:42:28] Mystikora: cause i only have unitframes improved, and i dont like that one
[4:42:35] mikael_jansson90: sus
[4:42:38] Layliah79: my eyes always dry from my contacts
[4:43:02] Layliah79: not all of them have the heart for the game like you do

[4:46:23] Sindragozer: the water made it to the turtle. its beautiful
[4:47:51] DevoidX: i remember back in vanilla there were rumours of actual racing there being developed. dont recall it ever happening

[5:06:26] Sindragozer: @Shocklate_ Pog gz
[5:06:36] Greatmatt1: Welcome to club Old!
[5:06:50] dastago: i'm 23 and i don't get it either
[5:06:53] Layliah79: it's a bit childish IMO
[5:07:08] skewlbeta: The funniest moments are the organic ones. Max's thing about young dip hitting the skip is an absolute meme
[5:07:25] Layliah79: Yes!! Echo was great
[5:07:27] chelfx: echo is really fun
[5:09:03] breninn3: It's something I'd watch again, but as long as preach isn't a commentator on any of it
[5:09:22] chelfx: preach  was the best part
[5:09:28] Mystikora: well its time for dinner for me ! have a good rest of stream :)
[5:09:28] Prycey: preach is great wtf you on about
[5:09:50] breninn3: It's an unpopular opinion I get it, I've just never enjoyed any of his content

[5:13:00] Sindragozer: a 7 spellpower wand
[5:13:25] Sindragozer: ya it has 2 and 3 rares
[5:13:38] Layliah79: being able to transmog your gear would be great in Season of Mastery.. just saying
[5:13:49] Sindragozer: one boss is just in the first room and could be mistaken for a trash mob
[5:13:59] Layliah79: LOL
[5:14:16] Layliah79: i didn't start playing till Wrath so maybe i see it diff
[5:14:19] chelfx: Calender
[5:14:29] Layliah79: wait there was no barbershop back then?
[5:14:41] dastago: yeah i really don't like no barbershop
[5:14:46] Prycey: we only need transmog in retail is cus unless your a warlock or priest all the sets look shit
[5:15:12] Layliah79: now in modern you can change everything including your sex!
[5:15:28] chelfx: @Layliah79 you can do that in wrath calssic too
[5:15:32] Prycey: yeah that why i said unless as they are the only good sets
[5:15:35] breninn3: I think anything that doesn't impact the actual gameplay should be implemented. Transmog, Calendar, and Barbershop don't have any downsides so why not
[5:15:47] Sindragozer: yea i want me some dualspec
[5:16:07] ahux_: just be able to change your spec whenever for free, why put it behind a ingame pay wall
[5:16:16] chelfx: or even free respecs
[5:16:17] Sindragozer: it was cool to see peoples gear, but everyone using the same bis list and looks the same
[5:16:33] Sindragozer: im not advocating for it, but i wouldnt care if they added it tbh
[5:16:43] Prycey: I wouldn't mind reforging coming back at some point
[5:16:48] breninn3: There's BiS though, so everyone will end up looking the same
[5:16:59] Sindragozer: respecs cap at 1g now i think
[5:17:01] dright424: I don't think most people would care if they put transmog in classic, but the people who would care would REALLY care
[5:17:04] ahux_: and the classic gear looks like dogshit

[5:24:49] slyva1510: vertGday
[5:25:14] chelfx: DK set is goat
[5:25:29] Prycey: Priest & warlock always get the best looking sets

[5:25:51] chelfx: thats this tier
[5:26:03] Prycey: thats current DH

[5:27:34] Sindragozer: im still wearing all my 25 gear too
[5:27:46] Sindragozer: i only changed offhand so far
[5:28:26] chelfx: it's a mystery

[5:49:31] BeUnseen: As someone who went through to get my 6 year degree in the US the only way to get out of it debt free is to have poor as shit parents. Cuz then the govt will give you mad grants and you can easily get a full ride but if even one parent makes above 35k youre gonna be in a PIT
