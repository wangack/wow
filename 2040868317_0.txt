[1:45:30] jerkmcgee: HUHH
[1:45:38] braindeadjoseki: praise the lard
[1:47:44] Kvistlol: @yctnm I see your point but at the same time you are forced into a stationary playstyle which is a challenge in high end content no matter what, which means that good players will excel at this while average players will struggle in high end content
[1:48:32] SiIentShade: quick SNIFFA

[2:02:52] Falothuss: Hi yumy :P! Just a question: what can be the advantage of using holy priest in m+ instead of disc?
[2:03:09] Byrchi: wOW
[2:03:14] Byrchi: Tosxix
[2:03:17] zachl_: @Falothuss easier to learn- reactive instead of proactive healing- imo more fun
[2:03:27] ewbrad: @Falothuss you get to use your brain
[2:03:53] Falothuss: :D i saw like in one group doing big keys a holy instead of a disc
[2:03:58] Falothuss: kira's team did it
[2:04:01] Falothuss: in fall
[2:04:23] Falothuss: aj is playing it
[2:04:26] Falothuss: was*
[2:05:02] Falothuss: but thanks :) was a bit confused by the fact that a holy appeared :D
[2:05:12] Silencbank: maybe getting used to it in case the buffs help it alot?
[2:05:38] zachl_: idk im p sure he was playing for fun
[2:05:40] epilepticunicorn_: alright Bedge time. GL growl. im sure in a couple more weeks you guys will get the first drop down 90% of the time
[2:05:55] Falothuss: how is prog doing btw?
[2:05:57] Byrchi: alright Bedge time. GL growl. im sure in a couple more weeks you guys will get the first drop down 90% of the time
[2:05:58] minkip831: honestly in fall i feel like im playing holy priest for the second boss trash anyway
[2:07:15] Falothuss: @minkip831 why tho? is there something specific?
[2:08:03] minkip831: i struggle a lot with managing chronoburst and corrupting sands
[2:08:10] zachl_: @minkip831 the sands dot sometimes can be hard to heal if u dont have full mindbender
[2:08:16] minkip831: so i end up flash healing and dpenancing a lot
[2:08:24] Falothuss: got it
[2:09:04] Its_Stuart: BASED Damson
[2:09:06] miyo2322: I always hated how non-top "progress" raiding was pretty much about bashing your head against a wall until the worst player in your raid doesn't mess up a mechanic for one pull
[2:09:35] Falothuss: i mean if you can achive the right community it is worth tho
[2:10:40] miyo2322: since m+ it's not been worth it imo
[2:10:55] sukoWoW: sheeeesh
[2:11:35] miyo2322: there's no prestige in being the 200th guild to kill fyrakk either
[2:13:55] harmless52: more than at 201 lol
[2:14:06] Byrchi: Do you raid for prestige?
[2:14:24] Its_Stuart: Do you M+ for presige LMAO

[6:38:04] VlNEYY: Damn. Is the Shadow pries streaming aswell?
[6:38:13] zachl_: my team calculated dread essence on 28 tyran and it was off by like at least 15% of our hp

[6:40:31] WolfSuzume: @yumytv he was in the light
[6:40:44] tvilk: @zachl_ hm yeah idk, maybe theres something wrong with it? couldnt tell
[6:41:04] sailormo0d: that fight gives me anxiety as a healer
[6:41:16] WolfSuzume: @zachl_ some spells have variance for no reason Shruge
[6:41:30] zachl_: 15% hp variance?
[6:41:41] tvilk: @WolfSuzume yeah but the website says it assumes you're taking highest variance always
[6:41:42] zachl_: idkkkkkkkkk maybe but i generally wouldnt look at that
[6:41:48] talerx: -10+10 sounds could be variance
[6:41:57] WolfSuzume: yea the bolt of the last boss in dht hits like 900k- 1.05m KEKW
[6:42:19] Tolivold: as a shaman main it makes me sad that disc and monk can do 100k+ dps while doing ~300k hps
[6:42:22] tvilk: https://imgur.com/a/wT4JlpP
[6:42:29] tvilk: shouldnt be that big of a variance
[6:42:31] zachl_: tbh if ur looking at how much something hits for, go to someone in ur class on a logged key and see what they used yumytvShrug
[6:42:38] zachl_: ive always found that more accurate
[6:42:56] tvilk: @zachl_ no just blame healer if you die
[6:43:10] talerx: btw if you played with aug it could be vers buff
[6:43:13] talerx: that made diff
[6:43:22] talerx: one after fire breath i believe?
[6:43:37] zachl_: @talerx nah it said he got brought to 5k from dread essence and he had at least  30% hp
[6:43:44] talerx: HUH
[6:44:01] talerx: tbh souldrend one is kinda misleading also
[6:44:12] talerx: our dh supposedly could survive with vers flask and blade dance
[6:44:20] tvilk: my only assumption is that zach did it wrong and refuses to take responsibility CLASSIC
[6:44:21] talerx: but in actual key he had like 15k overkill
[6:44:36] zachl_: @tvilk it was my evoker that did it yumytvShrug
[6:44:44] tvilk: and you trust an evoker?

[7:24:41] tvilk: @neeesoldr do you want something to show the keys YOU ran, or others ran?
[7:25:08] neeesoldr: others.. so that iam not inviting some slackers :D
[7:26:05] tvilk: think i need to see what that streamer you're mentioning was using in order to know what you're looking for
[7:26:28] Ryok: hello merodyHey how did raid go? made any good progress?
[7:26:32] tvilk: cus raiderio can show you number of 20+ timed dungeons and which key level the player timed on the highest level

[7:43:45] ReSeT_VT: above*
[7:43:50] Vyerre: i think its just a lower key mindset
[7:44:19] Shifter2k: I think pugging vs an actual decent group changes it massively too also
[7:44:25] Hymmer: poor growl Cryge
[7:44:50] ReSeT_VT: you just need so much stuff to build a good comp, and it's especially hard if you play something like vdh/havoc/healer
[7:45:02] tvilk: i like the idea of Warriors inspriring their allies.. and I also like the idea of a tank having lust. But I dont think it will change so warriors will magically get invited to keys

[7:45:50] Harthad: arms buff inc enough ?
[7:46:12] Shifter2k: Warrior dmg isn't the issue, it's the fact they bring nothing but the dmg

[7:48:51] tvilk: what do the vocals even say in this song

[9:59:56] TwicksTV: wtf no hyper spheres
[9:59:56] tvilk: the only reason I dont want to try this game is because you're hurting cute animals in order to recruit them
[10:00:00] simon11111987: feels more clunky than it used to for some reason, maybe it‚Äôs the dungeons but the empowered spells take so long. plus the range and frontal issues can be unplayable in pugs with hunters or boomkins who love standing the other side of the room
