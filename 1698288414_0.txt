[2:16:45] KingSlayerYotam: The all clearing mechanic is just dumb, blizz HAD to know this will hurt pugs
[2:16:45] nikola: never had probelms with thundering in EU pugs
[2:16:46] NVbrutal: cause unless your waiting till the very last second most of the time your only getting like 7 seconds of buff
[2:16:47] flebbooo: yeah Thundering has to be the worst sesonal affix so far, nothing fun about it
[2:17:03] Djfarmville: Wouldnt insta clearing the affix be considered as not doing the affix?
[2:17:08] Aquadriel: thundering makes infesting look good
[2:17:20] Orczeus: people will exploit everything
[2:17:21] RiskySaber: @KingSlayerYotam You think they who made it actually playing it ? LUL
[2:17:33] NerdyTeK: somehow all this is the demonhunters fault
[2:17:35] Djfarmville: Yeah you get the dmg buff but for only 2 sec as opposed to 10
[2:17:36] t_train_va: It would be fine if tank didn't get it
[2:17:44] wEiRdO_dUdE: It sounds good to me, to reward players for clearing it quick
[2:17:48] mavericks312: ion was like yall want a new affix here take this shit then
[2:18:02] NVbrutal: just wait till season 2 when we get the fire storm affix or some shit and its the same as thundering but with fire lol
[2:18:03] Nokterian: Now i miss S4 affix from SL
[2:18:05] zysmos: it's not fun with the rest of the affixes and other dungeon mechanics
[2:18:06] motivaattori: man that new affix sounds not cool
[2:18:16] derry10: wasn't thundering not originally going to give you a damage buff? and the only reason they added the buff was because the previous seasons affixes gave you a certain buff and people wanted that
[2:18:16] PidiaP: I like to periodically yell at Towelliee to put a ring on it and now I don’t know what to do with myself monkaS
[2:18:41] paulson14: as a caster quaking and thunder can fuck off
[2:18:41] RiskySaber: @Towelliee The BFA with portal skipping was fun 4th affix
[2:18:47] zysmos: oh no spiteful
[2:19:01] KingSlayerYotam: @RiskySaber I have to assume they do, but they arent playing pugs, my guess the test team play with itself...
[2:19:01] CrusaderNero: the thing with affixes is that they are 0% fun. Just fucking dogshit pain in the cock
[2:19:04] Demanisraar: What's with this shit weeks at the start of the season KEKW
[2:19:08] falldrgn: I think ill pull an echo.. and take a break from next weeks afixes
[2:19:32] zysmos: Blizzard definitely need to revisit all these affixes
[2:19:47] KingSlayerYotam: I just dont understand blizz have to put kiss/curse in the seasonal,. the normal affixes are already a curse. Just give us a fun affix to play with
[2:19:51] DevilMinionTerry: oblivion soundtrack ftw
[2:20:05] mavericks312: raz nerfs inc
[2:20:19] CrusaderNero: @KingSlayerYotam would be great with something fun & cool yea
[2:20:25] NVbrutal: yea think we need a complete refresh on affixes have had these same ones for 7 years now time to change it up.
[2:20:46] abracka_: imo, i don't think they would beat echo or liquid same day start
[2:20:55] BoezIRL: wiping at terros lfr, this is going to be fun
[2:21:03] mavericks312: well yea cause china just runs into the wall till the wall falls
[2:21:36] thasthebear: @BoezIRL Took me 2 stacks of determination for lfr terros LUL NotLikeThis
[2:21:43] mavericks312: theres no strat talking with china guilds just pull pull pull
[2:21:55] CrusaderNero: *opens door*  "YOU KILLED RAZ YET?"  "No"  *Slams door shut*
[2:22:05] Mecabeast: if raz gets a knock back nerf like jailer did kekw
[2:22:26] lithium364: why not just make an kiss one, other games do it too
[2:22:36] Demanisraar: My team just clears it asap, fuck this affix
[2:22:55] lithium364: spawn an random Ion NPC who needs /kiss for an group wide buff
[2:23:07] lithium364: Kappa
[2:23:37] Dox023: In Max’s QA he said that the Chinese guilds wouldn’t be close in a same day start.
[2:23:43] im_capy: towOof
[2:23:44] Dox023: iirc
[2:23:44] fluffk1n: cant wait for that bellular vid of "omg m+ numbers in and its half of SL wow is in a terrible state"
[2:23:45] Crowzcut: yes china gone at last
[2:23:56] Zucchey: Doesn't china still get 2 resets a week?
[2:23:58] aumixp: @towelliee gz to getting married ❤️ Finaly you did it
[2:24:04] mavericks312: imagine china won worlds first an then you kill there servers
[2:24:20] flebbooo: Would chinese people play on NA realms most likely over EU for better ping?
[2:24:32] abracka_: i mean, china only started a day after echo. echo had the kill how many days before them? 4 right?
[2:24:36] CardinalTX: Im out of touch......Chinese govt kill the servers or what?
[2:24:57] Squirrel_nutty: no, a deal couldent be made
[2:24:58] CrusaderNero: Congrats on engagement :) Going to be a big wedding or ?
[2:25:06] CardinalTX: ah
[2:25:11] NerdyTeK: call elon tell him to buy china
[2:25:22] flebbooo: tencent monkaS
[2:25:24] forsenbaij: dont understand why people care so much about worlds first. Cool, great, worlds first, but why such bubble and even hotfixes that affect EVERYONE just for some tryhard diehard players
[2:25:35] yogibearz: what embelishement do you use?
[2:25:43] NerdyTeK: @asmontopfan its fun content to watch
[2:25:45] NVbrutal: waiting for that microsoft deal to go through and put wow on gamepass for the chinese players lol.
[2:26:08] Crowzcut: never when microsoft takesover never happen
[2:26:10] NerdyTeK: @NVbrutal  wow on gp is gunna be HUGE
[2:26:19] mavericks312: @asmontopfan becasue if the worlds best cant kill the raid withought hotfixes your 3rd world guild damn sure aint killing it
[2:26:23] Vexcreus: i hate that warrior tanks are essentially seen in pugs as the only viable tank
[2:26:25] forsenbaij: watching 20 guys in a room wipe for 3 days straight? Such fun content man LUL

[2:27:12] mavericks312: @Vexcreus could be worse you could be a brew or dh tank
[2:27:55] forsenbaij: @mavericks312 thats why overall statistics exists, you dont need to base hotfixes based on top guilds that then affect everyone

[3:18:48] imvitalx: My father owns a jewelry store and they make custom rings. Tedious is not a word lol
[3:18:49] Alienfromger: it would take 5 minutes for men LUL
[3:18:49] Fawcheddar: let me swipe
[3:18:50] SundanceC: take my money
[3:18:50] kashmara: They do that at my work as well. Some people plan their whole kitchen over 4 hours.
[3:18:51] Shiz_zap: llmao
[3:18:56] Nokterian: @Demanisraar Same paid for it not much thank god 17 euro's.
[3:19:03] Sollice: Wel its something she will wear the rest of her life
[3:19:07] capricore: We were able to customize my wife's engagement ring and they showed me like 8 different diamonds, and like 20 settings
[3:19:10] Sollice: So it does make sense it takes that long
[3:19:14] woody879: I did it for 9 years
[3:19:15] Dagomarus: Ands its like…. Can i just put in a work order for a bis ring?

[3:19:53] Demanisraar: @Nokterian oh? weird mine was only like 5 euro
[3:19:54] thetorque162: Sorry towellie my internet started spiking mid feast i don't wanna accidentally brick your key.
[3:19:56] roflpotamus: where do I spend valor?
[3:20:02] thebakeriscomingforu: depending on the ring.. it is an asset. So it is treated as that. Paperwork, warranties, guarantees, insurance, etc.
[3:20:06] LoseAlotLuke: Arcane boss is scary
[3:20:22] jasonbriggs: ret kekw
[3:20:25] Nokterian: @Demanisraar bigger package always cost more.
[3:20:38] DarthWrex: @towelliee what WA is that for your LFG view?
[3:20:38] Dagomarus: Fury im theory should be great for the tree boss with the easy cleave
[3:20:46] Demanisraar: @Nokterian I only bought a hoodie so might be it yeah
[3:20:48] WhiteKnight74648: Whats a ret?
[3:20:56] LoseAlotLuke: tbh storming does no damage, its just the small knockup which is annoying
[3:20:59] IronWishfull: ret pumps
[3:21:00] tebbix: ret FeelsBadMan
[3:21:01] wEiRdO_dUdE: Nobody calling rets these days
[3:21:06] Voltaictv: Ive been considering making a ret, they are very rare rn
[3:21:06] Demanisraar: I play ret, it's pretty good in m+ atm
[3:21:07] LoseAlotLuke: ret does more AOE than most classes
[3:21:08] pereadin: I push keys sometimes with an off meta group where we use a ret paladin
[3:21:14] remixonfire91: had a ret yesterday on a 18 he pumped hard
[3:21:22] PidiaP: Is Algathar wheelchair accessible? Kappa
[3:21:26] Sykum: does Ret even exist anymore? Kappa
[3:21:32] Nokterian: @Demanisraar no i won in the christmas raffle from towelliee claus
[3:21:33] flebbooo: great game KEKW
[3:21:38] w00zzi: Ret slaps single too
[3:21:41] WhiteKnight74648: crash into a tree, crash the game
[3:21:42] realnzall: @Towelliee Congratulations on the enagement
[3:21:54] jasonbriggs: dont ret just have one spell judgement lol
[3:22:01] Demanisraar: Form the last 4 seasons
[3:22:06] Kelticlore: you went so fast youbspeed to a dc lol
[3:22:08] w00zzi: I have no idea right now, they are good
[3:22:10] Jattell: asmongold dishing on mcconnel
[3:22:11] JustinSutherby: they die easy
[3:22:16] akia03: vanila?
[3:22:19] scalext: aggro issues
[3:22:21] IronWishfull: ret lacks defensives after bubble
[3:22:22] PvtHudson093: that we have no raid utility and very niche utility
[3:22:24] hobbsii: they people that play them
[3:22:25] w00zzi: How do they die easy?
[3:22:28] Jattell: slow as hell
[3:22:31] w00zzi: vs a hunter or mage?
[3:22:33] realnzall: @Towelliee Survival and utility suck. Everything they bring can be brought by a Prot or Holy as well
[3:22:34] WhiteKnight74648: no mobilty
[3:22:35] Demanisraar: Shield of vengeance
[3:22:39] grimji92: Ret is the melee huntard
[3:22:39] Dagomarus: They chained together some rough seasons and now theres a stigma
[3:22:44] Demanisraar: We are slow
[3:22:46] Demanisraar: that is all
[3:22:47] w00zzi: not that slow either
[3:22:47] adam6683: Off heals are always great
[3:22:55] w00zzi: we have double horse
[3:22:59] Ryenonn: What does a Ret bring to the table over other Melee?
[3:23:01] LoseAlotLuke: why bring ret when you can just take a holy paladin
[3:23:14] jetributions: bop is not in the builds
[3:23:20] w00zzi: Utility
[3:23:24] g0n_z3n: off-heals?
[3:23:28] Demanisraar: Why take a hopo when you can take a druid?
[3:23:28] Milkshank: they bring brez now
[3:23:31] im_capy: Ret, SV and Feral seem like they are all roommates
[3:23:32] Litebrite10: brez
[3:23:39] PvtHudson093: lol wasting a point on Devo aura when ret is tuned around ret aura
[3:23:41] Murry07: We can't use only one in 30 sec anyway because of Forbeeance
[3:23:44] w00zzi: Brez is sick npw
[3:23:50] Quikbeard: It’s decent but it’s not a DH, Rogue, Enhance or WW.
[3:23:50] AlphasaurusRexx: aoe bline, interrupt, DR, sac, LoH, BoP, brez. the fuck do warriors bring...damage buff?
[3:23:54] Murry07: can*

[3:26:19] capricore: They ran Splash Mountain when it was 50 degrees in Florida lul

[3:37:03] RySiggy: @Emrys345 MW is in the gutter
[3:37:08] Triggered: @Emrys345 Yep, if you play monk and it's not WW, you're into some self torture type beat.

[3:38:41] ZachTriesTooHard: Im 399 ilvl (rogue), cant even get into anything higher than a 15 to give them a shot. Pugs are getting kind of ridiculous now
[3:39:00] Emrys345: @Emrys345 Yeah, ive been following all her videos and trying.
[3:39:20] Zimmygee: gear naturally makes it easier over time anyways
[3:39:26] AlphasaurusRexx: first season is usually the hardest imo
[3:39:37] MessyZerg: they will kill participation in only content that kept wow alive
[3:40:15] Molvonos: Prideful wasn't bad at all
[3:40:23] They_Call_Me_Monty: @towelliee will they uncap valor before the season ends?
[3:40:31] AlphasaurusRexx: prideful was hard to heal sometimes
[3:40:33] PvtHudson093: Prideful just meant waiting for it then going for the boss
[3:41:14] GameWithDerp: 383 hunter, got declined for every 8-10 I applied for yesterday, was fun, went to go level my rogue whose ilvl 140 and cannot spend primeval essense on catch up gear cause storm hunter went on vacay ... goooooood times.

[4:04:44] Jango_: @Towelliee  grats on the engagement buddy!
[4:04:55] iamhijack: can we vote no on all affixes?
[4:05:04] doxylive: But maybe that’s why it’s good. It’s a challenge to push higher keys
[4:05:08] Molvonos: @iamhijack That's what M0 is for.
[4:05:08] pigzip: If you choose, no then what happens to you
[4:05:15] doxylive: Still sucks. But who knows
[4:05:17] WeedFranck: really fun to run 8 m+ for the vault and looting nothing KEKW
[4:05:47] fluffk1n: cant wait for 10.0.5 patch notes to be like "tanks and healer roles can now never get stunned from thundering afix"
[4:05:50] WeedFranck: would you run this +15 without afflixes? YES.
[4:05:53] pavepawns: can we vote for instead of kiss curse all affixes are kiss :)
[4:06:14] iamhijack: the problem is non of the affixes are fun
[4:06:25] aleck1776: How about you just make the dps get stunned ;)
[4:07:05] TheOGDaywalker: congrats
[4:07:09] PvtHudson093: there's a debuff?
[4:07:14] doxylive: I think they should implement something like it you choose to get rid of thundering, key fails after x amount of deaths.
[4:07:21] Synaerio: adapt and overcome :P
[4:07:21] AlphasaurusRexx: they also stand still during the aoe and stand in their own swirlies
[4:07:21] EvoThis: congrats you two!
[4:07:29] sephronz: @towelliee What would be the 4 Mythic Affixs that would cause you to say "Hey all, we not doing any High level keys this week?"

[4:57:34] WeedFranck: anyway, when you sim, it's a bot playing, but player is really hard to reach the sim dps because we are human... ?
[4:58:09] WeedFranck: mmm ok noted
[4:58:27] duhworks: and a lot of sim are patchwork so no movement
[4:58:43] sgreth: Running another marathon soon to pay for the big rock? towLove Congrats again HSCheers
[4:58:51] ZachTriesTooHard: @WeedFranck It's basically having all objects fixed, and the variable object is the gear you change. So you can see what does better overall.
[4:58:55] WeedFranck: mmmm perfect world was a good game Kappa
[4:59:08] BraveChicken81: what's the best raiding tank these days? just coming back after 10 years
[4:59:20] DailieBlue: whats best dps class to play as a new player?
[4:59:38] Krait06: yeah shits off this time
[4:59:46] camarac: M+ dungeons are very unrewarding this season
[4:59:52] hwiyo: same for me
[4:59:55] WeedFranck: @WeedFranck anyway I don't need to sim, last week I did 8 m+ for the vault and looted nothing, only got 1 pieces change from the vault KEKW
[4:59:56] Keglett: i love getting shit on gachiHYPER
[5:00:00] iDeez88: ive done 70+ mythics, not a SINGLE 2handed weapon has dropped yet
[5:00:01] ryot_tyme: having issues on my tanks too
[5:00:02] JasperCalico: 🤨
[5:00:08] 777zs: thank god for crafting and vault or id be trash lol
[5:00:10] chase_xoxo: You’re not wrong, it feels way off as a healer too
[5:00:25] PvtHudson093: Ive not had any drop yet
[5:00:26] iDeez88: atleast its not just me
[5:00:27] largefromage: my guild hasn't seen a single druid tier token drop
[5:00:35] ZachTriesTooHard: I feel like they forced that so people can do other content, which is kind of ironic given they want you to do WHATEVER you want.
[5:00:39] Cheapesttactics1: the vault can be good.
[5:00:40] Keglett: I think I've seen 1 trinket drop in 3+ weeks of M+
[5:00:41] zorrowin: 2/5 loot rules?
[5:00:41] Krait06: the whole damn thing is in shambles
[5:00:47] WeedFranck: only got one piece changed last week was from the vault.

[5:00:50] Molvonos: Yea, there's definitely something going on with loot.  I see there's two pieces of loot going out from the chest, but the luck's not there.
[5:00:53] chazavier: they want you to craft
[5:00:54] austinnn2421: I need ranged weapon I’ve done a ton of mythics and haven’t had any drops and same with trinkets
[5:00:56] michaelmm: I feel they have reduced M+ loot to match raid drops - when they should have done the opposite!
[5:01:00] Rudric_Ice: blizz wants you to play raids more than m+
[5:01:18] JasperCalico: make the raids better lol
[5:01:20] iDeez88: raiding is hard nowadays because everyones free time is so different
[5:01:22] michaelmm: If they want more people to raid they need to make raiding feel more rewarding.
[5:01:34] Compl1cated576: usually 2 gear pieces drops which is way too low
[5:01:36] ZachTriesTooHard: vault of the incarnates is also pretty easy on normal, so you can do raid. Agree with your sentiment on pushing the raid.
[5:01:37] ryot_tyme: im terrified to tank raids so im fucked lol
[5:01:37] WeedFranck: @Towelliee I got my grieftorch heroic from the 4 mythic rewards KEKW
[5:01:41] demiilova93: like impossible to get loot tho
[5:01:43] demiilova93: lmao
[5:01:48] demiilova93: Raid its too hard to gear through
[5:01:51] iDeez88: also, every guild is 800+ people and 12 active concurrently
[5:01:56] kosmos_qc: yea let wipe for 3 hours for 200 gold reward OMEGALUL
[5:02:00] duhworks: valor needs to be un-cap or the cap per week needs to increase and 1 more drop per run
[5:02:08] DevilSpire: @towelliee I’ve never really been huge into M+
[5:02:14] ZachTriesTooHard: like if you compare the difficulty of sepulcher vs. vault its night and fucking day
[5:02:18] Compl1cated576: I did 10+ runs in the same doungeon for a trinket and I consider myself lucky that I got it under 15 runs
[5:02:33] lithium364: the wounds of korthia still run deep in the community
[5:02:40] eggs_tyrone: They should fix the pug raid group finder to be similar to M+
[5:02:41] largefromage: LUL
[5:02:41] mischy_: Its so weird. On my brew monk I've run so many more dungeons than my mage. Yet they are almost the same ilvl because my mage keeps getting drops and my monk gets none lol
[5:02:42] odtee: if 3/5 players got loot every m+ that would be a big improvement

[5:07:23] AlphasaurusRexx: i feel like its better to shroud skip this hallway and then come back after dungeon to pull a bunch
[5:07:24] WeedFranck: 392.xx
[5:07:28] JasperCalico: evoker has a soothe
[5:07:37] Molvonos: Not a good one
[5:07:42] HawkCorrigan: thanks
[5:08:04] JasperCalico: aoe soothe not good? exemSadge
[5:08:15] WeedFranck: EZ boss she look like a trainning dummy for me
[5:08:17] JasperCalico: CD is too long honestly
[5:08:46] WeedFranck: Pog Evoker dps
[5:09:23] Molvonos: @PrincessAww Not a good AoE.  Cone, which means you're liable to miss a few mobs.  That plus a 2-min cooldown (especially if you whiff it), or bare minimum, 1 minute, 40 second cooldown makes it hard. Plus, not every mob enrages at the same time, so the 'AoE' aspect isn't as clean.
[5:09:39] Rudric_Ice: if u think Ruby is shit just wait for Halls of infusion lmao

[6:26:35] wEiRdO_dUdE: There are some other really good groups, but yeah it won't be easy
[6:26:42] ZeusDNA: Maybe Echo will make a 2nd MDI team but with mustaches as a disguise to beat themselves
[6:26:55] crunchyFrog999: Not Echo
[6:26:58] WeedFranck: KEKW
[6:27:00] pereadin: like old method NA vs method EU KEKW
[6:27:09] Mockle: only way echo looses is when echo renames itself and beats themselves
[6:27:21] Jarlan23: imagine if they had a draft for the mdi
[6:27:24] Jarlan23: that could be fun
[6:27:39] WeedFranck: MDI Shuffles KEKW
[6:27:48] g0n_z3n: i doubt it lol
[6:27:52] HoppsiDejsi: Techniqually they wil have new team coz £MEthodFrag LUL
[6:27:53] devoted_bee: Suffering from success
[6:28:09] g0n_z3n: oh yeah, boring to watch for sure
[6:28:15] WeedFranck: too much succes... I quit KEKW
[6:28:20] PotbellyGoat: we'll have so much winning, you'll get bored of winning
[6:28:46] spookychefkarolina: Implement some sort of winning cap before you have to re-start, but that’ll never happen.
[6:28:53] crunchyFrog999: echo has to play with winter gloves on ..
[6:29:05] Incredible_Sausage: is it Echo's fault for winning or the other teams faults for not doing as well?
[6:29:07] Dreyahri: they may have been loosing for several races, but they are still one of the best contenders imo
[6:29:09] Plague_GG: I meam how many times did blood legion lose to paragon and method and kept going
[6:29:12] WhiteKnight74648: EZ
[6:29:15] WeedFranck: echo win only with 1 hand Kappa
[6:29:17] Whoracle1337: #AllRigged
[6:29:25] OMGitsDIRTY223: Just resign
[6:29:33] eakiller: race fixing
[6:29:39] MackPlays: If the contests were more official and prizes they’d be more competitive
[6:29:45] Dreyahri: if new e sports teams would participate and they look very good the others could dip out for a tier or 2
[6:29:55] Funderik: echo's viewership wasn't down
[6:29:59] tiyanigean: granted, VoI didnt have a Halondurs
[6:30:00] spookychefkarolina: Force them into retirement from the races LUL
[6:30:04] Brodih_: if all the teams had the same ressources, then it would be fun
[6:30:09] Deusey: It went down because of splits, they are boring
[6:30:10] Heero_Effect: I also think viewership drops because less people playing DF.
[6:30:12] allisonkielle: People lost the faith with shadowlands
[6:30:14] Daveybutter: how bout cameras on the dance floor?
[6:30:27] xmedpakx: no offense but world first kinda does not matter to most people
[6:30:27] Jarlan23: i wanna know if any person that doesnt know what WoW is looks at the WFR and says "Oh shit, I wanna play this"
[6:30:38] shapebender: there is always the big thing about release time and head starts ... they almost need to world release and sync maint during the race to elminate that.
[6:30:48] Funderik: the liquid franchise will bail on them eventually
[6:30:57] Dreyahri: i believe that people are waiting for a patch or 2, more content before your start the repetitive gear grind in mythics
[6:31:00] Whoracle1337: it becomes an echo chamber Kappa
[6:31:19] falldrgn: @Jarlan23 because its  not for them. thats more geared towards people who are currently playing and or raiding.
[6:31:25] AlphasaurusRexx: @Whoracle1337 get out
[6:31:28] ottavianni: dosen't the  race being close to holidays affect the views ?
[6:31:30] abracka_: yes
[6:31:31] spookychefkarolina: @whoracle1337 LUL
[6:31:31] Funderik: 3 mthod 1 pieces 1 limit
[6:31:32] MackPlays: All esports teams profits are down tbf
[6:31:37] Notabrick: yea 3 method
[6:31:52] shapebender: limit has the argument to displace the head start that they got to the bug and had to wait on the fix and echo got it released with the fix
[6:31:52] Moobot:  Help Towelliee reach the 1,000,000 followers goal during the WoW:Dragonflight marathons. Click that heart button and join the Hammer Squad community!
[6:31:53] Funderik: no, limit one 1 in SL echo won 2,
[6:32:01] Todmeister9000: RWF started in Uldir? I just realized I've watched all of them
[6:32:03] Jarlan23: As as it's close I'd say that's enough. But it it's not, like liquid kills it a few days later each time, people would get very bored
[6:32:23] Lulaboo: Esports orgs in general have always lost money and have never been able to make money without outside help. If Liquid guild continues to loose the org money then I see them getting dropped
[6:33:11] Funderik: oh boy, that's some take..
[6:33:18] Incredible_Sausage: head to head is always better
[6:33:26] falldrgn: Both liquid and Echo had their moments.. in races..
[6:33:27] ScopedPixels: Gratz on the engagement :)
[6:33:32] GingerGambit: The .05 wipe…
[6:33:42] MackPlays: That’s like saying all footballs games should be close scores
[6:33:46] Brodih_: did Ted say if he was still going to compete in RWF, he hinted that he was getting burned?
[6:33:52] naphelas: liquid is weak with non-ptr bosses. echo is better with it imo
[6:34:02] shapebender: like the MDI race's and great push stuff ... each team running at the same time
[6:34:25] mavericks312: we need liquid loot
[6:34:28] mavericks312: sloot*
[6:34:33] Mockle: @shakga how is being the current second best guild weak
[6:34:43] Cello_73: congrats on the engagement @Towelliee ! <3
[6:34:52] StreamElements: Use code POGTOWEL120 for $120 off at https://strms.net/TowellieeFactorMarBot #ad
[6:35:02] falldrgn: Imean Gingi's schedule is insane.. RWF>MDI> TGP and sale runs ontop of that..
[6:35:04] Brodih_: echo beat the last boss with 100 less attemps than limit, thats pretty crazy
[6:35:34] Ketchup_Popsicle: thats how i feel in fantasy lol
[6:35:36] demiilova93: @Qazh_ cause they waited til nerfs went through
[6:35:36] NordoTv: Playing fore self pride maybe
[6:35:51] naphelas: @Mockle i am talking about world first race. liquid struggling with bosses that isnt tested in ptr. same happened in sepulcher too. liquid was pretty fast until last 3 bosses which blizzard didnt test them in ptr. thats the fact
[6:35:59] Brodih_: @demiilova93 ahhh good point!
[6:36:04] metavahn231: influence?
[6:36:13] AlphasaurusRexx: @Qazh_ thats always been their respective strategies though. Echo talks about each of their pulls and analyzes. Liquid learns through repetitions.
[6:36:13] Moobot:  Check out Towelliee's YouTube channel! You can view the most recent uploaded video HERE || INSANELY FAST leveling in Dragonflight!! - 1 Level in 10 minutes! youtu.be/6xfv45XhvJI
[6:36:22] Jarlan23: it's like the yankees and red sox competing and everyone else is in the minor leagues
[6:36:24] MedicineMan: Pay to win lol
[6:36:24] Sneakiel0l: @Qazh_ thats the way it always is. Echo takes a more methodical approach with their pulls and talks more between pulls to discuss went wrong. Liquid does more rapid fire approach.
[6:36:27] Dreyahri: the more feedback you obtain through your viewership
[6:36:39] strongbox: it's like how F1 racing is stacked with just a couple or three great teams at the top
[6:36:43] metavahn231: MDI is just more competitive i feel
[6:36:43] Moobot: Towelliee is rocking the new Logitech Sona Mic! Check it out at https://imp.i125364.net/Yg5neP Click on Blue and check out the Sona Mic !!
[6:36:50] beauds69: The race needs more skill not massive resources needed to compete, also have even playing field like League of legends and other sports. It's really troll that liquid and all these teams do massive split runs. But idk how you do that with an mmo.
[6:36:57] ThePawPaw: @MedicineMan pay to progress faster ;)
[6:37:00] LegendaryViewer: but if that's the type of even viewers enjoy watching what to do?
[6:37:05] metavahn231: RFW just feels like a community event where anything goes lol
[6:37:20] duhworks: there no gearing in the MDI
[6:37:20] Dreyahri: many eyes will notice more valuable things happening on your screen, they could very well figure out your mechanic while your wiping at it
[6:37:32] tiyanigean: @elixirfield1 thats precisely what it is!
[6:37:32] Funderik: that;s what is has always been
[6:37:44] MedicineMan: @MedicineMan Orgs have more resources (money) to buy gold and dumb it on people for gear.
[6:37:50] MackPlays: You should race Towelliee
[6:37:52] beauds69: @duhworks Yeah its even playing field which an esport should be
[6:38:15] duhworks: gear grind* in the MDI
[6:38:22] grimji92: RWF on a tourney realm would be about the players
[6:38:22] beauds69: They need to make a timed race or m+ race
[6:38:25] Dreyahri: KEKW
[6:38:29] westelan_: LUL
[6:38:29] beauds69: for raid
[6:38:29] Snabido: Same thing 😏
[6:38:34] MackPlays: Sluut
[6:38:35] Todmeister9000: KEKW
[6:38:36] topher057: sloot/slut, tomato/tomahto
[6:38:40] Artful_Dodger: :D
