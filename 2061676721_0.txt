[1:54:57] Satyr13: @Prodigy________________ You do not have pushback protection so in PvP in stv when everything is very fast, you will never cast starfire
[1:55:09] Satyr13: @NeddTheNerd Yeah i just noticed that. That i have no pushback protection for some unknown reason
[1:55:12] Satyr13: even tho it says it has 70%
[1:55:31] Thezorlul: i wonder for pvp. would you trade sform for 7 points in disc for pushback immunity. specially in duels
[1:55:31] NeddTheNerd: yeah its just bugged
[1:56:04] Soonerrr: lmao 805 noncrit LUL
[1:56:17] Thezorlul: SW:D hits way too hard

[1:57:29] Thezorlul: tbc spriest vs bm feeling
[1:57:41] prodigy_wow: @Satyr13 Eclipse helps, 1 second lower cast time on starfire
[1:57:53] my_keii: most hunters are bm right now, both melee and ranged
[1:58:17] Soonerrr: nice boomie nerf haha
[1:58:22] NeddTheNerd: starsurge gives it too
[1:58:22] Hayzed0ut: yeah
[1:58:28] Hayzed0ut: boomie nerf my ass
[1:58:32] Selecktt: I simply have more hp than spriest. They death me, eat their own damage, die. Zug zug.
[1:58:33] Ifumi: @Soonerrr it is nerfed way too hard
[1:58:33] prodigy_wow: starsurge gives both buffs
[1:58:35] Hayzed0ut: nerf hunters though
[1:58:36] NeddTheNerd: starsurge gives 2 stacks of starsurge crit and 1 starfire cast speed
[1:58:54] prodigy_wow: Counts as both
[1:58:55] NeddTheNerd: ya exactly
[1:58:57] Kaekias: Git gud is why it is always critting hydraMindgoose
[1:59:01] cayry: It counts as both
[1:59:03] LesGoTV: I swear this boomie "nerf" is def not a nerf, it just requires more setup, but its essentially a LEGIT one shot if set up correctly, seeing as starfire is 100% sp coeff
[1:59:09] googlewooglex: it seems like druids always have all buffs at all times
[1:59:17] prodigy_wow: everything always crits
[1:59:24] Ifumi: @LesGoTV have you even read the patchnotes?
[1:59:28] Kaekias: go respec right now
[1:59:51] Kaekias: is there dual spec yet? i heard they were thinking about it (at some point)
[2:00:24] LesGoTV: @Ifumi I have, have you checked WCL post nerf? Rank 1 4 and 6 on Grubbis for example is post "nerf"
[2:01:08] jezzi23: I happen to main boomkin so I experimented with the changes. Turns out that the 66% starfire buff only works on the already low base damage (lvl 34 spell). So with decent spell power the starfire is effectively only 30-40% stronger, not 66% :(
[2:01:26] Hayzed0ut: yep thats why Marksman/Survival will always be pvp king
[2:01:33] hipokondri: hello, i just saw your disc pvp bis list. can i ask why u use winter's might enchant on weapon? i heard it doesnt even glow xD

[2:02:14] LesGoTV: Starfire being 100% sp coeff comes out to 1500 ish crits with 180 sp (which i´d assume most players can get with pre bis)

[2:02:33] Kaekias: KEKW
[2:03:06] Thezorlul: thats why i went alch engi. alch shit always sells
[2:03:11] LesGoTV: @jezzi23 level 34 spell rank is not too bad seeing as its 100% sp coeff, it was 43% coeff like mind blast for example, the base dmg matters more
