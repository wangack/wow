[1:11:45] whopperplopped: Dudes could have a stroke mid fight.
[1:12:00] TheGiant99: world first kill isnt worth your health
[1:12:01] Seventhedeadly: Kush looks like he's about to pass out

[1:13:23] Lordrune13: echo is not pulling atm

[1:15:21] Roadskii: @mavericks312 None of you actually know what goes on behind the scenes. Not really fair to make assumptions
[1:15:36] Mecabeast: is it best to get like the first or last number of the numbered cards?

[1:37:42] Seventhedeadly: Roger is talking with Scripe... I hope they get some rest soon... they are crazy for going this long.. I understand winning but  pushing yourself this hard is bad
[1:37:45] Lazarenth: i bet liquid goes to bed at normal time unless liquid hits a pull under 5%
[1:37:45] nevercluckyy: at this rate if echo ends up getting the kill they are going to have a heart attack if they try to celebrate

[1:40:14] pronkk_: its wild how liquid can hold lust to p3 and echo has to burn on the infernals
[1:40:35] Lazarenth: unless they are omega close they will go to bed at normal time
[1:40:47] ChocoDecay: I think Liquid can do it. A string of good pulls can lead to a kill pretty quick.
[1:41:07] Lazarenth: liquid has their strat they just gotta play p3 perfect
[1:41:12] bygodwest: Max and a few of them still think that it can be a kill on any pull

[1:42:51] Lazarenth: feel like echo are boned for a whole day if they dont kill it on this too-long day
[1:42:55] Throdio: I think Liquid would need to be pulling consistent sub 5% pulls to extend there day
[1:43:05] Lazarenth: its the npc that tells you error messages in starcraft
[1:43:08] PotbellyGoat: Spectral is so shimmery
[1:43:09] Lazarenth: like need more vespene gas
