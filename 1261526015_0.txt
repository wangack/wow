[0:33:50] oldcauliflower: The alliance deserve honor just like the Horde does, if you PvP there are no losers. Both sides win!

[0:35:05] Andy1982: hey togther! Greetings from Germany
[0:35:15] solo19op: where is your premade @swifty
[0:35:45] oldcauliflower: Horde is appreciative of alliance very much so. The way they got it set up is, yes, the winner gets more honor but both sides acquire honor so there are technically no losers.
[0:35:56] Fluffyxstuff: remember the 2 blood dk arenas?
[0:35:56] DonTheDeveloper: LUL
[0:36:25] DonTheDeveloper: lmao
[0:36:37] oldcauliflower: I mean if the losers got 0 honor I don't think that would go over too well. There would be almost no reason to even pvp at all.

[0:37:07] orntwitch: !talents
[0:37:55] oldcauliflower: I hope you don't set it to where losers now get 0 honor. Like the accumulative honor throughout the BG is taken away once they lose. That would be a terrible idea.
[0:37:58] dnaksBOY: What gear do you have?

[0:43:58] Theado123: Swifty is it too late to get into SOM? Completely missed the launch thanks bro
[0:44:02] oldcauliflower: What happened when you popped templar wings was you regained a large % of health plus a boost in attack power. And flying with those wings. The Templars could also cast stam steal so once they got airborn as long as they could stam steal they could stay aloft for longer periods of time.
[0:44:04] slugga__d: How many hours a day are you pvping swift?

[0:45:11] StreamElements: Type !points to see how many points you have!
[0:45:15] Theado123: @martyn47 thank you . Is it staying in classic era?
[0:45:19] oldcauliflower: And if the opponent you are stam stealing from was swimming then a lot of <so and so died from water> Which prompted this guy to make a character named Water.
[0:45:24] Macosqt: @Littlehoodie16 theres a rumor it can get copied into TBC OR wotlk
[0:45:25] HasbullasBro: swifty whats your schedule looking like
[0:45:29] solsaver12: wish they get transfer to tbc server

[0:45:39] Linuxer86: Do alliance have lower queues than horde for BG in SoM ?
[0:45:41] HasbullasBro: lol
[0:45:48] NickyNevs: nah..it would likely stay dead. they need to make them xferrable to tbc
[0:45:49] just_haydn: @Swifty  just wanted to thank you for saving my life in 2013.
[0:45:50] Varren__: after a few SOM seasons, maybe Classic + and you can use all your SOM toons
[0:45:58] martyn47: it'll probably be quicker levelling each time
[0:46:07] ottertribe: @Swifty do you regret picking enhancement shaman for the rank 14 grind or would you pick a different class if you could choose again
[0:46:07] Kingkryptek1: How many Hks have u gotten so far?

[0:46:51] Littlehoodie16: @Macosqt They would keep a lot more players subbed if they could transfer the SoM characters to BC classic.
[0:46:51] oldcauliflower: Honor grind in classic was beyond terrible. I remember lots of posts on the forums of WarLords who had actually done the grind would post about it complaining that the grind was just almost impossibly long and too difficult.
[0:46:55] neevir: i don't understand myself either

[0:47:35] radanrad: Hi, Swifty. Do you think TBC is dead? There's no one in PvP :(
[0:47:41] Littlehoodie16: The main reason I haven't created a toon for SoM is because the thought of when it's over the toons get transferrred to dead servers.
[0:47:45] Astrosparkle: If you are having fun it is what it is.
[0:47:45] Rmpone: scrubnoobPepega

[0:49:30] Metalicat206: @beinthemirror top secret spec
[0:49:45] oldcauliflower: Just my opinion.
