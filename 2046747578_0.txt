[0:38:55] carlos_the_7th: Retail is on its way to become League of Legends and with that they're trying to make avaible the most "skins" possible; Just look at the "Sylvannas transmog" soon to be avaible
[0:39:02] Plokoon100: eh tru
[0:39:06] SeeMoreThings: Pog free lambo
[0:39:10] Sunyankzi: It's an item from 11 years ago, it's good that they're allowing newer players to be able to obtain it too. People been able to flaunt it and be proud of it for long enough for the novelty to wear off from it. Also 7000+ Trader's Tender is an insane amount you can get 1500 a month.
[0:39:12] CannonM2K: Now you need Bugatti
[0:39:14] cyonara74: i tried to get my friend to play wow, he saw a mount he wanted and i told him he could never get that mount.  he quit.

[0:40:32] smyagole: what lol
[0:40:46] madgarlicjr: @NutterCircus true
[0:40:46] kaladhras: riding the scarab lord mount is like being an ancient emperor in a palanquin carried by 40 slaves
[0:40:51] grizz430: @bonius_ dont be butthurt
[0:40:52] DINGODOGGERDUDE: can you get kathy on stream so we can here her perspective of the events?

[0:41:05] Highkriger: There are rumors that the MoP challange mode transmog sets are going to be added to the trading post

[0:42:00] theori93: theori93 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 20 months! 
[0:42:05] Voidbonx: fomo drives subs away :<
[0:42:09] Raivan994: eh, it's not that important
[0:42:09] Cmath182: people were buying carries for heirloom weapons, average players got it back then
[0:42:10] R3ga1: they should accelerate it and add them all
[0:42:14] grizz430: I was pissed when they put the pet from the 2008 olympics in the trading post. One of the few things I have that not a lot of other people have anymore

[2:30:36] patsukevich_: The United States and Israel have signed multiple bilateral defense cooperation agreements
[2:30:40] Mauraderss: imagine having a foreign country disagree with your way of life and then invade your country to try and assimilate you.   that’s what the US tends to do

[2:48:12] izikperz: we play competitive wsg games every night 10v10 in-house
[2:48:13] KrotonGG: Inc BOE greens
[2:48:14] zanthixx: epic bracers AND pants at 60 tho
[2:48:15] AxelFromAustralia: they gonna add a crafted set easier to get
[2:48:16] Spanos_: I talked to a guy doing it on his 2nd character ><
[2:48:18] jimbonni: i will be sad if ther a greeny LOL
[2:48:21] DBGmal: They are bis and there wasn't much going on this phase after you get your runes and bis
[2:48:22] Thurman__1: I bet the wsg reputation grind will be a lot more fun next phase
[2:48:25] Dreako00: I knew Blizzard would take too long with the releases of the phases
[2:48:26] Voidbonx: KEKW
[2:48:27] lucasarino1: honestly i got exalted on 2 characters because i have a deep seated hatred of myself
[2:48:29] DBGmal: not exalted but kinda close
[2:48:32] divadnothsa: That's how bored, I have priest at wsg exalted both alts revered
[2:48:32] Thurman__1: that would be an insane troll lol
[2:48:34] CALOT_ROGUE: When do you think Blizz will announce stuff about Phase 2 officially?

[2:48:39] madgarlicjr: i got 10k into revered on two toons but i my sub ran out about a week ago and i don't plan on resubbing utnil phase 2
[2:48:51] acrasieae: there will be 100%
[2:48:51] Lionkingler1: KEKW would be crazy power creep if the exalted ones arent bis
[2:48:52] DBGmal: inc crafted bracers KEKW
[2:48:53] NutterCircus: Judging from how the Wayland supplies work, you know Blizz is huge Trolls.

[2:49:20] acrasieae: i hope they add epic engi goggles
[2:49:20] divadnothsa: And you get multiple phase pre bis
[2:49:21] Thurman__1: highly doubt there will be epic bracers in a level 40 raid though
[2:49:23] capybaras17: how much of the wrath population do you think will play cata?
[2:49:30] rsSilence: I don't give a shit if the bracers are orders of magnitude better than what's in the raid I'm not getting WSG exalted lmao
[2:49:30] Lionkingler1: you get prebis for 40/50 and 60 phase tho
[2:49:32] madgarlicjr: if devs aren't aware of the wsg rep reward bracer situation by now they aren't doing their job
[2:49:43] Robbtuck: warsong tabard makes the grind worth it for sure
[2:49:46] seksmuhchine: don't spend 40g on bracer
[2:49:56] technoclerk: it just makes sense to farm exalted with warsong outriders p1 so you can spam AB in p2
[2:50:00] RanciusAdventures: tabards ew
[2:50:01] Mauraderss: @staysafetv I saw in Canadian news there was a 700k truck convoy heading for Texas. is that a thing?
[2:50:03] CALOT_ROGUE: Warsong tabard is BIS
[2:50:08] mazian4: If you have the epic bracers people are more likely to invite you
[2:50:18] Thurman__1: you can just get an easy 1k wsg  each week with the drums quest

[3:41:10] Doribob1: thats the wildest take ive ever heard
[3:41:10] weebpulper: is that thing that ppl argue?
[3:41:11] NutterCircus: Hypocrites.
[3:41:13] gotcha2157: @Plathyy to each their own, my son not yours, no need to be rude right?
[3:41:17] purpledrank210: Go ask those weirdos if they'd be for 13 year old hormonal treatment, but be against 13 year olds having tattoos.
[3:41:18] ws_dmd: because a 13 year old doesn’t have a fully formed pre frontal cortex. circumcision doesn’t fundamentally change a person
[3:41:19] 21Khal: Good point
[3:41:21] verrack714: @LuxLuminis not in 2024
[3:41:22] pretty_cool_guy: everyone knows that cavemen circumsized themselves because it was cleaner
[3:41:22] Bronloch: GENESIS - 11 You are to undergo circumcision, and it will be the sign of the covenant between me and you. 12 For the generations to come every male among you who is eight days old must be circumcised, including those born in your household or bought with money from a foreigner—those who are not your offspring. 13 Whether born in your household or bought with your money, they must be circumcised. My covenant in your flesh is to be an everlasting covenant.
[3:41:25] seksmuhchine: i agree but
[3:41:26] boostedeg93: yes
[3:41:32] LuxLuminis: I'll stick with being cut and able to produce children.

[3:41:44] pretty_cool_guy: monkaX
[3:41:45] Razor9mm: Literally just clean the foreskin. Why the fuck do cut guys think it's not possible?
[3:41:45] DuoX: it is a hygeine issue if we didn't have access to today cleaning
[3:41:53] NutterCircus: They will give you 1000 reasons why to get circumsized, but they never have pros of not getting.
[3:41:55] Lionkingler1: YEP thats the fallacy
[3:41:56] arsenalenjoyer: already did
[3:41:56] madgarlicjr: oh yeah i want headphone ears

[3:42:14] DuoX: i want my penis ready for the apocalypse personally
[3:42:15] weebpulper: muslims were some of the cleanest ppl. it's why they didn't get the plague

[3:42:21] Zorbotic_: barbaric? im actually laughing so hard rn LUL
[3:42:22] DuoX: yours won't be
[3:42:22] weebpulper: pple were really clean forever
[3:42:23] Razor9mm: This is why circumcised guys actually do deserve to be bullied. They always defend it like retards
[3:42:24] funweekenddad: My cut brothers will never truly know how good sex feels. RIP to the homies nerve endings.
[3:42:24] Probulator: cutting the foreskin doesnt change the function though
[3:42:26] madgarlicjr: stds
[3:42:27] Plathyy: @gotcha2157 i think if you saw it for what it was,  cutting off something unnecessarily and putting babies through distress when they didn't have to, you would raise and issue with people doing it as well.
[3:42:29] Arcsilin: money
[3:42:29] ws_dmd: circumcision is a religious thing
[3:42:38] baddaboomer: as a non circumcised, your son will thank you

[3:42:46] Respawnlord: some have really smelly feet, lets cut 'em off
[3:42:48] Arcsilin: who make these rules
[3:42:48] wagyu_88: Masterbation is great for colon health.
[3:42:51] NaManDatAintMe: pretty sure its religious
[3:42:54] WhySoSerious04: as a circumsized your child will thank you
[3:42:55] Vehicle_King: turns out they were wrong
[3:42:56] Plathyy: @gotcha2157 unless of course you're jewish, then i actually don't care
[3:42:58] NutterCircus: No, it is because the Muslims make their prisoners pull down their pants to see who was Jewish.
[3:42:58] Garvickian: so around when israel became a nation
[3:42:59] unscconnor2: @StaysafeTV you have the flag dude
[3:43:03] WhySoSerious04: I don’t want smegma
[3:43:07] shockums: @StaysafeTV  thanks for sayin it, and being educated on the topic lol
[3:43:11] Dylan_wayne420: didn't work

[3:43:21] fitrick: @Plathyy KEKW
[3:43:24] jimbonni: I know many people in Europe who do this with their children because of their faith
[3:43:24] OdeedOG: id have callus on my shit
[3:43:24] Buttsworth: whats this thing ah duh
[3:43:26] seksmuhchine: ahhh some shmegma
[3:43:34] Bronloch: THEY MUST CIRCUMCISE THEIR SLAVES AS PART OF THEIR CONTRACT WITH GOD ITS THEIR LAW
[3:43:42] Maruika: for every person that follows god cancels one baby circumcision
[3:43:42] Pimplejewce: no way a kid getting cut like that is good for the brain
[3:43:43] calbisie: and what about people with phimosis?
[3:43:44] CasualCooky: My parents told me it was because they were advised it is more clean, had nothing to do with religion though
[3:43:45] WhySoSerious04: hahah no circumsized guy ever said man I wish I wasn’t cut
[3:43:47] lostinthasauce23: circumcision is like modifying a Ferrari
[3:43:55] Dgafknight: what do you get when exalted?
[3:43:59] verrack714: why is porn free in usa? didnt some country do that in the middle east to disable thecountry?
[3:44:01] Probulator: I wear the foreskins of my conquered foes like rings
[3:44:02] Lionkingler1: YEP correct
[3:44:03] ws_dmd: idk how you can actually be for 13 year olds doing sex changes. every 13 year old is curious about the other gender, doesn’t mean they are the other gender
[3:44:07] Zorbotic_: @WhySoSerious04 lol exactly
[3:44:07] funweekenddad: Google it
[3:44:18] LuxLuminis: Circumcision is tantamount to scarification though. It doesn't have a significant impact on us functionally the way hormone therapy would.
[3:44:24] Lionkingler1: YEP have a friend with it
[3:44:24] TurboBased: less that 1% have that problem so cut off 100% of foreskins Pepega
[3:44:27] only499atkfc: @WhySoSerious04 there's an entire process for guys who try to restore it. Yeah, they do
[3:44:32] 1Horsepower: Staysafe quick with the encylopedic penis knowledge and statistic figures monkaHmm
[3:44:33] NotDessx: that's covid rates of preventative
[3:44:34] LuxLuminis: "male circumcision is a preventative measure for an array of pathologies including reduced risks of penile cancer, urinary tract infections, sexually transmitted diseases, and even cervical cancer in sexual partners."
[3:44:36] nishdj: YO WHAT IS UP
[3:44:36] Varren__: rip out all the prostates! you might get cancer!
[3:44:38] Sweaty__Betty: physiological phimosis is always present before puberty
[3:44:42] DuoX: ya but what about aerodynamics staysafe
[3:44:49] TurboBased: there are botches foreskin removals as well
[3:44:53] TurboBased: botched
[3:44:54] fitrick: The defense of this stuff is so surreal it really makes you realise how sick the people who pushed this shit are
[3:44:57] Sweaty__Betty: it improves as the person ages and usually resolves by puberty
[3:45:02] Arcsilin: 100 percent
[3:45:04] ws_dmd: I think the argument is apples to oranges. circumcision does not has the same ramifications as a sex change
[3:45:05] XarcTV: yep
[3:45:05] WhySoSerious04: all these uncut ant eaters so sad they aren’t cut
[3:45:10] Vehicle_King: last longer EZ

[3:45:20] CasualCooky: The ladies like it cause you last longer Kappa
[3:45:20] Arcsilin: @WhySoSerious04 lol what?
[3:45:25] madgarlicjr: at this point its just a part of the health care industry that has been baked into the system and theres now way to stop it
[3:45:28] gotcha2157: @Plathyy  not jewish lol. imo theres more pros than cons. but you did not get ti done with your child and i got it done with mine. thats makes me them our own individual children
[3:45:29] only499atkfc: @LuxLuminis you missed the part of that statement, where it said "TRADITIONALLY" ... love how you're intentionally misquoting
[3:45:34] XarcTV: @WhySoSerious04 think your a bit upset hahaha
[3:45:43] jimbonni: bro SWAPing HORMONS IS FUCKT UP
[3:45:43] WhySoSerious04: upset nah bro

[3:45:52] NaManDatAintMe: yeah its easy just get a new dick sown on
[3:45:53] ws_dmd: let’s say you do hormonal therapy, might as well toss in 6 anti depressant or anxiolytic medications
[3:45:53] kingpincognito: God doesn't love coomers.
[3:45:53] NaManDatAintMe: ez
[3:45:53] kaiju_kin: there is no objective, reasonable argument to support circumcision
[3:45:58] Pimplejewce: @gotcha2157 bro your kid is getting his dick cut
[3:46:02] NutterCircus: Yer forskin was used to make a pair or shoes or wallet. DansGame
[3:46:05] arsenalenjoyer: having your foreskin removed isnt life altering though
[3:46:06] jimbonni: thats just siick

[3:46:52] kingpincognito: tyrannical
[3:46:53] carlos_the_7th: hahaha loser got rekt
[3:46:54] Plathyy: @gotcha2157 you would argue against african girls getting "circumsized" and would probably feel very strongly about people adopting such customs in the US, i feel similarly to people doing it to little boys already which is why i speak up about it
[3:46:56] QuestFor420: i almost ran my toe over with my chair monkaS
[3:46:59] tuggiesFTW: You know what they say about uncircumcised guys, they're complete dicks.
[3:47:01] Djalextv98: whats ur opinion on opinions? @StaysafeTV
[3:47:01] Maruika: we should invest in silicone foreskin sleeves for people so they can get the feeling back
[3:47:01] r_kramerz: Do you feel the same against Vaccines then for your scenario?
[3:47:02] Bronloch: GENITAL MUTILATION OF MINORS IS WRONG FULL STOP
[3:47:05] Sawfthandz: Boycot Sandra Bullock for using foreskin lotion
[3:47:06] devilsaurmafia: he was probably a foreskin surgeron
[3:47:07] fitrick: @gotcha2157 What does me not having kids have to do with you being a child abuser?
[3:47:08] devilsaurmafia: surgeon*
[3:47:09] only499atkfc: @LuxLuminis here's the rest of that article for you. the American Academy of Paediatrics (AAP) Taskforce on Circumcision affirms that although current scientific evidence demonstrates potential benefits of neonatal male circumcision, the data is not substantial enough to recommend routine neonatal circumcision.
[3:47:12] lostinthasauce23: what about the risk of complications too? For something that is literally pointless
[3:47:22] twojimmystv: imagine not being circumcised, gross
[3:47:27] chiief: @Bronloch take a deep breath
[3:47:32] Buttsworth: @twojimmystv COPE
[3:47:35] 1Horsepower: Did we every figure out what those berries were from a few days ago?
[3:47:46] LuxLuminis: @only499atkfc Welcome to the medical field where most data is inconclusive.
[3:47:50] Arcsilin: @1Horsepower hahah\
[3:47:54] Faramar: one of the few takes i have to disagree with you staysafe, circumcision is actually really important, it reduces chances of cancer, it reduces the chances of infection especially in children, reduces chance of STDs due to ripping of the foreskin, etc. but anyway, i think plenty of people get by without it as well
[3:47:55] fitrick: @twojimmystv Shalom
[3:48:02] weebpulper: essaying
[3:48:08] gotcha2157: @Plathyy  maybe i would, maybe i wouldn't. i don't know enough about that to give an opinion

[3:48:52] harvenius: @Faramar a person with no foreskin wrote this
[3:48:56] Lionkingler1: so when you wash your dick and balls in the shower you cannot pull the skin back for like 1 second and clean it????
[3:48:56] only499atkfc: @LuxLuminis May God have mercy on anyone you come into contact with
[3:48:57] Thurman__1: foreskin cancer?
[3:48:58] Maruika: i mean cutting off any piece of your body technically reduces cancer, he isnt wrong lmfao.

[3:49:20] LuxLuminis: @only499atkfc I run a faith-based practice. I'd hope He does. <3 And thank you.
[3:49:20] Hoagiesxd: WideSadge
[3:49:21] kodiak_1: it reduces your risk of having forskin caught in your zipper

[3:49:31] Lionkingler1: Cut off your hand and you cant get hand cancer Pog
[3:49:36] Sawfthandz: @StaysafeTV should we kill Sandra Bullock for using asian baby foreskin creams?
[3:49:37] weebpulper: peepoShake
[3:49:38] cthulhufthagn19: he might get brain cancer so he cut out his brain

[3:49:46] NaManDatAintMe: can do that when youre an infant
[3:49:47] Warriorfall: playing devil's advocate, it's more dangerous
[3:49:48] Plathyy: because jewish appendix face cream doesnt sell as well

[3:49:59] Harles_: @Plathyy KEKW
[3:50:01] LuxLuminis: I'd say appendectomies, regardless of how routine they are, are still much more dangerous than a circumcision.
[3:50:01] NutterCircus: @Plathyy PogU
[3:50:02] majorbloodlol: its purely cuz its in the talmud
[3:50:03] Bronloch: @Plathyy BASED

[3:50:04] 1Horsepower: monkaHmm
[3:50:05] LuxLuminis: Especially for a newborn.
[3:50:06] sixpackchad: @StaysafeTV i agree with you on the foreskin take, but appendectomy is a lot more invasive than circumcision
[3:50:06] harvenius: @seksmuhchine because the west is hypocritical, and criticises other cultures while doing the same shit lol
[3:50:06] churpx: remove all female breasts so they cant get cancer
[3:50:10] Thurman__1: are you circumcised?
[3:50:16] WhySoSerious04: appendix helps with immune system
[3:50:19] spike82q: its cleaner, if their unhygenic
[3:50:19] NutterCircus: I like Cathy 😍
[3:50:23] dirk_Sora: and testicles, they get cancer
[3:50:23] Garvickian: do you think they are harvesting stem cells from the circumcisions
[3:50:28] madgarlicjr: society can have bad habits it struggles to change just as an individual does
[3:50:29] Faramar: it's just preventatives, removing foreskin is equivalent of removing wisdom teeth
[3:50:29] Radtvlol: tell us anyway :)

[3:51:01] bigwank69: @StaysafeTV Genesis 17:9-14 says your sons should be circumcised for the covenant of God
[3:51:02] sticksaredrifting: LUL
[3:51:06] Bronloch: GENITAL MUTILATION IS WRONG
[3:51:10] 1Horsepower: Hes 100% Jeremy Renner mode down there until proven otherwise
[3:51:12] Plathyy: and any men that wants to be circumsized can go ahead and do it now if it bothers him so much
[3:51:20] LuxLuminis: I actually do agree that we should revisit the idea of circumcision and educate parents on it more but I do not believe that it is comparable to hormone therapy for preteens and teens.
[3:51:22] arsenalenjoyer: I am happy i dont have mine
[3:51:27] easyafff: do you have your skin
[3:51:27] jimbonni: dman hurts D

[3:51:49] iknowido: niky hailey was swatted
[3:51:51] NutterCircus: If that happened, they would probably have a full class in public education to promote circumcision.
[3:51:53] Bronloch: face cream NEEDS foreskins
[3:51:56] madgarlicjr: i wonder if there is plastic surgery to ad forskin back
[3:52:03] 1Horsepower: They could do circumcisions at cigar stores so you could do both on your 18th birthday and use that same little tool
[3:52:04] seksmuhchine: my penis is only 18cm
[3:52:06] kaiju_kin: yes

[3:52:55] Highkriger: I wish i could sleep Deadge
[3:52:56] letsgetgoingyo: its a defense mechanism or a type of protection bias, if you are cut, you want to justify it
[3:52:59] Plathyy: @Chunkynay are you american?
[3:53:00] KingDaDa1011: If I wasnt cut I would never make a decision to have my dick skin cut off, but I never had the choice and Im used to it and Im fine with it

[3:58:36] Thurman__1: are you familiar with end times prophecy? you should pay attention to the troubles in the middle east right now

[4:00:47] madgarlicjr: Christos is a boy's name of Greek and Latin origins, meaning “follower of Christ” and “bearing Christ.” This name is a unique variant of the Latin “Christian” and the Greek “Khristos” and “Christopher.” Christos is a true Greek classic, and the name is abundant in the Greek version of the New Testament.

[4:03:45] LiquidAyla: fuck sakes, Im a 31 year old white male. I feel so at home here and I love it
[4:03:48] rsSilence: Evangelicals support Israel because it's a pretty widely held belief that a massive war in the Middle East is one of the final signs to herald the return of Christ. They believe by supporting Israel they're immanentizing the Eschaton.
[4:03:52] seksmuhchine: i'm technically catholic

[4:04:59] ATcaribou: i only say it (and do it) if you have shared with me something that could be prayed for
[4:04:59] LiquidAyla: they have to be sitting on a self proclaimed pedestal
[4:05:00] chasegapo: As a Christian I pray for people all the time.
[4:05:04] rsSilence: Almost all Christians mean it, the vast majority of Christians pray for those that hate them or are led astray.
[4:05:06] WhySoSerious04: that’s why we preach. becuase I don’t want anyone not to go to heaven
[4:05:07] FriendmanBrother: BAPTIST

[4:05:19] Humansoup: That's Bad yes
[4:05:20] Thurman__1: nope

[4:05:39] NutterCircus: The beauty is God lets you Judge Yourself when you pass.
[4:05:41] kaiju_kin: just ask for forgiveness

[4:14:29] Raivan994: asmon fell off
[4:14:29] Vehicle_King: @chasegapo we need less businessmen that sell out the country. And we need better politicians, but people seem to vote against their best interests all the time, so that wont happen
[4:14:29] synyster_hs: asmon is based isn't he?
[4:14:37] luzid7: where did they say that with changing something with the premades?

[4:18:09] kalrick1: we need schizo tonight
[4:18:11] Probulator: holocaust time again?

[4:22:06] Nightbot: NEW SOD VIDEO: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ir9uYRdcYuI&
[4:22:12] chasegapo: The media has made it that way, which is sad. I really don't think so many people would be anti-trump if it weren't for our paid and bought news stations

[4:22:52] drunk_hunk: @synyster_hs i did as well in 2012 does not feel nearly as bad as voting for hillary imo
[4:23:00] chasegapo: American News stations have done an insane amount of damage to this country + public school systems.
[4:23:14] ImNiceLikeThat: @Bronloch trump used to be a democrat what are you smoking
[4:23:16] BLUNDERGUN: cant you only have 5
[4:23:24] Utmost777: bag space

[4:24:18] Thurman__1: what if the ones you buy now are level capped
[4:24:18] divadnothsa: If you will get rank 14 worth it
[4:24:20] Rejuvasaur: yoooo staysafe are we going to be in Tehran by summer? Should I start getting in draft shape? lol
[4:24:20] TrueSmugg: how do you get the chronoboon things, does a profession make them?
[4:24:21] weebpulper: it does feel like presidential elections have become a celebrity show. I'd prefer to be more invested in local policies
[4:24:35] seksmuhchine: manipulate the maarket like ur saying
[4:24:35] FriendmanBrother: i think duo dungeons with a healer could be optimal
[4:24:43] Utmost777: pvp is going to be annoying the first few weeks

[4:25:15] Thurman__1: will people be able to solo mobs in Ulda at 40?
[4:25:18] seksmuhchine: also fish in STV

[4:25:32] therealfwizzle: just gotta get ahead of the curve if you wanna quest
[4:25:39] Probulator: another reason phase 2 should be extended
[4:25:50] originmorii: wait rfk solo for leveling? or was it for some other reason
[4:25:53] linkitcraig: I need to find an aoe group or something as a priest

[4:27:33] LiquidAyla: Your enemy name plate addon is default Threatplates?!
[4:27:34] ATcaribou: i thought you had a bunch of marks saved up
[4:27:39] Thurman__1: phase 2 will last over 2 months. and the raid might be delayed. no real reason to speed level
[4:27:53] snoopy239: what talents do you use for pop?
[4:27:54] LiquidAyla: thanks - plater is still buggy
[4:27:55] snoopy239: pop*

[5:00:35] Taicho116: was the post about Russia saying they could sell arms to Texas and it wouldn't count as an act of war a joke or did they say that (even if jokingly)
[5:00:44] seksmuhchine: missile on a cycle
[5:00:44] Garvickian: true tho revolution can never happen if they just use drones
[5:00:51] Bronloch: LUL PLEASE MISSILE STRIKE TEXANS AND SEE WHAT HAPPENS LUL

[5:01:24] Thurman__1: you'd see an actual insurrection
[5:01:34] Snaketrap: monkaCOPTER monkaCOPTER monkaSTEER monkaCOPTER monkaCOPTER
[5:01:44] ATcaribou: its one thing for some rando to say, its next level fucked up for a state politician to say it
[5:01:45] Probulator: seeing Nancy Pelosi saying pro cease fire protestors was russian collusion was funny
[5:01:59] Metaphix: want to get ok city? thats how you get ok city
[5:02:00] seksmuhchine: raptors
[5:02:02] SsxD_: i mean have fun fighting against one of the largest armies in the world. and if you think " americans wouldnt bomb their own kind " ur as delusional as the texans
[5:02:07] 1Horsepower: @SsxD_ yeah good point Afghans werent able to do that at all. Oh wait...
[5:02:16] seksmuhchine: eagles
[5:02:30] summatown31: Druid looked like he over extended then bounces real quick
[5:02:31] Vehicle_King: Texas isnt gonna do shit. So not sure why people even entertain the thought.
[5:02:32] Electroblazer: It's weird to me how a ton of people think a civil war would have like state borders it'd be so chaotic irl
[5:02:35] Lionkingler1: KEKL
[5:02:37] Garvickian: it would work if they committed to it, guns on the ground arent shit against drones
[5:02:38] Metaphix: neither did the taliban :tf:
[5:02:40] NotASkiller: USA USA USA
[5:02:44] ATcaribou: im so confused, are AR15s weapons of war, or completely innefective to fight a war?
[5:02:49] KingTarro: toyota trucks win wars
[5:02:49] Bronloch: YOU CANT ENFORCE HOUSE ARREST WITH TANKS AND FIGHTER PLANES LUL
[5:02:53] Lionkingler1: about to glas texas KEKW
[5:02:56] Zaziben: if people die over this border crisis shit we have failed as  anation
[5:03:02] fn_rd: perfect time to tune in
[5:03:04] TurboBased: the fact that our politicians would say anything like that tells us a lot
[5:03:23] tuggiesFTW: Aren't F-16s designed for air-to-air combat?
[5:03:24] seksmuhchine: i mean an f-16 is badass
[5:03:27] Vehicle_King: If this wasnt an election year with a chance at a Repub winning the WH, you wouldnt even be hearing about the border
[5:03:27] fn_rd: excuse me streamer i hear you needed some f-16s? *opens jacket*
[5:03:41] SsxD_: isnt this why 2nd amendmant texans so proud? arent they ready for the civil war?
[5:03:42] chiief: GIGACHAD dark biden
[5:03:45] Bronloch: OH you mean the military that got its ass kicked for 20 YEARS by fucking goat herders? LUL
[5:04:03] SuaSponte: occupation with motivated guerilla forces is nearly impossbible, no way the government would do anything to citizens.  not to mention have the soldiers family would be the targets and would quit
[5:04:11] SuaSponte: half*
[5:04:15] Metaphix: only LARPers say they do
[5:04:25] Bronloch: VietCong/Taliban showed exactly how to fight overconfident tanks and planes
[5:04:26] arsenalenjoyer: I don't think your ar-15 can put up much of a fight against a f-16
[5:04:31] seksmuhchine: yeah f-16s are made to shoot migs
[5:04:58] 1Horsepower: @arsenalenjoyer tell that to Iraq and Afghanistan
[5:05:04] NotASkiller: why would they close the border when the US needs immigrants to do construction and farm work
[5:05:11] rubbadubdubby: SOD phase 2 is just 1 step closer to retail
[5:05:14] ATcaribou: @arsenalenjoyer in order for that to be a reasonable argument, you have to be willing to believe that the US government would bomb its own cities in the even of political unrest.
[5:05:14] Zaziben: it's still not the job of texas to police the border is the argument
[5:05:16] Vehicle_King: While R's are distracted by the border, they forget the R platform has no policy to actually help them. Keep consuming the propaganda.
[5:05:41] Electroblazer: If a civil war did happen large parts of the military would just switch allegiance to various sides
[5:05:48] Electroblazer: ideological sides
[5:05:50] spike82q: 1/2 way through ph2 wsg ded content for most ?
[5:05:52] Thurman__1: an army of gorillas?
[5:05:57] Lionkingler1: carpet bombing
[5:05:58] Metaphix: if you go balls out you turn everyone against you
[5:06:02] Bronloch: @arsenalenjoyer you dont know modern warfare! LUL the vietcong used to lay down head to foot and shoulder to shoulder with 45 pistols and muskets and any gun they could get their hands on and shoot down Huey FUCKING Cobra helicopters in Vietnam! LUL
[5:06:08] SsxD_: yes its phase 2 lvl 40 hunters doign the insurection
[5:06:09] ATcaribou: @spike82q yeah, if you want exalted, you want to do it now
[5:06:11] SsxD_: gorrila war stomp
[5:06:13] Thurman__1: armored gorillas
[5:06:16] Garvickian: all that guerilla warfare was america going into completely different terrain without as much tech
[5:06:19] nob4242: @Vehicle_King as if the D plan is working ?
[5:06:24] rubbadubdubby: we should prison all of the business owners who employ illegal immigrants in texas
[5:06:29] SuaSponte: especially when you have an entire generation of combat veterans in the population haha
[5:06:33] NotASkiller: there won't be civil war. government would quickly label anyone who disagrees as a rebel or terrorist
[5:06:33] 1Horsepower: We need to send forces into Un Goro crater immediately
[5:06:45] Snaketrap: YEP
[5:06:49] seksmuhchine: crazy
[5:06:49] Bronloch: EXACTLY
[5:06:55] Metaphix: it's a LARP
[5:06:56] ScarfaceCEO: Very out of touch with reality people .
[5:07:03] SsxD_: its crazy to think you can fight against the government
[5:07:09] SsxD_: its not the 1800's anymore
[5:07:09] nob4242: civil war time is when the rest of our enemies pounce on us too
[5:07:10] Zaziben: America would be fucked if we did that, especially comparted to the other nations wathcing
[5:07:15] NutterCircus: The Media wants to amp it up.
[5:07:27] arsenalenjoyer: China would love a US Civil War
[5:07:28] Mimir_x: Not to mention Russia and China would not turna blind eye to that chance
[5:07:36] NutterCircus: It i legitimately inevitable though.
[5:07:37] Garvickian: only way a revolution h appens is if the police/army revolt also
[5:07:37] Bronloch: Civil War would be devastation beyond belief in this modern age and so threatening Texans to keep open ILLEGAL CROSSING points is pure stupidity!
[5:07:37] Phalloides60: i dont want it but see it as inevitable and id rather it happen sooner rather than later
[5:07:45] arsenalenjoyer: Civil War 2 sounds like a new marvel film
[5:07:46] NotASkiller: @nob4242 civil war vs the entire US army backed by the military industrial complex? good luck lol
[5:07:47] Lionkingler1: arent there some polls on that topic
[5:07:49] Zaziben: being sole world police would end instantly
[5:07:54] Thurman__1: @SsxD_ thats what the 2nd amendment was originally for lol
[5:08:02] boinky27: all it would take to decimate big cities is a couple transport trucks to block bridges/highways going in/out
[5:08:04] mattbarz989: has warlock always been your main
[5:08:05] 1Horsepower: Lindsay Graham just tweeted we need to send men to Un Goro Crater immediately to quell this gorilla uprising
[5:08:10] nob4242: @NotASkiller you missed the point.  it wasnt pro civil war
[5:08:15] mattykek: Can I play WoW during a civil war?
[5:08:20] spike82q: imagine texas its own country gdp is bigger than most countries
[5:08:22] SsxD_: @SsxD_ yeah gl with ur gun against an ac130
[5:08:23] Metaphix: our quality of life is nowhere near bad enough for a civil war. In Syria it took cops abducting, murdering, and torturing ppls kids for shit talking the regime
[5:08:25] seksmuhchine: i see the same pattern
[5:08:28] Zaziben: the military could easily fracture and fight eachother too
[5:08:31] Vehicle_King: Russia/China stirring the pot online and getting retards to divide themselves.
[5:08:32] CYBERDEMON6669: I feel like the people that say they want civil war is bc they want the divide to end and they see that as the inevitable thing that will happen
[5:08:34] Lionkingler1: divide and conquer YEP
[5:08:42] itsae__: cockfight
[5:08:46] arsenalenjoyer: kick the libs out YEP
[5:08:49] Arcsilin: ww3 will happen befoer any of taht
[5:08:53] rubbadubdubby: shouldnt we enforce stricter punishment against texas business owners who employ these immigrants?
[5:08:56] BinksMagnus: @Zaziben will not happen.
[5:08:59] NutterCircus: The closer we get the more disinformation will be spread. People wont know what is up or down.
[5:09:00] boinky27: @SsxD_ this is such a dumb talking point
[5:09:02] seksmuhchine: write me a check
[5:09:11] speedzombie: heres hoping warlocks get better in pvp next phase
[5:09:26] Vehicle_King: @rubbadubdubby Not just Texas, all states. But neither side is willing to. wonder why
[5:09:26] Bronloch: Ukrainians are taking out brand new MIG fucking fighter jets with $250 drones! LUL Old School military is outdated and useless for anything but leveling cities
[5:09:27] dumblane: real discussions while tearing it up in battlegrounds
[5:09:34] kingpincognito: How fast do you think Blizzard would ban Texas IPs if we seceded?
[5:09:36] Thurman__1: @SsxD_ who do you think mans those ac130's?
[5:09:44] SsxD_: @boinky27 right, and thinking that you stand a chance against a military that is feared world wide isnt. you think the bootlickers wont shoot you as instructed?
[5:10:00] boinky27: @SsxD_ im not even american bud
[5:10:02] SsxD_: @thurman__1 lots of good soldiers folow orders, stop thinking they wont
[5:10:06] seksmuhchine: what does that mean
[5:10:09] NotASkiller: @thurman__1 people loyal to the govt
[5:10:11] arsenalenjoyer: any ramp runners?
[5:10:11] Thurman__1: @SsxD_ you think the US army would bomb US citizens? lol
[5:10:12] DuoX: if texas left, florida would leave, then alabama , then a bunch of widwest states
[5:10:17] Nightbot: NEW SOD VIDEO: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ir9uYRdcYuI&
[5:10:23] NutterCircus: I wonder how many of these Austin TX twitch streamers support Texas.
[5:10:27] DuoX: ppl  can pretend a civil war couldn't happen but it could
[5:10:28] seksmuhchine: Ti are good calculators
[5:10:33] NotASkiller: @thurman__1 if they label them as domestic terrorists yes
[5:10:33] SsxD_: @thurman__1 as a whole? no. will some follow orders and do what they are told.
[5:10:34] spike82q: south vs north again
[5:10:34] Thurman__1: @SsxD_ not happening
[5:10:34] boinky27: it wouldnt
[5:10:39] DuoX: military would split instantly
[5:10:41] Vehicle_King: The laws to protect the border already exist. Neither side enforces them. If R's fix it, then they cant use that during election years. And Dems just fight over pronouns and privilege.
[5:10:46] papaw4w4: hard times create strong men, strong men create good times.
[5:10:47] SsxD_: you see it with people dick riding bad cops.
[5:10:48] fn_rd: there would be a lot of mutiny and defection yes
[5:10:50] Snaketrap: monkaCOPTER
[5:10:50] kaiju_kin: the gov destroying its own source of income.... right
[5:10:57] rubbadubdubby: @Vehicle_King The current immigrant issue is centered around texas
[5:10:59] boinky27: the army has been clowned against third would countries last 20 years
[5:11:02] SsxD_: it wouldnt be " kill civs" it would be  " we need to stop this divide"
[5:11:03] Probulator: military branches might be taken down from within
[5:11:04] Metaphix: ppl seem to think it would be citizens vs army in an open field humans vs tanks lol
[5:11:07] papaw4w4: good time create weak men weak men create hard times.
[5:11:13] SsxD_: you think the propoganda shit wouldnt be put up?
[5:11:14] BinksMagnus: none of the officers are going to insubordinate.
[5:11:20] 1Horsepower: People in the military are too busy figuring out their next V6 Challenger 30% interest payment to worry about civil war
[5:11:21] SsxD_: they not just saying " shoot civs"
[5:11:22] hardknox187: Ya thats definitely the problem, too many military DFACs
[5:11:22] NotASkiller: not if u label the citizens as traitors and domestic terrorists. then they are basically giving up their citizenship
[5:11:25] seksmuhchine: whom has the boomers
[5:11:26] SsxD_: they saying " stop this madness "
[5:11:27] DuoX: I've met generals that would instantly defect and troops are more loyal to their general than their president.
[5:11:27] SuaSponte: and every veteran (which we have a ton of) was trained by that very military and knows their tactics and bases etc inside and out haha
[5:11:32] Bronloch: tanks and planes cant enforce guerrillas who meld into and out of populations
[5:11:34] Lionkingler1: people dont care and arent aware what implications civil war has
[5:11:35] Metaphix: fuel deliveries
[5:11:43] Vehicle_King: @Vehicle_King I'm aware. But they dont all stay in Texas. Plenty of other states hire illegals to keep wages low for Americans.
[5:11:44] Thurman__1: @SsxD_ too many pro freedom citizens in the US. wouldn't happen anytime soon
[5:11:52] SsxD_: @thurman__1 keep thinking that
[5:11:56] kingpincognito: Navy just reduced their requirements again because of lack of recruitment.
[5:11:57] spike82q: so your aying theres Oil
[5:11:58] Garvickian: takes one expensive drone controlled by the government to kill hundreds
[5:12:01] Arcsilin: who would you be killing anyway
[5:12:02] seksmuhchine: the nuke subs
[5:12:03] Vehicle_King: Anyone advocating for Civil War should be publicly executed.
[5:12:04] the_poon_monsoon: im both
[5:12:08] arsenalenjoyer: Captain America: Civil War 2 coming summer 2024!
[5:12:12] Arcsilin: whos to kill in this civil war
[5:12:12] boinky27: implying some general wouldnt general franco it
[5:12:20] Wingsofjanitor: if you're the former, you should type it in chat PauseChamp
[5:12:20] Arcsilin: makes no sense
[5:12:22] sweatlordkush: WHOOO!!!!!
[5:12:29] fviii: @Wingsofjanitor PauseChamp
[5:12:29] Wingsofjanitor: you definitely won't get banned for it
[5:12:29] NutterCircus: The best thing to do is just be prepared for worse case and be thankful your preperations are never needed.
[5:12:30] 1Horsepower: @Garvickian "the government" doesn't pilot drones, people do
[5:12:32] Plathyy: I can't fathom that there is enough people that would even stand for the side of open borders
[5:12:33] DuoX: @Vehicle_King crap take. half the found fathers outright promoted regular revolution to remain free
[5:12:34] sweatlordkush: JUST LIKE MY MARVEL MOVIES POGGIES
[5:12:35] DaGreenGiant: Can I be both, but still not want civil war?
[5:12:36] dumblane: how braindead is sod pvp on scale of 1-10
[5:12:44] Thurman__1: @SsxD_ so who would be leading the charge? The Dems?
[5:12:45] BinksMagnus: "advocating" is strong, but what's the alternative? one political faction gets to completely ignore the commands of the federal government in their states and do whatever they want? that's unhinged
[5:12:50] ryufromstreets6: @the_poon_monsoon say it clearly and with your chest
[5:12:53] sweatlordkush: biden is captain america Poggers
[5:12:57] Arcsilin: @dumblane about a 6.5
[5:12:58] NotASkiller: if you go against the government every news station and newspaper would immediately start labeling you a domestic terrorist and it's over. you're a traitor to your country
[5:13:00] arsenalenjoyer: so many non military people in the chat lmao
[5:13:09] SsxD_: @thurman__1 everyone not with texas? and even some who stand with them now would flip quickly. you think the fat cows would give up their silver plater
[5:13:16] rubbadubdubby: @arsenalenjoyer who cares about the military, its just an underpaid job
[5:13:22] Vehicle_King: @Vehicle_King But we are free. Just because Texas doesnt like the Democrat in the WH doesnt mean a civil war is the answer. jesus christ KEKL
[5:13:23] dustydollars2121: @Plathyy its less than you think... they want us to believe biden is the most popular president in history but it is FARRR from the truth trust
[5:13:27] SsxD_: @thurman__1 you are exactly what the government wants, guy who thinks he has power, you dont. you do as you are told.
[5:13:30] NotASkiller: @rubbadubdubby say that to a veteran
[5:13:38] Bronloch: i just find extremely arrogant for these non military people to call for missiles and tanks to be used on American civilians!
[5:13:42] DuoX: until Abraham Lincoln ppl's loyalty was to their state not the federal government.
[5:13:49] NutterCircus: Then you have one side that believes there is something to fight for.
[5:13:50] SsxD_: the government gives you as little freedom as you think you have
[5:13:55] rubbadubdubby: @NotASkiller i dont intermingle with them cuz i have a job
[5:14:01] Utmost777: The Federal Gov works for the States, that is how the Constitution was written
[5:14:04] asleepnotwoke: But but but Q said patriots are in control
[5:14:23] SsxD_: im hearing a lot of " in a perfect world " talk
[5:14:24] PabloTheFlapmaster: SeemsGood
[5:14:27] Thurman__1: @SsxD_ too many checks and balances in the US right now.
[5:14:30] 4wardsjack: is this a premade how do you have 2 priests?
[5:14:31] Vehicle_King: Besides tweeting, what have these 25 states done to "support" texas? Its optics for election year. You have to be blind to not see it.
[5:14:38] Zaziben: but then Biden looks weak
[5:14:40] NutterCircus: the people that support a corrupt lawless gov have nothing to fight for.
[5:14:45] CYBERDEMON6669: @BinksMagnus The states arent ignoring the commands of the federal government: Article IV, § 4, which promises that the federal government “shall protect each [State] against invasion,” and Article I, § 10, Clause 3, which acknowledges “the States’ sovereign interest in protecting their borders.”
[5:14:49] DrDeath30: ayaya
[5:15:14] originmorii: razor wire and spike traps in the water (among however many other things) are just objectively morally wrong and texas is in the wrong BASEDHALT
[5:15:17] arsenalenjoyer: I'm sending thoughts and prayers to texas
[5:15:20] sweatlordkush: OH YEA??? BUT REDDIT TOLD ME TEXAS IS IN THE WRONG
[5:15:22] Buttsworth: so ended up happening with the whole texas border standoff?
[5:15:22] Bronloch: Legally speaking its Texas' border not the federal govts border
[5:15:25] spike82q: america's "trucker Protest "
[5:15:27] Metaphix: KKona put sharks in the rio grande
[5:15:37] NutterCircus: Most of America would just find any conflict "Inconveinient."
[5:15:50] Utmost777: @originmorii you are a retard
[5:15:51] arsenalenjoyer: press 1 to send thoughts and prayers to texas KKona
[5:16:00] dustydollars2121: 1
[5:16:07] Probulator: wish California and Arizona would do something, but then again they are cartel owned
[5:16:08] TurboBased: trucker convoy starts tomorrow
[5:16:10] DrDeath30: 1
[5:16:13] NotASkiller: all this because people are unwilling to allow latinos to become legal workers and pay taxes
[5:16:13] Lionkingler1: 1
[5:16:15] asleepnotwoke: 1 = 1 like 1 prayer to texas
[5:16:15] ATcaribou: @originmorii those things are 100% avoidable. if people dont climb fences and swim the river. just stay away and nobody ever gets hurt by them
[5:16:20] Garvickian: nothing ever happens anyway
[5:16:26] sweatlordkush: but reddit told me that texas bad mmkay?
[5:16:26] Thurman__1: no ones bombing Texas anytime soon
[5:16:30] NutterCircus: Headin to Texas.
[5:16:36] kingpincognito: They use razor wire to protect most gov't compounds, is that morally wrong?
[5:16:57] arsenalenjoyer: so do the same thing he;s been doing his whole term?
[5:17:08] Vehicle_King: They arent going to kill Texans they are going to remove the wire.
[5:17:14] jakmko: What dispute?
[5:17:16] Thurman__1: thats a hard Impeach on Biden
[5:17:24] dustydollars2121: Pshero banned me from his chat for talking about commies LOL
[5:17:30] rubbadubdubby: somebody should remove the ramps so abbott cant get around
[5:17:31] BinksMagnus: that'd be the texans' fault
[5:17:33] TurboBased: one unfortunate incident is all it takes
[5:17:33] bots_bots: then texans are to blame...
[5:17:33] Zaziben: then they would have to use force on the feds
[5:17:36] Bronloch: WHY are the feds even suing to keep open an ILLEGAL border crossing point?
[5:17:40] Lionkingler1: whats the best move for biden to win the election? Thats what his handler will make him do
[5:17:43] DRONJET: gg
[5:17:45] Raewhen: The Shot Heard Round The World. Google It. Learn.
[5:17:47] originmorii: @originmorii hoy fuck what a dipshit take. actually causing psychic damage to me
[5:17:52] rubbadubdubby: texas is just 1 state
[5:17:53] NutterCircus: I think if there are any casualties, shit goes sideways.
[5:17:54] Thurman__1: Liberals don't understand optics
[5:17:57] DuoX: there are major air force bases in the southeast that would side with the south instantly ppl really need to take this situation seriously
[5:18:06] seksmuhchine: whomever is at fault
[5:18:08] Bronloch: THERE ARE FEDERAL DESIGNATED PORTS OF ENTRY
[5:18:24] Vehicle_King: The optics are it's Abbott stirring up shit to stay in power. SCOTUS said no wire. Law and order amiright.
[5:18:26] SsxD_: i think all the politicians are gonna go to a nice fancy dinner soon. your quick border control gets shoved to the side and in a few weeks the borders are back as open as before, you will be back at your rat cage job and forgot what ur overlords did
[5:18:29] rubbadubdubby: if texas cant secure its border, then the feds need to step in
[5:18:35] kingpincognito: If the feds did their job and policed the border, there would be no need for wire.
[5:18:37] magedotexe: the pogdog Pog
[5:18:37] mattykek: Know when to hold em... know when to fold em
[5:18:38] SKNARFN: killing american citizens for illegal immigrants would be great optics….
[5:19:01] Zaziben: @kingpincognito how do you they aren't doing that
[5:19:02] Thurman__1: I'm sure even Biden doesn't want that
[5:19:04] NutterCircus: If anyone died it would be at the fault of the Gov. Either way.
[5:19:26] CYBERDEMON6669: fed has legal obligation to protect states from invasion and to allow states to protect their borders, in the constitution
[5:19:29] ATcaribou: @Zaziben millions of annual illegal immigrants?
[5:19:31] Metaphix: @SKNARFN thats why Biden's not doing a lot right now. Optics of being the guy who forced open the borders
[5:19:33] originmorii: people who use legality to justify cruel repellants at the border ("well they should enter legally, then they could avoid it!") are actual retards who have shit morals
[5:19:37] bots_bots: isnt that what texas is doing
[5:19:39] arsenalenjoyer: libs are yess
[5:19:40] Lionkingler1: YEP 100% they are
[5:19:41] Taicho116: No one sent the army to break up sanctuary cities or stop people burning down the the courthouse in portland. You don't always do something
[5:19:41] Garvickian: if the gov killed people in texas libs would cheer it on
[5:19:47] BinksMagnus: civil war isn't the worst thing that could happen.
[5:19:54] Lionkingler1: YEP a hill they would literally die on
[5:19:55] rubbadubdubby: civil war never gonna happen, thats some 10/10 drama queen stuff
[5:19:58] ATcaribou: @originmorii so is there nowhere that should ever be protected with razor wire?
[5:20:01] NotASkiller: why don't we just help the Mexicans improve their country so they're not all trying to come here
[5:20:04] arsenalenjoyer: libs hate being wrong more than they like being right
[5:20:06] sweatlordkush: but but reddit told me texas is wrong
[5:20:10] Zaziben: @ATcaribou overstayed visas make up a huge portion of that number
[5:20:18] Metaphix: @rubbadubdubby never say never but yeah our quality of life is nowhere near bad enough for it
[5:20:19] dustydollars2121: @ATcaribou how can you say that when its already happened?
[5:20:19] seksmuhchine: why give the fed more power
[5:20:24] SsxD_: @NotASkiller its not even mexicans its south americans lmao out of touch
[5:20:29] bots_bots: isnt that literally what greg abbot is doing? he's just DARING biden to send the troops
[5:20:32] SsxD_: its not just " mecicans "
[5:20:36] mattbarz989: chip bitches
[5:20:41] ATcaribou: @Zaziben thats the federal governement failing to secure the border then
[5:20:43] SsxD_: some real brainiacs in the chat
[5:20:44] NutterCircus: Civil War started because HoseA wanted some of that sweet EBT. LUL
[5:20:44] SuaSponte: yeah man the political environment is so bad now.  in Sept 2001 the country was so united, then we had what 85% approval to go into Iraq at first?  nowadays if 9/11 happened libs would be like "hope it was 1500 repub or vice versa
[5:20:44] NotASkiller: @ssxd_ them they'd just chill in Mexico
[5:20:54] rubbadubdubby: @arsenalenjoyer i bet the $83M pay out your daddy trump has makes him feel good about right
[5:20:56] money_mafia_: But bro my Tio Juan and my tia Lupita and my cousin Jose and my friend from Iran Muhamad and all his boys still need to get through the border.
[5:21:07] Zaziben: @ATcaribou yes, and it's not abbot's job
[5:21:07] Thurman__1: I doubt Biden wants to send troops
[5:21:07] bots_bots: i think he wants biden to look weak
[5:21:11] Utmost777: He wants Biden do do is effing job
[5:21:14] rubbadubdubby: abbott is just a parasite in a wheelchair
[5:21:17] Electroblazer: We already have shootouts on the border from cartels :)
[5:21:18] bots_bots: it benefits them to have biden make the choice
[5:21:19] Metaphix: posse comitatus means he cant send federal troops, he would just federalize the tx national guard who are already there
[5:21:24] BinksMagnus: he wants biden to back down and look weak so trump can run on it
[5:21:24] ATcaribou: @dustydollars2121 im not sure what you mean, but if its morally repugnant to secure the border with razor wire, is it morally repugnant to secure military bases? prisons?
[5:21:25] arsenalenjoyer: @arsenalenjoyer HUH
[5:21:28] Vehicle_King: Abbott is purposefully antagonizing. Because the border riles up the Republican base. Its his best weapon to rally support.
[5:21:28] fiberi: abbott has the law on his side, its a lose-lose for biden no matter what happens
[5:21:30] SsxD_: lots of great politicians in chat, yall should run for office LUL
[5:21:39] bots_bots: ya true
[5:21:47] NutterCircus: Its nuts to believe and Open boarder is Humanitarian.
[5:21:49] Utmost777: the LARGEST border state
[5:21:50] arsenalenjoyer: imagine a country securing their border being so controversial
[5:21:59] Bronloch: The idea that they are coming nonstop and we cant stop them from coming is the dumbest defeatist attitude of them all ... the border is COMPLETELY enforceable and most countries have done this since the down of nationhood! LUL
[5:22:00] arsenalenjoyer: brain dead libas
[5:22:01] PazokiTV: if the feds had given this much effort to secure the border then it would have been secured LUL  they are aggressively making sure nothing is done about the border
[5:22:10] dustydollars2121: @ATcaribou i responded to the wrong person on accident lol misclicked the reply button
[5:22:10] rubbadubdubby: abbott just wants to get re-elected....wonder what would happen if abbott went after business owners who employed illegal immigrants! LOL
[5:22:11] spike82q: hopefully its all digital sounds liek to much paperwork
[5:22:12] Nightbot: NEW SOD VIDEO: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ir9uYRdcYuI&
[5:22:13] kingpincognito: @zaziben because I live here and my cousin is in the National Guard. His first deployment was to the border after basic and they pulled his entire unit 7mons ago. They're all sitting at home right now.
[5:22:19] ATcaribou: @dustydollars2121 ahh no worries
[5:22:25] NotASkiller: why do Republicans hate South Americans so much
[5:22:25] Zaziben: @NutterCircus no one is tlaking about open barders
[5:22:26] bots_bots: but isnt defying the feds like this the start of the escalation? like its the first step in the wrong direction
[5:22:48] arsenalenjoyer: @bots_bots states have rights
[5:22:55] Thurman__1: @NotASkiller do you know what happens to a lot of those south americans who try to cross illegally?
[5:22:55] CYBERDEMON6669: @bots_bots Texas isnt defying the fed.  Fed govt is failing their obligation as stated in constitution to protect states from invasion and allow states to protect their borders
[5:22:59] saund: hi good morning from the netherlands!
[5:23:00] fiberi: @bots_bots there's this thing called not following unlawful orders
[5:23:03] NutterCircus: @Zaziben So your belief is the US gov is not interfering in securing the border?
[5:23:05] Zaziben: @kingpincognito well then hopefully this fiasco forces biden to do hies job
[5:23:08] sweatlordkush: but but reddit told me texas is wrong and we NEED immigrants  to do the jobs americans wont do
[5:23:14] rubbadubdubby: @arsenalenjoyer how come they dont go after companies who employ illegal immigrants?
[5:23:29] dustydollars2121: I have info that would set this chat on fire..... more for a Rumble stream ;)
[5:23:29] speedzombie: 1 more hand in and you are done with WSG
[5:23:30] rubbadubdubby: @sweatlordkush its cuz white people are lazy LMAO
[5:23:37] NotASkiller: @thurman__1 let them enter legally and make them pay taxes
[5:23:39] SsxD_: right its joes fault lol
[5:23:39] bots_bots: thats not a step towards civil war
[5:23:44] Vehicle_King: Record number of apprehensions and returns. But the Border Patrol is doing nothing. KEKL
[5:23:45] arsenalenjoyer: @rubbadubdubby cope
[5:23:50] bots_bots: biden is fucking up the border situation for sure
[5:23:52] originmorii: texas would go to even more shit without illegal immigrants helping prop up their dumpsterfire of an economy. they should invest in making them legal members of society rather than install torture devices
[5:23:55] Thurman__1: @NotASkiller they can enter legally. but they're not
[5:23:57] Bronloch: THEY are letting all the illegals in so the society devolves to the point that every citizen will adopt Digital-ID and CBDC to distinguish between who gets deported and who stays
[5:23:59] Probulator: @NotASkiller cartels dont make money that way
[5:24:01] spike82q: "they care about ukraine borders but not our own "
[5:24:08] NutterCircus: We are dealing with people that believe empathy is a super power haHAA
[5:24:12] ATcaribou: @Vehicle_King that number should be close to 0, as we should make it much much harder to cross illegally anyways
[5:24:12] Bronloch: opposite of help LUL
[5:24:14] fviii: @arsenalenjoyer dude has been SCHIZO posting for a while
[5:24:22] rubbadubdubby: @arsenalenjoyer you think people just want to live in a terriblie state?
[5:24:31] CYBERDEMON6669: doesnt help that the democrats then use these illegals for their votes
[5:24:34] Zaziben: you turn someone away at the border, there's jothing stopping them from trying again later
[5:24:35] bots_bots: it was the republican SCOTUS that stopped the razor wier
[5:24:39] Vehicle_King: @Vehicle_King Then call your rep in Congress and tell them to enforce already existing legislation. NEITHER party does though. Ask yourself why.
[5:24:44] ATcaribou: the fact that there is a RECORD NUMBER of apprehensions isnt a point in favor of the federal governement, its a failure to secure in the first place
[5:24:49] Electroblazer: we had like 300K cross last month alone when we have states with like 600k people in them
[5:25:08] NutterCircus: SCOTUS IS NOT SUPPOSED TO BE POLITICAL.
[5:25:15] spike82q: 5 guys
[5:25:22] zen_oni_shinobi: @Vehicle_King reps don't enforce laws, law enforcement officers do.
[5:25:22] Metaphix: also the scotus is not beholden to any party no matter what you think
[5:25:22] arsenalenjoyer: The state has a right to act in its own self interest, especially if the federal government seems unable or unwilling to help
[5:25:25] bots_bots: 2 of which repub
[5:25:28] dustydollars2121: 4 women 1 pussy
[5:25:35] originmorii: @ATcaribou it means theyre actually catching more which literally means theyre securing the border.. are you retarded?
[5:25:35] rubbadubdubby: I feel like i'm talking politics with my gas store clerk @StaysafeTV
[5:25:36] sweatlordkush: BELIEVE ALL WOMEN
[5:25:37] SsxD_: does it matter?
[5:25:42] NotASkiller: this is too complicated. I think we just need to build a wall that makes the great wall of China look like a sidewalk
[5:25:48] Thurman__1: well citizens shouldn't be trying to enforce the border. the gov. should be doing it
[5:25:59] rubbadubdubby: you kinda just made it matter cuz you have dumb opinions
[5:26:00] ATcaribou: @originmorii a properly secured border would mean there are very very few people who make it into the country to get arrested
[5:26:08] arsenalenjoyer: yeah but the federal government isnt doing shit about it
[5:26:11] Bronloch: the border has been open for so long people actually think its not enforceable and cant be made airtight??? LUL WTF

[5:28:52] Garvickian: honestly building a wall is a meme dont they have sophisticated tunnels that run under the border
[5:28:54] 4wardsjack: @SsxD_ is hard work worth doing?
[5:29:00] zen_oni_shinobi: @Vehicle_King i think you misunderstand.  legislation exists on paper, which is passed through the house and senate to the president who can veto or approve. when a law that exists but is not enforced, it's up to each states governor to decide if they'll keep it and enforce it, amend it and enforce it or table it.
[5:29:02] dustydollars2121: ironically chicago is now complaining about the immigrants LOL

[5:29:25] Metaphix: no just a small ammount of their problems, and "sanctuary cities" cant even handle that much
[5:29:26] HitmandanTV: Texas is America

[5:29:30] CYBERDEMON6669: yall want the illegals? so whats the issue, you can have em
[5:29:32] Thurman__1: sounds like the logical thing to do. if the citizens don't belong in your state send them away
[5:29:34] SsxD_: @SsxD_ @4wardsjack yeah man ur right, a country founded on imigrants with no one ethnicity can close its borders easily

[5:29:56] HighWarlordofCHAZ: Stare
[5:29:56] bots_bots: but having razor wire at the border doesn't stop the people from crossing it makes them take more dangerous routes

[5:30:14] rubbadubdubby: no, i said business owners shouldnt be allowed to employ illegal immigrants
[5:30:16] Thurman__1: @rubbadubdubby were not talking about legal immigrants.
[5:30:18] Zaziben: im a different guy
[5:30:19] ATcaribou: even as somebody who is a staunchly in favor of a secure border, i actually hate how Abbott bussed immigrants all over the country. it was petty and dumb. He should have been working to deport them
[5:30:40] PazokiTV: sanctuary cities said they want to give them safe haven so Texas is just doing what those cities said they wanted? people are really mad Texas called their bluff? LUL
[5:30:56] Metaphix: @ATcaribou sanctuary cities said they welcome them

[5:32:03] SsxD_: if we doing that
[5:32:09] NutterCircus: Like I said, their empathy is seen as a super power.

[5:32:14] Thurman__1: I'm sure a lot of young people feel that way
[5:32:14] HighWarlordofCHAZ: @SsxD_ Then the system should be changed. They want it, then they pay for it.

[5:33:44] Arcsilin: @Vehicle_King i think its mostly the cartels but
[5:33:47] ProSounds: @Vehicle_King The US is not the main driver of instability in Central and South America. You are being lied to.

[5:35:00] arsenalenjoyer: imagine that
[5:35:02] Vehicle_King: @ProSounds Perhaps you are being lied to? Go look at the coups in South/Central America. Backed by US. Which leads to instability. All because a "socialist" got elected or was about to.
[5:35:02] Thurman__1: also not understanding human nature
[5:35:04] dustydollars2121: You dont have immigrant crime in oregon? i find that hard to believe

[5:39:35] kingpincognito: I live in rural E Texas, we have a ton of immigrants here. Legal and otherwise. Don't have an issue with either. Some of the guys I work with are here illegally and we're cool. For us here, it's the drugs coming in that gets linked directly to the cartels. Fentanyl, meth, and heroin busts happen monthly here.

[5:40:20] Thurman__1: maybe he had a rough upbringing
[5:40:21] snoopychair: aka daycare
[5:40:30] BinksMagnus: yeah, part of the definition of genocide is taking kids away from their cultural group with the intention of destroying the group

[5:41:11] bots_bots: @BinksMagnus it would have to only apply to a certain race/ethnic/religious group but ya
[5:41:33] Thurman__1: @rubbadubdubby why do you want to get banned so bad?
[5:41:51] BinksMagnus: @BinksMagnus wouldn't have to be specific to one group if the intent was to destroy cultural cohesion and promote the state

[5:51:33] teddymctedsterstv: I typically quit retail when it gets to "LF1M raid geared mythic 0 dungeon"
[5:51:47] saund: my parents got divorced when i was 2 when my mother got cancer and I ended up living with my uncle and aunt, my sister ended up living with another uncle and aunt, i can't imagine where i would have gone if the government would have placed me somewhere cause it was mandatory
[5:51:55] kingpincognito: Ah.
[5:52:13] kirk_hunts: They don't enforce it on youtube streamers
[5:52:15] Warriorfall: @thurman__1 I don't get what you mean, like you could level infinitely?
[5:52:20] kirk_hunts: for some reason

[5:52:52] teddymctedsterstv: TEST IT
[5:52:53] fviii: TRUEING
[5:52:54] Thurman__1: @Warriorfall well like in normal vanilla theres no level cap. so you can level to 60 unrestricted. when I said vanilla I was talking about SoD too

[5:53:40] kingpincognito: MadSeasonShow said today that you couldn't stream private on YT anymore. Thought it was a new thing.
[5:53:45] Thurman__1: I'm starting to think level caps aren't good in wow
[5:53:47] saund: @Bronloch I believe in Jesus Christ and he is my Lord, i don't believe in any argument that goes against his teachings
[5:53:49] AtomicHydraa: it’s pretty obvious when you are on private servers tho
[5:53:55] deathnntaxes: bro, you know what, i made a post on reddit about this. ive been doing gdkp's since SOD launched and never had a ninja. in the last 4 days ive had 9 NINJA gdkp leaders take all the gold and dip. seems like people are in the know about support staff quitting and getting away with murder
[5:54:06] teddymctedsterstv: Are you quest turning in to 28 on phase 2 launch?
[5:54:30] WhySoSandy: theres no way they pay people to hunt pserver streamers down

[5:56:59] harvenius: same for twitch lol
[5:57:06] deathnntaxes: all the gdkp runs i got that got ninjaed all 9 others in the raid said they reported, but i added most to F list and it says "char doesnt exist anymore" seems like they delete char or name change to get out of it
[5:57:09] Spankers: thats crazy
[5:57:14] Thurman__1: is that against tos?
[5:57:16] deathnntaxes: its def a new trned, because sod gold is worth so much money
[5:57:21] NutterCircus: Paying Customers.
[5:57:23] Xammy0: people are getting ideas now in the chat LUL
[5:57:42] saund: they'll probably add name changes in shop and also realm transfer eventually which will make it even easier ot get way with it
[5:57:46] Spankers: ofc thanks a lot bro
[5:57:47] dustydollars2121: Whats the medicine protocol tonihght?
[5:57:49] re5onxnce: change hairstyle you might get away
[5:57:51] Bronloch: @saund morals can certainly come from God and other places as well ... but a Christian doing bad things does not make them automatic non-Christians if you know what i mean? @thurman__1 that is exactly wrong there are devout Christians doing bad things every day
[5:57:56] Thurman__1: thats why gdkp's are kinda sketchy
[5:57:57] SnowbeltHero: does it specifically say anything about gdkps in the rules or is it just generic making a poor experience for other players
[5:57:57] YouDamnKids: yo have you seen all the bot rogues in SFK yet
[5:58:07] butterzugzug: 5 wins away @StaysafeTV
[5:58:10] AtomicHydraa: since day 1!
[5:58:15] Nightbot: NEW SOD VIDEO: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ir9uYRdcYuI&
[5:58:23] jdtopgun93: as someone who got tricked when wotlk gdkp someone walked away with the gold and since the gdkp isnt sanctioned by blizzard they arent resposible for what happens if they take them oney and run
[5:58:24] Thurman__1: @Bronloch well yeah Christians are still sinners.
[5:58:28] NutterCircus: They been doin that shit free gratis
[5:58:29] YouDamnKids: Bro i stand outside of there and just spam report them, ive gotten some mail from blizzard support saying they have been banned
[5:58:30] fiberi: gdkp has become so widespread blizzard should either implement it in the loot rules or just ban it altogether, not a fan
[5:58:30] Xammy0: I once lost 250k gold after gambling with a guy for a week and he finally logged out and never came back
[5:58:33] Spankers: The botting rogues have been here since week 2 LUL
[5:58:43] AtomicHydraa: RMT is a problem with almost every game

[5:58:54] Derezzed01: oh
[5:58:58] AtomicHydraa: at least there’s no aimbotters in wow lmao
[5:59:04] infom0rph: ive been ignoring bots in wow for 20 years
[5:59:07] YouDamnKids: they flyhack and go through the ground and open lockboxe
[5:59:07] verrack714: "the rogues"
[5:59:08] Thurman__1: fly hacking opening chests
[5:59:11] Spankers: they fly hack to chest locations and open it from above @StaysafeTV
[5:59:14] fviii: monkaW
[5:59:21] Bronloch: @saund correct and thus the "No True Scotsman" fallacy is a logic trap that most Christians fall into all the time and need to aware of avoiding
[5:59:39] Garvickian: NaM
[5:59:45] zen_oni_shinobi: @bronloch jesus said if you love me keep my commandments.  if a christian is a christian because he follows christ and obeys him faithfully he or she won't do bad things in the guise of a christian.
[5:59:46] Derezzed01: @Spankers huuuh
[5:59:50] ThyLordEzekiel: i remember the gold ads of the dead lvl 1 mages in stormwind lol
[5:59:53] BinksMagnus: power monkaHmm
[6:00:20] Thurman__1: @Bronloch its not a fallacy if the person isn't actually a Christian.
[6:00:32] Bronloch: @Zen_Practitioner that is the "No True Scotsman" fallacy
[6:00:32] fviii: there's a github for the program still
[6:00:39] Spankers: I played on a PServer once where hunters had a 0 haste bug on guns, and so you could shoot like a Mini-Uzi at everyone KEKW 1 shot Gmods
[6:01:04] Xammy0: lmao
[6:01:04] fviii: OMEGALUL
[6:01:08] bots_bots: sounds what mages had to do to deal with ignite munching
[6:01:13] AtomicHydraa: it’s the same as a cast bar tho cast bars show you latency so you can offset your casts
[6:01:24] AtomicHydraa: based on lag
[6:01:38] fviii: OMEGALUL fuck it
[6:01:50] Bronloch: @thurman__1 well yea if they arent a Christian then you can logically and accurately say that a Christian isnt doing that but there are TONS of Christian Karens and the simps who marry them that fight for open borders and all kinds of left wing policy
[6:01:57] EspressoAddict2020: holy GIGACHAD
[6:02:03] fviii: forsenCD
[6:02:08] QuestFor420: hahahahahaa
[6:02:09] Vehicle_King: EZ Clap
[6:02:15] saund: @Bronloch once you are born again and have the holy spirit within you, there is a higher realisation of right and wrong, Christian and non-Christian behavior, ignoring the labels but focusing on the actions only
[6:02:34] fviii: OMEGALUL
[6:02:36] Metaphix: probably because it was called shadowbolt LULW
[6:02:40] Thurman__1: @Bronloch well yeah those people themselves might be "lukewarm Christians"
[6:02:51] dustydollars2121: Where can this community have a "Rumble Friendly" conversation?
[6:02:51] EspressoAddict2020: like an A-10 Warthog PogU
[6:02:59] zen_oni_shinobi: @bronloch sorry bron, the Lord and Savior said if you love me keep my commandments.  it's not a statement for you to decipher and call a fallacy at will.  it is a law as immutable as the sky having clouds.
[6:03:09] Metaphix: KKona freedom fart
[6:03:18] Thurman__1: do you have nvidia? Try setting the Low Latency Mode to On or Ultra in the nvidia control panel. @StaysafeTV reduces input lag
[6:03:31] saund: @Zen_Practitioner amen
[6:03:47] Bronloch: @Zen_Practitioner so any Christian who killed or bore false witness or did some other sin is no longer a Christian? LUL
[6:03:53] Metaphix: LULW
[6:03:55] Creakydoors: pog face

[6:06:54] saund: let's say you decided to put a smaller but noticeable Mr Beast pog face in the corner of all your videos, could that be problematic in terms of copyright or is all fair and game in clickbait? @StaysafeTV
[6:06:55] Bronloch: GENIUS

[6:09:01] zen_oni_shinobi: machine gun wanding - little did they know private wow servers would set the layout for all combat in hogwarts legacy 10 years later. LOL
[6:09:02] Arcsilin: pally fucks so hard i need to make one

[6:11:04] Arcsilin: it is somthing to do in a mostly stagnant phase
[6:11:06] NutterCircus: I guess it is easier if you are getting paid to play wsg.
[6:11:07] zen_oni_shinobi: dude, during mop man.  i had master of wsg, i had EVERY wsg achivement possible except exalted outriders.
[6:11:17] majorbloodlol: 1k rep a week and wsg here and there when i feel down to do it is my plan
[6:11:35] majorbloodlol: uncertain if they will be bis with gnomer raid gear anyway
[6:11:38] Lionkingler1: cata classic it out by then
[6:11:47] saund: i think the only reason so many people are even debating on doing it is cause theres not much else to do before p2
[6:11:50] Thurman__1: I have 4k right now without touching wsg

[6:14:25] majorbloodlol: or dme

[6:14:33] Thurman__1: unless you're farming a lot
[6:14:43] WhySoSandy: why not form your own gdkp guild and farm the players?
[6:14:46] great_sun_of_life: that people who get gdkp gold from gold buyer buy
[6:14:56] great_sun_of_life: so its more like 500g per hour
[6:14:57] majorbloodlol: u dont need to farm raw gold that would be stupid
[6:14:59] WhySoSandy: maybe not guild but just raid
[6:15:07] deathnntaxes: its sso funny, you know wow economoy is a lot like real life, once wealth is built up its impossible to compete as a the new guy
