[0:32:24] GuimauveSovage: always
[0:32:24] Gizimoo86: yea or 50 % hp attackin mob

[0:33:32] Sheepyogirl: @Swifty going R14 this time around? PogChamp
[0:33:41] Cowardpatty: Hey John, good afternoon!
[0:33:53] ll3llo: theyre gonna keep releasing classics until shadowlands classic and then they'll start over with classic classic
[0:33:59] mcmagik124: I'm confused on how to feel about Classic right now, like future wise. With the current trend it's obvious Wrath will be coming in the future, but what happens when we have classic, TBC and wrath. Era is completely dead, this seasonal thing for classic seems to work, but at the sacrifice of a lot of dead TBC realms that Blizz won't merge
[0:34:12] ll3llo: it will be even more classic than classic
[0:34:30] Sheepyogirl: Gonna be so freaking cool to hit 60 and instantly equip full blue pvp gear
[0:34:41] jf1playertwitch: are you getting burnt out
[0:34:53] Ma_Ti: are you playing as ele? how do you find it @Swifty  any issues with mana?

[2:18:35] Enmael00: ST then
[2:18:36] SilkeySmooth: I did brd spam from 52 to 60
[2:18:59] spacialswareness: @Yoruus well when i see a toon 10 higher ilvls then me i expect them to do more dps then me let alone the tank
[2:19:13] EliBourne: That whole zone was a giant tank in the first classic
[2:19:15] Zicero47: Azshara is very nice
[2:19:17] thenightking06: hard brd 52-60
[2:19:18] EliBourne: Gank*
[2:19:39] Yoruus: @spacialswareness Ow you mean it that way... well that's just life, some players suck some don't :D

[2:20:31] moriartiphd: @spacialswareness nah, the last 10  ivls (240-250) don't more than 10-15% dps.  group composition will effect each one's dps more than gear
[2:20:33] spacialswareness: @Yoruus seems like most suck or i just play at the time when kids use daddys account
[2:20:45] Yoruus: @spacialswareness Suprisingly, good dps is not that easy to pull off in retail :)
[2:20:54] ChiefOfStPaul: Brd was a long time! Don’t miss that place!
[2:20:56] thenightking06: Arathi is the best and warsong True :D
[2:21:02] Enmael00: not good.. ally is leading the race
[2:21:04] moriartiphd: @spacialswareness but M+ is much more chill now.  ppl watching each others' dps is sort of tox
[2:21:14] mysst23: how you like SOM so far?
[2:22:11] spacialswareness: @moriartiphd lol i never said that i just said i assume  when someone has my i lvl or higher they should do aound my dps but they do less then the tank

[2:23:16] moriartiphd: @spacialswareness also depends on the tank.  like prot pallies will do 30-40% more dps if they spec for it.  but then they are trolling healers cause they get much softer
[2:23:19] KenleyShea: u forgot your food xD
[2:23:41] Yoruus: @spacialswareness I think you simplify it too much.Besides, I don't know what key you'r talking about. Cause M20, you defineteley have good dps :)
