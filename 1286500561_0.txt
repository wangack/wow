[1:19:10] at1c: classic is doing its job
[1:19:21] swordart_19: @Klavy you are just assuming and have 0 idea how many people are playing.
[1:19:23] Thunderbrew: Was thinking about coming back to WoW to level a couple of Characters to 60 before the next expansion

[2:25:10] KragnosWoW: i heard from koreans, scrappers are the most balanced class in lost ark and the game feels like it was made around that class

[2:28:22] dalaraz: you funnel progress mats through daily activities to other characters
[2:28:22] sinjordan: 2 dungeons daily?? lol what
[2:28:27] KragnosWoW: i think you get a free boost to level 50 once u reach level 50 so u should have atleast 1 alt for free
[2:28:36] Tyrou: 2 abyss dungeons you can loot from daily
[2:28:41] Tyrou: per character
[2:28:53] Tamb0rine: it costs gold to boost to 50
[2:28:55] jamarky23: @Roccocco Cool, good luck
[2:29:22] dalaraz: the daily activity reward requires 2 abyss,then its done
[2:29:23] thenormalbeast: In RU you could by extra runs, but I dont think this is in this version
[2:29:24] Holysal: 1 to 50 is 600g on KR but dont know if that will change
[2:29:26] Tyrou: it will cost gold to boost after the free one you get at your first lvl 50

[2:49:34] bypized: Nothing is coming out in March, they couldve won March
[2:49:37] Hawke_89: lol why others have to stick with it?
[2:49:49] Dankmanarmy: Cause they are bigger @Hawke_89
[2:49:53] 91Niki: Or April. April is literally dead when it comes to games
[2:49:54] kalamari__: would have looked bad to delay it even more. it already was supposed to come out in november
[2:49:55] bypized: @Hawke_89 cause they are bigger
[2:49:56] Aervyper: It's alright GW2 is just following the amazing path that New World blazed
[2:50:17] Hawke_89: lost ark iss bigger than Guild wars?? really?
[2:50:27] 91Niki: @kalamari__ Eh, gotta take the lesser of the two evils
[2:50:29] KragnosWoW: ive heard gw2 has some amazing mounts but i havent played guild wars since "guild wars: factions"
[2:50:34] cabalish: https://twitter.com/GuildWars2/status/1488919583935270916
[2:50:39] LSBreed: @colt_engineer feels more like a testing ground for stuff they are putting into 10.0, but also there too keep people occupied between then and 10.0
[2:50:39] metavahn231: lost ark is ffxiv levels of big
[2:50:43] Reckless666: @Aervyper gw2 is goin strong for 9years now.. while NW is already cucked lol
[2:50:51] metavahn231: big in korea and NA thats about it
[2:51:00] CanadianCataclysm: Has there been any info of 9.2 being released in feb?
[2:51:07] JeroenKijktMee: I'm sad EverQuest Next was canceled... Looked to forward too it
[2:51:15] luckfore: its coming march
[2:51:19] Ch0p_Su3y: is 9.2 release already dated or a guess?
[2:51:51] Thoreya: 9.2 is gonna come out feb 22 and people are gonna fliptf out when they announce it 2 weeks prior LUL
[2:51:51] dalaraz: copium
[2:52:01] lannytime: Do you think it's an ego thing with companies refusing to change release dates bases around other games
[2:52:04] sinjordan: @elixirfield1  lol lets not call Lost Ark = to FFXiV then say its only big in Korea and Na
[2:52:19] kalamari__: marketing is SO atrocius for that game. its unbelievable
[2:52:22] KragnosWoW: 2 weeks prior to the 22nd is the 8th which is lost ark early access LUL
[2:52:26] Sicknessqt: KEKW
[2:52:29] theSalute: LUL
[2:52:39] metavahn231: FFXIV is only big in na and japan lol, they so similar
[2:52:39] darksoreno: Conduit in 9.2 drop from M+ and upgrade wuth corency with drop from raid and m+ also
[2:52:52] Reckless666: tbh GW2 still better than current WoW KEKW
[2:53:00] KragnosWoW: Blizzard took a big ego hit recently
[2:53:09] Shongoshi: wow was launching games in middle of their own shit
[2:53:17] Grunton: poe delayed  a league when cyber punk was releasing lol
[2:53:19] zerkx1: As a longtime Guild Wars players (literally since beta) the game actually isn't going strong, it's been declining in revenue since it's launch. End of Dragons while it looks nice I suspect they're prepping for a GW3 or something
[2:53:19] DeanoTV: @Reckless666 ur opinion
[2:53:20] maka_tone: well... gw2 have massive and loyal community, but i agree they should know better
[2:53:23] Beet4: Guild Wars lol
[2:53:35] metavahn231: gw2 is so obscure now
[2:53:36] idenkaz_: also if LA proves itself here in the west it could open so many doors
[2:53:37] Reckless666: @DeanoTV well yeah i didnt said its yours Kappa
[2:53:39] Aethn: After Wildstar ... NCSoft should tread quietly everywhere it goes.
[2:53:44] benitezlalo: Still no 9.2 release date =(
[2:53:49] bypized: It's not a matter of being better at the moment, it's a matter of numbers. WoW still has a higher player population and train behind when something comes out
[2:54:02] JeroenKijktMee: You can say what you want... But the smooth engine of WoW is what a lot of MMORPG's miss. I liked GW2, but the engine sucks :P
[2:54:04] Fenundria: any plans on returning to SWTOR?
[2:54:07] Aervyper: @Towelliee wait a minute Blizzard had an EGO???? as of When? Was their ego around when the cosby show was on?
[2:54:10] Reckless666: i agree with u on that their marketing sux ass sadly
[2:54:22] maka_tone: i agree, they seems they are making xpac for current players and dont care about new coming in
[2:54:25] bypized: @Towelliee how is Lord of the Rings Online not dead?
[2:54:27] maka_tone: and actually wonder why

[2:54:36] Broomba: @towelliee -- which ice tea flavor do u like for gfuel other than nemesis ice tea?
[2:54:38] sinjordan: TBH i am a MMO person, and up until like a week or 2 ago i didnt even know about Lost Ark LUL
[2:54:38] craylon: yea ive never heard of guild wars myself lol
[2:54:59] JeroenKijktMee: @craylon Most fun are the Jump Puzzles haha
[2:55:02] NeoJon82: Lost Arkive has models of the different founders pack skins. https://lostarkive.com/model-viewer/
[2:55:04] kalamari__: @SaraivaBrr becuase of the LotR IP, same with swtor and star trek
[2:55:13] Murlocz: Isnt GW2 a popular game tho?
[2:55:16] Colt_Engineer: what
[2:55:18] kuwlord: KPOPheart
[2:55:18] Aervyper: Blizzard can't regain anything i literally can't find the launcher on my computer
[2:55:22] Colt_Engineer: how dare
[2:55:23] Dkgungo: yeah but the last 2 were amazing lol
[2:55:23] Aethn: Book of Mandalorian you mean
[2:55:24] bypized: Its true
[2:55:25] Colt_Engineer: you
[2:55:25] flushjay: true LUL
[2:55:26] CmeWIN: oh stop the 1st four were just fine
[2:55:28] zerkx1: they haven't cut the cord for GW2 yet because the person in charge of the product refuses to shut it down and has been fighting to keep the servers on for years
[2:55:33] bypized: Mandalorian Season 2.5
[2:55:39] metavahn231: people still know that GW2 has no dungeon support anymore and the raids are not balanced for the casual player, so they will never come back
[2:55:41] aimassistallen: Man, snow/ice storm and no internet. Gg 😭😭😭
[2:55:45] Dkgungo: its all one story its a mcu kinda thing
[2:55:48] PToastman: Boba isn’t even in it anymore
[2:55:52] idenkaz_: KEKW
[2:56:03] Fenundria: any plans on returning to SWTOR?
[2:56:07] Reckless666: @zerkx1 why would they cut the cord for gw2 lmao ?
[2:56:23] Murlocz: Isnt GW2 doing good tho? Lot of players F2P
[2:56:26] Shadowmental: gw still has a lot of players
[2:56:29] AmericanFat: its not even suppose to be a boba show, its season 3 of mandalorian, just with the origin story of Boba... nobody said there will ever be a Boba Fett season 2
[2:56:32] Reckless666: gw2 is top 5 mmos
[2:56:37] Reckless666: some ppl are just clueless lol
[2:56:41] Aethn: Guild Wars 2 still makes money, plenty of it, its going no where.
[2:56:58] Murlocz: @Reckless666 Pretty sure its top 3
[2:56:58] Ch0p_Su3y: as Grogu is consider a Mandalorian for Din and the creed.. the series The Mandalorian may be about him. Another Mando that also becomes a Jedi
[2:57:05] Ch0p_Su3y: who knows
[2:57:10] Reckless666: @jmendoza1310 playerbase ? KEKW
[2:57:14] Shadowmental: well name 1 game outsaide of wow that has long term duration, even LA will have a limited shelf life
[2:57:30] AmericanFat: @Ch0p_Su3y interesting...
[2:57:31] PToastman: I want grogu to get a little helmet
[2:57:33] Murlocz: @Shadowmental FFXIV
[2:57:43] metavahn231: lost ark will overshadow the little guys swtor/gw2
[2:57:45] kalamari__: I dont think they lack new players though. just read the comments udner bellulars latest video of GW2 (I know its representative) lots of new players or players that come back after 8-9 years
[2:57:51] AmericanFat: @Ch0p_Su3y i really hope Din Jarin or whatever he is called, will suddenly find out he has Jedi genes
[2:57:53] Shadowmental: @Murlocz your prob right, i never played that one
[2:57:58] Narmus_: Constant disconnects be a bitch
[2:57:58] Reckless666: what many ppl dont realise they judge the game by its twitch popularity.. yes gw2 is dead on twitch cuz of the bad marketing but if u go and play u will be amazed how many ppl are there
[2:58:02] kalamari__: (its NOT representative I mean!!!
[2:58:14] Reckless666: @jmendoza1310 okay wow fanboy KEKW
[2:58:29] AmericanFat: only ?
[2:58:38] tedol: that not that much
[2:58:40] Thoreya: LUL LUL
[2:58:41] luckfore: LUL
[2:58:42] metavahn231: games like gw2 are only alive because whales buying legendary skins
[2:58:47] sifer007: KEKW
[2:59:01] Ch0p_Su3y: @AmericanFat I hope not. But he may lead the mandos for a while wield the dark saber. Also u dont need to tap the Force to wield it, but connect with the blade. Many non-sensitive mandos have wielded before.
[2:59:04] luckfore: wow is still king lol
[2:59:20] Reckless666: @jmendoza1310 OMEGALUL
[2:59:21] Tamb0rine: and not a cent goes to marketing
[2:59:24] aimassistallen: Wow will literally never go anywhere

[3:00:23] tedol: bless you
[3:00:34] flushjay: salute
[3:00:37] zerkx1: I have a few developers of GW2 on my friends list in the game due to how old my account is and have even talked with a few higher ups. the product as it stands right now needs a large influx of players to come in EoD or it might face server closure
[3:01:09] kalamari__: @zerkx1 man, stop with your "facts"
[3:01:09] WrexalotStreams: i love you towelliee keep playing and streaming.
[3:01:37] tedol: that 50 million net income or total income?
[3:01:40] Ch0p_Su3y: @AmericanFat all Mandalorian creed, culture and training was to make them fight equally to the Jedi. Their tech is to surpress or even mitigate the Force use. Grapple hooks, jetpacks, beskar armor. Although swordsmanship may be something just a few master it. Maybe Grogu with a saber and Din with the darksaber can lead the mandos kind of together.
[3:01:40] Reckless666: 50mil from selling the expansions perhaps ?
[3:01:42] Reckless666: or total
[3:01:43] Aethn: GW2 probably makes $60-@80mil a year
[3:01:45] Mattsta: yeah, i was thinking 50mil sounds like a quarterly income amount
[3:01:52] Moobot: Ask a moderator for permission before posting a link, @jmendoza1310 (warning)
[3:01:54] kalamari__: gw2 makes 16-20 million per quater

[3:04:30] joontet: Yooooo
[3:04:31] kalamari__: very much. hes at mid game
[3:04:33] cabalish: towelliee needs tldr chat
[3:04:39] Murlocz: Did you checked bellular video of GW2? @Towelliee
[3:04:40] bypized: tbh at this point Bellullar knows that the drama of WoW not being good will catch the views
[3:04:55] bypized: The entire GW2 game is mid game I feel like
[3:04:59] kalamari__: yeah around 50
[3:05:01] Beefloaf: prob another long winded video with him and his buddy talking to no end
[3:05:11] Heero_Effect: @saraivabrr exactly he just wants to shit on stuffy
[3:05:13] Cabbageman007: Good too have ya back.  Sloot says your older than him
[3:05:31] AmericanFat: @SaraivaBrr Bellular just realised how much power his channel has... after his video about boosting went viral, blizzard did a massive TOS change, prohibiting illegal boosting in LFG chat
[3:05:41] dugarg_: you can do wpvp as well, forgot at which level
[3:05:42] Ch0p_Su3y: @Ch0p_Su3y yeap.. I don't do much.. but a few things can really break the emotion of seeing. It's hard to be surprised nowdays on how much stuff leaks out
[3:06:00] Treezi: what mg/brand do you vape towelliee? needing some new flavors and cant find a good brand.
[3:06:18] Wrizzik: @Towelliee I just turned 44. You speak the truth.
[3:06:19] jacnut: young pups
[3:06:23] kalamari__: his first 5-6 minutes of the video are a really fair assassment of the situation of gw2 currently
[3:06:42] Tzarvahl: im 30 and i already feel that way, almost drank an entire bottle of long island and about died. cant do it like i used to
[3:06:45] Thoreya: LUL LUL LUL

[3:07:00] 91Niki: @AmericanFat Usually we do a 1 week no spoiler rule with most shows and movies of that sort before we can full blown just chat about it. Just for future references :D
[3:07:08] luckfore: it was our lord and saviour phil spencer
[3:07:11] Hypertitan: oooo special slam
[3:07:12] bypized: @Towelliee the boosting movement I think it is because they are about to go Mobile, and that's where the Shop will actually shine gold bright
[3:07:16] dalaraz: aint it nice how things keep on happening after certain people left the company ? @Towelliee

[3:37:27] Tarren604: hell 50k is a lot for me :D, i have never bothered to farm gold or put in effort specificly to get it
[3:37:30] Sollice: Oh it is? I will have to look
[3:37:31] Tyrou: @lalelusa not sure how boosting in LA would work
[3:37:33] Kinghorn: podracer
[3:37:36] Semmspiral: Does the mount drop chance change in the patch? Or is it going to be like Jaina mount
[3:37:50] coldhandsbeatz: @dkgungo I guess you gotta play 20hrs a day lol it sounds like a huge amount to me
[3:37:52] Attackroot: i remember selling  the warbear mount in tbc, my guild made alot of money on that.
[3:37:59] Holysal: in KR there is its called Bussing
[3:37:59] dalaraz: where thers gaming,thers boosting :p
[3:38:17] Dkgungo: @coldhandsbeatz not really you just gotta know what you are doing

[3:38:22] frenzied_chicken: Hey Towlliee, what server for Lost Ark will you be playing on?
[3:38:27] lalelusa: @lalelusa yeah, me neither, that's why I'm asking. I know that you can boost your own alt for gold, but that's like any other character boost
[3:38:30] vadder_fister: well bro show it
[3:38:30] luckfore: are they done with raid testing?
[3:38:35] Semmspiral: I miss BFA freehold leveling. The easiest gold ever with a DH

[3:38:40] Volatilestyle: @coldhandsbeatz they have to buy the gold from blizz to afford the runs its just a big gold trading circle
[3:38:50] c0mmander_starscream: I dont think boosting it's viable in Lost Ark because of the mechanics
[3:38:59] HaxzorJimDuggan: i saw a video that said some people pay around 200g for a "bussing" but they make like 600g for getting the carry from the raid.
[3:38:59] Holysal: Asmgold is going Azena now
[3:39:00] KragnosWoW: i think asmon is changing to azena

[4:06:01] hooliggan: Paladin
[4:06:22] ThatsProto: i dont think necro prot will be dece
[4:06:29] ThatsProto: venthyr for raid
[4:06:38] ThatsProto: what about kyrian for other forms of content
[4:06:42] ThatsProto: probably still quite viable
[4:06:44] drunkpool2: Paladin is OP just so slow - Kyrian is best for them

[4:15:25] ARedBeard: its just ybarra and his guild testing
[4:15:28] misomander: i just hope its not another issue like SoD where you sit on your hands half the fight because of how fast you push bosses after double lego/4pc and you need specific timings
[4:15:35] Thoreya: very hyped for that algolon looking fight
[4:15:37] Naturalbeef: 9.2 release date today? No chance they announce it next week right??

[4:17:43] jmalmin: What is funny is that former wow players who has left for FF14. continue to read and bash everything blizzard does and continue to talk and go back to reading about wow.
[4:17:56] sunmx: rip darkee?
[4:17:57] Moobot: Who wins? https://strawpoll.com/cz3q7xfco

[4:18:52] Akoudadis: whats with the wow player? do you all singed an aggrement or something? didnt see shit when i logged in
[4:19:06] TheHexteria: I love playing wow but the fun drops off very fast, what do you do to stay motivated and hyped for WOW every day?
[4:19:12] swordart_19: @arkoudadis you will get one soon Kappa
[4:19:19] Angryfist40: yeah i havent played WoW for about 9 months but i expect to come back at some point :p
[4:19:20] Hypn0tical: They delayed a league because of Cyberpunk, but not because of Lost Ark an actual competitor LUL
[4:19:20] RaituTV: Kripparian
[4:19:30] swordart_19: @TheHexteria i play alts and do a lot of thing si am in mood.
[4:19:37] StarbuckTech: i played POE for like an hour or 2 and was like nope not my style of game lol
[4:19:38] deja_foo: I quit shadowlands. I might be back for another xpac. But we will see
[4:19:38] Holysal: theres 2 ppl that really will win. Exile or Darkee
[4:19:43] jmalmin: The new atlas tree does look interesting for sure.
[4:19:52] smygel: @towelliee when do you think grand theft auto 6 comes?
[4:19:53] Ohunter: Asmon had a pretty interesting hot take today. He was saying that blizz disabling addons like DMB and WA would improve blizz's ability to design dungeons and raids. What do you think about that idea?
[4:20:13] stjon13: after watching Arcane few weeks back I'm excited to see what LoL MMO will be like
[4:20:15] swordart_19: @Ohunter you dont need addons to beat any fights, actualy such addons makes you weaker.
[4:20:17] Bazsidiver: KEKW
[4:20:18] Justyy52: it would, addons and WA are doing things for you
[4:20:37] swordart_19: ALL ABILITIES are literally show in game by audio,visual clues already.
[4:20:49] 91Niki: I think GGG chose to not delay their league further, cuz it was already delayed as it is.
[4:20:51] Aethn: lol disable addons = massive subscription bleed
[4:20:52] StarbuckTech: ahh no more run away little girl lol
[4:20:58] Ohunter: @swordart_19 not saying you need the addons, but most players do use them
[4:21:10] Valestrus: are the bis convenats for each class somewhat well established now?
[4:21:14] swordart_19: @Ohunter their thing does not matter to me how others play
[4:21:26] swordart_19: Nothing
[4:21:38] Justyy52: it would just be harder
[4:21:42] gamor12: i think the raids are the good thinks about wow right now
[4:21:44] Hedrins: fights would just get boring
[4:22:13] smashwow: addons don't take away the quality of the boss mechanics. the quality is inherent to the boss
[4:22:15] swordart_19: You would turn on audio then and look at energy bars and such
[4:22:16] Cochese_: Never really used DBM during fights. Had it installed only to not be bothered by raid leader.
[4:22:28] Justyy52: imagine playing Mythic Ra-Den without WA
[4:22:36] Wcvechten: Probably more fights in the style FFXIV does it, where everything needs to be mega telegraphed
[4:22:41] Naturalbeef: Boosters would LOVE those add-ons removed
[4:22:44] swordart_19: @ShadyDax fix your interface then i play without them.
[4:22:50] 91Niki: Remember, GGG is not dependent on people playing their league from day one, their game is free to play. They depend on people buying their store items and supporter packs, which they know their dedicated players will, even if their players choose lost ark during their league launch
[4:23:13] CmeWIN: Back in my day , you would throw bodies at Trakanon till it died
[4:23:22] swordart_19: @ShadyDax literrally all mechanics are with visual, and audio cues play the game noob.
[4:23:26] belfastcl: one thing is analyzing an encounter on paper, another is how it plays out in practice, that second part partly depends on addons and other things
[4:23:32] M2thew: i hate telegraph system, looks so weird to me
[4:23:40] swordart_19: I bet most of you play without sound and dont hera half of things :P
[4:23:45] Heero_Effect: Is WoW still your favorite?
[4:23:49] Nephilim_Glass: lol...ofc it does...
[4:23:50] swordart_19: Nope 0 thing does
[4:23:58] swordart_19: Go play without addons and you are good
[4:24:01] Justyy52: on the other hand it takes out those amazing people working on WA
[4:24:02] camarac: people use addons because they're available, but they would still get the fights done without them
[4:24:14] swordart_19: It is just diffferent thing showing same thing
[4:24:19] bowsers1: addons are overrated , they don't make a player good
[4:24:22] Clicklesly: Yeah, tbh DBM and WAs mostly help when you're learning the encounter ^^
[4:24:38] Bazsidiver: i need weakauras for my rotation not just boss mechanics...
[4:24:39] Clicklesly: After that it's pretty much whatever
[4:25:01] CDubTheRIPper: LUL
[4:25:04] SpoofAvatar: "move bitch get out of the way'

[4:26:54] Valestrus: @Towelliee out of curiosity I have the graphics of WoW at 10/10 the game seems to run fine with those graphics settings buuuut yours seems to still look better than mine. I guess is a problem with my PC set-up, even though the game runs perfectly fine in the highest settings?
[4:26:55] 91Niki: God kids... stop arguing in chat
[4:27:02] Naturalbeef: Zach gets carried anyway so of course he thinks DBM/WA can be removed

[4:28:31] Wcvechten: Yeah, I think that removing the addons, he thinks those mechancis get removed/reduced significantly
[4:28:34] bowsers1: i mean Asmongold thinks M+ have too much things going on so
[4:28:39] GodKingMuninn: If the communitty can't carry him in the content he doesn't want it.
[4:28:41] lovemymage: he wants fight to be easier
[4:28:42] dracullus: he always move goal post when Blizzard is crazy enough to listen him

[5:03:40] S1appadabass: @Towelliee bro, i have toons that have lived in Mechagon since Covid started trying to get that damn Harvester mount
[5:03:48] dalaraz: lot of improvements are made af ter a certain guy left blizz,have faith more are coming :p
[5:04:48] vintersorgSA: i never once got the rusty wheel or spider :/ i got the goddamn golden wheel in the 3 months it took!
[5:04:57] vintersorgSA: drop rate so abysmmal
[5:05:02] luckfore: or they posted it under his name :\
[5:05:14] Buckwink: im starting to get really excited for 10.0
[5:05:27] vintersorgSA: xfaction rules, a good direction
[5:05:29] Short_Film: surprised they didnt wait til 10.0 to release that
[5:05:35] xHukk: LUL
[5:05:42] pannkakewow: you gnome bastard LUL
[5:05:44] Semmspiral: Its great, I get to play with my alliance friends. I also don't feel bad about changing some characters to alliance
[5:05:45] daddycrazy1: 9.2.5 December 2022 TrollDespaire
[5:05:46] smashwow: lol inb i really wish you were on EU instead of NA Kappa
[5:05:46] Shamwise: "Lil Gnome Bastard"- Towelliee 2022
[5:05:48] Alegnowar: i tought they would have saved it for 10.0 feature bot maybe they wanna test it a lot first
[5:05:54] luckfore: i dont wanna see no ugly cows running around in stormwind
[5:05:54] vintersorgSA: yeah, 9.2.5 will be the test and the new xpac there will be some big quest to combine
[5:06:09] Eggz1004: next time 100%
[5:06:11] dalaraz: 9.2.5 is the alpha,10.0 bets is the beta and release of 10.0 is actual cross fanction
[5:06:16] vintersorgSA: hehe, it'll be like Everquest and KOS for other cities
[5:06:18] S1appadabass: i will be returning to Horde the second that drops
[5:06:21] Sollice: @towelliee oh you didn’t hear?  Gnomes are excluded from cross faction activists on the account of them being disgusting little shits
[5:06:24] Wcvechten: I just think faction capitals and such should still remain faction specific
[5:06:27] Kisswani: did you see that the last chapter of the 9.2 story was removed from PTR ? wonder what that's about
[5:06:45] vintersorgSA: nice bat
[5:06:51] BBWilly: Is there a date for 9.2 yet?
[5:06:57] Sollice: @kisswani maybe moving it to 9.2.5 for some story content
[5:07:00] Wraith_33: “Meet me in dal”
[5:07:11] Alegnowar: argus stuff
[5:07:16] vintersorgSA: if xfaction comes to be real i may come back to WoW but damn, not looking forward to it haha
[5:07:20] dalaraz: ptr shouldnt exist to begin with anymore
[5:07:29] CyonDru: @felmister then dont come back??
[5:07:41] vintersorgSA: the addiction!
[5:07:43] smashwow: if they want to do and epilog style .5 that's cool.
[5:07:59] hooliggan: Horde and Alliance will remain enemies till they enter the instance
[5:07:59] Kisswani: @Sollice yeah , maybe , would love to have it in 9.2 to tbh . kinda want to be done with SL story and pave the way to 10.0 in 9.2.5
[5:08:00] raiwist: that'd be funny
[5:08:04] Hawke_89: LOL i already faction changed to alliance
[5:08:07] Quackthyr: alliance = azralon
[5:08:10] Aro725: i love the cross faction. I always loved being alliance but just had no one to play with
[5:08:13] Wcvechten: Dwarves and Nelfs probably get accepted if anything
[5:08:13] reggiepowa: alliance make their own group and invite horde
[5:08:17] Alegnowar: just wait for Echo and liquid players to go alliance and the toxic swarm will follow LUL
[5:08:26] craylon: i hate allys id inv just to kick
[5:08:30] swordart_19: Yep not playing with alliance filth
[5:08:31] GodKingMuninn: wait until the leaderboard is flooded with alliance players xD
[5:08:35] Bayne77: hey, you can now take your little brother with you!  why would i want to do that?
[5:08:37] swordart_19: KEKW
[5:08:42] Screamnsteam: im just waiting for a liquid merch drop EZ
[5:08:52] MrTurkeyy: They wont due to racials
[5:09:00] Kisswani: now watch Blizzard introduce faction locked classes just to fuck with people Kappa
[5:09:08] Sollice: Night Eld DH=Best DH do that makes me happy I could be one and raid with Lula
[5:09:09] Syprus1: the best mythic+ rogue in the world is a dwarf Ramfam
[5:09:09] misomander: blue/white
[5:09:12] vintersorgSA: lol @Kisswani
[5:09:18] Aro725: @MrTurkeyy why ? ally racials are way better
[5:09:24] dalaraz: liquid could go alliance for their reason,why would a standalone player do that though
[5:09:33] dalaraz: pay 25$ to change a single char
[5:09:35] Scoodles91: well those two guilds are so known that whenever they need replacements ppl will just faction swap to play in them
[5:09:40] swordart_19: @dalaraz race look
[5:09:43] raiwist: that's a lot of tokens
[5:09:46] Reio_O: So..GTA 6 is underway
[5:09:48] sunmx: at this point everyone one liquid have 8 buckets
[5:09:49] ArroArroArro: Cross faction guilds 10.0 , so no need to have everyone change
[5:09:50] Hypertitan: II remember max saying the ability to buy boe's on alliance was horrible and that was part of the reason they didn't go alliance...I wonder how that's going to change with xfaction
[5:09:51] reggiepowa: blizzard said they would add cheaper options for mass transfers
[5:09:54] Sollice: If Alliance Racials were better RTWF guilds would be alliance so that’s not true
[5:10:03] Sollice: In terms of combat anyways
[5:10:04] misomander: is day 1 cross faction mythic going to work on same realm? it be interesting to see like 16 horde/4 alliance on a roster for RWF
[5:10:06] dalaraz: nto worth with that cost imo @swordart_19
[5:10:07] NA_Mus: I thought the limit contract ended recently though
[5:10:15] luckfore: u would have to faction change to on ur liquid pally
[5:10:17] Theduskflyer: i thin RWF has elements of Pay to win
[5:10:35] PokerFaceMoose: i thought you youtube video on the RWF being pay to win was really really good
[5:10:42] Aro725: @Sollice theyve all said they are better lol. they dont switch cause everyones horde. literally the only reason. Why go alliance when 90 percent of the top playerbase is ally
[5:10:49] Alegnowar: AH is cross faction anyway no?
[5:10:57] Aro725: is horde*
[5:11:15] kpee_: I was looking at the Lost Ark chest options... does the game have a pay to win aspect?

[5:11:18] swordart_19: @alegnowar yes
[5:11:27] Hypertitan: if enough people go alliance I think they will...Maybe make AH xfaction also?? who knows
[5:11:32] swordart_19: @kpee_ don't think
[5:11:37] Sollice: That’s not a combat reason that’s a reason for needing people to get boe gear feed
[5:11:39] PokerFaceMoose: there is no regulation and no overarching org that can make it competative
[5:11:44] swordart_19: @hypertitan no reason
[5:11:55] Kisswani: but you can't really grow RWF as an event without the involvement of these orgs
[5:11:58] Holysal: @kpee_ its the same as WoW
[5:12:09] Aro725: isnt the AH already cross faction?
[5:12:13] dalaraz: @Alegnowar @the booty bay ah is crossfaction,main city ah aint
[5:12:17] kpee_: @kpee_ wow doesn't sell potions and such
[5:12:23] swordart_19: @aro725 it is
[5:12:34] hi_jester: wow pay to win confirmed
[5:12:57] Naturalbeef: What is that XX amount?
[5:12:59] dalaraz: @Alegnowar only goblin ah is crossfaction,main city ones aint
[5:13:16] Wcvechten: imagine if Method buys Echo Kappa
[5:13:21] GivTater: looking for guild to pay me to farm mats for them
[5:13:24] Kisswani: if other orgs get involved , maybe ?
[5:13:29] seanb4games: I mean, you can argue that about any major sport then. Football is P2W
[5:13:31] Theduskflyer: RWF has Pay to win Elements, 100% you still need good players right. but you can buy them
[5:13:33] Alienfromger: sports in gerneral is the same way

[5:14:06] swordart_19: @amchooka sounds good
[5:14:09] dalaraz: @Alegnowar as i just googled,im wrong btw,they are crossfaction after patch 6.0
[5:14:12] DecayedmiNt: I'd rather Method continue with what they're doing. They can make it a 3 guild race
[5:14:23] Kisswani: KEKW

[5:14:28] Kisswani: what an analogy
[5:14:36] swordart_19: KEKW
[5:14:51] smashwow: @saltyseal17 that was always the running joke with NY Yankees. especially in early days.
[5:15:18] Sollice: I dunno. I don’t feel like “hiring” players isnt pay to win. I think this is what the game has been for a few expansions. RWF is big business for people
[5:15:24] swordart_19: Team play Kappa
[5:15:26] LokktarrOgarr: Does the NFL have a salary cap?
[5:15:28] trivotix: Cowboys....

[5:16:12] Hypertitan: I 'member the last time they won a SB :(....rough day s being a cowboys fan for the last 20+ years
[5:16:13] dimofodi: The Cowboys only have 1 playoff win in like the last 20 years let alone a SuperBowl.
[5:16:19] kolmgorov: money bal wow

[5:16:40] swordart_19: @heftyunit_ Warcraft universe not directly wow
[5:16:45] reggiepowa: more like world 3rd race

[5:17:19] raiwist: maybe they need divisions for this stuff; like pro, semi-pro, etc.
[5:17:19] Sollice: The idea that teams can’t afford players is a stupid one. This is what the NFL NBA MLB have been for years. If your team can not compete with the Yankees in terms of salary then money all it or sell
[5:17:31] sunmx: i got that mount on LFR thats where the big odds are.

[5:18:43] Kisswani: imagine quitting your job to join Liquid , only to be cut after 1 tier
[5:18:47] bawheid: the race to world first is now so far removed from the majority of player experience that its utterly irrelevant
[5:19:07] reggiepowa: good enough for world 3rd maybe
[5:19:11] swordart_19: @bawheid lol Nope
[5:19:19] dalaraz: @bawheid why ?
[5:19:31] theDirtyon3: you get some of liquid and echos players that are not playing as much
[5:19:35] posiedensgrace97: posiedensgrace97 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 5 months, currently on a 5 month streak! 
[5:19:38] Theduskflyer: Method said they werent going for 1st. just top 10. and got 5th both races @Towelliee
[5:19:41] Screamnsteam: kind of impressed how Method bounced back, i thought they were done for
[5:19:44] Buckwink: Method was stuck on painsmith for sooooo long
[5:20:01] dalaraz: top 5 for a fresh team is impressive tbh

[5:21:08] Holysal: @swordart_19 they wont being so far behind but that would be crazy and funny. the world would burn
[5:21:08] ILikeKillTheZombies: they should fix the legacy mode in 9.2.5
[5:21:14] Screamnsteam: @Holysal ya but a top 10 guild compared to the top 2 is night and day
[5:21:25] swordart_19: @kisswani I would want to watch some neutral who cast them all

[5:22:07] reggiepowa: chinese guilds are like 3 days behind

[5:22:12] Sollice: We don’t need a title patch for legacy turning. That’s a hot fix they can deploy
[5:22:14] dalaraz: even if all top 7 gone to last 3 bosses together,the gap is huge
[5:22:16] Tonberrius: If Halondrus is any indicator they probably will be KEKW
[5:22:18] sinlesssinner: how does Echo do it ffs :) just shows you how super good they are. They always start 24hrs behind liquid haha
[5:22:31] swordart_19: More guilds at same boss more hyrp
[5:22:35] swordart_19: *hype
[5:22:55] Buckwink: it would be way more fun to see 3 or 4 guilds all on the last boss
[5:22:57] Hypertitan: i love the wfr...i just wish they would do a worldwide release so I didn't have all that crap spam the whole time
[5:22:58] sinlesssinner: at the same time? i think Echo wins everytime
[5:23:01] dalaraz: bring the chinese in then you have a proper arce :p
[5:23:10] Sollice: @sinlesssinner they get some of the initial bugs dealt with before they start and they see strats
[5:23:16] bawheid: @sollice do you honestly enjoy watching wow raids, RWF or otherwise? raiding in wow is great fun, watching wow raid streams/vids is dull as ditch water
[5:23:27] Kisswani: I just hope it would be as exciting as Sanctum was . the raid itself might not be up there , but man it was so close at the end
[5:23:35] dalaraz: @bawheid i actually enjoy watching it tbh,
[5:23:58] Sollice: @bawheid Yes I do as well as several hundred thousand people. RWF is an Indians community event
[5:24:00] sinlesssinner: @Sollice well they somehow get ahead too, on bosses they havent seen on streams :)
[5:24:03] pigzip: Should rename it to something like the race to world 3rd
[5:24:04] swordart_19: SECRET DISCORD POGGERS
[5:24:06] Alexkayzz: In b4 "Joe who worked on legacy quit his job"
[5:24:09] Rulem: @sinlesssinner its not 24 hours, I think its 16.  Also, they literally do not need to waste any time with the first 6-7 bosses at all since they can just use the NA kill vids to make their strat
[5:24:13] GodKingMuninn: They changed their philosphy that you should be able to realistically solo stuff once its 2 expansions old.
[5:24:15] dalaraz: im still waiting for global raid release and week reset so people calm down
[5:24:15] Lexi__Marie: watch them not tell you
[5:24:27] kpee_: did you hear anything 9.2 release date in that secrete discrod of yours?

[5:25:01] Sollice: @sinlesssinner I’m not saying they aren’t better once things get equal. I’m just staying there are some advantages to having things done before you
[5:25:11] dalaraz: @Tausgi oh he got the patch release ? :p
[5:25:20] bawheid: @sollice so a minority of wow players enjoy watching raid streams.
[5:25:28] Sollice: I think everyone would love world wide release so this is never a talking point
[5:25:31] sinlesssinner: @Sollice for sure buddy we agree

[5:29:48] griffdog125: lol you see asmond's video calling everyone out about the wow mobile game telling them all you were right lol
[5:29:50] bawheid: @sollice you are free to care as you will, but it dosent make RWF relevant to the majority of wow players
[5:30:01] Gekiretsu: @towelliee who do you got, Rams or Bengals
[5:30:12] Rulem: yeah, the classes feel very unique to play and I found I don't like some classes I normally enjoy
[5:30:14] Alllprimer: Alllprimer subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 58 months! 
[5:30:16] lalelusa: @dalaraz I was thinking about that one, too. super excited to give it a go
[5:30:19] swordart_19: @bawheid weirdo such nonsense can be said on everything
[5:30:45] dalaraz: @lalelusa yeah if oyu like fast paced games,wardancer looks dope
[5:30:55] bawheid: @swordart_19 nice retort

[5:31:54] swordart_19: Dragons POGGERS
[5:31:58] Putcride: I think the leakers have a fetish with dragons
[5:32:00] Kisswani: Dragons + Old gods Kreygasm
[5:32:04] lalelusa: @dalaraz I'm curious how it will feel. I've watched some vids, but that's not the same as playing and getting a feel for it myself, I guess. the spell animations look amazing with every class
[5:32:04] Chucklezz01: Burrow is a gift from God as far as the Bengals are concerned. He was fun to watch when he was playing for LSU
[5:32:05] zerkx1: I bet the next expansion is not dragons but instead something like the Emerald Dream
[5:32:07] CodyKane: @Lothlorienbgd Lost Ark
[5:32:09] swordart_19: @bawheid no need to say more bye .

[5:32:56] jeffnsteff2019: and he has no fear
[5:33:02] 3putting: should have seen them at LSU together
[5:33:03] Gekiretsu: they already broke a ton
[5:33:05] wEiRdO_dUdE: Joe Burrow could be one of the greats, if he keeps learning and improving and avoids injury
[5:33:08] Short_Film: Bengals need to get him a O line
[5:33:18] Kakotan2143: nelianLol nelianLol
[5:33:35] frequency_shade: just watch asmongold and you where right wow mobile is confirmed
[5:33:36] CodyKane: I mean coming back from a terrible knee injury, and then lead them to the super bowl has gotta say something about his character
[5:33:39] Taco117: LSU Joe and Chase were something
[5:34:18] CDubTheRIPper: that is crazy

[5:34:19] Spoonzzy: this is the one
[5:34:21] 3putting: and do it in 3 years lol
[5:34:41] TheGiant99: Gotta hope he doesnt get sacked 9 times like he did vs the Titans
[5:34:55] wEiRdO_dUdE: Those Cincinatti Bengals fans went through hell with so many years of their teams screwing up, it's great for them to be in the big game
[5:34:56] CodyKane: I honestly think the Bengals are a dark horse, but i believe its Staffords year to win
[5:35:01] Screamnsteam: Aaron donald wants that ring
[5:35:01] Buckwink: Bengals gotta run the ball
[5:35:13] mobey_taguire__: But they are playing for Harambe!
[5:35:13] NinjaGlovz: KEKW KEKW KEKW
[5:35:25] CDubTheRIPper: its a great super bowl tbh, both teams have good stories going into it and are pretty likeable
[5:35:26] papaherc: whatever defense plays the best wins the super bowl
[5:35:27] mavericks312: the one thing ppl aren't talking about is how well the Bengals defense has played these playoffs
[5:35:29] iccyc0ld: so there about to be a ton of in game purchases now?
[5:35:34] ZHSpar1an: News of wow mobile, days ago POGGERS

[5:35:38] Blah206: Is that what Tom Chilton has been working on?
[5:35:38] Sollice: @gekiretsu Athens isn’t a bad town to start off with. It’s not like it’s Detroit lol
[5:35:44] Shongoshi: I was waiting for wow mobile since MoP beacause I think I saw swifty play wow on some gaming phone :D
[5:35:47] lalelusa: hopefully, it's not just  a mission table/brawler type app.

[5:36:31] Eggz1004: i kinda hope it deals with pet battles so I can lvl pets without actually being in game
[5:36:31] jeffnsteff2019: tom brady for MVP of normal season play including fact he almost handed rams their ass in that playoff game
[5:36:35] zeitgeiz: He knows
[5:36:37] TheGiant99: Are you guys surprised Shroud isnt playing Lost Ark
[5:36:41] Kisswani: sloot and lore were hilarious yesterday KEKW

[5:38:22] CDubTheRIPper: D:
[5:38:25] c0mmander_starscream: lol
[5:38:30] Sollice: I would rather he doesn’t play if he isn’t in to it. Bad look for him Twitch and the game
[5:38:33] CDubTheRIPper: dcwFeels
[5:38:39] lalelusa: he's got the legs for it^^
[5:38:41] 91Niki: @Dcarter sacWAVE

[5:39:06] Shalestorm: Morning friends :)
[5:39:20] swordart_19: @shalestorm towHi
[5:39:34] TheGiant99: I wonder how much Modz will play with the baby
[5:39:56] Sollice: Think I am going Bezerker
[5:39:58] seemfonee: Is Saint one in the event too?
[5:39:58] ClipCraft: ok if this pull aint it idk what it
[5:40:11] TheGiant99: No saint helped create it
[5:40:16] yokai_5: also grimzz and scariel these 2 when they play a game together they destroy the contents .
[5:40:23] seemfonee: oo
[5:40:37] TheGiant99: @Sollice madness zerker is a shit ton of fun
[5:41:07] Sollice: In the beta I tried a ton of classes but zerker is the one I kept wanting to try to level with
[5:41:13] TheGiant99: once you get it up amd running
[5:41:17] 91Niki: I'm gonna play Martial Artists, either Striker or Wardancer, once it comes out on the 11th

[5:42:31] jeffnsteff2019: did u hear playstation has discord now
[5:42:37] c0mmander_starscream: #FuckthatServer
[5:42:50] NoobyNoSkills: its just an integration
[5:42:53] Jango_: they purchased it awhile ago
[5:42:54] bromens: I keep getting notices about the ps network / discord linking
[5:42:54] 91Niki: No they partnered with them
[5:43:03] GivTater: I was here!
[5:43:05] Sollice: Sony does not own Discord
[5:43:06] Jango_: or partnered
[5:43:08] GivTater: no I wasn't.
[5:43:16] IzuMeister: its rigged!
[5:43:22] TipsyT90: What game was you guys talking about earlier it sounded like a new release
[5:43:23] luckfore: 1 of your chars prob has it in his bags
[5:43:26] swordart_19: F
[5:43:29] Sollice: That’s only so people can see what games you are playing on ps on discord
[5:43:34] sunmx: u can run multiple times on ToS each week right?
[5:43:53] jeffnsteff2019: wasnt sony going to do a serive like xbox has for it players
[5:44:00] jeffnsteff2019: service
[5:44:03] 91Niki: @Sollice Yeah so far, they are working to integrate it more with Playstation.
[5:44:07] Sollice: Sony owning Discord doesn’t make a lot of sense to me
[5:44:13] Nehcrom: @Towelliee So with MicroSoft buying acti-blizz and amazon games having their own studio AND streaming platform. What do you see as MicroSofts alternative streaming platform (besides mixer lol)?
[5:44:17] Jango_: 10 billion left to spend
[5:44:18] mavericks312: I could see Sony buying Rockstar as well
[5:44:22] TipsyT90: Sony better make some BIG moves because Microsoft is buying up everything to monopolize the gaming industry and sell games under their pass for 9.99 others wont be able to compete with the prices
[5:44:28] 91Niki: Yeah Sony being purely console, doesn't make sense that Discord would sell to them
[5:44:35] Sollice: @nah more than that. They just bought zings for 7 million
[5:44:45] Sollice: Stupid mobile
[5:44:49] ILikeKillTheZombies: well we will have news about next gta this year
[5:44:55] ILikeKillTheZombies: so someone might want to buy them
[5:44:58] yokai_5: rockstare can buy sony with 5% of their gta5 income LUL
[5:44:58] Sollice: Yes
[5:44:59] Nehcrom: @Sollice Suuure ;)
[5:45:03] yokai_5: rockstar*
[5:45:09] Sollice: Sony doesn’t have the money to buy studios that big
[5:45:10] mavericks312: @tipsyt90 yea problem is for MS can't sneeze the wrong g way or the ftc will be all over them atm
[5:45:21] Darwoo: what lights are those in the bg @Towelliee
[5:45:31] c0mmander_starscream: The next GTA will be released across all the platforms.
[5:45:32] TipsyT90: @mavericks312 That is true
[5:45:43] Sollice: @towelliee that’s not a correct number. They bought Zynga for 7 billion
[5:45:44] c0mmander_starscream: Sony can't act like its 2003 anymore
[5:46:01] mavericks312: sony has bonds and other means to afford another company they were saying
[5:46:03] Jango_: Nintendo will just watch sony and microsoft buy everything and shrug
[5:46:03] swordart_19: Overpaid for bungie
[5:46:15] Mr_O: sony added another 2 bill to keep the developers from leaving
[5:46:23] Nehcrom: @swordart_19 I disagree.
[5:46:33] Jango_: If i had to bet sony buys Sqaure-Enix
[5:46:34] thomasdc127: Hope you all have a nice weekend!
[5:46:36] CritzBTW: feels like back in the day when people picked dodgeball teams
[5:46:48] mavericks312: @swordart_19 Sony is gonna make Bank once they start making destiny movies and shows
[5:46:48] Jango_: Square-Enix*
[5:46:54] swordart_19: @nehcrom they make 1 game and don't feel Destiny2 being hot bakery
[5:46:58] Soproatlol: disney is gonna buy something big
[5:47:06] NVbrutal: square enix is already making playstation exclusives, they dont need to buy them lol
[5:47:11] swordart_19: @mavericks312 I think they bought them to make pc ports
[5:47:18] NVbrutal: would be a waste of money to do what they are already doing.
[5:47:23] dracullus: oh God, WoW vs FF will become Microsoft vs Sony
[5:47:23] Jango_: @NVbrutal  they do that because sony pays them to
[5:47:23] Nehcrom: @swordart_19 There are several aspects that the y take into doing acquisitions.
[5:47:28] StormiiG: Kingdom Hearts mmo inc???
[5:47:32] mavericks312: also alot of Squares games are huge in Japan etc were Sony runs the land
[5:47:50] GivTater: I think Nintendo is the only one of the big three that needs to get with the time and stop going backward. the switch is nice but they need to look at making their console stronger not mobile and put things on PC.
[5:47:51] Moobot: Towelliee booted up his YouTube channel again! Check out the latest YouTube video HERE || Race to World First is Pay-To-Win!? - World of Warcraft 9.2! youtu.be/x6Z62JM09XQ
[5:47:53] Short_Film: I want a new Star Fox game
[5:47:54] xALcaPWNedx: Need more donkey Kong
[5:47:56] billybaroo1: what about the sims? Kappa
[5:47:56] swordart_19: @nehcrom I take what I see bungie looks lame and next expansion is joke
[5:48:01] beerbellygaming: i would love for nintendo to buy rare from microsoft
[5:48:15] Nehcrom: @swordart_19 Do your research then?
[5:48:18] ILikeKillTheZombies: nintendo fans buy every pokemon game even if its really bad
[5:48:18] Waspire: basically nintendo gave up on the gaming market and only does crap games.
[5:48:19] Jango_: 5th best selling console of all time
[5:48:20] ILikeKillTheZombies: :D
[5:48:25] uawildcat04: @Towelliee im ready for a boys night on LA release. Break yoour dry spell
[5:48:34] 91Niki: Everyone wants a MMO RPG styled Pokémon game, but Nintendo is literally just like "Don't tell us what to do" LUL
[5:48:35] swordart_19: @nehcrom what for did already over paid
[5:48:40] mavericks312: @swordart_19 your only thinking of games though, this deal is to help Sony with live service and Sony helping bungie to makes destiny movies and shows
[5:48:54] GivTater: it's the mobility. it makes it nice. but the power and graphics are lacking. most of the big game ports are cloud versions because the switch can't handle it.
[5:48:58] dracullus: Sony buys SE, switch name to Arasaka, corpo wars begins
[5:48:58] Nehcrom: @swordart_19 That goes for everything in the stock market so what is your point besides the obvious? ;)
[5:49:06] mcbojangles: Next thing microsoft will buy is supercell and take over mobile games allso
[5:49:07] griffdog125: contra was my jam
[5:49:18] NVbrutal: with the money nintendo has made off there systems you would think they could make a console that gets over 30 fps
[5:49:30] 91Niki: @NVbrutal  One would think right LUL
[5:49:33] swordart_19: @mavericks312 when these clowsn will actually make something then maybe so far I base judgement on what exist
[5:49:41] Sollice: @mavericks312 I would be more excited about Bungies new IP than anything. Destiny as a TV show could be great but that’s hundreds of millions they would need to drop for that to be a good show
[5:49:41] Naturalbeef: I remember when Donkey Kong first came out. It was incredible
[5:49:46] Lifestream7: @91Niki Im surprise they dont do it only because the money they could make off like Pokeball Skins / Pokemon  Costumes etc...
[5:49:46] mavericks312: switch was outdated graphically when it released technically
[5:49:58] NVbrutal: half the time they barely get 20 tho lol heard the new pokemon game is rough at times
[5:49:58] Nehcrom: Now here is truth.
[5:49:59] mandalakoala: haven't actually played shadowlands since launch, worth picking back up again?
[5:50:01] DwarfWarrior25: yo dude how was vegas
[5:50:02] shimwood: Imagine caring about graphics on a Nintendo console LuL
[5:50:09] abracka_: i mean the switch is the highest sold console, i don't think people really care all that much about the fps on it
[5:50:13] Nick_Vs_Games: nintendo doesnt compete with sony and microsoft.. they have their little corner of the market and are happy with it
[5:50:16] MattJ063: Nintendo already in bed with Microsoft though.  The Dying Light 2 on Switch will be streamed on Xbox streaming services
[5:50:17] GivTater: i think that model will start hurting them in the coming years.
[5:50:26] DwarfWarrior25: ahhh my bad sorry dude =)
[5:50:27] GodKingMuninn: @abracablacka  ps5 dethroned it
[5:50:41] raiwist: portability
[5:50:42] taintalizerx: switch only has 30fps? i dont notice it i play it daily lmfao
[5:50:50] sinlesssinner: yea its sold for 300$ , i shelved that shit switch and went for an xbox series S with gamepass, f nintento
[5:50:53] swordart_19: @givtater isn't it weaker than phones for same price?
[5:51:05] IianaDRK: isnt switch last gen?
[5:51:08] dwrfygames: you on alliance or horde right now ?
[5:51:22] Nehcrom: @Sollice What was the maid outfit subathon goal again?
[5:51:22] Moobot: Towelliee is playing on Server US EAST - Regulus for Lost Ark!
[5:51:28] woehaaa: gender X
[5:51:34] shimwood: Joy Cons are, like, $70 for one and people are buying up 10 of them
[5:51:46] 91Niki: Nintendo is living in their own little world LUL
[5:51:46] magemaster225: tbf XBSX and PS5 are still last gen right now lol
[5:51:46] Sollice: Not sure
[5:51:47] Mr_O: at the same time with Covid people where stuck at home so people bought that shit for more entertainment
[5:51:48] Lifestream7: Switch is like on Gen with PS5 and i beleive they just always release earlier
[5:51:50] RetiredNavyVet: well, thats the right time so... $$$
[5:51:52] NVbrutal: nintendo is 3-5 gens behind anyways lol
[5:51:54] Honvar: The KFConsole is great Kappa
[5:51:55] Putcride: the nintendo switch is the same gen as ps4 and xbox
[5:52:00] Sollice: It’s whatever gen they want it to be

[6:21:31] rensdeamo: My math teacher told me - that with a 0.01% chance - each time - Its like winning the lotto It cant get over 100% unless you got the mount at 100

[6:21:33] Broomba: i think its bugged
[6:21:47] GodKingMuninn: @Shongoshi  Welcome to statistics
[6:21:55] rensdeamo: Mount win = 100%

[6:22:38] Eggz1004: 50+?
[6:22:52] QQuirashi: oh shiyt love rocket! is it limited to level 50+?
[6:23:06] rensdeamo: Its RNG - you start over each time -- so showing 98.87 chance is bogus
[6:23:08] kiwidakoalagi: @Towelliee you plan to make alts in Lost ark? Which class other than Pally do you like?
[6:23:16] Nick_Vs_Games: or maybe make it 100% drop when timewalking for that expansion drops

[6:24:15] Thasin22: How do you link your twitch to lost ark for the drops?

[6:31:04] NonstopCC: Love watching twitch and supporting channels when I can. I don’t understand why content creators make the judgment on spending money on in game stuff. But when a person drops 10k on a streamer it’s fine and not considered dumb. All respect though just my perspective. Been listening to you each day lately while working and enjoying it. Thanks.
[6:31:34] geokouts: its f2p game so expect microtransactions

[6:32:18] kiwidakoalagi: Man 15 bucks is super cheap for a game like Lost Ark, bronze pack is great
[6:32:30] IianaDRK: theyre saying its hypocritical that people say its dumb to judge people spending tons of money on mtx but when people give the same amount to streamers as donations it isnt
[6:32:36] IianaDRK: if i understand right
[6:32:41] SauceFu: I think he is saying it's dumb you get judge spending money on games but the viewer doesn't get judge for dropping $10K on a streamer
[6:32:42] homewrecker101: Rockstar has confirmed that a new Grand Theft Auto is 'well underway.'

I purchase a lot of in game stuff but I think I misunderstood you when you said spend 10k on upgrading your gear from the store like a dumbass didn’t resonate with me. But I think maybe you said it because pvp and the hardest raids are equalized with gear. So there is no need to spend 10k since it won’t matter in those scenarios.

[7:24:48] TiredKorok: TiredKorok subscribed with Prime. 
[7:24:50] inj0shwetrust: as much as I hate Fatscribe it is a good fight
[7:24:56] Maruika: Whats the worst raid of all time. Trial of crusader ?
[7:24:57] inj0shwetrust: Its just having a group that can do it
[7:24:59] HaxzorJimDuggan: bfa had some fun mythic fights, that treasure room hallway fight in bod is one of my fav
[7:25:01] magemaster225: Crucible
[7:25:02] aleck1776: Ouch AQ 20 yeah thats rough
[7:25:06] r0b928: Dragon soul
[7:25:09] fat_european0: Hyjal sucked
[7:25:10] inj0shwetrust: Painsmith is the same way
[7:25:14] Screamnsteam: Nyalotha Trash asmonGASM
[7:25:16] Bazsidiver: whats wrong with aq 20?
[7:25:19] tictoc456: well we tried thanks for the run @towelliee
[7:25:21] Broma2030: Dragon soul was great
[7:25:26] Brandishblade: ulduar
[7:25:30] MrGrimms: @Towelliee ruby sanctum...
[7:25:30] Kisswani: and fucking spine
[7:25:31] aleck1776: Hyjal isnt bad but the trash is annoying
[7:25:40] Wcvechten: Thought Ruby Sanctum, for a pushover, was kinda neat
[7:25:41] Lothlorienbgd: I liked the ending of dragon soul LUL
[7:25:43] jeffnsteff2019: wife spent 12 hrs in naxx farming tier back in WOTLK on DKP system was a horrible nightmare
[7:25:46] Templexx: or did it even end o.0
[7:26:02] IianaDRK: deathwing disney explosion
[7:26:02] jeffnsteff2019: TOT was one my favor raids
[7:26:03] TiredKorok: Love this stream, I've checked out a lot of WoW streamers but always end up back here
[7:26:03] Wcvechten: Cataclysm also had very little to do at the end imo
[7:26:09] ScottysBeamin: I remember being rogue  class leader in BT calling out kicks on souls in BT lol good times
[7:26:10] IianaDRK: dude blackwing descent was awesome
[7:26:10] Henke1983: Cata > Legion
[7:26:11] DwarfWarrior25: i loved Cata expansion was really good lore wise
[7:26:16] r0b928: Cata is my most played expansion
[7:26:36] DrakhanGaming: Cata sucked lol
[7:26:40] Molvonos: I mean, Onyxia 3.6a, Nefarian 2.0, and Skipped Leg-day Ragnaros 2.0 wasn't too inspired./
[7:26:55] fat_european0: Personally SoD is up there as one of the weakest tiers imo. Mostly because of how trivial it was with full shards.
[7:26:58] magemaster225: raid tier maker :P
[7:27:03] IianaDRK: good fight but i hate his legs lol
[7:27:05] fat_european0: Rag HC was amazing
[7:27:16] Brandishblade: Cata was a great time. its when allthe streamers blew up too.
[7:27:16] luckfore: nighthold my favorite raid
[7:27:28] MrGrimms: I think Rag HC was one of the best holy shit moments in a raid..
[7:27:50] Densetsu_: I would rather have a few ruby sanctums here and there than a 1.5 year drought
[7:27:52] ScottysBeamin: I'm not confident
[7:27:54] cabalish: visuals + dark mode
[7:27:56] Brandishblade: top 3 raids??
[7:28:01] Wcvechten: I really, really hope they nail the tuning on Sepulcher
[7:28:02] mqhunter: is the warglaives transmog still dh only?
[7:28:03] fat_european0: inky black potion
[7:28:08] fat_european0: I did first ptr test, it was insane
[7:28:12] Kisswani: Can't wait for the last 3 bosses , the Algalon - like boss alone is something to look for
[7:28:23] venomh456: what are u think about throne of thunder?
[7:28:29] Throdio: Inky back potion is one of the best things ever added
[7:28:40] Throdio: I just which it didn't affect the skybox so much
[7:28:48] Daggerstry: You farming Mog or the mount?
[7:29:12] DwarfWarrior25: SPOILERS
[7:29:15] ScottysBeamin: have to say healing guardian the first time on heroic was a bitch lol 10k+
[7:29:54] jeffnsteff2019: 9.2 might be redeemer patch of shadowlands
[7:29:57] Orthobullet: I wish arthas would actually show up
[7:30:11] KragnosWoW: uldir was my least favorite raid
[7:30:14] DwarfWarrior25: Fuck Anduim i hope we kill him, never liked Anduin as a NPC
[7:30:22] mqhunter: is it arthas or is it the part of frostmourne that controlled arthas (or some shit)
[7:30:23] fat_european0: They changed it so you gain a dmg increased buff from Anduin when you enter that phase
[7:30:27] shkolnik_prahramist: !LA
[7:30:27] Moobot: @shkolnik_prahramist Lost Ark is nearly here!

[7:30:28] fat_european0: so it'll be a heavy burn phase
[7:30:29] ijuki: A serious question though, which boss might be a cockblock?
[7:30:37] ScottysBeamin: he gets redeemed
[7:30:37] DwarfWarrior25: unfortunate =(
[7:30:56] mavericks312: everyone out here wanting anduin an sylvanas dead lol
[7:31:00] jeffnsteff2019: anduin is gonna be a critical poltical focus in 10.0
[7:31:04] the_general01: @DwarfWarrior25 by that logic, sylvannis needs to die
[7:31:09] ClipCraft: spoilers O.o
[7:31:12] ScottysBeamin: But I'm back now lol
[7:31:18] CaptainZiman: lobotomized :)
[7:31:28] DwarfWarrior25: Nope ALL HAIL SYLVANAS
[7:31:33] Kisswani: damn
[7:31:39] luckfore: he knows POGGERS
[7:31:40] mrz_as: i think they gonna make jailer hard because they faild lore wise about him but good boss gameplay wise
[7:31:40] Kisswani: that would be top 10 anime betrayals
[7:31:45] fat_european0: I hope we finally get to kill Sylvanas
[7:31:50] Wcvechten: they might not see him fit to lead, or use his inasnity to spur some crazy light shenanigans or somethings
[7:31:55] mavericks312: sparking thrall and Jaina siding with anduin ushering in cross faction guilds
[7:31:56] Brandishblade: feeling traumatized about killing people when he talking to player character...lul
[7:32:02] the_general01: @DwarfWarrior25 sociopath lol
[7:32:08] ScottysBeamin: should totally do the Scarlett  crusade as a separate faction
[7:32:13] fat_european0: I think lihuvim might be a mid tier wall
[7:32:14] jerexify: @Towelliee The one with all the covenant leaders looks ridiculous.
[7:32:17] theDirtyon3: didnt they redo a few bosses too
[7:32:18] theDirtyon3: ?
[7:32:23] sunmx: does xymoz die? or he run away again
[7:32:26] DwarfWarrior25: yup XD
[7:32:31] ScottysBeamin: they dropped hints during bfa
[7:32:33] the_general01: XD
[7:32:47] Kisswani: it looked super chaotic tho
[7:32:59] TipsyT90: @Towelliee Why does GFuel not make Vape Flavors? You need to pioneer that.
[7:33:02] the_general01: didnt they just completely redo a couple fights?
[7:33:08] fat_european0: Pantheon is one of those fights where there's just too many mechanics for it to be difficult considering where it is in the raid
[7:33:24] fat_european0: If it was final 3 it'd probably be really hard
[7:33:31] RetiredNavyVet: @Towelliee got enough toons to hit 100%?
[7:33:37] the_general01: i cant remember but max was talking about it on his twitter
[7:33:42] Orrkkyy: anduin got changed
[7:33:43] Moobot: Towelliee is playing on Server US EAST - Regulus for Lost Ark!
[7:33:52] ScottysBeamin: if Scarlett crusade became a separate faction. I'm in lol
[7:33:59] Orrkkyy: and that spider tank boss i think

[7:34:04] AntC92: would you rather be addicted to nicotine or wow
[7:34:14] Anneris1: a lot of them
[7:34:14] Screamnsteam: @tipsyt90 probably because vape flavors aren’t the origin of the flavor lmao?
[7:34:19] ScottysBeamin: bfa leaks
[7:34:22] fat_european0: they reworked Anduin, the crab & architect
[7:34:23] magemaster225: Halondrus and now Lihuvim and Anduin according to Max
[7:34:31] the_general01: can i link max's tweet?
[7:34:37] Waspire: its just a possibility
[7:34:41] mavericks312: ppl want more scarletr crusade stuff?
[7:34:42] Durras2000: Just put in another order of GFuel, Ragin' Gummy Fish and Shiny Splash Hydration, used code TOWEL thanks my dude!
[7:34:43] RetiredNavyVet: non-race restricted factions would be awesome
[7:34:56] Kisswani: that's the tweet from Max https://twitter.com/maximum/status/1489011171143290882
[7:34:59] fat_european0: @Towelliee They changed it after testing. It was in the PTR builds this last 1-2 weeks
[7:35:00] luckfore: max is in a super super secret discord
[7:35:16] ScottysBeamin: they think anduin is a traitor and want to use genn as a tool
[7:35:48] Orthobullet: This week they changed anduin i believe
[7:36:18] MilesC453: Holy shit 454 attempts?
[7:36:24] Broma2030: Switching back to alliance in 9.2.5 ?
