[3:30:33] dawsonator171: What level is Erin? I made it to 25 and haven't logged.
[3:30:33] Devcomz: Hi Mes how are you?
[3:30:35] Devcomz: :)
[3:31:35] dawsonator171: anhak probably already full bis. man has teh RNG of a god.
[3:31:58] Devcomz: How's the games going?
[3:32:00] Austin6192: What beer you drinking my guy?
[3:32:36] Austin6192: What rum?
[3:33:25] Austin6192: I know budlight and busch thats it haha. I am aussie
[3:33:40] Devcomz: I haven't drank in years
[3:33:50] Devcomz: or well at least a year
[3:33:52] Devcomz: not years
[3:33:59] Anhak: @dawsonator171 ?????????????????????
[3:34:15] Anhak: i didnt get my bis wep til week 90 last phase
[3:34:24] Anhak: and for that rng i got good this time
[3:34:27] Devcomz: What dagger did you get?
[3:34:32] avenueone: rng of a god is getting the leggo wep off fyrakk at ilvl 430
[3:35:13] Anhak: dagger is good its technicly not bis but im never getting bis
[3:35:50] Devcomz: I got one of those Blood Moon pvp event daggers the offhand one then I got the main hand one and realized that you cant use both and was sad
[3:36:45] Anhak: the bloodmoon offhand is kinda troll
[3:36:53] Anhak: unless your using it for the effect in pvp

[3:37:11] Anhak: the one hand dagger is better in your offhand and mainhand so :/
[3:37:38] Devcomz: yeah Im using the WSG level 38 one and the one hand blood moon one now
[3:37:45] Devcomz: offhand kind of sitting in my bags
[3:37:57] Devcomz: Sentinal blade
[3:38:07] Anhak: so for pve u wanna get scrifical kris cause 1.4 speed
[3:38:13] Anhak: ap>tiger>agi
[3:38:32] Anhak: u probably can find a tiger or agi for like 20 gold if u check every few days
[3:38:41] Anhak: i got a 14 ap not a 16 ap for 50 gold
[3:38:58] Anhak: just know high rolls of ap tiger agi is better then low rolls same order tho
[3:39:10] Anhak: so a 14 ap is worst then 8 agi or 5/5 tiger
[3:39:10] Devcomz: Is Mutilate the play now since its 40 energy? I was thinking you would use two slow ones for hard hitting mut but I understand if my logic is flawed and wrong
[3:39:21] Anhak: its normized
[3:39:30] Anhak: so you can use 2 .5 speed damgers and its the same as 2 slow ones
[3:39:41] Devcomz: oh ok
[3:39:44] Anhak: so faster and more stats is most ideal cause poisons
[3:39:55] Devcomz: makes sense
[3:40:06] Devcomz: where did you get scarlet kris to drop
[3:40:09] dawsonator171: Anhak so lucky, he could boost a brand new warrior and get axe first kill on any difficulty.
[3:40:10] Devcomz: I can look it up too I guess
[3:42:16] dawsonator171: meanwhile mes has 542 heroic fyrakk kills and zero leggos, which is insane.
[3:44:04] Devcomz: Hey Mes out of curiosity what is your favorite DK PVP elite armor set? This seasons might be my new favorite personally
[3:45:47] Anhak: @Devcomz sacrificial kris not scarlet uh i think they can drop in raid lvl 39 so mostly like lvl 43 44 world drops
[3:45:57] Anhak: sorry was in an ab
[3:46:50] dawsonator171: seriously though mes, what are the odds at this point you don't have fyrakk weapon?
[3:46:54] Anhak: as for your actual bis dagger its gutripper lvl 40 epic it and the raid dagger are pretty close but gutripper has a better proc its just that simple
[3:49:10] Devcomz: @Anhak all g

[4:09:19] krome2dadome: @austin_545 making it less set up dependent and more consistent dam. it needs a reason to play the game outside of its CDs
[4:09:28] Aro725: shit they need that for pve too
[4:09:34] Aro725: DK needs a rework so bad imo
[4:09:46] Anhak: its crazy that feral got 30 min omen but shamans didnt get 30 min enhancments
[4:10:44] dawsonator171: Listen, only if they make feral more durable can they make DK more durable.
[4:10:45] austin_545: yeah that makes sense. pillar is the only time you have to respect them
[4:10:49] BetterknownasJohn: meanwhile uh is fine besides the flop
[4:11:21] Anhak: @dawsonator171 feral is FINE
[4:11:58] Anhak: daws is gonna join us and powershift to rank 1 in p3
[4:12:20] Skars111: isnt there 2 dk comps teams in the awc atm though?
[4:12:57] Skars111: yes
[4:13:26] BetterknownasJohn: just bring back s14 necrotic strike
[4:13:49] Rainbowmes: the only two dk comps in awc both lost and only have wins against the inferior dk comp
[4:14:00] Rainbowmes: the only thing a dk can beat is another dk
[4:14:14] MaybeRespect: Nah DK needs a toolkit update real bad. Living in the past compared to most classes.
[4:14:22] Anhak: is s10 or s14 necro stronger hmm
[4:14:36] Rainbowmes: problem being devs think dk is good so that should give you an idea
[4:15:01] Rainbowmes: complete disconnect from what the state of the game is
[4:15:10] c0jaK: i think they should increase fear damage
[4:15:26] austin_545: roll it back to the first week of DF where DK was unkillable lmao

[4:55:39] Yoskexz: what if tank dh is slept on samiPog
[4:55:40] goatskull123: ngl I think the class design for DH is top notch
[4:55:44] rizdane: amazing is the word you use?
[4:55:54] c0jaK: shadow priest is my favorite
[4:56:01] c0jaK: because it changes every season
[4:56:03] c0jaK: sometimes less
[4:56:13] rizdane: dh class design is out of the spectrum for world of warcraft
[4:56:49] sinndicate: @AnAnonymousGifter Thanks for the gift sub!
[4:57:37] Dwilk20: How about we remove all Shadowlands covenant talents
[4:57:43] Dwilk20: out of the game
[4:57:44] c0jaK: i only like DH when EB is good
[4:57:55] goatskull123: Hmm I think fel barrage and EB is good
[4:57:56] rizdane: there really isnt a rotation though. you have like 3 dmg modifiers and thats it
[4:58:23] goatskull123: the fact that EB kinda locks you into a specific rotation and the fact that it is 5 s is good imo
[4:58:26] rizdane: fel barrage is bad and the cd is too high
[4:59:05] Rainbowmes: oh damn i get the 29 now 666
[4:59:17] Aro725: I think the hunt feels really good in pve
[5:00:27] goatskull123: The hunt effect has amazing visual and audio feedback, and that's why it feels amazing to press
[5:00:49] goatskull123: and it fits the DH fantasy i think
[5:02:55] athathedruid: athathedruid subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 2 months!

[5:03:23] Rainbowmes: and there it goes :(
[5:04:22] krome2dadome: @notmes thoughts on double mastery embellishes vs. one mastery & boots for dh?

[5:15:42] Solushun: or mentally
[5:16:03] americanmoses18: can you imagine if
[5:16:17] happyheals: If Sol can make it through an RBG with us without leaving
[5:16:28] c0jaK: remove a button
[5:16:29] fearsii: letting them be gnomes
[5:16:31] imjonny1: reduce overall dmg 3%
[5:16:35] trollmasta66: prob nerf glaive
[5:16:43] swigiggity: nerf soulrend dot a bit
[5:16:46] krome2dadome: nerf blur CD, nerf the fact that it'
[5:16:47] goatskull123: just nerf glaive
[5:16:51] krome2dadome: it's basically evasion*
[5:16:55] trollmasta66: prob is with set you get like 32 buttons with one dance
[5:17:01] azulboom: glimps 30s
[5:17:03] shugguls: blur 1.5min cd, 40 sec on glimps
[5:17:11] IamWalnuts: 30% damage nerf flat :) i just want to watch the world burn
[5:17:23] azulboom: 100%
[5:17:24] shugguls: yes
[5:17:25] krome2dadome: yes
[5:17:29] happyheals: it is all the leech
[5:17:30] azulboom: i mostly dont die as dh
[5:17:35] shugguls: 20% likly to be first kill
[5:17:38] Aro725: nah there defensives come from offense, if you cant attack you die
[5:17:39] poodzztv: they have to pre blurr goes on them or they die
[5:17:45] happyheals: with meta
[5:17:48] krome2dadome: i feel unkillable on my dh compared to any other melee (besides rogue ofc)
[5:17:56] poodzztv: @Aro725 you are right
[5:18:01] happyheals: DH is well built imo
[5:18:10] happyheals: just a bit stronger.
[5:18:10] goatskull123: increase blur CD and add CDR to it
[5:18:45] nikthevoker: nerf glimpse
[5:18:51] Aro725: it would have to be a pvp nerf though. They are pretty good in pve where they are. Id imagine it would just be a pvp aura nerf
[5:18:53] happyheals: I would say bring other classes up at this point
[5:19:18] Yoskexz: is there a way i can swap disengage for glimpse thru the game shop Kappa
[5:19:19] ohshiieett: i wish they never gave havoc sigils, it's always been such a yikes from me
[5:19:30] nikthevoker: glimpse is just so good
[5:19:42] nikthevoker: for def and off
[5:19:59] c0jaK: just remove double jump
[5:20:00] Yoskexz: ill have to buy the wings pack

[5:20:27] ImHomegr0wn: dh had silence sigil in beta for a short while lol
[5:20:33] Bobxsr: Make Glimpse reduce damage taken by 50% but take away the immunity.
[5:20:36] happyheals: should have left sigils to Tank
[5:20:42] c0jaK: havoc sigils are definitely tacked on
[5:20:43] Aro725: it generates a ton of fury in pve
[5:20:45] Yoskexz: dh wings + glimpse bundle for $20 samiHype
[5:20:50] goatskull123: the flame sigil gives you fury no?
[5:20:59] Aro725: just need a couple targets
[5:21:00] Solushun: is there an enchants/treants bundle? @Yoskexz

[5:22:58] Aro725: im jk i just hate the oblit dnd cleave
[5:23:51] Aro725: feels so bad if you have to move. I think they just put sigils in cause Vengeance had them and they ran out of things for the class tree

[5:24:48] c0jaK: rjw here i come
[5:24:59] iLLwiLL_HS: so is there not going to be pvp tuning on tues?
[5:25:15] shugguls: dont think so
[5:25:50] goatskull123: the only thing I don't like about DnD for unholy is the visual
[5:26:05] goatskull123: it's not as hard to place it properly in m+ as everyone says
[5:26:26] shugguls: @goatskull123 play defile , there is no visuals lol
[5:26:39] goatskull123: yeah I meant defike
[5:26:41] goatskull123: defile*
[5:27:12] happyheals: I like playing my warr a lot
[5:27:15] shugguls: i just made a DH, it feels so dirty compared to my arms warriors
[5:27:23] Yoskexz: play a fw
[5:27:29] happyheals: fury is fun
[5:27:40] Solushun: -_-
[5:27:44] dawsonator171: let's play FW jungle wiht yoske
[5:27:44] krome2dadome: yea it's so much fun never winning
[5:27:52] sherbondo: could play ret :)
[5:27:52] dawsonator171: SV feral FW
[5:27:53] nikthevoker: mes FW mesferal or mesvoker all sound good
[5:28:01] Solushun: mes devistation evoker
[5:28:20] krome2dadome: didn't hear mb
[5:28:21] dawsonator171: Mesistion Evoker.
[5:28:23] krome2dadome: what u say?
[5:28:24] shugguls: defensive - there all rubbish and effected by damp
[5:28:24] iLLwiLL_HS: fury has zero cc immunity
[5:28:30] dawsonator171: spelling
[5:28:31] dawsonator171: holy shit.
[5:28:33] nikthevoker: what does fury need
[5:28:43] nikthevoker: @krome2dadome
[5:28:57] krome2dadome: fury needs to not die through it's wall. and also not only have a single 2min defensive
[5:28:59] shugguls: fury needs defensive and a meaning full button
[5:29:58] happyheals: Fury doesn't have that 2 bladestorm when needed to get out of things
[5:30:24] Yoskexz: the problem with fury is that its not a dh or rog
[5:30:25] nikthevoker: arms has 15sec cc immunity
[5:30:31] krome2dadome: no ignore pain, no bladestorm 24/7, no parry on 1.5min cd
[5:30:35] goatskull123: btw one thing I find OP about immunity defensives is that they help a lot at lower solo shuff ratings when healers are bad
[5:30:51] smellyprince: mes do you like sod?
[5:30:51] happyheals: fury can lock a healer down maybe better than any class
[5:30:57] goatskull123: sometimes that 5-8 seconds of being undamageable win games when both helaers are bad
[5:31:03] nikthevoker: ya its offensive
[5:31:31] nikthevoker: every DH in shuffle sends it 1st global
[5:31:42] nikthevoker: legit throw glaive, glimpse
[5:31:45] happyheals: as fury you have to pick movement or fear, as well as a couple others
[5:32:02] Aro725: yeah the warrior class tree is ass

[7:38:32] Vigi9413: ven should put DH right where it goes in D tier
[7:39:12] Blaze150000: dont be mad about a class.. its the f**** blizzard balancing
[7:39:12] waitimdesyncd: I think Dev is A tier in LFG and SS, and S tier if you have teammates that know you only have 25-30 yard range and gets out ranged by enemy casters
[7:40:10] krome2dadome: the "2700 fury warr" btw LOL https://imgur.com/a/VIBF61n

[7:40:50] happyheals: felt lackluster with mobility
[7:40:56] krome2dadome: it's really bad

[7:41:07] wowsuomi: #showtooltip Kick /cast [target=focus, exists, harm, nodead] Shadowstep /cast [target=focus, exists, harm, nodead] Kick /cast [@cursor] Grappling Hook
[7:41:09] waitimdesyncd: WW a tier it has so many comps in LFG
[7:41:12] happyheals: dmg is amazing though when you can actually stay on a target
[7:41:18] indithedog: ret same worse than devoker?

[7:43:06] waitimdesyncd: damn yeah ret being played a lot now
[7:43:14] ohsomagical_: sub only 5%, buff rogues
[7:43:19] Hammer90x: i mean just because more people play it doesnt mean it's a stronger spec, just easier to play
[7:43:33] krome2dadome: participation of a spec is never a good metric of power
[7:43:50] krome2dadome: so i hate when ppl use those graphs
[7:44:20] Vigi9413: nah
[7:44:22] Xenon_cl: spriest is s tier

[7:44:59] Vigi9413: i feel terrible on my warrior
[7:45:08] Vigi9413: but i think that's cause blizzard cucked me
[7:45:17] nikthevoker: id hhave a stroke too with DH/outlaw chasing me

The key determinant for persistent production of lactase in an individual is not the frequency of lactose consumption, but rather the individual's genetic makeup."
