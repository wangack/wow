[1:37:06] JmanOwnz: damn that's what i figured
[1:37:07] buffevoker: Yeah i think alot of People who play it dont pick that point which increases empower by one
[1:37:21] crusadein: @JmanOwnz ctrl, shift, alt if youre fancy and dont care about jumping space bar can also caps lock
[1:37:40] xK3V1N4T0Rx: @jmanownz just gotta play and figure out which buttons go where
[1:38:02] JmanOwnz: @crusadein I appreciate it and i use that plus the mmo mouse, but usually only go up 1-6
[1:38:20] JmanOwnz: @xK3V1N4T0Rx you right i need to just stick with it
[1:38:22] zachgamegodx: but it's fake dmg reduction right
[1:38:59] xK3V1N4T0Rx: Buttons you use pretty frequently should be close to where your fingers are whether you use a mouse with a million buttons on the side or using 1234 on your keyboard
[1:39:13] zachgamegodx: all feels like you're missing something important
[1:39:46] zachgamegodx: would ya react to some of the hero talents for youtube content or nah?
[1:39:53] xK3V1N4T0Rx: CDs like Healing Tide or Ascendance should be regarding out of the way since you use those a bit more infrequently
[1:39:55] buffevoker: We are waiting for that its going to be banger
[1:40:02] zachgamegodx: would love to see ya react to em
[1:40:05] zachgamegodx: for twitch content

[2:25:21] kaoreal: Find the one that says diesel
[2:25:22] tino_sv: that's what I miss the most lol
[2:25:23] PaladeusTV: some states they must pump gas for you
[2:25:27] serverfirst300003: what does that even mean? U cant put a pump into a hole?
[2:25:32] biofreaks: twitch live stream of the boys in the car?!?
[2:25:38] moldybread00: thats wild lmao
[2:25:39] laha1n: take the gascap off, put the nozzle in, select the fuel, press the lever done
[2:25:46] mrjollyvolly: Thats what she said
[2:25:46] nameyourform: spit on it first
[2:25:47] indithedog: is he trolling?
[2:25:47] laha1n: it does
[2:25:48] eygton: you  gotta tip the person doing the gas?
[2:25:48] chubmax: bro what in the lords name
[2:25:49] Diobg: you swipe your card first breh

[2:25:55] zachgamegodx: you can have someone pump your gas you just tip a few bucks in any state you know that right
[2:25:56] Grimm303: push the button to select grade, then stick in and pull lever and it locks
[2:25:58] laha1n: if people in alabama can do it you can too
[2:25:58] shivwren: @nameyourform dewLUL
[2:25:59] PaladeusTV: you gotta do it right or you blow up
[2:26:10] chancywilson: Its very simple you wont have aa problem
[2:26:12] chubmax: card -> lift and insert nozzle -> pick gas grade -> pump
[2:26:12] DontDv8: you select the fuel grade first after payment, then put the nozzle in the tank and clock the trigger to the locked position
[2:26:24] iggy_pls: you can just ask for help when you get there lol no big deal
[2:26:26] DontDv8: leave the car on first obviously

[2:26:43] Artiriouz: it wont come out unless you press the trigger lol
[2:26:45] nameyourform: say no to the car wash prompt
[2:26:45] forshard: You walk up to pump, put in your credit card/debit/etc, it reads it, you take the nozzle out, select the gas you want (unleaded), then pull the trigger and theres a lil latch thats easy to figure out. when its full the latch pops off and it automatically shuts off
[2:26:45] Fixit_cat: Facetime the Mayimas and have him walk you through it
[2:26:48] chubmax: @DontDv8 LOL make sure to bring some electricity too
[2:26:48] GoGoGarrett: don't tempt me with a good time
[2:26:49] Eclipse1224: it doesnt squirt you have to hold down the pump for it to do that

[2:27:05] chancywilson: you squeeze lever for gas to start
[2:27:08] Doyol: that is insane to me that NJ doesnt let you pump your own gas
[2:27:10] zachgamegodx: my guy can’t pump fckin gas
[2:27:11] serverfirst300003: bro u gonna be like this chikc from TIkTok, holding the pump with fueling just blasting out of it screaming " I DONT KNOW WHAT TO DO! WHAT DO I DO?"
[2:27:11] veilsidedk: just go in - pay the cashier like $100 and then take the pump out and select ur grade and stick er in.
[2:27:18] macdeezyx: pay > remove nozel > select grade > insert nozel > pull trigger on handle
[2:27:20] chubmax: at least you know what side of the car its on
[2:27:22] Artiriouz: how old are you chuck and you dont know how to pump gas? KEKW
[2:27:23] doinkripper1: when i got my new car it took me forever to figure out that i had to press unlock on my keys to unlock the gas tank lmao
[2:27:23] chubmax: the gas nozzle

[2:27:46] chancywilson: ya @pestyxd fun stuff
[2:27:49] ImagineMcgee: you know what grade your car uses?
[2:27:50] Ey_an: in australia theres different nozzles for each type you don't press a button to get different
[2:27:50] mrjollyvolly: You can also fill up a couple plastic bags with gas then figure it out when you get home instead
[2:27:54] Frostyjoneslol: @cdewx just google it before you go, i do it every year before i go deer hunting for gutting, if i can gut a deer u can pump gas lol
