[0:03:43] mmarkers: each stat has its own name, gotta check the order person
[0:03:48] zachgamegodx: what are u and richie playing tn buddy?
[0:03:59] zachgamegodx: FINALLLY A NEW DPS ALT BTW
[0:04:02] zachgamegodx: YAY
[0:04:07] Malte_L: ayo
[0:05:31] FoxiekittenWoW: yo
[0:05:40] mmarkers: how u feel about this mastery meta for every healer. Not only healing not as fun as dps in nature, but also forced to play the game slower w/o haste
[0:06:16] TacobellWOW: gimme yo buffs
[0:06:17] FoxiekittenWoW: any druid shenanigans tonight?
[0:06:49] zachgamegodx: that dudes gonna burn the place down if u dont go now

[0:08:19] FoxiekittenWoW: @mmarkers I feel like you have so many stats this season so you have plenty of haste even if you also have a lot of mastery. I’m soft capped on mastery and still have over 20% haste on both my Druid and priest healer.
[0:08:44] nameyourform: yooo
[0:09:18] theoggaillewis: could i get your copy for restro sham 3s or shuff if sdame
[0:09:20] McLarge: I would say it's also not just healers that are super Mastery heavy. Off the top of my head, almost every melee plays Mastery over the Haste or Crit
[0:09:25] theoggaillewis: oh you ele rn
[0:09:25] Moobot: Follow me! https://twitter.com/cdew_wow https://www.youtube.com/tenderloinx1
[0:10:44] Kramoune: Kramoune subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 19 months! 
[0:10:48] mmarkers: true this season is better than previous. But for ex: Cdew has 8% haste thats a 1.4s GCD vs every energy class with 1s gcd and most casters with around 1.1-2. Your decisions matter more as a healer yet you are playing the game in slow motion compared to a rogue
[0:11:16] crucybletv: just do viewer skirms and q healer ez game
[0:11:19] ThatRandomWhiteKid: @mmarkers oh hi
[0:11:22] sharpdressedman15: ele?
[0:11:25] mmarkers: exaggerated "slow motion" but its quite a large difference over a game
[0:11:26] crucybletv: you can do 3s
[0:11:39] crucybletv: healers randomly q all the time
[0:11:43] Bullvaj: ae ofc
[0:11:47] isomething: no but we can double dps it up
[0:11:58] cruelhabbitts: yea it’s random
[0:12:02] OGBeads: i prefer the additional maelstrom from flame shock, in 3s with a ton of flameshocks out you can just cycle earthshock lavaburst for so long
[0:12:03] theoggaillewis: can i get restro sham buidl pelase
[0:12:04] zachgamegodx: u realize ud make 2 ppls day if u healed em in a skirm
[0:12:32] mahz: Big week fam. Super excited for awc and mdi
[0:12:39] Bullvaj: where did u get ur titel from?
[0:12:53] Not_J_o_n: How many outlaw rogues we gonna see in awc dew
[0:13:05] miserybro: good morning Dew
[0:13:22] sharpdressedman15: that rogue is going to tell the story of how he crushed awc champ cdew in a skirm for the rest of his life
[0:13:41] miserybro: how are the games today?

[5:16:34] boltqt_: Thats a real reductionist view point @iufoz
[5:17:06] trollmasta66: so is combat rogue just good because of the cc and cleave?
[5:18:26] Cocoapuffs1: having short cd on stuns, hard to kill, as well as good dam
[5:18:26] Sixxtylol: i think it’s also due to sub getting a nerf recently @trollmasta66
[5:19:42] mnowpsn: this game seems so damp ):
[5:20:14] knappster15: @mnowpsn last week people were complaining they die 100>0 in 1s, so now we're in dampen meta
[5:20:24] bcarnagex: Does rouge Shadowy Duel dr? If you played double rouge could one rouge duel, almost kill, then next rouge duel? or will it not work two times in a row? Anyone know?

[5:21:55] iufoz: @boltqt_ maybe, but i never did arena, so im prolly just ignorant or w/e im trying to see whats happening... but im so confused
[5:22:42] iufoz: what im seeing is that cdew gets to play for like 30% of the match, rest of the time he is either sheeped, sapped, hexed, clone or any other type of cc
[5:22:46] iufoz: while his team is doing dmg

[5:23:05] Pontacos: His team has very similar cc with clone instead of sheep
[5:23:05] iufoz: I'd fucking hate being a healer... like JUST LET ME PLAY MY CHAR
[5:23:07] iufoz: GOoD
[5:23:09] izza_cat: @iufoz thats what its like being a healer
[5:23:20] iufoz: FRICK
[5:23:31] iufoz: might be why i've always been a pve andy
[5:23:51] iufoz: prefere dealing with predictable one shots, than fucking not being able to even play
[5:24:08] RealXrave: yep, play ur char for 2-5 sec intervals
[5:24:08] iufoz: or get someone to10% hp, then watch them pop some donkley 90% defensive, and get full hp
[5:24:19] RealXrave: ccd for 24 sec out of every 30 sec NODDERS
[5:24:27] iufoz: I'd hate my life if i ever did arena
[5:25:23] swolecolemole: dr blind and horror, still almost kills #skillful
[5:25:41] iufoz: Explain to me like im 5... but is Cdew considered high rated atm?
[5:25:42] Moobot: Follow me! https://twitter.com/cdew_wow https://www.youtube.com/tenderloinx1
[5:25:45] iufoz: or is he still grinding?
[5:26:23] spayvee: @iufoz high rating, this game right now could be the AWC final

[5:27:38] iufoz: well from my PoV im seeing sap, gouge, fear, poly, into a hex, into root, then kidney, into a cheap in to silence, and back to gouge and cheap and so and so on
[5:27:51] Pontacos: Welcome to wow arena with rogues
[5:27:53] iufoz: Fml
[5:28:22] iufoz: imma just be honst... im not a pvp player and i think I just embrace that
[5:28:30] iufoz: this is NOT my juice xdd
[5:28:35] RealXrave: if you play a healer and decide to arena go in knowing that when you queue into a rogue they can make your life hell
[5:29:13] Pontacos: Arena is fun and this is insane gameplay here
[5:29:19] Pontacos: most teams cant chain cc like that at lower levels
[5:29:28] iufoz: and also, seeing as rogue on cedw team jsut went to 5% my blood preassure and cortisol levels would be off the roof
[5:29:32] iufoz: i'd be stressed to shit

[5:36:10] dooshken: gachiGASM
[5:36:34] Pontacos: But if you focus on learning your class well it makes it easier to focus on enemies because dmg and cc is auto pilot

[5:42:00] courtappointedhealer: It's crazy how little he hard casts heals and keeps his mana up. He gets so much value from stream/earthen/ns. But watching pika kill his totems and how bad link is makes me sad.
[5:42:00] noxyshama: just leave
[5:42:09] noxyshama: 2v3
[5:42:14] noxyshama: oh dude we can win! im a dh

[5:47:50] iufoz: what does penalty mean in terms of stats??
[5:47:57] iufoz: watching the guide
[5:47:59] iufoz: im confused
[5:48:21] Frostyjoneslol: that the Diminishing return portion? u get less stat per point of stat once u get over like 25% then 35%
[5:48:41] krome2dadome: @Frostyjoneslol 30 and 40
[5:48:49] Yaeo: wish lava burst did a small heal or hot to teammates. rly wana play more aggro rsham
[5:49:25] iufoz: @Frostyjoneslol i seee.... so its when u're over capped
[5:49:30] iufoz: rest of stat gives less
[5:49:32] iufoz: I see
[5:49:50] Frostyjoneslol: @iufoz i mean its not really a cap, sometimes even over a DR that stat will still give more raw power gain then grabbing a different stat
[5:50:03] iufoz: kind of all i needed to know, numbers doesnt means hit xdd
[5:50:08] iufoz: @Frostyjoneslol thats fine :)
[5:50:17] iufoz: Just needed the general idea on what it ment
[5:50:17] Ristvakbaen1911: Odd question, do AWC tourny rules dictate a specific comp? Like you have to do heal/2DPS or could you technically slam tank/heal/DPS or 3 DPS?
[5:50:46] Laythos: wheres the vate vate vate mindset at Kappa get that but for yourself
[5:50:49] bulletfacial: which guide are you watching?  im curious to get mor einfo on this, ive always thought it was bad to be over 30%.  and hes at 136% lol

[7:08:36] kaounallah: you need to cross cc the sp

[7:09:14] kaounallah: i find it better with rdruid

[7:09:56] slickdaddyg69: 1 day for awc and u stream ur 3s games ? somebody asking for getting countered
[7:10:11] Mcnubex: @kaounallah So run down lock and cross cc sp on the healer traps?
[7:10:25] kaounallah: depends on what lock it is. its a hard comp
[7:10:31] kaounallah: you just need your traps to sit full

[7:24:03] Owlcopwn: ie, get banned
[7:24:10] Mortifiedwow: Wow
[7:24:12] awfulist: Glad they banned gdkp that means the gold I bought has more value KEKW
[7:24:14] Mortifiedwow: Nice look
[7:24:17] Drathimos: they should do that in classic too
[7:24:22] oskarber: @Owlcopwn so all that did gdkp is banned already, retroactively?  I mean economy is already fucked?

[7:29:12] enhancedrane: right less gold = more value
[7:29:16] mikey0105: if you've bought gold in sod press 1 in chat
[7:29:18] I_FanBoi_I: @awfulist no because gold next phase is gonna be 6-8g per quest or more
[7:29:30] Owlcopwn: prob
[7:29:33] f41s3sh3p4rd: eu soloq down anynone?
[7:29:33] flippard: will we be playing cata r shaman?
[7:29:38] Owlcopwn: weird they are only doing it on sod
[7:29:42] Owlcopwn: and not on classic and retail

[7:30:22] moldybread00: The second u do dispel it he's gonna get a free fear every time lmao
[7:30:24] warlord_packyak: they should just make the shit soulbound
[7:30:34] Drathimos: gdkp is only worth doing when the gear to effort ratio is in your favor. cata will make it worse than wotlk
[7:30:43] Drathimos: because cata raids are harder
[7:31:24] synzebru: eh i played cata recently, there's a handful of hard bosses in the xpac but outside of those it's easy
[7:31:24] dooshken: are healing spells frost?
[7:31:34] chrisiirc: they won a lot
[7:31:35] Amnonongus: problem with master of the elemnts is that its basically a dead talent wihtout instant lava surge procs which also requires a lot of flame shock globals
[7:31:39] Zaiyge: they were cookin
[7:31:42] niuZIXIao: they got farmed by ret/dh/druid
[7:31:42] Amnonongus: its basically a 2 point atlent
[7:31:47] juicymeld: they lost to ret/dh but then beat them
[7:31:48] nemeuxs: lowkey stuck like 2741 rating they lost a bunch
[7:31:54] chrisiirc: they tried the destro then went back to spriest
[7:32:35] chrisiirc: it just took longer than sp for them to kill
[7:32:36] Raebantv: Feeling confident for this week chuck?
[7:32:41] itzshenny: My druid i play with cant get stealth drinks because when he shadowmelds he says it keeps him in combat any reason for this

[7:59:33] hoppbopp: @Zerolol123 damn
[7:59:41] Shxcky: everyone talks about rogues and arcane being insane which are they but evok seems broken as wel
[8:00:50] Legionaire07: is it better to do dmg rather than using sleep walk for cc on healer?

[8:01:19] Yoskexz: he may be talking about aug :)
[8:01:21] Disemble: Stadman cranks the heals
[8:01:28] Shxcky: don’t think so? maybe just looks broken in your hands
[8:01:29] admiraltegetthoff: damn i wanted to see your dmg last game haha, you did a lot
[8:01:34] Shxcky: only watch you heal with it
[8:02:03] eriquewow: was that a AWC team?
[8:02:07] Shxcky: gotcha, don’t know much about the class
[8:02:10] MaybeRespect: Pres would break the game if the devs. watched your recent youtube video. LOL
[8:02:18] Shxcky: all the heals are close range type of thing?
[8:02:22] popzirl: anything looks crazy when r1s playing it and cdew arguably best healer overall ><
[8:02:30] Zerolol123: I think it's really funny that I hear teams in other streams mention "rooting the evoker" as a CC because it functions as such LUL
[8:02:30] Shxcky: ^
[8:02:39] peacant: is boomy stronger than arcane?
[8:02:40] Shxcky: wild lol
[8:02:49] Disemble: and yet you won blizzcon on NA with is!
[8:02:51] GutsInstinctTV: Do you think they'll ever increase the cast range, or does it not make sense to do that?
[8:02:55] Disemble: it*
[8:03:00] sharpdressedman15: sounds op af
[8:03:00] popzirl: clone is better than arcane imo
[8:03:06] Spacejelly: are you guys gonna play rps on tr? shit looks insane
[8:03:16] Disemble: its def not idea to be in that position for sure
[8:03:19] Disemble: ideal
[8:03:21] Zerolol123: @Spacejelly the move is the only RPS
[8:03:32] MaybeRespect: @Zerolol123 counter. Like bop to karma etc?
[8:03:36] proxyr6x: That's dumb af
[8:03:42] Shxcky: yeah that’s dumb asf
[8:03:46] barapersson: Has it always done that? the spell?
[8:03:48] popzirl: its such a big heallllll tho
[8:03:49] proxyr6x: Keep talking about it, maybe it'll get changed
[8:03:49] GutsInstinctTV: Hmm aye, that's a trick one alright
[8:03:54] Zaiyge: it was strong even with that mechanic tho
[8:03:54] Shxcky: don’t understand that class design
[8:04:02] moldybread00: Should be a pvp talent that makes verdant give you an im
[8:04:06] moldybread00: Immunity frame
[8:04:12] Zerolol123: yeah it's funny hearing "rooted the evoker he can't heal" LUL
[8:04:24] popzirl: if they change the animation to heal they'd have to drop the healing output on it
[8:04:35] MaybeRespect: So if they let you have range/no verdant leap would you be good without shroud?
[8:04:57] Shxcky: yeah like it’s OP until you have to use your actual healing abilities and get shoved into the middle
[8:05:02] peacant: is arcane better than boomkin?
[8:05:09] Drathimos: i think the logic behind it is they shove you in to the field to get a better angle for dream breath cone. they went a bit too cute on that logic
[8:05:10] classicteej: shroud isn't even that good
[8:05:18] MaybeRespect: Well...shroud is bad into rogue and mage ig.
[8:05:28] MaybeRespect: It's so good vs other melee and what not
[8:05:28] popzirl: its like to be annoying lol
[8:05:31] popzirl: waste some gcd
[8:05:59] Drathimos: shroud shouldnt be purgeable since its so easy to spam cc through it anyways
[8:06:00] Moobot: Follow me! https://twitter.com/cdew_wow https://www.youtube.com/tenderloinx1
[8:06:02] popzirl: yeah ik just like the ONLY purpose i mean
[8:06:08] sharpdressedman15: evoker best class in the game
[8:06:18] popzirl: into mage
[8:06:36] popzirl: its funny when pres shroud before rogue unstealth lol
[8:06:38] popzirl: sap sap sap
[8:06:39] rembrandt89: how come you guys dont practice sam on mage ever
[8:06:45] atoker: the problem is you give shroud to the mage, so you can't use it vs them
[8:07:13] FoxiekittenWoW: @rembrandt89 he doesn’t like mage in df
[8:07:14] bobthegoblin_: theoretically all pvp talents should be situational like shroud
[8:07:21] bobthegoblin_: so I dont think its bad
[8:07:35] atoker: and rogue just saps it off
[8:08:01] popzirl: well you dont use it before combat v rogue they cheap it off tho

[8:09:05] chrisiirc: destro is so badass
[8:09:10] chrisiirc: that portal stuff is so sick

[8:30:37] FoxiekittenWoW: @slaaneshdonkey just stand as close to a pillar as you can. when you are low rated it’s harder to always stay at a pillar because your team just runs wherever the fight goes.
[8:30:52] peatear19: @cdewx is sky shattered regalia the best shaman mog?
[8:31:08] bigfathead: t4?
[8:31:12] lordelenath: yeah, thats the biggest issue in low-mid rated solo shuffle: you can#t pillar as hard as a heal bc your DPS just runs all over.
[8:31:14] brazkat: T6 is skyshatter
[8:31:23] Kanooog: @FoxiekittenWoW True
[8:31:29] Yanzoh: are you guys going to stream qualifiers this round?

[8:31:49] Yanzoh: oh cool

[8:40:25] admiraltegetthoff: nah just straight up remove or make it dr with stun
[8:40:32] Braunijs: cheapshot just needs a cd
