[1:14:15] KragnosWoW: I set the bar as low as possible, so ill be excited if its a fraction of how good legion and mop were
[1:14:22] bondsmatthew: wonder if they'll meme on themselves during the stream
[1:14:32] PvtHudson093: It was Shadowlands leak all over again

[1:16:17] snake_like: please god make rogue abilities actually memorable this time

[1:25:06] chrslp: When I was at my peak I was playing probably 8-16hrs a day LUL
[1:25:07] BlueBeast33: can't vote since I haven't played since 9.1 launch
[1:25:14] Gustafvo: 15-20 seems legit. i study and got a wife lol and i put in 19 hours per week Kappa
[1:25:16] Persephonae: just raiding is usually at least 6 hours
[1:25:29] RUKIS420: prolly around 30hrs
[1:25:32] PvtHudson093: 6 hours in raid, 3/4 hours in M+ and then an hour+ a day doing dailies
[1:25:36] Heyhowsitgoingtonight: I play less than 15
[1:25:38] fadthl: Half that is just raiding for me
[1:25:47] RUKIS420: 3-4hrs after works and then on the weekends
[1:26:01] Persephonae: i spend 15h a week in uldaman like dang LUL
[1:26:18] snake_like: depending on how you play you just gonna plan your gametime. monday's key night, tues/wed raid, etc
[1:26:25] Heyhowsitgoingtonight: my peak was probably close to 100
[1:26:38] Gustafvo: @Heyhowsitgoingtonight damn mate, 100 how?!
[1:26:57] StreamElements: Use code POGTOWEL120 for $120 off at https://strms.net/TowellieeFactorMarBot #ad
[1:26:59] Morgothom: dpends on what you do, generally. if you're just raiding, 5-6 hours are already taken up just by that. doing m+ in addition to that, you'll go off the deep end
[1:27:06] chrslp: I feel like a lot more time was spent on single raids back in the day. People would be on hours a head of time to setup, then everyone would raid until people were passing out on their keyboards.
[1:27:11] Morgothom: one m+ is already 30-45mins if intime
[1:27:21] drazener: i guess my peak back in the days was like 6-70h a week. But as how i said this almost dropped me out of school so yea :P
[1:27:21] chrslp: Now people log on right before raid, speed through, and log off till next raid
[1:27:43] Heyhowsitgoingtonight: @gustafvo when I had no job or responsibilities
[1:27:59] Persephonae: more people than most realize play this game casually. i have many people in my community who have never seen the inside of a shadowlands dungeon but play 30+ hours a week

[1:29:12] chrslp: @drazener I had the exact same situation LUL 2008-2009 were my dark years of WoW. Ended up getting sent away to finish school LUL
[1:29:21] snake_like: yeah, I'm holding my catalyst charges for some more 278/285 gear
[1:29:26] tocu: I do think after 8 weeks they really should have opened it up to more than 1 catalyst
[1:29:28] mhelliker: stats change to predetermined stats when you convert to tier
[1:30:23] CritcobainTV: Yep
[1:30:27] Gustafvo: they should have opened it with 2 charges tbh, i only do M+ and have none atm. Don't like the raid so gonna be a week behind....
[1:30:30] PvtHudson093: yup
[1:30:34] CritcobainTV: the tier pieces are always same stats
[1:30:37] tocu: + any bonus procs like speed or leach
[1:30:45] CritcobainTV: so if your l egs have haste mastery, and u turn it into tier, it's crit vers
[1:31:11] Eregbueye: Ohh really
[1:31:13] snake_like: leather 278 helm boe about blow up on the AH
[1:31:21] CritcobainTV: helm legs
[1:31:28] PvtHudson093: you get to keep any sockets and leech,speed and avoidence
[1:31:36] DinkytheDoodle: @Towelliee you will also be able to convert wrist/waist/feet/back can be made into tier pc. However they wont count towards set bonus. They will give you a preset secondary stat setup.
[1:32:07] Persephonae: boutta max out my bnet balance lol

[2:19:07] Morpheusx25: @TADMG ah fellow vampire

[3:10:20] RageerPLZ: if everyone theory/leak was to be believed no one would leave their houses and we would all be wearing tinfoil hats and have a second home when we need to off the grid.
[3:10:29] dutchie76: hope its like Wildstar housing
[3:10:34] aminus: player housing but you can only put up 1 plank of your hut per week

[3:12:51] Karail_Lyoona: I want a new mail class that can tank
[3:12:54] lithium364: housing would need its own team, if they wanna make enough content for it

[4:56:10] CritcobainTV: @91Niki Don't forget the grandparents
[4:56:18] 2MakeMe: they're more afraid of the korean neitizens if they fuk up
[4:56:28] Kneckt: their collab with coldplay is helping epxose them even more to the west

[4:57:36] PvtHudson093: just revamp the talents that no one uses
[4:57:41] 91Niki: With the fame and the control around them, I'd be surprised if those kids don't have a Britney scale breakdown at some point
[4:57:55] ElPolloBatman: new talent system: just like in hearthstone you buy booster packs! there's a chance to contain rare, epic and legendary versions of talents!
[4:57:56] gali5656: DT is sick
[4:57:58] NA_Mus: so next expansion we going down to 50 again or we leveling to 70?
[4:57:58] PvtHudson093: I really want to keep DT for Ret
[4:58:02] Xsilentghost: Thats not enough, Theres to many talents that we take 100% of the time and they need to be baseline
[4:58:07] 91Niki: Can't be a healthy lifestyle
[4:58:21] LawzenzOfficial: how about adding a new talent to each row? :D
[4:58:22] jridablo: they should do a Lost ark talent tree, i like how LA do it
[4:58:41] gali5656: i could see abom limb becoming baseline
[4:58:50] Clicklesly: It's more about making the bad talents viable rather than useless i guess
[4:59:03] Gurtogg: its been 8 years since we got a new talent row lol
[4:59:04] falldrgn: if we get any talent re works it will be the leggos from this xpac baked  into new\current abilities
[4:59:08] 2MakeMe: and im saying i want those 40+ talents
[4:59:10] MetalJoshP: Maybe make it where we can choose not to use a row and double in another row?
[4:59:16] metavahn231: its nice to experiment and use fringe builds
[4:59:21] Armdel: same old, look up what the good players are using and copy that
[4:59:23] CritcobainTV: There's always gonna be a best for min maxxers
[4:59:26] cdk058: but i still rather have the old talent system then this
[4:59:41] Rudric_Ice: @jridablo  ye I know about that shit lol even if u can sing and look like a frog u ain't making it that's one of the reasons I hate kpop stuff
[4:59:46] cryft: the opportunity to specialize into run speed or mana regen instead of, say, raw aoe healing, was an important choice
[5:00:00] cryft: and fine grain talents let you do that in interesting ways
[5:00:07] gali5656: there was always a best with those talents
[5:00:18] cryft: now its 2000 mp5 for everyone all the time 🤡
[5:00:38] lithium364: Bonestorm undertuned since Bfa Sadge
[5:00:48] LawnSpeaker: @Towelliee it's mostly cool while levelling a character, the old talent system was way better for that
[5:00:54] Captain_nShaneO: *searches the google for "best build for monk for pve and pvp".... "uninstall"... oh... Sadge
[5:00:55] 2MakeMe: but the thing is, its the illusion of choice, but they took away choice
[5:01:00] Mippens: I customised a lot with talents tbh. Tried different playstyles and builds. And like the idea of dipping into anothjer spec and deciding how far with what trade off
[5:01:16] Sayryn: Meaningful choice
[5:01:18] Rudric_Ice: pls no more borrowed power
[5:01:22] Lilamanela: people don't remember how was the MMORPGs back then, when wow came up with a system like that everyone's mind blowed it was really good back then compared to other games' systems. however, people just remember their good memories and still think old systems were better this day
[5:01:22] LawnSpeaker: @Mippens hybrid builds were cool
[5:01:35] Trombol97: sounds like soulsbinds
[5:01:35] Armdel: i switch up my talents quite a bit between dungeons and raids
[5:01:37] Jigawatts42: more borrowed power burkeSad
[5:01:40] KragnosWoW: give us 6 piece bonuses Kappa
[5:01:40] Sepron14: i kinda hope we dont have to level from 60-70 i have way too many alts at 60 now
[5:01:46] uhtred_gaming: @Towelliee what gunnars you rocking?
[5:02:14] LawnSpeaker: Exactly, the old talent system wouldn't work in the current game :(
[5:02:14] RunningOutOfRAM: it is not bugged LUL
[5:02:17] cryft: Lilamanela but people just played (or still play) classic and bc classic. especially pvp there were tons of viable builds
[5:02:19] hatsihansu: it's not bugged, the roots are just hard to see
[5:02:22] Kolepto: you pull 5 roots near him and he spawns
[5:02:28] Moobot: towBleedpurple towGold Thanks for supporting The Hammer Squad by watching these 3 minutes of commercials! towGold You also have the option to subscribe to further plant yourself in our community and no longer see ads! towUp towBleedpurple
[5:02:28] Gurtogg: people need to get out of their nostalgia bubble
[5:02:34] glory_toon: @Towelliee Add covenant abilities too a talent line which gets unlocked once you complete the story of that talent line then no new level increase just complete the story chapter too unlock the talent
[5:02:37] Aphro_Samurai: towel gluttonous works now. you just haveto pull 5 roots. click him on your map itll show you where they are @Towelliee
[5:02:38] Dagomarus: I spawned him once, the roots are hard to see af
[5:02:47] cdk058: its not nostalgy for me i think is better
[5:02:57] cdk058: sorry english
[5:02:58] CritcobainTV: I'm going black dragonflight so i can make BBD jokes. Big Black Dragons
[5:02:59] TheCliffyShow: Hi, everybody!
[5:03:15] RunningOutOfRAM: !9to5
[5:03:15] Moobot: @RunningOutOfRAM https://twitter.com/towelthetank/status/1513389858378567681 - PHASE 1 of 9 TO 5 CHALLENGE
[5:03:25] rutari: you think the aspects will go to role? green for resto, red/blue for dps, black for tank?
[5:03:27] Lilamanela: @cryft yes but most of the talents you can choose from the old talent tree are not even usable for most classes if you want to enjoy your class
[5:03:49] LawnSpeaker: @Towelliee paragon systems just aren't as satisfying though... what if they just make levelling a bigger part of the game again
[5:03:53] TheCliffyShow: @Critcobain I can't think of a better reason to go black dragons.
[5:04:17] MarquisLek: ever since they did the level scaling in bfa , levelling became pointless
[5:04:19] mmrghost7: old talent could be added on top of this
[5:04:21] Jigawatts42: Illusion of Choice burkeRave burkeRave
[5:04:25] TheCliffyShow: Wasn't the old talent trees mostly filled with generic stat boosts and stuff?
[5:04:27] CritcobainTV: @Towelliee the only thing i like about the old system is that there was some pretty cool things u could do for farming, but when it came to raiding it was all cookie cutter
[5:04:29] Cafe0le: fuck levelling, jsut remove that shot from the game finally
[5:04:39] Xsilentghost: What if the old talent system was combined with todays talent system, but actually have good impactful minor bonues and maybe a good ability at the end, Like look at borderlands skill trees
[5:04:48] PvtHudson093: All i was saying that in the current talent system that there are some dead talents that need replacing or changing
[5:05:00] 2MakeMe: i want to be VIABLE FeelsBadMan
[5:05:05] itsbananas01: BabyRage What class should I play?
[5:05:08] Lilamanela: @cryft Despite having so many choices, at the end of the day most people gonna choose their talents after they check wowhead's  or icyveins bis talent tree
[5:05:20] lithium364: just give me Drust spells for my druid
[5:06:11] NewWorldReign: Alexstrazse being a major character in Dragonflight?
[5:06:27] TheCliffyShow: From what I remember, the old talent trees weren't that much more interseting. Just bigger. They were filled with a bunch of generic stat boosts and stuff.
[5:06:35] uhtred_gaming: @Towelliee a few of my guildies have told me that Blood dk are the strongest dps tanks in high keys.  high keys being 25 and higher, do you agree or do you think paladins are stronger?
[5:06:35] Moobot: Towelliee is sponsored by GFUEL! The official energy drink of ESPORTS and THE HAMMER SQUAD! Use code TOWEL at checkout! http://gfuel.ly/3kf8stb
[5:06:35] Psmurf504: I haven't played since last July. is it worth getting into now, or should I wait until then new expansion?
[5:06:38] Mippens: Aspect Power
[5:06:40] NewWorldReign: They dont have their powers anymore, remember DS ending?
[5:06:46] CritcobainTV: Time to collect some Dragon Juice Kreygasm
[5:06:52] Captain_nShaneO: @TheCliffyShow yep.... people still searched for the "best" builds anyways
[5:06:58] Mippens: @Critcobain Dubious
[5:07:07] mmrghost7: nah i want to level up
[5:07:08] MarquisLek: aspect exp
[5:07:11] itsbananas01: LUL AP it will be!
[5:07:12] NewWorldReign: The dragons dont have their powers anymore @Towelliee remember DS ending?
[5:07:22] TheCliffyShow: @NewWorldReign According to that leaked promo art, she is. Even if that's fake. She probably will be anyway.
[5:07:22] xhaven: @Critcobain lol didnt even think of that!
[5:07:30] lithium364: i think the Story will revolve around 2 dragons 1 who fell in love with an mortal, the other seeking revenge against mortals, the cinematic will open with an guy walking towards an snowy castle
[5:07:30] Gurtogg: anima is nothing like AP
[5:07:30] NA_Mus: so how would we level up the green dragonflight if theres no aspect now :(
[5:07:31] Eithos87: squished back down to 50 and lvl to 60 in new xpac
[5:07:33] lithium364: Kappa
[5:07:37] NA_Mus: I love green dragons
[5:07:38] Dark_lite7: i'd welcome a no leveling expansion, just earn endgame stuff straight away
[5:07:54] TheCliffyShow: @Captain_nShaneO I remember going to Elitist Jerks and copying them.
[5:08:01] Mippens: e-mortality?

[5:14:26] itsbananas01: POGGERS Dragonborn class?
[5:14:55] danimoto10: confirmed no new class in 10.0
[5:15:01] rutari: i dont think we will get any more new classes somehow
[5:15:10] Thoreya: Sadge
[5:15:13] Mippens: A bard would be cool
[5:15:14] TheCliffyShow: I want a new class because it's new. And, a like new things.
[5:15:15] jridablo: i think it will, specially if its dragon base class lol everyone been asking for that since forever
[5:15:16] CritcobainTV: Well that's where your wrong. I saw the leaks and we're definitely getting Super Mecha tinker dragonlancers. @Towelliee
[5:15:19] itsbananas01: LUL Imagine the tuning team when Ion comes in and say "Okay, so, we'll add another class in 10.0!"
[5:15:22] Nazkol: need more balancing between classes before a new class tbh!
[5:15:30] mizuwaer: it would be so much healthier for the game if there was a roadmap
[5:15:32] Armdel: people seem to think just adding new class is easy and blizz are just lazy
[5:15:33] TheAbraxas94: i'd rather they invest the time into existing classes
[5:15:40] Thunderbrew: Blizzard needs focus on getting the expansion right. Can't make it to complicated right now
[5:15:47] CritcobainTV: Dr Robotnik PogChamp
[5:15:47] Kirof2102: @Towelliee but are new classes not fundamental for WoW?
[5:15:48] Captain_nShaneO: @TheAbraxas94 fax
[5:15:49] LorienV: @towelliee Tinker tank spec
[5:15:54] lithium364: its def an cool theme
[5:16:13] masenka_: Good content is what wow needs
[5:16:23] NewWorldReign: Well, after SL clusterfuck start Blizzard needs something big to make us forget
[5:16:23] Wheeellz: wow needs more ranged classes
[5:16:23] Handsomewalnut: im fine with no new classes personally
[5:16:24] MarquisLek: i just want shamans to be able to tank
[5:16:32] EmpathyLiveChat: Personally I'm happy without a new class
[5:16:40] Korupcija_: they should remove a class in 10.0"
[5:16:49] itsbananas01: POGGERS Add a new spec to every class!
[5:16:53] Kirof2102: @Towelliee maybe rework classes we have? like meele mange or something like that?
[5:17:06] Mippens: Tinker / Bard / Spellbreaker are things I can see hapening with a nice story to go along
[5:17:10] Korupcija_: world quests did a good job but that was like 15 years ago
[5:17:12] NewWorldReign: They'll probably do a guild thing, but with Green Dragonflight etc n next expansion
[5:17:17] lithium364: class skins unlocking via an new version of mage tower
[5:17:20] gali5656: yeah remove demon hunters 10.0
[5:17:24] CritcobainTV: True
[5:17:25] skeletorsyourdad: the world was interesting
[5:17:27] Zettabyte: kill 10 rats Kappa

[5:17:36] Cafe0le: nah just give me a new class to enjoy the content i already like
[5:17:44] CritcobainTV: Jokes on you, I'm still a virgin
[5:17:49] Captain_nShaneO: make us born again virgins blizzard BibleThump
[5:17:54] king_julian_96: So towelliee if square enix doesn’t realese the new ultimate fight for ffxiv tomorrow with 6.1 when do you think we will get the new ultimate fight in ffxiv then
[5:17:58] xhaven: wierdly I liked the world quests in bfa and legion a ton more than shadowlands

[5:18:06] falldrgn: I want to feel invested in the story and characters.. like the  Val'sharah thats a tear jerker
[5:18:06] skeletorsyourdad: they have made the zones more gamey
[5:18:13] cryft: interesting world is killed by effortless travel. zones dont mean anything because you're not stuck there, relying on the local npc infrastructure
[5:18:25] mmrghost7: they should make a melee class using voidpowers
[5:18:29] net_mi: I heared there is going to be 4 classes of single spec instead of one class with 4 specs. What's your thought about single specs?
[5:18:30] cryft: gadgetzan was cool because it had an auction house, but bronto mount means there's one everywhere
[5:18:30] pannkakewow: new class: Dragoon
[5:18:35] Mippens: flying ruined wow though
[5:18:36] itsbananas01: LUL Another melee
[5:18:42] ryan_poe: Dailies do not give you Enlightened Rep right?
[5:18:45] Kneckt: same tbh
[5:18:45] chiefiskeith: Playing WoW for the first time was prolly the greatest gaming experience of my life
[5:18:46] glory_toon: increase map saize add more random mountain dungeons containing treasures/mounts/transmogs but on a repeatable spawn changing locations medium in length
[5:18:46] Armdel: another leather melee
[5:18:48] zigzugg: another melee moon2SUFFER
[5:18:50] Kneckt: dont need another fkin hunter
[5:18:56] Blastojunior: DK with a bow XD
[5:19:00] Captain_nShaneO: i feel like they'd add new specs to existing classes before a new class right now
[5:19:01] szble: true
[5:19:09] PvtHudson093: Mail wearing Tank/Dps is what we need
[5:19:16] kimmo_gaming: @Towelliee If its a class then it should be a mail class, that has a tank spec imo
[5:19:18] skeletorsyourdad: dragon class..no need for flying mounts
[5:19:19] falldrgn: @mmrghost7 They would be the old Demo lock iirc
[5:19:20] LorienV: give me undead paladins
[5:19:21] Dark_lite7: everyone's wish list is so crazy right now, whatever they announce will still disappoint a fair percentage of people LUL

[5:19:23] CritcobainTV: KEKW
[5:19:25] TheCliffyShow: Don't listen to Towelliee, Blizzard. Give us Dark Rangers.
[5:19:39] MetaalMeneer: 4th warlock healer spec
[5:19:40] Captain_nShaneO: let every class do everything BibleThump it's not fair that druids get everything
[5:19:47] net_mi: 4 classes with single spec each
[5:19:48] StickyTreez: Mail wearing tinker class that can tank/dps/heal
[5:19:51] itsbananas01: What about you can choose a secondary class LUL
[5:19:58] VrtniPatuljak: no new class, no improved world. price increased to $60 gg ez KEKW
[5:19:58] Thunderbrew: Just make WoW better, forget about a new class
[5:20:01] Einzbern: just give each class a spec for something they don't already have, imo. Mage heals, warlock tanks, etc
[5:20:01] falldrgn: Warden would be cool. They are already in the game.
[5:20:07] Captain_nShaneO: @itsbananas01 30g to respec
[5:20:18] bobby_knock: A witch ranger :p
[5:20:19] Gurtogg: arent dark rangers just red eyed blood elf huntards?
[5:20:20] Henke1983: dont't mind a new class as long as it's not tinker, that sounds lame
[5:20:21] Blastojunior: @Captain_nShaneO This sentence has been said for 17 years. lmao
[5:20:26] itsbananas01: I mean, you get a few spells or perks of another class
[5:20:27] skeletorsyourdad: shadowlands should have been a reset
[5:20:36] king_julian_96: What about tinkers and necromancers though towelliee I wouldn’t mind playing either of those 2 classes
[5:20:38] Sielu11628: Towelliee already "knows what he knows." Will be fun for everyone to know in 8 days, though!
[5:20:39] oraclespyro: i want a  bard in wow
[5:20:43] PvtHudson093: Paladin Caster DPS
[5:20:45] KaisenSiru: Hell no!

[5:20:51] Mippens: battlestandard Healer warrior. Lets go! Healing shout!
[5:20:58] Captain_nShaneO: that's why i play monk.. can do anything... *cries in monk*
[5:21:01] MrFuzzynuts420: ayo warriors got some phat heals! KEKW
[5:21:04] Saphirosa_Dragonaspect: I rather would like no races and no restrictions on class/race combos
[5:21:06] LorienV: bards with guitars like etc would be dope
[5:21:09] Korupcija_: demo warlock that heals with pets PogChamp
[5:21:13] Saphirosa_Dragonaspect: more new races*
[5:21:24] Captain_nShaneO: idk why this game just doesn't press the buttons for me so i can top the charts in my raid
[5:21:24] Tauren0309: That sound like GW2 hunters as healers
[5:21:37] Kneckt: that would be fuckin bonkers
[5:21:38] lithium364: why not both? its their job, such a lazy argument from the community to say new class= rest of content bad or vice versa
[5:21:41] romere_db: I want a warrior tank, that calls upon holy power to  heal himself while using necromancy to slowly suck the life out of his foes

[5:23:50] king_julian_96: What about tinkers and necromancers though towelliee I personally wouldn’t playing either of those 2 classes in next expac
[5:23:55] szble: they would have to pump out new lore for it
[5:23:57] Fortuitas: I dont care about a new class, just give me account wide and cross faction everything
[5:24:02] garkhyt: when you are in dragon form you got different action bar same as rogue when on stealth :)
[5:24:17] NewWorldReign: Dragon form should be a thing in Dragonflight.
[5:24:36] LorienV: The fact is new classes and races sell boxes. more of this same content ain't bringing anyone back
[5:24:59] romere_db: Didn'

[5:25:50] Uguntinsh: Dragonflight new class from Dragonball Z, Goku - Kamekamekaaaaaaa blast special.
[5:25:55] Cafe0le: tinker is a much better idea than dark ranger or dragonsworn, not even close
[5:26:09] mizuwaer: @Towelliee i just hope we will get flying early on its just so annoying to grind out flying just give it after 2 weeks for 10k gold and lets go
[5:26:12] xhaven: shadowlands wasnt bad at start however the leveling and that begining patch was good it was the delays after

[5:27:08] PvtHudson093: Habit
[5:27:17] Clicklesly: Surely that's just cause WoW is combined with Classic numbers Kappa
[5:27:18] Gurtogg: 9.1.5 and 9.2 are good patches
[5:27:21] Heyhowsitgoingtonight: I've played it too long to just quit
[5:27:21] Joryckfree: @TheKenzCz completely true
[5:27:24] masenka_: the people that hate wow are very vocal - the people that like it are quiet and keep playing
[5:27:29] KaisenSiru: I play it because it is fun
[5:27:34] LorienV: @towelliee true, but wow is in a position it's never been before. They're in second place. (minus classic) they need something fresh.

[5:28:48] Heyhowsitgoingtonight: 10 years
[5:28:49] Heyhowsitgoingtonight: dang
[5:28:52] szble: yeah they grew for sure but still not close
[5:28:55] ispyyro: All the WoW hate is in Asmon's chat
[5:28:55] MarquisLek: i wish ffxiv was a regular jrpg then an mmo

[5:29:23] Heyhowsitgoingtonight: 1 year
[5:29:25] Heyhowsitgoingtonight: dang
[5:29:29] Sovekz: Almost all the people I know went back to WoW from FF14
[5:29:31] Joryckfree: FF is to be honest just a game that  lacks animations and voice acting in very crappy overhyped story
[5:29:36] bobby_knock: I stop playing wow after 16 years because i focus on other things not becouse of the game
[5:29:55] CritcobainTV: People say WoW isn't a dominant mmo but i dont see anyting else making the kind of money or having the number of players that wow has, even in its bad times
[5:30:01] Scorpionlaw: Sorry was putting on socks, I have been playing since the beginning. I have had carpul tunnel surgery on both hands. I cant do the raiding/mythic dungeons. So I collect stuff..mounts and mog
[5:30:06] skittleguzzler: the people that said FFXIV was #1 used that dumb mmopopulation website....not good info on there tbh
[5:30:12] mavericks312: I always seen ff14 as a glorified single player game with grouping content
[5:30:23] CritcobainTV: unless you're alliance KEKW
[5:30:25] LorienV: @towelliee they're at almost 2 mill concurrent logins I believe. you think retail has that? I play both BTW.
[5:30:40] szble: wow could make way more money too
[5:30:45] Captain_nShaneO: people will always come back to wow for the most part
[5:30:50] Sramton: It'll be that way literally till the game is shut down... 50 years from now, and we're battling worms from planet klatu that appeared from the mists, and overtook the void.
[5:30:54] MrFuzzynuts420: New World is down bad
[5:30:55] Korupcija_: no alliance will join my group SMOrc
[5:30:58] net_mi: wow subs are going to exceed wotlk era when blizz implements proper player-housing
[5:31:03] TheCliffyShow: 9.2.5 will be the second coming of the Alliance.
[5:31:07] king_julian_96: The problem is they don’t link active subs for both games so you can’t really tell who has more subs till they link it wow probably does have more subs then ffxiv right now but we can’t really tell until they link us sum subs
[5:31:22] MetaalMeneer: will you go alliance when there is cross faction play?
[5:31:27] CritcobainTV: I can't wait for cross faction raiding. I'm literally going to spend the entire raid punting and teabagging gnomes KEKW
[5:31:31] MarquisLek: shaman tanking

[5:31:55] king_julian_96: dk healing mayeb to
[5:32:05] szble: erp housing Kappa
[5:32:10] TheCliffyShow: If they add Player Housing and High Elves, I will never quit WoW again.
[5:32:13] snake_like: 2 months into expansion: tomatoAngry why new hub dead. blissard force me into me house
[5:32:14] Zucchey: I don't get what's the deal with housing in wow, why not just play sims4? :D
[5:32:17] Zligodpoe: I think blizz is still capable to deliver the good game (I hope)
[5:32:18] Heyhowsitgoingtonight: they're doing it confirmed by towelliee
[5:32:19] NickFPV: @Towelliee What if instead of a new class they slowly add more specs to the game. Like 2 new specs per expac.
[5:32:21] LorienV: bro housing is fucking lit. we have so many in game assets we can use.
[5:32:22] Ravoric: Guild Halls
[5:32:22] gali5656: with a dragon mama
[5:32:23] Captain_nShaneO: idk why they wouldn't... $$$ for the store... oh.. here's a sparkly chair.. 10 dollars please

[5:32:35] mavericks312: never got the housing hype
[5:32:37] szble: yes please dragon mamas
[5:32:42] Saphirosa_Dragonaspect: @Captain_nShaneO you mean like ff does with the cooler stuff
[5:32:43] Korupcija_: it needs as much customization as transmog though
[5:32:49] campingking615: HI
[5:32:56] akia03: the old mmo horizon ha housing and also playable dragons with there own lair
[5:32:58] CritcobainTV: I feel like housing is so fucking bad for wow though. WoW already struggles to keep people out in the world
[5:32:58] kenzincrafts: so true @Korupcija_
[5:33:02] Thoreya: I just want some crazy shit for 10.0
[5:33:04] cryft: player housing worthless if instanced. wow just isnt the game for it
[5:33:12] Thoreya: Some revolutionary shit like me legion
[5:33:12] Sielu11628: Train your dragon. Rests atop your player housing and can be see from outside.
[5:33:19] dianthusnemo: customizable housing in our Garriosns :D  houses for each player but Garrson guildshared :D <3
[5:33:24] bvbdragon: all i hope for is a new class, dont think i would even play an expansion without one or more like the 1spec stuff
[5:33:27] Gurtogg: just make garrisons relevant again
[5:33:28] hartzzzz: We will get given a dragon egg
[5:33:29] LorienV: @towelliee stop, don't give them ideas damn it

[5:33:34] Captain_nShaneO: log in one day and your house is just destroyed LUL
[5:33:35] TheCliffyShow: My top two wanted features for WoW: Player Housing and High Elves.

[5:34:12] Captain_nShaneO: RAF bonus: let your friend hang out at your house!
[5:34:12] szble: the store could be expanded alot
[5:34:31] WeinerMcCheese: for 20$
[5:34:32] uhtred_gaming: @Towelliee some of my guildies say that blood dks are the strongest tanks in keys 25+  would you agree or would you say paladins are stronger?
[5:34:34] Captain_nShaneO: O_O
[5:34:37] net_mi: selling houses on the market
[5:34:37] king_julian_96: technially if you want to get technical we had housing in wod remember garrions in wod

[5:36:11] lithium364: orc and human house and thats it
[5:36:15] cryft: wow housing was called garrisons and everyone hated it
[5:36:17] Thoreya: LUL
[5:36:33] NickFPV: @cryft No that was not housing
[5:36:38] Dagomarus: Im a blood dk and i don’t have 4 set yet and my heart breaks everytime someone says how broken it is… like by the time i get it its gonna be nerfed to shit
[5:36:41] Armdel: knowing blizz they would drop it after the expansion lol

[5:36:50] kenzincrafts: people love showing off too xD you knoww
[5:37:01] LorienV: @cryft bro that wasn't housing. zero freedom of choice
[5:37:11] Xsilentghost: They would need like 20 locations to choose from though for housing for it to feel unique
[5:37:13] net_mi: They could tie in a new profession to house building
[5:37:15] CritcobainTV: I'm for real tho, imma sell Fadeleaf, Felweed, Ghost mushrooms. Whatever u need I got you.
[5:37:18] kenzincrafts: yeaaa i think so too
[5:37:32] MrFuzzynuts420: what ever happened to new world?
[5:37:38] cryft: @LorienV you didnt put the flowers on the wall yourself, but you picked decorations, trophies, useful installations, filled it with npcs you liked
[5:37:42] Sovekz: Hope they do add housing so I can show off the worst house ever, cluttered with the most useless shit in it

[5:42:16] TheCliffyShow: Account-wide banks
[5:42:16] Mippens: Classes
[5:42:22] Handsomewalnut: reputation, currencies, everythinggg
[5:42:22] Korupcija_: if they didn't do acc wide for 9.2 systems they won't for 10.0
[5:42:23] masenka_: word
[5:42:29] Eithos87: I'd be happy if rep was account wide
[5:42:29] Armdel: having every piece of content give you AP to level your neck and wep definitely made me play more
[5:42:30] its_fenris: like Gul'dan "everything"?
[5:42:34] Juvis: yes! that!

[5:44:02] Heyhowsitgoingtonight: You think Frank Gore is a 1st ballot Hall of Famer? @Towelliee
[5:44:04] Mippens: everything? Account wide talents ;)
[5:44:13] danimoto10: they musttt do the lost ark method
[5:44:15] Escalprillo: Heresy towelliee! that could never happen!
[5:44:16] t_a_t_s_u_r_o: yes please Blizzard.
[5:44:31] mikhaeld277: would be really cool
[5:44:38] Eregbueye: Id love that
[5:44:40] murazzond: @Lothlend People play horde for a reason. we don't really care about looks only.
[5:44:41] DiiscoViking: or at least a vendor to xfer like anima
[5:44:41] Birder_L: maybe in the last patch lol
[5:44:48] Anneris1: I want to use pandaria portals from other character Sadge
[5:44:50] Juvis: Perfect world! Imo possible. Blizz what are you waiting for? ^_^
[5:45:03] akia03: arnt you just forced to have a bunch of alts than
[5:45:08] CritcobainTV: @Baleroc1 that's not even close to what was said
[5:45:09] jairogue: @DiiscoViking There actually is a vendor like that in Oribos next to flymaster
[5:45:12] Fortuitas: account wide and cross faction everything from the start
[5:45:14] Thunderbrew: FF!4 pretty much does that.
[5:45:18] szble: best they can do is 10.2.5
[5:45:19] jpopei: wanna build a pc like towelies, anyoen can help me what his specs are
[5:45:22] jridablo: yeah thats a better way for alt catch up than what they have right now
[5:45:26] MarquisLek: valor will still have a timegated max
[5:45:33] 7r4v3L: Ion @ best I can do is half on what you just said, in 10.3.5
[5:45:33] DiiscoViking: @jairogue for valor??
[5:45:40] lithium364: i fear they will never do that for their stupid player retention metric
[5:45:48] cryft: you should have to play a character to progress it and gear it
[5:45:58] jairogue: @DiiscoViking Oh I tought you were asking about anima
[5:46:05] CritcobainTV: Sorry, best i can do is a patch with a Selfie Camera.
[5:46:31] Thunderbrew: WoW has slowed the game down to keep you playing since Classic
[5:46:31] murazzond: so much focus on metrics
[5:46:37] DiiscoViking: @jairogue I was using the anima vendor as example, all good

[5:46:50] Reckless_Monk: they should just go all out, make everything account wide, stop gate keeping and time gateing for 1 expac and see how it goes
[5:46:56] cryft: playing main to gear alts is the most anti-mmo suggestion ever
[5:46:58] Reckless_Monk: and not be fearful
[5:47:03] lithium364: Ion is busy finding the mathematic formula for fun
[5:47:04] Birder_L: so much stuff in SL appears to be designed to slow people down, untill the last patch
[5:47:12] CritcobainTV: @Baleroc1 he said he wants it account wide. Which means it's shared. So if you farm it on your main, you dont have to farm it on every undergeared alt you have.
[5:47:13] Birder_L: ive noticed it more than in prev exps
[5:47:13] VrtniPatuljak: wait...you can just make a good game? 4Head
[5:47:21] Korupcija_: they're too strict on fun
[5:47:22] jridablo: i wish the story quest is account wide
[5:47:23] Fortuitas: yes yes absolutely correct
[5:47:37] Crowzcut: and will own it 56  senators said they vote yes

[5:48:15] lithium364: its an diversion from the NFTs coming in 10.0 Kappa
[5:48:24] oraclespyro: account wide reputation is amother thing i want
[5:48:26] Korupcija_: I'll believe it when they remove power infusion LUL
[5:48:27] jones9: Make currency account wide to start. All new currency is uncapped from the start not something that sits in our bags
[5:48:31] Fortuitas: the game actively discourages you from playing alts... what sort of game discourages you from playing  it????
[5:48:47] CritcobainTV: @Baleroc1 ... You don't grasp the concept of account wide i suppose
[5:48:50] Just_Jaybles: i hate grinding rep on alts, wish once you got exalted on your main, you could buy like a medal or something from the vendor you can send to an alt and its like "ahh you are a friend of (mains name) he is trusted and proven himself, you are also welcome" or something and it gets your straight to revered or something
[5:49:02] TheCliffyShow: 20 dungeons! And, have all of them be 2 hours long.
[5:49:06] Shirey36: we need less rp in dungeons for m+
[5:49:06] jridablo: 5 the best we can do sorry - blizz
[5:49:14] cryft: Fortuitas are you stoned? there is so much alt friendliness taking hours of play time away from people who like investing in alts
[5:49:32] kimmo_gaming: @Towelliee Make it like TBC, 20 dungeons LOL
[5:49:39] QuigsTV: @Towelliee idk if its an unpopular opinion but i really like the megadungeons they add

[5:50:16] akia03: 5 dungeons 2 raids at launch seems nicer
[5:50:21] JackedDown: Baby steps
[5:50:23] ispyyro: Do you think WoW would benefit from a Mentor system for new players going through first time dungeons? At the moment it seems like a race skipping all the ads on the way.
[5:50:23] NickFPV: 10 but maybe rotate one or two each season
[5:50:25] kimmo_gaming: Because of the M+ yes, 10-12 max
[5:50:28] Qargory: 10 from release, 8 seemed not quite enough

[5:50:37] mavericks312: having to key +15s would be tedious for 20 dungeons
[5:50:49] CritcobainTV: @Baleroc1 Okay. Let me explain. There's still going to be a weekly cap for valor, but when you don't need to upgrade things on one character, you can use that valor that you have on your main to upgrade gear on your alts.
[5:51:05] CritcobainTV: instead of that valor sitting there wasted
[5:51:09] senseofpurpose90: THEY SOULD PUT  a CAP ON MYTHIC +, no one wants to farm forever, let us clear the game
[5:51:10] Korupcija_: WTF Pog
[5:51:24] JackedDown: Wasp
[5:51:24] Korupcija_: you're getting so many rare stuff today!
[5:51:26] akia03: wasp
[5:51:26] 3663Sharad: Yep its ab bee
[5:51:27] Mippens: its a lightyear
[5:51:29] 3663Sharad: or honet
[5:51:32] 3663Sharad: *hornet
[5:51:33] Mozzeyy_: Looks like ARPG
[5:51:34] TheCliffyShow: But, Towelliee, You're a WoW player. You're suppose to ask for unreason stuff then get mad when you don't get it.

[5:51:48] NickFPV: @senseofpurpose90 uhh pushing is part of the fun?
[5:51:49] senseofpurpose90: they should do max MYTHIHC + 20
[5:51:52] senseofpurpose90: And finish
[5:51:56] akia03: they increased the droprates when they added the pocopoc custimisation

[5:52:43] Gurtogg: Pog
[5:52:43] CritcobainTV: @Baleroc1 Okay bro. I'm done with the conversation. lmao. You obviously don't get how the system would work and it's a waste of time
[5:52:45] Eregbueye: Cool
[5:52:50] QuigsTV: @senseofpurpose90 i disagree. Why put a max on keys you kill the 1% players. it probably doesnt affect you
[5:53:11] Korupcija_: they're waiting for 9.2.5
[5:53:14] Korupcija_: for no reason
[5:53:29] szble: cant be that clueless yeah
[5:53:42] lithium364: busy working on 10.0 soulbinds
[5:53:53] raye_gaming22: cuz they dont want ppl to get better gear keep ppl grinding and subed
[5:53:54] Mippens: it's currency gating and it's what blizz has done for ages
[5:53:57] KragnosWoW: just let me one shot everything Kappa
[5:54:02] MrFuzzynuts420: cuz fun detected!
[5:54:04] ZakuzaGB: i feel like this CAP on valor is  the same as conquest nad they probably see it as us been so early in the season
[5:54:05] Glialka: Because the only reason they keep a playerbase is because their loot system is fucked and it takes to long to get a decent set of gear. Its the only thing they can hold on to right now imo.
[5:54:06] Specsifier: it shouldn't have mattered in the first place pattyShrug
[5:54:12] immortallistv: Warhanius subscribed with Prime. 
[5:54:13] CritcobainTV: Give me the 007 golden gun and i'll be happy. 1 shot kills on everything
[5:54:13] Mippens: And it does matter, since without a valor cap you'd get tier AND max itemlevel
[5:54:17] reggiepowa: uncapped valor would kinda kill heroic raid loot
[5:54:18] Shirey36: what raid dificulty with the catalyst resemble for xmog?
[5:54:19] KaisenSiru: They don't want you in full 272 M+ gear in the raid raid. Horde HoF has yet to be filled
[5:54:29] Aquadriel: i hope it ends up NOT being dragonflight so community fucking implodes KEKW
[5:54:33] DegenerateHaven: wait till next xpac. Here slayer of gods and titans go kill 10 boars

[5:56:44] Armdel: there are other wasps that are arguably easier to craft i think
[5:56:49] Specsifier: WoW is the only MMO on the market where account progress isn't account wide chat. This game is dated

[5:58:06] reggiepowa: so materials are rare drops but you also need to farm motes to get a mount
[5:58:21] Aquadriel: didnt they mean hentai foundry? Kreygasm
[5:58:21] gali5656: I think thats where the creation catalyst is at
[5:58:23] reggiepowa: and recipes

[6:10:05] pereadin: I have found a new guild maybe(?)
[6:10:14] CritcobainTV: @Specsifier WeirdChamp

[6:11:20] TheCliffyShow: I got mine the hard way.
[6:12:00] Aquadriel: they should delay it to 9.2.5
[6:12:10] classicfluffy: @Specsifier you should try keys with some friends, it's great when you get into it :)
[6:12:15] pereadin: I feel like they should have given it day 1 but made the stuff extremely expensive and reduced the cost over time.
[6:12:21] darksoreno: get the chest here
[6:12:22] Aquadriel: KEKW
[6:12:28] MrFuzzynuts420: LUL
[6:12:28] pereadin: Would have given us a reason to farm cosmic flux and not have so much piled up already
[6:12:30] Specsifier: that would mean my friends have kept playing the game KEKW @classicfluffy
[6:12:37] Heyhowsitgoingtonight: @DiiscoViking 300 which most ev's have these days is enough to drive for about 5 hours, average daily commutes are less than 40 miles a day

[6:44:08] LawnSpeaker: @Heyhowsitgoingtonight if you only consider gaming

[7:40:36] TheCheeseWheel87: Imagine this: Nathanos on the run back to Ice Crown to rally the scourge. He's distraught and pulls out a picture of Sylvanas as a tear runs down his cheek. Scene cuts to the Sylvanas in the maw..... Shes coming back to be with the simp of all simps.
[7:40:40] readyvic: box art already leeked :)
[7:40:42] Gruffian: Alex or Wrathion, longshots for Ysera or Kalecgos

[7:40:54] HaxzorJimDuggan: someone needs to punch wrathion in the mouth again
[7:40:55] tydrennistv: So if blizzard is following this pattern and now we’re getting Cata 2.0 for 10.0 are we getting mop 2.0 In 11.0?
[7:40:55] TheCliffyShow: Well, to be fair, Kael'thas just looks like a generic blood elf.
[7:40:57] TigbittiesXXL: what is your number 1 want for the next xpac? a must have. @Towelliee
[7:40:59] mavericks312: that could be a loading screen

[7:45:38] Endin: ZM literally is a 5 minute daily login for a ittle rep
[7:45:38] dracullus: oh these terrible grinds in SL, how we will survive another expac like that, we will grind ourselves to death
[7:45:41] warrenny: @iloveyalun Yes you can
[7:45:41] Korupcija_: we need world quests 2.0 but for real this time
[7:45:44] Milanesa_De_Pollo: Will the new class start at level 1? or be like DH/DK?
[7:45:46] crescentdh: ive never understood why people dislike grinding in WoW as long as it's good, that's literally the reason i still play
[7:45:50] throwawaym3: @warrenny thanks bud

[7:46:03] Tokies: I hope they bring back the kill quests
[7:46:04] Coriollis: I mean weren't the aspects created by the Titans the ones from Argus ? so like yeah maybe it will start with dragons but end with something bigger
[7:46:05] throwawaym3: @Eregbueye Ty
[7:46:05] skeletorsyourdad: blizzard arent going to change the formula

[7:46:44] TheCliffyShow: Here's an interesting question, will we see Aszhara in Dragon Isles? Could that true seat of power be in Dragon Isles?
[7:46:45] HaxzorJimDuggan: i just like having time to play other games and not feel like im being left behind by not grinding WoW
[7:46:53] throwawaym3: Unpopular opinion: I liked BFA
[7:46:56] vanillahobbit: bfa really suffered from not having acc wide stuff
[7:47:02] snake_like: corruptions could have been amazing, but they went too hard on the RNG and vendor rotation bullshit
[7:47:15] mavericks312: @TheCliffyShow if nzoth is there its a possibility
[7:47:17] JackedDown: Losers
[7:47:18] HaxzorJimDuggan: i work 7-5, whats this 9-5 shit
[7:47:22] Tokies: don't forget about the side chicks @Towelliee
[7:47:22] Eregbueye: 20 is still a lot tho..
[7:47:23] Malkyr: I didnt vote because I get less then 15 hours a week
[7:47:25] mrniceguy817: Need 5-10
[7:47:25] Gurtogg: shoulve added option for less than 10 hours alot of ppl comment on this
[7:47:27] cptrogers123: It's a luxury to have work from 9-5 KEKW
[7:47:27] Havoc_S1: Sounds about right
[7:47:28] c0mmander_starscream: @Towelliee that means you have to do coffee breaks and hour lunches on a 9-5 schedule
[7:47:30] Eithos87: even 4 hours a day is 28-30 hours a week
[7:47:34] warrenny: @iloveyalun Unpopular opinion im really enjoying shadowlands just got ksm s3
[7:47:43] mmo_kenna_: less than 15 for reals
[7:47:43] Kneckt: @Fille1809 right? ppl dont seem to realize that KEKW
[7:47:45] Havoc_S1: 3 to 4 hours every other night
[7:47:45] KaisenSiru: You can blame the community who complained about Korthia grind. So they created ZM with the minimum as a result of the feedback.
[7:47:53] Tokies: Side chics play wow too.
[7:48:11] Eithos87: I spend more time in wow than I do at work
[7:48:16] cptrogers123: @Kneckt yea working from 9-5 is fucking lucky man. I work 70 hours a week
[7:48:17] JackedDown: It's not a luxury when people worked hard to earn the privilage. Everyone has the chance to do it.
[7:48:26] JackedDown: That's on yall
[7:48:27] Tokies: im still griding the followers
[7:48:28] Cafe0le: nazjatar >> zereth mortis
[7:48:29] Dashuria: i honestly like ZM stuff, its a nice break

[7:49:26] mavericks312: @warrenny S-lands is the longest ive played since MoP
[7:49:32] Relic7: I hated Jorthia
[7:49:43] cptrogers123: Korthia was probably the worst added island in whole of wow's history @Towelliee
[7:49:43] Xehanort1986: Should have added Maw flying by now
[7:49:51] Eithos87: yea with it being the last zone of the xpac'
[7:49:55] PvtHudson093: Ive done shits bigger than Korthia
[7:49:58] Kindosar: 35+ 9-5 crowd LUL
[7:50:04] cptrogers123: it was dogshit
[7:50:07] mmo_kenna_: SL has been shit full stop really

[7:50:30] lithium364: "city" of secrets LUL
[7:50:30] MessyZerg: i liked korthia
[7:50:34] Greybeard_ttv: We need like 3 Suramars lol
[7:50:57] Xehanort1986: @Towelliee they should have added Maw/Korthia flying in this patch in my honest opinion
[7:51:03] snake_like: they heard people liked Timeless Isle and just kept pumping out shittier versions
[7:51:19] kharditv: borrowed power Kappa
[7:51:19] Eithos87: I want stuff to do but not overwhelmed with everything
[7:51:21] Kakotan2143: @Towelliee Do you plan to play the new ESO Expack??
[7:51:27] WundertueteGER: yea I miss legion grind Kreygasm i want legion again Pepehand
[7:51:31] jerseyfive: can you imagine how much work Suramar was monkaS
[7:51:31] mavericks312: this xpac seemed geared towards the new age gamer
[7:51:36] CriticalBuzz: why do you have so many characters across so many servers?
[7:51:41] Cafe0le: some people just want to play arena or m+not grind wqs for power
[7:51:45] valarbravoosi: first part would have been a plus if alt-catchup was decent
[7:51:49] Greybeard_ttv: Isle of Thunder and Timeless isle equal GOATs of catch up/expac zones
[7:51:50] Vaedrun: Meaningfull choices man
[7:51:56] damnbul: once I  got flying I quit
[7:51:57] cptrogers123: 10.0 really has to be the redemption, otherwise wow will be completely dead
[7:52:00] Spookyboogy1: This Xpac has NO patches and has felt like its been long as hell, time works differently in the showlands :')
[7:52:00] Aquadriel: if ripcord stayed but alts were more enjoyable, wouldntve been so awful
[7:52:06] Aquadriel: but oyu had both ripcord and shit alts KEKW
[7:52:11] throwawaym3: Why does it take blizz so long to pull rip cords? is it just because its a long processes of going through feedback?
[7:52:13] mavericks312: @Fille1809 bad take
[7:52:13] MR_WYTE: I think most recent patch was good for alts, no? I started playing exactly 4 weeks ago and am approaching 270ilvl.
[7:52:22] goofywizard: They need to make most of the zones with Isle of Thunder, Timeless Isle, with legion mixed in
[7:52:25] whisperlude: The average person isn't playing that long in a day, having grinds isn't good.
[7:52:30] cptrogers123: @mavericks312 not a take, just a fact
[7:52:34] Reckless_Monk: if they never locked away the covenants, people wouldnt be as harsh as they are on this xpac
[7:52:40] goofywizard: MoP was reallyy good because it made you explore the zones
[7:52:46] Tokies: and kill a few rares in the world. You didn't need islands.
[7:53:00] Korupcija_: as long as it's account wide :D
[7:53:04] Dogjah: Every MMO is a grind
[7:53:06] Lausten: Its an mmo after all.
[7:53:08] cptrogers123: If there is no grind, there is no reason to play a mmo really tbh
[7:53:14] JackedDown: Thank you.
[7:53:15] themadbunny275: grinds are not bad, what sucks are doing grinds with alts for certain things
[7:53:15] Tokies: Too much of a grind for a 9/5ver isn't fun. Force feeds like islands killed bfa for me.
[7:53:19] mavericks312: @Fille1809 look at this xpac ppl say its the worst yet sales numbers are hitting records
[7:53:19] Cafe0le: then when you play alts you are way less powerful, grinds are unnecesary when you have good content like wow has
[7:53:19] Xehanort1986: Hope Reputation from dungeons+tabards return :o
[7:53:21] annokev: true
[7:53:24] KaisenSiru: True
[7:53:26] ZetYokai: amen
[7:53:27] pixxelina: simple yet people don't get it
[7:53:30] hnti86: Mythic Raider light Kappa
[7:53:30] Murlock07: that's very true
[7:53:35] WoW_StandalonE: we should not make MMOs for streamers tho
[7:53:43] Dogjah: Agreed
[7:53:45] reggiepowa: agreed
[7:53:48] Alienfromger: if you dont have time mmorpg are not yours
[7:53:52] Coriollis: grinds are fine , mandatory is not, if we remember Legion at start was very raugh and it only got better when Concordance hit live and from that point it grew in one of thebest xpaks
[7:53:53] goofywizard: As i play the game, i used to agree with that statement but not anymore
[7:53:55] Eithos87: I find raids are not as rewarding as m+
[7:53:56] rybreadgg: @Towelliee considering coming back to retail, how are the catchup mechanics? quit way before flying
[7:53:59] PadidinJones: Preach it @Towelliee !!!
[7:53:59] c0mmander_starscream: MMO's were NEVER meant for casuals, i dare to hear otherwise
[7:54:01] temp3st98: I understand that in pve but not in pvp because its all about skill not actual gearing with depending on what rating you have
[7:54:03] Aquadriel: @Towelliee people want to treat wow as a Lobby game, just log in queue 2 games and log out... go play a MOBA if you want that.
[7:54:03] TheAngryPoo: These youngins just want it easy
[7:54:04] scratches16: "but I sub for the Press Button to Win Loot button!" LUL
[7:54:05] lumaday: lumaday subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 25 months! 
[7:54:06] cptrogers123: @mavericks312 yes it hit records WHEN the expansion came out. Shadowlands and BFA has been the highest drop-off for players aswell.
[7:54:08] raldrik: grinds are great. I want to feel like I have to play to keep powerful. But a grind should not be time gated. It should be gated by diminishing returns.
[7:54:19] whisperlude: It's a different philosophy for mmos. Asian mmo's tend to be more grindy.
[7:54:19] mmo_kenna_: Just buy 10 wow tokens and buy the boes instead kekw
[7:54:21] Tokies: I don't mind grinding. But I don't want force feeds. I need more then one path
[7:54:23] iamnudo: !wow
[7:54:25] Kainiee: major grinds are fine but not on alts
[7:54:25] Gluwc: I'm actually glad I quit halfway through 9.0, now I got max renown in 2 days. I cba with the time gating.

[7:54:32] goofywizard: That philsophy kind of blocks games from the majority of the gamers. Which are casuals
[7:54:32] Gruffian: Spending lots of time and effort to be more powerful, wild for that to be a controversial opinion.
[7:54:33] Molvonos: Molvonos subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 28 months! Isometric tier pieces when?
[7:54:34] themadbunny275: that's find if the degen are more powerful, who cares
[7:54:39] Kneckt: @Gluwc same
[7:54:40] Xara36: They just need to have the rest system that Lost Ark has, miss some dailies one day, get double credit the 2nd day
[7:54:44] ChroniC_ZA: I dont mind the grind i just hate the grind on 12 toons
[7:54:44] Juvis: As one of those with limited time, i agree even tho it costs me.
[7:54:45] ArcaneSyntax: @towelliee people just want this game to be FFXIV where there's content for a week every 6 months.
[7:54:47] ArericCirera: am casual - agree
[7:55:01] jones9: Literally said that about this grind. It’s not even bad but to think there’s no actual “grind” feeling in an MMO just feels bad.
[7:55:12] Tokies: What about grinding two char to get everything?
[7:55:12] Tyas_1: agreed
[7:55:13] ChroniC_ZA: YES preach this louder so blizz hears it
[7:55:17] jones9: But so many people wanted to be in and out and now they’re bored and complaining
[7:55:19] cptrogers123: @Towelliee There has to be other things than Raid, Pvp and m+
[7:55:21] Xehanort1986: @Towelliee should they bring back reputation giving tabards? Like in WotLK/Cata?
[7:55:21] taibox: Totally agree with you on that
[7:55:29] ground4isu: Agreed. I don’t mind grinds as long as I can play what ever character I want to play.
[7:55:29] Juvis: Exactly
[7:55:29] Lazermage23: Thats why they give us flying on all your alts, jeez you want your cake and eat it too
[7:55:32] c0mmander_starscream: @Towelliee  Grinding on every ALT is so 2005 meta
[7:55:39] snake_like: conduits were the laziest shit I've ever seen. hopefully they drop that hardddd
[7:55:45] Lausten: Shared stash between all characters of a faction on a server would be so nice. Im so tired of TSM mailing everything arround. ResidentSleeper
[7:55:45] Darisen: amen
[7:55:47] WundertueteGER: accountwide rep 🙏
[7:55:50] cptrogers123: @Towelliee There has to be other grindssystems components than Raid, Pvp and m+
[7:56:01] cipusanx: na, thx. if any grind is ok is the old school one where you could farm rep with a faction and have some enchants for your gear. if you have unlimited power gain from wordl content, alts are just dead.
[7:56:06] Dogjah: Im a casual player becasue I work fulltime and yes they should not make the game around my play style.... I want more and more to do. If I can do it so be it, if not it is what it is
[7:56:18] Coriollis: I get it why they would implement something to make a char primary but than again u have the token which invalidates half the game
[7:56:23] darssia_: i’m getting account wide essences ptsd
[7:56:28] byrdeen45: rep should me account wide
[7:56:31] Technogre: I dont mind the grind I would just like variety to tue grind.. not the same dailies and world quests every other day
[7:56:42] dadbanger1: if a game is made to cater to those of us with full time jobs safe to say it is lacking content KEKW
[7:56:43] Moobot: Check out Towelliee's YouTube channel! You can view the most recent uploaded video HERE || M+ Theatre of Pain +20 - Road to 3k IO 9.2 youtu.be/v5uMXj-muhc
[7:56:44] smashwow: smashwow subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 94 months! 
[7:56:44] c0mmander_starscream: Yeah make rep account wise
[7:56:47] deckardblade: its insane they took away mythic+ upgrading from being account wide
[7:56:49] c0mmander_starscream: wide*
[7:56:55] Varchon: @fille1809, there are other grind systems...like farming for transmogs etc.
[7:56:56] Juvis: @Towelliee Whats you opinion on legos regarding the gold cost?
[7:57:00] vic_ave: Sadly no fast way to grind the rep out there either
[7:57:07] Dogjah: Agreed Len
[7:57:07] ashwing_: cypher farming on alts is utter bullshit especially when the dailies are useless other than providing cyphers
[7:57:08] ground4isu: As a casual player it’s ridiculous that each character I play I have to do the cypher for each one. It pigeon holes me into playing just once character.
[7:57:10] smashwow: basically everything we get in the .3 or the .3.5 patch feels like should be in the .0 patch.
[7:57:20] readyvic: i want flying from start with zones created around fly its dragons dragons dont walk.
[7:57:21] mmo_kenna_: I'm not bothered about account wide as only have time to play one char
[7:57:28] smashwow: vendor wise
[7:57:29] Xehanort1986: I just want reputations via tabards in dungeons back :(
[7:57:30] WundertueteGER: not worth doing rares
[7:57:30] nothumbgamer_ttv: rares give 10 rep each :D
[7:57:38] smashwow: and that
[7:57:38] Tokies: it's not. People are killing raids and doing all raid levels plus rares.
[7:57:40] Aquadriel: maw intro OMEGALUL
[7:57:52] Velashen: Seriously..  everything should’ve been account wide a long time ago. I can truthfully say I would have taken less breaks with the game.
[7:57:52] Gridness: Each rare gives like 10 or 15 rep so it doesn't make much difference
[7:57:55] smashwow: agreed
[7:57:55] tylerwithghosts: the maw intro still gives me PTSD
[7:58:01] Aquadriel: why didnt they make it account wide when it had been the previous 2 expansions still baffles me @Towelliee
[7:58:02] Gurtogg: legion and bfa had skips from the start, sl didnt weirdchamp
[7:58:02] Tokies: @Aquadriel err i read that and got a lil grossed out
[7:58:07] sedatdev: It's sad that this game sucks. Gave it a shot for 6 months. It's awful. I might give classic a chance to experience old wow that you all say is good.
[7:58:09] Kindosar: not only account wide, but baseline, no waiting for implementation
[7:58:15] Aquadriel: Tokies KEKW
[7:58:20] WundertueteGER: yea
[7:58:21] devslewa: Agree
[7:58:24] smashwow: the inconsistency of AcW things is mind blowing
[7:58:28] JackedDown: Yes! Once you put in the work you should have the reward. Period.
[7:58:30] pixxelina: amen
[7:58:31] HaxzorJimDuggan: can only help thrall find a weapon the maw so many times before its just triggering
[7:58:36] smashwow: skips != player power yet we didn't get it
[7:58:40] Kharsei: account wide? or just server wide?
[7:58:42] VrtniPatuljak: flyingavokado what parts did you find awful as a new player?
[7:58:47] t_a_t_s_u_r_o: Towelliee for President
[7:59:04] Greybeard_ttv: they need to drop the ilvl on conduits I always thought that was dumb
[7:59:10] Kindosar: @Kharsei why arbitrarily restrict at that point?
[7:59:14] lithium364: see world lags
[7:59:19] Coriollis: something like the second leveling route should have gave you the leveling xperience of the main story on top once u finished your grinding of the zone idk
[7:59:24] Mitune: I heard there was a code issue for some account stuff but most of that probably can be solved with a vendor that just gives shit
[7:59:25] Tokies: whole soulbind system should have been account wide from the start
[7:59:28] smashwow: you say that but at the same time we got things they said were impossible. never happen etc. @Towelliee
[7:59:35] Velashen: Yeah it should be a priority through development.
[7:59:40] deadman385: Spaghetti code lmfao @towelliee
[7:59:40] c0mmander_starscream: Will all the money BLizz has they should make a WoW 2.0 with new engine
[7:59:42] skeletorsyourdad: its hard to keep adding to a 20 year old engine
[7:59:47] KonaWolfeee: yoooooooo welcome back toweliee
[7:59:57] Dinosew: Dinosew subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 57 months! 
[8:00:00] trashedskeletor: I GOT TO 260 IN TWO WEEKS it was pretty easy too
[8:00:02] skeletorsyourdad: i mean the servers are archaic at this point
[8:00:03] smashwow: i think they need to rethink some of their PMO approach
[8:00:07] vanillahobbit: true
[8:00:13] smashwow: it should be account wide and a currency
[8:00:15] taibox: they just take up space
[8:00:16] pixxelina: I got 1700 taking up slots for no reason
[8:00:17] reggiepowa: its a tmog set I guess
[8:00:18] trashedskeletor: agreed
[8:00:18] smashwow: not a fucking bag slot
[8:00:23] Kindosar: they messed up the skip they put in initially, those that skipped early missed reputation
[8:00:26] kokochris: yup
[8:00:27] WundertueteGER: yea 󠀀
[8:00:33] taibox: NO
[8:00:35] Einzbern: VoteYea
[8:00:36] kokochris: right on
[8:00:39] Mitune: No
[8:00:41] taibox: not crazy at all
[8:00:43] raldrik: all currencies should bue account wide
[8:00:46] Darisen: i can only get so errect
[8:00:49] TDTPrem: Towelliee for Blizz CEO
[8:00:51] kenzincrafts: NAAHH you make perfect sense :)
[8:00:55] smashwow: @Kindosar ya but they did the ZM skip better. but it's not perfect either
[8:00:58] mith32: Stop making so much sense! :)
[8:00:59] deadman385: Your loco ese
[8:00:59] t_a_t_s_u_r_o: thank you.
[8:01:00] Mitune: They are just too stingy with items
[8:01:03] sedatdev: @VrtniPatuljak the story is bad. Some parts of it is good but it's so disconnected that there is no meaning. Endgame stuff are the worst in any game that I played. I'm not saying it's hard or anything. It's just stupid. Mystics are ok but the entire culture that it brings kills the experience
[8:01:06] jengosa: dragonflight the new mobile game cant wait
[8:01:07] Gruffian: So we have to make meaningful choice duh
[8:01:08] vic_ave: why are relics not in currency tab vs bags
[8:01:08] lithium364: crazy i say, heresy i say, the metrics tell us that players wanna grind everything on multiple alts LUL
[8:01:09] Coriollis: hey at least they gave back mage tower so thats a plus
[8:01:13] nothumbgamer_ttv: valor should be uncapped as soon as RWF is over
[8:01:14] misshotmore: !WOW10
[8:01:14] Moobot: @misshotmore World of Wacraft 10.0 Expansion LEAKED ON MAIN SITE! Could be deflection? Mebbe? THRE BE DRAGONS! https://www.wowhead.com/news/world-of-warcraft-dragonflight-expansion-leaks-on-blizzard-website-326583
[8:01:15] xoldwardog: blizzard delays progression so that you can continue paying for subscriptions.
[8:01:17] slaysin05: yeah probably because of bfa they just gave out items
[8:01:19] taibox: Also, is there a reason why we can't change conduits on the fly?
[8:01:20] Tokies: Afraid we will stop playing without realizing that it's preventing us from even starting.
[8:01:20] Phantomstrk: we are at the point of the expac that if i have a main that has gotten to 80 renown on a covenant, then why can't my alts all be at 80 renown.
[8:01:21] kowaikokoro: based take
[8:01:25] mizuryo: they think once we have ilvl we quit, but most of us just level another toon ..
[8:01:30] Dackor: season 1 it was yeah
[8:01:33] mizerboy: bring back WF/TF !!!
[8:01:34] pixxelina: ew vulperas
[8:01:36] JQ47: yeah it was in 9.05
[8:01:37] warrenny: Yes yes yes
[8:01:39] NA_Mus: yeah it was during the first patch and then they removed it during 9.1
[8:01:40] Khandak: They are afraid that if we get gear faster we will quit faster
[8:01:42] deadman385: @towelliee preaching the WoW gospel
[8:01:46] Kindosar: @smashwow yea was very happy about it, was showing their still working out kinks, even though we'd think its a duh
[8:01:48] TheCheeseWheel87: No, im pretty sure everyone thinks the same. These systems are just in place to keep us playing with "busy work" the longer the grind the longer the numbers of subs are and makes them look good for sub retainership
[8:01:55] kowaikokoro: NODDERS consistancy and account wide systems
[8:01:57] VrtniPatuljak: flyingavokado seems legit. was genuinely interested how new ppl see it. this is why they cant get new ppl
[8:01:58] mizuwaer: BIG TRUE EVEN FOR CASUAL PLAYERS!
[8:02:03] Mitune: Ah the greatest team 1 gnome 1 vulpera 1 wargen 1 mechagnome and a tauren KEKW
[8:02:05] kharditv: you should know blizzard don't do fun DansGame
[8:02:07] cptrogers123: Devs has no connection to the playerbase whatsoever
[8:02:13] Rektd_TV: they want everybody to be in the world first something
[8:02:18] ground4isu: 100%
[8:02:28] misomander: in 9.2 i play alts to stare at the lfg window KEKW
[8:02:29] Moobot: towBleedpurple towGold Thanks for supporting The Hammer Squad by watching these 3 minutes of commercials! towGold You also have the option to subscribe to further plant yourself in our community and no longer see ads! towUp towBleedpurple
[8:02:30] kenzincrafts: of we wannna have change of phase you dont wanna heal all content long
[8:02:34] CanadianCataclysm: Just like playing lost ark... Game Director says... o... raid hard lets nerf... o wait.. only 10% can do it.. nerf again.. and again until you have 25% or more doing the content.
[8:02:34] hagmania: alts should feel like NG+ material instead of fresh file
[8:02:37] pixxelina: and people would invest so much more time in the game if things were the way you describe
[8:02:37] Coriollis: fun? DansGame
[8:02:37] kenzincrafts: wanna tank or dps too
[8:02:40] kenzincrafts: i agree
[8:02:41] SensationalBanana: GW2 does the account-wide shit very well.
[8:02:41] lithium364: i feel like thats an hardpass for them tho, otherwise they would have done that already? somebody has to be dead set on making things not account wide at blizzard
[8:02:43] mizerboy: this is going to be a youtube clip on his channel.....preach it Towel!!!
[8:02:49] smashwow: valor being capped is dumb. it won't impact the RWF. the sheer amount of valor required to upgrade the gear to be impactful is DUMB. min valor needed to upgrade 1 ilvl pump is like 250. that's 2x the amount of valor you get from 1 dungeon run. 1 run that could take 30ish minutes. do that math on 14-16 slots.
[8:02:56] ZetYokai: wont happen sadly
[8:02:56] CanadianCataclysm: and it happens in a month.. or 2... not 8 months later
[8:02:57] Velashen: @sensationalbanana the best
[8:03:00] Maytan26: true
[8:03:09] kenzincrafts: yus
[8:03:16] jengosa: the end of BFA alt catch up systems etc were pretty good just make something like that more drastic for an entire expac.
[8:03:16] mytza24: because of this i can only run one character
[8:03:20] Maytan26: ff14
[8:03:27] critartist: that's why lost ark on the chopping block. i'm 600hrs in and have 1 1070 only done 1st raid but want my $99bucks worth
[8:03:28] misomander: what if it was a gold sink to story skip like lost ark has?
[8:03:29] kenzincrafts: lost ark is so fun to build alt chars
[8:03:42] jerseyfive: forcing people to do the same thing over and over again is the best way to lose players.. they should know this by now
[8:03:53] Venasmat: Imagine a job system in WoW
[8:03:59] sedatdev: @VrtniPatuljak I was so hyped to finally play WoW. I wanna give tbc classic a shot but I keep seeing how everyone is min/maxing everything and kills the experience. Seems like I just missed the wow era :(
[8:04:05] Gurtogg: cant you suggest that in ur streamer discord?
[8:04:06] Maytan26: have you talked to the devs about this @Towelliee?
[8:04:10] Goatsguffle: 100% agree. If I join a guild that needs a BM tank and My main was a DK. I shouldn't have to jump through 100000 hoops  to have that BM ready
[8:04:10] Mitune: They are stuck in the past to focus ed on MAUs
[8:04:14] critartist: i do have 7 500+ alts
[8:04:21] PotentialRage: PotentialRage subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 28 months, currently on a 1 month streak! 
[8:04:27] kowaikokoro: KEKW
[8:04:41] Coriollis: I haven't been more frustrated with a system in WoW than the rotation / week MOTHER
[8:04:52] smashwow: MAUs will follow good product. JS
[8:05:14] Maytan26: true
[8:05:19] wEiRdO_dUdE: Yeah it's kind of crazy
[8:05:22] Mitune: true
[8:05:23] critartist: and the jokes on me cause i don't have a sorcerer which is basically the only class worth a crap
[8:05:23] cptrogers123: The absolute worst part of wow is the time it takes to put in a team and actually have fun. it can take over an hour to put together a m+ team @Towelliee
[8:05:23] KonaWolfeee: @towelliee account wide and WoW. KEKW
[8:05:35] kowaikokoro: give your players what they want else we get another shadowlands PepeLaugh
[8:05:41] Shadoww_Fox: truuuuueeee
[8:05:43] Gizimoo86: true
[8:05:51] WundertueteGER: yea
[8:05:52] Tompsn_: true
[8:05:54] mizuwaer: TRUE
[8:05:56] pixxelina: pretty much what I ve been saying the last 5 years
[8:06:07] OnePlayerPete: this is me.
[8:06:08] smashwow: i remember back in the day. grinding out PvP gear in cata. getting that conq gear. then went to go pwn n00bs in bgs for hours.
[8:06:11] lithium364: ragetowel
[8:06:11] Sollice: As always I maintain....the loot pinanta in BfA from M+ was amazing. Allowing you to break it down for currency to let you target gear at specific ilvls was great
[8:06:13] SensationalBanana: If currencies were account-wide, I would be farming THE SHIT out of Grateful Offerings. Now I see the grind for ONE character to have the currency, and just don't bother.
[8:06:13] Shadoww_Fox: i want to being strong and use that power... on my main and my alts
[8:06:13] Birder_L: SingsMic SingsMic SingsMic
[8:06:21] KonaWolfeee: @towelliee would you say that's one of the main reasons people quit until new content ?
[8:06:23] Alienfromger: unlimited powa KAPOW
[8:06:25] Mahrquz: preach
[8:06:28] ground4isu: I actually think lost arks system for account wide and alts is really good.
[8:06:33] Tokies: this seems like a no brainer stuff
[8:06:48] Juvis: @Towelliee Whats you opinion on having to spend gold for legos?
[8:06:48] ongtehjem: the sexual offenders were in charge thus wow became so sloppy
[8:06:54] kowaikokoro: KEKW true
[8:07:07] KonaWolfeee: chat are you parking your mains for Lance master release ? I definitely am
[8:07:08] raldrik: They need to get rid of the time gating for alts. Like it feels so bad to do stuff on your main but then realize that you have weeks of dailies to catch up on your alts
[8:07:11] OnePlayerPete: I've cancelled my sub because I'd rather play something else than try and gear alts.
[8:07:12] Xehanort1986: @Towelliee I claimed the High Quality H20, so you better drink up
[8:07:26] Tokies: it's importanter for crafters to feel reward
[8:07:27] Destronicus: I think that mobile game design philosophy has taken over the MMORPG market
[8:07:27] Velashen: Yeah I don’t see why there is an issue for them if I have a stronger alt. Just means that I will be dicking around in the same zones farming the same mounts.
[8:07:30] tylerwithghosts: I don't mind having to spend gold on it, makes professions feel somewhat useful
[8:07:44] itsRynosuki: !9to5
[8:07:44] Moobot: @itsRynosuki https://twitter.com/towelthetank/status/1513389858378567681 - PHASE 1 of 9 TO 5 CHALLENGE
[8:07:49] wEiRdO_dUdE: It did make crafting important, but they made it crazy hard to craft higher rank legos, so less people did it, and that meant high prices
[8:07:51] smashwow: @ongtehjem won't say being in a hostile culture hurts dev. but this is clearly a "they're not aware of the player base" issue and PMO issue.
[8:07:52] kenzincrafts: gold is never an issue for an experienced player in any game
[8:07:54] VrtniPatuljak: flyingavokado ppl were always trying to minmax, they were just worse at it. its always been a gatekeepy toxic game, didnt miss muhc
[8:07:59] Tokies: Honestly, you can make 70k gold really easy just doing callings and mission board.
[8:08:04] Coriollis: just buy a token to skip , I mean no way I`m gonna start now leathworking and grind the leather and craft it all
[8:08:11] lithium364: inscription felt useless this expac... we only got trinkets to craft in 9.0..
[8:08:18] Nekkromonger: How is it you are always totally right??
[8:08:19] Tokies: that's mostly raw gold that's calling. mission boards and the chest boxes in world
[8:08:25] smashwow: @ongtehjem doesn't hurt* hostile cultures can dampen for sure.
[8:08:26] mizuwaer: TRUE

[8:09:07] Mitune: Leather is abysmal
[8:09:09] KonaWolfeee: @towelliee in other news.  we may get lance master on Tuesday :) ima be honest I haven't touched lost ark since you left lol
[8:09:09] Sollice: Professions in WoW have been boring for a long time. They need to hard rework it all
[8:09:11] Maytan26: i want to know why do they want the game so alt unfriendly
[8:09:23] VrtniPatuljak: flyingavokado there were entire specs you werent allowed to play because they werent optimal until WOTLK like dps paladin and priest, REEE how dare you kick
[8:09:25] Darisen: 1.5 mill on 2 character feels a bit much
[8:09:29] kenzincrafts: i dont want it to become fast phase like lost ark either :S cant figure the balance but i quit lost ark cuz i started doing just dailes and quitting

[8:09:38] Traumatize77: Traumatize77 subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 22 months! 
[8:09:44] chasmone: @Maytan26 Yeah I don't get it. Alts is the sole reason why I play. I  get bored of 1 character
[8:09:45] stabzmcgeee: !9TO5
[8:09:45] Moobot: @stabzmcgeee https://twitter.com/towelthetank/status/1513389858378567681 - PHASE 1 of 9 TO 5 CHALLENGE
[8:09:58] KonaWolfeee: @thekenzcz thats on you tho. the game is more than dailies lol . but I get you. lost ark isn't for everyone.
[8:09:59] Molvonos: I legit cant be assed anymore on WoW.  The balance tuning for dps has been stupid as shit.  I hate what they did with warlocks, since I hate playing Demo.
[8:09:59] rybreadgg: @Towelliee do you feel like the person in charge just isn't being passed this information correctly or overcomplicated systems/reward structures leading to them ignoring issues
[8:10:05] devslewa: They know;)
[8:10:15] Havoc_S1: No it’s not
[8:10:18] Tokies: don't forget about the side chics! they play wow too lol
[8:10:37] KonaWolfeee: @towelliee there's just so much at this point that making things account wide seems like a pain in the fucking ass
[8:10:39] wEiRdO_dUdE: Crafting is fun and useful, but if they can't balance it to respect time, then it's a pain in the ass that only hardcores can do....and then those guys squeeze everyone on lego prices
[8:10:48] PvtHudson093: work around would be to sell a token to make something account wide
[8:10:57] smashwow: i'm good with a vendor. just implement that fucker right and early
[8:11:04] mizuwaer: @Towelliee i think once you hit lvl 80 renow on one character every character gets it
[8:11:08] Beave_86: takes the least effort for them with vendor
[8:11:13] otzelof: I think at this point they might as well remove professions, like they did with first aid
[8:11:17] trashedskeletor: i hope they tone down the systems next xpac
[8:11:22] Kindosar: vendor is a good enough system, all it means is x variable is toggled on, could be something the put in to make gold useful lol
[8:11:25] rybreadgg: @PvtHudson093 my issue with this is, QOL should be opt out and not opt in. Players shouldn't have to go looking for QOL stuff
[8:11:26] BelacKriv: Vendors make you feel like you are 'DOING SOMETHING' to get the power
[8:11:26] wEiRdO_dUdE: Recently they tried to make lego crafting easier, but fundamentally their system was a pain in the ass
[8:11:28] Greybeard_ttv: They need to go back to basics in this next expac, no borrowed power just old school gearing maybe a badge system like in Wrath or some kinda not so exhausting rep grind like in MoP
[8:11:31] smashwow: 9.2 is better. but it's still not where it needs to be
[8:11:32] KonaWolfeee: @trashedskeletor doubt it unfortunately
[8:11:33] ZetYokai: 100% they just want to keep people on the hamster wheel is all
[8:11:33] kenzincrafts: @KonaWolfee  im done with almost anything on ark within a month man xD 1400 waiting for the next patch bored too
[8:11:34] darssia_: i’ll take a vendor over nothing, which i have a feeling is what it would be.
[8:11:39] mavericks312: the summer that they had also delayed a bunch of shit
[8:11:42] trashedskeletor: its better than beginning of BFA too
[8:11:45] smashwow: 9.2 feels like it was back in MOP-ish
[8:11:46] Moobot: Check out Towelliee's YouTube channel! You can view the most recent uploaded video HERE || M+ Theatre of Pain +20 - Road to 3k IO 9.2 youtu.be/v5uMXj-muhc
[8:11:51] smashwow: or WoD
[8:11:55] kenzincrafts: gues there must be a sweet spot
[8:11:59] smashwow: with the water cooler things
[8:12:04] cuddlybearboy_63: what are you currently farming?
[8:12:10] trashedskeletor: @KonaWolfee sadly true :(
[8:12:21] Greybeard_ttv: SL was the expac of systems which was terrible lol
[8:12:27] rybreadgg: @Towelliee what would you suggest for a returning player in 9.2 to catch up
[8:12:29] mmrghost7: yeah but 9.2 is kinda garbage compare to 8.3 and 7.3
[8:12:34] reggiepowa: its more work for them though
[8:12:36] Wcvechten: They should really easen up on systems for  10.0 and just ground it down a bit more
[8:12:37] Hypertitan: tier sets best "borrowed power"
[8:12:38] Korupcija_: "ohh maybe a vendor is solution for stuff"
[8:12:40] WoW_StandalonE: POGGERS
[8:12:43] Coriollis: yeah maybe they will realise next xpack MASTERLOOT was also a good thing , who knows
[8:12:46] wEiRdO_dUdE: People love tier sets and always have, I don't know how they forgot that
[8:12:47] tylerwithghosts: It honestly bums me out how many people complain about tier sets lol pick your battles
[8:12:52] eyewal: Chat does ElvUI have premade UI's that can just be downloaded and set up automatically?
[8:12:53] chasmone: I personally don't like how much time it takes to unlock flying for returning players. It's a core part of the game and takes 10+ hours to get
[8:12:53] Darisen: @Greybeard_ttv whats is even worse, is that covenant are fun now
[8:12:58] TDTPrem: Now bring back class exclusive looks instead of this "cloth" look and "leather" look etc
[8:13:04] JackedDown: KEKW
[8:13:11] smashwow: we aren't ever seeing ML again
[8:13:12] ZetYokai: thats exactly how the convos go there
[8:13:14] Mitune: The creation catalyst is still baffling to me
[8:13:15] kenzincrafts: not that we like sets its made mandatory to progress :(
[8:13:16] Syniatien: Life was so much more enjoyable when the game focused more on items than focusing on ability scaling. THIS SHOULD BE WOW!
[8:13:21] Kinghorn: everyone using it except resto shaman commenCry
[8:13:26] raldrik: oh and then only let them do one piece oa armor a week on the catalyst.
[8:13:26] smashwow: you want ML you're gonna have to play classic
[8:13:32] warrenny: Agree
[8:13:34] miriones: can you Raid whithout using addons?
[8:13:37] Beave_86: How long after an expansion reveal is the Beta normally released?
[8:13:38] MarquisLek: borrowed power is awesome time gated bs isn't
[8:13:40] Cjlbonkerss: havent played since WOD, is it worth hopping back in or should i justt hold off until next xpac?
[8:13:41] aggronautdh: @Luckido Flying is much easier in ZM than it has been in the past.
[8:13:43] SensationalBanana: Lmao
[8:13:43] Mitune: A power increase that changes how you play is always great
[8:13:43] pixxelina: LUL
[8:13:45] Korupcija_: tier sets are a good grind
[8:13:45] warrenny: My fav mogs are pally exclusives
[8:13:47] Tokies: I'd love it if the tier set look better. More class like. I'd also love it if every patch they came out with a transmog comestic set that can be collected in all levels of the raid.
[8:13:48] wEiRdO_dUdE: Borrowed power itself can be fun, yeah
[8:13:49] xNingg: most sought after dps spec in mythic+/raids?
[8:13:50] mmrghost7: lol
[8:13:51] sakura_2020: POGGERS
[8:13:53] Coriollis: borrowed power been since TIER1 hahaha
[8:13:53] jimmytingus: tier set double leggo opens up so much fun and possible builds. not complaining
[8:13:55] Greybeard_ttv: tier is fine
[8:13:57] valarbravoosi: just give double covenant ability KEKW
[8:14:01] stallowned: 1 shot everything POGGERS
[8:14:02] BelacKriv: I kinda like the 'go get your tier set' in LFR;  but you should be able to get tokens from the higher difficulties to upgrade
[8:14:03] jimmytingus: plus covenants to mix in with that. i enjoy it
[8:14:07] Hypertitan: i feel like the borrowed power needs to be there or you just end up with a million abilities in a couple expansions.  I don't know how else to stop the bloat
[8:14:08] dranet11: corruption was so fun
[8:14:13] Wcvechten: the ones upset about it didn't have it
[8:14:15] chasmone: @aggronautdh Yeah the ZM flying is fine. I'm talking about going back to unlock Shadowlands flying you have to do all covenant campaign and half of Korthia (old content)
[8:14:16] kenzincrafts: @Cjlbonkerss hold off men hold off
[8:14:20] R0NGG: corruption was lit
[8:14:21] mavericks312: the WoW community is the worst it doesnt know what it wants
[8:14:21] SensationalBanana: You're killing me here LOL
[8:14:24] Coriollis: I was upset by TD though, 1 shotted me in arena Sadge
[8:14:25] Tokies: In store quailty transmog on those tier sets.
[8:14:26] Greybeard_ttv: corrupted tier!!!!
[8:14:26] deadman385: All about Fortnite @towelliee
[8:14:29] DBtheAlien: What’s the 8 day countdown for?
[8:14:29] Moobot: towHAMUP Follow Towelliee on twitter so you can be in the know at all times! | twitter.com/towelthetank towKawaii
[8:14:32] eighte: LOL corruption was not fun like what??
[8:14:33] cobrauskis: cobrauskis subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 32 months! 
[8:14:34] Fensmarken: @Towelliee The thing I hate about borrowed power is when they take away all the cool interactions from a spec. Legion artifacts being gone - game felt like ass
[8:14:34] Sayryn: TD TD
[8:14:37] Cjlbonkerss: @TheKenzCz good looking out
[8:14:41] wEiRdO_dUdE: My double lego didn't do much for me, but with some specs and covenants it's really badass
[8:14:44] smashwow: i think it's more that the borrowed power makes the class feel better to play, because of smoothing out rotations. rotations shouldn't be janky without those systems. that's just bad spec/class design getting fixed via leggos or tier. that's not good either.
[8:14:58] CptnSwetPntss: !9TO5
[8:14:58] Moobot: @CptnSwetPntss https://twitter.com/towelthetank/status/1513389858378567681 - PHASE 1 of 9 TO 5 CHALLENGE
[8:15:00] PadidinJones: @Towelliee what do you think are the chances they will use dragonflights like they did covenants in SL?
[8:15:01] Jimstur: Cobra Kai will never die!
[8:15:12] kenzincrafts: it was always like that :D
[8:15:13] Greybeard_ttv: @towelliee exactly
[8:15:17] kenzincrafts: remember mist of pandaria
[8:15:20] ground4isu: I have an idea. How about of borrowed power we just focus on long term class design and not short term crap that’s gone in a year.
[8:15:23] ZetYokai: cos people are leaving, they need something to bring them back, its a trend
[8:15:25] Jakebeercan: its borrowed systems that suck
[8:15:28] Shadoww_Fox: like aways do
[8:15:29] kenzincrafts: siege of orgrimar was epik
[8:15:31] Syniatien: Just focus more on item specialization rather than abilities and it throw in unique builds based off of items. This is how it once was and it makes it exciting
[8:15:31] CptnSwetPntss: !WOW10
[8:15:32] Moobot: @CptnSwetPntss World of Wacraft 10.0 Expansion LEAKED ON MAIN SITE! Could be deflection? Mebbe? THRE BE DRAGONS! https://www.wowhead.com/news/world-of-warcraft-dragonflight-expansion-leaks-on-blizzard-website-326583
[8:15:33] kenzincrafts: icc was epic
[8:15:36] Shadoww_Fox: at the end of the exp
[8:15:47] Tokies: I wouldn't mind them not reinventing the wheel.
[8:15:53] Eregbueye: seems like they design their expansions backwards
[8:15:53] Mitune: ie pull the ripcord
[8:16:01] kenzincrafts: yea kinda :D
[8:16:11] smashwow: they're also not fully designing their classes either
[8:16:14] Snabido: signature?
[8:16:19] Fensmarken: signature
[8:16:20] Kindosar: i was excited about tier removal because it meant I didn't have to work around slotting gear
[8:16:33] BelacKriv: You think Dragon Aspect Convenants will be a thing?
[8:16:34] smashwow: classes not viable until tier or double leggos or even the right single leggo is not good.
[8:16:36] Greybeard_ttv: agreed
[8:16:36] wEiRdO_dUdE: My double lego = about 3.5% more damage (according to Hero Damage)....the balance never got great
[8:16:40] Coriollis: but they had to islands me for the whole xpack , wadda u mean azerite just for 1 patch, thats crazy talk Kappa
[8:16:41] kenzincrafts: and knowledge tranfer for alts xD
[8:16:47] chasmone: I like that they made tier sets available outside raids. I can't commit to raid times due to work but I still do M+ and other content
[8:16:47] t_a_t_s_u_r_o: agreed
[8:16:49] Greybeard_ttv: keep it simple stupid
[8:16:53] raldrik: needs a grind like anima into your soul or something
[8:16:54] Osroll101: yeh
[8:16:56] Wcvechten: I like the mount farm streams as it's just alot of discussing and vibes
[8:17:12] Shadoww_Fox: i stop play because the grind is too much for me..
[8:17:32] JackedDown: @Shadoww_Fox Then stop playing MMOs.. that's the entire point.
[8:17:47] DBtheAlien: Do we know timeline of when 10.0 would come out??
[8:17:47] wEiRdO_dUdE: They have to be careful if they try to reuse covenants, for sure
[8:17:47] trashedskeletor: i love the cov system without the power - and i agree one power all around thats the same
[8:17:49] Coriollis: I cant wait to farm Aspect Power Madge
[8:17:52] Tokies: I'm ok not to have legos
[8:17:54] ground4isu: We had to go the length of an entire expansion before our characters were fleshed out properly and that’s an issue with borrowed power/legendary system.
[8:17:56] pixxelina: so simple and works for everybody
[8:17:57] Mitune: over legos at this point
[8:18:02] Tokies: id be happy with 1 new button
[8:18:09] Darisen: leggos can be fun
[8:18:09] mavericks312: @Coriollis its an mmo grind something
[8:18:13] JellyBeansEU: easier for them to balance
[8:18:13] R0NGG: @DBtheAlien they announce 10.0 stuff on april 19
[8:18:15] Milanesa_De_Pollo: Even Rift had their own "covenant abilities" and was easy to switch around
[8:18:16] valarbravoosi: @Towelliee can you imagina a boomkin with double covenant? stack up that venthyr and rip a nightfae at the end?
[8:18:17] ThatGuyFayde: agreed
[8:18:20] Tokies: no more legos please.
[8:18:25] CAPT_Crack: I would not mind another expansion of covenant abilities in their current state
[8:18:25] t_a_t_s_u_r_o: give us Legion back
[8:18:27] EmpathyLiveChat: hmm
[8:18:28] Kisswani: A necessary evil in an 18 year old game
[8:18:30] Kammy_Kam: im over legendaries too... I want them to be a community effort again :(
[8:18:35] giggachadwar: and big map, not zone flight paths
[8:18:35] KonaWolfeee: toweliee is going in KEKW
[8:18:41] smashwow: lazers out the b-hole
[8:18:41] Coriollis: @mavericks312 grind yes, but with a limit
[8:18:41] wEiRdO_dUdE: Laser dragons!! lol
[8:18:42] Greybeard_ttv: Healing Dragon power!!!!
[8:18:42] Ranzinz: yeah, but we never had a new talent row anymore (4 exp now i guess?)
[8:18:44] miriones: bring back talent trees
[8:18:47] darssia_: honestly it should be the same power for each “covenant” just a different color skin.
[8:18:52] Wcvechten: I just want that, IF they do another covenant style thing with dragon, to just be PURELY cosmetic
[8:18:55] Shadoww_Fox: @JaycakesLive you dont understand... Shadowlands has the worse rind ever in wow History... and i simply dont have time to do it and make my character strong
[8:18:55] Mitune: boomer in mmo years
[8:18:55] Greybeard_ttv: Green breathe goooo
[8:18:57] Malkyr: I cant even imagine how bloated our bars would look if they never took abilities away but kept giving them
[8:19:03] wEiRdO_dUdE: Laser dragons is some legit Godzilla action
[8:19:07] Tokies: @Tatsuroo they tried in bfa and shadlows and learn all the wrong lessons from legion. overfocus on system instead of class fantasy
[8:19:14] Technogre: my ass turns into a dragon and blows fire after taco bell Kappa
[8:19:15] Valcrone: hope blizzard is watching with a pen and paper
[8:19:16] MarquisLek: i honestly prefer covenant/conduit to tier sets but thats because i don't raid
[8:19:18] Klax99: i like borrowed power i just hate it when my class feels bad without it
[8:19:24] UmmNoU: LUL
[8:19:24] Piebringer619: i want be dragonborn in wow
[8:19:25] Aquadriel: you were erping
[8:19:26] Snabido: This is one of those blackout nights, towelliee
[8:19:28] trashedskeletor: did you log out in a dungeon>?
[8:19:30] chasmone: @Malkyr Haha yeah. And more abilities don't make a class more fun. I think DH is a good example of that
[8:19:32] dracullus: default spot, you were stuck somewhere
[8:19:34] smashwow: @Klax99 exactly
[8:19:35] ground4isu: There is not a need for borrowed power. It’s a lazy way for class design.
[8:19:39] mavericks312: i will say they have the right man in charge to start some of those changes in ybarra
[8:19:39] Mitune: You were clearly looking for Mankirks wife @Towelliee
[8:19:44] skeletorsyourdad: they should use old zones more
[8:19:52] smashwow: BP should be an extension, not a fix to a class.
[8:20:05] chasmone: Borrowed power is fine as long as it's implemented properly
[8:20:07] reggiepowa: they can't keep adding stuff infinitely
[8:20:07] jaalexba: FORMALLY KNOWN AS LOVE ROCKET
[8:20:08] Kisswani: How is comign up with something new lazy ? wtf is that logic ?
[8:20:11] Mitune: barrowed power just needs to change how I play my class to keep things fresh
[8:20:11] KonaWolfeee: @towelliee listen dude we all know you didn't go to Vegas. I made a character in Una and saw you ERPing with Ninevah .
[8:20:12] kenzincrafts: we didnt need bp in mist and it was perfectly fine
[8:20:20] Clawanorder: When was the last time classes saw a brand new permanent class abilitiy
[8:20:21] PadidinJones: Its a way to grind! how else are le to become more legendary!
[8:20:22] miriones: i will return to WoW when microsoft is in charge
[8:20:25] Zettabyte: Everybody knows it!
[8:20:25] EmpathyLiveChat: Is borrowed power analogous to the old weapon skill in some ways?
[8:20:30] Coriollis: they will call it boring
[8:20:30] DBtheAlien: @skeletorsyourdad I like that idea as a player that only played through 9.1.5 SL....
[8:20:31] Greybeard_ttv: I'm just hyped for dragons!!!
[8:20:32] mmrghost7: bring titianforging back :D
[8:20:35] KingSlayerYotam: BP is fine, the aqwasition of it was terrible
[8:20:45] LawnSpeaker: The problem is that there’s no continuity or sense of progression between expansions… not sure how to fix it though
[8:20:52] noteworthynerd: !9to5

[8:20:57] eighte: lol you really don’t though
[8:21:01] critartist: maybe i should reactivate my account.  they sent me a "free" statue on the 10 yr
[8:21:02] MrFuzzynuts420: @Towelliee isn't that what a lot of people wanted? a return to basic of just having abilities and leggos?
[8:21:02] Gurtogg: remove conduits
[8:21:04] JellyBeansEU: bring back the ability to swap secondary stats to ones your class needs
[8:21:07] Mitune: sorta @EmpathyLiveChat Gear in general can be considered barrowed power. Its a bit complicated
[8:21:08] Templexx: just straight up dragon covenants
[8:21:10] Templexx: lol
[8:21:10] Greybeard_ttv: just give a breath ability for each aspect
[8:21:12] trashedskeletor: one for tank/dps/healer is cool but thats all i want at the MOST
[8:21:12] metavahn231: if these powers arent class themed i dont like them
[8:21:27] housetayblow: So are we keeping our covenant abilities in the next expansion on top of another potential BP skill?
[8:21:33] PadidinJones: They should have done a gag in Seplacure with Magni @Towelliee
[8:21:35] mmo_kenna_: wow is so formulaic these days, where's the creativity and passion
[8:21:39] Tokies: to caught up on the label of "borrowed" power. What I'm looking for personally is that if im in an elevator you can explain to me quickly what I need to do. to be scuessful in the xpac and it sounds fun. If you can't elevator pitch the fun. It's probably not gonna be fun
[8:21:43] skeletorsyourdad: so its basically the same expansion
[8:21:44] Kisswani: @Towelliee did you see the job posting for working on new combat system in wow ?
[8:21:47] darssia_: i just don’t like when a borrowed power is the only way a class is viable.
[8:21:49] trashedskeletor: id quit :)
[8:21:50] ZetYokai: that would be too muhc fun
[8:21:50] vanillahobbit: then im done
[8:21:53] skeletorsyourdad: they will
[8:21:54] CAPT_Crack: more covenants and renown PogChamp
[8:21:55] HaxzorJimDuggan: meaningful choice 2.0 Kappa
[8:21:56] Coriollis: well :)
[8:21:58] Shamwise: Shamwise subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 111 months! Booyah!!!!
[8:21:59] ArcaneSyntax: they said they aren't doing covenants again
[8:22:04] wildwittra: i want the dragon tail-swipe as an ability
[8:22:05] Greybeard_ttv: Gotta climb that tower to get to Alex
[8:22:06] t_a_t_s_u_r_o: brutal
[8:22:06] cipusanx: they had that in the past under the form of new class abilities and talents that continued to exist the next expansion. not this shit where you have one ability for an expansion and the next you have to chose between talents or some other buillshit
[8:22:08] Snabido: meaningful choice is free bingo slot
[8:22:11] smashwow: i'd be out. FF14 here we come
[8:22:13] WundertueteGER: maybe we get legion like weapon system Kreygasm
[8:22:13] miriones: isnt armor stats borrowed power?
[8:22:14] ZetYokai: you know it will happen
[8:22:19] KonaWolfeee: @arcanesyntax they've gone back on their word multiple times. don't expect anything
[8:22:19] medanmarko: Dragon aspect, meaningful choice 2.0
[8:22:22] chasmone: @Shamwise Love the name haha
[8:22:22] raldrik: I think it would be cool if they did the dragon aspecs like stances that you could just flip on a cooldown
[8:22:24] magemaster225: itll be like pathfinder all over again, "we think we liked how it worked out for the launch patch, etc"
[8:22:25] Templexx: yea that'd be awful
[8:22:30] Mitune: oof if they say those words I swear
[8:22:33] wEiRdO_dUdE: Choosing one aspect could be alright if they don't screw the min-maxing
[8:22:45] LawnSpeaker: But it’s almost a complete reset to character progression every expansion
[8:22:49] Gurtogg: we have Qwik now thank god
[8:22:49] Clawanorder: Imagine them thouugh, acting like having the ability to be any of the dragonflights be the greatest achievement since sliced bread.
[8:22:53] MarquisLek: shouldn't be multiple choice should be like the artifact weapon where you get one and you stfu
[8:22:58] ArcaneSyntax: @konawolfee not when they're that definitive.
[8:23:03] wEiRdO_dUdE: I like green, I want to do green stuff, but don't add powers to make me go blue, dammit
[8:23:10] mmrghost7: blizz fked up two expansion back to back , 3rd one is gonna turn this into nightmare
[8:23:10] GamerGoat56: YEP
[8:23:16] OhNoNotAgain: Long as Magni is locked up somewhere and I dont have to hear "Champion heal the wooonz" thats my bar for part of a W
[8:23:17] Klax99: they might make it simmilar to the azerite essences, where you get a main ability from your main "covenant" and different passives from the other aspects
[8:23:19] kenzincrafts: yup
[8:23:20] Zinx93: do you think they should keep any of the current covenant abilities around in some classes?
[8:23:22] KonaWolfeee: @arcanesyntax again. they've done it multiple times. it's better to be surprised than let down
[8:23:26] MrFuzzynuts420: account-wide isn't exactly a popular word in Blizzs vocabulary LUL
[8:23:28] chasmone: I think making most things account wide would solve a lot of problems and incentivize people to play alts more
[8:23:31] Coriollis: keep it simple like 1 big dragon hub and u swap freely with the color u need m+, raid etc
[8:23:33] PadidinJones: pull the ripcord!!!
[8:23:35] Velashen: Game will never die.. that said if covenants aren’t fixed and in 10.0 the player base will be bleeding hard.
[8:23:35] Cristiex2012: Have there been any believeable leaks recently?
[8:23:36] Eregbueye: what  if they make them cosmetic only
[8:23:37] raldrik: ion just going to say it for a meme
[8:23:38] SunnyAutumns: Meaningful choiceeeee
[8:23:40] ArcaneSyntax: @konawolfee examples?
[8:23:45] razor_bolt: Should be able to Play your alts not just repeat what your main did
[8:23:51] Templexx: meaningful choice then the first word in the new cinematic is "woons"
[8:23:56] Mitune: A Blizzard Intern is frantically changing the script as well speak from hearing this KEKW
[8:23:57] Lazermage23: They all give the same powers, but they look different per aspect
[8:23:58] KaisenSiru: @Luckido I manage 12 alts currently. No problems here ;)
[8:23:59] trashedskeletor: and if we have mission tables please ONE MISSION TABLE ONLY
[8:24:01] xendros78: the only meaningful choice should be whether or  not to play the expansion
[8:24:02] Baldarsar: @Towelliee and make all that ressorce stuff acc. wide too !!!!
[8:24:07] hatsihansu: or its just a spell which has multiple choices where you "channel your inner dragon" or something like that
[8:24:14] TheAbraxas94: only warlocks kekw
[8:24:15] Zinx93: let us do it on the talent page in rested areas next plz
[8:24:20] Korupcija_: renown though DansGame
[8:24:21] chasmone: @KaisenSiru Well you must have much more time to play than most people! :P
[8:24:21] wEiRdO_dUdE: Meaningful choice doesn't exist with min-maxing, they always find the best one
[8:24:34] knicknack92: Probably unpopular opinion but I liked being locked into a covenant early on.
[8:24:37] wildwittra: NEW Primary ability: Tail-swipe so you can flee from mobs and still hit them
[8:24:40] LawnSpeaker: The meaningful choice should be for cosmetic and utility stuff
[8:24:42] therealdemps: !9to5
[8:24:42] Moobot: @therealdemps https://twitter.com/towelthetank/status/1513389858378567681 - PHASE 1 of 9 TO 5 CHALLENGE
[8:24:45] ZetYokai: how dare you enjoy this degenerate gameplay
[8:24:49] mmrghost7: imagine if this was there day 1
[8:24:55] UmmNoU: TRUE
[8:25:09] MarquisLek: like talents!
[8:25:20] miriones: they want your choices to matter
[8:25:22] Katrikan: @Towelliee because they wouldn't change the code last minute
[8:25:26] theDirtyon3: Are we mount farming?
[8:25:27] Coriollis: yeah thats why people asked if the covenants are fighting each others, like it didnt make sense
[8:25:29] chasmone: Korthia *PUKE*
[8:26:01] Zinx93: freedom to play the game in whatever way you want to
[8:26:21] rybreadgg: I have the same issue with talents, why do you need an item to swap them?
[8:26:27] ZetYokai: you forgot what they said? being able to switch is degenerate gameplay
[8:26:29] board4life65: isnt it to much freedom at the beginning of the expanasion
[8:26:34] QQuirashi: all i want from WoW is for devs to pay attention to feedback they get regarding classes/features. they often ignore months/years of feedback that are meaningful only to implement it 2 expansions laters as if they re-invented the wheel. the more fun they make classes to play the more players they will have IMO
[8:26:40] TheCheeseWheel87: Game play was designed to follow the story, which burned people for picking the wrong covenant
[8:26:49] wEiRdO_dUdE: Yeah....trying to balance the factions has shown to be awful....keep the power out and let people choose their story
[8:26:50] Moobot: Check out Towelliee's YouTube channel! You can view the most recent uploaded video HERE || M+ Theatre of Pain +20 - Road to 3k IO 9.2 youtu.be/v5uMXj-muhc
[8:26:51] Redbearded16: I think Blizzard understands that the ideal game scenario might look like that, interchangeable account wide covenant stuff, but I think the business case for it is worse. Comes down to them making the best case for longevity to the upper tier of management regardless what may seem like the best to the player base
[8:26:58] StreamElements: Use code POGTOWEL120 for $120 off at https://strms.net/TowellieeFactorMarBot #ad
[8:26:58] Mitune: so just let us have fun?
[8:27:02] mmrghost7: meaningful he said
[8:27:02] Sollice: I prefer Sporks but to each their own
[8:27:04] theDirtyon3: highlighted paragraph WutFace
[8:27:26] Templexx: deff more than 9.1 for me
[8:27:26] pixxelina: same here
[8:28:00] smashwow: we know the RWF raiders played this one more 3wk raid LUL
[8:28:04] JackedDown: KEKW
[8:28:16] pixxelina: true
[8:28:16] Milanesa_De_Pollo: if 9.1 was SL release...
[8:28:16] R0NGG: true
[8:28:17] t_a_t_s_u_r_o: agreed
[8:28:18] Kisswani: true
[8:28:23] JQ47: no way that was a business decision
[8:28:24] R0NGG: make it fun and ppl will play
[8:28:27] ground4isu: 100%
[8:28:29] Templexx: its almost like ive heard that b4 with other xpacs haha
[8:28:35] reformedalex12345: payoS
[8:28:37] trashedskeletor: i would have even been fine if it was get to 40 renown then switch freelyu
[8:28:39] DoctorZzZ: have net liked the game since legion ended,
[8:28:41] Redbearded16: @towelliee I agree with you, but I don’t think upper management at blizzard agrees.
[8:28:54] Redbearded16: If they did then why wouldn’t they have already done it?
[8:28:54] onlybigkeys: They need to not try to make the game like old ass vanilla like they tried with shadowlands
[8:28:56] Mitune: Legion lego ptsd
[8:29:02] Cafe0le: if 9.1.5 was 9.0* switching covenants freely is everything
[8:29:02] Moobot: Towelliee is sponsored by GFUEL! The official energy drink of ESPORTS and THE HAMMER SQUAD! Use code TOWEL at checkout! http://gfuel.ly/3kf8stb
[8:29:08] smashwow: legion was the "modern" era
[8:29:12] Gruffian: They just dont listen to the players. They made all the changes we wanted since Alpha and Beta and wow, shocking, the game is more fun now.
[8:29:15] Mitune: They became very very controlling
[8:29:15] raye_gaming22: legion was good after 7.2 were you could farm 1 lego a week
[8:29:27] wEiRdO_dUdE: There probably is pressure for them to maintain MAU's, sure
[8:29:29] cerealkillas22: Yep Ian Hasacockinhisass always forces us to play his master design first
[8:29:29] Korupcija_: true
[8:29:36] Zinx93: i think a big problem is some players want an endless grind for power so they always have motivation to play as much as possible, whereas other players dont want to feel pressured to grind for power endlessly and still want to be able to keep pace with others. its hard to make both sides happy
[8:29:40] NickyNiclas: Legion 7.3 was so fun
[8:29:41] pixxelina: you think you do but you dont
[8:29:41] xVeskeRx: towHAMUP towLets towGo towHAMUP
[8:29:42] NecroTarkan: No Lost Ark today?
[8:29:45] Zinx93: they have to cater the game to so many different types of players
[8:29:47] Kisswani: Which is why I love what they're doing in 9.2.5 , experiment and refine systems in the end of expansion instead of expansion Launch @Towelliee
[8:29:50] Syllvn: @cerealkillas22 It;s not all on Ion at all
[8:29:50] Deltros123: That was why I quit
[8:29:53] xVeskeRx: xveskerx subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 6 months! 
[8:29:53] R0NGG: u would think they would get it and stop being so stubborn
[8:29:58] Wcvechten: pog HE KNOWS
[8:29:58] Mitune: You think you do but you dont ..... KEKW
[8:30:00] SensationalBanana: He knoooooows!!
[8:30:02] Murlock07: he knows
[8:30:04] Mitune: Kappa
[8:30:07] Coriollis: @chizu_gaming legion became good after broken shore and refind towards argus
[8:30:07] board4life65: stuff? do tell
[8:30:08] Cafe0le: he knows Kappa
[8:30:14] diln: payoS payoS payoS payoS payoS payoS payoS payoS payoS
[8:30:19] diln: agreed
[8:30:20] reggiepowa: and cross faction stuff
[8:30:20] wEiRdO_dUdE: It is getting better, I agree
[8:30:26] eyemyor: @Towelliee How do you feel about Lore leaving?
[8:30:34] Zucchey: @Towelliee They always approached this way at the end of expansions, nothing new regarding this
[8:30:36] chasmone: Small steps, I guess
[8:30:36] Milanesa_De_Pollo: They got rid of Bobby Kotick and his kronies
[8:30:38] Mitune: Cross faction stuff alone is going to feel great at least
[8:30:40] smashwow: idk 10.0 has to be super clean. we can't really go into 10.0 like 9.0 it has to be with the learnings with 9.2 forward etc etc
[8:30:42] SensationalBanana: Wait, Lore has left??
[8:30:48] snake_like: cross faction alone is yuge
[8:30:53] Kisswani: @SensationalBanana yep , for TikTok
[8:30:58] Coriollis: @eyemyor people argues that happened a few years ago Kappa
[8:31:01] SensationalBanana: ... Wat in da hell
[8:31:12] smashwow: yeah Lore left a week ago
[8:31:13] board4life65: was ZM and example of new blizzard?
[8:31:14] Destronicus: I play MMORPGs for the "world" aspect of them.  I quite WoW because it is no longer a world but a collection of minigames at this point
[8:31:18] cromedogg33: I've never understood how blizzard can be so oblivious to certain aspects of balancing. you have ret/kitty type shit that is pretty much unplayable at a medium to higher level
[8:31:24] Zinx93: the cinematic will be a banger that's for sure. they always nail those
[8:31:25] Templexx: good to hear
[8:31:48] duffluv22: What?!!! Nylak farming!!!!
[8:31:51] knicknack92: Do you like ZM zone @towelliee ?
[8:31:54] assman_ny: Easily implemented quality of life changes.  I think it will succeed going into the near future.
[8:31:55] Tokies: Everyone makes fun of The Emerald Nightmare for being to easy. But it really got people who had not raided in a long time back into raiding
[8:31:56] pk99: 8 days PepeHands
[8:32:05] falldrgn: They also got rid of all the litteral shit humans that were running the company and game
[8:32:14] ribose1982: When do you expect to see 10.0 release? This year maybe?
[8:32:26] kilius83: wonder if lore will ever restart tankspot
[8:32:29] raye_gaming22: caped valor lol
[8:32:36] lazyco105: 266 vendor?
[8:32:41] Coriollis: I'll belive it when I see a 40+ feedback thread of systems in alpha/beta answered before the last patch
[8:32:49] Mitune: Emreald Nightmare was easier but it was fun and more accessible. It felt so much more fun. Progression felt better paced @Tokies
[8:32:53] smashwow: still saying they need a valor vendor. much like the residium vendor
[8:33:04] trashedskeletor: I LOVE MIKE
[8:33:08] pixxelina: Mike towHAMUP
[8:33:10] Zettabyte: One of us! One of us!
[8:33:17] wEiRdO_dUdE: Yeah, Mike Ybarra is great
[8:33:25] its_hekks: @Towelliee ill come back to wow when its free.... only move they can make to save the game
[8:33:36] Molvonos: @its_hekks lol what
[8:33:40] NickyNiclas: He undoubtedly has an influence
[8:33:41] mmo_kenna_: is that the guy who sells carrys?
[8:33:41] theDirtyon3: @its_hekks your wrong but thats ok
[8:33:44] tydrennistv: you think we will lsoe ion?
[8:33:47] pixxelina: Well, he does want the Bolvar mace..

[8:33:59] Merkuriuz: LUL
[8:34:01] Mallaes: xD
[8:34:01] mavericks312: ban that guy
[8:34:01] Sephirothxz: @its_hekks you cant be serious rofl
[8:34:02] Gurtogg: He went from co leader to president, had no idea lol
[8:34:02] Arthrakz: ybarra making a big lan party in his conference room with his raid group
[8:34:05] Milanesa_De_Pollo: Rift is free
[8:34:05] MarquisLek: can't wait for wow dovahkiin
[8:34:08] Khandak: LUL
[8:34:09] wEiRdO_dUdE: They need that executive producer position filled with someone who knows about quality of life
[8:34:09] dracullus: even Draenor isn't free
[8:34:10] eyemyor: @Towelliee 10.0 seems like a good direction ... but do you have any predictions on where they will go after Dragons, in 11.0?
[8:34:10] Zettabyte: Elon Musk gonna save WoW Kappa
[8:34:13] dranet11: he can keep playing gw2
[8:34:13] CodeMasterr: KEKW
[8:34:15] ItsEddieAU: go back to lost ark

[8:34:17] reggiepowa: lost ark
[8:34:18] ProtoKoL_X: never gonna be free homie, stop with that nonsense
[8:34:18] Mitune: I could see them do Classic Wow stuff eventually going free, but huge doubts still
[8:34:19] Zinx93: have fun at level 20\
[8:34:20] board4life65: Xbox Game Pass $15 coming soon
[8:34:21] deadman385: Ban him
[8:34:22] diln: Rift LUL
[8:34:29] Kinghorn: RIFT POGGERS
[8:34:30] Nutsy: Do you think 10.0 will be a better game for the casual player that care more about world content then char progression?
[8:34:32] Tokies: @Mitune  Yep @Mitune asmongold was right. the first raid isn't suppose to be super hard mythic raider blah blah blah. I think half the reason so many people played legion was The Emerald Nightmare was so easy
[8:34:33] mavericks312: @board4life65 nope
[8:34:39] Nuggnuts: !wow10

[8:35:09] mavericks312: and with how easy gold is to make
[8:35:12] assman_ny: if you have to
[8:35:14] Kisswani: 260k EU danCry
[8:35:19] NickyNiclas: But our auctions sell for more as well
[8:35:22] Merkuriuz: only 256k eu atm :)
[8:35:30] raye_gaming22: boost 1 +15 key and you have your 200k
[8:35:30] Toradin: 150 k on NA ? Wtf
[8:35:35] seabunss: idk if ive ever even had 155k gold
[8:35:35] Coriollis: yeah I wanna play WoW for 6 months but because catchup was hard I played for a month got tokens from the rest and got boosts
[8:35:40] dracullus: it was 300k few weeks ago, but looks like certain people left EU servers
[8:35:42] HigameR4771: TwitchUnity LuvSign <3
[8:35:45] Sephirothxz: Remember every single other mmo that was proclaimed as the “wowkiller” LUL
[8:35:47] Salkin15: 280k for some time : )
[8:35:48] Toradin: Lol
[8:35:51] m__ber: Do you think with how little we’ve seen of iron lately and with Morgan now being an associate game director that ion will be replaced or leaving relatively soon? I like ion I kinda hope not
[8:35:54] falldrgn: if you cant afford the 15 bucks then you don't need to be playing WoW
[8:35:54] Snabido: The good ol' 20-30k days Sadge
[8:35:56] Kisswani: so the expansion will be like 600k gold KEKW
[8:35:56] theDirtyon3: damn it droppped 40 k in like 2 months
[8:35:57] assman_ny: Bulls and bears heh
[8:35:58] Toradin: its nothing
[8:36:13] Kisswani: Iron KEKW
[8:36:16] m__ber: Ion*
[8:36:17] brewgamingtv: Ion gone plzzzzzzzzzz
[8:36:23] Mitune: Ion is probably going to be moved to another project
[8:36:31] tydrennistv: ion is the og neckbeard we need him. scarab lord
[8:36:33] ZetYokai: oins gotta go
[8:36:33] wEiRdO_dUdE: Ion is great with raids, I can't see him leaving
[8:36:34] reggiepowa: slowly removing ion it seems
[8:36:36] NickyNiclas: Ion might be getting tired
[8:36:36] magemaster225: ion had that title right before being director
[8:36:37] Toradin: soft replace
[8:36:37] HaxzorJimDuggan: maybe its associate to the game director Kappa
[8:36:40] Kisswani: At least it's Morgan , so he's cool
[8:36:41] soth_klf: lol Ion had his chance and I would rather he be gone
[8:36:45] Xsilentghost: I dont want him as game director
[8:36:48] Cranghoul: Morgan > Ion
[8:36:57] Zaanthrax: @brewgamingtv ion has given the game one of the best games, to say u want him to leave is so silly, if anything he should focus more on raids
[8:37:02] Velashen: He really shouldn’t be doing any public speaking. Ion just pisses everyone off.
[8:37:04] Sephirothxz: I hope Ion will stay as raid fight designer that guy its just a beast designing raids
[8:37:07] Zettabyte: Ian moving to Diablo 4 Kappa
[8:37:11] dracullus: Ion had this title
[8:37:12] Clawanorder: Can't say i blame him, holding the weight of this game has got to be alot
[8:37:16] HaxzorJimDuggan: ion being called up as a lawyer again LUL
[8:37:18] Maytan26: WoW needs fresh developers and fresh perspectives
[8:37:19] magemaster225: the interesting bit is that both Morgan Day and Paul Kubit both have the associate game director title
[8:37:24] StoicTaurus: when you type into google "Associate Game Director" there are such a positions in other gaming companies
[8:37:25] dranet11: holinka put a tweet out like 8 months ago saying they were hiring a bunch of new roles
[8:37:29] smashwow: Ian going to WoW mobile
[8:37:29] darssia_: god i will miss ian not going to lie.
[8:37:32] pixxelina: Ion has given us amazing raids though
[8:37:37] Korupcija_: 🦀 Ion is gone 🦀
[8:37:39] smashwow: Morgan been there a long damn time
[8:37:41] Tokies: I hope blizzard hires back there customer serivce dept. and more game masters. that dept  needs help
[8:37:43] Coriollis: he might be burned out , idk raids were his thing since MoP and the raids were almost always awesome content
[8:37:49] knastik: assistant to the game director more like it haha
[8:37:57] SensationalBanana: I would never wanna be game director of WoW... the amount of blame and hate they get from the misguided fans...
[8:38:06] tydrennistv: i want more wow players working on wow. less tech people with fancy degrees who play fortnite
[8:38:08] raye_gaming22: isnt morgen the dude do did thorghast ?
[8:38:14] Maytan26: that part of the game is still very good
[8:38:17] twinkieruler95: cut from the same cloth
[8:38:21] mavericks312: ion is probably like fuck this games community with how much he gets blamed for stuff
[8:38:26] dracullus: Ion is tanking wow community for 7 years, that's not easy job
[8:38:29] Kisswani: that's Paul Kubit no ?
[8:38:29] wEiRdO_dUdE: Torghast.....ouch
[8:38:30] Mecabeast: didn't see an option on twitter but currently 0hrs on wow but before I quit was around 38.5hrs a week
[8:38:31] smashwow: Morgan seemed to think the creation catalyst being 6 months later was a great idea
[8:38:34] m__ber: I like Morgan but he’s not as good of a public speaker as ion. Ion is very articulate and detailed
[8:38:48] Darquesoul: Darquesoul subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 74 months! 
[8:38:55] DoctorZzZ: islands KEKW
[8:38:56] twinkieruler95: what is going on with morgan? just got here
[8:39:00] magemaster225: paul kubit also has the associate game director title right now on linkedin
[8:39:10] Horgoloth: ion is taking ALL the critics on the game in his face i can see someone beeing tired of that
[8:39:14] smashwow: @m__ber i'd hope Ion was good at that. he was a lawyer before
[8:39:24] scottb0tt: legion professions were lit

[8:40:54] Snabido: LinkedIn safer to update titles than twitter in case of out of context 😏
[8:40:54] smashwow: it's like a department head inside the game design team, maybe?
