[1:26:20] saund: @JokerdTV the downside of 10 man raiding instead of 40 is also there's more toxic people that leave groups because its so easy to get loot/groups, and checking logs/gearscore is more important because too many bad players can mess up a raid, in 40 man you can have 5 slackers and be fine

[2:59:39] lifeintern: which class will be DOA in P2 Jokerd?
[2:59:53] gxniusx: sod is probably a 1.5 year project
[2:59:54] Oopogo1: It depends what comes in P2...if P2 has the same amount of content as phase 1, it'll die faster than P1 did

[3:00:08] kekinsano: @AntaresSC2 KEKInsane
[3:00:09] fidd1efunk: Its also that certain classes are just incomparable in era. Try playing shaman in SoD, for example, and then going back to era shaman. You realized era shaman is an incomplete mess of an abomination of a class. After playing SoD shaman you would never want to play era shaman again
[3:00:10] ricbouro: Let SoD be nice and slow... let us casuals have fun
[3:00:11] obstata: solo shuffle is fun

[3:01:48] kharma99: @TumaPasvu KEKInsane
[3:01:51] notJumu: ulduar was forever
[3:01:53] weyw0t: wrath is dog tbc was actually better somehow
[3:01:53] Oopogo1: because people forgot how little Wrath has to do outside raids
[3:01:55] giraffeguy17: turns out tbc was better than wotlk all along haha, cant beat vanilla though KKool
[3:01:55] lilkreamys: it was to long
[3:01:56] jimbonni: ulduar so boring
[3:01:58] AntaresSC2: naxx was an easy gear up dungeon. Cata is harder and will discourage bad players
[3:01:59] Zyrax11: to hard xdx
[3:02:02] TrenerTrener: Ulduar is ResidentSleeper
[3:02:04] Brain_Freezed: wrath is shit, only popular because of nostalgia
[3:02:04] Noobish101: it was the same in retail
[3:02:06] Nooticer: quick alga
[3:02:11] ImSnow13: people realized its the same expan they've been playing for 14+ years and left kek
[3:02:11] rejlly: ulduar too hard for dad gamers
[3:02:12] Bewts: WOTLK is just an aoe fiesta and zero challenge outside of raids
[3:02:20] Derken11: Classic>tbc>rat
[3:02:21] charliedoto: mop will prolly hyped
[3:02:23] aevd: his viewpoint doesnt matter avg viewers, he only cares about what pumps the views
[3:02:25] Rakschas: ulduar killed MANY a gdkp because hardmodes were hard for really bad players
[3:02:26] kharma99: @AntaresSC2 cant wait for them to try shadowlands classic KEKInsane
[3:02:28] Oopogo1: wotlk has virtually no content outside raids man and people forgot that

[3:03:57] TrenerTrener: The thing abt cata is, pvp is more fun, so you can actually enjoy pve and pvp imo
[3:03:58] xhady28: IF they make M+ on cata?
[3:04:03] grylz89: Cata will be the 1st version of classic I will not play
[3:04:05] necralia: artas ok
[3:04:08] Faded_Funk: Cata was trash i don't why anyone would want to replay it

[3:04:24] dogmenz: I think running ICC is fun, but it's not enough to keep you logged
[3:04:28] lyrie77: Prefox still doing ICC on 13 chars xddBased

[3:05:11] asist0ne: flex
[3:05:22] Oopogo1: wrath just has NOTHING worth doing outside raiding...nostalgia kept people from remembering that and that is why WOTLK steadily declined after prebis phase

[3:08:14] TrenerTrener: Its normal in retail bcs its actually hard
[3:08:22] Brain_Freezed: @realpan114 I get what you're trying to tell me. Im just saying if you're not playing pvp. There is literally nothing you can do with your lvl 80 character unless you raid
[3:08:28] Johnnyy_Salad: @Justadoggie yes. what about feralization?
[3:08:35] Bewts: Split raiding burned a lot of people out too.
[3:08:44] MrJohnzy: just admit it: you became lazy

[3:09:06] Clazzicola: yea 8 is bis
[3:09:09] PhilFancypants: ok

[6:36:09] NotXasmur: its like EPGP jokrdYikes
[6:36:09] Goated_Goods: WIth no more customer support from Blizzard. People are just becoming more shameless. Ninja looting everywhere.
[6:36:14] exteps: at that point its just sr
[6:36:18] LightBladeStream: Softres
[6:36:18] jazzyjoff: Blizzard can trace down bots by assessing (with AI?) the item/gold for any suspicious activities. Don't put everything on buyers because that is just half the solution. Bots needs to be addressed to. But honestly, this is a lot of operation costs for blizzard so they will prob be better off by leaving it like this (from a financial perspective).
[6:36:20] brandonsear: Omg of course an ad comes on as soon as he responds to my question

[6:36:45] darkbow17: its so good
[6:36:51] StripSniper: It motivates people to tolerate shitters too if they have gold
[6:36:52] LightBladeStream: GDKPs are good, but they have a higher barrier of entry
[6:36:53] MVPeteTV: game should give you gold when you complete raid
[6:36:53] siangsiang777: gdkp is a good system, buying gold from bots is what makes it feel unfair

[6:37:49] fishcakexl: Ask them to join Reformed :)
[6:37:59] brandonsear: Gdkp is just dumb because most people buy gold, only way to compete in a gdkp is to buy gold
[6:38:08] GeniTV: 3warnings than ban them permanent
[6:38:08] padoruisnigh: Blizzard should have the means to really crack down on gold buying but they don't because it keeps people playing + money flowing from all the bot accounts
[6:38:16] Fenruh: lone wolf is pretty bad for bots right now
[6:38:21] subsonic_eye: 60-70% of player base would be gone i think

[6:39:16] anzeb: 20g pearl GDKP I lirly cant, which idiot thinks that's good
[6:39:18] jazzyjoff: GKDP is on paper on nice system but that's from a position that people will choose to take the easy road to progression. What opens the path for some players to buys their way into that progression.

[6:40:13] TrenerTrener: @TrebekTv For that to be significant it has to be high af, which messes up the casual player once again
[6:40:18] Azibex: @Vohry1 HUHA
[6:40:19] spiritsland: seems like its the way things are going tho
[6:40:25] ATcaribou: when that happens, ill be doing gdkps to soak gold. not going to lie. ill never buy gold, but ill soak it from the buyers
[6:40:26] Vohry1: @Azibex DUGA
[6:40:28] brandonsear: I mean GDKPs werent a thing during early classic phase 1 and people still got loot by joining guilds
[6:40:37] perm: so is cataclysm classic gonna flop because of all the gold on wotlk?
[6:40:37] butterzugzug: @anzeb there are no other trinkets with spellpower/healingpower/attackpower untill lvl 60 in the game beside maybe new raidtrinkets in gnomeregan and the lvl 50 raid. so what are 20g for a trinket which maybe will be replaced in one year?
[6:40:37] laimonas1121: Thats whythey must lock servers and olny in some time merge em
[6:40:56] 5iftyfourth: last gdkp i did was 4 mo ago on wrath to pay for my classic account

[6:44:47] btrflylol: yo joker, any tips on how to lvl fast on palworld?
[6:44:50] jazzyjoff: The root cause is the gold-system that enables you to progress to an extend that 'normal gaming' isn't worth it for a lot of ppl. I think for most gold buyers it's all about saving time to do the things they want.
[6:44:52] anzeb: @butterzugzug touching grass is more important then spending IRL money for ingame gold to buy itmes
