[0:27:08] StreamElements: Anhak just subscribed mesDad mesDad mesWeckso
[0:27:17] Anhak: Just putting it here cause i see a lot of normals we are allowing alts in main raid your in guild character that is roll main is your main (except nik) and alts do not get soft res and will roll 1-99 to show not a main so that way peoples mains get the 1-2 missing pieces
[0:27:19] crosstip: haha
[0:27:19] Anhak: Thanks cross
[0:27:27] crosstip: np
[0:28:07] Anhak: but since all mains have trinkets and such and some of us are full bis or just chasing 1 or 2 items etc it just makes sense with the raid becoming way easy for us to do that
[0:28:27] Anhak: we go back to SMOrc play mains etc next phase obviously until we find the raid in a similar spot

[3:44:36] TrippyvV: That was goin good too
[3:45:25] sean_spelled_like_seen: @TrippyvV double caster is always good because it usually has pretty solid cc. if you line up cds and stuff right it makes it pretty annoying to play melee cleaves into it
[3:45:49] sean_spelled_like_seen: hybrid and double caster always tend to have the upper hand on pure melee cleaves
[3:46:17] happyheals: harder to reset and drink for the melee team
[3:46:19] TrippyvV: Yeh fair, just the sheer dmg of destro/sp looks busted rn
[3:47:05] TrippyvV: Dudes are parsing 99s
[3:47:26] sean_spelled_like_seen: that's also because they're just getting to chew through 2 melee who have to stand in to do damage

[5:07:40] al_capow: hmm
[5:08:07] al_capow: is the cast bar text  in a separate frame?
[5:08:32] al_capow: you could make a WA that, on cast, changes the text frame anchor
[5:09:01] al_capow: there might be a race condition there depending on how the event works but it might work
[5:09:37] al_capow: make a blank text aura with a custom event trigger for cast start and try it
[5:10:27] dawsonator171: you need to use "SETPOINT=DEEZ" for it to work.

[8:02:17] honsou2: if you finish a statement asking whats wrong with yourself, it does not benefit anyone to be inclusive
[8:07:44] honsou2: no that was a response to you. It does not make sense to say "i think thats great" in reply to someone expressing dissatisfaction with their choices
[8:08:16] avenueone: lol
[8:08:28] honsou2: He verbatim expresssed it as a bad thing, i did not read into anything

[8:09:33] coldgrayrain: now 2 of the same claass i just cant do
[8:09:38] honsou2: me too, and thats totally fine. The case is that he said "whats wrong with me" not "i like leveling these"
[8:10:27] honsou2: Is probably what? a suggestion
[8:10:42] happyheals: will you be my friend
[8:10:55] coldgrayrain: no idea how people have more than 1 max level of the same class = P
[8:11:08] avenueone: i think people perceive text differently
[8:11:14] avenueone: no emotion in it
[8:11:35] avenueone: could be i dont know
[8:11:39] avenueone: thats what im saying
[8:11:55] honsou2: i was not being hostile. A lot of people level alts when they actually want to push rating. The "whats wrong with me" made me think he was like that, because i used to  be
[8:12:08] coldgrayrain: not sure if i like the new slappy hands or not
[8:12:30] avenueone: mes why did u level a dk

[10:00:14] miapx: Hi
[10:00:19] happyheals: Just a small living room set
[10:00:26] happyheals: no big deal
[10:00:32] guinnezz2: Mes how do you feel about the current state of retail. Kinda feels like it dying out.
[10:00:39] thunderstud25: i can come on warrior?
[10:01:35] yepbeef: trying out dannycarrys rbg build
[10:01:46] guinnezz2: I hate ever stating a game is to hard to pick up an play because the die hards will rip me to shreds. But i feel its one of the biggest issues with retail. Its hard to get new players and old players back due to complexity of pick up and play
[10:02:14] guinnezz2: especially in PVP
[10:02:48] miapx: Send a hug I'm in the hospital, my daughter was born hahaha sorry for the English I'm Brazilian and I love watching your PvP even though I don't understand sometimes
[10:03:01] guinnezz2: Then again the success of SoD probably doesnt help the active retail numbers
[10:03:15] raphaelionthecoolkid: congratulations miapx
[10:04:22] miapx: Tyyy ^^
[10:07:50] PromiscuousToilet: @guinnezz2 i dont think retail is dying out. its much more popular than SoD and such. The playerbase is just more spread out

[10:34:37] gachie_: anyone know what the fastest way to level from 60-70 is? just questing+spamming dungeons?
[10:35:54] ZealotryTV: is it better to just run crafted gear outside of tier and weapon?
[10:36:05] ZealotryTV: i guess trinkets too
[10:37:09] PromiscuousToilet: @gachie_ paid carry
[10:37:51] ZealotryTV: with the caveat that you already have a level cap toon
[10:39:39] gachie_: mm

[10:40:01] undertreex: @notmes do you know where i can get a death freezing trap weakaura, or do you have a video showing how to make a weakaura
