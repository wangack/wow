[2:14:18] Sphinx2k: warrior healer
[2:14:24] warcraftbuddies: Positive.-
[2:14:27] zwann99: crit flattens in pvp at some point
[2:14:35] Hyelander_: its a critical decision LUL
[2:15:05] Shalyon: thats pve

[2:15:16] zwann99: 21% is 1.2s gcd, 31% is 1.1s gcd
[2:15:17] warcraftbuddies: Your crit is fine as it is now. Once you get more gear it will be at what it needs to be at, but never focus on crit
[2:15:26] Bgarrison1: Go with the crit why not

[2:55:36] warcraftbuddies: @Steelsky_ Its still not on par with the other talents.
[2:56:17] warcraftbuddies: It would only work if you played in a random RBG, once you reach the higher ratings it becomes as useless as standing AFK
[2:57:13] warcraftbuddies: You have the best three pvp talents that everyone uses, nobody uses others. :D
[2:57:20] warcraftbuddies: But you forgot to choose sins of the many.
[2:58:10] TheCosy: swift honest question, if you compare the warlock to the priest, what would you prefer? Im kinda searching for a new class to play
[2:58:46] zwann99: lv 40 row
[2:58:54] Steelsky_: @TheCosy play the one you think is cooler or try them out and see which one fits :P
[2:59:32] Steelsky_: @warcraftbuddies Yeah idk it worked me onwards of 2k, I've had a different experience than yours didn't have a problem with my talents
[2:59:35] mentulgg: you playing alliance or horde these days
[2:59:47] DrongoLightning: what's the addon for the flag taken announcements?

[3:15:55] freezy118: Fate*
[3:16:21] warcraftbuddies: The only talent you want to change out now if you do arena or RBG is trinity

[6:02:09] The_Farting_Spaniard: Theres a huge demand for him and his popularity atm is off the charts. People would be stupid not to bring him back into films
[6:02:11] officialzeri: Amber is appealing
[6:02:13] Metalcalfe: Depp said he'll never work with disney again, even if they want him back.

[6:11:47] officialzeri: Disc has to do some damage to do healing
[6:11:47] warcraftbuddies: Yes
[6:12:00] warcraftbuddies: Yeah you can i think
[6:12:00] maskedboy999: whats the name of the wings addon
[6:12:12] warcraftbuddies: Just shield first, then heal
[6:12:24] warcraftbuddies: Switch health to percentage
[6:12:35] warcraftbuddies: if that dont work then heal shield
[6:12:55] warcraftbuddies: You can also hold if you're scared, get wings pop a defensive on him then heal

[6:16:55] nonstopdisco: feared too early
[6:17:02] officialzeri: I donâ€™t think it matters if asmon plays with him or not lol, heâ€™s still a big hit
[6:17:14] officialzeri: Anyways, good defensive swift!
[6:17:47] Galdrena: FailFish
[6:18:00] warcraftbuddies: You're too much in the open swifty, you have to hug the corners.
[6:18:00] officialzeri: Okay enough about asmon ðŸ˜‚
[6:18:12] puggaming_21: cc won that
[6:18:25] MRuTV: Agree lol.
[6:18:43] Tiebot87: Hard to get CC thru pillars.
[6:18:47] warcraftbuddies: Because when you get wings, then you get cc'd 24/7 which makes it hard for youto utilize the buff
[6:18:47] officialzeri: I didnâ€™t know feign death took away bleeds, Iâ€™ve been away from the game for too long
[6:19:05] warcraftbuddies: That's why you have to hide
[6:19:19] warcraftbuddies: As soon as you get wings, hide then use penance
[6:19:27] warcraftbuddies: hide then shield
[6:19:28] puggaming_21: hugging corners is a good idea, dont let them free cast
[6:20:01] officialzeri: Hugging corners was my specialty when I played holy paladin in legion lol
[6:20:18] warcraftbuddies: no no
[6:20:22] warcraftbuddies: Against 2 dps its kind sketchy

[6:27:13] sekyst: PS higher hp too
[6:27:20] uncleflexxer: Its good to use Rapture and spam a few shields on yourself. The fat rapture shields are a good first line of defense
[6:27:20] officialzeri: I want to start streaming soon.. I just donâ€™t know where to start. Any tips @swifty ?
[6:27:30] sekyst: warriors smash lol
[6:27:37] adidas_123: rapture first
[6:27:44] adidas_123: and during rapture only shield
[6:28:10] uncleflexxer: Rapture is not a 1 time press button you wanna give yourself many shields with it
[6:28:15] adidas_123: just spam shields its so strong
[6:28:22] wests_100: Did you do the new quest for dark iron dwarfs .?

[6:29:21] maskedboy999: Fury warriors
[6:29:37] puggaming_21: warrs are nutty rn wow

[6:31:14] adidas_123: ppl who dont know anything giving advices it seems
[6:31:40] adidas_123: disc is all about predicting dmg not purposely leting your self drop to 35% in pvp makes no sense

[6:33:19] dook0okem: get the crate
[6:33:23] dook0okem: next to flight master
[6:33:25] dook0okem: 375 conquest
[6:33:39] maskedboy999: 20 Mins what are u sayng Is Just not true LUL
[6:33:40] adidas_123: just think of it as safety net swifty that helps you if you get low dont let your self drop that low on purpose tho they will just kill you the dmg right now is pretty crazy
[6:33:45] shikari01: what crate?
[6:33:49] dook0okem: in oribos itll give you a piece you need
[6:33:49] officialzeri: @josh32887 then donâ€™t play it. Simple solution
[6:33:50] adidas_123: healers have it hard atm
[6:33:57] uncleflexxer: Bro im a duelist priest and that 35% advice is not right. I dont even play that talent, play catigation talent for fatter penances swifty. Disc is good for preventing damage not beringing someone up from 10-20%
[6:34:00] maskedboy999: maybe awc games 3s only rank1 on dampening u have 20 Min games
[6:34:11] dook0okem: in oribos next to the flight master, new vendor sells 262 ilvl conquest crate for 375 conq
[6:34:12] officialzeri: I heard thereâ€™s a shortage of healers atm
[6:34:19] warcraftbuddies: @adidas_123 Its the build he plays, it works great.
[6:34:30] warcraftbuddies: Its a 3s, rbg build
[6:34:49] tyrann1cal: yea you are
[6:34:55] gotcha2157: you've been trolled for sure that sounds insane
[6:35:09] Streeredemption: Do you play Arcane mage??
[6:35:12] maskedboy999: @josh32887  naaa Is Just more complex and pple dont like that :)
[6:35:17] officialzeri: Trust your intuition swifty!
[6:35:20] adidas_123: in no world you let your self drop on purpose in pvp @warcraftbuddies with class thats all about midigating dmg not healing trough put
[6:35:22] uncleflexxer: Just think about it "Ok my job as a healer is to let my dude die" haha no way

[6:36:17] tyrann1cal: yea pretty sure
[6:36:24] TyrWinter: not until Q3 this year i believe
[6:36:24] tyrann1cal: it might not have gone all the way through yet
[6:36:26] lizardo221: Is there a reason for Night Fae over Venthyr?
[6:36:27] Humble925: Yes
[6:36:28] TyrWinter: Hasnt gone through yet
[6:36:38] Humble925: Next year they take over
[6:36:44] officialzeri: Oh gosh thatâ€™s crazy! Hopefully they donâ€™t change too much :(
[6:36:48] Humble925: Itâ€™s final tho
[6:36:59] uncleflexxer: Swifty if you go into DKs as a Disc try taking Big Dome talent and pop it on yourself when he grabby hands for 50% less damage
[6:36:59] Killshotqt: HEY SWIFTY!
[6:37:06] fatlol2: Whatâ€™s your renown
