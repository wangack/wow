[5:31:41] Lanicor91: @winsong I'm not dreaming about it, I'm telling it as is - and they are getting buffed, people will be crying - the only issue is pve, which is what the buffs should be addressing but they will actually boost their pvp damage even more
[5:32:08] 0N3T0UCH: a man - da

[5:36:14] KRISHN0F: Ah, behold the enlightened one! He speaks of wielding the mythical "woe and rb" combo like a modern-day sorcerer, while the eternal dance of kiting vexes even the bravest. The buff promises greater dw damage, yet holds no sway over rb maelstrom or the mighty 2h. Alas, our dear friend speaks with fervor but reveals his ignorance. To play enhance is a task for the chosen few, while the rest of us gaze upon its insanity. Such is the spectacle!
