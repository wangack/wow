[1:33:36] Arkan1n: is this a old recording ?
[1:33:47] Skizzurp: yea they got to add platforms and they literally sent every1 to 1 side and they still couldnt finish 1 platform so...
[1:33:53] Aidiand: Yes @Arkan1n
[1:33:54] REDSUNDERGROUND: itll go down the 23rd
[1:33:55] skylaars: i kinda want to see anoyher kiljaedan
[1:33:58] Alaquane: @Arkan1n bro. he's responding to chat comments. no it's not a recording
[1:33:59] BadAtlasGaming: umm... arent' servers down? I'm confused
[1:34:08] SamuraiWillZ916: did the devs complete the raid before release? why do they release a raid and its not clearable?
[1:34:08] Arkan1n: ty ty :)
[1:34:09] im_capy: no chance they want to repeat jailer again
[1:34:13] Dcarter: No that’s not ok
[1:34:15] happybooger: EU server
[1:34:17] Dcarter: That’s actually stupid
[1:34:18] Carahail: @BadAtlasGaming He's on EU
[1:34:20] xraynibba: imo i find it fun watching the guilds slowly progress
[1:34:23] Shiz_zap: eu
[1:34:24] Holysal: HES ON EU CHAT
[1:34:25] Sonatta: @BadAtlasGaming EU
[1:34:26] Aidiand: It will be dead soon
[1:34:33] Gravirtus: is it a bad thing for a boss to be unkillable for a longer duration?
[1:34:37] xraynibba: tru tru
[1:34:45] warrenny: Sucks hard bosses wont happen
[1:34:46] Shiz_zap: facts
[1:34:50] SilkeySmooth: so just watch on day 1 and then day 10?..lol
[1:34:51] WizzardMac: Did the devs even test that? lol
[1:34:52] boopbopbamski: I dont watch them prog anymore i just come back and get updates every few hours
[1:34:52] Shiz_zap: 1% progress
[1:34:53] raldrik: only way it makes sense not to nerf it is if they release something saying y'all are doing it wrong there are better strats that you are missing
[1:34:54] PotbellyGoat: it wasn't fun seeing both stopped at the same %
[1:34:59] g0n_z3n: it's a wall straight up
[1:35:02] xraynibba: you make a good point good sir
[1:35:03] im_capy: "ooo look they did .00000001% better...thats amazing....." Kappa
[1:35:13] BadAtlasGaming: that's oceanic right?
[1:35:14] papascruge: but liquid banter makes the watch enjoyable even if it's hard wall
[1:35:14] Aidiand: I enjoy RWF. I enjoy watching Echo streams they have good casters
[1:35:21] BadAtlasGaming: cause i can't get on  there either. says offline
[1:35:23] Dcarter: Gingi even said n it kiklable atm
[1:35:30] hadusii: true
[1:35:34] kashmara: 64.83 vs 64.82 towStop towIt

[1:35:37] Captain_nShaneO: practice!?  practice!?  man we ain't even talking about a game.. we talking practice... practice???
[1:35:48] topher057: I mean they really already perfected phase 1. And then you see the same shit in the add phase every time
[1:36:01] amayaraven: @BadAtlasGaming he on EU
[1:36:12] Aidiand: Wish they did week 1 raid Worldwide reset
[1:36:27] Aidiand: But it only matters for the top0.01%

[1:36:48] SilkeySmooth: i say blizzard is doing wall
[1:36:50] kazzykiins: Does the conquest bar reset? (sorry new)
[1:36:52] tastytictacs: if they nerf it before echo reset, there will be outrage.. lol
[1:36:54] xraynibba: full gobo racial
[1:36:56] Felric_DH: i think this wall is excellent, the concept that theyd have cleared it in one week
[1:36:58] RodneyIsPro: its more like top .00001% lol
[1:37:04] beauds69: I hope its not the first scenario
[1:37:20] daniel85mg: l
[1:37:25] Alaquane: just bring some saronite bombs, maybe that'll work again
[1:37:27] Wcvechten: Honestly even on normal the jump from Broodkeeper to Raszageth seems pretty big,  can't  even imagine how it feels to do on mythic
[1:37:28] Aidiand: Naxx was a joke. Cleared 10man and 25man same night
[1:37:30] warrenny: How long did broodkeeper last?
[1:37:37] BlueFalcon174: is it really undertuned? Thierry ILVL is still very low for Mythic Raid
[1:37:37] Felric_DH: if it was the normal release schedule like it was in the past then ok, but given this is literally 3rd week of xpac and 1st week of any raiding minus m+ then it would have been to easy of a race
[1:37:43] xraynibba: its kinda of cool tho having an enemy live up to their perceved threat like the lich king
[1:37:51] Grainhouse: @Towelliee just saw your vid on tama's dragonflight helper and have to say amazing vid.... been looking for something like that for awhile now. you are a master class
[1:38:03] spartancuz_: what xp bar is that?
[1:38:06] Hafcool: I mean, isn't it supposed to be like this? The deeper you progress into the raid the harder the boss is?
[1:38:19] kazzykiins: Does the conquest bar reset? (sorry new) @Towelliee
[1:38:22] Felric_DH: normal progress is that m+ and n/h raid release week 1
[1:38:26] artiBEAST: Either way it’s kinda rough for blizz.. if they let echo reset then it’s like do they nerf during echos sleep/lunch break or limits sleep/lunch break
[1:38:26] laeenaravenholdt: @Spartancuz__ it's a WA from luxthos
[1:38:31] Metixc: i already feel nostalgic for DF launch, is that weird? that launch felt different than others for some reason
[1:38:34] Felric_DH: then they grind that out and then push mythic raid
[1:38:34] kimmo_gaming: Lich King was the ultimate boss, 20 minute fight, 5 phases, that showed skill, although 2 months was a lot
[1:38:35] Skizzurp: the shit part is that no matter when they nerf one team gonna be ahead
[1:38:35] TexasSpades: And that’s ok to do.
[1:38:35] SilkeySmooth: blizzard wants the other guilds to catch up i say
[1:38:38] DoughBoi_Trev: We ALLLL know Ion Hazzardkostas is a liar , come on now KEKW
[1:38:40] is__nova: highly possible we are overthinking the heck out of this
[1:38:40] DropShotDrewster: La
[1:38:46] WickedWhomp: !drops
[1:38:46] tonesview4: What did you get out the vault?
[1:38:49] mozavich: back in MY DAAAAAAAY, we spent 28 hours on Ragnaros in a single day! the kids these days ;)
[1:38:49] Felric_DH: but to have all of that in week 1 and to clear hardest content is not appealing
[1:39:03] tonesview4: !drops

[1:40:55] Holysal: @PrincessAww Kappa
[1:40:55] Huwerdo: What xp bar is that
[1:40:56] artiBEAST: It’s rough I think any time the race lasts past the first reset.. might be good for views but bad for the competitions perception
[1:41:00] Dcarter: They will get there but chance…..
[1:41:04] Molvonos: @Towelliee Transmog Roulette was redeemed by @Scenic_Drive_915

[4:18:06] Saucy722: I meant literally, like the pandemic ended 🤣🤣
[4:18:12] jojoman12: watching liquid was cringe, mute every 10min
[4:18:12] ZeusDNA: @Onearmyof2 They're currently over 48k right now though lol
[4:18:16] Dfinchio: Who do you think will get  world first?
[4:18:21] purfessorplum: which is weird, why all the fuss, they aren't any further ahead by doing that lols

[4:18:29] firehawk73: Free Evokers for everyone...DF trial for everyone until Jan 2
[4:18:32] Luceinn: Maybe they are feeling behind because of last teir
[4:18:50] Lostdogal: Dude the guild meetings on Echo are wild lol. Every pull they drop off for 10-15 minutes for a meeting before pulling again.
[4:19:05] MKBragg: @Towelliee numbers make sense when you take into account that Echo is coming off 2 wins in a row compared to 2 losses for Liquid, people want to watch who they think has the best chance to win
[4:19:06] ojodrd: soy

[4:19:49] PigPenLen: they all seem resigned that the kill wont happen till thursday
[4:19:50] instant_savage: but that annoying dancing guy tho
[4:19:53] Lostdogal: Yeah the race on broodkeeper was the best part so far. So close.
[4:19:54] Sulairn: frag  made a mistake switching from echo
[4:19:54] Garrek__: Liquid has great casters
[4:19:55] rimmmyjob: everytime i go to the echo stream its an anime character dancing
[4:19:58] TweektheProphet: I assume liquid went with the belif that the server would be down for the full time, they were running later then usual last night
[4:20:05] Thoreya: people roll with the winners, and also echo has a better cast
[4:20:08] Thoreya: people like the winners
[4:20:22] Onearmyof2: except the redbull one
[4:20:26] Gingerprimer: Liquid also went way over budget last time
[4:20:27] dreamwalker213: Echo also has a lot of NA casters which helps
[4:20:32] the_bad_goat: Why did they change their name from limit to liquid?

[4:22:08] Holysal: @stabzmcgeee only 2 guilds will ever win tbf
[4:22:10] DevilSpire: @towelliee I think this race wasn’t as hyped as others to be honest
[4:22:12] Gingerprimer: Yes but ECHO also has a budget
[4:22:25] Skittlebeast: all the sponsors they have
[4:22:26] jaysteea: isnt it like liquids last chance to be funded by Liquid?
[4:22:35] cazhually: damn they making bank

[4:23:25] aspiration89: @jaysteea Considering Max is part owner of liquid, I doubt that.
[4:23:29] Skittlebeast: @jaysteea lol no
[4:23:50] smashwow: @barrowzz oh you didn't get the memo. go look up the OTK drama
[4:23:50] aspiration89: @barrowzz monkaS Rich..
[4:23:55] Holysal: @barrowzz you must not know what happened to him. go look it up
[4:23:57] cazhually: kinda wierd na
[4:23:58] Bedpan_BoB: @barrowzz google it
[4:24:02] jaysteea: @jaysteea i thought there was a tweet from Steve or smthing in that way
[4:24:03] cazhually: lets starting gaming
[4:24:18] Garrek__: well it's because echo and golden guardians combine for the rwf so dratnos and tettles are part of the golden guardians/bdgg group

[4:25:30] jaysteea: Steve Arhancet is  Co-CEO and Owner
[4:25:30] Lostdogal: Rich literally caster cursed himself the minute he arrived on Echo's stream. Made a comment about waking up wondering when he was going to be fired from his own company. Literally 2 hours later....
[4:25:39] Kinghorn: steve jobs
[4:25:42] idenkaz_: but they dont get any money from actually winning its all ads, streams ect so it really doesnt matter does it?
[4:25:53] MagicMalTv: truly
[4:25:55] PigPenLen: I thought it was Bob who tweeted that shit!
[4:25:55] wEiRdO_dUdE: It will suck for Echo, but yep it could be over tonight
[4:26:19] PotbellyGoat: fewer people watch 2nd place
[4:26:25] MagicMalTv: it would be nice to see echo and liquid under one roof going at it, same resets, same starts.
[4:26:33] Ryenonn: I think its pretty easy to understand
[4:26:37] Nerdmeat_: no it was joe
[4:26:37] cazhually: i think the race to world first wouldn't be that enjoyable if echo kept winning
[4:26:39] brand0nhxc: bob the builder, no we can't build that bitch either
[4:26:39] Samiccus: Bob the builder
[4:26:40] Nerdmeat_: joe momma

[4:27:32] MagicMalTv: @Holysal it will.
[4:27:55] Gingerprimer: @Towelliee TL spent about 25K each day in SOFO and they said they went about doublle the budget they expected in SOFO
[4:27:58] Holysal: @MagicMalTv nope. scripe and max dont like each other. it wont happen

[4:29:26] Holysal: @MagicMalTv well only way it would happen is blizzard takes control of it. they players dont want blizzard in charge
[4:29:32] Gingerprimer: Yeah pretty sure they applied a stealth nerf
[4:29:36] aidonn: i stopped doing rares after getting 380 ilvl only got like 370 items so could not be bothered
