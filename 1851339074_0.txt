[6:12:15] shawty918: Hello all! New to watching WoW streams. Played very briefly from WoD through shadowlands and stopped playing a while ago. Is this "classic" content?
[6:12:31] StreamElements: Redeem Points at point store https://streamelements.com/swifty/store
[6:12:39] Galdrena: yes it's Wrath of the Lich King classic @shawty918
[6:12:43] JESSIEJR: @shawty918 WOTLK yes
[6:12:43] au_chilli: Yah, this is classic
[6:12:46] Tomoglaziat: its wrath
[6:12:47] theroguecyclist: @shawty918 classin WLK
[6:13:04] UndeadKillerTBC: Times changed SMOrc
[6:13:09] au_chilli: Yah, classic WotLK
[6:13:22] shawty918: Worth getting back into WoW with this classic content, or not really?
[6:14:10] JESSIEJR: @shawty918 only you can find that answer tbh by trying it out. Else it's good old wow nothing changed
[6:14:23] shawty918: Feels like I didn't really get the best thay WoW had to offer playing for the period that I did?
[6:14:48] UndeadKillerTBC: is this ptr?
[6:14:54] Galdrena: no
[6:15:19] UndeadKillerTBC: eu servers down Sadge
[6:15:49] JESSIEJR: @shawty918 Well if you have never , then you should try it out at least a month then.
[6:16:15] JESSIEJR: Way different than Retail or WOD-Shadowlands so
[6:16:59] Rockhound2006: @Swifty wich emblems do we get now in the beta dungeons ?
[6:17:11] UndeadKillerTBC: i feels like classic is harder to get into than retail because the community is really minmaxy
[6:17:17] SCHLEMM: gaming house 3.0?
[6:17:36] Galdrena: gaming house 3.0 came and went
[6:17:40] shawty918: @swifty I was not playing WOW during vanilla-WOTLK and didn't get into WOW until WoD and quit in shadowlands. Wondering if giving a shot to classic content was worth it
[6:18:06] Ackhy: Will you play the Hardcore PTR?

[7:09:28] Toiarc: Hi swifty. I hope you dont get mad but I suggest you get Auctionator as auction house addon. It works in wotlk. Wotlk version has different layout than retail screenshots seen in curse website but works quite well. You can search by keyword and then it gives list with every item that has same keyword with price, and then you click one and can see all entries.
[7:09:36] JESSIEJR: it's *** all
[7:09:51] Galdrena: both probably lol
[7:11:04] Toiarc: I just use it to buy items and not sell.

[9:33:33] Rephlect: on the web page
[9:34:03] NighthellerMLG: Yeah I had that but I don’t think it’s worth it because you might want to use that second ebeleshment on your ring
[9:34:08] NighthellerMLG: and your feet
[9:34:14] Decaou: that is strong vs rogues and ferals. the dot triggers while stealthed
[9:34:18] NighthellerMLG: For pvp ofc
[9:35:12] NighthellerMLG: Stay priority
[9:35:18] NighthellerMLG: And I put a blue silk on it
[9:35:29] NighthellerMLG: Increasing your mastery above 90%
[9:35:40] rdmr13: fury is really op bro
[9:36:01] StreamElements: Type !points to see how many points you have!
[9:36:03] NighthellerMLG: No increases your mastery above 90% health
[9:36:47] NighthellerMLG: Look up blue silk in the auction house
[9:36:55] NighthellerMLG: you attach it when you craft the ring
[9:38:29] NighthellerMLG: So it would be +729. Mastery +729 versatile and the blue silk will beat 380+ mastery above 90% health at 450 Ivl
[9:38:38] NighthellerMLG: but that’s if you want mastery
[9:39:13] NighthellerMLG: as a arms warrior I love being a full mastery but  some people like other stats so
[9:39:22] NighthellerMLG: I love 200k+ mortals
[9:40:00] phutureee: You dont anymore
