[0:38:26] Finiin: yes
[0:38:26] Difflect: they release any of the other classes/ specs yet?
[0:38:28] Mr_Pennywise_: yes
[0:38:34] NewWorldReign: you guys think there will be mroe races/classes that Blizzard will conjure up in the future?
[0:39:09] Finiin: @NewWorldReign I hope so, would love to be a NE Pally
[0:39:28] Difflect: I wanna see how bad warrior will be
[0:39:30] NewWorldReign: Undead Paladins fucking bring it
[0:39:53] Mr_Pennywise_: lol
[0:39:57] Artful_Dodger: Would the drakthyr be playable a few weeks before the expansion like demon hunters were?
[0:39:57] Finiin: @NewWorldReign ohhh yea undead pally would be cool
[0:40:35] lokiemkcuf: oh damn light raised undead paladin when?
[0:40:52] Finiin: I'm going to guess yes, part of prepatch most likely
[0:41:10] v4mp1r3slayer84: Naga to Alliance and Ogre to Horde?
[0:41:18] NewWorldReign: yeah with calia menethil as the undead leader, why not
[0:41:23] Artful_Dodger: That makes sense. I think their starting zone is separate.
[0:41:43] Difflect: if you can have an undead priest a pally seems logical
[0:42:21] Artful_Dodger: Evil priest. Anti paladin.

[0:42:53] TheSmuggledBudgie: Undead paladin would look sick.
[0:43:18] Odinslayer: preach got alpha lol
[0:43:29] Artful_Dodger: He did indeed.
[0:43:31] Tr1ckrTreat: its stream starting?

[0:57:14] tyler2tall89: alpha!! yes!
[0:57:16] WestonTeli: i've never played monk but was planning doing it for DF, just waiting for talent tree
[0:57:21] net_mi: BM got some boost, that's nice
[0:57:25] raye_gaming22: Bm is a spec for special raiders
[0:57:33] Finiin: I loved MM in legion, but then they changed the way it plays and I just didn't like it
[0:57:36] wEiRdO_dUdE: I think it's fine that some specs are easier than others, yeah
[0:57:41] ventu105: @chizu_gaming lol
[0:58:12] ventu105: @chizu_gaming I change from feral to BM got tire of a hard spec lol
[0:58:14] wEiRdO_dUdE: It got silly in TBC when hunters could macro their whole rotation into one button, now that was too easy
[0:58:22] Blas0n: @Towelliee GOOD MORNING!!!!!!!! How you doing!!!
[0:58:29] ventu105: but now I think going rogue or warrior
[0:58:37] Finiin: I main BM, I like it cause of the ease of farming and soloing stuff
[0:58:45] ventu105: @Blas0n morning
[0:58:50] Varsader: play ele sham go brr
[0:58:54] NickLeonhearth: @chizu_gaming damn you hating on bm
[0:58:58] ventu105: @Finiin truth

[0:59:07] WestonTeli: lock*
[0:59:07] Alvari: morning voice
[0:59:21] ventu105: @CloudierCloud and warrior arms?
[0:59:40] Gezber: no way
[0:59:41] WestonTeli: i wasn't answering lol
[0:59:41] Deathlord_Deathvoid: If we do not like the ingame UI are we still able to use things such as Bartender?
[0:59:49] holiweird: @ventu105 warrior dps is not any more complicated than BM
[0:59:50] net_mi: I wonder if blizz has thought about making wow-gold into crypto
[0:59:55] wEiRdO_dUdE: How many yards is that?
[0:59:57] holiweird: especially fury
[1:00:04] Clucky2988: can you get stunned while doing that?
[1:00:06] wEiRdO_dUdE: Was that 30?
[1:00:07] strchsr: @Towelliee Blue build kinda funny, you like weave 2 Azure Strikes between other abilities to fish for procs lol
[1:00:08] Nezurath: all the yards
[1:00:09] jeflag: can u cancel that mid flight?
[1:00:11] ventu105: @Ogidormu cool but isz a good dps?
[1:00:16] raye_gaming22: having full uptime while moving with zero punishment has to be toned down like it is in SL you cant have that bieng a vaible spec i hope they keep the trend in DF
[1:00:22] Blas0n: yeah its kinda unreal for pvp

[1:03:50] Wolfenhoof: @Varsader Because BM is fun and has the advantage that you can play it as a glorious tauren.
[1:03:55] wEiRdO_dUdE: I think it is death's advance for the DK, yeah

[1:10:35] NickLeonhearth: @eagleheart76 no
[1:10:51] eagleheart76: It has been a long while since I have had my WoW account active. What is that skin he has on?

[1:11:28] Finiin: @eagleheart76 it's not a skin, it's the new Envoker class
[1:11:40] Deathlord_Deathvoid: For reference, Battle for Azeroth launched in August 2018 while Shadowlands arrived in November 2020. So Dragonflight's release on or before December 31, 2022, is spot on.

[1:14:17] Wolfenhoof: Ion also said SL was released exactly as it was planned and that nothing was cut out, so we will see what the furture brings Kappa
[1:14:25] Darzetti_: yea just have to wait and see what happens
[1:14:27] Wolfenhoof: -r
[1:14:37] strchsr: @Towelliee Having not been in an Alpha before, how long do they usually last? 6 weeks?
[1:14:51] h_u_r_k_: is alpha in a good position right now?
[1:15:14] Regadar: @Towelliee Will you be playing Wotlk
[1:15:29] Darzetti_: I think Nov 22 would be nice
[1:15:44] szble: with no delays yeah
[1:15:45] Moobot: Plans for WOTLK Beta. Some simple leveling and helping Blizzard test. At first there won't be a lot of people to do content with. That will change when 80 Template comes into play. OH and I don't have Beta keys ask Panda
[1:15:45] wEiRdO_dUdE: Yeah they were saying this alpha was simply opened up later

[1:17:07] net_mi: Has blizz mentioned what they wanna do with classic after wotlk?
[1:17:22] Funderik: so far i feel it's the most complete alpha we've had in awhile maybe even ever.
[1:17:24] ventu105: @net_mi cata
[1:17:41] hmchammer: are you max level now @Towelliee ?
[1:18:10] wEiRdO_dUdE: If prepatch is mostly to level Evoker and get some professions started, 2 weeks could be fine

[1:18:51] magakigr: classic should end with wrath, they can do seasons after that if they want to spice things up
[1:18:59] Molvonos: Start up your Tanking Patreon
[1:19:04] looney199725: tanks and healers are low in retail so only imagine how rough alpha is
[1:19:08] szble: tumbleweeds flyin
[1:19:08] strchsr: @Towelliee I just realized that Evoker is basically a Death Knight if it was a caster/healer where they use Essence for their abilities, like DKs have Runes
[1:19:10] kimmo_gaming: Morning big man, i see yard is coming along good
[1:19:24] DAN_I_E_L_: Just start over again
[1:19:26] WestonTeli: "classic" era ended with LFR
[1:19:30] DAN_I_E_L_: or classic+
[1:20:02] crackmonitor: its weird because i dont want cata, but i do want Mop
[1:20:02] Finiin: they updated the eye for LFG?
[1:20:05] szble: so with dragon soul?
[1:20:09] emznev: Cata will happen calling it now
[1:20:10] Molvonos: Fucking laaaate
[1:20:21] Molvonos: like 2:30amish
[1:20:38] Molvonos: Playing an Among Us like game: Goose, Goose, Duck.
[1:21:56] WestonTeli: i don't think cata would happen. the whole arguement for classic from blizz's view was the old world
[1:21:58] ravensky93: good morning Towelliee peepoHappy
[1:22:06] wEiRdO_dUdE: Some people really want to see a Cataclysm Classic (mostly PvP people), but it makes sense to do a full Classic progression anyway, I think
[1:22:06] h_u_r_k_: @emznev cata isnt classic tho
[1:22:13] Clicklesly: That's Preach ^^
[1:22:42] NickLeonhearth: @h_u_r_k_ what does cata isnt classic mean lol
[1:22:49] baaronthemonk: tell them to release monk stuff and let me in and I'll tank :P
[1:22:49] tyler2tall89: ill tryi out my Blood DK if i get one
[1:22:52] Dafinchi: send me an invite I'll tank all day lol.  TFA alpha invites to randoms, let's go.
[1:22:57] tyler2tall89: give me a key blizzard!
[1:22:59] emznev: @h_u_r_k_ I never said it was still classic lol
[1:23:00] jetributions: well if they give us vengance dh i will be testing that out
[1:23:03] GamertagTIKI: i would tank ....thats all i want to do
[1:23:17] emznev: @h_u_r_k_ does not mean they wont do it
[1:23:28] ShadoodHD: i can heal/tank if needed... and if i get the invite too towCopium
[1:23:35] Gezber: doesn't help that only two tank specs have new talents
[1:23:50] lithium364: call sloot to wake up
[1:23:59] luckfore: preach said no ty
[1:24:11] rick_morks: Preach doesnt want to play with other streamers
[1:24:33] Kaype92: Aww why did preach leave?
[1:24:41] Finiin: I've never tanked, but would like to try, but i'd get to worried about messing yp to much
[1:24:43] sinetybrit: no he doesnt want to play with towlie for slagging of his community (and i quote that..)
[1:25:00] GamertagTIKI: how does guardian feel?
[1:25:02] WestonTeli: he doesn't want his hair to be compared with actual hair LUL

[1:25:55] GamertagTIKI: Really gonna miss Ravenous Frenzy....lol

[1:30:00] looney199725: he was streaming yesterday with soda for OTK content hes busy
[1:30:05] truman0725: I love asmon but his community is sooooo toxic
[1:30:05] Molvonos: @net_mi Politics take stage left here, keep it chill.
[1:30:08] crackmonitor: asmon has the same prob that blizz has, their audience
[1:30:11] wEiRdO_dUdE: Yeah, Asmon does what he wants to do, and he can do anything he wants, he's fine
[1:30:32] thunder993: Imagine 60k people screeching that stuff every day at him
[1:30:38] Brerathiel: Towelliee just how good is the new UI configuration Blizzard have introduced?
[1:30:41] Funderik: to be honest, this only started once he decided to play ff14, it was fine before, not saying ff14 is the problem, i'm saying it's where it started.
[1:30:46] looney199725: people are just freaks and think they own some streamers haha
[1:30:50] jeflag: asmon take a break for detoxifying
[1:31:07] Molvonos: Asmon kinda fostered his community to the toxic nest it is now.

[1:32:11] aysenree: They are extremely toxic
[1:32:16] looney199725: wow are the toxic ppl
[1:32:26] looney199725: ye thats the fact
[1:32:26] nchester51: big facts
[1:32:26] kimmo_gaming: Yes
[1:32:27] Immhey: Streamers played into MMO tribalism and are surprised MMO tribalism is a problem lul
[1:32:28] szble: oh they are not saints
[1:32:31] looney199725: they want you to quit cuz they quit
[1:32:37] Elseworldz: What do you mean "YOU PEOPLE?!" KappaHD
[1:32:37] aysenree: FFXIV players are extremely toxic people, say the main story quest is bad and see how upset they get
[1:32:45] thunder993: it's both, there is Kpop stan ff community as well
[1:32:48] Funderik: it's true, it's like they need the validation for leaving wow and everyone that still plays is betraying their choice.
[1:32:49] ioncomputer: @towelliee hey ur talking about me bud
[1:33:05] Wolfenhoof: so in the end all is like it ever was, the real dickheads are bred by and in WoW ^^
[1:33:09] looney199725: wow is toxic period

[1:33:42] Kirof2102: @looney199725 nah like any other mmo
[1:33:42] piediddly: it's people who attach their own personalities to a streamer. Then when their favorite streamers plays something else, they take it as a personal attack on them

[1:34:24] Zettabyte: Ubisoft? Wrong, NCSoft lol
[1:34:25] aysenree: FF community is much worse than Wow
[1:34:32] Blas0n: Is Guardian druid like the old Legion moon bear? in DF
[1:34:36] Syllvn: @aysenree whut
[1:34:37] Funderik: wouldn't be cool if blizzard gave players a little something for testing beta/alphas, like play x hours or report x bugs and get a mog/title/pet/mount reward for live game.
[1:34:42] Molvonos: @bozo_85 Yea, no.  Every single community has toxicity and  the worst thing you can do is have this 'Us vs. Them' mentality as far as toxicity is concerned
[1:34:46] TheCakeBadger: They are not toxic. They just care more deeply about furry things Kappa
[1:34:46] Zettabyte: @Zettabyte xD
[1:34:52] Chiraakitteh: Ubisoft? The wild star IP is owned my NCSOFT
[1:34:55] Chiraakitteh: by*
[1:35:03] aysenree: There is no free speech in FF.
[1:35:06] botscast: thats what happens when u give alpha to 3 people ;d
[1:35:13] wEiRdO_dUdE: There is some real tribalism with video games, sure
[1:35:15] Zettabyte: @Chiraakitteh Yes, I corrected myself if you cought it :)
[1:35:17] looney199725: @Towelliee did you see the new cough leak saying we will be time traveling alot this expac to try stop some events
[1:35:22] thunder993: @funderik Bad idea, people would report stuff that isn't bugs just to farm mount
[1:35:26] Toxarina: Toxarina subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 78 months! 
[1:35:32] BaldBroGaming: Title or tabard or something would be cool.
[1:35:34] nchester51: seems unfair to all the ppl who dont get invited :(
[1:35:39] TheCakeBadger: or if your input is of use, kind of thing
[1:35:50] Ezekyler: Blizzard gave an achievment for Diablo 3 beta and was a shitshow @Towelliee
[1:35:54] Toxarina: towHAMUP towHAMUP towHAMUP towHAMUP towHAMUP towHAMUP
[1:35:56] Funderik: @thunder993 it's filtered out on blizzards end. they will know the fake from real.
[1:36:01] nezzorztv: what ilvl is the new raid (mythic)
[1:36:01] ioncomputer: Cause it would be free and they hate free stuff
[1:36:07] ShadoodHD: that's going to be the fucking yeti if they do that for DF KEKW
[1:36:14] looney199725: can i have permission to send a link?
[1:36:18] Agronair: Your compensation for testing alpha/beta is getting to play alpha/beta
[1:36:19] looney199725: its about a DF info
[1:36:30] wEiRdO_dUdE: Yeah I would think achievements for limited access things would be bad overall

[1:37:30] Chiraakitteh: Frankly everyone who wants to play alpha would just burn themselves out on it earlier...
[1:37:33] WestonTeli: oh god, i'm coming back to wow.  monkaS
[1:37:37] Animemron: Wouldnt be fair to those who dont get invited tho. Then it would have to be everyone.
[1:37:38] tankabito: When they ignored all feedback in the past why bother
[1:37:39] Funderik: @Agronair that's not how it works, beta isn't content for you to waste time on. it's not a reward, it's for testing.
[1:37:40] Finiin: which tank would be good for someone who's never tanked before to level and play?
[1:37:41] NickLeonhearth: i never download the beta, and i get it every xpack
[1:37:48] looney199725: we time traveling now
[1:37:49] Xerati404: 2 dungeons out?
[1:37:49] baaronthemonk: think about how much gold and progress you are giving up on live if you are truly working to help out on beta or alpha
[1:37:53] thunder993: I don't play when I get beta either, don't like playing buggy content and don't want to spoil myself
[1:38:10] Chiraakitteh: Towellie is different ... LUL
[1:38:33] Elseworldz: What I REALLY want is pre patch so I can fiddle with talents and try them out in-game.
[1:38:43] ObamaEnvy: who?
[1:38:57] ShadoodHD: healforweed KEKW
[1:39:22] Agronair: Honestly wish I could get into the alpha, so that I can test Shaman tree stuff.
[1:39:27] Angxlic: if you are a CE player you have a higher chance of getting invited or specifically Shade on illidan?

[1:40:58] looney199725: blizz said no alpha for you this expac
[1:41:14] Dystilled: Probably trying to force people to try different specs

[1:41:32] Blas0n: Mythic raiding about to be lit
[1:41:32] wEiRdO_dUdE: The potential of professions is awesome, that's why they are scared that people will gear up too much with it and are trying to limit crafted pieces worn to 5
[1:41:40] WestonTeli: no power grind
[1:41:47] Syprus1: are the nameplate option improved or we still gonna need plater addon

[1:44:05] rei__03: hey haven;t been around for some blood dk content, how does it feel? @Towelliee
[1:44:18] looney199725: they are done making the game for 60 ppl
[1:44:20] Gezber: @Alaquane yes, all shaman talents are out
[1:44:24] jhajden: if you need a dps petko is looking for a group
[1:44:26] xaeblue: they should make two separate raids for rwf and for everyone else. I mean they already had to nerf the last one into the ground
[1:44:30] xhaven: I like the RWF though hope they dont mess itup somehow
[1:44:31] Blas0n: @looney199725 good good
[1:44:52] Blas0n: True @Towelliee
[1:44:56] looney199725: honeslty for those WF raiders now there is still hardmode content
[1:44:57] syngred1: inb4 next race is gonna be so easy
[1:45:00] syngred1: echo deletes it in 2 days
[1:45:02] looney199725: m+ 30s and so on still a thing
[1:45:13] JellonaCub: does brewmastef feel bad at start with less agi/stagger?
[1:45:19] looney199725: so if they want to rly test themselves m+ will still be there
[1:45:30] dwolters_the_zombieman: what weapons can drakthyr use
[1:45:51] Blas0n: @Towelliee Enjoying the early morning content. Leaning back drinking coffee watching the best streamer around
[1:45:58] NickLeonhearth: how long was it?
[1:46:05] looney199725: it killed so many guilds
[1:46:08] jetributions: hopefully we get 2 more dungeons and a few more classes to test in next build
[1:46:09] looney199725: it killed top 5 guilds too
[1:46:37] Blas0n: yeah tons guilds come back in Dragonflight
[1:46:43] Elseworldz: I'm glad it didn't kill MY guild. But we don't do mythic, we're not masochists.

[1:46:51] tankabito: wheres that copium graphic
[1:46:52] xhaven: what would be cool is if blizzz give a raid like the last one maybe once an xpac or so for RWF
[1:46:53] syngred1: It's actually crazy how many times they nerfed sepulcher
[1:46:58] wEiRdO_dUdE: Consistency is good, yeah
[1:46:59] Blas0n: I already have a huge list of players who quit during SoD and early SFO that want to come back to raiding in DF
[1:47:03] skilled_fragi: is there a stat and dmg squish for dragonflight expansion like last 2 expansions or not ?
[1:47:06] syngred1: its insane echo managed to kill those bosses with that gear and considering all pre nerf
[1:47:08] truman0725: sofo is good but a bit overtuned imo
[1:47:09] NickLeonhearth: So no more 20 min Sha of Fear fights?
[1:47:16] Finiin: I miss the mini raids, the one's where they'd have 2 or 3 bosses
[1:47:30] crackmonitor: i prefer harder raids
[1:47:33] looney199725: i took a break after CN came back for sep
[1:47:54] Blas0n: Anduin was a mental boomer no cap
[1:48:17] looney199725: everyone wants to be back till they play
[1:48:21] zarenadt: BfA raid pacing/delivery was good with the small raid inbetween
[1:48:24] Scoodles91: first tier everybody wants raid
[1:48:33] Scoodles91: even pvp-ers
[1:48:44] Blas0n: yep
[1:48:44] looney199725: tbh nyalotha was rly bad end expac raid
[1:48:46] looney199725: it was to easy
[1:48:48] looney199725: nya was a joke
[1:48:54] looney199725: nzoth was such a bad end boss
[1:48:55] epikouros_kathigitis: @Towelliee druid will be really bad in DF too.. no point spending even 2 mins for testing him
[1:49:16] jetributions: if you got room i can help out
[1:49:26] Murderingz: guys I just got here, did we go over the hunter changes alrdy?
[1:49:28] aMoteofCosmicTruth: OK_DUD_LISSEN subscribed with Prime. 
[1:49:31] wEiRdO_dUdE: Could always go feral dps LUL
[1:49:35] jetributions: dps
[1:50:36] wEiRdO_dUdE: I think it's good that they have been making changes for hunter talents
[1:50:42] looney199725: i think everyone would prefer 5-6 min boss fights that are action packed than sleepers that are 12 mins were you afk
[1:50:46] truman0725: which is a shame because player numbers could have gone through the roof if it was good enough
[1:50:47] xReadyAimMissx: morning Towelliee and chat chevHAPPY burkeWave
[1:50:56] Blas0n: @looney199725 agreed
[1:51:02] DizzyJVD: good way to blame their below average work on something else
[1:51:10] WestonTeli: @truman0725 eh the systems made me leave month one LUL
[1:51:39] truman0725: @CloudierCloud yeah exactly my point, covid was an awesome chance to get many players to return
[1:51:45] Blas0n: @Towelliee NOW YOUR PREACHING BROTHER
[1:51:49] Blas0n: Thank GOD!!!!!
[1:51:50] xhaven: @DizzyJVD covid affected the entire world..I think they were justified
[1:51:52] Blas0n: yes man!!!! yes
[1:51:54] NickLeonhearth: @Towelliee Blackhand mythic POG
[1:51:55] looney199725: just have every 2 mins it goes even more crazy
[1:52:04] lithium364: sylvanas slootKEKW
[1:52:20] jeflag: based on my personal experience, 3mins is enough to satisfy a person
[1:52:25] syngred1: I mean they deleted the fight.
[1:52:25] Triist0ne: yeah jailer is a joke
[1:52:27] Triist0ne: now
[1:52:29] syngred1: itst oo much
[1:52:30] Khandak: Ashvane phase 2 was boring af
[1:52:39] CodeMasterr: @pocketjs same bro same
[1:52:51] elizondria: Sylv was a really bad fight for "her lore" too though. Like, it feels so much like just an excuse for doing a fight they wanted to 'show the action' for the end cinematic.
[1:52:55] Khandak: *Sylvannas
[1:53:15] cptrogers123: Levelling is soo fast now. It takes like 2 hours to get level 40
[1:53:25] Blas0n: Fights like Rygelon are more exciting then Mythic Jailer honestly
[1:53:31] looney199725: nzoth was also garbo you would be afk waiting cuz you blasted all the tentis and you had nothing to hit
[1:53:37] SirVoro: what is the eye in the bottom right near the bags?
[1:53:40] Blas0n: yeah Phase 1 is the hardest
[1:53:44] ElDrakenMan: @towelliee do you know tank your going to have to raid with in DF or to soon to tell still?
[1:53:45] SirVoro: Oh thats the que eye PogChamp I Like that
[1:53:48] smol_gunner: aside maybe few cool fights, imo this expansion raids were complete garbage
[1:53:48] syngred1: blackhand myth best fight
[1:53:50] xhaven: @innerkind thanks I totally forgot I wanted to level a few toons!
[1:53:55] syngred1: perma action start to finish for 9 mins
[1:54:06] cptrogers123: @xhaven its fucking fast maqte
[1:54:08] cptrogers123: mate
[1:54:17] ChuckyG0: @Jasondelco yeah, it more draconic right now :P
[1:54:18] Blas0n: i hope its Prot Warrior
[1:54:24] Mockle: @smoltankz nathria is widely considered one of the best raids ever
[1:54:26] CodeMasterr: LUL
[1:54:27] lithium364: prot pala no bounce cap on shield in dk Copium
[1:54:33] lithium364: *df
[1:54:41] wEiRdO_dUdE: Prot warrior could be the ticket this time, we have to see the trees
[1:54:58] looney199725: prot warrior is kinda broken from datamining you can give 4 other ppl your shield wall
[1:54:59] Wolfenhoof: catJAM
[1:55:03] xReadyAimMissx: danPanic
[1:55:04] smol_gunner: @smoltankz CN had cool bosses, but overall its just meh
[1:55:07] kimmo_gaming: BA BA BA BAAAAAAAAAAAA
[1:55:09] Blas0n: @looney199725 yeah looks very strong
[1:55:13] Elseworldz: and then the dps forgets to click ready
[1:55:16] Blas0n: it has 2 charges also now
[1:55:43] Tia214: oof
[1:55:44] AveragePvp: AveragePvp subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 4 months! 
[1:55:48] xReadyAimMissx: it was happening until it wasn't. Pepehand
[1:56:13] looney199725: it really depends if the raid is super physical or magic dmg
[1:56:14] The13Legion: Towelliee how fun are the gold sellers in the alpha this time ? :D
[1:56:18] Rygothx: Any datamined info about VDH yet?
[1:56:19] looney199725: if its physical youll see warrior
[1:56:28] ninetysix: y is prot busted ?
[1:56:32] looney199725: dh has no info
[1:56:32] PToastman: yet Kappa
[1:56:34] DAN_I_E_L_: Just ignore what the lfg tool is saying. It happens on live as well.
[1:56:52] wEiRdO_dUdE: We're in the dungeon!!
[1:56:54] RealMelorandor: Why does WoW live rent free in people that have said they sworn off WoW and quit?
[1:56:59] Blas0n: @ninetysix Shield wall can go to your party now and it has 2 charges and also rend applies to all targetss that are hit by thunderclap.
[1:57:24] looney199725: prot warrior will be m+ meta again

[1:57:46] Rygothx: @ninetysix where did you guys see/read this info from?
[1:57:53] PToastman: even Lirik is back every expansion
[1:57:53] Blas0n: might even be best raid tank also with Rally and shield wall for tank soaks
[1:57:55] looney199725: wowhead
[1:57:56] Elseworldz: mmo champion is fully of morons imo
[1:57:58] looney199725: made a post awhile ago
[1:58:03] theNebuchadnezzar: LOL true
[1:58:08] RealMelorandor: Yeah I am not trying to shit on certain people (talking about certain streamers too) that will shit on people that still play WoW but it like...Lives rent free in their mind LOL
[1:58:19] Friberg: are UI changes account wide?
[1:58:26] WestonTeli: every expansion since wod you mean LUL
[1:58:37] theNebuchadnezzar: @Friberg no create profiles
[1:58:39] looney199725: people just want them to do what they do
[1:58:42] tyler2tall89: can you move the dmg meter to where we can see it? id like to see th einvoker dps compaired to others
[1:58:47] B3rgh: All expansions are great for the first month regardless of how bad the game is overall, i always enjoy the prep for the first raid :)
[1:58:54] looney199725: thats why when preach said he isnt covering wow content now he is steaming it he got so much shit
[1:59:09] Cakeabsorber: Expansion honeymoon phases are the best
[1:59:11] wEiRdO_dUdE: @tyler2tall89 I don't think damage meters work in the alpha
[1:59:30] looney199725: people got that mindset of i think game is shit so should you
[1:59:33] Blas0n: regardless no game comes close to WoW when it comes to M+ and Raiding its just facts
[1:59:37] Wolfenhoof: @piytu104 i would have done this as well, but i am tauren addicted :/  still never played lesser in any expansion, good thing is, it can't get worse once the bottom is hit
[1:59:51] szble: yeah beginning is fun
[2:00:04] theNebuchadnezzar: @piytu104 I need to know why you thin SL is so bad minus the small about of content? the borrowed power was done pretty well, harder end game content was hard and kept the real community coming back (even tho SEP was hard af) ? was is alts ? or just trendy to quit wow?
[2:00:05] looney199725: eh m+ is deffo the best thing to happen to wow in awhile
[2:00:17] Elseworldz: Yup honeymoon phases for mmos are good. That's why I only play ff14 in the first month or 2, then come back for the expansion launch.
[2:00:22] Immhey: What makes or breaks a WoW xpac is not system or design. It's the content schedule.
[2:00:30] RealMelorandor: Just funny Youtube personalities and streamers will be like WoW players have copium but won't stop talking about WoW like FR
[2:00:30] looney199725: the start of sl was bad bro
[2:00:32] Screamnsteam: KEKW
[2:00:34] looney199725: im sorry sl was bad
[2:00:41] looney199725: most top end players will also tell you sl was bad
[2:00:45] ElDrakenMan: I love the event of an expansion. Watching 24/7 towelliee get sock on head, snack bin goodness and new content
[2:00:46] theNebuchadnezzar: SL was deff better than BFA in how power ande content was organized
[2:00:51] Blas0n: @looney199725 idk man ... Castle nathria raid was lit
[2:00:58] Sionz: The tone of the Dev's is different when they talk about DragonFlight
[2:01:01] ence_nel_blu: I hope they don't add some shit system
[2:01:01] looney199725: the raid was gd
[2:01:08] looney199725: but coven logs were garbo
[2:01:18] haalxd: Is Well Honed Instincts still bugged?

[2:01:20] looney199725: cn was the best raid of this whole expac id argue
[2:01:22] SpoofAvatar: not enough evokers
[2:01:24] Blas0n: the good ole rip cord
[2:01:31] DeanoTV: @ence_nel_blu they confirmed no new systems, just new talent trees and new profession stuff
[2:02:06] looney199725: fun fact one of the devs mentioned future systems haha
[2:02:19] WestonTeli: that's a sick looking boss
[2:02:19] Moobot: Plans for WOTLK Beta. Some simple leveling and helping Blizzard test. At first there won't be a lot of people to do content with. That will change when 80 Template comes into play. OH and I don't have Beta keys ask Panda
[2:02:34] looney199725: new talent revamp has future systems in mind apar
[2:02:40] tyra_dk: Hey Towelliee, how's the alpha going in Dragonflight?
[2:02:44] wEiRdO_dUdE: EZ
[2:03:04] Fyeah: @looney199725 who said that
[2:03:19] Elseworldz: @looney199725 He said the word system, GET HIM!
[2:03:33] looney199725: it was in that morgan day interview thing
[2:03:39] looney199725: he used the word systems
[2:03:49] Wolfenhoof: he should get fired
[2:04:02] adsgg3: you will see the system last week of  beta not alpha probs LUL
[2:04:08] looney199725: also
[2:04:20] Blas0n: @Calibuds3 naw.. This time BLizzard is different
[2:04:21] looney199725: out of no where theres a new DF feature called grand adventure :)
[2:04:22] DizzyJVD: lastnights bear tank was getting destroyed, what's the difference between you and him??
[2:04:25] Blas0n: Trust me BLizzard learned from SL
[2:04:39] Gezber: brambles already kinda does it, no?
[2:04:43] Elseworldz: @Calibuds3 COPIUM
[2:04:44] Wolfenhoof: @Blas0n People was saying the same about BfA.
[2:04:57] SpoofAvatar: a thorns type active mitigation
[2:05:23] looney199725: i aint gonna judge DF till beta is fully done and we see the final day 1 balance changes for live
[2:05:26] adsgg3: just saying there is no content atm other then do dungs raid and some mediocre flying. i got a feeling something is brewing for the beta but i hope not lool
[2:05:38] Wolfenhoof: And Ion says the "we've learned from..." after and before every fucking new expansion, so i would be careful on that thingy.
[2:05:45] looney199725: those are not the only things
[2:05:48] Gezber: there's one for barkskin
[2:05:48] RealMelorandor: Has any music/Soundtrack relating to Dragonflight been released yet or?
[2:05:53] looney199725: they just announced grand adventures system
[2:05:55] SirVoro: The new default UI is so clean
[2:06:04] SirVoro: the customizations on it too CRISP
[2:06:06] wEiRdO_dUdE: WIth brambles, when you hit barkskin it starts AoE damage
[2:06:09] Fyeah: that would probably be a cosmetic thing bro
[2:06:10] looney199725: https://www.wowhead.com/news/grand-adventure-time-features-new-maps-depicting-warcrafts-past-and-alternate-327735?webhook
[2:06:16] looney199725: this is a new DF feature also
[2:06:20] Fyeah: which doesnt  affect anything to be fair
[2:06:40] Wolfenhoof: Blizzard gave the word system a bad name, thats for sure.
[2:06:51] DeanoTV: thats speculation
[2:06:53] cptrogers123: My favourite zone is deff Hellfire peninsula
[2:06:53] looney199725: systems can be good
[2:07:00] looney199725: if they didnt throw them away
[2:07:08] RealMelorandor: realMelorandor subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 5 months, currently on a 1 month streak! 
[2:07:53] Fyeah: well they literally have said over and over past few weeks that they dont wanna add any system that comes with player power idk
[2:07:55] holiweird: @Towelliee Which class would you suggest for a new tank?
[2:08:00] hasan666: Fireboi
[2:08:14] Immhey: People really exaggerate the good and bad of each expansion.  You play the same thing at its core which is raid, dungeon, pvp. If you like then then good if you dont then it wont change
[2:08:24] Holysal: @Ogidormu bear
[2:08:25] Blas0n: @Ogidormu Guardian druid XD
[2:08:50] holiweird: okiii :D
[2:08:56] looney199725: if anyone should be complaining its the pvpers
[2:09:04] looney199725: pvpers get shafted every expac
[2:09:06] tobbs94: surely these bosses will get hard mechanics on mythic or
[2:09:12] xReadyAimMissx: is being a panda close enough? burkeKek
[2:09:15] RealMelorandor: What do you think about the Kul Tiran allied race?
[2:09:23] Wolfenhoof: @looney199725 who is playing mainly pvp in wow WANTS to suffer
[2:09:27] DickyV02: is the new healer class in the alpha? i dont know anything about it really
[2:09:41] FrankTizzle: Ashran 2.0 Kappa
[2:09:51] RealMelorandor: Lol Knock Ups
[2:09:54] almostdps: so every class is equal to rogues now
[2:09:56] looney199725: ye its filthy
[2:09:57] SpoofAvatar: massive CC
[2:10:02] lithium364: only the mad alpha testers already making yt videos of evoker should be banned in ranked pvp lol
[2:10:05] Holysal: lost ark pvp KEKW
[2:10:09] szble: par for the course
[2:10:09] lithium364: theres so many already
[2:10:11] ferri_agg: @almostdps KEKW
[2:10:12] aleksmetha: i wanna dat glad mount soooo bad
[2:10:12] Blas0n: They should just have a Spereate server for PVP without any PVE stuff and things
[2:10:13] Djfarmville: @percycaria Cause we dont have their tree?
[2:10:14] RealMelorandor: When I played Mage back in MoP/WoD I loved to knock up people, especially in Ashran
[2:10:18] Blas0n: idk make a new client for pvp
[2:10:19] FrankTizzle: @lithium364 Why? It's going to be out of date soon
[2:10:26] DoubleNova: who has more stuns
[2:10:32] Koraszdormu: BEAR-ly any stuns.  Heh.  Unplanned druid joke.
[2:10:37] lithium364: @FrankTizzle i dont know overreacting andys
[2:10:48] szble: think its supposed to be more equalized again like legion
[2:10:51] hasan666: That’s a big pull
[2:10:52] vonblue: vonblue subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 14 months! 
[2:10:58] looney199725: i dont think they can make pvp worse than it is rn
[2:11:11] looney199725: you can legit play ele shaman rng lotto build either 1 shot the team or do no dmg
[2:11:11] Orcan3: Im not a pvper but id love if they added a new big battleground like Wintergrasp
[2:11:31] Holysal: @Orcan3  no new bgs i think
[2:11:32] Varsader: slot machine ele is best spec
[2:11:39] Regadar: Does not mattter how many times i hear that Grizzly Hills music it is so soothing lol
[2:11:44] aleksmetha: or they like reduce all cc effects like 50%
[2:11:47] aleksmetha: for pvp
[2:11:55] szble: oh yeah itll be interesting
[2:12:12] looney199725: everyone has alot of CC now tho so it will be balance tuning the dmg
[2:12:12] Orcan3: @Orcan3 Yeah i know, but it would be nice in a patch or whenever
[2:12:14] RealMelorandor: Towelliee how do you think Dragonflight will turn out? Good expansion or bad expansion, in your personal view?
[2:12:15] Raaeni: totems are terrible though
[2:12:15] zellyree: not much of control right now, u just die in like 3 sec xD
[2:12:17] Blas0n: extend duration of CC with envoker
[2:12:18] Immhey: lets go crazy
[2:12:27] Mojohusk: Diminishing returns maybe lol
[2:12:31] robert_332: can you go past lvl 60 now?
[2:12:35] looney199725: i think pvpers would rather a game last 2 mins than 2 seconds
[2:12:35] h_u_r_k_: giga purge
[2:12:37] lithium364: the only points for evoker right now is probably "Fly with me" in ranked bgs taking the flag carrier to places they normally cant get

[3:11:19] JBonezey: @Towelliee to Blizz "Release the trees of Monk and Warriors you cowards"
[3:11:21] looney199725: @remixonfire91 best way to level is open your wallet and click buy lvl 60 boost
[3:11:43] ijuki: For me, alpha and early beta won't help me... I am going on a month long vacation August 2nd
[3:11:44] remixonfire91: @remixonfire91 yes will surely spend 60 euros on a thing i can do for free
[3:11:46] mhunt2424: It would’ve been problem with dragons had a spec to be tank
[3:12:00] net_mi: When are we suppose to  enter beta?
[3:12:03] hikaritd: Warlocks last..... Madge
[3:12:13] szble: yeah makes sense
[3:12:13] Razmasbear: I still have my 60 boost unused from EPic DF... what class do you gyus recommend using it on? Monk Rogue or mage?
[3:12:16] br3z: yeah i really wanna see war, was considering it being my main again. like the good old days
[3:12:24] Zettabyte: That bacon sousage was epic!
[3:12:31] looney199725: @Razmasbear id wait till DF is live
[3:12:44] looney199725: condem and kyrian

[3:12:46] aleksmetha: kyrian and venthyer
[3:12:47] looney199725: @Towelliee
[3:12:49] JBonezey: I don't think Warriors will be much better. I'm leaning Druid/Monk for DF tanking
[3:12:49] br3z: they got condem n spear i think
[3:12:49] Elseworldz: @Razmasbear Yeah just wait.
[3:12:53] darthturtle1031: Have you tried survival hunter yet?
[3:12:56] looney199725: nobanner
[3:12:57] ijuki: @Razmasbear Hold on to it
[3:13:03] Zwarx32: When’s paladin
[3:13:05] Ooshraxa: @Towelliee Any predictions/Hopes for DH tank?
[3:13:15] icerasta: Spear and they made condem basically "improved execute"
[3:13:19] looney199725: kyrian for cc and condem because juggernaut is back so huge execute dmg
[3:13:30] Elseworldz: Do we know which class trees are coming out next?
[3:13:31] Razmasbear: Main is still gonna be my druid so this i'm planning to just keep as crafting /tmoghunter alt
[3:13:38] Blas0n: @ptahm0se idk.. I think warriors might be best M+ tanks with shield wall buffs and AOE rend applieed on thunderclap with no target cap
[3:13:58] Strouss: i would agree
[3:14:06] Mehlwyrm: tankdrood is just not good right now, but thats just very high keys
[3:14:09] methadonee: visage form is a human base model? blood elf? can you show us? @Towelliee
[3:14:16] wEiRdO_dUdE: Even prot warrior could do pretty much all the content in Shadowlands, yeah
[3:14:23] The_Dane_Train: Warriors need more self heal. Every other tank can top off health.
[3:14:41] ijuki: @methadonee Male => belf, female => human iirc
[3:14:42] xziyn: Most classes have been pretty good in Shadowlands honestly, baring a few exceptions
[3:14:44] RealMelorandor: Shadowlands
[3:14:54] ijuki: Rather, body 1/body 2
[3:15:13] Strouss: @The_Dane_Train  they mitigate bete then any other tank they do not need a heal..... boring if all tanks played thesame.
[3:15:27] JellonaCub: its a bit too much with the moving
[3:15:59] theagiledev: Opinions on the alpha?
[3:16:02] jkitchin75: its cool
[3:16:03] wEiRdO_dUdE: 3 hours in queue.....ouch
[3:16:15] Holysal: sloot had some issues too when he played dps
[3:16:18] Reckless_Monk: they need to add more people
[3:16:20] jaws120: tank main here. would love to try them out cus theyre the only thing i care about but didnt get lucky with alpha. @Towelliee
[3:16:21] ShadoodHD: that's what i'm saying, it's kinda freaky NotLikeThis
[3:16:21] Blackhaxx: alpha dead EZ
[3:16:23] Zinaroth: So people would rather sit 3 hours in queue than go make a tank?
[3:16:24] SpikerzX: If only they made a Evoker Tank spec...
[3:16:26] ijuki: Well, alpha is alpha, not many people in it
[3:16:33] JellonaCub: KEKW
[3:16:34] Cakeabsorber: OMEGALUL
[3:16:40] Blas0n: no envoker tank spec sad
[3:16:41] BreninUK: need somemore tank spec talents out. get some more tanks testign stuff. get them pali monks and wars going
[3:16:41] warrenny: Yeah movie 😂
[3:16:44] Sollice: I GUESS THEY SHOULD HAVE MADE AN EVOKER TANK SPEC!
[3:17:20] Ooshraxa: @Sollice YES! I need another tank that has a ranged offspec
[3:17:26] Razmasbear: Monk tanks are kinda fun so might get myself one
[3:17:43] theagiledev: Debating a return to WoW or FFXIV, hard choices lol.

[3:22:30] lokiemkcuf: lol
[3:22:46] theagiledev: @theagiledev @jkitchin75 Dont want to pay two subs haha
[3:22:56] Dkrampage19: is this evoker?
[3:23:12] Razmasbear: yes
[3:23:23] jkitchin75: @theagiledev fair point play what you like the most
[3:23:44] Quojin: i saw you hitt him with the chain
[3:23:50] Razmasbear: For me it will be my druid, 16 years with her and ain't abadining her now
[3:23:59] NispyCriblet: Why do he have soul shape?
[3:24:19] abracka_: getting my ass kicked by agatha in the mage tower for outlaw rogue. kill me
[3:24:37] Sollice: Random Question: Anyone a drone enthusiast here?
[3:25:35] backstreetalright: This is it, anyone in chat knows if lvling is harder? Or same old story?
[3:25:53] Razmasbear: Suppose its same old same old
[3:26:03] looney199725: lvling keeps getting nerfed in wow
[3:26:05] OviTheGray: 50% increase atm
[3:26:28] nightmayor12: Where is the damage meter tho
[3:26:39] mrelgaato: alfa
[3:26:42] PrimalRain: no addons yet
[3:26:43] OviTheGray: not on alpha :)
[3:26:44] mrelgaato: no addos
[3:26:45] Sollice: I add ons in alpha
[3:26:48] MarshallOnline: does the dragon healing spec feel pretty strong?
[3:26:51] Sollice: No
[3:26:53] Ryathael: @nightmayor12 Its alpha, addons havent updated/been enabled yet.
[3:27:07] backstreetalright: Cuz i want me and my friends to make memories while lvling not just bang some mobs out ykwim
[3:27:25] XBazenTus: New dungeon rigth? beereeLOVE
[3:27:33] PrimalRain: can still make memories, just won't take a month like vanilla
[3:27:48] DJ_PWNZ: only visage form gets armor
[3:27:53] MoJoShMaN: I heard you don't see armor in dragon format at all
[3:27:54] Razmasbear: dracthyrs don't get to sghow the armor unless in visage
[3:28:00] mrelgaato: prot warrior needs more magic protection of some sort, physicla damge is fine=)
[3:28:01] ArcaneSyntax: shoulders belts and tabards show on the dragon model.
[3:28:08] No7AG4IN: how many classes does the new race have>
[3:28:11] szble: tier set should show
[3:28:28] Zerfell: Shoulders and Belt are the only two so far
[3:28:29] Razmasbear: dracthyrs are evokers only
[3:28:30] Strouss: Wht is your fav trinkets for Brew Current Retail?
[3:28:30] ArcaneSyntax: they said more for tier sets will show.
[3:28:30] Benjaminoo_: @No7AG4IN 1
[3:28:31] br3z: some shoulders and some belts with a 3D asset
[3:28:32] Assau1tandVinegar: @ArcaneSyntax new race only has Evoker i believe
[3:28:43] backstreetalright: @primalrain ok you got me man i want a hard game man thats what i need!
[3:28:46] PrimalBF: PrimalBF subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 5 months!

[3:29:40] Blastojunior: Might already be news but I just havent heard is there any new race/ class combos?
[3:29:53] NispyCriblet: I wanna be a dragon shaman
[3:29:58] mrelgaato: Tauren rogue)
[3:29:59] PrimalRain: vipervirus9 classic may be more what you're looking for, but even leveling there isn't hard. just more time consuming imo.
[3:30:01] mayonaes: @Blastojunior Yes there is
[3:30:03] ArcaneSyntax: @blastojunior every race can be mage and rogue
[3:30:07] ShowDUH: @Blastojunior Mage/Priest/Rogue can be all races now
[3:30:11] Razmasbear: rogues priests and mages open up to all races so tauren mages will be ral
[3:30:14] Blastojunior: Oh awesome thanks guys!
[3:30:18] Sollice: I guess it makes sense that Drakthyr can only be their races class since they have been asleep and never interacted with other beings
[3:30:34] MarshallOnline: there are no "hard" mmos really, it runs counter intuitive to an mmos goal which is gain as many players as possible. Even vanilla wasn't hard, just time consuming.
[3:30:41] Sollice: But hopefully with them coming in to the world lore wise it makes sense to open it up to other classes
[3:30:46] Blastojunior: Yeahhh getting back into wow from a year hiatus. feels good man
[3:31:02] Razmasbear: that doesn't mean that dracthyr can't learn how to be warrior or rogue or hunter
[3:31:21] Thoreya: if fire mage talents are trash in DF i think im gonna main evoker
[3:31:27] Thoreya: sadge
[3:31:32] Sollice: It doesn’t mean they can’t in the future no but remember your starting the character fresh
[3:31:50] Lostdogal: can we make a kul tiran paladin yet?
[3:32:14] Gezber: blue Evo seems great
[3:32:16] Thoreya: i feel like kul tiran has to be the lowest populated race in the game
[3:32:17] Razmasbear: that mammoth model is dsmn cool... thsy showed it as possible mount? dropping from that boss perhaps?
[3:32:18] Eolus99: it looks like @Towelliee after dark in the dark lol
[3:32:19] Thoreya: i never see them ever
[3:32:23] sliproach: @Lostdogal Nope to big to be light
[3:32:45] warrenny: Goblin pally Kappa
[3:32:47] tronbadgames: kul tiran paladin is like the big drunk pirate of the light
[3:32:56] Blas0n: these morning streams kick ass @Towelliee
[3:32:58] OviTheGray: every race that has priests and warriors should have paladins :)
[3:33:01] Razmasbear: Goblin priest is fun as hell
[3:33:02] Sollice: Yea actually doesn’t make sense you can’t be a lil titan paladin
[3:33:18] Lundrai: Undead pally hype
[3:33:18] Moobot: Plans for WOTLK Beta. Some simple leveling and helping Blizzard test. At first there won't be a lot of people to do content with. That will change when 80 Template comes into play. OH and I don't have Beta keys ask Panda
[3:33:21] sliproach: panda druids
[3:33:22] Sollice: Kul tiran stupid phone
[3:33:22] Benjaminoo_: goblin DH when?
[3:33:24] HeavensPeak: undead paladin when. do extra damage to yourself
[3:33:25] Ryathael: Undead Druid/Paladin are the two that make the least sense to me, but that I want the most.
[3:33:27] warrenny: Pls no never undead pally
[3:33:28] garbagaha: undead druid pls
[3:33:36] Razmasbear: morning, we have  it afternoon herre...
[3:33:41] OviTheGray: think DH will be limited also
[3:33:54] h_u_r_k_: undead druid would be cool
[3:33:59] Eviltuna13: Forsaken and Gnome Paladins cohhD
[3:33:59] backstreetalright: @primalrain  you are correct we need to bind together and find a way to make the game harder without being super long i agree with you
[3:34:02] Lundrai: I think they'll only open up classes that don't entail a lot of work
[3:34:08] h_u_r_k_: wouldnt make sense lore wise
[3:34:12] Sollice: DH won’t switch to more races. Not until Illidan can come back and train more
[3:34:23] Razmasbear: kul tirtan druid forms are mkinda undead looking so what kind of druid forms would undeads get?
[3:34:25] akabcz: pumping guys
[3:34:35] OviTheGray: @Lothlend they could. risen druids from Darkshore :)

[3:34:41] omnifreakfx: @h_u_r_k_ bone/zombified animal forms would be pretty dope.
[3:34:45] Thoreya: gnome shamans
[3:34:55] wEiRdO_dUdE: 20K EZ
[3:34:59] datcreepa: kul tiran druids would look like something out of One Piece
[3:35:06] ArcaneSyntax: not even as good as a warlock now smh my head
[3:35:13] OviTheGray: i need my gnome druid.. little kitty form :)
[3:35:15] omnifreakfx: @Razmasbear Kultiran druid forms are more tree/skinwalker looking
[3:35:42] Eviltuna13: @OviTheGray even better Mechanical animal forms
[3:35:42] Thoreya: "advanced" class
[3:36:16] icerasta: it does advanced damage is what they mean
[3:36:21] Sollice: Gnomes and goblins should be removed from the game. All of the WoW races should come together and wipe them all out
[3:36:30] Sollice: Nasty little fucks
[3:36:40] OviTheGray: @Sollice u are wrong sir
[3:36:40] tardislessdoctor: If i pre order at the level that comes with a month of game time does it automatically trigger? Or can i choose when i want to use the time?
[3:36:47] herzlustafir: Zuup dudes
[3:36:50] Razmasbear: yes
[3:37:06] RealMelorandor: What are some good things about Shadowlands?
[3:37:06] Razmasbear: it triggers the second you preorder
[3:37:11] mrelgaato: @Sollice How about vulperas?)
[3:37:28] Daddyknut: @realMelorandor its ending
[3:37:31] tardislessdoctor: @Razmasbear Appreciate it!
[3:37:35] elizondria: Have you tried the scarlet adaptation red build?
[3:37:46] sliproach: @tardislessdoctor it just adds to any exitsting sub you have or grants it instantly
[3:38:03] Sollice: Vulpera doesnt bother me as much for some reason
[3:38:12] gelimarr: what chair do you have
[3:38:26] herzlustafir: Can vulperan mate with worgen = worgperan?
[3:38:38] elizondria: with the fire breath cleave healing and such i've seen some insane damage from kalamazi's PoV at least
[3:38:42] Quojin: @Sollice its cause theyre cute
[3:38:49] minael1: @Sollice  only children are bothered by a game character.
[3:38:54] mrelgaato: @Gemmeke Herman Miller
[3:38:56] elizondria: That I don't know :(
[3:39:01] Fugazi811: before the extra talents, etc
[3:39:10] Sollice: @Anadormu Yes...I am really bother. It consumes my thoughts at night before I sleep
[3:39:17] Sollice: Come on man
[3:39:18] moppernyc: the problem with scarlet adaptation is that you have to waste a ton of globals healing people, so the damage you get back might not make up for it
[3:39:29] OviTheGray: all the gnome haters have the right to be wrong :)
[3:39:43] elizondria: @moppernyc With the fire breath cleave talent you don't need to, because if it cant hit an enemy it will heal an ally.
[3:39:52] gelimarr: Turtle tank is so cool

[4:07:30] sliproach: was no hype going into SL wowhead had no news on what was going to be in SL
[4:07:32] RealMelorandor: It kind of sucks now cause of Shadowlands record breaking sales, and worst as fuck expansion, now Dragonflight is going to suffer
[4:07:34] strchsr: @Towelliee Stand up so you don't get DVT lol
[4:07:37] mrabs0lute: Have they mentioned any PVP changes coming in Dragon flgiht?

[4:21:09] br3z: nah gotta wait for cd n multi dot
[4:21:26] baldpet: lava totem now spreads it a bit
[4:21:30] elizondria: no way to spread but liquid magma totem (bottom right) exists that AoE applies flame shock on a 1 minute
[4:21:32] br3z: would be sick if you could just spread it
[4:22:14] br3z: pretty much
[4:22:23] strchsr: Earth Shock is your spender
[4:22:40] jhajden: right side reduce your big cds + u got storm elemental there
[4:22:42] strchsr: Windspeaker's Lava Resurgence obviously
[4:22:43] AveragePvp: Oh nice that was our best ST legendary
[4:23:33] tornbraclet: i dont know how ele shaman plays in DF but they could do some serious dmg with chain lightning with the overload proc
[4:23:52] NEMERL: yes
[4:23:52] AveragePvp: thats a legendary
[4:23:55] manmower: this one sounds better
[4:23:55] NEMERL: it is
[4:23:58] Aquadriel: was a lego yes
[4:23:59] baldpet: there is a ascendance, further beyond build where you can keep ascendance up for over a min
[4:24:01] br3z: yeah its a SL lego too
[4:24:06] Keyastaron_: yea it is in legion
[4:24:17] strchsr: Windspeaker's Lava Resurgence and Deeply Rooted Elements are both SL legendaries
[4:24:24] psychoxanderx: There will be legenadry in DF?
[4:24:35] manmower: that's how to spread the flameshock then
[4:24:42] ZangetsuVMG: ZangetsuVMG subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 6 months! 
[4:24:58] gargakan: @psychoxanderx  no legendary
[4:25:14] Sarocus: Meaningful choices!
[4:25:15] br3z: @psychoxanderx could be special things like slyvanas bow from SoD but not like SL/legion legos
[4:26:35] h_u_r_k_: can we keep primal strike
[4:26:37] AveragePvp: Im going to have like 8 ele specsd
[4:26:39] FostBros: ele has a few builds you can do

[4:28:15] strchsr: @Towelliee Further Beyond is a DBZ reference lol
[4:28:19] AveragePvp: The entire bottom of the ele tree is currenty legos or conduits lmfao
[4:28:22] AveragePvp: at least it seems
[4:28:25] manmower: these talent trees are turning into class revamps
[4:28:27] YawGmotHCheN: more like 6s
[4:28:56] wanderingfox: that's the whole point... It's meant to replace the leveling experience too
[4:29:10] Barret: wonder if it'll improve leveling
[4:29:22] StreamElements: Use code POGTOWEL120 for $120 off at https://strms.net/TowellieeFactorMarBot #ad
[4:29:32] Kriven: i was hoping to get new spells that were perm not stuff from previous expansions
[4:29:36] wanderingfox: given you get something every level now it'll at least feel like gaining a level means something again
[4:29:42] h_u_r_k_: you'll still have meta builds, but atleast it gives people more choices.
[4:29:42] LegacyofTork: I think that’s a great thing with so many possibilities, actual choices for folks to play with even if it’s suboptimal. I say this as a war who uses the leaper lego because I’m lazy haha
[4:30:05] strchsr: Primordial Wave
[4:30:28] YawGmotHCheN: aftershock in pretty good in dungeon
[4:30:38] MarshallOnline: hope warlock and hunter get nerfed a bit, they been top tier through pretty much all of shadow lands.

[4:31:14] ShowDUH: @Towelliee yes borked it's intended to give 2 charge
[4:31:16] wanderingfox: yeah shadowstep for rogues is broken for multiple charges too
[4:31:18] Aquadriel: i think is one of the not working stuff
[4:31:18] Sarocus: Currently broken, yes
[4:31:23] ShowDUH: just like Healing stream totem in class tree
[4:31:30] Maldor313: not working rn i think same happens with healing stream totem in resto
[4:32:07] wanderingfox: most of the "gain a charge" stuff seems broken when taken multiple times from what i've seen
[4:32:12] Aquadriel: earthquake, earth shock
[4:32:14] YawGmotHCheN: stormkeeper is nature spell?
[4:32:16] JellonaCub: stormkeeper atleast

[4:35:16] Talk_Nerdy_2Me: 80+ maelstrom= spend
[4:35:22] STRANGEBEARGAMES: Flame Shock Opener, Lightning Bolt Chain Lightning and Lava Burst are your maelstrom builders, Earth Shock and Earth Quake are Mael Spenders. If it glows press it

[4:38:31] chulklol: and ur CL
[4:38:48] YawGmotHCheN: that's where you got your lighting net

[4:40:49] chulklol: it spread flame shock
[4:40:55] chulklol: dunno if it worth it
[4:40:58] Kooznik: Just play Hailstorm frost shock weaving with Chain Lightning and spend maelstrom on Earthquake @Towelliee

[4:41:34] strchsr: pour one out for Echoing Shock, doesn't look like it made it to the talent tree
[4:41:35] jhajden: magma totem sucks
[4:41:39] chulklol: even for st
[4:41:43] backstreetalright: Ok strange question if you never run out of mana what is the mana bar doing there?
[4:41:50] baldpet: frost shock is in the other tree
[4:42:04] YawGmotHCheN: You do run out of mana
[4:42:05] br3z: @vipervirus9 heals use mana
[4:42:12] Diamondead1: @vipervirus9 for dps/tank specs mana is there for heals
[4:42:15] looney199725: magma totem could be gd
[4:42:16] gritbarontv: and no crash lightning
[4:42:20] looney199725: it used to be gd its worth testing
[4:42:50] YawGmotHCheN: seems buged as well
[4:42:53] chulklol: earth shock  buffs earthquake by 120%
[4:42:54] Kooznik: I think it is bugged because you didnt have frost shock before. Just respec into it
[4:42:58] AveragePvp: Ele tree is broken af hahahaha
[4:43:06] gairefear: Broke talent
[4:43:22] looney199725: id go for magma totem

[4:44:40] dubiusdingus: @Towelliee logging out and back in fixed the abilities not working for me
[4:44:48] looney199725: check to see if it has talents that buff magma totem
[4:45:17] chulklol: Mountains Will Fall + Further Beyond  is the way to go in m+ i think

[4:46:59] Thaysula: @tojluty some are folded into the new trees
[4:47:15] looney199725: try primordial into magma totem
[4:48:10] Cakeabsorber: YEP
[4:48:27] strchsr: I think you can still do the funny combo: Flame Shock -> Stormkeeper -> Primordial Wave -> Lava Burst -> Lightning Bolt -> Lava Burst -> Lightning Bolt -> Earth Shock
[4:48:30] gairefear: Watching someone play ele shaman is like someone being like how many spells do you want? YES
[4:48:33] looney199725: @Towelliee what were the talents below magma totem?
[4:48:35] looney199725: if they buff it
[4:48:37] looney199725: may be worth
[4:49:21] looney199725: have you tried prim into magma totme/
[4:49:48] gairefear: Having to manually apply flame shock for the most part kinda sucks

[4:50:10] jhajden: flame shock on more than 1 isnt really that important unless you go with sky breaker that reduce your ele
[4:50:29] gritbarontv: which is fine
[4:50:32] JonVonZombie: wait  talents coming back?
[4:50:36] looney199725: @Towelliee get a priest to PI your totem lmao
[4:51:00] gairefear: @jonvonzombie yes, and no more covenants or stuff… for now…
[4:51:04] gritbarontv: that's nice, no totems needed
[4:51:08] strchsr: The only one is Skyfury but it's a PvP talent
[4:51:24] gairefear: Totem king shaman next
[4:51:28] JonVonZombie: welllllll   when this launches i may make a comeback to the game too
[4:51:41] gairefear: Do a all totems shaman run next
[4:51:44] zgag: Towelliee.  Do you expect more dungeons to be released with the next build
[4:52:07] gairefear: Shaman is seriously like a machine gun, for enhancement and ranged
[4:52:13] Lenietwitch: that feels more like a ST/cleave build more than an aoe one, maybe for dungeons ain't that great
[4:52:19] Ch0p_Su3y: searing totem was nice for enhance
[4:52:27] gritbarontv: usually you use totems when being support/healer
[4:52:43] gairefear: Stun totem is insane :D
[4:52:46] looney199725: ele feels like shit without the stats tbh
[4:53:03] Ch0p_Su3y: speed totem
[4:53:13] jhajden: your elemental double the duration of flame shock aswell
[4:53:30] JonVonZombie: i'm just wishing the dragon race would allow more classes
[4:53:33] manmower: gonna charge people money for my elite talent builds
[4:53:49] gairefear: 1 enhance shaman, 2 ele shamans, 1 resto shaman, with the CDR talent for stun totem = infinite stun shaman
[4:54:01] manmower: Thrall Shaman, Dumpster Fire build, Totem Popper
[4:54:05] procyon_mfc: Kreygasm

[4:54:28] NeSBigBasher1337: You think it's gonna go that deep? People hardly ask for covenants or specs as it is IMO
[4:54:30] JonVonZombie: Paladin HAMMER BUILD
[4:54:32] iloveyalunn: Scorched Spicy Chicken Build
[4:54:32] xch4se: twoellie you qued for random dungeon or heroic DF dungeon?

[4:54:54] gairefear: Cockfucker build … cus its time to big dick it
[4:54:57] balart: @Towelliee ngl it sounds like an exaggeration, cookie cutter builds will come and every1 will copy them lol
[4:55:05] omnifreakfx: thats how its like when ever I get back into Magic the gathering. So many deck names I'm like...wut? lol
[4:55:05] Aidler: can’t you just respec before entering the dungeon?
[4:55:11] Imolius: The Bobby Judgement build is a better name..
[4:55:12] Galadeon: is there an official evoker discord yet?

[4:55:34] NickLeonhearth: pls no, I aint gonna bother learning this stupid builds, its silly AF
[4:55:34] zgag: Watch most of those builds be the boring builds
[4:55:37] zgag: p
[4:55:37] Shamnator: not everyohne can lick my face
[4:55:39] Nokterian: Bro hold my beer Build
[4:55:39] gairefear: Wouldnt the build just be named after the skill priority?
[4:55:42] relaption: @RocketMan23 nah dude theres definitely going to be people doing this for like +10's lol
[4:55:45] gairefear: Gamers are lazy
[4:55:46] h_u_r_k_: aint no ele gonna lick my face CouldYouNot
[4:55:54] bobbyg24k: The Pneumonoultramicroscopicsilicovolcanoconiosis build
[4:55:57] Imolius: Reeeeeeeee Build.. :)
[4:56:03] Syprus1: well there kinda already are in forms of conduits and leggos
[4:56:03] zirethAK: towCopium towCopium towCopium
[4:56:07] gritbarontv: there is going to be top cookie cutter, that everyone will use most likely
[4:56:11] iloveyalunn: TFW people realize cookie cutter builds will always exist no matter whaat
[4:56:11] steward93: I think its good, adds variety to your class
[4:56:23] Nokterian: towCopium
[4:56:27] Lightninghandz: Thats currently how Ele Shaman is, theres 1 relevant M+ build and the other 2 pretty much blow in comparison
[4:56:28] backstreetalright: We are with you T
[4:56:30] Rudric_Ice: towCopium towCopium towCopium towCopium towCopium
[4:56:30] zirethAK: towCopium
[4:56:32] balart: @Towelliee prolly there's gonna be 2 builds: one for m+ and one for raiding
[4:56:35] Drizzz1e: Preach
[4:56:36] gairefear: The “core” of the class would probably be cookie cutter, with divergence in 5 or 6 talents i think
[4:56:42] RocketMan23: @RocketMan23 not a chance, people in 10s are generally clueless
[4:56:49] mozavich: cookie cutter just means a preset that everyone uses, regardless of the # of presets. ie, a cookie cutter
[4:56:51] Syprus1: i dont care im just gonna play what the mathmaticians tell me to play
[4:57:01] atowellthatiallreadyused: iff
[4:57:02] Unitsven: towD
[4:57:03] atowellthatiallreadyused: idd
[4:57:07] zgag: They going to need more than 10
[4:57:08] Nokterian: Same for Warlocks back in TBC just one cookie cutter build
[4:57:12] looney199725: i need 20 loadouts
[4:57:14] looney199725: 10 isnt enough
[4:57:14] atowellthatiallreadyused: its alot
[4:57:15] manmower: you don't just give away the rings of power
[4:57:17] TheUnknowing: I think it will still fall back to being cookie cutter for the most part but there is definitely room to play around
[4:57:23] looney199725: i need 8 for the raid like 10 for m+ 4 for pvp
[4:57:40] spicymangobaby: Yo Towelliee, ur a sick cunt
[4:57:45] zirethAK: after all this time you guys still fall for it
[4:57:51] bumpstock75: midmax will have load out for each boss
[4:57:56] atowellthatiallreadyused: y balance it out
[4:58:12] Seerated: Ooof ! There's 10 loadouts ?! Must've missed that part, but really practical for multicontent-players
[4:58:15] zgag: Max got the spreadsheet already going
[4:58:18] looney199725: you need like 20 load outs
[4:58:20] looney199725: lets be real
[4:58:20] spainard15: LOL class leaders again
[4:58:22] Collected1: they'll make an add on for all that i'm sure
[4:58:30] Sollice: @CombatWombat195 Like awesome sick? or like he is sick like cough cough
[4:58:32] nusher1: nusher1 subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 68 months! 
[4:58:35] zgag: I got the link if you like to take a look ( Max's spreadsheet)
[4:58:40] Rudric_Ice: sub to me and you get my build
[4:58:40] looney199725: 8 for raid youll need one for fort week/tyran/ then there necrotic weeks and all that
[4:58:51] gairefear: 10 talents would be fine for someone that does 1 kinda content, maybe 2, but not enough for someone that does 3
[4:58:57] manmower: people will settle on a preferred build and use that most of the time, sort of like covenants, soulbinds, and conduits
[4:59:14] liloso16: you can make a macro that changes your talents so a addon would be possible

[4:59:39] TacDuc: That one got way too personal...
[4:59:44] wEiRdO_dUdE: Emotional support bears LUL
[4:59:49] kapparN: good thing about being an aotc / ksm / vicious mount player is that we'll have more freedom to toy around ... no specific op build for a specific encounter. I love it
[4:59:52] Collected1: i think they're already doing it based on his answer
[4:59:54] TacDuc: DO IT!!!
[4:59:54] Inthezonewow: We gonna lose a tier if we get a tank Kappa
[4:59:56] looney199725: it wont happen
[4:59:56] Galadeon: Evoker Blackdragon magic based tank please
[4:59:59] looney199725: we dont need more tanks
[5:00:05] fleet21_: Couple hundred grand probs
[5:00:06] mavericks312: bro yall got 6 tanks
[5:00:09] lynixxis: We do need more tanks.
[5:00:13] manmower: make evoker tank, but it has to be body type 1 only
[5:00:14] atowellthatiallreadyused: i quees
[5:00:15] lynixxis: There should 1000% be a mail tank.
[5:00:15] Inthezonewow: I agree with Collected1
[5:00:16] looney199725: mail classes sure
[5:00:16] Siddydiddydo: make a shaman tank
[5:00:19] looney199725: we need more mail
[5:00:20] Alienfromger: small indie companie cant afford it Kappa
[5:00:22] looney199725: but not as tank
[5:00:24] remixonfire91: make survival hunter a tank
[5:00:33] SirVoro: Hunter tank INC Kappa
[5:00:35] Collected1: when Ion doesn't give a hard no, you know it's already in progress
[5:00:35] ShrenTheOrc: so how does evoker work with legion...im guessing nothing they just dont experience it.
[5:00:35] gairefear: Make deathwing, into an evoker, and make him tank
[5:00:38] scramperlive: Earth magic based tank is all i want
[5:00:40] looney199725: looks its gonna go like this
[5:00:40] relaption: @Sideric like a rock elemental based tank
[5:00:42] Azg0th: Shaman tank go
[5:00:46] zgag: Everyone for the next build invites will play Evoker.  = Low tank pop on Alpha p
[5:00:48] wanderingfox: would be neat to see a 'mid-range' tank like hunters but the pet can actually tank the raid
[5:00:48] looney199725: we had dk monk and dh
[5:00:51] scramperlive: could be shaman, could be dracthyr, could be mag.
[5:00:54] looney199725: all those are melee/tank/heal
[5:00:54] manmower: wouldn't DH be offended? haven't they been waiting longer for a third?
[5:00:59] looney199725: the next 3 will all be range/something
[5:01:00] Siddydiddydo: @Sideric exactly, earth abilities for tanking
[5:01:02] Aidler: just give everybody the ability to tank. tank problem solved
[5:01:05] jhajden: fire ele is your big CD

[5:01:28] yoelleoy11: stormkeeper is ur real big CD Kappa
[5:01:30] looney199725: raid spots as melee are low
[5:01:39] gairefear: Isnt there only 2 tank class in alpha? DK or bear? Probably cus most the new talents are on heal or dps
[5:01:39] looney199725: so making range is easier
[5:01:53] TacDuc: @manmower DH doesn't really fit a third spec, but evoker would make sense, as black dragons are super tanky
[5:02:03] zgag: Maybe Blizz should limit the amount of time someone can play Evoker per day on the alpha
[5:02:08] looney199725: if they make more range its not a big issue
[5:02:16] pkmnmunchlax: is it worth playing shadowlands atm ? i played it first 8 months then quit
[5:02:17] zgag: That way more tanks can hit the alpha/beta
[5:02:23] looney199725: because range is more seen in raiding
[5:02:28] atowellthatiallreadyused: now healers will be god
[5:02:38] manmower: @TacDuc but evoker is a caster, doesn't make sense as a tank
[5:02:48] gairefear: An evoker with “scales” like deathwing to take temporary damage, and earth magic for armor etc.
[5:02:49] Keyastaron_: @Towelliee  yeah the last hero classes were tanks / dps now theres a healer now
[5:02:51] atowellthatiallreadyused: ppl allwaýs complain
[5:02:56] looney199725: no one wants to play tank bro
[5:03:00] mavericks312: now yall know how dps feels on a daily basis lol
[5:03:00] looney199725: tanks are rare in wow
[5:03:02] looney199725: good ones rares
[5:03:11] TheUnknowing: invite me blizz, am tank thank you.
[5:03:14] gairefear: Im a shit tank, pog
[5:03:32] Aidler: has Blizz ever made a ranged tanking class? would that even be possible?
[5:03:32] Collected1: more invites too i'm guessing
[5:03:54] Collected1: Aidler : very difficult as the boss always moves to the agro
[5:03:56] looney199725: lmao wouldnt have this problem f tinker was the class copium much haha
[5:03:58] atowellthatiallreadyused: how to get invite to alpha is it anything required
[5:04:01] gritbarontv: I'm a methodical tank, hate being rush, lol
[5:04:02] looney199725: tinker would be range healer and tank 100%
[5:04:05] wanderingfox: you basically just retheme and beef up hunter. pet does all the tanking
[5:04:11] jhajden: cabalist
[5:04:14] Collected1: Aidler : i suppose if the ranged had an agro holding pet it might work
[5:04:19] looney199725: shame blizz doesnt want to give us cannons to place
[5:04:20] gairefear: There are ranged tanks, its called a hunter that can run
[5:04:27] FatLOL: whats your pvp level
[5:04:36] zgag: Maybe when more dungeons get released more tanks will come out
[5:04:39] retro_justice: wait is september 26th official offical now? :O
[5:04:45] FatLOL: oh its alpha my bad
[5:04:47] mavericks312: ppl pvp still lol
[5:04:49] TacDuc: It's called Yes
[5:04:49] Moobot: Plans for WOTLK Beta. Some simple leveling and helping Blizzard test. At first there won't be a lot of people to do content with. That will change when 80 Template comes into play. OH and I don't have Beta keys ask Panda

[5:05:00] lynixxis: 50%
[5:05:00] looney199725: i dunno
[5:05:02] zgag: Max mentioned that he thinks dungeons queues will pop more once they have all 70 talents points

[5:05:10] truman0725: big KEKW luckily I dont really play pvp
[5:05:12] looney199725: they cant balance pvp
[5:05:12] Keyastaron_: Evoker best PVP class Kappa
[5:05:13] OviTheGray: its pvp.. who cares? :)
[5:05:13] tronbadgames: its def gonna be a lot of work trying to balance this expansion
[5:05:14] sshadeh: the hybrid shit might be wild in pvp
[5:05:14] picarazi: the good thing wrath will be up
[5:05:18] sshadeh: healer + dps trees
[5:05:21] gairefear: @diamondead1 shaking my head my head
[5:05:26] looney199725: pvp has always had issues
[5:05:26] picarazi: wrath pvp is amazing
[5:05:27] Aidler: @collected1 could be interesting. some hunters in past expansions were able to tank low level content with their pets
[5:05:31] stabzmcgeee: they need more classes on the alpha
[5:05:31] fleet21_: OMEGALUL RIB OMEGALUL S
[5:05:31] Siddydiddydo: Does blood work yet? I heard a lot of talents were broken before
[5:05:33] zellyree: shadowlands is the worst 4sure, goes in arena --> ded in 2sec
[5:05:43] Diamondead1: @gairefear rip in pieces
[5:05:46] Aquadriel: Also theres only 2 tank spec with talents @Towelliee
[5:05:48] retro_justice: yeah idk why people like SL pvp
[5:05:54] sliproach: @Towelliee Probally why blizz want to do more small patches to fix specs like they used to weekly
[5:05:54] stabzmcgeee: i wonder how many people arent playing because they are waiting for thier class trees
[5:05:56] AveragePvp: I could be a minority but I still think pvp has the potential to be really good with all these options, and im a multi glad so im not just some scrub LUL
[5:05:58] TacDuc: I just want an ultimate healing Blood DK, a rogue with nothing but stuns
[5:05:58] RocketMan23: ive heard lepan say he doesnt want to play blood dk because of not having all his talents sooo
[5:06:00] gairefear: @sideric ele shaman talents are basically broken right now too
[5:06:01] 00birdhouse: you're a tank and you're currently playing with Shaman
[5:06:03] mavericks312: maybe they should have held off the dragon bois till later in alpha
[5:06:03] looney199725: @Towelliee tell ion we want our damn tinker class
[5:06:04] TheGiant99: weell people wanna play the new thing in the alpha
[5:06:14] Throdio: I think more tanks with talent trees would help
[5:06:14] Siddydiddydo: bring out the prot pallies
[5:06:16] SethRonin: Morning Towelliee
[5:06:17] Buckwink: SL arena is the die in stunlock expansion
[5:06:21] gritbarontv: they need more people too
[5:06:22] ScalarGaming: blizzard should make a tank npc like ff14 technology @towelliee
[5:06:28] cappei: Stinkers yuck
[5:06:29] backstreetalright: Bakc in the day you would wait a hole afternoon for DM
[5:06:29] gairefear: Paladin
[5:06:34] looney199725: haha a man can dream
[5:06:35] wEiRdO_dUdE: Tinker can be a tank
[5:06:36] stallowned: LUL
[5:06:36] ar_melol: but thats where your tank will be. :)
[5:06:39] manmower: I want my Demon Hunter ranged spec, I was misled by the class name
[5:06:42] zellyree: its gonna happen 4sure
[5:06:45] Alienfromger: never say never LUL
[5:06:45] DanielTheMedic: i want a class with turrets
[5:06:50] Drizzz1e: or longer
[5:06:56] ar_melol: @manmower YES
[5:07:01] gairefear: Next talenta needs to be paladin or warlock
[5:07:04] yaldzz: @Towelliee u played ret pala in alpha?
[5:07:07] Maldor313: currently the only tank has new talents is dk right? that is another problem
[5:07:08] xch4se: @Towelliee what is the easiest way to get back to Azure Span from Org in Alpha?
[5:07:16] wanderingfox: or BRD where no one did it ever. No one had that kind of time lol
[5:07:21] TacDuc: What would the Tinker class even do? People keep saying they want it, but what would it even do? Just engineering, but it's a class
[5:07:22] mavericks312: nobody wanted to do DM lol
[5:07:22] looney199725: @Towelliee if you asked wow players we would be getting a new race with 1 spec ppl would say your full of shit too
[5:07:30] yoelleoy11: did no tanks gets their new trees yet?
[5:07:44] gairefear: @tacduc tinker would drive a giant fucking mech
[5:08:03] mavericks312: its smart testing imo
[5:08:12] xch4se: Ahh gotcha
[5:08:15] xch4se: thanks!
[5:08:31] looney199725: @TacDuc tinker would be healer/range/tank they would place down turrets and use mechanical abilities to heal and tank it would be a melee/range hybrid tank
[5:08:32] Aidler: everyone in one zone….. aka focused testing
[5:08:34] jetributions: waking shore next i believe right
[5:08:36] looney199725: tinker could work
[5:08:38] Polebegood: it's working well for classes, good feedback and good changes
[5:08:44] looney199725: blizz just dont wanna put the effort into making it
[5:09:01] gairefear: A tinker would call in drone strikes nd nuke the boss
[5:09:12] gairefear: Sargaeras wouldnt stand a chance
[5:09:15] xch4se: I can come tank but know nothing of bear or the dungeons lol
[5:09:24] looney199725: it would be tank spec
[5:09:26] stabzmcgeee: @looney199725 they just made a new race and class,, wtf you mean they dont want to put effort in
[5:09:32] looney199725: it would be range/healer/tank
[5:09:35] Wolfenhoof: as much as i would like a tinker or bard, new classes are needed for wow as urgent as a kodo needs a tit on his neck
[5:09:37] manmower: I'm most excited about seeing the world content, but that'll probably be one of the last things we test
[5:09:45] looney199725: @stabzmcgeee tinker is a whole other ball game to evoker
[5:09:46] Nougat_V: i hope the talent tree changes are pre-patch stuff, cant wait to try out all the changes
[5:09:48] yoelleoy11: with island expeditions they made a team of tinkers with the goblins, a dps a tank and a healer
[5:09:51] sshadeh: a tinker has to be jack of all trades
[5:09:52] Imolius: o.O
[5:09:56] gairefear: Giant fucking mech with nuke arm launcher
[5:10:00] gairefear: Perfect class
[5:10:15] RiptoreCA: Renown? What renown does that do?
[5:10:15] looney199725: tinker would also be mail armor
[5:10:24] Sniqi: @Nougat_V yes, class changes are always pre-patch
[5:10:26] Aidler: whatever wold content that will be….
[5:10:32] Ezekyler: a wrench as a weapon
[5:10:35] manmower: hard to be a robot without plate
[5:10:42] stabzmcgeee: if blizz did tinker it would be a fucking shitshow because the wow community has all these ideas of what tinker hsould be that they will never be happy
[5:10:51] DanielTheMedic: there was one in GW2 too
[5:10:55] Siddydiddydo: wildstar had so much potential and belly flopped the launch
[5:10:56] DanielTheMedic: forget the name
[5:11:00] jetributions: that pali name fatpala
[5:11:00] Sarocus: I rather get something like the Engineer in Warhammer
[5:11:02] looney199725: @Towelliee blizz know how to make a tinker they have one in overwatch
[5:11:06] xDreddx: engineer yes
[5:11:09] manmower: Mechanist
[5:11:14] gairefear: A tinker should have bastion for a turret, a giant mech body suit, healing turrets and should take up 5 spots in the dungeon
[5:11:19] gairefear: A solo class
[5:11:20] elizondria: gw2 doesn't have traditional tank/heal/dps roles though.
[5:11:27] gritbarontv: in GW2 they all have some time of tank build
[5:11:29] Imolius: Have little Turrets to hold agro for a few moments, while taunt swapping etc with a wrench smack.
[5:11:36] WSeveryn: @towelliee I loved my engineer tank in wildstar
[5:11:59] Siddydiddydo: that's because the launch day login queue was 24 hours lol
[5:12:06] looney199725: bruh let them throw explosive rabbits as bombs
[5:12:08] manmower: Sepulchre was kind of a Wildstar raid
[5:12:14] looney199725: like it would be the most fun class on earth
[5:12:40] exilethegamer: Man I enjoyed the fuck out of wildstar at launch and got insanely burnt out out of nowhere
[5:12:41] looney199725: what else we gonna get class wise?
[5:12:43] looney199725: a barb
[5:12:48] looney199725: bard?
[5:12:56] looney199725: i dont wanna sit there singing ppl to death
[5:12:57] Zeppyy: Necro
[5:13:03] Aidler: they need to think of AI party members after a certain waiting time in the future. waiting 30 min. is just crazy
[5:13:05] Imolius: WoW won't use a bard..
[5:13:11] RiptoreCA: What is renown for in DF?
[5:13:12] Aquadriel: cope
[5:13:15] looney199725: tinkers already in wow
[5:13:21] gairefear: Convoke the elements, become part druid
[5:13:23] hopeisalive: singing people to death. no you sing them ot bring them back to life.
[5:13:23] looney199725: so weird to not make them playable
[5:13:27] hopeisalive: so much better
[5:13:29] lynixxis: @Towelliee We're sort of almost done with the Pri9vate servers. Some combat scripting is taking us a while.. but Soon(BlizzardTM soon)
[5:13:46] jetributions: ran with a shaman yesterday that took the typical name oprahwindfury
[5:13:49] wreckshoptv: go full palpatine mode
[5:13:49] looney199725: we had mechangon that touched deeper into tinkers too
[5:14:04] itscityboy: darth sidious monkaS
[5:14:12] gairefear: The mass triple lightning chain is the coolest thing ever when it happens
[5:14:54] danielthegathering: any new stuff on alpha today =) ?
[5:14:57] lynixxis: @Towelliee NcSoft already said they don't care as long as it isn't monetized.
[5:14:57] hopeisalive: ncsoft is literally worse
[5:15:03] exilethegamer: I had figured blizz was going to add a tinker class after BFA because of the tinker class NPC outside of the mechagon portal at dazaralor harbor
[5:15:19] hopeisalive: they will shut you down or get a cut

[5:15:21] Cakeabsorber: @exiledcross God I wish
[5:15:24] gairefear: NCsoft would rather burn the world. It’s about sending a message
[5:15:29] manmower: yea it would
[5:15:34] hopeisalive: everything has to be free. no pay anywhere
[5:15:37] zenkodac: same for blizz, except every private wow server has a dono system
[5:15:40] Brodih_: yeah its not the same, donations is not a fix charge
[5:15:41] exilethegamer: Not mechagon portal. Whatever that dungeon was to the goblin starting zone
[5:15:41] Sarocus: Warhammer server is the same. They're cool as long as no money is involved
[5:15:47] belaham: probably couldn't play it on stream
[5:16:01] lynixxis: @Towelliee They only stipulated that they cannot charge for server access or new content, etc. So they can accept server donations, streamers can stream, etc. But the server owners cannot restrict access to people via a paywall.
[5:16:02] llNoTToXiCll: You could have it to hwere the devs of the private server receives donations to themselves and not towards the actual game
[5:16:10] RiptoreCA: I don't think Wildstar would be allowed to be devloped this long if there were going to wait 5 years and yeet it
[5:16:16] gairefear: What if you have to donate to play
[5:16:28] looney199725: im not losing hope that someday we get tinker spec
[5:16:29] Zerfell: They need to pass laws to make it so that shut down games become public domain
[5:16:30] lynixxis: @Towelliee The talks are ongoing. Their legal team is rather nice.
[5:16:42] ShrenTheOrc: warhammer is so cool they have twitch drops sometimes
[5:16:44] Dcarter: Hell yes
[5:16:53] 0doz: what a good game.. wildstar.. =(
[5:16:59] zenkodac: i was actually mega surprised when games workshop and ea allowed the warhammer online server the keep going they are infamously stingy with their ips
[5:17:08] Sleepylol93: That game could ve been so nice
[5:17:12] Cakeabsorber: I cant wait to have my personal info leaked again KEKW
[5:17:17] Aidler: a nice legal team….. lol
[5:17:18] Cakeabsorber: 10/10 will play again
[5:17:19] Dcarter: Oh that’s for sure
[5:17:22] Dcarter: I loved that game
[5:17:33] looney199725: its a shame so many mmos fail
[5:17:33] flipx1: wish someone would just buy WS, rework it and release it again.. no luck
[5:17:44] Chiraakitteh: Not sure they would get the raids back for quite a while
[5:17:49] gairefear: It’s really dumb how you can hold a copyright for something you’re not even using in the game space. Like they can just remove a game and be like “noone can play it now cus we didnt make enough with it”
[5:17:50] llNoTToXiCll: i actually think its awesome that people are willing to bring back games on their own props to you people who do that
[5:17:51] N0rz: what killed Wildstar now again?
[5:17:52] belaham: They need to release another tank talent tree
[5:17:53] sifer007: KEKW

[6:02:34] Hulahoopsy: or was it PF
[6:02:36] freetherocktv: @towelliee They need to do ARTHAS turning into lich king for a movie it would do so well and with the correct writers and director it will be a masterpiece
[6:02:39] Hulahoopsy: oh right
[6:02:41] llNoTToXiCll: they have such talented CGI artists
[6:02:45] Hulahoopsy: PF pretty sure
[6:02:45] llNoTToXiCll: its insane
[6:02:49] Belgromm: Yeah they should have just made it all animated instead oh having the human actors they were all pretty bad
[6:03:03] hopeisalive: blizzard make there movies like their commericals. they be epic

[6:03:47] KGB_Habs: Whats the number of bosses per dungeon?
[6:03:59] llNoTToXiCll: @WATWOOD  oh thanks for the small correction i meant CG
[6:04:01] Woddell: @freetherocktv Henry Cavill would make a nice Arthas imo.
[6:04:05] cabalish: lvl60 - 62 / 63 starting zone dungeon/s

[6:04:32] smooshywolf: Haha - right when you started singing the first part of that song - stream cut to a Kung Fu Panda ad at the perfect time so it sounded like "In the arms of the dragon master!"
[6:04:35] strike879: can you still do the dungeons on normal mytic for the gear and upgrade it?
[6:04:39] gairefear: I would love a WoW movie based on a themed event like the siege of ahn’qiraj or something
[6:04:57] mavericks312: thats the first zone in DF correct?
[6:05:06] HaxzorJimDuggan: obsidion throne must be neltharus

[6:06:36] Spathotan: Man said meta achievement
[6:06:41] sshadeh: @Daggerstry this time its a little different, due to special flying mechanics
[6:06:44] zuna1904: new patch for shadowlands looks weird.
[6:06:44] omnifreakfx: @Spathotan LUL
[6:06:44] Fugazi811: He must of missed the dragon flying talks the last 6 months
[6:06:45] Holysal: @Daggerstry you dont have to fly. use your ground mounts EZ
[6:06:47] Biorrwolf: MOP had the best music
[6:06:52] Broomba: @Daggerstry they said flying in DF is no pathfrinder

[6:07:55] karter2811: would be hard to explain how a island full of dragons was going to restrict flight
[6:07:55] looney199725: he wants to use his ground mount to make people wait 2 hours for him to enter raid
[6:07:55] truman0725: I think the leveling experience is going to be awesome with the flying
[6:08:04] TheCliffyShow: I will walk like a real WoW player. The way it was in Classic.

[6:08:21] Tury4l: there will definitively be someone taht goes around and does the whole expansion without using flying just to prove a point
[6:08:23] Biorrwolf: @alienfromger I know. It's ICC all over again. How could they

[6:09:38] Kittastrophe: all the mistakes I've done with moonfire and starfall .. oof
[6:09:39] zuna1904: so whats new in this xpac ? theres no class reworks. m+ is the same. afixxes are still the same crasp. raids are the same. This feels more like Overwatch 2 for WoW.. Oh Talent Trees ? putting passive spells you have right now into a new Book so you can spend Point on it is realy exciting !
[6:09:43] Siqiune: Shaman casting speed is like turtle movement xD
[6:09:54] danielthegathering: @Towelliee can you make a suggestion to blizzard to lower name change cost :D

[6:16:16] atrexy_: the rogue ?
[6:16:17] zuna1904: the login screen to ff14 :D
[6:16:34] wEiRdO_dUdE: Story skipping is the biggest crime in FFXIV
[6:16:41] rohdey: tol dagor all over again towCopium
[6:16:45] looney199725: lmao
[6:16:48] procyon_mfc: is he still in jail?
[6:17:02] looney199725: i swear people just soft
[6:17:05] zuna1904: @wEiRdO_dUdE cuz the game is 90% story 5% raid and 5% transmog farming
[6:17:09] looney199725: wow is not a game for snowflakes sadly
[6:18:00] spankymcpie: hes just using his animal instincts to get more lost
[6:18:09] Wolfenhoof: @inkling_kitty FF crafting is simply on an other level sadly... but they don't got tauren :/

[6:19:06] looney199725: well because mr 500io andy also thinks hes world first raider in wow
[6:19:11] zuna1904: humans are toxic
[6:19:13] ZephyrDraken: yeah savage raiding can be rough with how people get
[6:19:26] SwitchBlue1337: I think people need to understand the difference of constructive criticism and being toxic.
[6:19:33] tulsaboom: @atrexy_  Yay thats so nice towKawaii
[6:19:36] EclipserEU: GW2 gets toxic in the high end content too!
[6:19:40] Dbornfighter: Any game is as toxic as you make it.,
[6:19:45] luckfore: as long as you dont say anything negative about the game they're fine
[6:19:56] Miastrix: Toxicity in ff is still nothing compared to in wow
[6:20:26] Greybeard_ttv: I got kicked from a leveling dungeon the other day for trying to complete a quest, people just suck sometimes lol
[6:20:40] looney199725: HAHA thats the life you have in wow
[6:20:41] Moobot: Plans for WOTLK Beta. Some simple leveling and helping Blizzard test. At first there won't be a lot of people to do content with. That will change when 80 Template comes into play. OH and I don't have Beta keys ask Panda
[6:20:48] looney199725: some people are just mad
[6:20:56] SpectraBG: I mean at the end of the day ff is a lot less competitive and requires a lot less from players to stay up to par, that helps for less toxicity
[6:20:57] jumbledjester: i want that as a mount
[6:21:05] xXSiebzehnXx: I was running an M+ this morning and the tank was doing terrible, but we stuck with it and he bounced on the second wipe on Tredova, I was surprised when I told the Outlaw Rogue he needed to look up rotations because at 257 ilvl he shouldn’t be doing 2.1k overall he actually said I was right. It’s hard to say you need to use community resources without people being butthurt, I was pleasantly surprised he asked me for resources and didn’t flame
[6:21:44] looney199725: if hes doing 2.1k dps at that ilvl hes just afkin
[6:21:52] mufo85: I was in an m+, hunter topping dps ask how everyone was after first boss died, he got kicked
[6:22:32] Greybeard_ttv: I main a healer so I get blamed for everyone's mistakes so I'm used to it lol

[6:23:05] lithium364: you think it would help to mark new players im dungeons?
[6:23:13] Peqdevil: not everyone plays the best build
[6:23:18] Myndjestyr: lol i had a 271 shaman in my +15 group doing 2k damage on bosses (elemental btw)
[6:23:28] xXSiebzehnXx: It’s refreshing when players want to get better though.
[6:23:31] freetherocktv: @mufo85 they kicked him for just asking how everyone was doing?
[6:23:36] Lenietwitch: @looney199725 not really you'll be surprise, sometimes people just pick talents they thing are good or doing bad rotation, forgetting spells, and that result in doing 2.1k dps :P

[6:23:43] Greybeard_ttv: I try not to pug
[6:23:43] Aristy1: people just need to understand bad players are allowed to play the game too its fine
[6:23:47] ElDrakenMan: Anyone else get ex CIA interview vibes from dark cam @towelliee ?
[6:23:51] lithium364: i feel like people would make weak auras to auto remove " new Player symbol players" just like theres an weak aura to remove People from Ragnaros right now
[6:24:06] SpectraBG: @xXSiebzehnXx it's a downward spiral, people get toxic when someone is performing not up to their standards, they go about it a bit too "enthusiasticly" in return these people fire back and get irritated and will respong to criticism more negatively and when someone offers constructive criticism they'll lash back because of previous experience and that just goes on and on
[6:24:08] looney199725: 2.6k io this tier is like 1k io tho
[6:24:15] xXSiebzehnXx: @lithium364 but the remove from Ragnaros makes sense LUL
[6:24:19] xXSiebzehnXx: JP JP
[6:24:19] Lenietwitch: @Aristy1 yes, but dont expect to do a +15 if youy do 2k dps, bad players are allowed to play the game, that's why there is heroic and normal dungeons :P

[6:25:13] Dbornfighter: No its because there is no IO
[6:25:18] looney199725: asmon could make a stream about how to lick paint and hed get 60k + views
[6:25:33] freetherocktv: @mufo85 thats pretty fucked up wow
[6:25:48] llNoTToXiCll: Oh ive had some shit people in XiV dungeons
[6:25:50] SpectraBG: @Towelliee from what I understand, they're not mandatory, you can do them, but you can get top gear just as well without them
[6:26:11] xXSiebzehnXx: I get kicked from groups every once and a while because they realize they all speak Spanish and I don’t LOL
[6:26:27] brian_777777777: resonant arrow just works as an expansion button because I can throw it down and crit everything

[6:27:45] moonlleek: class meta is the biggest problem
[6:27:48] xXSiebzehnXx: I got flamed on my second dungeon in FF and they went off on an anti WoW flame
[6:27:50] Wolfenhoof: clusterfuck is the word you're searching for^^
[6:28:00] infinityarty: its more stressed and peformance demanded gameplay while FF is more a relaxing experience
[6:28:07] Lenietwitch: @xXSiebzehnXx to be fair, there is like 50 % of groups that won't allowed ragnaros/quelthalas/azrlaron players , your complain rarely happens
[6:28:10] looney199725: wow is more competitive than FF some ppl just freak out when they feel pressure
[6:28:25] Dkgungo: healer alt f4d lol
[6:28:30] xXSiebzehnXx: @leniewashere yeah, I’m not mad tbh
[6:28:30] alluza: @Towelliee  says the healer is offline
[6:28:30] SpectraBG: @Towelliee in FF there is hard content, but it's for those that want it, you can get top gear by just doing 1 normal end game dungeon a day, it's easy and relaxing
[6:28:33] xXSiebzehnXx: It happens
[6:28:42] RBPalmer_: !uptime
[6:28:44] danielthegathering: are there earthquake talents?
[6:28:51] looney199725: he alt F4 cuz your preach comment

[6:29:31] Niiichan: Enhancement or elemental ?
[6:29:39] Alt_slash: facts
[6:29:47] steldam: @Khailaan Its the other priest
[6:30:06] Blas0n: @Towelliee its about gear and ego ;)
[6:30:16] rei__03: i mean gear is patch only...
[6:30:18] Rulem: true but that could change
[6:30:24] Rulem: if the devs wanted it to
[6:30:25] rei__03: transmog is the real end game
[6:30:32] Lenietwitch: and dungeons / raids tbf
[6:30:32] xXSiebzehnXx: Where’s my update HoJ Kappa
[6:30:38] StuMc: I would love a tier where they try it.
[6:30:40] looney199725: wow is slappin your dick on the keyboard and being top dps
[6:30:43] zuna1904: no need for another boring FF14 Gearing Game
[6:30:44] SpectraBG: @Towelliee ff raiding will die when we get our own private islands ingame LUL
[6:30:52] supernohva_xt: season 4 perfect time to do it lmao
[6:30:53] mavericks312: liquid echo bdgg wouldnt even bother
[6:30:56] Upcomin: too many ppl would quit
[6:30:58] Upcomin: horrible idea
[6:31:02] xXSiebzehnXx: I’d love to have an Upgraded HoJ on and Enh Shammy towOof
[6:31:05] gregl__: @mavericks312 ofc they would
[6:31:06] Moobot: Calm it with those symbols, @TazzTheGrimreapper (warning)
[6:31:07] Fugazi811: They be gone after reading that
[6:31:07] Alt_slash: cringe
[6:31:09] Strugl3snugle24_: That isn't fun at all, let me progress
[6:31:11] gregl__: but nobody else would
[6:31:14] magultra: Never work
[6:31:18] Korupcija_: it would be fine if I don't have to farm the mount
[6:31:21] Madidius: @mavericks312 the race is not about gear lol
[6:31:23] Lenietwitch: @Towelliee that's exactly why i stop playing gw2, great game, but no gear rewards at all, to me i found no appeal at all
[6:31:25] TacDuc: Shush
[6:31:25] ground4isu: So, 1% of the playerbase leaves....
[6:31:27] Eviltuna13: sounds like a deal to me crreamClown
[6:31:28] chopsaki: drop in subs show that most people don't care about it.. only people still left are the neckbeards
[6:31:30] Upcomin: it wouldnt
[6:31:36] jackymoon: Boo the man who thought of that lol
[6:31:39] SwitchBlue1337: It depends on how unique the mount and mog is.
[6:31:40] brian_777777777: people do the expansion title achievements those are more annoying and probably harder by my standard
[6:31:40] Rulem: I would prefer it, tbh
[6:31:42] Strugl3snugle24_: It would be way more than 1%.
[6:31:45] zuna1904: the race is all about the gear
[6:31:46] amishrifle14: screw that lol i am a mythic raider in wow and if i only get a mog and mount fuck it im out lmfao
[6:31:47] Wolfenhoof: If i get housing as well, i am fine with that^^
[6:31:47] Alt_slash: The loot in WoW raid rn is like useless, all BIS comes from M+ lol
[6:31:49] N3llee: depends on if there cheeves and those cheeve rewards
[6:31:52] zuna1904: because you need the gear to kill the bosses lol
[6:32:03] infinityarty: ur not queued
[6:32:05] Strugl3snugle24_: even bad players outside of the 1% care about progressing
[6:32:10] infinityarty: have to be out of combat
[6:32:11] RayenDark: Higher ilvl Bis weapons come from raids not M+
[6:32:15] Alt_slash: i wnat guild housing in WoW
[6:32:15] Crowargus: dude you only have a handful of guilds that can actuallyu clear a mythic raid in heroic gear rest of mythic raiders rely on upgrades to progreess
[6:32:17] Pablo1983: As Tally would say a shit show obvs
[6:32:28] Laluzmia: less
[6:32:31] Skorno: Skorno subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 23 months! 
[6:32:31] Biorrwolf: I'm here for the lore
[6:32:32] Laluzmia: LOL
[6:32:33] magultra: Depends on what the mount looks like :)
[6:32:35] Rulem: I hoenstly think the only way to get more to mythic raid would be to make the raid size smaller
[6:32:54] Blas0n: @Rulem this 100%
[6:33:03] Blas0n: its rough putting together a 25 man roster
[6:33:16] Architank: @Alt_slash Guild Housing would be nice
[6:33:17] moonlleek: normal raid should give 270 gear heroic 280 and mythic 282 so its still an upgrade but not that big
[6:33:19] llNoTToXiCll: @Alt_slash  yeah i never really was in favor for Mythic+ because it kinda almost invalidated going in to raids for me atleast
[6:33:23] atrexy_: Yeah i would like seeing a 10 man mythich raid
[6:33:28] Wolfenhoof: @Rulem Or force more masochists into gaming.
[6:33:30] zuna1904: @Crowargus dude.. they go 6+weeks in gear upgrades within the first  1-2 weeks of a new raid
[6:33:59] Ordicos: if that tier happen most of us will skip it and come back 2 tiers later and nuke it
[6:34:00] Crowargus: who zuna?
[6:34:12] Rulem: yep; so much unused content
[6:34:15] zuna1904: @Crowargus world first racer
[6:34:30] Architank: Going back and doing old dungeons at their original difficulty would be great.
[6:34:30] Crowargus: wat bout world 50?
[6:34:32] jackymoon: There focus should be on community and guilds.. and being in one having value.  so much of SL was the lack of people wanting to join and raid in the guild they are in.  Half of my AOTC in SL was having to pug half of the group
[6:34:57] ForsakenReign: the could add housing items to old raids to farm:D
[6:35:06] Architank: Guild could do old raids and get materials for the new crafting system. Timewalking raid events like the dungeons.
[6:35:08] iRumm: The main reason FFXIV can do old raids like that is they don't take 4 hours to do though eh
[6:35:09] zuna1904: @Crowargus not even close as hardcore
[6:35:12] iRumm: You're in and out
[6:35:14] jackymoon: I think old legendarys should be relevant
[6:35:20] DoubleNova: what would a mythic deadmines look like
[6:35:25] iRumm: WoW raids got 13 bosses and trash though
[6:35:33] Architank: LUL
[6:35:36] Akira_K_R: that be cool, like a perma Timewalking to all raids and dungeons in game, with continued added new loot
[6:35:41] jackymoon: Make blessed thunderfury
[6:35:48] jackymoon: and have it in new ilv
[6:35:52] zuna1904: ff14 has almost no trash. you join you spawn infront of the boss. you die ? you spawn infront of the boss
[6:35:52] Moobot: THE HAMMER SQUAD CROSS FACTION COMMUNITY! https://www.worldofwarcraft.com/invite/7Ypy9yXc3B3?region=US&faction=Horde | NA FOR NOW
[6:35:53] Fugazi811: Lul
[6:35:55] Jey1h: @ForsakenReign housing hopefully doesnt come for a while, so they make it good. I would rather not have housing compared to FF14's current housing system
[6:35:55] jackymoon: thats what i meant
[6:35:58] DoubleNova: legion kinda had it right?
[6:36:08] Pablo1983: Bronze and infinite dragon flight would fit it into the lore also
[6:36:45] F_L_A_K_E_: i miss them adding new bgs
[6:36:49] Rulem: is that the "casual" content in the game everyone talks about?
[6:36:55] iRumm: MoP was close - the cloak quest
[6:37:00] PvtHudson093: FF14 has a sale on with 30% off
[6:37:04] iRumm: Brought it up over the whole expansion
[6:37:08] HaxzorJimDuggan: was a more casual relic weapon for sure
[6:37:14] Jey1h: @DoubleNova Artifact appearances had it right, farming AP sucked ass
[6:37:37] llNoTToXiCll: @DoubleNova  legion had it right if it didnt have the Artifact weapon they were cool no doubt but it also took away from getting a sweet brand new weapon x D
[6:38:06] Jey1h: @Rulem Casual content in FF isnt really game content, its more player made content with RP/Housing etc.
[6:38:24] Rulem: @Jey1h ah., ok.
[6:38:40] llNoTToXiCll: but the mage tower was a brilliant idea for those Artifact weapons tho
[6:38:48] Syllvn: relic weapons would be the casuals bis. they take too long to use for progression. same in ff
[6:38:53] Tamz_tv: Fated Mythic raids are going to award 311 ilvl loot are we even going to replace that before 70?
[6:38:55] Rulem: I absolutely loved the legion artifact design.  I wasn't bothered at all with not seeing weapon drops
[6:39:10] Poriand: i bet they do
[6:39:22] relaption: thaldrakken
[6:39:23] TheCliffyShow: Bring back the Challenge Artifact appearances!
[6:39:24] The_Tacozilla: valdrakken
[6:39:28] Jey1h: biggest problem for me as a casual in FF14 is i cannot gather new transmogs. As you have a hardcap on the slots you have. Which sucks so hard. been 2 expansions now where i cannot gather new gear for looks.
[6:39:29] relaption: valdrakken
[6:39:32] relaption: close enough lol
[6:39:33] BillyBoosted: Valdraxxus
[6:39:41] oddworldaus: @Towelliee are you keen o the new wow?
[6:39:53] wastedcause91: usually the endgame mythic stuff takes awhile to replace while leveling
[6:40:16] llNoTToXiCll: hows the talent system working does it feel better than the 6 or 7 talents to choose from
[6:40:39] daiblor: God I miss playing ele shaman
[6:40:44] strike879: i like the mage tower but like the first one you should be able to out gear it let the early ppl get an extra title or something but eventually everyone that puts in the effort should be able to complete it
[6:40:47] tposingsnorlax: @Towelliee Which of the 2 current dungeons are you enjoying the most atm?
[6:40:51] Storm_Taker: Hello all
[6:40:56] WHJustice: Warlord Sargma nutz
[6:41:04] Gezber: @daiblor is it bad in SL? i only play enhance
[6:41:16] Storm_Taker: stormtaker__ subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 5 months, currently on a 3 month streak! Morning all
[6:41:30] daiblor: @gezber I have no idea. I haven’t played in ten years lol!
[6:41:39] Gezber: damn
[6:41:44] AlphasaurusRexx: @strike879 anyone that puts the effort in currently can do it. it was a joke at the end of legion
[6:41:45] Crowargus: uldaman im not looking fwd to in m_
[6:41:53] Jey1h: @Towelliee did you see SE making a NFT of cloud from FF7?
[6:41:59] noiseco: yeah
[6:42:07] Exxcar: @Towelliee what you think they could do at this point to make Ulda more enjoyable?
[6:42:14] llNoTToXiCll: @Towelliee  hows the talent system working does it feel better than the 6 or 7 talents to choose from
[6:42:28] oddworldaus: thought's on the new wow? @Towelliee
[6:42:29] Boraal: one note I think you're putting too much priority on lightning bolt and leaving charges of lava burst unused.  I could be wrong but that's how ele usually goes
[6:42:46] Exxcar: @Towelliee yeah that's my concern

[6:42:51] vluggejaapie89: less trash
[6:42:57] Exxcar: I commonly hear that its just way too long
[6:43:04] Rafael_Inacio: maybe less trash
[6:43:07] TheCliffyShow: I don't mind long dungeons as long as they are fun and interesting.
[6:43:08] AlphasaurusRexx: @Boraal yea, ST you prioritize lava burst
[6:43:15] TrustyTea: do you think itll be part of the m+ rotation?
[6:43:20] toobaked1987: Scrap Uldman no one wants it!
[6:43:54] Boraal: I'd take a new BRD dungeon over Uldaman
[6:43:58] llNoTToXiCll: Great that is truly good to hear
[6:44:08] TheCliffyShow: @toobaked1987 I've seen a lot of people seem interested in it.
[6:44:09] Rafael_Inacio: corruption at the end was sooooooooooooooooooooo good
[6:44:12] Higgymonster: I want to be able to play a smite priest damnit
[6:44:12] wanderingfox: @Boraal as long as it isn't 10 hours long lol
[6:44:23] xch4se: @Towelliee are your alpha logs public?
[6:44:27] llNoTToXiCll: yeah
[6:44:28] PvtHudson093: Pure Mastery/Crit Ret Paladin
[6:44:43] llNoTToXiCll: thats awesome
[6:44:50] Towelliee: https://www.warcraftlogs.com/reports/ZBRtYXyGazr4HF7d/
[6:44:52] TheCliffyShow: Is that suppose to be Zappy Boy or just a generic troll.
[6:45:22] martianxl: Are you able to swap build in the middle of a run?  So AOE build and a single target build?
[6:45:25] oddworldaus: will you be playing the new class when the new wow comes out?
[6:45:33] xch4se: Hahah thanks! I will be your emotional support tank again anytime ha
[6:45:39] lynixxis: EoA testing. Damn.
[6:45:39] llNoTToXiCll: see  i always knew they could make a talent system and i'm very happy they took that direction because you are right it does bring more customization
[6:45:41] strchsr: is this Eye of Azshara
[6:45:56] TheCliffyShow: @martianxl No. Have to be in a rested area like before.
[6:46:45] mavericks312: so will we see towelmage in DF
[6:46:45] Moobot: towHAMUP Follow Towelliee on twitter so you can be in the know at all times! | twitter.com/towelthetank towKawaii
[6:46:53] tposingsnorlax: @Towelliee Which one do you prefer there, then? Ele or enhance?
[6:47:03] TacDuc: Elemental is one of my favorite DPS specs, pretty fun IMO
[6:47:06] llNoTToXiCll: So what i'm seeing here is you have main shammy talents and Actual spec customization that is sweet
[6:47:19] Exxcar: @martianxl Blizzard has already said they just haven't implemented it. The intent is that you will be able to switch between your builds freely outside combat. You can only CREATE and Alter the builds in a rested area
[6:47:22] notColt45: twice the hammers!
[6:47:24] trailerparkkgamer: why the mage hate
[6:47:37] banjlolz: do we have any news for other talent trees or nothing yet?
[6:47:43] TheCliffyShow: Is that Zakhan in the Elemental talent tree background or just a generic troll?
[6:47:43] THEBUSHYHEAD: I plan to main enhance
[6:47:48] relaption: im still salty enchance got doomhammers but arms warrior didnt get gorehowl
[6:47:49] rudericus: Toweliee which class/spec have you enjoyed the most thus far?
[6:47:50] Rexpiereor: Why not 70 yet KEKW
[6:47:56] llNoTToXiCll: nice
[6:47:59] Exxcar: @banjlolz So far its been with each alpha build, so next week sometime hopefully
[6:48:17] Rexpiereor: I'm am 70 in TBC
[6:48:20] ijuki: @Rexpiereor slootHmm
[6:48:22] TacDuc: 70 buff in dungeons otherwise people are lower than 70
[6:48:36] TheCliffyShow: I would have loved Gorehowl as Arms Artifact.
[6:48:36] Razor9mm: Gorehowl been in the game for 15 years
[6:48:37] rei__03: LUL
[6:48:37] TacDuc: Heh

[6:48:59] Anxxius: hows dk in alpha?
[6:49:15] TacDuc: @strchsr That sword is so fucking cool, but it would be sad to lose it after Legion
[6:49:19] banjlolz: @banjlolz i want my paladin/dh talents xD
[6:49:24] relaption: @strchsr fury getting shalamayne and arms getting gorehowl would be my wet dream

[6:50:12] Gapplebees1: @Towelliee It's all about to change anyways, wouldn't put much time at all into Hunter at the moment.
[6:50:49] Shuttlelol: blue boy is good dps? nice
[6:51:59] Shuttlelol: the class needs 1 or 2 more abilities i feel
[6:52:03] Shuttlelol: it feels so lite
[6:52:51] paravak: Still got more than demon hunter ha

[6:53:00] DoubleNova: maybe it's intentionally the easy class
[6:53:15] BTiZZY_: y’all must forget DH which is basically two buttons if your other moves are on cd lol
[6:53:24] Polebegood: the advanced class is the easy one?
[6:53:25] dantezalive: you have to type ADVANCED to play it tho lol
[6:53:48] vic_ave: if you think DH 2 keys you playing it wrong
