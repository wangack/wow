[0:19:00] zerozuckerl: good evening Xar
[0:19:01] Hellacat: broke boys celebrate
[0:19:04] MrCtrlAlt: Banning GDKP's is such a bandaid fix to the real issue which is botting and gold sellers
[0:19:08] MrEyde: Cheer100
[0:19:13] capt_allberries: are you still using the old hardcore add on
[0:19:17] Cheatoy: we need comments on the rest of the blizzard notes on SoD p2

[0:19:22] HarryJPotter94: hi Xar
[0:19:31] bonathan114: banning GDKP dramatically reduces demand for buying gold
[0:19:31] primatemelissa: Ssf will fix that
[0:19:32] Parrapara: You plan on watching Barneys new upcoming series when it comes out?
[0:19:34] meatbe4t: @xaryu it's actually just a ''pun'' if you want the beat is for music beat not beating haha so it'S like Meat music or wtv .. don't search too far
[0:19:34] peterp4rkeer: why do you think people buy gold? to join a gdkp and buy items LUL
[0:19:34] xise_umad: HUH
[0:19:35] Sauzes: I dont think its a bandaid I think its more in conjunction of

[0:19:44] DendeDewd: SUS
[0:19:45] Roaming_Radiance: TACKLONG**
[0:19:45] ZIMdb_: GDKPs are good for the playerbase if the gold people use if earned legit.
[0:19:46] uncleavi: hit it really really hard
[0:19:47] Drakothius: what do you mean exactly HUH
[0:19:47] leonwaltt: approaching from the back and front
[0:19:49] abs0lemtv: What you like the most about the new things on Phase 2?
[0:19:49] taylorsdank: they're eiffel towering it
[0:19:50] LizardoiL: They are doubleteaming it
[0:19:50] Roaming_Radiance: Tackling*

[0:19:52] viciouswx: HeyGuys
[0:19:54] User3600: They are attacking from both flanks
[0:19:54] mrpubrehab: morning zar!! so I seen you died, are you gunna run shaman again? or trying something different?

[0:20:03] yami_yugi_87: the good'ol DP
[0:20:04] bonathan114: banning GDKP dramatically reduces demand for buying gold though
[0:20:07] NaiyaBelle: how are they banning them tho? are they going to just rely on reports?
[0:20:07] LizardoiL: It's double penetration
[0:20:07] MrCtrlAlt: I don't buy gold BECAUSE I run GDKP's, so I just raidlog and still get the gold I need to keep up LUL
[0:20:08] lasagnalord13: help i cant buy my gear
[0:20:08] uncleavi: lee run to the center
[0:20:10] primatemelissa: How did you die?
[0:20:15] flandril: multi-faceted
[0:20:16] koctopus: removing gdkp removes a part of the desire for people to want to use RMT for gold
[0:20:22] tonycheese_: double penetration
[0:20:23] JaysonCarmona: Phase 2 goals for you? Any RP you want to do?
[0:20:28] Rizdk: Does anyone play Sod SSF Harcore on EU? Is there aguild for that?
[0:20:30] xise_umad: How do you even remove gdkps tho
[0:20:35] Yahfz: HUH
[0:20:38] Teostrasz: mage boosting is more gold into the economy than gdkps
[0:20:44] Saravyn: In my single minded opinion, GDKP bad, and if you are upset that they are banned you were probably a gold buyer.
[0:20:48] viciouswx: DP pog
[0:20:48] Teostrasz: so really gold buying isnt stopping
[0:20:53] meatbe4t: Mage boosting will be wild in p2
[0:20:55] abs0lemtv: What did you like the most about the new things on phase 2?
[0:20:56] Ebonhawke7: im so hype for p2 pvp

[0:21:04] Roaming_Radiance: Too bad Xarstomp never got to taste the GLORY OF WINDFURY
[0:21:05] Nefenn: Wrong lmao
[0:21:11] Tracy_83_: no shot
[0:21:13] limburgse: so wrong 😂
[0:21:16] AsianButHigh: anal what he said
[0:21:18] booneytoonz: That sounds like someone mad they cant run GDKPs anymore
[0:21:22] Saravyn: F for Xarstomp
[0:21:23] Ableton_EU: @Xaryu have you checked out the p2 runes yet? :)
[0:21:23] MrCtrlAlt: A mage boosting for one hour is the average BFD gdkp pot, which can only be done once every 3 days @Xaryu
[0:21:27] Hellacat: ahmpy was making way more gold/hour boosting than running gdkp full time, one anecdote
[0:21:28] kyleuselton: @Xaryu is being a parent all that you expected hows the nights
[0:21:29] conkqt: Hey Xar choose my next SoDcore class!!!!!
[0:21:29] shiggydoo43: go again!
[0:21:33] lampsterof79: Ahmpy will be sadge
[0:21:36] nocontrast: peolple buy boosts to have alts to farm GDKPs with
[0:21:36] Saravyn: @booneytoonz exactly they mad cuz they gold buyers /s
[0:21:37] handovdoom666: morning Xaryu
[0:21:39] NaiyaBelle: idk how they are going to ban them
[0:21:40] primatemelissa: @rizdk there is! On lava lash, the guild is also called SodCore

[0:21:47] tullinatorlive: I love it
[0:21:48] Ableton_EU: W
[0:21:49] tullinatorlive: I hate GDKPS
[0:21:49] Parrapara: dont spoil him guys
[0:21:51] Xaryu: !elwood
[0:21:51] StreamElements: Xaryu's basic tees and sweatshirts are from https://elwdclo.com/xaryu use code XARYU10 for 10% off
[0:21:51] AwakenRevelation: I did a GDKP run when I started playing WoW in Wotlk because I wasn't in a guild but it seemed fair and reasonable to me. Maybe this is for the more extreme or shady ones?
[0:21:52] DuckTwelve: looks cozy
[0:21:54] nemcoy: content milker LUL
[0:21:55] efracozz: good decision
[0:22:00] mrpubrehab: zar! where is Mitch jones???
[0:22:00] Teostrasz: thats a good perspective actually, mages boost more ppl cause a lot of them are gdkp alts
[0:22:01] spokie: GDKP still going to be relevant through already established discord servers but atleast it will minimize it by people being scared of losing their accounts
[0:22:02] Teostrasz: good point
[0:22:02] RenogadeEU: neither are gold into the economy, they are both just trading gold. only vendoring items or doing quests injects gold into the economy
[0:22:03] limburgse: litterly nobody wants to get those “mageboosts” on my server. mages ask way to many g for it… 5g per RFC run ☠️
[0:22:04] meatbe4t: True streamer
[0:22:09] mistahfrank: please start with the news already man!

[0:22:20] taylorsdank: that takes will power
[0:22:24] Knocktoff: is kai excited about the phase 2 reveal
[0:22:25] pwndatr0nz: I feel like people who ran GDKP legitmately are the only ones punished cause people who buy gold will just run them through discord
[0:22:25] viciouswx: xarPain
[0:22:26] ZIMdb_: you do really well fighting the feeling of FOMO
[0:22:29] conkqt: Xar choose my next SoDcore class attempt!

[0:22:48] shiggydoo43: its always good to send that shit underground
[0:22:50] bigld8848: xarHey

[0:59:31] Tropicocity: Druid Runes : Eclipse increases the critical strike chance of your next two Wrath abilities by 30% and Wrath increases the critical strike chance of your next Starfire by 30% with each effect stacking up to 4 times. King of the Jungle fundamentally changes your Tiger's Fury by increasing all physical damage you deal by 15%, as well as instantly granting you 60 energy. As a trade-off for this, Tiger's Fury now has a 30 second cooldown.

[1:13:18] sengip: No More GDKP Runs We are experimenting with a new policy which will no longer allow GDKP runs in Season of Discovery. While we understand that there are some benefits for those who find this a convenient way to gain gear, we also recognize that there are concerns surrounding the erosion of traditional guild and social structures that are a part of the spirit of Season of Discovery.

[1:14:48] zer0_the_legend: 50 is is too much imo
[1:14:50] Woah_Zerk: WWWW
[1:14:50] berserage95: 50% buff level 1-25 is the perfect example of how bad classic players are LUL
[1:14:51] AbsoluteDespair: @Pixiepantss Its a seasonal server
[1:14:51] Naxonus: @Pixiepantss eh not a big deal with it only until 25
[1:14:54] larnsmarf: awww all the RFC boosters
[1:14:54] Avulsionn: @Fynn_Wolfsheart yeah for sure it's basically the end of the expac so sod is very welcome, dragonflight did rebuild my interest though after whatever shadowlands was
[1:14:54] Xzanelol: @squirtlesquirt are you ok?
[1:14:55] AbsoluteDespair: 50% is good for seasonal
[1:14:58] basic94: i hope you can turn that buff off
[1:14:59] YamajiTV: i dont think it is a W, the 50%
[1:14:59] sircrumpler: 1-10 is gonna literally take 10 minutes OMEGLAUL
[1:15:00] Pixiepantss: yap yap yap
[1:15:01] bigwilly3737: this shit isnt even gonna feel like classic its gonna feel like a private server
[1:15:02] cropod: people want to suffer? how is 50 too much LUL
[1:15:04] YamajiTV: the zone gonna be dead
[1:15:11] clownworldd: 1-25 is already fast
[1:15:13] Mahca_: still time to farm epic staff
[1:15:13] drummond777: its a seasonal game. 50% is fine
[1:15:14] tyrone710: W leveling raid actually helps level thats awesome
[1:15:18] bwillyboy: raid xp is something i always thought was a good idea
[1:15:19] hekalaios: the BFD thing is not so cool
[1:15:19] butterzugzug: @bigwilly3737 thats the whole point of discovery
[1:15:22] hagspretten: @clownworldd now its 10 hrs faster :)
[1:15:28] AiceFIrst: Hi Xar!
[1:15:29] Zijkrial: I get why exp boosts happen, but I feel like every version of WoW except HC treats leveling as a negative. Hm.
[1:15:29] faxekondilover3: @copper_cloud done nothing of those, not tryharding/sweating and just having a good time. Way better than retail :P
[1:15:30] Threeliters: keeps BFD buffs dropping too
[1:15:33] YeahTomi: What happens when the Twitch drop timer ends and I have 5% left because that's what it's looking to be like BibleThump
[1:15:33] Pixiepantss: NODDERS
[1:15:37] cropod: this just makes me wanna play the game more
[1:15:43] bigwilly3737: @butterzugzug then go play retail if you dont want classic easy as that dont turn classic into retail lol
[1:15:43] berserk_val: i wonder how long that will be good xp fdor
[1:15:45] SarcasticApe: YEP W
[1:15:45] Mahca_: they said it’s good till mid 30s
[1:15:47] butterzugzug: @hekalaios it's upon completion, not grinding mobs in the raid
[1:15:48] copper_cloud: @faxekondilover3 u wouldnt know cope if it smacked you in the face
[1:15:48] defiantfate: @hekalaios they said in the beginning it's a Level-Up Raid same with Gnomeregan what did you expect no xp for a Level-Up Raid?
[1:15:49] larnsmarf: @hekalaios youll be hapy about it. when 3 months from now itll be impossible to get a group
[1:15:49] berserk_val: o
[1:15:51] Demisozz: they said something about raid size on phase 2?
[1:15:52] Naxonus: 1-25 takes like a week for casuals, most of us in chat are not casuals, 50% buff is perfect for them until 25
[1:15:52] swolygh0st: i will be doing BFD at 40 still looking for my staff FeelsBadMan
[1:15:53] kajjind: midder range 30's

[1:16:09] ruperttheyeti: doubt itll be done leveling, the sweats will be like *must be lvl 40, gear score 450+" etc
[1:16:10] SlapdickWoWplayer: @Demisozz 10 man

[1:16:20] dado_inc: and you get the worldbuff
[1:16:22] tyrone710: Its to help with late comers or alts which i kinda like. Keeps people coming in
[1:16:23] littlehak: can have more than one at a time?
[1:16:24] squarepusher_: no one is going to run BFD for xp since they're going to be in suboptimal leveling gear.
[1:16:27] kjozz: i have 28 waylaid supplies filled up in my bank rdy for turn in
[1:16:27] thatdogbitme: xp buffs for capped content  FeelsBadMan

[1:16:46] butterzugzug: @bigwilly3737 you missunderstood. Private servers are so popular bc of adjustments. not everyone is there to be good but they are trying things out and this is amazing
[1:16:54] hekalaios: @hekalaios I just think now I will feel to be forced to do BFD again and again. but sure thats my problem

[1:25:38] jesusjammys: You can easily enforce it if they investigate and ban these players, others will be detered to do it
[1:25:39] AnyroadTwo: Enforcing is kinda easy I think. GDKPs rely on strangers as customers. any stranger could report the GDKP. they can also loot at transactions and ask why large sums of gold traded hands.

[1:25:42] Nonprophetx: its not hard to flag accounts after multiple bfd runs and gold going out to everyone in the raid. they can see what/who you trade.
[1:25:43] SlapdickWoWplayer: New bluepost on it now
[1:25:47] shadowthehedgehog97: i dont like the way they are enforcing the gdkp ban
[1:25:49] slapshotsd: oh my god guys nobody is getting banned for gdkp'ing privately in their own community, it just prevents public advertising of it to strangers
[1:25:49] drinkingcoldbeer: this removes all incentives for me to run a pug after i get bis... why do it??
[1:25:50] tywilldoittv: @Xaryu They just dropped a blue post 5 mins ago with the new GDKP policy
[1:25:51] Spikeqc: what D:
[1:25:53] rankdusty: @berserage95 wont drop it 95% LOL you must be new ? servers will just have gdkp discord servers per realm LOL you new to this ?
[1:25:53] B_Rize: GDKPS aren’t even a bad thing lol people will just buy more gold since they can’t make it anymore in raids
[1:25:53] Dexart: Streamer get the loot anyway right? :P
[1:25:54] Reaperz_kinetic: @nikola420tesla brother you don’t really know what you’re talking about. I understand where you’re coming from but you’re not knowledgeable on the subject
[1:25:57] fetza108: big W
[1:26:02] SavageOG1: pay2  win
[1:26:03] wookinit: anyone who likes gdpks are buying gold.
[1:26:05] RuskoBanane: a pay to win
[1:26:07] Wolfinosg: pay to win game
[1:26:09] captdangles420: Pay 2 win
[1:26:11] TheMysticBean: Why not ban GDKP in wrath as well tho? because blizz already put the gold token in? Kappa
[1:26:11] Hellacat: applies to the Auction house.
[1:26:12] grubols: it also make it impossible to get into raids
[1:26:14] Zijkrial: Bot money floods the market quicker.
[1:26:16] vision42g: those ppl made me so much gold tho KEKW
[1:26:16] Bababoey000: pay 2 win
[1:26:17] vilness: Immersion. it add monetary value to gameplay
[1:26:18] RobRoads: I bought, and got caught. Shame on me. I'll never do it again. 15 day ban
[1:26:18] berserage95: @rankdusty i love people like you who think because you do something everyone else does it, u are such a minority i wish you had a brain to figure that out
[1:26:18] Tybow0811: It doesnt stop people from buying gold though
[1:26:19] Loodimus: Not the mention the influx of gold creates inflation on items making it incredibly difficult for legit players
[1:26:20] Muttermundharmonika168: @Xaryu not exactly right... GDKPS can also be a farm method. And people use gold for consumables to trihard
[1:26:21] king___slender: @B_Rize such a bad take LUL
[1:26:21] daigurren2: This wont stop it though.... will just change how people buy gear by making it through carries....
[1:26:21] slapshotsd: @rankdusty do you not see how that is different from it being the status quo advertised in trade chat
[1:26:24] Zijkrial: Yep
[1:26:24] detourz28: Most GDKP buyers are gold buyers
[1:26:24] dr_g_ttv: We’re not all streamers who get given gold by viewers or play for 10 hours a day, we have full time jobs and just want to play the game lol
[1:26:24] CoachHuck: I've never gotten to do a RAID, but this sounds like a huge W
[1:26:26] jacksunson: bots also destory farming for non-bots. super annoyings
[1:26:26] bigwilly3737: no ones getting banned for doing gdkps lol their just gonna do it on discord and call it something else
[1:26:28] abatement454: you can sell raid spots and that won't be considered a gdkp
[1:26:28] Udenwo: AGREE
[1:26:33] Darksyde1029: @B_Rize Wrong. GDKPs are one of the main driving forces that encourages gold buying. Gold buying will decline almost certainly without them because what else do you really need that much gold for in classic? Nothing really.
[1:26:34] dimsy__: rare blizz w yepBanana
[1:26:34] Spikeqc: ppHop ppHop ppHop ppHop
[1:26:35] thatdogbitme: @wookinit agreed, no gkdp's running now are inviting non-buyers
[1:26:37] brie_feusang: @vilness I don't want my gameplay to have monetary value bro I want to fucking play the game
[1:26:38] onlyNoxm: but you can buy gold legit
[1:26:38] snarlins: what about purchased gold for boosting?
[1:26:40] Hellacat: Auction house shows inflation of RMT. not just raid loot
[1:26:40] Ethrealss: yep world doesn’t exist in a vacuum
[1:26:41] SirKalikan: I loved them when I was an AH goblin.
[1:26:41] tywilldoittv: @Xaryu They just dropped a blue post 5 mins ago with the new GDKP policy
[1:26:43] onlyNoxm: with the token
[1:26:45] enigmasvea: @Xaryu they just released more info
[1:26:46] lumi929: True
[1:26:47] shadowthehedgehog97: @bigwilly3737 murder is illegal but there are still people being murdered
[1:26:48] TheFox0228: no gold buying GDKPs are great. but they're instantly ruined by back actors Blizz doesn't do crap about.
[1:26:53] socketslol: As a GDKP host of 2000+ members I have built a fantastic community and the gold buyers still arent as bad as people think. There isint GOLD Whales in the quantity that people exagerate! @Xaryu
[1:27:00] nyypsycho: with the rmt the inflation just goes crazy
[1:27:01] Grashh: @onlyNoxm There is no token in SoD, only wrath
[1:27:02] Tydus_HW: and bots
[1:27:03] haptic_g: TRUE. initially it was a cool community created thing
[1:27:03] Zijkrial: GDKPs are too intrinsically tied to gold buying. It's unfortunate.
[1:27:04] larnsmarf: to think theres some dude out there who bought his house sellin gold to nerds
[1:27:08] Shiaco: We’re defining GDKP as any raid or dungeon run where items are awarded in exchange for gold. Please note that we have multiple detection methods for GDKP that are effective both inside and outside of dungeon or raid instances.
[1:27:09] wookinit: yepo
[1:27:09] berserage95: i quit sod 2 weeks after it came out cause gdkps and zero content LUL
[1:27:09] TheFamilyAffair: @socketslol lies
[1:27:11] melvinguyy: i really dont see it as good even if gold buying wasnt a thing. having to farm gold sucks
[1:27:11] bigwilly3737: @Darksyde1029 lmao this will not cut down on gold buyers and bots copium wow players
[1:27:14] grubols: @socketslol not the point st all lol
[1:27:16] Naxonus: It's a cool and interesting example of emergent player behavior but has been twisted into a RMT nightmare @Xaryu
[1:27:17] zer0_the_legend: And gold buying perpetuates botting which ruins the in game economy
[1:27:24] leiron_10: like Government
[1:27:25] sircrumpler: I don't get ppl who stop raiding after getting all the gear. I still do regardless! I never needed to get paid
[1:27:26] mistahfrank: gdkp and get all loot quick. normal raid and get all your loot in 1 year. or be a streamer and get loot instant
[1:27:30] Runekdabest: @Grashh still makes it legal way to buy gold since u can legaly swap gold from wrath/retail to sod so
[1:27:30] Barleycorned: @socketslol xmaybe just find a new hobby then
[1:27:34] HugzGG: @berserage95 you prolly woulda quit regardless tho tbf
[1:27:34] Loodimus: INFLATION IS TOO DAMN HIGH
[1:27:36] kushvendor44: The new blue post talks a little more about this
[1:27:37] daigurren2: @wookinit If you are a carry you can sign up on Ahmpy's gdkp discord where they check your logs first. youre either bad or misinformed
[1:27:38] socketslol: As a GDKP host of 2000+ members I have built a fantastic community and the gold buyers still arent as bad as people think. There isint GOLD Whales in the quantity that people exagerate! - with 22 runs per week I had maybe 3-5 Whales playing - @Xaryu
[1:27:40] espi: Players can't farm gold to compete with gold buyers who buys from bot farmers
[1:27:40] chobinhood_: @socketslol the quantity doesnt matter, all the gold they purchased from bots is tainted and is spread amongst your "community"
[1:27:41] Seryam: just ban gold buyers instead
[1:27:42] Pixiepantss: yeeah
[1:27:43] Pixiepantss: same
[1:27:44] YamajiTV: so much well said @Xaryu  you explain it perfectly! totally agree with your take
[1:27:46] runnesvoid: gdkp almost (if not entirerly) ruined wow raiding experience
[1:27:46] B_Rize: @darksyde1029 People will still buy gold for consumes, enchants, AH gear, boosts, alts, etc etc. Banning GDKPs does nothing for RMT
[1:27:47] Relaxstraza: How are they going to detect GDKPs?
[1:27:48] adam_brisbane: yes they are
[1:27:49] Reaperz_kinetic: @bigwilly3737 yes it will you just don’t really get how the issue works
[1:27:51] general6slick: new blue post gives more info
[1:27:52] jacksunson: BLUEPOST
[1:27:52] king___slender: @Seryam you do both
[1:27:52] Pixiepantss: idk how they will do this
[1:27:52] sunny_lik: i dont have time to farm gold.... and my wife took my son away from me because i pushed him to farm gold for me! What should i do know ????
[1:27:52] voidtouched_93: @socketslol LIES
[1:27:52] tywilldoittv: @Xaryu They just dropped a blue post 5 mins ago with the new GDKP policy

[1:28:03] zephyshomm: gdkp is good if people dont rmt
[1:28:08] Pixiepantss: link?
[1:28:10] barakk14: What about carry runs where you buy all loot of a certain type and carry runs? In the past tons of people would sell tanking/healer services that are on the edge
[1:28:12] Darksyde1029: @bigwilly3737 Removing a major incentive for gold buying will absolutely reduce the demand for gold meaning less people will buy gold. You're just ignorant if you don't see this is the case.
[1:28:13] SunderOsiris: so if u offer someone who won a roll like 25g for the item you can get banned now?
[1:28:14] Spikeqc: DatSheffy 9
[1:28:15] Exusprime: Your getting reported modCheck your getting reported
[1:28:15] Pixiepantss: ty
[1:28:17] grubols: as long as they r out of trade I’m happy
[1:28:26] sircrumpler: @mistahfrank imo the whole point of vanilla is that loot is SUPPOSED to be slow. It's supposed to take a long time for upgrades. Instant buyout of every slot is against the nature of vanilla imo
[1:28:26] wookinit: no player should be trading large amounts of gold. services are not that much
[1:28:28] evildufus: xarHmm xarHmm xarHmm
[1:28:31] bigwilly3737: @Reaperz_kinetic i do but banning gdkps isnt viable their just gonna do it on discord and get around it easy its not hard to do a gdkp and not call it one
[1:28:39] dan2cozy: why is it impossible to find this video on youtube? lol
[1:28:43] slapshotsd: @grubols right? like of course this stuff will still happen somewhere, but it's not gonna clog trade chat 24/7

[1:29:26] Johnvanhinten: if they ban only GDKP ppl will just buy flowers for gold and bid with flowers LUL
[1:29:27] Puffypuffs: i quit sod a few weeks after people cleared BFD for the first time cose i wanted to take my time getting my prebis while being full solo and guildless, vast majority of pugs were gdkp based and i never bothered trying BFD for that reason.
[1:29:27] nikola420tesla: They can detect GDKP's but cant do anything about Bots?? KEKW KEKW
[1:29:27] Kuijano: If they tell us the methods, people will figure out how to evade

[1:30:10] Nungiven: How do you accidentally do it
[1:30:11] Barleycorned: maybe they will start using the auction house to trade the gold over
[1:30:11] shabomination: Take the item away and dont give the gold back
[1:30:12] layzerbandit: i mean its including so i would assume it would be people who maybe are repeat offenders
[1:30:12] muzzy88: @Xaryu what if we pay using silver?

[1:30:19] Spikeqc: quid pro quo  ok
[1:30:20] bennybe: Cant trade gold in instance, leaving instance soulbounds items
[1:30:20] kirk_hunts: I like personal loot a lot tbh
[1:30:20] sircrumpler: Staysafe did make a point: what if you wanna buy an item off someone who won a roll? Does that count? @xaryu .
[1:30:20] Tydus_HW: someones gonna get banned in the crossfire
[1:30:21] bigwilly3737: 90% of you ppl typing W did multiple gdkps during p1 and got most of your gear from them lol

[1:30:22] pinkos4thestate: Good
[1:30:22] gi_wesp: remove gold trading inside raids
[1:30:22] typer___iban: no trading gold inside, no trading items outside instance, seemed smart
[1:30:22] KhanoTV: MAKE IT SO YOU CANT TRADE IN A RAID AND WHEN YOU LEAVE RAID THE GEAR IS LOCKED
[1:30:22] grebby71: gdkp players you can still do it in every other game mode, stop crying
[1:30:22] Thabab040: there has to be a ingame notice or smth because not everyone reads those patchnotes
[1:30:24] smashdakeys: smashdakeys subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 17 months! No half measures.
[1:30:25] Greencaps07: wait it say for gold so and i give you mats for the bid?

[1:30:30] BullzeyeWoW: Once you leave dungeon you cqnt trade
[1:30:30] Libertas09: Won't ban gold buyers, will ban GDKP buyers lmao
[1:30:31] Deomas11: Make it so loot cannot be traded 60 secs after the last boss is killed.
[1:30:32] oJNelly: No we need to keep master loot, thT was bad change in retail
[1:30:33] Exusprime: ICANT accidentally everyone in the group traded me gold for items, wasnt my fault
[1:30:34] picanhatv: cant trade gold inside instance -> item cant be traded once u zone out
[1:30:35] Octane33: Loot token curbs this a little right?
[1:30:35] B_Rize: GDKPS will never die
[1:30:36] kleardeath: someone said, make items not tradeable after you leave a dungeon and dont allow gold trading inside the dungeons
[1:30:37] evildufus: That's good, it makes it scary to try
[1:30:38] evandariel: it probably looks for gold giving during the 2hr trade window after raid
[1:30:39] nilsolof123: Why is it so bad to ban them for doing that? :)
[1:30:39] Mr_McWeasel: you have to slowly teach players that buying gold is for shitheads
[1:30:40] pinkos4thestate: Goooooooooood
[1:30:40] larnsmarf: if you buy/sell gold go back to NEW WOLRD

[1:30:47] wookinit: @sosa_4 sure buddy jsut go take your gold buying ass to another game loser
[1:30:49] hellseesyou: look at blizz doing wow token ph 3 :)
[1:30:49] king___slender: payoGtfo payoGtfo payoGtfo payoGtfo payoGtfo
[1:30:50] Slyxen: Grays said "remove trading gold in dungeons and remove being able to trade dungeon items outside of dungeons"
[1:30:50] pixixx1: I'm sure no one will buy gold anymore
[1:30:50] jesusjammys: There will be no way to circumvent detection unless blizz decides not to enforce it
[1:30:51] UnsafeCell: now we can finally play the game
[1:30:52] Sablehawk_TV: Eventually
[1:30:53] socketslol: As a GDKP host of 2000+ members in my discord, I have built a fantastic community and the gold buyers still aren't as bad as people think. There isint GOLD Whales in the quantity that people exaggerate! - with 22 runs per week I had maybe 3-5 Whales playing - @Xaryu
[1:30:55] polesreport: go play mobile games P2W andys
[1:30:58] drewlester007: 1. Can's trade gold in dungeons / raids.
[1:31:00] TheMysticBean: @kleardeath Then trade the items inside the dungeon and the gold outside? lol changes nothing
[1:31:01] notyourartist: says at this time

[1:31:06] polesreport: @socketslol stop spamming
[1:31:07] sircrumpler: I don't think no gdkp in retail will ever be feasible
[1:31:07] Morzeey: @evandariel this makes sense
[1:31:07] Naxonus: @Pixiepantss just cause you don't doesn't mean countless others don't and it hurts the overall economy
[1:31:09] Vondrex: @socketslol no one carse
[1:31:11] timothyx000: L
[1:31:13] fetza108: yes

[1:31:14] thatdogbitme: send the gold buys back to Retail
[1:31:14] j_dizzledawg: if it goes to Wrath thats when i quit WOW for good. i gdkp in wrath to pay for my wow sub with wow token
[1:31:15] Zijkrial: I noped out of WoTLK partly due to how insanely prevalent high cost GDKPs here.
[1:31:16] Reaperz_kinetic: only people who don’t like this change or gold buying GDKP Andy’s… change my mind
[1:31:17] B_Rize: GKDP LIVES ON
[1:31:18] larnsmarf: time to abuse the TP
[1:31:19] Riv_VK: GDKP stocks down
[1:31:19] heyitsken_: can’t this just translate over to AH costs once GDKPs are banned. people will still want to sell / buy gold? xaryu
[1:31:20] Wolfinosg: soooooo many people will get butthurt
[1:31:20] grayscael: @socketslol good riddance gdkp loser

[1:31:27] pinkos4thestate: @socketslol don't be doing it in sod otherwise I hope you get banned
[1:31:28] berserage95: wow people in chat really think blizzard are trying to make absolutely 0 gdkps being ran
[1:31:29] Traetheden: If they ban GDKP i would probably come back to Cata
[1:31:29] BigbadKevin: @drewlester007 just trade it after the raid...
[1:31:30] drewlester007: 2. Drops become bound upon exit of dungeon / raid
[1:31:31] Deatharmor98: @j_dizzledawg Exactly why theyre banned
[1:31:31] brummE1337: @socketslol For what you know of sure, but thats it :)
[1:31:32] TheMysticBean: Blizz profit from GDKPS on wrath there's no way they roll it out for classic
[1:31:33] Teostrasz: Blizzard literally has a wow taken in retail and wotlk? you guys forget this lmao
[1:31:33] sosa_4: @wookinit  idiot if you drop a big BOE its a Big amount of gold . noob innecer buyed gold .
[1:31:35] warmupwarri0r: @polesreport yep, go to wrath, retail or ERA, we don't want you in SOD
[1:31:36] Darksyde1029: GDKP players MAD KEKW
[1:31:36] wookinit: Clap
[1:31:36] Teostrasz: token*
[1:31:37] Badbotqt: people are just gonna move gold around like shell companies until it ends on the right person
[1:31:37] kamuriz: @Xaryu they can just do it through Discord
[1:31:38] tywilldoittv: @Xaryu I'm nervous about inside raid detectives. What happens in the instance where you're in a pug MS>OS run and you lose a roll but the guy is willing to sell it to you for gold?
[1:31:38] Tehghost66512: do you think this will effect boosting and 1 on 1 dungeon drop selliing
[1:31:39] donnieg93: cringe af
[1:31:40] iPlayCuzFun: @Johnvanhinten how will you AD this? flower run ?

[1:31:43] bigtimerush_1989: now mitch cant play the game
[1:31:45] drinkingcoldbeer: so it will all just be done in discord...
[1:31:45] jaredfrasas93: Won't goldbuyers just purchase boosts instead of gdkps?
[1:31:48] antmd15: This is going to be impossible to enforce at large there will still be gdkp's. Ex; people have separate accounts where they give gold to the loot master on his seperate account
[1:31:52] d_droplet: @donnieg93 cry about it
[1:31:52] sunnysidescrambled: what am i going to do with my 50k gold tho
[1:31:52] sircrumpler: Staysafe did make a point: what if you wanna buy an item off someone who won a roll? Does that count? @xaryu
[1:31:54] BullzeyeWoW: W W W W W W W
[1:31:54] donnieg93: so if u type gdkp u get banned?
[1:31:54] wookinit: @sosa_4 yea and it sells on the AH get fucked
[1:31:54] drinkingcoldbeer: detective measures alone does nothing to stop it
[1:31:55] gory_xd: did I miss Uberdanger video?
[1:31:55] Spikeqc: they are bluffing ok
[1:31:55] Zerksyera: its a L, because if you dont wanna play GDKP yopu dont have to, there are many guilds doin it without gdkp
[1:31:58] Runekdabest: KEKW
[1:31:58] JazeraTV: he did
[1:31:59] btjc89: banning gdkp'ers but not botters is crazy.
[1:31:59] Spikeqc: Kapp
[1:31:59] Silverbrit: yo guys as an alliance, what US SOD server do I join?
[1:32:00] Pixiepantss: he did like 2 rofl
[1:32:00] Judeese: Yes he did
[1:32:00] timothyx000: then why geared ppl get into raid they’ll just afk
[1:32:00] Spikeqc: no Kapp
[1:32:01] handovdoom666: oh yes he did
[1:32:02] detourz28: He did a few
[1:32:02] bazzzzzzz: he were grinding them
[1:32:04] jujujay_myalias: I am very interested to see those detection methods in effect and especially if they will consider appeals..
[1:32:05] myfellowpurgers2: L add
[1:32:06] notyourartist: @Xaryu theres a GDKP guild on wild growth guild lol
[1:32:06] cyrusctff7: It’s not going to kill GDKP outright, but it will massively reduce the amount of them
[1:32:06] tsetse2fly: he did a few gdkps and then stopped
[1:32:06] UnsafeCell: Is selling legs of fangs counted as gdkp?
[1:32:07] brogaardni: Jokerds stream is over
[1:32:07] warmupwarri0r: @tywilldoittv shouldn't happen either. is exploitative, and encourages ninja looting
[1:32:11] Deathbloomzx: amphy gonna have to quit
[1:32:11] Spikeqc: they are bluffing ok
[1:32:11] shadowthehedgehog97: @antmd15 how many people are going to go to such lengths ?
[1:32:11] Saravyn: Until a snitch screengrabs discord and shows it to daddy blizzard
[1:32:12] Pixiepantss: no
[1:32:12] bigwilly3737: this will be impossible to enforce lol you guys thinking this will be an ez fix are copium
[1:32:13] Pixiepantss: yeah
[1:32:14] Spikeqc: Kapp
[1:32:15] CoachHuck: !Discord
[1:32:15] StreamElements: The Xaryu Community Discord -> discord.gg/xaryu
[1:32:15] bazzzzzzz: he was the creator of GDKP
[1:32:16] Reaperz_kinetic: chat is so ignorant it’s wild
[1:32:17] Prevara96: they can track trades easily
[1:32:17] Deomas11: All it takes is one rat to get 10 people banned. It won't be worth it, even on disc.
[1:32:17] sosa_4: @wookinit  Big taxe on ah . you dont know thé game noob
[1:32:18] assksun: fuck gdkp,thats why so many bots everywhere
[1:32:19] sengip: If you guys wanna watch the video xar just watched, here it is https://youtu.be/QgB_1DHWTCk
[1:32:19] Udenwo: I made 15g in mitch's GDKP lol
[1:32:21] elementixxx: how could they prove that it was gdkp? they could ban you for wahtever they want now
[1:32:21] vision42g: theres still gonna be gdkps they gotta ban carries too now they called guild carries nothing changed
[1:32:21] Xzanelol: he did it for content
[1:32:22] iPlayCuzFun: can happen, and thats fine, just the masses wont be forced to join gdkp's and thats a huge W
[1:32:25] Pixiepantss: mitch doesnt need gdkps :p
[1:32:25] Pepzsi: Yeah, what about boost ?
[1:32:27] biigredant: deathrolls ?
[1:32:28] Cozzar_89: Cozzar_89 subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 2 months, currently on a 2 month streak! 
[1:32:29] freemmodirectrs: @btjc89  i hear they are working on something for botters now
[1:32:30] BigbadKevin: @bazzzzzzz thats a cap
[1:32:32] Slyxen: more like Soda LUL
[1:32:33] polesreport: discord GDKPer going to get suspended and then start crying about being found out and suspended
[1:32:33] professorslime: so if I’m on my alt and the pearl drops for example and I offer the winner 10 gold for the pearl I’m now engaging in illegal gameplay? lol
[1:32:34] rollinsthechamp: @Xaryu Here the news are all summed up good in 1 post https://www.wowhead.com/classic/news/season-of-discovery-phase-2-preview-quality-of-life-runes-raid-loot-pvp-event-337423
[1:32:34] drdisagreeable: u can pay into a pot first they distribute at the end
[1:32:36] darkom31: yeah communicate off game and buy an neutral AH from each player for their cut
[1:32:37] twistedbinkz: @xaryu Sadarco on YT got banned for GDKP
[1:32:37] koctopus: prevent gold being traded or mailed between accounts from a month if they share a raid lockout
[1:32:37] bazzzzzzz: @BigbadKevin :D
[1:32:37] neonloon: I just don't believe they'll be able to track it or stop it, this is just to try and get people back and appease people that still somehow believe in them. I have 8 ads btw, not hearing what's going on lol
[1:32:38] socketslol: If I turn my GDKP Server offline I guarantee hundreds of people will just quit - 2000 player server - hundreds of weekly raiders... @Xaryu  idk how this is any good for anyone, nobody complains about whales and those that do clearly dont even GDKP
[1:32:41] leiferikson4541: just dont allow trades for raid items
[1:32:42] pinkos4thestate: Guess who is sneaking into illegal gskp to get people banned?!?!?!?!?!? This guy lmao
[1:32:42] drinkingcoldbeer: their solution to stop it is "detection" measures and a tos update?? what a fail
[1:32:43] Deomas11: All it takes is one rat to snitch on a secret GDKP. It won't be worth it
[1:32:45] leiferikson4541: with gold
[1:32:46] squarepusher_: You can't end what wasn't ever started.
[1:32:46] taylorsdank: last two GDKP's I saw mitch do he accidentally scammed himself
[1:32:48] jujujay_myalias: I am very interested to see those detection methods in effect and especially if they will consider appeals..
[1:32:50] heyitsken_: can’t this just translate over to AH costs once GDKPs are banned. people will still want to sell / buy gold? xaryu
[1:32:51] blazzedzz: Gdkp discord Rats will snitch people and discord servers out
[1:32:53] Spikeqc: they are bluffing ok
[1:32:54] Karpaa: enchanting will be popular
[1:32:54] warmupwarri0r: @professorslime yes, just give it to them or loot it. you essentially ninjad the item for gold reasons
[1:32:54] zer0_the_legend: @zerksyera you're not understanding all of the stuff that goes along with being able to buy gear. It perpetuates gold buying and botting for gold farming which make the game objectively worse
[1:32:55] paladan_tich: I dont think they will enforce no GDKP it will just make the player base more warry of it.
[1:32:55] hooden: Just make a item the "currency" And u can still do buy runs
[1:32:56] iPlayCuzFun: ist such a huge W
[1:32:56] kkzam: amphy leveled a million alts for gdkps RIP

[1:33:02] mdamazing22: they can track GDKPs but not gold buyers
[1:33:03] marvinmc420: @Xaryu perma banning GDKPers and not gold buyers is CRAZZZZZY
[1:33:04] bigwilly3737: its blizzard they wont get banned
[1:33:04] boph4: Those with full intentions of doing GDKP won't stop, nothing technical can block it they always have pen and paper.
[1:33:06] FrizzoRL: amphy is crying rn
[1:33:06] CHICKENARMSANDLEGS: they're definetely harder to do
[1:33:06] Weddzz: Does this include winning an item by rolling on it and then selling it to someone in the raid if they offer lots of gold for it?
[1:33:07] sengip: Blizzard will make an example of someone big. So be careful if you're a streamer @Xaryu
[1:33:08] Reaperz_kinetic: @professorslime that’s not what they’re talking about dude 😂😂 you’re trying to twist this into something it’s not
[1:33:08] warmupwarri0r: @socketslol you aren't that important man. people will still play

[1:33:17] Vichrinox: using discord wont matter, how would they advertise, it would cut down on 75% of the GDKP, it wont solve all but alot
[1:33:17] NomFries: all the gm's got fired, who gonna catch them
[1:33:19] catbalou2: There is nothing difficult here...they have made a rule to play this game..Break it permanent account ban

[1:35:14] Genghjs: Dont join gdkp, you might be degen but never the most degen
[1:35:14] Deomas11: Initially it will probably be secretly done, but all it takes is one snitch who's sore about loot to rat them out and ruin everything. It won't be worth it for majority of players to risk perma banning their account.
[1:35:14] socketslol: Or you wouldve rolled against 12 players and probably lost anyways @Xaryu  - Those gold buyers dont exist that much - I have 2000 ppl in my discord server as GDKP host and I have like 3 whales

[1:35:16] jujujay_myalias: I am very interested to see those detection methods in effect and especially if they will consider appeals..
[1:35:17] bakingbad: well what if they perma banned gold buyers instead of suspending them for two weeks like soda??
[1:35:18] thatdogbitme: @avengedsyn its almost like you ignored what he was saying

[1:35:19] Nicholas909: just dont join a GDKP atp
[1:35:21] sunny_lik: JUST GET USED TO IT
[1:35:21] chr47: that's how gdkps work, without goldbuyers people don't want to run gdkp's because they don't get enough gold from it
[1:35:24] surrena: i dont see problem, just dont join GDKP runs then

[1:35:43] CaptainWasssabi: no more gdkp raids?
[1:35:43] TheFamilyAffair: Anything pay-2-win related is bad for the game. The root of the problem though are bots & RMT - and not GDKP persee. Good change for now, at least in theory...

[1:35:45] bigtimerush_1989: W BLIZZARD GO PLAY RETAIL IF YOU DONT LIKE IT
[1:35:45] Nungiven: I sincerely hate gdkp
[1:35:46] papos: papos subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 6 months! 
[1:35:46] aeropresso: A friend of mine and I started a gdkp server in SoD. We don't engage in RMT. We figured it'd be a good way to get multiple runs on our alts while making some gold. Met a lot of cool people, yes some were obvs gold buyers, but it's been the most social experience I've had in WoW. Met quite a few legitimate players who were just good at the game. Built a small community of people who like to play like we do. Not mad about the ban, not protesting blizzard's choice, but their why is weird to me.
[1:35:47] KaiRacing2016: what about fly hackers ? :D
[1:35:47] Yeedoz: what about a tank selling tank services?
[1:35:47] woofwoof2121: even spending HOURS to farm gold just to potentially get a piece is lame as hell…. GDKP 100% ruin the game.
[1:35:48] Badbotqt: how much bought gold did you get from boosting arenas?
[1:35:48] socketslol: Or you wouldve rolled against 12 players and probably lost anyways @Xaryu - Those gold buyers dont exist that much - I have 2000 ppl in my discord server as GDKP host and I have like 3 whales

[1:36:52] Reaperz_kinetic: they wanna buy gold KEKW thats the other side
[1:36:52] socketslol: You probably wouldve rolled against 12 players and probably lost anyways @Xaryu - Those gold buyers dont exist that much - I have 2000 ppl in my discord server as GDKP host and I have like 3 whales
[1:36:52] Guydx: Amongold had a good point
[1:36:52] bigtimerush_1989: @sunny_lik be gone DEMON

[1:36:54] PMA_1: freedom
[1:36:55] timothyx000: then why geared ppl get into raid they’ll just afkL
[1:36:55] warmupwarri0r: @socketslol those 3 whales are why the others come. They buy gold and launder it.
[1:36:55] Genghjs: Ingame broke boys
[1:36:55] socketslol: L
[1:36:56] nachidru: wattch asomon's take on it
[1:36:56] larnsmarf: there was a guy agruging about his community
[1:36:56] Exusprime: swippers seething
[1:36:57] iRambo96: @Xaryu I like to be rewarded with gold if nothing drops for me
[1:36:58] Dochunk: BECAUSE MY WORK PAYS MORE THAN FARMING GOLD
[1:36:58] breezegodd: @Xaryu Casual gamers who are not buying gold take hit
[1:36:59] Jarovi_: GDKP Carriers
[1:36:59] Kuijano: It feels like an L because those are the biggest way I make money
[1:37:00] Badbotqt: not having to follow a guild schedule
[1:37:00] kajjind: aeropresso wrote some
[1:37:01] Visoth: GDKP isnt a problem if there wasnt gold buying/selling @Xaryu
[1:37:01] larnsmarf: sure hes got his copy pasta bullshit
[1:37:02] Deomas11: L can only be gold buyers lol
[1:37:02] lolo40001: No he does not
[1:37:02] Mico027: Literaly just go play the 4 other version of WoW if you wanna GDKP LUL
[1:37:03] hellseesyou: L it is because Blizzard is not solving the gold selling problem
[1:37:04] NawtyTyme: maybe they just dont like playing with people
[1:37:05] Harrychongdong: People will just find ways to hack the system in a worse way
[1:37:06] J3htro: he does not
[1:37:06] hagspretten: watch asmons video @Xaryu
[1:37:06] sumdumphuk: Running raids to make gold
[1:37:07] rhaziaa: I have bought gold before and been in quite a few GDKPs, but still think this is a W @Xaryu
[1:37:07] hellseesyou: they r killing a gdkp
[1:37:07] Austere_1: i mean i don't buy gold but i really liked being able to do quality pickup raids and make gold while doing the part of the game that's the most fun for me
[1:37:08] Naxonus: @Xaryu Asmon has kinda short vide on it, he disagrees with change
[1:37:08] everganaj: i bought gold i didnt feel like grinding come at me
[1:37:08] daigurren2: If you are a full bis priest, you dont have a way to easily sell your services @Xaryu
[1:37:09] darkwingduck06: If they can't catch flying bots how will they catch gdkp.
[1:37:09] chr47: L = " I can't buy BiS with gold anymore"
[1:37:09] professorslime: as someone who doesn’t like farming gold the GDKP is easy to join and get money for just completing raid and not bidding
[1:37:10] dukeskillz: its only an L for the people who run the GDKP and are able to quickly gear all their characters with endly host cut gold
[1:37:10] Landon_MDL: Its an L if you spend the whole phase 1 to grind 3k gold
[1:37:10] wookinit: L=gold buyers
[1:37:10] TheFernandeez: no he said its a W
[1:37:11] dhavinahsky: wwwww
[1:37:11] Lohvul: ofc he does
[1:37:11] Erbsosa: PHAT L
[1:37:11] Vichrinox: Asmongold did not say that
[1:37:11] gerakui: GDKP are always easy clearing pugs
[1:37:12] bigtimerush_1989: @socketslol GO PLAY RETAIL
[1:37:12] typer___iban: dumbass chatter lol
[1:37:12] ZonaGravy: asmon doesnt even play the game lmao
[1:37:12] budmodeos: he supports the process
[1:37:12] sircrumpler: Yeah asmon does there's a yt vid
[1:37:13] duckfarts_: dad with 4 kids and full time job
[1:37:13] PMA_1: inc 3 hour video
[1:37:13] UltiBook: It's like legalizing drugs - better to have some in game oversight than let everything happen in shady Discords @Xaryu
[1:37:13] AnyroadTwo: Asmons defense is laughable
[1:37:15] Drakothius: he's got a video
[1:37:15] Tybow0811: It's an easy way to get gold without investing a ton of time farming
[1:37:15] adam_brisbane: it is on his youtube I think
[1:37:16] elementixxx: I dont want to raid and only 1 item, why should I go raiding?
[1:37:16] Genghjs: Asmon loves P2W
[1:37:16] synos___: he has whole video on it on youtube
[1:37:18] Drakothius: on youtube
[1:37:18] detourz28: He doesn't play anymore lol
[1:37:18] KannedTuna: asmon has your same take, it would be great if it works but worth trying
[1:37:19] Visoth: GDKP isnt a problem if there wasnt gold buying/selling. @Xaryu
[1:37:19] Spikeqc: @Xaryu what does JaRule think about it?
[1:37:19] shiggydoo43: Asmongold jsut says its a player made system hes an idiot
[1:37:20] wanksterwow: GDKP incentivizes people who are geared/"done" to continue running the content @Xaryu
[1:37:20] KORMZ__: go play classic era there should be no gold buying in sod cant even get to 60 yet hahaha
[1:37:20] NobleStrat: he has a video
[1:37:20] Muttermundharmonika168: @Xaryu Its an L because its a farming method to GET gold... So if you want to have trihard consumables, I have more chars, to sign in for GDKPS
[1:37:21] brie_feusang: Asmongold always has terrible takes though KEKW
[1:37:21] Libertas09: I don't gdkp, but it's fine in itself it's only gold buyers/bots that matter. Ban them not ban gdkps
[1:37:21] FelipeLLs: because if u dont have a guild u just gonna run over and over with pugs and never get the item u want unless u get lucky @Xaryu
[1:37:22] K3tchup_33: No, Asmon thinks banning GDKP is an L but thinks trying it in SoD is a W
[1:37:22] sircrumpler: HE DID SAY IT
[1:37:22] jujujay_myalias: Let us play how we want to play. There's nothing fundamentally wrong with trading gold for items. It's integral to how the game works
[1:37:23] scorpinot: About Blizzard's Latest Decision. <youtube search for asmongold
[1:37:23] alexgoat94: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evp_UmpTpcM
[1:37:24] lolo40001: ASmond said today that he likes GDKP but he is viewiing this as a W
[1:37:24] peetca: Who cares about assmon opinion lol?;q
[1:37:25] chrislu18: asmon is also an asshole
[1:37:25] zeep_07: gold buyers keep the economy up
[1:37:25] ZeRoHOOTz_: i think the perma ban for doing it is kinda L @Xaryu
[1:37:25] captdangles420: The only thing that i could think this would be an L would be for casual players that dont have time to play the game but at the same time if u dont have time dont play
[1:37:26] EmJayKae: can you link the article
[1:37:26] grubols: I mean it’s asmon lol
[1:37:26] TheGoofyDragon: Only thing i liked about GDKP was how easy it became to afford a mount
[1:37:27] surrena: You do not have to join GDKP runs
[1:37:27] Farenheight451: Asmon doesnt even play wow
[1:37:28] FullySuited: 30minutes KEKW
[1:37:29] B_Rize: It’s an L because it won’t slow down RMT
[1:37:29] woofwoof2121: his argument is strictly based on Nostalgia
[1:37:30] TheFox0228: Asmon sees it as an L because nostalgia but he's okay with trying no GDKP
[1:37:31] Badbotqt: you can raid whenever with a gdkp, not a set guild schedule
[1:37:31] lastad94: wtch the section
[1:37:31] Saravyn: @Xaryu Asmon says GDKP is not the problem, the gold buying is. He said like perm the gold buyers and GDKP isn't an issue
[1:37:32] Richtblock: this is realy dump. you dont ban money to get rid of counterfeit money
[1:37:32] sircrumpler: Just watch 10 min or so
[1:37:32] Cant0n: Skip
[1:37:33] macjcool: no thanks
[1:37:33] alexgoat94: no
[1:37:33] FelipeLLs: because if u dont have a guild u just gonna run over and over with pugs and never get the item u want unless u get lucky @Xaryu !!
[1:37:34] kebablover55555: its l because theres no way they can track all gdkps and this rule will be abused to ban some specific people
[1:37:34] fetza108: the philosopher is back
[1:37:34] lolo40001: @Xaryu ASmond said today that he likes GDKP but he is viewiing this as a W
[1:37:34] Lohvul: pls no
[1:37:34] bennybe: i dont buy gold but i like being able to buy the shit i need from PvE to PVP which is what i wanna spend my time on.
[1:37:34] scorpinot: check his quote for 30:51
[1:37:34] ruperttheyeti: Asmon's 30 minute opinion zzzz
[1:37:34] lastad94: its one section
[1:37:35] zeep_07: time stamps?
[1:37:35] Drakothius: skip the story time
[1:37:35] detourz28: He said he disagrees but he appreciates their approach
[1:37:35] Libertas09: Only first 10min is relevant
[1:37:35] wmaKRET: watch the last part
[1:37:36] ninespoons: "why this is a horrible decision" start there
[1:37:36] Knocktoff: he benefits from them though, I would say there's bias
[1:37:36] iguessTTV: if you think this is an L you either buy gold are are someone who runs gdkps and scims off the top lol
[1:37:36] drummond777: WATCH IT
[1:37:37] fabulais: Go for it
[1:37:37] thatdogbitme: tldr plz
[1:37:37] larnsmarf: lol you thought asmon could release a 2min video??
[1:37:37] KORMZ__: watch it
[1:37:37] PMA_1: asmoning
[1:37:37] Mico027: Typical asmon stretching
[1:37:37] alexgoat94: go to timeline
[1:37:37] sircrumpler: He gives his opinion early
[1:37:37] espi: just go to the "why" sections
[1:37:38] Naxonus: just watch like 10 mins
[1:37:38] grubols: skip please
[1:37:39] fabulais: Let's watch it
[1:37:39] bennybe: i dont buy gold but i like being able to buy the shit i need from PvE to PVP which is what i wanna spend my time on..
[1:37:39] 00Absurd: 30 min farm lmao
[1:37:39] mr__mojo_: well where do they stop now? regulate the 1000+ gold BoEs on AH? what about stealth runs and boosts?
[1:37:40] patites_: I think its a W however i don't think it's fair people cannot buy gold but streamers can take it from viewers
[1:37:40] hagspretten: last 15 is yapping
[1:37:40] bigtimerush_1989: WATCH FIRST 10 MINUTES
[1:37:40] Guydx: Go to around 6 minutes
[1:37:40] hclark0: skip
[1:37:40] Zashooo: just watch 1 min
[1:37:41] tellmeagainiforgot: ofc asmon has to rant bro
[1:37:41] lolzandis: GO TO WHY THIS IS A HORRIBLE DECISION
[1:37:41] Geymear: @Xaryu watch the story
[1:37:42] brummE1337: @Xaryu are you surprised, he gets a 5min react clip to be 30min
[1:37:42] RageTry: im  in for watching haha
[1:37:43] idkmunky: 21:20
[1:37:43] ralphh1541: it's the 2 or 3rd section
[1:37:44] guld1337: @Xaryu the argument i hear is that youre forced into a guild now for loot, unless you want to keep losing roll to new players weekly. not everyone can fit that schedule with RL
[1:37:44] Prevara96: just watch the start
[1:37:44] Naxonus: dont need to watch entire video
[1:37:44] SirKalikan: skip all
[1:37:44] Ohaitherelol: I dont play GDKP's. But I think ppl should be able to do what they want. I hate the gold buying meta etc but it has been there since long before GDKP was a thing even and it WONT make that dissapear.
[1:37:45] dildyj: if there was a soulbound currency and a loot mode that auctions items after each boss that would be amazing. GDKP isn't the problem, the currency is
[1:37:45] bigtimerush_1989: YOU DONT NEED TO WATCH FUL VIDEO
[1:37:45] Spikeqc: watch at 2x speed
[1:37:45] bakedthief333: look only the downside of gdkp
[1:37:47] YezenZ: he posted a YouTube video
[1:37:47] zeep_07: @Xaryu click to the timestamps
[1:37:47] slebluue: @Xaryu I don't raid with guild. Like the ability to join a raid and earn items over time by getting a cut. Feels bad to constantly lose rolls in a pug
[1:37:47] CodeValor: He thinks Blizzard needs to tackle to the root of the problem which is the gold buyers, not the social construct of GDKPs which is how some people enjoy to raid.
[1:37:48] kirk_hunts: Watch beginning and end
[1:37:49] typer___iban: asmon enjoys his own experience in GDKPs, and wish they could control gold buying another way, but he thinks this is necessary with state of the game
[1:37:49] tonneswow: Watch first 10
[1:37:50] Smor7: watch at 1.5x speed
[1:37:51] IIezyII: This is a L for me as a GDKP player that doesnt buy gold. For sure...GDKP is the most fair loot system
[1:37:51] ashe00s: he doesn't care because he gets all the gold and items for doing nothing
[1:37:53] Spikeqc: watch at 2x speed @Xaryu  ppOverheat
[1:37:53] eddymm: is asmon bro, that dude farm reacts like no tomorrow
[1:37:53] sircrumpler: @xaryu there's 10-15 min before a story it's not as long
[1:37:54] ruperttheyeti: asmon is so full of himself
[1:37:54] NERD778: because you’re rewarded for your time even if you item didn’t drop and will have more gold for the next gdkp if you run with the same ppl it’s pretty much just dkp
[1:37:56] Seoken1: GDKP Carry people are kinda wrongly hurt even though they don’t buy gold @xaryu . I don’t care but I see their side
[1:37:57] catbalou2: Shobek will think its an L yesterday he was arguing GDKP good for game
[1:37:57] pandemanium_tv: even if gdkps are banned bots will still farm mats and raise prices on the AH so basic required items will be priced out for everyone, it's inevitable. maybe the bot measures will help
[1:37:58] sunny_lik: @bigtimerush_1989 I DONT have time to farm gold and my wife took my son away because i pushed him to farm gold for me.... sad story
[1:38:01] nimzlocker: Every loot system has its advantages and disadvantages
[1:38:02] macjcool: L hair
[1:38:03] lylo_tv: OMEGALUL xaryu like "mmm actually nahh"
[1:38:07] bigwilly3737: banning gdkp and not boosting is insane
[1:38:08] Karpaa: will be dc channels where it happens without ingame communigation
[1:38:08] crappiefisher7: I dont GDKP, but dont have time to farm gold for consumes for raid
[1:38:10] Puffypuffs: Hmm
[1:38:10] Pixiepantss: NODDERS
[1:38:10] YezenZ: Watch it
[1:38:11] aeropresso: A friend and I started a GDKP server in SoD. We do not engage in RMT. We built a community of 200+ players. We did end up playing with people who were obvs gold buying, but it was a way where we could schedule multiple runs per lockout and make gold doing so. Lotta work, but met a lot of great people we now play with on the reg. Not mad about blizz's decision btw. Just my exp.
[1:38:13] berserage95: WHY ARE we listenting to someone who doesnt evne play wow
[1:38:14] Dochunk: @Xaryu You're a dad. Luckily this is your job, but for most of us it isn't. Working our job for one hour is much  more cost effective than farming gold for one hour.
[1:38:15] SoCal_Badfish: they asked his to defend it
[1:38:16] ZonaGravy: BASED asmon takes, per usual
[1:38:16] larnsmarf: then put them on their own server
[1:38:22] macjcool: dude doesnt even play wow anymore LMAO
[1:38:23] lylo_tv: @berserage95 BASED
[1:38:23] squarepusher_: The ninja that is given thousands of gold in classic has an issue with banning GDKP, who would have thought
[1:38:23] Cant0n: Bedge
[1:38:25] murphyb913: asmon is being a contrarian on this issue to bait the potential drama videos he can profit from
[1:38:26] Spikeqc: Hmm
[1:38:26] Exusprime: the waffle
[1:38:26] myfellowpurgers2: doesnt break tos but ruins the game
[1:38:29] Nicholas909: same
[1:38:30] skootyskooty: Can take the time to collect gold over the runs, if you dont want to join them, then keep doing scuffed MS>OS runs
[1:38:32] scorpinot: From 1312s "GDKP'S we're my favorite part of the week" lel
[1:38:33] chadworld77: YOURE MISSING CONTEXT
[1:38:34] polesreport: defense is nostalgia?
[1:38:35] Thabab040: he rly loves to sound smart
[1:38:37] Saravyn: LET HIM COOK
[1:38:37] pinkos4thestate: Precisely
[1:38:38] wookinit: yep
[1:38:38] thatdogbitme: yeah, exploiters and buyers, sounds like fun
[1:38:38] typer___iban: KEKW
[1:38:39] Spikeqc: Hmm Hmm Hmm Hmm Hmm
[1:38:39] chadworld77: HE SAID HE LIKES THAT THEY ARE EXPERIMENTING
[1:38:39] bigwilly3737: gdkps are great
[1:38:40] vision42g: @macjcool he literally has bis gear in sod
[1:38:40] Naxonus: They absolutely have
[1:38:40] Reaperz_kinetic: I WONDER WHY KEKW cause bro gets fed gold by viewers
[1:38:41] AnyroadTwo: Asmon should be a politician. He’s got the bs speech down
[1:38:44] grubols: guys remember people who win debates often are the ones wrong, just cuz you can you debate tactics like asmon doesn’t mean you know shit
[1:38:44] sosa_4: asmon didng po
[1:38:46] B_Rize: LET HIM COOK
[1:38:46] grebby71: as a streamer whose fans give gold, of course he did
[1:38:47] wookinit: out of date
[1:38:47] berserage95: asmon is unbearable he starts with a 20 year example
[1:38:48] bralter: isnt gold buying against tos so having gold buyers as a part is a round about against tos
[1:38:52] sosa_4: asmon didng play wow
[1:38:53] sircrumpler: Also gdkp in 2008 is way different than now
[1:38:54] darkh0rst: ofc he liked it, getting gold blasted up his ass all day
[1:38:57] rhaziaa: Also Asmon's experience is completely different than 99% of other players because he can just farm gold from his viewers
[1:38:59] B_Rize: EXACTLY
[1:39:00] DynamerX: @Xaryu imagine i wasfarming 12 hours a day, just to know that whenepic staff drops i canbid as muchas i can, i cant imagine so random alt with green items will win roll against me, thats why it is an L, because now people can go online once per 3 days and win rll against me, while iam playing every day and enjooying every piece of content
[1:39:02] pinkos4thestate: But you only find them in gdkps
[1:39:03] Boats_NW: he doesnt hav to buy gold though people just spam him with in game donos
[1:39:03] Zerksyera: you can make massive amounts of gold as a farmer who doesnt do GDKP
[1:39:08] pinkos4thestate: More than anything
[1:39:09] bazzzzzzz: CORRECT.
[1:39:09] Cant0n: bro doesnt see laissez faire GDKP fucks up the game
[1:39:10] ZonaGravy: facts
[1:39:10] fetza108: yes
[1:39:11] Tymburlol: Chad Xar Take
[1:39:11] brummE1337: yeah stupid arguement
[1:39:11] vision42g: he has bis gear in sod chat stfu
[1:39:12] macjcool: 100%
[1:39:12] polesreport: yes
[1:39:14] FullySuited: 100%
[1:39:15] hayvex: truth
[1:39:15] SamAkaforty: 100%
[1:39:16] Mico027: GDKP is the MAIN source of gold buying
[1:39:16] Woah_Zerk: 100%
[1:39:16] CHICKENARMSANDLEGS: yes
[1:39:17] ruperttheyeti: YEP

[1:39:18] Vichrinox: let the video cook
[1:39:18] Saravyn: 100% correct take Xar
[1:39:18] s4ndoro: the putting a token soon xD lol
[1:39:19] B_Rize: False
[1:39:19] RockyMountainOyster: GDKPs is the single biggest reason to buy gold
[1:39:20] rhaziaa: Which in turn drives bots
[1:39:20] gorthymog: 100% correct'
[1:39:20] davisjones_: Imagine justifying GDPK by saying they'd do it nonetheless
[1:39:20] mabbitt7: yes
[1:39:20] sunkys1: have we watched uberdanger today yet?
[1:39:20] Darksyde1029: 100% true
[1:39:21] Slyxen: gdkp and boosting both promote it
[1:39:21] Prevara96: @Xaryu he agees with this
[1:39:21] sinshockbreak: yup
[1:39:26] hayvex: and inherently destroys the economy
[1:39:26] WhySoSerious04: askon logs on and gets 1000 gold from all his viewers lol.
[1:39:29] berserage95: im so glad asmon is here to give his opinion on a topic so i can copy his opinion as my own
[1:39:29] king___slender: the take that buying gold levels the playing field is such a stupid ass take
[1:39:29] Chazmaglazz: cheaters
[1:39:30] Quabbe: same is true to the auction house
[1:39:31] professorslime: people who are going to buy gold are going to buy it anyways tho lol
[1:39:32] antmd15: This makes inflation worse unless they tackle bot problem 100%
[1:39:32] DynamerX: @Xaryu imagine i wasfarming 12 hours a day, just to know that whenepic staff drops i canbid as muchas i can, i cant imagine so random alt with green items will win roll against me, thats why it is an L, because now people can go online once per 3 days and win rll against me, while iam playing every day and enjooying every piece of content
[1:39:32] ralphyyx3: yep boosting as well
[1:39:33] chr47: boosting too

[1:39:38] TheMysticBean: GDKPS are the main source of income for blizzard on wrath servers LUL
[1:39:39] boph4: Do buyers just stop buying gold because GDKP is gone?
[1:39:40] puladingg: Thats not Asmon... Thats Ai video of Asmon! LUL
[1:39:41] Chazmaglazz: cheaters gonna cheat
[1:39:41] genmd: Xar on his debate arc. i'm here for t
[1:39:43] squarepusher_: GDKP facilitates gold buying.
[1:39:44] Pixiepantss: NODDERS 󠀀
[1:39:46] logsnar: it's what causes all the BS inflation too, people starting bids at 50K on wrath trinkets when that game is dying
[1:39:48] Visoth: Blizzard should ban goldbuying/selling rather than GDKP
[1:39:49] Cant0n: theres a ton of toxic and bad emergent player behavior LUL
[1:39:52] asloff: HC*
[1:39:52] Spikeqc: ASM 5Head N
[1:39:52] thatdogbitme: gdkp's are an avenue for gold buyeras to spend, its one more route for them to spend botted gold on and help ruin a server economy
[1:39:55] Celbee: @Mico027 Not wanting to farm is the main source
[1:39:55] bigwilly3737: buyers dont stop buying gold bc gdkp is gone lol so slow
[1:40:00] king___slender: @Visoth both can  be done at the same time
[1:40:03] Johnvanhinten: GOLDBUYERS
[1:40:03] evildufus: It makes wow pay to gear but wow imo is still a skill game, there is no pay to win

[1:40:14] 00Absurd: true
[1:40:14] B_Rize: BASED
[1:40:15] Deatharmor98: @bigwilly3737 But more people buy gold when there are GDKPs
[1:40:16] swolygh0st: FACTUAL AND TRUE
[1:40:16] Nicholas909: facts
[1:40:17] macjcool: LMAO
[1:40:17] breezegodd: @Xaryu BANNING GDKP IS BLIZZ BEING LAZY BECAUSE THEY WONT JUST BAN AT THE SOURCE OF CHEATERS. THIS IS AT THE COST OF CASUAL LEGIT PLAYERS
[1:40:18] polesreport: its not like they have an alternative way to get gear lol
[1:40:18] berserage95: asmon playing devils advocate for something he has no interest or part LUL name a more iconic duo
[1:40:18] brummE1337: NOPE you are wrong dude
[1:40:19] sircrumpler: @dynamerx ok but what if that's that person's second or third character and they too play 12 hours and love the game? You're putting your own experience higher then another's when you don't necessarily know if that person is or isn't playing just as hard. But maybe on a new char
[1:40:19] Pixiepantss: NODDERS
[1:40:20] B_Rize: True and real
[1:40:21] ZonaGravy: also very true

[1:40:22] Alaska_87: they are legitimate.....but they base their existence on gold buyers tbh
[1:40:22] Pixiepantss: NODDERS
[1:40:24] mr__mojo_: facts
[1:40:24] blazzedzz: Yeh but they take dirty money lol
[1:40:24] mdamazing22: but they can ban all the GDKP players
[1:40:25] detourz28: His point is valid but also naive
[1:40:26] TMMOOF: They're doing both
[1:40:26] ruperttheyeti: hes stretching
[1:40:26] Oreo_Swagwagon: It's only in SOD, Asmon doesnt play SOD. Poor take
[1:40:28] Lightshadow86: they are recieveing stolen goods.
[1:40:28] king___slender: Lazy?
[1:40:28] donnieg93: listen up bots
[1:40:28] eric2307: Its an L to me. I dont got the commitment to join a guild and a gdkp ensures me of a raid with ppl who know what they do and got buffs/consumes. I like to parse and with a random pugs its not doable. Gdkp's do. It feels bad to 'lose' a good system to the goldbuying system.
[1:40:28] 7Berzerk: they cant beat botters... only way to beat them is to ban gdkps.
[1:40:29] Hellacat: blizzard intentionally doesnt ban gold buyers.
[1:40:31] bazzzzzzz: such a merh take
[1:40:31] Deatharmor98: @breezegodd Wrong
[1:40:32] TrooperHuge: yeah his point is to punish the gold sellers... but the gdkp are a after effect.
[1:40:35] polesreport: disagree that theyre being "punished"
[1:40:36] Torcher4K: If you receive gold in the mail you get flagged to not be allowed to do GDKP; easy clap
[1:40:37] wookinit: those people also sell gold to guildies who work LUL its still a shit system
[1:40:38] myfellowpurgers2: Just because its in the tos doesnt mean it's not ruining the game. it actively encourages people to buy gold which DOES break tos
[1:40:39] IronCatastrophe: "Fix" gold buying don't 'Fix' GDKP.  I agree with Az.
[1:40:39] squarepusher_: Asmon dumps thousands of dollars into gacha games. Ofcourse he's pro GDKP.
[1:40:40] king___slender: they just said they have new tech
[1:40:40] B_Rize: He’s spitting facts
[1:40:40] Mico027: @Mico027 my bad I badly worded it, I mean the mean spending source then its boosting, buying boe and consumes
[1:40:41] espi: calling devs lazy, typical
[1:40:41] rebel_fire_t: helping launder bought gold is innocent
[1:40:41] socketslol: @xaryu Its a pretty big L as much as I don't necessarily like the gold buying but the system is respected because its more fair than most LC teams and the RNG of /roll! You probably would've rolled against 12 players and probably lost anyways or a Loot Council wouldve just given it to someone else @Xaryu - Those gold buyers dont exist that much - I have 2000 ppl in my discord server as GDKP host in WotLK and I have like 3-5 whales -
[1:40:42] bigwilly3737: @Deatharmor98 they will just buy gold somewhere else if gdkp isnt there lol thats a shit take
[1:40:43] vision42g: ppl gonna quit 100%
[1:40:44] pinkos4thestate: In the end there is no gdkper out there that isn't relying on gold buyers to make them relevant
[1:40:44] Reaperz_kinetic: @Visoth gold buying is already banned...... its just not easy to always detect it because blizzard is playing defense
[1:40:45] bralter: those same people who raid in gdkp can still play in pugs that arent gdkp so they arent being punished
[1:40:47] Phubbs: lazy because they are taking action, hmm
[1:40:47] iPlayCuzFun: im legit and i wont miss GDKP
[1:40:47] berserage95: asmon doesnt and never will play sod why is his take so valued bro i cant
[1:40:48] catbalou2: Asmon has a chat full of spergs that hang on his every word!!
[1:40:49] SarcasticApe: NODDERS nerf hunters
[1:40:49] Pixiepantss: NODDERS 󠀀
[1:40:50] BadgerInTheMist: PEOPLE THAT DONT BUY GOLD DONT RUN GDKPS
[1:40:51] Nungiven: Guilty by association
[1:40:52] notMuklukian: This is treating the symptom and not the disease, I hope it works!
[1:40:52] Spikeqc: NODDERS
[1:40:53] pilot_wk: they could be more on top of botting, but because they refuse to take the steps to, players are being punished
[1:40:54] BadgerInTheMist: THEY CANT AFFORD IT
[1:40:56] morticianbuera: can they ban sodapopin? and it is good example to all??
[1:40:57] Deomas11: They're already punished with massive inflation.
[1:40:58] AnyroadTwo: They’re not innocent. You can’t do GDKP and not be stained with RMT gold.
[1:41:01] Alaska_87: it's their favourite cos they make tons of money because people buy gold
[1:41:01] Reaperz_kinetic: im sorry but if GDKPs are your favorite part of the game then somethings wrong lol
[1:41:01] BiGUnC__: why would gdkp be your favorite part of the game 🫠
[1:41:01] swolygh0st: < punished non gold-buying gdkp enjoyer FeelsBadMan
[1:41:02] iPlayCuzFun: if we didnt take part of GDKP we wont miss them either
[1:41:04] trmonx: there are no innocent GDKPs they all want buyers who spend lots
[1:41:07] Ohaitherelol: ppl always gonna buy gold and always have been.
[1:41:08] IIezyII: When i only need like 1 piece from a raid its much better to gdkp so at least you get something
[1:41:08] TheEndIsNear777: if gdkp is your favorite part of game you need to change your priorities because money isnt everything :p
[1:41:08] drummond777: why would they ban bots when bots need a wow subscription?
[1:41:08] chadworld77: AHH XARYU please watch the part where he says he likes they are experimenting (i'm from the future)
[1:41:09] Darksyde1029: @boph4 A lot would yes. You don't really need that much gold if you're not spending hundreds or thousands outbidding other players for gear. Mount cost, weekly consumables for raid, respecs and repairs are pretty much all the main gold sinks and they don't hold a candle to how much gold you can spend in a GDKP. Without GDKPs many people will have literally no reason to buy gold.
[1:41:09] teammatteus: "innocent"
[1:41:11] mr__mojo_: people think this will really make a difference when BoEs will still be going for unethical amounts of gold
[1:41:12] DynamerX: @sircrumpler even that, alt character cant have same chances as me on my main waiting for my epic item, just no
[1:41:13] Spikeqc: HACKERMANS IM IN
[1:41:13] zeitungsleser30: blizzard lets bot farm gold for months without banning them. that makes it even worse
[1:41:14] brummE1337: Thats just not how the world works. You cant do that in reality :D Thats just being ignorant of how things turns out. Sure some is fine, but the majority in this community IS NOT today in 2024
[1:41:15] dildyj: You have like 4 teams but okay hahaha
[1:41:18] bralter: they can still raid just cant make thousands of gold from it so not really being punished
[1:41:19] Deomas11: Nobody is innocent, everyone in a GDKP makes gold because of buyers.
[1:41:23] jojoshambho: You can afford being in gdkps if u run them for a bit, u get a decent amount from the splits. I am happy gdkp is gone tho
[1:41:26] DynamerX: @Xaryu imagine i wasfarming 12 hours a day, just to know that whenepic staff drops i canbid as muchas i can, i cant imagine so random alt with green items will win roll against me, thats why it is an L, because now people can go online once per 3 days and win rll against me, while iam playing every day and enjooying every piece of content
[1:41:27] AnyroadTwo: Well You as in participants of GDKP.
[1:41:27] Weddzz: I think Blizzard could ban people way faster than they do right now. I get the feeling they consciously delay the ban to make it enough profitable for them to continue to buy new accounts - that is a win for Blizzard.
[1:41:27] fanniclap: Wow community is so funny to me rofl
[1:41:29] siggysudzz: true doing a cybersecurity project now
[1:41:35] FezzikGG: @Xaryu the problem is the most recent issue with punishing gold buyers is just taking away Soda's gold instead of a perma. That ruins the credibility
[1:41:35] hooden: I run gdkp to get gold, not to spend xD I rather do a few gdkp runs then kill murlocs for 40 hours
[1:41:47] wanksterwow: @Xaryu I've spent probably over a thousand dollars on gold since classic and not even a warning. Hard time believing theyre trying
[1:41:48] s4ndoro: what did blizzard say again? they banning gdkp>
[1:41:50] IIezyII: People who dont like GDKP are most likely bad players be real
[1:41:50] Exusprime: Over the many years Asmon rarely sees things from others perspective, separate to his experience
[1:41:51] I_TARKEL_I: its a circle of gold buying gdkp group leaders sell gold too
[1:41:51] evildufus: Banning bots is so much easier said than done
[1:41:51] Hellacat: @Xaryu people buy gold for YEARS, time after time, its not cybersecurity. its lax punishments. Soda got items removed, not even a ban. That taught everyone blizzard DOES NOT ban gold buyers.
[1:41:52] huckleson: @hooden same, im prob gonna buy gold now unironically kekw
[1:41:53] shadowthehedgehog97: very nice point
[1:41:53] Trav_Where: I legitimately have not seen a single gdkp in sod so I'm not sure how much they will learn from this test
[1:41:53] Blkmrkt1: @Deomas11 everyone selling stuff makes gold because of buyers KEKL
[1:41:53] berserage95: i wonder if asmon gets tired of pretending to care about every topic he has to talk about
[1:41:57] chr47: @hooden yeah just outsource the gold farming to the robots :)
[1:41:58] Valsu: why cant you just have GMs that do /who stockades
[1:42:00] Reaperz_kinetic: @hooden and by doing that youre indirectly supporting gold buyers and sellers... simple as that
[1:42:06] TheFamilyAffair: @hooden but you're taking gold from goldbuyers, which basically supports the problem.
[1:42:07] Akompliss: Hell yeah, a rare W for Blizzard. Frick GDKPs
[1:42:09] Johnvanhinten: u can play SoftRes-Runs like not goldbuying ppl btw... @Xaryu
[1:42:10] vision42g: stop tryin why tho man everyone happy let them enjoy the game
[1:42:10] Ervill1: this still won't 100% solve it
[1:42:11] ruperttheyeti: banning GDKP will 100% reduce the hell out of it, watch the gold price drop for proof
[1:42:12] huckleson: I liked doing gdkp to make gold. Im prob gonna unironically buy gold because of this change LOL
[1:42:12] espi: @Valsu lol
[1:42:13] Genghjs: Bring back GMs
[1:42:13] wookinit: the new tech from private pvp servers will stop all this bs
[1:42:13] thatdogbitme: @brummE1337 Asmon is being willfully ignorant with this take, gdkp's are not what he's describing at all anymore
[1:42:14] Weddzz: They delay it purposely so that it's enough profitable for botters to continue to buy new accounts.
[1:42:18] sircrumpler: The only arguments I'm seeing for wanting gdkp are self centered and "I want the gear NOW"
[1:42:25] brummE1337: @thatdogbitme exactlly
[1:42:26] DynamerX: @Xaryu imagine i wasfarming 12 hours a day, just to know that whenepic staff drops i canbid as muchas i can, i cant imagine so random alt with green items will win roll against me, thats why it is an L, because now people can go online once per 3 days and win rll against me, while iam playing every day and enjooying every piece of content
[1:42:27] Tydus_HW: ive never taken part of an GDKP but im sure i've been negatively affected in some way, be it inflated market or bots

[1:42:40] Pixiepantss: NODDERS 󠀀
[1:42:40] mr__mojo_: instead of milking gold buyers with gdkp now, you can just do it with consumes, boosts and AH items…
[1:42:41] berserage95: asmon fell off when his hair grew more than 1cm on his head fr ego and
[1:42:42] Destro82: BLIZZARD IS MAKING  LOTS OF MONEY FROM ALL THOSE  bot accounts why would they ban them ?
[1:42:42] FlowersAnger: It's not even gold buying that was their reasoning. It's the way it affects the community, as they stated in the blue post ...
[1:42:48] boph4: @Darksyde1029 But, it was happening before GDKP and will continue after. Its been a core problem in wow since retail classic.
[1:42:49] king___slender: buying loot is so stupid
[1:42:49] Valsu: a literal 16 year old can ban half the bots with /who
[1:42:50] loris18794: @xaryu what if they dont allow to trade more than 10g per day
[1:42:51] bigwilly3737: @sircrumpler you can just have a bot run you thru a boost for gear you dont have to do a gdkp lol
[1:42:53] graziNNN: GDKPs are great (In wotlk), I understand banning it in SoD
[1:42:53] paz_lmao: W take - in the essence of itself nothing wrong with GDKP but its been bastardized
[1:42:56] d_droplet: if they make money soulbound and trading items make the items soulbound that could probably work
[1:42:56] brie_feusang: By his definition isn't buying gold "emergent gameplay" too?  The devs didn't intend it
[1:42:57] B_Rize: BLIZZARD DOESNT EVEN BAN BOTS LOL

[1:42:59] huckleson: I did gdkp to make gold but Im prob just gonna buy it now after this change. Cba to farm hours for SoD gold sorry
[1:43:00] Dash4cash723: People can still announce GDKps in discord and keep doing them no?
[1:43:01] espi: @Destro82 no, they are not. Bot farms dont pay subscriptions lol

[1:43:03] Phubbs: im not being punished
[1:43:03] simonn992: With this argument, Remove Gold completely then? You can still buy BiS BoE?

[1:43:05] grubols: entire”

[1:43:05] sekuron: 80% of wow players are casuals...casuals cant make gold by pugging in GDKPS on 5 diffferent chars so they are "forced" to buy gold to get gear..."but they can do their own raids" no they cant because they are casuals...
[1:43:05] shadowthehedgehog97: is not being able to run a gdkp a "punishment"?

[1:43:46] king___slender: wow token sucks too

[1:43:51] Darksyde1029: @boph4 No one is saying it will stop all gold buying. But listen to what Xar is saying, it removes a major INCENTIVE for gold buying. Without GDKP many people who might have bought gold in order to buy gear will instead decide not to, therefore reducing the demand for gold which hurts gold sellers and botters.
[1:43:52] trmonx: no gdkp worse? asmon is out of touch
[1:43:55] s4ndoro: super weird
[1:43:56] logsnar: i bought wow tokens in wrath becuase I was struggling to keep up with the inflation of illegal gold buying to gear my characters....and i hated it

[1:44:07] fiftyfiftyyes: We baning bots also but after 4 5 months (we need the subs) KappaRoss KappaRoss KappaRoss  GDKP is same thing
[1:44:09] TrooperHuge: talking in ablsouts... the WHOLE ENTRY GAME is ruined from Gdkp? sorry no.
[1:44:09] graziNNN: Why is weird that Blizz wants to make more $$$? They are a business
[1:44:10] goldenteething: yeah but streamers get gold given to them by viewers all the time too
[1:44:10] brummE1337: @Xaryu NO thats not weird. THey could not beat the botters, and wanted a piece of the cake ofc :D its a company
[1:44:16] bigwilly3737: this is an L bc blizzard has a wow token that they sell themselves but wanna ban gold buying? lol what a joke of a company
[1:44:17] loris18794: @xaryu what if they dont allow to trade more than 10g per day
[1:44:17] Howells_tv: I think he is just making arguments for both sides
[1:44:18] WenisPiener: asmongold is salty bc he cant use the gold viewers funnel to him
[1:44:19] morticianbuera: cant stand asmongold

[1:44:22] thatdogbitme: unless you have some sort of steak in non legit gold buyers....
[1:44:22] Slyxen: because the WOW token costs more LUL
[1:44:22] Farenheight451: hes so sure they are doing nothing about bots. They are doing something about bots
[1:44:23] macjcool: too lazy LMAO
[1:44:24] morticianbuera: asmongold sucks
[1:44:24] Richtblock: true
[1:44:24] brummE1337: also, NO games can win vs botters today, they will always be ahead
[1:44:24] Pixiepantss: NODDERS 󠀀
[1:44:25] espi: man is an idiot
[1:44:25] fanniclap: "asmons wrong cause i disagree with thim " rofl this is half of chats stance. braindead
[1:44:26] Pixiepantss: NODDERS
[1:44:26] Valsu: they ARE
[1:44:26] AbsoluteDespair: This is probably one of his worst takes
[1:44:26] polesreport: thats all conjecture
[1:44:28] BKDDY: when hes being frost bolted xarPain
[1:44:28] enigmasvea: @Xaryu youre forgetting the server lag STV event will cause KEKW
[1:44:28] catbalou2: Asmo...ME ME ME ME
[1:44:29] Reaperz_kinetic: asmon is just such an L take jesus
[1:44:33] sneakyPizzA: they're making money of bots subs too, just the token is a better rate
[1:44:33] polesreport: talking out of his ass
[1:44:34] Johnvanhinten: yeah p2w is fun support it
[1:44:34] Spikeqc: blizzard lazy tho fr NODDERS
[1:44:36] drinkingcoldbeer: they are not doing enough
[1:44:37] nikola420tesla: Asmon is right.  Blizzrad profits off botting period.
[1:44:38] HugzGG: @Reaperz_kinetic what is L about it tho
[1:44:38] Destro82: but what ever when has blizzard ever listened to twitch lol
[1:44:38] nakht__: I donn't think you are
[1:44:40] B_Rize: Blizzard is god awful lazy lol
[1:44:40] wookinit: you cant be pro gdkps and anti wow token LUL
[1:44:40] handovdoom666: people get banned and just start a new account
[1:44:42] kkzam: EVERY mmo has failed in stopping botts
[1:44:42] king___slender: why do we act like Asmon knows anything?
[1:44:43] espi: asmon L take
[1:44:44] Hellacat: BLIZZARD BANS BOTS, BLIZZARD DOES NOT BAN GOLD BUYERS.
[1:44:46] jacksunson: lazy... bro talks like a conservative politician
[1:44:46] drummond777: they arent lazy about it they just dont do it because bots = $$
[1:44:47] fetza108: gdkp is bad thats all
[1:44:48] aeropresso: @Xaryu A friend and I started a GDKP server in SoD. We do not engage in RMT. We built a community of 200+ players. We did end up playing with some people who were obvs gold buying. GDKP structure was a good way to walk a way from every raid with something even if your loot didn't drop or someone else out purchased you. It was a lot of work, but we met a lot of great people we now play with on the reg. Not against blizz's decision btw. Just wanted to share my exp.
[1:44:50] JackLarsen4: trade logs
[1:44:50] detourz28: His point is a bit invalid there. He is being naive
[1:44:50] macjcool: Big L Take
[1:44:50] Valsu: blizzard is incompetent at banning, any 16 year old can do it
[1:44:51] amadeusthespirit: Gold buying to buying token is waste too, waste money on gold to buy more wow token to get more WoW time.
[1:44:51] squarepusher_: Asmon pretends like he's the "everyman" while at the same time has been given everything in game.
[1:44:52] taylorsdank: Yeah his perspective is limited on the matter.
[1:44:52] fiftyfiftyyes: blizz are not lazy they are making profit out of it
[1:44:52] B_Rize: yes you can
[1:44:54] Pixiepantss: Essaying holy
[1:44:56] Narmakh: blizzard hate = views
[1:44:59] evildufus: But blizz is trying to band them, I've known a bunch of peeps who have been punished for gold buying in sod
[1:44:59] Spikeqc: Essaying
[1:45:00] berserage95: asmon got carried to glad in retail wow, he gets boosted but has no problem with it if its him
[1:45:01] luravi: Yes you are gullible about this xaryu
[1:45:01] Curtsy: It is literall yimpossible to get rid of 100% of rmt, not a single mmorpg has ever done it in 20 years
[1:45:02] Destro82: blizzard doest give a fuck what people on twitch want lol
[1:45:02] handy_grenade: BAN GOLD
[1:45:02] bigwilly3737: they sell a wow token but wanna ban gold buyers? lmao blizzard is a joke
[1:45:03] drinkingcoldbeer: it cost less to do it this way.. they are not doing enough on the front end
[1:45:03] Puffypuffs: i'll sit in front a monitor all day banning people by a few hundred a month, hit me up blizzard EZ
[1:45:04] Valsu: private servers policed it
[1:45:06] Xeliumimar: I'm sorry guys I admit, I am a buyer of gold
[1:45:07] swolygh0st: BOTS = PAYING SUBSCRIBERS KEKW
[1:45:08] mdamazing22: attack the game
[1:45:08] FullySuited: I think asmon's ego has gotten too big. He says these things like they are facts
[1:45:08] Naxonus: Yeah. PirateSoftware has great videos on why you will never get rid of botters
[1:45:08] Mico027: Get rid of the main use of gold
[1:45:10] chr47: @Xaryu you are 100% correct, but asmon likes to say populist stuff
[1:45:11] logsnar: I think he has a jaded perspective because he already resents the hell out of blizzard
[1:45:11] key_5: delusional take from asmongold
[1:45:12] rocknsake: yeah, they will 100% never be able to ban all the bots and gold buyers, will just never happen
[1:45:13] brie_feusang: Doesn't that logic that "people will find a way" apply to GDKPs as well?
[1:45:13] Exusprime: yea but Asmon has been on the internet for years KEKW  /s
[1:45:14] Reaperz_kinetic: @HugzGG that he has no idea what hes talking about LOL.... hes basing his argument on the premise that finding gold sellers and buyers is extremely easy and its not easy at all
[1:45:14] mr__mojo_: then why do anything is the point? bandaid over a bullet wound type fix
[1:45:16] boph4: You are wrong when you think they can identify it through trades guys, they would ban gold buyers the moment their receive their gold if this was the case. Its got to be something to do with application files.
[1:45:17] king___slender: He's just a guy in his basement that got famous for wow videos. He dont know shit
[1:45:17] jmason47: No, he's purposefully being ignorant. Work in software engineering and you're right on your take. It's a constant reactive cycle that will never end.
[1:45:25] TheNJV: I used to raid with someone who legit made more money selling gold than an actual job in his country.
[1:45:25] Sterlinekinetic: moooo
[1:45:25] macjcool: I wonder if banning GDKP will make it so teh cost of the economy items goes up
[1:45:25] jackpepsimba: GDKP players- if you dont want to roll on loot go play a single player game. BG3 is pretty good! Bye!
[1:45:26] iPlayCuzFun: flankin the problem
[1:45:27] pilot_wk: you can SIGNIFICANTLY reduce botting by employing people to monitor it IN GAME
[1:45:28] Hellacat: BLIZZARD DOES NOT BAN GOLD BUYERS. look at Soda and onlyfangs - items removed, lol. some players MIGHT see a 2 week ban.
[1:45:29] nachidru: lower the incentives to have tons of gold
[1:45:30] Ervill1: you could also ban auction house to make gold buying even less appealing :)
[1:45:30] B_Rize: private servers literally did it with 5 devs LOL but Blizzard can’t
[1:45:31] crobeamer: BAN Their Device ID LUL
[1:45:31] syukaan1: peepoTalk
[1:45:31] AnyroadTwo: i wen to school for cyber security. it’s a losing battle but you can take charge by 1) making it too hard to do 2) lowering the demand to do it.
[1:45:31] thatdogbitme: @nikola420tesla that's not what he's saying, he's saying there's no point to banning a known gold buying tool simply because it's not the end all solution
[1:45:32] Barleycorned: See thats your problem Xar - you have en education thats relevant, asmon and most of chat doesnt
[1:45:33] fabulais: @king___slender So salty lmao
[1:45:35] Dash4cash723: He is talking about ban bots not people that buy gold
[1:45:37] Arisnadia: gamers don't know shit about cybersecurity yet they love to bash devs for it
[1:45:39] Johnvanhinten: that asmon smock nowadays he is a big sellout, years before he will never support p2w. money controlled asmonbich
[1:45:41] Woah_Zerk: Instead of being only on defense with removing bots, they went offensive as well and de-incentivized gold buying in a tangible way. W
[1:45:43] Nungiven: Asmon does not fully understand the issue
[1:45:45] eddymm: he is too focus on just put this on blizzard fault imo.. is not a valid point to defend GDKPS
[1:45:46] fanniclap: @king___slender You sound super bitter LOLOL
[1:45:47] Spikeqc: cook em asmon NODDERS
[1:45:47] bazzzzzzz: jesus
[1:45:48] ruperttheyeti: over react
[1:45:48] Pixiepantss: NODDERS
[1:45:49] kkzam: hes so whiny
[1:45:50] Reaperz_kinetic: @fabulais salty but hes right
[1:45:50] polesreport: madge
[1:45:51] TheMysticBean: @TheNJV A lot of iranians on retail do that
[1:45:51] AbsoluteDespair: He does not play this game anyways
[1:45:52] joonelius3: GDKP ban wil ruin raiding. people will start to sell raid spots, hard reserves, gatekeeping will get out of hand. People who grinded gold this phase grinded for nothing. the toxic loudmouths got their will through and this will be bad.
[1:45:54] kkzam: HE IS SO WHINY
[1:45:55] JackLarsen4: trueeeee
[1:45:55] bwillyboy: Asmon just guessing lol
[1:45:55] berserage95: asmon playing devils advocate on a topic he has no clue on LUL just another asmon stream LUL
[1:45:55] voltrox1909: BAIT
[1:45:58] sneakyPizzA: they cut all their CS so banning GKDP is just less labour intensive than anything else
[1:45:58] ruperttheyeti: Asmon: BabyRage I WANT GDKP
[1:45:58] Reaperz_kinetic: THATS NOT TRUE AT ALL HES SO IGNORANT
[1:45:59] espi: he's so dumb
[1:45:59] brummE1337: This is the weirdest argument ive ever heard, holy F he is shit !
[1:45:59] grumpyGGoose: personal loot also solves the problem
[1:46:00] ArcheRazor_: gdkp is still going to exist - it will just be pure rmt run directly through discord with no gold involved
[1:46:00] Tydus_HW: hes based it on an assumption
[1:46:00] Wavy_Sinatra: LMFAO 󠀀
[1:46:00] Nonprophetx: his viewers give him tons of gold and he wants to use it to buy items on stream
[1:46:00] lumi929: L take
[1:46:00] macjcool: L
[1:46:00] Zerksyera: HE  IS RIGHT

[1:46:01] morticianbuera: ASMONGOLD SUCKS
[1:46:02] handovdoom666: he's an idiot
[1:46:02] TB8008: He doesn't play the game anymore?
[1:46:03] Oreo_Swagwagon: L
[1:46:04] B_Rize: TRUE AND REAL
[1:46:04] Spikeqc: Essaying
[1:46:04] jacksunson: hes a politician. full of shhhh
[1:46:04] Pixiepantss: asmon is hilarious
[1:46:05] peetca: This guy is an idiot can you turn him off?
[1:46:06] jackpepsimba: Asmon has been going downhill for like a year now. Poor boy is sundowning
[1:46:06] evildufus: Smh
[1:46:06] HelluvaWrecks: hes thick as shit
[1:46:06] jiggyspice: hes just hyping up the hate bandwagon for content tbh LUL
[1:46:07] B_Rize: W TAKE
[1:46:07] murphyb913: hes baiting drama videos
[1:46:08] Chazmaglazz: If the economy wasn't screwed in wow we could afford things by farming gold in game
[1:46:08] mortmos: HOLY FUCK WHY DOEES EVERYTHINK THAT EVERY BUYS GOLD THAT USES GDKPS
[1:46:08] swolygh0st: GIGACHAD ASMONGOLD
[1:46:08] bigwilly3737: he is right lmao u guys are dumb
[1:46:08] zer0_the_legend: Asmon doesn't even play this game anymore
[1:46:10] Naxonus: I hate how he says that cause he doesn't even play the game, let alone ever do GDKP's lol
[1:46:11] Exusprime: Xaryu seeing though it
[1:46:12] twistedbinkz: L TAKE
[1:46:12] ralphh1541: rare L take from Asmon here
[1:46:13] SoCal_Badfish: L take
[1:46:14] berserage95: HE RAISED HIS VOICE HES RIGHT!
[1:46:15] PeterZwegatStarcraft: bad take
[1:46:15] surrena: gold is pointless now, atleast in retail
[1:46:16] Zerksyera: I AGREE WITH ASMON for once
[1:46:16] SurrealAndre: oh no big streamer angry at game he barely plays
[1:46:17] Spifer011: L
[1:46:17] Xeliumimar: LOL
[1:46:17] Cant0n: Bedge this guy man
[1:46:19] Vichrinox: @Xaryu  I honestly think the answer is somewhere in between what you and Asmon are saying
[1:46:22] fiftyfiftyyes: ye blizz is trying to slow the time until they got banned KappaRoss the sub is precious
[1:46:23] coolcoolcool777dood: Xaryu u are wrong in this one man, it is so easy to see who is buying and selling it.. sooo easy..
[1:46:24] metastasized: so much for giving the editors a content break! this is gold
[1:46:25] fabulais: @Reaperz_kinetic Asmon is prob the mos down to earth guy in twtich, wtf, y'all just hate the baldness
[1:46:26] notMuklukian: same
[1:46:26] JeSsEReApEr: @xaryu why doesn’t blizzard just hire people to go to gold selling websites and pretend to buy gold to find the sellers and ban them?
[1:46:27] Arisnadia: bro wtf, blizzard doesn't want to? what evidence he has that they are not doing anything?
[1:46:27] B_Rize: He’s right, chat is dumb af lol
[1:46:27] Pixiepantss: Clap
[1:46:29] macjcool: Asmons take is if you dont agree with me then fuck you
[1:46:31] Genghjs: My grandmother used to tell me stories about the old days, a time of peace when the GM's kept balance between the Players, Blizzard, Bots, and Streamers. But that all changed when the Bots attacked. Only the GM mastered all four elements. Only he could stop the ruthless Bots , but when the world needed him most, he vanished
[1:46:31] zebercetanayurt: his logic is exactly the forever victim crowd. we know who they are
[1:46:32] Spikeqc: cook em asmon NODDERS
[1:46:32] grubols: ok
[1:46:33] thatdogbitme: this is a bad faith take imo
[1:46:33] Frolul: now ppl gotta pick up herbs to make gold lmao
[1:46:34] bigwilly3737: hes right lol dumb chat
[1:46:34] rocknsake: yeah, i like asmon but he's jaded cause he gets free gold handed to him constantly
[1:46:35] ubbi__: not gonna lie, he had us in the first half
[1:46:36] nakht__: a lot of what asmongold says is smart - this is based on the premise of blizzard not doing anything - evidence we have is that they ARE doing something
[1:46:36] bazzzzzzz: :D so much humility :D
[1:46:38] Tbiz87: where does he think all that gold that was donated to him came from lmao
[1:46:38] luravi: Asmon is a hypocrite he took gold donations of viewers who bought hold
[1:46:39] graycatbirds: "humility" LULW
[1:46:39] sinfullfilled: what is he saying lol
[1:46:39] picanhatv: humility? lmao
[1:46:40] Valae1: how can u not agree that gdkps are good if gold selling was not possible
[1:46:40] treyywow: people act like GDKPS WERE A THING BEFORE BACK IN THE DAY AND ITS NOT TRUE GDKPS WERE ALWAYS UNETHICAL
[1:46:42] zer0_the_legend: The games gonna be exactly the same except you can't buy gear...lol
[1:46:43] coolcoolcool777dood: Xaryu u are wrong in this one man, it is so easy to see who is buying and selling it.. sooo easy...
[1:46:47] king___slender: This guy legit does not leave his house and people care what he thinks
[1:46:48] catbalou2: If he ever had any credibility...its gone now
[1:46:48] FlyLikeAnAngel: he doesnt really play fr
[1:46:48] berserage95: asmon looks too much like a hippy look at that hair
[1:46:50] Curtsy: thinking the majority is wrong is not humility xaryu lol
[1:46:51] drinkingcoldbeer: yay reddit nerds get there way
[1:46:51] B4SEDTOBY: thats the best thing he could have ended it on
[1:46:52] TheEndIsNear777: Gdkps are bad wether 2008 or 2020
[1:46:53] tellmeagainiforgot: YOUR FKING STUPID, humility shown +1
[1:46:55] shadowthehedgehog97: sometimes asmon just says who gives a shit and sometimes hes super emotional like this. dont get this guy rly xd
[1:46:55] AnyroadTwo: @thatdogbitme Lowering incentives and increasing risk is a very effective way to combat unwanted behaviors
[1:46:57] ninobambinow: HUGE W ASMON
[1:46:58] Muttermundharmonika168: But majority of people ar not that smart Kappa
[1:46:58] Pepzsi: Are we beta testing democracy ?
[1:46:58] bigwilly3737: xar hes right lol
[1:47:01] Spikeqc: minority report, watch party ok
[1:47:01] TheEndIsNear777: There is bots and gold selling so gdkps = bad
[1:47:01] FezzikGG: @Xaryu if you check my past messages I have talked about that. Standard economics, you punish the buyer and that removes demand.   The Sodapoppin situation is the biggest frustration here since Blizzard is talking about permas for GDKPs but not for buying gold directly. The community doesn't trust blizzard
[1:47:03] paz_lmao: god damn chat is fried today lmfao
[1:47:08] sneakyPizzA: im curious how they're actually go about banning them,  most of them are just advertised through discords anyways
[1:47:08] Akompliss: Asmon doesn't even play SOD
[1:47:09] myfellowpurgers2: "i can't play the game this way" YES you cant play the game in a way that incentivizes breaking tos and ruins the game for other players
[1:47:09] TrooperHuge: He wants it that way so he can log in and get items he wants fast and not grind
[1:47:10] squarepusher_: I'll accept his humility when he admits to buying glad boosts from Metaphorz and SSDS
[1:47:12] B_Rize: Xar he’s actually right on this one
[1:47:12] Pixiepantss: yup
[1:47:13] thatdogbitme: @AnyroadTwo agreed
[1:47:14] bigwilly3737: thats not a punishment??
[1:47:14] FlowersAnger: Asmon used at least 3 brain ceclls for this video, maybe only two, but definitely more than one.
[1:47:14] wookinit: 100%
[1:47:17] coolcoolcool777dood: Xaryu u are wrong in this one man, it is so easy to see who is buying and selling it.. sooo easy..
[1:47:17] phinn_insertclass: it’s not as black and white man. people have been buying gold since the dawn of time. if you get caught you get a slap on the wrist. they need to make an example of people and close accounts.
[1:47:18] Ervill1: got to block a few biggest L chatters in this session to save my chat experience = W
[1:47:18] Oodyny: What if the majority is wrong ? stupid way of thinking, majority doesnt equal right
[1:47:19] notMuklukian: they deleted the item from his bags too
[1:47:19] treyywow: GDKPS WERE NOT COMMON BACK IN THE DAY ITS ALL CAP
[1:47:20] Reaperz_kinetic: @fabulais how was i hating LMFAOO i enjoy watching asmon but the dude wasnt wrong... asmon is just a dude whos only ever made wow vids... he has no real knowledge on the background information behind cyber security and hes acting like he does
[1:47:24] Destro82: GDKP who cares u can join those raids if u want to not all raids are GDKP
[1:47:26] ElephantSurfer: he should have been giga banned lol
[1:47:27] Naxonus: I very much enjoy Asmon, been watching him since his MoP youtube days, but he has openly admitted to scimming off the top of the pot in GDKP's back in the day so of course he would defend it
[1:47:29] Astralthundr: trying SOMETHING is better than NOTHING, its a start
[1:47:30] vision42g: buyin gold in hardcore lame af
[1:47:32] Akompliss: They would've banned anyone else. They were so blatant about it in Onlyfangs
[1:47:32] macjcool: they are trying, there are just too god damn many
[1:47:32] ruperttheyeti: 4Head why not jsut do it
[1:47:32] daigurren2: They did not take all his gold away KEKW
[1:47:33] Hellacat: thats why gold buying is so bad in SOD. The Soda punishment happened right before sod launched.
[1:47:34] Vichrinox: hes right but painting with too wide of a paint brush
[1:47:35] Pixiepantss: NODDERS
[1:47:36] Hellacat: everyone saw it.
[1:47:37] smaftyz: @Destro82 until they are like in wotlk.
[1:47:37] Mico027: Thats what they're gonna do, they just added a rule :)
[1:47:38] Spikeqc: NODDERS
[1:47:41] bigwilly3737: @treyywow you must of not played the game it was popular back in the day lol
[1:47:41] thebookeu: KEKW
[1:47:43] Xzanelol: exactly
[1:47:43] myfellowpurgers2: yuppers
[1:47:44] albuquerquez_joze: we hasnt banned because is a huige streamer that bring a lot of views to hardcore
[1:47:46] Boruox: def
[1:47:46] handovdoom666: its funny coming from someone that just sits in SW and asks for gold
[1:47:48] Sterlinekinetic: i agree
[1:47:49] RockyMountainOyster: oh yeah it was 100% cause of the content
[1:47:51] polesreport: yup for sure
[1:47:52] sircrumpler: There problem when the very existence of gdkp will gradually inflate the AH ECONOMY
[1:47:52] Pixiepantss: $$$$$$$$$$$$$
[1:47:53] brie_feusang: Asmongold is like a 13 year old boy with his takes lmfao
[1:47:55] Arisnadia: because you literally have programs creating accounts 24/7 how hard is that to understand?.
[1:47:56] shabomination: Rules for thee, huh
[1:47:56] Naxonus: Yeah for sure
[1:47:57] seven__h: They can't figure it out because they'd make less money if they figured it out, its literally not about anything else
[1:47:57] CodeValor: Because botters and gold sellers aren't stupid. They know what they're doing, just like how Blizzard knows what its doing.
[1:47:57] treyywow: $$$$$$
[1:47:58] tilldawn: oh yeah for sure
[1:47:58] Tydus_HW: @bigwilly3737 it all hinges on whether you believe Blizzard take action against botters and buyers
[1:47:58] Xzanelol: if asmon himself admits his friend deserves a ban.. then yeah
[1:47:59] mortmos: Thats an L trank
[1:47:59] fanniclap: lmfao yes how hard is that to realize? HE IS A HUGE part of wow
[1:47:59] macjcool: WOuld have been the perfect time to show they mean business
[1:47:59] Seoken1: it would be an IDIOTIC business decision if they banned Soda LUL
[1:47:59] TheNJV: but I think that would of been best long term
[1:47:59] Destro82: anyone can create their own raid and not make it gdkp
[1:47:59] flyypants: 100%
[1:48:00] polesreport: it was PR to not ban Soda
[1:48:00] limed_: @Naxonus guy gets thousands of gold from viewers ofc he is biased towards it
[1:48:00] Genghjs: Spineless
[1:48:00] sircrumpler: They did

[1:48:01] sweglordyoloson1337: noo its the same for all buyers
[1:48:02] Harrychongdong: only things?
[1:48:03] treyywow: $$$$$
[1:48:04] B_Rize: They should have banned him
[1:48:04] Seoken1: They made the right choice
[1:48:04] EzriDax: I’m sad to OF stuff is over.
[1:48:05] graziNNN: Soda bought gold in OnlyFangs?! KEKW
[1:48:06] Woah_Zerk: The ToS should be indiscriminatory. He deserved a bad
[1:48:06] Nungiven: That's special treatment
[1:48:07] FezzikGG: That shouldn't matter. He broke TOS and you have to be consistent
[1:48:07] phinn_insertclass: if they banned the literal leader it would set the example they need!
[1:48:08] FullySuited: yepBanana
[1:48:08] wookinit: @treyywow yep gdkps literally started around ZG raids
[1:48:09] polesreport: streamer benefits for sure
[1:48:09] Boruox: 100% would have been a riot
[1:48:09] loopin0003: Wrong decision, he should have been banned 100%
[1:48:09] ocoj: Blizz obviously are trying to ban people lol. His argument that they’re not trying doesn’t even make sense
[1:48:09] Woah_Zerk: ban*
[1:48:10] JackLarsen4: you can find the gold buyers just because they dont doesnt mean you cant
[1:48:10] estrelolthereal: What's the best way to find a guild
[1:48:10] ralphyyx3: a riot doesnt matter
[1:48:11] ralphh1541: who cares about streamers
[1:48:11] calmtree: Hurt the game to protect streamers
[1:48:11] Spikeqc: yepBanana
[1:48:12] zebercetanayurt: asmongold = teenager & boomer in one person
[1:48:13] Hellacat: g2g business doubled overnight from that decision.
[1:48:13] pandemanium_tv: nah someone would have stepped up all 39 other raiders
[1:48:14] sircrumpler: The onlyfang guild run was massive publicity
[1:48:14] SarcasticApe: would be a good statement if they banned him
[1:48:14] Akompliss: Nah, that's dogsh*t though. I don't care who you are, the rules should apply to everyone.
[1:48:17] TheMysticBean: It's not that, i got a week ban for buying 30k in wrath. they arent strict enough. 2 weeks later bought another 20k and never got caught
[1:48:17] yeezeusy: reckful ban ;-;
[1:48:18] MonkeyOverlord: Onlyfangs got me back into WoW right before SoD. And now SoD is cradling me like a little baby.
[1:48:19] darkwingduck06: Rules only apply to some lol
[1:48:19] Curtsy: @treyywow bro you're using cap unironically, you're too young to have played back in the day
[1:48:20] B_Rize: Streamer privilege is sickening
[1:48:20] Jasperx0: How do you stop someone buying som1 gold to get them banned then
[1:48:20] Reaperz_kinetic: @ocoj exactly
[1:48:20] Xzanelol: @estrelolthereal server discords
[1:48:21] Seoken1: They made the right business decision, different than the correct decision or ethical decision @Xaryu
[1:48:22] EffingDarkSlayr: it must be a pretty large subset of the playerbase. You'd have to think they can figure out who's buying gold but potentially are choosing not to perma them.
[1:48:22] Weddzz: It's so obvious, Blizzard make a lot of money from botters having to buy new accounts - meaning, they need to delay the bans to make it enough profitable for botters to continue.
[1:48:25] joonelius3: exactly! Asmon is making all sense here and the toxic sweaty trolls just cry of gdkp. IF YOU DONT LIKE GDKP DONT PLAY IN GDKPS
[1:48:30] notMuklukian: SoD = PTR LUL
[1:48:31] grubols: I think a lot of ppl don’t catch bans hes right
[1:48:33] LoKuhMuhTive: 100% they should've banned Soda. Soda is streaming to a big audience. Not banning him just shows people they can buy gold and nothing will happen anyway LUL
[1:48:34] Frolul: ppl will still buy gold aint noone trying to farm mobs for hours to make gold
[1:48:36] Arisnadia: how hard is to understand that scripts are updated every minute to bypass the cybersecurity of blizzard.
[1:48:37] budmodeos: they should have just ignored sodas gold buying if they didn’t want an effect from it
[1:48:41] brummE1337: They have not banned any people for gold buying. They suspend in 14 day, and remove some gold (Sometimes). I know one got a ban in 14 days in WoTLK for buying 350k gold, and he had all when he got back 14 days later. Thats is not a punishment!
[1:48:42] vision42g: @joonelius3 YES
[1:48:43] Destro82: i have pugged all sod raids since start and never done gdk p
[1:48:43] Pixiepantss: NODDERS
[1:48:43] coolcoolcool777dood: Xaryu u are wrong in this one man, it is so easy to see who is buying and selling it.. sooo easy..
[1:48:44] Nungiven: All that does is tell streamers if you're big enough no real consequences will come to you
[1:48:44] Reaperz_kinetic: @joonelius3 hes making ZERO sense
[1:48:45] catbalou2: I disagree the higher the profile should b ethe higher the punishment
[1:48:45] king___slender: @joonelius3 it affects everyone else though dum dum
[1:48:47] bigwilly3737: Hes right lol chat is slow
[1:48:48] fanniclap: Asmon makes sense now but 10 min ago chat was saying how he's dumb rofl.
[1:48:52] Pixiepantss: NODDERS NODDERS
[1:48:57] Nativityqt: @joonelius3 The sweaty trolls are the ones buying gold for items LUL
[1:48:57] smaftyz: if you dont like murder just dont murder people!
[1:48:59] brummE1337: so yea, need to perm ban ppl if they do against TOS; maybe not first time - but let ppl know you are doing something wrong atleast
[1:49:00] copper_cloud: asmon giving people to much credit. most players dont know shit about balancing a game
[1:49:00] Spikeqc: FeelsDankMan . o O ( NODDERS  )
[1:49:04] boph4: Asmon, if he means to or not, is saying that Blizzard can't update their terms. They just added GDKP to their TOS... its not in the terms
[1:49:06] B_Rize: They’ll ban GDKPS but not ban boosting??? Makes ZERO sense
[1:49:07] bigwilly3737: i love how u guys were saying he was slow 5 min ago smh clowns
[1:49:12] Reaperz_kinetic: @joonelius3 thats like saying "if you dont like cheaters then just dont cheat" KEKW bad argument
[1:49:12] JackLarsen4: @B_Rize thats a bit dehumanizing of you
[1:49:19] jacobsladder1212: anyone else pumped for the John Cena operator pack for Rets???/
[1:49:19] joonelius3: @king___slender no it doesnt xD gold buying affects other players not gdkp. if you are too lazy to grind gold dont cry about it.
[1:49:21] vision42g: @joonelius3 dont answer them man they wont understand
[1:49:22] boph4: Its now in the terms*
[1:49:24] Spikeqc: NODDERS
[1:49:24] berserage95: he just said its sod so they can test something like this, end of story lets move on
[1:49:25] Valsu: the fact that they cant detect flying is insane
[1:49:30] thatdogbitme: z axis restrictions need to be done yesterday
[1:49:33] Frolul: you are just making harder make gold for a person who had less time to play the game
[1:49:38] logsnar: @joonelius3 I hear you but I think GDKPs encourage more gold buying, which therefore inflate economy in the game. And that way, it impacts everyone even if you don't participate
[1:49:39] Pixiepantss: NODDERS
[1:49:50] iPlayCuzFun: they have new tech to detect bots, and with less bots becauce less gold buyers, we might see a domino effect, where they completely clean up bots and thje gold market
[1:49:52] macjcool: NODDERS
[1:49:55] TheRatRunner: is there a single MMORPG that has successfully removed botting?
[1:49:57] Coffeeraptor: @Valsu who said they cant?
[1:49:59] Exusprime: im happy with that reduction
[1:50:01] Spikeqc: EZ . o O ( NODDERS )
[1:50:01] joonelius3: @vision42g lmao seems so xD
[1:50:04] Reaperz_kinetic: @Frolul sorry but if youre using GDKPs to make gold then youre supporting hackers and gold buyers and gold sellers.... which is an issue
[1:50:07] treyywow: GDKPS WERE NOT COMMON BACK IN THE DAY ITS ALL CAP. GDKPS HAVE ALWAYS BEEN UNETHICAL.
[1:50:09] wookinit: all it takes is one player not getting the staff they want and they report everyone in raid

[1:50:14] SweatyDaniels: can anyone link a safe gold site?
[1:50:15] copper_cloud: create a monopoly on gold selling
[1:50:15] TheNJV: Does Blizzard really want to ban bots tho? Im sure they want to stop gold selling but those people still pay for subscriptions even if its through the wow token
[1:50:16] bigwilly3737: sodapoppin risked his account in front of 10 k ppl live i dont think ppl care about risking their accounts
[1:50:17] SweatyDaniels: haha jk
[1:50:19] Pixiepantss: KEKW
[1:50:20] Pixiepantss: KEKW KEKW
[1:50:24] coolcoolcool777dood: xaryu why are u comparing this to hacking LOL???
[1:50:24] brummE1337: nooope
[1:50:25] Tydus_HW: i bet you cant
[1:50:27] professorslime: I think there will be less people raiding now and more people leaving raid when their gear doesn’t drop half way through
[1:50:29] genmd: they need an invasive anti cheat system. bot detector 9000
[1:50:30] B_Rize: BAN BOOSTING, boosting brings in more RMT than GDKPs
[1:50:34] Tydus_HW: why dont the police remove crime?
[1:50:35] brummE1337: 100% cant remove all, its IMPOSSIBLE
[1:50:39] treyywow: he’s not wrong
[1:50:40] Curtsy: Not a single mmorpg ever made has been able to get rid of 100% of bots, it is literally impossible to do
[1:50:40] zebercetanayurt: THIS BINARY THINKING IS KILLING ME
[1:50:41] Daphud: Hes commenting about gdkps before even watching the botting element of the Sod P2 preview
[1:50:41] grebby71: could you remove bots without removing legit players? no
[1:50:44] macjcool: or they would buy half as much KEKW
[1:50:44] coolcoolcool777dood: ASMON is 100% right...
[1:50:44] Boruox: oooo i agree with that ban the big gold buyers
[1:50:45] Pixiepantss: NODDERS
[1:50:48] Austere_1: @Reaperz_kinetic if you're boosting you're supporting hackers and gold buyers. if you're using the AH you're supporting botters
[1:50:48] coolcoolcool777dood: 100%
[1:50:49] TrooperHuge: I agree with that.
[1:50:50] TMMOOF: What even is the current penalty for botting or buying/selling gold?
[1:50:51] phinn_insertclass: yep
[1:50:52] Pixiepantss: yeah 100%
[1:50:53] selmoTV: they could cap max gold to 10-30k
[1:50:54] chrislu18: this guy is so annoying
[1:50:56] Spikeqc: NODDERS
[1:50:57] sircrumpler: Shoulda been a 24 hr

[1:51:00] Pixiepantss: yupp
[1:51:00] squarepusher_: lolno.
[1:51:00] Beniamin: Nope, I used to reverse engineer WoW, it's hard to stop bots. That was 10 years ago though.
[1:51:00] wookinit: 100%
[1:51:01] ElephantSurfer: yup
[1:51:01] ViciousRI: They did perma ban me...on my gold buying accounts..but not my accounts i moved the gold to
[1:51:03] TMMOOF: 100%
[1:51:04] berserage95: runescape has bots and so do many other games, i cant believe bots are still a topic just leave it to the companies and move on LUL
[1:51:05] Exusprime: Everyone thinks so
[1:51:06] Valsu: decapitate in the town square
[1:51:08] pharmertaniel24: yeah idk how he just got away with it

[1:51:09] brummE1337: 100% that is the biggest issue, they slap them on the wrist
[1:51:09] copper_cloud: Soda just removed you from his friends list for saying that.
[1:51:10] FezzikGG: not buying Soda set a horrible precedent
[1:51:11] thegreatestadam: I got some friends who do it
[1:51:14] Phayntt: you can ban bots all u want, but the reason they do it in big waves every few months is so the bot programmers cant fix their bots as quckly to get around the new detections
[1:51:14] thegreatestadam: but I will never
[1:51:15] Nungiven: He definitely should've been banned. That's special treatment
[1:51:16] pharmertaniel24: even admitted to it
[1:51:16] Jasperx0: what stops someone buying a player gold to get them banned then
[1:51:17] tylive52: so should wow token purchasers get banned as well
[1:51:17] NawtyTyme: soda even said he walked away with just a slap and he was surprised @Xaryu
[1:51:18] king___slender: All you people saying boosting should be banned. You're right about that too
[1:51:19] ElephantSurfer: put his head on a spike like Ned stark (in game)
[1:51:19] Puffypuffs: Blizzard " we dont gaf about streamers GIGACHAD "
[1:51:22] copper_cloud: you are off his battle net
[1:51:23] boph4: Bots are online 24/7 in the same location. Blizzard can ban all tomorrow, but what would that do to their profit?
[1:51:23] MoneyKrusher1: EZ Bliss should sell gold like they sell a mount... Buy gold directly from the blizz store..
[1:51:23] SweatyDaniels: cant get banned if you wash your gold in the AH
[1:51:24] Impurpletoe: Sends a mixed message for retail players how buy otken and blizz likely wants that to continue
[1:51:25] Tydus_HW: people will forgot the ban
[1:51:25] thegreatestadam: and they get sh*t from their friends who don't
[1:51:26] mithcus: what about mitch :D
[1:51:27] Tikomiuss: who is soda? never seen this guy stream Kappa
[1:51:28] TheCraigJr: I got banned for 14 days in SOD and i don't wanna buy gold anymore
[1:51:29] Curtsy: @TMMOOF its a scaling punishment system, goes from temp bans to licence being removed to Bnet account being closed
[1:51:29] ehweron: buying gold is emergent player behavior
[1:51:30] AnyroadTwo: @professorslime This is the problem with a lot of players. People are too selfish. I got all my items in SoD, my character is done. I go to every raid so I can play with my friends and help them gear up.
[1:51:31] yohadue: what about you Kappa
[1:51:32] macjcool: how will asmon get golf if his chat cant buy it to give to him
[1:51:32] xodxx: what do you do with people that convert retail gold to classic? @Xaryu
[1:51:34] Reaperz_kinetic: @Austere_1 youre right if youre boosting you might be supporting them too.. boosting and GDKPs arent a fundamental pillar of wow... the AH is
[1:51:34] EffingDarkSlayr: hes such a major part of the communnity and a source of advertising for them. Would hurt them too if they banned Soda
[1:51:36] Frolul: @reaperz_kinetic isn’t banning gdkp making ppl who cant farm for hours to buy gold now
[1:51:36] Valsu: just enforce rules 4Head
[1:51:37] CyberDase1n: Don’t ban them, let people earn some money jeez
[1:51:38] CodeValor: You shouldn't do THAT part.
[1:51:39] brummE1337: it will drop the amount sure, too some amount. But even then, there is money in it - and for those that do it, they make a shit ton of money for where they live, and such. they live like kings
[1:51:41] GotLuck: when you say "buying gold" do you mean just via third party and not WoW token?
[1:51:41] xpl0yt: less buyers means cheaper gold means more reward to the risk
[1:51:43] coolcoolcool777dood: IDK UNDERSTAND HOW ITS SO CHALLENGING TO UNDERSTAND WHO IS BUYING AND SELLING GOLD. U CAN TRACK EACH TRADE LOL SUCH A JOKE
[1:51:47] TMMOOF: @Curtsy  ty :)
[1:51:48] deathwinguin: mitch bough from soda hes in the clear Kappa
[1:51:48] copper_cloud: if Cdew can cheat in blizzcon just allow gold buying
[1:51:51] xNotorietyx: runescape has TON of gold selling tho
[1:51:53] thatdogbitme: there is def a new ban wave going around, my guild has had several banned over the past week
[1:51:54] B_Rize: BAN BOOSTING
[1:51:55] PuppetInsane: Gold sellers will still sell but probably will have to lower the price since the players looking to buy will be less

[1:52:01] jojoshambho: @thenjv Big bot farms dont pay pay 15$ for their subscription. They work around the sub fee by buying the wow sub from 3rd world locations. The sub fee is DRASTICALLY cheaper and they make A LOT less money than you think from bot subs.
[1:52:03] brummE1337: wont be able to remove those people way of living, for a better life. Just not happening, same goes iwth pirates on the water, they are still there - been battling them for ages
[1:52:07] treyywow: make all the gold the same/linked over all the versions of the game Kappa
[1:52:13] berserage95: this bot talk is so old LUL theres nothing that can be said about it just leave it up to the devs to sort it out
[1:52:20] synix55: reduce demand.. i've played other mmo's where gold is not a big deal, no reason to buy it. In WoW, especially classic, gold is vital, and hard to get.  change that.
[1:52:21] Greencaps07: he might be talking about banning the public ppl but even then they are bad with back peddling
[1:52:23] crobeamer: When I bought gold , Blizzard sent me in-game mail, warning meit is a risk to my account

[1:53:06] lampsterof79: Banning bots right now they can get right back to 25 in less than a day on a new acct.  I think 50% XP bonus to 25 in Phase 2 will only help bots get the max level before getting banned again.

[1:53:19] thebookeu: i think he meant that with enough game knowledge you would be ably to actively find the bots out @Xaryu
[1:53:19] smaftyz: why is this even being discussed? If you think GDKP is good for the game you have cognitive issues
[1:53:20] Akompliss: IP  and hardware bans
[1:53:22] Reaperz_kinetic: asmon in reality doesnt know what hes talking about.. hes entitled to his opinion but he has absolutely ZERO knowledge when it comes to cybersecurity and botting
[1:53:22] bbhank1: phase 2 changes looking like a massive w
[1:53:23] btjc89: just like the police vs crime
[1:53:23] AbsoluteDespair: yES
[1:53:23] Pixiepantss: NODDERS
[1:53:24] sunnysidescrambled: there's 5000 hunters with chinese pet names farming in the open RN
[1:53:24] PuppetInsane: if they keep baning them 24/7 they will quit coming back eventually, because they need to profit to keep running the bots/gold selling
[1:53:27] Spikeqc: NODDERS
[1:53:27] biingb0ng: Job security
[1:53:27] Reaperz_kinetic: YES actually LMFAOO
[1:53:29] Kuppjark: Asmongold is a GOD he can do anything haha
[1:53:29] polesreport: what? lol
[1:53:30] macjcool: Guys Asmon litterally wrote the ENTIRE CODE for WOW, HE KNOWS!
[1:53:30] disciple007: no money to be had on private servers tho right
[1:53:32] lumi929: engineering is hard bros
[1:53:32] Soarlozer: private server are much smaller lmao
[1:53:32] acaciashrub: no one who has money to buy mad gold is gonna just stop playing once their account is banned…. they make new account instantly
[1:53:34] TheDeavs: Random captchas during play out of combat
[1:53:35] professorslime: if they get 10,000 players from a 3rd world country in a day that’s pretty obvious bots
[1:53:36] andross789: But now they have more to try to ban how does that help?
[1:53:36] SirKalikan: private servers are SOO much smaller. lmao
[1:53:37] Akompliss: In fact, just ban accounts out of China. Sorry
[1:53:41] espi: nobody is botting private servers because there's no point to buy gold there lmao
[1:53:42] berserage95: wow his takes are so dogshit, he just asked why more bots on retail to private?
[1:53:43] TrooperHuge: When was the last time he played WoW and got gold the right way?
[1:53:43] Cenarios13: @Soarlozer they have way better anticheat
[1:53:43] eltoroblanko: theres no money in botting private servers thats y
[1:53:43] Pixiepantss: yes
[1:53:45] Drakothius: official has way more players = more buyers
[1:53:48] BWAttila: The problem is if they ban the sellers they come back right away and find a different way, but if they ban the buyers than they get scared and stop buying.
[1:53:52] bigwilly3737: yes thats what a gdkp is lol
[1:53:53] brummE1337: yup, exactly @Xaryu
[1:53:53] jiggyspice: Setting up bot farms is expensive initally and long term payout. Private server has no long term overhead to justify the setup
[1:53:55] giantbuckethead: The scale of the service changes the scale of the problem, which changes how you have to respond to the problem.
[1:53:56] tw1ZTER: CAPTCHAS every 15 min POGSLIDE
[1:53:56] daigurren2: Thats how GDKPs are going to be run now lol
[1:53:59] Spikeqc: we live in a barbie world NODDERS
[1:53:59] adam_brisbane: can you pay for boosting still?
[1:54:05] burnsthedude: I work in data security and it’s actually not that hard to use metrics to accurately find accounts that are breaking your tos - just looking at transaction data you can filter out who’s a bot
[1:54:05] Curtsy: @espi you are completely delusional if you think people do not bot on p servers my dude
[1:54:08] mortmos: asmon is actually so fucking stipid
[1:54:10] macjcool: Its time to cut the losses with the hair
[1:54:10] polesreport: well lets see how it goes
[1:54:14] treyywow: asmon started playing wow the day Warcraft 3 launched you kno nothing
[1:54:14] B_Rize: FACTS
[1:54:15] mortmos: no one is buying TONS of gold for SOD
[1:54:15] Destro82: have fun farming for 12 hours to get 10gold
[1:54:18] smaftyz: @daigurren2 people are gonna buy a BFD run? xD
[1:54:19] Pixiepantss: NODDERS
[1:54:21] Arisnadia: omg how oblivious he can get
[1:54:22] 4PK20: @Xaryu react to my hc death - skull rock 8/8 BWL guild - https://www.twitch.tv/4pk20/clip/FreezingPlumpClintPMSTwin-Qrt1xWNSNi9J_YHa
[1:54:25] Cant0n: NOPERS
[1:54:25] Nonprophetx: in a perfect world he would have to farm his gold instead of it being gifted from all his streamers lol
[1:54:26] graycatbirds: people actually watch asmongold Aware
[1:54:27] CHICKENARMSANDLEGS: it most def is
[1:54:28] bigwilly3737: @mortmos hes literally right your just mad bc hes a big streamer and hes speaking facts
[1:54:29] FezzikGG: boosting is now a gray area. They didn't mention that specifically @Xaryu
[1:54:29] Boats_NW: what other reason is there to really buy gold though
[1:54:29] polesreport: doesnt hurt to test it for 3 months and see what happens
[1:54:29] eltoroblanko: let people buy gold, stop crying
[1:54:30] zephyshomm: people are too lazy to play the game and make gold legit
[1:54:30] shadowthehedgehog97: i dont think gdkp is this important jesus christ lol
[1:54:30] catbalou2: Listen to the Almight Messiah Asmon he knows all always about anything
[1:54:31] Knocktoff: thats a very small minority though
[1:54:31] Curtsy: @smaftyz people have been buying bfd runs for months now
[1:54:31] v0gz: L asmon take
[1:54:35] Arisnadia: you can't separate one thing from another, you have to see things in general
[1:54:36] Spikeqc: IRS KKona
[1:54:36] Sablehawk_TV: Is he even playing sod?
[1:54:37] Frolul: @reaperz_kinetic i played on a server where gdkps werent a thing when classic released in 2019 flask/potion prices where very high that only ppl could afford were buying gold/farming for hours
[1:54:37] B_Rize: FACTSSS
[1:54:38] stegoprime: So he shouldnt take medicine to alleviate the symptoms by that logic...Asmon is so dumb
[1:54:40] IIezyII: I think its a brillant take
[1:54:40] Pixiepantss: LOL
[1:54:41] sargent_baddy: True I dont buy gold and I love GDKPs
[1:54:42] Puffypuffs: BasedGod
[1:54:42] d4m13nGR: GDKPs ARE NOT A SYMPTOM THEY ARE THE MAIN REASON PEOPLE BOT AND BUY GOLD
[1:54:42] OPlNEL13: the only reason of the GDKP ban is not only to reduce gold buying
[1:54:43] larnsmarf: ive never had to buy gear? i just farm drops i dont get it
[1:54:43] BarCassi: not fair for streamers like you that gets gold from the simps
[1:54:44] swolygh0st: LEGITIMATE GDKP ENJOYER FeelsBadMan
[1:54:44] BWAttila: I bought gold, got banned for 2 weeks and never bought it again cuz my playtime was more important than the g...
[1:54:44] Curtsy: mmorpgs have had tools to track gold for 20+ years
[1:54:44] IIezyII: this whole rant has been good
[1:54:46] smaftyz: @Destro82 if you use 12 hours to get 10 hours I dont know what to tell you lmaoooo
[1:54:47] TheMysticBean: @smaftyz Yeah they'll just buy a full run or do it through discord lol
[1:54:47] Genertec: there are no legitimate players in gdkps xd
[1:54:48] regularpers: i disagree, they should do both
[1:54:49] sumdumphuk: I legit haven't seen one gdkp advertised on my server anyway
[1:54:50] Runekdabest: L take
[1:54:52] vision42g: they gonna call it guild carries now they gotta ban carries too
[1:54:52] MarkyOchoa: GDKPs create more need to buy gold. To solve the gold buying problem you need to eliminate the need. WoW Token does that unfortunately it's a necessary evil.
[1:54:52] jacksunson: Asmon knows everything. trust me bro
[1:54:52] d_droplet: True KEKW
[1:54:52] mortmos: @bigwilly3737 Yeah, and you are just agreeing with a big streamer
[1:54:55] kkzam: lol theres no RIGHT to run gdkps
[1:54:56] gizzle1026: of course it's "not fair". that's why all rules are made lol
[1:54:56] mirc92: lol - a guy who has never worked a real job
[1:54:56] xinroc: im a proffesional racer, its unfair to me that i cant speed on highways
[1:54:57] StandardOut: Look up Guilds, look up guild members, look up gold movement history.
[1:54:58] jaredfrasas93: Love the guy, but he's really out of his element here
[1:55:01] tw1ZTER: im sorry im out, im losing brain cells
[1:55:01] thatdogbitme: its an outlet for gold buying, there are a lot of other methods for loot distribution that don't involve direct gold transactions
[1:55:02] daigurren2: @daigurren2 Gnomer run but yes 100%. then they get loot bacause the other people are full bis
[1:55:02] szado_man: the whole world is based on money :(
[1:55:03] CHICKENARMSANDLEGS: people buy more gold when theres gdkps lol its simple
[1:55:04] zer0_the_legend: The bots create the inflation
[1:55:04] Phayntt: team of 5 people have to now go thorugh hundreds of thousands of peoples gold income good luck
[1:55:05] rebel_fire_t: man this guy really is mid IQ

[1:55:07] Helios0ne: bidenomics
[1:55:09] sargent_baddy: Buying gold ruins the economy
[1:55:10] Pixiepantss: NODDERS
[1:55:12] taco_soprano: I don't buy gold for them and don't buy gear, I just carry for their bought gold GIGACHAD
[1:55:13] Spikeqc: NODDERS
[1:55:15] Ace0fSpades6: bots ruins economy
[1:55:15] professorslime: inflating the price of southbound items?
[1:55:16] espi: he's just talking in circle
[1:55:16] iPlayCuzFun: GDKPs started in china 2007 because ppl found it better to buy gold off bots, so GDKP is a direct result of gold buying
[1:55:17] naturalduck: Gdkp rewards gold buying
[1:55:17] bigwilly3737: @mortmos im agreeing bc hes right lol your just slow its ok
[1:55:18] berserage95: how long is it gonna take for asmon to be dethroned as the opinion for all wow players zz
[1:55:19] williwhite94: people buy gold to join the GDKP the reason they BUY gold is for the GDKP lmao
[1:55:20] Lara_TV_: Bruh
[1:55:20] jopovt: speaking FACTS
[1:55:22] B_Rize: Asmon spitting facts
[1:55:22] RuskoBanane: gdkp leader reselling his own gold he sold
[1:55:24] treyywow: ok he lost me here
[1:55:24] fgaudreau05: No way you can compete bid in gdkp if you are not buying gold
[1:55:25] coolcoolcool777dood: BOTTING INFLATES THE ECONOMY, THEN SELLING IT EASE INFLATES IT
[1:55:25] Pixiepantss: yupyup
[1:55:27] Arisnadia: but why are they buying gold?, to run gdkps
[1:55:27] macjcool: Bots dont spend gold?
[1:55:27] fanniclap: imagine thinking asmons actually dumb
[1:55:28] Mico027: Less use for gold = less gold buying
[1:55:28] d4m13nGR: Such a dumb argument. Why do people buy gold?
[1:55:29] mortmos: @bigwilly3737 You are so fucking dumb lmao
[1:55:29] StandardOut: This is a dumb argument
[1:55:30] jaxismynam3: ITS LIKE PRINTING GOLD!!!
[1:55:30] Nicholas909: TRUE
[1:55:30] CHICKENARMSANDLEGS: it is when u buy from bots lol
[1:55:31] StreamElements: Stay connected in Discord -> https://discord.gg/xaryu
[1:55:31] GandaGames: GDKPs incentivize gold buying
[1:55:32] vision42g: @taco_soprano GIGACHAD same
[1:55:32] Curtsy: holy fuck what a disingenuous position OMEGALUL
[1:55:33] Omypulls: it’s always like this, even in real life. others ruin it for the rest
[1:55:33] treyywow: gdkps ruin the game
[1:55:33] Reaperz_kinetic: asmons logic is so flawed and ignorant oml
[1:55:34] iPlayCuzFun: lmao ofc it is
[1:55:34] Carbsxo: gold buying does affect AH prices though
[1:55:35] TrueNosus: this is kinda why i dont like watching asmon, dude kinda just talks in circles sometimes :P
[1:55:35] blasphemousfaith: he talk bullshits
[1:55:36] AnyroadTwo: Shifting large amounts of gold to a few guild is bad for the economy too.
[1:55:36] StandardOut: IT IS PRINTING GOLD
[1:55:40] Coin_: don't really agree. GDKP's create the demand for gold in a way nothing else does in vanilla
[1:55:40] Pixiepantss: NODDERS
[1:55:40] alexgoat94: Asmon made me change my W to an L now!
[1:55:42] brie_feusang: I agree with both of you I think that's why this topic is so polarized
[1:55:42] treyywow: for gdkps
[1:55:42] EffingDarkSlayr: the gold being bought would not exist or be used without being sold
[1:55:42] SlapdickWoWplayer: cry more
[1:55:43] blasphemousfaith: excuse self
[1:55:44] smaftyz: @TheMysticBean sure a fraction of really antisocial people will do that, not gonna be a problem like gdkp
[1:55:45] coolcoolcool777dood: ASMON IS 100% RIGHT
[1:55:45] macjcool: THe bots dont use the gold, hes wrong
[1:55:45] Exxii11: but people buy gold because of gdkp HUH
[1:55:46] taco_soprano: @vision42g 🤝 GIGACHAD
[1:55:46] DrRedford: Because he can see 10 bad gold buyers he thinks he knows them all, obv theres so much more that he doesn't see. this is classic Dunning Kruger
[1:55:47] logsnar: well yeah but if you can't buy gear with gold then there's less of a reason to buy gold...no?
[1:55:49] thatdogbitme: this is a silly take, target both and move on
[1:55:49] grubols: they can buy gold from blizzard tho
[1:55:49] naturalduck: People wouldn't buy gold if gdkps didn't exist
[1:55:52] berserage95: @Xaryu for the love of god why are we listening to someone who doesnt even play the game
[1:55:52] iPlayCuzFun: he argues against himself
[1:55:52] treyywow: they are buying gold for gdkps wtf
[1:55:53] Destro82: no gold buyers everyone farming stuff for gold then areas will be packed with people so it will harder to level and stuff
[1:55:54] BarCassi: but its not the real meaning of forming a group and win with luck
[1:55:55] Reaperz_kinetic: @coolcoolcool777dood no hes not lol
[1:55:55] fetza108: gdkp would be okay but not becaue people are buying golds sooo yes gdkp promote more buginy gold
[1:55:56] Tydus_HW: what does he think the bots are botting for?
[1:55:56] jiggyspice: L take by asmon lol
[1:55:57] simonn992: so does Auction House, lets bann it??
[1:55:57] Thulge: The problem is gold buying isn't going anywhere
[1:55:57] TheMysticBean: @d4m13nGR They dont only buy it for gdkps though, to level proffs, mounts, AH boes, crafting
[1:55:58] archer2342: GDKP causes inflation because what people would pay for an item in raid that BOE could become thousands of gold because of it.
[1:55:58] bigwilly3737: @mortmos hes 100% right lol pls go back to school
[1:55:58] mortmos: IF YOU WANTED GDKPS YOU ARE A ABAD PLAYER
[1:55:59] espi: he's just talking in circle, yes the problem is botting, killing GDKPs is to diminish botting
[1:56:02] Arisnadia: Buy gold -> run gdkp -> why run gdkp -> because you bought gold -> what you do with gold -> run gdkps.
[1:56:02] grubols: like with wow token this is theonly way
[1:56:02] 13Semka: guys is starting playing WoW for pvp content good idea?
[1:56:03] B_Rize: W take Asmon
[1:56:03] williwhite94: its not 100% one or the other its like 70% bots gold making and then 30% GDKPs
[1:56:03] fetza108: its a cycle
[1:56:04] TheDeavs: Wrong dude, you are cutting out the part where a major part of wanting to gold but makes more buy gold for top gear
[1:56:05] Libertas09: They incentivize that action by giving a gold outlet, but its not the moment of the inflation
[1:56:05] bamfosaurus: asmon is so wrong here lmfao bots are literally printing gold and people are buying it and going into gdkps for gear. why would people buy gold if there are no gdkps?
[1:56:06] nebby1122233: lol im just gonna buy gold if i can't earn gold in gdkps
[1:56:07] Nonprophetx: it makes gold buying less attractive because all you need to buy now is consumeables
[1:56:09] nebby1122233: KEWK KEKW KEKW
[1:56:10] dildyj: GDKP is a fantastic method of loot distribution. If there were no bots, it would be amazing. Bots are the problems, not GDKPs.
[1:56:10] TheDeavs: Wrong as in asmons take lol
[1:56:11] mortmos: @bigwilly3737 Touch grass please
[1:56:12] jaketheham: this is just like ban guns and there will be no shootings
[1:56:13] ZerfOG: gold buying is going no where because of this change 100000000%
[1:56:13] professorslime: that guy who buys gold is still gonna have his epic mount day 1
[1:56:14] Harrychongdong: @DrRedford stop using words you dont know
[1:56:14] EffingDarkSlayr: GDKPs effectively launder the bought gold into the economy too
[1:56:14] Seoken1: @Xaryu The price of gold has dropped 30-50% on some servers overnight, I wonder why that is @Xaryu
[1:56:15] jiggyspice: its basic supply and demand lol
[1:56:15] Sterlinekinetic: its always lame good guys being restricted because to many *redacted*
[1:56:19] mcnannerpuss: Asmon is a bit out of touch with this take. you have to remove the incentive to buy good. period.
[1:56:19] fabulais: @Destro82 Ok Swiper, no more swiping for you, lmao
[1:56:23] Doimos89: You can still buy gold from blizzard
[1:56:23] B_Rize: BAN BOTS AND BAN GOLD BUYING, DONT BAN GDKPS
[1:56:24] macjcool: one time cost
[1:56:25] espi: ?????????
[1:56:26] ngl85: they want to reduce the demand for gold so that it is no longer profitable to sell gold
[1:56:26] polesreport: banning GDKPs are cutting the funnel farther down than at the top
[1:56:26] swolygh0st: REMOVE BOOSTING AND BOE'S DansGame
[1:56:26] sm0ke_ggz: yes yes it will
[1:56:26] Sterlinekinetic: like sugar tax
[1:56:28] Fynn_Wolfsheart: i guess
[1:56:28] vision42g: @taco_soprano this is bad for us brother out kids gonna be hungry
[1:56:29] williwhite94: @bamfosaurus asmon doesnt even play or do GDKPs lol
[1:56:29] socketslol: @xaryu Its a pretty big L as much as I don't necessarily like the gold buying but the system is respected because its more fair than most LC teams and the RNG of /roll! You probably would've rolled against 12 players and probably lost anyways or a Loot Council wouldve just given it to someone else @Xaryu - I have 2000 ppl in my discord server as GDKP host in WotLK and I have like 3-5 whales - the ratio is so small and after like 4-5 GDKPS everyone has 200k+ - if the gold is in the economyalready
[1:56:30] Tbiz87: i still dont think gdkp do anything good for the game
[1:56:30] Lara_TV_: Mount is fixed cost
[1:56:31] Nonprophetx: not 100k worth of gold to buy a mount for 40g
[1:56:31] treyywow: GDKPS STARTED FOR THE GOLD BUYERS THEY WERE NOT COMMON BACK IN THE DAY AT ALL
[1:56:31] d4m13nGR: @TheMysticBean you can earn more than enough gold for all of these by playing. There is no need to have thousands of gold other than GDKPs
[1:56:33] catbalou2: I think he is genuinelyso far up his own ass he believes everthing he spouts out
[1:56:34] giantbuckethead: GDKPs are more like a form of money laundering.
[1:56:37] Arisnadia: the mount doesnt cost 40k
[1:56:37] Pixiepantss: LOL
[1:56:37] Spikeqc: D:
[1:56:37] Fynn_Wolfsheart: they buy it then with real money over discord

[1:56:54] TheMysticBean: @d4m13nGR People don't wanna spend their time grinding for gold though. Thats why people buy it. Myself included

[1:57:36] warmupwarri0r: yeah people have been saying that forever. the problem is that if people are buying gold regardless, then the wow token is just a way for blizz to take a cut
[1:57:37] mr__mojo_: at this point they should just ban gold if it’s that big of an issue…
[1:57:38] swolygh0st: REMOVE BOE'S THEY PROMOTE GOLD BUYING!!!
[1:57:39] simonn992: to much money

[1:57:52] Destro82: havent seen any streamer farming stuff for gold
[1:57:52] wigglybob: Yeah buying gold in SoD just makes it feel like retail lol
[1:57:53] smaftyz: @cockowner which is fine, then the mats used for those potions will get inflated prices meaning that you relatively speaking get just as much out of farming
[1:57:53] jilech: my name is jef
[1:57:53] Ervill1: that would be followed by "we are firing 50% of our employees"
[1:57:54] cyrusctff7: Just make the token soul bound.
[1:57:54] Pixiepantss: Kapp
[1:57:55] ekdk91: what about ppl who can play 1 hour a day ? just quit at this point or what
[1:57:56] zxbc1: wow token fully incorporated into economy is how you replace gold farmers with real money transaction, it's the best solution to remove botting

[2:02:08] gory_xd: no1 cares. just watch uberdanger
[2:02:08] giantbuckethead: @Xaryu It's not even to raid to get gear. GDKP becomes the primary "gold farming" method, so you end up wanting to do them whether you get gear or not.
[2:02:08] bahgrahweepnahweepninibum: @Xaryu I think the GDKP meta in modern classic wow has just ruined the overall thematic feel of going through the progression, content, and flavor of the game
[2:02:08] xiClutchBoyix: I have had a really good time running GDKPs, no bad experiences at all.  Been enjoying them.  BUT I still think they game is better with the gone. W.

You probably would've rolled against 12 players and probably lost anyways or a Loot Council wouldve just given it to someone else @Xaryu - I have 2000 ppl in my discord server as GDKP host in WotLK and I have like 3-5 whales - the ratio is so small and after like 4-5 GDKPS everyone has 200k+ - if the gold is in the economyalready

[2:03:28] StripSniper: L in a sense that they lost to bots/rmt
[2:03:28] jujujay_myalias: Some who vote L just knows how to make gold?

[2:03:38] williwhite94: look it at wrath first off u cant join a normal raid you have to join a GDKP and pay up to 200k gold a week LMAO
[2:03:39] Carbsxo: excellent change
[2:03:39] HotTrophyHusband: I think the only problem with banning gdkps is that botters will still exist because boosting still exists and botters make it really hard to make money the old fashioned way and most people were using gdkps to make money off the gold buyers because professions make so much less due to botters
[2:03:39] bbhank1: they are just look at reddit majority likes it
[2:03:40] yellowbrownandred: the root of the problem are the bots, why is this being solved from the top instead of the root of the problem xD
[2:03:41] taco_soprano: @graziNNN I got my heroic one with a natty 100 and WFS with a natty 100 roll too
[2:03:43] Spikeqc: WOT
[2:03:46] Curtsy: @Doimos89 the peaceloom dkp never even happened, it fell apart 5 mins into the raid
[2:03:46] vilness: Asmon explained it perfectly, real problem is not gdkp @Xaryu
[2:03:47] mcnannerpuss: on second thought, GDKPs are a way of dividing bought gold amongst TOS compliant players, no?
[2:03:48] HugzGG: the majority of community is casual
[2:03:49] Reaperz_kinetic: @Greenshield420 you act like theyre not doing that and like its extremely easy to do so
[2:03:50] DynamerX: @Xaryu imagine i wasfarming 12 hours a day, just to know that whenepic staff drops i canbid as muchas i can, i cant imagine so random alt with green items will win roll against me, thats why it is an L, because now people can go online once per 3 days and win rll against me, while iam playing every day and enjooying every piece of content
[2:03:50] bbhank1: YEP
[2:03:51] watchmeblindx: I LOVE GDKP
[2:03:52] iPlayCuzFun: exactly
[2:03:54] watchmeblindx: GOOD FOR OLD PEOPLE
[2:03:54] sk0q: @nectis_ chaos bolt
[2:03:56] jim4201423: the fact they're finally taking a stance on this is a big thing in my eyes
[2:03:56] Karpaa: there wuold be easy method to cure all this. Disable ingame trade and prefix AH prices
[2:03:56] smaftyz: @socketslol yea so make every way of getting gold other than GDKp irrelevant, while making it impossible to get into your first run to start of because you are asked what your budget is, and if you dont have atleast 100 dollars worth of gold you cant join. Big W indeed
[2:03:57] Spikeqc: yepBanana
[2:03:57] l3nnartone: In reality its a W cus this is the most friction blizzard is goin to put against gold buyers. Sure there might be better ways but its just not gonna happend
[2:03:57] trENsomn1AC: just don't go?
[2:03:58] warmupwarri0r: if I am a new player to a phase/raid how do I get into GDKP? They perpetuate the gold for people who have gold and enable gold buying/laundering.
[2:03:58] zer0_the_legend: The removal of GDKP will also make getting rain groups easier if you're not in a guild
[2:03:58] graziNNN: @taco_soprano PogU
[2:03:59] myfellowpurgers2: Why are people ok with something that is TECHNICALLY not against tos but encourages breaking tos? goldbuying is a major problem that can't be fixed by "just ban the sellers and buyers"
[2:04:00] Goji_o7: Majority of players are FRIED cause they've been farming quests instead of making gold
[2:04:00] treyywow: the only people upset about banning gdkps either buy or sell gold
[2:04:02] heyitsken_: hi mom
[2:04:02] bigwilly3737: bc 87% of wow players are casuals and dont realize that gold buying isnt going away bc gdkps are being banned
[2:04:04] gti9: GDKP suck in all way possible sorry
[2:04:04] Zerksyera: problem is gold buying not GDKp, fact
[2:04:05] LilTaisu: They should just ban bots not gdkps but I will leave it at that
[2:04:06] iPlayCuzFun: GDKPs in the best of worlds would be really fun

[2:04:08] wookinit: dude people in gdkps will buy an items just so another player dosent get it
[2:04:09] bahgrahweepnahweepninibum: @Xaryu I think the GDKP meta in modern classic wow has just ruined the overall thematic feel of going through the progression, content, and flavor of the game
[2:04:09] Burritosalad: Azamous is gonna be furious about this
[2:04:10] LegendOfKilla: what a day EZ
[2:04:10] Deathbloomzx: poor Amphy
[2:04:11] AwakenRevelation: I had a good experience in Wotlk with a GDKP run because I wasn't in a guild. I was a good experience for me and got a share of the gold at the end. Perhaps not everyone, including Xaryu, haven't had the best experience, so I do understand regardless.
[2:04:11] jiggyspice: Coincidentally I saw the prices for gold dropped massively already LUL
[2:04:12] MidhirYlis: I have 120g on my hunter in sod without gdkp and buying gold or mass farming/selling items.  fuck gdkp
[2:04:13] Omypulls: take it all away, and bring it back later
[2:04:17] Athos70: just play Lost Epoch
[2:04:19] Bedreten: @Xaryu A good thing about GDKP are if you are full bis and still pug raids you still get some benefit from raiding
[2:04:19] Saravyn: @Xaryu I got my popcorn lets do Uberdanger pretty please <3
[2:04:21] LilTaisu: Amd gdkps aren't gone they just won't be advertised in chat that is all
[2:04:28] d4m13nGR: @mcnannerpuss yep. people profiting in GDKPs are heavily involved in gold buying even if they don't buy gold themselves
[2:04:29] joonelius3: people who are against gdkp havent ecen fking done it.
[2:04:29] limburgse: Token needs to go too indeed
[2:04:31] Reaperz_kinetic: @DynamerX part of the game sucks to suck better than someone playing everyday just to get outbid by a gold buyer
[2:04:32] donnieg93: rolling on gear is so sick bro wats even better than that ? LC fuck yea bro
[2:04:32] naturalduck: I've seen gdkps require 500g. Like what??
[2:04:34] swolygh0st: REMOVE BOOSTING REMOVE BoE's REMOVE ENCHANTS REMOVE MOUNTS
[2:04:34] Trav_Where: My issue with GDKPs is just that I can't get gear if I'm in game broke. Then I have to do the boring gild grind so that I can get gear. No one wants the broke guy with no gold in their GDKP that is just there to take some gold at the end
[2:04:39] Curtsy: Shareholders would luterally never allow the token to be taken away
[2:04:39] Pixiepantss: yeah that
[2:04:40] Akompliss: Would you play retail then?
[2:04:41] Nonprophetx: no chance they get rid of the token. they have to be making some serious money selling wow tokens lol
[2:04:43] Treenax: GDKP is bis
[2:04:45] Bredmose1: Tokens = Blizzard Profit

[2:04:47] Lunehr: @joonelius3 Well it will stay that way now LUL
[2:04:53] teamHARRELL: No matter what, SOD is supposed to be for new/casual players and GDKP is not casual
[2:04:54] TheDeavs: I've never tried one. I'd rather go with the same crew
[2:04:56] JackLarsen4: oh cool the uberdanger vids will be great
[2:04:56] jackpepsimba: @swolygh0st cringe, false-equivalence, and RMT cope LUL LUL LUL LUL
[2:05:00] StripSniper: yeah
[2:05:01] warmupwarri0r: @Trav_Where Absolutely this! @Xaryu it enables people who have gold to get more gold/blocks people who don't do RMT
[2:05:03] smaftyz: @Nicholas909 thats an issue of phase 1 being way to long tho
[2:05:03] Shakezulah22: if you need gold or gear for "benefit" then jjst dont do it if you're full bis
[2:05:04] daybreak_ttv: most GDKP are honest now begause its better to just buy a run of raid get all loot its 15$
[2:05:05] Zerksyera: then Get rid of gold buying wtf
[2:05:06] Goji_o7: So manage bots so it's harder to farm gold.......?
[2:05:07] DynamerX: @Xaryu imagine i wasfarming 12 hours a day, just to know that whenepic staff drops i canbid as muchas i can, i cant imagine so random alt with green items will win roll against me, thats why it is an L, because now people can go online once per 3 days and win rll against me, while iam playing every day and enjooying every piece of content
[2:05:07] vision42g: @Nicholas909 same made so much gold from gold buyers EZ
[2:05:10] Mestema17: even in theory gdkps are bad.  They promote holding money instead of playing the game.  So then you have people who just farm money or sell boosts to get gold.
[2:05:11] williwhite94: def not LOL
[2:05:12] Treenax: casual players are broke
[2:05:13] Libertas09: definitely not casual
[2:05:13] graziNNN: They are not really casually
[2:05:13] Oscarr944: i was a fan of GDKP until goldbuyers kept joining in on the run and over bid everybody
[2:05:15] TheFamilyAffair: Blizzard should just people common sense & morals so people would feel bad when cheating :P
[2:05:16] WenisPiener: fuck no theyre not
[2:05:16] jazrian: removing wow token just moves ppl to buy money from gold-sellers, which incentivizes them to keep gold farming/botting.  wow token is a necessary evil.
[2:05:17] DibsieRS: tre
[2:05:17] blazzedzz: It's all dirty money weather you buy it or not lop

[2:05:24] taco_soprano: wrath classic ones are doing 11-12hm runs
[2:05:25] watchmeblindx: IN A WAY THE GDKP BRINGS THE GOLD BOUGHT TO YOUR HANDS AND MAKES YOU EVEN MORE GOLD BECAUSE ITS DIRTY AND PEOPLE BIDDING ARE PAYING YOU MROE
[2:05:25] typer___iban: no lmfao gdkp is not trying to be casual
[2:05:26] TheDeavs: Idk, I'm casual. Started WoW with HC release

[2:05:30] polesreport: casual players dont have enough gold for GDKPs
[2:05:31] Drakothius: gdkps not casual imo
[2:05:31] williwhite94: casual players work 40-60 hours a week and want to have fun lol
[2:05:31] HugzGG: @Xaryu yes but the gdkp change hurts the veteran players
[2:05:32] Nungiven: Casual players don't usually have massive amounts of gold
[2:05:32] commoncold7: Gdkp is really nice when you have the gear it gives me a reason to raid
[2:05:32] fakeGrimes: GDKPs are more casual than anything... dont have to play jhust buy gear and gold
[2:05:33] Thejproshow: as a very casual player I have no gold I never get gear
[2:05:33] Ohaitherelol: fuck all u casual boys trying to take over sod
[2:05:33] jimmychanga_: classic is elitist
[2:05:35] KEEL3R: compared to r1 arena, yea classic is mad casual
[2:05:35] d3monlicous19: why should i have to pay for gear drop in a raid i was apart of
[2:05:36] HunterericTV: gdkp is far from casual lol if u want it without gold buying
[2:05:37] veek91twitch: if casuals went to GDKP, the raidbosses wouldn't die.
[2:05:38] huckleson: classic wow is anti casual lmfao
[2:05:38] tmoney9018: having the gold for gdkp isn’t casual
[2:05:38] archetip: gdkps are only casual if you buy gold
[2:05:39] silvapt92: couldnt you form a raid with a max gold bid per item and if that max is reached, both sides could /roll... that way people could join raids with gdkp system but able to choose to go or not based on the level of max bid... sometihng like that
[2:05:40] vision42g: no ppl pump in gdkps
[2:05:40] Soarlozer: sod is literally made for gamer dads

[2:05:45] Thundacles: you think dads are out there in GDKPs?
[2:05:45] smaftyz: you cant get into a gdkp if you dont have 100 dollasr worth of gold
[2:05:46] iPlayCuzFun: im 1 piece from full bis and GDKPs dont ever invite me

[2:05:49] SillyPanda: GDKP's are mostly run by the sweats for the sweats
[2:05:49] enigmasvea: @Xaryu youre forgetting the server lag STV event will cause KEKW -
[2:05:49] brodiebrohan: my dad doesn’t know how to get into raids, much less GDKPs and all the requirements
[2:05:51] ruperttheyeti: you need a bag full of gold or huge mega damage to get in
[2:05:51] jim4201423: Wrath classic gdkps are silly crazy
[2:05:51] Hydro1904: Pugs easy
[2:05:51] Mestema17: casual players don't have money to spend
[2:05:51] GameZain3: Can premade raids charge 100000gold for people to participate still, is that still legal?
[2:05:52] ClinxyWow: gdkp gives you gold so you dont have to farm for hours
[2:05:52] Libertas09: MS > OS is casual, SR is still semi casual
[2:05:52] joestopfarmingshako: They usually don't play casually
[2:05:53] xiClutchBoyix: On that's a bad take, GDKPs are the most casual ever.  You can be the biggest shitter in the world and still go and have fun with no pressure to parse
[2:05:53] myfellowpurgers2: gdkp is casual for the randoms but the host are SUPER sweaty
[2:05:54] zer0_the_legend: No gdkp is absolutely not casual. Casual players either need the gear or they don't have gold to compete with hardcore players @xaryu
[2:05:54] graziNNN: The carries are the sweats, yes
[2:05:54] Teem0time: ya but u have to be a buyer/pumper or u wont get in
[2:05:55] Octane33: @Xaryu what are your overall thoughts on what you would like to see different for P2 - (Excluding GDKP)
[2:05:55] sengip: GDKP makes the casuals buy gold. You log on and you want to raid, and consumes are 100x inflated, so you have to farm or buy gold. @Xaryu
[2:05:55] ninobambinow: No the Ms os players are usually shit and take an hour or two for a 30 min raid
[2:05:55] fanniclap: @Thundacles uh yea
[2:05:56] WenisPiener: they're "casual" in the sense that you can get in, they're not casual in the sense that if you don't buy gold you're not going to get shit for gear
[2:05:56] sargent_baddy: Bro just farm the gold holy shit
[2:05:57] MrDeadDorian: @Xaryu gold sellers and buyers are corruptions of the game not GDKP
[2:05:57] TheSward: @DynamerX on the flip side that's also part of the magic of classic wow for the other party, you play a little and can still get great loot and dopamine when drops happen
[2:05:58] TripHH: Asmon only has a good time because people mail him gold all the time lmao
[2:05:58] elementixxx: gdkp is a way to gear your alts
[2:05:59] sanatalive: gdkp makes it unaccessible because people who play classic all day just have money or are pay to win
[2:05:59] Zerksyera: WRONG, No SWIPING
[2:06:00] seadolphin58: i like buying gold tokens just to buy bigger bags and recipes from ah.. and mogs  from ah
[2:06:01] giantbuckethead: If you have a huge budget it's casual.
[2:06:02] Curtsy: RMTing means right away you are no longer casual @Xaryu
[2:06:02] fakeGrimes: Buy gold buy gear dont play its the most casual
[2:06:02] tetsuaka4: Been playing since 06 and never ran a gdkp ever
[2:06:03] sengip: GDKP makes the casuals buy gold. You log on and you want to raid, and consumes are 100x inflated, so you have to farm or buy gold. @Xaryu  @Xaryu ....
[2:06:03] tomfxs: bfd is the easiest thing in the world and yet  groups are still oversweating it way to hard with requirments
[2:06:04] Puffypuffs: people paying hundreds of gold for a damn item that will get outdated by like lvl 30 OMEGALUL
[2:06:05] Howells_tv: casual players don't get invited to gdkps because they don't have gold and aren't good enough to carry
[2:06:06] voltrix07: am i just an idiot? i didnt even know u can buy gold in wow..how do u do that
[2:06:06] Ryspex: inoiizYES
[2:06:06] Burritosalad: Bro i need gdkps i have 4 children
[2:06:07] drinkingcoldbeer: I dont have to kiss guild officer's asses to get gear
[2:06:07] RDon93: i mean theres still GDKP in wotlk if u want some gold
[2:06:08] Nativityqt: @Xaryu  Wasn't there a Glad mage back in the day that got banned for some gold scam thing back in the day?
[2:06:08] PMA_1: if ur buying gold ur not a casual tho @Xaryu
[2:06:08] warmupwarri0r: @Xaryu you have to swipe if you are a buyer first time
[2:06:09] theGNL: Is that sweatshirt Xar merch? @Xaryu
[2:06:09] rnger: wouldnt we have same issue with gdkps even if gold selling gets removed as long botting to some degree exists? (still having whales coming into the gdkp snagging all the items)
[2:06:09] myfellowpurgers2: the HOST are hardcore about it the players are casual
[2:06:10] Cenarios13: @Zerksyera nice cope OMEGALUL
[2:06:10] sanatalive: yes
[2:06:11] enigmasvea: @Xaryu youre forgetting the server lag STV event will cause KEKW
[2:06:11] sanatalive: wrong
[2:06:12] gary_ontwitch: Yes you're right, GDKP is very casual
[2:06:12] themadfeltcher: swiper no swiping
[2:06:12] Treenax: id say soft res is the most casual
[2:06:13] FezzikGG: assuming not buying gold, not casual
[2:06:14] williwhite94: @Xaryu paying someone for help for a raid is NOT the same as paying for rolls
[2:06:15] xiClutchBoyix: On that's a bad take, GDKPs are the most casual ever. You can be the biggest shitter in the world and still go and have fun with no pressure to parse.
[2:06:15] treyywow: classic wow is the most casual version of wow
[2:06:16] Hakaibrah: you are wrong if the player is not swiping @Xaryu
[2:06:16] Drakothius: most casuals prob dont even raid tbh
[2:06:16] stunn4: just if u buy gold
[2:06:17] ithecon: casuals don’t have gold
[2:06:19] shadowthehedgehog97: @Howells_tv unless u buy gold xd
[2:06:19] Teem0time: how are u gonna join if u have no gold casual player lol
[2:06:20] RoaminIrl: it’s about actually getting into one that makes it not casual. if you are not popular and the average person you get rejected and it is very hard to get in one.
[2:06:20] smaftyz: @Xaryu that implies that the new player bought gold....
[2:06:21] ShikseWTF: yes thats an idiot take tbh
[2:06:21] Libertas09: wrong for sure. MS > OS is casual
[2:06:23] boodramon: stop. you're saying spend money to join a gdkp = casual
[2:06:24] Mico027: Trough sketchy means
[2:06:25] iPlayCuzFun: dont tell him
[2:06:25] OneAndOnlyAron: does no one pug anymore? XD

[2:06:27] polesreport: google "buy gold wow"
[2:06:27] eddymm: you think casuals swipe to get gold?
[2:06:27] graziNNN: @Xaryu casuals aren't buying gold
[2:06:27] Tydus_HW: barely play the game means youre no where near raiding anything
[2:06:27] taylorsdank: you open a ticket to blizzard saying you wanna buy gold
[2:06:28] oPUSHA: You just need to use LFG chat to get into raids. Casuals that barely play dont have the gold to even bid on items in a GDKP..?
[2:06:29] ShooTVeksdee: Gives us a tutorial @Xaryu
[2:06:30] grumpyGGoose: Exactly. Then banning GDKPs = making the game more difficult for casual players
[2:06:31] kirk_hunts: are the carries casuals?

[2:06:37] Boredgeekyt: Wrath has tokens, ya.
[2:06:37] Maniakajoe: Is it safe to sell gold in SOD ?
[2:06:37] Akompliss: Yea
[2:06:39] Astralthundr: even if this particular solution fails, the fact that they are even trying is a W
[2:06:39] rocknsake: yeah it's like 10k gold for a token on wrath
[2:06:41] hooden: U can trade your gold from Retail to SOD and its within the TOS :D
[2:06:42] taco_soprano: $20 for like 10k gold
[2:06:42] Boredgeekyt: But they are not worth it.
[2:06:43] cannlbal: Xaryu prime sub gives gold
[2:06:43] TheMysticBean: Its been in wrath for months

[2:06:45] devianceam: it killed wrath i swear
[2:06:45] myfellowpurgers2: wrath L
[2:06:46] daybreak_ttv: all the lfg adds website now have full H raid carries  armor stack and give you all loot 15$
[2:06:48] joonelius3: @xaryu can we still debunk myth that every gdkp is buying gold. its a minority but those who buy the gols buy a lot of it..
[2:06:50] Curtsy: you can also do golds trades @Xaryu which nobody talks about
[2:06:50] sengip: GDKP makes the casuals buy gold. You log on and you want to raid, and consumes are 100x inflated, so you have to farm or buy gold. @Xaryu
[2:06:51] Fuilund: but without buying gold you will have to farm like crazy in order to actually win the bid for your desired item. so not that casaul
[2:06:52] vision42g: yes u can trade wrath gold for sod
[2:06:53] sanatalive: loll...
[2:06:54] garzzyy: GDKPs are for the sweats that know what they want to min max their gear to the nth degree with loads of gold
[2:06:58] LegendOfKilla: KEKW
[2:07:00] peetca: still watching asmono
[2:07:00] watchmeblindx: BLIZZARD DOESNT WANT YOU BUYING GOLD FROM OTHERS, BUT THEY WANT YOU TO BUY GOLD FROM THE IN A TOKEN LOL
[2:07:00] brodiebrohan: casual players don’t know how to buy gold bro
[2:07:00] sanatalive: you shouldnt have to buy gold to play the game
[2:07:01] Xzanelol: gdkps are gonna turn in peacebloomdkps
[2:07:01] peetca: im out
[2:07:04] sunlitebro: any gifters

[2:07:11] jstuwie: does AG1 give me gold?>?
[2:07:11] ShikseWTF: how is it casual to buy gold for 200 bucks to raid, thats pretty hardcore
[2:07:11] SodaBannedMe: xaryu random greens in wrath were 5k gold before wow token was added. gold has been fucked since BWL classic
[2:07:12] jfachal: how’s is wrath Vanilla when you had TBC and vanilla before that?
[2:07:13] ahfast: now accepting twitch primes
[2:07:13] daigurren2: You can buy a token and trade the gold for sod gold, its 100% allowed so they dont actually care they just want the money as always
[2:07:14] Treenax: in my experience the only people coming to GDKPs are sweaty altoholics

[2:07:19] Mavzerick: !
[2:07:19] ninobambinow: Gdkp players are significantly better. Ms os and softeez casual Andy's are REALLY BAD and make the game not fun for the rest of the players
[2:07:21] Ervill1: prime is free after you pay for them
[2:07:21] stunn4: where is my free prime?
[2:07:22] enigmasvea: @Xaryu youre forgetting the server lag STV event will cause KEKW
[2:07:23] ragergager: thank god gdkp and ppl doing them kinda ruin the game imo
[2:07:23] Turbosoldier: amazon prime isnt

[2:07:26] heyitsken_: might I say I’m proud of myself for fishing the last 2 weeks for my 200 gold?

[2:08:06] warmupwarri0r: they don't know -- most people who are whales/buyers have bought gold (or got gold from main/alt gdkps that they got into from buying gold)
[2:08:07] Cross86: hey just got on. did you go through the Phase 2 stuff already @Xaryu  ?
[2:08:07] socketslol: @xaryu Its a pretty big L as much as I don't necessarily like the gold buying but the system is respected because its more fair than most LC teams and the RNG of /roll! You probably would've rolled against 12 players and probably lost anyways or a Loot Council wouldve just given it to someone else @Xaryu - I have 2000 ppl in my discord server as GDKP host in WotLK and I have like 3-5 whales - the ratio is so small and after like 4-5 GDKPS everyone has 200k+ - if the gold is in the economyalready
[2:08:08] zer0_the_legend: Can anyone explain to me why players pay for boosts to max level and then pay to be carried for gear? Why play the game at all? Lol
[2:08:08] Vesir_1: i don't think there will be server lag for stv event cause its FFA, not going to get enough people to blob

[2:08:17] sengip: GDKP makes the casuals buy gold. You log on and you want to raid, and consumes are 100x inflated, so you have to farm or buy gold. Therefore it makes the casual person decide to either buy gold, or not play. @Xaryu
[2:08:18] gary_ontwitch: The modern "casual" gamer is VERY much programmed at this point to do stuff like buy gold
[2:08:20] Reaperz_kinetic: @socketslol its a massive W
[2:08:21] joonelius3: so annoying like talking to wall.
[2:08:21] Burritosalad: @xaryu bro i have 5 children i need gdkps, i work 95h a week
[2:08:24] PMA_1: use ur twitch prime to get ingame gold
[2:08:26] smaftyz: @williwhite94 except consumes are not inflated, thats the problem. If they were it would be insanely easy to just farm a bunch of gold.
[2:08:27] HotTrophyHusband: I just wanna know how im supposed to make money when botters will still exist making professions almost worthless.... guess ill just sell summons
[2:08:28] ZerfOG: lmao they wont ban streamers buying gold but theyll ban gdkp's
[2:08:29] joshywoshhyy: @xaryu my last gdkp a priest bought arbalest because it was “going for too low”
[2:08:30] itsadam56: @Xaryu next time i get caught buying gold im just saying im a big streamer and those were my viewers sending me stuff /shrug
[2:08:33] Goji_o7: LOL
[2:08:41] TheFamilyAffair: Unfortunately CS2 is infested with cheaters - because there is no real punishment. Same thing applies to WoW with goldbuyers&bots atm.
[2:08:41] Akompliss: Narf mages BTW
[2:08:41] ragergager: only ppl who care that gdkp are banned are streamers and gold buyers

[2:08:47] TheFox0228: The only GDKP I was in years ago was basically 3 no-life gold buyers bidding ten-thousands of gold in an economy of hundreds at the time.
[2:08:47] gogipro: but you will never realistically ''farm'' so much gold
[2:08:48] Impurpletoe: I wonder what banning GDKPs will do to other aspects of the economy for all the people who already farmed or bought gold for P2
[2:08:49] gogipro: never
[2:08:50] zer0_the_legend: Nah boosting for titles and shit is lame. Git gud
[2:08:51] mr__mojo_: so should they regulate the AH too?
[2:08:52] retris9: i got banned 14 days for buying $10 worth
[2:08:54] Johnvanhinten: boosting should also be banned
[2:08:55] BSVMV: i play this alot, like more than i should and shit is so inflated farming gold seems dumb as the bots run the server. so i bought gold to runa GDKP got nothing and gold now sits in my bag rofl WASTE
[2:08:56] warmupwarri0r: @DudeHS_ What happens to the economy if gold is funneled to players from GDKPs from sellers?  There is more of an experience than just "Don't join GDKP"s that GDKPs affect

[2:09:04] Echotamer: GDKPers are gonna revolt and screw the economy up      watch
[2:09:05] spokie: Did you see the screenshot of someone putting up 1.5k gold for the epic staff from BFD lmao
[2:09:08] Howells_tv: gdkps are only good for casual players if they are the ones buying the gold most casual players don't get invited to gdkps because they don't have gold and aren't good/geared enough to carry
[2:09:08] Dash4cash723: People will announce GDKP's on discord and  still make them in P2 right? @Xaryu
[2:09:09] socketslol: @xaryu Its a pretty big L as much as I don't necessarily like the gold buying but the system is respected because its more fair than most LC teams and the RNG of /roll! You probably would've rolled against 12 players and probably lost anyways or a Loot Council wouldve just given it to someone else @Xaryu - I have 2000 ppl in my discord server as GDKP host in WotLK and I have like 3-5 whales - the ratio is so small and after like 4-5 GDKPS everyone has 200k+ - if the gold is in the economyalready
[2:09:11] bakerbaker019: no it doesnt
[2:09:13] watchmeblindx: @REAPERZ_KINETIC IT IS THERE GAME BUT WE ALREADY PAY TO PLAY IT. SO WHAT WE WANT TODO FROM THERE SHOULD BE LEGAL. BUT THEY ARE THE ALL POWERFUL GOVERMENT IN THIS SITUATION
[2:09:14] kallebalik: youre
[2:09:15] Reaperz_kinetic: @retris9 good now you prob wont do it again
[2:09:16] dimestime2: you shot them the VOD ez
[2:09:18] sagouine: well it's still farmed gold
[2:09:18] stunn4: beeing a streamer and accepting gold=buying gold
[2:09:21] tomfxs: watching a streamer take gold like that is so cringe
[2:09:21] sargent_baddy: payo has thousands of gold
[2:09:22] bakedthief333: keep watch on people who receive a over a certain amount of gold per some kind of delay or when people buy a grey item for a "overpriced" item
[2:09:23] Amittyville: imagine simping for a streamer LULW
[2:09:24] SillyPanda: Only big streamers get that much. I'm sure you guys will be ok lol
[2:09:25] yyyy420: they track the sender and then the receiver
[2:09:25] Pixiepantss: Essaying
[2:09:26] bakerbaker019: youre talking about 0.001% of players
[2:09:27] Cross86: Thoughts on phase 2 @Xaryu
[2:09:27] sagouine: it's like onlyfans for nerds right ?
[2:09:27] d4m13nGR: Both are wrong
[2:09:28] Turbosoldier: Just do DKP for real money, not gold
[2:09:29] retris9: @smaftyz most gdkps are spending 100s of dollars
[2:09:33] voltrix07: voltrix07 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 3 months, currently on a 2 month streak! 
[2:09:35] thatdogbitme: define FAIR
[2:09:35] Fuilund: Especially beacaus en most of the steamer gold is most likely bought before they get it
[2:09:36] HelluvaWrecks: thats like saying your gonna get out a speeding ticket by saying your famous. like yeah you might get out of one if you are, but if you're not its obvious
[2:09:38] Treenax: i feel like ur missing a lot of these peoples points when u read them out loud, a lot of the things you are saying are not exclusive with eachother
[2:09:38] roztoky: Maybe detect a traded amount? Like money laundry system?
[2:09:40] DynamerX: @Xaryu imagine i wasfarming 12 hours a day, just to know that whenepic staff drops i canbid as muchas i can, i cant imagine so random alt with green items will win roll against me, thats why it is an L, because now people can go online once per 3 days and win rll against me, while iam playing every day and enjooying every piece of content
[2:09:41] smaftyz: @retris9 any amount should be bannable
[2:09:48] naturalduck: The best you can do is ban in-game advertisment of GDKPs. Seems good enough for me.
[2:09:50] Burritosalad: I have 15 children i cant raid everyday i need gdkps
[2:09:51] Curtsy: @Xaryu every single piece of copper in the game has an ID and they can track it from the original RMT account, this has been a thing in mmorpgs for 20+ years
[2:09:54] Reaperz_kinetic: @watchmeblindx no because when you payed to play you also agreed to the TOS and gold buying is illegal in the TOS.. so youre already wrong again
[2:10:00] Turbosoldier: I would rather get paid real $ to raid other than gold... should do a real money DKP
[2:10:04] GameZain3: GGG in PoE are very strict on donations between audience and streamer, Blizzard could manage the same thing?
[2:10:09] vincent13014: !drops
[2:10:09] StreamElements: Xaryu has enabled Drops for the community! Watch and claim the reward. Check your progress here: https://www.twitch.tv/drops/inventory
[2:10:11] polesreport: sockets is naive if he doesnt believe the majoirty of that gold hasnt been bought
[2:10:12] rPhase: @xaryu we’ll have to test the system by giving xar lots of gold
[2:10:12] Spikeqc: guzuBusiness
[2:10:12] Goji_o7: If the issue stems from BUYING GOLD.... Focus on the BOTS not real players just playing
[2:10:13] chrisrev: i bought over 1000 sod gold and nothing ever happened to me. but at least my characters are geared for P2
[2:10:14] Howells_tv: gdkps are only good for casual players if they are the ones buying the gold most casual players don't get invited to gdkps because they don't have gold and aren't good/geared enough to carry 󠀀
[2:10:14] Cenarios13: @DynamerX learn to socialize and join a guild lol
[2:10:20] HotTrophyHusband: inflation always happens in classic unless they get rid of boosting
[2:10:22] MrPapadorgio: GDKP would be perfect if there was no gold buying, but since gold buying is a thing, it just inflates the market
[2:10:23] warmupwarri0r: @socketslol The whales buy gold -- then transfer the gold to others, it's a broken experience for everyone else. Just stop trying to defend your "RMT" laundering to yourself.
[2:10:25] macjcool: no shot
[2:10:27] mr__mojo_: any game with an in game currency by nature will promote gold buying/selling
[2:10:28] Curtsy: SWG did that back in the day
[2:10:29] ralphyyx3: sounds like cap to me
[2:10:31] StreamElements: Catch stream highlights at -> https://youtube.com/@xaryu & https://youtube.com/@xaryuclips
[2:10:33] jacksunson: defeatism is a big problem
[2:10:34] ithecon: @gojio7 This is one way to focus on the bots
[2:10:34] yellowbrownandred: Buying gold isn't a choice when the prices on everything are hiked up and bots are rampant making the gold dirt cheap. Imagine actually legitimately trying to farm all this gold whilst having a real life on top of it. Bots are the real problem, who cares about a by product like gdkps
[2:10:34] vepsee: pugs are gonna be even worse now to pug, cant wait to play an alt and lose a roll to a keyboard turner
[2:10:35] seadolphin58: can you take that other persons face off here
[2:10:35] Zerksyera: inflation works both ways, can make gold easilly by farming. stop the gold Buying
[2:10:36] 3le_MentaL: It's fine, all the bots will now move to farm mats for consums, ruin the market even more, and then people will realize it was not GDKP, but bots and gold buyers/sellers.
[2:10:36] legallydanm: legallydanm subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 4 months! 
[2:10:37] sengip: GDKP makes the casuals buy gold. You log on and you want to raid, and consumes are 100x inflated, so you have to farm or buy gold. Therefore it makes the casual person decide to either buy gold, or not play. @Xaryu
[2:10:38] bbhank1: LUL
[2:10:39] bodenlosetasche: @Xaryu what do you think about the new mage runes? :)
[2:10:39] watchmeblindx: @REAPERZ_KINETIC BUT BLIZZ WAS NEVER SELLING GOLD AT FIRST AND THEY DIDNT BAN IT TILL THEY SAW OTHERS MAKING MONEY FROM IT. IT WAS THE CHINESE IDEA TO SELL THE GOLD FOR REAL CASH..
[2:10:40] Seoken1: xarNerdge xarNerdge
[2:10:41] LegendOfKilla: Kappa
[2:10:42] TheSward: @DynamerX classic wow is fun because you can get gear for your chars regardless of how much time you spend within the game
[2:10:42] stunn4: @DynamerX how much gold u make in 12h a day? less then 1$ worth of bought gold? xD
[2:10:43] sagouine: sending gold to streamer is totally legit imo
[2:10:43] okChrisk: NFT gold Pog
[2:10:45] Pr0xy_gg: i cud randomly give someone 5k gold then report them for gold buying
[2:10:45] myrolances: The majority of Crusader Strike GDKPS are run through discords that already have workarounds for this, this is only going to kill the random trade gdkps
[2:10:47] OPlNEL13: When GDKP become 80% of the raid anounces in the world chat it becomes a problem
[2:10:49] thatdogbitme: its useful for people who don't want to wait for loot drops, which is ok but that has nothing to do with "fair". Gold buying breaks any defense of a fair gdpk system
[2:10:52] Howells_tv: gdkps are only good for casual players if they are the ones buying the gold most casual players don't get invited to gdkps because they don't have gold and aren't good/geared enough to carry
[2:10:53] TheFamilyAffair: I got declined from a GDKP because I only had 50gold. How ridiculous is that
[2:10:56] vincent13014: is drop end ?
[2:10:58] hooden: I think ppl will just use a different currency then Gold, For example cloth or flowers
[2:10:59] swolygh0st: @xaryu REMOVE BOOSTING , MOUNTS, BoE's
[2:11:01] Burritosalad: I have my 17 children farming gold for the gdkps they cant do this to me man
[2:11:03] Reaperz_kinetic: @watchmeblindx also wrong... RMT has been against the TOS since the start
[2:11:07] Genghjs: I love the GDKP tears <3 <3 <3
[2:11:10] warmupwarri0r: @TheFamilyAffair this is the way, you gotta swipe your card man
[2:11:10] Wash_hc: I will mizs gdkps onmy alt for sod
[2:11:12] Akompliss: That's the US Immigration policy lmao
[2:11:12] Curtsy: well gdkps have min buyouts and theyre not 50 gold so
[2:11:13] OllyWombat: @Xaryu they should just give everyone a stimmy and see what happens....kinda like the wotlk disease prepatch...
[2:11:15] ithecon: @yellowbrownandred YIKES. gold buyer spotted. I’ve got 5 g to my name for the entire phase. now I’m full BiS
[2:11:15] graziNNN: better go buy some gold then, 50 aint shit
[2:11:16] northern__soul: @thefamilyaffair I did as well
[2:11:17] SodaBannedMe: @myrolances yes and no, blizzard is known for popping discords doing stuff against policy
[2:11:19] Daphud: where does the gold even come from? just bots vendering stuff right?
[2:11:19] huckleson: @TheFamilyAffair 50 gold is nothing even if you dont buy gold lmfaooo
[2:11:20] oneshottattertot: kinda their fault for letting bots run loose since the game came to life
[2:11:20] savagelo256: GDKPs being banned is the best thing wow has done
[2:11:21] Turbosoldier: Credit Card DKP new meta
[2:11:24] brie_feusang: Ok but are peacebloom GDKPs banned too?  kappa
[2:11:26] Hellacat: 50g budget is average, v common
[2:11:29] brie_feusang: FUCK
[2:11:31] FezzikGG: half the groups ask for budget LUL
[2:11:31] sumdumphuk: Dude gdkps have been around for 15+ years
[2:11:34] Treenax: lol@50g budget
[2:11:35] sqwinchers: Morning xar hows your week so far
[2:11:36] Howells_tv: gdkps are only good for casual players if they are the ones buying the gold most casual players don't get invited to gdkps because they don't have gold and aren't good/geared enough to carry 󠀀
[2:11:37] PuppetInsane: after long years of thinking about the 'bot issue' on games like wow, i've come to realize they don't want them fully gone because they still give some profit for the games and making sure they are all banned/don't comeback would cost them money. it's all about money xD
[2:11:38] Nicholas909: nobody makes gold if there are no buyers tho
[2:11:39] savagelo256: GDKPs are so cringe
[2:11:40] HotTrophyHusband: i got my gold naturally and joined a gdkp where nobody had more than 50 gold. got so much gear cuz i came with 200
[2:11:40] ruperttheyeti: hence why they arent casual anymore
[2:11:40] Coin_: people defending gdkp's in current state are being purposely obtuse. Pretty obvious how it creates inflation and ruins the economy for regular players
[2:11:41] swolygh0st: @xaryu REMOVE BOOSTING , MOUNTS, BOE'S
[2:11:42] smaftyz: @TheFamilyAffair imagine not spending 100 dollasr to get items you could get for free. How dare you.
[2:11:44] huckleson: HOMIE SAID HE HAD A 50G BUDGET LOLLLLLL
[2:11:44] mortmos: @Xaryu you are so out of touch with reality its shocking
[2:11:45] thehorrorblygreatshow: GDKP is ass in this game. Plain and simple
[2:11:45] zephyshomm: gdkps are good if you dont wanna lose your last 1-2 items to a green person who just dinged 10min ago
[2:11:46] Akompliss: GDKPs were invented by Korean gold buyers...
[2:11:49] RageTry: u sign up for gdkp as buyer or carry most of the tome
[2:11:50] wookinit: people are advertising 2-300+gold and still not getting in one
[2:11:50] Franak: its goddamn communism :D
[2:11:50] ImSo1337: I ran many GDKPs on WOtlk. Now i only run MS/OS or LC. But all the gold now funds my monthly billing haha
[2:11:54] zer0_the_legend: There's always gonna be elitists. Bunch nerddsss
[2:11:56] levitucuss: whoever said that currency has an id code.. sounds like a COP
[2:11:58] vision42g: @thehorrorblygreatshow WHY
[2:12:00] notso9oodgamer: not to mention 5k tanking fees
[2:12:00] Ananaass__: @xaryu please help me understand this. i play quite a bit, have never done a gdkp, but the fact that they’re in the game hasn’t impacted it, why are people so adamant about it? how does it change your gaming experience if you just don’t participate in them?
[2:12:01] Joxtirol: i geting sick when i imagen how many button i need to keep in mind in next phase
[2:12:01] poltergeist_inc: poltergeist_inc subscribed with Prime. 
[2:12:02] JihnFei: people defending 2024 gdkps LUL fk outta here
[2:12:03] Mavzerick: Casual gamers are just all on mobile now.
[2:12:03] watchmeblindx: @REAPERZ_KINETIC JUST BS THEY SHOULD SELL THERE GOLD AND LET OTHERS SELL THERE GOLD IN THE GAME. THIS WOULD BRING MORE MONEY TO THE PEOPLE AND HELP THEM IN IRL
[2:12:04] poltergeist_inc: I agree with you 100%. Example: I play classic era, I went to some gdkps, there were players who spent over 1 million gold in one run.. that's far from any reality.. so we created a guild and cleared everything from MC to NAXX, and this in 2023, just real classic vibes
[2:12:05] TiPauloDnD: @PuppetInsane it cost them money to ban not the other way around
[2:12:05] limed_: GDKP copers
[2:12:06] thatdogbitme: no non-gold buyer is invited to any gdpk running today. There is no redeeming value to them as they currently exist
[2:12:06] taylorsdank: us casuals just stay out of the convo
[2:12:06] macjcool: remove gold, make it all a merit based system
[2:12:06] Curtsy: I am 100% convicned the people actually mad about this are mad because they're going to take a hit on their RMT income
[2:12:07] Akompliss: Remove Mage AOE farming
[2:12:09] SarcasticApe: Pepega
[2:12:11] Mico027: Nobody buy golds for mounts and boe OMEGALUL
[2:12:11] Seoken1: true
[2:12:12] lurker_0o: yea
[2:12:12] Treenax: no currency has an ingame code, that person is trippin
[2:12:14] gghostrobos: just play the game like how its intended that's it all you have to do
[2:12:15] jaredfrasas93: Aren't people just gonna buy boosts?
[2:12:15] mr__mojo_: that’s the exact argument, people buy gold for everything in this game
[2:12:17] socketslol: @Xaryu The problem is you cant just remove GDKP if GDKP's and botting has already started. Too much gold in the economy.  If you could remove the gold that came from bots than you'd have a good system. At my GDKP Host Cuts and amount of runs in ToGC it would be 500k/year if it was all sold via websites
[2:12:19] Willcaughron: boosting is not cheating
[2:12:19] bananian21: zg tiger on era is selling for 250k
[2:12:20] thehorrorblygreatshow: Smooth brain take
[2:12:20] Darksyde1029: @huckleson 50 gold in P1 is probably a decent amount compared to the average net worth. Your idea of gold is inflated by the GDKP crowd but the average casual player probably has about 50g or maybe even less.
[2:12:23] dylan_blowie: I just got here. Did he react to uberdanger already today?
[2:12:27] vilness: Lets be real /roll and loot council is also bad system, There always be people that get dissapointed
[2:12:27] Jessrabbit1: black market auction house is one thing people buy gold for in retail
[2:12:28] sargent_baddy: make mount a rep grind
[2:12:30] sansawow: epic mount should be questchain, not gold only
[2:12:31] JihnFei: let the rmt gdkpers expose themselves. buncha morons.
[2:12:31] Treenax: 50g is nothing
[2:12:31] lampsterof79: Peacebloom up over 2000% since yesterday.  Not lying.  Go check it out/
[2:12:32] Jack_kgbeast: remove AH and social too then
[2:12:32] Ironchin420: OMG DE RARE! OMG, GUYS!! SAVIX, NEED BACKUP RIGHTNOW!
[2:12:33] warmupwarri0r: @Curtsy 100%. The guy who keeps spamming defending his 2k person GDKP server is malding because he is going to lose out on gold.
[2:12:35] Genghjs: GDKP = P2W
[2:12:35] Burritosalad: Remove trading, force everyone to play ssf hc
[2:12:36] Willcaughron: go make a dang mage
[2:12:38] huckleson: @Darksyde1029 my friends that farm gold/profs have like 500g so???
[2:12:39] StandardOut: It creates economics focused on broken practices and greed. Thats it
[2:12:40] wookinit: no ones buying gold for a mount wtf
[2:12:41] targon_innos: or just ban anyone for buying gold longer than 3 days EleGiggle @Xaryu
[2:12:42] numblezzz: thats a bad faith argument. there is a direct correlation between massive gold buying and gdkps
[2:12:42] macjcool: @dylan_blowie no we are too busy arguing about gold
[2:12:43] Pr0xy_gg: "Whats ur budget?"
[2:12:45] ZerfOG: when ive bought gold its for professions or some grind i just dont want to do
[2:12:45] capt_allberries: gdkps should just be structured like survivor actions. everyone can spend the same amount, cap the gold per person
[2:12:46] TheFox0228: @TnAKnSpnAK no code but they technically have a "transaction" tracker for trades they can look at the amount of currency exchanged
[2:12:48] jvanstry: the only reason i buy gold is for mounts
[2:12:48] brie_feusang: Holy shit chat is malding so hard lmfao
[2:12:49] savagelo256: who’s coping saying ppl buy gold for mounts and consumes lmfaooooooo
[2:12:50] Cross86: asmondgold looks like his concentrating on whistling LUL
[2:12:51] daigurren2: People are wild with the absolute misinformation they are spreading in this chat just to seem smart.
[2:12:51] ZerfOG: not for gear
[2:12:52] Coin_: mounts have a flat cost, so there's not going to be inflation past that point. BoE's aren't the best gear in the game so the value has an upper limit
[2:12:52] LueDawg: People will probably write a discord bot to do bids for gdkp
[2:12:52] dr_g_ttv: They should also remove the auction house and restrict all trading. Just make the whole game SSF
[2:12:53] Reaperz_kinetic: @watchmeblindx they can get a real job and not ruin the game for others then... its blizzards game you agreed to the TOS when you started playing and gold buying has been against TOS since the start... tough luck
[2:12:56] gary_ontwitch: Sure if you just ignore the order of magnitude difference in scale...
[2:12:57] capt_allberries: auctions *
[2:13:00] Tydus_HW: it’s a competing bidding so the numbers get real crazy real quick
[2:13:05] Mico027: 50g for a mount versus 2000g for a raid gear
[2:13:08] Spikeqc: naxx out? ok
[2:13:09] socketslol: @Xaryu The problem is you cant just remove GDKP if GDKP's and botting has already started. Too much gold in the economy. If you could remove the gold that came from bots than you'd have a good system. At my GDKP Host Cuts and amount of runs in ToGC it would be 500k/year if it was all sold via websites - this is with 20 runs per week - its almost like another form of Botting without beeing the bot itself.
[2:13:09] smaftyz: @huckleson which will slowly turn into something you can buy for 20 bucks as inflation goes on
[2:13:12] FelQueen: you mean casual players, are they millionaires? They cant spend money on gold the whole life, people want live life
[2:13:13] impa1nful: gdkps aneed to be banned in classic too
[2:13:15] rnger: is even the goldbuying main problem? imo its the bots who make all this extra gold on massive scale that is the issue
[2:13:15] Ananaass__: @xaryu please help me understand this. i play quite a bit, have never done a gdkp, but the fact that they’re in the game hasn’t impacted it, why are people so adamant about it? how does it change your gaming experience if you just don’t participate in them?
[2:13:17] DonSilvers: ficistious?
[2:13:18] dr_g_ttv: they should just eliminate gold from the game
[2:13:19] PuppetInsane: @TiPauloDnD that's what i sayed, maybe u missunderstood
[2:13:20] Darksyde1029: @huckleson And they aren't casual or average. Again your perception is skewed by the players you surround yourself with. Having 500g in P1 is probably top 1-5% wealth if I had to guess.
[2:13:21] watchmeblindx: @REAPERZ_KINTIC PEOPLE GOT TO FEED THEMSELVES AND THERE FAMILY. BLIZZARD COULD HELP PEOPLE BY LETTING OTHERS SELL THERE DIGITAL CURRECNY AND BLIZZARD COULD TAKE A PERCENATGE FOR THE SELL ;) THEY COULD TEAM UP WITH THEM AND HELP THE WORLD
[2:13:26] koctopus: The difference is a mount is a fixed cost, and GDKP scales based off the amount of gold brought. ala like your story about the weapon from naxx
[2:13:28] karrots96: just tuned in. what stops GDKPers from using another currency like “pearls” to run GDKPs? how are they enforcing the ban?
[2:13:28] Nativityqt: Everyone's "argument" is "well my experience is..." and not looking at the actual problem
[2:13:29] Curtsy: Not an argument
[2:13:30] sargent_baddy: @Mico027 whos spending 2000g on gear? you got ripped bro
[2:13:31] Zerksyera: BLIZZARD avaoiding the real issue once again
[2:13:32] Goji_o7: Gdkps don't magically create gold... It only recirculates what players have
[2:13:38] DonSilvers: aah fictitious
[2:13:44] brie_feusang: The crypto dork who types in all caps is making me die laughing
[2:13:45] numblezzz: you wont be able to fully stop it, but you can disincentivize it - most people dont wanna risk their accounts doing something ToS
[2:13:45] bpwryl: @xaryu Do you really think blizzard is doing enough to combat gold buying? It seems to me it wouldn’t be rocket science to flag accounts that spends 100% time farming gold and then sending away that gold for nothing in exchange in-game
[2:13:46] warmupwarri0r: @socketslol exactly, stop doing it and contributing to RMT
[2:13:47] zer0_the_legend: @willcaughron sure it is. You're not playing the game as intended. It's the same as cheating to have infinite health so you can complete content you couldn't otherwise get
[2:13:48] seadolphin58: i like to buy mounts too and battle pets... so buying a  a goin for gold helps
[2:13:54] ellgthompson: how will I get PoD on my 2h enhance sham without buying gold :(
[2:13:55] Reaperz_kinetic: @watchmeblindx if they wanna feed their family they can get actual jobs that dont ruin the game for others just trying to enjoy themselves....
[2:13:56] Curtsy: People bitch if blizzard does nothing and people bitch if they do OMEGALUL
[2:13:56] sengip: GDKP makes the casuals buy gold. You log on and you want to raid, and consumes are 100x inflated, so you have to farm or buy gold. Therefore it makes the casual person decide to either buy gold, or not play. @Xaryu
[2:13:57] AceOfFlame: @GojiO7 bought gold that is popular among gdkp's.....is not circulating
[2:13:58] grantgatz: CAN WE MOVE ON PLS
[2:14:01] grantgatz: BEEN AN HOUR ON THIS
[2:14:04] TMMOOF: I have a friend who's bought over 2k gold just for deathrolling... it goes beyond gear
[2:14:04] savagelo256: the fact people are doing raid lead cuts for a 10man nerfed raid is just wild lmao
[2:14:07] shadowthehedgehog97: obviously blizzard is having trouble banning bots and gold buyers. so targeting the reasons for buying gold might be more lucrative
[2:14:07] ithecon: @gojio7 HAVE YOU WATCHED THE VIDEO!? How can you be so naive!?
[2:14:07] graziNNN: L
[2:14:07] huckleson: @Xaryu why dont they just make gold super abundant and easy to make???? That is the only way to actually stop gold buying. People buy gold because they dont want to spend hours farming it DUH
[2:14:08] Treenax: sounds like the actual problem is inflation concern
[2:14:09] Mico027: @Mico027 I was just exagerating a bit but clearly you need much more gold for GDKP compared to anything else
[2:14:11] polesreport: yes
[2:14:12] KemmeP: !drops
[2:14:12] heyitsken_: got chatting moving today with this convo!
[2:14:12] StreamElements: Xaryu has enabled Drops for the community! Watch and claim the reward. Check your progress here: https://www.twitch.tv/drops/inventory
[2:14:12] Ananaass__: @xaryu please help me understand this. i play quite a bit, have never done a gdkp, but the fact that they’re in the game hasn’t impacted it, why are people so adamant about it? how does it change your gaming experience if you just don’t participate in them?
[2:14:12] Porkypine666: its not too late... were level 25 lmao
[2:14:13] Deathnote_Light: what about the bots they have feelings too Sadge
[2:14:13] Zerksyera: NO
[2:14:13] 4PK20: @Xaryu react to my hc death - skull rock 8/8 BWL guild - i was the GM - https://www.twitch.tv/4pk20/clip/FreezingPlumpClintPMSTwin-Qrt1xWNSNi9J_YHa
[2:14:13] nFeel: do we have any news on the new HC mode
[2:14:13] smaftyz: @warmupwarri0r phase 1 gold is pointless. We are level 25. Its not too late
[2:14:13] LueDawg: Bots/gold sellers are really the only thing causing inflation
[2:14:14] Jpublico4: ya
[2:14:15] Treenax: never
[2:14:15] macjcool: yes
[2:14:15] CHICKENARMSANDLEGS: could hire GM bot kickers
[2:14:16] bakedthief333: yes sir
[2:14:16] revanthyr: yessir
[2:14:16] Spikeqc: no ok
[2:14:16] sengip: No
[2:14:16] TB8008: Yes
[2:14:17] FullySuited: indeed
[2:14:18] hclark0: please
[2:14:18] clickadicka: no
[2:14:18] FelQueen: @Xaryu  I would remove streamers who receive gold and items for free

[2:14:20] TheFox0228: yeah, kinda just a lot of the same thigns being said now lol
[2:14:21] Dochunk: YES! We're tired of it now lol
[2:14:22] lanaklana: i see the black lotus raids right before my eyes Xaryu
[2:14:23] SlapdickWoWplayer: just want some enshrouded
[2:14:23] bongwaterfacewash: cheating KP
[2:14:24] Zerksyera: HAVE A POLL,
[2:14:26] Reaperz_kinetic: @watchmeblindx also most gold sellers make WAY more than enough to feed their families so another bad argument
[2:14:28] DonSilvers: u did good, fuck that chatter
[2:14:32] numblezzz: blizzard simultaneously needs to punish buyers more. like they didnt even give soda a 1 day ban, just slap on wrist
[2:14:35] SpecialAgent_FeelsDankMan: FUCK OFF gold buyers im so happy they removed gdkp LULW
[2:14:39] amadeusthespirit: There is also professions to make gold with.
[2:14:40] Genghjs: GDKP made me buy gold back in classic eea
[2:14:40] huckleson: @Xaryu why dont they just make gold super abundant and easy to make???? That is the only way to actually stop gold buying. People buy gold because they dont want to spend hours farming it
[2:14:41] Goji_o7: @ithecon it's common sense. If it incentives botting... just resolve botting
[2:14:41] bakedthief333: was great
[2:14:41] 4PK20: @Xaryu react to my hc death - skull rock 8/8 BWL guild - i was the GM - https://www.twitch.tv/4pk20/clip/FreezingPlumpClintPMSTwin-Qrt1xWNSNi9J_YHa  PLZ
[2:14:45] drjabbar: I did gdkp twice in sod and no one seeemed to have a suspicious amount of money, it was fun
[2:14:45] skwumberton: you are a verbal processor
[2:14:46] TurdBurgison: bye bye gdkp nerds
[2:14:49] Karpaa: @Xaryu why not just personal loot and ingame AH wuold be fixed price. Trades disabled. so gold wuold matter anymore
[2:14:50] ithecon: @dudehs_ yes.
[2:14:50] PoisonRocket: FKP is the real way to go
[2:14:51] socketslol: If you were doing 500k/year hosting GDKP's you'd have a different viewpoint on the situation - the community built in the GDKP is sometimes greater since its less limited to a guild and open to an entire discord community @Xaryu
[2:14:54] OllyWombat: @Xaryu how often do you clear your youtube notifications?
[2:14:54] Zerksyera: POLL ARE WE READY TO MOVE ON FROMTHIS DISCUSSION
[2:14:57] grizzlyhead: Uber danger now pls
[2:14:58] sagouine: yeah i agree confronting even your ideas to other to see if they see it another way
[2:14:58] savagelo256: GDKP mains down bad love to see it
[2:14:59] Curtsy: Chatter actually making an argument that RMTers won;t be able to feed their families now KEKW
[2:15:00] LostPirate13: The real issue about removing GDKP it is handy for someone who has a job and kids to raid with a group on a semi regular basis. Yes you have gold buying, will gdkp removal actually fix any problems?
[2:15:00] smaftyz: @SpecialAgent_FeelsDankMan most people are. The ones that aren't are the people you hope will quit the game anyways lmao
[2:15:05] jargly: i wanna hear ahmpys thoughts on it
[2:15:06] Treenax: @socketslol lol ya that dude is a liar
[2:15:07] StandardOut: They need to have a GDKP server....
[2:15:07] 5haun: are
[2:15:08] ZerfOG: lol they will all just buy an item and use it as currency
[2:15:08] vepsee: people get way into their feels lmfao
[2:15:13] Turbosoldier: I will still buy gold unfortunately
[2:15:13] 4PK20: @Xaryu react to my hc death - skull rock 8/8 BWL guild - i was the GM - https://www.twitch.tv/4pk20/clip/FreezingPlumpClintPMSTwin-Qrt1xWNSNi9J_YHa plzzzz xarbar
[2:15:13] JihnFei: @4PK20 holy shit you are bad. why do you not know where any of your buttons are
[2:15:14] huckleson: @Xaryu why dont they just make gold super abundant and easy to make???? That is the only way to actually stop gold buying. People buy gold because they dont want to spend hours farming
[2:15:14] raymondjj420: Can we get a classic wow token that solves alot of gold buying issues
[2:15:15] smaftyz: @jargly lmao that guy is so weird
[2:15:17] joonelius3: I really hate the fact that people hate gdkp without even trying them.
[2:15:18] Boruox: PREACH!
[2:15:18] ithecon: @huckleson INFLATION
[2:15:19] SpiritGun_: Dark and Darker when tho
[2:15:19] 4PK20: @JihnFei bro ik
[2:15:22] aelimas: 3
[2:15:22] vepsee: broke players hate gdkps : (
[2:15:23] NobodyNeverLucky: They could just start fresh servers where gdkp's are not allowed, easy solution and I know many that would come back for that
[2:15:24] Boruox: play it
[2:15:24] Genghjs: Play it

[2:15:29] ZerfOG: gonna be joing free action pots dkp's
[2:15:30] sticksaredrifting: click baited by pic
[2:15:31] myrolances: Unironically noone I know who runs GDKPS is worried about being banned from this, everyone is just gonna use workarounds
[2:15:33] Genghjs: Tyyy
[2:15:34] Nicholas909: removing GDKP will never get rid of gold buying but it does get rid of a big piece of content for a lot of people
[2:15:35] macjcool: please god no
[2:15:36] brie_feusang: Using asmongold for click bait KEKW
[2:15:37] macjcool: turn it off
[2:15:39] huckleson: @ithecon but that literally happens anyway and the only people that suffer are the people that actually farm gold
[2:15:41] garzzyy: i love the convo, don't let chat stop you if you are vibin big xar
[2:15:41] smaftyz: @joonelius3 hard to try it when they ask you to haev 100 dollars worth of gold to be allowed to join
[2:15:42] eflainel: @EleriusTV nah
[2:15:42] rns_aurelius: @BullzeyeWoW yeah theyre on wowhead

[2:16:03] 4PK20: @P45HKO 2 day wow bender was not thinking straight
[2:16:11] Arkylz: I don't understand how someone thinks gdkps could be good for the economy
[2:16:14] smaftyz: @huckleson no one cares mate xD
[2:16:15] taylorsdank: chair react streamer
[2:16:19] ithecon: @huckleson more gold = higher prices. look up inflation and you might understand.
[2:16:22] myrolances: @savagelo256 I mean its not really  cope, probably 80% of crusader strike gdkps are run through discords who already have workarounds for the changes
[2:16:22] Genghjs: Family unfriendly stream
[2:16:23] kotz98: asmongold looks like a bum

[2:48:43] Zocoe: there is a full run down on how to beat the game. its over done. there is no trial and error
[2:48:44] kirk_hunts: It was data mined but this boss was in such a weird place in SSC and SSC was so big and it wasn't obvious that a boss spawned there until someone decided to fish in that spot

[3:04:31] thebigpero123: @jiggyspice yea he was a goat. the MT / guild leader of eternal reign was like 8 in world on my server or something. 14 year old me would be amazed lol

[3:06:58] stekkermane: @TheMysticBean exactly lol, like blizz is gonna check private discord groups
[3:07:19] TheMysticBean: @stekkermane People are clueless if they think they can actually ban GDKPS
[3:07:23] Xrantin: @themysticbean because with that many people in a raid, there will 9 times out of 10 be a slip up or something obviously showing it is a gdkp. there are many ways even outside of logs. just accept the fact they can and will ban you and stop arguing over it lol
[3:07:31] dizzypeezy: yeah they would need to ban trading gold if they wanna ban gdkp discord

[3:10:04] jiggyspice: @thebigpero123 it was very enjoyable. back then people were patient. We would spend weeks and months clearing raids. and it was such a great feeling to finally clear a boss we had been stuck on for months
