[1:25:54] ekdiss79: Primal Chaos and Artisan's Mettle could both be account bound so you can shift them between toons as needed
[1:26:10] Talason: towelliee how do you remind all your bindings for all your alts

[1:26:53] Windydish: @Towelliee did blizz release a new game engine yesterday? game feels different...
[1:26:58] NBK_Sethus: the biggest gearing issue across the entire game is that you're basically limited to 1 upgrade per week with the vault, unless you get very lucky with rolls
[1:28:29] mavericks312: @dreamwalker213 i mean your not wrong in the sense that all guilds have different loot ideas like some have a priority system, i just feel like we only hear about horrible looting in lfr

[1:46:59] faulen: is it worth though? YOu will be Chaos starved when you need to craft the 16s
[1:47:15] raldrik: this feels so bad that you spend your first minute on a boat
[1:47:57] soge131: I think the point was that forging and reforging should be so expensive that once you can farm 16 you'd rather craft 418 than 405 and then recraft them, but I agree it'd be nice to at least have the choice

[3:02:30] Jarlan23: i fucking love turn-based games though theyre easily my favorite genre
[3:02:35] Pallyofhell: @Jarlan23 i think they're gonna play off a plot point in mass effect story

[3:15:40] its_hekks: 6%
[3:17:21] Troniin: get it wrong on purpose once so the RP is shorter

[3:19:02] NerdyTeK: likea auto skip or sumthin
[3:19:11] Lerross: Spitting facts
[3:19:14] abracka_: a lot of the timers need 2-4 minutes added on them and the RP needs removed. HoV is the worst offender of it
[3:19:17] Teknofear64: yOU'RE EXACTLY RIGHT!

[3:19:22] kassafras: There’s supposedly a way to skip the boats. I’ve never tried it myself.
[3:19:24] Teknofear64: oops caps
[3:19:29] Pallyofhell: didnt they adjust the timers for dungeons that have rp
[3:19:35] darthhelmett: spittin facts @Towelliee
[3:19:43] thatguynamedjans: Yeah its frustrating, but I think they already account for the RP when making the timer, so if they removed it they would just shorten the timer
[3:19:44] tronbadgames: what if theyve already adjusted timers for the rp?
[3:19:45] biirrd: the time is calculaded in the timer
[3:19:49] biirrd: rp
[3:19:51] dreamZ111: ov rp is like watching short tv series episode
[3:19:55] im_capy: it just takes the momentum outta the run
[3:19:58] xo_navi: LUL
[3:20:12] thatguynamedjans: Id prefer they shorten the tmer and remove the RP personally
[3:20:17] xo_navi: every pug i have to do the entire rp
[3:20:17] Pallyofhell: you can water walk to skip the boat thats about it
[3:20:22] Uglyfoot: Or they added the extra 1-2 minutes to the timer...
[3:20:27] taylorsdank: They set timers based on the encounters, so just time it correctly and you're good
[3:20:31] tdpark_: the RP can be longer if you do the achievement , lol
[3:20:33] Uglyfoot: still annoying though
[3:20:43] thatguynamedjans: With CoS it is an odd thing though, because you can shorten the timer by removing more of the pilars and deacivating them. So in that dungeon RP is almost a mechanic
[3:20:47] Dempsterr: surely they have included the RP time in the timer and would take away the RP time from timer if removing the RP
[3:21:09] tronbadgames: @Towelliee be even cooler, if they just stopped putting CoS in the pool haha
[3:21:15] im_capy: yay, 20th time running it....lets watch the RP again and again and again and again and again and again....
[3:21:27] xo_navi: very clean baits
[3:21:36] thatguynamedjans: I think Im in the minority that really like CoS lol
[3:21:54] Athaeln: Well the RP is probably taken into account for the 30min timer
[3:21:55] Pallyofhell: the rogue is the tank Kappa
[3:21:59] WoW_StandalonE: nah,  pereadin said you all kinda sucked this run LULW
[3:22:09] abracka_: LOL they're trolling you at this point

[3:31:16] REDSUNDERGROUND: i mean weve already unlocked it at tyrs hold...
[3:31:22] Slapboxh: 2 more weeks until catalyst right
[3:31:23] DonPapitasChip: how much ilvl do you consider to be enough to that run
[3:31:33] Snabido: I wonder, if the catalyst gets disabled at start of next patch, or kept on?
[3:31:42] Heero_Effect: Is this the dragon age song?
[3:31:51] Jarlan23: what is that tuskarr toy from anyone know whats its called
[3:32:31] Aquadriel: @Towelliee been doing raid and 8/8 m+ since season start, only have 1 tier.
[3:32:33] Jarlan23: my guildmates got 4/4 tier and start bringing alts to get tier i lose the rolls every fucking time
[3:32:35] faulen: been playing since launch, 0 tier
[3:32:46] biirrd: vault can give you
[3:32:49] Disarmonia09: @Jarlan23 it's a consumable, Bluberry Muffin
[3:32:56] thebakeriscomingforu: Even in a raid, tier goes to top priority. So some players may not get it for some time.
[3:32:57] thatguynamedjans: So many people I bring up that argument to say the catalyst isnt fair for raiders, cause they have to 'Work" for their tier lol
[3:33:01] thatguynamedjans: Mindboggling
[3:33:08] Aquadriel: group loot doesnt help since people ninja and even guildies hoard it
[3:33:12] pk99: Me with my one piece like its a fkn anime
[3:33:12] RudeMood: I started two weeks behind, if i hadn't gotten tier in my vault i wouldn't have any
[3:33:16] snake_like: "but in classic we had to grind the raid for months for a full tier set"
[3:33:18] raldrik: Feels like they are trying to force more into raiding and it just isnt going to happen. Not everyone can set aside a schedule of their life to play a game. Family agro way too high, no amount of dodge will help.
[3:33:25] TheCheeseWheel87: I got my second tier piece from vault last night. but had to drop item lvl to use it
[3:33:27] Vapo: literally every raider is like "bring catalyst out earlier" KEKW
[3:33:32] Shuttlelol: only argument against catalyst is how much of a nerf tier can be to content
[3:33:35] Yagr6: I was lucky got tier each week from m+ vault and now im 4pc
[3:33:40] Shuttlelol: only argument against early catalyst is how much of a nerf tier can be to content
[3:33:40] adam6683: It’s item rack. I figured it out. I have been playing this game soo long and never came across that. 👍
[3:34:33] thatguynamedjans: @Shuttlelol The other argument ive seen is that "Then what would we work towards?" which I respond "the fun gameplay should be why we play as well" lol
[3:34:43] xo_navi: yeah the tier isn't that substantial for most classes this time around anyway
[3:34:52] Vapo: what

[3:35:02] xo_navi: now you have to grind out 16+ dungeons and shit just to get crafted pieces
[3:35:06] GameWithDerp: considering how good DF has been, im a bit disappointed how slow they are moving on some things
[3:35:07] Vapo: moonkin 4set was like 12k or something stupid
[3:35:10] xo_navi: it is definitely not alt friendly imo
[3:35:13] Shuttlelol: @Shuttlelol gameplay first :D
[3:35:20] Jarlan23: well shadowlands was more alt friendly than BFA
[3:35:22] Jarlan23: but still bad
[3:35:25] polaropposite76: the renown is frustrating on my alts even with the bonus
[3:35:29] thatguynamedjans: @JakeStoney  I thought that too, then I saw the sims, and tier is 15% damage increase for some classes. and for most 8%, not super insignificant
[3:35:46] Vapo: going terros without half of raid having 4sets was already miserable, what are you supposed to exactly work towards when you just hit hard wall cuz tier acquisiton is outdated
[3:35:54] Gitmm: looked like bullrush
[3:36:03] xo_navi: @datguynamedjans true but all the world first raiders just split and funnel heroic tier anyway
[3:36:24] Jarlan23: its been hard to crack into 15s and 16s just pugging
[3:36:24] Troniin: any news if they fixed the raid group problem from last night?
[3:36:27] Jarlan23: most of the keys fail
[3:36:30] xo_navi: Making mythic raiding harder to get into and impossible for alts to get into is only a bad thing for the game
[3:36:44] kashmara: There's a world quest bonus week coming up soon. Should be crazy on alts.
[3:36:51] Heero_Effect: :)
[3:36:59] Gitmm: how's monk buff feel
[3:37:13] xo_navi: I think mythic raiding is at a good difficulty level but acquisition of gear is bad and costly right now./
[3:37:13] polaropposite76: mythic raiding should be hard to get into. normal and heroic are there too for an easier barrier of entry
[3:37:15] Pallyofhell: pugs keep thinking they're top MDI teams and get picky in sub 10 keys
[3:37:38] Tautoo: those bones smash even on tyr weeks
[3:37:50] Jarlan23: ^ exactly. rogues and ench shamans are the only melee pugs want
[3:38:07] Heero_Effect: Also not to mention, tier can make classes more fun to play. Kinda sucks when you get weeks if I tier but Jimmy in your raid group has 4 set
[3:38:10] BoogiePonderosa: :(
[3:38:21] ceranac23: expansion is alt friendly u just log alt level to 70 and gearing up u dont need worry about nothing
[3:38:36] Pallyofhell: i finally got my 2 set on my evoker
[3:38:43] Luceinn: all classes are trash when i play them... feelsbad
[3:38:48] Pallyofhell: after how many weeks of the raid being out
[3:38:50] Jarlan23: what pisses me off is my guild has free roll turned on so these little rat alts get tier before my main
[3:38:55] Jarlan23: little rat evoker alts
[3:39:04] xo_navi: i shouldn't have to be spending absurd amounts of gold and farming 30 16 + keys to get crafted gear parity that's silly
[3:39:20] xo_navi: i mean they did make the enchants cheaper thats a start
[3:39:48] Colt_Engineer: gotta blas - Jimmy Neutron
[3:39:51] Sylphy_TV: ironmouseJam
[3:39:52] Jarlan23: the only tier i got from raid was in lfr
[3:39:55] Jarlan23: rest has been in my vault

[3:41:35] ohnot___her: @Jarlan23 why are alts allowed to come to main raids? NotLikeThis
[3:41:39] balancedlight: monks
[3:41:43] NierrEdits: enhance LUL
[3:41:53] NierrEdits: enhance is kinda gnarly without gear this expac
[3:42:15] Jarlan23: @OHHNOTHER because everyones main mostly has 4/4 tier so they dont need heroic anymore so they bring alts
[3:42:17] Pallyofhell: crusader strike was 40%
[3:42:17] Aquadriel: crus strike 40%
[3:42:18] snake_like: got an officer in my guild who has "switched mains" twice now and keeps eating tier tokens up lmao
[3:42:23] NierrEdits: devoker is feeling really nice on the damage side after this last reset.
[3:42:35] NierrEdits: oof
[3:42:48] Troniin: crusader strike was 45%, but that was because it was hitting for less than a white melee hit

[3:42:55] balancedlight: ret needs a rework overall. its feeling old
[3:42:55] Pallyofhell: that evoker buff was just a nerf revert they made back 2 weeks before launch
[3:43:18] Pallyofhell: rets feeling old?
[3:43:19] Snabido: Guild drama in the works 👀
[3:43:19] Thoreya: ya but evoker feels good now
[3:43:22] Thoreya: that buff helps
[3:43:26] biirrd: i called that "look for new guild now"
[3:43:26] Thoreya: its noticable
[3:43:27] Pallyofhell: bruh they were just reworked in legion
[3:43:28] Baron_Pandacula: @balancedlight i disagree majorly
[3:43:28] NierrEdits: the one class that wasnt op on launch as dps smh
[3:43:28] goddard1990: @Towelliee what is your partyframes down there? is that grid?

[3:43:48] Baron_Pandacula: Ret doesnt feel old to me

[3:44:38] Thoreya: towelliee doesnt use vuhdo. its all elvui

[4:07:57] roflpotamus: just got my wisdom teeth out yesterday
[4:08:03] xo_navi: like its a great idea but in theory on alts it sucks

[4:09:45] xo_navi: the top 2 enchants cost 100k each weapon for a month
[4:09:45] CeruleanStar: i think crafting is a good way to fill gaps - but dear lord the complexity
[4:10:00] adam6683: I still don’t understand it and just quit caring
[4:10:07] brooklynitetv: blizzard sucks at explaining anything
[4:10:08] Chris093: true
[4:10:12] BelacKriv: Yah, it's kinda a neat system, but really opaque
[4:10:18] tronbadgames: were making**
[4:10:18] ShadesOBlue: all they need to do is make the tooltips better
[4:10:20] warrenny: People refuse to read guides
[4:10:23] coldarmorTBG: I had no clue how I got primal focusses until yesterday lol
[4:10:28] tronbadgames: everyones got a lariat maker now
[4:10:29] Baron_Pandacula: i didnt even know that was something i should do until my friends told me about it
[4:10:29] Heero_Effect: @adam6683 word towHi
[4:10:32] ClassicMalcontent: No Lariat. /sad-panda
[4:10:33] Baron_Pandacula: like 2 days ago
[4:10:35] sinlesssinner: the answer to that question tho is, you cant get it lol cause that 418 gear is only for high end gamers
[4:10:41] snake_like: even giga crafters don't know exactly how crafting works yet. the "variance" thing separate from inspiration for example
[4:10:50] ClassicMalcontent: @shutupRoman wrong.
[4:10:54] sinlesssinner: what??
[4:11:02] LowKeyGaming: whats it cost to recraft one that youve already crafted at a lower level
[4:11:07] bachooga: bachooga subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 54 months! 
[4:11:08] Scarhearth: 411 yeah
[4:11:10] WaverlyP15: why is the lariat so desired? I got the neck from COS and think stat wise it is much better
[4:11:17] sinlesssinner: dude i dont raid and i gotta do mythic + 16s to get 418s
[4:11:19] xjr216x: you feel like dragonflight has alot to do prior from the other expansions. im thinking about coming back?
[4:11:32] sinlesssinner: it aint for casuals :'(
[4:11:38] BelacKriv: @waverlyp15 can add upto 3 sockets, plus emblishment
[4:11:39] tronbadgames: @ClassicMalcontent get outta here.. you know what I mean. dont be that guy
[4:11:40] mrrazputin: 10x16 ? do you listen to yourself :D ppl strugle to do +10
[4:11:41] sinlesssinner: casuals are stuck at 392

[4:11:45] brooklynitetv: So 5 SBG's a week
[4:11:53] sinlesssinner: yea
[4:11:54] gzus81: i wish the number of focus were cut in half
[4:11:56] sinlesssinner: thats doable
[4:11:56] Senile_Preacher: i just wish primal focus would be account bound or that you could buy a primal focus pack that is like anima in shadowlads for example
[4:11:58] Slapboxh: can't you only equip up to 3 crafted pieces now?
[4:12:07] WaverlyP15: @BelacKriv i added 3 sockets to my neckl;ace, maybe just the embellishment
[4:12:09] akia03: thats also from renown
[4:12:14] ClassicMalcontent: @shutupRoman you mean everyone you know. I don't have the pattern. And I 'dont know a guy' for it. Unfortunatelyu

[4:12:38] BelacKriv: @waverlyp15 yah, sorry, that's correct
[4:12:39] biirrd: 4 now
[4:12:40] Lexi__Marie: if i have a 405 lariat can i make it higher than that with an infusion i get later
[4:12:43] WaverlyP15: can only have 2 embellishments
[4:12:43] ClassicMalcontent: I can post for it. But will just keep grinding it out myself. And not buying it for 1-mil gold
[4:12:49] enygma_hobbies: can wear 3 embelishments if third is cooking one

[4:12:54] Tautoo: Im Single dad Casual AF but havent had any issue pugging my way to 2400 and getting my 418 crafted.  Tank life is pretty great
[4:12:57] Glisur85: I have only ran 1 +16 and that was this week and I am 399 ilvl
[4:12:58] snake_like: pretty sick process honestly. blast 10 to 16's and have an alt nearly full 405 to 418 after sparks start dropping
[4:12:59] Mecabeast: 3 if you include food buff one right?
[4:13:01] CeruleanStar: weapons take 2x sparks :(
[4:13:07] akia03: casuals get 5 405 bits of gear for free
[4:13:09] LeDerpski: after the next one yeah
[4:13:09] sinlesssinner: @Krait06 i am helping myself with pvp and igotta jump into m+11s  :'(
[4:13:16] CeruleanStar: i have a lariat + frostfire belt + weapon (had to remove embellishment when i made belt)
[4:13:17] tronbadgames: @ClassicMalcontent you know i mean they're more common now, you being some exception to my statement is whatever.. go away
[4:13:27] kashmara: I have 3 sparks but no recipes to use them with. Too casual. lol
[4:13:39] snake_like: tobs5HEAD smort
[4:13:42] WaverlyP15: @BelacKriv you're good. Just a weird desire for an item you can get thats better imo for just runnning a dungeon
[4:13:47] Sollice: @kashmara You dont need a recipe thats what work orders are for
[4:13:48] RudeMood: @kashmara crafting orders
[4:13:49] TialePetit: I have no sparks... even more casual :P lol
[4:13:49] ClassicMalcontent: @shutupRoman  more common yes I agree. Just not everyone but sure.
[4:13:50] akia03: @kashmara order bits
[4:14:01] Krait06: @sinlesssinner yeah highest i did was 12 i tried going higer but noone invites maybe cuz im a ret pally
[4:14:02] daconcion: Sparks are gonna drop at the same rate as legion leggos, so you might only see 1-2 a week if you're lucky
[4:14:03] kashmara: aha
[4:14:06] CloudPants8081: cooksuXEZ
[4:14:12] Mecabeast: is 418 the same as max valor upgrade? so raid and vault are only ways for better?

[4:14:59] Heero_Effect: towCopium
[4:15:00] PrimalRain: not bad, but not good either
[4:15:05] sinlesssinner: fire and purples
[4:15:09] Sarcastard: glove from the put fights
[4:15:12] rapheeki93: as a newer player that only wants to focus on one toon, whats a "Safe" class to pick for a dps? one that usually performs well season to season as long as i learn to play it. I can get down with damn near any playstyle / theme lol
[4:15:19] Sarcastard: pt*
[4:15:36] Sylphy_TV: There are much much worse xD
[4:15:39] CloudPants8081: cooksuXEZ
[4:15:39] JasperCalico: @simplicityfails warlock
[4:15:46] Itshiko: @Simplicityfails Demon hutner, mage, hunter, lock
[4:15:49] Cerbrus0: @Simplicityfails do you prefer melee or range?
[4:15:52] spyrit14: warlock
[4:16:06] Itshiko: Honestly just dpeneds on your playstyle
[4:16:08] Lostdogal: @Simplicityfails warlock, DH, Hunter
[4:16:11] Itshiko: Mage/lock is bet bet for range
[4:16:22] RudeMood: @Simplicityfails any of the dps classes that only have dps specs will always have at least one consistently performing spec at any given point in time. pick a flavor.
[4:16:25] rapheeki93: idc bout range or melee, playstyles an etc just im sure blizz has classes that dont get nerfed as often as others lol
[4:16:29] Scarhearth: @Simplicityfails DH imo
[4:16:31] rapheeki93: heard about shamans rarely getting love
[4:16:32] spyrit14: lock is easiest to level too
[4:16:35] xo_navi: yeah people always need a mage / lock who isn't terrible
[4:16:35] JasperCalico: Warlock is always good and if it isn’t you still get into groups bc summons and cookies
[4:16:35] ClassicMalcontent: @shutupRoman ha ha I mean just 'gift me one for free' and I'll stop complaining about being 'a guy still grinding for the pattern to drop'. Kappa
[4:16:43] WaverlyP15: mage /lock. or DH for melee
[4:16:55] Itshiko: Lock and hunter ez too lvl
[4:16:57] WaverlyP15: rogue is also agood melee
[4:17:05] Itshiko: Rogue good for melee too
[4:17:09] Itshiko: ditto
[4:17:09] Scarhearth: Shamans have gotten alot of love specifically enhancement atm even though they got like 2 nerfs since launch still a great class
[4:17:12] Aegllor: I have to run 29 more 16s to upgrade my 3 pieces of gear.
[4:17:18] Jango_: Feral is actually feeling pretty good
[4:17:33] spyrit14: the shaman stuggle is real
[4:17:42] Diecast669: love my feral
[4:17:57] WaverlyP15: Shaman is one of my favorite classes, but i play elemental, still very fun and alot of group utility
[4:18:21] Carahail: @Diecast669 does wowhead have a good guide for first time ferals?
[4:18:33] Scarhearth: Shamans main issue is the later 20+ keys their lack of good defensive utility hurts them
[4:18:39] CYNIC308: how is the new patch mixing up the meta?
[4:18:41] fire_fawkes: Used to love healing on shaman
[4:18:42] xo_navi: ele sham is great tbh enhance is just slightly better and has windfury
[4:18:49] agg_ie: @Carahail Icyviens does
[4:19:02] Jango_: @Carahail  yeah
[4:19:05] Carahail: @agg_ie sweet ty so much
[4:19:24] spyrit14: lock offers the best all around class, in every season
[4:19:26] Carahail: @Jango_ ty ty
[4:19:48] Diecast669: yeah the one I read seem pretty legit

[4:22:00] xo_navi: i mean compare it to evoker it does nothing better
[4:22:10] fire_fawkes: Yeah
[4:22:18] Scarhearth: resto shamans just dont have the tools to handle massive damage intake on a whole group
[4:22:24] xo_navi: has some okay utility thats about it
[4:22:25] fire_fawkes: I run resto Druid
[4:22:28] Diecast669: I like to run heavy into the are bleeds and still have console and feral frenzy for single target burst
[4:22:44] Diecast669: AoE*
[4:22:44] WaverlyP15: @JakeStoney oh im not saying its better than evoker rn,
[4:23:10] Diecast669: rdruid feels really good right now too
[4:23:26] fire_fawkes: Evoker is so different from Druid I can’t get a hold of it well enough
[4:23:41] Scarhearth: I like resto druids, and i feel they have better tools than evoker with repairing damage taken. evoker when they run out of CDs ive noticed its a struggle to keep people up at times
[4:23:47] WaverlyP15: rdruid is good, but ive had more r druids that dont know their class more than other
[4:23:48] fire_fawkes: The range they have to be is weird
[4:24:08] fire_fawkes: True
[4:24:28] WaverlyP15: @fire_fawkes personally made and evoker and stopped immediatley. just hate the play style
[4:24:35] ScalarGaming: how are the BRM changes feeling? @towelliee
[4:24:44] fire_fawkes: Agreed
[4:24:55] darkdestroz: just got back from helping mother move a bunch a fking boxes, id be pissed if stream was alredy over XD,
[4:24:57] polaropposite76: my resto druid felt more...peaceful to play than my preservation evoker.
[4:25:05] pereadin: I'm always down bro
[4:25:06] shadodefiant: @Towelliee room for my rogue?  went with u other day
[4:25:07] leaprah: leaprah subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 53 months! 
[4:25:15] fire_fawkes: Yeah evoker is stressful lol
[4:25:32] WaverlyP15: @Darkaine2 every class to me feels more comfortable/fun than evoker
[4:25:32] faulen: It does not feel like it was enough compared to other tanks
[4:25:33] shadodefiant: @pereadin loggin now
[4:25:38] Scarhearth: i'll stick around to pump AA if you'd like @Towelliee
[4:25:40] fmfsinned90: @pereadin how is your healing hitting 50-70k? lol just rotation or stats?
[4:25:56] pereadin: @shadodefiant i ammm i ammmm lol had to switcch from the evoker
[4:26:08] shadodefiant: lol
[4:26:14] parad12e: what are the top 3 tanks ?
[4:26:39] WaverlyP15: @parad12e prot warrior, then the rest
[4:27:12] tronbadgames: hows DH right now?
[4:27:23] WaverlyP15: dk is good especially for snaguine weeks
[4:27:41] BoyLame: @Towelliee im new to WoW and ive hit level 70 on my Prot warrior and dont exactly know where to go now? like what should I focus on end game?
[4:27:49] voyage_icarus: I’m looking to get back in the game. I remember there were websites you could get memberships a little cheaper. Are those still a thing?
[4:27:54] thatguynamedjans: I think after the buffs it has gotten to a point where I want to take tanks other than warriors for utility. Like Prot pally for interupts
[4:27:55] xo_navi: blood dk can solo bosses
[4:27:57] pereadin: its cause of dorki imo
[4:27:58] Pallyofhell: its probably for the aoe grip
[4:28:05] Heero_Effect: Lol I take any tank I can ;)
[4:28:08] xo_navi: well so can prot i guess but blood dk is insane LUL
[4:28:19] Scarhearth: blood DK is just so strong when played correctly
[4:28:35] thatguynamedjans: I love having prot pally tanks in Halls :D Bop for wolf boss + mad interupts

[4:28:59] WaverlyP15: @Scarhearth really is, has more utility than prot warrior IMO, and im a prot warr main
[4:29:28] WaverlyP15: i just prefer sword and board tanks
[4:30:00] thatguynamedjans: Its hard to put a value on dk grip, AND battle rez? plus they can handle their own healing themselveD? yes please
[4:30:02] Pallyofhell: bird has been a problem? its always that damn tree
[4:30:08] Yagr6: @Towelliee opinion on queing into glads at 1400? like u can see the glad mounts
[4:30:25] Molvonos: @Pallyofhell Tree's the weakest link of the dungeon in higher keys

[4:30:35] Snabido: Timing DS's and you're on a good path
[4:30:41] Scarhearth: @Scarhearth I love my prot war but im an enha shaman main this xpac just because my static M+ group the BDK in my group is a way better tank than I am in comparison
[4:30:42] WaverlyP15: bird boss is easy, especially once you teach the group you dont have to do the balls after the first lol
[4:30:49] Pallyofhell: @GrandmaTroyb you failed that so much LUL
[4:31:16] Wolfehammer: @towelliee what time do you run on your bdk?
