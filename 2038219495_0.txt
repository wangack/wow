[0:26:22] zerossussy: check dslice sandglass just incase
[0:26:38] zerossussy: u lose stas from thorncaller
[0:26:44] zerossussy: thats why 486 crafted is rly good
[0:26:45] xEllixd: Thorncaller has less agi and stats
[0:26:51] tempestyn: you lose secondary and mainstat
[0:27:07] zerossussy: and the thorncaller ability is spread when adds are involved

[0:27:18] mepango: remember to fix stats

[3:40:34] gonzobone: rogues have stances in macros
[3:40:38] Dorittolol: have you tried casting between the eyes
[3:40:38] gonzobone: there's just a delay

[3:40:55] Prime_Rage: [known:dispatch]dispatch
[3:40:56] Sleikjo: Did you let the other outlaw win on the dmg meter or was it skill issues?
[3:41:08] gonzobone: that's not the use case here at all @Prime_Rage
[3:41:11] Adrenzy: between the eyes dispatches anyway
[3:41:16] the_bhagwan: eyes = dispatch tho
[3:41:22] andyandrzej: what macro i need to play outlaw and blasting?
[3:41:22] memewizardgod: @ZujuZtyle HEY GUY
[3:41:30] Blubhochzehn: look at vanish and dance casts
[3:41:30] andyandrzej: macros*

[3:42:29] Tossthesalad1: Ask Tom if he uses a macro or just does it natty?
[3:42:35] chipzzbe: @GingiTV can you show your macro? I know quite a bit about macros and lua programming, and "My macro is bugged" sounds unlikely, if it's written correctly. What's more likely is that the damage gets recorded incorrectly.
[3:42:48] GaryNec: MAY I TANK THIS ONE????
[3:42:56] imanyone: It's his 95% AR uptime vs yours
[3:42:57] gonzobone: no there's just a delay with the way stances work so it casts dispatch on the first GCD instead of BTE
[3:43:12] sunnib01: what would u consider the best rogue spec? kush playing alot of sub and jpc also
[3:44:00] Djeet90: Hey Sir, I reached 3k for the first time playing firemage and start to overthink things regarding Stats. Is it best to just mimic the gear of the highest rated players as close as possible filling items  I miss with crafted of the same stats?
[3:44:18] gonzobone: i think you're better off just having two separate macros for dispatch and BTE and then a WA that tracks your shadow dance/vanish uptime

[3:45:52] johnwayne383: Tompelvis is a big dog
[3:45:56] roystrat: compare vanish casts

[3:47:22] Dorittolol: try doing it natty
[3:47:22] zerossussy: @GothicWolfLight Susge true
[3:47:26] east_8: @zelcione talent
[3:47:36] Duckwiin: Guess just play it natty
[3:47:38] gonzobone: there's just a lag time between a macro understanding a stance change
[3:47:44] minjiang2: how’s other rogue doing it?
[3:47:46] Flekx_: lets see, prob u can finish it
[3:47:50] Duckwiin: That's what i do atleast
[3:47:50] gigfc: macro got stance delay
[3:47:57] mepango: maybe play around with ur spellqueue

[3:48:08] gonzobone: just have a wa
[3:48:11] GothicWolfLight: guess we play macroless
[3:48:11] Sarmix_: thats the point of the macro? why not just use between the eyes?
[3:48:12] ImNilzen: Between the eyes first? if that matters at all for prio??
[3:48:12] oleolel: i just switch bte and dp on my stealthed bar and natty
[3:48:13] andy0g: something in atal u need ?
[3:48:17] Tgloss22: you think macroing ghostly strike is worth ? a lot of the big rogues say you dont wanna do that
[3:48:26] gonzobone: @Sarmix_ it goes on CD if you're not in stealth
[3:48:31] mepango: play it natty like a real rogue GIGACHAD
[3:48:33] Sponsorn: try and see if a ; works better
[3:48:50] panta_xdd: Change the order and try again
[3:48:51] bulfoooz: smile gingo :)

[4:00:36] deanw0w69: @Zaitex04 or ss
[4:00:57] Zaitex04: yea if your low on combo points
[4:01:13] Neozz1: Have two macros, one for not in stealth which uses shadow dance then put another macro on your stealth bar for bte without SD.
[4:01:54] Neozz1: So when not in stealth it tries to use SD before BTE (off the GCD) then on stealth bar just a normal or GS BTE

[4:06:07] Goliathse: Does he need to roll on the floor each time the WA calls it?
[4:06:27] whymurl: so clean omg holy sh
[4:06:31] Neozz1: @Zaitex04 With the macro I mentioned it's easy, and you don't need a SD keybind. If SD is up you push BTE macro and it puts you in SD, after if BTE and vanish is up you just vanish bte
[4:06:45] whymurl: its look so ewasy but when i play its so difficult
[4:07:20] koulou7: !roll

[4:08:31] afyra: Do 30s for 4 items kekw
[4:08:57] gulliblelion: shadow dance
[4:09:30] Neozz1: You always want to use SD before BTE so the BTE macro on my non-stealth bar has SD macrod to it. Then the BTE on my stealth bar has BTE with only GS macrod
[4:09:35] Zaitex04: @Neozz1 to many buttons for that its just not efficient, by making vanish and shadow dance unavailable to press during subterfurge makes it 100x easier
[4:09:40] Neozz1: 1 bar slot and 1 less keybind.
[4:10:05] n0tDef1ned: HUH
[4:10:09] Neozz1: @Zaitex04 It's less buttons, not more.
