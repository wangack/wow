[4:24:54] idiotferaltko: these are just pve server issues lol! I never join a grp that mages dont know whats up
[4:25:31] rat1ife: you should level a new character on crusader strike with the exp buff
[4:26:11] idiotferaltko: on crusader strike and lone wolf  this is all I have done for like 3 weeks and never had to get in discord once. People just know how to do it
[4:27:19] workandkil: Players don't pick servers thinking that everyone on said server knows the fundamentals of collective coordination
[4:28:05] delirious555: The blood god looks thirsty for Swifty's blood. :)
[4:28:05] idiotferaltko: i mean i would willing to bet ppl that play on a pvp server are much better at pvp than on a pve server

[4:29:03] Majeye: @jahjahgoboom not necessarily true, a bunch of us (back when we played) were forced to play on a pvp server because one or two of our friends refused to play on anything else.

[4:29:55] Majeye: @jahjahgoboom and thats also not true, pvpers tend to have heightened awarenesses, usually have better map awareness, know their surroundings a tad better.  I'd argue and say pvp'ers probably make better raiders.
[4:30:02] Sowiloo: you need to group 100%
[4:30:52] psykfall69: @jahjahgoboom kek what
[4:31:12] idiotferaltko: pve is the same thing over and over lol how much awareness do you really need,,,all I do is pve for the past 10 years
[4:31:17] Juicewisdom: axeumSip
[4:31:25] idiotferaltko: and 100% raiders are better at raiding then me...its litearlly the same thing over and over
