[4:34:32] AndyStarhol: Tesla Wall is totally fine they install battery packs that work with soalr setups on your house
[4:34:34] Tomoglaziat: a wall of batteries
[4:34:36] xJPMx: i have a generator  for when power goes out
[4:34:42] ToastLamoan: Tesla wall can be connected to your home power or with solar
[4:34:49] ToastLamoan: or both
[4:34:57] draxss: its backup power for what we dont use though out the day

[4:35:08] Partytime9: Tesla wall- battery bank
[4:35:20] xJPMx: yeah
[4:35:30] ToastLamoan: outages, your car, its how you want to set it up
[4:35:39] xJPMx: even those don't work like that, they basically reduce your power bill according to how much power your solar panels made
[4:35:40] Tomoglaziat: u can power everything
[4:35:40] AndyStarhol: Theoretically, that powered with a sufficeint soalr system you could de facto remove yourself from the grid
[4:35:47] Tomoglaziat: lots
[4:35:47] xJPMx: so you don't actually support your house with the solar panels
[4:35:47] ToastLamoan: its quoted
[4:35:49] ToastLamoan: it depends
[4:35:52] Tomoglaziat: 15k
[4:36:00] corruptReality: @swifty solar tax write off in Florida
[4:36:15] draxss: i paided around 17k after everything
[4:36:16] corruptReality: ya
[4:36:17] AndyStarhol: That with  solar system could be 40k plus depending on the size of your home
[4:36:17] Partytime9: 25k in aus
[4:36:42] xJPMx: or you can pay for a gas generator lol
[4:36:44] AndyStarhol: Depends on what panels and if you do the solar tiles, the soalr panels that look like normal roofing tiles
[4:36:46] MollywhopGoat: you should be able to write it off in every state. gotta pay up front, but write it off later
[4:36:46] Onehiitter: i was about to say better check with hoa
[4:36:51] ToastLamoan: 12k - 17k depending where you are at
[4:37:20] ToastLamoan: every new house in the US should be required to have solar these days

[5:17:21] liorem_: @bergolho lmao no
[5:17:46] Mendil91: I never really understood what GDKP is
[5:17:50] Pallyofhell: google facts are all based on data from 3.3.5a
[5:17:50] xzoeeeeee: are you telling me you didn't find that treasure under the ocean in a shipwreck?!
[5:17:56] Pallyofhell: we're on 3.4 patch
[5:17:58] Kalaaleq: @Swifty And right now there is 4 GDKP groups right now, but I don't think they need carries.
[5:17:59] quite_unpleasant: Prot Warrior is the highest damage and aoe threat, Pally the best raid utility, DK the best single target mitigation, Bear is the average of all this stuff... there is no "best" tank in wrath really
[5:17:59] KurushiKG: so every other class sucks when compared to paladin in wotlk then
[5:18:03] MartittaXoXo: Yeah I’m sad was levelling my rogue and the servers shutdown on me swiftyUp swiftyUp
