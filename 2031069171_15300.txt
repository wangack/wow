[5:32:14] hitstar98: 1v1 arena ?
[5:32:23] bassiemon123: How would u feel about gurubashi being an instance event instead of open world
[5:32:31] Dutchlocked: yeah arena would mean they'd have to balance classes around it as well. just joined so maybe you already said this
[5:32:34] jazni_23: flying mounts and queing for dungeons killed world pvp, no reason to be in the world other than to level
[5:32:51] Vastatio: whats the heartbeat thing?
[5:33:07] pinnacle1: Retail WOW feels like a MOBA with permanent gear
[5:33:16] Alfurias: i like achievements so i always have something to do in retail
[5:33:20] Lfcrit: not when you have to walk to the isntances
[5:33:39] Iketh: when did you stop playing retail?
[5:33:42] muchtar92: on point
[5:33:44] Dutchlocked: I like walking to the instance with my buddies
[5:33:49] muchtar92: exactly
[5:33:51] Dutchlocked: and doing some wpvp on the way
[5:33:52] ugandanairforcee: exactly
[5:33:58] pinnacle1: You can also just hand people their gear at the door, because farming gear is tedious Kappa
[5:33:59] foresterny: exactly
[5:34:00] muchtar92: thats why retail is boring
[5:34:00] Lfcrit: yes, dungeon finder ruined the game
[5:34:07] Vastatio: i like the fact that there's no summonstones
[5:34:11] zaz_D: i like LFG for finding ppl for dungeon, but i wish it didnt teleport
[5:34:11] Bootch: OhISee
[5:34:13] SnakeHelah: YOU THINK YOU DO. But you dont
[5:34:18] Azrion_the_many: if you can just teleport everywhere. why would they bother making the entire zones that the dungeons are in when they could just make.. more dungeons
[5:34:21] addiox2: i want
[5:34:26] Vastatio: i do want quality of life tho.. GIVE ME A CALENDAR THAT I CAN MAKE EVENTS ON
[5:34:27] hitstar98: yeah true..flying mount is boring..negates view of zones and questing fun
[5:34:37] Fossabot: @takamura_mimis, Please ask for permission to post a link. [warning]
[5:34:43] MrBingbo: thats why flying mounts and dungeon finder tanked world pvp and exploration
[5:34:44] Scroep11: yes, but you come from a place where you can afford to play wow for x hours, many people do not have that luxury
[5:34:53] Scroep11: so those qol changes you mention, are kinda needed
[5:34:54] bubbles_pvp: Boring and fun is personal
[5:34:54] ssoftspots: wasn't all the updates made in retail wow demanded by players back than ?
[5:34:54] jazni_23: flying and queing killed world pvp
[5:34:55] flowen001: do we want dual talent ?
[5:34:55] juicebarspecial: i love wandering through the world. I save a lot of people and buff em with fort <3
[5:34:59] Scroep11: despire that is "ruining" the game
[5:35:00] NwOsmo: too much logic... stop scarring us
[5:35:03] blyd00: facts bro i dont even like flying mounts
[5:35:11] gad0wa: y but its very helpful if you dont have so much time to play
[5:35:11] Lfcrit: but imagine walking to stranglethorn arena to queue up for 1v1, 2v2, 3v3 etc
[5:35:13] morphyck: Instan mail please 🙏

[5:35:57] pinnacle1: A lot of quality of life changes come at the cost of something else that isnt so obvious
[5:36:03] jazni_23: i 100% vote for dual spec, i hated spending 100g a week just to switch from raid to pvp spec and back

[5:36:35] BetterHalfGaming: I love BoWisdom and BoMight but i want 15-30 min duration because 5 min buffs suck
[5:37:27] pathowatch: buffing is what pallys do though
[5:37:54] takamura_mimis: do u like that it takes u 30 mins to find a group for dungeon,20 mins to go there all together ,and at the first wipe u disband ?
[5:37:57] mekazen: I like flint and tinder and simple wood to drop a fire
[5:37:59] jazni_23: all these things give character to the game
[5:38:03] trmonx: pallies already have 30min blessings later on, if we are stuck at low level raiding no harm making bless longer duration
[5:38:06] pinnacle1: Oh so thats why you're in bulgaria Kappa
[5:38:07] mcflurry45: i pray for dual spec every day

[5:39:00] Adrenalinefl: like professions
[5:39:03] Iketh: in ultima online pvp you would lose all your gear if you died
[5:39:08] Azrion_the_many: omfg everquest was crazy. i never played but i remember watching my buddy's dad play and certain skills having multi hour/day cooldowns sometimes
[5:39:10] Iketh: pve as well
[5:39:26] jazni_23: how did they ruin it?
[5:39:34] Azrion_the_many: it was that or guild wars 1 but i swear it was eq
[5:39:34] belfastcl: new world devs are terrible
[5:39:37] Vastatio: new world was good except for endgame which was so boring (farming gear)
[5:39:37] mcflurry45: so many hours spent grinding pvp meter on new world for it not to work
[5:39:58] loader1990: nice beard !
[5:40:23] MrBingbo: it was also totally unknown what to do at the time, blizzard sort of paved the way for the more "modern" mmo, so they thought quality of life = better gameplay
[5:40:33] jazni_23: i wonder how many game developers are out there that put creating a good game first over gaining profit

[5:47:34] jazni_23: what's your top 3 quality games of all time outside of wow?
[5:47:41] lekkerrichard1: you would just get alot of private servers no?
[5:47:43] Spruehfurz88: there would be new bgs, pve environments, jumping/climbing maps
[5:47:50] SnakeHelah: @Bootch  iseen people use the meteor shard instead, but i already vendored it LUL

[5:53:02] Hurinus: Call Ukraine
[5:53:08] Bootch: like the black road, defiance, guilds of hyppos
[5:53:09] trmonx: there is no wow editor, just spaghetti on top of spaghetti
[5:53:46] zanics: lasagne code
[5:53:52] Koshintu: They might not want to divide the playerbase even more such that theres a ton of servers but most dead
[5:53:59] jazni_23: i think there's literally 1 guy pulling his hair out trying to manage all version of wow atm
[5:54:01] yungpex: Thats how dota became a game, mod in wc3 and now its the game with highest price pools in the world
[5:54:16] Beertje90: i think private servers are just the regular client connecting to "private" login servers right?
[5:54:19] macdaddypappasmurf: blizz prob doesn’t want a mother dota
[5:54:20] Totesmag0tes: the same people that made CS bought dota
[5:54:28] Bootch: more than hundreds

[5:54:56] eddy9222: chivalry 2 was a mod
[5:54:59] Jahzik: True. Most are at least.
[5:55:03] eddy9222: for hl2
[5:55:31] kaw00ki: you cannot compare CS where only 10-30 ppl are participating in one server with WoW where each server should have a few thousand ppl to be playable
[5:55:33] lunkb3ck: !addon
[5:55:34] StreamElements: The voice over addon is called "VoiceOver" and the death log addon is called "Deathlog".
[5:55:35] StreamElements: RULES: 1) No backseat gaming. I will do whatever I feel like doing. 2) Be nice.
[5:55:40] Zayphee: gta rp is also just a mod of gta 5
[5:55:47] Jahzik: Don't think BR came from Minecraft, but I agree and its also a fact that CS is a HL mod. LoL and Dota are Warcraft 3 custom maps and so much more examples.
[5:56:05] StreamElements: Check out and subscribe to my YouTube channel! -> https://www.youtube.com/psheor
[5:56:18] Jahzik: The reason I think BR didn't come from Minecraft is because of DayZ and H1Z1, which were the first games to make BRs famous and from where the trend started, I believe.

[6:03:51] zPeshy: @Spruehfurz88 You're thinking about it all wrong. If your team gets 1000 kills you dont win. You must play the obj to win. You can win with no kills, but you cant win with no obj

[7:49:24] TweakT: As long as there’s no RMT involved you can trade anything tradable to anyone. The only issue comes from you having no protection with support for a cross game deal. The other issue being their system might auto flag a big trade as RMT with no past player interaction and i don’t really think there’s anything you can do about that other than hope that if you appeal you get a real human CS agent. - from reddit
