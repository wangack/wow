[5:41:17] Kneckt: @ninethree maybe PRK which is what I had, instead of making a flap with a instrument they just use the laser and laser out the “flap” instead. it’s just a longer healing time
[5:41:23] Eshel: i've had metal slivers drilled out of my eye twice... and the scariest part was the dremel thing they used looked HUGE coming at the eye lmfao

[5:41:41] valianya: Do you use the prescription glasses?  I got an Rx pair with my updated prescription.  Everything looks just a little bit farther away now, it's a bit disorienting when moving around and moving my head.  I'm hoping I'll just need a bit to adjust.  Is this normal when updating a prescription?  I haven't had to update it before.  But reading stuff at a distance is great now.
[5:41:41] Kaykerrs: seriously debating lasik myself i recently had to get bifocals I'd prefer no glasses at all but I am so farsighted lol
