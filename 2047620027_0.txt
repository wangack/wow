[4:50:29] hdott52: fyrakk might end NA's last hope before it starts
[4:50:51] lattsx: its wild that drohgoh raid leads while healing
[4:51:15] drdrozd12: raiding leading on hpal is insane
[4:51:32] lyc420: yea on hpal that's crazy
[4:51:35] hothotboxthecar: ranged dps or tank usually
[4:51:42] lattsx: if you're actually in raid i feel like ranged dps raid lead is bis
[4:52:15] lattsx: ranged can see everything at least
[4:52:21] Isolol: tank if you have multitasking ability, ranged dps if you lack multitasking
[4:52:36] Ghrolz: Bm hunter proba easy to lead :)
[4:52:37] lyc420: bm hunter prob better, no need to cast
[4:52:38] burne114: is it "press a single healing cd"?
[4:53:22] mardybm: BALL BALL BALL?
[4:53:30] menzlo: press swarm
[4:53:33] menzlo: press tree
[4:53:35] sw0ngs: lol rise is fun to heal? tell that to jb hahaha
[4:53:43] sw0ngs: jb hates this place haha
[4:53:51] Ghrolz: Jb hates everything :)
[4:53:54] Relynia: jb hates everything
[4:53:58] Relynia: lmao beat me to it
[4:54:06] Ghrolz: lol
[4:54:14] lyc420: wait until you heal tyran everbloom
[4:54:39] lyc420: and your dps sucks ass at the last boss
[4:55:04] burne114: I think it's because it's a hard dungeon for healers to do much. its easy to heal if everyone plays well, and impossible to save if people wanna fuck up
[4:55:21] Morblee: i mean, it's been a bit since i was able to watch stream but now Dorki is healer? whaaaat??
[4:55:36] iDeez88: Here's a fully cooked idea, healers should always be able to cast while moving, always
[4:55:43] Morblee: hero of the people
[4:55:54] LsWRLD420: healing is the easiest job says the chatters earlier

[4:56:06] greaterlock: dorki got bored of being top dps. healing is next
[4:56:11] ShabsieAU: healing is basically a cosmetic role
[4:56:34] bonez89: Shit never seen dorki heal
[4:56:38] sw0ngs: double dragons and last pack before last boss sucks in pugs
[4:56:39] Morblee: i should ask all my healing specific questions here now right
[4:57:01] bonez89: Is there some healer movement going on here
[4:57:32] iDeez88: healing isnt "hard" in 25+'s, because people are competent, its aids in 11-19s

[4:59:23] MicHawkh: u are so much better than jb healing on druid
[5:00:01] trickyshot_: this don't feel right

[5:05:40] myatmon123: per tree
[5:05:44] burne114: 1%
[5:06:01] TTv_Thora: are you learning the spec in a 29
[5:06:03] Satimy: always wild growth after swiftmend
[5:06:11] burne114: WG with SM is the most efficient hps
[5:06:36] Satimy: and use trees is prolly the best skill as is lifebloom because it gives you free regrowths which can go on 3 people
[5:06:36] Meteox: Anyone seen Zach around? modCheck
[5:06:53] burne114: efflo might technically be more efficient, but not for lots of movement like this room
[5:07:32] Satimy: efflo is great with dream blossoms if you have any mastery
[5:07:41] Satimy: spring blossoms
[5:08:18] burne114: @Satimy yeh but utilizing the mastery does require casting other spells. so if you're oom and trying to be hyper efficient you might avoid it
[5:08:20] Satimy: swiftmend wildgrowth hard carrys dungeons though
[5:08:40] Satimy: @burne114 the trees casting nourish benefit from mastery dont they?
[5:09:21] burne114: yea!

[6:44:32] Toketems: @dorki who‚Äôs on the mdi team
[6:45:44] reedsworld: @Clush___ for sure i know its possible but i play mage, kind of annoying to pug. ive always pugged but kinda getting over it
[6:46:17] miiloswow: @Clush___  very doable for sure, but when my key gets bricked its impossible to get into any keys I need, feel like it depends on what class u play so you get into groups easier
[6:46:42] Clush___: @miiloswow if you arent playing one of the 5 best specs (the ones that the streamers told everyone are the best) then you wont get invited just the way its always been
[6:46:46] miiloswow: @Clush___  could also be times im queing too

[6:47:09] notfatdan: @reedsworld mage is good for pugging tho
[6:47:28] miiloswow: @Clush___  if i had more than 3 hours a day to play im sure it wouldnt be an issue, but just sitting in que for an hour is not it lol
[6:47:36] ZellieMasters: I've noticed a difference as a balance player in survivability by having both of the well honed instincts which auto casts frenzied regeneration and the cooldown is pretty low
[6:47:46] Clush___: @miiloswow oh yea 3 hours is absolutely not enough time if your only pushing is through lfg
[6:48:05] Thowarr: @Clush___ well per the recent PoddyC, your "friends" are expendable. If you want IO, then you're always climbing. Kick those leeches off and ascend
[6:48:46] miiloswow: @Clush___  yeah its kinda ass, i've gotten a few friends, sped it up, but god damn up untill 2 weeks ago it was really slow pushing
[6:48:48] Thowarr: It's what Growl and Dorki have advocated for a while now. Don't be afraid to jettison underperformers, ABC
[6:48:55] stiknork: isnt dk kick 10yd too or no
[6:48:58] Clush___: @Thowarr i dont have any friends ive added zero people in the last 2 seasons to my bnet. i just join pugs and if they ask for discord i instantly leave xdd
[6:49:34] epicninja808: blood dk prison KEKW
[6:49:35] ZellieMasters: @Clush___ or struggle through the season like I did with my demon hunter in season 4 shadowlands
[6:49:38] Thowarr: @Clush___ Second piece of advice from the Pod: when you encounter better players, leech on to them and don't let go.
[6:49:42] glick: dk kick is a spell mybe that messes with it
[6:50:05] Clush___: @ZellieMasters pain
[6:50:40] ZellieMasters: best advice - don't use wowhead go watch some of the top dps who are listed on raider.io and copy their builds and figure out the rotation/stats
[6:51:46] Clush___: id do anything for solo que
[6:51:49] breadwilton: ya idk wowhead is good for starting out but i swear i end up not doing half of it
[6:52:30] notfatdan: @Stompsville or you probably do but its more intuitive than it seems when you first read it
[6:52:37] TheSweeneyGG: Dorki only doing single pulls? This is not the Dorki of old
[6:52:37] Thowarr: Because that's most of what wowhead is: an initial starting point. After that it's starting to deep dive in discord specific forums, watching streamers, etc
[6:52:57] ZellieMasters: yeah so they usually don't take into account some of the passive things that happen when you combine certain stats with certain abilities and usually base their info off of raidbot sims which are heavily raid single target focused and not really useful for dungeons
[6:53:02] notfatdan: thats what ive noticed. Guide seems confusing asf, then i intuitevly figure out the rotation and the guide becomes useless and more confusing than it actually is
[6:53:25] VelocityVolt: whats the point of killing that stuff?
[6:53:53] imcolorblind: hu
[6:53:54] imcolorblind: hi
[6:54:14] imcolorblind: y boomie squishie
[6:54:20] ZellieMasters: so like dots usually they scale with haste on most classes but they'll tell you mastery is more important
[6:54:33] chrono_za: 30 rise, joever
[6:54:56] imcolorblind: ballmball
[6:54:59] imcolorblind: ball ball
[6:55:31] ZellieMasters: but there are built in haste boosters and mastery boosters in the talent tree that sometimes that don't get taken into consideration
[6:55:39] goop: holy fug ur alive
[6:56:08] Thowarr: @ZellieMasters it's because of how mastery double dips with both nature/arcane
[6:56:19] flockheart: chicken lives forever

[7:16:20] chalupascript: doesnt even talk in mdi?
[7:16:23] chalupascript: wtf
[7:16:40] chalupascript: is he mute or just doesnt like to talk?
[7:16:57] suinetel: Wait? Drogoh doesnt talk even in MDI setting? :o Like ofc you can play how you want and be mute 98% of time, but
[7:17:13] DinkytheDoodle: How can you expect to do keys that level and not talk?
[7:17:19] dajeetv: droghoh talks too much :P
[7:17:19] Clush___: ive heard jr talk before im pretty sure
[7:17:50] suinetel: @dorki  HUH? that was news!
[7:17:57] Finfen: I used to play 3‚Äòs with a guy like that, the most absurd warlock I have ever seen, but he said like 8 words in 5 years
[7:17:58] Strewgle: we love a hyper verbal tank
[7:17:59] whoknowsdude_: giga verbal
[7:18:06] DinkytheDoodle: I was speaking about current keys not your past stuff

[7:18:13] Juanzary: Hyberverbal is the result of being nonverbal for to long KEKW
[7:18:27] YoDaTV: she said thanks for not killing my chunks
[7:18:28] dajeetv: @DinkytheDoodle jr is still pushing the top key this season
[7:18:31] Yuccalyptus: she said "thank you for being ethical" lmao
[7:18:32] Archerone: JR promised himself to a Taylor Swift, but she would only accept him if he cut out his tongue so he could not share her secretes. Then she dumbed him for a dumb sport man.
[7:18:34] imawoooga: meg said "thanks for being ethical" because u let the chunks live so she could spin to heal
[7:18:37] literallywhylol: chunks lived
[7:18:49] imwhitetyrone123: go watch thasilk
[7:18:54] focuschitv: I was playing with a hyper verbal tank today and it was just makes the key so smooth
[7:19:02] morefishHD: how do you filter out chonks
[7:19:37] YoDaTV: filter out chunks but not dreadpetals..
[7:19:38] YoDaTV: weird..
[7:19:39] suinetel: @dorki I think better pinging game from all people could improve PuGs so much who dont do discord ofc most of the time.
[7:19:43] chalupascript: thats the most ethical thing ive ever heard
[7:19:58] kaspagre: Dreadpetals give count
[7:20:02] chalupascript: i just eye beam and stare at the meters fuck that
[7:20:21] miiloswow: @suinetel  people have gotten mad at me for pinging too much
[7:20:25] zuzua90: aye it‚Äôs dorki
[7:20:35] YoDaTV: 10 dread petals + boss = single target scenario.. but dorki starfalls..
[7:20:58] KillchainGames: hey chat / dorki i play on Oceanic realms from australia but i find myself more playing at US times im trying to figure out whether its worth xfering to US realms and dealing with the 200ms but wondering how much impact the higher ping will have i do mid mythic raiding and up to 25's or so in keys
[7:20:58] Clush___: is this gingi leak real
[7:21:01] otigrudo: Just eyebean the mobs irl 5head

[7:21:33] chalupascript: 200 ping is cringe but u have to try it yourself and judge it

[7:21:59] Clush___: firstGarf
[7:22:02] suinetel: @miiloswow Yeah noticed that too. Pinging incorporeal I am hibernating even make people mad. It seems like pinging is equal to honking while driving. It depends on people/culture how they see pinging. Ofc the pinging is also 1 more "sound alert".
[7:22:09] bluhblaah: @zuzua90 VPN should make that number go down by a large amount
[7:22:09] imawoooga: 200 aussie ping is different than 200 us ping
[7:22:32] Yuccalyptus: I've been playing with divinefield lately and he has been playing from EU and sometimes it's unplayable but sometimes it's smooth sailing
[7:22:35] Thowarr: It's reverse ping, like the toilets
[7:22:48] zuzua90: @bluhblaah I was just posting what the other guy said cx
[7:23:28] zuzua90: ret better than DH now?
[7:23:38] KillchainGames: vpn worth spending the dollars on or get a shitty free one?
[7:24:13] miiloswow: @suinetel  yeah its weird, me personally having that ping as a reminder helps but to each their own i guess
