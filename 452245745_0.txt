[5:55:20] kwlski01: its gg boys snutz is in
[5:55:21] cmarrs619: @thickful I mean the boys would just sit mage and never let him cast gpy,and when big infernals are popped they go to to the pillar if anything. I don‚Äôt think that comp would have beat the boys, at least not with Storm playing it. Maybe other teams could do it but not Storm lol
