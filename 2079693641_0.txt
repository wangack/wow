[0:05:34] nightmxz: The games were great, only thing was the hoolibang liquid series seemed very ping biased?
[0:05:35] nightmoonx11: The Move were so disappointing. Got destroyed by Echo :/
[0:05:38] thepartyzone: liquid clapping cheeks
[0:05:39] wookie_hairy: enjoyed your commentary today ven. games were solid

[0:06:15] TacobellWOW: to think ping is the ONlY factor is hikarious
[0:06:19] TacobellWOW: hilarious*
[0:06:32] dskamin29: do na players have decent ping on eu?
[0:06:40] theodeth: plenty of teams won with bad ping
[0:06:40] dskamin29: cause wouldnt ping even out in that case
[0:07:00] thepartyzone: obviously void lost with the double dh pick .. but it‚Äôs still a viable pick.. I remember the outrage when double outlaw was viable
[0:07:07] leavingnow1: Liquid in with a real chance
[0:07:16] thepartyzone: I hate how many dh there are
[0:07:42] Jun_bug__: the holy priest was on fire tho
[0:07:46] thepartyzone: what was is 400k sweep with 150k anihlates durring same global
[0:07:49] theodeth: liquid won without playing DH so its possible
[0:07:52] nightmxz: Yeah I don't think it was ping only either and it was still a good set, wish there was a better solution
[0:08:06] revid21: Word on the street is @venruki coming out of retirement to join The Move

[0:15:43] crymorre: PepegaAim
[0:15:49] marcjr32: bro took the fulltime caster role literally
[0:16:36] kesharq: What in your opinion do disc priests need? Is it just through put or is mana there biggest issue.
[0:16:37] chartwellk: the move is not done.  let them figure it out, no toxic comments!  already too public
[0:16:39] thepartyzone: do you personally think dh / outlaw / lock need any tuning @venruki

[0:29:15] ozzyxy: any new drama ozzxyzJoshua
[0:29:15] MaximumnNeo: when they won blizzcon sam was playing boom

[0:30:07] spicy_tunax: ven says leave the drama for your mama
[0:30:08] addyz0r: Did your team ever make a precog uptime for sam?
[0:30:11] Promocodebaj: @venruki didn't see much of the tourney. Did Echo play anyone besides the move?
[0:30:16] crymorre: yeah it's some crazy tech
[0:30:25] notdustinx: great casting today broski
[0:30:28] chartwellk: Canadians don‚Äôt do drama LEAVE THE MOVE ALONEEE

[0:31:00] saveslol: liquid vs echo tomorrow is going to be a lot of fun
[0:31:10] trappxy99: do you think the move is holding themselves back by refusing to play any other comp?
[0:31:13] addyz0r: I can't wait for game night
[0:31:45] Promocodebaj: what happened to Kawhi? before I stopped watching for a long time, they were dominating
[0:31:55] Lurn: pika the 1 trick rogue madge
[0:32:00] EarlessWhale: @venruki Do you think AWC will ever go to live event?
[0:32:07] 2morebeers: their comp is the least of their worries rn
[0:32:08] nameyourform: liquid is looking hottttt
[0:32:48] addyz0r: Raiku was crying within 1min of one game xD was kinda funny
[0:32:57] chartwellk: need more viewership and we all have to band together to promote the AWC
[0:33:07] gaulois62: if i did not play since season 2 do i need to recraft all my embelishement gear from the start^
[0:33:13] Vynarian: Are all the games played on NA?
[0:33:16] addyz0r: Yeah we all get it. It is what it is
[0:33:19] th0ughtless: I'm happy to see Pika in global tourneys doing well - he's a trouper
[0:33:25] addyz0r: we can't lan so they tried this format
[0:33:32] sllvrbck: absolutely. there is nothing more wow can do besides a LAN
[0:33:33] nameyourform: i just dont understand why he was crying so much when his team was winning with NA ping
[0:33:34] lilcoooooom: activision wants everyone at home LAN is bad for buisness
[0:33:41] addyz0r: it's awesome to see eu vs na
[0:33:48] JustTaki: there were a few wins on low ping today right?
[0:33:57] 2morebeers: have you tried "liquid death" i just purchased a box and not gonna lie the water taste pretty dang good.
[0:34:34] chartwellk: also right now it‚Äôs majority EU in upper bracket
[0:34:40] addyz0r: i am down for it. It's so fun
[0:34:46] addyz0r: echo vs liquid Pog
[0:34:46] NovaSun84: get some data to understand where we stand today.  SeemsGood
[0:34:49] Bigvuqoffdam: Evening Coffee with Ruki
[0:34:51] EarlessWhale: @venruki I'm convinced live event would bring in so many more viewers to wow pvp in general
[0:35:00] Bigvuqoffdam: GOOD EVENING
[0:35:01] five_moke: what‚Äôs so great about it, it‚Äôs just water unless it‚Äôs flavored?
[0:35:34] 2morebeers: not all waters are created equal
[0:35:34] vilecurse_01: Did you address the move drama yet
[0:35:42] chartwellk: no
[0:35:45] 2morebeers: liquid death
[0:35:51] 2morebeers: thank you
[0:36:03] vilecurse_01: I think jelly quit :(
[0:36:05] 2morebeers: i came here to get away from the dram

[0:36:12] 2morebeers: ty
[0:36:16] chartwellk: HES GONE
[0:36:18] nikthevoker: i want drama!
[0:36:22] TheNutcracka: jelly apparently got "kicked" from the team
[0:36:29] ozzyxy: @venruki zevia made me stop drinking soda.
[0:36:30] addyz0r: i only like mild drama
[0:36:31] sllvrbck: Why not do a setup where the final 2 teams that win their region meet up for ‚ÄúSuper Bowl‚Äù but make it best of 5 total series wins to make it last longer
[0:36:31] aaggros: Ven, do you know if Victoria is nice to visit?  The wife wants me to take her there for bday.
[0:36:53] Bigvuqoffdam: Venruki quit Bring It
[0:36:56] vilecurse_01: Yeah pika was saying something about jelly not being on the team anymore
[0:36:58] th0ughtless: The weird thing, from my and I'm sure a lot of peoples perspectives, it's not drama - it's just life and it's just how you deal with things when there's friction between human beings
[0:36:59] chartwellk: I‚Äôm in Vancouver, will vouch for Victoria
[0:37:08] chartwellk: take a sea plane!
[0:37:11] 2morebeers: do you think they will do any more balance updates before season end? or are they just invested completly on SoD rn?
[0:37:39] vilecurse_01: Love all those guys, sucks to hear
[0:37:47] nikthevoker: gaslighting
[0:37:50] Acurarx: since you play both spriest and lock, which dispel protection do you think is better since healers just dispel anyway.
[0:37:57] SithLordBob: who owns "The Move" ?
[0:38:01] addyz0r: parasocial behavior
[0:38:10] lilcoooooom: ima shia lebouf super fan
[0:38:25] chartwellk: cdew owns the move
[0:38:31] chartwellk: and he got kicked out today
[0:38:51] aaggros: What are you guys talking about?
[0:39:03] nikthevoker: i beat shuffle, just sitting n long ass queue now LUL
[0:40:51] raeza444: am i going crazy is it me or the music has some crazy pitch shifting happening to it

[0:53:43] SteLawBro: @lophtxd Ah, didnt know he was fighting it. Hope the facts come out.
[0:53:45] Acurarx: since you play both spriest and lock, which dispel protection do you think is better since healers just dispel anyway?
[0:53:52] lophtxd: i'm also, not picking sides but for him to after her for damages he has to be confident (factual) right?
[0:53:54] Thoreya: crazy shit
[0:54:12] tmk1t: I'll put it this way: you don't counter-sue or go to court unless you have at leeast SOME evidence to show yourr innocence
[0:54:16] crymorre: HamJam

[1:09:08] euphoriaxlol: if ur a mage irl, what spec you going?
[1:09:12] Mhortai: My predication is it will be Liquid and Echo in the finals tomorrow.
[1:09:17] lophtxd: arcane
[1:09:35] Vigi9413: have you seen the videos about The Move and Jelly? or you‚Äôre just kinda not care if so sorry for asking!
[1:09:41] americanmoses18: trading post this month got some good rewards
[1:09:43] th0ughtless: @Kilerz yeah - we get the warmness of African weather, and in the north west of EU the Atlantic currents from the caribean warm the weather
[1:09:44] wowsuomi: Fire
[1:09:47] Vigi9413: his stream
[1:10:02] Vigi9413: he streamed at the start of AWC

[1:10:24] lophtxd: what happened with the move?
[1:10:26] americanmoses18: so no 4th for them rn
[1:11:12] Vigi9413: I agree.. they should just talk about it
[1:11:23] Wrathbb1: and there might be ALOT more going on than anyone feels like sharing "with the class" as it were
[1:11:24] americanmoses18: transormers music bossing rn

[1:12:10] Magottx: Hey buddy super hype games today
[1:12:14] americanmoses18: hoolibang is fun af to watch
[1:12:37] Magottx: Yea your lighting looks diff today.
[1:12:40] TY_Dunston: you do look tanned now that they sat
[1:12:40] doclovejr: liquid vs echo is fucking CHEF'S KISS
[1:12:41] th0ughtless: but isn't it great that a 20+ year old game continues to entertain
[1:12:42] Vigi9413: hoolibang is really fun
[1:12:43] TY_Dunston: say
[1:13:04] tmk1t: Hoolibang pushing Liquid to the limit just shows how insane they are. Liquid looked insanely comfortable against their next opponent
[1:13:06] lophtxd: what in ears do you use?
[1:13:07] addyz0r: I liked the brown ruki
[1:13:18] Mhortai: I know the ping isn't ideal. But it's still  A LOT of money to compete for. Hopefully LANS come back. That is what I hope for. But I have loved this mid season tourney so far.
[1:13:25] freyjiiaa: love the decor on your wall :D
[1:13:35] Magottx: after NA lost first 2 and liquid came out hot first game i was so happy lol
[1:13:37] americanmoses18: sam even tweeted they never practiced for hoolibangs comp
[1:13:55] Vigi9413: you can tell that Liquid have such a great like knowing of how each other plays
[1:14:13] addyz0r: I've lived here for four years and have nothing on the wall xD'
[1:14:18] addyz0r: i'm such a bum
[1:14:22] Mhortai: Is Liquid at Cdews house or are they at a Liquid facility of some kind?
[1:14:23] freyjiiaa: xD
[1:14:33] williwhite94: @addyz0r i dont have a girlfreind either LOL
[1:14:39] PunishedLrnz: displate is also pretty cool but, sliiiiiiiightly expensive
[1:14:40] Vigi9413: they‚Äôre boot camping together I think at the liquid place
[1:14:50] Magottx: Dont you think chan and raiku could play Mage Lock and out dampen anyone?
[1:14:57] addyz0r: yeah i try to. I have 3 paintings stacked like yours :D
[1:15:14] katastropheexdee: that is a very scrumptios loooking lock right there
[1:15:14] Magottx: shiet
[1:15:33] Magottx: omg that reminds me of trill live lord parkouring around at 1 hp to live was so sick
[1:15:39] gaulois62: love that music
[1:15:44] tmk1t: idk, destro lock waas played in a ton of games today
[1:15:48] gaulois62: good movie too
[1:15:51] th0ughtless: ven, what makes the difference between a pro and great player in wow?
[1:15:54] Vigi9413: trill is unfairly good at the game
[1:15:58] Landrysdad: what is the best triple dps comp to ruin rshams in cata?
[1:16:00] ogdmt: its on peacock i believe
[1:16:07] tmk1t: Oppenheimer was my favorite movie of 2023
[1:16:09] addyz0r: Me too. It's on my list with upcoming movies
[1:16:14] Mr_Irrelevant222: Dude Oppenheimer is 10/10
[1:16:19] tmk1t: @venruki OHHHH gotchya
[1:16:21] Mr_Irrelevant222: Soooooo good
[1:16:34] volbyz: @Landrysdad funny enough triple dps was what kept rshams in check. rogue teams, dks, etc
[1:16:41] americanmoses18: just saw dune part 2 also 10/10
[1:16:44] americanmoses18: peak cinema
[1:16:45] gaulois62: The second time u watch it is much better!
[1:16:47] Vigi9413: it‚Äôs on peacock currently
[1:16:53] Spaceberry_McDuck: i saw dune 2 today
[1:16:57] addyz0r: i'm watching peaky blinders. Cillean carrying that series
[1:16:59] euphoriaxlol: dune 2 was so good
[1:17:00] tmk1t: RDJ is actually INSANE in that movie

[1:17:20] JarJar_Brinkz: Oh snap, sweet
[1:17:26] Spaceberry_McDuck: @th0ughtless dune 2 was wonderful however i am heavily biased because i've read the books a few times
[1:17:27] jporter_: my fiance and i went there this summer, it was amazing
[1:17:27] tmk1t: @addyz0r THE PEAKY FOOOOKIN BLINDAHS
[1:17:28] americanmoses18: the dune trilogy is going to go down as like the new lord of the rings and star wars in terms of amazing cinema
[1:17:28] addyz0r: Cool
[1:17:29] euphoriaxlol: Bellissimo bellissimo
[1:17:30] leeka: a week? what are we suppose to do for a week?
[1:17:35] jay_deetv: oh snap, honeymooning in italy in a week for 10 days
[1:17:37] Magottx: a week!? bruh
[1:17:44] jay_deetv: IRL meetup??? Kappa
[1:17:45] JarJar_Brinkz: Eat pizza clearly Kappa
[1:17:49] addyz0r: wow addiction is gonna go hard xD
[1:17:51] wyldeshock: @leeka right?
[1:17:56] tmk1t: @americanmoses18 don't think that can ever happen given their lead actor is a spoiled child that can't act
[1:17:58] Vigi9413: you mean I have to watch other streams?
[1:17:59] Magottx: that sounds so fun. happy for you guys. i want to go someday
[1:17:59] th0ughtless: @Spaceberry_McDuck I hear you, glad you enjoyed it I think it's sooo much better than the previous tv series
[1:18:07] MaximumnNeo: florence is amazing
[1:18:08] Mr_Irrelevant222: Venruki & Supatease honeymooning in Italy for 10 days?! EPIC!!!
[1:18:09] jporter_: florence was super cool, theyre famous for their wild boar and it was amazing
[1:18:23] shawdowfax77: whoa its late why is he on?
[1:18:28] Spaceberry_McDuck: @th0ughtless that tv series was the best adaptation of dune until this. it wasnt bad but it clearly didnt have a budget
[1:18:31] jay_deetv: Vacationing hurts streamers more than most other professions I think though no?
[1:18:32] Magottx: same. like very hard. like dont even go out with friends cause it might effect training the day of or after
[1:18:33] TY_Dunston: i use to live in Italy for 3 years i loved it
[1:18:40] wyldeshock: guys we can watch vods it‚Äôs fine
[1:18:47] jporter_: wait no its tuscany. florence was steak
[1:18:48] JarJar_Brinkz: Wild boar Kappa tastes like regular pig Kappa But don't tell the tourists that
[1:19:10] Magottx: @JarJar_Brinkz i heard thats not true at all? lol could be wrong tho
[1:19:20] JarJar_Brinkz: @Magottx Its not, im just meming LUL
[1:19:37] Magottx: lol yea i heard its way different
[1:19:37] Wrathbb1: wild boar tastes like pig that eats pig
[1:19:39] Wrathbb1: cause it is
[1:19:42] th0ughtless: @Spaceberry_McDuck yep, it's also really hard to adapt very expansive sci-fi to the screen. Viileneuve made the point that he didn't think dialogue was important - it needs to be visually special
[1:19:51] Magottx: its better or worse? or just different entirely
[1:19:55] JarJar_Brinkz: Its game animal so it has a diff taste, but similar
[1:20:11] Shirey12: Enjoyed you and Ziqo today <3
[1:20:28] Wrathbb1: i mean if you aren't bbq'ing it for 24 hrs in crazy sauce its not even wild boar so its not like you are eating plain ass porkchops and really tasting the meat
[1:20:34] addyz0r: oblivian and gate not found
[1:21:14] metanymical: metanymical subscribed with Prime. 
[1:21:15] Moobot: rukiCool rukiBuddy rukiBuddy rukiBuddy rukiBuddy metanymical WELCOME TO THE BUDDY CLUB! rukiBuddy rukiBuddy rukiBuddy rukiBuddy rukiBuddy rukiCool
[1:21:18] Spaceberry_McDuck: @th0ughtless yea, that's my biggest gripe with it. certain scenes were important because of the dialog in the book, and it didn't carry over to the film. however, nothing is ever perfect and i still love the movie
[1:21:32] gh0sstm4n: Ven who do you think is going to take the midseason clash
[1:21:43] lophtxd: probs knows its you
[1:21:45] lophtxd: wants clout
[1:21:55] lophtxd: well, knows youre streaming
[1:22:02] addyz0r: got smxecuted too many times and is but hurt
[1:22:11] bbq_sauceman: mad at something in game when its really something irl ya kno
[1:22:17] metanymical: That sub was a thank you for your YouTube video, "How To NEVER DIE As A Mage In Dragonflight PvP (KITING + MOBILITY GUIDE)", by the way.

[1:24:46] Magottx: Would you ever learn league to open up more casting opportunities Ven? i think you should youre so good at it.
[1:24:54] Shirey12: I am so pumped to read Soul Harvester. I really hope its great for Aff. Best spec in my opinion.

[2:03:17] ripinpeace10: do you think awc is why were not getting balance changes? i feel like its rlly bad to balance the game around 1% of pvpers that compete. @venruki
[2:03:46] Spaede: its the most balanced its been in years
[2:04:38] schwammgurke: nerf dh and im good

[2:05:41] afk_rudy: bro you seen the changes for SoD???
[2:05:45] jasuvex: balancing the game from the top is good, but they are not even doing that...they are doing nothing
[2:05:47] afk_rudy: that is what we want in Retail
[2:05:55] Snohconez: why not just a separate server
[2:07:21] ripinpeace10: in legion when we were geting changes every other week it felt the best ever fresh meta every month. balancing the game around awc is purely bad
[2:08:00] rohmantv: how are u still pumpin after calling all those games td u must be exhausted
[2:08:07] eygton: Gulp gulp gulp
[2:08:18] eygton: love your casting

[2:08:32] Spaede: i dont know how you do it man. Im on zoom for a few hours a day presenting and i get wiped
[2:08:34] ripinpeace10: hopefully some changes coming this week
[2:08:38] jasuvex: @ripinpeace10 but they are not balancing the game around awc...they are probably not doing changes cause of awc...but if they at least "balanced" it around awc would be fine

[2:10:50] leeka: @mudcx :( i dont even login anymore
[2:10:51] eygton: no
[2:10:53] mudcx: ive been grinding but nobody wants to q with a warrior because every warrior cleave is just a worse version of some dh or ret comp
[2:11:05] SweatyDaniels: instead of a 4th mage, have you considered making a 2nd DH?

[2:12:02] nerd_puncher: jk theyll just insta fotm
[2:12:15] eygton: I bet you haven‚Äôt seen a rated group game in a while huh @jasuvex
[2:12:17] mudcx: @jasuvex both feral and war are pretty garbage, dh takes our comps. But DH war is worse ret dh and fist ret war isnt as good as people think it is.
[2:12:24] mudcx: Either way ret war fist is cringe i dont want to q it
[2:12:25] SteLawBro: I want to see someone multibox 35 dh's and 5 druids and take a city hostage.
[2:12:30] metanymical: Is there a way to see what music tracks are playing?
[2:13:23] jasuvex: @mudcx word...ye ret/war/fist is incredibly braindead, thats how all 2.5 randos got r1...u have 75 oh shit lifesavers...
[2:13:42] mairelaflare: is fire mage top mage spec @venruki
[2:13:47] ripinpeace10: theres no world where anyone in their right mind would take a dk feral or war over a ww/dh dh being the obv favorite
[2:13:55] ripinpeace10: i should say should take*
[2:14:05] ripinpeace10: or ret pally too
[2:14:07] mudcx: @jasuvex ret war fist is the most boring warrior comp and we're on season 8 of ret war being the best war comp
[2:14:12] Trix_x: dannycarry loves the shuffs
[2:14:24] dakila24: finally broke 2500 in shuff on my frost mage for the season earlier, it's a wild string of lobbies out there
[2:14:41] mudcx: yo ven work your magic and get arms buffs EZ
[2:14:51] Magottx: Mud. i'd que with you :)  just tank like 1k rating and we'll be good
[2:14:53] jporter_: ive been loving demo again
[2:14:55] jasuvex: @mudcx amount of ppl that were never above 2.5 before ret/war/fist was a thing...its kinda sad ur right that thats the best warr comp

[2:15:22] Extramediums: arms just upset they aren't dh
[2:15:27] mudcx: you're right tho
[2:15:28] jasuvex: arms would be fine if DH got nerfed, just like many other specs
[2:15:28] mudcx: its hard to tell
[2:15:30] mudcx: cuz dh is cooked
[2:15:33] mudcx: and takes our comps
[2:15:40] ripinpeace10: Id like blizz to give hpal sacred shield back 50% beacon and 20% buff to WoG healing
[2:15:45] jasuvex: DH just gimping half the comps/specs, making them garbage
[2:15:48] ripinpeace10: then i think hpal is competive
[2:15:54] Borngood: LMAO
[2:15:59] SteLawBro: @mudcx Nobody ever said the life of a warrior was an easy one. Its what you signed up for. But imagine how much stronger youll be in the end...Or crazy üò¨
[2:16:03] Sneakstyle: bro is this last samurai music?

[2:18:22] ripinpeace10: @venruki no troll tho hpal is obv not in a good spot what would you change or buff? sacred shield would help with healing while cc'ed
[2:18:23] nightmxz: Frost mage should play a bit more like destro lock but more mobile and aggro

[2:19:02] ripinpeace10: doesnt even break fear anymore
[2:19:16] jfachal: I don‚Äôt understand how DH has not been nerfed
