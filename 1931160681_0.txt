[5:14:32] tlsmith3638: Do they have a usb version of them I been looking for a new headset for work
[5:15:02] hateful88: $200 is about the average for a GOOD headset. They are cheaper than my Corsair wireless Virtuoso XT’s and those are bangers
[5:15:13] HawtPepperTuna: ain't nobody got time for batteries
[5:15:14] Sollice: I think you can get a 3.5mm to USB adapter but you really wouldn't want to do that
[5:15:40] Sollice: Or you can get a small $40 DAC
[5:15:55] CultistSam: How come you deleted that cryptic vanilla wow tweet? hmmmmm fraggySmog
[5:16:18] Sollice: They wouldn't unless you cget a DAC which is what I use

[5:24:31] Sollice: @JQ47 Yes it does
[5:24:38] N3llee: i had the astro's 40's wireless forever and i loved them .. best headset ever. They stopped making the 40s and the new model 50s were just trash in my opinion.
[5:24:42] JQ47: Ty
[5:25:04] wEiRdO_dUdE: It has a mic you can plug into the line
[5:25:07] Sollice: I always thought Astros were way too expensive for what they were.
[5:25:09] DunzoCD: ite you sold me on them Towelliee, my old arctis 7's dont hold a charge much anymore so i needed a new headset anyways
[5:25:23] Sollice: Yeah mic quality is not bad at all
[5:25:31] andy_4000: i got an overpowered setup just for discord lol

[5:27:22] JQ47: I will say depending on where you live I got a big standing desk used for 200 on FB marketplace
[5:27:37] wEiRdO_dUdE: That is a debounce delay
[5:27:39] Sollice: Lowers latency
[5:28:03] wEiRdO_dUdE: Usually you don't need it on unless you ever have it double tap, like with keyboards
[5:28:08] TacDuc: @Sollice Just got a 1440p 240Hz OLED monitor, it is amazing, it looks amazing and feels so responsive, definitely can recommend it
[5:28:24] andy_4000: my dad built my desk it's a nice butcher block long countertop from home depot and and some nice legs and an alex drawer was about 700$
[5:28:25] Sollice: @TacDuc Yeah Katie and I use LGC2s. OLED is great.
[5:28:42] wEiRdO_dUdE: Keeping the delay off makes it more responsive, but having that extra delay can keep super fast key pushes from registering too many times
[5:28:54] andy_4000: yea my dad is very handy
[5:29:14] Sollice: The IKEA Alex hack
[5:29:57] wEiRdO_dUdE: The "power saving mode" drops the polling rate a bunch, I had to look that one up, and generally you want to leave that off too for less latency

[6:54:29] mavericks312: ashoka maybe the bst star wars show ngl
[6:55:05] N3llee: yea thought the same... been ok but its not blowing my socks off like Andor
[6:55:06] Darthyrevan: truth.com
[6:55:14] andy_4000: its for the hardcore fans of star wars in my opinion i love it
[6:55:47] mavericks312: @N3llee see thats how i feel about andor like it didnt really impress me
[6:56:14] N3llee: @andy_requis as a HC fan arent you worried they are about to ret-con all the force light/dark side back stories?
[6:56:15] andy_4000: yea
[6:56:16] mavericks312: did you ever watch clone wars?
[6:56:17] robbo1010: Need to have watched Rebels and Clone Wars which are both amazing
[6:56:22] andy_4000: you kinda have to know
[6:56:31] Sollice: god damn I am getting all kinds of purples in New World
[6:56:37] archninja64: Andor was just fine for me, I’m liking Ahsoka way more.  Part of that is rebels and clone wars were great too so it feeds into ot
[6:56:45] bubbles1489: I just wated this weeks episode last night. im really interested to see where it goes next week
[6:56:54] Howitzer1028: Yea my wife hadn’t watched anything regarding Ahsoka, she’s been bored almost the whole time
[6:56:57] andy_4000: @N3llee no not really i'm kinda just rolling with daves ideas
[6:57:01] mavericks312: @archninja64 i feel andor is highly overhyped
[6:57:06] silentscope60: it has been hard for me to get into any of these stand alones
[6:57:19] Snabido: I let my youtube algo catch me up on backstories, unintentionally KEKW

[6:57:53] Thralazaar: first season was great
[6:57:56] N3llee: @andy_requis bunch of fan theories that Dave joined team Kennedy and might be ret-con the entire back story of the force with these witch sisters
[6:57:57] archninja64: @mavericks312 yeah I think it was good, but I wouldn’t give it more than 7/10 but it’s more a 6 or so.  Ashoka is on track to be a solid 8-9 depending how it ends
[6:58:04] andy_4000: loki is like the only show i like from marvel
[6:58:19] TexValhalla: Towelliee you doin a streamathon or somethin for New World? any secret announcements they made toi y'all that you can't say yet? hmmm?
[6:58:26] essadis: is MK1 playthru on the radar?
[6:58:30] mavericks312: @archninja64 oh 100% ashoka is def the better show
[6:58:33] Howitzer1028: Watching cars 2 prior to Loki is helpful, then you understand why that guy says Ka-chow so much
[6:58:44] patti221: careful of those damned tunnel rats
[6:58:50] andy_4000: @N3llee i mean i hope so they the dathomir people were the originals

[7:00:28] TexValhalla: october 6
[7:00:33] N3llee: with the strike i doubt anything happens soon
[7:00:33] archninja64: @mavericks312 filoni should be head of Star Wars.  It clearly shows he knows what makes it good
[7:00:41] Howitzer1028: What are you hoping to see in the new expansion? Just a Hail Mary dream idea that they announce with it
[7:00:42] TexValhalla: ye
[7:00:50] andy_4000: @N3llee if you read books you would know dave is trying to make it more on that side of canon not so much of the skywalker era
[7:01:19] wEiRdO_dUdE: I think I'm sticking with greatsword mostly, but I'll try the flail

[7:08:41] wEiRdO_dUdE: Updated graphics for the old world would be nice
[7:08:44] N3llee: didnt Ion say in a interview they were looking at repairing some of the old zonez from cata?
[7:08:56] Howitzer1028: I’d like a more streamlined leveling experience, leveling in BFA for new players I don’t think fits anymore
[7:09:35] N3llee: o yea i dont think there will be a entire world redo but maybe some repair efforts on the cata dmg'd zones and the giant sword removal
[7:10:18] mavericks312: and also BFA is a better xpac to level in the S-lands lol

[7:12:20] Howitzer1028: If people want long leveling just play classic. We have both right now just enjoy having the option
[7:12:37] TexValhalla: it's an mmo, everyone cares about endgame grind. slow leveling in an mmo as old as WoW is pretty bad

[7:15:15] TexValhalla: towelliee doing lore videos would be so great LUL
[7:15:25] Wcvechten: Could add in Storytellers in major cities for people to interact with that just explain the stories for those interested I guess? condensed and all
[7:15:36] Dadricwraith: lamo
[7:15:39] Soobaaroo: @Howitzer1028 they kind of did with that questline in ardenweld when you did the play
[7:15:42] xendros78: LUL the lore sounds even worse when you try to explain it

[7:16:41] Akermay: Just make players play every expac in order for 500 hours, easy, then it makes sense LUL
[7:16:58] CloudPants8081: where pandaria at KEKW
[7:17:07] DunzoCD: if you ask chromie about Shadowlands she should say "I have no memory of such a place"
[7:17:15] raldrik: So basically the Night Fae storyline :)

[7:18:46] PokerFaceMoose: some stuff in the wow lore is only in books too right?
[7:19:03] snake_like: if they make an in-game lore journal or make the story more approachable they have to admit the lore has been retconned and pissed on by multiple parties over the years

[7:30:31] wEiRdO_dUdE: Yeah being on the game pass doesn't mean everything is free, it's just access to play the game
[7:31:32] Howitzer1028: I could see them giving a free “trial” month with gamepass, help get people in the door but that’s it
[7:31:41] abracka_: soon stormblood
[7:31:46] Gungre: Stormblood soon
[7:31:58] abracka_: heavensward rn, first xpac, then stormblood is next for the free trial
[7:32:00] Mostdangspy: Even Everquest has a free to play
[7:32:10] wEiRdO_dUdE: They definitely could bump up that up from 1-20 to 1-50
[7:32:28] Howitzer1028: 10 minutes of play time to hit 20 and have no idea what’s happening, perfect trial system
[7:32:31] Stixxerz: even if wow went F2P i would still take my subscribtion
[7:32:38] eldritchcoffee: hi all
[7:32:50] Zelium6: when do ptr M+ come back up?
[7:33:15] SoulSlayer088: i would pay for a auto-loot pet
[7:33:22] belfastcl: what if they made the pre-expansion level cap a buy to play / game pass thing
[7:33:27] Zelium6: yeah there are no dungeons right now

[7:33:39] Plague_GG: i think increasing the trial to 50 would be fine, let ppl play through BFA
[7:34:19] Wcvechten: Let them play all content upto SL, because nobody should be subject to SL content
[7:34:23] Nerendis: Isn't BFA the "base" game now. As in that's where lore starts for new players and such
[7:34:42] tangalious: tangalious subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 25 months! 
[7:34:49] N3llee: Okay.. so lets say they dont add WoW to game pass. We know the leak docs suggested Phil's end game goal is 100mill Game Pass Subs. What do they add?
[7:35:05] Gungre: These mounts do not fucking exist
[7:35:05] wEiRdO_dUdE: I think BFA should be the new base game for awhile, pretty much
[7:35:14] tangalious: It is just sounded like it is tangy
[7:35:17] Keyastaron_: mount inc?
[7:35:26] N3llee: no put it would add to that total
[7:35:30] Howitzer1028: You can add the entirety of blizzards library, but adding WoW is not gonna happen
[7:35:31] N3llee: 100m is their goal
[7:35:32] dschmidt: @N3llee they were banking on Starfield

[7:36:10] mavericks312: make better games like starfield maybe
[7:36:17] wEiRdO_dUdE: Do they really have to give up the WoW token to be on Game Pass? Maybe they just have to allow it
[7:36:21] Sicknessqt: Call of duty would get them insane numbers
[7:36:22] Keyastaron_: @Towelliee  there should be a new mount ?
[7:36:23] justagamingfiend: include ad Netflix
[7:36:27] Howitzer1028: Add diablo 4, that makes money from seasons and cosmetics anyway
[7:36:32] mukulukku: it's not just the trial, I think new players to retail wow must be very overwhelmed by all the content and possibilities
[7:37:00] whitennerdy: I just grouped with Towellie :)
[7:37:03] mavericks312: @Howitzer1028 unless there is a season like season 1 an its horrible
[7:37:11] whitennerdy: I think.  Was he just on his monk?
[7:37:15] houseofficer1: wouldnt mind slightly more horizontal progression and less vertical
[7:37:25] whitennerdy: <3
[7:37:34] whitennerdy: ty for the carry
[7:37:37] Keyastaron_: there should be a way to have people who want to play the expac from start to finish and cant go onto the next expac until the final quest / boss is completed LUL
[7:37:40] abracka_: drop the animated netflix series for the events that started and led up to arthas dying

[7:38:08] wEiRdO_dUdE: Horizontal progression can be alts, and I think there is room for more of that
[7:38:26] Howitzer1028: Here’s the new leveling experience: you launch WoW, @towelliee appears on screen, he talks for 20 hours about what’s happened in WoW using his own words, you are level 60 when it’s over
[7:38:46] PokerFaceMoose: vertical is becoming explicitly more powerful. horizontal is progressing in other ways. getting new transmogs, improving stuff that is not power like unlocking new dragonriding moves

[7:38:52] houseofficer1: make raid rewards cosmetic rather than ilvl or point system or anything other than having to grind gear every few months

[7:39:52] Korupcija_: I would quit KEKW
[7:39:55] PokerFaceMoose: there is a lot of both in WoW. other games are more focused on just horizontal. like GW2. you can get the good gear fast then boom you are strong as anyone

[9:03:31] wEiRdO_dUdE: I remember one time years back I was leveling a prot warrior in PvP and the shield slams were destroying people, felt awesome
[9:04:23] Cryonixia: With my build on the Warrior tank it was broken with last weeks set bonus. Un-killable and way too much damage. Lol Pretty much back to Gladiator days. We could use a bit more love in the balancing department. The new changes are looking pretty decent however, can't wait to see them.

[9:06:10] wEiRdO_dUdE: Prot warrior needs to be doing good damage in 10.2 because it has been falling behind the other tanks
[9:06:46] wEiRdO_dUdE: THose bear mauls are still freakish damage
[9:07:02] WaverlyP15: @wEiRdO_dUdE Tru, I always play hella defensive but it was bad this tier ST wise
