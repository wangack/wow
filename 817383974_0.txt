[1:17:40] 1chillpill: this one is pretty easy
[1:17:44] aksel______: need to click flowers
[1:17:57] Redn3ckHippie: there are stalks you have to stand on 5 of them\
[1:17:58] aksel______: they are called lunar buds
[1:17:59] 1chillpill: no need to click just walk over them
[1:17:59] doxxee: just run over all the flowers in a circle around it
[1:18:00] FatChase: You don't need to click, just walk over them

[1:18:23] Mightbeworth: which cov. do you think benefits dk the most for all 3 specs?
[1:18:40] kharditv: @mightbeworth ask Luxthos please
[1:18:42] Dalrend7640: lunarlight pod i think
[1:18:46] doxxee: it will say "dim" if it's not activated yet
[1:18:54] Ziephier: getting World Server down message
[1:18:55] noxitall: You just have to run thu 5 of those lunarlight flowers and then you will be able to open it @Towelliee
[1:19:00] 1chillpill: ye, they are 5 around the thing, not far
[1:19:19] mysteriousm4n: I'm running maldraxxus on my dk and nobody can tell me otherwise
[1:19:22] Vexnya: @mightbeworth I think night fae is the most well rounded if you intend to swap specs a lot, but that is purely based on what little I know about the dk stuff, wow head has guides written for more in depth stuff
[1:19:24] TeamKilld: is SL stuff loading for u
[1:19:26] TheDumbGoose: wich covenant is best for destro in ur opinion

[1:19:55] TeamKilld: whast the best for frost mage ??
[1:20:31] doxxee: venthyr for frost mage
[1:20:40] squeekumzz: 5
[1:20:48] Dalrend7640: they gonna nerf that harvest chain BS
[1:20:49] TeamKilld: ok im super new thaks for help
[1:20:49] FatChase: Need 5 in total
[1:20:50] Vexnya: @TeamKilld for frost mage solely, venthyr seems to be the best single target, if you swap specs often, night fae is the most well rounded and its BiS for arcane/fire
[1:20:51] wastedx3149: NF is the juice for arcane
[1:20:59] iPell: Looking good these days @Towelliee
[1:21:03] turbo16: Witch is best for afflic warlock

[1:21:35] turbo16: Thanks
[1:21:36] Vexnya: @Graithan34 liek the fox thing? yeah I am pretty sure it is
[1:21:40] doxxee: i think they're all in line of sight
[1:21:44] Maydie6066: @Dalrend7640 no they wont, its a long cast, its kickable. shamans need that
[1:21:56] tecnobrat: server just lagged out completely doing flappy bird
[1:21:57] Stay__Off__My__Lawn: 2 are near the flight path - one kind of center, the other across and on a table
[1:21:59] tecnobrat: gonna be a good day...
[1:21:59] Dalrend7640: they will either nerf it, or bring the other abilities up to be the same damage wise
[1:22:02] TheDumbGoose: what covenant is best for demo lock ?
[1:22:05] mysteriousm4n: my character is on top of the portal to torghast but won't load, I close and restart game, get back into character, insta hit the portal and get stuck again
[1:22:06] mysteriousm4n: fuck
[1:22:08] Cookiedropz: yep haste and mastery, that is what im focusing on with my destruction lock and it smacks

[1:22:40] luke8810: who this guy
[1:22:41] 1chillpill: LUL
[1:22:42] Vexnya: it is much more likely they will buff covenants, I would hope they would be reserved about nerfs because people have to invest in covenants
[1:22:43] Coobsey: haven't watched towelliee in a while and did not expect you to have such a nice tan. looks good on you.

[19:47:40] sus_callmejezus: brissett was my highschool QB
[19:47:43] 1CooKiee1: how do i get that battle net theme?
[19:47:50] CuresEighty: everything tbh, its fantastic
[19:47:51] RPGSauce: its a great game
[19:47:53] deathlady391: No AP farming!
[19:47:54] Flyingmeat: missing content for grinding tbh
[19:47:55] RPGSauce: great expansion
[19:47:57] KingSlayerYotam: its good but theres so much to do
[19:47:59] wetmeaty: so far so good
[19:48:00] Lekkyx: I'm enjoying pretty much all of it
[19:48:01] Cryttan: the PvP
[19:48:03] Necrocleaver: world of disney
[19:48:04] Creesy69: amazing so far but the maw makes me want to hurt myself irl
[19:48:04] dracullus: there is some bitching here and there
[19:48:04] ShadyWizWolf: Music, questing, cinematics, artwork.
[19:48:04] Ryan_yep: the pace. dont have to grind world quests
[19:48:05] cruzeal: i only like torghast
[19:48:07] Todmeister9000: I like the stories in each zone
[19:48:08] Cacos: I think it's done for filthy casuals like me. Still level 59.
[19:48:08] AnimusEdo: Covenant fantasy is awesome
[19:48:09] Cedistry: so far one of the best expansion starts i ever played
[19:48:09] usagipurin: I like it , its refreshingly different, and no goddamn magni!
[19:48:10] ShadyWizWolf: Pretty much everything.
[19:48:11] Eternaalll: wasn't a fan of lvling experience and how overtuned some content is,other than that was decent
[19:48:11] MetalManGG: i'm enjoying it, but it's annoying that I had to reroll from my DH
[19:48:12] Cryttan: it's still a farmfest
[19:48:12] CDubTheRIPper: im loving SL
[19:48:13] Tyresias: loving it so much

[19:48:17] grizzlyhorn: everyone is shilling now! Kappa
[19:48:17] Givin: I could have done with half the systems
[19:48:18] AthenaP47: i liked the story campagin, i like that there's weekly caps so you don't have to grind, even leveling professions isn't too bad
[19:48:19] mulkon: @Towelliee Why do some people hate Tom Brady? we brazillians know him because he is married to Giselle but I dont know why anyone would hate on him, dispite him being a champion
[19:48:19] trias90_: best staring experience in awhwille
[19:48:20] Cryttan: but you get to chose what you farm
[19:48:21] ShadyWizWolf: 🦀 No More Magni 🦀
[19:48:21] Noxongaming: I think the lvling was abit to fast, since you dont discovery the whole zones and there is alot of quests left when you hit 60 if you only do campain
[19:48:21] Damingo54: Feels good having everything done for the week a few days in and im just able to chill and bg and play with freinds now @Towelliee
[19:48:22] stallowned: i like all the new zones, look very good
[19:48:23] OssewTV: Ability to play Alts
[19:48:23] tronbadgames: @Towelliee best xpac since wotlk
[19:48:23] Sndhelp: loving sl so far. so many good changes
[19:48:24] ShockASU: No real grind you NEED to do. Can do what you want at max level. Dungeons? Dailies? Etc. Go have fun
[19:48:25] Givin: feels like Blizzards Greatest Hits of systems
[19:48:28] erso89: most important is, im having fun, covenats are cool en torghast is fun
[19:48:28] Stormagedden91: Everything to do with the covs
[19:48:32] snake_like: I think it's a good start. the gating is kind of lame, but that's par the course now.
[19:48:32] Wiikz: I like the new gameplay, but the story is kinda weird, even though im not a story guy, and the timegating when you want to change a cov is stupid
[19:48:33] tocu: outside of the poor travel and gys its very good
[19:48:37] Stormagedden91: so interesting and different
[19:48:37] Crosschaser: I had a glance over the forums from blizzard, there's mostly negative remarks there tho, but that seems to be the usual over there
[19:48:39] wetmeaty: 🦀 BFA GONE 🦀
[19:48:41] Lekkyx: Feels kinda like MoP honestly
[19:48:42] Villie: It’s coming off the back of BFA is that not enough
[19:48:44] terrorski: game still kinda sux
[19:48:45] flexgtl23: @Towelliee what are you playing for M raid?
[19:48:45] danksly: ur abilities do what they say on them not has a chance to do X yep
[19:48:47] grumpyunclecritter: is that the Blue X mic ??
[19:48:48] NVbrutal: pretty good start lets just hope they keep it up and it doesnt fall off half way through.
[19:48:50] chadderb0x24: I’m loving the the dungeon layout way more than bfa the story line is great and game feels more interactive
[19:48:52] Necrocleaver: TBC > Shadowlands
[19:48:54] Kanfo: @Towelliee how you get that battle net ?
[19:48:55] predtr_: guys, should i go kyrian or venthyr for mythics?
[19:49:01] Kanfo: Client
[19:49:01] predtr_: as prot pala
[19:49:04] PulsarCologne: I like it cause we can finally kick sylvanas' ass XD
[19:49:08] ryanc1124: Just glad beta for Azeroth is ovah and the real game is out now
[19:49:09] deathlady391: Im just happy its not BFA really
[19:49:12] ShadyWizWolf: Yeah it does. Esp Bastion.
[19:49:13] s1cKNation: do you gonna play the 'new' swtor flashpoint?
[19:49:13] FranciscoTheMage: @Towelliee what is on the worst list. BFA or WOD
[19:49:15] terrorski: @Necrocleaver Grow up
[19:49:17] Wiikz: mop as in mists of pandaria?
[19:49:24] Supers18: @Towelliee everything will be good after BFA
[19:49:25] Dibsy: Reminds me more of TBC than MOP
[19:49:26] Necrocleaver: @terrorski world of diablo andy
[19:49:26] LimmitingZero: the world quests need some work imo, but other than that solid ex pack
[19:49:30] Kanfo: Thanks
[19:49:31] Layercake: Still in the honeymoon time ...let it sink in a few more weeks and you will see the foruns complaining about everything as always lepY
[19:49:38] Odd3ty: what is WA companion?
[19:49:46] Xcernio: I loved MoP and I feel its alot like it aswell. rooHappy
[19:49:53] JustAwaay: maw is great
[19:49:54] 1CooKiee1: maw would be better if they let us mount
[19:49:54] CDubTheRIPper: should get better too
[19:49:54] Creesy69: the maw is so abd imo
[19:49:59] Creesy69: bad*
[19:50:00] AthenaP47: i don't understand why they left the phasing in the maw, it sucks on a low pop server
[19:50:00] boomsitick: The maw is ass, but the rest is so good
[19:50:04] dkwhitegorilla: @Towelliee for me it reminds me of MoP WITH A HINT of wraith of the lich king
[19:50:04] Synthaya: Its so fun tbh
[19:50:06] ShadyWizWolf: I like the Maw tbh. (Worgen main ftw) LUL
[19:50:08] terrorski: @Necrocleaver dont play WoW, but i am top 100 WD in season's in D3. u are correct.
[19:50:09] predtr_: should i go venthir or kyrian for prot pala for mythic dungeons? @Towelliee
[19:50:10] Synthaya: disc priest feels so good
[19:50:12] TeeTreez: loved MoP.. i never understood the hate :'(
[19:50:12] ShockASU: @Towelliee You don't have to go heal out an heal Azeroth's Woooons towLul
[19:50:14] Qoax: I honestly don’t care about all the covenant shit I just want new expansion with permanent new class ability and a good story
[19:50:14] TheFabilolz: Metacritics noted the expension really bad....
[19:50:16] spookyfacegaming: the maw is the weakest point for me for sure
[19:50:16] Jokervenom1978: cant wait for the raid
[19:50:17] grizzlyhorn: dont we get legos next week ?
[19:50:18] deathlady391: Maw would be better if there was more stuff other then doing pretty much your 2 dailies and thats it
[19:50:20] Winkz: yeah not a fan of the maw otherwise pretty solid

[19:50:21] Layercake: Even when there is nothing to complaining people will always find something LUL
[19:50:26] CDubTheRIPper: i wonder when the maw will fully open up
[19:50:29] chadderb0x24: It seemed like they just sped the game up in general and it was much needed
[19:50:32] NethalarTTV: Having Castle Nathria drop right before Cyberpunk is gonna be rough for me
[19:50:36] ShadyWizWolf: @Towelliee Questionnn. Do you think we'll get a Castle raid cinematic?
[19:50:37] CDubTheRIPper: if it does hopefully they give us mounting ability
[19:50:37] DecayedmiNt: @TheFabilolz Imagine taking anything those say as more than a grain of salt.
[19:50:43] 1CooKiee1: maw is absolutely terrible for classes that dont have movement speed buffs
[19:50:43] FranciscoTheMage: @Towelliee what would you have them do in the maw
[19:50:44] awayfromgames: ironic considered it was a big sell point
[19:50:46] qwaade: Just got into Torghast today, having a blast with it, exctited next for it
[19:50:53] Sndhelp: i like the maw. go in do 2 quick daylies and go out
[19:50:56] Osskssa: @criticalkilo everyone lol
[19:50:58] lanara233: I also don't like the Maw
[19:51:01] terrorski: the Maw wasnt like b4
[19:51:01] 1CooKiee1: add mounts to the maw
[19:51:01] mojusk: i like the maw
[19:51:03] th30dor: between ele and enhance, whats the easier leveling / world spec ?
[19:51:10] mojusk: except the walking
[19:51:12] ncatter: hoping the maw is gonna take off at some point, it just needs more of everything to be what they want
[19:51:12] Aphex_fr: mount
[19:51:14] Nehcrom: I like the maw fun stuff.
[19:51:14] CasketFreshx: how tf do you get rid of eye of the jailer threat?
[19:51:15] TheFabilolz: @Synthetiktek i don't, i'm justsaying. I don't give a shit about Metacritics :D
[19:51:19] Aphex_fr: mount is only thing
[19:51:23] JustAwaay: hope they dont
[19:51:27] dkwhitegorilla: @Towelliee get rid of it :P
[19:51:28] NVbrutal: gonna be a good world first race this time around will be interesting to see how method does with the rebuild.
[19:51:31] Creesy69: its too slow
[19:51:31] deathlady391: its great without mounts
[19:51:32] RivalxBishop: Doubt it
[19:51:32] CDubTheRIPper: i mean next patch id be fine with
[19:51:33] ambiotic: i just wish they did mounts and did more of things coming to knock you off it, instead of just banning it totally
[19:51:33] FranciscoTheMage: there are mounts that you can go for.
[19:51:38] terrorski: afteral these years, Why does blizzard still suck ?!
[19:51:38] Jimmo_TV: Druids OP, leave it LUL
[19:51:38] Lekkyx: Maw is like timeless isle fr
[19:51:39] IchabodCrain: it seems like the only reason for the maw to exist is to fund the convenant system, which isn't necessary for character power
[19:51:40] wetmeaty: @reuprx you don't it just does away with time
[19:51:41] ShadyWizWolf: You would think the Jailer would want us to stay in the Maw so he can kill us but no.
[19:51:41] CDubTheRIPper: or whenever they open up the rest of it
[19:51:43] AtriseOW: either mount or some kind of walk speed would be great @Towelliee
[19:51:45] FranciscoTheMage: @Towelliee there are mounts that can be gotten from the rares
[19:51:48] dowden: The Maw will probably change slowly over time, while we slowly weaken his powers throughout the rest of shadowlands
[19:51:48] mojusk: yea we'll get mount soon
[19:51:53] CDubTheRIPper: becuase im not walking that much LUL

[27:46:48] RageerPLZ: @Dcarter I beleive pet battles scale, so you could just use a bunch of level 1's who counter affinities to make it easier, atleast they scaled in BFA
[27:46:54] Thadune: @Towelliee I made a mistake... I guess it depends what rules the fight is sanctioned under. Most HWs are unlimited now.
[27:47:04] ThePawPaw: btw why we doing this again? pet battleing in SL KEKW

[27:51:59] ThePawPaw: D are you on discord or
[27:52:03] Jlohh: Do I have to do the Threads of Fate quest campaign on my alt? Or can I just spam dungeons and dont miss on anything

[27:56:07] TheRavenGrave: i recomend : One Punch Man , Castlevaina, Dragon Ball ( any), and FLCL <-- good anime
[27:56:10] Yordie_Sanders: @ThePawPaw have you uninstalled and reinstalled WA? that might clear the cache and fix it
[27:56:15] ThePawPaw: @headcase74 really but why new ones are gona too doe

[31:15:49] DangerfieldSOSA: I HATE whoever decided no mounts in the maw
[31:15:54] AthenaP47: no pathfinder achieve yet, and i think they said no rep but tied to renown
[31:16:09] NewWorldReign: Do you have the wolf mount from the Valor quest?
[31:16:30] Jessarin: @Towelliee favorite thing so far about SL? worst?
[31:16:35] Stargazer27: yeah, every covenant gave us their powers already

[31:16:50] AthenaP47: or at least make it an upgrade you can buy at the lowest tier from her
[31:16:52] Kneckt: idk if it will cause they have mounts for the maw from torghast
[31:16:59] osofuerte: chaotic riftstone
[31:17:01] osofuerte: is nice
[31:17:01] Drakenking: Youre crazy if you dont think the permanent upgrades are good for QoL stuff
[31:17:06] alex12645: it reminds me of classic
[31:17:14] Coox69: i bought the teleport thing but other than that nothing
[31:17:16] DarkWingXP: i saw peeps with mounts in the maw
[31:17:16] Drakenking: Youre gonna cut youre time in the maw in half without them and make your torghast runs significantly harder
[31:17:17] SorionTheGinger: @Towelliee most of us aren't paladin tanks so those thorgast items are useful for us
[31:17:23] Drakenking: err easier, rather
[31:17:42] Exxcar: The Maw QOL are huge....
[31:17:43] CDubTheRIPper: is there a raid on the other side of the maw?
[31:17:44] Exxcar: like
[31:17:46] Drakenking: Its all about speed in the maw I mean for that stuff, mobility in the zone and some bonuses for Torghast
[31:17:51] Exxcar: if you aren't getting them you are gimping yourself
[31:18:01] Drakenking: Torghast may be cake as a tank but I had to eat between packs on layer 3
[31:18:16] koala_mimmie: i wonder if jewelcrafting will be more profitable this expac since people will have more sockets

[31:18:49] Firedexx: do you think Threads of Fate leveling for your alt is faster then grinding back through the story?
[31:19:04] Drakenking: @Firedexx Its not just about it being faster but being able to get stuff for end game while leveling
[31:19:10] ottavianni: it's the same covenant for all ur tank's @towelliee?
[31:19:14] osofuerte: @Firedexx Depends on if you group or play solo. If you're solo it's not. If you're grouping it can be.

[31:23:50] DragonofWolves: chat is necrolord good for warlocks if your raiding, but not actually raiding like progression raiding?
[31:23:52] GCnT: @Nazarius the other is a keycult case with zelios linear 67gr switches... have not decicded on keycaps yet

[31:25:01] conv3rge_: @GCnT Oh hell yeah! Two very nice boards, I'd say the ALT is damn near the perfect keyboard 65% if it had 5 pin hotswap sockets.
[31:25:05] DragonofWolves: ok because i saw on icy veins that night fae is suggested for torghast and necrolord for raiding. but eh i'll see when i get there

[31:27:21] GCnT: @Nazarius 5 pin hotswap would have been perfect indeed, but I don't have any stability issues withe the 3 hole one, but the Kailh box switches have a bit thicker feet than other switches and it helps

[31:28:35] conv3rge_: @GCnT Oh no doubt, I just hate clipping the pins off switches, incase I ever want to solder them in later. I might just be OCD though lol. I did clip some v1 Inks, pretty much all I use in mine at this point.

[31:52:04] Knocx: im gonna play whats fun
[31:52:11] DecayedmiNt: @Daggerstry Pug scene is terrible in general in that regard. They "want" carries, and do stupid shit like not inviting good players because their precious split. There were pugs in BFA that denied Limit players because it'd ruin the split. As if said player wouldn't do 50%+ of the group damage.
[31:52:24] Kalitvenec: lenovoLURK bnqLurk
[31:53:12] Knocx: what do u think of Bear?
[31:53:13] Bayne77: i think my warrior tank is fun as shit so far

[31:53:25] jason_tacey: like holy priest, they aren't doing to well I hear but I will continue to play mine :)
[31:53:37] Abbz44: Warrior finally having an aoe taunt is pretty nice I won't lie. But it being a 4 minute cd is pretty rough
[31:53:37] DecayedmiNt: @Knocx Bear stronk. Just doesn't have good burst dmg.
[31:53:38] Kruell13: I’m a vengeance DH and I’m loving it.
[31:53:39] john_kekw: towHi_SG

[31:53:51] Kruell13: I’m at 177 ilevel...need a few more pieces
[31:54:01] Z3ROR: Just play what you like. Over time you will master the class you've chosen. Just have fun. :)

[33:02:48] SoxenJP: @ThresherXG If you don't have friends don't do it. I took threads on my druid alt and queued up for healing 50% shitfest in those LFDs
[33:03:00] jerseyfive: dungeons should be faster
[33:03:09] blazenx416: yeah i figured that hes one of the best tanks in the world
[33:03:15] KeleStraza: I think the key is having a group of people, it will be slower than normal campaign if you are not in a groun
[33:03:37] blazenx416: dks still suck
[33:03:56] Ozzwrath: Hi Lads ! How's everyone doing ?

[33:05:02] McSteaze: Which tanks do you find the most fun atm?
[33:05:15] Rhythmiix: @Towelliee Don't you need to do the campaign quest line?
[33:05:26] Rhythmiix: Or can you just skip it..
[33:05:38] junkrat_sky: KPOPselfie
[33:05:48] AnDy_the_Dj: If you complete it once on a character, you can skip it with Trades of Fate
[33:06:11] TheUnknowing: you can skip it on your alts @Rhythmiix
[33:06:15] kaihole: damn that's nice

[33:06:44] Exrny: do you just choose a covenant when you hit 60 on alts?
[33:06:47] Rhythmiix: I can't just skip to grind faster
[33:06:52] TheUnknowing: Yes, once you finish the campaign on one character it can be skipped on every other @Rhythmiix
[33:06:53] nicplaypoe: no u cant

[36:16:43] HaxzorJimDuggan: you live in CA the answer is yes LUL
[36:16:44] techfall1601: depends
[36:16:45] Carryout: Yes it does
[36:16:45] Sniper_Penguin: as long as the exterior shape does not change, you shouldnt need a permit
[36:16:47] Thunderbrew: They have to make sure it's safe.
[36:16:49] SpoofAvatar: walls yes, could be a load baring wall, need an inspector to confirm
[36:16:50] gud269: only need one usually when you are expanding on a house
[36:16:51] scenario17: if it is structure
[36:16:51] Strike1Delta6: yes it does for Structure
[36:16:52] poisonide: some places a new window requires a permit
[36:16:52] Tyrandian: It will literally depend on your state.
[36:16:53] Arocian: make sure they have bonded and insured
[36:16:53] SquirrelMaster61985: if you are adding rooms then yes. if you are just removing walls then no
[36:16:53] xXBlitz_BeatzXx: Depending on what you are turning room into
[36:16:56] Garfong: Some cities only require electric and plumbing to be permitted
[36:16:56] RageFit: in cali probably
[36:17:00] Schlong_John_Silva: not if its doesnt alter any structural components
[36:17:02] thecheesusrice: just about everything in and or around your house or property in california needs a permit, especially in riverside and san bernadino counties
[36:17:02] kashmara: Taking out walls will likely require an engineer to make sure you're not taking out load bearing
[36:17:03] lardris: pretty much everything needs a permit
[36:17:03] TazzTheGrimreapper: @Towelliee have to check the city codes
[36:17:04] shywolf: if it changes your tax assesment yes
[36:17:12] Vecter39: in california you probably will require an architect
[36:17:14] lnquizi7or: It's because the work can increase the value of the property so they have to track it in order to raise property taxes
[36:17:16] Carryout: in California you need a permit for everything. It has to be earthquake safe
[36:17:18] six_tracks: i do my own electric work because i'm confident in my abilities but i technically need permits to do major re-wiring
[36:17:21] slayermyth74: where i live, it does.. but here if you are making cosmetic changes like new flooring, etc don't need one
[36:17:25] Dularr: Rule of thumb, if you are making a perm change, it requires a permit
[36:17:27] t3hmobster: need a permit to breathe in cali lol
[36:17:30] gud269: @shywolf exactly what he said, if it changes Tax assessment
[36:17:31] Tomanak: @Towelliee I live in riverside county like you do, we removed a wall and just had to show the county that the wall wasnt load bearing for our house
[36:17:31] liquidxburn: long as its not window
[36:17:35] smithman40: depending on the state but yes and if you rent you must have owners approval
[36:17:40] TazzTheGrimreapper: in california you damn near need a permit to take a piss
[36:17:49] itsbinkgamingtv: !wa

[36:28:41] bobmcfob: Definitely not getting enough anima
[36:28:47] daddy_dolby: @Towelliee It increases based off renown. The higher the renown, the greater the world quest rewards
[36:28:48] Rage487: probably a story thing because of the whole drought they have going on and itll probably increase as time goes by
[36:28:51] Blackrose_Darkthorn: yeah but as long as you do the conductter each day you'll gett the end resultt to perm power something up
[36:28:53] bigpoppapump990: blizzard does that shit all the time..
[36:28:58] YasudoCZ: for the chance of a mount
[36:28:59] Bugszy: yer i feel every other resouurce we have farmed was quicker but anima just seems like it takes for ever
[36:29:01] pooranoia: @Incredible_Sausage lmfao
[36:29:04] Thunderbrew: We must be talking about WoW, cause complaining
[36:29:09] JbasWB: i mean u can kill it several times though?
[36:29:15] SphinxyOCE: im only doing the TP stuff
[36:29:16] YasudoCZ: almost everything about the sanctum is cosmetic
[36:29:18] JaMinky: you get grateful offerings @ towelliee
[36:29:19] SphinxyOCE: the other stuff is meh
[36:30:01] PRlCKLYPETE: gated behind the redeemed souls anyway :( stinks
[36:30:01] MethmM: what should i focus upgrading first in the covenant or doesnt it matter
[36:30:08] YasudoCZ: I sit on 3k+ anima and cant do anything with it because I dont hzave lost souls :D
[36:30:23] Caanan20: teleporters are nice to have though
[36:30:25] tingoskrat: hey towellie are you bothering doin all the world quests on your main or just the ones for your covenant?
[36:30:33] Incredible_Sausage: think Keyrian's gonna get nerfed?
[36:30:34] HunchoLeo_: you're giving me the added motivation to go finish up my WQs lol
[36:30:39] YasudoCZ: so spending 25 a day for a chance of a mount is nothing

[36:32:21] Jesserave: i got that mount last night its sick and so rare
[36:32:29] InoXen: my renown is buggd can't get to lvl 4 xD
[36:32:32] gooseboy429: ardweald is super laggy atm
[36:32:34] MethmM: if they adjust some of the numbers it can turn out better no doubt
[36:32:44] Brodih_: @bloodstrider123 which one ?
[36:32:44] Shrenko: @InoXen its not bug, its intented to not go above 3 in first week
[36:32:46] Exitarnium: InoXen 3 is how far you can get this week rooDerp

[36:33:15] InoXen: oh okey, ty ty
[36:33:19] PRlCKLYPETE: treadmills brah
[36:33:20] Contractual_: what would u like to see there?
[36:33:26] Thunderbrew: We are 5 days into the Expac. I think we can relax
[36:33:26] MexicanMisker: i feel like threads of fate is slower without a premade group
[36:33:31] TanAtlantis: are you playing all tank classes in shadowlands?
[36:33:31] purpgarma: The only current incentive is getting more renown for the conduit upgrade
[36:33:39] purpgarma: The sanctums feel so empty beyond that
[36:33:53] Rudric_Ice: anyone knows who won the FIGHT ??
[36:33:54] Secondbreakfasttt: wq are so long and rewards not satisfyng
[36:33:56] BriscoGDP: fuck that.. every WQ everyday.. ZZZZZZZZzz
[36:34:14] Dixa1: @towelliee what influenced your decision to go kyrian on the dk?
[36:34:14] JbasWB: i mean its the first week of release why yall complaining so hard LUL
[36:34:15] duhworks: @Towelliee use the traps they give 4%
[36:34:16] TexValhalla: yeah so far the only thing i would truly change in SL rn is hands down the WQ
[36:34:19] MethmM: some areas overall in shadowlands has too low of a mobs spawn rate i have noticed
[36:34:20] ShleppyGaming: Which mouse do you use? The pro or elite?
[36:34:30] tingoskrat: hey towellie are you bothering doing all the world quests or just the ones with your covenant?
[36:35:09] Secondbreakfasttt: callings!
[36:35:16] YasudoCZ: I guess I just dont care that there is no player power tied to the sanctum. cosmetic rewards are fine and it doesnt require people to farm WQ for hours, better to do no WQ than do something so boring for hours just to fill a bar imo
[36:35:26] MethmM: its 1 calling a day right?
[36:35:31] Contractual_: great, the game is more casual friendly - hardcore players can focus on alts :)
[36:35:38] telgarh: i opened a ticket 3 days ago and still no answer omg
[36:35:40] TonnyGamerLive: being able to play alts it's more enjoyable than having to do 2000 wq everyday
[36:35:44] tingoskrat: gotcha, what about the maw dailys in the maw? :/
[36:35:52] Winkz: being forced to clear the board of WQ's in legion and BFA was the worst shit...ill take this any day
[36:35:53] Contractual_: yeah if u had to do 2000 world quests then u couldnt do alts
[36:35:54] spookaninja_21: Been sick with the flu the past few days (flu not rona) so thank you for this amazing marathon so I alway have something to watch while I’m awake
[36:36:16] Rudric_Ice: I am stuck in queue for about 2 hours can't even play the game NotLikeThis
[36:36:17] AzizianQ: its huge but is it good?
[36:36:19] Brodih_: did you spend gold on gearing your monk also ? @Towelliee
[36:36:21] ForTheSchmitt: Brag!!!
[36:36:22] ole_veteran_grit: why do I keep sharting myself
[36:36:29] dinomiyte: stephen A said he is afraid that tyson is literally gonna kill roy lmao
[36:36:31] SpoonManes: TOO MUCH FIBER
[36:36:36] MethmM: it seems like they're giving more "time" to level up alts since there isn't so much progression to be made at max lvl
