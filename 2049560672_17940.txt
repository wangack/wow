[5:03:46] Fossabot: Evaluating your channel, it looks like your recent viewership has been fluctuating significantly, and we are looking for consistency rather than occasional spikes in viewership. You should aim to consistently average at least 75 viewers per stream, not including any viewership from hosts, raids, front page, or embeds.

[6:29:41] ZhaTheStreamer: 17, 32, 48
[6:29:54] Fuzzybeard90: half of the stuff with classic is being attached to your armor tho. so it matters that you look the way you do
[6:30:31] Tenriism: I just don't like looking like a melted box of crayons.
[6:30:37] Fuzzybeard90: like you can see someone and know exactly what they got and what they did to get it. Armor and progression means far more in classic
[6:30:51] trekkin: I mean look @Renfuryy FFS. in Classic he'd be level 18
[6:30:52] settau: yeah i get that
[6:30:58] settau: @Fuzzybeard90
[6:31:15] squishalan: you still have to farm the gear

[6:43:54] o_squared: damn ok I'm excited for classic to get there
[6:43:59] Zolshy89: the only problem with mop was that alot of classes could do everything
[6:44:07] Zolshy89: so it replaced the utility of other classes
[6:44:09] Fuzzybeard90: classes were insanely fun
[6:44:26] ricky_lake: MoP was a straight up pander to China and now look at them

[6:45:53] DesiHeat: slowapeJam
[6:45:55] ZhaTheStreamer: WoD had nothing to do, basically all there was was raiding
[6:46:09] ricky_lake: Bobby was like sorry westerners, it's all about China now
[6:46:10] Fuzzybeard90: exactly. But people realized how good MoP was
[6:46:14] cosmin284: slowapeJam
