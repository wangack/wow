[4:48:17] Ralffeh: u gotta win 3 vs higher rated teams
[4:48:23] loukatmie: The average mmr was 990. and youre 1100 cr. so 3 Wins 3 losses = 0 cr
[4:48:24] HayeDel: did you lose hard the last lobby?
[4:48:29] SSD511_: Blizzard was trying to fix mmr but actually they broke it
[4:48:32] HayeDel: they do snowball lobbies
[4:48:33] TY_Dunston: Even if you get O your MMr goes up
[4:48:54] loukatmie: you just need to keep playing
[4:48:54] ask_peter: @daydream13 wrong.. even in this game there was one with 3 wins who got rating.
[4:49:00] memostar: yep 1000-1600 is probably how it feels silver-gold rating in mobas :D
[4:49:03] TY_Dunston: Your CR didn‚Äôt go up. But MMR did. I think they said that‚Äôs how it goes.
[4:49:03] DiabetoMan22: I love for Swiftly!!!!
[4:49:06] Ralffeh: your mmr probaly went up a bit from that game
[4:49:28] twiztedjay9000: his mmr was 990
[4:49:33] babusch09: LOL
[4:49:35] HayeDel: yeah so in your next game if you win 3 rounds you probably gain rating
[4:49:38] xxwheybolicxx92: lol dman
[4:49:41] battletanker: DELETION INBOUND!!!
[4:49:43] SilkeySmooth: 3 wins is no rating for me and matches usually got 3/3
[4:49:44] BaldGruff: you wouldnt
[4:49:46] EliBourne: why would mmr go up if you lose
[4:49:50] benmfs: lmao
