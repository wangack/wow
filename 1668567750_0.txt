[1:27:31] UnicornzGamingg: after level 10 the lvl3 difficulty is ez
[1:27:33] Darksaiyan: T3 with the extra quests AND modifiers are probably the best to level, now that the xp and money you get from T3+ increased in the last patch

[1:51:28] dafuqpod: does this game have a lot of content? or is it like cod zombies where u can just play for survival and rounds?
[1:51:28] Chucka29: yeah love this part
[1:51:32] asaltyfilipinoulrick: shroud carrying
[1:51:44] blacckmore: @jh3tski also feels like gear is way more significant when you make the jump into difficulty 3-4-5
[1:51:47] DKGaming88: i have played over 100 hours and i have never seen it when it gets to extraction personally.
[1:51:49] Redfuryin: i had a 3 stack of llvl 7s and 8s in a lvl 4 run and they instantly died in the first fight and left lol people are so lost in this game lol
[1:52:09] asaltyfilipinoulrick: @dafuqpod it's a left4dead game with modefier missions
[1:52:17] xhairbait: has he not seen the linus tech tips fps rendering and input video with you shroudy?
[1:52:17] asaltyfilipinoulrick: shroud carrying
[1:52:22] buck_maul: @DKGaming88 yeah any horde area wont have them, like this type of extract or room holds for elevators
[1:52:27] ClarkUK: @dafuqpod Has 13 missions currently, a lot of it is replayability honestly
[1:52:32] tweakhawaii: @asaltyfilipinoulrick okininam
[1:52:33] tocitkatempr: 😌🪅🪅🪅🪅
[1:52:43] StalkmaN: Don't know why but gunplay doesn't feel satisfying at all, psyker looks more fun
[1:52:55] dafuqpod: @dafuqpod clearing missions is challenging or ?
[1:53:00] Gunman_90: wardGG wardGG
[1:53:02] Jh3tski: Hows the character distinction in this? Heard its flater compared to v2 until you get higher in lvl
[1:53:04] tocitkatempr: PunchTrees HungryPaimon HungryPaimon HungryPaimon
[1:53:05] joga_de_teemo: This mode reminds of the good ol L4D
[1:53:07] CrazedHumanoid: I had a nergle boss in that extract run it was nuts
[1:53:27] DKGaming88: @StalkmaN Really? I find Psyker a bit slow..
[1:53:27] Redfuryin: @StalkmaN then youre not using the right gun lol there is some really satisfying guns in this
[1:53:27] Rocket_J: HeyGuys
[1:53:29] jucytor: game has no content
[1:53:29] ClarkUK: @dafuqpod Yes, certainly on the higher two difficulties. Can be at the lower diffs too if you aren't familiar with the genre
[1:53:35] mctagger35: lvl 11 your unlock the loot box vender
[1:53:36] asaltyfilipinoulrick: @dafuqpod tf you pinging yourself LUL oh btw shroud is carrying
[1:53:50] dafuqpod: @dafuqpod i see thank you
[1:53:56] popsnopp: shroud still playing on easy, am i dreaming?
[1:53:59] pepega_overlord: @dafuqpod yeah the skill ceiling for this is very high, since the game is a successor to another one very polished game (vermintide 2)
[1:54:02] dafuqpod: @asaltyfilipinoulrick idk bruh i am quoting the other guy
[1:54:05] dankmemes4u: its -6 where i live
[1:54:08] xbushdid711: xbushdid711 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 54 months! 
[1:54:17] asaltyfilipinoulrick: @jucytor some people might argue but it's a good game
[1:54:18] sultanofswatt: What difficulty is this?
[1:54:24] yes_fn: !mouse
[1:54:24] StreamElements: He's using the Logitech G303 Shroud Edition Wireless- With a Logitech G840 XL Gaming Mousepad shroud Edition - His mouse and mousepad are back in stock! Get it while you still can!
[1:54:34] Yxothil: No
[1:54:35] Cado_: @sultanofswatt It's mission to mission.  Depends on what they choose.
[1:54:38] Kaelsen: scrapping weapons give a portion of the credits back
[1:54:41] jucytor: @asaltyfilipinoulrick it is good, i liked the 6 hours ive played, but there s legit nothing to do after
[1:54:52] tocitkatempr: love
[1:54:56] magisterbii: Mans has got 28k lol
[1:55:10] blacckmore: Zealot with a dagger bleed build is Kreygasm

[1:55:35] vanity_kafshaz: is this like Vermintide where you have to raise your power level to get better items to spawn in the shop?
[1:55:35] Bleedorang3: For the Horde!
[1:55:35] Cado_: Power sword is WICKED
[1:55:40] CrazedHumanoid: dagger actually has good horde clear
[1:55:42] Chucka29: does shroud had a big lad character?
[1:55:45] kufangar: dagger is crit end game single target. go for aoe cleave at this point
[1:55:49] Kaelsen: I honestly think the power sword is amazing
[1:55:52] buck_maul: @Danielmoore84 gear is lvl locked
[1:55:57] NeverteI: Bolter got nerf, not really worth using
[1:55:57] Redfuryin: i started seeing the bolter in the teens
[1:56:04] ClarkUK: @asaltyfilipinoulrick Yeah, it's kinda like this after a while. They will likely do content drops eventually like in VT2 but the endgame really is just replaying the same missions if you like the content
[1:56:11] CrazedHumanoid: power sword is crazy ATM
[1:56:15] DKGaming88: @Chucka29 Think he just has Pyker and Sharpshooter atm
[1:56:18] asaltyfilipinoulrick: normies using meta power sword while I'm here enjoying my dagger
[1:56:22] roryx13: does this game autosave?
[1:56:25] DeerPlayer: so bad smooth
[1:56:27] Wiztango: the MK 1 and 4 swords have different movesets fyi
[1:56:28] Davimotion96: Power sword is the most broken thing in the game,I love it
[1:56:45] asaltyfilipinoulrick: @clarkuk I agree.
[1:56:52] Unbiddenarachnid: Veteran has the best melee weapon the power sword
[1:57:03] Chucka29: @dkgaming88 cheers.
[1:57:05] Roargy: roargyWave
[1:57:13] tocitkatempr: cheaters
[1:57:17] neuroni84: mk1 sword just has 2 horizontal sweeps for heavy attacks, simple ez horde clear beginner weapon.
[1:57:26] Aurarus: Surge staff is bugged atm, you can indefinitely spam it if you sprint forward out of the charge and cast insta-damage
[1:57:34] Aurarus: beyond 100% peril
[1:57:43] asaltyfilipinoulrick: that veteran jacket is my kinda style damn
[1:57:52] Chucka29: the machine gun on ogrym is so fucking fun
[1:58:06] Roargy: Woah. This game looks so good.

[2:01:38] wethetv: It's better to just rush if you want to level quick
[2:01:48] PsY_CrO: @Yoojul I have 3 lvl 30's, my vet is currently 15 KEKW
[2:01:51] Ureka82: Scriptures isn’t usually as efficient as rushing for leveling
[2:01:51] Yoojul: ah it dont reset . got it
[2:02:00] asaltyfilipinoulrick: @psy_cro no lifer LUL
[2:02:05] simplySouron: @Yoojul lvl30 is like 25+- games... 2-3 days of playtime

[2:03:16] mother_of_animals: @birdmanbozo mechanically hella fun. not the most content, but it'll get more over time. it's not too expensive either
[2:03:17] starcommando3: bro stop giving me duelling sword for the dailies fatshark
[2:03:19] tocitkatempr: 🫦💨🐶
[2:03:20] fatherhudson: what's the reason to bind dodge and crouch to the same button?
[2:03:35] pepega_overlord: @Dies_Often covers arent tall enough in this game, so crouch ends up being very situational tbh
[2:03:37] ciandio: @PsY_CrO how can we level up faster? i am bored at level 24 as vet.
[2:03:42] tocitkatempr: se
[2:03:45] EinsteinT9X: watching to decide if i want to buy this game or not lol
[2:03:49] rimlocks: shroudDab
[2:03:50] tocitkatempr: sez
[2:03:54] Insilgo: A lot of Vermintide players bind dodge to shift as you can't dodge forward but you can still sprint forward
[2:03:55] eno_rl: Game good?
[2:04:00] Dies_Often: @pepega_overlord ive cleared enough heresy levels to know you need to be able to crouch unless youre an ogryn
[2:04:01] tocitkatempr: sez u shroudDab

[2:04:34] Kaelsen: Crouch becomes significantly important at higher tiers. Where the gunners melt you since they can aim

[2:10:33] X3N0VERZE: this game has memory leakage, did you restart the game within those 4hours?
[2:10:42] Nepph7: hi shroud
[2:10:43] imqaush: hi
[2:10:48] QuirkyFresh_: suck my nuts
[2:10:51] subtoxiic: clocking down ram has to be done in Bios?
[2:10:59] starcommando3: its not the psyker its a coincidence
[2:11:02] Yxothil: But shroud crashed with psyker too before changing staff
[2:11:06] QuirkyFresh_: i apologize
[2:11:08] VRockk: just a random crash
[2:11:18] tocitkatempr: @quirkyfresh_ shroudDab
[2:11:29] Yxothil: I noticed that too with my memory
[2:11:31] confileus: catJam
[2:11:36] Preyoshi: is this the same universe as Warhammer total war series?

[2:11:56] KillroySanchez: @Preyoshi officially no, but same chaos gods pretty much
[2:12:02] tamakko: Yea I have to restart after few games play as pysker as well
[2:12:05] mariocorn: justrun ISLC program.
[2:12:06] Blueberrypiie: @Matter_v2 some of it ppl still crash
[2:12:11] vendrickee: @Preyoshi apart of 40k Total war is different
[2:12:13] kufangar: new game , released before it was "ready" , ofcourse there is memory leaks. were all 40$ beta testers 😄
[2:12:21] alientech51: @ceed_911_ I had same problem,just need to clean ram memory with alcohol yellow parts

[2:13:28] corkies2: @Preyoshi think of total war as fantasy and long ago, 40k is future and much more mechanical with some science fantasy
[2:13:42] ceed_911_: @ceed_911_ Yeah. Downclocking helps as well. Sometimes the stated clocks chosen with ram performance profiles can be unstable.
[2:13:49] starcommando3: dont pick up the deamon guy
[2:13:57] portalica: anyone else getting LFD2 vibes
[2:14:00] Matter_v2: @Blueberrypiie think they make another fix soon?
[2:14:18] KillroySanchez: @portalica it's super similar, vermintide 2 gave me the same vibes also
[2:14:20] Blueberrypiie: @Matter_v2 probably they are doing small updays daily
[2:14:24] double_g29thd03: its like cod zombie

[2:14:41] blastboys123: Its like l4d with rpg elements
[2:14:42] anvil_stone: yeah running into a daemon in public lobbies can be rough because some people accidently run into them. Best thing I found is find a pillar/cover and just keep using dodge around it while your teammates kill it.
[2:14:55] blastboys123: @mrminkle  :)
[2:15:17] ValdorUOOG: I have been using the Zealot with the Thunderhammer. Very satisfying feeling when you charge it up and crush in someone's head.

[2:15:56] Jewforce1: @filipasian_ they have 1 grimoire
[2:16:03] blastboys123: because grimiores have a minimum corrptuio thing
[2:16:05] ClamWaffles: @filipasian_  because of the grimior

[2:23:18] Blueberrypiie: @Cado_ if you die with the grim is lost sois better for ogryns

[5:02:29] cheeseburgxx: i think its a big turn off for players of new games to get told too much information instead of letting them ask as it comes
[5:02:49] Kujo_XX: What's up with the dynamic buttons at the bottom?
[5:02:52] pantry_: @shroud your target of target frame is in your target frame FYI
[5:02:56] Protomateria: @cheeseburgxx exactly, really easy to overwhelm new players with too much info

[5:07:52] monsieurnoodls: is Q & R just modifier macros?
[5:07:53] deucezmongooses: looks like his
[5:08:03] keeehlan: can someone tell WoW veteran whether or not DF is actually better than the last 2 xpacs? I'm really torn on whether or not to try it
[5:08:24] dudeman42022: what level is shroud and bnans?
[5:08:26] deucezmongooses: @keeehlan its fun so far. if you arent strapped for cash its worth the money
[5:08:30] petrosgambit: @dudeman42022 69
[5:08:40] sne3zyylive: !hidechat
[5:08:40] wowVAIN: @keeehlan too early to tell. season 1 hasn't even started but so far the questing and overall experience feels way more high quality than the beginning of shadowlands and BfA
[5:08:44] le_61_: @keeehlan the flying around is absurdly fun
[5:08:45] vashaun: @keeehlan its a lot of fun so far. dragon flying is amazing
[5:08:49] Protomateria: @keeehlan it seems a lot better so far. no mandatory shit content like islands or warfronts or torghast, you can just play however you want
[5:08:49] dudeman42022: Pog
[5:08:50] yungturbo__: @keeehlan but why not just simply try it instead of stressing about it lol
[5:08:54] kumoii_: @keeehlan Currently, it's better than the last two. Professions actually matter, multiple different build paths, Dragonriding is insanely fun etc
[5:08:54] madula: professions give a lot XP too
[5:08:57] insaniity: first time crafting items gives a bunch of xp, like 2 whole levels @shroud
[5:09:04] john_0134: did you guys skip a bunch of side quests or something?
[5:09:05] kumoii_: @keeehlan Dungeons are fun, there's only 1 that I dislike
[5:09:11] john_0134: im 70 and in the azure area still
[5:09:14] nemzky: I hit 70 in the third zone how are you not max from the story quests
[5:09:22] wowVAIN: @kumoii_ the one with the waves or the one with dragonriding?
[5:09:22] kumoii_: @jschlim You did TOOOO many side quests KEKW
[5:09:32] john_0134: lool im just ocmpleteing everything atm
[5:09:33] StreamElements: Check out Mike's Instagram account - http://www.instagram.com/shroud :D
[5:09:44] kumoii_: @wowVAIN The one with the dragonriding. Because I have to constantly hit Stealth to get off my dragon KEKW
[5:09:48] keeehlan: what are the chances that DF inflates itself to even remotely resemble the progression nightmare that was SL?
[5:09:52] rxyzyxr91: don't go alchemy, its broken atm
[5:09:53] kumoii_: @jschlim Do that AFTER you finish the main story LUL
[5:09:55] pantry_: 100k worth of mats
[5:10:01] john_0134: lol im out here grindin
[5:10:08] wowVAIN: @kumoii_ why not just use the same keybind you use for mounting?
[5:10:08] Triligi: all of your first craft items give mad exp thats all you ahve to do buy all the materials to make everything once
[5:10:14] pantry_: not hard but it would be 100k each
[5:10:16] voidzyxd: spam dungeon levelin prof takes longer if you dont kno what youre doing
[5:10:19] FelAfflicted: think it's like 6 minutes for 2 lvls or something
[5:10:19] kumoii_: @keeehlan So far.. It looks like it's not gonna come close to SL's progression system & that's good
[5:10:25] thieu_c: u only get exp on first craft so u have to craft alot of difrent things
[5:10:31] itschad: definitely not 100k of mats
[5:10:32] pantry_: stocks are down
[5:10:37] kumoii_: @wowVAIN Cause the keybind I use, is just manually clicking. I don't have a multi-button mouse
[5:10:42] kaylathepear90: lol
[5:10:46] Marragar: wait. are you canadian?
[5:10:56] yungturbo__: Aware
[5:10:56] kaylathepear90: RPP @shroud
[5:10:56] Elceecruz04: thats a whole level of lazy LUL
[5:11:06] monsieurnoodls: most leveling guides have a quick and ez shopping list
[5:11:12] monsieurnoodls: just by X amount of Y
[5:11:13] pantry_: depends on the crafting you want to do
[5:11:16] thenewguy176: @Elceecruz04 that's valuing your time sir
[5:11:29] ace4607: true
[5:11:39] mrgamer0909: @kaylathepear90 tfueHEY tfueHEY tfueHEY tfueHEY
[5:11:43] frozencoldxd: ALT 6 KEKW
[5:11:44] Protomateria: @thenewguy176 i wish i could "value my time" by getting my viewers to do shit for me :)
[5:11:45] wowVAIN: @kumoii_ i barely use my mouse keys either. are you using your keyboard to its full extend by having each key bound with also each modifier (shift, ctrl, alt)?
[5:11:50] theitzcope: how you make it look so easy to move and attack lol
[5:11:51] jalle90: @shroud you only do like taloring/leatherworking/blacksmitting
[5:11:54] illusion_killz: iitsgo1Hulk iitsgo1Hulk
[5:11:55] its_hekks: @shroud yea because the only way to do it is doing new recipes one by one cant repeat same ones
[5:12:02] monsieurnoodls: Is that ability thing at the bottom just a priority WeakAura?
[5:12:09] dudeman42022: @shroud have you tried the new class yet?
[5:12:16] wowVAIN: @cope0fmercy it is easy. you have to bind A and D to strafe instead of turn and then control camera by pressing Right click basically permanently
[5:12:25] senTose7: !who
[5:12:25] Fossabot: @senTose7, He's playing with its_WiKeD with anythiNG and Buhhbye in vc - https://multi.raredrop.co/tshroud/tits_WiKeD
[5:12:28] jalle90: @shroud click the filter and first craft bonus and have materials
[5:12:33] kumoii_: @wowVAIN Nooope, I have small technical hands LUL So my fingers aren't long enough to reach Alt as well as press 1-6 at least Lol
[5:12:37] KingDramox: Which UI addon is that chat?
[5:12:39] kumoii_: @wowVAIN I'm 100% a clicker
[5:12:43] Nihrz: @dudeman42022 thats his first char hes 367 on it
[5:12:45] DrippinSoul: looks like you need a prot warrior
[5:12:57] Krahnicz: God this expansion looks like shit
[5:12:59] Protomateria: @KingDramox elvUI
[5:13:00] dudeman42022: @Nihrz ahh sweet ty
[5:13:02] kumoii_: But I've done it so long, that I'm able to pay attention to say dungeon/raid mechanics while still pressing the correct buttons Lol @wowVAIN
[5:13:07] monsieurnoodls: Anyone in chat know if that rotation at the bottom is just a WA; even shoes keybind
[5:13:09] Triligi: get some people to carrry you through a specefic que fo ruby pools and its done in like 7 minutes and get a level per about 15 min
[5:13:13] KingDramox: TY
[5:13:17] Protomateria: @Krahnicz ok classic andy
[5:13:20] theitzcope: @wowvain oh shit never thought of that thank you!
[5:13:21] madula: the UI profile is purely for raiding, can't see levels or elite icons
[5:13:21] dabbingmoose: @Krahnicz damn sounds like you havent played it then, everyone likes it
[5:13:21] wowVAIN: @kumoii_ but you are not limited to number keys. some of the best keys ever for small hands are Q E X C V R F G B
[5:13:38] thenewguy176: i like loot
[5:13:39] wowVAIN: @cope0fmercy no worries! getting the hang of the movement in MMOs is the first big step into becoming a way better player
[5:13:42] jraggun: Is this the gw2 UI?
[5:13:51] DrippinSoul: @krahnicz gods not listening
[5:14:03] wowVAIN: @jraggun i don't really see how it resembles GW2. it is just ElvUI
[5:14:14] forexpatty: Why does UI look so different from yesterday?
[5:14:15] kumoii_: @wowVAIN So since I'm a clicker player, I don't use Left + Right click to move my character. So using essentially the letters in replacement for numbers, I can't do
[5:14:16] GunnerSaurus24: click the summon dragon dude button
[5:14:27] theitzcope: @wowvain I'm addicted to the game rn lol. but need new ways and I ain't got the time to read everything lol

[5:14:50] thenewguy176: bnans is funny
[5:14:58] SanMuki: UI for ANTZ ?
[5:15:01] norsel0rd: I love the new class really good step up from shadowlands
[5:15:12] Protomateria: @kumoii_ you click your abilities to use them? i didnt think players like you still exist in 2022 lol
[5:15:32] wowVAIN: @kumoii_ I use WASD for movement and right click for camera control. i dont use left+right to move forward because its very limiting and it forces you to be dependant of the way you look permanently. it might be tough to get used to it but it would greatly improve the quality of life if you manage to get rid of clicking spells and using more keys
[5:15:36] fadeskii: fadeskii subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 17 months! 17mo pog, hope you have a nice night :)
[5:15:47] kumoii_: @Protomateria Yeee KEKW But like I've said, I'm able to do so while still paying attention to core mechanics Lol It's honestly a surprise tbh
[5:16:14] poupsoopTV: this UI addon is kinda ass :/
[5:16:22] Protomateria: @kumoii_ yeah that sounds pretty rough. honestly just handicapping yourself lol
[5:16:25] DrippinSoul: top raid dps is beast master hunter frost DK Affliction Warlock Arcane mage and Boomkin
[5:16:26] kumoii_: @wowVAIN I might give it a shot, but it's rough for me to try new things usually. Especially when it boils down to keybinds Lol
[5:16:34] GillisX: how can you pay attention when you have to look at your abilities and click them xD?
[5:16:39] BoogeyManSC2: @kumoii_ I click for buffs bc I'm too lazy to keybind them lmao
[5:16:46] wowVAIN: @1ktopshotta every class has at least a DPS spec, most have two and some even have 3. a spec is a subclass of a class.  It is hard to define a "best" class because the content is very varried (raiding, dungeons, pvp). I would recommend going for something very easy at first like a Demon Hunter
[5:16:50] kumoii_: @Protomateria Ohh I know, that's partially why I don't play WoW at a serious level. Because I know I'd just be a burden in most cases Lol
[5:16:59] kumoii_: @BoogeyManSC2 That's essentially me LOL
[5:17:10] Protomateria: @kumoii_ well at least youre self-aware lol
[5:17:24] monsieurnoodls: @shroud Is the big rotation icon a WeakAura?
[5:17:44] kumoii_: @Protomateria Yeee so I just try to do my best in terms of paying attention LUL I'll scuff up my rotation even just to make sure I can dodge something or whatever Lol
[5:17:47] voidzyxd: mike has no faith
[5:17:49] keeehlan: which classes got the biggest update this xpac?
[5:17:52] voidzyxd: she is a GAMER
[5:17:58] frozencoldxd: wow is a lot of muscle memory
[5:18:07] DrippinSoul: @keeehlan warriors got alot of love
[5:18:08] Rxqulol: @monsieurnoodls p sure its weakauras from atrocity's ui
[5:18:12] Arvakr: what add on do you use for your frames?
[5:18:13] kumoii_: @keeehlan Rogue's are pretty fat right now imo. But I'm kind of biased. Warriors got a lot of love too
[5:18:27] Protomateria: @kumoii_ well it sounds like youre making it work so more power to you SeemsGood
[5:18:29] wowVAIN: @keeehlan all classes got changed because of the talent tree revamps. some play pretty much the same while eithers just have a slightly different flair to them. none got fundamentally changed as far as I recall
[5:18:31] Vuxxxz: @wowVAIN well i plan on getting to end game so would that still be a good pick
[5:18:34] DrippinSoul: Outlaw rogue is so fun right no
[5:18:39] monsieurnoodls: ty!
[5:18:45] kumoii_: Yeah so far so good @Protomateria KEKW
[5:18:48] Gypsie270: What was it called?
[5:18:51] flashnickgg: RainbowPls
[5:18:54] Jelly32: hey chat does anyone know a guide for lvl a new character?
[5:18:54] kumoii_: I'm enjoying Assassination Rogue atm
[5:18:59] kaylathepear90: i love this one
[5:19:04] Arvakr: @Jelly32 check wowhead :)
[5:19:09] GillisX: how is fire mage in dragonflight as of now?
[5:19:12] MrChaCho: best questline in the game
[5:19:12] minkyawthu: !armory
[5:19:13] StreamElements: @minkyawthu, here's a link to his WoW Classic armory: http://bit.ly/TBCArmory
[5:19:17] wowVAIN: @1ktopshotta again, end game is defined by PvP, Mythic+ Dungeons and Raiding. 3 very different types of competitive content. Demon Hunters do pretty well in all of them and are very easy to pick up having the simplest rotation out of any class
[5:19:18] kumoii_: I tried out Dragon Tempered for ST, then swapped to Kingsbane. There's only like a 250k damage diff between Dragontempered
[5:19:20] DrippinSoul: assassin tis bottom of the barrel for raid dps
[5:19:23] Protomateria: @GillisX pretty bad i think unfortunately
[5:19:39] Gypsie270: @shroud whats was the addon called again please?
[5:19:48] kumoii_: @DrippinSoul Luckily I'm a Dungeon player, not so much a raider Lol
[5:19:50] JovanniOfRivia: @Gypsie270 hekili
[5:19:59] Gypsie270: Aww thank you
[5:20:05] GillisX: as a mage main that hurts me to the core
[5:20:07] minkyawthu: What is your main shroud?
[5:20:16] DrippinSoul: @kumoii_ yeah same actually why i went port war for M+ tanking
[5:20:19] Gypsie270: thanks man!
[5:20:25] seathOG: Nice UI Mike!
[5:20:26] DrippinSoul: prot*
[5:20:29] Protomateria: hey kaylee
[5:20:57] Protomateria: @asthelegendgoes no, its his gf and shes never played wow before lol
[5:20:58] uwugrim: is this in dragonblight northrend?
[5:21:09] DrippinSoul: i enjoy the speedruns of M+ and they affixes
[5:21:27] JovanniOfRivia: @Protomateria well, she's kind of paying, but not with money Kappa
[5:21:28] keeehlan: is M+ actually out already?
[5:21:32] minkyawthu: I need to know shroud mian in Dragonflight
[5:21:36] Protomateria: @Protomateria yeah shes brand new to the game lol
[5:21:40] DrippinSoul: next tuesday M+
[5:21:51] kumoii_: @DrippinSoul Yeah I'm primarily a M+ player. So runnin' Assa for high burst windows or for execute, I'm perfectly fine with it
[5:22:00] DrippinSoul: can do M 0s spam tho now
[5:22:01] kumoii_: @DrippinSoul Plus, I was forced into playing Outlaw during BfA
[5:22:17] dextasy_: smh
[5:22:19] DrippinSoul: @kumoii_ ah dang yeah being forced can ruin a spec
[5:22:22] Diinklebeeerg: does that neck upgrade for everyone?
[5:22:25] keeehlan: did I just see a Heart of Azeroth wtf
[5:22:32] MrChaCho: yea
[5:22:34] Protomateria: yep once a week
[5:22:39] kornutzzzz: never played wow before. looks wild.
[5:22:41] Sweatyj123: can only loot mythic0s once per week
[5:22:43] DrippinSoul: you can't spam heroics
[5:22:45] insaniity: m+ is gonna be lit :]
[5:22:47] pantry_: yes the neck does upgrade for everyone
[5:22:50] DrippinSoul: m0s you can spam
[5:22:53] kumoii_: @DrippinSoul Like I loved Outlaw, cause massive AoE cleave & honestly solid ST. But for me when I play Assa, I primarily aim to be a ST DPSer
[5:23:02] dbgzx: only once a week
[5:23:05] seink1: you can spam hero for 569 items
[5:23:09] minkyawthu: can i know shroud main in DF? NotLikeThis
[5:23:11] wowVAIN: @keeehlan https://www.wowhead.com/item=195210/heart-of-azmerloth#comments
[5:23:15] MrTrebs: m0 is 1 dungeon each time per day
[5:23:18] dbgzx: heroics is once a day
[5:23:18] seathOG: what addons are you using?
[5:23:27] keeehlan: @keeehlan lmao oh
[5:23:37] insaniity: nah it wasn't a heart of azeroth, it's a joke it looks it
[5:23:46] insaniity: the devs wanted to meme about it :P
[5:24:02] bigyordan: It's 3 days into summer and all i feel is pain
[5:24:03] DrippinSoul: @kumoii_ yeah whatever is the most fun is definitely worth playing over "meta" and tuning is always happening so i dig it
[5:24:06] DeerPlayer: back the plunder !
[5:24:22] LonnGevity: chat...do you move by clicking in this game?

[5:24:50] DrippinSoul: lol loved this quest
[5:25:00] LonnGevity: @mcnasty304 thank you
[5:25:01] kumoii_: @DrippinSoul Yeah like I followed the meta somewhat for tanking last expan. When Demon Hunter was REALLY good for Dungeons. But that's as close as I went to following a meta
[5:25:24] PapaShidders: @shroud how are you liking DF so far?

[6:07:01] AnxiousKitty: Kappa

[6:12:32] MickyFresc: @jonyward you mean like under his resource bar thing that fills up? weakauras
[6:12:35] crankyhashbrown: Where is shrouds lvl on screen?
[6:12:58] 0xygenhomie: hes like 65 ish

[6:13:20] crankyhashbrown: Gotcha was curious if he had it on screen or not
[6:13:52] 0xygenhomie: 364 gang sup EZ
[6:13:53] seink1: you can spam hero get 569 crafting mats and then do rares for best gear
[6:14:06] iiTzTini: can talent it to knock up
[6:14:11] Liquid2120: talent to knock up
[6:14:15] Dherjee: @shroud talent in the bottom middle of the class tree
[6:14:16] rxyzyxr91: yes theres a talent that knock them up instead of away
[6:14:53] KeepEyesOpen: PepeLaug
[6:14:59] KeepEyesOpen: PepeLaugh
[6:15:05] BornAGosu: !valorantsettings
[6:15:05] StreamElements: @sitaroou, here's a link to his Valorant settings: prosettings.net/valorant/shroud-valorant-settings/ | ADS: Hold | 400 DPI - Sens: 0.87/ scoped 1 | !crosshair for his code and info
[6:15:12] rxyzyxr91: it knocks up in place
[6:15:15] nock7urn4l: up isnt back
[6:15:21] seabiskit: up not back
[6:15:21] Sweatyj123: yes, talent makes it knock UP instead of BACK
[6:15:22] nock7urn4l: they will be in the same place so you can have others hit them
[6:15:24] Dherjee: knockup is just a soft stun
[6:15:26] iiTzTini: right it shoots the min the air
[6:15:30] Liquid2120: it goes up in air not away from you
[6:15:50] osoi____: is shroud being cute today?
[6:15:51] dogpoo420: random dung que is taking forever which is weird is it bugged
[6:15:52] 0xygenhomie: thats really cool, they dont take away the cc just modify it
[6:15:58] Jumper3917: is he playing vulpera shaman or am I blind?
[6:16:26] 1h30n3: did u import this profile or did u make it?
[6:16:45] nock7urn4l: what level does DH start at now?
[6:17:00] 666infess: !sensfornite
[6:17:02] mcj2k: ssmoke
[6:17:14] Jumper3917: Nice, I have one of my own just for how cool the totems are
[6:17:18] SpicyFeta: encha shammy feels good?
[6:17:56] bambitay22: shroudYEP
[6:18:09] wowVAIN: @spicyfeta enh shammy always feels good
[6:18:10] 666infess: !sens
[6:18:10] StreamElements: @nefalemmm, Looking for his sensitivity for a specific game? Type the game name and sens - like !valorantsens or !apexsens
[6:18:24] kreeperjoe: yo shrouyd plays WoW???
[6:18:33] Ez_Fn_Pz: @kreeperjoe nah
[6:18:36] 666infess: !fornitesens
[6:18:38] Windelius: what ilvl are u
[6:18:42] kreeperjoe: @kreeperjoe my mistake
[6:19:22] 0xygenhomie: toxic Kappa
[6:19:34] 0xygenhomie: he was looking at her dmg wasnt he Kappa
[6:19:35] thenewguy176: are dungeons usually this easy?  Tank never dips below 95%
[6:19:48] Danny_Neptune: healing is the hardest roll in the game, tanking is residentsleeper and dps is autopilot
[6:19:49] thruxo: what ui is he using?
[6:19:51] TrickModeX: Healing has a floor but honestly i think dmg and tanking have a higher ceiling. As long as people are alive, youre a good healer
[6:19:52] kreeperjoe: @thenewguy176 in normals as healer, i do more dps than heal
[6:20:07] 0xygenhomie: nah dps is hardest
[6:20:18] nock7urn4l: just look at overhealing and theres your answer
[6:20:28] franq246: U are correct
[6:20:28] cheeseburgxx: overhealing/dispells/damage taken
[6:20:30] nock7urn4l: a good healer not only keeps everyone up but also doesnt overheal, and anticipates
[6:20:31] Jumper3917: this expansion is amazing, were it not for all the bugs, glitches and constant disconnects...
[6:20:31] BagamaTwitchTV: you also can do damage as a healer BTW
[6:20:33] StripSniper: tanking is the easiest
[6:20:34] sweetkazen: LMAO its not KEKW
[6:20:38] venbor: melee dps is rough :D
[6:20:49] trizket: dps is the hardest
[6:20:50] sweetkazen: Mythic+ tanking is very demanding
[6:20:51] BagamaTwitchTV: Evoker is like a 60% of a pure DPS damage
[6:20:51] reduct_ion: people just cant mentally handle tanking
[6:20:52] kreeperjoe: @BagamaTwitchTV yeah, dont just stand there
[6:20:53] Elceecruz04: healing by far is the hardest job in WoW
[6:20:54] Exlin_TV: tanking is the easiest but most stressful
[6:20:55] j0rdanx387: just tell a tank they're important and its all good
[6:20:55] Koffiekoekje: It's kinda your job to be aware of everything as tank
[6:20:56] petrosgambit: healing is harder lol
[6:20:58] chinesedave: yes it is, tanking by far the easiest, then ranged dps, melee and healer
[6:20:58] Dherjee: @shroud tanking is easiest unless you're doing world first mythic raiding, cause then you dont get loot 4Head
[6:21:01] Koffiekoekje: Healing is staring at healthbars LUL
[6:21:02] trizket: LUL
[6:21:04] petrosgambit: healing also deal dmg wtf are you talking about chat
[6:21:10] OlShyrion: tanks in M+ is harder they are responable for the route and stuff
[6:21:12] petrosgambit: dps only dps, healers do everything
[6:21:12] 0xygenhomie: healing isnt about healing, its about doing damage
[6:21:14] reduct_ion: the one time i type in chat i get 4 ads
[6:21:14] nickthesizz: tanking and healing hardest, gotta know debuffs and mechanics
[6:21:16] SnipezZ: tanking is definitely the easiest
[6:21:17] kodark: tank must choose facing direction
[6:21:17] Meta_Nova: Healing is hardest by far. Its the most dynamic role. DPS fuck up differently. Tanks fuck up differently. The difference happens every fight. And you have to be aware of mechanics while also taking care of people FAILING mechanics
[6:21:30] chinesedave: @Meta_Nova this
[6:21:34] LegendJRG: tanks just need to be aware mechanics wise its easiest but kinda necessary for keeping track of everything
[6:21:34] kreeperjoe: @Meta_Nova yes
[6:21:37] 0xygenhomie: the biggest misconception is that healers have to heal, what you really need to do is damage
[6:21:38] trench_toaster: in high end m+, tanking has a lot of responsibility (pulling based on party CDs, routes, etc)
[6:21:39] LegendJRG: healing is hardest always has been
[6:21:46] thenewguy176: RIP Woolie :(
[6:21:48] StripSniper: not in dungeons
[6:22:02] XarchX101: !ui
[6:22:02] StreamElements: @XarchX101, he's using Lorti UI: http://bit.ly/LortiUI and Dominos: http://bit.ly/WoWDominos with Prototype Font: http://bit.ly/PrototypeC
[6:22:06] Rantallin: @oxygenhomie thats a thing ive liked about mythic+ stuff, i think more people have learned this
[6:22:11] thenewguy176: um
[6:22:11] legendaryfarter: can u put an exp bar for us :D
[6:22:17] Meta_Nova: And GOOD healers are harder to come by. Because if a healer is good at reading their group and knowing whats about to go wrong. THey can adjust and still throw in some DPS. Or they can only react and do no DPS>
[6:22:28] kreeperjoe: @Meta_Nova PREACH
[6:22:28] 0xygenhomie: if a dps fks up, they dont parse, esp melee. hardest role to play
[6:22:54] TinyNinjasGG: How is new expansion?
[6:22:57] OJ_oreo: usually when nothing else to hit
[6:22:58] trizket: tank damage lmaooo
[6:23:05] pisswizzard: Well then you just lava lash to spread
[6:23:20] Syon_: @oxygenhomie LUL
[6:23:23] reduct_ion: melee dps is much more involved and i think is harder then ranged dps for sure
[6:23:24] GoldieLoxGG: what class is he playing
[6:23:25] StreamElements: @GoldieLoxGG, Mike plays the Evoker class, the new expansion class and race for dragonflight.
[6:23:27] elscena: what add on is this and does it work for every class?
[6:23:32] petrosgambit: @oxygenhomie 🤡
[6:23:34] Meta_Nova: If a DPS fucks up and doesnt parse its because they're bad. A good healer parses based on if their dps did a good job. Stand in fire DPS make it to where healers cant live up to their full potential
[6:23:46] 0xygenhomie: bunch of non parsers in chat lol
[6:23:51] CBTrooper: THIS MYTHIC?
[6:23:56] kreeperjoe: @Meta_Nova exactly
[6:24:01] thenewguy176: all this gold but you can't pick it up
[6:24:21] Oniji: how do you unlock heroics? i have the ilvl for it
[6:24:22] santygg242: l
[6:24:23] Meta_Nova: @kreeperjoe The fact that youve understood what I've said means you understand the healer plight. You're a real healer. Respect.
[6:24:29] thenewguy176: this is what the inside of the federal reserve looks like btw
[6:24:43] kreeperjoe: @Meta_Nova haha, healing people while they stand in bad. RESPECT
[6:24:45] trizket: im an orange parse thank u very much  FeelsDankMan
[6:24:49] neildeg: what do you main, @shroud
[6:25:00] Meta_Nova: Honestly. Over time I just let them die so I can parse @kreeperjoe
[6:25:15] Nanoleets: buy 3060TI now or wait for 4060? (apparently releasing in june)
[6:25:16] kreeperjoe: @Meta_Nova XD

[6:25:47] Itsameaspagaro: how is the xpac
[6:25:52] TRCK5TR: @Nanoleets Do you need a card now or in June?
[6:26:02] Meta_Nova: Playing OW as a support will quickly teach you about how groups that don't take unnecessary damage do better. Because their healer can live up to their full potential
[6:26:20] reduct_ion: @Meta_Nova this!!1
[6:26:24] tehworks: xpac fun
[6:26:27] bambitay22: it was evoker but im thinking he enjoys shaman more
[6:26:33] kreeperjoe: @Meta_Nova hard to keep everyone up when they disregard what they are doing
[6:26:44] kreeperjoe: were not gods lol
[6:26:57] bewlah: is this classic or regular wow
[6:26:59] Zorphon: LUL
[6:27:00] 0xygenhomie: no one dies if youre evoker or druid lol
[6:27:04] Nanoleets: @TR1CK573R_ ye i know thats part of the problem, kinda need it before june with a couple of new games coming out before that. but then again i dont wanna miss out on the potential extra bit of performance in the new gen
[6:27:07] kumoii_: Retail @bewlah
[6:27:09] trizket: BOOBA
[6:27:11] Meta_Nova: @kreeperjoe Why no heal when I stood in a blatant mechanic im supposed to avoid!!!!

[6:27:15] XarchX101: what is your ui setup?
[6:27:17] vzci: ppL TeaTime
[6:27:22] kreeperjoe: and even when shit hits the fan, despite it being DPS fault, i still take it personally like as if i failed and didnt do a good job as healer
[6:27:28] kreeperjoe: @Meta_Nova lol
[6:27:36] 03Tavares: hello @shroud
[6:27:58] Meta_Nova: @kreeperjoe Thats another thing about healers. If the group wipes your first thought is "Did I fail?" vs everyone else going "Who failed?"
[6:28:05] jmu_duke: @shroud Battlebit has a open beta tommorow
[6:28:14] Rudric_Ice: Mr sniper buy some bigger bags
[6:28:17] kreeperjoe: @Meta_Nova im trash and everything is my fault

[6:28:37] DrGreen__TV: GO ELE
[6:28:41] kreeperjoe: and telling chat what to do
[6:28:49] Tisel: There are so many addons that will practically play the game for you these days that standing in stuff really shouldn't be a thing anymore.
[6:28:58] ArtTuroK: is just cosmetic?
[6:29:00] kreeperjoe: @Tisel so true, yet it prevails
[6:29:01] amoghabaj: Valo when brother?
[6:29:10] kreeperjoe: some people just auto pilot
[6:29:18] Meta_Nova: @kreeperjoe Theres a reason tanks/dps are usually shotcallers vs DPS
[6:29:32] Meta_Nova: @kreeperjoe Vs healers**

[6:29:34] Tisel: I mean there are even addons that will calculate your optimal rotation in real time. With questionable results, sure, but still mostly adequate.
[6:29:40] Jumper3917: mag'har orc at that
[6:29:43] theguardlover: f

[6:30:03] StreamElements: Check out Mike's Instagram account - http://www.instagram.com/shroud :D
[6:30:14] petrosgambit: best role for raidleading is caster dps
[6:30:17] Meta_Nova: Granted my whole argument falls apart when i admit to being a non-healbot healer.
[6:30:23] Meta_Nova: Masochist
[6:30:28] kreeperjoe: HAHAHAAA
[6:30:41] kreeperjoe: ../bow
[6:30:46] kreeperjoe: not worthy
[6:30:51] deekseverywhere: my guardian druid only gets int weapons/healing trinkes for some reason from world quests
[6:30:52] Meta_Nova: It just makes it too easy IMO
[6:30:52] finstas: wait, why is the healer doing the most dmg?
[6:31:08] itsquetzy: bro downloaded max's full addon folder
[6:31:30] kreeperjoe: @Meta_Nova i like the cut of your jib Meta
[6:31:35] Rudric_Ice: how do u even play this game with all these visual clutter
[6:31:41] greylovesmatchalatte: @finstas i think bnans is the healer

[6:32:35] 0xygenhomie: @Rudric_Ice not really clutter, its all information he wants to see
[6:32:37] Meta_Nova: @kreeperjoe Look,  I play games simply for the challenge. If I make the game a point and click adventure I should just play a point and click adventure, not to dog healbot users. I would probably be better with it. But theres no healbot in FFXIV.
[6:32:38] e_z_chee_z: what class

[6:33:27] e_z_chee_z: I'm playing WW monk for the first time as a noob and trying to find someone to watch.
[6:33:32] 0xygenhomie: evoker is cracked, im loving it
[6:33:37] Rantallin: @Meta_Nova ive always assumed the time it'd take you to react to an addon is already time lost vs if you were good enough to not need it. but I've never used it so maybe im just dumb

[6:33:50] kreeperjoe: @Meta_Nova it takes away the aspect of being a healer, sure it makes you "better" but i commend the fact that you DONT use it. that just proves how on top of it you arte. thats a flex for SURE. jelly on taht toast
[6:33:54] e_z_chee_z: it's fucking impossible to find good videos for noobs. they all just expect you to be a seasoned vet

[7:46:56] DubWub281: if you've never played WoW is it even worth trying to play?
[7:46:57] KokongWei: Are you using the default UI?
[7:47:04] Emma96Fenrir: hey shroud hope all is well and hey chat hope everyone having a awesome day
[7:47:17] PpOyster: @shroud the jagged ice trinket is poopoo
[7:47:18] jamesmcnasty: is that addon telling you what to press
[7:47:27] MadZmaru: Hi Shroud just a quick question, did you abandoned Valorant already?
[7:47:28] femboykiss: adjacentpixels, It doesn't matter which char they level up first, but i honestly dont know what the question is FeelsDankMan
[7:47:33] trelala: @dubwub281 of course
[7:47:34] Koffiekoekje: @DubWub281 is any game if you've never played it?
[7:47:42] Finaljustice13: anyone know does he use a add-on to see the floating damage numbers I don't have that for my characters
[7:47:53] CocidiousMcBeth: @DubWub281 if you like the journey and just enjoy getting there, or like clappin fools in pvp then wow is def worth starting :)
[7:47:56] HaadKhor: @femboykiss thanks
[7:48:23] Koffiekoekje: @Finaljustice13 I vaguely remember seeing something about it bein bugged / turned off, might be a command that turns it on
[7:48:27] femboykiss: DubWub281, You can try free until level 20 see if it's something for you before you buy it ratirlFlower
[7:48:38] regste: i dont see much difference in heroics and mythics tbh
[7:48:53] femboykiss: Finaljustice13, Check your settings it should be somwhere there
[7:49:00] kovi_lol: Adge
[7:49:20] HaadKhor: once i hit level 20 my adventure will be on pause until i sub
[7:49:23] flamenowayout: !classicaddons
[7:49:24] StreamElements: @flamenowayout, shroud uses SexyMap, Atlas, Bagnon, Details! Damage Meter, Dominos, LortiUI, Weak Auras, and TSM (TradeskillMaster). Font used: Prototype. Full list here: https://clips.twitch.tv/AuspiciousHedonisticBaconCharlieBitMe-lo617BXkDq7AIQCD - Updated 6/9/21
[7:49:33] StreamElements: Check out Mike's Instagram account - http://www.instagram.com/shroud :D
[7:49:34] pppjze: !server
[7:49:36] Fjalin: Is this atrocity UI?
[7:50:06] femboykiss: regste, There's a few little differences in the spells enemies use, Currently there are only Mythic Level 0 released, In 2 weeks or so they release the higher tiers, Where you get keys to go higher levels which buff enemies and debuff your team
[7:50:43] regste: i think its mainly due to people knowing what theyre doing in mythics
[7:50:49] AlienFlames: better gaming chair
[7:51:22] femboykiss: Yeah that too, Most of the high-level players that run Mythic Dungeons have done them on Beta to prepare for it, So they already know everything the bosses and enemies doo
[7:51:37] CocidiousMcBeth: @regste that helps a lot. if your healer or your the tank you notice the diff quite a bit, if your dps and the tank and heals do their job then you wont notice the changes much
[7:51:44] PpOyster: @femboykiss not always, we don't all get beta :(
[7:51:45] yifors: yes, there is something like that still, some weird interactions with warlocks gates for example
[7:51:51] HalfTrack_: tauren hit box to my knowledge is not a thing anymore
[7:52:11] AspireAmity: I didn’t know anything about the mechanics of mythics and just steamrolled them with pugs. Healing is just strong I guess
[7:52:17] femboykiss: PpOyster, true pspSadge I personally prefer to learn it on live, but that's just me
[7:52:23] jietoh007: where was the time i liked enhance shammy
[7:52:28] PeanutButtaSpoon: watched your stream for all of 30 seconds and im redownloading WOW after 2 years off
[7:52:39] regste: i found normal the hardest lol
[7:52:51] regste: i guess puging is a little different
[7:52:54] PeanutButtaSpoon: so thank you and curse you
[7:52:57] goldiesoulo: orc shaman ftw
[7:52:58] AspireAmity: Open world is hardest content IMO
[7:53:06] PpOyster: @femboykiss ye I usually wing all my first runs. Have tank that knows routes tho xD
[7:53:24] Finaljustice13: @femboykiss ya it's on in settings this hasn't worked for 2 expansions
[7:53:31] borkibass: Elemental or enhancement shaman?
[7:53:38] AlienFlames: is this like genesis from new world?
[7:53:44] AlienFlames: quick and dirty
[7:53:56] PpOyster: @shroud ele sham goes crazy
[7:54:00] regste: are you maining enhanced shroud
[7:54:01] crunkbub: spec into primordial wave that shit slams
[7:54:18] femboykiss: Finaljustice13, Weird, have you tried reinstalling? Otherwise i can recommend Mik's Scrolling Battle Text as addon, but it's not above the enemies it's on the sides of your character so might not be what you're looking for
[7:54:35] Yanchini: have you ever considered playing Guild wars 2
[7:54:55] goldiesoulo: whats your main ?
[7:54:59] hexedlotus: enh sham for life
[7:55:02] cheiodjarda: hey, can some1 tell me whats the combat scrolling text addon?
[7:55:03] jietoh007: i like the story telling in gw 2 more
[7:55:07] hexedlotus: @shroud any tips for WOTLK enhance sham?
