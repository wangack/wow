[0:16:16] Tyrou: Wow look at that! Hunters mark isn't useless now!
[0:19:35] soshiecho: @tyrou still only a 1% dps buff throughout a fight at best it’s something, but won’t get hunter a mandatory spot for the buff
[0:19:41] wEiRdO_dUdE: Demon bikes!
[0:21:57] Tyrou: @soshiecho i mean true, but still not a useless button anymore for 20% of a boss's health lmao

[0:31:39] cabalish: towHAMUP  good morning everybody  zekeBLANK
[0:33:31] jmalmin: Hunter mark raid cooldown... but it only works for 100% down to 80% on the boss/mobs...  it lets us do 5% more dmg. What a strange raid cooldown.
[0:35:33] robert_332: hii all
[0:35:34] Tyrou: @jmalmin 5% more damage for 20% of the fight... meaning 1% damage increase for the fight
[0:36:24] jmalmin: I guess its better then nothing.
[0:37:55] Tyrou: @jmalmin biggest issue is monk and DH basically do the same thing for the full fight so hunter still useless

[1:47:48] Thoreya: @manmower yes

[1:48:07] Sicknessqt: `Fair but disappointing
[1:48:15] Klarynse: I am just thinking future with Metzen coming back in. no way he is involved with the "now"
[1:48:27] Thoreya: so classic + is gonna be a thing
[1:48:36] Thoreya: were gonna have 3 big versions of the game LUL

[1:49:38] mavericks312: @ogdemonix why would they change there art style it’s aged beautifully
[1:49:39] valianya: Not locking down the story but the style of design.
[1:50:12] Dark_Kornax: I agree, just stating why i think so many people like classic
[1:50:12] manmower: plus for people under 40, Classic is technically new content
[1:50:17] Thoreya: i just dont have the patience to play classic, i need more uptempo stuff. combat, etc
[1:50:20] Dark_Kornax: I think having both is the best of both worlds
[1:50:25] Dark_Kornax: they are different games
[1:50:25] Yagr6: i think the story has gotten a little to idk the word too big too dramatic
[1:50:31] Dark_Kornax: and serve different purposes
[1:50:45] NickLeonhearth: @manmower under 30, lets not get crazy here
[1:50:52] Aro725: I love classic. I started in legion and always felt like i  missed out. And no i get to replay all the old expansions like i always wanted to. its perfect imo
[1:51:09] Yagr6: i thought arthas was perfect
[1:51:14] mavericks312: Give me titans,old gods, cosmic beings all day
[1:51:59] Furinax: shadowlands story tho kekW
[1:52:03] Molvonos: I know a lot of people think that Storytelling for WoW Peaked at Arthas, for some reason.
[1:52:06] herzlustafir: 4
[1:52:10] Klarynse: dang so its not my fault i dont understand wtf is going on?
[1:52:16] Thoreya: would be a good idea to have a quick recap tho for people that havent logged in in like 3+ years

[1:52:50] Klarynse: 15 year player and still unsure lmao
[1:52:50] dracullus: DF is fresh start, it doesn't have to recap 9 expansions
[1:53:09] xziyn: Having the main story locked behind renown was such a dumb idea. It's terrible for new players
[1:53:23] dracullus: you take whines of classic andies too seriously
[1:53:28] Thoreya: ^ but if peoples last rememberance is like anduin and slyvanas, its gonna be confusing to know what happened after
[1:53:35] DunzoCD: @Molvonos those have to be nostalgia based opinions, since we saw the story of arthas culminate that started through WC3. the story telling has only gone up imo

[1:56:24] manmower: is it really hardcore if you're doing it in easy classic content?
[1:56:24] pigzip: @towelliee you are missing your weapon buffs
[1:56:27] robert_332: is this an orc shammy or kultirian?
[1:56:40] dracullus: hardcore retail is possible, but it would have to be special mode with harder world and calculated XP (so you can't just farm easier zones), a lot more work than classic era
[1:57:34] cptrogers123: I hated wow hardcore in the beginning, but it pains me to say that im fucking hooked on it now @Towelliee
[1:58:06] Yagr6: he said the thing
[1:59:06] 91Niki: Good morning Towelliee and chat towHi
[1:59:12] raldrik: yeah if everything scales to you is there any danger
[1:59:36] notdustinx: Shaman deserves tank spec
[1:59:47] YSGMarquise: I have fun with retail how it is
[2:00:04] robert_332: orc shammy
[2:00:12] bypized: Retail needs Torghast
[2:00:15] kevdeckie: you can do your own hardcore...you die you delete.  Easy
[2:00:21] Yagr6: hardcore works in classic bc the game is about the leveling process... retail is about endgame and leveling sucks generally speaking
[2:00:26] raldrik: I think the only hard core that could be a thing is an optional affix on M+ so you cannot res but you get some cosmetics
[2:00:34] dracullus: it sucks DF doesn't have challenge stuff yet
[2:01:10] dracullus: *solo challenge
[2:01:13] TheGiant99: DF just has zero reason to log on every day like say legion was
[2:01:15] kevdeckie: too much stuff can one shot you in retail.  forget doing raid hardcore.  too many mechanics
[2:01:30] abracka_: the hardest part about HC classic 1-60 is not getting bored/sleepy and misjudging a pull
[2:01:39] Boats_NW: complacency
[2:01:45] Thoreya: hardcore is a better viewing experience than it is playing it for me imo
[2:01:49] Stixxerz: i died yesterday 18 mage cuz i stepped forward on cast and then ended up dead
[2:02:04] valianya: Retail is not designed to be deadly enough during leveling to be Hard Core.  And endgame content in Retail is either deadly solo or easily soloable

[2:09:38] WickedNastyGaming: Vanilla for sure wasn't made for casuals, it was made for the grinders
[2:09:56] mavericks312: Ppl gotta let go of that vanilla nostalgia an look at it clearly
[2:10:03] TweektheProphet: i didn't raid until BC and even then barely
[2:10:03] Yagr6: to me casual is 2k m+ rating but realistically its prob alot lower than that
[2:10:16] Brodih_: most people did not even make it to 60 back in 2004-2005
[2:10:33] WickedNastyGaming: 40 man raids were awesome once you had a good regular group. the farming for resistance gear etc / attunements was a lot fun to actually do. and is what made WoW - WoW
[2:10:35] neftario105: @Towelliee you read the WoW Blizzard Leak?
[2:10:36] brazkat: wow is super casual, im an above avg casual and i got 6 toons at 445 most with all 20s now
[2:10:55] cynical_effect12: Its easy to forget what older WoW feels like because it isnt in your face anymore. The game has become the most casual friendly its ever been. getting to max level in a few days, LFR, and what not
[2:11:04] raldrik: I think there are just more people who think they are elite and act like it.
[2:11:15] cynical_effect12: No atunements
[2:11:16] johniiv: People are dumb. They want Classic mechanic (NONE) with retail easy access. And then they will say, oh why am I bored. I have no challenge
[2:11:19] DunzoCD: people are quick to forget attunements

[2:13:44] Nokterian: And clearly shows what Raider.io does with break the meta
[2:14:12] Zettabyte: Meta should launch a service called Meta Gaming Kappa
[2:14:33] timbo_slice: true lol
[2:14:44] TheGiant99: Why can't people just play to have fun isn't that what games are for
[2:14:57] toocheap2rhyme: its his show
[2:14:58] theDirtyon3: @TheGiant99 being meta is fun though
[2:15:31] Gingerprimer: Also the fact is playing a meta spec is way more fun in a season since you will spend less time in ques or waiting for ppl to join your key
[2:15:38] theDirtyon3: ^
[2:15:47] theDirtyon3: this alot of this
[2:16:04] theDirtyon3: more time actually playing=more fun
[2:16:05] Tyrou: @Gingerprimer ^^ facts
[2:16:07] theDirtyon3: simple math

[2:19:02] RocketMan23: well people are idiots
[2:19:04] kalamari__: I am an outlier. I like to watch longer videos^^
[2:19:11] theDirtyon3: adhd is a motherfucker KEKW
[2:19:15] Yagr6: which is very stupid to do that
[2:19:16] UncleDece: We ain't got time for a 30 minute video
[2:19:18] Tyrou: most of the time i just jump to whatever class i'm looking for the info on and then stop watching after that lol
[2:19:18] Nealanny: I always watcing 20 min videos towKek
[2:19:33] Gingerprimer: So does not really matter if Max does/does not make a tier list since demand is there
[2:19:36] Dinomight3: reputation
[2:19:39] dracullus: they want info about bis spec, they are idiots because they don't want to waste their time?
[2:19:49] Haotududis: I do like how he gets big people that play the spec/guide writers to chime in on their spec though so it's not fully just his perspective
[2:19:58] theDirtyon3: i dont see him at that at all tbh
[2:20:22] jmo99_: People just gotta remember to take what these top 1% players say about a class or spec with a grain of salt
[2:20:23] Rabbi19: Man I must be part of the other percent that listens to it all. Granted I listen while working so it fill gaps.
[2:20:23] WickedNastyGaming: but wouldn't that be what his content would be? since he is a world first raid team leader?
[2:20:26] Tyrou: Yeah he is supplying the tier lists for the people who are pushing to "need" the tier list to know what's meta so they know what they need ot play to have fun
[2:20:38] Keyastaron_: i would try to be in a CE guild but i work 6 days a week and im first shift if i was like 2nd shift maybe

[2:22:28] R2RHIN0: This is so true, I always go to Max for new patch tier info. But I enjoy watching his videos in full
[2:22:40] Yagr6: o7 ele
[2:22:42] dracullus: pretty obvious people who watch guides want to play strongest specs, I don't care and I don't watch guides
[2:22:42] Gingerprimer: @manmower yeah meta gaming is way more fun because of this fact
[2:22:57] theDirtyon3: He tries to seperate his takes for the 1% and the casuals.. He says that
[2:22:58] HaloS23: But let’s be clear! People find the powerful fun!
[2:23:15] ElmSpace: people have fun with busted
[2:23:34] Keyastaron_: people would want thats more meta
[2:23:34] notdustinx: Twitch Andy’s that think they can play like Liquid is the problem
[2:24:00] Tyrou: people like seeing big numbers, if your class gets nerfed and you don't have big numbers anymore but other class does people migrate
[2:24:02] theDirtyon3: Max knows his viewerbase is mostly high end players and he caters to them. Not his fault if casuals think they are 1% KEKW
[2:24:06] dracullus: especially when leveling is fast, gearing is fast and only system are talents which you can just copy in 10 seconds
[2:24:14] johniiv: Even without a Tier List. You can see M+ being affected after a MDI. People invite the Guardian druid and think, haha easy key boys. and wonder why they wipe
[2:24:21] mavericks312: The problem is twitch viewers think if they play a top tier class there gonna play like echo or liquid
[2:24:29] theDirtyon3: KEKW
[2:24:35] Brodih_: LUL
[2:24:40] toocheap2rhyme: some neckbeard shit

[2:24:56] jmalmin: I am not high end. I watch him either way :) Max is a nice guy and i prefer watching nice streamers.
[2:24:57] Brodih_: then.. ''MOM WHERES THE MEATLOAF''
[2:24:59] phocho: lmao that was awesome
[2:25:04] Nerendis: People who say shit like that can't even interrupt in a +10
[2:25:24] Gingerprimer: Yes but the odds of playing a surv hunyer and getting invited into a +20 is way lower than if you are playing a meta class. And ppl do not like having to spend their free time waiting in ques
[2:25:45] notdustinx: Yo that nickname is kinda dope tho

[2:27:23] theDirtyon3: I watch streams for the personality. I watch RWF for the memes fuck whoever gets first KEKW
[2:27:23] HaxzorJimDuggan: in classic vanilla guilds would bring like 10 warriors and it was dumb as fuck to me
[2:27:33] noosphear: I mean, sites advertise tier lists for Baldur's Gate 3.  Its what drives interaction.
[2:27:33] Gingerprimer: Just look on youtrube how many meta tier lists there are for Classic Leveling
[2:27:34] DallTV_: hehe
[2:27:55] dracullus: want to play what you like, just find 4 solid people to run dungeons with
[2:27:56] Zettabyte: Exit light *da-da* Enter night Kappa
[2:27:56] mavericks312: Hell vanilla raids were meta as fuck too
[2:28:05] Yagr6: i got some copium ele about to get that raid buff
[2:28:16] notdustinx: Echo is gonna go to sleep having nightmares of The Boogeyman Max
[2:28:27] Nerendis: Vanilla was the most un meta shit every rofl
[2:28:29] HaxzorJimDuggan: in true vanilla you just wanted 40 people
[2:28:45] Brodih_: nah no meta in vanilla, you could find any class with any spec in most raids
[2:28:45] Moobot:  Towelliee.com has all of your Towelliee news WoW UI addon information, and merchandise collection. Check it out!
[2:28:47] noosphear: And Vanilla avoided a lot of that because you needed 40 people.
[2:29:22] Brodih_: only Rag was hard because of the fire resist gear
[2:29:35] johniiv: Meta is in everygame now. It's the perfect content for content creators AND it's the perfect content for the casuals player that can't spend more time in the game. It's a vicious circle
[2:29:52] Keyastaron_: @Towelliee  ive seen the cata dungeon mounts drop alot recently
[2:29:58] cptrogers123: I hated wow hardcore in the beginning, but it pains me to say that im fucking hooked on it now @Towelliee  󠀀
[2:30:15] dracullus: only way to stop people picking meta in pugs is some horrible grind which cause you to play only your main, of course more alt friendly game is, more meta it become - again in pugs
[2:30:25] cptrogers123: I love hardcore, because you can do what you enjoy and not care about meta
[2:30:42] Gingerprimer: Yes but Classic tier lists are super popular
[2:30:43] PotbellyGoat: everyone was a teenager or in their 20s back then. Life was amazing
[2:31:00] Keyastaron_: i think we need pre ion devs
[2:31:01] manmower: that's just the way it is, things will never be the same
[2:31:09] TioMeko: Its only gotten to that point because of addons though no?
[2:31:12] warrenny: 3
[2:31:14] HaxzorJimDuggan: its the same number as the bosses
[2:31:14] Korupcija_: every modern mmo will have so many mechanics
[2:31:18] UncleDece: Didn't have the add-on in vanilla though
[2:31:29] a_wesker1: pres 111111 as rotation KEKW
[2:31:37] Yagr6: boomers vs zoomers
[2:31:38] PigPenLen: @Gingerprimer because everyone likes to hear whats good and follow like sheep lol
[2:31:42] siickz0hniin3: I think the AQ raids is when they started getting more mechanical
[2:32:07] UncleDece: And classic wow you already know the strats to kill the raid bosses
[2:32:15] Keyastaron_: i wanan see how much gold i get from questing from 80 from all the quests in WoW classic
[2:32:19] dracullus: not simplier time cause it was challenging for 2005 people, game was just very slow and alt unfriendly, which forced you to pick what you have available for raids

[2:49:06] Molvonos: Lilith was, but someone asked if you could transfer to a Fresh Start server
[2:49:07] Boats_NW: no its regular
[2:49:11] Ezcotli: Everything hardcore
[2:49:15] valianya: Transfer to Fresh Start defeats the purpose
[2:49:16] Boats_NW: only fresh start left is lilith on east
[2:50:01] UncleDece: I can't remember what server my legacy toon is on.
[2:50:02] DunzoCD: its a new xpac, its basically fresh start since you have to level everything
[2:50:08] Sollice: Yes its going to be packed
[2:50:10] BTiZZY_: i just wish they’d add some cooler wep types to the game
[2:50:26] PigPenLen: companys name is THS @Sollice
[2:50:37] PigPenLen: ?
[2:50:37] Sollice: No its Tha Hammer Squad
[2:50:44] Sollice: Add Sollise as a friend and I will invite you
[2:50:47] wEiRdO_dUdE: It's going to be easy,we just farming gear drops
[2:50:50] PigPenLen: ok
[2:50:54] UncleDece: Did they get rid of expertise yet or is that with expansion?
[2:51:14] Sollice: New World Company name Tha Hammer Squad Maramma
[2:51:15] manmower: do you think Lions have a chance tonight?

[2:53:02] Boats_NW: the battle pass had like tokens that would increase weap xp for certain amount of time
[2:53:09] wEiRdO_dUdE: Some of the New World peeps are saying just do the main quest in the new zone, you get a flail and you'll level it while you go
[2:53:22] 91Niki: Also I assume you gotta pay for the expansion ?

[2:53:47] UncleDece: Get my PLD class
[2:54:01] wEiRdO_dUdE: $29.99 is a good deal, there is no monthly sub in New World
[2:54:02] raldrik: feel like they are missing the mark on this. If their draw to a MMO expansion is mount races it feels like it maybe a bit light on content.
[2:54:12] BTiZZY_: i guess i didn’t see him doing those exploits lol
[2:54:29] UncleDece: Kind of wish they tossed a deal for expansion and new season
[2:54:31] DunzoCD: @DunzoCD huh? im talkin about bagginstv
[2:54:56] theDirtyon3: KEKW
[2:55:14] theDirtyon3: why would you even do that in a streamer comp. what a sleeze.
[2:55:32] Jomuse92: Exploiting is like cheating on a test or on your significant other
[2:55:53] Skars111: when does mythic raid testing start?
[2:55:59] wEiRdO_dUdE: Yeah some of those people will do anything they can to get an edge
[2:56:13] DunzoCD: he left the recent one because he didnt want to do the competition stuff he just wanted to level fast run dungeons
[2:56:14] theDirtyon3: nah that aint sweaty. Thats just no morals lol
[2:56:30] Jomuse92: ^
[2:56:45] UncleDece: Make it happen Bezos
[2:58:10] wEiRdO_dUdE: Yeah it was quite a few people who couldn't handle the big grinds
[2:58:27] Sollice: "Cosmic Cocksuckers"
[2:58:36] DadLearnsASkill: I have a wife and kids but also want to try wow for first time, is it a case of either or
[2:58:53] DunzoCD: yep, the city ownership got real
[2:58:58] Sollice: @Towelliee Just a filter
[2:58:59] Boats_NW: you gotta be pvp flagged
[2:59:06] Sollice: You have it turned off
[2:59:07] UncleDece: Yeah I think that's an option to turn it off an on o
[2:59:08] BTiZZY_: ya cuz the game was built to be a pvp game
[2:59:11] jkitchin75: @DadLearnsASkill no
[2:59:16] Sollice: No thats not a pvp flag
[2:59:16] wEiRdO_dUdE: You have to enable the map to show who owns territories if you're not flagged
[2:59:21] TheGiant99: You can turn the colors on and off I think
[2:59:26] valianya: PvP focused mmos don't pull in the numbers
[2:59:26] Sollice: Its a filter you just need to turn on to see who owns what areas
[2:59:29] CordovaGC: That's a filter towelliee
[2:59:45] wEiRdO_dUdE: That Lord of the Rings one could be good
[2:59:46] PigPenLen: yeah its a filter in the map to show colors
[2:59:52] Mehike06: I got pvp flagged at the great lift and died b/c of it
[3:00:05] DunzoCD: purple and green
[3:00:26] CordovaGC: Purple an green
[3:00:28] DunzoCD: purple owns all the real cities though
[3:01:43] Polarisss_: What's the add on that reads the quests?

[3:04:14] DunzoCD: they changed the way you push influence though, theres some influence race event that happens
[3:04:25] Molvonos: I like how First Light just got nuked off the map in prep for the expansion

[4:15:09] ArcaneMaki: Sega cancelled Hyena this morning as well

[4:15:43] TheGiant99: So glad I've been at my job 35 years and number 10 on senority list
[4:15:54] Nokterian: SEGA shutdown a bunch of projects and fired a lot of people at Creative Assembly the makers of Total War series
[4:16:00] Sollice: For the amount they are spending on development games should cost way more. Like stop making 250 million dollar games then

[4:19:35] kokochris: @Sollice as someone who has been in the industry for 20 years.. honestly AI isn't going to "code" your next awesome software out of the box.  It will assist in certain ways, but it will always need developers.  However, the team sizes will shrink.
[4:19:50] maklayy: ai wont replace programmers lol
[4:20:08] Sollice: @kokochris Yeah of course. I just mean like you said that the human needs will go down so that is going to afffect staffing
[4:20:33] dracullus: CDPR too like 10% I think
[4:20:51] kokochris: @Sollice yup agree. it will assist, team sizes shrink, developers will focus on more important aspects of the use case
