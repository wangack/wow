[1:39:37] KaisenSiru: But also remember, how well does he know Arcane to play the challenge?
[1:39:45] DrakhanGaming: Acti blizzard law suit settled for only 18 million, that’s nothing lmao
[1:39:50] DuploThief: @Towelliee look up arcane mage mage tower world record 36 secs and he killed it
[1:39:51] warrenny: Rets my main spec 300 attempts to complete
[1:39:52] Atolanos: @chizu_gaming Book lore is kind of not cannon in game so unless they explain it in game I doubt itll happen to andy
[1:39:55] The_Metal_Man: Damn I didn't realize the mage tower was still around. Thought it went away at 9.2 launch
[1:40:00] Sielu11628: @ghoulthugwow There are over 100 "leaks" on MMO-C at this point. It's not even worth mentioning anymore
[1:40:16] t0csik: Skyline just killed the jailer .. they are #3rd :)
[1:40:18] ghoulthugwow: @ghoulthugwow i see
[1:40:19] mrpresbaby: Skyline World 3rd Jailer
[1:40:20] pavepawns: its all about a certain setup

[1:42:06] Thoreya: i think players are gonna leave liquid for other guilds
[1:42:15] The_Metal_Man: They have the Ricky Bobby mentality
[1:42:24] azzurrin: If you ain't first you're last basically
[1:42:25] The_Metal_Man: If you aint first yer Last
[1:42:34] SpoonManes: liquid was going hard but unfortunately this raid just went harder for RWF
[1:42:38] DrakhanGaming: Crazy how a sexual harassment lawsuit settles for only 18 million dollars, that’s not even a fraction of how much activision blizzard makes in a quarter
[1:42:42] jayfstop: for Prot Pally what spells our the damage mitigations ?
[1:42:57] CritcobainTV: RIP liquid
[1:42:57] abracka_: Different lawsuit from the main one drak

[1:43:15] pavepawns: wouldnt look good
[1:43:17] Zeke_nl: kind of a let down, liquid had this big announcement switching from limit to liquid and getting sponsored and now they are just like chillin since they didnt get first. all other guilds are going hard still
[1:43:22] pronkk_: @zer0c00ol sheild of righteous, ardent defender, guardian of ancient kings

[1:43:59] Torturedangel: who got 2nd?
[1:44:03] SpoonManes: hindsight 20/20
[1:44:05] warrenny: Macro the hex too
[1:44:07] Darthyrevan: What liquid stuff?
[1:44:13] The_Metal_Man: Being liquid probably guaranteed a higher raider stipulation tho,
[1:44:17] Thoreya: @Torturedangel method
[1:44:40] Atolanos: @Thoreya Well kind of...the fight didnt work as intended so they are hesitant to call it
[1:44:50] Creative_Pigeon: doesn't even have windfury weapon or fire weapon KEKW
[1:44:53] Thoreya: lol they still killed it
[1:44:58] Thoreya: doesnt rly matter
[1:45:05] bombi1996: Mage tower still avaible?
[1:45:09] Sollice: Morning
[1:45:10] Atolanos: @Thoreya but he didnt heal up so its not a legit kill
[1:45:15] DrakhanGaming: They’re taking no dmg lol
[1:45:16] Creative_Pigeon: @bombi1996 up permanent now.
[1:45:26] bombi1996: cool
[1:45:45] jerexify: Try fury warrior!
[1:45:47] PotbellyGoat: towHAMUP
[1:45:48] CritcobainTV: The unholy DK one is kinda cool
[1:45:49] Atolanos: @Thoreya it does matter ha. they had an 8% health lose on jailer. that matters. no one would have given them WF with that
[1:45:50] The_Metal_Man: the brew one's easy af
[1:45:52] Sicknessqt: This boss always enrage on me at like 10% KEKW
[1:45:52] Creative_Pigeon: fury warrior
[1:45:54] misomander: imp mother
[1:45:54] faulen: try the rogue
[1:45:56] Zeke_nl: the worm one is probabaly pretty easy
[1:46:02] Creative_Pigeon: imp mother
[1:46:02] Thanistrom: @Towelliee yeah but hes more difficult
[1:46:02] jerexify: An imp mother fight. Single phase, lots of imps.
[1:46:04] misomander: ww monk/bm hunter is kinda easy
[1:46:06] wEiRdO_dUdE: Yeah fury does imp mother
[1:46:06] Zeke_nl: agatha is easy as hell
[1:46:11] Zeke_nl: fury war

[1:46:15] CritcobainTV: Unoly DK
[1:46:20] gretzwaah: Outlaw rogue has imp mother
[1:46:24] Creative_Pigeon: fury warrior is imp mother
[1:46:25] JokaThS: fire mage
[1:46:28] pavepawns: fury is easymode
[1:46:31] KaisenSiru: Feral druid
[1:46:33] Armdel: Agatha is just single target with imps spawns
[1:46:33] wEiRdO_dUdE: Should work at 50 but it will be tougher
[1:46:34] Atolanos: i FOUND lvl 52 EASIER ON MY fURY wAR
[1:46:36] Zeke_nl: fury or unholy is easiest
[1:46:38] Atolanos: oops caps
[1:46:45] misomander: fire mage is the easiest imp mother by far. the scaling isnt right
[1:46:45] Creative_Pigeon: I did it at 60 with double crusader

[1:49:17] boopbopbamski: ooffff i know liquid doesnt care unless its first but after alll of last nights pulls and no kill and with another guild taking 3rd
[1:49:25] Creative_Pigeon: only the class you get it on, but any of that class on your account
[1:49:57] wEiRdO_dUdE: I think they nerfed crusader again

[1:50:28] The_Dane_Train: Healing from dual crusader definitely helps.
[1:50:43] mavericks312: from a healer aspect they could use an upgrade
[1:50:46] boopbopbamski: ya still the best NA guild I just wonder how they fill at the current line up of players wonder if we will see a change
[1:50:59] Creative_Pigeon: it sucks cause they did well but just fucked over IRL stuff.
[1:51:05] Creative_Pigeon: and that killed morale
[1:51:16] wEiRdO_dUdE: Before I would have said double crusader but I don't know right now
[1:51:22] nc716: they have the if its not first ur last mentality i guess
[1:51:30] sintax_24: Liquid seemed to lack in strategy this tier too
[1:51:35] CanadianCataclysm: There the top NA guild
[1:51:49] Niksen_99: Whats first step when hitting 60 is it to complete all 3 campaigns ?
[1:52:00] CritcobainTV: You're off centered 😡
[1:52:07] CritcobainTV: @nilone4
[1:52:12] Darthyrevan: Whos the next NA guild close to Liquid?

[1:52:28] faulen: BDGG
[1:52:30] Zeke_nl: echo got 500mil to pay back. i thnk liquid has something like 720
[1:52:31] Creative_Pigeon: probably bdgg
[1:52:31] waynef1985: is mage tower up all the time now?
[1:52:32] suarkosaur: Liquid still hasn't killed The Jailer yet?
[1:52:48] lieutenantdan416: You think steve owner of liquid going to be peeved at their performance or just happy about the views?
[1:52:55] sintax_24: id love to see BDGG beat liquid to jailer
[1:53:03] Naturalbeef: Not caring isn't a great mentality to have for a WF guild
[1:53:04] ItsNobbie: Have fun Liquid farming all that gold for a World 4th (or worse) LUL
[1:53:18] Eviltuna13: The sponsors might look at humm only 6-8k on the main channel and 20-30k on Maxes let rethink our position
[1:53:32] CritcobainTV: kill imps
[1:53:39] wEiRdO_dUdE: Those little ones heal her or something
[1:53:40] cazhually: yeah if oyu told me liquid was going to be world 3rd or world 4th maybe worse this tier... i would've told you that you were insane
[1:53:42] PotbellyGoat: I'm surprised how good the Factor meals look
[1:53:42] CritcobainTV: u have to kill all the imps, it's an add control fight
[1:53:43] Zeke_nl: adds over boss
[1:53:49] cazhually: such an odd end result for liquid
[1:53:57] glixxster: Do you have the EN 1st boss trinket?
[1:54:34] CodeMasterr: they built different
[1:54:35] Moobot: Did you know this drop was designed in Photoshop? Students get the whole Adobe Creative suitefor just $19.99/month http://www.adobe.com/creativecloud/buy/students.html
[1:54:49] CodeMasterr: LUL
[1:54:52] Creative_Pigeon: I mean it helps that EU has an over abundance of PTO vs the US not giving a fuck about workers lol
[1:54:53] pavepawns: we are messed up us eu ppl
[1:54:54] Senthius09: i think if liquid doesnt have the problems they had at the end with the hotels, and losing players, they take second close behind echo
[1:54:57] Eviltuna13: @nobbie01 they will make the money back because they are the only US based guild. Lol
[1:55:02] Nickbick17: Nickbick17 subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 27 months! 
[1:55:02] mavericks312: ah so jordan the goat confirmed

[1:56:05] The_Dane_Train: MJ the baseball player obviously.
[1:56:29] Recruitie: you can use the roar that slows those 2 adds that walk in too I think
[1:56:32] CritcobainTV: I love Michael B Jordan, he's  great football player
[1:56:40] glixxster: The trinket from the first boss in EN just destroys MT trials.
[1:56:54] nc716: this becomes a lot easier if u go get the ravaged seed pod from the first boss in emerald nightmare. the adds melt
[1:56:55] c0mmander_starscream: they don't have anything on Korea guilds
[1:56:56] Niksen_99: Short raids then it would only be fair to have world wide launch
[1:57:03] 91Niki: Hello Towelliee and chat towHi
[1:57:12] CritcobainTV: @91Niki morning niki
[1:57:16] Creative_Pigeon: NA players have to deal with less than 14 days of PTO on average. They're not all professional streamers.
[1:57:20] mavericks312: liquids problem is consistency
[1:57:28] Creative_Pigeon: Life just gets in the way.
[1:57:29] DuploThief: Rogerbrown has 16 now
[1:57:33] misomander: i feel bad for jpc, was his first rwf and he was definitely feeling the pressure on some bosses after all those days raiding

[1:58:45] Garrek__: @wolvepg the name echo is... the players are not... used to be Method players
[1:58:49] Thoreya: liquid also brings in like 6 new players every tier whereas echo keeps it mostly the same team
[1:58:55] Thoreya: that may be an issue
[1:59:32] Niksen_99: We need world wide launch for sure
[1:59:38] Scoodles91: the imps are healing her
[1:59:39] sintax_24: liquid tries to get the 'best players' where echo has amazing players that have all played with each other forever
[1:59:41] panzmat: that cast needed to be interrupted
[1:59:42] xire78: can start killing the big 2 farther back in the room
[1:59:46] sintax_24: liquid ends up butting heads
[1:59:54] abracka_: these challenges seem way harder than they were in legion
[2:00:17] sintax_24: thats what i said
[2:00:42] 24sevn: Blizzard, nerf the mage tower!
[2:00:42] Moobot: Towelliee is playing on Server US EAST - UNA for Lost Ark!
[2:00:47] ArcaneSyntax: in Legion you could outgear it lol
[2:01:24] pereadin: They will, look at Xyronic
[2:01:28] Naturalbeef: You need to farm SoO gear for the Mage Tower
[2:01:31] mavericks312: hell they sat gingi
[2:01:41] CritcobainTV: yeah im down
[2:01:41] 91Niki: I'm drinking Wompa fruit Gfuel, mixed with blueberry sugar free soda. This is an odd mix LUL
[2:01:47] CrusaderNero: farm old xpac gear to do mage tower? no way
[2:01:57] waynef1985: yeah most people who did mage tower in legion did it with 1 or 2 teirs of gear over what it was released at

[2:02:00] Niksen_99: I mean if you want to be world first you have to be harsh and replace
[2:02:07] Thrixel: @mavericks312 hunter was bad on some bosses
[2:02:10] CritcobainTV: @91Niki monkaS
[2:02:14] Eviltuna13: sacNOPERS no friends when it comes to World First Rave sacNOPERS

[2:02:33] Eviltuna13: Race*
[2:03:00] abracka_: @biorrwolf basically. survey was sent out
[2:03:19] Thoreya: sounds like lebron changing his roster every year. sometimes it doesnt work
[2:03:33] mavericks312: recruiting an using the best players are 2 different things
[2:03:55] Shrenko: @Biorrwolf it has been basically ''confirmed '' since tbc
[2:04:13] wEiRdO_dUdE: Gotta do like all 20's to get those 278 conduits, or something like that
[2:05:07] DuploThief: but they said they where the number one guild in the world
[2:05:08] Thoreya: more than 1 guild did better tho lol
[2:05:09] abracka_: they still performed well. didn’t they get first kill on every boss aside from first/last?
[2:05:12] Aduka84: what happened is people had to go home and couldnt stay for a 2 week race
[2:05:16] Thoreya: i think thats a problem, esp for the players
[2:05:17] CrusaderNero: in over 1 year LUL
[2:05:23] CritcobainTV: D: You mean to tell me if i name my paladin Towelliee i won't instantly be a better atnk?
[2:05:26] dimofodi: One guild was season gritty veterans of the race, born it in. The other, baby faces, merely adapting to it. :D

[2:05:37] sintax_24: liquid still isnt even close
[2:05:53] Shrenko: @QuigsTV not true :D
[2:06:15] Naturalbeef: If we're going to really be honest, Liquid only won the 2 races because Method collapsed and they had to rebuild as Echo
[2:06:36] mavericks312: and really if liquid didint struggle on lords it could have been diffrent
[2:07:12] KaisenSiru: YEP

[2:11:00] Niksen_99: Scripe is not doing another race if there isnt a world wide launch
[2:11:02] dimofodi: Liquid may not have had a tanking spot for him.
[2:11:06] Zeke_nl: he seems to not give much of a crap
[2:11:09] jking1087: AT the time they didnt have a tank spot
[2:11:13] QuigsTV: @towelliee I still find it impressive that method had their issue and disbanded and a few tiers after that they’re back to being world 2nd
[2:11:14] jking1087: bdgg did

[3:13:24] PraxicThorn: @91Niki KEKW
[3:13:30] Templexx: lmao
[3:13:42] Niksen_99: Did you have a 4-5 month break? what did you play then
[3:13:51] jasonabchooper: can you play wow without addon?
[3:13:57] m_sk_: That or the fact it was not a good moment to support Blizz and you stepped away until dust settled lmao
[3:13:57] Heyhowsitgoingtonight: no
[3:14:01] Lexi__Marie: was the tank that tanked for you on your break happy to swap to another role
[3:14:16] 91Niki: @jasonabchooper 100%. But only on the extreme casual level.
[3:14:22] duffluv22: Do you still have that artwork with you and the gang before Shadowlands?? Thats was a cool piece.
[3:14:26] RedXIII: I just started playing retail again like 2 days ago. I got into normal raid with my guild and left with 3/5 tier already :P
[3:14:33] racketpunch: I’d love to come back to wow only my guild of 10+ years disbanded in SL. I can’t get myself to look for a new one. It’s not the same.
[3:14:37] doomester: yes
[3:14:42] smashwow: yep
[3:14:51] Heyhowsitgoingtonight: slootHmm
[3:15:03] fistofnature: @jasonabchooper you can, but the higher difficulty of content you play addons become more important
[3:15:04] smashwow: spiteful will go on a tank if no one else is around
[3:15:05] 91Niki: sacHMM
[3:15:22] mobbo: Just pony out
[3:15:30] 91Niki: But science is so much fun !!
[3:15:37] jasonabchooper: when does wow decide to let player add addon?
[3:15:39] Heyhowsitgoingtonight: towelliee are you getting a 3090ti?
[3:15:42] smashwow: lol niki gets it
[3:15:44] LoNg_LiVe_RoLLs: lol I always feign when I get agro. No matter what I get it from. Sorry if I've killed a tank
[3:16:22] 91Niki: @jasonabchooper It's not build into wow. You gotta add files to the addon folder manually, or use a third party program to add addons
[3:16:55] KragnosWoW: KEKW
[3:17:17] 91Niki: @jasonabchooper Either via CurseForge or WowUp
[3:17:26] TheCheeseWheel87: yeah if they are going to time gate it to 1/per week, then they should have released Creation Catalyst already.
[3:17:26] smashwow: probably shouldn't bring in the commander
[3:17:33] KragnosWoW: can we use tier in mage tower now?
[3:17:42] Bennodkk: that's what i do
[3:17:44] smashwow: commanders usually have an aura that reduces AOE damage done
[3:17:45] Bennodkk: :))
[3:18:01] Mallaes: FailFish
[3:18:02] 91Niki: I miss the feral version of feign death. Cower. Man that was fun! I killed a lot of mages in cata with that ability KEKW
[3:18:14] TheCheeseWheel87: @KragnosWoW i believe the tier effect is disabled
[3:18:24] smashwow: LOL
[3:18:29] Niksen_99: I just got flying in shadowlands... its amazing
[3:18:30] axiits: LUL LUL LUL
[3:18:34] KragnosWoW: I like to misdirect warlocks out of spite
[3:19:42] 91Niki: It was so easy to get aggro as a feral in cata, and then you just hit cower, and if there was a mage in the group, you could be certain that mage got wacked and died KEKW
[3:19:48] duffluv22: Woah woah...why the warlock hate...lol
[3:19:55] RedXIII: I love how easy Zerith Mortis flying was to unlock
[3:20:14] smashwow: yeah
[3:20:22] smashwow: 2 orbs then move
[3:20:27] 91Niki: If there was no mage in the group, it was just the next melee that took the fall
[3:20:38] 91Niki: I really miss cower FeelsBadMan
[3:20:42] Niksen_99: Is it just the campaign? @RedXIII

[3:50:11] Deadcells: It’s a stupid glitch blizzard wont fix
[3:50:11] pavepawns: also do we have any idea what the wow mobile could potentially be?
[3:50:36] Deadcells: They list their gambit key and it comes up as a streets in the group finder
[3:50:58] 91Niki: @pavepawns Yep, that's why not everyone can have a sword
[3:51:27] pavepawns: why wont u let me poke myself to death!
[3:51:46] faulen: !9-5 Challenge P.R.E.P
[3:51:46] Moobot: @faulen The first goal of the subathon is the WoW 9-5 challenge! Towelliee plays WoW on a brand new account with no help and as if he had a 9-5 normal job. So only about 4-5 hours a day to see how far a normal person can really get in today's WoW
[3:51:56] SmokedHog: doesn't make sense now
[3:52:29] FergusCreative: fish dicks?
[3:52:30] 91Niki: You gotta eat them
[3:52:45] smashwow: tarter sauce
[3:52:46] JediNeo99999: they're totems, you can't aoe them
[3:52:46] 91Niki: That's how i get rid of fish sticks. I eat them
[3:52:59] faulen: !Project 60

[3:55:31] SmokedHog: party is drawing mushroom tips with the gold line lol
[3:55:35] Gingerprimer: @KragnosWoW you open the vault do a slash simc
[3:55:42] jpwastaken_: if u open ur vault and then /simc copy paste that into raidbots you can choose the items in top gear

[3:56:43] kariwew: @Towelliee how are you going to get 3k doing +15s?
[3:57:06] SmokedHog: do you use bigwigs + littlewigs
[3:57:08] KragnosWoW: oh nvm it wont let me unless im a sub to raidbots

[4:00:29] Ripten: I just had shredded pork with corn
[4:00:34] 91Niki: @DannyG757 Just use whatever you prefer! I think Towelliee swapped cuz their guild uses bigwigs. So it's the raid leader that makes the call which one they use in that case.
[4:00:41] KragnosWoW: nice, i havent had that one
[4:01:01] Ripten: Im trying to lose weight so most of the meals I select are low in carbs
[4:01:18] KragnosWoW: ill be having grilled chicken vesuvio soon
[4:01:31] DannyG757: @91niki for sure makes sense

[4:05:01] Deadcells: Ripten I did the same thing yesterday
[4:05:13] Ripten: ive been told i sound like towelliee and then my friends are like "you should stream" and I say "yeah cuz sounding like towelliee is all it takes riiiiiiight"
[4:05:46] Orirholim: Towelliee is OG. Been around since JTV.
[4:05:57] Ripten: people that dont stream that think streaming is easy are like people that think QA is not needed.
[4:06:04] UnHungHero1: whats the 20day timer counting down
[4:06:04] Ripten: drives me crazy
[4:06:24] Ripten: i remember justin tv lol
[4:06:26] mavericks312: in 10.0 id like to see enchanted vellums become account bound
[4:06:27] KragnosWoW: the days before wow officially dies Kappa
[4:06:39] 91Niki: @Ripten Yeaaah, it takes a lot to get to the top these days. You either need an insane amount of luck, or roots elsewhere to bring followers over to streaming
[4:07:10] nickie6x: hey towelliiee. I am a falcons fan, was curious how you felt about getting Matty Ice for your colts?
[4:08:14] shadowghostytv: Ripten, if you think streaming is hard work then you definitely dont enjoy streaming
[4:08:25] Ripten: isTowelliee still in DJ?
[4:08:54] Ripten: @shyshuki what i meant by that is i dont assume that someones job is easy. that is all

[4:09:23] 91Niki: Has been for a few years now
[4:09:27] shadowghostytv: I wouldnt call sitting and playing games that you enjoy is hard work :P well thats my opinion D:
[4:09:42] shadowghostytv: and i just learned a new emote by mistake, not bad lol
[4:09:44] KragnosWoW: friends... FeelsBadMan what are those..
[4:09:46] 91Niki: @shyshuki You clearly haven't tried streaming then LUL
[4:10:12] Maydie6066: @91Niki wait.. when did Towelliee start playing horde Kappa
[4:10:14] KragnosWoW: the most daunting part of streaming is fkin up my throat talking for 8 hours every day
[4:10:15] Quadster: When is the new world x adobe drop?
[4:10:18] duffluv22: And then Sephiroth shows up with meteor
[4:10:52] Ripten: i think there is more to being a successful streamer then just sitting down and playing games with your cam and mic on. You have to deal with third party vendors and work out contracts and entertain viewers day in and day out plus i am sure a lot more that i am not even thinking of
[4:10:55] shadowghostytv: Niki, i have. for a long time. I dont find it hard at all, i do what i enjoy. Simple as. :)
[4:11:13] 91Niki: @shyshuki Have you done it as your main source of income?
[4:11:41] KragnosWoW: from what ive seen. majority of successful streamers did it as a hobby first

[4:12:11] shadowghostytv: Niki, no.
[4:12:17] 91Niki: Right, one thing is streaming as a hobby with a main income on the side. Another is being successful and using streaming as your main source of income. Now THAT isn't easy
[4:12:19] propwash80: @Towelliee what ever happened to malfurion? did he die?
[4:12:43] shadowghostytv: Niki, well for once you dont start streaming to get income. That comes overtime.
[4:12:58] Gurtogg: LUL
[4:12:59] shadowghostytv: IF you get successfull that is
[4:13:14] 91Niki: @shyshuki Right, and that part isn't easy ;)
[4:13:15] c0mmander_starscream: Silvanis rocking that Kardashian ass
[4:13:26] 91Niki: That isn't just sitting on your butt playing video games
[4:13:41] KragnosWoW: Kappa just have a full time job on the side and make accounts that sub and dono using ur own income
[4:13:48] Gurtogg: POGGERS

[4:14:10] jerexify: @Towelliee Different.
[4:14:27] shadowghostytv: Niki, there is alot of diffrent opinions on that part, so im not going in to that. Lets just agree to disagree :)
[4:14:31] TheLoho: Recolor
[4:14:33] jerexify: @Towelliee Different color scheme.
[4:14:34] Nibbel__: hard mode is gold
[4:14:36] mavericks312: towel out here getting mounts he never knew existed
[4:14:37] dimofodi: It's just a re-skin

[4:15:55] Gurtogg: towle and his streamer luck..
[4:16:06] jpwastaken_: classic streamer luck
[4:16:07] 91Niki: Gotta love when 1 viewer andys comes into the stream and says streaming isn't hard. Good laugh of the day LUL
[4:16:17] jpwastaken_: 2 mythic tier pieces from vault and mount on 2nd gambit
[4:16:19] Gillrad: I've seen so many of that mount drop its actually 1-2%. Could be just lucky
[4:16:27] shadowghostytv: Towellie what mouse do you have?
[4:16:28] TheLoho: some people just walk in the light

[4:17:29] Heero_Effect: Asmongold preaching how you shouldn’t pay credit card debt. Just transfer to another credit card….

[4:17:48] KragnosWoW: @91Niki Donation button and 0 followers. hate to laugh but i did KEKW
[4:18:15] tentakos: i waz suprised how good logitech wireless mouses are
[4:18:19] shadowghostytv: i got a razer naga but it take so long to get used to using the buttons lol
[4:18:28] extrnl2: logitech make very good mice
[4:18:34] 91Niki: I'm still looking for a decent wireless mouse. The ones that have the shape I like has shitty battery life
[4:18:54] 91Niki: And I don't want that charging pad bs that Logitech is rocking
[4:18:58] Deadcells: I use a razer tartarus now
[4:19:01] shadowghostytv: niki, logitech g305
[4:19:04] shadowghostytv: i got that, its amazing
[4:19:06] Deadcells: I love it
[4:19:15] shadowghostytv: my battery last long over a month
[4:19:24] 91Niki: It's too small @shyshuki
[4:19:28] FergusCreative: Xbox has it so whats the big deal
[4:19:34] shadowghostytv: then you need a space ship mouse :p
[4:19:35] c0mmander_starscream: what happened with PS?

[4:20:16] KragnosWoW: I binged watched all of Severance last night, good ass show, cant wait for season 2
[4:20:33] xXSiebzehnXx: worth for that yerah

[4:21:35] mavericks312: NA wont see it till atleast the fall JP gets it first
[4:21:40] ShieldslamTV: LOD Kreygasm
[4:21:50] KragnosWoW: are the ps5s still hard to get?
[4:21:55] mavericks312: LoD alone would make it worth it
[4:22:19] mavericks312: @KragnosWoW digitals not so much
[4:22:24] bumpstock75: red alert ?
[4:22:37] FergusCreative: Amazon had digital PS5. sold out in less than 5min
[4:22:47] CritcobainTV: we joined a new group u can come in
[4:23:18] 91Niki: @KragnosWoW Eh, yes and no. It requires some digging and keeping eyes out a lot. You gotta keep an eye out on the sales when happen. I follow https://twitter.com/videogamedeals . They always announce all the PS5 sales
[4:23:32] duffluv22: Got mine at the PX...lol
[4:23:32] mavericks312: ive been trying to get a disc ps5 for a minute
[4:23:32] Schult2y: @towelliee We have been giving our GM a hard time all week. He was the mage you wrote down and his main is a DK. He is actually a really good tank. Was watching the stream and came back to the chaos 😂🤣

[4:24:04] ReynaMarxx: I got my PS5 on launch but i had to drive half way across the state to pick up 1 of 5 models they had at target
[4:24:09] 91Niki: I got two friends of mine a PS5 by giving them links when they happened, via https://twitter.com/videogamedeals posting them. You can also sign up to Playstations own website, to get emails when they go on sale.
[4:24:09] CritcobainTV: KEKW
[4:24:09] devilhawk83: I know at my local Walmart, they still got some Xbox Series S in stock, but getting a PS5 is pretty much a lost cause
[4:24:23] CritcobainTV: Dudes ego, kicking everyone on last boss
[4:24:39] mavericks312: yea xboxs are easy to find lol
[4:24:41] KragnosWoW: he kicked u guys?
[4:24:55] xluckydawgx: new Game of Thrones spin off August 21st

[4:25:07] KragnosWoW: are ps5s that amazing that theyre that rare?
[4:25:23] chiefiskeith: my dogs whine pierces the brain
[4:25:51] 91Niki: @KragnosWoW Hey got good exclusives and people love Sony. It's a money maker for scalpers. That's why they're still hard to get
[4:25:55] 91Niki: they *
[4:26:06] KragnosWoW: im only asking because i havent had a console since xbox 360 and ps3
[4:27:12] 91Niki: @KragnosWoW As someone who loves their exclusives, I say it's worth it. But don't pay the bs ebay prices. Rather hunt them down as the sales happen. There's often the GameStop membership sales, or Local pickups
[4:27:14] pereadin: @Schult2y His tank is in the blackbook as well
[4:27:38] MILESkg21: my ps4 is just a dust collector now 4Head

[5:08:48] DragonofWolves: Towelliee, do you think Blizzard should try backing off from borrowed power systems in 10.0? Nothing good seems to be coming from them imo
[5:10:54] dimofodi: If they do another system like this, they just need to make them all available at all times after leveling, not switching dragonflights, just all abilities at all times.

[5:11:52] mavericks312: whats scary is turalyon leading the alliance next xpac
[5:12:03] dimofodi: If they make it just like covenants they need to improve on it by making it a tab like talents to swap, no more going to a forge or going to a person to change etc
[5:12:04] CritcobainTV: @Orirholim They'll probably bake half our covenant and conduit shit into abilities
[5:12:06] DragonofWolves: bobby_knock are you on mobile?
[5:12:08] SilkeySmooth: tier pieces should be in heroic/mythic raid only

[5:34:02] thomaspxo: I'm pretty sure you need to move north and east
[5:34:07] happybooger: @Towelliee let me show you
[5:34:11] DragonofWolves: shiryux91 I'd say so if it was the MDI, because thats technically an Esport, RWF technically isn't an Esport.
[5:34:13] PoppaShot: You’re in the complete wrong area
[5:34:20] Shifthappens192: You are in the wrong area
[5:34:27] PoppaShot: He spawns in a field
[5:35:35] faulen: the grass 4Head
[5:35:35] arasiel16: lol
[5:35:37] DishChi: LUL
[5:35:53] DishChi: Yes here
[5:36:32] giggz91: @dragonofwolves I mean they still have revenue involved. But yea just my opinion.
[5:36:32] Eviltuna13: More like in a meadow cohhFee
[5:37:20] Biotechz: some days he isn't up
[5:37:35] DishChi: Not everyday spawns
[5:37:42] raptorstrick: He has a big green slime trail
[5:39:12] DragonofWolves: shiryux91 True, and it is your opinion which I get. But the MDI is held by blizzard, RWF is sponsered by other companies, and not blizzard. Thats how I see it. Max couldn't have foreseen this.
[5:39:13] MeisterPetze: marathon to world fist
[5:39:21] DishChi: Any thoughts on Slyvanas ending?
[5:39:31] Ldysansa: Ya it is harsher
[5:39:56] DishChi: True
[5:40:10] smashwow: if they just leave her there, that'd be fine too
[5:40:16] CaptainJack5177: @Towelliee what are you using for your personal bars? I'm dps so I didn't want to import the whole tanking addon package
[5:41:14] thomaspxo: it is not a sport or a game by definition. it is a strange elixir or a marathon starting at different times on different continents with any regulations on equipment , funding , or competitive balance
[5:41:21] JediNeo99999: It's very hard on non-streamers too who have to take PTO for an unknown number of days
[5:41:39] 91Niki: @CaptainJack5177 He uses elvui. If you mean the buffs uptimers of his abilities. that's luxthos weakauras
[5:42:01] CaptainJack5177: Thanks @91Niki I was curious about the personal and target bars he is using!
[5:42:01] Ldysansa: That why it's so harsh but very rewarding for the winners
[5:42:11] pigzip: @towelliee flex the war bear
[5:42:27] DragonofWolves: Plus I think most RWF players are full time streamers, so that takes into effect also.
[5:42:43] 91Niki: @CaptainJack5177 KUI nameplates? I think or Plater. It's one of those
[5:42:52] glowlighttv: 100% if you hasve lure
[5:42:57] 91Niki: !wa
[5:42:58] Moobot: @91Niki we use Luxthos's WeakAuras! You can find all his WAs at wago.io/search/luxthos |You can find the leveling EXP bar here! | wago.io/LuxthosExperienceBar
[5:43:18] CaptainJack5177: i have plater, i just can't figure out how to set my personal health bar. tiured of the blizzard frame
[5:43:29] DishChi: Arthas Sadge
[5:43:50] RageerPLZ: yea
[5:43:51] RageerPLZ: it's rng
[5:43:57] 91Niki: @CaptainJack5177 Personal health bar for towelliee is elvui
[5:44:06] RageerPLZ: the good thing is that 3 rares spawn in that area
[5:44:12] RageerPLZ: you can farm the worms for helmix while waiting
[5:45:06] CaptainJack5177: thanks so much!
[5:45:56] thomaspxo: trill must have a contract with Arena cups and RWF
[5:45:57] DragonofWolves: Well don't both Max and THDLock stream full time, or don't they?
[5:46:05] TiredCarcass: Im so mixed about liquid,  good to take care of mental issues, but not really try after they got back kind of feels disapointing
[5:46:22] Ldysansa: Wouldn't a contact for that be similar to an NBA or NFL players contract?
[5:46:52] theDirtyon3: yea people are just shitting on them because they didnt win at this point
[5:47:10] FergusCreative: Theyre so burnt out man thye just want it over with
[5:47:18] Ldysansa: Oh ya ok
[5:47:26] 91Niki: Yeah exactly @FergusCreative
[5:47:27] BIGxTPx23: has anyone beatin the Mythic raid yet? Sorry if already discussed
[5:47:39] BIGxTPx23: beaten*
[5:47:40] ProfessorChaoos: I honestly just want to see the new reveal next month
[5:47:47] Orirholim: All that difficulty after 16 hours a day, double legendary and everyone having 4 tier... I honestly don't blame them for making the decision.
[5:47:49] xmedpakx: stuck with 3 peice this week... doh
[5:48:02] Orirholim: Blame Blizzard for tuning. Halondrus was nuts.

[5:50:17] ProfessorChaoos: What BLizzard games do you think will never be on game pass once Microsoft deal goes through
[5:50:20] 91Niki: That's kinda like hating on a company as a whole, cuz of one dumb social media managers comment.
[5:50:54] 91Niki: POGGERS
[5:51:51] Mock34: liquid just saw P4

[5:57:13] purrfecto: do they still get more lockouts that na and eu?

[5:57:39] MayroVision: Look… Sylvannis is walking so the Detroit Lions can run the NFC North this year!!!
[5:57:53] AESAlbero: Cheer1  hi
[5:57:56] waynef1985: does anyone know if the world 3rd kill only healed to 9% in last phase like methods kill?
[5:58:19] duffluv22: And the STEELERS running the AFC NORTH
[5:58:22] N3llee: it healed for less then method
[5:58:25] ThePawPaw: NO
[5:58:25] happybooger: @Towelliee how do you think not publicly testing the last 3 bosses went? Do you think Blizz will do something like that again?
[5:58:26] Ldysansa: When bad times come along for a team this when you find out who are the real fans and which ones are the fair weather fans.
[5:58:31] ThePawPaw: Skyline healed up to 19%
[5:58:54] N3llee: are you sure
[5:58:58] xziyn: @Towelliee neos0923 is the twitch handle
[5:59:01] N3llee: i heard it was less then methods kill
[5:59:08] ThePawPaw: it was icyveins and wowhead twitted from what i saw
[5:59:08] Collected1: 20 DAYS HYPE
[5:59:10] Collected1: LETS GOOOOOO

[6:00:54] ThePawPaw: yup
[6:00:55] alextheory_: didnt heal back up for the kill tho
[6:00:56] Moobot: towHAMUP Follow Towelliee on twitter so you can be in the know at all times! | twitter.com/towelthetank towKawaii
[6:00:56] Bennodkk: on thier kill he didn't
[6:00:58] ThePawPaw: 19% is normal
[6:01:04] Shrenko: is that a fire mage
[6:01:25] 91Niki: @Shrenko yes
[6:01:30] Murry07: But when they killed him, he healed only to 11%
[6:01:42] pereadin: Sylvanas takes 5% more to kill, Jailer gets a bubble heal KEKW
[6:01:46] waynef1985: i felt so bad for method they got kinda shafted with that heal bug, hard to celebrate a world 2nd when it happens like that
[6:01:59] JediNeo99999: Raider IO reported"Skyline also seems to have benefited from the bug that makes the boss not heal properly. In their kill, the Jailer only healed to 11%, whereas in all their previous P4 pulls he healed to 19% instead."

[6:06:33] abracka_: they separated the consciousness of a person so they “change” personas when they start their work day. it’s a pretty fucked show but really good
[6:06:37] alantin77: well work and home are seperate Towellies in that Tv show Severance
[6:06:40] ThePawPaw: @N3llee so yeah about the kill of Skyline not sure but i saw the boss healing up to 19% posts then they killed it so yeah whatever it is what it is...hope next tier they will test more of the raids and stuff
[6:07:02] FergusCreative: are the ilvl cypher upgrades account wide?

[6:08:44] DallTV_: @Collected1 realy cux of the slap ? :o
[6:08:46] abracka_: just go tom holland mode and spoil it for us
[6:08:49] JumpTroopC5: @towelliee it would be cool if they had another level to the raid difficulty called WorldFirst which locks in the difficulty at whatever it was initially beat at so other guilds can try it after greasing up.
[6:08:59] DragonofWolves: MilesKG21 doing college and working lmao

[6:14:38] pereadin: @oldmanmitch sadly no
[6:14:55] N3llee: o damn
[6:14:56] DragonofWolves: OldManMitch no just cross faction groups. Hopefully cross faction guilds in 10,0
[6:14:59] TooLock: they will probably change it
[6:15:02] Collected1: they'll shut down that asap

[6:19:40] 91Niki: !9-5
[6:19:41] Moobot: @91Niki The first goal of the subathon is the WoW 9-5 challenge! Towelliee plays WoW on a brand new account with no help and as if he had a 9-5 normal job. So only about 4-5 hours a day to see how far a normal person can really get in today's WoW
[6:20:07] Biotechz: rift was good until it went F2P
[6:20:22] Orirholim: True.
[6:20:31] mmo_kenna_: @91Niki Lmao 4-5 hours per day with 9-5. Try 1 hour
[6:20:52] Revelations45: @Towelliee you see the update to Kinetic Edge man
[6:20:54] 91Niki: @mmo_kenna_ Yep my boyfriend would say the same LUL
[6:21:04] Heyhowsitgoingtonight: 1-3 is more realistic

[6:24:03] Heyhowsitgoingtonight: Rev you still drink yourself into oblivion?
[6:24:03] Moobot: Towelliee is playing on Server US EAST - UNA for Lost Ark!
[6:24:59] mmo_kenna_: Is there any vid of Skyline jailer kill?
[6:25:29] xziyn: @mmo_kenna_ Just the last few secs
[6:25:46] jahari1986: did Liquid get second on Jailer kill? I just checked their stream and they're still in p4?
[6:25:47] Crowzcut: you going play elden ring
[6:26:05] kekepops: @jahari1986 method got 2nd

[6:26:26] warrenny: @jahari1986 They havent killed it afaik
[6:26:44] jahari1986: oh snap, really? that's really big ouch for them
[6:27:04] 91Niki: Aw maaan, Bruce Willis got diagnosed with aphasia FeelsBadMan
[6:27:06] Heyhowsitgoingtonight: they outnumber the us like 4 to 1
[6:27:19] Crowzcut: theres new rules out in china 10 hours day of gaming only init
[6:27:22] darkdestroz: I got my Fury warr mage tower done,
[6:27:34] xziyn: Uner 18 yo afaik
[6:27:47] darkdestroz: @Towelliee if u gonna do fury warr use Spiced falcosaur omelet as food,
[6:28:04] Crowzcut: @WMfLy ok
[6:28:10] warrenny: @nightblade19 Congratz i tried havoc earlier but wt actual f js that challenge
[6:28:17] happybooger: he is talking about the mage tower
[6:28:19] Heyhowsitgoingtonight: OMEGALUL
[6:28:41] 91Niki: That's for people under the age of 18
[6:28:50] kokochris: @crowzcut that rule is a guideline for younger than 18
[6:28:55] Crowzcut: under 18 the guy said in chat
[6:29:16] Heyhowsitgoingtonight: what's the point of a LAN center if you can play at home
[6:29:20] darkdestroz: @Towelliee for the Fury warrior mage tower challange if u are gonna do fury warr, used spiced falcosaur omelet as food it makes it easier.
[6:29:24] raldrik: its also china if you win world first in china lots of social credits
[6:29:43] glowlighttv: ...
[6:29:45] Heyhowsitgoingtonight: aphasia = loss of ability to understand or express speech, caused by brain damage
[6:29:56] Warpiercer: @raldrik +2000000000 Social Credits
[6:29:58] 91Niki: @Towelliee is a language disorder. Impacts your cognitive abilities.
[6:30:05] happybooger: speed increase when you kill something
[6:30:07] kekepops: he's retiring from acting
[6:30:12] happybooger: works well for the imps
[6:30:32] 91Niki: @Towelliee Not sure. I think you just won't be able to communicate anymore
[6:30:33] xziyn: Might be a huge event on Chinese websites for sponsors too, they have a crazy amount of esports orgs there. Like doesn't Skyline have a pretty good Dota 2 team?
[6:30:33] Myndjestyr: @nightblade19 what ilvl?
[6:30:35] FergusCreative: its just a loss of speaking or expressing yourself due to a stroke or head injury
[6:30:41] FergusCreative: usually cleared up with therapy
[6:30:43] pronkk_: no, its progressive and leads to no communicative ability
[6:30:46] darkdestroz: @Towelliee for each kill it grants movement speed, and since Fury warr challange is an add chalange it makes it easier,
[6:30:57] Crowzcut: free mounts all the shit

[6:33:18] xziyn: The new Mage Tower only gives the armor recolours right, not the artifact skins?
[6:33:34] darkdestroz: @WMfLy yes,
[6:33:34] Moobot: Did you know this drop was designed in Photoshop? Students get the whole Adobe Creative suitefor just $19.99/month http://www.adobe.com/creativecloud/buy/students.html
[6:33:35] Heyhowsitgoingtonight: that app sucked
[6:33:37] 2keeee: !wow
[6:33:55] kekepops: got the MT mount back in december. as someone who's never healed before, that one was the worst by far
[6:34:06] eyewal: what is the addon that plays those ding noises during raid attacks that all mythic raiders seem to use
[6:34:07] glowlighttv: lamme
[6:34:09] waynef1985: the lock one is sick
[6:34:10] Biotechz: the warrior one is nice, well arms warrior. not sure if it's the same for all of them.
[6:34:16] Heyhowsitgoingtonight: OMEGALUL
[6:34:23] xziyn: The rogue one is really cool too
[6:34:27] mmo_kenna_: I'm not hating but Liquid didn't just lose they have absolutely crumbled at the end of this race kinda sadge
[6:34:49] darkdestroz: @Biotechz u mean the armor for arms warr, yeh warr gets same on all classes.
[6:35:06] darkdestroz: if u are talking about the artifact skin then yeh itz different,
[6:35:27] Biotechz: yea just the set from completing it, love the look. Nice reskin of ToS set.
[6:35:47] Heyhowsitgoingtonight: imagine hitting enrage in lfr
[6:35:54] xziyn: The best recolor of that set was the pvp one, which you can't get anymore, sadly
[6:35:56] warrenny: @mmo_kenna_ How did they
[6:36:06] Gurtogg: will towel go ally side again for 9.2.5?
[6:36:17] xziyn: Dunno why pvp always gets the best colours lol
[6:36:34] eyewal: what is the addon that plays those ding noises during raid attacks that all mythic raiders seem to use
[6:36:50] Nehcrom: I remember LFR Nzoth that was a pure shitshow.
[6:36:50] xziyn: @eyerhonic Big Wigs or DBM
[6:36:58] grapyz: any fight that required any type of CC in lfr is alwasy a good time. I rember the huntsman in CN
[6:37:14] BlockishTiger: do you think a LFR tier piece will be better than a 252 or higher piece that isn't tier?
[6:37:31] warrenny: Going nm jailer tonight seems an intresting fight from the 3 attempts last week
[6:37:31] Stormrazer78: Surprised method got wf2
[6:37:36] Orirholim: tier set > item level
[6:37:38] kekepops: depends on class and set bonus
[6:37:45] darkdestroz: if the warrior reskin was a bit darker it wold be the Elite pvp set for warrs from legion season 3
[6:37:50] warrenny: @stormrazer78 its great tho nice recovery
[6:38:07] Heyhowsitgoingtonight: Method is back baby! @stormrazer78
[6:38:09] xziyn: @nightblade19 I'm still salty we can't buy it tbh
[6:38:53] Gurtogg: their commitment was crazy
[6:39:08] darkdestroz: @WMfLy true, some elite sets look sick not just for warr but other classes,
[6:39:48] Heyhowsitgoingtonight: Method WF in 10.0
[6:39:59] xziyn: @nightblade19 Yeah, doesn't make sense to have those locked. Especially since sets up till MoP (I think?) can be bought.
[6:40:21] ixiya_ink: !wow10

[6:40:34] warrenny: A thank fck its over type thing?
[6:40:41] Thoreya: watch liquid players leave for method LUL
[6:40:46] darkdestroz: @WMfLy well any sets pre bfa i think can be bought, just not the elite set,
[6:40:54] Gurtogg: Method was amazing at analyzing echo's/liquid's vid and copying their strats, not sure how good they are making their own strats
[6:41:05] Moobot: Towelliee is playing on Server US EAST - UNA for Lost Ark!
[6:41:18] Gingerprimer: Liquid was also pretty insane all the way up to Anduin and even on Rygalon
[6:41:18] kekepops: everyone gets a stay home
[6:41:33] waynef1985: i think naowh even left themand went home coz he wasnt feeling right
[6:41:34] xziyn: @nightblade19 The elite sets from WOTLK can be bought, though, no?
[6:41:47] Ldysansa: That is a good plan than when the other have to fly back the others are still playing
[6:42:01] Kisswani: what's this prime gaming + warcraft thing ? danHuh
[6:42:06] Moobot: Ask a moderator for permission before posting a link, @mysticflyy (warning)
[6:42:40] Mysticflyy: lol  put a . in 2 words and it said it was a link. sry
[6:42:41] darkdestroz: @WMfLy if u have pvp rating i think, same is with the recolour of Vanilla weps from area 52 in netherstorm, they are locked untill u get the right rating,
[6:42:56] 91Niki: @mysticflyy It's been know for a long time
[6:43:02] 91Niki: It's just taking effect now i guess
[6:43:36] CritcobainTV: Oh shit are you doing mythic on your dk? Kappa
[6:43:40] DevilSpire: So did liquid get the kill or did they take a break?
[6:43:45] R2RHIN0: We might have just seen the last large scale in person World First Race
[6:44:09] xziyn: @nightblade19 Honestly, I wouldn't even mind them being available if you get a certain rating. Not like now, where you needed the rating that season. Doesn't matter if you're glad now.
[6:44:15] JediNeo99999: Echo said in their interview they like getting everyone together
[6:44:20] kekepops: doubt blizzard will tune the next raid like this..
[6:44:25] Kisswani: @R2RHIN0 not sure about that , we wouldn't be having this conversation if the raid lasted 10 days or so
[6:44:30] uhtred_gaming: @Towelliee how much percentage wise would you say we would get cross faction guilds in 10.0?
[6:44:47] Gurtogg: sco said they wanna do a event again in 10.0
[6:44:53] mavericks312: idk i doubt liquid built that new venue for at home events
[6:45:00] Worgenrunt01: @Kisswani slootCreep
[6:45:06] BlockishTiger: @Towelliee I also don't see any raids being this long any time soon. so that may change things
[6:45:09] MistaHat: IDK. With it only happening one time..all the effort into the venue, seems off to not go back
[6:45:13] Kisswani: @Worgenrunt01 slootYum
[6:45:31] Erielle04: What is project 60?
[6:45:59] waynef1985: like you said its different for each player some people like the whole live on site thing with a grp and some dont
[6:46:00] xziyn: EU like it in general, might have a thing to do with people being in different countries, always fun to meet
[6:46:01] Ldysansa: Than bring them together for a celebration party that they could stream. Fans could buy tickets that would be cool and a good way to generate revenue
[6:46:15] Kisswani: EU peeps , is the cinematic crashing in game or that was only for NA yesterday ?
[6:46:24] darkdestroz: @Vantadaga project 60 is toweliee lvling all his chars to 60.
[6:46:58] Ldysansa: If they won lolo
[6:47:17] fistofnature: @Towelliee what does Blessing of spellwarding do against necrotic?
