[0:09:46] Kurama__95: Kurama__95 watched 40 consecutive streams this month and sparked a watch streak! I might be overcompensantion for the fact that I can't watch streams during the weekday outside of college vacations
[0:10:06] loralahla: hehe cat
[0:10:14] nyrhalahotep: cats, creating a degree of difficulty since the dawn of time

[0:10:43] jessetenfour: hi hazel! what we doin today?
[0:10:45] Ujai321: You sure find answers, but to what questions, that is the question

[0:20:25] Sunabubus: I wish vicious mount farm was a bit more... casualfriendly. By casual I mean I dont give a frick about x on x pvp but still want the mounts :D
[0:21:04] jgbrit: Hi Hazel, been working on my pet collection the last couple of days. Fairly new account so doing all the taming quests. Got my first 25 today 🙌
[0:21:25] amaya21: i want to go collect transmogs but maybe i should wait for War within? do you think they will work retroactively?
[0:21:33] ghostie1995: @sunabubus yes!! I feel that with all my heart
[0:23:29] amaya21: ah yes that would be a problem
[0:23:44] AhoyStumpy: I've avoided playing PvP since I started WoW 3 years ago.  Your explaining what you are doing here is helpful.  Is this stream available for replay later?
[0:26:06] Marovia: Hey Hazel, is it almost saturday today?
[0:27:01] diarrhea_lad: Have you done the Bloody Coins quest for the week already?
[0:28:02] cashthb: henlo

[0:30:28] LIZARD_1582: been a year since I've seen anything wow, that set is the coolest thing.
[0:30:38] Zurestel77: oooooooooooooo love the green wig!
[0:30:51] annettebrr: I’m too much of a wimp to try pvp. 😂
[0:31:25] Gurottesquex: That weapon could look really sick with that primal fire illusion.
[0:31:32] BoogiePonderosa: hi
[0:31:36] Zurestel77: question for y'all - I wanna swap mains....do I swap now and accept that I'll have half this season on another character or wait til S4?
[0:31:40] BoogiePonderosa: vicious moonbeast?
[0:31:41] Marovia: Hazel do you know if there are any shirts that are turtle necks?
[0:31:49] BoogiePonderosa: hazelOmg
[0:31:56] amaya21: can't wait to see the 3rd wig!
[0:32:09] Sunabubus: the pvp I like is battlegrounds. hiding in a big group and feel less stress about pvp tricks and hiding behind pillars and stuff
[0:32:24] rubibeya: Good morning 🙂
[0:33:04] Mattyboh: HAZEL!!!!! hi.
[0:33:12] TheDrnkDolphin: vicious moonbeast??

[0:34:12] cashthb: change the color!
[0:34:21] diarrhea_lad: gotta slay before you can slay
[0:34:28] Toiarc: I did Tyrs quest and now Im on my way to do Zaralek cavern. I havent played since it come but quit for months. I hope Im getting good quests there?
[0:34:30] amy_star_a: The right look will intimidate your opponents
[0:34:38] TheDrnkDolphin: how do u get the mount
[0:34:48] cashthb: don't
[0:34:52] Sunabubus: do you have all vicious mounts?
[0:35:47] BoogiePonderosa: is there an explainer out there on how to use Details? or a more intuitive mod?
[0:35:48] cashthb: how about quickly race changing her into a worgan?
[0:36:03] Ujai321: gesundheit
[0:36:28] BoogiePonderosa: ok
[0:36:28] cashthb: recount is simpler, but it was really buggy since 10.2
[0:36:42] Sunabubus: how may hours  you reckon takes to get one vicious saddle?

[0:37:14] BoogiePonderosa: @cashthb ok thanks :)
[0:37:26] Toiarc: You can click "Everything" and see how much dmg each enemy does. Can help when doing rares solo and dying to determine what enemy skill did most dmg.
[0:37:34] ghostie1995: does losing affect your mount progress?
[0:37:34] Toiarc: This in details.
[0:37:46] BugzBunnay: you should look into rated BGs on hunter you just flag sit lol
[0:37:48] nabilstendardo: does anyone do solo shuffle on an augvoker... that must be such a troll
[0:37:52] BoogiePonderosa: ok
[0:37:59] ghostie1995: I’ve been struggling to get to item level 473 I’ve been too lazy to
[0:38:18] ghostie1995: *do pvp
[0:38:40] Ujai321: we love bribes here at HazelNuttyGames
[0:39:06] Ujai321: yeah, weakauras are account wide (if not specificallyloaded for a character). she is a druid, after all
[0:39:07] Cyberwolffe: I'm finally going to start leveling my Holy Priest alt this weekend with Time Walking active.  I've said I was going to do this in the past, but I kept overthinking it and made myself too anxious about messing up but after all it wouldn't be the end of the world if I mess up and someone dies or we wipe while I'm healing.
[0:39:16] Toiarc: Im really dissapointed that you cant use additional resource when crafting tools to get better stats on them.
[0:39:48] cashthb: you prolly can get the full set from like 2-3 epic bg unless you get stomped out of the world
[0:39:55] BoogiePonderosa: the Devil is in Details!
[0:41:21] amaya21: yes!!
[0:41:22] ghostie1995: @cashthb I might try that. thanks!
[0:41:27] wolfcloudchaser80: @Cyberwolffe You said you were going to do this in the past, which is coming true, due to timewalking!
[0:41:27] Sunabubus: plumber must be the most random name for what it does with the seeds. So funny that you try to find an addon for seed planting and the one and only addon is called plumber
[0:41:34] bluecloud37: that warlock killed their felpuppy >:(
[0:41:41] Ujai321: you know how much someone would need to bribe you, according to your shirt? at least a buck.
[0:42:09] BoogiePonderosa: @Ujai321 LUL
[0:42:11] jeffdmk: bamn
[0:42:17] cashthb: that's not very bribe-y, you could make a daily "10 sub to feed the cat" one  instead or something similar
[0:42:17] Ujai321: dragon rage. avatar. bam! danger danger
[0:42:47] realicepick1: @HazelNuttyGames you should get some threat plates so you can see the enemeis vs teammates better while on the field of view
[0:42:52] Toiarc: I was doing BG and there was 3 different images of debuff. Im not sure whats causing this issue.
[0:42:53] BoogiePonderosa: did someone just drive a delorean at 88 mph?
[0:43:04] databob1: @hazelnuttygames the wigs look really good on you. I like your buzzed hair too but the wigs are very cute
[0:43:18] realicepick1: dont require any setup out of the box
[0:43:31] vharakh_17: did they speculate rdruid will experience big nerf for 10.2.5?
[0:43:47] Ujai321: enjoy wigs on stream, enjoy buzzcut off stream, enjoyment all around
[0:44:09] Ujai321: UNSPENT DRAGONRIDING GLYPHS!? are you not gaming optimall, miss nutty
[0:45:12] Mercilyss23: do you have an app that keeps addons up to date?
[0:45:16] Ujai321: thank you kindly
[0:45:19] cashthb: didn't watch, evoker has los thingy on the sides of the snaring thingy
[0:45:28] kynlaeh: pvp talent making deep breath put LOS of both sides of it
[0:45:51] wolfcloudchaser80: Now see, if they made a dragonriding PvP arena that resembled WWII era dogfighting, I'd actually PvP.
[0:46:00] Lunchador: Got em
[0:46:13] kynlaeh: it affects both friendly and enemy

[0:46:35] BoogiePonderosa: i think i've been accidentlly hitting alt F4 in raids.. which it turns out force quits applications
[0:46:43] Ujai321: imagine if we got dragonriding pvp, however many years after wotlk had it on their box
[0:46:45] Sunabubus: I dont evne know if you're winning or losing I'm so out of loop
[0:46:55] Braethune: don’t forget to switch your trinket on your bars in tree form
[0:47:07] BoogiePonderosa: wintergrasp would be more fun w/ dragon riding

[0:49:55] L3fis: Are you going for the gladiator mount?
[0:50:01] Sunabubus: what? -32c? I was complaining about our -10 this night. holy moly

[0:51:29] archermoo: It has actually warmed up for us. All the way up to 8C today. Snow isn't going to be until next week...

[0:53:43] Ujai321: but why worry about it if you cannot affect it?
[0:53:54] dergNwolf: I told it that it wasn't supposed to be out yet and get out of my sight, so it went to a colleague
[0:54:05] cashthb: well the climate was never stable and we got this far
[0:54:12] WhippWhapp: oh, we get to see bloodthirsty Hazel PeeVeePee PogChamp PogChamp
[0:54:23] fallingupwards: Are there any classes in particular that are easier to farm this mount in pvp? I main a brewmaster but I hate WW lol
[0:54:25] Lunchador: Oof
[0:54:31] Lunchador: Those PI goes

[0:55:55] alexandrunst: it's the uppies!
[0:55:59] realicepick1: @HazelNuttyGames did your addon just tell you power infusion was cast? what addon is that?
[0:56:02] kynlaeh: i feel like DH is a beginner friendly PVP since they just blow up everything and can jump around like a squirrel on coffee
[0:56:06] cashthb: maybe you should play disc to find it out
[0:56:36] Sunabubus: poor warrior
[0:56:59] RavenCell: i'm so damn bad at PvP
[0:57:11] Sunabubus: I wonder if anyone ever casts cyclone :)
[0:57:26] wolfcloudchaser80: Yeah, I was mega-healing myself through two dungeons because I didn't notice mouseover cast wasn't activated on this alt I was playing
[0:57:28] anker_jym: I thought I would contribute to the conversation: Cyclone
[0:57:39] averageteacup: I miss the game, watching this does not help .. i'll go back soon
[0:57:43] cloudrae: Yo that cat is just CHILLIN lol

[1:04:21] seamuscg: how much longer do wehave to get the moonbeast
[1:04:21] Ujai321: they are not the sharpest tools in the shed

[1:05:09] Ujai321: that is an early pi
[1:05:13] Sunabubus: that was a waste
[1:05:42] anker_jym: Okay, I legit have NEVER gotten this map in PvP. Didn't know it existed
[1:06:36] Aseopp: All right pvp time!
[1:07:26] Sunabubus: interesting that priests are void shifting. and they are getting away with it
[1:07:27] ix_archaix: I've been told that I need to forsake my mouseover heals and opt for macros with party 1,2,3 etc.. Is it worth steering away from clique?
[1:08:20] Ujai321: "that's me, being eaten by raptors"

[1:16:46] Sunabubus: hunters seem squishy
[1:17:52] HolocronCoder: The slight adrenaline reaction I get from that one sound notification of yours that sounds like the first half-second of a minecraft creeper igniting.
[1:18:22] Aseopp: I am going to miss hanging out here when i return to the working world. Much appreciation Hazel and friends.
[1:18:46] cashthb: if you win you get the thingy out of the caches, no need for superbloom - maybe just the flight stones
[1:18:46] Ereg45: Have you seen the vicious moonbbeast today?

[1:28:23] Sunabubus: rogue has somne brainz!
[1:29:10] archermoo: I don't know why, but the green wig looks much more like a wig than the pink one did.
[1:29:14] Sunabubus: shaman is soon oom :)
[1:29:40] samxox: Do you enjoy the tree bros as resto ?
[1:29:49] archermoo: Prolly also because you have recently had pink hair. :)
[1:30:30] wolfcloudchaser80: I don't know about PvP, but they're definitely nice in PvE healing

[1:40:57] Kaseyfullofjoy: What mount % are ya?
[1:41:02] senzu__bean: Hello all. Can anyone confirm the item level loot of follower dungeons? Is it 421 or 424 maybe?
[1:41:08] cashthb: what about my dignity?
[1:41:10] zantos2020: oh sweet, maybe I'll try that, I usually stay away from rated pvp
[1:41:56] PrChewii: Heyo Hazel, love your content, I recently saw your video on Proffesions and gold making, can I ask you a question about WeakAuras?
[1:42:36] anker_jym: Got any good doughnut places up there, Hazel?

[1:44:06] amaya21: how's the weather? is it windy?
[1:44:08] sanguinette: I think Tama is redoing the addon, I wasn't able to download it
[1:44:27] PrChewii: A big thanks from Chile VoHiYo
[1:45:09] amaya21: Just downloaded it today
[1:45:19] amaya21: worked for me
[1:45:24] baroner25: you donut situation is like my cheese steak one. its hard to find a good one unless I do it myself
[1:46:37] wolfcloudchaser80: Apparently, one of those coastal roads in Victoria has a mineral named after it. Dallasite is named for Dallas Road.
[1:47:19] anker_jym: We actually had a local gourmet doughnut shop cater our wedding instead of doing traditional cake. Between the doughnuts and the mac and cheese bar, it was very untraditional wedding food lol
[1:47:38] wolfcloudchaser80: If I'm ever visiting the island, I'm definitely going rockhounding for dallasite. It's got a neat look.
[1:48:20] anker_jym: It was fantastic lol
[1:48:27] samxox: donuts > traditions
[1:48:50] wolfcloudchaser80: Well, donuts are wedding ring shaped, after all.
[1:50:44] GreenArrowed: yesss more poolish breads
[1:51:03] diyreality: do you get more % for the mount if you win 6/6 compard to 3/6?
[1:51:22] erinnightz: my mom made some freash egg bread a couple days ago in the bread maker it was so good
[1:51:25] baroner25: Now your making me crave a everthing bagel with all this bread talk and also love sour dough so yummy with soup
[1:51:39] tonibeeswax: is this pvp?
[1:51:52] GreenArrowed: yes
[1:51:55] anker_jym: My wife made potato bread last week, it was gone in a day lol
[1:52:42] tonibeeswax: Where'd you get your glasses?? They're purty
[1:53:51] ghostie1995: oh I like warby Parker I had a pair but I broke them because they were so delicate lol
[1:53:55] tonibeeswax: my downfall is laying down with glasses on
[1:53:58] tonibeeswax: I can't not do it
[1:54:16] baroner25: oh thx for reminding me about that
[1:54:35] GreenArrowed: i had to buy one of those glasses chains so i would stop losing my glasses in public places
[1:54:35] anker_jym: Do you have contacts? I can't fathom the idea of putting something on my eyes and touching them directly
[1:55:39] Sunabubus: ouch they are hitting that poor drake pretty bad
[1:57:00] anker_jym: Well, the glasses suit you!
[1:57:15] marbared: ya, I swim and not having contacts (I don't) makes for a blurry session.
[1:57:23] wolfcloudchaser80: Yeah, it's important to see cars when running, but you also need to see crows and ravens!
[1:57:27] kynlaeh: did you still want to put the sub goal on the screen or later
[1:57:56] Sunabubus: superbloom!
[1:58:20] ExArthor: lol
[1:58:27] diyreality: what a uhm cute dream
[2:00:42] Sunabubus: last evening I got the Bakar companion from hunts after 3 repeat ohuna companion. Never have to do hunt ever again!
[2:01:14] Sunabubus: why you can even get repeats of a 1/1 uncageable pet is beyond me
[2:01:22] marbared: I'm a mount collector and I just collected enough tokens to buy the rotten apple for the Naxx mount
[2:01:46] marbared: (speaking of WoW secret hunts)
[2:01:48] tonibeeswax: There's a HazelNutty voice pack addon?? haha that's awesome
[2:01:48] Sunabubus: cant buy, its drop. lucky!
[2:01:52] Se7enthSinn: Got my Lego Axe, it's so OP!
[2:02:26] brazkat: i farm 2 tier sets a week per class got almost every class tier from vanilla-BC complete now
[2:03:02] Sunabubus: thats a dedication i will never have. props to anyone who can do this
[2:03:05] diyreality: were the grand hunt pets always available from the start or they added them recently?
[2:03:38] wolfcloudchaser80: If I heard my own voice talking to me while raiding, I think I'd think it was a bit cursed, too.
[2:04:39] Sunabubus: I stopped raiding seriously in warlords, but I kinda remember the dbm voice basically narrating the fights. Doing lfr now and it's kinda not narrating that much anymore? Maybe missing some settings
[2:04:48] kaeleirra: Your wigs are cute
[2:04:52] wolfcloudchaser80: Did you say once that you used a different pitch/quality in your voice way back when?
[2:06:30] Sunabubus: yeah but ifI remember correctly it would say "adds are coming" before the boss would spawn adds. now I have to watch the timeline
[2:06:58] wolfcloudchaser80: I do a fairly good male gnome voice, just for fun. I can't NOT say "Inventory is full!" without imitating my gnome mage.
[2:08:08] wolfcloudchaser80: I hear it a lot, yes. I may or may not be a digital hoarder.
[2:08:34] Zuldak: i just noticed i have almost 1M channel points
[2:08:56] Zuldak: Raz is gonna be rough to re-learn
[2:09:20] cashthb: have you tought about onios? like, why do we love their taste, most vegetation we like evolved to lure fauna to eat it, but what eats onions besides us?
[2:09:51] Sunabubus: ye but hitting the spawning mobs gives dewdrop. those are scarce :/
[2:09:55] Zuldak: Last night i saw a documentary on the history of garlic
[2:09:56] wolfcloudchaser80: Hint:  you can water flowers and pick  up little moonkin as other classes as long as you're hovering off the ground on a normal mount.
[2:10:20] anker_jym: Holes. That's a movie I forgot existed!
[2:10:27] ghostie1995: where is garlic from?
[2:10:34] Zuldak: apparently garlic has been with mankind since 10,000 bc and there are ancient egyptian recipes with garlic mentioned
[2:10:39] cashthb: pvp weekly quests?
[2:10:48] PressAToCraft: i head somewhere that onions were used to preserve other foods, and we kind of just got used to their flavor
[2:11:09] wolfcloudchaser80: Most of the garlic grown in the US is from one town. Gilroy, California.
[2:11:15] cashthb: inb4 epic-bg-zel
[2:11:16] Sunabubus: also deters vampires... :)
[2:11:18] Zuldak: Onions have natural acids and do preserve food yes
[2:11:30] GreenArrowed: i'm the weirdo who loves raw red onions
[2:11:31] WhippWhapp: red onions are the ones to eat raw, white and yellow are for cooking
[2:11:43] ghostie1995: carmalized onion hazelLove
[2:11:46] TheRealHanzan: is the drops not live?
[2:11:50] Zurestel77: I had an ex who used to eat an entire raw onion like an apple with a block of cheese
[2:11:52] Zurestel77: horrific
[2:11:59] Zuldak: have you ever made roasted garlic in the oven?
[2:12:00] TheRealHanzan: oh righty, thanks
[2:12:01] ghostie1995: I love red onion. especially in a sandwich
[2:12:03] Sunabubus: red onions are so good in salads
[2:12:22] bustykrabb: @Zurestel77 must be the reason they're an ex!
[2:12:23] archermoo: I love onions, but I can't eat them unless they're very well cooked. At least not without getting sick. I use a lot of onion powder.
[2:12:24] Zuldak: @Zurestel77 yeah thats real psychopath vibes there
[2:12:33] ghostie1995: that’s fair
[2:12:51] cashthb: you take onions out of a whopper?
[2:12:55] Bradic_Lamore: hey hazelllllllllll good to see you again!
[2:13:05] Bradic_Lamore: i stg i had followe dyou before
[2:13:09] wolfcloudchaser80: I like raw onion in pico de gallo or other salsas, but generally nowhere else.
[2:13:13] Bradic_Lamore: idk why it unfollowed
[2:13:16] Zuldak: in the philippines last year their onion crops failed due to typhoons and the price of onions was 10 bucks a pound. People were smuggling in onions to sell on the black market
[2:13:20] Zurestel77: @Zuldak oh yeah xD
[2:13:28] cashthb: have you tried onion jam? it's amazing in burgers
[2:13:36] cashthb: dunno bout the vegan ones tho
[2:13:40] Zuldak: Onion soup is also really goof
[2:13:42] Zuldak: good*
[2:13:54] GreenArrowed: mmmm love tomato jam
[2:14:04] WhippWhapp: raw red onion marinaded with balsamic vinegar, tomato, garlic, basil, salt & pepper with olive oil is sooooo good
[2:14:05] Bradic_Lamore: thats so random hah
[2:14:17] GreenArrowed: bcs there's toasty bread and cheese on top
[2:14:26] cashthb: there was always onion at home I guess
[2:14:30] marbared: isn't tomato jam just unblended catchup?
[2:14:55] Zuldak: well if you're pinching pennies onion soup is about as cheap as you can get next to raman
[2:15:02] cashthb: I hate it too, most cream soups are pretty lame
[2:15:04] anker_jym: What about French Onion soup?
[2:15:05] Sunabubus: I wish cooking was a recreational thing not a stay alive thing. I hate to cook on a day to day basis but ever so often I find the inspiration to just make something that is delicious :D
[2:15:30] feelsincrediblysadman: have to have rice pudding with jelly/jam
[2:15:46] sirbulljoe: I hate my cooking. Its either the most perfect miracle tasting awesome.
[2:15:53] sirbulljoe: Or its absolute trash i never know
[2:16:02] Zuldak: my sister went through a phase of making her own salad dressings
[2:16:27] cashthb: @sirbulljoe as long as it remains edible you're doing better than me
[2:16:33] Bradic_Lamore: @HazelNuttyGames cook book when!? haha
[2:16:38] ghostie1995: for being Mexican I underestimate my seasoning
[2:16:44] sirbulljoe: My cooking is RNG cooking. is eiher perfectly made or on lieral worst scale burntt or dry
[2:18:01] GreenArrowed: yes
[2:18:04] GreenArrowed: flightstones
[2:18:35] Sunabubus: some of my chars are almost flightstone capped and some barely have anouch to upgrade their gear.
[2:18:47] Sunabubus: all have the same ilevel and gear from lfr/vault/outdoor
[2:19:01] Sunabubus: *enough
[2:19:08] Bradic_Lamore: im trying to learn amge again...arcane is VASTLY different now vs the MOP days hhaha
[2:19:12] Bradic_Lamore: mage*
[2:19:39] Zuldak: i mean i am still not over the resto druid changes
[2:19:42] Bradic_Lamore: i unlocked void elves and made a spriest as well
[2:19:52] Bradic_Lamore: might unlock the big boys and do something too
[2:19:55] Bradic_Lamore: allied races are neat
[2:19:59] Sunabubus: will you stay near the minimal rating or let it climb?
[2:20:47] Zuldak: its the same with a software update. Im happy now, dont change it
[2:20:47] Bradic_Lamore: i did the raid yesterday and a frost mage wrecked the meters i was like wtf and then i saw he was like fully mythic+ geared haha
[2:20:55] Bradic_Lamore: i was still top 10 but still D
[2:21:35] Bradic_Lamore: i only JUST got enough ilvl to get in haha
[2:21:43] Sunabubus: also actiobars! Once in an expansion I finally manage to clean up my action bar, my macros, my everything on multiple chars, then they suddenly change it and i have to start from scratch
[2:22:18] Sunabubus: eypecially on hcars that go from 2x12 action bars to 2x14 or back. grrr
[2:22:22] k3lz0: Oh man, I wish my bags were THAT clean and empty...
[2:23:50] ghostie1995: but what if I need xyraths disguise when the time comes ? lol
[2:24:06] k3lz0: Exactly
[2:24:56] GreenArrowed: i never remember where sparks come from

[2:30:06] kynlaeh: well i forgot to specify 11 am- 3 pm but still such a good deal
[2:31:10] mockspiral: I think someone at blizz switched aspirant and conquest appearances by mistake, aspirant looks better for mail too
[2:32:23] CamyK22: Is that a shotgun reload sound each time a solo shuffle round starts!?!?!? lol
[2:32:30] sence_00: Have you voted on the Season 4 stuff ?
[2:33:13] cashthb: speaking of, they really should stop with the voting stuff
[2:34:00] CamyK22: I looked away for a second and thought "Hazel must have stopped stream and gave a raid to a call of duty player"
[2:34:28] Bradic_Lamore: hazel popping off haha
[2:34:50] alannatriste: We trusted the wow community in general to make good choices and then had to run Grimrail Depot for a whole season.
[2:34:57] alannatriste: I am wary at best.
[2:35:57] sence_00: ngl I liked Grimrail
[2:36:01] cashthb: well for frost mage it's pretty much  guaranteed that s3 will win, which is a shame considering that's the only 1 people actively dispise
[2:36:12] bellafoxygobble: nothing was fun about grimrail
[2:36:14] sence_00: it was short
[2:36:17] cashthb: also, who votes for s3 appearances?! just get it now!
[2:36:28] ghostie1995: the choo choo
[2:36:56] sence_00: @cashthb I think they are going to recolor them for s4 based on the way its written
[2:37:34] eielwind: i wasnt around for SL Fated, were they fully new tier sets for that?
[2:37:36] cashthb: *6 on top of 6
[2:37:55] sence_00: no not for SL I dont think
[2:37:59] cashthb: o//
[2:38:04] Bradic_Lamore: #winning lol
[2:38:19] CamyK22: Wouldnt it be 6 more colors? LFR, normal, heroic, myhtic, gladiator, and elite

[2:40:54] anduinwindrunner: is this your  new character? I remember you had a geared pvp druid last season hazelWave
[2:41:52] cashthb: @anduinwindrunner current season honor gear is better than last seasons conquest
[2:42:38] anduinwindrunner: ohhhh I see
[2:42:54] eielwind: does honor rollover? like if u are honor capped can u buy a full set next season
[2:43:01] eielwind: oop you just answered
[2:43:24] BoogiePonderosa: is honor gear comparable to raid or M+ stuff?
[2:43:35] ghostie1995: I hope they don’t reset for next season
[2:43:37] cashthb: pve gear would outpace pvp gear due to the stupid 1 billion item level tiers
[2:44:18] anduinwindrunner: I played resto druid last season for pvp but I really want to gear and push with evoker this season cuz of Nozdormu armor. It looks hella cool
[2:44:26] BoogiePonderosa: ah ok..
[2:44:41] ghostie1995: ssooo is it worth buying ?
