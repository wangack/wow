[1:47:20] PieOnRS: As a new player to WoW wanting to get into PVP, one of my biggest obstacles is having only played 1 class/spec so far. What is the "best" way for someone brand new to actually learn what each class does fundamentally in pvp?

[1:52:32] HatedHero_Uttress: the leveling process is how you learn without getting overwhelmed by 30+ icons and spells at once

[1:55:51] DondiabloSF: https://open.spotify.com/track/6r7FXNO57mlZCBY6PXcZZT
[1:55:58] PieOnRS: Oh this is super helpful
[1:56:07] PieOnRS: I haven't actually used any addons yet.
[1:56:37] Renfuryy: this is kind of the backwards way to do it, but when I started learning new classes id make characters using templates on the PTR, so theyd be fully leveled and geared, and i could just play
[1:56:52] PieOnRS: So far solo shuffle is all I can get into, because finding premades is difficult with no experience so it seems.
[1:57:00] PieOnRS: Having a lot of fun with solo shuffle though

[5:55:23] DakuiOG: fuego yap
[5:55:29] cosmin284: fuego yap
[5:55:39] DakuiOG: u need regen rune
[5:55:53] DakuiOG: and then u can literally facetank all of em
[5:56:01] Renfuryy: it doesnt have to spread, all the mobs have to be in that one spot
[5:56:03] Merixx29: target the mob behind them go in let them stack and frost nova
[5:56:07] nickas31: lol
[5:56:14] ashuraasura: you pull all the mobs then freeze them
[5:56:21] nickas31: u wna spread da fire
[5:56:27] Merixx29: so always the mobs run through the fire
[5:56:30] HatedHero_Uttress: i make a line with the Living flame and then kite them into the fire. then trap them with nova or whatever
[5:56:42] ashuraasura: then put living flame on the closest mmob to you when the freeze breaks the others will run through it
[5:56:44] crazzbez: will you be playing cata or play retail when wrath servers close
[5:56:47] DakuiOG: correct
[5:56:51] DakuiOG: u gather all of em on top
[5:56:53] Renfuryy: yes if you pull and they run at you theyll all get together
[5:56:54] DakuiOG: and facetank it
[5:56:59] DakuiOG: with regen
[5:57:12] ashuraasura: dont need to face tank just gather the mobs using ice lance
[5:57:37] HatedHero_Uttress: living flame is easier to use with the regen
[5:57:38] Renfuryy: half of these mobs are ranged so that doesnt help
[5:57:51] Angelzy99: did you enjoy dragonflight
[5:58:17] HatedHero_Uttress: put it on a mob that you arent killing first.
[5:58:23] DakuiOG: it does matter, u dont wanna put living flame on a target that is low hp cus once the target dies that uve put living flame on it fades
[5:58:36] DakuiOG: but if they are all full hp ye it doesnt matter rly
[5:58:48] crazzbez: happy to hear that, I'll be coming back for cata myself show these kids what's up
[5:59:00] Merixx29: but you only face tank "alot of mobs" when you have regen rune + arcane explosion to heal you up

[5:59:43] Legenarius: WoW Classic kinda ends at WoTLK for me Cata reminds me too  much of retail tbf
