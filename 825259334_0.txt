[0:53:49] propwash80: @Towelliee would you say that dh tank is probably the most offensive one? would you say is the tank that does the most dmg?
[0:53:57] idenkaz_: nothing new KEKW
[0:53:59] UNSUNG_HER0: @Towelliee you're finally lvling the best tank of Shadowlands....gj
[0:54:03] tawney_owl_: I changed factions but I couldnt afford a server change, so i was just stuck as the only horde on stormrage for so long
[0:54:03] HistoryMitch: What level do you unlock threads of fate?
[0:54:04] Drakenking: Subs gonna get nerfed lol
[0:54:15] specialkidmiles: rogues killing people in one global

[0:54:23] nwat1234: UNholy DK is broken af
[0:54:27] Drakenking: at least as outlaw it takes me like 4-5 globals to kill someone
[0:54:30] Ekvision: rogues have always been op in pvp
[0:54:37] propwash80: @Towelliee do you lvl through the story or through the fates of path thing?
[0:54:45] windexx21: Hey Towelliee

[0:57:18] YoHizen: @towelliee what covenant are you?
[0:57:40] tawney_owl_: dh are sick tanks, theyre just not the most fun to play which is unfortunate
[0:57:43] UNSUNG_HER0: DH tanks are the ones that groups prefer the most for M+ 17s
[0:58:08] nubsauce13: anyone know where to get that weak aura that Towelliee has on the top?
[0:58:12] Drakenking: Right because their damage is fucking insane right now
[0:58:13] giftgreen247: tank# ?
[0:58:27] wednesjae: What's your fav thing about the expansion so far?
[0:58:33] Ekvision: look at him hop around like a bunny on xtc
[0:58:34] Drakenking: Unbound chaos and immo aura are their top damage isnt it

[0:59:57] Mounolatris: are prot pallys making the haste legendary?
[1:00:00] northcub: how come you never stream anymore?
[1:00:03] tawney_owl_: @PraemusTV They got mad survival and versatility, and they look cool, its just all their damage feels like its coming from a disembodied source, and the buttons are a little simple, so its really cool but i find it frustratingly clunky
[1:00:17] rainydrainy: @Towelliee Im leveling my druid as a healer in dungeons but do you think It would be faster to do bear?

[1:01:55] SpoofAvatar: subgoals were unattainable. should have had something at 5 and 10k :P
[1:01:58] kbeltz85: not anymore, just heirlooms that give your rested xp a bit more value
[1:02:03] propwash80: @Towelliee are you running mythics or heroic?

[1:03:55] thebakeriscomingforu: @giftgreen247 the heirlooms items don't give the bonus exp anymore. There is till the potion "Draught of the ten lands" that can give you a bonus for 1 hour

[1:06:24] Luckadoo: if you level to 60 on one faction can you do threads on the opposite?
[1:06:27] The_Polish_Fish: just pvp to 171 gear then do mythics
[1:06:28] hunt_sc: @towelliee biggest issue I’m hitting is PUG heroics people dipping when they don’t get the legendary power they need.
[1:06:29] northcub: what are you grouping for?
[1:06:35] Souzen300: I've gotten into some M0s as a 160ilvl brewmaster

[1:19:58] FAN_FROM_TIKTOK: ITs only 6-7 hrs a day

[1:20:46] Crowzcut: method stream done well
[1:20:51] Yanzoh: I don't take OTK as a serious org, I just can't w all the clowns on there
[1:20:55] DallTV_: xD
[1:21:02] xartemisfowl: he can say what he wants and is entitled to his own opinion. Offended much? nymnKek @magemyway
[1:21:04] Thadune: @Towelliee Limit did the same thing.. they used to run through Redbull and Max.. now they run through their own channel. Which is much better.
[1:21:12] mlevenson88: I thought that was weird too even as a big fan of theirs
[1:21:18] generalmarcus35: Truth Hammer!!
[1:21:27] chopsaki: ppl gonna watch Max cause he's shotcalling.. that's more interesting
[1:21:28] xzezama: What even is OTK? Feel pog for not knowing
[1:21:29] MrKhanes: yeah they havent used that channel at all so far for ther events, i dont get it. The events have been good so far, but i dont get why they are not using there own org channel.
[1:21:37] Zephon302: hi
[1:21:38] Kerrax_: Which convenant did you pick for your Pally?

[1:22:03] Rivanozz: because Max channel has comms. Limit channel dont
[1:22:04] Spaede: I wish there was a way to get Picture in Picture going. If complexity could get that and have “simulcam” for 4 or 5 POVs that’s would be sick
[1:22:08] callum_bm: OTK got a couple people on there with most young audience, not for me tbh
[1:22:13] Cooby4Z: so i look at OTK like i do tv shows, you have your serious dramas, and your comedies, im sure you can figure out which they are.
[1:22:22] swampt1l: You made me play brew and ive been enjoying towHAMUP towHAMUP @Towelliee
[1:22:23] idenkaz_: Imagine saying OTK exists just so Asmon can make more money. Who the fuck says that.

[1:36:20] Drakenking: Idk Max was saying Echo is basically method but with a better roster so well see
[1:36:25] svenskavelli: echo
[1:36:34] Zonoxx_tv: Also just based on the assumption that it will be a short tier
[1:36:34] Cjstyling: Echo is a nutty team
[1:36:43] teibner94: Think Sire will have a mythic only phase?
[1:36:43] HaxzorJimDuggan: you ready to shave your head again

[1:37:20] Crowzcut: no
[1:37:22] WoundedWarriorProject: @Naturalbeef Thank you for that! We appreciate the support!
[1:37:28] Atokiri: Towellie and day off only means one thing, Las Vegas. LULW
[1:37:28] Billo0w: that only was after the wfr started
[1:37:32] Kromede: towDynt
[1:37:34] Clay2K_: Did method break up or something?
[1:37:35] Timeler: multi dollar companyyyyyy
[1:37:38] Cjstyling: sco is a good player but he was one of the weaker players on method
[1:37:39] Crowzcut: sco his legend in wow
[1:37:40] kngkoopa: im sure its nice to have tho
[1:37:47] Fruicer: it'd be nice tho
[1:37:53] Sincline387: This world first is odd because we don't have the mass gatherings of the top guilds. So the million dollar backing is less important.
[1:37:55] Drakenking: Sco may be a legend but it doesnt mean there arent better tanks right now
[1:38:00] cowee12356995: @woundedwarriorproject guzuOkay my favorite hat is from you folks! guzuL love the work you do

[1:38:22] Drakenking: Max has said it but Sco has inhibted progress and benched himself in the past and was planning on not playing for method for this tier
[1:38:28] dragoncook: i went through 8 people in one Necrotic Wake cause of people just looting the 2 shards for the mount
[1:38:31] Crowzcut: sco made world 1st was not for method will not be world 1st
[1:38:35] Drakenking: before all the big situations happened
[1:38:43] WoundedWarriorProject: @cowee12356995 That's awesome to hear! We appreciate the kind words.
[1:38:59] Urebaldd: Yeah it's much better this time around
[1:39:06] Drakenking: That doesnt matter at all Crowz, he would simply move to a coaching position, you have to realize when youre holding your team back
[1:39:07] qualybased: Whys that?
[1:39:08] mabrno: WoD was pretty chill aswell
[1:39:13] Urebaldd: Bfa was a second job sometimes
[1:39:14] Cjstyling: no bull shit AP grind
[1:39:18] WoundedWarriorProject: @Towelliee We are really thinking about picking up WOW and playing with our Wounded Warriors, Which class should we play in Shadowlands?
[1:39:23] idenkaz_: @CrowzCut what KEKW
[1:39:28] Sersani: and that's awesome

[1:39:42] Crowzcut: thats max i know sco very well i love down road by him
[1:39:48] Cjstyling: @WoundedWarriorProject WARRIOR
[1:39:53] tavza: just because its relaxing for normal players, doesnt mean thats its a full time job for professionals, look at echo leveling 9 characters and running mythic with all of them
[1:39:53] Crowzcut: live
[1:40:12] Aladdor: Veng DH for the win!
[1:40:19] WoundedWarriorProject: @MrGrimripper @Elitecjs425 2 votes Warriors
[1:40:33] WoundedWarriorProject: We heard melee is really good this expansion :-)

[1:41:43] Biorrwolf: @towelliee What's your opinion on the Hardcore WoW community?
[1:41:47] kbeltz85: Elemental is doing well
[1:41:51] hunterxp: Rsham for heals are pretty insane right now
[1:41:57] SensationalBanana: Wait, Naxx came out? Literally not heard anything about it...
[1:41:59] kbeltz85: Shaman in general are in a good place right now
[1:42:03] Ramstein: Enhancement or Resto
[1:42:09] darkrelams: @towelliee ret pally ale lowkey broken
[1:42:09] tacofury2: enhance is also really fun to play
[1:42:09] jubee240: he just dont like rogue that's why he giving no credit.

[1:42:31] Anubys83: i just switched to elemental last night still leveling but elemental feels better to me
[1:42:31] Affiiance: Windwalker is actually strong af right now too
[1:42:32] Nylzyo: What they gonna nerf bout that leggo?
[1:42:44] spiritXC: i hope warlock will be ok for m+
[1:42:46] Nylzyo: They cant without makin it useless^^
[1:42:52] WoundedWarriorProject: It sounds like every class has something to offer, but warrior really sticks out to us
[1:42:55] xzezama: HAVOC BUFF!!
[1:42:56] OlHotrodEvans: I hope they dont nerf the holy pal shield leggo
[1:42:57] Wulfenst: @Towelliee think they nerf MM hunter? even though our dmg is very front loaded from cooldowns
[1:43:00] splic3r0: I'm playing 3 classes right now, I'm waiting to see who gets nerfed the most to drop, I can't keep up with 3. lol. single dad/own a business
[1:43:07] Mellamojay: you think they will nerf boomkin?
[1:43:08] Cyntec: Havoc DH is feeling pretty good this Xpac aswell in M +
[1:43:10] maalow: And they'll be useless for the rest of the expac sadly
[1:43:11] JonnyHexx: Destruction Warlocks are gunna be really really good for M+
[1:43:12] CreepyCow: Need Havoc buffs plz
[1:43:17] Vigi9413: the shaman in group is ele
[1:43:21] jerexify: Blech.
[1:43:26] Affiiance: Im already sick of the fucking Mawe
[1:43:29] Highmen3: I usually skip maw content, it bothers me so much
[1:43:31] windexx21: why?
[1:43:32] ImHellaSad: i think i refuse to do maw content
[1:43:37] Urebaldd: Half the time the callings give trash with high sell value, it's weird man
[1:43:41] kngkoopa: i love torgahs, the rest of the maw is just a headache
[1:43:43] Luckadoo: do we have to do maw content? shit is gross
[1:43:43] Strouss: i actually dont mind the maw, but i am a druid so taht helps alot
[1:43:54] CardinalTX: Instead of the Maw cant I just punch myself in the dick 10 times and get what i need?
[1:43:57] MrGattz: for sure
[1:43:58] Mythaphorical: Can you repeat that tally....i missed it. What are we to do daily? Just to make sure im doing things right since i not a pro player
[1:43:58] Innex: @Towelliee Which daily grind is most important right now for someone who will be a semi casual player?
[1:44:02] Deathkanigit101: Havoc is fine you all just don't know how to play ;P
[1:44:04] ImHellaSad: i dont really wanna do torghast either
[1:44:04] OlHotrodEvans: worgen and druids are probably okay with it
[1:44:05] The_Tyrannical_Talkboxx: Whatcha mean the maw is great
[1:44:10] MOLAR305: someone got the mount for the maw already
[1:44:12] tumb_tack: get gud scrubs
[1:44:12] The_Tyrannical_Talkboxx: especially on my druid
[1:44:21] Innex: Should I be focusing on maw, covenant, or gear grinding?
[1:44:25] cevyr1: I only do the maw so far as it is slightly required for Campagin progress
[1:44:25] SorionTheGinger: @Towelliee i'm gonna be happy once they either disable elite quests - or enable the proper use of the group finder again .....
[1:44:28] Aaradin: someone in the wowhead discord said they got the maw mount yesterday and posted a picture, but not sure if they were trolling
[1:44:28] papapuggly: im new here hello
[1:44:31] Ramstein: @innex probably maw stuff
[1:44:32] JonnyHexx: also im crushin on Arms Warriors rn
[1:44:37] cevyr1: LIke in, do my dailies, out
[1:44:40] PokerFaceMoose: @WoundedWarriorProject think of it like this, the warrior class is one of the few that exists in a world full of magic and has to overcome it with strength, skill, and their own intelligence.
[1:44:41] Pharaoh_326: did someone win the laptop @Towelliee ?
[1:44:43] AbigailDMG: As someone who hasn't played WoW since Lich King, this expansion looks fun
[1:44:50] Affiiance: Yeah its like ok we experimented with the no mount thing, and to no ones surprise it fucking sucks
[1:44:51] Czyszn: how can someone get the mount so fast?
[1:44:56] Domiku: funny I think the Maw is exciting yet Torghasr very boring
[1:44:57] kbeltz85: @innex do your callings and renown quests, then gear up, maw can wait if you dont want it. But do Torghast for sure
[1:44:57] Eternaalll: i failed my soul ash mission :(
[1:44:59] ninedraft317: same
[1:45:10] westelan_: new 240hr stream?? :p
[1:45:13] Gypsiboyy: just started myt first mission for soul ash last night will see how it goes
[1:45:22] WoundedWarriorProject: @PokerFaceMoose That is some great insight! Love it. Do we go Arms or Fury though?
[1:45:27] PAPAHEXtech: How far into the story till the mission table unlocks?
[1:45:30] Czyszn: i love torghast but the balance is wonkly. all floors get destoryed but the bosses are super hard
[1:45:41] hunterxp: @WoundedWarriorProject arms is meta atm
[1:45:43] Eternaalll: would love to but EU :(
[1:45:47] BaldnBlazed: Arms is stronger right now i think right?
[1:45:49] aspiration89: @WoundedWarriorProject Arms is better right now.
[1:45:50] Cjstyling: damn i dont get how people think torghast is boring
[1:45:51] NightofStarrs: Just got a level 60 druid... but it's Alliance and you only run Horde.
[1:45:51] Gypsiboyy: @Towelliee im 183 restoo druid will help u in heroic homie
[1:45:52] Psussenes: Which mouse do you use @Towelliee
[1:46:02] MrJ195: gzgzgzgz
[1:46:05] kbeltz85: Arms is usually stronger early in the expansion, fury's scaling will shine in 2nd or 3rd patch

[1:54:24] SpoofAvatar: classic was a joke

[1:54:25] ForgetfulOkami: pretty much
[1:54:26] darkrelams: @towelliee what u feel about pally ?
[1:54:30] splic3r0: barkskin leggo is from huntsmen
[1:54:34] Aquadriel: classic is dead 🦀
[1:54:37] Zastrow_DM: @Towelliee it does not work on gunnar-optiks dot eu, just tried it man
[1:54:37] Muaytitus: blizz did classic dirty in the end
[1:54:42] ForgetfulOkami: so much nostalgia over classic
[1:54:43] Cal_Kat: Good morning :), sure been asked this before but curious how would rank tanks far as dmg done? I am trying decide on tank and so torn
[1:54:52] raldrik: Olympus couldnt get a full raid together
[1:55:04] quakegoogl: i just got whole bag of food from the shop/ it cant be 2 hours already
[1:55:04] shkurrt: they wanna kill classic lulw
[1:55:07] Strouss: Legacy of the sleeper is really good for raid too
[1:55:13] quakegoogl: 155 for me
[1:55:20] KingSlayerYotam: maybe they wanted to get rid of it for tbc
[1:55:25] Wheeellz: i honestly think blizz just wants classic to be done
[1:55:26] HaxzorJimDuggan: if shadowlands didnt get delayed it wouldnt have been that bad
[1:55:27] Muaytitus: SL killed classic
[1:55:33] ZeethianDragon: I think blizz is just sick of classic
[1:55:35] OopsRyBad: cuz ppl are playing slands
[1:55:36] Muaytitus: most guilds couldnt do naxx cause people left for sl
[1:55:39] Drostep: Poor Naxx got shit on twice LUL
[1:55:42] HaxzorJimDuggan: but i guess they wanted to keep classic on the same schedule because of TBC
[1:55:56] aspiration89: Paladinie is the GM for olympus anyway. Asmon is the self proclaimed "mascot" for that guild now lol
[1:56:11] Aquadriel: then it wasnt a mistake from blizz, that is the true classic experience Kappa
[1:56:13] Drostep: Esfand said the bosses where easy LUL
[1:56:14] noteworthynerd: Truth. That's exactly what happened to my Vanilla guild.
[1:56:15] talic420: ya in about 6th months they will do BC then later WoLK
[1:56:30] LoseAlotLuke: people die on first boss, lose all their world buffs then leave group and give up
[1:56:32] Aquadriel: Drostep if esfand said that, they must be REALLY EASY then LUL
[1:56:33] Drostep: Yeah I skipped naxx because of TBC
[1:56:40] Galadeon: Didn't that happen with Sunwell also? It ddn't come out until after WotLK was announced?
[1:56:43] Drostep: LUL
[1:56:51] Throdio: I don't think they ever really cared for Classic. Guilds may of had more raiders for it, and there may of been more community hype, but it all would of died quick either way.
[1:56:57] Drostep: They where one shotting bosses
[1:57:03] raldrik: Yeah it was because people were doing other things. It makes sense Asmon ditched them at Loatheb.

[1:57:27] meijd: @towelliee how are you liking the DH?
[1:57:32] LoseAlotLuke: gz stallowned
[1:57:41] Aaradin: we cleared the 7 bosses but have to go back and finish it just because naxx has so many bosses
[1:57:43] Stormin27: 26

[1:59:08] talic420: classic players are keeping blizzards income going.
[1:59:13] WoundedWarriorProject: What is the fastest way to level up in shadowlands? A mix of Questing and dungeons?
[1:59:36] tawney_owl_: @WoundedWarriorProject Threads of fate will be best, but if youre a tank throw dungeons in there too
[1:59:49] quakegoogl: ruyuF karlga1Cutlass
[2:00:02] ZeethianDragon: It's amazing how people screw up the hook here
[2:00:14] WoundedWarriorProject: @tawney_owl_ We will have to keep that in mind :-)
[2:00:16] Hidden_Citizen: When do the vaults unlock?
[2:00:58] TheNodbot: Do the campaign then flip to ToF right before dinging 60
[2:01:00] ForgetfulOkami: you can swap covenants
[2:01:02] Strouss: next week, tech 2 weeks
[2:01:05] Slydaer: which is faster do you think to get to 60
[2:01:07] Baladore: Too far away
[2:01:07] tawney_owl_: Oh yeah if its your first time then do the campagn, threads of fate is for alts
[2:01:07] Jram269: storyline to 59 then threads of fate
[2:01:16] WoundedWarriorProject: We will keep that in mind thanks for all the pointers! :-)
[2:01:22] mab_music_ttrpg: a lot of popping this morning on the microphone
[2:01:26] DreadPirateSavage: or do the campaign again if thats what you like
[2:01:32] xzezama: @Towelliee Easiest Mythic Dungeons to do?
[2:01:36] Strouss: yeah dont do ToF right away i think it sucks lol
[2:01:54] shagbark_: can't believe the Thon is already over, where did those 10 days go?
[2:02:07] Gypsiboyy: Halls of Stone?
[2:02:13] Jram269: if you want to get your alt to 60 as fast as possible you do the storyline and then switch to threads before 60
[2:02:15] iDazidan: ToF is okay if you have a group you can do dungeons and bonus objectives with
[2:02:15] noxitall: its wotlk again bois

[3:11:09] Djulio: blizzard really needs to put legendaries at the last boss of the dungeons, people are just leaving after not getting their legendary effect...
[3:11:21] Vigi9413: as someone who works night shift 8pm-8am i've grown to hate breakfast

[3:14:06] DrakhanGaming: how does bacon in the oven not cause a fire
[3:14:10] adambraz123: halls is my favourite dungeon
[3:14:12] Gothbrud: @crescens22 VH DH so you can be dps and tank at the same time ;)
[3:14:15] DrakhanGaming: or tons of grease to splatter all over the oven
[3:14:42] mgweirdo: @DrakhanGaming it doesn't spatter, it just drains into the pan
[3:14:43] shagbark_: save a gargoyle for the boss!
[3:14:43] HaloS23: @Towelliee are the GFUEL cans carbonated??
[3:15:05] mgweirdo: @DrakhanGaming usually parchment paper or metal rack on a cookie sheet, the sheet catches everything
[3:15:27] ThatW0lF: big boy pulls
[3:15:43] HaloS23: interesting
[3:15:59] SaoooH: all 0? just drink water then kekw
[3:16:18] Molvonos: @SaoooH Water doesnt have any flavor.
[3:16:34] HaloS23: @Towelliee no not carbs. are the cans fizzy like soda i mean
[3:16:39] SaoooH: if u imagine it will
[3:16:45] Tzarvahl: a little bit of carb isnt too bad, keeps you from gettin the squirts lol. source is friend on zero carb keto, apparently its a thing lmao
[3:16:46] DrakhanGaming: he said they had carbonated water
[3:16:52] Czyszn: whats fastest way from 1 to 50?
[3:17:02] ThatW0lF: <3
[3:17:03] Bedpan_BoB: @TheStankyBeard I like the squirts
[3:17:12] HaloS23: yeah just pointing out that not the same thing
[3:17:22] CozzyFlannel: @Czyszn WoD. Use azeroth auto pilot
[3:17:27] Frogbasher: @Czyszn 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8....
[3:17:30] Alienfromger: towQueen
[3:17:31] SaoooH: makes sense haha
[3:17:35] sozaldz: if it uses xylulose as a sweetner in the US because it is small but not 0 carbs they make the serving size just at the number where they can legally round down to zero. So depends
[3:17:36] oggokogok: @Czyszn strictly fastest is buying a boost, but I'd imagine what's fastest would depend on the spec you're interested in. Tanks and healers tend to be faster doing dungeon spam
[3:17:42] silverknight16: My favorite part was where she Team Rockets herself into the sky.
[3:17:58] Czyszn: @CozzyFlannel whats azeroth auto pilot?
[3:18:05] Czyszn: im thinking of making a pally or a war
[3:18:09] whatsupkg: vengeance looks pretty solid @Towelliee
[3:18:27] FlySkeez: would you say tanks the best way to play if you like running in and doiing decent to good dmg?
[3:18:37] silverknight16: so is Spirit Bomb the meta this time around?
[3:18:39] FlySkeez: cause id like to be tanky but i also like being op
[3:18:46] DrakhanGaming: isnt spirit bomb the thing goku did
[3:18:47] NexLap: my spirit bomb doesn't feel that strong at all
[3:18:51] CozzyFlannel: @Czyszn its an AddOn. Download CurseForge and search Azeroth Auto Pilot. It routes the fastest leveling path for you and skips cutscene/dialogue.
[3:19:06] Kromede: towDynt

[3:19:13] Czyszn: :O wow thx @CozzyFlannel
[3:19:16] PraemusTV: Blood DK? @iiotta for me, the more enemies I have on me the more sustain i have & decent ae dmg
[3:19:42] Kromede: KEKW
[3:19:43] bigrogue_35: famous last words. "lets get stupid"
[3:19:51] bigrogue_35: lol
[3:20:07] Vexnya: @iiotta i mean, if you want tanky then yeah by definition tanks are it, not to mention demon hunters in dungeons can actually pull close to the dps in raw numbers on trash
[3:20:07] ThatW0lF: You got this. biggest boy pull
[3:20:14] itscityboy: priest ftw
[3:20:17] CozzyFlannel: that poor healer
[3:20:18] Vexnya: if not more
[3:20:20] gidgeet: Is it me or does BM hunter feel a little weak? I have issues with Torghast on some bosses.
[3:20:21] imofp: @Towelliee can you bump up in game volume or nah?
[3:20:23] NerdDEX: not playing pally?
[3:20:31] quakegoogl: grubORC ruyuF ruyuF
[3:20:45] Endin: @Towelliee got my lasik surgery yesterday, if yours still holding up well?
[3:20:48] CardinalTX: OP!
[3:20:51] Holysal: @nerddex he is just playing an alt
[3:20:51] NerdDEX: can't tell with all the mobs on his head
[3:20:52] stereo_type: @gidgeet bm hunter is stupid op.
[3:20:57] Vexnya: @gidgeet depends on the boss, it can be rough for all dps, especially casters
[3:21:12] CozzyFlannel: are you going to level a druid tank too? @Towelliee
[3:21:12] Moobot: Towelliee is now exclusively streaming on Twitch. It has been a long road! Now we begin a new era for Towelliee Gaming. Thank you all for supporting me for the last 10 years.

[3:21:17] bigrsmith: @gidgeet I been having issues on the final boss of level 2 and 3 for the upper level
[3:21:25] gidgeet: Maybe I just need better gear;
[3:21:28] Vexnya: dps rely more on anima powers for late torghast floors and layers to not be rough
[3:21:30] DelcoAF: you hung over?
[3:21:35] bigrsmith: @gidgeet That is what I figured for myself
[3:21:45] CozzyFlannel: that healer needs a drink after that lol
[3:22:12] jason_shade: i used to tank queue in legion and just dps and roll through them, was great for augs
[3:22:17] Czyszn: you been averaging about a level every 45-50min
[3:22:39] NerdDEX: anyone know if Wars are shit tanks now?
[3:22:45] tebbix: are SL dungeons too easy or players are so good ?
[3:22:57] Czyszn: easy now harder later?
[3:23:00] Vexnya: @nerddex none of the tanks are shit
[3:23:15] DasWhip: You like trink from De Othe Side? Big Blood shield
[3:23:20] ThatW0lF: what does mastery do for vengeance DH?
[3:23:21] DasWhip: lovin iut
[3:23:24] Friisolade: @tebi1997 Once people figure out the tactics, then it's pretty easy mode, like every other expansion
[3:23:24] Vexnya: we only have access to mythic 0 dungeons at the highest, dungeons have never been hard at these difficulties
[3:23:52] Tickletrain: my guild 1 shot naxx
[3:23:59] Nerendis: They should have pushed up or delayed naxx
[3:24:07] pk99: the shroud 16 hour naxx run
[3:24:13] Rylexthegreat: I mean could you blame them? LUL
[3:24:18] Just2Nasty801: Well blizzard was stupid to release naxx right now i think
[3:24:22] Friisolade: Classic is a dying game unfortunately.
[3:24:22] Kael88: @ThatW0lF Attack power and increased armor with demon spikes
[3:24:24] DarthWrex: Towelliee, does your guild have any openings?
[3:24:29] Aaradin: we split it into 2 nights going to finish it tonight
[3:24:31] ZinZog: My guild took like 5h to clear naxx, wiped like 10times on sapphiron
[3:24:46] ThatW0lF: thanks @Kael88
[3:24:49] Aaradin: so it didnt take 4 hours
[3:24:51] NerdDEX: @darthwrex I think they are looking for a new waterboy.. :P
[3:24:56] pk99: no idea if they kill KT fell asleep lol
[3:25:01] pereadin: If you LOS the boss around the corner he doesn’t spawn more than 1 set of adds.
[3:25:05] gidgeet: @bigrsmith I bought some 151 item level gear off the AH it didn't help any lol
[3:25:07] CADZtv: shroud guild kinda struggle on loathab
[3:25:13] Nerendis: APes lost before they pulled 4 horseman

[3:25:30] Whytepap3r: That's what screwed them up
[3:25:34] AcidSyndicate: world first
[3:25:36] Utmost777: who got first?

[3:41:27] sshadeh: MM hunter is busted
[3:41:32] MrGattz: @jaycer89x really choose whatever feels fun to play. everything is very viable. i would personally suggest druid or demon hunter for tank but anything works
[3:41:34] nahweh: @jaycer89x this exp my first time tanking (off tank) i tried blood dk and prot pally. prot pally seemed way more chill and has more dmg
[3:41:47] Murlocz: wtf, 800 gold world quest reward LUL
[3:41:52] FruckAwesome: hmm cant find either guild in guild finder
[3:42:03] stitch0: They added a buff to you when you leave Ven'ari's Refuge that makes you temporarily invincible
[3:42:07] kjorikel: mm by a lot
[3:42:13] nahweh: surv is very mediocre mm is top tier on cleave
[3:42:14] MrGattz: yeah mm is a lot stronger atm
[3:42:18] Saphirosa_Dragonaspect: I still love my bm
[3:42:18] thrillersan: is bm hunter still fine?
[3:42:20] Czyszn: MM is bonkers with fae

[3:42:20] BubbaChubbs420: MM is broken
[3:42:23] sharie: Survivals problem is its meele
[3:42:23] thebakeriscomingforu: Marks or BM for hunter. Depending on content
[3:42:25] JayceR89x: Ah thanks guys. I’ll try them out :)
[3:42:26] quakegoogl: catleeCORN
[3:42:27] TheSublimeNine: hello
[3:42:28] gidgeet: @Puffkin It just really depends on if you wanna make money; Do gathering at first Herb, Mining sell on AH make gold.
[3:42:32] JrocThaGreat: Hard is on a scale, but pal is way easier than dk
[3:42:35] Galadeon: BM is not that far behind MM.
[3:42:42] gr0x3n: mm is carpal tunnel lol
[3:42:44] Lulaboo: Fuck shade, join the struggle bus
[3:42:45] PharoGames: marks is just good for the moment because of burst but once raid is out BM will end up going back on top in terms of sustain and movement heavy fights.
[3:42:46] sshadeh: i have seen MM hunters pretty much oneshot people with double tap aimed shot in 2s
[3:42:47] Glynson: Why did you change factions?
[3:42:49] UNSUNG_HER0: Shade....meh
[3:42:51] turfjitsu: lol

[3:43:49] UberManDude: @Towelliee I hate Healing DH. Every time, I see one I'm like, Here we freaking go again with the jumping and shit
[3:43:51] sharie: @JAYMURCS in the sense Meele spots are already Limited so why would you bring a Survival Hunter an dnot another DH or Warrior or Rogue
[3:44:05] Majedwk: @Towelliee Hey tow first day as a subscriber and loving it, been watching you since TGN cata, biggest love from saudi arabia
[3:44:06] Templexx: been horde on illidan since 2009. wats different just curious @Towelliee
[3:44:10] quakegoogl: towHorde towRed
[3:44:18] sshadeh: people back in day transfered to horde cause top guilds transfered to horde for racials. now even if the racials were a bit better on alliance, the community is still on horde
[3:44:28] nahweh: as a blood dk i feel like im constantly giving my healer an aneurysm by sitting on 30% hp
[3:44:35] sshadeh: and community means players for raids and dungeons
[3:44:37] Utmost777: @Towelliee doesn't look like any regions are fully shut down yet. The Gov just announced his plan to shut down based on ICU availability
[3:44:48] Doomlace: Whats the biggest difference youve seen between Horde and Alliance?
[3:44:59] Tzarvahl: i was under the impression that death jester leadership was being abusive towards people, which caused a lot of people to leave. idk for sure though, not trying to start anything
[3:45:05] CADZtv: @sharie what? survival performing better then warrior form the charts ive seen?

[3:46:43] sshadeh: @TheStankyBeard i understand that but at the same time i want to be useful to my group
[3:46:47] NerdWorf: @UberManDude i agree my poor dk and hunter cant keep up

[3:48:52] NexLap: yeah i'm 186 and it's hard to get to 2k single target
[3:48:54] Teyr3: Those assasin daggers stack the dmg quick
[3:49:01] NexLap: but i do like 5-10k on groups
[3:49:02] sshadeh: never had any problems with domina in mythic by just stacking together, opening all the webs, killing adds and avoiding assassinate
[3:49:19] Ninjasneekers: Vengeance or Brewmaster tanking for shadowlands?
[3:49:20] NexLap: castle
[3:49:20] jason_shade: raid
[3:49:22] marshmallow110: stone legion
[3:49:26] Nerendis: Castle, the stone legion boss
[3:49:28] Professor_Oddy: what level engineering do you have to be to get Battle Rez?
[3:49:28] UberManDude: @darkhmoon I do not think it helps a resto shaman because no one stays in a single place.
[3:49:29] Hitokiri83: rstone legion
[3:49:39] quakegoogl: grubL Squid1
[3:49:50] sshadeh: @UberManDude you can after you have opened the webs, we had resto shammy too
[3:49:51] NexLap: i just wish DH had a little better single target dmg
[3:50:03] UberManDude: @darkhmoon Ye, afterwards.
[3:50:09] sshadeh: and if you have ranged people, they can open the webs from distance, so it wont take long
[3:50:27] sshadeh: even some melees do, like DK death and decay
[3:50:59] pereadin: wait its not guaranteed from raid bosses?..

[3:51:04] silverknight16: It honestly seems like Blizzard just went, "FUCK BALANCE" when coming up with this expansion.
[3:51:05] treeshark: yup feels off
[3:51:06] nihilistic_bat: aye, mines not avail until raid
[3:51:09] MrGattz: me to. why the hell did blizzard make legos drop from the first boss of dungeons... what dumb ass thought that was a good idea. now we just have tanks and healers leaving after one boss kill cause they didnt get what they wanted.
[3:51:11] fewyn: yep feels off imo
[3:51:11] Caaethil: I think the drop rate will be high or 100% on raid bosses, don't quote me
[3:51:12] roflpotamus: Should have only been dungeons/wq
[3:51:13] aspiration89: Probably because blizzard doesn't consider one "bis"
[3:51:13] Mcbeave: Shouldve all been raid or all been dungeons
[3:51:14] sshadeh: i agree, some already have their BiS, i have to wait
[3:51:17] Gairfrede: Yup, Upgrading made it odd
[3:51:22] Buckwink: if it is you can just get it first week
[3:51:23] CADZtv: @sharie what utility we talking about here just straight buffs or being able to cc cause the only thing survival doesnt bring is a buff like battle shout
[3:51:23] kappaday23: Kappa

[3:51:29] Zube12: my legendary is off a world boss, so more waiting
[3:51:35] UberManDude: @Towelliee I'm not sure why they even brought leggos this early because people are doing instance in PUGS and leaving the group while the instance is not done. Pisses me off.

[3:51:45] gorilla_quantistico: its gonna be like dungos @Towelliee the higher the difficulty the higher the drop chance
[3:51:46] pereadin: I hope it is
[3:51:47] sshadeh: @ninukai which is one of the 4 weekly bosses that go in a cycle.. gotta hope its the first one
[3:51:52] Vexnya: @Zube12 on the bright side, world bosses will be 100% as far as we know
[3:52:07] JeemTeam: design is fine
[3:52:09] Czyszn: does Heroic increase drop rate? for leggo?
[3:52:13] Noshpan: 100% drop seems like wishful thinking

[3:52:35] ninukai: @darkhmoon its off Nurgash Muckformed :(
[3:52:44] sshadeh: weekly WQ bosses have 100% drop chance, how often do you get to kill a raid boss? on the release of a raid?
[3:52:46] Czyszn: i need to do plaguefall for MM lego
[3:52:50] Exodeo_: did you torture the shammy too much?;p

[3:52:55] JeemTeam: they dont need to tell you, just play the game
[3:52:56] MrRicter: i thought i read somewhere it was like an 80% drop chance
[3:53:17] mo197: woodpecker?
[3:53:23] sshadeh: i can imagine the raid drop chance being high, cause it can take a while to get all the way to the last boss which drops BiS for many classes

[4:05:17] Nazz_1138: @Towelliee finally got my kegsmash leggo, after 51 attempts lol
[4:05:25] sshadeh: i think the highest ilvl reward is based on the highest key you run, so one +15 gives one +15 loot quaranteed, rest are lower
[4:05:32] griffdog125: people not doing 14s in 184 gr llol
[4:05:32] BearOfLight: Yeah, I'd agree, running 10 M+ is one thing, but making sure you have 10 as high as possible or risk options being a non--choice because they are lower ilvl doesn't sound like a good design.
[4:05:39] Nerendis: How do you do 10 14s if there are 8 dungons
[4:05:50] Nerendis: wairt
[4:05:51] Nerendis: nvm
[4:05:54] sshadeh: @HickoryLIVE you can grind m+ LUL

[4:07:09] Buckwink: LOL
[4:07:10] Just2Nasty801: lol
[4:07:12] gorilla_quantistico: @Towelliee i dont think you can do 1 14 and spam 2s
[4:07:12] KBlast_OG: I was going to ask the same question
[4:07:13] nickyptheg: so we can spam mythic all we want
[4:07:15] SeckSymbols: Per WoWhead "If you completed more than 10 M+ dungeons in a week, on reset, you would get three items offered in your Great Vault. The first one's ilevel would be based on the highest level dungeon that you completed. The second one's ilevel would be based on the fourth highest level dungeon that you completed. The third one's ilevel would be based on the tenth highest level dungeon that you completed."
[4:07:15] nihilistic_bat: brought back up the burns :D
[4:07:18] nickyptheg: that is great news
[4:07:21] Just2Nasty801: mythic+ you cant run over and over agian
[4:07:25] kimmo_gaming: You know you dont get saved for a dungeon if you do m+ right?
[4:07:28] Buckwink: poor guy
[4:07:29] SpoofAvatar: M0 is once per week, M+ you can spam
[4:07:33] Nerendis: I'm just a DPS demon hunter, I don't user my brainnnn
[4:07:40] sshadeh: you need to run 10 any level keys for 3 rewards, "The first one's ilevel would be based on the highest level dungeon that you completed. The second one's ilevel would be based on the fourth highest level dungeon that you completed. The third one's ilevel would be based on the tenth highest level dungeon that you completed. "
[4:07:42] sshadeh: from wowhead
[4:08:10] Damuffin14: i mean do you really need 9 choices for gear thou?
[4:08:28] SpoofAvatar: you will prolly get a lower third the first week cause you have to push the key
[4:08:41] sshadeh: @Damuffin14 many will skip pvp so thats 6 choices

[4:09:36] soysos91: is m+ capped at +6 next week?
[4:09:42] r0bojesust: Did we need to do 15s or 10s on bfa launch?
[4:09:45] sshadeh: @Damuffin14 most will go for that, and to get that, in addition to raiding, you need to run atleast 10 m+ dungeons
[4:09:48] soysos91: someone told me it was
[4:10:00] nickyptheg: so if I try out M0 and I go with a fail group I am SOL for a whole week?
[4:10:16] Mazeltough: @Towelliee why double tank?
[4:10:20] Damuffin14: yah i heard should be fun
[4:10:33] r0bojesust: @nickyptheg it's boss lockout, so if it fails you can just go with another group.

[4:37:43] PharoGames: @Towelliee you also dont need to swap to threads at 59.9 anymore because the quest will still be available after you hit 60 so you can swap to skip the rest of the campaign and get the 4 zone wide campaign progress bars

[4:49:27] FennixLoL: @googsTV thank you!
[4:49:29] Innex: I can't beat him
[4:49:32] Pallyofhell: it is pretty shit compared to other healers
[4:49:33] NotDillyTV: Pure sims say HPaly is just about the worst for PvE rn
[4:49:35] Rulem: it has a strong build but does no dps
[4:49:36] diefastergaming: You pick your covenant yet?
[4:49:42] Fat_Guy_Games: Holy has less overall healing but higher average DPS
[4:49:42] ExpoUhl: Holy is usually tough for AOE healing.
[4:49:49] hunterxp: rsham disc and holy pally in that order pretty much are how good the heals are
[4:49:58] hunterxp: much of it is skill level though.
[4:50:00] SammyK_G: @Towelliee I agree, I play Holy, and group healing is rough
[4:50:08] thebakeriscomingforu: raids will probably run resto shaman, disc priest, and then resto druid or holy priest, or mistweaver, depending what is needed
[4:50:11] MasterSIoth: Holy has always been rough for group healing, glimmer was supposed to make that easier but it got nerfed when transfered from BFA to SL
[4:50:15] turfjitsu: alleged top pally in chat
[4:50:19] Coriollis: disc priest and monk op healers atm
[4:50:25] thebakeriscomingforu: or just double up on shaman and disc
[4:50:28] snoo_32: don't holy pallies have a similar mechanic as disc priest
[4:50:30] Takobaited: yeah, I'm Mr. Blizzard and bear tanking is OP
[4:50:35] Rylexthegreat: Everyone is "world top" in their class on Twitch Jebaited
[4:50:36] hunterxp: i don't use glimmer, i find virtue actually way better
[4:50:42] SammyK_G: once we get our lego, yes
[4:50:43] hunterxp: if used correctly
[4:50:55] MainlyHigh: yo inv me my warrior goremaxe
[4:50:56] Innex: If I get observer zelgar one more time in torghast, I'm going to cry
[4:51:35] pereadin: @Trestle @Rylexthegreat the difference is I held the #1-#7 holy paladin ranking in M+ for the better part of the start of the past few seasons so I would hope I know what I'm talking about
[4:51:36] Jram269: 178 mage?

[5:50:39] ForklyftTV: @Towelliee most guilds on my server were having issues getting a full 40 for nax last night
[5:50:40] Industree: Took first place to do it in 1:30
[5:50:44] snoo_32: Holy pally is not good in SL but i notice mist weaver monks are also struggling in PvE ?
[5:50:44] tuctman: I think shadowlands is just to good
[5:50:45] billybaroo1: payo will keep classic alive Kappa
[5:50:47] Czyszn: lmao what was the hype over classic what did everyone expect? like the game was good in the past and once you get over the honeymoon phase the game shows its soul
[5:50:58] tawney_owl_: @NabaniSaa Theyre the same they ever were, a DPS healer, but the problem is they made it no fun by instead of nerfing infusion of light they just made the effect worthless
[5:50:58] Lulaboo: I WAS RIGHT
[5:50:59] Wikedlyrics: classic is hard though Kappa
[5:51:10] BananaPeppr: holy shit an all warrior/heals raid beat it in 5 hrs?
[5:51:11] Abbz44: @Towelliee They did it with zero tank spec characters as well. Progress had 18 DPS warriors.
[5:51:12] BananaPeppr: thats so wild lol
[5:51:19] Klarynse: wow
[5:51:21] LtDanAndHisMagicLegs: According to Price is right rules, Lula was wrong!
[5:51:24] Czyszn: i think people think hard = good?
[5:51:24] ThatW0lF: gib hug
[5:51:25] Nightz101: they still playing both but ofc classic went out of content
[5:51:27] Chrysophylax_I: There will always be people who love it and will continue to play it, but at this point I’m not sure if they should even do TBC
[5:51:30] thecynicalshuffler: feel so bad for classic.. they buried that shit like a tomb in the desert
[5:51:31] NabaniSaa: @tawney_owl_ Ah, thanks.
[5:51:37] liqslip: It’s practiced content not surprising
[5:51:42] BananaPeppr: true
[5:51:45] Wooninite: I mean Four horsemen were literally unkillable for a while
[5:52:02] Garrujak: but guise. classic is harder than retail mythics Kappa
[5:52:18] snoo_32: classic PvE is not balanced neither is PvP - too much bursts and strong Talents. I think shadowlands is more balanced from a combat perspective <3
[5:52:20] Zinnister: what's your favorite tank to play so far?
[5:52:22] Alienfromger: classic dead... retail will follow soon Kappa
[5:52:30] jwalen: I have been falling way behind this xpac
[5:52:49] Chrysophylax_I: Do you think TBC will have the same fate?

[5:52:50] Czyszn: what blizzard should do with classic is give it the D3 season treatment
[5:53:06] SpoofAvatar: just cancel TBC
[5:53:08] Abbz44: Dude Black temple is gonna be done in 2 hours as well
[5:53:09] RunningOutOfRAM: How can you kill something that is dead ?
[5:53:16] thecynicalshuffler: on his stream, Esfand said that one different was that their worst geared player was better geared than most guilds best geared players when it originally launched
[5:53:21] teibner94: Thanks to WotLK, everyone has done naxx a stupid amount of times.

[5:56:37] soth_klf: Deathless WoW Castle Nath Run
[5:56:39] Rictamar: I have to say*
[5:56:45] Nuggsz: @GrandmaTroyb ???
[5:56:46] EvoCyberNation: I don't see why Asmon gets so much hype. He is extremely odd and comes off extremely creepy
[5:56:47] evilduckeyes: cyberpunk?
[5:57:02] Catspaw66: So what to make of the top bioware peeps bailing ?
[5:57:03] EvoCyberNation: cyberpunk 2077 looks good
[5:57:21] bapele45: @EvoCyberNation THATS exactly why he gets viewers bro
[5:57:24] tawney_owl_: asmons only cash source is leeching off the hatred of angry wow players he doesnt have any other genres to go to
[5:57:38] its_andyd: im so gonna quit wow for cyberpunk
[5:57:51] ManneehFresh: smart man lol
[5:58:00] Holysal: @its_andyd see back in 3 weeks lol

[5:58:24] Alienfromger: towBook
[5:58:26] snoo_32: towellie is a good alpha leader and confident. Some people (my self included) like that kind of personality <3
[5:58:28] EvoCyberNation: @bapele45 , idk why people see that as appealing? I thought it was because of Asmon's GF lol
[5:58:30] Holysal: @its_andyd ture
[5:58:32] Holysal: true
[5:58:42] AnimalK: Towelliee: Doesn't share money but always willing to share his loot
[5:58:58] Chrysophylax_I: Esfand was struggling last night talking about continuing to stream wow
[5:59:00] NabaniSaa: I hope WoW Classic gets to WoD, so Blizz can make up for their mistakes.
[5:59:03] its_andyd: nice guy t dog
[5:59:03] tawney_owl_: naw dude gatta wait for that 20 second holy light cast time Kappa
[5:59:18] AnimalK: I totally feel ya
[5:59:21] bapele45: AOC IS HAWTTTT
[5:59:25] grim777777: tony hawk isnt to old
[5:59:30] LunarBrigade: @Towelliee How would you rate tanks for your personal play? Favorite from greatest to least. o:
[5:59:31] Chrysophylax_I: Real talk
[5:59:39] Garrujak: TBH I'd kill for a Towelliee content house with Lula's cooking Kreygasm
[5:59:45] Rictamar: their name is terrible...One True King? yikes
[5:59:47] its_andyd: @bapele45 bend her over her congress desk

[5:59:48] Templexx: dude litearlly thinkin the same yesterday
[5:59:50] bearsnuggles: viewers
[6:00:01] WQKPtheDON: they said not enough people knew about the otknetork channel yet
[6:00:02] bapele45: @its_andyd yes pleqase
[6:00:04] DehCantao: just create the hammer squad org
[6:00:21] Abbz44: If Asmon and the other's were hosting the brand channel that would at least help
[6:00:23] malaano: true
[6:00:25] Joniio: all u bitching about the org, a group of freinds created it, creat one yourself Kappa
[6:00:27] The_Old_Dog_: That doesn’t work
[6:00:28] snoo_32: kids like negativity and hispters. They don't like a REAL man with class <3
[6:00:39] Thoreya: idk i think we'll be surprised how many people tune into it
[6:00:41] missyylaneous: Referent power
[6:00:48] snoo_32: asmon is like that guy imo
[6:00:55] Tocketimer: consulting fee for towelliee please
[6:01:09] Czyszn: asmon is the "face" of WoW on twitch tho
[6:01:16] Thoreya: but BDGG signed every single caster theyre going hard too
[6:01:30] charmenti: true
[6:01:37] Exoduc: @Czyszn no freaking thanks LUL
[6:01:38] Chrysophylax_I: Will you be streaming usual schedule that week?
[6:01:44] Dcarter: face LUL
[6:01:46] DelcoAF: he is the face but def not the hair!!!!!
[6:01:47] Garrujak: Thing is that who would watch OTK coverage if guilds like Method won't let them restream their content?
[6:01:47] LekeroleN: Act like Towelliee gaming peeps towKawaii
[6:01:53] LunarBrigade: Asmon IS the One True King ... of OTK. The others are just there for the ride.
[6:01:54] tawney_owl_: If they just did it on their own channel, theyd get the same number of viewers since asmons chat would go there, but now the organization isnt getting the rep from it, its just asmon being connected to it
[6:01:57] Snatchinupyokids: yeah, it should be OTK, not Asmongold and Friends
[6:02:07] wehtham: they spread out their events over all the channels
[6:02:14] bapele45: @Towelliee i dont know why asmon made OTK, he reminds me of those kids in highschool has no friends and just wants to belong
[6:02:15] Czyszn: i mean dont get me wrong is it good that he is the go too? no but thats how it is
[6:02:38] Czyszn: his communinty is toxic but he still the "face" of WoW on twitch and it doesnt help that he looks like a WoW player

[6:02:51] Templexx: some1 clip all this toss it on their subreddit
[6:02:53] snoo_32: i know when running a business or org, it's good to be strong and indepedent. And self reliant and survive
[6:02:56] Aidler: maybe the goal is to just grow asmons channel? at least from asmons view...
[6:03:01] Czyszn: i agree with you towellie just go hard on the org channel
[6:03:08] EvoCyberNation: Asmon will just have people carry him and he'll call them weak if they don't do it on the first pull.
[6:03:12] Chrysophylax_I: It seems to me like Asmon is the biggest motivation behind all this. The others are just kind of going with it. He is trying to carry the team and it will bite him
[6:03:14] RPClipsGTA: RobotTard subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 11 months! 
[6:03:20] DelcoAF: PREACH!!!!
[6:03:22] Finarato: put it on the org and have everyone host it
[6:03:31] Djulio: that channel hasn't been used yet right?
[6:03:45] snoo_32: i got 1 of 9 ads no adblock. Happy to help towellie, and making it a spiritual challenge to watch ads for my mind <3
[6:03:48] tronbadgames: @Towelliee everything on the OTK channel and everyone hosting it
[6:03:48] MrKhanes: i follow it aswell, and i whish the events where on that channel.
[6:03:52] Alienfromger: makes no sense to be part of an org if you have 70% of viewers
[6:03:55] tawney_owl_: Also asmon is an egomaniac, he wants to make it all about him because thats all hes ever done
[6:03:58] HateWeapon: Mizkif isn't even going to/doesn't play WoW
[6:04:08] EvoCyberNation: True @tawney_owl_
[6:04:11] Chrysophylax_I: Or rather, Asmon is the one with the most motivation and brains behind it.
[6:04:23] nocturnal_2195: I agree. to me it doesn't seem like an org yet , as someone else said it kinda seems like asmongold and friends
[6:04:31] Czyszn: yo someone explain to me how mizkif became a part ?
[6:04:37] Joniio: I think they have alot of fun and thats enough for them i belive

[6:05:23] PaInDeAd1: goodfellas, good movie SeemsGood
[6:05:25] EvoCyberNation: @Chrysophylax_I , Asmon likes power. I was watching a stream and multi people knew a fight. Asmon wanted it his way. I'll leave Asmon alone though.
[6:05:33] EvoCyberNation: No need to keep beating a dead tree :)
[6:05:55] nocturnal_2195: @czyszn probably because he's Esfands friend lol

[6:06:34] Chrysophylax_I: @evocybernation Agreed and he’s good at what he does. I think he should have just did the org himself instead instead of making it a friend thing. It will bring drama
[6:06:37] liuwei7923: Hey @Towelliee , do you recommend DH as the best tank for Mythic+ ?
[6:06:40] Czyszn: OTK has growing pains but ask yourself how entertaining can WoW be after patch hype dies?
[6:07:16] Chrysophylax_I: @czyszn Wtf does that even mean?
[6:07:27] syler550: can anyone in chat tell me what hes using to make his bars look like that

[6:08:20] ptperkins: Josh omegalul
[6:08:27] Czyszn: @Chrysophylax_I think about why they created OTK. why for SL hype and to take in that hype and monetize it. after the hype does what is the point of OTK?
[6:08:34] snoo_32: honestly the PvE masters like towellie preach and sloot as well as PvP masters like cdew and pikaboo are what usually keep the wow section alive. They are wow's back bone i think
[6:09:12] nocturnal_2195: @garrujak and that my friend is why you never hire friends and family
[6:09:13] Aidler: @Garrujak agree. It's often not even the best idea to get into business with friends. if it goes bad nothing is left

[6:10:40] GusherTV: Probably ever actually.
[6:10:43] garmin1987: my warlock is 55 and renown 2 its not hard to get
[6:10:43] MrKhanes: I like the renown system.
[6:10:54] ZeethianDragon: i like renown
[6:10:58] Capo367: Its a good battle passs :D
[6:11:00] sintm_: classic example of you cant please everybody lol
[6:11:04] tronbadgames: @Towelliee do you have to complete all 4 aiding/defending quests?
[6:11:04] Chrysophylax_I: @czyszn Lol it has nothing to do with that. That’s like asking what is the point of Method or Icy Veins. It’s an org that will continue to create content and make money regardless of the status of the game.
[6:11:14] snoo_32: i like renown better than a reputation grind, and prefer reputation to be more interactive.
[6:11:28] DeeKeeezy: getting all the other stuff for alts isnt friendly
[6:11:43] nozcystic: pvp n knock it out
[6:11:48] sintm_: dude yes it is lol
[6:12:02] GusherTV: Its very alt friendly.. What do you mean???
[6:12:05] gooberrelic: just goes to show, you cant make everyone happy
[6:12:13] dawntreader123456: The WQ system is silly right now
[6:12:14] Tigerklaue: the 1k anima weekly
[6:12:19] NabaniSaa: Soul Ash.
[6:12:25] BlueBlurPrime: and its the start of the expansion things can change
[6:12:29] DeeKeeezy: anima soul ash renown etc.
[6:12:31] GusherTV: 1k anima takes me a few hours
[6:12:35] BadXo: Torgast catchup on alts is time consuming
[6:12:35] garmin1987: do the pvp weekly
[6:12:36] Mortiie_: 1k isnt hard I got 750 from 1 WQ yesterday lol
[6:12:37] DarthWrex: They wan to get max ilvl on one toon and it carry over to their whole account
[6:12:43] dawntreader123456: I'm stuck with a 145 conduit for my lock because I can't get any from WQs for my spec
[6:12:44] NispyCriblet: that takes like 2 hours max
[6:12:45] Shugnight: anima is so easy jesus christ do you even play the game ha
[6:12:51] ambiotic: and you do the weekly pvp and its over
[6:12:56] xiamrs: just hand me everything
[6:12:57] Abbz44: You do your anima world quests, you do your 2 dungeons. And that's literally it
[6:12:57] kalamari__: how tf is 1k anime PER WEEK hard?
[6:13:00] NabaniSaa: Sanguine Depths on Normal gives you a quest that gives you 750 anima.
[6:13:00] OneVox: what are youall talking about , gathering anima and soul ash is easy as fuck
[6:13:04] Clicklesly: The 750 WQ was a bug that was quickly hotfixed to 250 ^^
[6:13:06] signar101: @mortiie_ that one was apparently a bug, fixed last night. Gave only 250 after fix =/
[6:13:06] nozcystic: pvp is even faster
[6:13:08] j_hooligan: i got a renown on a alt from a mythic dungeon last night
[6:13:08] nozcystic: anima
[6:13:09] garmin1987: all u got to do is play the game and it will do itself easy
[6:13:10] ZeethianDragon: play the fkn game lol. it's so easy to get anima
[6:13:11] Finarato: i think there's this false expectation that your alt will be as geared as your main but much quicker. So yeah you won't have the same soul ash etc unless you put the same time in. That being said... it still doesn't take long.
[6:13:12] Madjack007: Would be nice to give the option of skipping the intro.
[6:13:16] NabaniSaa: F
[6:13:17] NispyCriblet: there is a theater of pain quest that gives 750 anima
[6:13:24] Abbz44: If it was 1k anima every day yes you'd be struggling. Which is why it's not per day
[6:13:29] Fangy_Playz: @Towelliee What's next after DH? Bear or Warrior?
[6:13:29] OneVox: do your dungeon weeklies
[6:13:33] Chrysophylax_I: @imalwaysmadbro You not playing right then lol
[6:13:39] Ebkwow: I leveled my rogue first and then a warrior and my warrior turned out to be more geared than my rogue
[6:13:57] dwendiqt: wq in EU today gave 750
[6:13:57] pan2142: Dont forget alliance get 500 from overwhelming odds
