[0:29:09] tvilk: The aldrachi were an ancient race of proud and indomitable warriors, renowned for their might and incredible resilience. They were one of the few to ever stand against the Burning Legion; when Sargeras offered them a place in the Legion, the aldrachi refused, slaying innumerable demons before Sargeras himself killed their greatest champion, Toranaar, and ordered the Legion to bathe their homeworld in fel fire for all time.

[0:34:01] tvilk: yeah you 2x wrath into starfire spam

[0:37:05] nash25pl: if they dont nerft cat dps that is
[0:37:18] tvilk: doesnt matter if they nerf, you get omega dmg from these talents
[0:37:32] tvilk: you're probably gonna play wildstalker in m+ and the Keeper of the Grove hero talents in raid
[0:37:33] nash25pl: i expect some rework on druid overall tree either way  atm class and spec talents are a mess
[0:38:05] Heetz23: scripe this is not xiv

[0:43:54] Heetz23: pretty sure top has minor spoilers, around p4 of top
[0:43:58] Heetz23: because of the check drama
[0:44:09] halfwaythug: ohh yay ...already looking forward to seeing those mass disintegrates in arenas
[0:44:10] Heetz23: and when people were losing their mind during the race KEKL
[0:44:28] Hozzar1: i have the video about top and dsr i'll check if it spoils the other fights you haven't done yet. time to walk the dogs :)

[0:48:14] Eliannoula: destiny 2 eh? just saw the 'we want you' caster edition :D
[0:52:26] stillsuitstk: It sounds hard to learn as a player
[0:53:02] halfwaythug: they allways make us relearn our classes to then take half the expansion  to balance them and make it work - love it :D
[0:53:08] Thoreya: raid seems balanced rn no?
[0:53:10] stillsuitstk: SoD rn is pretty good ACTUALY
[0:53:20] Thoreya: for retail
[0:53:21] stillsuitstk: balance way

[1:03:15] Reizmaud: it was above
[1:03:22] Blarkaz: shake the heavens is right above
[1:03:26] Reizmaud: above
[1:04:39] SparrowONE: Spell name generator... just saying. And yes, it's a thing.
[1:05:05] stillsuitstk: Chat GPT, create new spells for wow!
[1:05:06] sinclsw23: sounds pretty close
[1:05:08] keijihanda: KEKW
[1:05:19] Eliannoula: when you heal crit your heal does 25% less dmg but becomes an aoe xD
[1:05:32] Saabernitee: so you can run to them and hug them haha
[1:06:23] Saabernitee: i think we need a sit down with the people at blizz and scripe
[1:09:03] Kemskemss: there can't be too much hammers, right? right?
[1:10:18] Echo_Esports: Time for a break...from your current job? Come work with Echo! Apply at: echogg.ly/apply/Scripe
[1:10:22] kontcuk: so they removed hit rate and weapon skills because it was too confusing and nobody understood them but they are okay with these
[1:10:34] stillsuitstk: sayuwuYikes sayuwuYikes sayuwuYikes sayuwuYikes
[1:10:48] kontcuk: why can't it be your <baseline skill> deal 5% more damage and has 1% increased crit rate
[1:10:54] Eliannoula: how the fuck is hit rate confusing?
[1:10:54] vitaax13: Looks fun, so many hammers falling from the sky
[1:10:56] Kemskemss: wdym? where is it going?
[1:11:08] Reizmaud: its just a talents ..
[1:11:46] Kemskemss: well, if they canâ€™t #deleteAug, they can fuck it :D
[1:12:04] stillsuitstk: ok boomer, back to tetris
[1:12:20] Kemskemss: did u watch AutomaticJak video â€˜is WoW too complicatedâ€™?
[1:12:41] stegebro0: maybe instead of 3 lines in per column only 2 lines
[1:13:23] Dukkemanden: what would you have liked it to be instead
[1:13:26] Kelsillium: that 60% of damage to nearby enemies just looks like passive aoe with a damage mitigation included, sounds uncomplicated to me
[1:13:44] vitaax13: They should've focused on improving the current talents and balance
[1:14:06] Kemskemss: I havenâ€™t watched myself, still waiting for any of my streamers to share an experience KEKW
[1:14:07] stillsuitstk: pruning

[1:14:54] Kemskemss: yeah, thereâ€™s a chain of reactions happening
[1:15:09] Heetz23: i dont think wow is complicated, people just dont want to learn..
[1:15:18] Heetz23: i got into wow during s2 of DF
[1:15:21] Heetz23: ended getting CE
[1:15:25] Heetz23: was my first time
[1:15:32] Kemskemss: Jak (and Public) is also leaning towards an idea of hero talents being a cosmetic ones
[1:15:33] Heetz23: (did it as a holy paladin)
[1:15:47] vitaax13: No way
[1:15:57] Oxlls7560: u must off had a top 100 guild
[1:16:00] KaisenSiru: anniesCopium triSUS
[1:16:00] Oxlls7560: carrying u at minium
[1:16:01] Instylee: show logs time
[1:16:03] Heetz23: im a xiv player
[1:16:09] stillsuitstk: must be a 8 yo gigachad
[1:16:10] Heetz23: that did the change to wow
[1:16:13] Kemskemss: boosted CE? xd
[1:16:22] Heetz23: nope
[1:16:26] Oxlls7560: yes
[1:16:27] Heetz23: i applied to a guild with my XIV logs
[1:16:29] Julowayne: AOTC or CE ?
[1:16:29] Oxlls7560: send proof
[1:16:33] VacaSlamBang: there is so much info on the internet nowadays you dont really need that much game knowledge if you are eager to learn, you just do your homework and execute properly
[1:16:34] Marev_tv: Top 1000 guild can grind it to CE after all the nerfs
[1:16:35] Heetz23: and 1 guy played XIV
[1:16:37] Heetz23: and accepted me
[1:16:38] Echo_Esports: Gear up for raid with a world-class sitting experience. Enjoy the same long-lasting comfort as Echo, only with the Secretlab TITAN Evo gaming chair: echogg.ly/secretlab/Scripe

[1:16:40] kontcuk: yeah but the thing is 90% of the people who gets CE don't know what the fuck their talents do
[1:16:40] Dukkemanden: thats cap
[1:16:43] ollehxd: who gives a shit whether hes lying or not lel
[1:16:46] kontcuk: i know because nobody in my guild do
[1:16:49] kontcuk: nor in my server
[1:16:54] stillsuitstk: boosted
[1:16:59] Heetz23: during 1-2 months i was a sponge
[1:17:04] Heetz23: learnning about wow
[1:17:40] Kemskemss: @VacaSlamBang u do need a game knowledge to execute properly tho. experience is a type of knowledge too
[1:17:48] Marev_tv: I mean with enough time you can get CE first tier. IF you play 12-16h a day it shouldn't be hard. It's like 3.7k rio, you can grind it
[1:17:59] vitaax13: Ffxiv has no talents and its fine
[1:18:03] Laustboi: wow isnt too complicated u just had to be a sponge for 2 months :)
[1:18:11] CaptainAlkohol: strong beard game scripe
[1:18:12] lesterow428: they shouldve just went with maybe one new ability and cosmetics instead of "hero talents"
[1:18:14] stillsuitstk: sayuwuDed
[1:18:18] VacaSlamBang: @Kemskemss as i said, you can do it with 0 knowledge, just do your research, do your homework and play the game, you will eventually get used to it
[1:18:25] KaisenSiru: KEKW
[1:18:32] Laustboi: idc either way but interesting argument
[1:18:39] Heetz23: well, it depends
[1:18:43] Heetz23: some games are like that
[1:18:46] Marev_tv: IF you are good with data, WCL can show you everything, then just practice
[1:18:49] VacaSlamBang: and that is considering that wow is not really a new player friendly game ( if you wanna be somewhat competetive)
[1:19:31] Kemskemss: and an argument to be made about the amount of homework you HAVE to do to play a game. Even for a casual andy. When did it become a norm T_T
[1:19:55] iden_26: especally if you have a job and dont play all day... for two months. and dont have someone to coach you
[1:20:05] vitaax13: Yeah everyone just uses wowhead talents so what is the point of the complexity
[1:20:16] bizzenwow: W take
[1:20:19] Marev_tv: Yea I agree with that, but then there would me much less players in WoW. Coz ppl just want to hop in and enjoy, not think
[1:20:24] stillsuitstk: I simmed 650 dps on a new (today) patch
[1:20:35] liarawaifu: imagine if a newbie spent 2 months learning to play something like Feral only for them to never get invited into high end content and have to reroll and learn for another 2 months something else
[1:20:35] Kemskemss: @stillsuitstk Pog
[1:20:35] Heetz23: @iden_26 its funny that the thing that took me the longest time to learn during wow as a healer, was not dpsing as much
[1:21:00] SharakUK: i've come back to the retail game recently from classic - the new talents coming into it fresh eyed is a bit overwhelming. context is required for proper learning and if you're picking up a brand new spec and have no reference what any of these spells/talents do its really stupid
[1:21:18] Heetz23: UI and addons was a nightmare, good thing naowh UI existed
[1:21:38] Heetz23: otherwise i think i would have quitted wow at minute 1 installing so many addons
[1:22:29] KaisenSiru: triHmm anniesHmm
[1:23:10] J0kEx: i mean if multipale options are around the same dps then it depends on what we prefer. that would be cool but hard to achieve

[1:25:13] lesterow428: lol exactly what i said. copycat :D
[1:25:19] vitaax13: Yeah just class skins with super cool animations
[1:25:31] kontcuk: each class has like 20 baseline abilities already, increase their effectiveness instead of adding 84375834 new skills and 58475 random procs
[1:25:35] Heetz23: now that i think, on xiv most classes get like 1-2 buttons, and some traits that changes how other abilities work
[1:25:57] Heetz23: like instea of adding 1-5, they just turn 1 skill into another more powerful  at X level
[1:26:02] stryP6: is this is gonna be SL covenant fiesta all over?
[1:26:05] Harleybane: fireblast has a chance to conjure a stack of water when casted KEKW
[1:26:44] fetza108: @stryp6 hope not or is it?
[1:27:15] kontcuk: so you'd prefer convergence of fates type of trinkets?
[1:27:39] Harleybane: pvp prob
[1:27:54] Kelsillium: Thats some total ARPG design tb
[1:28:02] Hozzar1: @scripe good morning, how's the meetings yesterday?
[1:28:20] Kemskemss: and theyâ€™re adding more defensives! why not after all xd
[1:28:34] Geckoos: cant wait to mass disintegrate
[1:28:40] Geckoos: gonna look so dope
[1:28:42] stryP6: if i just press judgment then heal myself with flash and throw this hammer, i take 15% less damage for 5 seconds atrocitySad
[1:29:04] Harleybane: just an FYI, i was looking through some old screenshots, we are more button bloat now than in MoP when they did the bloat reduction
[1:29:06] muscanpepsi02: @stryP6 scripeKEKW
[1:29:18] fetza108: My big problem with retail is the button bloat... if they will add more buttons i will never log in
[1:29:28] Heetz23: is there to get to meteor clearly Kappa
[1:29:30] keijihanda: is d3 devs team doing WoW now? KEKW
[1:29:33] Hozzar1: In the shaman tree you have to pick up wind shear if you want earth elemental
[1:29:42] molo316: atleast shards of domination was cool proc Kappa
[1:30:02] Kemskemss: @fetza108 I donâ€™t think weâ€™ve seen any buttons added through hero talents so far. just passive effects
[1:30:11] deliora7: bro imagine playing outlaw rogue that has a ridiculously span of buttons to press and blizzard is like yeah now u have to implement fuckin feint as a baseline ability AS A GENERATOR like who came up with this cause there is no way you have ever even seen rogue gameplay to come up with this trickster has to be the weirdest thing ever..
[1:30:14] kontcuk: shards of domination had at least some agency that you could gear towards more self healing instead of maximum damage
[1:30:15] Dukkemanden: isnt that basically what that is - it just adds it into a different ability in your logs/details
[1:30:25] Dukkemanden: and it lets them add some visual flair that fits the raid
[1:30:46] Dukkemanden: I love my divebombing owls
[1:30:47] Hozzar1: In the shaman tree you have to pick up wind shear just to have earth elemental
[1:30:51] keijihanda: True KEKW

[1:31:20] Kemskemss: @fetza108 if Iâ€™m not mistaken it was a huge concern on players part, and I hope blizz heard it
[1:33:00] qudus: the more random skills that apear with a lucky %ge, the more out of control your class feels like.
[1:33:02] KaisenSiru: Seeds Pog
[1:33:08] fetza108: If you wanna relaxing in retail you just do solo content but if you wanna challenge ehich is not relaxing for me on a higher level you do keys and raiding.
[1:33:28] fetza108: *which
[1:34:17] Geckoos: personally i love how it is right now
[1:34:51] Harleybane: if i need to press more than 15 diff buttons during a fight, its a bad design.(i play brew)
[1:35:06] savke3: but mage talenets let say 40% passiv talents what you have in sl :(
[1:35:09] TheRatPresident: user error
[1:35:10] Hozzar1: @Harleybane ff14 wants to have a weird with you
[1:35:12] chugphilly: a lot of talents should just be given for a lot of classes. every clas should have a kick n a way to deal with affixes like incropor afflicted
[1:35:13] Kemskemss: probably a bunch of things should be a baseling. itâ€™s making trees lighter and yet gives an option
[1:35:26] chugphilly: kick sholdnt have to be talented into.
[1:35:29] Heetz23: @Hozzar1 imagine if he did OPTIMAL stuff on blm
[1:35:30] fetza108: @harleybane brew is the worst probably
[1:35:36] Harleybane: @Hozzar1 im a PF hardcore pugger in ffxiv, different game.
[1:36:05] stegebro0: Mass Dispell
[1:36:39] Chimix1: Warlock and banish probably
[1:37:06] dimsy__: react inception PogU
[1:37:22] Hozzar1: 4 layers deep
[1:37:23] Kemskemss: @dimsy__ it went five levels from what Iâ€™ve seen xd
[1:37:26] fetza108: Honestly i would love less active ability/less button and more passive ability
[1:37:40] Heetz23: @Hozzar1 would you think, mythic should become glam(transmog) only?
[1:37:50] Eliannoula: 14 doesn't have trinketsy
[1:37:54] Hozzar1: @Scripe they don't want that tbf
[1:38:00] Eliannoula: and we get a support caster with dawntrail
[1:38:26] Heetz23: @Eliannoula poggcrazy
[1:38:31] stillsuitstk: I wish ff had some better customisation, other than choosing a class and having better ilvl
[1:39:02] savke3: but are the herotalents not passive ?
[1:39:04] savke3: yea
[1:39:08] fetza108: With these many expansions the problem too there are zones where you can change the timelines.... imagine if you are a new player.
[1:39:47] Eliannoula: for FF you have to think of the jobs as speccs for the position you wanna play and then variance in skill/spellspeed
[1:39:57] stillsuitstk: It's impossible to knew lore
[1:40:01] stillsuitstk: as a new player
[1:40:01] Echo_Esports: Celebrate Echo's latest win in the RWF with the New World First mousepad and loads of other great merch at echogg.ly/merch/Scripe
[1:40:13] chugphilly: adding a new layer to the game isnt always good. they are doing it to make evry class viable and right now they all feel very good besides high key meta but that doesnt mean you cant run another class
[1:40:58] Heetz23: like a preset UI ?
[1:41:04] Hozzar1: like gw2
[1:41:05] Hozzar1: KEKW
[1:41:15] deliora7: click them thats the right way the only way
[1:41:29] vitaax13: and recommended keybinds for spells
[1:41:58] stillsuitstk: hire (lol) addon authors, make a decent standard ui, ban all addons
[1:41:58] kiirpii: one of my friend started to wow  first time 3 months ago, with hekili he figured out how to play character and he did really good after a while. he is discovering all characters, doing some m+ and he reached 3.3k :D
[1:42:13] s_t_o_r_m__: I have a Naga for keybings, most not all
[1:42:18] fetza108: @stillsuitstk if you are a new player you should do mimimum the loremaster achievement but they wont. That is a big project. I did LUL
[1:42:30] stillsuitstk: Or a keyboard map
[1:42:55] stegebro0: The defult keybinds for wow should also be changed
[1:43:25] Kelsillium: Shift modifiers are annoying for some people
[1:43:35] Nightbot: @Harleybane -> Piece of cake. [stop posting links] [warning]
[1:43:52] stillsuitstk: Shift are good for me but ctrl already annoying
[1:43:55] Kemskemss: @Kelsillium Iâ€™m one of them. alt all the way
[1:44:16] stegebro0: immediatly 400 new installations
[1:44:19] Hozzar1: !permit harleybane
[1:44:20] Nightbot: @Hozzar1 -> harleybane has been granted permission to post a link for 60 seconds.

[1:44:41] Harleybane: but check the reddit one
[1:44:53] Harleybane: https://www.reddit.com/r/WowUI/comments/16tuvx3/keyui_visualize_keyboard_and_mouse_bindings_addon/
[1:44:56] stillsuitstk: dedge
[1:45:03] Harleybane: reddit one is 5months old
[1:45:06] kontcuk: 7 was wod right
[1:45:19] vitaax13: legion
[1:45:20] stillsuitstk: 7 is a legion i think
[1:45:32] stillsuitstk: last good expa
[1:45:37] stillsuitstk: scripePalm
[1:45:44] kontcuk: don't disrespect shadowlands like that
[1:46:04] stillsuitstk: sayuwuOho shadowland on deez nuts
[1:47:02] stegebro0: click on the arrwow
[1:47:06] stegebro0: it works
[1:47:12] Harleybane: Hu, ive used it without naga

[1:47:15] stegebro0: choose layout
[1:47:26] stillsuitstk: oh no it will reset your keybinds lol
[1:47:35] Harleybane: now gimme a sub to kush
[1:47:36] Harleybane: KEKW
[1:47:45] Kemskemss: whatâ€™s the purpose of that thing?
[1:48:37] zerossussy: whats that cool addon
[1:49:10] stillsuitstk: teaching worldfirst raider something new
[1:49:25] chugphilly: i am getting this LOL
[1:49:31] chugphilly: this is very good
[1:49:35] Harleybane: the hardcore way of doing it is printing out all the icons and posting a imagine on your monitor
[1:49:38] Kemskemss: @Harleybane I gotchu, homie <3
[1:49:38] Hozzar1: @Scripe can you get a echo member to make a newer version of this?>
[1:49:42] zerossussy: whats the name of the addon
[1:49:43] zerossussy: ?
[1:49:52] Harleybane: @Kemskemss my maaan kushiGamer
[1:49:57] s_t_o_r_m__: @Harleybane or just play 8 hours a day
[1:50:03] zerossussy: ty
[1:50:36] s_t_o_r_m__: you can make caps to be alt
[1:50:37] stegebro0: how do you even use shift k ?!
[1:50:42] stillsuitstk: I got it for sod
[1:50:50] Harleybane: @stegebro0 turkish hands
[1:50:55] cixtx: shift K, insane fingers
[1:51:02] Hozzar1: @Scripe can you get a echo member to update/ make a newer version of this?
[1:51:09] Kemskemss: how do you use it? T_T how does it help?
[1:51:15] Julowayne: yeah no way i can reach shift k
[1:51:16] Geckoos: shift j is where it ends for me
[1:51:28] Harleybane: my worst one is ctrl f7
[1:52:02] Kelsillium: Shift and Ctrl modifiers I find easiest in combat only if the button it's modifying is on my mouse, no stretching needed
[1:52:46] Harleybane: except affli lock and feral
[1:52:49] Geckoos: press 1-5 do damage
[1:52:50] chugphilly: brewmaster has too many buttons holy shit 30+ buttons is wild
[1:53:00] Harleybane: @chugphilly i got 48 keybinds as brew
[1:53:30] chugphilly: @Harleybane yeah i can see it. macros and verything else for it is wild. too many to remember
[1:53:32] fetza108: Windwalker has a lot too i think
[1:53:39] Harleybane: aint fun. if they dont prune brew i wont even lvl it in tww
[1:53:49] chugphilly: you have to put in 1k hours to play it very good
[1:53:51] Sikkbass: Don't have iceblock then bro
[1:53:59] Hozzar1: people did ask for it back
[1:54:01] Hozzar1: KEKBye
[1:54:02] keijihanda: never KEKW

[1:54:05] J0kEx: i use it to reset bosses ^^
[1:54:05] Hozzar1: KEKW
[1:54:05] faithcraft: PvP
[1:54:20] zerossussy: alt f4 is a better keybind for frostbolt KEKW
[1:54:28] Charm_pit: pvp?
[1:54:32] Speelix_: Shadowlands to trigger legy :D
[1:54:34] zerossussy: OH YES HE WAS CASTING IT
[1:54:43] zerossussy: he was casting frost bolt instead of fire bolt as fire mage in mdi
[1:54:55] zerossussy: it was in necrotic wake
[1:54:57] zerossussy: i think
[1:54:57] fetza108: 10-15 button should be enough
[1:55:24] zerossussy: so he never got hotstreaks from firebolt KEKW
[1:55:31] Googen: maybe add a [spec:n] modifier to the macro?
[1:55:36] Harleybane: @chugphilly even worse with the burst window, cuz its like a 12+ seconds opener with WoO and stacking + trinkets and bdb/ek and all the other shit to keep up meanwhile
[1:55:40] EmElw: its when you queue it
[1:56:12] zerossussy: u have to place it in spellqueue
[1:56:13] lesterow428: you have to finish the cast
[1:56:16] zerossussy: for it to work
[1:56:17] EmElw: its when you queue it ó €€
[1:56:25] zerossussy: spellqueue
[1:56:48] Harleybane: wf1 raider, cant attack a bettle
[1:57:05] EmElw: its cause it queues the last spell in the macro
[1:57:08] kontcuk: queue it after another channel
[1:57:18] zerossussy: u have to spell queue not initial cast
[1:57:27] zerossussy: thats how the macro bugs out
[1:57:38] zerossussy: well its not exactly a bug because its the final cast of spell queue
[1:57:44] zerossussy: which is normal
[1:57:55] stillsuitstk: it looks sad
[1:58:01] stillsuitstk: purple bubble
[1:58:07] Molly336: Arcane explosion no 1 farming spell
[1:59:02] EmElw: i wonder if jak's only played healer in ffxiv hmjj
[1:59:09] EmElw: cause that certainly skews your perspective
[2:01:02] stillsuitstk: FREE STUFF? Sure but pay 100$ for expa
[2:01:06] zerossussy: class halls were full of cool shit
[2:01:10] zasaru__: why new transfer? doesnt next expac have crossrealm guilds anyways?
[2:01:21] Heetz23: i wish wow fixed the colors during fights, red room with red aoes, with a red floor
[2:01:23] Heetz23: is so bad..
[2:01:35] zasaru__: oh right
[2:01:37] Echo_Esports: Want to learn from the best? Visit echogg.ly/coaching/Scripe and pick the Echo player that suits your needs!
[2:01:57] zerossussy: races must be cosmetic alot of ppl are complaining about it yea
[2:02:08] Vendethtv: They should make "Raid Talents" and "Dungeon Talents"
[2:02:11] Vendethtv: honestly
[2:02:13] Heetz23: @zerossussy ye, make it like xiv, is just cosmetic
[2:02:16] Vendethtv: solves the problems
[2:02:34] EmElw: what of the hero talents actually add buttons so far? most of them have been pretty good about not just adding new buttons from what i remember
[2:02:37] Kemskemss: @Vendethtv modifiers maybe, but not new shit
[2:02:43] EmElw: the new warrior one looks kinda dumb but other than that?
[2:02:45] Heetz23: just add racials into the talent tree, next to the pvp talents
[2:02:53] Heetz23: you can freely choose etc
[2:02:54] EmElw: like the flipover paladin spell is fine right?
[2:02:58] shentaj: aberrus was easier than vault no?
[2:03:05] zasaru__: FLASHBANG
[2:03:39] Kemskemss: blizz raises power creep in all of its games. I wonder if itâ€™s a choice or unavoidable if your games are old
[2:03:40] Heetz23: dont touch UI addons
[2:03:43] Heetz23: or i quit
[2:03:44] s_t_o_r_m__: more complex content = more time required to complete it
[2:03:51] EmElw: blizz would have to start paying their devs to actually make a good ui PepeLaugh
[2:04:09] Eliannoula: @Kemskemss powercreep is unavoidable, but how big it is, is a choice
[2:04:23] Kemskemss: @Eliannoula good point
[2:04:35] Heetz23: Wonder if mythic raiding would attract more people if the rewards was transmog, instead of gear
[2:04:41] Harleybane: if minmaxing werent a thing i wouldnt play. thats half the fun
[2:05:11] Heetz23: @Heetz23 (referencing XIV ultimates)
[2:05:12] shentaj: have ppl thought about just getting good instead of complaining?
[2:05:26] iamwodan: git gud
[2:05:32] zerossussy: 0.01% of the game are on the right side
[2:05:37] Harleybane: scripe your ui is horrible KEKW
[2:05:56] zerossussy: many top players provide a top tier UI just by subbing to them
[2:05:59] zerossussy: like atrocity
[2:05:59] Maakanv: your ui is weird but none can flame you since you are in charge of the ebst guild in the game
[2:06:36] Heetz23: @Maakanv for the normal human being , yeah weird af, but for scripe, understandable
[2:06:42] shentaj: thats not true. a good spec UI is easily available on wago
[2:07:14] Heetz23: @shentaj there is a problem with that, wago UIS doesnt come with addons like streamer UIS
[2:07:21] Fantaisie: season of discovery retail edition Pog
[2:07:23] EmElw: isnt this what hero talent accomplish? small changes to specs that feel a little different but you wont stack 2 or 3 hero talents on top of each other
[2:07:31] shentaj: everything else is a problem sure but tracking your own class isnt
[2:07:38] Heetz23: if naowhUI didnt come with all the addons, i dont think my time on wow would have been much
[2:07:40] EmElw: so next expac they add new sidegrades that dont stack on top of the ones from war within
[2:08:03] EmElw: my read is that theyre basically copying elite specs from gw2 which does all of this
[2:08:04] Kelsillium: Wouldn't that force players to change to a spec that has their playstyle?
[2:08:17] Echo_Esports: Gear up for raid with a world-class sitting experience. Enjoy the same long-lasting comfort as Echo, only with the Secretlab TITAN Evo gaming chair: echogg.ly/secretlab/Scripe
[2:09:03] Instylee: we are playing almost the same mage since shadowlands lmao
[2:09:57] Kemskemss: just buff underperfoming talents to force ppl switch talents. it would change playstyle and add new buttons instead but not in a major way. could be fun
[2:11:18] kaverrr: Nothing is easy with Blizzard
[2:11:37] Heetz23: @Scripe just contract yoshi-p to fix it COPIUM
[2:12:10] J0kEx: that pyro + skb combination was super good. be4 that it was just hardcast pyro city
[2:12:27] Kemskemss: Scripe is very stretchy today
[2:13:23] Heetz23: if only the free trial of wow didnt suck..
[2:13:31] Heetz23: on xiv you can play up to lvl 70 for free
[2:13:32] Kemskemss: thanks for watching and for discussin! <3

[5:13:23] kingsize1g: wl solo bombs
[5:13:30] GH0STtdi: itâ€™s easier if the range get assigned sections
[5:13:57] Incendo: FFA who ever  is closer should click, but it can also be  assigned, bomber men can come from the same place twice and you would need help reguardless
[5:15:18] GH0STtdi: mage pumps if you only focus dps
[5:15:43] LtBrowncoat: you might when lots of bombs drop and no one kills them

[5:17:19] Incendo: you kinda want to  click button on CD  to get the mana  as a healer
[5:17:22] Rxwr: You can click the red buttons on cd, so you keep trading hp for mana
[5:17:25] ImmaNewbie: Mana button on cd script :D
[5:17:38] Jumaji: Last phase robocop has half health compared to previous phases. So it's the same amount of health you go through each phase.
[5:17:42] LtBrowncoat: someone just pressed that one
[5:17:53] GH0STtdi: want to save evoc for phase 3 I think
[5:18:04] LtBrowncoat: as healer you should go near one button and keep clicking that
[5:18:09] tussmack: you can go press it during the phase intermission like that spriest just did, no bombs to worry about

[8:29:16] Hozzar1: i hate wa's
[8:29:22] Hozzar1: those sounds are annoying
[8:30:00] tussmack: i assume they buy a full boost and get anything they want including mount
[8:30:20] Kemskemss: @Fiuu_ nope

[8:33:44] Hozzar1: i'll never tip
[8:33:46] Hozzar1: fuck tip
[8:33:58] Hozzar1: fuck tipping
[8:34:29] NarutoEU: Does the buyer get all loot that he need ? How this works ?
[8:34:45] tussmack: ya its RNG so he's lucky it seems
[8:34:46] Eliannoula: yes
[8:34:59] Eliannoula: when you buy a boost you get the loot of said boss
[8:35:08] Eliannoula: in a 9/9 you get everything including mount
[8:35:13] Kemskemss: @NarutoEU I think it depends on the amount of money u put. u could buy option with the loot or just for an achievement
[8:35:19] NarutoEU: damn
[8:35:42] NarutoEU: So some random token seller can get 9/9 and 489 stuff ???
[8:35:45] Eliannoula: @Kemskemss nah its flat, buy a 7/9 you get the loot of the bosses you buy for
[8:35:49] Eliannoula: yes
[8:36:12] Kemskemss: @Eliannoula ok, but there're options -) like not everyone buys from Echo
[8:36:14] Elluk1: can you show you stats ?
[8:36:15] Hozzar1: what's your opinion of tipping culture personally i'll never tip because i don't like the fact food owners don't pay their staff properly
[8:36:50] Kemskemss: I tip if I like the person. Otherwise fuck it. As it turned out, I tip very often :D
[8:36:56] Arkismall: @Hozzar1 So you just shit on the underpayed person :D How does that affect the owners :D
[8:37:29] Hozzar1: @Arkismall because the mangers should pay the staff properly
[8:37:34] Hozzar1: peepoSmile
[8:37:38] topazz12: tipping is such an usa thing
[8:37:45] Eliannoula: @Kemskemss well ya but the person asked for echo i thinkl
[8:37:55] Hozzar1: i'll happily pay more so i don't have to tip
[8:38:14] Hozzar1: ie pay more for food
[8:39:00] Maitel: I feel like you should tip if th service is good, but if its not then why would you
[8:39:06] Kemskemss: @Eliannoula I tend to overexplain, I'm sorry for that
[8:39:27] Eliannoula: nah you good, don't worry
[8:39:52] Hozzar1: https://www.forbes.com/sites/jackkelly/2023/08/01/tipflation-americans-think-tipping-culture-is-out-of-control-and-employees-should-be-paid-more/

[8:41:33] Kemskemss: @Hozzar1 I think it's true for a lot of starting positions
[8:41:47] Maitel: @MaelarethTV yes he yapped a lot
[8:41:47] Hozzar1: @Kemskemss i think it's an american problem to be fair
[8:41:55] Hozzar1: at least in the uk you're not expected to tip
[8:42:17] Hozzar1: it's like a microtransation
[8:42:21] Kemskemss: in tip regard maybe, but in being underpaid when u start... fck capitalism in general
[8:43:22] Pegrnator: @Kemskemss capitalism is awesome mate
[8:43:58] Kemskemss: @Pegrnator allow me to have my issues with it -) it doesn't hurt anyone
[8:44:50] Pegrnator: @Kemskemss allow me to tell how awesome it is, it doesnt hurt anyone
[8:45:03] Qazin1337: True and based
[8:45:30] Xencez: Nice headset! Which one are u buying after next race? :D
[8:45:57] tussmack: if you guys sell the mount every week does that mean that some main raiders miss out on it, or is that never an issue?
[8:46:20] Maitel: there are two mounts that drop each time I think
[8:46:28] tussmack: ooh
[8:46:39] tussmack: ya i dont play retail :)
[8:47:06] Maitel: at least in the boosts I saw there were two, so I presume that
