[0:24:53] MrDismemberTV: but if anyone claims to do an epoxy in one day, find someone else. it's a 3 day thing, grind the floors, dust has to settle, clean up the dust and first layer, let it dry, next day toss chips and put a clear coat on top and let it dry. But almost all good ones take 3 days.
[0:24:56] ansiedeadx: assa is to bad now?

[3:18:52] RSN_Thicc_Dylf: can we get some assassination action @Pikabooirl ?
[3:18:54] ostreidiis: Mineral deposits are also known as hard water spots, water stains, and watermarks. They are mostly calcium and magnesium but sometimes contain soap scum residue and salts from water softeners. It's common to find them on kitchen and bath countertops, sinks, and glass shower doors. Mineral deposits on quartz countertops require specific cleaning methods to remove them without causing a dull spot or blemish. Got this from the web
[3:18:59] Th3s1c0n3: @Reaperz_kinetic Might be right, obviously not how i like it lol
[3:18:59] Farfetchdxx: if you don't like the look, don't settle for it
[3:19:01] rizdane: those are definately spots from something
[3:19:13] Shakertime: you have the reference pics?

[3:19:16] matt_caste: what'd your dad say about the spots
[3:19:16] betruez: material name?
[3:19:21] takhsick: make sure you go look at yours in person before you rail him

[3:19:28] quinnm27: do u play sub in 3s or swap to outlaw for 3s? @Pikabooirl
[3:19:35] nesr1n: is it slate?
[3:19:35] Reaperz_kinetic: @Th3s1c0n3 tbh i dont either when its smaller tiles like that. ive seen it with larger tiles that looks good but the smaller ones kinda look weird like that
[3:19:39] Synystor: Haven't seen any tiles with spots, but there are some that looked "washed"
[3:19:42] bigwalletgangsta: question everyyyyyyyyyyything. make them prove to you something is done correctly, otherwise they will pull the wool over your eyes. builders are wild these days
[3:19:48] drfeltgood: The stuff he got offthe web is if the counter has been used and gotten water onit
[3:20:06] betruez: im gonna ask around ill get back at you tomorrow
[3:20:15] Thee_Hopper: not a big fan of the crack look on it
[3:20:16] matt_caste: The first thought I had was hard water stains
[3:20:16] rizdane: brother if u clean it and dislike have them redo it. make it how u like
[3:20:17] Reaperz_kinetic: @drfeltgood it looks like it was left out in rain... which for construction homes isnt uncommon
[3:20:23] Synystor: Honestly that looks like chemical spots from someone trying to clean it
[3:20:28] nesr1n: quartz is very durable
[3:20:47] drfeltgood: @Reaperz_kinetic Tahts what I was thinking
[3:20:51] rizdane: ok...
[3:20:56] RSN_Thicc_Dylf: granite and quartz is cut with water and looks splotchy till it is cleaned, chined and finished @Pikabooirl
[3:20:59] rizdane: google imaged yes it looks like that
[3:21:07] RSN_Thicc_Dylf: shined*
[3:21:09] drfeltgood: @Pikabooirl Ill call my stone guy in the morning and ask what he thinks
[3:21:12] Reaperz_kinetic: @drfeltgood its definitely not normal ive NEVER seen something like that
[3:21:19] barret784: quarts can sand and repair
[3:21:19] Chapag3tti: they will prolly come ager it all
[3:21:24] drfeltgood: Or not
[3:21:24] Algooty: Dont you have any preview pics online of the same countertop? see if it has spots
[3:21:25] takhsick: his stone man
[3:21:25] Shakertime: ill call my stone guy as well
[3:21:28] dinkleminkle: I'm stoned, guy
[3:21:34] uhbaku: LMFAO
[3:21:36] nesr1n: should be able to be polished
[3:21:36] drfeltgood: LOL
[3:21:39] takhsick: im very stoned fs
[3:21:48] Allomaternal: whos your stone guy
[3:21:48] Th3s1c0n3: @Reaperz_kinetic To me, if they are rectangle, they should be offset. Like full tile with the next row being half way so the lines dont line up. If its square then line it up. Just put in some in my house and my stepdad does floors for a living so thats probably where i get it
[3:21:48] asloff: LUL
[3:21:53] Thee_Hopper: just sand it down
[3:21:54] BobbyJ135: ill get ahold of my stoned guy aswell
[3:21:54] Synystor: yeahu can make one
[3:21:55] barret784: 1-6 time
[3:21:57] barret784: 1-5
[3:21:59] Doolz51: mine looked similar when I had it installed. We got this cleaner from home depot and it made it SPOTLESS. I forget the name, but if you google itll be highly recommended for sure
[3:22:00] drfeltgood: focus
[3:22:10] drfeltgood: I used a fcous macro for it
[3:22:21] drreww: well now that im an amateur quartz guy... it's not a porous surface.. which means it won't stain.. its op over marble and  looks similar
[3:22:23] matt_caste: does your bot work on enh too or do you just have the ele one?
[3:22:26] niuZIXIao: this is ez 6-0 lobby for enhance
[3:23:09] Chinpoe: Chinpoe subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 24 months! You plan on clapping cheeks on the kitchen island?
[3:23:15] danieltsmoke: shamans are so troll, lol...half the damn match is attempting to click a damn totem
[3:23:23] Reaperz_kinetic: @drreww i agree tbh quartz is bis
[3:23:29] takhsick: hes off doin stuff and thangs
[3:24:10] aquaberry0420: locked in my room
[3:24:12] aquaberry0420: 4 black walls
[3:24:14] Th3s1c0n3: Quartz is good for sure. I personally have granite in the kitchen but bathrooms are quartz
[3:24:17] repti1iano: passive freezing trap lol
[3:24:24] Synystor: Jesus, they are putting every cc into u lol
[3:24:45] rizdane: bro why he hitting warrior
[3:24:47] RSN_Thicc_Dylf: i was a professional mover and worked with a lot of companies that handled those products and we were given a lot of information to basically reassure the customers about possible issues like the one you have here @Pikabooirl
[3:24:50] MilkJugs: beast cleave is back Pog
[3:24:58] barret784: is this a 1300 lobby
[3:25:05] MilkJugs: oh nvm he marks
[3:25:05] samuro_xo: what pomade do you use
[3:25:18] TimmyShoes: aw man i missed roun 1
[3:25:32] niuZIXIao: nothin wrong with the mm hittin war when locks not in his line
[3:26:22] that_man_ski: why is there no demon hunter? that seems like an odd match without a DH
[3:26:23] Reaperz_kinetic: @Th3s1c0n3 i like both the one i just happened to have rn is quartz cause the style of it was great. Also got butcher block which is fucking amazing
[3:26:40] lucki_val: @Pikabooirl  WHEN IS NEXT AWC?
[3:26:47] efgt84: !song
[3:26:47] Nightbot: man of the year - schoolboy q
[3:27:02] markaimfire_: that damage crazy
[3:27:36] yung_jed: a non rng enchance spec actually viable?
[3:27:42] RSN_Thicc_Dylf: hire a crew that handles cleaning, polishing and finishing   your kitchen surfaces before using them. makes cleaning and polishing throughout your ownership a lot less of a headache. dont want you to havfe 1 pasta sauce spill stain it almost perma
[3:27:48] Th3s1c0n3: @Reaperz_kinetic just had to google butcher block. looks nice. would be scared to damage it. Kids are ruthless! lol
[3:27:51] Kirelia467: the song is i rememb er by deadmau5
[3:27:53] harvey_meadowlark: nice fking damage
[3:28:12] TimmyShoes: enh is a weird spec. it's really good in solo shuffle but bad at 2s and mediocre at 3s lol
[3:28:40] HouseOnFire: how do you decide on who to go on? i literally came back to the game to play pvp and learn
[3:28:46] moistydank: I always did enjoy enhance but like ya said it‚Äôs meh besides shuffle hahaha
[3:28:50] barret784: enh needs ms
[3:29:20] moistydank: it just needs to not die so fast lol
[3:29:26] asloff: yeah give every class everything right? xarDownbad
[3:29:27] moistydank: and an ms too would be nice lol
[3:29:27] TimmyShoes: i feel like enhance hasn't been good in years too
[3:29:29] matt_caste: I loved enh in the past but i don't like the rotation now, it just feels super awkward
[3:29:36] R1_Prototype: I caved and decided to level a demon hunter and in greens I‚Äôm just casually doing 120 to 150k dps.
[3:29:38] illEvan11_11: a MS would def go enh pretty solid
[3:29:45] matt_caste: basically swapped ele and didn't look back
[3:29:47] illEvan11_11: do*
[3:30:13] harvey_meadowlark: WOW the damage marks hunter puts out in such a short period of time is wild wtf
[3:30:15] kriegsy: Whats up king
[3:30:17] matt_caste: But when the wheel demands a sacrifice you have to obey
[3:30:19] TimmyShoes: don't forget to drop your own healing tide
[3:30:30] Reaperz_kinetic: @Th3s1c0n3 lmfao true kids are different i dont have any yet. Its surprisingly EXTREMELY durable if you get some good quality stuff.
[3:30:43] dinkleminkle: is Demo lock any good or is troll lads
[3:30:56] idiotferaltko: how are mages on retail atm?
[3:31:15] dinkleminkle: broken as usual what question is that
[3:31:19] reaper_oh: hows enhance feel? i love shammy
[3:31:23] RSN_Thicc_Dylf: i did a move with 4mil in granite and quartz for a 45mil house with 3 kitchens and they didnt know the cleaning crew was there for the post install. about 3-4 weeks later we were in there moving the same stuff out and putting in the same *new* stuff. they did the cleaning that time.
[3:31:28] cannabiotics: lmao
[3:31:30] markaimfire_: mages stay safe

[3:31:47] anmusallam: hello pikaman how are you
[3:31:50] Reaperz_kinetic: @RSN_Thicc_Dylf oof thats fucked
[3:31:54] dinkleminkle: man has to use whole toolkit to get the dub
[3:31:58] R1_Prototype: marks hunter is actually good if you play the salvo, explosive, sniper, arcane shot. seriously killing people in 4 globals
[3:31:58] TimmyShoes: @Sassper not quite ele levels but yes lmao
[3:32:37] Aro725: @TimmyShoes wtf how many times can you press lava burst lol. Im pretty sure enhance is one of the highest apms in the game
[3:32:47] nodramajustpizzaa: HUH
[3:32:48] Aro725: at least in pve*
[3:32:49] kriegsy: clip that
[3:32:51] reallyeric: HUH
[3:32:56] ImPlutooo: HUH
[3:33:13] TimmyShoes: @Aro725 ele is probably the most apm in the game right now for arena. instant cast lava bursts from flame shock
[3:33:27] hotsjkpurge: HOLY SHIT NO WAY we back on enh
[3:33:30] hotsjkpurge: BASED
[3:34:16] barret784: how so? does enh have less gcd or lots of attacks off gcd
[3:34:17] danieltsmoke: yo is ed still the editor?
[3:34:25] RSN_Thicc_Dylf: @Reaperz_kinetic a little. but i made 2500$ per trip so i wont complain. and that was just for the granite and stuff. not including their possessions which made each guy another 4k in tips alone. Great family but they were limited in the common sense department
[3:34:44] hotsjkpurge: static
[3:34:45] hotsjkpurge: bis
[3:34:45] clayyplayys: whats goodie gansta! Happy thursday
[3:34:45] sherkan0: DAY 90 waiting bikini stream

[3:34:53] Synystor: yeah, cs totem for sure
[3:35:02] R1_Prototype: counterstrike if you‚Äôre getting trained 100%
[3:35:14] R1_Prototype: they NEVER notice
[3:35:18] CatnipEvergreen: don't have anybody to really share this with but I finally conquered my solo shuffle anxiety as healer and had a great fun first game, went 4/2
[3:35:22] Aro725: @TimmyShoes Yeah but if you dont have procs you dont do anything. Enhance always has something to press. I know you get a lot of procs. But still dont think its close to like enhance or fury war.
[3:35:34] danieltsmoke: I really need to know this totem addon hes using..
[3:35:37] danieltsmoke: anyone know what it is?
[3:35:37] Jervun: locks should not be allowed to solo shuffle
[3:35:38] Reaperz_kinetic: @RSN_Thicc_Dylf LMFAO that last sentence was great. but yeah i would not complain about that kinda pay day
[3:35:44] CatnipEvergreen: @danieltsmoke its a weak aura
[3:35:57] UnmasteredPvP: hell yeah @CatnipEvergreen ! Keep it up!
[3:35:59] kriegsy: Weak aura for weak player
[3:36:00] danieltsmoke: dude weakauras just perma lui error on me

[3:36:23] Aro725: @TimmyShoes https://www.simulationcraft.org/reports/T29_Raid.html scroll down to action per minute
[3:36:24] CatnipEvergreen: @UnmasteredPvP it's pretty pog and its honestly more fun than Blitz, tho I still enjoy blitz
[3:36:30] ostreidiis: @kriegsy truee
[3:36:47] sherkan0: that totem aura is crazy

[3:37:29] kriegsy: this stream has ENHANCED my day
[3:37:42] UnmasteredPvP: Yeah that's awesome. I understand the anxiety bit, but glad you were able to push past
[3:37:45] RSN_Thicc_Dylf: @Reaperz_kinetic yeah hauling all that weight so much being as tall as i am puts a lot on my back and knees. went a bit too hard and landed a heart attack at 20y/o
[3:37:51] Phobikinesis: #nerf counterstrike totem
[3:37:51] TimmyShoes: @Aro725 this is showing raid dps, not action per minute. we need apm chart for arena
[3:37:55] Synystor: LOL, basically killed himself
[3:37:56] BMaStream: If you time Counterstrike well enough it's gonna lawyas pump

[3:41:02] Justinky1: @Pikabooirl WW or Arms better for solo shuffle?
[3:41:04] RSN_Thicc_Dylf: @Reaperz_kinetic ikr, and my neck is what broke my fall. I was initially supposed to be paralysed for life, now im  just dealign with a bad memory, shaky hands, and chronic nerve pain
[3:41:10] Blitzylive: bro why are you a panda
[3:41:11] Aro725: @TimmyShoes Yeah you're right, logs definitely lie. Maybe you just dont push your buttons enough.
[3:41:17] sherkan0: nice green ring bro

[3:41:36] Zenfuzz: outlaw GUIDE my guy
[3:41:43] TimmyShoes: @Aro725 i'm not saying the logs are lying, i'm saying raid logs from a year ago aren't relevant to answering a question in arena now.
[3:41:52] scrublin315: panda incap into fear
[3:41:53] notdxsty: sub goal to fix inventory??

[3:42:17] Reaperz_kinetic: @RSN_Thicc_Dylf damn thats rough i hope you heal up and get better fr but id take all that over paralysis for life.
[3:42:22] meactv: does pika have essentially every class fully geared?
[3:42:34] Clush___: would a pvp and pve guild for outlaw even be different
[3:42:39] Clush___: guide*
[3:42:40] TimmyShoes: @Aro725 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Up-Ki2iQ2W4
[3:42:43] bazistour: Pika you should really think about having kids, you would be a great father for sure
[3:42:47] RSN_Thicc_Dylf: going from 6'8 380lbs to 4foot somethign and 300 hits the ego like a truck lmao
[3:42:52] Justinky1: can someone with a spanish username that pika wants to say aloud ask my question for me?
[3:42:55] RSN_Thicc_Dylf: @Reaperz_kinetic
[3:42:55] Zenfuzz: not a bad lobby all together
[3:42:57] Aro725: @TimmyShoes You said apm. Thinking ele has any sort of high apm is wild. And you said I main ret and it puts it over ele and enh and that def aint true. So thats not saying its lying?
[3:43:17] barret784: 3-3 prediction
[3:43:27] Aro725: I see why you think its high apm, all good. I understand where you're coming from now.
[3:43:45] Zenfuzz: PI on DK
[3:43:47] RSN_Thicc_Dylf: @Reaperz_kinetic im already about 250% PAST WHAT THE DOCTORS GAVE ME INITIALLY BUT ILL SLOWLY GO BACK TO BEING PARALYZED

[3:44:01] Clush___: pi is broken on unholy
[3:44:10] RSN_Thicc_Dylf: @Reaperz_kinetic oops caps
[3:44:26] TimmyShoes: @Aro725 idk why your getting pressed brother, i'm just saying the info you're looking at tracks APM from a raid, from over a year ago. that isn't relevant to which class is higher APM in arena. really simple to figure this out, go watch the pika vid i just linked. he used an apm tracker while playing ele and it's literally 12x what your raid chart says.
[3:44:28] Reaperz_kinetic: @RSN_Thicc_Dylf daaaaaamn man that sucks wtf i didnt even know that was possible to "relapse" into paralysis
[3:44:56] pr0x365: See how OP that is
[3:45:05] reallyeric: no fucking way akira toriyama is dead???!!! i just heard this thru this stream
[3:45:08] RSN_Thicc_Dylf: @Reaperz_kinetic wlwasy wanted to play but when i was younger my temper was too bad, got banned form playing in school and my anger was too much for MMA so sumo was my thing
[3:45:09] reallyeric: im crying
[3:45:23] kklinker: kklinker subscribed at Tier 3. They've subscribed for 46 months, currently on a 46 month streak! <3
[3:45:25] LihizzXD: Zugzugs cant kick

[3:45:35] itschen: that dh is bot
[3:45:38] c3relki11er: looked like me out there
[3:45:53] takhsick: r1 healer inc
[3:45:55] RSN_Thicc_Dylf: @Reaperz_kinetic the nerve damage and my body aging will slowly bring it back or i could just go to the long nap at any time
[3:46:14] Reaperz_kinetic: @RSN_Thicc_Dylf damn you shouldve gotten into boxing or UFC you wouldve been a killer. sumo is crazy tho dudes are huge. im 6'1 200 and even id get crushed by those guys
[3:46:23] RSN_Thicc_Dylf: @Reaperz_kinetic so im making the time i have with my son the most that i can despite his young age
[3:46:36] Aro725: @TimmyShoes My bad, not worth getting into with you. You cant even work a website i wouldn't expect you to understand. If you think you press more buttons faster running around in arena(with downtime) than you would standing still hitting a patchwork target never moving thats wild.
[3:47:02] Reaperz_kinetic: @RSN_Thicc_Dylf shit im sorry brotha. 100% gotta enjoy every second you have with him thatll give you strength you never even knew you had
[3:47:09] Clush___: ur chat is writing entire paragraphs to eachother wtf is going on
[3:47:09] RSN_Thicc_Dylf: @Reaperz_kinetic i loved sumo, and you would be surprised how many guys your size beat me because of skill and their leverage advantage
[3:47:23] bobbyband0: 1
[3:47:44] barret784: isnt wow 1 attack per gcd

[3:48:30] prolyphicttv: gotta love DH meta amiright
[3:48:31] Reaperz_kinetic: @RSN_Thicc_Dylf damn thats interesting. Ive watched some before a lot of people think its just big dudes going crazy but the amount of technique is kinda wild
[3:48:34] JSaucy_v1: man, DK seems like it's made of paper huh?
[3:48:39] barret784: @ashraf_ma right so where is the apm from
[3:48:49] Zenfuzz: lol mage with 2 kicks

[3:48:52] Skoorbals: why is unholy so squishy
[3:48:57] itsjalin: PERM THURSDAYS LETS GO
[3:48:57] stuttersx: healer diff
[3:49:02] RSN_Thicc_Dylf: @Reaperz_kinetic and boxing and ufc was out of the window. when you blackout rage everytime your face gets hit and 3 for 3 fights you hospitalize people its just not for you. im sure the shoiw would be great but i couldnt allow myself to hurt people not out of fun for the sport
[3:49:02] Suchacrisis: looks like my disc games
[3:49:10] swiftypickles: Is your team CCing?
[3:49:14] Zenfuzz: panda then fear?
[3:49:15] Suchacrisis: priest is trash man hate to say it
[3:49:21] watkinscj: heal the team attack the enemy avoid cc
[3:49:24] itschen: I think your team need to cc moren
[3:49:42] HouseOnFire: what are we listening to
[3:49:52] Reaperz_kinetic: @RSN_Thicc_Dylf fair enough. Honestly for someone who would get that angry you had a lot of maturity to realize you didnt wanna do that to people
[3:49:54] TimmyShoes: @RSN_Thicc_Dylf are  you using the "i just see red bro" card?
[3:49:55] RSN_Thicc_Dylf: @Reaperz_kinetic yeah technique is truely king and you can tell who takes training seriously. Sumo is what i miss most honestly
[3:49:56] Clush___: @HouseOnFire beethoven
[3:49:58] Impbloody: Deadmau5
[3:50:01] bigbrownguy: dead mouse
[3:50:12] Clush___: slipknot
[3:50:34] Zenfuzz: legit no one taking damage
[3:51:07] RSN_Thicc_Dylf: @TimmyShoes not red, i would genuinely black out and nothing was holding me back or stopping me until i came to our was calmed down (idk how they calmed me)
[3:51:31] Reaperz_kinetic: @RSN_Thicc_Dylf i mean it may not get the recognition but its like any sport. Some people do it their entire life and the technique at the highest level is very noticeable. for big dudes they have crazy body control
[3:51:38] Fourofdiamonds1: whats the name of this song? so chill
[3:51:50] larrydavidtherogue: nice grip
[3:51:54] ghostflycowboy: @Fourofdiamonds1 feelsbirthdayman

[3:53:40] RSN_Thicc_Dylf: @Reaperz_kinetic i was 2 or 3 months away from having all my money saved up for my trip to live in japan and gop train at legit sumo stables
[3:53:41] TimmyShoes: @RSN_Thicc_Dylf this is a meme amongst pro fighters. they laugh at guys who say this "i can't i just black out" stuff.
[3:54:22] Jervun: Mau5 Mau5 Mau5 Mau5 Mau5
[3:54:39] Reaperz_kinetic: @RSN_Thicc_Dylf damn that wouldve been such an incredible opportunity
[3:54:52] RSN_Thicc_Dylf: @TimmyShoes when its an actual issue and idk how to stop or train myself its for the better that I stopped. i found morew of a love for sumo anyway
