[5:54:30] Circa4k: OMEGALUL
[5:54:30] hooomanoid: just 200m pistol shots
[5:54:32] rRedset: @Pilotgamer_ theres actually less in trios
[5:54:32] Rebmahc: Man, awesome as ever. But also evidence why Cross-play with PS5 players is just not workable for them. They can't complete with Keyboard and Mouse players, it's just not fair on them and should never have been included for them.
[5:54:34] nikosspan: imagine peaking shroud LUL
[5:54:36] Duphalac: %95 jumping %5 action
[5:54:43] HydratedThinker: @Pilotgamer_ because 2s is the new mode

[5:55:11] BigManAsad: this game has like no players late night cant get duo games and me and my boy get in the same solos without even trying
[5:55:13] machriphi: @Saintjackpot No, this is just a BR but it's based on the universe of Vampire: The Masquerade which is a tabletop RPG that's 30+ years old so that's where you'd find the lore.
[5:55:18] Tuestudo_: @Pilotgamer_ new mode as in meta?
[5:55:22] mattlull: That skin is sick
[5:55:23] lloyd_surges: what does his E ability do???
[5:55:24] SycharTV: @Saintjackpot The game takes place in the same universe as one of the best TTRPGs of all time, and one of the best RPGs on steam. So by extension, yes. This game itself, it has story elements and quests but it's not as rich as an RPG
[5:55:28] VLLN: I keep seeing people compare this to gunz but its nothing like gunz...
[5:55:28] AC1D444: No such thing as peaking shroud as you are already dead by that point
[5:55:35] Drunkpython: @pennylol_ This skin is called kuroshiro. it came in the shop during early access. I didn't buy it the first time and I need it now haha
[5:55:36] BigManAsad: @machriphi thats actually sick was wondering why there was so much lore
[5:55:37] sinofrost: how many games has he won ?
[5:55:40] Tnargav: @Rebmahc They have aim assist so they can try they best I suppose.
[5:55:46] yozou0: !mouse
