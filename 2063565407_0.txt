[2:58:07] kidontheesticks: when playing enhancement what do you want to buff your weapons with? wf/wf or wf/rockbiter?
[2:58:19] ekunx: that's lava burst in sod? lmao
[2:58:35] CerealKiller_HS_: I play druid balance and don’t get this buff. Completely illogical. However they need to repair the eclipse rune @lmgd1
[2:58:35] lowlay0: is mage good Kappa
[2:58:52] eXTreMe1337: that was the point
[2:59:02] Hawkzer: @CerealKiller_HS_ they did
[2:59:09] ama__deus: @CerealKiller_HS_ do you mean because of the pushback?
[2:59:23] CerealKiller_HS_: ohhhh really?! when did they do that?
[2:59:33] ama__deus: Last night iirc
[2:59:36] 0luja: i don't get why blizzard loves Lava lash so much, the spell sucks
[2:59:37] CerealKiller_HS_: played like yesterday and still was bugging (yes pushback)
[2:59:44] CerealKiller_HS_: niiice thanks 🙏
[3:00:17] ekunx: @0luja it's just to not buff 2h
[3:00:40] 0luja: i understand they don't want to make 2h op, but for DW lava lash sux
[3:00:53] 0luja: why would you use lava lash with flametongue instead of rockbiter on OH for extra atp?
[3:00:59] peeweeherman69: kinda lame if hes only one with agm
[3:01:02] ekunx: that's why they're buffing it
[3:01:02] SIaPz: do you mind showing your gear?
[3:01:03] 0luja: rockbiter would buff your MH
[3:01:13] Bamoose: Is there another stream hosting tournament?
[3:01:13] eXTreMe1337: boomies also get free 70% spellpushback with that rune which is so op, compared to other classes/speccs who cant get or have to use 2-5 talentpoints for that

[4:04:37] baazl91: hey, did anyone play dual rockbiter with way of earth in the duel? how is that performing in pvp you think?
[4:04:46] earlyseasoneric: ele/enh hybrid seems best ye but good luck getting random shaman who has somewhat enhance setup to play like a good ele and not just run in and die SMOrc
[4:04:49] Jigidog: PvP ty ty!
[4:05:09] flowen001: wow lots of nice info here
[4:05:23] Jigidog: Man this channel is amazing, just straight info without bullshit
[4:05:42] mickiholk: is the pvp trinket only reward? No pve items like phase 1?
[4:05:46] slay230181: I regret leveling my warrior 40 first
[4:05:49] doctorsupra: have you faced any shockadins yet? trying to gear mine, but doesnt get online untill some gear
[4:06:06] grimd0g: Hows 2h enha in pvp compared to DW?
[4:06:23] toxicdesty: @Lmgd1 what do you think would be a good solution to ele fix?
[4:06:27] radassbadass69: I think warrs will go higher, I don't trust sims tbh
[4:07:46] typer___iban: Hmm
[4:07:55] Pndaa69: u already are
[4:07:58] Pndaa69: KEKL
[4:08:00] RoxxorLG: 4th best with double pi from 2 priest + innervate on every boss
[4:08:05] RoxxorLG: so LUL
[4:08:06] typer___iban: LETHIMSCHIZO
[4:08:07] VanidarD: all I want them to do is normalize armor values of bosses
[4:08:20] hommesoja_no_jutsu: KEKG
[4:08:49] hommesoja_no_jutsu: lava burst is 30yd
[4:08:54] hommesoja_no_jutsu: KEKG
[4:09:22] toxicdesty: mean i would personaly say Flame shock with longer range and longer dot duration ?
[4:09:42] icnivadoelx: instant lava burst, dream on buddy
[4:09:45] mumleon_: Best solution is to modify spells in pvp combat, its already a thing in retail, they know how to program it. Solves every issue you can imagine right now  idk why argue pvp/pve balance if you can just do that?
[4:09:50] typer___iban: KEKW
[4:09:54] Wullull: adding so many instant high damage nukes is such a massive mistake
[4:09:59] deeptechgames: how about no global cd for flameshock
[4:10:01] hommesoja_no_jutsu: just add 100% spell pushback protection
[4:10:05] Balkidar: still dont understand why they dont allow it like in later xpacs where you only need to have the flame shock on the target right before the burst hit
[4:10:20] typer___iban: ele doesn't need what busted classes have, busted classes need to be reigned in
[4:10:23] hommesoja_no_jutsu: add 2 charges to flame shock, increase duration by 200% and range by 100%
[4:11:05] hommesoja_no_jutsu: yeah I said that to aggrend
[4:11:10] hommesoja_no_jutsu: its stupid
[4:11:29] peel2g: the shaman class design team is just absolutely clueless.. almost nothing makes sense yet on any specc
[4:11:34] iNSANEono: just make flameshock oneshot anything to line up with other popular specs
[4:11:37] RoxxorLG: you can put on overload rune just buff flameshock by 10y range or 16 and lavaburst by 6
[4:12:00] typer___iban: so what should power surge be changed to if lava is just instant?
[4:12:07] hommesoja_no_jutsu: @RoxxorLG no what u need to put is in lava burst rune " lava burst benefits from same talents as lightning bolt spell"
[4:12:09] tedi95: @Lmgd1 the issue is the devs play alliance, they will never give quality changes to shamans...
[4:12:09] Dancheek: root totem?
[4:12:16] hommesoja_no_jutsu: and add flame shock range increase to power surge
[4:12:40] hommesoja_no_jutsu: Also add elemental protection totem revelation
[4:12:41] rullehjem: YEP
[4:13:22] Dancheek: yea thats what I was thinking lol
[4:13:23] RoxxorLG: KEKW
[4:13:25] Dancheek: move earthbind
[4:13:47] hommesoja_no_jutsu: add lightning lasso @Lmgd1
[4:13:48] tedi95: what about adding NS effect to ele mastery like in wotlk?
[4:13:56] hommesoja_no_jutsu: what do you think of that?
[4:14:04] toxicdesty: i personally think we need a rune for pushback
[4:14:08] Jigidog: Yeah and lava burst can be countered if flame shock gets dispelled GG
[4:14:16] Jigidog: So it has counterplay
[4:14:16] unrealsiv: remove pushback from the game
[4:14:25] pint_of_milf: need clearcast for instant lava burst and healing wave
[4:14:29] mumleon_: add precog to classic  from retail YEP
[4:14:44] ch0wder92: just run earthshield Kappa
[4:14:59] Hyrionz: @lmgd1 best one ench have, faster wolf
[4:15:11] repsoni: flame shock range is something
[4:15:14] live_free_p: play elehance :)
[4:15:28] toxicdesty: why not just add a rune for pushback protection
[4:15:30] hommesoja_no_jutsu: they can
[4:15:34] peel2g: the could make it 20% but not reset the cd on it
[4:15:35] toxicdesty: pve would not need this
[4:15:35] hommesoja_no_jutsu: they made redirect work only in pve
[4:15:38] hommesoja_no_jutsu: so they can do that
[4:15:39] peel2g: just to have it insta cast more
[4:15:43] toxicdesty: but pvp would benefit from it massively
[4:15:47] brodude2000: buffing range should have minor to no impact on pve, so no reason to not add it
[4:15:54] hommesoja_no_jutsu: I play shaman and I mostly agree
[4:15:58] toxicdesty: i play shammy ele KEK
[4:15:59] hommesoja_no_jutsu: except about lava burst instant
[4:15:59] Dancheek: I was about to level my shaman :(
[4:16:04] 0hj0hnny: not sure if they would pump harder then mages or locks even with 20% on lvl 60
[4:16:07] Dancheek: shaman was the most fun I had in phase 1
[4:16:09] Jigidog: Wait what? Where are you takin those stats from?
[4:16:11] loves_a_beug: Ele gang
[4:16:17] tedi95: ele gang rise up
[4:16:22] Carepai: LOW T
[4:16:23] peel2g: shaman also was played bcz it was a good tank lol ... would be 4k if they sucked at tanking also

[4:22:48] VanidarD: why dont they just nerf warrior again? I think there might still be some runes left, that havent been nerfed yet
[4:23:22] radassbadass69: @VanidarD make consumed 15% and raging blow unnerf, they arent even in contention for use right now
[4:23:34] 0dicul: do u like melee hunters?
[4:24:08] VanidarD: @VanidarD nah, why dont they just nerf flaggelation to 10 % and take heroic strike and bloodthirst away from blood surge proc conditions
[4:24:37] qiip_fabi: BASED
[4:24:45] VanidarD: if aggrend was alone, he would do this btw
[4:24:54] fluxxtee: the girl dev w the accent is glad
[4:24:57] Duhski: the thing is, for PvPE, boomkin is literal garbage
[4:24:58] VanidarD: he hates all warrior players

[4:25:50] leetsu1: @grimd0g dont worry, they dont crit that much with starfire
[4:26:04] Carepai: wrong- ench sham can beat warrior :P
[4:26:23] Duhski: i just ran around starfiring mobs, youll be pleased to know i crit twice in 31 casts
[4:26:29] radassbadass69: at this level warriors dont have enough crit% to randomly blow people up which is kind of their only win condition right now

[4:27:33] Duhski: yeah
[4:27:35] VanidarD: people who still think boomie is bad in pve, wake up, you are dreaming mate
[4:27:54] Duhski: priest needs an sw:death nerf, then its prob fine
[4:28:04] berni2031: u think flametonue on OH gonna be better then rockbiter now ?
[4:28:12] Duhski: fire mages in PvE are disgusting rn.. 1k dps burst

[4:29:26] Ranzorx: classic devs make retail devs look like gods
[4:29:49] Balkidar: The OH boost from the DW rune could be interesting though. combine that with the lava lash change. Maybe enough?
[4:29:54] revien_wotlk: They use Wf/wf
[4:29:58] RoxxorLG: spellhance in pve is maybe with double flametogue good with gear idk LUL
