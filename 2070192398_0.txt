[0:52:39] tvilk: weekly no leaver
[0:53:23] Dexzz: so have u found out if this week is playable yet?
[0:53:40] syngred1: the week is playable except a few keys
[0:53:45] syngred1: throne/everbloom is horrible
[0:54:07] Harleybane: for 99.2% of people every week is doable
[0:54:13] Dexzz: oof timer looks rough
[0:54:57] dimsy__: AINTNOWAY
[0:54:58] stillsuitstk: dedg
[0:55:04] darklydream: Thats a rough one
[0:55:07] syngred1: this is the worst tank i have seen at this raiderio score
[0:55:12] nikozree: team dead
[0:55:47] Echo_Esports: Yooo i yoinked a Staforge PC. Best choice of my life . Go yoink yours at: echogg.ly/starforge/Scripe
[0:56:45] syngred1: he didnt use fel dev for debuff xd  its not overlap but ye
[0:57:19] Harleybane: prob looked at timer and got stressed out
[0:57:23] Harleybane: trying to win some time
[0:57:27] surfon: tank was cooked abit, shouldn't die on that on fortified
[0:57:37] syngred1: happens
[0:57:54] syngred1: its because they prolly dont track spell cds on nameplates
[0:58:02] syngred1: so they just kick first 1 that comes through cuz its quick cast
[0:58:29] tvilk: i dont understand how the tank can't just deal with the mantles.. he has so many ways to deal with them without even using interrupt
[0:58:52] syngred1: dh tank can perma solo a confessor
[0:59:00] tvilk: dh tank can perma solo 2 confessors
[0:59:01] syngred1: kick>cage>fears>stun>silence
[0:59:02] tvilk: even 3
[0:59:13] syngred1: yeah its ez
[0:59:13] tvilk: yeah thats pugging for you bro
[0:59:16] tvilk: welcome to my life
[1:00:11] Harleybane: can ignore shield, its just a 30 KEKW
[1:01:06] tvilk: RAGEY where the fuck is mohaso
[1:01:10] nadgob93: @tvilk you know as a tank you have to live + you can get locked in a global right before the cast and then if the cast comes through your sigil will be 2late
[1:01:29] tvilk: @nadgob93 I play tank
[1:01:41] stillsuitstk: do you have 29 key? does your 30 key become 29? or you looking someone with the key
[1:01:50] tvilk: its not that hard to deal with a confessor
[1:01:51] Harleybane: @nadgob93 should have a weakaura of some sort that tracks the ICD on the mobs ability and just make sure to have that window open
[1:02:20] nadgob93: @Harleybane that doesn't matter xD...its easy to backseat is not that easy to execute in a high key..not every1 is naowh bois calm down
[1:02:27] thijsjuuhhhh: One keylevel is 100 score, so thats not very strange when you do 1 key lower
[1:02:36] thijsjuuhhhh: 112 to be exact
[1:02:41] tvilk: @nadgob93 yeah its hard interrupting 1 mob i get it
[1:03:06] Harleybane: @nadgob93 ik, im just saying there's always 2 sides of a coin. can't just look at it at the "oh its hard" way, gotta see the other part of handling it too
[1:03:36] nadgob93: cant win vs tw chat i guess KEKL
[1:04:08] tvilk: you're arguing that its okay for a tank not to interrupt a mob because he needs to stay alive
[1:04:10] tvilk: like what
[1:04:47] nadgob93: i didnt say its hard ij ust explained to you, you dont ALWAYS have the leisure to press any global at any point
[1:05:02] Harleybane: @tvilk *i don't need to stop for a pedestrian, i need to focus on my own survival*

[1:05:27] tvilk: ICANT
[1:05:27] kaverrr: I’m already done with this week. I cannot look at another Ret Paladin use Divine Storm on Dreadpetals in Everbloom and bolster all the prio targets.
[1:05:51] nadgob93: @tvilk you were talking about cage/sigils/stun not only stun, yes if its intrerupt sure but you don't rely only on that in your argument itself..like idk what to say
[1:06:33] stillsuitstk: momka shake

[2:28:04] stillsuitstk: SWAP ICE LANCE
[2:28:36] stillsuitstk: nice
[2:28:58] tvilk: im pretty sure it does
[2:29:15] stillsuitstk: it depends on how far you adn mob stand together
[2:29:17] tvilk: but then again I lost my 46 priest because i didnt understand how leash works so
[2:29:20] tvilk: take that as you will
[2:29:47] stillsuitstk: if you aggro the mob and stand still at the same place - mob will attack you, but if you run like 60 yd and stand still mob will go away
[2:30:09] tvilk: you were 44
[2:30:19] tvilk: or toscar was 44 and you were 43 maybe

[2:32:37] tussmack: yea its not solo just SF
[2:32:41] tvilk: Depends. The addon made it so you always had to be in the same zone and online at the same time
[2:32:53] tvilk: But official they haven't talked specifics yet
[2:33:38] tussmack: no im pretty sure you can grp to your hearts content but cant trade
[2:33:57] tvilk: yeah but i wanna be able to trade with my friends etc

[2:36:10] tvilk: yeah the addon allowed trading with your partner. But you chose that partner from the start and never ever lost your partner
[2:36:21] tvilk: I want some duo partner stuff but I dont think they will do
[2:36:58] tussmack: blizzard probably wanted to do something similar to that (picking a duo when you start) but might be too hard to enforce in the game
[2:37:19] tussmack: like solving it on a technical level
[2:37:25] tvilk: should be a lot easier for blizzard to enforce it since they wrote the code.. but I think it's just a hassle they don't want to deal with
[2:37:31] stillsuitstk: disable resetdxp?
[2:37:48] tussmack: yea its too much headache for them probably, my guess anyway
[2:38:02] tvilk: they want to release it as easy content with as little work put into it as possible

[4:40:06] lunatic1996: yeah its almost impossible to get into for newer people
[4:40:11] stillsuitstk: pvp is too complex in retail
[4:40:46] hoboranch: are u playing mage healer?
[4:41:13] stillsuitstk: well he does have 1 healing spell lol
[4:41:20] paraqxtv: game in general is way to complex for new players or players who dont want to/cant invest time into the game and its mechanics
[4:41:44] jackotheman1: maybe they want a super high skill ceiling for AWC, but makes game unhealthy
[4:42:20] bernieeee: welcome back champ
[4:42:30] hoboranch: mage is busted in sod wtf i can only pull 2 maybe 3 mobs at a time on my 29 spriest

[4:45:41] stillsuitstk: alwasy heard that about gta5 ban wave
[4:47:44] lunatic1996: yeah thats the worst thing with a auto system i think
[4:47:50] lunatic1996: when you dont have a proper person behind it to review the case etc
[4:47:59] jackotheman1: having both pvp and pve content makes it so difficult to balance well imo

[5:22:50] bernieeee: i think cath main hand+off hand is quite good but if you have the rod then it will be hard to replace
[5:23:30] bernieeee: the rod no
[5:23:46] bernieeee: there is a staff in gnome, also epic, i think it has a higher chance of dropping than the rod
