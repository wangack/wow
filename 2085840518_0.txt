[0:29:59] charlesrrr: most consistent gold farm ive found for priest is fishing stv
[0:31:46] charlesrrr: southern cost and then river up north, hit every pool you see, hope to get good stuff from chests, but tons of mageweave and potions for good g. and can get lucky with backpack or boes.
[0:32:09] charlesrrr: both
[0:32:15] Itrulia: Azsahara fishing is also pretty good gold. Getting the winter squid
[0:32:28] charlesrrr: i run that whole route
[0:32:47] charlesrrr: yeah that whole thing
[0:32:48] Itrulia: yep, they soon wont be dropping anymore and they will be the bis food for lv 50
[0:32:49] vladgrasu: it is very simple, you want iron or mithril trunks
[0:33:16] charlesrrr: mobs arent really close to shore can avoid easy

[0:41:09] Itrulia: pserver knowledge was helping me
[0:41:20] Sizer_13: ty :)
[0:41:33] bojji900: LMAO KEKW
[0:42:02] Itrulia: Gromsblood, Wintersquid, Solid Stone probably safest bets
[0:42:21] Itrulia: Solid Stone due to Sapper that we will get next phase
[0:42:51] Itrulia: Aszahara fishing
[0:43:04] bojji900: u stand in 1 spot
[0:43:04] 23rhz: tanaris
[0:43:11] 23rhz: or bay of storms
[0:43:23] bojji900: its in azshara on some islands there u can just afk fish
[0:43:24] 23rhz: no pools
[0:43:32] 23rhz: just fish
[0:43:37] 23rhz: is like 17% or something
[0:43:56] Itrulia: just water, pools are good for later on (elemental water) but thats not for a LOOONG time
[0:44:00] moppernyc: sorry i missed that, what do you fish in tanaris @23rhz ?
[0:44:49] 23rhz: wintersquid
[0:44:50] plsnojebait: duel for gold
[0:45:00] 23rhz: but i bet they will change the seasonal part on that in sod
[0:45:05] 23rhz: so maybe not a good investment
[0:45:13] 23rhz: its used to only be fished until april or something
[0:45:18] weyachi: golden pearl is 23g on lone wolf eu AH
[0:45:23] Itrulia: until 20th of march
[0:45:29] 23rhz: i bet they do
[0:45:37] 23rhz: u heared it here first :D
[0:45:41] bojji900: they are
[0:45:54] bojji900: my best gold tip would just go into uldaman and kill shit
[0:46:01] Itrulia: 12:00-18:00 server time is 30% drop rate of winter squid FYI
[0:46:06] plsnojebait: whats the weakaura for when inner fire is not active
[0:46:07] Ste_HS: they're 10g not 23g
[0:46:27] Ste_HS: on lone wolf eu
[0:46:40] DYME_blzn: 16g on Living Flame EU
[0:46:43] weyachi: no

[0:52:21] baylo: shadow is an L for pvp disc is still where its at
[0:53:45] Itrulia: what should i finish first... enhance or boomie
[0:54:05] Bennska: Ah next phase, when soul link warlocks get insta corruption and improved drain life SeemsGood
[0:54:12] Wolf_Monster: is boomie better than shadow?
[0:54:18] Itrulia: @Bennska and death coil :)
[0:54:48] Itrulia: and OTK makes another warlock pvp tourney right, right!?
[0:54:51] 23rhz: shadow will be as powerfull i guess
[0:54:57] 23rhz: mages maybe even crazier
[0:55:14] Nightbot: Secure your privacy with Surfshark! Enter coupon code hydra for an extra 3 months free at https://surfshark.deals/hydra
[0:56:23] Itrulia: Crit will get more plentyful on gear too, which makes shadow worse unless we get pandemic + VT
[0:56:31] Itrulia: pandemic was already teased though
[0:56:38] Awiia: how rogue looking for p3?
[0:57:45] bojji900: give me p4
[0:58:00] bojji900: i think sod will be hella fun p4
[0:58:43] Itrulia: P3 will be the most boring phase simply because only 10 more talent points imo
[0:58:48] Itrulia: and like 1 more spell rank of each
[0:59:27] Itrulia: I hope they will make a health phase, where they reshuffle rune slots etc.
[0:59:51] KussTV: I ran my first BFD as a non-caster last night and the first epic caster weapon I've ever seen dropped.  forever cursed
[1:00:04] bojji900: they need to make something cool like arena/Rbgs for p4 holy that would be insane
[1:00:14] Itrulia: yeah exactly
[1:00:18] Bennska: Will sunken be the raid in p3?
[1:00:37] Itrulia: according to datamines yes
[1:00:57] Bennska: Another underwater dang xD
[1:01:14] Itrulia: Temple got a raid id now thats a sequence of BFD -> Gnomer -> Temple
[1:01:14] FIREMAGZZ: they need to address the POWER CREEP, as soon as i hit 60 im gonna have AQ ready gear. i can skip 4 tiers of content on the rip. new players / casuals are gonna quick from being dumpstered too much
[1:01:29] FIREMAGZZ: *quit
[1:01:29] kult1010: will kungen make a comeback with p3 @bryan? :O
[1:02:07] kult1010: only kungen can save p3
[1:02:17] Itrulia: If you look up the definition of "washed  up" you will see a picture of Kungen
[1:02:19] FIREMAGZZ: arent they supposed to release a 20 man also?
[1:02:32] Itrulia: Tempel and MC are 20man
[1:02:39] FIREMAGZZ: omg so bad
[1:03:12] FIREMAGZZ: all they are doing at this point is time gating leveling and turning old dungeons into raids
[1:03:41] kult1010: @Itrulia how dare you UWot
[1:03:51] FiberZ_: what is crushing darkness on that scale trinket?
[1:03:55] FIREMAGZZ: what ever happened to new scarlet monastary raid , karahzan crypts or Hyjal?
[1:04:00] bojji900: imagine a 5v5 BG with capture the flag. smaller one than WSG. with rating
[1:04:29] FiberZ_: "protects from crushing darknes" what is crushing darkness?
[1:04:31] Itrulia: I would enjoy rbgs ngl
[1:04:35] Incredioh: You doing any cata?

[1:06:24] averageatbesttv: @chat how can i make a little gold consistently
[1:06:34] FIREMAGZZ: SP are strong but i feel like shamans are more OP
[1:07:14] MarkillerX: Hydra how do you get enemy player buffs to show up? I can't for the life of me get it going
[1:07:17] FIREMAGZZ: like you can be a brain dead asshat and still kill pro's as enhancment or ele. Shadow priest is good but if the shadow priest is brain dead, he will get ez calpped
[1:07:21] KussTV: I can buy all the silk for 2s if that helps
[1:07:33] MarkillerX: I have the addon wtf lol
[1:07:37] MarkillerX: Doesn't show
[1:07:52] MarkillerX: I'll try again

[2:06:01] Kreynz: does defense skill matter against players?
[2:06:39] PhilTheChill: max defense skill does matter
[2:06:58] PhilTheChill: max as in X/X+5
[2:07:07] PhilTheChill: I think X can be anything, the +5 matters
[2:07:17] TomDelinquent: is this a spotify playlist i could follow?
[2:07:24] Hydramist: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_xi_vOJvqc
[2:07:37] PhilTheChill: +5 defense on an item increases your chance to dodge parry etc, but the base value doesnt matter
[2:08:35] PhilTheChill: Well no, I'm just saying that your base defense is counted as 300 if you're 60 even if it isnt actually leveled to max
[2:08:50] Kreynz: i just pulled like 20 lvl 1 rats in the IF tram cause my mages defense was like 140 lol
[2:08:53] HideLemonsYo: 10 more, what a journey its been
[2:08:53] Kreynz: up to 197 now
[2:08:54] PhilTheChill: but if you wear an item with +5, that is when the stat actually comes into play if that makes sense
[2:09:05] gratzitko: @Hydramist dakkroth said ur fried for not playing imp VE lol
[2:09:15] gratzitko: oh i got an ad rip
[2:09:30] Sinostra: didn't you want to stop at 180 ?
[2:09:56] Kreynz: just level your dagger skill on trash next gnomer!
[2:09:58] HideLemonsYo: @gratzitko said its not good in solo combat/dueling. GOod for grp and blood moon tho
[2:10:10] Sinostra: are you going for the 200 unarmed after dagger ?
[2:10:22] shoniewow: hey @Hydramist my friend, i maining shadow but i think about 2nd pvp/pve char thats great? what u would say? and i like only caster. wl or balance or hunt?
[2:11:18] Kreynz: does getting wand skill to 200 matter much either?
[2:11:19] Sinostra: what do you need 200 daggers for anyways ?
[2:11:19] Kreynz: im at 193 lol
[2:11:24] HideLemonsYo: just 8 more
[2:12:05] flews7: R u sure that it is considered max
[2:12:06] shoniewow: get discconect u answer?
[2:12:32] flews7: All i know is Between the Eyes misses all the time if gun/bow not maxed
[2:12:41] PhilTheChill: check your ranged crit
[2:13:09] Kreynz: 4.8%
[2:13:13] Kreynz: so maybe it does matter
[2:13:15] Aspmann: What scary game will you play today good sir
[2:13:49] Kreynz: 31 agi
[2:13:52] TomDelinquent: 200!
[2:14:15] HideLemonsYo: bro got that tiktok patience
[2:14:18] Sinostra: what situation is it gonna matter in anyways ?
[2:14:29] Sinostra: not like your dps comes from your dagger
[2:14:40] PhilTheChill: get 199 so you can still make valid excuses when you don't get a crit in a duel when going for pushback
[2:14:57] PhilTheChill: excuse value outweighs the 1 wep skill imo
[2:15:04] F0RTEE: Is that a banished mob for leveling skill?
[2:15:19] Zaidixthereal: i know u since 15 years
[2:15:31] shoniewow: hey @Hydramist my friend, i maining shadow but i think about 2nd pvp/pve char thats great? what u would say? and i like only caster. wl or balance or hunt?

[2:16:44] Kreynz: the fresh 40 rng is real
[2:17:21] PhilTheChill: Are EU players dueling a lot outside SW / Org?
[2:17:29] Kreynz: i dont think so
[2:17:36] OldProtocol: yes it matters
[2:17:44] HideLemonsYo: think they changed it in wrath that it had to be a green mob
[2:17:59] Kreynz: i remember in tbc people use to farm some immune mob in blasted lands
