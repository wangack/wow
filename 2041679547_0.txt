[0:27:26] buttonzking: the small amount of cocaine they contained – along with caffeine originally sourced from kola nuts – provided the drink's "tonic" quality
[0:27:26] Tony__Caleb: When it was mixed by a  soda jerk from a fountain
[0:27:29] KusoTrevor: hence the name COCA Cola
[0:27:31] r_hanson: coco leaf was a part of the recipe

[1:14:52] aseoun: thats why they pick them
[1:14:53] Z3ND0G: Hope they give us SM
[1:14:54] pwn3r1: same imagine getting sunken temple raid on 50 that would be 3 worse dungeons in a row
[1:14:58] miloxz: never played it
[1:14:58] darvent: I always avoided gnomer and BFD at all cost
[1:14:59] tsetse2fly: @SONII I like that gnomer is BIG, but that's about it
[1:14:59] Z3ND0G: and being secretive about it
[1:15:01] wazza76: SM raid would be great!
[1:15:03] iPlayCuzFun: gnomer is nice when ppl can find the way
[1:15:07] Nightbot: instagram.com/Sonii // Twitter.com/Sonii // youtube.com/Sonii
[1:15:08] KonQel: well that is kinda stupid
[1:15:10] MacEleven: I love BRD tho
[1:15:11] Goated_Goods: Discovery
[1:15:12] xJ3KYLL: if they made SM a raid next phase, people would miss out on the leveling dungeons
[1:15:13] mart_york: don’t change what people like
[1:15:14] Noilane: you mean bfd
[1:15:16] Cosmic_Drifter: As a feral druid in 2019 classic, it was a necessary evil that I do not wish to ever revisit...
[1:15:16] azzy_dog: ZF raid could be fun
[1:15:16] tsetse2fly: 50
[1:15:18] oneclearshot: SM is 50
[1:15:19] cyabrotv: if horde dont get a portal to gnomer then theyre screwed
[1:15:20] KonQel: "you think you dont like em, but you do" typical blizz LUL
[1:15:25] Limp4ns: Yo Sonii hope ur good
[1:15:26] Nightbot: yo
[1:15:27] iconovshred: gnomer was pointless for horde
[1:15:27] MacEleven: did you mean BFD or BRD?
[1:15:30] tsetse2fly: @wazza76 SM raid is prob 50
[1:15:41] Noilane: brd is the tits
[1:15:42] jaredfrasas93: This is a good opportunity for them to make Gnomer cooler
[1:15:44] KonQel: Wait are they rly making SM for 50? What the fuck are we supose to farm for 40 then
[1:15:45] xJ3KYLL: I expect Sunken Temple or something stupid at 50
[1:15:48] Neko4all: no epix
[1:15:49] xJ3KYLL: not SM
[1:15:52] spike82q: leveling a char is just non existent m everyone just boosts 29 and runs SM
[1:15:56] Skrimij_: sw and org raid would be sick
[1:15:56] d2jayden: but sm would still need to be a dungeon next season so how would they do it
[1:15:57] MacEleven: I thought Kara Crypts are 50?
[1:15:58] KonQel: ah shiet SM is alot of content 30-40

[1:16:04] oneclearshot: Sunken Temple could have been a cool 50 raid
[1:16:17] rawlexdota: isnt BRD the goat dungeon in classic
[1:16:18] tsetse2fly: @MacEleven It's prob the new 60 raid, SM the 50 raid
[1:16:19] pwn3r1: sunken temple raid sounds awful
[1:16:19] KonQel: @oneclearshot yeah i thought it would be ST
[1:16:21] devinx93: Sm won’t have raid but there will be a “scarlet “ raid me thinks at 60s probably in plague lands
[1:16:21] Mantoast_: you like dual wield better?
