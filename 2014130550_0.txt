[2:32:54] gooball_tv: I just hope Kyle Hamilton is ok man, he's been our unsung hero this year.
[2:33:09] volfan: Its Lamar's to lose now
[2:33:12] Nimz83: MVP should just be a QB award at this point, lol.
[2:33:12] Sollice: CmC

[2:37:07] gimmlay: he Carrie’s the team on his back… don’t have any receivers or te with mark andrews being out. we are on 3rd string rb too.
[2:37:39] Sollice: @gooball_tv I vote CmC but if Tyreek won I wouldn't be mad either

[3:14:44] Arauthor: i'm shocked after AR went down they're still doing well
[3:14:45] Sollice: Its a "game" meant to funnel money in to it to build new tech. That they can either sell off or wait for some big company to come in and buy them
[3:14:46] Colt_Engineer: YEAH SPORTS!
[3:14:52] Niksen_99: Do u think Ashes of creation will be better than New world
[3:14:52] Colt_Engineer: GO TEAM
[3:14:55] Colt_Engineer: GO SPORTS!
[3:14:57] maccaruso: Did you know half the teams in the league lost this week?
[3:15:03] Baldarsar: nothing will ever come close to WoW in long term, because you know what you got in WoW
[3:15:04] LimpyMcGee1: As an OU fan, im super happy for Baker atm.
[3:15:14] ic3k0ld: I can't believe people paid so much to get into Ashes alphas and betas
[3:15:19] Sh4nti: @Sollice +1 or just sell 'early access' copies
[3:15:27] Sollice: @LimpyMcGee1 Bucs ahgead in NFC South?

[3:16:05] soflotcg: its to the point its going to be dated now after alpha 2
[3:16:06] Sollice: AoC is going to run in to feature bloat
[3:16:13] Sollice: Because they want to throw in literally everything
[3:16:15] HaxzorJimDuggan: touchgoal!
[3:16:16] LimpyMcGee1: @Sollice yup, and i think they own the tiebreakers.
[3:16:25] Subbed_No_Ban: hand egg lol EU is out
[3:16:28] Bowwjack: @Towelliee i think the MMO that had the best shot to taking over was New World but the game has been and was released with a number of game breaking bugs even still now there are some.
[3:16:33] Niksen_99: Ashes of creation comes out and WoW will make a patch  and still smoke them
[3:16:37] shuey23: 60?
[3:16:42] Heyhowsitgoingtonight: @Colt_Engineer hater
[3:16:42] gold9871: 60+
[3:16:45] Truckjr72: 60*
[3:16:48] kimmo_gaming: 60 or 61 i think
[3:17:01] Sollice: New World was NEVER meant to take over WoW
[3:17:03] Sollice: ever
[3:17:51] im_capy: They just hope for a cut of the pie

[3:17:57] Osilon33: last game that should have rivaled wow was Wild Star... thats the last one i remember when it came out other than rift
[3:17:58] jetributions: Jetsun_401 subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 13 months! 
[3:18:02] Strange_Evil7: i miss rift
[3:18:04] ic3k0ld: Rift was good, it had bad timing
[3:18:06] Heyhowsitgoingtonight: no king rules forever
[3:18:09] Niksen_99: Even classic wow will beat any new new mmo KEKW
[3:18:12] merzicdh: it was funny for a while there every mmo was the "wow killer"
[3:18:16] Shrenko: @ic3k0ld you mean bad devs
[3:18:24] FoolMonty: that wasnt because of wow though, really liked rift
[3:18:33] snarkydonald: blizzard didn't think they would overtake EQ with wow either.
[3:18:40] ic3k0ld: @Shrenko no, I ment what I said
[3:18:41] FenrisFhaust: Man, Rift could have been great. I loved the macro / cast sequence system for rotations
[3:18:41] im_capy: wow has been around so long, it has seen muiltiple eras of "wow killers"
[3:18:55] Shrenko: @ic3k0ld they literally ruined the game though
[3:18:59] Respls: rift? didnt that come out around cata that poor game
[3:19:05] Veegore: rift was incredibly fun at launch just took too long to get end game out
[3:19:09] Clicklesly: WoW was the WoW killer Kappa
[3:19:35] wisperuna: @Towelliee rift was rly good but Blizzard opted to choke them out with scheduling top content with their relases

[3:19:56] Julinde: And FF14 plays differently than WoW so the two are hard to compare aside from population.

[3:20:06] Nessebr: I miss classic RIFT ): that game was so fun. WoW clone but that talent tree hit the spot
[3:20:17] Heyhowsitgoingtonight: top 5 for sure
[3:20:20] gooball_tv: I'm long term sweaty WoW/FFXIV player... WoW wins 9/10 times... FF is just better when it comes to community / things to do. WoW has less things to do, but it's more rewarding.
[3:20:33] FenrisFhaust: I'm old AF. I remeber using AOL dialup to play Ultima Online...
[3:20:34] aretho47: any chance of wow going to console?
[3:20:40] KaisenSiru: ESO Pog
[3:20:46] Niksen_99: Towel did you play Ultima Online? @Towelliee
[3:20:50] Julinde: I miss TERA though. I wish that game took off because the combat in that game was freaking awesome.
[3:20:52] Pharaoh_326: im a ESO enjoyer here and there
[3:21:00] Cooperharley0204: ESO goes crazy so good
[3:21:05] Elderpug27: UO was were it all started for me
[3:21:09] Cheapshoty0uth: FF14 graphic style hurts my eyes.
[3:21:09] Sollice: UO so nostalgic
[3:21:15] Elderpug27: then SWG took my childhood
[3:21:17] merzicdh: my first mmo was guild wars 1
[3:21:18] Niksen_99: UO had crazy PVP lmao
[3:21:21] FoolMonty: 12k avg pb ESO on steam
[3:21:22] gooball_tv: Dude FFXIV man... everytime I go back... I find hidden content I didn't know existed, it's wild af.
[3:21:31] KaisenSiru: SO much stuff to do in current WoW
[3:21:38] LimpyMcGee1: Wow put a sword in the ground, let it simmer with all the questions, and are just now getting around to it
[3:21:47] Respls: dude i dont even think i got through the rift tutorial
[3:22:03] king_julian_96: dawntrail next year aswell

[3:22:10] Nokterian: ffxiv has been in a long long content drought
[3:22:15] Cooperharley0204: @FoolMonty most people dont use steam for eso, they use the launcher and tons of console players too
[3:22:26] gooball_tv: FFXIV community bis though
[3:22:31] FoolMonty: true
[3:22:33] gooball_tv: Everyone is mega friendly and helpful it's awesome
[3:22:36] YoHizen: @Respls 73 players...140 24h peak for rift LOL
[3:22:43] nightpoker86: that doesnt look like a rogue
[3:23:08] cbiskit89: FFXIV also put a lot of work into implementing backwards feature. veteran players don't get much value from that kind of stuff
[3:23:20] anxietyrising: The patches have been icnredibly consistent for 14, the main issue is they split so much content in the patches
[3:23:29] gooball_tv: They do a lot of this  ^^
[3:23:30] ijuki: @gooball_tv lol, I do not where I played then... all I got was flame and toxic behavior FeelsBadMan
[3:23:31] Subbed_No_Ban: careful
[3:23:38] Ogerly: dedicated
[3:23:40] QuigsTV: @towelliee you do any keys this week?
[3:23:41] closetn00b: FF is very anti-data mining as well
[3:23:42] Nessebr: @YoHizen oh the game is super dead now. was a lot of fun 10-12 years ago though
[3:23:42] Pharaoh_326: dedicated
[3:23:42] nightpoker86: fanatical
[3:23:49] aretho47: they got high standards
[3:23:51] Cheapshoty0uth: FF14 players can't fathom that there are people who don't enjoy that game. I'm one of those people.
[3:23:58] Darthyrevan: Whos Joe?
[3:24:01] gooball_tv: @ijuki very rare! I've played both games way more than the avg player
[3:24:06] MoonwalkingAngel: a very cozy nice cult
[3:24:14] FoolMonty: is Pantheon still in development?
[3:24:15] BlewGamingGroup: FF doesnt like tourists
[3:24:16] SaDos: you know what drives me crazy about ff players? they dont want to be spoiled by watching a streamer play the story mode even though it is exactly the same as them playing it
[3:24:23] HaxzorJimDuggan: never go full quin on ff14
[3:24:32] gooball_tv: The RP is fucking amazing, I have a RL friend that I got into DJing the RP clubs... it's amazing how deep it goes
[3:24:33] Ezcotli: Wow is a way of life for some
[3:24:33] TheNoidd: don't confuse high standards with a high horse
[3:24:35] ijuki: @gooball_tv Me too? The experience is different for everyone it seems :)
[3:24:39] TuRDz__: FF is a straight CULT- they are weirdos
[3:24:49] king_julian_96: you goign to play dawntrailer next eyar when it comes out towelliee
[3:24:57] snarkydonald: Hale-Bopp! lol
[3:25:03] Heyhowsitgoingtonight: Weirdge
[3:25:03] Julinde: I'm not a wierdo either. Maybe don't hang out with the weird people?
[3:25:10] Cheapshoty0uth: You shouldn't have to play for 200 hours to get to "the good parts" of the story.
[3:25:14] Osilon33: wow players can be a straight cult too.. look at the people who knew EXACTLY was SOD was and still classic candy the shit outta it
[3:25:15] falldrgn: there are people that are just as passionate about WoW or any other games the 2K series for example.
[3:25:18] Julinde: Some of these people act as if WoW doesn't have these people too, lol.
[3:25:21] therealninjablade4: honestly i get what Towelliee is saying
[3:25:22] Sollice: @Cheapshoty0uth It's a Final Fantasy game...
[3:25:24] Niksen_99: Isnt there naked cat women with tails dancing in nightclubs in Final fantasy ?
[3:25:28] snarkydonald: if you don't know who your weird friend is.. you're the weird one.
[3:25:30] Osilon33: classic Andy*
[3:25:34] Sollice: If you dont want to get storied to death dont play FF lol
[3:25:35] nightpearl59: merry christmas and a good 2024
[3:25:38] akia03: and if your quin hide
[3:25:57] Julinde: Yeah, that's why WoW and FF can't be compared. Their end goals are very different from one another.
[3:26:07] therealninjablade4: i have a friend who shits on me for playing wow and telling me i should be playing final fantasy instead
[3:26:08] gooball_tv: Towelie you ever play FFXI back in the day? Probably one of my favorite MMOs I ever played. I tried to revisit it recently, and my brain couldn't comprehend the UI like it could when I was a kid.
[3:26:13] wonkabarss: u taking all mail and cloth on ur rogue bfd =P
[3:26:13] Warpiercer: FF players not going insane when their game take a mild criticism challange (impossible)
[3:26:14] Cheapshoty0uth: @sollice I have 214 hours played in FF14. I tried my best to brute force because everyone kept saying it got better. I was a black mage and I was bored to tears. Finally just gave up.
[3:26:24] roflpotamus: ff14 expac launches are arguably more fun than WoW ones for me now, shame it gets boring after a month
[3:26:29] HaxzorJimDuggan: gonna need to do the hildibrand storyline that started back in ARR to make your relic weapon
[3:26:40] dguap: morning, hammers up towHAMUP
[3:26:42] Julinde: @Warpiercer So, WoW doesn't have that either? I call massive bullshit.
[3:26:43] Moobot:  Help Towelliee reach the 1,000,000 followers goal. Click that heart button and join the Hammer Squad community!
[3:26:45] Bowwjack: @Towelliee I tried FF but i couldn't get into it the leveling seemed kinda tedious.
[3:26:45] Gungre: Towelliee, you should do the hildibrand quests in FFXIV for this expansions relic questline. All you need to do is just spend 1500 tomes after catching up(x3 right now for latest relic weapon).
[3:26:48] Relikk1: That's a good way to be.
[3:26:48] king_julian_96: dawntrail though seems much more lax apposed to what we got in endwalker
[3:26:51] Nokterian: FFXIV has rules indeed for MSQ
[3:26:53] Sollice: @Cheapshoty0uth Yeah I mean I get it. Every once in a while I want to go back to FF but having to do all of that story content I haven't done to get caught up is daunitn
[3:26:57] SaDos: @Towelliee thats called being a fucking child
[3:27:06] Warpiercer: @Julinde Are you even listening what Towellie is saying rn? xd
[3:27:11] bumpstock75: sharks smelling blood
[3:27:20] JQ47: Lol like max he got an hour long hate video.
[3:27:30] Moobot: No need to repeat yourself, @king_julian_96 (warning)
[3:27:32] gooball_tv: @Gungre every concert I go to now IRL, I make sure to do the hildibrand and humiliate myself at least once
[3:27:40] geokouts: you say bad things about WoW none bats an eye, you say something bad for FF and everyone loses their mind :P
[3:27:40] Moobot:  Towelliee.com has all of your Towelliee news WoW UI addon information, and merchandise collection. Check it out!
[3:27:43] Alaquane: he is not
[3:27:46] HaxzorJimDuggan: quin fucked up
[3:27:46] roflpotamus: not on stream
[3:27:48] Nokterian: KEKW
[3:27:54] snake_like: "blind run"
[3:28:02] Cheapshoty0uth: @sollice Also I'm not a big fan of the anime esque aesthetic. It's just not for me and that's OK. What I was pointing out is some FF14 players can't fathom that there are people who didn't enjoy the game lol.
[3:28:06] Nokterian: Quin fucked it up even more with his boosting
[3:28:31] Julinde: @Warpiercer  Are you? Tribalism is in both. Acting as if one is worse than the other is stupid.
[3:28:36] Sollice: Either way. BOTH communities are welcome in this channel. When he does play FF chat will be respectable.
[3:28:36] gooball_tv: Graphics update should be cool too
[3:28:37] Gungre: Yeah start of new story
[3:28:44] Niksen_99: Why are the finaly fantasy community like that ?
[3:28:48] Nokterian: yeah its the relax expansion by the looks of it
[3:28:51] wonkabarss: i never liked ff14 xmog really
[3:28:58] Julinde: I play both very heavily. But acting as if one is worse is obnoxious.
[3:28:58] HaxzorJimDuggan: post game endwalker has little to do with what happened in endwalker
[3:28:58] Alaquane: we freed twitter
[3:28:59] roflpotamus: the new melee dps looks wicked, also a caster dps to be announced soon
[3:29:03] gooball_tv: Does classic go down for maint too?
[3:29:04] wonkabarss: only the anima and eden weap
[3:29:10] Wcvechten: I just hate the glamour system in how it works
[3:29:14] gooball_tv: feelsbad
[3:29:16] Alaquane: A test of your reflexes!
[3:29:18] Nokterian: ffxiv glamour is end game
[3:29:19] gooball_tv: I have to actually work
[3:29:23] Osilon33: all 3 are going down for 30-60
[3:29:23] HoppsiDejsi: One quest after seeing @Towelliee doing them. and im one and done for the Winter veil armor
[3:29:24] Aidler: still hunting the christmas mod for the dragon
[3:29:25] polaropposite76: Toweliee a tmog whore? nah no way
[3:29:30] roflpotamus: PepeWhy
[3:29:34] Cheapshoty0uth: I'm glad people enjoy FF14. I wish I did because who wouldn't want more fun things to do.
[3:29:45] Wilson5521: What approx time for BFD raid?
[3:29:46] Warpiercer: @Julinde People have been talking about wows problems for years, even people straight up quitting the game. But appearently you can talk bad about FF. Because players tend to go crazy
[3:29:50] wonkabarss: u want my druid in your rogue bfd for wf i still need leather from there @Towelliee
[3:29:51] dalgress: what dragon?
[3:29:55] gooball_tv: what server / faction are you
[3:30:00] Julinde: @Cheapshoty0uth Some games just can't be enjoyed. It's ok. Plenty of other games to enjoy.
[3:30:04] deanbeo: Feral dps should hit 25 today also
[3:30:04] king_julian_96: um you fight golbez
[3:30:08] Niksen_99: Did you give PoE season a try ?
[3:30:11] roflpotamus: LMAO
[3:30:17] HaxzorJimDuggan: your paladin and warlock will not reset until tomorrow sense you ran on sunday
[3:30:26] Cheapshoty0uth: @julinde its almost like people have different tastes.
[3:30:29] Rudric_Ice: wow people fight each other whether its classic or modern imagine thinking WoW and FF not having a grudge against each other
[3:30:33] dguap: Hammer Squad is on Wild Growth?
[3:30:35] Niksen_99: Yeah alot of stuff to do
[3:30:39] Julinde: @Warpiercer There are loud mouths in every game. Again, stop acting as if WoW is different. WoW isn't terrible yet if you mention that, people go crazy saying Blizzard doesn't care.
[3:30:40] wonkabarss: no thery all reset tuesday @HaxzorJimDuggan
[3:30:41] Sollice: Yes @dguap
[3:30:43] TheUnknowing: yes @dguap
[3:30:54] dguap: ty <3
[3:30:56] king_julian_96: and you find out golbez's true identy
[3:31:01] Julinde: @Cheapshoty0uth I know, right? Crazy.
[3:31:16] HaxzorJimDuggan: @wonkabarss 3 day lockout dont work like that tuesday is irrelevent
[3:31:33] akia03: have you played baldur's gate 3?
[3:31:53] Aidler: the purge LUL
[3:32:10] Cheapshoty0uth: I play DnD irl every weekend so BG3 felt kind of redundant to me.
[3:32:31] roflpotamus: is it too early to go feast on some xmas lasagna leftovers
[3:32:47] Cheapshoty0uth: Like you said though great game.
[3:32:48] Nessebr: lmao running to the AH on a dino mount doesnt get much more muscle memory than that

[3:33:04] Warpiercer: @Julinde Yeah no. Players defended everyone and streamers when shadowlands content draught and systems fuck ups happened. But when streamers or anyone talks about FF problems, suddenly the vieverwaves and playerbase goes insane
[3:33:14] spankymcpie: I actually took the time to vault all 12 of my characters semi properly so hope I get at least a few good things. It’ll be satisfying at least
[3:33:23] gooball_tv: I just had some leftover breakfast souflet
[3:33:23] Nokterian: Seen the video of Sean and Elija playing BG3?
[3:33:24] gooball_tv: It was fire
[3:33:25] Sollice: @Julinde @Warpiercer You can go to privates please
[3:33:26] Digmadness: eating turkey now for bk lol

[3:33:40] beerking2323: did u have hangover today?
[3:33:45] Julinde: @Sollice I'm done, bro. No worries! I've said my piece.
[3:33:47] Rudric_Ice: someone has no life
[3:33:47] darshan10000: Hey bro, nice to meet you. Is it a good time to start WOW now? ill be a solo player for the most part and i love pvp, is pvp any good?
[3:33:48] Sollice: ty
[3:33:50] CrunkyBrewster: Oh i have a lot now
[3:33:51] H1D3F: no leftovers here. we usually unfreeze all the tamales we made for thanksgiving
[3:33:55] CrunkyBrewster: I have 40ish 70s
[3:34:03] x1mmortal_: i have 5

[3:34:10] bubbles1489: good morning. Hope your stream goes well
[3:34:13] devildriver1919: thats the 30-40's talking
[3:34:16] devildriver1919: right there
[3:34:16] Niksen_99: Im mostly just tired lol
[3:34:16] QuigsTV: I have 13 but a lot of them are very low keys
[3:34:22] roflpotamus: im 24 and felt that
[3:34:22] Wcvechten: He's turning into a real boomer FeelsStrongMan
[3:34:29] Sollice: @Towelliee I wish that worked for me. Tried and nothing
[3:34:30] spankymcpie: The afk xp thing is too op
[3:34:34] Mecabeast: i think towelclaus might have ran a few raid bosses on your alts so might have a few extra vaults today
[3:34:37] Rudric_Ice: u were chugging on doc's burbon
[3:34:44] R0t0kan: 1 more 25 to go and have all 8 horde side
[3:34:47] Cheapshoty0uth: Federal job = No THC Sadge

[3:34:58] roflpotamus: Kappa
[3:35:02] FoolMonty: all my alts are early 60's, have to say DF feels.. meh
[3:35:08] Rudric_Ice: oh true true
[3:35:14] Nokterian: @Towelliee you should watch frodo and sam playing BG3 its so funny https://youtu.be/YQdkEQ50cq8?si=qzbZvIuiecHlVmjv
[3:35:17] Julinde: @Cheapshoty0uth I'm hoping they over-turn that at some point. Virginia is kinda getting there.
[3:35:20] Heyhowsitgoingtonight: pepeMeltdown WOW IS OVER
[3:35:26] DeanoTV: @Nokterian that vid is so good
[3:35:28] Cheapshoty0uth: I'm not hungover in the traditional sense I'm just tired hungover.
[3:35:29] HaxzorJimDuggan: lucky he didn't take the bottle
[3:36:05] Cheapshoty0uth: @julinde I'm in Maryland. It's recreational here but I would lose my job if I pee dirty. Makes sense

[3:53:46] im_capy: It aint Canadian LUL, they celebrate it but it aint theirs
[3:53:46] athurston: For those of you who don't know, in Canada we celebrate Boxing Day which is the day after Christmas.  I think it started in the 1700s or so where everyone was so sick and tired of family and need to blow off steam.  Everyone would get together in their local boxing gym and just beat the living shit out of each other.  As families started to join in, it would often end up that you get paired with another family member which was ideal.  When these situations occurred it was generally accepted that
[3:53:47] Aidler: also a UK thing
[3:53:47] PadidinJones: Basically
[3:53:47] shapebender: black friday
[3:53:49] stallowned: ya its retail sales
[3:53:51] skrin001: its like black friday just after christmas
[3:53:53] Moobot: No need to repeat yourself, @Digmadness (warning)
[3:53:57] Ultratide_: "What is the origin of Boxing Day? Boxing Day, hailing from Victorian England, extends beyond the boxing sport association. Its nomenclature originated when the affluent boxed surplus items for the less fortunate. Servants, lauded for their toil, received 'special boxes' filled with treats."

[3:54:13] Sollice: It's celebrated by Canadians because Canada was a province of England for many years lol.
[3:54:26] athurston: regardless of who you were up against, you could totally and entirely try to destroy the other person as a form of self expression and release.  Your 90 year old Meemaw - kidney punches all round since you knew she was incontinent already.  7 year old nephew, head shots because you knew they already had trouble in grade 2 math.  As the holiday expanded, we no longer needed boxing gyms and would just hold these events in our houses, basements, strip clubs, parking lots, wherever.  It was actually

Anyways, I gotta go knock out my cousin who's in a wheelchair and then hopefully concuss my mother-in-law so that she sleeps until New Years eve.

[4:26:19] iWender: Are you tanking?
[4:26:22] Deafening_Noi5e: Gnomes were a mistake
[4:27:41] BlewGamingGroup: i thought they said that they were going to stop designing fights around addons a long time ago
[4:27:49] TheGiant99: I totally get it was just playing the other side of the coin

[4:29:52] trollinmyimp: @ThrottleJunkie Dude, it's so easy, like seriously, theres dozens of videos on how to use it
[4:30:00] Tac2cul: we picked up a pug mythic person on our realm, and they had never used WA's before, they left after trying to figure it out
[4:30:02] blijex: Luxthos WAs ftw!
[4:30:16] CardinalTX: When will AI be able to raid for me?
[4:30:41] DecayedmiNt: Same reason they dont default WA/boss mods. Why would they invest the time when it already exists?
[4:30:54] ThrottleJunkie: @trollinmyimp i tried... it is just a confusing process. and on top of that i would not even know what i was looking at even if i got it to work. lol
[4:31:01] Tormac1129: there's 2 in auberdine
[4:31:38] Sollice: Wow those were a couple of shitty vaults
[4:32:03] OGaxelaw: player balance is why they should do it
[4:32:20] CoraDeVine: anyone else having stream lag or is it just me?
[4:32:44] DecayedmiNt: Player balance? Little Jimmy will not interupt or not sit in fire with or without default addons
[4:32:48] Aidler: blizz should just buy weakauras
[4:32:52] m4x1gh: is it better to have Heroic items or go for higher gear score items?  I just started DK first time
[4:32:56] OGaxelaw: i dont even play with dbm its for handicapped players who dont pay attention and need help
[4:32:58] Cabbageman007: 10.2.5 date?  Jan16th?
[4:33:00] im_capy: Would love to see the top 5 addon devs be brought into the wow team if Blizz is gonna stick with addons
[4:33:07] Morpserie: @OGaxelaw wrong lol
[4:33:11] xhaven: weak auras and addons allow you to personalize your gameplay, otherwise you are completely dependant on the game company. People dont realize how great it is to have control over your mmo rather than to be dependt on the game company
[4:33:22] OGaxelaw: the player choses to use add ons not the game designer.
[4:33:50] Rudric_Ice: Ye remove add-ons
[4:34:13] Dudamnit: it will be a shit show of bugs
[4:34:29] Sollice: Do a two boss raid
[4:34:37] Sollice: So its like a bonus thing you can test on
[4:34:48] BlewGamingGroup: that just means that their devs and internal testing team would have to do more work . and you know that isnt going to happen
[4:34:55] killscripts: They would also have to hire beta testers
[4:35:13] infektyd: i like the thought max had for middle of droughts, them make a 1-2 boss raid on the tournament realms,no addons, no dungeon journal, just something like MDI and you get to watch everyone learn it out and actually compete without the support of $$ and gold..
[4:35:13] im_capy: Dont call it a raid, call it something else to "test" this out and then go from there

[4:35:18] Sollice: No I mean for testing no WA or DBM kind of thing
[4:35:35] TheUnknowing: you can keep saber slash i think
[4:35:38] infektyd: considering it doesnt take long for blizzard to actually make a boss, its the storyline and aesthetics that takes th elongest
[4:35:44] Alaquane: maybe for the naga lady add fight

[4:36:06] im_capy: LUL
[4:36:24] OGaxelaw: i think the only add on blizzard should incorporate is a damage/heal meter. a player should always know outputs
[4:36:29] infektyd: @im_capy there is a website for ironman only grey gear leveling and such.
[4:36:30] Rudric_Ice: No need to clear just logout near that wall
[4:36:42] Heyhowsitgoingtonight: thats why the pally didnt say 7/7 LUL
[4:37:09] OGaxelaw: everything else can easily be acccomplished with just more experience on fights you dont need weakauras you dont need dbm you can learn on your own eventually
[4:37:32] Alaquane: I see 2 hunters. should be fine
[4:37:48] im_capy: @im_capy Can you inturupt? Yes? ok your in
