[1:11:17] nalakane: Would you duel Payo for 10 000 irl money?
[1:11:43] nemsisgodx: @Whaazz The only thing i hate is that private servers existed, its like an unfair advantage is wish wotlk was new for everyone again would definetly feel like u progress with others

[1:12:53] Touchme_hc: except nobody plays it Sadge
[1:13:05] SickBanga: payoOmg dragonlands
[1:13:09] Thousandcuts: 10k games is really lowballing it for players that have played wrath for like 10y xD
[1:13:10] arenasheep: u got hair im bald unfair bro
[1:13:19] SebastiaNcoob: !talents

[1:14:30] nikzyyy: the 10 year meme is getting out of hand no single top player like mir/torsten played 10 consecutive years they played like 2
[1:14:38] dusttiy: GIGACHAD
[1:14:41] Hynan: whats your end goal on retail?
[1:14:42] nemsisgodx: @Whaazz But i guess its a little fun figuring out what to do in wotlk even if people have an advantage. But like the LFG restricted to server is just meh LFG should be cross server. the only reason it wasnt cross server back in the day is cuz they couldnt do it techwise. Sitting in LFG is horrible
[1:14:45] graundingg: tygalwYez tygalwZir
[1:15:02] tryedge005: whazz the alpha rogue
[1:15:04] mabbeCS: Pikaboo and Xaryu
[1:15:08] mabbeCS: are good examples
[1:15:09] hvmantv: @nikzyyy what do you talking about? Marm and Mehh played wrath on AT for literally 8 to 10 years
[1:15:12] dusttiy: i think its cuz of language barrier too
[1:15:20] dusttiy: to communicate with viewers
[1:15:26] oezixx: they are more chilled
[1:15:27] AliCrash: eu is more competitive ye
[1:15:30] smuga0: eu people are sweaty af
[1:15:31] nemsisgodx: @Whaazz Well who car about strems its about rating mens
[1:15:34] nikzyyy: @achinachi no they didnt play AT for 8-10 years AT didnt exist that long dont talk when u dont know shit
[1:15:46] hvmantv: they played both AT and Warmane
[1:15:47] Rayorlol: !BIS
[1:15:47] Moobot: @Rayorlol Season 5 Wrath PREBIS & BIS LIST is out on my Discord Server in the Subscriber-Perk-Channel ! https://discord.com/invite/bjumdu8qBW to join Discord
[1:15:48] ExcessiveXO: Some people only want to watch high rated games though, watching pikaboo do 1600 viewer 2s is resident
[1:15:56] hvmantv: Marm competed on AT from 2010 to 2013
[1:16:00] Juginator: Wir>Mir
[1:16:04] hvmantv: and won 80% of the turneys
[1:16:06] grris: whos best warrior?
[1:16:07] winnick__: Avizuraa
[1:16:11] hvmantv: you are clueless
[1:16:19] badvibes______: to be fair marm didnt even play for that long before he was really good
[1:16:47] arenasheep: avizura is best rogue atm or marm
[1:16:52] Antibrew: it shows how bad the priests are
[1:16:55] oezixx: oezixCatJAM oezixCatJAM oezixCatJAM
[1:16:57] smuga0: yea but if u put all those r1 wrath players in retail they wont even get glad first season LUL
[1:17:06] nemsisgodx: @Whaazz what addon makes ur spells glow when u press them?
[1:17:21] hvmantv: @okurwaax they will all get glads
[1:17:27] ekc1m: what's the unfair advantage? if you take for example CSGO, there are players who have played the game for 10 years, you can still get better than them if you put in the hours
[1:17:29] sapzrogue: It doesnt matter who is "best" you're all sick and have your own styles
[1:17:32] hvmantv: no r1, mb, but definetely glad
[1:17:32] badvibes______: @okurwaax alot of the top ladder retail players originaly came from wotlk private servers
[1:17:40] lmDivinee: Sup Whaazz are not gonna play retail until they buff the rogue?
[1:17:54] Thousandcuts: @ekc1m brah wow is not like cs....

[1:19:12] Thousandcuts: I don't think NA has that many private server players tho
[1:19:12] dusttiy: once a week
[1:19:12] no_way_: look the think is in my opionion, im the best rogue. Just no one knows it. So now you know it and you can accept it or not. But that wont change the fact that im the one and only xP
[1:19:15] hvmantv: Well Marm is multi r1 on priest/mage and rogue @whaazz it s kinda normal that he knows everything aboutbwhat they need to do
[1:19:30] Talenshiv: NA ladder it's a joke every 1600 player in Eu can get 2200 rating in Na
[1:20:12] asleeprmp: Does this "marm" guy stream? never seen him monkaW
[1:20:12] grris: MARM? BatChest
[1:20:27] leolleolle: No I don’t agree. I saw him playing and I thought he played really good
[1:20:29] viharx: MARMINATOR
[1:20:30] badvibes______: @asleeprmp has a youtube channel but streams very rarely
[1:20:38] Choppakabra: @whaazz Do u have link for Marms stream?

[1:22:08] katsoudasp: i doubt
[1:22:12] hanebuechen: BIG POINT!
[1:22:17] Babbub: ok relax man
[1:22:19] Babbub: pshero
[1:22:21] Thousandcuts: "best" is hard to quantify
[1:22:23] billrothx: Thats why you should compare teams not individual players
[1:22:23] smuga0: OMAGALUL
[1:22:26] AliCrash: True

[1:23:24] hanebuechen: i think there are playstiles, not one is the best, but u have one of the best for SURE! @Whaazz
[1:23:29] hvmantv: We can t even say best player = blizzcon champ, because other people s comp could be r3ally bad that xpansion
[1:23:29] asleeprmp: Johnny is #1 rogue player
[1:23:35] prodijftw0: What's Jimmy's stream ? @Whaazz
[1:23:37] dotbotter: thats called confirmation bias
[1:24:37] Aliinyo: yes but u have to keep in mind, ppl will continue to ask these questions because they value your opinion higher than some randy-andy.

[1:26:01] Secrafyse: @asleeprmp https://www.twitch.tv/Whaazz  here you go
[1:26:15] tryedge005: I loved reckful game play back in the days
[1:26:15] leolleolle: I’m havin naxx 25 man gear as rogue. I have all off pieces and dagger and still I’m struggling at 1200 rating
[1:26:18] asleeprmp: @Secrafyse thats not johnnys stream. Thats jimmys
[1:26:28] Secrafyse: aah my bad
[1:26:38] no_way_: na one retail its literly no difference. you can get 1600 with every gear. And the one who got the higher gear did the same already. So its not rly a difference if you need to hit a higher rating for better gear cuz everyoone needs to do this.
[1:26:49] Juginator: @leolleolle put shadow dance and ambush on your bars
[1:26:51] Lostt_xd: who is the all time wow goat would you say? I would say either kungen or schwifty
[1:26:53] Juginator: that should carry until 1600 at least
[1:27:18] no_way_: but in the new expansion  as i know you have direct the best ilvl in pvp
[1:27:34] hanebuechen: reckful for his time

[1:32:40] mabbeCS: What happened with my man Båten, too much lawyer stuff or what
[1:32:41] Thousandcuts: @tibaaahh nope, its complicated

[1:33:21] asleeprmp: @OGafriKEN yeye, im was just talking about pika not caring about retail/woltk really. He cares about his stream now, and not about being the best rogue
[1:33:34] afriKENx: yeah i know
[1:34:11] asleeprmp: @Whaazz what do you think about wallrik? 4Head
[1:34:13] afriKENx: EU KEKW

[2:01:26] jmoz1234: Sorry if this is loaded question. But I set a goal to get good in wotlk and aim for the tabards at least for the coming seasons. Sometimes feels overwhelmed on what to focus on learning. Should I focus on getting rotations and dmg to second nature almost, then focus on strats on comps etc..?
[2:01:29] tryedge005: is windfury still viable with rogue or the classic instant deadly

[5:16:02] kronm: IMO  , i could be wrong but you really need to stop wasting your energy with CC and just do braindead damage to pala. YOu lost the entire go becuase u were ccing rogue too much and he has no way to hit with with evasion out of stealth.
