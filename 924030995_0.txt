[0:18:11] Kauko13: uther doesn't know anduin

[0:44:39] flyingmachin3: yeah honored
[0:44:48] othraerir: then do heroic?
[0:45:14] Archiduss: TBC was really hardcore to be honest. More so than Classic with all the rep grinds, attunements, boss tuning and gearing.
[0:45:21] azzacopey: azzacopey subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 6 months! 
[0:45:31] Ensanee: cant wait for tbc to be hyped up so hard, and died in a month like classic

[0:48:39] BlueBeast33: There are some that require a key
[0:48:41] Juginator: @Ensanee I am not argue with you, you have already made up your mind
[0:48:50] Masqerader: some dungeons needed a key
[0:48:56] flyingmachin3: shattered halls arcatraz
[0:49:00] Masqerader: like Shadow Labs, Shattered halls
[0:49:08] Shrenko: are you lvling on classic today?
[0:49:14] falldrgn: oh man.. all that sweet sweet rep grinds again..
[0:49:14] BlueBeast33: You'll have 16 at launch, but will need a key to unlock like half of them
[0:49:28] flyingmachin3: yeah
[0:49:31] rhsiuol: thoughts on char boosts for bc?
[0:49:43] TweakT: BC login screen music sstvPOOPA
[0:49:43] sifer007: they gone fuck up im sure
[0:50:07] rhsiuol: at least its limited to 1
[0:50:10] BlueBeast33: I do find it weird how BC team could make so many dungeons, yet nowadays they struggle to make like half that
[0:50:29] theminerr_: why unfortunately?? so blizz cant make money anymore? @Towelliee
[0:50:46] TweakT: imagine creating all the vanilla dungeons too @BlueBeast33
[0:51:11] falconpunch_: so 50 characters daily farming the mount and didn't drop yet?
[0:51:22] Prayshock: @theminerr_ I think he was saying unfortch at the fact he didnt get love rocket this time
[0:51:50] Arckadius_90: No love Rocket this year :( well maybe next year
[0:51:51] Kromede: this is it
[0:52:26] Treeo83: all gear will be swapped out during the first levels in tbc content anyways for the boosted carracters if it adds more people to the servers it's all good

[0:53:13] osatox: good luck on the last day of love rocket @Towelliee
[0:53:34] TweakT: it's a gud idea to just play on a medium pop server, most people dont have 100k golds there
[0:53:40] flebbooo: oh no LULW
[0:53:40] rhsiuol: d-d-d-d-devastating
[0:53:48] Juginator: a lot of people were gonna buy gold to get dungeon boosted anyways so at least now they can directly pay blizzard
[0:54:02] falldrgn: fresh as in.. they took a shower?
[0:54:04] shadowmoonsmile: it is devastating they puting classic on a dark shelf
[0:54:07] Prayshock: c-c-c-c-crushing blow
[0:54:17] osatox: fresh as in remade recycled content?
[0:54:29] BlueBeast33: There's still time to change their mind on fresh TBC I think
[0:54:35] kappaday23: Kappa
[0:54:43] Klarynse: everything has to have a label nowadays
[0:54:59] Masqerader: yup
[0:55:01] Treeo83: yup

[0:55:27] Masqerader: 5v5 arena
[0:55:39] falldrgn: INC PVP weapons being the best in the game for a while lol
[0:55:52] TweakT: bis lfg system
[0:55:52] gdtomii: that would be good
[0:55:56] gdtomii: LUL
[0:56:00] TweakT: no teleportation
[0:56:03] Shrenko: oh no
[0:56:03] JellonaCub: LUL
[0:56:14] Juginator: do you think there will be ilvl n stuff in the tool like it is now
[0:56:18] Coldlight1: there must always be a way to rate people!
[0:56:37] dragothicx: Gearscore for TBC LUL
[0:56:37] falldrgn: wait.. are they adding Dungeon finder to TBC?
[0:56:46] Macroversal_: why would they?
[0:56:51] warrenny: @dragothicx Or ilvl
[0:57:04] Reiumi_: PepeLaugh
[0:57:05] FranticAlba: @falldrgn Group finder, not automated dungeon finder
[0:57:17] theminerr_: is unfortunately ur new fav word or something? u`ve said it like 94820948 times in the past 2 minutes.... @Towelliee
[0:57:17] Masqerader: @falldrgn not the press the button queue
[0:57:25] gdtomii: whats the change for drums?
[0:57:28] Juginator: @falldrgn nope, only the looking for group tool like for m+ n stuff
[0:57:35] BlueBeast33: If they don't have dual spec, they should at least reduce the cost to respec
[0:57:37] Treeo83: Drums for days
[0:57:44] warrenny: Drums ate in bc?
[0:58:04] kappaday23: Keepo
[0:58:16] BaronVonPancakie: Yep
[0:58:20] Masqerader: yup
[0:58:20] FranticAlba: As someone who is playing spriest in TBC, dual spec would be nice
[0:58:24] BlueBeast33: unfortunately yes
[0:58:30] BaronVonPancakie: Nah. Still fucking terrible
[0:58:32] flyingmachin3: how have you not instance locked yet towJesus
[0:58:32] Storm1854: leatherworkers got a bonus by using their drums that no one else got so thats why they are making the change
[0:58:35] FranticAlba: But idc , if I can't have dual specs, guess I won't heal.
[0:58:42] Tidus99: yeah every few weeks your respec goes down in gold
[0:58:46] BlueBeast33: they should cap it at like 10g instead of 50g
[0:59:09] Tidus99: Tbc needs dual spec
[0:59:17] Treeo83: it still sucked but you made more gold in tbc I mained a feral tank / resto trough all tiers back in the days
[0:59:29] Macroversal_: gold will be a lot easier to come by
[0:59:35] Treeo83: respecced aloth for different raids
[0:59:38] BaronVonPancakie: Maybe that is the plan? Remind the hard core classic whiners why they want the current model?
[0:59:38] RogueBear: what up Towelliee
[1:00:12] Tidus99: most of the tbc private servers have dual spec
[1:00:36] Treeo83: was tank / healer druid
[1:00:39] MrKray2: @towelliee on launch of i leveled a pally from 1 solo how long do you think it would take?
[1:00:53] Thepilli: its more of a pve/pvp talent switching
[1:00:54] BlueBeast33: a lot of respecing is for pve/pvp builds
[1:00:55] FranticAlba: spriest or ele shaman for TBC
[1:00:59] FranticAlba: is my plan
[1:01:12] mmrghost7: which dps class/spec was the most demaned in tbc ?
[1:01:19] Masqerader: I am gonna enjoy leveling disc for arena and murdering teams with mana burn against other healers lol
[1:01:40] FranticAlba: How many people are gonna use their 1 boost they can buy on a Warlock LUL
[1:01:45] RealShifter: @Towelliee if i wanted to join the healer gang what class should i choose?
[1:01:48] Secondbreakfasttt: F, love rocket finished on Eu? i thought it was gonna en today :s
[1:02:14] Tidus99: cause classic needed buncha changes but the people wanted it like it was when it got released

[1:04:39] rhsiuol: how mad are people gonna be when bosses roll over
[1:04:58] raw_o: your screens flickering?
[1:04:59] Treeo83: Black temple pre nerf will spank people
[1:05:03] Noshpan: I fully expect bosses to be a relative cake walk
[1:05:03] Masqerader: Watching the SK gaming video of KJ all the yellow lines of chain heal goodness lol
[1:05:12] BlueBeast33: It's just nice to have 1 raid difficulty tbh
[1:05:17] Shrenko: my eyes WutFace

[1:05:54] Noshpan: I just wish they'd hurry up & make BEs available
[1:06:00] mmrghost7: WHAT dps spec/class was most demanded in TBC ??
[1:06:04] Demanisraar: @Lintgamer Will wait till a driver udate and try again then
[1:06:45] Masqerader: @mmrghost7 mages, combat rogue, shadow priest (mana batteries) and locks were usually the go to
[1:06:51] Treeo83: black temple is huge aloth of running and you don't have portal funktion in the beginning because of rep locked
[1:07:04] othraerir: felmyst will be easy now cuz half the raid won't d/c
[1:07:09] grim777777: hell it takes an hour to run it on a 120
[1:08:07] Treeo83: I actually found my old felcore macros for vashji
[1:08:22] Treeo83: or tainted core rather
[1:08:23] Masqerader: Brutallus was a fucking wall
[1:08:57] BlueBeast33: pre-nerf attunements <3
[1:08:59] Masqerader: ya if u go in there with greens your tank is gonna get deleted
[1:09:07] HotHotHeals: what is shadowlands is the last expac of retail and Blizzard decides to remake the Warcraft world after TBC

[1:13:08] Treeo83: yup
[1:13:44] Treeo83: think it was the stewarts
[1:13:49] warrenny: @sirscottyp 0.0001%
[1:13:54] Zeuzo: Do u think it will be a world first tbc?
[1:13:57] Zeuzo: race
[1:14:03] Reklusion: I really dont want to level on classic but I also dont want to pay for a 58 or 60 w/e they do ...when even playing slow I could level up to 60 on classic before BC comes out lol
[1:14:19] Aidler: @Towelliee godspeed with the last rocket attempts this year
[1:14:44] Treeo83: I was wrong it was only moroes
[1:14:45] ArcaneSyntax: @reklusion leveling in tbc wont be as bad.
[1:15:01] FranticAlba: Can you try for the love rocket again after reset?
[1:15:11] FranticAlba: Event says it ends 10am pst
[1:15:30] Masqerader: so u have 2 hours
[1:15:32] dkwhitegorilla: what should i get for profession in Classic as a prot Pally
[1:15:50] Masqerader: 2-3hrs
[1:15:59] Reiumi_: Pog
[1:16:05] Reklusion: @ArcaneSyntax I would prefer to be 60 before BC comes out, dont wanna be leveling during BC release.. :P
[1:16:06] Screamnsteam: Will you be allowed to server transfer when tbc releases?
[1:16:27] JellonaCub: Do you already have thunderfury for BC or is it not as good as people say?
[1:16:34] FranticAlba: My classic server is garbage
[1:16:43] ElPolloBatman: you got those epic gemstones from mining in the mount hyjal raid
[1:17:29] Armdel: i think my only classic character is alliance on a horde heavy server lol
[1:17:44] Treeo83: paladins just block it all and let things kill them self on the shield spike dmg
[1:17:45] BloodyFatToni1: +30 stam too on consortium blade
[1:17:51] Noshpan: I'm just glad to not be leveling on a pvp server. Did that the first time around just to play with friends. Not doing that again. I'm too old to deal with that.
[1:17:54] BloodyFatToni1: continium*
[1:18:01] Blistz1: YES TOWELLIEE AS A HEALER
[1:18:35] jerseyfive: holy is king in bc arena
[1:18:35] Blistz1: TowellieeTheTank Goes as TowellieTheHealer
[1:18:55] Alaquane: Anything worked 2v2 with a warlock
[1:18:55] BlueBeast33: rogue druid and rogue spriest are going to dominate 2v2
[1:18:57] Noshpan: Can't wait to grind honor for the Season 2 gear
[1:18:58] Masqerader: I am going disc for arena and mana burning the shit out of healers lol
[1:19:02] belfastcl: ret was viable in some melee teams with windfury
[1:19:16] GTmask: ret with a stromescale or something (the weaponsmith only 2H mace) would own.
[1:19:42] Blistz1: was PVP good in BC
[1:19:53] sniffsc: im afraid tbc arena will have a really opressive meta
[1:19:56] Blistz1: like in terms of gear wise
[1:20:01] Elementlolz1: 1.8k for t1 weap and 2.2k for t2
[1:20:06] Masqerader: rating didn't come till season 3?
[1:20:11] Treeo83: Im to old for arenas now adays dont have the reaction time needed so I sadly avoid them now
[1:20:12] Masqerader: of arena in tbc?
[1:20:16] Juginator: you didnt need rating till season3
[1:20:20] BloodyFatToni1: if arena is too meta standard pvp is amazing
[1:20:32] badlock_: wrath or mop was the best arena experience for me
[1:20:40] Yowiepower: 2v2 warrior and resto druids
[1:20:46] BlueBeast33: it'll probably be a few weeks after
[1:20:51] Masqerader: random mace stunn procs lol
[1:21:05] belfastcl: when season 1 starts gear matters a lot
[1:21:19] Treeo83: claive rogues didn't play around
[1:21:25] Treeo83: glaive*
[1:21:39] belfastcl: mostly because when s1 starts no one has resilience, so pve gear makes a great difference
[1:21:40] Masqerader: Ya rating didn't effect things till season 3 when u need it for like shoulders and shit
[1:22:16] belfastcl: yes
[1:22:16] BloodyFatToni1: yeap
[1:22:16] Treeo83: yup
[1:22:20] Blistz1: Yes
[1:22:20] Masqerader: ya
[1:22:27] Blistz1: ohh i miss Resilliance
[1:22:28] fattywaffle420: 1 day

[1:22:36] Treeo83: one of the best things for tanking druids
[1:22:37] flebbooo: mid mop
[1:22:37] Blistz1: Cata?
[1:22:41] Blistz1: or mop
[1:22:44] PadidinJones: oh yea i forgot reseliance
[1:22:47] reymar7: love in the air finished in eu ?
[1:22:49] Masqerader: went for resilience to pvp power
[1:22:57] fattywaffle420: bc played 2 days before mom said cant play cause of the demons
[1:23:29] Masqerader: resilience turned to pvp power in WOD I think
[1:24:32] DegenerateHaven: wowhead wrote an article from an interview wherby blizz is considering tuning PvP gear like WoD where ilvl scales in PvP content
[1:25:08] DegenerateHaven: I hope it doesnt go through
[1:25:31] DegenerateHaven: exactly lol
[1:26:25] DegenerateHaven: PvP is fun right now, don't need to touch it
[1:26:35] Masqerader: Blizzard only knows If it ain't broke, break it
[1:27:24] DegenerateHaven: its also nice that you can play PvP and go into PvE with it with decent results
[1:27:32] MrGattz: if it aint broke, just keep tweaking it until something breaks, then redesign it from the ground up
[1:28:19] MrGattz: at least it was free
[1:28:27] DegenerateHaven: Looks like 9.1 is really far away
[1:28:31] Reklusion: We had a 5 question Q/A because Ion dont stop talking lol
[1:28:34] Reiumi_: why does blizzard hate us BibleThump
[1:28:48] flebbooo: I mean we knew we were going to Argus in like 7.1
[1:29:15] Blistz1: Bro dont mentionn about this blizzcon
[1:29:20] razma_: and even 9.1 we dont know alot about it
[1:29:22] BlueBeast33: 3-year expansion inc
[1:29:26] Blistz1: Xpac annouced next year
[1:29:31] ElPolloBatman: this time you'll be fighting your urge to play wow
[1:29:41] DegenerateHaven: I swear i remember you farming love rocket a couple of years ago, cant believe you are still at it
[1:29:44] DeanoTV: should of delayed blizzcon, i get they're behind and working from home
[1:29:57] Blistz1: u sure
[1:29:57] nezz231: preach said august xD
[1:30:11] dragothicx: what if they just want to keep it under wraps? do they have a need to tease far future content though
[1:30:14] HD_MOVIE_SOURCE: august 9.1
[1:30:22] nezz231: thats a long fucking time haha
[1:30:38] Shammedic: 9.1 june/july, BC Sept
[1:30:39] Thoreya: 0% chance it comes in august
[1:30:44] Masqerader: sloot said June
[1:30:52] DeanoTV: ye 9.1 june, bc sept
[1:30:56] DegenerateHaven: looking forward to BC broken economy with 500g flasks
[1:31:03] HD_MOVIE_SOURCE: bc november
[1:31:04] MyriaK: Love Rocket farming extended to June to fill in the content gap.
[1:31:12] Meshindale: elon musk said sept
[1:31:35] Reap14: What will they use to try to compete with FFXIV Endwalker?
[1:31:55] DegenerateHaven: Love rocket progression group here xD
[1:31:58] ElPolloBatman: d2 open beta?
[1:32:01] DeanoTV: they dont need to compete with ffxiv KEKW
[1:32:07] Reap14: Oh yes they do friend
[1:32:13] DehCantao: @Reap14 our fanatism
[1:32:18] Niixten: 9.1 in August?
[1:32:26] BloodyFatToni1: do you think WoW has much of a hybrid community between classic and retail. im probably wrong but I think most classic players probably dont play retail? not sure though
[1:32:31] schizowillie: Man tough group
[1:32:40] metavahn231: so human pals got sword spec AND seal of blood now?
[1:32:49] Meshindale: grats on love rocket boss kill
[1:32:54] Shinji_Ex: based off math everyone behind by 3 months they barley got the expansion out idk
[1:33:18] Antdavs24: right here lo
[1:33:28] krypkicks: so 9.0.5 march 16th or 23rd then?
[1:33:28] Reap14: I played through all of vanilla
[1:33:34] Malarick: @ Towelliee I watched Lula's cooking stream last night. how awesome were those 2 dishes? they looked amazing.
[1:33:38] Reklusion: Played the end of classic ... like a month before BC so yeah, I will be playing BC because fuck yes xD
[1:33:41] PvtHudson093: I played all of Vanilla but i knew it wouldnt be the same the 2nd time round
[1:33:42] metavahn231: WoW wasent even that popular in classic was it? only like 2 mill players
[1:33:43] Jackshackk: People came over from EQ and were already used to large raids
[1:33:45] DegenerateHaven: never played vanilla and it didnt end up as exciting as it was hyped to be for me personally
[1:33:52] NILLme: i started in mid tbc and im hyped to properly experience that again
[1:33:53] metavahn231: or was it even less
[1:33:54] Antdavs24: i got through to mid 20s in the barrens in vanilla and gave up, then came back mid TBC
[1:34:01] krajar96: did tbc have eye of the storm?
[1:34:10] DeanoTV: chat whats the best bc priv server?
[1:34:11] Reap14: Vanilla was great despite all the bugs at the start
[1:34:12] gdtomii: end of wrath was insane
[1:34:12] krajar96: that was my favourite when i first started
[1:34:15] BloodyFatToni1: yeah i raided classic up to wl then quit and now just waiting for bc
[1:34:18] schizowillie: WoW almost failed because there was a huge drop off from the original players in classic then a whole new base of players started later in classic
[1:34:20] skittlesman09: i can
[1:34:56] Niixten: Preach thinks 9.1 will come in august, I can see blizzard are really behind
[1:35:21] BloodyFatToni1: the way I see BC. its classic but on steroids.
[1:35:34] Antdavs24: lol 9.1 in august wont happen
[1:35:43] DegenerateHaven: BETA!
[1:35:45] Antdavs24: maybe may/june
[1:35:50] Demanisraar: End of June is my bet
[1:35:52] Niixten: okay, so june at latest
[1:35:59] WundertueteGER: 1 year for flying FeelsBadMan
[1:36:03] Stonkeep: ptr in march and release in june most likely
[1:36:05] NILLme: 9.1 is prob in July. Maybe TBC in May as the "leaks" were saying?
[1:36:18] DeanoTV: chat whats the best bc priv server ?
[1:36:31] BloodyFatToni1: Karazhan
[1:36:44] Meshindale: any notable mmo content updates besides wow this year? blizz will prob match their releases then?
[1:36:48] honeychonker: you dont need to rune of power, combust auto drops one for you
[1:37:11] Minoumi: I was here !
[1:37:25] Reap14: April 13th
[1:37:29] Demanisraar: towUnforch
[1:38:00] TheFabilolz: !tbc
[1:38:08] Shinji_Ex: fan fest stuff might come out so may FFXIV?
[1:38:09] TheFabilolz: !TBC
[1:38:12] TheFabilolz: :(
[1:38:14] Bazsidiver: kara
[1:38:15] honeychonker: at 50 yeah
[1:38:16] CritcobainTV: !tbc
[1:38:20] metavahn231: they are all horrible and full of weird people
[1:38:20] CritcobainTV: 😡
[1:38:21] TheFabilolz: Hi chat, hi @Towelliee
[1:38:23] GraaMee: Lights vengance if you want to try classes out
[1:38:23] DegenerateHaven: BC not popular among private servers for some reason
[1:38:30] DegenerateHaven: all about vanila and WOTLK
[1:38:30] Kasaiya13: 14's expansion is meant to be in Autumn
[1:38:32] Thagrius: but but but but.... all the leaks said we would get tbc beta at blizzcon
[1:38:32] BlueBeast33: Warmane was the main one I think
[1:38:38] Antdavs24: LUL
[1:38:45] metavahn231: like tryhards with nothing to lose LUL
[1:38:52] gdtomii: warmane wotlk is full of so many weird people
[1:39:07] flebbooo: Alexensual LUL
[1:39:18] CritcobainTV: KEKW
[1:39:28] Niixten: I can't see blizzard do cata classic, mop and wotlk for sure tho
[1:39:35] metavahn231: the people baned from WoW go to p server
[1:39:38] DegenerateHaven: warmane is a good server tho, short queues at any level and no lag, in fact it makes you realize how shite blizz servers are
[1:39:52] RevOReilly: The question is how is Project Ascension still up and running @Towelliee
[1:40:01] CritcobainTV: @Niixten they're not gonna just skip an entire expansion, that's not what they're aiming for lol
[1:40:22] Antdavs24: i can imagine how heinous private server gen chats are lol
[1:40:47] Eikus11: I see Project Ascension adds on youtube, like how has blizz not come down on them?
[1:40:55] metavahn231: its really not fun to play on a server where 100% of the players are toxic tryharding degends, you need casuals
[1:41:14] CritcobainTV: I can't imagine many people play this Project ascension stuff tbh LUL it looks awful
[1:41:27] noxerii: !guild
[1:41:27] Meshindale: just curious, do ppl still go for private servers now classic and tbc is around?
[1:41:57] metavahn231: and every pserver is pvp
[1:42:08] metavahn231: every single one lol
[1:42:09] Meshindale: probably wrath private server
[1:42:13] Forlagon: @Meshindale people who dont want to pay for wow
[1:42:23] GraaMee: @Veramer light vengence isnt
[1:42:24] Demanisraar: @Meshindale maybe people who can't pay tp play
[1:42:33] Busnasty: !TBC
[1:42:50] Meshindale: good point on he payment
[1:42:52] neorang3r: @Towelliee I heard Saudi prince is trying to invest in Blizz, I guess private servers will now actually blow up
[1:43:12] Meshindale: i guess wrath pservers still have appeal?
[1:43:14] metavahn231: @Graamee i dont count the small ones with tiny pops
[1:43:46] Maxoru0: well yeah. It's like the same for nintendo going after rom sites.
[1:44:23] CritcobainTV: I'm frustrated right now with retail. feels like there's not much to do outside of raid other than spam RBGS or arenas if u like that
[1:44:23] Alaquane: like poe seasons
[1:44:26] Fllaffy: wtf bro don't shame my kink D:
[1:44:28] Burnski: I would imagine they do WotLK Classic and then thats it. No one wants Cata Classic
[1:44:32] Demanisraar: When they launch WotLK classic I am off retail I think.. I don't know think it's because I am a wrath baby and had so much fun back then
[1:44:47] RevOReilly: Do u think its a good idea to get into classic at this stage to prep for TBC
[1:44:49] CritcobainTV: I want cata classic towPog
[1:44:49] Storm1854: id love mists classic
[1:44:54] Antdavs24: LUL cata classic
[1:44:58] Shammedic: WotLK -> MoP skip Cata
[1:44:58] Jackshackk: Wrath would be worth it, but not cata
[1:45:01] vDrYuukey: cata classic with dragon soul remade
[1:45:03] Reiumi_: BFA classic in 10 years?! Pog
[1:45:09] honeychonker: I mean, MoP classic might be good 10 years from now, the raids and class balance was amazing
[1:45:09] JokaThS: i want legion classic slootRiot @Towelliee
[1:45:09] Khalio23: For you maybe
[1:45:14] metavahn231: i kinda want cata with #somechanges Kappa
[1:45:16] warrenny: Legion classic
[1:45:16] Antdavs24: just go straight to MoP after WotLK
[1:45:18] Khalio23: Cata was very memorable for me
[1:45:27] DegenerateHaven: MoP warlock was POG
[1:45:29] DeanoTV: ye could be a classic mop server
[1:45:29] CritcobainTV: @Towelliee cata was when i finally got really good at the game, and legendary daggers, so i had a ton of fun LUL
[1:45:31] acheap: i started playing in Cata. Could care less about it.
[1:45:33] Meshindale: do they make alot of money from classic stuff? if so i imagine they will want to continue that even after wrath?
[1:45:35] DeanoTV: mop lock Kreygasm
[1:45:36] MuttonChopins: I keep getting more and more love for MoP
[1:45:37] silentknight190: I can forget cata to shadowlands.. mop was worse than cata
[1:45:38] Maxoru0: what if they redid cata?
[1:45:40] Demanisraar: I went balls deep in Mop... got challenge mode and everything back then
[1:45:41] Fllaffy: I don't rmember anything of cata LUL
[1:45:43] GraaMee: with the way they are going about seals in tbcC they could treat all the expansions on fixing the oversights they had
[1:45:46] Burnski: I think Cata was the point where you really can't call it "classic" anymore. The whole world revamp and all.
[1:45:52] metavahn231: the game stops being classic when the pruning happened
[1:45:59] Malarick: I left MOP for SWOTOR
[1:46:17] Clicklesly: I feel like the big change was removal of talent trees ^^
[1:46:20] NILLme: some will but not majority
[1:46:20] Antdavs24: highly doubt it
[1:46:20] Specsifier: People think they want Cata, but they don't. Cata was TRASH
[1:46:23] DeanoTV: naaa
[1:46:27] silentknight190: I'll draw the line at wrath
[1:46:28] Demanisraar: I would ask for Cata LUL loved prot pally in cata
[1:46:31] Masqerader: MOP they got rid of hit/expertise rating, good times
[1:46:35] woody879: ask for mop and skip cata
[1:46:38] metavahn231: but wasent surv hunter good in cata
[1:46:39] Shinji_Ex: they could have a sub check system example you own the game like GTAV RP works idk
[1:46:44] gdtomii: I would like cata classic too
[1:46:56] damianpaladin: Cata was by far my most played expansion. I would ask for Cata. Ret Paladin was fun in Cata.
[1:46:58] Meshindale: do they make alot of money from classic stuff? if so i imagine they will want to continue that even after wrath? somethign to keep classic alive?/
[1:47:01] hardcorl: i has a long break in cata^^
[1:47:10] raymond3195: they will ask for cats to mop release
[1:47:18] Khalio23: How can you forget the amazing content patches for cata? ZG, zul aman, Well of eternity and the other two dungeons? plus some cool raids apart from one
[1:47:20] Demanisraar: Yep
[1:47:21] raymond3195: cata
[1:47:22] Demanisraar: KEKW
[1:47:28] Demanisraar: soooo goods
[1:47:29] Masqerader: WOD classic AFK Collectors Edition
[1:47:32] Specsifier: cata content was awful. classes might have been good, but the content was terrible
[1:47:33] metavahn231: only people who want cata are people with agenda's LUL
[1:47:34] flebbooo: I will never forget your inqu boom videos Clap
[1:47:35] byrdeen45: I want classic WOD
[1:47:37] Demanisraar: Vengeance
[1:47:42] mighty4eyes: Cata was my favorite time in wow
[1:47:45] Screamnsteam: If you have a spectral tiger or big blizzard bear on live servers, think they will carry over to tbc servers?
[1:47:57] metavahn231: WoW 3
[1:48:09] CritcobainTV: @Screamnsteam doubt it
[1:48:10] Khalio23: @Veramer Couldnt it just be people with that enjoy other things that you dont?
[1:48:13] Burnski: 11.0 = WoW2
[1:48:13] Clicklesly: The CE stuff will carry over, not sure about anything else ^^
[1:48:16] ventu105: Morning @Towelliee and Chat
[1:48:16] GraaMee: think they will change 10 man if they do wrath?
[1:48:23] Demanisraar: Get full hit parry dodge cap and never getting a critical hit.. we where gods as prot back then
[1:48:41] Screamnsteam: @critcobain SMOrc wth
[1:48:42] silentknight190: hope so they don't need a 2 decade old engine
[1:48:45] Meshindale: when wow 2 comes, then every expansion before that will be in classic servers
[1:48:48] metavahn231: its pretty unanimous that cata wasent great, so i dont know why blizz would do it @Khalio23
[1:48:49] hardcorl: wow on consoles ^^
[1:48:51] MuttonChopins: it would be cool if they did what Valve did with their games with their new engine
[1:48:52] flebbooo: TRUE KEKW
[1:49:02] Khalio23: People enjoy expansions for different reason its kinda narrow minded to think they are wrong to enjoy something about an expansion
[1:49:13] Antdavs24: lol let the big boys actually do mechanics KEKW
[1:49:31] GraaMee: TBC intrests me because of the changes
[1:50:00] raymond3195: mop was best
[1:50:01] Khalio23: @Veramer wasnt great according to who? its kinda subjective
[1:50:02] Niixten: Legion classic with the legendary vendor from start
[1:50:09] DegenerateHaven: farming Tol Barad dailies lol
[1:50:14] Demanisraar: Wotlk till mop was my favourite time.. after that I started taking more and more breaks

[2:05:11] Meshindale: It was so terrible, the blackout, that Train said in the call to Esfand that he'd rather get covid 10 times over than stay where he was
[2:05:15] Antdavs24: lol no difference honestly might as well just go pitch a tent outside
[2:05:19] lukaskar: @Demanisraar both of my parents had it, one had only back pain and the other had some issues with it but nothing serious so at least that was a good thing

[2:17:07] Atombomb1987: we need more memes taking the anima drought story boards and applying them to a WoW content drought
[2:17:13] Gr3atAp3: Agreed. I hope you're right about the timeframe of 9.1.
[2:17:16] Yulya_Oh: I miss Legion farm
[2:17:20] Khalio23: Would rather play legion than bfa and SL any day of the week
[2:17:26] Hybridwarhawk: Once we get over that post launch hype, we settle into the lull for a few months that eventually gets turned around
[2:17:31] Shrenko: Im happy about no farming this expansion
[2:17:32] danimoto10: I think that the most angry I see you about an exp since when I started following you on legion lunch
[2:17:34] warden86: same loot for weeks in a row :(
[2:17:38] TweakT: Suramar looks ballin with my RTX 3080 Kreygasm
[2:17:41] shadowmoonsmile: you cant make people happy no matter what u do
[2:17:44] Gr3atAp3: Wod v2
[2:17:44] raymond3195: can't see it getting better wod 2.0
[2:17:54] Typh166: I really hope 9.1 comes soon August is going to be rough Id imagine massive drop off if that happens.
[2:17:54] BlueBeast33: I've literally just been farming anima since the expansion launched
[2:18:06] DeanoTV: 9.1 will be june
[2:18:08] Atombomb1987: Would this make Activision the Maw that Blizz is pouring there priorities into

[2:18:22] Niixten: SoO all over again LUL
[2:18:23] PToastman: Depends on COVID imo
[2:18:23] reformedalex12345: @Puns_Blazing yh especially venari rep.. lmao dude
[2:18:23] gdtomii: Choreghast KEKW
[2:18:24] Phil87z: I feel like COVID is making the patch cycle longer

[2:19:05] Gr3atAp3: It's all just framing with all this. If blizz came out and said 'yo listen, its taking a while, things are hard, we're working on tons of stuff' then it would be fine.
[2:19:06] Screamnsteam: M+ ResidentSleeper
[2:19:11] SamULJackson: atleast tbc is coming so thats something i can look forward to
[2:19:15] Gr3atAp3: Massive failure in expectation management
[2:19:16] George2001k: I have 5 max lvls...it is a good alt expansion!
[2:19:18] Masqerader: that alt friendly game where I go days without seeing anything in mythic + but valor points gonna fix that cause it will take like 2 weeks to upgrade something lol
[2:19:19] Antdavs24: lol i got shit from someone in here thats its no longer an excuse but working from home is clearly taken a toll
[2:19:22] Shallo1988: ight boys back to Classic!
[2:19:30] cabalish: blizzconlinesoon tm
[2:19:35] SilverMyr13: what would be alt friendly? I think threads of fate adds to that
[2:19:43] MetaKuron: Is Azuresong set in stone as the realm for tbc?
[2:19:44] MrGattz: @Typh166 wait did blizzard ever actually promote that? cause i actually dont remember. i remember thinking that it was really alt friendly the first like couple weeks but after that it went to shit
[2:19:51] othraerir: gotta do 2 m+ now?
[2:19:51] Orthobullet: They are loweing it, to 9 keys i thought
[2:19:53] Khalio23: @udrisyay You need help brother
[2:20:01] Cinni_Bunni: I've had no issues gearing three characters. I have two at 214 and a third already at 200 that just dinged 60 yesterday.
[2:20:32] ElPolloBatman: time to get your alts into mythic raids!
[2:20:37] fuzzymanthing: maaan this is why I'm excited for TBC, and currently still play Classic. It just feels better. It's more rewarding for the time you put into it, and doens't feel so damn hand-holdy or grindy for +1 item level
[2:20:38] Kahoolo: I was considering abandoning for classic and prep for TBC, but I don’t want to fall behind in retail.
[2:20:46] SonofHorus82: Did you decide on a Hammer Squad server for TBC yet?
[2:20:50] ElPolloBatman: followed by leveling all 50 characters to 60 and gearing them
[2:20:52] MrGattz: !tbc
[2:20:52] gdtomii: im not a doing a single m+ before valor KEKW
[2:20:52] Moobot: We want YOU for a WoW TBC raiding guild! Apply now! || http://towelliee.com/tbc || We will be choosing Azuresong Horde for our TBC server! Start leveling now!

[2:21:22] George2001k: Am I the only one who things that Tyrranical needs another nerf?
[2:21:25] flebbooo: yeah i'm basically just raid logging for mythic with the guild and do +14 atleast and then just lvl chars for tbc
[2:21:34] reformedalex12345: @gdtomii not gettin weekly 226 KEKW

[2:23:05] griffdog125: graphics flickering like crazy
[2:23:07] mmrghost7: why is his screen flashing
[2:23:22] Lunarsear: @mmrghost7 graphical bug
[2:23:25] MrGattz: its the nvidia drivers for dx12

[2:24:40] MuttonChopins: PvPers sound more and more spoiled tbh
[2:24:46] honeychonker: it was actually a good Q&A tbh
[2:24:48] lukaskar: why is it censored?
[2:24:50] Meshindale: Moobot doesn't like the word t r u m p e t?
[2:24:53] Antdavs24: T R U M P e t <- see the issue lol
[2:24:54] whiptail: account wide for all tubas
[2:24:54] honeychonker: came out before the english one
[2:25:02] sarcilav: PvPers don't understand that the change it is actually good for them, it will stop the carries, and they will have a normal ladder again
[2:25:07] ArcaneSyntax: lmao
[2:25:09] Antdavs24: moobot picking that up lol

[2:28:43] MrGattz: i can fool around with the filter
[2:28:47] ArcaneSyntax: @towelliee yep theyre gonna try to get BC after the hype for 9.1 dies down.
[2:28:49] Kromede: 82 towHAMUP
[2:28:56] othraerir: hahah that sketch
[2:29:03] fuzzymanthing: eh, August TBC just means we can grind it out til then lol
[2:29:06] MrGattz: maybe avoid that for later but honestly, how often does the word trumpet show up in chat? i think that might be the first time in 10 years.
[2:29:07] Brickneim: in deep blue sea i got ate by a fucking shark
[2:29:13] TinmanFPS: I feel like the % of people raiding naxx and hardcore playing retail has got to be a super small %
[2:29:15] borgmanson: plenty of time to play Diablo 2 :)
[2:29:22] JMoney_1331: don't you like my movies?!? Deep blue sea, that was a good one!
[2:29:23] MrGattz: so i dont see a huge reason to fool around with it
[2:29:25] Meshindale: no worries gattz just wondering lol

[2:30:26] ArcaneSyntax: i mean the reverse also works but is worse for us
[2:30:48] Antdavs24: theres no shot lol
[2:30:55] Meshindale: i mean, naxx came out with shadowlands...they might do it for bc?

[2:31:03] MrGattz: november at the latest
[2:31:06] AirmVn: so prepatch in april and release in may
[2:31:08] Kahoolo: In TBC, is it only Blood Elves that can play Paladin?
[2:31:10] AirmVn: may the 5th
[2:31:12] AirmVn: my prediction
[2:31:13] Urebaldd: I definitely don't see april, if it does release then it will be a mess
[2:31:15] Khalio23: do you think may is a possibility?
[2:31:17] AirmVn: sorry 4th
[2:31:28] borgmanson: the guess was TBC May to compete with New World but now with NW delay... Blizz has all the time they want
[2:31:31] BlueBeast33: guilds are still running Naxx for Atiesh and shit
[2:31:38] griffdog125: as a wow player since 05. is ff14 worth playing right now.
[2:31:44] mmrghost7: naxx out Kappa
[2:32:01] khakifry: @Towelliee whens the camera coming in?
[2:32:09] khakifry: @Towelliee I miss that beautiful face of yours
[2:32:22] Meshindale: 3 year expansion maybe?
[2:32:24] Urebaldd: I'm trying to get to 60 in classic, but man it takes so long
[2:32:29] Antdavs24: yea im pretty sure were going to have the longest expac in a while
[2:32:55] dcorey416: you think D2 will come out before 9.1
[2:33:06] honeychonker: They could release the patch then the raid maybe a month later
[2:33:18] Zonoxx_tv: 9.1 in June is very optimistic
[2:33:28] board4life65: your crazy we are going to a 9.3
[2:33:29] Antdavs24: either 9.2.5 or they push the next expac into 2023
[2:33:31] Alienfromger: new 2 boss raid LUL
[2:33:34] MuttonChopins: I honestly would of thought Sylvannas was a 9.2 boss
[2:33:47] honeychonker: I think they have A TON of story to tell though, with the dreadlords, cosmic war etc
[2:33:56] BlueBeast33: I think 9.3 will still happen
[2:33:56] borgmanson: the Jailer fight will be fun, chains everywhere
[2:34:09] MrGattz: idk that i would assume that this early
[2:34:12] Meshindale: do oyu think they can release 9.1 in june though? Blizzconline didnt revela much..maybe they havent done much asset or worked on it yet?
[2:34:16] danimoto10: how the vaccines works in cali? @Towelliee
[2:34:25] azzurrin: Whatever the last boss is of the xpac is, I bet it will be in Azeroth. Jailer will probably take the flight to our world
[2:34:34] Khalio23: Are you hyped on D2 remaster?
[2:34:40] MuttonChopins: Yeah aren't less than 1% people getting the COVID vaccine
[2:34:42] dcorey416: they didn't really have anything to show for any games at blizzcon
[2:34:47] honeychonker: They're doing it by age in the UK, with everyone promised it before July 31st
[2:34:51] mrrazputin: Do you think that would be a good idea if insted one 9-10boss raid in tier we would get like 3x3 raids? could be cool for lore and story telling.
[2:34:54] zskeech: US vaccination programme sucks
[2:34:58] zskeech: compared to UK
[2:35:00] Kriven: I honestly would have been fine if they just skipped blizzcon instead of doing online this year felt like they just tossed it together randomly
[2:35:06] Urebaldd: I got my vaccine but I have a health condition, I dunno when everyone else gets it
[2:35:19] khakifry: @Towelliee depends on the state... in PA you can get the shot now if you are over 65, smoke, have a bmi over 30, have diabetes, etc
[2:35:19] MrGattz: US most everything that requires coordination of any groups sucks.
[2:35:21] Zonoxx_tv: 9.1 is in very early stages, June seems unrealistic but I hope you´re right
[2:35:28] MrGattz: just the way it is
[2:35:35] Hazcore: I dont care to get it. Respect to anyone elses decision
[2:35:39] ElPolloBatman: to me the most interesting part of blizzcon was the announcement of rogue for d4. now i want to see how the game turns out in terms of balancing and endgame, because i don't want to be forced to play pvp there
[2:35:40] Khalio23: @Urebaldd Asthma?
[2:35:42] Shrenko: didnt feel like a Blizzcon at all
[2:35:44] azzurrin: Should have been in April
[2:35:50] Shrenko: not just because of covid, but of what they showed us
[2:35:57] Secondbreakfasttt: LUL August? Some people loves drma too much
[2:35:57] dcorey416: it felt like ok let's just throw something together and hope it does well
[2:36:00] Urebaldd: @Khalio23 Nah I have type 1 diabetes
[2:36:13] griffdog125: @tacovendor93 i work in the medical field and deliever med supplies. most med workers that have for the 1st and 2nd set of shots have all been sick. alot of surgery centers shut down because the hole staff got sick from the shot
[2:36:16] Ertra: just ordered my D2 Prime Evil Upgrade
[2:36:18] Carryout: D2 was great
[2:36:24] Kahoolo: Over watch was a major letdown.
[2:36:30] Khalio23: @Urebaldd I see
[2:36:32] MrGattz: d2 is really good. most people like it over d3 still
[2:36:33] azzurrin: Didn't give to shits about classic, but I'm pumped for TBC.
[2:36:37] azzurrin: two
[2:36:40] dcorey416: @kahoolo agreed
[2:36:55] heavenscloud1517: Overwatch 2 shouldnt even be happening, it should just be a huge content patch for Overwatch
[2:37:00] heavenscloud1517: IMO
[2:37:02] BlueBeast33: Best thing about D2 is making a bunch of different builds and then dueling people all day
[2:37:05] MuttonChopins: the Deep Dive for Diablo 2 was really great
[2:37:16] azzurrin: @heavenscloud1517 Yup, just could have been an xpac
[2:37:26] cabalish: #nochanges
[2:37:30] Meshindale: thats the thing @Towelliee they didnt show much..maybe they are very early stages of workign on it...maybe thats why preach estimated august?
[2:37:37] postman_quest: thats why it was free lol
[2:37:43] Honvar: No worries they will leak it soon Kappa
[2:37:47] dcorey416: covid and activision kicking blizzards ass right now lol
[2:37:51] Masqerader: oh and the smacking SMACK SMACK SMACK SMACK /close browser
[2:37:52] azzurrin: They showed us concept art of the raid and shit, you know they're WAY out
[2:37:54] Zonoxx_tv: and people thought they would be teasing 9.2 bc 9.1 should be right around the corner
[2:37:55] borgmanson: Diablo 2 team seems to really care about the product
[2:37:58] Kriven: @Meshindale we know thats the reason
[2:38:21] SilverMyr13: we got what we paid
[2:38:32] Blistz1: Wait, what if there is a blizzcon in november toh
[2:38:38] PadidinJones: Comon man i know you could really use a win here but I think blizz knows that this is a content filler for you.
[2:38:43] Orthobullet: Uh?
[2:38:54] Kriven: maybe nov of next year

[2:40:04] Meshindale: how much must we buy to actiavte sloth?
[2:40:17] Lokajin: Honestly companies have been looking for a way to get out of doing conventions COVID gave them the best excuse to never commit to conventions again and stay digital.
[2:40:20] MrKray2: Did we get any dates/months for D2?

[3:48:20] JokaThS: intence gaming
[3:48:21] PadidinJones: Cant you just spam that dungo?
[3:48:23] xxplicitt: What was Towelliee playing in Vanilla? I never caught those streams
[3:48:34] JesusGamer420: it I install it, there is no way I could stay on track with that
[3:48:38] xxplicitt: Oh well that makes more sense now lol
[3:48:39] Sortsnak: How does it feel being back in classic after being on retail for an extensive period?
[3:48:48] SonofHorus82: you dont have the dungeon map add-on?
[3:48:54] cevyr1: I can watch keys anytime, when was the last time I saw RFC as anything but a speed run? Game, blouses

[3:49:32] D3m0nHunt3r666: Team Cow
[3:49:40] Montsubu: i played a oomchicken
[3:49:59] sl1nky1981: Yeah, it is
[3:50:10] Waspire: its there but they removed the mobs
[3:50:13] realdevv: Doesnt it ruin your immersion abit to use a modern UI such as elvUI
[3:50:17] Waspire: and quest giver
[3:51:11] ArcaneMaki: lol those kids
[3:51:11] steffan747: leveling to 60 in classic is such a grind
[3:51:28] Madnis8: im much more immersed in my netflix than my UI after having played wow so long
[3:51:31] Montsubu: and immersion when ashes of creation come out
[3:51:33] sl1nky1981: I can't say I have any desire to play classic
[3:51:38] realdevv: Its not that bad tbh i've done 10 60's in Classic
[3:51:49] sl1nky1981: I'm spoiled by the quality of life improvements in Shadowlands
[3:51:50] jerexify: @Towelliee I have a 22 Hunter I'll likely transfer to Azuresong. I think saving 22 levels in Classic is worth $25.
[3:51:52] realdevv: Just gotta enjoy the moment and not worry about the goal
[3:51:52] MuttonChopins: Especially with paladin leveling @Madnis8

[3:52:31] eatonaround: does elvui classic list mod health on the UI?
[3:52:35] realdevv: Im just one of the people who like old grindy games, i guess im the target audience
[3:52:38] realdevv: Weird right
[3:52:39] eatonaround: *mob healt
[3:52:42] ArcaneSyntax: i got to 46 last year and couldnt do it anymore. gonna try and power through now.

[3:52:52] Raw_Doggin: @Towelliee whats the server?

[3:54:52] eatonaround: @TacoVendor93 okay cool. thanks! i've been thinking about using it in classic. since im a little light on addons and stock UI doesnt show mob health
[3:54:56] CADZtv: llol

[3:55:38] hectabit: lmao
[3:55:40] realdevv: @eatonaround If you like the standard frames you can get the addon called "Modern TargetFrame" then it becomes like the Retail ones with mobhealth/threat warning and everything
[3:55:41] Madnis8: the real drama is gonna revolve around DST off gruul ngl

[4:36:09] MILESkg21: talent what D:
[4:36:10] Masqerader: and all ur shit transfers over u earned from 1 which is nice
[4:36:19] Daggerstry: Heroes of the Storm 2. They redid Heroes when it was flailing
[4:36:20] PokerFaceMoose: i would say HoTS 2.0 was different
[4:36:22] Shrenko: yeah talent tree looks amazing
[4:36:22] AnubiS1690: dude RIP Daft Punk
[4:36:35] ndilicious: HotS had a 2.0 update, not an actual sequel
[4:36:35] Padarius: Poor HOTS, was such a fun game
[4:36:36] Carmisin: The way Warcraft is going. Lich King might make an appearance on WandaVision
[4:36:38] toobaked1987: HOTS what is that? Blizzard didnt even drop their name! ahahah
[4:36:42] Wcvechten: I think they said the name like twice
[4:36:44] PokerFaceMoose: hots was basically put in maitenance mode awhile back
[4:36:48] Sollice: Ethan tbsts not really Hotspot that was imgame design change
[4:36:49] Shrenko: HOTS is still doing okish I believe
[4:36:58] Sollice: stupid phone
[4:37:00] Masqerader: I think they were mentioned in hey we have this game, but hey we don't give a fuck about it
[4:37:01] ElPolloBatman: hots was dumped into the rts variety stream, they got some overwatch inspired skins announced
[4:37:13] Waspire: i thought hots was being cancelled...
[4:37:14] IamEavrus: ITs hilarious how they just exempt a WHOLE game on people who love it because its not popular.
[4:37:15] MILESkg21: they broke up
[4:37:18] Drevok1: yep split
[4:37:19] MILESkg21: 28 years
[4:37:20] Masqerader: ya

[4:38:21] Padarius: He's a bruisier, he carries around kinda like a flail
[4:38:25] Shrenko: you throw dynamite and meat and stuff and spin around being annoying
[4:38:31] Carmisin: Hogger main ability is auto attack lol
[4:38:40] TheCliffyShow: Hi, everybody!
[4:39:04] ElPolloBatman: remember that blizzcon raid, method vs hogger, where he charged and one shot every member?
[4:39:06] ghostofnappa_doom: i was a jaina 1 trick for so long on that game lol
[4:39:07] Shrenko: I still play HOTS regularly, the ARAM mode is way too much fun
[4:39:13] WhiteKnight74648: Uther was op AF
[4:39:21] ElPolloBatman: could've been another guild, if not method
[4:39:23] Sollice: HoTS still has a good population. you get in to games fast

[4:40:12] finlayg98: I could've sworn blizz stopped giving a toss about HoTs. good population?
[4:40:19] Sollice: they said no OW2 in 2021
[4:40:24] TheCliffyShow: We'll see it on the same day as Half-Life 3.
[4:40:24] kamisengames: Star Wars Squadrons tourneys are all player driven as well
[4:40:30] Clicklesly: I thought you can also keep playing OW1 and the matchmaking merges the people?
[4:40:30] Zansteh: i cant wait for d2 or d4 :(

[4:42:33] vemkmeuput: D4 should have Clerig. Paladin + Priest mix
[4:42:34] ghostofnappa_doom: So have you decided what realm you're doing TBC on?

[4:50:05] Wackhaus: Have you ever thought about looking in your other pocket for the big love rocket? You know, the one with the zipper
[4:50:25] pk99: like the store owners were gonna throw it out instead of selling it
[4:50:30] manmower: no they're 6
[4:50:33] Lifestream7: isnt bud plat 6%?
[4:50:53] sphynx_rayne: I thought it was 8 at one time
[4:50:56] Wackhaus: You mentioned my name, that was all I wanted
[4:50:57] toobaked1987: Please do yourself a favor and upgrade your Budlight
[4:51:02] Thoreya: its probably gross dude
[4:51:16] winter4856: The Legal % of beer in the U.S. is 6% in Germany it’s 12%
[4:51:27] mrpresbaby: towUnforch
[4:51:35] MILESkg21: probably tastes like shit
[4:51:39] Lifestream7: like wine :P
[4:51:39] PokerFaceMoose: i just drank a 8.5% beer last night
[4:51:41] MisterWoodhouse: Probably tastes like a really shitty vodka soda @Towelliee
[4:51:42] PuffyTheMagicalDragon: you can still get craft beers in the u.s.way more though
[4:51:45] PokerFaceMoose: so idk what you talking about
[4:51:49] nihilistic_bat: ya no
[4:52:01] othraerir: us is doubled though
[4:52:03] TheSpace_Sloth: yeah thats not right at all lol the US has some VERY strong beers
[4:52:04] PokerFaceMoose: in utah its like 3 or something, but that is the exception not the rule
[4:52:06] sphynx_rayne: I gave up drinking I just smoke weed now lol
[4:52:13] nihilistic_bat: thats a state or local county law thing
[4:52:13] BigLoe: That’s malt liquor
[4:52:16] MWilco77: @Towelliee That Bourbon County I tweeted you this weekend was like chocolate cherry cake in a bottle. Amazing
[4:52:18] dimofodi: @Towelliee some states have lower legal limits, Oklahoma can only sell 3.2 but you can driver across any border and get 6
[4:52:24] FattBeard: It's 67% in the US not 6%
[4:52:30] Leruxia: Is Burning Crusade and Wrath zones the only "untouched/unchanged" zones? (Sorry, random question.) Debating doing lore master for those 2 expacs cause I'm blinded by BC Hype.
[4:52:42] Lifestream7: I hate smoking weed gives me anxiety. prefer drinking
[4:52:49] akia03: the comercial beers like bud coors miller are 5% while eu beer is 5.1-6%
[4:52:59] chunkysalsa_: The laws are weird. Over a certain % it is technically "barley wine", not beer. Only matters for the permits to sell.
[4:53:20] othraerir: at 18% is it beer, or brandy?
[4:53:21] Screamnsteam: I travel back and forth between the US and a Germany religiously , both style beers mess you up don’t get it twisted LUL

[4:54:42] Keyastaron_: yea i should have some.
[4:54:47] Leruxia: @teh_villain awesome. Thanks!
[4:54:59] MisterWoodhouse: @Towelliee We had a bunch of our developers from Poland join us for a summit in Florida early last year. They all wanted to go out for draft Bud Heavy and Bud Light because they wanted to taste it domestically.

[4:56:35] LegoCoin: this is it!
[4:56:44] ghostofnappa_doom: so what exactly does blizzard expect us to do from now until patch 9.1 ? because 9.0.5 has no real incentive to play

[5:08:13] HaxzorJimDuggan: boost a druid for a free epic flying herbalist
[5:08:34] Shrenko: @HaxzorJimDuggan free flying? towPog
[5:09:02] XadanarGaming: assuming boost is going to be 60 bucks. as an old classic andy not really opposed to the boosting people are going to do it in dungeons or through RMT so might as well give blizz a chance to make some $$ in hopes of more classic content
[5:09:09] TheSpace_Sloth: yeah their flight form is from the trainer you dont have to shell out a ton of gold but it is slower if i remember right @Shrenko
[5:09:21] TheSpace_Sloth: until swift form anyway
[5:09:30] Shrenko: @TheSpace_Sloth druid it is then!
[5:09:31] GnomeLickerGames: didnt they say everyone get a free boost one per account in the Q A?

[5:11:19] Shrenko: new shadehound mount?
[5:11:23] ghostofnappa_doom: 60 bucks isn't that insane. saying as Classic took most people 2 weeks+ to get leveled up, instead of spending 30 hours of time just to level to play new content you cut that grind out.
[5:11:27] pk99: some of that shit has 500mg caffeine
[5:11:39] TheSpace_Sloth: KJ or KT probably

[5:15:09] MisterWoodhouse: Oh a Fel Reaver would be badass for the TBC Classic statue
[5:15:14] Bayne77: there was a broken questline about that one dude's loyalty and you see illidan at least once i think
[5:15:18] Daggerstry: You do see Illidan in one small quest in Shadowmoon Valley as part of a jailbreak quest

[5:21:17] we_are_whomp: prince can legit 2 shot you in p2 as a tank
[5:21:17] TheSpace_Sloth: i mean aside from warlock summon you cant even complete the attunment before flying
[5:21:18] Broomba: there are 100000 love rockets, towelliee is just trying to get 1
[5:21:24] 0VAK0: yeah they say do it at 68 since you have to run 5 dungeons so it make sit worth doing them

[6:14:38] TheCliffyShow: It haunts me in my dreams man. I can't even watch a space shuttle launch without bursting into tears.
[6:14:49] Phalamore: @Towelliee are you considering switchingto TBC as your main game or is that going to be a side project?

[6:15:24] Masqerader: love isn't the word I would use to describe this mount
[6:15:29] zenothebambino: @Towelliee i put it in discord the reddit post
[6:16:04] TheCliffyShow: That would be someone in the support group. He suffers from PTLRD, Post-Traumatic Love Rocket Disorder.
[6:16:23] Fondre01: Preach estimates 9.1 in Aug and the leaks earlier this year put BC in May

[6:17:22] Klauzzer: waytoodank
[6:17:26] Masqerader: only thing u can't zerg in kara is nightbane, since will need to do quest to open him up
[6:17:30] Roffasauras: May for BC is very wishful thinking
[6:17:31] MrGattz: its flickering cause of a driver issue
[6:17:32] 無職提督: its the dorce!
[6:17:37] TheUnknowing: August is far too long for 9.1, preach is cool but take his opinions with a grain of salt
[6:17:38] 無職提督: force*
[6:17:39] zenothebambino: it's a direct x 12 issue
[6:17:42] Masqerader: It's gonna be June
[6:17:45] TheCliffyShow: Whelp, that's my last Love Rocket attempt for the year. Maybe in 2022.

[6:23:10] kanxer808: @Towelliee you talking release in retail? in august or bc?
[6:23:11] Fondre01: His point was that everything we saw was early concept work - no fly through of the raid / dungeon, etc
[6:23:16] firebombdk: den F me..... blizz i need more Renown!!
[6:23:29] MILESkg21: vouch

[6:23:48] Broomba: watching soda play as a kitty last night in GTA RP was freaking awesome!
[6:23:56] ArcaneMaki: Best expansion ever. Oof. But yeah personal to everyone.
[6:23:57] Masqerader: When you're thinking about doing islands, it's a sign
[6:24:15] Lexi__Marie: meh, i dont care about raiding/ and i still enjoyed WoD
[6:24:23] luckfore: hope your right
[6:24:31] givmeafrekinname: Finally!
[6:24:33] Shrenko: yeey
[6:24:35] manmower: at this point i think any content they had planned for 9.3 is off the table

[6:24:35] MILESkg21: solo islands ...

[6:24:44] Vetere30: Vetere30 subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 7 months! 
[6:24:44] 3663Sharad: Maybe the item loot shortage is a countermessure to the content drought?
[6:24:46] LycanKain: That means they have to get the scaling right, which is a longshot at this point
[6:24:46] TheCliffyShow: Hopefully Mythic will be solo queueable.
[6:24:46] possibly_dave: if I can rofl stomp them, totally fine with that
[6:24:47] rivera9: 1 V 1 PVP ISLANDS
[6:24:52] Keyastaron_: i think the expac shouldve released in october then everything would have been fine
[6:24:58] Atokiri: if only Islands would work as Torghast instead of the horde vs ally farm shit
[6:25:04] Shrenko: are you asking us?
[6:25:07] eldercandle: i lowkey like the concept of islands
[6:25:14] Masqerader: i think u will be fine against the npcs
[6:25:14] s0kana: I would hope it's 1 v 1 lol
[6:25:18] Mystirose: likely no pvp islands
[6:25:33] TheCliffyShow: I hope mythic islands will be solo queueable to.
[6:25:34] manmower: they should have a rotation of world boss mounts that they roll into the islands
[6:25:41] Holdtoskip: might set you up with bots
[6:25:43] 無職提督: and it so despaired that they have to making changes in previous expansions stuffs

[6:33:44] Pallananana: only blizzard can make a problem of the solution FeelsBadMan
[6:33:46] Mattven: onlt the top 1 % of players can get ksm
[6:33:59] Osskssa: so worse than when @Towelliee had to rub his nips all the time after surgery
[6:34:07] ColdPizzah: no way the easiest ksm was season 4 bfa with corruption @Thagrius
[6:34:15] dkapocalypse: they would of did better if they just let you upgrade and thats it
[6:34:25] L4nds1ide: bfa ksm was th easiest corruption ftw

[6:35:09] L4nds1ide: tanks top dps kekw
[6:35:17] Keyastaron_: i work 8 hours a day 5 days sometimes 6 days a week and i stil got KSM
[6:35:33] L4nds1ide: @keyatlass same here m8
[6:35:42] pk99: soul ash catch up when
[6:35:43] luckfore: why didnt they add valor to raids like they did in other expacs
[6:36:02] iblighters: They don't know what they're going to do with Twisting
[6:36:12] Waylash: You forgot to put on your poisons
[6:36:13] Dirtroit: Invites to m+ hinder Ksm to. As a rogue. I have to spam the sign up buttons for hours
[6:36:27] Thagrius: I'm already at 8k/8k on my hunter rofl
[6:36:41] tbbex_: have many times overall have u run the dungeon

[6:36:52] pk99: 50 a day * 18 days
[6:37:06] Keyastaron_: @Iandslide I meant in BFA in SL i dont have any 15s timed only did a +15 for completeion i have 2 11s timed 1 10 timed and others are less than 10 timed
[6:37:30] L4nds1ide: @keyatlass that's ruff dude
[6:37:39] SilkeySmooth: thats because b;izzard doesnt not play as casual players
[6:37:53] Gizadragon: still neeed heals
[6:38:04] TheBiggestDorc: yea but timing 15 is super easy tho
[6:38:05] Thagrius: I 2 chested a 13 pug ToP earlier. I wasn't expecting that lol
[6:38:35] Itachi914: its easy if u can even get into a group
[6:38:36] L4nds1ide: sanguine depths is aids I no alot of people stuck on that 1 for achiv
[6:38:40] Keyastaron_: i still remeber @Towelliee didnt turn in or get an essence so he farmed SO MANY echos of Nyolatha
[6:38:42] kappaday23: Keepo
[6:38:48] Itachi914: im at 1200 io barely get into any groups has a mm
[6:38:52] Itachi914: as*
[6:38:52] D3m0nHunt3r666: I just started timing 14s. The problem is not being able to time, but actually getting invited to them lol
[6:39:06] Ryok: i can't even get into 15s because of raiderio zhealHaha slowly crawling up by getting into 12s and 13s
[6:39:12] L4nds1ide: the best way to play is push your own key
[6:39:12] SilkeySmooth: the blizzard should be forced to play as casuals try to pug m+ and see how it is to be casual
[6:39:13] Wheeellz: those people arent getting 1800 either....if you dont have the time for that or ksm you dont need the 220 loot in the first place
[6:39:19] tmxobl99: Well I just got back into wow after 2 yrs being away. I am 40 yrs olds now with tons of family stuff, still loads to do, trying to pay casually after raiding hardcore back in the day
[6:39:27] xrandomdoodx: blizzard always claims that homogenization of classes is bad , but when you have a meta of like 4-5 classes only, maybe they should spread the utility around to other classes to make the balance better.
[6:39:28] Sincline387: AOTC/Mythic raiders already have the gear.....do you wan't to DE more lol
[6:39:31] aeon0987: @Towelliee does KSM on a single toon unlock 220 m+ on all toons?
[6:39:58] Keyastaron_: PVP is on par w pvp
[6:40:08] cerality: You get hc gear for all 10s, that should be pretty achievable for most?
[6:40:12] Keyastaron_: w M+ hear sorry
[6:40:16] deadawake_: towUnforch towUnforch
[6:40:18] Keyastaron_: gear****\
[6:40:23] Dirtroit: Raider io is killing the game more than its helping
[6:40:33] SilkeySmooth: force blizzard to play as casuals and pug m+ then you will see a change
[6:40:35] wazon_7: lmao what a bullshit
[6:40:38] Ryok: @Dirtroit agree
[6:40:41] 3663Sharad: @Dirtroit Not really, its more the expectations of the ppebs
[6:40:47] Thoreya: not really
[6:40:52] HaCKeD_S14: @Dirtroit you can't fix those social communities as a dev though. Players created it
[6:40:58] Itachi914: raider io is dumbest shit ever
[6:40:59] pk99: top gear dropping from dungeon should be 220. and you should also be able to upgrade to 220
[6:41:01] Dirtroit: Anyone saying not really doesn’t get it LUL
[6:41:24] macanudo17: Good luck T
[6:41:28] duhworks: 212 or 213
[6:41:56] pk99: thats what i was aiming for with 220. somewhere in between yeah
[6:41:58] Vodkanic: @Itachi914 no it keeps us from having to play with plebs like you
[6:42:03] wazon_7: dirtroit stuck at 1200rio being rejected to every group says its bad guys, so its bad!!1
[6:42:06] Kerhlen: as a casual I had so much fun in legion
[6:42:10] bumpstock75: everyone hated warfronts BUT it always dropped decent gear
[6:42:12] Moose_Ka: they should remove all stat gear from the game
[6:42:14] Thoreya: raiderio tells us whos shit at the game
[6:42:19] Moose_Ka: only cosmetics and skill matter
[6:42:23] iEntropius: I've been around 206 for 2 months :( feelsnad
[6:42:23] Thoreya: sorry there needs to be something that differentiates good and bad players
[6:42:26] TheCliffyShow: @bumpstock75 I didn't hate warfronts.
[6:42:48] Thoreya: not even good players but at least competent

[6:44:49] Maydie6066: Raider.IO isnt the only problem though @Towelliee, people have become meta slaves to rankings from WoWhead/Icy-Veins, so if your not a top 8 dps on those rankings, getting into any PuG is near impossible
[6:44:52] Dirtroit: You can literally buy runs to m+. Raider io is cancer to the game
[6:44:53] Thoreya: well it tells you theyre raid progress on the rio in game
[6:44:58] Thoreya: so obv
[6:44:59] Vyntage1: RIO is as worthless as Ilvl due to boosts/sales/carries.
[6:45:16] bansalt: @Vyntage1 very true
[6:45:16] 3663Sharad: Purley score isnt that accurate. Like you said, look at the arsenal and watch how many runs they have. A KSM buyer wont gut into +15 that much, i think?
[6:45:17] Chibs243: Raider io, gear score, same unreliable shit
[6:45:22] wazon_7: @Dirtroit you can literally buy mythic 10/10, whats your point?
[6:45:25] Kromede: i have the love rocket, everybody should invite me Kappa
[6:45:25] Ryok: but you can also buy mythic nathria xD
[6:45:29] propoopimus: Only time raider IO is viable when you are 1700 plus
[6:45:30] Thoreya: u can buy boosts for literally anything
[6:45:32] Thoreya: stupid argument
[6:45:33] NispyCriblet: 1k is like middle of the road IO at this point in expan
[6:45:48] luckfore: i link KSM with fake achievement and get invited to most groups LUL
[6:45:53] manmower: run their credit scores
[6:46:13] sphynx_rayne: Like i said I don't worry about IO. I know i know the game and i do what i want i paid for the game lol
[6:46:18] rivera9: 2 QUES LEFT :/
[6:46:19] Vyntage1: I wish they have a times 20 for every key achievement. That could also allow for the valor upgrade to be 226.
[6:46:20] wendigo721: what happen to the cam
[6:46:21] tumb_tack: yah, I am in an casual AOTC guild, and valor will not help anyof us.
[6:46:28] Keyastaron_: LUL

[6:46:46] Darkgx5: I think bliz will balance it they usually do lol

[6:52:50] ZealotryTV: @manmower at this point it has to be a metrics based thing. They probably have data that shows that is the case
