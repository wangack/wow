[0:34:16] Zeberdy: the fact a billion dollar company are hosting a tourney in this format is a joke... imagine an FPS game did this xD unplayable
[0:35:19] Zeberdy: i think all teams involved should just collectively refuse to compete when its like this FORCE them to make a LAN
[0:35:19] Echo_Esports: Celebrate Echo's latest win in the RWF with the New World First mousepad and loads of other great merch at echogg.ly/merch/Raiku

[0:36:34] kaiwyldx: though you did go r1 in us last expansion, was that hard due to ping aswell? @Raikubest
[0:36:42] kaiwyldx: if i recall correct
[0:36:46] Pat124: @Zeberdy they would probably just stop doing tournaments before doing another lan. hell im surprised they still do tournaments considering the amount of viewers LUL
[0:37:23] chakloonozavr: #fuckrussia
[0:37:25] Zeberdy: i just think all Orgs just collectively agree this format is unplayable and not at all competative, shameful from a company this size
[0:38:00] keshishka: fuseton team will suffer then
[0:39:02] kaiwyldx: aha, thats why it was easier to push r1 in 2v2 with meh i suppose
[0:39:30] pleebiceps: They just should make a Lan tournament if they want to do crossrealm one ... No ping advantage
[0:40:16] miinawow: wydm about ''cross region in 2.5weeks'' ?

[1:41:05] cryzzer7: we all laughed at SL S2 but Id much rather go back to that than this
[1:41:07] ra_1336: so feels good to pay for nothing
[1:41:13] ramagod: the begin of this season made me quit
[1:41:37] Delxenyo: And btw what made you change name from bestworld to Raiku
[1:41:49] Rofyx: It sucks most for the average joe that was getting 1.8k and 2.4k and glad and shit all of BFA and most of SL (except s4 maybe) and now they struggle to even get close to these ratings so they just quit
[1:42:26] blueberrypieface: I swear they just did that to bait people into thinking wow they're actually balancing
[1:42:27] Echo_Esports: Time for a break...from your current job? Come work with Echo! Apply at: echogg.ly/apply/Raiku
[1:42:27] ramagod: ^ i got duelist week 2 and then i just sat there ??? for 1month stuck there
[1:42:28] unsteddy: imagine weekly patches like LoL
[1:42:29] peestii: season 1 was crazy for the amount of constant changes
[1:42:58] Zaiyge: they should just make the game like baseline and just improve one version of the game and add stuff
[1:43:02] LocoBandito96: people just play SoD instead hahaha
[1:43:11] blueberrypieface: yea I guess that too
[1:43:17] LocoBandito96: SoD is rlly bad for retail
[1:43:26] CerebroLUL: is SoD balanced?
[1:43:37] Bastzzz: @CerebroLUL no xd
[1:43:40] pronatorteres: what do you even do in SoD, what's the point?
[1:43:44] SirBeaverTeeth: is lontar as good on priest?
[1:44:10] brawlcuttt: is dh good with a boomy ?
[1:44:35] welaxoxo: ultra bull meta will be the best for you
[1:45:04] neunMilli: @pronatorteres having fun for like 2-3 weeks and dip again
[1:45:06] bash1ro: Lontar is insane on evoker heal too
[1:45:08] neskox: the ultrabull LUL
[1:45:09] echterdolens: u just missing meh

[1:45:33] neskox: LOL

[1:45:58] randompug12: @LocoBandito96 nah
[1:46:13] iliketurkle: Do you beat Mehh irl and in wow?
[1:46:19] neskox: i would have guessed everything but not mehhsham
[1:46:54] LocoBandito96: what u think about multi r1 pvp players going full m+ like this one healer who plays mdi now
[1:46:59] Bastzzz: @LocoBandito96 u cant dom nobody with a priest rn, not even meh
[1:47:12] kaiwyldx: is 4 the limit of a roster? or could u have mehh as priest(backup healer) in case you watned to rmp some matcchups?
[1:47:30] neskox: it does that
[1:47:42] bash1ro: holy priest can do big dam with haste build, but I think u can only play it in 2s
[1:47:59] SirBeaverTeeth: lontar has 3-4 weeks to practice his priest then :D
[1:48:15] SirBeaverTeeth: ah shet
[1:48:33] Fedds_29: is cross legion lan?
[1:48:49] kaiwyldx: was it hard for you to adjust from having a god priest, to have a god rhsma?
[1:48:51] Bastzzz: haste build on hpriest is not good on mana i think
[1:48:51] SirBeaverTeeth: and you predicted the future too, playing against pika with bad ping haha :D
[1:49:05] holyblessz: what is your ping in na?
[1:49:06] iliketurkle: Do you beat tren at dh?
[1:49:17] SirBeaverTeeth: true
[1:49:35] peestii: blizzard hasn't realized is aids to play with lag on cross region tourneys?
[1:49:47] Echo_Esports: Gear up for raid with a world-class sitting experience. Enjoy the same long-lasting comfort as Echo, only with the Secretlab TITAN Evo gaming chair: echogg.ly/secretlab/Raiku
[1:49:50] LocoBandito96: do u rlly loose games from ping?
[1:49:52] Swdswpvtmcmd: You'd think theyd just host it central or even EST, get it a bit closer
[1:49:58] yuriuxd: if u think 105 ms is lag ur delulu
[1:50:09] LocoBandito96: ok insane
[1:50:10] deno65: not worth to travel there ?
[1:50:21] archtme: whaaz seemed pumped to go there
[1:50:32] yuriuxd: ur not gonna play from NA?
[1:50:35] yuriuxd: a
[1:50:41] peestii: @yuriuxd that's kinda lagged tho, if u play with 10ms everyday
[1:51:26] magnusz: u mean to tell me forcing ppl to lag isnt good for competitive play ?
[1:51:42] xdtai: europe to cali? isnt that gonna put u at like 130 ping
[1:52:13] magnusz: ya europe has 150-180 ping
[1:52:28] kaiwyldx: Juste use a VPN Kappa
[1:52:32] magnusz: then prev has 250-300 ping
[1:52:34] Zevyn1312: They should be able to add artificial latency for the home team so everyone's on an even ping footing
[1:52:37] tony1992qt: so retarded
[1:53:04] LocoBandito96: lmao
[1:53:06] Cybernytez: i dont get why they do this online cross region at all
[1:53:12] Cybernytez: why no lan man
[1:53:24] Zevyn1312: @Cybernytez not economical
[1:53:27] brezkovtv: they have to invite all players at same place
[1:53:27] zxcRAT: HOST TR SERVER ON THE MOON
[1:53:30] vtadeas_: blizzard cheap dogs
[1:53:32] LocoBandito96: its insane then that EU won most of the tourneys or not?
[1:53:34] SaltyBites: multi dollar company
[1:53:40] Frostqttv: Frostqttv subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 60 months! yo
[1:53:41] Vathaya: yeah they dont want to waste pennies on lan
[1:53:42] maqorey: y
[1:53:50] tony1992qt: waste of time
[1:53:58] Cybernytez: yeah its just bc they are cheap af that why they dont do  a lan
[1:54:00] Frostqttv: <3
[1:54:01] Zevyn1312: @zxcRAT EU and NA on opposite sides of the world, they'd have different pings to the moon!
[1:54:05] magnusz: cross region tourney imo is disrespectful to the pvp community because they dont get to see who the best team is in true competition (LAN)
[1:54:29] tony1992qt: so troue
[1:54:31] grris: blizzard should get a cruise ship in middle of the ocean
[1:54:33] grris: and hold a LAN there
[1:54:34] grris: most fair
[1:54:34] Cybernytez: yeah they could put a server in a middle somwhere at least
[1:54:43] archtme: itis disrespect but they have been clear for many years they dont take this seriously, pandemic just gave them the excuse to cancel lans altogether
[1:54:43] zxcRAT: HOST TR LAN IN LONTARS BASEMENT
[1:54:44] magnusz: they should just host it in ohio again and go back to how things were before covid
[1:55:27] ibasel: maybe NA should have 100+ MS debuff
[1:55:30] Cybernytez: when i had beta and beta was on westcoast i had like 240 ms or something from EU LUL
[1:55:38] magnusz: yea its just another way to milk the players without giving them anything i n return
[1:55:39] Echo_Esports: Want to learn from the best? Visit echogg.ly/coaching/Raiku and pick the Echo player that suits your needs!
[1:55:43] Cybernytez: had like 2 sec delay lags
[1:56:03] Vathaya: dont get why they shit on wow competitors so hard
[1:56:21] Baazil: Can't they implement like in CS, you have to win with 2 rounds?
[1:57:05] unsteddy: get all eu teams to organise scrim blocks?
[1:57:06] Baazil: Ah yeah for sure
[1:57:16] magnusz: yea have to win with 2 rounds so u end up playing 20+ rounds because playing on 200 ping is a complete meme
[1:57:23] magnusz: such a meme format man
[1:57:36] Cybernytez: i said that in cdews chat with the lag and he said if i think that is a big thing thats its rediculous ... i like cdew a lot but i cant wrap my head around why my take is rediculous
[1:57:45] magnusz: yea only ppl on east coast like me could do it
[1:57:51] magnusz: i get 110ping to eu TR
[1:57:52] Vathaya: disadvantage this, disadvantage that. laggy servers, average announcing, minimal esport reward money. like theres no point to pursue for many many people . craziness imo
[1:58:07] Baazil: Well, what's your solution then @magnusz? let them play on china?
[1:58:14] MartyrTV1: just rent a airbnd in boston
[1:58:16] magnusz: my solution is LANs
[1:58:16] MartyrTV1: for a week
[1:58:21] MartyrTV1: and ez win
[1:58:23] MartyrTV1: 5Head
[1:58:26] magnusz: blizzard just doesnt want to spend the money
[1:58:30] randomtwitcherxo: wow will never be a big esport , too hard to understand for ppl not playing it, so business wise its just a waste of time focusing on it, would be for community reasons only
[1:58:31] Baazil: Paid by the players then
[1:58:40] Djalextv98: @magnusz they are poor
[1:58:45] magnusz: why should the players pay
[1:58:53] magnusz: LMFAO what the
[1:58:55] ungodlyxdx: awc is sponsored by Exit Lag
[1:58:56] Cybernytez: imnagine cdews team with boomy they will be omega advantaged on NA coast LUL no one will EVER kick a boomy kick haha from EU lol
[1:59:17] Baazil: @magnusz Blizzard don't want to lose money* WoW arena is sooo tiny on the esport scene, unfort
[1:59:21] MartyrTV1: doesnt boston get 70ish
[1:59:22] MartyrTV1: to EU
[2:00:01] magnusz: they should just play eu vs eu on NA servers
[2:00:04] magnusz: to rly show case what a joke it is
[2:00:29] magnusz: good luck trying to kick samiyam on 180 ping
[2:00:30] randomtwitcherxo: jaime would land it
[2:00:38] randomtwitcherxo: just need premium bot for dmg also
[2:00:40] grris: You can see raiku kicks on 17ms, now imagine 170 monkaW
[2:00:52] Dastion001: Is this a legit way of checking ms from EU to US etc? ***

[2:04:32] magnusz: i remember getting sheeped slands s1 and just hearing

[2:06:28] magnusz: if u get bad bracket u lose
[2:06:40] magnusz: coin flip every time u sign up
[2:06:45] peestii: playing with lag is insanely troll with precog in the game

[2:07:35] magnusz: yea i normally know what happened but i actually have no idea
[2:07:46] magnusz: maybe he wasnt here

[2:10:48] peestii: saved
[2:10:49] SirBeaverTeeth: pika won 3-1 in tiebreaker
[2:10:55] jerrysp: bait q
[2:11:05] atomic_gossipgirlxo: Where were those games streamed?
[2:11:14] Mimou_: your on na or 2nd dh?
[2:11:21] SirBeaverTeeth: but kubzy won in upper bracket when he played arcane mage, confusing
[2:12:06] SirBeaverTeeth: true
[2:12:41] Miyagix: how much for whaazz to do trill dmg
[2:12:51] Miyagix: KEKW
[2:13:02] Cybernytez: so will the s4 tourney also be online cross region?
[2:14:26] OnkelKokos: A normal evoker wouldent probably. Meehx would :D
[2:14:41] Talones: what dragon u got?
[2:14:50] mehhx: evoker would never win vs ww sub but , vs rls my evoker would be good but no1 in EU plays rls and vs dh lock it would bne fine aswell
[2:14:53] mehhx: vs howton team i wouldve played disc most likely
[2:15:03] mehhx: its much better than it was last season and last season we played disc every time vs sub
[2:15:12] Cyndren99: what if mehh starts to play with pyllymake, and the finnish men beat echo? @Raikubest
[2:15:20] holyskyler: probably a lot of people already asked: why didn't you mirror them in AWC way earlier ?
[2:15:53] Knozyr: cross region tournament where they make eu play NA?
[2:15:57] SirBeaverTeeth: @Cyndren99 yeah anybody know what happend to that healer, he banned for a long time?
[2:16:24] de_dude: will the tourney offline?
[2:16:27] beastboyy122: @knozyr yea EU will play NA server
[2:16:34] Echo_Esports: Celebrate Echo's latest win in the RWF with the New World First mousepad and loads of other great merch at echogg.ly/merch/Raiku
[2:16:35] beastboyy122: echo is the Lower seed
[2:17:03] OnkelKokos: Evoker - ret - Destro/arcane should work. The peels off, deffensive`s from ret and the pressure in itself is a deffensive :>
[2:17:23] Bastzzz: i think rdruid meta is worst idk...so long games to dumpening
[2:17:31] Cyndren99: @OnkelKokos Ret will never win AWC
[2:17:57] holyskyler: but I think it's a bad idea that points are shared between Cup1/2 and Cup3/4. It's a different season so that makes no sense
[2:18:49] holyskyler: you should travel to the US and play from there. Honestly worth it if you win the finals ^^
[2:18:51] atomic_gossipgirlxo: Just gotta cheese them with dh/war/fw in round 1 on NA
[2:18:58] beastboyy122: or they all in on lontar on EU server and win Kappa
[2:19:11] drumpogket: how is ping gonna work xrealm
[2:19:31] holyskyler: true
[2:19:35] beastboyy122: @atomic_gossipgirlxo you talking crazy no way they will play sp if echo lock that in
[2:19:45] Celybran: but then you got NA advantage
[2:19:53] Celybran: and you go 3-2
[2:19:55] beastboyy122: and I doubt echo will play FW Ret warr
[2:19:55] eduartha: you dont use dragonriding?
[2:19:56] atomic_gossipgirlxo: @beastboyy122 First game is blind, is it not
[2:20:00] Cyndren99: S OMEGALUL bad
[2:20:01] exit602: Hi raiku, how you feel hero talents frostfire
[2:20:35] holyskyler: well
[2:20:46] crunchynuts63: when will RMP be great again? this addon sucks for RMP
[2:20:54] zxcRAT: wait
[2:20:55] Knozyr: Gonna be interesting
[2:20:57] SpKstarcraft: would it really?
[2:21:00] lilec9: @Raikubest what decides which server you start in a Final?
[2:21:08] beastboyy122: @atomic_gossipgirlxo thatâ€™s true, imagine that delay hoj on us server lol
[2:21:09] crunchynuts63: ? im from frankfurt yes
[2:21:11] zxcRAT: are points not reset on cup 3/4 @Raikubest
[2:21:18] holyskyler: you need to go to PORTUGAL.
[2:21:23] lilec9: if #1 NA vs #1 EU seed?
[2:21:27] holyskyler: Westernmost point. Cabo da Roca, Portugal (9Â°29'56.44 W)
[2:21:32] echterdolens: Why do u know that hes german?
[2:21:35] Raikubest: /roll
[2:21:59] holyskyler: so you have the best balance between EU and US in terms of latency
[2:22:03] lilec9: lol months of practice decided by /roll :D
[2:22:10] Chrizirl: lmao, the infamous /roll
[2:22:15] crunchynuts63: what are your feeling concerning RMP? how you guess im german
[2:22:41] atomic_gossipgirlxo: LOL

[2:25:44] BoomynatorTv: baila
[2:26:11] HankzEU: blizz is lazy as fuck man, all 3 versions of the game is bad atm. That is fucking shocking. Wrath - SoD % retail how is that even possible
[2:26:14] holyskyler: I believe a buff to hunter
[2:26:14] nickfr0stt: and arcane nerf?

[2:26:21] tony1992qt: arcane nerf?
[2:26:31] nickfr0stt: what about caster monk
[2:26:38] lmaoerss: Why is ret pala being overlooked, i swear they do same dmg as DH
[2:26:50] holyskyler: and fire mage buff
[2:27:09] nickfr0stt: they should remove ancient teachings and buff monk casted heals
[2:27:11] LocoBandito96: if u try to have 3 versions of wow u dont have a decent version they should focus on one game again
[2:27:22] Rettalius: @lmaoerss because paladin suffers different things

[3:42:32] SweetGamingTTV: @Joey_Brown thats like saying logging into someones crunchyroll to watch anime is stealing
[3:42:44] Espi_27: you just need something between queues
[3:42:57] Arwenyo: just joined, 48min queue, are you high rated on DH or is the game dead? :D
[3:43:00] SweetGamingTTV: @Joey_Brown or using google to study for a test instead of your study book is stealing? make it make sense
[3:43:04] Espi_27: ah
[3:43:06] Joey_Brown: @SweetGamingTTV I dont care to clog chat with why you are wrong
[3:43:17] Akrololz: u know the game is bad when even raiku isnt playing shuff OMEGALUL
[3:43:52] quasxi1: @Raikubest how gym going?
[3:43:56] Arwenyo: the SoD kinda killed retail
[3:44:02] fiftyfiftyyes: thats lie only few classes play the game
[3:44:03] Akrololz: it's not the SoD
[3:44:07] fiftyfiftyyes: its still alive boys
[3:44:08] Akrololz: lol
[3:44:11] fiftyfiftyyes: KappaRoss
[3:44:15] Nemesizzz: dividing the player base over 4 games is kinda a bad idea imo
[3:44:22] Akrololz: SoD is even worse
[3:44:25] liqlevlinggod: Mmr
[3:44:32] Akrololz: somehow
[3:44:42] Arwenyo: @Akrololz I mean the game killed itself, but seems like people play more SoD than Retail, but I might be wrong
[3:44:52] azliaris1: bro how are you STILL in queue
[3:44:57] Akrololz: ppl play more SoD cuz hype is there
[3:44:58] azliaris1: i actually alt tabbed for ages
[3:45:06] Akrololz: only the reason why ppl play this shit
[3:45:09] liqlevlinggod: They fired thr onlyone who even tried it xD
[3:45:37] Thesia_: the bro who posted that prob doesnt even work on it anymore
[3:45:38] Thesia_: its radio silence
[3:45:40] azliaris1: no they dont lol they balance with AI
[3:46:35] oWcsgo: Please clip this <3. I wish this was true!!!
[3:46:40] azliaris1: yea but that level of care doesnt exist
[3:46:42] kebablover55555: man they are doing fine, m+ metrics are over the board
[3:46:43] eXceFPS: you are talking like the top 0.1% matter to them :D
[3:46:43] azliaris1: cause they dont give a shit
[3:46:44] Calmseeker89: They only care if ppl stopped playing SOD
[3:46:45] Echo_Esports: Gear up for raid with a world-class sitting experience. Enjoy the same long-lasting comfort as Echo, only with the Secretlab TITAN Evo gaming chair: echogg.ly/secretlab/Raiku
[3:46:46] fiftyfiftyyes: why you think they care about pvp tho ? :D
[3:46:49] winehouse_id: @Raikubest They balancing with AI
[3:46:51] Kezople: I think pvp players have very little impact on overall numbers and its only at the top as well right
[3:46:52] Rettalius: there are so many ppl playing to be honest, you are wrong, its just PVP thats kinda dying but 80% of wow population do pve anyways
[3:47:50] clipt1c: @Rettalius my elo is shit and I still get like 50 min queues, kinda dying is an understatement KEKW
[3:47:51] slickdaddyg69: raiku do u play same build with rogue than u do with chan as warlock?
[3:47:57] azliaris1: they know, they dont care idk why youre blind to this lol
[3:47:59] Whaazz: u still dont have wargalives or? KEKW
[3:48:06] Whaazz: warglaives
[3:48:10] azliaris1: THEY KNOW AND DONT CARE
[3:48:17] blinkers89: i mean... are the devs not reaching out to you?
[3:48:25] uffdatsdirty: numbers are fine in  pve
[3:48:28] winehouse_id: They care but they are blind
[3:48:31] d_a_n_o__: @Raikubest "carrot and stick", for people under 2k, who keep subbing even if the game is bad. That's who they care about.
[3:48:31] uffdatsdirty: nobody cares about pvp
[3:48:33] shredder1111: at the start of the xpac they were praised for rapid changed and good comms, now there's none of that
[3:48:38] shredder1111: feels like they only care s1
[3:48:38] blinkers89: on what the players would do... or streamers rather
[3:48:40] clipt1c: If they didn't care I doubt they'd continue to invest in awc @Raikubest
[3:48:42] gregtehcow: numbers good in m+ and raid was up aswell so its w/e for them
[3:48:43] slickdaddyg69: they dont care about how many that plays the game cuz those who plays the game pays every month
[3:48:48] fiftyfiftyyes: cos little % play pvp
[3:48:51] winehouse_id: THEY CARE BUT THEY ARE BLIND IT IS FACT, THEY DO NOT KNOW AND THEY DO NOT SEE
[3:48:58] carringtonztv: the shareholders
[3:49:02] Nemesizzz: also having 4 different expansions kinda bad cuz it divides the player base also maybe Classic,SOD and WOTLK classic maybe are popping off and compensating for retail?
[3:49:16] gfknw: you forget the most importent thing with money, is time
[3:49:19] DipdabTwitch: This is just a PvP perspective though, PvE is doing better
[3:49:20] akvertical: they compensate from SOD so they dont care
[3:49:24] kebablover55555: its not number only thing, there is so much internal politics in big companies, that overshadows it
[3:49:31] gfknw: is how much time it take toi make money
[3:49:37] gfknw: are u dumb xD
[3:49:37] Millehx: So most good players are stuck around 2300?
[3:49:49] fiftyfiftyyes: Pve is more than better it was low and bad in season 2 cos of the Exodia
[3:49:50] fiftyfiftyyes: comp
[3:49:54] gfknw: mmr? we talk abnout money or
[3:49:56] fiftyfiftyyes: but atm no aug evokers
[3:50:14] slickdaddyg69: the reason i like raiku is because he dont do youtube he almost never streams meanwhile hes the best player in the world makes him kinda mystical
[3:50:47] kebablover55555: pve is not dying even tho all russians left already xD
[3:50:50] azliaris1: @Raikubest how many videos have venruki made on the mmr issue since s2? i think atleast 20 by now
[3:50:57] azliaris1: they know and just cba to fix it
[3:51:19] azliaris1: it's literally impossible they dont know
[3:51:31] slickdaddyg69: @azliaris1 venruki dont care about wow all he cares about is getting his viewer number up
[3:51:34] gregtehcow: nah they do it on purpose for some reason no one knows
