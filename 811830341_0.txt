[1:29:08] Enigmio: @Towelliee Within that, there's a wide range of more purely optional pursuits, things like the Covenant specific features like Queen's Consortium in Ardenweald or the Ember Court where you're mostly chasing cosmetic unlocks, utility, some profession items that have economic benefit but aren't necessary power.
[1:29:13] Enigmio: Ion quote on wowhead
[1:29:15] JVTX23: what addonds do u use for that spells interface

[2:19:42] Empyrialist: most are instead of/removed for kyrian

[2:20:22] Janigiv: for*
[2:20:24] Rottencoarse: there is a disclaimer at the begining of that recommendation
[2:20:26] Ezekyler: still sticking with Night Fae, i don't care what is the "best"
[2:20:37] radgol_: I am happy that I don't care about what covenant is the best for me :)
[2:20:39] othraerir: kyrian gets the phial of serenity too

[2:21:07] Sollice: Oh good MM hunter is marked as Amazing fore Kyrian and Night Fae
[2:21:08] Critizin: all these recommendations are based on having all the rows unlocked and certain soulbinds, ur best covenant will be different during progression
[2:21:09] DrFresky: is this a good channel for a new wow player to watch?
[2:21:19] I_DoctorSatan_I: Yeap, the "knee jerk" switching of BiS covenants for players really sucks. becasue you already KNOW people in M+ and Raid will be looking to see if you got the BiS or Underwhelming Covenants. That's the "competative" and "1%" mindset. No BiS, no invite.
[2:21:25] Rottencoarse: @DrFresky yeah man
[2:21:28] alex12645: i think its going to get nerfed
[2:21:30] br0fest0r: that whole covenant thing is a mess
[2:21:33] PadidinJones: Its a meaningful choice
[2:21:37] Furyio: Do what I'm going (Mythic top 200 raider) pick what you like aesthetically and dont worry about it

[2:21:59] Ezekyler: is not a mess, is the people always following what is the best in a game where changes happens too often
[2:22:00] Fortism: Is Kyrian gonna get nerfed for M+ you think? @Towelliee Same way alot of ppl think about Venthyr for raids
[2:22:00] farmermantz: play what ever you want

[3:23:57] drhobox: Those aoe cap systems and other shit is probably enough for me not to even get the expac, pvp was horrible in bfa and with aoe cap i have no place in mythics and thus i can never gear my monk for pvp.

[3:31:53] Apheelia: Do we need to be lvl 60 to solo legion?
[3:32:02] othraerir: no
[3:32:12] I_DoctorSatan_I: @pesusuihke That's a real numbner. I questioned that myself, and it's 100% correct, 240 HR marathon.

[3:33:37] DanielDotWav: its ok to change your opinion about things that change.
[3:33:40] snoo_32: I like retail sometimes because it's fast pace, no need waiting for auto attacks and slow combat from classic
[3:33:44] sevens777s: juat hope theres not a log que to log in .... I know im being naive lol
[3:33:49] king_julian_96: Yeah classic who would want to play that when a new expansion is 1 day away

[3:36:36] KayEeVeeEyeEn: he was basically selling gold for follows and subs, was so cringe man
[3:36:39] Zeems_Gaming: I think they mean UC > portal to STV > fly up
[3:36:41] Descina: I think classic will hit up to wrath, then they will stop.

[3:37:10] comraddoge: just talk to the guy in the portal room that goes to dark portal. Then fly to karazhan
[3:37:14] Monsmickelsson: You have to talk to the guy in the northren blasted lands to select the old timeline. or you will get into the cataclysm "outland" i think
[3:37:16] Phatlooter: #No Changes did not last long in Classic lol
[3:37:18] Chrysophylax_I: @Apheelia nothing
[3:37:20] JiveOne01: is that a typo.....240hr marathon?
[3:37:21] Psycols: @Towelliee what is the box you ordered ? can we order one too ?

[3:37:49] eatedcookie: @Towelliee brill hearhstone is the 200IQ play. you can buy 3 org cloaks to get back to org but brill lets you port to org, stv, northrend quickly. better connections something to think about :)

[3:38:30] MasterScourge: 24h mara or 240h hahaha
[3:38:33] wizzanoo: the lvl was fun in classic and doing the dungeons i enjoyed all that like yourself i went to raid MC and left and quit first raid

[3:38:41] its_ya_boi_kratos: @Howlpoint no :)
[3:38:48] cynical_effect12: You could have taken portal to blasted lands and then flown up from there
[3:38:49] Tuppe: Even Esfand moves on
[3:38:49] hocho1: leveling was great, level 60 content was boring AF in classic

[3:38:52] mo197: towRng
[3:38:52] Frallin16: open arms is a loose term
[3:38:59] Thunderbrew: Swifty has been playing Retail for a bit now.
[3:39:03] RuthlessWelshy: @Psycols what box?
[3:39:11] ProClicker: No changed Andy's got muiltiboxing banned but the muiltiboxers found away around the ban
[3:39:13] Murlocz: Those guys from private ruined Classic. Toxic af with World Buff drama, dispelling people and shit
[3:39:20] Kisswani: P.R.E.P
[3:39:26] Psycols: @RuthlessWelshy the food box with all the munchies

[3:39:42] Bl4ckSauce: Esfand is more of a variety streamer , it's not like Esfand is excited about retail
[3:39:42] Tuppe: Esfand wants retail to succeed, otherwise there will be no retail or classic
[3:39:42] dalaraz: i think they do it to steal some of the hype
[3:39:44] TheFabilolz: P.R.E.P like Staysafe KEKW
[3:39:48] JulyPJ: Do you think the world first race will be more exciting now?
[3:39:50] Moobot: Calm the spam, @CrsAlpha (warning)
[3:39:51] notademon: To be fair the most fun is always the begining of expansion/game release
[3:39:56] RasmusFardig: I really dont like this "We and them" kind of mindset, so unnessesary
[3:39:58] manmower: classic was probably new to most of them
[3:40:08] Arcahan: tomorrow is retails big day sure, last chance to convince many doubters too
[3:40:09] king_julian_96: like asmon he always plays retail no matter how bad it gets he plays both
[3:40:10] snoo_32: retail has more support as well as nicer people and more content than classic. Classic is fun, but very niche, and it's very hard to support it forever
[3:40:10] RuthlessWelshy: @Psycols he bought them all separetly its not like a box u can order lol
[3:40:11] liqpd: the community drove me away from classic

[3:40:34] manmower: they're gonna be packed with content
[3:40:36] TCP_Citizn: Classic requires a constant flow of new players
[3:40:38] kBumky: theres nothing wrong with classic andys coming over for the content but you always have to appreciate guys like towelliee who is a ride or die retail
[3:40:44] Kaahi: yea i wish they spread out naxx and shadowlands more
[3:40:45] fluh_: kinda excited to see how Cherryvodka and them BDGG boys do in the raid

[3:41:00] sphynx_rayne: No OW feelbadman
[3:41:00] Murlocz: Im happy naxx is coming out so they come back to Classic and dont bring they toxicity to Retail

[3:41:46] coffeeatm: Atleast i dont hear the crap of them saying Classic was harder raid wise, well all saw how that argument went
[3:41:47] snoo_32: i feel like some classic people are insecure about their game. It's ok to not like retail but don't have to be passive aggressive about it
[3:41:51] Psycols: @Psycols box of munchies he ordered with all the chips
[3:42:02] Thunderbrew: Aren't the Private Servers for Classic overtuned?
[3:42:07] Descina: im taking it naxx releases tuesday? my guild is still on mc lol

[4:05:02] PadidinJones: Oh totally you have been but we are less than 36 hours away. So it is a bit nerve wrecking. Always trusted your judgement and feedback cuz its never toxic
[4:05:04] Chrysophylax_I: idc about tuning and abilities. I'm hype for the transmog and themes
[4:05:11] Sikinos: elemental shamans is necrolord ?

[4:05:38] Menion01: BFA was good at the end?
[4:05:43] Thunderbrew: Only the very top 1% care about the Covenant system. The casuals who pay for the game don't care that much.
[4:05:43] Eshel: @towelliee how quick does GFuel customer service respond? I’d like to know if they’re going to do anything about shipping a leaking a can
[4:05:44] MOXP: if i had to guess, i'd say that it is going to be kind of like in legion. first 2 or 3 tiers bad and then it's getting better. i personally won't buy SL until 3rd tier or so.
[4:05:48] Ezekyler: bring back Azerite Kappa
[4:05:49] JustTipsy: JustTipsy subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 31 months!

[4:06:12] WonderinJoe: wait your a sub aren't you?
[4:06:15] GordoHippo: do you think they will focus less on borrowed power in the future? i.e future expanisons
[4:06:26] Vivelli: @jmatherz9 his new contract
[4:06:26] WonderinJoe: @JMatherz9
[4:06:26] DeanoTV: so weird, should just be like essences
[4:06:31] Korupcija_: F
[4:06:37] hennyc33: It’s a damn mobile game
[4:06:39] Avinar: I hope 10.0 is actually good and grand but the rule of "only every other xpac is good" scares me for it
[4:06:40] Eshel: Can’t get a god damn answer in this channel I swear
[4:06:48] Ezekyler: mobile game timegating KEKW
[4:06:56] Frostfury: Wait are you going Venthyr for raiding? @Towelliee
[4:07:00] Synoble: @gamingnoob102 Depends on what kind of Azeroth we come out to, given the time shift we are going to have
[4:07:01] Beantot127: what about switching your soulbind
[4:07:04] paintednpierced: @eshel Its a busy channel
[4:07:08] KatieGaming: @Eshel I dont think he knows...
[4:07:08] ZyntosAran: if you learn a conduit, you get an energy
[4:07:15] pedro9585: isnt it just adding any conduit gives you one
[4:07:16] ImperioFortisHD: Do conduits work like essences you just need to farm them once but you can also upgrade them? @Towelliee
[4:07:17] MOXP: @Eshel what did you ask?
[4:07:18] critin87: or a new one
[4:07:20] Tuppe: They can start selling Conduit energy in the shop 4Head
[4:07:21] manmower: this sounds a bit convoluted
[4:07:22] Shadowmental: can you have all three soulbinds
[4:07:24] Zimri_Nilo: Robeburn subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 16 months! 
[4:07:24] Moobot: @ROBEBURN with the 16 months re-sub! towHAMUP

[4:07:34] ZyntosAran: @Shadowmental one at a time
[4:07:42] darkiozzzz: Mobile game ?
[4:07:53] Caremachine: Towelliee dont you think this game isnt about community and relationships (like it was back in time) but about techniques that resemble mobile game marketing (keeping us busy and keep on-screen)?
[4:07:53] Shadowmental: ah ok, was wondering when you change specs how the conduits work
[4:07:53] Alliewh33lz: Alliewh33lz subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 24 months!

[4:07:55] manmower: what problem is this system solving?
[4:07:57] Beantot127: can you use a conduit in both soulbind
[4:07:57] DrSoosh: @eshel towelliee isnt their customer support chill tf out. contact gfuel

[4:08:23] MOXP: oh man ALL the systems are SO scuffed LUL it's insane to me tbh

[4:08:33] Moobot: @XHAVEN with the 21 months re-sub! towHAMUP
[4:08:39] PadidinJones: Its not terrible IMO just be careful in the beginning. Eventually they will implement a catchup mech to click away
[4:08:40] Eshel: @drsoosh Umm I did - but as a representative of their brand I thought he’d like to know and/or have some insight to how fast they respond
[4:08:40] ImperioFortisHD: Do conduits work like essences you just need to farm them once but you can also upgrade them? @Towelliee
[4:08:46] DeanoTV: so weird it should just be like essences

[4:09:07] Avinar: such an unnecessary and arbitrary road block LUL its not unmanageable but weird
[4:09:10] manmower: this seems like it just stops you from trying new things out
[4:09:10] Eshel: So get off my ass
[4:09:12] dalaraz: day 1 we have 10 energy or 0 ? @Towelliee

[4:11:08] Avinar: lol having to pick and choose
[4:11:09] manmower: they should make the the swap free during arena, like talents are
[4:11:13] Onertwitch: for that probably would be better to have 2 characters
[4:11:15] mo197: towRee
[4:11:16] LordKain73: None of this min/maxing bs, my Unholy is going Necrolords baby!

[4:12:07] ForklyftTV: @Towelliee do soulbind set ups change when you change specs?

[4:13:04] KingSlayerYotam: ill go kyrian for my prot pala, seems like the right choice for the class
[4:13:08] tbakm: people need to understand they can play whatever they want and still do great. it's only the 1% or less that need to worry about absolute min maxing
[4:13:08] superpudd: I raid CE and NF is barely behind Kierien for boomies so I'll be riding with them
[4:13:12] Zyii_: what is the best for a bear tank? I decided to main my guardian druid

[4:14:00] FattBeard: I've read most of the guides out there and they all say what is best for raids and M+ but I can't find any that say what's best for Torghast and just general play.

[4:14:05] dowden: ThatRoamingGamer no, just like with BFA the quest will just pop up for you in your questlog as soon as blizzard hits the switch
[4:14:06] KatieGaming: @Eshel You have to send them pictures and shit like 2 days after you get your product, and im assuming it takes a few days for them to respond. Towelliee can probably instantly get in touch with him, so his judgement on it will not be the same.
[4:14:07] Ewol66: No not at all @AveragePvp :)
[4:14:11] Audiodisaster: Imo, Level nNw for Anniversary 16% Exp Boost!

[4:14:19] KatieGaming: them*
[4:14:22] dalaraz: for balance though,if you ever wish to press n and play resto,night fae is the choice
[4:14:23] Angry__Samurai: Im gonna do hunter than a dk because plate armor is just superior
[4:14:29] mayer2911: night Fae will be best for my druid, for gold farming tmog in dungeons! <3
[4:14:35] instructOS: which covenant gives the wings?
[4:14:35] ChrisarN: What do you do when Blizzard balance them @Towelliee ?
[4:14:41] JustSoMediocre: Thanks @dowden
[4:14:53] Thoreya: max said last night things are really balanced from their testing
[4:14:55] NEROV3LO: Best Class coming into shadowlands?
[4:14:56] Frostfury: I will be with Kyrian as Prot Pally since I enjoy M+ also so it makes sense to choose will progressing Mythic since not in high end guilds doing WF anyway.
[4:15:04] Nvdeo: !song
[4:15:10] rudytc: god i love this lofi
[4:15:13] RealWarmaine: Wait you are saying they did more tuning since alpha? :P
[4:15:16] Avinar: some abilities just in general suck
[4:15:28] Barkerisonfire: Do you think they delay was the right amount of time or do you think it could have been longer?
[4:15:30] Angry__Samurai: Opinion on Venthyr for Huntrers? That Tmog looks so cool!!
[4:15:33] Arcazua: they nerfed kyrian so hard nightfae became the best
[4:15:42] fewyn: i think i've finally decided to do venthyr on my DK
[4:15:46] AveragePvp: @towelliee blizzard had me nervous at first with the balancing but yeah it seems like it’s pretty damn good right now
[4:15:47] D3ception: they crushed everything down to ground, thats why its more balanced now. Some abilities are even useless now
[4:15:49] Deviant404: now it looks like nightfae for everything
[4:15:50] dalaraz: they have night fae for everything in todays post @Towelliee
[4:15:50] Blvdman: fuck kyrian tbh i prayed my ele didnt have to go kyrian
[4:15:51] malonion: @Towelliee Which way did you go for Ret if you tried it?
[4:15:52] dowden: ThatRoamingGamer it'll ask you to first go to your factions capital tho before sending you to Icecrown, so might aswell just stay in Stormwind or OG
[4:15:52] superpudd: I need to decide weather or not to level as bear or boomie though
[4:15:59] MattyjTV: what are you thinking is good for Prot Pally?
[4:15:59] snuffles_80: why do they always over nerf stuff
[4:15:59] Mogwaimonk: "Fun Detected" (DELETE)
[4:16:06] Trinkiee: can you change the covenant you choose?
[4:16:08] KristineTheUnicorn: I'm gonna go Kyrian for my Resto Sham, even though it isn't bis c:
[4:16:08] Avinar: kyrian is Still good for hunters but competitive with night fae
[4:16:10] Ewol66: I can see them nerfing them and people having to switch
[4:16:11] Arcazua: no they nerfed kyrian and buffed nf to the point it became the best
[4:16:11] specialkidmiles: I just want a Bastian Pally Kreygasm
[4:16:18] Eshel: @katiegaming Look - I was just asking his input since he’s sponsored - as a face of a product he should probably know what he’s representing - I assure you I’ve already contacted G-Fuel - since nobody has constructive input I’m dropping it and just won’t use his code anymore if I ever buy from them again - problem solved
[4:16:20] Rytten: Did I make the right decision to know next to nothing about shadowlands?
[4:16:21] WonderinJoe: where can i read the changes on the conv? Im really curious
[4:16:30] GivTater: Stay hydrated friend. 1 more day!
[4:16:33] Frostfury: I mean Pelegos still kinda ok for Prot Pally since magic resist we are lack of but works same way as Versa
[4:16:35] jamesc398: imagine if they called a release delay later today
[4:16:36] Redpandalol: towelliee are you gonna be using azeroth auto pilot?
[4:16:38] Critizin: 2 dps pick venthyr, and most dps dont pick necrolord... its going to be insane trying to form a group around dungeon buffs.
[4:16:38] Mamalauu: Anyone know what one for resto sham?
[4:16:49] DehCantao: according to wowhead guide, kyrian is still the only good one for vdh
[4:16:52] Uhzova: @Towelliee what mounts are you still farming?
[4:16:54] ForklyftTV: @Towelliee do conduits changes when you activate different specs?
[4:16:55] KatieGaming: Yeah a sub was asking how long it takes them to get back with someone from customer support.
[4:16:58] Ezekyler: some customer service question @Towelliee

[4:17:24] jerexify: @Towelliee Just went through Exile's Reach. That's not a bad starting area at all! Less than 45 minutes to level 10, and a lot of fun.
[4:17:26] Bubbyyz: u expecting shadowlands to be great or a let down?
[4:17:37] KaotiK_X: What are you trying to get in Kara
[4:17:41] RaidsNBeers: Do you think shadowlands is gonna have a major launch problem or do you think blizzard might have been able to control it better this xpack ?

[6:55:05] Menisong: that would be a nice change
[6:55:14] wib0rg: what gfuel cans would you recommend ?
[6:55:16] tekfury: that would suck to play a class just to hit the boss and afk
[6:55:21] VoldoxTV: hahaha no theyre not
[6:55:24] NurseTrevor: How will WW monks be?
[6:55:25] Staksor: are they? I see a lot of whining from dps warriors
[6:55:26] KickAxe12: Do think prot warrior will be better later on>
[6:55:30] KaerusTTV: been debating about coming back. Anyone know how good rogues are? I assume good because they are always good Kappa

[6:56:53] Onertwitch: warriors are super strong for pvp prob 2nd best, rogue is prob best melee class for pvp
[6:56:56] Curmudgeon_Gamer: Just went to the Cavern of Time and everything, everything was dead! Even the guards. Nothing but skeletons !
[6:57:00] Wooninite: Warriors are always lower at the beginning of an expansion. Fury especially scales pretty hard with higher gear.
[6:57:04] Fa11ensDeath: Im a blood dk and the only thing i whine about is im to slow lol
[6:57:06] dkapocalypse: im a dk im not bitching

[6:59:04] Sin_GamingTV: @foxies_havocing Always good to have a backup plan
[6:59:08] Hidden_Citizen: Why no love for Enhancement shamans?

[7:05:25] laughing_octopus: dont *
[7:05:25] Luxthos: To be honest, people won't care, just like they didn't care about what Azerite Trait you had equipped. Sure you'll see "Need one Venthyr", but you won't get declined because you have the wrong covenant, it makes no fucking sense!

[7:06:29] Luxthos: Exactly, but the group title will be "Need 1 Necrolord", if you queue in that group and you're not Necrolord, that's an issue, but it's same thing for "looking for rogue" and you queue as a Warlock LUL

[7:09:06] CipansR_Ayaya: that mog XD
[7:09:07] Ravynaeous: But since he also pushes m+, toll is still looking the better option

[7:10:24] Luxthos: @danishviking90 They are all close enough for Death Knight, that it doesn't really matter to be honest!
[7:10:30] Jaymacibe: @Ravynaeous going to lvl as arms but want end game as prot
[7:10:32] Menisong: i dont really think they are toouching covanents after today until 1st tier is over

[7:11:47] Poriand: i like that ty
[7:11:48] dv_domino: @Poriand should switch right to SL

[7:12:21] XFrostyAssassinX: seems like Kyrian is the best for Warlock....
[7:12:24] Ravynaeous: @BeardedWolverine except theres like 2-3% diff between all the covenants for most specs now..they're getting closer to an actual balance
[7:12:25] Bubba_T_Baggin: Anyone else get The God King from 300 feels from the Jailer guy?

[7:13:14] dym_jt: Just wait, Venthyr is getting hammered eventually.
[7:13:17] Luxthos: Venthyr for Unholy is really good because of Theotar's Umbrella, but being 100% in that Mastery Umbrella is not realistic, that's why sims are a bit skewed!
[7:13:20] Luxthos: In my opinion!
[7:13:34] showmethesugar35: Its simple, its never gonna get balanced
[7:13:36] Deathryan: @Towelliee what is the best covenent for hpally?

[7:20:10] Bayne77: which one is the one where you chuck all of those avengers shields all over the place? that one.
[7:20:14] hoodvoker: @Towelliee I wish Necrolord Vanquisher hammer generated a HP charge.
