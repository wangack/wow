[1:04:49] Bowwjack: @Towelliee tbh i think they should just scrap the Private Auras thing and focus on making content actually playable without compuational weakauras and shitg like that but i think the encounter desginers just can't get out of their own way.
[1:05:07] twarnak: I call it the double whammy
[1:05:08] Nylle8: i can't seem to get any of them to show
[1:05:25] Speshulist: @Bowwjack I think private auras are good! They need to make easier mechanics with private auras.  That's what we thought we were getting
[1:05:59] shapebender: reapply rune
[1:06:25] amricatt: @Nylle8 You gotta apply to your armor, like enchants.
[1:06:53] roflpotamus: its ok because he drops a glowy axe Kappa
[1:07:04] Wheysted779: Private auras-good idea, bad in practice
[1:07:16] beerking2323: what is definition of private aura? is it something that each person is accountable inputting?
[1:07:17] Alsparq: this creates burnout
[1:07:22] snake_like: bro the mechanic visibility and weakaura/macro reliance this expansion has burned me the fuck out of raiding
[1:07:39] Wheysted779: echo of nelth was bad practice too

[4:47:08] King_Booo: in 2024 they are adding more planes onto the routes to japan so direct flights will be even more accessible
[4:47:12] HaxzorJimDuggan: it would actually be cheaper for me to fly to LAX from where i live and take a plane to japan
[4:47:16] HaxzorJimDuggan: but a huge pain in the ass
[4:47:24] Verdell263: I've been told turbulence will never take a plane down

[4:50:17] Verdell263: @Wcvechten Wait until there are flying cars. All the idiots driving will be flying
[4:50:23] Veegore: @Spinecloud yea, like spirit
[4:50:25] lastdeo: no haha
[4:50:36] DarthWrex: also the requirement to be a pilot and the maintenance of a plane are much stricter than cars
[4:50:38] Spinecloud: lets just say, they dont have the same regulations in uganda, u know what i mean
[4:50:40] glorygirl: it's because of how heavily reggulated they are here
[4:50:41] WoW_StandalonE: do u have a prenuptial agreement done? @Towelliee 4Head
[4:50:53] DarthWrex: hell in Texas next year you dont need a vehicle inspection anymore

[4:52:20] deanbeo: Can't fly high, messes with me to much lol
[4:52:32] gelimarr: how do you even get drugs on the plane lol
[4:52:38] trollinmyimp: Places like india and bangledesh have much less safety standards
[4:52:48] KroniclyLazy: You should have come out of the bathroom and asked if they remembered to bring a towel CD
[4:52:49] meganuskon: Ya that's in the game but just for Shamans!
[4:53:04] Hyelander_: Thats the original fire totem quest
[4:53:07] Veegore: it was always there. shaman had all their elemental quest, kind of like how druid had all their form quests
[4:53:08] ReactionsxD: The way I look at yes your more likely to get in an accident in a car then a plane but your not surviving that plane crash if it happens more then likely The way I look at yes your more likely to get in an accident in a car then a plane but your not surviving that plane crash if it happens more then likely

[5:08:06] Gromche: Shaman dual wield tank...
[5:08:06] riccarjo: Do you prefer SoD/Classic over retail?
[5:08:12] Veegore: i just want more druid race choices. like Earthen have to be able to be druid's right? with all rune bear type base forms?
[5:08:16] Pups_Gersky: I'm struggling as a Shammy tank. Mana issues are my main issue. I go oom so fast..
[5:08:21] 3663Sharad: sacrificing elemental as a specc would be a good trade off imo
[5:08:21] smashwow: didn't ion straight up say fuck support specs after they saw the data?

[5:09:50] allisonkielle: That's a terrible choice if they decide to have aug be the only support
[5:09:51] Colt_Engineer: yeah our 3rd dwarf race
[5:09:55] Wcvechten: Would be cool to have a new spec using guns and bow, as only  hunters use that, same for warglaive users
[5:10:03] CeruleanStar: maybe they do more supports but also make 6 person groups
