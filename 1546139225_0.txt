[1:22:24] RiskyBusines_ez: it just based on the hp as a scaling factor
[1:22:29] Pr1m0x21: Do it
[1:23:24] BoezIRL: probably a % of max health
[1:23:26] RiskyBusines_ez: this is the formua for Ignoring Pain cap "[(0 + Attack power * 3.5) * (1 + Versatility)]" - its just gonna look different now, because its based on hp
[1:23:30] Banjo586: isn't 30% buff on ignore pain just insane
[1:23:32] quentinkil: hi how are you big boy Towelliee
[1:23:47] mithel91: what do you say on nerves?
[1:24:05] Meeckah: Risky - it said the cap is increased so you can stack it to max hp - the formula just for a 30* increase but the cap is increased to max health
[1:24:08] Lostdogal: clarification - Ignore Pain’s absorption increased by 30%, and the absorption cap is now 30% of maximum Health (was twice the Ignore Pain absorb value)
[1:24:20] Scoodles91: @ZinarothMosberg not cool, not cool at all.. :D
[1:24:30] Lostdogal: yeah
[1:24:31] RiskyBusines_ez: @Meeckah thats no way what it says

[1:31:27] mavis316: @towelliee are you just interested in sports cards?
[1:31:30] griffdog125: Upper deck
[1:31:34] Bayne77: upper deck
[1:31:34] squishalan: in like 2000 i sold all my pokemon cards for $10 had a charizard in there
[1:31:34] CapNorge: CapNorge subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 37 months! 
[1:31:44] manmower: only cards packs with gum in them retain value

[1:34:42] officialviz: joey gallo is a clown
[1:34:48] mavis316: eBay is a very good place for cards.  Boxes, packs, or individual cards.
[1:34:49] M2thew: I have few Kobe Bryant autographs from 99 and 2000s
[1:34:52] Zinaroth: @Intikamcy Most likely getting that, Dracthyr and event in prepatch

[1:36:42] Zinaroth: @mavis316 Do you know what a full set of 151 first pokemon cards from when they were initially released would be worth?
[1:36:49] Kisswani: loving the mount
[1:36:53] manmower: hopefully that mount looks better in motion
[1:36:56] freetherocktv: @Towelliee hes the reason a 1st edition pokemon box is worth 500K its so fucking dumb
[1:36:59] Akermay: Wish it was the original house cat, not a saber
[1:37:04] jarilrpg: its in game now in collections @Towelliee
[1:37:04] btdubs1: that is dope
[1:37:05] Alepouditsa: i used to have from yu-gi-oh cards but i just burn them the were good paper for BBQ
[1:37:05] thymos_: blackish color wouldve been cooler
[1:37:08] mavis316: @zinarothmosberg it would depend a lot on condition
[1:37:13] bonkyouded: it looks awesome
[1:37:14] flebbooo: Real niiicee
[1:37:17] mehowski: yeah its sick
[1:37:20] manmower: that's for doing all fated mythic?

[1:37:25] Lasidor: but does it fllyyyyyyyyyyyyyy
[1:37:33] mashiesmashie: it looks much better than the concept art we were given
[1:37:34] squishalan: Awesome another non flying mount Kappa
[1:37:34] inj0shwetrust: Tbh thats wayyyy better than spect tiger
[1:37:35] Kisswani: @manmower all fated , could be normal
[1:37:35] freetherocktv: oh that looks awesome
[1:37:35] bonkyouded: only wish now we could get a red, purple and yellow one PoroSad
[1:37:44] manmower: only normal, nice
[1:37:48] inj0shwetrust: You gotta full clear the raids
[1:37:50] KaisenSiru: It has to be all bosses each Fated raid
[1:37:53] Meflown: doesnt matter, everyone is gonan using dragonriding mounts
[1:37:54] squishalan: Just make all mounts fly like ffxiv
[1:37:58] 91Niki: And this could’ve been free is y’all didn’t vote for that dumb tree towRee
[1:38:04] manmower: LFR is easier for people not in guilds
[1:38:05] thymos_: gate keepers would start crying
[1:38:08] Kisswani: I think they will relent and make it obtainable on LFR , the rage is real
[1:38:12] jarilrpg: @91Niki agreed
[1:38:20] rohdey: normal w/ echo
[1:38:22] pavepawns: sometimes lfr is harder cause ppl
[1:38:22] Alepouditsa: @91Niki it is ungly tho
[1:38:22] Buckwink: there are people who only do lfr though
[1:38:23] Kakotan2143: Tree is cool :P
[1:38:27] manmower: it's sort of a reward for sticking it out with the xpac till the end
[1:38:42] rohdey: so? we wpi;d
[1:38:46] unreal1357: lfr is more of a convenience for the casuals, they are not going to remove that now
[1:38:56] 91Niki: I don’t see the problem Kappa
[1:39:00] mavis316: @zinarothmosberg it’s honestly the difference in a 5k set and a 100k set.  Older cards all revolve around condition.
[1:39:13] Kisswani: if only trees can fly Kappa
[1:39:35] Se7enthSinn: get rid of LFR? lol, not everyone have the time to play wow hardcore
[1:39:43] Alepouditsa: i like mounts like the ones the had in arndewild(or how it is spell) danCute
[1:39:45] Molvonos: You'd swear Blizz was attempting to get people into guilds/communities to do group content rather than solo-queing into things. towNod
[1:39:47] Zinaroth: @mavis316 They have been siting in a binder in plastic pockets in an attic for 20 years. I don't know what the condition is but aren't there also like different versions etc?

[1:41:33] Se7enthSinn: @ceranac23 it normal isnt hardcore but not everyone have the time to put a raid together and run it.
[1:41:38] thymos_: Garrosh did right when he nuked the alliance EZ
[1:41:41] pavepawns: it means u can swap targets if one dies
[1:41:43] BoezIRL: target dies you have still stack
[1:41:44] rohdey: bloodmallet says it's low throughput
[1:41:47] mavis316: @zinarothmosberg the older cards I think only had holo versions.  Also look on the cards if you see a 1st on it, it was a first edition and worth more.
[1:42:11] Zinaroth: @mavis316 Holo being the ones that glitter?
[1:42:16] bonkyouded: you know what would be cool, if warriors get a talent that refrence to Garrosh FeelsBadMan

[1:43:14] scumlucki: I  have that trinket and it its fucking ass
[1:43:17] Se7enthSinn: people that have a the time to play forget about the others that have families and jobs. that's why LFR was put into place.
[1:43:21] Deadelus0: Indeed
[1:43:25] mavis316: It should be somewhere under the picture if I remember right.  I haven’t dealt with old Pokémon cards in a few years.

[1:44:21] ceranac23: just remove negative stuff and its big :)
[1:44:22] Molvonos: Only reason I have it on my lock is for the class fantasy of killing myself like back in Vanilla.
[1:44:31] Horuseternal69: it's a great trinket when your at 4 stacks outside of that it's shite lol
[1:44:37] deeebag: @se7enthsinn thats fine man.  dont want to join a guild to do the content or dont have the time to then you're not getting the rewards for it
[1:44:54] kw3nk: HUH? you only need 2k rating for the mount next season???
[1:45:00] Molvonos: These got done dirty
[1:45:16] ceranac23: @kw3nk ye there is no 10 dungeons 8 again
[1:45:21] Lasidor: Was that Taregosa? lol
[1:45:26] KaisenSiru: @kw3nk Because there are only 8 dungeons in the pool now, vs the 10 we have now in S3
[1:45:28] jrossino: Has to be a proto

[1:47:30] ceranac23: @luckfore they say u will have like 4 zereth mort  every zone have some kind of progression system with no pllayer power only for cosmetic and stuff
[1:47:35] JefeRyujyn: Bonk tail
[1:47:42] FrittenPerson: @luckfore tbh we never really had a concrete idea of what end game is looking like other than WQs and they were already confirmed
[1:47:43] mavis316: @towelliee were you ever into Pokémon or Magic?  Or were you just sports?
[1:47:45] pnavara: casual content, who will ever be flying with this since people unlock teleports and wormhole toy
[1:47:46] BoezIRL: iconic tail
[1:48:07] DDarkblu: they will, just not yet
[1:48:25] luckfore: @FrittenPerson that would suck, i cba doing wq's anymore especially if they are like Shadowlands wqs
[1:48:28] AureliusXV: why whats the point
[1:48:33] Se7enthSinn: @deeebag I've been playing wow since day one. I have a GM Hunter running around Zereth Mortis collecting Sandworm relics, because I love the game but dont have the time anymore. I do LFR weekly
[1:48:47] unreal1357: there wasnt much more end game content from classic until wotlk and they was very popular, do you not think what we have now is enough rather than something gridny and time gated like the past few expacs?
[1:48:48] Funderik: i see them eventually just giving it to all mounts.
[1:48:52] bonkyouded: thinking of actually just dragonfly through azeroth POGGERS
[1:49:00] DDarkblu: could allow them to rework so old zones to accommodate for it though which would be cool :)
[1:49:13] manmower: i want a giant hole to the center of the earth i can fly down, perhaps after they remove the big sword
[1:49:25] pnavara: i dont remember last  time i was in orgrimmar and you talking about westfall xd
[1:49:33] nosfreeze: it would make my trip from UC to strat for the mount farm so much faster tho xD
[1:49:42] venom366: just do it in old wow @Towelliee as a dragon Kappa
[1:49:43] DDarkblu: that's true man
[1:49:46] FrittenPerson: nobody does
[1:49:47] Mr_Pennywise_: D:
[1:49:47] KillchainGames: bring on wow 2
[1:49:47] KaisenSiru: YEP
[1:49:48] Funderik: new shit > reworking old shit
[1:49:50] bonkyouded: just put the expansion after DF in the old zones
[1:49:55] TIny_Rrick: we know this expansion is going to blow.... this much hype on a riding skill.... we are fucked
[1:49:56] BJofBorg: As someone with motility problems, I am worried I won't be able to do dragonriding
[1:50:08] Molvonos: @TIny_Rrick ???? That's your take?
[1:50:11] Lasidor: @TIny_Rrick This is an absurdly hot take lol
[1:50:13] Razzin_: thats why flying is awesome in GW2, because the zones are huge, vertically and horizontally
[1:50:13] Uguntinsh: Stunlocked towel, out no.
[1:50:21] OviTheGray: collect pets :)
[1:50:25] luckfore: thats how i feel about classic
[1:50:36] bonkyouded: didn't even mention the barrens... PepoDance
[1:50:38] ashnmsr: remake in higher res/graphics + redoing it easy
[1:50:47] FrittenPerson: @Lasidor Trolls gonna troll...
[1:50:51] Wolfenhoof: i was there a thousand times as well, but i am still more sick of shadowlands than i am of the barrens^^
[1:50:53] Funderik: that would cost us a couple expansions, not raid tiers.
[1:50:54] Finansdepartementet: I dont think they need to redo the old zones, but i do think they need to make the old zones more relevant
[1:50:58] venom366: gachiHYPER
[1:50:58] cruzeal: lol
[1:50:59] abracka_: it's time for ERP BDSM in wow baby

[2:09:37] manmower: is this like Sonic or Mario?

[2:15:08] Sollice: And I was blasting.....
[2:15:08] apollobaker: imagine how the bad the other classes are atm, if they release paladin in this state
[2:15:10] ollebajs1: hi Towelliee, my friend recently got diagnosed with cancer and he watches your streams alot, could you help me make his day by maybe having a little text with his name in the corner of your stream? His name is Alghammare btw  <3
[2:15:42] ArcaneSyntax: dragon riding is significantly faster than regular flying
[2:15:50] Affiiance: I need them to make a 2 person dragon riding mount available at launch so me and my wife can level together
[2:15:52] ZhortWoW: @Towelliee How does paladin feel on the alpoha so far? Wish i had access to get a feeling for it myself.
[2:15:55] Berkilak: Even if dragonriding is faster in these huge zones, you'd prefer normal flying?
[2:16:01] Miertez: pretty random i love it tho
[2:16:12] ZhortWoW: ZhortWoW subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 5 months, currently on a 2 month streak! How does paladin feel on the alpoha so far? Wish i had access to get a feeling for it myself.

[2:16:25] Fappy23: lmao
[2:16:27] 91Niki: @Partizangaming I'm just trying to make logic out of your sentence. If you say that it will be dead after the next exp comes out, then you're saying there is no point to making anything at all. You're the one who said it, not me towHeh
[2:16:31] KydSage: KEKL he said wassup bruh
[2:16:43] Razzin_: being Tauren probably doesnt help
[2:16:50] krayaal: what if you would get some cool dragonriding skill for your normal mount that you could use everywhere in WoW at the end of expansion 10
[2:16:58] The_Dane_Train: Cool treehouse.

[2:17:14] fewyn: maybe some kind of secret puzzle thing?
[2:17:15] 91Niki: @Partizangaming Nothing to do with defending the game. I'm just telling you that what you're saying has no logic behind it LUL

[2:17:58] Funderik: 3m CD
[2:17:59] abracka_: i think it's supposed to be reusable
[2:18:01] abracka_: might be a buyg
[2:18:04] LSBreed: probably Incase your dragon runs out of juice mid flight.
[2:18:08] love_eggplant: @91Niki your emote game is on point lol
[2:18:09] sqknarf: 3m cooldown looks reusable
[2:18:11] kjdocs: Could help you in those moments when you don't completly dragon ride to your destination.  If you at least land high enough.

[2:20:03] Cafe0le: LUL
[2:20:05] CritcobainTV: yeah the wording on it made me think it was reusable, but maybe it was just telling u the cd it shares with regular gliders i dunno
[2:20:14] manmower: world pvp?
[2:20:15] Thoreya: pvp zones pog
[2:20:29] instant_savage: places to turn on warmode maybe
[2:20:33] Thoreya: maybe legion pvp stuff
[2:20:34] backstreetalright: I like how sustainability is a concern making reusable stuff
[2:20:41] UtherBrexton: towers like legion?
[2:20:53] manmower: i hope they put all the best ores and herbs in the pvp zone
[2:21:25] Baishall: waiting for vigor seems kindof painful

[2:22:24] Rottencoarse: did we do the mage/ret overview guys?
[2:22:25] loutre_malgache: PvPers : We don't want to be forced to do PvE to enjoy the game. Also PvPers : Let's put the best ressources in PvP zones !
[2:22:30] exilethegamer: Blizzard had the audacity to lock behind some of the best looking artifact appearances behind pvp
[2:22:31] Naturalbeef: Even better, put the crafting tables in a PvP zone
[2:22:33] KydSage: they made warmode and no one barely does that anymore besides for more xp for leveling LUL
[2:22:36] ijuki: I like to gank lowbies like the rest of the pvpers in WoW towCopium
[2:22:37] CritcobainTV: is it to your right? that big tower
[2:22:38] Sollice: I was going to start playing my warrior this weekend but ultimately is it pointless if on Tuesday gear ilvls are going to go up for doing the same thing?
[2:22:39] JasperXIII: I wanna come back to wow buts its tough with retail little overwhelmed with it
[2:22:50] ollebajs1: hi Towelliee, my friend recently got diagnosed with cancer and he watches your streams alot, could you help me make his day by maybe having a little text with his name in the corner of your stream? His name is Alghammare btw  <3

[3:19:58] TheStank1990: emp crusade for the divine storm buff
[3:20:06] mabexo: Guys How are ret talents looking? Good or bad or in between give me tl:dr
[3:20:08] thijsjuuhhhh: Are the paladin buffs out now or will they come in Season 4?
[3:20:15] Puns_Blazing: exorcism is good for aoe too @Towelliee
[3:20:21] TheStank1990: since storm is causing bonus consecrate dmg
[3:20:33] 91Niki: Slong of the law
[3:20:39] kappaday23: Kappa
[3:20:41] scumlucki: Long AWM

[3:21:02] Diamondead1: exorcism PogChamp
[3:21:03] scumlucki: jesus
[3:21:05] Zilberg: That's insane POGGERS
[3:21:09] Deadelus0: woah :o
[3:21:15] BfAleTitan: just the dot though, so less insane than possible
[3:21:17] Garoxxar: they trying to make Pallys the new fucking DH
[3:21:20] kharditv: lil John PogChamp
[3:21:22] smashwow: if they're inside the conc
[3:21:29] ijuki: Paladins are back on the menu bois POGGERS
[3:21:32] tornbraclet: didnt they have that back in Mop?
[3:21:37] silodin: Was that a lil' jonh impression?
[3:21:40] Garoxxar: YOU GET AN AOE, YOU GET AN AOE, EVERYONE GETS AN AOE
[3:21:44] silodin: WHAT?! OKAY?! YEAHAH!
[3:21:44] Zilberg: Well if you must get extra holy power MiniK
[3:22:06] BfAleTitan: unfortunately ret is still stuck with either doing AoE or single target and hasn't fixed its primary issue
[3:22:06] kulriko: exe's will is sick
[3:22:25] oradros: ret pally are like TIME BROTHER TO PURGE HERESY
[3:22:38] ashwing_: Yet LUL
[3:22:39] smashwow: just wait they're coming
[3:22:45] whyabadi: same as hunter then (not)
[3:22:52] Zilberg: Ret pally's are gonna be the goats in Mythic+
[3:22:55] paragon_3: that seems like a massive balance issue
[3:22:56] Garoxxar: watch, last 4 are going to be like 5
[3:22:56] thebakeriscomingforu: With some of the talent trees they will just need some tweeking.
[3:23:10] thebakeriscomingforu: Prot paladin needs an overhaul
[3:23:15] ashwing_: Yeah but even with 1 point the tree has so many cool talents you still cant pick all
[3:23:15] mrabs0lute: that because half of them up top should have been baseline
[3:23:31] KaisenSiru: Tempest a must for dungeons
[3:23:33] smashwow: to get to the good capstones you're out 4 points. not as bad as a mage but doesn't feel great
[3:23:35] Zilberg: More aoe POGGERS
[3:23:36] BfAleTitan: current AoE leggo
[3:23:37] LeGoogs: @Towelliee Have you been watching The Captain documentary?
[3:23:38] Gezber: yea
[3:23:39] oradros: quinn probably ordering shit load of lube
[3:23:44] Aspectt10: Leggo and legion artifact
[3:23:50] kulriko: nobody likes this spell tbh
[3:23:54] raye_gaming22: ligeon artefact and now a lego yea
[3:23:58] kulriko: no idea why they keep putting it on trees
[3:24:19] Zilberg: For sure
[3:24:21] Shrapnel_Sponge: ret tree is a little too focused, you have to focus too much on SGT or AoE and let's face it, ret is more of an add peel than a full sgt smasher
[3:24:24] bissoRM: Execute
[3:24:28] Zilberg: Divine storm = more aoe with that
[3:24:40] Zilberg: And execution
[3:24:46] Rictamar: I've not seen any pallys taking the 2% haste node at the top of the tree, not worth it
[3:24:59] Shrapnel_Sponge: and I hope that horse talents get put into less points, 5 for horse is mad.
[3:25:06] KaisenSiru: Yeah, judgement debuff on more enemies, more aoe
[3:25:29] house573: asmon cleaned his room
[3:25:42] ArcaneSyntax: you want long arm
[3:25:49] Dolas08: zeal for attack speed to proc wake is the way
[3:25:51] Templexx: lmao
[3:25:56] ArcaneSyntax: it's movement
[3:26:10] ArcaneSyntax: and ret needs movement
[3:26:15] Vandristine: long arm needs to have slightly more speed but i think it can be good, since paladin is slow
[3:26:19] ziko713: zeal for more auto procs
[3:26:25] Shrapnel_Sponge: @ArcaneSyntax and not spending 5 points on the damn horse
[3:26:28] Lorilath: toll and crusade and reckoning is possible
[3:26:38] Zilberg: So selfless healer?
[3:26:56] 블루치즈맨: grab divine toll PogChamp
[3:27:08] abracka_: grass? never heard of it
[3:27:22] Deadelus0: what is this "grass" he talks about?
[3:27:24] Shrapnel_Sponge: i find ret had to make too many choices of 'hybrid tax' taking utility over dps so it makes you selfish
[3:27:26] kharditv: ret meta for DF
[3:27:34] UntraceableBG: divine toll not working
[3:27:39] RiptoreCA: That Ret graphic in the talent tree is POGGERS
[3:27:49] cruzeal: i got some sun once didn't care for it
[3:27:52] Zilberg: Good.. Be a selfish character LUL
[3:28:01] Zilberg: Like every other class
[3:28:09] Shrapnel_Sponge: @Zilberg so basically everything a paladin is not supposed to be? got it LUL
[3:28:34] Shrapnel_Sponge: @Zilberg shamans don't have to choose, they have utility options through the class, it's a much better tree
[3:28:37] Zilberg: Nice guys finish last just like ret in Shadowlands
[3:29:03] cruzeal: i have a friend that's ret in shadowlands he slaps

[3:29:47] Sollice: I hate looking for sandworm chests

[3:34:00] Mitchendo64: Im glad they brought back concept art for the talent tree background
[3:35:24] kashmara: This music always takes me back.
[3:36:04] Jaren475: Elwynn Forest yes
[3:36:15] tothemoon30: anyone else could go for some flap jacks?
[3:36:15] Jaren475: depending on how long ago you posted
[3:36:16] mrsuflakis: Dota
[3:36:48] 91Niki: Flap jacks are amazing
[3:37:45] 91Niki: But for now I'm gonna do jumping jacks sacBLANKIES
[3:38:08] HaxzorJimDuggan: i want to go to blizzcon again just to visit rosco chicken and waffles again
[3:38:14] kashmara: I'll leave those to you. my damn back can't handle a jumping jack lol
[3:38:36] Tia214: pets am i right <3
[3:38:38] 91Niki: @HaxzorJimDuggan I went there in 2017. I only had waffles. Cuz chicken on waffles is such a weird concept to me LUL
[3:38:44] HoffaFiles: Rosco's if def a great reason to go back, love that place
[3:38:52] Shaele: 666660 Anima channel points. Noice.
[3:38:53] HaxzorJimDuggan: it works so well
[3:39:06] BoezIRL: i would go left side for aoe

[3:39:12] ArcaneSyntax: you want the wake reset talent off of wake of ashes btw.
[3:39:17] ChaoticPriest: I even worked in a blue cheese factory in Wisconsin. You're not exactly wrong. I fucking love cheese. LUL
[3:39:17] Tia214: my cat ate my pepper jack cheese xD
[3:39:19] Holysal: @HaxzorJimDuggan I thought the same and then tried it. It was so good
[3:39:26] Rexialiton: Morning Towelliee and chat towLove
[3:39:37] HoffaFiles: I was at the Roscoe's in Hollywood, and saw GZA from Wu-Tang eating across from me lol
[3:39:43] Velashen: I can go for some blue cheese if it is with a hot wing :)
[3:39:48] BoezIRL: for the final i mean
[3:39:48] 91Niki: @Holysal I'll have to try it at some point
[3:40:05] Cojoha: i could go for a Popeye's chicken sandwich right about now
[3:40:14] Cojoha: or some Arby's
[3:40:25] falldrgn: now im hungry
[3:40:31] Zilberg: I kinda want some taco belll
[3:40:33] Cojoha: beef n cheedar with arby's sauce and curly fries
[3:40:37] Cojoha: and cherry turnover
[3:40:41] Darwoo: taco bell nasty
[3:40:41] mrmanno14: yup
[3:40:45] abracka_: that's like the tier for current content
[3:40:46] KaisenSiru: Yeah, its the tier 2 bonus
[3:40:46] qtla: 2 sec is short
[3:40:49] dimofodi: It's Ret current 4pc
[3:40:50] Darwoo: recently come to UK
[3:40:53] tejemias: Its like the set bonus
[3:40:54] dimofodi: er 2pc
[3:41:02] Evcon_: its long time for me
[3:41:03] ArcaneSyntax: @Towelliee now imagine you have the wake reset on art of war
[3:41:06] Cojoha: yeah it goes to 4 sec
[3:41:08] mrsuflakis: like 1 global
[3:41:08] Vandristine: 4 seconds on rank 2, still feels kinda short
[3:41:09] KaisenSiru: 4seconds with 2 points in
[3:41:10] manmower: it's powerful
[3:41:11] KaisenSiru: Its big
[3:41:12] mahz: 4 on live
[3:41:13] amricatt: Taco Bell is nasty but that's why we love it.
[3:41:16] tejemias: its 2 peace
[3:41:38] Zilberg: Do all the crit stuff stack?
[3:41:53] falldrgn: Towliee on the curse forge app splash page..
[3:42:03] kulriko: yeah it's a leggo
[3:42:19] falldrgn: close and re open
[3:42:21] silodin: that's you!
[3:42:27] falldrgn: Yeah I think so
[3:42:32] fuhnk323: you were so skinny
[3:42:39] eaglerydr: Yes
[3:42:54] Dathas487: This tree needs some triage in iteration honestly
[3:42:56] fuhnk323: big poppa is much better
[3:42:57] Murry07: exactly
[3:43:11] Zilberg: They ran out of ideas
[3:43:14] Evcon_: prot feels like a huge regression
[3:43:15] Trombol97: same with feral
[3:43:16] Holysal: bc they need to fill spots in the tree
[3:43:16] ZuggSpeedman: I hate that they made it a 3 min cd so you had to spend a point to bring it back down to 2
[3:43:17] Zilberg: Yeah exactly LUL
[3:43:20] Mojohusk: That's exactly it
[3:43:22] Scoodles91: feral is the same....
[3:43:23] Araphas: I think more abilities should be baseline and have talents modify them
[3:43:26] manmower: it's just there until they come up with something better
[3:43:30] Dathas487: They just need to add more utility choices and bake the damage into the class itself and boom, viable
[3:43:32] Evcon_: we have to spend so many points just to get to where we are now
[3:43:33] Tanker01: that is the whole "new" system in dragonflight... every spell is removed and you need to specc it.. totaly fu.. up.. look at the other classes
[3:43:37] OmgItsEdizzle: MeAnInGfUl ChOiCe
[3:43:40] ZuggSpeedman: crusade was a talent tbf
[3:43:42] Dathas487: utility as in to a group
[3:43:43] Zilberg: Why do they make points for the horsie?
[3:43:47] manmower: they gotta balance 1 talent point against another 1 talent point
[3:43:52] Tanker01: instead of creating new skills, they removing everything and granting this "brand new skill tree".. so sad
[3:43:54] Damingo54: This tree sucks
[3:43:56] dehash1: at the end of the day, theres not really anything new in these talents, just old stuff
[3:44:09] Nauti_: They need to make more customization and bring power levels down. You can't have all the borrowed power then just give it directly to everyone. It allows them to tinker and tune to finer degree.
[3:44:09] Moobot: Plans for WOTLK LAUNCH! Marathon from Sept 26th - October 1st! This won't be like TBC Launch. Since this launches around DF Beta and DF Launch. We will still no life it and get Pre-Raid BiS. I AM PLAYING ON FRESH!
[3:44:11] Cojoha: We need a teleport or charge for movement and a better defensive other than SoV
[3:44:19] sqknarf: the old saying, you think you do but you dont. we wanted talent trees but they just took stuff we already had and threw them in there. its nice to see trees again but not this way.
[3:44:22] Dathas487: That's not new
[3:44:23] ArcaneSyntax: no, it's just good
[3:44:27] KaisenSiru: Yeah you want FR. Its a new ability
[3:44:29] BoezIRL: nope
[3:44:31] wigglinjigglin: Current ability
[3:44:32] kulriko: path of ruin is 15
[3:44:35] UntraceableBG: it was 45 sec
[3:44:36] dimofodi: It was part of the 1 minute build from the 9.0 and 9.2
[3:44:37] ZuggSpeedman: final reck also was a talent but it competed with crusade I believe
[3:44:38] KaisenSiru: You talented into path of Ruin
[3:44:39] Murry07: Path of Ruin is 15 sec
[3:44:42] Daarksyde: was 30-45 i thought
[3:44:42] dimofodi: er 9.0 and 9.1
[3:44:42] rohdey: isn't it 40s in retail?
[3:44:46] Tomaterrs: it cost hp i think
[3:44:47] dimofodi: i cant type today
[3:44:49] Dathas487: It still is a talent, it's at the bottom of the tier
[3:44:50] wigglinjigglin: It’s solid in pvp
[3:44:52] kulriko: a bug probably then
[3:44:58] ArcaneSyntax: you don't really want path of ruin tbh
[3:45:00] Odindeld: Odindeld subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 7 months! 
[3:45:07] Zilberg: KEKW
[3:45:14] ArcaneSyntax: you want the wake reset, because its real good
[3:45:17] Vandristine: bugged maybe, thinks you still have path of ruin maybe
[3:45:17] kulriko: just a tooltip bvug
[3:45:19] kulriko: bug*
[3:45:20] duffluv22: duffluv22 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 20 months! 
[3:45:30] Zilberg: Check the cd on your bar?
[3:45:37] Zilberg: Maybe its a visual bug
[3:46:13] Vandristine: where are my Seals Kappa
[3:46:14] ZuggSpeedman: they added some good Legos and conduits back as talents which is nice but making you have to spend a bunch of points to get baseline wings back sucks
[3:46:21] Tanker01: thats the reason why i NEED to play the new class.. it doesnt feel like: hey they removed 5 spells from your specc
[3:46:43] dimofodi: in SL as ret consecrate is used when you have no other button to hit, these builds are looking to bring it back
[3:46:46] Snabido: @Tanker01 Need is a pretty strong word
[3:46:52] PigPenLen: policy perks, get somethin for doing nothing!
[3:46:57] dyslexican1: I kinda like that tbh. I always felt like there was so much more they could do with con, for ret.

[3:48:14] JStevenson: do you have to max the points out before you go down?
[3:48:23] kulriko: divine toll is kinda bland on st now
[3:48:27] dimofodi: @BoNE_22 There's Divine Toll in Prot also
[3:48:31] ZuggSpeedman: ohhhh true

[3:52:00] ZuggSpeedman: if you go full consecrate build it might be worth
[3:52:05] Scoodles91: 0.3 is better then 0.0
[3:52:09] KaisenSiru: With two consecrations down it likely will be slightly more
[3:52:10] ZuggSpeedman: sanctified is really strong
[3:52:22] Coriollis: mad paragon works best with crusade
[3:52:30] ArcaneSyntax: ret also has holy damage scaling from mastery, so it might be more
[3:52:34] berserker_strike: go sanc
[3:52:36] TheCJrose1234: woah these new talents look awesome
[3:53:00] instant_savage: final reckoning isnt btw last tier talent atm in live

[3:53:29] ArcaneSyntax: a couple of new ones like exorcism
[3:53:30] Zilberg: Warrior talent tree next week maybe?
[3:53:31] Nollychi: I've been playing ret on alpha and it feels a lot better than on live.
[3:53:33] Vandristine: Ret players needing to hit more than 5 buttons scares them inherently. i would know i mained it before Shadowlands
[3:53:44] BoezIRL: lot of cd
[3:53:54] ArcaneSyntax: listen I play enhance so this is a manageable amount of buttons

[3:58:57] Garoxxar: faceroll class
[3:59:02] winchez_: is it because theres only 4 targets will it give 5 for 5 enemies?
[3:59:04] Zeppyy: Hopefully they get rid of Ret Aura, or change it.. something.
[3:59:08] raye_gaming22: maybe wrath ret but not SL and DF
[3:59:08] BoezIRL: towelliee going ret in df confirmed
[3:59:09] Hadog32: nothing simple about ret.. way many buttons

[3:59:24] Dankind64: F
[3:59:36] Lostdogal: played ret through BFA, didn't touch it through shadowlands as it was an alt, fingers crossed the new xpac is actually alt friendly as it was a fun spec.

[3:59:59] Zilberg: Imagine if that cd was actually 15 seconds KEKW
[4:00:01] berserker_strike: u overcap hp
[4:00:03] KaisenSiru: You would want to Reck when you're at full holy power to spend more into the 8 second window
[4:00:08] mwchaos: you fit everything in that window
[4:00:09] BfAleTitan: going to want to divine toll then spend so you don't HP cap with ashes
[4:00:17] OGperky: How is prot feeling rn better or worse
[4:00:49] kulriko: final reckoning increases holy damage afaik
[4:01:01] Zilberg: It's over 9000!
[4:01:07] Coriollis: I expect them to nerf the generator
[4:01:08] BfAleTitan: does exorcism generate too?
[4:01:10] LeDerpski: You keep skipping exorcism
[4:01:21] kulriko: exorcism doesn't generate but it hits really hard
[4:01:22] KaisenSiru: Even more when spec'd into Liadrin's during wings brrrrr
[4:01:24] Zilberg: Curious to see how its gonna be in dungeon aoe

[4:01:46] DiiscoViking: have to throw in a heal now and then
[4:01:53] onous_: Towelliee is going to be the reason Blizzard nerfs ret into the ground.
[4:01:55] ArcaneSyntax: I LOVE the design of final reckoning
[4:01:56] BfAleTitan: hmm maybe the ret dream is still alive....
[4:01:59] kylinsky: loving the new enhancement paladin
[4:02:02] SmallzzIV: this is making we want to play pally
[4:02:18] racketpunch: do you think you're capped too often with holy power that you're losing dps since you're not spending fast enough?
[4:02:19] ArcaneSyntax: I'm 100% here for making ret as fast as enhancement
[4:02:28] Zilberg: Ret has been so bad.. Lets just keep it like this LUL

[4:04:13] jwt55: Towellie there is someone standing behind you
[4:04:15] Lorilath: looks to be 1 per 10s ish
[4:04:19] mwchaos: so same proc rate as the 1 every 10s
[4:04:21] raldrik: will it proc more if you have more mobs in their conc
[4:04:29] mwchaos: thatd be pretty cool if it does
[4:04:36] Dankind64: unless there's a weird internal CD
[4:05:05] arturiuss44: Considering we are 15th in dps according to dps check on wowhead they need to keep it close to this and not do what they usually do every expansion.  Make it fun and competitive then nerf it into ground and claim it is because we are a hybrid spec.
[4:05:17] Zilberg: Imagine LUL
[4:05:31] Zilberg: Pulling 20 mobs and its just holy power for everyone
[4:05:45] pigzip: @towelliee sense you are not use exorcism can u unspec and use the point somewhere else
[4:05:55] Strex03: all ret needs now is a raid buff
[4:06:12] JellonaCub: maybe keybind pot to wings?

[4:06:41] Zilberg: 10 minute mark monkaS
[4:07:02] ArcaneSyntax: it might be PPM or something
[4:07:37] manmower: sounds strong
[4:07:47] whyabadi: Does it trigger if no target is hit?
[4:08:00] KaisenSiru: Could be more when you have your second consecration down from the Blade procs
[4:08:08] Angeius90: Have you tried out Warrior yet?
[4:08:19] RocketMan23: so if thats the case why would you ever take the consecration version over inner power since its about the same ppm but you dont have to worry about consecration
[4:08:23] Exray2: That does not seem worth considering you have to waste globals on consecration and the target has to stay in it
[4:08:27] Manabucho: Have you seen the Maximum talk about paladins with narcolise naowh etc??
[4:08:44] MindGames_187: the other choice is is 1 every 10 secs right? so about the same
[4:08:52] RocketMan23: inner power is just a better choice

[4:12:15] Cojoha: well on live consecration only does 155 dmg per tick and im 275 ilvl
[4:12:17] silodin: ret is top 10 melee dps

[4:12:35] Korupcija_: when they nerf lock and hunter then every class will look good
[4:12:37] ArcaneSyntax: ret is not bad in m+ or raid lmao
[4:12:37] strike879: ret is lacking in invites
[4:12:40] kulriko: it's decent in m+, but they are competing with other strong melee options
[4:12:40] rhsiuol: like every non ww class
[4:12:42] Rumhammer: ret has bad mobility
[4:12:43] br3z: with jailer weap  they can smash but most of them do like 11k overall in a key
[4:12:52] kulriko: also in raid they don't bring anything that holy/prot already can bring
[4:12:52] bachooga: bachooga subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 49 months! 
[4:12:55] Cosmolus: ret is not fine . ret is dogshit except for pvp
[4:12:56] Dolas08: i did 20k in 20 gambit, ret not so bad
[4:13:10] D1Chile: @Towelliee  ret is just  very  either ur aoe spec or st spec no in between
[4:13:10] kulriko: so they spot in raid depends only on how much damage they do if you would want to optimise your comp
[4:13:15] Zilberg: Ret is garbage in M+.. People are on copium for ret

[4:16:20] br3z: yeah who woulda thought that having some form of interaction with your other spells would be a good thing??
[4:16:21] ArcaneSyntax: @hasan666 ret's good now

[4:16:29] boomerang101: ret was nerfd bad during legion never been same since
[4:16:31] Banjo586: the list lacks nuance
[4:16:34] Zilberg: Ret's good now... Okay LUL
[4:16:54] Korupcija_: all warlock logs are padding
[4:16:55] LordGumper: do you have a pre-patch date prediction?
[4:17:01] kulriko: ret was decent in progression when they had the old ret aura and maybe blessing of wisdom
[4:17:04] ArcaneSyntax: it is, it's good, it's not the best, but it doesn't have to be
[4:17:09] ashwing_: KEKW
[4:17:09] Llamatude: most of your highest ret parsers got CE and moved to other classes
[4:17:09] Molvonos: 'Sorry Ret.Pally, that PI was for the warlock.  misclick, dont get used to it'
[4:17:10] kulriko: now it's literally why would you play ret when you can be holy
[4:17:10] winchez_: i mean if ret was top tier then the paladin haters would be in an uproar
[4:17:12] Tia214: plus that list is bases off warcraftlogs isnt it towNod
[4:17:23] net_mi: Peak ret was during wotlk, been nerfed ever since

[4:18:15] Spikeel: @Towelliee  WotLK was our expansion <3
[4:18:15] ZuggSpeedman: I'm glad they brought exorcism back tho
[4:18:16] aizensouzukee: It is my belief that if your not in the 1 %, you can make every dps work. This Meta nonsense is not realistic for most Players
[4:18:20] magakigr: wrath and legion were good for palas
[4:18:24] strike879: you could press your abilities like a shopping list and do top dps
[4:18:34] stabzmcgeee: @Tia214 you mean the sit that reports exactly how specs are performing in raid by anyone who logs,, what else would you base a specs performance on?
[4:18:34] boomerang101: dont agree beginning of legion was good
[4:18:45] ZuggSpeedman: yea it's sick
[4:18:47] Coriollis: legion s2 till tomb was good , than they got nerfed hard
[4:18:48] SilkeySmooth: isnt legion when you did a paladin sit in?
[4:18:49] manmower: paladins are good right now in retail
[4:18:59] Zilberg: I just want Frost dk tanks back
[4:19:09] Zilberg: Blood should be a dps class imo
[4:19:23] DonCuzu: Do the mobs have to be in the Cons or do you just have to be in the Cons when casting the Exorcism? Can you check that?
[4:19:32] pigzip: You macro the 2 of them together
[4:20:07] RiptoreCA: KEKW
[4:20:18] sh1asurprise: @Towelliee A lot of the classes that get weaker just dont scale with stats, and its  a symptom of the massive expansion item level gaps we have now

[4:20:29] Dankind64: KEKW

[4:21:33] D1Chile: @Towelliee  how did prot paly feel ?
[4:21:36] rizuel23: wotlk wasnt a good xpac till ICC
[4:21:49] Aldurik: Does exorcism still have the same old sound :D ?

[4:22:22] RiptoreCA: For all the crappier players it was @rizuel23 Naxx was the first approachable raid for the pleb
[4:22:22] br3z: @Elson_Vi DF
[4:22:22] akuma_46: shits overlaping
[4:22:23] Raelynx27: I would expect Beta for DDF ahead of wrath launch if they really expect a 2022 release...

[4:23:36] ArcaneSyntax: I can't wait for fresh
[4:23:39] Elson_Vi: Anyone know what the addon is that flashes your ability icon in the center of the screen when it comes off cooldown?
[4:23:42] saevenar: not for the first dk you make
[4:23:45] Zilberg: Can do that easy in 6 weeks

[4:25:32] ravensky93: dream about it

[4:36:32] jackymoon: whats equal justice
[4:36:35] Dankind64: hahhaha
[4:37:37] RiptoreCA: He is trolling
[4:38:00] Bigvont: it would be OP if all paladins get the proc from Ret aura :D
[4:38:24] Karn1987: the doctors think a stint might fix it but  i don't know when i can get it
[4:38:33] RiptoreCA: 7k dps or bust
[4:38:58] berserker_strike: use conscration bro  BuddhaBar
[4:39:19] jackymoon: no orange juice ... cant conscrate
[4:39:19] berserker_strike: even its 1 target worth it to use it ?
[4:39:27] McLeod25: does the consecration from the art of war talent stack with your self cast consecration? Meaning, you get 2 consecrations?
[4:39:49] berserker_strike: Yes
[4:39:50] Woodland_Critter: Did Divine Storm use to have a different animation?
[4:39:52] Aldurik: haha like 10 attack abilities :D
[4:40:17] Golemites: It used to have a different animation pre-legion iirc
[4:40:36] grizzlyhorn: what ever happened to that consecration effect change back in like bfa
[4:40:57] berserker_strike: They intentionally gave rets so many bottons Kappa
[4:41:07] grizzlyhorn: it made the consecration look like light emitting from a lantern or something ill see if i can find it
[4:41:12] Golemites: It apparently tanked performance, so they only gave it to an NPC
[4:41:16] Woodland_Critter: @Golemites That's what I thought. The old one looked so much better, no?
[4:41:20] xUrb4n: that was for first boss dazaralor not for actual paladins
[4:41:51] SnakeDoctor09: SnakeDoctor09 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 43 months, currently on a 42 month streak! 
[4:42:06] RiptoreCA: I can feel the dracthyr healer panicing
[4:42:13] Golemites: @Woodland_Critter I actually dont know how the old one looked since I started playing again in prepatch legion since Wrath
[4:42:27] grizzlyhorn: @xUrb4n oh sadge - well here it is, it would have been awesome to see on paladins https://www.wowhead.com/news/new-paladin-consecration-spell-animation-patch-8-1-ptr-288483?page=3
[4:43:51] RiptoreCA: Dang this dungeon looks sick
[4:43:58] ashnmsr: what if it's not that early
[4:44:05] JzeaDecimate: This dungeon looks amazing. The art/design teams never fail
[4:44:10] Are_Jealous: They still got work to do on these talents *Cough* Mages
[4:44:22] Moobot: Plans for WOTLK LAUNCH! Marathon from Sept 26th - October 1st! This won't be like TBC Launch. Since this launches around DF Beta and DF Launch. We will still no life it and get Pre-Raid BiS. I AM PLAYING ON FRESH!
[4:44:25] liftedinxinfinity: ^
[4:44:26] RiptoreCA: Has a modern sunwell type vibe am I right?
[4:44:31] Darkterror141: it looks very polished for an alpha i think, or all alphas are like that?
[4:45:08] grizzlyhorn: warrior talent tree pls PepeWhy
[4:45:11] Cojoha: yeah we do
[4:45:12] dannyis1337: the talents are the only thing that worries me, thats going to be prepatch and PTR and it doesnt seem close to being ready
[4:45:13] Utmost777: it is a filler
[4:45:13] addictshinz: right
[4:45:17] RiptoreCA: Do you think they release all 4 remaining trees this week? Or 2 and then 2?
[4:45:18] Reille1027: yes they do
[4:45:18] MankiGames: Only on big AoE, if you have the spare GCD
[4:45:19] jkitchin75: yes we do
[4:45:19] tioniumwow: Exorcism back is pog
[4:45:20] Toad1231: as a filler we do
[4:45:20] LycanKain: You do as filler, yeah
[4:45:20] trixxnmore: ret has it , but not used in rotation
[4:45:20] Voyteh_: just a filler
[4:45:23] br3z: have it but dont really use it
[4:45:25] raye_gaming22: you do
[4:45:29] Golemites: When everything is down it's time to pee the ground
[4:45:29] KaisenSiru: Infrequently when there's nothing else to use
[4:45:33] Woodland_Critter: @Golemites So the swirly thing look very similar, but instead of weirdly just raising your weapon in the air, you make an actual attack.
[4:45:35] Fray24_: use it when there's literally nothing else lol
[4:45:46] juyyyhjyyh: I think that the alternate timeline maps that were found on wowhead will be for the "mage tower type system" that blizzard announced in the interviews. Going to different timelines with the bronze dragonflight and killing bosses actually seems pretty cool ngl-
[4:45:46] highlord_dabsalot: Has it now. Pointless tho
[4:45:59] Fray24_: nah
[4:46:01] silversquall88: more a filler spell when you have nothing to press
[4:46:07] Cosmolus: no
[4:46:07] Cojoha: conduit lets us heal a lil
[4:46:10] highlord_dabsalot: Heals for a tiny tiny amount while u stand in it
[4:46:11] br3z: it has no class interaction at all, was just heres a useless button
[4:46:22] br3z: spec interaction rather
[4:46:25] cliche_cat: no but it does big dmg on its own
[4:46:37] addictshinz: Would be cool if there was no GCD on it
[4:46:42] highlord_dabsalot: Used for pulling stealthies in arena

[4:52:52] Cosmolus: consecration damage is laughable.  idk why blizzard is trying to make a spec around a filler ability
[4:53:14] Ribastur0075: ye dmg on ret seems fine, its just mobility and raid spot issues
[4:53:18] br3z: @Cosmolus cause other abilities interact with it
[4:53:34] Bigvont: Ret was always pretty much like press whatever lights up

[4:59:30] lloydimus: cub*
[4:59:46] lalelusa: did DH come out for alpha today?!
[5:00:19] RiptoreCA: No, he just didn't want to struggle tank. So he switched to what he knows.
[5:00:30] watpuppy: @lalelusa looks at screen
[5:00:32] jwt55: Natalie Portman bro?!?
[5:00:56] Darwoo: pokemon cards the goat
[5:01:08] thebakeriscomingforu: Collectable Card games and Sports cards are so expensive these days.
[5:01:13] CardinalTX: Only thing I collect is EDC knives
[5:01:29] Holysal: i see all the breakers on tiktok its crazy how many ppl buy into those
[5:01:29] Lockpwn: Lockpwn subscribed with Prime. 
[5:02:01] danoh_64: i spent 30 bucks for 300 cards and made my mney back with 5 cards
[5:02:29] playdarkholes3: That isn't necessarily a bad thing though
[5:02:34] the_name_is_x: get them wow cards

[5:02:55] RiptoreCA: SO basically at this point, the only thing broken is Talent trees? The game otherwise is solid?
[5:03:22] jwt55: The timing and nuance to the ads makes them almost worth watching
[5:03:50] danoh_64: never get into a break so disappointing
[5:04:16] HaxzorJimDuggan: im seeing a lot of vegas flooded tik toks this morning
[5:04:20] RiptoreCA: The tank was slightly out of range and the evoker didn't move forward
[5:04:23] RiptoreCA: that 25yd range
[5:04:24] Holysal: breakers buy all the boxes then sells packages. you get all the cards in that package. thats good or bad.
[5:04:47] danoh_64: yes
[5:04:52] Holysal: depends on the breakers
[5:05:04] danoh_64: but you cant choose your team
[5:05:26] danoh_64: its random
[5:05:31] mmrghost7: do u think a 2 month of beta can do it ?
[5:05:32] jwt55: Jesus tap dancing Christ the army ad getting me
[5:05:37] TrixStar36: If you wanna see how breaks work just watch Layton Sports cards YouTube channel. He’s one of the best.
[5:06:24] Therman75: agreed
[5:06:26] jwt55: Can’t tell if I’m too high or not high enough
[5:07:26] danoh_64: dont work that way
[5:07:27] manmower: you should find a way to combine breaking with fantasy baseball
[5:07:30] JWoody82: there are a lot of pick your team breaks
[5:07:40] Coriollis: from trash behaviour so far looks like u get to use shield of veng more often
[5:08:33] TrixStar36: Teams are priced based on the value of cards/players. For example if you joined a football break you’d pay the most money for the chargers because of Herbert cards.
[5:08:54] sLogOG: stunlocking boss PogChamp
[5:09:06] Charocalypse: maybe intentional on normal, but not in myrhic
[5:09:12] Annahkin: Is evoker fun to play? or is it too easy to be fun
[5:09:14] danoh_64: dont get caught up in the hype. collect your favorite players
[5:09:16] Coriollis: paladin op confirmed can stun bosses
[5:09:35] Holysal: ive seen alot of breakers do divisions instead of teams
[5:10:04] BigJustin26: have they fixed avengers shield yet?
[5:10:05] mackoida: You put it down and pray the tank moves the boss through :D
[5:10:36] R0yalFluffy: Hey Towelliee, do you know what the dungeons in season 1 will be?
[5:10:45] instant_savage: why play evnegce with no talents
[5:10:56] mrmanno14: dps meters or logs? or not in alpha
[5:11:04] TrixStar36: I know a lot about breaks I started in 2011 lol
[5:11:07] Holysal: @instant_savage prob a one trick
[5:11:08] Coriollis: on a more serious note they had mini bosses in the past that u could cc and when u hit m+ they were immune to cc
[5:11:35] horsingtonhorse: have you tried the new ret aura
[5:11:47] RiptoreCA: That tank is @HAMMERRAZOR in chat in case you didn't know LUL
[5:11:52] cptrogers123: Tauren ret pala looks the coolest imo

[5:17:46] Tonipepperoni07: Tonipepperoni07 subscribed at Tier 1. 
[5:17:56] Vile_: No HP from AS is completely fine, people just think the sky is falling.
[5:18:15] Vile_: The shit they packed into talents for it are gonna make up for it in a large way.
[5:18:15] kokochris: @jwt55 I would say closer to a warlock.  Magic tricks, raising the dead, totally against societal norms of the times...
[5:18:40] Sollice: I hope they give DH armor that doesnt look like they are wearing a fucking trash bag
[5:18:43] majestictaco0: How does exorcism feel?
[5:18:58] jwt55: Definitely had an alt warlock.

[5:19:22] thebakeriscomingforu: avenger's shield not having silence is weird. hope blizz fixes that
[5:19:54] BigJustin26: lol 2 evokers and a demon hunter flying by and @towelliee is like I have wings as a pally, why can't I fly too!?
[5:19:54] thebakeriscomingforu: ah ok, that makes sense
[5:19:56] RiptoreCA: @Sollice @HAMMERRAZOR I agree. I am loving DH right now. But the gear.
[5:20:09] JStevenson: so basically were gonna have to spend another point to get a silence off AS?
[5:20:21] Sollice: @RiptoreCA Its so bad I wont play the class because of it
[5:20:23] doomlolz: lol everyone is playing an evoker
[5:20:45] Sollice: I dont know if they have released any other color variants but

[5:21:10] Wolfenhoof: @doomlolz yes in the prepatch to level 60, then i go back to my beloved herd^^
[5:21:18] thebakeriscomingforu: I'll probably play my guardian and Dk in DF
[5:21:46] RiptoreCA: @Sollice The new tier gear looks amazing I think
[5:21:46] rymerre: do DH have their talents?
[5:21:51] Thoreya: no
[5:22:10] rymerre: so he has no kit
[5:22:17] TheItalianStallion321: thats a true player right there no alpha talents still playing the class
[5:22:29] Sollice: @RiptoreCA I dont like it. Everything is so bulky. That being said I have not looked to see the armor on a BE or NE yet. Can you do that on WoW head dressing room?
[5:22:30] rymerre: damn thats hardcore
[5:22:32] skreng: they have whats on retail available to them, not the new trees
[5:22:38] Revoca: Maybe he is trying to get and idea of the class before they gut it
[5:22:54] RiptoreCA: @Sollice checking now
[5:24:02] ijuki: Is that flickering reported? Or was it just me?
[5:24:11] HAMMERRAZOR: @RiptoreCA yea the gear need a little rework but even softos teir set the triangle helmet looked stupid
[5:24:18] RiptoreCA: @Sollice doesnt look it
[5:24:25] Sollice: bleh
[5:24:26] Rottencoarse: @Towelliee  https://twitter.com/WealthyMan/status/1552809369258971136 appereantly C9 has dropped their WoW esports teams
[5:24:29] puddypounce: once you go demon hunter other classes just aren't the same
[5:24:33] Sollice: Maybe it looks better on the right races
[5:24:36] json_dotcom: @Rottencoarse RIP
[5:24:40] raye_gaming22: DH palyers are hardcore they will either play DH or Monk nothing else
[5:24:52] Verdigo__: taikoe subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 9 months, currently on a 3 month streak! 
[5:24:53] majestictaco0: @Towelliee are you running/have you tried the new consecration stuff?
[5:25:10] HAMMERRAZOR: @Sollice they preview the dh gear on humans so it looks weird
[5:25:25] Vonsterr: just go blue evoker and blayst mein
[5:25:54] Speshulist: D:
[5:26:02] Coriollis: one evoker was blue and the other red right ?
[5:26:05] thekexman: What was the healing like?
[5:26:16] thekexman: Interested to see what the Evoker could do?
[5:26:58] manmower: are you doing all that boss dmg because you're in the singletarget spec?
[5:27:01] RiptoreCA: @Sollice actually yeah, DH looks one of the worst of the batch
[5:27:15] Coriollis: the holy generator power is just too good :D
[5:27:27] Fray24_: yeh
[5:27:28] Harshblue: yes
[5:27:28] Sollice: I wonder why they dont have it on the model viewer yet
[5:27:31] Cosmolus: yes
[5:27:35] lukaskar: yeah thats the way it works
[5:27:43] all_beef_franks: that's all they got!
[5:27:51] Ribastur0075: final verdict talent might good in single target raid environments
[5:28:02] HAMMERRAZOR: i understand dh is supposed to be all tattered and what not but it would be cool to give us something a little different
[5:28:18] Mecabeast: final reckonning does a  chunk but needs giga haste
[5:28:20] QMGSaint: Think consecration will get a buff soon. So many consecration nodes on the tree
[5:28:39] Holysal: @Rottencoarse yeah sucks but understand why since WoW esports isnt great
[5:28:53] kingliar: right talent tree is also cool for single target
[5:29:00] Cosmolus: yap . consecration talents are dead talents
[5:29:06] Revoca: they want ppl to play it but don't buff the skill enough for it to be good
[5:29:24] RiptoreCA: @Sollice @HAMMERRAZOR I don't have horns. But with the new tier set I will have to add them. It looks dumb without them LUL
[5:29:34] rymerre: the dot ones or consecration were never going to be good
[5:29:44] Utmost777: does it look cool at least?
[5:30:02] McLeod25: how's the holy power generation from consecration if you've tested it?

[5:30:08] sesram: cons has to be buffed big time if they want us to play it. otherwise you might as well just go single target build and use DS to cleave
[5:30:16] Vonsterr: what are you trying to look for?
[5:30:21] kingliar: isnt the talent that buffs eake of ashes maybe better?
[5:30:28] kingliar: wake*
[5:30:30] HAMMERRAZOR: @RiptoreCA the horns are fine but like i was saying maybe changing it up a little
[5:30:40] Sollice: @RiptoreCA Got to have the horns man. You are a DH!
[5:30:44] manmower: just ramps up consecrate
[5:30:47] Golemites: Should be a debuff then
[5:30:52] Shadowmograine: Its a debuff  on enemys
[5:31:08] Trexxter: enemy debuff

[5:31:55] RiptoreCA: The concept art for the DH set looked significantly better than actual
[5:32:02] Sollice: Yeah it does
[5:32:08] rymerre: @RiptoreCA thats true for all of them thou

[5:32:21] Sollice: Again..Much more streamlines and bad ass. I get it, but all of the first tier armor is very bulky and rocky
[5:34:07] Sollice: I also hated Fel Reaper too though
[5:34:12] Golemites: Honestly I would have loved to see Vanquishers Hammer back in some form, it's only bad in SL because of what it competes with.
[5:34:21] pigzip: @towelliee are the stats for prot and ret the same or do u need different stats ?
[5:35:06] tebbix: this zone reminds me of Gorgrond
[5:35:06] JellonaCub: Is the flying much worse with this iteration?
[5:35:26] LearnedSomething: not an issue with normal flying
[5:35:44] propwash80: @towelliee just joined the stream but how does ret feels?
[5:36:10] JellonaCub: Hope they fix it and dont continue with that path then
[5:36:32] lalelusa: could it be because of the talent points from the coins? perhaps the effects aren't balanced yet

[5:37:06] manmower: maybe you get a talent to make it maneuver faster
[5:37:14] Sollice: @manmower No
[5:37:22] i_wish_southbadboy: is it similar to how vehicles turn?
[5:37:23] Fawcheddar: they'll probably revert it
[5:37:26] ZuggSpeedman: they made it so you can't make super tight turns

[5:40:39] HAMMERRAZOR: yea
[5:40:41] SyRr82: this game is noob friendly now
[5:40:42] all_beef_franks: coming out of SL leveling though you are only 120ish ilvl... so you have to be able to do it around there
[5:40:43] tebbix: yeah you can get 254 spamming bgs right now
[5:40:45] charlie_the_snowman: How does the ads mechanic work on twitch. Is only Twitch able to pop on ads at any time? Or can a streamer pop them on too at any time and get a cent or two from them?
[5:41:18] lalelusa: it looks cool though
[5:41:20] manmower: talent to let our dragon pick herbs and mine ore

[5:44:39] HAMMERRAZOR: i cant wait to use dreadfire vessel again

[5:47:10] sainstrife: Lol the change to boosting has got plp all up in arms on Classic TBC servers.
[5:47:15] zenFX_: IF deathwing can carry the raid on his back then galakrond could carry the whole raid instance on his back
[5:47:28] manmower: we'll probably have an entire raid that takes place inside Galakrond's corpse
[5:47:28] OviTheGray: might a former consort of Alexstrasza
[5:47:29] Exoduc: OwO why not
[5:47:38] BlueBlurPrime: galakrond body still in Northrend

[5:48:05] Tambandia: Nah, it's the questline where you accidently resurrect galakrond
[5:48:13] Sollice: Thats how its going to happen
[5:48:13] NicktheGatorfin: What class do you think the new talent system has the biggest impact on so far?
[5:48:25] IronDanTV: Cool kids spec*
[5:48:26] OviTheGray: @kimmo_gaming there are rumors that someone took them from Dragonblight
[5:48:56] Exoduc: @Sollice i think so except its not chromie who does it, its murozond who pulls us back to that moment
[5:48:57] tebbix: @Sollice That would be sick

[5:49:36] Sollice: @Exoduc You think we will see him go to murozond this expansion?
[5:49:37] Cojoha: is that a generic leveling trinket or dungeon trinket?
[5:49:58] OviTheGray: @zenFX_ idk.. maybe
[5:50:15] Exoduc: @Sollice Absolutely, we already defeated his future self but have yet to see him turn, he's totally going to be a end boss this xp
[5:50:37] HAMMERRAZOR: how do you get the envokers to SL?
[5:51:08] HAMMERRAZOR: its not there for me :( i want to try flying in rivendreth
[5:51:12] Sollice: @Exoduc Would make sense. I love the look of the Infinite Dragonflight
[5:51:26] OviTheGray: @Sollice we have more chances of fighting Murozond again then we have to even see Galakrond
[5:51:35] toadette1337: why do they have the blizzard action bars limited to 5? if the point is to have it replace addons then they should increase it to 10 optional action bars, right?
[5:52:00] Utmost777: what if the only way to get there after prepatch is to die and use the spirit healer lol
[5:52:06] finejeez1: ever play GW2? reminds me of griffon flying
[5:52:21] Exoduc: @Sollice he's probably going to escape us easily and drop us in some raid with galakrond and give us the finger while blip'ing to another timeline

[5:53:03] mavericks312: sindy maybe?
