[0:43:22] liljimsterr: that doesnt matter as much with retail now that horde and alliance can do almost everything together
[0:43:22] Jtbrig1: Megaserver.
[0:43:24] SaulGoodman_: One server to rule them all
[0:43:27] keterych: The giga server
[0:43:27] Big_Headed_Gamer: danGachi mega
[0:43:29] Manyfist: This is why I hope SoD will only have like one or two servers in total
[0:43:31] elscarface1: Yeah
[0:43:32] Saber2904: GIGACHAD server
[0:43:33] Jtbrig1: Would be nice is regions wasn't a thing as well @DansGaming
[0:43:33] Mja00: Megaservers and datacenters like FF14 danNodders
[0:43:35] CHUPAWUNGA: moon2GIGA GIGA server
[0:43:36] MarriedToMyCorgi: They need to go F2P so that more people play
[0:43:38] FleetAdmiralPsycho: @elimud the popular pvp server's have a bunch of WPVP
[0:43:38] jackalo34: @sierrasol this too true
[0:43:40] Zimmy99: They made them connected which is an improvement
[0:43:41] Porkbutt1984: danClueless wont cause lag
[0:43:43] PieceOfMind_: Blizzard doing a good idea??
[0:43:43] Estegard: Yeah, I learned the bad way that lesson when I joined a pvp with a Draenei in a 70% Horde server LUL
[0:43:45] ChieveMoe: there would be some mad Stormwind raids going down
[0:43:49] OMGdoughnut: OMGdoughnut subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 19 months! 
[0:43:49] RainRioken: One for Pve, PVP and RP probably
[0:43:52] TheColdAge: I agree, it's also good for maintenance down times
[0:43:54] RoarinShots: thats still not going to do much, ppl will still pick whichever has more
[0:43:54] Ghades84: barriers are already pretty down in retail
[0:43:57] Mord_Vi: ahh, i see, a central server hub that auto-routes you
[0:44:01] keterych: Quel'Thalas is ~50 - 50
[0:44:03] CHUPAWUNGA: Clusters
[0:44:06] elchiiko: Is it hard to reach 60 in HC?
[0:44:09] Big_Headed_Gamer: now, to do that they would need to upgrade the servers and they aren't about that. danGnome
[0:44:10] CanadianUncleSam: Mega Servers?
[0:44:10] liljimsterr: ya a lot of servers are clustered now
[0:44:17] meh_ninja_please: elchiiko very supposedly
[0:44:27] PieceOfMind_: @elchiiko yes, it takes a very very long time
[0:44:29] TolgaDraws: People were against that for Classic WoW
[0:44:33] CrowCawl: @elchiiko it's called Hardcore because it's easy
[0:44:33] Corvin_Tom: but with classic there is content difference
[0:44:47] Smackgag: it calls server meshing
[0:44:47] 1arkantos1: if servers already suffer on expansion releases, a megaserver would be just chaos, they would have to do a lot of deep changes for that
[0:44:50] Manyfist: danMad #NOCHANGES danSgame
[0:44:51] brianite: That’s what guild wars 2 does
[0:44:52] RagingPunk: are servers up?
[0:44:53] Herethos: like in swtor i had a bunch of characters on different servers, but now they're all merged
[0:44:58] FleetAdmiralPsycho: Nostalrius megaserver with like 10K to 15K ppl online was sooo funny
[0:44:59] Estegard: @keterych I switched to Quel later because the servers in my region were Horde-dominated. Worth the higher ping
[0:45:00] TheColdAge: The problem is that Blizzard also makes money of people when they want to switch servers

[0:47:36] WeeMr_Goodcat: servers and faction are almost pointless on retail now, guilds are cross server/cross faction, everything except timewalking i believe is cross

[0:49:36] jackalo34: @roarinshots  yes most will but theres some ppl who like bein on the less pop side plus with only 1 server it's easier for hoizz to incentivize balancing sides so pull swap n once they do theres no other server to try so things may balance out. I get ur right but theres potential.  Or just drop factions

[0:54:19] Kaizokuboy: Is there an Addon list?
[0:54:20] jackalo34: @roarinshots wat I mean is they could force keeping balance by limiting cgsr creation within a range depending on each factions percentage.  This couldve also been done with multiple servers tho it runs potential friend grps. Imo factions in general are the problem instead of choosing pvp sides once in game in a way that doesn't keep friends from playing together initially
[0:54:21] MagnaCarter_: thems the rules, you must learn whatever the first recipe is that drops

[1:17:41] GhostChili: lul
[1:17:41] macmittens808: retail is more difficult and less chill, more of a deep dive, two completely different games at this point

[1:17:44] KZ_Official: BaldCanadianFather Oh.. Lol, thanks. LUL
[1:17:45] doctor_mav: WoW from Cata onwards became increasingly more action oriented and less RPG. Also more lobby-based, it's crazy you can reach max lvl without ever leaving the capital

[2:53:02] Herethos: I suffer from altitis so I make a new character before reaching end game
[2:53:03] nolraizer24: danLurk
[2:53:03] pctr2142: Vanilla/BC yea not wrath
[2:53:03] weekendgeek: danHi

[2:53:11] joaosjunior: addons
[2:53:11] winsseli: 50 eur for level boost ty blizzard
[2:53:13] Kennaay: Leveling is my favorite part, does that make me a bad person
[2:53:13] Faelboat: man getting to 60 was such an achievement
[2:53:14] CplDanjou: Spent more in end game

[2:53:15] vegemiteappreciator: End game daily grind loop
[2:53:18] AulanaBM: i prefer end game stuff
[2:53:18] ODDtheFool: I was a PvP'er so I always had content LUL never really rerolled much
[2:53:19] IceCool666: Well, there is no leveling in retail danKEK You blink and you're max level
[2:53:19] rickastley1111: mind blown danThink
[2:53:21] mondtier22: KEKW
[2:53:24] evericed: dan, lookin good with the scruff
[2:53:26] Zimmy99: i got almost all classes to max at some point danHmm
[2:53:26] CanadianUncleSam: Def not, 1 or 2 characters max and then just end game.
[2:53:28] Flecked: retail is dogshit
[2:53:29] gslaves: I found leveling to be too lonely, nobody would level with me danSad
[2:53:31] titosamson07: War, druid, priest
[2:53:36] leises: o/ Leveling was the game.
[2:53:37] remoburton: The bummer is that now the leveling is so fast I feel like I'm missing out on stories on the way up
[2:53:41] AlwaysOphinerated: I was an absolute alt-aholic.
[2:53:41] McCrory: I only lvl3 chars, I did did everything in endgame though on 2 chars
[2:53:51] mondtier22: vanilla endgame is great, especially if u like casual randome pvp
[2:53:54] vegemiteappreciator: danUgh Level every class to max
[2:53:55] Alepouditsa: ohh mount drop is on!
[2:53:57] krayaal: not the wabbit!
[2:53:57] storbabs: BibleThump BibleThump
[2:53:59] GamerPenny: D:
[2:54:00] DARKENIGMA: LFG made me level alts less during wrath but I mainly leveled before then
[2:54:01] JewelPengin: I personally liked the leveling aspect of OG. It felt more like teamwork. Then you _finally_ do a cool dungeon every so often
[2:54:04] KodaiRyu: yeah retail WoW is just World of Chorecraft
[2:54:06] Zimmy99: there are some catchup mechanics later on in a dlc that makes leveling a bit easier as well now
[2:54:06] mondtier22: instead of only arena like wrath
[2:54:07] metalwrath22222: oh thats me
[2:54:09] fxzues: its super therapeutic lol
[2:54:12] Trazix52: i only play warrior
[2:54:14] drakduck7: Poor little wabbit
[2:54:16] vegemiteappreciator: I had one hunter that I played exclusively for most of TBC/Wrath/Cata
[2:54:18] Trazix52: something wrong with me
[2:54:20] metalwrath22222: i make 999 characters and never get to max level
[2:54:20] DarylVanHorne: sir why the rabbit ? danMad
[2:54:29] Bohb: Leveling was fun back then LUL Still happy for my server first DK to 80 achievement back from WoTLK
[2:54:32] Herethos: is there level locked content in the game? like if you reach level 10 this item never drops or you can't enter this dungeon any more?
[2:54:39] KodaiRyu: yeah dungeon finder is stupid
[2:54:41] Zaraji: LFG RFK
[2:54:43] NBK_Sethus: dungeon finder, lfr, connected/cross realm stuff
[2:54:43] Mescheen: Socializing danSus
[2:54:53] GenericFutureMan: Which is weird b/c finding dungeons before that was such a chore
[2:54:55] Dastorn: Boooooooooo
[2:54:55] shadows_embrace_you: I think Raid finder is what ultimately did that Dan. Not dungeon finder
[2:54:56] Gale_ryn: 5 hours in town to find a group peepoHappy
[2:54:56] metalwrath22222: dungeon finder is good if you only have 1-2 hours FeelsBadMan
[2:54:57] big80s: Garrisons also killed socializing in WOD
[2:55:00] Pixelmain: Dan! We do not socialize...
[2:55:03] GenericFutureMan: Unless you were a tank or healer
[2:55:07] Mescheen: Teaching people skills? danNopers
[2:55:07] Cakedonut: It could be like FFXIV where your dungeon companions are AI KEKW
[2:55:07] Sehria_K: my antisocial butt loved dungeon finder... didn't have to talk to anyone
[2:55:08] mondtier22: they also killed server identity completely when they made the whole server pool que for rdf and bgs and not only server
[2:55:11] corvferr: Zoomer features
[2:55:13] Alepouditsa: by that time ppl were leaving so it was normal the put that on
[2:55:19] TheGaoSora: nope, it's called the evolution of the internet :) people don't need the chat box to talk with friends
[2:55:19] ODDtheFool: Yea that was always the best bit, adding people after dungeons and growing a friend list full of cool people Pog
[2:55:20] Jenrage: Dungeon finder loses the community aspect of WoW, imo
[2:55:23] funksdelic: the game became toxic when they put a rating number on dungeons
[2:55:26] vegemiteappreciator: I thought you hated socializing with randoms Dan? :D
[2:55:27] HealingRains: They say words to me but not nice ones
[2:55:30] mondtier22: just because they dont know how to fix unbalanced servers faction wise
[2:55:32] mb9023_: good I hate talking to people
[2:55:40] unanimous: I type "GG" at the end of a retail dungeon and the entire group is disbanded before I hit send
[2:55:41] GenericFutureMan: I liked dungeon finder but think it should be limited to servers
[2:55:41] Gale_ryn: i think gear score was worse than dungeon finder
[2:55:50] NightJams: cross server pvp was a bummer, you used to know and fear/hate people in there
[2:55:51] titosamson07: I had a 19 an 29 twink rogue and shammy
[2:55:52] ZoOlja: everyone wants to do everything superfast and not talk or anything
[2:55:55] Pixelmain: If you are tank or healer
[2:55:56] Brainmanager: @funksdelic already when gearscore came in wotlk it was bad
[2:56:01] mondtier22: if dungeon finder is server only its fine
[2:56:01] DarylVanHorne: @DansGaming Still makes me laugh that Leeeroy Jankiiings clip when people doing important dungeon run danKEK
[2:56:02] vegemiteappreciator: Gear score was kind of toxic
[2:56:11] Zaraji: too real
[2:56:12] ODDtheFool: LUL so true
[2:56:12] Kennaay: Gear score is when guilds became elitist
[2:56:12] 8bitbarbarian: it's mainly because in dungeon finder you're grouped with people you're never going to see again so why bother talking?
[2:56:14] IceCool666: danAware
[2:56:15] macmittens808: in retail, the more chit chat in a dungeon group the worse it usually is, i've seen people leave when someone starts a convo
[2:56:17] mondtier22: whats the point playing with randome people from different servers u never see again
[2:56:17] CanadianUncleSam: Gotta get your Stave level up! :D
[2:56:21] Whatnos: gearscore and achievements
[2:56:23] daniminh: Sadge true
[2:56:24] Gale_ryn: yep Sadge
[2:56:24] Kurbol: Needing to actually walk to a dungeon was fun
[2:56:25] DARKENIGMA: GS killed guilds with member culling over it LUL
[2:56:27] funksdelic: IO score *GAG*
[2:56:28] Giubz: Gamer #8475, please get in line
[2:56:32] Bezzay: danSgame
[2:56:35] Crowskape: I am 349 MrDestructoid
[2:56:35] TheGaoSora: gear score, meta, parses yeesh...
[2:56:41] pctr2142: Mythics definitely brought back more social grouping
[2:56:42] lealel: and then finally raider io score...
[2:56:45] HealingRains: Lemme check your logs man
[2:56:45] xSinisterStrike: sounds like destiny lfg people get really snobby
[2:56:46] mojoj0j0o: oh this isnt a hunter - did that one bite the dust?
[2:56:48] Mescheen: Just wear off-pieces to inflate your gear score danEasy
[2:56:54] RaptureRiot: @DansGaming the social aspect is what made mmos great in the past
[2:56:55] psy989: Ahhh good Ole priest  leveling
[2:56:58] Jenrage: Parses, tho danCringe
[2:57:01] Pixelmain: @mojoj0j0o Servers down for maintenance
[2:57:06] HealingRains: HealingRains subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 55 months! 
[2:57:06] TheGaoSora: esporting mmos is the dumbest thing
[2:57:10] metalwrath22222: ^
[2:57:13] mojoj0j0o: aaah ok thnx
[2:57:16] Compound65: Compound65 subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 2 months! Woohoo
[2:57:20] snuffles_80: that was why dungeon finder was so great.. gear score ruined rthe way people recruited for dungeons
[2:57:20] funksdelic: you PM them to join the raid and you have to wait 5 minutes while they check raider IO and check every fight you've done for the last 4 years
[2:57:22] metalwrath22222: imagine esporting against mobs lmao
[2:57:23] Herethos: or someone going in undergeared so you need to chain heal the guy and he dies anyway and complains about heals
[2:57:28] CanadianUncleSam: Ya, Gear Score and linking achievements to get into a dungeon/raid is dumb as heck.
[2:57:29] Crowskape: BabyRage my dps teammate isn't BiS
[2:57:31] Drainora: chat is just jelly of my baconscore Sadge
[2:57:40] vegemiteappreciator: Mythic+ was fun but it kind of changed dungeon philosophy. Everyone speedruns every difficulty now
[2:57:41] BoodyTV: I mean classic wow players are the same for raids, if you dont have a certain dungeon set or item they wont take you.
[2:57:41] Molehj: @Drainora monkaS
[2:58:00] mondtier22: never liked pve in wow, only hc made it kinda fun
[2:58:01] Crowskape: danDrool @Drainora
[2:58:18] funksdelic: if you don't have fire resist, you aren't getting in a certain streamers raid for a certain raid dungeon
[2:58:28] Nelciel: hey dan and chat danHug danTifa what was our death? danSad
[2:58:32] Bohb: Most toxic thing ever is conjure water and conjure food. As soon as u rolled mage you were just a huge Buffet to people
[2:58:51] BoodyTV: @bohb as you should be (:
[2:58:53] Brainmanager: @Bohb that is why mage table is there 8-)
[2:58:57] javidesign95: hell @DansGaming are you getting stronger ?
[2:59:03] macmittens808: its the top end of any game really, retail has plenty of friendly nice folks too
[2:59:08] ODDtheFool: I quit WoW early Cata, came back briefly in Legion and now finally coming back for Season of Discovery Pog Clap
[2:59:18] winsseli: dungeon finder feels so bad, people stop talking, quit group in the middle of dungeon and being generally more rude
[2:59:20] funksdelic: gear score is not irrelevant it's just not the sole aspect of the player
[2:59:20] Herethos: wow, is wow 95gigs?
[2:59:25] metalwrath22222: retail is
[2:59:25] Mescheen: So many ribless boars
[2:59:37] Raznuts: rib for your pleasure?
[2:59:42] vegemiteappreciator: @Herethos Nearly 20 years of content danAware
[2:59:43] Dradclaw: Nessie
[2:59:44] zoopy_uk: oh cool, this is a new char, you must have made it to 60 already right?
[2:59:46] Brainmanager: @funksdelic the gearscore itself is irrelevant 8-)
[2:59:48] ZoOlja: killed an entire species for ribs danAware
[2:59:57] funksdelic: Dan going balls out cuz it's not hardcore
[2:59:58] titosamson07: Dan's in the forest killin boars again. Love it
[2:59:59] metalwrath22222: small gb means worse game right? Kappa
[3:00:02] Herethos: which one is f2p until level 20?
[3:00:05] Herethos: retail?
[3:00:12] CanadianUncleSam: Boars don't have ribs, you should know this.
[3:00:20] seatea07: @Herethos yes
[3:00:30] corvferr: i remember when Blizzard said they would never do classic servers atpCap
[3:00:34] funksdelic: Southpark levelled to 60 apparently just killing boars
[3:00:38] metalwrath22222: all people of the horde are equal in my eyeeeees adventurer
[3:00:49] ODDtheFool: @corvferr You think you do, but you don't! Keepo

[3:01:07] Zaraji: NOOO
[3:01:07] DARKENIGMA: last I played retail was bfa and ilvl killed it for me with doing mythics as that was essentially gearscore. gear doesn't equate to skill and knowledge LUL

[4:44:50] Zimmy99: the end game in shadowland was horrible, very grindy. I quit as soon as i hit max lvl
[4:44:53] poondanky: wow was unplayable before shadowlands Kappa
[4:44:56] LRonHoover: @ash138_ danHat
[4:45:00] Bohb: Jailer best villain in wow history
[4:45:00] Manyfist: Legion was best retail expansion.
[4:45:00] titosamson07: Smite him
[4:45:01] untermann: shadowlands was one of the best expansions in the first months but then got bad
[4:45:04] etoile330: @shaneshane Agree! MoP was a lot of fun.. and pretty
[4:45:06] preeeemo: horde > alliance :tf:
[4:45:07] SkittlesRandom: I came back for legion after wrath then left right after again
[4:45:10] LRonHoover: danSip
[4:45:20] wessirius: @Zimmy99 you can say same about every expansions. or it was THAT bad?
[4:45:23] shaneshane: Wrath, MoP and legion were best addons to me. rest are all mid or awful like BFA/SL/Dragonshite
[4:45:25] ZapRnD: @Bohb all according to plan
[4:45:30] Kennaay: People didnt realize how good MoP was until like 3 or 4 years later danKEK
[4:45:31] Giubz: Looking forward to Shadowlands classic
[4:45:35] poondanky: horde cities are so much better
[4:45:39] Mord_Vi: i guess the big question is, if you come back to classic, and don't play or have these expansions, are you severly limitng your character?
[4:45:41] Natlum: Dan not buffing himself NotLikeThis
[4:45:42] shaneshane: @Kennaay this is kinda true, WoD gave people appreication for it lol
[4:45:46] GIRTH_TV: Are you gonna play the new season?
[4:45:48] SerpentsOfTheLight: @poondanky COPIUM
[4:45:55] Misterbaits: @Mord_Vi it affects retail not classic
[4:46:04] LRonHoover: Pepega
[4:46:07] ODDtheFool: monkaW FLY YOU FOOL
[4:46:09] big80s: BFA was terrible. Except the main ciry was and still is amazing
[4:46:12] Manyfist: WoD would be good if they finished the expansion
[4:46:13] Mord_Vi: what do you mean @Misterbaits
[4:46:16] shaneshane: MoP was just kinda meh at the very start with its dailies, and the end with SoO raid lasting too long, but otherwise it was brilliant tbh. Great raids, great pvp, timeless isle etc..
[4:46:26] ODDtheFool: Pog Dan the Undying EZ Clap
[4:46:38] Misterbaits: @Mord_Vi not having the lastest expansion limits the retail version (current) not the legacy/classic version(s)
[4:46:52] fourthanmore: retail is up now is hc classic up?
[4:46:53] poondanky: will they add BC to hardcore someday? lol
[4:46:59] Zimmy99: Timeless isle was fun
[4:47:01] Herethos: In Mod Organizer 2 is it possible to scan if there is an update for a mod?
[4:47:04] syncret_: the pvp island in Mists was great, had rare spawns too for mount farming
[4:47:04] shaneshane: I dont understand how MoP got so much hate for the panda and pokemon(pet) stuff, yet everyone wont shut up about dragonriding which is more daft then any of them
[4:47:05] Misterbaits: i like the MoP theme, characters, environment, music
[4:47:07] ZapRnD: @shaneshane yeah, i would love to replay MoP again
[4:47:11] Kennaay: @shaneshane Yeap danKEK maybe one day we'll get real player housing that isnt just a single expansion gimmick...
[4:47:32] Natlum: mind soothe is so OP
[4:47:38] eggcheezpotato: Garrisons danKEK2
[4:47:39] Kennaay: gArRiSoNs
[4:47:40] shaneshane: Wildstar had the best MMO housing ever, RIP :(
[4:47:49] LRonHoover: danCorpa how could they resist that?
[4:47:54] BruceAllrighty: SWG was the pinnacle of housing
[4:48:00] Mister_Loxley: f76 def made a pretty penny from that NODDERS
[4:48:01] Mord_Vi: wow i just had flashback of my house in Anarchy online
[4:48:06] WabbitHatter: i loved the player garrisons :)
[4:48:08] Herethos: entire players towns in SWG
[4:48:21] shaneshane: LOTRO had good housing, but in 2007 its kinda the same now so not great for its age
[4:48:26] ODDtheFool: I think I'm the only person that couldn't care less about player housing in MMO's KEKW
[4:48:27] Celebrim1: SWG had that horrible ring of houses around towns though
[4:48:42] EriSeidr: FF14 probably has the best player housing element
[4:48:47] Misterbaits: i want a good modern sandbox MMO
[4:48:49] Mord_Vi: easily
[4:48:50] soggycheeri0: what was the addon to see future spells?
[4:48:55] WabbitHatter: @ODDtheFool i feel like nowadays you gotta have player housing in every rpg basically :P
[4:48:56] shaneshane: @Misterbaits new world :P
[4:48:58] Brainmanager: shroud of the avatar also have housing
[4:48:59] Grayfox3d: ultima online, the only way you were getting a house is to buy one off ebay from someone lol
[4:48:59] Kennaay: @WabbitHatter It was neat until they just abandoned the system entirely once WoD was over, why not keep it going from expac to expac and have trophies you can display from each one / certain achievements... so much wasted potential
[4:48:59] preeeemo: @soggycheeri0 what's training?
[4:49:00] Wucco: Anyone else check the chat in their own game every single time the sound for "X has come online" plays on stream? LUL
[4:49:01] MrBr1ghtsid3: Oh did the hunter kick the bucket? towIgnit
[4:49:03] Mord_Vi: FF14 housing is the best easily
[4:49:07] TutturuTV: ff14 player housing feels like an endgame goal LuL
[4:49:13] preeeemo: @preeeemo is what it's called
[4:49:14] dengir214: @Mord_Vi if you can afford it.
[4:49:20] Mord_Vi: yea
[4:49:21] soggycheeri0: @preeeemo thank you!
[4:49:25] preeeemo: np
[4:49:27] EriSeidr: Yes
[4:49:28] Herethos: I'm surprised theres no housing in WOW, too many players I guess
[4:49:28] ZapRnD: @TutturuTV Just like IRL LUL
[4:49:32] Misterbaits: can't get into the FF14 art style and class design etc
[4:49:33] WabbitHatter: @Kennaay oh they stopped upping it? i stopped playing at some point so i dont know what happened later on :)
[4:49:35] Kennaay: Yes, you have to wait for a plot to go up for sale
[4:49:35] SkittlesRandom: FF14 buying a house feels like the real life house markey XD
[4:49:36] shaneshane: FF14 housing is awful lol, yous guys are wild
[4:49:36] ODDtheFool: @WabbitHatter I just find it so pointless LUL why would I wanna sit around in a house when I have a world of dragons to slay Pog
[4:49:37] Cfcampbell24: omg
[4:49:47] RainRioken: yeaaaah no ff14 housing is far from best
[4:49:48] Starlight_Veil: they are multiple wards
[4:49:49] Dolrick: yup but there are lots of appartments but they are smaller
[4:49:50] preeeemo: no it's pretty easy to get a small house
[4:49:53] epSeaLion: there are a LOT of houses
[4:49:54] Mja00: Yeah housing uses a lottery system
[4:49:55] Starlight_Veil: one player per house
[4:50:06] Ardes_: It's true. Limited amounts. If you don't log in for 30 days it can be put back on the market too
[4:50:08] NightJams: nobody mentioning ESO housing? it was....fine.
[4:50:08] preeeemo: large houses however are almost impossible to get
[4:50:11] Valearleen: there is always empty lots
[4:50:11] WabbitHatter: @ODDtheFool so you would have displays of trophies and unique weapons and a place to rest and restock etc. :)
[4:50:11] Natlum: buff your party members?
[4:50:13] Starlight_Veil: houses are small, medium, and large
[4:50:13] Mord_Vi: Sounds like real life
[4:50:14] Wrenton: Chat... Housing is basically a lottery now.
[4:50:15] MabusGaming: BUT everyone can get an apartment
[4:50:16] Mord_Vi: KEKW
[4:50:19] shadykins3: danBlanket
[4:50:20] shaneshane: @NightJams ESO housing is pay2win though really
[4:50:21] Mybash_: Too much data?
[4:50:22] pixel_bnuuy: I love my house in FFXIV. I spent so much money decorating it
[4:50:22] tinyangrygnome: they want it to be open world i guess
[4:50:25] TutturuTV: danHmm
[4:50:26] preeeemo: they do have instances
[4:50:27] Cfcampbell24: like blizz server cost
[4:50:27] NeonFlux: Arche age was crazy for housing you had to claim the ground with a garden
[4:50:33] HannHannBann: yes but if the player does not enter the house for 45 days they lose it so it opens up for more players. You can also have instanced rooms with the apartments but definitely not as nice as having a house
[4:50:40] Mja00: There are kinda instances for housing.
[4:50:45] Wrenton: THEY DO. Its called Apartments
[4:50:46] wwishie: Black desert online has the best housing.  My waifu is so comfy
[4:50:47] MabusGaming: Every person can get an apartment in their Guild Home, or in cities.. but the house plots of land are limited and lottery system @DansGaming
[4:50:47] ElSpartin: there are 60 versions of each house on each server since there are 30 wards and each ward has 2 versions of the house
[4:50:47] Woody1978666: Hi Dan, any tips as I'm going to start wow for the first time, but I'm not sure if I should start in hardcore or normal
[4:50:50] preeeemo: they just added a bunch more housing in ff14 so anyone who wants a house has one now
[4:50:52] ODDtheFool: @WabbitHatter Fair enough, I know a lot of people want it so I do hope they get it at some point. I think I'll remain homeless though KEKW
[4:50:53] JoblessGarrett: im here for the leveling!!
[4:50:53] Misterbaits: blizzard has their own servers right they don't host on like amazon
[4:50:58] JoblessGarrett: How far are we on classic
[4:51:07] ODDtheFool: @JoblessGarrett GARRETT Pog
[4:51:13] Cronos_100: if its instance there's no social
[4:51:14] SarudaBaruda: i lost my house and all my stuff because i let my sub stop for a while
[4:51:15] ODDtheFool: Chong Gong
[4:51:16] Valearleen: because its distric like a hub
[4:51:17] preeeemo: I literally just bought a 2nd house for a solo FC
[4:51:17] marekm991: Because real estate space is limited
[4:51:20] EriSeidr: Idk why they decided to do it that way. Maybe because of server load?
[4:51:23] Dolrick: they do have an instanced one, but they're appartments so way smaller and you dont lose it if you dont log for a while
[4:51:25] talisaurus: I remember in UO everyone would gather around a house that was about to be condemned and loot all the goodies
[4:51:26] JoblessGarrett: Did we make it to 30 on Hardcore?
[4:51:29] WabbitHatter: @ODDtheFool yeah its totally dependent on a player´s preference. i prefer to have a "home" in an rpg. :)
[4:51:30] Gogo04: only game that does that is in lord of the rings and Everquest 2. ff14 is weird iwth their housing
[4:51:37] epSeaLion: theres 5 different housing districts, and each district has 30 wards of like 60 houses each. some are reserved for individuals, some are reserved for free companies (guilds/clans)
[4:51:37] preeeemo: I was the only one in my lottery
[4:51:41] Brainmanager: @Misterbaits except for diablo on playstation/xbox
[4:51:41] LRonHoover: danUgh oom
[4:51:45] NeonFlux: When they opened expansion area in arche age the land claim was over in about 5-10 seconds lol entire map
[4:51:46] shaneshane: if you ever have a question about FF14 that is 'I wonder why they done it that way?' the answer is usually consoles :P
[4:51:52] marekm991: Archeage also has housing districts that are not instanced
[4:51:53] Leisure_Suit_Larry: I'm having Taiwanese wine sausage from the airfryer
[4:51:57] TutturuTV: have to remember ff14 is pretty old too
[4:52:00] epSeaLion: and thats per server, so theres plenty of houses out there
[4:52:06] Misterbaits: @Leisure_Suit_Larry pog
[4:52:10] Herethos: Is Dan doing a Dangeon?
[4:52:18] ODDtheFool: @Herethos Keepo
[4:52:19] pixel_bnuuy: Yes.
[4:52:27] shaneshane: air fryers are best invention in last 400 years
[4:52:28] Ardes_: @DansGaming Do you miss the thrilling fear of permanent death while you play Wrath? LUL
[4:52:31] Misterbaits: @Herethos ragefire chasm
[4:52:36] Gogo04: everquest 2 is older than ff14 and their housing system is hard to compete with
[4:52:40] Ellie_Stark_: @shaneshane danWeird
[4:52:40] Moobot: danYes Follow Dan on his Youtube Channels: Stream Vods: http://www.youtube.com/DansGaming?sub_confirmation=1 Shorts Channel: https://www.youtube.com/@dansgamingshorts?sub_confirmation=1
[4:52:44] Corvin_Tom: DPS dan per second
[4:52:54] GoldIncome: that warrior probably sweating a bit
[4:53:05] NeonFlux: The most funny thing in arche age was the crime system reporting murders and people on trial and vote for them go jail
[4:53:08] preeeemo: anyone who complains about final fantasy 14 houses never played finfal fantasy 11
[4:53:13] Misterbaits: wait a min, this is retail? lol
[4:53:17] LRonHoover: danGameFace

[4:53:58] preeeemo: I still think that star wars galaxies had the best housing
[4:54:09] Nelciel: peepoHappy
[4:54:10] SD_PuppetPal_Clem: Blizz probably keeping HC CLassic down on ppurpose hping people will care more about the new Raid in retail
[4:54:26] RainRioken: SWG did have it down the best, tbh, making your own villages in the wild on Tattooine atc
[4:54:38] NeonFlux: If someone was killed in pvp it left a bloodstains and you could use that to report the crime
[4:54:40] vegemiteappreciator: danNice
[4:54:45] ODDtheFool: NICE NODDERS
[4:54:55] marekm991: @NeonFlux Jury duty was fun, but most funny thing in archeage was that you could not speak the opposing faction language and their chat was jibberish
[4:54:57] Juicefullorange: danFine
[4:55:02] fourseasons321: Did you reached lvl 30? I'm 60 in Diablo 4 already

[7:17:56] doctor_mav: I reached 45 with Rogue in HC and quit because I got bored. Doing dungeons is the most fun aspect of the game for me, but getting a dungeon group at that lvl as a Rogue is near impossible. Spent 1 week trying to find an Ulda group, failed, and got bored of just questing.

[7:18:35] metalwrath22222: doctor_mav i am planning to switch to normal servers becauase of this, I never played classic and I want to experience dungeons
[7:18:36] graycatbirds: @doctor_mav no one wants rogues and hunters in dungeons in hardcore sadly
[7:18:42] Sehria_K: why did that become a meme? just because it has a stupidly long name?
[7:18:48] w0rksOnMyMachine: [Thunderfury, Blessed Blade of the Windseeker]

[7:18:57] NoMoreSadness: did i miss the dungeon

[7:19:02] metalwrath22222: [Thunderfury, Blessed Blade of the Windseeker]
[7:19:02] graycatbirds: @metalwrath22222 if you play priest or warrior you'll have more dungeon invites than you know what to do with
[7:19:04] Kennaay: @Xkorpitron ohhh thoise are cool, I have two Heavenly Onyx cloud serpents right now, but my favorite pet is Loque'nahak from Sholozar
[7:19:04] chazisop: frost mage is probably also really good for hc, you got frost armor, really good cc
[7:19:11] ODDtheFool: @w0rksOnMyMachine Orange for me Pog
[7:19:12] Citruss_PUNCH: 1 of 2 in classic if im correct
[7:19:18] Hippy80: @Sehria_K Because it was a legendary drop, and people started linking it to boast they had it, then it got meme'd
[7:19:21] w0rksOnMyMachine: @ODDtheFool oh it changed in time LUL
[7:19:21] Xkorpitron: @kennaay i have it but hardly use it
[7:19:23] metalwrath22222: graycatbirds I play warlock but I'm scared of getting other people killed, because I never did the dungeons before
[7:19:27] Nazzmul: @Citruss_PUNCH 3 iirc
[7:19:32] fruitvendorx: You stop using voidwalker around 30
[7:19:34] fruitvendorx: It's bad
[7:19:34] sithius75: safest class is warrior Kappa
[7:19:35] Citruss_PUNCH: 3 right
[7:19:38] Nazzmul: naxx has a legendary aswell
[7:19:41] Nazzmul: the mage staff
[7:19:41] chazisop: @graycatbirds I mained a warrior for most of wow, I wouldn't want to level a warrior hc
[7:19:44] Oarens: Kennaay that's my favorite hunter pet, it toom me many hours to find it. danHug
[7:19:45] CanadianUncleSam: There are 4 leggos in Classic iirc.
[7:19:46] Eraste: i play mage when classic first came out. did one BG at 60 and quit because i got sick of being a vending machine danKEK2
[7:19:47] tinyangrygnome: @ashathx not in hc you dont lol
[7:19:48] Zippy1990: What are the most dangerouse classes
[7:19:57] Citruss_PUNCH: @Nazzmul forgot the staff
[7:19:57] doctor_mav: @doctor_mav Yup, plus Rogues take some Warrior loot, don't bring buffs, and, well, there's a lot of them. They have amazing utility in the right hands, but most people don't seem to care or realize.
[7:19:58] Alanaze: Mages need to eat after each mob killed tho danKEK2
[7:19:59] Thorggrim83: Warrior is safe danTifa
[7:20:02] CanadianUncleSam: Thunderfury, Hand of Rag, Atiesh and 1 more.
[7:20:02] tinyangrygnome: people use voidwalker all the way to 60 in hc
[7:20:02] graycatbirds: @metalwrath22222 it's really hard to kill a group as warlock, you should be fine. just careful with pet
[7:20:04] fruitvendorx: @tinyangrygnome Yes you do. Drain tank with succ is faster kill rate and just as safe
[7:20:08] Nazzmul: @Citruss_PUNCH NODDERS
[7:20:12] jackalo34: warlock has 0 escapes n fear is risky cc so can be scarier than u think
[7:20:15] Xkorpitron: @eraste i like some cupcakea please and mana buns
[7:20:17] wufferen: Druids are very weak in the beginning
[7:20:21] Raltis: Rogue is fun though!
[7:20:22] metalwrath22222: graycatbirds yeah in dungeons its on passive and I command it to attack
[7:20:22] wwishie: Druid before 20 is tough
[7:20:25] wtfblub: shaman due to accidental totem pulliing
[7:20:27] chazisop: shadow priest probably
[7:20:29] Eraste: @Xkorpitron oh sorry, i happen to be afk atm danKappa
[7:20:31] jackalo34: but yes not dumb lovk can r rly easy
[7:20:31] BoodyTV: @DansGaming they added debuff timers and cast bars to classic Pog
[7:20:37] Xkorpitron: Kappa
[7:20:38] doctor_mav: @metalwrath22222 If you play a class that can tank or heal you shouldn't have much problem finding dungeon groups
[7:20:45] Janaasaas: thats why soda is playing a warrior i guess?
[7:20:45] Optimisprimerib: warrior is really rough
[7:20:46] Kineticbomb: Rogue has vanish so it can be safe.
[7:20:53] sithius75: as a priest be ready to use your wand A LOT
[7:20:53] Kineticbomb: Stealth aswell
[7:20:58] Eraste: the big problem with hunter are the people playing them danKEK2
[7:21:02] ChieveMoe: Marks was the best spec, slapped right
[7:21:06] Wrenton: Sulfras, and Thunderfury werevtge only Legdaries in Vanilla... also Naxx Had Atesh and The Ashbringer.. but nobody got the latter and was removed come Wrath.
[7:21:09] chazisop: @Optimisprimerib i guess level as prot/fury? that would be such a pain
[7:21:09] Dolrick: @sithius75 i'm playing priest and i'm debatingg getting improved wand talent LUL
[7:21:10] tinyangrygnome: rogue very safe. vanish, sprint, evasion. so many tools
[7:21:14] Raltis: @Kineticbomb You'd be surprised how finicky Vanish can be.
[7:21:15] Wrenton: Were the *
[7:21:15] Oarens: Eraste D:
[7:21:15] Xkorpitron: I love beast mastery hunter
[7:21:17] ODDtheFool: Hopefully Warriors get Victory Rush early in Season of Discovery, will help their levelling alot
[7:21:18] Ozcro: rogues and hunters are amongst the strongest after 30
[7:21:27] Zellidon: With a big 2h Hunter can melee too, big Wing Clips
[7:21:28] ChieveMoe: oh end game of course, yea bm the way to go leveling
[7:21:30] Nazzmul: BM is pretty comfy ye
[7:21:36] Kalderasch: More power to Owlbert
[7:21:43] Xkorpitron: Survival has an odd rotation imo
[7:21:44] CanadianUncleSam: BM easy leveling spec.
[7:21:44] BoodyTV: @Ozcro warriors too, once warriors hit 30 they just scale so well

[7:22:04] kvol_: @DansGaming you can't move while shooting as hunter in vanilla correct?
[7:22:07] Xkorpitron: I never played mm hunter
[7:22:12] chazisop: if only classic was on the previous patches were bubble+hs was uninterruptible because of duration KEKW

[7:22:18] DarkBlueManta: spider meat? danGross
[7:22:27] OuroborosChemist: @kvol_ you can stutter step
[7:22:28] doctor_mav: Rogues have great survivability, but needs to be played proactively. It's also very cooldown reliant.
[7:22:37] konejeesus: you should definitely get Weapon Swing Timer @DansGaming
[7:22:38] Oarens: DarkBlueManta it's ok with hot sauce peepoFAT

[7:23:40] Bohb: @Janaasaas oh shit, forgot about that one
[7:23:42] OuroborosChemist: autoshot always takes same time recardless of weapon speed so slower weapon means more movement in between
