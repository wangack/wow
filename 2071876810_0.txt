[0:46:49] Voodoh_: lets be honest in p1 even meele hunters got more useful buttons to press to do dmg
[0:46:57] bangbangdeveloper: @SONII Arms is teh top dps right now. A bit disingenious to say it doesn't play differently right now?

[0:51:42] Voodoh_: that would be sick
[0:51:49] bangbangdeveloper: I wonder how classic bladestorm would look like tho
[0:51:56] deltrexx: they had some ideas like that datamined heroic leap gladiator stance but i guess they scrapped it

[1:44:47] Wellequipped: spam SSF and then after a week do like 50/50 sod/ssf
[1:45:00] Ervill1: im kinda gonna miss the runes tho, gonna be weird for a sec
[1:45:07] camzchill: have you seen the new anime solo leveling feel like youd like it
[1:45:10] soapbargoeshard: tea or coffee?
[1:45:15] Wooshu: leveling a Priest feels like a chore after SoD leveling
[1:45:26] Vellusk: LOL
[1:45:28] soapbargoeshard: no just which are you in general
[1:45:29] drengark: Turn Up the Music MR Sonyy
[1:45:31] MarkyOchoa: soo..... tea or coffee
[1:45:32] inspect4: @Wellequipped why would u rather play on old server where there is bunch of maxed 60s alrdy with ruined economy and players who arent playing sf
[1:45:33] yaboyKobra: u got aminooo acids I have tequilaaaaaaa
[1:45:47] Vellusk: "tea or coffee?" "uhh bench days are mondays and wednesdays"

[1:46:27] moosetrakks: non essential technically
[1:46:31] bigsugg: u dont drink beer??
[1:46:33] zen_oni_shinobi: i used to sing a lot.  chamomile tea was a godsend for my vocal chords.
[1:46:35] Selecktt: Here mate. I made a weakaura to display when Slam is safe to use with precise timing. Only displays when MS and WW on CD and you have the spare rage.  https://wago.io/PRueH9OlW
[1:46:38] Roo1993: 10 mans killed my guild
[1:46:47] Pixiepantss: i just wish they werent so long
[1:46:50] zen_oni_shinobi: can 100% suggest to anyone who talks alot during wrok.
[1:46:51] Roo1993: no one wants to do 10 mans on 3 day lockouts
[1:46:52] zen_oni_shinobi: work
[1:46:58] limburgse: wasnt this the same as old vanilla launch?
[1:47:06] Tyfonius: yeeah me too, makes it more manageable to keep up
[1:47:08] MarkyOchoa: People are going too sweaty for these "level up" phases. Making them bigger than what they really are.
[1:47:10] limburgse: or was it 1-60 on release?
[1:47:24] Wellequipped: will blizz ssf even let you group with people?
[1:47:31] artilectXLII: yeah, with these phases it is interesting how scenery changes where the action is happening; STV is BIS
[1:47:41] Roo1993: they needed to make it 20 mans on 7 day lockout PLUS a 10 man on 3 day lockout imo
[1:47:43] tsetse2fly: @limburgse to 60 at launch
[1:47:44] Wellequipped: if they stick true to community SSF rules new or old server doesnt matter

[1:49:06] Selecktt: I really love the level bands. Lets me freely level alts without worrying about falling behind the curve on my main.
[1:49:27] handy_grenade: what do druids do with their weapons when they shape shift
[1:49:36] Shieldermak: !song

[1:49:42] kelvimortis: ya i messed up and got BCAAs
[1:49:52] a_blkd: contraversal take dude gonna lose onlyfans subs
[1:50:07] zen_oni_shinobi: content development has come a long way.  we used to sit for four to six hours in world arena to get content that would take 10 mins today.
[1:50:14] nowheretoday: Lol
[1:50:17] Ervill1: What I personally don't like is people expecting 6/6 exp. Phase is still new and not everyone leveled fast. I can't find a raid and I low key gave up already
[1:50:46] Pixiepantss: 100% KEKW
[1:50:54] Selecktt: Bro people are STILL checking logs for BFD alt runs

[1:51:02] ogMansoN: i need to make my own raid for later night raids 10est pref
[1:51:06] inspect4: @Wellequipped yes any day lol
[1:51:09] Pixiepantss: no way?!
[1:51:10] Seline88: problem is everyone has a parsing brain these days
[1:51:11] Pixiepantss: hahahah
[1:51:21] Screamnsteam: i check logs for RFC
[1:51:25] NericoTV: but am i a asshole for not wanting to carry people laying dead on 4/6 fights every weeks?
[1:51:31] handy_grenade: "lfm gnomer 6/6 xp 99 pare checking logs, mothers maiden name, social security"
[1:51:39] fictionless33: wanna duel bro?
[1:51:45] fictionless33: nice hair
[1:51:48] fictionless33: sick
[1:51:49] pantsgrab__c9: I am still struggling with the last level and a half all my sm groups I have tried are going to shit, having to go into quests i could grind for next phase hurts and just killing things is boring asf
[1:51:50] Hollywood78: 3 day lockouts are srs bzns
[1:51:58] Wellequipped: i have a 5 man core and build gnomer groups, i just ask people looked up a gnomer short guide

[1:53:21] inflictawarlock: doesnt hurt to teach some people
[1:53:27] NericoTV: if people two weeks in a row cant manage to get more than 1 green parse do i rly need to inv them to my raid?
[1:53:53] Selecktt: I tried to lead a pug where my only requirement was knowing fights. Could not get past grubbis. This place is super easy. I dont like the stupid high requirements to get into a pug, but I understand why they are there.
[1:53:53] inflictawarlock: a rotation tho
[1:54:07] brownfiesta: Cant teach an old dog new tricks

[1:54:30] chetwalterz: @brownfiesta you totally can. everybody playing classic is an old dog and they all learning new tricks
[1:54:36] wisescience: make them take a typing test first and if they’re above 80 WPM then they are teachable
[1:54:40] zen_oni_shinobi: i agree.  back in season 2 of original tbc you didn't need a percent of games played to get a title, as long as you were on the team at the end of the season, you were awarded.
[1:54:47] NericoTV: first week a my guild invited a mage doing 400 dps less then our other mage... week one that is rough af

[1:57:03] Ervill1: @NericoTV genuine question: so how can i convince raid leaders to invite me at this point? i have prebis but that doesnt mean anything, they wasnt 6/6 exp and good logs
[1:57:03] fillway: house ain't the greatest either tho
[1:57:17] Gillbawk: 1000000%

[1:57:40] zen_oni_shinobi: @Ervill1 don't take it personal.  they're looking to fill a slot someone had previously held. find a guild that fits you
[1:57:40] TheTrueShayde: dating apps suck, i wish more human interaction was a thing without being a creep

[1:58:54] troobii: its the one downfall of int fasting, so hard to get the food in after fast
[1:59:00] Selecktt: I got two dozen chickens. Lot of my protein comes from lots, and lots of eggs.
[1:59:02] SpacebarBarbarian: i find it hard to get enough protein without like 1lb chicken per day
[1:59:05] troobii: feels like force feeding
[1:59:11] kelvimortis: what daily protein you eating?
[1:59:14] ogMansoN: dude my man boobs turned to man cones it was terrible

[2:04:17] KairuruTV: i dont even care if they are good or not lol
[2:04:20] B1oobear: tank warlock is really cool right now and i think really good on def ive seen one clear 3 people before but luckily 3 classes they could actually manage
[2:04:23] Selecktt: Here's a numerical change; warriors gain +50 all res, +1000 armor, and +1000hp. there we go.
[2:04:26] dft_kekwplays: warrior need shockwave 100% .... the need a stund or stormbolt
[2:04:33] MzterE: the 30% dmg bonus from having same weapon type is going away
[2:04:36] fezioh: Alliance wsg Tabard is BiS
[2:04:38] Shepp22: did you watch the new Avatar last airbender?
[2:04:40] B1oobear: because im a balance druid rn and i delete those warlocks but they are very strong
[2:04:41] MzterE: RIGHT after I got both fist weapons this week
[2:05:17] KairuruTV: LOL you arent beating ANYTHING at the duel tourny
[2:05:21] B1oobear: yeah those warlocks are good bro theyre really cool
[2:05:25] limburgse: DinoDance DinoDance DinoDance
[2:05:26] Selecktt: BS helm and res potion lol. 100 all resist right there. And prayers. lots of prayers.
[2:05:30] Wooshu: Mage or SPriest will win the tourney
[2:05:35] tsetse2fly: @SONII Did you see gnomer bosses got armor nerf? That gonna help warrior pve
[2:05:39] CwoodAGG21: do you think there is any class right now warrior could beat 1v1
[2:05:46] KairuruTV: warriors hsould get like a 10% health handicap in tourny
[2:06:07] Azzidoza: Azzidoza subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 6 months! I am a man of my word.
[2:06:15] MzterE: 1507 crit?!
[2:06:18] Selecktt: @CwoodAGG21 I think warriors do good against ferals right now
[2:06:28] KairuruTV: mages?
[2:06:32] dft_kekwplays: warrior need 1 stund .
[2:06:35] soapbargoeshard: have you run an stv since they removed some of the layers? ITS BAD NOW
[2:06:38] outofmanax: nah mage literally nova, deadzone charge, living flame watch you die
[2:06:49] Wooshu: I was watching Xaryu duel today, a well played Mage I dont think anyone is really beating
[2:06:52] bouginio: yo mike sick hair brah!
[2:06:52] Nightbot: yo
[2:06:52] Selecktt: @outofmanax Warbringer lmao
[2:06:54] ballsofruenkiller: stv is packed
[2:06:56] MattOriginal: STV is pure lag
[2:06:57] soapbargoeshard: SUPER LAGGY. YES
[2:07:00] limburgse: stv is bugparty
[2:07:05] outofmanax: @Selecktt warbringer in deadzone? teach me how plz
[2:07:09] limburgse: lagparty*
[2:07:12] KairuruTV: when you hit trinket they hit their 1 shot after and u fall over lol
[2:07:35] Azzidoza: have you seen how to not train as a healer (new anime) shits dope and (solo leveling) both epic
[2:07:35] Ervill1: show us
[2:07:38] Wooshu: Not with their self heals anymore
[2:07:40] SurrealAndre: you'll get kited out and die from living flame if he's frost
[2:07:43] Selecktt: @outofmanax Same way you've been able to intercept mages for the last 18 years. Nothing about warrior playstyle has changed.
[2:07:46] Wooshu: Maybe classic Mages, not SoD mages
[2:07:50] Ervill1: Pog
[2:07:51] tsetse2fly: @SONII If you faced like Xaryu or Ziqo in 100 games, how many would you win?
[2:07:59] outofmanax: @Selecktt Youre in a nova in deadzone. You literally cant charge out of it
[2:08:00] pengwin06: you talkin frost mage or other specs of mage?
[2:08:06] Greatpickle: RIP the locks are gone!
[2:08:10] jschroe3: warbringer ruined mages
[2:08:12] jschroe3: mages are dog
[2:08:15] ogMansoN: then all priest has to do and all 3 dots and disperse
[2:08:19] KairuruTV: then they cold snap nova
[2:08:23] Selecktt: @outofmanax Bro mages have had nova for 18 years and warriors have been able to deal with it for 18 years. nothing has changed in that regard.
[2:08:46] KairuruTV: a lot will depend on crits i think o warrior though
[2:08:52] pengwin06: duel a mage rn
[2:08:54] Wooshu: I would love to see Xaryu lose a duel, it just doesnt happen on his Mage
[2:08:56] KairuruTV: if you can at least get 1 crit to put pressure it gets easier for sure
[2:08:59] Passiontech: @jschroe3 KEKW
[2:09:01] Wavy_Sinatra: u got 9 min u good
[2:09:02] tsetse2fly: @SONII How many of the games vs Xaryu or Ziqo do you win out of 100 atm?
[2:09:13] artilectXLII: xaryu was talking something about living flame & wasting time in ice-block
[2:09:29] dft_kekwplays: how about vs warlock?
[2:09:37] ballsofruenkiller: i actually like us vs shaman, rogue, and ranged hunter rn... if u find a warlock not running metamorphsis its competitive
[2:09:42] outofmanax: @Selecktt Im beating most mages. But as soon as a mage just plays fire, spamm dmg and deadzone nova they dont have to kite you. You just die before they do.
[2:10:27] Passiontech: Thats a big pussy
[2:10:35] ballsofruenkiller: spriest is disgusting
[2:10:37] ogMansoN: big brain
[2:10:46] mavrayeth: homonculi die in 2 hits hto
[2:10:47] Passiontech: 5Head KEKW
[2:10:47] dft_kekwplays: is that mount 100% speed no right ? it looks so fast
[2:10:56] B1oobear: you could always use a polymorph like skele or prirate ninja for that mount
[2:11:00] miciahclay: No its 60 still
[2:11:01] CwoodAGG21: think youll ever play as tauren?
[2:11:17] Selecktt: @SONII Yeah man. You can get up to 140 shadow res self buffed for 10 seconds.
[2:11:18] NoNeedtoScopE: how is warlock on this phase?
[2:11:30] tsetse2fly: YEah
[2:11:34] TofuBenedict: THIS
[2:11:35] brownfiesta: yes
[2:11:35] CwoodAGG21: yeah tauren would be sick dude
[2:11:35] itstenaciouswow: yes
[2:11:38] kingsquatch21: did you tank gnomer earlier?
[2:11:40] MzterE: I love Cow Goes Bonk
[2:11:40] Seline88: Want to see the real you! no mog
[2:11:41] CwoodAGG21: but with your own gear
[2:11:42] B1oobear: yeah thats cute / cool
[2:11:43] bouginio: try female orc youll like it i think
[2:11:44] artilectXLII: ye, go natural for a bit
[2:11:45] soapbargoeshard: which farm did you grow up on
[2:11:47] B1oobear: moo
[2:11:48] WintersWolfcry: Jesus christ the nostalgia hit from the Pat video just slapped me in the face there. Thank you haha
[2:11:58] Gillbawk: moo moo motherfucker
[2:12:06] Colamitus: Playing tauren brings the pat out of all of us
[2:12:11] itstenaciouswow: Tauren hunter chad tapping in
[2:12:13] EzraSteel: Breaking Me Down -SOIL
[2:12:15] ogMansoN: do you have the edge of insanity code?
[2:12:16] B1oobear: i always loved tauren
[2:12:18] Civix_1802: is imorph a addon now?
[2:12:39] vash61: zinroq
[2:12:42] KairuruTV: feel like axe looks better on tauren for bulk
[2:12:47] Colamitus: dreadnaut with mom
[2:12:51] hannahbizzle: how is he loooking like that in warlord gear lvl 40?
[2:13:03] B1oobear: i had tauren warrior tauren shaman tauren hunter and tauren druid when i first started before blood elves

[2:15:37] Quaylin: SONII !!!!!!
[2:15:41] zen_oni_shinobi: yellowcard
[2:15:42] Icelol123: yes
[2:15:46] Barefootdan: What was the song name of the name that played before deadmou5
[2:15:46] zen_oni_shinobi: blast from the past
[2:15:57] Colamitus: i didnt save my toon so i just had to make 2 new warriors on era and clear all 40 mans weekly to get the gear back
[2:16:10] MaybeCallMe: MaybeCallMe subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 38 months! 
[2:16:11] soapbargoeshard: they removed 4 layers
[2:16:16] Quaylin: Popped in my head today. Diggin the new hair bro
[2:16:22] jschroe3: what a banger
[2:16:29] austinb678: austinb678 subscribed with Prime. 
[2:16:37] WintersWolfcry: It was pretty wild lag today
[2:16:40] WintersWolfcry: in STV
[2:16:52] Digga17: They ruined STV @Sonii. Goodluck bruh
[2:16:52] soapbargoeshard: layering problems are bad rn with grping
[2:16:54] austinb678: able to show me pvp talents and the runes you use?
[2:16:57] galleq: soni why u never do morning streams with coffee or tea and just talk about whatever. no gaming just talking for a bit
[2:17:05] tsetse2fly: @SONII Did 2 earlier today and it was unplayable, not coming back if no change
[2:17:10] ogMansoN: i cant wait to come back sunday and have my rank 5 title
[2:17:17] Tyfonius: they fixed it but it ruined layering everywhere else in the world so it seems they reverted it
[2:17:19] ballsofruenkiller: sonii.. whats the gold guide for warrior rn.. struggling bad.. ive just been sticking with skinning n selling..
[2:17:22] soapbargoeshard: BC HE GOES OUT IN THE SUNSHINE
[2:17:24] myso3188: what mount is that?!
[2:17:33] tsetse2fly: @SONII They decided to do less layers to make world more vibrant
[2:17:34] GregWasTaken: smoke sesh with sonii
[2:17:35] Selecktt: Too busy riding a bike naked.
[2:17:38] limburgse: i would watch :)

[2:19:41] Speyto: Good thing I'm done with the mount grind if it's like this
[2:19:47] spyrayias: they need a few more years xdd
[2:19:54] TheDyslexicGamer: bad game Kappa
[2:19:57] broughtpain: Blizz always has to hav something wrong
[2:20:01] Tyfonius: jesus
[2:20:15] tsetse2fly: LESS Layers
[2:20:19] soapbargoeshard: removed 4 layers
[2:20:20] MattOriginal: Lag was so bad earlier Xaryu was saying he might just quit doing the event all together.
[2:20:23] naynayayx: payo complained better event laggy and an alive world then game dead with no lag event
[2:20:32] Civix_1802: its not even playable
[2:21:11] carl99: I havent really started phase 2 yet is lvl 40 more fun then 25?
[2:21:15] logic__: seems like the layer thing is worse than it was
[2:21:41] maijoz: What did I just read?
[2:21:46] notgridles: wtf anime soni back
[2:21:47] KairuruTV: if they would just change their layering to affect zones specifically like sharding for the event only it would help
[2:21:55] bouginio: i mean ye, but they had like what 30years to fix it
[2:22:03] brownfiesta: hwo far are you off mount?
[2:22:10] KairuruTV: id even be willing for them to treat it like a pseudo-instance
[2:22:17] Gillbawk: they are building on the old engine
[2:22:25] Gillbawk: spaghetti code
[2:22:26] maijoz: Oh I understand what he meant now haha
[2:22:29] spyrayias: is it? They're still working with the game from 15 years ago
[2:22:34] betterchetter: what did you do to your hair?!
[2:22:49] KairuruTV: blizzard also has a habit of firing anyone who gets to a certain pay grade and seniority to save money
[2:22:56] TheDyslexicGamer: I like it
[2:23:00] MzterE: I mean, they could never have expected that code from 2004 would still be attempting to work with all these changes 20 years latewr
[2:23:02] GregWasTaken: how'd he get that sword
[2:23:18] maijoz: It's not like it's unsolvable, warmane the private server manages it. And there are definitely more players in an area at once than on a retail server
[2:23:25] MarkyOchoa: They need to start putting in those Microsoft devs on the programming
[2:23:29] tsetse2fly: @GregWasTaken it's called imorph, use at own risk
[2:23:29] MzterE: because there was 100 servers and server pop was tiny
[2:23:31] KairuruTV: because we arent on the vaniilla client, we are on the activision+ client
[2:23:35] TheDyslexicGamer: it porb cost more so they cut cost to save money or some shit
[2:23:37] Bear_OCE: i feel like it did we just didnt have the internet speeds to notice it
[2:23:45] KairuruTV: we had less lag on nostalrius
[2:23:48] MzterE: now we have 4 servers with 10000+ players
[2:23:58] betterchetter: Your hair looks good just caught me off guard.
[2:24:03] KairuruTV: but a LARGE part is the fact that the servers population is too big
[2:24:04] GregWasTaken: @tsetse2fly xdddd
[2:24:10] ogMansoN: pretty sure they didnt have the code from 2004, it was thrown away and they stated that before launch of classic
[2:24:19] sand_pump: i think blizz devs are on that gay sonni forum
[2:24:22] limburgse: :(
[2:24:24] brownfiesta: there are a lot more players playing on the servers
[2:24:27] GregWasTaken: billion dollar company too
[2:24:28] KairuruTV: playing warrior atm does that LOL
[2:24:52] spyrayias: they didnt make a billion by not cutting corners
[2:25:19] tsetse2fly: smart by Savix
[2:25:22] artilectXLII: this cat-mount seems okay on tauren
[2:25:30] dft_kekwplays: kinda sad for the people that have not played it yet at all... like me
[2:25:30] zen_oni_shinobi: okay i accidently switched to another stream and tabbed back into my game.  the streamer was blowing glass, i thought my headset blew a speaker.
[2:25:44] itstenaciouswow: has it always been laggy or just recently?
[2:25:46] Playonwordz: did gnomer twice epic staff dropped twice i lost it twice
[2:25:47] GregWasTaken: they're called programmers
[2:25:51] mavrayeth: being on wildgrowth im not having any issues tbh, maby server specific issues
[2:25:53] Gillbawk: I am betting that this is low on their priority vs retail
[2:25:59] Okizoo: server cost is what is outrageous
[2:26:04] sand_pump: shoulndt be that hard for the devs of the game lol
[2:26:04] brownfiesta: the vendor doesnt even have enough rewards for it to be worth playing the vent anyways
[2:26:04] TClear: wildgrowth is awful rn
[2:26:05] BrotherDanTV: I'm yet to have any lag issues on my realm
[2:26:06] Gillbawk: Retail is much more profitable
[2:26:07] GregWasTaken: i mean yeah
[2:26:07] Tyfonius: it's the way layering/sharding works
[2:26:10] MarkyOchoa: Hard to tell without knowing their codebase... but i'll tell you it'll be a long pipeline
[2:26:12] fillway: it's expensive, but i don't think it's that expensive nor not possible w/ a server upgrade or something
[2:26:20] tsetse2fly: @TClear how so?
[2:26:26] maijoz: What weapon are you using?
[2:26:28] maijoz: WW axe?
[2:26:31] MarkyOchoa: excuse me sir "software engineers"
[2:26:31] TClear: @tsetse2fly its lagging? lol
[2:26:33] fillway: coders, programmers, networking engineers, system admins, etc
[2:26:35] Gillbawk: its low on their priority therefore there's not enough staff working on this
[2:26:40] Screamnsteam: Ion said in an interview its not a money issue, they just arent sure how to fix it and if anyone has any ideas theyre all ears
[2:26:43] naynayayx: im no guru but i think 2 many multiplicators on skill pure vanilla with this even without runes wouldnt be laggy maybe
[2:26:54] KairuruTV: the issue from a coding issue is that the BASE code of the game would need to reworked, which is A LOT of work and then nothing would work exactly as it should to mimic vanilla wow  the issue is two fold: the code is a very inefficient for classic wow, and with them spinning multiple layers of that bad code with populations of 60k+, its all kinda dominos
[2:27:01] tsetse2fly: @TClear You mean it's just awful at STV event or in general?
[2:27:04] a_blkd: it can involve a complete overhaul of the backend of this game
[2:27:14] broughtpain: every question is answered with the question "what will make us the most money?"  and sometimes that means leaving stuff broken
[2:27:14] MarkyOchoa: PRIME TIME WOW BABY
[2:27:16] MzterE: there was a good twitter thread done by a dev 3 after a response to Aggrend about why "upgrade your servers" doesnt work
[2:27:18] TClear: @tsetse2fly STV thats literally whats being talked about in stream
[2:27:19] adeywyatt: Why don't you use the PvP mace?
[2:27:24] Pixiepantss: its awful
[2:27:30] the_audacity_x: youre getting the Aussie experience
[2:27:32] fillway: @KnetikTV ah alright that kinda mades sense if the code is trash
[2:27:45] ogMansoN: honestly you only need what 15 silver to get all you want then you never have to do it again
[2:27:51] Bear_OCE: yep
[2:27:55] Jaycee_lad: yeah its less than ideal
[2:28:04] KairuruTV: ya the only FIX for this that is reasonable is make more actual servers instead of layering
[2:28:09] phinn_insertclass: the baseline net code wasnt meant to have all these new abilities. dont think its something theyll ever be able to fix with this many players in close proximity.
[2:28:14] CwoodAGG21: warrior aka graveyard simulator?
[2:28:23] KairuruTV: because on chaos bolt we have ZERO lag at any time for stv event
[2:28:28] Gillbawk: just know there will be a day where everyone in the world will be able to play together with 0 lag
[2:28:29] KairuruTV: its just super chill
[2:28:29] zen_oni_shinobi: layers are essentially a copy of the original, if you change the base the layers will adhere.
[2:28:30] Vitticus: and when people leave company and you bring in new guys. usually college kids, they are tasked with trying interpret old code that someone else did
[2:28:40] a_blkd: they need high T programmers which are NOT cheap
[2:28:50] fillway: @KnetikTV is the code really that trash that if they bought bleeding edge hardware they'd still be having problems?
[2:29:03] sand_pump: ashenvale wasnt this laggy
[2:29:04] sand_pump: but no pvp
[2:29:15] ogMansoN: i swear in cata or wod they came out with server wide pvp events
[2:29:21] Vitticus: even if the code is was average, the technology wouldn't able to handle the demand
[2:29:26] Shelltonius: to layer or not, that is the question
[2:29:35] KairuruTV: @fillway sadly yes, the hardware can be the top of the line, but if the code is bottlenecking the packets received and sent, it wont matter at all
[2:29:36] ogMansoN: i dont think so
[2:29:36] creaturesfan72: just shard only STV
[2:29:38] BobLongMVP: this is same lag as first few hrs of SoD
[2:29:41] creaturesfan72: 4Head
[2:29:44] GregWasTaken: ur a photoshop layer
[2:29:49] brownfiesta: Ashran was instanced
[2:29:51] hannahbizzle: !song
[2:29:54] kcufthis: one of the devs wrote a thesis about how it’s a cpu limitation causing the lag
[2:30:14] MarkyOchoa: their servs
[2:30:22] RamosaTV: SONII I just finished reading solo leveling... MY GOD IT WAS PHENOMENAL
[2:30:25] creaturesfan72: they arent using 20 year old code LUL
[2:30:28] KairuruTV: the coding is bad so it bottlenecks the cpu because it is sending and receiving packets inefficiently
[2:30:35] SpacebarBarbarian: the layering is for the whole world though, way more than 300 per layer
[2:30:39] KairuruTV: so its kind of a cpu issue, but thats not the cause of the issue
[2:30:47] ogMansoN: yeah ashran was fun
[2:30:53] fillway: i don't see why it'd be beyond current hardware's capacity to spin up additional servers per layer and just keep parties together on layers
[2:31:03] zen_oni_shinobi: i was a gm and admin for ultima online. take a meeting stone for example. you'd have a command as a gm to open a menu on the summoning stone.  once the menu is open you can make it clickable to players. then an effect the click will do when conditions are met. you can also make animations to appear when the click happens.
[2:31:18] KairuruTV: @fillway they just need to make slightly smaller servers instead of relying on layering
[2:31:20] Pixiepantss: Adge
[2:31:35] skizzington: nice haircut
[2:31:46] zen_oni_shinobi: just trying to see how it would be similar to changing in game wow like UO.
[2:32:05] ogMansoN: im on my wod account right now, logged on retail to see the actual  title i got from rbgs "guardian of the aliiance"
[2:32:09] KairuruTV: ive been thinking on joining in on the legacy launch, i havent playing UO since i was 14 yrs old lol
[2:32:09] babyjay1313: WHAT?
[2:32:15] babyjay1313: Take my card now
[2:32:30] ogMansoN: top 3%, not very good
[2:32:33] soapbargoeshard: do you think they even know about the lag in stv
[2:32:37] Ethantren: Ethantren subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 6 months, currently on a 1 month streak! yeee
[2:32:42] babyjay1313: UO was my shit
[2:32:49] KairuruTV: should do a huge stream season of UO launch
[2:32:56] fillway: you can also basically extend a server's capacity by splitting a virtualized instance/layeracross multiple servers, you can pretty much increase cpu capacity infinitely w/ a vm
[2:33:15] KairuruTV: just make this the old school mmo channel XD

[2:36:44] 3c3c_: GIGACHAD warrior for life
[2:36:47] jschroe3: glutton for punishment
[2:36:48] Selecktt: Man I REALLY want to make an affliction lock because they look like they're going to be an absolute monster next phase. But I've been a fury main for 15 years. Feels wrong to not be a warrior.
[2:36:49] CwoodAGG21: yeah SoD is getting a little over whelming in pvp now. it’s like self torture
[2:36:55] MaybeCallMe: how far did you make it on your SSF warriors?
[2:37:18] Wunz_Y: whens japan my man @SONII

[2:37:54] drengark: Dont use it man
[2:37:57] ogMansoN: just say stfu in ab see what happens
[2:38:01] Selecktt: SSF is just the original ruleset for the unofficial hardcore prior to official realms. I got a warrior to 60 during that. its doable. just not fun lol.
[2:38:02] jschroe3: not buying gold tho Kappa
[2:38:03] RamosaTV: @SONII I finished solo leveling today and im convinced i just read peak.... so excited for you to finish bro

[2:38:18] Wunz_Y: doesnt make any sense that imorph would be tos anyway
[2:38:19] Tyfonius: ban you for using imorph and only THEN give warriors cool shit
[2:38:24] astronomiculeu: They started banning people for tmorph :)

[2:39:20] creaturesfan72: they ban if you tmorph mining nodes
[2:39:38] fillway: they banned some people a few years ago who were using it to modify the size of mining nodes or something, savix was talking about it yesterday and had it installed today

[2:42:56] nwdelz: leveling enh right now was going to suggest time to relevel
[2:43:00] Gillbawk: shaman
[2:43:01] probsstoned: no more +30%dmg when using 2 of the same weap
[2:43:03] KairuruTV: i mean, its only level 40, you can just reroll and be ahead of 80% of the server in a couple weeks
[2:43:06] B_Rize: warrior feels god awful

[2:43:18] aequitas987: there any link to the playlist

[2:44:23] Selecktt: I have an aoe farming slut mage that I use to fund my warrior. I am leveling a rogue alt. but thats about it.

[2:54:12] GregWasTaken: you read berserk?
[2:54:19] Selecktt: I found the amount of gore in an anime is directly proportional to its quality
[2:54:25] GregWasTaken: berserk is peak manga
[2:54:36] cheeto_mans: fair
[2:54:44] whoopsiepoopsieman: Some of these newer animes are just not vibing with me. They are all action and thats it

[2:55:09] NawtyTyme: if u read bleach second how would that go?
[2:55:12] Vitticus: i dont get too deep into it, but it does feel like bleach. where its more focused on how cool the characters look and fight scenes vs actual storyline
[2:55:19] pilgrim69: vinland saga just turned into farm simulator though
[2:55:22] brownfiesta: skipped 1000? DansGame

[2:56:28] GregWasTaken: dressrosa was nuts
[2:56:35] GregWasTaken: he skipped to fucking Wano
[2:56:44] zen_oni_shinobi: i hear edibles get people super fucking high
[2:56:45] TheDyslexicGamer: dressrosa sucks

[2:57:07] ogMansoN: he waas afk in org and i farted in his face

[2:57:08] sirdavvos: zoro is top 10 anime characters
[2:57:14] Tyfonius: dressrosa is where the anime slowed to a crawl
[2:57:22] ithen7: @SONII I would really like to see u smth like rog/mag, smth with more pvp pontential and tricky. Have you even thought of rerolling?

[2:58:40] Selecktt: In disbelief you havent read berserk. it's one of the quintessential 3 goals mangas. DBZ, Baki, and berserk.
[2:58:45] Tyfonius: @SONII they're remaking the anime from the start soon, probably gonna be a lot fewer episodes
[2:59:00] zen_oni_shinobi: https://www.pinterest.com/pin/803822233496005117/ wall tapestry behind my tv.

[3:17:01] 113nik: MOP
[3:17:01] brownfiesta: yes 100%
[3:17:02] Deatharmor98: @MattOriginal MUCH AGREED
[3:17:03] GTokie: wrath was legendary
[3:17:03] AlphaSimply: Cata underrated
[3:17:05] unselfish123: cata classic arena will be LIT
[3:17:06] 1710gandalf: ya
[3:17:07] vLowa: tbh i never played cata, but wotlk i been on alot
[3:17:07] KTrillzTV: Same
[3:17:09] camslam: CATY ALL DAY
[3:17:09] GordanRamseyGaming: wrath and BC blew TBH
[3:17:10] GregWasTaken: he who must not be named pack
[3:17:10] Taazzer: cata > wrath any day
[3:17:10] rapsody27: I think they are both ass
[3:17:10] B_Rize: Anything after TBC is complete dog ass
[3:17:12] GTokie: watch ur mouth tan boy
[3:17:15] KairuruTV: Vanilla WotLK > Classic Cata > Classic WotLK
[3:17:15] Dreamvillain23: cata is objectively better than wrath
[3:17:16] womboski: wrath is more annoying to keep up with @sonii its a lot easier to gear alts
[3:17:20] iBanEvader: @SONII I think draenor raids were amazing
[3:17:21] zen_oni_shinobi: i personally think i need to stop setting my expectations high enough to be dissapointed with blizzard games.
[3:17:22] iBanEvader: LUL
[3:17:23] BrotherDanTV: Both TBC and WOTLK were pretty trash tbh
[3:17:24] CAD604: pvt srv andys ruined wotlk and there's been less pvt srv cata... fingers crossed
[3:17:25] tsetse2fly: @SONII why do you feel this way? What makes cata>wrath
[3:17:30] brownfiesta: classic cata will be worse you just dont know it yet
[3:17:31] vLowa: only thing i do in wotlk is icc now
[3:17:37] itsjake92: cata copium
[3:17:45] Selecktt: Loved cata. But I honestly dont think it should be included in "classic". They literally changed the world. it aint really classic
[3:17:50] BIGxTPx23: @SONII i think the lighter hair color makes you look tanner
[3:17:50] Vitticus: nah, probably new viewers. its the stereotype for bodybuilders
[3:17:52] ogMansoN: depending when it comes out id prolly play. i quit raiding in cata phase 1
[3:17:57] 3c3c_: LUL
[3:18:02] ogMansoN: wotlk phase 1^
[3:18:05] camslam: Cata is just a better Wrath, like triple AAA blizzard's golden age , produced giga content at the time
[3:18:07] Nightbot: instagram.com/Sonii // Twitter.com/Sonii // youtube.com/Sonii
[3:18:09] GregWasTaken: I don't have expectations for new games in general
[3:18:10] JonasDM_HS: holy moly i was gifted a sub
[3:18:11] KairuruTV: but cata was actually super fun until they started nerfing everything imo
[3:18:14] JonasDM_HS: cool
[3:18:16] dft_kekwplays: warriors are more fun in cata :P
[3:18:19] BroccoliTom: LOL
[3:18:20] iBanEvader: hunter energy bar!
[3:18:27] iBanEvader: rogue combo points
[3:18:34] TheEndIsNear777: i quit late vanilla and came back late mop. So when i tried wrath i was like "too bursty like retail :( "
[3:18:35] iBanEvader: classes will be way more fun to play
[3:18:39] KairuruTV: what i LOVE about cataclysm is that the 10 and 25 mans share a lockout
[3:18:44] KairuruTV: so i dont have to raid 12034 times a week
[3:18:46] MattOriginal: think I'm over Vanilla reboots.  Ready for Cata
[3:18:47] BroccoliTom: i like cata warrior
[3:18:49] vLowa: wotlk is just raid logging rn

[3:19:02] GTokie: i got tired of ulduar so bad
[3:19:05] ewokkin: LUL
[3:19:07] Vitticus: yeah playing up to trials of the crusader wasn't all that great. what was great was quitting and then coming back for icc
[3:19:07] vLowa: nah we all do icc
[3:19:08] theonlypadrejoe: wotlk is SOOO overrated
[3:19:09] averyjames_: thats  facts

[3:19:31] camslam: Cata had SO much unique content, plus switchable specs
[3:19:32] vLowa: cant wait for pre patch
[3:19:33] Legendarian22: is that sonii or itadori
[3:19:41] ogMansoN: cata launch dungeons were really hard, then they watered it down
[3:19:44] camslam: Dragon SOul was a good ass time
[3:19:50] Gillbawk: SAME

[3:20:17] Patchette15: show me ur pvp runes pls
[3:20:18] endo474: I woke up today getting little squirts of liquid on my face…. it kinda started things off weird.
[3:20:29] ogMansoN: yeah it wasnt easy
[3:20:32] KairuruTV: before nerfs yeah the raids were relatively difficult
[3:20:33] limburgse: ye
[3:20:35] broughtpain: in your defense, Zin'rokh was one of the best 2 handers
[3:20:36] KairuruTV: then in firelands they nerfed it
[3:20:36] Chemleak: Healing ramps up in difficulty in cata for sure
[3:20:37] MattOriginal: Raiding difficulty in Cata was a big boost above Wrath
[3:20:37] iBanEvader: it only gets harder each expansion
[3:20:38] Noz831: I got my first legendary in Cata - the staff on my ele sham
[3:20:41] zen_oni_shinobi: ven collektiv and snutz won blizzcon that year though
[3:20:45] vLowa: firelands looks so fun
[3:20:48] limburgse: dragon soul wasnt easy aswell, some bosses
[3:20:50] CAD604: for some classes
[3:20:56] BrotherDanTV: They won't be hard now, it was just a step up from WOTLK > Cata
[3:21:00] ogMansoN: i played rogue, it was snd 5 rupture
[3:21:00] averyjames_: TRASH
[3:21:02] KairuruTV: LOL
[3:21:08] B_Rize: classic is fun because raids are easy and we can pump without trying to be a gigachad
[3:21:09] Selecktt: Cata arms warrior is literally #1 dps
[3:21:11] CAD604: lol
[3:21:14] Taazzer: tentecal sword + arms warrior slap tho
[3:21:16] KairuruTV: time to rebrand
[3:21:17] TheDyslexicGamer: wipe it out
[3:21:21] rapsody27: rbgs were actually really fun and competitive
[3:21:30] Rugmouse: embrace the shaodws, play rogue
[3:21:31] glueater_x: they just need to fix rage gen
[3:21:35] BroccoliTom: please tell me xmog is in cata
[3:21:42] MattOriginal: Arms Warrior was big damage,  pumped super hard in Dragon Soul
[3:21:45] iBanEvader: hp just needs to be buffed way more
[3:21:49] iBanEvader: not only in stv
[3:21:51] Deatharmor98: WARRIOR GETS A STUN WITH THROWDOWN YESSSSS
[3:21:55] KairuruTV: i love rbgs, because i hate arenas
[3:21:55] Selecktt: Stay arms for cata. It's the best dps in the game. Then drop arms after that lel
[3:21:56] zen_oni_shinobi: i was mildly disappointed when they didn't have classic arena tournaments at blizzcon.
[3:21:57] iBanEvader: like 40% more hp

[3:32:20] BroccoliTom: @SONII how far is the bear, and do i have aggro?
[3:32:24] zen_oni_shinobi: thing about bears is that if you don't kill it in 1 shot you royally piss it off and make it worse
[3:32:25] TheDyslexicGamer: what would guts do
[3:32:26] CAD604: give the bear the grenade, hes gonna need it

[3:33:03] erawin1990: if ur trained u could wait a certain amount of time and throw it like u do in halo
