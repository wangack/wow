[1:15:02] doomwh1sp3r: RWF Classic ToC took like 20 minutes or something
[1:15:05] doomwh1sp3r: LUL
[1:15:05] Nightbot: LUL
[1:15:06] MrCrippels: what does he mean with dialed up?
[1:15:29] BipolarPongal: Asmon sounds like the salty ex that's jealous of your progress after the break up
[1:15:57] doomwh1sp3r: Back in the day was so cool, seeing Naxx geared chars
[1:16:08] Kemskemss: @BipolarPongal ‘’I want her to be happy but in a different way!’’
[1:16:10] kaverrr: Mythic raiding should only give cosmetic items. There I said it.
[1:16:14] lillwerpan: tuning bosses the way asmon wants would destroy raiding for  like top 500-1000 guilds
[1:16:18] tannerazm: Not tmog. Tmog for life... Kappa
[1:16:18] s_t_o_r_m__: yup
[1:16:37] BipolarPongal: @Kemskemss KEKW
[1:16:45] stillsuitstk: I couldn't kill Sindragossa when she was relevant sayuwuSwipe
[1:16:59] stillsuitstk: no lich king for me
[1:16:59] ALiGPK47: players will find ways to make things competetive. In classic with speed running raids becoming min/maxed for example
[1:17:02] Hozzar1: Mythic shouldn't give items only cosmetics
[1:17:37] jujumann35: but people who have that mindset don't want to get better, they want the game to get easier so they can feel better
[1:17:49] frexzl: I just want 10man raiding again Shruge
[1:17:49] Oryaki: We need for more RWF / MDI etc. it's great entertainment and supports top-notch players... how Blizz support the regular player enjoying the content is a completely different topic and shouldn't be confused with this.
[1:18:21] elsnickito: @Scripe Hi, have you checked out the gw2 rwf?
[1:18:22] MrCrippels: that's why we have three different "levels". Go for the level you find fun/challanging
[1:18:43] Kemskemss: six months till next RWF Desperage
[1:18:43] Hozzar1: I think raiding should go 10 man
[1:18:46] ohlszon: in my younger years i strived for  becoming better nowdays i just play to have fun with mates tbh
[1:19:04] kaverrr: I think the problem with Mythic raiding and boss difficulty really shows when the players in a guild have varying skill levels. It can be very frustrating for the better players and it's hard to find 20-25 players that are all the same skill level.
[1:19:04] stillsuitstk: Vulperas are the problem
[1:19:18] Egzolinas: I think World First Race should be in a seperate difficulty higher than Mythic and rewards just cosmetics and never nerfed. That can solve most of the problems.
[1:19:18] stillsuitstk: remove Vulperas
[1:19:18] Echo_Esports: Yooo i yoinked a Staforge PC. Best choice of my life . Go yoink yours at: echogg.ly/starforge/Scripe
[1:19:22] Hozzar1: Scripe avoiding ff ultimates xffing
[1:19:29] brandogzz: So you think mythic is not too hard and the amount of addons required too play this game is healthy?
[1:19:42] BipolarPongal: These events would let newcomers or old players alike to choose what game mode they'd like to play. It's a game at the end of the day
[1:19:43] Kemskemss: @MrCrippels four? -) lfr exists!
[1:20:03] BipolarPongal: Scripe ruined LFR for me Madge
[1:20:03] EppatTV: because he thinks that the game was not designed originally for any competitive aspect lol
[1:20:08] Vtal: Lol is a lobby game and wow is kinda becoming one
[1:20:11] noirlol: m+ asweLL KEKW
[1:20:17] BipolarPongal: ??????
[1:20:22] frexzl: ?? KEKL
[1:20:23] yujik46: jesus what a take
[1:20:24] stillsuitstk: ELDEN RING WHEN?!?!?!?!?!?!?!!?
[1:20:26] EppatTV: "stop having fun" KEKW
[1:20:28] noirlol: brainded npc take
[1:20:28] maplelost: chess is competitive what
[1:20:30] sinclsw23: why not?
[1:20:39] stillsuitstk: ELDEN RING COMPETETIVE WHEN?
[1:20:43] BipolarPongal: VERSUS
[1:20:45] Gorthol217: "its not the game i wanna play" is what he is really saying KEKW
[1:20:52] Bladetykon: cooked to hard
[1:20:59] MrCrippels: @Kemskemss forgot about that :)
[1:21:07] frexzl: People are better than me Madge
[1:21:17] maplelost: wow just has a super high skill ceiling
[1:21:26] EppatTV: that is a problem with matchmaking, not with the game itself KEKW
[1:21:27] jayzukee: this game is out for over 20 years ofc there is good players? :D
[1:21:45] Thdlock: guys i figured out hte take
[1:21:46] kaverrr: Just play BM hunter or Ret pala and go brrrrrrrrrrrrr
[1:21:58] Thdlock: people are bad and they cant accept it
[1:21:59] Oryaki: After RWF just implement M+ scaling to keep it interesting for people... Let's be honest most people don't get CE anyways
[1:22:03] Thdlock: so they blame others
[1:22:05] Thdlock: EZ
[1:22:08] BipolarPongal: EZ
[1:22:15] ohlszon: This is a casual view he has, he's never played anything competetive Asmon that is
[1:22:23] LuiBMHunter: thd for president?
[1:22:24] BipolarPongal: Guys, I'm bad at the game, let's blame the game instead 5Head
[1:22:25] noirlol: BASED
[1:22:37] s_t_o_r_m__: hard to beat 12 years xp
[1:22:44] noirlol: and when u are bad, just do heroic, ez fix
[1:22:45] s_t_o_r_m__: more even
[1:22:59] maplelost: they got tobo now its jover
[1:23:11] EppatTV: @Thdlock based
[1:23:13] kaverrr: Take: The content that matters in WoW is either super easy or super hard.
[1:24:08] Bladetykon: its like you get a new job and complain that the person that worked there for 0 years is better than you at the job
[1:24:12] phili161: phili161 subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 40 months! 
[1:24:13] StreamElements: phili161 just subscribed for 40 months in a row PogChamp
[1:24:19] brandogzz: Addons is the biggest issue and the amount of them you need everyone should have the same UI like league
[1:24:21] Echo_Esports: Time for a break...from your current job? Come work with Echo! Apply at: echogg.ly/apply/Scripe
[1:24:25] maplelost: his solution is WoW 2
[1:24:29] noirlol: he is just talking shit
[1:24:29] ohlszon: YEP
[1:24:30] Milanesa_De_Pollo: monkaS
[1:24:31] Cmde: ban good players!
[1:24:32] yujik46: asmon seems to just offer criticism with no solution to improve what hes talking about
[1:24:33] Kemskemss: @Bladetykon I’m sure there’re ppl like that xd
[1:24:35] Thdlock: he wants a wow 2
[1:24:35] Joschi174: nowayS
[1:24:37] Thdlock: but he wont realize
[1:24:40] Thdlock: thats the same shit
[1:24:48] noirlol: WoW2 KEKW
[1:24:49] Thdlock: as if skill doesnt trasnfer
[1:24:50] BipolarPongal: duh
[1:24:52] Aketzali: Dungeon trash mechanics are bloated. Actionbars are bloated. Crafting is bloated.
[1:24:52] frexzl: He isnt here to make a solution, his goal is to complain and get views
[1:24:55] Thdlock: from a call of duty 3 to a call of duty 47
[1:25:05] Thdlock: a counter strike go to a counter strike 2
[1:25:10] Thdlock: are an overatch to overwatch 2
[1:25:11] Thdlock: xdd
[1:25:13] BipolarPongal: What Thd said
[1:25:14] kaverrr: He wants PvP (toolkits etc.) to be designed based on RBGS and not pro arena teams.
[1:25:24] stillsuitstk: Freaking pro players, I never realised how bad are you!
[1:25:31] tannerazm: LETHIMCOOK
[1:25:33] stillsuitstk: Now i know
[1:25:35] aftergl0w: NOTED
[1:25:36] tankeern: can anyone explain me what is the difference between releasing expansions of the old game compared to a WoW 2? why would there ever be a WoW 2?
[1:25:47] maplelost: its so funny how wow players have to take this clowns opinion seriously because he has the loudest voice
[1:25:49] Joschi174: nowayNotiz
[1:25:56] BipolarPongal: shrujj
[1:25:56] SpendYouFire: notee
[1:26:02] BipolarPongal: KEKW
[1:26:08] Bladetykon: I think Classic and sod are even worse with the background checks ppls do before they invite you into a raid
[1:26:09] Milanesa_De_Pollo: true KEKW
[1:26:16] stillsuitstk: sayuwuDot
[1:26:16] kaverrr: He's not wrong on this one
[1:26:21] Thdlock: so lets take a guess guys
[1:26:25] noirlol: ????
[1:26:27] Thdlock: when does balance matter
[1:26:31] BipolarPongal: He's talking about "MMO" as a whole
[1:26:31] Thdlock: at the top
[1:26:36] stillsuitstk: Balance 1v1 duels instead
[1:26:40] ohlszon: It is
[1:26:41] Thdlock: i can play yuumi top
[1:26:43] Thdlock: in bronze
[1:26:46] Thdlock: and 1v9
[1:26:47] Milanesa_De_Pollo: RBG scene is really bad to get into, no solo queue
[1:26:55] frexzl: @kaverrr ofc he is wrong
[1:27:00] ewevix: balance for world pvp
[1:27:06] noirlol: im lost the whole video
[1:27:12] ohlszon: 5vs5 was only to get Easy glad
[1:27:13] kaverrr: @Thdlock If you play on EU ping you'd probably win
[1:27:14] ohlszon: nothing else
[1:27:20] Bladetykon: he wants rbg because there it wont matter that much if he sucks since it is 10v10 and not 3v3
[1:27:24] Vtal: Arena has become popular because rewards were warranted to it
[1:27:29] BipolarPongal: 2-3-5-10 man content is more desirable in modern wow. He's just stuck in the past
[1:27:49] dracullatv: yeah he wants RBG so he can be carried by viewers
[1:27:49] EppatTV: ????
[1:27:50] noirlol: ye he lives in the past, cant let go KEKW
[1:27:50] Thdlock: single player game KEKW
[1:27:52] BipolarPongal: ICANT
[1:27:53] dracullatv: KEKW
[1:28:04] mk__9: no but that makes it a one weekend game
[1:28:12] mxfelwinter: like...i used to prefer battlegrounds during wotlk back on the day, but it not being rated was the reason for it (being able to 3 vs 1 on the chaos of a BG with my rogue)
[1:28:25] BipolarPongal: Listening to this for the 2nd time, bro was cooking big time
[1:28:43] tankeern: classic and fun in same sentence?
[1:28:45] EppatTV: if they made the game simpler he would complain that the game is too easy KEKW
[1:28:53] Echo_Esports: Gear up for raid with a world-class sitting experience. Enjoy the same long-lasting comfort as Echo, only with the Secretlab TITAN Evo gaming chair: echogg.ly/secretlab/Scripe
[1:29:06] noirlol: asmon is a normal/heroic raider, perfect for him
[1:29:07] TheRatPresident: not too sure about that
[1:29:08] maplelost: normal mode aberrus was hard for him
[1:29:10] kaverrr: Depends on his raid team
[1:29:16] iahn_GR: Well the bar isnt that high
[1:29:18] mxfelwinter: he doesnt like to struggle either
[1:29:19] Vtal: @scripe why isnt rwf on tournament realm?
[1:29:22] EppatTV: he just want to complain and farm views with that lol
[1:29:28] TheRatPresident: he wants gear and he doesnt want to face the fact that he is bad at the game
[1:29:29] kaverrr: Hard bosses are fun when the entire team have the same skill level
[1:29:30] BipolarPongal: He's mad his friends can't boost him to Gladiator anymore because player skill
[1:29:49] sydale: where do you draw the line for "good player"?
[1:29:50] frexzl: @noirlol his fragile ego can't take not being able to do the hardest difficulty though
[1:29:52] Kemskemss: anyone knows if Asmon is on the side of WoW being seasonal game or 24/7 game?
[1:29:57] mxfelwinter: he want loot, not challenge. this is why he hate not being to do mythic raiding
[1:29:59] ZippoIsFreeFromJail: @TheRatPresident he dont play the game since Legion...so yeah he is bad
[1:29:59] Firelord_Trolldemort: I think mythic is good how it is. I do not understand the asmongold mindset
[1:30:00] mxvan: a few years ago this guy was applauding elitism @scripe
[1:30:05] noirlol: you have 3 gamemodes and complain KEKW stuck to normal/heroic
[1:30:08] mxvan: in raiding
[1:30:17] TheRatPresident: @ZippoIsFreeFromJail thats not even remotely true
[1:30:25] maplelost: 3 day rwf
[1:30:39] juraj93: my only problem with mythic rading is fixed 20ppl we as guild are super bad we killed 4 mythic bosses but half of the time we dint raid caz this guys kid is sick this guys need to be with wifet etc thats the worst part @Scripe
[1:30:44] BipolarPongal: Just go Emerald Nightmare and call it a day
[1:30:47] EppatTV: I mean, he wants that
[1:30:59] ZippoIsFreeFromJail: @TheRatPresident you never watched asmons streams then
[1:31:24] TheRatPresident: @ZippoIsFreeFromJail yawn bro, he played prolly 1k+ hours of bfa, played hundreds of hours of shadowlands, even played some DF
[1:31:43] GameChampTCG: i dont understand why asmon reacts to wow content when he literally hasnt played wow in like over a year
[1:31:43] Sorgenkind87: idk why ppl still listen to asmond talking about wow. this guy is crying over everything since idk 8 years
[1:31:49] GameChampTCG: he is so out of touch
[1:31:58] noirlol: i wish i could 10man pug mythic without a id lockout and only have loot lockout but having 20man and 10man is hard, would be sick tho
[1:32:04] Oryaki: Everybody watching wants to see guilds struggle and learn in RWF....
[1:32:07] tankeern: Goodtake
[1:32:09] tankeern: Kappa
[1:32:10] elephonk: olympics, train whole life, run 100 m larstmSad  in 10 seconds, lose
[1:32:11] tankeern: not
[1:32:15] dracullatv: KEKW 󠀀
[1:32:19] EppatTV: he's a great actor, we can say that KEKW
[1:32:24] noirlol: he has problems
[1:32:33] frexzl: WoW is living rent free in his head for some reason
[1:32:34] ohlszon: He enjoys watching it he says that himself but ye
[1:32:38] Kemskemss: @GameChampTCG I meeeean, he’s in touch of his audience and those ppl play wow too. I don’t know if it’s a good thing tho xd]
[1:32:45] BipolarPongal: @EppatTV KEKW Keeps looking at chat after the dramatic poses
[1:32:46] Matthew_4W: if he thinks it's the worst, why does he sponsor it :P ?
[1:32:50] Thdlock: wait u mean
[1:33:02] noirlol: his chst is not playing and he is lot playing
[1:33:06] Thdlock: the biggest event on one of the to pstreaming sites
[1:33:07] noirlol: chat
[1:33:08] EppatTV: @BipolarPongal it's a bunch of TRUEEEE
[1:33:09] Echo_Esports: Save up to 35% and level up your stream with Elgato! Get started today : echogg.ly/elgato/Scripe
[1:33:11] BipolarPongal: o7 sponsor
[1:33:14] Thdlock: that earns blizzards thousands of dollars in resubs
[1:33:18] Thdlock: isnt succesful
[1:33:20] Thdlock: WHAT
[1:33:34] mk__9: why do people who dont raid mythic care about its difficulty? dont we have 4 different difficulties so people can play what suits them?
[1:33:35] luizog1000: the race itself is
[1:33:37] LuiBMHunter: liquid is heh heh :)
[1:33:40] EppatTV: I mean, he's saying nobody cares about the race
[1:33:42] BipolarPongal: what does he mean KEKW
[1:33:42] maplelost: bdgg
[1:33:47] kaverrr: I think RWF is good for the game but I do agree that Mythic raiding is too hard. Both things can be true.
[1:33:51] noirlol: casuals can do normal/heroic ??? KEKW
[1:33:59] Aketzali: In Shadowlands people did not have time to help guildies, because they had to do a crap ton of max. level m+ dungeons for the great vault. On top of that, dungeons in Shadowlands were designed so that mistakes griefed the entire group (explosions and pulsating damage). These changes were made for elitist jerks.
[1:34:02] TheRatPresident: i think he does have a point tbh, if the game was not designed and tuned for the top 0.1%, the game would be much more accessible for a larger player base
[1:34:05] luizog1000: but it makes the game worse for the lower mithic groups
[1:34:14] ahri_feet_connoisseur: I like WotLK system. normal and heroic, that’s it
[1:34:14] noirlol: facts
[1:34:18] Thdlock: heres the reality
[1:34:20] Thdlock: if your trash
[1:34:21] Thdlock: and u lose
[1:34:23] Thdlock: u cant accept it
[1:34:29] noirlol: wow people are entitled to clear mythic bro what
[1:34:30] BipolarPongal: Watching the whole meme/hype around Halondrus, Anduin etc. and NA vs. EU got me back into the game after years
[1:34:48] tannerazm: YEP
[1:34:48] mxfelwinter: because they want BiS loot, for them raiding is about loot, not the encounters
[1:34:50] kaverrr: @thdlock you're*
[1:35:00] luizog1000: @Scripe basicaly asmon is saying the game is not assecible
[1:35:00] Nikz1_: so true
[1:35:01] noirlol: accept u r trash and only do normal/heroic
[1:35:04] Thdlock: o shit grammar police Pog
[1:35:06] MrXanderOG: Locking the loot so you can't trade it if you don't own the item will make the race longer since you can't gear that fast. Right?
[1:35:08] kaverrr: kekw
[1:35:09] frexzl: @TheRatPresident but it isnt designed for the 0.1%, normal and heroic exists
[1:35:09] ahri_feet_connoisseur: yeah but that problem doesn’t exist as much with normal + heroic in WotLK
[1:35:12] lungtv: This debate is so chewed up already, mythic raiding doesnt effect a pleb casual like me at all - keep moving people - stop blaming echo liquid and blizzard
[1:35:13] luizog1000: because race to world first tuning
[1:35:17] Thdlock: i will never do proper grammar bud
[1:35:40] Kemskemss: tbf people who can’t accept they’re somewhat bad, don’t have skills to realise it’s you-problem and not world problem xd
[1:35:43] frelyah: what u pushing bud
[1:35:46] mk__9: doesnt make sense yeah
[1:35:48] rawhammer89: I'd just like if you wouldnt have to be a mythic player to have access to bis stuff for m+. Its possible without
[1:35:50] rawhammer89: just funner to have
[1:35:56] Decahhhh: There's no difficulty on ER
[1:35:56] BipolarPongal: Didn't games since forever had difficulty modes
[1:35:58] brandogzz: Yes its ruining the game, mythic is too hard cus its tuned for 2 guilds
[1:36:01] ahri_feet_connoisseur: I think 4 difficulties is too much. Hard mode is fine but just do that, not 4 different difficulties
[1:36:07] TheRatPresident: @frexzl the barrier of entry to the game is inaccessible, because the game is designed to use a million addons, such as DBM
[1:36:12] Firelord_Trolldemort: it’s like hitting masters or even grandmasters in a moba then you try out for a competitive team. you realize you are not as good as you thought you were
[1:36:21] Aketzali: The alternative to play hard is to play another game, not to play normal.
[1:36:23] luizog1000: @Scripe basicaly asmon is saying the game is not assecible bacause of race to world first tuning
[1:36:28] TheRatPresident: @frexzl and there is not a very large percentage of the playerbase that does HC raiding, and even normal
[1:36:29] Oryaki: If you don't getting CE is doesn't make you trash... it's one game after all and most people play and sub because they enjoy the game... even when it's painful at times grinding
[1:36:35] mxfelwinter: it's because hardest difficulty drop the best loot, that's the whole thing, it's not about team or personal challenge
[1:36:36] Thdlock: the solution is titanforging bro 4Head
[1:36:41] mk__9: @rawhammer89 you dont want the game to feel 3 separate games inside one. thats bad.
[1:36:50] Hozzar1: time for me farm exp in ff15 EZ
[1:36:58] noirlol: barrier of entry is not that high, just goggle a bit for basic addons and u go from there, it's not rocket science
[1:37:03] luizog1000: like i don't see how people can defend boses that literaly mathematicaly impossible on release
[1:37:06] frelyah: Well my ideal is for wow raids to have a normalized diffeculty that just rewards with cool flashy titles or transomg cinda like hell mode in lost ark
[1:37:07] BipolarPongal: I agree. Felt good when World Quest items titanforged
[1:37:10] frexzl: @TheRatPresident How is normal/heroic inaccessible?
[1:37:11] luizog1000: that just baffles my mind
[1:37:16] ewevix: i think the problem is more that you dont need raid at all with m+ for gear except for a few % more
[1:37:19] Hozzar1: @noirlol i think it's the fact people shouldn't be forced into doing it.
[1:37:25] ahri_feet_connoisseur: why is thdlock is in every wow chat when there is a hot take going on
[1:37:30] tankeern: i don't want to raid, but m+ only monkaW
[1:37:31] kaverrr: Everyone is bringing that up LUL
[1:37:37] Karnaged: This isn't very much related to the topic but I say this every chance I get, I wish mythic was available to 10 man groups after hall of fame is full.
[1:37:40] IamFlizzey: Its the same thing as if you would blame the UFC cause you cant compete in title matches, with training once a week and a physic of a 6 yrs old ..... people cant except that others can be better than themself and not everything is achivable for one
[1:37:45] MrXanderOG: Locking the loot so you can't trade it if you don't own the item will make the race longer since you can't gear that fast. Right? 󠀀
[1:37:52] tannerazm: What do you think of this? There is no other content to prove yourself with other than raiding/pvping. Such that, if you had some casual end game that wasn't raiding/pvping, you have an avenue to prove yourself. So now you have people who want the only content that they can do to prove themselves to be easy so they can do it.
[1:37:55] stoutside: theres no way id go back to mythic raiding it just requires way too much time
[1:38:06] rawhammer89: agree, its not the difficulty. its about time investment and investment in guild and such.
[1:38:09] TheRatPresident: @frexzl if you have to download 5-10 third party software programs to play a game, that is inaccessible to new players
[1:38:26] frexzl: @TheRatPresident for normal you do not need that
[1:38:27] Zuriyah: @stoutside Not that much after you get gear you need
[1:38:29] ahri_feet_connoisseur: I agree time investment for mythic is so crazy
[1:38:37] mk__9: @TheRatPresident do you really "have" to?
[1:38:39] BipolarPongal: @MrXanderOG they'll just make 9 chars

[1:38:54] rawhammer89: If you only want to pug 2-3 lvls bellow max completed keys you can, its just that you'd feel more satisfied if all gear was available to you. That includes tetriary stats!
[1:39:06] Firelord_Trolldemort: well at the end of the day the only thing that matters is player skill when you get to end game mythic raid bosses or high mythic plus. no amount of gear will help you live a 1 shot
[1:39:08] TheRatPresident: @mk__9 yes, you pretty much do. no guild will reqruit any players without addons, regardless of their skill level
[1:39:26] MrXanderOG: Yes, but for me as a viewer, the longer the better. But i agree it's harder for the competing guilds
[1:39:36] TheRatPresident: @mk__9 go look at the discord of a 3/9 HC guild, do you think they do not have DBM, WA etc requirements? they do
[1:39:40] luizog1000: @Scripe basicaly asmon is saying the game is not assecible ti wilder audience because if rtwf tuning
[1:39:53] Gorthol217: "its not the game i wanna play" is what he is really saying KEKW 󠀀
[1:39:53] resku89: well splits needs to go
[1:39:54] Kemskemss: @mk__9 you kinda do, cause otherwise game is way harder for you and why would u want it as a new player already?
[1:40:02] mk__9: @TheRatPresident yes but a new player you're not going to a semi serious guild "on entry". its gonna take a long time before u reach that point.
[1:40:05] IamFlizzey: Its the same thing as if you would blame the UFC cause you cant compete in title matches, with training once a week and a physic of a 6 yrs old ..... people cant except that others can be better than themself and not everything is achivable for one
[1:40:06] Hozzar1: @Scripe why not crafted gear replaying boes?
[1:40:08] Hozzar1: or splits
[1:40:08] luizog1000: but they are shit easy
[1:40:09] brandogzz: 20+ addons are required and thats super cringe
[1:40:10] IamFlizzey: sorry had ads :(
[1:40:12] Thdlock: want to make it more accesible
[1:40:13] s_t_o_r_m__: Maybe he's not good enough to raid Kappa
[1:40:14] Thdlock: its really easy
[1:40:16] Gorthol217: i dont get why the first change people demand for mythic raiding is not lifting all these useless restrictions like the lockout and server restrictions i just wanna play the game and not look for a guild and commit to playing every week forever
[1:40:18] brandogzz: addons are ruining the game like nothing else
[1:40:19] Thdlock: delete raid buffs
[1:40:28] TheRatPresident: @mk__9 yes, and that makes the game not very accessible. that is my point exactly
[1:40:30] tannerazm: True
[1:40:31] Thdlock: delete the lockout
[1:40:31] MaskieHuh: @Thdlock based
[1:40:42] BipolarPongal: Shruge
[1:40:44] Hozzar1: @Thdlock delete locktout make it loot lockout?
[1:40:45] mk__9: holy BASED
[1:40:46] Eliannoula: KEKW
[1:40:47] mk__9: get good noobs
[1:40:48] holla____: xddcat
[1:40:49] maplelost: he doesnt want solutions, he wants to complain
[1:40:50] mk__9: BASED scripe
[1:40:54] cidc0m: BASED
[1:40:58] s_t_o_r_m__: lockout is fine, just get legacy gear in the game
[1:40:58] frelyah: yea thats gonna trigger people
[1:40:59] BipolarPongal: Just git gud 4Head
[1:41:03] mk__9: exactly
[1:41:03] s_t_o_r_m__: play more alts
[1:41:03] luizog1000: like compare to xiv
[1:41:09] BipolarPongal: Yeah, let me operate. Trust me, I'm good
[1:41:10] noirlol: based
[1:41:11] luizog1000: top was released
[1:41:12] Firelord_Trolldemort: if they delete raid buffs just bring full raid of warlocks @thdlock
[1:41:16] EppatTV: he's just a lazy person
[1:41:18] elderkain: very good point Scripe, good job
[1:41:26] mxfelwinter: scripe, for them it isnt about clearing the hardest fights, it's about getting the highest iLVL gear
[1:41:28] RasnerG: They won't Even invite You If You are good and play somethingnyou enjoy but is bot meta
[1:41:34] rawhammer89: Battleress and Bloodlust do inpact the "meta" a bit to much yes. Those two could use a revamp. Like bringing a boomie for bress is like, well its the boomie we need to ress.
[1:41:34] frexzl: @TheRatPresident ofc, they are a mythic guild
[1:41:34] ahri_feet_connoisseur: to be honest even heroic raiding is a pain in the ass so I just outright quit wow
[1:41:35] Echo_Esports: Grab your fantastic new Displates for up to 33% off! Use echogg.ly/displate/Scripe and enter code: ECHO
[1:41:37] RasnerG: Off
[1:41:40] Arrcon: but you do see that in league your character doesnt progress? @Scripe
[1:41:42] luizog1000: and u can pug ultimates on final fantasy
[1:41:46] Oryaki: Echo going to offer medical services on the website next?
[1:41:46] TheRatPresident: @mk__9 becoming good at this game doesnt just revolve around playing the game and being good at the game, it requires third party software as well which is ridiculous. you cant play this game at a half decent level without multiple addons that are not even part of the game. that is not good game design
[1:41:48] Avarizz: brother only complains about this when it comes to wow, not when it come to path of exile or        league of legends
[1:41:51] maplelost: we addressing asmons opinion not the poster LOL
[1:41:51] luizog1000: and the clear rates are good
[1:41:53] kaverrr: I think it would be healthy for all RWF raiders to be placed on a team full of shitters after they finish the race each tier. So they can see the struggle 😂
[1:42:02] Santaceso: I think the ideal is bosses be more like FFIV (like tyndral, less gear demand and more mechanical skill. With that, more people/guilds can try kill bosses but the top guilds will continue RWF. And adding to this, no addons like weakauras, like who today raids without addons?
[1:42:11] MrXanderOG: But there will always be a meta, no matter what
[1:42:14] luizog1000: and the omega protocol is way harder than mithic
[1:42:20] frexzl: @TheRatPresident then you are just bad rofl what is this take
[1:42:25] Arrcon: character progression is time spent farming which is the whole discussion about doing raiding when you wanna do m+ @Scripe
[1:42:38] frelyah: @Santaceso ff14 is 8man tho the main issue is wow being 20 getting 8 ppl compared to 20 is way way easier
[1:42:39] Kemskemss: @frexzl it’s a take about new players. chill
[1:42:39] ahri_feet_connoisseur: yeah at the end of the day WoW being super hard is just not a game for me any more. it’s too much
[1:42:39] brandogzz: Tell what other games requires you too use addons like wow thats a good game??
[1:42:40] GameChampTCG: players got better. game needed to evolve
[1:42:40] ZippoIsFreeFromJail: WOW is not MC only :D
[1:42:43] luizog1000: but the clear rate is higher because there are way less barriers of entry
[1:42:45] noirlol: asmond is stuck in the past in tbc
[1:42:52] TheRatPresident: @frexzl i guarantee you that I achieved much more than you at every aspect of this game man, so relax. its not about skill, its about understanding game design
[1:42:53] frexzl: @TheRatPresident acting like wow is freaking rocket science lmao
[1:42:53] tannerazm: Some people like Asmongold didn't get better
[1:42:57] IamFlizzey: @Scripe isnt it the key factor of an RPG/MMORPG or kind of any game, to start bad and get better over the time to face more challenging content? I dont get how people dont enjoy their own journey on their on speed...
[1:43:02] ahri_feet_connoisseur: well not everyone has time investment to put into WoW
[1:43:03] stoutside: skillflation
[1:43:06] s_t_o_r_m__: exactly
[1:43:17] koalahug1: to busy getting carried
[1:43:18] EppatTV: the elite keeps getting way better, but the general population is staying at the same level
[1:43:25] Zuriyah: FInally someone said it ... Asmo is just cry baby
[1:43:27] ahri_feet_connoisseur: especially when you grow up you have less time to invest
[1:43:30] IamFlizzey: @ahri_feet_connoisseur then dont expect to do the hardest contents
[1:43:39] Hozzar1: @Scripe let's use some of the final fantasy 14 solutions, crafted boes, change lockouts to loot lockouts, smaller raid size but i can understand you'd have to rework the whole game, anymore ideas you have
[1:43:42] kaverrr: I mean the game is just not very good if you don't play it on a high level. The casual content of retail wow sucks ass.
[1:43:50] s_t_o_r_m__: prob is more people don't want to play with him? LUL
[1:43:56] ohlszon: its a reason the game is dying year by year KEKW
[1:44:10] Vtal: Im multiple times diamond in lol since s2 and m+ 0.1% several times and based on my exp, wow skill is totally artifical because of existing addons wa and horrible ui for the complexity of the game
[1:44:13] ahri_feet_connoisseur: @iamflizzey yeah I don’t, I simply don’t play at all
[1:44:18] noirlol: most mythic guilds only raid 9h per week, this is super casual
[1:44:22] Santaceso: @frelyah ok...but the logic is demand less gear and addons, be more coordination and skill
[1:44:23] stoutside: i think the seasonal formulae kinda invalidates gear that why i dont think he cares to do it
[1:44:28] Aketzali: I have so many excellent games installed on my PC that it is making me stressed. I don't have the time to play wow that I had 10 years ago.
[1:44:28] frexzl: @TheRatPresident Im sure you have buddy, dont choke too hard while being under asmon's desk m8
[1:44:31] stillsuitstk: emove vulperas!r
[1:44:33] mk__9: alkXD
[1:44:34] aftergl0w: D: my pets
[1:44:39] Eliannoula: not the pet battles!
[1:44:45] TheRatPresident: @frexzl i cant stand asmon, but that doesnt mean that everyhthing he says is wrong
[1:44:46] rawhammer89: if pet battle was needed for race, that would be bad though
[1:44:47] s_t_o_r_m__: so much time wasted on pet stuff Kappa
[1:44:47] Avarizz: that stream asmon did was unhinged, he was in general too vage with his takes and in generel who think about what he likes wow to be.
[1:44:48] Echo_Esports: Celebrate Echo's latest win in the RWF with the New World First mousepad and loads of other great merch at echogg.ly/merch/Scripe
[1:44:48] resku89: What is race to world  first happens on premade characters, everyone has the same gear
[1:44:50] Vtal: @scripe Im multiple times diamond in lol since s2 and m+ 0.1% several times and based on my exp, wow skill is totally artifical because of existing addons wa and horrible ui for the complexity of the game
[1:44:56] Artem_V: so truue, get the pokemon shit OUT of my mmo
[1:45:04] IamFlizzey: @ahri_feet_connoisseur so you dont play the game, because you cant play the hardest content? Maybe its not the right game for you then - and that totally ok
[1:45:10] mk__9: true
[1:45:11] mk__9: alkXD
[1:45:16] holla____: xdd
[1:45:30] Cavox: I think he meant "don't design the raids for top 1% of guilds who take part in RWF", not "remove the ability to do RWF entirely"
[1:45:34] luizog1000: @Scripe like compare mithic to ultimates in ff the clear rates on ultimates are way higher even tho they are just as hard, because there are less barriers to enter to get to the content
[1:45:34] BipolarPongal: BASED Nephew
[1:45:36] kaverrr: I think the question is more how much of the design is based on the competitive scene
[1:45:41] Firelord_Trolldemort: @scripe I think they should remove the bell curve style difficulty and do a more linear one
[1:45:44] frelyah: and
[1:45:45] IamFlizzey: based
[1:45:48] frelyah: that is why people are quiting
[1:45:51] s_t_o_r_m__: Or just dont play the game
[1:45:54] gublins93: What if mythic raiding will not give any loot.Isnt that the best solution?
[1:45:54] frelyah: they dont enjoy it yea
[1:45:59] Hozzar1: @Scripe let's use talk some solutions instead, i'll use some final fantasy 14 solutions, crafted boes, change lockouts to loot lockouts, smaller raid size but i can understand you'd have to rework the whole game. Also books when you kill bosses so you don't get fucked via rng.  anymore ideas you have.
[1:46:05] mxfelwinter: because he want mythic difficulty rewards, if mythic didnt rewarded higher iLvl gear than heroic, he wouldnt complain about it
[1:46:06] Kemskemss: I can see Scripe saying to his nephew: ‘’Just gid dug. Me in your age...’’
[1:46:09] IamFlizzey: people expect to pay 12,99 and get everything they want
[1:46:18] TheRatPresident: fun is subjective, not a hard concept to understand
[1:46:18] Hoxza: Or you just be chillin in Heroic and enjoying that
[1:46:28] tinitot: thing with asmon he takes all loot for himself and mates the moans that he cant do mythic raids   thats a skill issue
[1:46:35] ohlszon: Bingo!
[1:46:42] brandogzz: REMOVE ADDONS is the selutions
[1:46:42] Vtal: @scripe Im multiple times diamond in lol since s2 and m+ 0.1% several times and based on my exp, wow skill is totally artifical because of existing addons wa and horrible ui for the complexity of the game
[1:46:42] noirlol: id lockout so i can pug freely
[1:46:44] maplelost: Just make a WoW ultimate for cosmetics and prestige and leave mythic gear for the noobs
[1:46:45] aftergl0w: YoshiSmirk Clap
[1:46:47] brandogzz: then you can make the bossers easier
[1:46:47] ahri_feet_connoisseur: the point is WoW has been catered to the 0.01% with addons and weakauras and crazy mechanics in m+
[1:46:49] Cavox: removing all addons is the first step to fix WoW, but it will never happen.
[1:46:51] ewevix: also hurts the experience of everyone
[1:46:52] stillsuitstk: WoW 2
[1:46:54] EppatTV: wait for the addon take KEKW
[1:46:58] kaverrr: The 21st man (scripe and max) is also a big factor
[1:47:02] Hozzar1: which of the stuff do you agree with?
[1:47:03] stillsuitstk: Time for WoW 2
[1:47:03] BipolarPongal: There's other things to do in the game that's not as challenging as Mythic raids. Not sure how complaining about a game mode helps
[1:47:07] Psyquest: Better default UI and kill addons  that read buffs/debuffs
[1:47:08] Hozzar1: be pragmatic
[1:47:08] frexzl: @Cavox because addons have ALWAYS existed for wow
[1:47:09] Thdlock: my ui is built like a brick
[1:47:10] sinclsw23: Blizzard would have to design a proper UI
[1:47:11] resku89: That you need a designated weakauras guy for RWF is wild
[1:47:12] IamFlizzey: @ahri_feet_connoisseur its not, weakauras, uis etc. are accessable to everyone in one point
[1:47:14] luizog1000: @Scripe like compare mithic to ultimates in ff the clear rates on ultimates are way higher even tho they are just as hard, because there are less barriers to enter to get to the content
[1:47:19] TheRatPresident: @frexzl hope you are listening little guy
[1:47:20] ahri_feet_connoisseur: it won’t happen because blizzard are too scared to do it
[1:47:25] noirlol: @ahri_feet_connoisseur bro you are cooked like asmongold, dont play the game then, play something else
[1:47:26] Echo_Esports: Yooo i yoinked a Staforge PC. Best choice of my life . Go yoink yours at: echogg.ly/starforge/Scripe
[1:47:27] holla____: no
[1:47:27] ohlszon: Yeah
[1:47:28] maplelost: fack no
[1:47:28] Branura: no
[1:47:28] Psyquest: I would play
[1:47:29] EppatTV: fuck now KEKW
[1:47:29] brandogzz: yes
[1:47:29] Hoxza: yes
[1:47:30] dracullatv: nope
[1:47:30] frelyah: i need a dps meter tho
[1:47:31] aftergl0w: Yeah
[1:47:32] ahri_feet_connoisseur: yes
[1:47:33] DoggoGG: NO
[1:47:33] Firelord_Trolldemort: I would
[1:47:34] szpulka_: no xd
[1:47:34] ZippoIsFreeFromJail: YEAH
[1:47:34] ahri_feet_connoisseur: 100% yes
[1:47:36] stillsuitstk: If they add shaman tanks
[1:47:38] Vtal: Yes
[1:47:39] dracullatv: my UI would be fcked up
[1:47:39] brandogzz: DPS METERS is the only addon allowed
[1:47:39] iahn_GR: same 100%
[1:47:40] Karnaged: Recently did a no addon challenge and had a blast
[1:47:43] Vtal: Fuck them
[1:47:43] ewevix: no
[1:47:46] TheRatPresident: DPs meters is a must, but otherwise would love if the game was less dependant on them
[1:47:48] Arrcon: the moment raidtools are gone im out
[1:47:49] Thdlock: i only play lost ark currently becuase it has dps meter
[1:47:51] Thdlock: most ppl do
[1:47:52] Aketzali: I loved making my own WeakAuras in wow.
[1:47:52] Thdlock: KEKW
[1:48:01] Avarizz: fuck no, bk in the days when i got my first quest helper instead of going on tottbot to see the quest info i was so happy
[1:48:04] Firelord_Trolldemort: I would play Aug and tell people I’m too damage
[1:48:04] ohlszon: Lost ark KEKW
[1:48:06] Artem_V: Patricia completely agrees
[1:48:06] Thdlock: same with ff without dps meter KEKW
[1:48:11] stoutside: theyd have to improve the base line pvp ui
[1:48:12] Blaknwyt: could prob handle no dps meters, but logs would be a killer
[1:48:12] mxfelwinter: @luizog1000 the reason is because people prog ultimates for even years, instead of abandoning the ultimate as soon as the "season" is over
[1:48:14] drakiksha: I would love to see ban of addons and reducing complexity of mechanics in Raid. So mechanics would be easier to deal with but you don't have addon telling you where and when to go
[1:48:19] Santaceso: UI addons like elvui yes, meters/dbm/weakauras out
[1:48:20] Arrcon: bro if ppl are assigned tranq and dont do it i wanna see that
[1:48:23] brandogzz: People who are saying addons are good for wow do not play the game or they smoking crack
[1:48:29] Thdlock: i wish efvery boss mod addon was gone
[1:48:29] ewevix: the bosses have to be easier , or telegraph abilities better, but thats also good
[1:48:29] dracullatv: raid tools gone is okay but removing UI addon and force me to use half-assed remake they did in DF would be end for me
[1:48:33] tinitot: how much longer would world first take with no weakauras or dbm say ?
[1:48:34] luizog1000: @mxfelwinter and u can pug then esaly
[1:48:36] Hoxza: ye if they implement DPS meters in there basic UI
[1:48:40] tannerazm: The endgame is based around raiding/pvp. If you add a casual endgame (like a house cosmetic endgame) then those players could flex in other ways and they could decouple the experiences between you, the one percenter and them.
[1:48:42] TheRatPresident: @frexzl where did you go man? not gonna tell scripe hes asmons bitch for having this take?
[1:48:43] Thdlock: to really show the people who cant recognize things
[1:48:46] G4nriu: WA just nhave to go...
[1:48:56] luizog1000: @Scripe like compare mithic to ultimates in ff the clear rates on ultimates are way higher even tho they are just as hard, because there are less barriers to enter to get to the content
[1:49:05] Hozzar1: i prefer talking solutions instead of bitching about the game to be honet
[1:49:08] Takeido: i mean, you measure your performance by "Boss=dead?" or "Phase change= reached?"
[1:49:11] TheRatPresident: gladius
[1:49:11] ohlszon: just play PoE if u want indepth
[1:49:15] GameChampTCG: elvui
[1:49:18] LuiBMHunter: mdb
[1:49:20] LuiBMHunter: ermm
[1:49:22] LuiBMHunter: dbm
[1:49:24] ItsToxicQT: Just let me keep elvui @scripe
[1:49:29] ahri_feet_connoisseur: only dps meters for me. that’s it.
[1:49:29] kaverrr: I think most 5/9 guilds could get CE within a month if they had Max as a raid leader. He's basically making it so the players don't have to think :P
[1:49:33] keli_q: plater
[1:49:36] Hoxza: Its nice that u can personalize your look of your UI
[1:49:45] tinitot: remove weakauars   dbm   race would be longer
[1:49:47] ahri_feet_connoisseur: I could play with everything removed except dps meters
[1:49:47] TheRatPresident: yes
[1:49:49] Cavox: I have no solution for dps meters. I agree they're important for self-improvement, but they do introduce the "parse > all" mentality.
[1:49:49] Hoxza: like frames and such
[1:49:50] TheRatPresident: and DRs
[1:49:59] frexzl: @TheRatPresident rofl, nah I just dont wanna argue with someone who started playing wow less than 5 years ago who understands nothing about the game.
[1:49:59] stoutside: baseline pvp ui is soo bad
[1:50:15] frexzl: @TheRatPresident but keep it up bro
[1:50:17] TheRatPresident: @frexzl did you not hear scripe literally repeating what I said?
[1:50:19] TheRatPresident: rofl
[1:50:25] EppatTV: addons are fine in the open world and stuff, just remove them from mythic raid
[1:50:28] Hozzar1: @frexzl you two stop please
[1:50:28] mk__9: people play mobas with cds trackers
[1:50:29] Blaknwyt: hard to imagine a world without WA from UI, tracking X and then just content support
[1:50:30] Firelord_Trolldemort: I would to see the people who rely on rotation helpers play with out it
[1:50:35] kaverrr: @Cavox Imagine doing 6 months of farm raiding without parsing
[1:50:38] ewevix: the fact you even need ti know the dr of other pps ccs is kinda the problem tho
[1:50:43] stillsuitstk: lol
[1:50:45] Thdlock: idc bout parse i care bout improvement
[1:50:51] LuiBMHunter: have your parses ever been bad?
[1:50:55] Thdlock: without ever seeing it
[1:50:56] xodo1313: thats something ive only seen in classic
[1:51:06] Cavox: because you play with people who aren't retards, but there are a lot of people who will intentionally wipe the raid if they can't have a high parse.
[1:51:12] y217i: damn i just got the mythic gul dan mount
[1:51:13] brandogzz: DPS meters should be in the base game from blizzard its a obvious good thing for the game , rest of the addons removed
[1:51:19] Kemskemss: removing meters but leaving logs is a nice middleground. ppl who cba to figure out logs don’t need them. ppl who do get what they want
[1:51:22] noirlol: in classic people only parse KEKW
[1:51:25] ahri_feet_connoisseur: I don’t think there’s any issues with dps meters. it’s mainly the dbm/weakauras that has been so problematic with making raids so much harder
[1:51:26] dracullatv: some talents are not even remotely trackable on basic UI. For example SKB for fire mages ... imagine playing that without WA tracker KEKW First improve basic class mechanics to be more visible on screen in default UI, then think about removing addons
[1:51:27] luizog1000: @Scripe like compare mithic to ultimates in ff the clear rates on ultimates are way higher even tho they are just as hard, because there are less barriers to enter to get to the content 󠀀
[1:51:29] BipolarPongal: It's like how people get called shit since they're low on meters but are doing prio damage and helping the group
[1:51:46] xodo1313: yea i have always wondered why they didnt have a base dps meter like they do in Battlegrounds
[1:52:00] ahri_feet_connoisseur: yeah then that’s on Blizzard to make those UI improvements to be visible
[1:52:16] ewevix: ye dropping addons has to come with full skill/ui rework
[1:52:16] Echo_Esports: Time for a break...from your current job? Come work with Echo! Apply at: echogg.ly/apply/Scripe
[1:52:31] elsnickito: @Scripe Hi, sorry for spamming this question, have you checked out the gw2 rwf?
[1:52:35] sfia: clipped and shipped
[1:52:35] maplelost: its jhust  the barrier
[1:52:35] Alegral: in pvp you meet so many bots theese days specially in solo shuffle are they problem in pve as well ?
[1:52:43] BipolarPongal: @sfia KEKW
[1:52:44] luizog1000: lot of people
[1:52:54] Firelord_Trolldemort: warlock soul shards would be so scuffed without addons
[1:53:06] maplelost: do u want 40 man raiding back
[1:53:10] Thdlock: @Firelord_Trolldemort ?
[1:53:36] Gorthol217: there is gear nerf
[1:53:37] brandogzz: @Firelord_Trolldemort The fact that u need addons too play your class is the issue itself
[1:53:46] Gorthol217: its not big but its there
[1:53:51] ahri_feet_connoisseur: just play arcane mage you press the same sequence of buttons every single time xdd
[1:54:22] viktorsergaming: Id hate to loose plater and how much i can customize it
[1:54:27] ahri_feet_connoisseur: lmao
[1:54:35] BipolarPongal: o7 sponsor
[1:54:38] holla____: xddcat
[1:54:47] Oryaki: Scripe do you think you're constantly improving as a player yourself (setting aside addons etc.)?
[1:54:58] Dandinga: what was that game he was playin
[1:55:05] Firelord_Trolldemort: well if you had no addons to display the information for example how many soul shards I have. I do not even know were they show you your soul shards  in game
[1:55:06] Hozzar1: i can kinda agree with this
[1:55:07] ewevix: hes also reaction farming, i dont think he actually cares about respones xD
[1:55:13] Artem_V: ???
[1:55:14] ahri_feet_connoisseur: I think people are in agreenace with this take no
[1:55:15] Kemskemss: why the fuck is it even an issue
[1:55:17] maplelost: i cant defend that
[1:55:36] Kemskemss: by that logic no balance patches either. never. only of the launch of expac
[1:55:46] BipolarPongal: shrujj
[1:55:50] tannerazm: Him
[1:55:52] Firelord_Trolldemort: like it shows up above my characters head
[1:55:52] sfia: dont think thats to do with designing for rwf specifically but more to do with wow being ridiculously hard to balance period lol
[1:55:52] GameChampTCG: tune it for ASMONGOLD
[1:55:53] stillsuitstk: For me
[1:55:56] luizog1000: @Scripe 3984 characters cleared top
[1:55:59] GameChampTCG: ASMONWOW
[1:56:01] Dandinga: i rather have a boss nerfed then have a emerald nightmare raid
[1:56:04] brandogzz: The middle player
[1:56:04] ahri_feet_connoisseur: for the 99.9% of people
[1:56:04] KrystelCandy: The hardest content in the game shouldnt need to be nerfed 12 times
[1:56:05] Oryaki: Nerfing bosses after RWF is just Blizz making the game the top tier more accessible for more people... what's wrong with that?
[1:56:09] Hozzar1: @luizog1000 wait really
[1:56:15] GameChampTCG: buff warior 500%
[1:56:15] luizog1000: yes
[1:56:17] BipolarPongal: He farms mounts, what does he expect
[1:56:20] holla____: If i clear mythic in one week i aint playing this game anymore
[1:56:22] TheRatPresident: @Kemskemss you`re not getting the point. balance patches are ofc needed when they fuck up, his point is that they are intentionally not balancing it
[1:56:22] KrystelCandy: when bosses have nerfs as large as 20% hp drops, 50% damage drops, that shouldnt exist
[1:56:25] Lorrdzik: like classic difficulty
[1:56:26] noirlol: 30k clear rate in TOP overall on ALL data centers
[1:56:27] ZippoIsFreeFromJail: for his chat :X cuz hard to play with them
[1:56:32] ewevix: besically everyone except elite players obv.
[1:56:32] Honeycrispie: who do u think the game should be balanced around?
[1:56:45] luizog1000: characters
[1:56:48] Echo_Esports: Gear up for raid with a world-class sitting experience. Enjoy the same long-lasting comfort as Echo, only with the Secretlab TITAN Evo gaming chair: echogg.ly/secretlab/Scripe
[1:56:53] jurashh: I dont agree with this at all. What they are doing currently is nerfing the bosses slowly so that guilds that are less good can kill the bosses, this way everyone gets a challenge
[1:56:54] Hozzar1: @noirlol this unique chatacters?
[1:56:54] Assmaster2k: The tuning is great atm, if it was 2 easy game would be dead
[1:56:54] ahri_feet_connoisseur: challenger in league is 0.1%, for example, and you can say RWF is challenger. blizzard likes to tune for rwf no?
[1:57:11] luizog1000: the pug scene is very health
[1:57:18] elirank9: Should be tuned the same way it is in the end of the tier
[1:57:20] Kemskemss: @TheRatPresident no? he’s complaining about bosses being nerfed in general
[1:57:21] tankeern: i have 6 YEP
[1:57:22] Artem_V: I think the gradual nerfing is cool, makes it accessible to both sweaty nolifers and more players
[1:57:23] maplelost: 1 of that is me i paid 500 last week
[1:57:36] Artem_V: I don't see how nerfing the boss is seen as a failure to balance
[1:57:41] luizog1000: not just groups a lot of these kills are pugs
[1:57:45] luizog1000: c41
[1:57:48] frexzl: jeez, I wonder why the mythic difficulty that is not meant to be for everyone, is not balanced for everyone
[1:57:55] ohlszon: KEKW
[1:57:55] Artem_V: -sponsor
[1:57:56] BipolarPongal: o7
[1:57:57] TheRatPresident: @Kemskemss no man... hes saying its illogical that bosses are overtuned intentionally on release, to provide content for RWF
[1:58:00] ohlszon: was about to say same KEKW
[1:58:00] ahri_feet_connoisseur: o7
[1:58:01] shnelmax: o7
[1:58:06] KrystelCandy: its not, because wows gearing process is wildly more RNG based than FFs, everyone has BIS going into ultimates
[1:58:08] ZippoIsFreeFromJail: o7
[1:58:09] aftergl0w: -1 sponsor
[1:58:10] Hozzar1: it had 2 nerfs
[1:58:10] holla____: o7
[1:58:10] tankeern: starforge = asmon?
[1:58:10] maplelost: 1% nerf
[1:58:16] ZippoIsFreeFromJail: -1 bridge
[1:58:17] Kemskemss: @TheRatPresident and I’m asking why is it an issue ffs
[1:58:19] ahri_feet_connoisseur: o7 starforge
[1:58:22] iamwodan: HE DOESNT KNOW KEKL
[1:58:26] luizog1000: not nerfs bug fixes
[1:58:29] Hozzar1: no one in p8s and one in heavensward?
[1:58:30] sfia: i wouldnt call them nerfs lmao
[1:58:30] frelyah: and how long does the ff14 RWF last lmao
[1:58:33] noirlol: bug fixes really
[1:58:33] KrystelCandy: TOP had bug fixes, not nerfs
[1:58:34] ewevix: o7
[1:58:35] frelyah: like 1 day
[1:58:36] frexzl: Nah ff14 never has balance patches Kappa
[1:58:36] TheRatPresident: @Kemskemss thats fine, but you clearly misunderstood the message
[1:58:50] aftergl0w: Classic p1
[1:58:50] Cavox: I remember Yoshi-p profusely apologizing for needing to nerf something back in the day.
[1:58:52] maplelost: it was harder before u killed it Kappa
[1:58:53] Kemskemss: @TheRatPresident do casual players want to rush into mythic on release? hell no. And stop telling me what I understood and what I didnt
[1:58:55] luizog1000: no
[1:58:55] KrystelCandy: P8S had a 1% nerf
[1:58:56] sfia: they made 2 autoattacks happen later after boss spawns in the fight
[1:58:57] KrystelCandy: to the boss HP
[1:58:59] KrystelCandy: not TOP
[1:59:02] luizog1000: p8s had 1 pércent
[1:59:23] Nightbot: @noirlol -> Questionable judgement. [stop posting links] [warning]
[1:59:25] KrystelCandy: he was auto attack killing healers before he was targetable
[1:59:27] mxfelwinter: the other reason scripe, is that people prog ultimates even when they are "outdated" content, there are people still proging DSR since it launched for example
[1:59:28] KrystelCandy: thats it
[1:59:56] maplelost: WoW needa make ulktimates
[2:00:05] TheRatPresident: @Kemskemss thats a perfectly fine argument, unlike your first one
[2:00:08] luizog1000: @Scripe i need to make clear a lot of clear are just pugs
[2:00:13] brandogzz: Yeah tindral/fyrakk was perfectly tuned scripe not like trindral got a 40% hp nerf
[2:00:22] BipolarPongal: I miss the times where people would afk in Orgrimmar with cool gear or titles
[2:00:22] luizog1000: of people helping 1 and 2 people clear the fight
[2:00:28] Artem_V: classic cata soon
[2:00:30] Thdlock: even lost ark has those blizzard is just slow with that shit classic
[2:00:31] luizog1000: when they get to the finish line
[2:00:38] Kemskemss: @TheRatPresident it wasn’t even an argument. You misunderstood my point
[2:00:44] stillsuitstk: ban him!
[2:00:51] KrystelCandy: didnt Tindral get a massive nerf on week 2 of the race? like a 20% hp cut?
[2:01:04] Echo_Esports: Save up to 35% and level up your stream with Elgato! Get started today : echogg.ly/elgato/Scripe
[2:01:23] brandogzz: @KrystelCandy tindral got like 20 nerfs
[2:01:25] s_t_o_r_m__: Wow needs more innovation
[2:01:38] Thdlock: @KrystelCandy fun fact he didnt actaully need that nerf but they wanted hte boss to die like 2 days earlier xdd
[2:01:44] s_t_o_r_m__: If I see more swirlies I'm gonna cry
[2:01:46] BipolarPongal: But the skill gap is crazy, no? on certain mechanics. Like, do you think guilds outside top 5-10 would do seeds with 3 seconds
[2:01:53] ahri_feet_connoisseur: imagine id there was one single difficulty tuned to be semi difficult for the 99%,  and one “challenge mode” for RWF that only gave cosmetic rewards, thoughts?
[2:01:55] Psyquest: Fyrakk soaking in transition is STUPID
[2:02:01] Psyquest: cant do it without weak aura
[2:02:11] tinitot: be good to have you and max together to discuss this
[2:02:18] GameChampTCG: get rid of PTR
[2:02:23] ahri_feet_connoisseur: what bosses are good examples?
[2:02:35] s_t_o_r_m__: there is one puzzle in swtor and people still don't know it after 12 years LUL
[2:02:38] ahri_feet_connoisseur: yeah no PTR is what made SoD so hype too
[2:02:44] iamwodan: also private aura that just to get solved by a macro is shit
[2:03:03] CallMeSval: sod is nowhere near as hard as raiding in retail dont compare
[2:03:10] halfwaythug: nice beard man PridePog
[2:03:14] ahri_feet_connoisseur: yeah season
[2:03:42] Psyquest: There is nassive difference between lowering the difficulty and piss easy. you are exagerating.
[2:03:51] ahri_feet_connoisseur: not knowing rune locations in SoD and watching random streamers try to figure it out was super fun
[2:04:12] ArroArroArro: Make Mythic be no gear and only a challange for the best in the world to defeat. Could even be only 4-5 mythic bosses, ignore the first half of the raid cause thats just harder heroic bosses.  Achievments, mounts, transmog and bragging rights should be enough.
[2:04:24] s_t_o_r_m__: If you wait a patch you have enough stats for boss Kappa
[2:04:30] enigmasvea: oh no not another brainrot asmon takes video
[2:04:41] KrystelCandy: improving gear is not the same as nerfing bosses by 20-30%
[2:04:54] txcrakt: wanna do 29 dht
[2:05:03] IAmJoey: wrong statement
[2:05:04] lillwerpan: @ahri_feet_connoisseur How do you tune for 99%? Like if you tune for top 1000 guilds there would still be tons of ppl that doesnt step a foot in mythic because its to hard.
[2:05:08] Artem_V: fundamentally disagree
[2:05:12] Kemskemss: can we have a gamble if we’re finishing this video today? xd
[2:05:13] ahri_feet_connoisseur: I think getting Mimiron’s head for doing challenge mode is the coolest way to do it”mythic” difficulty for example
[2:05:19] s_t_o_r_m__: Seems like a personal bubble statement
[2:05:30] BipolarPongal: KEKW
[2:05:33] maplelost: THERE IT ISS
[2:05:35] Honeycrispie: Yep
[2:05:36] ohlszon: There it is KEKW
[2:05:38] iamwodan: THERE WE GO
[2:05:39] verrbatim: jesus christ
[2:05:44] sselesu: That was a joke i think
[2:05:47] BipolarPongal: o7 sponsor
[2:05:48] s_t_o_r_m__: sheesh I was right
[2:05:52] ewevix: no its not a joke
[2:05:54] ohlszon: No its not
[2:05:55] Lorrdzik: it was not
[2:05:55] IAmJoey: its not
[2:05:56] tinitot: loot for him and his mates
[2:05:57] ArroArroArro: rewind it
[2:05:57] s_t_o_r_m__: NOT A JOKE
[2:05:57] maplelost: naw yo thats his mentality
[2:05:58] Honeycrispie: that is not a joke
[2:05:59] iamwodan: it was not
[2:05:59] tannerazm: ABSOLUTELY NOT A JOKE
[2:05:59] tankeern: it was not, he have always been in it for loot
[2:05:59] enigmasvea: asmon also havent played since legion KEKW
[2:05:59] ohlszon: he is the same in classic
[2:06:00] KrystelCandy: asmon only cares about loot, that doesnt invalidate the post or his points
[2:06:02] Avarizz: that was not a joke
[2:06:02] Hozzar1: o7 good bye sponsor
[2:06:05] ahri_feet_connoisseur: @lillwerpan I think what WotLK did is a good example in geneal
[2:06:05] jirkamcz: hehe :D now its clear ;) we are doing raid for satisfaction from beating boss not for loot loot is just mean to achieve it
[2:06:07] KrystelCandy: he is a loot goblin
[2:06:13] tannerazm: Not even 0.01% of a joke
[2:06:17] Dandinga: asmon cares 99% about loot
[2:06:19] Lorrdzik: but tbh I think many people just raid for loot
[2:06:21] ahri_feet_connoisseur: o7 no more starforge
[2:06:23] tannerazm: He literally only cares about loot man
[2:06:23] Honeycrispie: if you watched asmon back in the day you know thats not a joke hes a literal goblin
[2:06:28] BipolarPongal: Echo is no longer sponsored by Starforge o7
[2:06:30] s_t_o_r_m__: he's called asmonGOLD
[2:06:32] TheRatPresident: it can be a joke and still be true
[2:06:35] Honeycrispie: when he raided he didnt give a shit about prog just give him all the loot KEK
[2:06:58] ohlszon: There is a reason why the meme i need that is popular
[2:06:59] noirlol: KEKW
[2:07:00] Artem_V: Pog shadowlands
[2:07:00] ohlszon: its from asmon himself
[2:07:03] holla____: xddcat
[2:07:08] iamwodan: I don't like to work hard for progress, I just want the loot BrokeBack
[2:07:12] noirlol: BASED
[2:07:13] frexzl: bald man mad he cant get the best gear anymore
[2:07:18] tannerazm: Here's the problem. He wants the new loot.
[2:07:25] Aketzali: He wants to be able to big-dick mobs.
[2:07:27] stoutside: what about progressing on a boss you dont like
[2:07:40] ewevix: getting loot will give a dopamine hit, getting a weekly raidnerf does not
[2:07:42] s_t_o_r_m__: He can't get the best gear because raids are to hard to pug.
[2:07:49] tannerazm: He doesn't ONLY care about loot. He wants the best loot. Doesn't care how he gets it, just wants the best loot.
[2:07:55] BipolarPongal: ICANT
[2:08:06] Honeycrispie: Ye
[2:08:07] TheRatPresident: hahah
[2:08:10] iamwodan: very true
[2:08:10] BipolarPongal: Can someone make a private server for Asmongold
[2:08:11] IAmJoey: that is what pvp used to be
[2:08:11] Artem_V: don't we all
[2:08:11] Dandinga: 100%
[2:08:14] ArroArroArro: he has said that multible times, that he did that back in the day
[2:08:16] ahri_feet_connoisseur: as an Asmon viewer that’s exactly true LOL
[2:08:22] noirlol: he doenst like m+ and he doenst like raiding, its just not his game anymore, move on
[2:08:22] tinitot: didnt he get boosted on sylvanas
[2:08:25] enigmasvea: Love how a man can have so many takes about a game he havent played for 7 years KEKW
[2:08:55] ahri_feet_connoisseur: I mean don’t  we all want to do the swifty 1 shot dream in pvp
[2:08:58] lillwerpan: @ahri_feet_connoisseur Ok, but you do realize that it is probably only like 20%, you be killing like top 1000guilds with that
[2:09:04] s_t_o_r_m__: YUP
[2:09:08] iamwodan: yup
[2:09:08] tannerazm: YEP
[2:09:11] Avarizz: he would be mind blown
[2:09:12] tulumz: 100%
[2:09:24] halfwaythug: are you saying future meeres is gonna be like asmon XD
[2:09:31] Echo_Esports: Grab your fantastic new Displates for up to 33% off! Use echogg.ly/displate/Scripe and enter code: ECHO
[2:09:31] s_t_o_r_m__: He should go raid and not give a fuck about streaming
[2:09:37] Honeycrispie: bro got filtered by botanist LUL
[2:09:44] ahri_feet_connoisseur: @lillwerpan sorry not getting what you’re saying that well, I think MoP is also another good example of good tuning
[2:10:06] ArroArroArro: he has the money to game 17 hours a day for the next 20 years so
[2:10:06] Artem_V: yes, but Meeres puts the effort
[2:10:08] s_t_o_r_m__: SHEESH I want to watch that!!!
[2:10:09] tannerazm: LMAO
[2:10:11] maplelost: he would be the best bench warmer
[2:10:13] iamwodan: he has a rank 1 parse on staraugar Kappa
[2:10:46] IAmJoey: zskarn last seaosn
[2:10:56] iamwodan: zskarn YEP
[2:11:02] IAmJoey: HOF guilds killed zskarn so much different
[2:11:09] BipolarPongal: PauseChamp
[2:11:13] stoutside: you guys raised the bar so high the average asmon cant visualize themselves reaching that level so they give up and try to tear down the difficulty
[2:11:24] BipolarPongal: HUH
[2:11:50] noirlol: funny thing: he liked the game in legion but it the same now KEKW he is delusional, he can't move on from the game
[2:11:50] ahri_feet_connoisseur: hey I asked that in his chat
[2:11:57] lapsietv: what i dont understand is why do they need to make mythic for everyone just do heroic ??
[2:12:05] BipolarPongal: They should remove LFR and add another tier after Heroic like Emeral in League xddcat  @Scripe
[2:12:09] kaverrr: Bosses should have simple-to-understand mechanics like Sludgefist and Halondrus
[2:12:24] ZippoIsFreeFromJail: @BipolarPongal and u will remove half of the casual players
[2:12:27] sfia: so the level cap should never go up?
[2:12:32] ahri_feet_connoisseur: Never
[2:12:32] enigmasvea: ???
[2:12:32] sfia: because hes saying that right now
[2:12:32] Artem_V: just get everything correct from the start 4Head
[2:12:34] IAmJoey: bad take
[2:12:36] frexzl: @lapsietv Fragile ego go boom when they cant do the most difficult thing
[2:12:48] enigmasvea: gl getting everything correct instantly KEKW
[2:12:49] ewevix: i think think he means that, thaty would make no sense
[2:12:49] rawhammer89: Difficulty is fine, there should be affixes and power creeps in place for mythic raid to have RWF players show us how high you can go. But loot should be easier to aquire so loot-andy (me) can get what they want and still be happy.
[2:12:53] TanknPray: Ultimates in 14 have this problem too
[2:13:00] CallMeSval: just be perfect at developing perfect content for everyone 4Head
[2:13:00] ahri_feet_connoisseur: if razsageth never got nerfed for rwf would it have been better?
[2:13:01] BipolarPongal: @ZippoIsFreeFromJail I suppose the question would be what is considered casual these days
[2:13:05] s_t_o_r_m__: Swtor has that, I rather have new content!
[2:13:12] maplelost: gw2 does that. raiding died
[2:13:13] IAmJoey: that is what I like about osrs
[2:13:15] Aketzali: That would be fun.
[2:13:16] Sleephen: @Scripe What do you think if they made best gear available in heroic and m+ and make it so only rewards from mythic were cosmetic similar to how FF does with ultimates. The entitled don't feel like they need to do it and the people that want to still get a challenge.
[2:13:23] ZippoIsFreeFromJail: @BipolarPongal lfr and mythic 0 dungeons
[2:13:34] CallMeSval: @maplelost raidint died cause they didnt develop it enough
[2:13:42] CallMeSval: not cause it didnt get nerfed
[2:13:44] CallMeSval: terrible take
[2:13:44] kaverrr: I kinda liked going on world tours for legendaries in Legion
[2:13:57] brandogzz: BY removing addons they have too make the raids easier so its a win for everyone
[2:13:58] patrikuzis: @Sleephen but savage gives the actual relevant loot, and heroic is entirely incomparable to savage in difficulty
[2:13:59] Echo_Esports: Celebrate Echo's latest win in the RWF with the New World First mousepad and loads of other great merch at echogg.ly/merch/Scripe
[2:13:59] tannerazm: It sounds fun. But you want to do X raid, you have to find a group progressing X raid. Seems like it would be hard to find a group to do that and commit to it every week.
[2:14:03] ahri_feet_connoisseur: @callmesval true, correlation dkesnt equal causation
[2:14:10] Honeycrispie: Wouldnt that spread the playerbase quite thin
[2:14:11] noirlol: WoW is a gear Game, not like ffxiv
[2:14:21] s_t_o_r_m__: New content always wins imo
[2:14:26] Oryaki: Extend Chromie Time to end game including all content
[2:14:35] patrikuzis: @noirlol you still need to clear savage for gear
[2:14:47] Artem_V: the best (looking) gear would stlil come from mythic
[2:14:48] patrikuzis: which is more like 7/9-8/9M in difficulty
[2:15:11] ahri_feet_connoisseur: also WeakAuras is a nerf to all old content across the board
[2:15:14] Artem_V: the true endgame
[2:15:20] frexzl: @patrikuzis Yeah but gear in ff14 and wow works way different
[2:15:30] s_t_o_r_m__: swtor has old content that is still hard but after 12 years it gets stale. I rather have new content/operations.
[2:15:34] BipolarPongal: BASED
[2:15:35] stillsuitstk: from quests
[2:15:35] luizog1000: @Scripe why do u want the best from gear
[2:15:40] Thdlock: nah dude the rwf ruined RAIDING
[2:15:43] ZippoIsFreeFromJail: half afk :D
[2:15:44] Santaceso: @ahri_feet_connoisseur True, removing weakauras will make game better
[2:15:46] ewevix: forhead works
[2:15:46] luizog1000: if there is nothing to beat with that gear
[2:15:47] schmuse_drache: have at least a sub. to WoW
[2:15:50] Thdlock: even tho wow mechanics are some of the easiest mmo mechanics
[2:15:52] luizog1000: genuine quest
[2:15:56] Cavox: you just need to buy gold and let people carry you in mythic
[2:15:56] BipolarPongal: Are you saying WoW is harder than Tetris?
[2:15:58] noirlol: TRUE THD
[2:16:03] liberategeorge: forehead on keyboard SeemsGood
[2:16:06] ArroArroArro: Mythic should be bragging rights, achievments and to give players a challange.  Why do people do all sorts of things in all sorts of games, like blindfolded or speed playthroughs. you dont get shit exept bragging rights. Make mythic the same
[2:16:12] sfia: for most people theres more satisfaction the harder you work for the thing though, it's like if you go and give yourself 7million gold in some  single player game you stop playing like a day later lmao
[2:16:12] patrikuzis: @frexzl yes it's simpler but you still have to get gear from savage and/or ultimates to be BiS. You can also just do content in WoW with heroic/M+ vault gear, but you won't reach peak dps
[2:16:17] ahri_feet_connoisseur: is it?
[2:16:26] Hozzar1: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSJM9qF0txw
[2:16:28] Hozzar1: PepeLaugh
[2:16:30] neczotv: sup sir
[2:16:31] stoutside: why did so many people raid in legion?
[2:16:33] maplelost: the scale of 20 ppl makes it way harder
[2:16:33] spyrit14: People in FFXIV are still running Eureaka and Bozja
[2:16:34] s_t_o_r_m__: swtor mechanics is hard, one mistake it's over but it is max 8m
[2:16:35] ewevix: dont stand in fire
[2:16:37] ahri_feet_connoisseur: is wow mechanic more tied to your teammates rather than individual skill?
[2:16:38] Thdlock: i would like
[2:16:44] Thdlock: to see a wow player do this https://youtu.be/Pj_Reo_Cojw?si=3sQNC1-5kAZcXjS9&t=719
[2:16:44] TanknPray: Dont say that outloud people might cancle you
[2:16:49] Thdlock: just listen to the explanation and laugh a little
[2:16:51] patrikuzis: FF14 is a lot more puzzle like while WoW is rapid barrage
[2:16:53] Thdlock: LUL
[2:16:53] Nightbot: LUL
[2:16:57] Hozzar1: just watch it all
[2:17:00] Hozzar1: PepeLaugh
[2:17:05] Aketzali: The main problem with wow is that the mmo genre is slowly dying.
[2:17:05] Echo_Esports: Yooo i yoinked a Staforge PC. Best choice of my life . Go yoink yours at: echogg.ly/starforge/Scripe
[2:17:14] BipolarPongal: he's using his feet
[2:17:17] BipolarPongal: go back
[2:17:18] Eliannoula: the feet
[2:17:19] Honeycrispie: absolute visual clutter on that LA clip christ
[2:17:20] Hozzar1: he played with his feet
[2:17:20] tannerazm: LOOK AT HIS CAM
[2:17:23] luizog1000: @Scripe why do u want the best gear be from mithic if there is nothing for u to beat with that gear, like u alredy beat the boss do u need to beat it harder
[2:17:28] Axki2: blind
[2:17:37] patrikuzis: @luizog1000 yes
[2:17:40] BigMightyena: incontrol Sadge
[2:17:42] BipolarPongal: KEKW
[2:17:45] Eliannoula: stepped on him xD
[2:17:53] holla____: lol
[2:17:54] Artem_V: that's 50% more limbs for 50% more apm
[2:17:57] Hozzar1: that's funny
[2:17:59] Honeycrispie: LMFAO
[2:18:01] spyrit14: Last night in FFXIV we held a memorial for Akira Toriyama
[2:18:06] tannerazm: HE SHOULD HAVE THE BEST LOOT IN WOW
[2:18:08] ahri_feet_connoisseur: why couldn’t he be a hot girl
[2:18:15] Thdlock: SNIFFA
[2:18:27] liberategeorge: FeelsWeirdMan
[2:18:35] Thdlock: check my last msgs to laugh a lil bit
[2:18:36] Thdlock: LUL
[2:18:37] Nightbot: LUL
[2:18:43] Oryaki: He's still playing with the mouse...
[2:19:12] xodo1313: its a game of progression so the gear is used to beat the future content
[2:19:20] TanknPray: Wouldnt that change the race a lot though
[2:19:22] Artem_V: just feeling character progress and feeling more powerful is a pretty strong reward
[2:19:23] stillsuitstk: pro players should practice brojobs more
[2:19:34] maplelost: i think GW2 just made their hardest fight have a 'RWF mode' while nerfing the "mythic" mode for other players
[2:20:05] IAmJoey: that looks so easy lol
[2:20:09] tulumz: lol
[2:20:10] ahri_feet_connoisseur: this looks like lost ark
[2:20:12] ZippoIsFreeFromJail: wtf
[2:20:12] TanknPray: Did they cahnge brel?
[2:20:14] glutenfreetears: peepoTalk
[2:20:19] sfia: yo i wanna do that but i dont wanna play lost ark
[2:20:22] ahri_feet_connoisseur: oh wait it is lost aro
[2:20:29] iamwodan: WAYTOODANK
[2:20:31] BipolarPongal: bro who cooked this boss
[2:20:36] maplelost: how much money do i need to do this fight
[2:20:36] frexzl: PepegaCard lost ark
[2:20:39] TanknPray: Is this still brel?
[2:20:42] liberategeorge: monkaSTEER
[2:20:43] TanknPray: WHoe ver linked this
[2:20:46] luizog1000: this is pis easy is just dodge and go to ur shape
[2:20:46] ahri_feet_connoisseur: Lost Ark raids are insane
[2:20:47] fetza108: bro this seems hard
[2:20:47] Metket: this is not a boss, this is super hexagon game
[2:20:49] Echo_Esports: Time for a break...from your current job? Come work with Echo! Apply at: echogg.ly/apply/Scripe
[2:21:18] ahri_feet_connoisseur: ngl the red indicators on the ground break immersion
[2:21:23] TanknPray: Raiding in lost ark is easier than it looks
[2:21:30] Honeycrispie: if it was good
[2:21:35] ahri_feet_connoisseur: yeah the grind is insanity
[2:21:46] ZippoIsFreeFromJail: and u need 5+ alt chars
[2:21:51] Thdlock: fun fact these raids
[2:21:55] Thdlock: have a very low ilvl requirement
[2:21:56] frexzl: Just speed up the grind with a little swipe Kappa
[2:21:59] Thdlock: and are equalized
[2:22:03] ahri_feet_connoisseur: if you think the grind is bad you have to do it on 5 different alts
[2:22:09] Thdlock: so nothing matters outside of it besides consumes which they hand out like candy
[2:22:13] Honeycrispie: played 18hrs and smashed alt f4 it was numbingly boring
[2:22:27] ZippoIsFreeFromJail: @ahri_feet_connoisseur is soo much..that make me to hate LA
[2:22:33] ahri_feet_connoisseur: @thdlock so it’s purely skill that gets you though the raid?
[2:22:50] ahri_feet_connoisseur: @zippoisfreefromjail yeah I quit too, total shame because I loved the raids
[2:22:51] Thdlock: @ahri_feet_connoisseur the inferno difficulty for the most part yes
[2:22:59] ahri_feet_connoisseur: @thdlock I see
[2:23:14] Thdlock: this boss took a week to clear
[2:23:21] Thdlock: well its 2 bosses
[2:23:24] maplelost: wow playesr dont play other games they only play wow
[2:23:24] Thdlock: same boss but ye
[2:23:30] frelyah: its a korean company they do not care about you at all
[2:23:38] stillsuitstk: wow player is too busy complaining about wow
[2:23:43] ahri_feet_connoisseur: Tbf a lot of mmo players tried lost Ark then quit after finding out the grind required
[2:23:44] IAmJoey: Thd how are you still awake, isnt it like 5 in KKona land?
[2:23:48] ZippoIsFreeFromJail: @stillsuitstk ++++
[2:23:52] Thdlock: @IAmJoey its 6:30 am
[2:23:55] frelyah: it would be amazon contacting you then
[2:23:58] oxiderr: too much grind to play lostark
[2:23:59] frelyah: not the devs
[2:24:00] patrikuzis: isn't it also massively p2w?
[2:24:05] IAmJoey: you just woke up then or still awake?
[2:24:05] Honeycrispie: its early hours for thd monkaTOS
[2:24:11] spyrit14: I knew alot of players who played both wow and FFXIV
[2:24:15] elderkain: Scripe would you say that WoW is the hardest and most complex MMO / game at the highest level?
[2:24:22] ewevix: maby they are just not aware of what the western scene is
[2:24:25] ahri_feet_connoisseur: THD woke up early because he saw scripe start to react to an Asmon video xdd
[2:24:33] ZippoIsFreeFromJail: @spyrit14 like mythic/ultimate raiders
[2:24:38] ZippoIsFreeFromJail: ?
[2:24:39] maplelost: yeah its most complex
[2:24:50] spyrit14: Yeah and casuals
[2:24:55] IAmJoey: its also you have to coordinate 20 players to do mythic
[2:25:08] tannerazm: it's not just about the raid being the hardest. the complexity comes from the prep too I would assume
[2:25:14] IAmJoey: and you have another 8-9 players outside that
[2:25:25] ahri_feet_connoisseur: I mean if you have a dedicated igl whose sole job is to coordinate 20 people for weeks just to clear the raid, it’s pretty damn hard no
[2:25:28] ZippoIsFreeFromJail: @spyrit14 you are a lucky person if u have time for 2 MMORPg :)
[2:25:29] Echo_Esports: Gear up for raid with a world-class sitting experience. Enjoy the same long-lasting comfort as Echo, only with the Secretlab TITAN Evo gaming chair: echogg.ly/secretlab/Scripe
[2:25:31] ewevix: go down to 2?
[2:25:38] Akantorwar: If the remove normal
[2:25:40] Artem_V: i got a mekkatorque mount from LFR, it has its purpose
[2:25:41] Ren26: heroic is way too hard for the wow community already
[2:25:56] maplelost: wow has a story mode?
[2:25:58] ahri_feet_connoisseur: I agree go down to 2
[2:26:00] Akantorwar: agreed
[2:26:07] ahri_feet_connoisseur: L OMEGALUL RE
[2:26:19] brandogzz: LFR needs too be removedd is all i know normal too
[2:26:21] ewevix: it gives some aspirational content aswell
[2:26:26] maplelost: isnt the story mode timegated
[2:26:32] summietje: i think whenever people LFG the RWF those groups also manage to clear first 1-5
[2:26:36] spyrit14: wow has story mode, FFXIV has a trust system
[2:26:41] BipolarPongal: I play it for the trinkets I don't get on normal/heroic
[2:26:44] brandogzz: makes the raid feel less epic when theres 4 difrent modes
[2:26:50] brandogzz: and two of them are free loot
[2:26:51] ZippoIsFreeFromJail: remove lfr..make norma easier and atune heroic :) leave mythic for try hard andys :D
[2:26:51] ahri_feet_connoisseur: I think there’s a certain gravitas with knowing you MADE it to the last boss, think black temple for esample
[2:26:57] resku89: now that Metzen is rehired, the story in WoW will surely be good COPIUM
[2:27:00] noirlol: the modes are totally fine how it is
[2:27:03] maplelost: are we still reacting tothat asmon video or where are we going
[2:27:04] IAmJoey: lfr is funny to do every once in a while. Except for lfr nzoth. I sill have nightmares of half the raid insta getting Mind controlled cuz they didnt have cloak.
[2:27:35] summietje: @Scripe yes mythic bosses 1 upto 5 get done by LFG groups aswell during RWF 2 weeks
[2:28:10] IAmJoey: LFG doing mythic bosses week 1?
[2:28:14] IAmJoey: that is an interesting one
[2:28:28] maplelost: ROFL
[2:28:58] Nastharl: Bliz should decide what % of players they expect to clear a fight and tune for that. If they want .5% then tune for that. If that pisses of noobs, fine. If that means rwf too easy? Fine.
[2:29:05] Honeycrispie: Na certainly doesnt not lfg boss #5 during the first two weeks
[2:29:06] ahri_feet_connoisseur: hot take - make it only one difficulty. RWF can be a speedrun rather than a “challenge”. TBC raiding is a good example
[2:29:13] Honeycrispie: does not*
[2:29:15] TheRatPresident: for me personally the gearing progression is one of the most fun things in the game
[2:29:30] Artem_V: @Nastharl but they do both now? first tune for RWF, then gradually nerf for more %
[2:29:33] noirlol: @ahri_feet_connoisseur bro u dont even play the game
[2:29:51] ahri_feet_connoisseur: @noirlol ?
[2:30:05] maplelost: its the 8man party thats why
[2:30:08] Ren26: the culture is different, in FF people care about practise and learning
[2:30:08] stillsuitstk: improving rewards will also increase clearing %, and vice versa bad rewards will reduce %
[2:30:13] IAmJoey: Personally I think this raid was tuned really nicely. I killed pre nerf tindral and fyrakk as well. it just requires people not doing stupid shit because it will wipe you, which it should imo.
[2:30:20] maplelost: 20 man is its own logistic problem on top of the high skill barrier
[2:30:46] frexzl: @ahri_feet_connoisseur except when we had that system (og naxx, swp) only a small number of players would clear it, so the only difficulty would be mythic in todays standards
[2:31:16] noirlol: 20 is fun but i want both
[2:31:17] Psyquest: 10 man all the way
[2:31:19] ewevix: 10 man is best
[2:31:20] Echo_Esports: Save up to 35% and level up your stream with Elgato! Get started today : echogg.ly/elgato/Scripe
[2:31:20] ahri_feet_connoisseur: @frexzl yeah that’s the biggest downside of it. but it did add gravitas to you clearing the raid
[2:31:21] Honeycrispie: @IAmJoey you killed tindral before every nerf? PogChamp
[2:31:22] brandogzz: @IAmJoey what u mean tuned nicely ?? nerfing tindral 20 times and one of the nerfs was 40% hp bro
[2:31:24] Mandrelll: 10 man
[2:31:25] Ephires: 10 man !
[2:31:25] stillsuitstk: I loved 10 man raiding back in cata / early mop
[2:31:28] shnelmax: 10 man is best
[2:31:29] Joschi174: 20
[2:31:31] tannerazm: I have 20 friends. 20 is cool cause of that. I like 10 man for the competetive aspect.
[2:31:31] Artem_V: 100 man
[2:31:31] maplelost: 40
[2:31:32] frelyah: 10man
[2:31:32] stillsuitstk: 10
[2:31:33] Psyquest: 10
[2:31:33] noirlol: keep both
[2:31:33] KASTAA: 10 and 20

[2:31:39] 4stronauth: it's just not necessary. simple like that. play a DG or play a real raid @Scripe
[2:31:39] Julian_E30: both
[2:31:40] tulumz: Both
[2:31:40] ahri_feet_connoisseur: 20
[2:31:40] ping184: 40 / 25 / 20
[2:31:40] brandogzz: 10
[2:31:41] Lukestylee: Both
[2:31:41] Akantorwar: why not 40 or 5 man
[2:31:41] Metket: 1 i want solo raid
[2:31:42] Aketzali: 10
[2:31:42] Kemskemss: 20
[2:31:43] Meluin: BOTH
[2:31:44] rankonepriest6969: 10
[2:31:44] Honeycrispie: 10 / 20
[2:31:44] Takeido: 20 man requirement is what prevents our group from going higher. skill would be there but we are just 12 friends and so we cant do it.
[2:31:47] IAmJoey: 20 man if they dont fix raid buffs. 10 man if they do
[2:31:48] BJCK: 10
[2:31:48] surprise_body_cavity_exam: 10 easier to organize
[2:31:50] Akantorwar: where is the line?
[2:31:50] Hozzar1: 10
[2:31:58] brandogzz: 10 MAN is so much better
[2:31:59] ahri_feet_connoisseur: the more the better for me
[2:32:01] sfia: the very few 20 mans i have done was cool simply because of how much extra stuff you can do when you have that many opportunities to be creative
[2:32:03] Kemskemss: flexible is great, but unachievable for mythic :c
[2:32:04] n4trixtv: its easier to get 10 good man to play raid
[2:32:08] elirank9: Echo don't have roster and time issues
[2:32:13] sfia: 10 man = less unique utility to use
[2:32:20] AniPsy: both 10/20 are ok, 40 is just for boomers who wants to be carried
[2:32:20] Aketzali: The reason for nerfing bosses used to be that Blizzard wanted people to see the content.
[2:32:21] noirlol: only 10 if you have both
[2:32:27] Exsik: 10man is worse as guildmaster/raidleader... cause having a small roaster makes it horrible to deal with inconsistencies.
[2:32:27] Jelky55: 10man and bring back scroll buffs to make roster more flexible
[2:32:31] Nastharl: @scripe sure, im just saying set a clear expectation "we want the fight to be THIS hard and stick to that.
[2:32:32] lillwerpan: 10 man with 39 specs monkas
[2:32:37] frelyah: @sfia its not about that tho, its about the people
[2:32:38] ZippoIsFreeFromJail: @sfia will be so hard to find a spot in 10m...if dont play meta class
[2:32:39] Frehnx: You love raiding because you can bring up 20 ppl but most of us can't make it every week
[2:32:44] frelyah: getting 20 people is way harder than 10
[2:32:54] ahri_feet_connoisseur: 10 man means one person doing badly brings the whole group down
[2:32:55] Akantorwar: somewhere is the sweetspot
[2:33:12] enigmasvea: yes
[2:33:19] maplelost: so hard raids is not the problem but hard to make 20 man groups
[2:33:21] Kemskemss: @frelyah and other way around. if you have 20 ppl, it’s harder to make 2 teams for 10 (cause u need more tanks for example)
[2:33:28] IAmJoey: I just wish they changed how raid buffs worked. It feels really bad being forced into have 16 raid spots
[2:33:29] brandogzz: THE 20 man mythic raid size kills mythic, 10 man makes it way more attractive
[2:33:40] Jelky55: @Scripe what do u think about flexible mythic raid? 10-30 people like in nm/hc ?
[2:33:43] brandogzz: finding 20 good players is impossible
[2:33:48] ahri_feet_connoisseur: imagine recruiting <Echo> from trade chat
[2:33:52] Honeycrispie: LUL
[2:33:52] Nightbot: LUL
[2:33:54] frelyah: @Kemskemss i doubt not alot of friend groups have a whole 20 people
[2:33:54] tannerazm: @Scripe Play the video LMAO <3
[2:34:02] Artem_V: that guy's name? Meeres
[2:34:28] Echo_Esports: Want to learn from the best? Visit echogg.ly/coaching/Scripe and pick the Echo player that suits your needs!
[2:34:32] IAmJoey: tuning is weird. 30 man heroic can be 30% harder than 20 man heroic
[2:34:34] Kemskemss: @frelyah probably, ye. it’s the first season we got 20 ppl team in my guild and I’m excited (and egoistic in that way) xd
[2:34:36] noirlol: @brandogzz no it does not kill mythic. having 10man and 20man would be perfect but i can imagine its hard to do
[2:34:37] kushlul: !beardchallenge !moustaschemars
[2:35:14] maplelost: i think ppl prefer gear nerfing the content

[2:35:20] Ironhide433: @Scripe Would it be better moneywise to have a 10 man guild? For each player?
[2:35:23] BipolarPongal: !baldchallenge
[2:35:26] ahri_feet_connoisseur: @maplelost good point
[2:35:29] kushlul: i will own echo first match today!

[2:35:43] yenny__: @kushlul dont forget to snort your redbull sir
[2:35:44] IAmJoey: I just wish they changed how raid buffs worked. It feels really bad being forced into have 16 raid spots. @Scripe
[2:35:47] ewevix: 10 mans is best to play with the boys

[2:36:09] Akantorwar: prob the best
[2:36:18] brandogzz: 20 is too many people too manage were it feels like a job
[2:36:18] maplelost: Echo vs Echo Team Scripe vs Team Roger
[2:36:20] ArroArroArro: you are so competitive, you´d have 2 teams and try get top 1 and 2 @Scripe
[2:36:22] ewevix: mass layoffs in echo xD
[2:36:23] Exsik: middle ground, go 15man? ..
[2:36:25] Oryaki: The only reason WoW still exists is because of casuals... if the the subs didn't exist the sponsorship wouldn't be there
[2:36:29] yenny__: surely you would run 2 10 mans Clueless world first and second
[2:36:37] BipolarPongal: CAUGHT

[2:37:34] noirlol: @jelky55 no thanks
[2:37:41] ahri_feet_connoisseur: asmon didn’t react to Max either
[2:38:05] Metket: 13 classes is too much for 10 man
[2:38:12] Honeycrispie: why white ? Kappa
[2:38:14] ahri_feet_connoisseur: he said he respects different opinions and people can have their own opinions yeah
[2:38:23] Oryaki: This will get to a stage were Scripe will react to Max reacting to Asmon reacting to Scripe....
[2:38:28] Echo_Esports: Grab your fantastic new Displates for up to 33% off! Use echogg.ly/displate/Scripe and enter code: ECHO
[2:38:34] BipolarPongal: It's like getting a certificate or medal for participating
[2:38:38] Kemskemss: @ahri_feet_connoisseur sure, and then he’s banning ppl in his chat xd
[2:38:45] noirlol: ye, 10man only works if 20man is available. only 10man is bad
[2:39:14] ahri_feet_connoisseur: @kemskemss if you debate him respectfully he usually doesn’t ban
[2:39:33] frexzl: If Asmon would react to people who still play the game and has to react to his opinion being challenged he would very quickly fold
[2:39:57] BipolarPongal: pre-watched

[2:42:53] Dandinga: exactly, he legit plays wow for 1 week, get all loot and achievements and leaves
[2:42:57] Oryaki: He said earlier bosses should never be nerfed...
[2:42:58] Aketzali: true
[2:43:01] Artem_V: they should have bosses designed for streamers with 1000+ chatters
[2:43:02] Echo_Esports: Celebrate Echo's latest win in the RWF with the New World First mousepad and loads of other great merch at echogg.ly/merch/Scripe

[2:44:42] BipolarPongal: CAUGHT
[2:44:43] Thdlock: WHAT
[2:44:54] ahri_feet_connoisseur: remove macros from wow xdd
[2:45:02] Thdlock: yes but u woul dneed like 5 macros
[2:45:04] Thdlock: KEKW
[2:45:21] holla____: caught
[2:45:55] Thdlock: tbf tho
[2:46:04] Thdlock: even if every boss had 5 diff symbols / color
[2:46:12] Thdlock: it would be very hard to orient ur brain for each fight
[2:46:20] Thdlock: to press a macro for a specific action
[2:46:23] fetza108: @NymannTV he high end raid too and played every aspect of the game. i just wanted to say i think he has experience to talk about this and he can be righ in a lot of things.
[2:46:27] Thdlock: that is diff across each fight
[2:46:35] tow996: they should just make coding challenges instead of raids, and whoever makes most optimal WA wins the race YEP
[2:46:51] Thdlock: well ye
[2:46:57] Thdlock: there shouldnt be a ptr or a journal
[2:47:02] Thdlock: the journal actually makes 0 sense
[2:47:04] ahri_feet_connoisseur: imagine a weakauras competition
[2:47:07] Thdlock: cuz dumbass players dont even read it anyway
[2:47:33] BipolarPongal: @kushlul Good luck tonight. Take out Mandatory thnx o7
[2:47:40] Taco_Namaco: the journal yaps too much

[2:48:02] Taco_Namaco: too many words!
[2:48:27] Chaewon5: ok
[2:48:47] Thdlock: wait so your telling me it would be a surprise to not know boss order at all
[2:48:50] ahri_feet_connoisseur: that would be insanely cool as a biewer
[2:48:50] Thdlock: and just walk up to smolderon
[2:48:54] Thdlock: and see fyrakk flying above him
[2:48:55] TheRatPresident: really wish the entire raid was like that
[2:49:00] Thdlock: and wonder if fyrakk is gonna do anything during the fight
[2:49:03] Echo_Esports: Yooo i yoinked a Staforge PC. Best choice of my life . Go yoink yours at: echogg.ly/starforge/Scripe
[2:49:03] brandogzz: yes agree

[2:49:06] sfia: if addons and journal/ptr were removed how many people would blind prog?
[2:49:12] Thdlock: where smodleron says to fyrakk to do something
[2:49:15] Thdlock: but fyrakk says lol no
[2:49:23] tow996: lost ark does it well, no PTR, no journal just send it, and its alot easier to do raids if u know mechs, but 1st teams suffer
[2:49:29] EppatTV: @sfia only world first guilds
[2:49:32] Chaewon5: ok
[2:49:35] yenny__: @sfia probably not too many since culture change takes a pretty long time

[2:55:14] Akantorwar: besides the damage number you see in game
[2:55:14] ahri_feet_connoisseur: They can add dps meters back on as an official implementationthough

[2:57:40] Akantorwar: the more information you have the more do you need to perform best

[3:00:02] Dandinga: 9/9 lfr EZ
[3:00:03] s_t_o_r_m__: LFR LUL
[3:00:05] liberategeorge: if you get carried it's doable
[3:00:06] nophayaya: or a turbo grieffer that got carried
[3:00:10] ZippoIsFreeFromJail: asmon chatters arent mythic raiders
[3:00:18] Honeycrispie: Just like the guy earlier saying he LFG'd the 5th boss week1 of amidrassil KEKW
[3:00:28] spyrit14: wow is designed with addons in mind. Blizzard would have to change alot to delete addons
[3:00:30] jamauricius: blizzard is not making addons, players are. if addons were bad they would not exist in the 1st place
[3:00:30] ahri_feet_connoisseur: @zippoisfreefromjail dorki is a regular in Asmon chat
[3:00:32] holla____: xddcat > xdd
[3:00:33] Honeycrispie: on mythic* ofc
[3:00:33] BlindOwlInTree: he did 9/9 mythic it just cost him few mill gold :D
[3:00:43] Honeycrispie: some people just love to lie in chat for 0 reason KEKW
[3:00:47] nophayaya: @jamauricius BASED
[3:01:02] ZippoIsFreeFromJail: @ahri_feet_connoisseur you know every rule.. :)
[3:01:11] spyrit14: IN FFXIV if you're caught with addons you get your account deleted
[3:01:20] stillsuitstk: sayuwuYikes sayuwuYikes sayuwuYikes sayuwuYikes sayuwuYikes sayuwuYikes
[3:01:23] Hozzar1: @spyrit14 they can't detect it
[3:01:32] Hozzar1: also they have no anti-cheat
[3:01:45] FireFireFireFireFireFire: imagine they do this and delete all addons and we just have to put our faith in blizzard Despairge
[3:01:46] Chaewon5: "rio and parsing should be banned"
[3:01:48] Chaewon5: thats insane
[3:01:58] suupaaah: Can't they just change the API s o addons cant track anything
[3:01:59] spyrit14: That's not the point some people do get caught and get their accounts deleted
[3:02:08] Hozzar1: @spyrit14 they really don't care
[3:02:12] Chaewon5: @FireFireFireFireFireFire yea noty. no one has ever been happy with blizzard deliverance
[3:02:14] Kemskemss: @NymannTV what does allthethings do?
[3:02:32] spyrit14: Yes they do. Yoshi-P is quite firm on that.
[3:02:34] Hozzar1: if they did they'd've dealt with it ages,
[3:02:35] s_t_o_r_m__: @Chaewon5 wth is rio?
[3:02:40] Demmou: @suupaaah No. Either the API provides information or it doesn't. An API can't say: "You can't store this variable somewhere else"
[3:02:44] Chaewon5: @s_t_o_r_m__ raider io
[3:02:49] s_t_o_r_m__: ah ty
[3:03:06] Hozzar1: @spyrit14 why doesn't ff14 have an anti-cheat, also other japanese games have anti-cheat what's ff14 excuse?
[3:03:10] suupaaah: @Demmou If it doesnt provide information wouldnt that mean no addons would work?
[3:03:12] tannerazm: @Kemskemss Tracks all items in the game. Basically a progress bar to see how many items you are missing.
[3:03:13] ZippoIsFreeFromJail: @Kemskemss wierd addon for ppl with a lot of free time :D
[3:03:19] liberategeorge: SCATTER
[3:03:24] Demmou: @suupaaah Pretty much, yeah.
[3:03:25] Kemskemss: omg :D
[3:03:39] spyrit14: You can watch Yoshi P on several videos about addons
[3:03:39] Hozzar1: yeah
[3:03:41] stillsuitstk: @Hozzar1 anti cheat is not an ultimate solution, I am saying it as a cheater
[3:03:48] Santaceso: Addons in WoW is like mods in other games: it makes game better for you taste and adds QOL, but are they fair in mmo? In games with mods and multiplayer, the server says the players need this addon to play, everyone is equal
[3:04:00] Hozzar1: @stillsuitstk i know
[3:04:10] spyrit14: You get caught with addons in FFXIV you get your account removed.
[3:04:17] Hozzar1: but saying they care is abit of a lie
[3:04:26] Artem_V: Patricia strongly condemns cheating
[3:04:32] Eliannoula: in ff they don't detect if you're using addons but if you get reported with proof then they act on it
[3:04:35] Thdlock: there is a real easy way to not get caught with addons in ff tho
[3:04:35] TetrixEffect: problem is FF runs on playstation too so they can never all be equal
[3:04:40] Thdlock: its called just dont record ur computer
[3:04:41] Thdlock: lmao gg easy
[3:04:43] BipolarPongal: describe taste OpieOP
[3:04:45] Thdlock: xddcat
[3:04:54] Hozzar1: @Thdlock That's what i'm saying
[3:04:54] FireFireFireFireFireFire: at this point, aren't addons integrated in wow's dna?
[3:04:59] yenny__: i am Clueless
[3:05:00] yenny__: trust
[3:05:10] BipolarPongal: Addons don't make me Thd. Still hardstuck in world 400
[3:05:17] Eliannoula: @TetrixEffect you actually can have addons on ps5
[3:05:20] kingsize1g: bro is this manti ?
[3:05:25] spyrit14: both xbox and playstation players cannot use addons, it puts pc players at an advantage
[3:05:27] stillsuitstk: yes
[3:05:28] Thdlock: i think teh funniest part is
[3:05:32] Julian_E30: you can use them too or make your own WA ?
[3:05:37] Thdlock: in farm like 2 weeks ago
[3:05:42] Thdlock: my weakauras broke completley
[3:05:47] Thdlock: and i didnt realize it on fyrakk
[3:05:56] Thdlock: till i wasnt assinged on the private aura intermission mech
[3:06:03] Thdlock: but i found my spot anyway KEKW
[3:06:07] spyrit14: Wow is designed with addons in mind that is the difference
[3:06:09] Julian_E30: sure are the people in the rwf better then the average player wtf
[3:06:15] yenny__: only WA i use this tier is smoldy bombs and fyrak assignments for soak/jails
[3:06:17] yenny__: Chatting
[3:06:18] Eliannoula: @spyrit14 it didn't
[3:06:21] BipolarPongal: ????
[3:06:23] Echo_Esports: Grab your fantastic new Displates for up to 33% off! Use echogg.ly/displate/Scripe and enter code: ECHO
[3:06:27] EppatTV: ????
[3:06:27] BipolarPongal: bro what is he smoking
[3:06:28] ZippoIsFreeFromJail: :D
[3:06:35] Dellin: then he wont get legendaries
[3:06:36] Dandinga: he says one thing and then another
[3:06:38] maplelost: i want what hes smoking
[3:06:40] showmethekappa: make legendary cost gold cap from a vendor Kappa
[3:06:44] ZippoIsFreeFromJail: Kappa
[3:06:53] EppatTV: People don't play the game only to raid lol
[3:06:59] FireFireFireFireFireFire: but why wouldn't you have it
[3:07:04] marsagoxd: idk why even listen to asmonglold, he doesnt even  play the game anymore
[3:07:04] maplelost: quit the foreplay: just put it on wow store
[3:07:10] FireFireFireFireFireFire: like the cloak was easy to get
[3:07:13] Eliannoula: @Eliannoula but they allowed it which started the arms race cause they opened pandoras box
[3:07:16] spyrit14: At this point wow would have to change the game alot to delete addons
[3:07:17] Thdlock: alright its getting late guys
[3:07:20] Thdlock: its 7:30 am
[3:07:22] Thdlock: im going to bed
[3:07:25] Thdlock: xddcat
[3:07:26] yenny__: eep well
[3:07:43] Kemskemss: @Thdlock have a good sleep, sir
[3:07:45] fetza108: @Thdlock lol wtf :D
[3:08:10] Artem_V: you don't need a reason to be mad
[3:08:12] Artem_V: just be mad
[3:08:14] FireFireFireFireFireFire: this way most of the playerbase will never see a legendary
[3:08:17] BipolarPongal: Bedge
[3:08:19] noobalhao: good "night"
[3:08:20] spyrit14: it is weird that Microsoft made a deal with SE to play FFXIV on xbox, yet wow cannot be played on xbox
[3:08:21] kingsize1g: hahahahha
[3:08:21] ZippoIsFreeFromJail: yeah :X u look very mad :D
[3:08:25] Thdlock: heard that one
[3:08:27] EppatTV: KEKW
[3:08:29] Thdlock: but also u realize
[3:08:34] fetza108: Bedge
[3:08:35] Thdlock: i sleep 4-5 hrs at the event anyway
[3:08:37] Aketzali: I am still waiting for my BIS legendary from Legion to drop.
[3:08:41] Thdlock: and do my lost ark dailies in the morning right
[3:08:53] Dandinga: the fuck is the game he plays in the background? a gacha game?
[3:08:55] Thdlock: because wow took my wquests
[3:08:57] FireFireFireFireFireFire: and blizzard has data on this, if ppl have almost no chance of getting the best item in the game they lose interest faster
[3:09:10] tizliminator: He says you need to get legendaries, when they don't matter anymore, so it doesn't feel as bad playing without it
[3:09:41] fetza108: asmon memories in wow is just insane though
[3:09:51] ewevix: ye all legendaries in the last tier after last boss, so they can have high power
[3:10:01] Hozzar1: ngl the post is lit as fuck
[3:10:19] stillsuitstk: TL;DR: Wow players LOVE to complain
[3:10:26] Artem_V: this is the best post because i agree with it
[3:10:29] spyrit14: FFXIV has well developed casual content, so much so that people don't feel pressured to have to do the hardest content
[3:10:32] s_t_o_r_m__: not only wow players LUL
[3:10:47] ZippoIsFreeFromJail: he said he will not read the whole thing from the begging
[3:10:51] noirlol: DELUSIONAL ICANT
[3:10:58] Echo_Esports: Celebrate Echo's latest win in the RWF with the New World First mousepad and loads of other great merch at echogg.ly/merch/Scripe
[3:11:05] thewozardofiz: I would remove the fun
[3:11:13] VerityNS: Does he want to kill wow?
[3:11:17] Artem_V: vote asmongold 2024
[3:11:19] ewevix: he wants classic basically
[3:11:19] Sapyu1: ngl i would not play wow with standard ui
[3:11:25] ZippoIsFreeFromJail: if ur casual just leave the game :D
[3:11:30] spyrit14: Blizzard knows that casual are alot of players, but don't develop casual content
[3:11:37] stillsuitstk: ICANT
[3:11:40] Hozzar1: apart from the that
[3:11:45] EppatTV: Why we still care what this person thinks about a game he no longer plays lol
[3:11:48] kredorilwow: but are the raids actually that hard/
[3:11:51] FireFireFireFireFireFire: it's a shame cause some of the most fun bosses in my experience are almost not doable without weakauras
[3:11:51] Vertigo_GB: 40 man suck
[3:11:52] Artem_V: not getting elected with that platform
[3:12:06] maplelost: he doesnt acknowledge mmo pvp
[3:12:06] yaugerz: it is yes
[3:12:08] Demmou: Everyone wins RainbowPoggers
[3:12:10] ZippoIsFreeFromJail: yeah
[3:12:19] rockxtv: I think the balance part. like sod pvp is competitive but not balanced. retail the opposite
[3:12:23] Kemskemss: just friendly hug each other to death?
[3:12:29] Stinkefedt: I dunno, have fun.
[3:12:34] stillsuitstk: @Artem_V look at his chat, 100% agree, he know his audience
[3:12:43] stillsuitstk: cause eveyone else is banned
[3:12:55] thewozardofiz: I started last year, no problem
[3:12:57] yenny__: retail wow is not that hard to get into tbh
[3:12:57] thewozardofiz: he has no idea
[3:12:59] Demmou: Honestly. Even a 25 man raid on an okay-ish PC todays day and age wrecks the FPS to below 30 at times
[3:13:07] yenny__: if you care about pve you only need to learn M+ and raid
[3:13:10] maplelost: he removing so many things its changing it int oa different game
[3:13:10] yenny__: Chatting
[3:13:17] EppatTV: Here come the flex xddcat
[3:13:19] fetza108: but there are difficulties, right? i can play lfr or normal raiding. thats it. i dont have to raid in mythic difficulty if i dont want to.
[3:13:21] jamauricius: it's actually harder to get into classic/sod than retail for a new player
[3:13:21] noirlol: he does not play the game, last time he played was 8years ago in legion when he "liked" he game but back then it almost he same as right now ICANT guy is delusional, should move on
[3:13:35] AniPsy: xdd boomer flexing
[3:13:36] maplelost: BIG PUMPA
[3:13:44] noirlol: YE BUT WHATS DIFFERENT RIGHT NOW ICANT
[3:13:48] Hozzar1: he's got the best parse on nighthold?
[3:13:56] Hozzar1: star aurger?
[3:13:59] EppatTV: The game is literally the same since legion lol
[3:14:11] thewozardofiz: staying alive is everything
[3:14:12] fetza108: @fetza108 this is why i dont get these conversation. you have a choice in game what difficulty you wanna play...
[3:14:23] stillsuitstk: GET RID OF FILTHY rfwf RAIDERS
[3:14:28] ewevix: check deathlogs
[3:14:28] Vertigo_GB: DPS meter is good for self improvement
[3:14:40] yenny__: i dont care about parses but dps meter + logs is just too important for self improvement
[3:14:41] noirlol: @EppatTV he has problems, thats for sure, kinda wild and his NPC sheep chat agrees randomly without thinking
[3:14:45] liberategeorge: Sadge i like raiding
[3:14:49] Avarizz: i dont even understand how u can have these takes when u dont even play the game... its so sad.
[3:14:49] Demmou: DPS meter does allow for abuse though aswell.
[3:14:50] noobalhao: raiding in ff14 without a dps meter is super boring too
[3:14:50] noirlol: raiding > all
[3:15:00] Julian_E30: DPS meters are important to find the people who you want to play with
[3:15:01] im_kameo: it is not fun imo
[3:15:07] Gorthol217: just make echo a final fantasy guild so wow can be good Kappa
[3:15:07] im_kameo: atm
[3:15:09] testopala: who won mdi???
[3:15:10] FireFireFireFireFireFire: these are the same issues since the start of the game
[3:15:21] ryan4: raiding is most fun for me, if it wasnt in the game i prob wouldnt play it
[3:15:26] Sapyu1: prog raiding is the best experience i had in games
[3:15:29] FireFireFireFireFireFire: it's just natural for mmo's to feel jaded after some time
[3:15:34] Hozzar1: that's true
[3:15:40] EppatTV: You literally do on Fyraak and Tindral AHAHAH
[3:15:43] maplelost: i enjoy long walks back to the boss like girls like long walks on beaches
[3:15:43] testopala: WHO WON MDI?!?!?!?
[3:15:47] FireFireFireFireFireFire: people quit, new ppl have a harder time to get in cause they're behind, etc
[3:15:55] Kemskemss: that’s the only thing I can agree on. Tindrall and Fyrakk was great in that regard
[3:15:57] spyrit14: After over 20 years of playing mmos I burned out on raiding
[3:15:59] neugassh: mythic raiding is minuscule
[3:16:11] chubahi: @testopala ei ole ohi viel
[3:16:14] noirlol: ICANT
[3:16:16] maplelost: hes gone too super casual bro
[3:16:25] AniPsy: you lose food buff in ff if you die tho Kapp
[3:16:28] Kemskemss: @testopala finals are tmrw
[3:16:39] Eliannoula: @AniPsy you don't
[3:16:40] fetza108: i think he is true in lots of thing but i think he burned out of wow too
[3:16:45] yenny__: tyrany of the majority kinda stiffles out people over time
[3:16:50] noirlol: @fetza108 he is wrong on 99% of things brother
[3:16:51] Sapyu1: imo less ppl would play his new version of wow than current wow
[3:16:52] Hozzar1: xffingcat
[3:16:54] Hozzar1: this video
[3:16:55] yenny__: makes it prone to kill of niche comunities and slowly die out
[3:16:58] Echo_Esports: Yooo i yoinked a Staforge PC. Best choice of my life . Go yoink yours at: echogg.ly/starforge/Scripe
[3:16:59] s_t_o_r_m__: Raider are the ones that pull the cart not casuals
[3:17:01] noirlol: @noirlol ICANT ICANT ICANT
[3:17:01] stillsuitstk: reactception
[3:17:02] Hozzar1: watch this
[3:17:04] Mallaes: luxthoSus
[3:17:09] liberategeorge: romantic viewing of venruki's stream on valentine's day
[3:17:11] maplelost: venruki seems to always report on some pvp killing issue every month
[3:17:16] TheRatPresident: macro
[3:17:18] FireFireFireFireFireFire: imo the best blizz can do after the playerbase is bored of the content is just say fuck it and have fun with the season Shruge
[3:17:25] spyrit14: I think Yoshi P is mauling over not adding more classes so mcuh so the team can focus on developing the current classes
[3:17:28] fetza108: @noirlol okay so he just burned out and dont talk but he loves to :D
[3:18:00] ewevix: this feels so irrelvant
[3:18:02] TheRatPresident: its a sequence macro
[3:18:05] s_t_o_r_m__: yeah
[3:18:09] EppatTV: it's a simple cursor macro KEKW
[3:18:11] s_t_o_r_m__: nothing special
[3:18:16] maplelost: is it an addon
[3:18:19] Metket: watch @Scripe chanx he faced 10+ bots in arena today
[3:18:35] noirlol: ye bots in arena is so fucked up
[3:18:37] noirlol: pretty sad
[3:18:45] stillsuitstk: target macro?
[3:18:45] maplelost: are the bots better than players
[3:18:54] s_t_o_r_m__: yeah just turn off macro's in pvp all fixed
[3:18:59] noirlol: @maplelost ye they do unhuman things, its disgusting
[3:19:01] Stinkefedt: Probably very intuitive for a new player
[3:19:12] FireFireFireFireFireFire: that's super basic tho
[3:19:15] liberategeorge: seems ok to me
[3:19:33] Kemskemss: isn’t it kinda basic macro? o.O
[3:19:35] L0opito: This macro isn't even over the top lmao just smart
[3:19:46] Honeycrispie: KEKW
[3:19:57] Nikz1_: dude rogues have this kind of basic macros since tbc
[3:20:09] fetza108: GIGACHAD
[3:20:17] Xerpytv: meow
[3:20:18] Gorthol217: BatChest
[3:20:21] Exsik: this is not even new xD.. like wtf
[3:20:22] Charm_pit: its like most basic macro commands
[3:20:22] Ziane: that is just a kinda normal macro no?
[3:20:23] ewevix: i mean thats it, just close down the whole game
[3:20:25] Chernobyl26: a SECOND MACRO?!??!
[3:20:29] Chernobyl26: double illegal
[3:20:36] liberategeorge: how many years old is this video?
[3:20:37] Nikz1_: lmao
[3:20:38] Kemskemss: cursor macro! whoa whoa
[3:20:39] Julian_E30: right to jail
[3:20:51] Pava_TV: what is wrong with those ppl ?
[3:20:55] noirlol: wait for the take.. this is why ARENA is bad guys! remove from the game
[3:21:05] FireFireFireFireFireFire: yeah exactly
[3:21:12] nophayaya: wow content creators Despairge
[3:21:14] Echo_Esports: Time for a break...from your current job? Come work with Echo! Apply at: echogg.ly/apply/Scripe
[3:21:16] Vertigo_GB: really not complicated ...
[3:21:17] ewevix: KEKW
[3:21:34] FireFireFireFireFireFire: how is that a macro issue, @cursor macros are so basic
[3:21:43] maplelost: macros are killing pvp
[3:21:44] EppatTV: ?????
[3:21:46] noirlol: ICANT
[3:21:48] chubahi: ???
[3:21:49] L0opito: cast sequence macros are way more controversial than this
[3:21:50] stillsuitstk: MACRO IS THE REASON????
[3:21:51] Mallaes: :V
[3:21:51] yenny__: its dead NOOOO
[3:21:51] fetza108: KEKW
[3:21:52] Chernobyl26: that single macro killed arena
[3:21:55] liberategeorge: remove macros Kappa
[3:21:56] noirlol: bro is an NPC
[3:22:01] Vertigo_GB: that has nothing to do Addons or anything ...
[3:22:03] Stinkefedt: Think you need to put yourself in the mindset of a normal player
[3:22:07] FireFireFireFireFireFire: can't they have some cd on that ability in arena/pvp instead
[3:22:13] ZippoIsFreeFromJail: Macros arent the problen...but all the CC skills
[3:22:23] Sorgenkind87: its so hard to listen to this guy
[3:22:24] AniPsy: leave balance to these boomers and they turn pvp into turn based chess where brown "war" goes first KEKW
[3:22:37] JRoosy: he is more of an battleground person
[3:22:44] OurCamel: PVP is a mini game to be honest
[3:22:51] noirlol: @JRoosy and? ICANT nothning to do with his NPC takes
[3:22:58] Hozzar1: the video is finished
[3:23:00] Hozzar1: btw
[3:23:03] Avarizz: arena was so much fun back in the days
[3:23:04] neugassh: arena was always very tiny part of wow
[3:23:30] JRoosy: @noirlol im not defending him lmao. im not an asmongold enjoyer. its just how he sees it, and dont want to have to get good enough for arena
[3:23:37] maplelost: I feel so sorry for WoW players having to acknowledge such unhinged opinions
[3:23:54] stillsuitstk: video that costs echo your sponsor
[3:24:13] Metket: #removegladmounts
[3:24:19] Metket: #playatyourrating
[3:24:24] maplelost: blizzard is bad we know dawg
[3:24:28] Xerpytv: asmon takes ResidentSleeper
[3:24:32] fetza108: KEKW  󠀀
[3:24:44] fetza108: we got asmonbrain
[3:24:45] Stinth: asmon and his chat complaining to complain BASED
[3:24:47] fetza108: now
[3:24:48] fetza108: :D
[3:24:56] BagamaTwitchTV: apparently its not fun to play NOT at the top, but if you are not good enough to be there you need to complain LUL
[3:24:59] Eliannoula: POG
[3:25:13] jamauricius: so the recipe for the perfect wow expansion is: no addons, no macros, no arenas, 1 mechanic bosses and ez gear
[3:25:16] Hozzar1: Sure
[3:25:17] fetza108: asmon in these days like a gamer philosopher KEKW
[3:25:18] maplelost: starforge pcs ruined wow raiding
[3:25:20] motinhagmr: People are just envious theyy suck alot more than world first raiders and they need to get validation from videos like this. if they banned WF race they would be so happy! but the game would still suck at their eyes.
[3:25:29] noirlol: ICANT
[3:25:30] Echo_Esports: Gear up for raid with a world-class sitting experience. Enjoy the same long-lasting comfort as Echo, only with the Secretlab TITAN Evo gaming chair: echogg.ly/secretlab/Scripe
[3:25:32] JRoosy: since he has/had collection mania, the only reason he wanted to play arena was to ge the glad mount
[3:25:42] Aketzali: Just play another game
[3:26:05] noirlol: hes stuck in 2007, cant let go
[3:26:08] Metket: @Scripe because he stopped playing the game he got carried to glad couple times in shadowlands to get those mounts so he complains now
[3:26:11] Exsik: the sad thing about asmon, is that the few good things he says is completely lost in horrible takes, no concept of how stuff actually works and he wants a diferent game than warcraft but doesn't know how to quit
[3:26:25] Demmou: I would love to do RWF raiding. But I simply can't spend the time required to do so
[3:26:29] JRoosy: @Metket did that from legion to shadowlands season 1 KEKL
[3:26:42] OurCamel: Addons is the cancer of complexity, remove addons and the game gets like 60% more simpler
[3:26:45] FireFireFireFireFireFire: for a while you could just have your reticle based spells cast directly under your focus target, but they changed that right?
[3:26:47] maplelost: im not bad the game is bad
[3:27:04] motinhagmr: @Demmou time is not the same as skill or natural talent. thats the difference beetween cutting edge.
[3:27:07] fetza108: found in retail a very casual gameplay because i have not so much time for it and that is great and not even close to that asmon converstation. i found my way to enjoy the game
[3:27:09] LuiBMHunter: no cata beta?
[3:27:14] Bjorne: @maplelost the both can be true my guy
[3:27:16] D347Hzor: Time to show us how fun and not dead arenas are
[3:27:42] JRoosy: filtered by alex savage classic
[3:27:43] jamauricius: but the game is already made in a way that you can enjoy it at a basic level without stressing too much on addons and macros. there's different raid and dungeon difficulties for that reason
[3:27:46] Demmou: @motinhagmr I have multiple CEs
[3:27:47] tvilk: no, please, no more world of warcraft
[3:27:50] frexzl: Play cata beta mr scripe
[3:27:53] heaskdj: yesn't
[3:27:55] Jack_the_Dipper: Yeah sure why not levle it now
[3:27:58] Stinth: if you just spam takes some will get clipped and pop off Gladge
[3:27:58] fetza108: @Scripe cata beta bro
[3:27:59] suupaaah: cata beta
[3:28:00] maplelost: SoD lets go
[3:28:06] Honeycrispie: cata bita
[3:28:08] D347Hzor: Solo shuffle arenas
[3:28:17] FireFireFireFireFireFire: @jamauricius yeah exactly, i think it's just coming to terms that he can't have it all at the highest level anymore
[3:28:18] wTFologie: Baradin Hold
[3:28:19] maplelost: cata classic? is that still classic
[3:28:19] JRoosy: go do blind progging TEA Okayge
[3:28:19] tvilk: Baradin Hold
[3:28:20] Demmou: Cata warlock soooo good!
[3:28:20] ovoox: Cata raids were really good
[3:28:21] Them3y3s: brutalus
[3:28:22] yenny__: hop on tekken
[3:28:27] ovoox: apart from last 2 bosses in Dragon Soul
[3:28:33] frexzl: @maplelost ofc it is
[3:28:44] Them3y3s: nvm its not brutalus thats sunwel
[3:28:47] fetza108: i will drop sod for cata when comes out definitely. i love rated battlegrounds in cata
[3:28:49] tvilk: I might give cata classic raiding a go
[3:29:04] D347Hzor: Time to level on classic wotlk to be ready for cata
[3:29:14] fetza108: @tvilk yes im thinking about this too
[3:29:21] LuiBMHunter: you haven't upgraded to TWW yet?
[3:29:29] FireFireFireFireFireFire: like if you want there to a niche for exceptional players then you gotta accept that you can't "complete" the game as a normal player, not at nearly the same pace anyway
[3:29:33] tvilk: in 2 months
[3:29:43] maplelost: when dawntrail releases
[3:29:44] Echo_Esports: Save up to 35% and level up your stream with Elgato! Get started today : echogg.ly/elgato/Scripe
[3:29:46] JRoosy: it was fine until the trinkets from Dragon souls came out
[3:30:13] tvilk: That sword from Dragon Soul being bis for all 2h classes in PvP because of the tentacles omega melting PepeLaugh
[3:30:15] D347Hzor: Goblin shamans and shadowpriest so good
[3:30:15] ovoox: Never played classic, but do they fix the raids for release? I.e. Al Akir nerf/Atramedes outside the room stuff?
[3:30:18] LuiBMHunter: The war within
[3:30:31] fetza108: @Scripe my favourite raiding video about cata. "Dream Paragon VS Spine of Deathwing 25HC" https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpBYiJzt2AI
[3:30:37] yorkyboi2008: any keys today?
[3:30:59] Honeycrispie: @ovoox shorter cadence with changes yes
[3:31:08] tvilk: YEP
[3:31:08] riotscream: been trying to get ppl to come back for years the way in witch mythic is difficult is biggest reason . when 1 players error wipes a raid there is no fun to be had. can scripe see a fix to this?
[3:31:10] EppatTV: lfg KEKW
[3:31:17] yenny__: M+ fatigue from queue sim is real
[3:31:19] yenny__: if you do it solo
[3:31:25] D347Hzor: Do viewer keys
[3:31:38] Arkismall: Some of the echo boys must be up for high keys after the mdi weekend.
[3:31:41] ovoox: @Honeycrispie ah cool so they release the bosses in a sort of 'fixed' state, because so many of those bosses were broken ha ha. Remember kiting magmaw adds around the whole raid
[3:32:05] yorkyboi2008: @scripe if u want groups i will soon be high enough to join
[3:32:12] Honeycrispie: @ovoox yea if theres a prenerf version the community wants to fight they'll leave it that way for a bit and then nerf it for the "casual" side of the community if u wanna call it that.
[3:32:16] yorkyboi2008: if u play with us
[3:32:29] Honeycrispie: @ovoox but if you're talking straight up broken fights thats fixed from the getgo.
[3:32:51] ovoox: @Honeycrispie nice, yeah remember the paragon vid with half the raid sat afk for p1 al akir ha ha
[3:33:01] tvilk: It's the thing I really don't like about FFXIV raiding.. You can die and people ress you and sure you do 50% less damage or whatever, but you're only close to hitting enrage if 3-4 people die and get ressed
[3:33:02] stillsuitstk: isnt keys are pushed already to the max? just wait new season
[3:33:02] yenny__: queue simulator fatigue awaree
[3:33:13] FireFireFireFireFireFire: what makes them frustrated is the fomo involved with the rewards you can get from mythic raiding
[3:33:57] yenny__: night elf
[3:34:15] FireFireFireFireFireFire: maybe if blizzard just deletes the fomo, have people focus on the present and enjoy it without worrying that they'll miss out on shit if they take a break for a month or 2 Shruge
[3:35:07] Honeycrispie: 3694 cutoff
[3:35:09] Kemskemss: @FireFireFireFireFireFire awesome take ngl
[3:35:11] FireFireFireFireFireFire: ye but ppl like asmon are massive completionists
[3:35:24] Honeycrispie: KEKW
[3:35:25] FireFireFireFireFireFire: and many mmo players are i think LULW
[3:35:36] elsnickito: @Scripe Hi, sorry for spamming this question, have you checked out the gw2 rwf?
[3:35:40] stillsuitstk: Giga payer
[3:35:50] FireFireFireFireFireFire: or maybe completionist is the wrong word, collector
[3:35:51] dante7867: hey! Is Meteor prio to use during skb/combo or is it generally better to work on skb charges?
[3:35:56] LuiBMHunter: space hopper?
[3:36:02] stillsuitstk: p2w
[3:36:15] liberategeorge: find a stick and play with that
[3:36:34] Jack_the_Dipper: Seeing that person in a city with a few epics or even the Thunderfurry. That made me want to progress back in the days
[3:36:35] dante7867: cheers!
[3:36:35] Echo_Esports: Want to learn from the best? Visit echogg.ly/coaching/Scripe and pick the Echo player that suits your needs!
[3:36:36] LuiBMHunter: you need to repair ...
[3:36:41] tvilk: or just find some good tank who can boost you to 3600 KEKW
[3:37:29] kingsize1g: bfa
[3:37:55] stillsuitstk: they are cooking
[3:38:02] FireFireFireFireFireFire: @Kemskemss ty peepoKissies
[3:38:03] LuiBMHunter: can you remember the last time you worried about repair costs?
[3:38:13] mohaso21: @tvilk do you mean me PepeLaugh
[3:38:20] tvilk: @mohaso21, PepeLaugh
[3:38:34] Mallaes: Night Elf I believe
[3:38:37] LuiBMHunter: @mohaso21 he said good tank!
[3:38:44] Xerpytv: queue simulator Bedge
[3:38:49] tvilk: @LuiBMHunter, BANNED
[3:38:53] LuiBMHunter: eek!
[3:38:56] EppatTV: yeah, night elf
[3:39:09] mohaso21: tvilk if only he knows
[3:39:27] Hozzar1: holy shit your bags are bad
[3:39:28] stillsuitstk: my friend was looking how I play wow (classic but same thing for him anyway) and he said it is a waiting simulator
[3:39:30] Ironhide433: 5Head
[3:39:32] Stinth: do the rep grind bro Weirdge
[3:39:35] Stinth: like the rest of us
[3:39:48] Stinth: (it is free for us casuals)
[3:39:53] tvilk: @stillsuitstk, classic is the biggest waiting simulator of all the wow games
[3:40:14] Stinth: timegated, but very little effort weekly
[3:40:17] baltazzor: i thought they removed fortified raging combo on live keys cus tanks got 1 shot
[3:40:24] Hozzar1: casual KEKW
[3:40:28] ryan4: tbf at this point anything that's not bolstering is push week
[3:40:41] KiwiGuy17: Couple weeks :P
[3:40:54] hisk58: SA
[3:40:54] yorkyboi2008: what other classes do you like playing?
[3:41:04] Stinth: 5 weeks minimal effort ish
[3:41:27] LuiBMHunter: Ret pally is the most fun for me in m+
[3:41:29] tvilk: ofc you play rogue
[3:41:33] tvilk: stun stun stun stun stun stun vanish
[3:41:43] tvilk: rat gameplay
[3:41:55] nishayaa: i have tried frost mage for the first time in my life and it is so much fun!
[3:42:02] Stinth: I learned a lot from playing one @Scripe
[3:42:13] Stinth: I think it's worth to play it yourself
[3:42:20] stillsuitstk: SMOrc  alliance SMOrc
[3:42:22] tvilk: FLASHBANG

[3:44:36] tvilk: Did you hear about them potentially adding Retail lore into SOD? With Xalatath and shit?
[3:44:39] stillsuitstk: GOLDSHIRE TAVERN? what were you doing there
[3:44:40] theangrytoddler: whats the go to server for alliance on SoD EU?

[3:45:49] ForzaJuveQ86: beard .. we are aging too fast bro
[3:46:01] stillsuitstk: oh that one
[3:46:03] gambleragain: wetlands orcs
[3:46:19] tvilk: Did you hear about them potentially adding Retail lore into SOD? With Xalatath speculated to be the Void Presence that gives you access to all those void items. It's of course not confirmed but all speculations
[3:46:26] gambleragain: bfd is also naughty
[3:46:41] stillsuitstk: scripe doesnt even know about boid items
[3:46:45] stillsuitstk: void
[3:46:52] Stinth: Corruption v2 Pog
[3:47:39] gambleragain: im totally okay is SOD is a "What if" lore
[3:47:43] stillsuitstk: port to orgirmmar yes
[3:48:05] FireFireFireFireFireFire: anal
[3:48:14] gambleragain: uptight
[3:48:17] gambleragain: dont change
[3:48:20] tvilk: They have said SOD is canon lore. They said SOD is like hidden stories unearthed. Like looking at old pictures in a time capsule that we recently discovered
[3:48:43] Hozzar1: i thought about playing dmc5
[3:48:44] Hozzar1: soon
[3:48:53] Kemskemss: @tvilk HUH
[3:48:57] Honeycrispie: SOD lore omE who gives a shit
[3:48:58] FireFireFireFireFireFire: i guess uptight is the better way to express that sentiment monkaHmm
[3:48:59] Honeycrispie: meme client
[3:49:15] stillsuitstk: dont think so
[3:49:21] stillsuitstk: but what is your gnome gear

[3:51:40] tvilk: Weirdge not reading quest text
[3:51:43] Jack_the_Dipper: kaatHmm
[3:51:55] gambleragain: its what made wow, WOW
[3:51:59] Jack_the_Dipper: O yeah some lore is really good in WoW
[3:52:00] Honeycrispie: its wild KEKW
[3:52:09] tvilk: i used to be a big lore nerd until legion
[3:52:13] FireFireFireFireFireFire: stories FeelsWowMan
[3:52:15] Jack_the_Dipper: For me it all started with WC3
[3:52:15] Charm_pit: but it kinda went to shit and its confusing
[3:52:29] gambleragain: like, the opening of dark portal, the arrival of the lich king
[3:52:33] Hozzar1: preach didn't like story until he did ff14 msq
[3:52:33] gambleragain: big selling points
[3:52:36] Hozzar1: KEKW
[3:52:46] Hozzar1: wow's story isn't the best
[3:53:01] Jack_the_Dipper: Shadowlands really gave me a backstab with the Lich King story
[3:53:02] gambleragain: it might not be the best, but its iconic
[3:53:19] Honeycrispie: the jailer planned everything Kappa
[3:53:23] Hozzar1: issue finding you a singleplayer game you'd like is hard because my favourites having story
[3:53:46] gambleragain: cataclysm lost me too ngl, but im a nerd so i watched and read
[3:53:53] Jack_the_Dipper: True, I mean how many people even read the quest logs
[3:54:17] stillsuitstk: wow
[3:54:24] stillsuitstk: notlikethis
[3:54:27] oxycet_: What realm are u on mr scripe?
[3:54:28] Hozzar1: i'll play devil may cry 5 soon. i'll recommended it you when i've completed it. i heard it's gameplay forced
[3:54:28] Jack_the_Dipper: Warlords and Legion really came back to the main story
[3:54:28] FireFireFireFireFireFire: what about a book with pictures
[3:54:36] spyrit14: The FFXIV story arc took 10 years
[3:54:48] stillsuitstk: now I think rfwf raiders ARE the problem! Disrespecting our lore!
[3:55:07] oxycet_: !realm
[3:55:24] gambleragain: i go lvl 1 to get starsurge, and sunfire
[3:55:27] gambleragain: and HS back
[3:55:28] Honeycrispie: wait until u get starsurge and 1 shot everything KEKG
[3:55:32] gambleragain: its sooooo OP
[3:55:39] stillsuitstk: yeah lvl1 starsurge is insane
[3:55:45] stillsuitstk: i did it as a horde solo
[3:55:49] Honeycrispie: KEKW
[3:55:51] stillsuitstk: was an adventure
[3:55:52] Echo_Esports: Yooo i yoinked a Staforge PC. Best choice of my life . Go yoink yours at: echogg.ly/starforge/Scripe
[3:56:01] Hozzar1: I'll play devil may cry 5 soon. I'll recommended it you when I've completed it. i heard it's game play focused. it's really similar to final fantasy 16
[3:56:24] gambleragain: @stillsuitstk oh as horde must be a pain
[3:56:32] Artem_V: Pog
[3:56:45] Hozzar1: but vergil SmadgeW
[3:56:50] nishayaa: have you tried last epoch?
[3:56:53] Eliannoula: they got the DMC5 combat designer for ff16 so ya, similar :D
[3:57:03] spyrit14: With Archeage 2 they announced less pvp more pve
[3:57:16] gambleragain: im leveling 10 mages to 35, so i can have 10 max alchemists for last phase
[3:57:27] gambleragain: and just cash in with transmutes
[3:58:13] Honeycrispie: pointless
[3:58:15] Honeycrispie: entirely
[3:58:16] uomoinv1sibile: lol vanilla with living bomb, ez life xD
[3:58:16] gambleragain: last phase is gonna be expensive
[3:58:17] Honeycrispie: PogChamp
[3:58:39] gambleragain: plus its passive income, i have 3 characters with raiding professions
[3:58:50] gambleragain: i hate farming
[3:59:00] uomoinv1sibile: just miss i think
[3:59:44] gambleragain: like lvl 60 phase
[3:59:57] gambleragain: its chill tho, one mage takes me 8 hours to 35
[4:00:25] gambleragain: aoe farming is absurd especially now
[4:00:38] Eliannoula: yeah with whats needed you need a lot so not using that knowledge would be lowkey dumb imo
[4:00:38] Honeycrispie: time is money
[4:01:02] tvilk: he just told you
[4:01:03] tvilk: aoe farming
[4:01:14] tvilk: aoe farming
[4:01:14] gambleragain: open world
[4:01:34] gambleragain: but i had a friend help me living bomb, regen rune and living flame, lvl 1 on all 10
[4:02:09] Honeycrispie: imma put in 1/10th of the effort and make 10x as much gold pepelaugh
[4:02:18] tvilk: i wasnt here when you talked about it but yeah druid in SOD is so fun
[4:02:21] tvilk: Sunfire in catform is omega bis
[4:02:36] tvilk: you can kill any mob any level by just running and kiting with sunfire
[4:03:24] gambleragain: its op when you get the holy trio of mage runes lvl 1 :P
[4:03:25] tvilk: I was farming mobs in Thousand Needles during phase 1 for skinning because of cat form sunfire
[4:03:52] neczotv: sir are you gonna play cata?
[4:04:12] neczotv: 2 months left from military will be back to play!
[4:04:12] Echo_Esports: Time for a break...from your current job? Come work with Echo! Apply at: echogg.ly/apply/Scripe
[4:04:13] tvilk: what you dont need a specific account for it
[4:04:20] gambleragain: cat sunfire can kill ANY elite
[4:04:23] neczotv: we will be gaming again soon!
[4:04:24] gambleragain: literally any
[4:04:47] gambleragain: you guys are in Lone Wolf EU ye?
[4:04:51] gambleragain: the echo guys
[4:05:10] tvilk: yeah they had to nerf Sunfire because Cat druids were smurfing on everyone.. 30% increased movement speed, switch forms to dispel slows and unlimited amount of sunfires because it doesnt cost mana
[4:05:17] tvilk: they were gods in pvp during phase 1
[4:06:00] gambleragain: nice, you guys are saving our server, no one popular in Lone Wolf until echo showed up, and our guild was afraid our realm will die cause no streamers
[4:06:05] tvilk: Not in cat form
[4:06:09] drsaud1: BibleThump music
[4:06:10] tvilk: in cat form it costs energy
[4:07:48] gambleragain: okay to be fair, 8 hours per lvl mage at 35 involves like 1h of prep per mage
[4:08:03] gambleragain: living flame resists are big sadge
[4:08:16] tvilk: Scripe learns how rng works
[4:08:21] gambleragain: do you have the frost talents?
[4:08:38] gambleragain: then just unlucky
[4:09:37] tvilk: is this where i come on my druid and help out the gnolls by killing you?
[4:09:47] tankeern: how is tertiary stats not seen as an upgrade, i had the same item i already had drop in mythic raid, but was not allowedto roll on it, cause i had same item that was max upgraded, but no tertiary stats??
[4:09:56] stillsuitstk: @tvilk you are on lone wolf?
[4:10:00] tvilk: @stillsuitstk, yeah
[4:10:06] sfia: scrolls always worth it WICKED
[4:10:40] tankeern: could only greed
[4:10:42] gambleragain: @tvilk then you gonna make me stay stealth on rogue near him and protect :P
[4:10:42] tvilk: Don't worry it will take me 10 hours to get to redridge, by that time you're level 40 KEKW
[4:10:45] tankeern: liek what
[4:11:39] stillsuitstk: @Scripe wanted to kill you but i am another layer... blizzard fix your game so i can streamsnipe!
[4:11:40] Fleymour: wtf happend to scripe.. that bushido beard like +10 strength and +5 dominance or what KEKW
[4:11:54] tvilk: @stillsuitstk, PepeLaugh
[4:11:55] vinnieggwp: why doesnt <echo> participate in classic content?  even if its not as competitive, isnt it good for views?
[4:12:01] Acuyuye: you unlock that beard when u become a dad classic
[4:12:15] tvilk: @vinnieggwp, they did, then they stopped cus of retail content
[4:12:22] tvilk: retail takes priority
[4:12:25] vinnieggwp: true
[4:12:33] sfia: i been playing sod yeah
[4:12:34] tankeern: but how is that a thing OMEGALUL
[4:12:35] Echo_Esports: Gear up for raid with a world-class sitting experience. Enjoy the same long-lasting comfort as Echo, only with the Secretlab TITAN Evo gaming chair: echogg.ly/secretlab/Scripe
[4:12:45] stillsuitstk: @sfia pog
