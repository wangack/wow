[2:55:13] Karbonn: I've seen several layoffs and every one is done differently.
[2:55:16] SaltyTunapants: performance reviews, managers or people above them that know the output and productivity of said department.
[2:55:18] biirrd: Its a mix, first first-in-first-out, then preformentce, and then teams that is not needed
[2:55:21] karaste: typically last hired, first fired
[2:55:25] Amarlian: sometimes they ask managers to cut a couple of people and they have to keep it under wraps
[2:55:26] Karbonn: Sometimes it's internal, sometimes it's an external company that decides.
[2:55:28] 07biby: CEOs are unnecessary nowadays, with AI
[2:55:29] Mecabeast: Productivity vs money earned vs coet to run type of thing
[2:55:29] Eshel: imo it should be a thunderdome type match to decide lol
[2:55:50] thaliase: Well it depends on the reason of the layoff....  Most of the time they go Usefullness of the departments, Management over-pays, time with the compagny ...
[2:55:54] OhNoNotAgain: performance, cost, is the position redundant/etc
[2:55:55] rlenk: Yes, a lot of it is AI driven now but they look at productivity performance reviews etc. Last hired.

[2:56:32] falldrgn: Layoffs SUCK.. ive seen some sketch shit be done.  boss took a department to lunch while we disabled all their access..etc
[2:56:43] Treehop: I loved how Elan's group laid off the people who were in charge of controlling access to the building.  That didn't work out well at first.

[3:49:18] meconium__: lol true
[3:49:18] TheReyruls: Hello
[3:49:19] Syllvn: Might help tbh with the general nonsense around D4, make it more a hype train week or two, rather than letting haters pull it apart for weeks
[3:49:22] hammack52: well this is what happens when you are trying to get a new season in a blizz game every 3 months
[3:50:08] AzedaNA: I feel bad for D4 dev team. I feel like they really try and they just never get a break

[3:52:17] s7wede: After how bad the reception to the Blizzcon fireside chat was, I think they went into battlestations to try and course correct. It's quite clear that since launch the vision of the developers and the community has been at odds.
[3:52:29] ashwing_: They need to push out Seasons faster and the expansion soon. No other choice at this moment.
[3:52:36] AzedaNA: Now you got Elon Musk talking shit about the game LUL
[3:52:53] tlsmith3638: maybe they want to keep it quite and see what last epoch is going to do

[4:13:58] Kaykerrs: They nerfed hunters because there is a focus regen talent further down in the BM tree and that would get abused AF with serpent
[4:14:03] hammack52: its all to the pets
[4:14:11] caluur456: If i can recall, hunters pets dps falls off by a lot past 30
