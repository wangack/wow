[4:43:09] wobble_tv: tettles just had a moment lmao
[4:43:10] Dermortis1990: @Newlander patch is pretty balanced atm. just some usual outliers that perform better then others
[4:43:13] Dillonzer: @xGriefxGodx o7
[4:43:26] Azikielboi: they are in MDI and tettles still is on the "balance is bad" train ICANT
[4:43:26] Moobot: Keep up with highlights during MDI on the Raider.IO coverage page: https://rio.gg/MDIDF3Coverage
[4:43:29] sweetleaf87: next time play feral dude
[4:43:42] Pennywise37: @Dermortis1990 pretty balance for a warrior
[4:43:47] xGriefxGodx: @Dermortis1990 So balanced that these teams are basically running the same composition. Truly balanced.
[4:43:50] kingsno21: 4 dps
[4:43:50] Newlander: @Dermortis1990 Yea, it's good to see.
[4:43:54] cheeky88: lepan triggers trinket cheat death

[4:44:21] Dermortis1990: @xGriefxGodx its a freakin competition... what you expect? to have no gear and lose on purpose? KEKW
[4:44:31] Hurbob14: tobo bottom again
[4:44:48] Rehax: @xGriefxGodx its a torunament, ofc theyre gonna the play the best of the best FailFish
[4:44:52] Eatmeillidan: he wasnt even in boomie form for a while XD
[4:44:58] Pennywise37: tobo playing dps but doing healers damage is kinda funny
[4:45:00] RudeDinosaur: I think resto may do more dmg than this
[4:45:09] IRLAnthiel: this is how most moonkins play to be fair
[4:45:12] xGriefxGodx: @gatorman00 crazy that you pay for a game to a multibillion dollar company only to not see your class/spec (mistweaver for me) ever played competitively at a high level.
[4:45:14] Sollevitum: Its called META "Most Effecient Tactic Available" for a reason ....
[4:45:17] Dillonzer: shoulda cat weaved

[4:45:40] king_of_the_pleb: 4 dps + tank lol
[4:45:43] Pennywise37: @xGriefxGodx mistweaver got playtime in several games
[4:45:47] gatorman00: @xGriefxGodx crazy that mistweaver was played in multiple matches today

[4:46:33] charlesk27: @picc0 TY!'
[4:46:42] honorary_eunuch: @xGriefxGodx That's such a primal thing to feel. It says a decent lot about you that you NEED to see your class represented in a game. Nobody actually serious cares about their class being represented. I agree it's not a good thing, but feeling so involved about it?
[4:46:47] Astolfo_best_girl: Pls don't talk in chat if you aren't a high level player (completed 15+ key)
[4:46:59] Dillonzer: @xGriefxGodx maybe it‚Äôs not the class and the player StillWaiting
[4:47:01] LoveLikeAmelie: this is only a +22?
[4:47:11] karhuu: SP lost to boomy
[4:47:12] moderatygos: a high end competition designed for min maxxing does not mean anything not played is irrelevant
[4:47:17] Spekky: legendary running balance???
[4:47:19] Seletara: that was a really cool pull
[4:47:19] Sebleh: Pls don‚Äôt talk in chat if you aren‚Äôt a high level player (completed 5+ key or M0 of moonkin)
[4:47:20] IRLAnthiel: ITS MDI NOT TGP
[4:47:20] Tatinch: @xGriefxGodx Crazy that mistweaver is the best healer in the game and you are somehow complaining about a speed competition that matters 0 competitive wise in game

[4:47:28] Squozen: gigachad comp
[4:47:35] Arkovx: Not a good tournament if they're wiping constantly on 30's, so they do low keys for speed
[4:47:36] Dillonzer: why isn‚Äôt the class i enjoy being played by other people NOOOO
[4:47:39] Kososen: @doctjohn don't fall for the bait

[4:49:05] gatorman00: legendary cooking
[4:49:07] honorary_eunuch: @JadethunderTV Why is every person that the chat gangs up a troll? He was serious, and I think 2-3 people offered serious responses. Representation is good for everyone, but being mad your class isn't in the MDI is...eh...
[4:49:13] thereallardell: lol..
[4:49:17] knowitallpokemonmaster: @LoveLikeAmelie We're here for a good time not a long time my dude. The point isn't completion, but completing fast

[4:50:39] wakeandbacon95: didnt know they had that lol
[4:50:44] meddl_mmo: @doobie077 Mostly passive healing. For example, Balance Druid has Nature's Vigil, where a portion of damage gets converted to healing. Also, Warlocks are super Tanky in general and Spriest shields / offheals as well
[4:51:13] wobble_tv: @thereallardell i appreciate you

[4:53:17] Quitexplicit: @blepppy destro and aff are good......they are just eclipsed by demo. In pug you cant really pull the numbers you see here as destro. Demo is much more pug friendly.

[4:53:36] Papa_Bair: For refrence, they COULD have healed chromie without a healer. You don't need much, since you get a lot of buff on healing towards Chromie. I've done it before where a pug healer wasn't doing anything, and I healed it as a Brewmaster Monk.
[4:53:40] dolmeniq: no healer, isnt good for wow image , it further deepens the hate towards the class and theres gonna be even fewer healers
[4:53:40] opacawc3: how is Dawgs faster with a resto druid
[4:53:43] Rendal_mj: not scary really just kick
[4:53:55] Sebleh: Moonkin taking a dungeon in MDI. Moonkin mains in shambles. Blizzard actually nerfing them for being part of no healer comps. RIP Moonkin mains.
[4:54:15] BossmanRitz: Rain of Fire is such a boring playstyle as lock
[4:54:25] odium666: omh such a scary pull the adds die before sigile of silence expire...nothing happening omg such scarry
[4:54:29] jedimind_lbc: @Papa_Bair 36 precent is enough for chomie
[4:54:40] Penwryn: @opacawc3 Probably less pausing for health or more brute forcing pulls.
[4:54:46] its_meRyan: Why aren't we seeing disc priest?
[4:54:47] knowitallpokemonmaster: @dolmeniq I don't think this is a trend the majority of wow players will be able to repeat on WoW, and healers are still essential in the other aspects of the game.
[4:54:49] Kylezx: 59s first boss was nuts
[4:54:49] MissMarvel: this is proof balance druid needs a nerf Kappa
[4:54:56] caress___: yeah where is the aug ?? these pulls looks so scary
[4:55:10] Reat_TV: @its_meRyan these aren't 30+ keys

[4:55:30] Quitexplicit: +22 fall is incredibly easy for a 22
[4:55:32] hypolah: A Moonkin in the MDI ?? NOT IN MY WATCH !!! Reset : "Natur's Vigil nerfed by 50%" Blizzard probably
[4:55:38] spannker_: @hotyv after next game i think

[4:55:46] headlocks000: @its_meRyan This isn't the "great push" its the MDI, different event friend
[4:55:50] LexiSaberX: how do they heal chromie without a healer Kappa
[4:55:51] hotyv: man i have Work in 5 hours
[4:55:52] Vendrek: @knowitallpokemonmaster I think this was thought up because of the lack of healers and players not wanting to heal...
[4:55:53] wobble_tv: I just noticed the little arrow menu in the top left of the stream - mind blown
[4:56:01] xGriefxGodx: How come we don't see any warriors, ww monks, enh shamans? Aren't those classes that people play?
[4:56:03] cherise2019: @Moobot is there no group b on friday?
[4:56:04] tribunext: g

[4:56:07] Faelystiri: @LexiSaberX they didnt heal chromie haha
[4:56:17] Hoiver_: @xGriefxGodx other classes do better in mdi pulls
[4:56:18] its_meRyan: Disc Priest slower/worse DPS? Or is it because utility?
[4:56:21] thereallardell: yeah its got some sweet stats for all the teams and runs
[4:56:22] Jackbower2: @dolmeniq this is mdi were you need to ush the envelop of normal comp, route , pulls and such . keep in mind this is pratcite on ptr
[4:56:26] headlocks000: @xGriefxGodx this is a speedrunning competition, not day to day keys
[4:56:33] out_of_kek: @LexiSaberX What is even a Chromie? LUL
[4:56:33] spannker_: @xGriefxGodx Those are classes that ppls dont invite to 27+ Kappa (Personal experience as a WW)
[4:56:43] FoxxGhostboi: !standings
[4:56:46] Ch1ppr: dawg
[4:56:48] Exzipt: @xGriefxGodx there are better classes ofc.
[4:56:48] semifive: There is another group competing next Weekend.
[4:56:54] issue73: @its_meRyan disci will be played in Great Push because of way higher hps and shields, for MDi disci just have too low dps
[4:56:58] xGriefxGodx: @headlocks000 why can't other classes be competitive for speedrunning?
[4:57:02] headlocks000: literally every spec is "viable" up to 20 or so
[4:57:05] Fallenarch11: is this the last series of the day?

[4:57:47] wakeandbacon95: LUL
[4:57:53] xGriefxGodx: How come both teams are always running the same classes/specs? Aren't there like 39 specs in the game? How come we are seeing the same 5 compete against the same 5?
[4:58:06] chasen218: is this last game for tonight?

[4:59:38] moderatygos: not every piece of content is for every person, its ok to like this more than tgp or vice versa. just be kind <3
[4:59:41] vangguardian: is echo out
[4:59:45] Werhammer: @heyitsferris braindemon needs a healer for TGP, you in, resto druid is good now I hear
[4:59:49] wobble_tv: @boonkas1337 just believe in your skills and you can go much further friendo
[4:59:52] Quitexplicit: @spannker_ This season I wanted to go as high as possible but as soon as I started to need to do 24s to increase my rio score there were so few that I gave up eventually, and this comes from a warlock player.
[4:59:57] stiefbruderrr: everyone know u need a bm hunter to really put on a fast time but they dont know how to play it

[5:00:27] heyitsferris: @Werhammer yeah i can pump some crazy dps!
[5:00:28] FoxxGhostboi: Stare
[5:00:31] headlocks000: @xGriefxGodx asking why each team has the same 5 specs. its how speedrunning works. The spec you play is just fine for pushing weekly keys. this is speedrunning, not weekly keys
[5:00:34] knowitallpokemonmaster: TGP i so hard to watch, its hours of non stop dungeon runs with 4 teams on split screen, it's challenging to keep track of whats happening, this is much better for streaming.. IMO
[5:00:40] marlin15: @Afflex The person on the right bottom of the screen
[5:00:46] spicyponcho: VoHiYo
[5:00:52] Shadymoaaa: MDI 22-23 keys ...why so low ?

[5:01:12] spacemunky114: chat, don‚Äôt be weird
[5:01:17] xGriefxGodx: @headlocks000 why cant the other 34 specs be made speedrunning competitive?
[5:01:18] issue73: @Shadymoaaa because either you're trolling or you just dont understand what MDI is.
[5:01:20] greyfox_games: @Shadymoaaa its a speed race
[5:01:23] sl1mgoof: @Shadymoaaa cause its not the great push?

[5:02:02] dinoxxoo1: imagine MDI but instead of god comp, lets do C tier class comp.
[5:02:02] HeySpacecamp: Need another surprise moonkin for the next dungeon
[5:02:03] doctjohn: I like the MDI this year very much until now, AWC was funny also
[5:02:04] out_of_kek: Imagine letting your HP drop to 0
[5:02:06] headlocks000: @xGriefxGodx the game will never be 100% balanced. ever. Its literally impossible
