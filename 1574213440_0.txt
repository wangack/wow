[2:02:08] StarShopping95: LUL
[2:02:16] CrerisRs: well the fact that bots stop scaling at 30 means that they cant go infinitely high on JY itself
[2:02:18] moderatygos: obviously the team will always evaluate the shows and make decisions/updates/changes for future events, but it wasn't an oversight or mistake and to imply so is just not correct
[2:02:20] chunkyb0b: @omniscientautoma They could just start jy at a higher base key lvl and up the cap

[3:01:56] Unholytree: @Kaldeera Didn't 2 chest a 29 Upper Karazhan, whereas Monka did
[3:02:13] kimohunt: @Kaldeera didnt 2 chest upper. so they gonna do 2 dungeons to get 31 timed. that Monka already timed the 31.
[3:02:22] Patrikhg: its a warlock either the mob dies or he dies Kappa

[3:02:29] myamoray: again, the reason that I prefer twitch, is thevtop quality mods.
[3:02:39] Kaldeera: @kimohunt I’d say +1 chesting is still better than dying on last boss of a full run

[3:04:17] kimohunt: @Kaldeera theorically yup. but Echo need to do 2x dungeons to catch up to Monka's +31 timed. overall Echo lose a bit more time.

[4:07:59] talamuwana7: they make the rules guys, that's it

[4:14:07] pnavara: Skalor try do some dungeons  a bit higher than 15+
[4:14:20] Skalor: but still easy
[4:14:29] nyzer307: @passdat22 +17 is still easy
[4:14:35] Skalor: :((((

[4:15:32] Mah1tu: @Skalor 15's are joke mate try to do some +25 keys maybe u get some energy
[4:15:43] ponzudream: it's a team game too, ur party makes a pretty big difference in how 'easy' a key is
[4:15:46] Sleepypan: i mean they arent really that hard unless ur undergeared

[4:16:28] nyzer307: GIGACHADS
[4:16:33] Skalor: @Uchiha_Evil still easy though
[4:16:36] AnxiousAndSad: @Sleepypan Gear is pretty irrelevant with a good group. Could easily time 20s week one this season in last seasons gear. It just helps.
[4:16:41] CozyWoW: That poll is funny
[4:16:42] ponzudream: u can say "recycled" but it's better than nothing and for a lot of us it's "new" cause we didn't play old expansions
[4:16:58] PrewtaEU: when you say 15's are easy, you have to understand that "only" 5-10% of the player base did dungeons at 20 in season 3. just because it is easy for you doesn't mean it was easy for the larger crowd.

[4:17:42] Skalor: @PrewtaEU i was just fishing but youre right, most of players cant even do a timed 15
[4:17:43] epii: but it had challange mode, which evolved into m+
[4:17:47] Sleepypan: @Sleepypan I was timing 20s week one I am aware. Just saying for the average casual ksm player with bit more gear they will even find 15-20 keys easy
[4:17:49] datsussyguy: @PrewtaEU But I mean...they are pretty easy

[4:19:19] Amptie: meeixHi
[4:19:24] Skalor: @pnavara thats a weird % as well, once you need to consider level 60 characters who are just looking for Achievs, pets or doing RP, it counts for Raiderior as "dungeon players"
[4:19:28] Sleepypan: @pnavara interesting

[6:01:14] depen: bizentein is trying a gambit 33 on live
[6:01:16] Nataurz: @Healingstat why are you not in this ?
[6:01:33] billabong212: The debuff is not the bleed lmao the debuff is the slow
[6:01:33] AverageDaeg: it's 100% workshop tomorrow yeah? i feel ID is a free dungeon
[6:01:34] 2SwordArtOnline2: CLICKZ LOL
[6:01:40] moderatygos: he works for the esports team!
[6:01:41] brotan123: clickz just doesn't get the bleed
[6:01:44] just_adz: @Healingstat If only we could do that on Live kalamaziDemo
[6:01:46] riposlavia: you can see the full buff explode there

[6:01:52] normn0: wait yeah so it was clicks lmao
[6:01:53] breekicheeki9: Ouch
[6:01:53] Stormy_o: OMEGALULDANCE
[6:01:55] JDZ1e: PotFriend wtf meeres?
[6:01:55] BlvckMethod: Go back Rupi
[6:02:00] Honeycrispie: The call was to nuke, miscall
[6:02:00] Lianquerry: Couldn't Zaelia pre-SWD and then mass dispell all the debuffs? or was MD on cd?
[6:02:03] Trohuz: is it a guaranteed fortified to make it 3/3 or could it be tyrannical? i'd love to see tyrannical WS
[6:02:04] riposlavia: he had got rid of his 4 runes, and combined them, so he wasnt taking bleed damage
[6:02:05] Naguura: they probably told clickz to not take the dot honestly, because its unhealable to heal 3 debuffs
[6:02:11] IlllIlIIlllIlIIl: griffi82Kek
[6:02:22] Barrymoree: @Naguura veiWave
[6:02:25] Naguura: they didnt even manage to heal 2 debuffs. so they tried to break the shield with 2 dps, it almost worked too if meeres didnt pod
[6:02:33] Reborn81: @Naguura this tbh, they thought combustion and gingi were enough
[6:02:35] billabong212: @Naguura he's basically insta dead if he doesn't take though no?
[6:02:38] brotan123: can you dwarf the debuff after it breaks you out?
[6:02:40] Honeycrispie: yea was so close
[6:02:43] Devinespiritgm: If the teams have access to 'perfect' gear/class choice, is it 'really' fair to call it a 'world record'?
[6:02:44] akoda_: @Naguura even with UR up?
[6:02:50] Liryns: OMG THAT TRANSITION
[6:02:51] Xyronic: no @brok
[6:02:51] Knightsavior: bluporKEKWshake
[6:02:52] CozyWoW: hahaha who did that LOL
[6:02:52] sog1_: LUL
[6:02:54] chubahi: LUL LUL LUL
[6:02:55] Xyronic: @brotan123
[6:02:55] Purinzo: thats painful to watch Sadge
[6:02:56] endobleedz: he ran back to get the puddle but never made it to it
[6:03:01] CrerisRs: @Naguura even with 2 meeres went to pod, definitely couldnt do anything about 3 dotted people
[6:03:04] CozyWoW: that was too funny
[6:03:04] Cyphixoxo: What was that lmao
[6:03:06] onesteplolqt: 🐛 Spam this bug 🐛 To cheer for Dug! 🐛
[6:03:07] ModeraYsera: duhnuhnuhnuhnuh, TETTLESSS
[6:03:18] Naguura: @Lianquerry the debuff can not be dispelled
[6:03:18] DustFlap: jesus christ it's doa
[6:03:20] ophing: naguuraEZ
[6:03:25] Xorado: LETS GO GIGACHADS!
[6:03:30] riposlavia: misclick on trinket prolly, or greedy usage
[6:03:32] brotan123: but something is scuffed with the route if monka can get to the boss at 36 mins
[6:03:45] Lostgravity: Doa is awesome :)
[6:03:50] Sinanzii: Meeix winner? LUL
[6:03:55] Lestatis: I love the storyline that tettles picks favorites as "darkhorses" or "wild cards"
[6:03:57] olivoilolja: echo vs monka tomorrow
[6:03:57] FishAndKids: Arthas!
[6:04:01] tntqt96: @brotan123 31 vs 32
[6:04:06] billabong212: @brotan123 Monka was in a 31 not a 32
[6:04:11] sonartv: mdi lore
[6:04:11] Naguura: @billabong212 no, hes just stunned, not dead. dead = 5 secs timer penalty
[6:04:13] just_adz: De Other Atonement?
[6:04:15] onesteplolqt: wotlk music?
[6:04:20] Eledier: Clikz used resolve and pact before the repentance, which is what let him live the repentance, obviously they just didn't want him taking the dot
[6:04:21] Lonely_TTV: @Lestatis Tettles just picked the order they qualified as
[6:04:25] blinkeys: any borks?
[6:04:27] IlllIlIIlllIlIIl: Gigas was running on 5% power
[6:04:30] DustFlap: that doesn't make up the difference, the route was clearly far better
[6:04:32] chubahi: Tommorow will be epic race day ! cant wait .
[6:04:34] Honeycrispie: They pulled a arachnid after100% aswell, they intended to not pull it but explosive put grp in comb.
[6:04:44] BruhItsKoda1: Monka Lower is 3 min faster
[6:04:48] Arsenickc: 38:56 lower *_*
[6:04:50] lord_windir: GIGACHADS <2
[6:04:52] sonartv: they had some mistakes
[6:04:57] Lonely_TTV: @Eledier only reason he lived the shield bomb is pod his defensives did nothing at all
[6:05:02] ArnesMeyer: theater of other side tommorow
[6:05:04] BrightsideRed: I wanna get to a +20 key
[6:05:08] Moredotshc: yes also with 14 deaths less @BruhItsKoda1
[6:05:14] Eledier: @Lonely_TTV my b, didn't see pod
[6:05:20] BruhItsKoda1: LUL
[6:05:24] ArnesMeyer: today winner is RUPI THE GUY!!
[6:05:32] moderatygos: today's winner for sure is rupi
[6:05:34] Sumirina: he didn't pod tho, right?
[6:05:40] CrerisRs: cant warlocks use burning rush to break off the stun btw? or is that not castable in combat
[6:05:46] Lonely_TTV: @Eledier he pressed pact and unending because he thought he took dot but he walked on edge only
[6:05:47] blinkeys: boopmeDespair
[6:05:47] Sinanzii: @omniscientautoma yes true
[6:05:49] AverageDaeg: RUPI Honourable Mention
[6:05:52] mason_ii: you can do it! @bigturtlebaked
[6:05:52] wEiRdO_dUdE: True, it's going to be even closer
[6:05:57] chubahi: GN all ! cya tommorow
[6:06:05] Sinanzii: HERO OF DAY = RUPİ.
[6:06:06] just_adz: @ArnesMeyer Necrotic Theatre of Tirna Side :)
[6:06:06] Healingstat: GGs all!
[6:06:07] Lonely_TTV: @CrerisRs dark pact is the most broken talent in the game cant pick burning rush
[6:06:09] Sindorein: how many teams is going to globals from this group? only 1 ?
[6:06:11] Sumirina: good night everyone
[6:06:15] moderatygos: ggs today! thanks for all the fun
[6:06:20] lapeiris1234: @crerisrs its a talent instead of dark pact, you never pick that
[6:06:22] ModeraYsera: See you all tomorrow, have a great evening! <3
[6:06:25] Moredotshc: kind of a joke that it's 2 teams per region honestly. EU could easily bring 4 to the global finals
[6:06:27] Cyphixoxo: Hero of the day is the guy doing the scene transitions LUL
[6:06:30] Sinanzii: gg wp cya
[6:06:31] ArcaneNOR: what time tomorrow does it start?
[6:06:32] mason_ii: !weebcheck

[6:06:35] Naguura: @CrerisRs burning rush doesnt break the repentance
[6:06:46] ModeraYsera: @ArcaneNOR 10AM Pacific
