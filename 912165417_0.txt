[1:22:26] LukusLIVE: the infinite chase
[1:22:40] ShadyDax: they deleted stupid AP grind so gear is supposed to be "the grind" of this expansion @Towelliee
[1:22:41] Kysera: I'd like more stuff out of Torghast. I've got one legendary I'll ever use, and it's at 235. Like, give me an Island style vendor with a bunch of cosmetic shit
[1:22:47] TheEnstraynomic: AU where illidan is stuck being a healbot in raids LUL
[1:22:58] KingSlayerYotam: i saw a druid named ligmaballs in BLR lol
[1:23:24] swordwindgaming: the pug grind is brutal, tho
[1:23:41] CritcobainTV: @swordwindgaming nah man, i got AOTC and KSM in pugs
[1:23:49] KingSlayerYotam: do the lockout priest @Towelliee
[1:24:26] kroknows101: Doing Torghast now..... absolutely hate it
[1:24:26] CritcobainTV: @Towelliee Wait, you mean to tell me ur not gonna run Twisting corridors for fun now that you've finished it? Kappa
[1:24:28] Kysera: I think it's fun. There's just nothing else outside of soul ash
[1:24:32] HeIlraiser_: yep we know
[1:24:34] TheNoMansLands: and now they added a calling in Torghast LUL
[1:24:40] Lexi__Marie: island expedition stream when Kappa
[1:24:45] Ademi_tv: Torghast is one of the reasons I quit the game. I felt like it was a bad system.

[1:24:54] Mimonai: if there was a better way to grind anima id farm cosmetics but world quests are boring
[1:24:55] HumanityDH: torghast should give gear how 5 masks used to give gear
[1:25:03] Kysera: I only lasted in bfa 3 weeks before quitting though and I'm still in SL so
[1:25:05] Supers18: the fact that towelliee is saying SL didnt live up to the hype means it really isnt great, usually he is always glass half full kinda guy
[1:25:12] Rudric_Ice: islands r better than torghast
[1:25:15] HumanityDH: and Twisting corridors should have given soul ash
[1:25:18] Thoreya: ^ not really. bfa was fucking trash and he liked it
[1:25:19] Thoreya: lol
[1:25:25] KombatWombat07: torghast is a fun roguelike, just the lack of rewards from it is dissapointing
[1:25:33] Kysera: I'd have liked islands if I could have just gone in solo
[1:25:35] TheNoMansLands: @Thoreya thats exactly what the guy said
[1:25:38] Kromede: epics HYPERS
[1:25:42] kroknows101: You get renown from world boss and some dungeons.

[1:26:06] Xara36: Still no love rocket!?
[1:26:18] Maex: superstrain
[1:26:23] Kysera: Mostly all I do since Legion is M+ though, and the SL dungeons are a lot of fun so it's good for me

[5:25:25] Aervyper: @Towelliee haven't been around in a bit what's your opinion on 9.0.5? To me it sees like while a good fix it really doesn't fix anything it just delays 9.1

[6:12:53] Delkamus04: no GTR?
[6:12:56] gouofmich1972: what don't you get a GT 5.0 and have aftermarket parts put on it. Can do better than the GT500 and save about $20k at least
[6:13:33] marcel0s: what's the range on that electric?

[6:13:33] Aervyper: @Towelliee i just want it to not be -40 where i live
[6:13:34] dirtylurker69: Yes
[6:13:35] Jarlan23: yes
[6:13:39] Vip3rr: Live in Michigan and drove the mach E. Its honestly REALLY nice
[6:13:40] captiv8: the gt350 sounds the best imo
[6:13:42] gouofmich1972: cant say fuk to EV's @AureliusXV . that is where the market is going. CA is already having it mando that by 2035 all new cars must be EV
[6:13:42] RocketMan23: my grandfather had 2 65 mustangs, i miss those cars
[6:14:16] Naynee: Just get a tesla Y bro
[6:14:21] WoW_StandalonE: Mustang interior is kinda meh tbh
[6:14:22] captiv8: they shouldn't have called it a mustang but i have no problems with electric cars. #notamustang
[6:14:27] Vip3rr: Absolutely man, but thats the best part of electric, software updates giving new features overnight, so awesome
[6:14:28] gouofmich1972: it's nice but not a mustang... should have given it its own name
[6:14:42] szeeman62: Forget the Shelby 500 get the Ford get!
[6:14:48] Naynee: Mustang's screen is laggy a f and unintuitive @Towelliee
[6:14:52] szeeman62: GT*
[6:15:11] captiv8: its a discrace to the badge
[6:15:16] Vip3rr: Bro the electric 0-60 will NEVER be beat by a gas car. Instant torque vs gradual shift
[6:15:16] RocketMan23: electric motors and their torque
[6:15:16] sir_skaeg: whats your view on the necrolord warrior buff?
[6:15:25] ChrisarN: Norway is ELectric Car CENTRAL!

[6:17:17] sir_skaeg: i think it might make double prot warr a thing
[6:17:21] captiv8: speed isn't everything, the classic throaty mustang v8 sound is more important to me than the horsepower it produces. To each his own though
[6:17:24] akia03: renown catch up is wierd when you get it like 1 day everything gives it other nothing does
[6:17:33] ChrisarN: WHy havent Boomkin been nerfd already?
