[1:24:23] Lilurrn: No shot it's dead they didn't even pull it for 4+ hours last night while strategizing
[1:24:23] mavericks312: i think the only thing that could hurt echos spirit is if liquid has the boss sub 40% which i dont think it is

[1:24:38] cyrex172: im honestly not a huge fan of watching worlds first races, kinda boring to me, id rather play the game myself, but i get why some people love it

[1:35:39] fennecx25: echo is muting 90% of time
[1:35:40] mavericks312: lets be hones te 1 time liquid hid there strat echo looked lose

[1:36:04] hailstormz: when did it peak? WOTLK?
[1:36:05] Alienfromger: not good for entertainment. they could let the caster do something
[1:36:20] Nerendis: And this on off stream thing is just going to make it smaller and smaller
[1:36:23] ArcaneSyntax: I feel like liquid hasn't been muting as much, but they did pull a bunch off stream
[1:36:29] cazhually: RWF is only entertaining when kills are close

[1:37:30] cazhually: I wish they would honestly do that
[1:37:33] hailstormz: uldir was my first raid tier i did mythic prog on. good times
[1:37:33] xhale2nhale: yea we only saw vids after team was done
[1:37:34] Shrenko: happy birthday @grumpy_1969 towHAMUP towHAMUP !!
[1:37:42] TheeCableguy: Makes perfect sense. You dont race to come out second they are gonna do what they can to win.
[1:37:42] cazhually: than it would be interesting to see what strats were originally created by the different guilds
[1:37:45] Nerendis: I mean I think they will do that, but they are just going to kill what's left of the viewerbase frankly.
[1:37:45] yadungoofed101: tagzz said it last night, the going dark is the future of rwf
[1:37:52] Collected1: i'm surprised they went dark with the lead they had and the confidence max had
[1:38:19] TheeCableguy: nobody wants to lose either
[1:38:29] yadungoofed101: @Collected1 why? they had the lead, why give away strats
[1:38:30] cazhually: echo keeps having internet issues lol
[1:38:48] hailstormz: bring back blood legion
[1:38:49] Pallyofhell: yea theres still some internet issues going on this morning
[1:38:51] Nerendis: IDK man, the viewership is extremely important to orgs in League of Legends. Liquid runs all their teams very similarly to their League team. If they don't have viewers, winning means essentially nothing to them.
[1:38:55] yadungoofed101: @cazhually so does liquid
[1:39:14] Onearmyof2: yeah some of those guys were up for 20+ hours apparently

[1:39:14] theDirtyon3: i think that might have broken echo if they didnt get the kill yesterday
[1:39:23] Lulaboo: Internet for echo wene down again
[1:39:27] TheTazzyBoy: winning means nothing to any of the sponsors if the teams don't get any views LUL
[1:39:28] Lulaboo: went*
[1:39:33] idenkaz_: sup, looking fresh T
[1:39:34] Nerendis: League viewership has actually been tanking for some time now
[1:39:38] theDirtyon3: @Lulaboo yeah this is rough for them
[1:39:41] Pallyofhell: LEC and LCS have lower viewership now
[1:39:41] hailstormz: everything gets broken down to dollar and cents, the second they arent making money we wont see them lol
[1:39:47] instant_savage: they need each other sadly
[1:39:52] Nerendis: 10
[1:39:54] Nerendis: 2013 release
[1:40:13] souljazz: League of Legends announces going dark for championship match
[1:40:14] dinkxv1690: if somthing happened to echo, wouldnt most just join method?
[1:40:15] Pharaoh_326: covid twitch was amazing
[1:40:26] TheTazzyBoy: apparently this years worlds for league is the most watched
[1:40:33] Pallyofhell: covid twitch was wild

[1:41:57] wakeandbacon95: rwf is kinda niche audience
[1:42:18] souleymaster: how about Method they are out of the picture ?
[1:42:24] hailstormz: yeah idk how they can bring new views in
[1:42:25] theDirtyon3: exactly
[1:42:30] theDirtyon3: its stagnant
[1:42:32] jharvey1229: rwf hasnt been as exciting in awhile
[1:42:40] mavericks312: method is 8 hrs behind on tindral yet
[1:42:57] Nokterian: Uh oh echo no internet?
[1:43:04] yadungoofed101: Skyline just had their reset today right?
[1:43:14] Collected1: Method being on the final boss at the same time as the other two would be a step forward for them
[1:43:26] souleymaster: Wow Sloot didn't raid this expansion i am surprise
[1:43:40] theDirtyon3: KEKW
[1:43:41] Nerendis: They are on Taiwan
[1:43:44] Nexxious: the last like 15% of that fight comes down to a half second thing that can wipe ya
[1:43:45] yadungoofed101: they are taiwan
[1:43:59] mavericks312: sloot retired after abberus
[1:44:09] Cabbageman007: slootSmug slootSmug slootSmug
[1:44:14] Maruika: he for sure gonna come back
[1:44:24] hailstormz: retail raiding is so unforgiving. 90% of classic raiders couldnt deal with those mechanics
[1:44:28] ninoska12: It's not surprising these things don't bring in any viewers, what's more boring than watch someone work, when you probably don't even understand half of whats going on.  WoW isn't for new people anymore, there's too much going on in every single thing.
[1:44:48] mavericks312: i wonder if he would comeback if variety has a dry year
[1:44:51] Nerendis: BDG went into this expac real hot. But it didn't last. It's really unfortunate that Golden Guardians has had so many money issues because the GM really liked the WoW idea
[1:45:08] theDirtyon3: he gets to play every game he wants, half of them he gets for free i would love variety life too
[1:45:13] Cabbageman007: slootSmug  said he will Try out 11.0
[1:45:13] Lulaboo: all the big org casts are running commercials at the top of the hour so they are making big ass ad revenue
[1:45:18] rashomon1337: Dota viewership would be even bigger than it is if it wasn't bought and run by a trash company such as Valve
[1:45:18] yadungoofed101: @Nerendis no worries, BDG still bricked up LuL
[1:45:28] Collected1: theres a reason people like Sco, Roger etc are now behind the scenes
[1:45:31] Nexxious: GG just dipped out of NALCS as well
[1:45:34] Collected1: you get to a point where you just can't give whats required anymore
[1:45:38] Nerendis: The NBA org cut their funding by like 80% with covid and just never got back up
[1:45:51] Pallyofhell: GG lost their slot in LCS
[1:46:01] mavericks312: we shouldnt be to suprised BDG is still a top 10 guild tanks are the easiest to replace
[1:46:08] hailstormz: thats wild
[1:46:20] Nerendis: @Pallyofhell This is not correct
[1:46:36] Pallyofhell: GG didnt just dip out LUL
[1:46:40] Nerendis: They sold their slot
[1:46:58] Pallyofhell: just like echo fox did
[1:46:59] mavericks312: if you care about winning you aint sponsoring anyone lol
[1:47:01] hailstormz: drop the bag and buy max lol
[1:47:06] Nexxious: GG did not lose it, they gave it up. read more into it

[2:48:01] DarkTimesAhead: Probably Cap, but they did do a lot of pulls offline so who knows.

[2:48:11] d2darkalliance: echo is going win this
[2:48:20] Prisana: Everyones been getting that
[2:48:39] Pallyofhell: its the world quest reward
[2:48:40] mavericks312: @d2darkalliance if there actually at 29% they will look like they did last tier
[2:48:47] ArcaneSyntax: Liquid spent like 3 hours pulling aint no way they got the boss down to 29
[2:49:12] usmcbrin: do you think your guild will clear mythic in time?

[2:51:06] fennecx25: wheere does it say 29?

[2:51:52] Eviltuna13: ECO throwing it so Blizz is forced  to same day release sacJAM
[2:52:01] mavericks312: @Masqerader they went dark last night so it stopped tracking
[2:52:02] Nerendis: @Masqerader If they stop the stream they stopped logging
[2:52:08] Collected1: they've not been updating logs
[2:52:08] Armdel: 63% was before they turned off stream
[2:52:11] ArcaneSyntax: 63% is from last night

[2:53:29] Ezekyler: my bet is around 40-45%
[2:53:40] mavericks312: hell look how long 5% to echo last night
[2:53:40] jilech: max is live
[2:53:48] mavericks312: i say 35%
[2:53:49] Himouto_Life: I love wow but those dedicated to RWF is something beyond my comprehension
[2:53:50] yooyoo1337: no way
[2:53:56] Alsparq: They have beat their best 4-5 times in the last couple hours so they are more consistent at getting to the end of the fight
[2:54:03] Nerendis: Yeah, it would be dumb to keep logging if you turned the stream off lol
[2:54:44] Masqerader: @mavericks312 and that's why I said if it's delayed and not been updated, and i remember them being around 68% last night or something
[2:55:07] yooyoo1337: time flies when you're having fun.

[6:03:21] Fangy_Playz: I'm sure max gets a nice cut for being in the commercials too.
[6:04:23] Tupacent: All due respect to Sco but he pumps off ads every 10-15 minutes 4-6 at a time! He is a good lad though.
[6:04:44] Aidler: somehow it seems Max just can’t win… only suboptimal options
