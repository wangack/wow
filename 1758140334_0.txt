[2:32:32] Therealhighd: @Fortvila gives you a mog for tier shoulders with  a lightning effect
[2:32:51] Therealhighd: and helm i think?
[2:33:00] Nailez: @Fortvila you get lightning effect on tier model shoulders/helm as a transmog
[2:33:06] Based80s: i mean the transmog is for the heroic/normal versions of the sets
[2:33:14] Based80s: not they mythic version
[2:33:40] amaaar314: this week was hell for healers i did my 10 keys and never logged in :(
[2:33:46] Cheapesttactics1: When 10.7 comes out you gonna change your monk to a goblin??
[2:33:51] Hebrewish012: yeah i guess its keystone hero at 2500 ksm is 2000 which is super easy
[2:34:15] Based80s: ksm isn't even all 14s timed this season, it's a joke
[2:34:19] reggiepowa: monk has good mobility on its own
[2:34:39] reggiepowa: yeah pretty much

[2:34:50] Shiz_zap: damn
[2:34:53] darkkilla1: next season they are gonna give us teeming and necrotic on the same week to replace bursting and grevious
[2:34:57] amaaar314: you need all 20s for ksm hero i think
[2:34:58] joe_theviking: @Based80s Negative its for the Heroic/Mythic. The lightning effects from 2500 only apply to heroic and Mythic set variants
[2:35:07] thecynicalshuffler: yeah but gobbies are getting big rocket penises in the new patch.. so, theres that
[2:35:12] LspN: im at 2500 with AV at 17

[2:36:50] theDirtyon3: im 2426 with no guild just pugging everything
[2:36:53] darkkilla1: i just need to stop making alts and knock out KSM on my enh shaman
[2:36:53] Exodeo_: Nokhud is my bane though, can't seem to time anything above 10s on that
[2:37:07] warrenny: Got ksm in like 8 weeks so semi casual im getting curve Wednesday or Thursday
[2:37:12] pronkk_: me? im a hunter
[2:37:13] joe_theviking: @Based80s Did you upgrade your shoulders all the way up? You get 2 transmog colors at the vendor. You'll have the 2 blue variants and the 2 grey
[2:37:17] Bayne77: psh i got 2500 just doing crafting
[2:37:18] KorbenDallas_MP: @Exodeo_ what class?
[2:37:18] reggiepowa: casual can relate to skill level or the amount of time you can play
[2:37:20] GodKingMuninn: im 2560ish, pretty casual and spend most time RPing

[2:37:50] Based80s: @joe_theviking i have 3 sets of shoulders w/ the effect on them, it also applies to the normal set as well
[2:37:53] Exodeo_: @KorbenDallas_MP Blood Dk, it's the rest of the group that seems to always go into chaos though, people just don't do tactics in pugs in that place
[2:38:12] captain_khyzan: 10.0.7 when?
[2:38:14] Teknofear64: Antitowel?
[2:38:20] Teknofear64: what did I miss?
[2:38:34] joe_theviking: @Based80s Well GG then lol my normal ones arent like that, only heroic and mythic LUL
[2:38:36] Fortvila: i switched of BDK cause of that. Got way to tilted by dps and healers fuckign up mech. At least as dps i can focus on my own dps instead
[2:38:49] KorbenDallas_MP: @Exodeo_ very fair - lol AV + RLP are my worst only @ 15's for both (Pres Evoker)

[2:40:51] darkkilla1: i am going with late apiril/early may for 10.1
[2:41:16] KorbenDallas_MP: @Exodeo_ ppl dont tend to stack when the AOE comes out - the ranged are just off on the outer edge just fapping
[2:41:43] reggiepowa: I dont think they will do that anymore
[2:41:45] Exodeo_: @KorbenDallas_MP Yep, and other times healers don't grab the orbs at all
[2:41:53] reggiepowa: releasing everything at once completely killed all the hype for mythic raid
