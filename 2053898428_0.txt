[1:38:39] SamuraiWillZ916: who you raiding on today?
[1:38:48] Molvonos: I personally hated SM as dungeons, so only ran it for quests.

[1:50:52] raye_gaming22: this tier was not easy we killed Fyrak like 2 weeks later than we Clear usually
[1:50:53] DunzoCD: @sinlesssinner you could turn dreamsurge gear into tier as well, the biggest difference was the ring, and thats ok because that ring was OP from forbidden reach
[1:51:13] 91Niki: New World or Lost Ark
[1:51:31] Molvonos: I ended up rage tweeting the Diablo team last night.

[2:26:40] wEiRdO_dUdE: I think the city nodes and evolving world can be cool, but if I get ganked every time I go mining, to heck with that
[2:27:00] Molvonos: Tried to be sneaky with that emote, Moobot still got your ass.
[2:27:01] Molvonos: lol
[2:27:22] Molvonos: p2w
[2:27:25] 91Niki: KEKW
[2:27:28] wEiRdO_dUdE: Then Ashes is building this interdependency where you can't be a miner and a weaponsmith
[2:27:35] Sennica95: So did we get any context to those tweets from the devs?
[2:27:49] dracullus: @KineasRM wow classic formula "level slowly and raid on max level" simply doesn't work at least since wod (yeah I know they dropped level slowly part over years), that's why wow classic even with huge nostalgia base has to relaunch every few months
[2:28:17] Sennica95: Lmao ü§£
[2:28:29] 91Niki: AND poe2 will be using poe1 cosmetics HYPERS
[2:28:51] KineasRM: @dracullus i get it, but since i've been playing wow since TBC, i dont care about the leveling anymore, just give me content on the endgame, raid, dungeons, M+ and i'm good
[2:29:26] TamaskaVT: Two games I'd like to see return to the modern day MMO scene are Ultima Online and Everquest
[2:29:35] 91Niki: No
[2:29:41] mozavich: imagine thinking wow classic was about raiding.
[2:29:45] 6all: no way to tell
[2:29:48] medanmarko: Nah, there are plenty of new mechanics for that to happen.
[2:29:58] KineasRM: no joke, i was kinda done with WoW untill they added M+ and now wow has never been better
[2:30:01] SnackshotGod: @dracullus i dont think they relaunch "every few months"
[2:30:06] Karbonn: Any plans to play Last Epoch?
[2:30:15] KaisenSiru: @Molvonos Didn't even know about it and just wanted to use the emote not even thinking of the name of it for the funny visual. No single thought in trying to be sneaky with anything. anniesShrug
[2:30:16] DunzoCD: wouldnt that be sad lol PoE 2 comes out and everyone still plays tornado shot
[2:30:31] KineasRM: i do raid HC tho, cant be botter with mythic
[2:30:39] 91Niki: @Karbonn He is gonna, yes
[2:30:54] mozavich: imo, m+ is just the same rehashed content over and over. I don‚Äôt find it exhilarating or fun at all.
[2:31:31] wEiRdO_dUdE: There should be more nerfs after Hall of Fame closes, yes
[2:31:49] dracullus: @SnackshotGod 2019, season of mastery, hardcore, now season of discovery - and no one really want stay there, people expect season will end and they will start over
[2:32:03] Molvonos: @KaisenSiru lol, I figured, I had to gander at the emote to see why you got kicked, since it wasn't one of the usual offenders.  Moobot's smarter than I am.
[2:32:04] KineasRM: @mozavich is going that way cause ppl keep crying about affixes. but is not, its a challenge type content with loot
[2:32:15] raye_gaming22: the privat auras changes made the boss so mutch easier

[2:33:36] raye_gaming22: exactly and the chanegs makes this boss like a 200 pull one
[2:34:12] Wulfgrym: i feel that philosophy sorta bleeds into all the teams d4 team does stupid stuff like this too.
[2:34:28] DunzoCD: yeah they should just let the 1% do the 1%ers thing
[2:34:29] symbolflood: symbolflood subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 4 months! 
[2:34:53] metavahn231: its been 20 years of addons doing the work they aint gonna change it
[2:34:56] Wulfgrym: yeah who cares what the 1% do, they are the 1% for a reason LUL
[2:35:10] KineasRM: @mozavich by cucking the affixes as the comunity demands, the experience of running a dungeon keeps getting closer to the dungeon withou affixes, making your statement that it is reharshed conttent valid
[2:35:41] Shellstars: Hi Towelliee Hi chat. Hope everyone is well :)
[2:35:42] raye_gaming22: @Heero_Effect its stuff that weakauras and addons cant track so we had to use macros to play arround it
[2:36:07] Wulfgrym: game should cater to the majority of the community, if the game is cleared fast by the elite groups, so what
[2:36:34] KaisenSiru: @Molvonos It's all good, but now I am aware now with the phrase and it being banned. I was completely oblivious and was shocked initially

[2:36:40] mozavich: @kineasrm appreciate it but my opinion doesn‚Äôt need validation. it‚Äôs my opinion. others are perfectly fine if they think it is a wrong take.
[2:36:55] dracullus: @Wulfgrym imo most stupid decision for d4 was starting seasons right away, other diablo games had time to breathe, release fixes and expansion, then seasons started
[2:36:58] SamuraiWillZ916: what you think of the new runes for p2? pretty excited for 2h tanking im gonna make that shit work
[2:37:23] DunzoCD: it sounds terrible, spending pulls on just learning a weak aura and not even the fight as much would just be complete ass
[2:37:35] Eggspoached: This was probably the best expansion for casual players, my Guild killed H Fyrakk and got AOTC very early and we raid 1 night a week for 3 hours
[2:38:02] mozavich: @dracullus I think so too. d4 tries so hard to get into the d3 type seasons so quickly that they didn‚Äôt allow their game to get fixed
[2:38:04] Wulfgrym: @dracullus i can sort of agree, but they had no end game so the game would be super dead right now. All these addons coming, itemization etc should of all be in the game at launch not added season after season
[2:38:30] KineasRM: i mean, IMO what allows wow to have better Dungeon and Raid mechanics than other MMOs is the fact that the devs just accepted that players have Addons like BigWigs or WA, giving up on that could take wow back some years.
[2:39:10] ambiotic: And those last 3 bosses are still super fucking hard, still surprised they havent fully gutted it yet
[2:39:26] Wulfgrym: @Towelliee thats what i was meaning, things like the private auras still affected the other mythic guyys jsut to stop the world first guilds.
[2:39:50] ambiotic: Smoldy, Tindral and Fyrak should all be nerfed so some more guilds can get cutting edge
[2:39:58] Wulfgrym: honestly once the top 5 guilds finish the tier raid, the special mechanices should be disabled

[2:40:21] ambiotic: You could only farm mounts
[2:40:33] ambiotic: Cutting edge was over s4
[2:40:34] dracullus: @Wulfgrym nothing wrong with non-live service (which diablo would be before seasons) and non-pvp game to be 'dead' after hype ends and game is finished, cyberpunk was 'dead' after release too and now look what happened
[2:40:34] Shellstars: Hey Towelliee did you end up get the Love Rocket last year? just wondering as I was watching you go for it but I might have missed you getting it. Jus curious
[2:40:39] KineasRM: @Towelliee do we have a date on next patch already?
[2:40:44] raye_gaming22: na you could olny get mounts but not CE
[2:40:52] Wulfgrym: yeah thats what i mean the private auras sorry for being unclear
[2:41:05] Wulfgrym: @dracullus you're not wrong
[2:41:07] ambiotic: i mean hall of fame just filled up, so they were slow to nerf

[3:03:39] vodkablaq: walnut wood is darker
[3:03:50] Shrenko: @bluetip84 okay thats pretty cool! you have to pay anything extra other than shipping?
[3:03:53] Rhymm: thats for priest rune
[3:03:55] TamaskaVT: Walnut would be more mahogany
[3:03:58] Eviltuna13: paladin rune mob
[3:04:01] geokouts: undead labor ithink it is for a priest rune
[3:04:17] metavahn231: why doesnt he just keep it then
[3:04:18] bluetip84: @Shrenko if you want them in top loaders its like 15 cents. nothing major
[3:04:22] metavahn231: prob be 100k in a few years
[3:04:27] PotbellyGoat: them mislabeling the wood is funny
[3:04:32] raldrik: That is 100 cherry. Walnut grain is almost black when stained
[3:04:33] ambiotic: Nah they will tell you get fucked, they wont put their name on an auction if they are not 100%

[3:06:32] serawrbear: heck yes
[3:06:38] PigPenLen: never done, keep running lol
[3:06:43] Wulfgrym: had to see wife off to work, so walnut is the rarest
[3:07:08] ambiotic: I do love the spectral cards tho
[3:07:19] Wcvechten: got loverocket on my first kill  this year ayo
[3:07:34] raldrik: Also the wood cards if they were going for that much would be faked and noone could tell the difference. If you scanned a bamboo you could easily recreate it on any wood with a laser engraver that etsy people use
[3:07:39] PigPenLen: just saw carrot top on tv in vegas and all I can say is damn i am old
[3:07:40] ambiotic: Yea I think the drop rate might be fucked cause twitter is full of mount pictures today
[3:07:45] SamuraiWillZ916: for the thunderfury 1 of 1?
[3:07:50] Wulfgrym: @Towelliee i just saw your dm KEKW
[3:08:04] raldrik: that patterning in the holo and such make faking cards alot harder than this wood would be
[3:08:38] HaxzorJimDuggan: but yeah with the fact that anyone could just stain the cards you could never trust it to be real
[3:08:45] Wulfgrym: someone who works around wood but not a super expert, that shit is funny as hell
[3:08:51] ambiotic: That does not seem like a good design choice lol
[3:08:52] HaxzorJimDuggan: given that they made a error
[3:08:58] geokouts: i can only indedify i wood by saying... yeap thats a wood :P
[3:08:59] hound0teon: Thats...hard Kappa
[3:09:30] bluetip84: the weights will be different
[3:09:36] Niksen_99: Do you think  blizzard should add a couple Classic ERA servers that start from scratch ?
[3:09:38] bluetip84: bamboo is so light walnut is dense
[3:09:41] metavahn231: take it to da pawn shop
[3:09:43] SamuraiWillZ916: did they use real wood?
[3:09:50] hddndoors: the wood is the grain, the stain is the color
[3:09:52] metavahn231: $200 ez

[3:10:39] Wulfgrym: that shit is amazing
[3:10:43] aspiration89: @penandsword49 My condolences lol. That's the worst.
[3:10:45] Mazerbeam: They likely have a lacquer that prevents staining
[3:10:45] Auxiliator: Also if you put walnut stain on Cherry wood it will turn out weird and won't look right. use to do cabinetry for a while.
[3:11:10] Eggspoached: I ran outta Arthas sad face

[3:46:38] Shrenko: you have to be lvl 60+ to get mount right?
[3:46:45] Swigs175: 8 slot bag I think
[3:47:10] Masqerader: I think it's always the previous level cap
[3:47:20] Masqerader: from the previous expansion
[3:47:24] DunzoCD: is it still where only your 1st char has the only real chance of getting the mount?
[3:47:25] DrkPhoenix6913: historically it's been cap level - 10 gets the appropriate blue bag
[3:47:29] Masqerader: ya
[3:47:37] Masqerader: @DunzoCD yes

[3:55:19] valianya: Follower dungeons are for story mode or for alts.  I think it's especially meant to be for Chromie Time eventually or for new players who can't find a full group to run old content dungeons for the quests

[3:55:55] Exodeo_: I did a follower dungeon.. it took so much more time than the normal dungeons lol, followers kept pulling random crap
[3:56:08] Wcvechten: It's for the supercasuals and new players no? not for us
[3:56:15] PolishMike1982: Yeah but even then ppl are rushing and skipping what they can, so I was glad I could do all Q / story with followers.
[3:56:24] ClassicMalcontent: @WoWRoach yeah mine too but  a ton I never bothered to do a dungeon with. Now their quest logs will clear out
[3:56:37] bigcountry555: its definitly made to test the follower system
[3:56:41] ClassicMalcontent: @PolishMike1982 exactly
[3:57:19] ClassicMalcontent: More like no one is complaining so its a good thing.
[3:57:25] Wcvechten: most  people that use it probably  don't know about reddit or twitch or anything either I'd imagine
[3:57:38] Exodeo_: Because 10.2.5 barely had other content ;p
[3:57:39] AzedaNA: That is like the FFXIV rip off thing right? Where NPCs hang with you?
[3:57:40] Heero_Effect: ff 14 comparison maybe?
[3:57:48] AzedaNA: I personally like that in FFXIV. I just wish they weren't so slow
[3:57:49] valianya: @towelliee if you're leveling in Chromie Time or a newbie doing old content then Follower Dungeons is a godsend.  It takes hours to get a dungeon group for old dungeons in old expansions
[3:57:53] GutsInstinctTV: I don't know if you can or not, but what if you could transmog your followers with gear you have collected for yourself?
[3:58:29] ClassicMalcontent: @valianya that too good point
[3:58:39] WoWRoach: @valianya But it only works for Dragonflight dungeons
[3:59:00] TamaskaVT: Will you be playing the BETA for War Within?
[3:59:04] ClassicMalcontent: They haven't back ported to old dungeons yet? Dang
[3:59:21] valianya: I think they're going to extend the Follower Dungeons system to older expansions in stages as part of making old expansions more player friendly as a story mode to let players experience old expansion storylines
[4:00:01] Kavieonn: What is a beta?
[4:00:17] DunzoCD: Pikaboo won
[4:00:19] WoWRoach: The MOve beat Liquid.  And some random team beat Echo

[4:10:37] JMoney_1331: don't even need one. Get a $25 gift card and you can use it without needing a membership
[4:10:45] valianya: American fast food places in other countries are vastly superior in menu choices and quality than in America because Americans will accept lower quality and less variety than the standards required in other countries
[4:11:01] Lulaboo: Yeah the gift card thing is legit, they let you have a day pass for having a gift card or using the pharmacy

[4:21:35] abawatache: same here, love the level cap to allow folks to have time to explore and have fun at each phase and helps prolong the fun of SOD
[4:21:38] Molvonos: It gives people time to gear up.  I think t hat's ultimately why they did it in the fashion they did.

[6:30:17] shmasherd: think they meant compete?
[6:30:17] MattyNiceTV: i think he means player count
[6:30:20] dinomiyte: LOL just no
[6:30:20] Dawnyan: If I recall from the roadmap, SoD phase 4 or 5 drops near TWW release, but I don't think they'll compete that hard
[6:30:28] theszoti: do you think they will announce 10.2.6 this week or no?
[6:30:36] MaximumSerg: i think he meant compete  for players
[6:30:42] the_general01: im pretty sure they wonder if sod will be on par with war within
[6:30:58] JoshuaTree6969: more than peak wrath?
[6:31:00] jkitchin75: will sod take palyers away from retail is what hes saying @Towelliee
[6:31:26] Vendralos: WoW was an Anomaly at that time
[6:31:29] Screamnsteam: there was halo EZ
[6:32:01] maka94noctis: y and most of them r decent now
[6:32:10] Niksen_99: Classic launch prob the closest to peak wrath
[6:32:11] Vendralos: Social media was also in it's infancy to some degree, and people played MMOs for the social experience
[6:32:37] jkitchin75: @Niksen_99 lol
[6:32:39] dinomiyte: LUL
[6:32:39] Vendralos: No shot
[6:32:46] popzagon: under 1.5mil
[6:32:49] the_general01: @Niksen_99 i just spit my coffee. thanks for that.
[6:32:52] closetn00b: these people have been smelling the chemical bro mixtures
[6:32:55] xendros78: drugs are bad, mmmk
[6:33:04] jkitchin75: nice hot take
[6:33:05] Screamnsteam: classic release wrath killer he says KEKW
[6:33:11] drewetling: lag jebaited
[6:33:13] Niksen_99: i said closest since wrath peak. Still way off
[6:33:20] micker1015: Palworld closer to Wrath than Classic launch
[6:33:31] AudioJaq: You constantly say that retail out performs classic, but there‚Äôs no metric that shows that.
[6:33:34] Vendralos: @Niksen_99 I think retail expansions are bigger
[6:33:40] Erthrix: classic launch was like 1.1 mil
[6:33:58] JoshuaTree6969: the proof is in the number of servers
[6:34:05] Vendralos: Retail expansion launch is generally pretty massive for a week or so
[6:34:08] maka94noctis: how much did start of wod have?
[6:34:47] theszoti: what about shadowlands launch? that was during covid so everyone was home and had nothing better to do
[6:34:54] maka94noctis: wod wasnt that bad it just took way 2 long w/o content
[6:35:20] trivotix: They gave up on wod
[6:35:22] Deyoe: @theszoti SL would have been popular at launch regardless I think, just thematically
[6:35:23] jkitchin75: @theszoti whats shadowlands
[6:35:36] 3663Sharad: Sl had the "covid players"
[6:37:03] drewetling: 10k to start
[6:37:07] Vendralos: The addon just bullies you lol
[6:37:48] Vendralos: The WoW ecosystem is still quite strong, for sure
[6:38:06] theszoti: what would be the fourth then?
[6:38:27] Screamnsteam: runeacape
[6:38:31] plumparock1: Guild wars 2 still stronk
[6:38:36] Eggspoached: ESO or SWTOR
[6:38:46] AudioJaq: The metrics we have available to us: viewership indicates that classic peaks higher than retail regularly. I understand that‚Äôs viewership. So I‚Äôm not sure that retail consistently outpaces classic.
[6:38:52] Vendralos: @plumparock1 People sleep on Gw2, but I think it's doing pretty decent
[6:38:52] maka94noctis: swtor is nearly dead no?
[6:39:04] Segui25: Easily FFXIV at 4
[6:39:04] JoshuaTree6969: i really dont know how anything tops wow when all its competition just tries to emulate it
[6:39:16] Niksen_99: I think there is even wow private servers with more players than some MMO games LUL LUL
[6:39:43] Eggspoached: I‚Äôm not sure on SWTOR, I haven‚Äôt turned it on in over a year
[6:39:47] maka94noctis: well if u combine all pservers than def
[6:40:53] 91Niki: I feel sorry for those who have heavy FOMO and wants to play all version LUL

[6:41:44] mozavich: LOL private servers
[6:42:00] ambiotic: They should, i would love to go back and do the old raids
[6:42:01] 07biby: cuz swotr hasnt changed... doesnt need classic
[6:42:15] LeoricDidNothingWrong: aion classic was recently
[6:42:17] 3663Sharad: Pax Dei eraly access in spring too
[6:42:19] xendros78: because swtor is a zombie that should be put out of it's misery
[6:42:31] N3llee: my heart can not handle all this xbox/micro turmoil
[6:42:45] jarilrpg: square could do FF11 classic servers or something
[6:42:46] temp3st98: we still ¬®still¬® get cataclysm this year Kappa
[6:42:53] maka94noctis: no he sayd above that theres even more ppl on pservers than some mmo's
[6:42:58] ambiotic: How can you count the servers and think to yourself classic has more people
[6:43:01] ambiotic: its basic math
[6:43:03] JangoMigo: im playion lost ark just too i like the aoe combat
[6:43:25] Niksen_99: Would you call it classic at that point? With Cata
[6:43:39] AudioJaq: Clearly the concept of viewership as a metric is a fallacy, but to the end that I think classic and retail go back and forth taking the lead probably.
[6:43:58] Eggspoached: SWTOR-so much lost potential
[6:43:58] Moobot: https://twitter.com/towelthetank/status/1743035635030691892
[6:44:00] jarilrpg: why is this 10 instances an hour still a thing?
[6:44:08] ambiotic: Money
[6:44:15] mozavich: cata is still classic yes
[6:44:22] Molvonos: The Drake Armor is first clear per account of the day.
[6:44:24] Molvonos: So, woo.
[6:44:28] xendros78: only reasons EA hasn't shot swtor in the head is the cartel market printing money and the fact it's the only star wars mmo in town
[6:44:35] popzagon: D[oes anyone else still get brew of the month mail. only on 1 toon
[6:44:43] 91Niki: Yeah I don't think so either
[6:44:45] Ckraigfriend: just got the love armor from my first kill

[6:45:11] AudioJaq: That‚Äôs how you respectfully disagree and still have a discussion folks. Cheers.
[6:45:15] theszoti: you have to consider that classic (except maybe sod) is not casual friendly at all

[7:23:50] 07biby: gloves...
[7:23:58] Nyytro84: it uses your eyes and doesnt uses a controller just hand motions
[7:24:04] MackPlays: People in 1924 couldnt even imagine the tech we have now, in 2124 it'll be just as unrecognizable
[7:24:13] polaropposite76: what's the deal with people sending blank trades over on epack asking for 3 or 4 of my things but nothing from them

[7:32:13] HaxzorJimDuggan: look like you are lost trying to find a ski lift
[7:32:27] Arocian: LOL
[7:32:28] whisperlude: you only look crazy cause it's not the norm. Once it becomes the norm, it wont be crazy
[7:32:32] MackPlays: Ad free glasses lol
[7:32:42] TheGamingDead: What ever happened to google glasses?
[7:32:44] Niksen_99: When they make electric cars as fast to charge as filling gas... Everyone will be driving electric
[7:32:47] dwolters_the_zombieman: California is a unrealistic state for wanting all ev vehicles that's why a lot of truck drivers don't go there
[7:32:47] ChinoX_L: it reminds me of Ready Player One
[7:32:59] rjd33: it's got a long way to go
[7:33:08] valianya: The only reason that walking on public streets and driving with the headset is technically legal is because it's so new there's nothing existing in laws that includes it or takes it into consideration when writing laws
[7:33:09] ambiotic: Elon wants to put a chip in my head and I will go john connor
[7:33:11] CouchRanger: @ChinoX_L 100%
[7:33:12] Djhawk26: Was wearing my love and rockets tee yesterday
[7:33:20] pbnj_kills: we can all see the vision but it for sure isnt where it should be yet
[7:33:23] Nyytro84: its all about AR
[7:33:28] Niixten: soon we will have shells instead of paper LUL
[7:33:29] 91Niki: @Towelliee Gattz and his coworkers was just talking about that yesterday. Imagine that thing in your brain Elon is working on. Randomly everyone is just gonna stand still for 2 minutes while ads are being played for you, and then continue working KEKW
[7:33:29] ChinoX_L: until Elon musk comes out with that Neuro chip that unlocks the capacity of your brain
[7:33:29] MackPlays: Lots of kids use VR chat
[7:33:31] MackAttack1421: Did you see that crazy new VR floor where you can full sprint in any direction on the spot?
[7:33:33] zyzzzly: Not everything is the next iPhone. Just because there are similarities does not mean exact same story
[7:33:41] plddn: at makes ppl dizzy so it‚Äôs a no go

[7:33:45] matthewkshearer: VR gaming and 3D movies came and went like a fart in the wind
[7:33:46] Karbonn: @Towelliee Remember how hard they pushed 3D TV's and how that crapped out so fast? LUL
[7:33:48] Arocian: Wall E coming true
[7:33:49] pbnj_kills: vr makes me sick
[7:33:49] MackPlays: It's about the next generation, not ours
[7:33:50] plddn: vr*
[7:33:55] Heero_Effect: @91niki lol
[7:33:55] blueboywiz: crypto games too
[7:33:59] MackAttack1421: No, that is VR headset
[7:34:04] MackAttack1421: I am talking about the floor
[7:34:05] ambiotic: Have you all not seen a single movie from the 80s, I mean total recall for effs sakes. No thanks
[7:34:16] CousinAvi86: ya she put her knee through the over door glass
[7:34:20] Nyytro84: VR replaces reality AR adds to it thats why it will stick and the other didnt
[7:34:21] Auxiliator: @91Niki in the next 5ish years there will be a few hybrid cars starting around 25k. Honda is already making one
[7:34:29] 07biby: a disney imagineer desined the most recent one and it works
[7:34:30] HaxzorJimDuggan: like i care about the next generation
[7:34:37] MackAttack1421: "Back in my day computers sat on a desk" - Towelliee
[7:34:39] rjd33: putting this tech in the hands of stupid people will end bad
[7:34:40] 91Niki: @Auxiliator 25k is still middle class. Not below it.
[7:34:43] MackPlays: These kids live in the net
[7:34:52] Djhawk26: Reality sucks
[7:34:59] ChinoX_L: @auxiliator didn‚Äôt Tesla drop the price of their cars to 30k
[7:35:20] aspiration89: @ChinoX_L No, it's like 34k and it's "after probable savings"
[7:35:38] ChinoX_L: sh ok
[7:35:38] MackAttack1421: I still don't get how all the major car manufactures are saying 2030 for full EV
[7:35:41] YoujustgotFaced: mount inc on rumpapot
[7:35:41] purfessorplum: I'm just holding out for Star Trek Holodeck in my lifetime, I'll live out my days in one of those instead of being abused in a nursing home
[7:35:42] ChinoX_L: ah*
[7:35:45] CousinAvi86: oven* sorry
[7:35:48] MackAttack1421: The infrastructure is lagging so bad
[7:35:48] P_risco: It's not just kids anymore, most people live on the internet LUL
[7:36:00] Arocian: no way
[7:36:06] MackAttack1421: We need better infrastructure
[7:36:06] Moobot: https://twitter.com/towelthetank/status/1743035635030691892
[7:36:10] polaropposite76: not a chance in this country
[7:36:11] pbnj_kills: there still isnt a solid infrastructure for ev
[7:36:13] Arocian: Not full EV
[7:36:25] Vesidian: chance at love rocket, 1 per day/toon?
[7:36:26] expbottles: used car market will skyrocket
[7:36:33] purfessorplum: We need better battery tech
[7:36:35] Nyytro84: the batteries need better tech for mass production
[7:36:36] XLcoj: Whats gonna happen when u gotta change your car battery for 20k?
[7:36:36] pbnj_kills: they skipped the hybrid step basically and went straight to ev
[7:36:38] sauce_hammer: charging time is absurd
[7:36:39] LilChiliMPH: i see a few  trying to get into hydrogen engines now
[7:36:46] rjd33: EVs will be dominant when they get fast charging
[7:36:52] Sollice: Hydrogen engines are old
[7:36:54] pryse__: Cali passed a law that 2030 there will no longer be a sell of non electric cars
[7:36:55] martzerarh: yeah, but oil companies are deep into the government and lobbying
[7:36:58] Sollice: They aren't new tech
[7:37:00] DrnknMnky79: Hybrids are starting to be more popular than EVs due to the lack of infrastructure.
[7:37:03] HaxzorJimDuggan: need a lot more charging stations before i could even consider an EV
[7:37:09] dwolters_the_zombieman: the problems with ev's is the batteries are toxic and ev's use more electricity and which the electric companies put out more carbon gases than cars and ev's when they start on fire the firefighters can't even put them out and ev's have 80% more problems and way more expensive to repair
[7:37:12] polaropposite76: Hybrid is so much better if you do long range driving but like someone else said we kinda skipped them
[7:37:15] HaxzorJimDuggan: the south is not big on that
[7:37:23] Sollice: @pryse__ That won't ever stick
[7:37:28] Auxiliator: @ChinoX_L Model 3 is mid 30s base
[7:37:33] TheGamingDead: What about that super charging station that went down due to extreme cold temp. Cars had to be towed to Tesla service station.
[7:37:33] PixieFirefly: Truth
[7:37:34] Sollice: They said they would have like 40mpg as MINIMUM by 2025 or something
[7:37:35] valianya: @Towelliee one day that guy in the helmet stopping in the street is going to get hit by a car being driven by the other guy in the helmet behind the wheel, and nobody else will notice because everyone else will be watching ads on their neurolink helmets
[7:37:38] Karbonn: There's not enough infrastructure to support everyone on EV's lol.
[7:37:38] Arocian: The charging is the huge unsolved problem. never hear them talk about apartment / condo dwellers. Parking lots with 100's of vehicles and no way to install that many chargers in those lots.
[7:37:40] JoshuaTree6969: no way its possible
[7:37:42] rjd33: fantasy and reality are two different things
[7:37:43] Heero_Effect: cali and Texas are so similar being opposites
[7:37:43] Raddius: PGE&E and SoCal Edison are going to destory us the more EV's on the road.  They already asking for another rate increase.
[7:37:46] pryse__: True, we will see if it sticks
[7:37:51] MackAttack1421: @dwolters_the_zombieman The gov'ts are saying they will use more green energy to support it
[7:37:53] Z_Shontonga: Cali will redact that...if for no other reason, the fact that the electric grid can't handle the current supply of power is a HUGE problem.
[7:37:57] HaxzorJimDuggan: gonna be dealerships lined up on the border
[7:37:57] MackAttack1421: Like Wind and Solar
[7:38:01] MackPlays: All the electric cars parked next to the homless camps
[7:38:06] 91Niki: They started making zones here were certain cars can't drive. Like a big zone around copenhagen you can't drive diesel cars without a certain filter on it. You will get a nasty ticket if you attempt it
[7:38:10] dwolters_the_zombieman: manufactures have stopped with ev productions and going to hybrids
[7:38:17] sauce_hammer: power went out last night from bad storms in cali
[7:38:34] Djhawk26: Electric stang
[7:38:45] fistofnature: only thing i dont like about EV cars is how they feel during winter, dont like losing up to 60% of the max drive capacity just because its cold outside
[7:38:57] CousinAvi86: Delorean posted a concept for an electric sports car and it looks sick. Gull wing doors and all.
[7:39:02] JoshuaTree6969: theres no resale market for EV's so theres a lot of uncertainty moving forward
[7:39:09] PigPenLen: later dude towHAMUP
[7:39:12] ambiotic: towHAMUP towHAMUP

[7:39:23] MackPlays: no clue

[7:39:25] pryse__: towHAMUP towHAMUP towHAMUP towHAMUP
[7:39:27] JoshuaTree6969: towBleedpurple towBleedpurple towBleedpurple
[7:39:47] Cafe0le: you dont want to the wednesday one, right ? need to save that lockout for after p2 launches
[7:39:58] valianya: 1.21 gigawatts of Delorean EV?
[7:40:08] dannyis1337: no reset they confirmed
[7:40:12] HaxzorJimDuggan: if you do wednesday you will be saved to saturday unless they decide to reset it
[7:40:15] dannyis1337: save for thursday
[7:40:22] SamuraiWillZ916: you can run it tomorrow and it will be reset on wed....
[7:40:29] dwolters_the_zombieman: @MackAttack1421 that still doesn't deal with how toxic they are because of the batteries and how awful they are in cold and are you a rich person to repair ev's average consumers couldn't afford it
