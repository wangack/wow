[2:38:30] Feon2P: @Alleleirauh  what kind of stupid ? the superficial things time related and likes ?
[2:38:46] StreamFollower: @julliant The last anime I watched was Campfire Cooking because the LN is solid. okey Before that was Konosuba, because I basically don't watch anime. AoT doesn't sound like a good time with that in mind.
[2:38:49] julliant: nyr764 Yeou will also be completely free afaik, passion project by devs.

[2:40:19] Feon2P: @Alleleirauh  people will never be happy the way it ends , like game of thrones LUL cause people alread chose sides before the end
[2:40:29] StreamFollower: @Awe_Roar_Ra All I say to that is lol. okey But glad you enjoyed it.
[2:40:34] julliant: AoT is mecha anime in disguise okey but very good characters and writing
[2:40:41] Alleleirauh: @Feon2P nah GoT was ruined by idiotic writing, nothing to do with sides

[8:12:23] Omnillect: Str, int, fuck them, even more useless than spirit. Spirit still kinda useless though. Agi > spirit in like 5 to 1 ez.
[8:12:28] DonPigeon: okey
[8:12:28] issacar42: its an interesting point, I never considered spirit in the context of leveling, but it's actually a pretty nice thing to have for sustain, esp. in classic
[8:12:36] yusba: how spirit works for mana regen is kinda wack in wow unless youre a priest with talents. thats all i know
[8:12:41] Zhyren: people are so focused on raiding everything they say generally revolves around it. Even if it's not the context
[8:12:43] DieseMarkise: @singsing most people have that opinion because spirit ramps up exponentially; so if you dont have a LOT of spirit, the effectiveness is quite low in comparison to str/int. in combination with you just having the ability to drink, it makes a lot of people just kind of discard it
[8:12:51] ivanUE_: where birb pet?
[8:12:59] Ji04: xdding
[8:13:06] itsjustanotherid: I think you get aspect of the Viper soon, helps regen. I would invest in other stats
[8:13:12] gegepege: doge OkayChamp
[8:13:12] Reticent_88: Spirit doesn't ramp, it's static
[8:13:13] issacar42: @DieseMarkise that's not really true, you technically only need enough spirit to sustain
[8:13:19] majinryumenace: Yeah I remember hunters going, AGI>STR>Everything else at least on end game
[8:13:25] Waterfallllll: you got this sing, easy

[8:14:04] Myliak: @singsing this is stat priority for leveling on classic Agility = Spirit > Stamina = Intellect > Strength
[8:14:09] ygg_druid: grolsopol
[8:14:14] chicke___: yes, that is literally what is happening
[8:14:17] Myliak: based on wowhead

[8:14:24] SnowballEOD: YUP
[8:14:24] DieseMarkise: @singsing it is 1% of the previous regen; so that's why it's exponential.

[8:14:40] w0mbii: imagine building a char yourself and having fun instead of following some nerd's build online smhmyhead
[8:14:45] SnowballEOD: WOWHEAD says spirit bad AAAA
[8:14:48] Peridotine: applying endgame stats to leveling is apples to oranges, incomparable

[8:15:00] Myliak: wtf? wowhead says spirit good, what are you looking at?
[8:15:02] LetMeDieFirst: @singsing isnt linear would be like +5 mana/sec etc. and +1% is exponential?  never played wow so no idea about the actual discussion tho
[8:15:04] Exile_truth: Exile_truth subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 24 months! 
[8:15:05] Myliak: this is formula from wowhead Agility = Spirit > Stamina = Intellect > Strength

[11:36:40] Rkzuuu: @digimon4k playing solo is a lot  harder
[11:36:48] Reticent_88: @SnowballEOD Still 1min CD in TBC, it was Wrath they made it good
[11:36:57] SnowballEOD: I think his pet skill bar is out of order so it never has enough Focus for growl
[11:37:06] DuKeIt0uT: TBC pet will be and forever be ravager
[11:37:18] Reticent_88: @SnowballEOD I remember camping the white gorilla in Un'Goro at the start of Wrath to use as an AoE tank
[11:37:35] SnowballEOD: TBC was when I started hunter and man it's hard going back to classic. Mend pet feels so weak and my pet is not nearly tanky enough Sadge
[11:37:39] Reticent_88: @DuKeIt0uT For leveling, 100%. For raids, Wind Serpent > Ravager

[11:39:12] theoccAZN: selling nudes?
[11:39:24] SnowballEOD: But I do think his pet skills are why he is losing threat, pet is spending all focus on dps skills and misses some growl procs because of it.
[11:39:29] Kafka0001: your dog is stronger than tiger, impressive
[11:39:58] roflnaldo: @SnowballEOD If he turns off claw the problem is solved
[11:40:09] Slaymeh: illegal goldthorn?
[11:40:10] roflnaldo: Pet regenerates just enough for bite and growl on cd
[11:40:12] SnowballEOD: @roflnaldo Yeah it is such a focus eating skill
[11:40:24] DuKeIt0uT: Honestly you only need one growl per mob, if it gets worse then intimidate so I disagree
[11:40:24] DuckWeed23: worlds first Pog
[11:40:58] Reticent_88: @roflnaldo Why bait? It has highest DPS on bosses because of ignoring armor. Only downside is eating up Stormstrike debuffs if you also have an Ele Shaman
[11:41:25] SeaSamID: tame the tiger
[11:41:29] SnowballEOD: @DuKeIt0uT sometimes yes, sometimes no. some tanky mobs just take long enough to kill that pet can't hold them. It's usually fine, just risky in HC
[11:41:39] roflnaldo: @Reticent_88 Good luck making it have good uptime on its melee during boss movement or on pull
