[1:07:01] abracka_: throw it in the vault every other   week, or just a  quest turn in
[1:07:07] Hymirx: what, i thought we could just farm it in 16+ m+ dungeons
[1:07:36] abracka_: if it's the start of legion we're fucked

[1:09:10] indigooo: gettint 200+ chaos for a weapon if you dont go to dungeons is hard
[1:09:22] Skylin3r: you'd still need to farm the primal chaos though
[1:09:31] visaeris412: still no mention of primal chaos being account bound, that should be the minimum IMO

[1:10:32] Aegllor: I have more than I need on my main but I can’t get enough on my alts

[1:10:57] mavericks312: my main is sitting on damn near 1k chaos
[1:11:12] reggiepowa: even in final fantasy you have to farm gear
[1:11:24] visaeris412: if not they should definitely increase acquisition in WQ and lower mythich dungeons

[1:19:41] ArcaneMaki: I worked at Ubisoft for 8 years and it is exactly like that. If your entire team performs well, management still needs to force poor evaluation  on performing employees.

[1:22:07] SilkeySmooth: its work its not worth losing your job for imo i would have rated low
[1:22:10] thebakeriscomingforu: using that analogy companies hate it when all team members end up in S tier because raises have to be higher.

[1:23:49] Kanrad: nah man, they only had a few people that could still access the game at that point due to goverment regulations

[1:25:23] Rudric_Ice: can chinese players do that ?
[1:25:24] reggiepowa: if they have the will to start everything from 0 again
[1:25:25] Alienfromger: where is the chinese copy of wow anyway?
[1:25:29] BoezIRL: can they?
[1:25:36] DallTV_: warcraft mobile game hehe
[1:25:39] altair19992: dude warlocks pissed
[1:25:39] Shaele: china has a semi-closed net, the ymay not be able to use other realms @Towelliee
[1:25:41] WasomeWasTaken: pls tell me frost DK got some buffs
[1:25:46] abracka_: in pvp
[1:25:50] altair19992: its the biggest nerf in wow history to a single spell
[1:25:53] BoezIRL: pvp
[1:25:55] reggiepowa: @BoezIRL they can, bunch of them are already playing on na servers with vpns
[1:25:57] Bawpears: Soulkeeper didn't need to be nerfed 90%
[1:26:03] SilkeySmooth: unnerfed by 25%
[1:26:10] OGTweeter: No more double tap for hunters is huge
[1:26:13] aero3132: I had a chinese tank the other day in NA
[1:26:30] medanmarko: @WasomeWasTaken To me this is a clear example of money speaks. Apparently, immoral is the only things thats profitable so it remains and is spared. If other products were raking in enough cash, these companies would find a way to continue.

[1:27:12] Revelations45: this looks good for Grand Theft Auto
[1:27:20] akia03: some of the chinese rwf guilds went to na server npw
[1:27:50] WasomeWasTaken: @WasomeWasTaken it literally falls under a different license than the other games so it can remain under the current agreement they have... gotta see what happens when that one expires
[1:27:53] SSD511_: I see a lot of Chinese guilds in my server with SUI addons
[1:27:56] neverbornlucky: warlocks got nerfed right ?
[1:28:15] Obmxtiny: blocker? LUL
[1:28:38] Rudric_Ice: why all chinese players on illidan ?
[1:29:12] WasomeWasTaken: @WasomeWasTaken could be that the games didnt make enough money to be profitable against chineese license prices... so the question is, how much were the chinese wanting to see?

[1:40:25] RaginCajun05: the focus's tp need to be account bound
[1:40:33] dutchie76: too soon for uncapped valor i guess?
[1:40:35] ClassicMalcontent: @brydeen45 so many things should be account wide and account bound
[1:40:45] thebakeriscomingforu: I made the frostfire plate belt last night.
[1:40:45] TitanKross: lvling an alliance evoker for m+. i hope you put that in the universe
[1:40:52] WasomeWasTaken: having them account bound sounds broken
[1:41:04] Skylin3r: sparks will never be account bound
[1:41:21] ohnostepbarb: I have 70 concentrated primals. It’d be nice if they were account bound
[1:41:25] reggiepowa: gearing is main gameplay loop, if its too easy then what are you even doing on alts
[1:41:27] maipatat: @TITANCR0SS for heals or dps?
[1:41:31] flyingmachin3: they just need the shard machine so you can get your spark back
[1:41:34] ClassicMalcontent: @Skylin3r of course they wont but they should be. Tired of these single character limitations
[1:41:43] dutchie76: @ohnostepbarb can i borrow like 8?

[1:42:09] dutchie76: halls of confusion
[1:42:24] wraaith: is legion timewalkin m+ in or out ( callender says in )
[1:42:38] shale93: sparks are fine but running 50x 16 m+ on each alt is KEKW

[1:42:50] jkitchin75: @Skylin3r it should

[1:43:30] WasomeWasTaken: this gauntlet sucks
[1:43:40] ClassicMalcontent: @Skylin3r no it is not in fact saying that. As a separate thought on that line of thinking, if personal loot were restored for Normal and RF/GF making loot AB not SB would be fine as well.

[2:25:10] mavericks312: i also hear youtube demonetizes ppl for some of the dumbest shit to
[2:25:18] canniik: Have the tiktok streamers asked people to join the live to see if they blink? Thats money right there KEKW
[2:25:18] Rudric_Ice: ads pays yer bills
[2:25:19] Heero_Effect: I think if you have a big following already YouTube could work.

[2:26:22] defunked: I remember when MoonMoon told us about his new contract and being forced to play ads, he was very emotional about you can hear his voice crack from holding back tears
[2:26:22] PyromooseTV: just stop watching streamers? vote with your time
[2:26:24] Oegn_: its just good money and people need to aknowledge everyone needs money to live

[3:10:54] PvtHudson093: i heard they give back pain
[3:10:55] Greencaps07: lmao spending that much money for ppl not use them for more than 30mins
[3:11:01] buzzerktv: love my SL, 46$ a month = GG
[3:11:03] BoogieDuck: Is DX racer still a thing?

[3:11:13] jess_sing0801: their chairs hurt after about 3 months
[3:11:25] Mamma_Nel: towelliee gets it, herman miller office chair >>>> any gaming chair rn
[3:11:34] coldarmorTBG: Yeah I work from home and am an avid gamer.. Right now I have a $70 gaming chair from Amazon... By the end of the day my ass and back feel like I sat in a cheap chair all day lol...
[3:11:37] abracka_: all aboard the copium train for servers coming up early towCopium towCopium train departs in roughly 10 minutes
[3:11:39] Molvonos: FYI: You can get Secret Labs Chairs on Amazon and do the payment plan instead of the full payout.
[3:11:43] PvtHudson093: And the titan xl is greta for tall people
[3:11:47] Molvonos: There is no interest, so you're legit just paying for cost.
[3:11:48] faulen: 3 things to never go cheep on...Office Chair, Mattress, and Shoes. You will never regret your purchase.
[3:11:52] DeathWarrant21: the "gaming" chairs never last. Office chairs are miles better than a gaming chair
[3:11:59] Hammerpain: @beerking2323 - yea same here
[3:12:04] Skylin3r: what about noblechairs?
[3:12:08] buzzerktv: SL does for sure
[3:12:08] Molvonos: Nah, its not affirm
[3:12:16] justateapot: @faulen 100% agree!
[3:12:18] Molvonos: Its just 'Pay the full amount but over time' with no interest
[3:12:18] theDirtyon3: Affirm is how I got my secret labs chair
[3:12:19] Lloyder47: My home is my office and i'm tempted to get a herman miller and write it off on my taxes
[3:12:19] piffe: If you break a secret lab chair.. I'm wondering wth you are doing in it.
[3:12:22] vallersia: I sit like a gremlin in my chair so that doesn’t help. Legs crossed all the time. My feet hang cause I’m 5ft though
[3:12:23] NobodybetterPat: you can do the payment plan from their website as well
[3:12:24] abracka_: you can also generate a virtual card with affirm and use it even if a site doesn't offer it as payment
[3:12:24] g0n_z3n: Yeah pretty much. I get a lot of music studio gear that way
[3:12:35] citrinesoan: towBlind woah
[3:12:43] Lloyder47: Yeah read an article about the buy now pay later trend in the youngens

[3:13:37] Molvonos: I paid cash for mine and built it myself, lol.
[3:13:38] Heero_Effect: Origin PC has some nice builds.
[3:13:44] Molvonos: Best 3k i've ever spent
[3:13:53] IronWishfull: origin does have good customer support , i returned mine 3 times then got a refund and it was all pretty stress free
[3:14:04] Quikbeard: Bought a PC from Digitalstorm 4-5 years ago. Was the easiest thing I’ve ever done regarding pc upgrading and payments. I’m going with Origin this time around
[3:14:07] MosesPoe: future proofing a prebuilt is almost impossible, they don't WANT you future proofed, they want more money from you soon
[3:14:07] gfield2k: WoW the servers going to be down for a minute
[3:14:09] PvtHudson093: he knows
[3:14:12] citrinesoan: brb
[3:14:16] g0n_z3n: @Lloyder47 Yeah but that's not really any different than a credit card. It's just the new version of blowing up credit cards :p
[3:14:23] geokouts: it will be 8h for EU tomorrow
[3:14:25] id_invaded__: Small patch barely anything 8 hours is ridiculous
[3:14:29] doombawks: I was just coming to ask if the patch was live and I just can't see it
[3:14:48] MosesPoe: yea, but what about the rest of the PC
[3:14:50] PvtHudson093: Crysis
[3:14:56] MosesPoe: and you pay double
[3:14:59] Screamnsteam: i got a 7900xt and its been great for WoW LUL

[3:15:14] LX2_EXE: Lol decent processor and video card is all you need
[3:15:17] PvtHudson093: rip evga
[3:15:19] Foxdoabarrelrofl: this man doesnt play ubisoft games lol
[3:15:22] XFaunii: you could literally have a 3060 and be fine for years, people are still using 1060s and older cards LuL
[3:15:24] Greencaps07: minecraft ray tracing
[3:15:26] LX2_EXE: 32 gb of ram is even overkill
[3:15:30] c0mmander_starscream: Crysis 2077
[3:15:32] Scarhearth: I mean Crysis in general LUL
[3:15:32] flubbachubb: evga cards >>>
[3:15:33] doombawks: Idk man, Ark: Survival Evolved on ultra-high settings is pretty heavy
[3:15:34] BestoftheWurst: on secret lab chairs... what do you prefer "leather" or fabric?
[3:15:40] coldarmorTBG: but will it run Crysis??
[3:15:42] Molvonos: @Greencaps07 I should time you out for that, lmao
[3:15:43] Everit: @Towelliee your FPS is really good! do you play wow on the highest ultra settings?
[3:15:43] HonestPhilosophy: I just got a 7900 xtx, wows never looked better lol

[3:16:00] beerandwaffles: Should you really be buying a pc if you getting a payment plan for 2k?
[3:16:02] MosesPoe: I guess it's not so much about what's gonna get throttled, then it is that I don't want to pay someone an extra 600 bucks or more to do something I can do m7yself, build it
[3:16:05] geokouts: WoW on max 10
[3:16:10] gfield2k: That's true Towelliee. My PC guys said the same thing. When I got my 2080ti an my 4090.
[3:16:13] Attackroot: playing ark on ultra in pve or pvp serser? cause in pvp thats just dumb
[3:16:16] eakiller: I did 8 years with my 970 and its only now that I can't play the latest games
[3:16:18] LX2_EXE: People acting like they are creating animated movies for Disney with their PC
[3:16:26] InceptionGod: i wouldn't use Ark as a baseline either because the game's engine is already heavy. if you have everything dl'd its like 450g
[3:16:27] Whitemamba236: this quest is so buggy
[3:16:29] dreamwalker213: I’m on a tight budget after getting a new car but need some minor upgrades to my pc to fix some fps issues in like major cities and raids. Any opinions on what’s most important to replace?

[3:16:59] geokouts: watch the highlight feature
[3:17:13] MosesPoe: I find the pricing on prebuilt and having a pc built from parts you purchased, to be ridiciulous for the work required
[3:17:13] Everit: @Towelliee what graphic settings do you play wow on?
[3:17:15] Molvonos: Yea, Wrathion's the legendary snap of this course.

[3:47:42] izzlarn65: nah I think return to pandaland is next
[3:47:48] DoughBoi_Trev: @dionaut you forget about the whole chromie questline and Nzoth? in the black kingdom? The eye wasn't speaking to chromie and the other drake, he was talking to you when he was saying WAIT I know you
[3:47:50] reggiepowa: this expansion or this patch
[3:47:54] Dionaut: Maybe the primalist are just mad. But feels like there gonna rage and brake something very important. That will lead to the next fight or invasion

[3:50:46] Bernardo994: I do wish they would have kept the tree and undercity destroyed
[3:50:51] cabalish: its down
[3:50:53] Hylilan: no its right next to the quest for all the red dragonflight keepers
[3:51:12] DoughBoi_Trev: I'm convinced the Primalists are tools of Nzoth at this point from what we have seen so far.
[3:51:19] Molvonos: Now lets see if this works.
[3:51:34] Molvonos: Primalists are just Twilight's Hammer 2.0.
[3:51:49] TheBakerDee: Is the big patch today?
[3:51:52] looney199725: @DoughBoi_Trev there older than that according to what we are told
[3:52:04] DoughBoi_Trev: @towelliee the Neltharion cinematic, then the Chromie questline with the eye speaking to US saying wait I know you
[3:52:20] james_bah: how did rasza escape that void thing she got pulledi n
[3:52:24] DoughBoi_Trev: etc, then nzoth isn't dead
[3:53:07] MosesPoe: cause and effect?
[3:53:09] Ch0p_Su3y: infinite dragonflight bring old bosses for a raid.. or even corrupt versions of the aspects
[3:53:13] LX2_EXE: Primalists were mearly a setback
[3:53:18] DoughBoi_Trev: but Sargeras Star in Azeroth is brighter and bigger than ever
[3:53:23] Molvonos: The Infinite Dragonflight, like the Black Dragonflight, are inherently Old God corrupted, but they're not linked to the Primalists as of current
[3:53:26] wattage_ohm: chromie is evil and broke time
[3:53:30] MosesPoe: Cause, we saved Chromie from a time slip, effect, the Primals were created
[3:53:35] Sylphy_TV: towTinfoil towCopium

[3:54:37] reggiepowa: chromie becomes that dragon she was fighting
[3:54:37] macmittens808: Nyalotha actually being a dream nzoth gave us would be way too good of writing for wow
[3:54:41] TheNightfyre: Primalist Hogger
[3:55:12] pavepawns: i hate the idea of nzoth being alive
[3:55:15] pavepawns: its too annoying
[3:55:15] reggiepowa: it kinda would be shit
[3:55:20] Shaele: If they bring up old gods one more time, i'm gonna go ballistic
[3:55:23] MosesPoe: @pigzip he'll talk about it scewing off into a tangent universe, similar to ours, but DIFFERENT
[3:55:29] stephens0197: I skipped the whole story LUL
[3:55:32] Dionaut: The primalist are going to do something, that will weaken that aspects. So Nozdormu will have to sacrafice himself to save the rest. Which brings forth Murozond
[3:55:33] BigDiezel: @Towelliee thats cause people hate ex machina endings
[3:55:44] pavepawns: keep nzoth dead and ressurectr ysharj

[4:40:00] REALPolarbeezy: Some place north i think.
[4:40:01] TompsonX: Either Tyrhold or Valdraken lol
[4:40:04] DarthWrex: Valdrakken at the top of the tower
[4:40:04] Foretoldlegends: Seems like Valdrakken.
[4:40:05] TompsonX: nothing to ponder
[4:40:17] iccyc0ld: That’s too easy
[4:40:27] ijuki: Shift + J and pick the correct quest

[4:41:06] Sollice: I dont think you can turn crafted items in to set pieces?

[4:41:11] cabalish: @zuvic no
[4:41:14] TompsonX: Kappa
[4:41:21] DuhCasual: Healers get beat up in the first season, do you think that bliz has over done it this season? The healing checks are too much and in lower keys 8-12 DPS can't keep up to the dps requirements not manage the mechs

[4:42:23] Scrimshank1961: you can use drops from m+, raid, pvp, or the epic items from the elemental storms
[4:42:23] barrowzz: rated pvp, m+ and raid gear you can turn into tier.. maybe m0 and world quest? f idk the first few though i mentioned can use in catalyst for sure  @Scrimshank1961
[4:42:23] iccyc0ld: @gghote 8-12s hard?
[4:42:39] Daddynoots: @iccyc0ld Lol, found the fellow networking nerd.
[4:42:54] GingerGambit: With how the story is kinda going, do you think they are going to corrupt Tyr’s body and turn it into a primal it’s boss?
[4:42:58] DuhCasual: @iccyc0ld brutal in pugs yup
[4:42:59] inj0shwetrust: Crafted gear is its own tier with embellishments though
[4:43:05] Daddynoots: @iccyc0ld You figure out a fix for Layer 8 issues, let me know lol.
[4:43:06] iccyc0ld: @daddynoots don’t tell anyone LUL
[4:43:12] GodKingMuninn: makes crafted gear even less valuable :( would be so cool to turn flaring cowl into tier that retains the effect

[4:53:47] neverbornlucky: I took a nice back pain med and fell asleep . Was hoping to wake up after patch was up
[4:53:51] Foretoldlegends: @Uglyfoot You can do a minimum of ten people on any difficulty. It's a flex raid meaning the amount of loot dropping is based on raid size.
[4:54:00] Scrimshank1961: goin against the grain there huh @zerihikaru
[4:54:07] SilkeySmooth: a 10 man option would be less gear ivl then m+
[4:54:27] Uglyfoot: @Foretoldlegends Mythic raid is 20 man only
[4:54:31] Lilurrn: @neverbornlucky you know the maintenance is scheduled for 8 hrs right?

[4:55:33] Foretoldlegends: And then there's some people that don't know how to do mechanics.
[4:55:37] MartyrTV1: didnt they try to fix bosses so that the raid is cleared b4 the holiday
[4:55:41] MartyrTV1: instead of natural prog
[4:55:44] Lilurrn: @bloodyreapr Did you guys not read the battle launcher message?
[4:55:45] snake_like: still remember going from 40 to 25 and people flipping out that they wouldn't get a free raid spot anymore
[4:55:49] zodd_amhai: for people who say why just dont play it wth

[4:56:10] Dr3aMsPeC: NA SERVERS ARE DOWN. HOW IS TOWELLIEE PLAYING?
[4:56:13] skymercii: @Lilurrn no because ive been sick all last week with a sinus infection
[4:56:37] MartyrTV1: u cant u are not 70 🤓
[4:56:37] cptrogers123: Is it weird that i kinda miss shadowlands? @Towelliee
[4:56:38] snake_like: caps lock is cruise control for cool EZ
[4:56:42] hammack52: you on EU or the PTR
[4:56:47] Zansteh: did 10 man and some bosses dropped only a piece of loot
[4:56:51] crocadopolis: 10 man mythic would be so fun
[4:56:52] potatolisk: give us diablo 4 !!
[4:56:53] NotEnoughMana: LUL
[4:56:58] PvtHudson093: I miss BFA
[4:56:59] Foretoldlegends: And I get groups that still go 70% right because they don't know to meet by the markers...
[4:57:01] flebbooo: KEKW
[4:57:02] SilkeySmooth: shadowladns had moreto do then DF
[4:57:04] MapenEG: I miss bfa dungeons
[4:57:05] zerihikaru: atleast we can start downloading the patch :3
[4:57:06] Heero_Effect: My guild does 10 man…not by choice…just most of the guild didn’t return
[4:57:09] naznarens: @Dr3aMsPeC he is on EU bruv
[4:57:09] neverbornlucky: I miss shadowlands too Towelliee
[4:57:11] wEiRdO_dUdE: I'm sure some people miss the Maw LUL
[4:57:19] Scarhearth: @PvtHudson093 I miss corruption. Only thing i miss from BFA
[4:57:22] snake_like: the transmog is way better in shadowlands IMO, even the 9.0 stuff alone
[4:57:31] crocadopolis: That would be fine, you have less ppl u get less loot
[4:57:33] pbnj_kills: with a 10 man, 7/10 spots would be taken with raid buffs
[4:57:53] Sayryn: I would be fine with less loot, but what sucked back in the day was when 20 was better ilevel than 10 man.
[4:57:55] captain_khyzan: issue with 10man is less people = easier mythic runs (less people to screw up) so 10man would be the meta
[4:57:59] cptrogers123: there were more to do in shadowlands tbh
[4:58:00] PvtHudson093: Corruption, essences and legendary cloak and Neck
[4:58:13] Lilurrn: the problem with a fight like rasz where you need cds for all the overlaps and with 10m theres not enough cds to mitigate gmd
[4:58:24] crocadopolis: I think more people would get into Mythic raiding if 10 man was a thing.
[4:58:32] Foretoldlegends: @captain_khyzan Not always true. If someone dies to early, it can mess up a lot of a fight, depending on who dies.
[4:58:33] Lilurrn: dmg*
[4:58:34] squishalan: Just get rid of 20 man make it only 10
[4:58:42] Tooyoo: I mean a lot of the difficulty of 20 vs 10man has to do with finding 20 ppl vs 10. I feel like raiding is 90% people managment, 10% playing the game.
[4:58:44] wEiRdO_dUdE: True, it's harder to cover the utility you need with just 10 people
[4:58:52] celic298: Yooo when will NA severs be up ?
[4:59:05] squishalan: Fuck 20 man mythic
[4:59:06] faulen: Id say make it 25 man mythic before 10 man.
[4:59:08] Raxxiety: today sometime
[4:59:15] baZleicious: @celic298 seriously. this guy
[4:59:24] crocadopolis: My frames are so much better with less ppl tho LOL
[4:59:25] kimmo_gaming: you are versatile with 20 and there is much to coordinate and thats good
[4:59:26] tommysavagex: mythic would be more accessible at 10 man
[4:59:27] Lilurrn: according to the launcher 3pm pst
[4:59:28] tommysavagex: more people would do it
[4:59:35] M00ST00S: solo mythic raid for the win!
[4:59:37] Heero_Effect: They should it make it one player mythic
[4:59:37] hammack52: i want 40 man mythic
[4:59:38] Quikbeard: 10 man heroic raiding was the most goated shit ever and forced many guilds to break up
[4:59:41] Allvarez: raiding has always been people management centered
[4:59:42] captain_khyzan: @Foretoldlegends def a big reason. its why 40man raids dont exist as much in any game anymore to hard to many people with little more reward
[4:59:44] NVbrutal: 30m Mythic lets go
[4:59:47] Squid1030: Will someone think of the frames!
[4:59:47] squishalan: I think make mythic only for achieves also no better loot than heroic
[4:59:48] baZleicious: mythic isn't made to be accessible
[4:59:48] M00ST00S: too many shitters out there! lmao
[4:59:52] bucsarge: bring back 40 mans
[5:00:01] Putcride: It would be cool if blizz made a raid with only five people
[5:00:05] Moobot: No need to repeat yourself, @thecbone25 (warning)
[5:00:07] Zendero89: imagine the fps in 40man raid..
[5:00:11] wEiRdO_dUdE: Spreadsheets, yep
[5:00:15] Bayne77: no raid should be below 40 man
[5:00:17] zeiours: I want 100 man mythic
[5:00:19] Prism_Gavin: I think it iis unfair to say raiding is only 10% play, especially with mythic-level raiding. I mean look at how long it took for world first, that took so much coordination and hard work.
[5:00:22] xylez: 100man mythic each boss drops the whole loot table :)
[5:00:27] Foretoldlegends: @captain_khyzan But if you can give at least ten pieces of loot for a 40 man kill, it'd make 40 mans worth it again, especially with LFG being so accessable.
[5:00:27] Autoexeq: Halondrus 40man mythic NotLikeThis
[5:00:31] snake_like: some of yall probably get wet paint on your hands and clothes a lot, huh?
[5:00:37] tommysavagex: I mean, people want to do the hardest content with their friends, 20 people is too many for a lot of guilds
[5:00:41] skymercii: no thank you
[5:00:42] NotEnoughMana: WutFace
[5:00:42] Wcvechten: Sylvanas bridge with 40 people
[5:00:43] flebbooo: i can imagine, my pc would die LUL
[5:00:46] Lilurrn: if everyone wants smaller grp content then isnt that what M+ is for?
[5:00:50] zodd_amhai: zodd_amhai subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 11 months! 11 years
[5:00:50] Bernardo994: imagine you topless
[5:00:52] Sayryn: Give me solo mythic. Like Mage towers that give good gear.
[5:00:53] GingerGambit: 40 man imposter phase XD
[5:00:53] Sylphy_TV: Immagine having FPS
[5:00:58] glitchedem: glitchedem subscribed with Prime. 
[5:01:01] grizzlyhorn: im imagining it but my graphics card is asking me to stop imagining it
[5:01:04] d1stract10n: syilvanis 40 people with all the arrows
[5:01:11] Bayne77: talk about turning down all effects all the way
[5:01:21] irowed: i think solo raids w/ npc's helping mechanics would be awesome
[5:01:24] pbnj_kills: so make a guild and recruit like minded people to hit 20
[5:01:35] hammack52: i think the way it is now is the best way
[5:01:38] Bus136: They could do make mythic 10 man but only get 415ilvl for all bosses
[5:01:40] gritbarontv: i want Mythic LFR, lol
[5:01:43] Foretoldlegends: Imagine Razsageth with 40 people spreading the orbs about.
[5:01:48] Aalee: I had fun doing 40's in classic but only being a couple peices of loot sucked.
[5:01:51] tommysavagex: I guess best decision is to poll the community and see how the feel but I doubt it matters, 20 m seems locked in
[5:01:52] Natfef: we used to have 72 man raids in everquest, shit was wild
[5:01:56] Tooyoo: Yup, every argument for "smaller group sizes" is just people wanting to play an MMO with less people.
[5:01:56] WTHeckman: Why do people act like this all wasnt already argued about in cata. It was pewpy seeing 10 people get world first.
[5:02:11] derry10: there is a few thing that changed with Brewmaster that helps with survivability
[5:02:14] Prism_Gavin: We already complain about things coming out unpolished... Adding in more things for each tier sounds like a recipe for disaster
[5:02:15] beauds69: m+ raid when
[5:02:20] bucsarge: does anybody remember how molten core raids used to be

[5:02:20] gritbarontv: lol
[5:02:22] faulen: Lets make it 25 man. That would give the opportunity for class stacking.
[5:02:22] dreadsacc: is this the  PTR?
[5:02:32] iiTornTunaii: I think the issue is that there are A LOT of dead servers.  They need to allow cross realm from the start
[5:02:35] FrankTizzle: @beauds69 That was Shadowlands Season 4
[5:02:42] iiTornTunaii: to allow for easier mythic groups to form
[5:02:43] TialePetit: @dreadsacc ptr is down now.
[5:02:44] falldrgn: OR.. top guilds would do 10M splits to get gear
[5:02:50] irowed: that action figure case looks so cool
[5:02:52] M00ST00S: @Towelliee what have you developed?
[5:02:53] Heero_Effect: Heroic is “hard” for majority of the player base no?
[5:02:57] Lilurrn: Blizzard has a hard enough time balancing around raids/m+/pvp right now
[5:02:59] Aalee: @bucsarge speedrunning it with full world buffs in classic was a blast
[5:03:03] snake_like: is there a reason Mythic difficulty still locks you to a raid ID? sucks if I miss a raid day and basically can't kill bosses my guild killed earlier
[5:03:06] Autoexeq: People will always do what has lowest effort with highest reward regardless
[5:03:11] Foretoldlegends: How about we stop scaling the mythic gear from the lowest possible number to the highest and just have mythic gear have a flat number so mythic 10 raiders can't complain?
[5:03:16] vallersia: 100% agree with that
[5:03:18] dreadsacc: Then what is this he is playing because the regular servers are down to
[5:03:21] Troniin: also cross faction guilds would be nice
[5:03:30] gwar234: it would be nice to have a slight variance for mythic raiding of group size by maybe 1 or 2 , hitting that 20 all the time is the final boss lol
[5:03:33] hammack52: how did you even get on this topic
[5:03:36] Snabido: Oof KEKW
[5:03:36] Sylphy_TV: LUL
[5:03:38] Molvonos: @Foretoldlegends Even better solution is to keep Mythic 20 man, because it's easier to balance around a set amount of people.
[5:03:41] DuhCasual: Raid gear isn't required to M+? if not then if you want raid gear you raid.
[5:03:45] Plague_GG: Sadge
[5:03:45] Heero_Effect: Like for me heroic is the sweet spot for raiding for me.
[5:03:46] acceptavl3453: @Aalee it took longer to get buffs than the actual raid, thats not fun
[5:03:46] Jango_: @dreadsacc EU
[5:03:46] TialePetit: @dreadsacc there is such thing as EU
[5:03:47] Squats3: @Foretoldlegends the ilvl scales because the difficulty of the bosses goes up as you get further into the raid....wut
[5:03:50] Its_Ange_Here: Are you gonna give bear a try?
[5:03:59] dreadsacc: ah
[5:04:15] irowed: what's bear week?
[5:04:17] LordNebse: is conquest for pvp still capped with the new patch?
[5:04:19] warrenny: @heero_effect Same
[5:04:22] Lilurrn: There is def a wide variety of players in this game. Yesterday I was gearing up an alt and I had a group of full heroic geared toons running heroics just for fun and they were vibing so much having fun
[5:04:22] Kasiiama: one thing i think that sucks, is how difficult rasz is on H (good imo) but my guild being small we couldnt even go to Mythic, had to just keep bashing face in until we finally got AOTC but it did feel good
[5:04:39] dreamwalker213: @lordnebse pretty sure yeah
[5:04:40] MaliciousDH: realm list is already back up
[5:04:40] goodcatboydude: hey towell dude
[5:04:41] stuarfthepally: towOny towOny towOny
[5:04:45] Razznab: i wish i could but now i need 395 ilvl to get into normals haha
[5:04:47] faulen: tier is really good to have
[5:04:52] the_inhumanatee: both my best trinkets are from M+ on my shadow priest and resto druid lol
[5:04:54] Foretoldlegends: @Foretoldlegends It's not that. He's saying that if a mythic 10 got Ilvl 415 gear and a mythic 30 got 427, the mythic 10 people will want the 427 instead of the raid size making them get a 415.
[5:04:58] Molvonos: BiS gear for Vokers are all in the raid, lol
[5:05:00] Squats3: @Towelliee M+ gear is required for mythic raiding though. lol
[5:05:03] grizzlyhorn: i havent done raid once on my warrior and im doing fine
[5:05:05] pbnj_kills: one out of two bis trinkets is from mythic+ at least
[5:05:07] HKsmash: @Kasiiama Thats how it should be, and its the best feeling when it finally clicks
[5:05:09] PapaJackyTV: Sorry for the what I expect is a very common question, but which addon/WA do you use for your m+ timer info etc?
[5:05:11] Lilurrn: raiding was required for m+ for the first 6 weeks but now with catalyst that all changes

[5:06:16] DuhCasual: Raid gears is for raiders. what's the prob? i don't even raid, not mad.
[5:06:17] Sediz: @Lilurrn yeah I done both heroic and even normal dungeons sometimes and gotten grp well geared people... those runs always been insane fast and smooth =D
[5:06:28] khrovaa: worth opening vault as fury on my prot for whetstone even though i could roll a two hand
[5:06:38] Kasiiama: @HKsmash idk its wild that so many people are 2 or 3/8 M and havent even killed Brood or Rasz on H >>
[5:06:39] dreamwalker213: @lilurrn I’d argue it still wasn’t really required, helpful? Sure but not required. I’m doing 17/18s on my holy priest at 395 with 1 raid trinket

[5:07:24] Scrimshank1961: @Foretoldlegends 2400 rating which is about 19s and 20s timed.
[5:07:28] Its_Ange_Here: I think Brew will be a dark horse
[5:07:30] neverbornlucky: I hear frost mage is blizzards favorite step child this month
[5:07:32] pbnj_kills: well blizz doesnt want to shift the meta this late until 10.1
[5:07:36] LoseAlotLuke: how quick to get first catalyst currency then?
[5:07:37] dreamwalker213: @foretoldlegends to fully upgrade a piece to 13/13 you need 2400
[5:07:40] xmedpakx: no more pee breaks in HoV ,, nerfed Skolvalds RP finally
[5:07:41] kreloril777: dps is really good for pali tank, in a group im getting 200k+ dps
[5:07:41] baZleicious: I hope the balance is in a much better place for next raid patch
[5:07:52] wEiRdO_dUdE: #SaveBrewmaster
[5:07:52] aumixp: 2400 rating is 17a
[5:07:53] NattyPally: dorki has brew as second best tank rn

[5:07:59] WundertueteGER: bears surely are better now Clueless
[5:08:05] Razznab: flat damage increases to classes like frost mage dont help the class issues
[5:08:05] mrsbhappy: "balancing" lol
[5:08:07] LoseAlotLuke: once a week is it?
[5:08:30] DuhCasual: world quests count? typically have to do those anyway
[5:08:35] SilkeySmooth: i thought there was no catalyst currency?
[5:08:43] eephuslive: servers not up till 3pst today?
[5:08:43] captn_insano91: just glad I won't have to do it on every alt
[5:08:54] Lilurrn: They opened up a few more points to allocate elsewhere
[5:09:01] TialePetit: ptr went down
[5:09:03] Phewlio: Lol, "don't be weird".  Made me lol
[5:09:05] Red_Dead_Redeem: I mean for me I would kill 2 birds with one stone, due 4 mythic+ for the vault and get my thing for the catalyst
[5:09:07] Scrimshank1961: you can use the epic gear you get from the elemental storms. The 385 stuff
[5:09:11] derry10: brewmaster has more healing sphere generation, and alot of the abilities that were not good to be in because they cost two have been moved to only cost one
[5:09:11] Kasiiama: i think it was just feast/siege/M+/raid and the new event
[5:09:14] George2001k: @towelliee am I the only one who thinks we will get an other catch-up mechanic for rep for our alts at some point?
[5:09:30] Its_Ange_Here: A Bear with ironfur up still has less armor than a prot warrior with less ilvl just existing
[5:09:31] neverbornlucky: towelliee bears in the wild will be op no matter what blizzard does they still kill you when hiking . Go cocaine Bear
[5:09:42] DuhCasual: it'
[5:09:51] Troniin: what's the name of the quest?
[5:10:10] Ledeanna: of course ptr is down they said 10.0.7 will be on ptr shortly after 10.0.5 is deployed
[5:10:19] Lilurrn: How about survival spec has range only spec choices is a real bad design
[5:10:27] DuhCasual: s become tradition for me to spend server day on this channel. great discussion always. gg
[5:10:36] B0MBsz: How does the catalyst work
[5:10:38] RacerDuke: Did you not assign your Dragonriding points, or did you not get all the tokens yet on EU?
[5:10:39] BestoftheWurst: they need to bring other tanks to where warriors are.
[5:10:39] Kelticlore: ptr is down
[5:10:40] DuhCasual: all
[5:10:49] Zayvion: they have more shield time up from the shorter cooldown Celest brew

[5:11:12] DuhCasual: whaaaa?
[5:11:18] HKsmash: I'm cautiously optimistic servers will be up early or on time today
[5:11:41] Lilurrn: how bad was the prot war nerf? big or small?
[5:12:01] dreamwalker213: Small
[5:12:05] baZleicious: @Lilurrn he said "meh"
[5:12:44] Molvonos: They were negligable
[5:14:49] trumptight: @HKsmash same
[5:14:55] Plague_GG: Even if they nerfed warrior survivability by 20% we would just go defensive stance to make up for it

[5:33:29] FutileDiploma: When we thinking servers gonna be up
[5:33:30] N3llee: there are no chinse guilds as of today right?
[5:33:32] Armdel: wowprogress is automated, raider io adds them manually i believe
[5:33:37] Ertra: its gonna take forever to get to cross realm mythic
[5:33:40] CowboyStardust: What would you say to someone thinking about getting into WoW now?
[5:33:59] Ertra: @CowboyStardust DO IT!
[5:34:17] zerihikaru: @cowboystardust  do it I started about a week ago

[5:34:22] akaari5486: Did they fix awful performance in 10.0.5 ?
[5:34:22] Molvonos: @N3llee How was that 1 hour, 48 minutes of Ulduar hype?
[5:34:23] tubbylicious: i feel alot of people are still ok with just getting heroic raids done
[5:34:30] keeb_wtf: we're 4/8 but we didn't prog mythic for a few weeks after release, tried to get everyone their tier pieces first. tier feels "slow" prog wise but for some reason not a lot of urgency
[5:34:37] EdLok_: @Towelliee gave you seen the wow clone they made?
[5:34:39] giggz91: NA up?
[5:34:50] CowboyStardust: @zerihikaru How do you like it. Is it beginner friendly?

[5:37:03] coopergoodingjr: I think it's kind of cool that bosses are pretty tough this time around
[5:37:16] snake_like: most of my raid is between 410 and 415 and we're 5/8. I don't think anything but tuning is going to make the raid easier lol
[5:37:28] xXSiebzehnXx: Double Ravager with Ravager CD being reduced by fury spent
[5:37:40] zerihikaru: @cowboystardust  it's worth a try I came from ffxiv and it was a nice change of pace
[5:37:48] Plague_GG: sweet sweet Azure music
[5:37:50] Ertra: i spend a lot of time in the plains... great for ore/herb farming
[5:37:52] akia03: is this account linked to your na one or a completly seperate one?
[5:37:56] Neuxx: So is this expansion better than shadowlands?
[5:38:05] zerihikaru: @cowboystardust  hardest part is picking a main LUL
[5:38:12] EdLok_: Resto shammy get deserved buffed
[5:38:17] rtsplanner: towBlue

[5:38:48] rtsplanner: rtsplanner subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 9 months, currently on a 7 month streak! towBlue
[5:38:56] Pallyofhell: i havent touched it yet
[5:38:59] mcatx2: Heroic Raz is more difficult than the first 3 mythic bosses. That tel;;s the whole story
[5:39:04] Pallyofhell: i literally refuse to
[5:39:04] BoldrinXX: Oof that vigor
[5:39:05] NVbrutal: yea its pretty bad was in a group last week that took 9 stacks of determ to kill her lol
[5:39:05] Jabables: @Sayryn took about 4 wipes but we got it
[5:39:06] CowboyStardust: @zerihikaru To many cool choices?!?!?
[5:39:08] vexio7: Yes, LFR Raz was a mess
[5:39:09] Uutef: @Sayryn got to 8 stacks before a kill
[5:39:10] abracka_: we honestly just need to get rid of LFR and make normal the baseline if the difficulties aren't going to be that different anymore
[5:39:11] zerihikaru: @sayryn  I did it last night 8 stacks of determination
[5:39:14] FrankTizzle: @Sayryn it's gotten better, people have prepared macros that spam raid warnings because most LFR people don't have DBM
[5:39:15] TheCliffyShow: I did LFR Raz earlier today. Took quite a few tries.
[5:39:16] Yurian33: Streamer server madge
[5:39:18] reggiepowa: they shouldnt, after playing final fantasy story content like normal and alliance raids lfr in wow looks laughable
[5:39:19] snake_like: lfr raz is normal raz without the polarity charges. and the debuff of lfr people
[5:39:19] Neuxx: How come you have a EU and a NA account?
[5:39:20] Heero_Effect: I bet they need raz next month
[5:39:20] FrankTizzle: The first day was awful
[5:39:20] Zansteh: i did it after like 6 queues and last group with 6 det stacks
[5:39:23] Texas_Mizfit: easy nerf for lfr raz get rid of cc orbs
[5:39:24] trx_ice: I got 10 stacks of determ when i did LFR Raz :/
[5:39:25] Heero_Effect: Nerf*
[5:39:26] JimKappa420: I waste 2h we kill this after 16 pulls on my 3rd alt
[5:39:40] FrankTizzle: Do it Kappa
[5:39:40] theDRG: If you can get though phase 1 with the greater majority of the raid alive, its downable. The only other threat is the Thunderous Blast wiping the raid
[5:40:11] zerihikaru: @cowboystardust  yes!
[5:40:12] mcatx2: LFR shouldn't have the enrage. Everything else is fune
[5:40:13] NVbrutal: yea you dont work anything out in lfr lol when people mess up they just start vote kicking
[5:40:18] FrankTizzle: Most LFR rasz groups (especially earlier in the week groups) usually get it down in 7-8 tries
[5:40:19] mcatx2: fine *
[5:40:23] Bayne77: our hardest problem last night was getting assholes to drop the aoe on the edge of the platform
[5:40:24] akaari5486: @Towelliee Is china servers shutdown gonna affect eu/na somehow good or bad >
[5:40:27] meetwad: meaningful choice OMEGALUL
[5:40:27] Shinideakon: i've done it on multiple characters, it wasn't too bad
[5:40:41] minkyawthu: best race for arcane?
[5:40:46] snake_like: LFR Fatescribe didn't really hold anyone's hand either. It was pure cancer
[5:40:49] Shaele: they did not care about lfr clearly, just auto-adjusted numbers and go
[5:41:05] FrankTizzle: racist addon Kappa
[5:41:10] reggiepowa: why would they advertise in chinese
[5:41:18] FrankTizzle: @minkyawthu race doesn't really matter
[5:41:21] zerihikaru: LUL LUL LUL
[5:41:22] LearnedSomething: blockchainese?
[5:41:26] EdLok_: isnt Illidan plagued with chinese already?

[5:41:30] Dionaut: Yea there is gonna be a crazy wave of people selling stuff for real money.
[5:41:36] Heero_Effect: @franktizzle towBlind
[5:41:37] FrankTizzle: @ProgettazioneInferni depends which side
[5:41:53] Foretoldlegends: Why should we need to rely on an addon just to block gold sellers/run sellers/power levelers? Shouldn't Blizzard's automated programs ban them?
[5:42:06] PvtHudson093: the great fire wall of china
[5:42:07] FrankTizzle: @Heero_Effect FeelsOkayMan
[5:42:47] Heero_Effect: Im on korgarth…seems silent all the time
[5:42:48] zerihikaru: @cowboystardust  no idea just started watching this few hours ago
[5:42:54] Kydar: @Foretoldlegends a lot of people are actively having problems with automatic reporting/bans atm. genuine good people. trade-chat mafias based around crafting orders are getting people banned for crafting Lariats for free, for example
[5:42:58] Autoexeq: So if I say "ping pong" in chat I get blocked? Kappa

[5:44:19] Pallyofhell: oh shit mage tower is this week too
[5:44:20] ShookGoBlue: wait what addon do i need to block to coin spammers
[5:44:22] Foretoldlegends: @Foretoldlegends I heard about that. And honestly, this is why we need the old system of in game GMs messaging these players. A lot of uneeded bans and confusion can be patched up.
[5:44:23] chippchappi: the stuttering can be fixed tho. if you google it there is a guide
[5:44:23] TialePetit: @TheOGDaywalker it's a big patch
[5:44:32] Dionaut: It wasnt made by the game. A person made it, to remove the chinies language characters from the chat window. Since most can't understand it.
[5:44:47] KralYoshii: @Towelliee server list is up
[5:44:50] IceMECH: patch day = shower & clean desk day KEKW

[5:50:33] UnrealNightmare: It says in the patch notes the Trading Post is available Feb 1st
[5:50:34] wEiRdO_dUdE: Well, the trading post seems to work on a kind of monthly system, and starting it at the end of the month doesn't give much time, too
[5:50:34] Ertra: you get normal raid loot
[5:50:35] Jadziarai: It's probably because it lines up with montly renewal for subs OMEGALUL
[5:50:35] Stoops21: yepp. monthly rewards
[5:50:37] TialePetit: Since it's a monthly thing, it makes more sense that it comes out on the 1st of the month.. not the 3 weeks in

[6:03:20] iloveyalunn: Was watching Cdew snap yesterday because people kept asking him stuff explained in his title LUL
[6:03:22] thedanishvking: @akia03  like never ? xD we never have that
[6:03:22] Sollice: That sounds like all Havoc. Bad players doing good damage
[6:03:23] furly707: dh is a crutch class imo
[6:03:26] CrunkyBrewster: It really is

[6:03:45] Masqerader: its just people with no clue how to play it, think they know what they're talking about lol
[6:03:47] Dionaut: I dont think you can be bad on havoc. You just hit 3 keys, thats its. Just snack on your paint chips and smash 3 keys to victory xD
[6:03:48] Seawolfrss: face roll class lol

[6:04:22] wEiRdO_dUdE: Yeah, Havoc is not weak even thought it's fairly simple to get into
[6:04:24] kraydom: When you know how to essence break combo it feels sooo good.
[6:04:27] xurem0: DHs low skill floor, but moderate ceiling to get the absolutely best out of it, I think
[6:04:28] snake_like: a good DH is noticed. they're mid otherwise
[6:04:28] firehawk73: wait, we have a 5th button...
[6:04:36] wEiRdO_dUdE: They are still running Havoc in AWC sometimes

[6:05:03] zerihikaru: yeah that's why I asked  any tips for dh dps
[6:05:03] boedy1: i think DH just gets their damage in before the other dps do and thats what makes them look good
[6:05:05] OhNoNotAgain: Vaseline just on the chin?
[6:05:10] snake_like: yeah the 5th button made them apply the vaseline this time
[6:05:12] zerihikaru: don't wanna be a bad dps
[6:05:15] CrunkyBrewster: hell! there's even a Talent for Havok, that just increases your Auto Attacks damage if you choose it LUL
[6:05:20] Doyle501: Do you think arms will take over fury ?
[6:05:26] beerandwaffles: If someone messages me. instant not getting a invite
[6:05:29] Seawolfrss: they are an ego class most of the time tbh
[6:05:30] kidkrazyness: LOL
[6:05:30] zeeAbe: Just play elemental shaman, you will get invited to groups and then instantly removed when they realize what you are playing
[6:05:33] Heyhowsitgoingtonight: 😳 Daddy?
[6:05:36] SyberRain: Lmao daddy gotta eat!
[6:05:38] falldrgn: Daddy?? where .. Daddy Nathrius?
[6:05:39] frenzied_locke: How are you playing
[6:05:40] business_man_alex: and also AG. the best dps party heal in the game by a mile
[6:05:47] GodKingMuninn: I've been tempted to put random keybinds on my keyboard to prove you can play fury and warlock with random button mashing
[6:05:53] aggronautdh: all this havoc slander hurts to see
[6:05:53] GodKingMuninn: err dh
[6:05:54] wEiRdO_dUdE: Ele can be freakish, for sure
[6:05:59] xurem0: I've had some pumper eles in my keys, super nice
[6:06:04] zeeAbe: @Towelliee I just literally got removed x3 from a group within 25 minutes when they realized I was playing Elemental BibleThump
[6:06:10] bakeryinc_: Havoc slander Sadge
[6:06:11] Dionaut: dude a sick ele, bruh. You will think they hacking.
[6:06:12] Bernardo994: ur nasmom nastyy
[6:06:14] mmrghost7: ele aint bad they are just over shadowed by the amount of enh players out there
[6:06:15] theDRG: As a Havoc main, I just want Details to include the added dps from my 5% magic increase to my Dps bar
[6:06:15] Heero_Effect: Ya our elem shaman didn’t come back to WoW hahahahahaahahah
[6:06:16] CrunkyBrewster: they can pump
[6:06:24] Masqerader: people read tier list and assume a class is bad cause WOWhead posted a video from a couple of bozos saying its not good
[6:06:25] octnoir: Oh Emperor Palpatine from Rise of Skywalker! I love that movie!
[6:06:26] TyroneBiggums17420: how are u on...
[6:06:27] business_man_alex: that's weird because ele pumps super hard
[6:06:31] CrunkyBrewster: also fun to play too for me
[6:06:31] JrocThaGreat: @Doyle501 its abig BUff, so it will require testing
[6:06:33] Kratosjr1: Kratosjr1 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 74 months! Getting older
[6:06:46] Scarhearth: as a shaman I had a group boot me because they needed a heroism... I spent 5 minutes explaining to the guy that bloodlust and heroism are the same exact thing..
[6:06:49] zerihikaru: D: I just wanna be a better havoc
[6:06:55] Bernardo994: im on a mom dad j0oke kick today
[6:06:56] Moobot:  Check out Towelliee's YouTube channel! You can view the most recent uploaded video HERE || WoW Patch 10.0.5 | Class tuning and New Features youtu.be/86X4M9bLKQk
[6:07:15] Heero_Effect: It seems like warrior DPS is also most popular melee too
[6:07:18] g0n_z3n: @Scarhearth ugh
[6:07:23] business_man_alex: @scarhearth not a key you wanna be in.
[6:07:35] bakeryinc_: I can pull 300k on my DH. My guildmate DH can barely pull 80k. Easy class but moderate skill ceiling
[6:07:43] JrocThaGreat: @Heero_Effect easy and then your off spec is the best tank in the game
[6:07:55] khrovaa: @Scarhearth RUNNN
[6:07:59] Sylphy_TV: B - Bitches
[6:08:03] Nethil: B as bitches
[6:08:07] Foretoldlegends: It sounds like the tier system is a bias system at this rate.
[6:08:08] mmrghost7: well warrs got some nerf on 10.0.5 , i hope blood can rise even more
[6:08:13] Eviltuna13: As a Holy Priest I love all the tanks this expansion. All are easy to heal and that’s make it fun for me
[6:08:21] zerihikaru: @bakeryinc_  I'm really only confused about dh opener
[6:08:25] wEiRdO_dUdE: Bear is not going up with these new trees
[6:08:28] duffluv22: People following the great OZ!!!!
[6:08:30] business_man_alex: it's weird because except prot warrior every dps and tank specs are super close and it's all about skill level
[6:08:51] Heero_Effect: @jrocthagreat that makes sense. I mean I’m a DK DPS player but it’s pretty easy to flip to blood when needed
[6:08:53] xurem0: Started leveling my warrior, even undergeared it's night and day between that and my bear
[6:08:55] bucsarge: can you get to level 60 without the dragonflight expansion
[6:08:57] Scarhearth: @rizzalicious_ was definitely a good thing not being in the group if someone cant grasp the concept of Hero = Bloodlust = Time warp = Ancient Hysteria = whatever the evoker lust is
[6:08:58] CEK_kingdom: @Eviltuna13 i agree, spam healing tanks is super boring
[6:09:04] Ledeanna: yeah people don't seem to have a mind of thier own anymore
[6:09:04] Dox023: @towelliee this is why I just look at the mplus.subcreation site, realize every class can/spec is decent and then go back to not giving a shit.
[6:09:06] g0n_z3n: People memeing without understanding the meme
[6:09:10] Seawolfrss: i play unholy and my buddies made me tank a m+ as blood and that shit was sooo easy
[6:09:10] xurem0: @bucsarge yeah
[6:09:14] lindakri: Gotta love the blood dks with the mdi style pulls every dungeon
[6:09:24] bucsarge: thanks
[6:09:26] alwayspounding: Idk y but paladins r sick if used properly
[6:09:32] business_man_alex: if I see a high io off meta I insta invite. you know those gamers hustled to get there
[6:09:35] alwayspounding: Prot pallys are nasty
[6:09:36] retnuk3: So what class you think is going to take over for pvp?
[6:09:36] traymann84: Well I had a Warrior not able to survive 3rd boss in TJS+16. Then I did it with Bear and it was a breeze for him...Every tank can be good when he knows and bad when he doesn´t. ;)
[6:09:37] mmrghost7: but the difference between a good Bdk and a bad one is MASSIVE
[6:09:46] GodKingMuninn: brewmasters are not fun to heal :(
[6:09:49] Dionaut: As far as i know every class can do content in the game. Most just play meta or what there fav. steamer is playing.
[6:09:52] frenzied_locke: how are you playing I thought it was during maintenance
[6:09:52] bakeryinc_: @zerihikaru with what build? DH opener is every straight foreword. Just do normal rotation but add Meta during your essence break window for double eye beam and blade dance
[6:09:53] SyberRain: People are just super rigid about meta when a well played class is sufficient for 75% of the keys you typically rub
[6:09:55] GingerGambit: It’s the fact that less gear is needed and not as much skill/buttons to do the same
[6:10:05] khrovaa: i fall asleep on my blood, but i also played blood last expac where we had big dps
[6:10:05] Moobot:  Guess what? NA Servers are DOWN. DOWN BAD. Towelliee is on EU OR PTR SERVER. SERVERS WILL COME UP WHEN THEY COME UP. KTHX FOR PLAYING.
[6:10:11] theDRG: Had my Brewmaster solo tank M Eranog for 3mins waiting on Prot Warrior to be brezzed and downed the boss.
[6:10:11] cmo58: Can you give a quick summary recap of how you think bear trees gonna be now if you haven’t already 1 million times today
[6:10:23] Scarhearth: I enjoy my BDK. I can do stupid pulls that I had no reason to do outside of a warrior or BDK doing
[6:10:38] Synaerio: Too many people only wanna play the "broken" classes, specs... Can we go back to the day when people actually played what they enjoyed and were not so comformative to public opion... Players these days dont have their own ideas anymore :(
[6:10:41] NotEnoughMana: if you dont play heroic youll be better of playing a spec you actually like
[6:10:44] wEiRdO_dUdE: True
[6:10:46] zerihikaru: @bakeryinc_  I just grabbed  the single target build from icyveins
[6:10:47] business_man_alex: but that's not a bad thing. some classes should require skill to play well.
[6:10:54] lolahwhite: bewmaster had there time to shine for ever now
[6:10:54] duhworks: pally is the best M+ tank rn
[6:10:55] business_man_alex: and not do more damage
[6:10:57] Dionaut: lmao, listenting to towelliee talk, then instantly some grandma doing laso on the screen
[6:11:03] Eviltuna13: @godkingmuninn if a BM is good they are cake to heal. But most are not confident in themselves
[6:11:07] JrocThaGreat: @khrovaa Yeah soloing boss is the only thing that is fun, everybody dies and its just me and the last bit of health
[6:11:12] beerandwaffles: Same story with Disc priests
[6:11:19] wEiRdO_dUdE: SMOrc warrior go zug zug
[6:11:22] RaidbossTV: 1 out of 3 not bad
[6:11:43] Heero_Effect: I pick any tank that signs up for my key since there’s like no tanks towCry
[6:11:45] sixRlNGS_: Wait servers are back up?!
[6:11:48] REDSUNDERGROUND: i have a bad habit of hitting ignore pain instead of shield blokc XD
[6:11:49] Bernardo994: meh i am a rogue and i have no say
[6:11:52] khrovaa: did a +15 before reset on TJS, and had 3 hunters, SMOOTH run, but on last boss, all hunters try to run, trap, and kite their add. was like OK..
[6:11:53] defunked: i waited 2 hours to find a 17 key group on my fury warrior
[6:12:00] jbosco1990: i love my brewmaster
[6:12:01] wEiRdO_dUdE: Disc is getting good changes, it might be back

[6:12:44] khrovaa: @Potshop you can survive with 3, but get insane DPS with all others lol
[6:12:45] business_man_alex: yo chat does anyone feel like people are super quick to leave keys this expansion? we had one mistake and our rogue just insta leaves
[6:12:48] Bernardo994: just wen to kick
[6:12:50] jbosco1990: wait servers are up?

[6:13:21] vaereee: ppl dont wanna waste time esp if youre wiping early in a 20
[6:13:24] GingerGambit: @rizzalicious_ people leave like 9s
[6:13:31] business_man_alex: hmm that makes sense
[6:13:36] theDRG: Hey when it comes to logging, is it bad habit to just auto-upload all day with it set to public?
[6:13:38] jbosco1990: @zerihikaru  ty

[6:14:10] Very_Stickyrice: Riggs
[6:14:15] business_man_alex: there are only 17 enhance shamans so

[6:14:19] retnuk3: @Towelliee, who you think is goin to be top dps in ranked arena's this patch?

[6:15:06] Moobot:  Guess what? NA Servers are DOWN. DOWN BAD. Towelliee is on EU OR PTR SERVER. SERVERS WILL COME UP WHEN THEY COME UP. KTHX FOR PLAYING.
[6:15:06] business_man_alex: oh it went up nvm
[6:15:09] pereadin: I never understood the concept of private logging. If someone wants to poach your player for their performance so be it. It’s a game.
[6:15:17] jbosco1990: prot wars are just so good

[6:16:00] wEiRdO_dUdE: That crazy horse charge thing with paladin, and probably a lot of grips and fly with me things
[6:16:16] cabalish: west
[6:16:23] cozyzequel: when your main is a 410 prot pally :(
[6:16:33] wEiRdO_dUdE: Blood DK is one button LUL
[6:16:33] business_man_alex: get to level 70 and enjoy the ride. you are too far behind at this point to raid outside of normal
[6:16:33] atlantictaco: Hey, I'm brand new to wow. I've been playing a fury warrior. Do you think a beast master hunter is better for a new player?
[6:16:34] silversoidier: whats your fav fast food restaurant??
[6:16:37] EdLok_: yeah method didnt do bad but i was expecting more
[6:16:42] pereadin: DA FeelsGoodMan

[6:17:17] REDSUNDERGROUND: yeah and dont forget ams on the tank beam in final phase for blood is nutty
[6:17:17] Seawolfrss: we need it tho we have no mobility
[6:17:22] JrocThaGreat: @abracka_ yep lol
[6:17:22] EdLok_: you watch a wipe sometimes and the blood DK can solo for hours
[6:17:30] eakiller: nerf to DA incomming
[6:17:47] atlantictaco: @jbosco1990 Okay thanks
[6:17:48] Subbed_No_Ban: I play UH dps and I don’t know what any of the fights do tbh I just hit things
[6:17:51] jbosco1990: they shouldnt nerf tanks just buff every other tanks
[6:17:58] jbosco1990: tanks should be powerful
[6:17:59] Synaerio: DK's are built for PvP denial
[6:18:02] PvtHudson093: Deaths advance shits all over what Paladins class fantasy is supposed to be
[6:18:05] Demorthus: you just feel like that one disabled person on a wheel chair as a paladin.... everyone and their pets running ahead of you and you're ass is trying to catch up.. KEKW ask how I know
[6:18:12] NBK_Sethus: too short LUL

[6:22:15] business_man_alex: but I guess I'd look at this as methods chance to rebrand. if I was them I'd know it is impossible to compete with liquid/ echo and to create content on killing bosses with off brand specs

[6:46:23] CMack_72: Or they are busy playing the Diablo4 Alpha
[6:46:26] Kasiiama: you know what i miss Oxhorn videos being a staple in the community. Now almost no one knows about them :(
[6:46:28] bakeryinc_: Didnt they say 6pm est?
[6:46:34] amaceika: Hows the ping in EU?
[6:46:41] Demorthus: ah right
[6:46:43] BobLongMVP: Bnet and guild chat was borked all afternoon yesterday. Maybe some additional problems on backend, once again
[6:46:44] captain_khyzan: they still trying to fix tooth and claw lol... i mean jajaja
[6:46:48] g0n_z3n: its always PST
[6:46:50] shagbark_: dang Towelie you're good at time zones
[6:46:52] Heaay: Its must be a BIG patch
[6:46:52] ClassicMalcontent: Time Zones 'r' hard, (for some) Kappa
[6:46:52] g0n_z3n: for NA
[6:46:53] NVbrutal: they already pushed the patch through to the launcher so usually when they do that its not long till it goes live.
[6:46:55] Lilurrn: 3pst = 6est
[6:46:56] izzlarn65: can I lose my mind regardless
[6:47:00] Foretoldlegends: @xelle1904 There really wasn't much of a change with the druid talent tree. A talent tree done right would easily get most of the mitgations.
[6:47:01] Synonymous: have to wait all day to play FeelsBadMan
[6:47:02] abbotatoes: @towelliee what timewalking path is your favorite when leveling?
[6:47:04] Voltaictv: I personally expect them to take the full time they listed

[6:47:32] wEiRdO_dUdE: There's always that guy who says "Unsubbing!" LUL
[6:47:32] Lilurrn: not even a full patch lol
[6:47:33] spacemantiimmy: id be amaze dif they do
[6:47:35] Dionaut: Since vanilla, I always thought blizz should start patches at 2-3 am. SO servers are up at a decent time for all players.
[6:47:41] Kasiiama: i wouldnt be surprised if they finally listed a longer maintenance than intended just to give room for error.
[6:47:42] SilkeySmooth: there iint much in the patch
[6:47:46] mo_dilly84: When I worked retail I hated being off on tuesdays because tuesdays used to be the worst and always took forever
[6:47:49] ClassicMalcontent: At this rate we'll be lucky if it's on time. IMHO. Hope I'm wrong. It's been a while already. And remember they do not just patch THE GAME but backend systems too often times.

[6:48:23] izzlarn65: there's always a catch
[6:48:23] DxxCutter: Cobalt PL
[6:48:24] bakeryinc_: Cobalt power level with a DH with the mastery buffs.
[6:48:30] Kasiiama: You can get leveled hella fast from people in cobalt and a few other areas from geared people.
[6:48:30] BobLongMVP: AFK in party at cobalt. Lots of players doing it.
[6:48:33] Sadisticmedic: there was a bunch of people could not log on Last night per Blizzard

[6:49:10] Dox023: Cobalt assembly with a dh is fucking nutty
[6:49:15] slaktotv: you can do Cobalt 60-70 in 30 mins if good booster
[6:49:17] bakeryinc_: @Towelliee If he already has buffs, he could do it in that time
[6:49:19] SpectralGaming_: I leveled 4 chracters with cobalt 10-60 in one day
[6:49:19] Effin_Steffin: He’s gonna ask you to show him your hooves.

[7:04:38] Hoodie187: they gonna nerf this shit soon lol...because this is wild
[7:04:44] Demorthus: I ask because some buff balls offer movement speed; not a mastery one, for example
[7:04:48] aramhere: im the priest " allisterr "
[7:04:49] mcatx2: Blizzars always waits to nerf something after it has been fully throttled by those who were able to take advantage

[7:05:25] Synonymous: monkaS
[7:05:26] Xel_n_Hell: @Crystalyzee its in no way a buff, we lose 5% dmg on AS and RF and lose 5% grit on AS and RF because we can no longer pick them talents

[7:11:24] Xel_n_Hell: @Crystalyzee also saying its. a 4% buff is very vague, is this st dmg or aoe ,does this take into consideration that we can no longer have both st dmg and aoe in the same build no?

[7:36:44] Ponickz: .333 repeating

[7:39:00] zerihikaru: @bakeryinc_  something to use across all the raids
[7:39:17] ghost186_: DK death strike only effects melee dmg. To be fair they were way to Tanky on casters anyway and needed the nerf

[8:39:36] tocu: that timer seemed like a reasonable amount of time when your adding a feature as big as the tradeing post (I assume they already had the catalyst ready to turn on since it was always planned)  so I expect it to at minimum go the full length

[8:42:36] Dionaut: Not gonna lie, When I heard the whole china shutting down. Was thinking here come a black market orc statue...... rip
[8:42:37] tocu: I kinda feel like since Blizzard stop being under the philosophy we will ship the product when ready they should lose the whole "TM" thing its been at least a decade

[8:42:53] Ledeanna: yeah they can with a VPN and lag
[8:42:58] Foretoldlegends: Plus I think Chinese servers had very specific censorships that stopped them from playing with others.
[8:43:01] cerealkillas22: Ping / latency might be pretty bad for chinese trying to play on NA servers / eu servers
[8:43:17] Smokebear: if servers down how play wow
[8:43:19] jerseyfive: they will invade taiwan monkaS
[8:43:29] Foretoldlegends: That and also China tried to take a cut out  of the subscription money. So for all we know, Blizzard might make more money.
[8:43:31] Kanrad: Yes, the dev from classic admited wrath and dragonflight where forced out early by activision
[8:43:33] Zellidon: OW2 wasn't ready with the PvE right

[8:44:26] haveachub: how early were they pushed out? because waiting any longer wouldve been disastrous for a sub base

[8:44:36] iccyc0ld: It couldn't be worse than The Division 2 where they removed content to time gate it
[8:44:36] ripperofbong420: as a casual player i really like dragonflight, one of the best imo
[8:44:36] wEiRdO_dUdE: I was trying to think of an example of something unfinished in Dragonflight, and I can't
[8:44:38] sgreth: Launch day was a little rough, but that's not out of the ordinary.

[8:44:51] MerrickMoon: DF is good! People just got burnt with SL
[8:44:54] im_capy: DF seems fine if this was a "rush"
[8:44:57] YinYangMan77: Holinka came out hard pro-union due to some of the internal strife they're facing.
[8:45:01] love_meii: @leeeanthony huh??
[8:45:02] firehawk73: Clean launch...except for Azure Span laaaaaaaaag
[8:45:05] Dionaut: Hell launch day was better then sl. Could at least get on
[8:45:06] Zavier420: @chickdrummer88  /hugs How ya been?
[8:45:06] chickdrummer88: @looney199725 I'm talking about OW2 if you actually read what I was responding to towKawaii
[8:45:10] tocu: I think if they didnt rush it the ring of blood wouldnt break on a weekly bases and stay broken until a server restart
[8:45:10] Heero_Effect: DF Launch was smooth I think. I mean I didn’t play until the weekend but I had no issues.
[8:45:13] leeeanthony: Take that pinned msg off mine works
[8:45:14] hooliggan: @Towelliee what's your take on the prot warrior changes?
[8:45:15] Thoreya: ya always said DF delay was hella exagerrated
[8:45:16] neverbornlucky: Good News Chat the servers are still down I just checked
[8:45:20] DogShep: https://twitter.com/BrianBirming/status/1617688557367488512?cxt=HHwWgMDTsYHLl_MsAAAA
[8:45:21] wEiRdO_dUdE: You can make an argument that more time for tuning would have been nicer, sure
[8:45:28] looney199725: @chickdrummer88 lol ow2 was a pile of dirt its just ow1 anyways
[8:45:32] im_capy: given how slow SL patches were, then sure this seems like a "rush" LUL
[8:45:37] DogShep: The classic dude that got pushed out. Said "pressure to deliver both expansions early"
[8:45:38] tatertotpauls: check his twitter thread
[8:45:41] Zellidon: There's also this article with devs talking D4 being rushed
[8:45:42] Thoreya: never will they delay an expansion for tuning purposes lol
[8:45:47] darksun2020: @leeeanthony shhh troll, go to school
[8:45:48] james_bah: doesnt feel rushed to me
[8:45:49] chickdrummer88: @Zavier420 Haaaaay! <3

[8:46:09] chickdrummer88: @looney199725 It's not, but ok whatever helps you sleep at night LUL
[8:46:13] Armdel: it doesn't say its unfinished, just that they were probably under crunch
[8:46:15] Heero_Effect: Lol he got fired. Now he is talking mad shit.
[8:46:21] neverbornlucky: Towelliee what do you think if we get Elemental Lords in this expansion to kill ?
[8:46:25] Nokterian: it wasnt unfinished but being pushed is awful
[8:46:30] Sollice: @Heero_Effect He got fired or he left?
[8:46:31] Hitokiri83: may have been finished but it needed a bit more polishing imo
[8:46:37] YinYangMan77: as far as live services go..."finished"
[8:46:38] DogShep: @Heero_Effect I suggest reading what happened before saying this
[8:46:42] BTiZZY_: @Heero_Effect talking mad shit? or being honest with whats going on lol. and he left he didnt get fired
[8:46:45] belfastcl: @Heero_Effect he took a stance for people under him
[8:46:49] GodKingMuninn: what large scaled project ISNT under a crunch lol
[8:46:50] j_bar111: He was trying to say there was pressure to finish and they did but then he had to say that people didnt perform
[8:46:53] im_capy: turns out that deadline of December 31st that was announce a long time early, was actually something they needed to do......crazy right....no not at all
[8:46:53] wEiRdO_dUdE: Getting back on Q4 releases is better for business, many of us understood that specific pressure
[8:47:02] DogShep: He went to HR saying he was thinking of leaving due to the performance review stacking bs
[8:47:05] Nokterian: If you ever experienced being pushed on your job its soul crushing
[8:47:14] hojzy: Big chance this expansion will be a WoD lol.
[8:47:17] dschmidt: People all up in arms about the bell curve, it is standard practice in SO many massive companies. Is it fair? Absolutely not, but Blizzard are far from the first to put it into practice
[8:47:25] giggz91: @Towelliee server list is up
[8:47:31] ripperofbong420: performance rating
[8:47:32] Sollice: @dschmidt That is correct. Always sucks dick but it's reality
[8:47:36] Heero_Effect: Guys I read the story. What he describes is corporate mentality. I have no sympathy, you chose to work there you play the game. If not leave find a new job
[8:47:39] WundertueteGER: I wonder who the guardian druid is under the developers KEKW
[8:47:40] firehawk73: At that time, of course they we "under crunch"....the Microsoft sale was still happened....needed to get the expac out this fiscal year
[8:47:40] Cyrux85: list are always up
[8:47:42] TheGiant99: Sloot still beating it wasn't ready
[8:47:44] tocu: @GodKingMuninn anything with good managment mostly including scope and budget
[8:47:47] wEiRdO_dUdE: Yeah the rating thing is a totally different issue
[8:47:48] Moobot:  Guess what? NA Servers are DOWN. DOWN BAD. Towelliee is on EU OR PTR SERVER. NA SERVERS WILL COME UP SOON™ towCopium
[8:47:54] banadona: finished, far from it
[8:48:15] Sollice: Aside from class tuning, what do you think was left?
[8:48:22] asmodai4823: it was clear war was overpowered and they did nothing
[8:48:23] tocu: the ring of blood
[8:48:26] cerealkillas22: Warlock final nodes still dogshit Sadge
[8:48:28] Djfarmville: work order system
[8:48:39] Voltaictv: This expansion still miles better than SL, so no reason to complain imo
[8:48:40] im_capy: hate on ABK sure, not Blizz
[8:48:44] banadona: professions? crafting orders?
[8:48:45] JaeDee: Lmao people think the craziest shit
[8:48:53] DogShep: I think crafting could've used another testing pass but otherwise the expansion is amazing and fun
[8:48:55] firehawk73: clearly, the final raid isn't done yet
[8:48:56] Doomsaga: i still havent talents that arent working
[8:48:56] Molvonos: The hot takes are amazing.
[8:49:00] JaeDee: People want PERFECT lmao
[8:49:00] dannyis1337: they arent going to nerf warrior into the ground or else 90% of the tanks would have to reroll
[8:49:02] Sollice: @banadona What gives you any indications that left to be done
[8:49:02] Doomsaga: have*
[8:49:04] wEiRdO_dUdE: Crafting orders were in from the start
[8:49:10] JaeDee: Shit isn’t perfect that’s why they have to fix it
[8:49:10] tocu: it breaks all the time making it impossible for anyone to do  the ring of blood for days at a time
[8:49:11] reggiepowa: elemental storms, they are finishing them now
[8:49:12] Khyr_: is valor cap gone?
[8:49:19] james_bah: vault?
[8:49:19] jdpower13: people reaching, release was miles better than most recent xpacs
[8:49:20] Zellidon: I don't think WoW is the best example of Blizzard rushing their games. I think people are mostly referring to WC3:Reforged, OW2, and D4 @Towelliee
[8:49:20] im_capy: The boat took 5 extra minutes to arrive......BURN IT ALL DOWN
[8:49:21] hojzy: @voltaictv Shadowlands launch was good aswell. Dont be fooled too soon.
[8:49:25] GodKingMuninn: professions are fine, they explicity stated they were starting small and were going to further build the system on player feed back
[8:49:26] all_the_tanks: I got my lariat via crafting orders
[8:49:28] Zzorski: @Towelliee When you level an alt do you finish the entire campaign on your alts or do you skip all that extra shit?
[8:49:28] landonconnor: There was alot of open world content / leveling stuff that was bugged.
[8:49:29] Prestige2464: I feel like they have been super quick about listening to our feedback and changing things. I love this expac and think they did a fantastic job.
[8:49:32] Gingerprimer: @Khyr_ no
[8:49:40] Reck179: balanced =/= complete, not sure what people don't get about that
[8:49:42] s7wede: I feel very content for it being the release candidate of the new expansion. I have made tons of gold crafting, had fun iin the old dungeons and hated the amount of mechanics in the new dungeons but that is me every expansion
[8:49:44] ashwing_: stupidity is rising in chat i see
[8:49:46] Allvarez: yeah only draw back was lag on major servers, but its always like that
[8:49:52] mrrager09: this seems to me like people just complaining to complain cause its wow
[8:49:54] Voltaictv: @hojzy .5 patch delivered in half the time
[8:49:54] Chiphazzord: the ring of blood wq hasnt worked in 6 weeks
[8:49:59] Bama05: this expansion has been one of the best so far, in regards to feedback and stuff to do
[8:50:00] mavericks312: ppl just making shit up at this point now
[8:50:00] wEiRdO_dUdE: I made it through all the quests, too

[8:50:16] ripperofbong420: bugs and the game not being finished are not the same thing. youre play testing playing the first weeks
[8:50:21] Heero_Effect: What AAA game isn’t crunched today haha
[8:50:21] GingerGambit: Sure launch had the loot system that was abused but oh well XD
[8:50:22] Doomsaga: screams of the void is still broken
[8:50:22] galifax2: The only bugged wq I find often is the climbing one by the time dragons in thaldrazsus
[8:50:28] dschmidt: Bugs != unfinished.
[8:50:28] arcanitejr: @Towelliee whats the best tank to learn M+ in?
[8:50:32] asmodai4823: you mean like nerfing the boss by 50% so it can be killable?
[8:50:35] Dionaut: cyberpunk 2077 is a prime example of a game coming out incomplete
[8:50:41] bakerbaker019: servers up?
[8:50:41] MerrickMoon: Those alerts are sick!
[8:50:42] banadona: gamebraking is not the same as unfinished
[8:50:54] chickdrummer88: @bakerbaker019 Read the pinned message
[8:50:54] zerihikaru: fallout 76
[8:50:55] tocu: Finished but if it was not crunched and  rushed it would have been better
[8:50:57] Dozeker: I think Dragonflight was decent I remember WoD and having phasing issues and had to lvl with pet battles
[8:50:59] Djfarmville: ^
[8:51:00] BennyHaste: i did have a few that bugged with dumb bugs just quest items left in my bag when dropping a quest might have had another bug from dropping a quest but its been clean
[8:51:07] Wikedlyrics: Cyberpunk btw KEKW
[8:51:08] GingerGambit: Not the first time they have nerfed bosses afterwards, common thing
[8:51:09] mavericks312: @banadona wrong, nothing was wrong with DF at launch
[8:51:11] SahdTimes: SahdTimes subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 91 months! 
[8:51:12] Voltaictv: I think people just want to bitch because they got use to it from SL nonsense
[8:51:12] looney199725: every game comes out with bugs EVERY ppl shill for FF14 so much do they forget the shitshow that was they had to relaunch the whole game
[8:51:14] Valearleen: @Dionaut not its not? LUL i dont think you know what incomplet is
[8:51:14] alwayspounding: It’s like he’s getting paid by blizzard
[8:51:19] cerealkillas22: If its a warlock bug its just never addressed
[8:51:23] im_capy: but that isnt the trend, you need to hate wow regardless. Its what all the "cool kids" are doing
[8:51:24] Chiphazzord: i still want the ring of blood WQ to work though its still bugged

[8:52:14] crunchyFrog999: MMOs are big projects, no surprises on bugs .. lol
[8:52:15] RollieTheZergling: unfinished can also mean rough or unpolished, which there is an argument for. im overall happy with the release tho

[8:52:16] Dionaut: Uhhhh if you mean crap tons of game content got gutted and removed from game or even added like it was supposed to. To make a launch time that already got delayed multiple times. If you dont think thats incomplete then i dont know what is
[8:52:18] OhNoNotAgain: Worth every Wildstar, TomCruise gifted sub if you ask me.

[8:54:21] GodKingMuninn: This is the longest some people have quit wow in months.
[8:54:24] im_capy: love to hear that
[8:54:25] Kuocolaya: People that complain about the game being unfinished are the same ones that bitch about maintenance.
[8:54:27] looney199725: bfa content was gd ye
[8:54:27] Chiphazzord: you cant quit. quiting is an option servers are down so u cant quit what u cant play
[8:54:27] Faymous: Gross
[8:54:28] mmo_kenna_: BFA was class
[8:54:30] asmodai4823: BFA KEKW
[8:54:33] Yurian33: With all the tree issues in M+ I have changed my mind... Sylvanus did nothing wrong
[8:54:35] Dcarter: ive only played 4 expansions i think
[8:54:36] wEiRdO_dUdE: BFA was up there
[8:54:39] ripperofbong420: bfas passive gold system was actually goated
[8:54:42] caboose1029: BFA is number 2 for me
[8:54:42] aDirtybirdy: What was #1 and 2
[8:54:43] ThePeppaJack04: where was legion?
[8:54:44] hojzy: BoD was a good raid
[8:54:45] Dionaut: WHats 1 n 2 ?
[8:54:46] GodKingMuninn: BFA was shit until .3 - the .3 patch with vendor fucking CLAPPED
[8:54:48] Voltaictv: Loved MoP, dont get why so many disliked it
[8:54:50] notdustinx: i loved NyaLotha. Most addicted to raiding i ever was
[8:54:51] Todmeister9000: BFA was awesome
[8:54:55] khronicz: WoD has to be best expansion
[8:54:57] dannyis1337: Legion the Goat
[8:54:59] zerihikaru: I started going back through old xpacs to unlock jeeves e.e
[8:55:02] landonconnor: Bfa corruption vendor was amazing
[8:55:04] turfjitsu: @Voltaictv MoP was righteous
[8:55:05] Chiphazzord: as a vanilla baby this mantanace is short
[8:55:06] cerealkillas22: BFA was great if you played a singular specc
[8:55:07] Hammerify: I played legion and DF, quit because of how awful BFA felt in the first month
[8:55:08] Dcarter: legion is one of my fav expansion across all MMOs
[8:55:10] Molvonos: At no point is a MMO, or any online game played with people, ever 'Finished'.  Hell, no MOBA is ever 'finished' either.  To die on the hill of 'This game came out incomplete' is a fucking joke.
[8:55:15] turfjitsu: Huge fan of WoD idk
[8:55:19] dannyis1337: hot take WoD > BFA
[8:55:19] khrovaa: yeah nya was my fav raid since i came back to wow
[8:55:23] iloveyalunn: People that didnt even play BFA like to talk about how bad it is. LUL
[8:55:24] cerealkillas22: Legion is prob my favorite
[8:55:26] tocu: I think BFA ranks bellow every FF14 exspansion by a sizable amount
[8:55:31] ascendence94: @Towelliee shadowlands was first expansion since i started prepatch of shadowlands XD
[8:55:37] GodKingMuninn: I loved WoD, but I also spent a good chunk of it in ashran and doing world content
[8:55:39] Chiphazzord: 18 years of wow haS MADE ME NUTS
[8:55:39] Synaerio: Fun theory: Blizzard selling each new xpac is them publicly selling a share of their company, and you rent a slot to access the servers to play the content via a monthly fee.
[8:55:39] TheOldSchoolRyan: Looking back at how long i played wow, makes me sick to my stomach, thinking about the time that has passed
[8:55:40] turfjitsu: looks good to me *crazy eyes gif*
[8:55:40] notdustinx: Wasn't HFC WoD?
[8:55:42] ripperofbong420: i member when burning crusade came out and blew everyones minds. bc is prolly my favorite rose tinted glasses expac
[8:55:42] Kasiiama: IDK SL was worse thna WoD no doubt. The ONLY bad part of WoD was lack of content. SL was just bad.
[8:55:43] Deeds_of_Love: The Wod trailer was the best ever
[8:55:43] Keglett: OPEN THE GATES
[8:55:45] ascendence94: BibleThump
[8:55:48] YinYangMan77: @landonconnor aside from corruptions being cursed with gating at the end of an expansion...sure
[8:55:48] Daismoon: Played every expansion from beginning to end and bitched the entire time
[8:55:48] james_bah: wod was soo good /copium
[8:55:51] protocols_: Where is dragon flight on your list so far? And what’s your 1 n 2?
[8:55:52] banadona: I'm loving DF but saying it came out 100% finished when it did, that is delusion
[8:55:56] turfjitsu: me me me me
[8:55:56] neverbornlucky: was watching some linus tech stuff where they were roasting chinese computers for lunar new years set up. One of the computers was made out of a soup container and another out of a camping stove
[8:55:59] arcanitejr: Honestly my favorite expansion I fully played while live was Cataclysm
[8:56:03] zerihikaru: call me crazy I've enjoyed the game as a whole
[8:56:06] snake_like: WoD walked so Legion could run. facts
[8:56:06] darkdestroz: Wod was log in raid DO dailies Log out,
[8:56:07] Foretoldlegends: I give WoD a 5/10 but if it HAD all the cut content in game, it'd have been more a 7/10
[8:56:11] Chiphazzord: WOW WAS GOOD FOR GOLD MAKING
[8:56:13] Reck179: WOD Mythic Raiding Kreygasm
[8:56:15] dannyis1337: WoD pvp and class design was good
[8:56:16] Strifelol: I played all the xpacs and wod was the worst until shadowlands came hahaha
[8:56:17] notdustinx: Okay i actually REALLY enjoy Vault of Incarnates
[8:56:18] cerealkillas22: @banadona agreed specc balance is all over the place amongst the classes
[8:56:19] Plague_GG: Mythic came out at WoD pre patch in SoO
[8:56:22] big__truss: both were bad
[8:56:27] JaeDee: JD3MON subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 2 months! :)
[8:56:27] tocu: Oh I explain how WOD Was better than shadowlands very easily
[8:56:30] Draz3nx: prefer wod over shadowlands tbh
[8:56:35] Dionaut: I always looked at WoD as more of them just testing out all there new systems they implamented. More then an actual xpac.
[8:56:36] tocu: its really not hard at all
[8:56:37] GingerGambit: Didn’t WoD almost kill the game?
[8:56:39] dawnovun: Current raids are by far the best raids in at least a decade.
[8:56:40] Wikedlyrics: WoD log in once a day for passive gold, raid once a week, never leave garrison outside of raid KEKW
[8:56:40] Snabido: WoD prepatch gave us mythic raid
[8:56:42] Snabido: Me thinks
[8:56:43] cerealkillas22: @banadona a lot of class capstone talents are dogwater / need attention too
[8:56:50] Chiphazzord: story time
[8:56:52] notdustinx: Flex Raiding in MoP changed the game
[8:56:53] Kuocolaya: WoD was my goldmaking expansion
[8:56:54] Bowwjack: @Towelliee outside of Garrison's not being what everyone wanted them to be what was actually bad about WoD?
[8:57:01] wEiRdO_dUdE: I thought Tanaan Jungle in WoD was badass, it just came out a little late
[8:57:08] ripperofbong420: hot take 420
[8:57:16] scema12: Wod at least had a cohesive thought out story line
[8:57:22] Faymous: LUL
[8:57:23] Sylphy_TV: towCopium
[8:57:23] im_capy: WoD let us all pay for subs with our garrisons LUL
[8:57:23] khronicz: I don't think there will ever be hype around an expansion like there was around BC.. standing outside a gamestop for hours to pick up the expansion
[8:57:25] Chiphazzord: some ones huffing so gooood stuff
[8:57:26] mavericks312: tanaan jungle was top tier garbage
[8:57:27] mmo_kenna_: Much better TECH in the modern game, QOL quicker more complex
[8:57:32] Strifelol: WoD was a lot of people gold making xpac lmao
[8:57:33] Kasiiama: i mean what about WoD was bad, except lack of content and garrison? The raids were great, world content was neat. Im not about to judge story cause everyones opinion is different.
[8:57:41] Dionaut: Bruh, yall gonna make towel start drinking hella early xD
[8:57:44] Faymous: dude what are these trash ass takes LUL
[8:57:47] JaeDee: Lmaooo
[8:57:47] landonconnor: Vault is good
[8:57:49] notdustinx: I miss Castle Nathria....
[8:57:50] Strifelol: Selling archimonde was so good lol
[8:57:50] Moobot:  Guess what? NA Servers are DOWN. DOWN BAD. Towelliee is on EU OR PTR SERVER. NA SERVERS WILL COME UP SOON™ towCopium
[8:57:52] derpz: Best? No. Most difficult? Yes
[8:57:53] Thoreya: if a game has no content its bad
[8:57:54] Chiphazzord: wod had legit raids and thats about it
[8:57:54] the_laundryman: ToT / SoO Kreygasm
[8:57:54] Thoreya: like what
[8:57:56] Hitokiri83: wod had so much cut content and dont forget the selfie cam patch
[8:57:57] Snabido: Ayo, time to bring up a raid tier list LUL
[8:57:57] haveachub: ToT was top 3 raids of all time
[8:57:57] ThePeppaJack04: Nighthold was dope af
[8:57:58] landonconnor: Nighthold is king tho
[8:57:58] kraydom: Nighthold was so good.
[8:57:59] Synaerio: MoP raids were fun xD
[8:58:00] scema12: Highmaul was a bad raid
[8:58:00] haveachub: by far
[8:58:01] im_n0t_jezus: LUL
[8:58:01] Faymous: LMAOOO
[8:58:01] tocu: Starting off having the continent splint into 5 seconds meaning the game  didnt value the players time from the direct offset of playing the game.   Their graveyard placement is the worst in the games history. The only issue WOD had was not alot to do which end of the day I think is a positive feature not a negative
[8:58:03] Wikedlyrics: Vault is alright for a first tier but it can't stand up to GOAT raids
[8:58:03] BelllGoR: KEKW
[8:58:04] Sylphy_TV: Call the medic man down
[8:58:05] mavericks312: vaults not even better then nathria stop it
[8:58:06] fire_fawkes: Legion was the best after a slow start
[8:58:07] nerdiepants5762: XD
[8:58:08] lightningstrikes007: timeless isle and the kill all your mates trinket was the best thing invented in wow
[8:58:09] stonyman187: cabin fever has set in
[8:58:11] castlecastles: i do think vault is fun tho
[8:58:11] paterick: lmfao
[8:58:12] GodKingMuninn: Vault of Incarnates is very mid. Sennarth was incredibly fun though
[8:58:13] ColinHoot: Even castle natty was really fun
[8:58:13] ripperofbong420: i have an idea, if youre over 21 and its legal just hit the blunt and chill
[8:58:15] dschmidt: Chat be WILDING today
[8:58:16] HunterxRVA: @Towelliee best raid in WoW history in your opinion is what?
[8:58:16] cerealkillas22: that nigthold cinematic was prob one of the best raid cinematics
[8:58:16] crunchyFrog999: extended maintenance is a crime against humanity SwiftRage
[8:58:17] LoneRangers: Cata was it man
[8:58:19] ascendence94: @Towelliee if you did rank vault where do u think you would put it
[8:58:21] notdustinx: Heart of Fear 8/10
[8:58:25] ascendence94: cuz i really like it
[8:58:26] Foretoldlegends: I'll tell you something crazy. I loved Dire Ma- Okay. I can't say that seriously.
[8:58:27] paterick: pimp in distress
[8:58:28] scema12: Vault is still a good raid , sure not the best but good
[8:58:35] dawnovun: @Towelliee  - What's wrong with the new raids? They feel fun and very rewarding when doing Mythic Raiding.
[8:58:37] mavericks312: heart of fear was trash
[8:58:39] xmedpakx: i enjoyed ToT overall
[8:58:39] Sylphy_TV: Clickers all of you!
[8:58:40] Chiphazzord: we need to stop having a race to the bottom from xpacs
[8:58:43] Miklagard: I can't belive world of warcraft is now a tarisland clone KEKW
[8:58:45] 1bussyb: i wish i played cata
[8:58:45] tocu: SL also had 6ish time gates at launch when people told them this is a garbage idea just to push more people to sub longer than they normally would in an exspansion
[8:58:46] Kasiiama: I think if WoD had M+ 90% of people wouldnt of complained about the xpac.
[8:58:46] notdustinx: Vault is very fun to start
[8:58:52] snake_like: Vault just doesn't have enough variety I think. Sennarth and Raz spice it up. It's good but could be better
[8:58:54] Strifelol: Ulduar best raid of all time
[8:58:54] Thoreya: nothing will prob touch Nathria as a first raid
[8:58:57] Strifelol: gg
[8:58:57] Thoreya: that was lit
[8:58:58] Dionaut: This... this chat is what wow is missing. good ol barren chat. Just 8 different conversations. all mixed up everyone confused and lost. Love the chaos <3
[8:59:07] notdustinx: Not as coolas Daddy Denathrius
[8:59:07] xmedpakx: WoD had challenge modes
[8:59:09] dannyis1337: WoD had challenge modes
[8:59:15] Teriyakibro: Maw walkers really out here today
[8:59:18] Grock: @Towelliee when do u think they will announce 10.1?
[8:59:20] Strifelol: Firelands was super sick too
[8:59:20] bigal818: how are you playing right now?
[8:59:21] ripperofbong420: i actually really liked mechagon when it came out. i cant member the raid name but it was alot of fun
[8:59:23] MeekPR4L: Nathria was one of my favorites in recent years
[8:59:26] zerihikaru: @dionaut  so trade chat? :3
[8:59:28] Lobby_WoW: imperator fight in highmaul was fun!!
[8:59:30] james_bah: shadowlands nostalgia yikes
[8:59:32] Kasiiama: I dont get why people think Nathria was so good. That raid was not that great.
[8:59:32] GingerGambit: 8 is a good number of boss and only 3 of them are challenging
[8:59:34] mmo_kenna_: Nathria great theme tho castle
[8:59:36] Wikedlyrics: @Kasiiama we already saw what WoD M+ would look like with grimrail, iron docks and SBG and nah dawg, it would of been trash
[8:59:37] Grock: sludgefist so good
[8:59:40] Chiphazzord: we need more frokm the sir
[8:59:40] Thoreya: sludgefist was also goated
[8:59:41] trumptight: @bigal818 pays blizzard for access
[8:59:44] ItsXolten: EU?
[8:59:45] Strifelol: SLG was awful
[8:59:47] cerealkillas22: SASHAY LEFT
[8:59:48] mavericks312: nah id say atleast 4 good fights
[8:59:49] abracka_: daddy nathrius tho
[8:59:50] landonconnor: Sludge and sire carried
[8:59:51] mmo_kenna_: eternal palace was better
[8:59:53] notdustinx: Sludge, Dance boss, Daddy
[8:59:53] MeekPR4L: @Strifelol wow firelands, id love to go back for a raid
[8:59:55] flebbooo: Huntsman KEKW
[8:59:56] Moobot: No need to repeat yourself, @bigal818 (warning)
[8:59:58] Tripl3dot: shriekwing isnt bad, huntsman was fine
[8:59:59] reggiepowa: xymox was good
[9:00:01] protocols_: Dragon soul 🔥🔥
[9:00:02] GingerGambit: The dance
[9:00:02] Bowwjack: @Towelliee honestly think Emerald Nightmare was the best first raid
[9:00:04] Dionaut: @zerihikaru nah trade chat just gets to paint chip eating lvls. Just takes the fun out of it.
[9:00:05] mcatx2: Yea, the weekly charges with the catalyst is a time gated horrible idea from Blizzard. Most of the player base doesn't want timed gated BS, but just like always Blizzard tries to overthink
[9:00:05] im_capy: felt like that raid had time cut from being developed
[9:00:06] mavericks312: xy mox
[9:00:06] GodKingMuninn: Xymox, Sludge. Denathrius, Council of Blood was fun
[9:00:08] Pallyofhell: fuck the dance LUL
[9:00:10] Djfarmville: Dancing boss forsenPls
[9:00:10] scema12: I feel like sludge is overrated tbh, just me
[9:00:11] Vonippo: little dancy dance
[9:00:11] Cafe0le: i liked vault bosses, the look was just mid
[9:00:13] Tripl3dot: BOOGIE DOWN
[9:00:13] xmedpakx: seems very few ppl read the drop down lol
[9:00:18] notdustinx: Dance boss, called out all the white people asap
[9:00:23] Strifelol: COUNCIL OF BLOOD
[9:00:25] cerealkillas22: ELETRIC SLIDE forsenPls
[9:00:25] mmo_kenna_: what you think next raid will be?
[9:00:26] Heero_Effect: HotPokket
[9:00:28] mavericks312: your forgetting xymox
[9:00:30] MeekPR4L: @Bowjack31 that would be a hard pass for me
[9:00:30] Strifelol: Someone said something crqzy
[9:00:32] ripperofbong420: emerald nightmare was fire when it released. i second whomever said taht
[9:00:32] tocu: @Strifelol It was also the worst because it was too good it took them way longer to launch it than previous and up coming raid tiers so it set an unreasonable expections for how good raids could be (devs at the time admited to this internally)
[9:00:33] landonconnor: Emerald nightmare was really good too. Just very undertuned unfortunately
[9:00:33] Kasiiama: @Kasiiama Thats trying to tune dungeons not designed around M+ to be M+... If M+ was in mind on the initial design it wouldnt of been the same. this is a disingenuous take.
[9:00:37] Strifelol: Server pls come up
[9:00:48] sinlesssinner: hes last
[9:00:48] Chiphazzord: more dragons though
[9:00:48] cerealkillas22: DJARADIN BOIS
[9:00:51] Teriyakibro: true
[9:00:54] thiccsushi: Final raid tier we fight nzoth again
[9:00:55] GingerGambit: Gnolls!
[9:00:56] MeekPR4L: every raid tier will be primalist
[9:01:00] sinlesssinner: Iridikron is the one that is tied to Old GOds
[9:01:00] looney199725: its 100% primalist haha
[9:01:02] ripperofbong420: its 100 percent got to be old god corruption.
[9:01:05] GingerGambit: Gives us that raid with Gnolls
[9:01:06] Reck179: Maybe he has a human form like the Aspects
[9:01:09] MeekPR4L: we will be going to kill all
[9:01:11] leeeanthony: It’s old god stuff and feathering coming back
[9:01:11] Chiphazzord: galacrong or old gods
[9:01:14] GodKingMuninn: Next raid is just smashing a vulpera infestation of org.
[9:01:16] tocu: I am 99% sure its Myrizon in a TImeless raid
[9:01:19] mmo_kenna_: dragonriding in a raid?
[9:01:25] khrovaa: WE love OLD GODS
[9:01:29] james_bah: 9.1 raid will be ulduar 2.0
[9:01:30] shimwood: Sylvanas is the big bad of the expansion
[9:01:30] Fortvila: OR we will know wich one of them is the main boss ?
[9:01:32] Foretoldlegends: Honestly, I feel It's going to be an old god or the ressurection of Galakrond somehow from the past.
[9:01:32] paulson14: jailer returns
[9:01:33] wakeandbacon95: PrideWave
[9:01:36] Chiphazzord: undead galakrond
[9:01:37] paulson14: back to the maw
[9:01:37] konoko8: big bad will be someone who we never seen @Towelliee  just like raz
[9:01:38] Strifelol: Void bosses inc
[9:01:39] mmo_kenna_: i liked the intro to vaults
[9:01:42] mcatx2: Jailer possess Sylvanas and will return to be the big baddie
[9:01:43] GingerGambit: Time travel raid could also be fun
[9:01:43] Miklagard: The true evil is clearly Khadgard whenever something bad happens he is right there KEKW
[9:01:46] Snabido: The gnoll boss in Brackenhide escaped too I believe, so decay magic is still in play for later
[9:01:46] patchscar: Tyr was prob corrupted, and we will see him
[9:01:46] snake_like: I'm already tired of the earthen aesthetic from vault. Iridikron and the potential underground stuff kind of portends that theme staying
[9:01:47] Booogie0: @Towelliee  tond forget Ragnaros can still come back :D =))
[9:01:47] iloveyalunn: The Ghost of Danny DiVito
[9:01:49] dawnovun: The Big Bad of 10.7 will be an enormous Rat named "KOTICK"
[9:01:51] Sylphy_TV: Jailer towCopium hes back
[9:01:54] PvtHudson093: The 4 Primal Dragons combine to form Captain Dragon
[9:01:54] GodKingMuninn: @Guyladriel Uldir was 2.0 - it would be 3.0
[9:01:54] mmo_kenna_: ulduar intro is also S tier
[9:01:56] Strifelol: Void xpac next
[9:01:59] TheOldSchoolRyan: Iridikron is weird to say
[9:02:00] Kasiiama: Can we please have 1-2 boss raids again! i miss having raids like Vault of Archavon or Obsid sanctum. Ony etc.
[9:02:05] cerealkillas22: i think were gonna go deep underground and encounter djaradin and shit too
[9:02:05] castlecastles: bro they always get us with the "avatars, visions, images" \
[9:02:09] Strifelol: YES
[9:02:11] Chiphazzord: they already hinted at necromancers bringing back people in nokund so galakrond makes sense
[9:02:13] gregl__: LUL
[9:02:16] ripperofbong420: ulduar was insane
[9:02:18] Strifelol: Ulfuar is the best raid of all time for suuuuurw
[9:02:19] Foretoldlegends: I'll say it now. I think we'll go back in time due to the infinite dragonflight and kill Galakrond.
[9:02:19] Kasiiama: Crucible of Storms was so neat in BFA, idk why they dont do mini raids more often.
[9:02:21] dawnovun: Ulduar was WAY too easy though.
[9:02:22] mavericks312: id say ToT over ulduar
[9:02:24] Strifelol: Ulduar**
[9:02:27] Kanrad: WoW expansion and bosses are not a suprise anymore, we'll deal with the immediate dragon threats and fight and old god that was behind the scences the whole expansion. Or did you forget the team that makes these games and their limited story ideas?
[9:02:30] Boss_Corgi: Throne of Thunder
[9:02:31] paulson14: ICC?
[9:02:35] Dark_Kornax: @Towelliee and yet they haven't made another raid like it.
[9:02:36] MisterHooyah: siege of orgrimmar
[9:02:38] Daismoon: The original...not this classic shiot
[9:02:38] hooliggan: @Towelliee Realm list is gone....
[9:02:38] paterick: na kara was
[9:02:39] OverlordMike25: wait is the game up or are you playing on eu atm
[9:02:41] ghernandess: i'm betting in a infinite dragonflight raid with galakrond and sh** cause infinites like to do these "let's screw timelines" thing
[9:02:43] dinomiyte: lol wtf
[9:02:46] PvtHudson093: Easy now but back then it was hard
[9:02:47] ripperofbong420: what? people got fucked in ulduar. frost was insane
[9:02:47] Strifelol: Ulduar/Nighthold/Firelands
[9:02:48] lightningstrikes007: ssc elevator was the best of all time
[9:02:48] GingerGambit: Easy doesn’t mean not good
[9:02:50] Kasiiama: Blackrock Foundry is my #1 that raid was sick.
[9:02:51] Moobot:  Guess what? NA Servers are DOWN. DOWN BAD. Towelliee is on EU OR PTR SERVER. NA SERVERS WILL COME UP SOON™ towCopium
[9:02:54] Snabido: Better say classic KEKW
[9:02:56] Heero_Effect: Maybe next raid, save our queen slyvanus :)
[9:02:56] Pharaoh_326: old school was a guild crusher lol  not easy
[9:03:00] tocu: Ulduar without using hard modes might have been easy but they put in hard modes for the first time.
[9:03:00] notdustinx: oooo firelands was cool
[9:03:01] IlionDK: i with they bought back hardmode versions of bosses
[9:03:07] mcatx2: WOD
[9:03:07] IlionDK: wish*

[9:03:09] haveachub: the original ulduar HMs were a legit challenge...to call that raid easy means you actually never played it lol
[9:03:10] notdustinx: Alyssarazor
[9:03:15] mrsbhappy: new bg map would be nice
[9:03:17] mmo_kenna_: Firelands trash was the worst!
[9:03:17] konoko8: if ulduar came out today in retail wow would you like the raid still? or is it a raid that isnt modernized @Towelliee
[9:03:20] Strifelol: I really enjoyed alysrazor
[9:03:21] Chiphazzord: i liked alisrazor i was our flyer
[9:03:24] james_bah: thunder king was cool too
[9:03:25] Djfarmville: where do you place uldir
[9:03:30] zerihikaru: I bet ice crown was crazy back in the day
[9:03:31] TheOldSchoolRyan: I started watching you when you prog FL @Towelliee
[9:03:31] ascendence94: @Towelliee i think when people say raids like ulduar and sunwell were ez   that thier not taking into account how hard they were for thier time
[9:03:33] GodKingMuninn: Ulduar, BRF, HFC, (Computer set on fire for ToT so didn't get to experience it.) Firelands, then Antoras
[9:03:40] notdustinx: OMG Thunder King was fucking sick
[9:03:47] ripperofbong420: ide be in there
[9:03:48] Beastq8: baleroc
[9:03:48] Velcf: is there a way to fix weakauras because i have a giant thing in the middle of my screen and i cant figure how to get it off?
[9:03:48] Dark_Kornax: @Towelliee I believe that version of "HardMode" was the best.  Unlocking it by capability.  How good your dps was, etc.
[9:03:54] cerealkillas22: I liked the first raid of Cata, BWD  a whole lot
[9:03:54] Heero_Effect: We be guzzling

[9:07:01] MeekPR4L: @dawnovun be safe and be warm
[9:07:02] Fortvila: my fav raid was SoO
[9:07:08] Voltaictv: They posted a lil patch tease on twitter, so probably just doing some final testing
[9:07:11] abracka_: i hope throne of thunder makes it to the MOP timewalking raid
[9:07:15] LoneRangers: Hellfire had some of the best transmog
[9:07:20] NerosCinema: 10 free packs for some reason on Hearthstone if anyone plays that
[9:07:22] GodKingMuninn: BoD was my first time trying mythic raiding. It was enjoyable.
[9:07:24] TheOldSchoolRyan: I was trying to solo BoD you cant do Opulence
[9:07:29] ascendence94: @Towelliee everyone thought battle for mount hyjal was the best Kappa
[9:07:31] Strifelol: The game is so dead people can't wait to get back into the game LUL
[9:07:31] PvtHudson093: I had a blast in Ny'alotha

[9:07:43] tehrobtar: @Towelliee - which addon is it you're using which has all the locations of glyphs, etc. marked on your map? is that tomcat something or another?
[9:07:48] coldarmorTBG: Honestly my fav is the deathwing fight, cant remember the name of the whole raid, but that was the first raid that I actually prgged on.. So really liked it.
[9:07:50] konoko8: If you mad BFA like dragon flight with no mandatory systems i think BFA would be top 4 expansions of all time
[9:07:59] mmo_kenna_: no beers, malt night. Talisker Skye 45.8%
[9:08:00] Moobot:  Guess what? NA Servers are DOWN. DOWN BAD. Towelliee is on EU OR PTR SERVER. NA SERVERS WILL COME UP SOON™ towCopium
[9:08:07] da_j1nx: What about Blackrock Foundry? I loved that raid.
[9:08:08] konoko8: @coldarmorTBG dragon soul dawg
[9:08:14] Strifelol: Corruption was so sick when you actually had access to the corruption gear easily
[9:08:16] cabalish: rarescanner , tomcat
[9:08:16] tehrobtar: lol awesome, thanks - i'll have to get that tonight when i get home lol
[9:08:18] coldarmorTBG: ^
[9:08:27] coldarmorTBG: Couldnt remember lol
[9:08:33] mmo_kenna_: BFA right up there for me
[9:08:37] Chiphazzord: final patch was finally good
[9:08:45] konoko8: I liked BFA first expansion i got CE
[9:08:49] Thoreya: i loved bfa bc i love to grind
[9:08:50] Strifelol: Corruption was badass
[9:08:51] GodKingMuninn: Players don't mind grind systems if they're account wide
[9:08:54] ripperofbong420: the passive gold grind in bfa once you got started was kinda crazy
[9:08:56] Thoreya: but i know wow players want an OW type of game
[9:08:58] mavericks312: you had us in the first half blizz lol
[9:09:02] PvtHudson093: BFA was great if you played it from the start, it wasnt great for those that stopped and then started again
[9:09:04] mmo_kenna_: 8.2 best patch in Wow HISTORY! Mecha and Najz eternal palace
[9:09:04] arcanitejr: @Towelliee Do you have a video to see what order you rank the expansions in?
[9:09:06] gregl__: 60*
[9:09:07] Kanrad: they went to hard on the crafting system for this one

[9:09:14] Reck179: gotta get them infusions
[9:09:14] Chiphazzord: must do sooo many 16s
[9:09:15] mikejensenn24: What timeline is most fun to do lvl up?
[9:09:17] konoko8: But we've had borrowed power since vanilla @Towelliee  it's called gear. We borrow it until the next expansion
[9:09:23] konoko8: or patch actually
[9:09:23] tehrobtar: @GodKingMuninn agreed - or extremely accelerated on alts
[9:09:26] Karn1987: @Towelliee my fav raids are the mc ony then killing 4 demons solo in 06 for Rhok'delar
[9:09:32] cervlol: crafting system feels non grindy when you only play 1 character xd
[9:09:38] GingerGambit: In theory 50 for all 5 sparks
[9:09:39] mmo_kenna_: Im in PUGs struggling with 12s
[9:09:39] Chiphazzord: and 16s are cancer
[9:09:43] cazhually: lollll woahhh
[9:09:46] Chiphazzord: to pug
[9:09:52] CMack_72: gross
[9:09:57] KDhigherthanGPA: sounds like some unholy DK stuff
[9:09:59] The_Marijuana_NA: just spam smbg on 16 bro
[9:10:00] GeloLlama: Would it be better if it was less than 10 or different altogether
[9:10:03] thrust0: That's called a blister ;)
[9:10:04] cabalish: u can see it on the robberto baggio picture
[9:10:08] Karn1987: ]
[9:10:08] KDhigherthanGPA: was it a pustule
[9:10:20] marke44: i mean 10 mplus for guarantied bis aint bad
[9:10:20] Karn1987: hunter bow
[9:10:24] gregl__: or 2 drop per run
[9:10:25] gregl__: whatever
[9:10:27] im_n0t_jezus: yeah no way
[9:10:31] im_n0t_jezus: if ur casual
[9:10:31] Hammerify: getting into +16s is hard too
[9:10:36] Zavier420: @karn1987 I remember the hunter ancient leaf quest
[9:10:36] Hammerify: depending on your job
[9:10:40] Heero_Effect: towBlue HotPokket
[9:10:42] tocu: if you want the food buff you need to do 30
[9:10:47] asmodai4823: @marke44 its not bis tho
[9:10:47] Karn1987: @Towelliee hunter bow
[9:10:50] toocheap2rhyme: fuuuuck servers are still down >:(
[9:10:54] GingerGambit: Let it drop 1-3 and it would be much better
[9:11:02] VanishSHRoguE: are servers not up yet damm
[9:11:04] Fortvila: feels like brood and raza HC should give u the same token as well
[9:11:08] Strifelol: They just need to do what they do with all catch up currency by trading it from your main to your alt
[9:11:18] XadanarGaming: meanwhile your main has 500 primal focus that are worthless
[9:11:20] GeloLlama: Maybe make them account bound?
[9:11:22] marke44: @marke44 it is for many slots
[9:11:26] brooklynitetv: I consider myself a good gamer but 16's are impossible to get into let alone complete pugging
[9:11:29] baja6133: nobody would get invited to 16 with shit gear tho
[9:11:29] flebbooo: NotLikeThis
[9:11:31] banadona: or make it so we can exchange the lesser ones for higher ones at a ratio
[9:11:35] khrovaa: PLZ
[9:11:37] Reck179: PLEASE
[9:11:38] Xeressia: wait, do you have to do it 405 first for a 418?
[9:11:40] kraydom: You can skip straight up to 418 just farm 16s.
[9:11:43] YinYangMan77: See!  Now you're getting it!
[9:11:43] marke44: @marke44 or do you not know about lariet?
[9:11:45] TheGiant99: the thing is most people are not striving for that level loot.....
[9:11:45] snake_like: I think 10 16's for a mythic quality item is pretty fair. idk. primal chaos should be accountwide though
[9:11:46] Snabido: My man tryna theorycraft crafting
[9:11:47] Heero_Effect: You’re account wide :)
[9:11:50] GodKingMuninn: Server list's of realm are rearranging rn
[9:11:51] AZnEriC: server's back up now guys?
[9:11:54] cazhually: i dont think people are playing alts as much
[9:11:54] da_j1nx: Just listening to this makes me feel like I need a PhD to understand these systems
[9:11:58] tocu: @Towelliee every faction when you cap reknown give you  the 405 item
[9:12:01] cazhually: it's kind of lame this grindy system
[9:12:02] asmodai4823: @marke44 lariat is one item
[9:12:08] Strifelol: They can just make it so we can convert them at a 1 to 3 ratio or something
[9:12:11] GodKingMuninn: my home server aint listed anymore, calling it 20 mins tills ervers up
[9:12:12] YinYangMan77: Give my my account-wide renown bars!
[9:12:21] itspokejoe: You can get primal infusion with max renown
[9:12:22] Crizzle777: I can't even level my blacksmithing
[9:12:22] khrovaa: @tocu id rather just do 11's then grind rep
[9:12:24] Hammerify: Getting into the +16s depending on your spec is also a nightmare, imagine taking a not Prot Warrior
[9:12:30] ripperofbong420: i think theyre hesitant to make alts easy to gear so you dont get a 405 healer whos actually a paperweight or something
[9:12:37] drmeatshield: I love the HoV nerfs to boss health after Tyrannical just ended. XD
[9:12:39] AZnEriC: Glad I am still at work for another hour LUL
[9:12:41] Nemosaur: what is the ilvl  required for making a tier piece?
[9:12:46] cazhually: sparks are farmable?
[9:12:47] FrankTizzle: Wait, they will be farmable today?
[9:12:53] smashwow: still a lot of dungeons
[9:12:56] unowncreature: I hate gearing in WoW its so annoying thats why I probably wont go past heroic gear
[9:12:56] MackaRoney: How are Sparks going to be farmable?
[9:12:57] Subbed_No_Ban: I love shit like that
[9:13:18] TheGiant99: @towelliee but how many people actually are pushing to get 418 gear and or need it for the content they do
[9:13:29] brooklynitetv: I thought completing faction rep gave you 418?
[9:13:30] Moobot:  Guess what? NA Servers are DOWN. DOWN BAD. Towelliee is on EU OR PTR SERVER. NA SERVERS WILL COME UP SOON™ towCopium
[9:13:45] LoneRangers: Why is it you arent playing classic uld if it was your favorite?
[9:13:51] LostCleric: I ran a few 16's before reset last night. The difference in having a warrior tank  rather then a BM was night and day. Do I mind? Hell no, Warrior gang.
[9:13:52] FrankTizzle: I thought they will just be accessible faster (like charge catalyst
[9:13:54] Pallyofhell: farm rares daily
[9:14:03] GingerGambit: @brooklynitetv only 405
[9:14:04] drmeatshield: completing rep is only 405 :/
[9:14:12] the_inhumanatee: im stuck on retrieving realm list, CHANGES ARE HAPPENING!
[9:14:22] toocheap2rhyme: so were not limited to 2 pieces crafted gear equipped anymore?
[9:14:25] Crizzle777: yea I want 418 gear but realistically, I probably will quit soon
[9:14:38] turfjitsu: you just got them good eyes dude
[9:14:40] Crizzle777: 390, as a casual player probably good enough
[9:14:44] cabalish: it depends from where u get up there
[9:14:45] alantin77: na your already 1/2 way up the mountain
[9:14:48] th_e_on: yesssss
[9:14:54] dannyis1337: same here
[9:14:57] turfjitsu: nice n clean
[9:14:58] LuiBMHunter: it's all the players landing on the peak - wearing it away
[9:15:00] PvtHudson093: im with you on that
[9:15:04] XadanarGaming: Gearing should feel tough in order to make it rewarding but it shuldnt feel bad. Like going through a whole raid without getting a piece of loot when personal loot was a thing or doing 5 M+ and not getting a single piece to drop. The biggest pain point is M+ gearing 2 piece of loot for 5 people after killing 5 bosses is feelsbadman
[9:15:07] TheGiant99: D4 and WOW will be second tier for me

[9:46:46] JasperCalico: @gGhote yes
[9:46:50] coldarmorTBG: Is MT coming this patch?
[9:47:02] DuhCasual: @gGhote ty
[9:47:11] MetalJoshP: with this expansion seeing how a lot of focus went away from the "systems' id like to see more class like warlock green fire stuff come into the game, maybe druids can learn through quests the different bear, cat, balance and travel forms out in the world. warlock able to "tame" demons, etc stuff like that that would really open up the class  fantasy and lore
[9:47:12] BobLongMVP: @neverbornlucky imo, no.
[9:47:19] Kaydwen: @coldarmorTBG Yes
[9:47:20] faulen: has it been extended yet?
[9:47:20] LJimbox: didnt they have it scheduled until 3pm PST anyway?
[9:47:26] JasperCalico: they have to update millions of rows in a database. it just takes time
[9:47:40] BobLongMVP: I’d bet it’s related to guild chat/communities/bnet platform. Shit is so busted
[9:47:41] aztec8669: What is trail of style?
[9:47:44] Zkx_: They said 8 hours it’s been 6.5 so
[9:47:46] Synaerio: i would LOVE class fantasy stuff
[9:47:47] grumpyunclecritter: big pink floating boxes ... like lich king
[9:47:48] Pallyofhell: so more of everyone gets an ashbringer
[9:47:55] RayRay_wow: Is this a better pug week than last week in m+?
[9:47:55] hisdue: someone say class fantasy? give druids another form
[9:48:08] Sylphy_TV: Undead Druid When
[9:48:13] Sollice: I think Blizzard is trying to do that with Trading Post and transmog on more items.
[9:48:14] fire_fawkes: dragon flying form
[9:48:14] Carahail: @skidog813 I mini Holiday where you can play around with transmog.

[9:48:25] shimwood: Pandaren Druid
[9:48:49] MetalJoshP: class fantasy should be in every xpac and or patch it can take uo so much player time and be fun and create more uniqueness to classes and your toon
[9:48:53] GrimMSickles: i want a VULPERA DRUID
[9:48:57] Muggshott: Blue fire for mages to do a "Frostfire" type thing could be neat.
[9:49:56] Red_Dead_Redeem: they should have panda druids
[9:49:56] Moobot:  Guess what? NA Servers are DOWN. DOWN BAD. Towelliee is on EU OR PTR SERVER. NA SERVERS WILL COME UP SOON™ towCopium
[9:50:06] DuhCasual: it drives me nuts that a lot of specs use fire. bad fantasy in my opinion.
[9:50:41] coldarmorTBG: Lol, have you guys seen the banner for the Feral class overview page on WoWhead?
[9:50:42] MetalJoshP: didnt they say they are working on  giving every race every class but the reason it would take time would because of making the uniwue druid forms
[9:50:49] GrimMSickles: lighting mage would be dope
[9:51:12] JasperCalico: @coldarmorTBG LOL thats great
[9:51:20] MetalJoshP: imagine if frost DK was like black ice or something like that
[9:51:21] neverbornlucky: chat when do we go riot on twetter cause servers are not up ? When does the raid start for that

[9:51:44] Muggshott: Oh no, if they're expanding on full specs I want a time mage or a melee arcane gish (not light or fel or elements)
[9:51:45] Synaerio: Change Arcane Mage to a Tank Spec that utilizes defensive magics
[9:51:52] DuhCasual: @GrimMSickles should a mage deal in fire, frost, or light though?
