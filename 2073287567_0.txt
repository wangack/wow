[0:47:58] herraquh: Dive for FREEDOM!
[0:48:00] Tropicocity: Its because nobody knew the game back in early wow, pugging was too difficult to rely on
[0:48:03] Trexbo_: Shruge Maybe the players are also just used to pugging due to retail LFR and such
[0:48:04] deedoo: PUGS in SoD are wild, either bots or hardcore speedrun x % ppl
[0:48:06] thespy123: blizzard said in iterview with preach that over 50% of the player base play solo with no guild/friend so yeah most likely pugs are more used

[0:50:21] herraquh: Will I buy gold or a kebab? Kebab wins every time.
[0:50:21] mibbiix: The problem is: Bots, GDKP's, Boosting, Gold Buying/Selling
[0:50:22] Mr_Moffert: the worst way to feel in a game is feeling that youre wasting your time, and tokens is a prime cuse
[0:50:26] adparticular1: I love bots, free mats in the auction house DANKIES
[0:50:26] Fujinator: all games are pay 2 win to a certain degree nowadays

[0:50:42] layziep: I work 7 days a week the only thing I have time to do is watch other people play MMOs :D
[0:50:42] deedoo: I earn my retail gold by boosting in M+ so essentialy i get RMT gold
[0:50:46] Kazay1998: @Mr_Moffert Very good take
[0:50:49] jimzan1: Then play another game
[0:50:49] Kleipd: @Nikoftz27 PepeNPC AH
[0:50:51] Norcore: @madslilliedallarsen LOL what are you on about? have you ever looked at trade chat?
[0:50:52] Roughneck0: i look at it like my time is worth more that the cost of gold
[0:50:55] sjukungen1: time is limiting factor always :( we getting old
[0:50:58] primisus69: dont be a player be a payer
[0:51:01] Grocery7: retail has boosting instead of GDKP
[0:51:03] wolf79x: retail is just boost runs
[0:51:04] arrkies91: taking away GDKP is the best blizz done for years
[0:51:05] F1reline: Someone can get a super valuable item with pure luck as well, life is never fair :p

[0:51:15] Domebuddy: @deedoo i made millions selling argus kills
[0:51:16] vepsee: retail is way better in that way, gold is borderline useless outside of boosts
[0:51:16] Norcore: retail trade chat is literally endless GDKP / boost spam om
[0:51:18] wolf79x: its gdkp just u dont bid lmao
[0:51:18] Grocery7: arena/raid/M+ boosts in retail
[0:51:20] skrakampf: with group loot back in retail im sure there are GDKPs
[0:51:21] BWAttila: absolutely not, I have to contradict you here... there are different aspects of the game, some are enjoyable some not. You don't play a game because you love all aspects. If you want to focus on one than why not?
[0:51:21] TheWhiteRabbitxX: AsmonGold went over this a lot how the token monetized everything in the game
[0:51:22] Trexbo_: Boost how? Level or what?
[0:51:27] Fujinator: also, if you are geared out, people will think you p2w even if you didnt either way.
[0:51:33] Stingin: The value of the game gets removed when you have pay to win features
[0:51:40] wolf79x: @Trexbo_ u pay gold u get all the drops from a raid

[2:00:25] yngvez: i usually wouldnt watch videos unless they were reacted to, dunno about anyone else
[2:00:25] Trexbo_: YEP When Guzu actually engages with the points in the video, I think that's valid.
[2:00:26] TacomaWeppt: it 100% is regardless of how you do it, but does that make it wrong, thats the real question
[2:00:27] H1manu: @Guzu Have you seen iAsk https://clips.twitch.tv/ColorfulBovineCookieMoreCowbell-ez2Tyl6u5q0HnApY ???

[2:01:48] Seoken1: The creators often forget that often the streamer will bring in a new audience that is unfamiliar with them, AKA they wouldn't have watched the video otherwise
[2:01:50] TacomaWeppt: i know the act man had to have a talk with asmon behind the scenes about him reacting so quickly to his vids, but he said it was amicable
[2:01:53] zargo333: adding just commentary is not much but the sad reallity is that people like seeing the reaction or opinion of someone else on things

[2:04:45] MikkiDevan: Can any1 tell me, if they made a version of AtlassLoot for SoD?
[2:04:46] EssemTV: I wish youtube had a "react" category for videos and you would link the video your reacting to, so when someone watches that video both videos will get the view
[2:04:49] viciouswx: Any publicity is good publicity

[3:29:57] Trexbo_: Esfand MMORPG streamer nominee doesnt even play MMORPGs om
[3:29:58] Nunadaaa: I think he lives his life in gta 6 now other than that he eats and sleeps irl
[3:29:58] Trexbo_: ICANT
[3:30:04] Furuluru: im happy me and my friends chose pve server. If we want to pvp we go bg or stv - no griefs
[3:30:04] twitch4home007: esfand gave up on wow?
[3:30:07] viciouswx: I love this game
[3:30:08] mikkelssen: same man
[3:30:11] Arcinatos: people go to pvp realms for the pop
[3:30:17] Rocksteady22: ppl go there to follow streamers, otherwise youll be on a dead srver
[3:30:20] JoeBangles_: Imagine being a normie
[3:30:29] nebunu88: what server u`re playing?
[3:30:35] thefoxborough69: By de loa ABOBA
[3:30:36] Cruzix__: @Guzu Playing on PvE is just odd though, not being able to attack opposite faction at times
[3:30:38] saren_x: only cowards and noobs play on pve servers guzul
[3:30:40] peltsiii95: its not fun on pve servers at time either since its 70/30 alliance
[3:30:42] nebunu88: same
[3:30:45] nebunu88: it feels dead
[3:30:49] xelm_: i like PvE tbh.
[3:30:53] SirHeiska: @guzu Paladin with attacks is too easy and boring for Esfand.
[3:30:54] viciouswx: I'm on rp non pvp server and it's great. Still lots of pvp and pop
[3:30:59] Traitmark: I go PvP server cause i feel it's part of the game, even though i usually don't initiate battles
[3:31:08] Marhazad: ganker Guzu
[3:31:10] xelm_: constantly getting ganked. savixHalt
[3:31:13] Dinomight3: it is
[3:31:15] Rebukenx: the game is called world of "war"craft
[3:31:16] AzureClaw: my friends demanded to play pvp server despite how much i hate it, not a month into P1 and they all stopped playing.
[3:31:18] xelm_: yeah
[3:31:18] maxburty: you played a rogue YEP
[3:31:20] twitch4home007: classic wow already doesn’t respect your time and then you throw pvp ganking on top of it? lol
[3:31:21] sickish: PvE servers can be so wholesome.
[3:31:22] 1cxlo: yep
[3:31:22] mibbiix: Pvp sucks. Pve is better since it's something you can control. Pvp you just get ganked if you're leveling
[3:31:22] Blufootgaming: Duel THIS
[3:31:23] AzureClaw: now i'm stuck her hating life
[3:31:23] BLGFish: When you don't have as much time to play playing on PVP server is just a headache
[3:31:24] Trexbo_: You went from stream sniper to being stream sniped, suddenly you understood why om
[3:31:26] AdamShwaginz: I just enjoy leveling uninterrupted cozy vibes

[3:31:27] Boneyards_666: do elden ring pvp
[3:31:29] StripSniper: dude PVE is so good, STV event made it so you can pvp in the world without being too invested
[3:31:32] b4ck13: says the rogue
[3:31:33] saren_x: I do like the danger it adds YEP
[3:31:33] turtlemun: PvP gives me massive anxiety spikes so I can't play that gamemode at all
[3:31:36] 7osei: world pvp is rarely a fair fight and that's why i dont really enjoy it that much anymore
[3:31:37] Djinx_o: world "PvP" is 99% Ganking
[3:31:37] Huertix: I never get attacked by people of my level on pvp, only 4+ levels over
[3:31:38] Boneyards_666: guzuYump guzuYump guzuYump
[3:31:38] Furuluru: the ease of no griefs is nice
[3:31:44] DJspookyghost: i like pressing imp. blizzard on big clumps of players :)
[3:31:44] krabbstek: It's really fun in pve when you can help other faction and /nod respectfully afterwards
[3:31:47] Quillmane: right. all pvp servers ended up with 99% vs 1% faction wise. at least on pve you still get to see the other faction.

[3:31:56] Cruzix__: @Guzu It's not really about the active world pvp hunt, more so the option to be able to attack oppposite faction when they "steal" ur stuff etc
[3:31:59] xelm_: @saren_x i respect it. its the orginal way to play WoW. i just hated being like lvl 15 and lvl 60s killing u in starting zones.
[3:31:59] mandotweet: no one in pvp servers chill and duel in goldshire. thats why normal servers are the best @Guzu
