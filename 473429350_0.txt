[11:50:25] streamelementstips: Do you think there's a lot of people playing Classic just because it's a trend and not because they're actually interested in the game?
[11:50:35] dium: With hotfixes that we are currently deploying to all WoW Classic realms, we are substantially increasing the number of players that can be simultaneously logged in and playing. We expect this to result in smaller queues for realms that have large queues, and some realms should no longer have queues at all. We will closely monitor performance and stability throughout this process. Thank you very much.
