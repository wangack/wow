[0:22:00] nnooiizz: one thing i dislike about rpg is that when you hit a mob there a feeling of a disconnect to an actual fight scene. It's like hitting sandbags and sandbags don't fight back.
[0:22:00] rato_de_esgoto88: Shadowlands had beautiful zones and music, but everyone hated it because they just care about the instanced end game stuff, so its not what most ppl want.
[0:22:02] XCaptivehonorX: @shroud  maybe its kinda like Skyrim
[0:22:16] Cloudladder: ye

[1:00:58] gmpatton99: @Paani it was a fresh blade, but happens almost any time i use my sr
[1:01:16] gmpatton99: electric razors dont cause me any problems, but im going out later and wanted a smooth face LUL
[1:01:23] PaypalPatel: whats the addon that has the black outline on his bars
[1:01:37] puntos97: not centered :o
[1:01:50] itsYeom: do you buy WoW just 1 time to play it forever?
[1:02:01] gmpatton99: @abra4kadabra i think its like a subscription
[1:02:01] Bluffz: suiiiiiiiii
[1:02:11] DJ_VS: @abra4kadabra its a subscription base 15/mo
[1:02:20] puntos97: @abra4kadabra 13 euro/month
[1:02:27] Vtergo: 15 a month and you have to pay $40 for the newest expansion
[1:02:33] Vtergo: or if you just play classic its just 15 a month
[1:02:33] itsYeom: oh okay. so yeah, I can't afford to play it for now. lol
[1:03:01] imMikeyAngelo: catJAM
[1:03:04] chungus_ult: all cd's on this first mob LFG
[1:03:05] gmpatton99: @Vtergo bruh thats such a rip off, any other mmo ive played the sub gives you everything for the month
[1:03:10] chandleriab: buuut if you have alot of gold, gametime is free
[1:03:13] destryan_: new expac base edition is $50
[1:03:19] gene_parmesan_: @shroud IM GOING BACK TO RET PALLY
[1:03:24] Vtergo: @SeguaceGP yea i agree i think wow needs to either get rid of sub or make expansions free
[1:03:29] Hexereye99: 13euros isnt that much tho tbh
[1:03:50] fournn__: i our song shroud
[1:04:00] birdybird6: @Hexereye99 shhh before they hear you and raise it to 20
[1:04:17] gmpatton99: @Hexereye99 lets make it 30, time to double the price
[1:04:19] LucidAntics: @Vtergo How is that a ripoff when titles like CoD charge 70 bucks for a "remastered" game lmao
[1:04:25] Gbirdz: is this classic?

[1:05:00] Aspire121: @Vtergo why are all the other mmos that do that are not as successful as wow
[1:05:01] gmpatton99: @LucidAntics cause any other mmo includes expansions in the monthly sub, but if your sub expires then expansion is gone, having to pay another 40 on top of the monthly sub is a rip off
[1:05:09] LucidAntics: Shit i bet there's a few of you in here that remember back when maintenance would take 1 or 2 days and they'd pay us back in game time LULW

[1:05:13] Vtergo: @LucidAntics dont get me wrong cod is a rip off too lmaooo, but i just think wow needs to pick 2 monitization methods rather than all 3... in game shop, sub, or pay for xpacs
[1:05:15] Vtergo: pick 2
[1:05:19] Vtergo: but wow has all 3
[1:05:20] Vtergo: :(
[1:05:29] LucidAntics: @SeguaceGP literally no other mmo offers their latest expansion with their sub cost. literally not a single one. at all. literally ever.
[1:05:32] pmillz88: because it still can afford too
[1:05:39] Drukae: @SeguaceGP which are you talking about?
[1:05:45] gmpatton99: @SeguaceGP yes they do lol, swtor, dcuo, literally any other mmo
[1:05:50] chandleriab: WoW also has a fuck ton of content
[1:05:50] itsYeom: lol 13 euros in so much if converted in our currency. lmao
[1:05:57] Cnith: @LucidAntics pretty much only happened when it first came out in vanilla with the ton of instabilities the servers had that. At least in EU
[1:05:59] footslave_: @vtergo if wow goes f2p it will be ruined
[1:06:06] Vtergo: i know becuase bots
[1:06:11] Vtergo: im not saying f2p
[1:06:16] blueeyedzombiekid: I remember that
[1:06:17] LucidAntics: @SeguaceGP bro no they dont and swtor is a TERRIBLE example for this lol. Destiny 2? nope gotta pay even though it's f2p. ff14? nope gotta pay even though you pay a sub.
[1:06:19] Spartcus195: if it was longer than like half a day it would just get added to the end of your game time.

[1:06:55] ewbrad: @wahlbang The Kill - 30 seconds to mars
[1:06:57] chandleriab: WoW will never do anything about bots. It's pretty easy to make one and would only get caught if the bot is stuck in one position

[1:07:23] gmpatton99: @LucidAntics read before you speak
[1:07:27] gmpatton99: or type
[1:07:38] gene_parmesan_: pretty sure ret pally BIS list is none of their tier pieces? @shroud

[1:07:54] LucidAntics: @SeguaceGP those are 2 examples, and you suggested that EVERY mmo offers expansions with sub cost. just please stop buddy LULW and you're comparing swtor to WoW LUL
[1:08:00] gmpatton99: @SeguaceGP still mmos, still comparable,
[1:08:09] imMikeyAngelo: They buffed ulduar gear
[1:08:09] LucidAntics: no theyre not comparable at all LULW
[1:08:12] xStormyzx: 10m tier is 225 25m tier is 232
[1:08:13] gmpatton99: theyre mmos

[1:09:05] gene_parmesan_: facts but still the tier pieces are low, 10m gear might be better without 2 - 4 piece set
[1:09:07] Spartcus195: @ewbrad if youre a healer haha
[1:09:14] gmpatton99: @Drukae nah just because you dont like them doesnt mean they suck, swtor still a top 20 mmo on playerbase alone

[4:24:49] SweetMcPwnSauce94: @essSe7en classic is much slower pace than retail. so if u like slow go for classic. if u like zooming play retail.
[4:26:18] Pandorozza: :D :D

[4:28:36] sirsmokesalot8807: is WoW even worth it anymore??? I stopped playing during Wrath of the Litch King... I tried to get back into a couple years ago but its not even the same game anymore...
[4:29:25] aarseths: @sirsmokesalot8807 Did you expect it to stay the same for 10 years? xd yes its worth it, best its been in years
[4:29:28] DollaDSheets: When did dungeon helper addons start appearing? where they out already for wotlk?
[4:29:29] ksmac3: @sirsmokesalot8807 im enjoying this new expac a lot
[4:29:38] ksmac3: DF is on par with Wrath id say so far
[4:29:45] comethazinee_: i started after 10 years with dragonflight
[4:29:46] UnknownDemon: @sirsmokesalot8807 im the same. Stopped after ICC raids and came back for dragonflight and I enjoy it
[4:29:49] comethazinee_: and i really enjoy it
[4:29:57] MARK5_: good game
[4:30:09] SweetMcPwnSauce94: DF is so ez to get into also very friendly for people who cant or dont want to game 8hours per day
[4:30:23] comethazinee_: Ultra alt friendly aswell
[4:30:56] mezinanya: chat is this the hardest boss in ulduar?
[4:30:59] aarseths: Big reason is that its not time consuming at all. you just log on and do whatever you want to, no timegated or required stuff to do everyday.
[4:31:29] moojito: it's nice to be wiping again on occasion
[4:31:35] SweetMcPwnSauce94: its not that its they buff and nerf to much but its early in the Xpac so its obvious it will be like this until everything kinda settles @Boone696
[4:32:00] sirsmokesalot8807: that's why i quit lol, it was consuming my life

[4:37:38] beepingnoise: you guys need max
[4:38:10] sirsmokesalot8807: JUST MY OPINION!!! but since they merged the servers together the game has not been the same for me, I know it makes it feel more populated but changes the total feeling of the game for me

[8:57:40] Spreadi: retri in classic is fun
[8:58:05] Lightsbreath: Btw you don't really need "divine purpose" - the ret talent you picked, you can put these points into something else, aura mastery is big
[8:58:08] Brothersalonika: good old raids

[8:59:24] bombfirrhe: still got your naxx 40 gear on your shaman?
[8:59:27] Spreadi: i think its mostly about how the combat feels for me
[8:59:32] Spreadi: i dont care about the dps so much
[8:59:49] Spreadi: ofc u have to be able to compete but ofc u can always hang in there
[9:00:02] modshaters: @Spreadi wtolk paladin not only retri just OP, just OP in every aspect

[9:24:30] Dicerecovery: Just stack with melee and zerg
[9:24:31] MysticalOS: btw I pushed an update DBM to fix hard mode timer for this boss earlier tonight.
[9:24:33] RedNuker: something mana, something don't kill that thing
[9:24:35] water_0_0: jump in puddles

[9:24:40] brodycanuck: Get bosses health to 0
[9:24:41] Justintuck1: Run into the clouds
[9:24:43] Fistedqt: stand in puddle for mana

[9:25:01] pekkarince: Nothing for melee here just need to kick the cast @shroud
[9:25:07] EatinHashbrowns: dont kill saronite vapors
[9:25:07] Justintuck1: Run into clouds
[9:25:10] Fistedqt: you cant kill the clouds for hard mode
[9:25:15] MysticalOS: don't kill saronite vapors, and an add spawns at 249 seconds into fight
[9:25:17] shadyxwxw: hard mode = dont kill adds
[9:25:20] MysticalOS: and that has to be killed too
[9:25:20] trimezz: it was groot
[9:25:30] Dicerecovery: Yeah the way you do hard mode is not kill any saronites
[9:25:44] Fistedqt: @shroud also run out if you get Mark of the Faceless debuff
[9:25:45] MysticalOS: hard mode is mana management cause no recovering it, not fun for ret or prot paladins
[9:26:01] VallanTV: Did they even talk about interrupts?
[9:26:05] Dicerecovery: This fight is ass for healers

[9:31:27] goodtalk10: There is another pool that restores mana for healers
[9:31:27] Spreadi: he knows what he's doing
[9:31:40] eskodas: When I healed this back in classic I preferred bear tank
[9:31:46] Spreadi: thats actually harder than it seems
[9:31:51] Spreadi: this guy has it down
[9:32:02] EatinHashbrowns: dk is technically bis tank on this because of their super high threat to keep it off locks pumping with the buff
[9:32:17] Spreadi: but the leader is chill still
[9:32:22] Dicerecovery: @pekkarince true, but our blood just went frost last night since it was more dps than the bear going feral or the warr going fury
[9:32:44] StreamElements: Check out Mike's Instagram account - http://www.instagram.com/shroud :D
[9:33:04] pekkarince: @druidishtv yeah ofc warr need more gear to pump
[9:33:08] StarBreaker74: CoolStoryBob CoolStoryBob CoolStoryBob
[9:33:11] Asparagus93: eskodas yea bears are great at tanking this, big hp pool makes it feel less bursty and they can barkskin every surge

[9:36:41] StreamElements: @TinoFromRose, Looking for his sensitivity for a specific game? Type the game name and sens - like !valorantsens or !apexsens
[9:36:41] tha_wicked: like 10 people talking over ghazzy the whole time and now everyone is clueless and has no idea what to do LUL

[9:37:45] Factoray: @Spreadi im with u on that cheers!
[9:37:49] Spreadi: the boss got tired

[9:38:08] tedstickel: lol , this is great
[9:38:08] chilemangx: lol
[9:38:11] ChubbyMikey: @StraightiLLin rarely
[9:38:11] chilemangx: that arms war is a team player
[9:38:14] Lightsbreath: ye, it's a stun+interrupt read the spell
[9:38:20] Lightsbreath: you don't stun but interrupt
[9:38:21] StraightiLLin: @ChubbyMikey sadface
[9:38:22] snuzzling: its stun + interrupt
[9:38:23] SONII: @flashyxakx I made this raid dip shit
[9:38:27] Fuzzywuggums: rest the spell
[9:38:29] Spreadi: NO
[9:38:31] SONII: KEKW
[9:38:38] JJayten: tier d sadge
[9:38:47] Lightsbreath: @shroud it's a stun+interrupt ^^, it will immune the stun but will interrupt
[9:38:47] Spreadi: just no
[9:38:47] Dicerecovery: @SONII I'm dying brooo lmfao
[9:38:49] remorka: SONI BIG D GIGACHAD
[9:39:01] tedstickel: so... they dont know the fight ?
[9:39:04] Fistedqt: it only increases the damage of your casted spells i think
[9:39:09] TocaRed: FeelsStrongMan
[9:39:18] Fistedqt: not all attacks
[9:39:32] logsnar: We couldn‚Äôt kill this MF last night his health pool is nutty
[9:39:49] wubbster_: wubbster_ is continuing the Gift Sub they got from monoxide75! 
[9:39:52] Dicerecovery: General Vez is also the worst to wipe on cause the run back is probably the longest
[9:39:57] Spreadi: hmh
[9:39:58] eskodas: They don‚Äôt realize how much of a circus it becomes when the Animus comes out
[9:40:09] simstarx: @flashyxakx @SONII i can see that
[9:40:13] Spreadi: are u skiled enought!
[9:40:20] Fistedqt: either way I believe those shadow crashes only hit range
[9:40:30] Spreadi: ppl get angry!
[9:40:43] Spreadi: rablerable
[9:40:43] Omni35: you can bring the boss to like 250k
[9:40:45] pulu_322: u r not prepared!
[9:40:52] toshkee_fps: !monitor
[9:40:52] StreamElements: He uses the ASUS ROG Swift 360Hz 27" Gaming Monitor https://bit.ly/3NepLdk
[9:41:10] Spreadi: the power killed u
[9:41:19] logsnar: Shadow should only go to range
[9:41:21] Spreadi: too much power
[9:41:21] DenaliEU: You bring the boss down as much as you can because when the animus spawns you get a stacking shadow dmg debuff, Lower the boss is the easier he gets taken down after the animus dies. OFC you don't want to be going into the hard mode with no mana,
[9:41:23] MysticalOS: they are over thinking damage, just don't dps if not in a crash, and dps should solve itself. and don't play mana inefficent specs like arcane.
[9:41:38] Omni35: shadow crash is targeted towards range but can hit melee if no one is in ranged
[9:41:57] Spreadi: i've drank like 0,7l of 32%
[9:42:07] Spreadi: i'm drunk now
[9:42:16] crackfrog: @MysticalOS tbh good arcane mages can sustain there mana pretty decent
[9:42:42] Fistedqt: you're dpsing your liver :)
[9:42:44] Eclair23: Greasy keyboard gang
[9:42:49] logsnar: What does the tank do if they get mark.
[9:42:51] Spreadi: yes but we must give space to other ppl in the chat too digi
[9:42:59] Dicerecovery: only dps in the black pool on the ground for range
[9:43:00] DenaliEU: The vapors spawning is a timed event, X spawns and it creates into the hard mode boss and buffs the main boss to become immune (90% reduced dmg taken), Also Tanks/Melee CAN get a shadow crash you just need to move a good bit away from the boss, Kinda uncommon for that to happen tho
[9:43:09] Dicerecovery: otherwise its a waste of mana
[9:43:17] SONII: chat who would win in a fight
[9:43:19] SONII: goku or naruto
[9:43:22] deekseverywhere: me
[9:43:24] shadowperfects: you
[9:43:25] tedstickel: why cant we all , just get along .

[9:43:28] Dicerecovery: @SONII goku ez
[9:43:29] „Åã„Åö„Å®: is this classic?
[9:43:30] drizz_: Gokuto
[9:43:31] SylarSavage: @SONII One punch man :)
[9:43:31] MysticalOS: @crackfrog i mean they can, but in early proc, ie week 1 ilvl, mages should be frost so they can go balls to walland be top 2 damage for a longer pull, go arcane or fire when fight is shorter later weeks...but it'll prob die either way if people play right.
[9:43:31] brotheryup: that one guys wife
[9:43:37] StraightiLLin: ultra instinct too stronk
[9:43:39] SONII: @sylarsavage wasnt an option MAN
[9:43:39] MysticalOS: prog*
[9:43:41] tha_wicked: goku
[9:43:44] ChubbyMikey: everyone loses, because anime sucks
[9:43:46] snuzzling: Rimiru Tempest would beat any of em
[9:43:46] Eclair23: Make sense that Shroud doesnt like seasoning on his food, lets go champ
[9:43:49] SylarSavage: @SONII One punch is always an option! Lol
[9:43:52] fafa_don2x: what are they waiting?

[9:45:22] jordansquid: WeebsIn
[9:45:24] snuzzling: Is Fish Feast still the #1 Shareable Platter chat?
[9:45:28] Dicerecovery: @SONII Goku's power is totally raw, whereas Naruto is kinda using borrowed power in a sense from the nine tails righT?
[9:45:32] Fistedqt: do you keep your passive mp5 mana regen on this fight? or do you legit regen 0 mana
[9:45:33] StraightiLLin: I want a fish filet
[9:45:38] yaboiseacat: Is that throat goat shroud???!
[9:45:39] Omni35: just don't cast without a pool SeemsGood
[9:45:43] Spreadi: fish feast?
[9:45:54] ballerusk92: Nerd
[9:45:54] SylarSavage: @DruidishTV YOu do know Naruto has a immense amount of power WITHOUT the nine tails right?
[9:46:01] crackfrog: @MysticalOS imean ur not wrong frost is superior on longer fights , and yea it will die anyways im pretty sure either way
[9:46:13] drizz_: since when does naruto get a pokemon? Kappa
[9:46:24] shadowfocus_dota2: General Vezax General Vezax's Hard Mode is triggered by allowing all 6 Saronite Vapors to spawn without killing them while Vezax is still alive. A Saronite Animus will spawn. The Animus makes Vezax immune to damage with Saronite Barrier. While the barrier is up, Vezax will not cast Searing Flames. Defeating the Animus will drop the barrier and make Vezax vulnerable again.
[9:46:24] StraightiLLin: vegeta could defeat naruto, let alone GOKU
[9:46:25] MysticalOS: choo choo
[9:46:28] snuzzling: Naruto got a stand
[9:46:30] Spreadi: wait what
[9:46:32] duuuuuy: Who caught up with Boruto ?? Naruto weakkk

[9:46:38] holdmeloveme: jeeenkins
[9:46:43] Spreadi: i loved narut
[9:46:46] Spreadi: naruto
[9:46:56] crackfrog: @MysticalOS but also im just a warlock i dont care about mana xD
[9:46:57] Spreadi: never watched boruto more than a few eps

[9:47:17] duuuuuy: @Spreadi The anime is dumbbb. The manga is good cause it's more canon
[9:47:19] Dicerecovery: @sylarsavage oh for sure, but are we comparing in their non powered up states?
[9:47:26] debindra: Age of Empires 2 is better than this game
[9:47:28] Spreadi: mm i see
[9:47:34] shadowperfects: lol
[9:47:43] StraightiLLin: @DruidishTV what's the point of that?
[9:47:52] ChubbyMikey: Age of Empires 2 was a fucking amazing game, true
[9:47:52] steviemcintosh: shroud "i got a 10man after this" LUL
[9:47:54] SylarSavage: @DruidishTV In non powered up state, Naruto technically would most likely win. He's a ninja, and doesn't really have to do much to win. Where as Goku seems to ALWAYS lose in his base form.
[9:47:57] Nevindaz: slootG
[9:48:15] Spreadi: the point of naruto for me was always the bringing up story
[9:48:22] Dicerecovery: @sylarsavage I think I could agree with that
[9:48:24] Spreadi: and they kinda lost the idea of it in the second season
[9:48:25] SylarSavage: @DruidishTV It'd be a WAY better fight if you had them at max power in their CURRENT state.
[9:48:44] debindra: Shroud should play Age of Empires 2
[9:48:52] Spreadi: so shippuuden was only for to see how powerful he comes
[9:48:53] Kalel420: is this vault raid?
[9:48:58] CooperChenn: Leeroy
[9:49:18] Jirshua: did someone complain about their parse
[9:49:22] J_uss: i love u shrood
[9:49:25] SylarSavage: @Spreadi You should really skip to the newest season of Boruto. He becomes insane.
[9:49:26] Jirshua: so sad lol...
[9:49:37] uhomer9030: lul
[9:49:39] SylarSavage: @Spreadi naruto becomes insane not Boruto lol
[9:49:41] Spreadi: yea but i dont care about that really
[9:49:41] Jirshua: mmo players are sussss

[9:50:44] POGGAROOSREVENGE: wtf weird ass chatter
[9:50:47] sheriffqlo: lych king? classic?
[9:51:02] Spreadi: i loved naruto when i saw it first because of the fact that he was an outcast that decided to become something
[9:51:12] Dicerecovery: He's definitely been drinking and smoking so I'm not surprised lol
[9:51:19] Spreadi: and all that lost meaning in the later stuff
[9:51:20] MysticalOS: DBM has a timer for the hard mode, but only if you have tonights update I released to fix pre timer to pre nerf. old version shows the post nerf hard mode timer.
[9:51:24] SylarSavage: @Spreadi Well in Boruto, he is the Hokage, AND still the strongest ninja
[9:51:26] CooperChenn: The tension is real
[9:51:28] crackfrog: @Fistedqt na its just wotlk mentality xD
[9:51:28] ballerusk92: You guild sucks, I have 500 days played in wow. Trust me bro
[9:51:29] toxickanser: imagine complaining about "interracial population" in a game with 14 races dude wtf LUL
[9:51:33] DenaliEU: I'm guessing this guild don't really watch tacts etc.. And just mess around until they figure it out?
[9:51:33] brodycanuck: Kappa
[9:51:37] drizz_: i like how it take a minute for degens to get banned in here because nobody acknowledges their crap
[9:51:37] riptack69: -10 in quebec rn

[9:57:56] Dicerecovery: I had like 6% mana as a holy pally at the end of this fight, just had to flash of light more often
[9:57:56] drizz_: Marc jacob? LUL
[9:58:11] MysticalOS: if mark and crash happen at same time, the crash target scan gets a little wonky sadly
[9:58:21] Spreadi: so is it just like a big dps check
[9:58:27] Spreadi: this boss
[9:58:46] logsnar: Yeah focus macro kick
[9:59:00] ArcherDrM: how u guys doing mythic vault then failing on here
[9:59:04] Dextergg: I wonder if you can afford to drop a healer for a dps. Boss was pretty low with vapor
[9:59:07] ArcherDrM: this is like 10 times easier
[9:59:13] Spreadi: hmm so what happens there
[9:59:15] tymeo0404: SabaPing

[10:06:27] MysticalOS: Just pushed a cocde update to vezex in DBM to be more thorough in shadow crash target scan if it looks like it's on mark target, it'll wait a few more milli seconds to be sure both on same target. :)

[10:07:08] Shaakzzx: Just have Ska do wisdom and you do light and you'll get the mana back from the talent no?
[10:07:36] Spreadi: oh is there like a limit to the mana that triggers the boss??
[10:07:41] Spreadi: i'm so confused
[10:08:20] Spreadi: what triggers the killing mode
[10:08:21] Zintration: @Niahlistt no they do 24/24/23
[10:08:21] itsTPrecision: the one handed rotation LUL
[10:08:36] DealerMDL: @Spreadi hard mode is not kill vapors that give mana to players

[10:09:27] pulu_322: peak ret pala wow wotlk pov
[10:09:34] DealerMDL: fight is tough coz theres no other way to get mana and they cant kill vapors
[10:09:43] Quantum733: because two hands are for nerds
[10:10:03] Spreadi: so what triggers the rage mode on boss
[10:10:13] Spreadi: or berserk
[10:10:18] zev319: shroud go back there and dance for fun
[10:10:22] dquasar: @shroud Interface - Combat - Healing
[10:10:24] dwayz_official: @Spreadi a timmer for berserk
[10:10:30] DealerMDL: berserk is just a timer, they have that time to kill boss or they wipe
[10:10:31] Spreadi: aaaah
[10:10:35] JerseyBricklayer: imagine going into a stream and crapping on someones fun
[10:10:39] Spreadi: so they just fight too long
[10:10:42] Spreadi: basicly
[10:10:53] Omni35: wotlk makes melee patchwork fights a lot

[10:11:58] Spreadi: and hard modes
[10:12:00] Spreadi: are boring

[10:13:25] Spreadi: how can it be any different
[10:13:47] braisertv: Shroud ur water
[10:13:47] Zintration: @shroud if u go to details options and go to "bars:general" at the top u can check off "always show me" so chat can see how much u pumpin
[10:13:48] Spreadi: its not like there are mechanics :D its just u bounding a big dude and not getting it done
[10:13:51] sal_rl: @MimikzTV Like 2x harder, this was the first actually hard raid in wow with real hardmodes
[10:13:52] Lohth: It‚Äôs just like iron council, boring first half then super hard finish
[10:13:53] Spreadi: thats that.
[10:13:54] brokenlimb: @shroud are the hunters trapping?
[10:14:04] dquasar: @shroud Interface - Combat - Healing
[10:14:08] Fistedqt: it is more difficult because they cant kill the only source of mana regen
[10:14:09] itzzmonday: shroud4Head
[10:14:19] MimikzTV: @sal_rl ah,prenerf sunwell was fun so thats exciting
[10:14:30] Spreadi: so how does mana regen affect this boss?
[10:14:35] Spreadi: does it heal it?
[10:14:39] dahlstroemp: @shroud Tems ulduar weakaura pack is out, you should check it out!

[10:14:53] how2fail101: The keybindings look like its a whole dif language like wth lol
[10:15:01] Fistedqt: so you have to kill the boss before your casters run out of mana
[10:15:05] Spreadi: ok so the boss kills your mana regen
[10:15:06] Omni35: you don't even need range for this fight
[10:15:12] Spreadi: and u cant do damages

[10:16:53] yungfleezy: are yall doing hard mode?
[10:16:54] Spreadi: i have always hated the guys in the LFR stuff that tell me how i messed up but never ever tell me what i did wrong
[10:17:00] Zintration: @shroud if u go to details options and go to "bars:general" at the top u can check off "always show me" so chat can see how much u pumpin
[10:17:05] KralovnyKral: yes its hard mode
[10:17:06] andros299: Which class do you enjoy the most?
[10:17:13] Omni35: range is irrelevant besides the hard enrage which I think is a really long time.
[10:17:14] Spreadi: talk people!
[10:17:18] Fistedqt: your locks should definitely port out, hunter disengage and anyone else rocket boot when they get mark of the faceless
[10:17:25] Dadillac_: turn  health tiks off
[10:17:30] RedNuker: shroudM
[10:17:34] tha_wicked: hahaha wtf
[10:17:37] Hazengoo: damn he thicc
[10:17:59] smajaga: the 2 step okay coach max KEKW
[10:18:10] Spreadi: so can u avoid the mana drain?
[10:18:14] youhavebeenmislead: tango?
[10:18:31] Fistedqt: @Spreadi there is no mana drain dude you just go oom while doing damage
[10:18:42] Hazengoo: how many bosses in?
[10:18:46] Spreadi: so its a mana drain
[10:18:49] Fistedqt: all you can do is stand in the shadow crash pools to reduce mana costs by 75%
[10:18:51] Cheesysp00fs: yes b c w Ed nyur be
[10:19:01] mikeham91: @Spreadi no the boss prevents mana regen
[10:19:06] Fistedqt: yes if you consider that a mana drain then every boss ever has a mana drain KEKW
[10:19:07] Omni35: the boss increases mana cost of spells doesn't it?
[10:19:17] Spreadi: ok so u have to avoid being avoided :;DD
[10:19:19] Spreadi: haha
[10:19:19] KA15T3R101: HassaanChop
[10:19:19] RedNuker: shroud4Head
[10:19:28] ArcherDrM: no reduces mana cost for those standing in shadow
[10:19:33] beudi: reckH  reckH  reckH
[10:19:35] KINGKUSH905: just leeroy pull it
[10:19:35] komodragonx123: shroud have u ever played gotham city imposters
[10:19:36] Fistedqt: @Omni35 no it just removes any mana regen
[10:19:39] kirogawas: !uptime
[10:19:40] StreamElements: @quirubin1, Mike has been live for:  10 hours 19 mins
[10:19:48] Spreadi: ok so whats the smartest thing to do
[10:20:01] Spreadi: consider me stupid if u havent already
[10:20:10] Spreadi: tell me how
[10:20:16] mikeham91: @spreadi ranged should only cast while standing in  a shadow pool because it reduces mana cost of spells, the raid avoiding any damage possible is important to save healer mana
[10:20:16] Fistedqt: to only cast if you're in the shadow crash pool reducing your mana costs by 75%
[10:20:30] EatinHashbrowns: yeah Kappa
[10:20:32] Fistedqt: if they cast with 100% mana cost they go oom in 1-2 minutes
[10:20:39] MysticalOS: DBM should do that bulilt in, i think i set it up for 3 person rotation non stop
[10:20:41] Spreadi: so the pools are the key
[10:20:45] Spreadi: but do they do damage
[10:20:45] mikeham91: yes
[10:20:50] mikeham91: no
[10:20:52] Lohth: I mean it‚Äôs old content you can easily find a guide if you want to know
[10:20:53] djgrott: Shroud says it's break time. it's breaktime :)
[10:20:54] Fistedqt: so strictly casting when in the pool allows them to have enough mana to last the whole fight
[10:20:56] abishh: 2121
[10:21:02] Omni35: the pools don't deal damage
[10:21:15] mikeham91: a shadow bolt will fly towards the ranged and do damage, but leave a pool behind, so you avoid the shadow crash then stand in the pool after
[10:21:17] Spreadi: oh so why not stand in the pool then
[10:21:17] ChubbyMikey: drilling your back door?
[10:21:20] Spreadi: cant be that hard
[10:21:25] Fistedqt: the shadow crash deals damage, the pool it leaves behind doesnt
[10:21:29] MysticalOS: I'm literally updating DBM as I watch this ;) latest release fixes the hard mode timers, latest alpha should improve shadow crash target scan accuracy when it goes out during mark
[10:21:34] StayFrostty: gotta say as a raid leader it makes me happy to see chat not understanding wtf is happening
[10:21:37] Toulouse22: shroudDab
[10:21:42] Lohth: Lol
[10:21:57] Fistedqt: @Spreadi you cant always stand in it because the boss casts more shadow crashes which you have to dodge
[10:22:08] Celana: tigzDance
[10:22:09] Spreadi: alright there we go
[10:22:16] Spreadi: so there was a downside to the pools
[10:22:18] sticksaredrifting: LUL
[10:22:22] Spreadi: so u have to move in and out
[10:22:29] mikeham91: yep
[10:22:30] Lexxen: !subcount
[10:22:30] StreamElements: @Lexxen, his sub count is at least 1 shroudKEK
[10:22:32] Fistedqt: yes, and make sure you dont cast while youre out
[10:22:35] Spreadi: now we are talking
[10:22:43] Spreadi: alright so
[10:22:51] KralovnyKral: dang thats a lot of mechanics
[10:22:52] Spreadi: casters should only cast outside the pool
[10:22:54] mikeham91: and while animus is alive it does aoe damage raid wide and debuffs the raid increasing shadow damage taken, so they have to burn the animus asap
[10:22:56] Spreadi: inside
[10:23:00] Spreadi: inside the pool
[10:23:08] Fistedqt: yes
[10:23:12] Spreadi: alright
[10:23:17] Spreadi: makes sense tome
[10:23:20] Spreadi: to me
[10:23:35] Fistedqt: and its on everyone to avoid damage and not chain mark of the faceless because if they take too much damage then the healers end up going oom before the end of the fight
[10:23:40] DMParnasus: Amen brother
[10:23:44] Lucidaeus: ...reactive mode lol wtf

[10:24:03] Spreadi: sure
[10:24:13] mikeham91: its another benefit of stacking warlocks, they can demonic circle port away for marks
[10:24:16] ChubbyMikey: first thing you do when you wake up should be to drink a full glass of water
[10:24:25] 29draco: holy moly

[10:24:49] ChubbyMikey: insanity Kate, just insanity
[10:24:53] Spreadi: did i miss something
[10:24:55] mikeham91: cast inside pool, dodge shadow crash, move out of raid if you get marked
[10:24:56] youhavebeenmislead: eat pray cheeseburger
[10:25:00] Fistedqt: and avoid damage
[10:25:01] x_GROUCHNA_x: If you guys need the Bible, you need therapy!
[10:25:03] mikeham91: burn animus asap, thats pretty much it
[10:25:09] artttietv: j9 needs therapy for sure
[10:25:14] RockTh3Casbah: bye shroud papi not here
[10:25:17] Spreadi: so how about melee
[10:25:18] Miikaeus: Are they gonna try for yogg 0?
[10:25:26] Spreadi: do they need a crashpool
[10:25:27] Fistedqt: melee just stand there and zug
[10:25:27] Lohth: Don‚Äôt pull threat and die to the animus
[10:25:32] StayFrostty: melee just interupt lol
[10:25:36] youhavebeenmislead: lleeerroy
[10:25:39] Fistedqt: and interrupt :D
[10:25:40] Spreadi: melee just urk
[10:25:48] youhavebeenmislead: mjenkinss
[10:25:48] mikeham91: melee has to do an interrupt rotation, but they also have to watch the green saronites and not cleave them down until animus spawns
[10:25:48] shiyameisameiyuri: WHAT IS GOING ON\
[10:25:56] Spreadi: theyre going to kill this boss now
[10:25:57] RedNuker: ok brb
[10:26:01] mikeham91: if they kill a green saronite cloud you cant do hardmode

[10:26:36] Spreadi: what is the problem
[10:26:45] StayFrostty: they're waiting for an AFK dps
[10:26:46] dahlstroemp: Tems ulduar weakaura pack @shroud
[10:26:48] mikeham91: the fight is easy with practice, but for newer people they have to see the mechanics and get used to it

[10:27:17] Lohth: I found this and council as the hardest prog outside of yog 0 back in the day
[10:27:20] artttietv: the fact they all need therapy but none want to admit it is what they are laughing about
[10:27:24] Omni35: it's going to be so hard to do yogg this late even if they do 1 light

[10:40:53] dahlstroemp: @Spreadi no
[10:40:59] Spreadi: no?
[10:41:03] Spreadi: u just said so
[10:41:07] VinceJustPlays: Hard mode
[10:41:16] LustTheDeadlySin: damn homie talked back to a mod üíÄ
[10:41:23] Spreadi: someone just said u cant break the vapors
[10:41:27] dahlstroemp: and got slapped for it
[10:41:28] jimiwithani: should show enemy healing done
[10:41:28] Doja420: @ChubbyMikey why u ban him? i was entertained. he did nothing wrong lol
[10:41:32] StayFrostty: you cant
[10:41:40] Spreadi: have i been joshed
[10:41:47] ChubbyMikey: no, he didn't talk back to a mod, he talked back to an asshole
[10:41:52] StayFrostty: yep
[10:41:52] iThePros: iThePros subscribed with Prime. 
[10:41:58] ChubbyMikey: picked the wrong fight
[10:41:58] Toosks: is this classic?
[10:41:59] Spreadi: ok.
[10:42:01] mikeham91: @Spreadi the vapors create green pools, the shadow crashes creates black pools. no green pools in hardmode
[10:42:07] Lohth: Just don‚Äôt that dude has to be trolling
[10:42:15] Why_is_Barb_Yelling: yeah, classic wrath of the lich king
[10:42:38] Spreadi: :)
[10:42:45] jimiwithani: also the travel time is shorter
[10:42:50] LustTheDeadlySin: i didnt know this game still had a larfe fanbase
[10:42:57] Spreadi: so only black pools
[10:43:04] Why_is_Barb_Yelling: yeah
[10:43:07] Spreadi: so how do u cast in pools if theyre all black
[10:43:07] HotChocolate_: lul mikey
[10:43:14] delinquentcorp: all the backseat gamers in chat say "wayyy oooo"
[10:43:21] clubfed11: im far from okay lol. you and me both
[10:43:21] Spreadi: do they still regen
[10:43:25] plebinatar: his not asking his telling i think
[10:43:26] ThePlayerCoachStun: lmaoooo
[10:43:31] mikeham91: the black pools dont do damage, they increase magic damage and decrease spell cost
[10:43:43] Spreadi: ah yes so
[10:43:46] mikeham91: the shadow crashes do damage then leave a pool behind
[10:43:46] Spreadi: cast in pools
[10:43:48] ThePlayerCoachStun: imagine people back in the day doing this lol
[10:44:01] Spreadi: so dodge crash get in pool
[10:44:02] rushipop: get rid of team heal numbers
[10:44:03] ZebraBacon: thats what ive been thinking
[10:44:07] mikeham91: yes exactly
[10:44:08] ThePlayerCoachStun: did they even have dbm back in the day?
[10:44:15] Spreadi: doesnt seem so hard
[10:44:20] Lohth: Yes
[10:44:21] ZebraBacon: at this point yeah they did
[10:44:24] Why_is_Barb_Yelling: yeah there was dbm
[10:44:33] Spreadi: maybe its a gear issue at this point
[10:44:37] MysticalOS: it bases crash on who boss is targetting, the problem is the boss is still looking at mark target so it misidentifies crash. I have a potential work around in my alpha if these guys want to try it
[10:44:44] rushipop: get rid of heal numbers
[10:44:51] mikeham91: a random ranged also gets marked that heals boss and damages ranged, so they have to move back asap
[10:44:55] Chingo0z: I just saw a clip of shroud on Bnom and he just randomly turned the faucet on and started drinking water like a cat‚Ä¶. I kind of need an explanation. On what his thought was
[10:45:14] StreamElements: Socials: https://twitter.com/Shroud - https://www.youtube.com/shroud - https://www.reddit.com/r/Shroud/ - http://www.instagram.com/shroud
[10:45:21] clubfed11: @Chingo0z thats a throwback
[10:45:22] ToxicJacques: What happened to the DMCA scare lol. Everyone just stop caring and it went away?
[10:45:27] ZebraBacon: @MysticalOS oh shit is that whats going on we were wondering as well
[10:45:29] Spreadi: so ranged stays sort of spread but in close aproximity
[10:45:32] Lohth: They haven‚Äôt survived long enough to tell if it‚Äôs a gear issue for them
[10:45:45] Spreadi: to use the pools
[10:45:48] Chingo0z: @clubfed11 yeah it‚Äôs his best moments vid
[10:45:52] Lohth: Too many mistakes
[10:45:54] clubfed11: @Chingo0z wait till you watch the pee one
[10:46:06] Omni35: damage doesn't matter on this fight
[10:46:09] Spreadi: no no this is fun
[10:46:14] Spreadi: to work out the problem
[10:46:22] mikeham91: @Spreadi ranged can stack in two groups or one, better to stack in one group
[10:46:22] Chingo0z: @clubfed11 That one came up first lol I cried
[10:46:23] Lohth: It does matter when the animus is up
[10:46:32] Spreadi: mm
[10:46:34] MysticalOS: i revised DBMs mark code to filter mark target on crash scan for up to 1 second to try and find real target if it can, and if it can't, then announce both are on one target. i'm hoping it fixes that issue.
[10:46:35] Omni35: if you can't dodge a wrench you can't dodge a ball
[10:46:43] Omni35: gotta get to the animus
[10:46:49] Spreadi: so does the boss do aoe
[10:46:52] bengalbroys: catJAM
[10:46:54] Spreadi: that u have to avoid
[10:47:11] mikeham91: a random ranged person gets marked, that does aoe around them and heals boss, they have to move out of raid asap
[10:47:23] ZebraBacon: look at his message from before that
[10:47:26] MysticalOS: yes
[10:47:28] ZebraBacon: @shroud
[10:47:28] Spreadi: ok so its wise to keep close
[10:47:32] Spreadi: but not too
[10:47:33] jonzkey: yeah he really is
[10:47:35] MysticalOS: i've been updating DBM live off your stream
[10:47:37] Spreadi: so spread and thight

[10:48:14] H0ll0w1x: omg its actually the DBM guy thats sick
[10:48:28] ChubbyMikey: yeah, that's literally the guy
[10:48:30] jonzkey: i knew the name looked familiar
[10:48:30] MysticalOS: if they're willing to try it, set curse or wago client to alpha, check for updates, and install update with new crash code.
[10:48:36] Spreadi: he's a celebrity
[10:48:39] ThePlayerCoachStun: @mysticalos <- this guy deserves VIP
[10:48:41] Spreadi: love your work btw
[10:48:44] Spreadi: dbm guy
[10:48:45] ThePlayerCoachStun: dbm author = god
[10:49:04] H0ll0w1x: yeah seriously, have to thank you for your addon, its so good @MysticalOS
[10:49:09] AldorGG: Shroud is untiltable
[10:49:11] Spreadi: too close BuddhaBar
[10:49:30] MysticalOS: yeah
[10:49:37] Spreadi: gj
[10:49:44] MysticalOS: i revised shadowcrash code to try and correct the false crash announces during mark
[10:49:44] Spreadi: myst
[10:49:47] Nvar: I am impressed they fuck up the very first one lol
[10:49:49] jonzkey: yeah hes saying all you have to do is set dbm to alpha mode
[10:50:00] Chingo0z: Wow. This is amazing.
[10:50:04] Spreadi: mm
[10:50:08] Why_is_Barb_Yelling: run back sucks
[10:50:19] Spreadi: cigarette brb
[10:50:19] MysticalOS: @jonzkey i wish it was that easy, they'd have to install alpha version of update either manually or through updater
[10:50:20] dragoniitezz: I saw from the logs yall finally got Freya down, gz
[10:50:27] XTDtv: mechanics whos fixing cars on streams
[10:50:56] 2200outrage: Bro
[10:50:59] 2200outrage: youre a bum
[10:51:00] Omni35: dbm isn't going to fix them getting hit by aoe
[10:51:02] H0ll0w1x: H0ll0w1x gifted a Tier 1 sub to MysticalOS! This is their first Gift Sub in the channel! 
[10:51:07] jonzkey: @mysticalos yeah i guess your right i haven't actually played since dragonflight beta when a lot of dbm stuff was alpha
[10:51:15] Omni35: it is cool he made live changes
[10:51:31] 2200outrage: Shroud youre goated
[10:51:34] mikeham91: 4 locks, 2 hunters, 2 mages, would be best to stack in one group. locks can instant port to circle, mages can iceblock, hunters can disengage
[10:51:34] 2200outrage: but youre also a bum
[10:51:39] MysticalOS: what updater you use to updaet addons?
[10:51:42] jonzkey: have to reinstall
[10:51:46] mikeham91: for mark
[10:51:47] MysticalOS: most of them you just right click addon and choose release type alpha
[10:51:48] XTDtv: just go DK and hit ams and death strike you don't have to worry
[10:51:48] sturdy_ladder: sturdy_ladder subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 34 months! what up shroud
[10:51:51] MysticalOS: then check for updates
[10:51:53] Lohth: You can also literally look at who the boss targets during the crash cast
[10:52:16] MysticalOS: oh you looking at it manually
[10:52:18] sandeshrai316: LUL LUL LUL LUL
[10:52:18] 2200outrage: Hey guess what
[10:52:23] sandeshrai316: BibleThump BibleThump BibleThump BibleThump BibleThump BibleThump

[10:53:24] thisura96: ludwig want play valorant 1 v 1
[10:53:25] Omni35: They're blaming dbm for not calling out a specific person for getting targeted in a group of 5 people like they have names memorized
[10:53:29] MysticalOS: don't forget to reload
[10:53:35] jonzkey: yeah type /reload
[10:53:41] Omni35: it's clearly a silly excuse

[10:54:43] Ordos88: yeah there is a consol command to come out more
[10:54:43] jonzkey: you can zoomout further by going to camera distance to max
[10:54:47] XTDtv: the best way to update your addons is to just pull your hardrive out and do it manually
[10:54:54] MrPink604: just do a quick /reload it's all about the casters anyways
[10:54:55] helgi90: with addon (leatrix)

[10:55:42] jimiwithani: it's pretty free once animus is dead
[10:55:49] MysticalOS: 2.6 is max, 3.5 wouldn't work
[10:55:57] MysticalOS: it'd just round down to 2.6
[10:56:31] ShoraNy: @KirbyStomP LOL BatChest
[10:56:31] _Ïã¨Ïà†ÎÇú_Ï§ÄÌëú_: !sens

[10:56:35] ChubbyMikey: @wtfabraz123 he said if he played a game one day, but not the next, it's cause he doesn't care about it
[10:57:07] _Ïã¨Ïà†ÎÇú_Ï§ÄÌëú_: !valorantsens
[10:57:07] StreamElements: Valorant: Sens: 0.8/Scoped 1 | DPI: 400 - Windows: 6/11 - Raw-Input: On - 1000 Hz Polling Rate

[11:01:13] MysticalOS: did i messup? :D

[11:01:16] mikeham91: locks can demonic circle mark, mages can ice block, hunters can disenage, etc. they have 4 locks, 2 mages, 2 hunters, would be good to stack in one group
[11:01:17] wtfabraz123: ok thanks

[11:02:02] wtfabraz123: ok how can i play it does it have a diffrent server
[11:02:16] samxk: chat did shroud say anything about playing lost ark ever?
[11:02:16] Lightofscorpio: just9n4Head
[11:02:21] EatinHashbrowns: Ya ranged should mega pump on this fight esp locks
[11:02:21] MrPink604: DKs just hit diff
[11:02:24] osoi____: shroudRage
[11:02:25] PsyNytes: He quit fully @samxk
[11:02:27] Ordos88: yeah your locks should be too dps on that fight
[11:02:31] jonzkey: this is the dk expansion
[11:02:31] Contrarymoon7: really depends on shadow crash rng
[11:02:31] samxk: @PsyNytes oh Sadge
[11:02:33] jimiwithani: the range were getting rng screwed from no puddles in p2
[11:02:33] Ordos88: top*
[11:02:35] wtfabraz123: is lost ark good

[11:02:40] marp2: what raid is this
[11:02:42] StayFrostty: @shroud they have to move constantly, and don't have the mana to fully pump
[11:02:43] Kerrumz: @wtfabraz123 no one playing new world so there is less servers to pay for. Still over a million concurrent players in wow. Costs way more to keep it going. though blizzard squanders the money...
[11:02:49] wtfabraz123: ok thanks man
[11:02:51] zev319: 2 group p1, and back to 1 group p2

[11:03:17] MysticalOS: i think i'll change mark timer to have audio countdown by default
[11:03:18] Exokay: @shroud u might want to reload again to see if the lua error was caused by Dbm
[11:03:34] haaiikku: @shroud the other DK's if they are frost should be pumping as hard as J9 yall have some dps that are relatively low for this fight
[11:03:37] GSsabino: JonCarnage
[11:03:41] mikeham91: focus macro for interrupt on boss during animus maybe
[11:03:44] Kerrumz: @wtfabraz123 hope microsoft can make them better but i doubt it. went to shit with activision....
[11:03:48] iameric_yu: its been days since you play a FPS game, thats the magic of wow baby
[11:03:51] XTDtv: @shroud have you guys never done this before lol
[11:04:16] mallaraya: NotATK

[11:15:43] PsyNytes: monkaHmm
[11:15:51] ThePeppaJack04: is this just a giant dps check?
[11:15:54] mikeham91: they have 4 locks, its good to hold for 50% so they get a good execute phase
[11:15:54] ibiza1771: your using 2 mins on spawn WITHOUT lust
[11:16:20] triplezro: last night without rdruid then its back to regular scheduled programmin Prayge
[11:16:45] glisteningfrank: howdy GANG GANG GANG
[11:17:08] mikeham91: my guild also had some healers standing in melee range and focus on tank healing, helped with mark damage
[11:17:14] StayFrostty: lust won't make too much difference when people are fucking up mechanics
[11:17:16] XTDtv: guessing only make a asshole out of you and them.
[11:17:20] mikeham91: and it helped spread healer mana out
[11:17:23] Carias0397: fire background music tho
[11:17:37] ibiza1771: lust at the same time with pkt and 2 mins is going to prevent way more damage then holding for 50%

[11:19:02] mikeham91: @shroud have some healers stand in melee range, it will help with mark damage, every little bit helps
[11:19:12] XTDtv: right lust at either the start or at 30%
[11:19:27] Strawhat2788: hardmode?
[11:19:42] EatinHashbrowns: that makes less sense
[11:19:45] CarrotyTucker: 90 for sure

[11:22:33] ibiza1771: why not
[11:22:37] StayFrostty: tell people lust is at 100 and save cds
[11:22:41] zev319: so 2 groups in p1, and 1 group in p2 lol
[11:22:50] ibiza1771: people do it all the time on retail
[11:23:08] ibiza1771: exactly yeah
[11:23:22] XTDtv: lol
[11:23:31] mikeham91: my guild has most of our healers stand in melee range, helps with marks and raid healing the animus a lot since they dont have to move
[11:23:39] SourGummies: ibiza1771 retail doesnt have as many rng proc trinkets and cds are pretty much all 2 or 1.5mins
[11:24:09] ibiza1771: okayyyyyyyy but if it's rng then it doesn't matter when you lust

[11:24:50] WeWereInJamaicaOrNewyork: üòé
[11:24:52] Omni35: @shroud if you want to idiot proof this fight you can have your range stand in an arc and just not attack unless they get a shadow crash
[11:25:28] StayFrostty: that strat is too slow for Hardmode omni
[11:25:30] SourGummies: it does matter cause they're all off icd at the start unless you trinket swap to put them on icd
[11:25:41] osoi____: shroud catKISS
[11:25:48] frusty: stressful boss huh
[11:25:56] SourGummies: they will become desynced unless everyone's trinkets have the same icd and proc at the exact same time

[11:30:16] Omni35: the arc strat Only effects the hard enrage
[11:30:38] StayFrostty: it minimizes how many players get the buff though
[11:30:46] StayFrostty: so it takes longer to kill animus
[11:30:50] ibiza1771: it's not bad, you do more dam at the beginning the less dam you will take, holding lust just makes you take more dam over time
[11:31:15] Omni35: I wouldn't say it minimizes it

[11:32:01] zev319: their best damage was in 2 groups tho, at least so far
[11:32:17] zev319: maybe it was just good crash spread
[11:32:25] Omni35: people have killed this in 2 groups and 1 group it doesn't matter
[11:32:33] nickob14: Is this hard mode
[11:32:37] goodtalk10: 1 groups would be better as long as they are paying more attention to the debug then maxing out dps
[11:32:44] StreamElements: Check out Mike's Instagram account - http://www.instagram.com/shroud :D

[11:46:18] MysticalOS: when i tanked this on warrior in 2008 I'd just charge in and boss wouldn't move, but modern code he inches forward. not the same.
[11:46:18] JeffMich09: then mark of faceless runs straight back and the groups move side to side
[11:46:19] boglehc: this is some brutal progression
[11:46:24] JeffMich09: makes healing the boss minimum
