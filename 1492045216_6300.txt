[2:32:33] Arwenack: Housing where I live went up massively due to people working from home more, so lots are moving from the cities to the countryside
[2:32:39] LegoCoin: interest rates will go back down again since anything much higher on new asset values stagnates sales
[2:32:53] Aidler: if most people can't afford to buy... prices will go down again
[2:33:06] toobaked1987: No. Rates are going higher to help fix inflation
