[0:58:38] ekiprkl: but not worth the other shit they implemented
[0:59:11] MaulerX: I thought the point of hit chance buffs and items was to eliminate or at least mitigate dodge.
[0:59:28] ekiprkl: like if you want that it comes with feral druids being the best dps class because reasons
[0:59:54] Balruk_: i remember when wthe classic  community realized mobs had a 14% parry chance and it was crazy
[1:00:07] Balruk_: still kinda is high
[1:02:01] Balruk_: its only kinda rough when you get the double parry starter for threat lol
[1:03:41] ekiprkl: just be a druid tank and wear leather
[1:04:07] xznips: its about your pulk variance if you crit early you are save
[1:04:21] xznips: for the long explanation i would need ot long :D
[1:04:37] MaulerX: Its because crit does double threat. Higher threat, higher damage your DPS can do.
[1:04:43] Balruk_: i really like getting parry. its like a chance for a WF proc but its not on alot of items
[1:05:01] Balruk_: crit sounds dumb but im not a tnk main
[1:05:18] ferore_lks: it decreases pull variance more than pure AP
[1:05:31] brock_games: a big crit early on is the best feeling as a tank, huge threat allows you to use globals more freely
[1:05:58] xznips: on horde and alliance your opener is 75% of the fight
[1:06:01] Balruk_: SMOrc huh??
[1:06:53] Kewzu: Flurry since you have fast weapons
[1:07:09] Balruk_: str is kinda a bad tank stat i thought, its other affect gives you block chance but you dont wear a shield
[1:07:17] Kewzu: Yea but as a tank vs dps. tanks ru faster weapons on avg
[1:07:22] Balruk_: or higher block
[1:07:34] xznips: i personally shill HARD for agi.. raw crit is kinda meeh
[1:07:36] forashona: block value not block chance
[1:07:50] Balruk_: right mb ^
[1:07:54] Balruk_: mis spoke
[1:08:09] forashona: @xznips agi bis
[1:08:46] forashona: armor, dodge, crit, all very useful
[1:08:59] ekiprkl: so what's the reason that people roll trolls on horde to be tanks? wouldn't tauren with more hp be better?
[1:09:14] xznips: take an example my fav ring in the game is band of reanimation lirly god tier tank ring
[1:09:31] Kewzu: Racial for opening
[1:09:36] Balruk_: Berserker !!!
[1:09:48] pizac7: its base health
[1:09:50] we_are_whomp: bosses don't hit hard enough for hp to be that big of a factor
[1:09:52] Balruk_: its HP %
[1:09:53] we_are_whomp: as much as tps does
[1:09:55] Kewzu: base stamina so kinda useless

The problem comes in when its a chronic issue. Becauase the cops will stop handling it and you will need to get code enforcement involved. And getting them to do anything is like trying to pull teeth from a chicken.
