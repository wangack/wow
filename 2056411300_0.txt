[0:05:51] Renfuryy: yeah it would just be to have something to do and get my last 1k to exalted keking
[0:06:07] trekkin: FOR LOVE SILLY

[0:06:55] Renfuryy: that part wasn’t important, you can never see my tabard anyway since im a dwarf sad
[0:07:16] Renfuryy: I use the item to turn into a ninja
[0:07:31] Renfuryy: because then I’d be ugly

[0:12:13] SHammerdD: exhausted. havent caught up on sleep yet from the trip
[0:12:16] Joewrx: Yea thats what iv been doing for raids
[0:12:19] trekkin: gdkps now = ban LUL
[0:12:20] Fuzzybeard90: hey guys Hugs frenn
[0:12:26] Joewrx: but ill come to guild runs now lol
[0:12:31] paannzz: @trekkin in sod only
[0:12:47] bassey_: gdkp and boosts are now bannable
[0:13:04] Joewrx: @bassey_ when did they boosts? is that real
[0:13:05] trekkin: no in every version of the game it is
[0:13:18] paannzz: @trekkin no its not
[0:13:20] Fuzzybeard90: Ive been sick so its been sucky but im chillin
[0:13:24] Renfuryy: just sod
[0:13:27] SHammerdD: gdkp in sod is banned
[0:13:34] bassey_: yeah some boosters copped a ban since the weekly reset
[0:13:47] Joewrx: WoTLK gdkp is good. SoD they want to preserve the spirit of the game they said
[0:13:50] paannzz: just SOD because they don't want to ruin the spirit of the game in sod
[0:13:53] trekkin: this is a soft run to see if they ban it in all formats
[0:14:02] paannzz: no its not
[0:14:02] calivarr: i have a buddy that got banned for a sod gdkp
[0:14:03] Joewrx: they claimed GDKP ruined guild/social experience
[0:14:04] Renfuryy: they’re experimenting with how it will change things on sod and they believe it’s more against the ideology of sod
[0:14:07] SHammerdD: they need to ban fly hacking.... not gdkp
[0:14:19] canadaspanks: Because it's really hard to make gold back in classic so someone can pay to win buying BIS on ah
[0:14:26] Elijahss: fuegoSpin
[0:14:44] paannzz: the rest of the game versions are already ruined
[0:14:53] calivarr: if they ban gdkp on classic i'm done KEKW
[0:15:14] bassey_: and the gold buying infestation has grown way too big
[0:15:57] TomCat: !ƧYAWYИA YƧIAႧ TЯOԳԳUƧ
[0:15:59] caleb_barcelos: !quack
[0:16:04] caleb_barcelos: Hello
[0:16:05] Joewrx: i just like getting paid at the end of the run. Epic Staff dropped my last run. 70g payout EZ
[0:16:10] paannzz: I dont care either way to be honest. people will find a way around it
[0:16:31] Elijahss: When Classic first hit in 2019 GDKP was not a thing.  I mean maybe some people did it but it was way less of a thing.
[0:16:34] trekkin: bruh gold is easy to make once you hit max lvl each quest is like 1g+
[0:17:09] SHammerdD: they just dont have the personnel to constantly review account reports. ever since activision merge, they only cared about profit, not product
[0:17:18] Joewrx: I was doing GDKP BWL idr if it was a thing in p1 though
[0:17:19] Elijahss: fuegoHi
[0:17:31] Joewrx: was def a thing on my server by P2 though
[0:17:38] trekkin: its for all the lazy deplorable human beings that refuse to actually play the game and would rather buy gold then play the actual game. go find another game to pay to win
[0:17:53] Elijahss: Facts
[0:17:57] paannzz: Ive made all my money in sod fishing
[0:18:07] Renfuryy: except that blizzard sells gold in every other version of the game keking
[0:18:22] paannzz: 600g from selling items from trunks
[0:18:25] Elijahss: Yeah...
[0:18:29] Nezinnx: DESI LETS GOOOOOOOOOO

[0:22:48] TomCat: oh, getting feisty today
[0:23:06] TomCat: you think I don't know that?
[0:23:12] TomCat: lol
[0:23:16] Tenriism: I mean...it's called fuego for a reason.
[0:23:54] TomCat: so what you're trying to say is "shut up boomer, you need new material"
[0:24:26] MrAchse: Hola desi, tengo una consulta, como seria la fase 2 ?
[0:24:45] trekkin: just fyi Weber has a grill seasoning called "Fireball" which is a cinnamon whisky rub for you alcoholics out there
[0:24:46] TomCat: ok fine then. tomcat10Pog tomcat10Hi
[0:25:00] DesiHeat: fuegoHi
[0:25:03] Renfuryy: miyav
[0:25:12] Tenriism: Like he is consulting you on how is P2 going to be.
[0:25:33] Tenriism: I am Colombian/Japanese.
[0:25:55] Tenriism: Pregunta/Consulta.
[0:25:57] Eplios: xddJAM
[0:26:20] trekkin: LIFE HAPPENS
[0:26:22] Renfuryy: Looking
[0:27:21] Renfuryy: yes
[0:27:48] bassey_: have like a cooldown on the song requests
[0:28:30] Renfuryy: can you do that with redeems?
[0:28:32] bassey_: maybe 30min per user
[0:28:36] SHammerdD: 20mins?
[0:28:40] Renfuryy: catDespair
[0:28:46] Renfuryy: fossabot has both
[0:28:56] Renfuryy: twitch docnotL
[0:29:04] MannySJ: Heyge
[0:29:45] Renfuryy: 6 is roughly one song req, one of your songs
[0:29:46] SHammerdD: 3-5 mins
[0:29:53] El_Tygr: i think some songs now days are to long
[0:29:53] bassey_: a song us usually 4-5 minutes
[0:30:00] bassey_: is
[0:30:09] Renfuryy: maybe 8-10m?
[0:30:37] bassey_: just do a 10min global cooldown
[0:30:49] MannySJ: No Heyge back SadgeCry
[0:30:50] Elijahss: way too short
[0:31:00] Renfuryy: that guarantees one song req and then one of your songs
[0:31:02] Elijahss: songs these days^
[0:31:21] Renfuryy: yes
[0:31:30] Renfuryy: maybe make it more expensive too
[0:31:38] Renfuryy: since its going to be less available
[0:31:53] paannzz: definitely felt some music choices were troll
[0:32:02] El_Tygr: hard to balance im sure
[0:32:28] glutenrich69: WHOA
[0:32:50] Renfuryy: people will be less tempted to spam songs if its going to cost more (although some people have tons of points anyway)
[0:33:03] paannzz: points are easy to come by just by tuning in
[0:33:08] Joewrx: gamba is the best
[0:33:43] trekkin: do like grocery stores: 9.99
[0:33:47] paannzz: its fine
[0:33:53] SHammerdD: so no way for individual cooldown? so no person can have back to back to back
[0:33:56] Renfuryy: i think its fine, it wont let people take control of the vibe, but can still request
[0:34:57] Renfuryy: that would be weird, 10 requests would happen within an hour or two and then it would just be out of stock
[0:35:02] glutenrich69: bad taste protection KEKG
[0:35:15] DesiHeat: 5
[0:35:19] Tenriism: People should also stick to the vibe and let it naturally morph gradually instead of go from one extreme to the other in genres.
[0:35:47] Renfuryy: per user would work, but increasing the cooldown is still probably better
[0:36:00] asddyo: hi fuegoHi
[0:36:25] Circler_Alex: fuegoRave fuegoRave  yooooo
[0:37:02] glutenrich69: good, just came home from work YEP hbu donkL
[0:37:34] Renfuryy: people have different tastes in music, whether it agrees with the vibe is kinda subjective, and others just troll
[0:37:40] glutenrich69: SUSSY request
[0:38:07] NurfMe206: hola desi!!
[0:38:18] Tenriism: I see, that's why the 10 min CD is great as you can pick the next song that isn't request to reset the mood.
[0:38:33] Renfuryy: keking
[0:39:58] Fuzzybeard90: Just remove requests and put on fruit salad on repeat EZ Clap
[0:40:23] NurfMe206: im bueno, gracias, y tu
[0:40:34] Fuzzybeard90: if nothing else, you can just always hold skipping power and say fuck em keking
[0:40:47] NurfMe206: im "alright" too, cries on the inside
[0:41:00] Fuzzybeard90: why not keking
[0:41:01] paannzz: hurts the sensitive feelers
[0:41:06] Renfuryy: YEP
[0:41:06] Fossabot: YEP
[0:41:16] Fuzzybeard90: Hmmm I see
[0:41:18] Renfuryy: you should be able to skip, but people do get mad sometimes xff

[2:00:22] MistahClaun: i don't want to create a big phylosophical problem here. but ALSO it is way easier to be a guys and be "real" than when you are a girl, the level of judgement you face is completely different
[2:00:22] Tenriism: Car salesmen are sharks.

[2:06:04] killgore25: its pretty fair to me
[2:06:42] theman10n: gender is a pretty large part of who we are as people
[2:06:52] skrin001: Gender does not matter its how you talk that matters. in my opinion. I do more listening to streams then watching them
[2:06:53] killgore25: the more interesting contrast is between authenticity and selling yourself.
[2:07:11] MistahClaun: oh no, again, i'm not talking about it is if it should efine if people are authentic or not
[2:07:32] BarefacedYeti: Cheer

[2:09:19] theman10n: yeah desi just do you, and you’ll find the right people that way
[2:09:43] theman10n: getting worried about superficial stuff like gender and meta ideas will only lead you down a fake path and to fake people
[2:09:44] xZakova: Fuckin A right
[2:09:55] Spear0vv: modCheck good people
[2:09:59] theman10n: so all you can really do is be yourself and and try to stick with the real people
[2:10:18] MistahClaun: i'm going to showcase in a very simple example. do you think asmongold has to have this kind of conversation with his viewers? his authenticity is implied.

[2:27:39] trekkin: the human condition is to try and control everything. once you accept that you can't control everything and just let life play out you'll find that the big things you worry about arent even worth worrying over
[2:28:03] MistahClaun: @trekkin the basis of stoicism

[2:31:28] killgore25: Yesss hes great

[2:32:51] MistahClaun: the issue about this idea "people have less so i should be happy" is that you invalidate your own suffering
[2:32:52] treviheat: fuegoYay
[2:32:59] BarefacedYeti: peepoCheer
[2:33:02] a_versi: wow!
[2:33:02] MistahClaun: exactly

[2:34:21] killgore25: our best comparison is our past selves. its the only fair comparison and only one that matters
[2:34:25] trekkin: your feelings are still valid. The MAIN problem now is everyone is always looking at their neighbors lawn and thinking the grass is greener when they have a perfectly healthy lawn. the problem is people try and get a new lawn vs cultivating and watering your own
[2:34:37] o_squared: Two things can exist at once, your emotions are valid and we can acknowledge all the other struggles in the world people go through.
[2:34:46] MistahClaun: yeah, your pain is your own, of course taking it in perspective and looking at the bigger frame it can help you to create better tools to deal with your own struggles
[2:35:20] cosmin284: fuego keep focus on what is fuego best for you Daisy fuegoFeller fuegoL fuegoH fuegoQueen <3  to fuego take care of your self is fuego  priority and you fuego have the fuego best amazing fellers fuego supportive fuego  community that fuego care about you a lot Heartgers

[2:38:05] Deisolx: I had to Google where Buffalo is
[2:38:20] xZakova: It's huge. Former Industrial age if you will, basically, the iron industry brought population to buffalo.
[2:38:25] o_squared: Whats bigger sacremento or buffalo?
[2:38:26] TomCat: there are at least 13 states with a city named Buffalo

[2:41:03] Tenriism: 1st one seemed like a premade. But Alliance is :( right now.
[2:41:13] TomCat: Glitter gets everywhere and you can never get rid of all of it
[2:41:17] xZakova: If you let someone fuel your emotions - lose them :)
[2:41:24] MistahClaun: it is important to remember we are contextual beings. so our sadness and happiness will come and go. and at the saddest it is important to keep in mind it will pass.
[2:41:59] xZakova: The bomb cyclone was buffalo on christmas day lol
[2:42:03] MistahClaun: maybe they didnt change the bg queue yet, maybe it will be only tomorrow
[2:42:17] o_squared: Dang Sac is huge
[2:43:12] trekkin: @killgore25 you have to be careful though, because while one may think and be 'deep' you can lose yourself in theorisms and lose touch with reality. its whats happening now in schools
[2:43:13] Fuzzybeard90: Yeah im struggling to move on from things but i just gotta get better NODDERS
[2:43:37] xZakova: Life is an elevator - as you progress upwards, people (friends) will get on, and off accordingly. You need to take a step back and see who will be there on floor 100.
[2:43:38] TomCat: what is your biggest challenge that you can share with us?

[2:44:12] kissg00dbye: its hope
[2:44:15] Tenriism: Life is finite. I think having something to look forward to while we live is what keeps us going on.
[2:44:25] cosmin284: kermitNODDERS
[2:44:46] trekkin: BE LIKE IRON. SMOOTH OUT THE WRINKLES IN LIFE. LOOK GREAT TOO
[2:44:51] MistahClaun: the issue lies exactly in the fact we are taught we have to search for happiness and it is not true, we have to work towards being "at peace" with ourselves. then we can enjoy happniness when it comes and deal better with sadness when it happens too
[2:45:00] killgore25: the healthygamer sessions sound really informative
[2:45:27] Renfuryy: Aloo

[4:42:49] mrhood71: can get a waterlogged envelope if u dont have it while in wetlands
[4:43:03] OloCdn: why would "quest" stacking be not allowed? its literally part of the game to do quests and turn em in.
[4:43:04] Footylol: Do items of consequence chain until you have, audience with the king
[4:43:32] Renfuryy: hes an actual dev but he didnt post that

[4:43:41] Fuzzybeard90: i mean i would get not wanting to have people stack quests and just shoot through content. But I dont see how they could stop it from happening
[4:43:57] Zefior: i double checked its fake
[4:44:06] OloCdn: there is no puns or jokes in it, which is something Josh Greenfield does a lot
[4:44:06] Zefior: but people believe anything
[4:44:21] DakuiOG: just some loser that is trying to bait ppl to turn all the quests in, so he has an advantage
[4:44:34] trekkin: at MAX its 20 quests which is like a level at most

[5:49:10] bassey_: that is alot of alliance
[5:49:12] trekkin: thats not a script LUL silly console commands
[5:49:19] Mainja: hackerman
[5:50:03] BrennisteinnTTV: a console command is a one-line script tho
[5:50:08] Elijahss: I think it would be multiple commands
[5:50:15] trekkin: a script is a sequence of instructions or commands
[5:51:39] bassey_: go along the river further east
[5:52:00] trekkin: macros are basically a set of commands instructed within the game vs a script which generally runs on the actual scripting language

[7:16:20] OloCdn: max sized group is like 5 or something now
[7:16:43] alphasqyd: @OloCdn nah u can still queue 10
[7:16:59] Renfuryy: if the system doesn't care then youll still queue into premades
[7:17:04] Renfuryy: sometimes
[7:17:11] alphasqyd: yeh so if queue time is too long
[7:17:13] OloCdn: @alphasqyd guess I was lucky, i've done 25 bg's without a premade so far.
[7:17:28] LeeshDK: if the wait is too long they'll match you with premades just to keep it moving
[7:17:31] alphasqyd: and its not really about ur queue time... if a premade is sitting in queue for long enuf theyll get a non premade
