[0:44:38] NinjaFleas: yeah whats the deal with the trinket?
[0:44:58] Otton_03: They used the cheat death trinket to despawn some adds
[0:44:58] Moobot: Check out Towelliee's latest Youtube video! https://youtu.be/U8-64zqVa8k Shadowlands needs some help
[0:45:08] Glisur85: I doubt it was an exploit, I think limit is doing the same now
[0:45:30] Glisur85: that sounds sus
[0:45:31] konmenos: people are gonna be mad cause they used it on non tanks
[0:45:41] DrakhanGaming: Are there only 2 boes per armor type from raid
[0:46:17] DeeKeeezy: How much gold do you have?
[0:46:22] xhaven: doesn't matter if it was on non tanks imo
[0:47:10] maccaruso: If a trinket is being used to "despawn" mobs I'm fairly confident in calling it unintended or an exploit.
[0:47:22] usse00: How long is usually a world first race? I feel like this tier is going so fast or is it actually not taking that long? ^^ Thought it would last for some weeks, but they may be stuck on Sylvanas for a while ^^
[0:48:08] buodild: just them playing the game and blizzard games being blizzard games lol
[0:49:23] xhaven: on blizzard end
[0:49:26] kashmara: limit ran normal mode last night to get the trinket, I guess.
[0:50:06] maccaruso: Correct, unintended

[1:32:44] ninedraft317: i think they get reborn
[1:32:44] akia03: hes dead dead
[1:32:48] Kisswani: the soul gets destroyed , I think there's some lore to explain in game
[1:32:54] jkitchin75: @rosashy we are not done with her
[1:32:55] JubJubWantRubRubs: maybe he died and came to OUR world monkaS
[1:33:07] kashmara: a warchief has made it to the water
[1:33:08] FistoTheFistybot: Ursoc is dead cause they used his anima & Garrosh's anima got vaporized LUL
[1:33:11] DragonofWolves: Garrosh as a turtle... so hes part of the Tortollian race now?
[1:33:19] SavageCheez: maybe he's anima now
[1:33:24] DrakhanGaming: Would he be a brown or green turtle
[1:33:24] Lulaboo: @FistoTheFistybot The counter arguments come down to DENIAL. Because she had been lied to and just kept going because she didnt wanna believe she was played. AGAIN
[1:33:34] Molvonos: @Towelliee Some broker's gonna gather up Garrosh's ashes and Varian's ashes and set up a coke party.,
[1:33:36] Bayne77: Garrosh reincarnated as Thralls loincloth.
[1:33:46] Colt_Engineer: but hey at least his shoulder transmogs are now on the black market auction house
[1:33:51] Goosemantm: he turned into soul ash, he's part of my legendary ring now
[1:34:05] FistoTheFistybot: Lulaboo I know, but I saw people argue that Sylvanas was the one using the Jailer LUL cause she wanted her soul back and she "won"
[1:34:06] Gappopo: They better kill her still. anniesREE
[1:34:14] Kisswani: the weekly campaign quests has been so good , loved the one with Draka and Thrall this week danLove

[1:34:50] Molvonos: @FistoTheFistybot Aint no one legit believe that unless they're Sylv-simps who can't believe she's a badly written character.
[1:34:51] daemonchilde92: Maybe she's like Menethil
[1:34:59] JubJubWantRubRubs: i imagine shes the same, but shes now capable of feeling guilt etc over what she did
[1:35:01] Colt_Engineer: @Towelliee now she's going to get visions of some planets and how we have to heal some woons!
[1:35:04] Rottencoarse: @Towelliee i do not think lothremar will accept her tbh after what happened
[1:35:15] Kisswani: I read on WoWhead like a speculation when she says " stop him before ... " she may have been talking about Arthas and the sunwell
[1:35:21] Lulaboo: I hope Sylvanas has the most guilt in the world forever
[1:35:26] kashmara: yes
[1:35:27] DragonofWolves: No actually Sylvanas character is written well. Just BfA/SL messed it up a little
[1:35:28] daemonchilde92: Could she be like Arthas's Sister

[1:36:08] akia03: @Lulaboo she wont remember anything so no guilt
[1:36:11] DragonofWolves: Well technically shes still undead...
[1:36:12] Molvonos: Aint no one gonna invite her anywhere.

[2:06:24] catlover1100: it already started a riot on annies channel
[2:06:34] pereadin: tell my wife this Towel! shes always telling me what opinions i should have xD
[2:06:35] catlover1100: lol
[2:06:37] SavageCheez: Looked like Cohh was trying to help Quin save face
[2:06:57] Rottencoarse: @Towelliee people needs to play a game how they want to play a game. Shut off those nerds
[2:07:03] Arawn67: Quin went about it all wrong. He was being toxic about it and so he got a toxic response.
[2:07:09] SavageCheez: I'm of the same mind T
[2:07:11] jdickson93: i think the anti streamer thing is popular for a lot of game communities though, probably because they are jealous of streamers LUL
[2:07:14] Aidler: True but also true that Quin was only out to troll FF14 from the start
[2:07:17] Gappopo: FFXIV is a great game. But they have their hardcore zealots for sure lol
[2:07:18] CrunkyBrewster: truth
[2:07:22] ThaOriginalGamester: he's from that hemisphere that don't GAF lol
[2:07:29] Tyrammus84: Quins a dumbass he wants this attention
[2:07:29] SavageCheez: Everyone is entitled to their own opinion
[2:07:37] catlover1100: yep so true
[2:07:39] KragnosWoW: tusks of mannoroth are in black market AH POGGERS
[2:07:45] chickdrummer88: if you aren't a jrpg fan, you won't like ff14
[2:07:59] catlover1100: 750k bid to 1m
[2:08:05] Eviltuna13: must of been a slow drama week. people making shit up to start trouble rooC
[2:08:11] Molvonos: Gatekeeping FF14
[2:08:16] Oneeye2cu: Oneeye2cu subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 48 months! 
[2:08:17] CrunkyBrewster: I see the sppeal of ff14. But i am like Quinn.
[2:08:19] KragnosWoW: 1.2 Mill atm
[2:08:22] catlover1100: they already did on annie fuchsia channel
[2:08:23] CrunkyBrewster: appeal*
[2:08:23] Sollice: I think the problem is the term weeb. I think at this point it gets overused.
[2:08:26] DragonofWolves: I love both games, but Quins response was the wrong response imo.
[2:08:38] Catspaw66: Catspaw66 subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 30 months!

[2:08:52] fabibi_10: you're crazy
[2:08:52] Oneeye2cu: Morning Towelliee Morning stream
[2:08:53] Arawn67: I see what you are saying, but at the same time you can say you don't like a game without purposely triggering those fans then call victim when they bite back.
[2:08:56] Sollice: weeb I think at this point may be a derogatory thing
[2:08:58] Catspaw66: np -)
[2:09:03] Recaud: SMOrc you no true orc
[2:09:05] 91Niki: I think it was more the fact that Quin went like a toxic route on how he hated the game, instead of "i don't like this game" and move on. That's what got them triggered
[2:09:09] CritcobainTV: i wouldn't spend 50k on them KEKW
[2:09:19] Aidler: @dragonofwolves Quins responses are mostly toxic and wrong. Great entertainment though
[2:09:27] CrunkyBrewster: hahah
[2:09:40] Arawn67: You should have seen his stream it was not as mellow as you think lol

[2:09:47] belfastcl: @Aidler isn't he known precisely for being toxic in general
[2:09:51] KragnosWoW: the seller is "sha of pride" what lmao??
[2:09:53] catlover1100: yes very true
[2:09:59] CrunkyBrewster: there's some bits of ff14 i liked. i dont like that the main story is something I have to do to progress
[2:10:01] KragnosWoW: sha of pride sell stuff to black market KEKW
[2:10:08] valth: valth subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 45 months! 
[2:10:22] Recaud: were the criticisms constructive at the very least?
[2:10:23] Horseweave: Oh man
[2:10:27] soooonerdy: eh every game community is like that , there isn't a game where everyone is so nice and accepting lol
[2:10:28] 91Niki: Quins tweet was fine. The clips i've seen of him talking about the game, that's a WHOLE other boat of toxic LUL
[2:10:30] Glisur85: Method killed Fatescribe
[2:10:30] Sollice: Thats because FF is "their game".
[2:10:30] Aidler: @belfastcl he is swiftYep
[2:10:52] Arawn67: Yeah the stream is what i think triggered the twitter spat
[2:11:02] Horseweave: The *Outsider* mindset of FF is real
[2:11:03] belfastcl: @Aidler I only knew him because he was toxic to payo, calling him a R on classic beta
[2:11:04] Norcore: @Sollice and that's exactly why I don't like weebs, it's tribalism
[2:11:14] duhworks: someone made a youtube video about it
[2:11:20] valth: i play both ff and wow.. switching between them when i feel like it
[2:11:22] Sollice: @Norkore Why are they weebs because they like a FF14?
[2:11:22] Moobot: Check out Towelliee's latest Youtube video! https://youtu.be/U8-64zqVa8k Shadowlands needs some help
[2:11:23] catlover1100: so why did he even bother doing that\
[2:11:32] Horseweave: @norkore That's not Tribalism though
[2:11:34] CrunkyBrewster: Damn spot on with me too
[2:11:42] CritcobainTV: People are big mad KEKW
[2:11:45] SavageCheez: then everyone shit on him
[2:11:45] KragnosWoW: Thats a fair opinion
[2:11:48] 91Niki: @Towelliee The FF people got upset about the way he was trashing and being toxic about it on the stream. Not his tweet
[2:11:48] dinomiyte: who are we talking about?
[2:11:51] CrunkyBrewster: I love that it has this massive community behind it. it feels live
[2:12:03] CrunkyBrewster: nah i wont
[2:12:04] Norcore: @Sollice no, it's not about liking the game. there are many people who like the game and they are not weebs. I specifically talk about the toxic people who pretend to be "cute" but if you dare to criticize anything they like they doxx you to hell and stuff.
[2:12:09] Sollice: @droopydorf AoC isnt out for 2 years? not soon
[2:12:11] Horseweave: Who are we talking about again?
[2:12:13] CrunkyBrewster: i have no interests in plaything those games really
[2:12:23] Qoax: Happy was right, you should know tho. Any form of internet activity were you can hide behind a screen you will always find c**ts and lots of them
[2:12:26] KragnosWoW: 2 years is considered soon to blizzard LULW
[2:12:28] Aidler: You need to know what he did and said in the game
[2:12:31] Sollice: @Norkore I get what you are saying. Was reading your comment wrong
[2:12:40] maccaruso: You will like FF XIV NOW!!!!!
[2:12:47] timmythegamertv: The whole "x story is better the y story" always loses me! like wtf..
[2:12:47] Mecabeast: feels like the ff community is hotel california
[2:12:56] zSKIz1: People are upset because it’s like watching the end of endgame and saying the movie sucked
[2:12:57] CritcobainTV: you're so close! POGGERS
[2:12:58] CritcobainTV: Kappa
[2:13:04] DiranJei: yikes forever
[2:13:09] Norcore: @Sollice Lirik said it really well, he watches anime, but he does not consider himself a weeb because he is not obsessed with the culture.
[2:13:11] CrunkyBrewster: I would like something like FF 15 more if it was an MMO I think
[2:13:16] Kisswani: ANd it seems that the biggest offenders are ppl who are like level 30 and been playing FF for like 2 weeks and suddenly it's the best game exer LUL like let the streamers reach end game then talk
[2:13:17] DragonofWolves: Well i didnt see that tweet, i saw his quote tweet about some other person calling the FF14 community retarded and stupid. I think thats what set people off tbh
[2:13:36] CrunkyBrewster: New GF basically
[2:13:36] Gappopo: Meanwhile you can trash on WoW all day and its fans will join with you! LUL
[2:13:38] zSKIz1: He didn’t remotely give it his best shot. He played for like 3 hours then boosted past. Just like watching the last 20 minutes of a long tv series
[2:13:44] catlover1100: well asmon and annie are already doing coils?
[2:13:50] CrunkyBrewster: FF14 is the new hot gf right now LUL
[2:14:07] Glisur85: yeah but if I am not interested in a game after 3 hours I am done with it too
[2:14:13] CrunkyBrewster: fair enough too I agree
[2:14:15] catlover1100: agree
[2:14:18] Sollice: cought OUTRIDERS cough ANTHEM
[2:14:30] Kisswani: exactly . it " HIS " best shot
[2:14:32] Broomba: doing Extreme raids at max content
[2:14:36] CrunkyBrewster: exactly
[2:14:37] Molvonos: @Sollice Dude. Still bitter about that shit
[2:14:40] CritcobainTV: I can't understand how people are like "oh, he didn't even try" like, if you can't find anything interesting early on, who the hell can say "you didn't play for more than 3 hours" like. wut
[2:14:43] gidgeet: that was me with it, I tried it played it for a couple of days, was bored with it.
[2:14:43] Moobot: TBC has officially launched! || If you would like to join our community guild in classic while we prepare, we are on Azuresong Horde! Send a request message in the #WoW-TBC channel in Towelliee's discord and a recruiter will be in touch!

[2:14:48] 91Niki: Yeah, we all have different opinions. Gotta accept if people have a different opinion.
[2:14:56] Kisswani: @dinomiyte Quin
[2:15:04] Horseweave: Oh Quin
[2:15:06] CritcobainTV: It's super WeirdChamp
[2:15:14] catlover1100: ahh azuresong id love to help towe but both mains on bc are on stonespine eu x
[2:15:15] Arawn67: If he reacted like you @Towelliee there probably wouldn't be a problem lol
[2:15:21] Horseweave: Yeah, I take whatever he says with a grain of salt.
[2:15:26] bawheid: quinn boosted, went raiding, played shit, died and blamed the healer.
[2:15:31] timmythegamertv: Guess what he's one person, FUCK you know what god forbig this inidividual does not have the same likes and dislikes as you.. YIKES! People want to be individuals, but immediately want everyone to align with their thoughts..
[2:15:31] 91Niki: But yeah, Quin is a drama queen and he talks shit. That's what got the FF community upset 🤷
[2:15:37] catlover1100: ive seen THIS in wow too
[2:15:43] CrunkyBrewster: mmhmm
[2:15:43] Sollice: @Sollice Outriders is still putting out patches to fix the game, but at this point who cares
[2:15:47] CritcobainTV: @Arawn67 he didn't react badly. what he said was his opinion. not really sure how he talked shit about the game
[2:15:48] CrunkyBrewster: very calculated
[2:15:50] zSKIz1: Ya. Saying that makes way more sense. I think if he worded it like you did instead of best shot it might have gone over better
[2:15:50] fewyn: not super surprised
[2:15:52] CritcobainTV: People are weird
[2:16:05] fewyn: didn't blizzard release something for the SWTOR launch?
[2:16:05] Broomba: Watched SummitG play ff14 last night and it looked like he getting into more and more he leveled
[2:16:11] Kisswani: The game is great . definitely worth playing . I'm more shocked that the issues some streamers have in WoW , which is amplified in FF < they suddenly have no problem with
[2:16:14] CrunkyBrewster: hey go for it bro
[2:16:31] DragonofWolves: I finished Outriders and i personally enjoyed the story. Haven't played since though
[2:16:31] Horseweave: People need to realize that some people shouldn't take others seriously
[2:16:35] Sollice: Blizzard always tries to cockblock MMO releases
[2:16:36] CrunkyBrewster: hell i've been playing ESO a lot. that's been my alternative to wow
[2:16:42] Sollice: or expansions or patches
[2:16:44] CritcobainTV: Sometimes u gotta detox from wow, I feel it
[2:16:50] catlover1100: yeah ww monk in my arena team had to be toxic and call me out on pressing bubble too early
[2:16:50] theDirtyon3: ^
[2:17:02] theDirtyon3: I play MLB to break up the monotony of WoW
[2:17:06] Kisswani: Kappa
[2:17:08] CrunkyBrewster: you do do that sir
[2:17:26] CrunkyBrewster: hey i like to see the competitiion
[2:17:35] Sollice: I think at this point if they release 9.2 to coincide with End Walkers it really going to drive home that point and it's really going to back fire.
[2:17:36] KragnosWoW: I just play league of legends and valorant when im not in the wow mood
[2:17:39] catlover1100: know what i did ignored him and reported for language who uses cuss words against me eats a report for ban sorry but i dislike selfish jerks who have big mouth because their class is op
[2:17:40] Molvonos: Rank 5 aint any better @Towelliee
[2:17:49] CrunkyBrewster: the one thing i will admit, it's nice to see another mmo company out there on par with WoW
[2:17:56] Gappopo: Even if they release 9.2 when Endwalker comes out.....i'll be playing Endwalker first this time around.
[2:18:10] Broomba: it might be the first time since playing wow i might skip the last bit of SL of wow to play FF14 when Endwalkers comes out in Nov even if 9.2 drops then @towelliee
[2:18:12] catlover1100: yknow what play whatever you like or enjoy best

[2:23:40] JeffsStolenBike: Just started playing ESO again and it's pretty amazing. I can't believe its not the top talk, instead of FF.
[2:23:44] Kisswani: Baj is setting up a raid I think
[2:24:02] belfastcl: @JeffsStolenBike a lot of people think of 2015's ESO, it has changed a lot
[2:24:10] catlover1100: i believe scripe gingi and roger brown are streaming too
[2:24:17] NinjaFleas: @JeffsStolenBike The only thing that caught my attention in ESO was the PVP, was pretty interesting
[2:24:31] nesretto: i havent played current since early BFA. is it any better after the patch? currently getting abit tired of TBC.
[2:24:43] SilkeySmooth: no eso is the most unbalanced mmo

[2:25:09] CrunkyBrewster: I'm playign through the Blackwood content right now. it's kind of meh. not as good as Morrowind imo
[2:25:19] NinjaFleas: @JeffsStolenBike but, to be fair, my friends were always no lifed and one of the four fo them nearly always had emperor for whatever server or whatever it was. So we would run around and just stomp
[2:25:31] JeffsStolenBike: Thats why I'm saying I 'm blown away it's not being talked about. The PVE content has been incredible.

[2:25:32] DragonofWolves: Yeah ESO to me is what people said it was from the beginning, a Skyrim MMO.
[2:25:38] YellowKiwi: If I want a relaxing night while gathering I should be able
[2:25:40] catlover1100: was emperor a title in that game?
[2:25:43] CrunkyBrewster: ]but what i do enjoy about ESO is that you could literally level in the game and not touch one quest
[2:25:48] belfastcl: @JeffsStolenBike they have been hiring encounter designers from blizz, for the past two expansions I think
[2:26:20] CrunkyBrewster: MMhmm
[2:26:21] Gappopo: Towelliee has forsaken the Alliance towUnforch
[2:26:23] CrunkyBrewster: agreed tow
[2:26:44] Molvonos: @Gappopo Cant' forsake something that's bad by default. towDrunk
[2:26:54] 3dRes: ESO has the Skyrim bug, after all
[2:27:11] CrunkyBrewster: very action based
[2:27:31] belfastcl: the fact that it's an elder scrolls franchise game helps it a lot too
[2:28:04] NinjaFleas: As someone that has played WoW on-and-off since 2005 I just couldn't get too in to ESO with the low amount of abilities
[2:28:12] NinjaFleas: Agreed
[2:28:13] Lulaboo: @Gappopo lol
[2:28:15] CrunkyBrewster: true
[2:28:33] Alt_slash: true
[2:28:37] KragnosWoW: and real
[2:28:38] Neviriah: yeah true
[2:28:44] Hathyn: like Lord of the Rings online, that hot garbage should never of even been released, but its LOTR
[2:28:45] YellowKiwi: The ESO plus for storage space is kindy of meh
[2:28:48] Neviriah: wait, diablo music?
[2:28:50] Neviriah: neviri1BLUSH
[2:28:59] catlover1100: got only to lvl 7 in that one
[2:29:03] SSD511_: @neviriah :)
[2:29:12] Neviriah: @doom_82 I love this!
[2:29:14] catlover1100: lets say female elves there cant compare to wow ones xd
[2:29:17] KragnosWoW: Isnt chinas most popular mobile game literally call of duty but not actually cod?
[2:29:25] NinjaFleas: The biggest turn off to me in ESO was how the auction house worked with guilds having to bid for it or something if I remember correctly
[2:29:31] Gappopo: I have 115 hours in ESO according to Steam. I couldn't tell you anything about that game lol
[2:29:32] CrunkyBrewster: yeah thats the parts of ESO i dont like @YellowKiwi . that you have to pay a sub to have this one thing and without you have to dealw tih annoying inventory management
[2:30:13] CrunkyBrewster: oh god yeah their AH is also kind of garbage. im not a fan of the Guilds thing
[2:30:21] KragnosWoW: catJam
[2:30:24] NinjaFleas: @Gappopo I feel that, I probably have 100-200ish hours in the game, mostly felt like I was just being dragged along by my friends that were in to it when I was not
[2:30:26] YellowKiwi: @crunku_ I cannot play without this feature the storage is just really bad
[2:30:40] NinjaFleas: ESO is sub for extras I believe
[2:30:42] belfastcl: ESO base game is pretty cheap
[2:30:47] Poriand: eso pvp is decent. but eso has a terrible AH system and you need alot of addons
[2:30:50] CrunkyBrewster: @YellowKiwi yup same issue with me too. Oh you wanna Craft?? Pay us money Bitch
[2:30:52] YellowKiwi: Extra like a bank ;)
[2:31:09] NinjaFleas: I just hated how the auction house crap worked in ESO
[2:31:30] JunkiePixells: Hey T, what about pvp mmo’s? In my opinion Lineage 2 is still the top pvp mmo game evermade, damn :)
[2:31:32] pereadin: it'd be interesting to see a game developed off of purely community contribution

[2:33:58] Poriand: diablo immortal will be insane
