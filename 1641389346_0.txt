[7:48:03] Ahira_frostfang: warrior dont have mace stun now or ?
[7:48:38] Deadlyburstx: all in all wrath is an upgrade less resists, more spells to play your char, locks arent afk dotting and spamming curse of tongues, rogs arent tunneling u with 5 wounds
[7:48:49] AlphaRavenQT: !s5bis
[7:48:49] StreamElements: It's in my discord.
[7:50:47] Deadlyburstx: but for pojke is probably more boring since now druid is afk heal bot, no bear charge to play more aggresive
