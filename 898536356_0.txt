[1:41:52] Shailax: no r1 cares about cr its just boring for them boosting friends
[1:42:04] Jaydeelol: the problem i always have is finding a healer :)
[1:42:22] noships: when I came back last season I just played with randos and carried them until I felt good enough to play with actually good players
[1:42:29] noships: *last expansion
[1:42:33] dankNstein_: itll respawn
[1:42:37] Dnulgreb: they just have a fast respawn
[1:42:38] dankNstein_: it depends how many ppl are in the maw
[1:42:43] noships: mage

[1:43:54] dankNstein_: like many xpacs
[1:44:07] FCLiver: DANKIES
[1:44:21] dankNstein_: na the shield is ridiculous and the nerf did like nothing
[1:45:10] noships: I mean from what I can tell the biggest thing about the shield is that it gives them both physical and magic damage reduction and cc reduction on top
[1:45:28] Adeckh55: Hello!
[1:45:31] dankNstein_: yeah and it absorbs a shit ton of damage ontop of all that
[1:45:47] dankNstein_: thats why i said the nerf did like nothing
[1:46:08] Vagorge: valorant?
[1:46:55] pewtanblot: Workout tyongeGachi
[1:46:55] avocadoandpineapplephobia: jnbSubs

[1:53:27] Tactics_lol: nice nice :D
[1:53:32] noships: same
[1:53:41] InsulinDependent: rogue in tbc monkaW
[1:53:45] InsulinDependent: does he not know chat?
[1:53:46] Tactics_lol: Rogue is super hard in PVP in tbc
[1:53:48] Tactics_lol: but so much fun
[1:54:07] noships: no way, rogues were gods in tbc
[1:54:18] Tactics_lol: @noships Best class, but hardest class too yeye
[1:54:35] pewtanblot: @Tactics_lol jnbHey
[1:54:47] Pen_OW: Rogues in TBC got Shadowstep for the first time.
[1:55:01] InsulinDependent: often time no raid slots is the only issue for rogues since they got screwed hardcore in raid dmg, but if youre gonna be an arena king wont matter
[1:55:05] noships: I played warlock & rogue in TBC, I had it good :)
[1:55:27] InsulinDependent: its only the final phase
[1:55:34] InsulinDependent: that rogue would be competitive in tbc
[1:55:35] pewtanblot: @Pen_OW jnbHey
[1:55:36] InsulinDependent: yaya
[1:55:57] noships: as soon as you get blades tho in TBC Kreygasm
[1:56:10] Pen_OW: @pewtanblot jnbHey
[1:56:11] InsulinDependent: the legendaries
[1:56:13] noships: half of TBC is demons
[1:56:15] Tactics_lol: @noships Glaives?
[1:56:22] Tactics_lol: Glaives in arena would be awesome LUL
[1:56:23] noships: yea warglaives
[1:56:24] Tactics_lol: but unlikely
[1:57:01] noships: glaives are 3rd tier right?
[1:57:02] Pen_OW: Wonder if they will keep the 5v5 Arena in TBC
[1:57:47] noships: you get 2 seasons with rogue legendary afaik
[1:58:52] InsulinDependent: my raid spot becomes safe since im able to atiesh boost the locks luckily
[1:59:07] noships: do we know if it will be a wipe or if you keep your vanilla character?
[1:59:19] InsulinDependent: i think it's a safe assumption tbh
[1:59:31] InsulinDependent: id maybe try a fresh
[1:59:37] Tactics_lol: They will keep old ones into TBC for sure. But i hope they make a few fresh TBC tbh
[1:59:38] InsulinDependent: but i dont think enough people would be interested
[1:59:40] dium: use the cloak again
[1:59:46] InsulinDependent: in giving up their investment from classic
[2:00:01] dium: the cloak will get you out
[2:00:03] dium: even in combat
[2:00:22] noships: isn't there people with stupid amounts of gold now @InsulinDependent
[2:00:28] InsulinDependent: ya
[2:00:37] noships: wouldn't that wreck tbc economy
[2:00:45] InsulinDependent: the thing about tbc economy is
[2:00:47] dium: Assassination [With regional restarts] All damage abilities increased by 5%.
[2:00:48] dium: :)
[2:00:56] InsulinDependent: it was always way easier
[2:01:04] InsulinDependent: to farm gold relative to raid expenses in tbc
[2:01:19] InsulinDependent: theres just a lot more gold in TBC relative to classic unless they make some changes
[2:01:37] noships: I think it should be fresh
[2:02:01] InsulinDependent: i think theres no chance of only fresh
[2:02:07] noships: maybe yea
[2:02:09] InsulinDependent: be nice if some new servers were fresh created though
[2:02:17] with_us_funny_clouds: would be absolutely terrible if they only do fresh servers
[2:02:26] noships: man I remember staying up for that FeelsStrongMan
[2:02:38] noships: yung ships
[2:03:09] noships: did your server crash a bunch too?

[8:53:31] KonkyDawng: @DreadF0und yeah felonys are serious im not quite sure but it might be if you have a certain number of misdemeanors they can count towards the 3 strikes but 3 felonies is def 3 strikes, and posessing a gun when you were already convicted is def a felony on itself
