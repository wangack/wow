[0:50:27] haldaz: Is it at all common for era guilds to recruit people and feed them gear (i'd guess due to fighting the roster boss) or was this a thing that fell on your lap?
[0:50:35] angrychimpo_: I stopped at the start of TBC and as much as I wish I copied, I never have the time for WoW
[0:50:44] loot_ninja_: from my pov it seemed like $15 was a really small price to pay to preserve a toon I worked 2+ years on. It's really not that much money
[0:50:45] Ranzorx: hilla could get an aq40 spot and prolly a few resets later be good for naxx
[0:50:58] R_GraM_: ppl always looking for shaman/priest/warrs in my experience
[0:51:12] haldaz: also I swear I played all of TBC and never realized they had lowered the price to 5, the whole reason I didnt copy was that I assumed it was always the 25 or whatever it was :'D
[0:51:14] Niksen_99: Just totem twist.. let the others heal
[0:51:29] Stone_Solid: the concept is, if you didn't want to play TBC - but say you wanted to come back Late TBC to prep for wotlk - you couldn't. What did blizzard gain by restricting this? why couldn't it had wait until WOTLK - ill have this discussion all day because blizz continues to piss the bed for no reason
[0:51:41] Enaji: Well, Salv is a "well know" pumper and serious guy, guilde often refrain themself to gear the "new guys" because they dont know him, in that case, they "know" him
[0:51:59] Stone_Solid: its the same issue I have with their practice now of 100% automated report systems with 0 real life GM intervention, pretty dogshit and lazy

[4:28:34] SaucekayTV: it's not real
[4:28:36] SaucekayTV: it can't hurt you
[4:28:49] maximus210793: @SalvDali what do you think about Traces of Silithyst invalidating logs?
[4:28:50] 451Fireman: everyone knows the real moba is heroes of newerth
[4:28:57] Uki88: lol is the fortnite of moba
[4:28:59] pm260: just use dynamite :)

[4:29:44] jlegretta: do they ban flask battleshout too? because that one is way more limited than sand buff
[4:29:56] crazystevelul: @Uki88 describes it well
[4:30:14] rogueclassic: PepeHands i member HoN was fun
[4:30:40] m33gz: yall know Smite still exists and iirc still regularly patching and updating the game
[4:30:43] ekiprkl: warcraftlogs sounds like a very consistent website
[4:30:43] 451Fireman: that one is weirdly out of LOS for some reason from what i remember
[4:31:19] ekiprkl: if they really want to make a difference invalidate the run if there's gnomes in the raid
[4:31:27] schwaybaby: dali pumpere
[4:31:29] bacconader: cleansed ashrbinger in there BatChest
[4:31:41] schwaybaby: dali pumpin going yodie in the 'holme
[4:32:34] rogueclassic: jokes aside i never understood why wcl decided with all the rules. just allow everything and see how degen people can get. so much more fun to watch. what's the point of artificially making it seem that normies can compete when its painfully obvious  they never will
[4:32:53] jlegretta: dwarf racial ofc
[4:33:21] cloudstrife543: no more greench in bfd
[4:33:37] yoooofi: trash requirements monkaS
[4:33:43] jlegretta: imagine if they voted to ban dmf
[4:33:53] Roomkaasje: It usually seemed like onslaught vs rest of speedrunners in wcl discord
[4:33:57] vlagori: TLDR: Dads hate world buffs
[4:34:07] Niksen_99: Just looked back on my old logs  from 2019 FeelsStrongMan
[4:34:17] Niksen_99: Good memories

[4:34:43] cloudstrife543: i actually died
[4:34:45] bacconader: @rogueclassic A bunch of dad gamers complaining that they couldnt compete if all buffs were allowed, acting as if there was that many serious competeters KEKL
[4:34:47] 3j55: weird to allow diamond flask quest but not sand buff
[4:35:03] maximus210793: @SalvDali are there more buffs (e.g. seasonal) which invalidate logs?
[4:35:13] bacconader: Oh but petris are also banned YEP
[4:35:16] Roomkaasje: @bacconader All top speedrunning guilds besides onslaught were in favor of banning it as well
[4:35:28] rogueclassic: @rogueclassic PepeHands always the lower common denominator in democracy. where's my proper meritocracy
[4:35:50] 3j55: p1 windsor parse buff was hilarious until they patched it
[4:36:26] Fallacy_o7: nice internet Kappa
[4:36:37] fandrox: Is it just me lagging?
[4:36:38] 451Fireman: yeah frame rate is a bit chunky
[4:36:45] cloudstrife543: 1-10 your love for bread
[4:36:51] R_GraM_: too many petri in a raid right?
[4:36:54] Fallacy_o7: oh shit really? Pog
[4:37:08] Fallacy_o7: or distilled wisdoms
[4:37:16] maximus210793: also sad that you cannot obain "Consecrated Sharpening Stone" for speedrunning anymore
[4:37:26] 3j55: also 40 out of combat petri, no worries
[4:37:31] Fallacy_o7: thought they did in bwl?
[4:37:31] jlegretta: did they ever invalidate using multiple flasks for mana?
[4:37:51] Pado99: imagine having man. only rage matters
[4:37:54] Pado99: mana*
[4:37:55] Roomkaasje: the green mana pot was discussed extensively as well but yeah since cant track properly it was allowed
[4:38:11] Fallacy_o7: onslaught using like 15 per lol
[4:38:31] bacconader: Imagine trying that in current era monkaW so much gold
[4:39:06] Fallacy_o7: rage is too strong of a resource,
[4:39:46] Roomkaasje: yeah worst part about people in favor of banning green mana pot as well was that it was all ally
[4:39:50] Roomkaasje: and it affects horde way more
[4:39:54] Fallacy_o7: KEKW
[4:40:05] Whitty: if you want to use a 500g mana pot, seems fine
[4:40:09] Niksen_99: 60g KEK
[4:40:15] 3j55: firemaw gromsblood is killing me
[4:40:19] 3j55: rage pots/titans
[4:40:21] ffz_ttv: why are there any wcl rules for era at all? they should just allow everyting.
[4:40:31] Fallacy_o7: lmao they renamed that
[4:40:37] ekiprkl: pearl necklace is offensive?

[4:40:39] ekiprkl: what the hell
[4:40:49] Fallacy_o7: fucking pc culture man ruining the world
[4:41:50] ekiprkl: i googled it but is that really something that people even know or relate it to?
[4:41:55] 451Fireman: does the guild help with green mana pots or is that on the healers only ?
[4:41:59] ekiprkl: never even heard of that
[4:42:03] m33gz: If you dont like pearl necklaces, you don't have to take it.  Its not like people are throwing them at your chest.
[4:42:10] rogueclassic: i mean the lack of the naxx event sharpening stones should eventually add up. the gear difference needed to make up for it would take a long ass time to farm for an entire raid
[4:43:21] skaboom17: wouldn't want to offend mentally ill narcissists with a reference to a pearl!
[4:43:55] Fallacy_o7: why is there no boat from menethil to southshore
[4:44:06] Fallacy_o7: or theramore i mean
[4:44:15] R_GraM_: how does the guild make gold for flasks
[4:44:21] Fallacy_o7: no i do mean menethil lol
