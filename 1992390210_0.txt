[0:45:15] AceOfHalo2: thats just stupid lol
[0:45:28] LancerVI: @AceOfHalo2 The vid I watched with devs said 40, because that would be mounts and 31 point talents

[1:55:58] damaherb: What do you think about a deep resto spec shaman tank. Your self healing can generate high threat, not to mention spend the excess mana from group pulls

[1:58:13] Kriskoo991: my feet?
[1:58:21] JerseyBricklayer: LUL shroudBnans
[1:58:23] Drkdream: @senji_live you usually spend a lot of mana to keep up aggro specially in aoe, it might change a bit on later levels as we get different runes through phases

[2:58:57] archer2342: @iam_akaria if you wanna play something like this, there is a private server called accession and it's really fun and free

[3:02:06] AceOfHalo2: @iam_akaria People do not work for free. Devs need to get paid to live. Thats what the sub system does. ALSO allowed the game to still be updated 20+ years later and for people to get paid to make new content. WIth out games there is no players.

[4:12:37] the_anderthal: unironically true
[4:12:41] Flobosama: @HVLN not really, there whole core theme is completely different, you cant truely make your class anything else than the class that it is
[4:12:46] chippymojo: shroudHype
[4:12:46] GrooveGrindGore: Gnomer bangs

[4:13:45] inflectz: logging into lone wolf eu and characters are gone :/
[4:13:45] HVLN: @Flobosama right, wasn't expecting classless/LRE levels, but more the ability modification. Maybe like rare REs
[4:13:50] imozrabbit: I want retail graphics tho
[4:14:02] the_anderthal: @inflectz same
[4:14:07] vibes819: I just can't enjoy the new art style of retail looks to cartoon ish to me
[4:14:15] WilleySlippery: @imozrabbit  retail graphics and animations are probably the worst things about it :D

[4:14:59] AceOfHalo2: But don't you want to help a fish up a waterfall?

[4:18:45] actionguyman: !server
[4:18:54] HighGrit: I love classic, but for some reason the fighting feels so much better in retail IMO. Somehow it doesn't feel like you're just mashing buttons.
[4:18:58] xhairbait: I think that means you don't have attention issues. I can't remember
[4:19:01] DivineDecay: Now do I roll horde or alliance NotLikeThis

[4:50:26] ItsGary: @Bloodhoven Thats exactly how they work and why you end up with queues.  More people are trying to get in then the server can handle, so it congests and slows down, it can only do so many actions a minute so it ends up filing you into a predicted queue with a predicted time.

[11:38:37] breadwilton: wowgrandma exists
[11:38:39] Qlief: story telling, world is better in classic man
[11:38:41] jibbitytibbit: everyone is old and they're not looking for a good game, they're looking to live in the old days.
[11:38:43] JovialNugs: retail better for people with less time or not wanna grind
[11:38:44] Emmune: retail is not new player friendly
[11:38:52] snaildaddy: retail can be that
[11:38:55] lucidml1: I don't like retail because of theme
[11:38:57] LGPalmz: @justjess thank fuck for that , thank you
[11:39:00] chilly81: are retail raids harder? i have no clue :)
[11:39:02] JustJess: npnp
[11:39:08] Rasjima: retail is like RS3
[11:39:12] Swiftyeezy_: retail is incredibly chill if you just avoid raids and m+ lol
[11:39:25] frriiedd: very much lol the player base of AN Y game gradually gets better the longer the game is out
[11:39:29] tmilla_89: pvp is pure sweat
[11:39:29] thaylondc: @Mahtzu what else would you do there LMAO
[11:39:39] drsqueakers: Ewwwwwwww classic wow
[11:39:39] wolfgodc: overly complex so boring
[11:39:41] drsqueakers: I should have known
[11:39:42] kjr59: is it harder than lost ark raiding?
[11:39:43] coomsicle_tv: retail just changed too much for people that started and got addicted to WoW in original vanilla in the 2000s, the raid and dungeon mechanics increased in difficulty  tenfold which is a good thing but with that, all the QoL changes made the game feel a lot less social and massive-multiplayer
[11:39:45] elhondro: retail is chill if you don't do raids and m+...so if you don 't play the game is chill LUL
[11:39:56] m7links: honestly tho retail not terrible but the nostalgia from classic hits different
[11:40:00] Rafaatho: this is my first MMO, SOD. having sun so far
[11:40:06] axell05: The secret for the drop is bigdick pull
[11:40:09] dustinb259: which u lick better of all 3 wows?
[11:40:10] coomsicle_tv: and thats why im an anti-retail scrooge. even tho mythic+ pushing seems fun ngl
[11:40:16] jibbitytibbit: retail has easier levelling but the levelling experience is so shit, everyone plays it for the endgame
[11:40:21] Bunster92: what ui is that
[11:40:21] Swiftyeezy_: @thaylondc pvp, mount farmin, theres plenty of casual content outside of m+ and raids lol
[11:40:35] ratlash: shaman can tank?
[11:40:38] elhondro: @coomsicle_tv is nothing fun in m+ push...doing the same dungeon for 6 months
[11:40:54] coomsicle_tv: @elhondro i primarily play arpgs so thats fun to me LUL
[11:40:55] ClassicWorldOfWarcraft: it depends on what parts of the games you compare. If its endgame raiding youre right
[11:40:55] Kolsonsm: Anyone know what map preset he uses in sexymap? Cant seem to find the one that matches
[11:40:57] axell05: Bigdick pull = drop
[11:41:00] dfnn1: !level

[11:41:04] dustinb259: which version of wow u like best?
[11:41:35] Kid_Lightning: lama burst
[11:41:48] tmilla_89: retail is stale
[11:41:48] Elceecruz04: Nice goatee @shroud
[11:41:50] thaylondc: @coomsicle_tv it is fun if you have a team to play with and want to be a better player
[11:41:50] cvkarrosh: wat
[11:41:51] jremi94: @elhondro You do know every wow you play classic or retail.... you do the same shit over and over lol
[11:41:56] m7links: the best ? HOT TAKE
[11:41:57] Kid_Lightning: no way
[11:41:57] MvP_OO7: it’s December bro . why didn’t u shave that shit yet
[11:41:59] dustinb259: yea retail is acctually sooo good right now
[11:42:04] jibbitytibbit: gatekeeping and toxic pugs makes hard content even harder
[11:42:06] NastyDarski: !addon

[11:42:08] LoneRangers: retail is button inflation
[11:42:14] jaiyelon: can smo in chat lmk bc this looks mad confusing. would I be able to understand it like LoL bc I thought that game was confusing but it’s pretty fun now
[11:42:19] Breakk: @shroud what made you change your mind? i swear you used to say classic easily wiithin the last year
[11:42:19] coomsicle_tv: i think Cata is a good balance of actual challenging raid mechanics and old feeling of woW. looking forward to classic Cata tbh
[11:42:20] bb0rg: PvP is actually great right now with Solo Shuffle
[11:42:23] Bliskin: @jibbitytibbit you don't get gatekept if you don't suck
[11:42:24] dustinb259: pretty sick shroud plays wow now
[11:42:28] coomsicle_tv: im biased tho i quit in MoP
[11:42:31] ClassicWorldOfWarcraft: retail has more difficult mechanics on bosses, at the same time its bloated with addons, helpers and QoL left and right
[11:42:33] OneTimeACraft: @jaiyelon super simple
[11:42:41] cleancutbruda: i dont think pve dps is correct. ret does too much damage
[11:42:42] Elceecruz04: @jibbitytibbit join a guild maybe?
[11:42:45] Kid_Lightning: legion was pretty tight
[11:42:46] slashnox: chat is SoD on hardcore?
[11:42:48] oloddl: u got the ring ?;D
[11:42:59] Heetz23: it always amazed me how people said, retail is imposible to learn, and then you have wowgrandma78, doing m+ 20+ keys playing rdruid
[11:43:02] agent_alpaca: FeelsLagMan
[11:43:08] jaiyelon: @onetimeacraft it just looks like sooo much like all the things at the bottom the mobs everything
[11:43:15] hate_xyz: @slashnox no, its normal
[11:43:21] jibbitytibbit: @Bliskin the problem is it's not about being good, it's about your numbers being higher than the top 1%. but even then you get gatekept
[11:43:26] nilbusmaximus: @jibbitytibbit Gatekeeping? lol, the only thing gatekept is mythic raid, which isn't designed for the average person
[11:43:30] w00d90: retail has made the game to easy for new players to get gear fast, also with pvp gear. its  to easy overall now.
[11:43:38] Fossabot: Follow Mike on Twitter https://twitter.com/shroud

[11:43:55] OneTimeACraft: @jaiyelon when you go through the leveling process everything comes naturally to you
[11:44:03] jaiyelon: ohh okay thx
[11:44:04] chazemoto: takes about 8+ hours
[11:44:10] abood_fh1: hows shaman tank?
[11:44:15] coomsicle_tv: @thaylondc yeah i enjoy pushing/competing on pve leaderboards with a guild that takes gaming somewhat seriously so mythic+ would be the content id do if  i played retail, but im never gonna play retail tbh. def gonna play SoD tho
[11:44:20] Kid_Lightning: retail doesnt have that gear finding feeling. i want stuff to be rare as hell
[11:44:28] jibbitytibbit: @Elceecruz04 pugs should be regulated, i don't want to organize meetups with guilds that could take a long time just to play the game
[11:44:28] iinstigatee: PUBG???
[11:44:30] dustinb259: yea thee way gear now is great
[11:44:30] w00d90: it takes away the grind and thats what was interesting about wow
[11:44:31] mursham120: what ui is that
[11:44:31] nilbusmaximus: @shroud The nerf to BM is 3-4% Single Target, and 5-6% AOE, its not gonna be that big of a deal
[11:44:45] dustinb259: nothing wrong with kinda fast loot due to alts
[11:44:45] Robben4: retails needs to decide whether to design content for no addons or to integrate most addons into the game. you cant keep making people set up weakauras for hours to do m+ or raid mythic
[11:44:48] FoxezNSoxez: @w00d90 show me the problem
[11:44:49] w00d90: you can max gear super fast now and just move on to another game if you're not super commited
[11:44:50] savvy_gg: considering how much bloat therer is with all the expansions that haave passed retail is doing pretty good
[11:44:54] snaildaddy: its a good thing, but it ruins the awe of gear to me
[11:45:02] killakplive: we got the exact same lvl group boosting a shaman rn in wc too
[11:45:07] cleancutbruda: @nilbusmaximus meh its lvl 25 nerfs
[11:45:12] Rimy: @mursham120 !addon
[11:45:12] snaildaddy: like it used to be sick to see people in heroic wrath gear and pre nerf tbc gear

[11:45:29] killakplive: na
[11:45:37] killakplive: oldgrey is his name
[11:45:40] FoxezNSoxez: @w00d90 maybe the game has more to it than gearing, also, its still months of work lol
[11:45:42] killakplive: easy bfd group in 2 hour
[11:45:44] coomsicle_tv: thats where people fundamentally disagree too. i preferred the slow progression in old wow and old arpgs before seasons, min maxing, etc. i dont like char boosts or sitting in dungeon que to level to cap from the moment i create my character
[11:45:46] killakplive: max
[11:45:47] Gurgi234: meaningful gear? LUL

[11:50:11] RevenantEQ: classic wow gave you the opportunity to be as chill or as hardcore as you wanted to be. worse, retail wow has over a period of years developed a community that reinforces hardcore gameplay as the only "valuable" form of gaming. the only escape from that mindset is to play solo, which a lot of retail players are forced to do now if they want to chill or play at all.

[11:55:38] Fossabot: @vx33 Here's a list of his WoW addons - https://clips.twitch.tv/SmoggySparklingDogeJebaited-lehmYUO3a1pHMIbT
[11:55:53] clancylegit: shaman aoe tanking seems broken at this level ngl
[11:55:55] Ermius_: @coomsicle_tv u heard about vuhdo?
[11:55:55] monotyc: does wow officially count as a mental disease?
[11:56:02] clancylegit: you dont lose threat at all
[11:56:10] coomsicle_tv: @Ermius_ np. healing is EZ in classic and id argue in general and quite fun too, the hover-cast takes some getting used to. some people heal without it and manually target ppl, salute, not for me tho.
[11:56:18] korgishy: he is the top dps, no way he loses threat
[11:56:34] Jovisback: what is this fire armor ?
[11:56:50] Dudaz_: epic gamer moment
[11:56:51] BurritooBoii: !addon

[11:56:55] coomsicle_tv: @Ermius_ ofc. not sure if it works here again, SoD being a different version might break a lot of addons. mostly looks like it doesnt though since its still running on 1.15 (iirc?) patch
[11:56:59] Ermius_: @coomsicle_tv u suggest holy space for priest on classic?

[11:59:10] TioPhilJoga: Is this Gordon Freeman?
[11:59:12] coomsicle_tv: @Ermius_ im def not the person to ask class suggestion when it comes to healers since i have not researched beyond shaman, paladin, warrior and hunter so far lol. i did see that resto druid is looking very viable as a raid wide healer tho i dont recall why or whatt rune
[11:59:14] 1njectionz: Mom let me stay up, made a bet with her I'd get level 30 tonight, or I'll blow my step dad, that's how confident I am
[11:59:16] Kid_Lightning: i have been playing hardcore so long i automatically play like that in SOD without realizing i can die
