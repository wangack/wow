[1:41:38] Father_rat: interacting with other players is part of the game
[1:41:45] solartech0: @StreamFollower Right, but there's a decent chance that some people who came back for that first month might actually stick around if they didn't hit that heavy attrition point right at the start. And even if they *don't* stick around, they won't have that negative experience with your product (possibly even fond memories of that month!) and might be more likely to pay / come back for your future offerings.

[6:06:52] Et3rnalife: @RoyaL_Foster The season isnt out for a bit right?
[6:07:00] aabirin: @singsing just so you know, spectres are really annoying. The new spectres are quite limited and cannot be desecrated. You can absolutely lose them randomly like if you unequip an amulet and suddenly don't have attributes, or if you take chest off to craft
[6:07:09] Guko97: fallingzombies

[6:07:36] Tooban: Ghazzy had a good point for the spectres. That if you remove your ring or something you will lose them all if you lose str or dex for support gems

[6:09:31] Eko08: @tabondhimek oh you meant in his case?
[6:09:32] Yakobro: they added spectre corpses to desecrate but they specifically said the corpses you buy aren't added

[13:56:02] hmsrepulse: also it's legit that tanking 5 mans aren't so bad
[13:56:07] WaviestDragoon: Shirley
[13:56:09] Bebop_Bob: PJSalt
[13:56:09] relyk5: 5g activates the covid chip right?
[13:56:09] hmsrepulse: with sp trinket
[13:56:09] Eon_Ltd: Yeah paladin healers and tanks take all the caster dps gear, just how it is
[13:56:10] yusba: need it for my next character !
[13:56:12] Manlaser: He is so salty wow
[13:56:12] byited: raiz KEK
[13:56:12] mawhulk: ????
[13:56:21] snjegu: I swear i have no clue what Carn is saying
[13:56:22] Xozne: zara PepeLaugh
[13:56:24] poopsmith412: Now they die cuz they distracted by loot drama
[13:56:26] Shootles: i agree with raiz
[13:56:27] WaviestDragoon: idk
[13:56:28] KrunkleDunk: then you won't find tanks
[13:56:29] KrbyCC: @liebessaft yea but like carn said he offered the tank pants to carn too
[13:56:30] KrunkleDunk: or healers
[13:56:33] blimo: he is right this how wow works
[13:56:33] Zhyren: is raiz always as anal LUL
[13:56:36] metagory: ok, next time decide on loot rules BEFORE the dungeon
[13:56:40] zeronjk: man is salty af
[13:56:40] ifailedbad: its gauntlet its what ever
[13:56:42] S_H_O_D_A_N: @Zhyren yes PepeLaf
[13:56:43] DuKeIt0uT: council fight
[13:56:43] Eon_Ltd: Pallys and caster dps want the same gear
[13:56:45] ifailedbad: just kill the dorfs
[13:56:46] liebessaft: @KrbyCC yeah, but carn didnt just roll for them
[13:56:46] Exooodus: easy fight
[13:56:47] chocostarphish: i mean, i think the easiest way is if you are gonna equip it immediately, you can need roll, and if it's boe, everyone need rolls cuz everyone needs gold
[13:56:55] Zhyren: it's great
[13:56:57] Gems_ldn: big items here if I recall
[13:57:04] Nightbot: Also live streaming now on Youtube for those that prefer it! https://www.youtube.com/@WehSing/streams
[13:57:16] ells07: i would never tank in dungeons if I cant roll for heal gear for raids
[13:57:20] Bamsemums313: Man, can he just let it go. Carn was the 2nd on the roll anywways
[13:57:22] WaviestDragoon: monkaW
[13:57:27] heyitsMart: !cast
[13:57:27] Eko08: raiz is wrong
[13:57:28] Skwishi: heyitsMart has caught a fish called the IcedAnt for 1 angler points. OOOO
[13:57:36] hmsrepulse: bro this some classic loot drama KEK
[13:57:36] KrunkleDunk: carn is wrong there
[13:57:39] Zhyren: raiz is trying so hard with what ifs
[13:57:45] liebessaft: nah, raiz is right. he should've announced it earlier or asked if it was okay to roll for it
[13:57:45] elimud: hes a paladin hes healing at lvl 60 aint no ifs ands or buts KEK
[13:57:46] Tooban: You would never find a tank if those were the rules...
[13:57:46] hartwall: https://clips.twitch.tv/IgnorantDignifiedLlamaImGlitch-P9XMVRPn0Pvj2Dfr
[13:57:53] Nostraz: BabyRage
[13:57:53] metagory: it's because raiz lost a ton of rolls on good loot earlier, so the cumulative losses are building the salt
[13:57:53] Bebop_Bob: lootdrama feelsgoodman
[13:57:56] YourKingCrowley: its legit if he asks other people before a dungeon, kinda bad manners after item drop to roll need
[13:57:57] S_H_O_D_A_N: this discussion is gonna get someone killed singsingKekw
[13:57:59] n3ther: Saying beforehand is best
[13:57:59] Shootles: you say it at the start if he's rolling for healer gear or for prot gear
[13:57:59] KrbyCC: @liebessaft that is true but its not like he should give it up just because
[13:58:02] Nightbot: Banned users will not be able to view stream anymore. Which means backseating = ban = no sing. Don't backseat
[13:58:03] rexOn124: TUMADRE is wrong chat superDab
[13:58:04] Shootles: can't just roll for everyspec
[13:58:08] WaviestDragoon: i just remembered why i dont play mmos
[13:58:19] liebessaft: @KrbyCC he shouldnt have needed in the first place. that's just rude
[13:58:26] mawhulk: carn is right if you think casually but for min max raiz is right
[13:58:26] hmsrepulse: bro lvl solo can't play healer
[13:58:30] BaxxyChan: Can someone explain to this warlock that spellpower is awesome for tank paladin?
[13:58:31] Zhyren: I think he doesn't realize paladins can only heal later
[13:58:35] Gems_ldn: Raiz is milking the drama :D
[13:58:37] ifailedbad: Im a raid monke so I have very clear opinion on this soits hard to undersand what are they even talking about
[13:58:40] relyk5: heal the doge
[13:58:48] yusba: i think in this case its ok to need for heal because its so close to 60. but in the middle of leveling not as much
[13:58:49] byited: KEK
[13:58:49] solartech0: @ifailedbad KEKW
[13:58:50] KrbyCC: @liebessaft i mean carn is explaining it now tho, dude prolly playing tank cos he solo
[13:58:54] nerothecaptain: how come Singu streamed for 14 hours today?
[13:58:55] Gon_Dola: @ifailedbad What's the verdict?
[13:58:58] relyk5: this is some late night loot drama lol
[13:59:01] Gon_Dola: what even happened?
[13:59:01] Nightbot: Check out the new Path of Exile expansion here! - https://www.pathofexile.com/affliction/2EA9utkWD4
[13:59:03] AimlessArt: Well, its not strange to hear about loot a full week later Classic
[13:59:10] andima88: Carn GIGACHAD LISSEN
[13:59:13] Gems_ldn: prepare for more drama on the chest :D
[13:59:17] solartech0: I mean it makes sense that he wants to roll for what he is progressing towards
[13:59:19] metagory: he was going to hop off, but they found a tank for BRD at the last minute, but BRD = 3h dungeon
[13:59:21] WaviestDragoon: carn is Clueless
[13:59:25] liebessaft: @KrbyCC yeah, but it is still an off role roll. so you dont "just roll" if there's two people who need the gear in main roll
[13:59:25] Gems_ldn: Ohh hamer
[13:59:27] ynthegra: Muted
[13:59:33] Gems_ldn: more drama
[13:59:33] yusba: isnt priest dmg and heal gear the same gear
[13:59:38] patience_from_zhou_: hello bros
[13:59:40] yusba: they give both damage and heal?
[13:59:43] bruusk: hammer of grace is great
[13:59:43] YourKingCrowley: i hate people like raiz who are butthurt over some brd gear
[13:59:45] EMCQable: his situation makes sense and the roll is valid IF HE COMMUNICATES beforehand, otherwise it's kind of shit imo
[13:59:46] Joxedin: healing mace is sick
[13:59:49] hmsrepulse: hammer of grace is pretty sick for carn
[13:59:52] Flashby: that hammer > sword
