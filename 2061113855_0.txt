[0:05:42] Dzor12: Hello
[0:05:49] Joneim: Mondays frag
[0:05:58] Cohen_Carmine: papa?
[0:06:03] ink131_: yeah usher is hot
[0:06:04] wraghelm: What the hell is the super bowl and who won
[0:06:06] Dzor12: It was okay, like 7/19
[0:06:08] AzzaHub: Rotonda
[0:06:09] Elseworldz: Nah sports is icky
[0:06:10] Dzor12: 7/10*
[0:06:24] BigTheTank: it was pretty good, first half sucked second was very entertaining
[0:06:35] Clarius: Pog
[0:06:36] Dzor12: Yeah, 4th Q and OT was what saved it for me
[0:06:36] callmegort: what is this sports ball?
[0:06:41] TommySeeker: yo
[0:06:41] leubinator: three bad quarters into a banger ending to bad it only became good at 4 am KEKW
[0:06:51] ink131_: should probably pin that message for sure
[0:06:52] wraghelm: I want to offer you a lower price than that guy. Better quality, better everything. More custom settings
[0:07:03] ztraws__: i really want to copy pasta that but will for sure get sniped
[0:07:15] Jowk95: rough to watch superbowl with all the ads
[0:07:25] TommySeeker: only those that abuse get caught
[0:07:38] Eltved3: title is fire as always
[0:07:53] Linith_Heart: i am a viewer and a bot YEP
[0:07:57] TommySeeker: viewbot like 25% of your real view
[0:08:17] TehWongWay: monday garf
[0:08:25] leubinator: monday garf
[0:08:36] Cohen_Carmine: likev 6 inches i think
[0:08:37] wraghelm: If you watched me in M+ you couldn't say you aren't viewbotting rn
[0:08:58] Elseworldz: I was about to say....
[0:08:59] PurpleKami: yeah people with pretty uncaring viewerbases
[0:08:59] Olivruh: u might not be viewbotting but ur viewers (me) are bots
[0:09:04] ShaggySummers: Oh yeah. Nobody cares
[0:09:09] TehWongWay: is infamy sucess?
[0:09:11] THEprinkus: HAH EVERYONE LOOK THIS GUY IS VIEWBOTTING HAH
[0:09:27] deviljin____: ethically, whats the difference between embedding and view botting tbh
[0:09:35] xGamingWithMusic: maybe not viewbotting but remember flexi had twitch on a small screen on their website
[0:09:36] OG_Kawngi: HAH exposed
[0:09:36] Itchy43: no care
[0:09:44] ShaggySummers: 7 ads hahaha fu twitch im out
[0:09:46] santalylth: great content on the poddy c today
[0:09:50] Tooyoo: no one cares
[0:09:50] wraghelm: I'd be like "his content slaps so hard that fuckin robots watch it - respect"
[0:09:50] ink131_: p sure that one dude from the G4TV show got exposed big time i forget his name, besides that its almost always speculation
[0:09:51] NattyPally: i wouldnt give a fuck, i mean youd get memed on but i watch you for you and your content
[0:09:52] Guffels: idk you survived the ff14 thing. i dont think people care
[0:09:58] exage_: There hasn't been any confirmed, just stuff like trainwrecks claiming it
[0:10:00] santalylth: goes so well with sod leveling
[0:10:02] Dzor12: I wouldn't care if you viewbotted tbh
[0:10:12] Lilalime: ye ppl dont care at least not for long i think
[0:10:12] exage_: top streamers doing it
[0:10:16] Fray24_: I would never watch you again plus tweet very mad things about it
[0:10:19] exage_: was the claim
[0:10:27] Tooyoo: it doesn't affect the stream to us
[0:10:29] toastbam: nah
[0:10:31] wraghelm: *whispers that guy to start viewbotting immediately*
[0:10:31] Joneim: Idk, content doesnt change
[0:10:33] deviljin____: It is
[0:10:35] Dzor12: I watch your stream because you are entertaining to me
[0:10:35] TommySeeker: I think at first i wouldn't care but with time I would slowly lose trust in whatever you say
[0:10:36] NattyPally: its pathetic? yeah for sure, but youre a real on
[0:10:37] Olivruh: why does viewbotting matter. like who cares
[0:10:39] Dzor12: Not because of your viewer number
[0:10:49] Elseworldz: People's memories are short as hell. They'd forget and stop caring in a week or two.
[0:10:52] toastbam: no?
[0:10:59] OlaF_oo: why would it matter, more viewers results in better content (maybe)
[0:11:04] Adrillon: Heres the thing, wether you viewbot or not, it doesnt change the content. So if you like the content then viewbotting or not wouldn't change anything. Sure Id think its scummy. But doesn't change what I personally enjoy.
[0:11:08] deviljin____: We like you so we cannot envision a non biased reality
[0:11:09] Tooyoo: I never look at how many viewers are watching a streamer i enjoy watching
[0:11:11] toastbam: i dont judge a person by their business
[0:11:12] daevyfan: you're a second monitor streamer, we're your viewbots
[0:11:21] VegiXTV: as a viewer, idc about viewbotting. it's between the streamer and twitch imo
[0:11:26] Linith_Heart: its like removing the luck factor when getting started i think
[0:11:27] wraghelm: Can we have a paid feature to buy you viewbots instead of subbing
[0:11:30] Lilalime: you could get viewbotted without even knowing it
[0:11:36] TommySeeker: same with pretty much any real crime and yet..
[0:11:40] exage_: The type of content you provide wouldn't be affected by it, but larger twitch community would look at it poorly
[0:11:43] papesoul: It's a fallacy. It's not because you have more or less viewers that your views and opinions are more or less good.
[0:12:01] daevyfan: also watch on theater mode and cant even see the viewcount
[0:12:20] deviljin____: People think content is all that matters until its someone they want to dislike, and in that case a lot of other things matter too
[0:12:26] Javiz: Howdy Max
[0:12:27] Tyldorx: will 10.2.6 be some sick pirate shit?
[0:12:42] Dzor12: I think you're underestimating how much stuff people will overlook to be entertained
[0:13:15] daevyfan: the garage streams was the best streams tho

[0:18:07] mab_music_ttrpg: normal, you are 30 ain't working like 10 years ago, you need to stay active, cardio wise

[0:18:18] brokenfar: progress isnt always linear sadly :(
[0:18:24] daevyfan: enough sun?
[0:18:27] Linith_Heart: got washed in 1 week
[0:18:33] BigTrout3: is it catchup from going so hard? you've been working out and playing hockey nearly everyday
[0:18:39] Midniyt: just finished season 1 of foundation, goes so hard, may have to binge season 2
[0:18:42] exage_: shoulda told yourself to lock it in
[0:18:46] TommySeeker: why not skate on your backyard ice
[0:18:55] itsrhinobruh: did your get motw before skate.    vers is huge
[0:19:01] THEprinkus: sometimes you just slump.  don't play hockey but play basketball and i'd imagine it's just like showing up and you're bricking every shot
[0:19:19] Itchy43: its like the + and - 5% dmg diff, just on the body
[0:19:22] Laffitaffi11: id say lifting heavy isnt the best for hockey anymore. go lighter but faster workout movments
[0:19:23] ink131_: idk diff day diff menty, sometimes my lifts are crazy sometimes they arent, i eat same food at the same time everyday, etc, we r still human
[0:19:29] kelly_mac06: @Midniyt it is SO fucking good
[0:19:36] BigTrout3: recovery includes *not* doing something, not just getting 8 hours of sleep
[0:19:39] Fray24_: i run pretty consistently and if i go a week without running I can really feel it that first day
[0:19:47] misterwinoe: Your nervous system gets overloaded
[0:19:49] upmysleeeves: you're prob dying, rip garf
[0:19:53] mab_music_ttrpg: if you are spending your days sitting, and you are lifting heavy with no cardio, its normal
[0:19:58] misterwinoe: you're going hard in the gym and a heavy cardio sport
[0:19:59] turtleulty: i looked up ur symptoms on WebMD and it looks like u are dying soon. its been real o7
[0:20:31] kaychixo: o7
[0:20:34] upmysleeeves: you can build up systemic fatigue
[0:20:36] misfitstv1: so you’re describing CNS recovery
[0:20:40] upmysleeeves: so you need to deload
[0:20:44] PaCozzz: post-nut workout sloppyness Kappa
[0:20:45] tydrera: its bean real o7
[0:20:45] misterwinoe: I was llike that today, i lifted heavy for like 2 or 3 days then ate like shit for the super bowl LOL
[0:21:02] surpriseparty20: After I haven't done an exercise for a couple of days if I don't strech well I get fucked up
[0:21:06] toastbam: It just means you are dying
[0:21:11] wraghelm: The body is so fickle
[0:21:12] tydrera: sounds like a stretch issue, better dynamic stretches + more ROM
[0:21:13] rhino_u: maybe you're just getting old. I'm also getting old Sadge
[0:21:14] GelatoSquid: diet/sleep is such a huge factor people underrate it
[0:21:16] TommySeeker: broccoli or cauliflowers?
[0:21:17] ShaggySummers: sleep, hydration, overtraining, illness.. so many possibilities
[0:21:24] brokenfar: nah i played high level hockey - heavy lifting up to a point is also important
[0:21:30] daevyfan: definitely just an age thing, max is like 70
[0:21:31] Squats3: old
[0:21:32] BigTrout3: you're burning the candle at both ends and with lighter fuel
[0:21:36] misterwinoe: broccoli all day player
[0:21:39] itsrhinobruh: just blame the hockey devs
[0:21:41] ShaggySummers: just accept that this will happen from time to time
[0:21:41] jazzyjoey: hockey is hiit. you could have also went too hard in your first few drills. it can shock your system if you dont warm up into it

[0:32:16] ShaggySummers: Of course it's good. it's growl

[0:32:51] GelatoSquid: there's a fun video called "why diablo 4 players hate last epoch" that people have been reacting to
[0:32:55] BigTrout3: where's the sandwich alignment chart?
[0:33:05] Clarius: CONTENT

[0:34:06] Goodnevi1: That view count
[0:34:06] Joneim: Wont someone think about the streamer
[0:34:10] Taytor: youtube premium $$$
[0:34:15] turfjitsu: so selfish not making videos for you to restream xD
[0:34:16] Taytor: watch time for youtube permium farms money
[0:34:20] TehWongWay: I watch stuff like that unironically when im working on stuff
[0:34:26] cajovysacok: he wasted 10 milion of houns of people life
[0:34:38] Clarius: oh true thats so smart
[0:34:49] Jazzarus_: 5Head
[0:34:49] Piki9: open incognito mode to  see how many ads
[0:35:00] LucasSterling_: nah its fucked, some ads are loud as shit and they wake me up
[0:35:07] daiger5o: How ad revenue works with premium isers?
[0:35:11] Mipolol: so what happened to Dratty's tooth? :/
[0:35:20] Mazmerized: Korthia and then thats it
[0:35:30] Jazzarus_: gold for legendaries if you dont buy tokens
[0:35:33] KaisenSiru: Embercourt weekly grind
[0:35:34] sebby997: Renown, the artifact thingy?
[0:35:36] HeffaBear: dont long videos get automatically frontloaded with like an ad every 3-5 mins for the first hour?
[0:35:37] cajovysacok: top 10 genders if it would be about ganders
[0:35:43] swagggle: Veilstrider has to be #1
[0:36:02] kakebuts: jesus
[0:36:06] tomato26: @Maximum do you think that the new rep system in War withing will affect in the race a lot?
[0:36:09] sebby997: He didnt really stop, he just has another channel about Yu GI Oh thats doing pretty good too
[0:36:10] wommy: i love hirumaredx
[0:36:11] theskot: people like lore
[0:36:12] dknamey: Sleep deprived boomers
[0:36:14] ShaggySummers: Also people will watch the "to fall asleep to" videos on their phones... with the app.... without adblock @Maximum
[0:36:14] daiger5o: Banger lore
[0:36:18] LucasSterling_: he probably farmed the asmr community
[0:36:19] highcard2: yeah you gotta step up your yt game man
[0:36:35] CMCam1: people will fall asleep within 10 minutes then play it again the day after
[0:36:36] cajovysacok: top 10 top 10 top 10 top 10 LUL
[0:36:51] highcard2: your vids are great just post more lol
[0:36:52] surpriseparty20: People just like lore. Doesn't matter which game tbh
[0:36:55] Pyrrha_GG: the ultimate strat is make videos that your audience likes
[0:36:57] CoffeeASAP: ALOO
[0:37:02] sebby997: PlatinumWoW has really good videos too
[0:37:08] yungturbo__: everyone who does PvE has huge respect for your opinion it's not that surprising
[0:37:15] Pyrrha_GG: typical chatter
[0:37:21] cajovysacok: he whould make top 10 people out of these  3 people
[0:37:22] flabstv: rep is shared across characters right
[0:37:25] DunzoCD: think he means account wide rep
[0:37:28] tomato26: reps being account wide, or am i wrong?
[0:37:29] surpriseparty20: About that warband shit ?
[0:37:48] tomato26: my bad I worded it wierd
[0:37:57] Pyrrha_GG: prob just wont attached any impactful power to them like they did in 10.2
[0:38:04] nellfin: i would assume rep has a weekly cap account wide in war within
[0:38:16] MeisterChiefX: there is zero world where mythic gear is boa
[0:38:35] swaseytv: they said it’s only dragon flight and war within rep that is shared in the beginning
[0:38:39] larkhill: does faithfather make it into max's warband?
[0:38:51] Nickystr1x: it'll likely start out at a lower ilvl tier until a couple months in
[0:38:59] Pyrrha_GG: they said it will always be about 1 tier lower than the content you are doing, so mythic gives herioc etc.
[0:38:59] fuchai: i feel mythic plus is the go to for gearing up quickly for first raid
[0:39:04] LucasSterling_: or u raid log
[0:39:17] larkhill: or u still need a legendary
[0:39:18] wraghelm: I would kill someone to get 15 crests per dungeon
[0:39:20] SachroTV: give us the power to upgrade from like Hero to Myth track for like 100 aspects or whatever
[0:39:22] Dzor12: It should be faster for sure
[0:39:28] relicz: getting crests right now on alts is ridiculous
[0:39:42] KaisenSiru: Mythic Fyrakk kills and still no legendary Sadge
[0:39:48] Haarmless: abosolutely, upgrades should get flightstone and crest discounts ramping per week
[0:40:01] koxytwitch: if you are late, you are shafted by vault 4/4 gear anyway
[0:40:02] zysmos: i think there is no reason why the outgrowing crests requirements is not account wide
[0:40:06] Lilurrn: crests are horrible to gear alts with right now
[0:40:09] yungturbo__: that's how it always should have been
[0:40:11] Snydezz: We are on mythic Fyrakk right now, and I would love that
[0:40:18] Pyrrha_GG: but then i cant tell who is beans in LFG
[0:40:19] Touchpadwarrior: aspect crest rate buff/drops for alts would feel great
[0:40:25] wraghelm: I have like 4 characters at the point of gearing where they just need 400 aspect crests
[0:40:32] highcard2: i think they were saying blizz wont do it, not that its bad
[0:40:35] lolwhateverdog: transferring crests to other characters would be easy and solid addition too
[0:40:35] menzlo: Account bound crests would do that, just when they become useless on main you could give to alt
[0:40:36] fuchai: so from blizz stand point if everyone just goes straight into higher keys it makes not so skilled players who wanna do low keys unable to find anyone to que with
[0:40:39] sohjesussalva: mine is always irrelevant
[0:40:44] nellfin: should just make crests and flightstones BoA and rather have a weekly cap on how many you can USE instead of how many you can acquire per character
[0:40:46] turfjitsu: I want to be able to gear a toon to max in a few hours that would be great  especially late into a season
[0:40:50] scilencedh: geared up an aug evoker last night. went from 424 ah gear to 470 in one night. gearing ain’t that bad right now.
[0:40:51] Ellasande: Ellasande subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 4 months, currently on a 4 month streak! evening
[0:40:56] StanRaenslen: ooh yes, lost ark system of "required" alt army
[0:41:02] NotD4k: giving terts
[0:41:06] nightst314: bad gating, nope
[0:41:07] koxytwitch: warbandbound pls
[0:41:07] fuchai: no shot they will do that
[0:41:29] Eleemz: For m+ it would be nice if we could get avoidance or leech tokens
[0:41:30] nightst314: stop turning this into a turbo grind game
[0:41:34] Camelbak21: Why can't there be tertiary stats from vault tokens? It sucks to be fucked over by never getting avoidance on gear etc
[0:41:40] SachroTV: That would be sick ngl
[0:41:47] wraghelm: No thats a good take max
[0:41:55] SVT_Dexter: It's a good take don't get one guyed
[0:41:55] Vsplague: Nah its a good cook
[0:41:56] BigTrout3: HUH
[0:42:01] StanRaenslen: m+ers will obsess over that for avoidance
[0:42:02] AoPsyke: didn't he just say the opposite? lmao
[0:42:02] Joneim: Reading / Listening comprehension is a shockingly rare skill
[0:42:09] fuchai: i think he means you would vault on tons of toons to try to funnel to one
[0:42:13] wraghelm: It's ALREADY a grind to gear a new alt with a million crest requirement
[0:42:14] Rafal_to_ja: just give us dinars 3 months into season
[0:42:14] nightst314: doing nothing with a character and getting it geared feels weird
[0:42:15] BigTrout3: firstGarf
[0:42:16] Pyrrha_GG: medium rare cook
[0:42:16] Dreos123: this would be less grinding? you already have to do 100 dungeons for a new char right now how is trading gear more grinding
[0:42:18] SachroTV: @StanRaenslen So would healers for leech, who cares its 3m in
[0:42:20] StanRaenslen: ask dorki his op
[0:42:23] Lyhavoc: its an mmo its gonna be grindy tho. later in the season i see this being good
[0:42:24] ShaggySummers: they are talking about the funneling gear early season @Maximum
[0:42:31] Clevelandmk: people stop playing cause they are full stuff in 3 weeks now
[0:42:32] zannuss: I'm late to the chat, what we talking about
[0:42:32] Linith_Heart: gearing up an alt with no one to carry you is too much of a pain for a normal person
[0:42:33] Camelbak21: Bro some people get full avoid gear and shit on people without it, it sucks to not be able to spend tokens to put it on gear, literally a trash rng system
[0:42:34] koxytwitch: call ion NOW
[0:42:36] koxytwitch: Madge
[0:42:41] Clevelandmk: and they just don't enjoy being stuck at max ilvl
[0:42:43] exage_: beyond any of that, they need to reproach the remaining classes that don't feel fun to play. gear is great but its not going the be the reason people keep playing past a certain point
[0:42:43] Ruinx81: People gatekeeping wow at end of season lmao
[0:42:54] fuchai: all this is cool and stuff but how about the mount you get to build?
[0:43:01] Keppie__: I dont like it if you feel like you cant start on new char cause you would be forever behind
[0:43:05] highcard2: i support this if ret pallies get buffed
[0:43:07] GrimmshadoXI: @Lyhavoc What does that even mean? Any game relying on grind as "content" is a scam
[0:43:08] Joneim: Yup, i have zero reason to even do 20's anymore. Cant get any upgrades anymore
[0:43:13] zannuss: I got some many aspect crests rotting on my main and my 3 alts would love em
[0:43:21] koxytwitch: i mean how hard would it be to give more crest and flightstone
[0:43:22] shareandcare: how do I give my double time warglaive to my random warlock alt though?
[0:43:25] Snydezz: @Maximum You know what's amazing... Having 315 aspect crests on your main and nothing to spend them on
[0:43:25] koxytwitch: changing 2 valuables
[0:43:26] StreamElements: Subscribe to HelloFresh and use my code POGHF121355 to receive one free breakfast item per box while subscription is active https://strms.net/hellofresh_maximum #ad
[0:43:31] Razdruid: I think the biggest gripe I have is they keep fixing the "tech" but wont fix things that are clearly bugs like the double tick on 2nd boss on fall
[0:43:31] fuchai: 3k is the new KSM
[0:43:36] KeyboardDeath: So acct bound gear?
[0:43:39] Pyrrha_GG: i don't think they want that level of degenerate potential for title pushers etc., but since its so few people that shouldn't matter but that's how they feel
[0:43:40] upmysleeeves: isn't that always how it is
[0:43:41] Heavontv: what if they made aspect crests worth more?
[0:43:45] roookai: @GrimmshadoXI poe is a scam
[0:44:03] Keppie__: It is kinda like the coruption cloak where you get the feeling of being foreever behind
[0:44:03] HeffaBear: people who want to do the bare minimum already win a lot in wow, let people who play the game do degen shit tbh
[0:44:11] drazzil7: But right now its the opposite, end of expansion feeling bad because gearing new fun alts are still slow and tedious and mains only picking sockets from vaults
[0:44:13] nightst314: every 4 weeks you can target pick a maxed out item for your highest key in addition to regular loot.
[0:44:15] shareandcare: how do I give my double time warglaive to my random warlock alt though?
[0:44:20] nyshindysheen: why do you need a reason to log in other than you like to play the game? maybe i just like the game too much?
[0:44:21] wraghelm: 30 crests per timed key, 15 for a finished brick
[0:44:23] zysmos: i would gear my monk but i'm too lazy to grind now
[0:44:29] Boreall: What day is it
[0:44:36] Boreall: Nvm just saw steam title
[0:44:36] fuchai: i feel they just need to jump all in and do what FF does and make a single toon be able to be all classes
[0:44:38] fuchai: lol
[0:44:41] Joneim: @Boreall garf
[0:44:44] highcard2: @HeffaBear this is a good point, it feels like blizz tries a lot to prevent degen stuff but honestly just let us do it
[0:45:05] Lyhavoc: @Maximum  ive thought about this idea of what if we get an option to take multiple slots in the vault. Like if somone has both BiS trinkets in vault and have some sorta way to take both. Maybe like a merrit token sink or like an achievement or maybe even once a season
[0:45:06] variareturns: You could be able to switch to your alts loot spec and just have it auto-send, thatd be sick
[0:45:07] Vsplague: Seeds xD
[0:45:14] CMCam1: do we have an idea of when we might expect season 4?
[0:45:16] jacobtheultimate: @fuchai no this is actually kinda bad. gearing alts in FF is actually harder then wow cuz ur locked on weekly raid and tomes really hard
[0:45:32] highcard2: i just feel like theres way more value for their time on other things than trying to prevent a small portion of ppl from turbo gaming at the start of a season
[0:45:43] SachroTV: +3 with a no score buddy for bonus valor
[0:45:46] Vsplague: Nah no need
[0:45:46] nightst314: it's S4 who cares
[0:45:46] wraghelm: That would be insane
[0:45:47] roookai: why not shrujj
[0:45:48] Joneim: Should do
[0:45:48] Dzor12: I hope not
[0:45:48] SachroTV: that was beyond degen
[0:45:49] fuchai: true but that could be changed for the better
[0:45:51] MagnumCondomForMagnumDong: How much twitch chat lingo do you use in real life?
[0:45:53] MeisterChiefX: they should
[0:45:54] grummwasabi: un cap the fucking catalyst
[0:45:56] Ruinx81: +17 spam
[0:46:07] Jazzarus_: they can cause you need highewr keys for crests, not the same as valor
[0:46:11] love4juju: I love degen season 4. but ye, all degen all the time feels a bit much
[0:46:15] LucasSterling_: let degens be degens r
[0:46:17] Vsplague: Look at S2 it just wasn't needed tho
[0:46:40] fuchai: i think we just need cat girls as a playable race
[0:46:43] Tehblured: they dont need to uncap, just increase the amount you get as the season goes on
[0:46:44] tomato26: stop the cap
[0:46:48] ultideath: Either they find something fun for S4 or people unsub.
[0:46:51] wraghelm: I say "bricked" IRL all the time
[0:46:52] HeffaBear: you dont rip a thats pog
[0:46:53] santalylth: pog out
[0:46:54] Clarius: KEKW
[0:46:55] yifors: no way you don't say "turbo"
[0:46:57] SachroTV: "That would be pog bro"
[0:46:57] KaisenSiru: KEKW
[0:46:57] highcard2: that goal was poggers lmoa
[0:46:58] GrimmshadoXI: That sounds like you use it without realizing
[0:46:58] OG_Kawngi: yeah but how much gen z lingo is used
[0:46:58] Cakerinotv: I say pog sometimes
[0:46:59] Fray24_: "Poggies"
[0:47:01] Rugburn__: is natty twitch chat lingo?
[0:47:02] tomato26: Kappa dude is too cringe
[0:47:03] ShaggySummers: tell teh delivery guy that he's a real POGGER @Maximum
[0:47:03] nyshindysheen: "oh kappa"
[0:47:03] MagnumCondomForMagnumDong: youre in an adult hockey league? been thinking of doing that recently
[0:47:04] daevyfan: grey face no space
[0:47:05] askeyyy: it sucks ass gearing alts atm, trying to queue for low low keys is pain, would love to just get up to 480 a lot easier
[0:47:05] kakebuts: "That's wide poggies"
[0:47:06] santalylth: kekw
[0:47:06] gogka: thats a blatant lie Max
[0:47:08] Oracle_WoW: is "sus" twitch lingo?
[0:47:11] MakeMy_Day: you called your cook a warlord????
[0:47:12] wraghelm: Oh natty comes out all the time
[0:47:15] gogka: you would use 'Kappa Dude'
[0:47:15] KaisenSiru: PogChampion
[0:47:17] surpriseparty20: I only use Kappa with my friends who use discord and understand it LUL
[0:47:18] PaCozzz: you dont yell out poggers after scoring a goal?
[0:47:19] ThoseCrazyGuys: That goal was pogchamp dude
[0:47:24] Montiguy: MonkaS all the time
[0:47:32] santalylth: pog
[0:47:32] LucasSterling_: do u say DDDD
[0:47:40] PurpleKami: I like saying dedge
[0:47:45] CoffeeASAP: "How are you? I hope you are peepo happy today"
[0:47:49] AoPsyke: except if you're talking about the best show, Arcane. BatChest
[0:47:49] Linith_Heart: do you say Madge or Sadge though?
[0:47:49] fuchai: you can only talk in twitch chat style
[0:47:50] MagnumCondomForMagnumDong: I'
[0:47:50] nyshindysheen: i say pog all the time and people just look at me like ??? umm sure pog i guess lmao
[0:47:52] fuchai: whole time
[0:47:59] CMCam1: be nice to see them try out a M+ vendor in s4 buy it the same way you buy your sockets from shitty vaults
[0:47:59] ZeraFlameheart: rip a natty
[0:48:00] shareandcare: with guildies you probably also use bricked a lot
[0:48:02] LucasSterling_: swamp ass goes hard
[0:48:04] SachroTV: natty is not a twitch thing tho
[0:48:06] highcard2: for sure he says bubby b out in the wild
[0:48:08] fuchai: music sounds like 101 dalmations
[0:48:08] Joneim: Its neat
[0:48:10] MagnumCondomForMagnumDong: Id like to know more about any hockey league you're in and how that is structured
[0:48:10] Cakerinotv: yeah its been fun
[0:48:11] samaxis: Its fun
[0:48:14] BigTrout3: natty isn't twitch lingo. every meathead will know what natty means
[0:48:15] MagicMonte: No
[0:48:17] Boreall: I coped myself into thinking SoD was good at 25, and it's just more miserable now
[0:48:20] q_u_v_p: fun and chill
[0:48:20] raffedup: leveling sux
[0:48:20] JWallace: good change of pace
[0:48:21] jacobtheultimate: 40
[0:48:21] nyshindysheen: natty is a gym bro thing i tohught?
[0:48:22] ShaggySummers: How do you tell your girl you like her without using poggies? @Maximum
[0:48:22] samaxis: 40
[0:48:23] Razzlee: Yeah its fun
[0:48:23] ultideath: Max definitely says Deep Dick Dolly Dumpster irl
[0:48:23] PurpleKami: sod would be so much better without it being on classic
[0:48:23] DunzoCD: 40
[0:48:24] Mattwuzhere6: 40
[0:48:27] Byggareebob: they tune SoD more then retail KEKW
[0:48:27] Tyldorx: theyre nailing it excedpt class balance :)
[0:48:30] Mattwuzhere6: Im having a good time with it
[0:48:33] Joneim: yup
[0:48:43] Rynj96: they added a xp boost for below 25 which is nice
[0:48:44] fdb33: blackfathom deeps
[0:48:45] Boreall: The Devs are pretty clueless
[0:48:50] Surskim: bfd cooler than gnomer just lore/aesthetically imo
[0:48:53] surpriseparty20: U should just not take it seriously and enjoy the ride . That's my take
[0:48:58] Churchtrill: nope
[0:48:59] DunzoCD: not at all lol
[0:49:00] fdb33: thing about classic is it’s unbalanced, that’s kinda the point
[0:49:01] Taytor: OG classic was insanely unbalancedl mao
[0:49:02] StanRaenslen: they do a TON of tuning passes on SoD, of course release week is going to be unbalanced
[0:49:05] Aro725: right, but they made changes this time. So people want it to be now
[0:49:06] highcard2: werent half the specs like useless back then
[0:49:07] nightst314: The worst retail tuning post cata has been better than this
[0:49:08] jacobtheultimate: ye but they made it worse kinda
[0:49:09] Vsplague: ret xD
[0:49:10] Tyldorx: it wasn't, but you knew going into it what the balance was
[0:49:12] surpriseparty20: Bro classic balance is nonexistent.
[0:49:12] mattyydubzz: yep, even wrath classic was terribly unbalanced
[0:49:14] Emphi: This shit is way worse
[0:49:17] pratzil: Not at all balanced
[0:49:17] CoffeeASAP: No chanes! I was dogshit back then and I want to be dog shit now
[0:49:19] jacobtheultimate: PvP feels bad atleast
[0:49:21] fuchai: i hate leveling and thats mostly all it is so guess what? lol
[0:49:22] Joneim: Shaman tank is Goated
[0:49:25] Joneim: I want that in retail
[0:49:25] MeisterChiefX: the balance is way worse than vanilla
[0:49:29] chippy456: its gimmicky and fun
[0:49:31] CMCam1: @Maximum do you think an M+ vendor could work with vault currency in season 4?
[0:49:32] Rynj96: its nice because they added more tanks and healers so finding groups is easier
[0:49:34] Boreall: They took none of the feedback from the last phase, they didn't stick to their word on anything, they are emphasizing PvP while simultaneously stating they will not balance PvP. It's been depressing
[0:49:35] dmarinn: jesus people cry alot KEKW
[0:49:41] Surskim: its easy enough that balance doesnt matter but still pug mentality...
[0:49:45] MagnumCondomForMagnumDong: every class had their niche more than min/max balance in vanilla
[0:49:46] upmysleeeves: ron burgundy killin it on this flute solo
[0:49:48] Tyldorx: the balance now is REALLY bad tho, you cant say ''who cares'' when starsurge does 60% of someone's hp, costs 6 mana and is a 41 yard nuke instant cast 6sec cd
[0:50:02] Callka: the game is piss easy as it is, so it shouldn't matter what class/spec you play, but "elitists" will still demand you play bis
[0:50:04] sarrowzthewarlock: i hope i dont gotta farm class trinket again for S4
[0:50:08] sarrowzthewarlock: lol
[0:50:10] nightst314: what about refunds due to balancing changes? @Maximum
[0:50:36] Zolshy89: 2 or 3 weeks
[0:50:36] Aro725: You could only buy raid items with it in S4 wdym mythic plus?
[0:50:41] rukt: 3 weeks
[0:50:44] tomato26: we need a vault bad luck prevention system
[0:50:53] tomato26: not that shit socket we currently have
[0:51:01] Urinatingturtle: just get what you want wdym?
[0:51:02] LucasSterling_: what about the evoker and 2h legendary
[0:51:04] Neomagam: talk to the 2 warlocks in my raid group that are both 50+ runs deep in WM trying to get a branch
[0:51:12] d0mezg4mer: 3 weeks is the least blizz would ever do
[0:51:14] d0mezg4mer: prob 4
[0:51:16] Urinatingturtle: @Maximum just dont roll a bad vault?
[0:51:17] Himot: 2 vaults its ok to update an heroic m+ item to mythic level
[0:51:17] mino661: one mythic+ or raid item!
[0:51:18] nightst314: what about refunds though?
[0:51:36] zannuss: has to be later in the week or like 4 or 5 bricked weeks
[0:51:38] NotD4k: maybe tokens can also be redeemed for terts
[0:51:40] nightst314: 40-50
[0:51:41] JMaC727: target raid loot if you raid with a guild.  pugging is impossible
[0:51:41] koxytwitch: i did full m+ vault with 2 mythic raidslots on AVG the entire season, i have yet to see a 489 staff on the mage. its just shit
[0:51:45] Clevelandmk: bring back extra token on bosses
[0:51:46] CopeyJ: garf mondays
[0:51:55] cheezyyc: 2 bricked vaults for an item to upgrade say a hero track item to its myth track verson
[0:52:01] mino661: it is almost impossible to target mythic raid loot for 95% of people i will kill some raid bosses 2-3 times max
[0:52:10] Rynj96: @Maximum what do you think the biggest wow mistake blizzard has ever made? if you already answered this question someone tell me plz
[0:52:14] Clevelandmk: fgs changer the legendary loot system
[0:52:20] zannuss: I like that better, upgrading your existing item
[0:52:24] Tooyoo: or 1/10th of a dinar per week or something
[0:52:26] menzlo: Is the vault completely random
[0:52:26] Masterkdz: still no mythic Pip trinket after reclear every week :(
[0:52:28] Zolshy89: remember is s4 you had to kill, I forget if it was 10 mythic bosses or 30 mythic bosses. but there was an upgrade currency other than dinar
[0:52:29] SVT_Dexter: or it's at least an interesting choice
[0:52:29] Alfablade123: did blizzard said which are season 4 dungeons?
[0:52:37] Lenzoface: I've capped 5 mythic items in vault every single week on my warrior. Still not e single mythic (489) wep yet. And ofc no leggo
[0:52:43] Byggareebob: m+ers are already getting way to much loot and same ilvl as raiders at this point
[0:52:44] PurpleKami: I like to imagine your raid loot savant is just taking a big drag out of a cigarette from this cook
[0:52:49] Icycutes: people would brick week 1 for bis in week 2
[0:53:07] menzlo: Vault should use deck system
[0:53:22] nyshindysheen: i ran all +17 week one.. i bricked it hard doing that
[0:53:36] Stimulated01: ain't no way they are bricking thier vaults that close to the brgining
[0:53:36] Mazmerized: most people don't have hero track bis trinkets grinded from keys week 1 anyway
[0:53:38] kremeister: you arent passing 2 myth track items first 2 weeks of a season for 1 bis item, no shot
[0:53:46] koxytwitch: thats just not true
[0:53:52] Ravannoth: Isnt a socket more value than 6 ilvl in most cases ?
[0:54:05] Standy94: I can only get upgrades 1 a week since I don’t do mythic raid
[0:54:10] fdb33: people forgetting that u have capped crests early season
[0:54:14] Vsplague: it was
[0:54:17] CoffeeASAP: that would be my joker moment lol
[0:54:24] CoffeeASAP: oh that's not the same
[0:54:43] wraghelm: Sim it
[0:54:45] wraghelm: for content
[0:54:51] Rugburn__: or weapon
[0:55:09] LucasSterling_: but you probably wouldnt even have that many things to socket first or 2nd week
[0:55:10] Elseworldz: Season 4 is the time to try this stuff
[0:55:14] fdb33: I know for my enh, the only trinket 6ilvl upgrade that would be more than a socket is signet brand
[0:55:24] CMCam1: they should make the M+ vendor rotate every 4 weeks like corruption classic
[0:55:27] DiddyDemon: Can this token not just come from maxing a row in the vault. Don't require a brick?
[0:56:30] Vitel__: Are they doing all dragon flight dungeons for season 4?
[0:56:31] dhezghia: what about buying avoidance or leech with the currency @maximum
[0:56:43] zannuss: I think whatever it could be should be mid season
[0:56:52] Vitel__: I hate opening my vault and seeing 4 fucking capes
[0:56:57] grummwasabi: @Maximum what about having vault rewards be based off the pool of dungeons you actually run vs them all as a whole?
[0:57:05] Nitz_exe: wow a whole week for +50 leech!
[0:57:06] ShabsieAU: i would only buy indestructible
[0:57:09] menzlo: Game needs more interesting stats / gearing
[0:57:11] Patrush1: true
[0:57:21] Flazzard_x: @Maximum man i miss u, when r u going to invite me to the guild
[0:57:25] nightst314: 30 fyrakk kills,  no axe
[0:57:28] Vitel__: I still haven't gotten a single double time on my rogue btw, like 10+ weeks in
[0:57:29] zannuss: Thats where my main is at, it logs in does one m+ and heroic fyrakk for no axe and thats it, only upgrades are from the vault
[0:57:35] Urinatingturtle: true
[0:57:36] Baskkov: they need more rewards from m+ rather than io, even comsmetic
[0:57:36] mort459: so you can buy tertiary the same way you can buy sockets?
[0:57:41] vodkasam777: plus your not gonna spend it because you could high roll your item week 3 / 4 / 5
[0:57:41] Regroot_Gaming: i liked the infinite power increase like legion ap farm and bfa ap farm
[0:57:43] Camelbak21: You can buy sockets with vault tokens, why can't you buy tertiaries too? I makes no sense
[0:57:43] kremeister: @Maximum seperate currency for doing +20s or higher that let you upgrade hero track gear into mythic track but only from dungeons? or just take said currency to vendor for myth track dungeon loot.
[0:57:44] mrduckytom: make it a gacha and give people currency to reroll their items :p
[0:57:46] Euphoria_wow: sockets/tertiary stats should be purchasable with the x6 tokens from vault
[0:57:47] mandbyvgc: never getting the lego is fun
[0:57:49] wraghelm: Totally agree
[0:57:51] nellfin: fun hoping for the same shit i'm wearing every week but in a higher ilvl
[0:57:51] Shapingus: that's when the game is more fun for me tbh, that means i have everything i need to blast content
[0:57:55] Patrush1: tbh the treadmill gameplay loop of getting gear is over pretty quickly @Maximum thoughts?
[0:58:06] Faraday5001: its good that you can "finish" a character tho
[0:58:07] Shapingus: not having to do your vault at a point isn't a problem imo
[0:58:11] dhezghia: more avoidance would feel good
[0:58:14] CoffeeASAP: I'm using this time to learn specs I havent played before. Currently terrorizing pugs with an arcane mage lol
[0:58:17] DiddyDemon: Just have a token that allows a hero piece to be converted up to myth, still requires the farm for the item. Then final step the same token will apply a random tertiary stat
[0:58:26] StreamElements: Subscribe to HelloFresh and use my code POGHF121355 to receive one free breakfast item per box while subscription is active https://strms.net/hellofresh_maximum #ad
[0:58:27] Klutch81: Insteead of tokens get like materials towards building specific items
[0:58:40] TattersAU: Then its just MNS and chill
[0:58:44] Icycutes: what if vault just dropped trinket and weapon tokens instead of specific ones?
[0:58:44] Euphoria_wow: having capped aspect crests with no way to use them 485+ i lvl so no use for crafted, and cant send them to other alts is unreal.
[0:58:59] sarrowzthewarlock: i havent touched mythic at all M+ got my mythic items lol
[0:59:09] Regroot_Gaming: wouldn't it be better if we get infinite upgrades , more fun i mean , like why cant we infinitely grind crests/ upgrading track items from 1/6 to 1/infinite , sounds fun lol more things to do in the game
[0:59:16] Vitel__: They should introduce prestige for IO and gear like in call of duty
[0:59:24] GrimmshadoXI: @Shapingus Of course.. once you're in all bis. Chasing ALL season long feels bad
[0:59:33] danaxvx: Are RWF raiders required to full clear and fill their vault every week on all their alts?
[0:59:39] StanRaenslen: theres no middle ground with wow players, there's only "required things to do" and "useless things to do"
[0:59:40] Lokajin: M+'ers cap out pretty quick on gear
[0:59:41] nellfin: vault feels more important later imo, it's the only place i can find upgrades
[0:59:45] LucasSterling_: vault is a slot machine which gives me dopamine so i will still do a weekly
[1:00:07] mrduckytom: but if sockets would be warbound wouldn't that also help with altgearing and keep the vault somewhat relevant?
[1:00:11] menzlo: 24s
[1:00:11] Touchpadwarrior: as someone that doesn't mythic prog or push high M+, I got to 487 then stopped caring about my gear
[1:00:15] BLACKFOOT_TN: I don't want multiple months fishing for a trinket or weapon. I want to get my gear. Do the weekly raid and some keys with the boys. Then have time outside of wow to play other games or touch grass. Making me farm for weeks and months for something that I should be able to target just never feels good.
[1:00:23] Vitel__: EZ
[1:00:29] Shapingus: @GrimmshadoXI which is my point against adding tertiaries as vault token rewards or w/e. bc then you're not *really* complete for even longer
[1:00:32] larkhill: ive always wanted to be the 1%
[1:00:33] Camelbak21: You with 5% avoid cause you never got any from the vault vs the rngjesus guy with 20% avoid, yea gl being on the same playfield
[1:00:35] menzlo: It's it's 24s
[1:00:36] love4juju: it’s 24s now I think
[1:00:37] turtleulty: 20s is all i need
[1:00:39] BigTrout3: holy shit that feels achievable
[1:00:41] MagicMonte: Because most people stop at 20, they don't care about score.
[1:00:43] froggeraj: froggeraj subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 17 months, currently on a 2 month streak! YOOOOOOOOOO
[1:00:56] Baskkov: top 1% is 3.35 rating right now
[1:00:56] Urinatingturtle: 20s is all i need tbh
[1:00:58] Dzor12: Are those %s dragged down by having multiple alts that only do +11s and stuff? @Maximum
[1:00:58] ThisIzD: Hey Max, as a long-time viewer of your streams and professional THD modder in chat, I would really appreciate it if you would go back to Cowboy emoji titles over telling us what day it is. We are not your personal calendar. We deserve better.
[1:01:00] m_dep: I'm a stream viewer degenerate and I never even get to that
[1:01:02] Eziak: Isn't it just .1% of the people who are DOING keys?
[1:01:04] DaBearGaming: Is that using individual accounts or characters?
[1:01:04] ZordiakZero: What is the reason to do keys higher than 20s? Just for fun?
[1:01:10] Vitel__: There is nothing more demotivating than seeing dogshit in the vault every week
[1:01:11] Eziak: That calculation doesn't take people who don't do m+
[1:01:11] BigTrout3: I'm gonna be a 1% tank jpcJuiced
[1:01:19] m_dep: solo queue when
[1:01:26] Lorrdzik: @ZordiakZero yes
[1:01:36] dithrica: @ZordiakZero fun. challenge, the dopamine hit from seeing your io go up by 3 lol
[1:01:43] DunzoCD: i liked the positive affix cook from DRATTY
[1:01:45] DaBearGaming: @ZordiakZero funny number goes up
[1:01:46] BLACKFOOT_TN: @MagicMonte Blizzard doesn't give people a reason to do past 20's. In fact most people just knock out weekly 18s and skip 20's altogether.
[1:02:02] Klutch81: the shift from gear stopping at +15 to 20 was a great move
[1:02:09] Ruinx81: This season has felt good though, people in my guild who woudln't normally go above 17 have been doing 20s
[1:02:11] ZordiakZero: @dithrica I may not get it, but fair enough
[1:02:23] OlaF_oo: is there a reason to not have more rewards?
[1:02:36] yifors: blizzard balanced the game at 20s, it's the players that expect it to be balanced at 30s, which is ridicoulous
[1:02:40] oneshotelitee: Give us a m+ version of the glad mount for high io
[1:02:48] dithrica: @ZordiakZero I didn't either. decided to push this season. Have enjoyed WoW more than at any point in the last 16 years.
[1:02:59] Vitel__: m+ gear is hella easier to obtain compared to raid gear for the same upgrade track/ilvl
[1:03:09] wraghelm: I wish there were rewards for 3k, 3500, etc
[1:03:11] Lorrdzik: that is me I would do more if I had a team to push but I wont pug above 20+
[1:03:14] BigTrout3: give ksm illusions for weapons, like with pvp
[1:03:18] TTVNumerals: @Maximum Will there be a RWF for the fated season coming up?
[1:03:19] Tigerklaue: i get the portals every season and stop
[1:03:23] TattersAU: Above 18 at this point
[1:03:25] domz_i: Portals are weak too, it shouldn't require a completed dungeon to reset.
[1:03:28] surpriseparty20: I mean realistically why waste more resources for something that is about the 1% ? No matter the mount/mog they put I don't think people will want to push
[1:03:33] booznoon: should def be a reward for 3k io
[1:03:34] merzicdh: there should be some reward for hitting 3k rating
[1:03:42] domz_i: If you fail a higher key, then your portal is on a 8 hours cd
[1:03:45] nyshindysheen: special gear set at 3.5k io?
[1:03:46] Vitel__: I do my 8 20's then I'm done m+, literally no point unless I get better gear
[1:03:46] TattersAU: Full 25's should have pvp equivalent rewards
[1:03:46] Baskkov: title is very hard without premade
[1:03:57] Ruinx81: reward for 3k?
[1:04:14] TehWongWay: wheres my high IO mount
[1:04:18] kadashy1: for sure it's hard to stay motivated pushing from 3200+
[1:04:19] Lenzoface: 38,5% of EU playerbase has Keystone Master - which is really high for a mounnt achiev. Mount should be like atleast 3-3,5k rio and make it somewhat a target and special @Maximum
[1:04:19] Im_Mathiosky: what about a dinar-type system for heroic dungeon gear if you do keys +21 or upper, instead of the current percentage to get random extra loot at the end of the dungeon?
[1:04:20] Roccocco: big yes
[1:04:20] ZordiakZero: Just give more tittles or transmogs for doing higher than 20 keys
[1:04:28] Regroot_Gaming: so 20s reward heroic track items , why not adding mythic track items to 25s + cause not everyone can do them
[1:04:29] Jjmn12: even just an elite tmog recolor would get more people to do it
[1:04:30] BreezyWinter: i think it would be cool to have myth track gear starting at like... 22 or 24 or something
[1:04:31] domz_i: Elite transmog like pvp?
[1:04:31] Reznr: The 2500 reward was a good addition
[1:04:34] Himot: Thats why i did 21-22 for bonus loot then only 20s for vault
[1:04:35] oneshotelitee: Imo they should give a m+ version  of the glad mount when you reach a certain io
[1:04:36] domz_i: Weapon illusions
[1:04:43] nellfin: they tried that in DF by moving the gear cap to 20 keys no?
[1:04:44] goodmonsin: yeah for sure I would like a progression thing like a cooler mount or something
[1:04:49] goodmonsin: like pvp mounts are so rad
[1:04:51] wraghelm: Yeah, mounts, mog, etc are always a good reward. Like my first season of 2500 I was psyched for the mog item
[1:04:59] leland_saxifrage: Man, I miss challenge mode appearances
[1:05:03] theskot: 480 felt free on M+ only
[1:05:10] love4juju: if your doing the 25+ range but not title range are all the really good players that are not playing the meta spec.
[1:05:11] splashz0r: the only reason i even play alts is to m+
[1:05:13] wraghelm: Thats KSH
[1:05:14] goodmonsin: ksm 2k
[1:05:15] jacobtheultimate: thats ksh
[1:05:15] Mecabeast: 2000 is ksm
[1:05:15] kelly_mac06: KSM is 2k
[1:05:16] Korupcija_: if anything, mythic raiding is not rewarding at all
[1:05:16] Regroot_Gaming: ksm 2k ,
[1:05:17] Moodann36: KSH
[1:05:18] booznoon: keystone hero is 2.5
[1:05:19] kelly_mac06: KSH is 2.5
[1:05:20] goodmonsin: 2500 is shoulder mog
[1:05:23] Crucaider: 2k = KSM, 2.5 is KSH
[1:05:24] jacobtheultimate: keystone hero
[1:05:28] wraghelm: Tier at 2k
[1:05:28] unName96: token is ksm too
[1:05:28] Lenzoface: 2k is piece and mount
[1:05:28] kelly_mac06: no KSM you get tier
[1:05:30] Reznr: 2500 is the appearance thing
[1:05:30] Regroot_Gaming: 2k ksm and tier
[1:05:30] Urinatingturtle: 2k is tier
[1:05:30] Remedivh: KSM is tier, KSH is shoulder/helm mog
[1:05:31] rhino_u: yeah mog
[1:05:33] Mecabeast: 2500 gets you the shoulder effect
[1:05:33] Urinatingturtle: 2.5k is the mog
[1:05:33] StickyTreez: 2k was tier piece
[1:05:33] kelly_mac06: KSH you get mog
[1:05:33] unName96: 2.5 k is mog
[1:05:34] Regroot_Gaming: 2.5k mog
[1:05:36] Consor: 2500 is KSH gets you fancier tier mog
[1:05:38] Ruinx81: shoulder mog you can't even see on some peices :D
[1:05:38] Azkrust: 2500 yes
[1:05:40] Ghost_of_fate: 2.5k is the mog change
[1:05:41] khrun_cf7: @Maximum cosmetics- actual unique or different tmogs for weapons or new sets instead of 100th recolor- glad like mount for 0.1 title that would change so much
[1:05:48] Vitel__: Bit off-topic, but wow the KSM mounts this year were such a letdown. Should have been dragon riding mounts
[1:06:00] oneshotelitee: You get that on 2k
[1:06:02] wraghelm: "Keystone Blaster" for 3k. "Keystone Railer" for 3500
[1:06:03] grobb12: doing all 25s should give you something
[1:06:19] Lenzoface: high score is life
[1:06:21] Ruinx81: "Keystone Pumper"
[1:06:22] theskot: challenge itself can be fun but yeah lol
[1:06:27] ZordiakZero: I timed almost all the 20 keys and then pretty much stopped playing
[1:06:28] theskot: need to give players stuff
[1:06:31] surpriseparty20: Keystone bricker for 3k LUL
[1:06:32] love4juju: a top 1% mount/title or appearance would be nice
[1:06:38] d0mezg4mer: I stop at 20s every season but would love a reason to push higher thats reasonable (I aint trying to pug title)
[1:06:42] BLACKFOOT_TN: Transmogs and mounts are the biggest drivers for people wanting to do something.
[1:06:46] oneshotelitee: It's free to gear but  if you like to push keys your just doing that to kill time
[1:06:46] Mecabeast: most people doing m+ are only doing it for vault
[1:06:47] Vitel__: I don't do something unless there's incentive, 'fun' isn't good enough >:(
[1:06:50] poroyou: I got 3k this season and said.. eh ive seen it
[1:06:58] Byggareebob: atleast 30-50% of the people who do m+ are only doing it for the gear tho
[1:07:01] wraghelm: Its weird that the highest achievement in M+ is a title
[1:07:10] Urinatingturtle: i think they need to give me all my best gear for absolutely no reason just because @Maximum
[1:07:12] Lenzoface: Mount should be top 1%, or even 0,1% like Gladiator
[1:07:15] zannuss: Yeah I see no reason to do over 20s personally, sometimes I get roped into a 21 or 22, but I'll never get seasonal title so for me it has no value
[1:07:18] The9thChevron: Brawler's guild too
[1:07:21] BigTrout3: I would suck so many cocks for matter tower appearances again
[1:07:35] kellarXO: @BigTrout3 huh
[1:07:36] Vitel__: @BigTrout3 I'm ready
[1:07:38] flabstv: @BigTrout3 huh
[1:07:38] stelfbronco: @maximum is it worth to run normal raids just to learn the fights better and pars but I already have AOTC so is it a waste of my time
[1:07:45] arigold___: all these %s are character based however not account based so its surely not 99% vs 1%
[1:07:54] oneshotelitee: Mage tower was the best way to learn your class back in legion
[1:08:01] surpriseparty20: I did mage tower on my bear in S1 in like 10 tries. Didn't feel hard . ( Compared to what I remember from legion)
[1:08:01] Kalanil: i thought the reward to push +20 is the challenge and competitiveness, but that just me i guess
[1:08:14] Niv1era: @Lenzoface 0,1% and a gladiator title is a different world) gladiator +-3% i'd assume
[1:08:24] Vitel__: @Kalanil nah I need something tangible
[1:08:25] TattersAU: @surpriseparty20 It got a lot easier with talent trees, compared to what they released in SL
[1:08:31] Kanklz: Kanklz subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 27 months! 
[1:08:34] TheBroCrow: GIGACHAIR
[1:08:39] Kerandes: @Niv1era rank 1 title is a different scenario though
[1:08:53] ShabsieAU: i just enjoy hitting my buttons and doing big dam which is why i do high keys
[1:08:53] Niv1era: @Niv1era sure
[1:08:54] oneshotelitee: I get + 20 on all my alts when they are like 460 ilvl it's to easy for anything under a 25
[1:08:57] stelfbronco: @maximum is it worth to run normal raids just to learn the fights better and pars but I already have AOTC so is it a waste of my time
[1:09:03] elcoobrahh: Yo Max, watch roox's vid of  noob player plays wow for the first time. You will die out of laughter
[1:09:15] oneshotelitee: But pug groups are good at making these things hard for us lol
[1:09:19] Eltiima: at least mount should fly
[1:09:24] Korupcija_: 50 wins above 2.4
[1:09:41] surpriseparty20: Why is everyone eating Chipotle btw is it that good ? ( EU Andy we don't have that shit here)
[1:09:44] Eziak: Glad has been fucked this expansion
[1:09:44] Crucaider: Much easier
[1:09:45] Mecabeast: 2100?
[1:09:47] Eziak: It's so fucking hard to get glad
[1:09:47] mithik29: 2400
[1:09:50] Nekz3: 2400
[1:09:50] iiamBaro: 2400 50wins
[1:09:50] Iridiumspx: this pvp season is so deflated
[1:09:52] Crucaider: 2.1k
[1:09:54] Cenochi: Hello friends
[1:09:56] genovis1: glad mount is 50 wins over 2.4 rating
[1:09:59] merzicdh: There should be KSM=viscous and 3k+ should be like glad
[1:10:02] goranves: put in 2k games and didnt get glad first season m+ got 3k
[1:10:05] i_wish_southbadboy: i mean pvp also has a participation reward mount, so pve should add a mount at a higher difficulty
[1:10:05] Lawso42: KSM is like +13s now. it's piss
[1:10:05] Pyrrha_GG: also KSM mount is beans compared to glad mount
[1:10:10] grummwasabi: yup
[1:10:12] fdb33: u can lose rating in PvP though where’s Rio u can’t
[1:10:12] Lenzoface: 38,5% of EU has keystone master - which basicly means anyone who bothers doiung every key at +15 gets the mount for free
[1:10:25] ColdIceCreamMan: boosters and professionals. it's so dumb
[1:10:27] mithik29: normal Gladiator is easy but not at these time with mmr pblms feels pretty tough to get
[1:10:29] oneshotelitee: But for pve they could always just give you a goal for example 3.5 is the equivalent of glad then you get a mount and then if you get0.1 you get a special mount
[1:10:29] SCMSV: @surpriseparty20 Uhh aside from the recent EVO sponsorship bit, its generally alright food
[1:10:33] NykolasRage: It will always be like that too cause WoW PvP doesn't grow.
[1:10:40] nellfin: from what i've seen from high pvp'ers it's just the same 15 people rotating in arena
[1:10:43] Vitel__: As a runescape player, fuck pvp
[1:10:49] fdb33: like for M+ if u spend enough time u can get where u want to go, not the same for pvp
[1:10:53] Touchpadwarrior: 1,000+ mounts and not a single glad mount peepoSad highest I've been was 2100
[1:10:55] xxpurplehazen: garf monday
[1:11:01] Eziak: Is that 38.5% of all EU players, or just EU players that have timed a key?
[1:11:01] stelfbronco: @maximum is it worth to run normal raids just to learn the fights better and pars but I already have AOTC so is it a waste of my time
[1:11:03] surpriseparty20: @scmsv  yeh I was wondering why I see every one eat that shit doodLUL
[1:11:05] Xibate: imagine losing rio for failing to time your key
[1:11:07] BLACKFOOT_TN: Whats the KSM difference % between EU and NA?
[1:11:11] Eziak: All of ***'s data is only on characters who have done keys, right?
[1:11:16] ColdIceCreamMan: yea you can do KSM just by investing time
[1:11:22] Dzor12: @BLACKFOOT_TN KSM isn't %, it's reaching a flat score
[1:11:22] fallenstargh: I forget , is ksm 2k rating?
[1:11:26] yifors: that'd be so toxic
[1:11:27] Lenzoface: Would make the mount more special if it required like 3,5k RIO
[1:11:27] Mazmerized: AINTNOWAY
[1:11:33] dithrica: as someone who has to pug all their keys, yeah that sounds awful lol
[1:11:35] Vitel__: literally you just have to show up to a bunch of +16s at the ass end of a season and you'll get KSM in a day
[1:11:37] Ghost_of_fate: That would be horrible, keys would be SO toxic!
[1:11:39] Onyo1337: keys are toxic enough already AINTNOWAY
[1:11:40] BLACKFOOT_TN: Bro that would be the MOST toxic shit ever.
[1:11:42] DuckHS: Could be io rating loss if someone rage quits during
[1:11:43] merzicdh: that would be terrible. azerlon/rag players be leaving even more
[1:11:49] surpriseparty20: I'd prefer to lose IO than brick the key LUL
[1:11:52] kelly_mac06: @Vitel__ yup, is a joke
[1:11:55] Eziak: I would never touch M+ in that case, I have ladder anxiety
[1:11:59] BigTrout3: I think an elo system would be very hard to implement in keys
[1:12:01] genovis1: that just leads to toxicity though
[1:12:01] barbiegirlxxo: what rating is keystone master
[1:12:03] mithik29: or wait , A solo shuffle with a random key and random ppl to complete it :D
[1:12:05] i_wish_southbadboy: Well you still lose a key level though, you have to spend time again to bring it up, and you cant even choose the dungeon lmao
[1:12:07] oneshotelitee: Lol not in a pug group that won't fly
[1:12:07] koxytwitch: @Maximum leaving an inprogress key should put ppl in loser prio, making them only able to do their own keys
[1:12:07] RoloDB: people would hold ur rating hostage for sure
[1:12:08] booznoon: the more coveted rewards they add for high score the more people rmt though right
[1:12:09] The_Mail_Man__: gm
[1:12:14] kelly_mac06: @barbiegirlxxo 2k
[1:12:16] yifors: why is breaking a key a thing tho
[1:12:19] Vitel__: You should lose for prematurely leaving keys
[1:12:26] surpriseparty20: I have played too much League to care about losing LP LUL
[1:12:27] shale93: just spam BRH abd farn scire
[1:12:36] shale93: and farm score*
[1:12:39] othernewname: This would make nonmeta specs unplayable
[1:12:48] Crucaider: You'd have to push, elo style like the way PVP is done
[1:12:49] Basic_3: @yifors The alternative world is a pretty bad TR "spam the first pull" experience.
[1:12:52] BLACKFOOT_TN: Bricking a key is just a great way to punish you for pugging.
[1:12:54] sohjesussalva: i'm tryna pug 22's but i keep getting into groups where a guy is trying to carry a friend with 450 ilvl, so annoying
[1:12:59] wayslay: ksm is beyond easy to get now.
[1:13:03] oneshotelitee: @vitel__  yea I agree but if the key is not timeable you don't get punished for leaving
[1:13:04] The_Mail_Man__: AP Pog
[1:13:07] Ukillay: Reforging
[1:13:09] BigTrout3: systems Madge
[1:13:14] nightst314: completion rates below keylvl14 are nearly 98-99% already
[1:13:14] ShaggySummers: Glyphs
[1:13:16] sarrowzthewarlock: i think corruption is gonna be there
[1:13:16] chimneybob: Class halls please
[1:13:17] dolgare: Corruption and reforging
[1:13:18] RememberLeon: Nah it is a massive issue that every week if you don't time a specific key it basically just gets harder. People almost never go back to a throne 26 if they have timed it so you are stuck with people who can't time it at this point.
[1:13:20] FrilleJr: Systems???? Madge
[1:13:20] Mecabeast: you would also need timed keys to not give points at all because  pvp that happens where wins dont give points

[1:15:20] ZordiakZero: As someone who skipped almost all of BFA, I was very confused at corruption gear when I came back in the last month.
[1:15:26] AgrM_Gengar: playing with corruption was god, getting corruption was awful
[1:15:26] crolo0: actualy asmon liked coruption
[1:15:27] oneshotelitee: Yea corruption was horrible
[1:15:31] AgrM_Gengar: good*

[1:23:03] flabstv: mission tables should never exist
[1:23:04] OrganicJKW: They're still in the game though, so I don't think it'd be on the list.
[1:23:04] bmarksy: i wanna build a house
[1:23:07] Grissu_: Building garrison was fun, but the rest meh

[1:23:59] ZordiakZero: I used the SL one, it was kinda weird
[1:24:00] Taytor: I mean. I had like 8 alts that did it and farmed runes in SL with it.
[1:24:01] AgrM_Gengar: the SL one was useless
[1:24:01] trickyshot_: Once i got the mounts i stopped

[1:25:12] yifors: it was the new thing back then
[1:25:14] nalegi07: having separate pve and pvp stats doesn’t jive with modern wow. it would completely fragment the game
[1:25:14] sethron: the pandaria farm

[1:26:29] zenkodac: i like that idea, but i know 10 man raiding woould never reach what 20 man can be
[1:26:29] Vitel__: 40 man mythic
[1:26:33] antipheonixna: i mean but we still haven't achieved build variety yet, most trees ppl get what they want
[1:26:35] stelfbronco: NO MYTHIC LOCKOUT
[1:26:35] Kooznik: id whip my dick out if that happened
[1:26:36] berchberkins: 10 man heroic would be my ideal situation
[1:26:38] nickelvc: makes heroic/mythic content much more accessible
[1:26:38] Himot: 10m War Within PLSSSSSS
[1:26:41] Zxczack: huge nerf for roster boss
[1:26:41] Joneim: Imagine Chris metzen on the blizzcon frontline announcing 10 man
[1:26:42] PrimeTimeRime: the old 3 column talent system
[1:26:44] m_dep: @Maximum too many specs, i think blizz has painted themselves into a corner here
[1:26:46] nickelvc: also it's hard to get into normals as a tank, always full
[1:26:50] surpriseparty20: Maybe legendary acquisition like shadowmourne valanyr etc ?
[1:26:51] BLACKFOOT_TN: Kill 20 man mythic. And just make everything 10 man mythic.
[1:26:51] Steehll: Class Order Halls
[1:27:00] super_fofa: m+ is the evolution of challenge mode
[1:27:00] nrozz: @MeisterChiefX Definitely not way easier in all cases. Heroic Garrosh was much more difficult 10 man than 25 for example. And...Neltharion where you had the pillars with adds that needed to be interupted.
[1:27:01] HeffaBear: @nightst314 wasnt a problem in bfa, idk
[1:27:07] nalegi07: proving grounds?
[1:27:08] Standy94: WoW is weird now because there’s no server communities
[1:27:09] antipheonixna: just make a 10 man raid in .5 or .7 patches
[1:27:11] ZordiakZero: Scenarios?
[1:27:11] ClipCraft: proving grounds
[1:27:13] swagggle: Brawlers Guild was so fun
[1:27:15] hexarover: cmode owned at the time
[1:27:15] JohnnyMcCrit: Why ist Mythic Flex a Problem? @maximum
[1:27:20] zannuss: Not kinda, it is
[1:27:20] DunzoCD: farms from MoP/Garrisons maybe
[1:27:20] BigTheTank: bold prediction: First Aid profession
[1:27:28] stelfbronco: more than 3 raids per patch
[1:27:29] Divinuss_: island expeditions xdd
[1:27:32] Lenzoface: Bring the reward/loot system of challenge modes to M+ @Maximum
[1:27:35] nightst314: @HeffaBear because it was nerfed already
[1:27:39] Recemate: brawlers guild imo
[1:27:46] hi_im_sant: seasonal affix xdding
[1:27:52] HeffaBear: @nightst314 no it wasnt lol
[1:27:56] Boreall: @Maximum I've been playing Classic for 4 years, and I mean no hate by saying this, but that playerbase is not getting better
[1:27:57] stelfbronco: more than 3 raids per patch.
[1:28:07] ShortBusLock: i was soloing 1 of the challenge modes and carrying 4 people for gold
[1:28:08] mcphatty: @antipheonixna dude, raids like ZG in classic, where there are tons of side grades but not a ton of power progression, and make them 10man
[1:28:09] surpriseparty20: The way u acquired old Legos like shadowmourne and valanyr might be in there @maximum
[1:28:15] ColdIceCreamMan: yea it's the tmog
[1:28:18] perhaps_ink: challenge mode its just mdi leaderboard
[1:28:18] Standy94: Challenge mode rewards were way better than M+
[1:28:19] domz_i: People just want their cloudsong glaive lol
[1:28:19] zenkodac: i mean not that many people were doing that, the amount of people that got boosted thru challange modes rather then doing it is probably huge
[1:28:21] Tehblured: Brawlers Guild
[1:28:22] ColdIceCreamMan: order halls
[1:28:22] AoPsyke: kind of like pro player mechanics in LoL 10 years ago are expected from the lowest rank players nowadays

[1:28:27] snipespb: im curious if people want older stats back like multistrike/armor pen/hit etc and spell resists
[1:28:28] Kestrell11: brawlers guild!
[1:28:35] nightst314: @HeffaBear I'm the player with the most legacy raid boss kills on a single characters, clearing certain raids for more than 12 years on a weekly basis. If 1 person in the world knows what changed and when it is me.
[1:28:35] stelfbronco: more than 3 raids per patch
[1:28:40] Joneim: The old way sucked bad
[1:28:40] upmysleeeves: just got back, but maybe artifacts

[1:28:45] Steehll: Reforging
[1:28:46] mantooth11: reputation tabards from BC
[1:28:48] hexarover: i liked legion legendaries, should have iterated on that more imo
[1:28:54] fdb33: just cuz getting fyralath sucks doesn’t make Smourne not suck hahaha
[1:28:56] KaisenSiru: TRUE
[1:28:56] Benjg7: def don’t have it be one per guild you contribute to
[1:28:58] zysmos: people would be furious
[1:29:00] Standy94: I hope he puts covenants omega lul
[1:29:03] yifors: idgaf about somebody elses leggo lul
[1:29:06] Adrang: are we putting what WE think we want back or guessing what they are going to put on the list?
[1:29:06] stelfbronco: more than 3 raids per patch.
[1:29:08] Joneim: Horrific visions?? (but better)
[1:29:10] Korupcija_: mop farm
[1:29:12] zenkodac: i want neither, i want it like this but just make it way more likely or dont tune the classes that get a lego around it
[1:29:13] CMCam1: class quests maybe?
[1:29:14] fdb33: in retails version of the game getting Smourne would be awful, though I do enjoy it in wotlk classic
[1:29:15] larkhill: did people like the proving grounds? that might be fun
[1:29:15] The9thChevron: What about the MoP/WoD legendaries you built the whole xpac?
[1:29:16] m_dep: legendaries are meaningless because they normalize spec tuning anyway, so it ends up just being an extra hoop to have the same power
[1:29:19] ryan5122: hiru is a goated wow content creator
[1:29:22] lolwhateverdog: i know ppl with like 10+ H fyrakk and no legendary lol it is pretty not great tbh
[1:29:22] AnabolicFreaks: the raiders cared about the lore back then tho, then dont really now
[1:29:24] Himot: I didnt drop mine yet peepoSad
[1:29:28] Psyquest: I want 10 man mythic back
[1:29:37] verzin_: why not the progressive legendary system for the whole expac? like mop & wod??? that was dope.
[1:29:39] Kooznik: Scenarios?
[1:29:42] Clarius: cosmetic glyphs
[1:29:43] ZordiakZero: Scenarios is the only other one I can think of, as a guess.
[1:29:44] stelfbronco: more than 3 raids per patch
[1:29:44] Gamerhcp: reforging
[1:29:47] grobb12: corruptions
[1:29:47] jackpepsimba: Buff Starsurge!
[1:29:49] Recemate: brawlers guild
[1:29:49] ShaggySummers: how cold is your food by now? @Maximum
[1:29:50] jackpepsimba: Buff it!
[1:29:50] Joneim: xdd
[1:29:50] JERAULT: island expeditions ALOO
[1:29:51] KaisenSiru: Warfronts Pog
[1:29:51] DunzoCD: if they did islands differently they coulda been fun
[1:29:52] sunsourse: @Joneim Big true, horrific visions is probably there
[1:29:53] Steehll: Torghast
[1:29:53] Lorrdzik: KEKW
[1:29:54] guynormally: he's gonna have legion legendaries, ashbringer is in the thumbnail
[1:29:54] Earthtusks: KEKW
[1:29:58] larkhill: island expeditions
[1:30:00] opticon82: weapon skills ;)
[1:30:01] KaisenSiru: BRAWLERS Guild yes!
[1:30:01] yifors: withered scenario
[1:30:02] Azoy_: Dinars
[1:30:02] Rhemax18: What about Torghast?
[1:30:02] zenkodac: scenarios are probably there
[1:30:02] drazzil7: Wither training!
[1:30:03] Orange_SM: torghast but just for fun not for power
[1:30:03] levidor1: BRAWLERS GUILD @Maximum
[1:30:03] CMCam1: warfronts and island expeditions Pog
[1:30:04] Cybrra: Horrific visions from bfa
[1:30:04] Kerandes: @Maximum unpopular opinion - pvp gear that matters in pve (shadowlands season 1 for example)
[1:30:06] Kooznik: @Maximum Scenarios? Feel like they would be pretty sweet if they updated them
[1:30:06] Lenzoface: Mage Tower @Maximum
[1:30:07] BbreakGaming: can we get our old cities back? YEP
[1:30:10] Mecabeast: torgast
[1:30:11] Phycerog: visions
[1:30:14] BLACKFOOT_TN: People from BACK THEN forget about the rage that caused. And people FROM NOW never experienced being forced to raid just to feed items to the Leggo princess in the guild. And you got a bag of dicks in return. That's what old leggo farming was like.
[1:30:19] levidor1: BRAWLERS GUILD. @Maximum
[1:30:22] Standy94: Covenants!
[1:30:23] stelfbronco: more than 3 raids per patch.
[1:30:24] ShaggySummers: Was proving grounds a system? @Maximum
[1:30:26] cornygerman: 40 man as well, big pogs from people even though its bad
[1:30:26] larkhill: brawlers guild would be dope
[1:30:29] Himot: Bring s1 The Maw back!! xdd
[1:30:30] berchberkins: they did say torghast coming back was possible
[1:30:31] Karpaa: MIP farmer thingy to grind and getting allmost nothing
[1:30:31] Strenious: I want small mini raids back, like Trial of Valor
[1:30:32] zannuss: How about MoP Scenarios?
[1:30:32] JohnnyMcCrit: Hey Max, why is Mythic Raid Flex a Problem? @maximum
[1:30:33] antipheonixna: max never did more than 2 warfronts
[1:30:34] Kooznik: Master Looter would def be on it
[1:30:34] yifors: progressive scenarios like withered army and corrupted visions were cool
[1:30:36] surpriseparty20: Any shitty world PVP event  from back in the day ?
[1:30:38] chimneybob: like torghast
[1:30:39] JERAULT: islands with nothing but cosmetic rewards would slap
[1:30:41] biglenk: @Maximum what if Delves end up being an insane system
[1:30:45] audrock7: Dom Shards
[1:30:48] AnabolicFreaks: whats the list for?
[1:30:51] Clarius: Order Halls
[1:30:52] ShaggySummers: gimme proving grounds again >:(
[1:30:52] CMTerp: as someone who barely did islands because i didnt care about heart levels, I didnt think they were interesting or fun either
[1:30:52] levidor1: MOP scenarios LULW
[1:30:53] Hardex: hit/expertise ha jk
[1:30:57] antipheonixna: @Maximum no way they had more content in beta than on live they were shit
[1:31:01] Thoreya: give us horrific visions
[1:31:03] CoffeeASAP: Have group will travel :)
[1:31:04] Kooznik: Actually master looter i feel like, i know u technically could do it
[1:31:05] Ayleas: scenarios (3 man content) in general if you're not including Islands?
[1:31:06] ColdIceCreamMan: they didn't need to put a timer on pve island expeditions. it literally wasn't an expedition just a dumb race. i get the pvp part, but i wanted a chill island experience and not a dumb grind
[1:31:14] ShabsieAU: horrific visions will be in this vid for sure
[1:31:16] jacobtheultimate: @Maximum i personally would like a new version of torghast but different theme and cosmetic rewards only
[1:31:20] drazzil7: That was bad, that broke every 25man run you ever did in icc. Deathbringers will dropped? guess thats that
[1:31:25] ThoseCrazyGuys: Order halls
[1:31:28] cornflakezza: Garnison upgrades with m+ Portals  for every Expansion
[1:31:29] Kooznik: Yea i meant Guild Master looter
[1:31:32] zenkodac: is brawlers guild a system? or just content
[1:31:33] MeisterChiefX: guild master loot with cross faction and cross realm guilds would make a lot of sense to bring back
[1:31:41] MrAndersen_: I dont think you need master loot, you just use addons now
[1:31:45] tayl0rswift2: tayl0rswift2 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 21 months, currently on a 3 month streak! thanks for the content mr maximum
[1:31:55] Zxczack: a fun torghast mode
[1:31:57] Lenzoface: Mage Tower @Maximum  󠀀
[1:31:59] Standy94: The current loot system tilts me
[1:32:01] Rahvin331: They need to bring back bonus rolls on loot.
[1:32:04] stelfbronco: more than 3 raids a expansion
[1:32:05] Grissu_: Maybe a no flying PvP world zone
[1:32:12] grobb12: corruptions
[1:32:13] Nydaend: Legion Personal Loot
[1:32:15] Kooznik: Guild Master loot with personal loot in any other content that isnt guild makes the most sense
[1:32:16] Grissu_: Like wintergrasp
[1:32:16] Gamerhcp: stat reforging
[1:32:16] ThoseCrazyGuys: Order halls 󠀀
[1:32:19] Strenious: Mini raids, like Trial of Valor
[1:32:20] DunzoCD: order halls
[1:32:21] Gamerhcp: stat/gear reforging
[1:32:21] burlin_: order halls
[1:32:21] Thoreya: horrific visions
[1:32:22] Standy94: Bring back Chinese servers !
[1:32:23] Clarius: order halls
[1:32:24] ahri_feet_connoisseur: NEW FURRY RACE
[1:32:24] Diazanite: @grobb12 u need help
[1:32:26] sunsourse: horrific visions
[1:32:26] antipheonixna: pls bring back horrific visions, make them .5 content
[1:32:28] booznoon: titanforging kek
[1:32:29] Divinuss_: fk it Titanforging?
[1:32:29] othernewname: @lenzoface it's not removed
[1:32:29] IdkDream: @Maximum this season is my first season playing and i have to ask, was there ever a better loot system than what it is now? ive done 3 raids for 3 weeks and no loot
[1:32:33] goekenaitor: just rip the cord and put corruptions
[1:32:33] levidor1: @Maximum Torghast, in a good way
[1:32:36] Nagollith: Guild Halls
[1:32:37] jacobtheultimate: yeah
[1:32:38] ShaggySummers: proving grounds to access harder content @Maximum
[1:32:39] Kooznik: Id say scenarios but with Delves coming i feel like its almost the same thing
[1:32:39] zannuss: Scenarios from MoP
[1:32:39] Stalia: artifact weapons?
[1:32:40] Grissu_: they should continue order halls
[1:32:40] Seven_ik: VISIONS POG
[1:32:42] zenkodac: most things people are saying arnt even systems
[1:32:42] Lenzoface: Mage Tower @Maximum
[1:32:43] merzicdh: MOP farms
[1:32:45] Khorvan: Torghast/Horrific Visions but without power attached
[1:32:48] Azoy_: Dinars 󠀀
[1:32:48] jacobtheultimate: like a current expansion version
[1:32:49] Khodo_: garrisons but better
[1:32:51] grobb12: @grobb12 the last iteration with a constant vendor would be fine
[1:32:53] Mecabeast: cove sanctum in sl was basically that
[1:32:54] cornflakezza: legendary raid Mode
[1:32:54] Theliahh: why would you want the playerbase to regularly have to split into 12 separate areas
[1:32:55] Rendlaws: artifact weapons
[1:32:55] Rhemax18: order halls by themselves do nothing, quiesting related to the order halls is a different thing
[1:32:56] Grissu_: @Seven_ik pls no monkaS
[1:32:57] yifors: no way you said torghast
[1:32:57] thenateo2: systems ? Madge
[1:33:01] ahri_feet_connoisseur: just need more endgame content that isnt m+ or raiding
[1:33:02] YdenTV: Corruption
[1:33:04] koxytwitch: rep tabard
[1:33:05] LegacyofTork: lower damage numbers/new squish
[1:33:05] nrozz: Corruptions back would be banger.
[1:33:10] Standy94: Bring back rep grinds!
[1:33:12] Alucian: I'll say it - I miss corruption
[1:33:14] Joneim: Joneim subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 24 months! Wow
[1:33:17] antipheonixna: yes
[1:33:18] JERAULT: warrior hall felt like a locker room
[1:33:20] verzin_: artifacts were cool
[1:33:21] BigTrout3: do you mean "in the game" like you can go back to it?
[1:33:24] ahri_feet_connoisseur: make old raids viable
[1:33:26] Adrang: ashbringer is the thumbnail, so thats likely connected to one of theirs. so they are going to have a questionable take
[1:33:27] Theliahh: corruption was good
[1:33:30] karmaticttv: the old Hit/expetise/defence cap required on the gear?
[1:33:32] Rahvin331: Corruption best system ever
[1:33:37] Joneim: More
[1:33:37] merzicdh: or fun
[1:33:37] Isococo77: More
[1:33:38] Lorrdzik: @JERAULT Wat
[1:33:42] biffhh: perfect time to do it, would be great
[1:33:42] Alucian: More - and Tanks/Healers were everwhere
[1:33:45] IronPhalanX: more
[1:33:45] Drewslock: nothing made me hornier than having 60% haste baseline as a destro lock
[1:33:46] Standy94: Bring back Dalaran! Best major city lol
[1:33:46] shizuma_lol: @karmaticttv nobody wants this
[1:33:46] Khorvan: more
[1:34:01] JERAULT: @JERAULT the warrior order hall smelled of axe body spray and i saw tons of dicks
[1:34:06] booznoon: the millisecond you lose that shit and go from 60% base haste down to 20% tho
[1:34:10] antipheonixna: u can make hero talent questlines for cosmetics, add cosmetic glyphs to class halls,etc.
[1:34:10] karmaticttv: @shizuma_lol me neither, just threw it out there
[1:34:10] Grissu_: but the idea of obtaining it should be different
[1:34:17] Vsplague: You should save this
[1:34:19] Theliahh: going super saiyan every season 4 would be sick
[1:34:26] xxpurplehazen: NOTED
[1:34:32] Khodo_: Khodo_ subscribed at Tier 1. 
[1:34:36] Standy94: They should just move Dalaran every expac lol
[1:34:37] zannuss: I hope whatever food max got is meant to be eaten at room temp
[1:34:37] snipespb: "players want back as the question" i think class identity is gotta be there because so many people want their character to feel more "unique" while ignoring why they made so much over lap was to make sure you didn't "need" specific class
[1:34:45] PrimeTimeRime: the raid buff scrolls. the raid buff scrolls.
[1:34:50] merzicdh: i want season 4 to just go crazy and do something completely different.
[1:35:02] YdenTV: Put a huge drop in there for when aug came out
[1:35:06] Vsplague: AUG
[1:35:08] malnourish_: F  + L + ratio
[1:35:15] Karkesis: I'd argue the talent tree is pretty ambitious
[1:35:15] Standy94: They should change wow to a MOBA for S4
[1:35:18] PurpleKami: I think overhauling the talent system was pretty ambitious
[1:35:24] misran: i mean they were worried enough about thematic continuity that they changed the appearance of covenant abilities.  how do you randomly work corruption in
[1:35:27] ahri_feet_connoisseur: That's what TFT does with every of their sets
[1:35:28] fat_european0: @Maximum Season 4 should be all tier sets active at once
[1:35:36] nickelvc: @Standy94 LUL
[1:35:41] ahri_feet_connoisseur: just go big dick every end of season
[1:35:42] Rahvin331: Need some Twilight Dev and 100% haste
[1:35:51] Clevelandmk: you should be able to have any tier set and just switch for any dj
[1:35:55] Mecabeast: should visions be added to the list speaking of corruption
[1:35:56] zannuss: I miss the no aug system
[1:36:11] drazzil7: The cool hype thing would prob get people back
[1:36:12] CMCam1: horrific visions Pog
[1:36:13] nickelvc: length should probably just be time
[1:36:13] booznoon: more reason to do it imo
[1:36:16] Adrang: arguably that could also means more people play at the end
[1:36:22] Standy94: They should just delete a spec at random every season
[1:36:24] merzicdh: i want season 4 to just go crazy and do something completely different.
[1:36:25] Beard3d_Gamer: incentive to bring people back that like that content
[1:36:28] opticon82: archaeology?
[1:36:32] Steehll: reforging
[1:36:32] zannuss: Scenarios!
[1:36:33] ZordiakZero: MoP Story Scenarios
[1:36:33] ClipCraft: eh just send it
[1:36:35] nickelvc: the graph is wrong for the "length of the expansion"
[1:36:36] Lenzoface: Mage Tower @Maximum
[1:36:39] nrozz: @Maximum but you didn't even put corruptions on the list
[1:36:41] CoffeeASAP: maybe
[1:36:42] ClipCraft: arch is still in the game
[1:36:43] Gamerhcp: gear reforging
[1:36:46] Standy94: Fishing Tournament!
[1:36:46] CoffeeASAP: he do be a nerd
[1:36:49] Quiznuhtodd: Urh, Wo, and Vy.  That's a personal request for season 4.
[1:36:50] ahri_feet_connoisseur: Revamp M+ so it's not dogwater
[1:36:52] Archmage_Michael: me too,  I'm bored with the game. really hope for something cool in S4
[1:36:53] drazzil7: Wither training or mage tower?
[1:36:53] Adrang: you good
[1:36:53] FrilleJr: does grizzly hills count as a system?
[1:36:56] Rhemax18: Mage tower is still in the game
[1:36:56] burnunit_: World PVP!
[1:36:59] PrimeTimeRime: the raid buff scrolls my guy.
[1:37:00] merzicdh: first aid. for sure.
[1:37:00] fat_european0: Artifact weapons
[1:37:01] Hoyabembay: bring a barber becomes an actual profession
[1:37:02] The9thChevron: Not really removed but Pet Battles hasn't had a proper content update since BFA.
[1:37:03] zannuss: Seasonal affixes
[1:37:05] moth43: i know this isnt a system but could he say like harder leveling or something like that? I would fucking hate that but maybe
[1:37:06] ghostchief_: ghostchief_ subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 19 months! valor

[2:02:43] zannuss: Look at my mythic level lfr trinket
[2:02:43] ashlennz: Vision of perfection was amazing in some classes
[2:02:47] goblingher: @Hinzir that shit can stay in hell
[2:02:50] PurpleKami: whoever asked for azerite essences didnt have to farm blood of the enemy and it shows

[2:03:10] Basic_3: Loved some Vision of Perfection
[2:03:13] ArcaneSyntax: i don't watn azerite essences back
[2:03:15] zenkodac: very not my style of grind, i hated the start of this patch

[2:04:03] exz_96: watch the state of wow pvp 8.3 lul
[2:04:05] Hinzir: @Hinzir was best thing loot wise, removed mythic raid requirement in Legion and BFA, made possible for small groups reach best loot possible via M+ only and never feel undergeared compared to mythic raiders
[2:04:06] Mecabeast: there was a thing with that and twilight dev with 20 tanks in mythic raid
[2:04:08] nairb1: SUF pog
[2:04:09] Benjg7: thd on a moonking in that clip KEKW

[2:04:58] CoffeeASAP: COPIUM
[2:04:58] goblingher: Legit dropping retail for classic legion, lets gooooo
[2:04:58] Linith_Heart: COPIUM
[2:04:59] Maldre: the best part of legendaries was getting the good one and laughing at bad rng
[2:05:00] Standy94: copium
[2:05:00] domz_i: Video is bad take
[2:05:02] kelly_mac06: sounds a bit salty lol
[2:05:02] d0mezg4mer: uh oh
[2:05:06] alecx69420: He's probably going to talk about the cosmetic prog
[2:05:10] Archmage_Michael: I want that 895 item

[2:05:13] Thdlock: meanwhile in L FLIGHT ITS LOBBY SIM
[2:05:13] PurpleKami: "completely change" KEKW
[2:05:14] DrCsquared: the only one he’s going to get right is the free space.
[2:05:14] Korupcija_: clearing normal and heroic for legendaries, good times FeelsStrongMan
[2:05:15] mattyydubzz: prydaz and sephuz my first 2 legendaries
[2:05:16] Kooznik: Not tru, my hunter standing still gets me healed isnt in xD
[2:05:16] baseboned: Hiru's vids have been bad for like 2 years now
[2:05:18] Thdlock: BRING BACK BFA / LEGION
[2:05:18] braaahhh: Streaming
[2:05:19] DrBazingaSC: Yeah he's not looking at systems
[2:05:21] PleaseLessen: This list is systems people look back fondly on. Not ones people want back lol
[2:05:21] ArcaneSyntax: the system was the really bad part
[2:05:27] JERAULT: gamble ele Sadge
[2:05:28] KillchainGames: its not the legednary effect its the sense of progression over time people like a splash of grind vertical prog over time
[2:05:29] ZordiakZero: As someone with bad rng, I hated it
[2:05:32] Choderz: bro i had 3 warlocks because of the RNG
[2:05:33] Clarius: YEP
[2:05:34] MeisterChiefX: i got my bis legendary after kj lmao
[2:05:34] joekandy: it was so bad
[2:05:35] braaahhh: xddShrug he's right idc
[2:05:41] enigmasvea: hes saying the last patch is how it should be
[2:05:43] twixxer5: It's the same system for current legendary
[2:05:46] Italicuss: that singular moment though was crisp
[2:05:48] Maldre: i liked legiondaries
[2:05:48] ubi_hs: no it’s not, loot is more fun then talents, same can be said about tier - it’s just talent points
[2:05:49] BLACKFOOT_TN: I got mine pretty quick.
[2:05:50] Joneim: The solution was to just remake your character zzz
[2:05:54] chaosreaper0: he did say at the end of it's life. still kind of mid
[2:06:01] zveranna: Artefacts talents a was good. Artefacts is not good
[2:06:02] Choderz: I got Portal Pants as my first Leggo
[2:06:02] Dharke: couldnt be me getting sephuz and Prydaz as my first 2 leggos
[2:06:03] Flenidalap: I was miserable in Legion because i never got the mage fire bracers. could never compete with other mages and it was annoying
[2:06:05] tehWhilson: imagine playing enhance main and not getting a bis legendary KEK
[2:06:14] malarkey0094: bro is triggered lmao
[2:06:14] Italicuss: next is conduit energy
[2:06:15] zannuss: Bonus rolls will probably be there at least
[2:06:17] MeisterChiefX: yeah this video sucks
[2:06:27] yifors: he has a video, he's clrearly right
[2:06:29] mattyydubzz: This man would love korean mmo's
[2:06:32] mcphatty: i hope blizzard doesn't watch this video, sounds like a fucking terrible game
[2:06:32] Troniin: do you have music playing and the video playing
[2:06:35] Gizmoize: Adge
[2:06:36] Clarius: ure gonna get the last 4!
[2:06:39] CMCam1: put mission tables but not essences or corruption HAH
[2:06:43] BigTheTank: i think glyphs are gonna hit for sure
[2:06:45] zannuss: nah I bet archeology also
[2:06:45] totemic_: bonus rolls is near the top of my list
[2:06:48] ZordiakZero: At this rate, Glyphs have gotta be in it
[2:06:50] Nickystr1x: waiting for him to make a “top 10 moments max guessed wrong about my videos and tilted off the planet” video
[2:06:51] joekandy: love?
[2:06:52] surpriseparty20: Bro If I see those shitty covenant trees in here im gonna go insane
[2:06:58] zannuss: No one had that damn trinket
[2:07:01] zeitgeiz: I hated having those slots and tier slots spoken for
[2:07:05] Darkrunes: that did not exist in my mind
[2:07:07] Clarius: we never saw a single one in our guild
[2:07:10] litixio: @Troniin im pretty sure the video has 2 different songs running
[2:07:10] merzicdh: i hardly seen anybody with that
[2:07:22] CritzGG: We had 1 in our guild
[2:07:26] Earthtusks: I got that on an alt xdd
[2:07:32] zannuss: Lower drop rate then the fyrakk axe
[2:07:33] Lindorn_: i got 1 on my rogue, didnt use it :)
[2:07:37] dorki: it was op early
[2:07:37] Grissu_: I got it on my trash alt hunter from normal kekw
[2:07:45] CladeusXE: never saw that
[2:07:51] zeitgeiz: I want to know how many got it across all characters. one in my guild got it, that included the main guild and 4 alt guilds
[2:07:54] Contravert: sometimes an item is good to be extremely rare, which it makes it.. uhm, rare!
[2:07:56] Thesummerofkevin: arcanocrystal Aware
[2:08:00] Boreall: Did he just say BiS as Bee Eye Ess?
[2:08:00] Taytor: @dorki go back to the mines
[2:08:01] YdenTV: bee eye ess loot
[2:08:05] CMCam1: dorki still on break Susge
[2:08:17] Boreall: This guy triggers my fight or flight response
[2:08:21] Theliahh: he really just doesnt realize this could be talents
[2:08:24] zannuss: I loved leaping across the maps
[2:08:30] zeitgeiz: @boreall lol
[2:08:35] zannuss: Best flag leapper
[2:08:37] dorki: swapping Legos in m+ was cool
[2:08:41] srze94: is there going to be a stat squish for next expac?
[2:08:42] misran: i went 2 months without my ring on DH and then it randomly popped out of a chest in suramar.  great system :)
[2:08:43] Theliahh: like 3 leaps has no need to be a legiondary, just make it a hero talent ?
[2:08:44] Thdlock: typical boomer take classic
[2:08:46] Ithylz: Nostalgia
[2:08:46] drazzil7: They were good because you could switch gear in dungeons!
[2:08:51] YdenTV: Gear swapping in dungeons owned
[2:08:58] Theliahh: gear swapping was garbo
[2:08:58] SeptuGG: Being a blood dk with sephuz was fun
[2:09:02] Korupcija_: it was annoying to swap
[2:09:02] kelly_mac06: noooo gear swapping was fucking GREAT
[2:09:05] goekenaitor: sounds cringe af
[2:09:05] SeptuGG: the speed set
[2:09:06] kelly_mac06: i miss it so much
[2:09:06] Clarius: swapping gear was jarring
[2:09:08] zeitgeiz: yes, throw on an air trinket and sephuz for trash
[2:09:11] athenee: gear swaping was so nice
[2:09:11] zannuss: I want multi-leap back as a talent :(
[2:09:11] dorki: u just played diff from pack to pack
[2:09:14] delacourtv: I miss having like 8 different gear sets.  Like no meme
[2:09:15] zeitgeiz: *aoe trinket
[2:09:18] marchippp: EWWW
[2:09:22] alecx69420: I liked it
[2:09:23] Basic_3: Yeah that sounds like ass
[2:09:26] nezo_pont: gear swapping is for macro pigs, im too lazy for that
[2:09:26] Andyto02: im a scrub i use 0 macros ok
[2:09:27] Pokects: sounds cringe tbh
[2:09:27] ArcaneSyntax: @Maximum max most of us don't have the coggy l to macro that stuff
[2:09:27] Theliahh: nah dawg
[2:09:27] athenee: avodiance gear for high bosses etc
[2:09:28] antipheonixna: was cringe
[2:09:30] zannuss: YAY
[2:09:30] KaisenSiru: Pog
[2:09:32] Lindorn_: it was fun
[2:09:32] DunzoCD: W
[2:09:36] Dzor12: W SO SMART MAX
[2:09:36] PrimeTimeRime: finally
[2:09:37] Kooznik: Chad
[2:09:37] ODLBubs: HE GOT ONE!
[2:09:38] pdghaschel: personal loot is actually something that would be good
[2:09:40] Kooznik: Your on a streak
[2:09:41] ProfessorSollis: That is a big one for me, god I hate it right now
[2:09:43] Standy94: That MOP screen was a bait
[2:09:44] Camelbak21: Bring back personal loot
[2:09:45] CMCam1: Another W take from Max
[2:09:48] Grissu_: Personal loot and bonus roll was good
[2:09:48] zeitgeiz: you had bad overall trinkets you could just throw in for trash or something and made it worth keeping or farming trinkets
[2:09:48] SeptuGG: is Max back?
[2:09:54] AngryStapler: @ProfessorSollis see yourself out of my 2nd channel
[2:09:59] Bupkus: This was basically Free Space
[2:10:03] zannuss: Bonus rolls is probably next
[2:10:15] sunsourse: I'm confused, why to people like personal loot?
[2:10:28] geo2340: What is up with this list, almost every single system has caused tons of issues in the game's history and was hated by people who played the game when it was live
[2:10:32] Theliahh: why is personal loot good
[2:10:32] Basic_3: @sunsourse You can't get Warglaives if you don't have DHs in your group, etc
[2:10:37] Docaan: COPIUM
[2:10:39] Camelbak21: @sunsourse You like having 4 glaives drop that nobody can use on bosses? roflmao
[2:10:40] Hinzir: Personal loot should come back, forced grp loot in Dragonflight is worst thing ever for pugs, i hated every moment of it
[2:10:45] baseboned: because human brains are bad at comprehending probability
[2:10:45] MrAndersen_: @sunsourse no friction between players
[2:10:47] CladeusXE: mabye corruptions but once u get each type they are saved but no pvp ones
[2:10:48] Theliahh: social = bad
[2:10:50] Archmage_Michael: personal is way better
[2:10:52] ZordiakZero: Personal Loot sucked
[2:10:54] totemic_: heroic pugging is suffering from need/greed currently
[2:10:55] bilboswaginzz305: Also no ninja looting
[2:10:56] AngryStapler: and you dont have to lose your good items to a persons 10th alt
[2:10:57] dorki: cause ppl hate having to forfeit loot to filthy raiders
[2:10:57] merzicdh: it feels bad to do 9-12 bosses and get nothing
[2:10:58] Ellasande: hated it. I always got gold
[2:10:58] domz_i: Could you trade personal loot?
[2:10:58] BLACKFOOT_TN: What do you mean YOU people
[2:10:59] Karkesis: if you're not in a dedicated group personal loot is just objectively better that group loot
[2:11:02] fat_european0: It also didn't have a bunch of people needing on items they don't need but want to sell
[2:11:02] PrimeTimeRime: nope
[2:11:04] MeisterChiefX: personal loots definitely better in a pug environment
[2:11:04] vellic4: Killing tindral and having 4 bows drop for one hunter feels bad
[2:11:05] zannuss: I loved getting an item on personal loot and then getting 10 tells asking if I needed it
[2:11:06] Letholas: fully tradeable personal loot would be great
[2:11:06] ProfessorSollis: and Id rather it be that way
[2:11:06] 0_____Kappa: you can get a bunch of useless items nobody needs now
[2:11:13] CladeusXE: ML is the best for guilds
[2:11:14] daevyfan: @geo2340 bringing them back but take away the bad parts and keep the good parts
[2:11:14] Icycutes: personal loot guaranteed some loot
[2:11:14] Lorrdzik: PR is good if you want to get tmog from LFR, current loot system in LFR is trash to get anything
[2:11:15] hotdogmartyr: until 3 hunter bows drop and no hunters are in raid
[2:11:15] PrimeTimeRime: there was bad luck protection with personal loot
[2:11:16] portleys: with need for greed you can just need on shit and sell it too
[2:11:17] Taytor: It also never gave you the idea that it could of been your loot. In the curreny system you see that "This COULD be mine." vs, with personal loot loot was only yours if you got it in PL
[2:11:18] PleaseLessen: personal loot fixed loot dropping for a class not in the group
[2:11:19] athenee: pls perosloot for pugs and guild group loot that was the best combo
[2:11:19] StewiieeGriffin: personal loot made the game worse
[2:11:22] zeitgeiz: at least people can pass on need/greed
[2:11:26] Docaan: lot of shady stuff goes on with master loot
[2:11:30] AngryStapler: good and bad with personal loot
[2:11:30] Boreall: With Need/Greed I'm mad at the player who beat me on the roll, with personal loot I'm mad at the game
[2:11:30] Throckytv: the biggest issue with need / greed, is there's really weird logic on what people can / can't need on. so in heroic pugs you have 487 toons rolling on tier tokens etc. which is bad
[2:11:33] PhaykZ: @Icycutes Nah. I went plenty of raids with 0 loot during personal loot
[2:11:36] Lindorn_: pug lifers are wild
[2:11:38] eolin89: @Maximum As a healer i want persoloot back
[2:11:40] Rapunzele: PL > ML
[2:11:47] yifors: i raided for 3 months and saw a tier piece for my class drop twice, all my tier i got it from vault
[2:11:51] baseboned: a lot of shady stuff doesn't happen with master loot, that's an absolute made up concern
[2:11:51] AngryStapler: more m+ gear drops Madge
[2:11:52] zannuss: Class stacking
[2:11:55] Byggareebob: they should just ahve both options and you get to play the loot rule you want
[2:11:56] smolderdaddyuwu: smolderdaddyuwu subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 24 months! happy 2 years @Maximum :)
[2:12:04] surpriseparty20: Go sword spec guys
[2:12:11] Taytor: The classic 18 person leather stack
[2:12:12] zenkodac: you could mega funnel gear yea
[2:12:25] sep514: @Maximum did you find it easier / have to run fewer splits during personal loot era?
[2:12:50] audrock7: Season 4 of DF will bring in Dream Shards the DF equivalent of Dom Shards
[2:12:51] Throckytv: KEKW
[2:12:55] ForgantMapper: My 2 guilds collapsed on dragonflight because of the loot conflicts
[2:13:01] Standy94: Blizz hates big streamers sadge
[2:13:12] Throckytv: ForgantMapper so you've been in a guild of babies
[2:13:14] Drenwow: man the splits and firedup with no space on his bags with a huge amount of useless items made me ocd
[2:13:15] smolderdaddyuwu: I missed bonus rolls.. :(
[2:13:16] baseboned: guilds disbanding because of loot bs isn't new lmao
[2:13:19] zannuss: Wait is he putting bonus rolls with personal loot?
[2:13:26] StreamElements: Subscribe to HelloFresh and use my code POGHF121355 to receive one free breakfast item per box while subscription is active https://strms.net/hellofresh_maximum #ad
[2:13:27] Lorrdzik: @ForgantMapper that was one horrible guild then
[2:13:32] deadman385: i dont get it @Maximum are you saying personal loot is worst
[2:13:34] CladeusXE: if u could trade the bonus loot
[2:13:47] Theliahh: it did not remove loot drama because as soon as something was tradeable it would be drama
[2:13:49] baseboned: no it didn't
[2:13:54] baseboned: dead loot still dropped
[2:13:54] zenkodac: cant say i miss personal loot a lot cus i never really used it, honestly i always got gear faster form my guild then waiting for my shit rng to give me something
[2:14:05] ghostchief_: i did not mind personal loot. but kinda have a love/hate for the new loot system
[2:14:06] zenkodac: from*
[2:14:06] drazzil7: From a guild POV personal loot sucks, but from a pug POV personal loot is great
[2:14:13] Theliahh: Operation SAVE JPC
[2:14:17] smolderdaddyuwu: ^
[2:14:17] antisprime: personal loot NAH
[2:14:22] Miril9: that's because of trade restrictions though not personal loot itself
[2:14:22] MrAndersen_: @Maximum if they removed the ilvl req from personal loot it would be better imo
[2:14:24] Basic_3: Very much a week 1 issue though
[2:14:27] MrAndersen_: than need/g
[2:14:28] Basic_3: Basically only applicable to you guys
[2:14:29] mattyydubzz: personal definitely more appealing for casuals
[2:14:34] Icycutes: personal in pugs, master in guilds. fixed
[2:14:36] Grissu_: maybe if you could choose as a raid leader would be good
[2:14:39] Throckytv: Miril9 the trade restrictions are part of personal loot the system
[2:14:41] domz_i: There's a reason why these systems are no longer in the game.
[2:14:50] Leredi: with current loot, as pug players unable to play
[2:14:55] Thdlock: legion had the solution 80% of raid grp in guild master loot GIGACHAD
[2:15:02] Miril9: @Throckytv except they can do it like now and have no restrictions
[2:15:21] Throckytv: the reason there's no restriction is because of the loot sytem
[2:15:25] Basic_3: ML is pretty terrible for tanks & healers.
[2:15:26] portleys: need/greed causes my guild to have healers and tanks geared first yay
[2:15:52] baseboned: it's only bad for tanks and healers that aggree to be in guilds that prio loot to dps
[2:15:58] healapotamus: why not just be able to choose which it is before the raid starts?
[2:16:00] PleaseLessen: I think the fact that they didn't just make it an option is odd. There is no reason that personal and group loot can't coexist
[2:16:04] yifors: @portleys guilds doing it backwards bruh
[2:16:07] Noxara_: @Maximum but it gave us that DH clip of the dude not giving up loot cause he was a child :)
[2:16:14] s3ns3y322: with personal u can farm some staff what u really need, like trinket or weapon, but now u cant :(
[2:16:20] healapotamus: boom we got both
[2:16:24] kullkhan: The reverse of this is though ALOT of guilds do really cancer loot council stuff for casuals and non world first raiders.  IE giving loot only to officers or friends
[2:16:26] kullkhan: happens alot
[2:16:26] muzzaie96: personal loot is goated. recieving an ilevel upgrade and not having raid members btich about it felt incredible
[2:16:34] baseboned: @s3ns3y322 what are you talking about?
[2:16:36] NotDillyTV: NotDillyTV subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 15 months! 
[2:16:37] f9ftw: ayyh
[2:16:38] Karkesis: for sure
[2:16:39] f9ftw: yaah
[2:16:39] Clarius: YEP
[2:16:39] totemic_: YEP
[2:16:40] darkness79317: artifact weapons are gonna be on the list
[2:16:41] NykolasRage: Blizzard are the masters of micro managing how you play
[2:16:41] drazzil7: He also added reroll tokens in the personal loot (so you got 2 in 1)
[2:16:42] f9ftw: true
[2:16:44] Rhemax18: agre
[2:16:46] dorki: best is u just get ur own loot from tokens ez
[2:16:47] Jjmn12: what about peer pressure D:
[2:16:50] Throckytv: muzzaie96 wym, why would you not want to gear your raid to kill stuff
[2:16:53] Ithylz: Keep PL for non-guild group as it was and you're good
[2:16:53] Hinzir: best is personal loot wtihout any trade, so guilds cant even make loot councils
[2:16:55] tsetaini: thats just msater loot with extra steps
[2:16:55] bamjaman: good take max as usual
[2:16:56] PrimeTimeRime: yeh big agree
[2:17:04] SasiriHS: its personal loot if i just joined a guild and master if the officers are gobbling my glizzy
[2:17:04] Theliahh: make all loot tokens and you buy loot from a vendor
[2:17:05] vynistrian: true
[2:17:06] Basic_3: I liked personal loot, but I wish they'd fix the MH/OH issue and the trinkets.
[2:17:14] Razdruid: oh @Maximum just watched the poddy c the reason they changed asure vault is because people were complaining they were getting kicked from groups because they wanted to do the quest.
[2:17:15] Miril9: so personal loot without trade restrictions
[2:17:16] baseboned: @Hinzir find a guild without loot council
[2:17:26] Throckytv: like if you're raiding to kill bosses, you should want gear to be distributed in a way that makes it easiest to kill bosses, not what ever is best for your character
[2:17:27] Clarius: u used to be able to choose back in Legion
[2:17:27] Camelbak21: 100%
[2:17:28] Standy94: get rid of loot all together
[2:17:33] Clarius: no clue why they dint do that in DF
[2:17:34] s3ns3y322: @baseboned i need like rogue daagger, i can go with 30 rogues and have a lot more chance do get it, now i can go with 30 rogues and get like 30 bows :(
[2:17:36] Imorteus: healers etc for sure
[2:17:39] Culver42: Yep!
[2:17:45] VRVento: AOTC guilds for sure would want that
[2:17:49] healapotamus: when you choose normal, heroic, or mythic just be able to choose the loot method
[2:17:51] mjayzx2: i expect all the loot going in my bags
[2:17:55] muzzaie96: @Throckytv at some point gear doesn't matter in killing bosses. most bosses are skill checks with mostly mythic gaer
[2:18:01] daevyfan: @dorki illidan's warglaives must drop from illidan 😡
[2:18:02] board4life65: thats a bad loot rule
[2:18:04] Hinzir: @Hinzir they did not exist, even if they exist they are 1 in a  million
[2:18:05] Camelbak21: Need greed in LFR for example is 'nam
[2:18:09] Sylibusttv: We are 6/9M, we are straight Need/Greed rolls
[2:18:09] baseboned: how many people can form a group of 30 people willing to trade them what they want? that's a non reason
[2:18:11] Icycutes: false
[2:18:17] roookai: yeah we had no rogues in my aotc guild and we dropped a dagger damn every boss
[2:18:22] healapotamus: purrfect 🐈
[2:18:35] Throckytv: muzzaie96 so then loot is irrelevant in that sitaution? early in the season choosing to gear people to increase probability of killing bosses is good.
[2:18:35] kullkhan: @Throckytv Sure but there are also situations where you 5 ilvl downs but because you're just massively better then the worst player they give gear to that person.  Who probably doesn't deserve it or shouldn't be there.  Happens ALOT and alot of guilds have no business doing it at all imo
[2:18:43] Jazrial: @Maximum What if it was need or greed but only dropped what the comp could use?
[2:19:08] MrAndersen_: i feel like that could have been 1 option? "loot options"
[2:19:11] CMCam1: yeah that was ass
[2:19:12] Grissu_: exactly
[2:19:12] Choderz: Mcconnell Ret
[2:19:17] CladeusXE: yeah thats stupid
[2:19:19] Throckytv: kullkhan wym, your ml is trolling? leave and go to a different guild. that sounds like a shit guild to be in where they don't gear their better players.
[2:19:25] planooooooooooooooooooooo: or someone needing an item and watching your friend loot it for the second time
[2:19:29] Rhemax18: Personal loot without trade restrictions is the perfect system
[2:19:43] Dniceely: yeah that thing is shit
[2:19:47] CMCam1: arcane mages looting mana trinkets
[2:19:57] CladeusXE: @Choderz LUL True
[2:20:00] Razdruid: personal loot would fix the issue of someone thats 475 taking my LFR loot when I am trying to gear my alt.
[2:20:02] Grissu_: and also there's no ninja loots LUL
[2:20:04] bulbazor: or when you have a staff and you get a 1h or an off hand, and you cant trade it at all since you dont have one at that lvl either.
[2:20:19] healapotamus: any level
[2:20:21] wasp234: wasp234 subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 7 months! Pog
[2:20:22] Hinzir: @Rhemax18 its no different than master loot for guilds, because loot council exist, they force trials not getting any loot for a month
[2:20:24] kullkhan: @Throckytv Sure but its happened in 5 different guilds  Specially more casual ones.  It's a massive PROBLEM in semi casual guilds.  its even made worse then you do high lvl M+ and other guildies don't  Stopped raiding this tier for this reason alone.
[2:20:41] Throckytv: kullkhan sounds like you shouldn't casually raid.
[2:20:42] healapotamus: let grown ups grown up
[2:20:43] Boreall: He means the funtionality in game
[2:20:54] Miril9: personal loot for pugs and choice between personal and master for guild groups, both with no trade restrictions
[2:20:58] Rapunzele: only small amount of people know how to use ML, thats way PL is way better
[2:21:00] MeisterChiefX: need for greeds kinda annoying when people dont pass on loot when addons break
[2:21:11] kullkhan: @Throckytv Yeah I guess that's true, fuck the majority of the player base :P /s
[2:21:15] Crucaider: DKP came from EverQuest
[2:21:18] ZordiakZero: DKP is the most unnecessary system to ever exist
[2:21:19] Crucaider: It predated everything
[2:21:19] planooooooooooooooooooooo: GoodTake
[2:21:21] mcphatty: dkp the most corrupt system ever
[2:21:21] love4juju: your lucky
[2:21:23] Uutef: dkp was bad
[2:21:25] Throckytv: kullkhan huh
[2:21:31] OldPplGaming: good god that was painful to manage
[2:21:32] Grissu_: epgp was way better
[2:21:32] jonesth: i was in a DKP Kara guild in TBC... miserable
[2:21:34] Throckytv: kullkhan imagine arguing this way lmao
[2:21:36] Spacejelly: it was bad
[2:21:38] kullkhan: It's ok to admit that neither system is perfect.  I'm just saying personal loot is alot better for casuals
[2:21:42] smolderdaddyuwu: MINUS 50K DKP
[2:21:43] ZordiakZero: DKP was just people's way to steal loot
[2:21:46] healapotamus: DKP was it
[2:21:46] EIoquence: more dots
[2:21:47] joekandy: decent idea. plays out terribly because people are degens
[2:21:48] Throckytv: dkp is shit
[2:21:50] yifors: dkp is dogshit
[2:21:51] BbreakGaming: MANY WHELPS
[2:21:52] StantonSC: i remember dkp, it was good since i was there every week and got lots of points
[2:21:56] PrimeTimeRime: dkp worst system in history
[2:22:04] Dniceely: thats like the chinese credit system
[2:22:06] healapotamus: attendance loot
[2:22:16] kullkhan: @Throckytv I mean you stoped engaging but just saying play hardcore or super serious raiding.  That's your only solution.  that is not the majority of the player base
[2:22:18] surpriseparty20: A friend of mine joined a DKP guild in Classic when Molten Core came out
[2:22:18] srze94: dkp is only bad with bad raid leaders, otherwise it is fine
[2:22:26] i_wish_southbadboy: kick everyone in raid to ninja 4Head
[2:22:28] thenateo2: maybe he wants no loot in the game at all @Maximum
[2:22:28] CladeusXE: uh false asmons server
[2:22:31] Docaan: true
[2:22:32] Choderz: I ninja looted the Black War Mammoth
[2:22:33] healapotamus: I miss loot ninjas
[2:22:33] BaronOz94: the inclusion is because we want the choice of either of these
[2:22:37] Rhemax18: @Hinzir not really, if you're a trial on a guild and you get an item via personal loot you could just not trade it if you're not on board with their loot strategies (why you would join that guild knowing that, is a whole different topic) but you could just keep the item, hat you looted, it might get you benched/kicked, but the loot is still yours, it's not like they can take it off your bags
[2:22:37] tsetaini: dkp was annyoing to maintain and keep track off
[2:22:37] BaronOz94: not to be locked to one or the other
[2:22:50] Throckytv: kullkhan yeah becuase if you're casual it shouldn't matter cus you're casual. If you care about performance play in a guild where performance is rewarded.
[2:22:56] ahri_feet_connoisseur: essaying
[2:22:58] CMCam1: both voices are loud
[2:22:58] sukoWoW: people still used some form of DKP in classic on relaunch. its mostly loot council (master loot) in classic now but yeah
[2:23:14] healapotamus: I wish I could name my ton LootNinja
[2:23:22] healapotamus: toon
[2:23:32] Niksen_99: I bet you blizzard is losing money from banning gdkp
[2:23:36] PaCozzz: "fuck RMT, except when you buy tokens" is blizzards stance
[2:23:39] planooooooooooooooooooooo: gdkp is degenerate af
[2:23:45] Throckytv: kullkhan youre entire argument hinges on players in casual guilds wanting to play competitively in other content or in raid. and if gear isn't being distributed in a way that allows you to be competitive you need to find a competitive group.
[2:23:48] Chamiunt: HAH
[2:23:50] thenateo2: HAH
[2:23:50] ZordiakZero: Anyone who uses DKP/GDKP now is just trying to steal loot
[2:23:51] darkness79317: called it
[2:23:52] Faraday5001: HAH x6
[2:23:53] sibrobro: HAH thd
[2:23:53] Jazzarus_: HAH
[2:23:57] ahri_feet_connoisseur: HIRUMA BASED
[2:23:57] reymargera: HAH didnt get it
[2:23:59] Kunoki: whats the score?
[2:24:00] Korupcija_: we sacrificed our weapons to save azeroth
[2:24:03] kullkhan: @Throckytv So if your casual in raiding but serious in another aspect you should be punished? I like mythic plus and alot of raid pieces are BIS by far.  Again I'm saying that the current looting system is a problem and you saying well DO x thing instead and stop whining is a terrible counter argument
[2:24:05] board4life65: bring back AP!!!
[2:24:10] CladeusXE: turning into poe
[2:24:10] asd123qwerty1: HAH
[2:24:11] BoatGuyM: The cosmetics were cool but grinding the fuckin juice was horrid
[2:24:14] RequisiteOfED: dude wants to be super man, artifact and legendaries in every slot
[2:24:16] Thdlock: back when wow was about fun and not lobby simulator BASED
[2:24:21] DunzoCD: it was not very fun not getting new weapons for a whole expansion
[2:24:23] R1CH4RD00M: but god damn it felt good to drop weapon again after legion
[2:24:23] Docaan: all at the same time
[2:24:25] healapotamus: most casual guilds are 10 people carrying the other 10
[2:24:27] fat_european0: @Thdlock BASED
[2:24:27] Kemplore: In 10 years we gonna bitch about wanting hero talents back
[2:24:29] KillchainGames: what if they added another gear slot called artifact item or whatever its like a third trinket slot
[2:24:32] tsetaini: just because people want them back doesnt mean it would be a good idea
[2:24:35] Icycutes: we just want cool looking weapons, all new weapons are ugly
[2:24:35] KillchainGames: and they have it as evergreen system
[2:24:36] bengawow: L take on poe
[2:24:38] Throckytv: kullkhan yes, you should. Becuase if you're being competitive, and your guild can't even kill bosses in a timely manner, you're not actually competing with the top end.
[2:24:38] whoknowsdude_: why are you even watching this, all bad takes
[2:24:41] Detrect: no1 wants azerite back, azerite gear was terrible
[2:24:41] Ithylz: Do your MSQ to get everything Kappa
[2:24:49] MrCasual_: Idk, it really isnt any different than waiting for a new tier and going after the 1 weapon you want for your class, artifact weapons were vastly more interesting and offered more optiosn to change gameplay
[2:24:54] StantonSC: i feel that way about professions in DF
[2:24:56] smolderdaddyuwu: I've enjoyed gathering the artifacts recently and getting skins. if anything make more skins to collect.
[2:25:01] Kunoki: Max, i started playing Legion in the last patch, i thought it was easy to catch up and I love the transmogs. I think people like the transmogs more than anything tbh
[2:25:09] ayoSwis: ayoSwis subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 2 months, currently on a 2 month streak! ayoo
[2:25:09] minikori: having a guaranteed high ilvl weapon all xpac was v nice
[2:25:10] StantonSC: if you got late start your screwed
[2:25:13] baseboned: you expected a logical practical take?
[2:25:15] Byggareebob: @Maximum i want the order halls and class halls back they are so cool and just left in the void
[2:25:15] TorvusBug: one of the takes of all time
[2:25:19] JackOfAllApocalypses: @StantonSC extremely true, actually...you fall SO far behind
[2:25:27] sTumPy222: but maybe they could make weapons with skilltrees and each weapon has a unique skilltree... but that would be hell of a nightmare to balance and so on
[2:25:27] healapotamus: hope I get Iridal in the vault tomorrow
[2:25:28] baseboned: please dont draw another chart
[2:25:28] zveranna: Me need talented out of artifacts
[2:25:32] Nixel_: I miss borrowed power
[2:25:34] smolderdaddyuwu: I just want more artifact skins now.
[2:25:42] surpriseparty20: Where is THD when we need him the most
[2:25:47] Thdlock: back  when wow was about fun and not lobby simulator BASED
[2:25:49] ShowDUH: @minikori You still had to drop the relic for ilvl
[2:25:51] vaironixx: df has less lows but the highs are lower as well
[2:25:52] Korupcija_: man legion was so good
[2:25:54] antipheonixna: its not worth the problems, look how chill and free we've been
[2:26:02] healapotamus: all power is borrowed- not however
[2:26:05] antipheonixna: they need to make more content is all there is rn
[2:26:06] karmaticttv: I don't mind Artifact wep, but only the cosmetic part of it.
[2:26:07] RaellynXO: AP grind sucked though
[2:26:11] healapotamus: mog
[2:26:12] ascendence94: @Maximum idk if he means all of these systems but if we were to have somthing back mabey somthing on the list that what it comes off as to me
[2:26:12] valk113: Artifacts Could have been evergreen
[2:26:19] Niksen_99: Feel like people cope so hard with legion. Same with wrath
[2:26:25] OsyrissTV: @Maximum instead of bad luck on weapon drops, you get bad luck on weapon rune drops x3 LUL
[2:26:25] Hinzir: @Nixel_ totally agree, DF killed solo main character progression. It focused too much on easiness of having an alt. Atm there is nothing to work for.
[2:26:34] kullkhan: @Throckytv I mean I got aotc in the first two weeks and got a few mythic boss kills in decemeber.  Am I a god gamer in raiding no? but how is that casual.  But I do know that I wasn't even allowed to roll on most fyrakk and tindral drops because I was preforming.  That's a problem unique to loot council.  Which is again why I'm saying its  massive problem in casual guilds.  You're not even entertaining it.  it doesn't punish no world first guilds and only affects the top % of raiders.
[2:26:36] antipheonixna: u could only play one of ur specs in the first patches of legion, never forget how fucked the game has been at times
[2:26:40] Korupcija_: nah I like getting weapons
[2:26:41] enigmasvea: youre stupid
[2:26:43] bamjaman: yes
[2:26:50] jonesth: how about class campaigns and not the weapons? that was the best part
[2:26:52] Baskkov: why is there maintenance on eu?
[2:26:54] Soulstrikes: its class hall and artifact weapon that makes it good
[2:26:56] DuckHS: I would hate never looting another wep again
[2:26:57] bevo70: GIFT me a sub!
[2:26:59] planooooooooooooooooooooo: Catge
[2:27:00] Blisslol: Blisslol subscribed with Prime. 
[2:27:01] TorvusBug: upgrading or imbuing a weapon doesn't feel as good as looting a banger weapon
[2:27:03] RequisiteOfED: dopamine drop
[2:27:03] adardrae: yes wrong
[2:27:05] KillchainGames: so wrong
[2:27:07] KillchainGames: hate it
[2:27:09] Theliahh: yeah that would be terrible
[2:27:09] valk113: it does its the flaw of artifacts,
[2:27:09] DocThuggly: I quit that expansion cause weapons didn't drop
[2:27:11] baseboned: super lame
[2:27:11] CladeusXE: yea
[2:27:12] corgio1318: so like the lego weapon now them
[2:27:12] baseboned: yes
[2:27:13] goblingher: eh
[2:27:13] antipheonixna: class hall evergreen>artifact weapon
[2:27:13] JERAULT: i hated not looting a weapon for one whole xpac, fuck that
[2:27:15] eric10008: I did not like it during legion
[2:27:16] roookai: i like crafting
[2:27:17] fu2ad: it like lost ark
[2:27:18] goblingher: Loved artifact weapons
[2:27:19] Blisslol: DK's not reforging the frostmourne on legion was the most wrong wow ever did
[2:27:21] zeitgeiz: I did miss looting weapons but it was fun for an expansion
[2:27:22] Rhemax18: looting a weapon is one of the most exciting things in wow
[2:27:22] booznoon: yes wrong but having the literal ashbringer and then ditching it is also beans
[2:27:22] srze94: some classes depend on wpns too much tho
[2:27:26] Engram08: we would be crying for the removal of artifact weapons if we still had them
[2:27:31] Jabronie_808: maw of souls grind lol
[2:27:31] wpprrz: @DocThuggly Pepega
[2:27:37] Throckytv: kullkhan that's not a casual guild. if you perform that way you should JOIN A BETTER GUILD who gears their better players.
[2:27:38] zenkodac: can you even have artifact wepons without AP? do they start full power?
[2:27:46] antipheonixna: didnt feel wrong during so shruge
[2:27:49] Ithylz: It could be something you put on any weapon but working as artefacts
[2:27:53] Ithylz: Like a gem
[2:27:56] booznoon: concordance was pretty beans too
[2:27:56] Korupcija_: ap world quest swoops FeelsStrongMan
[2:28:01] Deadzachtv: @Maximum how would u feel if it was like, weapons dropped, but there were also artifact weaps in the game, they just do it to somehow support multiple playstyles
[2:28:03] kullkhan: @Throckytv Except then i'm a trial and not allowed to ROLL.  SEE THE PROBLEM lol
[2:28:06] healapotamus: ilvl cap is kind of crap
[2:28:06] bulbazor: bad at the start, good at the end = all borrowed powers we have had
[2:28:09] PurpleKami: It was easier to grind it on an alt than on a different one of your class spec which was giga fucking cringe
[2:28:19] Throckytv: kullkhan no good guild doesn't gear trials this isn't classic wow
[2:28:21] NewGuyLT: trial of valor was 54 grind, no?
[2:28:24] kullkhan: @Throckytv Which is why I quit raiding.
[2:28:25] ZordiakZero: AP should have capped by the time you reached level cap and should not be something you need to hard grind after

[2:28:36] Throckytv: ah ok kullkhan you don't play the game
[2:28:36] baseboned: can people stop arguing about loot, you're not going to convience each other, and unless youre in the same guild it doesn't matter if you disagree, just stop
[2:28:38] Hinzir: as someone said in chat, BRING  BACK BORROWED POWER and AP POWER grinds but with reasonable levels. DF has nothing to work for. Zero progression feel.

[2:29:37] smolderdaddyuwu: I mean I got aotc in the first two weeks and got a few mythic boss kills in decemeber. Am I a god gamer in raiding no? but how is that casual. But I do know that I wasn't even allowed to roll on most fyrakk and tindral drops because I was preforming. That's a problem unique to loot council. Which is again why I'm saying its massive problem in casual guilds. You're not even entertaining it. it doesn't punish no world first guilds and only affects the top % of raiders.

[2:29:51] CladeusXE: if it was cross toons that would be sick
[2:29:52] fat_european0: @Maximum People like having something to grind for the first 2-3 weeks of a patch. We kinda saw that with so many grinding seeds this patch
[2:29:53] tsetaini: I am very much degenarete
[2:29:56] Kryous: Amen
[2:29:57] luxumbra69: I mean I got aotc in the first two weeks and got a few mythic boss kills in decemeber. Am I a god gamer in raiding no? but how is that casual. But I do know that I wasn't even allowed to roll on most fyrakk and tindral drops because I was preforming. That's a problem unique to loot council. Which is again why I'm saying its massive problem in casual guilds. You're not even entertaining it. it doesn't punish no world first guilds and only affects the top % of raiders.
[2:29:59] kullkhan: @Throckytv Ok bud if you say so.  I have numerous characters who have the same name as this twitch account.  Regardless, you just don't understand what joining a casual guild is like when you're doing content early.  Alot of bad guilds out there that have no business doing RC loot council whch seems to be mandatory for most guilds
[2:30:02] Korupcija_: Chatting
[2:30:03] healapotamus: @stantonsc on my warrior sure

[2:30:35] Rottee: that cobolt grind for a ring
[2:30:37] planooooooooooooooooooooo: "yooo i'm 385 ilvl! so sick!"
[2:30:38] hyeheal: farming rares is fun
[2:30:41] sleepinsane: what is aotc
[2:30:41] Felovar: I did like feeling like I was getting stronger from everything I did. But I wonder if that's only because I needed to do everything for a chance at a bis leggo
[2:30:43] sethron: clicking seeds
[2:30:44] totemic_: it mattered for pug raiding
[2:30:45] Basic_3: People complaining they were being "forced" to harvest Dirt was hilarious.
[2:30:46] wraghelm: grinding is sick at the beginning. I did like 100 keys Wk 1
[2:30:51] theholycow: basement key farming
[2:30:52] kyr_slowbro: start of DF was so much fun

[2:31:07] JPKaldy: JPKaldy subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 11 months! 
[2:31:08] JERAULT: i grinded that stupid fucking fishing mount in the beginning of legion and it was some of the most fun i had
[2:31:16] nightst314: you needed 1000 anima per week
[2:31:19] Korupcija_: that's problem with wow, everything feels irrelevant except raid/dungeon
[2:31:32] Slize_5: I think everyone loves it because you can get the "best" gear for that period of time just by playing the game, doesn't matter the difficulty. If you put in the time you could be really geared
[2:31:33] holla____: the maw was a breath of fresh air xdd
[2:31:34] luxumbra69: having weekly required anima was BEANS.
[2:31:36] KillchainGames: the AP grind should just slowly increse paragon like levels for your toon increasing primary stat by like 1 for every level ground
[2:31:44] ShowDUH: @Korupcija_ That's why they are trying Delve next xpac :)
[2:31:47] Woussy: Yep, do your thorgast .... and log off KEKW
[2:31:47] tatertott1: wish you could check vault loot through app

[2:32:10] thenateo2: DansGame
[2:32:11] ZordiakZero: Did they make D4 a playable game?
[2:32:11] CladeusXE: i had like us 8 for neck before prepatch so degen LUL

[2:32:22] daevyfan: @Korupcija_ whenever they make non raid/dungeon relevent, everyone hates it
[2:32:23] healapotamus: there should be a way to continue to grind after 489(now) just slow it down alot
[2:32:24] Throckytv: that's delves @Maximum
[2:32:24] sleepinsane: @StewiieeGriffin is that the game here you cant swivel the camera?
[2:32:25] zebracak35: The torgahst in beta
[2:32:27] Grissu_: from beta
[2:32:29] wpprrz: WTF
[2:32:29] Korupcija_: torghast but not grey
[2:32:30] Docaan: Yea torghast had potential
[2:32:32] thebeam_stream: visions?
[2:32:34] planooooooooooooooooooooo: explain how Madge
[2:32:34] Lambuga: the idea was very good
[2:32:34] surpriseparty20: Reading on the lore= search wowhead
[2:32:35] mattyydubzz: torghast that only has cosmetic rewards
[2:32:36] DankWizard420: the torghast in beta looked good
[2:32:39] Kryous: @daevyfan Facts
[2:32:41] athenee: i wanted a infinite thorgast just to have fun aslong i want
[2:32:45] kh0nan: corruptions were heat
[2:32:46] wraghelm: what is torghast as someone who doesn’t know
[2:32:47] Serenity1942: Torghast as a leaderboard, not as a source of power
[2:32:52] Hedonismbot777: Give me the scenery of Island Expeditions with the gameplay of Alpha Torghast.
[2:32:59] zenkodac: yea i want Beta torghast that would eb fun
[2:33:00] Hinzir: torghast should be roguelike dungeon as in beta with 80 floors
[2:33:02] delacourtv: Nothing made me happier than killing Tarragrue or w/e he was called in Torghast on beta
[2:33:02] Korupcija_: @daevyfan those people that hate it don't play the game anyway
[2:33:03] zenkodac: be*
[2:33:03] JackOfAllApocalypses: I liked the...wtf were they called? the fake-Stormwind/Orgrimmar old god thing in BFA
[2:33:05] ZordiakZero: Torghast was fun for a very short time, and hell on alts
[2:33:08] wpprrz: Merge Legion tower and torghast
[2:33:12] roookai: xdd
[2:33:15] bulbazor: I just heard a lot of people want a mage tower back, but with new shit.
[2:33:15] Finear: jailers gaunltet was sooo good, took me a month to finish last layer on rogue, it was one of the hardest thing i ever done in wow lol
[2:33:16] srze94: most powers were also lame so you ended up fishing for the best ones
[2:33:17] Basic_3: @JackOfAllApocalypses Horrific Visions
[2:33:20] DankWizard420: @JackOfAllApocalypses visions
[2:33:20] planooooooooooooooooooooo: BabyRage where is my acid rain power
[2:33:23] antipheonixna: islands had more content in beta too @Maximum ppl forget that it had more events and stuff
[2:33:25] Ithylz: Crazy how it turned because they didn't listen to feedback back then. Fortunately they've changed that
[2:33:27] suncake_xd: @wraghelm something which was supposed to be a roguelike tower, turned out to be a grind too easy for everyone and a chore
[2:33:32] m3shu: Susge
[2:33:32] CladeusXE: they did visions to pre pare for tohgast i think
[2:33:35] roookai: oof
[2:33:35] FingolfinTTV: choreghast
[2:33:37] nightst314: survival game and axed?
[2:33:40] Icycutes: that guy got fired now
[2:33:45] Clarius: why tf would they move him 2 months before release lmfao
[2:33:49] smolderdaddyuwu: its reforging! did I get it right?
[2:33:54] JackOfAllApocalypses: @Basic_3 RIGHT...horrific visions...those were cool, I liked those
[2:33:59] DankWizard420: reforging modCheck
[2:34:05] planooooooooooooooooooooo: REFORGING LETSGO
[2:34:09] DunzoCD: Pog reforging
[2:34:10] CritzGG: This was so good
[2:34:11] Karkesis: Prayge
[2:34:13] nightst314: nooo
[2:34:15] sukoWoW: need reforging
[2:34:18] srze94: yep thank you now please yes
[2:34:24] luxumbra69: @JackOfAllApocalypses having so much player power hinge on somehtnig tyou only get one chance per week is AWFUL.
[2:34:26] CladeusXE: that was a good system
[2:34:27] Hinzir: all the good things got removed from game because of raid loggers crying. They only want to raid, nothing else.
[2:34:28] DankWizard420: "we removed reforging because everyone spreadsheeted it" ..meanwhile that happens now anyway KEKW
[2:34:36] mattyydubzz: Yeah reforging was fantastic, simple and effective with no grind required
[2:34:37] Baskkov: why is there maintenance in eu?
[2:34:40] zeitgeiz: just don’t bring it back and make it an infinite scaling gold sink like azerite power
[2:34:44] antipheonixna: reforging being added would give u one drop of happiness for a second then u would forget all about it, stats arent that cool anymore
[2:34:56] gnarlyshark: bring back void storage
[2:35:01] planooooooooooooooooooooo: reforging would help itemization so so much
[2:35:02] CladeusXE: then warforged starts.....
[2:35:02] Basic_3: Oh boy, I love asking a robot how to reforge all my gear every time I get a piece.
[2:35:04] srze94: but make reforging available on a blacksmith's hammer so you dont have to travel back and forth
[2:35:07] TeamLiquid: Looking to take your gameplay to the next level? Learning a new class and would like some pointers? Head on over to our discord go.adv.gg/6tAoHx to schedule a coaching session with your favorite Team Liquid raider!
[2:35:12] rhithmx: I need to rewatch that
[2:35:16] CoffeeASAP: I think of reforging like that wolverine picture frame meme
[2:35:17] nellfin: @gnarlyshark it's still there
[2:35:20] ahri_feet_connoisseur: where is titanforging
[2:35:20] DunzoCD: @gnarlyshark its still there
[2:35:21] Korupcija_: Looking
[2:35:29] Theliahh: Looking
[2:35:30] FailRush_: !chair
[2:35:31] Icycutes: we got reforging in crafting now
[2:35:34] baseboned: with only 4 stats, reforging is nothing
[2:35:35] gnarlyshark: make it cool again
[2:35:39] Rhemax18: @Basic_3 that's exactly the same as simming your character everytime you get a loot piece lol
[2:35:42] holla____: garf bla frag
[2:35:45] Razdruid: @Icycutes false
[2:35:47] Hedonismbot777: Would make getting bad rings/amulets in your vault a lot less dogshit.
[2:35:48] StantonSC: @gnarlyshark i still have my T1-T4 in void storage lol
[2:35:50] zeitgeiz: I don’t want something dropping and a person here thing to reforge it all. that was annoying
[2:35:50] nellfin: @nellfin you can't like it all that much if you don't know it never left
[2:35:52] yifors: what are we looking at Looking
[2:35:55] roookai: good loot is easier to come by now
[2:35:55] SVT_Dexter: rip rune of reorigination
[2:35:56] sleepinsane: just use missives
[2:35:58] luxumbra69: aka all melee
[2:36:00] Benjg7: youd just sim it now though
[2:36:01] OldPplGaming: and lazy ppl
[2:36:02] antipheonixna: id be down with reforging if they improved stats in general, they are so shit
[2:36:02] adardrae: ferals reforging for rune
[2:36:04] thenateo2: reforging wouldnt be very interesting now, raidbots would just do everything for you
[2:36:04] Basic_3: @Rhemax18 It's like doing that 2x. Oh boy, making a shitty thing shittier
[2:36:06] gnarlyshark: you dont know that
[2:36:06] planooooooooooooooooooooo: rune of reorigination reforging sessions after every single upgrade as a feral @Maximum PepeLaugh
[2:36:08] MrAndersen_: Kreygasm
[2:36:08] JackOfAllApocalypses: enhance shaman 8(
[2:36:10] Clarius: haste caps also doesnt exsist anymore
[2:36:10] Korupcija_: enchanting system from diablo 4 would be cool
[2:36:12] smolderdaddyuwu: aww that trinket <3
[2:36:16] kj01a: heck yeah spreadsheets!
[2:36:22] Kryous: I just used an addon because Hit Rating was a thing. Thank god that's gone.
[2:36:23] CoffeeASAP: garf Looking
[2:36:27] YdenTV: Bring back reforging, but with a caveat that you can reforge some of your secondary stat to a tertiary stat.
[2:36:41] srze94: ilvl is too strong now so +10 would be better anyway you would just have more fun reforging into a stat u actually need
[2:36:42] wraghelm: if I get haste on my WW that’s going right in the cooker
[2:36:54] surpriseparty20: Too many spread sheets IRL to care about in-game shit LUL
[2:36:58] StantonSC: reforge to +speed?
[2:37:00] planooooooooooooooooooooo: bullshit reasoning
[2:37:05] CladeusXE: titanforging in legion was way to broken i got 50 + ilvl off a wq
[2:37:12] Subbed_No_Ban: “multiple hoops”
[2:37:18] Subbed_No_Ban: go town push button
[2:37:19] Crucaider: Main stat has to be so valuable for every spec for that to be a thing
[2:37:24] Theliahh: running sims for every possible combination of every secondary on every piece of gear whenever you get an upgrade PepeLaugh
[2:37:30] zeitgeiz: arcano crystal
[2:37:34] Rhemax18: reforging is way more intuitive than having to sim every piece of gear
[2:37:35] antipheonixna: stats and gear honestly suck in wow rn very dull, systems need overall imo
[2:37:45] athenee: until legion it was just bis second stat (rings/necks no mainstat hughe stats sticks) and then the arcano crytal was there XD
[2:37:58] GeorGiimO: also for haste softcaps and stuff
[2:38:01] Hinzir: @Theliahh it was just a single button hit, dont talk like it takes hours haha :D
[2:38:02] planooooooooooooooooooooo: YEP
[2:38:07] Korupcija_: gear is so boring
[2:38:08] srze94: it wouldnt be necessary now, u just get more of a stat that makes your gameplay better
[2:38:11] antipheonixna: like who even knows anything about their current stats rn
[2:38:15] Miril9: catalyst too + more relevant drops from other sources
[2:38:15] YdenTV: Make it where you can add tertiaries
[2:38:18] DankWizard420: ..yeah for 2 items KEKW
[2:38:19] Kryous: Now-a-days, you'd just set your secondaries to what you want. You wouldn't need to sim at all.
[2:38:27] Throckytv: after you run 200 17+ keys
[2:38:38] Subbed_No_Ban: @ydentv yooo true
[2:38:43] JohnnyMcCrit: Max, come on, this is way to much Ads. Like I watch 10 Min. and get everytime 8 Ads @maximum
[2:38:44] luxumbra69: top players still dont follow sims anyways so it's kinda useless in many cases.
[2:38:47] nightst314: what kind of nightmare scenario is the guy cooking up?
[2:38:56] baseboned: i don't know how enjoyed it was, it just fixed an issue with 12 different stats in the game
[2:39:00] JERAULT: we? whos we?
[2:39:04] Uutef: he mentioned bonus loot during personal loot
[2:39:04] dellinia: @JohnnyMcCrit Get adblocker lmao
[2:39:08] footypjs: he mentioned bonus rolls too
[2:39:08] JERAULT: chat got like 5, you got 2
[2:39:11] StantonSC: i'm gold poor, can i reforge invulnerable?
[2:39:11] reymargera: HAH 3/10
[2:39:12] devz_5: bonus rolls were touched on in personal loot part right?
[2:39:13] f9ftw: but the crafting gear can't be more than or like the mythic gear
[2:39:14] drazzil7: Bonus rolls where in the personal loot tab so technically we got a 2in1 on that one
[2:39:15] Korupcija_: bring AP Pog
[2:39:17] nellfin: why is archeology on the list? it's still a thing
[2:39:22] CritzGG: He did'
[2:39:26] d0mezg4mer: the premise of the video isnt "bring ALLthese back"
[2:39:29] OrganicJKW: Part of personal loot.
[2:39:32] Rhemax18: it was part of personal loot
[2:39:32] DunzoCD: he lumped it with personal loot
[2:39:33] athenee: i want  bonus loot back tbh higher chance to get an item you rly want from that one boss like trinkets etc
[2:39:38] antipheonixna: seems to me the solution is make new systems instead of bring back old ones, weak vid imo
[2:39:38] OspreyRed: @nellfin they have not done anything with it since bfa
[2:39:41] ShowDUH: @nellfin Cause it's been abandonned
[2:39:41] surpriseparty20: Bring back covenant talent trees KEKW
[2:39:52] Swiftnexx: Suplised
[2:39:56] planooooooooooooooooooooo: glyphs were fucking sick
[2:39:58] VaToXeD: 10man mythic would be just solve some guilds problems
[2:39:58] nellfin: @ShowDUH you can't bring it back if it never left tho
[2:40:02] Jacksprat47: just give us a vault slot you can lock to a specific dungeon/boss/slot
[2:40:04] delacourtv: Let me grip myself to somebody
[2:40:06] Drows95: nah
[2:40:08] CoffeeASAP: cosmetic glyphs yes
[2:40:13] DankWizard420: cata glyphs were nice, with trails of fire
[2:40:14] Crucaider: Glyphs are still present, just not used
[2:40:22] keleksbreath: brawlers guild #1 in my heart
[2:40:30] Korupcija_: 10 man Prayge
[2:40:35] luxumbra69: @Crucaider cosmetic glyphs are used by almsot everyone still
[2:40:38] DanteDemonZ: i want the mage tower back
[2:40:38] MeisterChiefX: im really surprised brawlers guild wasnt here
[2:40:41] baseboned: i dont think so, I've never heard anyone cry for glyphs back
[2:40:46] grounder71: 10 mans would be sick
[2:40:47] ahri_feet_connoisseur: Clap
[2:40:50] Toketems: @maximum I came in late did u already talk about that heater of a game last night?
[2:40:51] DecayingPopcorn: People aren't wanting cosmetic glyphs specifically?
[2:40:52] ahri_feet_connoisseur: Clap2
[2:40:54] CoffeeASAP: we suck Sadge
[2:40:55] DankWizard420: was resilience on there?
[2:40:56] ahri_feet_connoisseur: Clap Clap2
[2:40:58] swagggle: earlier you said you would be happy if you got 3 right
[2:41:16] Jacksprat47: fuck actual glyphs make those good talents instead of the passive stats
[2:41:16] Baskkov: you have to be
[2:41:18] MagmaScythe: happier :)
[2:41:19] Altayir: I want the vengeance from MoP tanks back
[2:41:34] Hinzir: if they dont bring borrowed power and remove weekly cap from professions i think game will loose more ppl than it expects. Solo progressions totally  got ruined in DF. Cant even change and farm professions  when you want
[2:41:38] Clarius: its just essences
[2:41:39] MagmaScythe: They can in classic soon
[2:41:46] Korupcija_: BatChest so cool BatChest
[2:41:46] grobb12: its just SOD
[2:41:52] realtygra: no pls no
[2:41:54] DankWizard420: @MagmaScythe already can in wrath
[2:41:55] darkness79317: glyphs were kinda awful when they first came out
[2:42:01] DunzoCD: its just talent points lol
[2:42:04] VaToXeD: @Maximum I0 mans would be insane bro. Just because are a lot of guilds without players to play...
[2:42:07] amperegames: average sod player
[2:42:10] gammerinno: need a ping pong racket transmog I can use on jackiegamm (orc monk)
[2:42:11] ICitizenErasedI: i miss the one minor glyph that let my rogue walk on water while sprinting :p
[2:42:12] DankWizard420: the cosmetic glyphs were cool like fire charge for warriors YEP
[2:42:15] Icycutes: glyphs were embellishments but with class fantasy
[2:42:17] Clarius: LUL
[2:42:17] grounder71: sod is dogshit
[2:42:19] MeisterChiefX: true
[2:42:22] CoffeeASAP: lol
[2:42:27] CladeusXE: its a testing thing
[2:42:27] grobb12: baseg
[2:42:28] KaisenSiru: KEKW
[2:42:28] fizzleqt: RAGEY changes
[2:42:28] pailos04: sod is just a test run for retail its all coming soon lol
[2:42:28] CoffeeASAP: big mad
[2:42:29] Boreall: I played first phase of SoD and have come to the concluson it's cope
[2:42:29] planooooooooooooooooooooo: @Hinzir the trick is to immediately level everything, all your alts and all the professions from week 1, thereby x10'ing player engagement and sales figures
[2:42:31] Korupcija_: they ruined it for sure
[2:42:31] anfurrax: @ICitizenErasedI This is literally the only thing I remember glyphs doing
[2:42:31] wpprrz: I mean just do it right the first time.
[2:42:34] tastytictacs: i love sod, lol
[2:42:35] jskrizzle: Kappa
[2:42:36] adardrae: say that when a starsurge one shots you
[2:42:37] Boreall: Playing a bad game in a new way is still a bad game
[2:42:47] MrCasual_: Thinks thats the point of the seasonal classic servers is for change while the reg servers are to preserve
[2:42:51] flem_wow: cannot wait for the youtube comments when that clip is posted to wowhighlights @Maximum
[2:42:52] enigmasvea: starsurge 1shotted anyone
[2:42:59] Gordiie: boomkins were one shotting everyone in pvp from max range
[2:42:59] DankWizard420: starsurge was doing 50% hp KEKW
[2:43:00] CladeusXE: and just for classic andies
[2:43:20] baseboned: shitting on classic doesn't make you cool, let people enjoy what they enjoy, no one will force you to play

[2:43:42] Zarroe: xdding
[2:43:43] Kryous: Amen
[2:43:45] roookai: baseg
[2:43:56] Korupcija_: well you made it on stream
[2:43:56] LPQR3: I think that what happened to wow is that lost its hard rpg factor, i know there is no easy answer for this but people datamining ruin part of it, as it is the gearing system, the relevance of rare, uncommon and epic gear doesnt exist, form a rpg perspective you should not be full epics
[2:44:00] swagggle: you need lessons from Fleks
[2:44:03] malnourish_: youre too well known for bait like that
[2:44:06] CladeusXE: retail and classic dont mix
[2:44:09] grobb12: firstGarf
[2:44:10] fizzleqt: Chatting
[2:44:12] Evan_Ralston: firstgarf
[2:44:18] Gamerhcp: firstgarf firstGarf
[2:44:22] Karkesis: firstGarf
[2:44:24] jjwallababy: firstGarf
[2:44:27] awesomeoohh: Boomer moment
[2:44:27] DankWizard420: sod is the attempted improvement on things, something M+ still hasnt had PepeLaugh
[2:44:28] SurelyBaked: based and true
[2:44:28] DunzoCD: firstGarf
[2:44:31] amperegames: what that guy said
[2:44:32] thenateo2: firstgarf
[2:44:34] JoaEUW: What a weird take
[2:44:34] jjwallababy: you could have all epics in classic wtf?
[2:44:36] enigmasvea: that dude just complaining to complain
[2:44:37] OspreyRed: firstGarf
[2:44:45] surpriseparty20: Only Fleks can shitpost with 100% accuracy
[2:44:49] ahri_feet_connoisseur: a good balance would be nice
[2:44:53] OspreyRed: Classic exists for people who want oldschool wow
[2:44:54] kyr_slowbro: Nobody is immersed in the wow world, it's just a competitve game.
[2:44:54] ICitizenErasedI: i think the thing with wow is that you can talk to 10 different people and get 10 different things they love or hate
[2:44:56] Jacksprat47: looking back to classic the rarity didn't change much, just people got less stupid
[2:44:58] planooooooooooooooooooooo: Chatting
[2:45:04] Hedonismbot777: lol what is lily doing?
[2:45:06] ZordiakZero: The RP part doesn't exist in the RPG outside of those weird communities
[2:45:09] OspreyRed: YEP
[2:45:16] VRVento: im enjoying going back and forth between them playind SoD like a diablo season
[2:45:17] antipheonixna: nah i think in general though gear needs to be made more fun, who cares about their stats or weapons or trinkets rn, they are all eh
[2:45:18] Jazzarus_: hear me out, I play SoD and retail, both are good, but retail is just better
[2:45:23] Gamerhcp: max did you ever notice that your poster fell off the wall
[2:45:26] JERAULT: she was runnin
[2:45:28] Hedonismbot777: aw :)
[2:45:39] OspreyRed: i understand lots of people like classic, i do not tho LUL
[2:45:39] Zarroe: that goes hard
[2:45:41] Gamerhcp: it fell in the last poddy-c episode
[2:45:45] zenkodac: i think people who immerse themselves in wows world dont tend to spend much time on twitch specially on particular competitive ones like this one
[2:45:50] sleepinsane: is there a monitor on your celing?
[2:45:56] Gamerhcp: yes
[2:45:57] Rhop: Yeah
[2:45:58] CladeusXE: but i love seeing those HC wow death clips
[2:45:59] Hedonismbot777: Yeah in the middle of Poddy C lol
[2:45:59] Benjg7: yes
[2:46:01] DunzoCD: yes
[2:46:05] smolderdaddyuwu: rip displate
[2:46:13] ODLBubs: Earthquake?
[2:46:14] zannuss: anyone got a time stamp for that
[2:46:17] Rhop: You look back confused a few minutes later but move on
[2:46:18] Jacksprat47: there's just *too much* gear. five different pairs of plate legs when you only want one cause of the stats sucks
[2:46:20] CondorWow: big poddyc enjoyer here
[2:46:26] awesomeoohh: does anyone that raids in liquid go hard in the transmog / mount farming game
[2:46:27] dango0n: I wear a murse
[2:46:28] Hedonismbot777: @zannuss 29:11
[2:46:29] roookai: if u could only grow a mustache would you?
[2:46:44] slowfetch: ive played since bc and dont give a shit about immersion
[2:46:47] zannuss: thanks
[2:46:48] ahri_feet_connoisseur: I think so yes
[2:46:49] Greenslather: People that want emersion should just load up moonguard real quick
[2:46:50] DankWizard420: but they havent YEP
[2:46:50] zenkodac: but if you look for lore stuff there still a ton of people getting into the game even a ton of new youtubers getting into the lore and the game
[2:46:57] CoffeeASAP: just old people
[2:46:59] VRVento: cant wait till servers mean nothing next exp
[2:46:59] ahri_feet_connoisseur: Imagine if there was a TBC 2.0 with a lot of new mechanics and content
[2:47:01] Evan_Ralston: SMOrc Death to the Alliance SMOrc
[2:47:11] dango0n: I wish they would fully abandon the factions
[2:47:12] ahri_feet_connoisseur: i guess thats kinda like legion
[2:47:13] ahri_feet_connoisseur: nvm
[2:47:16] roookai: rpgs back then had a lot of stuff that we would scream to be changed for QOL
[2:47:31] CondorWow: my wife made me a horde logo for my car thats about it lol
[2:47:31] antipheonixna: i mean ppl probably thought that, but then legion came out and everyone loved the whole game again just need good content @Maximum
[2:47:34] CladeusXE: they make wow 2 or end it after the worldsoul thing
[2:47:41] surpriseparty20: The community killed factions on their own lol . Meta gaming took over
[2:47:52] surpriseparty20: Which is inevitable btw
[2:47:53] ahri_feet_connoisseur: isn't that SoD in a way
[2:48:01] f9ftw: true
[2:48:02] baseboned: tbc 2.0 was wrath
[2:48:03] Karkesis: imagine warfronts in vanilla
[2:48:05] DunzoCD: if BfA and cata were swapped it would be viewed much better
[2:48:07] ZordiakZero: Horde vs Alliance doesn't exist and barely existed in BFA
[2:48:07] Hedonismbot777: Covenant choices
[2:48:08] roookai: as a orcs v humans boomer i agree
[2:48:21] MrAndersen_: yea bfa is a good expansion to classic
[2:48:25] ahri_feet_connoisseur: BFA 2.0 BASED
[2:48:28] burnunit_: SOD would have been goated if they would have found a way to add blood elves and dranei to the mix
[2:48:32] CoffeeASAP: and it happens somewhere off the mainland zones
[2:48:41] Rhop: Covenants Madge
[2:48:44] baseboned: they teamed up before wow even started, that happend in wcIII
[2:48:52] romdall1: If BFA was before SoO then it would've been a banger but the horde got smacked down already at that point
[2:48:52] Kryous: It also makes sense that as time goes on, two warring factions would unite against end of the world scenarios.
[2:48:52] zannuss: watching that thing fall off the wall and startle your dogs was kinda funny
[2:48:59] Linith_Heart: i said horde vs alliance is a dumb concept now before BFA and i was told to shut my mouth Sadge
[2:49:05] Boreall: They should  have done every WoW Xpac exactly the same but in reverse
[2:49:10] MoltanBTW: f the boomers
[2:49:15] antipheonixna: i mean you have to do it with care if ur doing it multiple times, have to break it down and build up to a faction war if u want to do it again and ppl would eat it up
[2:49:19] ahri_feet_connoisseur: I really like the implementation of aldor/scryer in tbc
[2:49:24] Sinergy_57: Feel like people say that shit but then they add it to main WoW and those same people still complain about it
[2:49:26] Nekz3: are you going to play last epoch?
[2:49:29] EvoAllNight: does max even have a wow account anymore or does he just talk
[2:49:34] CoffeeASAP: like we start of allies then go to war over time?
[2:49:39] ZordiakZero: Just make WoW 2 and start over again
[2:49:42] Jacksprat47: bfa shoulda been like 3 xpacs too tho
[2:49:42] zenkodac: we just worked together to many times and share to many goals to actually be on opposing sides after wrath and cata
[2:49:45] f9ftw: what do you think about hero talent ?
[2:49:54] ahri_feet_connoisseur: I mean they added talent trees and it was a universal W
[2:49:57] baseboned: @EvoAllNight what do you hope to accomplish with this message?
[2:50:09] Lirnril: metzen should dm d&d sessions at blizzcon for people who miss the hardcore rpg vibes
[2:50:12] burnunit_: i mean, reaching here, but why not, i dunno, make it so during time walking weeks, you can do all the old raids similar to Fated...
[2:50:16] ahri_feet_connoisseur: yeah but classic is old content Sadge
[2:50:16] Gorakk82: one is chills and a journey the other is try hard
[2:50:24] ArcaneSyntax: you guys ever just think about how blizzard invented transmog and now literally every RPG has transmog
[2:50:27] Korupcija_: ye, you can go buff people in SoD
[2:50:29] Boreall: Classic is dying pretty bad, over half of the players have quit over the last 2 months
[2:50:31] holla____: garf bla frag
[2:50:33] mainian: Can't wait for classic wod
[2:50:34] ChrisSalvii: there are like 5 different ways to play wow rn its wild
[2:50:38] nellfin: @burnunit_ you can tho? no?
[2:50:41] MeisterChiefX: theyre both tryhard lmao
[2:50:45] EvoAllNight: @baseboned an answer?
[2:50:47] Gorakk82: i love both
[2:50:56] Gorakk82: they are different though
[2:50:56] bengawow: @Gorakk82 classic is tryhard af
[2:50:59] ahri_feet_connoisseur: I think what we collectively want is to be 14 years old in high school again Aware
[2:51:05] Jazzarus_: an activity like m+ but only with bosses, no trash, that is an alternative to raiding, would be awesome.
[2:51:06] antipheonixna: @Maximum what specs need reworking going into war within and why is it frost dk
[2:51:11] d0mezg4mer: is teapot still playing s3?
[2:51:13] baseboned: classic has been dying since it started, wow has been dying since it started, it's seasonal, relax
[2:51:21] Kryous: #DeleteAug
[2:51:22] Lirnril: @Jazzarus_ i also want wow themed monster hunter
[2:51:26] emecci: @d0mezg4mer Yep hes doing title again
[2:51:31] emecci: And CE
[2:51:32] Korupcija_: people are burnt out and don't realize it
[2:51:34] zenkodac: yea, and for them the game is great
[2:51:35] CoffeeASAP: that's because in gw2 we dont get any content lol
[2:51:35] Mazmerized: Guild wars 2 is a game where everyone is sorta an Aug so is a bit more normalized for mr teapot i think
[2:51:36] Razdruid: I started in 2009 and still play now. I enjoy aspects of both. Covenants were an abomination to start. BFA to start and Legion to start were both terrible. M+ now is cool asf
[2:51:43] OspreyRed: support classes are normal in GW2
[2:51:47] reymargera: Classic Chat
[2:51:49] Gorakk82: @bengawow yes you are right but it much less needed
[2:51:50] surpriseparty20: People don't realise how many fuckin ppl just run around and collect shit with like 450 ilvl gear
[2:51:52] ArcaneSyntax: @Maximum i watched a youtuber watch all the wow cutscenes in order and he actually really enjoyed the wow story.
[2:52:01] zenkodac: we just been in the sauce to long and are overcooked
[2:52:05] Hedonismbot777: Bruh only 10 more years till Classic Shadowlands Pog
[2:52:11] JERAULT: in gw2 i played a spec that only cleared bebuffs from my allies and it kicked ass
[2:52:11] tastytictacs: i mythic raid in retail, world last mythic most tiers, love SoD and Hardcore. The mtx are so meaningless to me, but ive been playing like 14 years
[2:52:13] adardrae: don't you feel that it's missing something though?  not sure what but something?  maybe us being children is what's missing?
[2:52:26] Korupcija_: KEKW
[2:52:27] Squats3: rip
[2:52:27] father_tito: steve dasnoozer
[2:52:27] EnrikoSuave: Danoosey KEKW
[2:52:31] seventhseal_wow: played classic to wrath, came back for dragonflight, loving m+ actually so much fun, hit 3200
[2:52:32] maplelost: PRAISE BE
[2:52:33] MeisterChiefX: hes gone Pog
[2:52:35] OspreyRed: dasnooser
[2:52:35] ChrisSalvii: had a friend start up wow in BFA, already has like 600 mounts, some people just find a niche
[2:52:35] Littleearth: Aware
[2:52:36] CladeusXE: yes there are so many tmog and mount farmers
[2:52:39] Squats3: i mean
[2:52:39] S0upbeast: The most fun I have is just playing rats and doing like +10 to +18s
[2:52:39] zenkodac: ArcaneSyntax im almost sure we saw the same person, last stream he started paying wow
[2:52:41] burnunit_: @nellfin there's 1 raid you can do during timewalking
[2:52:47] ahri_feet_connoisseur: i meannnnn
[2:52:47] EnrikoSuave: they shat all over him for no reason
[2:52:47] zenkodac: playing*
[2:52:48] menzlo: Chat is doing it now
[2:52:52] Gorakk82: the blood moon is really good
[2:52:54] baseboned: unhinged
[2:52:57] d0mezg4mer: celebrating someone leaving a job is maidenless behaivor
[2:53:04] Razdruid: people always talk about LoL players being awful but then they need to read the wow posts on forums.
[2:53:11] ArcaneSyntax: @zenkodac yeah he's been really refreshing to watch
[2:53:17] Hillside_: TONS of people blame danuser for the problems with wow's current story, for better or worse
[2:53:26] PurpleKami: same as reddit hating ybara despite knowing literally nothing
[2:53:27] DunzoCD: ya the SL story was shit, but dude doesnt deserve to be hated on and lose his job
[2:53:28] Korupcija_: he left and they removed all systems KEKW
[2:53:34] maplelost: then no one noticed
[2:53:34] CladeusXE: d4 was worse
[2:53:35] Squats3: when you have a story that the player base as a whole has just HATED... i dont blame anyone for being happy that hes gone.  ofc you should have a bit of tact and not be like "fuck that guy im glad hes fired".. but..yeah
[2:53:37] nightst314: he had one big statement on twitter that was made at the perfectly wrong moment @Maximum
[2:53:38] iiamBaro: steve wrote shadowlands story lines and it subotaged the actual story, so i understand their frustation but they always take a step further
[2:53:41] ahri_feet_connoisseur: did shadowlands and dragonflight have a good story though LUL
[2:53:48] EnrikoSuave: Another wowhead article classic
[2:54:04] devz_5: Was he the shards dude?
[2:54:07] ArcaneSyntax: classic wowhead
[2:54:11] MeisterChiefX: they gotta get their clicks
[2:54:19] sleepinsane: dude works at RIOT now?
[2:54:33] CoffeeASAP: yup
[2:54:36] swagggle: I think it's a combination of everyone loving Chris Metzen coming back and most people disliking Steve Danuser's writing so many people were happy he left
[2:54:41] nightst314: preach also cast some shade on him because according to him Jeff thought the shard system was the equivalent to tier sets
[2:54:44] CladeusXE: but alot of wow layoffs were cs and art
[2:54:45] antipheonixna: classic big wowhead
[2:54:56] Lirnril: weren't people super happy when metzen left back in the day too?
[2:54:57] kellarXO: God I hate druids
[2:55:00] iiamBaro: @ahri_feet_connoisseur dragonflight story is actually decent.
[2:55:01] sleepinsane: If he works at riot than that solidifies thier mmoRPG next year will be sick
[2:55:02] planooooooooooooooooooooo: you're gonna get weird people in anything you do, tbh
[2:55:04] N3llee: no one should be getting death threats or anything half that crazy thats for damn sure
[2:55:20] ahri_feet_connoisseur: @iiamBaro the final cutscene LUL
[2:55:21] planooooooooooooooooooooo: can't judge the whole community by its most toxic ambassadors
[2:55:23] father_tito: Its fair to criticize, not harass.
[2:55:35] Theliahh: @pjs_banana Madge
[2:55:36] zebracak35: Laura bailey 's new born son got deaththreats because of her role on TLOU2
[2:55:37] DunzoCD: tbh people forget metzen wrote cata and some of the stories that get alot of hate as well
[2:55:40] CoffeeASAP: the weekly no leaver commenters
[2:55:40] JERAULT: LMFAO
[2:55:42] holla____: xdd
[2:55:43] Theliahh: LMAOOOOO
[2:55:49] Squats3: grade A ban
[2:55:50] maplelost: we gonna go from disneyfied to full on teletubbies
[2:55:50] zenkodac: people overreact to steve danuser writing too much, the presentation is far from the best but the writing was never that bad
[2:55:53] Jjmn12: man Laura Bailey talking about that in the documentary is so sad
[2:55:56] zebracak35: not to her, her NEWBORN SON
[2:55:56] devz_5: to the baby too
[2:55:57] Karkesis: that was Jaina's voice actor too
[2:56:03] Elseworldz: They did that to the Brigitte VA in Overwatch too. Ridiculous.
[2:56:03] lynxie26: whoever sent death threats to laura bailey is an actual idiot
[2:56:04] S0upbeast: Unhinged behavior
[2:56:04] menzlo: Anti social behavior
[2:56:05] PJs_Banana: xD
[2:56:08] CoffeeASAP: that ban LOL
[2:56:08] CladeusXE: swatting and threats are to much
[2:56:10] Hedonismbot777: Same thing happened when they changed the face of MJ in that spider-man game series
[2:56:13] ArcaneSyntax: capital G Gamers
[2:56:26] fjord3: this type of behavior is not limited to gamers
[2:56:29] honeychonker: Not just video gamers, there were people in the Uk who sent death threats to a bad guy in one of our Soaps
[2:56:32] ishhimself: ishhimself subscribed with Prime. 
[2:56:42] Jacksprat47: there's sometimes legitimate criticism but way too often it's drowned out by a cesspool
[2:56:51] Squats3: hes very quiet.
[2:56:54] zenkodac: dude people use to hate on him so much for jesus thrall
[2:56:58] zenkodac: used*
[2:57:02] burnunit_: yeah but he was going through stuff in his personal live during cata and that influenced the story alot
[2:57:10] ahri_feet_connoisseur: he basically created warcraft
[2:57:12] Caelusgosu: @zenkodac YEP people hated Green Jesus
[2:57:13] Korupcija_: I don't care about story, just cool moments, and DF had none
[2:57:14] Hedonismbot777: Metzen just put every attribute point into charisma.
[2:57:16] ArcaneSyntax: @Maximum most people have no idea what each individual person actually does on the wow team.
[2:57:17] fjord3: also people who act like "normal adults" in person can act differently while online and anonymous
[2:57:20] ahri_feet_connoisseur: if you see his old drawings he ltierally created the game
[2:57:26] baseboned: @Korupcija_ lol ok bud
[2:57:35] Gorakk82: they need to go back to the Alliance vs Horde story
[2:57:45] theDirtyon3: YEP
[2:57:57] smolderdaddyuwu: so THD?
[2:58:01] CoffeeASAP: Me :)
[2:58:04] baseboned: wut?

[2:58:58] BigTrout3: look up "the great internet fuckwad theory"
[2:58:58] CladeusXE: its like bipoler for gamers
[2:58:58] ahri_feet_connoisseur: he probably just plays League of Legends tbh LUL
[2:59:01] surpriseparty20: Some people just get steam off through gaming.
[2:59:04] zenkodac: which is why i respect ion a ton because as the one with the responsibility to be the face for so many things he gets so much undeserved hate from those mobs
[2:59:05] GirlNinja: lol
[2:59:10] BigTrout3: look up "the great internet fuckwad theory"

[2:59:31] Culver42: that theory
[2:59:52] Hedonismbot777: Ion is awesome.  Don't agree with him on everything but love the guy.

[3:00:00] planooooooooooooooooooooo: Susge
[3:00:00] iiamBaro: his recent blizzcon presentation was great ngl
[3:00:03] ArcaneSyntax: I once had a discussion with someone who legit thought Ion was a CIA operative that sent people to gitmo
[3:00:05] Deatheran: @Maximum something about league would bring about the most awfull toxic part of me best descision i made was to quit when i realised how toxic i was. and do a 9 to 5
[3:00:07] Kayjin1223: Anonymity leads to some weird shit.
[3:00:14] MrPhelan: it's also somewhat corporate politics right? He can't just say what he wants.
[3:00:16] dubiusdingus: I really like Ion. the only time he did something I didn't like was when he said they didn't want people playing demo in wod
[3:00:19] OldPplGaming: For sure he gets WoW
[3:00:19] N3llee: thats a great statement about people at blizz having confidence in him. Never thought about it in that way
[3:00:22] poppapump: hi maxxy
[3:00:25] Squats3: never use your real name in your socials
[3:00:28] mcphatty: got that smooth jazz going on, Max is trying to seduce us
[3:00:33] KillUAssie: you going to stream mdi?
[3:00:33] CoffeeASAP: I feel like all the big issues I have had with wow started when he took over, but idk how much of that was actually him
[3:00:35] Lirnril: maybe blizzard was right trying to make us use real names in WoW like fifteen years ago
[3:00:48] planooooooooooooooooooooo: PepeLaugh
[3:00:56] portleys: that guy is me
[3:01:01] Hedonismbot777: I feel like people don't give Ion enough credit for his sense of humor either, he's really funny.
[3:01:06] Razdruid: Idk man. Considering the absolute shit show that a lot of wow has been until recent times where they almost completely ignored the community for years of which he is the head of? I can't ever honestly say I like him.
[3:01:12] CladeusXE: anyone listen to a vanilla wow vent of this 12y old trash talking
[3:01:13] planooooooooooooooooooooo: there's tiny little throwaway expressions like saying "it's done, go next"

[3:01:19] PJs_Banana: its usually 1pm east

[3:01:34] Caelusgosu: @hedonismbot777 true he also really good at rolling with the punches from the players

[3:02:56] xSavageALx: favorite caster class in wow?
[3:02:58] Boreall: Guys please he's allowed to have a bad take once in a while. At least he doesn't prefer gummy bears over gummy worms
[3:02:59] Joetrus: chili toppers need a refund on taste buds
[3:02:59] zannuss: Sonic would not be pleased with that take
[3:03:31] Squats3: @urakforce following for over a year.. never chatted.. Max says he doesnt like chilli on a dog and this guy just had to chat

[3:06:15] mr_jimbone: monkaS
[3:06:17] misran: that's a megaton of stops required
[3:06:17] Razdruid: all the way right into rezan
[3:06:19] JackOfAllApocalypses: that's insane....too many casters
[3:06:20] Razdruid: not left
[3:06:24] enigmasvea: ***
[3:06:25] enigmasvea: lol
[3:06:29] Keppie__: nah its doable for sure
[3:06:30] Kayjin1223: Too many interrupts for all at once I bet.
[3:06:33] Juicewolff: they don’t cast if in melee with tank
[3:06:39] DuckHS: DuckHS subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 7 months! 
[3:06:52] portleys: left three, stealthie to the right, tripple saurid pack and 2 birds into rezan
[3:06:55] Woussy: no
[3:06:58] battlenetq: bro i just got adds in the best part like wtf
[3:07:02] Woussy: She dont reset here
[3:07:07] Razdruid: too much ground fire

[3:07:41] santalylth: you guys took'
[3:08:06] Woussy: then you pull 2 left side
[3:08:19] KillchainGames: @Maximum ive only gotten into M+ progressively throughout DF .... thoughts on once you have every +20 portal you get an omni keystone that allows you to set any key level in any dungeon to practise and  push any key any level etc for IO?
[3:08:20] menzlo: What healer
[3:08:43] Denekyy: bold of you to assume there is gonna be a healer
[3:09:06] planooooooooooooooooooooo: surely there's some LoS tech
[3:09:22] Razdruid: G 27, G28, G30, G33, G34 and 2 saurid packs into rezan, first pull
[3:09:26] Keppie__: Thats the fun bit
[3:09:37] menzlo: Resan into priest
[3:09:38] misran: there's a safe spot at the base of priestess ramp, there'll prob be a giga saurid pull there
[3:09:41] Arisolo: @maximum it’s a 4 pull dungeon. everything is on top of bosses
[3:10:00] Razdruid: you can skip it
[3:10:01] Hikerguy74: nothing about that seems fun
[3:10:23] planooooooooooooooooooooo: @Maximum i've got it, you do the bosses + some count first, then you leave the biggest chunk of % for when the yazma stairs are loading
[3:10:25] smev1s: That's not happening
[3:10:39] Keppie__: Maybe you need evoker in this?
[3:10:43] Arisolo: @maximum you fear sigil and meld the left side and pull big pack into Alunza plus bottom stuff from the lava area
[3:10:44] f9ftw: btw evoker have mass for raging
[3:10:56] planooooooooooooooooooooo: 🇨🇰
[3:11:06] Flipeled: pres evoker does nice damage
[3:11:31] f9ftw: could we see melee dps ?
[3:11:46] Baskkov: all mobs in dht kinda die at the same time

[3:11:54] DanteDemonZ: did we find out about the secret murozond routes from time trials yet?
[3:11:59] Future_Faded: All 4 blighted dragons at once?
[3:12:04] Razdruid: I don't think you live without a healer on second boss
[3:12:06] Woussy: Yep
[3:12:15] Denekyy: probably like 6 pulls total
[3:12:17] Faraday5001: im interested to see how they pull 2nd room
[3:12:19] planooooooooooooooooooooo: yes
[3:12:20] nellfin: yes
[3:12:20] smev1s: No lol
[3:12:23] javybavy: easily
[3:12:28] kryptisgg: 100%
[3:12:30] elefnot: lol ennervates

[3:12:31] sheckles: with an md you can for sure
[3:12:35] Razdruid: yes because everything there is CC able
[3:12:53] biglonelytv: doggo
[3:12:54] Rugburn__: all leeches on boss
[3:13:04] sheckles: its not about cc the mobs its about living the dogs putting bloom on full party

[3:14:00] se_enginheiro: Or pull to boss last pack
[3:14:07] Rugburn__: F
[3:14:09] sheckles: @elefnot you wont see unholy dk
[3:14:14] nellfin: last pack on boss
[3:14:17] Keppie__: nah you need to activate last boss rp anyways
[3:14:20] Denekyy: they are probably skipping a drake and pulling last pack into last boss then
[3:14:32] Keppie__: so you atleast do the last pack on the last boss
[3:14:35] Flipeled: @Maximum skip to last pack to kill during RP
[3:14:49] nellfin: sleepwalk a mob onto last boss
[3:15:05] planooooooooooooooooooooo: what about skipping the first big pull or breaking it up, in favor for a big last pull into galakrond
[3:15:33] Keppie__: This seems so ez except for 2nd boss room
[3:16:06] nellfin: @Keppie__ it's tyran tho so it's kinda nothing
[3:16:11] Arisolo: fall is too linear but it’s full of prio where echo usually stomps
[3:16:26] javybavy: im curious what tech they are going to use for these dungeons, doesnt really seem like there is many options
[3:16:26] Baskkov: can you mass dispel
[3:16:28] Faraday5001: so many debuffs
[3:16:46] menzlo: Disc and shadow
[3:16:46] misran: it'll be fire mage shadow priest so giga prio
[3:17:03] javybavy: throne? just focus ravengers LUL

[3:18:08] sheckles: unleash the beast WideTHD
[3:18:10] Denekyy: u skip some packs in that room so u take them with 2nd boss
[3:18:27] Razdruid: wait what dungeon is bolstering on?
[3:18:41] smolderdaddyuwu: EB?
[3:18:52] business_man_alex: for sure you can
[3:18:53] deloxdd: that's nasty
[3:18:57] mojar88: nah the pull ins
[3:18:58] Suwah84: no way lol
[3:19:00] Lindorn_: quad pulls?
[3:19:03] Razdruid: super easy yes
[3:19:04] mojar88: will wreck your uptime
[3:19:04] PolishBunny: The mobs that pull you in? 4 of them? No u can't
[3:19:06] mojar88: zero chance
[3:19:06] se_enginheiro: Nah too many variables i guess
[3:19:06] business_man_alex: its 23 tyran
[3:19:18] business_man_alex: oh fuck
[3:19:27] RememberLeon: you have to chain pull them correctly to line up the pulls
[3:19:27] business_man_alex: you just focus the pull in bois as you run by
[3:19:28] PolishBunny: absolutely not gonna happen with mobs that pull you in 4 times.
[3:19:34] smolderdaddyuwu: @Razdruid ohh DHT has bolstering if you missed that glance
[3:19:35] deloxdd: u skip 1 pack on left or right
[3:19:37] Milky_MTV: twitch chat always right
[3:19:49] aramhere: hello from iran
[3:19:52] business_man_alex: you just time your pulls on the right side to get pull ins all at the same time
[3:19:57] asd123qwerty1: Full dwarfs and md ez pull
[3:20:00] kryptisgg: priest mind soothe goblin pack
[3:20:01] Throckytv: i think you can skip one of hte packs on the second boss
[3:20:13] Throckytv: you can't pull extra stuff onto that guy
[3:20:21] deloxdd: gates closed till they die
[3:20:23] fizzleqt: they have to die
[3:20:24] Razdruid: gate wont open
[3:20:27] rhithmx: skip the side packs in second boss room
[3:20:28] garkovankovic: arent 4 watchers at the same time too annoying because of their pulls?
[3:20:30] Ephires: u have to do all elementals cant skip em
[3:20:34] RememberLeon: is mdt over? I am a big fan of mdt and tgp but never get to watch because Wow doesn’t advertise their crap and YouTube livestream is never going to recommend live content
[3:21:00] Throckytv: the two guys at the end are gatekeepers to last boss im pretty sure
[3:21:00] garkovankovic: arent 4 watchers at the same time too annoying because of their pulls?
[3:21:03] aramhere: maximumHelpme
[3:21:07] smolderdaddyuwu: mdi starts this weekend
[3:21:10] SamMFJackson: @RememberLeon it starts friday
[3:21:15] SSnut1248: maybe grab the dudes behind totem boss to skip something on left
[3:21:25] Throckytv: though it might be that you can shroud to the end, kill the two mobs and then grab more trash onto the alst boss
[3:21:29] RememberLeon: @garkovankovic you can sync the pulls from the watchers so you basically only get pulled once
[3:21:43] Throckytv: are the big slimes detectors?
[3:21:53] Throckytv: mass invis
[3:21:54] Throckytv: idk
[3:21:56] awesomeoohh: really i thought rogue was like meta
[3:21:57] Throckytv: there could be tech tehre
[3:22:01] business_man_alex: do you have guesses on what you think the comp will be?
[3:22:02] awesomeoohh: oh maybe not bc aoe cap
[3:22:05] Phil_MacAvity: meeres was logged onto a rogue on tourny realm
[3:22:06] f9ftw: no
[3:22:06] smolderdaddyuwu: not anymore :(
[3:22:08] Kripttyk: what do you think the comps would be?
[3:22:09] f9ftw: they don't
[3:22:11] PolishBunny: since SL they dont get bolster.
[3:22:17] planooooooooooooooooooooo: they might snap the upper floors somehow into the bosses PepeLaugh
[3:22:21] So_0bvious: EB sanguine
[3:22:25] Denekyy: they ar erunning mage sp for sure in each comp
[3:22:29] smolderdaddyuwu: back in my day! oldge

[3:23:25] dorki: wcm is impossible
[3:23:26] Vaynehelsing_: smallies bolster tho, giga scarry
[3:23:26] Flipeled: VDH will just parry every melee anyway
[3:23:30] dorki: its a w route
[3:23:36] planooooooooooooooooooooo: maybe there's some kiting tech that allows matron to be bolstered to let's say 25 stacks "safely"
[3:23:41] Benjg7: NOTED
[3:23:45] Clush___: unfun is blizzard's motto buddy'
[3:23:51] twinkieruler95: @Maximum What did you think of the bowl yesterday
[3:23:53] Clush___: d4 exists

[3:24:23] garkovankovic: @Maximum oh yeah the superbowl was nice
[3:24:27] nezo_pont: Is mdi fort or tyrannical?
