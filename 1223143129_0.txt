[0:36:45] magiccanvashands: a lot of people are crying because the pvp'rs are pushing out into the warld zones and just destroying people
[0:36:45] diabl712: you can buy the gear now
[0:36:51] Enmael00: i guess this is the part where we say.. i toldyou so to level up ASAP to get fast ranks
[0:37:54] Gizimoo86: Also i know why everyone is doing only AV no WSG/AB. It gives most honor but you cant make premades for it so people dont want to fight premades in AB/WSG
[0:38:01] magiccanvashands: gnome warriors are op as hell
[0:38:04] dudatron: duuuddddddeeee those are some long hours

[0:42:39] Gizimoo86: not that special
[0:42:43] rbubbaray: but most always had raid gear which works in pvp.. right
[0:42:44] dudatron: I mean, it's not classic experiece the moment SoM was announced right?
[0:42:57] Enmael00: they are not aiming for the classic experience... som devs are just throwing anything on the wall and see what sticks
[0:43:09] eshonxyz: its not like it was a surprise, blizz literally said we'd rank twice as fast, blows my mind ppl are getting schocked now
[0:43:17] magiccanvashands: @swifty it's going to be a warzone everywhere and the parse competition is going to be insane this go around.

[0:43:59] IncinerateGaming: High guys FeelsGoodMan
[0:44:16] Gizimoo86: Oh unstoppabled force costs 125g from vendor monkaS
[0:44:19] eshonxyz: transmog for the 3 gear sets in hte game lol?
[0:44:20] mformack28: whats transmog

[0:44:56] nomourn9000: you're gonna play a third time then? xD
[0:44:59] eshonxyz: in classic being able to see your opponents actual gear is a thing transmog ruins that
[0:45:01] Chosey: did you lose a rank?
[0:45:03] danionlive: its litterally the BEST thing they have EVER added to the game
[0:45:07] danionlive: Transmog is lietterally the best
[0:45:30] eshonxyz: @danionlive in retail, it has no place in classic, play dress up barbie doll somewhere else
[0:45:34] dudatron: agreed
[0:45:37] rbubbaray: im so behind
[0:45:49] enigmaticc1: How? Theres no incentive to farm hard content for gear that rewards grinding and sweat
[0:45:52] enigmaticc1: Its instant reward
[0:45:55] nejuzasnejsi: any new youtube vids coming up?
[0:46:00] ShortLordTV: @eshonxyz LUL true

[0:50:55] Jcres54: its still suuuper slow tho
[0:51:09] MartianPK: lvling is FAR too long
[0:51:19] Trey_Dizzle45: especially if you play causally it takes forever
[0:51:21] leppin_: wowhead says this is a 12 month server, is that true or is it ending at end of this year like you said earlier?

[2:58:58] harris243124: Alliance baby!
[2:58:58] Zicero47: I have a theory. Alliance "sucked before". But they have instant queue, so what if they lose, they can just lose fast and get honor fast. Its the exact same way for horde now. Horde doesnt suck, they just give up because its fast honor.
[2:58:59] upperpizzapie90: yeah not a fan of this AV type.

[7:40:25] Chosey: NEIN
[7:40:26] cvrogers17: The only thing in FF14 that is grindy is the story. You have to level and go through the main story quests in order to unlock dungeons and raids. Besides that the game is way less grindy than other MMOs. Even WoW. You only need one character, and it has access to all professions and classes. You level them individually and can swap between classes on the fly.
[7:40:32] ThatManDill: lol
[7:40:37] TwistedBB: Let's say you were given the option to get a lifetime sub to wow for 500 bucks. Would you have bought it @Swifty ?
