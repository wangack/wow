[5:42:10] M4rcelino34: @DrProfSgtMrJ i think if they made it so that with evey q evolution he got 25 extra q range then he would be pretty good because the damage is very godo but the point and click makes you have to walk fight up rather than it being e skill shot people can walk into if you are ecaping

[5:42:52] radimier: @M4rcelino34 maybe if the first 1 gave 50 range and the next two gave 25
[5:42:55] SpilledBread: not a champ until 225
[5:42:57] hrambling: Winged Rat fun?
[5:43:03] flibbernoodle: a teesny bit of damage
[5:43:05] Loquial: @M4rcelino34 range increases are massive buffs tho, feel like they might just reduce stacks needed first

[6:09:08] wagrief: The chat buzzes with excitement as viewers eagerly tune in, curious about how Sneaky would speedrun yet another story game. But as the stream goes on, something feels off. Curiosity mingles with unease as the viewers watch the streamer start to wander around and not continue the main story, even though he is known among the community as "Main Quest Andy." Then suddenly, Sneaky starts a side quest. The chat explodes with confusion and panic, desperately seeking answers.
