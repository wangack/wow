I played the game a lot myself but you are still wrong in assuming that the install base increases the average skill. While its technically not wrong, but in the end its the active playerbase that evolves the meta/tricks etc which makes it more competetive

[13:54:11] Mack_Dagwood: The Game is a mental game where the objective is to avoid thinking about The Game itself. Thinking about The Game constitutes a loss, which must be announced each time it occurs. It is impossible to win most versions of The Game. Depending on the variation of The Game, the whole world, or all those aware of the game, are playing it all the time. Tactics have been developed to increase the number of people aware of The Game and thereby increase the number of losses.
