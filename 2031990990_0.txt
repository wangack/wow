[3:54:40] happyheals: I just tank on my dks.
[3:54:42] Requiem237: Ret arguably worst melee in the game right now so definitely not that one

[3:55:08] happyheals: it is justr for a pvp alt to have fun on
[3:55:23] sean_spelled_like_seen: ret is pretty fun
[3:55:29] sean_spelled_like_seen: very facerolly in bgs and such
[3:55:39] Requiem237: Ret is fun if you like being bad into everything meta right now

[3:56:11] sean_spelled_like_seen: LOL
[3:56:48] sean_spelled_like_seen: rets fun man, i love arms but it's not as fun to pop people with the current build of arms
[3:56:49] happyheals: just picking a toon to do a full heroic clear later or tomorrow
[3:56:59] Requiem237: our class tuning since S1 has consisted of “All damage increased 3%”
[3:57:40] skelexoxo: do u like doing keys

[3:59:18] sean_spelled_like_seen: i'm gonna miss probably most of next season on deployment so i know that feel
[3:59:27] Requiem237: Damn apparently I started an argument between Mes and Cdew. that’s what I get for thinking I was being helpful
[3:59:30] happyheals: Got out of Army in 2010 and have been doing my thing since then in the private sector
[4:00:03] happyheals: I spent 6 years in Afghanistan
[4:00:23] happyheals: and everywhere you could imagine not wanting to go
[4:00:28] happyheals: hehe
[4:01:09] happyheals: SATCOM Engineer/Network Engineer

[4:19:55] trollmasta66: @notmes which season of tier would you pick for unholy if you could choose?>
[4:19:57] Kendakilla: i just got back to playing retial today after 3 year break
[4:20:43] Imagine_TBH: Retail is good! lots to do, in the way you wanna do it
[4:21:11] healhut: did they finalize the next tier voting?
[4:22:04] Pwnyo808: trying to hit 1800 as MM is aids
[4:23:05] trollmasta66: @beep101boop not yet, one more day. It's clear which tiers will win because pve dominates the votes.
[4:43:40] americanmoses18: wut we doin now mes
[4:44:04] americanmoses18: do heroic up till smold for more tokens for u?
[4:44:48] dawsonator171: what is the quest everyone was talking about that allegedly increases drop chance?
[4:45:04] sean_spelled_like_seen: not a quest
[4:45:05] americanmoses18: theres a quest?
[4:45:09] Pwnyo808: SS can be so fun but also so tilting
[4:45:19] sean_spelled_like_seen: fyrakk drops an item you click on
[4:45:22] sean_spelled_like_seen: in ur inventory
[4:45:23] Pwnyo808: i was one win from 1800 as MM and now i tanked to 1700, LOL
[4:45:26] sean_spelled_like_seen: increases chance
[4:45:41] Pwnyo808: but it'
[4:45:59] dawsonator171: legendary wouldn't stop me from being shit, but it would make me look cool.
[4:46:20] americanmoses18: some could say daws would look like....hot shit
[4:47:58] MedtnerFangirl: I heard keys increase your chances at it (they don’t but also keys)
[4:48:32] dawsonator171: I have AD 18
[4:48:33] happyheals: started the warrior, doing a heroic raid now
[4:48:36] dawsonator171: which is easy as hell.
[4:48:39] americanmoses18: lets roll first 7 heroic and up ur chances more
[4:48:53] trollmasta66: you will start to have to have 5k verse in high keys
[4:48:55] happyheals: gonna go back on druid after raid
[4:49:01] trollmasta66: but ya legend is nice
[4:49:04] happyheals: wanna try to get rating up in arena
[4:49:21] Pwnyo808: you got any good tips for MM and how to get away from melee?
[4:49:32] Pwnyo808: cuz i feel like if i have a melee on the other team they're just inside of me all game
[4:49:45] sean_spelled_like_seen: Kreygasm
[4:50:36] happyheals: best way for mm to get away from melee is changing to bm
[4:51:27] Pwnyo808: i'm 2100 as BM so i don't wanna queue atm, LOL
[4:51:33] Pwnyo808: queues are too long and all i get is melee
[4:51:46] sean_spelled_like_seen: womp womp
[4:51:47] Pwnyo808: ss
[4:51:55] Pwnyo808: yeah so i'm playing as MM
[4:51:58] Pwnyo808: and it's caaaaancer
[4:52:13] trollmasta66: @Pwnyo808 max range mastery
[4:52:44] Pwnyo808: yeah
[4:52:53] Pwnyo808: in SS whenever i end up kiting my team just runs away from me
[4:52:58] happyheals: I just want to get a legendary so I can feel like I might be good
[4:53:38] al_capow: you ever think it would be cool if player corpses had a loot table in arena?
[4:53:44] al_capow: like arena only special drops
[4:53:49] happyheals: I bumped my druids key up to a 20 AD if you need it Mes
[4:54:13] dawsonator171: In pve?
[4:54:19] happyheals: but the orange color adds internal value as dps
[4:54:20] dawsonator171: I feel like none of them stack haste.
[4:54:23] sean_spelled_like_seen: I feel like the lego in keys is kinda whatever because of affixes. Standing still on the animation is pretty horrible
[4:54:47] dawsonator171: if i ended up getting it for pvp I'd move over to haste stack build for unholy.
[4:54:56] happyheals: they prob overtuned the others
[4:55:00] sunileif: what is it assa sub destro?
[4:55:27] manettidro: On global 3 second channel lol
[4:55:32] sean_spelled_like_seen: clunky + sometimes you just low roll and affixes go nuts
[4:55:49] sean_spelled_like_seen: can't really time it up with some of the random ground candy
[4:56:09] sean_spelled_like_seen: feel like Bele'ros or whatever is a better version of that though
[4:56:14] manettidro: The on use should be a bit better than it is
[4:56:25] sean_spelled_like_seen: you channel on the move, it explodes and extends some of your burst windows, and then you just move on with your rotation
[4:56:45] trollmasta66: are you talking about legend?
[4:57:03] trollmasta66: it has a 100% uptime on dot
[4:57:31] trollmasta66: the dot might be wroth it since it scales off verse
[4:57:39] trollmasta66: it's my 3-4th dadmage overall in keys
[4:58:19] sunileif: hpal leggo NODDERS
[4:58:55] sunileif: volc
[4:58:58] happyheals: they will be better because of orange

[11:39:34] happyheals: yeah
[11:39:41] nikthevoker: your core
[11:39:42] sunileif: nah its fine
[11:39:44] nikthevoker: is heated
[11:39:54] happyheals: you have a wind protected area with heat lamps
[11:39:58] sunileif: your chest is warm you be alright
[11:40:17] Requiem237: it’s 47 here and I still don’t wanna go outside
[11:40:20] happyheals: you make like a steamy almost psauna
[11:40:37] nikthevoker: if your core is heated youre good, enough heat to keep head going
[11:41:21] happyheals: then you deserve what you get
[11:41:26] sunileif: only if youre weak
[11:41:27] Requiem237: pretty sure you just shatter

[11:41:53] traav_p: a lot of ppl do sauna before icebath
[11:42:22] Requiem237: probably good odds for a heart attack
[11:42:22] sunileif: it wakes you up better than coffee?
[11:42:31] ZealotryTV: your body dumps adrenaline and you adapt
[11:42:33] Requiem237: just from the sheer shock to your body
[11:42:53] waitimdesyncd: @sunileif  anything life threatning wakes you up LUL
[11:43:04] eefybeef14: does anyone know where to find a good sub rogue build? just started learning one
[11:43:22] sunileif: idk if a sharp temp change was gonna deathable thered be alot more dead people
[11:43:23] primejusticegaming: Going from a normal or heated temperature to an extreme low temperature can throw your body into hypothermic shock. it can cause your heart rate to drastically drop
[11:43:24] Necrootide: @notmes depend on in you go completely under if you go under the ice water you will activate the divers reflex which slows the heart, basically putting your body into a form of shock

[11:44:58] sunileif: yes
[11:45:03] Requiem237: cessation of breathing sounds a tad unhealthy
[11:45:07] happyheals: sorry was afk
[11:45:11] sunileif: loss of limb is better than loss of life?
[11:45:17] happyheals: Hot to cold changes
[11:45:35] Necrootide: It's a reflex used to protect vital organs
[11:45:38] eefybeef14: does anyone know where to find a good sub rogue build? just started learning one
[11:46:00] sunileif: or you blood from thickening up too much
[11:46:00] happyheals: Hot water will send your blood oxygen to the organs
[11:46:12] ZealotryTV: vasoconstriction
[11:46:21] Necrootide: Vasocontriction
[11:46:31] Requiem237: reduce sizes of blood vessels
[11:46:32] happyheals: it is healthy if you do it properly

[11:47:20] Fueldx: human dk or gnome?
[11:48:47] johnnythunderbunny: yo
[11:48:54] Necrootide: The processes should be a slow exchange not immediate exposure or its just straight negative effects.
[11:49:01] happyheals: It may increase your resilience so I guess hot to cold baths worked well during WOTLK PVP
[11:49:43] Requiem237: funny enough my heart and breathing stopping is the same thing that happens to me when my Ret queues into a DH, Lock, Mage lobby in shuffle
[11:49:47] itsmistero: 14m dmg
[11:49:57] nikthevoker: sup johnny

[11:51:42] happyheals: no it is natural
[11:51:50] Requiem237: Stone form eggs

[11:58:07] Moobot: Join my Discord community! https://discord.gg/mes
[11:58:12] sunileif: why? rogue the only class that needs a nerf
[11:58:17] nikthevoker: i got you LUL
[11:58:38] sunileif: you gonna try blood?
[11:58:40] happyheals: pre nerf all other melee before nerfing sub so it doesn't affect them as much
[11:59:48] sunileif: nerf sub and assa down in line below aug
[12:01:17] Chillinar: delete rogues
[12:01:33] ZealotryTV: @johnnythunderbunny the leggo doesnt exist Sadge
[12:01:59] Chillinar: you need to harder @ZealotryTV
[12:02:22] nikthevoker: anyone ever order like sprinkles or wicked good,  is it actually worth? LUL random qustion
[12:02:27] indithedog: dommed
[12:02:30] ZealotryTV: come agane?
[12:02:46] happyheals: Dommed like in Fast and Furious
[12:02:58] JustTaki: What do you save shell for in the mirror
[12:03:46] happyheals: better to hold and never need it
[12:04:28] JustTaki: gotcha so predominantly when your healer gets ccd?
[12:04:32] samalycs: mes i just realised where is your other spells
[12:05:59] Solushun: in b4 the "does not apply to PvP"
[12:06:00] Stinelly87: Are you expecting more notes than what was released already for 10.2.5?
[12:06:34] pvalue01: anything for healers u think?
[12:06:53] Solushun: D:
[12:07:00] sunileif: mm buffs?
[12:07:02] traav_p: if dk gets a nerf they fix anything for survivability ?
[12:07:59] Chillinar: nah fuck rogues. nerf them to the ground
[12:08:12] ZealotryTV: ^
[12:08:13] happyheals: the problem is that resto druid gets these nerfs every expac and they don't fix it and resto remains weak for months
[12:08:16] ZealotryTV: and i dont even pvp anymore
[12:08:27] nikthevoker: buff devoker
[12:08:47] Solushun: https://imgflip.com/i/8cbdqw
[12:08:52] Dirkdigglier: You didnt like jungle with treants bashing?
[12:08:52] Solushun: this why i dont trust anything
[12:08:54] nikthevoker: stinky breath > treants
[12:08:54] Solushun: cuz that wasnt a troll
[12:08:57] Solushun: thats a legit bluepost
[12:08:58] happyheals: all they have to do is make the lifebloom 3 stack talent go down to 2 stacks
[12:09:14] happyheals: and scale down the grove guardian nourish
[12:09:20] Solushun: facts
[12:09:40] happyheals: but what they did last time was nerf the hell out of our mastery
[12:09:56] Dirkdigglier: I think we should buff druids, because i like to play them. But the devs never take that into consideration
[12:10:44] sunileif: nerf druids they just got a bunch of cosmetics
[12:10:57] sunileif: NODDERS
[12:11:24] ZealotryTV: NODDERS
[12:11:36] Dirkdigglier: I think it would be confusing to the average player if druds now look the coolest but arent the ebst
[12:12:27] ZealotryTV: the average player is playing BM or Havoc not druid
[12:12:37] sunileif: nah your xmog is like 15% of your dps
[12:12:51] Dirkdigglier: We should not nerf them either
[12:13:40] happyheals: I want to try a mana safe build that I spent some time thinking about on the toilet
[12:13:54] traav_p: you like the dot build over clawing shadows/pet?
[12:14:16] happyheals: I just worry that I should wait till im fully geared
[12:15:05] jporter_: just a geared a dk for the first time, absolutely loving it. been playing casters my whole wow career
[12:15:14] happyheals: other classes have better cds
[12:15:25] happyheals: like drs and stuff
[12:15:27] Requiem237: I think if every healer was as fun as RDruid and felt as strong that’d help SS queues too
[12:15:28] ZallKlos: how do you feel about verdant conduit + infurious boots at embellishmen?
[12:15:29] Dirkdigglier: priests should be able to summon neophytes who heal for them exactly like treants
[12:15:31] eMBeaR64oz: nerfing Druid and dk for when I start playing again, great 😊
[12:15:48] Requiem237: so it makes more sense to buff other healers before nerfing RDruid into the ground
[12:15:50] Machop36: Hey Mes it's Sunday! :)
[12:15:59] Vendrek: Lets just homogenize all healers!
[12:16:22] waitimdesyncd: I feel it in my loins. The classes I enjoy the most this season (evo and dk) will get tuned down, and sub rogues and fire mage will be buffed
[12:16:28] happyheals: nah it sucks in final fantasy pvp
[12:16:59] Vendrek: Kingsbane one shot
[12:17:15] happyheals: other classes have bop or spirit link or cocoon or power word barrier
[12:17:22] waitimdesyncd: what would he cold blood? the kingsbane?
[12:17:27] Solushun: i waited to long to come out no hots
[12:17:32] Solushun: was going to stun off his C
[12:17:33] Solushun: CC
[12:17:33] FlynnFluff: anyone in chat close to 1800 want to try adn get it with a ret?

[12:19:00] Solushun: or kidney
[12:19:09] ReplyCodeOmega: what a beatiful looking ui
[12:19:11] happyheals: he prob wanted to stun open
[12:19:40] Vendrek: Yes he can dance...but by the time that happens the rogue has use their trinket and is susceptable to CC
[12:19:52] happyheals: no i meant Sol wanted to stun maybe
[12:20:25] Vendrek: He should have stunned at 75%
[12:20:38] Vendrek: ye
[12:20:54] happyheals: he just couldn't find the Solushun for that problem
[12:21:28] Dirkdigglier: Sol been burned by too many rogue mage swaps
[12:21:35] Dirkdigglier: gun shy now
[12:21:57] Dirkdigglier: Redemption time bby

[12:32:30] sunileif: and a full run?
[12:33:00] sunileif: then force klink to carry us thru mythic
[12:33:12] nerdyorc_: the drop rate of this one seems lower than the evoker staff
[12:33:36] happyheals: I don't think an Arms Warrior has kille lasty boss on Mythic yet
