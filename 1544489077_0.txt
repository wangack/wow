[4:05:41] A_Cold_0ne: a skip to legion after a few years sure
[4:05:41] Sunglassestony: Maybe they have a new cata in the works, not as bad as the old cata LUL
[4:05:45] TheMemerous: 2400 is 278 conduits... so you could say its an upgrade
[4:05:48] randawg100: Mop is trash imo

[4:06:52] Sunglassestony: WHat did you make?
[4:07:22] SpinninBody: ya, but in pvp 2100 and 2400 are both 285 so it doesnt matter for pvp, only pve

[4:09:52] spidersrskary: they were talking about a double rogue rbg team
[4:10:09] WanderingFeral: @mr_presiden1 honestly most people I’ve talked to said they like Cata until LFR was introduced and they didn’t like the last raid
[4:10:20] robi_osk: bcuz it extend block duration
[4:10:41] WanderingFeral: @mr_presiden1 also I think Cata and MOP had some of the best PvP
[4:11:04] centurionmanfurion: extends SB? doesnt over write?
[4:11:40] dad_of_four: I think alot of people hated cata because they were so used to dungeons being faceroll and cata they were much more challenging and it caused people to be toxic since you had to know mechanics

[5:40:11] xprobutterrz: cash account or margin?
[5:40:15] PapaBeks: thats also how 99% of people lose everything, bc its not guessing lol
