[10:09:02] We_Are_Venomm_: what is the cost of the mount in sod at 40?
[10:09:04] LightBladeStream: No I disagree big time. Retail mechanics are highly visual, you can see whats going on
[10:09:05] newkingcody: thats why retail gets harder and harder
[10:09:07] Thoreya: nah, this is an asmon trash ass take that people dont wanna apply themselves. all they need is to get bigwigs and details

[10:12:38] veiloflonelystars: removing weak auras and making things more visible and better UI is the way to go
[10:12:38] Derken11: they should have a weakaura that forces them to target the other thing kek
[10:12:46] adbloccklol: @veiloflonelystars at least for the race to world first it would be interesting
[10:12:55] LightBladeStream: @pandreas no, because the quest helper does different things. Also, there is no way to know what zones are fastest ingame
[10:12:58] newkingcody: i hate the nameplates in classic
[10:12:59] Cecross: @pandreas no way, that addon shows you the perfect route to level

[10:14:47] andypandynz: @veiloflonelystars to make a weak aura u need to know the fucking mechanic and how to doit LUL stop hating the weak auras, they dont even have bigwig timers figured out

[10:14:55] subiettv: I wonder if they will make transmog like retail mog where we can mog our legendaries or will it be like cata tmog
[10:15:04] veiloflonelystars: @LightBladeStream weakauras are alot more than shoes on
[10:15:06] newkingcody: look cool = play good
[10:15:08] ChickenDipper123: i dont
[10:15:09] andypandynz: @veiloflonelystars u gotta stop thinking weak aura is a crutch
[10:15:19] minich4rmander: its very important in pvp

[10:15:42] newkingcody: @theorodrem5 yap
[10:15:46] caveman_ju: to each their own, transmog just add something else to do in this boring game
[10:15:49] theorodrem5: we aint playing wold of modecraft
[10:15:50] craboskai: @theorodrem5 Baseg true
[10:15:52] Austyz: should be a level requirement on xmog. level 10РђЎs in full raid gear xmog was always weird
[10:15:56] minich4rmander: transmog is for sims players
[10:15:56] suddenarthritis4: In classic I don't want xmog, in retail idgaf the game is a messy design
[10:15:56] Signa_arize: where's your ammo lil bro
[10:16:06] urmadlife: oh no Wa rant
[10:16:08] andypandynz: weak auras is one of the biggest downloaded addons in retail but people still cant clear all the raids LUL I WONDER WHY
[10:16:13] pandreas: transmog is for shit players
[10:16:18] adbloccklol: just make an option in interface to disable transmog for those who dont like it simple
[10:16:33] veiloflonelystars: EXACLY
[10:16:35] craboskai: weakauras ruined WoW ok
[10:16:38] veiloflonelystars: weak auras is like having wheels on
[10:16:40] LightBladeStream: There is nothing wrong with that
[10:16:40] Surahn: some retail mythic bosses you have to have a weakaura to kill it
[10:16:44] urmadlife: why wouId you want to remove others transmogs hehehe
[10:16:44] Bewts: Transmog is for christofascists HotPokket
[10:16:48] veiloflonelystars: without WA you have to actually think what ur doing
[10:16:51] neugassh: you need an addon that reminds you to turn on weakaura
[10:16:51] deepz: weakauras is for retail
[10:16:54] suddenarthritis4: Better to redesign how stats and gear works if you want transmog.
[10:17:04] gokmob: YEP
[10:17:11] newkingcody: the problem is, retail has been so over designed to the point where its not possible to track everything without WA
[10:17:11] GOSUBO_: weakauras just get rid of the tedious shit
[10:17:11] craboskai: that's what people actually used to do so yes :)

[10:17:14] Nikola_1019: i actually do :D
[10:17:17] veiloflonelystars: without WA players have to count their rotation on top of doing mechanics, tell me that doesn't take more skill than with weakauras
[10:17:19] andypandynz: @veiloflonelystars ah that makes sense. you think looking at a buff timer is hard so weak auras play thegame
[10:17:23] LightBladeStream: @veiloflonelystars you have to look at the bottom action bars and top right of the screen constantly. It's so dumb
[10:17:25] urmadlife: ShouId bIIizard desing the game around that instead of reIying on 3rds software hehehe
[10:17:28] uranus4head: hey handsome how are you
[10:17:29] p0tte: Feed ur pet dude
[10:17:32] haydoo61: mr orange
[10:17:33] newkingcody: the way they design the game now they expect players to have addons
[10:17:34] Nikola_1019: it is v ery inconvenient, i admit
[10:17:36] LightBladeStream: @LightBladeStream there is zero skill in that, just waste of time and effort
[10:17:36] urmadlife: hey handsome how are you

[10:18:24] teaxdxd: say totem timers 5 times
[10:18:27] urmadlife: The probIem is that BIIizard doesnt care about it Omegakek
[10:18:29] LightBladeStream: @veiloflonelystars how about we use brainpower on interesting things, instead of maintainance? Like thinking about positioning and mechanics
[10:18:31] veiloflonelystars: KEKW
[10:18:42] veiloflonelystars: i mean true but its part of the game

[10:19:00] Dnut: feed your dog :(
[10:19:02] veiloflonelystars: @LightBladeStream thats also a fair point, in my mind what they should do is make better UI and not rely on WA

[10:19:32] andypandynz: @veiloflonelystars bro im so lost u dont like the fact u can move the buff timers from top right to the middle?
[10:19:36] LightBladeStream: youre not going to do that anyways
[10:19:49] veiloflonelystars: retail playerbase will keep shrinking till it's no longer fisable for delopment as almost no new players want to try it
[10:20:03] andypandynz: oh veil is retail hater that makes senes
[10:20:05] nozonemazalaza: NOWAY
[10:20:05] urmadlife: Wa are bad cause peopIe force me to use them and im not smart enough weirdChamp
[10:20:06] minich4rmander: @Signa_arize thats just wrong. it really depends what kind of group of people your game focusses on
[10:20:15] veiloflonelystars: @andypandynz im talking of the more pro active weakauras, not really buff or debuff timers
[10:20:26] suddenarthritis4: Retail has been obviously slowly dying ever since vanilla
