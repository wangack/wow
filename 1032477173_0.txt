[1:32:44] I_DoctorSatan_I: Blizzard pushing Night Fae covenant for Hunters pretty hard. 76% of hunters (as per logs) are currently Night Fae. NF is getting a "buff" once again, while keep dangling that BiS covenant carrot over ppls head. They really want ppl to push NF, dunno why they cant balance others instead of making NF "meta".

[1:33:28] Lesrek: @I_DoctorSatan_I Problem for hunters and druids is that most will go NF regardless.  Imagine if NF was bad
[1:33:46] mulletrocker11358: @Towelliee did you watch Army of the Dead last nite? if so.. thoughts?
[1:33:53] tyrel_jones: U think the wanted quest would net you 4-5k more xp?
[1:34:06] uberhart: thrash blade is better with crusader enchant
[1:34:11] I_DoctorSatan_I: @critcobain that's such bullshit, because im Venthyr BM Hunter and Im not going to jump ship to NF because "Blizzard" is pushing ppl to go NF. Ive invested TOO much time and effort in Venthyr already to switch.
[1:34:15] akia03: venthyr lock one makes the crap skill do 40k damage now

[1:36:54] I_DoctorSatan_I: @Lesrek That's the problem, 76% of just Hunters are NF. Id imagine that number will increase and leave Venthyr and Necrolord Hunters in the dust and be "last kid" to be picked out of the group. I cant even get into 14/15's bc im Venthyr.
[1:37:19] CritcobainTV: @I_DoctorSatan_I Your covenant isn't the reason you don't get into 15s, sorry to break it to ya

[1:39:31] CritcobainTV: @Towelliee Once you hit like 58, my gf is trying to farm scholo for the major mana pot recipe, so she can heal it on her resto druid
[1:39:34] Kinghorn: most everyone stopped raiding on horde side on the server

[1:41:35] TheItalianStallion321: lawbringers
[1:41:36] CritcobainTV: Honestly bro if u want gear we just need to do ZG and AQ 20, it's just as good if not better than half the MC Gear @Towelliee
[1:41:43] TheItalianStallion321: judgement is T2
[1:41:44] j2c87: lawbringer
[1:41:57] smokingcactus: boost gear is pretty bad

[1:42:16] Holysal: i have a 45 ring thats the same as the boosted gear
[1:42:21] mitchumtx: why would they do that to the boosted gear?
[1:42:27] Pancho_Man: Communal set op
[1:42:32] misomander: if i were you id definitely try and sneak into an aq40 almost all the gear in there is literal bis even thru naxx, prot pal doesnt use much naxx gear outside of maybe wep/shield and like 1 other piece
[1:42:46] astonishhhh: My lvl 24 blue staff was better than the one hand / off hand on my mage
[1:42:47] instructOS: boosted druid gear isnt that bad for feral
[1:42:51] Vondrex: shine is a good mae
[1:42:55] MisterPooky: should just be happy that you get a lvl 58
[1:43:00] kirbbles: I think my plan is just farm the cheap blue pvp gear to replace the boost greens and use those to level in BC
[1:43:00] OriginalGangsterGrow: I love watching @Towelliee , already watching you for some years
[1:43:04] misomander: zg and aq are lvl 50

[2:23:35] Mewkus: I remember legit using a guide when I bought the game on launch and I still didnt know shit.
[2:23:36] Moobot: towGreen Shadowlands Limited Edition TOWELLIEE covenant shirts AND Towelliee hats are LIVE! check them out HERE! | Dbh.la/towelliee towBlue
[2:23:39] ballininmypjs: i hear you
[2:23:48] CyonDru: I think gear is pretty easy to get in classic
[2:23:52] Karsus79: @Towelliee  last year i got full tier 2 onm my hunter then i stopped playng  :S full dragonstalker set
[2:23:53] zeebo221: maybe 10 man onys just not 20 man mcs in the first 2 weeks
[2:23:55] illan_payne: Your ignoring the politics of loot distribution in 40 man raids when bosses drop 2 items
[2:23:56] itscityboy: big true
[2:23:57] very__legal: true
[2:24:00] Mekkols: classic is more sand box gearing
[2:24:04] Masqerader: He gets more satisfaction getting mythic raid weapons from the vault while the rest of the guild suffers, is what he really means
[2:24:07] IZemekiSI: yea because it took forever it forced you to see the content
[2:24:15] thiccsushi: I got bored of classic after I leveled I couldn't take the 1 button rotation anymore I just prefer retails classes being more fleshed out
[2:24:17] nl_Jewfro: very
[2:24:17] Rerdan: !Siege Survival: Gloria Victis
[2:24:20] paulcernik: you mean vanilla and lunch classic xD
[2:24:21] CyonDru: Plus in classic you can just keep spamming and it’s so easy
[2:24:23] legobind: aq was the same way
[2:24:32] Rerdan: lol sorry wrong chat
[2:24:33] mrblond5: Yep
[2:24:37] TheCliffyShow: When leveling felt epic and not, "let's get through this as quickly as possible with as little effort as possible".
[2:24:38] CritcobainTV: gearing in classic is basically loot just coming in waves. If you're not top on prio list, you wont get gear for a month, and then suddenly when everyone else has all their shit, you'll get all your gear at once
[2:24:39] j2c87: releasing classic wow with patch 1.12 was the mistake; gear was fucking nuts compared to original wow, and talents were way better.  Most gear when original TBC came out didn't have stats like spell power/ap, people had INT and Stam
[2:24:41] zeebo221: well i mean the whole point of classic is to go fast so if you didnt speed run i could see that
[2:24:45] Chiraakitteh: In vanilla, folks hadn’t figured out those gearing strats... would have to kill google and give everyone amnesia to match the orig raiding xp LUL
[2:24:51] gajoxi: @Towelliee BROOO that green color thingy behind u is fucking amazing, - could u do like a utube video on what lights those are etc?
[2:24:55] TheUnknowing: mage zoomies
[2:24:59] TheItalianStallion321: he provides a service lol. hes all business
[2:25:02] throwawaym3: APES clears BWL in 40minutes on release date "YO LET ME TELL YOU BOUT HOW HARD CLASSIC WAS"
[2:25:04] CritcobainTV: @Towelliee no point for kings, him gathering all the mobs takes more than 10 min LUL
[2:25:10] Wulfgrym: shinne knows that dungeon like the back of his hand
[2:25:17] emeraldwrath: !guild
[2:25:22] gajoxi: @Towelliee Like how it isnt full green, its like green/black smokey thingy whats that
[2:25:23] emeraldwrath: !tbc
[2:25:23] Moobot: @emeraldwrath Prepatch has officially launched! || If you would like to join our community guild in classic while we prepare, we are on Azuresong Horde!

[2:25:47] queezzn: What u think about blood elf mage?
[2:25:54] akaari5486: So are you going to stick to retail or tbc classic ?
[2:25:56] CyonDru: I don’t think Classic was hard back in the day. Players were just bad cause it was a whole new experience in gaming. Can’t blame em everyone were noobs lol
[2:25:59] Seitz501: Sounds expensive
[2:26:11] Aravarth: Does it make noises when you turn it on like transformers do? KOO-KAA-KOO-KAA-CHEE
[2:26:25] jatral: can someone invite carclas to the guild
[2:26:30] gajoxi: @Masqerader ye its super nice
[2:26:33] j2c87: releasing classic wow with patch 1.12 was the mistake; gear was fucking nuts compared to original wow, and talents were way better. Most gear when original TBC came out didn't have stats like spell power/ap, people had INT and Stam
[2:26:38] DrakhanGaming: was illidan a hard boss back in tbc?
[2:26:43] DreamWebb: they didnt have any data pre 1.12 didnt they
[2:26:52] johnnboitoi: You'll never get that experience back unless they just make it harder
[2:26:54] MuttonChopins: what is the vanilla experience for raiding
[2:26:54] BluesteelHD: why cant you blame blizzard they took the path of least resistance
[2:27:00] IZemekiSI: well how much of that original team is even at blizard anymore?
[2:27:01] EKS90_: they had little data on vanilla aswell
[2:27:02] Aravarth: I imagine they did a really crappy job of version archiving @DreamWebb
[2:27:16] pk99: My vanilla experience: having dial up and not able to play at all.
[2:27:18] CritcobainTV: it's bolted into the ground lol
[2:27:21] CritcobainTV: EZ
[2:27:29] gajoxi: its amazing dude
[2:27:39] Karsus79: wow towel
[2:27:45] CritcobainTV: It's fucking gorgeous
[2:27:56] akaari5486: @jeffcolv187 so u think classic was hard even with post nerf ?
[2:28:05] SlackerSlack017: slick
[2:28:06] Tecni: Was that a plushie from Wildstar @Towelliee ?
[2:28:06] Moobot: Check out Towelliee's latest Youtube video! https://youtu.be/U8-64zqVa8k Shadowlands needs some help

[2:28:24] LeroyEngels: i want it Kreygasm
[2:28:26] Shugaze: very nice man
[2:28:29] marbas001: that's a good job I run a remodeling business had to make a custom entertainment center a couple months ago turned out great
[2:28:31] pk99: that room is bigger than i always thought it was LUL
[2:28:32] TMMOOF: thats so dope
[2:28:34] ballininmypjs: I seriously hope Blizzard eventually gets it together with there content releases for retail. I love classic but right now i feel like thats all i can play to really enjoy WoW.
[2:28:41] Frank4LuLz: sweet Arthas
[2:28:42] Broomba: is that the banister for the stairs @towelliee -- i take it ur upstairs?
[2:28:43] SteLawBro: I want somebody to look at me like towel looks at his shelf.
[2:28:43] Deggon: noooo Goku!!!!!
[2:28:51] kingsink1825: bottle of pappyssss

[2:29:04] DreamWebb: you didnt want glass doors? those models gonna get dusty real quick
[2:29:09] CyonDru: Happy for you man. That’s dope @towelliee
[2:29:12] Herius99: get some big boy warhammer figure in that would look crazy
[2:29:14] ballininmypjs: thats awesome
[2:29:18] kingsink1825: i cannot ffind pappys
[2:29:36] elbinn: nothing says evil lich king helm of domination like being surrounded by cute dragon plushies
[2:29:40] marbas001: did they use a brick back slash type tile or is it real brick
[2:29:41] geokouts: i got 2 Funk Pops Freddie Mercury, gift from my sisiter
[2:29:42] j2c87: @popikaify dont think vanilla was ever hard - outside of Naxx when people didn't know the mechanics, but something like mana was actually an issue in original vanilla - In Classic WoW bosses died in 30 seconds your first clear - healers just spammed their fastest most inefficient heals the whole time because mana was not a problem due to the crazy DPS
[2:29:45] TheGaoSora: no Jaina statue? D:
[2:29:57] mcsadpants: issue with classic wasnt just post nerf it was on the 1.12 client making it easier gear wise and talent wise in earlier patches rogues had a "thrown weapon skill talent" then they changed it to weapon skill
[2:30:01] jsoal: Crazy. I came for wow content
[2:30:03] j2c87: even in vanilla 1.12 people could pug MC in trash gear
[2:30:11] DrakhanGaming: ford, built tough

[2:49:03] George2001k: @towelliee you can do a lot of things if it’s unmanned. With a drone Gs are no problem.

[3:14:09] thiccsushi: I dont think they will leave mistweaver in the dumpster it will probably make its return for the buff next patch
[3:14:16] Shongoshi: is bear fun like in legion ?

[3:14:52] Dawneskye: Its a weak aura i think someone said yesterday @arzeldon
[3:15:03] Ballavar: bear was still around with the mark of ursol
[3:15:04] trivwik: Yeah, Bear tank has so many lego options that can make it play so different

[3:15:11] necrolic1: wouldnt be more fun if you'd just questing and experience the pala lvling btw?
[3:15:12] jacooners: artifcat i think
[3:15:23] Shongoshi: luffa was that trash stacks higher or something right ?
[3:15:24] trivwik: Bear will pop the fuck off with two lego's
[3:15:28] Paramourn: @necrolic1  He has been lvling by questing
[3:15:28] thiccsushi: I'm hoping 9.2 is double lego with tier set
[3:15:35] RocketMan23: avengers shield reset + bulawark
[3:15:41] JonnyScotland: at the end of the expansion it will happen imo
[3:15:44] RocketMan23: kyrian divine toll leggo + bulwark
[3:15:46] Aro725: Isnt it funny how blizzard trys to reinvent the wheel and then adds stuff from old expansions back that we loved as new content LUL LUL
[3:15:47] Znza: legion was so fun, i miss it :(
[3:15:48] JonnyScotland: like last very patch
[3:15:57] akia03: maybe 1 clas spec one and 1 cov one
[3:15:59] SamDavidsin: what the heck am i watching, is 1 mage just playin pickle in the middle with an entire mara dungeon? LUL
[3:16:00] dalaraz: @thiccsushi they cant balance 1 lego,and you want 2 legos and tiersets ? :p
[3:16:01] Znza: oh that sounds op
[3:16:01] magemaster225: theyll do it last patch and let u break the game
[3:16:03] Pandaslag: bear tank with both thrash
[3:16:07] DrakhanGaming: having 2 legendarys gets rid of one gear slot that people have to grind for, so blizz wont let that happen, they want us to play the game
[3:16:07] Masqerader: thrash legendary and bring back TD
[3:16:11] Masqerader: all I want
[3:16:19] BluSnep: a lot of dps classes will be way more engaging with 2 leggos so I feel like they should
[3:16:24] trivwik: With TBC I dunno if I will go back for a long while.
[3:16:29] Krue_Sr: about as nuts as the corrupted abilities from BFA
[3:16:52] carma59: 2 leggos is so fun tho
[3:16:54] trivwik: Corrupted gear was just terrible
[3:16:56] carma59: let the people have fun
[3:17:06] dalaraz: they cant make 1 lego balanced,2 legos will be a mess,imagine adding tier sets to that lol,no way @Towelliee
[3:17:06] Lesrek: Lego could count as tier pieces if they went that route
[3:17:06] MightBeArtemis: 2pc with a biscuit
[3:17:06] Tru1485: that will be right back to legion issues
[3:17:12] magemaster225: maybe theyll let you runeforge 2 affects on 1 legendary
[3:17:21] Stonefather: Twilight Dev was the most fun I have ever had
[3:17:26] Frank4LuLz: Legion Tanking Bis
[3:17:27] Willamd: we had tier sets and 2 leggos at the end of legion
[3:17:32] carma59: 8.3 WITH the vendor was fun the fact that it was on a rotation was dumb
[3:17:34] Ballavar: we get them last patch, it makes numbers get out of hand, then they can justify another level squish and make the game as intended, level 1-20 max level
[3:17:37] RickyLos: you got to mara. congratz
[3:17:37] TheUnknowing: Twilight dev was great
[3:17:38] Znza: tanking in MoP was top tier
[3:17:41] MrTerkyMan: I feel like they should have a like, 8 piece class set cosmetically and then a way to pick which items you want to have your set bonus so its more flexible
[3:17:43] jaybdzn: 8.3 tank were invincible
[3:17:44] ParzTV81: corruption ruined the game imo
[3:17:44] Znza: my fav expac to tank
[3:17:46] Masqerader: corruption was awesome
[3:17:51] magemaster225: prenerf echoing void was where it was at
[3:17:54] Shongoshi: shadow priest in BfA were a lot of fun to play
[3:17:55] carma59: it was the rotation of the vendor
[3:17:56] Philosa_Raptor: TD in my blood DK was amazing
[3:17:56] Masqerader: and dying to it was even better
[3:17:58] ProfJeffs: full tank twilight dev raids were pretty fun xD
[3:18:05] smashwow: the rotation while the delay was awful
[3:18:05] Krue_Sr: the vendor shouldn't have had a rotation - thats my issue
[3:18:05] Atruis_: Cause they want people to keep playing
[3:18:12] Willamd: because we will abuse it
[3:18:18] Lesrek: legion legos would have been the best system they've ever had if it had vendors from the start
[3:18:19] Willamd: before they can nerf
[3:18:23] feelingthis2020: HAMMER OF FUCK YOUR FACE
[3:18:25] Frank4LuLz: afraid to give us good gear, and sockets
[3:18:41] strike879: because stupid ppl will complain when they buy the wrong thing
[3:18:43] Stonefather: Going into Ashran and hitting for over 1 million with three twilight devs danKEK
[3:18:43] Moobot: Check out Towelliee's latest Youtube video! https://youtu.be/U8-64zqVa8k Shadowlands needs some help
[3:19:33] thiccsushi: 9.3 anima infused gear Kappa
[3:19:36] Dethmetalhed: Dethmetalhed subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 11 months! Hammers up!!
[3:19:38] tocu: the vendor having a rotation was pretty bad though
[3:19:38] IZemekiSI: yep bc adds sockets thats right
[3:19:40] RaidbossTV: boosting is so heavyyyy
[3:19:52] Philosa_Raptor: For sheer ridiculousness BFA was awesome just for general game play I like SL more
[3:19:53] Broomba: @towelliee what prot pally talent tree are you using in bc pp?
[3:19:58] fistofnature: they need to buff the drop rate of the anima touched weapon fragments EleGiggle
[3:20:02] Willamd: yeah but it is still like 2 levels per hour
[3:20:03] Masqerader: i loved being able to hit mobs for 1.5 twilight dev when that shit proc'd with vision of perfection
[3:20:07] biirrd: you get about 20k xp/h more now
[3:20:10] akia03: one of the boostees higher lvl?
[3:20:16] Stonefather: 20g? That's a steal
[3:20:19] ThatTuesdayGuy: mara is going for 50g per run on my server....
[3:20:20] FancyJTS: What level are the others in your grp?
[3:20:22] Kineticbomb: It's just boring standing around waiting.
[3:20:28] trivwik: Corruption gear was fun. Some people, not all. I can't stress not all.. Could not complete content without it.
[3:20:31] SymphonyOnIce: shameless
[3:20:33] SamDavidsin: how many runs does 20g get you
[3:20:34] Willamd: and if you a enchanter grabbing all the greens will actually make you money
[3:20:35] RogueBear: i think you're losing some exp from what totem hes jumping on to change the mob direction.
[3:20:40] Kineticbomb: I you could at least help it would be more fun.
[3:20:45] tocu: @Kineticbomb its pretty great for a streamer though who can interact with chat
[3:20:46] RogueBear: too much time between damage to the mobs
[3:20:46] Kineticbomb: if*
[3:20:47] Bames01: dam 20g. ppl on skeram charging 50-75g for mara boosts
[3:21:01] OoOeightyproofOoO: bigger XP pool per level as you level more. you were getting around 140 xp per kill yesterday now you're getting around 180 xp
[3:21:08] Benji195: your only getting 65k exp per hour. I was getting 80k xp/hour on my priest over 5 hours at 48-52 jsut questing. People are sleeping on questing. You just have the benefit of not having to pay attention
[3:21:08] Vajazle: Vajazle gifted a Tier 1 sub to Stonefather! They have given 2 Gift Subs in the channel! 
[3:21:15] LSBreed: so ~4 runs to 45
[3:21:17] Redacted_: isnt hinterlands level 40+?
[3:21:19] trivwik: People doing 20+ in bfa but can't do a 15 this season.
[3:21:20] magemaster225: gotta grind out RFK/ZF now
[3:21:21] Ballavar: 60 is the lowest on earthfury atm
[3:21:22] Willamd: wait till pallies start getting geared up and start boosting prices will go down
[3:21:36] Stonefather: @Vajazle Thanks for the gift sub!
[3:21:38] BRUTALIT0PS: Good morning y'all
[3:21:40] Curtsy: Oh, pallies AoE boost too?
[3:21:43] Frank4LuLz: supply and demand...Murika
[3:21:47] Garsto: theyre non elites now
[3:21:49] Pancho_Man: shouldnt be
[3:21:50] DrakhanGaming: I thought boosting was dead because questing gives more exp now? or is that when tbc actually launches
[3:21:51] Garsto: i just did em
[3:21:57] hbsause: no longer elites correct

[3:22:15] d0c7: kings him
[3:22:23] Thur1990: Solo paladin is fine?
[3:22:47] Curtsy: Solo paladin can be fine, if you have uncontested AoE grinding areas it can be fun, but its still subjective
[3:23:32] Gizimoo86: its more like 2 hours per lvl when doing quests
[3:23:47] CritcobainTV: yeah, 3
[3:23:47] Kineticbomb: ask him
[3:23:53] CritcobainTV: 1 booster and 3 boostees
[3:23:53] Frank4LuLz: yes 3
[3:23:54] Willamd: 4
[3:23:57] Lazarenth: theres more "bonus exp" with 4, but its split 4 ways
[3:23:59] captain_steve_rogers: more exp with 4
[3:24:03] EnterSandman328: average level
[3:24:07] Zuut_: there used to be a full group bonus, did they take that out?
[3:24:08] captain_steve_rogers: bonus
[3:24:08] crudbox: you want 4
[3:24:13] Lazarenth: 3 gets the most xp toe ach person
[3:24:15] JelloBahamut: !spec
[3:24:25] jacooners: you want the avergae lvl of the group lower so you want 4
[3:24:26] JTbroussard: i am solo leveling a pally and really enjoying it
[3:24:45] papaherc: man i wanna boost but i rerlled a horde server and i have no gold lol
[3:24:54] DrakhanGaming: is it true you can be exalted with silvermoon after the belf questline?
[3:25:09] Chiraakitteh: Well, y’all could pitch in the difference
[3:25:18] Chiraakitteh: For having one less person
[3:25:27] kusosando: should I boost mage or warlock
[3:25:31] DrakhanGaming: mage
[3:25:35] kusosando: already have priest/warrior
[3:25:37] DrakhanGaming: way more fun than locks
[3:25:44] kusosando: yeah warlock is pretty boring
[3:25:47] BRUTALIT0PS: Mage
[3:25:47] kusosando: sb sb sb sb sb sb sb
[3:25:52] dalaraz: see looks so attached to lula :p
[3:26:11] BRUTALIT0PS: You can earn gold and stuff from ports, so mage is always a good option imo
[3:26:27] Gizimoo86: yeah got tomorrow like 8 days to go from 40-60 with normal questing yikes
[3:27:03] Shurn_82: in canada, Sweaters are a lifestyle in general lol

[3:31:20] kristin_mckenzie12: have you used origin laptops? just curious
[3:31:37] Ballavar: second rule of BIOS - make sure your pc is trying to catch of fire, but dosent
[3:31:45] Dawneskye: When i got my first PC in highschool.... i might have deleted a lot of files, not knowing what they were (schools used macs back then, important stuff was hidden, lol) I was dubbed the human computer virus, lol

[3:33:01] izabeL: laptop will never be as good as desktops for gaming
[3:33:05] Benji195: with origin your paying for service, nothing exceptional on the hardware side. As someone who has 2 origin computers, you can get similar or better hardware for cheaper elsewhere. But the service at origin is best in class
[3:33:09] Baldarsar: @Towelliee  but the downside is there fucking expensive
[3:33:22] HeBeDead: that might be a good way to build credit honestly
[3:33:24] KappaSlasher: If 3080s were actually obtainable maybe
[3:33:49] HeBeDead: depending on the interest LUL

[3:34:33] IZemekiSI: scalpers are horrible
[3:34:33] Falxftw: i run a car deaership, we cant even get cars because of the shortage, no production, cars cant run without chips
[3:34:37] KappaSlasher: Yes thats been the problem for a while THAT is why 3080s are scarce

[3:35:21] KappaSlasher: The semi conductor problem IS why 3000 series cards are scarce

[3:35:26] Th3Hammer: hows it going fam? Anyone have a relatively budget friendly recommendation for a gaming keyboard? Cats jumped on mine and literally broke my spacebar in half

[3:59:53] Shuttlelol: 60-70 in instances then going back to finish quests at 70 will be crazy gold i rekcon
[3:59:55] warrenny: Drsadsteed covered
[3:59:58] spacemarine55: you will make about 1k gold leveling by design so players would be able to afford their mount
[3:59:59] Shrenko: quests right now at lvl 60 gives tons of gold @Towelliee
[4:00:02] oradros: if you grindyour way to 70 without quet and then questing the gold award is huge
[4:00:06] dalaraz: there aint many dailies at p1 i think
[4:00:06] delelyn: if im not wrong you can get around 700-1k by questing
[4:00:07] Lebasto: given the economy you can prob make stupid money with just gathering professions
[4:00:11] boombescu: there are dayles q at low lvl? :)
[4:00:16] Nyxel: are therereally that many dailies? i know sunwell patch intruduced a lot but besides that?
[4:00:32] HotDadGG: im a relatively new WoW player but I feel like I am from an alternate universe because I could have swore Cataclysm was the first expansion. Its like a Mandela effect
[4:00:37] oradros: extra gold because your are cap
[4:00:38] NovaSun84: yuppers
[4:00:47] Kineticbomb: Also, party with rogues for normal/heroic dungeons. We can open locked chests in those dungeons that contains gold and lots of gems and BOE's.
[4:00:48] uberhart: if you backtrack you will make even more gold
[4:00:54] defcon8319: did you boost your pally
[4:00:57] IZemekiSI: yeah most def BC added so much money to the game
[4:00:58] GoKu1g: This way of leveling is a bit slow and boring isnt it??
[4:01:05] Treir44: @HotDadGG lol
[4:01:18] spacemarine55: ya so you can lie to us and tell us you cant open it then after we all leave you open them lol
[4:01:18] oradros: i clear netherstorm on my 70 hunter made 2k g easily
[4:01:33] GoKu1g: Wouldnt it be better if it was just you and the mage? so you get a bigger share of the XP ???
[4:01:39] NightChappy: I thought they patched out chests in tbc dungeons back in the day?
[4:01:40] IZemekiSI: there are so many areas thou in BC to level in
[4:01:50] TettixHD: wow 1-35, that's not 1-60 Kappa
[4:01:52] notColt45: Don't fall for the rogues tactics, he just wants to be invited Kapap
[4:01:53] breadwilton: ya but they would charge more then
[4:02:02] AFKSammich: AFKSammich subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 74 months! 
[4:02:05] NovaSun84: With 5man dungeons you split between group.  So this is actually better
[4:02:13] Dlaw25: 20 BE Pally, where should I be leveling?
[4:02:17] NovaSun84: In a raid though, its better to be solo for ZG
[4:02:30] Mosoner: Actually better to have a full party when 5 man dungeon boosting
[4:02:32] lockpdog: Its going high for SM and Mara on alliance Pagle
[4:02:38] Frank4LuLz: dont hate the player, hate the game
[4:02:42] EnterSandman328: but ZG you are within the boosters level range so less drop off
[4:02:46] mmrghost7: well at the speed of leveling i'm going on my draenei , i wont hit even 55
[4:02:47] Amygdalya: my goal is at least 58, 52 atm

[4:03:08] Nutsy: What is the reason for not being able to boost BE and Drenai?
[4:03:20] IAmAntonyJ: I am level 46 on my Draenai currently.
[4:03:25] lockpdog: I feel like getting SM boosted then going to Zul'Farrak then BRD is the move
[4:03:28] Dlaw25: terrible time for ads
[4:03:33] CrusaderNero: @Nutsy so they can introduce it later in BC and get more money
[4:03:54] TMMOOF: so mages remain boost meta?

[4:07:50] Maruika: its gona be a boar slaughter
[4:07:52] GoKu1g: theres LITERALLY going to be 1000's of players in the starting zones, so questing is going to be impossible. so going from 60 to 62 in dungeons for a bit will then people would of moved on
[4:07:53] HeBeDead: vanilla leveling was bomb
[4:07:57] Collected1: it's like this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1sZ2a0VaOQM

[4:08:29] DirtyBeef2134: !elvui
[4:08:30] IZemekiSI: oh most def , thats because everyone has crap and gearing and its just the best track , do ragefire then just keep going
[4:08:33] notColt45: I think doing the prep to turn in quests on launch to get fast level up is a good idea to not fight the rush.
[4:08:35] pedrodepacas1: i think initial zangar quests are 61? maybe do the hub in western hellfire first
[4:08:36] just_kirk_: Gotta let the try hards get out of the way

[4:28:48] swordwindgaming: anima farming eats so much time too
[4:28:51] CrusaderNero: you can stream and play everyday and grind. most people cant
[4:28:52] torridcheese3: @ayoBob Get the questie addon

[4:29:37] Sevcikova: I'm just BGing now ..
[4:29:37] Destronicus: Yeah, I was going to say.  It is a different exeprience between those that play 8 hours a day vs 8 hours a week
[4:29:47] Xindii: Anyone still anima farming is dedicated mofo Kappa
[4:29:47] dark_oktober: @stompsville well thats relative to the player right. For those of us that are busy and consume the content a lot slower, it'll take way longer to burn out

[4:30:10] breadwilton: @dark_oktober ya just like retail but majority of players will be done very quick
[4:30:11] Aidler: yeah not sure why but I‘m trying to get all the transmogg stuff from the covenants
[4:30:22] Kneckt: pog
[4:30:24] purrfecto: what makes it volatile is that it's the first tier of this patch that has the biggest draught
[4:30:26] TheGaoSora: if the anima quest were 500+ per quest thing would have felt much better

[4:31:33] strike879: @towelliee but its not really fair to blame blizz for a guy in Asia eating a bat
[4:31:35] carma59: shadowlands fell short on worldquests
[4:31:40] unholyhoit: they also made world quests worse on purpose on top of making them unrewarding @Towelliee
[4:31:44] IZemekiSI: yeah but even then there arent that many
[4:31:49] ZagFan590: World content in SL is pointless.
[4:31:50] legobind: what they need to do is make the next xpac  be like tbc
[4:31:53] magemaster225: thats fine, wqs arent good
[4:31:53] warrenny: @strike879 No

[4:32:03] lianddre: but world quests always felt trash
[4:32:04] darkside72: I liked the last two expansions, plenty of things to do.. Shadowland I've barely logged in after leveling.
[4:32:05] ANTRAUM: what addon are you using for auctioning?
[4:32:06] lianddre: its boring content
[4:32:07] IZemekiSI: dont get me wrongi am glad to be back to the game been too long
[4:32:13] warrenny: @strike879 but ppl do
[4:32:16] Aidler: I do WQs all day long
[4:32:20] TheGaoSora: Blizzard listened to the classic andys who don't even play retail
[4:32:23] Silentcrits: Retail needs to stop trying to redo Legion and come up with something new with less convoluted systems on top of systems
[4:32:24] Shrenko: @Aidler no you dont
[4:32:27] Luuin: I just need an entirely new MMO to play for something different.  I just hope to god AoC is good.

[4:33:10] MisterPooky: siege was like 9 months tho wasnt it ?
[4:33:10] Lumimyrsky: @Luuin Same! but the issue is if you've played WoW for several years you just end up comparing other MMO's to WoW :D
[4:33:18] rauko_64: @Towelliee when did you get the special hearthstone?

[6:00:01] Sollice: You die, you die
[6:00:01] Elimz89: just use common sense roll system
[6:00:03] Dawneskye: LUL @BigMucker
[6:00:07] Wildside1177: loot council in a casual guild like this is not a good idea
[6:00:09] CodyKane: just roll, and leave it up to the gods!
[6:00:10] Lemonsqze: LUL
[6:00:11] pedrodepacas1: whats wrong with favouring someone though?
[6:00:13] Bazsidiver: rolling with soft reserve?
[6:00:21] pedrodepacas1: if they perform better or have been there longer etc
[6:00:22] tripreality00: just do council choose 3-4 people to roll. best if both worlds.
[6:00:27] SpaghettiMonsterCleric: ^

[6:01:09] Sarole: its harder than being fair with all of your kids
[6:01:09] JestasGG: Loot council can never give loot to the ladies or drama inc
[6:01:10] misomander: even fang of the leviathan in SSC is a hot topic between your prot pallies and casters
[6:01:16] NovaSun84: In Loot council I found the leaders usually get fucked pretty badly just due to guilt.  ANY piece that goes to them someone is bitching in the pack
[6:01:23] pedrodepacas1: soft res seems to be relatively drama free too
[6:01:23] shanedille: loot on player rotation
[6:01:23] Dawneskye: cause if the tanks die, raid wipes, healers go oom, raid wipes.
[6:01:24] IZemekiSI: yeah rolling can fuck ya thou if you got crap rng
[6:01:29] HammerHeadShark: I mean my guild gave me 1 piece of loot in all of naxx and I was a tank, it's because I wasn't "favored" 100% lol I saved so many runs because the others tanks sucked.
[6:01:30] ThaOriginalGamester: At the end of the day, it's about the journey Kappa

[6:15:43] Pizzabagels87: how much roughly are these runs if i wanted to do this
[6:16:00] mrelgaato: 20g
[6:16:01] Totemkatsu: think they're less with more people
[6:16:01] Aravarth: 20g per run I think
[6:16:01] nimeon01: Dunno how much it costs in gold but the cost of your soul is a bit steep
[6:16:09] Aravarth: if you have a full group, 20g
[6:16:11] Pizzabagels87: ah nice, ty
[6:16:18] SonofHorus82: @Pizzabagels87 it depends entirely on your server and who is doing the run.
[6:16:23] Aravarth: if you're going solo, you'll prolly pay 40-50g
[6:16:24] MrWeedoz: sucks to be fresh char atm, no one is doing normal dungeon runs at all
[6:16:25] sperg0verlord: will wow ever have proximity mics ?

[6:16:39] nihilist74: isnt it almost as fast just to run the dungeon
[6:16:40] nimeon01: who knows
[6:16:40] Totemkatsu: whats that mean
[6:16:50] nimeon01: like pubg and such
[6:16:54] jioxthelock: meaning the moment youre near someone you can hear their mic
[6:16:57] nimeon01: you can talk in the mic people that are near can hear you

[6:17:15] Keykeykadee: it'd a whole dungeon run in 15min
[6:17:15] MrWeedoz: it's already enough that racist bs is in chat, how they'd moderate it over voip?
[6:17:17] jioxthelock: yeah itll be like pubg and fucking league almost
[6:17:46] MrWeedoz: you don't want open house voice ppl, you want convenient way to talk with your friends, not with strangers LUL
[6:17:49] sperg0verlord: whats best professions for paladin?

[6:17:54] shrimpgf: big bump
[6:18:11] jioxthelock: well league make me big sad big mad
[6:18:18] Kineticbomb: By becoming more strict like Squareenix with FFXIV. they don't joke around and just straight up ban you.
[6:18:21] jioxthelock: it feels like SL pvp
[6:18:33] Kineticbomb: No warning most of the time. BAN
[6:18:47] MrWeedoz: like blizz would part with paying customer
[6:19:22] Kineticbomb: Being a paying customer does not mean you are allowed to be toxic.
[6:19:48] MrWeedoz: have you seen overwatch?
[6:19:59] Kineticbomb: Again, blizzard not being strict enough
[6:20:12] MrWeedoz: blizzard will never be what you expect them to be
[6:20:17] MrWeedoz: srty, it's bliz we talking about
[6:20:27] Kineticbomb: I know
[6:20:31] nimeon01: I dont understand why you care if people are racist or not just mute them and move on
[6:20:40] IcyBluePat: @Kineticbomb I really don't care what Blizzard does as I don't play WoW anymore, I only watch streamers play
[6:20:52] MrWeedoz: nimeon01 I rather have not to mute them in the first place, hence no need for voice
[6:20:52] Moobot: Check out Towelliee's latest Youtube video! https://youtu.be/U8-64zqVa8k Shadowlands needs some help

[6:24:08] nimeon01: I mean Im not a fan of proximity chat but I dont understand the argument against it, if people want it and there is a mute function I can use why not let them have it?
[6:24:11] WickedSorrow: Had someone with that BG addon say you were reported for being afk type /afk to remain in the bg
[6:24:19] rohdey: just as good as the /afk in bg's Kappa
[6:24:20] serru93: I even fell for it just by hearing it on stream :(

[6:24:47] DocsMistake: i mean i cant really say anything I totally accidentally alt f4'd myself setting up hotkeys the other day
[6:24:48] rohdey: Cleetus Cornwood?
[6:24:49] nimeon01: MrWeedoz again why does that matter if you have to go click a single button once
[6:24:49] tebbix: it is hard to leave WoW lol
[6:24:49] Exxcar: @nimeon01 because implementing it isn't cheap, and Discord already exists so what incentive does Blizzard have to make it?
[6:24:55] Thoreya: they put fragnance on the spriest lol
[6:24:57] Thoreya: outta nowhere
[6:24:57] Mygdrayl: /gquit in wow is the alt +F4 in IRL?

[6:25:30] nimeon01: MrWeedoz it doesn't thats the point I dont understand your logic at all
[6:25:32] MrWeedoz: nimeon01 ppl could opt IN to it, not OUT, would be used by ppl who REALLY want to use it
[6:25:33] Holysal: yes this is too see who makes next week
[6:25:36] tanks66611: what the highest key done so far ?

[6:26:56] a_joc: tmog

[6:27:19] Nowaayjose: I really wish they pushed the launch for some reason. I’m only 53 pally but I don’t feel like I have time to really settle before leveling in our lands again
[6:27:19] Onawanis: damn, mages are balanced
[6:27:22] jioxthelock: more visibility

[6:27:38] MarshallOnline: i liked the SL dungeons. Wish they would of been quicker with a patch tho its bee nway too long
[6:27:40] Shrenko: retail WutFace
[6:27:42] RerouteToHell: because DPS and Healing is necessary in +28s
[6:27:46] sneakyfull: a few times tho hes accidently been out of bear withour knowing PepeLaugh
[6:27:49] RerouteToHell: and most mobs one shot you asnyway
[6:27:52] RerouteToHell: so you mostly kite
[6:27:53] Wallife1: he doesnt like the default bear form and cant change to werebear

[6:28:28] HaggisLaddie: @Onawanis nothing is balanced in retail atm LUL
[6:28:29] Thoreya: i like the high key pushing concept
[6:28:29] Aravarth: B, A-N-A-N-A-S
[6:28:51] Mightbeworth: in your opinion, would it be worth it to make a bear tank in TBC? @Towelliee
[6:28:58] flebbooo: yea very true
[6:29:03] IAmAntonyJ: @mightbeworth bear tanks super strong
[6:29:04] sneakyfull: most of the mdi players eem to like the big pull style of mdi over the high keys tho
[6:29:11] RerouteToHell: @mightbeworth yes, Health is paramount in TBC
[6:29:14] nimeon01: Sl is a really good game but the premise of it is bad for me at least, weekly forced chores no way of catching up if you skip the weekly stuff and most of the classes having this one really annoying mechanic
[6:29:20] carma59: when they moved mdi to youtube I stopped giving a shit
[6:29:21] carma59: tbh
[6:29:36] Mightbeworth: appreciate the responses
[6:29:41] D3m0nHunt3r666: in legion it was 24
[6:29:44] alextheory_: I wish mdi would be on twitch i hate youtube layout
[6:29:47] alextheory_: for livestream
[6:29:48] D3m0nHunt3r666: those were some tests
[6:29:58] flebbooo: yea i wouldn't mind this taking over the mdi
[6:30:00] JerBoody: “MDI” just sounds better than the great push
[6:30:19] Thoreya: if they get good viewership from the great push watch them replace mdi with it
[6:30:31] sneakyfull: yeah I think to them the coordination to pull off the huge mdi pulls is more satisfying than all the strategy that goes in to just surviving the high keys. I agree that the high keys arent as exciting to watch cus its just a few mobs at the time. It is still crazy impressive though, they are nuts
[6:30:36] Dawneskye: my husband likes the atkins pb cups, and their lemon bars.
[6:30:36] crumbler81: LUL "the great push"
[6:30:38] waltoosaa: is that reese?
[6:30:41] RerouteToHell: @JerBoody but it's so bad for the players, think of this they are doing the same dungeons on +18 for months and months and months and months and months with the same affixes
[6:30:51] RerouteToHell: While The great push is dynamic

[9:04:52] mrblond5: compared to retail TBC  is easy but compared to classic there is huge difference in difficulty
[9:05:15] Alexakosgg: ohhh nvm
[9:05:16] ailoops: I am excited to see actually :D

[9:08:07] BRUTALIT0PS: No
[9:08:13] RobNXS: I think it goes into 25 vs 40 man raids. Fewer players means a lower tolerance for individuals to "zug zug" and ignore mechanics.

[9:36:04] Nalleys: ZF is fun at current level.  Specially for a quest run
[9:36:11] athuli2: You should still do it for quests
[9:36:13] D3m0nHunt3r666: my sham is 55
[9:36:22] Thunderlops: Jesus you’re already 46?
[9:36:23] Justarandomman: tbh, ZF is annoying with 5 people on quests, you never get it done in one run
[9:36:24] Aravarth: fair
[9:36:25] D3m0nHunt3r666: maybe for the next tier of dungeons
