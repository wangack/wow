[1:39:34] ask_peter: to master a class almost always has some skill-cap.  It depends of what content (PvE, PVP) and what goal one is aiming for.  so often I read like healers are easy or elemental shaman or stuff like this. I mean shaman in particular has so much utility which can separates a good from a master played shaman. I would think of druid (moonkin) to be kinda easy/safe to play. huge def kit, stealth and high burst.

[2:03:16] StreamElements: Redeem Points at point store https://streamelements.com/swifty/store
[2:03:19] The_Crafty_DM: critical effect sounds like the damage
[2:03:23] Onehiitter: increasing crit chance
[2:03:28] Malkir1: critical effect used to be a way of saying a crit
[2:03:36] Bnichoo: Critical effect chance means increased bonus when you get a critical
[2:03:40] The_Crafty_DM: critical chance is the percentage crit
[2:03:44] Bnichoo: at least that's how it is on retail
[2:03:54] koci53z: its 10% critical chance in elemental in resto both
[2:04:11] megaxxstreams: When you get a crib it’s greater then a normal crit is what it’s saying
[2:04:41] megaxxstreams: Crit *
[2:04:44] frooysaa: addons typically dont show you added crit% from talents, you have 16% crit right now
[2:04:48] XCT_x: crit chance is the % it has to crit, the crit effect means it will be bigger
[2:04:54] shmokey: Yeah if you crit, it increases that
[2:04:56] walcowz: extended character addon shows nature crit aswell
[2:05:00] shmokey: Similar to rogues talents

[3:28:24] Sakrasta: I think overclocking nowadays is just a waste of time. Most hardware is already pushed close to the limit. If you overclock you might only get 5-10% more performance and wear down your hardware faster.

[3:32:33] Mr_fantastic123: i think msi were caught scalping
