[0:58:07] nohemoglibin: I'm still hooked on Starfield for whatever reason
[0:58:24] Voidthos: Same with LE.  I decided to say fuck it and focus solely on LE starting today.  Since you don't lose your characters and they're just on an eternal realm, I'll fucking just create a character on season launch LOL
[0:58:31] Strke1: I bought the deluxe edition today. Steam shows i bought the game back in 2019 lol
[0:58:42] Voidthos: Plus the seasonal mechanics will apply to eternal realm too
[0:58:57] Daemoos6: You'll dive deep
[0:58:59] Voidthos: So cycles are legit just for the race/leaderboards and fresh start
[0:59:37] nohemoglibin: apparently there was a big patch for FF14, but I haven't found the motivation to log in
[1:00:14] Voidthos: Right
[1:00:30] Gummybeard1: Is there any Paladins class in LE?
[1:00:30] Voidthos: Those are my thoughts exactly.  I'm just tired of looking for something else to play when all I can think about is LE LOL
[1:00:59] Voidthos: Well if you plan content and need to do xyz to prep those weeks could potentially be fuller than you think
[1:01:09] nohemoglibin: 2nd playthrough.   On XBOX this time
[1:01:58] StreamElements:  Want to buy or fund anything for us to open, craft or build on stream? https://throne.com/luxthos

[1:02:46] Effin_Steffin: the problem is it's classic. those days are long gone
[1:03:04] hestar: You think you do, but you don't.. Kappa
[1:03:10] Thovarisk: aww man so many good memories from Naxx
[1:03:42] nohemoglibin: WoW doesn't feel good for me any more, and I don't know why.  Might be because so many of my friends are gone and I don't feel like making new friends?
[1:03:45] TaogWoW: The nostalgia just isn't there for me.
[1:04:38] DarkMoonDragons: been playing for 20 years or so and played alot of MMORPG's like EQ(EverQuest) but I don't really have alot of folks to play with. I recently joined anew guild of people around my age and it's picked up for me.

[1:57:55] Aggy: parnsip
[1:58:08] Vizho_: How did you change the LFD timer?
[1:58:52] Aggy: I can't work, my husband has gone to the vet with my dog and I'm waiting for news ;_;
[1:59:13] Voidthos: I ate that whole sub
[1:59:52] Voidthos: Did you see that news about D4 btw?
[2:00:05] Voidthos: @Aggy FeelsBadMan
[2:00:12] Voidthos: Delaying gauntlet
[2:00:24] Voidthos: Went from Feb13th to who knows.. watch them release it at LE launch lol
[2:00:38] Voidthos: No it's a bad idea 100%
[2:00:55] Voidthos: Raxx is suggesting to delay it until S4 with the itemization revamp and just chalk S3 up as a loss
[2:01:28] StreamElements:  Enjoying the stream? Considering subscribing to support: https://www.twitch.tv/subs/luxthos
[2:02:05] Voidthos: Hmm
[2:02:36] Voidthos: If they release it in S3 and it needs emergency hotfixes and shit though that's just even more of a blow to the faith in the game, which could hurt S4
[2:02:36] Stormrazer78: people stil don’t got that mount, even I got it
[2:02:59] Poxumo: no luck for me today either
[2:03:45] TheGiant99: The thing is there are still alot of people playing D4. Twitch isn't a good measuring stick of how many are actually playing a game
[2:04:47] Lemon_King: 7,634 on steam atm
[2:05:05] Lemon_King: Dec was 9,359.0
[2:05:05] TheGiant99: Steam is not battlenet
[2:05:18] Carahail: https://www.wowhead.com/news/new-hero-talents-revealed-priest-tripling-down-on-power-infusion-337611
[2:05:19] nohemoglibin: this season sucks.
[2:05:38] Voidthos: Huge loss since S3 launch, you're right
[2:06:15] Voidthos: https://activeplayer.io/diablo-4/
[2:06:49] MaxGrandpre: steam is not bnet, but the fluctuation is theorically the same thing. If things are going up, you'll see approximatly the same up % on many platforms, same if things aren't going well. Unfortunately, D4 isn't doing well right now.
[2:07:06] Voidthos: That's not from steam Max
[2:07:23] thomssone: The d4 classes are so boring for me
[2:07:30] Masqerader: the minute they tried to balance the game like an mmo for season 1, that pretty much killed it for me
[2:07:45] MaxGrandpre: Voidthos I wasn't answering to you :) Just the general discussion
[2:08:11] nohemoglibin: and they keep pushing back gauntlet
[2:08:13] Tzarrus: i mean look how long it took LA to actually be OK to play
[2:08:20] Tetravus: Loot filters are #1 thing for me. Sorting through tons of garbage items just sucks
[2:08:21] NervousFlash: 99% is too much hopium
[2:08:27] nohemoglibin: may as well move it to season 4 at this point
[2:08:43] Voidthos: D4 players on steam currently is 7k, 182k is total right now, down from 3mil on S3 launch
[2:08:59] grumpygamerdad: grumpygamerdad subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 38 months!

[2:10:31] jarilrpg: i want to finish my season stuff on D4, but can not, my game crashes upon launch since the new patch (tried repairing and reinstalling)
[2:11:06] fubarian297: im not havin any dc issues in d4

[2:14:05] MaxGrandpre: all good no worries, I won't be able to join on the next one tho I'll be in meeting :) Thanks tho !
[2:14:28] Zarolina: Wooo! Just ordered some more advanced, finally zaroliRave
[2:14:34] Voidthos: The game itself is fun to play.  For me #1 issue is itemization, it's not fun having to pick up every Ancestral drop to check if it's an upgrade, and then sit there and look at all the modifiers that do the same thing trying to figure out what is what lol
[2:14:54] Voidthos: Lack of endgame or whatever else is whatever
[2:14:55] Zarolina: Hydration. Lychee
[2:14:56] MaxGrandpre: all good haha
[2:15:08] Aggy: my biggest problem is itemization
[2:15:16] Aggy: If they fix it, i'm back
[2:15:32] Voidthos: Yeah for sure
[2:15:46] MaxGrandpre: D4 is overcomplicated to me :/ I kinda miss some simplicity I had in D3
[2:16:01] xZHEEx: I loved D2
[2:16:02] MaxGrandpre: There's just too much stuff to learn haha
[2:16:20] Voidthos: @MaxGrandpre I think a lot comes down to the prefex/suffix they have, there's so much bloat (itemization)
[2:16:33] MaxGrandpre: yea
[2:17:18] bwoods79: Have you been attempting the love rocket on all your alts?

[2:17:41] IAmSacrilicious: And D4 has a lot of '+X% damage when it's a monday, during a full moon and only on odd months'. At least during S1...
[2:17:56] MaxGrandpre: When you understand professions in WoW but nothing in D4, you can awknowledge that something went wrong in D4 haha
[2:17:56] Voidthos: LE loot filter is fantastic.  I set up colorization depending on the item base type, the amount of T3+ rolls on an item.. hide unused suffix/prefix or base types not meant for my class.. something drops I know it's a potential upgrade
[2:18:00] WAUDEX: happy to be here! always lurking hehe
[2:18:53] hlmutcz: yeah cant wait for falconeer
[2:19:05] TheGiant99: @voidthos I hope people have filters to share I suck at making them

Example: I use xbox controller for D4 when i am playing on pc. when i press A to interact with a npc or cast main ability, it works the first time then when i press it again it does something random like open the world map or something. Same thing happens with joysticks and other buttons.

[4:10:54] Voidthos: @alteration1545 Runemaster is most unique, and powerful.  Druid is a lot of fun and has shapeshifting like D4.  Bladedancer and Marksman are both strong and fun.  Necromancer/Lich are great, as is Void Knight
[4:11:00] nohemoglibin: I figured all this talk of meat would lure @RedMustardTV here

[4:11:48] Thovarisk: on some rice? sounds delish
[4:12:01] Voidthos: @Voidthos Beastmaster if you want animal companions, starts kind of slow though.  Shaman/Spellblade/Forgeguard are kind of old tech, they need to do a pass/update on them so I'd avoid those for now

[4:22:40] Pheoris: @Lemon_King It's got cojita cheese in it, and a lime creme that was drizzled on top. Here's the description, lol. --> This flatbread is inspired by Mexican street corn (grilled, seasoned corn like elote, but off the cob). The creamy, cheesy, slightly smoky fire-roasted corn is a powerful combination on top of our crunchy flatbread.

[4:24:58] Voidthos: Did you try Pacific Drive?  I went to bed early yesterday
[4:25:01] mentosz09: @Pheoris That's almost 2 of my meals lol
[4:25:14] mentosz09: As long as you give it away to me
[4:25:17] Pheoris: I'm trying to stick to less than 120 carbs, to start, but i know my doctor told me if I cut down to 50, the weight would melt off haha...

[4:25:45] Voidthos: Think you're misunderstanding what the game is.  It's exploration/crafting/scavenging

[4:25:59] Pheoris: i found these low carb mini tortillas that are good though
[4:26:10] Voidthos: Fair enough
[4:26:35] mentosz09: @Pheoris Pasta is BiS i have a issue with pastries lol
[4:26:38] Pheoris: ahh ok @mentosz09 :D yah i bought some lower carb stuff to try, but i'm noticing the problem is when there's low carbs, it seems fat is high... i don't want to eat more fat haha
[4:26:54] Pheoris: looks into palmini. i just bought it, but i haven't tried it yet @mentosz09
[4:26:56] Voidthos: Sci-fi, it wasn't scary to me
[4:27:13] Pheoris: yeah i try not to do low fat stuff either lol
[4:27:13] mentosz09: Low carb high protein
[4:27:24] mentosz09: The protein keeps you full
[4:27:34] Pheoris: right now i have my goals set at 119g protein, 45g fat and 119g carbs.
[4:28:01] Pheoris: i have a low calorie goal that probably isn't realistic, but seeing if i can stick to it lol.
[4:28:27] Pheoris: i put that i'm sedentary, even though i starting using the rowing machine again hahaha pheoriCoolStory
[4:28:54] Pheoris: oh well back to work for me. you kids have fun :P
[4:29:01] mentosz09: @Pheoris I use to eat these healthy choice steamer meals that were pretty dang good

[4:30:23] Pheoris: i usually go for chicken breast over beef or any other meat.. Dad picks on me for that, lmaoooo.
[4:30:48] Pheoris: I notice greek yogurt is a good food to eat that keeps me fuller longer haha.
[4:31:00] Gummybeard1: Im good fat
[4:31:03] Pheoris: another food doesn't really glaringly keep me full for long LOL
[4:31:45] Pheoris: yah i have no fat plain greek yogurt i think. I do something similar, I tend to put PB fit powdered PB in it, and some sugar free salted caramel syrup

[4:38:57] Voidthos: I'll be playing LE all day every day from here on out.  Favorite class?  Since coming back, Runemaster.  I deleted all my level 80+s to get a fresh perspective

[4:40:17] Voidthos: Going to play Runemaster and BM into end-game first, then my Paladin.  From there not sure what I'm going to make prior to launch.
[4:40:28] Voidthos: Cycle launch I'll probably be going Runemaster or Beastmaster
[4:40:46] Voidthos: Unless something changes during my testing leading up to it
[4:40:50] alteration1545: @Voidthos pally feels strong, I might do it on launch just to blast to end game and farm stuff for alt builds
