[1:36:16] Sebleh: I can’t believe Blizzard was so mad about double healers last TGP that they nerfed the dungeons to the ground. If time trials are any indication, you don’t even need healers for keys anymore. Maybe next MDI we’ll see double tanks too.
[1:36:17] Bearman999: should be tuned so that if you play no healer, every pull is dangerous
