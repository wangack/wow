[1:01:57] Nocturne118: arms, ret and dk were down bad in raid so it's good.
[1:02:08] chrissy_x93: how good are the ret buffs ?
[1:02:12] Sly_404: ret buff isnt as crazy as it sounds, its like 5% ST and 2-4% in AOE (not clear currently if the BoJ buff also extends to BoV)
[1:02:33] nrzk1: feel like galakron takes 10 min
[1:02:58] syku1: they were staring at the boss for 10 seconds, lets hope that wont matter

[1:05:58] luckyrabs: i love that crusading strike doesnt work on him xdd
[1:06:06] Sly_404: last boss in EB on tyra you can watch all LotR movies
[1:06:25] Exogenesis9: I mean you're about halfway and you've taken about 3m.
[1:06:34] alqallafi: they must nerf this boss health
[1:06:40] goosemoose_: @Sly_404 extended editions too
[1:06:43] syku1: @alqallafi why?

[1:07:03] goosemoose_: yo
[1:07:16] mirseaaaa: @alqallafi  they already doing 31s on this boss bro, if they nerf it it will be a meme dungen
[1:07:36] MaslovUA: !armory
[1:07:41] MaslovUA: no?(
[1:07:43] Sly_404: i really hope they rethink tyrannical for the next expansion and extend the reward system for m+ score
[1:07:46] bluemagic212121: hero
[1:07:46] syku1: @mirseaaaa they gotta nerf it so rets can do 31 aswell
[1:07:48] nuggiw: What are the yellow dmg numbers?
[1:07:49] Exogenesis9: Seems depleto
[1:08:03] yujik46: Sadge deplete
[1:08:07] Riddert__: @Sly_404 they spoke about a similar mount system arena has with vicious mounts
[1:08:07] nimmiemage: ye
[1:08:11] nimmiemage: not enough st
[1:08:11] alqallafi: @mirseaaaa do anything to make this boss more like dungeon boss not raid boss
[1:08:45] shi_xhi: depleto
[1:08:46] Sly_404: @Riddert__ that would be dope, like not having anything between 2.5k rating and season title is just sadge
[1:08:46] Ghendo: riprip
[1:08:55] Stormy_o: PepeLaugh
[1:08:58] mirseaaaa: it is a dungen boss but like I said, people are timing 31s already
[1:08:59] Brxdix: holy crap, over 7min for a boss
[1:09:00] wondermika: you should have used bl before
[1:09:03] Exogenesis9: I think Ret just has to swap to ST here for high Tyran
[1:09:06] Riddert__: @Sly_404 ye especially since 2.5k has become free
[1:09:07] wondermika: you overcap at the end on haste anyhow
[1:09:14] aefox: i dont t hink having aug is worth for some bosses
[1:09:18] syku1: @Exogenesis9 reducing their aoe by to much so they cant do that either
[1:09:21] mrwolfe27: !ui

[1:09:22] srbadin: thats why we get buff not to play 8 mins bos
[1:09:22] Verothe3rd: you don’t have good dps for this boss I guess. want haste specs
[1:09:35] nokeybindings: healer no weapon dmg and Aug kinda cringe I guess
[1:09:41] nerf________: go go 8min bos
[1:09:50] mirseaaaa: you need a 3rd dps, with aug you lose dps big time here
[1:09:51] Sly_404: @Riddert__ absolutely like this season you got 3k by accident and then basically got done with the season 4 week in
[1:10:00] Exogenesis9: @syku1 It's still the play.
[1:10:18] Zir_aus: aug is fake
[1:10:19] syku1: the play is to bring a better class
[1:10:22] syku1: not some meme ret
[1:10:29] xela900: aug is sim bait
[1:10:29] nimmiemage: yup
[1:10:30] xela900: :P
[1:10:41] mirseaaaa: ret is ok,aug is the problem in this boss
[1:10:45] srbadin: 9 min boss?
[1:10:47] Brxdix: aug is not that good anymore in this big keys, too much dmg loss
[1:10:52] Exogenesis9: I mean ST Ret is a god on Iridikron. You just have to deal with playing ST talents on a few packs beforehand, it's not that bad.

[1:11:36] mirseaaaa: @syku1  like 70-80k dps less
[1:11:37] wondermika: yeah aug on this boss can lead to big problems
[1:11:38] r34yumika: kekw
[1:11:39] srbadin: delete aug or at least remove it from meta
[1:11:40] nerf________: send fyrakk mythic it wont take 8min

[1:12:04] Tehqq_: Are you in our own office now?
[1:12:11] rapiwow: auras
[1:12:17] rapiwow: 83% that is decent
[1:12:18] Brxdix: let him play devastation kekw
[1:12:24] aefox: @Naowh do you think aug is worth for high keys anymore
[1:12:52] syku1: @aefox go check raider io leaderboards
[1:12:54] syku1: then you will have your answer
[1:12:59] darawsha94: thats big yes
[1:13:23] aefox: @syku1 i know they are using it but dont know it is because they used to it or not
[1:13:26] Repsie: @aefox top 100 keys, like 2 without aug. they bad COPIUM
[1:13:35] TheRealMoistnoodle: Ret with Aug is just not a good comp on tyran. With an aoe build rets dam is just depressing. Hopefully the buffs will balance it out some
[1:13:54] nerf________: 8min boss should be illigal
[1:14:25] mirseaaaa: @repsie  people are doing 30-31s without aug. Aug is the safe choice for some dungens
[1:14:28] goosemoose_: @tankprisonttv you pahmping keys?
[1:14:38] Exogenesis9: Just checked logs, CSAA still generates HoPo during absorb
