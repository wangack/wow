[0:43:58] MarcoFlee: raidbots is so useful
[0:44:06] BigTuckTV: monkaW
[0:44:07] GiantDuckKing: @jakenbakeLIVE I've seen a lot more use askmrrobot.
[0:44:07] Tenzo1o1: its takes all the gear, legendaries, talents, echants etc, and runs all the combinations in a sim, and outputs the damage avg of all the different gear combinations
[0:44:08] dium: anytime you are wondering if x is better than y or vice versa or whatever
[0:44:08] CallMeDoubleYou: monkaW that was close
[0:44:10] dium: sim yourself
[0:44:11] astrorangerz: it simpsulates dps
[0:44:12] MarcoFlee: HACKERMANS hacking into the mainframe
[0:44:13] lerler: simulates the best gear you can have from ur bank and storage, also, tells u best upgrade
[0:44:13] ralfeezy: HACKERMANS
[0:44:15] eshana122: Power I guessing 😂
[0:44:34] GiantDuckKing: @jakenbakeLIVE even allows you to import your bags, determine the best dps from what you have, and how to do the rotation.
[0:44:38] CallMeDoubleYou: PogU

[0:44:53] dium: patchwerk fight over 5 minutes
[0:44:54] Knoives: +205 dps PogU
[0:44:56] Tenzo1o1: yes, you were able to choose how long you want the fight to be
[0:45:03] MarcoFlee: yup, the avg of tons and tons of tests perfectly using your rotation
[0:45:04] eshana122: Yes you that’s the one
[0:45:05] Tenzo1o1: you can also choose the TYPE of fight
[0:45:13] eshana122: PanicVis
[0:45:45] Moobot: Ask a moderator for permission before posting a link, @Lvncerr (warning)
[0:45:50] MarcoFlee: monkaHmm true
[0:46:00] eshana122: Hmmm 🤔
[0:46:03] Tenzo1o1: since you only picked different bracers, it only simmed different bracers. You can pick ton of different combos and it will sim all of them
[0:46:11] DrS_Strange: why not run that legendary on the ring slot
[0:46:13] eshana122: Bracers
[0:46:24] astrorangerz: I love a good ring
[0:46:29] Knoives: rings are typically harder to get
[0:46:35] eshana122: The ring
[0:46:48] CallMeDoubleYou: Is there a reason people are more into this than ff14
[0:46:53] Slamph: cozobrOhi
[0:46:58] eshana122: You will her more power
[0:47:04] eshana122: Get
[0:47:13] SVPV: Surely you want a main armour piece since they’re higher ilvl so more main stat? Or do rogues not value agi that much? Seems odd
[0:47:15] eshana122: Lmfao
[0:47:18] Valyri4nSteel: me :)
[0:47:21] astrorangerz: I can't play WoW anymore, I got too addicted to that game played non stop for over 9yrs
[0:47:25] Tenzo1o1: but yeah in custom options you can choose fight duration, patchwerk single target fight, multi target fight etc to tailor it further. but ST patchwerk is the easiest for most situations
[0:47:31] PolygonStatic: i love ff but i couldnt get into 14
[0:47:36] eshana122: stella55Scared stella55Scared stella55Scared
