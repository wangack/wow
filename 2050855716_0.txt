[4:07:33] RagingPunk: its like 35 for me
[4:07:35] 91Niki: steam
[4:07:37] Broomba: Enshrouded is fun
[4:07:39] 3663Sharad: Steam, should be less then 30bucks
[4:07:43] LegendBarry420: I heard enshourded is a fun ride
[4:07:51] Wulfgrym: i like it more than pal world

[4:11:18] JQ47: Idk not enough different as well as a not strong season theme
[4:11:19] Grunton: they needed to keep s2 content in the game
[4:11:26] Maydie6066: @91Niki you still playing D4?
[4:11:30] Wulfgrym: i dunno, i think alot of wow players play d4
[4:11:34] Jango_: yeah the season theme is trash
[4:11:39] 91Niki: @Maydie6066 Yep. Just hit level 91
[4:11:43] jarilrpg: i figured i will finish leveling to 100 this season when the 50% xp bonus comes out (since i dont play SoD)
[4:11:48] 91Niki: Grinding the last season chapter
[4:11:54] Wulfgrym: all they had to do was make the pet stupid OP
[4:11:58] Jango_: as soon as i finish out the battle pass im done
[4:12:09] Maydie6066: @91Niki nice
[4:12:12] Wulfgrym: @91Niki woot, nice 9 more
[4:12:16] lithium364: last epoch soon tho
[4:12:22] MedicineMan: they’re making big changes to Uber uniques.  but they won’t say what yet.
[4:12:22] 91Niki: Yep it is lol
[4:12:36] Wulfgrym: the pet is average, Rob is OP
[4:12:53] 91Niki: Just need 5 more chapter points, then I am done

[4:14:40] Broomba: chat : curious question - never played Death Stranding -- how long is it?
[4:14:42] deanbeo: 2 sec attack speed cat @thedippey
[4:14:49] PuppyTheDestroyer: I fired D4 back up and it only took a day and a half to get bored again.  It's just not my game.
[4:14:57] Jango_: @Broomba 40-50 without side content
[4:14:57] Wulfgrym: d4 team is sticking to a very bad philosophy for d4 and its going to hurt them till they learn
[4:15:05] Jango_: great game
[4:15:19] deanbeo: Ghost saber is good
[4:15:20] 91Niki: @Broomba Google says : When focusing on the main objectives, Death Stranding is about 40½ Hours in length. If you're a gamer that strives to see all aspects of the game, you are likely to spend around 113 Hours to obtain 100% completion.
[4:15:23] Verdell263: The step backwards from D3 to D4 is what is killing me
[4:15:24] Grunton: the seasons are just so small with like content in them
[4:15:26] Broomba: @Jango_ stick to main quest/story?
[4:15:36] jarilrpg: @Broomba really good website i use for finding the length of games https://howlongtobeat.com/game/38061

[6:43:18] Kneckt: i have 3 tiny scars from my appendix last year, recovery wasn't too bad but it deff was difficult for me for a few days

[7:36:12] Wulfgrym: sod is boomer friendly
[7:36:22] reggiepowa: well retail ain't shitty right now
[7:36:43] shuunno: classic is more fun imo because its more rewarding, and its not as stressful
[7:36:49] Wulfgrym: not m+ 20 complicated LUL
[7:36:53] safariheat1996: @reggiepowa  Depends on who you ask
[7:37:03] reggiepowa: alts are retail endgame right now

[7:45:37] invisibleboomer: Sir classic or lich king which is better?
[7:46:12] SinicalDev: WOTLK was the 'you think you do, but you dont' all along :)

[9:53:44] Phoxzy: I asked because I have the D3 Version3.0 card. Didn't know if it was worth anything.
[9:53:46] Ithylz: Mmmh since pirates attacked Forbidden Reach, maybe now they'll attack Amirdrassil (don't know why something like that could happen)
[9:53:50] devildriver1919: its gonna be burned by piratres

[9:54:16] Broomba: its the pirates of penance
[9:54:18] force_FMD: hockey is a weird trading, outside of big name rookies people dont bid on cards.  Like old hall of fame goalies are going less then the new cards
[9:54:26] HaxzorJimDuggan: pirates invading an island full of dragons sounds like a bad idea
[9:54:35] SinicalDev: maybe linked to the gnoll who disappears in the dungeon
[9:54:42] thunderphoenix83: hey
[9:54:49] Aidler: strange scenario.... but who knows
[9:54:51] PvtHudson093: James Franco was Harry Osbourne
[9:55:02] timmythegamertv: Wasn't one of the bronze dragons in that dungeon a "pirate" in costume, could it be something bronze dragon related..
[9:55:05] nocturnal_2195: @Towelliee what hockey Player is the card for?
[9:55:40] jkitchin75: it all means nothing
[9:55:41] Kneckt: u say it like besser
[9:55:52] coldhandsbeatz: the patch itself is quite strange. even knowing that it might be pirates, its kinda way different than the whole expansion

[9:56:35] snarkydonald: Probably Torey's family bidding. ngl
[9:57:18] Wulfgrym: LOL his mom
[9:57:20] Phoxzy: I tossed a pic in discord of the cards I pulled some recently.
[9:57:24] alluza: @Towelliee  do you think paladins will tank with 2h in phase 2 or was that just phase 1 fun
[9:57:26] nocturnal_2195: not a very good player
[9:57:32] Badd_Boi: @Towelliee look at this guy doing a 24 hr stream, when he should be grinding epack legendaries.
[9:57:32] PvtHudson093: BFA timewalking
[9:57:43] TheeCableguy: I mean 10.1.5 was huge in content. 10.2.5 was abysmally small so I hope 10.2.6 was the rest of that development time.
[9:58:11] nocturnal_2195: Now if were talking about a Connor Mcdavid thats a whole nother story
[9:58:12] Novirtue_: I am still unsure if I should get war within at all, would be the first expansion I miss, just doesn't feel like they're adding anything that amazing so far
[9:58:25] devildriver1919: we still have the timewalking pandemonium
[9:58:25] tlsmith3638: islands timewalking
[9:58:28] raldrik: 2-0 on last match of the AWC for the day. Hopefully we know something soon
[9:58:29] jkitchin75: but why make it this big of a deal out of it
[9:58:34] devildriver1919: coming up

[9:59:11] Theduskflyer: SOD is Hero ability testing
[9:59:17] PvtHudson093: But we always get Timewalking 2 expacs after its gone
[9:59:20] Ithylz: I think Blizz is hyping up 10.2.6 quite a bit so I hope it won't be just a small world event and nothing else but who knows
[9:59:22] Badd_Boi: Warbands is taking all my money. Gonna race changing all my alts.
[9:59:23] silentknight190: it will be a retail bomb but account wide stuff only appealing thing, I got burnt on DF after maxing one char
[9:59:30] HaxzorJimDuggan: chris metzen could sell me anything

[10:00:19] Novirtue_: diablo 4 just left such a sour taste that I'm really on the fence about it.
[10:00:22] tlsmith3638: wildstar evolve the genre and wee where it went
[10:00:43] Molvonos: Diablo 4.  Comparing an ARPG.  To a MMO expansion.
[10:00:44] Molvonos: HUh.
[10:00:53] Molvonos: I have to question the critical thinking there.
[10:00:59] TamaskaVT: A box on epack?
[10:01:02] maka94noctis: this entire arthas must be purged

[10:03:14] lifeintern: it failed
[10:03:18] sapicypapayaa: i always considered the garrison as housing
[10:03:24] Molvonos: Grated, Garrison wasn't housing.
[10:03:29] player2two: garrison was single player housing lol
[10:03:31] force_FMD: i liked my  garrison lol
