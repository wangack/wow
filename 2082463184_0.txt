[3:48:08] Phae__: Priest struggling into druid
[3:48:11] moses_otf: how is it playing death night
[3:48:13] larrydavidtherogue: brutal cleave there

[3:48:34] erydayjaximus: is frost dk any good these days
[3:48:47] jaayzcz: bro playlist's on fire🔥
[3:48:47] clymr: solid night. thanks Jim
[3:49:13] Arthyius: Dk's just fall over man and the dmg is never really threatening. a lot like Spriest, sure your topping the meters but nobody's really stressed about it
[3:49:16] Phae__: @erydayjaximus Can be in the right comp. UH is usually played though
[3:49:57] Phae__: Yeah, DKs just fall over to physical damage. Their defensives need a rework. Pact baseline could be huge.
[3:50:13] Phae__: Base death strike just feels so weak right now too
[3:50:58] Clush___: dk is trash in keys too all 3 specs honestly
[3:51:06] disasadi: just give back blood presence with extra armor :)
[3:51:33] xdslurpii: such a nice mog, wasted on a goblin
[3:51:38] origano8: ey yo whats this playlist bruh
[3:51:40] locombg: seems meh asf
[3:52:04] Skoorbals: I hate playing unholy feels clunky
[3:52:09] troniixlol: yea switch back to the other playlist imo
[3:52:21] origano8: @troniixlol nah this is so good wdym lol
[3:52:23] Phae__: Felt a lot stronger last season, imo. Defensives were still ass, but damage felt punchier. DK is just in a meh spot atm
[3:52:29] richardspencer95: frost is usually played with evo its got tons of kill potential on setups
[3:52:32] disasadi: i think disease build just lacks burst
[3:52:35] TimmyShoes: this is a nice lobby for the ele sham because there's so many pets to put flame shock on
[3:52:58] Phae__: Sham just huckin meatballs left and right. EZ wins
[3:53:05] FatalStrats: is ww any good these days? u played it recently?
[3:53:15] petkicklol: @disasadi ebon fever sucks plaguebringer is good though
[3:53:15] iFusion5194: GlitchCat GlitchCat GlitchCat GlitchCat GlitchCat GlitchCat GlitchCat
[3:53:17] Phae__: WW is good, yes
[3:53:28] ferahgok: @Phae__ I think all damage that isn't DH or Destro feels ass right now. It's because the pacing of the game is so much slower outside of those specs
[3:53:37] stonedboodah: big dam dk
[3:53:43] Clush___: i wish i was a cute anime girl AYAYA
[3:53:47] Clush___: oops wrong chat
[3:53:59] troniixlol: ayo?
[3:54:07] SatansHumbleGardenGnome: DHs are busted af but every other DPS seems fairly balanced
[3:54:13] stonedboodah: @Clush___ HUH
[3:54:20] Phae__: @ferahgok You're not wrong, hah. DK tier last season just helped create their burst with mastery stacking, so it felt pretty nasty when things aligned.
[3:54:49] selmodel: Yoo Pikaboo, how are u doing?
[3:54:50] larrydavidtherogue: tripod nooo
[3:54:50] disasadi: affli lock is just better version of unholy
[3:54:55] badjuice69: FallCry
[3:54:59] stonedboodah: cuz gore to good
[3:55:07] SatansHumbleGardenGnome: blame the healer that's how it usually goes
[3:55:12] Phae__: It's a DK problem, kekw
[3:55:19] disasadi: no he runs diff talent for sure, buffing sores
[3:55:22] barret784: apoc later
[3:55:22] saptoablind: 40min Q for 1 win GG!
