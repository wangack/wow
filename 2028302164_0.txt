[0:47:24] Ertra: was only about 4 inches of snow but it's a sloppy mess out there
[0:47:31] Wulfgrym: we got a good dump over night and we are for the first time this winter at -20c range
[0:47:34] Molvonos: We got a few feet
[0:48:02] Wulfgrym: never heard of snow days when we were kids
[0:48:28] Sollice: I saw that Ray Tracing and DLSS3 for D4 looked pretty good
[0:48:33] Outerlaw: it’s supposed to snow again tonight here in vegas
[0:48:34] BigFatAnimal: we got off because it was forecasted to snow and it never did. good day

[0:48:42] Wulfgrym: we used to sled off the roof of the house as kids the snow drifts were so high
[0:49:36] Wulfgrym: im not sure if i want to play d4 season 3 or not, having too much fun in sod
[0:50:29] Wulfgrym: @Sollice i had a problem with my oled monitor and I gotta say. for all the fun made of Dell, those guys replaced that monitor fast and the warranty process was so easy, super credit to them.

[0:51:52] Moobot: https://twitter.com/towelthetank/status/1743035635030691892
[0:53:12] Wulfgrym: @yeah i got the 34 inch ultra wide, tehre was a problem with the screen, so i got on their online support, worked with the support tech and they put in a replacement (dec 26th too) and got the replacement monitor jan 2nd.
[0:53:49] Wulfgrym: @Sollice replacement is working perfect, but overall i was impressed with their warranty service
[0:55:48] Sollice: I was going to get that monitor so many times but I never did. I probbaly should have but this year a lot of new oled tech coming out and the price coming down so I will probably switch back to an ultrawide

[5:29:34] devildriver1919: dispells were slow, and healers were asleep to damage that went out
[5:29:56] jinnchu: @kaykerrs always toxic smh xD

[5:31:35] TzgSplichO: @Towelliee "Nice day for fishing aint it?" :D :)
[5:31:35] Kaykerrs: druid healers are super nice to have
[5:31:40] Phayntt: yeah u just mass regen and arcane blast and people should never die to aoe dmg
[5:31:44] wonkabarss: the holy pally incendent of 2023
[5:31:45] Verdell263: Put me in coach, I have beacon!
[5:31:50] Molvonos: Honestly, when I healed that, I made sure to Mass Regen everyone going into phase 2, and then dropped living flame on the boss.
[5:31:54] Mecabeast: holy pallies are not in a good spot right now in this leveling bracket
[5:31:59] Molvonos: That alone keeps everyone up for a while.
[5:32:04] Molvonos: Regen is single target
[5:32:07] 3dRes: @TzgSplichO Hu Ha!
[5:32:08] Epicsapphire1988: theres a mass he didnt have
[5:32:08] Molvonos: Mass regen is group
[5:32:14] Epicsapphire1988: looks like
[5:32:17] Phayntt: idk how it shows up pon details
[5:32:18] Molvonos: Once you get Mass Regen, there's no real reason to use Regeneration.
[5:32:20] Shuttlelol: holy paladins are totally fine if you aren't wearing your pants on your head
[5:32:23] Molvonos: Same mana cost and everything
[5:32:32] NicStone8: regen is single target
[5:32:39] Noshpan: Mass Regen is one of the 3 runes I have left to acquire on my Mage
[5:32:42] NicStone8: but mass regen replaces living flame and large damage move
[5:32:56] Phayntt: if the mage had had regen on everyone people woudlnt of ticked down that fast
[5:33:08] supermaduro24: How do I the quest add on on season of discovery and classic
[5:33:14] Shuttlelol: @Molvonos not entirely true; regen is great combo'd with living flame
[5:33:37] wonkabarss: molv yelled at me and i didnt quit soo
