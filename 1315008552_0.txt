[3:58:47] gandalfthegrapettv: What are your thoughts on rescaling the entire world so there are effectively no levels and old items/ legendries and their content become relevant again? As opposed to each patch being a mini expansion kinda.

[4:02:24] gandalfthegrapettv: it seems like a better system, the content that blizzard works hard to make gets thrown in the trash essentially every patch. Seems like a shame to waste it. I wouldn't really be concerned with wether its like bdo or not. Just that the content already in the game is relevant. Would effectively kill content droughts for 95% of players.
