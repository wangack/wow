[1:06:14] Chrissingr: he's playing DA he's fine

[1:09:41] goodsorc: @Justflux but u dont use these on fortified?
[1:09:46] 0_____Kappa: thats always there i think Hmm
[1:09:53] 0_____Kappa: idk its weird
[1:10:13] 0_____Kappa: weird gimmick that just makes it annoying you have to scout every week
[1:10:24] Justflux: @goodsorc tbf I use same build cos I still focus on more ST on fort anyway, besides everbloom fort where I drop arbiter cos theres so much aoe
[1:10:34] 0_____Kappa: maybe there is a logical rule ppl havent figured out yet
[1:10:40] Justflux: I think rets should always try go more ST as thats the area they lack
[1:11:04] Kingcoconutcrab: @Justflux yeah I don't, it depends on what the group composition is, if we have padders, I go ST
[1:11:17] Kingcoconutcrab: that makes no sense @Justflux  you always base it on ur group comp
[1:11:30] goodsorc: started playing ret 2 weeks ago got the legendary yesterday lets gooo
[1:11:35] teghyy: what lvl key is popping?
[1:12:00] goodsorc: ret is more fun than enhance right now
[1:12:04] Justflux: @Kingcoconutcrab I hate doing low ST but yes, if I play with outlaw/mage I do go a bit more aoe but
[1:12:10] Justflux: I just hate being shit ST
[1:12:16] Sycraim: auto markers in pugs monkaW
[1:12:25] Kingcoconutcrab: @goodsorc stick with the basic M+ build, it's what Qrva does always :p
[1:12:31] Kingcoconutcrab: and look at him being top ret :p
[1:13:01] 0_____Kappa: Clueless
[1:13:21] Justflux: Qrva does go big overall aoe build cos of his comp tho
[1:13:30] cryonic805: get it for shield
[1:13:43] Kingcoconutcrab: yeah but if ur new to ret as he said he was, no point in min maxing talents, like just play :p
[1:13:47] Justflux: which is fine up to like 26/27 keys anyway
[1:13:51] Justflux: ye for sure
[1:13:59] blue321: Cause use ring for the gorgers
[1:14:01] katu1: ring is nice to stop the gorger jump
