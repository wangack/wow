[0:32:23] Traion: If leadership is lateral does the CEO get the same salary as me?
[0:32:23] Impurite: Top tier Corpa Clap
[0:32:24] Vinestra28: NOTED Going from a manager to Ceo is a lateral move. No pay increase got it
[0:32:26] OnePlayerPete: It kind of makes sense that WoW has suffered with this kind of incompetence.
[0:32:28] Krakatoa__: Dude needs to use his pronouns and man up
[0:32:29] BigBaadaaBoom: I‚Äôm at a company that also was shocked that I expected a pay increase with a promotion
[0:32:29] ChunkeyNinja: Jesus
[0:32:33] rudezki: this is so cruel
[0:32:33] Dranni21312: @Dranni21312 very sporadically they do work KEKL
[0:32:35] thorborg99: wholly fucking shit this hr
[0:32:39] Farthers: I doubt he saved his emails
[0:32:41] MeowgicTheCathering: all this is funny until you realize the same thing is happening to literally thousands of people in less glamorous companies Aware
[0:32:49] Riyshn: ... "You have 30sec to change that answer, before you lose an employee."
[0:32:55] MeowgicTheCathering: pepecry
[0:32:55] Neroniss_: time to reduce the CEO pay to the one of a regular worker
[0:33:00] redroniksre: Yep, literally just penny pinching companies trying to scam
[0:33:02] brucemalt: oh I saw this one. Fun.
[0:33:03] Dimortii: That is sadly very normal. In tech you do not go up in station or pay only responsibilities. If you want to move into higher positions you need to switch companies :(
[0:33:04] BigMightyena: Classic gaslighting
[0:33:07] rymed: Oh the gaslighting is beautiful
[0:33:08] aldric999999: blizz probably deleted all already. if this guy didn't print the emails out
[0:33:09] rudezki: no war but the class war
[0:33:09] Geri_0123: at my company they don't give a raise to newly promoted managers, only next year

[0:33:23] Meckes: this sounds like a huge scandal in the making
[0:33:27] one_mae_bee: i hope this person lawyers up because hohohoooo that's a payout even in the uk i'm sure
[0:33:30] ravenofjudgement: HR checked that HR did nothing wrong
[0:33:30] Impurite: @Dimortii That's exactly correct, never stay more than 2 years max.

[0:33:45] DukePiewalker: I call BS

[0:34:07] smartm07: you dont need energy, you just send it to a lawyer
[0:34:12] Rhekkar: No energy became he now can't pay his energy bill KEKL
[0:34:13] alwiro: nonononono, putting out work-eamils is the absolute fucking dumbest move you can do
[0:34:13] UniqeornRider: that makes it sus af
[0:34:27] manthelazy: something is wrong bcs no evidance -> 100 lie
[0:34:28] alwiro: you CANNOT put out emails of a billion dollar company
[0:34:28] LickingWay: at that point i'd have punched someone
[0:34:28] aldric999999: @OspreyRed yes true...
[0:34:32] ppphenom: why is he crying about a non-compete clause that's in his contract that he signed
[0:34:35] rudezki: NotLikeThis
[0:34:44] EeraGames: "That sucks for you then Blizz :) "
[0:34:52] BigBaadaaBoom: but your experience is in that industry
[0:35:00] Traion: Yeah non-competes work like that
[0:35:01] OnePlayerPete: Is this a real guy?
[0:35:13] zuzua90: just don‚Äôt sign anything until they promote you
[0:35:16] rudezki: Corpa take pleasure in fucking people
[0:35:16] UniqeornRider: yeah, it's usually for the same industry
[0:35:19] blessedIgnorant: Should be on gardening leave and they have to adhere to UK law
[0:35:21] Chaoyang399: Non competes you can just tell them to pound sand if you want tbqh
[0:35:29] sstarfall_: probably US thing KKona
[0:35:34] Plinglebob: He's an idiot or a liar
[0:35:35] MeowgicTheCathering: :)
[0:35:36] ChunkeyNinja: Yep uk its legal for up to 3 months
[0:35:39] blessedIgnorant: What contract?
[0:35:39] yomiffxiv: :)
[0:35:41] Dranni21312: Non-competes in the US are also field-related
[0:35:41] rudezki: :=
[0:35:42] fero1701: they have to pay you gardeners leave in UK
[0:35:42] Ethuci: Sounds fake tbh
[0:35:42] countrycount: @Preachlfw that makes no sense, if his lead role was never in writing they can't activate a non-compete that apparently was never in writing either?...or am missing something
[0:35:45] Miss_Kas: :)
[0:35:45] viczz88: KKona ITSALL ON YOU BRO!!!!
[0:35:47] MitsuAmariyo: I mean, EU/UK laws are way more pro-employee, no?
[0:35:47] TwitchViewRobot: Well effectivly, people build their homes and lives around their income, he could get a job with mcdonalds but thats about it LUL
[0:35:49] rymed: This sounds a bit hollywood now lol
[0:35:49] BigKobalt: am i wrong for thinking this is sus
[0:35:50] coral_k_: Susge
[0:35:50] HeffaBear: this is so fake

[0:35:52] alwiro: :)
[0:35:52] Dernsby: This is sounding a bit more sketchy tbh.
[0:35:53] Yatak1000: Just earn more money lol :)
[0:35:53] manthelazy: ok...someone is lying here
[0:35:53] Umseslad: :)
[0:35:55] DaddyKeevo: yet wont release proof?
[0:35:56] ktownchef: wouldn't that contract have his raise and things on it
[0:35:56] forevrzero: ok, this sounds super sus now
[0:35:56] Cubick23: Need to stop believing twitter users tbh
[0:35:57] one_mae_bee: the contract that said position X is my duties, not this leadership contract that i never got?
[0:35:59] DaddyKeevo: i dunno man
[0:36:00] Tubbybaggins: this feels like a nightmare movie sequence
[0:36:01] Traion: This is very sus
[0:36:01] ktownchef: whatever they negotiated
[0:36:02] Neroniss_: yeah, that sounds illegal even if it is in contract
[0:36:06] Neverlast: here in australia it's really hard for companies to do non-competes. They have to prove that you're taking business information to a new company. It can't be used punitively
[0:36:07] AdamlovesCoffee: yeah I'm not buying it, great story though
[0:36:11] OspreyRed: this feels exaggerated a bit
[0:36:13] UniqeornRider: his story is starting to fall apart real quick
[0:36:13] Rhekkar: :) capitalism fucks everyone in the ass
[0:36:15] one_mae_bee: oh no, this is totally believable.
[0:36:15] Lissard: They said smile Madge
[0:36:20] fearcxnt: sry but this sounds like BS
[0:36:20] majkos: He might have added to much fluff to this
[0:36:21] oriekz: so there was a contract but HR didnt know about it?
[0:36:28] The_Forsaken_Lord: surely if this is real no-one can be this naive
[0:36:29] Wodiin: I think this is drama time embellished a little me thinks. I think it happened but not this dramatic.
[0:36:31] Jarraxx: anywhere at all is bs, in a competing business, sure
[0:36:32] rymed: Yeah I've lost complete faith in the tale lol
[0:36:33] kaspiDev: Maybe Sus, but lawyers would bust his ass if he published the e-mails? So he noped himself out of it?
[0:36:34] BlindOwlInTree: it looks like somebody didnt read their contract
[0:36:36] zuzua90: non compete would have to be in his employee handbook unless he signed something and he didn‚Äôt tell us
[0:36:38] rudezki: corporations have our best interests at heart, trust me bro!
[0:36:38] Yatak1000: A smile better suits a leader :)
[0:36:39] sinclsw23: NEVER underestimate hubris and stupidity
[0:36:39] aldric999999: this is obviously spoken not written. could realy be said by a guy, just not recorded down.
[0:36:49] Marach: This feels like a "well they didn't say that exactly but it's what they meant"
[0:36:50] VallanceHeals: Cheer100 I mean, he has to post some evidence at least because this comes across bordering on potential defamation.
[0:36:53] Decaped: All HR knew they were leaving with the merger. They give no fucks
[0:36:57] Impurite: @countrycount until last year when non-competes were basically effectively anulled in america under most situations yes they could. You'd have to be able to afford to fight them in american court which is very friendly to that stupid crap.
[0:36:58] Juzika031: Contracts that prevent you from working are ILLEGAL in most places, companies make you sign it but it never stands up in court
[0:37:00] Dagraine: it is little sus
[0:37:01] knukles0: it feels like a drama time story, a bit over the top and need the other side or some proof
[0:37:04] DaddyKeevo: im calliing shennanigans
[0:37:09] smartm07: no no, blizzard DID do the right thing... for blizzard.
[0:37:11] DJDigiUK: people always add some bias in their stories Shruge
[0:37:13] ChrisHuge: This feels kinda sus, HR teams aren't actively evil, they do what's in the companies best interest. Doing this feels like it's cartoonishly evil and NOT in the companies best interests
[0:37:14] KelticNight: @Preachlfw https://twitter.com/NotSoLittleC/status/1755716945951789252
[0:37:15] countrycount: @Impurite huh...good to know thanks!
[0:37:22] Chewmii: Evilge
[0:37:22] truezarosian: stuff in America is bad, but THIS bad? seems suspcious
[0:37:23] Dranni21312: US companies *ARE* disney villains tho Shruge
[0:37:25] Boxer502: @Preachlfw When I lost my job at Epic, it IS OVER that quickly, but that is more removing a possible security risk. Which I kinda get.
[0:37:27] alwiro: again...you CANNOT post buisness/office emails of a billion dollar company.
[0:37:28] rymed: yeah, disney villain is dead on
[0:37:30] Hypojamy: yeah but they were on the company emails
[0:37:31] zukohonor: isnt that what blizzard basically been forever, a disney villian
[0:37:32] MeowgicTheCathering: this seems like a KIV angle till more info comes out Hmm
[0:37:34] Krakatoa__: Blizzard = Scrouge  before xmas
[0:37:46] AngelL0ls: I mean is it hard to believe when its Blizzard? Legit one o the worst places ever ü§î
[0:37:53] Impurite: @truezarosian i"m sorry to tell you this but it's usually worse.
[0:37:53] Wodiin: I meeeeeeeaaaan blizz was union busting and doing some horrible shit soooo already kinda disney villain shit.
[0:37:56] EeraGames: I mean if you look at things that we have from Blizz like the breast milk stuff, that felt insane but it happened. I wouldn't doubt this was sort of a thing. But he did say he was locked out of slack and emails by HR.
[0:38:02] OnePlayerPete: The guy sells 'mentorship' sessions, I'm not sure I trust his skills after this.
[0:38:12] Nifona: okay but who has the money for sueing?
[0:38:13] Ractorious: "Good days are just around the corner"
[0:38:21] alwiro: sure thing, have fun sueing blizzard KEKW
[0:38:22] manthelazy: @AngelL0ls maybe but surly not everything what the guy writen without any evidance
[0:38:22] smartm07: Cheer100 all he had to do was send any of this to a lawyer and then sit back and wait.
[0:38:23] BlindOwlInTree: its publicly traded US company he should know better, if its not on paper it is not going to happen
[0:38:23] Wodiin: At will employment?
[0:38:24] NeverNotSure: if this was real/had evidence, this would not be on twitter and would in court
[0:38:27] epicspacebears: @Mudcrab89 if you stirr shit like this you have to back it up
[0:38:27] Hypojamy: He probably don't have access to those emails anymore
[0:38:28] Cubick23: I don't believe things on twitter
[0:38:45] Farthers: It sounds like he was naive and didnt save any of his work emails before being cutoff.
[0:38:46] IceBurg85: if its real, it probably in his work emails that he cant access anymore
[0:38:47] countrycount: you get a lawyer that gets paid in the payment from the court
[0:38:47] alwiro: in america? yeah good luck with clear cut cases
[0:38:47] OspreyRed: @Wodiin "at will" is the standard here
[0:38:51] Riuujin_: my guess he used blizzard mail for it and can no longer access it if its real
[0:38:53] smartm07: any decentr lawyer would jizz themself over this
[0:38:55] DukePiewalker: A lot of lawyers take payment at the end of a lawsuit if its 100%.
[0:38:57] Nifona: just for argument sake - if he lost access to the email how he can proof? Is it valid if he saves down the emails in time?
[0:39:03] SoulSlicer808: its at will employment and the employment contract moves all disputes to arbitration instead of state courts
[0:39:05] P4rappa: Young and naive exploitable fool gets exploited. He'll get replaced by the next one.
[0:39:07] Impurite: @IceBurg85 and he could've been sued for trying to download them outside of their system too.
[0:39:11] zukohonor: i believe blizzard is 100% this evil lmao
[0:39:16] Nbcal8: In the US the company can lie to you, its not illegal unfortunately.
[0:39:23] Adaire3: I don't believe this is 100% of the story, I can see how some of it could be but even the non-compete clause has workarounds. It's not like he won't be able to find a job at all
[0:39:29] LostEwok: He's in uk though right? don't see how us law is relevant
[0:39:35] Hypojamy: They were on the blizzard email system though
[0:39:37] Yatak1000: Shaggy defence "wasn't me".
[0:39:38] EeraGames: You could say you want to see the... Papers,please? Kappa
[0:39:39] Impurite: @IceBurg85 you can still do it and if the malfeasance is big enough you can still win but you're taking that risk.
[0:39:39] knukles0: if the emails are as clear as he has made out, then this would be as clear a case as possible
[0:39:40] Brandilath: I mean you would have thought the car trouble was a strong case and yet.
[0:39:41] brucemalt: @zukohonor yeah... me too. LUL
[0:39:48] The_Forsaken_Lord: he still claims to have proof though so would be a 100% win, just seems super sussy
[0:39:48] Methuzahla: SAME
[0:39:50] Enoz___: wouldn't it be a US court? I would trust any case no matter how good to go well there
[0:39:57] Enoz___: wouldn't*
[0:40:20] Adaire3: @enoz if there's paper trail to back up his story, and you ask for a jury trial, blizzard would be screwed. Everyone hates big corps
[0:40:21] ChrisHuge: I got 'promoted' to manager at my company in charge of a fairly big team, I'm on the same salary as some of my staff, so I relate there...
[0:40:52] Methuzahla: I was made a Med Sec for 5 consultants at a private hospital from a filing clerk. Got told I'll be promoted... never happened. I was paid literally ¬£6.50 an hour
[0:41:08] MeowgicTheCathering: all this is just the end stage of the society we have Shruge cant say im too surprised
[0:41:10] SoulSlicer808: same here, I got promoted to software manager and one of my direct reports made more than I did
[0:41:13] Impurite: @ChrisHuge Use the title change to get a job with the equivalent pay, no title change use the experience for the same.
[0:41:14] Krakatoa__: not so little anymore!!
[0:41:18] BlindOwlInTree: i had to quit and join back to get 100% increase but when i asked for it to happen during the tenure they said f** off
[0:41:19] ChrisHuge: Big companies = bloated/delayed HR processes, our pay reviews can ONLY happen once a year, even if they cocked it up
[0:41:21] sebnificant: I've definitely had sneering replies from outright vindictive HR when they haven't come through on their side in a similar situation.
[0:41:23] Boxer502: @Preachlfw As someone on the younger side, it's really depressing seeing this happen ( even if this isn't 100% true ) to find a good, long-lasting career. It just feels impossible, y'know?
[0:41:24] zukohonor: its like they try to make their games actively worse
[0:41:27] Decadence001: @Preachlfw it's not so different to my experience in the NHS, except the motivation for remaining is obviously different, but it's the same type of exploitation by management to get more work for same/less resources
[0:41:29] DJDigiUK: yep that happened to me in my last place, moving to training manager with minor salary increase before realiisng i was underpaid industry wise
[0:41:32] countrycount: @Preachlfw 2-3 years actually xD
[0:41:33] Sunshine_Eu: When i was on maternity pay the company i worked for restructured the company and i lost my job but they gave others the opportunity to reapply for same job just different role title
[0:41:37] ChrisHuge: @Impurite Tis my current plan
[0:41:37] Brandilath: Reme
[0:41:39] Traion: Hear that Bex? Time to quit PG! Kappa
[0:41:42] Methuzahla: D: I dont wanna leave PG
[0:41:49] Impurite: @ChrisHuge Clap
[0:41:53] Neverlast: getting a new job ends up getting you a bigger pay rise than waiting for a promotion
[0:42:00] echo319: Espesially in Tech you should be looking every 18-24 months IMO
[0:42:01] majkos: @Methuzahla you will be missed Sadge
[0:42:02] countrycount: @Methuzahla but your boss told you it is better for you! XD
[0:42:04] Lionheartex: A company I worked for told me to move to Germany and they'd give me a job. After 8 months of waiting for the visa they told me they couldn't afford it anymore :)
[0:42:07] Jauffre_: Depends a lot on the company, I've been at my place a long time because they look after me
[0:42:15] Phabey: @ChrisHuge same at a huge multinational, pay reviews do not happen outside of year-end, under any circumstances. No negotiation, no arguing
[0:42:15] Zziggz: Is that Bex and Chris getting sacked then? :o
[0:42:16] Shelana95: @Methuzahla you hearrd the man
[0:42:18] EeraGames: Yeah I'd be much better off in my career if I had jumped around regularly
[0:42:24] Chewmii: OW3 Pog
[0:42:25] Brandilath: Remember kids: Companies do not reward loyalty. Always be on the lookout for outside opportunities.
[0:42:27] realnzall: @Preachlfw As someone with a mental disability, the thought of having to change employer every 5 years is problematic at best. Especially since here in Belgium wages are legally mandated to keep pace with inflation
[0:42:27] JakeZGR: @methuzahla I can offer you a promotion if you agree on the hug amount >:3 mopBad
[0:42:30] Maddroxv: ow yeh I got promoted to a "supervising"position and  never got a pay increase, immediately said  "fuck it" and quit
[0:42:32] DukePiewalker: Might be true but it seems to be an embellished story to say the least.
[0:42:38] AngryFil: nah there ain't no crossover
[0:42:41] JakeZGR: @realnzall mopHug
[0:42:42] zuzua90: only non compete clause I‚Äôve seen said if you work a second job with a competitor you had three months to pick what job you wanted
[0:42:45] Chaoyang399: @Preachlfw I mean its the same with Square, each CBU works independently there somewhat
[0:42:46] kaspiDev: I was extremely lucky and extremely careful. I had my lead role signed in contract with the wage update before I started on it from "just" developer. I did burn out, but that is a different story.
[0:42:47] LasyPanda: @Preachlfw If you want to see how OW is shambless look at the patch they posted today that coming to the game
[0:42:52] ThrashLisaro75: I left my previous role as they promoted people above me with less experience and knowledge because an algorithm said so, but wouldnt show their working out and shut down all talk of it and it became a taboo subject - companies are horrible!

[0:43:29] AngryFil: i work at Ubisoft and i have no fucking clue what's going on with projects that aren't my own
[0:43:31] DukePiewalker: D4 might be a disappointment but its 100% earning them money
[0:43:35] Christephoff: diablo 4 monkaS

[0:43:39] Gilgamesh1983: Good morning

[0:43:41] rymed: Does feel like Blizz is going all in with WoW now
[0:43:44] countrycount: @kurki666 that is delusional sry xD

[0:43:48] OspreyRed: i agree with you NODDERS
[0:43:48] Teh_Gaffer: Diablo 4 is doing extremely well, it's making fuck tons of money for the shareholders' quarterly goals
[0:43:49] Vinestra28: NODDERS receipts be needed
[0:43:49] maglajz: some of it is sus
[0:43:49] Mencontar: valid ask
[0:43:49] ravenofjudgement: always proof NODDERS
[0:43:49] aki_mattis: Nah, need proof
[0:43:50] DukePiewalker: 100% needs proof
[0:43:51] Traion: Yeah some of this seems sus
[0:43:51] MitsuAmariyo: NODDERS
[0:43:52] NeverNotSure: nah, need proof
[0:43:52] Miss_Kas: Yeah it feels exaggerated for sure
[0:43:52] zukohonor: idk, sounds like blizz
[0:43:52] Enoz___: https://twitter.com/NotSoLittleC/status/1755716945951789252
[0:43:52] Hupu_a: proof or its just slander
[0:43:52] sebnificant: Sounds like HR to me
[0:43:53] truezarosian: never trust anything on twitter
[0:43:53] SpiderXIV: I agree
[0:43:55] Philbobaggins12: @Preachlfw Are you going to go back to GW2 CMs? The crawlers got Dhuum CM down last night! :)
[0:43:55] Braggardt: Not at all, this needs proof
[0:43:55] Christephoff: NODDERS  NODDERS NODDERS
[0:43:56] ktownchef: Nothing wrong with asking for proof. It's called due process.
[0:43:57] KaiZen2048: Valid ask
[0:43:57] LasyPanda: @Preachlfw They can Sue him for leaking Work mails
[0:43:57] zelleren: NOPERS need proof always
[0:43:58] EeraGames: It's PROBABLY right or at least partially right, but I'd like receipts NODDERS
[0:43:58] Adaire3: some of it is overdramatized and tilted, others is believable but needs proof
[0:43:58] daris888: always proof
[0:43:58] Dimortii: Yes all things Twitter needs proof or it's just fabrication @Preachlfw
[0:43:59] HeffaBear: nah that guys full of shit or niave
[0:43:59] brucemalt: Yeah, proof would be nice.
[0:43:59] Makrar: he probably didnt take any proof and then got locked out
[0:44:00] JakeZGR: @methuzahla mopHug
[0:44:00] MeowgicTheCathering: agree with the sentiment but need clarification on details NODDERS
[0:44:02] manthelazy: 100% need to see the proof
[0:44:02] Shrandamar: aye, just hearsay
[0:44:02] Polebegood: i think it's necessary if he wants another job in the AAA industry after this
[0:44:03] rymed: Absolutely. It got silly quick, ridiculous at the end.
[0:44:04] KelticNight: he said in a tweet he doesn't want to leave himself open to libe/defemation lawsuits
[0:44:07] kaspiDev: He can't post proof. Or needs to censor it meticulously.
[0:44:09] Phabey: I don't think Blizz deserve any benefit of the doubt
[0:44:13] Vinestra28: its up there with: and then bobby kottick called me up and shot my dog infront of me levels of.. AITA
[0:44:13] Dragonnan_Drakelos: https://twitter.com/NotSoLittleC/status/1755716945951789252
[0:44:14] Methuzahla: @JakeZGR <3 :D
[0:44:14] Lithirrdys: proof is hard when you gett insta-locked out of the emails/slack though, and in the moment you aren't thinking about the "after"
[0:44:21] Decadence001: always proof, i agree. It might make no difference in the end, but the receipts are needd
[0:44:23] The_Forsaken_Lord: I got screwed over before with a promised promotion, as I didn't have the ability to leave at the time i changed my role horizontally, instead of going up. turned out i was invaluable to the department so they ended up paying me much more than i would have done with the promotion. I left a year later
[0:44:25] knukles0: yeah it is so much that it has to be a lawsuit if there is proof
[0:44:27] ChrisHuge: Totally agree - Some of this stuff is HR opening themselves up to massive liability. I've got no doubt the dude was treated poorly, but some of it feels overstated.
[0:44:27] UbiNax: @Preachlfw But wouldn't there be issues with releasing internal mails in public? not sure how the rules are over there.
[0:44:28] Brandilath: There's some obvious dramatization but the core concept is very likely true.
[0:44:28] Ractorious: Need proof but I wouldn't be surprised if this is real cuz it's blizzard
[0:44:32] smartm07: I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs accurate in broad strokes, but the wording he uses are very suspect
[0:44:33] alwiro: at the same time if you would want to sue you cannot post evidence
[0:44:35] countrycount: @Lithirrdys he has proof..according to himself
[0:44:42] VoxInSox23: @preachlfw I agree with you but Blizzard has lost the benefit of the doubt
[0:44:56] realnzall: @Preachlfw Since we're doing reactions: thoughts on PETA fighting for the rights of animals on carousels? https://thehill.com/homenews/state-watch/4454176-peta-targets-kansas-company-over-carousels-with-animal-designs/
[0:45:01] countrycount: yeah but like he is also saying HR ignored him but also talked to him
[0:45:05] zuzua90: what promotion ??? :)
[0:45:19] EeraGames: He has said he has emails but doesn't want to get into it with lawsuits etc
[0:45:23] pacegod: They could record it, doesnt mean he got a copy.
[0:45:29] EeraGames: And yeah Blizzard doesn't have benefit of the doubt anymore NODDERS
[0:45:30] DzikiWegorz1223: I think it's dangerous assumption
[0:45:38] Nifona: this is sadly typical HR behaviour in big companies
[0:45:38] rymed: https://twitter.com/NotSoLittleC/status/1755716945951789252 - his reason why he didn't name
[0:45:41] Jauffre_: @realnzall WTF KEKW
[0:45:46] majkos: I think he changed some HR corpo lines that are safe for blizzard into what they really meant while venting
[0:45:46] OspreyRed: agree with preach, i dont blindly believe every story
[0:45:49] maglajz: yeah, not trusting blizzard does not mean I will trust everyone who goes against them
[0:45:51] lingonbarry: Mike can we get HR meeting stream
[0:45:55] braskal: I'm the first one to call Blizz out on their shit but this seems fishy
[0:45:57] AltCoby: AltCoby subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 37 months! 
[0:46:05] Maddroxv: I mean i've heard other horror stories about blizz HR from gross incompetence to them just being a screen for Blizz cause they're surely not there for the employees
[0:46:06] VallanceHeals: The thing is, his reason for not naming the people doesn't answer why he doesn't just post the evidence with the names redacted.
[0:46:07] Decaped: Yeah, gotta make the business decision
[0:46:19] dontlookatme987: Bored now.
[0:46:20] nautilus_jiv: strong agree with preach here
[0:46:21] alwiro: "some" KEKW
[0:46:23] Rhekkar: I don't think it's extreme at all considering their past behaviour

[0:46:26] MortiousPrime: @Maddroxv HR is NEVER there for the employees. HR is there for the company
[0:46:26] manthelazy: exactly that, if he has evidance he can post and thenn we see the proof then we have
[0:46:26] JakeZGR: @vallanceheals mopHug
[0:46:34] echo319: Bad decisions in the creation of World of Warcraft does not mean they are disney level evil HR
[0:46:37] BigMightyena: @MortiousPrime NODDERS
[0:46:38] VallanceHeals: @JakeZGR Jakie! :)
[0:46:40] ThrashLisaro75: also if he didnt have the energy to deal with it why did he have the energy to post this!
[0:46:41] chomicze89: you're talking about a company in which employees cause another one to kill herself and bobby tried to cover it
[0:46:51] GooseComics: Posting a screen shot takes like 2-3 clicks....
[0:46:53] Sunshine_Eu: i dont doubt there will be some element of truth in this but agree need proof
[0:46:53] andavaar: you really need to find the energy to post those emails
[0:46:55] SpectraBG: @Preachlfw there's something about thank you for purchasing my X is raising alarms
[0:46:56] MagmaScythe: how do you have the energy to do this many tweets, but not the receipts?
[0:46:57] Amyrantha_: @Preachlfw maybe he can't access his proof anymore because blizzard shut down his access to his email/slack?
[0:46:58] rymed: Says he fears defamation, slander and libel lawsuits
[0:47:00] KelticNight: he said he doesn't want to leave himself open to lawsuits by individuals involved
[0:47:02] manthelazy: not like "I hate blizzard even without proof I know its them"
[0:47:02] TastefulBackshots: How does he have the energy to post 30 tweets but no receipts?
[0:47:11] countrycount: @Amyrantha_ he says he has proof himself
[0:47:15] Xythana: did he say he got locked out of the accounts?
[0:47:16] JakeZGR: @manthelazy mopHug
[0:47:17] EeraGames: It's less that we give Blizzard 0%, we just shift the scales to be 40:60% as a starting point given history imo
[0:47:18] majkos: Also, Blizz bad but this could easly take place in any corpo
[0:47:19] knukles0: I do think he did get taken for a bit of ride, but I dont think there was the level of disney villian he makes out
[0:47:26] Ractorious: How would he have proof after leaving the company though?
[0:47:27] manthelazy: @JakeZGR <3
[0:47:30] nautilus_jiv: I run a department of people and speak with HR on this kind of thing regularly. no way this holds up without it in writing
[0:47:31] Maddroxv: @MortiousPrime doesn't mean if employees go to HR with serious complaints they shouldn't be taken seriously nor handled properly
[0:47:34] Enoz___: @Preachlfw https://twitter.com/NotSoLittleC/status/1755716945951789252 why he isn't posting it.
[0:47:50] bluedyedrose: have the energy to post a twitter essay but not any for any information backing himself up Cheer100
[0:47:51] VoxInSox23: @preachlfw  I‚Äôm not saying take him blindly at his word.  But my pendulum of belief is at  51/49 in his favor.  Until shown otherwise
[0:47:58] rymed: BS
[0:48:01] MrZxorm: If he was instantly locked out of emails/slack he may not have the releveent screencaps
[0:48:02] ravenofjudgement: 'murica Classic
[0:48:08] kota_adin: big Bs
[0:48:10] Sunshine_Eu: America has really bad support for employees
[0:48:13] Adaire3: California is an at will state where employment can be terminated be either party
[0:48:13] Teh_Gaffer: Corpa Well, it's not specifically "illegal"
[0:48:18] grimgorgri: KEK
[0:48:18] Vehlin: America, land of the freedom to screw your employees
[0:48:19] Adaire3: with no notice
[0:48:20] EeraGames: D: YOU'RE NOT?!
[0:48:22] blessedIgnorant: It would be UK law
[0:48:22] KelticNight: US employment law is monkaSHAKE
[0:48:27] MortiousPrime: @Maddroxv You're absolutely right, but whenever you approach HR, you should have the mentality that they are there to help the company first, employee second
[0:48:30] kaspiDev: pgeBlind he will never see the link to why he isn't posting it
[0:48:32] Maddroxv: US law is "get fucked" if you don't have a union
[0:48:33] MeowgicTheCathering: US law PepeLaugh more of guidelines
[0:48:35] Marach: Also UK employment law would apply...
[0:48:38] LickingWay: its a lateral move m8
[0:48:38] DukePiewalker: This does not add up.
[0:48:40] blessedIgnorant: He's a UK employee so US law is irrelevant
[0:48:40] KyriaTheMystic: You absolutely can.
[0:48:41] rymed: Tbf, neither am I. But you can't tell someone a promotions gives X and then never provide X. Surely
[0:48:41] TheZander: furthermore, UK law overrides that in this case because he is residing in the UK
[0:48:41] Ractorious: Cuz I lost my access to my company email the moment I left my previous company
[0:48:42] Traion: US loves its "at-will" employment laws
[0:48:43] alwiro: @Preachlfw at least over here i CANNOT publically put out a work email without risking getting sued. period
[0:48:45] andavaar: @kaspiDev he saw it earlier
[0:48:50] meercatsdot: surely it should be the law of the country you are working in??
[0:48:52] Dimortii: No there is no protection against it. He didn't sign a contract for a new position therefor Blizzard is not liable
[0:48:53] zuzua90: @preachlfw corporations pay lobbyists to bribe politicians the rich make the laws
[0:48:54] Methuzahla: https://twitter.com/NotSoLittleC/status/1755716945951789252
[0:48:54] Plinglebob: If hes a uk employee uk employment law may apply
[0:48:57] TulkasStream: Lovely first few weeks for Johanna it seems.
[0:48:57] HeffaBear: didnt he say he sells seminars and coaching? what if its for publicity?
[0:49:01] Decaped: Even if preach believed him 100%, the preach business shouldn't talk shit about business partners
[0:49:06] knukles0: he is living and working in the Uk, it is Uk law that needs to be followed
[0:49:08] Brandilath: I assume it was never stated so explicitly. Just enough vagueness to lead him on.
[0:49:11] lilleyspark: wasn't he working in the uk so wouldn't uk law apply
[0:49:21] KYANGOz: Some States like mine (Wyoming) can fire you for anything, they don't even have to have a reason. Even if they said you were getting a promotion.
[0:49:23] Phabey: people are being willfully obtuse with the 'but he had energy to post the tweets stuff' comments. He CLEARLY means he doesn't want to deal with the fallout of calling out specific people.

[0:49:24] sstarfall_: Tifa trending Looking
[0:49:35] EeraGames: @sstarfall_ Looking
[0:49:37] alwiro: @knukles0 and i am very sure that all over europe you cannot publically post internatl email affairs of any company
[0:49:39] nautilus_jiv: I understand this person not wanting to openly publish the emails as its dangerous from a data protection stance but why on God's green earth has this person not layered up
[0:49:46] Polebegood: Susge
[0:49:46] Mangobanana_: Yeah, anything explicitly promised or established in writing are the terms of agreement. @Preachlfw
[0:49:49] samaxis: Its complicated, but general rule of thumb that uinless you actually got the payraise/promottion you dont have it. Doing the extra work with no actual contract set in ink is on him unfortuatly
[0:49:50] Mezegis_Yo: Susge
[0:49:50] Nbcal8: HEy Preach I work in the US and have been in like 3 unions, it is not illegal to lie to employees about pay/promotions. It only reaches illegality when there's a breach of contract.
[0:49:53] Nifona: @lilleyspark it depends on where the contracting entity is. If he made a contract with a UK entity, then UK law
[0:49:54] knukles0: it cant be slander or libel if its true
[0:49:55] viczz88: Susge
[0:49:56] fripple4: eh, people with money will still use lawfare on the grounds that 'you could figure it out'
[0:49:58] Traion: Defamation is a false statement. Posting an email can't be defamation
[0:50:01] Phil246: Truth is an absolute defence to libel,  if has evidence or can't be libel

[0:50:11] durincort: People sue over every little thing here
[0:50:11] rymed: Yeah I'm believing this less and less
[0:50:14] Neroniss_: can still be sued for it in US
[0:50:14] Atreyu_Lavellan: Yeah that's a bit odd
[0:50:16] DukePiewalker: Again this just doesnt add up
[0:50:16] Wodiin: Me thinks someone embellished the truth.
[0:50:17] andavaar: defamation is if you dont post the proof right?
[0:50:19] Brandilath: Man is just tired and wanted to vent. I can relate.
[0:50:20] LasyPanda: You cant leak Work Mail, the will take hes ass to the bank @Preachlfw
[0:50:21] pacegod: He may have been advised by lawyers not to post them
[0:50:24] Rose_Silvers: it doesn't have to be true, you just have to bury them in legal fees for defamtion
[0:50:25] kaspiDev: You can still get sued for it even if it isn't...
[0:50:26] Rhekkar: US laws PepeLaugh
[0:50:26] fripple4: the point isn't to win, it's to bankrupt the person they want to silence
[0:50:29] samaxis: because there is no garantee its "real" could be edited. Proof has to be proven

[0:50:33] pacegod: you are not lawyers
[0:50:36] grandmole933: @Preachlfw  dosn't stop the army of lawyers filing to get you to stop, the you have to go through the fight
[0:50:37] Ethuci: He's just trying to start shit because bliz = bad Smadge
[0:50:38] viczz88: cant believe you , dude, unless you got receipts
[0:50:39] nautilus_jiv: he said he's based in the UK ergo he's covered by our British system. top hats and wigs for all
[0:50:39] turtleandfish: its murica
[0:50:40] MrPickleGB: Posting without proof is more defamation right???
[0:50:44] Nifona: but isn't his emails are actually company property?
[0:50:44] alwiro: @Preachlfw in germany you CANNOT publically put out work emails. you WILL get sued
[0:50:44] Lorren_19: Shruge
[0:50:46] Hupu_a: Sadge no money for actual lawyer
[0:50:49] knukles0: I am sorry I dont want to think he is lying, but his arguments feel really bad
[0:50:50] Phabey: they'd still countersue thefuck out of him
[0:50:51] Ractorious: Fear of blizzard counter-suing him?
[0:50:52] NevikLink: More of that they might sue him
[0:50:54] VoxInSox23: @pacegod I am
[0:50:54] zuzua90: they wouldn‚Äôt sue him they‚Äôd get it taken down and slap him with a cease and desist
[0:50:56] viczz88: Shruge
[0:50:57] braskal: Calling bullshit on this
[0:51:00] LickingWay: 100%
[0:51:02] grandmole933: @Preachlfw  dosn't stop the army of lawyers filing to get you to stop, the you have to go through the fight. adn taht is costly to do
[0:51:04] Dimortii: It is yes
[0:51:04] Nines713: Has he found second lawyer?
[0:51:04] countrycount: yeah we have labour laws
[0:51:06] aldric999999: think he just doesn't want to deal with law suits. blizz has enough money to crush you long enough that he goes bankrupt
[0:51:08] eightfold999: too poor for lawer Sadge
[0:51:11] braskal: Yes we do
[0:51:12] VallanceHeals: I mean, the reality is that this is already potential defamation.
[0:51:14] ravenofjudgement: in Germany Union would kill blizzard KEKW
[0:51:15] ArchonRahal: Defemation and Libel needs you to prove you suffered an actual loss. A lot of the time people will threaten it because they know the other party can't afford the legal fees
[0:51:15] TwitchViewRobot: It could be understandable, from my understanding on American Justice System everything is money, you can be in the right but not have the funds to stand up for yourself
[0:51:17] oxoKumakichioxo: NODDERS defamation take many takes depending on angle it can be used
[0:51:17] KyriaTheMystic: What labor laws? KEKW
[0:51:17] alwiro: workers rights would prevent that yes
[0:51:19] pacegod: @VoxInSox23 are you ihs?
[0:51:20] bluedyedrose: Truth is an absolute defence, so this guy either is BSing or getting bad advice
[0:51:22] Phil246: A lawyer would have told them not to post publicly but will use in any trial
[0:51:23] nautilus_jiv: Germany protections are BIS
[0:51:23] KyriaTheMystic: US has no labor laws.
[0:51:24] Mezegis_Yo: isn't this whole post defamation since there isn't proof? IHaveAQuestion
[0:51:27] blessedIgnorant: But he is in the UK, no?
[0:51:27] EeraGames: But America has Freedom Kappa
[0:51:27] Fraky: but he is from the UK as well
[0:51:28] Dimortii: Blizzard would not survive 2 minutes in Germany
[0:51:29] Nbcal8: This is very normal in the US
[0:51:30] VoxInSox23: @preachlfw any lawyer would tell him to not publish any of this, but at least to hold the evidence in your pocket
[0:51:31] urbish_: hiii chat
[0:51:31] anaksana: isnt he also in the UK though, surely they cant stop him getting a UK based job
[0:51:32] ChrisHuge: Yeah, it's illegal in most of the EU, pretty strong employment rights here. US laws are more tricky employment law wise though.
[0:51:34] redroniksre: Yeah America the company can basically do whatever they want
[0:51:34] braskal: Worker Unions here would have a field day on this
[0:51:37] BlindOwlInTree: this is normal in US
[0:51:38] Nines713: Where is jeathe YEP
[0:51:39] Traion: Yeah putting this before a German union would end with the building on fire
[0:51:40] ChunkeyNinja: yep LUL
[0:51:49] OspreyRed: YEP
[0:51:49] blessedIgnorant: and yes German labour laws are WAY stricter
[0:51:50] LostEwok: I mean if he lives in UK and signed a US law employment contract the HR is right, he shouldn't have signed it lol
[0:51:53] Brandilath: He's a naive youth. It is natural he would be too afraid of retaliation.
[0:51:54] nakamuzzZ: In France some guy was paid 500k after being fired for not participating in work cohesion events lol
[0:51:56] knukles0: but only if there was an ongoing lawsuit
[0:51:57] kaspiDev: Like idk how many times I've now seen people go off on Twitter/YT/... and get noped out of it by lawyers before they get in too deep
[0:51:58] NevikLink: But what about Rockstar's UK tax evasion?
[0:52:01] EeraGames: Are the piss videos in it? modCheck
[0:52:03] Decadence001: @Preachlfw true, except if it's a public service. At that point, you just get fucked.
[0:52:03] turtleandfish: in the US. they dont even want unions
[0:52:04] ChrisHuge: Any lawyer would say not to tweet about it too, and to just take it to court.
[0:52:06] sstarfall_: he was told its a lost case I guess, so he dumped it all out on twitter
[0:52:07] alwiro: is it a puiblic trial tho?
[0:52:07] zuzua90: us has osha and that‚Äôs it hr is for the company and union is the mob
[0:52:11] HeffaBear: you guys watch too much tv if you think its normal in the US
[0:52:12] korath40: yea slam dunk in australia
[0:52:12] VoxInSox23: @pacegod I‚Äôm a lawyer in California
[0:52:13] alwiro: that is a very big difference
[0:52:15] KelticNight: doesn't want Phil Spencer turning up at his door
[0:52:27] viczz88: NETEASE KEKW
[0:52:30] ravenofjudgement: NetEase Concern
[0:52:30] aldric999999: pretty sure microsoft will bring the army of lawyers upon him
[0:52:31] anaksana: Didnt he say he was in the UK though, wouldnt UK employment rights apply to him
[0:52:32] knukles0: yeah if he had a lawsuit ongoing, tweeting about it would be an issue
[0:52:36] sebnificant: I'd be fucking terrified posting work emails online with all the NDA stuff you sign for these companies
[0:52:40] Krakatoa__: Netease
[0:52:47] Mezegis_Yo: 'I've Moved on' ... EXCEPT ALLLLLL THIS
[0:52:47] LasyPanda: @Preachlfw Hes not just messing with Blizzard now, Hes messing with Fucking Microsoft
[0:52:48] KaiZen2048: Shruge
[0:52:51] kickya_lipsoff: Shruge  Û†ÄÄ
[0:52:53] viczz88: attention Shruge
[0:52:53] gao_ftw: clout
[0:52:53] IceBurg85: dont wanna sue =/= not angry about it
[0:52:54] mellokr: to vent I guess
[0:52:54] rudezki: out of spite?
[0:52:55] maegnis: maegnis subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 22 months! emmallamaHeart
[0:52:55] pacegod: @VoxInSox23 great, but you are not his. so we have no idea what he's been advised
[0:52:56] Cubick23: To sell his mentorship like a true grifter
[0:52:56] pupkat: @Preachlfw get it off his chest
[0:52:57] gamersetapak: Told peps what bliz is
[0:52:57] Nbcal8: He's probably afraid of being sued into oblivion. Law suits are expensive, and time consuming,even if you win.
[0:52:59] majkos: He said he wanted to vent
[0:52:59] Ractorious: Young people don't think before doing shit LUL
[0:52:59] bunniechee: Misery loves company.
[0:52:59] juriell86: he tries to damage reputation
[0:52:59] Adaire3: @VoxInSox23 to be fair, if he was going to sue he'd be told not to talk about it at all :/
[0:53:00] IAmSolari: maybe it's just cathartic?
[0:53:03] DzikiWegorz1223: "why post all of this?" I wonder everyday
[0:53:03] EeraGames: @LasyPanda Maybe not for long KEKW
[0:53:03] Decadence001: Shruge isn't that what the youngsters do nowadays? @Preachlfw
[0:53:04] Diivine666: sow even more discord in the dumpster fire that is Blizz atm, that would be my guess
[0:53:04] Lithirrdys: Shruge frustration
[0:53:04] Plinglebob: Shit ster while blizzard in limelight for SoD
[0:53:05] NyHoK: For followers
[0:53:06] OnePlayerPete: To sell his 'mentorship' program
[0:53:09] Brandilath: Man had to get it off his chest. Just wanted to be heard.
[0:53:11] Lctl10: The positive in me : Awareness The Negative in me : Attention seeker
[0:53:12] Artful_Dodger: A warning to others not to work there.
[0:53:14] tribalmosh: Worked on the promise of a new role coming with his name on it. Role never came.
[0:53:18] MrCosines: Only obvious explanation is he wants to warn people to not go work for Blizzard thinking it's ok now that Bobby is gone (it's the whole comapny hierarchy that's the problem in his eyes)
[0:53:22] LasyPanda: @EeraGames Did i miss some news?
[0:53:22] nautilus_jiv: I can definitely sympathise with someone being scared and just tired of the whole thing but yeah I don‚Äôt get the whole airing your laundry on freaking twitter. This screams naivety
[0:53:22] Dimortii: Sadly it is heresay without evidence but the evidence is confidential information that he cannot publish. Any copy of an email or slack screenshot was taken against blizz policy and makes him liable
[0:53:23] pupkat: @Preachlfw get it off his chest Û†ÄÄ
[0:53:27] knukles0: The funny thing is, without proof he actually is more likelt to get sued for defamination, the emails are the only thing that protects him
[0:53:30] Daikanatv: promoting a side hustle by guilt tripping using a "shitty situation"
[0:53:31] countrycount: Yeah, i am gonna vent to my friends about this, not to a bunch of strangers
[0:53:31] eightfold999: bad attempt at reputation destruction
[0:53:32] KaiZen2048: True
[0:53:33] viczz88: Blizzard/Microsoft are calling up their own lawers over this as we speak LUL
[0:53:33] nakamuzzZ: It would be so unfair to expect people to keep this to themselves even tho they won‚Äôt attack a billion dollar company
[0:53:41] zuzua90: I doubt a company is going to sue someone who‚Äôs broke
[0:53:43] Shelana95: haha, indeed
[0:53:44] Sunshine_Eu: He states he doesnt want to be made liable however he has already named Blizzard
[0:53:45] Atreyu_Lavellan: There's too many shit stirrers in the World to take it on faith alone
[0:53:46] KelticNight: makes people aware so they don't get taken advantage of
[0:53:47] Shrandamar: indeed
[0:53:47] IceBurg85: the whole thread is him being na√Øve
[0:53:49] dajm_: dajm_ subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 10 months! Happy Friday!
[0:53:51] Rikamion: well, he has no experience, let him learnthe hard way :D
[0:53:51] zukohonor: blizz 100% trustworthy
[0:53:52] pacegod: if its slander, they will sue him
[0:53:53] VoxInSox23: @pacegod correct, but any decent lawyer would tell him to not write this or publish anything
[0:53:54] Streamlabs: üê≤ Check out our new Dragonflight merch in metal band live tour style! https://preachgaming.com/shop/ üê≤
[0:53:55] Marach: The whole thing is 3 months... I'm sure he said "most of the year"...
[0:53:57] MrZxorm: If i'm looking to vent, I talk to friends and family, not amke a long twiter post.
[0:53:59] EeraGames: @LasyPanda FTC looking to potentially reverse merger because Microsoft started sacking departments because it overlaps, but they're meant to be separate iirc
[0:54:05] viczz88: KEKW

[0:56:21] DukePiewalker: Really the season with a hot queen that goes crazy and starts burning capitals is brilliant according to him. Shocking!
[0:56:22] urbish_: Destroyed the cultural relevance of Game of Thrones in one swoop, so brilliant

[0:56:48] Mitartesio: Think Tali said they might use the layoffs now to make it seem like he was laid off or decided to leave in the wave of the firings. It seems like he hasn't done much, since Metzen came back
[0:56:50] Healzforcash: too many cooks probably
[0:56:52] Lctl10: "left"
[0:56:53] Farstrider__: "left"

[1:07:53] Chaoyang399: @Preachlfw Shadowlands was a case study in increasing market share to your biggest competitor
[1:07:54] Neverlast: Blizzard wasn't listening to it's playerbase on any level? @Preachlfw

[1:07:55] Archiduss: Not valueing player's time.
[1:07:55] Wooodsen: "we now better"
[1:07:55] sinclsw23: disconnect witht the player base
[1:07:56] urbish_: Ignoring the players

[1:08:02] LickingWay: or i fall behind
[1:08:04] Disfideus: @Preachlfw not enough polish/balancing, way too much grind
[1:08:04] Shelana95: Bad time gating, it was wrong way of punishing

[1:08:06] blowjo_: Conflict in story versus gameplay
[1:08:06] iBelg: Choices matter
[1:08:06] Hupu_a: Gating content behind choices long term
[1:08:06] joelster73: Meaningful choices
[1:08:07] TulkasStream: It was a business process problem, they were in hard waterfall and not agile enough to make changes

[1:08:10] NyxEUW: removing player choice

[1:08:14] Krakatoa__: Ignoring US
[1:08:14] anaksana: locked to covenants

[1:08:17] Larmenius: Micromanagement of players time
[1:08:18] MrZxorm: Story felt disjointed, the cov hating you/stopping access to areas after helping them seemed off
[1:08:20] Amyrantha_: limiting the amount of covenants you can join at the start of the xpac
[1:08:20] Geri_0123: don't tie player power to roleplay/cosmetic choices
[1:08:22] VoxInSox23: The ripcord

[1:08:36] Krakatoa__: they no better
[1:08:48] OspreyRed: NODDERS
[1:09:00] skuull23: while it was bad that wasnt by far the worst bit of shadowlands
[1:09:00] Krakatoa__: know
[1:09:09] zuzua90: I didn‚Äôt like not having an alt army
[1:09:22] Vinestra28: NODDERS aww you like X faction? guess what youre trash in terms of power
[1:09:30] Dipichipii: Should have the cov ability be a talent swap and call it a day
[1:09:34] MagmaScythe: How anybody let the Maw release in that state is beyond me.
[1:09:44] Kemskemss: BG3 proves that point so well
[1:09:46] ÁÑº„Åç„Åù„Å∞„Éë„É≥: also the fact they didn't change it till the last patch
[1:09:46] 1upped: it's all back to "you think you do, but you don't" they high horse and think they know better
[1:09:53] VoxInSox23: Blizzard thinking thr player base wouldn‚Äôt feel the need to min max
[1:09:55] Braggardt: necrolord dks having a great time EZ
[1:09:55] Tartuccio: DK night fae KEKW @Preachlfw
[1:09:56] d__rek: Plenty of games do that well though. Things should have an opptunity cost and games are better when making meaningful choises imo. Wow did it badly
[1:09:57] VallanceHeals: As I've always said, people can tolerate a mediocre story if the gameplay is stellar.
[1:09:59] Geri_0123: imagine wanting to play pvp frost mage and pve fire..
[1:10:02] Neroniss_: necrolord hunters unite
[1:10:08] KyriaTheMystic: Oh you want to choose X faction for RP? Too bad it's the worst pick for balance now you feel like crap in all content and you'll get kicked out of pugs.
[1:10:08] skuull23: the maw at release was way worse then covenant locking
[1:10:09] ployboi69: Night Fae LUL
[1:10:13] kellarXO: Shadowlands was my first experience with retail and when I hit 60 and learned I got locked with a covenant for a spell I quit LULW
[1:10:19] Synckery: do we worry hero talents are going to be similar in the sense that one will become meta and youll play that regardless of if you like the theme
[1:10:19] kinschen: or even in pve when one is good in m+ but bad in raid
[1:10:22] Stawnchy: That does tie to feedback though, bc people were calling that shit out from day one of beta. And they just plowed ahead
[1:10:24] EeraGames: Shruge but... line go up?
[1:10:34] turtleandfish: i thought that the problem with that is the lack of choices at endgame, everyone was pushed into the M+ or raiding route @Preachlfw
[1:10:37] StephixOne: Make 2 characters
[1:10:37] MasterBabble: 1 Aspect I believe is trying to to force an concept of progression that limits how players interact with the world and in turn limits the scope of what the players can do. Especially when players have limited time
[1:10:44] Adaire3: but meaningful choices! LUL
[1:10:53] VoxInSox23: Night fae warlocks for 2 years lmao
[1:10:59] Woddell: @VoxInSox23 It's not even min/max imo. I played balance druid and while I loved the Kyrian out of the rest but the playstyle with Convoke and DPS increase made it moronic if I didn't pick the fairies...
[1:11:00] blowjo_: It was even more bizarre that the story behind shadowlands made that gameplay restriction make even less sense
[1:11:01] ployboi69: An ERPG-er Kappa
[1:11:03] redroniksre: Or the best ability feeling like shit to use compared to weaker
[1:11:09] rymed: Honestly, I don't think people cared that much about covenants. I think the actual content of Shadowlands wasn't fun and felt really grindy and that was a bigger factor.
[1:11:22] Dagraine: duskwood?
[1:11:23] Vinestra28: ashenvale
[1:11:23] Zabraxa: Ashenvale
[1:11:23] SirAppleheart: I think a big reason why I didnt mind Shadowlands AS MUCH, was because the covenant I wanted to play was also BIS for my class
[1:11:23] mez_taz: ashenvale
[1:11:23] Chewmii: Shruge no one knows
[1:11:25] Farstrider__: wetlands

[1:11:35] MrZxorm: Worgenland
[1:11:38] countrycount: Ashenvale is huge
[1:11:39] Juzika031: ashen/duskwood/wetlands
[1:11:40] MrCosines: You can go to the Eastern Kingdoms and check out Duskwood
[1:11:43] Neverlast: Duskwood is poggers

[1:11:44] EeraGames: Despairge wood
[1:11:44] Boxer502: Duskwood poggers!
[1:11:44] manthelazy: same me I want to be ret pally as Kyrian covenant as rp and power butt nooo Vampire power are stronger....
[1:11:48] Geri_0123: the solution is to make a character that starts in durotar
[1:11:53] Molkohr: i've already done wetlands/duskwood/ashenvale at 25 Despairge what do I do?
[1:11:53] Jauffre_: Duskwood is one of my favourite zones <3
[1:11:53] rowern: isnt that the case with races aswell? @Preachlfw
[1:11:55] Impurite: Duskwood is BiS
[1:11:56] Zziggz: Lets get killed by stitches
[1:11:57] Vinestra28: Sure no warrior runes found
[1:12:01] skuull23: i picked just picked one wanted thematically and sure i was couple % off on dps but wasnt a big deal
[1:12:03] meercatsdot: stiches
[1:12:05] Phabey: Duskwood is way more fun than Ashenvale, Ashenvale is a snoozefest
[1:12:05] knukles0: @Preachlfw what did you think of Skull and Bones, I liked it but I had a new world feel to it, but I think need to see how the game goes with the full game I feel
[1:12:07] Methuzahla: I love Duskwood
[1:12:20] snuffles_80: Duskwood is my favorite Alliance zone
[1:12:22] MagmaScythe: NODDERS
[1:12:29] OspreyRed: shadowmeld in high end m+
[1:12:34] Garzag_: stone form YEP
[1:12:36] EeraGames: It DOES make line go up NODDERS
[1:12:37] sarkOpharg: Priest without a movement race is sooo bad
[1:12:38] understudy1: @Preachlfw I literally play human all the time simply because 10% rep buff. ITs just a time saver.
[1:12:39] majkos: Dwarf for days Sadge
[1:12:39] Kemskemss: @Preachlfw do you think fantasy as a design factor kinda lost on WoW? In a way that game is very oriented on efficient (not fun in RP way) end content
[1:12:41] ÁÑº„Åç„Åù„Å∞„Éë„É≥: i would spend more money race swapping if i could play whatever i like
[1:12:42] Lithirrdys: Number go up NODDERS
[1:12:46] Jauffre_: Duskwood is so good in terms of vibe and stories
[1:12:48] Teh_Gaffer: I mean, splitting the playerbase in two was a phenomenally stupid decision to begin with

[1:13:22] Skydanzer: I think its 17 or 19 smth like that
[1:13:31] Geri_0123: like method changing to an all troll raid for jaina
[1:13:43] rymed: ¬£19 is crazy expensive for a race change lol
[1:13:44] NevikLink: People also race change for ff14 raiding
[1:13:46] Bladetykon: @Preachlfw on one hand I agree with play what class you want to with waht race you want but also some of the choices are kinda baffeling like dranei warlock

[1:16:33] Skydanzer: what are they playing? they're playing the bench
[1:16:34] understudy1: Are shadowpriest playing a dwarf fire priest
[1:16:35] EeraGames: Nelf GIGACHAD
[1:16:35] majkos: @Synckery yeah, I said only 90% of issue will be gone :D
[1:16:37] ployboi69: Night elf kekw
[1:16:37] Mitartesio: Shadowmeld
[1:16:47] blessedIgnorant: If they wanted to make covenants a permanent choice they should not have tied power to it; by doing so they were immediately screwed. If you had the same abilities regardless of choice but different cosmetically would have made at least some sense.
[1:16:47] kurki666: bleed disspell is op
[1:16:48] OGpersi_: dwarf happens to be the highest DPS fire mage option by far too, it will be more skewed than usual
[1:16:56] sgtdampframme: so what does dwarf fire mages have that makes them meta=+
[1:16:56] EeraGames: Seed? Birdge
[1:17:00] OGpersi_: most specs will have more NE
[1:17:01] Teh_Gaffer: Shadowmeld: one of the worst racials in the game... and then came M+
[1:17:02] Allessii: shadowmeld
[1:17:03] majkos: NE priest enables extra skips

[1:17:10] meercatsdot: @Preachlfw Stars guild retiring from RTWF
[1:17:11] MrZxorm: The only good elf is a night elf
[1:17:13] Enoz___: Jesus is a nelf Shadow priest? huh
[1:17:14] VallanceHeals: @Preachlfw Ahhhh, Racials... Such meaningful choice.
[1:17:17] hiraikou: KEKW
[1:17:20] Skydanzer: Shadowmeld is too goated
[1:17:23] LasyPanda: @Preachlfw And pepole complain that FF14 dosent let you change your abilites
[1:17:25] EeraGames: ingame chatter donowalled Sadge
[1:17:30] Healzforcash: can meld abilities that would do a lot of team damage... its so crazy
[1:17:36] IAmSolari: meld is too good this season
[1:17:40] hiraikou: What about rogue?
[1:17:41] rowern: @skuull23 but then give races special abilities that are not combat related, so every1 can chose the races with the thematic that fits the best for them instead of feeling forced to play a certain races for a small bonus
[1:17:47] ultraangry: @MrZxorm I prefer the high elves CiGrip SmokeTime
[1:17:53] EeraGames: saved Pog
[1:18:04] Lithirrdys: Imagine a world where games were made to make fun, not money

[1:18:24] FCrambles: is this retail?
[1:18:27] Farstrider__: Tabard please
[1:18:29] ployboi69: The only good goblin is a dead goblin Kappa
[1:18:29] forevrzero: what do you think makes more money.... wow race changes or FF14 fantasia?
[1:18:37] soth_klf: is this the new PoE league?
[1:18:38] EeraGames: But do good games make all the money? Line must go up like a cliff edge MadgeLate
[1:18:39] Vinestra28: dinkDonk tabard?
[1:18:40] thebigmanblade: what do you mean? they clearly all chose the same race by coincidence Kappa
[1:18:42] Dragonnan_Drakelos: @fcrambles Season of Discovery
[1:18:42] Teh_Gaffer: Making money with your game is good, so long as it gets put back into the game
[1:18:43] IAmSolari: how did skull and bones go?
[1:18:45] Dreadzol: game developers are businesses after all Shruge
[1:18:51] Thelete: did we get bex hints for the new runes?
[1:18:53] Lithirrdys: profitable, no i agree, got to pay for things. But race changes, microtransactions, games built literally to drain your wallets? fuck that noise
[1:19:01] Vinestra28: @Thelete they havent all been found yet
[1:19:02] concealment360: concealment360 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 73 months! Glad to see the office looking great in the background, keep up the good work!
[1:19:03] majkos: remove racials and make race change 5$, people would change all the time for fun
[1:19:07] knukles0: Well if the top teams have 25 players and 4 toons each, that is 100, so say 5 teams do it at ¬£20 each that is ¬£10,000, not much in the overall for Blizz but at least adds up
[1:19:12] JohnWallace: how many minutes for a hardboiled egg?
[1:19:15] Thelete: @Vinestra28 but some surely has? :P
[1:19:17] Juzika031: dwarves master race
[1:19:18] Mitartesio: Saw AndyBrew playing Paladin GigaChad

[1:19:22] LasyPanda: @Preachlfw Do you think that in 2 years will get SoD Vanila?
[1:19:27] DzikiWegorz1223: I liked the aquarium style more
[1:19:32] P4rappa: People waking up to the dwarf supremacy GIGACHAD
[1:19:33] Arcolite: Dwarf is pretty much BIS for most classes atm. The extra crit dmg + stoneform is lovely
[1:19:35] Shelana95: Damn Ayjie is popping off, I know him well
[1:19:36] Vinestra28: @Vinestra28 only like 5?
[1:19:39] MagicPants_99: stoneform is just too good
[1:19:41] countrycount: nah those races have been pretty constant for a couple season now
[1:19:41] Mitartesio: AndySama AYAYAYA
[1:19:54] xsp00n: NO WARRIOR RUNES FOUND YET

[1:20:03] Methuzahla: NODDERS
[1:20:05] Phabey: Pog
[1:20:11] Sprinklerz: the meta since cross faction has always been dwarf in m+ @Preachlfw
[1:20:13] Hupu_a: waiting for bex list NODDERS
[1:20:16] Mitartesio: @Methuzahla GIGACHAD
[1:20:19] skuull23: @rowern i can agree with that to some extent like i play undead and undending breath is cool (kinda pointless now how long base breath is) but i love will of the forsaken, usually not come in play but when there a sleep or whatever ability in dungeon its great to feel like this my thing.
[1:20:21] Daemavand: That's awesome, ty Bex <3
[1:20:27] its_bono_mate: @Methuzahla  GIGACHAD
[1:20:27] GeordieMarauder: that‚Äôs awesome, thanks @methuzahla
[1:20:29] sinclsw23: can we all agree Bex is a champ?
[1:20:36] Dragonnan_Drakelos: @preachlfw Do you think most people will be overhyped, not get what they made up in their mind and bitch and moan about all of 10.2.6?
[1:20:40] OspreyRed: @Sprinklerz and Nelf's. Shadowmeld allows for skips
[1:20:45] Methuzahla: Waiting on a lot to be found atm but we'll be putting them on our website for people to follow
[1:20:45] epicspacebears: @Preachlfw Tabard when?
[1:20:45] icelight96: icelight96 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 4 months! 
[1:20:48] LasyPanda: Good job Bex, finiding all the Runes by yourself to post Clues for mike
[1:21:08] Dimortii: Dimortii subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 28 months, currently on a 28 month streak! Tabard When? Smadge
[1:21:27] ChunkeyNinja: well a weakaura
[1:21:31] Dernsby: It's just not possible
[1:21:35] Healzforcash: nothing ever can
[1:21:41] KyriaTheMystic: Unless they outright add housing, nah.
[1:21:45] KyriaTheMystic: No way.
[1:21:59] Dragonnan_Drakelos: @kyriathemystic That probably will never happen
[1:22:01] countrycount: 10.2.6 is literally 5 new raids, actually close to a new expansion frfr
[1:22:05] urbish_: If people expect anything close to that they are delusional
[1:22:09] rymed: It's just a small incremental patch, right? It's not going to be massive?
[1:22:10] LasyPanda: They will add Housing 100%
[1:22:11] zuzua90: path of the titans when?
[1:22:12] VallanceHeals: Go in with low expectations.
[1:22:13] ravenoushydra: nah you were right I think 10.2.6 is gonna be shadowlands revamped
[1:22:20] majkos: After making 90 runes Bex will be so tired and will just go "Clue: Bibbity bobbity go to 10.2 34.5 in Wasteland"
[1:22:26] NeeK_23: Gnomergan already cleared in 12 hours.... talk about sweaty gamers
[1:22:28] elderratt: hopefully something just for fun
[1:22:31] Synckery: @Preachlfw are you worried hero talents will have a similar effect as covenants? albeit you can freely change, one build will be "meta" and people may complain that they'll have to play the one they dont like the theme of
[1:22:38] elderratt: like the saucer
[1:22:40] Vitriol17: I expected nothing, and I'm still disappointed
[1:22:44] LasyPanda: Its Houing
[1:22:44] Hick12: WoW for Augmented Reality headsets.
[1:22:46] rymed: OK, so no new systems but a little fun event
[1:22:47] rowern: @skuull23 that is true and maybe there is a middle ground where the ability is available in open world and dungeons besides m+, so can even make more impactful abilities without it breaking competitive content
[1:22:52] EeraGames: ALOO neighbours
[1:22:59] Lupusdeus: Was this based on the tease of the skull and bones on the roadmap, was that 10.2.6? Havent played retail in ages @Chat
[1:23:00] Umseslad: monkaS They're coming for him
[1:23:01] Farstrider__: flap flap flap

[1:23:11] Vitriol17: hiii
[1:23:14] LuiBMHunter: peers - Mike not max level yet?  slacker!
[1:23:14] rymed: @LasyPanda That would be an expansion seller
[1:23:17] Dragonnan_Drakelos: @synckery As sure to happen as disappointment of 10.2.6.
[1:23:31] zuzua90: blizzard is coming for him he said too much about war with in
[1:23:51] Vitriol17: its the rat come to take him away
[1:23:56] OniScythe: Concern
[1:23:58] LasyPanda: @rymed I be shocked if tis not it, For 3 years now WoW players begging for it after FF14
[1:24:01] EeraGames: "This is the blizzard legal team, you mentioned seeing a whiteboard, you are now coming with us to the War Within Bunker until the saga is over"
[1:24:05] Edrem: Sludge wenz bin stream
[1:24:44] Lupusdeus: @LasyPanda There's no way housing isn't an expansion feature
[1:25:04] elderratt: @LasyPanda wrong we were begging for way longer than that
[1:25:05] LuiBMHunter: anyone there to drag stitches to say ello to Mike? :)
[1:25:10] Umseslad: WorryStab
[1:25:14] LasyPanda: @Lupusdeus But it is Expension, there is a new one this year
[1:25:16] daris888: housing is an expansion feature for sure
[1:25:24] oxoKumakichioxo: BoneZone
[1:25:25] Geri_0123: @elderratt and we got garrisons..
[1:25:27] Dragonnan_Drakelos: @lasypanda Didn't they mention multiple times they can't do it, at least not as the players would like it, because system limitatioms or something?
[1:25:27] betweenlions: Stiches anyone PauseChamp
[1:25:33] Lithirrdys: housing COPIUM
[1:25:41] Lupusdeus: @LasyPanda Right but 10.2.6 is a patch, not an expansion
[1:25:44] Zziggz: Go get stitches
[1:25:46] KaiZen2048: @betweenlions Now is the moment PauseCat
[1:25:48] rowern: @LasyPanda i doubt it since they are changing so many old existing systems to make alot of stuff account wide
[1:25:50] MonarchTeaV: it‚Äôs going to be vampire survivors built into wow, using the power system from torghast. available to queue for in your main town (org or stormwind)  :)
[1:25:50] meercatsdot: @preach do you think it will be an event on both classic and retail servers?

[1:27:37] skuull23: @rowern imo the trouble is trying to super balance it for top 1% (or whatever) players as they always do degen stuff even if really minor advantage, let them do that and let people have fun with abilities, but yeah i can say remove dps ones and give situational stuff

[2:07:53] spudmorph: I remember it was announced at the same time as sea of thieves
[2:07:53] DukePiewalker: If D4 fixes their itemization in S4 and actually succeeds in getting some aspirational stuff its gonna be a good game to throw away a week or two with for some seasons.

[2:54:00] Geri_0123: are you familiar with Jim Browning's style for scam callers? It was nice watching those when he got into their CCTV and stuff
[2:54:02] EeraGames: Yeah they've been doing AI voices of family members that need you to send them money ASAP for whatever reason
[2:54:03] Havesh: I once got a scam call where someone claimed to be from a fancy restaurant saying I ditched the (very expensive) bill, after having ordered several flutes of champagne.
[2:54:35] darkingbog_: When I moved to the UK I kept getting scam calls claiming to be HMRC planning to send police after me
[2:54:43] kaspiDev: We had a "world's worst jobs" but "at home" (aka local version in our country). The reporter went to a scam call center and she managed to stay there for a whole week before having a guilt meltdown and just stopping the report.

[2:56:30] Lunarsear: is that car shit still going on?
[2:56:33] Decadence001: Oh, elaborate stories about how i got this injury are utterly ridiculous. If it weren't illegal, I'd have recorded some of them for the lols @Preachlfw
[2:56:34] vozmozi: I got a call from gamestop letting me know there was an old wow collectors edition hidden under an old display unit. it was $0.00 and sealed they called it warhammer lmao

[2:56:56] Vinestra28: bad? theyre amazing SmadgeW innovative
[2:56:56] imnepse: Feels good charging a mob, missing your first attack and the rend, just for another player tagging it with an instant spell <3
[2:57:00] Ronny_Styles: And then there's tbc where you have to kill 40 mobs for a single quest
[2:57:04] Umseslad: IHaveAQuestion If Mr Brackers can get nuggies can I get a milkshake?
[2:57:06] leegolas_WSS: oh that reminds me @preach, was it bought on finance before 2021, i cant remember. Just that there could be some big payouts due to discressionary comission
[2:57:15] AngryFil: man, i remember a scam call i once had: "your [bank name] card has been blocked" - "i don't have a card in that bank" - "... erm... what bank DO you have a card in?" OMEGALUL
[2:57:20] kaspiDev: We did something cool in a fintech application. You could detect if a client using your app in browser has ports open that screensharing apps use. So it's like a white hat hacking. "Hacking" your clients to prevent fraudsters from scamming them...

[5:08:31] ravenoushydra: for the last boss or kelris?
[5:08:34] nohomu67: Shruge Just FAP

[5:08:48] aftergl0w: It stops chains
[5:08:48] Myleod: use fap phase 2 and the chain cast doesnt jump
[5:08:49] steelfurspeaks: If you FAP in p2, he doesn't cast chains
[5:08:54] steelfurspeaks: because he can't target anyone
[5:08:55] DrazDubz: FAP stops chains being applied
[5:08:57] tirain67: you become immune to the chain debuff for 30 secs
[5:08:57] Vinestra28: THe chains dot is the killer
[5:09:00] ravenoushydra: the chains that you can't interrupt anymore count as a movement impairing effect so faps counter it
[5:09:02] Presea_Diamond: @Preachlfw The cast roots you so with FAP potions you are immune
[5:09:13] Dulgarn: FAP makes you immune the the chains debuff

[6:54:13] Mitartesio: @GilgameshRebirth7 Kinda, but not really. You didn\t need to kill mythic or a specific fight to get the weapon. I mean more like cool looking weapons like the ff14 ones
[6:54:18] brastilou: that requires to have a good story in the first place

[7:28:24] Azikielboi: @brastilou thats kinda all of them
[7:28:30] broomguy7: 2 seconds SourPls 5% increase
[7:28:31] Azikielboi: to be clear these are not intended to add a lot to HOW u play
[7:28:35] Thelete: YEP
[7:28:39] Azikielboi: they are just supposed to be flavor
[7:28:39] ursinealli: but no increase of no tree active
[7:28:40] SpiderXIV: Shruge tree
[7:28:43] Maddroxv: yeh Monk isnt out yet so the worse is yet to come xd
[7:28:47] dragothicx: YEP proc
[7:28:48] steelfurspeaks: @Azikielboi unless you're a priest or a mage :D
[7:28:49] Javandus: i wonder if they want some hero classes to be minimal gameplay changes for people who want similar gameplay as dragonflight?
[7:28:53] brastilou: @Azikielboi all this does, creating a balancing nightmare.. even more
[7:28:56] PlexasAideron: hey @Preachlfw  just in time for more lip on tentacle action https://twitter.com/baldursgate3/status/1755980870664466761 FeelsHentaiMan
[7:29:00] garyhun: This is like studying for school
[7:29:06] Azikielboi: @steelfurspeaks priest is too far, mage doesnt really change the rotation
[7:29:26] YuushaEX: 2 minutes
[7:29:46] steelfurspeaks: @Azikielboi Yeah I get the point, but its boring. The grove thing could at least give you like a big summon CD, or change the shape of them or something
[7:29:47] Winter7735: peepoClap YAYYY
[7:29:51] P4rappa: amazin... ResidentSleeper
[7:30:00] KelticNight: percentages POGGERS
[7:30:07] Azikielboi: @steelfurspeaks yeah i think they should be cooler visually for sure, but if u have played DF the game is complex enough
[7:30:09] Miyu_Fhey: they need to remove all thse % stuff if you get them anyway and just bake them into the skills as you level up
[7:30:18] Azikielboi: it doent need more "interesting talents" rn @steelfurspeaks
[7:30:18] DaftiDuck_: at least thatll look cool
[7:30:26] P4rappa: A whole 10 percent Pog
[7:30:44] Javandus: BM is a passive spec lol
[7:30:46] steelfurspeaks: @Azikielboi Changing how spells work slightly doesn't increase rotation complexity
[7:31:03] Mezegis_Yo: KEKW
[7:31:03] glenngf: somehow more boring than druid Bedge
[7:31:03] brastilou: KEKW
[7:31:04] Miyu_Fhey: This is vanilla "spend 5 points for 3% more damage" level of snooze
[7:31:04] P4rappa: KEKW

[7:31:33] Jauffre_: @GuardianEU roll for it
[7:31:35] Azikielboi: @steelfurspeaks i mean maybe its defeinitely a small design area, change in how they play but not adding complexity, but ur right there is some room there
[7:31:51] Tubbybaggins: Justice4NUPPS
[7:31:53] Mezegis_Yo: Hunter/Druids, 5 min job. Easy work for Nupps

[7:32:48] KelticNight: all downhill from there Classic
[7:32:50] Xo1o: Funny, I thought Mage tree was bad
[7:32:51] Azikielboi: which is perfect
