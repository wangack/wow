[1:16:03] smashwow: @smashwow the stormkeeper every 40s is going to be very clunky. I say this because if that 40s gets desynced in a fight - rip. in ST everyone is running mastery so you're just blasting out lava bursts. lightning bolt really is just a forgotten spell. if i had to cast lightning bolt, i'm having a really bad time on ST. in AOE the 2p gains more value but again if you desync the 40s vs your pulls you're having a bad time.
[1:16:53] Nokterian: D4 hype almost there! towLets towGo
[1:17:49] smashwow: i equate the the ele 2p to wings procs on a pally. if you're not getting the proc when it's useful it's a bad time.

[2:30:29] Blas0n: whats the one right of ardent defender
[2:30:32] ikik67: hi! im new
[2:30:34] Molvonos: With all those spells coming at you from the DF dungeons, might be good to drop a point from one of the 1/2 point talents if you cant
[2:30:38] abracka_: could prob give up bastion of light
[2:30:41] Blas0n: ye
[2:30:49] Blas0n: faiths barricade
[2:30:51] Blas0n: for more block
[2:30:57] Blas0n: ooooo

[2:31:02] Blas0n: lmao
[2:31:07] Blas0n: LUL LUL
[2:31:10] abracka_: bastion seems better for raid compared to m+
[2:31:14] Blas0n: Prot pally is so good now
[2:31:18] ikik67: what u guys talking about
[2:31:18] Blas0n: so many good choices
[2:31:26] LuiBMHunter: take a point out of one of the 2 pointers?
[2:31:34] Blas0n: Its a good problem to have
[2:31:52] NickLeonhearth: dont feel like there's a wrong choice, just situational
[2:31:59] ikik67: if i am not gonna lie basatian is good for raid
[2:32:06] ikik67: bastion*
[2:32:21] LuiBMHunter: pff a real tank would have no talents!

[2:32:55] Sollice: @LuiBMHunter Listen...no one will listen to you. Your a hunter
[2:32:57] Molvonos: You've got BM hunter in your name, opinion denied.

[2:34:13] Scarhearth: @Big_Wanshan If chuck norris was a tank the mobs would tank him
[2:34:40] Blas0n: its soo good
[2:34:44] Sollice: @LuiBMHunter I play a hunter not jealous. I think hunters as a whole are complainers ( not saying you ). The only hunters I guess who could complain are survival but then I think them complaining is stupid...Just play something else
[2:34:47] KingSpud91: Sentinel is SO good
[2:35:02] WaverlyP15: bm hunter not allowed to have an opinion on anything but bm hunter.
[2:35:03] LuiBMHunter: fair enough :)

[2:47:13] Sollice: I don't like Wraithion
[2:47:14] abracka_: ebonhorn/ebyssian for leader pls
[2:47:15] BoogiePonderosa: ending like Game of Thrones?
[2:47:16] vulkankragon: @Shrenko LUL
[2:47:26] GingerGambit: Wraithion or Sab is going to die, only way
[2:47:28] sheepinthebigcity: wrathion's entire character is centered around being pretty selfish without that he's nothing so i agree
[2:47:43] noLaG_: deathwing was wrathions dad right?
[2:47:54] Sollice: Well he constantly helps us and Azeroth, but the problem with Wraithion is it seems to always be a look at me look at me I helped kind of thing
[2:47:59] kalithian2: yep, wrathions a prince
[2:48:00] Sollice: Correct @noLaG_
[2:48:25] Sollice: Was Ebonhonr a son of Neltharion? I dont remember, I know Sabel was
[2:48:52] WaverlyP15: @Sollice True but wrathion is also kinda ruthless in the fact that he'll do anything to get the job done

[2:49:10] abracka_: hope 4p gets changed to have targets deal less damage to you when heartfire is applied to them, or something else. current one is so white bread
[2:49:11] kalithian2: not sure, i know neltharion is deathwing, that was his name before he became deathwing
[2:49:49] Sollice: @Sollice Yeah which we need someone to be. That's fine. Again it always feels like he's doing it for the attention not to truely be a savior

[2:50:46] blakemac412: based
[2:50:57] WaverlyP15: @Sollice oh yeah sabellion is definitely in it just for attention, but he levels out all the slow methodical types
[2:50:57] c0mmander_starscream: Hell Amouranth is prolly going to stream D4
[2:51:03] Blas0n: @noLaG_ LUL
[2:51:05] largefromage: my mom can barely operate a cell phone
[2:51:09] WaverlyP15: @Sollice meant wrathion, not sab
[2:51:09] GingerGambit: Nope. Tried them and didn’t like the style of game
[2:51:11] Inthezonewow: Kapp
[2:51:12] Sollice: If it's truely for the black flight, Sab should be the leader. He is the only one who has actually been with the flight. Ebonhorn and Wraithon really have been around the black flight. There werent as many in non DF lands. Sabellion was at least leading some in Outland
[2:51:14] therealrayred: naaa

[2:51:58] Putcride: @Towelliee but tommorow is also st.patty day so what are the odds some are going to party instead of playing d4?
[2:51:59] Lasidor: where da tier on this ptr thing lol
[2:52:02] largefromage: LUL
[2:52:10] DunzoCD: you see the sacrial and shroud game?
[2:52:14] kalithian2: @Towelliee so do you think blizz will make a diablo MMO after they're done with 4?
[2:52:15] WaverlyP15: @Sollice oh yeah for sure, wrathion just needs to stay prince and lead armies or something
[2:52:24] Sollice: Surprised he last that long
[2:52:41] Sollice: I would have figured he would have left sooner with Amazon purchase
[2:52:57] nHAV0Kz: HeyGuys

[2:56:39] Sollice: Splash Damage worked on Halo: Master Chief Collection, Gears of War 4 and 5, and Brink, among many projects.
[2:56:46] wEiRdO_dUdE: A Shroud game should have good PvP
[2:56:53] Sollice: Brink was pretty fun. Didn't get a lot of play but was great

[2:57:00] temp3st98: brink
[2:57:07] Blas0n: brink was pretty cool idea
[2:57:12] Blas0n: i think ahead of its time
[2:57:19] Sollice: I hope it's not a Dayz thing though. Dayz can be so slow.
[2:57:21] biirrd: btw, now when the target dummies goes down to 0 life, does that not make the details meter show wrong info, becouse you dont make any dmg in the combat-log?

[3:24:38] paulson14: why do people sell m+ runs for gold for next raid tier or just because they love gold.
[3:24:53] MysticalOS: it increases bandwidth of combat log since it's sending more than double the info, but it only lags you if you're on like a 4Mbit DSL connection
[3:24:53] joe_g_433: I can’t believe raid testing has already started.
[3:25:31] Lasidor: Wheres the tier vendor?  I cant find or Im dumb? Both are possible.

[3:29:31] EmpathyLiveChat: :)
[3:29:32] MysticalOS: biggest help with ass soreness is proper seat depth, and chair height. your feet should be flat on floor at a 90 degree angle with as much of your leg as possible balancing weight. if your butt is carrying all weight cause feet aren't flat on ground holding some of it, you'll get sore
[3:29:40] Zettabyte: Double down will become double up Kappa

[4:37:17] HaloS23: @Towelliee yet another reason to get rid of DLS
[4:37:56] MysticalOS: Oondasta

[4:38:04] Dagomarus: Imagine if towellie didn’t read them, chat wouldn’t know to split them and would be there for hours
[4:38:10] 91Niki: Oondasta. People spinning him around on the raid KEKW
[4:38:18] MysticalOS: we TOLD ian on PTR it would be a disaster with spiritfire beam, he was like "nah isle of giants is too remote, it own't ever be crowded"

[4:40:47] LearnedSomething: that's a great picture
[4:40:55] 91Niki: Recruite playing wow in lightmode DansGame
[4:40:56] MysticalOS: it might be gettings tuck on blizzard cinematic for first launch, edit config to say "already seen that shit" might get around it
[4:40:59] cmitchell042092: I vote that we all agree on what DLS we want and just stay there. No more of this switching twice a year and confusing the fuck out of everything.
