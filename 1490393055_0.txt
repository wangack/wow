[0:44:58] Davenbeast: there is no to much haste for ret
[0:45:01] shdahtrr: sometimes you might want to cancel auto attack swing to get the twist off
[0:45:02] LazzeyX: !commands
[0:45:03] erostg: Sadge I hate classical
[0:45:03] StreamElements: @LazzeyX, You can find a list of all Commands here https://streamelements.com/shroud/commands

[0:45:07] Paradoxsie: What a fucking mess
[0:45:07] SurveillantYIKES: when haste pot is up you have to twist twice consecutively then CS on the third auto. it's called 2/3 rotation
[0:45:08] aftrmdnt: its practice having to twist faster
[0:45:10] Pacatttack: Hardest rotation in game @shroud
[0:45:14] Jschip: @purpose816 triggered
[0:45:17] habib033: pepeD pepeD pepeD
[0:45:21] purpose816: @studmuffin1166 i hear great things about it but I can’t get it to make sense lol
[0:45:23] SurveillantYIKES: yeah one of the harder rotations for sure

[0:45:29] Antilles7: !sens
[0:45:29] StreamElements: @Antilles7, Looking for his sensitivity for a specific game? Type the game name and sens - like !valorantsens or !apexsens
[0:45:44] ryufromstreets6: @shroud so you can auto with blood, which does more dmg than command auto
[0:45:48] terrorym: Love how affloc isnt even on the dps meter
[0:45:52] Draiv_: Did he switch to paladin I only remember seeing a shaman?
[0:46:00] Davenbeast: blood does more dmg then command on avg combine it with cs because you cant cs in a twist
[0:46:00] Roninmon: should I get wow? is it worth it now?
[0:46:05] oldskoolraver_: crazy game
[0:46:08] SurveillantYIKES: you wanna cs when you are in blood because the auto that follows needs to be blood auto not command.  because blood is more damage

[0:46:42] Pacatttack: Name a harder spec in tbc were u have to time all your hits or you do no damage @Roo_93
[0:46:42] zajppp: do u maldraxus?
[0:46:42] Quirup: you only judge with blood to receive damage and keep more mana since command should be using rank 1 only
[0:46:51] patrynize: @Pacatttack hunter
[0:46:55] SurveillantYIKES: so the entire rotation is like CS - filler window - auto - judge window - command - twist blood auto - CS - filler window - repeats from there
[0:47:01] Napsterlul: on the rotation you are CS ing you dont switch to command untill next auto
[0:47:16] ryufromstreets6: @Roo_93 do tell what the hardest rotation is
[0:47:18] oidaxx: let auto go off if u cant make the swap
[0:47:18] Pacatttack: @patrynize Lol your joking right u can just spam steadyshot and do insane damage
[0:47:20] SurveillantYIKES: and then on haste pot or lust you twist twice in a row instead of once (unless you go below 1.9 then the rotation changes to something else called 2/4)
[0:47:22] cheddaberetta: if u cant twist then u want to stay on blood
[0:47:26] SurveillantYIKES: you let the auto go off in blood
[0:47:30] patrynize: @Pacatttack you clearly don't play ret or hunter
[0:47:47] SurveillantYIKES: every auto you do needs to have blood. it's either a blood auto following CS or a blood auto with command twist
[0:47:53] patrynize: @Pacatttack your entire rotation changes with haste as hunters
[0:47:59] shadorien: dps always arguing if their 2 button rotation is hardest LUL
[0:48:03] NonExposer: Idek wtf going on
[0:48:04] Hawkerton: tbc rotas hard? LUL
[0:48:08] Pacatttack: If your melee weaving sure maybe be the same dificulty as a ret then
[0:48:09] ryufromstreets6: @Roo_93 ret also changes their rotation based on attack speed on top of needing to fit in CS/fillers in tight timings
[0:48:10] SurveillantYIKES: it's very complicated rotation changes a lot when you get below speeds like 2.0
[0:48:10] AverageJonas: I mean the problem with ret is that the rotation changes based on the GCD speed right? so you kinda gotta keep track on your gcd speed to know which rotation is ideal? or am I mistaken (also didnt play alot of ret)? cause afaik gcd has a haste cap but not autoattacks
[0:48:14] Ac1d1993: @shadorien xD
[0:48:17] veequal: you got the 2h from sunwell trash?
[0:48:21] Baltickat: @surveillantyikes what nameplate addon is he using bro ?
[0:48:22] SurveillantYIKES: you don't have to keep track of gcd speed really
[0:48:29] notColt45: PauseChamp
[0:48:39] Pacatttack: @AverageJonas Yup haste pot also fucks with ur timing as ret
[0:48:39] shadorien: weeee
[0:48:44] SurveillantYIKES: I'm not sure what that addon is threatplates maybes
[0:49:02] SurveillantYIKES: haste pot doesn't fuck with your timing you just have to adjust the rotation. haste pot is great
[0:49:02] TesservcT: lay

[0:49:52] AverageJonas: its cool when the rotation has many outcomes like this tbh, forces you to think

[0:50:51] Patrush1: @karamurat38 neither
[0:50:53] Napsterlul: Think of it this way. you only want to cast the seal of command only in the auto when you are twisting. every other situation you want to be in blood/ judge blood etc @shroud
[0:50:54] sleep_val6: @karamurat38 I recommend tbc classic

[0:56:17] Husobossss: how many days for max lvl?
[0:56:22] Figsy69: you're doing great buddy
[0:56:24] SurveillantYIKES: @shroud you can't twist the same auto that you use crusader strike. let the blood ride until the auto then twist after. you're trying to twist and CS the same auto which is not possible
[0:56:30] ZeroXides: @jd4life_ No lol why would you do that. So you dont know anything going in?
[0:56:35] Atc636: Mmo mike

[0:57:04] Cybernytez: @jd4life_  up to you but it would make sense to start when an xpac starts but not a must, if you play now you could learn already how the game works
[0:57:06] Nerfmeh1: @Lupusdeus atleast it's higher dps than warrior the first 2 tiers, where warrior is at the bottom of the barrel Sadge
[0:57:06] SoonishSoon: is WoW still subscription based game?
[0:57:17] atec1983: yes
[0:57:20] Atc636: @soonishsoon yes

[0:57:24] ZeroXides: @jd4life_ If you truly want to play wow start now learn the game instead of going in asking 10k questions nobody wants to answer
[0:57:24] jd4life_: @Cybernytez yea, thats what i was thinking
[0:57:25] SurveillantYIKES: after you cs you just consecrate or exorcism and let the blood auto go off. instead you are trying to fit a twist which is not possible , and then you end up scuffing the next auto as well @shroud
[0:57:27] SoonishSoon: @Atc636 Sadge
[0:57:28] Joshy_________: Judge crusader!!
[0:57:48] MceeOG: so how do you actually seal twist

[0:57:54] Yungfree: whats the point of the red line on the swing timer
[0:58:02] Lupusdeus: @veiloflonelystars yeah 100% mate, but it isn't insane early in wrath, it's still infinitely better than in tbc :)
[0:58:02] rrhawtin: ye, retri is great in wotlk, prot pala is the best tank though by far. Though choice. Holy is also great

[0:59:28] Shiftyloid: you dont need to twist
[0:59:28] MceeOG: easy rotation in WOTLK?
[0:59:29] wheeltrain: 1 button macro gods in wrath
[0:59:32] aftrmdnt: no seal twists make it shit

[1:12:23] swifcik_: @jcjoeyfreak thanks a lot
[1:12:24] SurveillantYIKES: the kiljaeden rotation is different because your attack speed is so fast. you're doing 2/3 (twist twist CS) most of the time then 2/4 or 2/5 during lust (very complicated) it's gonna take a lot of practice

[2:19:52] matching_towels: I think if u played classic ages ago u like it, new ppl should go to retail
