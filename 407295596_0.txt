[0:06:09] UHMW: The point of these is to do them as efficiently and quickly as possible... you wont see variety unless you allow unlimited character swapping to perhaps have different healers or different comps specific for dungeons. This isnt about the classes, its about the players and their abiliy to come up with strats

[0:08:31] nuckAU: so i can watch
[0:08:50] Fierced: @drylie84 why do you think Gingi doesnt play it for MDI? They're good, like most other classes. But this is a race. Double rogue is just to good to pass up.
[0:08:59] I_DoctorSatan_I: @flavius1212 Rich and his gang are for AWC only
[0:09:01] Thedragonsenpai: @oxBrutalxo member last mdi dk was meta now its warrior Clap Clap Clap
[0:09:05] xstraightbrutal: @ditino_medio so prot war, resto druid, 2 combat rogues, and a DH?
[0:09:17] galinhoo: @oxBrutalxo to be honest part is cause it is a race and also there is a rule that prevents swaps (1 per dungeon)
[0:09:19] bVue12: inb4 rogue gets the nerf
[0:09:21] Telomir: LUL CLAP 'N SAP INC LUL
[0:09:29] Fierced: Everyone moaning about it being meta for MDI, where-as its always been like this for MDI races. Meta comps and mirror comps
[0:09:34] xstraightbrutal: @Thedragonsenpai but now warriors might get nerfed because of DPS haha RIP
[0:09:41] UHMW: its not about the meta, its about the ability to run fast... which leads to certain classes always going to be ahead. No way around it... a lot of these guys dont main rogues or the class they are playing on live and do just fine.... but will play what will work best for ultimate speed.

[0:10:21] Doipa_: just look at every other game at the top end.. its literally always the same or similar things.
[0:10:23] Fierced: About the run speed? LuL You must not really play the game if you think thats the reason they do double rogue
[0:10:25] Red_Queen____: yes @DeaTV, ITS VERY MUCH LIVE
[0:10:27] Johnnyzed: Thunderbluff, feelsgood
[0:10:27] galinhoo: Blizzard prevent teams from changing their comp properly, so you cant really have niche picks and this makes everyone run the default
[0:10:31] Red_Queen____: Omg, caps, sorry
[0:10:36] xstraightbrutal: @galinhoo yeah ik its a race. but makes you wonder what other comp possibilities could you make that could possibly go faster
[0:10:40] Rhewiz: @UHMW so you're talking about mobility? and speed from different classes? how come warlocks and other low speed classes was good in legion?

[0:11:19] Eldares: !setups
[0:11:21] Doipa_: @Rhewiz obviouly.. high damage = trash dies quicker = youre running faster through the dungeon. whats so hard to udnerstand

[0:11:30] HiddenDonutSpy: shakibCOMFY goodnight chat stay comfy
[0:11:50] Telomir: in any competitive environment (esp time based), a converging meta will always arise with 1 to n teams, based on content design. Based on the nature of BfA dungeons, its not surprising that the existing meta exists (these 2 teams - the WW or DK variant) - its just how it is. Might see more with engineering rez, but due to restrictions, Rdruid is optimal, TC prot warrior is essentially a quasi 4th dps and tank built into one.. and the utility of rogues (esp shroud) is unbeatable.
[0:11:53] xstraightbrutal: @Fierced so pretty much if you wanna do high keys you gotta reroll if youre not a rogue, dh, druid, or warrior
[0:12:01] Red_Queen____: gn @wolf_ayaya jakbHI
[0:12:05] Fierced: No...
[0:12:05] Telomir: Utility + dungeon design + outcome (speed) is why the current meta exists.
[0:12:06] RadioGodX: goodnigt @wolf_ayaya shakibCOMFY
[0:12:09] Fierced: did you read at all?
[0:12:14] ibaralabar: bonsoir ;)

[0:12:27] calcinacci: +18 speedruns =/= High keys
[0:12:43] Drakedog_KR: is that just 18+ run?
[0:12:50] xstraightbrutal: we need to do +25s lets go
[0:12:51] UHMW: if you allowed unlimited swapping you could see monk healers and more dk play imo, but because you are only allowed one swap per match you will see a more all around team that works for each dungeon with very few swaps
[0:12:53] Kahlandra: evening ladies and gents
[0:12:54] Sleepypan: hii @PRYNNiboy_ shakibCOMFY
[0:12:55] Brackker: made it PogChamp ready to see 3 rogues in each team
[0:12:57] UHMW: mainly dk for specific dungeon
[0:13:01] JigsawSaint: this cooldown timer is too long.
[0:13:05] Rhewiz: @D0P4MINE i dont understand what you are saying ahhaha - you like seeing the same classes all the time? or would you like a buff for ranged classes (warlocks, mages, priest and shaman) so there would be a chance for them to be in the "META", instead of seeing same stuff over and over again
[0:13:05] Telomir: @Kahlandra 'ello!
[0:13:06] Drakedog_KR: yes we need to do +25
[0:13:07] Red_Queen____: I am so hyped, I cant wait for these games anniesHug anniesHype anniesHype anniesHype
[0:13:12] kiyoix: Sleepypan btmcAYA
[0:13:20] Fierced: @oxBrutalxo i never said that. this is a 18. They need to be really quick, double rogue gives everything you want, high utility, great interrupts and high damage to do big pulls. High keys is a different story. Why do you think Gingi for example still mains hunter, or Jay still plays mage. Cuz they still work really well, but rogues are just superior in 18's.
[0:13:30] Dumpsterr: shamans cant be meta in mdi they cant be night elves

[0:13:51] HiddenDonutSpy: @sleepypan Pog goodnight no1KAY
[0:13:53] UHMW: you cant make classes balanced for m+ unless you make changes that ONLY apply to m+
[0:14:02] Rob_USMC: Hello
[0:14:03] UHMW: currently ranged are top dps in raids... what about melee there?
[0:14:04] karosnos: rebroadcast ? or not ?
[0:14:08] Antramedes: shakibCOMFY
[0:14:08] Sleepypan: @wolf_ayaya NITEEEEEEEEEE
[0:14:11] Doipa_: @Rhewiz that wasn't even my argument. I'm not sainyg the current MDI meta is entertaining to watch. All i did was tell you why this meta exists. these classes are the most well rounded and fastest at killing the dungeons in the mdi. Its the speed that matters

[0:14:21] Somestalkerchick: @catgodsusunakub no
[0:14:22] Fierced: it has nothing to do with them being unable to play nelf, casters in general lack quick damage for 18's. @Dumpsterr . besides 2 teams had a elemental shaman main and it didnt work out to well for them either.
[0:14:24] Telomir: @catgodsusunakub not a rebroadcast. Live in 1.5 mins.

[1:50:00] Telomir: Dont blame the classes. Blame dungeon design + the overall goal of MDI.. to complete dungeons as soon as possible. Lets just enjoy the competition for what it is. Yes, class variety would be nice, but these are the optimal comps we're looking at here.

[2:26:05] Telomir: @flawlesslykun @Vandorionn in any competitive environment (esp time based), a converging meta will always arise with 1 to n teams, based on content design. Based on the nature of BfA dungeons, its not surprising that the existing meta exists (these 2 teams - the WW or DK variant) - its just how it is. Might see more with engineering rez, but due to restrictions, Rdruid is optimal, TC prot warrior is essentially a quasi 4th dps and tank built into one.. and the utility of rogues (esp shroud) is

[4:02:36] Celestial990: @cause_gg LUL Yeah belf was just fine in legion
[4:02:36] hgg33: wow this dungeon looks insane, ive only done zul'gurubso far but i really like it and hope i can do it on m+2 later today

[4:02:38] icorpsecamp: @AutomaticJak Being critical of mistakes is perfectly fine. How you are critical matters and tonight it's coming off very negative. To be fair, I'm also being very critical of the commentary and negative towards the commentary, so I guess I'm doing the same thing. I'll try to be more positive about how I critique you all.
[4:02:39] hedonictreadmill_: i don't even know if there's a japanese localization, i don't think it's their kind of game
[4:02:41] nuclearkitten: doesn't buff war have two more deaths?
[4:02:41] Hyphixsys: interrupt: the mmo Kappa
[4:02:42] Trohuz: shadowmeld is only so strong because they're speedrunning like this, it's not nearly as good for pushing
[4:02:44] mallardbane: this pull is bonkers
[4:03:04] coten0100: push it to the limit
[4:03:06] highvoltage988: @csstoker I dunno if there's any Japanese players, but Blizz doesn't have dedicated Japanese servers. Western MMOs don't sell well in Japan
[4:03:06] DoraMLTBX: Clean
[4:03:08] mallardbane: so nice
[4:03:15] onegee: @icorpsecamp No one cares LUL
[4:03:32] mobalord: if horde can have better raiding racials for years, why cant alli have the best myth+ racial for the next decade?
[4:03:34] The_Environment: They need to change it so shadowmeld doesn't stop reaping
[4:03:39] alien13tcd2: @mobalord Its so inbalanced though that no horde group can compete. shadowmeld saves more than 3 minutes in most dungeons. thats equivalent to each dps having like 6k more dps...most racials are about 1/15 of that
[4:03:48] Dethlock32: @csstoker they r to busy playing League LUL
[4:04:12] icorpsecamp: @onegee Are you saying I'm no one? LUL
[4:04:17] Kahlandra: alliance have gnomes kahlanGnome
[4:04:19] mobalord: there are also 0 myth raiding guilds on alliance and it all started with not nerfing troll berserker a decade ago, so why act now for shadowmeld?
[4:04:34] mallardbane: @alien13tcd2 does it matter though? it's only for mdi that people went alliance. on live servers horde dominates the m+ and raid scene
[4:04:35] highvoltage988: @mobalord because the solution to one side being OP isn't to nerf them to the ground and make the other side OP instead. Though with Warmode apparently Blizz isn't aware of that
[4:04:35] alien13tcd2: @mobalord Also arcane torrent was so op with silence because there wasnt as much extra trash in other expansions, but now the ability to stealth/skipp is stronger than anything else

[4:05:07] Kahlandra: kahlanGnome
[4:05:08] MissReece: nb should have meld too. i guess they forgot how
[4:05:16] Arcaedio: wow interesting
[4:05:17] mallardbane: hard to get an all night elf team and it's only useful if everyone is night elf
[4:05:27] highvoltage988: Gnomes are food, not friends SMOrc
[4:05:33] Trohuz: nborne racial actually useless slootPH
[4:05:39] SimpleSimplify: Horde crying that their racials aren't the end all be all anymore LUL
[4:05:40] mobalord: just dont nerf literally the only good alliance racial when horde has the best raiding racials since a decade, unless you want to be horde biased
[4:05:54] dogmaster9000: imagine complaining about pve balance as horde lulw
[4:05:57] lumbago_1: o

[4:06:14] cause_gg: gg
[4:06:24] Mceternity: GG
[4:06:34] Narisko: so is @Warcraft just gonna ignore the massive time delay caused by a bug against Buff War?
[4:06:46] Trohuz: @Bacon_21 slootSmug ikr, the non-combat one is actually the good one
[4:06:46] Arcaedio: the group comps just show how clueless the balancing team is

[4:06:52] highvoltage988: honestly I don't mind SMeld being the go-to meta for MDI, despite how good it is none of the leading teams on Live are faction swapping for it
[4:07:02] alien13tcd2: you guys are delusional if thinking shadowmeld compares even remotely to any other racial lol, even when horde racials were op it was never more than like a 3% overall difference, shadowmeld is more like 10% faster mythic runs than anythig else
[4:07:07] Nemesis_: @Trohuz slootYum
[4:07:18] coten0100: i think accompany might win
[4:07:19] cause_gg: exactly shadowmeld shouldn be nerfed like arcane torrent shouldnt have been nerfed
[4:07:23] dogmaster9000: @alien13tcd2 and yet horde still dominates m+ on live
[4:07:25] Trohuz: @Nemesis_ slootYum
[4:07:40] Narisko: @coten0100 yeh because Buff War had the combat bug
[4:07:43] Hyphixsys: quinThinking
[4:07:43] Narisko: so it's not fair
[4:07:44] leftkickcemetery: snoozefest
[4:07:45] lLLIDANGODX: @alien13tcd2 reported
[4:07:45] Rogash95: i feel like they misunderstood how they lost that much time, it looked like the monk didn't have LoS to rezz from the water and so he had to wait for sanguine to despawn before he could get up and rezz
[4:07:48] Celestial990: Shadowmeld is so OP 4Head Everyone is gonna go night elf on live now...oh wait
[4:07:50] serverfirst300003: what this channel could improve is information about players, i can see their gear and talents, but i wish i could see total amount for each stat
[4:07:56] hgg33: im a professional mythic plus player and i spend my time in twitch chat teaching other twitch chatters how to do dungeons in WoW, if u want to support me pls pm me for my paypal email
[4:07:58] XDfane: horde dominates M+ bc horde dominates pve in general so everyone plays horde
[4:08:00] bubblesthebelfwarrior: pushing high keys and maxin time on a 18 is diff
[4:08:01] Miketron: smeld can be replaced with death skips in most cases, it's nowhere near a 10% advantage
[4:08:05] alien13tcd2: @dogmaster9000 because who willingly plays boring human races, you can do that in real life :P
[4:08:06] hedonictreadmill_: smeld gonna get nerfed soon or every MDI from here on out will be NElf teams
[4:08:09] ashix_xoxo: its 180% not 90% !!!
[4:08:23] alien13tcd2: @Laarryy Please go ahead lol if that was offensive i dont know what to even tell you
[4:08:29] dogmaster9000: @alien13tcd2 so lets nerf meld and entice even more people to swap horde
[4:08:33] mobalord: horde deserves the worse racials also for raiding so people faction swap back again, this includes making troll berserker nightborn level useless
[4:08:34] Hyphixsys: @persolan quinThinking quinThinking
[4:08:39] Narisko: @hedonictreadmill_ kinda like every horde racial for raiding? I think not
[4:08:41] Koorndog: xyronic and nagurra actual good casters
[4:08:53] ironskull84: nerf cat weaving
[4:08:58] blunsv11: spec stacking shouldnt be allowed
[4:09:04] XDfane: imagine playing alliance for anything other than the MDI LUL
[4:09:09] coten0100: classic combat bug
[4:09:21] jabbaa_the_hutt: @mobalord sak d
[4:09:25] alien13tcd2: @dogmaster9000 A difference in power shouldnt be the deciding factor of faction, it should be story/appearance difference/balanced but different racials
[4:09:37] Rogash95: well horde doesn't rly have that much bette racials anymore, it's just that they had better racials so top players using that are all playing horde and if both sides are equal there's no reason to swap back
[4:09:56] Vaesker: Vol’Zith such a scam - doesn’t even whisper KappaRoss

[4:10:05] dogmaster9000: even with the difference in power the faction is still worse so
[4:10:08] Tooldealer: Man, that Hunter sure is doing a lot of damage.
[4:10:15] Luvon: I mean that's also because blizzard charges a massive amount for faction transfers
[4:10:27] Luvon: If faction transfers were free you'd see a lot of people go back to alliance
[4:10:32] Hyphixsys: RIP
[4:10:40] coten0100: do they do it over since there was a bug
[4:10:47] mobalord: free faction transfers for alliance would make a lot of sense actually
[4:10:47] Narisko: If it weren't for that death they'd have had a chance if @Warcraft compensates them for that rez bug fairly

[4:12:19] Narisko: @hedonictreadmill_ Buff War got combat bugged and couldn't rez their healer
