[9:05:59] luk1s: its funny
[9:06:47] luk1s: i think the only solution for developers is gonna be changing the ways games are made so its less Shooting and more objective based

[9:10:58] luk1s: i mean devs gonna have to work with the presumption everyone will have access to the AI tech and make their games more complex so even if you are tracking everything through 3rd party soft
[9:11:36] luk1s: you would need human input
[9:13:17] luk1s: like wow ATM too old of a game concept (ye still the best and fun to play) but already figured out by bots that just got better overtime

[9:14:37] yog1f1sh: dont gotta bet pressed, i was just wondering why you thought that
[9:15:10] luk1s: maybe make openworld just story based leveling process with no drops no and no gold and just gate everything behind max level like new zones. Also make raids to drop consumables and such idk wow need a new concept
