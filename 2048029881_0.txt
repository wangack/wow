[0:21:30] Jyger: Yep
[0:21:39] silversagee: shamans gonna pop off

[0:22:13] hazzard02: but duel wield still going to be significantly better, especially because were getting maelstrom
[0:22:35] Xantten: Excited to see some SoD gameplay live finally! :)
[0:22:44] flaretv__: one thing that saddens me, though - there's no AP to SP scaling on shaman yet. which makes maelstrom that much worse
[0:22:44] Alkisfadern: Alarm Alarm Alarm
[0:22:46] NeilDeGrasseTyrone: boost me PepegaCard

[0:33:11] HybrisTV: but what staff will actually police this?
[0:33:15] fLx_t: last time I played people were selling armor runs. they stack your raid with people of the same armor group that dont need anyhting and then trade you the stuff
[0:33:25] otuz19: @Prefoxfox I am brother of Edi. He send all of you regards and he will be back when his account get unbanned. He got ban because he said something bad about LBQT and he wanna to test if media control TWITCH. He got his answers after ban.

[0:34:37] Creoxx: nah they didnt release all runes tho right?
[0:34:47] 2icezy: the feral rune gives 15% dmg when u use tigers fury and 60 energy
[0:34:51] Seline88: They only showed 2 runes per class. Probably a lot more to be discovered
[0:35:50] Stugem: yes
[0:35:50] Altijdmiss: It's not
[0:35:51] Xantten: Warriors have 5 on Hands and 3 on Legs
[0:35:53] janqlowsky: it should be atleast 3 per slot for every spec pretty much
[0:35:55] shanu91: warriors have 5 on hands

[0:36:43] Jonn_nner: 2 is unethical enough PogO
[0:36:45] hazzard02: i can hear the hurt in his voice
[0:36:46] Nightbot: Follow my IRL adventures at https://www.instagram.com/prefoxfox/ Okayge

[0:37:38] Jonn_nner: not even using faerie fire while running PogO
[0:37:59] 2icezy: what is ur shifting macro?
[0:38:10] fibbopaladinos: this is probably a test run for cata if they will implement it there aswell
[0:38:12] fibbopaladinos: the gdkp
[0:38:46] Creoxx: Robokus SR KEKG
[0:38:49] Jonn_nner: I know a few really good ones, but most of them are after work hours YEP
[0:38:54] DjUrsu: imagine they implement like a tax on the gold your characters has
[0:38:56] amzelhut: can i go to jail for gdkp?
[0:40:05] Jonn_nner: @amzelhut YEP
[0:40:50] athania01: healer was afk

[0:42:31] Shouqs: i'm so happy they ban gdkp, cancer of classic
[0:42:39] Creoxx: 20 euro for 30gold KEKL
[0:42:46] Pixet: SoD developers seems to be more intune with the community overall
[0:42:55] AilosDK: Theres no way they would have the manpower to monitor the amount of gdkps in wrath lol
[0:42:56] Jonn_nner: I'd be more happy if they banned gold buyers, but it's a nice first step ReallyNice
[0:43:48] hazzard02: huuuge
[0:43:50] Jonn_nner: !roll xffing
[0:43:50] Nightbot: Jonn_nner rolls 14 (1-100)
[0:43:53] Shouqs: @AilosDK i thnik it's pretty easy with the quantity of gold trade in such short time
[0:43:54] Moscowwbish: streamer instance
[0:43:56] Creoxx: streamer host luck tsk
[0:44:22] DjUrsu: @Jonn_nner they don't have employees to detect gold buyers. And AI is probably not reliable at the moment
[0:44:24] Moscowwbish: yes. there are a ton on wild growth, which isnt even a giga competitive server
[0:44:28] Sharrak0r: yea gdkp spam is pretty obnoxious
[0:44:37] athania01: since 1st week there were gdkps in sod
[0:44:46] shanu91: maelstrom weapon in p2 for shamans PauseChamp
[0:44:49] Jonn_nner: @Jonn_nner One day COPIUM
[0:44:51] shanu91: maybe we can lava burst weave now
[0:45:07] Seline88: Almost no GDKP on Crusader Strike EU
[0:45:14] Moscowwbish: they also make it really obvious with 15g increments that they're gold buyers ICANT
[0:45:25] vhndiesel: buying gold was less rampant in vanilla i feel
[0:45:30] vhndiesel: people actually farmed gold
[0:45:32] shanu91: wait lava burst is included in sod version of maelstrom weapon Pog
[0:45:35] shanu91: so instant lava bursts inc
[0:45:57] swedishviking345: that is GBID
[0:46:09] HybrisTV: how would people know if that even happened?
[0:46:11] Sharrak0r: the powerpoint slide mentioned gbid as well
[0:46:12] Dj_Oo__: I dont think they will allow any ''trading'' with the players inside same lockout
[0:46:13] Shouqs: put personnal loot on classic and fuck all thoses HR / gdkp trash kid
[0:46:24] AddictedToZugs: paypal raids just bid in a discord then pay out $$
[0:46:32] greg50537: @Shouqs agree
[0:46:43] CabsHere: you mean to say i cant chose how i spend my gold? if i want to pay someone for a item they won in a raid that is not allowed? sounds like a rule blizzard cant enforce
[0:46:56] AddictedToZugs: method started the whole loot selling thing in cata looks like thats where it'll start right back up
[0:47:53] Sharrak0r: that's a good question, will offering gold to buy someone else's loot in a SR run also get you banned then?
[0:47:56] vhndiesel: it wont exist next phase
[0:48:01] Wavy_Sinatra: ^
[0:48:11] xsv_21: New rune, King of the Jungle will be insane though without the helm regardless
[0:48:18] xsesTV: you cant get the specialization needed
[0:48:34] hazzard02: well, they said they wont allow the profession specilisations right away
[0:48:34] Creoxx: @Sharrak0r depends on how they plan to do it, maybe they'll get rid of the 2 hour window to trade items
[0:48:36] hazzard02: so maybe later on
[0:48:43] forever_yeet: Susge
[0:48:45] Jyger: They also added battle chicken as a trinket in gnomer
[0:48:46] Gaffies: EZ
[0:48:48] itsXekko: EZ Clap
[0:48:48] Stugem: yeah even with 225 lw cap you couldn't get it but now they especially said no profession specialisations

[1:25:51] Fujicakess: oi oi oi oi
[1:25:53] Moscowwbish: tiger's fury
[1:26:02] shanu91: blood surge
[1:26:06] Moscowwbish: off gcd + 60 energy + 15% dmg increase
[1:26:07] kurjade: tigers fury
[1:26:08] 2icezy: tigers fury
[1:26:09] Moscowwbish: 30 second cd
[1:26:10] StripSniper: tiger fury
[1:26:19] Pixet: King of the Jungle fundamentally changes your Tiger's Fury by increasing all physical damage you deal by 15%, as well as instantly granting you 60 energy. As a trade-off for this, Tiger's Fury now has a 30 second cooldown.
[1:26:22] fossland: ah sick
[1:26:24] kurjade: yea
[1:26:24] Moscowwbish: yeah the wotlk version
[1:26:24] 2icezy: 15% dmg when u hit tigers fusy
[1:26:28] StripSniper: yes 60 energy 15 dam
[1:26:28] 2icezy: plus 60 energy
[1:26:39] shanu91: and off gcd Pog

[1:27:20] Moscowwbish: like pala blessing duration increase, and rogue combo point redirect
[1:27:23] neferiian: Blood surge could be OP. Quick strike benefits from the same triggers as Heroic strike, which would give warriors even more chances to proc wild strikes with now free slams added
[1:27:30] fossland: hunter trap launcher KEKL
[1:27:31] Xantten: Trap Launcher makes me not want to play Hunter in case it's meta :D
[1:27:42] Xantten: Also more gambas please friends
[1:27:45] Fujicakess: i hate hitting slam as a war
[1:28:01] Xantten: I hope they suck

[1:28:10] Creoxx: trap launcher and available in combet
[1:28:12] fossland: in combat aswell
[1:28:13] Creoxx: combat*
[1:28:17] neferiian: @Fujicakess Well now it seems u can proc it with quick strike too. + its insants and free, and it dosent go on ur swing timer
[1:28:20] fossland: cumbat graycenMilk
[1:28:46] t0bby: entrapment + trap launcher = 10 hunter nerfs all over again
[1:28:58] t0bby: also traps don't share cd with each other
[1:29:20] Fujicakess: whats your plan with no gdkps now? just gonna run with a guild?
