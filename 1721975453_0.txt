[1:20:02] NewWorldReign: Make them white.
[1:20:22] tehrobtar: @boblongmvp right? lol... like i need them to eat solid food... how is that cosmetic? xD though i guess if you still have the majority of your teeth, you could still do solids.. but still rofl
[1:20:47] NewWorldReign: You know that music producer Simon Cowell, he had that procedure done years ago hence why his teeth are so white.

[1:22:03] EmpathyLiveChat: Interesting. I had fillings as a kid without anaesthetic and it did hurt. Now I'd demand it.
[1:22:13] tehrobtar: @boblongmvp i've always said insurance is a scam rofl.. especially like home insurance... we got dropped by ours last year because they replaced our roof, as suggested by their adjuster, and i guess they didn't like that rofl
[1:22:15] BobLongMVP: You can be a Gigachad irl but when it comes to teeth / nerves in your mouth pain it‚Äôs a wrap!! Lol
[1:22:28] tehrobtar: insurance is great until you have to use it... then they don't want to pay up lol

[2:29:17] CeruleanStar: day 1 we 1 shot it lol

[2:30:32] ladyevilll: normal/ heroic?
[2:30:42] Dave_Growl: 4 stacks is the best i've done
[2:30:47] mozavich: @ladyevilll lfr
[2:30:48] Synaerio: @daconcion The simplicity on any difficulty, is to analyze and adapt... Sad to say but it's no different than life.
[2:30:55] darkpoolz: @tac2cul2 ty vm
[2:31:37] mavericks312: @Synaerio yea but thats an ancient way of thinking now in games
[2:31:57] id_invaded__: @mavericks312 nonsense
[2:32:05] CeruleanStar: tbf day1 was still mostly full of people already clearing N who were missing tier off brood/raz lol
[2:32:14] CeruleanStar: i haven't attempted again :D
[2:33:08] Synaerio: @mavericks312 Not true
[2:33:40] mavericks312: @id_invaded__ look at most games these days outside of soulsborne games, accesibility and player count are more important then if you can make a challenging game for try hards, especially when casuals make up most of the population
[2:33:41] TheItalianStallion321: fuckin Max joined this LFR last night with 5 stacks of determination, doubled the DPS of the 2nd person on the charts and 1 shotted it. only him bro...everyone else has to suffer thru this lol

[2:34:47] id_invaded__: @mavericks312 no clue what games you play,I don't play the same
[2:35:58] id_invaded__: Stacks should not exist :P
[2:36:10] Synaerio: @mavericks312 This statement is completely false... Unless you're playing games designed and made for children... Sorry not really
[2:36:15] mavericks312: @id_invaded__ doesnt matter take WoW for instance most of wows pop is casual players thats why the game is alot more casual friendly then it was in vanilla an bc and its for the better
[2:36:37] Laelas_sm: fight checkpoints?
[2:36:39] TheItalianStallion321: yeah, a 1 button skip. fuck this last boss LFR shit
[2:36:40] Laelas_sm: instead of stacks?
[2:36:48] id_invaded__: @mavericks312 project what ever you want bye
[2:36:54] mozavich: @mavericks312 what are you smoking? casual doesn't mean lack of strategy/analyzing. lol
[2:37:17] Waspire: 3 down
[2:37:18] id_invaded__: Dude is rude to people without even realizing it
[2:37:19] Waspire: err 4
[2:37:21] Synaerio: @mavericks312 and WoW is not casual friendly lol
[2:37:28] Maxoru0: meh, I'm ok with stacks being part of the lfr. It
[2:37:32] GravityRelapse: this fight is so long üò™
[2:37:39] id_invaded__: @synaerio bad take
[2:37:56] Synaerio: @id_invaded__ don't care
[2:38:04] Maxoru0: It would suck even worst and would be unplayable at that point
[2:38:05] mavericks312: @Synaerio wow is completely casual friendly now
[2:38:19] Beastafied: nothing wrong being casual in games. don't let anyone tell u different.
[2:38:19] Waspire: 5
[2:38:58] Sylphy_TV: LUL Troll
[2:39:32] Synaerio: @mavericks312 No, they make systems later to appeal to the casuals later on after "their" targeted audience finishes the end game content of the current tier
[2:39:52] Mikayyy: @Beastafied for real lol. people act like you cant enjoy games if you're not trying to be the best
[2:39:57] CardinalTX: Im super casual and i think the game is fine right now. I dont even do M+. Enough casual play and plenty to do if i decide to get sweaty
[2:40:23] ashwing_: Only 3 determination stacks for a kill Pog
[2:40:39] TheItalianStallion321: people dont know to just walk into the lightning and use a defensive
[2:40:40] Ertra: yay grats
[2:40:51] Maxoru0: @GravityRelapse at leas its not sylvanas lol
[2:40:56] Ertra: second on dps
[2:40:59] id_invaded__: No clue why any of you think casual = do braindead things LUL
[2:41:03] Maxoru0: nice! gratz
[2:41:26] Synaerio: @id_invaded__ ^
[2:41:33] paintman550: shows up boom
[2:41:48] mavericks312: @id_invaded__ braindead no easier yes and thats completely fine
[2:41:49] blazyturtle: i got a legion legendary from running M argus for mog and it genuinely surprised the shit out of me lol
[2:41:55] mozavich: @mavericks312 maybe in the past, but not for DF. do you even play DF bro? super casual friendly right from the start.

[2:43:44] xyogger: have to get the primal chaos as well to craft gear
[2:43:44] NVbrutal: yea i have had to do 30 +16s just for my weapons on 2 characters lol
[2:43:50] Synaerio: @mavericks312 Casual aspects does not equate to casual game. Yes the OW "content" is casual, but end game is not designed for casuals, and thats the only part of the game i indulge in. Depends on where you as a  player sit both activity and skill wise.
[2:43:54] id_invaded__: @mikayyy make your own opinion
[2:44:04] daconcion: It's between 40 and 80 dungeons if you're entirely insistent on getting all crafted gear to 405 before moving to 418
[2:44:08] daconcion: And that'
[2:44:12] Mikayyy: so alts should just have enough gear to run 16's from the start?
[2:44:17] daconcion: is assuming yuou're starttng with 11s
[2:44:20] Needdaann: I like to solo stuff for 2 hits, they hit me and I hit the ground LUL
[2:44:35] Gillrad: Primal focus and primal chaos should be tradable to alts with a HEAVY ratio. I have 3k primal chaos and hundreds of Concentrated primal chaos on my main doing nothing in my bags.
[2:44:42] Masqerader: still think the hardest content in this game are damn trees  in dungeons
[2:44:49] Gillrad: Concentrated primal focus*
[2:45:29] smashwow: barrier of entry alts to get into comparable content that you're doing should be lower if you've done all the work on your main.
[2:45:30] zeiours: people left my key because I said is anyone getting harry potter, just trying to make convo...
[2:45:31] CeruleanStar: so what quest(s) do you ahve to do on alt to unlock esence drops? just doing all the essence quests ?
[2:45:40] id_invaded__: @masqerader don't play it like rts LUL
[2:45:44] strike879: why did you use the rep item on war? best to send to an alt as the paragon boxes are useless now
[2:46:28] rbailey_2222: good morning
[2:46:36] mavericks312: all you see now is raz mounts and black flight drakes
[2:46:51] inj0shwetrust: that sinew is alot of gold
[2:47:04] strike879: just complete the renown on alt and get it for free
[2:47:09] warrenny: @mavericks312 Want theblack one but cba grinding it rn
[2:47:19] Molvonos: lol
[2:47:21] illusion1990: they dont
[2:47:22] abracka_: 500g and a primal chaos
[2:47:23] Masqerader: they should allow us to use drake/dragon skins we already have for appearances
[2:47:28] inj0shwetrust: My paragon bag was underwhelming as hell
[2:47:29] Elff11: If only
[2:47:32] Molvonos: towCopium towCopium towCopium
[2:47:33] Senthius09: best we can do is 7 dragon isle supplies
[2:47:33] CeruleanStar: it has the crafting mat thing
[2:47:37] illusion1990: i mean maybe i shouldnt say they dont idk for sure
[2:47:47] strike879: nope
[2:47:48] Eviltuna13: pet supplies
[2:47:50] illusion1990: ive gotten a couple without getting one though
[2:48:10] Elff11: I opened 3 paragons this week, 0 sparks Sadge
[2:48:23] mavericks312: DH was feelin frogy lol

[2:49:17] smashwow: so short answer no spark Kappa
[2:49:19] Eviltuna13: yup
[2:49:24] illusion1990: they are terrible
[2:49:32] inj0shwetrust: Mine was about the same
[2:49:33] id_invaded__: It is bonus not goal to farm.
[2:49:34] strike879: yea why do you think we say its not worth and best to send to alts
[2:49:35] manmower: just send them a picture and caption it with "bruh"
[2:49:42] CardinalTX: Thats good....keep it up and thank you!
[2:49:45] GravityRelapse: whats why I don't do world quest. the rewards are trash
[2:49:48] CeruleanStar: it at least puts it on their radar to chedk on
[2:49:50] NVbrutal: they should have made it were we can just buy the crafting sparks with 500-1k primal chaos lol would atleast give us something to dump chaos on then.
[2:49:56] Syprus1: ok yes it is underwhelming we need to add more supplies
[2:49:59] Synaerio: Target Audience perks
[2:50:00] inj0shwetrust: I was like ..... what ... a weekly obsididan cache was higher value than this..... how?
[2:50:01] NBK_Sethus: tbh I'm positively surprised with the amount of hotfixes so far, they're on top of most things
[2:50:06] daconcion: These packs all have garbage rewards, the supplies system feels ass because they're basically useless. I have like 15 or 20k supplies, and have spent 0 of them
[2:50:08] Molvonos: Or you can wait 3 weeks of no vault and get a spark!

[2:50:51] Syprus1: @daconcion agreed i dont even bother with renown or looking for things outside of herbs and mythic+
[2:51:15] NBK_Sethus: we badly need the profession knowledge reset, at least on a monthly lockout or something
[2:51:20] manmower: supplies should purchase useful consumables
[2:51:22] TheItalianStallion321: IMO they are really fuckin with Evoker. they have a few bugs since BETA and still exist...and its problematic to our rotation

[2:51:42] Valzark: i think its fine
[2:51:43] id_invaded__: Stretching low content that is why
[2:51:47] Aquadriel: one week earlier doesnt buy bobby a yatch
[2:51:58] warrenny: Its only too long if you dont do content
[2:52:03] manmower: only if you gear and clear on ALL your alts too fast
[2:52:13] smashwow: people are unsubbing because of the inverse of that though.
[2:52:15] Im_Donaldo: Chat you think if I want to pvp as the same class I pve on should I make a entirely new class so I can utilize catalyst and vault better?

[2:52:39] Yagr6: i quit when they stop respecting my time
[2:52:40] strike879: whats needed more then a knowledge reset is a knowledge catchup if you start a char now you are 80+ possible points behind from all the weekly knowledge quests
[2:52:48] inj0shwetrust: They do need to adjust the valor system a bit too
[2:52:59] faulen: by the time they get to 395 the next patch comes out and there is a new grind.
[2:53:01] GravityRelapse: RNG vault
[2:53:08] manmower: that's the poll they should give players
[2:53:11] faulen: casuals are not 395 yet
[2:53:15] CardinalTX: been playing some FF14 again   LUL
[2:53:18] zevaz177: its working rn
[2:53:21] mayonaes: it works everytime for me
[2:53:22] Synaerio: @Towelliee thought on Sub rogue being gutted and reworked into a Tank Spec?
[2:53:23] Skylin3r: maybe that's the problem, that the end game system is your ilvl
[2:53:26] CeruleanStar: took me a few server hops but got it yesterday
[2:53:27] smashwow: there's not really a reason to nickel and dime a player period. if the game is fun people will play just to play.
[2:53:28] inj0shwetrust: At the very least let us get 1k a week.  If you play Fury.... you cant even do 1 weap upgrade weekly.
[2:53:32] Yagr6: why play now when i can just play in like a month when i can farm enough valor
[2:53:32] inj0shwetrust: thats down bad
[2:53:36] TeejayOCE: not working on my server lol
[2:53:37] Angryfist40: took me like 5 times to get this world quest to work lol
[2:53:44] Laluzmia: it is bugged still srry to say
[2:54:04] manmower: it's working
[2:54:05] Cower311: ?
[2:54:05] Sazuret: Yeah its still bugged
[2:54:07] zevaz177: its not
[2:54:12] CeruleanStar: mine still worked even tho it had this behavior
[2:54:13] BlueBlurPrime: you have to wait till both are active to attack, bird activates early
[2:54:15] manmower: trust the process
[2:54:22] inj0shwetrust: if amaa has hp you should be fine
[2:54:23] Bayne77: it was bugged last night
[2:54:26] daconcion: How did they even break this quest, it was working for me for the first 3 weeks perfectly every day
[2:54:28] daconcion: then jus ttopped
[2:54:34] CaptReddBeard: its been broke for me
[2:54:40] id_invaded__: @yagr6 pretty much a d not enough valor drops
[2:54:45] inj0shwetrust: Told ya
[2:54:46] Masqerader: no it stops at 1%
[2:54:57] Sazuret: Huh mine was completely bugged
[2:55:00] aero3132: I've only seen it bug once when they both perma stunned at 3%
[2:55:01] inj0shwetrust: now they will sit there and not despawn lol
[2:55:08] inj0shwetrust: but youre gucci lol
[2:56:28] inj0shwetrust: Layer hop for it as long as you can dps it down to 1hp you will get the quest done.

[3:27:43] tnasty15: I thought we‚Äôd see a lot too
[3:27:46] PidiaP: Because ele has to pick between single target or aoe and enh just gets to do both
[3:27:54] tnasty15: I‚Äôve seen 0 since patch
[3:27:59] mavericks312: idk man i feel like you dont see many shamans in general
[3:28:02] Scarhearth: enhance is just so much better imo alot of dungeons need funnel damage more than flat aoe
[3:28:10] SlideCancelXDD: enh sham just too good rn @Towelliee
[3:28:13] Mikayyy: i was ele, until i realized how much better enhance actually is
[3:28:45] Mikayyy: ele is really fun though, but either aoe or ST will suffer BADLY
[3:29:10] Mayorbeeohyayy: !maccros
[3:29:21] Mayorbeeohyayy: !macros
[3:30:03] daconcion: The forced choice between AoE and ST is one of the reasons I stopped playing my hunter, I shouldn't have to choose between 0 AoE with good ST and bad ST with good AoE

[3:30:28] cthyt7: Hey Towelliee. How are you doing?
[3:30:49] daconcion: @AlphasaurusRexx And then you do 0 damage eitehr way because you're survival
[3:30:54] nevercluckyy: i love how survival hunter has talents for barrage but cant even use it
[3:30:59] wEiRdO_dUdE: EZ clap
[3:31:13] AlphasaurusRexx: @daconcion thats completely wrong. survival does really good damage
[3:31:21] SlideCancelXDD: that trinket is sim bait @Towelliee
[3:31:23] chabouy: Have you had any luck on bottles/sparks yet
[3:31:27] daconcion: It really doesn't compared to BM or MM

[3:32:07] Kydar: TRUE, I didn't even think of that, neat
[3:32:25] daconcion: It doesn't do damage compared to the other specs, and provides no additional utility, so there's no value to the spec
[3:32:36] tnasty15: Surv hunter literally pumps
[3:32:48] daconcion: Like, sure play survival if you want, but it's less than optimal
[3:32:56] SuperLost89: no shockwave?
[3:33:03] AlphasaurusRexx: @daconcion you are very ill informed and just echo chamber what the forums say
[3:33:05] Mikayyy: @daconcion who cares man lol, you only play top specs?
[3:33:33] faulen: yeah and you should be happy for them, they got good loot!
[3:33:38] Mikayyy: i've been toying on a surv hunter a little bit, i think its a fun spec
[3:33:51] smifflezz: i farmed so much dirt trying for a spark, i dont think they exist
[3:33:53] Big_Wanshan: I HAVE SOOOO MUCH METTLE
[3:34:13] daconcion: I've played survival this xpac, it's not as good as MM or BM, it doesn't have additional utility so there's no reason to swap to it if it's going to be worse than MM or BM for damage, and yes, I choose to play the optimal specs for classes
[3:34:14] kimmo_gaming: get crafted gear with bis stats
[3:34:17] joe_g_433: joeg433 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 4 months!

[3:34:25] rosina_scarlett: I'm calling 10.1 we can trade primal chaos and infusions to alts
[3:34:31] strike879: you use it for crafting gear
[3:34:39] TheCliffyShow: Me
[3:34:42] inj0shwetrust: Ill go on my hunter
[3:34:46] Jerseyguy187: I will!
[3:34:52] Aquadriel: you gonna get 2 sparks in a week but no primals KEKW
[3:35:02] rosina_scarlett: can I come on my 380 rogue?
[3:35:10] AlphasaurusRexx: @daconcion at what level did you play survival? because the survival in my guild is always top 2 dps in high keys. absolutely smoking most specs
[3:35:23] Broomba: what gear level is minimum @towelliee ?
[3:35:27] strike879: the crafting blue gear also gives +6 skill each so that helps allot with proccing upgrades
[3:35:29] PidiaP: Yeah I guess I can go on my shaman cause we skipped normal this week I‚Äôm 402
[3:35:32] rosina_scarlett: I'm 7/8H just don't need anything on war
[3:35:47] Snabido: Can they have a hidden weekly cap
[3:35:50] inxszane: I can be healer.
[3:36:09] daconcion: Other than my weapon being a lower ilvl for surv, it's 399 MM/BM vs 397 Surv, the 397 Surv is substantially less than MM and BM, and again, doesn't provide any additional utility to justify the damage loss

[3:37:26] Broomba: i guess i will run with lulas guild on normal raid, need to get gear
[3:37:34] AlphasaurusRexx: it provides enough utility to do everything. your stats must be borked for surv or the raz bow is just busted then. i digress, play what you want
[3:38:01] rosina_scarlett: I'm not saved my guild just doing heroic
[3:38:32] daconcion: I don't have the raz bow unfortunately, but I have bad rtrinkets for MM and Surv, true, my trinkets are better for BM, but MM is just more damage overall, and has the same utility with added benefit of being ranged for mechanics
[3:38:58] rosina_scarlett: i got a N vault run on my rogue with Zeroes to heroes in 2 and a half hours xD
[3:39:05] Clay2K_: @towelliee ah ok. I‚Äôm still behind on the whole crafted gear thing lol
[3:39:06] itsmiraix: Men these lag spikes are so annoying
[3:39:09] rosina_scarlett: but we should 8/8N by then
[3:39:18] Kelticlore: My rogue is 385 with his 4 piece
[3:39:41] AlphasaurusRexx: @daconcion yeah the ranged benefit i get. If you havent played surv in a while and you really love your hunter i urge you to try it again. esp after the buffs it got
[3:39:45] ohnot___her: heyimahunter big pumper

[3:40:52] daconcion: I've played Survival as recently as two days ago, it's not better, it is fun, sure, but I also think MM is fun (BM isn't, sadge) but yeah, i did swap to my DK because it's just more damage for me and has utility still, plus much better survivability
[3:40:55] jarilrpg: @Shrenko you are only limited with embellished gear

[3:45:07] daconcion: Aimed shots is nice, technically until you're above 50% crit the expected damage return on DT is better used on Rapid Fire, but DT was a 1 min CD
[3:45:08] wEiRdO_dUdE: derp
[3:45:09] Shrenko: but you are forced into the steady shot talent now
[3:45:10] AlphasaurusRexx: @AlphasaurusRexx -_-

[3:46:27] notdustinx: its playable
[3:46:29] AlphasaurusRexx: @daconcion shit i wish it hit that hard XD
[3:46:30] daconcion: Overall Hunters are more consistent in keys now because we get Trueshot far more often

[3:47:21] wEiRdO_dUdE: GW2 has some cool mount stuff, I can see why it was "borrowed" for Dragonflight LUL
[3:47:26] tyraell91: Guild Wars VS ESO
[3:47:34] notdustinx: in gw2 you can insta que pvp at lvl 1 with max stats

[3:47:52] Derca_: yeah, DF clearly took inspiration from skyscales lol
[3:48:35] Bayne77: towel took that abnormal left earlier and is now feeling saucy with the counterclockwise
[3:49:08] wEiRdO_dUdE: But yeah there is a lot of little stuff in GW2 that is kind of annoying, like having to carry around 100 shovels and 100 of other gathering tools
[3:50:12] notdustinx: lmaoooo
[3:50:42] wEiRdO_dUdE: Nice ring
[3:50:48] Taaser1: what are these bottles?

[3:51:43] wEiRdO_dUdE: Back in the day, Guild Wars was hardcore
[3:52:31] abracka_: yeah ESO/GW2 have the best mog systems in any MMO honestly
[3:52:53] qufad: Open World events and also Instanced Content ist pretty good in GW2 too imo
[3:53:05] wEiRdO_dUdE: Can people dye their gear in FFXIV? WoW might be the only one you can't change gear color in
[3:53:05] Moobot: Towelliee is rocking the new Logitech Sona Mic! Check it out at https://imp.i125364.net/Yg5neP Click on Blue and check out the Sona Mic !!
[3:53:08] rjd33: i spent more money on GW2 than any other game
[3:53:43] theDirtyon3: ESO just has SO MUCH tmog
[3:53:49] N3llee: dying the gear is another level
[3:53:57] Kelticlore: I prefer D3's transmog system
[3:53:57] qufad: costumes and transmog in GW2 is cracy good, so beautiful
[3:54:05] theDirtyon3: whether is bought/crafted/dyed
[3:54:07] Daniel_Drago: One week can you do a carry run? I am having a hard time getting out of LFR and am basically in LFR/Crafted gear. I'm not looking to spend money and every pug I try and join they kick before we even start because people Bitch about my 379 item level
[3:54:18] Daniel_Drago: like carry normal, nothing crazy
[3:54:35] Skylin3r: it would make the FFXIV fashion weekly too easy
[3:54:55] Bayne77: what are sparks? Kappa
[3:54:56] warrenny: I skipped the quests
[3:55:00] kimmo_gaming: I just wish if something was a recolor, just give me an option to paint it, not to collect the whole different set
[3:55:02] frognite: ya but u need primals...
[3:55:04] Vipervenom2u: no idea how to use sparks
[3:55:06] Syllvn: iirc it's still just not possible in FFXIV due to how item data is stored. They have stated they want to do it, but not sure if they can.
[3:55:07] csd_fustian: everyone has 5 sparks?
[3:55:07] james_bah: what profession you need for that?
[3:55:10] azurrei: no primal chaos, sparks are the easy part
[3:55:12] james_bah: i never did it lol
[3:55:12] Daniel_Drago: hmm, I screwed up then cause I used catalyst lol
[3:55:13] N3llee: @Daniel_Drago you are playing the game wrong
[3:55:14] Molvonos: Yes, everyone has five sparks.
[3:55:16] Vipervenom2u: not joking
[3:55:16] Armdel: i vendor the sparks i get Kappa
[3:55:18] rares2fast: How do you do that?
[3:55:21] RageerPLZ: @frognite not for 392, which is base, just spakres
[3:55:21] Molvonos: If you do the quests, you get sparks.  Quests are easy
[3:55:24] james_bah: what to do with sparks? i have 5 but dont do professions
[3:55:29] Molvonos: Sparks then are used to make crafted gear.
[3:55:38] TheItalianStallion321: by this week , every character has the availability to have 5 sparks
[3:55:41] ohnot___her: Blows my mind when people think they should just get gear without doing anything
[3:55:47] abracka_: you can also run mythic+ for gear, if you don't want to traverse into  the 10 and beyond range, hover around m7-9 to farm 385-389 ilvl gear to bump it up a bit too
[3:55:57] james_bah: do you need to craft them yourself with a profession? @Molvonos
[3:55:59] JimKappa420: you dont need profesion to use spark just go to crafting table
[3:56:00] Daniel_Drago: @Daniel_Drago I mean I'm casual but want to experience the game on a slightly higher difficulty
[3:56:09] N3llee: wowhead has a great guide on sparks. if you havee questions it will answer them
[3:56:23] ohnot___her: Daniel_Drago, run mythic plus best way to gear imo
[3:56:27] Molvonos: @Guyladriel Nope, you can use the crafting board system to have other people make them for you
[3:56:36] Snabido: They introduced crafting work orders this expansion, go hit up an npc trader in valdrakken for that

[3:58:50] LinearCitrus: I still don't 100% understand the crafting system
[3:58:51] Shrenko: its really easy imo if you just sit down and get into it
[3:58:55] KrakonSkullz: Hell no they didnt i feel lost in this Expansion
[3:58:59] MrTrevinoo: The crafting needs to be explained in game not through blue post
[3:59:05] kiwimeister13: what difficulty is he doing?
[3:59:09] csd_fustian: where do you get the sparks? in valdrakken?

[4:00:24] Roaringkittylol: lol influencers are suppose to work as a complimentary tactic not as the sole information hub...
[4:00:26] kiwimeister13: is this heroic or mythic?
[4:00:28] IzuMeister: i didnt do beta - but looking stuff throught before you put permanet talents , tends to be a good idea :D
[4:01:02] wEiRdO_dUdE: Blizzard support really does send people to WoWhead, they did that to me when I had an issue in Shadowlands
[4:01:08] Oegn_: probably meant from a social interaction point of view, helping newer players and stuff..
[4:01:13] c0mmander_starscream: "Everything I learn in WoW is from my Lord and savior Asmongold" ....
[4:01:32] chippchappi: mythic?

[4:22:02] TLew02: Eagles run defense is terrible
[4:22:04] danoh_64: genos or pats
[4:22:11] mavericks312: cowboys only sacker was parsons
[4:22:12] T3X_87: you are righ tin sacks
[4:22:12] superpudd: I'm a die hard Eagles fan, wtf does Purdy being exposed mean? He's a rookie that is balling out. I do think our D will get a ton of pressure but 'exposing' him sounds silly
[4:22:16] c0mmander_starscream: geons
[4:22:19] TLew02: if deebo/CMC get going, could be the turning point
[4:22:20] manmower: i think KC gonna stomp bengals
[4:22:24] c0mmander_starscream: Genos
[4:22:24] Yagr6: i want bengals and eagles match up
[4:22:27] Mitchendo64: Purdy is kind of popping off
[4:22:39] mavericks312: @theDirtyon3 but pressures dont mean shit if your not getting home
[4:22:41] nitemare34godd: @Towelliee question i want to us a new email for my second time for u in the raid game do i need to click on your raid link again or because i already clicked the link today do i still have to again trying to help out

[4:22:47] c0mmander_starscream: Philly cheese steaks for all
[4:22:51] bigstick258: shananan is king of coaching average qb's. its about shanahan not purdy
[4:22:52] hollywood__cole: If the Niners can run the ball, the Eagles will lose
[4:22:58] xALcaPWNedx: I think the 49ers pull the upset - 49ers Bengals Super Bowl
[4:22:59] mavericks312: the real thing is wait for a shanahan mistake casue god knows he had a bunch ]
[4:23:04] chessboxin34: niners skill position players are whats to worry about, deebo, mccafery etc can take a slant 50yds
[4:23:19] inj0shwetrust: Fish up the frog?
[4:23:21] superpudd: @hollywood__cole 100% dude, we need to stop CMC

[6:09:38] xmedpakx: i am glad ppl cannot respec crafting atm ,ppl have focused a spec and if anyone can swap freely if would screw ppl over who made a name for themselves trying to specialize
[6:09:42] strike879: i get why because then ppl could put the points in getting full points in 1 item slot reset then do the full points in the next slot repeat so if you want to blame someone do so to the no life min maxers

[6:10:56] DevilSpire: is the mage tower still in the same location?
[6:11:03] GingerGambit: @towelliee do you think Black Rook would make a good m+ dungeon?
