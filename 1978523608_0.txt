[1:27:19] NorikM: oh you have 0 bombs? let me give you 569079234 things to bomb
[1:27:35] stoney_entertainment: yes
[1:27:47] Radund01: So what is T laz's gimmick?
[1:27:58] uselessend: !tlaz
[1:28:10] stoney_entertainment: !tl
[1:28:10] Nightbot: Tainted Lost does NOT start with holy mantle, has "better" items and a holy card (1 time use holy mantle). Cannot find most defensive items normally such as holy mantle, dead cat, gnawed leaf, etc. Cards have a 10% increased chance to be holy card instead
[1:28:16] preauxton: Upon clearing  a room, tlaz essentially swaps between two separate characters, each with their own items
[1:28:20] stoney_entertainment: nope wrong one lol
[1:28:28] NorikM: LUL
[1:28:36] Radund01: @preauxton Yikes.
[1:28:40] stoney_entertainment: i tried damn it
[1:28:40] Kitkitten_: !tlz
[1:28:40] Nightbot: Tainted Lazarus is 2 characters in 1 body basically. Items, stats and trinkets are separate, auto swapped every room clear (wave in greed/ier) or you can use Flip active in the bottom right to force it.
[1:28:48] Kitkitten_: I had to look it up
[1:28:52] stoney_entertainment: i was one letter off LUL
[1:28:54] Kitkitten_: Dral has a million commands

[1:29:57] stoney_entertainment: cobalt7
[1:29:58] Kitkitten_: @omegamango_ OUCH
[1:30:01] Kitkitten_: that sucks
[1:30:04] Radund01: So from what we just saw if we can flip to the other form of laz we can also get an item for that other form.  So essentially 2 items per room that holds an item?
[1:30:14] stoney_entertainment: 27/30
[1:30:26] Grassandsafetypins: Hey cobalt! BibleThump
[1:30:30] Why_is_Barb_Yelling: rewarded cobaltPOG
[1:30:49] preauxton: @Radund01 but not all pedestal items have that second item behind, and you cant always flip for every item, so you usually end up with less items per char overall
[1:30:59] omegamango_: @Kitkitten_ think ill need amputation to snow the pain away
