[5:36:12] 1_Dementio_1: @DexterStJock Yeah arena gets tournaments because blizz is tryin to push it as an esport since its against other players. The last time I remember them doing stuff for pve in terms of irl was Siege. But I mean like in general the attention to raids is crazy even though theres no reward like tournaments
[5:36:18] grundlesauce: @DexterStJock me too brotha, but it's the long on the side thing that's hurting him
