[2:20:13] ClassicMalcontent: @Gengisman there is a 'wrath hc' but its 'not the real HC' heh. Some took the rules and tried to roll with it. But, yeah. I know there is a Wrath HC but its a smaller subset and arguable if anything other than original is or can be 'HC'. Vast majority of HC is and means Classic (vanilla based) as intended.

[2:23:24] ClassicMalcontent: @Gengisman I mean I don't personally play HC but I have my 'museum toon' L60 warrior and hunter to 'HC observe' hehe. I play casual in wrath and goof around in classic. But mostly retail. It's all good for those who want to do HC. Hope they enjoy it!
[2:23:25] procyon_mfc: I dunno what elsee drops if anything

[2:25:06] Dwaggle: The road is fine
[2:25:07] ClassicMalcontent: @Shirkzy not sure his current server but in theory any Classic (vanilla based) realm. Just need the HC addon and signup to confirm the rules are followed.
[2:25:20] potnudel: no
[2:25:25] SicDogg: best HC char is stealth ability

[3:48:10] Sollice: Who knows if you duel you may get experience thats deemed outside of the rules lol
[3:48:55] deforson: open world PVP is fine. So, yeah, you could duel but seems like a bad idea out in questing areas
[3:49:21] mattanzza: If you die in a duel, do you have to delete the character?
[3:49:22] Tyrou: @Towelliee there is a path bewteen the mountains that you go up

[3:49:39] Hebrewish012: you can if they set a fire under you :D
[3:49:39] thedamndudedevin: Correct
[3:49:41] ty_ston96: you can die in a duel but its rare
[3:49:46] Tyrou: it's possible to die in a duel, i saw 2 warriors dueling and died
[3:49:48] deforson: Right, You don't die, but being that low on health.. I've never done it on any of mine when out in the world.
[3:49:48] vagamingpanda: Is this a special server in regular classic?
[3:49:51] FreeMont: nah dungeon is not that hard because u do it at high lvl than mob
[3:49:54] notdustinx: Bugs can cause you to die
[3:49:58] xhaven: still love the voices lol
[3:50:05] thedamndudedevin: Have to watch out for people trying to get you pvp tagged
[3:50:07] notdustinx: Just don’t duel lol
[3:50:12] FreeMont: for example DM u do it 20-22 and mob are 16 if i remember
[3:50:14] deforson: How much variation is there on the voices it's generating? Quite a bit?
[3:50:28] Hebrewish012: what how is the quest voiced over  O.o
[3:50:28] Tabaron: Do you think Blizz will take down Voiceover addon
[3:50:36] Jargoyle_: What Addon is that for voice after quest dialog?
[3:50:44] Hebrewish012: immersion !
[3:50:49] deforson: @Hebrewish012 AI-generated voiceover via addon.
[3:50:53] notdustinx: If you use battle shout on a friendly pvp tagged played do you get tagged ?
[3:50:53] LordOverflow: the cursed gnome area
[3:50:57] DecayedmiNt: Why would they?
[3:50:58] robertjordan83: @Towelliee didnt they kill belluar's version?
[3:51:07] xhaven: Im saving the addon however hopefully they let it saty its so much better
[3:51:08] DecayedmiNt: They killed that because it was paywalled
[3:51:09] abracka_: nobody was paid for their acting either
[3:51:18] Sollice: Because people will start saying :Awww why aren't all quests voice acted"
[3:51:23] The_Dane_Train: Could argue it’s for accessibility
[3:51:37] Sollice: and I actually could see voice actors having a huge problem ai voice generated NPCs
[3:51:38] Hebrewish012: @Sollice I mean they should be for immersion
[3:51:40] Syllvn: @robertjordan83 They killed that because he was going to MAKE QUESTS and CONTENT not just voice stuff
[3:51:59] Hebrewish012: yeah voice actors rip for sure
[3:52:01] idiedbyrune: what about quest guides then u have to pay for
[3:52:11] Onawanis: I'm like 99% sure torgy is Mitch Jones mage

[7:19:53] KontrolStyle: @Sollice, rofl
[7:20:21] Sollice: Why I am not joking. Why would you want AI voice to be in games if your a voice actor.

[7:20:52] Airwaive: bro
[7:21:17] Sollice: @NoTToXiCLuL No i know what you mean. But it;s like Ai anything. You start with one thing and it will continue to go. If I can have an AI voice actor and pay nothing and it sounds just as good as a person, why have the person?

[7:21:25] llNoTToXiCll: that would be stupid
[7:21:37] Sollice: That's why artists are up in arms about AI art

[7:22:37] llNoTToXiCll: that was my point
[7:22:43] Foretoldlegends: And certain countries are banning AI related stuff as a whole. Because we're advancing to far with it without consequences.
[7:23:02] Sollice: Of course. That's why I say AI voice as an non blizzard add on fine...But I doubt you will see it sanctioned and as a normal even for mundane side quests etc
