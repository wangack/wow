[0:45:42] stonymontana_tv: i bought a house in south carolina for 168k very big and beautiful
[0:45:53] stonymontana_tv: 4 percent interest
[0:46:03] PapaBeks: 300k house = $140k approxmaity in income a year for base approval

[0:46:43] dubramaster: I cant afford to buy anymore - my girl and I make almost $150K a year - its insane.
[0:46:45] AMG444: screwed capitalist society lol blackrock owns everything
[0:47:02] AMG444: big firms buying up all property controlling housing
[0:47:28] dubramaster: uh oh - you good?
[0:47:33] dubramaster: :)
[0:47:59] atlknight1: Correct AMG, corps are buying properties up quickly.
[0:48:07] sewer_creature: whenever it looks like a dangerous pull, i make sure to lower the volume just a little bit :D
[0:48:25] stonymontana_tv: i mean if you can buy house buy a house lol you never know how much equity you can gain in just a year
[0:48:25] Arathmis: @AMG444 I dont agree thats a capitalism problem. Thats a lack of regulation problem. We shouldnt be allowing chinese industry to buy land in the us
[0:48:29] PapaBeks: 1 in 3 residential homes in the US is owned by one or 3 banks now
[0:48:45] stonymontana_tv: my house is up 40k in less then 1 year of buying nothing really done to it
[0:48:46] atlknight1: There is a huge correction coming though, home values with drop by 30%+
[0:49:03] AMG444: @Arathmis lol its our own people screwing us too, and our people allow chinese to buy up all the farm land
[0:49:05] ootinee: That's what I got right now besides the garage and storage space it's all connected to my house but my rents went up from 1750 originally now it's 2200 a month
[0:49:25] PapaBeks: @AMG444 or its a wave of OVER regulation that makes it so difficult to buy, that only entities with major funds can afford to do it

[0:49:49] stonymontana_tv: dayum haha
[0:49:54] Arathmis: @AMG444 There are some businesses buying property but no where near the scale the chinese government is doing it. They are investing heavily in property here because they can't buy property in china
[0:50:05] atlknight1: Just plan on always living in your parent's basements
[0:50:08] stonymontana_tv: my mothers house we put some work into it bought it for 70k now worth 278k
[0:50:13] Cowardpatty: And with that $200k, you could buy a shack
[0:50:32] rickebooi: what monitor are u using? g9?
[0:50:33] Ava52: off to work, catch yall later
[0:50:38] stonymontana_tv: im sad its a childhood home i dont know if its worth even selling it in this market even if its a 150k gain
[0:50:40] Cowardpatty: Later Ava!
[0:50:49] AMG444: @Arathmis lol or it cant be people at the top making deals to get a piece of the pie from the chinese while they sell us out
[0:50:56] ootinee: @atlknight1 Haha, Acutally at a rough time during that rent change my parents were trying to tell me to come back and live with him it's normal nowadays well i pulled every string to not let that happen haha
[0:51:29] stonymontana_tv: i blame COVID haha
[0:51:41] AMG444: blackrock is the cancer of society
[0:51:42] snusinmylip: didnt you have a house in mexico once
[0:51:53] Arathmis: @AMG444 Im sure there are some politicians getting kick backs. All the more reason to forbid sale of property in the US to china
[0:52:13] AMG444: @Arathmis 10% to the big guy hahaha

[0:57:48] atlknight1: The tent ⛺️ is for me, 😆
[0:58:21] Airwaive: so many people say "I pay 1800 rent so why cant I buy a house"
[0:58:38] Airwaive: because owning a house is far far more than paying the mortgage payment
[0:59:27] HitmanGSMike: I'm almost think about buying some land and using the new travel trailer i just bought to live in until we can build one lol
[0:59:35] Spart4nm4n: OH NO YOU ARE OOM!
[0:59:43] HitmanGSMike: Building a house*
[1:00:01] atlknight1: It's achieving the down-payment that's tough. Unless you can live with family or inherit money or save for 10-20 years
[1:00:10] Airwaive: you need cash flow to maintain the place
[1:00:14] PapaBeks: bc CBO's never ended, they just repacked and rebranded them. They kept doing the same stuff that caused 2008, they just got cute how they did it.
[1:00:17] rassiraimo: because banks are crashing like flies atm, inflation is high etc
[1:00:26] Yomoboshi: so the 2008 crisis does not happen again

[1:16:49] Drascho27: no
[1:16:56] BigFatRestoCow: Blizz is part of shatter. You do need to take on alot of mobs to make it worth it.

[1:17:50] BigFatRestoCow: Idd. not @ 15...
[1:18:09] Drascho27: Frost nova + flame strike + cone of cold and then finish with arcane exlposion. Way better. Mobs move outside of your blizzard alot and it burns mana
[1:18:55] Lexon7: I already made two 60 mages on hc. both in shatter spec.
[1:19:53] weahhc: I thnik you very well
[1:20:07] Lexon7: yea but u dont need to always aoe farm. that crit from shatter + ice barrier is very sweet and cozy
[1:20:39] BigFatRestoCow: Mobs move outside your blizzard if you dont know how to corral them.
[1:20:54] Drascho27: yeah you can go frost for the survivability but blizzard for aoe is not efficient
[1:21:07] younglettuc: Swift if u enjoy are farming on classic u will like it in wrath u get living bomb instant flame strikes blast wave that can trigger flame strikes instant cone of cold blizzard and dragons breath for ape stun as well as arcane explosion
[1:21:17] BigFatRestoCow: According to you.
[1:21:39] Lexon7: wow token bleh :P
[1:23:14] Markfooz: people buy gold already in classic (a lot do) at least with tokens ur buying from players nd not bots/farmers

[5:42:52] Elson_Vi: @darknova7777 you can run each dungeon once
[5:43:00] Mecabeast: do the dungeon rules change when you hit 60 so you can farm gear or no?
[5:43:05] einWicked: hey one question.. how long you think the lvl 5 wand is viable?
[5:43:05] Deatth1: If you die on mage would you remake mage again or a different class

[5:44:06] TheGraciousLOL: do you still workout?
[5:44:08] Rogtar_: Hola swifty
[5:44:13] Elson_Vi: It would just make BG's an arena with perma death
[5:44:18] neevir: After this wow token thing, I have no faith in blizzard for hardcore
[5:44:24] OliverOnAir: You made me realize that I had to prioritize my health as well whilst being an avid gamer as a kid, thank you for that. I was really stubborn before listening to you
[5:44:26] VoidCraft: people will just buy gold with tokens and buy everything, thats sad
[5:44:54] tabbin__: how would a bg even work with perma deaths lol
[5:45:10] JuanSebastianKing: @Elson_Vi BGs would be full of rogues with op ambush and vanish :D
[5:45:12] Rogtar_: Near rachet swifty

[5:47:42] Mecabeast: i think it would be easier with AV not sure about alterac or wsg
[5:47:44] tchikaboom: maybe make it so if you get 5 deaths or something in bg you get perma death
[5:47:51] neevir: You rock Swiffer

[5:48:13] twitchmanx: Hey Swifty, I'm really excited for the upcoming WoW Hardcore Classic. I wanted to ask your thoughts on the decision to enable the auction house and trade only at level 60. Do you think this will make the game more challenging or less accessible?
[5:48:48] tabbin__: im mad about that, ive been ranking and now that they said that its pointless i wont make r14 by then

[5:49:37] newkingcody: theres no way they allow hc characters to pvp with the other servers. if you are hc you would avoid all fights and never help your team. Your team would be at a disadvantage and you would be griefing your team playing that way.
[5:49:40] Mecabeast: also do we know if we are getting naxx from the rip for the new official hc servers

[8:31:17] Drascho27: @Lzhealz no, no death
[8:31:42] Drascho27: @Lzhealz there is no pvp in the hardcore community
[8:31:42] Murvan91: 3 months away from 3 year subed to your channel
[8:31:53] Drascho27: @Lzhealz except duels
[8:32:06] BigGoon: scariest part of AoE grinding is resists
[8:32:09] Lzhealz: @Drascho27 but you kinda not die in a bg. you get ress and all thta stuff. so sad to hear you cant do pvp
[8:32:23] rainingjesus98: first time watching your stream i enjoy it. theyre really good against melee but not really against hunters
[8:32:29] Drascho27: @Lzhealz no it's is a death

[8:33:33] Drascho27: Yeah
[8:33:37] rainingjesus98: if you can stay out of distance of nova and cone of cold. then mage cant do much. although they do have blink and sheep. but hunters usually poo all over them
[8:33:43] Drascho27: except duels
[8:34:07] Lzhealz: @Drascho27 so super pvper never play hardcore XD
[8:34:55] wy6ix: U can turn pvp flag on right? But it's way too risky
[8:35:03] Drascho27: @Lzhealz Some do. People play hardcore for the challenge. It's just a different challenge than pvp.
