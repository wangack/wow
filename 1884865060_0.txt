[0:50:29] moderatygos: the new tweet hasn't been released yet so i can't update the bot command :-( the new dungeon is uldaman
[0:50:31] DaBo00: @ChopperYami then it's not updated yet :)
[0:50:32] Sebleh: Can I start banning people? naguuraCope
[0:50:49] DaBo00: @ModeraYsera calebdLaugh haha yea, it's an old copy pasta
[0:51:07] ArnesMeyer: @royaltoasttv uldaman
[0:51:11] weRmuh: @ADDICTED_HYDRA_SPAMMER you can only extract the true pvoker data from the extended data logs, which are not availeble for addons
[0:51:12] shmmeker: @ADDICTED_HYDRA_SPAMMER no its a support spec that buffs party damage output and cooldown reduction and defensive wise
[0:51:21] weRmuh: you can see it on WL Logs when they are up.
[0:51:38] shmmeker: also details aint shows dragon damage properly
[0:51:42] ADDICTED_HYDRA_SPAMMER: @proteinloadedfart LuL  WHAT a  bad desing

[0:52:20] PelPet: Was that to start RP?
[0:52:27] Torqez: How do the keys work in TGP?  Like, can they just choose whatever they want to run?
[0:52:30] DaBo00: @ADDICTED_HYDRA_SPAMMER TL;DR is that this new spec of evoker buffs other people, and details show that as those other people doing more damage (which is technically true), but in reality the reason the other dps do so much more is because of the evoker :)
[0:52:44] ADDICTED_HYDRA_SPAMMER: @weRmuh imagine your job in he dungeon is to be a walmart healer LUL

[0:53:14] picc0: @ADDICTED_HYDRA_SPAMMER you might wanna educate yourself a bit more on evoker and what they do
[0:53:21] DaBo00: @Torqez they all start with a 22 key, and they push keys by timing runs, depending on how fast they do it, the key gets upgraded by 1, 2, or 3 levels
[0:53:22] weRmuh: @ADDICTED_HYDRA_SPAMMER :P

[1:01:50] frriiedd: itsa not losing 1.5 dps if you lose a dps in a aug group... cause the evoker isnt = 1.... its the same thing as losing 1 dps go look at warcraft logs LOL

[1:03:24] st_cynical_one: so, the lesson we are learning is bring an aug so they can die
[1:03:28] Sleepypan: trying to remember what the other bosses did
[1:03:36] Ghamera: @gelloz_ no one is making you sub and/or play
[1:03:49] crossTTA: @frriiedd Aug dps is based on the dps that they give to the other exodia dps, if you lose one of the people contributing to your warcraft logs overall then you do a substantial amount less dps as well on top of losing one of your dps.

[1:22:52] Meeix: im back and ready
[1:22:53] magicianrtv: @x_Scy yes, but sadly for most people the 457 and 450 trinkets from last 2 bosses are a "must"
[1:22:55] Sleepypan: because u can literally craft 447s and get 447s from doing weekly 16s atm
[1:22:56] Meeix: how are we doing
[1:23:00] Sunaruqtx: @apriloneil11 wdym you can do 27s with 444 ilvl which is possible to get with heroic only LUL

[1:24:45] Alcara1993: i got my 5 socket out of the vault so there is plenty of room to get 445/446 iLvl overall
[1:25:02] WorgenDeath: @WorgenDeath I mean that is the case for lots of other classes aswell, their biggest issue is just that they don't bring any unique valueable utility so their viability lives or dies by their pure numbers tuning

[4:30:31] Meeix: we good
[4:30:39] Sleepypan: watching teams on equal footing in a true test of skill seems boring @cozy_nacho ? id rather see teams not lose because another team has a broken class
[4:30:42] Thomas_Huayra: Paprika's are just a type of large bell peppers that are a lot less spicey and more flavorful
[4:30:53] myStiC_o: HC Ashkandur or 447 Crafted for BDK?
[4:30:57] Alsryth: @cozy_nacho Optimal CDs, damage, survival, etc..
[4:31:01] Nocteran: Lots of group diversity this season!   Glad to see such class/spec representation. /s

[4:31:41] JimboJ12: @Sleepypan Too much to ask to not have a 'broken' class I guess?

[4:43:32] Ghamera: @tettles it was a full wipe on vex
[4:43:39] EpicBlueMouse: I kinda hope they change more specs to pure support, like Spriest could be support and you would have to decide between Aug or PI rooThink
[4:43:44] Alsryth: American pro-Football (Grid-iron) 31 of 32 teams use the same optimal comp.
[4:43:45] sniffi90: So nerfs did nothing to the meta? Still the same comp everywhere? :(
[4:43:58] wdog: Crazy we can't watch the screen he was talking about.
[4:43:59] Coldsu: they full wiped to 2 kicks going off on the triple pull before vex

[4:44:48] Cydonion: @EpicBlueMouse Why take away the only dps specc from priest. take 1 one of the healer speccs ?
[4:44:51] Supcore: why are we looking at Last Moment? literally not fighting for elim or first
[4:44:57] Brozoxs: @tettles  it was on the trash before vex

[4:46:03] Bendie_EU: @clicky91 And you're still here
[4:46:07] EpicBlueMouse: @Cydonion As a Spriest main, I still think it would be better. Could have shadow lose PI and make another support class, but each healer spec does something diff
[4:46:34] Clicky91: @Bendie_EU because i cant open two windows at once? kek cope harder

[5:02:24] N00B_L0RD: i just joined, which team killed fishface yet
[5:03:01] moltencrucible: @GM_Sabbat you say so, but then people on live keys try to make the same comp in +22 man
[5:03:02] Alsryth: @wyqed - Points are only scored for completing in time I think.  Teams are also on a daily competition clock.  Time ends in about 20 minutes.
[5:03:08] celexinator: its fine I guess, not like im competing, just shows how unbalanced things are among classes
[5:03:08] PelPet: No Fishface to my knoledge
[5:03:09] yo_shame: @siriaktwo these classes were not OP during the MDI you clearly dont understand that this would be  the MDI meta too
