[0:39:58] Ahbe: @Raikubest Must be cus u stopped smoking weed finally after many years
[0:40:23] georgeyboy: for 99% of the playerbase though who arent r1 the bracket is so diluted cos of shuffle
[0:40:27] georgeyboy: I think ultimately bad for the game
[0:40:31] yourhorror92: many players quitted because of solo shuffle, im talking about the avarage players
[0:40:52] nightmoonx11: @yourhorror92 Shuffle is the only reason many people are even subbed, and it's actually a more challenging bracket than 3v3 skill wise
[0:41:00] sistahfistah1: Shuffle is the only reason many people are even subbed, and it's actually a more challenging bracket than 3v3 skill wise
[0:41:11] nightmoonx11: 3v3 biggest challenge is to actually find people to play with LUL
[0:41:16] Ambiantzz: shuffle has its moments, but ultimatly its good just to play without LFG shenanigans
[0:41:19] yoko1ono: Got Jebaited by strim title, damn dh gamers always lying
[0:41:21] alexhomie: diluted /dʌɪˈl(j)uːtɪd,dɪˈl(j)uːtɪd/ adjective (of a liquid) weakened by the addition of water or another solvent.
[0:41:25] sistahfistah1: shuffle rating is alot harder to get than 3v3, 3v3 r1 is 2.9k shuffle r1 is 2.8k
[0:41:42] Dyazah: teammates hide a lot of skill issues, solo shuffle exposes their gaps in knowledge
[0:41:48] Icetomeetyu: but im a fucking sp :( cman man
[0:42:08] nightmoonx11: @sistahfistah1 Why you meme'ing what i said? :D Shuffle is literally a more pure test of skill than 3v3
[0:42:11] yoko1ono: Got Jebaited by strim title, damn dh gamers always lying
[0:42:21] Icetomeetyu: im 2.1 my dh friend is 2.5
[0:42:29] sistahfistah1: @nightmoonx11 yes i believe you :) im with you brother trust me !
[0:42:34] randomagee: i mean solo shuffle raiting isnt even that hard lol
[0:43:04] nightmoonx11: @randomagee Rating never meant much in Arena anyway, it changes value every season. It's all about percentile
[0:43:08] yourhorror92: @sistahfistah1 you are talking shit sorry to say that
[0:43:10] skronze: the title is so unserious FeelsOkayMan
[0:43:13] nightmoonx11: Getting 0.1% in shuffle is equally or even harder than 0.1% in 3v3
[0:43:31] Dyazah: @nightmoonx11 agreed
[0:43:55] randomagee: @nightmoonx11 all r1 solo shuffle doesnt mean u can get in 3v3
[0:43:59] nightmoonx11: No right, getting r1 in 3v3 as Turbo is the hardcore stuff LUL
[0:44:01] randomagee: way easier
[0:44:15] tichoka: Why they cant inflate every season like SL s1,s2, just let ppl be glad, they a 3.6k xp player wont invite a 2.4k xp glad player anyway
[0:44:16] nightmoonx11: @randomagee How is it easier? LUL
[0:44:20] tichoka: at least ppl would get their rewards
[0:44:31] nightmoonx11: @Raikubest WORD
[0:45:02] nightmoonx11: Exactly. In 3v3 you choose comp, partners, which is much easier than playing with random comps and people
[0:45:14] yourhorror92: @tichoka i think the player numbers in pvp dropped sharply compare to shadowlands
[0:45:19] misterro2008: 3v3 r1 100000% harder then r1 shuffl
[0:45:27] nightmoonx11: @misterro2008 It's not
[0:45:40] nightmoonx11: @misterro2008 And tell us how many R1 shuffle you got :D
[0:45:48] tichoka: @yourhorror92 cuz even r1s were 2.3k for the first 1.5 month of the season :D
[0:45:48] sistahfistah1: yes shuffle is SO much harder to get rating, i am hardstuck 2k in 3v3 but in shuffle i cannot get higher than 1.8k

[0:47:06] Dyazah: @Raikubest I've always been curious, what keybinds do you use to target and focus arena 123?
[0:47:40] nightmoonx11: It's actually unbelivable people think 3v3 is more test of skill than Shuffle. A bracket where it's more about having the right comp + friends being more "skill" than a bracket where everyone gets equal shot... my God, people are f*ing stupid LUL
[0:47:52] tichoka: So there is ppl left who actually binds target,focus instead of doing it in settings
[0:48:10] nightmoonx11: I played close to r1 in 3v3 many times without voice even. Much less hardcore than shuffle, which is a fucking struggle with the chaos
[0:48:10] abohassanx: tabar du inte targets?
[0:48:17] yourhorror92: how it comes that end of ssn 1 1.8xp rets got 3500 cr in solo shjuffle und you are telling solo shuffle is harder than 3v3
[0:48:27] tichoka: idk(?)
[0:48:29] alexhomie: @nightmoonx11 but its also some skill with communication and stuff that 3v3 has
[0:48:33] nightmoonx11: @yourhorror92 LOL proof?
[0:48:46] tichoka: I know it was like this for ages
[0:48:46] nightmoonx11: @alexhomie Comms make it easier, not harder
[0:48:53] Thaaranduil: what is your arena1,2,3
[0:49:00] misterro2008: @nightmoonx11 go f urself oka
[0:49:38] nightmoonx11: @misterro2008 Mad cus bad, why don't you go play Turbo to 2.1 in 3v3 with your loser friends ok?! :D
[0:49:53] Dyazah: @Raikubest Do you mainly use focus macros, or do ou lean toward arena 123 for Imprison/Sheep/etc.?
[0:50:00] nightmoonx11: Also people don
[0:50:05] tetr_m: ㅈ
[0:50:16] nightmoonx11: People don't understand rating is relative. Some people got 3.2k in BFA and now stuck 2.2 in normal 3v3
[0:50:28] sistahfistah1: when was the tourny 1st or 2nd?
[0:50:38] monbe123: are u done with ur study? @Raikubest
[0:50:42] tichoka: So why macro target/focus instead of settings? U just used to it by old times?
[0:51:09] abohassanx: skulle du säga att dk är op?
[0:51:56] Thaaranduil: where are u from raiku?
[0:52:30] Dyazah: @Raikubest Do you mainly use focus macros for CC, or do you lean toward arena 123 for Imprison/Sheep/etc.?
[0:52:31] Thaaranduil: so...a zlatan guy at all?
[0:52:48] EstexX28: you only listen to one song ? @raikubest

[0:53:31] JuiceRiderr: it's a spotify angle brother
[0:53:54] tichoka: spotify top 100 global? its kinda similar to ur music taste as i can see
[0:54:30] diskmachin1: spotify "songradio" i an elite feature
[0:54:39] nightmoonx11: @Raikubest That was the response I was looking for
