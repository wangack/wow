[0:23:07] Calphurnious: Do you guys think I'd get a good fps increase going from a 1070 to a 4070 in WoW?
[0:24:12] nevercluckyy: i would imagine calphurnious but i can't really confirm or deny it as i switched to amd once they got all of the bugs worked out
[0:25:25] Calphurnious: @nevercluckyy Which one did you get? I was debating getting a 4070 or a 7900xt
[0:26:48] nevercluckyy: i got the 6600 and it runs wow on ultra just fine
[0:27:11] nevercluckyy: like 120fps (low to some) works for me though
[0:27:49] ZeusDNA: @Calphurnious Yeah, you should see a pretty decent bump in fps doing a jump like that
[0:27:59] nevercluckyy: i caught it on cyber monday sale at my local best buy for $85 last year
[0:28:17] pandaren79: It depends on what res you playing for 1080p 4070 is decent
[0:28:59] xaryuplaytft: @Calphurnious go for a 7800 XT, it was abig upgrade to my 1080ti and under $500
[0:29:03] Calphurnious: I have a Microcenter next to my house, they usually got great deals in there. Yeah my MOBO is capped out with upgrades and the only thing I can do is gpu unless I build a new rig
[0:30:15] nevercluckyy: when it comes to the 1000 series geforce cards most of the even low end cards you can readily find now are at least an upgrade

[0:30:57] nevercluckyy: big thing is like you said double checking compatibility with MOBO
[0:32:13] nevercluckyy: only issue i have after building my pc i have now is when i ordered the parts i failed to buy an SSD to go with it and loading screens are the devil in wow without an SSD
[0:32:48] superpudd: Can I get a GO BIRDS!?
[0:32:49] Calphurnious: @nevercluckyy Yeah, they're compatible for sure, it'll just be bottlenecked a bit by the other slower components. I've just been gaming things like dead cells, slay the spire with the occasional wow so never really needed to upgrade

[0:49:55] pruteee: What is cool is there is alot of people 7/9
[0:50:02] ambiotic: they quit around 10
[0:50:06] ZeusDNA: Think 23.9 or something around there was their best
[0:50:08] ambiotic: 23% i think
[0:50:27] Thewunk: Morning @Towelliee
[0:50:43] ambiotic: max says its one of the best fights in wow history so they enjoy progging
[0:50:51] digaboom: i mean honestly why not just lock the last two bosses for the first weeK/
[0:50:53] Bowwjack: @Towelliee there was a lot of fucky shit that happened last night as they got to those close %'s as well, I seen at least 2 or 3 attempts where seeds instantly popped into trees after spawning
[0:50:54] ZeusDNA: I hope we see Fyrrak Thanksgiving morning and he cooks a turkey every respawn
[0:51:00] SamuraiWillZ916: So is blizzard the wwe? Scripted?
[0:51:11] ZsGamingCorner: Hi towelliee
[0:51:18] Wulfgrym: yeah, feelts scripted by wow, bad move
[0:51:23] mavericks312: whoever made the tandril fight deserves a raid
[0:51:47] Thoreya: ^ its the same guy who did halondrus, sludgefist
[0:51:55] Thoreya: echo new best 30%
[0:52:08] ZeusDNA: @Thoreya I thought max said the guy who made Fyrrak is the halondrus guy
[0:52:10] TweektheProphet: yeah max said he is reclearing today
[0:52:12] nevercluckyy: 31.6
[0:52:21] SamuraiWillZ916: How do you figure out splits?
[0:52:34] Bowwjack: @Towelliee you see the changes to M+ last night?
[0:52:45] Aertharion: Aertharion subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 48 months! 
[0:52:49] Armdel: no reason not to when most bosses before tindral were fairly quick kills
[0:53:03] frostfire1228: i give tindril 2 hours after the extra gear
[0:53:12] Rudric_Ice: this is why people dont really watch RWF just splits and then reset then splits so boring
[0:53:12] Moobot:  Towelliee.com has all of your Towelliee news WoW UI addon information, and merchandise collection. Check it out!
[0:53:20] Bulgogiprince: They going Dark for Fyrak?
[0:53:27] mavericks312: if im liquid i shut down streams when we get to fyrakk
[0:53:42] Thoreya: people havent done splits in like 3 days what u mean?
[0:53:44] ZeusDNA: @Rudric_Ice The 40k people watching Echo's channel would say otherwise lol
[0:53:45] Thoreya: 3-4 days
[0:53:51] Thewunk: What was the most pulled boss in all of the raids within a Race?
[0:53:54] UzarhFPS: when is reset? :P
[0:53:55] nevercluckyy: i was just happy to sell last night after almost 400 kills they were still in amazing spirits they arent just wiped like they were with halondrus
[0:54:21] raldrik: then blizzard will decide who wins by what time they nerf fyrakk so they can go home for thanksgiving
[0:54:26] Rudric_Ice: @ZeusDNA 40k aint that high it has been the same for years now
[0:54:44] digaboom: I really think they should just lock half the raid in Mythic for the first week if they want to drag it out
[0:54:47] ZeusDNA: @mavericks312 I think it will depend on when they get to Fyrrak, If they get there late in their raiding day, they could stop streaming but keep pulling
[0:55:04] Thoreya: ya thanksgiving is kinda just a 1 day thing
[0:55:08] Thoreya: for lots of peeps
[0:55:09] wEiRdO_dUdE: I think Fyrakk is probably going to be tough and Echo can catch back up again
[0:55:13] ZeusDNA: @Rudric_Ice That's just one channel though lol You throw max's and liquids channel and all of the other raiders in. That's a pretty solid amount of viewership for the RWF
[0:55:18] Rottencoarse: @Towelliee  one of echo's main healers is sick today so he's not playing
[0:55:19] mavericks312: @ZeusDNA at this point if liquid gets to fyrakk you have to 100% shut the stream down
[0:55:21] Anthy1887: just make fyrakk last until mid december towKek
[0:55:51] Bulgogiprince: Christmas or Thanksgiving. I think most Americans would give up thanksgiving
[0:56:05] ZeusDNA: @mavericks312 They might not be able to with being part of Liquid. They can't just get to end boss and shut it down until it's killed.
[0:56:06] UzarhFPS: @Rottencoarse yea lyskanon
[0:56:08] Thoreya: @Bulgogiprince for sure
[0:56:21] Thoreya: zaelia
[0:56:23] digaboom: @Bulgogiprince Christmas is everything
[0:56:25] Thoreya: the goat is sick
[0:56:33] nevercluckyy: i just hope that after tindral being one of the hardest fights mechanically in a long time that fyrrak doesnt just fall over in 100 kills
[0:56:42] 91Niki: Good morning Towelliee and chat towHi
[0:56:48] ZeusDNA: @91Niki Morning Niki!
[0:56:50] patrez46: wich addon show u raider score in dungeon finder

[0:57:23] Vesidian: morning everyone
[0:57:23] ThorH13: Morning  niki
[0:57:38] 91Niki: I think americans forget thanksgiving is only in the US :p

[0:58:00] GameWithDerp: also overseas contractors
[0:58:16] Rudric_Ice: @ZeusDNA that viewership has always been the same it didn't really gain ''new'' viewers  thats what im trying to say
[0:58:21] MOLAR305: i celebrate thanksgiving, and used to work thanksgiving mornings when i was at the hospital, double time pay and still get home for that fatness
[0:58:26] Wulfgrym: some people just get paid more to work on a holiday even if they celebrate.
[0:58:30] ilovethemapdust: I used to bring home $200+ a day in tips on those big holidays.
[0:58:34] mavericks312: if liquid kills tandril today i dont think as viewers we see fyrakk till echo gets to it
[0:58:41] Shrenko: to the vindicar BibleThump
[0:58:42] akia03: whats your renown at?

[1:03:34] Felldoh_: Im totally fine with Blizz tuning the last 3 bosses of a mythic raid to the 1%, they will nerf them down as the season goes on
[1:03:43] N3llee: Think the raiders think are mad that they might be raiding throught thanks giving (at least the na team)
[1:03:49] Thoreya: LUL

[1:07:15] sinlesssinner: less than 100 is piss ez
[1:07:39] brewgamingtv: you see the nerfs and buffs to dungeons?
[1:07:59] Felldoh_: Secret mythic phase gonna shred, hoping for another 300 pull

[1:10:53] Thoreya: a dev evoker? what is that
[1:11:06] xrandomdoodx: is it considered a tuning failure if Fyrakk takes less pulls than Tindral? lol
[1:11:25] ambiotic: Nah Echo is kinda expecting a reset too
[1:11:29] cazhually: do you think its possible?
[1:11:34] brewgamingtv: echo best right now is 31.6%
[1:11:44] mavericks312: and they should go full black out
[1:11:52] ambiotic: wouldn't be shocked if they do more splits, both liquid and echo
[1:11:56] Hypertitan: do they cut the feed if there's a mythic only phase?
[1:12:09] mavericks312: make echo come up with there own strat like last tier
[1:12:27] ambiotic: they did during nzoth
[1:12:32] cazhually: do you think liquid has been playing better than echo thus far?
[1:13:02] Hypertitan: well echo is playing out of their minds this morning with a subbed in healer
[1:13:07] JQ47: Lol watch t swift have a mythic only phase
[1:13:07] marineboi1288: Method is catching up

[1:13:19] wEiRdO_dUdE: Method is up in the mix, too
[1:13:27] ArcaneSyntax: I think the Liquid mental has been great so far, very good vibes
[1:13:51] ambiotic: why do people kill the totems now before getting the rest of the pack, so tilting lol
[1:13:55] captiv8: captiv8 subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 69 months! 
[1:14:34] ambiotic: we used to pull them away from the totems and solo the mob
[1:14:35] ambiotic: yep
[1:14:37] Wulfgrym: i thought, i could be wrong but i could of sworn i saw some strats to kill totems first,
[1:14:59] im_capy: Been nice to see almost 10 guilds all on the same boss now too
[1:15:08] ambiotic: they say that cause you dont have dead damage but the AOE from the mobs seems worse than taking 20 seconds to solo it

[1:17:13] brewgamingtv: that p3 overlap of roots/seeds is rough
[1:17:19] ambiotic: that 3rd phase is no joke, its like 3 seconds between abilities so you have roots seeds and dispels within 3 seconds
[1:17:21] Hypertitan: there's some wicked overlaps in the 3rd phase...which might help with gear...might be able to move some cd's around
[1:17:29] Sniper_Penguin: would they reclear, or just extend though
[1:17:30] PadidinJones: How many pulls did heroic fyrakk take?

[1:36:01] adxx: @WytChapp depends on spec. Some specs you will lose dps by swapping targets too much

[1:37:38] Wulfgrym: GM
[1:37:40] AfKarrStormyOne: Sometimes it depends on graphics settings.  Before I upgraded from my laptop to my tower base, I had to play with my graphics on the lowest settings, and I legit could not see some of the floor graphics and the only indication I was standing in bad stuff was my health going down and maybe the feintest of shimmer on the floor

[1:40:48] adxx: In fairness, Atal WAS really easy. +3'ing it on 16's opposed to the other dungeons without much stress @Towelliee
[1:40:49] valianya: Negative because every other key dead

[1:53:09] valianya: Its a combo of faction lock And limiting total number of servers to choose from

[1:55:47] ohnot___her: Towelliee did you see the fan that took a half court shot at the Lakers game and he tore his fucking achilies? lmfao
[1:55:52] MasqureMan: theyve been working on rumble for 3 years?
[1:55:55] AlphasaurusRexx: @mavericks312 i understand thats a subjective stance though. my pug groups die on that fight every time so. just a matter of repetitions to get it right
[1:56:02] Molvonos: LETS FUCKING GO
[1:56:03] CeruleanStar: LOL :D
[1:56:05] wEiRdO_dUdE: what the
[1:56:05] Snabido: Only knew he shuffled to another unknown project
[1:56:07] DeanoTV: WAT
[1:56:08] BrotherBrent: What’s the affix this week?
[1:56:10] kokochris: dafaw?
[1:56:14] Toon11: vampire class would be nice
[1:56:26] kimmo_gaming: Ravendreth allied race LOL
[1:56:28] CeruleanStar: reverse bullet hell... also known as bullet heaven?
[1:56:38] pruteee: I hope if this is a game mode theyr will be no cap on target
[1:56:41] Snabido: We're going to Revendreth, boys Keepo
[1:56:41] 91Niki: That's so cool!!

[1:57:09] MasqureMan: it's a headline off of one datamine file name
[1:57:16] Merkuriuz: i prefere Holocure Kappa
[1:57:16] Shadow_Phoenix_Gaming: lol nothing it is like 2 dollars
[1:57:19] 350zee350: How long servers down for?
[1:57:21] Molvonos: Not much at all.  Dude basically single-handedly created this game and it only costs like, 3 bucks.
[1:57:23] j_bar111: I wonder if it will be a WQ
[1:57:35] valianya: So like when they added plants vs zombies mini game quests
[1:57:46] TweektheProphet: I wonder if this is testing the waters for their survival game
[1:58:03] AlphasaurusRexx: @j_bar111 i hope its a game mode like the tower or brawlers guild
[1:58:28] AlphasaurusRexx: liquid is starting at 8
[1:58:31] ParfumAmerican: but when the story will get good tho?
[1:58:32] akia03: wasnt that after you kill gyrakk
[1:58:37] AlphasaurusRexx: PST
[1:58:38] Submarine_Mike: getting closer, 31%
[1:58:46] valianya: Their survival game Isn't Vampire Survivor based stop, lol
[1:58:59] Molvonos: Yea, there's one more quest involving Tyr supposedly
[1:59:01] ShinoaKurisu: i know were getting the last Tyr quest
[1:59:04] smiles82: they just did 26% now
[1:59:06] 91Niki: @Molvonos Yep basically a better game with more hours to sink in than 90% of most AAA titles
[1:59:11] Toon11: LUL
[1:59:25] j_bar111: @j_bar111 Thats a good point
[1:59:27] Suligane: Are echo on NA realms now?
[1:59:33] mmmayonez: @Towelliee i dont understand this echo esports im new to wow what are they doing?
[1:59:36] Toon11: I want there to be a secret mythic only boss, just to see the reaction on their faces
[1:59:37] Snabido: Someone got a boss pull sheet? CoolCat
[1:59:42] xrandomdoodx: @Towelliee do you think its possible that Fyrakk takes way less pulls han Tindral?
[1:59:46] kramer_1996: Avatar was like 460 ish
[1:59:55] Molvonos: @91Niki I have 100% of t he achieves and make sure its the first thing I do with every patch that adds more.  I shall become a WoW Vampire Survivor Streamer if it's real.
[2:00:00] 91Niki: I mean, depends, if he has a mythic phase
[2:00:09] szble: LUL
[2:00:16] mavericks312: tandril will go down as the best boss this xpac
[2:00:22] valianya: Survivor game genre Isn't Vampire Survivor.  Its like Subnautica, Green Hell, ARK, Valheim
[2:00:29] Zilimir: this reset of gear is going to be huge for them
[2:00:33] 91Niki: @Molvonos Yeah it's one of the games that I wanna 100% at some point. Amazing game. That and Brotato is probably my favorite of those games
[2:00:39] Tyr7: so Liquid will still be stuck on RWF for Thanksgiving
[2:00:47] wEiRdO_dUdE: Coordinating to soak those seeds without killing the raid is a real challenge
[2:00:49] AlphasaurusRexx: @mmmayonez Echo is a large Esports organization and tehy have a wow guild. they are competing with other guilds like Liquid (another large Esports org) to complete the raid on mythic difficulty first.
[2:01:13] pbnj_kills: can they just stop launching raids around holidays
[2:01:32] mmmayonez: @AlphasaurusRexx  ah like comp speedrun?
[2:01:32] 91Niki: @pbnj_kills It's not holidays for EU LUL

[2:01:42] mavericks312: thanksgiving isnt a holiday worldwide so there is that
[2:01:43] Ispintowin: 2nd wing for LFR comes out today LUL

[2:02:39] YungDizzY: how old is ony?
[2:02:40] akia03: fire wing fun in lfr
[2:02:51] AlphasaurusRexx: @mmmayonez kind of. usually these take somewhere between a week or two to finish and the team that wins gets bragging rights until next raid tier. these guys are simultaneously learning mechanics and perfecting mechanics they know until they get a kill and move onto the next boss
[2:02:57] 91Niki: Basically
[2:02:58] zx_nt: did you see the guy bricked up after smolderon
[2:03:14] omegablue267: what did blizz do buff the 8thg boss?
[2:03:14] xhale2nhale: yea they made the choice to do RWF not Blizzard
[2:03:16] 91Niki: Food is food :p
[2:03:18] theDirtyon3: KEKW
[2:03:23] HaxzorJimDuggan: @doomester that was just for normal clear for the lulz on launch day
[2:03:23] snake_like: KEKW
[2:03:24] theDirtyon3: don t search it on stream
[2:03:25] fullyhollow: omg pelase watch that clip
[2:03:26] Marz311: erect
[2:03:27] chriswrites: dont ask
[2:03:28] theDirtyon3: LOL
[2:03:29] chriswrites: lmao
[2:03:31] chefdejour82: LOL

[2:03:46] Toon11: LUL
[2:03:48] mavericks312: idk something about turkey stuffing mashed and veggies hit diff lol
[2:03:53] haveachub: dude from BDG on stream was aroused after smolderon kill....thats what he means by bricked up lol
[2:04:01] Calphurnious: @cam__ Oh, I thought it was some how referring to like bricking a key
[2:04:01] Toon11: all according to plan
[2:04:20] Toon11: LUL
[2:04:26] lordbelar: I've celebrated thanksgiving with Italians in Italy and Turks in Turkey. (at both their houses)  It is a reason to get together and eat. Most people only need a reason to group up.
[2:04:29] ohnot___her: @haveachub That man was HARD
[2:04:39] valianya: The mythic fights weren't ptr tested , they have to hotfix based on their design intentions for the difficulty for the fight, They're not going to leave a weaker than expected boss as weak and killed too fast
[2:04:41] Moobot:  Check out Towelliee's YouTube channel! You can view the 10.2 Raid Fights Overview | https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLQ47ecb6VwPnA53-5r0iEtP5lEyY0HE2m
[2:04:44] Gloriousbrad: People work on Thanksgiving. Welcome to the real world.   Rather be raiding instead of working that day.
[2:04:52] Blah206: LUL
[2:04:53] AlphasaurusRexx: that whole situation is fixed if they global release
[2:04:55] mmmayonez: @alphasaurusrexx makes perfect sense lol, thanks again man didn't realise wow was so in depth thought it was just a casual mmo lol
[2:04:57] Toon11: lmao
[2:05:05] Tyr7: but all Blizz employees might be on holiday to support RWF in case of issues
[2:05:17] haveachub: @ohnot___her CoolStoryBob
[2:05:35] CeruleanStar: yep with the loot refresh today i expect liquid to be on fyrrak fairly quickly
[2:05:37] xhale2nhale: Might not be as easy as that though
[2:05:38] 91Niki: I am 99% sure that blizzard is working on "merging" eu and na
[2:05:47] TheGiant99: All this trouble for one event seems crazy
[2:05:47] AlphasaurusRexx: @mmmayonez its casual for a lot of people, these guys are the .1% of gamers in wow and play at the highest level
[2:05:49] Putcride: @Towelliee they could alawys go back to gating raid sections
[2:05:51] Clicklesly: Even if the release is at the same time the reset messes it up ^^
[2:05:55] 91Niki: All their "no restriction" talk is pointing to it
[2:06:03] j_bar111: Pull counts
[2:06:04] Dark_Kornax: @Towelliee I think people think this is much bigger than it is... i don't think it gets nearly the attention people think it does.
[2:06:04] Snabido: Pulls of all previous bosses
[2:06:08] Cheapshoty0uth: What time is server maintenance til?
[2:06:08] roeddogg: Global raid release AND global maintenance schedule would be great.
[2:06:11] Maydie6066: @91Niki eww gross keep your EU outta me NA
[2:06:16] Shrenko: WAYTOODANK
[2:06:19] Zilimir: It's not even a blizz event, it's community driven, so I say fuck 'em lol
[2:06:21] Snabido: Throwback to Cenarius into Xavius tho
[2:06:27] AlphasaurusRexx: lmfao halondrus, the destroyer of souls
[2:06:27] Toon11: lmao
[2:06:35] 91Niki: @Maydie6066 ijpNO I want my druid challenge mode transmog back
[2:06:50] j_bar111: EN KEKW
[2:06:59] Maydie6066: @91Niki oh well why didn't you say it was for the druids, go on then
[2:07:21] Milenkan: UU'nat or w/e was a beast in crucible
[2:07:23] Elff11: Not Crucible, just Uunat LUL
[2:07:29] TheGiant99: Then in 2 weeks non of it will matter
[2:07:42] j_bar111: EN KEKW 20 pulls
[2:08:00] Heyhowsitgoingtonight: Kj was long
[2:08:04] Marz311: be dissapointing if fyrakk goes down in 50 pulls.
[2:08:06] Eviltuna13: I just think it’s funny that mythic bosses are over tuned just for the race and once it’s over they nerf the bosses so others can clear it
[2:08:40] ambiotic: Should have been Nyume, was really sad it died so fast

[2:10:03] IronWishfull: @Cheapshoty0uth its a 2 hour maint
[2:10:08] Zilimir: @Cheapshoty0uth 7 to 9 PST
[2:10:14] IronWishfull: 14 minutes in
[2:10:15] Tyr7: then blizz will have to spend a lot of $$$ on testing
[2:10:15] Vashile: I think it would be better
[2:10:20] Cheapshoty0uth: Thanks!
[2:10:23] mavericks312: there would still be 0% going in blind
[2:10:29] lucidcream0: leaked LUL
[2:10:32] evercl3armkii: too much cash involved
[2:10:39] Mr_Pennywise_: D:
[2:10:42] TheGiant99: I agree
[2:10:47] mavericks312: it would then just become who do you know who can give you the mechancis
[2:10:56] Hypertitan: at the end of the day RWF is for "entertainment" everything being secret would be kinda cool for the viewer tho.
[2:11:01] Affiiance: How do you feel about the Mythic + difficulty this season?
[2:11:13] Eviltuna13: Just more drama towTnn
[2:11:29] wEiRdO_dUdE: Yep encrypt the journal
[2:11:29] anamroth: Kush hate this boss :D
[2:11:32] Loldarian: Morning
[2:11:39] 91Niki: Imaginary drums?
[2:11:39] tharieon: It's hard already why even do that lpl
[2:11:40] Hypertitan: kush basically lays down in that damn chair alot haha
[2:11:43] fistofnature: @Affiiance its been a week, too early to tell
[2:11:44] snake_like: tweaking after 400 attempts
[2:11:44] oradros: edible just kick in
[2:11:48] ambiotic: speaking of kush let me get wesley pipes
[2:11:55] 91Niki: KEKW
[2:11:56] smashwow: idk still better than the dude that was rock hard after killing smoldy Kappa
[2:11:58] Solkos: Eliminate the addons that assist you and it would be a totally different game.   I am curious how hard raids can get without these addons.
[2:11:59] Snabido: wtf LUL
[2:12:06] Cheapshoty0uth: If they just added 1 sec to the seeds exploding Tindral would be dead
[2:12:10] valianya: Its like the Hogwarts Tri Wizard Challenge, everyone participating  spied or was told what the challenges were ahead of time
[2:12:11] Mr_Pennywise_: towTnn
[2:12:17] Affiiance: @fistofnature not really. Could easily have done all of them by now
[2:12:20] Squintymonk31: solid idea honestly
[2:12:25] Snabido: On mythic or heroic?
[2:12:27] Tripl3dot: thatd be cool
[2:12:36] TopBoyInnit: Idk if that would work ppl would just google the journal at that point
[2:12:37] zx_nt: it would just be data mined though which sucks
[2:13:02] ParfumAmerican: So if this is a Esport Competition why are they not tested for drugs LUL That can give a big lead
[2:13:07] valianya: LFR disasters without journal  lol
[2:13:08] 91Niki: Yeah but that is evolving the raids around world first raids. I don't think that is in Blizzards interest
[2:13:09] Hypertitan: blizzard can encrypt shit...they've encrypted alot of things in the past
[2:13:19] Tripl3dot: IT'd be tough to figure out tuning/bugs with less testing
[2:13:25] evercl3armkii: lol
[2:13:26] Tyr7: lol
[2:13:27] beefy_cheez: no shot lmao
[2:13:27] Squintymonk31: LUL
[2:13:32] j_bar111: LFR players would be very mad if they could read KEKW
[2:13:32] Effin_Steffin: What Journal?
[2:13:33] pbnj_kills: i know the mechanics and still dont do them on lfr
[2:13:34] keterych: Me do dps SMOrc
[2:13:34] Maydie6066: @Towelliee they do, for the loot page Kappa
[2:13:35] xrandomdoodx: lmao stand in fire all day
[2:13:35] Gunther_TheGoat: We just send it
[2:13:38] Hypertitan: brother...lfr players don't even know dungeon journal's exist haha
[2:13:39] Daveybutter: Daveybutter subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 95 months! 
[2:13:39] chefdejour82: I just go in
[2:13:42] mavericks312: lfr players huff markers and just go balls to the wall in LFR
[2:13:42] Phil87z: To be fair I don’t read th journal. I usually just watch a hazel guide
[2:13:43] PrillaGorilla: What journal?
[2:13:45] Bulgogiprince: What's the journal
[2:13:46] Calphurnious: LFR should just be an auto battler
[2:13:49] src1923: lfr players dont know how  to read
[2:13:49] snake_like: true lfr players don't even look at their screen moon2GIGA
[2:13:50] TweektheProphet: LOL LFR doing mechanics would be an improvement
[2:13:56] Arore_1599: LFR... like I never seen the fights before... queued... 20 mins later 3 dead bosses all one shot
[2:13:58] Khooya_: lmao journal, you can be thankful if they read the bossname before
[2:13:59] xxCameleon77xx: they have a journal for this game?
[2:14:00] Morpserie: @radudk KEKW
[2:14:02] TheGiant99: But yetv
[2:14:03] wizziFlu: What is this yornal you speak of?
[2:14:03] chaosjoshua: determination buff till we beat it
[2:14:03] oradros: LFR people tanking the boss in the middle
[2:14:08] beefy_cheez: that actually would be sick
[2:14:09] xrandomdoodx: that's actually a good idea
[2:14:14] Eggz1004: i only open the journal in LFR to look at all the loot im not gonna win lol
[2:14:15] Ispintowin: i just go in and i do what DBM tells what to do KEKW
[2:14:15] cabalish: i want that too
[2:14:16] Heyhowsitgoingtonight: Towelliee stop it
[2:14:17] TheGiant99: But yet lfr is the most run raid by alot
[2:14:27] ambiotic: Hunter and rogues
[2:14:31] pbnj_kills: new priest
[2:14:34] Solkos: They had their disc priest got sick
[2:14:34] Heyhowsitgoingtonight: You know they already told you that's coming at some point
[2:14:35] TweektheProphet: a rogue and hunter
[2:14:38] Yngvezs: Sol the new healer
[2:14:38] cabalish: they needed daggers
[2:14:40] Solkos: so they have a holy instead
[2:14:42] Fullmetal491: priest
[2:14:46] valianya: They might do that if tank or healer shortage for LFR
[2:14:46] evercl3armkii: yeah cause their rogues were running sub for the extra aoe
[2:14:50] price1414: new healer
[2:14:55] ZarisHeal: that must activated for old raids too.
[2:14:56] Fullmetal491: their disc priest is sic
[2:14:57] Maruika: echo looking great this race
[2:14:59] Fullmetal491: sic
[2:15:03] beefy_cheez: dude remember when you couldn't be a fire mage vs a'lar?
[2:15:14] MasqureMan: blizzard would be better off banning people than redoing server structure

[2:20:31] Hypertitan: i think that's where it's gonna end tho...unless they can bring back denathrius...cuz he was was one of the few characters people liked in SL
[2:20:31] Sylore: @zender4k what sword
[2:20:40] Nerendis: Method spending less than 20 minutes between fights would be a sign of the apocalypse
[2:20:50] AlphasaurusRexx: @Sharkeys shit did we lose her again? i skipped all cutscenes lol
[2:21:03] snake_like: the trailer is ambiguous enough you can just say Anduin regrets buying an NFT and asked Thrall for a loan he can't pay back
[2:21:04] Loldarian: Im new, does your hammer mean something or is it just a rad symbol?
[2:21:04] kimmo_gaming: Someone will free him from the sword 100%

[2:22:22] wEiRdO_dUdE: If there is a last titan, that means the rest of them get snuffed
[2:22:23] ArcaneSyntax: @towelliee maybe the paladin titan will come back
[2:22:28] NVbrutal: last titan is sargeras.
[2:22:40] CoolioDoom: Titans return in the last Titan so they cannot die in Midnight, I'd say they die in the last Titan.
[2:23:04] Crowargus: sargeras has turned illidan n illdan has taken out all the titans only sargeras left the last titan
[2:23:05] gimmlay: Titans die in the war within
[2:23:07] MasqureMan: i hope they bring azshara back for midnight. she shouldve been a bigger boss
[2:23:14] CoolioDoom: Oh did not think about that.
[2:23:19] mlewis4011: Chris said the titans aren't coming back till Last Titan
[2:23:21] LancerVI: Azeroth becomes the last titan because all the other titans get offed
[2:23:22] Bloodhaven08: It could be the last titian created
[2:23:24] Nerendis: Yeah "last" doesn't not mean "sole" it just means the end of a line.
[2:23:24] Wulfgrym: sagaras vs the void
[2:23:26] AlphasaurusRexx: "Remember the Titans" - a WoW journy
[2:23:30] Hypertitan: the aspects basically said in that last cutscene that azeroth isn't a titan
[2:23:31] valianya: Anduin lost his dad, then had to fight those he'd allied with against the Legion, then watched his people die in Lordaeron and had a midlife crisis on the battlefield when putting down sword to bubble rez.  Man's got more reasons for PTSD than just Jailer's nipple Domination
[2:23:36] Hypertitan: it wasn't "titan magic"
[2:23:38] dinadreth_: Chris said the titans return to ulduar in the last titan no?
[2:23:48] papaherc: The last titan is leeroy Jenkins...
[2:23:48] gimmlay: Last titan is hogger
[2:23:55] cipusanx: didn't chris told a short story for each expansion and the last titan will be with the titans? midnight is baout the void and so on

[2:52:57] mavericks312: after the what blizz did to fuck up the razegath race they wont touch it
[2:52:57] macmittens808: i hope liquid kills it after reset then echo right after them but before their reset for maximum drama KEKW
[2:52:59] Zolshy89: they wont nerf it

[2:54:52] Kinghorn: tindral dies before thursday 100%, fyrakk probably not
[2:54:54] Fangy_Playz: The entire raid that is
[2:54:59] j_hooligan: they are gonna blow thru a reclear and get geared out the wazz-u
[2:55:13] shalomski: Only nerf I could see is seeds being 5 secs instead of 3 in p2
[2:55:18] Screamnsteam: they wont kill tindril, theyre like 30% off lol
[2:55:35] ambiotic: And even if Echo kills this its not the end of the world for liquid cause they will still be ahead in gear
[2:55:42] Strifelol: 2 sparks being used is going to be huge too
[2:55:48] jilech: its 5 pm eu
[2:55:49] c0mmander_starscream: If Liquid has time for hookers and blow, they have time for splits LUL
[2:55:58] Rottencoarse: @Towelliee  4 hours they're going to bed early tonite for the 5 am reset for tomorrow
[2:56:01] Fangy_Playz: Do you think the raid gets cleared before Turkey day towel?
[2:56:09] HopeThePriest: I dont think they nerf it again based on teh fact that huge upgrades are about to hit
[2:56:14] lazygamer9708: Crafted gear?
[2:56:15] Niksen_99: its so annoying with the time difference
[2:56:15] HopeThePriest: Thats enough of a nerf
[2:56:20] nevercluckyy: im still holding out hope that at 10-15% tindral has a mythic only platform
[2:56:24] jilech: they will stop early tho, reset is 5 am eu
[2:56:29] AlphasaurusRexx: @Fangy_Playz not unless blizzard intervenes

[2:57:35] Redpandalol: they are gonna off stream till like 50%
[2:57:43] 91Niki: @j_hooligan Server list being up says nothing about how quickly they will be live

[3:10:58] Zeronic54: Bungie laid them off though, it had nothing to do with sony telling them too
[3:11:02] Zeronic54: as per some reports
[3:11:03] Scorpio1401: @LordFaunty is that what that rancid smelling thing is that people have challenges for?

[3:11:29] Akermay: According to people inside Bungie, Sony actually prevented a lot of layoffs. Would have been worse without them
[3:11:52] Scarhearth: the bungie layoffs made me uninstall destiny 2. the fact they let Michael Salvatori go destroyed any way to play D2. No banger music from him = no go for me

[3:12:16] snake_like: jk

[3:12:48] bgriff87: @Scarhearth Bungie laying off composers... its their thing

[3:13:20] ambiotic: Then the community team gets nominated and they were all fired so the producers were going to accept it and they just laid off the team
[3:13:25] c0mmander_starscream: that happens a lot, layoffs before the new tax year

[6:35:21] Molvonos: @MixAndFlix You havent been around for a minute have you?
[6:35:31] 91Niki: Blizzard really needs to give AUG evokers a support icon rather than a dps icon LUL
[6:35:39] Molvonos: Augvoker's support their group, rather than doing pure, raw damage.
[6:35:48] 91Niki: The amount of reddit posts of people getting kicked for low dps as AUG evokers are crazy
[6:36:00] Molvonos: Generally increasing the pure DPS in the group's overall by a cool 20-30k minimum.

[6:36:20] Moobot:  Towelliee.com has all of your Towelliee news WoW UI addon information, and merchandise collection. Check it out!

[6:37:19] tyreeas: liquid
[6:37:29] Molvonos: Augs are stronger in M+ because of their passives, but if you have multiple in raid, they're really good there too.
