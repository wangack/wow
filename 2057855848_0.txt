[0:05:50] kaylagrayla: hello!
[0:05:53] medvet03: Good morning Hazel! Good morning everyone! Happy Friday!
[0:05:55] Ryok: i finally got the sire denathrius pet yagaH and i somehow got another korkron juggernaut while farming the tusks of mannoroth xD
[0:06:05] Ujai321: she could be Wigra
[0:06:11] Zuldak: Ai deep fake patterns on Kira's fur :p
[0:06:33] Ryok: oh i also finally got the drake armor yagaH
[0:06:36] medvet03: @Ryok Congratz!
[0:06:58] zannuss: Howdy Hazel, finally got that silly pink rocket mount after 14 years of farming
[0:07:01] Ryok: yes it's gonna stay on my warrior forever, just like i have a spawn of horridon in my main's bank xD
[0:07:03] seamuscg: i see a face in ur cats fur lol
[0:07:22] Zuldak: G....grats
[0:07:39] Ryok: @medvet03 thanks ^^
[0:07:50] zannuss: All mount are obtainable with enough persistence
[0:08:12] accio_coffee: Congrats! I have yet to see that mount after 10 years ðŸ˜”
[0:08:22] Ryok: @zannuss except those that literally aren't available anymore :P
[0:08:39] wolfcloudchaser80: Except old AOTC type mounts...
[0:08:46] zannuss: Ok those don't count
[0:08:58] Zuldak: Has boy made any progress with the class hall?
[0:09:06] anker_jym: Hazel, do you have the Headless Horseman mount? That's really the only holiday mount I care about getting.
[0:09:32] Zuldak: Hot take, soft noodles are better than al dente
[0:09:54] fooglefish: can druid forms use dragonriding now? is it toggleable on/off?
[0:10:00] zannuss: Soft noodles are fine, not mushy
[0:10:07] Ujai321: i cook my noodles until they disintegrate and become just starchy water
[0:10:25] Hippwn: I just don't see the point in making a holiday mount so rare it just feels miserable if you are unlucky
[0:10:30] cashthb: howdy?
[0:10:51] mihoru_master: hoi how is it going?
[0:11:08] jeffdmk: you have to win a solo shuffle to let us hear music
[0:11:12] morti_garcia: hey haven't been here in a hot minute, you haven't played sod?
[0:11:26] Zuldak: Someone had the idea of making the mount obtainable for 1000 tokens. It puts a timer that after a few years of trying you will get it
[0:11:33] Ujai321: she has played SoD
[0:11:41] Ujai321: not for very long, but she has
[0:11:51] zannuss: I'm slacking on token grind with alts for this event
[0:12:21] jeffdmk: As someone that does not have it stop making things easier
[0:12:23] Hippwn: On another note you really got me addicted to arena I got my 2nd character to 1800
[0:12:30] Ujai321: i like to win my mounts in a slot machine, not work to eventually pay it off
[0:12:35] forebringer: also don't the love is in the air tokens disappear after the holiday ends?
[0:12:35] accio_coffee: I'm really enjoying the new love is in the air event. I'm glad Blizz finally re designing the holiday events.
[0:13:09] wolfcloudchaser80: Druid roots also are nice on that guy
[0:13:14] mihoru_master: hi from canada how are ya hazel?
[0:14:08] anker_jym: What is your favorite WoW holiday?
[0:14:09] mihoru_master: it pretty cold
[0:14:13] mihoru_master: snow still there
[0:14:36] zannuss: hallows end cause I can troll people with wands
[0:14:44] seamuscg: does the achievement youre tracking give a reward
[0:14:56] wolfcloudchaser80: I'm kinda fond of Hallow's End, theming-wise
[0:14:59] Ujai321: you do get to drunkenly ride a ram at brewfest, so that is hard to beat
[0:15:12] zannuss: I still have like 10 wands in my bag for randomly turning friends into a slime
[0:15:13] Ryok: @anker_jym the holiday of reset day every wednesday xDF
[0:15:17] Ryok: xD*
[0:15:21] anker_jym: Halloween is my favorite irl, so Hallow's End for me
[0:15:26] mihoru_master: are you playing in NA or EU atm?
[0:15:32] Woodled: is this a new quest?
[0:15:40] mihoru_master: even tho im in canada i play in EU
[0:15:42] Hippwn: I wish winter veil was longer because I go far to visit family and I can't do much of the winter veil stuff every year
[0:15:54] Ujai321: seems like love is really high in the air here
[0:15:56] JasperCalico: I found them closer to the ground
[0:16:02] heldtheline: the winter veil music is so soothing
[0:17:02] wolfcloudchaser80: When it spawns, I swear it puts away my camera
[0:17:05] saga_no: Juuhuu
[0:17:08] rivellana: wow, crowded server
[0:17:10] cashthb: it's whiter than the regular ones
[0:17:36] seamuscg: hes albino
[0:18:00] heldtheline: I really like that they give portals for this; it's really player-friendly
[0:18:11] anker_jym: Man, I can't wait until Druids get dynamic flying. It feels so wrong to use an actual mount on a Druid lol
[0:18:12] Ujai321: you played Hades, right?
[0:18:14] jeffdmk: you can skip your days off and have enough tokens
[0:18:34] cashthb: it's like 10 seconds away from shatrath
[0:18:47] Ujai321: i got it yesterday on sale. havent started it, tho
[0:18:58] JasperCalico: the goldshire quest is scary on moon guard exemLUL
[0:19:27] Ujai321: i'm gonna play it on my steam deck, so... upgraded switch, by quite a bit
[0:19:45] Ujai321: i'm not. i have a switch as well
[0:19:56] Ujai321: but man, the deck feels just so much better in my hands
[0:20:05] saga_no: I'm secretly hoping BG3 will be ported to Switch sometime in the future - though I doubt it will.... but it'd be *nice* if it did
[0:20:08] erinnightz: hazelWave hazelLurk
[0:20:09] wolfcloudchaser80: I peeked into Moonguard Goldshire to see what all the talk was about. You don't actually hear/see anything other than tons of stationary players.
[0:20:21] cashthb: switch is pretty lacking even software-wise if that makes you feel any better
[0:20:39] seamuscg: joel monkaS
[0:20:41] sk8rbunn: I like my steam deck
[0:20:44] saga_no: @joelb95m Chill - OK?
[0:20:50] cashthb: @saga_no os2 came out for Ipads I think, and it's on the same engine
[0:21:05] Jonboy4556: the first gen steam deck is nice just lacks battery life and heat is also an issue
[0:21:11] cashthb: it's handheld
[0:21:13] saga_no: @cashthb my iPad is too old for the newest OS ...so... yeh.
[0:21:15] Ujai321: my steam games in a switch form factor
[0:21:19] sk8rbunn: same draw a switch, I can lay in bed and play elden ring
[0:21:28] seamuscg: sitting on my bed and gaming is so much nicer
[0:21:35] Ujai321: or really, ANY games, but steam is the selling point
[0:21:59] Ujai321: you could play WoW on a deck
[0:22:01] Ujai321: in bed
[0:22:04] Jonboy4556: steam deck is great option for portable pc games
[0:22:04] heldtheline: yeah, for chronic illness peeps, handhelds are lifesavers sometimes
[0:22:22] saga_no: @heldtheline This. My Switch has saved my sanity more than once...
[0:22:22] NordicSorcerer: @saga_no Alas that can't happen. Larian was interviewed about it, and the Nintendo license is explicitly incompatible with the license of several of the development libraries used for the BG3 engine (among other things the weighted random number generator used for the dice-toss).
[0:22:28] dinnopizza: Do you like SoD?
[0:22:32] Ujai321: there is a controller mod for WoW. but yeah, it's a process
[0:22:34] cashthb: @saga_no i meant the computation power is there
[0:22:37] sk8rbunn: with console port, wow isnt bad. I prolly wouldnt push keys or anything like that, but for running old raids for mounts, its nice
[0:22:41] saga_no: @NordicSorcerer I figured - but a girl can dream
[0:22:56] Streamlabs: joelb95m -> all links are devoured at once.
[0:23:19] JasperCalico: after you learn to play with controller you can do all end game content including mythic rating and high keys, just takes practice to relearn the motions FeelsOkayMan
[0:24:00] Streamlabs: joelb95m -> all links are devoured at once.
[0:24:08] NordicSorcerer: @saga_no Oh, I agree, but Nintendo worded their SDK license in a way that explicitly prohibits the use of development libraries under the CDDL opensource license.
[0:24:09] cashthb: thinking of it, nintendo prolly wouldn't be to hot on bgs "weird" stuff either
[0:24:09] saga_no: Heh.
[0:24:36] jgbrit: Hey Hazel, how's your morning hazelLove
[0:24:41] Ujai321: dont tell anyone, but what got me to finally buy one was to have an all in one machine for current games and emulation, that i could just take with me and play whereever i want. plus, as i said, it feels real nice to hold and has a pretty good OLED screen, PLUS it is just a PC (with linux, but you can put windows on it if you want)
[0:25:10] saga_no: @Ujai321 What Linux kernel does it run?
[0:25:13] heldtheline: I love how gnomes put their whole bodies into this
[0:25:51] NordicSorcerer: @cashthb That is actually less of a problem. The Skyrim port has access to all the "in-game-mods" in Bethesda's own "shop", for instance. According to Larian, the only problem is a license one.
[0:26:02] wolfcloudchaser80: I attempted an emulator on my PC, and... well, TotK ran so sketchy. Guess I need something other than a Steam Controller, too.
[0:26:12] cashthb: @saga_no you prolly meant distro, valve has it's own one
[0:26:17] Ujai321: @saga_no couldnt tell you, i'm very much a linux noob. it is called SteamOS, if you want to check it out
[0:26:43] saga_no: @cashthb I ...meant Kernel........ was curious. I assumed the distro would be a Steam/Valve proprietary one. But thanks.
[0:26:46] Ujai321: not just away from home. away from my desk
[0:27:02] NordicSorcerer: IIRC, SteamOS is based on a Debian fork?
[0:27:08] saga_no: @Ujai321 Aight - thanks :)
[0:27:39] MajorFrog225: why does everyone but me have the fyrakk mount
[0:27:48] jgbrit: I just saw the Freehold mount, it's a sign, today is the day!
[0:28:04] Zuldak: There are some super weird 'dating' Sims on steam
[0:28:08] saga_no: @NordicSorcerer "Draws from Debian 8" apparently
[0:28:11] Zuldak: As hazels library shows
[0:28:12] MajorFrog225: the dragonriding skin haha
[0:28:14] saga_no: So it should be fairly stable
[0:28:26] MajorFrog225: saw the whole group mount up on it on the way from tindral to fyrakk
[0:29:11] MajorFrog225: im sorry what? its been in my bags for weeks then wtf
[0:29:14] NordicSorcerer: I still prefer BSD over SysV unices (so FreeBSD, Solaris and Irix rather than Linux or SCO). ;)
[0:29:18] brooklynitetv: What's that drop rate? I've never seen that drop
[0:29:36] cashthb: the debian one is pretty much as stable as it gets
[0:29:40] MajorFrog225: yea probably just learned it and forgot
[0:29:46] saga_no: "Updated kernel tracking the 4.1 longterm branch" with Debian 8-esque distro should be pretty decent for a handheld the size of a Switch OLED
[0:29:49] sk8rbunn: hazel, thoughts on running low rise for the quantum coarser, vs targeting dungees?
[0:29:53] saga_no: Now I know. haha
[0:29:58] Hulkhokie: I've never done an AOTC :(
[0:30:05] saga_no: Haven't touched Linux since I were 17 - but hey........ fun
[0:30:19] zannuss: That's how I got mine lol
[0:30:36] Ujai321: poor elephant
[0:31:07] sk8rbunn: simply be a WW monk that can damn near solo a +2
[0:31:18] Zuldak: I bet there are geared people in chat who would be happy to help if you wanted
[0:31:48] MajorFrog225: +2 is easy though.  everyone i did it with including myself was around 440 and we +++ it and bosses were like 40 seconds
[0:31:54] Ujai321: because it's cheating.
[0:32:03] Zuldak: That's fine, it's your choice
[0:32:05] NordicSorcerer: I silently sneak out the back when someone mentions people being annoyed by flash photography... :P
[0:32:13] sanguinette: Just soloed Plaguefall for the secret mount. That was pretty funny.
[0:32:15] sk8rbunn: in a funny twist, I think sharkbait is the last mount I can get from the coarser
[0:32:31] saga_no: @NordicSorcerer You're not in the habit of shoving a flash in an elephant's face, tho... LUL
[0:33:01] NordicSorcerer: @saga_no That's due to a lack of accessible elephants, dearest. ;)
[0:33:12] saga_no: I didn't compliment the hair today - it's cute!
[0:33:27] saga_no: And not as warm, I'd imagine?
[0:33:38] saga_no: (I'm assuming they are all synthetic fibre wigs here)
[0:33:48] Ujai321: how heavy are the heavier ones? is it actually tiresome to wear?
[0:33:59] saga_no: Cuz human hair is ... *EXPENSIVE*
[0:34:24] Ujai321: and yet, you have the biggest sun hat ...
[0:34:42] Ujai321: on the other hand, the sun also makes headaches, so whatever
[0:34:52] heldtheline: I used to get headaches from having long hair, never again
[0:35:01] saga_no: I have a few friends with Alopecia and they have like one or two human hair wigs for "fancy" use and a bunch of fun synthetic ones
[0:35:23] NordicSorcerer: @HazelNuttyGames It can be a nerve pressure point so a hair-net under the wig can be the cause of the problem. If so, it can be "solved" by adding a (microscopic) padding on each side of the pressure point.
[0:35:32] Ujai321: short hair just seems like the best option for you
[0:36:01] Ujai321: just embrace the dumbness
[0:36:04] saga_no: I'd say "embrace the dumb" - but ... yaknow
[0:36:16] anker_jym: We won't judge lol
[0:36:26] Ujai321: WHAT1áºž
[0:36:28] darkangelkces: darkangelkces subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 2 months! 
[0:36:28] Streamlabs: darkangelkces just subscribed with Twitch Prime!
[0:36:34] NordicSorcerer: @HazelNuttyGames A (good) friend of @saga_no and be has that exact problem (and alopecia), and ... because of her hobby also needs wigs that are EXTREMELY snug fitting, so she spent some time finding the solution. ;)
[0:36:41] Zuldak: I mean you can exercise with no clothes if you're alone and in private
[0:36:53] wolfcloudchaser80: Man, Twitch is in a new Bot Era. They're persistent these days.
[0:37:25] McScooterson: @wolfcloudchaser80 they've been busy again for sure
[0:37:33] heldtheline: that's not dumb; from a young age, we're conditioned to the idea that there are clothes just for exercising (gym clothes, etc)
[0:37:34] aerohokie: aerohokie subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 36 months! 3 years?! time flies
[0:37:34] Streamlabs: aerohokie just subscribed with Tier 1!
[0:37:41] L3fis: What are you grinding
[0:38:15] saga_no: Compression Leggings - modern day girdles
[0:38:33] saga_no: They look nice - but... maaan.......... getting into those things sometimes is a *struggle*
[0:38:35] sk8rbunn: playing drums is the best exercies
[0:38:37] McScooterson: I'd wager girdles are still girdles but sure
[0:38:53] cashthb: not an expert, but it sounds like they should be pretty tight
[0:39:16] NordicSorcerer: @HazelNuttyGames You should check out the "grip leggings" made for aerial-sports (their inner lining uses nanotubes to move moisture away from the skin so you don't get itchy, nor do you "loose grip" when climbing, etc.
[0:39:17] Ujai321: this toy really has some rapture vibes
[0:39:18] saga_no: @McScooterson True - just less common than compression tights in the general population
[0:39:47] seamuscg: the mounts have become independent
[0:39:59] cashthb: :O
[0:40:02] Ujai321: ...yup, that tracks
[0:40:32] saga_no: Grippy leggings are really nice - ...they are *grippy* though, so keep that in mind (they are coated with something that lets you grip onto the pole)
[0:40:44] Ujai321: how many knitted sweaters do you have?
[0:41:02] NordicSorcerer: I haven't used them myself (exposing me in leggings for the world would be counted as a crime against humanity, I truly belong on the viewfinder side of the camera), but I do hear things from those I photograph. ;)
[0:41:05] Ujai321: oh, you made it sound like 12
[0:41:08] 7thSaga: nyannBuff1 hazelOmg nyannBuff2  Hello Hazel and Chat!
[0:41:08] McScooterson: speaking of, we haven't seen the seester pink sweater in a while
[0:41:26] SaraDivine: i remember in high school the wrestlers would do laps in the gym in layers of sweats and spit in a garbage can on each lap to drop for weigh ins. that's what i always think of with sweats now lol.
[0:41:42] wolfcloudchaser80: "Grippy leggings" almost sounds like some RPG equipment with special abilities.
[0:41:48] cashthb: if it's not food why can he eat it?
[0:42:13] saga_no: Imma pop out now - best of vibes for the mount!
[0:42:22] 7thSaga: LUL
[0:42:23] Ujai321: you had no eyes for it?
[0:42:27] 7thSaga: ''i Like Food''
[0:43:05] NordicSorcerer: @wolfcloudchaser80 Close. It's tri-layer leggings (inner layer is for removing sweat so they grip the legs, mid layer is for integrity, outer layer is "gecko grip" to give the same grip against solid surfaces as natural skin does)
[0:43:18] anker_jym: I thought I heard somewhere that bread was actually bad for ducks?
[0:43:19] NordicSorcerer: I'm gonna join my wife in dropping out. Bbl. :)
[0:43:19] brooklynitetv: Brb unhanging and folding all my knit tops
[0:43:28] Ujai321: pets really are like their owners

[0:43:46] sparklifegaming: true
[0:43:59] wolfcloudchaser80: @NordicSorcerer Aww, there went my dream of rocking a Grippy Leggings Barbarian build!
[0:44:02] Ujai321: you know what does my head in a bit? pizza is just bread.
[0:44:18] Elrathir: Aaaaany parrots?
[0:44:18] naany213: naany213 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 56 months, currently on a 56 month streak! O boy time just runs by so fast. Thanks for all the cozy content and good luck on your mount farm
[0:44:19] Streamlabs: naany213 just subscribed with Tier 1!
[0:44:54] Ujai321: 12 knit sweaters, but one pair of socks...
[0:45:05] 7thSaga: 7thSaga watched 3 consecutive streams this month and sparked a watch streak! im a regular here :)
[0:45:24] anker_jym: Discuss religion and politics while killing Harlan, mount drop will be guaranteed lol
[0:45:37] MajorFrog225: Are those unused boosts?
[0:46:01] Ujai321: @MajorFrog225 yes. the king might need them
[0:46:05] SaraDivine: i've been seeing some recipes for sourdough pizza crust. haven't decided if i want to try it yet
[0:46:14] MajorFrog225: Dang i hate leveling lol
[0:46:17] heldtheline: boosts are a bit weird; you get all these abilities and no idea how to use them
[0:46:19] tonibeeswax: Wow this looks awesome
[0:46:27] tonibeeswax: Where is this?
[0:46:40] tonibeeswax: ooooh
[0:46:40] omgGaara: Your streams help me sleep every night, thanks for all you do
[0:46:48] Hulkhokie: did you name your starter?  ours is "Doughy Tribiani"
[0:46:49] Ujai321: but really, BfA looks awesome all around
[0:47:03] Ujai321: except the horde capital
[0:47:18] Ujai321: @Hulkhokie excellent
[0:47:45] Zuldak: Have you played with soar at all on your old one time main?
[0:47:52] heldtheline: Boralus is neat; I just found a shop called Barrel & Crate the other day
[0:48:46] Ujai321: "making phone calls i dont want to make" so, phone calls
[0:48:51] Zuldak: Are you done with whatever phone calls were plaguing you?
[0:49:11] anker_jym: Boralus is seriously one of the best capital cities. I distinctly remember getting there on BfA launch day, and not starting quests for about two hours because I just explored the city
[0:49:14] necr0me0wcer: i love to do that in suramar. just sitting on a boat and enjoy the view
[0:49:31] cashthb: the old hard cartoony stuff is way better, gimme them crooked chimeys and loud colors
[0:49:51] Zuldak: I didn't realize there were multiple eras of plaguing phone calls. Well hopefully your in a better spot now
[0:49:55] Ujai321: really, stormwind and boralus are excellent cities
[0:50:42] SaraDivine: similar kind of scene in honey i shrunk the kids
[0:50:55] Ujai321: you havent seen the Wallace and Grommit morning routine, have you
[0:51:07] Ujai321: you would like that
[0:51:15] McScooterson: wallace and grommit and peewee's morning routine are top tier
[0:51:25] Zuldak: Well I am glad the construct known as twitch chat is better than a phone call
[0:51:35] McScooterson: wallace and grommit are shorts and movies
[0:51:45] Ujai321: wallace and grommit is a series of movies. but what i am referring to is a scene in one movie
[0:51:53] Zuldak: @mcscooterson cowboy Curtis is such an underrated character
[0:52:06] cashthb: maybe 'cause we don't exist
[0:52:18] wolfcloudchaser80: Because we aren't real! Twitch is bots only. My programming is a little suspect, though
[0:52:31] Ujai321: wallace is a man, and grommit is a dog. in that particular movie, a criminal penguin weasels his way into their home and tries to replace grommit
[0:52:37] McScooterson: But if you go watch The Wrong Trousers, you'll get the full morning it
[0:52:53] tylur12: Do any pet grinds lately Hazel?
[0:52:57] Zuldak: It's such a trip to see such a classically trained actor like Laurence Fishburn on peewee
[0:53:03] louyouknow: namaste
[0:53:11] Hulkhokie: The Wrong Trousers is amazing
[0:53:14] McScooterson: Also, you'll finally understand when someone goes "Cheeeeese Grommit"
[0:53:16] heldtheline: the zapthrottle ones?
[0:54:03] McScooterson: Any time someone puts the call out for doing keys, I utter a keeeeeys grommit
[0:54:07] sk8rbunn: I 'member the hazel strats
[0:54:14] sk8rbunn: back before xu-fus
[0:54:15] Zuldak: Herbie the love bug... anyone remember those movies? About the Volkswagen beetle car?
[0:54:18] jgbrit: I'm STILL grinding the stupid Porcupette. 12 attempts per day. It's 15k on the AH. I will not give up
[0:54:43] McScooterson: @Zuldak but which one
[0:54:50] Hulkhokie: The only pets I have left are all either HUGE grinds or random drops (or expensive on AH)
[0:55:13] cashthb: ikky types beat everything
[0:55:21] sk8rbunn: rest in peace, howlbomb strat
[0:55:38] Zuldak: Iron star go boom
[0:56:23] Ujai321: tell me about the bird pet from bastion
[0:56:25] SaraDivine: wonder if we'll ever have another scenario where world first raiders actually pet battle for advantage like in nazjatar
[0:56:26] anaksana: its also a lot more annoying when I try to do 4 pet battle world quests on 10 characters and 3 of them use ikky
[0:57:00] SaraDivine: for the benthic gear
[0:57:39] Ujai321: like, 5 years, right
[0:58:05] Ujai321: yeah, 42k kills is not a one-stream-affair
[0:58:20] sk8rbunn: "well yes, but also yes!"
[0:58:27] jgbrit: I didn't realise until today how OP the pet battle bonus xp is. With that and the safari hat you can level a pet from 1 to 25 in about 5 battles
[0:58:31] anker_jym: I feel bad, the Nazmir mount randomly dropped for me when I didn't even know it existed
[0:58:34] Ujai321: speaking of doing something dumb, did you see they reduced the price of the achievement from 70k to 50k?
[0:58:41] Hulkhokie: it's really amazing how much of the game you are exposed to merely by collecting pets (or whatever)
[0:58:52] McScooterson: speaking of, NA squirt soon
[0:58:59] Cyberwolffe: I got enough tokens to buy the heartseeker mana ray but can't buy it on that character since he is level 38 and you have to be 45 to buy it.
[0:59:03] Ujai321: well, it is a daily cooldown
[0:59:06] Zuldak: You can't have done it, it's time gated to be 10k a day
[0:59:07] jeffdmk: also it was combination of multiboxing and botting
[0:59:10] Ujai321: so i dont think anybody could have don eit?
[0:59:13] McScooterson: nah, they changed it before you could overpay
[0:59:13] aerohokie: @Ujai321 which achieve?
[0:59:48] heldtheline: it's a bit annoying that they /yell that you've donated; people can be weird about other people's gold
[0:59:50] McScooterson: I had wondered about the math since every day it'd say you were 20% done when it still said 70k
[0:59:59] GreenArrowed: running dungeons makes so much gold
[1:00:18] Ujai321: @aerohokie it's called "Support Your Local Artisans"
[1:00:52] sk8rbunn: its not the dumbest 10 points ive ever earned
[1:00:58] Hulkhokie: phone says 35 but that's usually off by a few degrees
[1:01:03] brooklynitetv: Bahahaha
[1:01:06] Hulkhokie: oops mt
[1:01:32] Ujai321: that is legendary m+ tank, Skari
[1:01:40] Ujai321: of course she got to 461
[1:01:46] Ujai321: i'm surprised it's not higher
[1:02:03] jgbrit: Are you feeling a randomized alt again some point soon?
[1:02:03] Ujai321: and that with a 2
[1:02:12] jeffdmk: you should main tank next patch
[1:02:33] Ujai321: i think this season is gonna DRAG ON quite a bit
[1:02:42] sk8rbunn: prolly a prof cheevo. the all pristine ones are dumb
[1:02:42] Ujai321: (because we are on DRAGONflight, you get it)
[1:02:45] wolfcloudchaser80: You were actually a pretty good blood DK tank.,
[1:02:50] anker_jym: Do you know if Mythic+ has a cap? I know I've read about people who run +30's, but I don't know if it goes higher than that
[1:02:52] jgbrit: Ahh yeh fair point
[1:03:02] jeffdmk: @Ujai321 is going to or already has?
[1:03:15] Zuldak: You're a good tank tho
[1:03:23] Ujai321: where is support on that list?
[1:03:26] samxox: what about healing melee dps, like mistweavers?
[1:03:41] Zuldak: Support is next to disc priest
[1:03:54] furiforever: 29 Tyran First boss of ToTT one shots some classes
[1:04:05] sk8rbunn: I wanna say I read somewhere that keys stop scaling at 49, but couldnt tell you where I read that
[1:04:30] anker_jym: Dangit, ads started right as she started talking about it lol
[1:04:31] Ujai321: max key level used to be 35
[1:04:39] McScooterson: I still don't understand how you were strong armed into raid tanking
[1:04:44] anker_jym: Thanks chat!
[1:04:51] Ujai321: or maybe that was just for Great Push
[1:05:02] jgbrit: WOW that Diss for disc is REAL
[1:05:23] Ujai321: did you raid this week?
[1:05:32] heldtheline: I'm really, really hoping that we're going to get bards in an expac or two now that they're finally leaning into support specs
[1:05:55] aerohokie: I got strong armed into being main tank for my guild because I had a tank alt that I did keys on
[1:06:20] Kretyn: @heldtheline That's basically what aug is
[1:06:26] Ujai321: unless you play disc
[1:06:32] Ujai321: then you can heal and dps at the same time
[1:07:03] cashthb: we could reunite austria-hungary
[1:07:09] SaraDivine: how many characters have you been running each week?
[1:07:14] Zuldak: I feel like if Hazel had a theme song, it would be I want it that way. You travel your own path
[1:07:24] BoogiePonderosa: hello
[1:07:25] pyrosince1985: Just noticed you had Arfus on your bars, lol
[1:07:30] anaksana: whats the mount drop chance?
[1:07:35] pyrosince1985: Best Boy.
[1:07:44] jgbrit: That reminds me. Yesterday you flew from Ironfirge to Gilneas. I wad watching the vod screaming Dalaran Crater, Dalaran Crater!
[1:08:04] Kurama__95: Hello everyone hazelWave
[1:08:08] furiforever: 50%, it drops or it doesnt :)
[1:08:15] glick66: drop rate always 50% either drop or donâ€™t
[1:08:16] Yenma57: how many mounts are you missing that you can farm?
[1:08:23] jgbrit: Erm, in Legion Dalaran, yeh there is
[1:08:28] SaraDivine: i've been doing my mount farms from oldest to current. i've been at ulduar for a very long time. i barely get myself to do it once a week let alone farm lol
[1:08:31] Jordykat1: hi everyone
[1:08:36] Kretyn: @Kretyn Not thematically, but the principle is there
[1:08:37] pyrosince1985: Ask a mage for a Dalaran Crater portal, you'll troll you by dropping a plain old Valdrakken one
[1:08:40] jgbrit: Yeo
[1:08:44] glick66: drop
[1:08:47] Ujai321: oh wow, that was more precise than i was gonna guess
[1:08:48] jgbrit: ALL my channel points
[1:08:53] jgbrit: On the line haha
[1:09:06] jgbrit: In the middle bit t
[1:09:15] Ujai321: ohhh, asking for directions from twitch chat?
[1:09:16] cashthb: @pyrosince1985 nah, that has a different image & tooltip, you can only troll with og dalaran
[1:09:17] jgbrit: Go to the very end
[1:09:25] jgbrit: In the corner
[1:09:27] glick66: is there something nice dropping from Dazaralor, Uldir and Nyalotha?
[1:09:35] GreenArrowed: i always forget there are portals down there
[1:09:45] SaraDivine: they removed them a long time ago
[1:09:51] pyrosince1985: I think that only shows up during a quest
[1:09:52] GreenArrowed: i thought they were only active for your quests?
[1:09:53] McScooterson: so about those channel points
[1:09:55] jgbrit: What? I saw it the other day
[1:10:00] anker_jym: Yeah was gonna say, they removed those
[1:10:04] michaelmm: The Legion Dala portal still shows up if you are certain quests so it's *technically* true even if it's not in practice!
[1:10:08] jeffdmk: rip channel poits
[1:10:14] Zuldak: So you are both kinda right. If you have a specific quest in legion Dal it will show the crater
[1:10:20] anker_jym: To give him the benefit of the doubt, maybe he was doing a class campaign
[1:10:21] McScooterson: If only points mattered here
[1:10:23] GreenArrowed: were you on a quest? bc that's when they show up now.
[1:10:24] cashthb: quick, make up some nonsense Brit and gaslight Hazel into thinking it's her fault for not finding it!
[1:10:28] McScooterson: much like Who's Line
[1:10:31] BoogiePonderosa: they fixed the bug in Tindral Sageswift that instantly filled your vigor when hitting Whirling Surge on lift-off  :(
[1:10:32] Kretyn: oooooooo xD
[1:10:39] SaraDivine: the wyrmrest temple one shows up if you have the chromie quest in your log. i'll use that sometimes
[1:10:57] BoogiePonderosa: hazelShiny hazelShiny hazelShiny
[1:11:18] jgbrit: I only saw it the other day and remembered thinking, oh I thought that was removed
[1:12:04] McScooterson: yeah if you were on a class hall toon it might still be there
[1:12:08] cashthb: maybe a mage played 3d chess and put it there to troll you out of your channel points
[1:12:17] cashthb: nothing's beneath those people
[1:12:31] Ujai321: do you have a mage, cash?
[1:12:32] McScooterson: @cashthb you really do enjoy treading the line eh?
[1:13:00] cashthb: yes, I'm proad mage!
[1:14:30] marbared: Finally got the legendary drop last week. Now I'm stalled on the "kill the raid bosses" progression bug so no legendary for this week's raid. /sigh
[1:14:31] McScooterson: ma'am, she was sitting there
[1:15:02] jeffdmk: why didnt you do freehold first and then the dailies while waiting on the lockouts?
[1:15:14] GreenArrowed: oh that's good
[1:15:18] Ujai321: how is moose, generally speaking?
[1:15:35] anker_jym: The wife and I are so cat hungry right now, it's insane. We just want to be in a financially stable place, and make sure the kids are old enough
[1:15:49] furiforever: He needs a Hiss translator
[1:16:10] BoogiePonderosa: pushups?
[1:16:16] saga_no: I'm back ;D (It was just a quick Character creation sesh with the DM) ;P
[1:16:41] Zuldak: Hopefully it's just gas
[1:16:42] sk8rbunn: what class
[1:16:43] McScooterson: growing pains?
[1:16:45] GreenArrowed: @saga_no how was it? i've been thinking about finding a table to join.
[1:17:21] saga_no: @GreenArrowed I had done most of it already by myself, so it was just making sure my background and character traits 'made sense' :)
[1:17:34] cashthb: it's warmer, he no longer needs excess fat
[1:17:47] cashthb: maybe that is
[1:17:49] GreenArrowed: @saga_no nice, i love a session 0 to get things squared away
[1:17:59] saga_no: @GreenArrowed We're using DnDBeyond for the character sheets and the game play - so I'm excited to see how DnDBeyond is gameplay wise; I've only used Roll20
[1:18:14] anker_jym: We just go to my sister's house and play with her cat to placate the need lol
[1:18:26] GreenArrowed: @saga_no oh i love dndbeyond! i use it for my solos all of the time.
[1:18:32] saga_no: @GreenArrowed I was the only player who showed up, so it wasn't a true Sesh0 unfortunately - but the DM just looked over my sheet and made sure everything was put in
[1:18:39] Ujai321: did he pounce on the baby yet, to play with him
[1:19:09] McScooterson: Have been hounding shelter sites daily for the perfect for us fur to show up
[1:19:25] alexandrunst: wait what toddler? tneKhadgarWut
[1:19:26] Ujai321: oh yeah, he probably is heavier than your human nephew
[1:19:41] BoogiePonderosa: hazelYikes
[1:20:01] saga_no: My Dad's dog dislikes children age 6-10. They're too unpredictable. He's fine with younger and older children, though
[1:20:05] McScooterson: those parents were lucky moose is a good boi
[1:20:12] dicemeister23: I love that you specify human
[1:20:23] saga_no: (Dad's dog is nearly 70kg tho... so  a tad chonkier than Moose)
[1:20:36] anker_jym: Do you have any non human toddlers then?
[1:20:42] Ujai321: but not for long!
[1:20:52] melodramaticbat: my dog is terrified of children but they always run up to him because hes a big fluff
[1:21:33] WhippWhapp: o/ TGIF
[1:21:54] Ujai321: i really do know nothing of PvP, but i do wonder if 3 people at half health could have been translated into one person at 0 health
[1:21:55] dicemeister23: Our loving Akita bit my daughter 2 years ago, very tragic day. We were able to find her a very loving kid free home and have kept in contact since then but I am too cautious of all dogs now
[1:21:57] WhippWhapp: I see @HazelNuttyGames has her serious game face on today! <3
[1:22:07] furiforever: You reminded me I am at 72% on the Vicious mount and i need to finish it but man shuffle has been rough lately.
[1:22:48] jgbrit: When are you planning to make the move from scrolwheel to keys?
[1:23:08] jgbrit: ^English hars
[1:23:10] Ujai321: i dont think there is a plan
[1:23:12] jgbrit: Hard
[1:23:14] McScooterson: jg with the important questions
[1:23:45] jgbrit: I'm only curious because I know its been annoying Hazel
[1:23:52] wolfcloudchaser80: I love how resto druids get CC'd, but those tree-pets just keep on healing away
[1:23:58] BoogiePonderosa: scroll wheel?
[1:24:48] heldtheline: I was going to say that at least they're on your side but... only for a few matches hazelYikes
[1:24:54] pokirane: happy little trees
[1:24:56] GreenArrowed: i'm finally working on getting mmy hunter geared up to try to get my score up. the mount is so cute this season.
[1:25:02] McScooterson: @BoogiePonderosa hazel uses her scroll wheel to swap between friendly targets
[1:25:05] Ujai321: @BoogiePonderosa if you watch hazel's party frames, when the white outline switches... she is doing that with her mouse wheel
[1:25:35] BoogiePonderosa: ah ok cool thanks!
[1:26:10] BoogiePonderosa: haha
[1:26:24] BoogiePonderosa: "bad.. bad.. danger.. dead."
[1:26:33] jgbrit: Druids seems to be so much more mana intensive than priest or shammy
[1:26:42] Ujai321: cant be hot all the time
[1:26:56] McScooterson: booooo
[1:27:02] Ujai321: you know what
[1:27:06] Ujai321: fair
[1:27:23] imaqttpiegg: Be Humble
[1:27:25] saga_no: Is that a .... beaver hunter pet?
[1:28:00] Ujai321: i didnt even know we had beavers in the game
[1:28:25] saga_no: DO any of y'all know if there are tameable raccoons for hunter pets in the game?
[1:28:25] McScooterson: mostly sure we had beavers before ducks
[1:28:31] Cabbageman007: Freehold luck?
[1:28:45] Ujai321: @Cabbageman007 none so far
[1:28:55] anker_jym: I didn't realize Solo Shuffle was cross faction too!
[1:29:02] Cabbageman007: slootFistLove
[1:29:23] BoogiePonderosa: "hikes?"
[1:29:36] sk8rbunn: no raccoons, can do skunks or beavers though
[1:29:46] wolfcloudchaser80: If she says "Ice" twice in a row, I can't help but add "baby."
[1:29:58] saga_no: aw...
[1:30:14] saga_no: Trash Pandas are my favorite animal
[1:30:31] saga_no: Because they aren't a part of the natural fauna here... I've never seen one IRL
[1:30:34] Ujai321: @wolfcloudchaser80 well, how could you not when you are Under Pressure
[1:30:46] heldtheline: WoW doesn't have a good track record when it comes to raccoon pets. Poor Socks hazelCry
[1:30:52] Zuldak: Moose has a new mortal enemy.. the bush
[1:31:35] saga_no: !!!
[1:31:38] Zuldak: :O
[1:31:39] wolfcloudchaser80: @Ujai321 Oh man, that's like two references deep. Respect!
[1:31:40] BoogiePonderosa: hazelLove
[1:31:49] cashthb: aw, he found jis own dinner?
[1:31:52] Gurottesquex: Awww
[1:32:01] Ujai321: he was bbarking up the wrong tree?
[1:32:28] McScooterson: noooo I forgot I used the last of the good green tea
[1:32:32] saga_no: I've seen a video of a man handing out hotdogs to like 20-30 raccoons on his front porch and it's SO CUTE... the raccoons sit patiently and wait for their hotdog <3
[1:32:34] tonibeeswax: Did you buy anything from the trade port?
[1:32:42] Zuldak: I've heard possums can be nice pets
[1:33:06] cashthb: you woulnd't say hi to a racoon if it wanted to say hi?
[1:33:17] Ujai321: "i keep a one pound bag of chinise gun powder" - hazel, 2024
[1:33:55] MaddiDJ4: I keep a little pop up kettle and various teas in the back corner of my desk because people just keep giving it to me lol. itâ€™s a nice treat while I work though
[1:33:56] Ujai321: unspent talent points, smh. i thought this was peak gaming
[1:34:26] Ujai321: i would argue it grows better than most weeds
[1:34:35] jgbrit: This creepy ass mount though
[1:34:46] imaqttpiegg: I thought you got this back in bfa lols
[1:34:58] wolfcloudchaser80: @saga_no We're not feeding them by hand, but we do have some little grey fox friends that show up outside our front window. They're even curious about us instead of scared.
[1:35:04] HalcyonBeing: Install an InstaHot for instant tea
[1:35:12] Ujai321: @jgbrit thanks, i dont like it either. but we killed 42k trolls for it
[1:35:25] saga_no: @wolfcloudchaser80 Aaw cute!
[1:35:27] cashthb: why would you want a tea shop in your house? you already paid for the tea
[1:35:29] jgbrit: Nope HeyGuys
[1:35:34] BoogiePonderosa: haha
[1:35:34] HalcyonBeing: barring that a Zojirushi water boiler so you always have it hot a t a cheaper price
[1:35:37] Zuldak: Man I saw 3 purples drop and thought it was the mount
[1:35:43] Ujai321: i have never like the blood tick
[1:35:53] MaddiDJ4: one time I did a school project where I made a poster saying that there should be a morning warm drink bar. coffee, tea, cocoa and the sort. for some reason everyone thought I meant alcoholic, we were in high school hazelCry
[1:36:08] Ujai321: especially not when you look at it from underneath while it flies
[1:36:13] Ujai321: it has SO MANY TEETH
[1:36:17] HalcyonBeing: i have something similar to that too. got the zojirushi for my parents who drink hot water every day constantly
[1:36:22] Zuldak: I learned that loot is determined when a mob spawns. I always thought it was determined on mob death
[1:36:45] jgbrit: Is it a underrot mount I gather?
[1:37:17] Ujai321: blood feaster?
[1:37:26] Ujai321: ah
[1:37:39] BoogiePonderosa: gahhh!
[1:37:46] HalcyonBeing: there's the blurple variant too
[1:37:48] Zuldak: There is nothing pleasing about this mount D:
[1:38:00] Zuldak: It's a flying tick
[1:38:02] HalcyonBeing: spider bat
[1:38:06] BoogiePonderosa: holes in the leg webbing WutFace NotLikeThis
[1:38:08] jgbrit: Ewwwww
[1:38:08] Ujai321: we dont have to like the same things :)
[1:38:11] wolfcloudchaser80: I think this is based on an undead unit from WC3
[1:38:12] heldtheline: oh those tendrils move; i never noticed that before. ack
[1:38:23] jeffdmk: hazel you are odd
[1:38:29] saga_no: I Do have a soft spot for the "ugly" mounts
[1:38:53] HalcyonBeing: i love that they added all the portals for belameth and that they added a portal to belameth to SW
[1:39:06] anker_jym: So how do we feel about the Argus mount?
[1:39:10] GreenArrowed: very much a burn the house down situation for me
[1:39:11] Zuldak: Some people like fox mounts or dragons or bright colored birds. Hazel liked the giant tick bug
[1:39:13] saga_no: I mean - I use Lucid Nightmare on all toons except for like.. 2. But I still like the mounts like the Blood Feaster
[1:39:17] jgbrit: I just thank the gods there isn't a tarantula mount. That genuinely is the day I become a FFXIV main
[1:39:21] cashthb: I'm sure it'd like your blood
[1:39:27] anker_jym: Yes the face one
[1:39:51] HalcyonBeing: why did they nerf this mount so you cant do the 3 vigor surge?
[1:39:56] saga_no: I would lowkey love a tarantula mount, heh
[1:40:02] HalcyonBeing: it doesn't feel any stronger than normal dragonflying
[1:40:06] Zuldak: Yeah Eonar is a pain to solo but you only need 4 times to get the skip per character
[1:40:13] heldtheline: that one's disturbing because they tell you that the faces are dead Army of the Light draenei, that's just... wrong
[1:40:21] furiforever: @HalcyonBeing You have to fly by walls first, then you can.
[1:40:22] Zuldak: Saga there is a tarantula from zm
[1:40:24] saga_no: But I like spiders in real life too, though, so...
[1:40:31] HalcyonBeing: @HalcyonBeing but why?
[1:40:40] saga_no: @Zuldak Ooh - cool - Imma need to get that then :)
[1:40:45] cashthb: I'd add an "arachonophobe mode" that would replace every npc with spiders
[1:40:45] HalcyonBeing: it doesn't feel stronger in a way that youwould need to nerf it is my point
[1:40:58] Zuldak: Yeah I think Hazel has it. It's a protoform mount
[1:41:08] HalcyonBeing: i love the hand mounts
[1:41:17] furiforever: Agree, and speaking from expirence, using that one during the Raid is trolling lol
[1:41:21] saga_no: Spooders - not *Tarantula*
[1:41:31] cashthb: their running animation is great, but the ankle part is too static
[1:41:34] saga_no: I want a fluffy tarantula mount ;P
[1:41:39] saga_no: Yeh - tarantulas have "fur"
[1:41:42] jgbrit: ^^^^
[1:41:43] HalcyonBeing: @furiforever LUL agreed
[1:41:45] heldtheline: there's a hunter glyph that makes your dire beast spawn spiders because 'everybody is afraid of spiders'
[1:41:48] furiforever: We have the vicious spider too
[1:41:52] furiforever: from Shadowlands i think

[1:42:01] Zuldak: I was thinking the tarachnid crawler.
[1:42:06] BoogiePonderosa: now i'm imagining a tarantula w/ a perm
[1:42:06] jgbrit: The day we get a fluffy one I'm off
[1:42:13] Zuldak: Which is a protoform and not hairy
[1:42:29] wolfcloudchaser80: I saw a tarantula in the wild for the first time last year. It had an oddly jaunty, care-free walk as it went across the desert.
[1:42:33] heldtheline: oh no
[1:42:36] Zuldak: I blame the spider for this
[1:42:38] lastround: WAYTOODANK

[1:42:46] asianpersuasion117: HOW ??
[1:42:50] Pathstrider: new affix?
[1:42:51] BoogiePonderosa: what th--
[1:42:51] saga_no: Holy Glitch Batman
[1:42:56] lykynn: lol
[1:43:00] marbared: Hazel broke WoW!
[1:43:08] Zuldak: That would be a hell of an affix
[1:43:12] asianpersuasion117: welcome to hazel stream on how to break wow
[1:43:20] furiforever: new MDI strat
[1:43:24] Zuldak: Just randomly porting people around
[1:43:59] heldtheline: an affix with leashing would be interesting; it'd make trash so much more dangerous
[1:44:00] Zuldak: It is intended
[1:44:14] PeModyne: there was some crazy player snap tech in atal dazar back in bfd
[1:44:21] cashthb: it's weird there is a loading screen there, i know newer zones are more detailed and such but I'm pretty sure I could teleport from the edge of nagrad to shatrath
[1:44:22] wolfcloudchaser80: That was  a feature in EQ. Mobs that summoned players were notoriously difficult to solo
[1:44:24] PeModyne: er bfa
[1:44:29] PeModyne: sorry to much sod xD
[1:44:43] cashthb: ...with out a loading screen - that was the point
[1:44:57] anker_jym: Imagine if they let you make a human character with a Harlan model lol
[1:45:23] PeModyne: the secret tech to getting sharkbait is to get him in the dawn of the infinite mount
[1:45:39] exalted1715: thats wher i got him 2 weeks ago
[1:46:11] PeModyne: everytime i see it drop its turned into sharkbait crackers lol
[1:46:43] heldtheline: sending good shuffling vibes hazelLove
[1:46:47] Zuldak: So iirc the reason they snap back players is because they didn't want teams to run boss to boss ignoring trash and then vanish or shadow meld to drop agro and ignore it all
[1:47:05] cashthb: omg, poor mage
[1:47:05] UncleVinny: go hazel! show em who's boss
[1:47:12] cashthb: that's nasty
[1:47:17] heldtheline: oh i thought was another druid
[1:47:44] Zuldak: As a druid I get slightly offended when I see hunters with pets of my forms
[1:48:17] Zuldak: Never forget the insult in under bog of a hunter taming a druid
[1:48:24] heldtheline: @Zuldak are you afraid that someone will try to tame you?
[1:48:51] Zuldak: Yes
[1:49:09] Zuldak: Bad enough when someone decides to mount me without asking
[1:49:39] riatla7: this isnt freehold

[1:51:43] sence_00: oh ya i feel that, I lost like 5 matches in a row earlier this week and Im too pained to get back in
[1:52:29] Hippwn: what abaout flabby does he do arena with you sometimes
[1:53:21] marbared: That poor mage is gonna get a hunter complex
[1:53:53] sence_00: its long grind that for sure
[1:53:57] HalcyonBeing: I feel incapable as a healer in 3s. especially solo shuffle. 2s is whatever, but for some reason the 3rd person, especially the uncoordinate ones are so hard
[1:56:16] cashthb: why is the mop soundtrack playing in ravenholdt, something's really wrong with your music Hazel
[1:56:19] jeffdmk: is there currently a good way to check for mog across multiple relams?
[1:56:46] cashthb: *blackrook hold actually
[1:57:07] jeffdmk: I am on it but i still have to check relams one by one
[1:57:14] JoelTheElephant: i manually went through every server on undermine exchange before realizing there was just a spot that showed the cheapest
[1:57:51] jeffdmk: oh great found it thank you
[1:58:02] JoelTheElephant: ya i found that out after wasting 30 minutes :')
[1:58:17] HalcyonBeing: wait where's the option for cheapest?

[2:04:47] dreamwell_: Hazel, when you have a sec to breathe and answer - just curious what your personal method of gearing for PvP has been/what it's been like :)
[2:05:31] mcxoney: you inspired me to try pvp and now im addicted lol
[2:06:13] dreamwell_: I seem to always struggle with getting gear past the honor set :(
[2:06:24] cashthb: you can get the honor set from like 2 epic bgs
[2:06:34] digitaldave71: Hazel, what are the extra shapes on your shapeshift bar? Looks like there's a couple more than I have on my Druid.
[2:06:48] HalcyonBeing: you can do shuffle, epic battle ground win once a day, the weekly pvp quests, etc give some conquest
[2:06:49] jgbrit: What's the difference between pve and pvp gear?
[2:06:56] bellzzar1: if you do shuffle has a healer you are garenteed 50 conquest even if you 0-6
[2:07:05] GreenArrowed: @jgbrit pvp gear all has vers on it
[2:07:06] jgbrit: As in why do you need different gear
[2:07:07] azumeraa: if you don't have honor you can craft pvp gear/buy it on ah/make an order too
[2:07:09] digitaldave71: Cool, thanks
[2:07:19] HalcyonBeing: pvp gear has an ilvl that's increased only when in PVP, and you can upgrade the PVE ilvl with work. @jgbrit
[2:07:31] dreamwell_: Do you prefer to heal or dps in PvP?
[2:07:54] jgbrit: Ahh okay interesting
[2:07:57] chops6965: how do you find top players in your class?
[2:08:09] necrowoof: theres a website called *** that has all the top players by spec and all their gear
[2:08:28] HalcyonBeing: of course there are other mild stat differences too depending on the piece of gear that's BIS for PVE @jgbrit
[2:08:32] azumeraa: @chops6965 ***
[2:08:34] bellzzar1: ***
[2:08:46] HalcyonBeing: @necrowoof i think i know the one you're talking about and i use it
[2:08:52] dreamwell_: lol
[2:08:52] chops6965: thanks
[2:08:54] azumeraa: ohh sorry, *** tells you everything about pvp
[2:09:02] blueboywiz: drustvar is not a bad site
[2:09:07] necrowoof: murlok io
[2:09:09] saga_no: The Bot eats anything that looks like an url
[2:09:11] sence_00: lol this reads like trolling
[2:09:11] dreamwell_: love *** i get all my info from there
[2:09:21] Zuldak: Ok Harlan, cough up the bird
[2:09:24] dreamwell_: :D
[2:09:37] azumeraa: @necrowoof thanks ^^'
[2:09:46] bellzzar1: murlok io has the current top ranked for each spec and class
[2:10:47] saga_no: Still no Mage, eh?
[2:10:52] jeffdmk: There are other ways to get more chances
[2:11:15] GreenArrowed: is mage the only one you don't have?
[2:11:28] Zuldak: If you were to make a mage what would their spec be?
[2:11:40] witchhobbit: arcane!
[2:11:43] azumeraa: should we remind you mage can be gnome?
[2:11:47] jeffdmk: disc mage
[2:11:52] witchhobbit: just for purple pink
[2:11:55] Zuldak: Wow shots fired at mages
[2:11:55] saga_no: I found Arcane to be the least frustrating of the 3
[2:11:55] Kaseyfullofjoy: Sameee no mage gang
[2:11:57] McScooterson: fire for sure
[2:12:23] profroo22: profroo22 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 30 months, currently on a 30 month streak! Good luck today Hazel! hazelWave  Your streams are always such a joy  hazelShiny hazelLove
[2:12:23] Streamlabs: profroo22 just subscribed with Tier 1!
[2:12:29] Hippwn: The point the point is that mages are the best class of the game!
[2:12:34] MaddiDJ4: gnome frost mage because of those cute little crystal earrings they can have. I think they look like icecicles
[2:12:34] saga_no: But then I'm *terrible* at anything but Shadow Priest - where I'm mediocre at best LUL
[2:12:42] Zuldak: Arc mage is kinda cool. Build charges with arc blast and then unload with magic missile
[2:12:53] witchhobbit: LUL
[2:13:02] jgbrit: At the detriment of getting removed from the channel, my feelings towards gnomes are akin to that of your feelings towards disc priest Hazel. LUL
[2:13:04] witchhobbit: yeah i wish they had more healing
[2:13:04] DapherCake: I just made a monk mechagnome and I can't believe the name Trashbot wasn't taken lol
[2:13:07] Kaseyfullofjoy: Mages are missing the whimsy I desperately crave
[2:13:09] saga_no: THe lack of self-heals on mages is the reason I don't play them much
[2:13:20] saga_no: Yup. DoTs for the win.
[2:13:42] necrowoof: vulpera mage are great for mount farming because of their racial
[2:13:46] jgbrit: Like WHY do they have 3 fingers?
[2:14:00] anker_jym: But hear me out. On SoD you CAN play a healer Mage lol
[2:14:08] cashthb: mages lack the well tought out rotation I desperately crave :(
[2:14:12] daws001: evoker accomplished my mage hybrid fantasy: fire and frost dps & chrono healer
[2:14:30] witchhobbit: they are great for farming because teleports and shimmer/blink + chrono shift
[2:14:45] dreamwell_: in all my years (since BC) of WoW I've only played Arcane mage.. I finally started frost a couple of months ago and am really enjoying it
[2:14:50] dreamwell_: still prefer the drood though
[2:15:06] DapherCake: I just can't get in to rogues they feel clunky
[2:15:20] jgbrit: Do you know what portals you can buy for mages? Dalaran Crater Portal ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚
[2:16:05] MaddiDJ4: I cannot get behind Pally. at all, I have one at like 65 and itâ€™s such a fight to get me to play her
[2:16:14] McScooterson: @jgbrit vindication
[2:16:22] jeffdmk: there could be a glyph for that if you care enough
[2:16:24] jgbrit: HeyGuys
[2:16:34] Hippwn: Mages have no need of minions they bend time and space to their will and can shield and turn back time for health haha we all like what we like and I like mages as you can tell
[2:16:35] dreamwell_: I've also always played Resto/Boomkin.. I decided I wanted to try feral for the first time.. is it sad that I had to level a whole new druid in order to learn feral? lOL
[2:16:43] anker_jym: Subtlety can be a bit complicated. I say as someone who has a Sub Rogue and loves it
[2:16:44] jeffdmk: for it to be more dramatic
[2:16:52] cashthb: PogChamp
[2:17:02] McScooterson: @dreamwell_ nah, I level whole new toons to learn new specs too
[2:17:09] witchhobbit: sameeeeee
[2:17:45] quinnhasnousername: been there, done that
[2:17:54] dreamwell_: @McScooterson I'm glad it's not just me! I have a difficult time at max level being dumped with a new set of spells and abilities lol
[2:17:55] quinnhasnousername: i leveled arcane just to try to understand it
[2:17:59] DapherCake: I love the idea of the pally healing spec but its so different and hard to grasp lol
[2:18:01] Zuldak: I have 10 druids all 450 ilvl. You're fine
[2:18:07] dicemeister23: I had made the mistkae of using 2 expansion boosts on druids.. ad then being overhwlmed by buttons.. Finally leveled one and still don't understand
[2:18:08] witchhobbit: @MaddiDJ4 me but with demon hunter. the only time i needed to use a boost from preordering
[2:18:11] anker_jym: She's a catfish!
[2:18:20] jgbrit: I was literally typing that lol
[2:18:29] saga_no: @dreamwell_ You're in good company - I've leveled a Holy Priest exclusively in Holy Spec - zero dungeons
[2:18:35] helheimr: I have 4 druids to learn all specs, but its easier to do them all the same so they all feral now
[2:18:36] necrowoof: best name ever
[2:18:40] dreamwell_: I still haven't leveled a Dracthyr cause all the abilities at once and then at 60 is intimidating to me lol
[2:19:09] witchhobbit: i'd rather try to fight myself playing rogue over demon hunter which is saying something lol
[2:19:11] dicemeister23: @dreamwell_ Dracthyr is actually very low APM to understand.. not many buttons to push at all
[2:19:33] dicemeister23: Devastation is like 3 buttons.. no lie lol
[2:19:41] dreamwell_: "APM"? :\
[2:19:56] Zuldak: The eredar lock with green fire is so awesome
[2:19:59] dicemeister23: sorry APM = abilities per minute
[2:20:08] cashthb: you could make an eredar firamage who larps as a warlock
[2:20:11] dreamwell_: Gotcha!
[2:20:13] Zuldak: Oh something you can do is collect the warlock demon skins
[2:20:15] dreamwell_: makes sense
[2:20:22] saga_no: I'm gonna level a Draenei Warlock once this DnD campaign gets going (because I'll be playing a Tiefling Warlock in the campaign)
[2:20:31] Zuldak: Like one drops off Illhoof in kara
[2:20:32] jeffdmk: for most people it is actions per min but for me it is actions per month
[2:20:40] saga_no: I'll also make a new BG3 savefile with a Tiefling Warlock, hehehe
[2:21:03] witchhobbit: i was playing my blood dk in the emerald dream and she's barely geared and it felt great. just slow lol
[2:21:09] jeffdmk: it was just a joke but the other idea is fun
[2:21:17] DapherCake: Nothing will beat that XP boost winds of experience. So many 60-70s leveled. Its so difficult without it once you've had it lol
[2:21:39] witchhobbit: same LUL
[2:21:51] jgbrit: My AMP is net 0. I only play around 2-5 hours per week. That's why I love watching Hazel, I play vicariously though her
[2:21:57] witchhobbit: i was thinking that in college
[2:22:10] Ujai321: you know what? you should think about it until you have the perfect answer Kappa
[2:22:31] Zuldak: Idk I have kinda a fear of letting others down so I remove myself a lot from others cause they can't be disappointed if I'm not there
[2:22:48] necrowoof: the key to success is low expectations
[2:23:22] melodramaticbat: @necrowoof the best life advice
[2:23:29] witchhobbit: yeah that is avoiding things because you're anxious which i do all the time
[2:23:36] saga_no: I somehow lucked out on that front and got myself a diagnosis where Hermit Mode is the safest for my wellbeing... heh
[2:23:54] jeffdmk: agree just low your expectations to the point they are already met
[2:24:06] melodramaticbat: i feel the same so I just don't do the things that I know will make me anxious but then not doing them makes me anxious LUL
[2:24:12] Ujai321: a good answer for you seemed to be: put on comfy excercise cloths after getting up
[2:24:17] witchhobbit: i mean i thought you should never feel like you have to get out of your comfort zone but idk
[2:24:25] prowl_shady_fox: @HazelNuttyGames would you still play wow if by accident blizzard deleted all your pets and mounts?
[2:24:34] Zuldak: Do keep in mind we are twitch chat and not licensed therapists
[2:25:00] saga_no: OOh... THe Return of Midnight Farm Tuesdays
[2:25:02] Waxx90: Blizzard here taking notes
[2:25:04] saga_no: oh boi
[2:25:06] witchhobbit: LUL
[2:25:10] jeffdmk: what if they removed pets and mounts from the game
[2:25:15] prowl_shady_fox: @HazelNuttyGames nice billionaire mindset
[2:25:18] chops6965: love your attitude...i get to do it all again!!!
[2:25:40] Ujai321: canadian dollars
[2:25:42] saga_no: I swear that Midnight grind is forever seared into my brain....
[2:25:50] heldtheline: I like 'rich Hazel': where is my cheese?
[2:25:57] saga_no: I think it was around that time I started hanging out in here
[2:26:02] jgbrit: Ver is my Villions of dollars
[2:26:44] cashthb: it's all about the attitude Hazel, you could have bought your garden a long time ago, but you're refusing to move to South Africa
[2:26:52] saga_no: brb
[2:26:53] MaddiDJ4: is this like the stop buying Starbucks to buy a house thing? Hazel stops buying cheese?
[2:26:54] Jack_the_Dipper: I have some nice Gouda and Old Amsterdamer cheese in my fridge kaatGasm nobGASM
[2:26:58] witchhobbit: i would have so many more cats
[2:27:01] witchhobbit: and dogs
[2:27:57] Ujai321: backflips
[2:28:30] goplacidly56: my shep used to run and spin and run and spin then catch the frisbee lol
[2:28:44] goplacidly56: was so cute
[2:28:52] Ujai321: make it a fun word. moose doesnt speak english. it could be anything!
[2:28:54] anistrasza: I love your nightelf and blood helf transmog
[2:29:02] goplacidly56: love the dog dancing
[2:29:24] goplacidly56: theres a golden that is amazing
[2:29:42] jeffdmk: training moose to do your crafting
[2:30:03] MrSonicgen: Hiya.
[2:30:32] Ujai321: 100 pounds is a lot to deadlift
[2:31:07] wolfcloudchaser80: Teach him compromise, he puts his front half in and you lift up the back half. That's how my pup taught me.
[2:31:41] jeffdmk: you could start pumping iron
[2:31:54] bellzzar1: i really hope blood elves get new weapons and shield transmog in the trading post
[2:31:58] GreenArrowed: i would jump in the car for cheese, too
[2:32:18] jeffdmk: what type of cheese?
[2:32:32] jeffdmk: i would hold out for better cheese
[2:32:35] goplacidly56: lol
[2:32:36] Ujai321: bless you indeed
[2:32:37] Perkolate: Havarti is up there?
[2:32:37] languishinglesbian: no, bless YOU
[2:32:43] goplacidly56: Bless u
[2:32:44] MrSonicgen: :D
[2:32:58] losttobaldness: How many attempts in freehold ?
[2:33:27] losttobaldness: :O
[2:33:32] Ujai321: so, around 5k attempts
[2:34:28] cicerospqr: what are u farming?
[2:34:34] Ujai321: imagine if it actually takes you 5 thousand
[2:34:34] chops6965: one of the best things we discovered when we moved to Oregon was Tillamook cheese, soooo good!
[2:34:35] heldtheline: with all the bars in Freehold, it'd be on brand if it was always 5pm
[2:35:28] Curufin_: love the giraffe tshirt!
[2:35:53] JustFrogging: all my pepper seeds sprouted
[2:35:56] Ujai321: so YOU are technically vintage?
[2:35:59] jeffdmk: every run you dont get dice and dont get the mount you should say "no dice"
[2:36:03] heldtheline: thanks, now i feel old
[2:36:09] JustFrogging: thank you :D
[2:36:10] anker_jym: Oh dear
[2:36:23] Ujai321: you are just as vintage as you fell, i guess
[2:36:28] Ujai321: *feel
[2:36:52] Ujai321: i still think Molly shoud have thumbs
[2:37:08] GreenArrowed: i went to a stylist today for a fitting and all of the clothes he brought out for me were basically 90s throwbacks and it made me feel so old. i'm not prepared for "polished" cargos as work wear.
[2:37:11] witchhobbit: did you do love is in the air already?
[2:37:22] Ujai321: i dont think that is how thumbs work, but she might have gotten it to work
[2:37:30] heldtheline: if you're up for it, that would make an interesting stream, seeing you tweak your UI. a lot of people have no idea where to start
[2:37:41] sence_00: @GreenArrowed ya how does going to a stylist work Ive always wondered
[2:38:12] goplacidly56: @heldtheline agree
[2:38:36] Zuldak: There is no love only salt
[2:38:38] GreenArrowed: i went for a free fitting and styling at the universal standard studio in soho because i have 0 biz casual clothes since i've worked from home since march 15 2020.
[2:38:42] Zuldak: Mumble mumble
[2:38:43] Curufin_: i think maybe being able to see you team mates cooldowns as they use them is usefull (addon puts them next to there unit frames)

[2:39:41] Ujai321: not digging the digs anymore, eh
[2:39:58] GreenArrowed: @sence_00 a good stylist will asking you what you don't like, and what feels uncomfortable, figure out your figure/proportions and bring out things that work within that + your likes, then show you how to actually style your clothes vs just putting them on your body.
[2:40:20] Curufin_: if you want to torture chat, you could go for archaology meta achieves ^^

[2:41:33] jgbrit: You could level MollyWobble exclusively IN the Maw to get Mawwalker Mollywobble More Magnificent Maw Makeovers
[2:41:41] cashthb: I think they are just amped on stream due to the bit rate thingy
[2:41:49] Ujai321: @Perkolate i heard Enshrouded is the new Palworld
[2:41:53] GreenArrowed: no one is trying to be in the maw on purpose
[2:42:29] bellzzar1: its under mounts in the options

[2:44:11] tehl00py: tehl00py converted from a Prime sub to a Tier 1 sub! 
[2:44:11] Streamlabs: tehl00py just subscribed with Tier 1!
[2:44:32] ghostie1995: I feel sad for missing any mollywobble content but Iâ€™ve been having a tough time at work and I have less time to watch stream
[2:44:57] tehl00py: thought twas time to change the prime sub
[2:45:03] saga_no: "She sells sea shells by the sea shore" ....
[2:45:24] Jack_the_Dipper: Irish Wrist Watch
[2:45:25] heldtheline: I have a weird housekeeping question: is it better for you if we watch vods here or on youtube?
[2:45:31] azrazil720: a woodchuck would chuck as much wood as a woodchuck could chuck if a woodchuck could chuck wood
[2:45:33] saga_no: Core memory flashback to 2nd grade and a *VERY* picky English teacher... ugh
[2:45:48] saga_no: English as a second language teacher - to be specific
[2:45:51] varyamustang: popcorn reading
[2:46:09] Jack_the_Dipper: A lot of people can't say; Irish Wristwatch
[2:46:28] jeffdmk: Prime minister hazel
[2:46:43] saga_no: Enunciation is important - ...but is it vital to a 8-year-old learning English as a second language? No.
[2:46:56] Ujai321: your actual worst nightmare?
[2:47:08] dastago: have you ever heard a scottish person try to say purple burgular alarm
[2:47:20] dicemeister23: do you still post vods on youtube? I havent even seen anything outside of saturday updates
[2:47:36] HazelNuttyGames: !vods
[2:47:36] Streamlabs: you can watch full Hazel stream VoDs on YouTube! browse here https://www.youtube.com/@HazelNuttyVoDs
[2:47:48] heldtheline: the best people for politics are usually the people who don't want to be in politics
[2:47:51] Ujai321: man i want to ask about that hit dream
[2:47:52] dicemeister23: Got it!
[2:48:03] cashthb: @saga_no I don't even undestand why they teach people for a 2nd language in 2nd grade
[2:48:14] tehl00py: it's tough having a conscience xP
[2:48:23] jgbrit: On that note, would you make more money from a view subbing as per or from the ad rev if they had twitch turbo?
[2:48:41] saga_no: @cashthb Because that's how it's done here; Norwegian and English in parallell from day one (1st grade) - then we add (usually) French or German in the 8th grade
[2:48:53] jgbrit: Like is twitch turbo any good for you
[2:49:07] Ujai321: yeah, the people in politics are usually people that think they know what is best for a lot of people, and those are usually problematic tendencies
[2:49:25] tehl00py: @saga_no so jealous of europeans knowing like 6 languages by the time they're 16 lol
[2:49:45] saga_no: @cashthb Most Norwegian 5-year-old will already have been exposed to *a lot* of English already - so by the time they start school, it makes sense for them to continue learning
[2:50:08] saga_no: Ignore the redundancies in that sentence, lol - engrish hard.
[2:50:17] GreenArrowed: doit
[2:50:18] Ujai321: will you sit there and tell us you are not playing Subnautica?
[2:50:33] jeffdmk: or att random
