[3:37:35] fawthespriest: @wJayto like an escape key, but not esacpe
[3:37:41] lazler1971: you play with any rating subs?
[3:38:05] wJayto: @fawthespriest the /cast [@cursor] spell name macro completely gets rid of the circle and drops it wherever your cursor is placed. so no left click to start it. idk if I’m answering your question properly tho
[3:38:06] MojoZeus: Bullying this warrior after his long work shift
[3:38:11] MojoZeus: insane
[3:38:15] mr_jimmm: what stats do I want on sub rogue these days?
[3:38:25] MojoZeus: DIPPY
[3:38:30] lonesovl: @Pikabooirl what mouse do you use?
[3:38:35] Nvellen: i started playing warrior again
[3:38:44] fawthespriest: @wJayto  yea but i want ot keep the circle
[3:38:44] Nvellen: fucking fun

[3:38:48] FRATERNALFURY: Thats a dent from hell right there
[3:38:53] Nvellen: im super low rated
[3:38:54] Nvellen: but its fun
[3:38:59] Nvellen: its just straight foward
[3:39:02] Nvellen: and the kit doesnt feel bad
[3:39:04] lazler1971: I know arms is meta but something about me loves fury lol
[3:39:11] Doolz51: I just started trying to learn pvp and went war. its really fun
[3:39:25] wJayto: @fawthespriest oh ok I’m not sure bout that brother
[3:39:26] Nvellen: make a dh guide imo
[3:39:28] Nvellen: so i know what to press
[3:39:29] Nvellen: :D
[3:39:40] ctrlbeesy: payoSad
[3:39:43] Doolz51: war is nice because you really cant mess up rotation. and always do good dmg
[3:39:43] Nvellen: "the buttons"
[3:39:45] Nvellen: lol
[3:39:47] fawthespriest: @wJayto np thjx mate -  ANYONE in the chat good with macros?
[3:39:49] Nvellen: i knew youd say that hahaha
[3:39:54] jimmy_irl: payo subs OUT pikabooWork
[3:40:00] Voriq: gnome enjoyer GIGACHAD
[3:41:28] wJayto: @fawthespriest can’t you just right click to cancel it for if you end up not wanting to cast it? I think that’s what I do for ring of frost? or I click both mouse buttons I’m not sure now that I think of it lol
[3:42:08] MojoZeus: damn bro showed out this game W gnome war
[3:42:27] lostspecies58: Jellybean is still with Themove Right?!?!?! @Pikabooirl
[3:42:27] fawthespriest: @wJayto  yea but as i use shift for a modifier, i want to be able to overide the circle with cast @ me... the prob is the circle wont drop, and it wont cast unless i press escape or press a diff key.. so i use a cpl globals with fkn around
[3:42:30] mexirican81: @nvellen arms or fury?
[3:42:48] MojoZeus: @lostspecies58 No they kicked him for not playing DH
[3:42:50] Nvellen: @mexirican81 still on arms bro
[3:43:02] focused_stumbling: man you make me want to get into pvp, but I suck
[3:43:17] mexirican81: @nvellen Niooooce!

[3:43:37] Doolz51: looking into weight loss. would GB and Rice be good for that do you think?
[3:43:58] focused_stumbling: @Doolz51 Throw some brocolli in there too
[3:44:00] Cubic1ne: @Doolz51 Add avocado and you are good
[3:44:15] alllucknoskill: damn insta replacing vince.... feels so unmovelike
[3:44:36] overrrlord12: no frenchfries :((
[3:44:41] Doolz51: I dropped all sugary drinks and sweets. I think the main issue is portion size, like most people id assume
[3:44:42] Garthd: Give up any amount of happnies = weight loss
[3:44:45] MojoZeus: Id rather be in the gulag then stop eating chips are you crazy
[3:44:53] focused_stumbling: I can't figure out what's troll and what's real about Jelly.
[3:45:04] Jervun: why are all 2v2s with a healer? is it OP?
[3:45:07] Missingiscool: to start, never drink sugar drinks or eat bread/pasta
[3:45:10] thetruebeesknees: you could just have celiacs disease like me and not be able to eat bread
[3:45:18] thetruebeesknees: trust me, once i cut out bread, i got abs lmfao.
[3:45:42] focused_stumbling: legit cutting out most sugar from your diet is a huge step to weight loss
[3:46:02] TimmyShoes: brazilian music, nice
[3:46:21] wJayto: @fawthespriest you using the @ me to drop it on your feet? idk if in your scenario you can keep the circle popping up. Probly be best to just adjust to an @ cursor macro.
[3:46:33] MojoZeus: drags his root... bro is using those razor macros
[3:46:38] exteps: AHK learned from pika
[3:46:47] TimmyShoes: pika did you see the scientific study they did breaking down AWC stats?
[3:47:03] TimmyShoes: they proved scientfically that if you play DH in tourney, it means you have tiny pp
[3:47:11] icyice41: just get a catering company boys
[3:47:13] dontstealmycheese: tiny pp
[3:47:14] asalongface: best rogue na/eu @Pikabooirl ?

[3:47:27] TimmyShoes: it's science bro
[3:47:28] matt_caste: best thing i do, and it's unique for everyone, is use a food tracking app. set my calories, set my macros, and just fill the bars each day
[3:47:31] madetherogue: I don't eat, i just pound big red, dr pepper and monsters with insulin
[3:47:41] matt_caste: When I'm prepping for tournies that's what I do

[3:47:48] shad3dspectr3: LMAO
[3:47:52] BearPods1: bro u have a $600 pc??/
[3:47:54] fawthespriest: @wJayto nah im not explaining properlly.. im using at my feet and circle to play at a distance... with 2 diff buttons.. but if my modifier doesnt work it tries to cast circle.. and then it wont let me cast at my feet unless i cancel circle.. so im trying to add a cancel circle command to my at feet macro
[3:47:56] Doolz51: ima be honest, id rather give up happiness than be overweight lmfao
[3:48:13] bobby27444: can you help me get to 1800 mistweaver monk
[3:48:18] focused_stumbling: you find happiness elsewhere lol
