[0:27:20] Korupcija_: ye, that's so dumb
[0:27:34] BigTrout3: ye. old world dragon riding is marginally slower because it can't load as fast Sadge

[0:28:08] Kerelinn7: that sucks but im sure itll get better with time copium
[0:28:10] Snackra: its slower cause dragonflight zones are so much bigger than old zones
[0:28:21] BigTrout3: i just can't fathom how anyone thinks static flying is better
[0:28:47] Sir_Nikotin: It's like 740% vs 830 or something, so not really a big deal

[0:39:35] Nickystr1x: follower dungeons
[0:39:37] MysticalOS: blizzard posted, they were treated as playable characters, targetable by boss mechanics
[0:39:38] Shurafna: Follow dungeons Id guess
[0:39:38] Wiseved: Patch happened
[0:39:41] smolderdaddyuwu: playable toon b/c of the new dungeons
[0:39:41] PPowzer74: think people said connected to followr dungeon
[0:39:44] Crusader226: They were stealing our Aug's buffs. It was hilarious.
[0:39:47] larkhill: they had to change how afflicted were coded to follower dungeon nps'c could find them. this broke things
[0:39:49] Crusader226: He was so damn annoyed
[0:39:50] Nekz3: spaghetticode
[0:39:51] MysticalOS: probably some code that accidentally transferred over from follower dungeon npc code
[0:39:52] kj01a: aug is so broken it can even buff afflicted LUL
[0:39:53] hawckbane: 7-man m+ leak
[0:39:58] Fluffywingman: is there a reward for doing them like xmog or quest achievement?

[0:40:50] ph00lish: ph00lish subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 13 months! chat do you ever just
[0:40:51] MysticalOS: @Fluffywingman honestly biggest rward for doing these races, is to get better at dragon riding. like on tindral you can tell players who can ride from those you can't massively
[0:40:59] Diazanite: driney is gonna come out here and its gonna be like tindral all over again
[0:41:09] goombacci: dragon races are the only time max would go non-verbal

[0:41:43] taxiidk: ban the phrase
[0:41:46] CrappyGamerrr: max could you show m+ havoc talents by chance?
[0:41:47] shareandcare: "too tired of dragonracing" - does dragonflying for rest of the stream in a random location while ranting about reworking frost dks inc
[0:41:48] mcphatty: Drinys dragonriding during rwf almost made Max nonverbal

[0:45:54] rrrawr: 3100 and trying to climb
[0:45:59] smolderdaddyuwu: @Maximum video on YT discussing social dynamics of wow from a BDGG analyst. pretty interesting stuff. imo
[0:45:59] swisher_szn: GIGACHAD
[0:46:01] kingpeace09: they will timthetatman fall guys you
[0:46:03] shareandcare: max what popular streamer has the highest average raider io in his viewerhsip?
[0:46:04] fronkacean: that yt video is crazy
[0:46:06] Adrang: @relimee0 may as well be at this point
[0:46:08] Nox1o: nah, people will whisper the tank mid key and start offering paypal
[0:46:09] TerraTuned: thats content
[0:46:11] ThreesFG: Now that's content
[0:46:19] narthy_poo: I'm 2600 just tanking casually. Don't see a huge point in grinding higher than that
[0:46:26] SCxFaytal: HUH?
[0:46:31] fronkacean: is it the folding tables video
[0:46:39] smolderdaddyuwu: ^^^
[0:46:41] fronkacean: it might be 2 hours long
[0:46:44] swisher_szn: @narthy_poo they really gotta add SOMETHING for hitting 3k score
[0:46:48] fronkacean: and like a year or so long
[0:46:51] smolderdaddyuwu: why its bad to suck at wow
[0:47:03] PopsButNotDad: hey @Maximum, I enjoy watching wow streams and rtwf but I am lacking on a lot of the terminology used during those streams as I don't play WoW. Is there a resource you have in order for someone to go learn what certain terminology means? (example: "Personal")
[0:47:14] smolderdaddyuwu: ahh sick ok. I missed that mb bruh
[0:47:16] fronkacean: o7

[0:47:28] goombacci: actually a cool google docs idea
[0:47:33] SL33PY: and non verbal what that mean
[0:47:36] Nox1o: why would you want to read up ona games terminology you dont even play
[0:47:38] smokeweedz: @PopsButNotDad DansGame
[0:47:38] kelly_mac06: @LuciFeariUm yea so it looks more flamboyant
[0:47:41] seamuscg: @PopsButNotDad *** this reddit post has some
[0:47:45] Therealbrokensword: @fronkacean about to make a WoW glossary
[0:47:45] jaynkumz: need  cheat sheet for wowhead
[0:47:53] HealsAndThat: Been playing this game for a long ass time, but i'd watch a 2 hour video of you explaining that shit LUL
[0:47:55] gonzobone: same with stops
[0:47:55] shareandcare: if someone makes a wow glossary please include "bricked up"
[0:47:56] LuciFeariUm: @Nox1o because you enjoy watching it..?
[0:47:56] Nox1o: personal is your own defensive
[0:48:00] Trippletea: bubble for pally
[0:48:03] unName96: i saw a list on wowhead years ago, don't know if still exist
[0:48:09] larkhill: the main broadcast is usually better at being clear with commentary thats more accessible
[0:48:09] doom_llama: I’ve def seen a WoW glossary forget wear maybe wownoob Reddit or something bnb
[0:48:17] PopsButNotDad: @Nox1o cause I used to play but it was years ago and I don't have the patience and time to play lol. but I like throwing the stream on while I work.
[0:48:18] zeph_6: all 7 of mages personals
[0:48:19] gonzobone: the game is like orders of magnitude more homogenized then it was 10 years ago though
[0:48:21] swisher_szn: mage alter time technically
[0:48:21] dharmist_2: wwhat about "kick"
[0:48:21] rindioh: we also talk about a "wall" @Maximum
[0:48:23] Kethris: Kethris subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 9 months! 
[0:48:25] watnenalex: personal holy cd?
[0:48:25] RobotWizard31: What would you recommend the easiest way to get into doing mythic plus? Do I need to play certain class to get into more or can I play whatever I want and still get into mythic regularly?
[0:48:28] east_8: cries in priest
[0:48:32] kairuxt: kairuxt subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 2 months! Imfiredup the best mage you played along/have in ur guild or your years of wow ?
[0:48:34] Czeski_33: as a hunter i take my personals pretty personal
[0:48:41] wow_noboat: this sounds like a Dr Atnos video or a quazii video, wow for new people
[0:48:41] Trippletea: priest got fade Kappa
[0:48:45] thexreatgamer: by far what are the best trinkets for Demon Hunter
[0:48:49] Adrang: @east_8 flash heal, fade, dp?
[0:48:49] Troniin: Then you have the shaman who has the reverse personal and does extra damage to themselves lol
[0:48:51] Codester_remix: HUH
[0:48:53] TerraTuned: @dharmist_2 interrupt cast of enemy
[0:48:55] ThreesFG: Same with "kick"
[0:48:59] PepikStep: what is babee step
[0:49:00] Hred5: firedup easy the best mage itw
[0:49:01] SCxFaytal: imfiredup is GOATED
[0:49:02] watnenalex: cries in fade :(
[0:49:09] gonzobone: "kick", "stop", "personal" etc
[0:49:10] dreww: surprised wowhead doesn't have a jargon glossary
[0:49:10] DuCkiii3: best multiclasser in wow ? in your opinion
[0:49:13] Dlaze001: Max, do you ever think MRT notes will be widly used in M+ (I assume they are used in MDI / TGP), but I rarely see them used in High push keys
[0:49:14] dardrayx: and now he evolved after the surgery
[0:49:16] goombacci: or sometimes int
[0:49:17] Trippletea: if your character is a Nelf... shadow meld :p
[0:49:18] arigold___: except beam :)
[0:49:23] Konijn246: @RobotWizard31 the low keys are easy, the answer to this question fully depends on how high you want to go. i would recommend playing what you enjoy and just going in
[0:49:24] wow_noboat: stop, aoe stun or similar
[0:49:27] mycrankyazz: hi max, have you tried windwalker in dungeons this season?
[0:49:27] Lindorn_: or tanks saying wall
[0:49:36] fronkacean: oh its the squirting song
[0:49:40] HealsAndThat: I call every personal ''wall '', and every interrupt '' kick ''. It's faster I guess
[0:49:41] NotLebronJamess: tried fire mage. it’s fun af but I cannot comprehend how to track everything
[0:49:42] ATOMICxIRISH: pvp terminology is something I have no idea about even though I've played the game for years
[0:49:42] narthy_poo: It's crazy as someone who started when BWL released on vanilla to see how the game has evolved.
[0:49:44] kairuxt: Sad your team Dallas stars didnt make it in the playoffs.. :D Lets go Chiefs
[0:49:45] ciggyman: squidward walking ass song
[0:49:52] wow_noboat: barrier, a literaly zone that is a big damage barrier, looks like a dome
[0:49:55] Voyburke: was "kick" the only interrupt in the game for a while or something?
[0:49:55] cannibalcanyon: TrollDespair
[0:49:55] swisher_szn: let us send crests to alts blizzard!
[0:49:55] ciggyman: KEKw
[0:49:57] Nox1o: nah, you need like 600 to have everything i think
[0:50:05] Nox1o: a days work
[0:50:05] cannibalcanyon: faeline stomp looks great now, visually
[0:50:06] Nox1o: at most
[0:50:06] gwenmh: we need catchup on crests
[0:50:08] itsmiraix: You dont play stomb in dungeons or do you?
[0:50:08] Yagr6: squirting in my ear
[0:50:08] ciggyman: u love it
[0:50:12] Lexxury: Is there a way we get your dh ui somehow? @maximum
[0:50:21] Masonosan1: YOu dont have to run stomp in dung
[0:50:22] daiger5o: Blue sliken linen
[0:50:22] Masonosan1: most dont
[0:50:23] Lexxury: We can get*
[0:50:23] merzicdh: i certainly do not use serenity or stomp in keys. clones and bone dust all the way
[0:50:26] NotLebronJamess: saw a +25 listing with ‘WME’ in the title. we’re they trolling?
[0:50:28] smolderdaddyuwu: @fronkacean is that reaction of the folding ideas video somewhere?
[0:50:33] gretriku: @Lexxury AtrocityUI
[0:50:35] narthy_poo: @voyburke no but it was one of few interrupts without conditional requirements like warriors pummel and berserker stance
[0:50:36] zachl_: my dh i play with swapped to double silken and his dmg skyrocketed
[0:50:37] fronkacean: @smolderdaddyuwu nope, mustve been a really long time ago
[0:50:37] Hedylamarr_: wait you don’t play faeline?
[0:50:38] zachl_: boots bad
[0:50:41] Ferg_6: When a new class or spec is released how do you determine who is going to main it? is it based on who enjoys the class/spec, or do you guys assign it to someone?
[0:50:41] ciggyman: what is WME? ive seen that in lfg
[0:50:49] LuciFeariUm: @Dlaze001 the problem is you cant widly use something like mrt note because notes requires having the persons name, then making a note, then sending a note, then confirming the notes work, then actually doing the key
[0:50:52] wow_noboat: war mode enabled
[0:50:53] smolderdaddyuwu: @fronkacean aw damn. aight
[0:51:02] woobackjack: @ciggyman WoW Made Easy, community for people to play together on discord usually
[0:51:08] Nox1o: do keys to drop one
[0:51:10] SCxFaytal: i feel like the boots do way more than the double silken
[0:51:10] Lexxury: @gretriku is it not a wa setup?
[0:51:11] HealsAndThat: You have a lot of gold man ;o
[0:51:12] RobotWizard31: @Maximum What would you recommend the easiest way to get into doing mythic plus? Do I need to play certain class to get into more or can I play whatever I want and still get into mythic regularly?

[1:04:05] ThreesFG: Maw was V dog shit
[1:04:06] shea4it: make it like a lil nas x music video
[1:04:06] smolderdaddyuwu: @gulliblelion jokes on you, I paid in advance.
[1:04:06] Tsinis: forbiding from mounting was the worst  design ever
[1:04:06] Momozzex: YEP
[1:04:08] jonpelf: target demo: masochists
[1:04:08] msemmadream: no fun only suffering
[1:04:09] IamWambo_: But hell isnt fun so they should make it aweful to play
[1:04:11] goblingher: it was not a fun place, now we are here killing everything making it fun
[1:04:14] twez11: what io score do you think it Will be for the rank 0.1 title in m+? @maximum
[1:04:18] goombacci: didnt get purple reward ICANT
[1:04:20] guynormally: Maybe that was Blizzard's mindset behind D4
[1:04:27] Therealbrokensword: no mounts in the maw had to be the most cringe design choice in some time
[1:04:29] patti221: they could have put some ways to sneak around the Maw to make it more fun in the beginning.
[1:04:35] gonzobone: how super is it tho
[1:04:38] goombacci: oh damn blazemore dude is here
[1:04:38] sweetingsting: "better than most"

[1:04:47] kadashy1: lmfao
[1:04:51] TirrinWoW: @pixhrlol i would say because its less dependent on positionals/nailing the combo makes it easier to live
[1:04:51] mycho_: Succulent grass man
[1:04:53] Fylerian: most of the superbloom is farming legendary
[1:05:02] Sir_Nikotin: tbh I couldn't make myself to go to the Maw most of the days, but once I got there I kinda had fun
[1:05:06] itsmiraix: are you high?

[1:05:14] kj01a: you're goind it, max! You're roleplaying!!
[1:05:17] ShadowDuelist21: you touched way too much grass
[1:05:18] ThreesFG: Gotta get that R1 Superbloom parse
[1:05:20] YayFiber: love that druids could travel form in the maw then as punishment couldnt travel form this whole expansion
[1:05:22] Aquadriel: low key the dryad next to him is a hottie
[1:05:27] pixhrlol: @pixhrlol ig, and EB is kinda hard to hit on all mobs in big pack
[1:05:28] nilachip: hamster on a wheel
[1:05:29] Onyo1337: tying the legendary into superbloom was so smart, now people will even farm it week 50
[1:05:29] kadashy1: very immersed gaming
[1:05:31] JWallace: the secret gold hand mount was fun to get in the maw
[1:05:32] Artheeri: god superblooms really got me into WoW
[1:05:58] Nox1o: still need 500 more rep
[1:06:01] Nox1o: for the spark
[1:06:01] smolderdaddyuwu: rekt
[1:06:05] freernnur5: spark is frmo the rep one
[1:06:06] Aquadriel: unsparked

[1:06:18] ciggyman: check mate
[1:06:19] kj01a: calculated
[1:06:22] kings4320: except you didnt plant a seed at all lol
[1:06:22] gulliblelion: check
[1:06:22] goombacci: """"planted""""
[1:06:23] itsmiraix: checking
[1:06:24] gulliblelion: mate
[1:06:26] BabyDunn: gotta fill to 50+ dews
[1:06:26] ciggyman: check
[1:06:26] Nox1o: wasnt filled up to half
[1:06:26] Momozzex: KEKW
[1:06:28] obieonee: 250
[1:06:29] litixio: 0
[1:06:29] JakobEll: whys your shit all green?
[1:06:31] kj01a: miscalculated :(
[1:06:31] Korupcija_: 75
[1:06:32] mohscoops: 100?
[1:06:32] smolderdaddyuwu: only purple gives rep now?
[1:06:34] Nox1o: do shipping quest, takes 45sec @Maximum
[1:06:35] othernewname: 150ß
[1:06:35] Line_0: Couple hundred I think
[1:06:42] Nox1o: gives 500
[1:06:42] toastbam: do the shipping stuff
[1:06:42] BiBaButzeBenne: didnt you save the token from last week?
[1:06:43] kadashy1: gotta plant a purp
[1:06:43] oresties: You will get 250 rep guaranteed if the dew drop portion of the seed is at 100 @Maximum
[1:06:46] TattersAU: need 2 seeds at 50% seedin
[1:06:47] mycho_: HUH
[1:06:49] OG_Kawngi: HUH what
[1:06:50] gonzobone: what are all the Ns on your keybinds?
[1:06:51] gretriku: HUH
[1:06:52] Wildfire_Gaming: did you get the seed quest?
[1:06:53] ciggyman: HUH
[1:06:53] N0vaOmega: HUH
[1:06:53] oiye_: 250
[1:06:53] Powzoar: the seed is strong
[1:06:55] Noobysauce: HUH
[1:06:56] SCxFaytal: @Maximum the bags need to be blue for it give rep
[1:06:56] JustDudu: only 5 seeds give rep
[1:06:59] Pellevi: seends need to be at 50%
[1:07:00] Erktraz: o no....
[1:07:01] JustDudu: rest is useless
[1:07:06] Yagr6: this open world shit kinda boring ngl
[1:07:06] SCxFaytal: @Maximum on the right side
[1:07:13] Nox1o: shipping quest is insta 500 rep but ok
[1:07:14] larkhill: imagine not even getting the seed to 50
[1:07:21] gruggee: you are not planting any seeds tho
[1:07:21] juuno106: you gotta click the left one
[1:07:22] rust_80: rust_80 subscribed with Prime. 
[1:07:23] Korupcija_: give your seed to streamer Madge
[1:07:25] juuno106: or it doesnt count
[1:07:31] goombacci: not planting = planting
[1:07:34] MurtagDev: you didnt use a seed lol
[1:07:41] quarantedeux: you need to use a seed
[1:07:42] gonzobone: max learning how to play wow is pretty wholesome content
[1:07:44] quarantedeux: with the left button
[1:07:50] quarantedeux: or you don't get credit
[1:07:51] Wildfire_Gaming: KEKW
[1:07:52] kj01a: seed is the other button
[1:07:54] JWallace: get seed to 50 for rep
[1:07:57] The_Mail_Man__: yooo
[1:08:03] Aquadriel: random chatter is correct
[1:08:07] shea4it: if you take some zinc im pretty sure you get more rep from your seeds
[1:08:14] goombacci: Jebaited we got him
[1:08:18] gruggee: still need 50+ yeah
[1:08:20] Wildfire_Gaming: 50 is enough
[1:08:20] othernewname: u dont need to fill it to 50 ?
[1:08:23] TBouse: getting it full is irrelevant
[1:08:29] JustJoshin____: gotta pull some weeds
[1:08:48] quarantedeux: nah you just need to click the seed on 5 of those
[1:09:03] goombacci: mount PauseChamp
[1:09:14] JWallace: him never taking the question from the little dragon upsets me so much
[1:09:15] sik106: Why do top M+'ers complain that the game is too hard? I dont feel like people understand when you say, "well it is an infinitely scaling game. That is expected." Do they want something like RWF that ends at +30 as the final level?
[1:09:24] daiger5o: HUH
[1:09:28] panser_nes: 50 for rep, 51st for jesus
[1:09:31] kellarXO: firstGarf
[1:09:33] mycho_: firstGarf HOLY
[1:09:33] Bombastius: Ah yes, the content we've been waiting for!
[1:09:34] OG_Kawngi: firstGarf chills
[1:09:39] gmacster_: must be copypasta
[1:09:43] munka_tv: firstGarf
[1:09:43] goombacci: its the way it scales
[1:09:47] Lars_Keizer: firstGarf Actually
[1:09:49] quarantedeux: @sik106 they want to be gated by throughput instead of one shots
[1:09:52] Onyo1337: firstGarf HOLY
[1:09:53] Sover31gn: gard
[1:09:58] munka_tv: cook
[1:09:59] munka_tv: holy
[1:10:01] Korupcija_: M+ needs to change for sure
[1:10:06] OlaF_oo: nope
[1:10:07] Nox1o: that just means that you dont understand the difference between difficulty from scaling and difficutly because every mob has 2 casts
[1:10:11] TheGame402: that's an insane cook
[1:10:22] hothotboxthecar: would that not force a meta comp more?
[1:10:40] goombacci: max you lowkey just cooked
[1:10:44] Aboknes: holy
[1:10:47] Aboknes: thats a great idea
[1:10:48] formation2252: I've said it before, compound scaling needs to go.
[1:10:50] Karkesis: what would the point of that be tho?  Cuz you wouldn't change gameplay at all once you hit the cap, you would just always be going as fast as possible and if you hit the time then that's gg
[1:10:51] goombacci: this is a poddyc discussion stop cooking ons tream
[1:10:53] snarky03: more rewards
[1:10:59] gonzobone: i wish M+ added more mechanics as you hit thresholds rather than adding dumber and dumber affixes
[1:11:01] Varthar: it sucks when one key is bs at 29 and another goes up to 31
[1:11:01] RenegadeHeals: would you rather chain die to oneshots you can barely outplay or lack dps to time the key at some point while not dying?
[1:11:03] kj01a: gg
[1:11:07] nilachip: great gameplay loop
[1:11:12] camcazy: did you time a key eyt
[1:11:14] camcazy: yet
[1:11:16] axstf: Do you have UI available for subs or anything? :)
[1:11:19] m_cell: nah, I love to see the top groups beat the unbeatable dungeons. Thats why I think tgp is way cooler than mdi. Like last one? Where echo has 2 dungeons higher than every other group got it
[1:11:21] menzlo: @maximum isn't it that they want to fail the timer before a mechanic gets silly?
[1:11:26] fronkacean: @axstf look up atrocityUI
[1:11:27] sik106: Like Dorki and Nerf are both saying its too hard because of coordination and stops...but that is just the nature of infinitely scaling. Rather that than impossible to beat 1 shot damage or AOE damage. TY for taking the question Max!
[1:11:39] remli1991: !ui
[1:11:41] LeMike: Having a key not go over +30 requires the key to not be depleted then. So you can keep spamming it over and over to increase timer
[1:11:48] TheGame402: @RenegadeHeals you can squeez out damage and bigger pulls longer than you can outskill oneshots
[1:11:53] Respls: Respls subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 3 months! 
[1:12:01] Nox1o: i feel like people that make the infinite scaling argument dont do high keys
[1:12:10] snarky03: Maybe at the point where people get oneshot is the max key
[1:12:17] Hurbob14: @LeMike true
[1:12:23] LeMike: Make the key not go down 1 key level if you deplete, is what i was trying to say
[1:12:28] Nox1o: @sik106 thats wrong though
[1:12:35] certose: It's in context to other seasons
[1:12:38] menzlo: @maximum if they just buff mob HP but reduce mechanics you'd fail timer
[1:12:52] Hred5: u have more tools compared ot legion thoo
[1:13:00] fronkacean: to be fair if they let the crazy pulls come back, target capping will surely become an issue again
[1:13:04] P4TTYC4KES11: trying to pug afflicted last night was not fun. i could only do one of them on my mage and no one would get the other and we just kept getting haste debuff
[1:13:08] xHinklebobx: they will always pull as much as they can handle anyways tho
[1:13:20] Hitkoxd: waycrest 2nd boss
[1:13:34] xHinklebobx: if keys are getting easier they will make it harder themselves by pulling bigger for example
[1:13:39] kadashy1: I think it just needs to be less deadly and start testing your speed and efficiency more in higher keys. Right now it's literally just go as high as you can until random stuff is one shotting
[1:13:48] certose: Tuning variability is very fuckin hard
[1:13:52] Brobi: @Hred5 Yes, but at a certain point it doesn't matter if you do great DPS, tank great or heal great. All that matters currently is doing the stops correctly
[1:14:08] zachl_: @fronkacean i feel that crazy pull are here and that target capping is an issue for like most of the omega bad target capped specs
[1:14:08] thecajuncommie: you cant fight a trash pack with boss mechanics...like, health and damage is one thing, but 8 mechanics on trash is dumb
[1:14:23] fronkacean: @zachl_ ye i mean some of them feel it
[1:14:27] thecajuncommie: 8 mechanics on a boss is expected, or whatever the amount is
[1:14:35] certose: My tinfoil hat is that they're training us to transcend to the next plain of gamer
[1:14:40] hothotboxthecar: its prio damage that times keys
[1:14:43] hothotboxthecar: not aoe
[1:14:45] certose: Plane*
[1:14:47] Larocca_88: People sometimes talk about liking how back in the day you could wipe twice and still time a key but the reason that exists is because of one shots, if there are no one shots then you time that level and two more levels until the one-shots are there but the timer is much tighter
[1:14:52] goombacci: yeah as someone who used to play hunter....... I know
[1:14:52] Sweets4Life: fire mage
[1:14:53] zachl_: @fronkacean like ik its a outliar but imagine next season how the fuck does a ele shaman play brackenhide or like everbloom or like think of the pad dungeons
[1:14:57] zachl_: kinda unfair imo
[1:14:59] Irruki: @Maximum wanna do 27 brh?
[1:15:03] gonzobone: i'm a lil surprised WW isn't more common in high keys
[1:15:06] cassiahh: dh, mage, boomie, warlock, rogue, aug?
[1:15:16] zoamonk: You do solid damage tanking and healing, do mechanics well, and you time a key, up until you die to mechanics. Doesn't that just mean you've hit the upper end? They have to stop climbing at some point,
[1:15:51] Reluctors: @zachl_ if its pad damage then it doesnt matter
[1:15:52] sik106: ahhhhh okay. I understand what you are saying. Makes sense.  I like the idea of timer lowering at a certain point.
[1:16:03] fronkacean: thoughts on enhance having a talent that made them take 2% more aoe damage? LMAO
[1:16:05] goombacci: people have to be baiting making the same point you just talked against
[1:16:08] menzlo: @maximum couldn't they have just buffed mob HP at beginning of season and timers would be tighter?
[1:16:17] Brobi: @zoamonk The problem, as I see it, is that tanks can tank more, dps can dps more and healers can heal more. However, if one single stop is missed, its a wipe 100% of the time
[1:16:17] certose: If you can keys scaling, you just 100% bring the most utility
[1:16:25] zachl_: @zachl_ i mean ur telling me they can hit 4 little shitter lashers and their main target and thats fair ?
[1:16:27] niightgaming: niightgaming subscribed with Prime. 
[1:16:32] mohscoops: What is your opinion on the pugging system and the people in pugs
[1:16:32] Xyletics: that would legit be fun
[1:16:33] certose: Most utility and dam = win vs most survivability and dam
[1:16:34] Priory: boomkin is tanky?
[1:16:41] Denz_9: no target capped specs would be bis in that system
[1:16:46] JustDudu: @Priory bruh
[1:16:47] quarantedeux: @zoamonk the idea is that you prefer depleting a key by missing the timer because you didn't optimise enough instead of just dying because you ran out of defensives for unavoidable damage
[1:16:50] daiger5o: Io would skyrocket and elitist would multiply
[1:16:56] LeMike: Cap keys to +30, make keys not  able to decrease in keylevel if depleted.  Then you will also see more variation in classes in +30 keys as well
[1:16:56] Reluctors: @zachl_ youre way to worried about overall damage rather than timing the key
[1:16:58] Nox1o: if they do that, then you gotta be able to select a keylevel you wanna do based on highest completed (like D3 grifts) otherwise its just so much fishing
[1:17:01] formation2252: compound scaling issue again. If the dungeons just went up by like 5% / 10% as opposed to 300%
[1:17:02] menzlo: Hakkar
[1:17:03] Varthar: they should stop damage scaling around 25-28 and just scale hp past that
[1:17:23] TattersAU: Should there be boss only affixes?
[1:17:33] TeamLiquid: Break Through Your Game with the new Alienware Pro Wireless Mouse and Keyboard!  go.adv.gg/ar9b1P
[1:17:34] zachl_: @zachl_ no my point is ele can only hit 5 targets and the only real prio they have is main target- they literally in aoe would be doing no effective damage its not about overall
[1:17:41] RurryDiff: i just want my evoker lego agains in season 4
[1:17:51] BigTrout3: what a waste if they don't try something new
[1:17:51] TheGame402: @Varthar that would be the most boring bad experience you can have. No one likes to fight the same stupid pack for 2minutes
[1:17:59] sardow90: same as warrior tho
[1:18:03] sik106: sik106 subscribed at Tier 1. 
[1:18:16] goombacci: no people would still not take classes with less stops
[1:18:19] santalylth: keys need to deplete
[1:18:26] PurpleKami: "homework" keys is the bane of all fun stg
[1:18:29] Powzoar: Speaking of, thoughts on the enw season of D4?
[1:18:29] TheGame402: I would love to have a selection of 3 keys after i time a key to reduce homework keys
[1:18:31] Irruki: what about we get to choose affixs on keys and some affixes that are harder are worth more score?
[1:18:32] gonzobone: i know they say the old dungeons are too basic for M+ but i would love to see top end groups speedrun these old dumb dungeons and see how low the timer can go
[1:18:33] santalylth: otherwise you are just practicing the first pull of a dungeon lol

[1:18:52] menzlo: Dorki said you'd get sick of progging the same pull like tourney realm
[1:18:54] kadashy1: sounds dope to me
[1:18:57] certose: I think having 3 rerolls per week would be nice
[1:18:58] mohscoops: What are your thoughts on the pugging system and the people in them
[1:19:03] BlakeFlair: this is the first time im ever pushing score, doing homework keys is terrible
[1:19:04] goombacci: D3 GR pushing was super fun to me
[1:19:07] santalylth: yea that is not good
[1:19:08] N0vaOmega: Its good the first time
[1:19:08] sdpercussion: appeal to tradition is a logical fallacy
[1:19:09] sweetingsting: you learn a lot from homework keys
[1:19:12] mezzery_: it'd be like progging a raid boss
[1:19:12] JustDudu: Make M+ be doable with Followers as in Followers Dungeons Kappa
[1:19:13] Nox1o: would remove keys entirely
[1:19:23] Brobi: Just imagine practicing a pull for 3 hours
[1:19:24] TheGame402: @Maximum That's why i think getting 3 keys to choose from after you time one would be good. Doesn't remove hoemwork but reduced RNG
[1:19:25] certose: Yeah, that's meh
[1:19:34] professor_cullman: they're afraid not demoting keys will harm the PUG community and remove upward mobility for people I think
[1:19:37] eyeztea: homework keys for us that dont play as much a bad
[1:19:39] ChopperYami: Do keys with random affix when starting x)
[1:19:48] menzlo: Give key 15 minutes cd on deplete
[1:19:49] Irruki: I think the current system makes it really really hard to try things without a huge down side.
[1:19:51] smooth1forever: tgp is so much better than mdi
[1:19:54] 1tsmeMcV: Make keys have 2 or 3 dungeons per key. so your +18, has ToT, DHT and WM
[1:19:54] Denz_9: the instance limit timer would cap that somewhat @Maximum
[1:19:57] VRVento: just give them charges @maximum new keys has 3 attempts to time
[1:20:00] sdpercussion: the trade off is you can't skip keys
[1:20:03] MysticalOS: maybe a reset timer?
[1:20:05] MizzySRK: hey chat, as a new player who isnt 70 yet. what is the point of doing higher keys? is it gear rewards?
[1:20:09] sdpercussion: you have to do it on 25 before you can do 26
[1:20:11] MysticalOS: so you arent encouraged to spam it
[1:20:14] goblingher: I dont subscribe to that, people are allowed to dictate their own time, doing mdi style is not time efficent to fill vault. Let ppl waste time if they wanna
[1:20:15] zachl_: @MizzySRK status and io score
[1:20:15] MrScottyMac: no depletes, make the key drops still random, preserve reroll system as is, but make the level of the key equal to the max you've done as the key holder.
[1:20:23] syzurup: hey max, when are fyrakk nerfs, my guild stinks!
[1:20:28] quarantedeux: over a full season it'll be awful
[1:20:30] mohscoops: What are your thoughts on Pugging sytem and the players in pugs
[1:20:33] Nox1o: could also be fun to pug higher, you just do a random 26 and it goes well, at the end you just ask if they wanna blast 27. Everyone knows the route, group was good
[1:20:34] Nox1o: just blast
[1:20:35] Irruki: there should be way to practice keys before sending it
[1:20:36] malnourish_: LOL
[1:20:37] shale93: oh nice title, you really doing 72 hours stream?
[1:20:38] gonzobone: i mostly just wish they had more than 8 dungeons each season i'd love it to be more like diablo with a million options

[1:31:39] othernewname: HAH
[1:31:43] rangermonk: Not a drill!
[1:31:51] Adrang: @sdpercussion in that way though, the scaling went up, not down
[1:31:58] BlayzeRM: @misran they even made the scaling harder than SLANDs
[1:32:03] TheGame402: @shale93 in throne it's always the easy parts that get the group. I don't think i depleted one to a hard mechanic yet but so many to really stupid stun rotation shit or 200% increased darkness damage AOEs
[1:32:09] dalerp69: @thecajuncommie its honestly does it bother you less or more than shaving does, because i have a beard because i don't want to shave
[1:32:12] smolderdaddyuwu: amen!

[1:32:30] splashz0r: i honestly wish i could be baby face assassin no hair on face forever KEKW
[1:32:32] chasen218: @Maximum  question :- What is the class that 100% u will never play it
[1:32:34] sdpercussion: Ya its just wild to see people doing 26 no healer keys, after my last time playing things got hard around 17s
[1:32:34] Nox1o: beards itch the significant other more than the owner
[1:32:37] gonzobone: trimming a beard is way more annoying than shaving imo
[1:32:42] theUGOTUGOT: doesnt feel the same for everyone...
[1:32:43] eisen_rs: i think its usually a symptom of bad skin under the beard.
[1:32:44] amazadin: i get really bad beardruff - shampoo and oil help for sure
[1:32:46] amazadin: but winter time is rough
[1:32:47] Keyvi_: beard oil is only for the skin beneath the beard
[1:32:49] malnourish_: gotta lather on that Dapper Dan
[1:32:51] othernewname: monkaW
[1:32:54] Voyburke: Thats the worst part, its the handlebar part that always ends up as part of my meal
[1:32:57] mezzery_: depends on if you get dandruff in your beard or not
[1:32:57] sdpercussion: @Maximum Beard oil is for skin not hear. your face doesn't produce enough oil
[1:32:59] Rampo123: wtf is that weakura scream
[1:33:00] vilfork: some people are beard care people, and it shows
[1:33:02] sdpercussion: unlike scaplp
[1:33:02] blazionboiii: beards itch when you have shit skin, or sweaty/oily skin, thats what beard oil does, regulates the natural oil in your skin/hair follicles :)
[1:33:03] gunshinsora: @Keyvi_ i see i see
[1:33:04] internetuser97: this spec is legit adhd
[1:33:05] N1xern: Technically beards don't itch, but the skin under it will start to itch if it lacks moisture
[1:33:05] BabyDunn: wilhelm scream ftw
[1:33:07] Asynoel: most people using beard oil have way too short beards for it. beard oil is supposed to keep the skin moisturized below a longer beard, if you only have stubble it's just gonna give you oily skin
[1:33:07] Nays4: wtf
[1:33:07] malnourish_: beard oil good for weed smokers
[1:33:08] KaisenSiru: AAAA
[1:33:08] Spaxis90: as an SO of a beard wearer, its weird when he shaves it off
[1:33:17] Confused95_: bruh :D
[1:33:18] thecajuncommie: @dalerp69 I mean, this is my life, yeah I basically shave(never with razor but like trimmer) once every two months? but not because I want to, but I cant stand my beard being this long, but im told its a phase
[1:33:20] misran: maximizing bolstering xdd
[1:33:20] Hush_Or_Howl: Just shampoo mine when i wash my hair never had it itch or anything tbh
[1:33:21] smolderdaddyuwu: beards only itch once you start growing them. I'd say 2-3 months it'll stop.
[1:33:22] othernewname: monkaW
[1:33:22] RivotrilJackson: !uptime
[1:33:24] Masterkdz: Imagine all these little slimes giving Bolster, you'd be having leviathan class dragons
[1:33:27] DakotaPelana: the fuck is that
[1:33:27] lumaday: that is certainly a sound
[1:33:42] thecajuncommie: @thecajuncommie I never have been able to get through it and I just trim it all
[1:33:42] Spaxis90: he knows :D
[1:33:43] shale93: @TheGame402 yeah it was always tank dying to trash or pulling like absolute monkey in the 2nd room, the amount of keys that ended before even reaching the 1st boss is funny lol
[1:33:51] gunshinsora: i haven't shaved my beard off in  5years would feel too weird just trim
[1:33:52] goblingher: Never heard of the wilhelm scream?
[1:33:55] Nemoriel: You favour bigwigs or dbm ?
[1:33:56] Nulter: beard oil if ur beard feels like poobs

[1:34:05] Centias: and the dogs in the Waycrest courtyard
[1:34:10] Confused95_: @Masterkdz that would be so fn funny. Wasnt that the case first boss room plaguefall in SL? the little slimes?
[1:34:12] Nox1o: you soaked a circle in that puddle
[1:34:15] Nox1o: thats why
[1:34:15] thecajuncommie: this rogue is murdering
[1:34:19] goombacci: @its_Zenni I assume customized plater
[1:34:24] Nays4: imagine if every beard hair you shaved away bolstered a mob
[1:34:25] Nox1o: you dont meld in p1
[1:34:31] Zircons: because phase 1
[1:34:32] Inenta: Why shadowmeld p1 doe
[1:34:44] Masterkdz: yeah, and what about these freaking horrible flowers in eb :'(
[1:34:59] blazionboiii: @Nays4 it bolsters the nose hairs

[1:35:25] mmcdermid: mmcdermid subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 4 months! 
[1:35:39] Nays4: wait bald people always have beards so shaving your head bolsters your bear hair @blazionboiii

[1:36:12] Ionized4: unethical
[1:36:15] AJbgodx: ngl bro I just clicked stream and thought it was serious KEKW

[1:36:43] snarky03: Yes is the answer
[1:36:44] gonzobone: max desperate to get bolstered
[1:36:47] AJbgodx: Poggg

[1:36:49] Adrang: spinny murder
[1:36:52] leubinator: 20s with pugs are harder than 23s with pugs

[1:36:57] mycho_: Rap god
[1:36:59] sdpercussion: don't worry and AD will cover
[1:37:04] Rakim88: dont bully the tank on his route
[1:37:05] JackOfAllApocalypses: it's just a long way to walk
[1:37:13] Nays4: @BriFi999 makes sense. I would be awful bald then because i cant grow a beard
[1:37:22] Yanko22: dont u wanna add more versa to your gear ?
[1:37:25] lshowmakerl: maybe because hes scared of bolstering
[1:37:27] ColdIceCreamMan: why even pull when you have shroud lul

[1:38:00] smolderdaddyuwu: bronze dragon. choose the form a gnome. and does yellow dragon time stuff.
[1:38:04] risettefreya: what I don’t get about the ethics of streaming is why the tank/dps/healer don’t get paid now, cause they honestly are the reason this key exists and a lot of moments
[1:38:05] ArcaneSyntax: Chromie is a time dragon
[1:38:06] sardow90: shes old lol

[1:38:32] Nays4: Chromie is a dragon
[1:38:40] Melancholy_Mode: @mrcreatine123 Chromies dragon name follows the male naming convention for bronze dragons
[1:38:47] patti221: Chromie is  male dragon but chose a female gnome form.
[1:38:48] Adrang: how much faster than 12 min are you looking for?

[1:39:21] RumPilot: @noises90 Chromie is a girl what are you on about.
[1:39:25] rust_80: She was playing a big deal in original Culling of Strat dungeon during the wotlk, that the first time i remember cromie in the story

[2:12:53] rust_80: There is one more quest in the enerald dream you haven't done, where you need to plant 5 seeds, it also has a chance to give you spark, but it is heavy rng...
[2:12:53] Humantelope: You specifically aren't able to max. Game just doesn't like you getting amz nerfed years ago still

[2:13:00] othernewname: sounds true, it has capitalized words in it
[2:13:00] Camelbak21: dream wardens 1.5k rep quest gives one guaranteed
[2:13:02] SovexFFXIV: xdding chat is always right unless it's not
[2:13:02] SangheliosWoW: If the half spark you got is from the quest then you can loot one from these bosses
[2:13:04] Raggu2: well, tahts just false UNLESS you also include, "and have never missed a week"

[2:13:27] sUb2_w9nDeR: For any characters that fall behind on Spark creation, extra Splintered Spark of Dreams 37 has a chance to drop from various sources, like Raids and Mythic+ dungeons, until the character is caught up.
[2:13:29] Simmpleton: @Maximum You can't look one if you haven't done the quest in the emerald dreamp camp where you turn in one half spark for 2
[2:13:30] oresties: @Maximum Hunt makes a noise it's just not the same one
[2:13:32] malnourish_: guy in chat right, but only if he was caught up
[2:13:33] IkuyaGB: Chat is never wrong Kappa

[2:14:33] heisunknown: well how are you dumping
[2:14:35] OG_Kawngi: huge dumps
[2:14:35] Zarroe: xdd
[2:14:36] Teraava: As I understand it, if you have gotten the spark from the weekly quest every week, then you're not eligible to get another spark from other content.
[2:14:39] BabyDunn: gotta say you are bricked up
[2:14:44] Nox1o: you should answer, "whats dps"?
[2:14:52] kevdeckie: did you get PI and ebon might on that one?
[2:14:53] goombacci: dont tell him about how augs work either
[2:14:55] mojar88: you had ebon might the whole time lol

[2:17:19] nellfin: the other boots kinda crank
[2:17:21] Cakerinotv: baseg
[2:17:21] heisunknown: they might have, just not near you
[2:17:22] Raggu2: Chat, if hes done the weekly and is still under the total available he *could* have looted it can come from any eligible source.
[2:17:24] joecitoo: augment rune
[2:17:27] ciggyman: THIS MEANS WAR IRS

[2:18:20] Azkrust: I now know who not to watch. thanks Sigris!
[2:18:24] Biscuitpaw: max is definitely capped and not getting a spark right? Like, he does enough content, there's no way he's behind cap
[2:18:26] Skojin897: never turn down a pi
[2:18:34] Team_Spanky: @Maximum did you see Shamans got a buff? They fixed a talent that caused them to take more damage instead of less!
[2:18:40] 0_____Kappa: Clueless
[2:18:43] m_dep: if it was timed well then everyone else would be frustrated and you'd be happy. With it being poorly timed everyone is frustrated. It's only fair.
[2:18:51] Raggu2: @Biscuitpaw that would be my assumption. but he seems adamant hes not.
[2:18:58] Spinerek: @Biscuitpaw not if he didnt do rep quest last week

[2:19:33] bradlockk: ya i used vengeful retreat on my warlock
[2:19:33] Celynae: Our warrior walked out of it natty mid-prog tonight, mythic raider btw
[2:19:34] lessahj: Is this, a Mythic pug?
[2:19:36] Raggu2: @Spinerek taht isnt how that works. Only the most recent spark IF you havent done the weekly in that week, is locked behind the weekly.
[2:19:39] corebitz: Fyralaths on use got me one time on that
[2:20:03] Sover31gn: Piss vaping right here

[2:21:36] timmayb166: resto druid
[2:21:36] GrimFandango: No way, the Damage to Bosses all 3 mage specs are still like bottom 1/3rd at 95th percentile
[2:21:38] saladbar19: over what class
[2:21:43] Wincrediboy: 1 of each spec! gotta catch em all
[2:21:45] GrimFandango: Mayyyybe you'd run 2 Frost for Tindral
[2:21:51] IkuyaGB: What would you replace for 3rd rogue?
[2:21:59] goombacci: @BabyDunn considering max is getting PI he kinda did get beat

[2:23:27] GrimFandango: 409 is good enough YEP
[2:23:28] BabyDunn: just do 80 keys
[2:23:29] fdb33: RMT max ez $
[2:23:31] Team_Spanky: @Maximum did you see the Shaman buffs? They fixed a Talent that instead of causing shamans to take less damage, it caused them tot take more
[2:23:33] 7fpz: whats swiping?
[2:23:35] Darklott: but max its only 900 thats only like 70 keys before you can play
[2:23:37] Basic_3: You're so addled with streamer privilege.
[2:23:37] Raggu2: Just call up Ion
[2:23:39] Czeski_33: I hear you can buy "raid ready"
[2:23:39] 7fpz: liekscam swping or wym
[2:23:42] ciggyman: y not let chat help
[2:23:42] Cakerinotv: Yeah that's my 1 gripe with the current gearing, crests suck ASS right now tyring to gear 1000 crests fora n alt
[2:23:46] TheCJrose1234: paying money @7fpz
[2:23:47] Brohdin: Just get the raid ready boost KEKW
[2:23:50] DutchGameLab: dont tell Blizzard monkaW
[2:23:52] Rampo123: wtf
[2:23:55] 7fpz: @TheCJrose1234 ahh
[2:23:55] Nox1o: its like 12 hours of giga blasting i think
[2:23:56] Rampo123: stealing guild bank
[2:23:57] TyHeals: Why is conquest uncapped and extra conquest but no extra PVE crests
[2:23:59] Qubuuuu: yoink
[2:24:01] sealteamsesh: Just get a viewer raid going and full gear it in a day EZ
[2:24:02] NotDage: just buy boe
[2:24:02] BabyDunn: embezzlement classic
[2:24:04] NotDage: holy
[2:24:06] emperorkittens: i really wish they just allowed yout o have gear on your alts after a few months/hit a threshhold on gear on main
[2:24:07] onlyxanz: EZ
[2:24:08] Juanzary: Didnt we give feedback in s1 for crests already ? Still we cant send over.. But hey, warwithin changes EVERYTHING... Madge
[2:24:09] Raggu2: gearing is perhaps the fastest its ever been. no gripes on wanting it to be faster.
[2:24:09] sealteamsesh: Like the rest of us do
[2:24:12] Thejokerkid: Boys what's crests?
[2:24:16] NotDage: avoidance mythic track easy
[2:24:17] corebitz: Why not promote Horseboy so you dont have to do that again?
[2:24:19] KiwiGuy17: @Maximum  IRD has been notififed!
[2:24:21] stRikesattack: Just curious when the race isn't going on does liquid still raid as a guild? kinda new to wow
[2:24:23] mybootyisasnack: just use your gm power and get some carries
[2:24:27] Jemba: shame its not making it to next season
[2:24:29] TBouse: per day he must mean
[2:24:30] Denekyy: u can just raid with viewers and get all loot spoonfed to you no ? @Maximum
[2:24:33] goombacci: @Thejokerkid currency to upgrade gear
[2:24:35] GrimFandango: @sealteamsesh Viewer Raids don't get you the last 50+ Aspect Crests you need to get everything Hero maxxed
[2:24:37] Juanzary: @Thejokerkid pain and agony
[2:24:45] Wincrediboy: how much effort would you be happy with to gear up an alt? it's easier than ever before isn't it
[2:24:49] Basic_3: @stRikesattack Yes, they do carries and sell runs to bankroll gold for future raids
[2:24:52] Nox1o: for aspects id guess you need about 600, thats 50 keys, 15min a key is 12.5 hrs, no wyrm included though
[2:24:53] emperorkittens: i geared my monk and it took me as a solo player 30 in game hours to get to 480
[2:24:59] Brandonko13: 12hours = 24+ keys = 288 crests
[2:25:09] awesomeoohh: @Maximum what was the first tier you started raid leading out of game
[2:25:10] Jemba: HAH
[2:25:10] illusion1990: gear is irrelevant at this point. The "grind" isnt a thing anymore nor does dumping time into this game make you feel stronger. At least on the high end. Everyone knows how each class is and has played so gearing is a waste of time. If you know how to play you beat 99% of the playerbase
[2:25:12] Brohdin: You have to do a profession
[2:25:13] corebitz: do you have progessions?
[2:25:13] kyleconfirm: HAH

[2:25:24] thoromyr19: theres a quest guy near you that gives you 150
[2:25:25] Thejokerkid: @goombacci I that's the flight stones and you just get the other thing like everything you do something, you need a 1000 of thoses things?
[2:25:25] Craptakular: rather than recraft
[2:25:25] thoromyr19: on a bench
[2:25:28] healapotamus: just tip a bit more
[2:25:33] reggiepowa: xddShrug
[2:25:33] corebitz: Oh they can i lied
[2:25:33] Raggu2: its only 5 like nothing. The weekly gives 150
[2:25:37] Nox1o: @Brandonko13 except that a key takes 15min not 30, yeah
[2:25:37] TirrinWoW: @Nox1o id love to see you rip 50 keys in 12 hours to demonstrate
[2:25:44] wet_noodle_fight: 🦟
[2:25:55] Flipeled: you have to spend spark to recraft
[2:25:58] Denekyy: looking at ur inventory makes me sick to my stomach max
[2:26:00] KWIKguy: do you have any dragon shards get a shit ton of mettle from those
[2:26:01] Sover31gn: xddTree
[2:26:02] Rampo123: @Maximum guy on bench talk to him
[2:26:02] Nox1o: @Nox1o im sure max could get a giga blaster group that perma runs 16s
[2:26:03] goombacci: @Thejokerkid yes pretty much all pve content; the harder the content the better the crests you get and the better gear you can upgrade
[2:26:11] BabyDunn: @Flipeled no u dont only for going from s2 to s3 craft
[2:26:13] seamuscg: throwing up irl looking at your inventory
[2:26:14] sintoxtoo: watching you lose your train of thought looking in your bags in real time gave me life

[2:26:38] ashelfal: wasnt 10.2.6 supposed to hit PTR today?
[2:26:41] Rampo123: idk why u even need to send a crafting order instead of just buying the crest
[2:26:47] Rampo123: crafters= scammers
[2:26:51] Aro725: its ass
[2:26:53] Karkesis: I like it :)
[2:26:57] CoffeeASAP: I love crafting in gw2 but it's awful here lol

[2:26:57] m_dep: Its better than it was before DF, but def still needs some work
[2:26:58] mybootyisasnack: its funny how many people will spam you offering to do stuff like this for 20k lol
[2:26:58] Juanzary: Its ass
[2:27:00] TyHeals: Crafting is fun, doing all the fucking math sucks
[2:27:01] TheCJrose1234: its way better than it used to be

[2:27:09] leubinator: i love getting scammed on recrafts
[2:27:10] Ghand0ur: You should get auctinator addon. Helps with buying these stuff quickly
[2:27:12] herso_: the crafting it self is meh, its what we get thats nice about it lol

[2:28:34] leubinator: buying mats without auctioner is psychopath behaviour
[2:28:36] Wikedlyrics: m_dep they ain't gonna avoid it if commission is more than mat cost which is what he was saying

[2:28:40] itscharlas: I've not had someone avoid it. just pay like 2x the mat cost and tip

[3:16:53] Bellissimo__: All I can see is Michael Scott

[3:16:57] GrimFandango: @toastie_wow real gamer hours in here, gj
[3:16:58] Nezapadookie: What kinda carbs you getting tonight?
[3:16:58] Ghand0ur: You dont have to do keys though :D You can waste time doing other things
[3:17:00] CptPinkeye: Beer = carbs, easier to drink than eat.. seems logical to me.
[3:17:10] lancepally: what position are you  in hockey. defense is best obviously
[3:17:23] lezugg: @Maximum You should do a viewer rat push for content and just see how high u can go with absolute rats lol
[3:17:23] tkl47: go eu iguess
[3:17:31] baseboned: what are the affixes next tyran, I dont want to play afflicted bolstering
[3:17:31] Elioss: Ele sham pumping, imagine if they didnt kill the spec every patch
[3:17:39] Gloriance: I would like to see an Everbloom attempt
[3:17:39] kingpeace09: sanguine incorp next week

[3:19:09] Gloriance: Sweet. I will be here for that!
[3:19:10] nyshindysheen: EB +32 tomorrow?
[3:19:17] brolafstroll: how much uptime on bsl did you have in your last run? @Maximum
[3:19:18] Korupcija_: what is worse slice and dice or momentum
[3:19:18] Denekyy: How did you like BSL this key?
[3:20:27] Esperanzo435: @Maximum don't you think you should press throw glaive manually to get to 0 charges and then blade dance to have more hunts ?
[3:20:54] toastie_wow: with that build I should do like 19M ... ish
[3:21:02] dan00h: ty! @Maximum
[3:21:06] m_dep: no ragefire probably saved the day
[3:21:09] Lenzoface: MONKASTEER
[3:21:09] Arauthor: blame my team and ragequit
[3:21:26] bigpharma___: ^
[3:21:32] Zarroe: you can blade dance like every other gcd
[3:21:37] Lenzoface: I would go out of the bubble, die and blame the healer
[3:21:58] Syndera: does lust and shield buff allow for dance spam only?
[3:22:01] l00s3c4nn0n: no
[3:22:06] Syndera: thought they didnt stack
[3:22:21] Esperanzo435: Blade dance still throws a glaive with 0 chrages
[3:22:22] Esperanzo435: It does
[3:22:26] Esperanzo435: it 100% does
[3:22:35] maevs63: its rng
[3:22:35] jsimx: i was under the impression it throws a glaive
[3:22:38] maevs63: its not 100%
[3:22:40] l00s3c4nn0n: no it doesnt'
[3:22:40] fdb33: can we go check on dummies?
[3:22:44] Esperanzo435: yeah yeah
[3:22:49] LPKproductions: thats not the full dmg one
[3:22:57] Laungs: it throws the tier glaive only
[3:22:58] LPKproductions: yeah its only the 35% one
[3:23:08] Esperanzo435: no but it still reduces hunt CD
[3:23:28] FloatNg: but charges dont matter then lmfao
[3:23:36] Laungs: yes, it is, but there is only a slight change
[3:23:42] fdb33: ya but it does that rwithout using the global so it frees u upo to use it on something else
[3:24:40] kumar1191: did we time the fall?
[3:24:55] Esperanzo435: try using hunt first
[3:24:58] thetiss_: it does throw but for 35%
[3:25:14] Slapsstick: CDR
[3:25:21] FloatNg: we know it gives cdr
[3:25:23] getoogwayed: hey @Maximum what do you think about if a guild just gets to nerfed tindral after smolderon, how many pulls should they kill it in average?
[3:25:26] lethal1ty: check throwglaive casts from details?
[3:25:27] redapples28: could you take the tier pieces off?
[3:25:27] Wincrediboy: take off tier for the test?
[3:25:36] GrimFandango: @getoogwayed probably 7
[3:25:39] boxxn: yo
[3:25:49] cbodx10: It always throws the extra glaive just less dmg
[3:26:02] mokaba_: its the 35% proc, it  won't do the full throw glaive if you have no charges. The entire point of it was to make it so you didn't have to constantly press TG which feels bad
[3:26:10] cbodx10: if you have charge its 100%
[3:26:13] cbodx10: if not 30
[3:26:36] cbodx10: correct
[3:26:42] thetiss_: yes
[3:26:45] cbodx10: you save GCD tho
[3:27:02] Laungs: check recount data on spell usage @maximum
[3:27:22] Vazov2: doing it in m+ gives quite noticable cdr to the hunt btw
[3:27:26] Esperanzo435: it did
[3:27:48] getoogwayed: hey @Maximum what do you think about if a guild just gets to nerfed tindral after smolderon, how many pulls should they kill it in average?
[3:27:50] iloveuminkey: cmon
[3:27:51] LPKproductions: yeah im still not doing that
[3:27:52] Vazov2: and soulscar becomes topdmg for st
[3:27:52] Esperanzo435: i was just wondering if it was using throw glaive overall
[3:27:52] Darklott: just pretend you didnt see it
[3:27:59] rangermonk: switch to dk :P
[3:28:01] heffashep: garf  time to play monk
[3:28:05] cbodx10: but you can normally have an extra throw glaive every 2nd bd due to cd
[3:28:05] Esperanzo435: was worth it *
[3:28:08] Slapsstick: does the 35% have a chance of triggering on every hit of each slash? or is it the slash itself
[3:28:33] iloveuminkey: garf
[3:29:00] Laungs: why dont we just check how many times glaive throw was casted in on the recount/skada addon?
[3:29:10] cbodx10: Damage loss unless you get hunt back fast enough
[3:29:14] Vazov2: the noticable dmg for st is soulscar and for aoe is like a few more the hunts throught the dungeon
[3:29:16] cbodx10: pros and cons
[3:29:17] Korupcija_: they should give DH a range spec
[3:29:22] BabyDunn: does it fuck with timings though with EB?
[3:30:01] cbodx10: Serrated glaives though
[3:30:09] Esperanzo435: i believe it might be worth it on downtime windos
[3:30:12] lacosess: how can i make my talents transparent like this? :0
[3:30:24] Rhoncer: you press it when slightly out of melee
[3:30:40] headninja1ncharge: No cap
[3:30:41] hyruliaa: you have a quest following you
[3:30:44] Eredae23: ever since i played retail in 2020, DH has had the best community regarding how to make the class good
[3:30:45] cbodx10: Unless were talking about m+  trash
[3:30:50] Kourk: @Korupcija_ DH range support spec? new aug XD
[3:30:51] Vazov2: its only worth it without meta
[3:30:57] Esperanzo435: yeah if the hunt isn't on CD it's pointless
[3:30:59] Vazov2: i've done a bunch of dungeonw tih it
[3:31:12] gambleragain: imagine that pet irl
[3:31:15] gambleragain: QUESTION MARK QUESTION MARK
[3:31:26] Vazov2: for aoe
[3:31:32] Korupcija_: @Kourk eww
[3:31:32] Vazov2: its way more worth it, than 1 extra cs
[3:31:49] stelfbronco: @maximum what class are you going to play next tier?
[3:31:56] Vazov2: getting soulscar on up to 7-8 targets which is big worth
[3:31:56] baseboned: max do the azeroth archive intro quests I would love to hear your thoughts on it, its at algathar academy
[3:32:08] Poozer21: @lacosess its an addon called talent tree tweaks. its a nice QOL addon
[3:32:26] getoogwayed: hey @Maximum what do you think about if a guild just gets to nerfed tindral after smolderon, how many pulls should they kill it in average?
[3:32:31] Vazov2: gngn
