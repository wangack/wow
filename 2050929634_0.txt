[0:35:00] kuuple_boople: @TaliesinAndEvitel is THIS the month you finish Endwalker? o.o
[0:35:26] databob1: @taliesinandevitel  I have a vulpiren monk named Taleiesin and my wife has a vulpiren hunter named Evitale we did trading post last night and are now rocking the pink witch gear
[0:35:34] neverbornlucky: Taliesin you wouldn't ask garret about High chairs
[0:35:39] thunduz: dude that podcast was so good! yesterday was a day to say the least so the podcast was a nice distraction
[0:35:42] HSAyril: I got it on week 3 this season, it's kinda underwhelming tneTaliCry
[0:36:04] thunduz: Evi was for sure tempted by garrett to return lol
[0:36:04] Nimsh: garret has amazing hair, he's like some modern day cavalier
[0:36:05] witchhobbit: that episode was fantastic
[0:36:07] Nimsh: Choo Chooo RPGGhosto
[0:36:14] thunduz: RETURN FOR THE KITCHEN

[0:36:35] thunduz: ff14 joke
[0:36:36] Rhys_Velaris: The Lala lifters
[0:36:45] netonkent: Tali I've always got more tendies than I need but got 0 cause of this month. I blame Johanna for making everything pink haha
[0:36:48] neverbornlucky: Taliesin in final fantasy they had drama over high chairs the baby race
[0:37:24] HSAyril: In contrast, there's almost nothing I want this month for I'll be saving my tendies
[0:37:30] thunduz: did you see Peptp responded to someone joking about the pink Tmog lol
[0:37:31] neverbornlucky: it was the player housing chair they went burn the game down mode of it
[0:37:37] thunduz: Pepto*
[0:37:48] nadiaaa: i will purchase any magical girl items immediately and i regret nothing
[0:38:01] whisperlude: i completely agree
[0:38:14] crazidaizi: @nadiaaa I'm with you!
[0:38:16] Arlaeya: there are reaction to reaction to reaction streamers now
[0:38:18] darth_nykal: they just steal content
[0:38:18] corpas_: reaction videos are just there for people whose opinion depends on a youtube video
[0:38:24] nadiaaa: @crazidaizi lets gooo <3
[0:38:35] ancester: @TaliesinAndEvitel typical reaction stream with a shocked face thumbnail
[0:38:40] databob1: I'm not a huge fan of pink but I couldn't say no to dressing up like a sailor scout
[0:38:53] neverbornlucky: Taliesin what did ASMONGOLD touch now
[0:39:10] Nulgar: @Arlaeya to be fair, that is less bad, or not bad at all, since they're not stealing actual content maybep7Hehe
[0:39:11] Deatheran: @TaliesinAndEvitel i think there is deffenitly a spectrum of them. some who put the stuff on and go make a sandwitch, others who turn a 20 minute video into a 7 hour stream. one is not like the other
[0:39:18] TenWin: @TaliesinAndEvitel  Most of the reaction streamers is the most boring and poorly done possible. Reaction streamers only really work (IMO) when the person in question is super passioante for whatever they are reacting to. But the issue is that reaction streamers just watch... everything, resulting in poor and half-assed content that isn't transformative enough or even itneresting enough rather just becoming middle consumer eh?
[0:39:23] crazidaizi: @nadiaaa need to start playing again to earn tendies
[0:39:26] thunduz: but why?
[0:39:51] TenWin: @TaliesinAndEvitel Hey, a bit of a benefit... No tendies in the pack.
[0:39:55] databob1: Blizzard was doing that stuff before the merger was even a thought
[0:39:56] ebrahim_91: I am back, but Tali I was first on your stream today ! Finally got notified, and I love u both so so so sooooooo much
[0:40:01] neverbornlucky: Taliesin NAME asmongold
[0:40:13] Nulgar: some streamers turn on the stream, then go take a dump for 20 minutes tneTali
[0:40:30] crazidaizi: or eat hobnobs
[0:40:37] databob1: I really like legal eagle
[0:40:49] WolandMS: Love Legal Eagle!
[0:40:52] CeasiusPls: tbf youtube can solve this problem the same way they did with using copyrighted music with shorts
[0:40:53] HSAyril: Free content, they don't have actually make anything
[0:41:05] Sch1ey: Thats the part i dont like. i get reacting with chat changes it a lot even if the streamer isnt doing a lot
[0:41:19] nadiaaa: I watch them!
[0:41:37] KhrysW: Lol I belive I've seen them all
[0:41:45] Vinapocalypse: 10s to 100s of K = nobody 🤨
[0:41:50] gametimechumps: gametimechumps subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 47 months! Happy Groundhog Day!
[0:42:02] Deatheran: or add transformative content / perspective ofc
[0:42:05] ebrahim_91: I enjoyed Iridikron vs he who shal not be named
[0:42:34] neverbornlucky: Asmongold
[0:42:36] Reminii91: hey talisein, is it finally PIRATE time?
[0:42:38] witchhobbit: yeah it's so bad
[0:42:45] TenWin: @TaliesinAndEvitel Most of the reaction streamers is the most boring and poorly done possible. Reaction streamers only really work (IMO) when the person in question is super passioante for whatever they are reacting to. But the issue is that reaction streamers just watch... everything, resulting in poor and half-assed content that isn't transformative enough or even itneresting enough rather just becoming middle consumer eh?
[0:42:55] ItsDJDW: ahoy!
[0:43:02] ShadowDragon14855: morning all
[0:43:16] Nulgar: I've searched for uploads of movies to YT, instead I found "reviews" of the movie that looked like the actual movie by the title and thumb
[0:43:24] Reminii91: who are we talking about now chat? just got in...
[0:43:25] thunduz: 
[0:43:34] databob1: Oh Phil is predicting an early spring
[0:43:43] neverbornlucky: we know asmongold goal is a bag of shit Taliesin
[0:43:44] crazidaizi: plagiarism kind of
[0:43:57] mattyxoqt: why do people care about people reaction?
[0:44:33] CeasiusPls: Could youtube just not solve it by counting reaction views as views to the original?
[0:44:34] nadiaaa: I like watching reaction videos like "composer reacts to wow music" because they have a lot of technical knowledge that I dont
[0:44:35] SquiggySquonk: I searched for videos, either trailers for games, or for content from a content creator, and I often get reaction videos in the top results rather than the video itself.
[0:44:42] thunduz: I care about Tali's input and reaction to things. I just want to geek out with a buddy lol
[0:44:45] BigD530: so xQc pulling a SSSniperwolf scam?
[0:44:51] JarJar_Brinkz: I remember people were so scared of fair use when using like 10 second clips. Now we're getting full blown reaction videos LUL
[0:45:10] TenWin: @BigD530 Well, except the doxxing.
[0:45:26] Rem_peepo: A lot of "react" youtubers just watch the video and barely say anything. Like a 20min video and the react video is 23minutes. Proper reaction videos is transformative and extend the video with their own thoughts and opinions
[0:45:33] Triz84: Didnt hbomberguy do a whole plagiarism video about it?
[0:45:52] ancester: How old are your kids rn Tali?
[0:45:53] corpas_: that guy who makes the "opera singer reacts to" videos is genuinely amazing
[0:45:55] alextheblight: "yeah"
[0:45:56] gachimane_: I saw Hasans editor just put a random video of him sitting their when he would get up to go to the bathroom while the video would play , smh
[0:45:57] alextheblight: "true"
[0:46:07] thunduz: on this topic I legit am curious about your reaction to the new Netflix trailer to Live Action Avatar the Last Airbender
[0:46:20] Vinapocalypse: eyyy same!
[0:46:30] CeasiusPls: I don't see how this problem couldn't be solved by youtube
[0:46:35] JarJar_Brinkz: Birthday month!
[0:46:36] Vinapocalypse: Happy birthday to the Aquariuses!
[0:46:38] ancester: taurus gang
[0:46:41] Sampy104: oh, I thought we meant the stuff chemistry teachers post on YouTube. Those kind of reaction videos
[0:46:44] TenWin: @TaliesinAndEvitel I would also say that reaction videos / streams focusing on "official" content is fine. Like reacting to anime openings, or cartoon episodes, etc etc.
[0:46:56] R0ndras: People forget that fair use values the impact on the original creator and its material.  If XQC does a reaction video and he gets 5 million views, but the original content is still at 20k.  Thats not fair use.
[0:46:56] ancester: oh wait yeah aquarius
[0:47:02] darth_nykal: @thunduz I really dislike how they're changing Sokka
[0:47:31] JarJar_Brinkz: Is that TOS? Kappa
[0:47:36] gsrasslan: As an AuDHD'er: when where you diagnosed, and why was it in your 20's?
[0:47:59] Sampy104: What if YouTube had some official reaction feature where it would credit the original video and maybe share money?
[0:48:20] R0ndras: @Sampy104 that would require youtube to care about its plattform and creators
[0:48:20] KaisenSiru: triRead
[0:48:34] neverbornlucky: Taliesin that ok pokemon fans already sending death threats to palworld devs we knew it was coming
[0:48:59] DozlaT: i wonder if yotube could just do that where you put the person you're reacting to get some of the revenue from the reactors side
[0:49:01] DevoidX: reaction videos are lazy content and I personally won't watch youtube videos of that nature
[0:49:03] RileyDoodles_: that would be a nice solution
[0:49:14] Sampy104: We just have to trick YouTube. Tell them it’s a TikTok remix feature they have to copy
[0:49:23] R0ndras: @neverbornlucky and PR agencies in Japan are banning people from speaking about Palworld too(just in case they actually get sued)
[0:49:30] dright424: An allow reaction and react to feature on videos
[0:49:34] JakeSezz: That’s part of the problem: YouTube could do A LOT, but alas…
[0:49:52] thunduz: @darth_nykal I am holding back until I see how it plays out. I am going to assume about how they said they are getting rid of his sexism?
[0:50:12] rezion_43: Whats the subject I just got here?
[0:50:16] codicier: I'm not even sure we should be looking to youtube. Copyright law just needs redoing from the ground up tbh, its not fit for purpose for 99% of people in a internet age
[0:50:24] R0ndras: @rezion_43 reaction content
[0:50:35] rezion_43: ty
[0:51:03] RileyDoodles_: feel like most people can distinguish between a fair use youtube video and a react stream
[0:51:06] Sampy104: We just need to write out thesis down and nail them to the door of YouTube. this has always worked and ended well, historically speaking
[0:51:10] pyrexmeasurincup: I just came in, why is it pirate time? 🤔
[0:51:13] RileyDoodles_: like when they go to the bog mid stream
[0:51:13] neverbornlucky: Taliesin even though staemboat williee is fair use now disney is going after people using mickey as trademark
[0:51:15] codicier: true tali but i mean more emphasis put on platforms to enforce it
[0:51:19] R0ndras: the problem about redoing copyrihgt laws would be that big companies like Disney would lobby towards themselves and make it even harder for stuff to go public
[0:51:23] mattyxoqt: yeah you're probably right
[0:51:26] Fibnkak: Also the know it's an automated system and understand that youtube doesn't have the man power
[0:51:34] grillat: must be easy fix with ai
[0:51:36] JarJar_Brinkz: Love that Tali is dressed up as a pirate too
[0:51:40] magemaster225: I dont even think Holly knows whats she's teasing anymore with her last few posts
[0:51:44] Reminii91: OH NO, We sure it's not another lay-off annoucement?
[0:51:44] Deatheran: LETSFUCKINGGO we talking about fun stuff
[0:51:46] warrenny: warrenny subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 57 months! reacts stream generally means stealing other ppls content
[0:51:49] theszoti: what if they don't test the entire patch?
[0:51:55] dwolf010: I think no PTR at all for the pirate stuff
[0:51:59] Gingerprimer: Its Pirate time becaus youbers are pirating ppls content
[0:52:02] HSAyril: It's not gonna happen until you make a Weekly Reset about it so chop chop
[0:52:09] theszoti: or what if they don't even announce anything and the patch just drops one day?
[0:52:17] lyrastormblade: lyrastormblade subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 52 months, currently on a 52 month streak! 
[0:52:39] R0ndras: I got mad today about the layoffs because Xbox reported that they're breaking records again... while firing 2k people
[0:52:46] warrenny: agreed
[0:53:00] neverbornlucky: Chat join my new youtube wow channel where I react to nothing but Taliesin on weekly daily where I call him out for everything each week its going to be great react content
[0:53:11] mattyxoqt: thats capitalism
[0:53:13] mattyxoqt: gross
[0:53:16] Deatheran: @R0ndras when they fire people. the salaries are turned into profits
[0:53:28] R0ndras: i know, its sucks @Deatheran
[0:53:36] bettys_dungeon_adventures: layoffs is how they make record profits
[0:53:43] rezion_43: Well there's one common denominator, poor management /leadership....
[0:53:46] bettys_dungeon_adventures: they coast on the work of the people they just laid off
[0:53:47] R0ndras: Thats the best thing nintendo has, in japan. They never fire anyone
[0:53:51] Vinapocalypse: "time to make line go up again"
[0:53:53] Sampy104: I work at Microsoft and I say: F Microsoft and F Wall Street for rewarding this crap
[0:53:57] Vaephera: Is there any news on how the severance was, or any potential of replacement jobs? Microsoft are generally ok on that but I've not seen any real details
[0:54:19] manmower: they'd have to get rid of boards representing shareholders
[0:54:23] Oliraptor: pirate invasions, new zone? ship battles! Pirate flying mounts? what could it bee, yargh
[0:54:26] MrAxeffect: its to reset wages
[0:54:34] Thunder_Obitus: sacking the CEO will probably save more than laying off that 10% too
[0:54:34] snaxx23: Potty mouth NotLikeThis
[0:54:34] ImperfectDark: Can i ask an honest question. It's absolutely horrible, but, Did we expect there to not be terminations in a merger of two similar companies where they both hire similar positions?
[0:54:39] HSAyril: The only opposite instance of this I've read is when the Nintendo CEO or president or whatever took a pay cut so he didn't lose employees
[0:54:43] TaogWoW: But how do you REALLY feel? lol
[0:54:49] kuuple_boople: @TaliesinAndEvitel we need to get a Microwave to lead us
[0:54:54] Sampy104: Microsoft in general severance is good but I’m not sure how it works at acquisitions. A friend got laid off at HoloLens and basically got like 6 months of salary
[0:54:55] ScorpioSymbol: Fuck. That.
[0:55:01] Sorin__: I heard theres a law in japan which means they cant make people redundant unless they're facing bankruptcy
[0:55:01] TiredZubat: oo the welsh accent came through with that ‘toaster’
[0:55:03] darth_nykal: layoffs happen with every merger ever. redundancy sucks but is a reality
[0:55:03] R0ndras: @HSAyril they have 99% retention of employees. But the reality behind it is that its because of Japan labor laws.
[0:55:38] R0ndras: The thing about the merger layoffs is that they come after last year Microsoft(without mergers) fired thousands of people too
[0:55:41] manmower: i bet the battlepass will be cooler next xpac
[0:55:42] Kortinas: Hello Gamers!
[0:55:54] Sampy104: Once we are down to one company that makes all games it will be fine
[0:56:00] ScorpioSymbol: I've been a AAA dev for 20+ years, and I've never worked somewhere that didn't use layoffs as a yearly cycle. Unionize now.
[0:56:01] darth_nykal: id argue some studios have benefited from mergers, such as insomniac
[0:56:09] Sorin__: Its a reality, but it clearly doesnt have to be. Especially if they're cancelling games cos they laid off the team
[0:56:13] Deatheran: @TaliesinAndEvitel i think its been mentioned. but over time companies turn from product generating entities into just banks that make stonk number go up
[0:56:33] R0ndras: @darth_nykal that wasnt a merger, they got bought.  Insomniac was a private company.
[0:56:36] DozlaT: we need to make game industry like the US food industry where 4 companies own everything
[0:56:38] neverbornlucky: Taliesin when do you get sponsored by  Apple VR  games ?
[0:56:41] manmower: it's still big for the IP
[0:56:53] BIuffwatcher: must still make them a lot of money.  They won't want to blow that up?
[0:57:10] Sampy104: ABK sounds like a serial killer moniker
[0:57:11] darth_nykal: @R0ndras fair point
[0:57:22] ChrisStoll: That's exactly happened when my company got bought and merged with another one. We're still the cash cow funding their failing products, but we're the step child
[0:57:44] Thunder_Obitus: get digging. dont be an afk'er
[0:57:45] darth_nykal: my hubby is hoping they bring wow to xbox, he cant get used to keyboard/mouse
[0:58:12] R0ndras: Im sure they will bring WoW even to switch 2 , if they can port it properly
[0:58:22] gryffiest: are we expecting 🏴‍☠️ news soon?
[0:58:35] DragnosiOfNede: it’s a margin question. it could make 100M in profit, but If its margin is 7% and the majority of their portfolio makes 35% margin, it will not survive
[0:58:44] Thoreya: pirate time pog
[0:59:15] HSAyril: "Something"
[0:59:17] darth_nykal: oooh spill the tea!
[0:59:19] DozlaT: interesting, so stuff is pushed back
[0:59:31] nzreaper: ermahgerdd xD what was it dude?!
[0:59:32] puntualus: Arr Tali! happy pirate patch day
[0:59:35] R0ndras: by the way, the solo dungeons with bots.  Are they coming to the older dungeons too? At some point I mean
[0:59:44] Reminii91: would whatever news it is worth a resub, Tali? I've gotten AoTC, the mounts, the stories 10.2.5... : /
[0:59:49] Collected1: ARRRR it be pirates
[1:00:12] EighthEndless: @R0ndras thats the idea, but nothing is confirmed yet.  ion said theyre working on it
[1:00:16] thunduz: Do you think it'll be VamPirates?
[1:00:36] manmower: maybe they skull and bones on the roadmap were the marker for layoffs
[1:00:38] NeeK_23: NeeK_23 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 55 months, currently on a 54 month streak! weekly reset pirate edition
[1:00:39] R0ndras: @EighthEndless oh cool. I love wow but im not very sociable so im waiting for this feature
[1:00:47] puntualus: also Holly
[1:00:51] Derployd: They are promoting the pirate skins in Overwatch 2 this week. It HAS to happen before the next reset.
[1:01:01] mattyxoqt: I really like holly
[1:01:02] JarJar_Brinkz: Watch the pirate flag just mean they're cracking down on private servers
[1:01:07] donovun: laser death chicken confirmed
[1:01:08] puntualus: lol indeed
[1:01:08] EighthEndless: @R0ndras itd be super nice to have, for sure
[1:01:19] manmower: pirate hat day
[1:01:19] DozlaT: holly is the ogmot of wow twitter
[1:01:25] Quachiri: What's the chicken from Holly mean?
[1:01:27] R0ndras: @EighthEndless yeah, and for raids too. At least the basic ones that dont require complex mechanics
[1:01:29] thunduz: @TaliesinAndEvitel and they randomly dropped Warcraft2. Tides of Darkness Tali, TIDES...I mean
[1:01:51] darth_nykal: and diablo
[1:01:56] theszoti: Wrath of the Tuskarr Chicken Pirates?
[1:02:01] thunduz: no no no let's forget about those other 2 things.
[1:02:06] manmower: they're probably giving us playable pirate ships
[1:02:10] KyleS07: Parrot twitch drop too
[1:02:11] DozlaT: chicken means theyre putting palworld in wow
[1:02:16] Thoreya: usually in 2 hours they announce stuff
[1:02:16] JarJar_Brinkz: Pirate chicken PoroSad
[1:02:27] thunduz: @DozlaT I'm down for that lol
[1:02:28] NeeK_23: 6pm UK is the usual time for news

[1:04:03] nadiaaa: it's a pirate set on the store LUL oh no imagine the outrage
[1:04:06] JarJar_Brinkz: As a pirate enthusiast.... My hopes are severely down LUL
[1:04:06] thunduz: you already raised my hopes. I am expecting Pirates and housing
[1:04:07] sterlz_the_ok: BatChest
[1:04:16] Ysarahhh: idk what youre on about its clearly player housing
[1:04:19] Sch1ey: Anything less then mage tower with a pvp tie in that is perfectly balance or riots
[1:04:20] HSAyril: It's going to be as big as major patch
[1:04:22] darth_nykal: counter-argument: if it wasnt big why hide it?
[1:04:24] maccaruso: Clearly it will be a Starcraft/Warcraft tie-in
[1:04:27] darkmagi08: darkmagi08 subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 23 months! 
[1:04:27] manmower: maybe it's a small pirate story
[1:04:29] Merex760: it’s gonna be a new 6 month sub pirate transmog
[1:04:30] Thoreya: why are they teasing it so much
[1:04:32] Mazerbeam: Not only will my hopes be up, something else will be too! And you can't stop me!
[1:04:33] lukeKing96: I hope it’s just something fun and daft, doesn’t need to be something huge for me.
[1:04:36] donovun: pvp related maybe
[1:04:39] JarJar_Brinkz: Its gonna be nothing
[1:04:42] manmower: it has to be decent or they wouldn't tease it so much
[1:04:43] thunduz: it's a small fun pirate event
[1:04:46] Tahalamaius: i unfortunately feel like due to the mystery that they’ve done with this the hype is going to be too high
[1:04:54] bottis96: I love new news but i don't want to know everything before i play it. Need a surprise that's good that does not fall flat .
[1:04:54] HeyheyReirei: we have to be getting our own ships lol
[1:04:56] blumberquack: Trolls will finally be getting beards! Pirate beards PogChamp
[1:05:02] BIuffwatcher: It was a recoloured pirate hat... but then they saw the hype and paniced!
[1:05:04] Vaephera: If they were going to keep it a secret til launch, I figure we'd at least get a note about it so people knew not to expect news
[1:05:06] corpas_: what if the skull actually represents undead and my character is finally getting his back fixed????
[1:05:08] theszoti: just a pirate invasion world event every hour probably
[1:05:11] manmower: maybe they're letting us wear double eyepatches
[1:05:15] thunduz: also with the side eyes. The side eyes don't help tame hype
[1:05:23] Collected1: is there any chance it's skipping the PTR?
[1:05:25] puntualus: Nightsquall in game every 30 min
[1:05:25] JarJar_Brinkz: Same LUL
[1:05:36] kaguranne: I think it's smaller because they just have a picture on it rather than a list of stuff
[1:05:37] neverbornlucky: Taliesin do you think Ai can make a better diablo4 game then blizzard ?
[1:05:42] Derployd: The biggest thing I think it could be is reusing the Islands from BfA to "preview" the Delve system, but they wont call it Delves, it'll be Plunders or something like that.
[1:05:47] Reminii91: you mean you're not gonna keep doing them till WW?
[1:05:49] thunduz: yeah kind of not worth
[1:05:55] ebrahim_91: I am getting exalted on that only for OCD reasons
[1:05:56] JarJar_Brinkz: I haven't done any of the new stuff because it doesn't interest me much, BUT if there's pirate event? I'm exalted in an hour
[1:05:59] lofibanshee: Ahoy matey
[1:06:02] Thunder_Obitus: still afk at the digs for the rewards though
[1:06:04] manmower: maybe they're combining torghast and islands into a pirate island system
[1:06:08] databob1: I got 5he full dig transmog set once I buy all the stuff I'm done...screw the rep
[1:06:15] MrAxeffect: every time you mention digs, i remember they are a thing
[1:06:31] Aakku: Aakku subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 58 months! It's just an old AOTC mount give away to just watch the world burn.
[1:06:36] SquiggySquonk: Hear me out. You know how there’s the all male Tuskarr in Northrend? The clearly gay tribe? What about lesbian Tuskarr pirates!
[1:06:41] Fibnkak: if there was more then one dig location
[1:06:42] Darkuwa: Is an announcement coming or something?
[1:06:52] thunduz: Pirate housing
[1:06:52] chronos789: I'll do digs until I can buy the mount, then I'll probably stop
[1:06:54] donovun: pirates vs archivists digging for treasure, an expansion on the big dig event
[1:06:57] jmalmin: Harbringer quests what is that?
[1:06:59] JarJar_Brinkz: @SquiggySquonk LMAO
[1:07:02] tiglath_pilaser: Question for Tali or the chat: who is the music artist for the intro music on Twitch?
[1:07:10] HeyheyReirei: pirate ship housing copium
[1:07:12] witchhobbit: i thought you got a title?
[1:07:14] nadiaaa: i'm getting flashbacks to the avowed rep from SL
[1:07:18] witchhobbit: or is that for the meta
[1:07:18] ebrahim_91: yeah each rep tier sshould have given something like the time rift one
[1:07:20] CloudyHS: holly is killing me with these teasers, its been like 3 weeks
[1:07:21] NeeK_23: @tiglath_pilaser Jay the Bard
[1:07:37] Vaephera: The title is from the meta, not the rep itself. You also need to do like 6+ weeks of dailies
[1:07:41] witchhobbit: the time rift rep was better yeah
[1:07:44] Reminii91: how did they not make the retaking of Glineas a whole patch worth of campaigning with activities and stuff instead, like a weekly progression until they've completely taken it over....
[1:07:44] tiglath_pilaser: @NeeK_23 thx
[1:07:47] oneunder5285: maybe island player housing
[1:07:48] neverbornlucky: Taliesin google MSI claw you so need this hand held
[1:07:49] donovun: we're gamers we make number go up
[1:08:00] puntualus: Maurice tneMaurice tneEviHeart
[1:08:11] Derployd: I hate the Cobalt Assembly rep grind, but at least every rank gives us something for the most part
[1:08:13] CloudyHS: @TaliesinAndEvitel i got rank 5 this tuesday and it took me doing 12+ digs a day , its a slog
[1:08:34] thunduz: @TaliesinAndEvitel what if its an in game event to where you can queue as a group and travel to different islands that has objectives to complete.
[1:08:35] NeeK_23: @tiglath_pilaser its on spotify too
[1:08:40] DozlaT: oh no its a breadtuber

[1:08:51] thunduz: I don't use it much at home though
[1:08:58] JarJar_Brinkz: Only a measly $4000
[1:09:02] JarJar_Brinkz: btw only has 5 games
[1:09:03] neverbornlucky: it can run xbox game pass and steam games
[1:09:04] puntualus: tneTaliCry

[1:13:58] thunduz: you can put steam on it
[1:14:00] R0ndras: @JarJar_Brinkz No, because it uses Intel Arc so most older games arent compatible
[1:14:02] bobbybigbuxx: there is no way it is worth 700
[1:14:02] tumtuhm: @warrenny i'm saying just round it up
[1:14:02] neverbornlucky: Taliesin it RUNS steamos
[1:14:03] Synkronos: It says right there, same storage just worse CPU
[1:14:05] bobbybigbuxx: I would pay 200ish
[1:14:07] Hotstitute: Peppa pigs big adventure simulator
[1:14:08] CloudyHS: D:
[1:14:10] JarJar_Brinkz: @R0ndras terrible
[1:14:25] CloudyHS: yeah but it has the bisexual lighting
[1:14:27] Synkronos: Yup! This whole thing sounds terrible
[1:14:32] Derployd: Is it that price because lenovo is that price?
[1:14:33] jumzo: I'd rather have less storage and buy an sd card like with the cheap steam deck
[1:14:33] nathan_melton: Good morning Tali!
[1:14:41] goqu3D: paying for that bi premium
[1:14:44] corpas_: but you can't play wow on a PS5 Kappa
[1:14:45] JarJar_Brinkz: We should put a downpayment on the MSI BMW instead Kappa
[1:14:45] bobbybigbuxx: PS5 > whatever this garbage is
[1:14:48] thunduz: oooo PS5 stream incoming?
[1:14:55] HSAyril: Took a page from Apple. "Does less, costs more. It's that simple."
[1:14:57] tumtuhm: you don't have a phone?
[1:15:11] Reminii91: D4 BAD
[1:15:13] thunduz: I do sadly
[1:15:15] bobbybigbuxx: diablo 4 was always bad
[1:15:16] Venbombadil: everyone does even elon musk
[1:15:17] darth_nykal: i love d4
[1:15:18] jumzo: I think people just hate blizzard
[1:15:19] grillat: D4 _ _ _ ?
[1:15:19] Derployd: People love and hate it right now
[1:15:21] Hotstitute: i made it to level 8 this season.. and fell asleep.. actually fell asleep
[1:15:24] pissvibing: D4 is not good for hardcore playersw
[1:15:25] kikisume: I'm playing D4. I'm enjoying it
[1:15:34] lithium364: d4 feels they pulled most dev away from the game already
[1:15:36] Durwen: One month in, they really screwed the game with patch one
[1:15:36] magemaster225: its a we're so back/ it's so over situation
[1:15:37] pissvibing: its awful for people who want lots of playtime out of ARPGs
[1:15:40] MisterBongwater: Liked the campaign, never stuck with it like D3
[1:15:42] Synkronos: People are angry cos s2 was looking better, and then the new season came along and shat the bed all over again
[1:15:43] Sorin__: I havent played in a while, but really enjoyed when i did
[1:15:44] JarJar_Brinkz: $43.86
[1:15:46] HSAyril: G/f and I went through the campaign once. Worth the free tattoo
[1:15:47] Derployd: Season 2 was enjoyed, season 3 was negative at launch, but its "fixed" now
[1:15:49] Vaephera: I don't hate it but I haven't felt any urge to play seasons or try and grind to endgame
[1:15:50] Hotstitute: $20... ive got more content outa $30 palworld
[1:15:52] pissvibing: its okay in other ways
[1:15:57] Teth33: D4 season 3 was a shitshow at launch. They did a couple of patches and now it feel a lot better. Plus they are doing a lunar new year event next week.
[1:15:59] rynntiltius: People have unrealistic expectations > those expectations are not met > game sux lul
[1:15:59] dwolf010: I liked launch and season 2 the others are shit imo
[1:16:00] Harper_n7: I LOVED the music when it came out but never played it. Diablo not really my thing
[1:16:00] Sorin__: Probably go back to it at some point
[1:16:11] pissvibing: exactly, its kinda an ARPG staple
[1:16:13] Hotstitute: D3 has a higher player base atm
[1:16:15] Venbombadil: @TaliesinAndEvitel did you the tweet see musk dissing blizzard balance team? it was a proper the worst guy you know made a good point feeling
[1:16:16] GingerBear30: I play it casually, along with a bunch of other games, enshrouded, grim dawn, last epoch ....and the list goes on lol
[1:16:17] Durwen: It's Diablo. I enjoyed 2 for years
[1:16:32] pissvibing: ARPGs tend to be "forever games" so its just kinda a pavlov issue, the playerbase is trained for that
[1:16:35] HSAyril: Being HotS back
[1:16:36] R0ndras: Might be just me, but I think its time for ARPGs to move on from the standard 4 abilities.  It gets boring fast.
[1:16:36] JarJar_Brinkz: 8 years old
[1:16:37] HSAyril: Bring
[1:16:38] nadiaaa: i like overwatch but yeah the changes are questionable sometimes LUL
[1:16:38] CloudyHS: was
[1:16:44] JarJar_Brinkz: Almost 8 years*
[1:16:45] Teth33: D4 is like D3 for me. Play for a week or so, come back every few months.
[1:16:47] Harper_n7: kinda like my kids LUL
[1:16:53] CloudyHS: ow2 is only 1.5 years old
[1:16:57] thunduz: Warcraft has proven to be the one thats stayed fun for me
[1:16:59] neverbornlucky: Taliesin microsoft is going to make Diablo4 great again with AI instead of devs
[1:17:01] databob1: 🏴‍☠️🏴‍☠️🏴‍☠️🏴‍☠️🏴‍☠️
[1:17:03] Derployd: I lot of the people that actively hate OW2 are still playing it because they hate the alternatives even more
[1:17:07] CloudyHS: lol true
[1:17:08] darth_nykal: liar, i played the shit outta mario64 when the remaster came out
[1:17:10] Derployd: OW2 is a glorified patch
[1:17:14] jumzo: I can't believe metal gear solid 3 isn't popular anymore. kojima dropped the ball with that one
[1:17:15] JarJar_Brinkz: Tagging 2 on the back of games is just the new way to rehype it
[1:17:16] thunduz: OW2 doesn't exist
[1:17:31] Caryartomlis: based on zero evidence I believe that 10.2.6 is going to be returning to the Forbidden Reach again
[1:17:32] darth_nykal: except WoW
[1:17:36] Reminii91: OW2 is officially dedge now, isn't it?
[1:17:41] kaijoe_: I mean, I think consumers sorta drive that a bit, with dollar to hour metrics and bullshit like that
[1:17:47] CloudyHS: i really need 10.2.6 news im strugglin over here
[1:17:47] JarJar_Brinkz: @Reminii91 No?
[1:17:48] pissvibing: to be fair, i am not hyper critical of diablo 4, and even i am pretty dissapointed in their seasons @TaliesinAndEvitel
[1:17:49] Teth33: I think that expectation is more the product of internet hive mind rather than personal objectivity.
[1:17:50] rynntiltius: For me Diablo is just go in, crush some demons to destress, leave until I need to crush some demons again, idk what people expect from it really
[1:17:52] databob1: I was fine with overwatch until they started craving out to put out overwatch 2
[1:17:59] JarJar_Brinkz: They have a new esports thing starting soon, doubt its dead tbh
[1:18:03] pissvibing: i like D4 on launch but its seasons are pretty dissapoiting
[1:18:08] dwolf010: @JarJar_Brinkz its just as dead as wow is according to the internet
[1:18:10] Hotstitute: yeah, but whats your opinion on the purple love is in the air outfit being on the Store?
[1:18:21] Teth33: Season 2 was banger
[1:18:22] JarJar_Brinkz: @dwolf010 yeah straight up
[1:18:31] GingerBear30: season 2, was going in the right direction
[1:18:33] atamala: i think the main issue is build diversity, there is no freedom or creativity really.
[1:18:35] pissvibing: they really made people think there would be like more story like wow patches, but instead its just random filler story in the seasons
[1:18:39] Darkuwa: So weird hearing you not at 2x speed
[1:18:43] Thunder_Obitus: overwatch 2 is super predatory
[1:18:43] databob1: I just wasn't interested enough in d4 to spend the money
[1:18:44] jumzo: The real reason d4 is bad is that they didn't add the paladin yet
[1:18:46] neverbornlucky: Taliesin , Evitel can play Final Fantasy Online on the MSI  claw cheaper then trying to get her ff account  password back
[1:18:50] Durwen: THe game was balanced for hardcore, I think
[1:18:58] thunduz: I love a good grinding session
[1:18:58] Sorin__: Hardcore is the better way to play
[1:19:05] FlappyFlapster: FlappyFlapster subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 22 months, currently on a 22 month streak! Jeez its been almost 2 years already
[1:19:09] kosatbf: @jumzo Basing a games quality off one class.. lel
[1:19:10] goqu3D: Yeah base game didnt feel very challenging it was just kinda mindless
[1:19:48] Teth33: Not every game has to be a home run. We've just had a lot of home runs lately that makes those that aren't feel bad.
[1:19:51] dright424: People care more about the things they hate rather than the things they like lately. I have had to unfollow a lot of people on social media to avoid so much negativity.
[1:19:56] thunduz: barbarian was fun for a time
[1:19:58] theszoti: i feel like none of the classes are interesting enough or have any depth
[1:20:07] OILTIME: "yet" ? Paladins dont exist canonically anymore. They are extinct.
[1:20:28] CloudyHS: HUH
[1:20:31] Venbombadil: the real reason d4 was bad was they published it like 3-6 months earlier without endgame for and easy buck. early d4 campaign was really fun but then it flopped real quick and never recovered
[1:20:31] HSAyril: Barbarian was awful. A ton of bosses are hugely anti-melee. I dropped a boss as sorcerer in a 1/4 of the time it took my barbarian to
[1:20:36] CloudyHS: let him cook
[1:20:38] SphericFormula: Now that's a take
[1:20:40] thunduz: really cool cinematics
[1:20:45] Reminii91: he's cooking
[1:20:51] bettys_dungeon_adventures: wow thats an extra hot take LUL
[1:20:54] deadmedicxiii: Time wasting?
[1:20:56] jumzo: getting paid
[1:20:57] theszoti: barbarian was pressing 3 shouts and then auto attacking everything, not exactly the epitome of peak class design
[1:21:00] atamala: a pirate would have this take
[1:21:04] NeeK_23: to crush the capitalist store
[1:21:06] rynntiltius: Mephisto romance when? KappaPride
[1:21:35] Fibnkak: So make it too big to fail
[1:21:37] CloudyHS: well its an ARPG its all about optimizing the grind
[1:21:38] witchhobbit: so as a stardew valley lover, would i love diablo
[1:21:39] Giralte: get the stuff so the ghost of your grandpa is happy
[1:21:40] Redmanpig: thought it was to Merry Penny
[1:21:40] thunduz: I don't know how to feel that he is going to make this make perfect sense lol
[1:21:40] HSAyril: Haha
[1:21:56] Reminii91: sooo... what tali is saying is, we might have a Lilith romance route in future dlc...POG
[1:22:12] kosatbf: TRUE
[1:22:21] CloudyHS: well uber lilith requires playing u cant rly afk it
[1:22:26] deadmedicxiii: Oh... no, not the way i play
[1:22:28] atamala: that's path of exile too
[1:22:34] atamala: any arpg
[1:22:36] Dred_Scythe: ...That's all the ARPG ATM, not just Diablo.
[1:22:36] Eregbueye: same for all arpg
[1:22:40] thunduz: but how how did you make that work?! lol
[1:22:42] neverbornlucky: Taliesin thats palworld
[1:22:47] kaijoe_: Now I want Mr. Stardew to fight Diablo
[1:23:11] witchhobbit: it's missing the romance tho isn't it
[1:23:13] deadmedicxiii: Afk builds suck, imo
[1:23:15] thunduz: perfect sense
[1:23:19] Thunder_Obitus: both stardew and diablo 4 - gotta farm
[1:23:19] atamala: let me romance some hot demons please
[1:23:37] Harper_n7: I beg to differ
[1:23:38] Teth33: Romance Lilith when?
[1:23:56] markaud23: Maru is just tacked on top? how dare you.
[1:24:03] Harper_n7: No, it's all about the romance
[1:24:13] Harper_n7: as Diablo should be
[1:24:21] manmower: POE is even less buttons
[1:24:22] jimbrown2510: Tali, did you know that the german voice actress of lilith also is the speaker of german top news?
[1:24:26] HSAyril: tneSuperM1 tneSuperM2
[1:24:31] HSAyril: tneSuperM3 tneSuperM4
[1:24:38] JarJar_Brinkz: Why do youtubers Hold....?
[1:24:44] Harper_n7: I want to meet a misunderstood demon and build a nice little house on a hillside
[1:24:47] Teth33: That's why I get angry with "meta" builds. I like to actually play my games, not set it and forget it.
[1:24:51] neverbornlucky: Taliesin would AI make a better diablo4 then blizzard?
[1:24:52] Cidal_: think we might get a 10.2.6 announcement today?
[1:24:53] JarJar_Brinkz: Thumbnail on the right LUL
[1:24:58] pissvibing: thats one of my problems with it, i am a slower arpg fan and they kinda said they would aim to please my crowd, but the hardcore ARPG crowd tends to be more zoom zoom fans, and so they have kinda trended towards zoom zoom @TaliesinAndEvitel
[1:25:00] deadmedicxiii: Different strokes for different folks I guess, but i don't play those kinda builds
[1:25:05] JarJar_Brinkz: OHHH
[1:25:09] pissvibing: but in that way they pleased no one, its kind of medium paced @TaliesinAndEvitel
[1:25:12] jimbrown2510: And everytime lilith comes to the scene in my mind it´s like: "Hello and good evenying, this is top news for sanctuario!"
[1:25:12] Teth33: The awesome Tom Nicholas vid
[1:25:25] JarJar_Brinkz: Oh neat
[1:25:26] Teth33: Tom is a big Tali stan
[1:25:36] Eregbueye: thats because you are a beautiful man
[1:25:42] gsrasslan: Love the some more news
[1:25:53] Dextronus: Hey there Tali! first time catching the stream even tho i followed since a while ago. (transitioning from youtube frog to twitch lurker)   Honestly i miss Retail WoW. Do you think the game is fun enough to return now? or should i wait till next expansion?
[1:26:22] thunduz: I think T&E needs to set the new meta and start using Megaphones
[1:27:01] Thoreya: m+ season is by far the best
[1:27:04] Dextronus: Oh wow... I played till... Season 2 i think? before the whole emerald dream shennanigans
[1:27:28] thunduz: come back for pirate fun times
[1:27:41] gsrasslan: And everyone complained about throne of the tides
[1:27:47] gsrasslan: But it's so fun!
[1:27:51] HSAyril: 10.2.6, butt pirates
[1:28:04] jasperthefae: do you think it's worth coming back for someone who hasn't played since Castle Nathria
[1:28:04] Thoreya: and we got s4 soon...hopefully its something fresh
[1:28:05] EighthEndless: @gsrasslan basically anything that has to do with water ALWAYS gets a ton of complaints lol
[1:28:07] atamala: 13 years xD
[1:28:18] HSAyril: These pirates are looking for a different kind of booty
[1:28:20] Dextronus: Honestly since i can't pay the subscription i used to buy gametime with gold but the economy ... Just went bad so quickly than i found myself having to ACTUALL try to make gold to buy it so omg
[1:28:22] NinjaMegaMan7: NinjaMegaMan7 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 25 months! 
[1:28:23] JoeTheRedcoat: I enjoyed Throne and Vortex Pinacle last season honestly.
[1:28:29] warrenny: ppl crying about riseis funnier
[1:28:33] Dextronus: Nut actually Dragonflight is so fun tho...
[1:28:33] Derployd: I love the changes to Throne of Tides.
[1:28:35] shivena_: Hey Chat. Not so quick question to you all. (: How did you guys pick your main in wow? For me its kinda hard to stick to a class and not wanting to swap constantly. ): That's also the reason I haven't played in a while.
[1:28:38] jumzo: don't let castle nathria be your final taste of wow
[1:28:41] Harper_n7: @jasperthefae Oh, you've missed so much cool shit
[1:28:42] Arlaeya: They put the M+ version of ToT in Timewalking and I was so confused! I was like, where's the jellyfish elevator!
[1:28:43] Haelix87: i liked VP, the rest of my guild not so much
[1:28:47] neverbornlucky: Taliesin there was a new game preview that people are watching that is 9 minutes long something with metal gear characters and guitar hero
[1:28:57] mattyxoqt: Im back i havent played since legion, just got the war within and use my boost, trying to wrap my head around things
[1:28:58] TheSonicDwarf: i just came back after leaving shadowlands, im having fun. lvl'd another surv hunter and gearing up now
[1:28:59] Derployd: Find a guide
[1:29:02] thunduz: Castle Natheria is was the end of Shadowlands. Daddy D was an main amazing villain
[1:29:03] DozlaT: @shivena_ I just went with aesthetics of the spells when i was younger and havent really changed since
[1:29:04] jasperthefae: bet may make a comeback then
[1:29:11] Darkuwa: What would max level be if they hadn't reset them?
[1:29:28] blumberquack: @shivena_ Got back into the game leveling a BM hunter, saw Survival and thought "huh, i need a melee? interesting" aaaand after trying it it stuck with me LUL
[1:29:36] jumzo: 120 in bfa
[1:29:37] gsrasslan: 120 in BFA
[1:29:40] EighthEndless: 120bfa
[1:29:42] dwolf010: they need to fix the story for new/returning players. all quests up at once is confusing
[1:29:43] Caryartomlis: BFA
[1:29:43] jumzo: It would be 140 now
[1:29:44] Saumur: 120 in BfA and reset in SL
[1:29:45] atamala: shadowlands reset it
[1:29:47] gsrasslan: Shadowlands reset it
[1:29:48] darth_nykal: sl was the reset
[1:29:51] siggyfisk: Btw quests addon is helpful but even then you have to check which patch the quest belongs to. It took me 2 weeks to catch up chronologically. Worth it.
[1:29:51] EighthEndless: down to 50 in SL prepatch
[1:29:53] bottis96: With the ADD ON "All the things" there is so much more to do in game. Without most addons like this it would be so much harder and some things impossible for casual players.
[1:29:54] Caryartomlis: end of bfa for shadowlands
[1:30:00] dwolf010: yup
[1:30:01] shivena_: @DozlaT <3 ty
[1:30:09] Saumur: Funnily enough: 100 would be the max level after the World Soul Saga - So another squish thereafter would be fine imho
[1:30:15] dwolf010: cant see a new player wanting to level 150 levels lol
[1:30:17] jumzo: having 120 levels was so daunting and inaccessible for new players
[1:30:17] Torkelnder: I think its kinda crazy that they are not doing a stat quish with war within
[1:30:20] kenjura: the real question is: what would ilvl be
[1:30:33] Thoreya: @Torkelnder im glad theyre not, i like big numbers
[1:30:34] shivena_: @blumberquack haha ty to you too. :D Its always nice to hear about ppls reasons to stick to one class in particular :)
[1:30:51] darth_nykal: oh god dont tell 14 stans that
[1:30:56] Saumur: However, relying on Addons to be good, makes a game bad, I think LUL
[1:30:57] JarJar_Brinkz: Soccer DinoDance
[1:31:01] Dextronus: There's always something that an addon can do that is kind of good xD
[1:31:04] Derployd: The auto-grouping addon from BfA drove me map. Hated people that used that
[1:31:13] Derployd: *mad
[1:31:13] siggyfisk: Wow needs to get better at introducing returning player to the right quests. Whether you'd want current content or play through the patches chronologically
[1:31:24] neverbornlucky: Taliesin youtube the Death Stranding 2  On the Beach trailer
[1:31:36] Nice_n_Dicey: like xcom
[1:31:43] 6sixthousand6: striper no striping
[1:31:45] Nice_n_Dicey: :)
[1:31:48] Alonarius: I do the same with the MotoGP racing sim game
[1:31:48] TheSonicDwarf: what this pirate stuff i keep hearing about?
[1:31:51] neverbornlucky: you have to see the death stranding trailoer
[1:32:00] JarJar_Brinkz: Will you do a pack opening stream?
[1:32:05] DaMoooore: You'd love football manager !
[1:32:13] Teth33: That's like when they say Fantasy Football is D&D for jocks.
[1:32:32] viirracocha: Football manager been a thing since late 90s :)
[1:33:25] Redmanpig: which footballer was your favorite player growing up?
[1:33:29] jasperthefae: is the overall required grindiness the same, more, or less than shadowlands
[1:33:32] Derployd: Careful, its EA, they might ban that addon and make that a subscription DLC feature
[1:33:55] dwolf010: wait what addons did do you use?
[1:34:06] dwolf010: the renowns tho
[1:34:10] dwolf010: the OG
[1:34:14] dwolf010: for quests
[1:34:24] Thoreya: its just grinding for gear upgrades honestly
[1:34:25] tiy_baptism: profession knowledge
[1:34:26] darth_nykal: they are if you want the story :(
[1:34:28] Thoreya: crests and flightstones
[1:34:30] HSAyril: Do people just root on whatever team they were born closest to or how does that work?
[1:34:32] dwolf010: the OG renowns have quests locked behind
[1:34:32] Haelix87: even now i only have 1 reknown at max lvl
[1:34:39] Haelix87: and terrible spelling
[1:34:39] EighthEndless: except the tuskar renown.  NEED THE OTTER MOUNT
[1:34:51] darth_nykal: tuskarr, duh
[1:34:56] thunduz: @TaliesinAndEvitel tneTaliCry they cancelled production of the Wrathion statue
[1:34:58] dwolf010: and ysara return no?
[1:35:00] witchhobbit: i totally forgot about the renown quests like the tyr one
[1:35:05] skeletonetiquette: They do have minimal power but it's not much
[1:35:06] Thoreya: i played since launch and i think my mains highest renown is 7 LUL
[1:35:07] witchhobbit: your video reminded me of that
[1:35:08] jasperthefae: dope that makes me so happy. Cuz the required grind of WoW really turned me off with how busy my life is
[1:35:31] JarJar_Brinkz: Just vendor trash
[1:35:35] EighthEndless: expensive xmog lol
[1:35:43] thunduz: but they gave game time as compensation so I guess that works?
[1:35:52] witchhobbit: legendaries and cosmetics
[1:35:57] JoeTheRedcoat: And the conduits right?
[1:35:59] skeletonetiquette: They have the augment rune, which is helpful for sure but you can go without it or just buy them as consumables
[1:35:59] witchhobbit: still working on the cosmetics now
[1:36:03] bottis96: Did they say that renown will be shared in Dragonflight in the future across Alts?
[1:36:05] Reminii91: ugh the memories...
[1:36:06] Thoreya: i do miss a lil bfa grind but its whateva
[1:36:10] Thoreya: i know most dont
[1:36:12] theszoti: and renown if you wanted to catch up
[1:36:25] witcherpie: u literally didnt have to do torghast every single week lol, i did torghast like 5 times total and i was donezos
[1:36:28] Thoreya: war within renown yes
[1:36:33] Thoreya: idk about older ones
[1:36:35] dwolf010: they did. but they need time to do it
[1:36:40] EighthEndless: they said renown will be shared in your warband, yea
[1:36:41] kaijoe_: They said they're gonna try to work on the old ones over time
[1:36:42] warrenny: they removed the grind from the mmo
[1:36:44] pernvandamme: pernvandamme is gifting 5 Tier 1 Subs to TaliesinAndEvitel's community! They've gifted a total of 50 in the channel! 
[1:36:44] pernvandamme: pernvandamme gifted a Tier 1 sub to Starmango! 
[1:36:44] pernvandamme: pernvandamme gifted a Tier 1 sub to zindrassil! 
[1:36:44] pernvandamme: pernvandamme gifted a Tier 1 sub to kosatbf! 
[1:36:44] pernvandamme: pernvandamme gifted a Tier 1 sub to BoomBangBashBoing! 
[1:36:44] pernvandamme: pernvandamme gifted a Tier 1 sub to oswineshir! 
[1:36:46] Popicus: @bottis96 War within Renown will, and they want to make it retroactive starting with DF
[1:36:47] Derployd: That grind was so unncessary for most players in SL. A level 5 Legendary was only a little bit better than level 1. It was ignorable if you weren't racing
[1:36:47] Darkuwa: Stygia for sockets
[1:36:48] dright424: Ion said DF will be the first old reputation to be shared
[1:36:51] DiscordianKitty: i think they said they wanted to do it retroactively
[1:36:56] skeletonetiquette: Yeah warband renown was mentioned
[1:37:15] Aakku: love shared portals
[1:37:22] Aakku: for level 20 keys
[1:37:30] Reminii91: yea warband needs to be in wow, NOW
[1:37:36] thunduz: tneGo tneGo tneGo tneMovEEE tneMovEEE tneMovEEE tneMovEEE
[1:37:37] Ireheart_: Can't wait for the new character screen
[1:37:42] Darkuwa: Probably one expansion back for every xpac forward probably
[1:37:43] bucephalos: Lets see what they do with factions like Aldor/Scryer
[1:37:44] Ireheart_: With multiple chars
[1:37:44] shivena_: Warbands are so cool. I'm sad we still have to wait for them :/
[1:38:17] Ireheart_: @shivena_ They are coming before the expansion I think
[1:38:19] atamala: i think you want that as the tattoo
[1:38:23] thunduz: @TaliesinAndEvitel not sure if you ordered the wrathion statue but they just sent out emails that they cancelled production on them.
[1:38:38] Derployd: face tatoo as penance
[1:38:40] darth_nykal: "very much" lol, like 4 days
[1:38:48] thunduz: nop
[1:39:02] thunduz: game time compensation
[1:39:05] Arlaeya: "unforeseen circumstances"
[1:39:08] darth_nykal: yeah it's crazy how hard that was advertised at blizzcon
[1:39:08] Arlaeya: I totally ordered it
[1:39:12] JarJar_Brinkz: Was it microsofts doing SwiftRage
[1:39:18] thunduz: I did
[1:39:23] blumberquack: £1100 monkaS
[1:39:24] JarJar_Brinkz: 404
[1:39:24] databob1: WTF??? WHY???
[1:39:24] thunduz: RIP
[1:39:26] NeeK_23: £1100? nah fam, too much
[1:39:27] Arlaeya: issues with production apparently
[1:39:38] magemaster225: this wouldnt have happened if he was aspect /s
[1:39:39] JarJar_Brinkz: Hair too majestic? Kappa
[1:39:49] JarJar_Brinkz: That lip shine tho
[1:39:50] puntualus: its in thai currency also?
[1:39:50] shivena_: F. It looked really cool.
[1:39:51] NeeK_23: no statue should cost that much
[1:39:58] lithium364: did the people making the stature got laid off too Kappa
[1:40:02] thunduz: It's dope but very spendy and takes up a lot of my bookcase
[1:40:06] Teddimijia: i don't order statues. i dont have thatt kinda cash xD  and no place to put it
[1:40:08] Derployd: Is it a resin statue?
[1:40:10] nadiaaa: in this economy?!
[1:40:10] CochaCR: you and me
[1:40:10] Vaephera: I could believe production issues as well, many of these statues are ridiculously fiddly and fragile, I've seen that happen for other games
[1:40:12] shivena_: @lithium364 Probably xD
[1:40:15] MrAxeffect: OMG imagine dusting that thing
[1:40:16] woodnf: gorgeous
[1:40:22] dwolf010: @TaliesinAndEvitel did you see the nextflix quote that they want Avatar (ATLA) to be a cross between games of thrones and the cartoon
[1:40:23] Kortinas: Too broke over here to buy any haha
[1:40:25] databob1: Wow it's so great Microsoft  bought Activision blizzard everything is so much better
[1:40:29] witchhobbit: i wouldn't want to get those unless i had the right storage for them
[1:40:31] atamala: xal'atath statue when??!?
[1:40:32] skeletonetiquette: Steep and unfortunately Alexstraza didn't really do the cool thing this expansion :(
[1:40:35] DiscordianKitty: I want it
[1:40:37] Dred_Scythe: Issues with production - more like who has 1k to buy one of these things to warrant the production. Statues have gotten absurd over the years.
[1:40:42] Elrathir: Nice Holly Longdale inspired statue!
[1:40:42] Derployd: I have no issue with the materials, its just overprices for those materials
[1:40:47] cosmopanda13: Talking about production issues they cited production issues about the game they cancelled. Do you believe that?
[1:40:48] Vaephera: There's a chinese company doing a (probably unlicensed) lifesize sylvanas bust for over 10k
[1:40:51] Merex760: I want a statue like that, bur Garrosh or Vol'jin
[1:40:52] rws26: How many more people microsoft lay off today?
[1:40:56] Seizure_Augustus: I have a friend whose wife buys him all the big busty Blizzard lady statues. He has both Alexstraza and Lilith. They're pretty awesome, but huge.
[1:40:57] JarJar_Brinkz: I thought the apple was included
[1:40:58] grimzero617: I'm sure she's hot. She's a dragon, after all
[1:41:01] Arlaeya: the Wrathion one was "only around $400 after fees taxes shipping, etc
[1:41:07] ImperfectDark: is that a big or small apple though
[1:41:08] jimbrown2510: Would have used a banana
[1:41:09] lykynn: lol
[1:41:11] Collected1: LUL
[1:41:15] shivena_: don't u usually use a banana for scale?
[1:41:16] skeletonetiquette: Comes with lunch
[1:41:16] thunduz: tneEvi tneEvi tneEvi
[1:41:17] nadiaaa: why not banana for scale
[1:41:19] Aakku: more of an android guy
[1:41:22] rws26: Definitely not spending 1100 on an apple ever again after seeing this buzzfeed comparison.
[1:41:23] grimzero617: Applestraza
[1:41:31] hitchmeister59: She's more than two smurfs tall.
[1:41:35] ImperfectDark: Americans using apples for measurement
[1:41:37] jimbrown2510: So alex isn´t a doctor, hence the apple
[1:41:38] Gh0stBadger: LUL
[1:41:43] thunduz: Thanks Johanna
[1:41:54] ImperfectDark: the detail is incredible tbh
[1:41:58] JarJar_Brinkz: blizz sells hockey jerseys?
[1:42:03] Efendal: americans will use anything for measurement except the metric system
[1:42:22] Arlaeya: they say they "hope" to offer it again in the future :(
[1:42:25] Hawa51: Canadians mix and match
[1:42:29] thunduz: We aren't getting great statues now because Johanna doesn't make statues!!!
[1:42:30] Collected1: spend it on mounts
[1:42:33] warrenny: @efendal yup
[1:42:34] skeletonetiquette: True
[1:42:38] databob1: I really like alexstraza's Dragon flight look it's still very hot but looks better then when she looked like she was wearing a bikini
[1:42:43] Derployd: "My apartment is 0.6 houses high"
[1:42:49] Elrathir: shoulda made a Chad Ebyssian statue instead
[1:42:57] thunduz: tneEvi
[1:43:04] atamala: what you guys dont use the apple as a measurement?  im 45 honeycrisp apples tall
[1:43:10] SphericFormula: But does she boost mythic keys
[1:43:12] siggyfisk: Aw. Give me hope Joanna
[1:43:13] Collected1: does she have mushy peas with her cod?
[1:43:14] corpas_: how many footbal fields is that alexstrasza in height?

[1:43:41] thunduz: oh
[1:43:44] dwolf010: @TaliesinAndEvitel did you see Holly's tweet responding to Matt (bellular's pal) and the shit she gets for it
[1:43:45] JoeTheRedcoat: I'm afraid that means you have to start roleplaying
[1:43:47] Darkuwa: Download att and get to work
[1:43:55] thunduz: tneTaliCry  I thought that was for WoW
[1:44:01] shivena_: booooh d4 booooh!

[1:44:23] slimgrady84: the d4 hate does seem to be bit overblown, innit?

[1:44:26] lithium364: wowhead augmentation wrap up basically : delete them, cant be balanced, cry , cry LUL
[1:44:29] skeletonetiquette: Would have liked a Khadgar statue <3 although I get he's not in the limelight
[1:44:29] thunduz: LOL Garrett was not happy that you were skipping the battle pets
[1:44:31] Big_Rum: Pirates? Did you say Pirates?
[1:44:52] rws26: @slimgrady84 Well the D4 hater-grifters actually weren't even right, the pet is actually decent.
[1:44:58] bretmanbruh: Dude that mog
[1:44:59] JarJar_Brinkz: Blizz employee existing on twitter = Getting shit from randoms

[2:14:50] CrossroadsDealer: Bangs! lol
[2:14:56] GER_Mad: "The Riddlers" sound like a family/comedy series based in Gotham LUL

[2:15:01] DozlaT: you are very puppet coded
[2:15:01] Andanole: were they blind???

[2:15:12] Anelit21: smooth
[2:15:15] atamala: were you a grizzled king of a lost kingdom of werewolves
[2:15:15] Sharktribe: I... AM STILL... EMPORER
[2:15:16] phritss: What's up @everybody
[2:15:18] gsrasslan: like... you are a flamingo or you kill them?
[2:15:19] JoeTheRedcoat: I was tabbed out I thought you mean genn greymane

[2:15:40] HSAyril: Story time
[2:15:40] gsrasslan: but
[2:15:40] witchhobbit: i loved dark crystal, it was so creepy but cool to me as a kid
[2:15:43] Sharktribe: He probably had it coming
[2:15:44] gsrasslan: how
[2:15:44] MeggoArt: is having a series of odd nicknames through your childhood a UK thing
[2:15:49] Atomicpanda: had a crush on kira as a kid
[2:16:03] maccaruso: Love the Dark Crystal.  One of my favorite movies.
[2:16:11] Dunkurk: in a bird sanctuary no less, the one place flamingos should feel safe
[2:16:13] JarJar_Brinkz: Wait.... That was real?
[2:16:14] phritss: @TaliesinAndEvitel Pirate time? Is that PST, CST?
[2:16:16] JarJar_Brinkz: Dear lord

[2:16:28] Xx_Estos_xX: ScaredyCat
[2:16:29] gsrasslan: honestly, well deserved

[2:16:42] DozlaT: what was your penance
[2:16:43] maverickll_: lol how hard was that turn to kill it
[2:16:43] Atomicpanda: birds are jerks anyway
[2:16:43] Andanole: all assassins say the same lol
[2:16:45] CrossroadsDealer: tneJellycat tneJellycat tneJellycat
[2:16:48] HSAyril: Listerine**
[2:16:54] Elrathir: @MeggoArt Ma'am no
[2:16:55] thunduz: Tali I think you missed this earlier but did you see the live action netflix avatar trailer? show comes out this month
[2:17:05] kaijoe_: Woke AND he kills flamingos?!?!
[2:17:15] Nulgar: casually admitting to a crime on stream. If I had a cent for each time I witnessed that, I'd have 2 cents, which isn't much, but it's concerning that it happened twice.
[2:17:17] gsrasslan: I mean this as the biggest compliment: You give off flamingo vibes
[2:17:18] neverbornlucky: damn now we know why Taliesin is killing those birds in the night elf starting zone
[2:17:19] JarJar_Brinkz: Avatar was my childhood, i'm hype af
[2:17:28] elbardo_ts: hey tali, have you watched netflix's live action adaptation of one piece?
[2:17:28] HSAyril: Yeah, they got rid of sokka's character development lol
[2:17:30] Atomicpanda: don't feel bad, tali, birds aren't real.
[2:17:30] dwolf010: they are ruining all the characters tho
[2:17:32] thunduz: top one
[2:17:34] Nulgar: oh THAT Avatar
[2:17:37] cosmopanda13: we keep learning more and more disappointing decisions about the direction of this show
[2:17:37] MrScotticus: Yeah, I have no interest in any Avatar adaptations
[2:17:39] neverbornlucky: Taliesin you should still watch the death strand trailer  dm'ed you
[2:17:44] JarJar_Brinkz: Its the netflix one on top
[2:17:45] Bettiold: budget lower than classic wow lmao
[2:17:47] Nulgar: was worried that Tali would be interested in the other one
[2:18:05] Atomicpanda: i can't think of anything i want to watch less than live-action avatar
[2:18:11] HSAyril: I am
[2:18:16] Yodamoo: Looks a million times better than the movie!
[2:18:19] thunduz: I just know how much you loved the animated one so wanted to see what you thought of live action
[2:18:19] goqu3D: The animated show is so good Id rather just rewatch that
[2:18:20] dwolf010: it isnt
[2:18:23] JoeTheRedcoat: Don't remake good shows, remake shows that could have been better.
[2:18:24] gefuffel: its not gonna be
[2:18:25] grimzero617: Damn they spent some money on that CGI
[2:18:30] Andanole: better than the movie I hope!!
[2:18:31] Dark_Lady_Looshkin: Money
[2:18:32] Anelit21: Like how many Dragon Ball movies came even close to manga/anime
[2:18:34] phritss: M. Night Shyamalan needs a cameo. lol
[2:18:36] mattyxoqt: original bis
[2:18:40] Sharktribe: I see it as a cool celebration of the awesome work and talent of a lot of costume designers, set dressers, lighters, etc
[2:18:42] neverbornlucky: Taliesin you can watch it with your son
[2:18:44] gefuffel: read the stuff that the showrunner are saying about some things they are changing
[2:18:45] elbardo_ts: hey tali, have you watched netflix's live action adaptation of one piece?
[2:18:47] dwolf010: they want it to be a cross between GoT and the cartoon without sexism and angs detours
[2:18:49] fat_european0: They are changing parts integral to the characters as well which is weird
[2:18:53] gefuffel: they clearly dont understand it
[2:18:55] databob1: K hear they sapatoged  Saka's  charater developement
[2:18:57] JarJar_Brinkz: I've rewatched Avatar cartoon more than 5 times, and have every comic LUL   I'm watching this shit regardless
[2:19:11] Nulgar: @dwolf010 GoT without sexism would be 10 minutes long
[2:19:16] Sharktribe: The casting is pretty good
[2:19:26] LordKurgen: talking of comic books. did you see about the Rouge Trooper movie?
[2:19:26] maccaruso: Unless Mark Hammil is back as Ozai I have no interest.
[2:19:36] Atomicpanda: it's my density
[2:19:37] witchhobbit: the best part about this live action ver is that uncle iroh is being played by paul sun-hyung lee
[2:19:41] Nulgar: tbh this looks like a fan trailer
[2:19:41] cosmopanda13: let's just say there is a reason the creators of the original avatar left the team over creative differences
[2:19:51] Reminii91: nice react stream finally
[2:19:53] fat_european0: They nailed the casting on June
[2:20:10] thunduz: watching live action remake is like playing a game remaster. just better graphics
[2:20:14] JarJar_Brinkz: Admiral Zhao Kreygasm
[2:20:16] Sharktribe: They nailed the casting on everyone
[2:20:20] HSAyril: It'll be better than Shamalamadingdong's but that's a really low bar
[2:20:21] Atomicpanda: it's definitely a thing that exists.
[2:20:23] Bambiprsi: looks appaling, really same shit as the previous movie version
[2:20:25] databob1: I'll probably  watch it
[2:20:28] Andanole: What we fight for??? Ask Chen in Pandaria!!
[2:20:29] Sorin__: a lot of the statements from interviews we're seeing are a bit weird
[2:20:33] witchhobbit: right
[2:20:34] vlaovich88: It looks shockingly good. I just wish they used it to explore a different story in the universe.
[2:20:35] goqu3D: And it wont be
[2:20:36] JarJar_Brinkz: @Bambiprsi Not at all LUL what
[2:20:37] slashpuppys: that fire lord ozai thooo ...makes me sweat
[2:20:41] TooLock: do you think 10.2.6 will be on ptr at all?
[2:20:53] Nusu1828: I've not been able to get my wife to watch the animated avatar, she'll probably watch this
[2:20:57] Xx_Estos_xX: Netflix Live action DBZ inc!
[2:20:57] Sharktribe: Ok i love ATLAB, but the MIDI music in the original series is SO awful. So is the sound mixing. It has dated so poorly.
[2:21:00] Teth33: I really don't understand why we need the same story in 4 different mediums.
[2:21:04] databob1: The casting and themeing are on point at least
[2:21:05] DiscordianKitty: wish they'd tell us what it iiiisssss
[2:21:28] thunduz: anything from blizz yet
[2:21:29] Nulgar: a vendor build is just for GPU manufacturers etc to test their drivers
[2:21:31] JarJar_Brinkz: @Sharktribe Like most things from 20 years ago LUL
[2:21:45] neverbornlucky: Taliesin check your whisper sent you a youtube trailer death stranding 2
[2:21:50] thunduz: we haven't missed it yet have we?
[2:21:52] alexandrunst: wait, Holly was here?? did i miss that?

[2:21:59] MeggoArt: rev up that bass boosted boralus theme
[2:22:02] DiscordianKitty: holy shit holly was here?
[2:22:04] phritss: I would be surprised if they release it along side SOD, but it is a possibility.
[2:22:16] funviking99: KomodoHype
[2:22:17] thunduz: oh yeah what happened to the bet?
[2:22:22] doomer_dan_: holly is a bad ass
[2:22:24] elbardo_ts: maybe in an hour, right?
[2:22:25] MeggoArt: it's probably gonna be at 1pm EST/10am PST then
[2:22:34] chelfx: @elbardo_ts yes one hour
[2:22:38] Dunkurk: turns out the patch is just a microsoft corssover with sea of thieves bringing sea of thieves cosmetics to wow and wow cosmetics to sea of thieves, i would cry

[2:23:24] Atomicpanda: pirates
[2:23:25] doomer_dan_: just started mythic amirdrassil progression with my guild last night. got the first three down and it was so much fun
[2:23:29] KyleS07: The devs being excited about what they're going to reveal makes me excited. Hopefully its really good
[2:23:32] Nusu1828: if they had a good vamp survivors in wow, I'd be in trouble
[2:23:33] dotonbori: I'd really hate some sort of in-game mini game thing
[2:23:39] Nusu1828: I think I played vampire survivors more than wow in 2023
[2:23:48] Nusu1828: and I played a lot of wow
[2:23:51] Popicus: Player Housing: Boat Edition
[2:24:04] slashpuppys: understandable
[2:24:04] Bettiold: it will be one mount from 5 minute quest line lmao
[2:24:06] MrGM: There was 2 scenescripts but 1 got deleted or encrypted in a recent build
[2:24:19] mattyxoqt: ok but whats the pirate flag thing
[2:24:19] neverbornlucky: Taliesin we thought  that diablo4 vaults were going to be rogue likeg ame modes look how wrong we were there
[2:24:30] LordKurgen: so Pirate survivors?
[2:24:32] GER_Mad: i think that that Vampire Survival thing will be like the Plants vs Zombies thing in Hillsbrad. some very small quest maybe
[2:24:34] KyleS07: Player housing and pirates
[2:24:47] MrGM: there was quite a lot of data in them

[2:24:56] PidiaP: Can we all agree to fight the pirates in our Sailor Moon outfits!??
[2:25:03] bottis96: If you need something to do clean your bags out and let us know what we don't need any more.
[2:25:06] lithium364: the community wishes for too much tho, like rogue pirate support spec or an nightsquall raid
[2:25:06] MrGM: I think you're right
[2:25:24] DiscordianKitty: pirate housing
[2:25:31] fat_european0: @TaliesinAndEvitel do you think it'll be bigger or smaller than the average .5/.7 patches?
[2:25:32] dwolf010: if Feasel teases it it has to be a evergreen system
[2:25:41] Atomicpanda: if i wanted experimenting i'd go back to college
[2:25:43] MrGM: I heard its the account-wide transmog collection early 100% confirmed

[2:26:23] slashpuppys: islands expeditions without the timer would be fire
[2:26:23] Ethersan: maybe... all old raids soloable?
[2:26:27] Lacee666: retail hardcore leveling servers
[2:26:35] Atomicpanda: islands were fun. people just grinded them until they weren't fun anymore
[2:26:37] ebrahim_91: ITS SYLVANAS
[2:26:39] neverbornlucky: Taliesin give me my japanese school girl skirt transmog already so I can sailor scout cosplay in wow. We all want to be Sailor Moon after this trading post
[2:26:39] MrGM: housing isn't a big word
[2:26:48] KyleS07: Could be a single huge feature
[2:26:48] DozlaT: on our customizable pirate boats??
[2:26:49] Nulgar: would indeed be nice if we got a small preview of Warbands, or more class/race combos
[2:26:50] Saiyori: you can do islands now
[2:26:50] phritss: The patch allows hunters to duel wield bows.

[3:01:32] brennibrennt: These ary typical symptoms of an addiction. You fully know it's not good, but you need the chemical reactions in your brain.
[3:01:40] caradosailanthus: @HSAyril Yeah if it was made to just be cosmetic, that could work around it
[3:01:44] Sharktribe: @AlanC2024 the dwarf city on the surface is the city
[3:02:03] neverbornlucky: Taliesin mobile games are addiction

[3:03:21] ravenstarr: agreed
[3:03:23] gsrasslan: Mcdonald's does have some decent burgers. The cheeseburger is not one of them
[3:03:28] grimzero617: It's tasty. The lab designed it that way
[3:03:32] boomshroom: Honest Burger
[3:03:32] Atomicpanda: five guys good
[3:03:33] Sarkans41: never said "high cuisine" just if the burger was actually bad you wouldnt eat it.  Its just not anything special
[3:03:33] mattyxoqt: its delicious trash
[3:03:37] thunduz: 5 guys destroys me but it’s so good

[3:04:14] JakeSezz: You know how, sometimes, in your younger days how there’d be a person that you’d be like “Oi I don’t think I should hook up with that person, but it’ll be dirty fun”? That’s a McDonalds burger mrgmHehe tneTali
[3:04:15] aeson_of_raid_sock: secret sauce is great but they need better quality burgers
[3:04:19] Yodamoo: Did you hear abotu all the big changes they are planning at McDonald's in 2024?

[3:04:34] Unciatim: whataburger is trash as well... don't be fooled
[3:04:38] grimzero617: Whataburger is only good for taquitos when drunk and we all know it
[3:04:39] bubbleonia_rising: I'll do everything in WoW except M+. Doing the same thing over and over for incremental gains I can't really use because my guild does normal raiding is not compelling (to me).
[3:04:43] khalcrux_gaming: The best turd is a pizza

[3:05:10] Andanole: oops...keyboard changed language sorry
[3:05:11] aeson_of_raid_sock: don’t let this distract you from the fact they call a chicken sandwich a chicken burger
[3:05:12] gryffiest: objectively bad food
[3:05:23] Sarkans41: why compare a mcdonalds cheeseburger to a five guys theyre two very different things.  For simple cheap burgers McDs makes good burgers.  Now if we're talking gourmet burgers its a different story.
[3:05:25] Garysteel1984: deep fried mars bar Kreygasm
[3:05:28] Andanole: my cats can make a better burger than the Mac
[3:05:33] CeasiusPls: no, their nuggets are terrible
[3:05:41] frankenfoot5: I usually only eat McDonald's when I'm driving long hours cross country (USA)
[3:05:43] CeasiusPls: now KFC poppers
[3:05:45] Honorbound94: @TaliesinAndEvitel Cookout nuggs are the best. Beats all others
[3:05:45] JakeSezz: I think their nuggs are the worst thing on their menu mrgmO After the McRib, natch
[3:05:49] khalcrux_gaming: The bread is all it takes in America
[3:05:49] hitchmeister59: McD is great when you want something cheap and familiar.
[3:05:55] Nulgar: lol, got the Fedora
[3:05:59] ravenstarr: What's a UK sandwich?
[3:05:59] ShadowDragon14855: what is a sandwich in the UK?
[3:06:13] neverbornlucky: Taliesin have you ever tried chicken and waffles ?

[3:06:40] gsrasslan: there's nothing wrong with liking bad stuff. Life is too short to hate on bad stuff that makes you happy
[3:06:52] frankenfoot5: Five Guys is really overpriced and always makes me sick to my stomach. So, I genuinely prefer Mickey D's over 5G

[3:07:32] ShadowDragon14855: ok fair
[3:07:33] witchhobbit: 5guys has cajun fries and mix ins for milkshakes which is the win
[3:07:39] bubbleonia_rising: Technically, a slice of bread in between two slices of bread is a sandwich, but no one would ever call it that.
[3:07:39] ravenstarr: Does a filling have to be a spread?
[3:07:41] Sarkans41: I guess I just dont compare things that are clearly not trying to compete against each other.

[3:08:03] TownieTV: In America donuts are breakfast too
[3:08:05] DiscordianKitty: unserious country

[3:08:41] d__hizzle: we don’t call burgers sandwiches at all. the name burger comes from the meat
[3:08:41] frankenfoot5: Don't the Irish classify most USA bread as desserts because we put so much sugary crap in ours?
[3:08:47] Hexakord: talli trollin
[3:08:48] Deatheran: @TaliesinAndEvitel im prety sure its like one small part of the US that calls them sandwiches

[3:09:34] AlanC2024: I had a chicken burger as take out the other day. Cornwall btw

[3:09:38] brennibrennt: Tali's anti americanism going rampant with the sandwich lies Kappa
[3:09:39] ravenstarr: chicken burger sounds weird, since a burger is usually ground meat in the states.
[3:09:45] JMcGhee559: I call basically anything between 2 other things a sandwich

[3:10:00] khalcrux_gaming: <<<'merican. People do. They say it both ways. He is and can make a generalization.

[3:10:10] Mazerbeam: No one uses sandwich for burger.
[3:10:12] FoxFire720: but do PIRATES eat burger?!
[3:10:16] OILTIME: @TaliesinAndEvitel Define sandwich
[3:10:16] JMcGhee559: @Mazerbeam i do.
[3:10:17] frankenfoot5: The USA is so big, we have different names for the same stuff depending on where you are. Another example is what people call Soda/Pop/Coke/Fizzy Drink etc.
[3:10:20] MeggoArt: in the US a chicken burger would mean a ground chicken patty - i guess we only think about the meat that's in it
[3:10:21] Hexakord: most americans do not call burgers sandwiches, but some do
[3:10:24] mydemoncat: americans call hamburgers "burgers"

[3:11:12] Xanctius: @TaliesinAndEvitel Why is it called a hamburger, even though its not ham
[3:11:17] Andanole: IN GREECE A BURGER IS A BURGER LIKE CHEESEEBURGER AND A SANDWICH 2 PIECES OF BREAD THAT YOU PUT BETWEEN THEM WHATEVER YOU WANT

[3:13:14] X_barley: @TaliesinAndEvitel I almost guarantee you could find branding of a US chain calling beef burger a sandwhich
[3:13:15] Angel_Ink: its called a burger at kfc here
[3:13:16] thunduz: that's silly
[3:13:29] Durwen: chicken burger. I ate one today.
[3:13:34] d__hizzle: I’d allow a minced chicken patty being a chicken burger. 😂
[3:13:34] alextheblight: true
[3:13:34] Bambiprsi: in decemeber first popeyes opened in CZ, and its super weird to everyone here that they are calling their chicken burgers "sandwiches"
[3:13:37] boomshroom: hence..veggie burgers
[3:13:39] neverbornlucky: Taliesin you should  google KFC donut chicken sandwhich
[3:13:39] sandpigeon: sounds good makes sense
[3:13:41] grimzero617: Ah... OK I misunderstood
[3:13:44] farthammerr: i'm going to keep asking - patty melt? where does it fall?
[3:13:46] hitchmeister59: A burrito is a sandwich.
[3:13:47] thunduz: I see that logic but I can not accept this truth
[3:13:49] grimzero617: It's a sandwich
[3:13:51] bottis96: Meat Burger???
[3:13:52] atamala: pretty sure burger in the us is when it uses ground meat
[3:13:52] grimzero617: Freedom
[3:13:52] Dunkurk: if its on a brioche or sesame seed bun its a burger
[3:13:52] gulrakrurs: I think we call it a sandwich because it sounds  'healthier '
[3:13:53] Garysteel1984: What do American's call a butty? HahaThink
[3:13:57] AlanC2024: I had a chicken burger from a takeaway last week. Can confirm
[3:13:57] Deatheran: @TaliesinAndEvitel to make matters wierd, they call BEEF patties HAMburgers
[3:13:57] Nulgar: it's not a real burger unless it's made from real people in Hamburg
[3:13:59] Arlaeya: yet we call a turkey burger a burger... we make no sense. now what do you call a hero/sub/hoagie?
[3:13:59] Thowarr: Because only Americans use the proper terms
[3:13:59] aeson_of_raid_sock: a burrito is not a sandwich
[3:14:02] frankenfoot5: Yeah, a turkey burger is a regular burger with a turkey patty instead. Not a turkey and swiss melt
[3:14:05] stonespetty: Chicken Sandwich
[3:14:07] soragrey: sandwich. burger if it is using a patty shape, there are chicken patties
[3:14:09] witchhobbit: so it's the buns that make it a burger?
[3:14:11] Mazerbeam: Burger came from Hamburger which is a sandwich with a beef patty. One could argue you need beef for it to be a burger.
[3:14:13] Durwen: shaped like a burger, it is a burger
[3:14:18] warrenny: burger is a sandwhich english
[3:14:19] Thowarr: Oxford Dictionary def of sandwich: /ˈsænwɪtʃ/, /ˈsænwɪdʒ/ (also British English, informal sarnie) two slices of bread, often spread with butter, with a layer of meat, cheese, etc. between them.
[3:14:20] Sarkans41: now I want a chicken sammy
[3:14:20] neverbornlucky: Taliesin look at KFC donut chicken sandwhich
[3:14:23] 03eltond: well put a beef patty on all sandwiches and then we can all agree they are all burgers
[3:14:26] the_howlermonkey: so the shape of the bread determines the burger
[3:14:29] sandpigeon: yeah in america we'll say turkey burger or impossible burger, but for some reason don't say chicken burger
[3:14:30] atamala: cause we do have chicken burgers in the us but it's with ground chicken
[3:14:32] SquiggySquonk: is a hot dog a burger?
[3:14:33] boomshroom: nah man...they are sandwich buns
[3:14:35] Its_Big_Tone: they call it a sanwhich in amsterdam! haha
[3:14:35] AlanC2024: In America all burgers are Sandwiches but not all Sandwiches are burgers. That kind of deal
[3:14:35] alextheblight: what about "patty"?
[3:14:35] farthammerr: so a patty melt is a sandwich?
[3:14:39] aeson_of_raid_sock: but a chicken burger here would be ground chicken
[3:14:41] witchhobbit: yeah now i want fast food
[3:14:44] 3Duxie: I think its a HOT DOG
[3:14:46] the_howlermonkey: i hate that, and the US is right... GO MURCA!!!
[3:14:47] X_barley: Oddly if its some healthy alternative to beef like turkey meat or Tuna we still call it a burger
[3:14:50] aeson_of_raid_sock: which exists
[3:14:52] thunduz: A hotdog is a sandwich
[3:14:52] horngano: If I put a burger bun on top of your head, will you become a burger?
[3:14:53] farthammerr: CHECK MATE
[3:14:56] MrScotticus: Is a sub a sandwich?
[3:14:57] alextheblight: wait no, "patty" is the meat
[3:14:58] d__hizzle: Is a chip butty a sandwich
[3:14:58] atamala: per your definition it is though
[3:14:59] ravenstarr: Its on bread.
[3:14:59] OILTIME: @TaliesinAndEvitel What about the double down
[3:15:00] atamala: lol
[3:15:00] Lukkelol: is cereal a soup?
[3:15:02] mattyxoqt: thats a chip butty
[3:15:02] TownieTV: Toasties ftw
[3:15:03] RosieSeren: isn't that a toastie?
[3:15:03] skibbers: chips or fries?
[3:15:04] soragrey: what about a panani
[3:15:04] Vyldaen: 23.
[3:15:05] grimzero617: I'd call it a patty melt
[3:15:06] ravenstarr: lol
[3:15:07] thunduz: So a sloppy joe is a burger?!
[3:15:09] Mazerbeam: Is a Sloppy Joe a burger?
[3:15:09] alextheblight: hmm
[3:15:10] neverbornlucky: Taliesin are we ignoring the KFC donut chicken sandwhich ?
[3:15:10] manmower: what about hotdog in a burger bun?
[3:15:11] DiscordianKitty: Now you have to tell them what chips are
[3:15:11] Deatheran: @TaliesinAndEvitel the US is the only place where a HAMburger only references a BEEF patty and nothing else
[3:15:12] KatieRet_: patty melt is a meat toastie
[3:15:13] khalcrux_gaming: I find it strange the fancier sounding fillet is the American way of saying it
[3:15:14] QuarianHips: hot dog is a taco
[3:15:16] iRegretn0thing: No, its a warm canine.
[3:15:17] farthammerr: i live for this kind of debate
[3:15:19] d__hizzle: is a chip butty a sandwich Tali?
[3:15:21] Thowarr: Hot dog is: two slices of bread with meat inbetween - sandwixch
[3:15:21] MeggoArt: quesadilla is a sandwich
[3:15:21] farthammerr: thank you for this
[3:15:22] crazedking45: ...Hot Dog is just an American Polish Sandwich
[3:15:23] Dunkurk: where do we land on crispy rolls tho, are they their own category or are tthey sandwhiches and if you put a burger patty on a crispy roll is it a burger or a roll and meatt?
[3:15:24] Angel_Ink: americans have meatballs in a hotdog bread and they call that a sandwich too
[3:15:25] aeson_of_raid_sock: if you were between me and my wife is that a burger or a sandwich?
[3:15:27] hitchmeister59: Patty melt is made with sliced bread.
[3:15:28] Atomicpanda: a hotdog is a hotdog. a taco is a sandwich
[3:15:29] atamala: @Deatheran turkey burger? impossible burger?
[3:15:30] thunduz: love me a good sloppy joe
[3:15:42] backflash69: What Bout subway's? Sandwiches?
[3:15:45] frankenfoot5: Hey Tali, genuinely always been curious. Does the UK have good Mexican food? Or Latin American food?
[3:15:46] Thowarr: It's not a debate because the British Oxford Dictionary says Tali is wrong
[3:15:46] Tahalamaius: a patty melt is a panini
[3:15:51] warrenny: isnt sloppy joe an american thing?
[3:15:52] Quackster27: fucking hilarious, mericas dumb
[3:15:53] TheSonicDwarf: if sloppy joe is a burger, then so is a grilled cheese sandwich
[3:15:54] chelfx: 10 minutes till news
[3:15:57] atamala: lets just blame the germans from hamburg who immigrated to the US and call it a day
[3:16:03] dAnKscOOter69: tell us more! whats tea and crumpets
[3:16:09] X_barley: 10.2.6 drop to save us from the sandwhich deniers
[3:16:11] DozlaT: mm burger
[3:16:12] Oliraptor: *stares at ocean waiting for ships* X]
[3:16:14] Nusu1828: traditional english vs simplified english
[3:16:20] grimzero617: Only hamburgers are burgers. USA, USA lol
[3:16:21] TownieTV: I'd like everyone to take a moment to picture a football sandwich.
[3:16:26] Mazerbeam: I call it food and if I think about it any longer I'm just going to be hungry and my burgwich is going to get cold!
[3:16:27] Phillight: we're just angry all the time
[3:16:29] Angel_Ink: If i ordered a sandwich and i got that, i would be very disapointed
[3:16:29] mattyxoqt: they wrong tho
[3:16:31] aeson_of_raid_sock: I think sandwich is sort of like automobile. you’ve got different types that fall under that
[3:16:33] khalcrux_gaming: America is basically the world but you didn't hear that from me. lol
[3:16:39] chelfx: Canada is the same way with UK
[3:16:40] RavaTroll: In France we'd say this is a burger
[3:16:40] Nusu1828: the cube rule :D
[3:16:41] AlanC2024: In UK a chicken sandwich is sliced roast chicken or chicken chunks between 2 slices
[3:16:42] TheSonicDwarf: burgers are sandwiches though
[3:16:44] TiredZubat: nah im hungry now
[3:16:45] zinfar: burgers are just a subcategory of sandwiches with specific requirements of the buns?
[3:16:45] witchhobbit: BURGWICH
[3:16:48] neverbornlucky: Taliesin plz google KFC donut chicken sandwhich
[3:16:48] OILTIME: one food please
[3:16:49] Thowarr: Dude, the Brits can't pronounce half their words so it's not a debate
[3:16:51] alextheblight: oh shit, I'm hungry now
[3:16:52] warrenny: americans like getting english wrong
[3:16:53] Sorin__: 1 food unit please
[3:16:54] Phillight: southerners call all soda "coke"
[3:16:56] magemaster225: yes Ill have the default
[3:16:56] grimzero617: They don't have food at McDonald's
[3:17:00] KyleS07: sangwidges?
[3:17:03] Dunkurk: If you walk into mcdoanlds and ask for food they usually say they dont do food here
[3:17:05] dwolf010: 9 mins
[3:17:05] Saiyori: oen food, please
[3:17:06] OILTIME: @TaliesinAndEvitel That is how we order in the united states. Some times we just grunt
[3:17:06] gsrasslan: as a former cashier at McD, that's not irregular
[3:17:07] TheSonicDwarf: @Sorin__  lol
[3:17:09] TiredZubat: burgwich
[3:17:11] khalcrux_gaming: No they say we don't have food here.
[3:17:11] KainhNZ: all I want is a smurf LUL
[3:17:13] 03eltond: no no you give them a number for the value meal of which food you want
[3:17:16] Mazerbeam: No I don't go to a McDonalds. That would be your first mistake
[3:17:16] frankenfoot5: Tali, I need to know. Does the UK have authentic latin american food?
[3:17:20] RavaTroll: Burg witches ?
[3:17:20] Nusu1828: mcdonald's doesn't even call half their bugers burgers, they're big macs and quarter pounders
[3:17:23] JakeSezz: @phillight Hey! Some of us call it ‘pop’, like civilized folk mrgmO tneTali
[3:17:25] witchhobbit: i'll take a food please
[3:17:28] chelfx: There isa guy in USA that eats Bigmac every day
[3:17:29] Nulgar: it's not food, it's food*
[3:17:38] boomshroom: nah, a sandburg
[3:17:38] Tahalamaius: id like one food please
[3:17:43] aeson_of_raid_sock: boomers yes
[3:17:43] Khadir84: Americans do that with sodas.  Some call it all coke or Pop, or whatever, and soemtimes they mean Coke,  and sometimes they mean a pepsi when they say coke
[3:17:43] Sorin__: i dunno people have been pretty rude to me
[3:17:45] d__hizzle: Tali, why do American pizzas in the UK have corn on them 🤢
[3:17:47] Sharktribe: True, Americans are so rude and entitled. We treat workers so badly
[3:17:49] Hexakord: *sigh*
[3:17:52] iRegretn0thing: BIG true
[3:17:56] Angel_Ink: Risky being rude to ppl that handle your food?
[3:17:58] hitchmeister59: That's cause we pay them, bot the shop.
[3:17:58] Deatheran: @TaliesinAndEvitel its tipping culture making people believe servers have to be thier slaves or else they wont tip
[3:18:00] TheSonicDwarf: our citizens are spoiled entitled children
[3:18:01] GrAiNGrInDeR: God, yeah it's horrible
[3:18:03] DozlaT: i hate ppl that are rude to folks in the service industry
[3:18:04] RosieSeren: nothing is as cringe as being rude to waiststaff or retail
[3:18:04] OILTIME: Burger me now
[3:18:08] Sorin__: generally the most rude people have just been really old
[3:18:11] KatieRet_: me too LUL
[3:18:12] blitzkriegb0mb: @phillight No, SOME Southerns call soda/cola coke. No one I know does so. Depends on the state...
[3:18:13] AlanC2024: I am the same way LD
[3:18:13] frankenfoot5: Yeah in the USA the customers are rude to the staff. In France the staff are rude to the customers.
[3:18:14] 3Duxie: DID YOU MEAN BURGER?
[3:18:28] X_barley: My favorite thing we do in America is the Hey, hows it going? and then we just never respond
[3:18:28] gsrasslan: I've only had 1 person say "do you know who I am?" while I was serving them. He was an american in jorts and a t-shirt
[3:18:31] alexandrunst: tneEvi
[3:18:33] thunduz: tneEvi tneEvi tneEvi tneEvi
[3:18:34] iRegretn0thing: Mmmmm cum burger
[3:18:35] QuarianHips: An american restaurant out of ketchup?!
[3:18:35] Nusu1828: I am not rude, but I sure wish the fast food places could at least get my order right, even when I place orders using apps
[3:18:50] zinfar: that’s part of why we are obligated to tip, to make up for that.
[3:18:51] frankenfoot5: Tali I think it's a generational thing. Millennials are how you are. Gen X and Boomers are wayyyy ruder on average
[3:18:52] 03eltond: generalizing the US is dicey, people's attitudes vary wildly based on city, region, etc
[3:18:55] funviking99: true
[3:18:55] crazedking45: HA!
[3:18:56] d__hizzle: I was a server in Alabama and it sucked
[3:18:56] slashpuppys: Because their customer service need to be so fucking friendly otherwise they get fired. in europe we can talk back when people are rude
[3:18:57] brennibrennt: And now in Welsh accent Kappa
[3:18:58] revan4686: @taliesinandevitel  have u seen hollys twitter ?
[3:18:58] crazedking45: No
[3:19:00] SphericFormula: They treat service staff like the object between them and what they want
[3:19:00] Thowarr: @frankenfoot5 Listen, it's only Americans who are rude. It's fucking paradise on the rest of the planet
[3:19:03] manmower: americans are polite drivers at least
[3:19:14] atamala: generalizations dont make friends lol. ive met really rude people from everywhere
[3:19:16] Sorin__: i think being indignant about someone replacing your ketchup with cum might not be "rude"
[3:19:17] Dunkurk: the problem come swhen you wlk into a fast food place and find yourself tahnking the order kiosk computer
[3:19:20] KyleS07: Americans are the WORST drivers
[3:19:23] ravenstarr: which parts of the US do you typically visit?
[3:19:25] FatCatDad48: That's because in America people in service jobs are looked down on because they don't have "real" jobs
[3:19:27] KamkazeV2: What part of America? It is kind of massive after all
[3:19:29] markaud23: lmao polite drivers
[3:19:34] jhopps12: omg this is making me want popeyes
[3:19:37] khalcrux_gaming: Take it back! If I wanted something your thumb touched I'd eat the inside of your ear!
[3:19:38] warrenny: thats why thing i dont understand why American think ppl should have to live off tips
[3:19:42] Thoreya: florida dont got polite drivers LUL
[3:19:45] bubbleonia_rising: I'm American AF and we have bad drivers and customers, generally.
[3:19:46] JMcGhee559: I'm genX and having worked in a bunch of service industries when I was young I am probably overly nice & polite to people
[3:19:46] Ciek: yeah it seems to be mostly generational in america too
[3:19:48] TheDeekins: marcheGUN
[3:19:48] Thowarr: Oh, GENERALLY Brits are more likely to come colonize your land for the next 200 years
[3:19:49] Nusu1828: I wish drivers in america would have to go to germany to qualify for driver's licenses
[3:19:51] 03eltond: the US is huge though. its so hard to generalize the US
[3:19:53] aeson_of_raid_sock: we have much wider roads so we don’t need to be good drivers
[3:19:55] ravenstarr: Regions vary a fair bit, given how large the country is.
[3:20:01] frankenfoot5: Tali, I've been thinking of moving out of the US, and I need to know. Does the UK have Latin American food? I need my pupusas and burritos
[3:20:02] Deatheran: im getting hungry time to go eat air and watter brb
[3:20:02] manmower: gun laws in america were to protect us from the british
[3:20:02] slashpuppys: @Thowarr no brit will disagree with ya
[3:20:03] khalcrux_gaming: No a small amount of mostly the wrong people own the guns.
[3:20:07] KyleS07: Tipping is idiotic and I wish we could stop it in the US
[3:20:07] literally_human_garbage: in my experience as an american worker who has had to serve the general public, americans are TERRIBLE customers
[3:20:28] d__hizzle: Mexican food doesn’t exist in the UK 😂
[3:20:28] pernvandamme: The tip thing is based on our racist past and the Restaurant Association
[3:20:29] bubbleonia_rising: yeah, dealbreaker
[3:20:30] khalcrux_gaming: No. They absolutely do not.
[3:20:39] atamala: owning guns is objective, where is the study or research that shows americans are more likely to be rude?  you're stating it like it's a fact, but it's anectodal
[3:20:39] Mazerbeam: I'm much happier when ordering food outside the states because I know I'm not adding an extra 20% at the end of the meal :D
[3:20:39] KyleS07: Oh I agree.
[3:20:40] frankenfoot5: Welp, that's a dealbreaker. I'm sorry Tali.
[3:20:43] CeasiusPls: UK has great indian food and also Nandos
[3:20:44] Thoreya: bartenders cash out on tips
[3:20:45] bubbleonia_rising: no Mexican good, no go (to live)
[3:20:45] Thowarr: GENERALLY Brits are going to strip all your most valuable cultural relics and never give them back
[3:20:45] khalcrux_gaming: We don't pay a living wage for those jobs
[3:20:46] jhopps12: it's not idiotic if the business are underpaying tir staf
[3:20:50] KyleS07: Your phrasing is much better
[3:20:54] Deatheran: @TaliesinAndEvitel its disgusting that they cant pay their servers and make us do it on charity basis
[3:20:55] Thoreya: depending on area ofc
[3:20:55] neverbornlucky: Taliesin plz plz plz Google KFC donut chicken sandwhich
[3:20:58] JakeSezz: I’m THISCLOSE to moving to England and opening an American-style BBQ pub/restaurant
[3:21:01] sScottyKarate: @jhopps12 thats the idiotic part
[3:21:04] blitzkriegb0mb: @pernvandamme Exactly
[3:21:09] skeletonetiquette: We're paying employees who should be paid by their employer
[3:21:15] brennibrennt: Tipping is another symptom of the system we discussed plenty of times here :D
[3:21:17] khalcrux_gaming: We're gonna have a trillionair soon
[3:21:22] kiewies: Most Americans think you shouldn't tip because you just disagree w tipping
[3:21:23] AlanC2024: Honestly in the uk sometimes the quality of food depends on the town or village you live in. I have a great Fish and Chips but a bad Kebab shop
[3:21:25] bubbleonia_rising: right, it's us or them people
[3:21:35] khalcrux_gaming: Tax the rich. Eat the wealthy.
[3:21:35] KainhNZ: automatic tip for mediocre service, when I'm a low maintenance customer = no thanks :|
[3:21:36] X_barley: Tbf its not even someone serving you always, it's like an ipad flip or even something automated
[3:21:37] Deatheran: all because employer wants to make stonks go up
[3:21:43] KyleS07: I'd pay more for my meal if I didn't have to tip.
[3:21:48] hitchmeister59: Americans won't go to a place with no tipping but 25% higher prices, if there's someplace else with lower prices, but you're expected to tip.
[3:22:04] Thoreya: mom and pop restaurants would suffer a lot if they had to pay their workers a lot
[3:22:10] d__hizzle: you need to tip atleast 15%, and not over stay at your table
[3:22:11] Kortinas: Its sad
[3:22:12] KainhNZ: also: Canadian, not American
[3:22:14] Saiyori: most boomers say "that will teach them to serve better" to not tip and i hate it
[3:22:14] Thowarr: Lol, they put cum in your burger instead of ketchum: def gonna tip!
[3:22:14] witchhobbit: i don't like going to restaurants at all anymore but just ordering takeout with uber eats isn't that much better
[3:22:17] Deatheran: @TaliesinAndEvitel that is where the nastyness to servers comes from. "be my servant or i wont tip"
[3:22:20] thunduz: which confuses me because when we were in london they told us they didn't do tips
[3:22:23] loki_a: but you paid for the food already?
[3:22:25] Angel_Ink: the pay lvl in america is very low
[3:22:27] Nulgar: but it is "voting with your wallet" /s
[3:22:27] Tenkula: what do they pay you to have us staring at these burgers all the time ..
[3:22:27] witchhobbit: i hate the whole system
[3:22:38] neverbornlucky: Taliesin will you plz google KFC donut chicken sandwhich
[3:22:41] sScottyKarate: why would i pay for shit service?
[3:22:43] warrenny: heres a crazy idea; pay a living wage
[3:22:45] random_redshirt: American tipping is terrible, because it's used to make up the wages that should be paid by their employers.  Federal tipped minimum wage is $2.13/hour, and the business only has to make up the difference between that and federal minimum wage if tips don't cover it.
[3:22:51] ravenstarr: what regions of the US have you visited?
[3:22:52] AlanC2024: Asmongold did a similar video today yesterday. He agrees that tipping is wrong and that they need to pay waiter / waitresses more
[3:22:53] TownieTV: In my experience, I very rarely got bad service by treating serving staff as human beings. If you are shit to someone, they're probably going to respond in kind.
[3:23:00] Nulgar: @loki_a but you didn't pay for it to be delivered to your table
[3:23:02] Trebled_Mind: had a friend who over tipped on his first drink, closed out, then came back and got another drink and didn’t tip. when the bartender asked if something was wrong with his drink he said “no you’re fine” then came back to us and called her a bitch behind her back for “embarrassing him”. it was such incel behavior I hated what he did.
[3:23:04] Thoreya: 3 minutes!
[3:23:06] Sharktribe: Be upset at the employers, who extract value from their workers and don't compensate them properly, and cause us to pay them for them
[3:23:08] Yodamoo: I tip should be for good service, not because it's how they get paid...the point of tipping should be to incentivize good service
[3:23:08] gsrasslan: Shit service is still service
[3:23:11] rushof90: no way they get a tip if they suck ass
[3:23:11] viirracocha: did the announcement come out?
[3:23:15] Thowarr: @TaliesinAndEvitel do you tip at McDonalds?
[3:23:16] Saiyori: some peopel do lollol
[3:23:19] sScottyKarate: yes i do i return it
[3:23:21] funviking99: isnt the service price already included in the price?
[3:23:23] caradosailanthus: Any time minimum wage comes up here, comments about "burger flippers" come up, so yeah it's all about superiority and looking down on service people
[3:23:24] sScottyKarate: if its cold im not paying for cold food
[3:23:29] Nusu1828: you don't tip at mickey d's
[3:23:31] KatieRet_: restaurants in america are simply more expensive because they have an extra charge, that's the fault of shit pay but is the way it is
[3:23:35] Yodamoo: Yes I do...I would never pay for poor quality food...at least get them to remake it properly
[3:23:35] Mazerbeam: I don't tip at coffee shops
[3:23:37] boubotte: when you go to the movies and pay a ticket and the movie is shit, you still paid for it
[3:23:42] loki_a: that's the way we apply it here tho right, if they do bad service, no tip
[3:23:46] rushof90: no but you don’t tip McDonald’s
[3:23:46] george_davis95: thats because you knowingly purchase the shit food, aware of its shitness
[3:23:47] RosieSeren: bad service or bad food, I'd still always pay but just never go back
[3:23:47] KyleS07: Everyone has bad days. Not tipping is messed up
[3:23:50] witchhobbit: same
[3:23:52] george_davis95: you expect good service
[3:23:55] DiscordianKitty: I'm calling you wrong and bad
[3:23:57] placeholdername33: I suck at my job and I still get paid for it. Should apply to service workers as well
[3:24:01] drax1957: Dictionary Definitions from Oxford Languages · Learn more burg·er /ˈbərɡər/ noun a dish consisting of a round patty of ground beef, or sometimes another savory ingredient, that is fried or grilled and typically served in a split bun or roll with various condiments and toppings. "Tilly had a burger and fries" a round patty of a savory ingredient, typically ground beef. "I grilled the burgers for 5 minutes per side" lol
[3:24:02] manmower: what about tipping for self-service places?
[3:24:03] Nusu1828: but tipping restauarants yes. tip like you need to
[3:24:08] brennibrennt: I think we would have to define "bad service"
[3:24:08] khalcrux_gaming: Why delivery drivers are private contractors. They deny non tipped orders and people get pissed. If you don't like it they shouldn't be private contractors they should be employees and get a living wage.
[3:24:12] KainhNZ: I hate that Canada servers expect automatic tipping, where the min wage is SIGNIFICANTLY higher than in USA
[3:24:15] sScottyKarate: then get another job where you're not miserable to people who you need money from?
[3:24:15] chico_escuela: people that don’t tip never spent a second working in any service job
[3:24:17] KyleS07: $4.25/hour is usually the average pay for servers.
[3:24:17] Its_Big_Tone: you cant compare mcdonalds to a regular restaurant tho, if you are going to sit down and eat, i guess we expect a higher level of service. and thats what we tip based on. Def flawed but in the nicer restaurants waiters make GREAT money
[3:24:17] frankenfoot5: I tip 15-20% always. It's not my fault the system is what it is
[3:24:19] X_barley: I think there's been a major decrease in tipping cause now the customer can barely afford a tip if at all
[3:24:19] loki_a: no but that's backwards, originally it was because we appreciated their service - they corrupted the concept, no?
[3:24:20] Yodamoo: I think you have that backwards
[3:24:22] boubotte: i'd provide bad service too if i was paid like crap 💀
[3:24:28] funviking99: not tipping is ok,   I don’t do it that much because I need money too LUL
[3:24:36] sandpigeon: the dictionary follows usage, not the other way around
[3:24:36] Sharktribe: I lived in Tokyo for 2 years, people there are deeply insulted if you attempt to tip them- since it implies they would work at a place that doesn't value their work
[3:24:37] thunduz: I 96% of the time tip but if someone is extremely rude to me I'm not going to.
[3:24:42] HeyheyReirei: exactly. words are embodied by the individual
[3:24:44] kiewies: I always tip 18%-20% even if bad service.
[3:24:44] X_barley: almost 10 PST 👀
[3:24:45] lonesomecowboy: i mean if everyone stopped tipping, employers would 100 percent still pay completely horrible wages so like i kinda dont have a choice you gotta tip dude lo
[3:24:47] rilozeta: this is fun discourse
[3:24:55] aeson_of_raid_sock: we have fun
[3:24:57] Toiarc: If you eat burger everyday then there is somekind of unhealthy thing about it and you dont get enough multiple different nutritions from all short of different foods and feel tired all times.
[3:24:57] bubbleonia_rising: I tip 15% baseline no matter what because that is how they get paid thanks to bad laws, policies and regulations. Great tips get up to 25%, and everyone gets treated like a proper human being, baseline.
[3:25:00] warrenny: english here its both
[3:25:01] Yodamoo: Tipping has been turned into what you're saying, but it's not how tipping started and should be done
[3:25:02] frankenfoot5: #Maths
[3:25:03] Arlaeya: they aren't even earning minimum wage half the time which is whole other issue since min wage hasn't changed in forever.
[3:25:04] Thowarr: @drax1957 He's just not gonna agree; it's a British thing
[3:25:08] rushof90: not all tipping is sub min wages either
[3:25:08] caradosailanthus: Dictionary from America or England?
[3:25:10] neverbornlucky: Taliesin plzz google donut chicken sandwhich  KFC
[3:25:12] Nulgar: Corgo100  Do kids these days not watch Reservoir Dogs? All but one of the literal gangsters agreed that tipping is sadly necessary, only the biggest dickhead in the group was against it
[3:25:13] hitchmeister59: Tipping started out as an optional bonus, but that was long before any of us were born.
[3:25:15] khalcrux_gaming: Fact: Words are made up and people who make the dictionaries make it up as they go along.
[3:25:16] atamala: the dictionary gets updated all of the time, it's helpful to understand lexicon but it doesn't dictate it
[3:25:17] JakeSezz: hahahaha exactly why I tip 20% minimum 😂
[3:25:23] rushof90: like pizza guy
[3:25:24] Mazerbeam: 20% is the minimum now in the states.
[3:25:25] Kortinas: Any news its 10!
[3:25:28] Yodamoo: Agreed
[3:25:31] Nusu1828: There are restaurants in the Seattle area where you don't tip now, because _they actually pay their staff_ The restaurant charges more
[3:25:42] Thoreya: no news :(
[3:25:42] Sharktribe: Tipping started as a way to cause poor servants to scramble for the crumbs of the rich as entertainment
[3:25:43] Thowarr: @caradosailanthus Oxford English Dictionary, which is British. We're using his own language on this
[3:25:43] sandpigeon: What I mean is generally the Dictionary is just an attempt to define how words are used, it's not prescribing how to use them or implying words are static
[3:25:44] zinfar: Tali, where is your 1 key bind? do you just start at 2?
[3:25:44] MeggoArt: it's the top of the hour..
[3:25:53] frankenfoot5: Yeah the USA has a lot of social issues. Tipping being one of them
[3:25:59] brennibrennt: Japan on top of the game as often
[3:25:59] Khadir84: they dont get paid enough  lol
[3:26:06] gsrasslan: When I worked at McDonald's in Denmark, it was illegal for me to accept a tip
[3:26:06] chelfx: Any news?
[3:26:08] KyleS07: So I had to run to lunch and maybe missed why we're talking about burger v sandwich?
[3:26:10] khalcrux_gaming: They get offended on behalf of the employer?
[3:26:10] Khadir84: they just taught to believe they do
[3:26:10] boubotte: i like the idea of paying extra when the service is really good, no matter what service it is 🤷‍♀️
[3:26:19] karklop: tipping culture is rooted in racism
[3:26:22] X_barley: JEREMY FEASEL DONT LET ME DOWN
[3:26:23] Thoreya: japan wages are not great chat..lol
[3:26:26] Its_Big_Tone: i think the servers in high end restaurants make great livings on tipping, but its the lower end of the spectrum that is rough.
[3:26:26] frankenfoot5: Oh no, we've infected you.
[3:26:33] neverbornlucky: Someone in chat plz tell Taliesin we really want to see the KFC donut chicken sandwhich
[3:26:35] thunduz: I agree with you
[3:26:51] RosieSeren: in the UK i tip when I have good service/nice experience
[3:26:53] Durwen: Also, it implies that you need an extra incentive to do your actual job
[3:27:03] JakeSezz: Good ol’ American Exceptionalism tneTaliCry
[3:27:09] KatieRet_: it must be different in the south, cause up north it's not really the done thing from what I've seen
[3:27:16] bubbleonia_rising: yep, workers > all
[3:27:22] Saiyori: wait so you tip in the UK? I've always heard that workers are paid a wage so it wasnt a thing there
[3:27:23] Thoreya: NO NEWS RIP
[3:27:23] slashpuppys: Americans also have a very weird obsession with employees smiling/being overly friendly. it was a culture shock
[3:27:25] Its_Big_Tone: also i think NOT tipping is way more rare that europians think, the service has to be terrible to get to that point
[3:27:26] SphericFormula: I think no WoW news :(
[3:27:27] X_barley: WoW twitter just retweeted AWCS right on the hour doesnt look like news rn
[3:27:31] loki_a: and that's the part i protest against by not tipping anywhere
[3:27:35] aeson_of_raid_sock: let’s tear it all down
[3:27:37] bashingsticks: no news :’(
[3:27:46] khalcrux_gaming: A pyramid scheme where the employers don't have any risk.
[3:27:53] CeasiusPls: bly]
[3:27:53] X_barley: 7 🙏
[3:27:53] Thowarr: @KatieRet_ See? His generalizations are just fine but people who actually live here won't be believed
[3:27:54] neverbornlucky: Taliesin don't you want to see how yummy the Donut chicken sandwhich from Kfc IS ?
[3:27:57] Thoreya: @slashpuppys would you like them to be rude?
[3:28:02] d__hizzle: @taliesinandevitel how do you feel about service charges in the UK
[3:28:05] Yodamoo: My biggest problem with tipping is that everywhere you go has a tip button now, even if there is no service
[3:28:10] KatieRet_: sorry, by north i meant north england, in that tipping isnt common
[3:28:14] 3Duxie: maybe the real pirates were the firends we made along the way....
[3:28:15] Nusu1828: 100% Pay your employees
[3:28:24] X_barley: What was up with the chicken and drumstick emojis?
[3:28:26] Durwen: have you chosen an outfit yet?
[3:28:39] RosieSeren: auto service for big tables is a great idea
[3:28:55] grimzero617: Inflation is so wild that it's hard to imagine going out to eat
[3:28:58] d__hizzle: @taliesinandevitel is it wrong to remove the service charge?
[3:28:59] Aakku: Americans also get personally offended by folks making a living wage...
[3:29:01] Deatheran: @taliesinandevitel trick question in canada and us we have service charges but still mostly does not go to servers
[3:29:05] Its_Big_Tone: @RosieSeren legally anything over a party of 5 has 20% gratuity
[3:29:15] manmower: how do you think we keep our chicken sandwich prices low?
[3:29:18] Thowarr: @Its_Big_Tone and a tip is still expected
[3:29:35] khalcrux_gaming: I remember someone saying burgers would go up 10 cents if wages went up thinking that would make it unfavorable.
[3:29:36] stonespetty: Those chicken sandwiches on your screen are making me HUNGRY!!
[3:29:36] neverbornlucky: OK i GIVE UP tALIESIN NEVER GOING TO LOOK AT THE  KFC donut chicken sandwhich
[3:29:39] Its_Big_Tone: @Thowarr no no its not, we sit down seeing the gratuity tip right away
[3:29:46] funviking99: yep
[3:29:52] mattyxoqt: included in the price is better
[3:29:58] TheDeekins: what's this "our" chicken prices fam?  do you own the chicken factory??
[3:30:05] funviking99: tipping is dumb
[3:30:10] NeeK_23: why are americans so against seeing others have livable wages. have you no compassion?
[3:30:13] RosieSeren: some do prefer cash tips though, some businessess can be shady
[3:30:16] X_barley: Yeahhhhhhh
[3:30:19] khalcrux_gaming: Biden is trying to get rid of hidden fees
[3:30:23] VerityNS: yeah i hate that
[3:30:25] thunduz: you don't like our "sales tax"
[3:30:27] Nusu1828: right? it's wild to calculate prices of shopping because they do the tax at the end
[3:30:31] Thowarr: 17% lol?
[3:30:32] ravenstarr: that would be nice.
[3:30:33] atamala: yeah ill agree that is fucked
[3:30:34] TownieTV: Canada doesn't include anything in the listed price either
[3:30:36] Angel_Ink: thats not allowed here
[3:30:36] frankenfoot5: Hey Tali, real sidenote and unrelated to this conversation, but i'm not doing so hot lately. Your content does still put a smile on my face, so thank you.
[3:30:40] Nusu1828: and our sales tax (at least in our state) varies by county and city
[3:30:45] DozlaT: our schooling is bad so thats one way to make us keep up with math
[3:30:52] Quackster27: just advertise the correct price
[3:30:53] manmower: with that logic how would you trick dumb people?
[3:30:54] ravenstarr: Publish it on the shelf.
[3:30:55] thunduz: tneEvi
[3:30:58] funviking99: LUL
[3:31:07] Saiyori: It's not included in the price so that it looks cheaper and then you buy it then pay the tax
[3:31:11] mrsrockguru: evenin @TaliesinAndEvitel and chat
[3:31:16] X_barley: Only communists want to see the true prices of goods they purchase
[3:31:18] Sarkans41: it used to be because sales tax was often different between even cities and counties so they just added on at the register instead of having to make tags and things for each specific location
[3:31:20] bubbleonia_rising: yep, our system blows. You should see our income tax system (you figure it out and if the IRS decides you're wrong, you get penalized).
[3:31:25] khalcrux_gaming: Wow that is like a middle finger
[3:31:28] Pavo444: that’s so true
[3:31:28] Dunkurk: It's really weird when you visit a US state taht dosnt have sales tax and you walk to the till expecting to have to pay more and it comes up at the sticker price
[3:31:29] Sarkans41: now a days with technology there is no excuse
[3:31:30] pernvandamme: it's the same reason everything ends in .99, it's a business psych scam
[3:31:35] random_redshirt: Yeah, listing tax price would be great, especially since not everything is subject to sales tax.  Just put the actual price on the sign.
[3:31:53] rushof90: even better crossing state and even county lines changes sales tax
[3:31:55] rws26: @bubbleonia_rising Don't forget in order to give $$ to worthless tax preparation midle-men!
[3:31:55] TownieTV: except costco in the UK doesn't list VAT on its prices and that's really frustrating.
[3:31:57] KyleS07: Sales tax is different between city, county, and state. It could still be on the tag
[3:31:58] viirracocha: here it wouldnt work, they be forced to charge u the price what is shown on the product
[3:32:00] ravenstarr: that would be great.
[3:32:06] rws26: You missed out the part I'm the most appreciative of.
[3:32:09] Sarkans41: @bubbleonia_rising This is because not all income is reported to the IRS.  By LAW it is on you to report all of your income
[3:32:17] Yodamoo: Canada does :(
[3:32:30] Angel_Ink: true
[3:32:32] Nusu1828: eink price tags that are networked on all the shelves, would make it easy to show the price after tax in the US
[3:32:38] Yodamoo: I hate how many things we do here that are the same as the states lol
[3:32:46] Saiyori: oh, no, in the states they change that shit all the time
[3:32:48] bubbleonia_rising: @rws26 which is exactly why the system works that way. So that someone else can take advantage of it and charge you a premium to "guarantee" the result.
[3:32:59] viirracocha: think its same all over Eu
[3:33:00] RosieSeren: a lot of places do honour price mistakes too
[3:33:22] stonespetty: I design packaging for a living - it would be impossible to print custom packaging for each place - when tax rates in the U.S. are different everywhere - and they often change
[3:33:28] VerityNS: In Sweden if they marked a good wrong they cant refuse to sell it if i take it to the register and wants to buy it
[3:33:31] SphericFormula: How long we giving it for news?
[3:33:49] Nosdunk24: i mean america just sucks overall
[3:33:51] Dak0vic: You working with "retail" now! hheuheuheuhe
[3:33:52] manlywilliammarsh: Canada has a scanning code of practice things marked wrong like that they would essentially get it free
[3:33:54] funviking99: sad day, no news BibleThump
[3:33:55] stonespetty: Oh! believe me, I've told them!!
[3:33:56] ravenstarr: agreed
[3:34:07] Saiyori: price tags are labor to put out and i guess that costs too much money to buy them and do that
[3:34:09] Dunkurk: we have packaging in the UK with price tags on it tho like pesi bottles ect
[3:34:15] caradosailanthus: Much of the stuff I buy doesn't even have price tags on it
[3:34:19] random_redshirt: American stores do use price tags, don't know what that's about.  Maybe not in bookstores?
[3:34:19] Thowarr: Yeah, just like the British Virgin Islands... which doesn't use VAT! USE THE PRICE TAGS
[3:34:22] steelman55: Delaware has no sales tax
[3:34:23] Yodamoo: Here if an item in a grocery store is mislabeled and costs less than $10 they have to give it for free. kinda off topic but fun fact lol
[3:34:26] X_barley: Shadowlands us would think we're spoiled for wanting news so soon after a patch
[3:34:31] caradosailanthus: Yeah, like what Tali just said, it's just on the shelf
[3:34:33] KamkazeV2: I feel like non-Americans dont understand how different each state is. A lot of these seeming stupidities are because every state has its own tax rate, laws, etc.
[3:34:37] Krogothian: It's not fine. It's just wrong.
[3:34:39] grimzero617: Nobody likes it, for sure
[3:34:39] Sarkans41: Walgreens will modify the price of the items depending on the demographics on the zip code the store it in.  My city has 5 stores in 3 price brackets.  They can add the tax to the tag
[3:34:41] Nusu1828: the only product sold in the US with the tax included is gasoline
[3:34:42] d__hizzle: the VAT method is really nice, but the percentage is higher than I’d pay in the USA
[3:34:43] dookie_44: Seriously hate living here, all the taxes, fees, and TIPPING...
[3:34:44] Vahs_Redclaw: yeah the main reason is cause different states have different tax rules
[3:34:47] Ciek: you can put a "suggested price" on the packaging, plenty of companies do that
[3:34:57] Saiyori: It kinda does bc every state is it's own scam rofl
[3:34:59] Thoreya: how is the world generally doing right now? LUL LUL
[3:34:59] Thowarr: IT HAS EVERYTHING TO DO WITH IT
[3:35:01] Sharktribe: The states aren't *that* different lol
[3:35:03] Sarkans41: @Vahs_Redclaw no excuse now, maybe 50 years ago
[3:35:13] Thowarr: There's a separation between FEDERAL AND STATE
[3:35:15] Vahs_Redclaw: @Vahs_Redclaw that doesnt make sense cause it is still that way
[3:35:17] Nulgar: @KamkazeV2 I feel like Americans don't understand what a Federation is
[3:35:18] Nosdunk24: Why are you saying "you guys" as if we have any control over this?
[3:35:21] Andanole: Don't expect price tags from a country tha uses Month/Day/Year as a date instead of Day/Month/Year!!
[3:35:23] Sarkans41: @Thowarr there is no federal sales tax tho
[3:35:24] Nusu1828: gas/petrol stations have demonstrated how to sell a product that _includes_ the tax
[3:35:24] stonespetty: yes - we have MANY stupid rules
[3:35:30] Mazerbeam: You'd be surprised how much state power there is in America
[3:35:30] Zerluck: its only to trick people that its cheaper than it is
[3:35:31] atamala: why do you guys drive on the left side of the road? nearly the rest of the world is on the right. it's so stupid
[3:35:31] KamkazeV2: It's absolutely true. Related to tipping, some states can underpay employees and assume tips make the difference, while other states require minimum payment regardless of tip.
[3:35:45] Sharktribe: Guys this really isn't complicated, The States does this wrong
[3:35:49] skeletonetiquette: Out of curiosity are your goods typically still in .99 increments? I would assume so
[3:36:03] Quackster27: usa too big to be functional
[3:36:05] d__hizzle: Tali you’re right 😂 there’s no reason not to have it built in
[3:36:07] khalcrux_gaming: Poor Tali is trying to preach sanity.
[3:36:08] Mazerbeam: Well that's theft, because you left the Philly shop without paying
[3:36:08] Krogothian: If you buy it in Montana or Oregon the listed price is the price
[3:36:12] oaxole: @skeletonetiquette Yes, but thats more about marketing than tax reasons
[3:36:14] Thowarr: @Sarkans41 Exactly; you'd need a FEDERAL tax to replace all of this. You have different state laws that would need to be superceded by FEDERAL legislation
[3:36:14] mattyxoqt: wait so the price on the shelf is not correct in the states?
[3:36:18] gsrasslan: Then that's still stealing it from the first shop
[3:36:22] phritss: You ok Taliesin?
[3:36:25] viirracocha: here the prices are the same no matter if u change state, as long as u buy from the same chain of shop
[3:36:28] phritss: lol
[3:36:31] Krogothian: @mattyxoqt Unless it's Montana or Oregon, yes
[3:36:34] Tahtiania: I think it would be easier to put the price with the sales tax included
[3:36:36] Sarkans41: @Thowarr no you dont.  Stores already change prices based on location they can easily add the tax to the item
[3:36:38] DozlaT: lol no you dont, they can do it by state guys
[3:36:41] d__hizzle: @mattyxoqt no, sales tax gets added on at the till
[3:36:44] manmower: that logic doesn't seem a good way to maximize the money you make
[3:36:46] rws26: Any state could require businesses to display the final price, they choose not to.
[3:36:47] aeson_of_raid_sock: we have state and local
[3:36:47] Thowarr: THEN THERE'S 50 DIFFERENT SALES TAXES, WHICH IS 50 DIFFERENT VATS
[3:36:50] Nusu1828: computers already handle all this stuff at the POS, it's not hard to just do it on the price tag ont he shelf. it's super easy
[3:36:54] phritss: I think he has cracked @chat
[3:36:58] DozlaT: im agreeing im talking to the chatter
[3:36:58] Tahtiania: they are already writing out the prices for these items so they can include the tax
[3:37:00] Sharktribe: Why are people so stupid in this chat right now
[3:37:02] Nulgar: @Thowarr you have ONE place of sale, where the same tax applies for all items in that store's location
[3:37:03] CochaCR: or just add the tax below the price and I can do the math myself
[3:37:04] pernvandamme: There is no universal sale tag shop lol. It could easily be added to our tags but they won't because they want the scam
[3:37:10] CeasiusPls: I think you just broke the Americans LUL
[3:37:11] random_redshirt: Base prices are already different between and within states anyways, it literally is not an issue to put the entire price on a tag on the shelf or the product.
[3:37:13] Tahtiania: thank you
[3:37:14] stonespetty: There are too many variables. Each city has different tax rates
[3:37:17] Krogothian: Sales tax is applied more than just state wide, there's also local tax. Doesn't matter, you'd print the label there with the price applied.
[3:37:18] skeletonetiquette: @oaxole oh yeah for sure just curious cause after tax our amounts are always some stupid shit lol like .34 cents, so dumb... UK much better in that case
[3:37:19] MeggoArt: they simply don't want to pay the workers to put prices on things
[3:37:19] slashpuppys: How is that so hard to understand for americans?
[3:37:22] HolocronCoder: As an American, Tali is completely right, guys. Stop being dumb
[3:37:23] crazidaizi: This is amazing
[3:37:24] hitchmeister59: No shop in the US has cashiers in two different states.
[3:37:24] ravenstarr: often prices are listed in .99 increments to play off the same visual scam for people to think that the price is lower than it is.
[3:37:29] grimzero617: It's only an issue for online stuff. Individual stores could put the full cost
[3:37:36] Sharktribe: Why are Americans so stupid.  Please stop arguing for the bad American system, chat
[3:37:38] Sarkans41: @Nulgar sometimes the price you pay can change just by going across town.  Chains will do this.
[3:37:38] caradosailanthus: They can do online sales tax application too, based on geotagging.
[3:37:38] khalcrux_gaming: When they pull you over they can't ask you if you know why they pulled you over cause you might confess to a crime. Is that crazy Tali?
[3:37:39] VerityNS: Jesus how dumb can you be for real? wtf is this ?
[3:37:40] Maellin: A single feder sales tax hits folks middle class or lower harder than rich. That's why policitians love it. Take 20 percent off 1000 and see if you are happy...but take 20 percent of 1 million and the rich are still happy.
[3:37:41] aeson_of_raid_sock: I don’t know what mine is
[3:37:42] Trebled_Mind: capitalism has literally brainwashed America.
[3:37:42] d__hizzle: @taliesinandevitel what about online sales
[3:37:44] Saiyori: That happens when you're gaslit from birth
[3:37:44] Thoreya: ah yes, were wrong LUL
[3:37:44] LadyDors: I love this
[3:37:48] ScalpelHeals: You're trying to explain denominations to a country that relates all measurements to objects in one way or another
[3:37:48] SquiggySquonk: tneEvi tneEvi tneEvi
[3:37:51] oaxole: the same items in the same store brand can have different prices in different cities, before tax. Its not an issue to just put the whole price on the tag
[3:37:54] dookie_44: They're dumbasses, we have lots of em here
[3:37:54] mydemoncat: nut meat sandwhich
[3:37:55] viirracocha: its just a tool for Americans too scam their own customers
[3:37:55] TownieTV: You basically summed up what it is to be American
[3:37:56] ravenstarr: I agree with you on this.
[3:37:56] SquiggySquonk: Jesus Christ.
[3:37:56] holyzeke: omg walk did I walk in 🤣
[3:37:58] funviking99: Kappa
[3:38:00] NEXTGENeric: what do you mean "you people"
[3:38:00] random_redshirt: American who's worked in a store here, Tali is absolutely right, stop arguing.
[3:38:00] MrAxeffect: most things i buy has a paper sticker OVER the msrp price on the item
[3:38:00] Nulgar: @Sarkans41 THE SAME LOCATION. Not the same town, not the same street, the same literal ADDRESS
[3:38:02] thunduz: yeah that's weird
[3:38:04] JakeSezz: Least amount of work for maximum amount of profit. It’s the American Way jakese1Burn
[3:38:06] Teosik: online retailers
[3:38:06] Sarkans41: @Maellin this makes no sense... a sales tax is a sales tax regardless of where it originates
[3:38:07] Nusu1828: this is a solved problem literally everywhere outside the US, but we have to do things weird here.
[3:38:08] kiewies: You understand how frustrating it is to be an American with half a brain.
[3:38:10] skeletonetiquette: Having the taxes baked in is the way to go for sure, so much easier
[3:38:15] sim967: lol can I interject one small exception?
[3:38:18] DozlaT: lol right, they have no real reason not to print the actual price
[3:38:19] thunduz: a product should cost the same all across the board
[3:38:20] Vahs_Redclaw: i was wrong earlier worrying about state to state rules, its purly just a "laissez-faire capitalism" stores chose not to put sales tax on it to help sell better
[3:38:25] RosieSeren: england and wales have different tax for alchohol, we have no problem
[3:38:26] stonespetty: America is insane - you're correct
[3:38:27] Sharktribe: @Teosik stoooooooppppp
[3:38:31] iRegretn0thing: And these people vote.
[3:38:37] Mazerbeam: You can't put the actual price on the price tag because BIG TAX lobbied against it and has the lawmakers backing them /s
[3:38:44] Quackster27: this is a rough one lmao
[3:38:45] bubbleonia_rising: our education system teaches our children how to be good little robot consumer/patriots. It doesn't do a good job teaching critical thought or basic life skills.
[3:38:49] atamala: honestly it probably started because there was no sales tax, and when they added one, retailers didnt want to update all of the prices intheir store
[3:38:51] Thowarr: And we have sales taxes of differing amounts with Amazon
[3:38:52] d__hizzle: @taliesinandevitel for example, wow subs are like $14.99 or whatever in the USA, but when paying the different state taxes it is a completely different number
[3:38:54] Thowarr: They show them
[3:38:54] viirracocha: no wonder they voted for Biden hahah
[3:38:59] stonespetty: Even Amazon's pricing is different by region.
[3:39:01] Nusu1828: Avalara does, they make the software that pretty much everyone uses
[3:39:03] Maellin: @Sarkans41 You are being deliberately obtuse. A  poor person can't afford to lose 200 dollars on a 1000 dollar purchase. A multi millionaire views 20 percent as change
[3:39:05] Sarkans41: its based on your shipping location.
[3:39:06] Vaephera: I think mostly the websites are "run" in a state without sales taxes and they just don't pay
[3:39:07] d__hizzle: @taliesinandevitel but I agree with you VAT is easier
[3:39:11] iRegretn0thing: I think i'll need a chicken sandwich from Popeyes.
[3:39:13] Nosdunk24: @TaliesinAndEvitel different question: why do you guys drive on the wrong side of the road? It makes no sense. Majority of countries drive on the right side not the left
[3:39:16] TankieLite: crikSuffer
[3:39:17] vlaovich88: It would also be easy to program online retailers to add it to the price as long as the user doesn't have a VPN on.
[3:39:17] nyrhalahotep: most propagandized country on the planet, completely in the dark about how citizens should be treated
[3:39:18] hitchmeister59: There was a time when you could buy something online from a different state and not pay any sales tax. Now they charge you based on where you have it delivered.,
[3:39:19] khalcrux_gaming: Oh. You remind me of Frank Grimes. lol
[3:39:22] ScalpelHeals: also state taxes? forget about that when they go down to the county level... google US county tax map
[3:39:23] Zerluck: Sleepy Joe is more in the game than these people argueing xD
[3:39:24] slashpuppys: It just seems like a scam to scam people out of more money since they cannot add everything up while shopping
[3:39:25] TheSonicDwarf: there has never been a time where tax was added to an item as the sale price
[3:39:25] caradosailanthus: It's bullshit for online shops too
[3:39:25] Tahtiania: I hate that tax isn't on the price cause its an annoying surprise of oh no add on the 7.5% tax
[3:39:29] stonespetty: exactly
[3:39:31] VerityNS: Also there is onlineshopping in ALL countries in the world anyways and there are more countriies then there is US states
[3:39:41] skeletonetiquette: It's cause America loves to blame the government, like well I'm only charging you _____ whatever you walk out paying isn't my fault
[3:39:42] Mazerbeam: Whoever told you that is a moron
[3:39:46] Krogothian: For online the tax is applied based on where the person buying is located. So if you live in Oregon it's nothing but if you live in Texas it adds the state tax then the local tax.
[3:39:47] Sarkans41: @Maellin a 20% sales tax is on its face absurd.  But a sales tax is NOT regressive as you imply.  The tax applies equally to everyone regardless of the amount they spend.
[3:39:49] rws26: Could never do that basic arithmetic of taxes with computers tali, it's like magnets,  no one knows how they work.
[3:39:49] nyrhalahotep: the cruelty of greed is the point
[3:39:51] Nusu1828: it is laziness that prevents US stores from putting the price with tax baked in, pretty much the only reason why it's not done
[3:39:52] Vaephera: Holly if you're out there please tweet a pirate flag to distract tali
[3:39:54] Vahs_Redclaw: @stonespetty thats not true they choose not to took a quick search and looking at about 3 links in 2 minutes to find that out
[3:39:54] Nusu1828: outside of gas stations
[3:39:56] LadyDors: EleGiggle
[3:40:02] DozlaT: please holly post some pirate thing
[3:40:05] siegeorc: where I live in the U.S. we don’t have a sales tax, but when I travel I forget it and it pisses me off so much!
[3:40:07] xacktal: Also Amazon and every other online retailers includes the tax in the price here in Europe, depending on the country it'll be delivered to
[3:40:11] thunduz: This is annoying why buisness's say "oh we price compare" like that shouldn't be a thing
[3:40:14] KamkazeV2: I dont blame the government. I blame corporations who lobby for what youre describing
[3:40:17] gsrasslan: online stores are international. The respective countries tax is still included
[3:40:22] gsrasslan: so why not state tax
[3:40:24] iRegretn0thing: We're the same country thats heading to the same clown show election we had 4 years ago. Our country is fucked.
[3:40:28] bottis96: ok we get it chicken burger
[3:40:31] funviking99: why they d that lmao
[3:40:31] sim967: not all entities have to pay sales tax
[3:40:32] bubbleonia_rising: @nyrhalahotep truth. Worse, even our search engines lecture us if we try to learn more about something beyond the current marketing / propaganda.
[3:40:37] Sharktribe: Corporations want people to misdirect their anger at their representation instead of the copors
[3:40:50] d__hizzle: @taliesinandevitel poor kid should’ve made more money ☠️
[3:40:51] Nulgar: Look, I get handling different sales taxes when you're doing proper sales contracts for big stuff like kitchens, I worked on a software that handled selling kitchens and furniture, including to people in neighboring countries, who are charged different amounts of sales tax. But that doesn't apply to retail stores! One store, one location, one sales tax per item - it may vary from item to item (e.g. bread) but for the same item, the price is ALWAYS THE SAME.
[3:40:52] Tahtiania: @iRegretn0thing that's true
[3:40:56] Tahalamaius: my own opinion is so they can price gouge between different areas and thats why they dont put pricing on it
[3:40:58] Nosdunk24: I mean america is a fucking clown show, we are so fucked
[3:41:33] Maellin: @Sarkans41 No it does not. Stop with the plebian love of the rich. Your never gonna be a billionaire. Don't carry the water for them free ofr charge. Sales tax is always regressive for the poor and middle class. Period.
[3:41:35] nyrhalahotep: A monetary-based economic system is for primates
[3:41:53] aeson_of_raid_sock: you’re asking is to do math. no thanks
[3:41:53] random_redshirt: @xacktal That's how it works in the US as well.  If an online retailer doesn't include the sales tax in the purchase, it's on the purchaser to calculate it separately and pay it as part of filing their taxes.
[3:42:00] Trebled_Mind: the perfect background for this conversation is the Google image search of a burger 😂😂😂😂😂
[3:42:00] Zerluck: @Nosdunk24 Its looks like many places and US is one of them that the whole system starts to breakdown
[3:42:02] RosieSeren: also in the uk lots of items don't have tax, like kid's clothes
[3:42:02] dookie_44: This basically scamming here, they want to display the lower, pre-tax number
[3:42:04] rws26: It's not the "government" but it is the elected officials in the U.S. who do not work for the public's general interests at all, they could do this in a heartbeat.  Businesses are not going to do that voluntarily.
[3:42:06] emylinn: I agree, same here in Sweden
[3:42:08] Mazerbeam: This just in! America is ass-backwards.
[3:42:08] Vahs_Redclaw: the job of the price tag specifically in the US is to make the product convincing to buy, as strange as that is to say
[3:42:24] Nulgar: FULL DISCLOSURE: the full price was always the same, it just put varying amounts of sales tax on the order, so that the customer could claim it back from the gov
[3:42:29] slashpuppys: so it is a scam
[3:42:33] TownieTV: the American system is set up to make it's people fail. Poor education and making them do math everywhere.
[3:42:34] caradosailanthus: I worked for the USDA and buying things without sales tax was so difficult.  Because I had to be just hi yeah, the US government is buying this, don't apply tax and just show this piece of paper that is literally just something I could have printed up on my home computer.
[3:42:36] Nosdunk24: @TaliesinAndEvitel different question: why do you guys drive on the wrong side of the road? It makes no sense. Majority of countries drive on the right side not the left
[3:42:40] aeson_of_raid_sock: it’s like tipping. owners pushing the math work onto us
[3:42:43] Nusu1828: there are a lot of washington state residents who should be paying use/sales tax on purchase made in oregon (particularly those who  live in vancouver wa), but don't
[3:42:43] Vahs_Redclaw: shops CAN put tax on it, but they dont and thats our capitalism
[3:42:44] witchhobbit: we could have had bernie sanders NotLikeThis
[3:42:47] DiceTry: Didn't realize I popped into a popeyes stream
[3:43:04] DozlaT: please pirate gods hear our prayer 🙏
[3:43:06] funviking99: this drought of news is worse than shadowlands drought of anima Kappa
[3:43:08] Yodamoo: To be fair, it is easier to do the math adding 5% to a number than to remove the amount that would be the 5% of the non taxed number... But I would assume the store would have a database of untaxed prices LUL
[3:43:09] kiewies: If there is one thing that your streams always do for me, it's to help elucidate the fact that America has a largely defunct education system.
[3:43:11] Nulgar: oh, not disagreeing with you, Tali, just pointing out a silliness tneEvi
[3:43:21] VerityNS: I mean in Sweden the VAT is MAndatory to show on the reciet you get when you pay
[3:43:39] slashpuppys: @Yodamoo ...like they all have? to do iventory?
[3:43:44] skeletonetiquette: XD
[3:43:56] random_redshirt: You made plenty of sense, Tali, people are just being weird
[3:43:56] gsrasslan: I really thought even americans hated the price tag thing
[3:43:59] oaxole: people love to die for the government
[3:43:59] shivena_: In Germany they put the proper price on it and you can just see how much vat you paid on the receipt which you get anyways. so... yeah xD
[3:44:03] atamala: I disagreed with the statement that generally americans are rude to wait staff but I agree that sales tax not on the price is stupid
[3:44:09] grimzero617: I will die on this hill. That's a chicken sandwich.
[3:44:10] Maellin: @kiewies Unbelievable so. I'm a geologist and I fill in teaching college students some times. The need for most students to have remedial classes to fill in the gaps is crazy.
[3:44:10] witchhobbit: yeah it's really unfortunate
[3:44:13] sim967: internet happens
[3:44:14] Yodamoo: @slashpuppys Exactly...Just trying to figure out excuses they would use to justify it...but I don't agree with it lol
[3:44:15] Vahs_Redclaw: people like to die on hills these days
[3:44:23] slashpuppys: @Yodamoo aahh my bad! :3
[3:44:27] Quackster27: unfortunately...
[3:44:29] DozlaT: yea some people cant see outside what they're used to
[3:44:30] witchhobbit: which is why this 2024 election is driving me up a wall
[3:44:33] hitchmeister59: Movie theaters in the US are the one place that understands this. You $15 ticket is not $15. It's $12-$13 plus the sales tax so you pay $15.
[3:44:41] manmower: american waitstaff are ruder
[3:44:46] KamkazeV2: I don't defend the system, but I think Europeans vastly overgeneralize and group Americans into a single cultural group.
[3:44:48] Yodamoo: @slashpuppys It's ok...we can still be friends :p
[3:44:56] nyrhalahotep: in their defense, the boot licking propaganda is insidious and deep-seeded
[3:44:58] FatCatDad48: I'm general Americans can't accept the fact the there are better ways to do things than the way we do it
[3:45:01] thunduz: are you suggesting we are impatient?
[3:45:05] Tahalamaius: in america wait staff arent people
[3:45:06] FatCatDad48: *in
[3:45:12] Saiyori: americans treat them as npcs
[3:45:13] Rhys_Velaris: They treat waitstaff as if they are doing a job not worth recognizing them for
[3:45:18] warrenny: very blunt
[3:45:20] slashpuppys: @manmower because they have to deal with 100 rude people a day, youre just ordering once a day. ofc we mirror
[3:45:21] Maellin: When I give my order. I say thank you. I never start with  please.
[3:45:23] atamala: it's funny because I hear the opposite from europeans, that americans are overly friendly, and smile, etc it's just weird to hear your experience
[3:45:30] caradosailanthus: I don't think I say please so much, but lots and lots of thank you's
[3:45:33] Sarkans41: @Maellin how would you implement a non-regressive sales tax?  im very curious of your plan here given you seem like such a tax expert.
[3:45:36] KamkazeV2: You describe British people like they aren't overgeneralized as incredibly rude by other Europeans...
[3:45:36] manmower: we should invest in robot waitstaff, wont have to tip
[3:45:38] gulrakrurs: As someone who worked in a Pizza Hut for 6 years. Americans are assholes to service staff, as are employers for fucking them over on money
[3:45:47] Yodamoo: They have to be....
[3:46:01] CeasiusPls: can I get a bo'ol o wo'ah
[3:46:12] databob1: I worked in customer service for 22 years even if something is wrong I and vary nice to retail workers
[3:46:13] skeletonetiquette: If the shoe fits wear it, if not it's not a big deal
[3:46:20] slashpuppys: yeah exactly what i say. having to be so fake friendly all the time makes customers way more rude and out of line since they cannot talk back
[3:46:27] Krogothian: I'd rather people be genuine with me instead of pretend because they want money.
[3:46:35] skeletonetiquette: People getting upset over the notion that rude people exist in America xD
[3:46:42] grimzero617: I don't want a lunch friend that I pay for food. I want a waiter. But no need to be a dick about it
[3:46:54] JMcGhee559: @Krogothian we'd have to pay them a living wage
[3:47:01] nyrhalahotep: they have to imitate niceness and placate the customer out of fear of being homeless and destitute, it's a parasitic Disturbia
[3:47:05] atamala: maybe it's a regional us thing, being in the midwest you'd be hard to find a person being rude to waitstaff
[3:47:08] dookie_44: People are going to argue the niceness is due to tipping.  Service is better in many Asian countries like Japan, Taiwan, etc and there is no tipping there
[3:47:08] OatsMate: If they're rude and it's a caribbean restaurant that just means you're gonna have good food.
[3:47:09] Krogothian: @JMcGhee559 Yeah can't have that.
[3:47:13] khalcrux_gaming: Then there are the wrok till you die people are so upset when you're not jumping for joy at a bad job.
[3:47:16] KamkazeV2: Really sounds like you just like what you are familiar with and is "natural" to you, and Americans are different, which is bad
[3:47:25] KeyouiX: the customer service voice is a lot
[3:47:30] skeletonetiquette: Cause they are starving without it
[3:47:44] sterlz_the_ok: my mom raised me to not say anything if I had nothing nice to say.
[3:47:46] databob1: those chicken burgers are making me hungry
[3:47:46] Thowarr: @atamala Nah, it's his instance on all Americans being like this. Generalizations and all
[3:47:52] Sharktribe: Another dig in 8 mins
[3:47:53] Thoreya: idk maybe its just a dumb american, but i dont appreciate rude waiters lol
[3:47:57] Sarkans41: the guy who runs the carribean restaurant in my city is a super nice guy.  i used to live in the same complex as him
[3:48:06] funviking99: LUL
[3:48:16] slashpuppys: Rude isnt the same as overly friendly/fake
[3:48:17] aeson_of_raid_sock: beef patty worth it
[3:48:24] Sharktribe: AMericans are MUCH more informal, but also, much more indifferent/rude
[3:48:27] atamala: @Thowarr yeah but if his experience is only in phildelphia, then it makes sense to me that his experience might be that way
[3:48:30] grimzero617: There's actually a restaurant chain where the waiters are rude to you as part of the theme
[3:48:33] Nulgar: oh btw this also applies to any public-facing employee - to the point that people, stupid fucking people, claim that because Ion Hazzikostas uses "lawyer speech" because he's not ORGASMICALLY EXCITED about talking to the interviewer
[3:48:41] Thoreya: havent been to europe, been to south america a bit
[3:48:51] TheDeekins: @TaliesinAndEvitel Americans are bizarrely obsessed with explicitly servile waitstaff
[3:48:51] Saiyori: America definitely has a "beatings will continue until morale improves" attitude toward staff from their managers. if you arent fake nice enough then you can actually get fired.
[3:48:53] gerruler: Yeah, typically in US and US related countries, they kind of try to fake it to make it feel "the client is above all". That certainly deosn't happen in a lot of places in Europe. The rest of us in other parts ofAmerica (the continent), sadly follow suit with the US.
[3:49:01] Triskelian: I think you mean more business-like, Tali
[3:49:08] markaud23: You're right on target Tali, american's treatment of service workers is notoriously awful
[3:49:09] aeson_of_raid_sock: we had some amazing wait staff in the uk and Ireland
[3:49:15] KamkazeV2: You would like the subreddit r/AmericaBad
[3:49:19] atamala: I guess as an american, someone from Wisconsin is not the same as someone from New York which is why I struggle with "americans are..." statements
[3:49:31] grimzero617: Yeah it's really fun. We asked for separate bills and they said "then next time sit at separate tables"
[3:49:33] Maellin: @Sarkans41 There is no solution at this time. The rich and corporations and won't allow it. I think sales tax should be scrapped or layered in a progressive way. After taxes are filed each year you get a scan card that you slide when you purchase and it sets your tax rate. Have none for folks below 400k income a year and tax the rich at 96 percent. Punishing the rich is the only way it can be done. Making them fear. Otherwise we are just stuck.
[3:49:34] kissesaurus: what about french?
[3:49:35] aeson_of_raid_sock: my wife gave her bouquet to our awesome server
[3:49:38] kiewies: Americans don't understand a genuine interaction because most Americans engage primarily with niceties in order to make sure they smooth over any problems that that person might have with you because anyone in America can shoot you or pop off on you because half of Americans needs SSRIs to maintain a normal face.
[3:49:38] kaijoe_: Am Italian. Facts.
[3:49:40] Thoreya: @KamkazeV2 everyone who isnt from the US would prob like it lol
[3:49:43] Krogothian: For American's it's the difference between DMV employee and waitress. They're not rude, their job just doesn't depend on them being a sycophant.
[3:49:47] RosieSeren: there's a family run italian restaurant in my town, they are hilarious, and great food, but lots of shouting lol
[3:49:56] d__hizzle: @taliesinandevitel Eating out in America is also a lot about the experience, I think. So maybe that might be a reason performance is so baked in idk
[3:50:00] GoldSmog: it's not just transactional in the US. Wierd ppl like to feel like they're loading over someone
[3:50:12] skeletonetiquette: How was the staff in Japan? They always seemed so welcoming, gotta go some day
[3:50:12] GoldSmog: lording
[3:50:14] jawea: this is a lot of time on sandwiches isn’t it
[3:50:26] gryffiest: no news today? :Z
[3:50:33] thunduz: valid take
[3:50:48] Vahs_Redclaw: LUL
[3:50:54] Vahs_Redclaw: we got movies about it and they still dont get it
[3:50:54] aeson_of_raid_sock: I like the spit
[3:50:56] Krogothian: If they're rude to the staff they like the spit
[3:50:57] mantooth11: Most people in America are actually very polite to customer service employees. It's just that none of the polite ones show up on TikTok.
[3:50:58] sandpigeon: @gryffiest i would bet news hits at the beginning of the week, not on a friday
[3:50:59] thunduz: it adds flavor
[3:51:04] boubotte: Parisians are more rude than french people in general, tbh it's mostly coz we have social rules (like... saying bonjour) and if you don't do em, yeah, we gonna be rude
[3:51:04] Quackster27: it shows when a customer has never worked in service or retail
[3:51:10] lunakinthedruid: I do actually lol
[3:51:12] Maellin: I came in after the popeyes part..why is there a popeyes sandwhich on the screan. I love popeyes. I come from the area is originated.
[3:51:17] Ciek: the yelp reviewer episode of south park shows this phenomenon lol
[3:51:21] lunakinthedruid: true
[3:51:31] I2ey25: I worked at restaurants from age 15 to 26 and I never once saw someone actually spit in the food
[3:51:41] grimzero617: It is a chicken sandwich
[3:51:41] shivena_: @Maellin because its a burger :D
[3:51:44] grimzero617: Freedom
[3:51:44] steelman55: Chicken burger?
[3:51:47] khalcrux_gaming: I called it a burger
[3:51:50] Krogothian: It's a chicken sandwich
[3:51:50] Vandosz: borgir
[3:51:50] jawea: it’s a sandwich
[3:51:51] mantooth11: WTF is a chicken burger?
[3:51:57] slashpuppys: @I2ey25 you do it in secret so you dont get reported ;)
[3:52:01] cyclopsnerd: what if we call a burger a sandwich
[3:52:03] REKGameZ: im a north american and its a chicken burger
[3:52:03] gsrasslan: Poll?
[3:52:10] d__hizzle: @taliesinandevitel I once had a table of 15 take up my whole section once, and the moment the food touched the table one lady started complaining and suddenly everyone’s food was either cold or wrong lol. Their pastor was the only one to tip ($5)
[3:52:11] Quackster27: uuuugh lmao
[3:52:13] boubotte: yup, only americans
[3:52:20] Casual_Trifle: oh god we're cycleing back lol
[3:52:20] databob1: I just wanna call it lunch
[3:52:20] gsrasslan: but still fun :D
[3:52:21] MeggoArt: what about canadians?
[3:52:21] X_barley: weve just talked about this forever we're all in agreement
[3:52:25] sandpigeon: here we go again
[3:52:25] hitchmeister59: Chicken on a burger bun is a burger, supposedly.
[3:52:25] Maellin: No. It is not. Never. We don't listen to the English and their insanity. We got our on crazy going on. I can't deal with 2 insanities in my head.
[3:52:27] CochaCR: oh no burger arc again :D
[3:52:28] holyzeke: well you crazy ppl call fries chips
[3:52:28] Gizwix: true
[3:52:31] gsrasslan: but that's the fun part
[3:52:31] khalcrux_gaming: I called it a burger
[3:52:32] KamkazeV2: This conversation is exhausting
[3:52:34] kiewies: Literally Americans called turkey sandwiches turkey burgers so idk why we call them chicken sando and not chicken burger.
[3:52:35] lunakinthedruid: The real question is, is the Chicken Burger better than the Chicken Sandwich?
[3:52:36] astralumi: it's exactly the same as a "burger", but it has chicken in the middle. it's a burger to me :D
[3:52:37] KyleS07: Why is it a burger in the UK?
[3:52:37] Vahs_Redclaw: poll and debate xD
[3:52:37] OatsMate: It's a chicken sandwich if it has less chicken and more additives, but we've marketed it as a chicken sandwich.
[3:52:38] X_barley: the chicken shop incident
[3:52:38] LadyDors: true
[3:52:38] Sockfire: so a burger is not a sandwich?
[3:52:39] kissesaurus: if it has a bun it's a burger!
[3:52:40] jiveyivey: Lol the first time I heard "Chicken Burger" I was soooo confused
[3:52:42] jhopps12: idc what you call it, I just want it inside my stomach
[3:52:44] thunduz: LOL why do people disagree so hard with this?
[3:52:47] drizzeh33: its not a sandwich  its not between sandwich buns
[3:52:47] REKGameZ: i live in north american and call it a burger
[3:52:48] TheSonicDwarf: do hamburgers come from Hamberg (spelling)?
[3:52:55] KyleS07: I'm not shocked. Like Squirty Cream
[3:52:59] Thowarr: @REKGameZ he's not going to listen
[3:53:00] gsrasslan: I didn't mean it as a debate, just as a fun test of how many americans are here
[3:53:02] Yodamoo: To be fair, burgervis a type of meat... Technically chucked burger is objectively wrong, but I call it chicken burger too lol
[3:53:02] skeletonetiquette: Tali can I buy you a chicken burger next Blizzcon? XD
[3:53:09] random_redshirt: Ah, chicken burger is different in the US.  I'd expect a ground meat patty that isn't breaded and fried for a burger, similar to a turkey burger.
[3:53:09] HolocronCoder: I'm more stuck on how google's "correction" for sandwich is still spelled wrong
[3:53:11] funviking99: american logic = 2 pieces of bread with meat i between sandwich,ez LUL
[3:53:16] LarryDean: yeah i call it a chicken sandwich , i wasnt aware it called a chicken burger that cool
[3:53:18] Krogothian: We're all so isolated in that we only talk to other Americans lol
[3:53:18] aeson_of_raid_sock: the audacity
[3:53:19] HSAyril: Looks like a sandwich to me
[3:53:20] khalcrux_gaming: Tali saying I'm not a real American. Should I be hurt?
[3:53:20] Thowarr: From the people who insist on calling it football, we're getting burger
[3:53:24] Sockfire: it's a sandwich
[3:53:29] Mazerbeam: First we need to do a poll on if you're American or not. Then a poll on burger vs sandwich. Take the ratio and that way we truly know which is more popular!
[3:53:30] ScalpelHeals: As a Canadian, did you just assume my nationality?! :P
[3:53:35] Ruus_Taneq: next thing you know you’ll be telling us the rest of the world uses that crazy metric system
[3:53:39] Maellin: Taliesin is rich. We American's are nuts on a general UNIVERSAL level. *sigh*
[3:53:39] hedgehoglet: that’s pretty interesting, I think we must be socially trained to associate the word burger with beef exclusively
[3:53:49] Maellin: *right
[3:53:52] Ciek: americans need more linguistic education
[3:54:04] grimzero617: I'd ask for a #4, or whatever
[3:54:05] viirracocha: agree
[3:54:05] Mazerbeam: I would ask for whatever the menu calls it
[3:54:08] Quackster27: i hate that this is facts
[3:54:09] atamala: eh when in rome
[3:54:10] DiscordianKitty: This is the most groundhog day experience
[3:54:17] holyzeke: you crazy ppl call a flashlight a torch
[3:54:18] viirracocha: the amercians dont want to change their habits
[3:54:19] TheSonicDwarf: is it a burger cause of the bun?
[3:54:20] Sockfire: I never go to Popeyes, but if I do I'll say chicken burger, just for you
[3:54:21] HSAyril: It's not a burger, though :O
[3:54:24] lunakinthedruid: well reading the menu is hard
[3:54:24] Maellin: i wonder how Popeyes adjusts it's recipes in the UK or anywhere else for that matter.
[3:54:25] KeyouiX: to be fair i had no idea it was called a chicken burger till literally just now
[3:54:26] witchhobbit: yeah it's because of hamburger
[3:54:27] steelman55: I can respect it. But its weird.
[3:54:29] Thowarr: @Ciek Oxford Dictionary: /ˈsænwɪtʃ/, /ˈsænwɪdʒ/ (also British English, informal sarnie) two slices of bread, often spread with butter, with a layer of meat, cheese, etc. between them.
[3:54:35] atamala: well a chicken burger in the US is ground chicken
[3:54:36] Thowarr: We're working off this
[3:54:41] Vahs_Redclaw: they would say "i dont even know what a chicken burger is" looking at a description with the picture too
[3:54:43] mattyxoqt: now thats a sandwich
[3:54:44] Vandosz: Thats m,uch better than the burger so no loss
[3:54:46] Jackinthebuff: ive had stream up but couldnt hear because i was on a call, idk whats going on but we been looking and sandies for a hot minute lol
[3:54:48] Reiumi_: put the chicken sandwich burger back on Sadge
[3:54:49] astralumi: now that's a sandwich! :D
[3:54:49] elbardo_ts: I don't know how this is called in Argentina. I wouldn't called it "sandwich de pollo" but I wouldn't call it "hamburguesa de pollo" either. And the places that sell similar things to that are all from the US
[3:54:56] hitchmeister59: Am I right in thinking that a Popeyes in the UK would have a menu on the wall with a picture of that labeled "Chicken Burger?"
[3:54:57] KeyouiX: i would've expected that from a sandwich shop
[3:54:59] Quackster27: google chicken burger
[3:55:01] TheSonicDwarf: is it burger cause of the bun?
[3:55:02] Mazerbeam: I'm a functioning adult, and Popeye's has pictures on their menu, I'll figure it out.
[3:55:07] Krogothian: But if told it's a chicken burger I don't have a problem ordering that. It's just tat as an American I don't interact with other nationalities on a regular basis.
[3:55:12] shivena_: Those sandwiches look delicious, btw.
[3:55:12] Sockfire: There are chicken sandwiches on sourdough here
[3:55:14] gerruler: What I would like to know is how the "ham" in hamburger was ever dropped. Is it just to shorten? or to like not mention the German city?
[3:55:17] TankenFunk: You can tell that it is a sandwich because of the way that it is tneEvi
[3:55:18] lunakinthedruid: true
[3:55:23] astralumi: the bread and how it's assembled
[3:55:31] Co1eCash: It may have to do with the shape  of the protein  honestly   vegetarian pattys are still veggie burgers.
[3:55:31] aeson_of_raid_sock: I now regret starting this lol
[3:55:32] Vandosz: contents of the sandwich are often cold too tho
[3:55:32] Yodamoo: The real question is, is a hot dog a....awww he answered it as I was typing it lol
[3:55:44] HSAyril: Is a hotdog a sandwich?
[3:55:45] slashpuppys: @gerruler Its hamburg-er. like hamburg the city
[3:55:45] databob1: ok so I'll take a chicken burger and that grilled sandwich and a coke
[3:55:48] funviking99: all this talk made me hungry
[3:55:53] funviking99: need a burger
[3:55:58] Krogothian: @Vandosz In the US many sandwiches are hot
[3:56:02] Maellin: @aeson_of_raid_sock It's okay. No regrets
[3:56:02] Vandosz: Hotdog is a broodje knakworst
[3:56:03] Vahs_Redclaw: @funviking99 same
[3:56:06] holyzeke: sandwiches only use bread not a bun
[3:56:10] Sharktribe: I think it's fun how Tali pronounced sandwich as "sandwidj"
[3:56:10] chiseria27: don't forget about bagels
[3:56:16] khalcrux_gaming: Not the hotdog is a sandwich fight
[3:56:17] KeyouiX: so you're sayiing a burger is a type of sandwich
[3:56:18] Mazerbeam: If you put a brat in a hotdog bun, is it now a hotdog?
[3:56:25] funviking99: LUL
[3:56:26] viirracocha: kebab!
[3:56:26] Ace_Trekkie: unless the filling is chips, then its a "Butty" whatever the type of bread is
[3:56:28] hitchmeister59: what about a sub or a hoagie?
[3:56:30] X_barley: make sure you dont miss your big dig Tali!!!
[3:56:32] atamala: so is american BBQ style food in the UK called burgers? like a pulled pork burger?
[3:56:33] khalcrux_gaming: Queens English
[3:56:35] KyleS07: Sangwidges!
[3:56:36] Deatheran: awww fuck @TaliesinAndEvitel youve triggered my kebab sense... going to order one now
[3:56:37] random_redshirt: Yeah, we have chicken burgers in the US, but the patty would be ground meat without breading
[3:56:38] elbardo_ts: is it a burger bun without sesame seeds?
[3:56:38] thunduz: why are beef burgers called HAMburgers
[3:56:39] Krogothian: But isn't it called a burger because of hamburger?
[3:56:42] frankenfoot5: This is really the most effective Popeyes ad I've ever seen. I knew Tali was a #corporateshill ;)
[3:56:44] aeson_of_raid_sock: we invented burgers tho
[3:56:45] TheSonicDwarf: if i put burger patty in a hotdog bun, is it a hotdog
[3:56:49] Vandosz: In the netherlands you can put broodje in front of anything. Burger, sandwich doesnt matter
[3:56:50] grimzero617: Chip butty?
[3:56:52] VerityNS: Watch Americans dispute you that THEY invented sandwiches
[3:56:52] Balen_42: You guys also called it Soccer before Football, but you're not ready for that are you Talie
[3:56:57] Thowarr: @atamala asking the real questions; but he's British so doesn't know that
[3:56:57] DarthTaz0: I had a customer service call from a woman who was irate that the club sandwich at our restaurant didn't have the middle piece of bread and therefore could not be a club sandwich. she said it was false advertising and wanted the chef and her waiter fired for telling her a club sandwich didn't need 3 pieces of bread.
[3:57:00] HSAyril: Didn't China invent sandwiches?
[3:57:04] warrenny: that’s just english tho. real english
[3:57:05] I2ey25: what in the world is a chip butty
[3:57:08] warrenny: wedge? wtf?
[3:57:11] grimzero617: Burgerdog?
[3:57:15] grimzero617: Hotburger?
[3:57:17] Arlaeya: just cheese in a burger bun? cheeseburger? eh? eh?
[3:57:18] Zombisen: in sweden we say sausage with bread ( korv med bröd)
[3:57:19] VerityNS: @Balen_42 No we never called it soccer
[3:57:23] RosieSeren: MrGM just tweeted something
[3:57:24] atamala: so is american BBQ style food in the UK called burgers? like a pulled pork burger?
[3:57:25] Nickhillcomedy: neat
[3:57:27] Vahs_Redclaw: what if you cut a hotdog up and put it in sandwich bread? Kappa
[3:57:30] stonespetty: Don't get him started on French Fries... LOL
[3:57:31] KeyouiX: i'm confuse
[3:57:31] mattyxoqt: if the sausage was in a burger bun it would be a sausage burger
[3:57:33] TheSonicDwarf: i like it
[3:57:33] frankenfoot5: Americans define hot dogs by the meat. If its a sausage its a brat
[3:57:34] Balen_42: @VerityNS Yes, you did
[3:57:38] Mazerbeam: I want to refund my sub after that comment
[3:57:39] Triskelian: What is a "donner" burger? Because here in the US, the only donner I'm familiar with is the Donner Party :D
[3:57:40] RosieSeren: sorryyyy
[3:57:41] FatCatDad48: So, how does a sub/hoagie fit into all this?
[3:57:42] Thowarr: @HSAyril working on generalizations here, the Brits just appropriated that like the rest of their "culture"
[3:57:46] kdubsj: a chicken tender in a hotdog bun is a chickendog
[3:57:50] Madfall_Dewin: I was gone for like 30 minutes and you were still on burgers
[3:57:51] X_barley: thats off of the press site lmfaooooooo

[3:58:25] khalcrux_gaming: Ban them
[3:58:27] Sockfire: tneTayto
[3:58:28] Krogothian: Is a loaf of bread cut into two a bread sandwich or a bread burger based on the direction of the cut?
[3:58:32] X_barley: What if the MrGM tweet was "Just had my evening poo"
[3:58:35] funviking99: this drought is so exhausting BibleThump
[3:58:37] codicier: the vid even says blizzcon :D
[3:58:38] RosieSeren: am I banned now lol
[3:58:41] KyleS07: MrGM trolling us hardcore
[3:58:44] frankenfoot5: Maybe the dialogue/audio is different and it's actually saying "Sargeras and KnifuWaifu are teaming up to take down Dornogol"
[3:58:45] Oliraptor: NotLikeThis
[3:58:46] Reiumi_: so chicken sandwiches

[4:01:15] Krogothian: Evi is a gem
[4:01:40] X_barley: Average wow user upset when a baddie comes across their screen
[4:01:40] Maellin: What is goolish? is this an illiterate attempt at ghoulish?

[4:02:56] mattyxoqt: free speech tho
[4:03:01] alextheblight: tneEviHeart tneEviHeart tneEviHeart

[4:03:28] Nimsh: musk defo goolish
[4:03:28] maulinx: @viirracocha this is hilarious bait well done
[4:03:30] ArkyteCurse: Elon Musk is a fragile little man-boy
[4:03:32] X_barley: Cant wait to play WoW on my fascist brain chip
[4:03:37] HSAyril: That kid that was tracking his flights lol
[4:03:39] Deatheran: Elon has the thinnest skin ive seen from a public figure in a while
[4:03:42] slashpuppys: she is hot, but even tho if she wouldnt be what kind of person would speculate on cancer to bash someones appearance tf
[4:03:46] grimzero617: At 35, I looked WAY worse than that. Of course, I'm also a man
[4:03:52] Maellin: Yeah. Hot Evitel looking -goolish-. Watching Evi giving morons the finger is great. I may "borrow" that pic and use it for responses on X.
[4:03:57] mattyxoqt: I think he needs to stick to electric cars and rockets
[4:04:09] warrenny: free speech doesnt mean freedom from consequences. just from government
[4:04:10] ebrahim_91: Holly <3
[4:04:16] Sharktribe: Maybe they just mispelled "girlish"?
[4:04:18] atamala: if that's ghoulish then i have no idea what i am
[4:04:37] Krogothian: @Sharktribe Calling a woman girlish can be kinda rude too
[4:04:37] Vandosz: Warcraft 4 confirmed
[4:04:39] cyclopsnerd: *eye emoji*
[4:04:48] X_barley: Even just having Jeremy tweet something is crazy feeling
[4:04:56] random_redshirt: Good on Holly!
[4:05:02] RosieSeren: what time is it in america now?
[4:05:11] Krogothian: @RosieSeren Depends what part
[4:05:17] chiseria27: i think they're about to delete all our characters
[4:05:18] kaijoe_: Blue eye samurai! So good
[4:05:20] X_barley: Was it a reply?
[4:05:27] maulinx: its like 10:30 AM at blizz hq
[4:05:39] revan4686: @taliesinandevitel she put a reply to someone’s tweet about trans mog and said sumthin about 10.2.6 in it
[4:05:43] Durwen: they're waiting for you to stop the stream, finger hovering on the release button
[4:05:45] Vandosz: Theyre waiting for you to log off your stream
[4:05:46] X_barley: what about the chicken emoji reply form Holly what do we think?
[4:05:46] funviking99: pirates “expansion”
[4:05:56] jurassic_rabbit: Was Holly's response a chicken emoji?
[4:06:10] grimzero617: Surely no announce after 10 pst
[4:06:18] X_barley: COOKING 2.0!!!!!
[4:06:18] kissesaurus: one piece colab inc!
[4:06:25] RosieSeren: its actually just chickens
[4:06:25] slashpuppys: playerhousing with chicken coop pls
[4:06:28] MeggoArt: peak shitposter holly
[4:06:35] X_barley: no just the meat on a bone
[4:06:41] thunduz: pirates
[4:06:49] manmower: might be the WoW:One Piece crossover
[4:06:51] jurassic_rabbit: Holly is troll-goals. :)
[4:06:55] Krogothian: It's a chicken sandwich reference
[4:07:01] revan4686: @taliesinandevitel she loves to but a fox in with the chickens for sure
[4:07:04] SpacedemonX: Blizz just released some news but its Diablo related.
[4:07:04] Nulgar: ugh, would love pirates, but would hate too many Anime references - Anime didn't invent pirates
[4:07:05] Saiyori: it's a stretch but it could be the chicken from moana
[4:07:08] atamala: @Krogothian or chicken burger? hmmge
[4:07:13] Arlaeya: clearly zombievampiratechickens
[4:07:13] tyclonic: maybe it means “Cooked” since the leg is a Cooke chicken
[4:07:15] X_barley: Holly and Jeremy go to Popeye's
[4:07:18] kissesaurus: @Saiyori OH SHIIII
[4:07:23] magemaster225: its a rooster emote, rooster mount inc
[4:07:38] X_barley: It's either today or Tuesday let's be real
[4:07:38] Sharktribe: Yo did you guys watch Nimona? It's so good. I loved the comic but holy crap the movie
[4:07:48] Vandosz: Do gilnean vendors sell chicken sandwich or chicken burger. asking the real questions
[4:07:48] Trebled_Mind: tneSuperM1 tneSuperM2
[4:07:48] codicier: I think tali right now you are probably realising how every football reporter feels on transfer deadline day
[4:07:51] jurassic_rabbit: @X_barley that has to be it. they're chatting about what they're doing for lunch
[4:08:01] Trebled_Mind: tneSuperM4
[4:08:09] mattyxoqt: thats a cat burger
[4:08:12] duat_auru: all this pirate stuff, are we getting player housing or player houseboats
[4:08:25] pagan_pg: They're going to Long John Silver's for Chicken Burgers
[4:08:54] xxbranflakes: My favorite part of the pirates patch is when they said "it's pirate time" and pirated all over those guys
[4:09:04] grimzero617: Long John Silver's can't be a legitimate company. I never see customers at one
[4:09:07] Maellin: @duat_auru ooh. A houseboat! We could be like...a trailer park on the high seas doing house boat convoys while drunk.
[4:09:11] X_barley: Can I be a shit to Mike Ybarra?
[4:09:24] viirracocha: hopefully some news about their Nextflix anime show, maybe a show on pirates  :)
[4:09:31] RosieSeren: love the idea of player houseboats
[4:09:36] TankenFunk: BASED
[4:09:39] X_barley: True... but the idea of it feels nice
[4:09:40] duat_auru: @Maellin thousand needles here we come
[4:09:45] kaijoe_: But it’s all about the hyper-growth opportunities
[4:09:45] Quackster27: DAYUM
[4:10:05] puntualus: eiyaDance eiyaDance eiyaDance
[4:10:18] puntualus: I believe in Tali tneTaliWasRight
[4:10:18] manmower: based on timing and the skull and bones, probably a valentine's update
[4:10:19] X_barley: So funny that they think they've never heard this feedback lol
[4:10:32] Nulgar: yes, because the holiday event bosses currently does not drop anything....
[4:10:35] KamkazeV2: Sorry, didnt she insert herself by saying "she doesnt seem the problem"? Or did I misread that on my 2nd monitor?
[4:10:40] RosieSeren: why do they think holly decides these things?
[4:10:41] maulinx: it's so weird that people do that on literally every tweet these people make like were you raised in a barn, don't you have any social skills whatsoever
[4:10:44] Vaephera: I find it hard to be that mad about microtransactions, I feel like we're getting more transmog, and more variety, than ever as part of the base game
[4:11:06] Vaephera: Especially as this one is just a recolour
[4:11:13] slashpuppys: I'm not a fan of the shop but I'm so confused why people are so bad, mictrotransaction have been a part of the game since classic/tbc
[4:11:27] X_barley: She's complimenting the mog very clearly
[4:11:28] slashpuppys: *mad
[4:11:29] Mazerbeam: Her job is to make Blizzard money :D
[4:11:30] alextheblight: wow devs all work in the same department, don't ya know
[4:11:44] mattyxoqt: its banter
[4:11:47] Krogothian: Yeah, it's a compliment on the mog
[4:11:51] KamkazeV2: But "the problem" is purchasing mogs
[4:11:51] Nulgar: @KamkazeV2 it's tongue-in-cheek
[4:12:06] slashpuppys: yeah, but reading comprehension is a problem on twitter like fr
[4:12:08] Yamakirk: Firings aside, Holly and all of the survivors still have to go back to work, make the game, and keep their job. Behind their positive tweets they're more devastated than any of us here in chat
[4:12:18] grimzero617: "Nobody can have fun if I'm not having fun"
[4:12:23] caradosailanthus: Some of the mog is really cute and playful.  Really like it.
[4:12:36] ArkyteCurse: He clearly says HE is the problem, so her saying "I don't see a problem" is her saying HE isn't a problem playing off his joke. It's pretty clear to anyone with any sort of reading comprehension ability
[4:12:46] Mazerbeam: I personally don't see the problem, if people are giving relevant feedback in a civilized manner.
[4:12:49] thunduz: 100%
[4:12:51] KamkazeV2: For the record, I don't condone people harassing devs on twitter. I also feel like she kind of stuck her neck out by engaging in that, but I do agree with your sentiment.
[4:13:01] holyzeke: bell just went live on YouTube maybe he got news
[4:13:07] manmower: if you put stuff on internet isn't it to present to rest of world?
[4:13:10] warrenny: tone and context are important
[4:13:11] slashpuppys: @Mazerbeam Yeah but do it to the right people and not individuals on twitter :O
[4:13:16] maulinx: how is interacting with posts "sticking her neck out" i don't understand this
[4:14:09] thunduz: this is why we can't have fun
[4:14:19] maulinx: is holly in control of MTX and MTX implementation or something
[4:14:21] DozlaT: i mean, anime pfp opinion disregarded
[4:14:31] Mazerbeam: @slashpuppys I don't understand how she is not the right person
[4:14:44] Krogothian: I don't doubt all the crap that Holly has to take regularly though. She's got to be pretty tough for her position and I respect her for it.
[4:14:55] KyleS07: That's cuz you're a liberal commie
[4:14:56] slashpuppys: @Mazerbeam it's her personal account, not the business account?
[4:15:03] vlaovich88: Holly isn't one of the people making the choice to do micro transactions. I could be wrong but she seems like the wrong person to go after.
[4:15:07] KyleS07: Joking btw. YHou'
[4:15:24] bassomar: I for one don't care at all, the only reason I didn't buy this is because I just don't like the transmog or the mount. And it is coming to trading post in a few months.
[4:15:47] slashpuppys: I don't know, I feel it's weird in general to go peoples private accounts if there are brand accounts
[4:15:53] gryffiest: I’m holding out until it comes to the trading post
[4:16:19] DozlaT: ew they have a 2016 sjw pfp
[4:16:21] gulrakrurs: Yelling at the dev over mtx is like not tipping at a restaurant because you think the owner should pay better
[4:16:22] lonesomecowboy: also she is probably talking about a separate “problem” than Matt is referring to he’s talking about Microtransactions I think she’s seen so much stuff yesterday about the “girlification” of wow she’s going like hey nah not a problem is my guess but idk
[4:16:28] X_barley: that's a bait account
[4:16:41] TheDeekins: chatters, imagine everyone knew what you did for a living and constantly @'ed you about it on Twitter even if you have no control over their issue.  sounds pretty miserable
[4:16:48] Teddimijia: they follow 4 ppl
[4:16:52] grimzero617: It's an AI bot
[4:16:53] HolocronCoder: That name though
[4:17:12] slashpuppys: @TheDeekins yeah exactly, i think thats super weird? just go to the brand account if you have something to say
[4:17:18] X_barley: harassment account probably more apt youre right
[4:17:28] VerityNS: If it is a bait account they suck at it
[4:17:39] Teddimijia: i think of bait and harassment accounts as often the same
[4:17:48] mattyxoqt: very angry person
[4:17:56] xxbranflakes: I avoided using Twitter for years started using it in the last year. It's definitely had negativite impact on my mental health
[4:17:57] maulinx: that person should prob be on a list
[4:18:02] X_barley: LUL
[4:18:03] Krogothian: Oof
[4:18:04] Reiumi_: LOL
[4:18:04] atamala: eh oh
[4:18:04] DozlaT: LuL
[4:18:06] SphericFormula: True
[4:18:06] flem_wow: wait mrgm posted a zone preview is that bait
[4:18:07] MeggoArt: LUL
[4:18:11] Triskelian: Wait. They harassed DEMETERNOTH????? 🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬
[4:18:11] atamala: zinger
[4:18:19] sScottyKarate: clip it and send it to him lol
[4:18:21] Sharktribe: TI hate chuds so much
[4:18:34] ChrisStoll: Dan loves the bait
[4:18:42] flem_wow: that's showbiz baby
[4:18:46] Teddimijia: ahhh. i see what you mean
[4:18:46] RosieSeren: I just got my taregosa staff!
[4:18:47] aeson_of_raid_sock: what is mrgm’s tweet about the news going to be?
[4:18:47] Krogothian: Tali makes custom thumbnails. Bait account.
[4:18:55] avatos_94: i know of harrassment accounts but what are bait accounts? just baiting people to talk shit to each other?
[4:19:10] kissesaurus: luaJAM
[4:19:11] Triskelian: @rosieseren Grats!!!!!
[4:19:16] cyclopsnerd: this patch will be one of the better patches
[4:19:35] jimbowheat: A beta count?
[4:19:39] SphericFormula: He's a parrot and that's perfectly okay
[4:19:54] Deatheran: @TaliesinAndEvitel i kind of expect them to not release news during the AWC.
[4:20:40] DozlaT: ppl like that are sad, gamergate was 10 yrs ago give it up already
[4:20:48] Teddimijia: honestly. its rather sad that ppl take the time to sit down and go "ima spend my time harassing ppl" rather than....doing....*anything* else
[4:20:55] thunduz: and his new pc is smoother
[4:21:05] VerityNS: But does he have a WIFE Tali?
[4:21:10] databob1: Ok his baby is cute...but I wouldn't say she's a better baby
[4:21:10] X_barley: MrGM your swag is too different, your tweets engagement levels are too high! They'll kill you!
[4:21:13] VerityNS: HOT*
[4:21:19] Krogothian: But MrGM doesn't have amazing conversations about chicken sandwiches
[4:21:27] warrenny: your great too tali
[4:21:30] Vandosz: I remember watching mr gm when he was doing porivate server stuff back in the day
[4:21:39] slashpuppys: MrGM works super hard tbh, I feel like he doesnt take enough time to rest lmao
[4:21:41] shych00: Game recognises game
[4:22:17] thunduz: so many pirate stuff going on
[4:22:20] HSAyril: Ask your inside contacts >_>
[4:22:23] databob1: News would be nice
[4:22:27] DozlaT: ah yes, word of tshirts
[4:22:30] SirBarracuda: Just got a blizz e-mail about the Parrot Prime Gaming item, thats kinda news
[4:22:45] HSAyril: Haha
[4:22:49] X_barley: Shame Tali got blacklisted by Blizzarrd 😔
[4:22:57] thunduz: better way to say that comment. Have Evi ask her inside contacts LOL
[4:23:07] djalminnha: Y
[4:23:08] elbardo_ts: imagine if they posted something like 2 hours ago and chat just decided to not tell you about it
[4:23:08] d2darkalliance: tali patch news is up!
[4:23:08] alextheblight: looks like it
[4:23:10] random_redshirt: I think that's Hurricane
[4:23:12] shych00: Pirate stufff...? Is that why Mike Ybara had to go...?
[4:23:12] Vandosz: Not hurricane this one
[4:23:12] databob1: Whens the news? fuck you that's when
[4:23:17] djalminnha: hurricane all the way
[4:23:22] Elrathir: I think this was IKedit?
[4:23:38] HSAyril: Got 'em?
[4:23:42] d2darkalliance: sorry tali I lied :)
[4:23:46] X_barley: now thats bait

[4:24:35] X_barley: Player housing
[4:24:43] SphericFormula: Ratchet
[4:24:44] MeggoArt: no it was rachet
[4:24:47] cyclopsnerd: was it booty bay i thought it was ratchet
[4:24:48] xcvbnm1515: Rachet
[4:24:49] Sockfire: I think it was ratchet
[4:24:49] djalminnha: ratchet
[4:24:50] Arlaeya: Ratchet
[4:24:50] KyleS07: Rachet
[4:24:52] Trebled_Mind: Anduin after that booty
[4:24:53] databob1: I missed that
[4:24:57] Vandosz: couldve taken the ship
[4:24:58] Sharktribe: An HD Booty Bay revamp would be so nice- those buildings are so n64-era and janky
[4:25:00] mattyxoqt: i miss booty bay
[4:25:02] DeadlyKitten17: heading south.
[4:25:03] KyleS07: Still a pirate town
[4:25:05] DozlaT: pirate adjacent
[4:25:07] thunduz: Anduin is a Booty Bae
[4:25:14] kaijoe_: but he’s probably heading down to Silithus
[4:25:14] KyleS07: Yes
[4:25:15] Krogothian: Could be booty bay and ratchet
[4:25:16] djalminnha: y
[4:25:18] Durwen: yes
[4:25:18] MeggoArt: yes
[4:25:18] djalminnha: ship
[4:25:20] VerityNS: yes
[4:25:20] crazidaizi: yes boat
[4:25:21] Arlaeya: yeah the boat!
[4:25:21] random_redshirt: Yeah, both cartel towns
[4:25:24] jimbowheat: ship straight there
[4:25:26] PaSchTM: You can. But it was told he was heading south.
[4:25:28] Saiyori: wrathion could prob fly him
[4:25:34] kaijoe_: He’s def heading to the sword
[4:25:36] Triskelian: You do deal with pirates 8n some of the Ratchet questing
[4:25:38] Vandosz: Isnt that just pirates day
[4:25:45] cyclopsnerd: @Saiyori i hope they meet up again
[4:25:45] Sharktribe: Yeah Booty Bay <--> Ratchet is the best place to take over on warmode and slaughter travelers
[4:25:58] Arlaeya: @Saiyori he did promise in Warcrimes
[4:26:04] viirracocha: ye, jump in a cannon at the docks and shot pirates ships
[4:26:05] KyleS07: My guild is on Nymue
[4:26:20] databob1: Hmmm why would Manduin be doing in booty Bay?   ;) ;) ;)
[4:26:29] Baron_Colvin: My guild just start council last week, how do you feel about the healing?
[4:27:00] warrenny: my guild working on hc fyrakk (ive killedit already)
[4:27:02] databob1: Worst content drought ever
[4:27:09] Krogothian: WoW Beta season is the best season
[4:28:06] huffy_bird: My (personal) interpretation of the Anduin chat was sort of to set up the cinematic where Thrall goes to see him in Silithus. They mention that the should let Jaina know, and that kinda ties in with the mage portal that Thrall appears through. He's used Ratchet as a stopping of point on his way there sort of thing.
[4:28:20] slashpuppys: not the vulpera
[4:28:37] Krogothian: Just jealous you can't travel to your camp
[4:28:44] NTB92: have i missed any news in the last 1 hour 30???
[4:29:01] KyleS07: Neg
[4:29:02] Sharktribe: My worgen characters are jealous of vulpera, who get to have tails
[4:29:05] Elrathir: tali hates foxes clodagCry clodagCry clodagCry
[4:29:06] Vandosz: Thats not hurricane
[4:29:11] Triskelian: What's with the Vulpera hate Tali?
[4:29:21] Vandosz: IKedit maybe
[4:29:27] Sharktribe: Maybe someone in-house
[4:29:30] genrlnoobington: genrlnoobington subscribed at Tier 1. 
[4:29:56] Vandosz: I know hurricane is making some cool shit i saw some of it, theres an interesting video hes making atm
[4:29:58] Elrathir: it's IKedit, they say in the description on the youtube video
[4:30:06] X_barley: I did my part for halfling peen
[4:30:28] random_redshirt: That makes sense, IKedit has also done event trailers in the past
[4:30:39] Thesummerofkevin: Did you guys see the pirate hat on mmo champ? is that new?
[4:30:41] TheDeekins: they are literally waiting for you to go offline
