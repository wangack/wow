[0:13:47] ChrisarN: You think gilneas will be a new main city?
[0:14:06] databob1: Michigan is snowbound
[0:14:27] WochiTV: :)
[0:14:35] Haestoh: @databob1 But the lions won!
[0:14:37] databob1: No it kinda sucks
[0:14:41] Eliddinn: twmHey
[0:14:51] Manthieus: Ahh shucks...
[0:14:57] Big_Rum: So i came in late to this twitter douche. Glad he got banned Did he make a death threat at you?
[0:15:22] databob1: I'm sure ot will be good
[0:15:53] lyreilla: That's horrible
[0:16:19] databob1: Damn someone woke up and chose violence
[0:16:22] Big_Rum: Loved how the community surronened you though
[0:16:23] BritishRaven: a hammer to the head doesnâ€™t sound like an ideal way to spend a Monday considering NHS wait times
[0:16:40] Larkaro: I just got here. what happened
[0:17:00] ChrisarN: Any news on phase 2 and STV PvP?
[0:17:22] Haestoh: I saw that and started doing some digging. Might have found his WoW char name, if you wanted to take it further...
[0:17:31] Haestoh: track ip's n shit
[0:18:07] Implied_Slight: D:
[0:18:09] Big_Rum: Yews death threats are illigal
[0:18:18] Larkaro: Sorry you have to go through this
[0:18:19] Implied_Slight: damn, sorry to hear that happens to you
[0:18:22] lyreilla: That's just crap, some people just behavior wise is disappointing. How dumb of these ppl
[0:19:11] Big_Rum: Did you play well at the mini golf? Any holesin one?
[0:19:13] Haestoh: Fuck that dude, but maybe stay away from B&Q for a couple of weeks mrgmOk
[0:19:15] Lausten: Some people need to learn that actions have consequences.. Glad you reported them to the police.
[0:19:21] WochiTV: :D
[0:19:44] MediumRareOG: DanCon Epcott 2024 Let's go
[0:19:47] databob1: @mrgm you really don't deserve this crap
[0:20:22] WochiTV: indeed indeed
[0:20:49] Haestoh: That's a pretty good deal
[0:20:50] WochiTV: we will :D
[0:21:18] Big_Rum: Also you can call a few food trucks in your area and have them set up outside the venue then food is taken care of. It litterally costs you nothing
[0:23:05] lyreilla: That's pretty neat
[0:23:08] databob1: Nice
[0:23:16] WochiTV: yup indeed it is
[0:23:43] Haestoh: Exciting!
[0:23:58] WochiTV: yeah
[0:24:05] Demeternoth: yes!
[0:24:07] WochiTV: they will buy tickets
[0:24:10] Demeternoth: also, HAI
[0:24:20] WochiTV: hey deme
[0:24:20] BritishRaven: tickets for an entire day out? absolutely
[0:24:31] Demeternoth: yes they will buy them - it covers the cost of the venue at a minimum
[0:24:32] auberji: tickets would be required for like health and safety - max capacity etc
[0:24:34] Big_Rum: 20 quid and have all of the streamers promote it on their streams
[0:24:37] Haestoh: Tickets, reach out for sponsors, local game and card shops ask them  if they wanna set up a stall.
[0:24:42] MediumRareOG: Ultimately all events start with "would people even buy tickets to this?"
[0:24:48] Demeternoth: hey @WochiTV :)
[0:25:11] stellabellas: mrgmLuna morning
[0:25:13] auberji: I've been to a few crowd funded events
[0:25:16] Big_Rum: think about twitch con... its like 200 foir it 20 isnt a lot
[0:25:42] Haestoh: Whats capacity?
[0:25:47] Haestoh: at the veune
[0:25:51] Haestoh: venue
[0:26:01] MediumRareOG: You could Kickstarter it
[0:26:11] Big_Rum: maybe 200 people mac
[0:26:13] Big_Rum: max
[0:26:25] MediumRareOG: Check fire codes for maximum capacity. That'll be your limiting factor
[0:26:34] WochiTV: that would be cool indeed
[0:26:49] Haestoh: for round numbers say its 100 people, if you sold 80 tickets at Â£10 a pop, cover your venue costs and have 20 comp tickets for free, friends and family, sponsers/vendor tickets ect.
[0:27:02] Layliah79: mrgmHelloThere Happy Monday!
[0:27:39] Big_Rum: Be cool if Sco came and Preach as well

[0:28:36] Layliah79: Oh i know!!
[0:29:07] Lausten: Baby gulp? LUL
[0:29:16] Layliah79: It would be wonderful! I'd watch 100% cause being in US I couldn't attend lol
[0:29:26] Layliah79: TOMORROW!
[0:29:29] MediumRareOG: With any space, always ask maximum capacity. That'll be limited by law (fire codes)
[0:29:39] Haestoh: Sounds like a promising start. Excited to see how things develop
[0:29:51] Thoreya: df hype

[0:36:24] Layliah79: I'm not a cowboys fan but def not a packers fan either. so i didn't mind the cowboys winning yesterday.
[0:36:31] neverbornlucky: epcot is now sending warning to texans not to use their heaters between 7am to 10am because we might stress the grid but it was ok for them to use the electric power during cowboys games

[0:37:58] COOP3R: you cant lol
[0:38:03] Big_Rum: Yeah Just Epcot for Flower and Garden before we go on our cruise to the DR
[0:38:25] TruVillainManny: Hello Mister GM

[0:43:07] Smurflord: I was annoyed that I couldn't make "Wochicon" due to my surgery last year, but will be fighting fit for any events this year. :)
[0:43:57] Big_Rum: So i was watching some footage from Blizzcon. A core memory of mine is meeting Annie. Of all the creators who I met that I didn't already have a friendship with she was the coolest and so nice.
[0:44:13] TruVillainManny: If it becomes inexpensive i could see a use for transparent TV's

[0:54:57] VesperalTV: yeah im from bournemouth, had some good nights out
[0:55:01] databob1: Ouch man
[0:55:04] auberji: is the one that was in a church still there?
[0:55:06] physalis4: The big giant in this zone is the Fel Reaver of Wrath
[0:55:11] VesperalTV: @auberji yea
[0:55:19] databob1: !emote DinoDance
[0:55:40] auberji: I went uni there, liked living there.
[0:56:11] VesperalTV: i definitely took it for granted, its a nice place especially in summer
[0:56:28] snagprophet: yeah the church
[0:56:33] auberji: the regal
[0:56:47] snagprophet: it used to have a hot tub upstairs but people kept having sex in it and they got rid of it
[0:56:51] alicemch: theres a spoons where i live that has music after 9pm
[0:56:58] snagprophet: wait til you see a nightclub inside a mosque

[0:58:04] TruVillainManny: That's when the beat drops

[0:58:44] snagprophet: I think it was people going to a synagogue during covid
[0:58:54] auberji: my favourite was the bloke that thought he was going mad hearing yiddish under his floorboards
[0:59:05] Haestoh: A dude tweeted some months ago about hearing jews under his floorboards
[0:59:10] MediumRareOG: There's a video of a Hasidic Jewish man appearing from a hole in the sidewalk, pushing the guy with the camera then running away. It's the funniest thing
[0:59:24] snagprophet: it sounds like a scenario Borat would describe happening
[0:59:26] Airt1: pretty sure that was a fake tweet, still funny though
[0:59:32] MediumRareOG: That "yiddish under the floor boards" is fake. The guy is a huge anti-semite
[0:59:45] auberji: bummer
[1:00:37] Airt1: ^weird comment mate
[1:00:50] MachoCham: I'm not certain, and I'm not Jewish but I thought the Y word was frowned upon
[1:01:05] BritishRaven: I lost at least 6 braincells
[1:01:19] capncolbeer: ???
[1:01:22] cyoelke: good morning!
[1:01:28] MediumRareOG: @MachoCham Yiddish? Yiddish is a language
[1:01:41] Haestoh: Anyway............. Do you think Seth is dropping the belt tonight on RAW?
[1:02:02] Airt1: Jinder is getting hindered
[1:02:29] MachoCham: @MediumRareOG Sorry my bad, it's the shortened form
[1:02:45] MachoCham: I love the reports of him getting over with the back office for trolling TK
[1:03:04] Smurflord: I think he meant that there's an issue online with people conflating being against Israel government policy with being against the jews, which is an obvious false-equivalency. He could have phrased it a lot better.
[1:03:05] Cabbageman007: Gilneas PTR ..looks like we can set hearthstone there at the inn?
[1:03:21] Airt1: wrestling is 90% casuals, remember when Punk made a sly remark about a backstage fight in one of his return promos and *crickets*
[1:03:24] MachoCham: Yep, Austin about to get hit by a Car and Hunter marries her
[1:03:47] Smurflord: yeah Dan, I remember that Raw with HHH and steph. Watching it live :D
[1:04:08] MachoCham: I DID IT FO DA ROCK
[1:04:34] Airt1: I DID IT FO DA PEOPLE

[1:05:44] MachoCham: We're still in the shitty Bossman vs Big Shows Daddy bit atm
[1:05:55] JakeSezz: I was at the post-Survivor Series Raw in â€˜98 after The Rock went corporate. so much damn fun
[1:06:01] BritishRaven: Speaking of old wrestling, I managed to find an authentic original shiek autograph for my sabu collection; his uncle and trainer. Set me back a pretty penny!
[1:06:11] VesperalTV: looking forward to p2 of sod
[1:06:11] MachoCham: Nice!
[1:06:49] MachoCham: I need you to come back to SoD to form me some dungeon groups

[1:07:19] dwolf010: do you think we will learn some 10.2.6 this week?
[1:08:15] Thoreya: they are bad
[1:08:20] Thoreya: compared to this m+ season
[1:08:25] BBMezzy: I wouldn't be surprised if the pirate patch includes BfA timewalking
[1:08:28] MachoCham: Fine, have Grimrail
[1:08:30] physalis4: some are just so punishing
[1:08:46] TruVillainManny: TW Islands?
[1:08:47] Sery_Bot: The ad break is finishing now! seryboLove
[1:08:48] MediumRareOG: Dan, did you see follower dungeons will have a 10 a day cap?
[1:09:09] Smurflord: People always hate change and anything new. :(
[1:09:19] Larkaro: What are your thought on SOD being canon in the wow timeline
[1:09:26] auberji: I'd say anti-botting measure if you didn't just you know, multi box
[1:09:41] MachoCham: I feel it's 10 a day cap to stop any exploiting
[1:09:48] TruVillainManny: 10 in a day is more than most would hit
[1:10:28] Lausten: Only thing that makes sense is botting prevention mesasures
[1:10:39] MachoCham: Dunno, might be easy to automate to queue and then just follow etc
[1:10:57] StreamElements: EVERYTHING Coming in Patch 10.2.5 "Seeds of Renewal" | Dragonflight - https://youtu.be/RVe32RozJGM
[1:10:59] Airt1: i doubt they'll go that far
[1:11:02] snagprophet: depends what part is canon, like the questlines surrounding the rune acquisition?
[1:11:08] Lausten: On the other hand, they could have allowed to do 500 and then ban anyone doing above a realistic measure like 25 daily. LUL

[1:11:30] TruVillainManny: TW visions of NZoth
[1:11:30] MachoCham: Multiverse. Explains everything, can do what they want
[1:11:31] Airt1: term i keep hearing used is "found footage" basically "this was also happening at the time but it wasn't seen"
[1:11:36] qbert292: Good morninh
[1:11:57] neverbornlucky: cata dungeons were hard in the day but how will they be compared to now with this player base ?
[1:12:04] snagprophet: not sure what to make of BFD being a raid being canon, seems more like the same way affixes is gameplay rather than canon
[1:12:17] MachoCham: It will run on the later builds when they were nerfed a bit
[1:13:09] Smurflord: WoW needs a "WHAT IF....?" series
[1:13:46] TruVillainManny: It would be a timeline where Midivh would have to more directly work against the kingdoms of Azeroth.
[1:13:48] snagprophet: WoW's "What If" is just the Bronze dragon quests
[1:14:08] RAF_Sean: Mornin DAn, how's things
[1:14:19] auberji: It'd be interesting to see them use that to do like the original Star Wars scripts like they did with the "The Star Wars" a few years back
[1:14:28] RAF_Sean: Nice nice
[1:14:32] RAF_Sean: When are you thinking?
[1:14:34] TruVillainManny: I would really like to see the further explore those worlds introduced in time rifts
[1:14:43] RAF_Sean: Fuck
[1:14:50] neverbornlucky: MrGm two products at CES I saw that could make its way to gaemer. One was the bralecet that read the  nerve  movement . Imagine that as a keybind keypad type gamer controller
[1:14:51] RAF_Sean: Wife is gone for the whole back half of May ><
[1:14:57] MediumRareOG: I want an alternate universe of shadowlands that isn't terrible
[1:15:20] neverbornlucky: The other was some deal they had wire wise on the fingers that could almost replace a  keyboard
[1:15:36] TruVillainManny: Also special hunter alternate version wherein your pet tames you!
[1:16:03] MediumRareOG: will we ever get a scouting map of the dragon isles?
[1:16:51] MachoCham: Scouting Maps will be G-O-N-N-E GONNNEEE
[1:17:16] MachoCham: Happy 60k spent guise <3
[1:17:22] physalis4: do they have one for DF yet.
[1:17:56] StreamElements: dracJAM TWITCH PRIME dracJAM
[1:18:30] Smurflord: I can't wait until we can mog farm in this old instances across all classes
[1:18:48] physalis4: I think it takes a longtime to get everything
[1:19:07] Lausten: Yeah I've more or less put all my instance mog farms on a hold until TWW
[1:19:26] TruVillainManny: There is a mount that is pally only as well
[1:19:28] neverbornlucky: what do you think about devices meant for the disabled on computers being brought into wow type games to make things easier for farming dungeons ?
[1:20:07] MachoCham: I think humans will take the path of least resistance
[1:20:14] MachoCham: And this isn't anything new
[1:20:22] Smurflord: I hope they keep the voice actor for Xalatath. Always happy to hear ex-Babylon 5 actors turns up in things :D
[1:20:45] snagprophet: xdd
[1:20:45] physalis4: itâ€™s a show
[1:20:46] RAF_Sean: Old TV series
[1:20:55] RAF_Sean: It was DS9 before DS9
[1:20:58] physalis4: like Star Trek
[1:21:08] capncolbeer: Old Sci-Fi
[1:21:15] MediumRareOG: I'd be surprised if they let us use class mounts. If they do, I guess I have to do all the legion class hall mounts
[1:21:27] MachoCham: Babylon 5 100% sounds like a mid noughties rockpop band
[1:21:53] capncolbeer: at most, you could unlock not equip the class mounts on an off-class
[1:22:44] MachoCham: I was sad that I can't use Tarecgosa mount on chars without the Staff PepeHands
[1:23:43] dwolf010: when do you think the first war within alpha build (dataminable) drops?
[1:23:59] UlthraneDK: UlthraneDK subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 21 months! Cheers, Legend.
[1:24:29] UlthraneDK: Doin good, other than back to the office!
[1:24:36] alicemch: oh man the music in here is wild
[1:24:38] neverbornlucky: MrGm I believe the term for them is called EMG wristbands . There were a few at CES that looked like it could be cool for wow
[1:24:47] alicemch: yep
[1:24:48] MachoCham: Late Feb/Mid March is my guess to increase hype and thus sub numbers before end of quarter
[1:24:57] UlthraneDK: ICC patch was legit
[1:25:15] Sery_Bot: A 90 second ad break is starting! Thank you for sticking with us through this break! seryboLove Ads help support my content. Consider subscribing to remove ads and support the stream!
[1:25:41] MachoCham: Oh I know but there must be a correlation between people coming back when there is alpha release
[1:25:52] Lausten: You're a trusted wow partner though right? You should get in
[1:26:34] UlthraneDK: Holly will hook you up
[1:26:41] Thoreya: u think this time around ull only get invited to beta if u prepurchase? i got into the last 2 betas..might have to prepurchase this time around
[1:26:46] Sery_Bot: The ad break is finishing now! seryboLove
[1:26:56] neverbornlucky: oh also MrGm msi claw will be first non -steam deck handheld that has steamOS on it coming out
[1:27:06] MachoCham: Everyone wants Alpha and Beta access until they get Alpha and Beta access
[1:27:10] TruVillainManny: I feel like the systems are so shallow that investigating them is a much faster experience
[1:28:24] physalis4: people were rabid about DF Beta
[1:28:29] Thoreya: i played soooo much DF beta lol
[1:28:33] Thoreya: compared to sl
[1:28:37] MachoCham: I feel attacked
[1:28:37] TruVillainManny: The other part is that another part of it is shut behind encryption
[1:28:39] MediumRareOG: People log on to alpha/beta once, check out their character and then never log in again
[1:28:43] auberji: i got beta for WoTLK, tried dk then logged till it was released lol
[1:28:44] neverbornlucky: I do not want the alpha or beta of retail or classic lol
[1:29:10] TruVillainManny: Yeah I think I need to find some people who will be dedicated because I want to test all the things
[1:29:30] MachoCham: But addon's won't be enabled for a little while
[1:29:31] MachoCham: Kappa
[1:30:03] Lausten: Just hope they get enough feedback on the Warbands to not make some stupid mistakes that will take another 20 years to fix..
[1:31:00] tanman2394: Iâ€™m not
[1:31:02] fizzle_wizard: Me
[1:31:04] tanman2394: shits a grind
[1:31:04] UlthraneDK: People in my guild aren't and I find it wild at this point
[1:31:11] calphan84: i've maxed them on 3 chars
[1:31:12] Akela3: i just couldn't stand doing niffen
[1:31:16] Demeternoth: yep i have not, the only faction I'm maxed with is the Dream Wardens
[1:31:19] Harai_Ulfsark: i have max renown with like 7 characters now KEKWAIT
[1:31:21] capncolbeer: I'm not, but I'm an altoholic
[1:31:22] Lausten: I hope they make gold account wide and not character bound with an option to deposit it into the warband bank cause thats a "bandaid" change..
[1:31:23] LindirTV: swapped main in vault, and never bothered with renown since then
[1:31:25] MediumRareOG: I only maxed Renown when the 50% buff happened, otherwise I doubt I would've
[1:31:26] StreamElements: Check out my Socials! dracJAM  https://twitter.com/MrGMYT https://www.instagram.com/danmrgm https://www.patreon.com/MrGM https://discord.gg/MrGM https://www.youtube.com/c/MrGMYT https://www.tiktok.com/@mrgm_warcraft
[1:31:27] TruVillainManny: While it's not renown, I haven't capped Cobalt nor the language one.
[1:31:44] MediumRareOG: Niffen sucks to grind. Maruuk Centaur too actually
[1:31:50] UlthraneDK: If renown was contributed by all your characters, everyone would be likely
[1:31:57] JakeSezz: The only toon Iâ€™m maxed out on is my lvl 70 boosted Monk mrgmKEKW
[1:32:01] Harai_Ulfsark: i need to farm cobalt with my other alts for crafting recipes :(
[1:32:10] physalis4: The Furblog rep takes like an hour to get to max
[1:32:15] MachoCham: Think everything is capped
[1:32:25] beezelebaub: hi hi ^^ would you recommend the zygor guide for loremaster?
[1:32:34] fizzle_wizard: Best way to do renown just dailies? Or running through quests to full completion in each area? Only played in first season DF and now catching up.
[1:32:36] MachoCham: !zygor
[1:32:36] StreamElements: I am using Zygor for my in-game Guides! You can get 20% off Zygor when you use the code "MrGM" and use my link https://zygorguides.com/ref/MrGM/
[1:32:43] beezelebaub: cool, tyvm ^^
[1:32:43] MediumRareOG: As an aside, can Blizzard stop giving us tokens we trade for rep like the hunting trophies? Just give us the rep
[1:33:11] MachoCham: I want tokens that I can use. the hand in part can piss off tho
[1:33:16] Valestrus: afternoon :D
[1:33:38] TruVillainManny: but tokens are more powerful. Each week I hold the tokens till reset and then instantly complete my weekly rep quests.
[1:33:38] Valestrus: all good
[1:33:39] MediumRareOG: @MachoCham true
[1:33:41] Valestrus: work work
[1:34:14] MediumRareOG: Also, why do we have Awakened and Rousing Fire that turn into each other? It's annoying. Just use Rousing Fire
[1:34:22] MachoCham: I'd assume SW/Org
[1:35:02] Lausten: @MediumRareOG +1 It sucked in TBC and it still sucks today
[1:35:22] MediumRareOG: @Lausten MoP had it too with Motes of Harmony
[1:35:28] Valestrus: whats your ATT atm?
[1:35:49] Valestrus: wow xD
[1:35:56] MediumRareOG: I'm tempted to level another character because I have an odd number of level 70s now
[1:35:58] Valestrus: im at 61
[1:36:02] MachoCham: Can't wait for that to tank in TWW KEKW
[1:36:04] Lausten: @MediumRareOG Yeah its insane how they havent figured out its the exact same if they just scale it up..
[1:36:05] octom13: What is the most difficult Achievement you have left?
[1:36:35] Valestrus: I know - type nemsis
[1:36:37] BBMezzy: Select a random pvp achievement :p
[1:36:39] Valestrus: nemesis*
[1:36:44] MediumRareOG: @Lausten It almost made sense when stacking limits were lower. but with stacks of 1000 there's zero point in Awakeneed items
[1:36:45] octom13: Do you plan to do the PvP achievements?
[1:36:51] MachoCham: CE Amirdrassil properly
[1:36:55] MachoCham: Probably*
[1:37:14] Valestrus: pvp from WoD
[1:37:36] NeeK_23: mrgmHelloThere
[1:37:36] Valestrus: you need to kill 500 players of every race
[1:37:59] Lausten: @Valestrus IN DRAENOR
[1:38:19] Valestrus: @Lausten yep xD - you can do the Ashran BG

[1:38:50] Valestrus: hah
[1:38:51] Valestrus: a
[1:39:19] BBMezzy: The problem with pvp achievements is often your priorities have to go against the group's interests. They're so toxic to do
[1:39:27] Big_Rum: Dan right now you are at a 74.94% Now thats a C average. I'm gonna need to see more effort here.
[1:39:30] Lausten: @Valestrus Oh I know, Im still missing 2 races, there is not many Dwarves or Draeneis in Ashran BGs..
[1:39:37] NeeK_23: I put the warlords title on my "PVP aint gonna happen" list
[1:39:54] Valestrus: @Lausten im doing Dwarves atm
[1:39:55] beezelebaub: in the inn, I think
[1:39:59] NeeK_23: im the inn
[1:40:26] basutbud1: buy spices on ah
[1:40:41] MachoCham: Quick someone gouge the prices
[1:41:07] MachoCham: I expected that to be more expensive Madge
[1:41:36] MachoCham: Is it a recipie for token?
[1:41:38] MachoCham: On vendor
[1:41:59] NeeK_23: cooking awards are awful to farm out, not hard but limited per day
[1:42:42] Lausten: Look up mising recipes ;)
[1:42:48] NeeK_23: I have all cooking maxed except legion since I cant bring myself to go through it all again

[1:43:43] Grzmocillla: meh
[1:43:47] UlthraneDK: Hyped for old world Dragonriding
[1:43:57] BBMezzy: Gotta be honest, not really. Some one time story stuff and another world event grind
[1:44:11] MediumRareOG: I'm not excited for the 8 hour patch, things being laggy and not working and the 1 hour patch every day for the next 3 days
[1:44:37] UlthraneDK: NABetaTesters
[1:44:48] Sery_Bot: The ad break is finishing now! seryboLove
[1:45:03] JakeSezz: Guess Iâ€™m the only one stoked for it ðŸ˜‚ Just wanna use follower dungeons to try different specs and rotations cuz fuck looking at Icy Veins or Wowhead for all that meta shit
[1:45:54] Valestrus: which mount is this?
[1:45:56] NeeK_23: controversial opinion, but I dont mind story being time gated. The fact that I could in theory complete all Gilneas and Belameth story on day one means its feels less substantial and impactful. Its like binging a show rather than having the anticipation to wait a week for the next episode.
[1:46:17] MediumRareOG: Can they just let us mail cross realm already? this is so tedious
[1:46:32] JakeSezz: @neek_23 Agreed
[1:46:42] RAF_Sean: I'm hyped for follower dungeons and Azerothian Archives
[1:47:34] Lausten: @MediumRareOG I guess the issue is what happens if the realm you're trying to send mail to is offline, we are still living in this weird era of individual servers for wow..
[1:47:36] Valestrus: @MrGM  - do you think that eventually theyll just cross faction/realm everything: placing the game in a mega server of sorts?
[1:47:49] NeeK_23: I'm probably not the audience for follower dungeons, I dont see a reason I;d use them, but glad they now exist for others that will use them
[1:47:54] Implied_Slight: does the azerothian archives have pets or recipes? all I saw on the blizzard post were mounts and transmog iirc
[1:47:56] StreamElements: dracJAM TWITCH PRIME dracJAM
[1:48:29] Lausten: @Valestrus Its their plan, they are chipping away at it every patch it seems..
[1:48:29] MachoCham: @NeeK_23 I have a couple bits of xmog left
[1:49:01] BBMezzy: That's one of the faster profession achievements they added mrgmHehe
[1:49:25] tarnishedvalor: we used to use kungaloosh in bgs haha
[1:49:50] Valestrus: @Lausten good idea
[1:49:53] MediumRareOG: @NeeK_23 It's not just to tmog. It's a way to learn to play a class without getting yelled at or kicked
[1:50:56] Implied_Slight: it's also hopefully a step to them allowing follower dungeons in the next expansion if it does well @NeeK_23

[1:52:49] Lausten: Auctionator
[1:53:03] tarnishedvalor: haha!  and ty...I'll have to get that...that looks awesome
[1:53:30] Lausten: If you use the "Track Recipe" at upper right corner it can track several professions at once and find the materials
[1:53:48] Big_Rum: Hey you need another person with you in ICC to get the vampire achievent. Ill come with you if youwant
[1:54:55] dwolf010: cant wait for cross account gold tbh. so ofthen i need gold on a other realm but cant send it
[1:54:56] tarnishedvalor: it should--I've been clearing out old foods and potions from my banks and they've been mostly selling
[1:55:26] dwolf010: hope we get more hero talents previews today
[1:55:29] Big_Rum: I cant start the raid and youjoin and you can still get the achieve if you need
[1:55:36] Lausten: @dwolf010 If they make it default instead of having to turn gold into a bank like how guild banks work now..

[1:57:15] MediumRareOG: With the TWW tmog change I'm going to farm Vault of Archavon so hard
[1:57:17] UlthraneDK: The books cycle sometimes in the spots
[1:57:20] grotsnack: what achieve are we working on?
[1:57:29] Asheytv: They not always up, but i think you can phase swap
[1:57:31] Lausten: Remember using a channel to share if they spawned in Wrath.. There may be a discord for it these days lol
[1:57:31] darkshadowq_27: That achivement is insane, the books appear at random hours for like a couple of minutes
[1:57:33] Big_Rum: you have to come back every day to check
[1:57:55] grotsnack: The boks are not always there AND other books swapn in those locations as well
[1:58:00] grotsnack: lol books
[1:58:07] Lausten: Rememer Teleporting from mid raid and getting it! LUL
[1:58:22] darkshadowq_27: Omg!!
[1:58:26] JakeSezz: Wait til you have to grind for the fishing up specific coins from the Dal fountain. That shit took me so long and I STILL canâ€™t attempt the same cheev in Legion mrgmO
[1:59:07] Lausten: Just do it, its not that bad :D
[1:59:18] tarnishedvalor: oh i forgot about the coin one...i did while waiting for raids lol
[1:59:33] tarnishedvalor: just time consuming
[1:59:37] JakeSezz: But I also did that when Wrath was live content, so Iâ€™m not sure if they changed up percentages
[1:59:38] Kyocere: just takes a while
[1:59:45] JakeSezz: Itâ€™s not difficult just time consuming
[1:59:45] Lausten: Its not difficult, its just boring

[2:03:17] Harai_Ulfsark: classic timewalking when
[2:03:36] tarnishedvalor: great idea
[2:03:40] Lausten: @darkshadowq_27 We had 50% rep from Diablo 4 promotion
[2:04:07] MediumRareOG: I wish they would do classic TW. Add BFA and SL TW and you should have TW every week
[2:04:25] JakeSezz: mrgmHehe mrgmHehe
[2:04:36] Harai_Ulfsark: which raid for classic timewalking tho, molten core? BWL? old naxx for those sweet tears?

[2:06:41] tarnishedvalor: oh yeah if you toss the coins back in you get a lucky buff that can give you more coins. forgot that
[2:06:54] UlthraneDK: mrgmO
[2:07:00] JakeSezz: I was miserable and in my previous marriage, so of course fishing up those coins was more interesting than spending time with her mrgmO jakese1LUL mrgmHehe

[2:09:00] Lausten: Make a discord for it?
[2:09:17] grotsnack: Can't you make a publick section of  the discord?
[2:09:19] MachoCham: See you there next Saturday
[2:09:46] NeeK_23: I feel I should be in the discord so I can boss people around

[2:20:47] Sery_Bot: The ad break is finishing now! seryboLove
[2:21:42] JakeSezz: I only have 30/49 Wintergrasp stuff so I doubt Iâ€™ll get that up higher
[2:21:57] Goblocker: I havent questest in Northrend in a long time....might be time for a run
[2:22:16] JakeSezz: For real though! Tryna get Vyrosa & Time Lost sucks on my low pop realm
[2:22:18] Harai_Ulfsark: set up a second account in a RP realm, warmode and chromie time Kappa
[2:22:37] Goblocker: oh man I ran this place 3 times a day for weeks to get this mount
[2:22:38] Harai_Ulfsark: then you party sync your main
[2:22:42] MediumRareOG: @Goblocker the quest markers for northrend are horrible
[2:23:01] SlithTheSivak: can i ask what the venue is uve looked at?
[2:23:23] Goblocker: @MediumRareOG well something to look forward to then!
[2:23:31] NeeK_23: I do all my rare farming on a german RP realm with warmode on. I can get all the pandaria world bosses 100% of the time. Sha can live for 10mins before he's killed, thats how quiet it is
[2:23:54] MachoCham: I'm tempted to use my boost on one of those servers for that reason
[2:24:18] MachoCham: Trials can't get some mounts right?
[2:24:25] NeeK_23: its tough since I joined a guild for the short cooldown but I dont speak german so idk what the guild is saying LuL
[2:24:29] Lausten: die nachtwache or how you spell it? @NeeK_23
[2:24:38] MediumRareOG: Dead realms are crucial for collecting and completionism
[2:25:26] NeeK_23: Im on frostwolf. I also have one on a French realm but thats a bit more populated
[2:25:38] MediumRareOG: The low/medium/high thing can be a complete lie because of how connected realms work
[2:26:17] Lausten: He wanders, its a ghost Tuskarr
[2:26:27] NeeK_23: can you /tar it?
[2:26:43] MediumRareOG: I now have 10 level 70s on 1 dead realm. I'm probably half the population
[2:27:48] NeeK_23: if you arent aware /ping has a longer range than nameplates, so you can ping even if you cant see it yet
[2:28:49] JakeSezz: Dirkee is one of like 3 rares I need to kill in Northrend and that fucker isnâ€™t showing up for me lmao
[2:28:55] MediumRareOG: i've done basically none of these rare and treasure achievements
[2:29:26] Faerlynn: isn't Dirkee the one who shares spawn with time-lsot drake and one other rare?
[2:29:33] ReSeT_VT: dragonriding in 2 days? pog
[2:29:42] Lausten: Thats Vya something
[2:29:48] NeeK_23: I was doing the glory of amirdrassil last night and you need to find whelps in the tree on tindral, but they're too far to put markers on, but a ping macro will show them up. very helpful
[2:29:50] ReSeT_VT: vyragosa I think share with tlpd
[2:29:51] JakeSezz: Nah itâ€™s Vyrosa & Time Lost
[2:29:58] Stormcrone: I thought he shared with Vryagosa
[2:30:06] MediumRareOG: @ReSeT_VT correct
[2:30:17] timex1: Do we know if follower dungeons will be a path to level from 60-70, instead of questing?
[2:30:34] timex1: damn ok
[2:30:42] ReSeT_VT: @timex1 there's a limit of 10/day so probably not a viable strategy
[2:30:46] MediumRareOG: Vyragosa is rare (2-8 hours). 10% of the time it'll be TLPD instead
[2:31:06] NeeK_23: no mount

[2:31:32] NeeK_23: if it does, create group and relog to join the group
[2:31:33] ReSeT_VT: what does trial even work with, mount-wise? voidtalon?
[2:31:41] UlthraneDK: Did they limit the Follow Dungeons out of fear of some sort of potential farming exploit?
[2:31:56] physalis4: you can get mounts on trial characters. I donâ€™t think you can on trial accts
[2:31:56] NeeK_23: of get one of chat to join group
[2:32:26] Lidlberg: Frightened Kodo Works with Trial
[2:32:51] NeeK_23: class trials cant get mounts like WoD mounts that I know
[2:33:01] MediumRareOG: IIRC any mounts you have to loot don't work with trials
[2:34:04] MediumRareOG: @physalis4 Some mounts you cannot get on trial characters eg the WoD rare open world mounts
[2:34:05] alicemch: its until a certain level
[2:34:12] alicemch: i cant remember what level tho
[2:34:13] MediumRareOG: 3 hours playtime on trial characters
[2:34:39] alicemch: oooh mb :P
[2:34:45] alicemch: i dropped out for a bit hahaha
[2:34:49] MediumRareOG: it's either 3 hours or when you do enough of a storyline. Nobody hits that though. It's just 3 hours
[2:35:49] JakeSezz: Dirkee has multiple locations. if you have RareScanner, click the creature face and colored dots show everywhere the rare can be/spawn
[2:36:32] invictus_DK: I killed him with Cata Chromie time and Warmode on
[2:36:33] Stormcrone: Zygor will give you a path to all locations
[2:37:08] invictus_DK: Cromie time makes things a bit easier esp when its late in the time

[2:59:42] Lausten: @Big_Rum Drop items from Islands
[2:59:55] Iwony: is it just me or is the music too loud?

[3:00:43] NeeK_23: the secret pet was only added in early DF
[3:00:51] JustAnotherCJ: I lowkey love farming islands as aff lock. perma corruption makes it mindlessly simple

[3:01:56] Elrathir: Elrathir subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 32 months! hello is this the right stream to see a streamer kill level 70 crabs in Northrend?
[3:01:57] JustAnotherCJ: I could be remembering wrong
[3:02:00] Chesscape: for heroic you need 10
[3:02:12] chelfx: Looking back i think we were too harsh on warfronts
[3:02:14] Harai_Ulfsark: follower warfronts monkaHmm

[3:14:22] Harai_Ulfsark: yeah the kaliri
[3:14:23] Lausten: Ikky is indeed a bird pet
[3:14:24] NeeK_23: honestly its only good at 25, if youre using level 1 pets its not that great
[3:14:29] Iwony: ikky is quest but there are other birds like him 2

[3:15:28] CrowMomocle: Ikky from Spires?
[3:15:45] NeeK_23: pet battles is the true endgame of wow, mythic raiding has higher participation than pvp pet battles
[3:15:52] ZellieMoogle: Aw, no love for Pepe or pet battles, we are quite different humans LUL Loving the chill stream though thefor74HEARTS
[3:16:05] Eleophantes: Wow grats

[3:16:12] the_rethan_family: I'm so excited to be sitting at work while US-Players will be experiencing all the encripted story first-hand.
[3:17:08] MediumRareOG: Not available isn't included in the ATT percentage by default
[3:17:08] Lausten: Not IACM settings though @Eleophantes
[3:17:10] octom13: I've always thought the PvP achievements were quite daunting.
[3:17:14] octom13: o
[3:17:39] death_cam_: you can get a few "no longer available" or "Never available to players" tmog from quantum items in dawn atleast :D

[3:17:56] StreamElements: dracJAM TWITCH PRIME dracJAM
[3:17:57] Dantares24: once we can collect all armor types on one character in dungeons/raids in TWW then it should be a lot easier to get that overall dungeon % up
[3:17:58] Iwony: I won't be online tomorrow to not be spoiled...
[3:17:59] MediumRareOG: Getting 100% involves clearing 100% Mythic raids, grinding M+, geting PvP gladiator, farming arenas and RBGs, doing open world and collecting legacy. It's somewhat unrealistic
[3:18:20] Rokir_: PartyParrot Lunch Break Jams PartyParrot
[3:18:34] Rokir_: Dude if you go through with this event I will talk the wife into it
[3:19:12] thunduz: good morning everyone!

[3:19:56] thunduz: am I? thatâ€™s legit! letâ€™s goooooo
[3:20:40] chelfx: Gilneas RP was atleast pretty big
[3:20:43] ZellieMoogle: oo Wow event, that reminds me, if its okay to ask here - is your business email listed on Twitch the best place to contact you about a venue for your south UK creator meetup plans? Its not convention sized but I have a place in mind that has potential :)
[3:20:50] Rokir_: Can't wait to cash in my 87th Horse Mount
[3:21:05] the_rethan_family: How long until we get a reveal for patch 10.2.6. They went great lenghts to exclude it from the 2024 roadmap, so they must be pretty confident in its content.
[3:21:12] derzorn04: all I want from TWW is a DK rework. Nothing else - I just want it to be fun to play current and legacy content
[3:21:25] Rokir_: @derzorn04 Don't wish that upon us.... DK is amazing to play rn all 3 specs
[3:21:35] Rokir_: As an Unholy Player nah, they just need some buffs, still very fun to play
[3:22:05] death_cam_: i miss mop unholy tbh
[3:22:12] ZellieMoogle: Awesome thank you, will write up a message today <3
[3:22:35] derzorn04: mobile D&D, actual blood mitigation and UH is so bloated
[3:22:42] thunduz: oh my, it didnâ€™t even click to me patch day is tomorrow!
[3:22:54] chelfx: Thye did show off scarlet in the video
[3:23:09] KettelChips: Do reps become account bound with this patch or is that not until War Within
[3:23:20] the_rethan_family: I wonder how they will keep Quel'thalas under wraps during Midnight when it will be part of the eastern-kingdom map.
[3:23:21] Polcofon: @MrGM Any info about a token based catch up gear in 10.2.5? So tired of farming lfr for catalyst materials :(
[3:23:43] KettelChips: Ahh ok
[3:23:51] KettelChips: Im still grinding Valdrakken renown for my hunter

[3:26:21] Lausten: Someone asked about business email 2 min ago
[3:27:37] ZellieMoogle: Collection content is life, much easier to complete a raid than to 100% collecting right LUL
[3:28:09] MachoCham: Genuinely not sure, I hope the latter but
[3:28:33] Lausten: Everybody everybody everybody..
[3:28:34] KettelChips: I had 500+ Illidan kills until I got both glaives
[3:28:40] KettelChips: had 14 Off hands before the main hand
[3:28:44] NeeK_23: I kinda dont want to 100% because then I'll have nothing to do. I like knowing theres more to be done
[3:29:18] Lausten: @NeeK_23 Thats only a problem for you to think about if you're top 10 DFA LUL
[3:29:37] Lheela: Did my last 5 items from the OG violet hold yesterday, that dungeon is not fun to farm
[3:29:39] KettelChips: Which I think the Off Hand is a lower drop. I was going insane
[3:29:48] NeeK_23: 500???? wow, I was lucky, I got mine 4 weeks apart
[3:29:59] KettelChips: T_T
[3:30:02] Uchiha_Cloaky: Yooo
[3:30:06] KettelChips: Lol I made so many DHs just to farm it
[3:30:24] Uchiha_Cloaky: Always hard to spell the name Sadge
[3:30:26] Uchiha_Cloaky: Haha
[3:30:38] KettelChips: I dont even main DH anymore. Im so sad
[3:30:42] KettelChips: But yeah when I do play it
[3:30:51] UlthraneDK: Oh noooooo
[3:30:54] KettelChips: I had to do it on principal
[3:31:01] ZellieMoogle: Time to lurk, the household (and my own stomach) needs feeding! Good luck with the collecting <3

[3:53:41] MachoCham: Thank you for not using the F word
[3:53:42] MachoCham: <3
[3:53:55] Oswaldovzki: Is wrestling a permance?
[3:54:12] Lheela: Not meant to be rude, genuinely wondering if it's actually competitive
[3:54:19] Lausten: What? Its not a bar brawl on a stage? Its staged? :O
[3:54:33] Mystic_Bard: the audience doesn't know who is gonna win
[3:54:52] BritishRaven: But you could ask anybody who watches Emmerdale if they think it's real and they wouldn't know what to say
[3:54:56] Oswaldovzki: Honestly, wrestling is waaaay better and more entertaining than "real"  fighting
[3:54:57] thunduz: what?! next youâ€™ll tell me the MCU is all staged
[3:55:20] MachoCham: I find UFC and Boxing boring. I prefer my fighting worked
[3:55:31] Lheela: It's like a fireworks show, everyone knows roughly whats going to happen, everything pre planned, still a fun spectacle to watch
[3:55:48] thunduz: yeah they get boring after a while
[3:56:11] thunduz: lots of dodging. itâ€™s almost like they donâ€™t want to be hit in the face
[3:56:59] BritishRaven: MJF is really good with a mic.
[3:57:15] MachoCham: MJF is a generational talent, underrated in the ring
[3:59:16] MachoCham: It's why Conor McGregor did well "mainstream" as he was just treating it as wrestling 101 with promos etc

[4:17:40] KettelChips: I hate when people project stuff like that
[4:17:56] StreamElements: dracJAM TWITCH PRIME dracJAM
[4:17:56] KettelChips: I just got married on New Years Eve so now everyone is saying stuff like that to me lol
[4:18:23] MediumRareOG: the bigest problem is the 2nd will be on a completely different schedule. napping when the other isn't, etc

[4:18:43] cautionreptiles: Were not having kids
[4:18:46] lyreilla: You excited to be an uncle?
[4:19:03] CpnRad: good evening hope you and yours are doing well
[4:19:32] TruVillainManny: I hear what you are saying, Mr.GM. I never project and I dislike everyone trying to push their stubborn lack of self reflection on me.
[4:19:41] lyreilla: Out of the 4 of us siblings, only my sister and me and had kids, our kids were mighty spoiled.
[4:19:42] BananaBaby29: being a uncle is so much fun you get all the rewards and get to hand them back at the end of the day
[4:20:20] MachoCham: Are you the first out of you three to have kids?
[4:20:54] lyreilla: The first ones always a hold a little more precious spot. I mean I love them all, but my bond with my niece way stronger than with my nephew.
[4:21:15] TruVillainManny: Crossing my fingers for your younger brother there.
[4:21:31] lyreilla: And the first of us grandkids always got better treatment from the grandma's. LOL
[4:22:24] CpnRad: makes it sound so simple
[4:22:48] MachoCham: Yeah there is the spawn point
[4:22:51] Mordotzz: u might be able to get it via ppl in the secret finderes discord
[4:23:00] CpnRad: people on my server are selling TLPD drops and I have no idea how that could work
[4:23:01] Mordotzz: there's like 4-5 spawn points
[4:23:05] SlyD4G: Just sit at the spawn for a few days and you'll get it. :)
[4:23:22] MediumRareOG: It only took me a week to get the TLPD. it's not hard. YOu need to AFK in zone. use trial accounts
[4:23:28] Mordotzz: yea u need to have it open constantly when u look for grp and have a char ready
[4:23:32] Mordotzz: of each faction
[4:23:40] MachoCham: Can you loot the TLPD on a trial?
[4:23:54] cautionreptiles: youll get it in 3 kills im sure lol
[4:24:03] KettelChips: any reason you are on a trial?
[4:24:09] MachoCham: "Class trials cannot loot Time-Lost Proto-Drake for Reins of the Time-Lost Proto-Drake."
[4:24:10] Pyromobs: hello
[4:24:16] MediumRareOG: The trial is for the notifications. I said trial account not trial character. You log in once it spawns
[4:24:17] BananaBaby29: so is it war within where you get dynamic flying on other mounts thand dragons?
[4:24:22] Mordotzz: they changed it some years ago so u cants use trials
[4:24:46] Pyromobs: i did get invisible mount from the box from the ulduar quest box @MrGM
[4:24:48] Mordotzz: when loot on trials i meant
[4:25:13] Mordotzz: oh yea i should do the tw raid
[4:25:16] MediumRareOG: Yes, just park the toon there. Same realm as your toon. You'll need to sit in zone for 2+ hours to get Vyragosa or TLPD to spawn
[4:25:18] Pyromobs: im not a mount farmer :p

[4:27:32] chelfx: Thoughts on follower dng limit
[4:28:10] chefdejour82: probaly for bots
[4:28:18] Mordotzz: it might be super slow to run those dungeons tbf
[4:28:26] MachoCham: Quick go offline, we'll get news then
[4:28:44] MachoCham: You say that, but if it takes say for instance 1000 people out of the dungeon queues
[4:28:48] MachoCham: Then it's 1000 Dungeons
[4:28:52] MachoCham: Not 200
[4:28:52] capncolbeer: if follower dungeons have an AI component, that could be the initial limitation
