[1:05:50] TimTimmyMcTim: i think they would need to allow people to just create a full character and join pvp... takes too long to get a character rdy to play pvp
[1:05:58] goombacci: I am just looking at healer mana idk whats going on
[1:05:58] knersh_: he sounds like roger
[1:06:00] wintexx: guzz is guzzling damage YEP

[1:06:20] lathander557: Casters are there for hype among other stuff, it's aight
[1:06:23] Empirics_: Its kinda their job to hype things up
[1:06:27] wintexx: color analyst
[1:06:29] brodiebrohan: that’s true she is white

[1:07:34] semifive: Eiya has done some color before and she wasn't terrible.
[1:07:36] Nox1o: the way you phrased that might doxx you
[1:07:50] Standy94: She had to cast some when people were out
[1:07:58] ThisIzD: dunno if she will do this season. people give her a lot of shit but she does pretty good honestly.
[1:08:37] pnguinwow: she does a pretty good job with rwf when shes on as well
[1:08:45] lathander557: As a PVE Andy this is turbo hard to follow
[1:08:47] duckdaring: I hope the people who give her shit get the help they need.

[1:09:56] HeffaBear: firstGarf
[1:09:57] Deadlynedly: you dont look a day over 45
[1:10:02] JansonLives: everything after 30 is basically the same. just old AF
[1:10:02] surpriseparty20: Monk is unlikable
[1:10:04] MaliciousDH: @Dippy_Mcshit sup man
[1:10:05] Standy94: @maximum do you get excited when your grandkids visit?
[1:10:07] wintexx: respect u age well
[1:10:12] iilu: You can sneeze and 7 years goes past
[1:10:16] Brohdin: What was the bit that didn't hit?
[1:10:18] daiger5o: So arena is basically who can survive untill healer goes oom?
[1:10:18] sgtshellshocka: im 31, no shot you are 30. you look old as fuck
[1:10:32] minikori: it's sad when the best players age out of the game but i'm sure you've got 3 or 4 solid months left
[1:10:33] Madgeneto: @sgtshellshocka AINTNOWAY
[1:10:42] RamblingJosh_: dang I guess I turn 36 this year, december birthdays trippy
[1:10:44] Seventhedeadly: I'd love to see Trill on the WW again...
[1:10:56] duckdaring: He's 30, but his beard is 48.
[1:11:08] Nox1o: @RamblingJosh_ gg, enjoy the last few yours you got
[1:11:12] goombacci: hoolibang LETSGO
[1:11:16] wintexx: yea i guess its because my beard game is max as a 13 year old
[1:11:31] hunt0313: yea that happens alot
[1:11:31] GoldieGmoney: tranq gives full immunity unlessed ring of peaced
[1:11:36] elysona: its even less reliable
[1:11:41] Nox1o: it sucked in SL, no idea now
[1:11:41] FentanXD: Less
[1:11:43] ghost97tt: much less
[1:11:44] SpeedyMcD: its more useful in pvp
[1:11:44] Standy94: Max doesn’t look a day over 45
[1:11:48] ponchuus: It is not reliable
[1:11:51] Nox1o: back then sometimes it feelt like 3sec until I could use
[1:11:51] Cakerinotv: its def better now after they changed it, but its still a bit janky
[1:11:56] warlorlorlock: woot
[1:11:57] ssj_lenin: damn they even got charts going
[1:11:59] Madgeneto: @minikori nah he's good at least until 40, wow is already considered a turn based game by other game players and his position is not one where he needs a 16yo reaction time
[1:12:07] mikkirogue: mikkirogue subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 14 months! 
[1:12:11] Bloosah: rupture ticks for 18k' Oo
[1:12:38] NeckBeardAlpha: back to what you said about ziqo shout casting, yea is A goat, and a good streamer, i dont like him, but that aside this does not mean he is a good commentating caster
[1:12:39] surpriseparty20: Quick mafs
[1:12:43] minikori: @Madgeneto is my one guy attempt getting one guyed
[1:12:43] pseudo75: HUH
[1:12:44] ssj_lenin: need an entire second monitor with nothing but STATS
[1:12:45] Dzor12: HUH
[1:12:46] mstr_shake: guzzle
[1:12:47] goombacci: uuh
[1:12:48] boostedh_: HUH
[1:12:50] jamesbangs69: HUH
[1:12:50] Firesinger: Amen, brother!
[1:12:51] ArcaneSyntax: SUCK some CHI POTLES
[1:12:53] pnguinwow: HUH
[1:12:55] Onyo1337: HUH
[1:13:01] Ralykx: What did you order? You a burrito bowl guy?
[1:13:02] goombacci: you mean the two orders?
[1:13:03] Madgeneto: @Madgeneto one guy ception
[1:13:09] Keyroz_wow: cheap shotly
[1:13:17] Goodstuffe: im sure this is hype asf for those who know wtf going on
[1:13:22] buffkenobi: @Maximum bro did you see michael buble high on shrooms at the nhl all star game lmao
[1:13:40] kniftty: Narratives matter
[1:13:40] Ignite_CLO: true and real
[1:13:42] nezz231: pretty cool that two new teams get to final first time
[1:13:44] clickermekk: i agree and disagree at the same time
[1:13:44] Goats48: Dont feel that way at all
[1:13:50] goombacci: you want the underdog matches
[1:13:52] kelly_mac06: yea it's weird, you like seeing new ppl but then you have no idea who the fuck they are
[1:13:55] goombacci: bro I hate when they call me
[1:13:59] ArcaneSyntax: @Maximum like we aren't invested in seeing them lose
[1:14:04] ScarTay: Max watching pvp?!? PVP stonks have just gone up!!!
[1:14:04] trenbolon408: a team needs to win a couple of times then people will talk about them and get invested
[1:14:07] goombacci: I literally put every option for them to leave it at the door
[1:14:08] Standy94: NA has more well known PvP players
[1:14:10] Madgeneto: ALOO
[1:14:11] Dzor12: Well, the only way to learn who they are is for them to win and learn about them
[1:14:15] semifive: It helps though that an exciting spec is in the match.  Seeing WW and Arms makes it more interesting.
[1:14:15] happyfunrockk: "Don't ever call me just leave it at the door" - Max 2024.
[1:14:17] Krovektv: Pulling your headset off and yanking your glasses with them is insanely relatable
[1:14:18] boostedh_: always leave at door Smadge
[1:14:23] lathander557: No contact delivery always, what is it 2010?
[1:14:27] Keyroz_wow: the guy is like HUH made you walk out
[1:14:29] SirPikajew: Imagine doordash driver is letting him know someone is yet again crawling out of a window
[1:14:30] Madgeneto: @Standy94 if you're NA i guess
[1:14:32] decay8: :b
[1:14:32] Keyroz_wow: HAH*
[1:14:36] RocketTanks: I hate that. I had someone knock for like 5 minutes the other day when it clearly says do not knock do not ring doorbell leave at door.
[1:14:36] TheItalianStallion321: @happyfunrockk hey that rhymes
[1:14:37] duckdaring: At least they're at the right door.
[1:14:50] RenzikOz: that’s a good thing new people get exposure,
[1:15:13] lathander557: "I became a dasher for the interpersonal interaction"
[1:15:24] goombacci: @lathander557 actually what it seems like
[1:15:24] yashka123123: hi
[1:15:25] semifive: When you live in apartments you wish they would knock and not just leave it; or you might not get it
[1:15:26] stljay73: I think it hits this final more because both teams are new
[1:15:31] Camelbak21: I'm falling asleep watching this MonkaS
[1:15:35] Onyo1337: firstGarf
[1:15:37] Madgeneto: ele mastery procs go brrr
[1:15:40] sim967: I know next to nothing about pvp and will still watch awc
[1:15:47] ArcaneSyntax: These matches would be more interesting if there was a ret paladin in them.
[1:16:00] m1lkman10: Did you tell your food delivery guy to look up?
[1:16:11] duckdaring: lol
[1:16:25] Nox1o: did you get a new one or the old design? New ones have a huge bump on the bottom so there is less in it
[1:16:31] infraxtion: they never read those
[1:16:33] Keyroz_wow: the guy definitely got you
[1:16:34] fredwar: when does timetrials end?
[1:16:35] rukt: rukt subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 8 months! ruktBuranyuu
[1:16:36] roguerhino: seriously why do they have a burning need to call you? its so annoying
[1:16:36] goombacci: yeah
[1:16:37] colt149: woah you don't wanna chill with the homies?
[1:16:42] daiger5o: Maybe he was a fan
[1:16:44] TheItalianStallion321: @Maximum i want the drivers to call or ring my doorbell when food arrives
[1:16:44] CoffeeASAP: ALOO I'm at your door
[1:16:45] QuokkaEnjoyer: He's a fan dude Sadge
[1:16:45] MooKalti: yeah I hate that, they never read the option
[1:16:45] minikori: max you ever had them leave the food on the sidewalk in front of your house? that one happens to me sometimes
[1:16:46] hemperorpalpatine: too much human interaction for ya
[1:16:46] Dippy_Mcshit: I have "DONT RING OR KNOCK ON THE DOOR, JUST GO"
[1:16:49] m1lkman10: He obviosuly got you
[1:16:51] duckdaring: I say to leave it at the door, then put 'leave it at the door' in the comment. Triggers them to ring the doorbell over and over.
[1:16:51] Keyroz_wow: made you walk out
[1:16:52] daiger5o: Maybe hes in chat
[1:16:53] TheItalianStallion321: i dont want that shit outside to possibly stolen
[1:16:56] itsfyf: food's here HAH
[1:17:09] Firesinger: I hate it when that happens. When DoorDash first debuted the "leave at my door" feature at the start of the pandemic, half of my drivers completely ignored it and knocked on the door 'til I came. lol
[1:17:12] Doomtree71: is NA right after this?
[1:17:15] lathander557: Now next season it'll be "oh shit, these are the guys that knocked out echo last time, let's go"
[1:17:23] Esotraz: i just wish there was competition
[1:17:23] clickermekk: not true everyone loves a cinderella story regardless of big names
[1:17:24] Nox1o: mdi has 3 teams
[1:17:24] NerdRagedOut: maximumHands maximumHands maximumHands
[1:17:26] goombacci: aka underdog story
[1:17:33] ArcaneSyntax: @Maximum there's also just less investment because people really wanna see the dominant team lose
[1:17:34] semifive: Like a movie with no established stars; you just don't know if the movie will be good
[1:17:34] Indurop951: imagine RWF with like 8 teams
[1:17:34] Standy94: NA has 3 at least
[1:17:38] mstr_shake: NA has that rn
[1:17:38] Zephn: damn they got hoolibanged
[1:17:40] Ignite_CLO: its like having to watch brock purdy in the superbowl
[1:17:54] Esotraz: wrong
[1:17:57] TeamLiquid: Looking to take your gameplay to the next level? Learning a new class and would like some pointers? Head on over to our discord go.adv.gg/6tAoHx to schedule a coaching session with your favorite Team Liquid raider!
[1:17:59] Standy94: copium
[1:17:59] Paxa_G: Doubt
[1:18:00] goombacci: liquid will crush them mercilessly o7
[1:18:01] Nox1o: didnt they lose to Echo at blizzcon? KEKW
[1:18:07] SriveMyDoul: then 0-3 curse will return
[1:18:08] kadashy1: Cope
[1:18:09] surpriseparty20: The unstoppable force the immovable object
[1:18:09] Addison___: Looking
[1:18:10] mstr_shake: True but, Pika's team is always in the mix.
[1:18:10] supercalifragstalistic: Is luminosity not competing anymore?
[1:18:12] novembersdoom: NA doesn't have 3 anymore. 2 at best. Liquid is by far the best.
[1:18:13] anmusallam: o7 o7 o7
[1:18:17] duckdaring: I'm watching for Taylor Swift.
[1:18:19] forshard: youve seen cdews new haircut?
[1:18:19] Gamerhcp: a car
[1:18:21] TheItalianStallion321: bro, fuckin buy me a house
[1:18:21] CoffeeASAP: free Honda
[1:18:25] Nox1o: a vision pro
[1:18:27] SirPikajew: I feel like a franchise is more than a house?
[1:18:28] mclaawn: ??
[1:18:29] knersh_: that's more
[1:18:30] fronkacean: feel like thats a house
[1:18:30] Mazmerized: thats kinda hecked up ngl

[1:18:35] ThisIzD: HUH
[1:18:36] MooKalti: he aint managing a micky d's with that haircut
[1:18:36] Firesinger: That sounds exactly like gifting someone a bird. KEKW
[1:18:36] Madgeneto: Susge what
[1:18:37] Deatheran: its like buying someone a parot yea
[1:18:38] NeckBeardAlpha: i get food from doordash often and some times they call when i say leave it and i asked why they said sometimes it makes them call depending on the resturants and how they do it
[1:18:39] Krappyboi: KEKW
[1:18:39] Qkombur: Way worse you can throw the bird away
[1:18:39] BobPlaysTheGames: Never gift a pet
[1:18:40] neojofa: me too @duckdaring
[1:18:40] shunsha: melee cleaves reign supreme! lol
[1:18:41] Esotraz: if chuck wins buy him a dog @Maximum
[1:18:41] thoromyr19: lol max i love your adhd brain
[1:18:42] Powzoar: Yeah
[1:18:42] throwmasterlol: buying someone a parrot fucking owns. that and turtle
[1:18:44] Powzoar: or a turtle
[1:18:44] infraxtion: free pet is the biggest con ever
[1:18:45] CoffeeASAP: lol
[1:18:45] redsmith12: that is way more than a house
[1:18:46] surpriseparty20: More like a handicapped bird
[1:18:46] Nox1o: you giving him a job at mcdonalds
[1:18:47] Nonnar: why would you ever give someone a pet?
[1:18:47] anmusallam: echo lost???
[1:18:53] Seventhedeadly: Blizcon wasn't even like real pvp... the comps there were crap.. everyone saw that
[1:18:53] knersh_: no XD
[1:18:54] TheItalianStallion321: parrots can last 70+ years
[1:18:55] Doomtree71: The bird won't make you money
[1:18:56] Bloosah: getting a MCdonalds frenchies is a fucking punishment
[1:18:58] m1lkman10: That's a great prank
[1:18:59] Paxa_G: Pets dont make you money
[1:19:00] NeckBeardAlpha: also i will take a mcdonalds franchise over a house anyday, the one by me went for 40 million
[1:19:00] TheItalianStallion321: you're not doing them favors
[1:19:00] guynormally: maximumBeakless no birds
[1:19:01] QuokkaEnjoyer: Its like forcing someone to adopt your child
[1:19:02] conchelobe: Except the franchise will make Hou alot of money
[1:19:02] Mazmerized: Should give it if they lose tbh
[1:19:02] Madgeneto: they can just sell it
[1:19:06] Seventhedeadly: computers* not like their comps
[1:19:08] knersh_: just selöl it XD
[1:19:09] semifive: Nah, giving a franchise isn't the same; you can find a middle manager for you

[1:31:02] Esotraz: 4-3 REVERSE SWEEP LETSGOOO
[1:31:04] Esotraz: yes
[1:31:09] Madgeneto: @surpriseparty20 it feels like playing with sanguine and the fact that someone chose to that to others and to themselves just makes it unforgivable
[1:31:09] MePachew: they alternate
[1:31:13] GoldieGmoney: correct loser picks map
[1:31:14] semifive: Loser picks map
[1:31:18] Esotraz: loser picks map > winner blind picks comp > loser counter comps
[1:31:21] nykkou55: loser gets to counter comps
[1:31:24] Ladrash: loser picks map, winner locks, then loser locks
[1:31:24] Esotraz: @Maximum
[1:31:25] stljay73: losser map, winner first comp
[1:31:26] Shimorta: loser picks map is smash style
[1:31:29] shea4it: bro wow pvp is a headache
[1:31:30] dBison24: loser picks map, winner picks comp first
[1:31:30] semifive: Winner has to lock in choice
[1:31:41] Dasptic: for more parody
[1:31:42] MePachew: fucking loser dorks
[1:31:42] Drase0117: so they are not losers anymore
[1:31:49] Madgeneto: to even it out
[1:31:49] Dasptic: more entertainment when its close series
[1:31:50] prismo5: stretch it out for more content
[1:31:51] sim967: to try to extend matches
[1:31:53] forshard: because it usually isnt down to that, it also makes the first match (and swing matches) way more important
[1:31:55] knersh_: doens't matter 3-0
[1:32:06] semifive: It is very rare that comps switch up though
[1:32:09] goombacci: @knersh_ 3-1
[1:32:12] Sinergy_57: map should be full random EZ
[1:32:22] hdott52: have you check into the MDI time trials?
[1:32:26] TheGymSock: maps should be random
[1:32:27] RamblingJosh_: If you win map 1 you have counterpick advantage still
[1:32:28] Esotraz: if u win blind pick u onlylhave to win ur own map picks with countercomp @Maximum
[1:32:31] Ok_Kingston: it should just alternate always
[1:32:34] xhepta: right but it's BoX so winning the first map is still really rewarded
[1:32:35] komqot: D:
[1:32:38] Ladrash: well winning first map means u counterpick last game no matter what if you go 1-1
[1:32:38] UbiNax: WutFace WutFace
[1:32:43] semifive: The strong teams would be too dominant
[1:32:44] kadashy1: i think being able to counter pick comp is a bit much
[1:32:45] Shimorta: well, if you win the first map, you're at an advantage for the full series since it's odd # of games. if loser always wins next map, the first game winner will always win
[1:32:49] roguerhino: that actually pretty standard in fighting esports tbh
[1:32:52] Madgeneto: why would you need an advantage when you already showed superiority? doesnt make sense as well. it's just a choice
[1:33:02] showerbees: wouldn’t it mean that they get an advantage on the match point?
[1:33:09] duckdaring: Map should be open world Barrens
[1:33:11] semifive: People like seeing underdogs have a chance
[1:33:14] goombacci: I mean you could argue otherwise whoever has first pick is like 60% to win
[1:33:16] SporadicZero: That's a pretty common aspect of fighting games. I guess it's to try to close the skill gap between players a bit.
[1:33:19] almostdps: 16 min barrier almost broken in mdi time trials
[1:33:21] Dasptic: would you say this about basketball/football where when u get scored on u get the ball
[1:33:26] donflamingofps: a threshhold @Maximum
[1:33:30] triviaEC: smash lets the loser pick the stage, right?
[1:33:47] LACHLES: checkmate format
[1:33:49] Dythan__: match point winner (50 point threshold)
[1:33:52] roguerhino: @almostdps omg echo just hit that 16:03 Pog
[1:33:53] Shimorta: @triviaEC yeah, arena comp is exactly how smash does counterpicks of stages and characters
[1:34:09] almostdps: @roguerhino yea no healer as well
[1:34:17] emkatalks: TFT had the same format for the Vegas lan and it was so sick to watch
[1:34:19] Madgeneto: if you already won it's expected that you win again. if the loser gets the advantage makes it less predictable, therefore more enjoyable to watch
[1:34:25] goombacci: people who want drops
[1:34:30] father_tito: But look, theyve had this format for a minute, and echo has won literally every tourney since like legion KEKW. so i mean it kinda nulls it. theyve hardly dropped games in the last couple seasons.
[1:34:33] Codester_remix: Apex is actually pretty interesting to watch ngl
[1:34:38] roguerhino: @roguerhino yea dude insane
[1:34:40] pnguinwow: apex is kinda fun to watch at the end of games tbh
[1:34:40] Nox1o: i enjoyed early pubg tournaments, probably just pubg hype though
[1:34:53] Yimbus737: if winner gets advantage they just steamroll by picking their own maps right
[1:34:55] SporadicZero: Well, you definitely wouldn't want the opposite way. If you allow the winning to gain more of an advantage, it could be viewed as a coin toss. Whoever wins the first game, wins the series.
[1:34:56] Esotraz: if u win blind pick u onlyl have to win ur own map picks with countercomp so in the sense of the series ur ahead  @Maximum
[1:34:56] goombacci: he still had meta. not scary
[1:35:00] HeffaBear: full melee comps look like 8 year olds playing soccer
[1:35:01] logicaltty: o7
[1:35:04] hivplus__: GG Pog
[1:35:07] guynormally: watching charlie and his gang watch team moist in apex is a blast
[1:35:08] Maximum: @Madgeneto ya more enjoyable to watch bad for competitve integrity
[1:35:09] Madgeneto: @HeffaBear lmao
[1:35:10] zachl_: fortnite at the last like 2 storms of the map and theres just 60 people alive and in their own box
[1:35:13] Bloosah: there we go, gg ez kill that fucking DH
[1:35:16] wystwaa: Blur and meta on cd
[1:35:18] Shimorta: @Maximum why is Zaelia playing Feral instead of Boomkin in their 4 dps comps? Boomkin claps hard doesn't it?
[1:35:21] MePachew: @goombacci well that aged like milk
[1:35:28] anmusallam: enjoyment >>>>

[1:35:45] semifive: Max do you root for the specs you play when you don't know the players
[1:35:47] Yimbus737: @Shimorta feral has instant regrowths, maybe because of that?
[1:35:50] MePachew: @Thruthh xD they had a meta prob TBF
[1:35:50] LuiBMHunter: waaait - echo didn't win something! *faint*

[1:45:48] prismo5: historically weird but recently fairly standard
[1:45:50] qufad: boomer comps
[1:45:54] kreyzy8: boomy/rogue has been very good in DF specifically but not much before
[1:45:55] supercalifragstalistic: Dont think beastcleve have been a thing since Mop thou xD

[1:46:46] TheEyeVII: @bloodbane1738 ok lemme be more precise, pve takes skill but there's a lower "celing skill cap" in pve, in pvp since you're playing vs players it's much much higher imo

[1:48:01] lawctor: THE MOVE
[1:48:01] TheEyeVII: @bloodbane1738 I still think relatively to pvp, pve takes no real skill even if you call it "different" or not
[1:48:04] ThisIzD: @burne114 nah its fake news
[1:48:05] gambleragain: EU with New faces in PVP. This is huge.

[1:49:20] guynormally: they looked way better against echo
[1:49:21] Tetiwow: melee cleave
[1:49:21] starcraft_t_v: i have only played rogue in pve sofar, what so you think is the best way to learn pvp from scratch?

[1:49:42] bloodbane1738: @TheEyeVII so in saying this ur saying all the pvp players have all the skill.. then lets have all the pvp players compete for RWF and see all that skill work its magic
[1:49:47] jostecaptain: Viewer rbgs when?
[1:49:50] Dasptic: slurs and all
[1:49:53] happyfunrockk: RBG community by far the most toxic.
[1:49:56] goombacci: rbgs instead of flyinf around season 4 guaranteed
[1:49:56] surpriseparty20: RBGs are chill content
[1:49:58] Standy94: RBG players are the lowest form of existence
[1:50:03] littlegooaatt: rbs
[1:50:08] Madgeneto: my BEST time in wow
[1:50:10] dulgr_1: @Maximum could be a cool series grinding to 2.1k rating
[1:50:10] MangoAndKiwi: true
[1:50:13] SriveMyDoul: the abn bracket monkaS
[1:50:15] TheEyeVII: @Maximum why no pvp btw? don't be a coward :)
[1:50:18] mrbonoso: RBG must be so fun as a raid leader to optimise a constantly changing fight?
[1:50:20] bloodstuck2000: This still EU?
[1:50:37] knersh_: BGs at the start of a expac is awesome but not later
[1:50:38] Powzoar: league?
[1:50:43] surpriseparty20: League is pvpv
[1:50:43] eli_sundayx: hate that take
[1:50:44] Madgeneto: but not an mmo
[1:50:45] Standy94: Do PvP players have an easier transition to Pve or opposite?
[1:50:47] lathander557: Been playing a lot of the finals lately, turbo fun and easy to get into and back out of
[1:50:51] rustycans: Oh yeah I love FPS games where someone has a controller with aimbot
[1:50:52] Squats3: RGBs are very hard to get into now. the basic pug RGB is basically win-win-win-win-win-loss-disb and
[1:50:52] anmusallam: nah wow pvp is where its at
[1:50:54] TheItalianStallion321: LETS GO LIQUID
[1:50:57] Cafe0le: you should try it arenas are fun as fuck
[1:50:59] Dasptic: my problem with pvp is if i want to go hardcore I feel I have to change all my keybinds to make sense for pvp instead of pve and thats just too much work
[1:50:59] eatclentrenh: randomly?
[1:50:59] m1lkman10: Did you end up playing only up on stream?
[1:51:16] goombacci: true
[1:51:20] kniftty: Just accepting that its part of it, or deciding you dont like it. basically
[1:51:21] Squats3: but if your a strict MMO gamer, wow easily has the best pvp of any mmo.
[1:51:21] nyshindysheen: kekw
[1:51:22] Seventhedeadly: dewRise dewRise dewRise dewRise dewRise dewRise
[1:51:24] anmusallam: just play dk immune to everything

[1:51:27] mrbonoso: Sometimes you just die in 2s while not being able to do shit
[1:51:28] dulgr_1: To be fair though, there is no pvp like WoW pvp.  Its basically a live chess game.
[1:51:30] Standy94: WM first boss has mind control lol
[1:51:33] Alarius_: @Maximum i think wow pvp should be split off into its own game so that balancing wont affect pve and vice versa
[1:51:35] thecajuncommie: @Maximum id love to stick around for the rest of the stream but I gotta watch season 3 of Slow Horses, Gary Oldman fucking rules, love you bye
[1:51:35] Hacan85: undercover rbg leading lessgo

[1:51:38] JeffMich09: LETS GO, PIKABOO ABOUT TO POP OFF

[1:51:48] dulgr_1: Fair
[1:51:52] Powzoar: what about for 10k?\
[1:51:58] regular_rusty: the pve equivalent is having to wait to push phases
[1:52:00] lathander557: Wow pvp is just so complex compared to how it used to be
[1:52:01] Cafe0le: the move banner Pog
[1:52:06] TheItalianStallion321: LETS GO LIQUI
[1:52:06] LuciFeariUm: @Standy94 its 1 of 5 people and it happens for like 6 seconds twice in an entire 30 minute dungeon..
[1:52:08] TheItalianStallion321: LIQUID
[1:52:08] knersh_: I think Wow is missing an immunity bar lke swtor in pvp when you get stuned for a certain amount you get immune to cc/stuns
[1:52:08] LuciFeariUm: t??
[1:52:09] nameyourform: eiya didnt even pick liquid 😂
[1:52:09] dulgr_1: Im just imaging u Growh and Dorki attempting to grind 2.1k in 3s
[1:52:09] pnguinwow: eiya aint even pick her own org sheesh
[1:52:14] Zaneysed: id rather shave my head than do 3's
[1:52:14] Standy94: Ven and Eiya are traitors to Liquid!
[1:52:15] bigmeanbeefy: Something is a shame, tbh because like you said, the combat is amazing, but sitting in cc half the match isnt fun
[1:52:15] TyHeals: Na I'd rather slurp
[1:52:16] Madgeneto: Gayge
[1:52:18] lathander557: that logo is pog
[1:52:18] Squats3: @Maximum is  The Move's logo a... short bus? it is, isnt it?
[1:52:26] Nonnar: Eiya and Ven disrespecting Liquid
[1:52:31] vataru_guy: Me :)
[1:52:33] Standy94: The Frogs are lit
[1:52:35] goombacci: that logo goes hard
[1:52:37] Madgeneto: Pog
[1:52:37] TheEyeVII: @bloodbane1738 unironically, you can ask trill that very question ;)
[1:52:37] JeffMich09: @maximum I feel the same way I tried Arena in wotlk original and main warlock and I felt like I just spent games cc'd
[1:52:39] sim967: move has best logo
[1:52:40] Squats3: its a short bus
[1:52:42] fenthwl: Frogs that are pretty powerful
[1:52:44] Sovice: They're got a stacked ass roster
[1:52:44] expo513: frogs that are powerful

[1:53:14] Doomtree71: the move are a scary team
[1:53:17] dulgr_1: rsham is sterge's best healer
[1:53:17] Humantelope: @maximum would you queue up some PVP for some oral treats from a strange dude behind a Denny's at 3am?
[1:53:18] Standy94: Sam is the secret stoner goat
[1:53:18] brutalums: why is liquid and the move always goin against eachother?! is this a bracket flaw or is this the championship??
[1:53:20] anmusallam: idk who to support theyre all awesome
[1:53:25] goombacci: this is unironically the final
[1:53:29] WolfgangAmpersand: cdew cam oh boy

[2:10:37] Standy94: How mad will you be if your kid prefers Fortnite
[2:10:39] daiger5o: Kid raising stream when
[2:10:42] Banoffeh: have a kid at 40, retire, become luke from outdoor boys
[2:10:43] JDoubleWho: Daycare is nothing, biggest impact to career is school hours and having work flexible around those start & stop times
[2:10:44] Thoreya: yeah but when ru ready, i guess is the question

[2:11:47] zeitgeiz: been off grid all weekend, looks like Max was right about that e-girl list being a mistake lol
[2:11:47] TheItalianStallion321: @Maximum you may have time...but does your girlfriend have time? the body clock, egg timer is real

[2:18:21] MePachew: He was the highest rated on ladder on like 6 classes at the same time last season
[2:18:22] Skerd_: guys been cracked on rogue since he was 10 or some shit
[2:18:23] supercalifragstalistic: Don't count out Super Frogs in lower bracket. Kubzy is insane
[2:18:24] Dasptic: I rememeber when pika was just looked at as "whos this young kid whos just a god rogue"
[2:18:27] whatisthistwitchlol: if liquid wins will you do a cdew in next rwf on your hair and beard?
[2:18:27] bloodstuck2000: He does shit no one else can pull off somehow
[2:18:28] abelknow: I love watching that liquid team lose everytime
[2:18:30] enhancedrane: yeah, tell us the shit on Sam at Blizzcon
[2:18:30] JeffMich09: He will 1v2 in arena drunk holding his drink in 1 hand its nuts
[2:18:32] Themselves: Liquid orange
[2:18:33] Gh0stProject: pika is prolly the best rogue in pvp
[2:18:33] RenegadeHeals: did you see the clip of him winning arena with his ui turned off
[2:18:34] Alarius_: i mostly know pika for his pvp and i dont even pvp
[2:18:34] zero_coool66: bro can pick up a class and R1
[2:18:34] TroyStory__: He's also arguably best rogue world. At least top 2
[2:18:36] breekicheeki9: i remember him shitting on people when he was like 14 back in the day
[2:18:37] redsmith12: sponserships are dead
[2:18:38] logicaltty: firstGarf
[2:18:39] Powzoar: 2nd liquid team?

[2:18:39] blacklight_____: firstGarf
[2:18:52] hivplus__: @Maximum echo started to play 4 dps in time trials now
[2:19:00] Squats3: @Maximum wouldnt you kknow what the market for a pvp team is?
[2:19:03] Squats3: you kinda.. part own one
[2:19:04] relimee0: the feral durid
[2:19:06] relimee0: is craszy
[2:19:10] De_Alpha: pika is a child prodigy
[2:19:10] fille9302: is e-sport dying?
[2:19:12] TroyStory__: Need a SOLID and GAS team to go with LIQUID
[2:19:13] AvgZee: When does the 3v3 team with Growl and Dorki start?
[2:19:18] Madgeneto: @fille9302 YEP
[2:19:18] burne114: nah I think thats just *** being drunk
[2:19:20] hyruliaa: Just make Liquid pick up the Move aswell, and Liquid will always win Blizzcon
[2:19:22] Nox1o: do their runs just get overwritten? this si weird
[2:19:23] bertsquirts: pika was like rank 1 on like 6 different specs at one time in solo shuffle
[2:19:29] Nox1o: they had healer runs earlier
[2:19:36] pvalue01: no healer keys trigger me
[2:19:39] MBG_95: they havent, the runs were "corrected"
[2:19:39] expo513: feral off healing though
[2:19:40] JengoGG: feral at the start and then swap?
[2:19:43] Goats48: @pvalue01 why
[2:19:43] hivplus__: @Maximum they did the fastest run 1 hour ago
[2:19:48] MBG_95: its the same runs
[2:19:48] Themselves: @pvalue01 good get fucked healer
[2:19:50] 3V3R357: feral confirmed by zaelia
[2:19:50] jandemain: what does druid bring
[2:19:51] Nox1o: the 16:03 time is quite recent, last few hours
[2:19:52] Goats48: @pvalue01 healers are lame
[2:20:04] nykkou55: is he playing feral with HOTW and just giga healing when he needs to?
[2:20:05] Morg1: Could be some weird 5 person meld skip
[2:20:09] pvalue01: @Goats48 indicative of bad design, overall bad for the game
[2:20:12] Anakil_Brusbora: feral does heal quite a bit :p
[2:20:15] Themselves: this game would be better without healers
[2:20:16] Themselves: cope
[2:20:17] Themselves: seethe
[2:20:18] MBG_95: its 100% the same runs just corrected
[2:20:22] biglonelytv: @Maximum what kind of wine do you like
[2:20:22] blacklight_____: my guess is they were with a healer the whole time, they did the latest key with feral, and rio decided that it was always a healer bc it was the same character
[2:20:25] zlncy: RIO was freaking all day yesterday, big susge
[2:20:33] hyruliaa: Feral = high dps, tanky and high off heals
[2:20:33] 3V3R357: he posted a SS in his discord as feral
[2:20:34] Larelulw: does feral have some offheal tech?
[2:20:36] fokare: It said healer earlier
[2:20:37] Monsuno: it's the nature's vigil tech or something
[2:20:38] Ukillay: Rio was down also, so it's prob buggy
[2:20:40] Scoops__: ret pally or augment o.O
[2:20:50] Nox1o: could it be that the role of zaelia is just based on his most recent logout?
[2:20:59] juuno106: El move
[2:21:06] Nox1o: and tournament realm doesnt save what runs actually have
[2:21:13] glitsmonk: so many different liquid raiders on diff teams why dont they just make their own?
[2:21:14] thasthebear: i also dont see zaelia playing feral... if they wanted feral wouldnt meeres play feral and zaelia s priest?
[2:21:16] mox1co: is there a Liquid MDI team?
[2:21:19] Themselves: people still falling for echo bait LMAO
[2:21:25] thatsmybis: Plot twist it's a guardian druid
[2:21:25] Nox1o: echo like 30sec ahaed atm i think
[2:21:25] blacklight_____: @Nox1o seems likely
[2:21:27] Nox1o: yes
[2:21:29] Nox1o: on top
[2:21:31] Sponsorn: raider io seems to be having some kind of issue, tried updating my character, started on a 200k queue, im atm on 237k queue, and it has been going for like 2½ hours LUL
[2:21:31] Nox1o: time trials:teams
[2:21:36] knersh_: next tab
[2:21:43] pvalue01: @Themselves that attitude will just make your queues longer as you sit in LFG for a healer :)
[2:21:47] Goats48: @Goats48 not true because only high end players can pull off no healer keys with hybrid specs. 99% of M+ runs are going to be normal tank.healer,3dps combo.
[2:21:47] Ruinx81: Did you and Naowh sort out your beef?
[2:21:50] Ignite_CLO: which caster will pick echo as a "dark horse" this time
[2:21:56] TyHeals: If warlock/mage/Spriest are meta.. I swear Echo is ahead. They are so good on those classes
[2:21:59] Banoffeh: whats big dorkis team called?
[2:22:02] littleozzieee: How come Liquid doesnt have a team?

[2:22:29] Nox1o: echo ahead, top 3 kinda close, and then the gapping begins
[2:22:32] zhrang911: Its Joever is Drenaco and Splat
[2:22:40] relimee0: joever is yipz
[2:22:41] relentlesszzz: @zhrang911 no not splat
[2:22:43] relimee0: and frag and drenaco
[2:22:44] Nox1o: almost 2 minutes behind to 4th is just crazy
[2:22:45] Themselves: @Themselves i would never pug in this game to let a healer ruin my key
[2:22:45] zhrang911: Sorry, Yipz not splat
[2:23:05] relimee0: its joever is yipz team
[2:23:08] AbieCherry: its joever is kush team @Maximum

[2:23:17] daevyfan: it shows the players in the teams at the top when you click

[2:28:18] anmusallam: i hope cyclone gets a nerf
[2:28:20] hotdogmartyr: cyclone and poly
[2:28:22] Slapsstick: fs
[2:28:22] ghostgiraffee: ya why no cool down??
[2:28:22] Datguyjay: it's easily the best cc in the game next to kidney shot
[2:28:23] Goats48: Cyclone is OP
[2:28:24] AbieCherry: cyclone is the best cc in the game

[2:28:27] AbieCherry: with polymorph
[2:28:28] Dreddmar: cyclone is number 1 because its attacched to the healer
[2:28:28] greatangelsanguinius: they gotta make less PVP less complicated to make it big again
[2:28:29] Zephn: WW needs Jesus in PvE and I really hope war within provides
[2:28:30] LuciFeariUm: clone is pound for pound the best
[2:28:31] LuciFeariUm: for sure

[2:29:02] Zephn: You can spirit link on a cyclone though
[2:29:03] soryn24: It became way more OP after the CC nerfs. It used to be balanced bc of its DR and low duration.
[2:29:16] biglonelytv: @Maximum what kind of wine do you like

[2:29:19] thatsmybis: firstGarf
[2:29:19] dBison24: yeah, its really annoying when you start putting damage on someone, someone clones a lot of your damage off
[2:29:29] hotdogmartyr: supatease is an insane broadcastor
[2:29:35] Slapsstick: cloning kill target while i have healer blinded Pog
[2:29:35] dBison24: like imagine a sin rogue puts deathmark on someone and they get cloned immediately
[2:29:41] LuciFeariUm: abs is just down on mana again bro
[2:29:57] Dasptic: how many battle pets does trill have tho?
[2:29:58] thatsmybis: Kungen is the best player in the world

[2:30:04] dBison24: probably one of the most well rounded players
[2:30:09] Lemunkel: lorgok is clearly the goat
[2:30:12] LazerBeemz: Trill's real legal name is Trillbert, named after his great great grandfatherf
[2:30:12] Madgeneto: i mean if you combine pvp and pve he's obviously the best

[3:00:18] soddalele: shadowmelding spitefuls?
[3:00:21] lathander557: I remember when being a night elf didn't give you a super free vanish
[3:00:22] duckdaring: final boss room
[3:00:23] Nox1o: has to be on 3rd/4th boss or?
[3:00:27] Ibindagado: (in Germany) my mother always called mcD "the Golden seagull" @maximum
[3:00:29] Wiikz: just convinient for alot of patrol skipping or something?
[3:00:31] Nox1o: 2nd boss area you gotta kill riftguys
[3:00:33] Nox1o: anyway
[3:00:33] probdowow: Hey, is feral good ?

[3:00:43] Nakmal: Nakmal subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 14 months! 
[3:00:47] whatisthistwitchlol: i guess u can still swapmaybe pull all ads in first room and cleave them with balls from the maiden
[3:00:48] pax_rush: think sentinel charging is cancelled in first area as well
[3:00:48] dotf_lv: on 3rd boss
[3:00:50] othernewname: pull all from tyr platform and others, then pull 3 guys in sand and jump over sand?
[3:00:53] TBouse: send someone early to start morchie RP
[3:00:54] Julebears: meld morchie trash off
[3:01:00] Scoops__: monkaHmm
[3:01:01] enigma7767: inb4 max leaks strat
[3:01:02] knersh_: mabye skip the trash before 2nd or 3rd boss
[3:01:02] Bloosah: acctuly yeah meld to drop combat for portals
[3:01:04] Draedra: maybe consistent skip of the trash before morchie? @Maximum
[3:01:04] abelknow: Aug isn't good my guy
[3:01:06] Viisionz74: Bro its simple i feel because of Mark of the Wild 3% Vers
[3:01:08] blacklight_____: you can just walk around morchie trash chat
[3:01:11] Mattefofan: @Julebears can soothe that
[3:01:15] Nox1o: i feel like vortex is juice in first area
[3:01:18] Cellhawk: Seriously, imagine being a healer in 2023/2024 retail
[3:01:20] Nox1o: but they got dh grip
[3:01:21] pag2: reckon you can despawn the tank and commanders before the 2nd boss?
[3:01:25] Wiikz: @Bloosah probably this actually
[3:01:29] adammeowington: 3rd boss bladestorm?
[3:01:32] Iyni: You can guarantee getting into the portal in 2nd area
[3:01:33] abelknow: Plus spriest omega heal and feral omega heal
[3:01:34] exo_silence: druid stealth for rp trigger morchie?
[3:01:38] ixsacrificexi: morchies clones?
[3:01:40] 16attempts: something with first boss to prevent shield?
[3:01:43] Themselves: do key as resto, hearth out to switch to dps, summon back, ez bait
[3:01:43] lionicicles: maybe you can despawn something
[3:01:47] dogloaf33: maybe something with like single target the guys to open rifts and melding off all the small adds?
[3:01:47] Evilseyes00: does it stop the boss from spinning on horde/alliance fight?
[3:01:55] Benjg7: last trash pack skip?
[3:01:55] Bloosah: @Wiikz he never reads what i write =)
[3:01:59] Newlander: Meld the adds on Morchie? So they never spawn?
[3:02:00] m_dep: @Maximum time lost is the most strange so maybe it helps with one of the minibosses before the first boss? Maybe it lets you spawn all minibosses on top of each other weird?
[3:02:01] soddalele: can u meld spitefuls?
[3:02:03] abelknow: Mage lok cant melt tho
[3:02:05] LeoricDidNothingWrong: you can meld the orbs on 3. boss
[3:02:06] Schlimmy: pulling worms through the wall on battlefield
[3:02:10] blacklight_____: last pack opens door tho
[3:02:11] Betto11: @Maximum is there a way past the 2 dragons or the last pack?
[3:02:11] disiple2507: disiple2507 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 7 months! 
[3:02:11] surpriseparty20: Druid mobility shenanigans
[3:02:15] oneshotelitee: Is it not for the first pull maybe where all those adds that grip you in  so no one has to kick that?
[3:02:15] relicz: you probably would run something other than druid though if it was just nelf, would something like sub have more damage
[3:02:17] Viisionz74: MOTW
[3:02:18] Turbo_WoW: maybe the maze doent throw any balls out if everyone melds @Maximum
[3:02:21] lionicicles: can you snap stuff in the big platform?
[3:02:21] Nox1o: its skipping all the shit trash between with 3rd/4th boss or? cant chain the mantarays because you cant run through the barrier etc
[3:02:21] easyafff: nelf porrtals?"
[3:02:22] Wiikz: @Wiikz what streamer does tho lmao
[3:02:23] hiki23: @Newlander morchie would dissapear too maybe if everyone out of combat
[3:02:24] Ryu2042: cant get into the portals if your in combat right?
[3:02:25] lathander557: Spiteful shades keep you in combnat so no portal
[3:02:25] Nox1o: im sure they dont play that
[3:02:27] ncg20: All meld spiteful for portals?
[3:02:30] missiva: couldnt it be off-tank shenanigans? did some MDI routes do that in Azure Vault with a feral @Maximum
[3:02:31] abelknow: Mage lok cant meld
[3:02:32] mikkinorum: It must be some NE portal tech plus one extra skip somewhere
[3:02:33] whatisthistwitchlol: after 2 dragons in portal room, lock sends gate to first portal, then melds and rp starts before doing all the trash
[3:02:36] szakal_TV: they are just melding prideful
[3:02:38] m_dep: my money is on something with time lost, it forces you to be sequential with the mini bosses and it makes you go less fast
[3:02:44] blacklight_____: you can just skip all that without meld
[3:02:45] Nox1o: and first platform is everything
[3:02:46] Nox1o: probably
[3:02:46] Newlander: @hiki23 Tank doesn't meld then.
[3:02:54] Nox1o: even just for boss funnel
[3:02:54] Bloosah: @Wiikz plenty Sadge
[3:02:55] oneshotelitee: If it's a mega pull with 3 of those dragons you can always just meld the cast on you
[3:02:58] i_cassius: last pack needs to be killed to open door/wall
[3:02:58] Nox1o: so they dont need the trash
[3:03:12] Newlander: Could also be boomkin, uncapped aoe, as the first room is maybe 1 giant pull?
[3:03:13] LuciFeariUm: what if its just some insane gauntlet speed
[3:03:18] lionicicles: maybe they'll pull the other adds on the first platform for count?
[3:03:18] omega88: Its gotta be portal room rp melding, pull the mobs to start the rp
[3:03:21] Wiikz: @Wiikz xdd
[3:03:21] blacklight_____: feral might be a play to absolutely destroy Tyr with trash on top of it
[3:03:40] oneshotelitee: I'm pretty sure it's for the first pull you can't use it any other place maybe for dots at the end
[3:03:40] stljay73: Could it be similair to Shadowmoon gathering tech, using feral
[3:03:40] midiansgod: Good evening everyone :)
[3:03:47] othernewname: speed buffim pretty sure they go to the other platforms and skip a lot in sand area
[3:03:47] nuka73: is feral
[3:03:47] TBouse: surely the start revolves around getting morchie RP started because that is the most inefficient part of the key
[3:03:47] Bloosah: @Wiikz but hey, we accept it with a smile :)
[3:03:49] teqlamage: Feral with Apex procs?
[3:03:55] Nox1o: i feel like the first pull is dying insanely quick on 23 anyway. with the orb stunning and doing dmg too
[3:03:55] velle014: Maybe they do everything in first room, those unmarked adds with boss so they need to clear less in second, and they activate portals with meld
[3:04:01] PlebianNoob: does skipping a phase of the first boss save that much time? Maybe it is just a hands dif
[3:04:05] MelipnosTV: sounds like u play enhance and then you kick him from the grp after first platform
[3:04:10] apocalypse912: what if zaelia is tanking on bear and they are doing 2 sides at the same time with split groups? Kappa
[3:04:16] Wiikz: @Wiikz indeed :)
[3:04:18] Ignite_CLO: LMAO dude the eu winner got interviewed after their win, said fuck during the interview, apologized for it and sait it again 2 seconds later LUL
[3:04:18] oneshotelitee: But portal doesn't spawn then
[3:04:19] LuciFeariUm: what if its just some insane gauntlet speed 󠀀

[4:01:40] Squats3: oh boy not the rap game
[4:01:55] demepunkk: 21 savage just dropped an album with drake too
[4:01:56] Themselves: adin would let 21 shoot him on cam as long as it'd keep him coming on stream

[4:02:42] PlebianNoob: Streaming is also fun for people
[4:02:44] Xann_: @Maximum I imagine you're right, he'd prob still wanna be cool.  But the stream after it happened was so fucking awkward, the vibes were hella off.
[4:02:45] Ignite_CLO: @jberry no liquid is already in the finals
[4:02:46] Docaan: and meth
[4:02:46] AvgZee: Whens the gambling with Ion stream

[4:03:15] demepunkk: Adin is the biggest kick streamer still lmao
[4:03:16] jondbr: def fell off hes wild
[4:03:16] Docaan: is tom brady the same with not wanting to quit ?
[4:03:33] Voriq: Myth is example sadly
[4:03:43] equinox_flare: its mentally destroying having 1 tweet pop off and then never again getting any attention
[4:03:48] spivet: Being famous seems like an absolute nightmare to me
[4:03:48] fdb33: brady just addicted to competition
[4:03:54] whatisthistwitchlol: dude ninja would be insane in wow
[4:04:02] whatisthistwitchlol: imagine him doing keys with viewers
[4:04:04] enigma7767: that times square incident
[4:04:06] demepunkk: The same thing with Atheletes. Their day to day is wake up, train, sleep, repeat. but when they are retired its so bad for their mental
[4:04:17] jitsuttv: This stream is gunna be a "react" on YouTube to create drama. Calling it now.
[4:04:24] Instantgator: @enigma7767  Aware

[4:04:29] jawnwest: does he still stream
[4:04:29] yuhhhhe: @Maximum do you think about what happens if you fall off?
[4:04:30] larkhill: ninja dancing during new years live 2018 and failing was hilarious
[4:04:31] Wmage: Take mitch jones for example
[4:04:38] surpriseparty20: Insert the "Oh no. Anyway" top gear meme
[4:04:40] Madgeneto: @jawnwest he does
[4:04:42] Squats3: @Maximum but also ninja got a sweet mixer deal like shroud so theres no chance is isnt just sitting pretty. but yeah im sure it was rough
[4:04:46] sauron644: sauron644 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 34 months! Paugmentation
[4:04:46] shlukkiguden: mitch lmao
[4:04:48] synex3: think it can also be on the flipside, that ppl are fine with falling off, for example tyler1 was really huge and seems fine now with 20k viewers
[4:04:51] Smartaxe: i think you are reading too much
[4:04:52] othernewname: @Madgeneto he went to microsfot streaming platform, mixer
[4:04:58] Themselves: yea and then u have someone like shroud who didnt care about losing his audience to stream on mixer, and then came back just as big lmao
[4:05:02] Hairoglyph: i mean hes still known widely
[4:05:09] whatisthistwitchlol: mitch jones shows up for 2 weeks every 2 months, gets 10k viewers and then goes back to doing whatever he does
[4:05:11] othernewname: @larkhill KEKW that was painful
[4:05:30] shlukkiguden: crack
[4:05:37] bglpuppy2: Anyone who plays the I'm richer than you game is broke af
[4:05:37] flippyoka: never realized pvp players had to deal with spires bs KEKW
[4:05:43] demepunkk: you can't go from top twitch streamer for a year or so to working a day job either, its just rough on mental health
[4:05:48] jitsuttv: @larkhill I just watched it. Holy shit thats cringe lol
[4:05:52] rues16: do you guys think its easy to get into/enjoy pvp? ive always wanted to try but im unsure its worth
[4:06:01] Wmage: @whatisthistwitchlol You forgot the part how he guilt trips his viewers by being extra depressed cuz he felt off, then does the whole thing over again
[4:06:02] Squats3: @Maximum i think myth took it pretty well. he said he was happy that it happened and not sad that he fell off
[4:06:04] PlebianNoob: LUL
[4:06:05] Mfkr90: link it

[4:07:33] miniath_: myth has translated that mania into a pretty stable streaming career out of it tbf, whereas ninja...
[4:07:38] Ruinx81: Nnja made bank when he went to that MS streaming platform
[4:07:58] Madgeneto: im lagging
[4:08:14] demepunkk: Mixer made him millions, he doesn't stream for money
[4:08:22] lostamongliars: hindsight is 50/50, now you know that, that kind of a rise is bound to fall but that was a new thing back then, you couldn't tell as to how much your viewership would fall
[4:08:33] VinnieK_: Its about drive, its about power
[4:08:33] gergrunt: I am no ninja truther, but has Ninja said/done something recently to suggest his mental is gone?
[4:08:35] meatballblastero: do they not know that theyre the fortnite guy?
[4:08:36] Ripen94: Ripen94 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 13 months! 
[4:08:37] Axl_Rose94: i think ninja fell off cause he left fortnite for a while, but he isnt in a bad position today right?
[4:08:38] rues16: ninja tried to get into valo and it was terrible lol
[4:08:38] enigma7767: its 100% reason to remember the name. /s

[4:23:34] cloorogue: @Nox1o sometime it comes down to trading cds at times, like sometimes people just drain mana by spam healing instead of trading a cd. Since void didn't exactly have the most pressure all game, the momentum just let absterge spam heal instead of trade which lead him to go lower in mana.

[5:41:41] hawkinz85: it is a thing
[5:41:42] kreyzy8: its 100% a thing
[5:41:42] vigilantknives: that is kinda a thing
[5:41:42] tykus21: Liquid actually is a good conductor of heat, they are probably warmed up well.
[5:41:42] bazefacee: being warmed up in pvp is def a thing though
[5:41:43] Yagr6: iceing the kicker
[5:41:47] shaayynee: trust, it is a thing
[5:41:51] synex3: depends, if its lan u wanna be coming from lower finals
[5:41:51] TheGreatBtz: @AbieCherry Chatting
[5:41:52] finvek: momentum is a factor
[5:41:53] Seventhedeadly: Liquid played them before.. then the move already knew what they were going to play and how they were going to play.. Whizz went to Orc which helps kill the stuns
[5:41:55] regzinold: someone get pika a back brace
[5:41:55] misran: buncha stephen A smiths in the chat xdd
[5:41:59] elysona: Liquid about to lock WW dk and just fuck wizk

[5:42:06] AbieCherry: Momentum helps a lot
[5:42:07] the_kev_gaming: spriest dmg is disgusting
[5:42:07] zachfactor88: lower bracket run is so mentally exhausting
[5:42:12] insatiablemop: watching pika play rogue in awc is like watching imfiredup play mage in rwf. both absolute maniacs at their trades
[5:42:14] Polen: so that doesnt mean anything
[5:42:15] synex3: @Maximum think in lan it matters, coming from lower i think is better
[5:42:16] hotdogmartyr: wizk is build diff
[5:42:23] hawckbane: was that last game?
[5:42:29] anmusallam: ew the bastion map
[5:42:29] conchelobe: Wizks damage is nuts
[5:42:32] Kurtisthelol: I think being in the upper side is 10000% better than playing through lower
[5:42:33] BigBadAzz1: You know I've played everyday about 95% since Legion
[5:42:45] Vynarian: Fighting games it can matter
[5:42:48] dawnshot03: is there a reason wizk has so much more damage then liquids guys
[5:42:50] boomiexd: losers bracket buff is real
[5:42:55] saminthetwitch: @Maximum i think it was pika saying that it does matter because you get mroe adjustedto your setup, chair monitor etc
[5:43:03] shaayynee: MDI is a diff game tho from pvp
[5:43:05] Polen: they probably are doing a couple arenas to stay sharp while waiting
[5:43:08] Polen: and talking about things

[5:43:46] nightst314: those guys hate horses
[5:43:47] Aessari: The losers bracket in this format is so stupid. There's no typical advantage for coming through winners.

[5:46:00] vonson: if she can cook then you lie to her and say it's good
[5:46:01] LordScrooblord: If someone wanted to improve at poetry they would show someone who knows what they're talking about for poetry

[5:46:57] logicaltty: i think there's a difference between if they're doing it for fun or if they're actually trying to make art
[5:47:05] Nifflies: someone will be honest with her.. then she will be mad at you for lying!

[5:47:33] antipheonixna: as long as ur not good at the thing, just being supportive is fine, if she continues down the path she will meet ppl who she can get real feedback from
[5:47:34] GhostdadUC: my wife didn't have any hobbies for almost 2 years and I would have killed for her to pick up something and be bad at it

[5:48:38] armpowerlifting: if someone genuinely wants to be better at something and you lie to them to make them feel like they’re better than they are, you’re really doing the opposite of helping them
[5:48:43] antipheonixna: ok if its food tho u have to shut that shit down fast
[5:48:46] i_cassius: my wife’s hobby is moaning at me
[5:48:52] meatballblastero: I assure you this is a grey parse in poetry
[5:49:04] jvmes_r6: no hobbies = they prolly watched unsolved crime docs all day lol

[5:50:15] whoknowsdude_: holy
[5:50:15] prismo5: bring on mes
[5:50:15] Kurtisthelol: pika is just not really playing the game for more than like 10 seconds at a time
[5:50:16] anmusallam: wtf happened
[5:50:17] Mecabeast: it feels strange seeing outlaw in pvp cause i always felt it was a pve spec
[5:50:17] surpriseparty20: Ooooof

[5:50:34] Tambandia: This AWC has been fucking hype
[5:50:37] DeSwedishDude: @flippyoka ye
[5:50:40] kallisz: @whatisthistwitchlol not rly, depends on cd timings, but kinda
[5:50:46] Yagr6: but you have to greed right
[5:50:49] surpriseparty20: Idk Move have a huge momentum this series it feels liks
[5:50:51] Nox1o: PvP is like hiit training. You press buttons for a few seconds, then chill for a few seconds
[5:50:53] armpowerlifting: trill looks like lebron in his prime he’s got this
[5:51:02] miraagex: healing in pvp games ResidentSleeper
[5:51:03] tehKrazeee: Last year was similar. Sam kept getting focused and killed. They gotta play smart and patient so The Move wastes their initiation
[5:51:20] Emose: @kallisz i guess i never pop my cds with lust huh
[5:51:24] Tsarfun: Why is trill doing 2x Pika's dmg?
[5:51:26] Cafe0le: @miraagex more like monkaW
[5:51:30] Tsarfun: Every game Trill is 2x the dmg
[5:51:38] Thoreya: WW DK
[5:51:48] AbieCherry: No bear
[5:51:56] armpowerlifting: pika is getting cloned by Sam that’s why damage low
[5:51:58] anmusallam: @Tsarfun cyclone
[5:52:00] whatisthistwitchlol: lust prepull, hold your cds for the 2 minute mark, then finish on the 3d minute with a bang
[5:52:04] synex3: @Tsarfun he isnt sitting in clone kekw
[5:52:11] Yagr6: what would mes bring in??
[5:52:12] miraagex: @Cafe0le it's boring af
[5:52:12] GrimFandango: chat what do they mean when they say "clone"?
[5:52:12] honeyyyyyy: My wife loves the ballet. I fucking hate the ballet. After she brought me the first time I lied and said that I really enjoyed it. Now it's cursed because now she surprises me with tickets 2-3 times a year and I feel like I can't tell her the truth. She goes to NHL games with me and I'm sure it's not her favorite. Any advice?
[5:52:12] Tombah: @Tsarfun pika sitting in cyclones half the game
[5:52:13] Nox1o: @Tsarfun because pika cant play the game, 2 disarm, perma cloned etc
[5:52:17] Koliap: If he trinks early he gets silenced and Hex was on the way
[5:52:19] zachfactor88: trill and pika are playing dfiff roles in their comps
[5:52:38] Aessari: @Maximum don't you think it's stupid that coming in through winners gives you no bracket/point advantage? Its the whole point of this system :/
[5:52:46] kallisz: @Emose not sure what youre saying, but aint no way most top parses of mythic bosses are like 50 sec, 2 min classes would do more damage in 2min 30s than 2 min flat
[5:52:46] Emose: @whatisthistwitchlol time to go wail on a dummy now for practice
[5:52:46] Kurtisthelol: trill is having fun doing dmg and pika is getting clapped by cc
[5:52:50] Cakerinotv: its inverse LUL
[5:52:53] Aro725: trill and sam both have disarm as well. pika just has a hard time trying to do damage
[5:52:53] Crucaider: Zero sum game for healing
[5:52:54] Koliap: The main issue was Absterge got Cdew in the middle for Pika to chain CC them
[5:53:05] surprizeyatwo: They should show some cc kicks or fake cast breakdowns would be pog
[5:53:07] bergy101: unless they don't which indicates falling behind
[5:53:08] kniftty: Or if they wanted to pick out a section of 15-30 seconds where the healing fell behind and never caught up or something
[5:53:11] kniftty: Dont just show the whole match
[5:53:15] drewsky96: I think more interesting would be damage done by specific abilities over time
[5:53:17] Shad_WW: sp damage is so insane
[5:53:21] GadgetCopter: kind of. Sometimes you get wild shit like warlocks doing half the healing of the healer
[5:53:23] Kurtisthelol: mind spike insanity hitting for 200k is nuts
[5:53:24] whatisthistwitchlol: @Emose remember potion+phial+weapon enchantment
[5:53:24] drewsky96: then it would at least be analyzable
[5:53:25] ahri_feet_connoisseur: As an artist, I will say for sure there's a lot of unskilled artists (no ego). Simply because art is so hard to get good at
[5:53:25] d_mag4: last minute could be valid tho
[5:53:32] exz_96: trill should go back to ww cant keep up with pika
[5:53:32] Mecabeast: i think the healing done is more to show mana efficiency?
