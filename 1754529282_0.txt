[2:01:46] Eploar: What is going on, why is Bone Buds wiping on first boss solo?
[2:01:54] Crossed_96: +22 is not that hard, having to compete against another team is what makes it hard

[2:02:34] Tryptiic: there is a difference between timing a +22 with a guild group and speedrunning a +22 with an mdi group
[2:02:34] Mokkun: I know I haven't been playing since last expansion, but as a feral main it's really weird to see ferals on these teams.
[2:02:44] Elkethus: @Crossed_96 exactly especially with the crazy pull they are doing and the pressure too. I mean 22 are challenging for sure but if you only aim to make timer is less hard than what they do those people actually push 26/27 key in time in general

[2:06:51] Eploar: @happyheals Yeah, they planned it for sure. But I don't think they expected to win that first CoS run. It was even incredibly close, considering how they oofed the spy.
