[3:14:18] ghxst_online: "While breaking the EULA is unlikely to result in legal action being taken against you, due in part to the difficulty of enforcing it, there are other ramifications. If you currently play World of Warcraft, Blizzard may permanently ban your account, losing any of your progress in the game, though as far as we know they‚Äôve sued no one for playing with a private server." - TECHNICALLY ILLEGAL TO PLAY

[3:15:51] ArukuGaming: There we go
[3:16:16] ghxst_online: sure, but it still doesnt escape the fact, it's illegal to run a private server, it's illegal to play on a private server. thats the rules as written.
