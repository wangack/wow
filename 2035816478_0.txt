[2:24:20] JonaDefty: give 70% shadowflame and nerf the drain shit
[2:24:27] toshko321: do you like warlocks in SoD?
[2:24:36] Jackherrerr: drain life is bugged
[2:24:38] Inzio: i feel like i havent seen a reason for spriest to not have mana issues, im still going to main it either way
[2:24:57] toshko321: why will they be worst at 40?
[2:25:09] SnowtaTheGoata: got the staff tonight on my boomie <3
[2:25:22] moistspeedo: i feel like mage will be op with shatter and icelance
[2:25:48] Nerfed4U: yo, tab over to warrior and see if you can spawn at the summon spot
[2:25:59] inspect4: When did shadowflame snare become a thing, in cata?
[2:26:17] Nerfed4U: yes
[2:26:20] nikthevoker: i solod it
[2:26:30] moistspeedo: you can solo it if you have retaliation up
[2:26:33] toshko321: i think the runes will change things up at lvl 40 for locks

[2:30:39] RoidRage44: saw him on retail
[2:31:00] Inzio: he thinks he has a hernia so he ended stream early
[2:31:05] Inzio: going to the doctor tomorrow
[2:31:33] JaelawTV: ye lets google that
[2:31:36] Inzio: when you stress your body out too much pretty much
[2:31:54] Derezzed01: intestines poke through muscle lining near abdomen
[2:31:59] Derezzed01: so it sticks out
[2:32:09] bigfangodx: wait what happened to bean?
[2:32:13] Twistnectar: damn, loook at that Snutz HP lol 735, oof.
[2:33:26] Twistnectar: just ran the worst BFD ever lol
[2:33:29] Twistnectar: rage quitters
[2:33:30] Derezzed01: what do you think SoD needs
[2:33:31] michmichhlol: !addon
[2:33:56] Derezzed01: true
[2:34:11] notJONNOJ: and u need to get some head lil bro 😭😭😭
[2:34:12] fergbongo: Sod needs more raids
[2:34:17] cxkfatality: i like the level cap, however the length of the phases is WAYYY to long
[2:34:23] StreamElements: All information regarding my addons, characters, or boosts will be found in my discord: https://discord.gg/eMTkkB3
[2:35:03] notJONNOJ: you pretty much at a point where youre over pvp? @snutzy
[2:35:09] notJONNOJ: or arenas i should say
[2:35:49] bestworldtv: let's be honest, the community is what makes the pvp scene not fun anymore
[2:35:49] notJONNOJ: yeah i feel it, last time drakes were going out in tbc i didnt even get the dopamine rush anymore
[2:35:52] Derezzed01: you're never over server based world pvp, what you talkin about
[2:36:01] cheesedikk: is ele viable in sod right now snutzyy
[2:36:29] Derezzed01: hahash yea
[2:36:53] bestworldtv: omg water totem is so cursed
[2:37:00] bestworldtv: have fun running for 6 years
[2:38:27] bestworldtv: indefinite endgame for SoD has a lot of possibilities
[2:38:56] creaturesfan72: i think the longer phases will be more fun the higher the cap
[2:39:06] bestworldtv: Twilight highlands, Gilneas, hyjal, troll islands etc.
[2:39:07] creaturesfan72: but yeah cap rn is a bit long
[2:39:23] GrewUpaFKNscrewUp: I absolutely loved the cap, made me appreciate the zones as opposed to just breezing through them
[2:39:27] dildyj: well remember sod is seasonal, so the lifetime is probably only around a year
[2:39:43] Releaserage: im just glad it didnt come out middle of christmas
[2:40:03] kamikazis: i bet tehy thought that if they got bored of this version theyd check out wrath, and then maybe buy dragonflight when they get bored of that
[2:40:07] creaturesfan72: yeah they had two weeks off during holidays
[2:40:27] RocsGaming: one thing ive learned it is okay to play other games in the down time
[2:40:40] RocsGaming: its also cause d4 new season comes out on the 23rd
[2:40:44] RocsGaming: cant clash with that
[2:40:52] fanniclap: Haven't played retail since cata and I logged in like a month ago and was so overwhelmed rofl
[2:40:53] Oreo_Swagwagon: What's your p2 prep right now?
[2:41:24] Releaserage: i still play diablo 2 ressurected Kreygasm
[2:41:27] fanniclap: D4 endgame was so terrible
[2:41:58] benoTTV: d4 was like the most profit blizzard has ever made on a game
[2:42:26] gapthescene: looking forward to d4 s3
[2:42:50] fanniclap: They don't focus on pvp and I think pvp is what kept D2 going for so long no? I mean I played d2 for YEARS and all I did was pvp.
[2:43:03] th1nk0utloud: what the most fun you've had playing wow the last 2 years - what iteration of the game?
[2:43:08] csant1023: d4 was great for the story... no replayability at all
[2:43:09] Releaserage: theres a built in rune thinie with rested xp if u have it installed
[2:43:12] fanniclap: But D2 pvp in d4 with people complaining nowadays about BM wouldnt fly
[2:43:46] ndras: d4 was bobby retirement plan
[2:44:33] ManiacTheZealot: I thought the graphics looked pretty drab unless you stopped and looked closely at them. But nobody wants to stop and look at stuff in an action rpg. Nothing was very distinctive looking when you were blasting through it.
[2:45:58] ndras: if lost ark wasnt pay 2 win it would be huge by now
[2:46:12] ndras: missed chance by kr
[2:46:20] OBgaming: more to the left
[2:46:22] bestworldtv: korean mmo being pay to win? Who woulda thought
[2:46:28] ndras: combat in LA was so good
[2:46:53] gapthescene: 100% of korean games are comepletely pay to win as well
[2:46:56] acaman: i dont think anime style was the problem
[2:47:02] kukionz: you been doing arena lately?
[2:47:06] DerpTDG: fuck goin on
[2:47:08] ndras: style was fine west is crazy about weeb stuff nowdays
[2:47:11] ManiacTheZealot: Ya, the stats on the gear were quite confusing and didn't seem to allow you to do anything cool unlike set bonuses in D3.
[2:47:17] ndras: its gearing progress n shit that killed it
[2:47:25] bestworldtv: last asian game I played was Aion and it was terrible
[2:47:33] bestworldtv: many years ago now ofc
[2:47:35] DerpTDG: u guys talking about lost ark?
[2:47:37] DerpTDG: that shit was so fun
[2:47:37] OBgaming: southwest
[2:47:38] HornyTheUnicorn: !song
[2:47:38] StreamElements: @HornyTheUnicorn failed to get the current song.
[2:48:07] DerpTDG: yeah it was incredibly p2w
[2:48:09] HornyTheUnicorn: hi what was that song
[2:48:16] eaiello420: big lakers W !
[2:48:27] bestworldtv: yep, all the whales are in asia, too
[2:48:33] DerpTDG: i no lifed that game for the first few weeks it was out on NA
[2:48:40] ryanbrolol: I was just thinking that the gaming community calls out P2W bs, but for some reason TCGs get a pass, and their the most money hungry games per content
[2:49:07] gapthescene: asians eat that pay to win shit up, they absolutely love it
[2:49:41] Sqwibbie: Pls god no arena in sod lol
[2:49:53] ndras: id play 5v5 in sod
[2:49:57] ndras: but no 3s 2s
[2:50:23] Sqwibbie: i wanna see a ton of little contested zones at 60 haha
[2:50:31] Sqwibbie: Not arena for sod
[2:50:33] Sqwibbie: personally
[2:50:38] DerpTDG: gimme that cata beta
[2:50:49] Sqwibbie: Cata arena gonna hit diff
[2:50:56] Sqwibbie: I loved cata arena
[2:50:58] DerpTDG: dude wow is just sooo boring rn Sadge
