[2:13:25] TheRavenGrave: I think that will be a correction bliz will make
[2:13:49] NBK_Sethus: who can blame them? raid and dungeon mechanics almost exclusively punish healers, its such a shit job
[2:13:53] Kaype92: Also be aware towelliee that from personal experience with wasting gold. There is a skill cap for crafting certain gear where even using 3 star mats, crafters still won’t be able to make gear past a certain point. I’ve had crafting orders from people telling me to resell 3 star mats and use the 2 stars instead since they literally can’t make stuff past a certain point even with inspiration.
[2:14:19] TheRavenGrave: i was a healer but when i did randoms could never find a tank

[2:22:05] Syprus1: encrypted inspired me to create a rogue named Urh
[2:23:08] king_julian_96: well you kind of did what made infested aidds was if you did'nt kill the worms right after kill trash pack threy would run to another trash pack and empower them

[2:31:02] FleetAdmiralSalacnar: I feel like Felicia the Frosty Proto-Drake will be the 10.1 boss in Vakthros
[2:31:16] king_julian_96: i mean they could but in the cinematic they made out those 3 dragosn were a big deal and a big threat so i would find it a bit underwhelming if we just killed off all 3 of them in a suingle dungeon

[2:36:52] Tribica1987: Hi there; do you mind sharing tips about your keybinds please  (changing form what is best... etc)  will start playing drood  tank and dps for first time, casual user here, decent knowledge of the game.
[2:38:10] king_julian_96: the reason for my thinking is if they kill off all 3 of the remaining big bad dragons all in the  next major patch then who is goign to be the big bad in 10.2 and be the big bad of the whole expac in 10.3
[2:40:24] bob_tables: @Tribica1987 q,e,r,f,t,f,g,c,v,1,2,3,4,5, M4, M5 and shift modifiers on those. should get you a long way.
[2:41:18] king_julian_96: no galakrond

[2:42:34] DrakeDuude: for real
[2:42:37] Syprus1: as long as they arent dragon their feet releasing content
[2:42:44] king_julian_96: so you think the end game boss for this whole expac toweliee is going to be chromatis what makes you think that
[2:43:44] Onixqt: @towelliee i wanna see Galakrond resorected
[2:44:23] Zettabyte: Nah I get what you're trying to say, just messing with ya xD
[2:44:38] king_julian_96: but it's a dragon expac toweliee what do you expect it's literally in the name dragonflight like first word in the expac is dragon so  if we had mostly dragon raids it would make sense why woudl you be surprised when it's literally in the expansion name
[2:44:46] CrankyXer: Revendreth is one of my fav zones ever, looks and theme wise, didn't help me like Shadowlands any though.

[3:49:20] Proto_Paradigm: The only problem with Cosmic Anamoly is that it doesn't shield more than two people.  It used to shield up to4 or 5 within it's radius but they killed that.

[3:49:39] Owenzzz123: seems cool
[3:49:40] Zendero89: @Owenzzz123 only jade temple this season
[3:49:41] pereadin: @molvonos nothing wrong with it persay. Just a lot of the high keyers aren’t running that.
[3:49:42] NightHawk91: Which is really great imo
[3:49:45] theslingers: hey this the towlie alt shadowcannon from HALLOWED ?
[3:49:58] Sylphy_TV: There are so many dungeons, why only 8 LUL to much work?
[3:50:18] Hamners: I just hope they dont stop there...Id like to see more older areas made relevant again
[3:50:28] Molvonos: @Proto_Paradigm It shields two people per pulse, but not the same 2 people.  Plus, it's absorbing damage, so Mortal Strike abilities are better mitigated from what i've experienced.  Couple that with Stasis and you can rip out 4 Temporal Anomolies pretty fast.

[3:57:34] s7wede: if everybody stands up stairs and you tank boss at the bottom, the fire waves don't reach the rest of the party
[3:57:58] andres_1123: Everbloom or skyreach coming next season
[3:58:12] NightHawk91: i liked everbloom
[3:58:33] andres_1123: They are probably gonna get one or 2 from the survey they asked last season

[5:27:37] Zzz_wipeout_zzZ: depending on his build the ww might not have the interupt half of the wowhead talent trees don't have interupts and people follow them like sheep

[5:37:34] NewWorldReign: what is the item level for max level mythics?
[5:37:36] remixonfire91: do you think they should increase the amount of gear you can get in the vault? from 1 to 2 pieces
[5:37:39] WeedFranck: you run m+ for vault KEKW
[5:37:52] 3663Sharad: Imo Blizz should revert the 2 items per dungeon. Ilvls are spread out so much that gearing takes a while @Towelliee
[5:37:56] WidePeepoDuck: @zilberg grats 😊
[5:38:06] Nokterian: and the valor i send it to upgrade my gear
[5:38:10] WeedFranck: I did run a +8 this week, KEKW
[5:38:13] Nokterian: spend*
[5:38:18] Zilberg: Thank you WidePeepoDuck
[5:38:24] pereadin: Dorki or yumy was talking about this the other night @towelliee where they felt gearing should be faster. That a mythic raiders should have near bis by 3-4 weeks in and casual players should only take 5-7 weeks.

[5:46:02] cryft: *dps resources
[5:46:12] JBarlak: @reggiepowa  yes because that little bit of damage is key
[5:46:18] IDecayl: best explanation I read was if you dont do high damage you gunna get aggro'd pulled from you if you play with a dps who is top parsing
[5:46:32] DecayedmiNt: In an idea world as a tank. You're looked at by your dps and how well you'd survive with the least amount of gear possible to funnel to more important roles
[5:46:43] Qelvue: I mean, tank surviving and doing mechanics is assumed, so what to measure would be the difficulty and the dps they do at that difficulty :P
[5:46:43] pereadin: Yeah on loading screen
[5:46:58] reggiepowa: @JBarlak it's key if you are in world first guild killing the final boss on first week, after that I don't think it is
[5:48:07] ChanJustWon: as long as the player can do their job as not dying, tanks that do more dam are better, in raiding at least
[5:48:43] WidePeepoDuck: I did a viewer raid with max one time… those guys are built different
[5:48:56] ImSteveHi: 9/10 times the tanks on the RTWF guilds are out Damaging any PUGs out there
[5:48:57] beerandwaffles: Getting CE the last week before but next patch is not a mythic guild in my eyes
[5:49:02] IDecayl: I guess a tank's dps will throttle everyone else's. If you are not top preforming them you are preventing your dps from top preforming due to aggro
[5:49:20] DecayedmiNt: @Qelvue Survival part of tanking is so low on the tank priority now. It's more a given, the more dps you can push the better. Some even give up defensives to accomplish that
[5:49:43] Sylphy_TV: Cant trust dem deer Frust Murns
[5:49:47] spyrit14: Even DKs all specs have will of the necropolis
[5:49:56] spyrit14: as a passive
[5:50:11] Hirukai: You think Brewmaster is good for M+?
[5:50:13] Qelvue: @Towelliee healer performance varies depending on group composition, the tank performance varies depending on which tank spec is being healed by which healer specs, so may variables compared to dps hitting a target that has a predetermined value xD
[5:50:17] ChanJustWon: @IDecayl not much of an issue in retail raiding as it is in classic
[5:50:37] WidePeepoDuck: no leavers only cleavers, omg 😂😂
[5:51:11] Stixxerz: Stixxerz subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 48 months! 
[5:51:15] REALPolarbeezy: I would rather have a brewmaster personally, they know how to play. They're rare. Anyone can copy paste a meta build and still suck.

[5:51:27] Zilberg: Oh this hunter is doing too much damage.. nerf the warriors KEKW
[5:52:04] spyrit14: Rather than fixing the flaws of each tank, they nerf the top performer, this is lazy coding.
[5:52:05] ChanJustWon: @REALPolarbeezy I've seen almost exclusively bad brews this xpac

[6:10:44] IncNewb: @idecayl what about healer mana? As a healer, if I need to drink it's usually because tank or dps don't play good enough. With good groups I don't need to burn through my mana

[6:14:22] IncNewb: @idecayl yeah I understand, you can check avoidable dmg with details, I usually look at that besides interrupts
[6:15:11] KaisenSiru: anniesRIP naguuraRIP
[6:15:16] Molvonos: Gotta make one go immune for breathing room
[6:15:24] Talason: towelliee do you have your absorb set?
[6:15:33] ChanJustWon: just go for 10 stacks, a few seconds lost is better than minutes lost bc of a wipe
[6:15:34] wreckshoptv: defensive stance maybe :P?
[6:15:37] Molvonos: Immune = No damage, so yea
[6:15:41] Mallaes: everyone is dead!

[6:15:56] Moobot: No need to repeat yourself, @IdleJester (warning)
[6:16:03] IDecayl: @IncNewb does avoidable damage mean things like casts and AOEs?

[6:20:40] Aquadriel: stairs strat makes her a pinhata
[6:20:41] generaljosh721: @rudric_ice you start attacking the left boss until it reaches 7 stacks and then you switch and repeat

[7:53:11] Masqerader: or so
[7:53:23] Skylin3r: can always do this while queueing for dungeons
[7:53:40] Thoreya: did this on a rogue over the weekend, got to 70 in like 5 hours

[7:53:46] Thoreya: might do boomy/dh
[7:54:05] Skylin3r: yes
[7:54:05] ClassicMalcontent: @Alsparq I don't even pay attention to level (beyond gear for each level think it unlocks +10 gs bump per) but focus on zone unlocks and it goes by before you know it. On all the ones I've levelled. It's "oh look I'm 70 again" when I don't focus on it.
[7:54:08] Skylin3r: miss counts
[7:54:25] Rudric_Ice: holding a button for evoker throws me off lol
[7:54:41] realnzall: I'm not sure this is faster than just questing
[7:54:49] Katattakks: @Rudric_Ice I forget every time lol
[7:54:53] Scoodles91: you clicked the treasure finding thing
[7:54:55] Skylin3r: it is faster
[7:55:01] alantin77: you clicked on the reveal chest button its on dc near your map
[7:55:03] OG_Carroll_4L: I thought I just went colorblind there for a sec scared the shit out of me
[7:55:04] Thoreya: @realnzall it is much faster
[7:55:06] Respls: it's some ability from renown that dies the black and white
[7:55:09] Skylin3r: 1 quest = 9k-10k

[8:01:15] FutileDiploma: @towelliee chat what dps we leveling
[8:01:44] TeeTimeGamer: Had to tune in for DPS leveling title. New year new you!
[8:01:49] Aquadriel: raging outside of fortified is a massive joke
[8:01:49] betray73: betray73 subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 50 months! 
[8:01:50] Pannekaker: Yay, storming is my favourite!
[8:01:54] ClassicMalcontent: Raging? Storming? AND Tyrannical? Just like me. Kappa
[8:02:31] ClassicMalcontent: (j/k I'm just a lovable K a p p a head)
[8:02:39] Masqerader: A joker, a smoker, midnight Evoker
[8:02:42] dmac614: So let’s make both the mobs AND bosses extra hard…..
[8:03:03] ClassicMalcontent: @Masqerader nice... those should be a thing. Hehe for M+
[8:03:04] Aquadriel: just soothe a dangerous mob ez
[8:03:23] heydjzs: do i just suck at mage or are they insanely squishy
[8:03:40] Masqerader: mages are glass cannons
[8:03:56] ClassicMalcontent: @heydjzs squishy not just you go FROST
[8:04:13] ClassicMalcontent: @heydjzs had to switch my mage to Frost to do solo content more easily
[8:04:20] Scarhearth: every dps is a glass cannon except havoc imo
[8:04:34] Cabbageman007: Jade dungeon was AiDs with saguine on that first boss...the walkway
[8:04:35] Q_TheDreamer: I'm also lvling an evoker right now. The damage feels kinda good, but it's not fun getting folded like a lawn chair every two minutes
[8:04:50] bluff1n: mages have a million different ways to escape
[8:04:51] Snabido: Ah, yes. That shield
[8:04:57] heydjzs: yeah im leveling as  frost but pulling more than 1 mob, im fucked lol
[8:04:59] Caedranos: You have to use the mage mobility
[8:05:01] Lostdogal: Warlocks stare in nope.
[8:05:14] Nebulizer87: its missing something
[8:05:19] ClassicMalcontent: For solo at least the control of Frost Mage still plays and feels the best IMHO. For groups do what you can do best but solo Frost still seems best.
[8:05:48] Effin_Steffin: How much Cobalt Rep did the 1 level give?
[8:06:07] dmac614: Dps I kinda nuts if you get a good one
