[1:53:01] EmpathyLiveChat: Any chance of brutosaur appearing or is that a silly question?
[1:53:05] YinYangMan77: Boo
[1:53:12] HaloS23: @Towelliee havent been following what the trading post actually is, is it going to replace the BMAH?
[1:53:13] just_kirk_: Wound not mind the BC Warbear
[1:53:13] jaedfe: My only worry is that you will get tenders cap in one day and then not care for 29 days.
[1:53:14] chippchappi: why not? they gave away feldrake
[1:53:16] xHukk: @EmpathyLiveChat pretty silly prob
[1:53:19] LoremasterMarthan: They would be more likely to add those things to the BMAH for whats not there already
[1:53:22] Bedpan_BoB: @EmpathyLiveChat its in the BMA
[1:53:27] Theduskflyer: This seems like cartel coins. Wish it would just slowly over time add stuff, but not remove it
[1:53:29] beerking2323: NICE MAN!
[1:53:31] EmpathyLiveChat: @EmpathyLiveChat :)
[1:53:39] Rottencoarse: POG he got it
[1:53:44] EmpathyLiveChat: @EmpathyLiveChat Hardly ever
[1:53:44] BobLongMVP: got an email for an on-site playtest at blizzard Irvine. Legit or no?
[1:53:54] EmpathyLiveChat: I mean it's hardly ever in the BMA
[1:53:58] LoremasterMarthan: That being said, I still think they never should have added the Plagued Proto to BMAH. Feels real weird
[1:53:59] beerking2323: they are trying to snake!
[1:54:02] chippchappi: lfr loot is slow sometimes
[1:54:33] Whalechill: milk tauren
[1:54:51] darkdestroz: Justus did hc Raid yesterday and got 4piece, he was a bit tilted cuz he got 421 shoulders that are not tier, so he had to Downgrade ilvl to get 4piece XD
[1:54:53] beerking2323: Towlliee are you doing Raz LFR?
[1:54:54] EdgeOfTwilight: warriors prot set seems underwhelming
[1:54:59] Betrys: @towelliee I came in late. How you feeling after your dentist appointment

[1:55:18] Cheapesttactics1: is blood dk hard to play?
[1:56:07] FragzNTagz: that isnt a streamer thing, thats EVERY group in LFG
[1:56:10] LoremasterMarthan: *raises hand* I would like to hire a streamer to help get my loot
[1:56:48] LoremasterMarthan: I can uh... make mana biscuits.. or a nice dress or something
[1:56:56] AlphasaurusRexx: @Cheapesttactics1 theres a slightly higher skill floor and skill ceiling than other tanks, but it's not "hard" per se
[1:57:21] danemengo: New player here, how’s the alliance/horde balance nowadays?
[1:57:53] Labozer: @danemengo Very different from server to server
[1:57:56] jarilrpg: @danemengo it doesnt really matter, since you can group cross faction
[1:58:06] AlphasaurusRexx: @danemengo depends on the server. Illidan/Mal'ganis is mostly horde and sargeras is mostly alliance
[1:58:09] ItsGigg: Imagine dying LFR KEKW

[2:00:12] jarilrpg: @danemengo only thing that is not is queued things, but premade groups can be cross faction
[2:00:24] AlphasaurusRexx: @danemengo everything is cross faction except guilds and things you can queue for IE bgs, dungeons, lfr

[3:02:12] andre_scb: they overlapped each other
[3:02:14] pyun23: nah its really nothing
[3:02:14] flewid: it was hard to see when you couldn't use one
[3:02:14] Dcarter: Visual change
[3:02:15] OG_Fear: @Towelliee So basically u couldn't tell when ur felguard was going to be done using guillotine
[3:02:15] Poopdollar: Added in necessary overlaps
[3:02:16] ContraRob: they didn't work when used one, but they weren't on cooldown
[3:02:23] OG_Fear: and it was hard to tell when u could use ur cds
[3:02:23] Dcarter: Just so you could see when it’s casti bc
[3:02:25] WizzardMac: Was no timer visually
[3:02:26] Dcarter: Casting
[3:02:32] Galadeon: In vault for locks know how to play all three specs and swap to best spec for each fight.
[3:03:03] OG_Fear: @Towelliee All of these are just adding shadowburn to the talents
[3:03:10] OG_Fear: @Towelliee also no destro is more meta currently tbh.
[3:03:10] Tartxo: Demo 4life <3
[3:03:12] Nokterian: Demo is still the spec to go in m+
[3:03:15] Dcarter: Affliction
[3:03:16] Poopdollar: Nah no demo buffs. Gonna be aff/destro
[3:03:19] Dcarter: Will be best
[3:03:21] exilethegamer: Gotta ask that kalamazi guy
[3:03:22] andre_scb: demon best overall ...destro very good ST
[3:03:23] OG_Fear: In raid that is
[3:03:27] Molvonos: Affliction's so strong
[3:03:28] Bawpears: Affliction might be a better single target spec
[3:03:32] rosina_scarlett: Arms giga buffed FeelsGoodMan FeelsGoodMan FeelsGoodMan
[3:03:32] OG_Fear: AFF will be best ST for sure
[3:03:34] ChainedDice: woooo AFFIE
[3:03:35] OG_Fear: after the new changes
[3:03:42] Sweet_Lou__: I'd rather play a whole new meta class than changing specs, like from Destro Lock
[3:03:43] TacDuc: I miss BfA Affliction
[3:03:53] Grankish: Arms on the rise
[3:03:59] rosina_scarlett: Arms is going to pump even more after 10.05 tbh
[3:04:00] Galadeon: Where the prot warrior buffs?!
[3:04:07] rosina_scarlett: these changes are so nice
[3:04:15] alfdc: arms already on the rise LUL
[3:04:22] TacDuc: Wait, prot got buffed?
[3:04:34] lirly__: @TacDuc good joke
[3:05:06] Kalitvenec: 2020Suspicious
[3:05:23] Rudric_Ice: its only for arms
[3:05:25] Sweet_Lou__: There's nothing for Prot, Only F/A
[3:05:47] rosina_scarlett: immovable object
[3:05:49] TacDuc: @TacDuc I don't like the Malefic rupture we have now, it feels so boring and unsatisfying to use. I liked building stuff up and then using Deathbolt
[3:05:53] kimmo_gaming: make arms great again, enough fury for couple of exps
[3:06:18] TacDuc: @kimmo_gaming Arms is the Go to in PvP
[3:06:21] rosina_scarlett: look at the ptr talents for war
[3:06:45] rosina_scarlett: I'm seeing it
[3:07:20] Snabido: Maybe reverted and wowhead not updating? idk
[3:07:41] tenassity69: they still havent fixed fury set bonus
[3:07:44] rosina_scarlett: no idea but the arms buffs are so Juicy and amazing.

[3:07:54] CrimsonCrusader31: Any changes for my frost DK? I am at work :)
[3:08:00] gritbarontv: kind of
[3:08:06] RocketMan23: @Galadeon luhmao
[3:08:13] Molvonos: Jesus
[3:08:14] iDeez88: we dont use slam anyways
[3:08:20] Foretoldlegends: A Prot warrior that didn't know what they were doing was to squishy.
[3:08:28] RealJudgeAce: @CollinFullmer no DK changes from what i see
[3:08:29] Molvonos: Slam is Maul
[3:08:34] PrimalRain: yeah slam and maul both feel ike shit
[3:08:36] Grankish: Slam is just a rage dump button
[3:08:41] all_the_tanks: heroic strike!!! sunder armor!!
[3:08:44] Snabido: F for Heroic Strike
[3:08:44] Rudric_Ice: people dont even use slam its mortal strike
[3:08:50] RocketMan23: slam also doesnt make sense for anybody but prot warrior
[3:09:04] doublesidecar: Dinosauric I'm grabbing that word, thanks!
[3:09:32] rosina_scarlett: you use dreadnaught in M+ sometimes
[3:09:33] RaptureRiot: I think the visual animations for warriors need some more flare. It makes sense for them not to be to flashy but it does make it seem aged
[3:09:37] Grankish: Fatal mark duration is low key huge
[3:09:44] falstat_: why would you put a bow in the last boss and make mm hunters not have a chance for a mythic run
[3:09:53] Skulligan79: So interrupt clears your bleed wtf?
[3:10:03] AragornPL: is it going to be enough duration for like rasageth fight?
[3:10:10] CrimsonCrusader31: @RaptureRiot Frost DK is just flashing buttons and mini crits everywhere xD
[3:10:20] Grankish: Maybe not raz but probably Kurog
[3:10:25] rosina_scarlett: there trying to make SMF work but it won't
[3:10:35] LynxTheCat: I love that there are 0 DH changes like they're just saying "yeah, we got DH right, everything else sucks"
[3:10:39] iDeez88: 1h weps need 2x str added when equipped
[3:10:52] rosina_scarlett: @Anubyss88 I agree
[3:10:53] Gravy_Gator: I want single minded fury to work
[3:10:58] Molvonos: towDynt towDynt towDynt
[3:11:05] kimmo_gaming: towChad
[3:11:07] Grankish: These fury talents are all ones for the bloodthirst/CSHB build not the one people actually play
[3:11:08] CeruleanStar: i mean i like big pulls
[3:11:09] rosina_scarlett: everyone does but it won't
[3:11:10] TacDuc: As a prot warrior I would say they don't need it
[3:11:13] Sayryn: towHesaidit towDynt
[3:11:23] Rudric_Ice: SMF is a joke idk why blizz keeps pushing for it

[3:11:32] rosina_scarlett: you just lose way to much strength as a fury war using 2 one handers
[3:11:33] CrimsonCrusader31: Could you show frost DK so I can screenshot? @Towelliee I am at work
[3:11:33] Scathell: I'm a shaman ... I feel I've been sent away

[3:14:33] Raxxiety: @Towelliee whats the air duster you use?
[3:14:38] TheNoidd: so they can continue to dr themselves
[3:14:39] TacDuc: People use it in PvP too
[3:14:39] devoted_bee: Do rogues really want extra DR on their stuns?
[3:14:52] darkdestroz: I laugh everytime i see a Tauren rouge,
[3:15:14] Rudric_Ice: they added high mountain when they added tauren rogues

[3:16:49] snake_like: WHERE TOOKA
[3:17:09] zwulf: not sure why crafted gear would be available for catalyst since that gear should get further improvementd with major patches no?
[3:17:12] CeruleanStar: 4pc for all the alts :D
[3:17:17] happybooger: @Towelliee best i could find: https://franklinsports.com/nerf-proshot-foam-baseball-bat
[3:17:21] mcatx2: Yup. Catalyst is way to late. Always like Blizzard to introduce cool stuff late
[3:17:25] TheOldSchoolRyan: Yeah i hate how theyre releasing it i been stuck at 1 piece for ever
[3:17:28] Molvonos: @zwulf Embelishments
[3:17:58] TacDuc: @TheOldSchoolRyan Same, my luck is so shit, got my first drop after like 3 weeks of raiding
[3:18:08] zwulf: wasn't it 15 weeks for catalyst before?
[3:18:15] mcatx2: Blizzard just never learns from their mistakes
[3:18:24] bilboswagginz98: do you know what it will cost to transfer gear to tier?
[3:18:29] Foretoldlegends: There's some big changes about group loot as well if you didn't read that yet Towelliee.

[3:19:06] owdiego: And most of these ppl don't even play wow long enough to even use the catalyst
[3:19:16] sklingel: I quit cause I only did M+ and couldn't get tier
[3:19:17] captain_khyzan: need to revamp raid loot... no upgradable loot and low / few drops feels bad in todays game
[3:19:25] Hammerify: I wish crafted could turn into tier, would greatly boost the public orders requests.
[3:19:25] Twizted23faith: Twizted23faith subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 61 months! 
[3:19:47] beatdooown: or if you aint going to give us catalyst early make primal focus and concentrated primal focus account wide
[3:20:15] doublesidecar: WORD! I dont have a guild so I pug my raids and twice in the last 4 weeks someone who has the tier set piece needs on the gear and takes it when they didnt need it. So I'd really wish I couldve traded in my gear weeks ago.
[3:20:17] happybooger: @Towelliee check my second link
[3:20:36] Cabbageman007: Kelani shows all this on YouTube right now
[3:20:54] Hammerify: I thought the NPC existed but nothing else on the PTR
[3:20:58] mcatx2: WF race was over in the first week. Blizzard just have had the catalyst up within 1-2 weeks after the WF race was over
[3:21:07] warrenny: Is it just me or does tyrhold suck for dragon riding
[3:21:07] mcatx2: should *

[3:22:04] Cabbageman007: Inside the building
[3:22:10] Reckless_Monk: no
[3:22:12] Wugrok: no to your left
[3:22:22] beatdooown: @mcatx2 RWF should have no bearing on catalyst. Those guys run 100s of splits to get tier we shouldnt be prisoners because they want to have 10 alts
[3:22:30] Reckless_Monk: yes
[3:22:36] Reckless_Monk: uo

[3:25:27] mcatx2: @FatMike675 Knowing how Blizzard has setup loot for DF it will take several weeks just to obtain the currency to make 1 piece
[3:25:43] adam6683: Let’s go
[3:25:45] Molvonos: No Mage Tower stuff for Evokers.

[3:27:13] N3llee: CONTENT TO DAMN HIGH
[3:27:15] Thoreya: like what
[3:27:15] Hammerify: "content is coming out too fast" what do you think they were working on when they slept for a year in SL
[3:27:18] SyberRain: but not soon
[3:27:22] Gibsonex937: why can't it be liike shadowlands where we sit for 6 months with nothing to do
[3:27:22] Molvonos: I should pin that post
[3:27:22] EpicJune: please gate my content Kappa

[3:27:28] sliproach: to fast guys still waiting to say yes chef
[3:27:53] Mamma_Nel: This is how it should be, giving all types of players stuff to do throughout the season. PvP probably the most stagnant which is crazy.

[3:30:06] ZeusDNA: KEKW
[3:30:13] Murlock07: lol
[3:30:40] Aquadriel: they should make solo shuffle even worse so pvpers finally leave the game for good Kappa
[3:30:42] NotEnoughMana: uh oh
[3:30:43] Thoreya: good
[3:30:45] Rudric_Ice: they should also do for m+ leavers

[3:31:09] mmmone: do it with m+
[3:31:11] OG_Fear: Some keys in M+ Deserve to be left
[3:31:14] OG_Fear: Id rather not be hostage'd
[3:31:14] Rudric_Ice: why ?
[3:31:17] Gibsonex937: yeah to many people suck
[3:31:18] OG_Fear: in terrible key groups.
[3:31:21] ThePawPaw: @MedicineMan what if you DC-ed doe....internet down....idk
[3:31:22] NotEnoughMana: do it SwiftRage
[3:31:23] xHukk: facts

[3:31:26] mmmone: people are leaving
[3:31:29] Scoodles91: do it in m+ and half of the ppl will get banned :D
[3:31:30] mmmone: non stop
[3:31:31] HoboFighter2: Solo shuffle is queue and its short runtime
[3:31:32] Molvonos: Solo shuffle is entirely random
[3:31:37] Molvonos: M+ isnt
[3:31:40] PrimalRain: they just need to do this for rbg's now
[3:31:41] AdamCbass: i mean you kinda que for M+
[3:31:44] Rudric_Ice: then let us que for M+
[3:31:44] OG_Fear: Leaving keys is healthy enough for me tbh.
[3:31:48] geokouts: please Blizz not so much content! give us less to start whinning!!!
[3:31:48] SauceFu: you should get an IO hit if you leave before the timer expires. After that, free game
[3:31:48] Gibsonex937: i had a group that wiped on first boss 3 times in shadowmoon i was like nope lol

[3:31:55] Snabido: Agency thing
[3:31:55] NotEnoughMana: LUL
[3:31:57] shayneeking: Friends LOL
[3:31:58] xrader858: i agree with u
[3:32:05] homewrecker101: fk friends lol
[3:32:09] Rudric_Ice: QUE US FOR M+ EZ
[3:32:10] kappaday23: Kappa
[3:32:10] MedicineMan: Fair point, @Towelliee
[3:32:14] Goddlin: @Dojittv Lmao. What?
[3:32:17] SteveBaking: give people a leaver score
[3:32:21] vision42g: m+ system is cool dont change it
[3:32:23] gritbarontv: it would if they remove the timer for any below 10+
[3:32:28] TacDuc: The fuck is this thing you are calling "Friends"?
[3:32:30] mcatx2: Blizzard technically has no responsibility because they don't do the invites unlike the solo shuffle that is a 1 up queue
[3:32:33] Gibsonex937: imagine having to do a dungeon for 2 hours because you don't want to be banned lol
[3:32:41] doublesidecar: can you imagine getting into M+ with people refusing to do mechanics and youre forced to finish 90mins + just so you dont get suspended ? xD
[3:32:50] TheCheeseWheel87: report player, deranking key, ignore player, move on
[3:32:50] ZeusDNA: I'd rather have a dude leave in a key that seems not do-able then sit afk holding everyone hostage
[3:32:53] Mamma_Nel: Friends? But everyone I try talking to is a cringe WoW player
[3:32:58] beatdooown: Got i can only imagine how toxic m+ would be with a queue
[3:33:05] BACK_INTO_THE_POOL: @MedicineMan he often has though and I'm not even playin' WoW anymore
[3:33:12] jugshot: im glad im in a place where the power dosent go out
[3:33:22] mcatx2: M + with a queue would be the end of M+
[3:33:37] Rudric_Ice: @beatdooown its already toxic asf it wont change anything
[3:33:55] Thoreya: i think they shud just leave it how it is
[3:34:06] xHukk: @mcatx2 facts
[3:34:18] zwulf: Yeah M+ queing would kill it. But Mythic 0s should be queable at this point
[3:34:50] Rudric_Ice: some L takes in chat
[3:34:52] Metket: @Towelliee i'm unsubbing, not going back until exp like wod where nothing to do. i have fomo Kappa
[3:34:54] mayonaes: I missed the brew review? what is the take will they be strong?
[3:35:04] Spinecloud: if the key is going terrible, and thus a waste of time, whats wrong with leaving? assuming its not advertised as FOR COMPLETION.
[3:35:09] TheOldSchoolRyan: I say make it so key dont go down untill first boss is dead
[3:35:21] Demanisraar: Not a bad change tbh
[3:35:37] Demanisraar: It has
[3:35:39] Hammerify: it has a 12hr cd
[3:35:46] Hammerify: you cant reduce it without unlocking it
[3:35:47] Demanisraar: but you can reduce it in Mastering the Elements
[3:35:48] Scoodles91: it still does
[3:35:54] xrader858: cdr locked behind points i think
[3:35:54] Voidred: if specced into it like you are it stays the same
[3:36:08] dpbdagger: they still aint touching prot warrior??
[3:36:08] xrader858: you do
[3:36:10] Demanisraar: nah you need to spec into it
[3:36:19] Hammerify: it's baseline, put it requires spec for CDR
[3:36:21] Kronicle: Looks like you have to phut the point into it to get the reduction back
[3:36:32] beatdooown: Its amazing how they ain't buffing other tanks but prot warrior still isnt nerfed
[3:36:38] Demanisraar: YES!!
[3:36:41] Demanisraar: Finally
[3:36:52] Demanisraar: yup
[3:36:52] NotEnoughMana: eys LUL
[3:36:54] NotEnoughMana: yes
[3:36:58] Bayne77: YES
[3:37:51] Demanisraar: Man they are improving a lot... very nice to see they are hard at work to make the experience even better

[3:39:05] Reckless_Monk: reflex?
[3:39:06] Demanisraar: I got a RTX whats changed?
[3:39:21] WhiteKnight74648: yeah
[3:39:23] DuhCasual: For me the game is ten fold better than its ever been
[3:39:31] mavericks312: shadowlands had more subs cause of ppll thinking we kill sylvanas
[3:39:32] Scoodles91: SL didnt have that much changes until the end of the expac
[3:39:36] ravennl: Shadowlands also came during Corona...different time tbh
[3:39:37] CrusaderNero: DF is fucking great
[3:39:37] shayneeking: People are actually working, during shadowlands people had to change to working from home
[3:39:54] 1wex_1: best expac since legion atm tbh
[3:40:07] deterdetz456: Towelliee aint wrong lol
[3:40:15] WundertueteGER: Hope the next engine feature will be DirectStorage for much faster loading times
[3:40:18] mavericks312: dragonflight is so fucking good man
[3:40:18] FatGoatHieru: Probably easier to churn out new stuff in dragonflight when they don't have to spend time on random ass borrowed power of cov, leggo's etc, which is good.
[3:40:46] Demanisraar: Damn nice!
[3:40:48] Sylphy_TV: Ful screen plese :o
[3:40:57] flebbooo: PogChamp leets go
[3:41:04] warrenny: Input latency?
[3:41:07] beatdooown: @FatGoatHieru not to mention all there other games currently suck. OW2 is terrible no other game is getting content
[3:41:15] rbolude: i play with 150 ms i wonder how much is gonna change
[3:41:22] Demanisraar: That is going to matter a lot
[3:41:43] FranciscoTheMage: i was half listening. but have to know @Towelliee how do you know how many subsriberrs there were to SL versus DF
[3:41:46] 1wex_1: I wonder if this input latency stuff is them prepping to put wow on the Xbox cloud gaming thing
[3:41:49] GivTater: I just buy card I don't know what does. givtaterDerp
[3:41:59] andre_scb: latency from hardware not internet GUYS
[3:42:14] rbolude: its still related
[3:42:39] FranciscoTheMage: I agree in SL there clearly were disagreements about what to do next in the expac .. ie pulling the ripcord. HERE in DF the team is clearly unified in how to move forward
[3:42:47] andre_scb: kinda but not huge on internet side
[3:42:49] host_255: this tech is proven to be negligible
[3:43:13] Demanisraar: Will deffo try it out to see it does something
[3:43:37] ACrispyCookie: yeah but reflex really only helps the most when you can maintain max fps for your monitor
[3:43:52] Rudric_Ice: it prolly wont do anything

[3:44:16] Demanisraar: @ACrispyCookie Does G-Sync matter in that? If you know :)
[3:44:19] flebbooo: we love to see it
[3:44:24] OG_Fear: They've done a great job
[3:44:27] PewpewJukeu: where's the latency settings?
[3:44:33] OG_Fear: except for the injustice they have done to resto shamans
[3:44:33] SilkeySmooth: they didnt listen to hunter feed back about bouble tap so....
[3:44:39] OG_Fear: Poor resto shamans Lol
[3:44:42] deterdetz456: your eating the food that MY food eats lol
[3:44:48] D3m0nHunt3r666: awesome
[3:44:48] beatdooown: Yet prot warrior is still not changed and if you're pushing high m+ or mythic raid you're forced to have one
[3:44:51] Bayne77: rabbits eat yogurt?
[3:44:57] abracka_: quick diet hacks
[3:44:57] FranciscoTheMage: what tooth thing.. did you have a pulled tooth

[3:45:22] xghostyyx: Nick Offerman
[3:45:34] mavericks312: molars

[3:45:36] Zolare: molars
[3:45:39] deterdetz456: they can put siicone in teeth,,,,lol jk
[3:45:44] DhioGaming: shit im missing 20 teeth
[3:45:54] fractalcrescendo: Has anyone noticed the broken scaling for leveling dungeon gear on the PTR? It's like are all unscaled yet still squished.

[3:47:13] 3dobbee: its 40 dungeons now coz of crafted gear just for the 418 gear

[3:47:27] fractalcrescendo: @CrusaderNero What I mean is, like TBC dungeon gear all requires level 27 regardless of what level it dropped at.

[4:41:08] dpbdagger: just dwarf racial the bleed Kappa
[4:41:21] ThePhildozer89: It can depend on the tanks skill level. A good tank with a proper rotation will almost always rip from a DK doing the same.

[4:44:51] adam6683: I was joking when the priest died. Should of slappy hands that shit lol
[4:45:02] ThePhildozer89: DK just does less damage then all the other tanks.
[4:45:03] nextalcupfan: Paladin Brez also has no CD, its charge based. I think 1 every 10 min

[4:55:08] ZeusDNA: I believe that mob is a rare which may be why it didn't work
[4:55:11] Molvonos: Has to be elite, has to die while you're channeling it.
[4:55:13] TacDuc: Those work
[4:55:13] ZeusDNA: Or event mob at the least
[4:55:14] Voltaictv: These do count
[4:55:14] thebakeriscomingforu: those should work
[4:55:15] gold9871: those count
[4:55:16] Frostfury: You have to use it before the mob is dead so timing it well is awkward
[4:55:18] Aegllor: elite elementals
[4:55:18] big__chief__: big__chief__ subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 4 months! 
[4:55:19] Khooya_: @Towelliee you have to catch it while it dies
[4:55:25] rampage1526: this count
[4:55:27] Molvonos: So you start channeling it and hope your dots kill it
[4:55:48] rampage1526: nope
[4:55:52] gold9871: nope
[4:55:55] Lifeles85: mathilKEKW

[4:55:58] TacDuc: It is so annoying that they do that
[4:55:59] gold9871: cc if needed
[4:56:05] ZeusDNA: I think having someone party with you to kill it while you channel is easiest method
[4:56:05] rampage1526: nope ahha
[4:56:07] GilianoGVK: u can solo, ditch the pet
[4:56:09] Khooya_: preferably yes
[4:56:09] Frostfury: Just hold
[4:56:12] rampage1526: use breath
[4:56:20] Voltaictv: It deals dmg, but you do need to get them really low, like 20k health
[4:56:23] TacDuc: The explosive blast is the disorient
[4:56:27] rampage1526: lucky hahaa
[4:56:30] Lifeles85: LuL
[4:56:38] rampage1526: water

[4:56:42] TacDuc: The frost one is right by there
[4:56:44] TheDos13: raid trash is the easiest way to get some
[4:57:00] spidersrskary: just tuned in whats the point of all this?
[4:57:04] Brodih_: damn Alec Baldwin was accused for that accident with the gun last year
[4:57:10] TacDuc: You can go to the water around the brackenhide WQ area
[4:57:46] Aegllor: theres aslo a chance of not getting the soul and getting a pet instead.
[4:57:47] Von_Liechtenstein: How do you do the random transmog?
[4:57:57] rnh_silky: Towellliee, why can i not get invited to +16's on a 2k io brewmaster with a 2.3k io main
[4:58:09] LoremasterMarthan: Yea they are charging him with manslaughter for it
[4:58:16] c0mmander_starscream: Brother going to Riker's Island
[4:58:16] Katattakks: he could get I think 5 years for involuntary manslaughter
[4:58:16] JohnStocktonsShorts: Involuntary manslaughter is the charge I think
[4:58:16] xghostyyx: No hes getting involuntary manslaughter chgarges brought up
[4:58:17] nicknacking5: manslaughter
[4:58:17] cmitchell042092: Involuntary manslaughter
[4:58:19] ripperofbong420: i think the conversation is more around incompetence
[4:58:19] Jarlan23: invoulntary mandslaughter
[4:58:23] Jarlan23: is what the charge is
[4:58:24] CousinAvi86: involuntary manslaughter I think, which still results in jail time
[4:58:28] xghostyyx: 18 month max sentence
[4:58:30] c0mmander_starscream: I hope he knows how to make a "shiv"
[4:58:31] Sollice: He hasnt gone to trial yet friends....he isnt guilty yet
[4:58:32] Khooya_: @Aegllor only if you don't wait the 15 mins
[4:58:37] Zoldrek: Zoldrek subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 31 months! 
[4:58:46] DarthWrex: Involuntary Manslaughter is the worst he can get.
[4:58:46] Sollice: @Towelliee Basically yes
[4:58:56] DarthWrex: Yes that @towelliee
[4:58:56] falldrgn: its the "master at arms" or whatever its called.
[4:58:58] ripperofbong420: yea and they dont want you fucking with it at all except for the actual shot
[4:59:00] Brodih_: yep the prop techniciens
[4:59:00] Katattakks: yeah- it's a fucked up situation. It's not his fault, but HE'S the one who fired it.
[4:59:05] Sollice: Thats what a prop master and specfically a gunsmith on set does
[4:59:06] WaverlyP15: shouldn't that be on the armorer though, that shouldn't be the actors responsibilty
[4:59:08] xghostyyx: Yea but prosecutors can still go after him for involuntary negligence resulting in a death
[4:59:13] Jarlan23: i heard he was a producer on the movie
[4:59:15] Jarlan23: so thats why
[4:59:16] xizidor: They must have that in their contract
[4:59:21] xghostyyx: Light prison time but a conviction none the less
[4:59:24] c0mmander_starscream: It was a fucked up set, they weren't following the rules
[4:59:27] homewrecker101: the armorer has been charged also
[4:59:30] Bayne77: contracts dont negate law.
[4:59:37] Sollice: @c0mmander_starscream I think thats the crux of the issue your right
[4:59:38] Quojin: Treat every gun as if its loaded with live rounds
[4:59:51] cmitchell042092: He’s just been charged. Not sure if he’s been tried and found guilty
[5:00:00] Brodih_: the guy is a legend, hopefully his career wont end like this
[5:00:04] raldrik: they are saying the full set didnt follow the proper gun safety and he was part of that.
[5:00:04] Sollice: He hasnt been tried yet just charged like you said
[5:00:05] hammack52: its not really about wither he checked it or not it was the lack of gun safty priactices, you know the fact that he pointed a gun at someone weather he thogut it was loaded or not
[5:00:09] falldrgn: unless it contains a zero liablility clause..
[5:00:11] LoremasterMarthan: He was charged for being the person improperly firing, and the armorer was charged for there actually being a loaded weapon without proper preperation/safety/knowledge
[5:00:12] WaverlyP15: thats not negligence,, that should be the armorers' MAA's responsibilty. hence why they hire them
[5:00:15] c0mmander_starscream: RIP his trophy wife, she's going to have to a job now.
[5:00:22] Bedpan_BoB: @cmitchell042092 guilty in a twitch chat court of law
[5:00:39] Quojin: @hammack52 exactly
[5:01:16] WaverlyP15: with the producer argument though, why hire a subject matter expert, if it still falls on the producer

[5:01:27] abracka_: actual manslaughter  i think
[5:01:28] falldrgn: Negligence. normally
[5:01:34] firehawk73: involuntary manslaughter
[5:01:34] alundrius: negligence most likely
[5:01:40] Sollice: No
[5:01:41] cmitchell042092: She should be punished as well. It was her job to ensure the gun was not loaded
[5:01:42] LoremasterMarthan: Negligence on the Armorer's partr
[5:01:47] Sollice: Isnt the one who actually got killed the MAA?
[5:01:52] Sollice: Or was it the director
[5:02:05] firehawk73: both him and the person that loaded the gun got popped with involutary manslaughter
[5:02:10] Aegllor: possibly more than that
[5:02:22] WaverlyP15: definitely negligence on the MAA's part, not the opther way around
[5:02:25] Aegllor: watch it be a pet that you loot instead of the soul
[5:02:27] abracka_: no, the armorer is getting involuntary too, my bad
[5:02:29] falldrgn: didn't a blank malfunction and kill her? Same with Brandon lee?
[5:02:40] Sollice: ok so the director was the one who got killed. the MAA is also being killed
[5:02:41] cmitchell042092: @sollice Pretty sure the one killed was the director
[5:02:55] PvtHudson093: bring back mission table for runes
[5:03:16] cta62: @Towelliee hi chat I hope u are all doing great today i sadly sharfted myself but besides that I am doing great and hope u all are as well and glad to hear ur teethies are doing good towel man
[5:03:25] WaverlyP15: @falldrgn from my understanding, it was loaded with a real round by the MAA or MAA's staff even though they all should have been blanks
[5:03:31] Strange_Inquiries: That spider is a pain in the dick in LFR LUL People are so dumb
[5:03:55] Throkkz: The hardest part will be for them to prove negligence for manslaughter to stick.

[5:20:43] zuluhawk: He one shot that WB*
[5:20:47] Khooya_: north*
[5:20:51] Teknofear64: Can't get 1 stack of determination on Raszageth LFR

[5:23:31] R3b1rth_: i usually stay around for a few try if a see improvement, if i see none i just leave
[5:23:45] Nerdmeat_: I was laughing my ass off at that game
[5:23:50] LowKeyGaming: in a sense i would much rather have them make us do the split of groups and people go to their side. Just putting you at the correct side would make no one learn. i dont know
[5:23:52] mozart69_420: will you raid ulduar
[5:23:53] TheGiant99: I did it 3 times and it was dead in 3 to 4 pulls
[5:23:56] coldarmorTBG: For fights like that, I agree with you. I think they should do away with the LFR gear level and just make normal mode able to be qued.

[5:28:07] Nokterian: @Towelliee in china there is no Nike but Ekin LUL
[5:28:21] dankosaurusx: there's closed beta gameplay videos online for Tarisland

[5:28:41] Nerdmeat_: Our Intellectual Property, Comrade
[5:28:43] enux337: so china could make a reskinned starcraft wow version
[5:28:50] Arch0ntas777: so they will call Rexxar as Rixxar and copy @Towelliee ?

[5:28:58] snake_like: Devil Man 5
[5:29:00] TheGiant99: call it Lost Ark lol
[5:29:05] wEiRdO_dUdE: "Tencent has yet to announce a release date for Tarisland, but the company has stated that the game will be available on both PC and mobile platforms."

[5:30:35] wEiRdO_dUdE: A little strange that another company got WoW working on mobile first, but there it is
[5:30:36] kokochris: @Sayryn holy shit almost forgot about that scene.. classic
[5:30:48] pereadin: I can craft it i think T
[5:30:52] Stoops21: 405 is 5
[5:30:55] Stoops21: 402 is 4
[5:30:55] GingerGambit: 5
[5:30:59] Ryvden: rank 5 405
[5:30:59] pereadin: Not sure if rank 5 or not but I def have the pattern
[5:31:04] Ckraigfriend: 5
[5:31:04] GingerGambit: Rank 4 is 402
[5:31:06] Mecabeast: r4 because r5 is only inspiration
[5:31:17] adam6683: This is why I don’t craft 😂
[5:31:19] Gitmm: 405
[5:31:34] Katattakks: Greg Roman resigned from the Ravens
[5:32:08] Eshel: Ugh - can’t resubscribe with prime ……..
[5:32:15] rnh_silky: someone remote login and make towelliee his goddamn belt
[5:32:17] Shahin200x: @Towelliee Dont look let them just type and they will whisper u
[5:32:35] pk99: gonna be 50K bro EZ Price
[5:32:45] caffeinatedaustin: sup @Towelliee
[5:33:09] pereadin: Always rank 2
[5:33:15] barrowzz: always all R3 materials
[5:33:21] Mecabeast: prob r2 if you had original crafted with r3
[5:33:28] tawney_owl_: why would rank 2 be better than 3
[5:33:30] rampage1526: all r1
[5:33:31] Shahin200x: with Alloy R2 its 43% i think
[5:33:37] j_hooligan: I just send the order  and wait a lil bit and if they don’t fill move on to the next one
[5:33:42] pereadin: Maybe first craft you want 3 but recrafts always rank 2
[5:33:49] WhiteKnight74648: how?
[5:33:51] tawney_owl_: why tho
[5:34:02] Eshel: Man - fuck ads
[5:34:05] WaverlyP15: and skill, theres a guy on Zul that i use that can make R5 with r3
[5:34:12] pereadin: Let me log on and check if I can guarantee rank 4/5
[5:34:30] WaverlyP15: made my shield 405 with r2 mats
[5:34:31] Moobot:  Check out Towelliee's YouTube channel! You can view the most recent uploaded video HERE || Huge Mythic Dungeon NERFS?! - WoW News youtu.be/E5e_yQcTBQw
[5:34:53] WhiteKnight74648: that doesn't make sense though. higher quality mats should yield better results or i would think that
[5:35:13] NotEnoughMana: probably do a LF and let them whisper you, you can ask price and pick the lower one?
[5:35:28] Ckraigfriend: yes trade chat
[5:35:51] Luxembourger: Noch ein Deutscher hier?
[5:36:16] WaverlyP15: r3 is like 1200 on zul jin, but 2 is still signifcantly cheaper
[5:36:29] neverbornlucky: looks like they flushed our water system. Becareful if you live in Garland Texas we had brown water last night
[5:36:42] A_Klimas: @WhiteKnight74648 there isn't enough skill in the game currently to guarantee r5 for some patterns + Embellishment combos so its better to just go for r4 and hope for inspiration procs
[5:37:00] Phisheys: phisheys subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 8 months! 
[5:37:01] neverbornlucky: having to drink bottle water today to be safe
[5:37:09] nocturnal_2195: @Luxembourger Nein
[5:37:30] WaverlyP15: good god  why are those so expensive on your server
[5:37:41] WhiteKnight74648: @A_Klimas that makes sense
[5:37:53] wEiRdO_dUdE: There's a chance that the Jaguars beat the Chiefs, too LUL
[5:38:07] Demvacco: higher ranks of mats only give more skill so if the crafter has high skill it comes down to the inspiration proc.  any decent crafter at this point has high enough skill to use lower level mats and still get the inspiration proc for r5
[5:38:09] Shahin200x: put 12 hours for less fees
[5:38:27] g0n_z3n: Have to add alloys
[5:38:33] NotEnoughMana: LUL
[5:38:37] snake_like: kind of crazy how racial profession buffs affect r3 chances by kind a shit ton in some cases
[5:38:40] WaverlyP15: @wEiRdO_dUdE Lol, however they had 5 turnovers and still won, so that would be a great weekend
[5:38:42] Ckraigfriend: you got the wrong alloy
[5:38:56] Snabido: You're just flipping the AH, thats all Kappa
[5:39:21] Shahin200x: @Towelliee they go cheaper by the day if u not crafting wep now sell them
[5:39:30] GilianoGVK: bro i can make that to

[5:40:41] wEiRdO_dUdE: 405 is alright
[5:40:44] tawney_owl_: gawd damn
[5:40:45] Derca_: Clap
[5:40:50] Mecabeast: @notenoughmana you have to send more mats
