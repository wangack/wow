[1:06:44] PadidinJones: The Smolderon kill was funny AF though

[1:09:51] Eshel: thats what i'm trying to say... error on the side of overtuning than undertuning like youre currently doing... its not like Blizz doesn't know what these guys can and will do
[1:10:39] rbgdev: How many phases are there?
[1:11:33] rbgdev: Yea I agree, they should make the raid and leave it alone unless there’s bugs
[1:11:57] rbgdev: I feel like them changing things live IS catering to the race, which shouldn’t be there deal
[1:12:10] Sadisticmedic: Love you logic @Towelliee
[1:12:39] xrandomdoodx: The random heroic Fyrakk buffs even felt weird, like..why? haha
[1:12:58] Folgrum: blizz can just make mythic raid start at same time for all regions. too bad they still didnt. maintance can be different
[1:13:25] Rygothx: Was the mythic raid available back in PTR? If so, Blizz would have some data to tell them if they're easy or hard something like that so they can buff or nerf them in LIVE then?

[2:23:50] andreasprr: Like no combat at all
[2:24:13] Folgrum: MMo is bad to watch but nice to play :)
[2:24:15] akia03: he wants to punch the boss himself
[2:24:16] Eshel: go see your doctor about head injuries
[2:24:21] cipusanx: maybe he wants jrpg combat where u spin  10 time sin the air and you cut 100 times
[2:24:22] src1923: 10 year old got loose on pc
[2:24:34] EpicJune: they're probably more used to action combat than tab targeting
[2:24:43] SaltywankeR: imagine watching streamer wtaching other people play, its a neverending repeating tunnel
[2:24:45] Dixa1: i hope you aren't insinuating action combat mmorpgs are better. no other mmorpg type uses bullshit one-shot mechanics as a 'balance' tool as action based mmorpgs.
[2:24:46] SaltywankeR: |;D

[3:37:22] neftario105: I like Survival Hunter they are so cool my dudes
[3:38:08] neftario105: Whit there bombs 💣
[3:38:43] Glodwran468: Is Rune Tap still a thing?
[3:38:51] Noshpan: @SaiyanKent Naoki Yoshida is director for FF 14 & 16.
[3:39:39] SaiyanKent: @Noshpan Yes I am aware of that, he has been for as long as I can remember, how does that make the content worse?

[3:42:06] wEiRdO_dUdE: Vampire tanks
[3:42:16] Glodwran468: I think that DK just suffers from the fundamental flaw of the idea of a tank that heals themselves for a major part of their defense, while healers are already a part of the game, and the fights aren't about attrition. When your tank can pingpong health from 100% to 40% and back again in like 2 globals, the ideas just won't parse together.
[3:43:01] jamarky23: its cause yoshi also worked on ff 16
[3:43:10] metavahn231: and 16 did pretty mediocre
[3:43:10] Nokterian: mostly because of covid
[3:43:36] Nokterian: and ffxiv had no new servers during covid when endwalker was released
[3:44:03] jamarky23: ff 7 remake is a million times better imo
[3:44:03] Noshpan: The was also a shortage of materials needed to make new servers
[3:44:14] Xetter: What about D4?
[3:44:16] Pharaoh_326: BG3 is amazing.
[3:44:17] Gremaldy: BG3 for me
[3:44:18] metavahn231: wow classic plus goty Kappa
[3:44:26] SaiyanKent: Which they had no control over with new servers
[3:44:36] neftario105: FF7 back in the day was amazing
[3:44:49] Glodwran468: I have a hard time judging 16's hype when it came out. I mostly get my news from watching Twitch, and JRPGs that are story heave just don't do super well on Twitch.
[3:45:11] metavahn231: the demo had more hype
[3:45:15] Nokterian: BG3 is not everyone cup of tea towSip
[3:45:48] Nokterian: BG3 will get all the awards LUL
[3:46:20] Noshpan: As much as I would love Tears of the Kingdom to win GotY, it definitely should go to BG3
[3:46:28] Glodwran468: Crazy how well a game can do when your studio puts love and care into it, and listens to community input from early access.
[3:46:41] Nokterian: i never played d&d
[3:46:44] metavahn231: bg2 was real time with pause and it was more fun to me
[3:46:44] Glornius: PixelBob PixelBob <3 <3
[3:46:57] Glornius: LUL
[3:47:03] metavahn231: the turn based crap gets kind aold
[3:47:17] Glornius: I bet! lol
[3:47:18] metavahn231: turn based only good in FF
[3:47:21] neftario105: @towelliee u like BG3?
[3:47:30] wEiRdO_dUdE: Turn based is way different
[3:47:33] cynicalrapture: never played dnd before till bg3 and now I'm going weekly to dnd meet ups and playing. @Towelliee
[3:48:00] idenkaz_: crono trigger was it right?
[3:48:10] jamarky23: its supposed to be a really good remaster
[3:48:13] jamarky23: remake*
[3:48:14] Clay2K_: @Towelliee whats A jrpg?
[3:48:16] Noshpan: I personally like turn based games. If I have to get up & go to the bathroom on my turn, I can without worry that the game will continue playing.
[3:48:32] Glodwran468: I love turn based. Being able to take your time to really strategize and examine the battlefield, enemies, and your own capabilities is just my speed. It's just hard to find the balance in turn based games to make them neither too hard, nor too easy
[3:48:32] neftario105: I play a lot of Zelda an Final Fantasy Games when I was young
[3:48:44] floppenn: @Clay2K_ Japanese rpg
[3:48:59] Eviltuna13: Skies of Arcadia for the Dreamcast was amazing
[3:49:19] metavahn231: XG is the ultimate classic rpg

[3:49:24] Glodwran468: Skies of Arcadia was fucking GOATed.
[3:49:46] YakkDeity: lost and forgotten Legends of dragoon
[3:49:48] Noshpan: Yeah, Star Ocean 5 was awful
[3:49:48] cynicalrapture: @Clay2K_  jrpg is a Japanese role-playing game
[3:50:08] futomara01: what else would it be called

[3:50:10] Glodwran468: Star Ocean doesn't know what a proper difficulty curve looks like.

[4:06:35] Dkgungo: that boss is gonna go down as one of the worst in wow history
[4:06:52] Nebulizer87: i had the best day of loot from M+ yesterday, got both my trinkets and shield
[4:06:53] king_julian_96: do you think either liquid or echo will have mythic tindral killed by next reset
[4:06:56] Pharaoh_326: i loved that flight boss.  it was fun
[4:07:01] nevercluckyy: pretty sure this one is worse than halondrus unless they can figure out some kind of major optimization so they arent going into final phase with over 60%
[4:07:04] king_julian_96: or do you think will take them longer
[4:07:16] szrak10: probs get nerfed after both liquid and echo kill boss
[4:07:36] idenkaz_: that might be a 600 pull boss
[4:08:41] nevercluckyy: did they fix the memory leak issues every 3 hours that liquid dealt with all night?

[4:14:31] Moobot: No need to repeat yourself, @king_julian_96 (warning)
[4:14:38] wEiRdO_dUdE: That bug definitely stopped Liquid for quite awhile
[4:15:01] Syprus1: Liquid vs Echo i think are tied in RWF's
[4:15:18] Effin_Steffin: Smolderon kill was nut with just the 2 tanks left.
[4:15:45] SpoofAvatar: Echo is good at copying strats
[4:16:57] Zorthul_: Did Method/Echo ever asked for a global release to help asian guild compete in the RWF when they (Method/Echo) were winning every RFW?
[4:16:57] Marcinek_xP: healer probably has to change their pants now
[4:17:10] Zorthul_: asian guilds*
[4:17:36] SpoofAvatar: @Zorthul_ LUL, not in a million years
[4:17:55] nevercluckyy: ive watched both teams for years and could care less about the eu vs na thing i have just always leaned more towards liquid because they arent overly serious grumpy old men 99% of the time like echo
[4:18:17] nevercluckyy: they actually try to enjoy the game instead of dignifying themselves
[4:18:23] Mozzeyy_: @nevercluckyy lol
[4:18:52] king_julian_96: have there been any previous RWF bosses that have taken over 200 pulls to kill
[4:19:03] Keyastaron_: Life Cocoon healing increased by 33%. Soothing Mist healing increased by 40%. Enveloping Mist healing increased by 25%. Misty Peaks Icon Misty Peaks chance to trigger reduced to 2.5/5% (was 5/10%).  Enveloping Breath now heals up to 5 nearby targets (was 6). Invigorating Mists’s healing is increased by 25%. Invigorating Mists’s healing is now reduced beyond 5 targets.
[4:19:07] Keyastaron_: 10 .2 changes
[4:19:09] Keyastaron_: for MW monk
[4:19:44] Keyastaron_: why is sanguine on the healing meters? LUL

[7:37:08] Snabido: A lot of wow tokens exchanged Keepo
[7:37:16] TheGiant99: What % of p[layers do you think actuall watch or care about the race
[7:37:25] Tozzoo: you also see the casters for echo more...liquid enjoyers seem to watch max more than the main cast
[7:37:26] theDirtyon3: they ahve the night show still
[7:37:31] Larc9783: Its shrinkflation
[7:37:37] akia03: they have morning and night show dont they

[7:39:50] akia03: @theDirtyon3 is there a rep buff aswel?
