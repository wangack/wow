[6:20:55] NotASkiller: Kermit: hey Bean, I think it'd be really cool if you shouted out the user in chat who has donated a charitable amount of gold. It would be a small incentive to give you gold. Unless of course, there's something you're not telling us about how you're getting so much gold.

[6:26:50] LiquidmattertheNatural: patrick: why is my fart so loud? answer: Loud flatus – this is caused by the muscles of the bowel forcing air through the tight ring of muscle at the anus. Suggestions include passing the air with less power, and reducing the amount of intestinal gas by making dietary adjustments.

[8:40:58] LiquidmattertheNatural: patrick: why is my fart so loud? answer: Loud flatus – this is caused by the muscles of the bowel forcing air through the tight ring of muscle at the anus. Suggestions include passing the air with less power, and reducing the amount of intestinal gas by making dietary adjustments.
