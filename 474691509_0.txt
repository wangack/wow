[1:15:42] Gnocchi10: @mdicompslol the main problem for bfa imo is class progression. They kinda fixed it now with the heart abilities but at the start you had azerite gear and thats it. So you had nothing really new so it was really unsatisfying.

[4:02:02] Sleepypan: why not go watch something you do like
[4:02:04] Gwyndalion: @FranciscoTHEmage If retail wasn't dead they wouldn't be casting Roleplaying skills in a Dungeon.
