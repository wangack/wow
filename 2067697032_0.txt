[1:48:00] JMaC727: i gave greggedup his staff from galakrdon
[1:48:29] zachl_: @cucumbertoessniffa 33 is possible but requires a 32 atal to be timed and roll into brh
[1:48:51] zachl_: which is, very hard
[1:49:04] zachl_: and unlikely
[1:49:45] DerJungeErSelbst: is atal 33 not doable?

[2:01:19] zachl_: if you meld with efflo down and other people are in combat- in efflo, it won’t give you combat
[2:01:32] baseboned: why did they remove inspiring because not being able to use cc is bad, but then add new raging
[2:02:06] Shadostealer: @baseboned because raging is funnier when you use a global on cc and its immune
[2:02:30] njokkio: @baseboned probably same reason the removed explosive because healer affixes are bad and then added afflicted

[3:00:13] BigTrout3: WIDEHUHH
[3:00:13] ConchubarOD: I was gonna say that if you were mod in 1 and vip in the other, the "inline" mod commands on one chat and not the other in chatterino would annoy me
[3:00:15] zolal3: HUHH
[3:00:31] BigTrout3: high key 2 liter water bottles make drinking enough water EZ
[3:00:55] zachl_: @ConchubarOD i could totally see that but nah not mod, offered to mod for high viewer streams for them to not be total cancer but
[3:00:59] zachl_: i like the pink diamond ore

[3:05:52] epilepticunicorn_: this pull looks good
[3:05:52] Tinch85: is chirping rune any good?
[3:06:13] IAttackYou: it’s all ogre soon
[3:06:15] MierkaBlue: can you get to 20 deaths before the pull is over?
[3:06:21] Tinch85: @yumytv what rune do you use?
[3:06:25] TripleXTN: only lost 3mins, keep it going, good pace
[3:06:26] tvilk: he uses haste
[3:06:29] Tinch85: ty
[3:06:29] tvilk: he just said
[3:06:34] SFGranis: Hello Pet wcsLing
[3:06:51] yctnm: catJAM
[3:06:52] Nightbot: catJAM
[3:07:01] Gongstream: growl has spent more time in dear form than human form this key
[3:07:09] YANYOoo: spot doesn't work that way, mobs need to be on other side of the torch
[3:07:18] YANYOoo: so they can't see ur feet
[3:07:33] Izkatu: this ad looks like my pug
[3:07:36] IAmSolari: @YANYOoo ? SNIFFA
[3:07:57] tvilk: xdd
[3:08:29] TripleXTN: looks like my pugs, going well
[3:08:38] tvilk: weekly no leaver
[3:10:15] tvilk: holy.. impreggedup got low there
[3:11:52] Cyberz_: what trinkets are you using
[3:12:21] tvilk: im guessing sea star and some other nonusable
[3:12:46] Cyberz_: not running any damage trinkets? like people are using fyrakks tank trinket but idk when to press it
[3:12:53] Urdian: how do you get 3 regrowths out that fast when your not hard casting?
[3:12:58] zolal3: Aware yumy ret
[3:13:10] TripleXTN: bro i hate healers. "healing is too hard this season." growl is jumping up and down missing a jump spot over and over and timing a 29
[3:13:13] zachl_: @Urdian talent, regrowths casts on lifebloomed targets at reduced rate
[3:13:26] Ajatus: twicks Deadge
[3:13:31] Urdian: @Urdian do you know the name of the talent?
[3:13:41] zachl_: rampant growth
[3:13:48] Urdian: tyvm luv you
[3:13:55] Cyberz_: when do people press fyrakktanktrinket? as defensive or offensive?
[3:14:03] Ajatus: @zachl_ i dont think the dot is reduce you just dont cleave the up front heal
[3:14:06] Ajatus: hot*
[3:14:12] zachl_: @Cyberz_ defensive 100%  of the time the absorb is rediculous
[3:14:13] tvilk: @TripleXTN tbf you can't compare growls group to a normal group that never uses stops and defensives
[3:14:30] zachl_: @Ajatus good points B)
[3:14:37] 253templar: @TripleXTN insane take
[3:14:45] Cyberz_: ive got 12 fyrakk kills hc and didnt roll higher then 35 on it
[3:14:59] Basic_3: Conveniently, the game is exactly as hard as you want it to be. That's how scaling works.
[3:15:04] d34dlyd0g: Healing generally have a lot of variance in how much healing is needed. In one group, things will look easy. The next group, it'll feel impossible.
[3:15:06] epilepticunicorn_: also looking at one pull that doesnt need healing unless guys are jumping and saying thats representative of healing
[3:15:20] zachl_: ^
[3:15:33] TripleXTN: that was a good one
[3:15:35] zachl_: go heal a 8 minute iridickron on 28 tyran and tell me healing isnt hard
[3:15:37] Basic_3: Also, VDH is broken and healing any key without one is a big difference.
[3:16:28] tvilk: zach your job is easy.. i healed a +5 EB the other day on my 485 druid it was a piece of cake stop complaining
[3:16:35] D_GolDeN: !rio
[3:16:37] zolal3: @Basic_3 vdh fort weeks, pala tyran weeks
[3:16:49] zachl_: ya rdruid has it hard on +5's
[3:16:57] trench_toaster: my disc priest is mainly playing as shadow now, pretty sweet
[3:17:13] Basic_3: Incoming 3 more changes to Mind Link before the inevitable redesign.
[3:17:35] ReSeT_VT: blizz doesn't know what to do with dot classes Sadge
[3:17:44] ReSeT_VT: is that right tvilk
[3:18:00] Ajatus: my dad got a new car which means i got his old car. easy finesse boys. were moving up in the world EZ
[3:18:18] tvilk: i dont think its the dot classes that are designed wrong, i think its the content in the game thats not designed around dot classes
[3:18:24] zachl_: healing this boss as druid with grievous OMEGALUL
[3:18:27] zachl_: everyones dead
[3:18:34] internetuser97: @Ajatus rise & grind brother EZ

[3:21:10] tvilk: mdi was hype
[3:21:12] tvilk: this weekend
[3:21:51] ReSeT_VT: @tvilk that is true and based
[3:21:51] BigTrout3: xddPeat
[3:22:37] tvilk: @ReSeT_VT My whole point earlier was just that if you're an affliction fan you can definitely play it at a comfortable level without being gimped out of your mind.. but yeah if you care about rating and pushing you dont play aff obviously
[3:22:46] tvilk: same reason you dont play Frost dk
[3:22:59] Dironmonk: xyronic BASEG
[3:23:03] Basic_3: Aff has lots of problems
[3:23:10] BigTrout3: sad ass rogue noises LOST
[3:23:19] Basic_3: Siphon Life is still in the game, so it's clear nobody designing the game cares.
[3:23:21] Whitewolf1441: i feel like bosses shouldnt have more than 3 mechanics
[3:23:48] tvilk: aff got some great positive changes this tier, but yeah its still not super great
[3:23:52] Niroggo: COPIUM
[3:24:11] BrOwLee23: so fast kill
[3:24:16] BrOwLee23: wtf
[3:24:23] tvilk: @ReSeT_VT also why are you in every chat that i am in Susge

[3:24:51] tvilk: kek
[3:24:55] Whitewolf1441: @ReSeT_VT elaborate
[3:24:56] TripleXTN: @ReSeT_VT I was thinking that too
[3:24:57] ReSeT_VT: from a twitch chat perspective
[3:25:03] tvilk: arent you also in scripes chat
[3:25:04] Aandromega: Is THIS the zero to hero series?!
[3:25:14] ReSeT_VT: again, same person
[3:25:17] tvilk: xdd
[3:25:21] ReSeT_VT: wow gameplay people
[3:25:21] BigTrout3: i can agree with the mind sear take if only because i hate not having Shadowcrash to get good psychic link damage
[3:25:32] Whitewolf1441: so everyone who streams the same game is the same person?
[3:25:44] tvilk: all im learning is that i need to find new people to watch
[3:25:49] tvilk: im starting to see a pattern
[3:25:54] roguerhino: wait chat what is going on with BM?
[3:25:57] Whitewolf1441: its ok to have a type
[3:26:00] ReSeT_VT: no, but people streaming the same type of content (competitive PvE) will have common chatters
[3:26:24] Basic_3: Dark Soul is a boring button though. Who cares?
[3:26:25] tvilk: i watch meeres growl and scripe primarily for their personality tbh
[3:26:32] tvilk: just so happens they're happy when they stream wow m+
[3:26:35] Whitewolf1441: yeah i care about the streamer personality tbh
[3:27:00] TripleXTN: yeah i care about junkrat's personality, that's why i watch him
[3:27:05] x_ANiMa: elden ring is a banger
[3:27:12] tvilk: i mean i dont generally.. but if im gonna watch a residentsleeper wow stream it has to be with a good streamer KEKW
[3:27:35] ReSeT_VT: wow gameplay is kinda lacking so the streamer has to be entertaining
[3:27:42] tvilk: yeah exactly
[3:27:49] tvilk: and also zach is here sometimes and he's nice
[3:28:07] ReSeT_VT: and if you dislike the screamer streamers theres like only a handful I feel like
[3:28:19] zachl_: wow gameplay is lacking until you have to copy someone globally perfect
[3:28:24] zachl_: then ur like wtf
[3:28:32] zachl_: until u hit that point- ye gameplay kinda lackin
[3:28:38] ReSeT_VT: imagine playing wow
[3:28:49] tvilk: @ReSeT_VT hmm idk.. i would say there are plenty to choose from, but it depends what you describe as screamer ofc.. like would you say Squeex is screamer? Or Pokelawls?
[3:29:19] ReSeT_VT: I haven't watched enough of them, just seen them in collabs. I think they aren't
[3:29:22] kingslayertvn: guys 483 iridal or 489 reg weapon?
[3:29:25] kingslayertvn: on disc priest
[3:29:47] kingslayertvn: ty man
[3:29:51] tvilk: @ReSeT_VT yeah me neither, so if you dont say those are i would say there's plenty to choose from.. but idk depends if you like that kind of content too ofc
