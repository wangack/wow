[3:45:02] hang_fire: But of course they’re all worried
[3:45:05] JAYYRROD: I’ve heard that breathing exercises are good with COVID (or at least deep breaths). To make sure that oxygen and blood flow are all good
[3:45:06] gritz_n_pitz: as long as there arent serious respiratory troubles i wouldnt stress too much @jakenbakeLIVE

[3:45:29] chone33: It has to start with us
[3:45:32] Havra295: yeah aus is pretty good with it
[3:45:35] creamyslate: @jakenbakeLIVE you saw the antimask mall raid in ca?
[3:45:36] ooplu: A true lockdown is virtually impossible
[3:45:40] NamariHane: we have almost no cases
[3:45:41] vodloser: yep in home for 4 months
[3:45:42] dankNstein_: body fatigue, loss of smell/taste, a fever that spikes up and down randomly are symptoms my aunt had when she got it
[3:45:44] lovelyzsj: Are they still not able to taste?
[3:45:49] Lunatrix: australia had a fucking in person musicla festival not too long ago, thats how good theyre doing @jakenbakeLIVE
[3:45:50] Reefermane_710: My pops had Covid and recovered, his past he's had 2 brain surgeries
[3:45:50] Miyako_panda: I'm just getting over COVID now, I didn't get achy but my mom did.
[3:45:50] Patrick_Batemann__: i had it beat it in like 16 hours lol
[3:45:51] OkNext: Doing well because they locked whole cities down, endorsed very hard

[3:46:14] Guiltyfreegaming: Grab your dad a case of Essentia water with electrolytes + probiotics to stay hydrated and treat his gut if no appetite and not eating. But he should eat something nutritional.
[3:46:17] Mallow610: I can’t watch that stuff anymore. It makes me so upset
[3:46:23] JAYYRROD: Why is the anti mask thing the hill these people wanna die on. Seems like such a common sense thing
[3:46:27] hang_fire: For 8 months we didn’t know a single person with it, now every day someone close says they have it. Suddenly exploded.
[3:46:27] Teriinistylez: nz has only 60 cases all in managed isolations
[3:46:34] ooplu: Australia is water locked and most of its mass is isolated in two to three places, easier to maintain
[3:46:38] GiantDuckKing: I strongly suspect we'll learn later that Covid19 affects your nervous symptom. We're seeing a lot of brain, back (spine), leg (heaviest cluster of nerves outside of brain and spine) issues. Would add to taste and smell.
[3:46:42] drummervibes: So many countries are Fucked especially the U.S.

[3:47:07] Lunatrix: these people need to go volunteer in hospitals right now if they think its not a big deal.
[3:47:11] Kermitigated: its a terrible place
[3:47:12] xzamas: TRUMPERS ARE INBREDS TBH
[3:47:15] mr_No: buy your dad and oxygen METER. it goes on your finger and measures the % of oxygen in the blood
[3:47:17] Lunatrix: so they can really see.

[3:47:38] dankNstein_: what tilted me the most were those assholes going into hospitals filming the first floor lobby with no one in it saying hospitals weren't full and it's all fake news
[3:47:38] GiantDuckKing: My mind was blown by Japan, immediately felt like the US was suddenly behind. From both the UK and USA, still feel they're so much better built.
[3:47:38] holeyroller: @COMA70S3 Evidence leaning to be a vascular disease in some ways, too.
[3:47:41] samn6: I always knew 80% of humanity including me is stupid
[3:47:48] hirengames: we're not good on money either LUL. we're all in debt
[3:47:48] Lunatrix: America has turned into a pure cpitalistic machine. Money > People.
[3:47:53] skoal_e: the fire was just an illusion
[3:47:54] DROXoctopus: SmogHard7
[3:47:54] ooplu: Not true jake

[3:48:30] Columbus_LoL: no one outside the US thinks the US is the best country in the world anymore
[3:48:31] ooplu: The problem we are facing is an Individuals freedom, which people are using out of context
[3:48:32] NamariHane: earth country when?
[3:48:36] gritz_n_pitz: and then a pandemic hit and want to go out FailFish

[3:49:15] xEddyv: !covidupdate2

[3:49:30] vodloser: FeelsBadMan
[3:49:39] mushiwushi: kinda like rdming for content KKonaW
[3:49:49] ooplu: It’s sickening that people value there own freedoms over the health or betterment of the rest of us
[3:49:55] JAYYRROD: Jake’s immune system: jnbSubs
[3:49:58] gritz_n_pitz: The thing i dont understand is how some people have these views and get Covid then double down on the Shit

[3:50:21] onlytypesezclap: get an antibodies test done
[3:50:25] creamyslate: my dad thought for sure he had covid. he didnt go to the doctor because he didnt have a cough and he thought breathing was the worst issue. turns out he had sepsis and almost died.
[3:50:25] braadleeyy: the american experiment, and any liberal style of governance in general, exists only on the backs of the authority of the liberal institutions it props up. these liberal institutions are responsible for establishing a common set of truths that we all grapple with and struggle with as a society. once you have one governing party throwing those institutions under the bus, like the republicans, things go so far off the rails that it becomes unsalvageable
[3:50:26] GiantDuckKing: I think, truly unfortunately, think a lot of the people pushing back on masks and covid really have nothing better to do with how jobs are.
[3:50:27] culture__vulture: !covidupdate2

[3:51:04] SandalKoe17: 102.6
[3:51:07] nazu44: scared me dude
[3:51:09] Chris18y: Trump had a cocktail of steroids and high edged medication easy for him to say COVID is not a big deal
[3:51:10] FCLiver: Yea only 2 of us got it everybody else in my household didn’t get any symptoms
[3:51:11] mydadworksatTwitch: my brother had 2 weeks of tight chest/difficulty breathing and body aches back in april
[3:51:12] JAYYRROD: Do you think we got a first pass of the virus in early Jan - Feb? I seem to remember a ton of people being really sick
[3:51:12] braadleeyy: because many people can feel like they're fine with breathing but have very low oxygen levels

[3:52:08] Lunatrix: you said your area is scary right now? @jakenbakeLIVE
[3:52:10] GiantDuckKing: @jakenbakeLIVE 103 is close to hospital talk brother. At least make sure he's handling the fever properly (tylonol & sheets NOT heavy blanket)
[3:52:13] BadgerV2: @jakenbakeLIVE hi jake hru
[3:52:13] gochu_papi: You probably know this but incase you dont: Vitamin D, Zinc, NAC, and Quercitin. All relatively harmless supplements that may possibly help your father fight the virus. Ask your doctor for verification. Hope your family recovers soon man. @jakenbakeLIVE
[3:52:14] CallMeDoubleYou: @gritz_n_pitz literally. I think 103 is ER asap
[3:52:14] ikillwchopstick: jake just built different
[3:52:16] Heliosblade: I was sick in the beginning of last year it wasn't covid it ppl confusing with the flu
[3:52:20] Chris18y: LA COVID CAPITAL
[3:52:24] Reefermane_710: Yeah it’s really bad
[3:52:25] Ree_Spec: the UK is really really bad right now too

[3:52:25] ooplu: BibleThump BibleThump
[3:52:29] Mallow610: That’s how NYC was in April. It was scary
[3:52:30] braadleeyy: EMTs have been told to not perform CPR right now on cardiac arrest patients, which is totally abnormal
[3:52:32] Lunatrix: thats so fucking scary.
[3:52:33] Tekly1: yo
[3:52:34] Rogerdodger1021: @jakenbakeLIVE LA isnt even taking in people that had a heart attack
[3:52:34] onlytypesezclap: LA is the most dangerous place in the world
[3:52:35] braadleeyy: they have called in the army corps
[3:52:40] taketimebekind: Thanksgiving aftermath
[3:52:43] bullseyebill27: My cousin was in a tent in the AV Hospital parking lot in Palmdale

[3:52:54] Kermitigated: WTF
[3:52:56] Lunatrix: can i ask tho, why is california getting fucked so hard ??? @jakenbakeLIVE genuine question.
[3:52:56] Mallow610: Cuz we don’t have a president
[3:52:57] Rogerdodger1021: ROSC
[3:52:57] GiantDuckKing: Not wrong, no idea why LA is not being treated like NYC. It's exactly the same now.
[3:52:57] ooplu: It’s impossible BibleThump
[3:52:59] SVPV: they sent a huge hospital ship to NY earlier in the year right? Should send it around to LA
[3:53:00] Reefermane_710: Sadge America is lacking right now because mr maga

[3:53:22] Toledoss: Make sure that your dad takes in a lot of fluids with that kind high fever. Even if hes not eating that much.
[3:53:26] mr_No: army cant shoot the virus...
[3:53:27] bethfig: that’s crazyy
[3:53:27] andrew5513: we currently have a shit president and just elected another shot president
[3:53:29] creamyslate: its crazy that its getting so bad NOW. it feels like we're so close to the finish line with the vac
[3:53:29] babyfacex0: don't you remember what happened last time the military was called. People got upset and protested
[3:53:31] pokebalI: we need stricter lockdowns
[3:53:31] gangsta0095: yeah f for the old people Sadge
[3:53:33] drummervibes: Man I remember when NYC was the corona hotspot, was a scary time for me
[3:53:34] Chris18y: Its no that bad here in BC but there's a lot of people who dont wear mask here.
[3:53:35] Azurith: Only gonna get worse too
[3:53:43] Lunatrix: the army can set up pop up hospitals.
[3:53:44] Mallow610: We could’ve prevented the whole thing cuz the same exact thing happened in NYC already
[3:53:52] culture__vulture: Vegas just had a huge influx of tourists for New Years. Shit is probably gonna go down here
[3:53:53] Heliosblade: Trump gave up and push it to the states with lack of money and just trying to steal a election
[3:53:55] ooplu: It’s the same reason we still have food suffrage with enough food to feed the world.
[3:53:56] avocadoandpineapplephobia: jaaaakeeee
[3:53:57] GiantDuckKing: @jakenbakeLIVE apparently army corps of engineers was called to help oxygen systems.
[3:53:58] yamajiie: are you listening to a playlist?
[3:53:59] junconscious: Sadge
[3:54:00] skypierce: but muh freeedumbbbs
[3:54:03] trEv_1: they can turn you away in ambulance
[3:54:04] Guiltyfreegaming: In hindsight, US has been going downhill. Still remember how it was talked about US students were lagging behind other developing countries? That was being talked about like a decade or more ago. Just a lot of coping nowadays, US lost its way.
[3:54:04] Reefermane_710: No it has happened already @jakenbakelive
[3:54:04] Ree_Spec: @hang_fire yeah man its nuts, people dont seem to realise our hospitals are pretty much at capacity
[3:54:05] onlytypesezclap: I would be so scared to be in LA right now
[3:54:07] Lunatrix: chat why is cali getting screwed with covid rn? why clai?
[3:54:08] Prometheus_alGhul: that's the hospitals fault they had several months to get ready they predicted that it would get worse around this time and no action was taken
[3:54:10] Miyako_panda: My neighbor just died from COVID today. She never leaves the house so it's scary to think her family probably killed her.
[3:54:11] vodloser: i feel so bad, so many bad stories, and yet the government has done nothing to prevent this. If there was a month lockdown you could reduce the spread heaps
[3:54:13] creamyslate: my dad had sepsis and didnt go to the hospital until he was almost dead
[3:54:15] braadleeyy: yeah, LA did call the army recently
[3:54:15] trEv_1: but they cant turn you away if you camn get there an walk up
[3:54:17] Jazz0123: in Kaiser hospital in san jose a lot the staff got infected and some passed away
[3:54:20] QuinnDarko: uni100 I live in LA too, and can confirm there were military medical officers at Cedar Sinai helping.

Pretty much everyone in their town got covid from a man who flew to mexico city from nyc and then rode a coach bus to the rural area. Funeral cars up and down the road everyday during july-august. Only severe case in my family was my grandfather. Grandmother who had breast cancer and double mastectomy was asymptomatic. It is nightmare lottery.

[4:12:48] Kermitigated: how about "the cozy end times 🥰 "
[4:12:48] bearacudadruid: I got some sort of Pneumonia when I came back home (Minnesota) from Hawaii in August 2019, I was sick for a month and a half to recover. That's 5-6 months BEFORE the covid thing. I kinda believe that things are different from what the news tells us. My Grandma and Cousin have been sick with that the doctors call Pneumonia also... So, what teh F?
[4:12:57] InXanee: gritz_n_pitz wow and jake is showing no symptoms, thats nice to hear
[4:13:02] Dj_Bobby_G: Fever can be good for fighting it off

[4:13:33] ooplu: @dj_bobby_g Not 100% true, fever is an indicator of over acting immune receptors
[4:13:35] Mallow610: I’ve watched a ton of experience vids on YouTube and a lot have symptoms for a few days...seem to go away and then come back
[4:13:37] Guiltyfreegaming: Whatever Water and Tim is going should double down with your dad, if you find a way to persuade him.

[4:13:57] GiantDuckKing: @jakenbakeLIVE make sure when you check in that he's getting enough water. It's easy for fevers to return with poor hydration. Doctors also try to reduce fevers asap. Use sheets, not heavy blankets. Look this stuff up too, don't take my word for it.

[4:23:27] gritz_n_pitz: @g_a_l_v_a need more than what the sun provides
[4:23:31] OkNext: FYI - Your body can't make vitamin D if you're sitting indoors by a sunny window because ultraviolet B (UVB) rays (the ones your body needs to make vitamin D) can't get through the glass.
[4:23:31] gerypunk: go outside
[4:23:32] Vagorge: the good thing is its only a fever and not breathing problems @jakenbakeLIVE

[4:24:26] Guiltyfreegaming: Home security camera with shared access with you sounds like a good plan. Not bad idea too for elderly parents. Good suggestion IMO.
[4:24:26] frostedshaikhs: especially when you have shortness of breath at night thats terrifying
[4:24:27] FrontalDinamo: I think a camera is too much, get him one of those ''I've fallen and i cant get up buttons''
[4:24:27] gritz_n_pitz: yes just keep an eye on that
