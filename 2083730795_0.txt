[0:27:02] NeeK_23: The Revendreth WQ was finally up but it was the wrong version...So mad
[0:27:14] NeeK_23: yeah
[0:27:19] MediumRareOG: in my comp stomps top damage is like 15M and it's always a warrior
[0:27:45] dramallama85: is it feasible, or it's completely insane, to complete all covenants on one character? I'm talking storylines, achievements, collections, etc.? what's the most efficient way to do it? I haven't tried anything else other than night fae
[0:28:01] MediumRareOG: 8M is good. i top out at like 6M
[0:28:03] Jack_the_Dipper: App update
[0:28:06] NeeK_23: the AI usually clump together so I go Affliction and just spawn camp them for huge damage
[0:28:18] NeeK_23: @dramallama85 I've done it
[0:28:27] Jack_the_Dipper: @MrGM App update incoming for Twitch
[0:29:14] Jack_the_Dipper: But a lots of things
[0:29:26] Jack_the_Dipper: It's good and some bad
[0:29:29] dramallama85: @NeeK_23 you basically do one covenant at a time, complete it, and move to another? or you mix and match activities? I'm too overwhelmed with all the stuff, cause I've missed most of SL
[0:29:30] RosieSeren: Good afternoon Mr Gm hope your day is going well
[0:29:31] Jack_the_Dipper: like the price increases
[0:29:36] Jack_the_Dipper: yeah
[0:29:54] Jack_the_Dipper: But finally an app update since 2019
[0:29:59] databob1: The subs going up?
[0:30:04] Jack_the_Dipper: yeah major
[0:30:42] NeeK_23: @dramallama85 I did it during SL so each patch I was a different cov. but now you can swap instantly and you can move anima stored in one cov to another via the vendor next to the oribos flightmaster.
[0:31:17] StreamElements: dracJAM TWITCH PRIME dracJAM
[0:31:25] NeeK_23: a real challenge in SL yeah
[0:31:28] blumberquack: IIRC it was super broken back then LUL

[0:32:29] NeeK_23: think 10% cut
[0:32:31] Neostigma: Pretty shitty XD
[0:32:40] RosieSeren: yeah they is usually a 'store fee' if its through an app
[0:32:47] Neostigma: Getting sacked sooner or later :s
[0:33:00] dramallama85: @NeeK_23 thanks a lot, I'm asking here, cause I haven't found any good guide regarding this :)

[0:34:05] physalis4: Yes, yesterday was the first day everyone felt back to normal. Kids finally went back to school
[0:34:36] Jack_the_Dipper: @Neostigma Yeah that sucks, but shit always creates new opportunities. I hope you wfind something new soon
[0:34:52] Neostigma: I haven't followed any news in past 2 weeks due to chaos at work, any news on alpha yeh /

[0:42:59] Faeynna: "Shadowlands Beta Access"
[0:43:03] Faeynna: But now it's gone.
[0:43:09] BananaBaby29: maybe video game adjacent because if blizzard stop developing wow your job goes too
[0:43:12] Dopefishy: Question: if WoW was announced to end (servers go down etc) what would you do? switch to another game?
[0:43:16] Faeynna: Ah okay
[0:43:29] Thovii: shadowlands beta? surely that expansion is going to be great Kappa
[0:43:34] physalis4: you can do what you do and not play games
[0:43:34] Welsy_: LMAO
[0:43:50] Welsy_: would you wrestle yourself or just commentate
[0:43:58] Lausten: I would quit videogames if wow shut down
[0:44:00] Faeynna: If that fails, you go into pro wrestling yourself. :D
[0:44:03] BananaBaby29: 2k24 wwe pro streamer

[0:46:50] physalis4: I'm not big into wrestling anymore, but that hit close to home. I was a huge fan of Sting when I was younger
[0:46:55] Lausten: Actually not done it myself
[0:47:35] physalis4: My poor younger brother was put in many scorpion death locks
[0:48:28] Lausten: Guess its custom color, let me see if I can change it to default purple
[0:48:48] Lausten: Better?
[0:49:32] Lausten: I think its Turbo custom color, I just picked a purple
[0:50:00] Lausten: But I've heard it before so changed it to the default blue violet now
[0:50:29] physalis4: How long did it take you to get all of that?
[0:50:57] MediumRareOG: everything about comp stomp feels good. quick queues, quick game, kinda fun to smash AIs
[0:51:34] Lausten: Unlock the buildings, then dive into it or it will feel frustrating having to come back
[0:51:41] RAF_Sean: Big fan of comp stomp
[0:51:44] AdamShwaginz: i love comp stomp
[0:51:57] MediumRareOG: i bought the unrated pvp set and that actually made a huge difference
[0:51:58] AdamShwaginz: I wish a lot of things were up all the time in retail
[0:53:22] Jack_the_Dipper: 'Christian Horner's accuser 'suspended' after Red Bull's investigation into Formula One boss'
[0:53:40] Lausten: @AdamShwaginz That would sadly result in the playerbase being spread more thin than it already is in this lul period.. A good indication of that is how few custom groups there is, half the groups are 2x4 groups..
[0:53:45] Jack_the_Dipper: I wonder why kaatHmm
[0:54:23] Lausten: Not as Miki
[0:54:32] Lausten: Mikanikos?

[1:02:58] AdamShwaginz: you're not in the minority btw
[1:03:16] Lausten: @NeeK_23 Its goat for collecting!
[1:03:17] AdamShwaginz: everyone that wants new models in classic are retail andies
[1:03:17] Coldberg13: It would not fit
[1:03:18] fooxytv: true
[1:03:41] Chelidda: Cata isn't classic anyway, so it's par for the course
[1:03:41] keyboardturner: doesn't this mentality just go to show how outdated the old world is in need of a revamp
[1:03:47] physalis4: you need to have some ascetic that separates it from retail.
[1:04:27] lumaday: Do we think WotLK characters will be moved to Cata realms on release?
[1:04:32] physalis4: *aesthetic
[1:04:33] CTdoesGames: o/
[1:04:34] AdamShwaginz: retail graphics have gotten to a point where it's too far removed from the original aesthetic of wow and I have a hard time connecting to retail because of it
[1:04:54] AdamShwaginz: PepeHands
[1:05:20] Rexy95: might just be me but i dont see the "big" diff
[1:05:39] AdamShwaginz: it's either that or the themes of the expansions I can't put my finger on it
[1:06:03] AdamShwaginz: 100% agree
[1:06:04] Lausten: I just see more pixels not a big change in aesthetics
[1:06:08] fooxytv: I'm not a fan of the newer animations

[1:08:31] NeeK_23: Ember Court
[1:08:31] MediumRareOG: i actually hate vehicle mini games where i can't use any of my gear/abilities so i didn't do this one when it was live
[1:08:39] KaisenSiru: It was harder when it was current, but there were some fights that had to be cheesed to defeat, like the spider one
[1:08:40] ImperfectDark: i never did any of them til i did Path of Ascension recently for the mogs. I liked it because it was easy but would have been annoying if i did it during release lol
[1:08:46] Coldberg13: ember court was best
[1:08:50] dramallama85: is the ember court the counterpart of, let's say, the queen's conservatory?
[1:09:08] MediumRareOG: i always heard people complaining about ember court. i inever did it
[1:09:10] physalis4: You could get really good at the Ember Court if you knew what you were doing
[1:09:15] MediumRareOG: i only did the night fae one
[1:09:22] ImperfectDark: there's one achievement i couldn't do here because i was too high level. "all the colors of the painbow" or something
[1:09:23] KaisenSiru: I did enjoy Ember Court the most though, and did it for all 4 armor types weekly when SL was current
[1:09:56] Lausten: I did them all, maxxed all covenants on my main..
[1:10:12] Lausten: At the back there is a buff
[1:10:15] Lausten: Disable it
[1:11:28] Lausten: Rewards are weekly I believe
[1:11:35] KaisenSiru: You can do it daily now yep
[1:11:45] Lausten: Or bots would farm it
[1:11:57] Layliah79: I enjoyed the ember court. I did it x4 (armor types) back in SL before it was changed to daily Dx
[1:12:11] physalis4: I got all 4 mounts from the Ember Court. It took FOREVER. Almost the whole expansion

[1:12:56] KaisenSiru: Yeah, there is one mount only from one guest that you need to have max rep with to get from the chest (The one Lady)
[1:13:24] KaisenSiru: for Court
[1:13:56] physalis4: mrgmHehe mrgmHehe mrgmHehe
[1:14:16] Sery_Bot: The ad break is finishing now! seryboLove
[1:14:21] skewlbeta: Not related, but my husband and I made new characters and leveled with a solo or duo dungeon challenge mode. So we are just running into dungeons with the 2 of us and trying to solo them. We are RPing as we run between them and it's been  real fun if people are looking for something different to do.
[1:14:31] Lausten: Its actually wild how much stuff was put in to these covenants
[1:15:09] ImperfectDark: i'm almost 60 on my mechagnome so definitely gonna try the follower dungeons and see how it goes
[1:15:11] skewlbeta: It allows us to slow down in the dungeons and get creative with pulls too
[1:15:23] skewlbeta: It's a very "classic" way to play retail I guess.
[1:15:43] skewlbeta: Yeah, he is playing a shaman and the heals are very needed.
[1:16:37] Lisa5233: why again?
[1:16:53] Lisa5233: banned
[1:17:00] fooxytv: that's a really cool idea @skewlbeta
[1:17:11] Lisa5233: or did I hear that wrong, yup I did hear it wrong lol sry
[1:17:53] Lisa5233: lol its mine also but I just heard you wrong sorry was at a boss also  :)
[1:18:08] Neostigma: Yeh some of the achivements are actually harder due to the one shots you do XD
[1:18:08] Greatmatt1: I have no interest in cata at all
[1:18:10] RosieSeren: I already suffered playing cata at the time
[1:18:19] fooxytv: only to check the backend for addons :D
[1:18:27] funviking99: cata is meh
[1:18:35] funviking99: mop would be nicer
[1:18:41] skewlbeta: What's the cadence of classic like? Are they going to run out of expacs at some point?
[1:18:49] RosieSeren: for me, the idea of 'classic' ends at wrath
[1:18:52] fooxytv: I didn't like it when it was released first time
[1:18:53] Nydaend: hello @MrGM
[1:18:56] ImperfectDark: no interest in classic for me. I only started at Shadowlands BUT i do like questing in the older expansions (with my current expansion characters), lol
[1:19:08] Nydaend: good , how are u
[1:19:08] Arlaeya: I played the heck out of it at the time and will give it a go for a bit
[1:19:10] funviking99: we getting legion classic? mrgmToast
[1:19:12] Xesol: they will just make season based content in classic expansions like SoD
[1:19:36] ImperfectDark: my WoW life began in the Afterlife
[1:19:39] SinicalDev: id much rather have 'trilogy' progression servers personally
[1:19:44] KaisenSiru: Cata Pog
[1:19:51] Rokir_: Its me. Im the one man that wants Cataclysm
[1:19:51] KaisenSiru: I would play Cata over Wrath
[1:19:53] Rokir_: I solo funded it
[1:20:02] Rexy95: i hope they dont eventually cave in to those who want characters to merge to retail, would make me mad i didnt clear naxx on my warrior LUL
[1:20:05] Rokir_: IM 24 DAN
[1:20:06] Rokir_: RUDE
[1:20:08] fooxytv: LuL
[1:20:11] physalis4: haha
[1:20:16] Greatmatt1: I wanted classic to be able to go back to the old world before Cata changed everything.
[1:20:34] lumaday: Cata is when i started playing more seriously
[1:20:37] Arlaeya: I mean we're still playing in the cata world in retail so... I dunno.
[1:20:39] fooxytv: yep I thought that was the point too
[1:21:03] Greatmatt1: After Cata, can we get classic classic? LUL
[1:21:19] SinicalDev: I think once Omar the God made the translation tech for older game data they found it easy to make classic versions of each expansion - its probably a stop gap until sod becomes a full-fat game branch
[1:21:29] Neostigma: Well I mean thousand needles isnt the same XD
[1:21:57] lumaday: Surprised they are gonna leave wrath servers since things change so much going into Cata
[1:22:04] lumaday: arent*
[1:22:06] Neostigma: Sorry I misunderstood, I through you meant pre cata
[1:22:12] Izzy_Yeeto: do u have the 500 moutn achievement?
[1:23:12] funviking99: so capital cities havenâ€™t been updated since cata? that sucks

[1:25:40] Izzy_Yeeto: i found a another guy with like 90 subs on youtube who has been making excellent videos of very high quality collecting stuff
[1:26:19] skewlbeta: inb4 during the war within people talk about how cool the covenants were as a concept and the clear aesthetic between them was a good thing.

[1:27:17] Neostigma: You need to get stacks yeh
[1:27:29] keyboardturner: need to be proper level for it
[1:27:31] ImperfectDark: i think it's the fiery veins you can't do
[1:27:35] ImperfectDark: but definitely one of them lol
[1:27:58] Lausten: Wonder if it can be done with party sync?
[1:28:07] Lausten: Scale down to 60
[1:28:52] Layliah79: That was a lot of fun!!! Still need to finish collecting 2 of the armor types in it.
[1:28:57] Izzy_Yeeto: whats been the worst expansion to try to 100%? my journey to 100% has basically jsut begun.
[1:29:09] Layliah79: SL lol
[1:29:33] ImperfectDark: i THINK he only consumes when injured
[1:29:54] Izzy_Yeeto: i figure alot of the newer stuff is a quantiy problem, but the older stuff is just wierd problems. like zone drops that only drop from a rare mob at a 1% chance or something
[1:30:31] Lausten: You're correct Izzy
[1:30:31] NeeK_23: 2 orbs, not twive

[1:35:41] Neostigma: Lol
[1:35:47] ImperfectDark: lol he got me with that one before. I was stunned
[1:35:49] Tweex4You: ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚
[1:36:02] Neostigma: Lucky you dont get a repair biill Xd
[1:38:09] kasfade: it was 6?
[1:38:32] maros_petrus: but you did 6
[1:38:32] NeeK_23: one of the equipments is a shield I think
[1:38:42] Neostigma: you have to survive it says, so must be hit ?
[1:39:43] kasfade: if it doesnt hit it doesnt count
[1:39:55] NeeK_23: place your back to a pillar?
[1:39:56] blumberquack: I believe you need to be hit
[1:40:02] blumberquack: from what I remember doing the achieve
[1:40:05] ImperfectDark: that makes sense. it says survive not avoid
[1:40:11] Lausten: Yeah get knocked into a pillar I guess
[1:40:34] blumberquack: yea, this one's more of a puzzle
[1:40:40] Rexy95: stand with your back so you cant block or parry i guess :D
[1:43:29] luckfore: love the insta comp stomp queues
[1:43:45] kasfade: ur level 70 prob why?
[1:43:54] lumaday: @luckfore a nice change of pace from the solo shuffle queues lol
[1:45:21] ImperfectDark: the memories were those blue pelagos figures. you walk into them
[1:46:24] dimofodi: I think there's one of these that require you to get a DoT on you that I kept resisting. :(
[1:47:39] Tankersss: isn't it only on wisdom?
[1:47:42] dimofodi: I think he set off a bolt that hit her before it died on last one
[1:48:03] LuiBMHunter: heh heh
[1:48:10] Lausten: Nah, you're not stupid, there is just a loooooot of information to keep track of

[1:54:56] skewlbeta: I was here
[1:55:55] Westtell401: How do you download it before  they  start the beta i don't understand... have they provided you with a beta download because ur a partnered streamer or something ?
[1:56:14] Tankersss: isn't he behind the covenant bounds thingie ?
[1:56:17] Lausten: So many vendors
[1:57:13] Tankersss: isn't it like 500k for all or smthn?
[1:57:30] skewlbeta: So we are thinking 3/19 or 3/26 for 10.2.6? I think people are a bit over the hype at the moment which is unfortunate.
[1:57:38] Sinrath: its more like 1.2 Mio
[1:58:35] skewlbeta: Surely they'll give us a day or 2 notice, I imagine?
[2:00:21] Lausten: I feel like post today and access friday
[2:00:51] SlithTheSivak: ive built up what i want in my head so much im bound to be dissappointed
[2:00:52] Lausten: I feel like it was how they did it last time there was a beta
[2:00:53] Rexy95: i love the 10.2.6 not being on ptr or datamined but a date atleast would be lovely :)
[2:01:17] StreamElements: dracJAM TWITCH PRIME dracJAM
[2:01:37] skewlbeta: I'm going to be disappointed if it's not in fact something pirate related
[2:01:42] jayjayw54: any guesses to what it would be?
[2:01:47] SlithTheSivak: sky pirates
[2:01:49] Westtell401: they pushed the build but there will need to be internal testing on the build prior to letting people in  make sure its at least stable
[2:01:55] Lisa5233: no idea
[2:01:56] Lausten: @SlithTheSivak Thats the problem with announcing these things and teasing so muc..
[2:02:26] jayjayw54: not like its new content ;P
[2:02:45] SlithTheSivak: basically: island expeditions but w flying skyships, we raid settlements, sometimes other skyships fight us. Dynamic flight is basically required to leave the ship. PvP is possible...
[2:02:46] Lausten: Rare in cave below

[2:08:16] Sery_Bot: The ad break is finishing now! seryboLove
[2:08:20] jayjayw54: was very very hard to get back into the game i tell ya what but i love the game too much

[2:09:40] sUb2_w9nDeR: ðŸ¦Ž
[2:09:48] jayjayw54: thats the thing i had 2 factor and shit so basically they claimed that i gave it out which i never had and let the person from america on my account when i live in aus
[2:09:49] jayjayw54: but yeah
[2:09:52] jayjayw54: horiid HAHAH
[2:10:00] Lausten: Gotta troll a bit more, dont you have phones? For autheticator?
[2:10:49] jayjayw54: youd think so - but than lately seeing the stuff people are getting banned for in SOD like default pet names and shit i am really not suprised
[2:10:51] Lausten: Your accunt gets auto blocked if you login from another region than the one you're in, had several guildies over the years who worked abroad who needed to have them flag their account to be allowed to login from other regions
[2:11:00] jayjayw54: half the time you dont even hear from a real person anymore
[2:11:45] jayjayw54: haha
[2:11:46] Lausten: The pet name was people reporting it, and those are auto bans
[2:12:05] Lausten: Asmongold tested it, he got banned for a message instantly
[2:12:26] Tankersss: I had been mass reported as I was sniping ores on a big server in SoD
[2:12:26] Lausten: Cause the persons "community" gotta be full of shitheads
[2:12:45] Lausten: It takes a lot of reports
[2:13:06] jayjayw54: yea guildie got 14 day for pvping in barrens phase 1
[2:13:19] Lausten: People did that in trade chat at the start of the expansion
[2:13:34] Lausten: To remove competiton
[2:13:56] keyboardturner: I pretty much never trust anyone who gets banned for "no reason" or doing "innocent" activities
[2:14:00] jayjayw54: if u anger a guild its a scary place in SOD they just mass report u and u get ban HAHAH
[2:14:01] jayjayw54: fun times
[2:14:20] Lausten: There gotta be someone checking waht you got banned for, and by the time a GM gets arround to checkiing the ban you're probably aready unbanned
[2:14:42] jayjayw54: yeah exactly sometimes you really do get banned for nothing lately
[2:14:51] Lausten: I think they go up in time, wouldnt know though, never had any trouble with that
[2:14:55] jayjayw54: 7 - 14 days i think
[2:14:59] physalis4: I hate when I get banned for nothing
[2:15:39] funviking99: got banned for rmt for 1 month last year , missed out on all diablo 4 stuff BibleThump
[2:15:59] funviking99: rmt
[2:16:09] Lausten: Its like watching those traffic cop shows, they stop someone for a broken taillight and all of a sudden its cocaine charges and no drivers lience and weapons and shit..
[2:16:12] Neostigma: fake gold you mean
[2:16:36] RosieSeren: I used to work for an airline, would get the 'they won't let me board being mean to me' check notes ... customer hurled racist abuse and tried to hit at staff, yeah they is usually a reason xD
[2:16:47] jayjayw54: hahaha yeah very true - couple guildies got 7 days in SOD for sitting in ratchet for days just killing allys (The true classic experience) and than all got there names reported and they were basic names
[2:17:08] Lausten: If somethings wrong, usually more than 1 thing is wrong, thats a qoute from Danish police programs like that..
[2:17:09] ImperfectDark: i'm on the subreddit for my Monzo bank all the time and people always stirring panic saying they were banned/locked out of their bank account for nothing (turns out it was crypto stuff)
[2:17:38] Neostigma: I will admit, most my income comes from crypto
[2:17:39] wasserpestie: sure bitcoin has a new ath
[2:17:43] Tankersss: ye, but it's mostly people who are already in
[2:17:44] jayjayw54: haha yeah bitcoin through the roof
[2:17:47] Neostigma: And yes, its getting big again.
[2:17:49] RosieSeren: yeah banks don't like crypto stuff
[2:17:50] blumberquack: Crypto in general will stay around, always has
[2:18:01] blumberquack: but the gimmicks like nfts don't stick around for long
[2:18:28] keyboardturner: did you see the wallstreet bets mod who got arrested lol
[2:18:29] Lausten: @RosieSeren Cause 90% of crypto is illegal activities and money laundry
[2:18:30] CrowMomocle: bitcoin still has higher than this roof to go
[2:18:36] Neostigma: I trade here and there, but long positions ect, like some crypto from last year is now 1500% up for me.
[2:18:58] SlithTheSivak: everyone is if they have a pension fund, also why its easy money, most companies are constantly investing in the stock market every payroll w pension funds
[2:19:03] wasserpestie: What is your opinion about whats going on at RB actually?
[2:19:04] maros_petrus: I was a day trader about year ago and it was the hardest thing to master that I've ever tried. Then I had to quit because of the emotional burnout
[2:19:06] keyboardturner: stocks subreddit filled with bad advice
[2:19:14] wasserpestie: ye
[2:19:28] Sentiaxx: WallStreetBets = meme stock-subreddit. And the mod got arrested for repeatedly dine-and-dashing
[2:19:38] Neostigma: The money I make from work, part of it goes to crypto.
[2:19:51] Neostigma: Pump and dump scheme yeh
[2:19:59] Sentiaxx: Pump and dumping restaurant bills? That's a new one
[2:20:00] SlithTheSivak: reddit IPO bout to pump n dump
[2:20:05] physalis4: dine and dash is going to a restaurant and not paying the bill
[2:20:06] keyboardturner: he kept trying to bring up his day trading incessantly on body cam footage lmao
[2:20:13] Tankersss: dine and dash is when you don't pay at restaurant
[2:20:33] Lausten: @physalis4 Here we just call that stealing
[2:20:36] Neostigma: I ain't saying do crypto ect ect, Just for me, the money I made from it in the last 5 years is worth it for me.
[2:20:44] Sentiaxx: No, the mod was skipping restaurant bills
[2:20:46] Sentiaxx: And was arrested for that
[2:21:02] MediumRareOG: r/wallstreetbets is the zoomer way of losing all your money on options and crypto
[2:21:14] Sentiaxx: He mentioned it on the bodycam footage
[2:21:15] Sentiaxx: LUL
[2:22:10] keyboardturner: more or less
[2:22:15] Neostigma: basically yeh
[2:22:20] TollBoothVideos: That's exactly what pump and dump is
[2:22:22] Tankersss: you talk about it, as you already got millions of that coins and sell to people
[2:22:30] Sentiaxx: 1. Brings up being a daytrader (specifically options) w/o being prompted.  2. Laughs at the bill being $70 to make sure that everyone knew that wasn't a large amount for him.  3. Can't come up with $80 cash, but he flashes the cop his Fidelity account. 4. Demands the cop and restaurant owner apologize to him while he's handcuffed in the back of the car.
[2:22:37] Sentiaxx: That's what happened with the Wallstreetbets mod
[2:22:44] SinicalDev: Fallout tv show trailer looks pog as fuck
[2:22:49] Sentiaxx: But yeah, spot on with the pump n' dump description

[2:23:55] Tankersss: a lot of time it's public or people asking for it from police dept
[2:23:56] Sentiaxx: Oh the footage was released/covered 5 days ago. The mod was arrested in August 2022

[2:27:03] Lausten: Trying to run
[2:27:21] Sentiaxx: He basically has a scheme that involves him having the money to pay, but only in a way that most places don't accept. So he banks on businesses throwing him out of restaurants due to t hat
[2:28:05] TollBoothVideos: Can't say 'That wasn't me!' Cuz no one else would be wearing that frickin' shirt..

[2:56:30] Lausten: @Travnar Best advise is to swap arround to not go insane over not getting certain things.. Even the top people on DFA still have bits and pieces all over the different expansions they dont have yet
[2:56:30] Jelky55: says 10.2 patch
[2:56:50] Jelky55: so mby its 10.2.6 stuff xD

[4:34:50] ElIiera: so it will beta of Cataclysm Classic?
[4:34:55] Shrandamar: thursday/friday is their favorite day for betas to start aswell
[4:35:21] Mergaam: whats the best hunter spec for farming old content?
[4:35:23] Shrandamar: yeah I bet they try to avoid fridays but they've done it more than once
[4:35:27] itwasnt4tony: will we get to see how many changes cata will have with the beta? or will that roll out later
[4:35:37] Dirtnose: People not realising how much work it is putting old code onto new engine/clients
[4:35:53] michaelmm: They don't need to work weekends for a beta tho. They don''t promise Beta's will stay up all the time.
[4:36:31] itwasnt4tony: that's the question haha. what changes are going to be made. a lot of interviews have said they're gonna be pretty adaptable
[4:36:59] fooxytv: rage finder :D
[4:37:41] ElIiera: *still waiting for mysterious 10.2.6
[4:37:54] fooxytv: the real question.. when is Shadowlands Classic?
[4:38:21] ElIiera: NotLikeThis LUL
[4:38:57] Shrandamar: Can't wait for Season of Discovery Shadowlands Edition :P
[4:39:00] HuntingElk: Over grown THINGY??!?
[4:39:03] BananaBaby29: i hope not
[4:39:14] Greatmatt1: I didn't think they'd go as far as Cata, so what do I know
[4:39:16] HuntingElk: lol
[4:39:47] Shrandamar: I think they will do MoP, lots of people missed out and it was a great expansion in hindsight
[4:40:04] ElIiera: LUL
[4:40:13] Mergaam: i can see classic going into Legio
[4:40:23] keyboardturner: WoD Classic 3Head
[4:40:29] Vaffnado: considering legions popularity id expect themt o
[4:40:31] fooxytv: lots of people missed draenor.. it was a great expansion in hindsight
[4:40:45] HuntingElk: Took my car to the mechanic 'cause the thingy and the what-you-ma-call-it were not working.....
[4:40:47] itwasnt4tony: solid decade ago
[4:40:49] Vaffnado: but imo, catra is the "last" of the classic expansions
[4:40:52] Shrandamar: I think people would actually be hyped for Legion, if they wait another 10 years
[4:41:16] Dirtnose: @fooxytv Was it? Still the worst xpac by a mile for me
[4:41:57] Mergaam: the amount of people saying they're quiting after ICC but now eagerly waiting for cat beta lol
[4:41:58] Wextak: milions of damage LuL
[4:41:58] bwoods79: the legendary drops were rough with legion
[4:42:07] xpsha: some of the battle for azeroth stuff makes me feel sick for instance getting nzoth cloak on all characters
[4:42:26] bwoods79: I am sad they took away the leggo attributes from legion..i really enjoyed the wisp form one
[4:42:43] MediumRareOG: "i don't know what they were thinking" --Ancient WoW proverb
[4:43:03] xpsha: I mean I prefer it to shadowlands
[4:43:06] xpsha: and draenor
[4:43:14] BananaBaby29: the story was poor in bfa
[4:43:30] xpsha: mop is up there as my favourite expansion of all time
[4:43:40] Shrandamar: Patch 8.2 was peak wow, so much content
[4:43:53] BBMezzy: Except the whole Uldir out of nowhere thing for the Alliance
[4:43:53] bwoods79: the thing i didn't like about bfa the most was the titanforging etc..couldn't really judge bis and people could get mythic raid loot ilvl gear doing nothing
[4:43:58] MediumRareOG: I like how covenant powers and legendaries still work in SL. I want to see them do that with Legion legendaries in Legion

[4:45:00] MediumRareOG: i hate warforged stuff in Legion, even for legacy content
[4:45:05] bwoods79: anyone miss their mission table?
[4:45:22] mikael_jansson90: just found a funny thing in the game...if u put yourself in que for a dung or raid and  spam press the eye button it changes from green to red ><
[4:45:24] Eregbueye: I do it gave me reasons to do world quests for the hope of crazy titanforge
[4:45:43] MediumRareOG: the proccing of tertiary stats, sockets and epic upgrades is generally awful IMHO
[4:45:58] HuntingElk: Have you completed the "Dive Bar Hop"  achievement??
[4:46:16] BisonD: "100% Completing" *See terms for exclusions and chieves that can fuck off. haha

[4:46:56] NeeK_23: always worth knocking out the quick and easy ones
[4:47:07] NeeK_23: hard ones come later
[4:47:26] xpsha: what is your favourite expansion currently?
[4:47:34] bwoods79: At least they allowed you to unlock flying in ZM, that saved them
[4:47:50] xpsha: mop for me personally
[4:47:52] Sery_Bot: A 90 second ad break is starting! Thank you for sticking with us through this break! seryboLove Ads help support my content. Consider subscribing to remove ads and support the stream!
[4:48:36] Harai_Ulfsark: i loved the black empire aesthetics
[4:48:45] xpsha: didn't hear the last bit of what you said cos of ad break
[4:49:08] HuntingElk: Just checked..looks like the dive bar achievement was wiped (Achievement #13040)
[4:49:20] xpsha: about mop
[4:49:23] Sery_Bot: The ad break is finishing now! seryboLove
[4:49:30] bwoods79: What do you think the biggest improvement they made to the gave ever was?  I am about even with transmog and being able to change spec without respecing all the time
[4:49:32] xpsha: you said something about mop
[4:49:44] MediumRareOG: i honestly believe MoP would be remembered more favorably if it wasn't Kung Fu Panda themed
[4:50:04] Tegger37: yep
[4:50:04] Oswaldovzki: OMG! AoE loot is HUGE
[4:50:06] BisonD: trueeee
[4:50:14] Tegger37: wish they would increase the radias
[4:50:14] Aerisot: MoP
[4:50:18] Tegger37: radius
[4:50:28] Oswaldovzki: I remember the second it went live, I soloed all TBC dungeons XD
[4:50:44] Tegger37: I farm a lot
[4:50:53] bwoods79: Area of Effect looting is a mechanism to be introduced with Mists of Pandaria Mists of Pandaria that allows a player to loot nearby corpses when they loot the first corpse in a group
[4:50:56] Oswaldovzki: Yeah, I'll run EVERYTHING AGAIN!
[4:51:03] Shrandamar: but what will people do when they got all the mogs :P
[4:51:03] Iwony: prepatch is farm time then prolly
[4:51:03] Tegger37: curious to see how they handle tier
[4:51:09] Tankersss: couldn't warriors like learn all the transmog when they introduced the collections?
[4:51:09] HuntingElk: In MoP, I like the having to track several rare hunters pets thru out
[4:51:51] Oswaldovzki: I'm really excited for the transmog changes. TWW is already one of the best x-pac just for that
[4:51:57] MediumRareOG: i've heard people say they liked Highmaul
[4:52:07] bomayaa: I base expansions just on zones and story and questing
[4:52:20] MediumRareOG: but the WoD story was objectively terrible, there was a massive content drought and garrisons never panned out
[4:52:47] bwoods79: bc/Wrath was my fav because I had my own guild and a bunch of great members with social times in ventrillo
[4:52:57] HuntingElk: every expansion has good sections/zones they like, but they might not like the expansion in general
[4:53:05] Shrandamar: I wasnt even subbed during WoD and I demand a refund xD
[4:53:13] xpsha: mop they did really good with world bosses
[4:53:17] StreamElements: Dynamic GROUND Mounts Coming to World of Warcraft? - https://youtu.be/3eLdJTCnhGg
[4:53:20] xpsha: endgame content top notch there
[4:53:47] bwoods79: best feature: gettting rid of borrowed powers
[4:54:02] xpsha: shadowlands was what they learnt from battle for azeroth where they learnt skips but sacrificed the look and feel of that
[4:54:18] BananaBaby29: byeee
