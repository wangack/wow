[4:23:20] Kenjieasygaming: Liquid <3
[4:23:21] Wottl: rogues and mages have definitely been op before, but they're classes that have a mastery level necessary, so they dont dominate in numbers to the general public
[4:23:24] EdgySanTV: ret is good for once and you scrubs lose your mind. watching casters and their 40sec CC to kill stuff is the worst pvp I can imagine
