[0:40:24] carkon: is it Eat Happy in a REWE. Man this guys take my money every week
[0:40:29] Andersonmps: @Sebleh And make the food for the whole week. Not a bad idea
[0:40:30] Deenial: Same, the way I am used to just eating pasta and pesto everyday that when someone charges m ¬£30 for sushi or a steak I feel like I'm being robbed
[0:40:31] divinelightillidan: Sushi is raw fish not cooked.
[0:40:51] demonis87: sushi it‚Äôs lots of sugar
[0:40:54] Sebleh: @deenial naguuraFlower
[0:41:00] Deenial: naguuraFlower @Sebleh
[0:41:15] Sebleh: @andersonmps nah 3 days at a time is best because the food stays fresh by the time you go through it.
[0:41:17] demonis87: I am a bartender in the sushi restaurant
[0:41:18] Kuroz: CatDriving @Deenial
[0:41:31] HeyGuyyYy: sushi is healthy, healthiest is sashimi with just the fish on top of the rice. but it's just dense is calories
[0:41:36] Thanation: raw ingredients tend to be healthier than in their cooked state, if eatable at all
[0:41:39] demonis87: they mix the rice with lots of sugar and vinegar
[0:41:42] Andersonmps: @Sebleh Works too.
[0:41:42] Deenial: on paper, an orange has a lot of sugar, but they are simple sugars and easily broken down. There's more to macro nutrient numbers than a number
[0:41:57] lazyglue_: nothing wrong with sugar
[0:42:32] Andersonmps: Pasta has a lot of carbo. Carbo turns into sugar. Its worst for exemple
[0:42:49] Snowwasp: butter is healthy, it's just milk x)
[0:43:04] mario_kart6: Carbs are good.... even for a diet
[0:43:21] Jack_the_Dipper: I am making today chicken teriyaki with rice
[0:43:22] Sebleh: @deenial pretty sure sucrose is actually good for you in regular amounts (one orange vs 5)
[0:43:29] Mornex: @mario_kart6 some carbs are good yes, not all carbs
[0:43:38] Andersonmps: LUL
[0:43:51] Thanation: s√ºdtirol is not italy per se :D
[0:43:53] TotallyNotRaien: you do use a lot of hand gestures when speaking tho
[0:43:53] tea2468: some sushi can be unhealthy, like sushi with sauce, cream cheese, soy sauce, or fried crunchy bits
[0:44:01] Andersonmps: Italian more, you Italian!
[0:44:02] jacksplatt: but do you want to eat pasta everyday?
[0:44:07] Thanation: depends on the people you are asking KEKW
[0:44:07] looya: do u eat pizza when u dont eat pasta?
[0:44:08] zMilamber: basta la pasta
[0:44:08] Sebleh: Naguura you‚Äôre giving him inverted Italian hands in anger your point is not going through
[0:44:17] Klara: just eat what tastes nice ‚úÖ
[0:44:20] Utinis: No, you have to be the stereotypical italien naguuraREE
[0:44:26] MaxGrandpre: yea why don't you eat pastas 3 times a day? hmmMeeting
[0:44:30] AceReformed: Hey caro, hello chat
[0:44:36] Sebleh: pasta is solid poor people food
[0:44:37] mario_kart6: @mornex as with everything in this world, my point still stands that carbs are good. You need a balanced diet without cutting out stuff unless you have an actual medical reason
[0:44:49] jacksplatt: i ate a lot of rice as a college student
[0:45:03] TotallyNotRaien: better than the men eating overcooked pasta with ketchup
[0:45:09] Andersonmps: The italian hands during the rant send me off LUL
[0:45:09] MC_Sotarkadin: I did the same with "pasta" when i was homeless and couch hopping, I would eat 25 cent ramen every day.
[0:45:21] vikutoru11: Good morning naguuraClap
[0:45:29] Kuroz: CatDriving @vikutoru11
[0:45:30] Sebleh: You guys didn‚Äôt have $5 gallon jugs of wine over there?
[0:45:35] jwillhue: I knew a guy who saved money by using rag√∫ on ramen
[0:45:39] Deenial: catKISS @Kuroz
[0:45:40] carkon: But can you eat nothing and drink twice the wine?
[0:45:41] jacksplatt: ramen is awesome. i did that also when i was couch hopping
[0:45:46] Deenial: catWave vikutoru11

[0:46:57] aNxje: everything is healthy, everything is unhealthy. depends how much you shovel in
[0:46:59] tea2468: hmm
[0:46:59] jwillhue: if ur on steroids it doesn‚Äôt matter you lose weight
[0:47:00] FadeXbp: People think if smthing is healthy they can eat tons of it per day.
[0:47:03] legendarism: NOTED
[0:47:20] TheClermont: Moderation and Balance thats are the two word ;P
[0:47:22] love_eggplant: only thing that matters is calorie INTAKE AND EXPENDATURE
[0:47:27] TotallyNotRaien: naguura the nutriologist
[0:47:33] Andersonmps: Avocados are healty and has a lot of calories. For exemple. Not that good for diet
[0:47:34] Thoreya: just gotta calorie count
[0:47:43] tea2468: yeah, just the portion size
[0:47:48] jwillhue: you need fat tho so avacados are great
[0:47:52] mario_kart6: You can literally lose weight by eating junkfood everyday. What you do during your day plays a big role, if you're very active etc. Now being healthy is another thing
[0:47:53] Nicao3: the important is how much deficit you have on your diet, you'll loose weight anyway
[0:48:05] Sebleh: Fun fact: if you want to lose weight, get depression. that‚Äôs how I lost 15 lbs living with my brother and got them back when I moved out and got better YEP
[0:48:17] Klara: conclusion: sushi every day klaraNoted
[0:48:26] love_eggplant: @Nicao3 you need to make sure to eat protein the most. otherwise you're not just losing fat, you'll be losing muscle.
[0:48:34] jwillhue: why it‚Äôs better than having heart problems

[0:48:51] MC_Sotarkadin: didnt they say, that this whole thing of "superfoods" was made up and not really thing
[0:48:52] Sebleh: avocados are like everything else: good in moderation.
[0:48:52] love_eggplant: avocados*

[0:49:22] elmirlock: avacado are the natural butter
[0:49:24] love_eggplant: they are unsaturated fats = amazing for your brain
[0:49:29] Sebleh: Like salmon has some really good fats and shit but it is a LOT of fat can have a lot of calories too iirc
[0:49:43] Thanation: you may loose weight by eating nutella
[0:49:44] jwillhue: nuts are bad for your teeth tho
[0:49:48] Sebleh: nuts are also high carbs iirc
[0:49:51] Thanation: depends on the mass
[0:49:55] MC_Sotarkadin: @jwillhue Exatcly, "I am on a diet, so I eat les" then consumes 1500 calorites in one drink from Starbucks
[0:49:56] Andersonmps: dn
[0:50:11] Sebleh: I remember hearing eating nuts as a snack is kind of a trap
[0:50:19] Sebleh: for weight loss*
[0:50:39] love_eggplant: sushi is unhealthy, it has raw fish
[0:50:52] TotallyNotRaien: nuts are super calorie dense
[0:50:54] love_eggplant: it can make you sick
[0:51:02] Deenial: not sushi grade fish
[0:51:11] Deenial: She's not fishing up a piece of cod and sticking it her sushi lmao
[0:51:14] Deenial: pls , critical thinking
[0:51:14] Sebleh: feenFail
[0:51:26] Andersonmps: I mean. Cooking your own food is cheaper and healthier
[0:51:27] Sebleh: anything can make you sick but sushi isn‚Äôt made with shit expiring fish lol
[0:51:28] love_eggplant: "sushi grade fish" lmao
[0:51:32] love_eggplant: they are all raw & bad
[0:51:38] jacksplatt: i am doing Noom program right now. Love it. It is a program that teaches you about weight loss and work on educating you about the why and nutrition
[0:51:39] Thanation: agreed
[0:51:48] TotallyNotRaien: i mostly drink water and still fat
[0:51:59] jrs9794: but that means no alcohol
[0:52:05] Thoreya: i drink water alch and caffeine
[0:52:10] k4iserwow: Hello Caro ü§ó
[0:52:11] Thanation: drinking coke with 150kcal/100ml and then you didn't eat anything

[0:53:01] Thanation: @love_eggplant why is raw fish unhealthy then?
[0:53:09] jacksplatt: i thought Orange Juice was good for you...and then I checked the label...whoa dude
[0:53:39] Sebleh: yeah it‚Äôs true people drink half their daily caloric intake it‚Äôs kinda nuts. if you plan out proper meals you can get your base metabolic rate off just food and water and if you add sugary calorie heavy drinks then no wonder people can‚Äôt lose weight
[0:54:18] Andersonmps: She wants to escape all the sheneningans of being a streamer
[0:54:21] tea2468: coke has so much sugar
[0:54:29] Sebleh: You have to keep your caffeine alcohol system balance and not dilute it with too much blood. who knows what your heart would do if it had to pump anything that isn‚Äôt caffeine or alcohol.
[0:54:33] Kuroz: you didn't
[0:54:38] ddfoxyy1: coke hydrated me

[0:55:16] Deenial: @love_eggplant the irony
[0:55:19] Sebleh: honestly all you have to do is just not buy the soda lol
[0:55:21] jacksplatt: and the hidden calories in dressings and sauces
[0:55:23] Sebleh: @deenial seriously
[0:55:28] love_eggplant: @love_eggplant keep eating raw fish bro
[0:55:31] Deenial: @Sebleh naguuraGiggle

[0:55:44] love_eggplant: water & fat injected salmon
[0:55:47] love_eggplant: full of disease
[0:55:49] BunnyOnMeth: All of this doesn't even start to scratch the surface of why people want to lose weight, when most current review meta analysis does not significantly correlate weight with healthiness
[0:55:49] TotallyNotRaien: and thats different from your cattle meat?
[0:55:53] Sebleh: @love_eggplant wait are you vegan?

[0:58:04] Sebleh: You don‚Äôt have to try to be a gym rat to eat healthy too tho

[1:00:57] AceReformed: But also, you can be focused on eating TOO healthy, just like you can be focused on being to physically active (hitting the gym 7 times a week for example) this can also cause opposite effects
[1:00:59] love_eggplant: eating well & exercise goes hand in hand
[1:01:08] love_eggplant: it's the perfect combination
[1:01:11] Babyclaws: do you think this "pick whatever eclipse you want" system sort of makes the entire point of the eclipse mechanic pointless? if my wrath can 24/7 be empowered, why not just buff wrath and starfire damage instead?
[1:01:16] flirt_alert: Its all about moderation
[1:01:19] Sebleh: but not eating fish

[1:01:38] Sebleh: I can‚Äôt believe my local farm raised pasta is so unhealthy

[1:02:31] BizBichou: good thing my supermarket only sells fresh caught wild fish ThumbsUpCat
[1:02:32] tea2468: exercise is good for your health too! exercise helps your bones get stronger, your heart, lungs, etc. there are mental health benefits too. usually muscle is a consequence of training

[1:49:57] itsClubby: a lot of deaths at this level are one shots too, super hard to avoid when mistakes are made and it‚Äôs easy to make a mistake, a small positioning error etc is fatal
[1:50:13] jacksplatt: i don't really understand troll behavior. I wonder if there are any papers on JSTOR that I could read discussing the psychology of the troll.
[1:50:14] itsClubby: so someone will look ‚Äúbad‚Äù but it‚Äôs just not the case
[1:51:11] itsClubby: I can understand trolling friends and people you know the boundaries for, but doing it to ransoms is just odd

[1:56:16] Sebleh: they added eclipse to SoD tho
[1:56:24] HengerHenger: Why Shadowland dungeons arent being played in Dragonflight?
[1:56:30] Sebleh: I think the eclipse in SoD is the WoD version?

[1:57:21] Sebleh: @learningtogrowtogether if you want populated servers then Illidan/Malganis/Stormrage/Area52/Tichondrius/Dalaran are all solid
[1:57:27] itsClubby: oh god cringe cam

[2:01:01] itsClubby: for sure I bet people love chatting with their full name on display @2000ish
[2:01:23] Sebleh: @hengerhenger it varies. sometimes they‚Äôre even. YouTube is weird for streams.

[2:02:55] Kuroz: CatDriving
[2:03:08] learningtogrowtogether: I miss the game a lot
[2:03:13] Sebleh: @learningtogrowtogether yes! Stormrage is a primarily alliance server. while factions don‚Äôt matter much for most gameplay stuff, there‚Äôs some social aspects that are still split.
[2:03:16] ChaosRenown: how many hours until mdi starts?
[2:03:19] Kuroz: 4
[2:03:27] ChaosRenown: oh nice
[2:03:31] Sebleh: poggies 4 hours to mdi

[2:06:02] Kadlynn: Any one know when the MDI is expected to end? I know it starts at 10 PST but im at work until 2 pst.
[2:06:29] Sebleh: naguuraSip
[2:06:34] Kuroz: day 1 normally ends a bit before 3 pm pst

[2:07:34] holymommades: It usually goes until 6 pm est or a bit after depending on the timing of dungeons
[2:07:36] Sebleh: @learningtogrowtogether I honestly dont have a guild or anything. I play by myself and mostly pug endgame content. I know a guild on illidan that‚Äôs very friendly and open to people who just want to play the game tho.
[2:07:41] Kuroz: hmmMeeting  day 1 is shorter. cause its 4/6/6 for the games
[2:08:05] Kuroz: 4/6/4 but the finals is best of 5*
[2:08:16] SimenT94: I prefer that to getting spoiled at least
[2:08:20] Sebleh: @learningtogrowtogether Liquid Plus is a community guild made up of Team Liquid fans. my Paladin is in there and I might start playing that soon but it‚Äôs open for anyone. I can get someone to invite you if you like.
[2:08:32] Sebleh: that‚Äôs in Illidan tho, not Stormrage
[2:08:35] learningtogrowtogether: @sebleh ok. I‚Äôm sure il be trying out different servers. all my toons are on a now dead server

[2:09:19] learningtogrowtogether: @sebleh I can make a toon on that server
[2:10:35] Sebleh: @learningtogrowtogether if you‚Äôre in Naguura‚Äôs discord, DM me your character name and I can get you an invite to the guild in Illidan.
[2:10:46] Sebleh: I‚Äôm Sebleh on discord as well
[2:11:18] learningtogrowtogether: my main guys are on Baelgun server. it‚Äôs so dead there
[2:11:53] Sebleh: FWIW in about 6 months we will have cross server guilds so that won‚Äôt be an issue anymore
[2:12:03] MrNaco: damn she's back. RIP chair stream

[2:15:09] Kuroz: you know sushi is unhealthy? I read it for 30 minutes in twitch chat, must be true hmmMeeting
[2:15:31] Sebleh: yeah fish is bad for you because some guy in twitch chat said so
[2:15:42] Sebleh: vegetables? HUH
[2:15:49] Sebleh: am I in the right stream?
[2:16:00] Wildpants10: do you eat sushi with wasabe?
[2:16:03] Sebleh: This IS Nagoogoo right? seblehNotes
[2:16:06] Wildpants10: or nah
[2:16:11] Amresh: do MDI start today or tomorrow?

[2:19:24] Sebleh: this chat log would be filled with ‚ÄúSebleh: ___‚Äù and the collective IQ of this chat would drop even further than just from watching a Moonkin stream.
[2:20:10] Sebleh: @2000ish she‚Äôs not wrong though naguuraSip
[2:20:59] 2000ish: i dunno i laugh at lots you say sebleh naguuraGiggle naguuraLove naguuraLove
[2:21:20] Sebleh: new raging seemed so good on paper but once they added all these dungeons with infinite stop requirements it just felt so much worse than letting the tank kite lol

[2:21:38] Kuroz: naguuraLove naguuraLove naguuraLove
[2:22:01] Sebleh: nah dude outside of one-shots in high keys this season has INSANE potential for MDI I think
[2:22:35] Sebleh: I don‚Äôt even know the strats but based on the dungeon pool and the niche power of some specs I think this could be a crazy tournament.
[2:22:37] MrSensitive999: im super excited for mdi. i hope dorki's team does well
[2:22:37] Natthielm: why do people do these packs nowadays? they are disgusting
[2:23:02] AbieCherry: @Natthielm because the other side is even worse ?
[2:23:05] Sebleh: @natthielm left side > right side in high keys
[2:23:37] 2000ish: is imfiredup playing in the mdi?
[2:23:50] Sebleh: when you just yeehaw pull shit the right side is easier, but if your group is coordinated and knows how to handle stuff the left side is better.
[2:23:54] HairClog: how long till MDI?
[2:24:00] Kuroz: 3 hrs 30
[2:24:02] Sebleh: 3.5 hours @hairclog

[3:09:14] burncrus_dkw: @Sebleh So low....
[3:09:30] Sebleh: @burncrus_dkw it‚Äôs a speed run competition not a push competition
[3:09:54] Lonely_TTV: dorki was page 1 aswell
[3:09:58] Kuroz: go to teams instead of dungeons you can mouseover their times
[3:10:07] Kuroz: instead of the checking all the runs
[3:10:13] HairClog: Ya this isn‚Äôt the Great Push. Speed runs which I prefer.
[3:10:17] burncrus_dkw: @Sebleh yeah but like a 22..... they already proven in qualifying that  its to low :D

[3:11:48] Sebleh: oh nvm
[3:11:52] michaelbluth: @HairClog first time looking at mdi?>
[3:11:53] Kuroz: not sure which one of the 2 is faster
[3:12:14] HairClog: @michaelbluth no but I can still hope
[3:12:25] michaelbluth: confirmed, nagura hates dorki

[3:13:25] Sebleh: @burncrus_dkw there was an exploit used for EB in time trials and short matches isn‚Äôt really a bad thing for qualifiers. they‚Äôll be higher for the finals but still has to be low enough to stay out of instant fiesta range.
[3:13:25] HairClog: hey did i see some mistweavers in there?
[3:13:30] Fausstty: Happy Big Friday
[3:14:01] vikutoru11: assDank

[3:17:43] Zacaree55: Naguura you always play good jams. :)
[3:18:09] Sebleh: I think this is a bad season for tgp tbh
[3:18:19] Sebleh: mdi fits the tuning better this season IMO

[3:19:14] ghostorrca: Hi!
[3:19:27] ghostorrca: Spreadsheet time!
[3:19:52] business_man_alex: I just think TGP is so much more engaging over the course of the event and is more relatable to the viewer
[3:20:03] winraider: Echo will play today guys?
[3:20:17] Kuroz: echo is playing today
[3:20:49] HairClog: Fair enough. I just love seeing huge crazy pulls and them melting them down.

[3:21:20] ultideath: Guys why is Naguura throwing up gang signs? Did she join a gang?
[3:21:33] Babyclaws: MDI will be huge pulls on these lower keys
[3:21:34] TotallyNotRaien: shes always been in the moonkin gang
[3:21:50] HairClog: You guys think veng will be the go to tank next season too? I‚Äôm hoping guardians give them a run for their money but veng just has so much util.
[3:21:54] TutzorTV: kappamkuzzy naguuraThinking
[3:22:17] Babyclaws: @HairClog it depends on tier set voting tbh
[3:22:28] HairClog: @babyclaws yup! Thats why i love MDI
[3:22:33] Sebleh: not even voting it‚Äôs just tuning
[3:22:36] azi_cs: kiras team play today or next weekend?

[3:22:54] Sebleh: after mdi finals they‚Äôll probably either buff other tanks or slightly nerf vdh and prot pal

[3:23:21] StreamElements: https://raider.io/events/mdi-dragonflight-season-3/brackets/group-a
[3:23:39] ultideath: Honestly the hardest part about being in a gang is probably learning the gang signs. Naguura has to keep starting over :(
[3:24:13] beldemort25: when does it start?
[3:24:29] Kuroz: in 2 hours and a half
[3:24:38] beldemort25: @Kuroz Ty!
[3:25:01] HairClog: I miss when these events had a central location and all the teams and casters went there. Not a big fan of everyone just casting from home
[3:25:23] michaelbluth: @HairClog that was only the finals right? not the cups?
[3:26:10] Kuroz: depends on the season
[3:26:11] Babyclaws: that's blizzcon or the globals that would be a LAN yeah
[3:26:22] Kuroz: casters did 2 seasons with regionals in the studio too
[3:26:35] Kuroz: but ye players only traveled for the finals

[3:27:00] HairClog: Just seemed like a much better show and production value.
[3:27:19] Sebleh: @hairclog while nothing has been announced it seems very possible that the War Within S1 MDI and AWC finals will be at blizzcon
[3:27:44] HairClog: @sebleh Nice! That would be amazing
[3:28:21] BizBichou: NOTED fact checking
[3:28:24] skyesarrow: no way bolstering when you have destro lock in wcm bolstering will be irrelevant with all the stuns

[3:29:13] Hemenia: 6pm?
[3:29:13] HairClog: I wonder how the casters would feel. Would they prefer to just stay home or do you think they like going to the finals and all that
[3:29:20] Kuroz: 7 pm
[3:29:34] Babyclaws: echo is saying gg EZ
[3:29:56] kalegeneral: ya
