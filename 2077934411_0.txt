[3:46:54] maiiisan18: loool, I was seeing Vanguards and other top rets not having it, so I wasn‚Äôt sure
[3:46:58] NotASkiller: just be aware the legendary does not protect you from queuing into SCRIPTERS
[3:47:05] bababwe55: at cata its feral/disc not better Kappa
[3:47:19] maiiisan18: but most people seem to say it‚Äôs worth using
[3:47:34] hakunaxy: the scripting is the most annoying shit never seen that before wotlk came out..
[3:47:37] maiiisan18: for PvP that is. of course PvE is bis
[3:48:03] deerobx: Its bis for both, simple
[3:48:04] NotASkiller: @hakunaxy started becoming a thing once WARMANERS showed up.. coincidence?
[3:48:19] NotASkiller: üßê

[3:52:39] kooolzin: not soon enough
[3:54:17] scopemeup: holy shit??? is this real rasel? aka r1 rasel?
[3:54:25] NotASkiller: @1337unkwn there's even a clip of AHK being exposed installed on Dekel's PC. he took a bite of the forbidden fruit
[3:54:47] NotASkiller: Dekel drank the private server Kool aid
[3:55:07] 1337unkwn: @NotASkiller oh no OMG thats so craazy should we report him to the police?
[3:55:40] NotASkiller: if you can't win without 3rd parties just say that lol
[3:55:51] NotASkiller: it's ok my little man
[3:56:05] scopemeup: who is dekel? ive heard things but got no clue who that actually is
[3:56:27] Srenix: check discord
[3:56:27] pawpawsz: Some streamer who puts on an accent to make fun of Americans
[3:56:29] NotASkiller: Good warrior but he spent too much time around warmaners
[3:56:45] scopemeup: @NotASkiller as good as rasel?
[3:56:45] NotASkiller: they turn him to the dark side
[3:57:09] kooolzin: @scopemeup as good as hurley
[3:57:18] NotASkiller: @scopemeup don't mean to be e rude but I don't know rasel :(
[3:57:33] scopemeup: ??? rasel is r1 warrior world
[3:57:37] hakunaxy: As much as Dekel is a Rage Kiddy and even if he uses Scripts i believe hes good enaugh to get R1 without ..
[3:57:38] scopemeup: how dont you know about him?
[3:57:40] cvsthelordx: ya rasel op
[3:57:41] scopemeup: you australian?
[3:57:41] NotASkiller: lol oops
[3:57:59] mwako: @hakunaxy yeah because he counter gears every game
[3:58:05] hakunaxy: i seen him play without and hes not a bad player by any means
[3:58:10] NotASkiller: I don't play wrath or watch it much. just always hear about cheating in arenas

[3:58:39] Sublimeqt: From how much you talk about it, Kinda makes me think you went against a cheater at like 1800 rating and RQ the game skiller.
[3:58:47] hakunaxy: @mwako  playing warrior myself for 15 years now and in wotlk i get why he uses sindra trinket against sp/mage its annoying ass fck to face your in novas,sheeps and other shit while they shatter your ass with abombs..
[3:59:18] mwako: ya ofc but he counter gears every game there is no skill in that
[3:59:18] cvsthelordx: LUL
[3:59:34] cvsthelordx: @mwako they don‚Äôt get it brudda
[3:59:38] hakunaxy: @NotASkiller  It happens mostly on 3k+ not realy happens on low Rating ..
[3:59:39] NotASkiller: @sublimeqt KEKW I never played wrath. just watched Bean beansCringe play it but he quit and I was hoping he would play with pojke one day :(
[3:59:57] kooolzin: how dare the enemy team have a favourable matchup against me, must put sindra trinket and 1400 resil
[4:00:16] scopemeup: just glad the long and boring arena games ended with tbc classic...
[4:00:24] hakunaxy: without the scripters you would see way more sod players and streamers streaming and playing wrath but they fcked up Arena for everyone and dont even realize it just to get a Titel wich Nobody will see anyways ^^

[4:05:14] noopelol: @Reeceboss well if ur 2k+ u get 1,3k arena points per week, as hpal u need 5set (u dont need weapon bcs u get one from pve), the price of items i think is reduced by now, so u would need around 7,5k arena points roughly, that means u need to cap 6weeks of 2s, which theoretically should be enough since the season is ending in roughly 2months but u also need to get lucky with the pve items (bauble for instance drops rarely)
[4:05:31] Reeceboss: @noopelol ok ty sir
[4:05:34] noopelol: ü§ì
[4:05:39] Reeceboss: i can also cut some short cuts with voa right

[4:07:11] jamminlove: ya
[4:07:16] mwako: @jamminlove
[4:07:29] demongodxtv: rasel is so much nicer to watch than shinta @Minpojke xD

[5:42:32] hakunaxy: seems like most wotlk arena playesr are simply on privat servers as soon as they knew wotlk doesnt continue they left..
[5:43:21] mathematician3: playing wotlk pservers when classic wotlk is up makes no sense
[5:44:06] hakunaxy: it actually does because alot of wotlk players wanna play wotlk they dont play cata so why waste time if you dont continue anyways..

[5:46:38] hakunaxy: they simply dont waste time to grind a new account when the acc because worthless to them with cata..
[5:47:00] Eskendereya: blizz should release a classic wotlk server that is strictly pvp with soloq and arena seasons once classic wrath is over
[5:47:00] hakunaxy: if wotlk would have had a server that continues blizz would have made such a good move by doing that..
[5:47:40] hakunaxy: it makes absolutly no sense zero sense that wotlk doesnt have a server from business standpoint and community wise..
[5:47:51] forkly1: they did for classic they might wotlk if people want it

[5:54:10] fd90h: your ticket is probably in one of those queues that are not part of cs, that is, someone from cs will have transferred it to one of those queues that will be from an external/dead department and the metrics to resolve the ticket do not affect the employees and the only thing that should appear is that the ticket was 'transferred'.

[6:06:19] Sublimeqt: Challenge mode dungeons > M+

[6:07:44] Ninemmglock: before redbuff

[6:08:04] kourtius1: wod prune so many abilities tho
[6:08:07] hakunaxy: arms warrior was actually fun in wod..
[6:08:46] dogsenses: tbc wrath cata mop were all still same game with added extension, wod was smthing else
[6:09:16] hakunaxy: @dogsenses  i think wod was still the same in legion was the first time they complely changed everything..
[6:09:54] dogsenses: ye legion as different for sure, but if u compare wod from mop. u notice clear differences
[6:10:41] hakunaxy: With Legion pressing any Button was unsatisfying zero Endorphin boost from hitting anything with your Spells.. No real Crits stationary dmg the whole Time..

[7:05:35] Bloodx: google it
[7:05:52] weirdlooking2: depends on what tax, are we not discussing job tax?
[7:06:00] Bloodx: " Har du samlet botid i Norge i 10 √•r eller mer f√∏r du flyttet fra Norge, kan skatteplikten til Norge opph√∏re f√∏rst tre √•r etter det √•ret du har bosatt deg fast i utlandet. Dette betyr at du fortsatt er skattepliktig til Norge det √•ret du flytter og minimum tre √•r til."
