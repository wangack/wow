[1:24:31] pavel0991: I dont understand that no loot statement , where for the first time of many expansion me and all my firends geared up in pve faster than ever before and capped bis.
[1:24:39] tigzie: 9.2 in 2022 and you are probably very right
[1:24:44] bruhSit_farmer: lmao imagine them announcing the next expac before release of 9.1
[1:24:59] 3663Sharad: 9.1 hits august live, 3 months later blizzcon with 9.2 and next xpac announcement. sounds "good" for marketing
[1:25:10] OphieBee: I was anticipating a small 2-3 boss raid like we got with Crucible of Storms in Ardenweald involving Gorak'Tul or another big Thros character in Jailer's attempt to unlock the Heart of the Forest
[1:25:45] TheCliffyShow: @OphieBee I was hoping for a Drust raid to.
[1:25:47] bruhSit_farmer: yea that sounds likely ophie
[1:25:53] bruhSit_farmer: i thought drust 9.1
[1:26:12] Maego1: I wish they made something like in cataclysm, that you had 3 raids with like 4-5 bosses for first tier, was cool imo
[1:26:15] OphieBee: If that's what happens maybe 9.1.5 or something if Jailer raid is 9.2 idk
[1:26:58] OphieBee: Let Sylvanas go out in a Revenge Arc since Jailer responsible for everything that happened to her
[1:27:00] elvia_: 9.1 will be nice, the new ilvl in mythic plus with valors, I cant wait
[1:27:02] akulan: Yeah i did really enjoy the story

[1:30:20] OphieBee: If Sylvanas is gonna beef it I hope after a confrontation with Tyrande and her not killing sylvanas she goes out making a blow to the Jailer for him being responsible (If indirectly) for her undeath
[1:30:38] TheCliffyShow: @Maego1 At least, they aren't ManBearPigs.
[1:30:53] elvia_: Redemption arc for sylvanas for sure
[1:31:06] OphieBee: Revenge arc at least
[1:32:04] stubbedub: varian
[1:32:16] OphieBee: Nah I think she's just putting 2 and 2 together finally and just dealing some kind of damage to the jailer to give us an opening against him in his raid

[2:49:15] nocturnal_2195: @towelliee  on my battle.net account it says i have The Burning Crusade Classic Beta. I was wondering if it says that for everyone or is it just people that will be getting beta
[2:49:33] SpratsTV: @insanity2195 you must still have classic beta installed
[2:49:53] nocturnal_2195: nah I never have classic beta
[2:50:09] Pufendorf99: @realdevv ok, I guess thats a legit reason but most players usually wants beta to see new content, which this isnt so I dont see the reason why they complain about not getting it. If Blizzard wants me to do beta, I want something in return. I dont work for free ;)
[2:50:16] nocturnal_2195: @towelliee  gotcha ty
[2:50:22] Torjix: @Towelliee what server are you? are you on Azuresong?

[3:43:20] Federaldemon: @Towelliee SL youtube video is so accurate it actually hurts :D
[3:43:23] Deeee4: Is this for a mount @Towelliee
[3:43:31] hyperx11y: i'm sorry but is this classic ?
[3:43:37] PieceOfPanic: Very true. Aight ^^
[3:43:40] Medervik: how token even helps agains bots? its only makes buying gold legal
[3:43:48] EggwithEdges: I'm waiting for Diablo 2 Resurrected, love Diablo 2
[3:44:09] Thunderbrew: Is Shadowlands bad?
[3:44:12] Malindan: I enjoyed the videos
[3:44:14] Valzark: mounts in classic LUL
[3:44:21] Federaldemon: I mean it i can literally stand behind all the points you made KEKW

[3:44:38] ventu105: lol
[3:44:44] Aidler: youtube vid was totally appropriate
[3:45:07] Exodeo_: Shadowlands feels like a missed opportunity for blizz tbh with everyone bored in lockdown
[3:45:20] PieceOfPanic: I don't get the hype for M+
[3:45:30] PieceOfPanic: I liked challenge mode way more
[3:45:33] alextheory_: to be fair they can still fixe it.
[3:45:34] ReinholdtRanger: I think the video was great and addressed what we're all thinking
[3:45:50] WhiteKnight74648: I spent more time on my phone playing wow then i did on my pc last weekend
[3:45:59] laughing_octopus: ya it a good video
[3:46:07] belfastcl: maybe the bald one will react to it
[3:46:13] laughing_octopus: towellie spitting fire
[3:46:22] WhiteKnight74648: But yeah that was a solid video
[3:46:37] Deeee4: Where abouts are you  @Towelliee on the map\
[3:46:41] Noobish101: played it for a week payed $70....
[3:46:47] k_randals: @towelliee It was a good video, the game has a ton of problems right now. Mine right now are that covenants are all spec based so to play 2 specs in most cases you need to level characters to be competitive and do Mythic.
[3:47:01] aid280: I think Shadowlands is great.
[3:47:05] Noobish101: shadowlands was a big disappointment just like the last 4 expansions
[3:47:13] PieceOfPanic: There's a lot of mediocre players that gave up on the fight to reach mythic
[3:47:41] oTOKEo: i dont think so
[3:47:43] SmokyBlind: no
[3:47:46] metavahn231: SL just sucks
[3:47:51] SmokyBlind: only 1
[3:47:53] hamppa: 14+8
[3:48:03] Sleepy_Platypus: how do you see the future of wow ? and blizzard as a whole? @Towelliee
[3:48:25] GummiFtw: is this preparation for tbc?
[3:48:50] PieceOfPanic: That's worse for pvp'ers. U need to have 4 of the class you play, one for each covenant
[3:49:02] Medervik: TBC pservers die like 3 times faster than vanilla. So idk about that
[3:49:04] alextheory_: without pandemic you think the game would be 2x better?
[3:49:05] Federaldemon: Decline :)
[3:49:09] PieceOfPanic: Technically
[3:49:16] Nin3r101: nin3r101 subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 32 months, currently on a 18 month streak! 
[3:49:29] laughing_octopus: the problem with wow that it lacks vision
[3:49:32] stratiss: WoW is gonna be fine it just needs new content
[3:49:32] Moobot: Check out Towelliee's latest Youtube video! https://youtu.be/U8-64zqVa8k Shadowlands needs some help
[3:50:25] PieceOfPanic: We can't entirely blame the pandemic though xD
[3:50:41] NickLeonhearth: When is it ok to stop blaming covid for everything?
[3:50:51] PieceOfPanic: Aye
[3:50:56] Deeee4: They can work from home with the tech age we are in
[3:50:57] PieceOfPanic: Fair point.
[3:51:05] Exodeo_: Is it an idea for them to just give up on SL and fully focus on the next exp instead like they did with Wod?
[3:51:05] Moobot: towGreen Shadowlands Limited Edition TOWELLIEE covenant shirts AND Towelliee hats are LIVE! check them out HERE! | Dbh.la/towelliee towBlue
[3:51:06] belfastcl: delays might not be their fault, but system design is
[3:51:18] alextheory_: @SleepyWolfZzz when its going to be done and we realise its the same shit. If you see improvement you get that it was from covid
[3:51:23] Aidler: corona was not their fault. making bad decisions is their fault.
[3:51:25] Layercake: Blizzard keep pumping out features like Thorgast, Islands, Maw, etc, and them spend 2 years fixing it. Instead of focus in solving the real issues of the game, gear acquisition, player progression and class design.
[3:51:33] Sandman_88: @belfastcl hard agree
[3:51:35] prismatic1111: when they stop stopping society @SleepyWolfZzz
[3:51:42] Malindan: Stopped playing for now because I don't want to push keys or raid. Hope they manage to get their groove once they can return to the office.
[3:51:42] Federaldemon: I hope but I doubt it :(
[3:51:49] Baaltaza: @Layercake this
[3:51:52] Jzstyles: just give me tbc and I will gladly quarantine for years

[3:52:53] Medervik: MC and BWL was a joke even with ''proper" tunning
[3:53:08] Federaldemon: I wouldnt mind getting back TF, but corruptions doing 90% of your DMG? NAH
[3:53:36] PieceOfPanic: Well, replayabillity is not the same as infinite grind and slotmachine systems. They got that confused.
[3:53:37] falldrgn: Do you think the raids will have the same up time as Classic? Where Content is cleared in like 2 hours?
[3:53:44] Kain4ever: so woltk ?
[3:54:01] MrGattz: unless they delay 10.0 a whole year
[3:54:04] Layercake: In Legion with had M+, after 6 years...the games need another game chaining system. Pumping out more affixes in M+ is just low hanging fruit.
[3:54:43] BlueBeast33: 10.0 is a huge milestone too, they definitely don't want to fuck that up
[3:54:46] MrGattz: 10.0 is suppose to be the big one. new planet. azeroth going boom. they needed to be working on 10.0 2 years ago
[3:54:52] liketwentywizards: It goes east and then south
[3:54:58] einself111: I bet they won't have any problems releasing the next cod cause there are so many teams working on that franchise ... wow just needs more devs ...
[3:55:07] Valzark: i ready for TBC almost full BiS in P6 FeelsGoodMan lets go
[3:55:11] PieceOfPanic: east. always east.

[3:57:33] Aidler: hmm the answer system of twitch is somehow messed up
[3:57:35] liketwentywizards: Thats not him

[4:15:40] Shrenko: can you not pass covid over to other people @Towelliee ?
[4:15:43] dcorey416: towelliee goes to vegas ends up turning into the hang over movie
[4:15:53] GarSeason: Yea you can carry it and pass it to people sitll
[4:15:53] einself111: Damn you are so far ahead in the US .... there is no chance for younger people in EU where i live at the moment to get vaccinated FeelsBadMan
[4:15:59] KingofMeccano: my sister had the oxford 1 only had the common side effects of sickness and tiredness felt better the next day
[4:16:06] Chibs243: How do you get to go out after the jabs? You can still carry and transmit the virus to others
[4:16:12] razoraus: America defeated covid?
[4:16:18] Melb1n: Vaccacine doenst give 100% immunity for those mutations of the virus atm :/
[4:16:19] PYRO_MANI8C: ive had covid already and i was denied for the shot the other day lol

[4:17:22] dcorey416: Mass is starting to let 16 and up get the vaccine
[4:17:22] MrGattz: not until we remove florida from the map
[4:17:26] markmclean24: Herd immunity soon enough tbh
[4:17:28] tripreality00: Getting the vaccine doesnt mean you cant get the virus. It means that if you do get the virus you wont get as severe effects from the virus.
[4:17:37] lanara233: Party in the city while the covid's on. Infections on the beach till the break of dawn.
[4:17:38] MrGattz: @markmclean24 stop
[4:17:46] Thunderbrew: Summer is on the way
[4:17:46] markmclean24: In the UK

[4:17:59] Phatlooter: Colorado
[4:18:00] razoraus: wont they go home and spread it everywhere agian
[4:18:06] Lasidor: "Florida is going to have an outbreak."  Those arent even Florida residents out there partying, its all the people traveling to the beach lol
[4:18:15] MrGattz: @markmclean24 even in the uk. herd immunity is the WORST form of protection you can have.
[4:18:15] Thoreya: like 30% of the population at least have one shot in the US. its gonna be gone in a couple months
[4:18:31] Syllvn: @markmclean24 Ty for saying what I wanted to.
[4:18:43] Syllvn: Ahhh no I replied to the wrong person

[4:18:58] markmclean24: 51% population has had its first dose in the UK
[4:19:06] Sphexs: There no research that shows that the Vaccine will protect. Its only likely that it will reduce severity of symptom and not lessen the ability for transmission.
[4:19:07] krajar96: @simplySylvan LUL
[4:19:13] jkitchin75: @Thoreya it will never be gone we will just learn to live with it like the flu
[4:19:19] MrGattz: @simplySylvan yeah the reply system is still dumb :P i got you haha
[4:19:33] Thoreya: @jkitchin75 im saying like we go back to normal
[4:19:45] dcorey416: probably boosters
[4:19:49] Swillis57: Some newer studies are suggesting that the Pfizer vaccine is about as effective at preventing asymptomatic infection as well, so there's some good news there
[4:19:54] Alphabetical13: i dont trust in the media or our gov
[4:19:55] Thunderbrew: A booster for other strains perhaps
[4:19:56] Sphexs: Will most likely become the new flu shot.
[4:19:56] markmclean24: @Sphexs Theres evidence/data showing it does
[4:19:58] Raidr211: it just hasnt been tested long enough to know if it really will help or not.
[4:20:00] BlueBeast33: I can almost guarantee you'll be getting boosters in the future
[4:20:08] jkitchin75: @Thoreya what is normal these days
[4:20:09] dcorey416: yup
[4:20:11] Kain4ever: @Towelliee I wanted to take the vaccine 2 weeks ago and my wife told me not to because her mother is a nurse and she talked to doctors saying the vaccine can cause many problems for pregnancy, but just last week we both got Covid so im like .... shitttt
[4:20:23] markmclean24: Thank the UK for finding the other varients
[4:20:24] rauko_64: talk is that it will be put in with the flu shot
[4:20:24] sneaksaway: @Towelliee physer shot has a 12 month life it is a yearly shot
[4:20:29] PYRO_MANI8C: i wont be taking it i had covid and it didnt even do anything to me but make me loose smell and have a headache for like a week it was a vacation for me being in lockdown lol
[4:20:35] Malarick: my guess is it will become part of the flu shot.  sort of a two birds one stone thing
[4:20:37] Seerated: COVID will probably be similar to seasonal flu from now on
[4:20:42] lurkbeee: back to finding a chat that isnt talking about covid ...
[4:20:52] dcorey416: bye
[4:20:58] MrGattz: @lurkbee yeah i know it.
[4:21:01] jkitchin75: @lurkbee bye
[4:21:06] PYRO_MANI8C: bye
[4:21:07] Sphexs: @Sphexs There isn't, there three ways vaccines work. There limited information that shows it grants immunity to catch it again like Heb B. It will most likely be similar to new flu shot.
[4:21:16] dibreno: the covid talk is annoying
[4:21:16] RobNXS: epic music for skinning

[4:28:57] firethelazor: dont u ever get burnt out towlely
[4:28:57] WhiteKnight74648: I really enjoy the gearing system in FFXIV. very simple. i can eventually get the best gear over months of gameplay where as a savage raider can get it alot sooner.
[4:29:08] Sandman_88: @Kromede KEKW I remember this haha
[4:29:22] laughing_octopus: ffxiv raid are 8 man
[4:29:29] Lilmistwuble: FF raiding is more prep, but it is still a better prospect tha n shadowlands.
[4:29:36] HeyitsMega: endgame gear is comprised of weekly currency (tombstone gear) and savage raid gear. So its very easy to catch up to current meta and geting into savage raiding
[4:29:43] HeyitsMega: for ffxiv that is
[4:30:00] Kromede: and he said "i'm a gaming expert, you can't tell me whats right" Sandman_88 lol
[4:30:20] cashaga: yeah i dunno either shadowlands been stale maybe new raid will be fun, we got diablo 4 at some point in time, ashes of creation, new world, just need something with a new frontier
[4:30:39] laughing_octopus: i would say savage is more like heroic
[4:30:42] Shrenko: I dont like how gearing works in FFXIV
[4:30:45] TheGaoSora: No pvp is good, makes classes fun
[4:30:52] TheGaoSora: *no pvp focus
[4:30:53] HeyitsMega: theres a special ULTIMATE savage tier for raids thats ment to be incredibly difficult
[4:31:02] laughing_octopus: @Shrenko gearing in ffxiv is bad
[4:31:10] Vashile: I'd love to see a new pvp mode in WoW. Like some sort of BR or something.
[4:31:20] Blynx: There still feels like there is alot to do to be fair
[4:31:33] Kromede: RIFT ofc

[4:31:49] Ldysansa: There is a lot todo in wow
[4:31:55] DesolaterTV: ultimate raids in ffxiv are extremly difficult as someone that cleared some
[4:31:56] Sandman_88: @TheOmniSora KEKW
[4:32:04] ChinnyD: as a wow player i went to FF during the last patch and found the raid too easy and lackluster in comparison to what wow has to offer
[4:32:17] TheGaoSora: F
[4:32:22] Kromede: oh deer
[4:32:30] Moronil: @ChinnyD savage raiding?
[4:32:31] Kromede: oh nose
[4:32:33] WhiteKnight74648: @ChinnyD was that the savage raid?
[4:32:34] Kromede: Kappa
[4:32:40] ChinnyD: yeah savage too
[4:32:44] Sandman_88: @ChinnyD probably alliance raids, ya.
[4:32:45] at1c: I would be playing Wildstar - in that reality it was never canceled.
[4:32:48] laughing_octopus: savage is a joke
[4:33:34] Kromede: i want to ask Bobby Kotick if he would buy Wildstar, dumb idea?

[4:33:48] EggwithEdges: I like FF14 crafting and gathering a lot
[4:33:54] DesolaterTV: in ULTIMATE raids at ffxiv if someone fucks up mechanics its probably gonna wipe the team in fight of 18 mins, what makes it much harder for me then wow raids
[4:34:00] cashaga: i just think the only games coming out with heart in the content is the indy games, but they are short, and large titles dont put heart into releases anymore costs to much time and money for return
[4:34:16] laughing_octopus: fxiv raids are disgustingly scripted
[4:34:23] Affiiance: Renown 40 on alts is super easy now
[4:34:35] laughing_octopus: one way to kill and thats it
[4:34:37] cashaga: shadowlands HYPE wasnt as big as the content
[4:34:56] Kromede: everything in a game is scripted
[4:35:24] spx_derivatives_trading: it was good as a pvper tbh
[4:35:25] DesolaterTV: they're scripted but the mechanics themselves have rng and diffrent jobs every time you do them again
[4:35:38] Shirey36: im a prot warrior i want bfa back!
[4:35:41] Vexxsis: @towelliee morning
[4:35:48] Lilmistwuble: enjoyed the video.  lot of home truths in it.
[4:35:50] RuineMi: @kromede it’s scripted to the point people have their rotation down to the gcd, everything happens at the exact same time everytime
[4:35:57] laughing_octopus: @Kromede ya right but not as much as savage fights
[4:36:04] MrEvilRex: Hey Towelliee not trying to stir up anything but why Wildstar die out? I really liked the graphics and theme of it.
[4:36:16] Lilmistwuble: I just don't think they can get the player base back this time.
[4:36:33] WhiteKnight74648: I feel the added difficulty to ff xiv is optimizing your rotations on your job.  I love the job design and there are few jobs that i do not enjoy.  I play the majority of them at level 80
[4:36:41] cashaga: its kinda like generic soda with brand new label shiny but still b rate product
[4:37:02] beckett3a: Blizz's wow dept is prolly thanking their stars for Classic TBC

[4:37:44] Affiiance: The fact they havent increased anima from WQs yet is disgusting for casual players
[4:37:44] Thunderbrew: Classic Cata will be good
[4:37:55] cashaga: trying to add some grind in wrong areas
[4:37:58] Lelomak: No ff14 today ?

[4:46:22] Affiiance: He said it in a video
[4:46:25] Zansteh: its his favorite exp tho
[4:46:39] BlueBeast33: Preach said the same thing about Classic and he ended up playing
[4:46:45] raymond3195: says he did it all before
[4:46:47] laughing_octopus: im sure he will play it
[4:46:50] Affiiance: He doesnt want to taint his past experience
[4:46:54] theoriginalzinng: he did go thru a whole thing in the video that makes sense
[4:47:01] Kromede: no it's not kevaly but if you get scammed blizzard can't help
[4:47:02] Koravd: He did play BC and its his favorite expansion

[4:47:38] Koravd: @Kromede Ohh thats what i wanted to know, ty!
[4:47:45] BlueBeast33: Literally all he's doing on SL right now is going through a bajillion alts leveling them, I don't see him doing that for 4 more months
[4:47:46] SkreamO_: what is the top addon bar?
[4:47:51] SkreamO_: that shows his xp
[4:48:14] GonoFPS: fact
[4:48:28] cashaga: played a dwarf warrior and learned to tank for my guild in kara, was so jelly of paladins aoe tanking
[4:48:30] metavahn231: preach is full of shit most of the time
[4:48:36] Thunderbrew: Do we care if Preach plays BC Classic or not?
[4:48:49] NovaSun84: "This experience isn't even the same, look at these Quality of Life things that make Classic untrue" BabyRage
[4:48:54] theoriginalzinng: im more worried about the current state of wow with meta and shit ruining bc for me
[4:48:54] Affiiance: @elixirfield1 what? WutFace
[4:49:03] jeneraljelly: Just let people play whatever they want who cares tbh
[4:49:04] BlueBeast33: I don't see how pre-nerf content taints the experience anyway
[4:49:05] D4zz3l: nova
[4:49:08] metavahn231: like in his video when he said casuals were gearing just fine in SL LUL
[4:49:13] EggwithEdges: @Towelliee Mob rooted attacks closest player
[4:49:16] OGxCarrot: When they are rooted, whoever is in melee range takes threat
[4:49:30] Shamwise: I really liked Un'goro
[4:49:37] OGxCarrot: Yea
[4:49:39] Koravd: @elixirfield1 When did he say that? Link it
[4:49:39] Kman3107: Most likely the mage has the threat reducing skill. So not weird at all that you get aggro :)
[4:50:06] GonoFPS: Kappa
[4:50:31] jerexify: @Towelliee Woooooooowww.... OK then.
[4:50:32] jerexify: lol
[4:50:36] metavahn231: it was the last part of his fresh characters video
[4:50:40] WhiteKnight74648: No. I recently got AOTC and i'm proud to call myself a casual
[4:50:44] NovaSun84: At 197 I can farm herbs and mines and kill random agroes easily enough.  I just can't do normal PvP RBGs, or Mythic raiding...
[4:50:52] sidd09: is this TbC
[4:50:58] WhiteTowerGaming: im late to the party, what druid spec are you going for tbc?
[4:51:05] Rudric_Ice: U CAN BUY aotc with 200k lmao
[4:51:33] sidd09: is this TBC?
[4:51:34] cashaga: i sold mythic boes and made 2million gold on launch
[4:51:54] cashaga: well heroic boes and world drop boes
[4:52:05] Armdel: you aare literally describing me lol

[4:53:12] jakeslol: it's okay Bobby kotick gets 200 mil bonus while the game suffers and they fire more people

[4:53:24] SonofHorus82: where'd that swag-ass new xp bar come from?
[4:53:38] Affiiance: You can just buy gear from the AH
[4:53:49] NovaSun84: Yup
[4:53:53] RocketMan23: covenant gear is easy catchup
[4:53:59] cerality: Grind anima for 197 gear though?
[4:54:02] Thoreya: Covenant gear is OP
[4:54:04] Thoreya: For alts
[4:54:09] Thoreya: Quick 197 gear
[4:54:14] lushu_2077: im ilvl 212 and its pretty much imposible to gear up higher without being carried
[4:54:16] bruhSit_farmer: i got so thirsty i ended up on classic
[4:54:20] Armdel: i had the problem at the start of the expansion where i had to spam normals to get that 1 item i needed to be able to queue into heroics
[4:54:22] bruhSit_farmer: nice one blizz
[4:54:27] Affiiance: Theres not enough Anima from WQs imo
[4:54:32] pipboy733: i hit 215 within a week of being 60 and never stepped into lfr
[4:54:35] Thunderbrew: My Resto Shaman is stuck at 206 item level.
[4:54:35] Rudric_Ice: why was m+ only fun when it was introduced in legion now it just sucks
[4:54:38] cashaga: just do normal mode raid and get 200 ilvl
[4:54:43] WhiteKnight74648: @pipboy733 how
[4:54:46] RocketMan23: you are lucky if you get a drop from lfr
[4:54:48] NovaSun84: I just go and piss off "the elites" in Normal PvP LULW  Honor farm ftw
[4:54:53] Exodeo_: And the Wqs are so damn annoying
[4:54:59] Sincline387: I did it on an alt
[4:55:00] RocketMan23: dude people hate pvp
[4:55:02] jerexify: @Towelliee I did on alts, but then I don't like PVP.
[4:55:03] nooge_time: i did it on alts
[4:55:04] idenkaz_: one piece of tmog 4-5k anima yeah f uk that KEKW
[4:55:09] Affiiance: Bring back BFA WQs
[4:55:11] Saphirosa_Dragonaspect: what am i supposed to do,when I'm bad at pvp? I want the spider mount so bad
[4:55:13] tbbex_: What are your thoughts on the Luxthos situation
[4:55:14] Thoreya: Venrukinjust made an alt mage and he even said covenant gear is much faster to 197 than pvp lol
[4:55:23] NovaSun84: The awesome part of Horde PvP is that you can queue as either horde or alliance
[4:55:25] etter00: Pvp is way faster
[4:55:29] Thoreya: Venruki*
[4:55:30] RocketMan23: ive used covenant gear on all my alts, its easy catchup
[4:55:43] Armdel: can't upgrade your gear if gear still isn't dropping
[4:55:53] Rudric_Ice: im at 220 ilvl just by pvping
[4:55:53] Juffrey: Covenant gear is definiely the way to go, its way too much honor wasted that you need to upgrade the covenant gear
[4:55:57] kroknows101: without raiding heroic or pvp, i'm stuck at 205-208 on 3 of my toons. Spent almost 2k anima upgraded M+ gear and got 1.5 item levels, it's not fun.
[4:55:58] Juffrey: conquest gear*
[4:55:58] beckett3a: gearing up in classic even while leveling feels so much more fulfilling than retail
[4:56:08] iunbearable: Anima gear was a joke.
[4:56:11] NovaSun84: Agreed OzusTeapot
[4:56:16] Vexxsis: sounds lame tbh
[4:56:20] cashaga: not anymore
[4:56:21] beckett3a: like a +3 int upgrade feels palpable when it means i can cast another shadowbolt before the mob dies
[4:56:28] neverbornlucky: my druid is stuck at 194
[4:56:28] stratiss: That's cause you feel the difference in power in classic.
[4:56:53] RunningOutOfRAM: I'm stuck at 220 :(
[4:56:58] Koravd: @elixirfield1 Just watched last 4 mins of the video and he never said that.. It's true that Preach response to what Fin said was terrible but he never said that
[4:57:08] Shrenko: Zelda!!
[4:57:09] NickLeonhearth: Stuck at 227 :(
[4:57:20] gargakan: winterspring is a cool zone

[4:58:14] stijn0416: 195 and havent played since december  lol
[4:58:33] TheGaoSora: Cute how pvp is rewarding muscle memory

[5:39:43] LSBreed: @towelliee the ending was 100000x better. Plus they made flash an actual character. I want to rewatch it, but from the perspective of flash has already been there.
[5:39:46] Coldfire989: They did Cyborge dirty in the theatrical one holy crap

[5:40:19] Wulfgrym: @theycallmecrapface they arrogantly thought they could catch up to marvel's popularity by rushing everything, Zack's OG version was properly laid out to give context and backstory to all the key characters and made them 100% more relatable and the story now flows properly

[5:40:30] NovaSun84: He's like Schwarzenneger back in the late 80s, early 90s... the huge muscle dude that can portray a larger than life male character
[5:40:31] snoopy123lol: man from uncle

[5:46:01] harpua12: yeah i'd prolly bear his children ngl
[5:46:03] Nico_vdM: Batman doesn't kill people he just breaks bones and puts henchmen in hospital for weeks

[5:58:50] CardinalTX: If they are smart they will milk it like Everquest    Start another progression server once at the end of WoTLK
[5:58:50] Gidger19: Do you think people over-play the newest expansions when they first come out and then they hate it after a while

[6:12:07] smashwow: yeah they're valor implementation is ass
[6:12:11] torvoltas: shouve bought pvp crap
[6:12:21] Bwyllin_: I want to play retail but the gear stuff just puts me off
[6:12:22] Frostfury: Just git gud get a team together saves you money :P
[6:12:33] imallin1234: Sound like me in bfa lmao I did mythics for 2 months straight didn’t get a weapon drop
[6:12:34] Wulfgrym: valor i don't think is garbage, the inability to ungrade existing gear is bullshit
[6:12:34] Gorestack: the vault is still the only way to get upgrades and it fucking sucks
[6:12:36] swordwindgaming: valor point system is supposed to encourage more m+ runs, but it can't coexist alongside arena system
[6:12:37] SethSteckler: a +15 cost 500k gold?
[6:12:56] Kinghorn: hammer squad the new devilsaur mafia
[6:12:57] Sollice: my weapons are 194. I CAN NOT get an upgrades. 3 weeks of normal and heroic NO DH usable amps have dropped and couple of dozen m+ NOTHING
[6:12:59] fiingerz: wow my ksm cost me 1.5m
[6:13:16] jerexify: @Towelliee Turn left!
[6:13:17] Vurisa: you went past it
[6:13:30] Wulfgrym: The only way it can co-exist is their is a valor vendor and you can buy the piece of gear you want for X valor
[6:13:31] faxity97: @Sollice i feel you, i did 12 PF yesterday for the wep
[6:13:45] metavahn231: isnt the problem with blizzard is while they are big its mostly artists?
[6:13:51] Sollice: it's really disheartening
[6:13:53] TheNextKing306: with the loot being so scarce I appreciate there is something in place to boost the bis item I got on a lower lvl key
[6:14:03] faxity97: @Sollice and it didnt drop btw
[6:14:04] Exodeo_: I've decided to give classic a proper go since Ir eally can't enjoy retail atm
[6:14:05] metavahn231: like blizzard are just bad at balancing their systems
[6:14:10] jerexify: I got KSC, and that's all I'm doing. I'm not gonna kill myself to get KSM, especially since the gear drop-rate sucks anyways.
[6:14:19] TheNextKing306: agree its still not enough tuo
[6:14:19] Sollice: I have yet to see that sword drop EVER
[6:14:28] Mecabeast: it is way more time consuming to farm valor compared to honor/conquest
[6:14:29] TiredCarcass: now that makes sense
[6:14:35] mwchaos: Hey @Towelliee great vid, I enjoyed it a lot. I know another thing that is really bothersome for the mythic raiders is that since main stat is so insanely strong for dps classes for insance, you get to a point where there is literally no loot that is an upgrade for you outside of slg/danny loot and that requires reclearing slg, which we all know sucks.
[6:14:38] Kisswani: Hi chat
[6:14:39] PvtHudson093: let me buy the piece of gear i want from a vendor
[6:14:45] faxity97: imma do another 10 b4 reset but man i dont want to
[6:14:50] frastly: i thought this is TBC stream not retail :(
[6:14:52] Malarick: agreed.  Towelliee for Game Director!
[6:14:53] mrpresbaby: What about a vendor for M+ gear so we don't have to refarm?
[6:14:56] Vexxsis: and ppl wonder why classic is booming more, it just works
[6:14:58] SethSteckler: why remove the achievement requirement?
[6:15:03] smashwow: mid tier this implementation is god awful, they didn't retro the upgrades. they limited pve to ONE currency, and they need to give M+ at 18+ a 226 option.

[6:15:10] Zeijun: open bag, use carcass, then pheremones
[6:15:20] Wulfgrym: @Towelliee you have a bag in your inventory
[6:15:20] metavahn231: isnt the achiev just for the highest ilvl?
[6:15:32] SilkeySmooth: blizzard needs a valor vendor like they did in bfa when they added the vendor
[6:15:38] Sollice: no. one for 5 one for 10 one for 15
[6:15:45] smashwow: @elixirfield1 ^
[6:15:47] Pufendorf99: isnt it blinkin g?
[6:15:54] metavahn231: so why are casuals trying to get 15s
[6:15:59] Sollice: so 15 is to the highest 226?Valor upgrade
[6:16:14] legobind: its the slab of meat in your bags
[6:16:14] Zeijun: carcass is in inventory
[6:16:15] Gregadeaux: look at your ingame chat fam
[6:16:16] Sollice: because that maybe their only way of getting 226
[6:16:17] metavahn231: should just be happy with 10s
[6:16:21] Gregadeaux: preserved threshadon meat
[6:16:41] smashwow: @Sollice currently 15s = upgrade 220 gear
[6:16:42] Gregadeaux: apply that seduction gland
[6:16:43] Gregadeaux: oh yeah
[6:16:46] swordwindgaming: 10s is 213. 15s is 220.
[6:17:04] Wulfgrym: it is
[6:17:04] Moobot: Check out Towelliee's latest Youtube video! https://youtu.be/U8-64zqVa8k Shadowlands needs some help
[6:17:15] moobsjones: !YT
[6:17:20] TheNextKing306: I missed the actual intelligent conversations between towlliee and the hammer squad, good to be back in here
[6:17:46] metavahn231: 15s is alot of effort for only 220 wtf lol
[6:17:52] TheNextKing306: best twitch chat around
[6:17:55] smashwow: but i feel like to give M+ that final "we're endgame like the devs said we would be when they rolled out M+ in legion" 18s or 20s should give you the option to upgrade to 226
[6:18:09] Gregadeaux: achievement system probably would have worked if valor came out with the expansion release
[6:18:24] pemadsen17: what is the point of the heroic raid if you can grind low-level Mythic plus until you're 220 + Gear?
[6:18:29] swordwindgaming: pve loot system is just fugged in general, it needs a near-complete overhaul
[6:18:33] smashwow: i feel like giving out free 220 gear isn't good either though.
[6:19:02] wupixlol: Maybe bring pvp power or equivlant back so pvp gear is pvp specific?
[6:19:08] Sollice: @Towelliee Do you plan on playing Outriders on release or are you going to give it a few to make sure its not an Anthem 2.0
[6:19:20] Gorestack: just another time sink like every other fucking system they've implemented lately
[6:19:27] Lazugo: @Sollice Yes solice 24hrs too
[6:19:28] smashwow: put in a vendor with valor then let us build up justice like it was waaaay back in the day. @Towelliee attach it to heroics or whatever just like random bgs
[6:19:41] metavahn231: 15s isnt something most players just breeze through

[6:20:14] TheNextKing306: canadians last longer
[6:20:27] TheNextKing306: just saying
[6:20:48] metavahn231: the achiev + grinding valor thats way more work than heroic raid
[6:21:07] apollobaker: @towelliee no dungeon boosting, Iam proud
[6:21:43] mrpresbaby: will there be a different KSM for next season?
[6:22:13] kharnij83: with this valor addition now til new patch make the mythic drops like legion where u were getting AT least 1 piece for +2 or 3ing  a key
[6:22:20] Deekan33: Deekan33 subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 48 months! 
[6:22:30] Vexxsis: yeah boosting is lame
[6:22:40] Stonefather: I mean, it's for people who want to AFK and catch up on missed TV Show episodes
[6:22:47] Stonefather: Keepo
[6:22:51] metavahn231: they will scale the M+ up though and make it just as hard
[6:22:56] swordwindgaming: Imagine Blizzard upping KSM by +1 every season reset.
[6:23:01] stratiss: You'll have to get the achievement again though if thats what you're asking.
[6:23:08] stratiss: Cause KSM is seasonal.
[6:23:17] Stonefather: Will mages still work?
[6:23:18] Vexxsis: that's understandable @towelliee
[6:23:25] Stonefather: Because of AoE changes
[6:23:37] old_zool: do you level faster in prepatch?
[6:23:46] Stonefather: After level 20 you level 15% faster per level
[6:23:49] metavahn231: leveling is easy with tbc talents
[6:23:57] NovaSun84: Did they indicate when that 1 lvl 58 character will be popped into TBC?  In Prepatch, or at launch
[6:24:11] Stonefather: I assume at launch of prepatch the boost will be live
[6:24:23] SonofHorus82: I'm actually considering not doing a Paladin but doing a priest instead. The guild is going to have an influx of tanks, but probably not so much for healers.
[6:24:24] legobind: yeah i am waiting for the prepatch to lvl my pally
[6:24:38] CrispyNugs: ya can't boost new races
[6:24:42] legobind: got it to 15 and it almost put me to sleep like 9 times
[6:24:56] CrispyNugs: so I wonder if most re rolls are gonna boost non new race pallys
[6:25:06] SwedishfishTV: lol
[6:25:08] Kinghorn: but, why no paladin
[6:25:11] Wulfgrym: REEE
[6:25:15] Kinghorn: coxDerp

[6:25:26] HotHotHeals: watch the slow mount speed gives me nostalgia
[6:25:47] Riggoz1: @Towelliee your youtube video was spot on
[6:25:50] Stonefather: Also gear looks subjectively better on Blood Elves
[6:25:53] NovaSun84: oh weren't they giving the Human paladin the same aura that made BE OP?
[6:25:55] metavahn231: ill be draenai shaman, ally need help lol
[6:26:01] swordwindgaming: I remember during TBC when horde bitched in unison about human racial so hard that Blizzard broke it.

[6:28:50] TiredCarcass: what i learned that I forgot everything is farther leveling in classic
[6:28:58] Kinghorn: its 7 zones
[6:28:59] t_800_i: what?

[6:36:04] FerociouzMonk: 5 years later Kappa
[6:36:16] Vexxsis: made lvling for 1-60 a little better if I remember also
[6:36:30] goodjuicy: @Towelliee If I start leveling now can I still hit 60 before TBC comes out?
[6:36:31] themaliciousrabbit: @Bleusempai Do a bit of research about atunements honestly. Need a lot of attunements for the raids and dungeons so it would be good to have that in mind while levleing
[6:36:32] Vexxsis: nothing significant though
[6:36:38] AirmVn: I wonder why do they give boosts to people with lvl 60 already ?
[6:36:43] D3m0nHunt3r666: Felwood
[6:36:44] shocky_324: felwood
[6:36:45] AirmVn: wouldn't that be abused ?
[6:36:46] Theduskflyer: Shit, 1-60 tbc leveling is still pretty rough. Lol
[6:36:46] TheLastRace: @Towelliee WPL or Winterspring
[6:36:47] D3m0nHunt3r666: or plaguelands :p

[6:37:11] metavahn231: in tbc

[6:37:13] Moobot: Check out Towelliee's latest Youtube video! https://youtu.be/U8-64zqVa8k Shadowlands needs some help
[6:37:19] TheUnknowing: its 1 boost and you have to buy it lol
[6:37:21] zuna1904: and it will be COSTLY
[6:37:23] Vexxsis: hopefully dual spec is coming
[6:37:28] NovaSun84: oh FeelsBadMan
[6:37:32] CrusaderNero: LUL you gotta pay for that? HAH
[6:37:36] ackrite4891: im ok with the boost if it bolsters the population
[6:37:36] chrslp: $40-60 prolly LUL
[6:37:36] Essysham: noooo Blizzard would obviously give us something like that for FREE
[6:37:38] FatChase: Reee no free boost
[6:37:40] AirmVn: I mean, they said they have the boost for new players
[6:37:42] Layercake: teftLewd free and Blizzard in the same sentence ?
[6:37:43] NovaSun84: I thought it was included with TBC launch LULW
[6:37:45] JonnyFivesAlive: worth it
[6:37:49] Sonatta: a lot of people think it's free
[6:37:50] Moonori: other streamers just assume everyone will pay 60$ for a boost
[6:37:54] AirmVn: to catch up, then why does everyone have it
[6:38:01] Essysham: Blizzard wouldn't exploit something that tons of people want for money!
[6:38:02] Vexxsis: @lebaston I'm confused by your statement
[6:38:10] Theduskflyer: 39.95$
[6:38:17] proph_000: the boost also can't be used on a blood elf or dranei toon
[6:38:19] Thunderlops: Worth the $ 😂
[6:38:25] zuna1904: i rather dont play than spend 60...
[6:38:26] NovaSun84: oh wait
[6:38:37] FerociouzMonk: lvl with the fastest class boost the slowest/boring class to lvl = gg
[6:38:40] NovaSun84: I'll just farm that money on retail tokens...
[6:38:43] zuna1904: it better be max 25
[6:38:43] TiredCarcass: weekend

[7:22:25] CDubTheRIPper: imagine being a vanilla raider leader today LUL
[7:22:31] CritcobainTV: @Towelliee Luxthos was talking shit about him in the key apparently, and then after the guy left the key, his community talked shit to him to the point where the guy had to change his in game name
[7:22:32] Stonefather: Nowadays we have to write a twitlonger apologizing
[7:22:33] NickLeonhearth: "Thanks for putting me back in my place." oh my god...

[7:22:38] Wildside1177: @CDubTheRIPper No way. When you apologize they own you. Stand up to the woke mob.
[7:22:55] TheGaoSora: Also why is he leveling a warrior again? o.O
[7:22:59] Secondbreakfasttt: He did preety much the same
[7:23:00] Vexxsis: @theszoti I think one of the biggest things is people take shit way out of context and twist things around
[7:23:08] jak_gaming: @Towelliee the Snowflake melter

[7:23:12] CDubTheRIPper: thats a little different then
[7:23:14] Shrenko: retail is just full of toxic people
[7:23:15] Vanhoek: Good the assholes that leave keys should be flamed to death

[7:24:47] denflup: sell it before BC
[7:24:51] SonofHorus82: The problem isnt the streamer and Lux was right for calling out a toxic player. 9 times out of 10 the issue lies with the community that thinks they have to be the white knight and come to the streamers defense.
[7:24:52] blade_killa: feelsbadman
[7:24:54] Mitune: inb4 classic Cata when it sells lol

[7:25:57] Squ1d_tv: if I'm alliance and want to play shaman for TBC is there a way to level in vanilla early? or do I just have to wait and for launch and do 1-70?
