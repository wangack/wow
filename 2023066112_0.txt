[1:33:23] KaiBloodtalon: WildStar is a game I genuinely miss. I hate not being able to play it.
[1:33:47] Shuttlelol: theyd just need to fix 40 man raiding/difficulty

[1:39:24] Masqerader: *didn't
[1:39:39] Alsparq: probably the best game to ever fail
[1:40:05] jbeastb: AND the art style was good and the graphics were set up to "stand the test of time" much in the same way wow's has
[1:40:27] mavericks312: it was just poorly designed
[1:40:39] jbeastb: I don't agree
[1:40:43] kreff_: I don’t know, I checked it out but it didn’t captivate me that much, story wasn’t appealing
[1:40:44] jbeastb: I liked it's design
[1:40:53] TheUnknowing: the difficulty/attunement etc with the original release just turned people away
[1:41:10] kreff_: I need the story do drive the rest imo
[1:41:47] jbeastb: they were tricked into thinking a 40 man raid type mmo was desired and paid for it
[1:42:41] LazyUncleGaming: i still feel everyone saw jagex doing the original Runescape deal, and went "maybe we can do that."and so wow and aion released "classic" servers

[1:43:04] Masqerader: wildstar was the dreamcast of MMOs
[1:43:07] PigPenLen: Good evening T and chat! towHAMUP Hope all is well
[1:43:07] TheUnknowing: i think the only reason classic WoW was as successful as it was and as it has been is just because of nostalgia
[1:43:11] Zapp_Brannigan86: talking wow rumble?
[1:43:30] DailyDisclosure: Jeremy Gaffney
[1:43:35] TheUnknowing: nah wildstar @Zapp_Brannigan86
[1:44:01] LazyUncleGaming: i mean, i started on classic because i will admit to being a legion baby. i wanted to see what the "good ol days" were people liked ot go on about.
[1:44:03] Shuttlelol: @TheUnknowing i wouldn't say just nostalgia; i think WoW classic is a genuinely beautifully designed game + its easy as hell making it super accessible. plus i think releasing as the pandemic hit helped a lot
[1:44:18] Zapp_Brannigan86: Ah well i mean classic anything is gonna bet hard on nostalgia lol
[1:44:54] TheUnknowing: Well sure, but nostalgia has to be a huge factor with it. I love classic as much as the next guy but a lot of it for me was certainly nostalgia
[1:45:02] Shuttlelol: the hoverboard mount in wildstar is still unmatched to this day
[1:45:17] TheUnknowing: hoverboard was amazing
[1:46:03] Zapp_Brannigan86: @TheUnknowing rly tho whatever reason people play it is irrelevant if the game is being played. They dont care why you play it and obviously people be playing it lol
[1:46:24] TheUnknowing: for sure, I mean im playing the shit out of SoD @Zapp_Brannigan86
[1:46:24] Moobot: towHAMUP Follow Towelliee on twitter so you can be in the know at all times! | twitter.com/towelthetank towKawaii

[1:47:14] Zapp_Brannigan86: SoD is the most fun ive had in wow in a while. Right up there with when wotlk classic came out
[1:47:44] TheUnknowing: Yeah same, ive had tons of fun with it so far and look forward to remaining phases
[1:48:41] Shuttlelol: their feedback during raid testing beta was insane
[1:48:48] ambiotic: they wanted it to be hardcore and thought that the mistake wow made was going more casual and boy that was a mistake
[1:48:49] Moobot:  Towelliee.com has all of your Towelliee news WoW UI addon information, and merchandise collection. Check it out!
[1:48:56] TheUnknowing: yeah, wildstar is just an unfortunate thing at the end of the day
[1:49:12] ashton_youbooty: i hit max level in wildstar but couldn't get the attunements done for the raids so i stopped playing
[1:49:22] Shuttlelol: they basically spat on the world first guilds from WoW who beta tested their raids
[1:49:26] jbeastb: F2P is the way to go 100%
[1:49:26] ambiotic: i know the source code is out there now
[1:49:40] TheUnknowing: i loved wildstar leveling
[1:50:27] TheUnknowing: think new world has been the only exception with how long it took originally, for me atleast.
[1:50:41] SaiyanGodX_Ano: SaiyanGodX_Ano subscribed with Prime.

[1:52:55] ambiotic: i would do it in a game that was super fun the whole way thru, the problem with wildstar is it got sooooooo boring in the middle levels. ESO is really the only game in which questing feels pretty good at all times
[1:53:28] ambiotic: its free to play but the guy has the first zone in only, so you can do about 20 levels then its over

[1:53:30] Shuttlelol: i got 50 the first weekend the game came out; i remember feeling ultra sick by the end of that grind. never again
[1:53:57] jbeastb: I feel like someone should just buy wildstar and relaunch it... it would be a cheap way to get a high quality MMO on the market... it just needs a little TLC and a F2P model
[1:53:59] TheUnknowing: yeah as much as I loved the original wildstar leveling, it was a huge grindd
[1:54:27] ambiotic: that is why i only lasted a few months
[1:54:31] ambiotic: the attunements
[1:54:52] Shuttlelol: didnt you need to get attuned to 5 man heroics too? i vaguely remember that shit
[1:55:02] Pearsi: yep
[1:55:22] ambiotic: 40 man raids at the start was the single dumbest thing of all time

[1:56:04] xo_navi: They eventually pretty much reworked all of it

[2:00:09] Shuttlelol: @trivotix they have a few times now i believe
[2:00:47] trivotix: Yeah, from what I read they were not that big of a nerf though
[2:01:13] Shuttlelol: boss prob needs a orbital nuke nerf

[3:29:29] pecotime: ok
[3:29:58] Molvonos: It's difficult to create a raid environment to push the hardest content if the number of raiders fluctuates, which also increases/decreases HP and damage values.

[3:38:48] TheUnknowing: super easy to gear these days @highonexd
[3:39:19] highonexd: @TheUnknowing @TheUnknowing thanks for the info. I've been on a Destiny 2 kick and it's getting stale. Might have to get back to my roots
[3:39:49] TheUnknowing: @highonexd No problem, retail is in the best state its been in in some time, especially when it comes to gearing.

[3:42:09] jmalmin: If your a healer your good to go :) or a warlock everyone wants a warlock
[3:45:04] highonexd: it definitely is (from my memory). had to spam a lot more lower level mythics to get a raid invite in BoA
