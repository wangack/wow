[1:03:00] CyonDru: all I will say
[1:03:33] happierfeet_: @Frieren93 when i worked without having an education in eu i had no vacation
[1:03:39] Frieren93: @jdotb  u think theres an amount of avoidance/vers classes should bring to keys like 28 and higher?
[1:03:54] happierfeet_: 6 weeks paid vacation isnt universal
[1:03:59] CyonDru: @Frieren93 my last job i was at for years and p high up in management and only got 18 days paid off not counting several sick days. at my current job i only get 14 days of PTO
[1:04:20] Frieren93: @Frieren93 oh rip
[1:04:37] caradea_: "sick days" are also a pretty weird concept
[1:04:52] CyonDru: yep and i dont even get those here lmao
[1:05:01] caradea_: thats criminal
[1:05:02] Frieren93: @jdotb  i think about playing hutner and vers is one of the worst stats there. but as u know, hunters are squishy af
[1:05:16] CyonDru: the pay is good dont get me wrong but current PTO i get sucks balls
[1:05:31] caradea_: are you able to take unpaid days off?

[4:11:31] Whitewolf1441: i feel like this boss has too many mechanics, a cleave, a soak, an aoe, a dot, and thats just phase 1!
[4:12:02] Xenorphz: yea this guy is basically a raid boss
[4:12:18] Xenorphz: tyr is a chad afterall
[4:12:27] Whitewolf1441: at least make him a real raid boss
[4:13:12] HeIIaAverage: They went over the top with this mega dungeon. Both sides are bad imo. Only reason fall isn't perceived that way is the timer.
