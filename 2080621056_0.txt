[3:14:10] MelodyRx: why listen to podcast when the hot tub section of twitch exists
[3:14:10] matt_caste: I literally listen to one, and i feel redeemed because it was so good it got picked up and turned into a tv series. And it was no opinion influencer stuff, it was deep dives into the evolution of old world lore
[3:14:11] xSoulstacex: I guess it's a different type of content. I like listening to similar things when doing dishes or driving ykno? Things for when you cant commit full attention

[5:08:11] Keylightz: does replicating shadows not work in pvp anymore or what? doesnt seem to do 2 targets
[5:08:11] rembrandt89: Gotta be in the right mindset for it that's for sure
[5:08:24] MelodyRx: dialed in
[5:08:27] larrydavidtherogue: connected to all

[5:08:56] mohammedalmeqbali1: bro if u quit smoking then i guess u gotta quit drinking as its nothin better i guess
[5:08:58] Knaxxis: it’s all about the environment and ur mindset.
[5:08:59] GoSolarASAP: damn Pika in the flannel now
[5:09:03] Darkminst: probably the deepest Pika cuts i have ever heard
[5:09:05] bigkcp: when you truly stop caring what people think of you, this is when you truly learn you
[5:09:07] Knaxxis: doing it by yourself is no bueno
[5:09:08] redeyeguy420: so wha t happened was chemical imbalance and your brain was cooking so you saw and thought crazy things. you don't find god on drugs or happiness you will only trick yourself into thinking your okay or making it. doing mind altering drugs is all a front
[5:09:08] therealthracian: thats the best way to do it
[5:09:11] GoSolarASAP: are we crunk yet?
[5:09:11] sage_yu: sounds wicked

[5:09:43] sage_yu: LOL
[5:09:45] ty_usa: Night pika! take it ez man

[5:10:01] sage_yu: mfs have ego deaths doing that shit
[5:10:03] projecthd: weed can bring out mental illness tho
[5:10:05] redeyeguy420: people saying that doing that drugs open their mind are idiots making excuses for being a loser ngl
[5:10:08] larrydavidtherogue: I realised that the illusion of self was born from thoughts and experience and arose dependently of previous phenomena. There was no single identifiable self, just the universe. had immense sympathy/love for all living beings
[5:10:11] YonzoMusashi: depends on genetics too
[5:10:12] GoodGriffey: I had a friend who had a psychotic break from micro dosing for years. Covid lockdowns happened and he had to do that shit alone in his house... he lost his mind completely it was crazy

[5:10:26] lazyturtle0824: I had a friend in high school trip on acid and was arrested walking down the highway naked
[5:10:28] Knaxxis: I prefer shrooms
[5:10:32] blunn0: I got you but like when youre not in the best place sometims you need to be smokin weed and drinkin to escape
[5:10:34] kniftty: its so funny seeing all these podcasters and some comedians promoting/talking about microdosing the last few years

[5:10:46] therealthracian: LOL
[5:10:47] GoSolarASAP: you usually get PERMAFRIED from benzos though like xanax etc.   LSD trips over and over will destroy your brains in a different way, they become schizo almost it's crazy
[5:10:50] Johnykarate: what about aaron rodgers he micro doses

[5:11:02] YonzoMusashi: my family has history of schizophrenia and it definitely triggers it
[5:11:05] Knaxxis: pills r the real problem tbh
[5:11:06] YonzoMusashi: scariest thing to ever exp
[5:11:12] zoxzap: you can learn some crazy things about yourself and the world in general from it but i feel like its generally best done for a relatively short period of your life, not for a long time
[5:11:13] twoyearstardy: weed is on the same page as shrooms no?
[5:11:19] GoSolarASAP: bad friend group = bad future
[5:11:25] ostreidiis: yeah its something to do when you young
[5:11:26] bigkcp: do it with a shaman not with your mates :P
[5:11:29] Griff_666: @twoyearstardy Hell no
[5:11:29] kniftty: @twoyearstardy not really
[5:11:30] Knaxxis: weed isn’t like shrooms at all lol

[5:12:32] GoSolarASAP: @pvalue01 then it will. what you think about before you go into it will 100% happen. bad trips happen because of a bad feeling about how the trip will go.

[5:12:46] bigkcp: my childhood wat eating eccy burgers and mushroom soups for breakfast, not worth the setback, use your youth to get ahead
[5:12:56] dudeman42022: no matter good or bad trip you’ll learn something about yourself especially if it’s your first time

[5:25:09] GoSolarASAP: why don't you write off the m340i payments tho? you're 1099, that's the purpose of leasing - to write off the payment
[5:25:10] crazycorgis: do you track those cars at all

[5:27:19] akro_13: ur gonna mod it even tho its a lease?
[5:27:25] shadowwrogue: Really great performance guys gg only question in have is why dont try sp rogue hpal against warrior/DH ?

[5:28:21] sage_yu: LOL
[5:28:23] Nicohan95: GTRs are already bulletproof

[5:28:42] rembrandt89: were you sold on the gt3 right away or did you think about the turbo s at all
[5:28:42] Nicohan95: mustangs are 400 wheel bro
[5:28:46] chefboirw33d: @Pikabooirl dodge demon way better than a gtr
[5:28:47] GrimShady99: pika, you should get the car that buff guy from fast and furious hass

[5:28:56] coolless12312: gas guzzlers is crazy
[5:28:59] Jaedarr: upgrading the transmission on those cars gets so expensive
[5:29:00] coolless12312: tesla gang
[5:29:05] i_Static: he's about to snooze isn't he
[5:29:09] wxgyu: Which one is your favorite to drive
[5:29:10] GoSolarASAP: damn, my M5  can handle like 700awhp easy
[5:29:12] drfeltgood: Hella old..

[5:29:57] twoyearstardy: no tesla in cali?
[5:30:02] GoSolarASAP: and it's not like you're gonna do launch control from every stop light
[5:30:09] sage_yu: of course

[5:33:23] illEvan11_11: El manuel is bis
[5:33:27] GoSolarASAP: @petercray don't see a point in spending 250k on a car and getting a manual just to say you got a manual. PDK shifts like 500ms faster and having to deal with a manual in city streets is annoying as fuck, just gonna burn the clutch and never wanna drive the car.

[5:59:59] moldybread00: chasing badges defeats the purpose of getting something like a gtr tho- the whole point of the GTR is value [relatively]
[6:00:05] RmxWOW: it's good to have that mindset to an extent because it enables that grind but it's a double edged sword
[6:00:12] oldironforgy: Have to get a Daytona bro, thats all you need

[6:02:03] Altiair29: putting effort into yourself shows you can put effort into someone/something else
[6:02:08] djdranzer: idk...if I had a huge wang id be pretty happy

[6:18:39] izanagh1: im dead
[6:18:39] eleblastnaga: @optional_advice that is what pissed me off the most. The Doordarshan menu would have $19 for a meal but the receipt would have $12 on it. So that on top of delivery and tip makes it 30 bucks before you get it. I think it should be illegal for them to hike the menu price tho
[6:18:52] eleblastnaga: Doordash*
[6:18:58] izanagh1: @Chay525 ur not realll lmaao
[6:19:05] ItsRoxasXD: @izanagh1 as a 20 yr old get off twitch yeah civz is right
[6:19:07] optional_advice: @izanagh1 figure out as quickly as you can what you want to do in your life. the quicker you figure it out the quicker you can make strides to get it done
