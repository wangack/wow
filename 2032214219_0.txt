[2:19:42] Warenz: @PNZTK So i guess the flamestrike hybrid build is the best? since im doing 20's and not higher, is spamming flamestrike the play then?
[2:19:47] bingbongsanchez22: Chatting
[2:20:44] PNZTK: @Warenz yeah well it depends on what you mean by "better", it'll be better at doing more overall damage for sure

[4:19:08] Azerous1219: @aneas I was wondering the same thing, this is an interesting, new comp. I'm pretty stoked aug doesn't seem to be required anymore

[4:20:15] Trif0ld: thats a number from max
[4:20:18] Trif0ld: he has 7-12%
[4:20:18] Gormsh: it’s not a number outta his ass it’s know aug is 8-12% loss
[4:20:25] Craven__: Wasn't me that came up with that number but r1 riot players
[4:20:27] r3mix4: r3mix4 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 11 months!

[4:21:31] tvilk: oh yeah surely the r1 rio players say that classic go look at ranking rn and see all the augs
[4:21:38] Azerous1219: I imagine aug is a liability in WCT

[4:22:55] GorieI: How can you give a number for performance of a class when there is so many things other than DPS that affect on the runs performance?
[4:23:00] Craven__: Bro you have proof infront of your eyes it's not good by the fact these guys aren't playing it in a 30
[4:23:21] tvilk: @Craven__ https://raider.io/mythic-plus-rankings/season-df-3/all/world/leaderboards-strict
[4:23:25] tvilk: have fun looking
[4:23:45] capac_77: play game for game friends
[4:24:10] rebeusauvage12: @GorieI it's based on stats, and augs make huge pulls viable thats why you can complete 30s with augs even if theyre 7-12% less dps efficient than another dps class
[4:24:57] Craven__: Okay ask gingi after this run why they aren't playing it and I bet he will say its not good from a dps stand point
[4:25:03] Trif0ld: well lots of keys are bricked from lack of survive instead of lack of dps so having an aug helps with that
[4:25:11] GorieI: @GorieI I'm not saying Aug is really good for high M+. I'm just questioning this number that is given for performance when there are insane amount of vartiables
[4:25:14] Craven__: You take Aug to live

[4:25:33] GorieI: @GorieI not saying aug isn't*
[4:25:41] Azerous1219: @capac_77 very fair point, but unfortunately people are slaves to the meta and even in 18s, 20s, and 22s people will imitate/demand the same comps they see in runs like this. Stupid? Yes. But here we are.
[4:25:52] Gormsh: gingi just got back from vacay KEKW

[4:45:29] Jesper2370: If you think of a solo mage POV. How would you do, in order to improve on your own? Keep in mind, i do 20+ key's @GingiTV

[4:45:51] inspirox: ye avoid for the 23's that take 6 mins -.- vaLuE
[4:45:53] syrikk: i think the traditional mdi format needs a shake up. maybe drop the head to head, bu tkeep it lower keys and about time.
[4:45:55] itachiikun33: can you just play with aug @GingiTV
[4:45:57] Wujoh: just terts that drop naturally like live servers, no
[4:45:59] syrikk: so TGP but about time rather than level.
[4:46:08] Nocturne118: Mandatory messing that vortex run screwed last tgp Sadge

[4:48:58] Jesper2370: Is it better to go ignite, over flamestrike for bursting weeks? I feel like i can't "control", the pace they mbos are dying?

[6:28:03] VesperalTV: #stayverbal

[6:29:57] atticusfinch99: It is how they are, nerf and elle bicker all the time but they are often joking.
[6:30:07] kallisz: i mean not talking for 10 min when ur main shotcaller
[6:30:22] qtceef: @butter51 that they Timed The key. Sure they Timed it but its more of how nerf act thats The issue. He was The one low key jumping on elles etc
[6:30:29] ubba90: comparing you 5 to them 5 they are perfectionist to a degree where they get very high tention and tilt badly. you 5 are perfectionist and will screw something up and laugh and go again. they tilt much easier than yall. and nerf always seems to take it a step further about the problems

[6:31:08] StillStormX: i watch them all the time and ill just say this, no one says anything because elle asks us not to, but nerf cries like a bitch 25/8, literally nothing new

[6:35:11] basherbash32: @Felket I mean if they are making good money like Echo and Liquid I understand. Nerf is a content streamer.
[6:35:11] mespe: @GingiTV du kan clear en keybind, ved at macro ghostly strike + echoing reprimand sammen. Du bruger alligevel dem begge som generator, og ghostly strike har ingen gcd
[6:35:12] homixidew: @GingiTV Is Keep it rolling Really that better or i just little better than other build

[6:36:44] jairogue: @BruhItsKoda1 I mean, if you play right you never end up with only 1 buff with new 4p
[6:36:45] kallisz: good mod, hate seeing people use a condition as insult
[6:36:49] MissAvantasia: I warned ya
[6:37:07] qtceef: @kallisz pretty sure he cheated on The pull before they overlap stuns. They overlap on The maggot pull inside The room if i remember correctly

[6:45:02] Lockdwn_1: You dont really use ambush as KIR spec right?
[6:45:06] burbe: yea normal
[6:45:13] lynariah: you dont use ambush with this build at all
[6:45:15] Deafyx: you dont use ambush in KIR
[6:45:19] maddershunt: clikz has been on all week with meeres nawoh and kenn
[6:45:23] BruhItsKoda1: Gotta be very efficient with KiR
[6:45:24] burbe: bte
[6:45:29] LuxX_qt: macro it into everything
[6:45:31] LuxX_qt: gg
[6:45:38] spaeltchenbtw: Yea did the same
[6:45:38] jasonicusm4: @GingiTV when would you lust on the last boss in Rise?
[6:45:42] Wujoh: its a very slight dps loss but its less mental tax so its a trade off
[6:45:44] Neyebae: @maddershunt You're thinking of Canexx right?
[6:45:52] hennfps: i wouldnt macro it to dispatch it just consumes energy so much
[6:46:03] Nuitsible: yeah canexx is not clikz
[6:46:05] MindhackerTV: did u macroed your trinkets with somehting xD?
[6:46:13] aliziatwo: macro it into sinister strike and er only I believe is the way jpc does it
[6:46:17] maddershunt: yeah maybe my bad
[6:46:25] dxpain: @GingiTV james said he only does macro it to SS and ER but not BtE
[6:46:25] Lockdwn_1: yeah no ambush in KIR spec Gingi
[6:46:27] burbe: yea
[6:46:33] lynariah: KIR build compared to HO  -doesn't use ambush -is more cp efficient withpistol shot usage has to use echoing reprimand. and KIR itself has an additional reroll logic after pressing KIR (see faq) is more punishing if you mess up builder priority (can't just slam sinister strike, have to pay attention to BF cooldown etc.)
[6:46:39] burbe: remove ambush
[6:46:46] Whanger: @GingiTV I saw some rogue guy say you dont even use ambush while in stealth just sinister strike with this build
[6:46:54] Deafyx: You dont ambush in KiR spec @GingiTV
[6:46:57] TakkaZJ2: yeah only SS gingi
[6:47:02] Deafyx: its all SS spam
[6:47:13] Wujoh: gingi, deft manuevers makes it so BF is a key builder in aoe
[6:47:16] BruhItsKoda1: Yea you need the no ambush macro @GingiTV
[6:47:19] Wujoh: helps with energy usage
[6:47:20] Deafyx: Theres a macro in the rogue discord to not use ambush
[6:47:29] Laturi1212: deft maneuvers makes it way better in aoe
[6:47:32] lynariah: Dont use Ambush at all :D
[6:47:32] mespe: you dont need macro to not use ambush
[6:47:36] mespe: u just remove it xd
[6:47:37] homixidew: @Deafyx can u send?
[6:47:40] Wujoh: he needs to track BF cd

[6:51:40] Laturi1212: u can press way more bladefury
[6:51:43] GuilherMELHOR: outlul better than sub?
[6:51:52] maddershunt: @GingiTV too much sun and fun fried your gamer brain time to knukkle down for mdi
[6:52:01] tankeern: set dynamic overall YEP
[6:52:31] burbe: it is
[6:52:37] BruhItsKoda1: takes some practice

[6:52:49] BruhItsKoda1: blade flurry very important for this build
[6:53:01] Official_sMiLe: outlaw is probably one of the hardest specs now to actually master fully
[6:53:05] Official_sMiLe: and play to perfection
[6:53:07] burbe: play it 50 h then is feels ok ^^
[6:53:09] AmhoeTV: shouldn't you put bf on your afenar to track it's cd and not just whether it's active?
[6:53:10] teramil: rogue very hard after the rework tbh, i think its great.

[6:53:53] Icehuckticksx: It's the first specc where I actually felt like "this shit is hard"
[6:53:58] firemklol: enhc shammy is the same
[6:54:12] ares__1337: i play assa and it feels way better than outlaw
[6:54:13] Echo_Esports: Gear up for raid with a world-class sitting experience. Enjoy the same long-lasting comfort as Echo, only with the Secretlab TITAN Evo gaming chair: echogg.ly/secretlab/Gingi
[6:54:16] Deafyx: KiR is just a very punishing build to play. If you wipe with AR on CD, its GG.
[6:54:17] Qubuuuu: wouldnt sub be better in m+ since outlaw got capped aoe?
[6:54:18] Official_sMiLe: @Official_sMiLe probably same as if i go to jpc and ask him about sub?
[6:54:23] snkr_frk: outlaw is so rewarding to play and learn
[6:54:39] burbe: super fun
[6:54:46] Dreamz66: Kir is actually hard yeah. I started playing with HO Aoe, its a little bit more forgiving, made it easier to get into it i feel like.
[6:54:49] rosspirogue: How much better is the kir build?
[6:54:56] Wujoh: if sub was better more ppl would be playing it in r1 keys
[6:55:07] frozensov: ghostly strike is also off global i like to macro it into sinister strike and evisc because i keep forgetting to use
[6:55:12] Deafyx: Its a lot better than HO @rosspirogue just super punishing to play if you dont understand rotation and/or wipe alot.
[6:55:13] frozensov: u can ignore the cp gain it doesnt matter
[6:55:15] burbe: but kir is 4 % better i think.
[6:55:17] lynariah: @rosspirogue on the top 50 outlaws - 30 play kir and 20 play HO so both are fine
[6:55:25] skuff1994: skuff1994 subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 2 months! wooop
[6:55:36] Deafyx: Macro GS into ER and forget about it.
[6:55:39] hennfps: kir sims more but hard to play it to its 100% potential
[6:56:04] Volun_: yea kir is really stressful, if you die everything is scuffed
[6:56:18] Onyo1337: @Volun_ rogues can't die tho
[6:56:25] Volun_: that's true tho

[6:56:55] hennfps: sacrificing gcd's to press defensives is also no good if you cant rotate ur cds

[6:57:23] frozensov: try macroing ghostly strike into stuff, you should be sending it on cd, its off global cooldown
[6:57:42] silverain_97: double feint
[6:57:45] BruhItsKoda1: YEP
[6:57:56] BruhItsKoda1: dont need double feint
[6:58:06] radicaL3i: numbing poison instead of atrophic usually or
[6:58:07] frozensov: its amazing
[6:58:11] burbe: its so big imo
[6:58:12] jacarswe: please send talents
[6:58:13] Deafyx: Not taking double feint is trolling
[6:58:14] deeehzz: brh probably. shadowbolts
[6:58:15] BruhItsKoda1: feint is on restless blades and its only 15 sec cooldown
[6:58:15] krimzboss: BIG OUTLAW PLAYER???
[6:58:18] KembriaTV: Yazma if bad rng
[6:58:20] mespe: you dont need double feint
[6:58:20] ImRelentless1: you need igira dagger for the dummies cheat death passive
[6:58:23] Godlenballs: the cd reduces it eonugh to were you can have itup 100% if you want. so need to 2 charge itenough
[6:58:25] mespe: outlaw cdr reduces its cd
[6:58:28] frozensov: you can spam feint with elusiveness, lots of places u need to feint more like brh last boss
[6:58:33] silverain_97: double feint in big pulls
[6:58:33] krimzboss: ouf its funny :D
[6:58:39] silverain_97: i mean its just safe to safe imo
[6:58:43] BruhItsKoda1: 100% do not need double feint
[6:58:44] KembriaTV: Imagine saying you don't need double feint
[6:59:00] BruhItsKoda1: the effective cooldown of feitn is like 3 sec
[6:59:11] BruhItsKoda1: you dont have enough energy to press it on cd
[6:59:14] taibox: hello gingi, how was your vacation?
[6:59:15] babajagga78: hello  all.. extrem162Laser extrem162Laser extrem162Laser extrem162Laser extrem162Laser
[6:59:26] teramil: you will faint without double feint
[6:59:43] ImRelentless1: @GingiTV if you macro Ghostly Strike and you activate it on a mob that dies in 4 seconds isn't it a waste ? I think on BTE is best for macro
