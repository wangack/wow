[0:03:56] Fearless_RaGe: You can’t on mobile 😅
[0:05:00] ghostofnappa_doom: So if Patch 8.1 is coming out After july expectedly. and they want that content to last about 3 months before they drop tbc to extend sub times. Are we expecting TBC to come out near end of the year?
[0:05:28] ghostofnappa_doom: or do we think they are actually gonna overlap release of TBC with release of new wow patch
[0:06:32] Motivess: TBC will be the end of this year, prepratch is gonna be around the same time as that patch hopefully sooner
[0:08:28] geokouts: Good Afternoon, Good Evening and Good Mornig Everyone :)
[0:09:10] ghostofnappa_doom: Yeah that's what I was thinking about. Assuming they drop 9.1 patch in July, mid july or end of july, ride the highs of that for about 3 months, and once that content starts getting stale that's when they drop TBC release.

[1:05:42] ghostofnappa_doom: With the pandemic still causing most of blizzard to be working from home do you think patch 9.1 is going to be very light and lack content and become stale quickly similar to where we are right now
[1:05:52] Sarocus: All pear drinks are awesome
[1:06:03] Sarocus: and pear ice cream
[1:06:17] Inthezonewow: I guess it depends on how big that new maw area is
[1:06:18] Armdel: it kinda depends on how large the new maw zone is
[1:06:52] ghostofnappa_doom: Gotcha. yeah I am hoping there's something to sink our teeth into in terms of replayability because aside from raiding there isn't a whole lot of reason to log into toons
[1:06:52] Zettabyte: he knows Kappa
[1:06:57] kessolover: i would rather wait for something good then play a rushed version

[1:07:13] some_socks: i have been absent from wow for quite a while. i heard updates were coming slower and slower, is that what conversation i just walked into?
[1:07:22] Inthezonewow: If any mount can be used there, I guess it could be as big as they want
[1:07:32] Armdel: i feel like once you get your mount, the maw doesn't feel particularly big anymore
[1:07:48] kessolover: anduin boss maybe?
[1:07:51] Clicklesly: Well, they said the mounts will be used in the Maw, but will that also apply to the new zone?
[1:07:53] MarquisLek: maw is still a boring piece of shit

[1:09:56] KnoNock: gz
[1:10:08] Cilir: Torghast was fun at first now it's just tedious
[1:10:13] ghostofnappa_doom: Venari rep being account wide, and torghast layers should have been account wide, don't know why it took months and months for them to make those changes.
[1:11:23] ghostofnappa_doom: challenging + had some rewards. not nearly enough rewards for the 40+ minutes for every layer through 18 floors
[1:11:35] lithium364: if korthia is the same as the starting maw, people willl mald out
[1:11:41] geokouts: a naked mage do all 18 :P
[1:11:46] Dlax: is there a recommended weapon i should put fiery enchant on as a rogue leveling from 1? (not skinning knife)
[1:11:55] Inthezonewow: Did they confirm new legos?
[1:12:01] submotion: i don't even know what people thought torghast would end up being, the hype was weird to me
[1:12:07] Shongoshi: do you think we will be able to get 2 legendaries equiped in 9.1?
[1:12:09] Quimby54: Or if they're going to scrap soul ash. Don't really care for the poor conversion rate
[1:12:16] Malindan: Torghast and the maw just feel underdeveloped
[1:12:18] CrusaderNero: yeah im not going to play until 9.1 is out.
[1:12:23] ghostofnappa_doom: There is 20 new mounts confirmed in patch 9.1 so that's cool i guess. makes the total obtainable mounts in game over 700
[1:12:23] Moobot: towGreen Shadowlands Limited Edition TOWELLIEE covenant shirts AND Towelliee hats are LIVE! check them out HERE! | Dbh.la/towelliee towBlue
[1:13:15] CrusaderNero: maw is utter shit. with or without mount
[1:13:20] CrusaderNero: saome with torg
[1:13:23] Lornetc: At this point, over promising and underdelivering is the MO for blizz tho.
[1:13:29] Lomaxx3D: @towelliee what add on are you running for your map?
[1:13:41] Shrenko: @Lomaxx3D its just elvui
[1:13:42] submotion: people would even dislike it more if it was endless i think
[1:13:49] ghostofnappa_doom: maw was suppose to be a souls like experience where it's hard and punishing but the problem is in dark souls when you do hard punishing content, you get a massive reward when you complete the hard thing, maw never had any real reward
[1:13:49] Moobot: TBC is around the corner! If you would like to join our community guild in classic while we prepare, we are on Azuresong Horde!

[1:15:02] Folgrum: for example - conduits. they so many and most sux. i didnt even read all conduits. u just pick best for class and forget about it. also cant rotate them cuz of 24h recharge
[1:15:08] ravenoushydra: they want you to suffer
[1:15:18] geokouts: i got a pet from Torghsat
[1:15:26] Inthezonewow: Twisting rewards were so scarce, one every two floors
[1:15:31] Lomaxx3D: @shrenko what add on is he running for his abilities an how does it help over just hot bars?
[1:15:32] GermanBacon: if they would put random transmog rewards in TC, i would be in there 5-6 hours a day
[1:15:34] lithium364: yeah conduits are a waste 80% of them are trash, classes basically only have 2 good ones and the rest are behind in tuning
[1:15:45] Alepouditsa: i didn't bother geting that mount i just change to a druid
[1:15:52] 01FPS: they just had to include token in corridors to famr out and a vendor
[1:15:56] Shrenko: @Lomaxx3D its all elvui like I said
[1:15:59] Folgrum: mount wasnt enough. no way ill go twisted corridors ;)

[1:17:19] MilesC453: What they will do is add in mogs etc to TG, and make the players that have already done it and moved on do it again
[1:17:58] lithium364: yeah but i dont wanna know how much game develeopment went into conduits
[1:18:06] propoopimus: he get kicked out?  why streaming from closet?
[1:18:15] lithium364: just so we use the same 2 conduits for the whole expansion
[1:18:20] Armdel: tfw your bis single target leggo and AoE leggo are the same
[1:19:24] lithium364: and dailys take longer LUL
[1:19:30] ravenoushydra: the thing is people used to say "rpg feeling" and they usually meant librams and arrows not covenants LUL
[1:19:45] atmoszat: i think SL is the least rpg-like expansion since the last 3-4 lol
[1:19:59] flebbooo: yeah 100%
[1:20:33] GermanBacon: less loot means people need to play longer, so they pay for more months. its that simple
[1:20:39] Kaihrn: i mean they tryed same with BFA with the gcd and slowing the game down
[1:20:41] atmoszat: the idea was good, the implementation... not so much
[1:20:49] xKenpachi: what happend to your room ?
[1:20:57] shobolt1980: so u prefer better crassic from shadowlands???
[1:20:57] bruhSit_farmer: they got too excited trying to monetize the classic subscription base and pull them into retail with shadowlands imo
[1:20:58] Rottencoarse: Rottencoarse subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 10 months, currently on a 8 month streak! 
[1:21:30] Sandisy: Nobody wants to play a spreadsheet. You can feel everything is designed around one
[1:21:37] LtDanAndHisMagicLegs: Shadow Lands was a social experiment. Change my mind.
[1:21:50] lithium364: getting feedback for the void/light covenant choice next expansion which will def be balanced Kappa LUL
[1:21:54] dabrebe: idk if it was because i was unemployed at the time but legion launch was awesome
[1:22:14] bruhSit_farmer: shadowlands is a shadow of former expacs
[1:22:32] oslow1337: whats your xp bar addon
[1:23:00] Screamnsteam: Seeing WoW streamers push keys all day is so depressing LUL
[1:23:03] bruhSit_farmer: and not having the team to execute on that idea
[1:23:16] MleveK: I feel it's more rewarding then BFA was. its not perfect but a step ahead for sure
[1:23:20] northern__soul: so true @Towelliee
[1:23:21] bruhSit_farmer: m+ all day everyday has killed the mm,orpg spirit
[1:23:24] ravenoushydra: I think they just can't make good features anymore
[1:23:49] Rottencoarse: tbh bfa was more rewarding :)
[1:23:50] Malindan: I was subbed for all of legion and bfa. Bounced of SL pretty hard at endgame. Not sure why.
[1:23:51] oslow1337: pvp yes !
[1:23:52] Lornetc: oh hell naw it isn't more rewarding
[1:23:54] ShadoodHD: iT's LiKe WoD aLl OvEr AgAiN NotLikeThis
[1:24:01] Sonatta: i miss BFA style world quests PepeHands
[1:24:03] gravess_66: i'll say it if no one wont...I miss corruption. BOOM!
[1:24:03] Inthezonewow: The last 3 months I've spent more time in old content in retail, farming Xmogs, mounts etc
[1:24:04] TheBeastofCaerBannog: feels Like Draenor to me...bored out of my gourd
[1:24:13] zenFX_: Sitting in the garrison throughout WoD was more rewarding
[1:24:15] Stronghammer38: I'm newer to WoW, like didn't start playing until like a chunk into BFA, and I enjoyed BFA more than Shadowlands
[1:24:18] bruhSit_farmer: yea ive spent more time in old content lmao
[1:24:20] lithium364: yeah it def feels like draenor to me as a casual
[1:24:28] Shongoshi: I miss legion :D
[1:24:31] Lornetc: "A sense of pride and accomplishment"
[1:24:32] oslow1337: only good thing about this xpac is pvp and the raid is not so bad
[1:24:38] Anthropophob: shadowlands is worse than draenor. the (planned) story is too big for such slow released content. it doesnt feel as immersive as all the other expacs.
[1:24:54] Cilir: yeah this expan loot rewarding is horrid
[1:25:01] bruhSit_farmer: doesnt even feel like warcraft tbh
[1:25:06] Alienfromger: make loot meaningful LUL
[1:25:16] muhbuhtuh: towCry
[1:25:25] grumpyunclecritter: i got bored with SL faster than any other expac and back to a world of tanks grind
[1:25:27] Shrenko: I havent played in 2months
[1:25:37] HostileLogOut: @Towelliee your just to used to getting loot handouts lol
[1:25:42] rilsolo: if this was the first patch of bfa would people still be playing? with the awful version of azerite gear, no island vendors to buy the mounts where it was completely rng and that raid i forgot the name of?

[1:25:58] bruhSit_farmer: bottom line the expansion feels very rushed and incomplete
[1:26:05] zenFX_: @rilsolo Forgetting is probably for the best
[1:26:11] MleveK: So you would prefer grinding for randomg Titanforge than the valor system? YOu also prefer 1 item in the vault a week rather than a choice of possible 9?
[1:26:31] ghostofnappa_doom: yeah you  knowthere's an issue with your content when the only reason people log in is to check vault and than raid time
[1:26:41] rilsolo: @zenfx_  people keep comparing the whole xpac of bfa to this one patch is why im asking
[1:26:43] lanara233: I miss Flynn. A job's a job mate. Let's get paid. Are you thirsty? I'm thirsty.
[1:26:54] ravenoushydra: it felt like a bandaid
[1:27:19] gravess_66: them not allowing it on previously aquired gear was its downfall
[1:27:19] Moobot: Check out Towelliee's latest Youtube video! https://youtu.be/U8-64zqVa8k Shadowlands needs some help
[1:27:31] bruhSit_farmer: yea hasnt been worth the sub fee latley
[1:27:41] ghostofnappa_doom: after you've already done 100+ keys and than they release the valor system, no shot i'm refarming those items to be able to upgrade with that system
[1:27:46] MleveK: I'm not saying it's perfect at all, every  system needs work, just saying compared to BFA, I feel its a step ahead. again, my opinion.
[1:27:55] Caanan20: oh did you move? or are you just remodeling your house?
[1:28:07] DigitalChill: !room
[1:28:07] Moobot: Towelliee is NOT moving or homeless. He is renovating his streaming room over the next month or so. The background will change, the stream will be scuffed, but it will be worth it! Soon™
[1:28:10] Inthezonewow: @Caanan20 Remodelling the stream room
[1:28:17] Malindan: I'm enjoying other games a lot more now that I don't keep up with wow. Sort of have a double feeling on it since I love wow.
[1:28:18] Lonemike: Lonemike subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 65 months, currently on a 65 month streak! 
[1:28:27] amunkvold1: so you are complaining you dont get enough loot...but you cant upgrade a single piece?
[1:28:32] sagethemage40: i just got sick and tired of putting hours and hours of game time into retail to receive nothing
[1:28:33] Caanan20: word thats cool af whats the theme of the room gonna be?
[1:28:38] MleveK: Well the issue is not that it's not rewarding, it's that its been 6 months without new content. it's a lack of content.
[1:28:39] bruhSit_farmer: yea i been playing alt of other games this expansion
[1:28:40] bruhSit_farmer: lol
[1:29:29] Folgrum: mayby blizz want retail more like classic
[1:29:29] Moobot: towGreen Shadowlands Limited Edition TOWELLIEE covenant shirts AND Towelliee hats are LIVE! check them out HERE! | Dbh.la/towelliee towBlue
[1:29:33] ichitos: I feel like it’s the popular thing to hate on WoW , been playing since 08 and still got a lot of love for the game and never get bored
[1:29:36] Armdel: it just feels like ass getting loot like every 5th keystone you run
[1:29:37] Cilir: it's all bobby's fault lol
[1:29:45] ghostofnappa_doom: I think the pvp vendor made gear  way too accessable and you hit your item threshhold much faster, and if you don't pvp you're doing keys which are just  not nearly compareable, even with the valor changes now

[1:30:05] Adaaraa: in BFA
[1:30:24] bruhSit_farmer: preach doesnt just watch his most recent vid lol
[1:30:29] XarkoLP: Had u hating on WoW in WoD?
[1:30:31] rilsolo: when prot paladins suck?
[1:30:48] ghostofnappa_doom: patch 8.2 .... oh lord farming pearls to get Raid Bis items. get me out
[1:30:49] Jenoseph: shadowlands is just new mounts an pets an mogs everything else is boring now
[1:30:50] riftplaya4ever: big toweliee whats up brotha?
[1:30:56] Giftmaker: Hi. Do streamers feel responsible for that hype at the start of expansion, when game does not meet expectations in result?
[1:30:56] Moobot: Towelliee is NOT moving or homeless. He is renovating his streaming room over the next month or so. The background will change, the stream will be scuffed, but it will be worth it! Soon™
[1:30:59] Ghuardian: The first month and a half of BFA was amazing and 8.2 Was great in my opinion
[1:31:00] ichitos: Not you towelleie but in general :D
[1:31:06] Marmoh: As a casual player, most BFA complaints didn't really apply to me and I ended up loving it
[1:31:10] carpentz0r: @Towelliee how many mounts do you have?
[1:31:12] Caanan20: yeah because the raids in WoD were FIRE
[1:31:13] lithium364: i dont know what the future of wow holds for us, but what i do know is that shadow priests will get more reworks
[1:31:15] lithium364: LUL
[1:31:22] bruhSit_farmer: bfa had grinds that felt rewarding tbh compared to sl
[1:31:25] Caanan20: had more fun raiding in WoD than I had in a long time
[1:31:30] Justarandomman: Well by the numbers that came back for SL show their is still a huge love for an MMO (the genre isn't dead) - but blizz need to put that RPG back into it and not these silly systems
[1:31:35] elitepower97: I would sooner play wod than shadowlands right now
[1:31:35] Arch7: WoD had good raiding, thats about it
[1:31:42] superxfire: My classes felt better to play in BFA
[1:31:43] rilsolo: what grinds exactly? @hjo1992
[1:31:45] ghostofnappa_doom: well Wod had amazing raiding, the problem was they didn't have enough content, it just hit droughts
[1:31:49] Contendedlemon: they needa bring back some cosmetics for doing dungeons like in MoP and WoD those weapons and armors were so dope
[1:31:51] SlayerLightStorm: Having a D3 kick right now. Got to Act II in the campaign last night, playing as a Barbarian.
[1:31:52] Kaihrn: Warlords of collect all the things
[1:31:55] Shongoshi: Dreaner is great if it was your 1st expansion imo
[1:32:04] XarkoLP: the best on WoD was, that u are alone in your garrison.
[1:32:23] Caanan20: I looked forward to loging on to raid in Draenor but now its like a chore to do the raid and I dont like the current raid rn
[1:32:28] riftplaya4ever: patrols I believe
[1:32:35] Malindan: Wod was okish. They learned a lot of lessons on what not to do and we got legion.
[1:32:49] gravlaxxx: are you playing outriders any more?
[1:32:49] capnkalland: I'm tired of grinding in SL for absolutely nothing. it's turned into a gigantic waste of time.
[1:33:23] XarkoLP: a turtle made it to the water Kappa
[1:33:32] Caanan20: I feel like Im so far behind in SL because I had to stop right after the raid was released, work opened back up
[1:33:38] mmrghost7: i doubt it
[1:33:46] ghostofnappa_doom: 60 days of enjoyment and than falls off hard because nothing left to do
[1:33:51] Sandisy: systems hurt the game. returning only to find you're X weeks behind before you're "ready" to raid etc.. yeah, rather unsub again
[1:33:53] lithium364: what if they overbuff the 9.1 raid to extent content LUL
[1:33:56] riftplaya4ever: ya that sounds about right
[1:33:57] Valestrus: have you cleared mythic castle yet?
[1:33:57] ghostofnappa_doom: and have to wait 6+ months for new patch
[1:34:05] propoopimus: !ROOM
[1:34:06] Moobot: Towelliee is NOT moving or homeless. He is renovating his streaming room over the next month or so. The background will change, the stream will be scuffed, but it will be worth it! Soon™
[1:34:09] bruhSit_farmer: the tin monster looks pretty unique lol
[1:34:10] SlayerLightStorm: @Valestrus He has.
[1:34:19] atmoszat: @Caanan20 but you did soemthing useful, instead of farming for nothing, you aint behind ^^
[1:34:22] Jenoseph: the mega dugeon is the best thing i see coming in 9.1 besides flying
[1:34:35] Caanan20: haha for sure
[1:34:35] riftplaya4ever: whats blizz saying about when 9.1 is coming out?
[1:34:36] ghostofnappa_doom: infinite pirate dragon, like what does that even mean
[1:34:43] Shongoshi: didn't they say something like we will kill the eye of the jailer ?
[1:34:44] carpentz0r: any subs know how many mounts he has in retail?
[1:35:08] carpentz0r: hell yeah
[1:35:08] Malindan: What if the raid had layers and floors too 😂
[1:35:08] riftplaya4ever: lol
[1:35:09] Thunderbrew: He's a turtle in the desert. He's hot
[1:35:09] SlayerLightStorm: @Towelliee towLul
[1:35:14] Caanan20: I wish Castle Nathria was better its not a good raid imo I know its fine in terms of like a "good" raid but I just dont like it Idky
[1:35:27] riftplaya4ever: how many in classic?
[1:35:27] Cilir: I'm curious if 9.1 is going to make stygia more relevant
[1:35:37] Mallaes: Tooga <3
[1:35:51] Dreepi: wait, towel in a new place :D ?
[1:35:54] bruhSit_farmer: wonder how 9.1 ends up looking on ptr
[1:35:55] Dreepi: hi btw
[1:36:04] SwifSkully: we kill that big guy in torghast in the new raid
[1:36:07] carpentz0r: im just farming mounts lo
[1:36:13] Epicredclown: It's sad cuz we should cancel sub SL because there is no content but we can't cuz TBC is coming and we want to prepare for it XD
[1:36:13] Thunderbrew: I haven't played retail in a month or more. I hope 9.1 can bring me back.
[1:36:41] Folgrum: i hope for better class balance in 9.1. now its complete crap
[1:36:46] lanara233: Good point
[1:36:47] zenFX_: Right guys, Shadowlands ends when? 9.2 or 9.3? Place your bets people
[1:36:55] Sollice: 9.2
[1:36:57] sagethemage40: most of us havent played the game like that tho and still feel that way about torghast haha
[1:36:59] RealFragkos: 9.2
[1:37:03] Shongoshi: it would be really cool if you could use the ring from castle which counters the eye of jailer in that fight (like when you have ony cloak in nefarion fight in classic)
[1:37:05] bricko89: @Towelliee Gotta remember, if they made a torghast raid that didn't look like torghast... people would also be up in arms about it. I can see both sides.
[1:37:05] bruhSit_farmer: 9.2
[1:37:10] Caanan20: Im just sad that Sylvanas is going to die. She kinda has to but I hate it, shes been my favorite character since I first started playing the game
[1:37:12] Malindan: With the rate it's going 9.2
[1:37:15] bruhSit_farmer: wod 2.5
[1:37:16] Thunderbrew: When is 10?
[1:37:21] fistofnature: 9.2.5
[1:37:21] Moobot: Check out Towelliee's latest Youtube video! https://youtu.be/U8-64zqVa8k Shadowlands needs some help
[1:37:23] Jenoseph: 9.1.5 is my bet
[1:37:26] riftplaya4ever: I think it will be the same as when you run it 100 times over
[1:37:32] Sollice: No they will have a 9.2 for sure
[1:37:45] Malindan: They need the new xpac hype after this.
[1:37:55] carpentz0r: do you have the deathcharger?
[1:37:56] bruhSit_farmer: new expac announcement this year
[1:38:03] Sollice: I say 9.2 and the jailer DOES NOT DIE and the next expansion is an all out cosmic war
[1:38:03] bricko89: 9.3 Lich King 2.0
[1:38:06] carpentz0r: rivendale

[1:38:09] bricko89: Arthas Rather
[1:38:10] enzancow: I think I'm finally done getting baited by xpac
[1:38:19] Caanan20: lmfao not even out of the first raid tier, "When are they gonna announce next xpac?!"
[1:38:20] Ldysansa: Than is it a situation where sit and wait for the expansion after 9.2
[1:38:28] SlayerLightStorm: Rivendare's Deathcharger? I have that mount as well./
[1:38:31] Epicredclown: New expac won't do shit they can't come up to finish the current state of SL
[1:38:33] lithium364: yeah covid mad expac announcments really weird,
[1:38:39] lithium364: *made
[1:38:57] carpentz0r: from lord aurius rivendare
[1:39:07] lithium364: like do we have to wait till next years blizzcon since they dont go to other gaming events anymore
[1:39:08] Sollice: @Epicredclown Sure they could. The jailer accomplishes his goals and he starts taking out other realms.
[1:39:08] carpentz0r: damn
[1:39:10] zenFX_: @Epicredclown They couldnt finish WoD but look at legion when they abandoned WoD to work on it
[1:39:18] carpentz0r: lucky im trying now lol
[1:39:25] Sonatta: for a lot of people WoW is the first month of an expansion
[1:39:27] Caanan20: I got blanchy is 6 attempts!
[1:39:28] Shongoshi: I wonder if in the next one we will be fighting the light (like naaru and so)
[1:39:32] duster517: @Towelliee why is horde better than alliance?
[1:39:51] Varsader: MMO champ is great for the first week "whens the next xpac" threads.. LUL
[1:40:02] Ldysansa: Wow Shadowlands had so much potential. It's to bad it not that great. The areas are great the art work is great.
[1:40:14] Sonatta: no one is interested in Anduin's boy band
[1:40:16] Sollice: I think Blizzard actually has a lot of material to finish this expansion and go to the next. But if it's going to be a standard we killed the jailed and now some new threat is here it will be boring
[1:40:18] MleveK: Alliance going to be the "Bad" Faction
[1:40:27] Sollice: we killed the jailer*
[1:40:31] Caanan20: who's gonna be the next king after Anduin then? Greymane?
[1:40:46] Caanan20: or just make Jaina the Waifu Queen?
[1:40:50] duster517: @Towelliee even before anduinn there was always idk a steryeotype that horde was better?
[1:40:53] Thunderbrew: I hope they keep doing Classic Expansions.
[1:40:56] Epicredclown: Pretty sure most people are more interested in Old contents Like TBC and Wotlk anyway
[1:41:15] muhbuhtuh: towQueen Clap
[1:41:24] Shongoshi: she will be the new jailer
[1:41:29] bricko89: You'll find me in D2 Remastered hahahaha
[1:41:30] MleveK: Wow 10.0 no more factions?
[1:41:32] restokin: I think Shadowlands is a good expansion - it's just the content pace that has made it look like a failure. Shame
[1:41:35] PopeJonas: I played alliance during classic but Im tempted to use my 58 boost on a horde, alliance died on my server
[1:41:37] EggwithEdges: There must always be The Jailer
[1:41:44] zenFX_: I just want an expansion where Im not the 'champion of azeroth'. I want to be a minor again LUL
[1:41:47] carpentz0r: im just doing old dungeons and raids solo lol
[1:41:48] wavy_by_nature: u really think 9.2 gon be the last SL expansion?
[1:41:55] wavy_by_nature: patch*
[1:42:01] Caanan20: Yeah true, everyone wants to see what the next "big thing" is going to be
[1:42:13] Caanan20: thats why Riot Games is making a League of Legends based MMO
[1:42:43] RealFragkos: lol mmo will kill wow
[1:42:45] Sollice: They need to let the shit hit the fan at the end of this expansion BAD. Let the world be in a complete shit show so the next expansion flow feels natural
[1:42:46] Caanan20: the story is really well writen its like they got some of the bioware writers or something lol
[1:42:47] carpentz0r: no one will every make a better mmo than blizzard
[1:43:03] FalconQR: yes but everyone is that "champion"
[1:43:11] lithium364: i wanna heal more woouunds
[1:43:12] tehswede: I'd rather be the villian
[1:43:13] enzancow: Damn tooga and that long ass escort
[1:43:18] Malindan: I still follow the story yeah
[1:43:18] ghostofnappa_doom: i hate that I helped kill a titan with me and the bros, but I also got cut down by a small crocodile that i ran into
[1:43:26] michaisn: I prefer being a random villager
[1:43:31] its_Steevee: yes calling every player "champion" or "maw walker" is lame
[1:43:31] submotion: well you're not tho @Towelliee because everyone is that guy that walks around even the worst players
[1:43:35] zenFX_: @FalconQR exactly. It's pretty daft when you think about it
[1:43:36] Contendedlemon: we should have lost fighitng n'zoth tbfh
[1:43:42] barberbranford: If youre not playing to win whats the point
[1:43:42] fistofnature: Cool items are elitist @Towelliee
[1:43:48] SlayerLightStorm: @zenFX_ Tough shit man. It's a game.
[1:43:49] lithium364: agree we should have lost against nzoth
[1:43:54] gravess_66: we already lost, nzoth killed us. i still believe it
[1:43:55] Epicredclown: Wut expansion you had the most fun playing towelliee ?
[1:44:02] wavy_by_nature: its disappointing coz SL with the potential of so much content and stories with Lich King, Sylvannas, Tyrande, Bwomsamdi, Tyrande, so many potential arcs in the expansion with the theme
[1:44:02] ShadoodHD: towTinfoil
[1:44:02] Sollice: Watch Belleulllaralllaslrlalrlal video about that
[1:44:03] paulpoppin: I still hope we lost the N'Zoth fight and at the end of SL we wake up from the dream.
[1:44:05] Shrandamar: yeah N'zoth isnt gone for sure, it's all part of his plan
[1:44:06] cruzeal: you never know mushuShrug
[1:44:07] ScytaleTv: Sylvanas Becomes the new Jailor after she rescues Anduin
[1:44:07] Sollice: I cant spell his name
[1:44:08] flebbooo: Shadowlands i just another vision monkaS
[1:44:11] ghostofnappa_doom: nzoth comes back and he's the jailors boss . it was all a ruse.
[1:44:14] zenFX_: @SlayerLightStorm dont chat to me assuming im bitching. who tf are you
[1:44:14] michaisn: maby we already lost to cthun back in the day
[1:44:16] Caanan20: and we've just gone completely insane because we're trapped in our minds by nzoth?
[1:44:24] Cilir: haven't you people been watching bellular's videos lol
[1:44:25] Shrenko: towTinfoil
[1:44:30] duster517: i feel like constantly winning is detrimental to the story, it kinda goes into the superman complex, meaning that hes nearly indestructable with one weakness makes for a boring character
[1:44:32] Armdel: @Sollice i wanna say he has already done that lol
[1:44:35] geokouts: We lost to N'zoth and Sylvanas is gonna save us all!
[1:44:35] Mosoner: Nzoth should have won for sure leading to black empire expac

[1:44:51] paulpoppin: Like, N'Zoth is the old god of trickery, even in HS his hero says when you threaten " Dream with me" . We might be just dreaming.
[1:44:55] flebbooo: Old gods are in imo the coolest things blizz has for lore potenial in the future. Hoping they do some crazy shit with them

[1:45:28] paulpoppin: Belluar and Pyromancer have some cool theories around it
[1:45:28] Epicredclown: Most epic fight was Arthas and Illidan cuz we actually fought the boss for real

[1:47:06] wavy_by_nature: are there any potential classes that they could still add in future expansions? any that u wanna see be added
[1:47:09] gravess_66: xalateth dagger, since it dissapeared in the cinematic
[1:47:10] Sollice: Nzoth always knew about the jailer and he warned us the entire BfA expansion
[1:47:10] Marmoh: Are you saying you’re not gonna provide some quality react content :p
[1:47:26] Caanan20: I was mostly listening to the conversation and reading chat not really watching the S tier gameplay of escorting a turtle across one of the bigger zones in classic lol

[1:47:35] its_Steevee: his whispers
[1:47:37] Sollice: He wanted for us to work with him because he said he was the only one that could actually save us all and azeroth
[1:47:39] Shrandamar: he's been warning us since Legion actually
[1:47:43] Shrenko: you should actually watch that video @Towelliee
[1:47:48] Sollice: All of those whispers from him and iyllginoth
[1:48:01] Malindan: Asmontowelliee LUL
[1:48:07] its_Steevee: cliff notes dont do it justice towelie you just just watch the video for yourself at some point
[1:48:12] Lornetc: well if shes corrupted by the old gods.
[1:48:16] Sollice: Magni may actually be a fuck boi Jailer agent
[1:48:32] on_sale_menswear: It's in the actual auctionator settings
[1:48:37] BobbyBones: 24 hrs is max
[1:48:47] its_Steevee: where the hell is Magni? spooning with mother?
[1:48:49] bricko89: Wrathion been warning us for so long he'll lose his cool because we don't listen and he'll be Deathwing 2.0.
[1:49:03] ghostofnappa_doom: well i found out a trick that gets you over to nalak much faster when you're farming world bosses
[1:49:04] Caanan20: nah hes sleeping with THE mother of all mothers
[1:49:22] bricko89: Magni is busy healing her woooons
[1:49:29] SlayerLightStorm: Well zen, that's what you get for getting defensive.
[1:49:38] Caanan20: yeah gotta cool them burnin loins
[1:50:12] SlayerLightStorm: Nah.
[1:50:32] Kaihrn: OMG that MIGHT happen knowing blizz these days jaja
[1:50:34] SlayerLightStorm: Wrathion becoming Deathwing 2.0? I don't see that happening.
[1:50:49] bricko89: I was being extremely facetious
[1:50:54] bricko89: @SlayerLightStorm
[1:50:59] Caanan20: isnt Wrathion dead?
[1:51:01] Kaihrn: we need Nomi back
[1:51:07] TweakT: sstvNPC sstvSIP sstvCharlos
[1:51:10] Caanan20: or did I not understand that Raid boss fight?
[1:51:23] Telke: he's not dead
[1:51:24] Marmoh: Magni would make a great center piece on my table
[1:51:36] Malindan: Plotmachine
[1:52:01] its_Steevee: wrathion is like q from star trek
[1:52:05] Caanan20: you could argue that Wrathion is on Azeroths side not the horde or alliance side
[1:52:06] TweakT: plough thru the pussies and burn thru the witches
[1:52:14] Caanan20: trying to keep the planet alive and well

[1:52:28] bricko89: @Towelliee You were right earlier though. The potential plot / lore of this expansion so far / upcoming is definitely better than the content thus fare.
[1:52:30] bricko89: far*
[1:52:34] Broomba: @towelliee thanks for posting that behind the scenes of DMX and the ruff riders documentary film
[1:52:55] TweakT: Dig through the ditches and burn through the witches
[1:53:04] ShadoodHD: FF14 kinda spoiled me ngl LUL
[1:53:21] MleveK: Oh yeah, continuation is so much better.
[1:53:25] Shrenko: yeah FF14 story is just superior
[1:53:36] bricko89: I'm ok with the continuation to a point. I feel like Gul'Dan & Garrosh stories went on too long for their respective xpacs
[1:53:37] CasualSCN: Kappa
[1:53:39] ghostofnappa_doom: i mean when you think about it arthas and illidan were continued stories for a long time  from warcraft 3 stories of the eternal battle with the burning legion and archimonde
[1:53:48] bigbearjackson: You do realize Deathwing isn't really dead so I'm looking for him to pop up when Wrathion starts to go off the deep end
[1:53:59] flebbooo: I still wonder what they'll do with Garrosh in SL
[1:54:05] Kromede: pikaOMG
[1:54:23] Caanan20: back when SL was announced I was hoping that Sylvanas would become the next lich king and open a new faction to join with her as the leader
[1:54:24] Sonatta: PokPikachu
[1:54:25] Kaihrn: MoP really was a fun expantion ill never forget when they put oondasta in and it took like 4 raid groups to kill haha
[1:54:33] ShadoodHD: well that and you kinda have to remember wtf is happening in the first place xD... just takes commitment like wow :p
[1:55:10] lithium364: well we still have the teaser from m.o.t.h.e.r in the heart chamber where one more titan place is under attack which we havent been to yet right

[1:58:56] fistofnature: CouldYouNot dont you want your gem slots?
[1:58:57] barberbranford: no one can escape the Maw
[1:58:59] Caanan20: I feel like I just rolled a 1 in a DnD game, learning that now I get to spend more time in the maw than ever before!
[1:59:44] lanara233: It would be really funny if 9.1 puts everyone in the Maw and makes them do campaign quests to get out
[1:59:44] Malkyr: I feel like they didnt learn from Argus. Super gloomy destroyed wastelands that are full of trash mobs you cant avoid are not fun to play in
[2:00:01] Caanan20: plot twist we never left the maw, we've just been the Jailers bitch

[2:01:06] wreckshoptv: wait is the venari rep account wide?
[2:01:12] ghostofnappa_doom: still can't go to beast warrens if you don't have venari rep high enough . even if main toon is maxed with her
[2:01:16] MleveK: Maw is, if your druid, its ok, if you're not, it sucks

[2:03:37] toocagow: only the socket item and condut item are accoutn wide

[2:04:51] filos0phia: the worst part about the maw for me was how much it punished dying. Playing with War mode became a risk to progression
[2:04:54] Caanan20: yeah I mean on like release time it was really hard doing week 3 of torghast was a nightmare
[2:05:02] ghostofnappa_doom: nope you still get the fear that kills you from the debuff, you also still take the double damage from peridition hold. so although vernari vendor items are account wide, the buffs to enter zones are still dependant on that toons rep with her
[2:05:13] Caanan20: I did it but I was in there for like 6 hours trying to beat the last floor for each section lol
[2:05:47] filos0phia: @dondickrleone shamans have some of the best powers imo
[2:05:48] BobbyBones: nemo
[2:05:58] ghostofnappa_doom: i still clear the maw shadehound hunt on my 12 capped toons each week, and only one has beastwarrens unlocked, all the rest i get mage food from someone and than just corrider creeper to the beastwarrens spawn and each time i get feared i stop and eat mage food to heal up. it's very tedious

[2:11:22] ghostofnappa_doom: if the phasehunter mount is in some way related to a 6 month sub, they shouldn't stack it with a patch 9..1 release. it should be staggered for more sub effeciency
[2:11:50] ghostofnappa_doom: if we are assuming that tbc release will include the phasehunter with a 6 month sub
[2:12:41] Mightbeworth: which server yall playing on for TBC bud? @Towelliee
[2:12:48] ravenoushydra: it has a weird low res texture tho that looks like it might belong in tbc

[2:17:24] ghostofnappa_doom: mage gotta afford his flying for tbc
[2:17:26] NovaSun84: Yup, he is making good bank, I used him from 42-46 :)

[2:18:57] Azphelle: @ghostofnappa_doom it's like the flu vaccine, you can still get the virus, you just won't die from it
[2:18:58] ghostofnappa_doom: probably more of a medical question for a doctor tbh, just curious if you had heard anything while you were there

[2:56:18] Hathyn: ZG is like 32k-22k a run depending on if you are running solo, duo, triples
[2:56:20] Pruric: @Towelliee thank you! i am for it aswell! for the dads and fulltime jobb persons
[2:56:28] Broomba: boosting to 58 bc prepatch makes sense and logically sound @towelliee
[2:56:29] ArcaneSyntax: bring on the barber shop!
[2:56:31] Chobgob: a dungeon with loot*
[2:56:33] SSD511_: @broomba  idk man I try to love this game but I can’t
[2:56:41] Imtheguy15: classic forever people dont understand ppl like the boost because they want to play bc not classic
[2:56:44] Lornetc: Yeah its totally a dungeon, just outdoor
[2:56:47] Kize_Gaming: @Towelliee Did Blizz announce yet if they are going to add faction changing for TBC Classic ?
[2:56:50] Niksen_99: will this warrior be tanking in tbc? :D
[2:56:58] Bombayshow: Pruric you have time for attonements ?
[2:57:03] Bombayshow: LUL
[2:57:07] Artonis1: wetlands?
[2:57:10] Broomba: @doom_82 if you are having fun leveling in ff14, then you can do it, if not then you wont be able to do it
[2:57:12] Masqerader: Loch?
[2:57:13] xXSiebzehnXx: also  epl
[2:57:23] Cowboykris: I think faction changing should be allowed as long as it’s to balance a server
[2:57:41] ghostofnappa_doom: hillsbrad foothills bottom right corner, that castle with all elites was like a dungeon for those quests
[2:57:43] OzCreamz: SWTOR did the outdoor elite areas well
[2:57:44] Lornetc: If you did them they give good gear and good xp.
[2:57:45] Broomba: 20-25 elites in loch modan for quests -- tough AF @towelliee
[2:58:13] SSD511_: @broomba yes I hear that storyline amazing but the game play bad like a mobile games
[2:58:46] xXSiebzehnXx: i miss swtor, wish it had done better. I think they would've if they delivered what they promised at launch]
[2:59:04] ArcaneSyntax: i liked the heroic areas, but they only work when there's people leveling, its why tbc and wotlk removed the elites.
[2:59:05] Broomba: @doom_82 i zone into the story and leveling and ignore the game play -- dont see it as a mobile game
[2:59:05] Moobot: Check out Towelliee's latest Youtube video! https://youtu.be/U8-64zqVa8k Shadowlands needs some help
[2:59:07] Masqerader: Only way I was gonna play tbc was with a boost
[2:59:08] carpentz0r: hahaha slop is slipping
[2:59:15] Bombayshow: wrath of the recycled things LUL
[2:59:15] carpentz0r: slope*
[2:59:15] Masqerader: 1 boost per account, oh the horror
[2:59:22] campingking615: for a guy like me that's only allowed or able to play on Saturdays it's a godsend
[2:59:24] DoubleNova: slippery slope = fun
[2:59:27] MuttonChopins: people in classicwow reddit seem pro boost until the madseason video came out
[2:59:43] Imtheguy15: classic andy to dumb to realize ppl coming back to wow for bc not classic they why they like the boost option
[2:59:45] ghostofnappa_doom: at the end of the day they are putting a lot of development time and work into BC and if people play it when they already have subscriptions that's stuff to do for people that they get for free. blizzard doing a boost just creates a market where they can make some moremoney
[2:59:57] Bombayshow: people will soon ask to buy atonements since they have a family LUL
[2:59:58] ghostofnappa_doom: Bobby may be rich as fuck but that doesn't mean they don't have to still make money for the business
[3:00:11] JaMinky: most of the opposition ive seen is jsut people worrying about bots boosting to 58 and getting going right away
[3:00:12] mandarinetip: lol
[3:00:15] Broomba: use the boost to 58 if your friends are 60 and ready for bc and you are not 60 - logical
[3:00:31] SSD511_: Can’t wait for the first look of dreamhaven

[3:00:53] Kize_Gaming: The same people who pay for XP boosts on their private servers they pay to play on ... yeah I don't listen to those type of folks.
[3:00:56] ghostofnappa_doom: I'd pay blizzard $500 for them to give me a world boss mount. i'll say it
[3:01:07] ArcaneSyntax: @towelliee my favorite criticism of the boost is "but you wont know how to play your class!" mfer classes have 1 button rotations.
[3:01:10] Bombayshow: Activision new UNLOCKED ATONEMENTS BOOST ! 120 bucks !
[3:01:13] Pruric: For me personly, the boosting option is a god sent, i can finaly playTBC(C). with a job from 7-3 and 2 kids at home, i cant spend 10 hours a day levling in classic to reach 58, just so i can play TBC
[3:01:13] Bombayshow: LUL
[3:01:35] 00Nikh: leveling isn't an achievement or a milestone, it's a time sink.
[3:01:35] MistaHat: It is just one per account....wtf is the big deal. the more important thing is, hey we have people playing???? am i missing something?
[3:01:42] Moobot: towBleedpurple towGold Thanks for supporting The Hammer Squad by watching these 3 minutes of commercials! towGold You also have the option to subscribe to further plant yourself in our community and no longer see ads! towUp towBleedpurple
[3:01:56] Broomba: reddit reflects world gripes and issues that become the news
[3:02:42] ArcaneSyntax: levelis also often, extremely frustrating depending on class, almost quit a bunch of times on my shaman.
[3:03:08] Broomba: bc private server endless
[3:03:10] Artonis1: private server
[3:03:12] elitepower97: its a server
[3:03:15] elitepower97: private
[3:03:21] EukaryaJ: been working long hours the last few days, so I apologize if you touched on it before.     What do you think of big push dungeon competition
[3:03:31] ArcaneSyntax: pirate server more like.
[3:03:50] ghostofnappa_doom: I think boost makes sense, because asking a friend to play TBC with you but they have to grind a toon from 1 to 60 in prepartion but they really don't like vanilla and they want you to level with them again but you don't wanna level or w/e it is a decent solution to grinding for some people
[3:03:51] Swampheat: Hey chat, i just missed it, when will the pre patch be?
[3:03:53] Broomba: endless can give u 8 times X P leveling
[3:04:08] Bombayshow: I god summoned in shat , that was my experience LUL

[3:06:12] SSD511_: I started tbc at 24 years old was good old days
[3:06:35] Xarith: not the pre nerf heroics
[3:06:35] ghostofnappa_doom: I would say level 70 is gonna be crazy because there's gonna be 40 bots sitting in the elemental plataeu tagging every mob perma farming the motes day in and day out
[3:07:23] SSD511_: In classic people don’t know shit wow imagine boosted mara like that

[3:10:03] Lornetc: People got badgeloot and the content nerfed itself.
[3:10:07] Leeon: he played classic so probably yea
[3:10:11] apeescapade: I hope, he's great at the most busted tank lol
[3:10:17] ghostofnappa_doom: Yeah if they do care, the plateau will be a really easy place to expose bots so we will see but honestly i won't get too involved with tbc the way i was with classic, mainly because i don't have the friendgroup this time around wanting to play
[3:10:32] apeescapade: fair
[3:10:47] carpentz0r: is prot warrior good for shadowlands?
[3:11:16] Bombayshow: yeah they will probably run scripts in slave pens
[3:11:18] Bombayshow: LUL
[3:11:45] ghostofnappa_doom: yeah i guess  that makes sense, trying to hide to extend bots life duration to make the money they make worthwhile for the sub cost and time it takes to cap ect
[3:11:48] Bombayshow: Cant wait for those kyrian warrior to go back farming renown ! LUL
[3:11:56] Bombayshow: stupid covenants -_-
[3:11:58] carpentz0r: ok thanks thinking about making one i main a bear right now

[3:12:41] jakeslol: GMs dont exist anymore after bobby kottick's bonus
[3:12:58] Lornetc: Theres TONS of bots on Pagle too
[3:13:02] HaxzorJimDuggan: bots will just door hack through any locked door, they do it now in scarlet monastery
[3:13:07] Bombayshow: they just buy another account sadly
[3:14:15] Burkinstein: You got me earlier, but I appreciate the double shoutout lol.
[3:14:17] Zerfell: They just need kernal level security to track botting while the game is running
[3:14:17] Moobot: TBC is around the corner! If you would like to join our community guild in classic while we prepare, we are on Azuresong Horde!

[3:14:19] perow_: hey towel where did all your backround stuff go?
[3:14:20] Bombayshow: They just have to go full twitter
[3:14:21] ghostofnappa_doom: i mean the way valorant did their anti cheating is they installed a giant fucking system connected straight to your bios that is always running. and a lot of people don't like having vanguard just sitting collecting data all the time
[3:14:28] Jeffblute88: Bots are terrible in classic right now I have reported so many bots but the problem is I see them  a few days later. same area, doing the same thing. no changes. :(
[3:14:40] hammack52: @Towelliee while this will be a very unpopular opinion i think they shoudl just drop the WoW token in to classic, this will get rid of a fair chunk of bot that are attached to gold farmers
[3:14:47] normysan: !room
[3:14:47] Moobot: Towelliee is NOT moving or homeless. He is renovating his streaming room over the next month or so. The background will change, the stream will be scuffed, but it will be worth it! Soon™
[3:14:52] HaxzorJimDuggan: if they ban enough bots they could make enough money to pay for more GM's because bots are buying new accounts LUL
[3:14:59] remixonfire91: i still see a lot of multiboxers doing the herb run in bastion
[3:15:09] Masqerader: all i heard was wow token and got curious to check and its up to 149k lol
[3:15:13] Bombayshow: I say bring back oceanic servers and lock them in LUL
[3:15:20] ghostofnappa_doom: yeah i had a lot of issues early on, from my understanding it's better now but i had uninstalled it when my harddrive was dying because i was trying to save it haha
[3:15:21] Sandman_88: @hammack52 cant agree with tthat at all
[3:15:49] Artonis1: just wait until they good boosted bots. 100k x whatever boost price is monthly
[3:15:50] Bombayshow: they take their runescape money to get more wow accounts

[3:16:06] Dlax: what level you being boosted in mara too? @Towelliee
[3:16:07] ghostofnappa_doom: but they have to make sure they wait about 4 months before bannign the bots otherwise they risk the bots not making value on existing and risk losing the subs coming back
[3:16:07] Keyastaron_: 1.5 million Kreygasm
[3:16:09] Masqerader: unless those bots are using gold farmed in retail to buy tokens for gametime
[3:16:10] Lornetc: One Point Five Million Dollars.
[3:16:12] AlaskanStrat: thats the ceo's lunch date
[3:16:28] hammack52: @Sandman_88 i did say it was a very Unpopular opinion
[3:16:38] JoshStrobl: Surely they'd be purchasing it in a location where the currency isn't as a strong, so they have more of a purchasing power and end up spending less?
[3:16:38] Bombayshow: ban the bots, Dont remove the Subribtion. cash in  LUL

[4:04:18] ravenoushydra: the new visuals look super good and are pretty faithful to the original
[4:04:37] Hathyn: yup
[4:04:39] Sieppi: Yes
[4:04:39] Masqerader: yes
[4:04:42] ghostofnappa_doom: You have to beat the game all the way through base mode to get nightmare, and than all the way through nightmare to get hell unlocked
[4:04:42] Wildside1177: Have to beat Normal to unlock Nightmare
[4:04:45] dalaraz: after killing last boss you get a choice
[4:04:45] Masqerader: @Towelliee and when u die you lose exp
[4:04:47] symboliic24: 7 fucking adds man that shit is too much hate all these forced adds now on twitch lol
[4:04:47] Ambersulfr: Yes
[4:04:51] dreamgroove1: What is the experience add on you have? I love it @towelliee
[4:05:02] Ambersulfr: Each new clear unlocks the higher difficulty
[4:05:08] notorietyy: its a weak aura
[4:05:14] dalaraz: @dreamgroove1 its a luxthos weakaura i think
[4:05:15] Wildside1177: In Nightmatre and Hell the rares get immunities andbuffs....LOTS of them.
[4:05:21] dreamgroove1: Thank you!
[4:05:24] holybriannn: after hell you go sleep
[4:05:24] Masqerader: u farm to kill uber bosses
[4:05:25] heavymetalhorns: Boss runs for gear
[4:05:27] Sieppi: farm or make another character
[4:05:28] NovaSun84: you "play the game"
[4:05:36] Ambersulfr: You keep farming for better gear in hell
[4:05:37] dalaraz: you aim to end gear and lvl 99 @Towelliee
[4:05:40] ravenoushydra: these are the original affixes tho lol
[4:05:42] Ambersulfr: Oculus, etc
[4:05:44] ghostofnappa_doom: after hell youve played that toon for 150 plus hours and you probably start on a new toon or just farm better gear
[4:05:48] dalaraz: plus you lose xp per death @Towelliee
[4:05:58] Masqerader: @Towelliee they also have season ladders as well for a race on leaderboards. and when u die u loss exp, so it hurts progress
[4:06:00] Wildside1177: You can run into mobs that are immune to Physical and cold and attack at 5X the mormal rate for example
[4:06:06] zootied: This songs lit
[4:06:15] Masqerader: nightmare
[4:06:21] Ambersulfr: If you find sojs or things you don’t want you can trade them for what you do want
[4:06:25] dalaraz: bit on nightmare,more on hell @Towelliee
[4:06:31] 91Niki: oooooof
[4:06:32] ghostofnappa_doom: i believe once you make the choice to continue the game after killing baal to go on nightmare you than lose xp on deaths
[4:06:36] 91Niki: the reality LUL
[4:06:44] NovaSun84: the progress bar moving looks so nice
[4:07:10] NovaSun84: Once you get to 50, you get to see the ZG 1pull!
[4:07:30] Wildside1177: Oh man I cannot wait to see the new Duriel. That fight will be fun.
[4:07:35] ghostofnappa_doom: i'd say before you ship it and stick it wait for act 3 come out, man act 3 was just so good
[4:07:40] Ambersulfr: If you think of it as WoW w/o raids and experience loss that pretty much covers it. You exp grind and gear grind.
[4:07:56] MaavR6: thats how quin was playing it
[4:07:58] Getitonthelow: done with outriders?
[4:08:13] 91Niki: wow what a jebait. I opened bnet, and i got a pop up saying D2 Tech alpha is live, but i don't have access LUL

[4:08:13] dalaraz: you nave to /players # ingame to set it
[4:08:19] hellsinge: yes /players 8
[4:08:22] hellsinge: in game
[4:08:36] ghostofnappa_doom: but in terms of what those POE dudes do with their game it will be hard for an older game that is remastered to have an chance in todays game industry
[4:08:37] Wildside1177: You type /players 4 for example
[4:08:38] hellsinge: u can do /players 2
[4:08:39] Masqerader: also building ur character in the game at higher end takes a lot @Towelliee you need to balance str,dex etc to wear certain pieces of gear etc
[4:08:39] theDirtyon3: Feng Pog
[4:08:39] skilzgre: is boosting they way to lvl atm?
[4:08:43] hellsinge: thats like its 2 players in game
[4:08:44] Ambersulfr: It’s worth it, more players mean more loot
[4:08:45] dalaraz: yes
[4:08:46] CADZtv: that should be called masochist difficulty lool
[4:08:52] hellsinge: better mf and more xp
[4:08:54] drunch85: every odd number of players increases loot
[4:08:57] BennyHaste: oh no
[4:09:00] MaavR6: i think it drops way more items
[4:09:00] NovaSun84: more mob density, so I guess "more drops"
[4:09:02] Wildside1177: using /players 2 is usually ok
[4:09:03] dalaraz: x8 on everything,even loot
[4:09:04] ravenoushydra: rip
[4:09:06] Alaquane: I used to /players 4 to xp in the 80s
[4:09:07] not_bob_ross_: rip
[4:09:19] theDirtyon3: 10 dollars Feng and Max end up talking about MMO's
[4:09:27] not_bob_ross_: at least he got his ding off-towelliee2021
[4:09:29] hellsinge: if u have some good gear /players 8 is no problem
[4:09:35] hellsinge: way more xp
[4:09:39] hellsinge: nah
[4:09:42] ghostofnappa_doom: /3 wouldn't be too hard tbh but the loot would be much better

[4:09:49] dalaraz: you prolly not notice it
[4:09:55] Ambersulfr: Depends on your gear
[4:10:03] hellsinge: imagen that 1 player use to carry 7 players in normal d2 so its ok
[4:10:04] Ambersulfr: If you have rune words you’ll probably be fine
[4:10:09] Masqerader: but on hell if u are built for physical and the mobs are immune to physical then you're gonna be fucked
[4:10:28] NovaSun84: In your current state, I don't think maximizing difficulty is required
[4:10:36] EggwithEdges: @Ambevsulfr you think towelliee knows about runewords without playing D2 before? heh
[4:10:44] drunch85: there was no level cap right?
[4:10:44] ghostofnappa_doom: you are probably not going to see whirlwind
[4:10:50] dalaraz: you prolly cant reach it in alpha,or thats what krip said at least @Towelliee
[4:11:05] Zaylez: datmodz reached level 30 with his amazon
[4:11:15] Wildside1177: Whirlwind Barb with dual light sabres. Oh yeah Towelliee.
[4:11:23] Ambersulfr: @eggy_z well then let’s tell him towHAMUP
[4:11:41] EggwithEdges: There's not many runewords to farm on normal anyway
