[0:45:03] efpsychi: Because Trill plays on Bene
[0:45:12] ScenarioLabs: But this is a tourney with a TR.
[0:45:38] efpsychi: Yeah but the TR isn't enough to get practice
[0:45:43] gamernick410: ^
[0:46:01] ScenarioLabs: Yeah, Dew probably just wants to DPS for once. Makes sense.
[0:46:35] nikthevoker: @snutzy has chan tried TR yet?

[0:58:49] alireza00700: thunder gonna be stronger or lsp?
[0:58:49] Recyclemanx: no like isn't the 1% already on there so you need the same 6% showing, just easier to get?
[0:59:06] odjadjaqt: yo this is dope, classic should keep a realm like this perm. for ppl that only like arenas imo
[0:59:07] Azohx: are there no enchanted tears on TR?

[1:13:56] Ehkys: private?
[1:14:12] JonaDefty: why is the simian sphere on here lmao
[1:14:14] ScenarioLabs: Take out the Ulduar10 gear and put in Naxx10.
[1:14:17] ScenarioLabs: Big oof.
[1:14:19] Free3ze: PvP tournament

[1:14:27] Splix1: Pika gonna get grim toll and surprise everyone with combat monkaS
[1:14:31] Free3ze: On weekends
[1:14:47] Ehkys: is the AT relm public to make toons on?
[1:14:49] JonaDefty: what helm is that?
[1:14:52] odjadjaqt: yes
[1:14:54] jubofdahut: YH

[1:15:30] killrog__: yeah minor speed mandatory
[1:15:32] dawsonator171: I hope hozi gets his shit figured out.
[1:15:41] Deifnoon: wtf is this?
[1:15:43] odjadjaqt: @dawsonator171 wat happened
[1:16:31] jubofdahut: isnt it 45?
[1:16:43] Eremoo: 45s
[1:16:49] Eremoo: according to wowhead
[1:17:25] Ehkys: how do you find the tournament relm server?
[1:17:48] Ehkys: ahh ok
[1:17:54] fateless22: same team this tourney snutzy?
[1:18:04] dawsonator171: this blue body type 2 is making me puke
[1:18:06] Ehkys: they should just keep it up year round, I would pay to just play on AT servers
[1:18:12] efpsychi: He's playing with Kubzy and Chanstro this time @fateless22
[1:18:32] DashD: is that arena realm?
[1:18:41] Free3ze: Maybe jeathSmirk
[1:18:52] kukionz: to be fair, I think people enjoy the subtle progression of their chars more than they believe
[1:18:54] JonaDefty: do you think you'd play any matchups as horde on TR or ally all the way as LSP?
[1:19:03] odjadjaqt: why would it kill it? ppl that play pve would still play reg servers, this is just a niche server for ppl purely into arena
[1:19:24] Eremoo: then play arena on live
[1:19:28] odjadjaqt: i guess
[1:19:46] odjadjaqt: @Eremoo well genius, this server removes the need to grind for pve etc. but anyways who cares lol
[1:19:52] kukionz: They should have made hateful not cost valor though
[1:19:58] Eremoo: so you're removing an integral part of an mmo? Got it
[1:19:58] kukionz: Make it easy at heroic gear to get
[1:20:14] cokexdxd: can u not get belt buckle on tr?
[1:20:24] williwhite94: pvp gear is very easy to get lol
[1:20:26] hennessylolx: Itâ€™s easy to gear on classic
[1:20:27] kukionz: Can you not level blacksmithing on the tr? =P
[1:20:39] odjadjaqt: @Eremoo lol its not getting removed tho? it would just be a seperate place for ppl that purely just wanna arena can play, why is that hard to understand
[1:20:45] JonaDefty: do you think the ulduar gear on here is intentional even?
[1:20:58] Eremoo: @odjadjaqt go bk to whatever private server u played in then, no1 cares
[1:20:59] Free3ze: @eremoo some ppl ( a minority , nonetheless) enjoy it to just start playing arena not worrying about gear scripeThinking
[1:21:00] Hotyounglad: 219ilvl
[1:21:08] MattyxoTV: Everyone going to be scrambling to fix those bis lists for 219 items
[1:21:11] MattyxoTV: :D
[1:21:13] kukionz: @williwhite94  yeah, but I feel like it takes a lot longer than getting pre bis raid gear (a weekend)
[1:21:14] Hotyounglad: think they just put stuff in that was 213 - 226 ilvl
[1:21:26] williwhite94: @kukionz true i feel u there
[1:21:27] praisedtwitch: @snutzy what spell pen u want as ele? Saw a bis list from daylie that showed only 35
[1:22:38] cokexdxd: @snutzy why not signet of the malevolent over deadly ring? the better sp better than more hit and haste?
[1:22:47] cokexdxd: oh shit
[1:22:50] cokexdxd: my bad i just tuned in
