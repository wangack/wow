[1:45:20] StreamElements: jonathankanalt just subscribed for 2 months in a row PogChamp
[1:45:23] kitkatz07: it's a representation of what investors value the company at, so if razor is a multi billion company then either the investors are wrong or their shares are very dilluted
[1:45:29] zann_tv: i just "shorted"
[1:45:29] ivomagnum: the more I learn about the stock market the more I'm convinced that nobody really knows what's going on but everybody likes "number go up" :D

[2:13:28] Samixx22: csgo is cancer game eventho i play it
[2:13:29] rbubbaray: new world feels odd but the fighting is nice
[2:13:31] danzos: well you can go full speed backwards with your mouse + strafe so that solves it basically
[2:13:38] danzos: a little learning curve
[2:13:45] Samixx22: new world grind is cancer
[2:13:51] danionlive: They nerfed Everytthing
[2:13:52] bepsisthebeast: i think wow has the best movement
[2:13:53] danionlive: Its awful
[2:13:53] bepsisthebeast: for sure
[2:13:57] Samixx22: you need to do the same content over and over for max gear
[2:13:57] danionlive: They have NO idea what the hell they are doing
[2:14:13] MadManMacFarlane: new world was a joke of a game
[2:14:15] bepsisthebeast: what did you expect from amazon
[2:14:16] rbubbaray: new world the grind for watermarks got stupid grindy
[2:14:17] Samixx22: @danionlive +1 amazon 0
[2:14:21] bepsisthebeast: they think they can par up with wow?
[2:14:35] DovahChicken: i had way more fun in the new world beta than in the acculy game Sadge
[2:14:49] Katrikan: 10% speed isnt that bad. there are still ways to catch up and lockdown ppl with GA/SnS. The charge is still there, the leap is still there
[2:14:52] bepsisthebeast: i tried playing new world but my buddy doesnt have it yet
[2:14:59] bepsisthebeast: i cant wait till he gets it
[2:15:01] rbubbaray: cause it was new in beta
[2:15:05] Katrikan: and sword got no nerfs whatsoever
[2:15:15] rbubbaray: it doesnt have enough for 60s to do
[2:15:36] anticensor_: its still like 20% of classic grind LUL
[2:15:48] rbubbaray: most players want raids
[2:15:50] thamysticog: yeah they killed my Ice gauntlet
[2:15:50] StreamElements: Viewers and Subscribers generate points! You can redeem them at store for on screen effects! https://streamelements.com/swifty/store
[2:15:51] thamysticog: hate it
[2:15:56] diabl712: I liked the pvp melee/dodging gameplay in new world but the rest of new world isnt fun
[2:16:00] Redwolf_Designs: small indie company
[2:16:15] DovahChicken: did take me 106 houers to get my Hatchet to 20  so ye nerfs sucks
[2:16:19] Nirouku01: @Swifty do you still use an orbweaver or Tartarus v2?
[2:16:28] wonderwise111: why dont they just buff  other weps? so all the ppl who complains get satisfied
[2:16:39] cainz22: i used ice gauntlet and quit, confirmed
[2:16:42] DovahChicken: no but i ment the time spent on leveling weapons
[2:16:43] BenSlate: Dont you have stormstrike?
[2:16:46] DovahChicken: also using 2 hand axe LUL
[2:16:48] rbubbaray: they saying the grind for watermarks is making many quit
[2:16:48] Redwolf_Designs: @wonderwise111 woah there buddy thats too big brain for a small indie company
[2:17:03] D1rtyBurger: so their way of creating content is nerfing weapons so you have to spend time on others lol
[2:17:08] rbubbaray: yeah
[2:17:12] Katrikan: @Swifty 10% speed isnt that bad. there are still ways to catch up and lockdown ppl with GA/SnS. The charge is still there, the leap is still there and sword got no nerfs whatsoever
[2:17:20] mccoldwyn: the biggest problem in my opinion is that u literally do the same content from lvl 20 to lvl 60 same quests, same mobs same towns then u grind your gear thanks to watermark until burn out and then u done with the game
[2:17:26] Katrikan: its the gear grind that make ppl quit
[2:17:31] diabl712: watermark is horrible design
[2:17:45] rbubbaray: yup watermark each to 600
[2:17:49] baraktus: we prefer to grind honor for gears :P
[2:17:52] Nirouku01: Do you still use a keypad and mouse combo?
[2:17:57] rbubbaray: me too
[2:17:57] thamysticog: what an boring system you are never hyped after a dungeon drop cuz its trash
[2:18:19] SepticJedi: @Swifty do you think they'll ever release WoW 2?
[2:18:21] rbubbaray: ***
[2:18:32] rbubbaray: its like torghast in wow , never stops
[2:18:37] BenSlate: @Swifty can u use stormstrike?
[2:18:42] lfw002: not anymore
[2:18:44] Slydawgy1: swifty can i have your diablo 2 runes, send me a whisper please
[2:18:46] HeIlraiser_: yes they are greedy they wont be able to help themselves
[2:18:47] Redwolf_Designs: they already released wow 2 its called classic
[2:18:47] Nirouku01: Classic is WoW 2.0
[2:18:48] cainz22: you think we'll be playing classic in 15 years?
[2:18:49] ivomagnum: probably one of the reasons why people like playing classic, you know exactly what you're getting :D
