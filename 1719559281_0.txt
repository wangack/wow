[0:02:37] notadoctear: are we just starting or ending?
[0:03:14] VikingDadDevProf: @Towelliee so when are you going back to lost ark? kek
[0:13:43] abracka_: what it do
[0:15:30] abracka_: anyone doing the mage tower,  hot tip. you can use a elemental chaos potion before teleporting inside the challenge, you'll retain the 652 secondary stat buff. so you'll get a big ass stat bonus inside there since you scale down
[0:16:14] NobodybetterPat: Sup y’all
[0:16:16] abracka_: not going to make you one shot the challenge, but makes it a bit easier
[0:16:26] Bamitsjan: Do you think WoW would be hard to get into being new nowadays ?
[0:17:04] abracka_: yeah pretty much. you won't really destroy the challenge, but it def helps a lot
[0:17:49] abracka_: might have to go get that paladin/bear done finally then
[0:18:11] Rhombot: @Bamitsjan yeah... A lot of elitism in WoW, and a steep learning curve being an older game. That's my 2 cents...
[0:18:26] dropbombshel: !3090 giveaway
[0:18:43] Rhombot: Phial, right?
[0:18:47] abracka_: that's the one that stays on for 30-60 min, rotates secondary stat buffs that last 1 min each
[0:19:12] Bamitsjan: @rhombot thanks for your input

[1:09:01] evnaae: What's the best M+ way to go for prot pally, talent wise?
[1:10:40] abracka_: @officerquil you typically go seal of order build or mad paragon, the main prot talent build stays the same pretty much. seal of order is a bit of dmg + mit, mad paragon is just straight damage
