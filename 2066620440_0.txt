[2:12:24] honeyyyyyy: This is exactly why I prefer TGP. One team wins simply because of tech. It doesn't prove who's better. It just proves who has better "tech." And you know all of EU is sending all their info to support Echo. It's just degenerate
[2:12:25] tempestyn: legendary figured out how to equip corruption

[3:22:36] Zandaloriann: In a world where legends loom, there lived a guy named Dorki, in a humble room. Facing Echo, the unbeatable foe, with courage blazing, he stole the show. Dodging blows with grace and might, Dorki stood firm in the fight. With one swift move against the odds, he triumphed over Echo, the demigod.  In tales of valor, his name will ring, Dorki, the underdog, the unlikely king. For in his heart, courage did reside, proving that even giants can be defied.

[3:40:15] TDPandorum: In a world where legends loom, there lived a guy named Dorki, in a humble room. Facing Echo, the unbeatable foe, with courage blazing, he stole the show. Dodging blows with grace and might, Dorki stood firm in the fight. With one swift move against the odds, he triumphed over Echo, the demigod. In tales of valor, his name will ring, Dorki, the underdog, the unlikely king. For in his heart, courage did reside, proving that even giants can be defied.

Dodging blows with grace and might, Dorki stood firm in the fight. With one swift move against the odds, he triumphed over Echo, the demigod.  In tales of valor, his name will ring, Dorki, the underdog, the unlikely king. For in his heart, courage did reside, proving that even giants can be defied.

[3:47:51] Roseyoce: cant they get a map pick before bans or both bans for winners? They do that for some fps games because yeeh cant do multiple bo5s
[3:47:54] IoS2: It would be better if last hope got both bans on maps
[3:47:54] unholyhoit: 4
[3:47:55] gothspada: @Maximum i think he means they shoukld get some veto advantage
[3:47:56] Bartoosh: should just give them 1 map advantage
[3:47:56] mokasaurus: i do :)

[3:48:18] morkiel: @nekitamocika pay up :)
[3:48:20] Turkeypitz: why not best first to 3 wins and the upper goes in with +1 win?
[3:48:20] again20: They could just include all the dungeons in the pool and give upper bracket team 2 map bans and lower bracket team 1 ban
[3:48:25] Nox1o: nowadays game theory does the banning KEKW
[3:48:28] jeyx333: fk it I'd watch 10 back to back games of them
[3:48:29] frostieface: what happens if two teams try ban the same map
[3:48:29] MamiAlex: @unholyhoit skip if they die

[3:48:43] pnguinwow: some games do a free map win for winners
[3:48:45] g3nes: i.e. the international for example
[3:48:52] OfficialGunde: Well higher seed get match up against lesser good teams? Isnt that the  thing about being seeded higher...?

[3:48:56] worthtv: did drogoh forget about mass root
[3:48:58] antipheonixna: do u get more money?
[3:49:02] TrondVn: Getting higher seed you just get less duels basicily
[3:49:02] Druzbek: you play less games being from upper bracket, that can be a big difference
[3:49:03] procotwitch: Why no mistweavers? Is resto that much better?
[3:49:03] worthtv: Susge
[3:49:06] Bliste_: last hope never lost - echo lost once and they have no adv. over echo right its not fair this way

[3:56:00] iciunoy: @Maximum What is the build for the druid healers? Could they be putting mushrooms or somethign on the ground to get aggro after they take the dragon to get aggro after?

[3:57:39] ark_exitWound: to be fair, teams play echo close alot, they just find these "techs" to take time off (like this run) so its just free for them LUL
[3:57:46] Nox1o: @jimzyz98ttv nope
[3:57:46] Goyem: wait so they patched out the original method and echo found a way to glitch it anyway

[3:59:41] KingInos: Zaelia is out dps-ing drohgo without heart of the wild, right?
[3:59:42] windraga: @Maximum they need to make MDI where there is class bans. Seeing the same comps over and over is so bad
[3:59:43] calvin1281: Blizzard really needs to make all dungeons equal representation for Grand Finals
[3:59:46] tobaebe: tbf zaelia is gapping the hell out of drohgo in terms of dmg YAP

[4:00:37] windraga: Just give class bans. Whole classes
[4:00:37] Zingerac: @tythemediocrewowguy
[4:00:39] Nox1o: so the tech is about 2 minutes of timesave i guess
[4:00:42] Goyem: @tythemediocrewowguy not possible yeah, even a tiny difference they'd play it
[4:00:43] zynessa: @tythemediocrewowguy thats really not how the game works tho
[4:00:43] battlepotatogaming: @tythemediocrewowguy I mean, something is always going to be better right?

Dodging blows with grace and might, Dorki stood firm in the fight. With one swift move against the odds, he triumphed over Echo, the demigod.  In tales of valor, his name will ring, Dorki, the underdog, the unlikely king. For in his heart, courage did reside, proving that even giants can be defied.

[4:39:45] metel7: the scripe tweet so funny LUL
[4:39:53] mrduckytom: sacriel is on helldivers
[4:39:57] FinkTV: who runs the @TeamLiquid twitch page?
[4:40:00] Team_Spanky: Ohh @Maximum Skull and Bones is pretty shit. But you can play 8 hours of it for free. and Experience 11 Years of Development. 8 Ubisoft Studios. The culmination of YEARS of work
[4:40:01] beefy_cheez: @metel7 is it?

[4:40:33] FinkTV: @TeamLiquid @TeamLiquid damn you
[4:40:34] Drenwow: I've been in server capacity screen for the last 2 hours im losing my mind
[4:40:34] malicrin: THAT'S SO HARD
[4:40:36] unholyhoit: that's the thing, they still cheat with it KEKW
[4:40:37] malicrin: HE DOESNT GIVE A FUCK
[4:40:37] LickMyReed: @Maximum if you have any friends that are already on their ship, they can send you a steam invite and you'll get in instantly
[4:40:41] kuromebro: cheaters care
[4:40:41] SneakyWoodPecker: it’s just an excuse so they don’t have to support Linux
[4:40:45] GnarstyTV: @TeamLiquid hello Hopeful
[4:40:47] 16meda: i mean... you basically cannot use that computer for anything besides that game then
[4:40:50] TheLuo: I think it's about trusting them not to fuck with that level of access
[4:40:50] Face_32: impossible
[4:40:51] Aegrial: People who do care are fuckin weirdos
[4:40:55] ChrisHimself: That's not the point tho. Kernel level shit opens your pc up for other shit
[4:40:55] gloop1: You trust game devs way too much then @Maximum
[4:40:56] surpriseparty20: People crying about privacy while cruising on the internet is the stupidest shit ever
[4:40:58] zzzDai: Kernal level anti-cheat means that if they fuck up they can brick your pc.
[4:41:01] TheItalianStallion321: i dont have friends so im fucked
[4:41:03] TeamLiquid: @GnarstyTV hopefulSussy
[4:41:04] blazionboiii: @16meda wot hahah
[4:41:04] Bathtubtv: @Aegrial weirdos that dont want viruses on their computer
[4:41:04] zwab: Kernel level anti cheat doesnt do enough to prevent cheating to justify installing the rootkit
[4:41:05] RandaIFire: the problem is that they still can cheat
[4:41:05] Fredle: WTS Steam Invite. Only accepting WoW gold.
[4:41:09] injos: But kernel level anti cheat doesn't stop cheaters. But possible risks remain until you reinstall windows.
[4:41:09] OG_Kawngi: baseg
[4:41:11] SillySmiffy: I lost 250k points betting today :(
[4:41:12] OG_Kawngi: baseg dont care
[4:41:14] ThisIzD: Lost Fart had a lot of issues with it, which is my only experience with easy anti cheat
[4:41:16] shagamuffn: S&b endgame is just annoying af
[4:41:16] weezull: BASED
[4:41:18] 16meda: and hope to god you don't use the credentials you used on the game on ANY other account
[4:41:19] huk42: do you do banking stuff on the same PC? kernel-level anticheats are scary because they have full access to everything
[4:41:20] mrduckytom: @maximum sacriel is on i'm pretty sure you're friends with him
[4:41:22] dolletino: Downloading any game ever, opens your pc up to all kinds of shit what
[4:41:22] meckyd_: the invite trick only works if your game is closed @Maximum
[4:41:30] Taytor: If you need a yoink in I can get you in @Maximum im online
[4:41:33] rudejerk: kernel level anticheat doesn't even prevent cheating, it just gives you a false sense of security that you're not playing against anyone cheating
[4:41:36] xolossus00: i love watching people talk without having no idea what they are talking about when it comes to anti cheats XD
[4:41:36] JustDivis: @SillySmiffy yeah but just think someone else won way more than you lost!
[4:41:43] panser_nes: can i invite u, im in EU
[4:41:44] BrownSugarIsBae: i dont want no name companies having that access to my computer, but the problem with HD2 is that its anticheat doesnt allow other games to run until its uninstalled for some people. That should never happen and they need to fix it ASAP
[4:41:44] blazionboiii: bro kernel level anticheat is no different to installing a driver...
[4:41:56] MacRant: im in but the quick play doesnt work sadge
[4:42:02] Aegrial: seriously, the amount of dumb takes on this is too damn high
[4:42:06] unholyhoit: there are cheats that work anyway so what are you really gaining? @Maximum
[4:42:08] FinkTV: helldiver put out a tweet today @Maximum  saying they are trying to fix server cap
[4:42:10] OG_Kawngi: only nerds mad about kernel level anticheat
[4:42:11] Taytor: i can dm you mine
[4:42:29] billabong212: Do you think no healer is so strong because our hp pools are so low compared to our damage making tools like VE just way stronger
[4:42:33] fleks27: helldivers suffering from success (real)
[4:42:36] zebracak35: I'm guessing they cant until their partners come to work on monday

[4:44:03] gloop1: thats an insane take
[4:44:04] Docaan: People would not agree to that
[4:44:12] jjwallababy: thats insane
[4:44:13] thenateo2: most people wouldnt be ok with that
[4:44:13] vente97: that's better than kernel
[4:44:14] injos: That could actually work. And it's not kernel level
[4:44:15] PeziBear_: where the freedom then?
[4:44:15] Joneim: baseg
[4:44:20] woobackjack: completely agree, based as fuck

[4:44:23] fugawe7: That's such a dumb take

[4:44:37] zwab: @maximum - It neither makes cheats less likely nor reduces them. Giving away identifiable information just to play an online game is also a very oppressive take frankly.
[4:44:38] procotwitch: Anyone disagree just wants an unfair advantage without any hinderance KEKW
[4:44:39] vente97: ez, actual prison time for people making cheats
[4:44:39] FlutterBaby: @PeziBear_ the freedom is you don't have to play

[5:12:16] yo_its_lt: Literally took me almost 2 hours to get in. Took me a nap in the mean time. Got in right after. Just gotta wait

[5:13:32] sorliee: So whats the difference between playing last epoch now or on wednesday? Is it going to get reset or something?
[5:13:35] Taytor: yeah you can just run HD2 in the background
[5:13:36] Unius_: would you want to play wild star again btw
[5:13:40] Turkeypitz: does the game have a visible queue?
[5:13:41] Unius_: speaking of dead games
[5:13:43] gloop1: You closed it right before it was going to finally load
[5:13:44] Sephyr_tv: the retrying connection one does
[5:13:53] dahyyun: first season starts wednesday so yea its a reset
[5:13:58] sorliee: cool
[5:14:04] schougy: fwiw my helldivers is just spinning on defrosting helldiver
[5:14:04] Wil2897: love your background!
[5:14:05] ChopperYami: @Maximum Do you think we'll see anymore nerfs to Tindral and Fyrakk soon ?
[5:14:10] Turkeypitz: last epoch doesn't reset, however, a new 'season' stats - everything just goes to legacy
[5:14:10] Phatori: so what’s the premise behind Hell Divers? is it just an infinite battle against an AI?
[5:14:12] surpriseparty20: I fell asleep on that LE stream how did necro feel?
[5:14:13] MattPascual: I've heard it's not going to reset
[5:14:20] MattPascual: There will be a new season but there won't be anything special about that season
[5:14:21] N1xern: Necro looks so fun
[5:14:25] Joneim: @Maximum Have you checked out the Self found vs Merchant guild system they are implementing?
[5:14:30] shea4it: when do we get a stream of the youtube playables section
[5:14:47] Turkeypitz: you want the necro chest though - moar golems
[5:14:48] Squats3: i dont think ill play any other arpg pre season 1 again. in D4 i leveled everything up pre season 1 and just couldnt get into the seasonal mechanic after
[5:14:52] Lupusdeus: There are new classes, items, a few things, some polish and model updates but yeah, it's just finally coming out of an extended beta
[5:15:06] Turkeypitz: could farm on mage first to get chest, then go necro
[5:15:08] procotwitch: You have to link your mcdonalds rewards app account with helldivers2, then redeem 16000 rewards points to unlock the black screen
[5:15:09] CoffeeASAP: what a looker
[5:15:23] fundersaam: oo diablo
[5:15:52] maciac1: @fundersaam trust way better than diablo
[5:15:56] glitsmonk: have you looked into crafting at all?
[5:16:12] Unius_: i actually am curious about LE but i've just discovered PoE in 3.22 and still got so much to do learn in that game and i feel like i'm always gonna be disappointed by less fleshed out arpgs now
[5:16:14] CoffeeASAP: Are you able to fill the entire tree, or you only have limited points?
[5:16:14] BigRedAlpha: BigRedAlpha subscribed with Prime. 
[5:16:35] Squats3: @Maximum i really hope you get a POE2 sponsor so you will.. play it
[5:16:37] OSHate: what's this game?
[5:16:39] Turkeypitz: try a blade dancer for lols - its pretty fun!!
[5:16:43] kingrhodo: What is it called?
[5:16:43] OG_Kawngi: @OSHate Last Epoch

[5:17:26] TheLuo: Man every time I heard the GGG devs talk about POE 2 I keep feeling like it's leaning HARD into the D4 simplicity and I reeeeeeally thing that's a mistake.
[5:17:32] Lupusdeus: Have you got into crafting much yet Max?
[5:17:49] Joneim: @TheLuo Bro you have not seen the weapon swap and skill tree swap tech then
[5:18:00] luxumbra69: what game is this
[5:18:09] pewpewfluffy: what game is this?
[5:18:11] Lupusdeus: I've played every class a fair amount and there are so many fun specs TBF, the skill trees for the abilities really open it up
[5:18:16] sorliee: Whats the last epoch endgame looking like? I heard from someone its kinda barebones rn
[5:18:19] Rapunzele: @Maximum your title says world of warcraft
[5:18:21] Hugosuave: wait take ur chest back @Maximum
