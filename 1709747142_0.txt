[0:35:08] Kaype92: the problem isn't that the servers get fixed, the problem is that they can't seem to prevent it after they 'fix' it. 3rd time in 2 weeks just shows they don't know how to fix the issue

[1:30:03] Daismoon: Tampa looking old
[1:30:06] CMack_72: That Buc defense was just out of this world
[1:30:10] TheEarthBringer: Brady needs to either retire or go into coaching
[1:30:12] dutchie76: kicker so bad they went for it on 4th and 4 lol

[1:30:42] dutchie76: chefs defense aint that great
[1:30:47] dutchie76: swiss cheese

[1:31:28] Gr3veN: well. RIP Lisa-Marie <3
[1:31:32] protocols_: That and giants didn’t have their top 3 defenders both times they played philly
[1:31:46] trayiedor: you feel like 15. maybe check to see if it has been 15 lol
[1:31:48] Spaztastico: Cowboys will run niners wopnt be close.  sorry i want niners to win but Cowboys on a role now
[1:32:00] protocols_: <—— die hard giants fan

[1:33:22] The_Marijuana_NA: spice melange
[1:33:23] draigh10: @Spaztastico against the number one defense in the NFL? dak also has the most interceptions in the league
[1:33:26] mavericks312: i think its safe to say whoever comes out the nfc is losing to the AFC
[1:33:29] MayroVision: No one, he’s a Michigan man too!
[1:33:33] JasperXIII: only thing that sucks about the cowboys winning is we get to hear we them boys and its are year haha

[1:34:27] metavahn231: GJ indie company
[1:34:28] NetherRegion: Dallas been beating bad teams all year towSip
[1:34:29] protocols_: If jax beats KC they going to the SB probably because Cinci and Buffalo looked like hell in both their first rounders I think
[1:34:36] MayroVision: Cowboys fans are the alliance players of WoW. Lame and annoying
[1:34:50] Gr3veN: Wayne Gretzy
