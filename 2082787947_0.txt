[0:20:15] reggieface420: blizzard really like accelerating the legendary rates
[0:20:32] reggieface420: valanyr is like a 5 week grind too if u can find someone to do it
[0:21:02] Annagoeslive: i really wonder what arena s5-s8 would look like if every PVE piece was diabled, how classes would kind of "scale" on just pvp gear and how good/bad comps would get
[0:21:52] codenamegim: no trinkets like solace too?
[0:21:59] reggieface420: i guess classes that use the least pve gear but are still good would be top dogs
[0:22:03] Annagoeslive: yeah
[0:22:15] Annagoeslive: 0 solace nothing just pvp
[0:22:18] notmorbos: @Annagoeslive anything that wants strength or agi would be just super bad
[0:22:21] notmorbos: itd just be caster meta
[0:22:30] CropsFarm: Solace is game breaking
[0:22:48] Annagoeslive: @notmorbos hmm
[0:23:00] CropsFarm: Healers might actually go oom w/o Solace
[0:23:07] Annagoeslive: yea for sure
[0:23:33] Annagoeslive: i believe some specs would be bad for sure, would need some tuning i guess (in pvp) specific pvp changes
[0:23:38] notmorbos: they fucked up the pvp pieces in wrath, neck, cloak, rings dont have agi/str. thats why we have to wear pvp in all these slots
[0:23:58] notmorbos: also melee trinkets were significantly better than caster trinkets i think
[0:24:13] CropsFarm: Not DFO tho
[0:24:14] notmorbos: uhhh we had a bit of a demon queue yday and are like 2.9 now
