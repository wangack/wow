[0:50:16] CygnusC: everything is at least viable
[0:50:16] hxzcc: its not that bad i think
[0:50:18] sycaway: wc2 so based
[0:50:19] N_Tys: its better than you expect
[0:50:23] abruptdecayO_O: raid - statistics

[0:50:57] enderstreak: Is this retail???
[0:50:57] DINGODOGGERDUDE: not bad
[0:50:58] Rykor09: unless your a hunter
[0:51:01] johnnyhopkinwead1: thats why its shit, so homogenized
[0:51:02] Moo360: because every retail class is a generator/spender
[0:51:03] NotTheWheel: so everyone is pretty good
[0:51:03] osopolar1977: go arcane Baja blasts
[0:51:05] orangemaple24: too balanced imo

[0:51:39] Zakuras: Theres always some cheese strats on heroics
[0:51:40] Moo360: they made every dps class a generator / spender so they're all basically the same just with different graphics so it's not super shocking
[0:51:42] enderstreak: Looks really good ngl
[0:51:43] NotTheWheel: not bad
[0:51:51] Deomas11: But all classes are very similar in retail
[0:51:55] TheEndIsNear777: pvp on the other hand peepoSad

[0:52:29] DINGODOGGERDUDE: wouldn't say balanced but not bad
[0:52:45] yarzzy: More spells and cross functionality pepeP
[0:52:54] Zakuras: @DINGODOGGERDUDE when like 20 specs are within 10% its balanced
[0:52:58] TheEndIsNear777: @DINGODOGGERDUDE its better than bfa that's for sure hehe. but your right its okay i just lack gear and i don't want to arena xd
[0:53:09] AdamShwaginz: true
[0:53:22] hxzcc: real and true, and sod is turning into that too LUL

[0:59:04] DINGODOGGERDUDE: yeah I don't care
[0:59:08] AdamShwaginz: amen
[0:59:09] Spanos_: I'll watch the movie
[0:59:12] carlos_the_7th: To be fair, this "heavy addon" gameplay is pleasurable only to 1% of the retail community, most people are hella sick of it
[0:59:15] gotcha2157: i think dragonflgith pvp is decent rn
[0:59:16] Zakuras: There are limits. I skipped Dragon Soul because it was ultimate garbage
[0:59:21] sweatlordkush: mythic+ killed wow

[0:59:42] TheEndIsNear777: Blizzard: "Hi we have an offer so you can come back and make us great again" Metzen: "Name your price" Blizzard: "100 million dollars!" <---This is how it went down
[0:59:49] hairfair88: At least Danauser is gone
[0:59:56] sweatlordkush: mythic+ made the game into an esport
[1:00:04] Trodenskjold: @hairfair88 Sadge no more Jailer
[1:00:21] abruptdecayO_O: gw2 ui OMEGALUL
[1:00:32] DINGODOGGERDUDE: I like pikaboo he runs almost standard ui

[1:02:07] DINGODOGGERDUDE: a beer??
[1:02:09] goodgameYUMMY: there is a part about this in the epic video "why its rude to be bad at world of warcraft"
[1:02:21] NotTheWheel: Doesn't help in base Retail you got no visual queues of what is doing what
[1:02:27] JohnDelanoRoosevelt: I was gonna watch this but now I can watch Staysafe watching Asmon watching it, all the bases covered.
[1:02:32] larnsmarf: as someone who was binged SOD for the last month and a half. who then decided to play retail for two days. i am a new player to wow. they are two completely different games.
[1:02:34] NutterCircus: I have a hard time believing the devs play the game.

[1:02:44] LoRswat: Shadow Hunter
[1:02:45] novvum: They intended it in Vanilla
[1:02:47] sweatlordkush: because the wow devs are furries and weebs now
[1:02:52] NotTheWheel: because they hate us and don't want us to be happy
[1:02:54] AntarcticTreaty: 🇨🇳
[1:02:55] seymourmoney: Having a caster DK would have been cool
[1:03:00] wsim9: bones are banned in china
[1:03:01] nerunehru: probably a no go in china, they have to redo all of the undead models for china to no show bones

[1:09:40] 4ddic7: Also unfuck the graphics
[1:09:42] r0xorzb0xorz: YEP I am very retarded sir
[1:09:42] Trodenskjold: M+ is the best thing in retail
[1:09:43] Lava_in_a_Lamp: No. Theres nothing making you do the hardest stuff
[1:09:43] goodgameYUMMY: WoW would be better but the community would never allow for it because they like to min max
[1:09:43] Slaanesh74: YEP
[1:09:46] novvum: Just Sweaty is to boring
[1:09:47] daywalker1014: yupp
[1:09:47] TheWhiteRabbitxX: Wow has always been a game for casual players just because people used to play at hard-core doesn’t mean it wasn’t a casual game that’s where they went wrong
[1:09:48] AxelFromAustralia: someone needs to make a standalone game that emelates m+ to get rid of the sweatiest
[1:09:48] CygnusC: the base is already sweaty
[1:09:49] DINGODOGGERDUDE: I legit play retail arena, it's still ok
[1:09:49] hxzcc: mythic + is the only thing u do if u dont raid
[1:09:49] Wildstar_Player: allowing players to up the difficulty is just more fun as some1 who has done both
[1:09:50] TheEndIsNear777: i got old man reflexes peepoSad
[1:09:50] batmern_: mythic raiding is not fun idc what people say
[1:09:50] seymourmoney: I think the mythic dungeon system is one of the best things in the game
[1:09:51] JohnDelanoRoosevelt: unfuck the graphics hell yeah
[1:09:51] Sunderwire_: I would never do mythic but they shouldn’t remove it
[1:09:52] googz_ow: keep it but get rid of addons
[1:09:53] crumbler81: 1 or 2 difficulties at most
[1:09:53] desweck: I like hard content, I just don't like the retail aesthetic and failure of world building
[1:09:55] MajesticAFx: i play hardcore. i want it more difficult
[1:09:56] castond: mythic difficulty is not even close to the problem
[1:10:00] caltex88: Its past time for WOW 2
[1:10:00] AxelFromAustralia: ban all addons
[1:10:02] LoRswat: went from supportive to Gaslighting in an instant LUL
[1:10:03] jay_deetv: wow needs fewer buttons
[1:10:03] goodgameYUMMY: I wonder how many sweaty players there are vs well hydrated players
[1:10:05] sweatlordkush: make the raids two difficulties and eliminate mythic+
[1:10:07] NutterCircus: Not interested in learning the Lore behind a new button. DansGame
[1:10:08] coolcrazyguy72: AI NPC that you can talk to with your voice
[1:10:09] TheEndIsNear777: Not fast enough not brainy enough not combat savy enough to be top dps on mythic 30 peepoSad
[1:10:13] sxarthur: i'd like mythic if it had queues
[1:10:13] Spanos_: my guild still struggles in Ruby Sanctum so yeah
[1:10:13] DINGODOGGERDUDE: idc about retail pve at all
[1:10:19] jay_deetv: check out the video that Venruki has about the arcane mage rotation
[1:10:22] DINGODOGGERDUDE: pvp is ok still
[1:10:27] Slaanesh74: retail isn't all that bad. the player base is just way too fragmented.
[1:10:43] hxzcc: guild 4500 total kills wtf
[1:10:49] sweatlordkush: bruh
[1:10:50] IR_ish: KEKW
[1:10:53] crumbler81: KEKW
[1:10:54] jay_deetv: @dingodoggerdude pvp is totally gatekept. there are 0 new players because the learning curve is insanely high
[1:10:56] NotTheWheel: 414 groups?
[1:10:59] NotTheWheel: wtf
[1:10:59] coolcrazyguy72: Raid mounts that sit 40 players
[1:11:00] Sardaco: yo 7pm server we need a boomy. sent you pm on discord
[1:11:00] NotTheWheel: lol
[1:11:01] theboosh7: Whole reward system needs rework, fk the vault
[1:11:02] andyjamesgames: any mythic andys in the chat?
[1:11:07] LoRswat: first 3 bosses are 1 shots....usually
[1:11:08] Etny2k: 1948
[1:11:11] wavecadet: thats crazy
[1:11:12] TheEndIsNear777: mythic = 20 minute fight, 15 mins 1 shot mechanic wipe whole raid GG K THX XD
[1:11:15] wavecadet: fuck that
[1:11:22] goodgameYUMMY: only 40 groups? 10/per group right?
[1:11:22] DINGODOGGERDUDE: @jay_deetv agreed, I've been playing priest for 6 years or so
[1:11:30] DINGODOGGERDUDE: learning curve is rough
[1:11:31] TheWhiteRabbitxX: @slaanesh74 retail is for mount collecting and xmogs. all progression no matter what is zero’d out totally with every new patch. it’s fucked
[1:11:41] IR_ish: yea makes sense
[1:11:54] TuDeFrAnS: This is so meta... I'm watching a guy, who is watching a guy, that is watching a guy... where did I go wrong man xD
[1:11:56] hxzcc: 20
[1:12:07] coolcrazyguy72: RTS NEW battleground where 1 guy has god perspective and orders 10 players around the BG
[1:12:28] seymourmoney: Divide by 3. I don't think many people would play more characters than that
[1:12:33] IR_ish: does it have a raidfinder bracket?
[1:12:35] fietsopa4: SoD will be on life support when Cata is out
[1:12:42] jay_deetv: @dingodoggerdude good on you man. a major deciding factor for me switching to SoD from retail was that I just can’t PvP after not doing it for years.
[1:12:43] CrixVibez: A lot of ppl don't raid as well. THeyr'e collectors, or Mythic + only, etc
[1:12:50] crumbler81: this is why I really like the FF14 raids, basically just heroic difficulty and mythic is just for cosmetics
[1:12:59] johnnyhopkinwead1: do you like BFD better than Gnomer>?
[1:13:00] coolcrazyguy72: role playing tab where you can have a bio, relationship status, ect….
[1:13:03] goodgameYUMMY: 237580
[1:13:09] StaysafeTV: 237580
[1:13:36] CygnusC: retail has a 7 day lockout no?
[1:13:43] DINGODOGGERDUDE: @jay_deetv yeah I can see that, I've just stuff with one class/spec over the years on retail
[1:14:05] coolcrazyguy72: boob slider
[1:14:05] OptimusBanana420: what about HLK?
[1:14:05] DINGODOGGERDUDE: played rogue for a bit
[1:14:18] IR_ish: now how many characters have cleared the mythic raid Kappa
[1:14:19] DINGODOGGERDUDE: 2k ish rating nothing crazy
[1:14:28] abruptdecayO_O: theres 4 difficulties
[1:14:31] CrixVibez: Look at M+ bodies
[1:14:33] Deamp: isn´t that guilds, shouldn´t we look at ironforge pro
[1:14:37] Ruinx81: Raiding in retail does off pretty quickly
[1:14:42] CrixVibez: a ton of ppl do that
[1:14:44] itsXekko: you don't even need to raid at all in retail, you can gear in m+
[1:14:45] N_Tys: M+ numbers are nutty
[1:14:47] novvum: Yep tons do that
[1:14:48] Lava_in_a_Lamp: mythic+ way beter than raiding
[1:14:49] N_Tys: 1M+
[1:14:54] Slaanesh74: the community is stratified over several different levels
[1:14:55] CrixVibez: Nah like a SHIT TON of ppl only M+
[1:14:59] aleck1776: NOPERS
[1:14:59] AxelFromAustralia: m+ way way higher
[1:14:59] soix__: i know many people who only do M+
[1:15:06] wiggleztv: most people i know who play retail only do M+
[1:15:10] CrixVibez: yo dont need to raid for M+ after farming up like the 1-2 items that you need. like trinks
[1:15:15] TheWhiteRabbitxX: there are actually a lot of people that only do M+ .. to be fair
[1:15:16] hxzcc: i used to be like that
[1:15:17] Slaanesh74: that was me for a long time
[1:15:20] Sunderwire_: I do m+ but don’t raid
[1:15:23] RalfundFlorian: I do
[1:15:25] CrixVibez: ^^
[1:15:27] N_Tys: its 100% a thing.
[1:15:28] OptimusBanana420: not everyone logs in sod, your boomkin doesn't have logs from that monday run
[1:15:33] harpR19: there was 1.2m runs last week
[1:15:33] bigbuttpotatoes: i only m+ and no raids haha
[1:15:34] tussmack: there are people who dont raid mythic for sure, but my guess everyone who does m+ does heroic raid atleast
[1:15:37] Lava_in_a_Lamp: M+ is very fun.
[1:15:38] TheWhiteRabbitxX: I only did M+ and never raided when I played retail last.. a couple years ago
[1:15:41] Robbtuck: my dad plays retail and he doesn’t raid. just m+
[1:15:41] wavecadet: check raider io probably
[1:15:52] CrixVibez: M+ is mjuch more popular than raiding
[1:15:54] NotTheWheel: I don't play retail but I believe the big thing people do is m+ all the time
[1:15:59] AxelFromAustralia: check raiderio
[1:16:08] abruptdecayO_O: 1.2m 5 mans
[1:16:13] TuDeFrAnS: M+ is the only reason to play retail.. M+ 20-25 can be sorted by peoples raider.io and some planning.. raiding requires much more time (time is important for the boomer dad gamer!)
[1:16:14] harpR19: dungeon runs
[1:16:19] Kroski: But keep in mind you can spam them all day long
[1:16:20] CrixVibez: @TuDeFrAnS exactly
[1:16:23] Ruinx81: Multiple runs tho
[1:16:26] skaate: but it's repeatable no?
[1:16:31] jbroni: I only m+ raiding is awful in retail and honestly a big waste of time with the exception of trinkets/wep. I’m 3k+ rated and almost never raid
[1:16:32] bigbuttpotatoes: samw
[1:16:35] TheWhiteRabbitxX: m+ is easy since you only need 5 people and a lot of people have regular groups every day where it’s the same people all day
[1:16:38] CrixVibez: YOu only do raid to farm your trinket/weap, etc, then you dont need to do raids
[1:16:46] CrixVibez: a day* lol
[1:16:55] hxzcc: you need to do 10 atleast if u want full vault LUL
[1:16:58] Trodenskjold: Maybe its just 5 people who did 1.2m runs :O
[1:17:13] CrixVibez: @Trodenskjold ther's people that do runs all day everyday of the week
[1:17:16] jay_deetv: without a guild mythic + is soooo much easier to form a group for, and you don’t need to commit like 1/4 of the time
[1:17:25] BleedzUK: are there bots doing full clears in retail?
[1:17:30] coolcrazyguy72: battle royal battleground
[1:17:44] madgarlicjr: these guys are good at food analogies
[1:17:52] AxelFromAustralia: over 300k accounts have keystone master
[1:17:57] NotTheWheel: It's scary what fat people consider... "healthy" lol
[1:18:00] NotTheWheel: sorry
[1:18:05] phob1a_go_brrr: @StaysafeTV There are 5,067,765 unique characters for DF season 3 on raider.io
[1:18:08] lizcat_: YEP
[1:18:11] coolcrazyguy72: zombie survival dungeon
[1:18:12] Sunderwire_: hell no LUL
[1:18:13] MajesticAFx: nah
[1:18:15] lizcat_: it’s too much
[1:18:17] sweatlordkush: yesss
[1:18:20] Slaanesh74: they won't do that. there's too much inertia in the game
[1:18:20] skaate: wow 2 Pog
[1:18:23] lizcat_: all the old currencies etc
[1:18:24] hxzcc: that is true, but it also makes it unique
[1:18:24] martelskiy: agree
[1:18:25] JohnDelanoRoosevelt: if they reset things now, it would never be anything like the Warcraft we know
[1:18:33] BobLongMVP: true
[1:18:33] NotTheWheel: yep
[1:18:34] N_Tys: if they reset, I'm done. peace.
[1:18:36] madgarlicjr: i think the answer is to just stop making expansion and let people catch up
[1:18:36] fietsopa4: MY TOYS MY MOUNTS NOOOOO
[1:18:39] IR_ish: i bet
[1:18:42] iMattbat: Sunken cost trikes again
[1:18:46] tussmack: chatting with the boys
[1:18:47] lizcat_: time has been invested
[1:18:49] N_Tys: YEP
[1:18:50] QuestFor420: right
[1:18:51] madgarlicjr: YEP
[1:18:52] CrixVibez: Keysss
[1:18:53] wramel: YEP
[1:18:53] TheWhiteRabbitxX: they would get fomo for new collections especially when everyone jumps ship
[1:18:54] abruptdecayO_O: i mean the core gameplay is fun m+ rules
[1:19:01] itsXekko: very true
[1:19:03] einself111: they think all the shit they collect has any value, it is so cringe KEKL
[1:19:05] bignerdtv: blizzard will never do a full reset, they dont want their subs to lose their time infestment
[1:19:07] madgarlicjr: you got to just quit cold  turkey
[1:19:10] Trodenskjold: For sure
[1:19:12] Ruinx81: That’s just a take from someone who doesn’t like it. personally find retail gameplay great
[1:19:21] N_Tys: yep, I have no interest starting an mmo from scratch again.
[1:19:22] TheWhiteRabbitxX: Asmon did it and he had the biggest collection when he did basically
[1:19:30] AxelFromAustralia: 3.3 million unique characters running m+ in season 3
[1:19:31] TheWhiteRabbitxX: but yeah it would be hard for some
[1:19:31] NotTheWheel: The game would have to quit before they did
[1:19:42] Zolshy89: yes
[1:19:49] Slaanesh74: definitely
[1:19:51] imperiuz02: yes
[1:19:52] bignerdtv: yes
[1:19:52] TuDeFrAnS: Yeah
[1:19:52] Zolshy89: your take is wrong
[1:19:52] N_Tys: 100%
[1:19:52] AxelFromAustralia: yes everyone
[1:19:53] littlehak: yea
[1:19:54] MajesticAFx: i dont think a reset is needed
[1:19:55] Sunderwire_: THEY WOULD
[1:19:56] Empiricol: for sure
[1:19:57] voketo7: he just wants wow 2. they would not "reset" the game after many expacs
[1:19:57] madgarlicjr: people would lose their shit
[1:19:57] jiggeritus: iight  im out
[1:19:59] sycaway: some would start
[1:20:02] indocl0ud: a lot of people would probable be relieved honestly
[1:20:02] madgarlicjr: literally
[1:20:04] Zolshy89: never going to happen
[1:20:06] NotTheWheel: yea
[1:20:06] caekester: I think a lot of people would quit for sure but I also new people would join
[1:20:06] Mahca_: maybe thats what they need though
[1:20:08] CrixVibez: There's also a giga ton of ppl who just play to do the collectors shit as well.
[1:20:09] Kebabra_: Need to throw out fresh servers in a different tab like classic does
[1:20:09] AxelFromAustralia: I’d be relieved
[1:20:11] TheWhiteRabbitxX: I bet they would keep playing after watching twitch streamers play
[1:20:11] Slaanesh74: sure. a lot of people would try it.
[1:20:13] aleck1776: YEP New people would come into the fold
[1:20:13] NotTheWheel: I'd comeback
[1:20:18] relvap: same
[1:20:20] TheWhiteRabbitxX: yeah for sure
[1:20:22] aleck1776: Then youll get the oldies back eventually
[1:20:26] OptimusBanana420: i would at least try it
[1:20:26] TheWhiteRabbitxX: I’d play again
[1:20:28] ZhangTuShi: an arena player i think using cc dr is a bad example of complexity. i like drs
[1:20:34] Trodenskjold: I would quit for sure if the reset it
[1:20:38] voketo7: wait until dragonflght classic then :D
[1:20:41] IR_ish: if they do a reset, they must charge more money and hire people to get rid of the bots
[1:20:46] Zolshy89: There are more ppl playing the game than would come back no?
[1:20:50] bignerdtv: blizzard never reset MMR in OW and HotS bcz the were afraid to mass lose popularity
[1:20:50] CrixVibez: so many ppl would quit
[1:20:56] TheWhiteRabbitxX: so long term it would be better to reset it  because of new players
[1:20:58] Zolshy89: The ppl that would come back are playing class and sod
[1:20:59] Slaanesh74: it doesn't bother me to lose the account. I just play for the player interaction
[1:20:59] ZhangTuShi: i would quit at a reset of wow.
[1:21:08] lizcat_: classic ruined retail for me
[1:21:20] MolonvLabe: wow retail is too much
[1:21:22] karmakid2020: @ZhangTuShi youre a nerd for playing retail
[1:21:25] sweatlordkush: dont need a reset, just get rid of mythic difficulty
[1:21:29] AxelFromAustralia: I haven’t touched retail since sod came out as someone who played 50+ hours per week
[1:21:31] NotTheWheel: To put in perspective.... Even Asmon isn't playing for mounts anymore
[1:21:41] TheWhiteRabbitxX: If you’re talking, two or three years, yes, resetting it doesn’t make sense if you’re talking 10 or 20 more years resetting it makes more sense because you’ll get a whole new generation of players
[1:21:43] IR_ish: it's not even a rollplaying game
[1:22:03] OGFonzi: I feel like Blizz took a page out of Runescape book.. Runescape recreated OSRS and OSRS is strong.. WoW is now following suit.
[1:22:07] sweatlordkush: YEP
[1:22:07] hxzcc: yes, me
[1:22:08] wavecadet: Yes
[1:22:08] IR_ish: the underdog
[1:22:09] AxelFromAustralia: yes
[1:22:10] bignerdtv: a full reset wil never happen. reatil WoW players are to large (e.g. subs)
[1:22:10] Slaanesh74: I don't think it's the way the characters play as much as it is the fact that there's no guild cohesion
[1:22:10] desweck: yes
[1:22:11] N_Tys: yep
[1:22:11] IR_ish: i do that
[1:22:12] wiggleztv: Quin
[1:22:12] jameserush1: Yes
[1:22:13] Krabue: ofc
[1:22:13] iBanEvader: 100%

[1:22:14] Sunderwire_: Esfand KEKW
[1:22:15] fietsopa4: every ret paladin
[1:22:16] Sabre_Wulf: and they wanna try to make it work
[1:22:21] Atb50: YES
[1:22:21] skaate: it's rollplaying, not roleplaying tho
[1:22:21] the_do0d: shockadins
[1:22:21] Trodenskjold: McConnell
[1:22:22] Mahca_: esfand LUL
[1:22:22] mybaddude: I am one of them!
[1:22:25] endraga1: the diamond in the rough
[1:22:26] Maxifrog: Wheelchair spec

[1:22:27] AxelFromAustralia: I love getting keystone hero on the non meta clases it’s fun
[1:22:28] r0xorzb0xorz: one guy in my classic guild played ret paladin and shadow priest
[1:22:31] SpicyMango26: esfandW
[1:22:31] Thrive1423: and boomy lol
[1:22:31] TheWhiteRabbitxX: everyone likes the underdog… because if you’re bad, you have an easy excuse
[1:22:33] FryeTV: They dont currently suck this is their moment lmao
[1:22:38] FryeTV: ret pala
[1:22:40] Lava_in_a_Lamp: Ret paladins spready holy democracy.
[1:22:44] IR_ish: #utility
[1:22:44] Mahca_: thats me on my druid in vanilla honestly
[1:22:46] mybaddude: Underdog mentality. 100% a thing
[1:22:48] DrAAKaos: "toxic casual"
[1:22:48] siilver40: <3
[1:22:52] Ruinx81: Ok now I’m getting PMd that I should “go eff myself” for just having a discussion with you about it. What is wrong with people
[1:22:56] hxzcc: it feels good when ure f tier spec and doing better than s tie spec, its like parsing high almost
[1:22:58] Robbtuck: and mages are Chad alpha males
[1:23:12] Zolshy89: balance in classic was worse
[1:23:28] sweatlordkush: i like when my class is bad
[1:23:44] zVaall: gaming cucks
[1:23:47] vill4franca: true
[1:23:51] Zolshy89: I mean same thing in retail
[1:23:58] iMattbat: The majority of people probably just pick what looks fun to them and the results are what they are
[1:23:58] LoRswat: everyone is created equal in retail
[1:24:01] AceOfFlame: oh yes you do, try top dmg as WW atm, you wont and you will SUCK at dmg hard
[1:24:03] Slaanesh74: like in TBC I loved prot warrior tanking, because it felt rewarding to do well
[1:24:04] skaate: they are the result of a traumatic childhood just like me :)
[1:24:25] sixpackchad: @StaysafeTV Just imagine being Pierce Brosnan's wife on her wedding night, expecting romance, but instead he disappears for an hour. When he returns, he has buckets full of ice cream. She gets on the bed, but instead Pierce grabs a comically large scoop and starts feeding more and more, the words FULL FAT on each new flavor dancing in his eyes. Her slumber is broken by the smell of french toast. His project is just beginning.
[1:24:28] sweatlordkush: LUL
[1:24:40] r0xorzb0xorz: I mained hunter in vanilla classic because it was nice not being the dps meta where the community is not full of sweatlord losers like warrior
[1:24:42] LoRswat: BrownBoys are number 1
[1:24:42] CygnusC: go to naxx
[1:24:43] sweatlordkush: we need cuck specs
[1:24:44] bone555: KEKW KEKW  󠀀
[1:24:45] jbroni: in retail. if your spec sucks you don’t get invited. in classic at least you usually offer some sort of buff or reason to bring your class
[1:24:48] Sardaco: @StaysafeTV do you need a raid for tonight gnomer? 7pm server time
[1:25:00] hxzcc: lmao
[1:25:00] littlehak: KEKW
[1:25:05] NotTheWheel: Warriors based
[1:25:06] StompingBox: KEKW
[1:25:09] einself111: shows that balance has nothing to do with fun
[1:25:16] Zolshy89: not in retail
[1:25:24] DrRazamataz: that ele shaman variance
[1:25:26] NotTheWheel: LUL
[1:25:27] AceOfFlame: thats pretty sad
[1:25:34] Zolshy89: maybe like ppl play certain specs
[1:25:41] desweck: 9pm est
[1:25:44] Sardaco: yes we need a boomy
[1:25:54] wavecadet: EZ Content
[1:25:55] aleck1776: HES IN BOYS
[1:25:55] StaysafeTV: I WILLL BE THERE
[1:25:59] sixpackchad: @StaysafeTV Just imagine being Pierce Brosnan's wife on her wedding night, expecting romance, but instead he disappears for an hour. When he returns, he has buckets full of ice cream. She gets on the bed, but instead Pierce grabs a comically large scoop and starts feeding more and more, the words FULL FAT on each new flavor dancing in his eyes. Her slumber is broken by the smell of french toast. His project is just beginning.
[1:26:01] helmetnach0s: LFGGGG
[1:26:02] OptimusBanana420: EZ
[1:26:09] Sardaco: great i slotted you in the roster!
[1:26:13] sweatlordkush: LUL
[1:26:13] Etny2k: stay boomer my friend
[1:26:25] cheetobbob: I pump on my boomy. im always top 3
[1:26:31] NotTheWheel: POG
[1:26:42] TuDeFrAnS: The problem isnt really the balance or the lack of balance... most of us were kids when we started playing it, and wasn't min/maxing this hard. Wasn't checking BiS gear and builds - at least no to the extend people do now. And all the min/maxing and speed farming is ruining the gaming experience
[1:26:51] helmetnach0s: just set a calendar reminder
[1:26:53] Robbtuck: fire mage is sooo fun rn on sod
[1:26:59] coolcrazyguy72: blizzard should design a device that emits electromagnetic energy and gives the player a deeper feeling of enjoying the game. not feeling like a real wizard? turn on the machine and FEEL like your a wizard
[1:27:00] MajesticAFx: ^
[1:27:24] Omahasteaks: this is inception
[1:27:26] NotTheWheel: Class skins sounds so strange
[1:27:40] larpycoperstein: wtf is a class skin
[1:27:43] hxzcc: ahhh... idk if im a fan of more buttons/abilities
[1:27:47] NotTheWheel: yeah why not
[1:28:01] yarzzy: Midnight will be ABSOLUTE Quel'Thalas KINO
[1:28:09] seymourmoney: wait, player housing?
[1:28:22] Ruinx81: SoD is starting to get some button bloat already
[1:28:24] OptimusBanana420: it's way too bloated at this point
[1:28:37] sweatlordkush: it is impossible
[1:28:39] Zolshy89: do you have to have everything
[1:28:42] jbroni: half the stuff you can’t even get anymore
[1:28:45] Omgwtfipwndu: way too bloated with dumb af achievements
[1:28:48] NotTheWheel: true
[1:28:51] NotTheWheel: too much
[1:28:53] Lava_in_a_Lamp: Its so much you literally have to spend years to do it all
[1:29:01] cyonara74: @StaysafeTV i dont like removed mounts, pets, toys, etc
[1:29:06] jbroni: the amount of times I see something coool only to find out it’s literally unobtainable basically makes me not want to play the game
[1:29:12] r0xorzb0xorz: every time I think of unobtainable pvp elite sets I get pissed
[1:29:25] kelvystorm: hi staysafe hi chat :)
[1:29:33] Etny2k: I havent played wow in a year you are keeping wow alive for me
[1:29:38] Mightyhal: Clap
[1:29:39] Zolshy89: its doesnt matter
[1:29:46] MajesticAFx: true but still ab 100k people still actively play as far as i understand
[1:29:49] larpycoperstein: what is a class skin ?
[1:29:50] AceOfFlame: dont think thats true, more people played in DF then in SL
[1:29:51] dtl78: KEKW
[1:29:51] Zolshy89: cuz you wont play the game
[1:29:51] Maxifrog: you're game is shit kek
[1:29:51] einself111: but they rather listen to liquid and eccho players than causal feedback KEKW
[1:29:52] HeIlraiser_: NICE
[1:29:52] hxzcc: im giga not excited for the war within, i wish it would be different
[1:29:52] helmetnach0s: BASED
[1:29:59] sigilfish: i would like to have fun game to play
[1:30:00] daywalker1014: bellar is known to complain way too much
[1:30:08] Zolshy89: I used to watch you long ago
[1:30:10] arcantio123: do we have the player #s for retail?
[1:30:15] Zolshy89: it is just annoying all the retail hate
[1:30:15] hedgedx: do you think 60 raids will be harder?
[1:30:17] OptimusBanana420: classic is more of a social game
[1:30:29] aligned1: @Zolshy89 then leave KEKW
[1:30:30] AceOfFlame: I quit 2019 classic because i wanted more of a challenge at the time...now im just playing sod KEKW
[1:30:31] sweatlordkush: the retail defense force
[1:30:35] Eviltuna13: i gave up on Sod not because im not enjoying it but because it will end and all that time gone when they wipe the servers
[1:30:37] NotTheWheel: I think we found out why asmon got people mad
[1:30:46] yarzzy: @Zolshy89 FeelsOkayMan free to hate
[1:30:48] IR_ish: you critique what i like ?! pvpFATTERZ it's a personal ATTACK
[1:30:49] Zolshy89: I mean you are getting paid to hate on it
[1:30:57] VegaCP: He's a boomer who has sunkcost fallacy
[1:31:07] cheetobbob: retail is trash. just the way it is
[1:31:10] sigilfish: monkaHmm
[1:31:22] Etny2k: I will pay for that
[1:31:24] cheetobbob: @Zolshy89 HotPokket BabyRage
[1:31:24] hxzcc: Susge
[1:31:26] fietsopa4: I'm subbing because you hate retail
[1:31:26] helmetnach0s: KEKW KEKW KEKW
[1:31:28] mikyki: just ban the retard
[1:31:28] obstata: he just hit u with the "i know you are but what am i?"
[1:31:29] unscconnor2: retail talk today i see
[1:31:29] markja629: talking about something = hating on it
[1:31:32] CygnusC: critique = hate apparently
[1:31:32] ear_shot: heeeess consoooooming
[1:31:33] LunaMoonCakey: retail is good
[1:31:38] Mahca_: Susage he is retail
[1:31:38] r0xorzb0xorz: I hate on retail because I want it to be better
[1:31:38] HeIlraiser_: retail is retail, why does classic have be retail when its classic + new stuff
[1:31:41] Zolshy89: that's fine
[1:31:43] AceOfFlame: TES
[1:31:44] arcantio123: YOU HATE RETAIL ADMIT IT STAYSAFE WE'VE GOT YOU CORNERED
[1:31:44] kaiju_kin: typical internet "hater" "glazer" extremism
[1:31:45] einself111: Madge
[1:31:47] Trodenskjold: Madge how dare you hate coke
[1:31:48] spookshow6: reee
[1:31:50] dirk_Sora: Madge wtf?
[1:31:51] HrdScp: make retail better so less people complain
[1:31:52] sigilfish: i hope it does because i like pepsi and its superior soda
[1:31:52] Slaanesh74: tribalism
[1:31:56] castond: Zolshy locked into retail due to sunk cost fallacy confirmed
[1:31:57] LunaMoonCakey: retail good you boomers lol
[1:31:58] MajesticAFx: coke is goated
[1:31:58] cafrozed: no, but those mountain dew drinkers are the worst people
[1:31:58] tampaESPORTS: Cheer500 this is payment for your retail hating content. thank you
[1:31:59] endraga1: pepsi is better tho 100%
[1:32:01] DrFeelgood43: DrFeelgood43 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 12 months! 
[1:32:01] CygnusC: Madge but i LIKE THAT THING
[1:32:02] AceOfFlame: Classic coke S+ Madge HOW DARE YOU
[1:32:03] vill4franca: they are just wanting to be mad about something
[1:32:04] sweatlordkush: zoloshnsky
[1:32:06] Eviltuna13: i love retail but hate classic rooBat rooRave
[1:32:07] Sabre_Wulf: he doesnt want all the time he spent in that version of WoW to not mean anything, which it doesnt
[1:32:07] HeIlraiser_: does the new stuff have to be recycled retail stuff
[1:32:08] JoeBangles_: 35 days sober from weed, I will be a lazy fatty no longer
[1:32:10] ear_shot: its stockholm syndrome to corporate monopolys
[1:32:10] itsXekko: they want the version of wow they play to be the most popular
[1:32:12] NotTheWheel: BatChest I love Dragonflight wdym
[1:32:13] calamitygg: that's a pretty terrible comparison, coke isn't a hobby that you engage with on a social level.
[1:32:16] Bytefish: ahh yes i'm watching a aguy watching a dude reviewing a dude whos talking about wow you hgotta love to see this LUL
[1:32:17] Trodenskjold: Man Staysafetv is pissing me off, talking shit about Coke like that
[1:32:23] nightshiv: retail is a boring esport game
[1:32:32] siilver40: Retail was fun until pandaria, then my interest went down hill, Tbc, WotLK and cata was fun
[1:32:33] muffinh1: from someone who tryed wow theres just too much shit to get n people dont really help others who dont really know how to play thats my experience of wow
[1:32:34] Ruinx81: Coke wtf, generic Cola is bis
[1:32:34] Zolshy89: I mean they are not going to reset game, thats why they announced 3 more expacs over next few years
[1:33:14] Ropy123: wow, that guy got deleted, what did he said? :D
[1:33:16] sweatlordkush: can we just get rid of the furry/weeb stuff in retail
[1:33:18] Mahca_: they did say that those next 3 expacs will be a close to the story tho, so well see what happens
[1:33:30] NotTheWheel: I don't understand the hero specs... or how they are different than the specs we already have. Like... If you're a Fury Warrior clearly you're gonna take the Mountain thane spec...
[1:33:37] CrixVibez: TBH I think you'd love how Warlock plays in DF. It's WILD> With they had it in classic
[1:33:37] HeIlraiser_: yeah balance is terrible
[1:33:52] NotTheWheel: plus it's just gonna be forgotten like every other expansion exclusive system
[1:33:54] yarzzy: pepoG bloat
[1:33:59] Slaanesh74: to be fair. it wouldn't take 15 years of min/maxing to "solve" a new iteration of WoW
[1:34:06] goodgameYUMMY: I would love if wow banned addons
[1:34:16] Ropy123: @Mahca_ I hear that almost every expansion in the last 10 years, "close to story" while they recon what they dont like
[1:34:17] Geoxsan: I think people are insanely min max in classic
[1:34:18] SupreemLeeder11: wtf why did you speed up the talking?
[1:34:20] sweatlordkush: i will play retail if they get rid of the chubby pandas, talking foxes and creepy furry dragons
[1:34:25] Zolshy89: @StaysafeTV also not trying to say your hating, just all the hate content in general
[1:34:26] NotTheWheel: Hero specs just remind me of the artifact weapons made you a "hero"
[1:34:26] goodgameYUMMY: LOL
[1:34:29] hxzcc: holy fuck i would love that
[1:34:30] MajesticAFx: ehhh
[1:34:33] AceOfFlame: its a shitty  take
[1:34:40] HeIlraiser_: THAT would be so good
[1:34:42] siilver40: Addons should still be availible but no weakauras, weakauras today play the game for you
[1:34:43] arcantio123: its designed for min maxing
[1:34:45] CrixVibez: YOu pretty much need WA's to raid top
[1:34:47] CrixVibez: lol
[1:34:49] Mahca_: @Ropy123 thats fair. guess im just hoping they close it with how far its gotten lol
[1:34:50] NotTheWheel: yes
[1:35:03] AceOfFlame: Max makes a good point of why addons are good and why it would be stupid for blizzard to just "add" the addons as base
[1:35:05] goodgameYUMMY: yeah but let people learn the actual game instead of making it easier by allowing addons.
[1:35:13] galthorne: is asmon fast forwarding in this vid or is he just speaking like he’s on something now? haven’t watched him in awhile
[1:35:18] Bronloch: ADDONS are only in the game because Blizz decided to use LUA code to make the UI customizable and interactable
[1:35:27] CrixVibez: @galthorne SS sped it up
[1:35:42] HeIlraiser_: People are doing entire pvp rotations with 1 key lol
[1:35:49] Ropy123: @Mahca_ I would not be surprised if they bring parallel universe when they run out of ideas LUL
[1:35:49] kaiju_kin: maybe poe
[1:35:55] Maxifrog: ESO to some extent
[1:35:56] OptimusBanana420: did you update you fojji pack?!
[1:36:04] galthorne: @crixvibez xoxo
[1:36:11] Lava_in_a_Lamp: @OptimusBanana420 LUL
[1:36:14] Mahca_: @Ropy123 theyve done so much that honestly anything is possible at this point LUL
[1:36:16] CrixVibez: true
[1:36:20] CrixVibez: I hate dps meters.
[1:36:25] Ruinx81: Game was designed for addons I guess, macros etc
[1:36:29] goodgameYUMMY: Have you ever seen the video "why its rude to suck at world of warcraft" ??
[1:36:31] Bronloch: TRUE
[1:36:34] basone: there would be idk i like the customization of the game
[1:36:37] basone: with addons
[1:36:41] TheEndIsNear777: my perfect mmo would have 5-7 years of content in 1st expansion even if you play 16 hours a day :)
[1:36:41] Trodenskjold: Id keep dmg meters
[1:36:49] Zolshy89: thats part of what makes WoW good
[1:36:50] TheEndIsNear777: so that means casuals would take decades LOL jk
[1:36:51] hxzcc: @Trodenskjold same but thats preaty much it
[1:36:52] sillynix: No I don't believe the devs to make a UI i like
[1:36:53] FryeTV: Cosmetic addons too or you just mean addons that are helping you play a class like class specific weak auras?
[1:37:19] Zolshy89: it may not be good for the ceiling, but addons oberall make the game better
[1:37:35] CrixVibez: @Zolshy89 they make it playable IMO
[1:37:38] Slaanesh74: you couldn't even see how much health mobs had
[1:37:40] Ropy123: LUL
[1:37:41] arcantio123: wait i didn't know they didn't have a combat log
[1:37:43] NotTheWheel: D:
[1:37:44] CrixVibez: I can't imagine playing withotu them
[1:37:46] HeIlraiser_: threat meter is hax lol
[1:37:46] Xephyr282: BASEDCIGAR
[1:37:48] goodgameYUMMY: What would exist in place of threat?
[1:37:58] Wildstar_Player: why dont you like theat? i have the opposite opinion
[1:38:00] Trodenskjold: @goodgameYUMMY Love
[1:38:04] yarzzy: parsing pepeP
[1:38:05] sweatlordkush: @goodgameYUMMY nothing, you dont need threat
[1:38:13] IR_ish: addons should be in the game, i don't trust blizzard to dev anything
[1:38:13] Bronloch: THREAT is the fundamental mechanic that makes The Holy Trinity work at a basic level
[1:38:14] goodgameYUMMY: @Trodenskjold <3
[1:38:16] NotTheWheel: D: say it isn't so
[1:38:19] biki2112: not realy
[1:38:25] r0xorzb0xorz: YEP tanks focus on damage mitigation in retail vs threat
[1:38:28] hxzcc: true
[1:38:29] basone: @StaysafeTV retail threat rn is dogshit its super impactful in mplus
[1:38:33] NotTheWheel: but my skill to keep threat!!!one!
[1:38:39] IR_ish: they even strongarm you to give you their mobilephone number for 4 bag slots
[1:38:40] zenity360: I like retail tank mechanics. Its more about how well you can mitigate damage
[1:38:40] Ruinx81: Very hard to lose threat yeah
[1:38:41] Trodenskjold: @basone And everyone hates it
[1:38:45] basone: @Trodenskjold 1000%
[1:38:47] CrixVibez: There is actually ZERO threat issues in Retail
[1:38:47] AceOfFlame: they removed skittish becuase dps basically got threat alot and slowed gameplay down and people hated it and they removed it
[1:38:56] IR_ish: your privacy is worth 4 bag slots Kappa
[1:38:59] Lava_in_a_Lamp: Threat is bad in classic imo
[1:39:01] kaiju_kin: fun no it is bad
[1:39:05] basone: @CrixVibez in mplus there is i rip threat all the time in high keys 20 sconds into pulls sometimes
[1:39:10] basone: its a common issue
[1:39:11] lerler: as a tank in WOTLK, it makes the game boring AF
[1:39:15] r0xorzb0xorz: damage mit
[1:39:26] Ruinx81: It definitely sucks more now that they buffed all class aoe and then come out and say they don’t want tanks holding aoe threat too easily
[1:39:27] glaudius: "these gloves cause you to do 0.3435% more threat for the next 4 seconds 4 min cd" wow man my dick can only get this limp.... very cool system.
[1:39:38] CrixVibez: @CrixVibez I do high keys and never pull. Unless I open while the tank is gathering, but that's DPS fault iMO, not tank
[1:39:40] Zolshy89: in classic you just press sunder Lol
[1:39:56] kevo_k: I enjoy both tbh
[1:40:06] Ingame: I enjoy both
[1:40:06] sweatlordkush: there is no real reason to have threat in the game
[1:40:07] lerler: retail tanking is fun, but WOTLK tanking is boring AF, i think the difference is in WOTLK tanking is easy in every sense, no surv at all
[1:40:21] FryeTV: I enjoy both a lot for different reasons
[1:40:24] t0rstin: 40 zones vs 5 zones
[1:40:28] basone: @CrixVibez they nerfed tank threat at the start of xpac melee specs notoriously have been pulling threat all expac
[1:40:29] CrixVibez: Like on my lock, if I implode off rip, then yeah i'll pull ofc, but shouldn't do that. @basone
[1:40:38] Bronloch: BUT then you get the M+ thing where tank tags mobs and then keeps running while dps trail behind killing mobs from 3mins ago! LUL
[1:40:53] Punchatron5000: same
[1:40:57] Ropy123: @lerler what make it worse, not all tanks can hold agroo equaly, they could just buff treath generating for tanks and lower a bit for DPS, instead of "removing" it
[1:41:04] sweatlordkush: if you taunt something there should be no way for dps to rip off threat. its just monotonous
[1:41:10] Zolshy89: thats why they have 2 versions of wow
[1:41:13] Xephyr282: understandable
[1:41:15] Zolshy89: KEKG
[1:41:20] Ingame: True
[1:41:20] t0rstin: Same
[1:41:22] Ingame: I agree
[1:41:23] HeIlraiser_: yeah
[1:41:31] Punchatron5000: are there more classic players than retail?
[1:41:37] goodgameYUMMY: Season of Discovery TBC has bosses in every zone that players fight for
[1:41:40] crumbler81: just call it Dungeons of Warcraft
[1:41:43] sweatlordkush: thats basically retail
[1:41:44] Ropy123: true
[1:41:45] AceOfFlame: i mean that was also 2019 classic wow to
[1:41:45] Slaanesh74: Retail is a lobby game
[1:41:48] Ingame: If there is no word, the game is a lobby game
[1:41:49] basone: @CrixVibez 20 seconds into the pull people will pull threat just an issue with some melee specs
[1:41:51] sweatlordkush: wotlk and retail = lobby games
[1:41:54] lerler: TBC was fun AF
[1:41:58] NotTheWheel: TBC and Wrath were raid loggy for sure
[1:41:59] cafrozed: but TC overall is not as good as classic
[1:42:02] seymourmoney: bro I want arena in SoD
[1:42:05] novvum: They should of started with RBG than Arenas
[1:42:05] efefeh: tbc best expansion
[1:42:10] 4ddic7: sstvKING
[1:42:12] CrixVibez: @CrixVibez Ahh I see.
[1:42:17] Lava_in_a_Lamp: TBC has a good world but it is seperate from azeroth
[1:42:36] CrixVibez: I feel liek our melee never pull, but I ugess could be different per group
[1:42:37] cafrozed: this game was released 20 years ago.....and yet we still have not even a single game that's ever come close
[1:42:41] cafrozed: it's so sad
[1:42:44] 3lfidan: He isn't wrong
[1:42:50] novvum: Warcraft logs ruined WoW imo
[1:42:50] AceOfFlame: is he talking about retail? Because people in classic play for parses more then retail does...
[1:42:51] rains_wl: That was asmons worst take
[1:42:55] Ruinx81: SoD parse culture is actually pretty toxic
[1:42:56] Spanos_: after its on farm parsing is what's left
[1:42:59] Ropy123: @novvum agree
[1:43:08] sweatlordkush: this is why we need GDKPs Kappa
[1:43:15] basone: @CrixVibez only monk fdk ret pal usually do sometimes fire mage this is only in 26-28s ive experience this though maybe bad tanks
[1:43:30] Zolshy89: Logs are just a tool
[1:43:30] goodgameYUMMY: good example of that is Lady Saravass, everyone decided the meta is to just DPS her down instead of deal with the addons
[1:43:32] Slaanesh74: I don't think most people care about class skins
[1:43:41] jbroni: Warcraft logs honestly just exposed really bad players and made people realize the game was way harder while playing with those players. community issue more than log issue
[1:43:55] Zolshy89: I mean is it also because of Meta gaming, ppl just game differently now than they did even 5 years ago
[1:43:56] CrixVibez: @CrixVibez YEah might be bad tanks, I'm not sure. I don't run with FDK often, but our ret seems fine on trheat. But also running VDH or Prot pall, so they just have good threat
[1:44:03] kaiju_kin: its really not bad
[1:44:04] arcantio123: it is KEKW
[1:44:04] rains_wl: watch good guild, they dont care about damage in general, they make classes hold cd's for certain reasons so terrible parse but they kill bosses, bad asmon take
[1:44:05] sigilfish: dragussies arent thicc enough
[1:44:07] AceOfFlame: the gameplay DF is very good, bu the story is haHAA
[1:44:10] sweatlordkush: its not bad, just boring
[1:44:11] Ingame: it's not bad
[1:44:12] hxzcc: gameplay is good, everything else is ass
[1:44:12] Sunderwire_: it’s fun
[1:44:15] 3lfidan: story is cool zones are cool leveling pvp on was cool end game sucks
[1:44:19] Punchatron5000: first 3 weeks were good
[1:44:19] Bronloch: NO DRAGON TANKS
[1:44:19] HeIlraiser_: history
[1:44:21] sigilfish: no world
[1:44:21] sweatlordkush: too formulaic
[1:44:21] Trodenskjold: Its decent. Not good nor bad
[1:44:21] Ropy123: @jbroni warcraft logs is just bullshit, it punish you for doing mechanics, I stop trusting them years ago
[1:44:22] Jay_rb: Shadowlands was the problem with Dragonflight
[1:44:22] markja629: the story is trash
[1:44:24] summerteeth: it's bloated
[1:44:25] Ruinx81: It’s great but Shadowlands soured everyone
[1:44:26] iBanEvader: biggest problems in retail are the boring grinds @StaysafeTV
[1:44:26] r0xorzb0xorz: the story makes me want to rip my eyes out
[1:44:27] 3lfidan: it's the same problem we had in shadowlands
[1:44:28] basone: previous expacs df is really fucking good made me quit wrath
[1:44:28] iBanEvader: world quests
[1:44:31] iBanEvader: bad systems
[1:44:32] TacoN64: I think the story and how much more they could have done
[1:44:33] HeIlraiser_: people dont forget when they waste money
[1:44:34] gotcha2157: i think dragonflight  pvp is decent rn
[1:44:34] t0rstin: I hate the dragonflight world
[1:44:35] 4ddic7: Graphics and no sense of world
[1:44:35] iBanEvader: warfronts, expeditions
[1:44:36] laazey: everything is pretty decent but the story is trash
[1:44:39] yarzzy: Sweaty ADHD gameplay, gay story
[1:44:39] sweatlordkush: formulaic, lobby game, no real world, no guilds because ppl rely on mythic+
[1:44:39] Nytsongx: dragonflight was good in the first patch when i was palying it.. solo shuffle had issues and taht sucked but it was fun
[1:44:39] sigilfish: need more world activities monkaHmm
[1:44:42] orasay1996: story sucks and its not really a mmo feel to it anymore
[1:44:44] jbroni: for 99 parses maybe. but most people are not going for 99
[1:44:46] 4ddic7: Optics
[1:44:47] CrixVibez: You literally dont have to do anytihng in the open world
[1:44:49] Bronloch: NO DRAGON TANKS IS DUMB
[1:44:52] CrixVibez: and there is no systems
[1:44:54] iBanEvader: the dragon race looks cringe
[1:44:55] lizcat_: i don’t like the blatant pandering to women either
[1:44:55] Slaanesh74: it's good, but there's no community
[1:44:56] VegaCP: Scaly
[1:44:57] r0xorzb0xorz: ThatsGoingInMyBasedCompilation
[1:44:57] orasay1996: gameplay stuff and pve is actually the best its been in a long time
[1:44:58] yarzzy: TRUE
[1:45:00] AntarcticTreaty: aesthetically looks like Lgbt rainbow vomit. so done with it globikFreakout
[1:45:01] iBanEvader: true
[1:45:01] Zolshy89: HUH
[1:45:02] macfisker: they played it safe instead of going crazy with it
[1:45:03] arcantio123: OMEGALUL
[1:45:04] iBanEvader: WoW is supposed to be dark
[1:45:04] sirdreadeye: Wok

[1:45:06] ahtee9: DICKS
[1:45:07] Ingame: yep
[1:45:08] Jay_rb: OMEGALUL
[1:45:09] markja629: the ‘girl boss’ theme is off putting
[1:45:10] sweatlordkush: mythic+ killed guilds and community in a huge way
[1:45:12] kaiju_kin: true, the cinematics didnt do any favors
[1:45:14] Locks1088: 35 here
[1:45:14] bretmanbruh: DICKS
[1:45:14] obstata: it had a pro-life message in the storyline i noticed... where they saved the eggs
[1:45:15] Slaanesh74: everyone just queues up to do content
[1:45:18] zenity360: 30 year old conservative dudes
[1:45:18] basone: @CrixVibez only superblooms for 9 hours to get legendary LMFAO it sucked
[1:45:23] hxzcc: dragonflight story is gay af

[1:45:59] yarzzy: I wasn't aggresive until I have been treaded on Madge
[1:46:02] Slaanesh74: dragonflight is a girl-boss influence on the game
[1:46:03] Bronloch: DRAGthyr human form literally wears pride makeup! LUL

[1:46:56] novvum: They did it in OW
[1:47:03] xyth_alispera: no theirs just a bunch of perverts who can’t keep their emotions in check running retail
[1:47:03] dwamatic: people hate being manipulated
[1:47:12] jay_deetv: I don’t really think that was it, but it could be.
[1:47:14] Bronloch: SEVERAL times in DF you will look up from your questing and see yourself surrounded by 3-5 girlboss dragons and its so forced and obvious is lame! LUL
[1:47:14] desweck: body type stuff is ridiculous and is an open sore to what politics blizzard supports

[1:47:39] sweatlordkush: the worst thing about retail is the visuals. the swords in retail look like they're filled with hot air
[1:47:41] Slaanesh74: hot take: I think WoW is successful because of addons.
[1:47:48] HeIlraiser_: if paladins can be tanks why cant warriors be a healer lol
[1:47:52] soupxhot: we need more bowls of fruit in WoW

[2:30:43] jahikoi: Phase 3 and 4 of thermaplugg is too easy
[2:30:45] tsetse2fly: @StaysafeTV I just did a casual 1h20m Gnomer
[2:30:46] r3dman3294: just tuned in you already cleared on lock? you get anything? @staysafetv
[2:30:55] wavecadet: free mount tho
[2:30:57] jahikoi: Phase 2 of thermaplugg being so much harder than 3 or 4 is anticlimactic
[2:30:59] wavecadet: save 100g
[2:31:01] dirbagdan: I work full time and have a life outside of wow, 1 character is more than enough for me to keep up with tbh
[2:31:08] Gabe4D: I wish healers got more coins
[2:31:08] BadGerbilLion: Event -> Silver -> Logs -> Arathi rep -> BiS
[2:31:09] KaiserTex: they should just periodically add more rewards during the phase IMO
[2:31:14] straff_dis: no
[2:31:16] einself111: no
[2:31:18] Gabe4D: it feels like i just had to get sw death and kill steal
[2:31:21] Azsune: exalted AB rep from it is great tho
[2:31:22] einself111: event is total garbage
[2:31:24] tsetse2fly: @StaysafeTV but you don't care for honor, Arathi or mount on your boomkin?
[2:31:25] HrdScp: your groups are way above average
[2:31:30] lordextraordinary: 14
[2:31:34] HeIlraiser_: still dont have a mount lol
[2:31:36] wavecadet: nah you can just ghost walk
[2:31:36] sargent_baddy: I got 1800 coins last night in one event
[2:31:37] warn1ng: alot im inthat situation now
[2:31:37] lordextraordinary: druid got speed
[2:31:37] wavecadet: cuz its 100%
[2:31:40] straff_dis: its not about the mount so much, its mostly about using silver for ab rep which takes hundreds of silver
[2:31:43] ghostbagster: Dont say it they gonna nerf it kek
[2:31:44] straff_dis: good reason to farm it
[2:31:46] Pudgypantss: didn;t most of them just graveyard camp the first couple days
[2:31:53] naughtiemares: Yeah
[2:31:57] naughtiemares: They fixed it though
[2:32:04] wavecadet: the god is def OP
[2:32:05] einself111: nope
[2:32:05] Azsune: mount doesnt really matter with changes and u go faster while dead than mounted
[2:32:07] HeIlraiser_: will take me a week to farm gold for a mount
[2:32:07] dirbagdan: True
[2:32:10] straff_dis: cringe
[2:32:15] mikey9988: wrong
[2:32:20] pyro_lurkz: hard disagree
[2:32:23] KaiserTex: no
[2:32:24] latenightsuckmeright: mad cringe
[2:32:26] varamithis: 150%
[2:32:26] Plokoon100: they need to give melee a flat spell resist as well
[2:32:27] Gabe4D: it should cost 2G
[2:32:27] tjee: nah
[2:32:28] iBanEvader: it's too late to change it now
[2:32:28] nickylas: problem is i wouldnt be able to have a single alt then
[2:32:30] revora_: True
[2:32:31] person1029492: the engi gear is plenty expensive, 150 to 200g
[2:32:37] person1029492: crafting gear*
[2:32:39] BadGerbilLion: Everyone would feel like they have to farm it
[2:32:42] naughtiemares: 75 movespeed
[2:32:43] jiggeritus: facts
[2:32:45] tsetse2fly: guys he's making incentives for people to go to STV
[2:32:47] iBanEvader: @StaysafeTV it's too late to change it now I think
[2:32:51] jiggeritus: cosmetics are gay
[2:32:51] naughtiemares: 65 isn't enough
[2:32:52] KungKotz: and the mount will be fucking shit p4
[2:32:54] iBanEvader: @StaysafeTV maybe they can add a new mount with faster speed
[2:32:56] ScarfaceCEO: Cursed odd number
[2:33:01] iBanEvader: that is expensive
[2:33:01] arcane_p: Your so right
[2:33:01] CYBERDEMON6669: the mount skins aren't interesting to me so I dont really care
[2:33:07] lolika91: what happens with chars when sod season is over?
[2:33:12] Brenno_Mc: that's a pretty big carrot
[2:33:25] patronuschum: whats ur 2nd favourite class in wow
[2:33:35] Sourr09: 20 total
[2:33:39] Thefoog777: 20
[2:33:46] einself111: they don't want the event to be mandatory i think it is good they don't make it super hard to get the items for pve
[2:33:48] Brenno_Mc: 20 total
[2:33:48] ScarletPaladin: @lolika91 undetermined, but confirmed not merging with era, maybe having their own standalone permanent servers
[2:33:55] revora_: @lolika91 it may not 'end' it'll exist moving forward. Maybe people won't play but yeah
[2:33:55] mikey9988: you need them to craft the filament
[2:34:04] ghostbagster: That why i watch u,  even i don't agree its pretty reasonable
[2:34:23] HeIlraiser_: is a mount still 40g have not played since classic
[2:34:38] dirbagdan: It's because you're a streamer and play more than anyone else.
[2:34:42] KaiserTex: I think they should periodically add new rewards to STV event throughout the phase to keep it fresh
[2:34:45] ScarletPaladin: I got everything I wanted from the even after the 2nd time I did it, I'm only farming for rep now
[2:34:46] dirbagdan: Not everyone is expereiencing what you are
[2:34:52] mikey9988: yeah there needs to be a better compromise with the phase length
[2:34:58] craboskai: fucking casual dad playing 1hour per week KEKL
[2:35:03] spenstig_: why dont you buy all the mats you need for the head in one go? you need gniodine and leather aswell
[2:35:03] HeIlraiser_: me
[2:35:06] ghostbagster: xdd
[2:35:08] tsetse2fly: FFSDFSD monkaW
[2:35:12] person1029492: @HeIlraiser_ 100g, 10% off with rank 3, 10% off with honored SW/IF/Darn/Gnomes
[2:35:14] straff_dis: I have more bis than you but i dont wanna grind that much, rather farm gold and work on alts
[2:35:17] m2bmw: @craboskai my wife only lets me play 30 mins per day
[2:35:19] CygnusC: not me, i like alts
[2:35:22] jiggeritus: facts, im alrdy bored of Phase 2
[2:35:23] Gabe4D: FFSDFSD
[2:35:29] dirbagdan: True, but we arent playing as many alts with fulltime jobs and stuff im thinking
[2:35:30] Pudgypantss: im already dreading an alt
[2:35:33] nashonatorrr: 1-25 is fine now
[2:35:34] cyonara74: i have 3 lvl 40s
[2:35:34] tsetse2fly: FFSDFSD  monkaW
[2:35:35] daqqs: i enjoy it :)
[2:35:36] Leviosor: dobbbbbbbbby
[2:35:37] cryfest07: I don't even want to do it once
[2:35:38] r0xorzb0xorz: 25-40 sucked
[2:35:39] Pudgypantss: they need to make 1-40 50% exp buff
[2:35:39] HeIlraiser_: @person1029492 wtf that will take me 2 weeks
[2:35:41] latenightsuckmeright: @m2bmw dudes strait whipped
[2:35:42] orangemaple24: thats fine tho! Its alrdy going to be almost 5 weeks in 2 weeks from now
[2:35:46] desweck: no
[2:35:46] Enigmaticworld: Im BFD raid logging 3 characters, gonna take me to april to get 40
[2:35:47] Robbtuck: DICKS
[2:35:50] jorvelitso: nahh
[2:35:51] revora_: Prob just 1 alt for me.  Leveling slowly in BFD
[2:35:52] iMattbat: I must be weird I like 25-40 lol
[2:35:53] einself111: the event is a total garbage lagfest, they can't force people to do this shit for weeks
[2:35:55] Mawshaw: I think just nerfing blood is fine, but don't need to double down with blood nerf + AB lumber nerf
[2:35:57] Still_Clean: keep the xp buff til 40 Madge
[2:36:00] desweck: nope
[2:36:00] ghostbagster: I like to level :(
[2:36:00] Gabe4D: 25-40 was super fast just spamming Stocks, then RFK, then SM
[2:36:02] Robbtuck: LOL
[2:36:02] Leviosor: dicks
[2:36:07] Gabe4D: took me 6 days to level 1-40
[2:36:09] tsetse2fly: @StaysafeTV didn't you say 1 day BFD?
[2:36:09] r0xorzb0xorz: buff the sleeping bag hard
[2:36:11] Leviosor: F
[2:36:14] person1029492: @HeIlraiser_ made about 32g in 1.5 hrs, can also get lucky with prebis dropping
[2:36:17] latenightsuckmeright: ive done gnomer 3 times and have gotten 1 item
[2:36:19] straff_dis: thats what bfd is for? thankfully its back on the 3day lockout
[2:36:20] patronuschum: is druid ur 2nd fave class?
[2:36:22] therattmoth: tired of leveling in SM, tired of doing the same quests...it takes so long to level and Im poor all the time
[2:36:25] biki2112: how do you get your gold? i spend 80% of my time playing farming gold
[2:36:34] einself111: buff sleeping bag
[2:36:35] biki2112: its content
[2:36:37] tsetse2fly: You likee that BFD 1 day lockout I think
[2:36:40] HeIlraiser_: @person1029492 I just quest I dont do dungeons
[2:36:46] daqqs: 3d bfd is fine
[2:36:49] straff_dis: okay I agree with that
[2:36:51] dirbagdan: @StaysafeTV I'm not disagreeing wholeheartedly, I'm just thinking that the fear of running out of content isn't something the average person will see.
[2:36:56] Omgwtfipwndu: bfd exp up to 40
[2:36:56] dontbecold: Some of BFD is pre bis still Pog
[2:36:56] einself111: and make it account wide
[2:36:58] r0xorzb0xorz: YEP
[2:37:00] straff_dis: i would do 15%
[2:37:02] mrwasdead: make it so that every quest gives a billion xp YEP
[2:37:02] straff_dis: s
[2:37:04] tsetse2fly: 10% Pog
[2:37:08] rbo2992: 3% is a gimmick lol
[2:37:10] WiseguyGG: ya 5% per stack
[2:37:11] MrSchneetzel: 10% fs
[2:37:13] straff_dis: 5% a min which is nice
[2:37:17] daqqs: 15 Pog
[2:37:20] wavecadet: craft student fodder
[2:37:24] wavecadet: thru fishing and cooking
[2:37:25] Sourr09: i do need to get my fihsing and cooking
[2:37:25] wavecadet: def
[2:37:26] Enigmaticworld: 15% is a good idea,
[2:37:27] pyro_lurkz: buff quest xp by 100% NOT dungeons
[2:37:29] CygnusC: more exp from boxes
[2:37:31] straff_dis: make hot cocoa lol a rested xp food
[2:37:31] Sourr09: one thing i havent touched yet
[2:37:34] dirbagdan: yes do something with cooking and fishing
[2:37:46] dirbagdan: AYAYA
[2:37:47] tsetse2fly: AYAYA ?
[2:37:48] ScarletPaladin: AYAYA
[2:37:49] Ropy123: AYAYA
[2:37:52] iMattbat: AYAYA
[2:37:54] WiseguyGG: having to lay in a bag for 3 min for 3% is seriously cheesy let’s be real lol
[2:38:13] ScarletPaladin: we used to be able to turn in unfilled boxes, why did they take that away in the first place
[2:38:17] HeIlraiser_: I delted 20 boxes wtf
[2:38:19] daqqs: but make them rarer from open world
[2:38:19] craboskai: AYAYA
[2:38:22] revora_: LUL
[2:38:23] wavecadet: you said "oh yea yea yea yea":
[2:38:25] sweatlordkush: BatChest
[2:38:25] einself111: youa re the weeb KEKW
[2:38:26] KingQueenAce: AYAYA
[2:38:26] bone555: AYAYA
[2:38:27] wavecadet: AYAYAYAAY
[2:38:28] crumbler81: weeb raid Pog
[2:38:30] WillowJane: AYAYA
[2:38:31] Ropy123: LUL
[2:38:33] Gabe4D: LOL
[2:38:33] mikyki: no you said ayaya and twitch chat is autistic
[2:38:34] Sourr09: KEKW
[2:38:37] HeIlraiser_: mee
[2:38:41] bone555: This is a weeb community
[2:38:46] Ropy123: @mikyki KEKW
[2:38:46] tsetse2fly: ayaya
[2:38:50] Leviosor: based
[2:38:54] dirbagdan: the boxes have become a meme
[2:39:00] sicknope: The waylaid boxes really give so low xp for the requirements needed :p they failed hard with that
[2:39:00] bmnjnjk: The boxes are stupid expensive to fill right now
[2:39:02] chadmuska: nice beard
[2:39:03] rbo2992: the rune system is a huge burden to leveling alts
[2:39:05] crumbler81: @StaysafeTV new Persona stream when?!
[2:39:06] Gabe4D: many ppl didnt even bother with phase 2
[2:39:08] chadmuska: xarDing
[2:39:13] WiseguyGG: coming ? it’s already started
[2:39:13] Leviosor: @rbo2992 yup hassle
[2:39:17] iMattbat: Half the time people aren't even selling what the boxes require lol
[2:39:20] desweck: w
[2:39:23] Pancho_Man: people  already dropping
[2:39:25] dft_kekwplays: @StaysafeTV i think soon the will find a way to boost... then that will be the meta to level again like always...
[2:39:36] MrSchneetzel: sounds like wow tbh, new patch of phase play for two weeks and then thats it
[2:39:37] djb1021993: i played phase 1 and i intended to play phase 2 but have not logged in yet
[2:39:38] Fullbeast420: no one bag IDSGUTING
[2:39:39] Gabe4D: They didnt intend for each phase to have lots of long term participation
[2:39:42] MrSchneetzel: or*
[2:39:42] tsetse2fly: @rbo2992 Elaborate
[2:39:48] Gabe4D: they're sprinkling in other releases inbetween
[2:39:53] Gabe4D: SSF HC in a week
[2:39:53] straff_dis: key word 2 to 3 weeks
[2:39:57] straff_dis: when phase 2 is almost over
[2:39:57] dft_kekwplays: @StaysafeTV i think soon the will find a way to boost. from mage's .. then that will be the meta to level again like always...
[2:40:00] dirbagdan: @rbo2992 the thing is now you can just outlevel the mob to get the rune and get it later. which does suck when you could have them to help level faster
[2:40:03] ardice1: 100% agreed with you
[2:40:06] Gabe4D: Cata Classic pre patch, then cata classic launch after phase 3
[2:40:06] jiggeritus: 25-40 was boring af
[2:40:09] rbo2992: @tsetse2fly  its a lot of work to collect all the runes
[2:40:10] thepinga: im purposely leveling slow to 40 because i don't want to get bored too fast in p2 like i did p1
[2:40:17] ardice1: for the first time in awhile
[2:40:19] revora_: @straff_dis phase 2 probably another 2-3 months
[2:40:21] desweck: 25-40 will be easier and not so lame once you can level in the world and not spam dung
[2:40:23] KaiserTex: wonder how 40-50 will be
[2:40:25] Fullbeast420: lol takes like lit 2 days
[2:40:28] ardice1: dog shit
[2:40:32] lordextraordinary: first always fun. second Worst ever
[2:40:32] HeIlraiser_: yeah nobody in the world and everybody leveling in dingeons yeah mmo lol
[2:40:34] dirbagdan: I think we all just stayed in SM for 2 days lol
[2:40:35] mrwasdead: my coworker can grind arathi rep to exalt like wsg last phase YEP
[2:40:36] dft_kekwplays: @StaysafeTV soon the will find a way to boost. from mage's .. then that will be the meta to level again like always...
[2:40:39] arcane_p: I just wish they made ground mounts go Way faster like the lvl 40 is 100% and the lvl 60 is 200%
[2:40:39] Fullbeast420: lol you can alos quest lol?
[2:40:41] ardice1: they did say they wanted to do something about the dungeon grinds
[2:40:41] robbiestacks: im having a ton of fun solo questing lol
[2:40:43] mildmang0: quested the whole way 25 to 40 was a vibe
[2:40:48] mikey9988: will the 40-50 meta be any different
[2:40:50] iMattbat: As a new ish wow player the dungeon grinding has been helping me learn classes tbh
[2:40:54] bmnjnjk: Dungeon grinding once at launch was fun sure but doing that on another character? HELL NO
[2:40:57] markja629: should they boost quest xp in p3 to help with that? like SoM
[2:41:00] nashonatorrr: just start one of everytthing and see what happens
[2:41:05] tsetse2fly: @rbo2992 Is that a bad thing? Imo shouldn't be that easy to get. All the Phase 2 runes wasn't hard to get
[2:41:10] robbiestacks: I also solo quested and had a friend that dunegon spammed and i destroyed him
[2:41:37] jazzyjoff: It's to grindy
[2:41:42] CYBERDEMON6669: 1 character is enough for me
[2:41:49] dft_kekwplays: @StaysafeTV soon the will find a way to boost. from mage's .. then that will be the meta to level again like always...
[2:41:49] HeIlraiser_: grind is the best part of a game for me
[2:41:51] ScarletPaladin: all my friends quit before they even hit 40 on their main
[2:41:53] KaiserTex: @StaysafeTV 50% bonus exp buff goes all the way to 40 after your first 40? Thoughts
[2:41:55] Pancho_Man: true, ive got a job and no life. but other people I play with are like 32 rn
[2:42:01] dontbecold: Sadge Its cause they banned GDKPs
[2:42:04] goodgameYUMMY: I think the casual average player is a myth. I think world of warcraft is binary, you're either a no life or a viewer.
[2:42:06] wavecadet: i mean its the truth
[2:42:08] BadGerbilLion: BFD xp for alts has been super good, and on top of rested it's fine
[2:42:09] mrwasdead: jim from the office will be 40 in a week or two and then give up after a bad gnomer run
[2:42:10] Gabe4D: Im working on char 2
[2:42:12] bmnjnjk: Unless you level like 6 characters the game has almost ZERO content in SoD
[2:42:13] wavecadet: SoD is just alt central
[2:42:37] rbo2992: @tsetse2fly right but in regards to leveling alts, the rune grinds are a prohibitive to me wanting to level them
[2:42:39] Fullbeast420: lol i mean most "casual" players prolly only leveling one char to 40 anyway IMO
[2:42:42] TurboBased: pepeLaugh your gold/silver amount
[2:42:43] MrSchneetzel: wait, wheres ur gold ss?
[2:42:43] KaiserTex: it's worth it, that helm is better than T1 LUL
[2:42:46] tenwick: the helms were like 200g yesterday to craft
[2:42:48] dirbagdan: @tsetse2fly yes, im glad they made the runes more manageable. p1 runes were so stupid having to fight mobs 7 levels higher than you to get items in a 40 man raid meanwhile they only made "THE RAID" 10 man. LUL
[2:42:57] jazzyjoff: @HeIlraiser_ I love it to but also we profit of the casual andies - make the pace for them reachable and create some unique RP items for the real chads
[2:43:02] dft_kekwplays: @StaysafeTV soon the will find a way to boost. from mage's .. then that will be the meta to level again like always...
[2:43:09] MrSchneetzel: i got over 100 gold in quest in less than a day from low level wuest
[2:43:10] Gabe4D: @StaysafeTV Are priests slow farmers?
[2:43:13] markja629: I got 3 characters to 25 in P2 and pretty much just doing BFD every 3 days
[2:43:16] Brenno_Mc: you'll get 8g back from selling your grime ench
[2:43:18] KaiserTex: 50% exp buff goes all the way to 40 after your FIRST 40? what you think @StaysafeTV
[2:43:19] dft_kekwplays: g2g
[2:43:19] HeIlraiser_: Blasted lands :) its good to be back
[2:43:34] therattmoth: priest farming is slow AF
[2:43:46] dft_kekwplays: its always like that .. wont chance.
[2:43:57] wavecadet: holy fuck that sounds so fun
[2:43:58] sweatlordkush: YEP
[2:43:59] rbo2992: even more boring then just leveling
[2:44:00] wavecadet: xxd
[2:44:02] dft_kekwplays: i dont like it but it wont chance tho
[2:44:03] Deefah: While jacking off
[2:44:04] Leviosor: sounds awesome
[2:44:04] CYBERDEMON6669: 100%
[2:44:05] dontbecold: Sadge If we had GDKPs we wouldnt need to buy gold
[2:44:06] Gabe4D: While you give your gold you bought back to the company that sold it to yoU LOL
[2:44:07] HeIlraiser_: dats payo lol
[2:44:07] r0xorzb0xorz: YEP cause I can boost on my lock :)
[2:44:07] Sunderwire_: based
[2:44:15] Brenno_Mc: priest farming was fine - I just spammed SM
[2:44:18] SepeIio: MUGA
[2:44:18] mrwasdead: some streamers would think it's cool
[2:44:19] dirbagdan: I think boosting should be banned along with GDKP. I'm sorry it has to be this way, but people have taken advantage of things and it has to be set right.
[2:44:19] einself111: gz :)
[2:44:22] Pancho_Man: BG xp would be cool but people would just spam BGs like instance
[2:44:22] wavecadet: gz
[2:44:25] Fullbeast420: so play the game the way it was intented with dungeons and quersting?
[2:44:26] revora_: @dft_kekwplays chance or change? Stare
[2:44:28] tsetse2fly: R)
[2:44:28] CygnusC: R)
[2:44:29] Plokoon100: HOLY
[2:44:30] Reliek: supoer villan

[6:07:42] osopolar1977: yes
[6:07:48] longsfellow1200: you didnt unbooon, you griefed the raid
[6:07:48] bmnjnjk: They are just sitting there and letting the sheep hit them and not moving the boss LUL
[6:07:49] thatquidproquo: 5Head
[6:08:00] KKonaStevieG: oh staysafe you didn't unboon why come you don't unboon? Kappa
[6:08:00] bone555: Bro just heal
[6:08:02] bone555: KEKW
[6:08:02] peahness: have you done your sons of hodir dailies
[6:08:02] sanjisan69: The trick is just going again and again and practicing
[6:08:03] Bearcause: swifty just did it now with world buffs come on you dont need them LUL
[6:08:10] concernedviewer4: Yeah, im concerned.
[6:08:11] Trav_Where: i don't think prot is even the meta
[6:08:13] WhoHazCake: clearly a healer issue MiniK
[6:08:16] Bearcause: without workd buffs i mean
[6:08:16] HeIlraiser_: LUL
[6:08:16] Fuzzywuggums: rogue tan and a not-prot warrior
[6:08:22] grizz430: boomie bear tank time
[6:08:22] WhoHazCake: actually blamed heals OMEGALUL
[6:08:23] fuguelah: are they fucking up on purpose for content or just super undergeared?
[6:08:24] osopolar1977: Arms softie
[6:08:27] sanjisan69: 🚫 WORLD BUFFS 🚫
[6:08:29] Trav_Where: pain suppression?
[6:08:35] Its_big_t: its always the healers fault.... sigh
[6:08:43] bmnjnjk: You know what would help? A priest with actual healing runes
[6:08:44] AxelFromAustralia: im growing my beard out and my boss keeps trying to subtlety ask me to shave, every time she asks it’s staying for  another month
[6:08:44] steevwtf: warrior and shaman can int squirrel if rogue is tanking dragon
[6:08:50] windatar: If they're tanking Squirrel and chicken on one person thats ALOT of damage on one tank.
[6:08:53] steevwtf: the squirrels wrench hits for about 600
[6:08:59] NutterCircus: this is a first for sure.
[6:09:04] MajesticAFx: LUL
[6:09:05] NotTheWheel: KEKW
[6:09:09] tecncaldificltes: why is soni tanking if you have 2 tanks ?
[6:09:11] NotTheWheel: <- LUL
[6:09:12] WiseguyGG: so where is the weak link then ? what’s going wrong
[6:09:14] NotTheWheel: <3
[6:09:14] Arcsilin: very suprised u giga gamers are wiping
[6:09:20] bmnjnjk: Yeah im confused what they are even debating about... how can people that play this game this much suck this much
[6:09:21] osopolar1977: he couldn’t stop a nose bleed
[6:09:22] ohl315: we cleared week 1 and didn’t unboon because we 1 shot
[6:09:25] steevwtf: u dont have to kill the egg, just kite away from it
[6:09:27] vty_x: when you got solid healers/tank its easy
[6:09:27] fuguelah: fresh alts?
[6:09:27] QuestFor420: 10mans are grueling cancer \
[6:09:38] vty_x: a lot of dmg
[6:09:44] Trav_Where: my group struggled with it the first week, but the priest wasn't using PoM or shield
[6:09:55] NutterCircus: I feel like the more detail they add about the mobs the worse it gets.
[6:09:57] steevwtf: @QuestFor420 nah 10mans are way easier for identifying shit players LUL
[6:09:58] cook_pc: can we get a number crunch here
[6:10:03] snake_like: melee not running out for overheat. ranged hitting sheep reflect. squirrel not getting interrupted. people getting clipped by dragonbreath. sheep walking onto people. it's everything
[6:10:08] lickmypetals: menegarie is easier then electrocutioneer dont @ me
[6:10:10] osopolar1977: all that talking but took dragon breath
[6:10:18] windatar: Does Warlock have Meta rune? He could go Meta rune tank Chicken the rogue tanks squirrel and kicks the wrench and the shaman tanks dragon. Tank dragon away from the chicken and squirrel and should be golden.
[6:10:20] concernedviewer4: @cook_pc 3.33 repeating ofc
[6:10:37] sabanalol1: im stiff btw
[6:10:40] ryufromstreets6: aren't you just supposed to kite the sheep and not tank it at all lol
[6:10:44] TrooperHuge: threre is a bug
[6:10:50] TrooperHuge: you need to seperat all 3
[6:10:57] windatar: Can't tank sheep, sheep doesn't have an aggro table.
[6:11:01] steevwtf: frayed wiring is sheep stun
[6:11:06] osopolar1977: dragon breath
[6:11:09] steevwtf: o wait no thats the reflect
[6:11:37] windatar: If the sheep gets close to other bosses it can pass its reflect to other bosses. That might be whats killing people.
[6:11:40] Trav_Where: everyone needs to stay away from sheep
[6:11:45] osopolar1977: he was eating chips no shield block
[6:11:52] Bearcause: cant believe theyre wiping when sardaco has top views on his guide LUL
[6:11:52] concernedviewer4: tank turtle in corner with flame shield, kick horse when spray and its izi pizi
[6:11:53] lickmypetals: yes speak up
[6:11:54] osopolar1977: lol
[6:12:00] mushroomdood: @staysafetv good evening  Mr
[6:12:04] dantheman4489: BOOMIE FORM
[6:12:05] fuguelah: holding for more power
[6:12:06] steevwtf: go man mode, i started raging and calling shots and we finished :)
[6:12:15] bmnjnjk: can you shgow nhow much heals the shadow priest is doing? LUL
[6:12:23] cook_pc: you should release a video calling for gnomer nerfs
[6:12:44] tsetse2fly: sardaco missing motw
[6:12:45] steevwtf: gnomer nerfs LUL plz no
[6:12:47] ticeyx: lol ive never seen a 3x tank strat on this
[6:12:50] sanjisan69: sheep is problem, you can kite dragon closer to others so it takes a little cleave, just gotta call out breath
[6:12:50] snake_like: we dragged the three bosses around the area to keep it away from sheep. you can keep aoe'ing and keep them all in your peripheral that way
[6:12:54] Trav_Where: the last 2 bosses require a lot of communication
[6:12:55] bmnjnjk: Don't most of the people in your group play wow for a living? KEKW
[6:12:56] Bearcause: @cook_pc youre a joking for sure this raid is ez
[6:13:02] windatar: I mean, it could work. But this fight is essentially a constant circle fight. As long as you keep moving its game.
[6:13:06] osopolar1977: the mechanics are more just annoying last 2 bosses
[6:13:09] steevwtf: @ticeyx struggling groups like to do 3 tank or 3 heal for this. its a tank/heal heavy fight
[6:13:14] Bearcause: just watch my highlight first try we got last boss full ougs
[6:13:32] cook_pc: @Bearcause does this look easy to you
[6:13:48] elpatron1111: whats all this talking lol
[6:13:52] FrostsWorld: KEKW
[6:13:57] windatar: @steevwtf I mean, if a class has mail gear it can tank a boss. Ret pallies and Feral druids do great here.
[6:13:57] Bearcause: @cook_pc at first no for sure but when cleared it is. just like BfD trust
[6:14:03] zichclassic: they are overthinking this fight so much, just interupt the squirrel kill the egg dont suicide on the sheep and dodge breath
[6:14:19] concernedviewer4: three flutes to the left and one tank stand in circle, engage when soaked and go
[6:14:23] osopolar1977: now he gotta healthstone
[6:14:25] mattygisme: The priceless facial expression!
[6:14:25] photek_tn: haha the timing of that joke
[6:14:28] Bearcause: @zichclassic exactly
[6:14:28] nocontrast: what #try is this?
[6:14:31] fuguelah: dont have to heal if you never get the runes I guess
[6:14:59] OldBayKing: Hope you saved that PUG discord for next lockout
[6:15:01] osopolar1977: all these PvP getting sweaty palms
[6:15:02] NutterCircus: I can tell Staysafe is on the edge.
[6:15:07] bmnjnjk: yeah if you are tanking the dragon you just move out of the fire...
[6:15:12] nocontrast: mage sounds sad
[6:15:16] blueRAID3R: sounds like he wants to cry
[6:15:16] steevwtf: it helps if someone is calling where the dragon is pointing early, lets everyone else be more aware of other things
[6:15:19] zichclassic: they dont need more healing bruh
[6:15:20] MrChaynes: having fun? KEKW
[6:15:21] WhoHazCake: clearly we need everyone healing
[6:15:21] KGWay: This is worse than day 1 phase 2
[6:15:21] Trav_Where: mage really doesn't wanna heal
[6:15:26] JoeBango: oom instantly
[6:15:26] Wildstar_Player: heals dont work off fire?
[6:15:27] JoeBango: lol

[6:15:49] zichclassic: thats not how the works lmao
[6:15:53] 3kmmr7kskill: is this top guild on the server
[6:15:54] ticeyx: i mean this in the nicest way possible, this is going to be great
[6:15:54] rjhasnoclue: living bomb won't heal anything will it lol
[6:16:02] bmnjnjk: Sooooooo Pugs from now on? @StaysafeTV
[6:16:02] photek_tn: @Trav_Where doesnt have it
[6:16:33] NutterCircus: Shit, mobs are all clustered...
[6:16:33] steevwtf: all 4 of my raids have been pugs, i feel like a damn pro now LUL
[6:16:35] bmnjnjk: soooo whys the dragon being tanked right next to the others LUL
[6:16:43] Noilane: KEKW
[6:16:53] osopolar1977: to many Bong rips
[6:16:59] Trav_Where: @photek_tn i thought he was just trying to get out of helping with heals
[6:17:04] zichclassic: the 3 bosses should be together besides sheep not spread out...
[6:17:15] zichclassic: this strat is so complicated and bad
[6:17:18] CookieClickerLegend: just innervate yourself
[6:17:54] NutterCircus: sheep FailFish
[6:18:13] steevwtf: on my mage the buttons actually provide a good amount of mana, i never run out with them + all the other consumes
[6:18:35] NutterCircus: sonii is tanking too close to sheep.
[6:18:36] bmnjnjk: Why is there 3 tanks? Heals cant handle one guy tanking squirrel and chicken? LUL LUL LUL
