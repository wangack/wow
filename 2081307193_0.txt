[0:40:07] xglockless: no heâ€™s not @br0nxow  I think this is some homebrew stuff
[0:40:23] Trust_317: Throw a wide net you can always delete or buy more later
[0:40:34] jesseraibourn: am I dumb just bc I donâ€™t understand games like this
[0:40:36] veroqx: how does spellblade feel to play so far?
[0:40:42] Trust_317: Block whatever events you guys don't want to do like maybe arena
[0:40:45] JoyNotTaken: GalaxyUnpacked
[0:40:49] BariNgozi: @jesseraibourn It's just reading stats man
[0:40:51] potatohjay: @xglockless yeah im loving it. fire explosions everywhere and then 3 fire runic invocation is the giant firebal
[0:40:57] CCT25: Damn looks like another diablo
[0:41:11] RealBalckeN: thats rare
[0:41:11] Stak0: yo @shroud what's ur favorite ARPG so far?
[0:41:12] Linksverso: @shroud any comments per hour about RMR Americas?
[0:41:13] ravvau_: falt and %
[0:41:15] RealBalckeN: its almost bis
[0:41:17] ravvau_: flat*
[0:41:18] mertceliks0: why is there no one here
[0:41:21] poohpi3: hp% is hybrid
[0:41:25] shotz999fl: wait so is he done w siege for a bit after the 1v1?
[0:41:26] kokole1: hybrid health is BiS
[0:41:35] jesseraibourn: @baringozi just looks like to much detail in everything itâ€™s overwhelming lol
[0:41:37] Mazen2017: critical strike avoidance is needed for high corruption
[0:41:40] ravvau_: it's flat health as well as % health
[0:41:44] RealBalckeN: it really good
[0:41:59] larpera: But how do you gain shield?
[0:42:00] cosmin284: fuegoHi everyone good evening happy Monday fuegoL fuegoH
[0:42:02] Daikoozi: yeah he's squishy regardless right?
[0:42:02] RealBalckeN: yeah not for ward users
[0:42:06] notxpedro99: !build
[0:42:07] MidnightNoodlee: can you scale ward with hp ?
[0:42:11] officialblackfire: most ward generation is based on health amount
[0:42:13] DonkeyKong711: DonkeyKong711 subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 69 months! 
[0:42:14] bronkz1210: some builds can use % health to give ward, so higher health = higher ward
[0:42:17] Trust_317: If you are doing ward... and you drain life to get ward... health is bis... health gives more ward
[0:42:23] BariNgozi: @jesseraibourn When you're making a build you ignore like 85% of the stats in the game, it's not hard
[0:42:26] GaktuS: depends on how you scale the ward most of ward scaling is through max hp
[0:42:27] grzegorz7777777: je heart
[0:42:33] MrVucis: You can target farm twisted heart which converts your health to ward
[0:42:39] cosmin284: doing great have a great fun last epoch hardcore stream on twich shroud
[0:42:45] potatohjay: drain life is a warlock ability, hes a mage
[0:42:46] kokole1: with the uniques it works that way
[0:42:46] SlayerIuna: there is a chest where it drains life to get ward
[0:42:47] cosmin284: fuegoRave fuegoSpin fuegoVibe
[0:42:54] Daikoozi: twisted heart would drain life for ward
[0:42:56] cosmin284: DinoDance
[0:43:03] zamzyhhh: you gonna play siege this stream bro?
[0:43:07] sens1tiv: good day
[0:43:42] G_Castro: looks like a diablo dlc for poor ppl
[0:44:04] Demented_Streams: @g_castro except itâ€™s way better than Diablo lol
[0:44:07] ItsjustHoffa: D4 is trash, but sure
[0:44:08] cosmin284: vibee fuegoVibe
[0:44:15] FellowNick: Thinking about getting this game since I am over D4, is this worth it?
[0:44:26] TurdBurgison: @G_Castro funny cause diablo suck and this game doesnt LUL
[0:44:33] Stealthy: @FellowNick far better game than d4, can get tons of hours out of it. Definitely worth.
[0:44:38] drummerjt: Haha yea d4 is garbage
[0:44:50] Daikoozi: This game has a way better gameplay loop than D4
[0:44:51] renneh1: d4 bad
[0:44:51] Lastinstanz: @g_castro thats true ðŸ˜‚
[0:44:57] G_Castro: d4 is garbage, this looks like d3
[0:44:59] leamii55: name of the game !
[0:45:00] FellowNick: @Stealthy Ok good to know
[0:45:03] GaktuS: @FellowNick its 10 times better than d4 atleast, biggest gripe right now is a lack of endgame diversity but the game is very good
[0:45:16] leamii55: guys
[0:45:17] Stealthy: @FellowNick im 1,600 hours in and still having fun if that gives you an idea..

[0:45:41] FellowNick: @Stealthy Oh wow! I thought the games new but thats crazy and good to know
[0:45:50] Broom2100: @oxycoppin710 definitely more fun than Diablo
[0:45:56] sir_lunchalot22: @Stealthy 1600 hours just says youre an arpg degenerate LUL
[0:45:57] GaktuS: honestly you would be making a diservice to this game to compare it to diablo because its so much better
[0:46:04] SKC_Unlimited: @shroud how is the scaling in this game? does it have slugging grind points?
[0:46:04] Daikoozi: @FellowNick it's been in EA for a bit, just released a little bit ago officially
[0:46:17] kokole1: you should filter for hybrid health to shatter
[0:46:18] armed_newb: no1 looks at diablo anymore. that game has failed
[0:46:20] junkojohnsonda3: wsggg shroud how yo sexy self been lordhe31A @shroud

[0:49:28] sir_lunchalot22: @shadorien hades is much faster...no rest 4 the wicked is very tactical etc, like a souls game
[0:49:40] CreativeNative8: So i'm only just tuning in, how would you compare this to Diablo series and POE ?
[0:49:46] watekuon: Use lottery
[0:49:50] KDPlays_: @shadorien yh almost, but the graphics are more mordernized, gameplay is out tho so you should check it out
[0:50:00] Potatoooe: Id recommend hiding normal/magic items at this point of your character, they dont have enough forging potential to craft on usually
[0:50:01] ChubbyMikey: @psynytes just9nKiss just9nKiss just9nKiss
[0:50:03] armed_newb: @CreativeNative8 just dont compare them. research the game yourself you will get more answers that way
[0:50:06] PsyNytes: MUCH better @ChubbyMikey
[0:50:07] KDPlays_: @Exialyser never heard of that so that makes sense lmao
[0:50:15] siremethyr: @CreativeNative8 better then diablo cool like Poe
[0:50:18] tekstyleso: Wokege no rest?
[0:50:23] Stealthy: @CreativeNative8 Far better than D4 and less complex than PoE.. The perfect middle ground.

[0:51:01] armed_newb: pretty sure that game going to suffer with no content for a very long time
[0:51:01] b0wzur: get a loot filter picking stuff up to sell is waste of time
[0:51:14] ChubbyMikey: @PsyNytes you play any more?
[0:51:18] popaz_: do you have filters to only see the ones you need?
[0:51:20] PsyNytes: Yes @ChubbyMikey
[0:51:22] ravvau_: Show hide all white/blue/yellow and then show certain affix/bases you want for shattering or use
[0:51:24] ItsBorland: @shroud this game owns tbh, been having a blast playing something that isn't POE for once LUL
[0:51:30] ChubbyMikey: @PsyNytes get levels?
[0:51:38] ravvau_: you should hide*
[0:51:39] PsyNytes: Yeah, not sure what Im at now tho @ChubbyMikey
[0:51:43] GaktuS: make a new filter rule for items with affixes you want to shatter and hide the rest trust
[0:51:45] Exialyser: @KDPlays_ yep, game is a meh, but still feel like every swing and rolls matter
[0:51:54] watekuon: Is this hardcore?
[0:52:00] shadorien: sell like sell to vendor? isnt it cheap af
[0:52:02] ItsBorland: @watekuon HC in title

[0:53:15] kawboose: @FrranchiizE Depends on how much people donate

[0:53:34] FrranchiizE: @PsyNytes you swear?
[0:53:37] Mulliner: the higher the tier of the affix you're trying to seal, the less chance to despair. @shroud
[0:53:58] kawboose: @FrranchiizE Tis illegal to not disclose such things
[0:54:00] armed_newb: yeah a tier 1 affix almost always gets the seal on first try
[0:54:06] CUbuffs1: you get 5 affixes
[0:54:06] RealBalckeN: you will have 5 total affixes
[0:54:07] shadorien: free slot for affix

[0:54:15] potatohjay: @FrranchiizE its literally a law requiring you to show ad
[0:54:16] holysage: LUL
[0:54:21] KUCZ3K: !commands
[0:54:21] j4yd0t: its a 5th stat
[0:54:21] Fossabot: @KUCZ3K here's a link to his commands: https://fossabot.com/shroud/commands
[0:54:24] Ragingsofty: "permanent"
[0:54:25] marcus_kincaid: Kissed by a Rose
[0:54:26] b0wzur: basically allows you to have a 5th stat on item
[0:54:28] KDPlays_: u go from 4 affixes to 5 affixes, the sealed one is permanent
[0:54:30] naptimethegod: left and right side of the item
[0:54:31] Mulliner: @shroud if you successfully seal, your item can have 5 affixes
[0:54:34] ravvau_: It just opens up the slot the affix was on without actually losing that affix
[0:54:37] 3fs__: basically its just goes to implicits
[0:54:45] 3fs__: and you have extra slot for another mod
[0:54:46] tyr2169: You make 1 passive and open a slot
[0:54:48] KDPlays_: but there is a risk it doesnt seal, and rng for the affix it chooses too
[0:54:50] jokai_: essentially, you move an affix to a special slot that you can't alter to free up the slot that it took up @shroud
[0:55:08] jebuzz: The lower the tier the more likely to seal
[0:55:09] j4yd0t: @shroud its a 5th stat you cant modify
[0:55:10] AKmumu: I seal an affix I dont want to put the affix I want on it
[0:55:18] SlayerIuna: use it and see what happens
[0:55:28] shadorien: just seal any affix you like on your items
[0:55:31] MrVucis: T1 100% chance to seal and it drops heigher the tier is
[0:55:33] OhYeahitsKT: shroudWat
[0:55:36] KDPlays_: you want to seal a lower tier attribute you want for higher chance
[0:55:37] egesenyuva: try first and see how works
[0:55:40] gr3mp: its locking an affix in that can't be removed and adding a fifth affix that you can't normally do
[0:55:41] scrambleguy: what games would u say u play often/ currently known for @shroud
[0:55:42] sir_lunchalot22: your chat gpt in your discord has a hard time explaining it sadly
[0:55:45] ChubbyNinjaDuck: you're sealing the affix onto the item as a parament stat  allowing you to add another affix in its place as well @shroud
[0:55:49] 0xygenhomie: You seal an affix and remove it from the prefix/suffix pool
[0:55:50] Fossabot: Follow Mike on Twitter https://twitter.com/shroud
[0:55:51] grzegorz7777777: G - Guide
[0:56:02] ravvau_: Think of it as turning an affix into an implicit
[0:56:07] 3fs__: earlier "I have tons " kappa
[0:56:08] babyballout: how did you get the crystal sword
[0:56:09] Ironcow16: you keep an affix so if you reroll the modifiers the kept affix will not change
[0:56:13] AKmumu: Seal a T1 affix you dont like just to put it aside and put your own affix in the slot you freed
[0:56:21] jokai_: would be easier to just watch a yt video at this point LUL
[0:56:28] jodrion: still 10x less complicated than poe crafting
[0:56:29] Potatoooe: Look at it as opening a 5th slot on your item pretty much @shroud
[0:56:35] KDPlays_: yh you may understand it if you try it
[0:56:37] neversleepgamer: The affix that gets sealed is random
[0:56:43] AKmumu: @neversleepgamer its not
[0:56:46] CClearTV: Tbh, his explanation is lacking concrete, understandable examples.
[0:56:49] Jeccc_: sealing T1 and T2 helpful affix is the best move
[0:56:59] insaniity: nerd @CClearTV
[0:56:59] Fossabot: Join the Shroudcord Discord, now open for everyone! discord.gg/shroud
[0:57:03] j4yd0t: @CClearTV lmao ikr, "put the stat aside" what xD
[0:57:10] sir_lunchalot22: if youre sealing affixes you dont like or want...you just waste the despair rune wtf KEKW
[0:57:14] Trust_317: Just remember with sealing t1 is easy t4 almost impossible and t2 or t3 get harder respectively
[0:57:18] neversleepgamer: @AKmumu oh my bad, how does it work then?
[0:57:22] armed_newb: did your relic have +skill levels? if it did you probably lost a skill point on your skill tree because you temporarily unequipped it @shroud
[0:57:33] goldcrumb: wats the build?
[0:57:38] 3fs__: just farm your attack blink and reave
[0:57:40] Proxer_b: its literally locks one of the affix and gives you 1 empty affix slot
[0:57:42] shadorien: spellblade pewpew
[0:57:50] neversleepgamer: @AKmumu oh its an experimental affix only
[0:58:07] mandziakgra: that crit Oo
[0:58:10] ibypier: KEKW
[0:58:17] CClearTV: @j4yd0t Exactly :D I mean, if that person could explain it in the way that a 5 year old could understand, it would be a good explanation. For example- does the sealed affix remain active? When you put it aside, does that free up a slot for another affix to be put on? Can you modify the sealed affix? and so on
[0:58:25] shadorien: holy essay
[0:58:33] fygfloyd: this game looks wildly confusing
[0:58:40] Mulliner: TLDR: Despairing a T1 affix will either upgrade it (not seal) or move it to a sealed affix location. It'll use a random amount of FP to do the action. Once sealed, that affix can no longer be upgraded, but opens up the affix slot it once absorbed.
[0:58:40] whozRAGE: whozRAGE subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 30 months! 
[0:58:43] PrinceSano123x: @shroud when you playing more siege?
[0:58:44] Planet__Nine: its amazing how little people are willing to read these days.
[0:58:51] Stealthy: @fygfloyd It's not and it has an impressive in-game guide you can use to learn anything you need to know.
[0:58:54] armed_newb: bro if any1 has an issue with learning what Sealing an affix means just open the ingame wiki and read it. its not complicated
[0:59:00] 0xygenhomie: this is a pretty straightforward game with enough depth to be engaging
[0:59:09] Jeccc_: @Mulliner im pretty sure T1 is 100% guaranteed to be sealed
[0:59:14] shadorien: @Planet__Nine could be quality of the writing
[0:59:18] nositive: !sensvalorant
[0:59:26] nositive: !sens
[0:59:27] Fossabot: @nositive, looking for his sensitivity for a specific game? Type the game name and sens - like !valorantsens or !apexsens
[0:59:33] AKmumu: @neversleepgamer You choose the affix you want to seal and the lower the tier is the higher the chance to seal it, its different from the experimental one
[0:59:36] Planet__Nine: @shadorien could be, or people just lazy.
[0:59:36] nositive: !valorantsens
[0:59:37] Fossabot: @nositive Valorant: Sens: 0.38 - Scoped 1 | DPI: 800 - Windows: 6/11 - Raw-Input: On - 1000 Hz Polling Rate
[0:59:38] Mulliner: @Jeccc_ sorry, you're right. T1 == 100%, T2 == 70% (I believe) and so on.
[0:59:40] utilizator_goat: DIABLO?
[0:59:40] fygfloyd: @Stealthy oh sick that's rad
[0:59:43] H5TERiA: I put volumetric lighting to very low and it's been fine
[0:59:45] ravvau_: 3 ways?
[0:59:47] Willox_: i literally had to take off a skill as it was the main cause for big frame drops
[0:59:47] Mambashii: It was worse a year ago. They came a long way
[0:59:49] ravvau_: or 4 ways or what ever?
[0:59:51] Jeccc_: @Mulliner yup sounds about right
