[1:05:42] emznev: so where is it they are getting this data that people do not want lfg? because evry person i have talked to wants it lol
[1:06:01] Noti88: are you going to play Dragonflight?
[1:06:01] fkinthiccbro: i mean it's not gonna affect me much cuz premade groups, but i kinda ont want lfg :p

[1:08:25] Kisswani: 77 I think
[1:08:28] Kisswani: or 78
[1:08:33] emznev: 78
[1:08:35] delmok: howling fjord is so much faster with less travel time. you'll level in borean but it will be slower
[1:08:56] SneakyFoxtrot: @Towelliee Do you level faster in wrath?
[1:08:59] mewkittymon: 78 for flying I think
[1:09:02] Nexos: It was 77 100% and if you can't afford it there was a free gryphon in K3 in Storm peaks
[1:09:03] Kisswani: with dragon riding they have a chance to create a zone like storm peaks
[1:09:34] Zivs: follow the meta or else stoopzzAngry
[1:09:46] fkinthiccbro: exacly my point, everyone is gonna go howling, i dont wanna wait fr mo spawns :D
[1:09:46] theszoti: do you think they will bring back the emmisaries in dragonflight?
[1:09:46] Sennenwald94: I actually think Prefox just chose both rolls in case. But he is goofing around in fury spec, so i guess he wants to DPS

[1:15:30] MrGattz: yeah its fake. says so in the title
[1:15:30] Eithos87: wrath classic
[1:15:36] Prayshock: I think the hype isn't there as much because there wasn't a proper lead up to the beta. Most people I know didn't even know the beta was live this week.
[1:16:22] obbi87: Its going to be super cool, to apply for HC dungeons in the LFG system and get declined over and over, like M+ as a pugger in retail. SUPER gameplay.
[1:17:06] pealladk: someone has a post that explains all i cant believe it

[1:18:23] pealladk: i cant believe its 14 year old and now play beta i thought its fake
[1:18:53] jkitchin75: hes trolling right?
[1:18:54] Eithos87: @pealladk have you heard of classic?
[1:19:03] Kisswani: @pealladk they are releasing wrath classic later in the year and this a beta for it
[1:19:10] Droobear: what is your gear like? can you test if it's effective to solo tbc dungeons for exp?
[1:19:16] Darwoo: I LOVED the citadel raid
[1:19:39] Rudric_Ice: feels less hype than tbc tbh
[1:20:01] Darwoo: when was flying introduced to wow?
[1:20:01] Kisswani: maybe also because the preorders are here as well , being are into DF mode
[1:20:05] BlackS0L0: Towelliee so you’re gonna level a character in beta and do it all again on live?
[1:20:07] Begga91: What do we think about the new group finder?

[1:20:21] Korupcija_: using group finder Pog
[1:20:45] Eithos87: yea they are trolling
[1:20:55] Prayshock: I think the hype will get bigger when they start testing raids and Wintergrasp. You'll get the 24 hr Asmon and Esfand streams that will help hype it up
[1:21:32] Thoreya: Asmon is just waiting for DF alpha lol
[1:21:48] Motivess: when was the last time asmon did a 24 hrs stream
[1:21:57] NieIas: asmon said been there done that
[1:22:02] giffeln23: why r people acting like a beta means no one is hyped? guarantee wotlk will have way more players than tbc lmfao
[1:22:07] Korupcija_: asmon went full variety/reacting
[1:22:09] Rudric_Ice: he was crying about pre orders yesterday
[1:22:12] emznev: we just need dragon flight alpha at this point
[1:22:32] Thoreya: He said he gon play DF alpha as soon as it launches yesterday and all the FF peeps threw a fit lmao
[1:22:32] Motivess: @rudric_ice that was McConnell
[1:22:35] TheCakeBadger: McConnell was mad lol
[1:22:35] DeanoTV: he has a video titled "dont pre order Dragonflight" FailFish
[1:22:35] obbi87: @Prayshock The hype will come for sure, in the start atleast. But when the majority "casuals" gets to the endgame and play Queue sim in the LFG, forget it.
[1:22:40] fooxytv: i was expecting the osrs treatment from the start

[2:16:21] Sanctana827: Sanctana827 subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 25 months! 
[2:16:38] GreatWhiteDav: 80 in 2 days is no-shower tier
[2:16:45] atoker: dungeons are fun
[2:16:45] Jewishraver: i think it was wrath-cata is when i lvled most of the toons i have due to the xp gain back then
[2:16:59] Sanctana827: Did blizzard mention anything about realm first achievements for Wrath classic?
[2:17:07] The_Metal_Man: did they make raid wide buffing a thing in wrath or was it later
[2:17:14] gdcotton: Respawn rates are so damn high that it wont be a problem, look at isle of quel'denas on mankrik as an example. I was able to easily do all my dailies in 20-ish minutes
[2:17:17] Jewishraver: i remember being able to get to like lvl 80 within 4 hours from 1

[2:17:49] cruzeal: monkaS
[2:18:05] Jewishraver: @Jewishraver back in the day, doing instaces was fast as fuck for xp, as a tank 4 hours i got max llv
[2:18:06] Trexxter: @Sanctana827 do not remember them spicify.. but in vanilla wrath they introduced the achievements and they were available
[2:18:18] iamcbb: How does the new dungeon finder work
[2:18:34] einself111: also how many layers they add
[2:18:37] GreatWhiteDav: @iamcbb very similar to retail group finder, just not cross realm
[2:18:47] Sanctana827: @Trexxter SeemsGood
[2:18:48] Jewishraver: will the LFG thing be cross server or one server @Towelliee ?
[2:18:49] Haximaxi: they will layer the crap out of any server at launch though, even my medium pve server had 15 layers at tbc launch
[2:18:54] cruzeal: RF monkaS
[2:19:06] Clicklesly: Was Salv still a thing in Wrath?
[2:19:24] zack68: salv is a thing, just reduced threat every second instead of being a perma buff
[2:19:32] zack68: for 10 seconds
[2:19:42] weplord: @Clicklesly blessing? yeah
[2:19:59] TheCakeBadger: Ah the good ol days of rage quuts on first mob

[2:21:24] madmatildahc: 0 addons?
[2:21:24] cruzeal: lol
[2:21:29] madmatildahc: looks pretty good
[2:21:29] Sanctana827: @LangsyTV actually, I think someone did. may have been 6 hours, but someone found a respawn area and just grinded mobs
[2:21:37] Faxanadu1: @Towelliee I know you're not playing one currently but will dual wield blood tank in WOTLK classic? That was my jam back in the day! I may have to resub for that!
[2:21:43] madmatildahc: oh yea
[2:22:03] Sanctana827: iirc it was some skeleton mound area that respawned all the time
[2:22:26] gdcotton: Im having spine surgery on my neck to have 2 discs replaced, im allowed to be a degenerate the rest of the year since they wont let me do shit, 5lb weight carry limit for 2-3mo
[2:22:44] zack68: @Faxanadu1 every spec is based on 3.3.5 talents and duel wield blood isnt really as good as 2h. Still viable but not as good
[2:23:19] Faxanadu1: @zack68 thanks for the info! I just remember having a lot of fun with it in those early days lol
[2:23:25] cruzeal: the warrior must be a chonker

[2:23:38] Moobot: @Broomba it usually takes ~45 mins after going live to start. its been 02:23:45 since he went live. grab some snacks or go do something, the stream will start soon™
[2:23:55] cruzeal: lol
[2:23:57] zack68: @Faxanadu1 oh yeah same, i love duel wield frost tanking. You still can do any spec for dungeons but youll probably want a more normal spec like blood for raiding the later tiers
[2:24:15] zack68: Prefox is used to being on the floor in dungeons and raids

[2:24:48] AmaterasuS: don't have seal of command yet?

[2:29:31] CritcobainTV: prefox is a monster
[2:29:35] quakegoogl: lul
[2:30:00] CritcobainTV: nobod on tomb KEKW
[2:30:02] CritcobainTV: nobody*
[2:30:12] CritcobainTV: Ret should kinda pump
[2:30:42] Sndhelp: is there a reason for not using seal of command (the aoe seal?)
[2:31:01] Sndhelp: ah hes 70 nvm!
[2:31:36] prettylaidback1: how much less xp with 5
[2:31:41] wraaith: RF not having a duration is pretty cool
[2:31:48] wraaith: the small changes
[2:32:10] The_Metal_Man: the expertise or hit glyph was pretty sweet
[2:32:30] CritcobainTV: I'm so hyped for wotlk, I might even start dragonflight late to play more of wrath
[2:32:31] nephttv_: I kinda miss glyphs. The pally one where you could toss consecration at range was cool
[2:32:45] Enoxios: are heal shamys bad in wotlk? cant remember
[2:32:56] CritcobainTV: command is busted for aoe, yeah
[2:33:02] AmaterasuS: seal of command is tanking seal
[2:33:17] wraaith: talent
[2:33:19] CritcobainTV: Seal of command is an aoe seal, its not a tanking seal lol
[2:33:20] WhiteKnight74648: AngelThump
[2:33:22] AmaterasuS: 71 minimum if you go hammer of righteous it's in ret tree
[2:33:24] wraaith: part way down ret tree
[2:33:25] CritcobainTV: its in the ret tree
[2:33:25] zastin586: as far as I remember it was vengeance for single target and righteousness for cleave
[2:33:28] Harska: as a tank you should get command too for trash
[2:33:49] AmaterasuS: it's in 3rd row of ret
[2:33:50] CritcobainTV: Im saying it's in the ret tree for aoe dps, its good for tanknig but you still use it for ret
[2:33:55] Alaquane: 15 points in ret talent tree?
[2:33:56] embracedead: seal of command for aoe and corruption for bosses
[2:34:10] AmaterasuS: my build I've prepared is literally getting it at 71 :D
[2:34:14] atoker: it's a ret talent that gives you a seal that gives your judgements extra damage against stunned targets
[2:34:22] wraaith: drop 1 in prot for it
[2:34:27] heavenphist: oh so SoC changes in wrath to cleave? nice
[2:34:33] CritcobainTV: @GhostBLAZEtv different in wotlk, it does aoe now
[2:35:00] CritcobainTV: I'm bout to do a big succ to get up in this beta
[2:35:04] dormdotz: you testing dungeon farming or just doing a run?
[2:35:32] PurplePyrex: @Critcobain make sure those desk screws are tight asf y'no
[2:35:35] Broomba: Those wow background sounds like a church bell gong going off
[2:35:42] CritcobainTV: @PurplePyrex ofc
[2:36:12] CritcobainTV: if you can do dungeons in 20 minutes it's gonna be worth on a high pop server, otherwise it hink questing will be better if it's less contested
[2:36:19] mavericks312: morning towel
[2:36:20] PurplePyrex: @Critcobain want some kneepads?
[2:36:41] CritcobainTV: on servers like Benediction or Faerlina, i think dungeons are the way to go, the huge population will make questing much harder
[2:36:47] einself111: oh god i hope not
[2:36:49] hyliak: is dual specc already there?
[2:36:56] CritcobainTV: yeah it is @hyliak
[2:36:58] Colt_Engineer: beep boop fun detected
[2:37:04] dormdotz: dungeon farming to lvl is a wow tradition at this point
[2:37:17] RealJayJay_TV: yo Towelliee whats your gear like right now? Im surprised to see you seem to have a few threat issues
[2:37:21] hyliak: nice, means prepatch will likely hvae it as well
[2:37:44] CritcobainTV: @RealJayJay_TV IIRC tow stopped during phase 1 so he wasn't geared
[2:38:02] CritcobainTV: at least when the guild fell apart it was just p1 gear
[2:38:20] Praetour: Wont get into any group content if you aren't in a guild but can play the game easily

[2:38:22] mmo_kenna_: WoTLK zones become pretty dead once everyone reaches max and afk in dalaran
[2:38:23] RealJayJay_TV: Makes sense you cant hold threat vs the probably sunwell (?) geared warrior lol
[2:38:26] Alaquane: Someone asked about xp per mob kills with 4  players versus 5 players. He's getting a tiny bit MORE with 5 players. The little ghouls were 231xp with 4. 249xp with 5.
[2:38:30] gdcotton: TBC dungeons are also just overtuned damage wise, you pull threat you get 2 tapped as a dps
[2:38:37] Broomba: You can wear white gear from vanilla and win
[2:38:40] Aquadriel: faster than chats mom blows me.
[2:38:59] CritcobainTV: lmao, prefoxy just fuckin pumps
[2:39:01] elusiveleopard: Prefox is nuts
[2:39:09] swags67: Is it feasible to level as tank specs? Like druids as an example?
[2:39:34] CritcobainTV: @Alaquane pretty sure that's the other way around though? you get more xp with 4 instead of 5, at least that's what the other xp values had shown

[2:39:35] mmrghost7: did go to class trainer and get new abilities get removed in wrath ?
[2:39:42] gdcotton: Wait, did they say they were making heroics harder??
[2:39:44] CritcobainTV: @swags67 yeah, tanks kinda pump
[2:40:06] Harska: @swags67 id say all tank viable classes are better to lvl as tank than dps espescially if u are bit lower geared
[2:40:11] Broomba: @mmrghost7 nope still there
[2:40:13] lvl49rogue: @Towelliee how u enjoying the beta so far?
[2:40:25] gdcotton: Im ok with that, they were a joke to do
[2:40:25] NextLifeAfter: LUL they def couldnt make heroics easier thats for fuck sure
[2:40:28] CritcobainTV: @gdcotton They said they want heroics to be challenging all through the xpac so they're gonna implement challenges @Towelliee
[2:40:29] tronbadgames: sam article as making naxx harder?
[2:40:34] AmaterasuS: heroics were super easy before anyways even a 100% buff woulod be easy
[2:40:34] tronbadgames: same*
[2:41:18] Praetour: Affixes for sure
[2:41:19] CritcobainTV: WOTLK M+ POGGERS
[2:41:23] Alaquane: @Critcobain the little mobs were giving more. but you're right with overall I think. I just rewatched the boss xp. Prince Keleseth was 4836 with 4, 4169 with 5
[2:41:24] tronbadgames: that sounds like challenge mode added later
[2:41:25] HawtPepperTuna: remember challenge modes in MoP?

[2:42:29] dormdotz: ez new players will have all that gdkp gold to buy radi gear to skip heroics
[2:42:40] CritcobainTV: @Alaquane I believe it's because the multiplier in wotlk beta right now for elite mobs is 275% instead of 200% so the elites give more than the small mobs? i cant recall the exact % for elites though
[2:42:54] embracedead: to ur right
[2:43:12] Srdjan91: you will probably need better ilvl or gs to unlock harder heroics
[2:43:14] HawtPepperTuna: to the routh
[2:43:17] CritcobainTV: I think cata would be fine, its just dungeons not raids
[2:43:53] mmo_kenna_: Hc+ ??
[2:43:54] CritcobainTV: I'm just glad they're trying to do something about boosting, that's pretty dope
[2:43:58] gdcotton: I am PRAYING that the fresh servers never allow transfers to ever come in
[2:44:19] CritcobainTV: @gdcotton they said as long as the population is healthy they wont need to open transfers up if it's sustainable
[2:44:59] CritcobainTV: 67 originally in wotlk, but then it was 68 later on IIRC
[2:45:26] gdcotton: Servers will be fine by then, I have an entire group of 10 people wanting to join and start with the fresh stuff so I hope it stays good
[2:45:46] Kenny65080: hope they bring azjol nerub as a questzone finally, would be a nice gift to ghostcrawler
[2:45:54] CritcobainTV: I've put too much time into my toons to wanna go fresh
[2:46:20] avfc14: looking forward to thr 50% exp boost level a few alts
[2:46:41] CritcobainTV: i meant 77 not 67, sorry, im an idiot lmao
[2:46:51] P4RT1CLEM4N: My characters are stuck on a dead server in Retail.. It's better than it used to be, but finding an active guild is off the table

[2:56:44] fkinthiccbro: it might be that you need the invis buff from the cloak to discover it
[2:56:48] NewWorldReign: You
[2:56:55] wEiRdO_dUdE: There are kind of like three high points in this

[2:57:23] Bac0nLord: read the quest text?
[2:57:33] warrenny: Im borean?
[2:57:34] NewWorldReign: You need to be invincible to do the quest
[2:57:38] wEiRdO_dUdE: You might have to use a cloak, yeah
[2:57:40] grylz89: do you think wotlk will draw in alot of retailers to classic? I think wotlk is the perfect balance for retail Randy's and classic Andy's
[2:58:04] flebbooo: KEKW dammit blizz
[2:58:14] wEiRdO_dUdE: EZ
[2:58:15] TheItalianStallion321: WOOT WE DID IT
[2:58:17] fkinthiccbro: yeah that is a bug i guess xd or it worked like that note sure
[2:58:26] alexander_r: Its S
[2:58:33] alexander_r: kinda SE
[2:59:09] smolglizzy: 2 - 3 years i avoided it, I've got the 'rona and this variant isn't awful but its still annoying.
[2:59:45] Lightasaurus: Get some Paxlovid
[3:00:07] paradoxyy: @TheAkasura jokes on you korona doesnt even exist u got the monkeyflue now Kappa
[3:00:19] smolglizzy: LOL @paradoxyy
[3:00:28] mavericks312: dont they have those covid pills now?
[3:00:39] al3xx077x: @TheAkasura had it at the start of the month, sinus stuff still lingering :(
[3:00:57] Tainted_Morals: i have covid and flu at the same time :(
[3:01:09] smolglizzy: Apparently this variant is pretty short but highly contagious.
[3:01:11] FresheFefe: wotlk looks so ugly
[3:01:16] NieIas: they wont add that to classic
[3:01:26] NieIas: some dev confirmed that in a interview
[3:01:26] bakurathewolf: are there invs going out?
[3:01:44] smolglizzy: @al3xx077x I have pre-existing sinus issues and this just feels like a normal sinus infection crammed in to 2 days (so far)
[3:01:47] Harska: also most of the ppl have full 1½lvl of rested going to wotlk that you dont have in beta
[3:01:50] NBK_Sethus: maybe compared to modern wow, but it's a huge visual improvement over vanilla and tbc
[3:01:51] einself111: go to grizzly hills and tell me that does not look amazing
[3:01:53] Alaquane: wrath was all brown and white except grizzly hills
[3:02:00] prettylaidback1: people still calling the sniffles covid SMFH
[3:02:06] lolingo27: hey are u playing wrath ?

[3:03:12] NieIas: dragonflight LUL
[3:03:27] Artivicii: Watup big T

[3:03:52] wraaith: anyone got ideas for when we will get pre patch
[3:03:52] Srdjan91: hodir quest chain
[3:04:02] smolglizzy: @al3xx077x I think the worst is 101 degree fever and we are in a heat wave down here in the South. My house won't stay below 75 and i typically keep it at 65.
[3:04:27] Artivicii: towByah
[3:04:45] NieIas: 1 zone in DF looks like a updated grizzly hills
[3:04:49] mavericks312: revendreth alone looks better  then all of wrath
[3:05:57] einself111: I still prefer 1 big northrend over serveral instanced zones like in SL

[3:06:01] wyman1990vc: you think they will release some more DF talents today
[3:06:02] RwmLeague: "you guys" hmmm
[3:06:05] RwmLeague: sounds like you have insider information
[3:06:25] wEiRdO_dUdE: It's looking like 4 weeks of Wrath prepatch, which is awesome
[3:06:27] jmalmin: Some people like how this looks. People still play Everquest 1... and that game will not win any beauty rewards in 2022. :)
[3:06:29] MrGharr: thirsty for DF news
[3:06:36] mavericks312: there probably not on any time table anymore
[3:06:52] Kriven: oh they are always on a time table
[3:06:57] Korupcija_: I think it's because of other blizzard games, kinda dumb to release OW and WOW news on same day
[3:07:00] KaisenSiru: Pog
[3:07:05] Damnur: they are gonna 100% delay with the reasoning "we are not ready yet, the game is not yet there where we want it to be"
[3:07:10] Artivicii: Sales n shit
[3:07:13] cruzeal: danCopium
[3:07:16] Aquadriel: snort that copium my dudes
[3:07:23] Damnur: now is about numbers and quarters
[3:07:36] mavericks312: @Damnur 100% they just needed a date to release the pre orders
[3:07:59] ramprager: hey how do you get ebeta access?
[3:08:08] MrGharr: @mavericks312 but they could have wrote 2023, if they wanted to.

[3:08:21] thymos_: just become a streamer and worship blizzard
[3:08:22] TheEndIsNear777: Towelliee Din
[3:08:26] Kriven: i just need them to release the mage talent tree so i have new wow info to be mad about on mmo champ
[3:08:33] Alaquane: click sign up for beta opt-in on the launcher
[3:08:41] wEiRdO_dUdE: There is a signup for beta, but they are doing invites in waves and most are not in it yet
[3:08:52] mavericks312: @MrGharr most games will use 12/31 of said year for a release date just to get pre orders out its quite common
[3:08:53] MrGharr: We need to see a pure dps class and a double healer class.
[3:08:56] wyman1990vc: alpha announcement would be good today relieve some concerns people have about timing.
[3:09:25] Kisswani: which is better imo
[3:09:32] Kisswani: only include people who are interested
[3:09:37] flebbooo: Thats for the best
[3:09:37] Moobot: Plans for WOTLK Beta. Some simple leveling and helping Blizzard test. At first there won't be a lot of people to do content with. That will change when 80 Template comes into play. OH and I don't have Beta keys ask Panda
[3:09:46] wEiRdO_dUdE: Yeah, that makes sense
[3:10:24] GermanBacon: towHi
[3:10:32] heavenphist: oh why is exorcism a cast ability?
[3:10:38] wyman1990vc: good point
[3:11:08] wEiRdO_dUdE: I think DF Alpha might happen next week, it feels close with it being on the catalog thing already
[3:11:16] genovahero: they will just set a date the benefits them and their quarterly earning calls
[3:11:18] mavericks312: id bet most of blizz already knows there gonna delay till next year
[3:11:22] genovahero: they done it for years
[3:11:39] Artivicii: Just do it - Blizzard 2022
[3:11:39] Moobot: towHAMUP TOWELLIEE GOT A NEW ORIGIN GAMING PC! | https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-100631756-15027263 towSO |Specs https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/414625240233148419/857136797167779860/orringpc.png | Towelliee Gaming is proud to be sponsored by ORIGIN PC! They have an excellent 24/7 support team, supreme pc build quality and your PC will arrive at your house in a wooden crate!
[3:12:01] MrGharr: there was a leak that stated a November DF release, and nobody beleaved it.
[3:12:09] Davylz: How can you have two seals active at the same time ?
[3:12:09] rtellez: so paladin in  wotlk will be str based gear?
[3:12:11] mooseliquid: Are we going to be able to play blood dps DK? @towelliee
[3:12:13] wEiRdO_dUdE: It's gotta be close if they are trying for release this year
[3:12:13] ramprager: 3 weeks away from wotkl you mean?
[3:12:16] ramprager: or prepatch
[3:12:17] wyman1990vc: I just hope it blows people away to stop all the crying and complaining...been a year of f*** blizz.
[3:12:29] mavericks312: @MrGharr we still dont believe what lol
[3:12:37] Alaquane: we didnt believe the leaked screenshots either
[3:12:39] Kriven: @wyman1990vc i mean its like this every expansion nothing new here
[3:12:45] tronbadgames: @Towelliee whats your favorite wotlk mount?
[3:12:57] Aquadriel: remember that whatever date you think will release, you have to substract 2-4 weeks for prepatch, which include all new talents and whatever world changes @Towelliee
[3:13:01] Davylz: @Towelliee. How can you have two seals active at the same time ? Is this a talent or smthg ?
[3:13:03] ceranac23: exp in december raid in january?
[3:13:18] mmrghost7: i think they can
[3:13:22] paradoxyy: no shot
[3:13:28] HaxzorJimDuggan: @davylz its a bug its the alliance and horde version of the same thing
[3:13:28] MrGharr: maybe they don't want to test everything, just like in 9.2.5
[3:13:29] Kriven: @Aquadriel i mean he knows this he has been doing it for years on stream lol
[3:13:31] falldrgn: however.. we don't know how far along they are internally
[3:13:31] fcsgamer: What if they skip Alpha and go straight to Beta?
[3:13:34] wyman1990vc: @kriven good point just wears you down as a wow fan
[3:13:35] mmrghost7: no borrowed power to work on
[3:13:37] Atma23: Seems like a bad sign that we have a release date with no actual gameplay reveals yet
[3:13:46] GermanBacon: the question isnt if they can, but if they should... kinamaHmm
[3:13:50] Ithylz: I think they said they posted the talent trees to already collect feedback so I'm not sure it is just an example
[3:13:50] paradoxyy: @fcsgamer  with like 900000 things to test? xd
[3:13:50] 91Niki: July 14th— oof guess Gattz and I won’t be around for that :( we got holiday plans then
[3:13:51] jmalmin: Still very worried that dragonflight is a bare bones expansion.
[3:13:55] mavericks312: my question is does the talent system drop in pre patch or the xpac cause that could allieviate some problems
[3:13:56] wEiRdO_dUdE: They say there are a couple of hundred people in Team 2, it's possible... it's just a lot of work
[3:14:07] Aquadriel: we will just have to wait for alpha and see how 'advanced' the build is.
[3:14:11] bob_the_demon: All depends on how far along they are on the "bones" of the expansion.
[3:14:15] Sollice: @fcsgamer Ehh that would be bad. Alpha is a much smaller more dedicated group of people who finds bugs. When it comes to beta most people are there to play and discover and not try to bug hunt
[3:14:22] fcsgamer: @paradoxyy they have internal testers...
[3:14:27] tronbadgames: not to mention a whole new class...
[3:14:38] HaxzorJimDuggan: got me some gas station grits this morning, amazing
[3:14:45] NBK_Sethus: 2022 release date sounds too soon
[3:14:49] wEiRdO_dUdE: @mavericks312 I would think in DF prepatch we get the trees along with Evoker
[3:14:54] wyman1990vc: @towelliee you gonna try the evoker?
[3:14:54] MrGharr: borrowed power is actually easier to develop, because it won't last multiple expansions.
[3:14:57] Sollice: @91Niki Are you saying holiday plans like it's a holiday, or you saying holiday like Euros doing meaning vacation :P

[3:14:59] ShadowDMG6969: 180 per class
[3:15:12] thymos_: they have the money and manpower
[3:15:18] mavericks312: tbf the talents are probably whats taking up most of there time
[3:15:21] NieIas: first 9.2 PTR was very late but very feature complete, maybe they want the same for DF alpha
[3:15:24] wyman1990vc: same I thought the evoker looked badass
[3:15:24] tronbadgames: evoker heals hopefully feels good
[3:15:27] Destinos: yep but they didn't show anything, so people are speculating .
[3:15:27] paradoxyy: @fcsgamer  u want another bfa /shadowlands or should u sit on ur asss and wait 3 more month for a better 2 year?
[3:15:36] 91Niki: @sollice Vacation for you weird Americans haha
[3:15:37] Kisswani: Valanar is the San'lyn dude I think
[3:15:38] mooseliquid: @towelliee are we going to be able to play blood dps on DK?
[3:15:42] Sollice: LOL I KNEW IT!
[3:15:42] P4RT1CLEM4N: What do you think will be the meta tank out of the gate in Dragonflight?
[3:15:53] Sollice: I thought July 14th was a little late for July 4th
[3:16:00] 91Niki: Hahaha
[3:16:00] bob_the_demon: Worrisome that we have only seen the DK and Druid talents
[3:16:20] gimmlay: dont forget theyve been working on this the moment the decided to  not release 9.3. i think they are further ahead than most think
[3:16:23] fcsgamer: @paradoxyy I was expecting a April/may release, so I prefer waiting ofc.
[3:16:26] wyman1990vc: being able to customize your own dragon was really enticing too
[3:16:28] jmalmin: They will nerf the talents as we play along. Nerf them all into the ground like how they nerfed fun abilities in BFA.
[3:16:32] P4RT1CLEM4N: @bob_the_demon I agree
[3:16:35] 91Niki: We’ll be doing a New England road trip. So very little time for online stuff
[3:16:38] heavenphist: it does feel a little worrying to announce 2022 release. noone was expecting it
[3:16:46] Sollice: That sounds fun and very relaxing
[3:16:49] thymos_: @jmalmin or like in mop KEKW
[3:16:57] shroomzy: i think they made a mistake going for 2022 launch, should of let wotlk be nice filler until a early spring / early 2023 launch
[3:16:58] Kisswani: @gimmlay and I would believe that . but it would be great if we could just see the other talent trees , just as screenshots
[3:17:02] paradoxyy: @fcsgamer prolly its around febr/march still, they will delay
[3:17:08] MrGharr: But DF has less "risky" systems that need many player feedback, to redesign.
[3:17:14] Sollice: I think since we are up in Ohio this fall Katie and I are going to take a long weekend in a cabin for my birthday in October
[3:17:19] wEiRdO_dUdE: Yeah, it's a lot of work overall
[3:17:20] 91Niki: @sollice Gonna explore all the caves in New Hampshire
[3:17:26] mavericks312: this maybe blizz's most risky xpac in awhile
[3:17:30] Sollice: Tell Gattz my mother is from Manchester
[3:17:43] Ithylz: I feel like this beta will be more fleshed out when it appears than past betas (think 9.2 1st build)

[3:17:51] bob_the_demon: @gimmlay By the content that we have gotten since 9.1, I HOPE that they have only had a skeleton crew working on SL and pushed everyone else to DF
[3:18:00] Deadelus0: gz
[3:18:06] NewWorldReign: 2
[3:18:08] 91Niki: @sollice the real one or the fake one? Kappa
[3:18:13] wEiRdO_dUdE: 72! Do we need to go back to the class trainer?
[3:18:16] thymos_: old talent system KEKW
[3:18:23] Sollice: Well....I suppose the fake one :P since it's Murica Manchester
[3:18:30] gimmlay: @bob_the_demon i keep hoping the same man. with how bad korthia was, no way they didnt do that.
[3:18:32] 91Niki: @sollice LUL
[3:18:44] NewWorldReign: Two of
[3:18:48] ceranac23: i think alpha will be barbeones
[3:18:59] rxdderz_: would they ever skip alpha and go straight beta?
[3:19:09] Zippaya: no way all that in alpha
[3:19:15] Addy_life: i think they should just send it. no alpha no beta
[3:19:17] wraaith: in the centre of the area
[3:19:19] jmalmin: Is this talent system in wraith before or after the cap? or are you able to make the hybrid builds?
[3:19:21] P4RT1CLEM4N: @gimmlay Korthia was just terrible
[3:19:21] Sollice: You all ever want to come over here we have a spare bedroom. I got a 3 bedroom specifically to have family and friends over
[3:19:29] MrGharr: they would still need focused testing and just not enable everything
[3:19:30] wraaith: the table thing u was at earlyer
[3:19:35] 91Niki: @sollice i recon almost every state in the US has a Manchester. Y’all are such un original copy cats over here
[3:19:44] thymos_: yes bet they will skip alpha
[3:19:45] wEiRdO_dUdE: In the release footage, they had centaurs running around and stuff so the alpha is not going to be too awful
[3:19:51] TheEndIsNear777: !ALPHA
[3:19:51] Moobot: @TheEndIsNear777 PREDICTION JULY 14th | WoW 10.0 Alpha SOON TM: https://www.wowhead.com/news/dragonflight-internal-alpha-now-on-blizzard-catalogue-327322 | Quick reminder there are NO alpha keys! Alpha is invite only. Beta MIGHT have keys. We are a long ways away from Beta.
[3:19:54] Trexxter: the blue shining altar
[3:20:03] wraaith: he knows
[3:20:12] Sollice: @91Niki This is true...NEW York....NEW Jersey...every state probably has 3 or four Londons
[3:20:23] wyman1990vc: @towelliee how did you meet the devs?
[3:20:24] Sollice: NEW Hampshire
[3:20:30] dragothicx: alpha just to test out the new race/class?
[3:20:45] thymos_: make sense
[3:20:47] dragothicx: just like in Legion
[3:20:52] Kriven: alpha more iterative beta is fine tuning and polish for the most part
[3:20:52] wEiRdO_dUdE: And the ducks.....we can not forget that the ducks are ready to go
[3:20:58] 91Niki: @sollice if Ohio wasn’t 14 hours away I’d be all for it haha. We’re only doing a “small” road trip this time around
[3:20:58] wraaith: did ur avengers shield just interupt both targets ?
[3:21:06] zeitgeiz: I thought they would give it the DH treatment. Give us their starting zone only for a while before actual alpha/beta
[3:21:14] Sollice: Listen chat...Who plays Beast Mastery
[3:21:18] Sollice: tell me now
[3:21:24] Torgvaer: Thats not it, go back outside and visit each zigarat
[3:21:24] Subparferal: sup chatters, anyone knows when classic wrathis gonna drop?
[3:21:26] ShadowDMG6969: Why??
[3:21:27] MrGharr: my wife
[3:21:33] wraaith: in wrath no one plays bm lul
[3:21:47] Sollice: Did it get any better after the small buffs a few weeks ago or is everyone still Survival
[3:21:50] ClockworkZen: @Sollice Major Casual reporting in.
[3:21:52] Sollice: Not in Wrath..SL
[3:22:04] Broomba: Saw you play D3 last night! How you enjoying the game and lore? @towelliee

[3:23:08] Bugszy: yep i read that today 600million wow gold to 50k real money
[3:23:10] flebbooo: KEKW funny af
[3:23:24] dragothicx: they don't have a cap how much you can convert? LUL
[3:23:32] Sollice: @Sollice Ok. Last a played a few weeks ago I was full normal geared 4/4 survival and was top dps but I dont really like survival. Wanted to go back BM or play my DH again
[3:23:39] Kisswani: for funding the whole game ? Kappa
[3:23:44] Sollice: @Kriven Oh thats true and much simpler
[3:23:55] R2RHIN0: no man sky explains it all
[3:24:04] wEiRdO_dUdE: You can run BM if you like it, it's alright

[3:31:21] RontheProton: this is when I started WoW. So much nostalgia
[3:31:24] mavericks312: leveling up talents will be all fun but once endgame starts its all meta

[3:32:59] Cavityf: realistically they'll put a lot of your current skills in the talent tree and call them talents
[3:33:01] zastin586: @Towelliee from what I'm reading on wowhead, you can LoS his shadowbolts, so that might help

[3:57:48] grylz89: I think everybody judges a classic community from the first few months of vanilla release. which were awful people, but now years later the community has settled into a more adult vibe
[3:57:49] Vuurvoske426: so you are actually saying
[3:57:52] Jollywhompus: I mean Asmongold use to kinda be a jerk about a lot of things and has openly talked about calming down as he got older

[4:00:28] mavericks312: private server bois are just disgusting creatures
[4:00:36] Jollywhompus: Do you think its the relaxed nature of MMO's that encourage free time to say that stuff in all chat?

[4:51:45] Kuyano: Heyho
[4:51:59] Kulture1: is anyhone on the beta?
[4:51:59] abracka_: slow news day
[4:52:14] Rottencoarse: @Towelliee  true :P
[4:52:20] Korupcija_: wowhead is starving for content KEKW
[4:52:36] wEiRdO_dUdE: A second Death Knight is going!
[4:52:46] Steadmoh190: is this borean tundra
[4:52:50] PepeTheFeelsGoodFrog: Sadge
[4:53:05] Barbarossa85: Question about WOLK. Do I need a level 60 to play with a DK?
[4:53:09] Eithos87: pokemon
[4:53:13] mavericks312: god of war is supposedly in nov
[4:53:21] Putcride: likely
[4:53:22] Velashen: Will this patch allow for blood dps dk? I know it changed over the iterations.
[4:53:29] Kulture1: @Barbarossa85 55
[4:53:33] Neviriah: gosh... if that happens I'll freak out
[4:53:34] Streamcrush: not a lot of big releases this year, mostly good smaller releases
[4:53:36] Colt_Engineer: oooo god of war is pretty good tho
[4:53:37] Neviriah: that'd be bad KEKW
[4:53:42] Streamcrush: next year should be nuts though
[4:53:43] feskstv: anyone knows when lk fresh servers are gonna be up ?
[4:53:54] jasonbriggs: he is in coldarra which is close too borean tundra
[4:53:58] quakegoogl: draRage PartyHat
[4:54:16] Zomgboy: new recruitment GG
[4:54:25] Eithos87: I care about pokemon and REALLY hope dragonflight does not release in nov
[4:54:34] bubonicblade: @feskstv all they've said is "in 2022"
[4:54:40] Chymerical: U think it will be good to play Horde in WOTLK?
[4:54:41] ghost186_: Why are you not playing Death Night?
[4:55:07] taidg_: damn 85 silver for flight
[4:55:23] Steadmoh190: i forgot what dungeon is at that place you just were
[4:55:29] Kulture1: or is it too late?
[4:55:30] ghost186_: Watch wrath come out and 80% is DK
[4:55:34] feskstv: @bubonicblade sadge, i'll stay tuned on wowhead to see
[4:55:49] RagingPunk: 10 seconds ago Kappa
[4:55:56] trashyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy: !alpha af
[4:55:57] Moobot: @Exutara PREDICTION JULY 14th | WoW 10.0 Alpha SOON TM: https://www.wowhead.com/news/dragonflight-internal-alpha-now-on-blizzard-catalogue-327322 | Quick reminder there are NO alpha keys! Alpha is invite only. Beta MIGHT have keys. We are a long ways away from Beta.
[4:56:04] jure__: and not just by a little
[4:56:22] Velashen: @pantelijus cool thanks.
[4:56:26] Kulture1: I think its intentional - people went on about how much they liked the lack of info on the ff release, i think blizzard might be trying something "similar"
[4:56:28] RagingPunk: what do you think of the beta so far?
[4:56:28] Eithos87: if they are releasing dragonflight this year we are behind on the alpha/beta cycle
[4:56:37] feskstv: The microsoft effect lol
[4:56:57] HaxzorJimDuggan: maybe they got their 2nd wind with the microsoft news and gotten use to working from home which has been shown to increase productivty
[4:57:01] StreamElements: Use code POGTOWEL120 for $120 off at https://strms.net/TowellieeFactorMarBot #ad
[4:57:01] NieIas: they have 300 ppl working on the game and they added alot of QA people..
[4:57:12] jasonbriggs: i reckon alpha will be in july then beta in september and release december
[4:57:13] jure__: I really hope this is just to get the hype going and then delay into next year, since these days delays are so common people don't really view it negatively
[4:57:19] belaham: I am going to assume it will be delayed into 2023
[4:57:19] ghost186_: They are trying to drown out shadowlands shittieness. And maybe they belive they have something good with dragon flight. Otherwise they will kill the game
[4:57:38] Destronicus: One theory is that they abandoned Shadowlands early and have been working on Dragon Flight far longer than we think.
[4:57:38] mavericks312: 100% there is a delay
[4:57:40] GermanBacon: Blizzard: "You thought we would announce the DF beta today? SIKE!!! Release is next week!!! No beta this time!!! We doing this shit live!!!" pentawICKED
[4:57:41] JakloomGaming770: i dont hate it. They have a ton of confidence obviously. I also get burnt out researching new content and watching streams etc. I like surprises.
[4:57:49] lettucebereal: @towelliee does Microsoft have any impact on this new cycle of expansions alpha and beta?
[4:57:54] tricky_86: No reason to really doom and gloom until we actually see how far along the game is when Alpha hits.
[4:57:54] Putcride: @Towelliee shadowlands launched in november 2020 so by this november it will hit the two year mark.
[4:58:00] HaxzorJimDuggan: January 24th is my guess
[4:58:01] mavericks312: @lettucebereal no
[4:58:04] NieIas: even Holly said its coming later this year in an interview
[4:58:07] im_your_innerdemon: @Towelliee with wrath and DF this year do you think they will release close to each other?
[4:58:13] Kulture1: there won't be a delay
[4:58:14] notColt45: I thought at the announcement they said don't expect it this year or soemthing to taht
[4:58:16] Azyo1: I feel like they are winging it lol
[4:58:17] feskstv: @Towelliee do you think microsoft has something to it? Maybe they are investing more and hiring more devs to speed the work
[4:58:20] LugzGaming: From the company that replaced women with fruit, turned Arthas into 30 Anima Power, and ruined Sylvanas... is it any surprise they're going to rush out their How I Trained My Dragon expansion?
[4:58:21] skrin001: maybe they have a bigger testing team now and doing alpha in house
[4:58:25] Ralvay: can you give him pala buffs..
[4:58:25] mavericks312: @HaxzorJimDuggan good guess or even early february
[4:58:28] Kisswani: Holly had an interview ?

[4:58:54] Kooznik: @Towelliee what is ur guess the release of Alpha will be?
[4:59:01] NieIas: @Kisswani after the pre orders went live there was a article with some hand picked questions
[4:59:06] dreamnation8818: Good wrath will be the last “vanilla” expansion. How long until they catch up to the latest wow expansion.
[4:59:08] sirbillyy: @Towelliee does honor carry over into wrath?
[4:59:08] quakegoogl: kweistmss draRage PopCorn
[4:59:10] liviu_81: a christmas miracle KappaClaus
[4:59:10] Kooznik: would they skip alpha and go right into beta? or is that not a thing
[4:59:16] Baladore: I mean, there's no crazy changes for DF other than profs and talent tree so, all they had to work on is the zones.
[4:59:18] tricky_86: Alpha July 13th
[4:59:29] JakloomGaming770: lol
[4:59:38] Eithos87: I think them saying it will be released before the end of the year was so they can start the preorders then delay it in nov/dec
[4:59:39] Deadelus0: confirmed: @Towelliee is going to Vegas :-P
[4:59:43] JakloomGaming770: so are you going to vegas?
[5:00:04] sirbillyy: can you click "H"
[5:00:10] Craigtech3825: I’m about to leave for Vegas right now
[5:00:11] mavericks312: @Eithos87 exactly
[5:00:13] Kulture1: maybe he was talking about the release date
[5:00:15] Streamcrush: so basically, get your breaks in because you won't be able to soon, lol
[5:00:16] Kooznik: @Towelliee Would Blizz skip alpha testing and go right into Beta? Or is that not a thing for game companies
[5:00:19] SethLan: Towelliee is in Vegas, that's just a background/green screen
[5:00:27] jerexify: @Towelliee lmao I was about to tag you on Twitter in a post about new, clear, magnetic sneaker storage boxes. Then I saw you commented already.
[5:00:34] LugzGaming: Blizzard is legit dead.They're creatively bankrupt. Thinking Dragonflight will be anything but dogshit means you either have a vested interest because you're a content creator or you're hopelessly addicted to Copium.
[5:00:43] Scusio: alpha definitely before Dec 31st
[5:00:44] DiiscoViking: oh do i miss Wintergrasp
[5:00:59] NieIas: bellular said possible next week? O_o
[5:01:26] Kulture1: @Kooznik ya they could 100% do that
[5:01:40] fbirobertmueller805: Towelie the new Asmongold??

[5:02:04] fbirobertmueller805: 2k viewer Andy over here
[5:02:04] im_your_innerdemon: any idea about wrath release? since they started the beta now?
[5:02:07] reaprwolf: @LugzGaming LOL you idiots have been saying that for 10+ years and have been wrong. This will be no different

[5:03:09] wEiRdO_dUdE: WoWhead having its own Wrath section is awesome
[5:03:33] Kisswani: @PhillyDilly18 no citation needed , I think we all know where they pulled it from
[5:03:46] Gutterm0uth: Northrend HYPE
[5:03:49] PhillyDilly18: @Kisswani Ha! Fair enough

[5:05:32] Steadmoh190: are you planning on doing like a marathon or long stream for dragonflight alpha? @Towelliee
[5:05:50] HauntHogan: @Towelliee do you think it's possible that Dragonflight was an update to Shadowlands that was so large that they decided to make money and turn it into an expansion? which explains it's fast release date
[5:06:06] Kulture1: will you marathon DF?
[5:06:11] Snabido: Thats a burnout
[5:06:15] Snabido: for alpha
[5:06:20] Kulture1: @CastleOscuro no

[5:08:40] krustythaklown: taunka area
[5:08:47] mrsrockguru: you head into the camp by the river you cross and get the next set of quests
[5:08:52] mytherel: north west right? that is part of the tatanka quest
[5:08:52] Kooznik: @Towelliee Im surprised blizz hasnt given us any more talent trees to look at yet? Thoughts?
[5:08:53] bigknapsty: its not the town
[5:09:11] ArmoireKeK: !wotlk
[5:09:11] Moobot: @Psykoticc Plans for WOTLK Beta. Some simple leveling and helping Blizzard test. At first there won't be a lot of people to do content with. That will change when 80 Template comes into play. OH and I don't have Beta keys ask Panda
[5:09:12] Klutar: isn't it the guy on the border
[5:09:15] HauntHogan: @Kisswani yeah dude compare the UI
[5:09:25] Snabido: There's a tiny npc area next to the river after the bridge
[5:09:27] krustythaklown: those 3 tents on the left of the map
[5:09:27] Lothawia: @Towelliee go back to the bridge where he vanished and then turn left
[5:09:35] mrsrockguru: back towards boring tundra on your right as uyou head there
[5:09:38] OhChano: Is anyone going to be playing WoW Classic after WOLTK?  Cata Classic and then MOP Classic? hahaha
[5:09:40] Klutar: yeh back

[5:10:50] justagamingfiend: is this the dumb quest you have to go all the way to venomspite to turn in
[5:10:52] Korupcija_: I heard in 3 hours for sure 💯
[5:10:53] Kisswani: danCopium today for sure
[5:10:55] Klutar: I don't think I like the idea of those Dragonflight talents taking out core abilities like innervate etc and making them talents
[5:11:06] Kulture1: my theory is that blizzard is holding out on purpose so people have the "self-discovery"
[5:11:12] flebbooo: Midsummer in Sweden today Towel, SKÅL
[5:11:21] Klutar: try the camp again
[5:11:23] Klutar: maybe he phased
[5:11:25] Zomgboy: now go north
[5:11:25] Lothawia: to your left on the bridge
[5:11:29] zechetto: @towelliee You might need to abandon and retake
[5:11:31] Snabido: target macro?
[5:11:36] Lothawia: up there
[5:11:45] OnyxLair77: Do you have the DK option in the beta?
[5:11:53] Kisswani: @Klutar you get a talent point each level , so it'll be sort of like gaining innervate at a certain level . that's how I look at it
[5:12:24] HauntHogan: @Kulture1 self discovery lol, I think will go blind doing that.

[5:13:31] j_bar111: the alliance had one at stars rest
[5:13:33] Kisswani: it's the horde garrison area thing
[5:13:33] Klutar: @Kisswani yeh but you could do a build without innervate
[5:13:34] justagamingfiend: all the way to the right is Venomspite that has FP
[5:13:34] flebbooo: There is a horde camp a bit to the right
[5:13:36] j_bar111: idk if that a neutral zone

[5:14:19] Myndjestyr: what is a "yeslawd"
[5:14:27] Klutar: @Kisswani yeah but losing core abilities is just not fun if you don't spec the right way
[5:14:35] HauntHogan: @Towelliee fresh for sure
[5:14:46] frss786: how long is the beta?
[5:14:56] Seoullis: Don't forget to let us know what server :) PvP!
[5:15:18] Lothawia: @Towelliee this is from wowhead When the evacuee stops and points just prior to the last bridge, you need to be fairly close to them or they will despawn and you will have to start the quest over.
[5:15:25] FerociouzMonk: full S3 pvp gear Kappa
[5:15:27] chulklol: 15 min timer buff
[5:15:42] 55burgers55fries: is this the 50% xp buff patch?
[5:15:48] Kisswani: @Klutar I get your point , and there's probably validity for that . but I think they wanted to reduce the amount of "new " talents they have to add
[5:15:55] Gutterm0uth: Is that a Geek Vape?
[5:16:16] frss786: if they are gonna release dragonflight by the end of this year, i think the release date for classic wtk is very close
[5:16:19] Korupcija_: 50% xp doesn't even sound much

[5:16:39] j_bar111: Wrath is when they reduced cast time of mounts?
[5:17:01] wEiRdO_dUdE: 50% exp from all sources and 1/3 exp cut from 61-70, yeah fast
[5:17:10] j_bar111: i heard vanilla doesnt get exp nerfs just 60-70
[5:17:13] Korupcija_: I played on 300% private server and that was even too slow imo :D

[5:58:00] j_bar111: should be on tick
[5:58:00] Thumper1024: @Towelliee I'm really hoping they make 10 man raiding and 25 man raiding give the same loot. what are your thoughts on this?
[5:58:03] tricky_86: I'd rather people buy it from bliz than these fkin botters
[5:58:08] AudioJaq: It’s a way to combat gold buying by bringing it in house- but yeah it’s not the ideal fix, because the problem remains, over inflation.
[5:58:08] Zuhbuumafu: It's on damage tick
[5:58:09] gritbarontv: money is money
[5:58:12] GreenBean59: watch for if the bar turns grey immediately
[5:58:16] HaxzorJimDuggan: he wants to know when it goes grey
[5:58:18] Zuhbuumafu: Not on cast
[5:58:19] GreenBean59: or if its after damage goes off
[5:58:20] wEiRdO_dUdE: He's trying to figure out if his corruption can tag, and I think it can but it takes a tick
[5:58:25] HaxzorJimDuggan: when it applies or when it takes the damage
[5:58:30] GreenBean59: its going to be after the 1 second
[5:58:38] ShowDUH: Of course it will tag it ... the fuck
[5:58:41] stratiss: youre in a party tho
[5:58:43] Zuhbuumafu: For example, curse of weakness won't tag it
[5:58:57] Kisswani: he has to leave party
[5:58:58] GreenBean59: you're still partied
[5:59:00] Zuhbuumafu: It doesn't tag until there's a damage tick.
[5:59:01] HaxzorJimDuggan: yall still a group
[5:59:03] PokerFaceMoose: well heeds needs to not be in group
[5:59:11] stratiss: tell him yes
[5:59:12] PokerFaceMoose: went instantly grey
[5:59:13] Kisswani: yeah tag immediately
[5:59:14] PokerFaceMoose: before dmg
[5:59:14] HaxzorJimDuggan: immediate
[5:59:14] wEiRdO_dUdE: Yep tagged
[5:59:16] ExpectDragons: enough people on the beta to do a TBC raid?
[5:59:18] Relynq: He wants to know if the application of the dot / curse tags a mob. I'm guessing it's only on damage, can't remember if they changed things to tag immediately.
[5:59:21] sniffsc: looks like it tagged on application
[5:59:27] Relynq: Yeah it went grey immediately
[5:59:28] Zomgboy: KEKW
[5:59:31] j_bar111: he tagged with elements
[5:59:35] abracka_: shiddddd warlocks about to dominate leveling then
[5:59:38] Zuhbuumafu: that's broken
[5:59:38] GreenBean59: interesting that he can tag with elements
[5:59:49] Dalinaar: dotted mobs could be stolen from high dot classes.
[5:59:49] Zuhbuumafu: Have him try agony?
[5:59:53] wEiRdO_dUdE: That is nicer for casters, I remember them getting tags stolen

[6:00:04] Zomgboy: taunt does dmg in wrath
[6:00:07] Solarwings: taunt does damage
[6:00:09] j_bar111: taunt did damage
[6:00:10] Miguel85NYC: I thought they got rid of  Ranks in Wrath
[6:00:12] Zuhbuumafu: does damage when not targeted
[6:00:16] Mecabeast: theres going to be griefing with this
[6:00:16] Korupcija_: taunt does dmg wtf PogChamp
[6:00:21] KhaosDryad: taunt does damage if target isnt targeting you
[6:00:27] stratiss: drop seal of command
[6:00:59] stratiss: or whatever the other seal is the yellow one
[6:01:06] pumperDink: tell him to try agony and corruption too
[6:01:07] 55burgers55fries: did they add the 50% xp buff to tbc?
[6:01:17] Dalinaar: My past comment^^^
[6:01:21] FussyQBert: he wants to know if he can run around and just spam curses probably
[6:01:22] j_bar111: He can tag instanltly
[6:01:23] pumperDink: mob tagging for release
[6:01:27] PokerFaceMoose: he wants to see if he can do instant cast and tag all mobs
[6:01:27] Zuhbuumafu: He's trying to figure out how to tag EVERYTHING as quickly as possible
[6:01:27] ShrenTheOrc: mob stealing
[6:01:28] GreenBean59: usually warlocks can't tag mobs instantly
[6:01:34] wEiRdO_dUdE: When you are trying to tag mobs, yeah it helps them to get quests done with a lot of people around
[6:01:36] turbokritisk: its for farm domination
[6:01:51] Necrom93: You used to have to damage a mob to tag it with a dot, now you tag when you apply the dot / curse.
[6:01:51] Hitmanblood: they wanna be scumbags and tag mobs without doing damage so others kill them
[6:01:52] Carnasis: Do you think Dragonflight and WOTLK releasing around the same timeframe is a problem? @towelliee
[6:01:57] Solarwings: true warlocks had to cast and never get tags
[6:02:05] GreenBean59: usually with corruption you have to wait for the damage to tick to tag the mob, so if your'e fighting for mobs corruption sucks, but elements insta tagging is a huge bonus

[6:02:24] Dalinaar: @Hitmanblood Wrong he doesn't want his tagged mob to be stole.
[6:02:27] FussyQBert: it was about that time for tbc and SL right?
[6:02:32] Dalinaar: Take it from a Spriest
[6:02:38] ShrenTheOrc: 7 aids fuk
[6:02:38] stratiss: Dragonblight into Dragonflight
[6:02:41] turbokritisk: in tbc i always had issues with farming if a balance druid are anywhere near cus of their friggin insta tag dot they got
[6:02:45] Dalinaar: Had plenty of mob stolen bc my dot didn't tick in time
[6:02:54] Artivicii: towBolvar
[6:02:59] Dalinaar: Even though my dot applied frits
[6:03:21] Kisswani: I think all the wanted quests are elites
[6:03:39] Hitmanblood: suuuuure. they Def won't be running around tagging everything before warriors and rogues can get to them.

[6:04:10] Zomgboy: this guy is a group quest guy haha
[6:04:22] alvein88: Do I still have time to level ot 70 before WOTLK arrives? I am not super fast at it
[6:04:24] Kisswani: they are all 3 man quests I think
[6:04:24] Klutar: this guy slaps
[6:04:40] Nehcrom: Sure does.
[6:04:59] Hitmanblood: yeah your Def missing like 10k hp
[6:05:01] Nehcrom: Also in this zone isn't there a scarlet crusade outpost?
[6:05:01] sniffsc: I feel this area was always kinda dangerous with all the casters
[6:05:06] Carnasis: @alvein88 Yeah, they are reducing exp from 60-70 by 30% and on top of that they are releasing a +50% exp gain from everything. You’ll have time
[6:05:15] Kisswani: yeah to the north @Nehcrom
[6:05:32] Nehcrom: @Kisswani I think there was a great questline over there, no?
[6:05:33] Kisswani: @Nehcrom wait maybe not to the north but there's one
[6:05:36] NieIas: you think you remember but you dont
[6:05:41] Carnasis: Latest rumor is 4 week preatch
[6:06:10] ExpectDragons: do we get Hand of Reckoning in wrath?
[6:06:27] Nehcrom: It's like south of the NE horde base right?
[6:06:28] Tac2cul2: lost that xp buff

[6:08:06] Connectus: pff, tried to do the weekly mythic dungeon quest and ppl are declining me with 247 ilvl for +0 >_<
[6:08:10] Thumper1024: @Towelliee whats your thoughts on 10 and 25 man raiding having the same loot, if they decide to do it?
[6:08:21] kay0234: Lol, nice!
[6:08:31] Artivicii: True, soon everyone and their mothers will have access
[6:08:37] Kisswani: will they have the same mechanics tho ?
[6:08:37] Nehcrom: Am I the only one that as soon as pre-order for wow hits I buy the most expensive version?
[6:08:38] Diamondead1: @Connectus just make ur own, ull get ppl queing fast
[6:08:38] aleksmetha: hey tow u knew wat df come out this year? before it got announced? ^^
[6:09:06] Maydie6066: @Towelliee are you content with the buffs to Naxx that are planned?
[6:09:08] HaxzorJimDuggan: if i could do 10 man and get 25 man i would be all over it, my tbc guild is currently about 10-15 really good players carrying the others
[6:09:41] Maydie6066: mob health and damage right now, might be more once they open testing on it
[6:10:26] Coleson54: was ulduar hard when it launched?
[6:10:29] notColt45: The mechanics were piss easy so I don't think dmg / hp will do much. Just make it longer
[6:10:30] Kisswani: I think that will be the main attraction doing ICC and Ulduar .

[6:11:07] GreatWhiteDav: because wotlk was when they started to degrade i guess
[6:11:11] notColt45: Two expansions after Classic is weird

[6:11:23] Nehcrom: Had to log in to check! See if any rares are up while I am at it.
[6:11:24] Carnasis: I think the biggest problem with Classic is the gold inflation pricing out players who play legit because it costs 2k+ on Benediction to level engine or JC. Good luck getting shadowmourne unless you’re a guild master or buy gold and GDKP it
[6:11:28] lettucebereal: Microsoft
[6:11:39] MistaHat: @Towelliee Well, IIIIIII Have a problem
[6:11:47] Kisswani: @Nehcrom yep that's the one . I remember a quest to blow up some cannons or something there , with a stealth quest I guess

[6:12:09] MistaHat: @racketpunch RIP
[6:12:10] wynot232: REALLY NO LFG?
[6:12:11] GreatWhiteDav: it's not that they're pushing it more, they're just stopping it from going away - classic and tbc are pretty hard not to play socially
[6:12:11] dormdotz: i think they are afraid non classic fanboys will quit too quickly and if the games to far removed from classic/tbc the fanboys will leave too?
[6:12:21] svennoob: Classic is more social by nature so they didn't have to push it, and then they realized losing the social part is what sorta ruined the game as it went on
[6:12:27] NieIas: no one playing wotlk? release the ripcord and add lfg
[6:12:27] notColt45: It's like okay, where were you in Classic and TBC?
[6:12:28] Carnasis: @racketpunch Install curse client but just the curse client stand-alone not the one with Overwolf

[6:12:46] pumperDink: the last thing classic players want is them making changes. the "hype" casuals might want it, but the people who will be clearing ICC don't
[6:12:54] Kisswani: @Nehcrom played a warlock since tbc so not ideal LUL
[6:13:01] gritbarontv: I think the social stop when people noticed the Xp gain was very small in a group, compare to solo
[6:13:03] prettylaidback1: im getting full just watching him eat that
[6:13:03] zysmos: pr bs imo they're just trying to make classic andys hear what they want

[6:13:41] Carnasis: Naxx buffs kinda just makes pushover content just take longer during the phase that is the best phase for getting your alts ready for Ulduar and beyond...
[6:13:44] dormdotz: i hate arbitrary hp and dmg increases, just forces more meta play
[6:14:04] wynot232: So anyone at blizzard standing up and saying they made that crap decision
[6:14:15] ShadoodHD: they'll put it in later... i know it Keepo

[6:15:54] Kisswani: it differentiated WoW from other MMOs at the time
[6:15:59] Baladore: Yall are reading his comment wrong
[6:16:07] wynot232: nothing you read it wrong
[6:16:10] warrenny: Removing lfg was a mistake in classic
[6:16:11] Aquadriel: he said NO LFG
[6:16:14] ShadoodHD: especially LFR amirite Kappa
[6:16:15] eznotreaal: LFR is so bad but lfg/d is good
[6:16:16] Xugodx2012: #1 being reforging yes? pepehands right? :copium:
[6:16:19] Joostisis: LFG was okay  because if someone quit you'd still remember their name because it was cross-server
[6:16:25] Kisswani: yeah the guy was saying that having no lfg is a bad decision

[6:16:55] MrSlugSnail: towHAMUP
[6:17:01] Aquadriel: i think majority of people who shit on LFR dont even do LFR themselves. but LFR is the second greatest accessibility tool in the game.
[6:17:06] Samiccus: another day another raid
[6:17:08] Kedemel: Hot take: LFR isn't even bad. It was put in for the most casual players to experience raids. If you're not casual, it wasn't necessarily meant for you.
[6:17:14] NieIas: no lfg, no heirlooms, no quest objectives on map, big yikes
[6:17:17] pumperDink: i remember playing wrath, i didn't use a group finder tool, i just queued up
[6:17:19] wynot232: I don't play any classic because it doesn't have lfg  better things to do than sit in chat
[6:17:48] gritbarontv: true, lol
[6:17:54] Hamaculi: fact
[6:17:56] FromCesarWithLove: @Aquadriel Disagree, the decline of WoW started with the first firelands nerf, then after raid finder followed by MOP its never been the same. LFR dumbed the game down

[6:18:12] iCarDog: that's just how games work nowadays. times have changed
[6:18:28] PriddyFresh: I will say, I have social interaction far more in classic tbc than I ever do in retail, and I play both pretty heavily.
[6:18:36] Glynn11: they should know we don't have friends anymore
[6:18:37] NieIas: wotlk--
[6:18:54] YZIOHP: yeah I played wrath when I was a teenager, I aint got time to socialize now
[6:19:10] Klutar: yeah I love it everyone wants the social aspect for classic, then just buy gold so they can afk dungeon boost, then buy gear in gkps at max level, so social
[6:19:13] Aquadriel: yukihiranosoma if you think the decline is because the game got 'dumbed down' then you should be blaming wotlk, which was the major casualisation of the game, as towelliee has said.
[6:19:29] ghost186_: I dont meet anyone, but it is my fault
[6:19:31] Kisswani: I just hope they emphasize the importance of guilds more
[6:19:37] LUKA_THIM: i literally wont play i f i have to socialize
[6:19:47] kevlar9406: yeah and then ban you when the idiots you group with cant perform, so you tell em and then the cry babies report u lol
[6:19:49] j_bar111: I had a couple people added to my friend list while lvling
[6:19:54] Kisswani: I loved in Cata when the whole guild levels were added , made it worth looking for a good guild
[6:20:02] pumperDink: correct, i loved the randomness of it
[6:20:16] j_bar111: Raider io for LFG lol
[6:20:18] Aquadriel: Carnasis but they did that for what m+ dungeons to have on S4, and we got grimrail depot which is going to be a nightmare. Democracy on videogame development is not a good idea.
[6:20:18] kappaday23: Keepo
[6:20:20] Xugodx2012: Blizzard has to realize you cannot force interaction if its not something organic people will be less likely

[6:20:30] mwchaos: theres 100% gonna be a weakaura that shows applicant gearscore and thats all youre gonna go off of and achieves KEKW
[6:20:37] KeidooTV: its going to make causal hard to join teams
[6:20:37] DoubleMcRichy: lova playing on smaller servers. No Gold sellers, next to no boosting and like 1 GDKP raid per week in total. I feel like many problems are caused by having mega servers.

[6:21:01] Kedemel: Yep.
[6:21:03] Barret: same as retail yeah
[6:21:04] warrenny: Group finder is great for m+
[6:21:06] Just_Jaybles: soooo true
[6:21:12] Carnasis: Raider io + gear score is going to make WOTLK Classic get toxic real quick
[6:21:17] HaxzorJimDuggan: just for someone to leave 1 minute into the dungeon because the first pull took 10 seconds longer than it should have
[6:21:18] mwchaos: yuuup
[6:21:19] Klutar: how long before gear score addon is made again lol
[6:21:20] pumperDink: most of the better players will just run with guild only now, that's really bad for new players trying to get into the game
[6:21:23] neugassh: you can get yeeted in lfd as well
[6:21:25] MedicineMan: Facts!
[6:21:28] goosejamss: blizzard simply making it harder for casuals to do endgame content every expansion
[6:21:29] temp3st98: blizzard is soooo out of touch with their community
[6:21:29] Itmyfault69: dungeons were so simple back in the day you could just get 5 joe-shmoes
[6:21:30] peinen: Preach brotha
[6:21:32] GreatWhiteDav: are people going to get declined for farmable stuff that RDF is made for though?
[6:21:38] Kuyano: The "social aspect" happens in the dungeon, not in the lfg
[6:21:42] j_bar111: for a random N/H you dont need to min max

[6:21:42] Doom_Cherry: I HATE raider IO
[6:21:43] Aquadriel: yukihiranosoma i actually did. But making the game accessible is not a bad thing for the future of the game. IF you keep everything 'hardcore' the playerbase will decline and development will not be sustainable because only a handful will experience it.
[6:21:51] Behemyth23: i stopped playing because of raider io
[6:21:51] NieIas: times change blizz..
[6:21:57] neugassh: they vote kick you then instant new player joins
[6:22:00] Korupcija_: honestly they could implement both, for retail too
[6:22:05] temp3st98: imagine being social in a toxic game :)
[6:22:06] notColt45: If they can ban raider io stuff maybe but now I remember that stupid addon LUL
[6:22:11] j_bar111: for a random N/H you dont need to min max. just need 1 tank 1 heal 3 dps thats all
[6:22:15] Carnasis: Yeah raider io made the game super unfriendly to alts, especially when things werent account wide...
[6:22:20] Pigdogx36: what social changes are they making? i missed it
[6:22:25] mwchaos: but LFD is what ruins the social fabric of the community...
[6:22:25] goosejamss: it really seems like blizzard doesn't think about casuals when making decisions
[6:22:38] Nehcrom: Yeah.
[6:22:38] Mecabeast: how was the choice this or chat spam with no inbetween
[6:22:40] Nehcrom: That pit.
[6:22:41] wEiRdO_dUdE: Yes tghe entrance
[6:22:44] unholyorc: this is a not a dk sir
[6:22:53] goosejamss: like they only ask vets who've played this for 1K hours already
[6:22:56] MedicineMan: @Carnasis TRUE!  I have 3k on my healer. I felt the issue when I tried to gear my mage.
[6:23:00] Aquadriel: @Towelliee i wanna guess adding LFG is their plan b, they wanna see how this new verson works and how it evolves during the first month or 2, and then if it goes sour then just activate the true LFG
[6:23:02] WolfMan4500: one thing i want blizz to change and restrict is raider io and gear score from working.  i know gear score is now baked into the game and not an addon.  but really feel thats what led WoW to the toxic path.
[6:23:28] j_bar111: just do heals 4Head
[6:23:41] ColdChillXI: Its great for high tier modes but not all modes
[6:23:58] Carnasis: Great thing about WOTLK though is that almost every class and spec is viable and PvP is the most balanced it ever was.
[6:24:03] Xugodx2012: @j_bar111 Respecs are expensive over time
[6:24:08] neugassh: why would an ele shaman wait for groups LUL its the best for dungeons
[6:24:15] mwchaos: gearscore is a better alternative to "gear check at adal"
[6:24:27] wEiRdO_dUdE: Being non-meta is going to mean longer waits and more hassle to get into groups, yeah
[6:24:33] j_bar111: @Xugodx2012 dual spec comes in wrath but i was mostly joking people should be able to play what they want
[6:24:53] wazza76: Morning Mr. T , happy Friday!
[6:24:58] Exxcar: Wrath baby!! Morning @Towelliee how you doing?
[6:24:59] Carnasis: I think its hilarious that Classic WoW only was able to happen because one ex-employee had source files on a thumb drive LUL
[6:25:04] Xugodx2012: @j_bar111 isnt that mega expensive though since you had to buy it
[6:25:15] Primus21: im worried it wont work well on smaller severs
[6:25:24] NieIas: i wont play wotlk cuz of the lfg change. and i know a few others who wont aswell
[6:25:25] mmrghost7: the bridge intermission of halond mythic is  killing our pretty hard , i cant do anything as a tank D:
[6:25:27] j_bar111: @Xugodx2012 i heard it was 1k but im not sure
[6:25:29] Niksen_99: So they are not adding Dungeon Finder to make the game not too instanced ?
[6:25:34] Gargantix: God I've missed those sound effects lol
[6:25:37] dormdotz: i think a lot of servers will just create there own version of LFG chat
[6:25:40] dormdotz: like a /5
[6:25:40] mwchaos: so true
[6:25:49] Carnasis: Literally just RDF with no cross-server. Simple as.
[6:25:53] Mecabeast: dps specs of tank/heal classes already  had it rough
[6:25:53] Xugodx2012: @j_bar111 1k back then was alot of gold
[6:25:59] tronbadgames: making it inconvenient for that "classic" feel is gonna keep people away for sure
[6:26:15] j_bar111: @Xugodx2012 i agree
[6:26:15] warrenny: Theyll add it by end of classic wrath for sure
[6:26:25] eznotreaal: reese's peanut butter cup and watching streams :)
[6:26:29] Carnasis: I hope we get pre-nerf Yogg zero lights
[6:26:32] wEiRdO_dUdE: Even some of the tanks like warrior tanks are going to have a harder time getting groups because they aren't paladins
[6:26:38] Baladore: Wait too long and it wont matter
[6:26:48] PriddyFresh: I'm gunna be sad having to give up my spell dmg weapons to tank in pre patch.
[6:26:59] sifer007: how Bobby is staying after all the shit he s done?
[6:27:00] propwash80: @Towelliee do you know ppl will make weakauras similar to luxthos for wrath?
[6:27:00] mwchaos: the thing thats odd to me is that they picked wrath to make these big changes to, sitting on a cash cow just had to not mess it up.
[6:27:04] warrenny: Yeah leveling too
[6:27:25] Carnasis: Start needing on the warriors STR weapons in SWP :)
[6:27:32] PriddyFresh: I already have unbreakable will from hyjal, but yeah I need to get a sunwell weapon
[6:27:34] neugassh: people somehow played back then without rdf for a year
[6:27:35] Baladore: @propwash80 lux wont be working on wrath auras, only DF
[6:27:42] Carnasis: They wont need em, nobody wants prot warriors in WOTLK lol
[6:27:43] Behemyth23: what changes are they doing to wrath ?
[6:27:51] Chymerical: Tanks are gonna be in high demand still
[6:27:55] notColt45: What warriors LUL
[6:27:58] ExpectDragons: Think Asmon said he played a Paladin back in Wrath so might do again?
[6:28:00] propwash80: @Baladore do you think ppl will make similar weakauras?
[6:28:05] j_bar111: are warriors easier to lvl in wrath? like 1-60?
[6:28:27] dormdotz: @j_bar111 all lvling will be easier
[6:28:30] Connectus: WotLK release november 2008 and ICC patch came out december 2009
[6:28:33] SpidercowSD: Yeah I had to Post in chat to heal Naxx
[6:28:37] CaarrotTop: you see any other players in game ?
[6:28:39] Connectus: 1 year and 1 month without LFD
[6:28:40] Mecabeast: warriors should be getting their 2hs for titans grip
[6:28:43] shuey23: we need luxthos for wootlk and DF <3
[6:28:47] HaxzorJimDuggan: im sure his deathknight ones will be amazing
[6:28:47] Aimessan: December 9, 2009
[6:28:47] j_bar111: @dormdotz i guess thats true
[6:28:53] Carnasis: Think they should make changes to engineering? @Towelliee
[6:28:53] neugassh: content wise 1/4 of wrath had rdf
[6:28:56] Baladore: @propwash80 there are a few out there I'm sure. I currently dolnt play so no idea.
[6:28:57] DUCK__FOOT: Off topic, unlocking zandalar trolls now is so damn confusing for a new player..
[6:28:59] Korupcija_: you forgot to pick the winner!!
[6:29:16] Connectus: Cata came out december 2010 if I remember correctly, WotLK had LFD for 1 year in total
[6:29:20] eznotreaal: why would you want a weakaura for wrath? @Towelliee
[6:29:35] wEiRdO_dUdE: Oh shit, there's a healer! Grab him!!
[6:29:39] Korupcija_: because weakauras are great
[6:29:49] Carnasis: Weak auras are super useful for snapshotting @berserk21232
[6:30:15] Rottencoarse: @Towelliee  2 more dps sir
[6:30:15] Moobot: 🐲 S4 WILL NOT BE LAUNCHING WITH 9.2.5! It will be here later this Summer probably after the MDI/AWC Finals. 🐲

[6:30:49] tronbadgames: all the beta invitees should just raid around together the whole testing phase
[6:30:55] Carnasis: @berserk21232 For raiding, WAs for blood queen bites is a good example.
[6:30:59] wEiRdO_dUdE: Epic edition winner incoming!
[6:31:08] j_bar111: !wotlk
[6:31:08] Moobot: @j_bar111 Plans for WOTLK Beta. Some simple leveling and helping Blizzard test. At first there won't be a lot of people to do content with. That will change when 80 Template comes into play. OH and I don't have Beta keys ask Panda
[6:31:11] Chymerical: wasnt he tagged as DPS in LFG??
[6:31:22] j_bar111: is there a giveaway going on?

[6:32:07] domiiom98: lok'tar ogar
[6:32:14] PawgersHC: How is prot, first time checking in since beta dropped
[6:32:43] Carnasis: Prot paladins absolutely broken in WOTLK @grittz6690
[6:32:58] Connectus: Wrathgate questline is buggy in this beta build
[6:33:04] alalonso89: just drop the wrathgate quest when you get to it
[6:33:06] Connectus: I would wait with doing it until next build where it's probably fixed
[6:33:10] Rottencoarse: @Towelliee  oh yeah we need the cinematic :D
[6:33:11] gritbarontv: you have to be certain level for that quest
[6:33:12] Korupcija_: doubt they'll enable it 'cause of spoilers
[6:33:25] SpidercowSD: Whats the player count on classic atm im tempted to make a guy but dont know if id be struggling to find groups ect
[6:33:29] kohawk2121: hey Towelliee, Hot take Dragonflight 11/22/22. ive been saying that date since DF was announced and everyone hated. now pre orders out and people are starting to believe. 11/22/22 numbers just work too good to not run a promo around and its a tuesday. Slands launched 11/23.
[6:33:31] domiiom98: concecration
[6:33:39] eznotreaal: blood dk and ass rogue are the best dps
[6:33:44] Tabaron: prot Pally in WoTLK is a beast
[6:33:46] Connectus: @Korupcija_ it's old content, also they mentioned it's bugged but it will be  there
[6:33:46] Carnasis: Agree. They finally have a full kit that matches the RP of a paladin.
[6:33:49] Atroa_: that can be said about almost every single spec
[6:33:54] Atroa_: in wrath
[6:33:57] Connectus: And it will be tested as they need to make sure it works
[6:34:08] Gargantix: holy shield was so good, I was the first prot pala on my server to solo tank saurfang 25 man
[6:34:14] Mecabeast: the faceroll version?
[6:34:23] Carnasis: Crazy how many known bugs there are in the WOTLK Beta. Some of them are pretty whack.
[6:34:24] primetimezhilex: how can you have two seals active? @towelliee
[6:34:27] NieIas: will they keep some TBC servers or will TBC be over
[6:34:31] PawgersHC: do you change seals for aoe vs single target or no?
[6:34:33] goshawklyfe: can i ask  your opinion on fresh servers? will you play  fresh servers?
[6:34:41] Carnasis: @NieIas No plans to keep TBC era servers right now.
[6:34:45] domiiom98: RF?
[6:35:07] tronbadgames: you play on mankrik?

[6:35:20] SamDavidsin: starting lvl 1?
[6:35:31] DeuceDempsey: You gonna stop playing after 80 or you gonna raid?
[6:35:44] domiiom98: no
[6:35:52] Connectus: @Korupcija_ wooshed over my head, tired MingLee
[6:35:53] NieIas: they should keep a few TBC servers per region, otherwise people will complain again in a couple years
[6:35:53] Throdio: Throdio subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 49 months, currently on a 48 month streak! 
[6:35:54] Rottencoarse: @Towelliee  the jumping boss will be pepega tho

[6:36:49] chubahi: i hope we get wotlk soon becoase i want to play it and wait dragonflight :P
[6:36:49] dcaptain1: Has Towelliee commented on what he meant with Wotlk being like a classic plus? did he mean with new group finder and stuff or is there more to come?  Or did i missunderstand?
[6:36:54] Alllprimer: towHAMUP towHAMUP towHAMUP
[6:36:59] DeuceDempsey: Do you think all this drama farming over the dragon flight release date is warranted?
[6:37:14] alalonso89: you have to kill lich king and play the skyrim song when they put the helm like you did way back in the day
[6:37:17] NieIas: @gus_buzz was fake news
[6:37:23] DUCK__FOOT: Off topic, but unlocking zandalar trolls as a new player now is so damn confusing..
[6:37:42] dcaptain1: @NieIas oh, was the clip out of context?
[6:37:48] eznotreaal: my expectations are soo low for the next expac cuz they didnt delay it to make it a big expansion
[6:37:52] Hazno: @Towelliee is dual spec active in the beta atm, or will they release that along with the Ulduar patch like back in the day?
[6:38:04] Hazno: great, thanks!
[6:38:04] PriddyFresh: I remember back in original TBC, for some reason all my achievements for dungeons and raids up to SSC and TK didn't get tracked
[6:38:08] PriddyFresh: I was pretty mad

[6:38:35] Gargantix: you can get that and more just questing to 80
[6:38:38] Tabaron: is the Exp event be available in fresh servers?

[6:43:45] Carnasis: @Connectus Just like a DK should be haha
[6:43:58] ErkTheMighty: probably meant 15-25
[6:44:10] Exxcar: That's one of the things people did a lot with Wrath private servers. They would have "fun" servers that went to 255
[6:44:13] notColt45: YEP remember that LUL
[6:44:38] Connectus: @Carnasis MingLee
[6:44:40] NieIas: yea maybe theyre using some private server source code lol
[6:44:56] ErosnPsyche: only level 72? :O
[6:44:57] abracka_: i feel like we're slowly approaching that
[6:45:01] Menion01: They can't even balance 60 levels little lone 255.
[6:45:13] Exxcar: There are a lot of them
[6:45:14] warrenny: Shouldve gone that way in df

[6:45:30] iCarDog: man sometimes I kinda wish I stuck with ESO. they had some cool systems
[6:45:32] Carnasis: I wanna play fresh so badly but doubt i can get friends that are new to the game to do the grind...
[6:45:51] Korupcija_: anyone played on wowscape like 15 years ago, that was the shit
[6:46:02] NieIas: 255 is a bit sus cuz there are private servers that use that lol
[6:46:16] Berksgorh: same if eso bag wasnt so annoying , i would keep playin it too xD
