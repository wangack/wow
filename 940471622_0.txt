[1:56:39] CritcobainTV: I fucking loved when I got geared in wrath, and all the little casuals would be like "damn dude nice gear" and i was just like "WORSHIP ME PEASANTS"

[1:56:48] CritcobainTV: KEKW
[1:56:59] George2001k: @towelliee do you think Blizz will/should make a raider io system like they adopted gear score with ilvl?

[1:57:39] swordwindgaming: imagine every raider io page has a feedback section
[1:57:43] CritcobainTV: All the people that think raider io ruined the game are just the people who dont do any content LUL
[1:57:56] Superman_KalEl: but yeah the pandemic certainly hasnt helped the development of the game, especially with what was shown at blizzconline
[1:58:02] PacioliNB: minus that whole hall of fame

[1:58:48] guardanapkins: May i know what's the weak aura on the top left of the screen?
[1:58:50] Shrenko: that would be great
[1:58:52] George2001k: Raider IO ain’t going anywhere so might as well put some...since in it...
[1:58:55] swordwindgaming: Thats because Squeenix doesn't want streamers to get harassment mobs on people

[2:04:50] majorizc: what if 9.1 is the worst patch ever?
[2:04:55] smashwow: maybe they'll fix the ilvl thing for valor and the retro gear on release.
[2:05:27] SonofHorus82: I have already more or less written this xpac off. I dont raid or do mythic dungeons, but I'll play the new patches up to a certain point to experience the new content. More hyped for TBC than anything else right now.
[2:06:44] CritcobainTV: same. my rogue literally only needs valor for Phial of putrefication
[2:06:49] Keyastaron_: @pignapugna  its 9.0.5 not 9.1

[2:08:33] lithium364: only if it comes out in 10 month LUL
[2:08:47] mavericks312: if they were in the office i think 9.1 would be in may
[2:08:54] Keyastaron_: @Towelliee  the items go back 17 days for ite, restoration
[2:09:14] MrEvilRex: their technical issue could be different depending on each system, corruption armor system could be a different system to Legion's artefact power system from a technical point of view
[2:09:19] Roadskii: People are in such a hurry for content, content, content...relax and enjoy the damn game a llittle

[2:09:42] Keyastaron_: @Towelliee  intended release was october?
[2:10:05] Alegnowar: do u think shadowlands will have as many raids as legion and bfa got or u think they gonna cut it short?
[2:10:39] CardinalTX: Why arent they back in the office......cant stay covid safe distance where they work?
[2:10:40] Phoxzy: I love the semantics of that description.  Sylvanas is the fateful last encounter / confrontation of the raid.  But there hasn’t been one description that has truly called her the final boss of the raid.

[2:33:11] Shurn_82: and gems forces people to take JC  so whats the point of that arguement
[2:33:28] MuttonChopins: why not just drums buff last for 1 hour
[2:33:45] Holysal: @shurn_82 and same for ring enchants
[2:34:02] Zarinna2015: You actually can get rid of it. It is the creme de la creme because of what it has equivalent in any other class, which is why it is the creme de la creme and so unique.
[2:34:02] myguyhood: gems are tradeable
[2:34:17] theplesh: why did you guys pick Azuresong Horde?
[2:34:25] MuttonChopins: gems were fun back then

[2:35:31] SonofHorus82: @theplesh Azuresong isnt a high pop realm and it's skewed to the alliance so it's easier for us to get around with the things we need, and hopefully we can try to even out the server pop.

[2:42:28] Wildside1177: It is a subjective list
[2:42:29] lumaday: seemed more on his personal experience with the raids
[2:42:33] Hybridwarhawk: I think it was more of a nostalgic trip list than what most perceive to be the goods and bads
[2:42:34] pavepawns: like onyxia is 10th of 44raid
[2:42:45] Zansteh: react stream Pog

[7:32:16] KizaruGR: Please remind me, you transfer from Classic to BC or BC to classic?
[7:32:18] Dauraane: @Towelliee the reason ur feral abilities update automatically is b/c their costs dont change with rank. so u dont have multiple spells. only 1 spell at the new rank since the dmg is all that goes up
[7:32:36] Shrenko: ???
[7:32:40] KizaruGR: Ah, okay
[7:32:47] shocky_324: they took the rank requirement away in prepatch. just needed honor and bg marks to get the pvp gear
