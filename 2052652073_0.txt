[2:25:27] Anhak: and there is a highlight called "till 300 iq"
[2:25:48] wEiRdO_dUdE: Just go to the Warcraft channel on Twitch, click videos then the top left one in the main section of videos
[2:26:34] wEiRdO_dUdE: It would be the one that says 12 hours ago
[2:26:46] Anhak: 2 hours 33 min roughly is the start of the liquid match of the day

[2:35:08] healhut: i did it once. once was enough
[2:35:14] Anhak: its kinda sucks when its hot out you burn your head when its cold out you miss that hair for warmth its just all around less ideal
[2:35:18] EFFSIN: could be just brain
[2:35:36] dawsonator171: you could shave head or dye hair blue. both are bad. Kappa
[2:35:46] Anhak: daws
[2:35:51] Anhak: you got less then a week to get 25
[2:35:54] Anhak: pick it up
[2:36:08] Anhak: thursday is new phase
[2:36:39] Anhak: noon est i think? not exactly sure but i think its noon est or pst when its announced i have 18 of 20 quest prequested
[2:37:08] nikthevoker: do you have the pre quest google doc LUL
[2:37:14] Anhak: no nik
[2:37:20] Anhak: i did quest for gold and stuff
[2:37:24] Anhak: so even if i did
[2:37:30] nikthevoker: the best quests and all quests that are items you use instead of quest space
[2:37:42] nikthevoker: its so funny
[2:38:14] Anhak: altho a certain someone owes me 25 gold before thursday *cough* Ave *cough*
[2:39:20] Anhak: nik you gonna pvp tuesday wed? get some honor before the reset EZ Clap?
[2:40:38] Anhak: Also i find it really funny RN rogues are freaking out over 40 energy mutilate (it will be insane LATER ) but its only 3 dps better then backstab at 40 assuming mech types
[2:43:09] Anhak: thats a buff from 60 to 40 but we are assuming RN that atleast 5 of 6 bosses are mech which is bleed and poison immune
[2:43:59] Anhak: they could do like they did with akumi or w.e the last boss of bfd is and it was beast but in sod he is uncatagorized
[2:44:58] dawsonator171: chuck is digging himself a hole.
[2:44:58] Moobot: Tshirts, hoodies, and mugs available now! https://merch.streamelements.com/notmes
[2:45:21] Anhak: Chuck is yes lol
[2:45:42] Anhak: i think we see 1-2 mech bosses but maybe atleast 3 non mech
[2:45:54] Anhak: its still awkward cause non mech we actually want different talents then mech bosses
[2:46:18] dawsonator171: fucks with feral hard.
[2:46:27] Anhak: ferals bleeds are shit
[2:46:31] Anhak: in classic feral is fine
[2:46:47] Anhak: unironicly like 100 dps loss for warrio and like 150ish rogue
[2:47:14] Anhak: warriors are simming almost 900 dps vs non mech at 40 KEKW
[2:47:42] americanmoses18: the man donated 10 thousand dollars?
[2:47:45] americanmoses18: fucking hell

[2:49:44] nikthevoker: so its left middle right LUL
[2:49:50] Anhak: feral has 2 really sick weps this phase a new MCP with 3 min cd instead of 3 uses no cd but way more stats including 69 Fap then there is the pvp wep which is 80 Fap roughly the same str and agi + 3 min cd 30 seconds active 5 damage added to every melee + it cleaves 5 targets
[2:50:53] nikthevoker: he needs a racing stripe
[2:50:57] nikthevoker: down his stache

[6:11:37] dawsonator171: or is it that over rated?
[6:11:47] xDroozyy: someone on CML did
[6:11:52] engaldk: I kinda think that if they queued TSG into Splay it wouldve been better no?
[6:12:17] Shablagoosh: maybe a stupid question but do ven and supa and eiya get paid or are they doing it for exposure?
[6:13:03] dawsonator171: they are contracted yes.
[6:13:28] engaldk: Do you know how much vers% he plays?
[6:13:47] engaldk: dont you just get more damage by going 30% vers?
[6:13:53] engaldk: cause of overcap on other stats?
[6:14:03] majorpipoo: 35pvp stat or pve stat ? @notmes

[6:14:50] jacob_the_mage: Do you rune emp rune weapon usually as unholy mes?
[6:14:53] jacob_the_mage: run*
[6:15:59] engaldk: I think mastery embesh feels kinda bad with that low vers no?
[6:16:22] dankgamer97: What's up with being panda ? Orc would have been better no?
[6:16:26] engaldk: the thing is on my fdk I dont really mind my haste
[6:16:29] engaldk: Im on like 11%
[6:16:30] engaldk: I can check rq
[6:16:41] engaldk: @dankgamer97 Panda incap/and 1% vers from food
[6:16:42] dankgamer97: Think they all were panda
[6:16:54] yourKnightmaare: would sporecloak be useful for frost?
[6:17:04] engaldk: @yourKnightmaare its ass
[6:17:05] engaldk: imo
[6:17:19] jacob_the_mage: I feel like dev would have been a better pick for that comp
[6:17:23] jacob_the_mage: instead of running ww
[6:17:40] engaldk: @jacob_the_mage Splay has to much stuff vs dragon
[6:17:45] dawsonator171: chillstreak disappeared into the void.
[6:17:46] engaldk: SP/Rsham make it really rough for dragon
[6:17:51] yourKnightmaare: @engaldk I see some people running it still.
[6:18:17] engaldk: On my FDK im running 86% Mastery 31% vers and 10% haste
[6:18:17] Shablagoosh: sporecloak is like a 80k shield or something
[6:18:21] Shablagoosh: 88k maybe
[6:18:44] Colaja953: borpaSpin
[6:20:10] complexified: trink swap

[6:20:27] yourKnightmaare: @engaldk how does that feel with 10% haste?
[6:20:28] Axtin: pika has disarm for dk
[6:20:53] engaldk: @yourKnightmaare its rough ive been thinking to go abit more haste
[6:21:11] yourKnightmaare: yeah I can't imagine that feeling good haha @engaldk
[6:21:39] chamboulos: who won this?
[6:22:05] engaldk: Idk why they took images btw
[6:22:12] engaldk: They have fear/earthen
[6:22:20] engaldk: 1.5
[6:22:25] engaldk: I also play images in TWD with my WW
[6:22:31] engaldk: but into SP/Rsham it feels really bad
[6:22:38] shugguls: 1 should line up with sweep each time
[6:22:48] dankgamer97: Have they played anything else other then RPS in this awc ?
[6:22:49] yourKnightmaare: it also probably doesn't feel like a total loss with fdk dam as well as ww dam
[6:22:59] Shablagoosh: i always forget burrow is a thing lol
[6:23:22] complexified: 1 more crit he woulda ddied
[6:23:36] engaldk: Earthgrab totem is really buggy
[6:23:42] engaldk: it works like ticks, not how long you stood in it
[6:23:45] engaldk: its in ticks
[6:23:54] engaldk: thats what I realised on my rsham
[6:23:58] isseswagger: damn hes doing half dam
[6:24:09] Shablagoosh: woa yea that makes sense
[6:24:17] Shablagoosh: if he didnt hit anything at all he woulda won
[6:24:27] engaldk: I think you just Q TSG into that tho no Mes?
[6:24:35] engaldk: Like Warrior will rail road the SP the entire game or not?

[6:58:13] jacob_the_mage: In that case, I can't believe it's not buddha
[6:58:22] yourKnightmaare: it's actually so sick you can mog Frostmourne on TR
[6:58:38] happyheals: in Hawaii people said Bruddah or Buddah for friends and generic for buddy

[7:00:30] happyheals: It would suck to still be going to school
[7:00:34] tmk1t: graduate school is totally different
[7:00:37] tmk1t: than regular college
[7:00:41] happyheals: Yeah
[7:01:01] tmk1t: well, it totally depends on the type of graduate school
[7:01:09] tmk1t: in my med school, we had an exam almost every week
[7:01:11] Shablagoosh: How does something like that work for their sponsors?
[7:01:21] ordnung99999: uh this game the monk died yesterday 3 times with insi and cocoon rdy or
[7:01:26] tmk1t: my brotherâ€™s law school- some classes had regular tests, some only had one exam at the end.
[7:01:35] Vigi9413: itâ€™s like ww/dk never stood a chance
[7:01:37] Shablagoosh: werent they method?
[7:01:38] Msv2: Do you think Xeek had a global to kill the static?
[7:01:39] Shablagoosh: for a while
[7:01:45] happyheals: I did my graduate studies at UCF and it is well over 100 hours of studying a week alone
[7:01:55] happyheals: you get below an 85 and you fail
[7:02:02] Roseqt: in Puerto Rico you get June July with no classes.(no school. "summer" but the weather never changes year around.
[7:03:12] Roseqt: LMFAO awesome clipboard diagrams
[7:03:27] Roseqt: easy to understand
[7:04:02] Shablagoosh: i feel like spriest is always so easy to over or undertune
[7:04:50] Vigi9413: so theyâ€™re go is 12 seconds and then wait what does the moves look like
[7:05:15] Roseqt: The Move = ... i always think of JEllybeans.
[7:05:49] eEpzi: tbh i respect them for bringing up sp
[7:06:51] Vigi9413: so basically they have a longer chance to go vs ww/dk thereâ€™s really nothing they can do if they live

[7:32:09] yourKnightmaare: mes, question. with plater. how do I keep the importance pink color totems with an icon above them? and how do I remove bm/demo pets?
[7:33:24] doomcute: I wonder If they removed 2nd vanish for sub and defs cdr for outlaw would they still be better than assa
[7:33:50] yourKnightmaare: yeah I will snag your new one. but I just liked that your old one had pink nameplates for important totems and like a different color for observer
[7:33:59] rembrandt89: wiz called the ww sub team evil an never wants to fight it LUL
[7:34:08] happyheals: you can edit it
