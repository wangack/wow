[0:08:50] Innerverse: DH NERFS?
[0:09:14] foxyllama: u wont notice it
[0:09:15] Saitistreamy: not enough at all
[0:09:17] mneYEP: i dont think its enough
[0:09:18] Smexxin: last 2 should be big
[0:09:22] dismantlle: 2% increased dmg taken isnt that much for unkillable class xdd
[0:09:26] foxyllama: i think small changes is BIS
[0:09:28] foxyllama: this is how u should tune
[0:09:31] nikthevoker: its like the ret rework, small nerfs til you notice it
[0:09:41] ramongrizzly: If they die in 1 less global it's a win
[0:09:42] buffevoker: Hell no you need to tune them to the GROUND
[0:09:47] Gleds: Think theyve tried to make the squishier but left their damage the same..
[0:09:47] foxyllama: i think this is how actually tune, i love it
[0:09:51] foxyllama: i dont want dh bad i want it good
[0:09:57] freelofear: small changes are bis, if they actually have changes more often
[0:09:59] foxyllama: LMFAOAOAOAOAO
[0:10:13] Saitistreamy: if they do more then sure
[0:10:15] Magottx: Shitting out random glaives for 100k nerf will be so nice
[0:10:19] Saitistreamy: if they dont then wtf
[0:10:27] pharmztko: DH unplayable
[0:10:28] mneYEP: smalls changes so it takes 6 months to bring outliers in line.. totally
[0:10:31] foxyllama: only thing we need is acidrain buff 400% in pvp
[0:10:37] Magottx: Still S tier for sure.
[0:10:57] drdoomkinx: 20% hp to 32%
[0:11:04] Smexxin: true @foxyllama
[0:11:12] foxyllama: lmao
[0:11:14] lfud: feral needs dmg buff after this change tho
[0:11:57] Xeliumimar: Ieatmages licks fingers

[0:13:33] galdinator: Living Bomb Pog
[0:13:44] mneYEP: interesting
[0:13:55] blueberrypieface: LUL
[0:14:01] freelofear: no lmao
[0:14:08] setbackttv: Next living bomb pass, increased by 1400%
[0:14:14] ChilledsDogTreats: nah lolol, still passing on it
[0:14:16] mneYEP: trying to make it possible to not spec cannon maybe
[0:14:18] Smexxin: should be p good in bgs
[0:14:23] Gleds: Pets take less aoe damage though
[0:14:23] dismantlle: why dont they just buff base dmg of the ability instead of these 800% increases?
[0:14:26] Saitistreamy: how much does it do currently?
[0:14:43] foxyllama: I NEED THEM TO DELETE FW
[0:14:44] setbackttv: like 30-40k on a 30 cd
[0:14:51] Xeliumimar: funny how r sham isnt nerfed
[0:14:53] setbackttv: but you gotta give up big talents for it
[0:15:20] blueberrypieface: Crusader himself made those changes
[0:15:21] buffevoker: Big Dam Judge IS BACK
[0:15:40] blueberrypieface: ONESHOTTING him
[0:15:52] Gleds: Judgement still costs a lot of mana though
[0:16:00] foxyllama: i think smite hits for 15k?
[0:16:02] foxyllama: am i wrong
[0:16:06] setbackttv: @venruki I don't see anyone going meteor build path even with a 30% buff. Everything you gotta drop to get it won't happen
[0:16:17] walokki: 5% icelance dmg frost gonna be so op
[0:16:27] mneYEP: mw changes seem kinda crazy
[0:16:29] setbackttv: COULD be wrong, maybe pherix will come out with deep impact meteor and show us the way
[0:16:34] ChilledsDogTreats: Outlaw got slapped on the wrist
[0:16:38] dismantlle: ah yes the sam rogue
[0:16:49] CabinetMistake: reduces cd on evasion i think?
[0:17:02] MaybeRespect: At least Mes is off bench now...right? Kappa
[0:17:11] Gleds: @dismantlle Sam benefits from Trills pvp talent..
[0:18:22] walokki: frost mage use no set in pvp
[0:18:54] dismantlle: @Gleds mb
[0:19:07] galdinator: execute monkaS
[0:19:12] sneedyz: really boring 2 months for 2% changes
[0:19:14] TheKidRobin: i think reasonable changes
[0:19:17] Gleds: Yes, WW monk was left alone xD
[0:19:20] Nethylol: They feel a bit mild considering how long we waited
[0:19:23] bibitooo: The DK changes were great
[0:19:24] buffnac: surv dmg def excites me
[0:19:24] TheKidRobin: im happy about living bomb tbh, there's hope! lol
[0:19:25] buffevoker: More evoker buffs needed
[0:19:35] MaybeRespect: @bibitooo Biggest joke of a class overall.
[0:19:40] Yukimes: enhance needs more than healing surge buff :(
[0:19:40] KerrbyWoW: ❤️
[0:19:41] Lamatastisch: No DK changes Sadge
[0:19:47] Saitistreamy: more buffs to unpopular specs
[0:20:00] Gleds: DKs had their time.
[0:20:00] stealthwalker99: I wanted fw deleted
[0:20:00] KerrbyWoW: <3
[0:20:00] pharmztko: DK LUL
[0:20:09] MaybeRespect: @Gleds In wrath?
[0:20:10] lfud: feral got more nerfed than buffed
[0:20:11] foxyllama: i wanted to see fw healing -90%
[0:20:15] phanabananana: yeah get rid of fisters
[0:20:16] Saitistreamy: aff augmentation could use some love it seems
[0:20:28] Saitistreamy: FW needed a nerf in pvp
[0:20:32] Scabbyx: i think all the changes does not really change anything noticable at all
[0:20:35] dismantlle: dsetro nerfs were pretty big right?
[0:20:36] buffevoker: I do
[0:20:37] Smexxin: do we feel like dk is bad? they seem p good right now still
[0:20:44] Gleds: Aug ruined season 2
[0:20:44] laalaaland22: i dont
[0:20:46] ChilledsDogTreats: I wish Aug didn't exist in it's form at all.
[0:20:48] Shirolol: I miss aug burst :(
[0:20:50] Yukimes: enhance needs a rework   its basiclly a bad version of ele
[0:20:54] ChilledsDogTreats: should have just  been a dps
[0:20:56] Saitistreamy: if they make support classes like tanks for PVP thats a bad long term thing
[0:21:07] phanabananana: i disagree feels worse for rets
[0:21:21] foxyllama: dude i hate rets,they always blame their own class
[0:21:23] phanabananana: lol
[0:21:23] foxyllama: its so annoying
[0:21:24] Bicataa: BM buff is nonexistent ....
[0:21:27] MaybeRespect: Dk feels stinky vs. everything atm. Idk what it feels good into
[0:21:27] foxyllama: ret players are actually the most annoying
[0:21:29] supatease: supatease subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 62 months! 
[0:21:36] Shores2424: so true
[0:21:50] buffevoker: Rets are the ultimate victim class LUL
[0:21:57] Saitistreamy: truth
[0:21:58] foxyllama: they smoke so much copium its insane
[0:21:59] stealthwalker99: It’s the fw aoe healing that needed to go it’s toxic vs some classes but not others
[0:22:01] phanabananana: im not a ret
[0:22:04] cajovysacok: foxy stop tipeing and go stream Kappa
[0:22:18] Nethylol: There's a lot of melee that are completely fine but are just overshadowed by dh
[0:22:26] Saitistreamy: FW is rage inducing as SP
[0:22:32] supatease: Vengeful retreat immune my cast, stunned my cast, incapped my cast, feared my cast, dr stunned my cast, kicked my cast repeat
[0:22:43] Panaxx: wish we saw a nerf to cleansed by flame
[0:22:53] Saitistreamy: test living bomb yo
[0:22:56] Nethylol: The biggest issue with fw and mw is that they are the same spec, so mw buffs accidentally buff fw, wish they'd give them the guardian druid experience and make it 2 seperate specs
[0:23:02] MaybeRespect: What about Impish Instincts lol
[0:23:19] Gleds: whats cleanse by flame?
[0:23:25] dismantlle: @venruki lock got hit hardest by nerfs right?
[0:23:39] supatease: Is this ptr
[0:23:40] masterkain: nowadays we don't take a fire inside so cleanse by flame is less effective
[0:23:40] mneYEP: @Gleds dispel self with immo
[0:23:41] Saitistreamy: impishi instinicts is good design, it encourages you to not just train 1 target
[0:24:00] Gleds: Oh, yeah that wild
[0:24:09] waflezmonk: waflezmonk subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 48 months! 
[0:25:08] Blumee9: Thoughts on survival buffs? gonna be s tier now?
[0:25:09] kiriuped: Pretty negligible of a buff
[0:25:17] Saitistreamy: how much will living bomb be?
[0:25:18] kiriuped: frost ones i mean
[0:25:37] Magottx: Ok so nothing crazy but nice for sure
[0:25:37] mneYEP: @Blumee9 damn wasnt surv's issue, already cranks

[0:26:10] imitatewater: @venruki i swear i think destro nerfs are bigger than dh nerfs they got off so easily man
[0:26:27] BigDamJudgeGitFukd: should demon hunter death sweep really be hitting for 400k? just had two dhs do 2 million dmg in about 2 seconds its insane
[0:26:38] Blumee9: @mneYEP Maybe, but its a pretty huge buff, so might still do a lot
[0:26:41] Snohconez: yeah unforch DH will be the meta the rest of s3
[0:26:45] Saitistreamy: DH nerfs are that they dont know exactly how to nerf them
[0:26:54] Saitistreamy: destro is they have 1 thing too good
[0:26:59] mneYEP: @Blumee9 yea maybe!
[0:27:07] Schmidtrs12: sorry can i see where the DH "nerf" is explained? or would you mind talking thru it again cheer100
[0:27:08] blueberrypieface: It makes me wonder how many more bugs like that are present
[0:27:17] Shores2424: what’s the bug?
[0:27:19] imitatewater: @venruki opinion on enha buffs? those healing surges will be huge
[0:27:29] Magottx: 15$ a month from every player btw
[0:27:30] nikthevoker: holy shit elo hell is mindblowing
[0:27:36] DecocoTv: When do those hit live?
[0:27:39] magebrainx: DH buffs seem underwhelming. like pathetically underwhelming
[0:27:53] magebrainx: nerfs*
[0:28:02] G0AT_Mahomes: what patch are we talking about?
[0:28:07] Blumee9: buff sub rogue! xd
[0:28:08] exreplays: I think the nerfs are fine I think ppl just hate dh and wanted it to get giga nerfed lmao
[0:28:11] hailseitan: will destro be ok?
[0:28:11] Runfatboy: Go enjoy feral
[0:28:20] Snohconez: they will still die to air
[0:28:20] dismantlle: surprised to see we didnt get any dh buffs... only nerfs
[0:28:29] Magottx: You on sub and survival is so fun
[0:28:30] imitatewater: @venruki im happy casted mw got some love but i still think its not enough for them
[0:28:44] Saitistreamy: we are going to enter a deep melee cleave meta
[0:28:50] Saitistreamy: the destro dhs will be gone
[0:28:53] Saitistreamy: and cleaves will rise
[0:28:53] Shores2424: what’s the dh bug?
[0:28:55] mneYEP: yea you have to positionally and defensively on it to make that spec work imo
[0:29:06] exreplays: frost mage buffs are good?
[0:29:15] imitatewater: @Saitistreamy devastation stonks will rise they are so good vs melee's
[0:29:17] jporter_: frost demo will be good
[0:29:26] nonamebomjx: i wanna more buffs for frostbolt
[0:29:26] exreplays: if there’s a lot of melee cleaves demo frost might dominate
[0:29:26] magebrainx: living bomb will still do no damage you heard it here first
[0:29:27] nonamebomjx: :(
[0:29:35] magebrainx: 100k crit max on living bomb i think
[0:29:48] Shores2424: when do the changes go into place?
[0:29:50] setbackttv: @venruki Firefall meteor build with living bomb xd
[0:29:56] Magottx: Why do some survivals play melee range and other never get close
[0:30:03] Blumee9: Nothing more annoying to face than frost/demo...
[0:30:05] phanabananana: I just looked through all your toons, your ret is the only negative win loss you got lol
[0:30:09] setbackttv: firefall for free meteors!
[0:30:12] phanabananana: i think you believe its better then it is
[0:30:19] Saitistreamy: @imitatewater stonks?
[0:30:30] Magottx: Gross
[0:30:39] imitatewater: @Saitistreamy stocks i
[0:30:40] Slayer_Eagleone: lul

[0:31:20] Saitistreamy: top 1k is 2.4 +
[0:31:25] buffevoker: But they suck
[0:31:27] buffevoker: LUL
[0:31:37] phanabananana: Per capita would be much better then using a useless overall stat
[0:31:48] foxyllama: WAIT ARE U TELLING ME IF DH IS SUPER NERFED WE ARE ENTERING A RET META?
[0:31:55] Falcanus: enh getting 25% healing surge buff is a slap in the face
[0:31:55] phanabananana: Oh so ret is better then outlaw
[0:31:56] Moobot: Latest video "Cheating In WoW PvP Is Getting Out Of Control" view it here: youtu.be/jhygeA6tFu4
[0:32:06] phanabananana: More people enjoy playing ret
[0:32:14] magebrainx: phanabananana youre delusional
[0:32:18] Saitistreamy: @foxyllama rise of the FW Ret Arms meta
[0:32:25] foxyllama: every ret paladin is delusional
[0:32:28] imitatewater: @venruki i was hoping they anounced an mmr injection or something :(
[0:32:32] foxyllama: its insane
[0:32:33] Sosatko: Ret pally riot inc
[0:32:35] Slandii: just got smoked by a ret lol, theyre so good
[0:32:45] dismantlle: must be a lot of ret players when so many make it to 2700 on negative wr
[0:32:57] exreplays: ret is good but offhealing is useless which makes class fantasy seem weird
[0:33:02] exreplays: gigadam tho
[0:33:05] Blumee9: What do you think of sub rn after playing it?
[0:33:10] magebrainx: exreplays try playing a feral druid then lololol
[0:33:14] Saitistreamy: ret paladin class fantasy is a unstopable god
[0:33:29] blackvpnv: because eu is harder
[0:33:35] Saitistreamy: MY mains class fantasy is free r1
[0:33:42] magebrainx: feral's off healing has been nonexistent sinc SL
[0:33:46] blackvpnv: there is many ret main
[0:33:49] Slayer_Eagleone: EU IS HARDER LULW
[0:33:53] buffevoker: We had alot of ret mains in 10.17
[0:34:04] Axtin: ret is very good
[0:34:06] Blumee9: No sub answer? xd
[0:34:11] Slayer_Eagleone: TRUE THAT
[0:34:13] walokki: Crusader cant get 2.2 in SS  in EU
[0:34:27] nonamebomjx: we have only 1 good ret on eu its a squarlet
[0:34:50] phanabananana: Alll playing 1 comp
[0:34:53] younotmytwin: @walokki but he can get glad in actual 3s in eu?
[0:35:17] buffevoker: @walokki I 6-0d crusader today LUL
[0:35:19] Blumee9: So what did you think about sub?
[0:35:26] Sideshift: !playlist
[0:35:26] Nightbot: Venruki's Spotify playlists can be found at https://open.spotify.com/user/1282291530 SeemsGood
[0:35:27] magebrainx: RMX 4eva
[0:35:35] cajovysacok: at list they could buff ret dmg
[0:35:46] Slandii: outside of DH of course, what do you think is the most versatile SS spec?
[0:36:01] Magottx: I vote warrior @slandii
[0:36:13] blackvpnv: destro
[0:36:16] Magottx: Or destro
[0:36:19] Magottx: Yea
[0:36:26] Lamatastisch: WHat about demo?
[0:36:50] jonathan_mop: I play ret and prot. You click like three buttons and do like 200k dps.
[0:36:53] nightmxz: Can you go fire and scorch a player really quick?
[0:36:54] Lamatastisch: ye thats for sure but overall I think demo is "up" there
[0:37:00] nightmxz: I'm not home so I can't do it myself
[0:37:21] phanabananana: ret healing should just be castable and on par with other specs thats all. if you have to run you should be able to somewhat heal at least 25%
[0:37:38] foxyllama: omg silence this man
[0:37:42] Axtin: ret healing is castable
[0:37:45] cajovysacok: would be nice if ret would get  20-30 % increse dmg on templar verdict that thing hit so bad
[0:37:47] nightmxz: Yeah the execute will be about 100k so relevant if someone's health stays below 35% for more than 1.5secs
[0:37:49] Axtin: u can just not spec into instant flash
[0:38:00] jonathan_mop: Yeah you got flash heal and word of glory.
[0:38:08] ferahgok: @Axtin Yea I was just gonna say this
[0:38:11] Shores2424: HPAL BUFFS TO THE MOON BABY
[0:38:15] Slandii: yea buff ret healing, just nerf all their other immunities, instant cc, damage, range. Should be good then
[0:38:16] phanabananana: @Axtin I bet if i checked you spec into it lol thats the point you have to
[0:38:17] Magottx: What rating do you play at brother man @phanabananana
[0:38:20] dismantlle: do you think fire is going to be good with these changes?
[0:38:25] jonathan_mop: Buff paladins period.
[0:38:33] nightmxz: I love when people say things that aren't true and the spec experts are just hanging out in here ready to squash the misinformation KEKW
[0:38:38] magebrainx: ive killed  dr. weavil 23 times tonight and no toy :(
[0:38:39] Axtin: @phanabananana lol yea because you dont need to cast heals
[0:38:40] jonathan_mop: More Bops!
[0:38:58] cajovysacok: flesh light not even woth pressing it heal like 10k LUL LUL LUL LUL
[0:39:15] Nethylol: guy convenently ignores that ret has the best defensive toolkit in bop, magic bop, freedom, sanc etc.
[0:39:15] AethrosTempest: this is a different topic but I'm not sure why Blizz thinks Arms Warrior and BM Hunter need more damage
[0:39:18] magebrainx: what is this guys point even? that the op flash of light talent isnt fun?
[0:39:21] Axtin: ret offhealing does suck tbh but they have a bunch of other good shit
[0:39:22] jonathan_mop: Plus you win before you need heals.
[0:39:26] phanabananana: Ill donate 10 subs if any of your shuffs you were above any of the other 4 in flash of light heals lol
[0:39:27] Blumee9: @cajovysacok Flesh light? HUH
[0:39:38] jonathan_mop: Lay on hands is only heal you need.
[0:39:40] morrs: DIVINEEEEE STOOOOORM
[0:39:41] magebrainx: blessing of spellwarding is wild
[0:39:43] Magottx: Who donated for it tho
[0:40:02] dismantlle: and to what are we comparing ret healing? its not like ww, ferals etc offer good offheals
[0:40:11] magebrainx: ferals have zero offhealing
[0:40:12] foxyllama: ret doesnt need broken off healing with the utiltiy they have lol
[0:40:16] nightmxz: sanc which reduces 200k~ meaningful damage vs healing for 80k, which is better?
[0:40:21] magebrainx: its the worst of any hybrid this expac
[0:40:25] foxyllama: u guys dont want hybrids to heal lmfao
[0:40:34] Magottx: Rets are so decent right now how are we even having this conversation lol

[0:40:55] Magottx: There was nothing more annoying than rets and Boomies healing more than healers in MoP
[0:40:59] cajovysacok: i would bop him
[0:41:09] morrs: I hope they Remove Lay on Hands
[0:41:15] magebrainx: @Magottx happened more recently than that, do you rememeber shadowlands? lol
[0:41:21] Axtin: i like the idea of a hybrid having big offhealing if they dont have much utility
[0:41:22] nightmxz: I did arena123 harpoon for harpoon kick lmao
[0:41:36] jonathan_mop: True, and no. We need three stacks of Lay on Hands.
[0:41:37] mneYEP: you need the coordinate assault kill shot macro too.. very important
[0:41:46] Falcanus: you start playing survival and all of a sudden... bam... massive survival buffs... hmmm
[0:41:57] Magottx: @magebrainx I actually didn’t play SL like at all lol
[0:41:58] nightmxz: eles do big off healing but the weakness is they oom a lot
[0:41:59] mneYEP: its hard to explain...
[0:42:09] magebrainx: Magottx for the best my man. it was dark times
[0:42:10] Krykoda: how are queues ? been taking a break cuz couldnt find games unless in group finder for an hour or an hour of solo queue
[0:42:10] jonathan_mop: Double the divine and blessings, and then triple lay
[0:42:10] Gleds: Holinka left though?
[0:42:15] Falcanus: same day turnaround on those buffs
[0:42:20] Magottx: Hey! @magebrainx i saw you outside org last night!
[0:42:28] TheKidRobin: yeah pretty sure he did i thought too?
[0:42:39] dismantlle: is it frost>arcane>fire now? @venruki
[0:42:43] Snohconez: pretty sure blizzard just uses chatgpt for their buff/nerfs at this point to save money
[0:42:49] cajovysacok: 2s are peacefull
[0:43:03] mneYEP: i think this is mine, theres lots of videos on why: /cast Kill Shot /cancelaura Aspect of the Turtle /cast bite /cast smack /cast claw /use [@mouseover,exists,harm,nodead][]Kill Shot /petattack /startattack [@target,exists]
[0:43:05] Destrarion: In the War Within, you will play Ranked Blitz ?
[0:43:06] magebrainx: Magottx well why didn't you say hi
[0:43:12] Magottx: I just had so much fun in 2s on my fresh windwalker
[0:43:15] Slandii: Tonyp is a big boi
[0:43:55] felstorms: are u a FOTM survival reroll after the buffs?
[0:43:58] Magottx: @magebrainx we literally said hi! I was on my rogue!
[0:44:12] magebrainx: OH haha
[0:44:25] cajovysacok: venruki meta slayer  he reroled instantly survival
[0:44:27] mneYEP: oops that wasnt it.. its this one sorry. turns off claw bite and smack for kill shots: /cast Coordinated Assault /use My'das Talisman /petautocastoff Bloody Screech; /petautocastoff Claw; /petautocastoff Bite; /petautocastoff Smack;
[0:45:25] mneYEP: basically those abilities fk over your kill shots.. short explaination
[0:46:37] Profess88: @venruki think pres evoker or rsham would be more fun in 2s with a destro lock?
[0:46:45] Slandii: i swear surv is always good its just super under represented
[0:47:08] dismantlle: sv is very hard to play
[0:47:28] dismantlle: better just smack forehead to keyboard and win on dh
[0:47:29] theodeth: this is the good vibes song
[0:48:54] Hobblefoot: You know who has been asking for Survival Buffs for the last month or so???   That is right.  THIS GUY!   Although I actually would have preferred a defensive buff.  But that is just me.
[0:49:32] Hobblefoot: Oh it is not awful
[0:49:46] Snohconez: 3 min cd 40% wall for 6 seconds lol
[0:49:53] Slandii: @dismantlle i completely disagree that surv is hard. Im a very average player (around 1900r max) and i picked up surv fast and got 2k for the first time
[0:49:57] mneYEP: @Snohconez exactly lol
[0:50:21] Snohconez: also pet sac is kinda bad as a defensive anymore
[0:50:31] felstorms: @Snohconez 90% feign death wall for 3 seconds every 30 seconds, turtle.... their defense is fine
[0:50:36] mneYEP: i actually think sac is ok
[0:50:52] younotmytwin: @felstorms agreed this is the best hunters have had it in awhile lmao
[0:51:11] dismantlle: @Slandii I think its generally agreed that its one of the hardest specs. in s1 I played ww to 2.6k but struggled with my sv at like 2.2k
[0:51:52] Wrathbb1: I kinda like that the patch notes are pretty much what people wanted, even if people wish the buffs/nerfs were harder
[0:52:18] Hobblefoot: Okay so very small things perhaps. Like maybe a slight change to Nature's Endurance.  Or Survival of the Fittist.  Now I could get greedy and say pump Natural Mending but that is not really what I want.  Maybe the PVP Survival Tactics getting one more second (4 seconds)  Truly nothing big and not all of them ... Just a tweak to one or two of those things.  I don't want survival OP.  Just like I don't like Outlaw OP
[0:52:29] cajovysacok: gugugaga
[0:52:29] TheBAMSportsShow: sup g happy friday
[0:52:29] DecocoTv: nOT FEELIN IT
[0:52:34] DecocoTv: Not feelin it*
[0:52:34] Wrathbb1: at least she has a good voice
[0:52:37] RotkidAU: Yo I had a DH like you video happen. I got the video too haha
[0:52:59] Hobblefoot: This song is nice. A good road trip song through the Southwest.
[0:53:02] absterge: 495 raiders from absterge have joined! 
[0:53:09] Magottx: I’m feeling it
[0:53:11] catchclause: hello ruki
[0:53:15] Slandii: @dismantlle Bruz its undoubtedly not agreed upon to be one of the hardest specs.
[0:53:33] Wrathbb1: now this
[0:53:35] Wrathbb1: THIS is a slap
[0:53:57] dismantlle: @Slandii we are talking about survival hunter right? i dont know if ur trolling
[0:54:40] Slandii: @dismantlle absolutely not trolling man. In PvE and PvP there are at least 5-7 specs drastically harder to play and understand than surv
[0:54:40] buffnac: sv is 100% agreed upon as being one of the hardest specs, playing a spec to 2k doesn’t determine if it’s hard or not
[0:54:46] nikthevoker: thats what good hunters do, be annoying LUL
[0:55:10] Hobblefoot: @Slandii I 85% agree with you. It is harder in PVE I would say min/maxing the bomb damage and when to throw them and when to hold back.  PVP is a bit startling at first but gets easier fast.  Then becomes one of the most fun specs in the game.
[0:55:17] dismantlle: yeah there is no question whether sv is hard or not its harder than most in pvp
[0:55:17] RotkidAU: <3
[0:55:18] absterge: made it to r1 range on disc and holy priest. r5 and r4. IT WAS A SOLID EVENING OF SOLO SHUFFLE ARENA

[0:55:23] lazyturtle0824: <3
[0:55:24] Slandii: @buffnac im a PvE guy mainly lad, surprisingly i actually got CE this tier on Surv. Im pretty confident I understand Surv.
[0:55:28] KerrbyWoW: <3 <3 <3
[0:55:45] buffnac: pve and pvp are different games lad

[0:55:54] nikthevoker: i usually get the tilted sterge CHARGING at healers LUL
[0:56:25] CdubBray: you excited for frost buffs on tuesday i take it ven?
[0:56:28] dismantlle: @Slandii maybe you should ask some people around of something im not about to argue about this, lol
[0:56:45] Slandii: @dismantlle dont be an argumentative cunt for the sake of it then ya muppet
[0:56:56] terranapart: Yo Ven!
[0:57:16] RotkidAU: Do you think WoW AWC would benefit from something like the Compendium DOTA2 Does?
[0:57:19] unc0de: yall...its friday, and theres a beautiful man pvping for your enjoyment... clam the juices
[0:57:25] Hobblefoot: @dismantlle I wouldn't argue either. It is a subjective debate and something that is hard for one person might not be for another.  .... @Slandii  Just became a jerk I see.  Oof.
[0:57:26] felstorms: cant believe frost is getting buffed. It was already good
[0:57:26] dismantlle: @Slandii I mean you are just wrong and saying "its easy for me because I have played it and got to 2k" so its not hard
[0:57:32] terranapart: Good man, hope you're doing good as well.
[0:57:36] Wrathbb1: @unc0de ven is kinda pretty, aint he?
[0:57:39] prolyphicttv: whaddup ven! you think fire mages might make a comeback after the tuesday changes?
[0:57:48] unc0de: @Wrathbb1 hes beautiful in and out
[0:58:17] prolyphicttv: i lowkey feel like WW/Fire mage and Hpal will be nasty with both the Hpal and Fire mage buffs
[0:58:19] Slandii: put a new player on a surv and they will have a significantly better time than if you put them on a fire mage, arcane mage, sub rogue, outlaw rogue, enh sham
[0:58:27] Slandii: am i wrong?
[0:58:34] Slandii: @dismantlle
[0:58:34] Hobblefoot: I love the "If something is easy for me, that means it is easy for everyone and therefore I am right and any arguments against it are wrong and anyone that struggles is awful and blah blah blah"
[0:58:46] Wrathbb1: i love WoW
[0:58:48] unc0de: yall need some milk
[0:58:49] Wrathbb1: we are not the same
[0:58:56] unc0de: I love venruki......and whiskey
[0:59:02] Hobblefoot: @Slandii Yes you are wrong but not wrong all the time.
[0:59:23] Slandii: @Hobblefoot tell me what part of that message is wrong then lad
[0:59:27] Immortal1266: don't forget to set up some binds
[0:59:47] dismantlle: @Slandii arcane, sub, and sv are imo hardest specs
[0:59:54] zachgamegodx: take it to dms
[0:59:56] zachgamegodx: no name calaling
[1:00:02] unc0de: @venruki SET UP SOME BINDS HOMIE BRO\
[1:00:03] Wrathbb1: hey ruki set up some binds after this
[1:00:13] imitatewater: @venruki easiest melee for shuffle in your opinion?
[1:00:13] cleezyyy: Hey ruki set up some binds after this
[1:00:18] Hobblefoot: @Slandii The idea that the rule applies to everyone.  Me for example (worse than you at PVP btw) find Arcane to be slightly easier than Survival.  But because I believe that does not make it the rule for everyone.
[1:00:38] nikthevoker: arguing over sv hunter LUL
[1:00:45] cajovysacok: i just realize there is no dh in loby  that is insane LUL
[1:00:52] prolyphicttv: @nikthevoker this lol
[1:01:09] Wrathbb1: if trille can play it how hard can it be Kappa
[1:01:13] Hobblefoot: @venruki You know me.  I get in the same stupid fight.  I get annoyed at hyperbolic comments and argue that these debates get too heated for nothing because they are subjective.
[1:01:15] dismantlle: I just said survival is considered one of the hardest specs but apparently i was wrong xd
[1:01:35] prolyphicttv: @Wrathbb1 trill is a freak of nature with whatever he plays..actually ridiculous how good he is
[1:01:46] Wrathbb1: I mean I feel like the real argument is over the word "hardest"
[1:01:53] Hobblefoot: @dismantlle Technically you can't be wrong.  Now if you worded it "Everyone in the game feels that Survival is the hardest spec"  well then you would be wrong.
[1:02:02] unc0de: haha..."hardest.".....
[1:02:02] Moobot: YouTube channel: youtube.com/venruki * Subscribe for new content!
[1:02:02] Slandii: @Hobblefoot you can very easily get to a reasonable rating by legit presing Mongoose bite, defensives and petstun/trap. Imagine saying that about pressing arc blast, poly and RoF. Youd get nowhere
[1:02:29] nikthevoker: is it me, or does ven make caster look chill, i do not get same effects LUL
[1:02:31] Wrathbb1: @Slandii shit now i wanna play sv
[1:02:31] Saitistreamy: @Slandii by that argument all melee classes are easy though
[1:02:35] Saitistreamy: oh wait thats true melee is easy
[1:02:41] mneYEP: lol
[1:02:45] zachgamegodx: p sure he was abusing aug last szn]
[1:02:51] zachgamegodx: the pres
[1:02:57] zachgamegodx: was #1 ladder
[1:03:07] RotkidAU: DONT FORGET TO SETUP YOUR BINDS. Also do you think WoW AWC would benefit from something like the Compendium DOTA2 Does?
[1:03:11] Moobot: rukiCool rukiBuddy rukiBuddy rukiBuddy rukiBuddy p2ete WELCOME TO THE BUDDY CLUB! rukiBuddy rukiBuddy rukiBuddy rukiBuddy rukiBuddy rukiCool
[1:03:15] Hobblefoot: @Slandii Well I get nowhere either way so that is besides the point.  But I don't think you can get a 2000 rating just using those things.  Not a single bomb?  Not a Kill Command.  No more Coordinated Assault.  Seems hard to believe.
[1:03:19] Slandii: realistically not all mellee specs have a fat damage multiplier that stacks x5 on their main ST ability just by pressing it haha
[1:03:19] unc0de: CHALLENGER...U DID IT @venruki congrats
[1:03:28] Fros365: Are you playing the anti-button bloat build?
[1:03:28] Slandii: nah def not 2k
[1:03:42] Slandii: absolutely didnt say 2k, confident in saying you could break 1600 tho doing that
[1:03:52] cajovysacok: why no 7-0 you are out of from venruki Kappa
[1:03:54] Hobblefoot: @Slandii Side Note:  I do agree that Survival is not nearly as hard as people suggest it is.
[1:03:59] Magottx: Ven I’m supposed to tell you something
[1:04:06] unc0de: BINNNNNNNNNNNDS
[1:04:16] prolyphicttv: keybind brother
[1:04:22] Cvarks: W changes
[1:04:25] RotkidAU: Do you think DOTA2 Compendium would work for WoW AWC
[1:04:26] Wrathbb1: PLAY sURVIVAL
[1:04:29] Hobblefoot: @Slandii There is a rule:  If I can get 1800 on a spec it cannot be hard.  Because I am awful at this game I love.
[1:04:32] Wrathbb1: chat neds it
[1:04:33] Cvarks: perfect arcane nerfs imo
[1:04:39] terranapart: @venruki have you gone over the class tunings scheduled for March 12th, did I miss it?
[1:04:44] Bokk1: Prayge sv
[1:04:45] unc0de: @venruki play surv...apparently is super easy to get 3k with
[1:04:47] unc0de: Kappa
[1:04:50] Kenny_77: is frost mage a good class to start with for a beginner?
[1:05:00] terranapart: The wheel has no mercy!

[1:05:20] Wrathbb1: depends on waht kind of beginner you are tbh
[1:05:21] unc0de: <3
[1:05:29] Cvarks: i just hope the fire and frost buffs are enough to add some variety
[1:05:30] Cvarks: to mages
[1:05:35] Cvarks: arcane stale
[1:05:36] Wrathbb1: like I enjoy learning the hard stuff first cause im a slow learner who learns things forever
[1:05:38] dakila24: destro set portal nerf was actually quite nice
[1:05:40] zachgamegodx: frost bolt build about to pop off
[1:05:41] prolyphicttv: thats cheating sir

[1:05:47] unc0de: EZ ELE GAME
[1:05:47] prolyphicttv: have to obey the wheel
[1:05:48] terranapart: I say play whatever!
[1:05:48] Hobblefoot: The changes are a solid B+ ....  Sad about the Destro nerf to the fire portal thingy.
[1:05:54] prolyphicttv: im kiddin do you
[1:05:55] darkness031419: Obey the  wheel lol
[1:05:58] zachgamegodx: u get alot of brain freezes for free on frost from frost bomb
[1:06:02] Gleds: resto will be quick
[1:06:02] Wrathbb1: if you learn fast but have problems remembering things start with easy classes

[1:06:30] Hobblefoot: @gdodmebxu Well yeah but it is just so fun to play!  LOL
[1:06:43] terranapart: 50 pushups, just do 10 every few mins
[1:06:45] gdodmebxu: @Hobblefoot it feels so troll to proc 3 and just oneshot someone
[1:06:49] Saitistreamy: vacation is a walking work out thing
[1:06:53] Saitistreamy: where you going?
[1:06:57] Shores2424: get on the xaryu routine
[1:07:00] imitatewater: @venruki can you do pull ups somewhere?
[1:07:01] zachgamegodx: italy has pull up bars at every block
[1:07:03] SloppyWalrus_: buy a set of bands
[1:07:04] Krykoda: vacations make for the best sight seeing runs
[1:07:08] terranapart: damn, Italy, nice
[1:07:13] Hobblefoot: @gdodmebxu Clearly you are not a desperate casual looking for wins anyway you can.  Like me!
[1:07:15] Saitistreamy: my understanding is that is a fuck ton of walking / hiking basically
[1:07:16] imitatewater: @venruki pull ups and dips and u gucci
[1:07:27] Wrathbb1: @zachgamegodx I gave myself tendinitis from doing pullups wrong/too often lmao
[1:07:28] Magottx: Fun fact it takes 10 days for all fibers to fully recover so if you go omega ham right before you’ll be more than ok
[1:07:36] cajovysacok: i have home gym but i go in to normal gym LUL LUL
[1:07:47] zachgamegodx: u may not be able to do pull ups  in italy, the bar is intended for 5'5 and under
[1:07:51] Hobblefoot: Oh you know what I liked ... The Disc buffs. Those looked kinda neat.
[1:07:54] Tragictomb: so Ven what do you think happened to those DK changes, lost in the void?
[1:07:58] prolyphicttv: @zachgamegodx LOL

[1:09:22] Wrathbb1: Sweden is 181 CM (5'11.5")
[1:09:28] Wrathbb1: but the US/Canada is same as italy
[1:09:46] prolyphicttv: pretty sure all nordic countries have 5'11/6ft and above as averages...vikings
[1:09:52] Wrathbb1: @prolyphicttv yee
[1:09:53] Hobblefoot: @venruki Bullshit.  The average height is 6'1 .... Average weight is a lean 215 pounds of muscle.  Average income is 150k a year.  Duh.  Why else would every woman want that on Match.com.
[1:09:57] dismantlle: lobbing meatballs

[1:10:35] Wrathbb1: all other apps suck
[1:10:39] dismantlle: and there is 10 times more bots there than actual women
[1:10:41] zachgamegodx: it doesn't hold up in towns @Saitistreamy ??
[1:10:42] Hobblefoot: That does not bode well for my 5'9 frame.  Shit.

[2:12:03] Wrathbb1: he also has "one tap on the head could be a stroke" strength
[2:12:04] nikthevoker: im sure hes on some heavy drugs
[2:12:06] jhop7002: You see him hit a bag lately? He's still got it - not prime Tyson but he has it
[2:12:11] Cephqt: Tyson is 30 years older than Jake

[2:14:38] walokki: Theu should make rank 1 in 2v2
[2:14:48] Krykoda: yeah but thats a boxer vs a martial artist not jake paul cherry picking old dudes it makes sense
[2:14:58] williwhite94: @magebrainx i think mech is good i dont think they can be feared also
[2:15:09] Krykoda: that one tiktok dude bryce whatever is actually respectable, hes doing bare knuckle fights, actually becoming good at the sport

[2:35:07] dreambear__: A
[2:35:07] demtrollzZ: @GosuDucky wouldnt that be achieved by not allowing streamers to advertise their onlyfans?
[2:35:33] drgobblinpants: not S but solid dmg if left alone
[2:36:05] LiLBiGBERT: good S priest can carry. survivability. damage, peels, off heals, good set up, good for damp.
[2:36:09] drgobblinpants: very small nerf but we will see less dh's
[2:36:26] kyaii: I for one can't believe they didn't nerf frost dk. They can't keep getting away with it
[2:36:51] LiLBiGBERT: frost dk hits like a nerf noodle from my 3rd grade year in the pool
[2:37:22] demtrollzZ: Im still living off of them giving frost 2H back, the spec needs to be garbage for 5 expansions in a row for me to complain
[2:37:52] ajxo1: can someone link the changes
[2:38:06] Synthetic29: just made a druid quit on solo and afk as a shaman i feel good

[2:38:48] drgobblinpants: it's not a flex
[2:38:58] MaximumnNeo: i love how they buff atonement every patch and it literalyl never does anything
[2:39:05] MaximumnNeo: disc is still garbage
[2:39:14] Kymagez: are you flexing saying its not a flex?
[2:39:20] LiLBiGBERT: buff devastation burst :)
[2:40:07] drgobblinpants: i mean the whole game is 50 years old and non competitive

[2:42:02] MaximumnNeo: helldiver 2 is so much fun if you play with friends
[2:42:05] drgobblinpants: i bet not as many
[2:42:32] drgobblinpants: its way cool love the game
[2:42:38] MaximumnNeo: its got a really neat mechanic, where everyboy is trying to achieve game wide objectives, and ranges from very easy to very hard
[2:42:40] MaximumnNeo: i quite like it
[2:42:47] MaximumnNeo: and im generally not much for shooters
[2:43:19] drgobblinpants: gotta jump ship once microsoft closes blizz down lmao

[2:43:30] mzaamentor: are we going to see some Ieatmages or Tossin dik gameplay?

[2:44:16] drgobblinpants: bro is getting sexual
[2:44:28] wackpoetic: but then you can't say BERRIES WITH CREAM BERRIES WITH CREAM
[2:44:32] checkemcharles: genghis khan told his soldiers to eat yogurt because it made them brave
[2:44:39] mzaamentor: Is this GoT
[2:44:49] xkayne: do the dance
[2:44:59] xkayne: berrys and cream berrys and cream

[2:46:28] drgobblinpants: sounds racist
[2:46:36] Kymagez: america is stupiid
[2:46:40] Cephqt: because before globalization, standardization wasnt a thing
[2:46:42] Cephqt: real answer
[2:46:42] MaximumnNeo: because they have different voltage and wattage
[2:46:44] mzaamentor: culture lol idk
[2:46:46] demtrollzZ: its pretty dumb ye
[2:46:47] kingceejay90: you should see South Koreas
[2:46:56] kingceejay90: i was super confused when I get stationoed in South Korea
[2:46:57] bhphreak: because our society and species are still children tier
[2:47:02] bhphreak: give it 1000 years
[2:47:03] PhoenixPhireX: Would cost too much money to go back and fix every single home to the new standard.
[2:47:03] drgobblinpants: look at the iphone changing because of EU
[2:47:13] SemosTraining: beacuse if you were colonized by the british you were a loser and still are
[2:47:13] xkayne: USB C for all

[2:48:09] drgobblinpants: you don't have to re-wire the whole house
[2:48:32] mzaamentor: Yeah it is lol
[2:48:39] drgobblinpants: they are all usb-c now
[2:48:45] SithLordBob: cause apple wants to make money and use unique crap
[2:48:46] Reconr: ven you play ele at all?
[2:48:56] mzaamentor: maybe its because of laws and regulations differing tho
[2:48:59] drgobblinpants: iphone got pushed to change it becuase of the EU
[2:49:00] jjeliades2424: candian obesity rate is basically the same as the usa lol
[2:49:16] nemziac: just like certain ev chargers not letting you use them if you dont have their car
[2:49:48] drgobblinpants: usa 76
[2:49:50] drgobblinpants: lmao
[2:49:52] magebrainx: usa is approaching 50 unfortuantely i think?
[2:49:53] wackpoetic: everything's bigger in texas

[2:50:26] mzaamentor: Keep stuffing ur face of taco bell n Mcdonalds breh
[2:50:31] Acurarx: if you have any muscle you’re considered obese
[2:50:48] magebrainx: LOL
[2:50:49] drgobblinpants: what about my love muscle
[2:50:51] skydog70: lmao
[2:50:52] kingceejay90: lmaooooo
[2:51:24] magebrainx: ozempic exists we're fine
[2:51:40] Nikademous: i just found out our wheat is illegal in alot of countries
[2:51:41] drgobblinpants: just mask it with apple vr
[2:51:43] Acurarx: we have a health fair at my firm every year. they go based off height and weight. I’m 5’10 185. 33 waist. I rank as overweight on the chart.
[2:51:47] wackpoetic: i've literally heard people say that they eat cookies before going to the doctor to spike their blood sugar so they can get ozempic
[2:51:52] drgobblinpants: no one will be obese behind VR
[2:52:03] mzaamentor: I saw your and Supatease vid about those dh bots and it’s seriously concerning @venruki
[2:52:14] Magottx: He’s actually not wrong on some basic charts I’m obese if you go off height weight too lol but 4.6% bf lmao
[2:52:16] magebrainx: Acurarx that may be true, but the amount of people skewing the obesity numbers due to muscle mass is very very small.
[2:52:47] drgobblinpants: thats nuts
[2:52:49] magebrainx: must be pretty costly for them id imagine
[2:52:55] magebrainx: unless they have diabetes
[2:52:59] Nikademous: becuz money
[2:53:06] phanabananana: calculate brian shaw he would be considered morbidly obese lol
[2:53:06] MaximumnNeo: you can basically just buy it online and they have "Doctors" that will prescribe it
[2:53:11] wackpoetic: I mean if taking ozempic replaces steroids I guess that's a net benny
[2:53:15] Magottx: Seems like they have a mental issue more so tbh
[2:53:22] Magottx: Some body dismorphia
[2:53:25] drgobblinpants: shes gets it from DR oz
[2:53:36] magebrainx: wackpoetic they are two completely different unrelated things ozempic and steroids
[2:53:38] mzaamentor: tf is ozempic
[2:53:46] jfeliciano007: Everything is so highly processed here with so many chemicals and preservatives. Dude my nephew wanted oreos and it had high fructose corn syrup and corn syrup and dextrose lol
[2:53:47] drgobblinpants: weight loss drug
[2:53:55] magebrainx: ozempic is a newer class of diabetes drugs.
[2:53:58] mzaamentor: wtf lmao
[2:53:59] Nikademous: curbs hunger
[2:54:03] wackpoetic: magebrainx yes I understand lol, I'm mostly kidding but I'd rather find out someone is taking ozempic to look good instead of steroids
[2:54:10] drgobblinpants: crub stomps fat
[2:54:12] mzaamentor: just go take a jog
[2:54:21] magebrainx: sodium glucose cotransporter inhibitor. really good for diabetes with the "side effect" of weight loss
[2:54:26] dismantlle: I dont actively ever try to gain weight but its really easy to stay skinny for me
[2:54:27] drgobblinpants: doesn't work that way with diabettes boy
[2:54:32] Synkz_00: This is whimsical
[2:54:45] Acurarx: I’m by no means saying the obesity rate isn’t high, but that old school BMI is severely outdated, but still used to dictate insurance rates/coverage. and doesn’t account for different body types. some people are just big, but not overweight; just corn fed, but will rank as obese or overweight. That’s all I was getting at :)
[2:54:50] Imorteus: i take it currently. you really notice it if your meals have protein you can go so long til next one
[2:55:18] Nikademous: i am for sure

[2:55:38] devascienos: remember when they nerfed enhance healing all all theyve been doing is buffing it over and over again
