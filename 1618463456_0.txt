[1:07:15] dylandevsstuff: But I do agree kinda. But I guess it makes you engage more

[1:23:23] dyslexican1: lol imagine ragingout oof a M+ on beta for beta testing lol
[1:23:54] 91Niki: @dyslexican1 I mean we don't know that for sure. But if it's the case, it's dumb yeah
[1:23:55] KaisenSiru: yyjGa
[1:24:16] KaisenSiru: Quest Pog
[1:24:40] asmodai4823: its just a bad affix atm
[1:24:54] Wcvechten: they could've given like a stormsurge buff if you're electrified or  something
[1:24:56] 91Niki: At least it should give you a dps buff or something if you dodge?
[1:25:00] Rottencoarse: @Towelliee  do you know if Evoker's Zephyr reduces the affix's damage?
[1:25:06] Molvonos: There's no kiss/curse, it's just 'Bite the pillow' amounts of energy.
[1:25:14] mbc0794: what do you recomand for getting faster to 80 on wotlk , questing or dungeoning? :D
[1:25:27] Broomba: That repair bill kekw
[1:25:36] HD_MOVIE_SOURCE: so what does the affix do? @Towelliee
[1:25:51] MoodyVanessa: Sanguine Depths with Thundering
[1:26:09] luvgamezx: Rumor has it that they are taking Dragon riding out of WM,Is that true?
[1:26:49] Artiiz: This season affix is complete garbage, it adds nothing to Mythic+ except just Quaking v2.0
[1:27:00] TheSteve: jade serpent will be awful with it
[1:27:01] hwiyo: tol dagor lol
[1:27:10] PToastman: it adds challenge
[1:27:36] Zucchey: That layer is bugged, you need a new one
[1:27:49] touchofpinkfizz: towHAMUP towHAMUP towHAMUP towHAMUP towHAMUP
[1:28:00] AWreal: halls of valor might be annoying.. you don't have much wiggle room in there with the old skip strats
[1:28:08] touchofpinkfizz: hi there @Towelliee and hammer squad
[1:28:32] TotallyNotRaien: thundering should let the group funnel the energy to one party member, it would give that player a buff and shoot off one set of lightning that deal a lot more damage
[1:28:42] pereadin: Hopin on rn if you need healer
[1:28:57] notdustinx: Forgot the druid
[1:29:10] notdustinx: Druid
[1:29:28] LonelyGoose_: Target is Unfriendly message

[1:29:39] Blackmarsh: @Towelliee What do you think of the guardian druid tier set changes?
[1:29:43] BlewGamingGroup: he had to go wash his cat
[1:30:13] Rottencoarse: @Towelliee  u seen the retri nerfs? :D

[1:30:57] ArcaneSyntax: ret was overturned for like all of the testing cycle, people need to chill
[1:31:07] th30dor: the PUG nightmare happening on the beta as well monkaS
[1:31:07] Edog7476: frost Pog
[1:31:10] notdustinx: The nerfs are just balancing. Didn‚Äôt kill any classes imo
[1:31:16] pereadin: I‚Äôm on loading screen T_T
[1:31:22] lvl98bulbasaur: is that dps and healing meter an addon or part of the game?
[1:31:49] th30dor: moonkins still have a very attractive damage profile. And rogue has 3 specs, im sure one of them will be good. RIP ret tho
[1:31:49] Moobot: I will be leveling a toon on the NA Fresh Server Maladath (Normal) 8/30. 3-4 Day Mini-Thon for Launch. Gonna hit Max Level and get some quick gear!

[1:32:32] th30dor: its a buff compared to shadowlands
[1:32:52] riversc17: @Towelliee hows DF in your opinion is it worth playing
[1:32:55] Zucchey: turning rewards to max 20 is bad imo
[1:32:58] th30dor: so yes, not what some people want, but its progress
[1:33:00] DisguisedOG: HC challenge brought alot of players to classic
[1:33:04] abracka_: good mornin towHAMUP towHAMUP
[1:33:05] brozzy: i hate this part of beta where everyone freaks out about tuning
[1:33:46] inj0shwetrust: In current structure though the incentive to do mythic raiding is low considering the reward structure currently
[1:34:19] inj0shwetrust: Timing a +15 is far easier
[1:34:19] Moobot: towHAMUP Follow Towelliee on twitter so you can be in the know at all times! | twitter.com/towelthetank towKawaii
[1:34:21] kowaikokoro: +20 in week 1 is near impossible LUL
[1:34:26] KaisenSiru: +20 Pog
[1:34:36] 3663Sharad: Its such a joke
[1:34:36] akaari5486: do we have to fly to badlands to reach uldaman or there is some kind of port btw
[1:34:36] Moobot:  Please visit towelliee.com to get caught up on all of the latest Youtube videos, Discord links, sponsor information and news/events that may be coming up in the stream!
[1:34:38] Zucchey: 20 will be alot harder than 20 in shadowlands
[1:34:41] MarquisLek: +20 or nut
[1:34:42] Tigerklaue: +20 is also same as +23/24 now cause of the scaling
[1:34:44] Zucchey: 8 scale instead of 10%
[1:34:45] Mitune: Yeah +20 is soo much harder than heroic lol
[1:34:47] Clicklesly: Also 20 will be a lot harder now with scaling change post 11
[1:34:49] Zucchey: reverse* :d
[1:34:54] inj0shwetrust: now making +20 vaults be close to on par with end raid mythic loots.... Im cool with that
[1:35:37] th30dor: its a bit more than that. You can spam +20. You can only do 1 mythic per week.
[1:35:38] ZellieMasters: I could "complete" a 20 but honestly that's a bit ridiculous.
[1:36:15] Mitune: what even is the percentage of players that complete a 20 anyway?
[1:36:36] lithium364: just buy boosts for both Kappa
[1:36:41] th30dor: 6 weeks in you can do the thing
[1:36:55] 3663Sharad: Blizz trying to kill M+, Affix garbo, ilvl garbo
[1:36:58] swcesq: it's harder to get 20 people to do something than five
[1:37:06] ArcaneSyntax: mythic raiding is harder to do.
[1:37:07] Zucchey: @Mitune  It's not gonna even be a 20 anyway, since is scales more, it will be like a +23 on shadowlands
[1:37:07] Barret: even though mythic raiding is becoming less popular
[1:37:09] akacvrtops: the death of raiding
[1:37:11] inj0shwetrust: The thing with m+ is you dont have lockouts weekly
[1:37:16] Thoreya: they should just accept the fact that more ppl prefer m+
[1:37:19] th30dor: m+ got the most changes this expansion since it came out in legion. People are just dooming
[1:37:22] Gingerprimer: Mythic raiding is way harder aswell
[1:37:22] Thoreya: and adjust do it
[1:37:25] Thoreya: to it*
[1:37:26] akacvrtops: the death of raiding lol
[1:37:27] inj0shwetrust: aside from the vault
[1:37:27] feherlofia123: which dungeons are the "new" (old dungeons) do we know that
[1:37:29] akaari5486: m+ is easier :D
[1:37:29] abracka_: i would bet money a lot of people would
[1:37:29] ralecgos: i feel like coordinating 20 people should be rewarded more than coordinating 5 people
[1:37:31] manmower: seems fair
[1:37:32] zilzihan: in a heart beat
[1:37:34] Holysal: @Thoreya they never will lol
[1:37:40] PToastman: can't both be popular
[1:37:41] kowaikokoro: 5 mans is the future and theyre afraid of that
[1:37:43] manmower: mythic raiders enjoy working out the the raid puzzle, different challenge
[1:37:48] asmodai4823: thats just admiting m+ is better content lol
[1:37:50] inj0shwetrust: @ralecgos I agree
[1:37:50] Aquadriel: @Towelliee why dont they do m+ gear be like pvp, only scale up while in a M+ instance.
[1:37:52] Gingerprimer: @feherlofia123 yeah you can google df m+ season 1 pool
[1:37:52] Thoreya: @Holysal its a shame. 5 player content is the future
[1:37:55] playb0yl0vr: i think it would help people getting gear to go mythic raiding as a pug tho
[1:38:05] ralecgos: just add more 10 man raids to the game honestly. the mega dungeons are super fun too
[1:38:05] Mitune: The 2nd boss of this place honestly feels like a raid fight Lol
[1:38:10] akacvrtops: valor!!!!
[1:38:11] th30dor: @asmodai4823 its easier, and repeatable. easier to find 5 people.
[1:38:12] Gingerprimer: Doubt It
[1:38:14] kowaikokoro: no shot valor is uncapped in season 1 LUL
[1:38:15] Megadisaster24: doubt it
[1:38:36] Mitune: I expect Valor to go uncapped when the catalyst goes active
[1:38:47] inj0shwetrust: Im sure theres Valor cap in season 1 for sure
[1:38:51] lithium364: probably because they WANT you to fill up some slots with profession gear in m+

[1:39:50] rxdderz_: is there anything to do in SL right now while waiting for DF?
[1:39:59] MarquisLek: i might actually do mythic+ dungeons
[1:40:01] feherlofia123: which dungeons are the "new" (old dungeons) do we know that
[1:40:08] ralecgos: you can tell they're really putting a lot of care into their decisions
[1:40:10] Holysal: this update is fine. ppl are salty they didnt get what they wanted
[1:40:13] Gingerprimer: @Rxdderz_ get the stuff that is going away in DF prepatch
[1:40:17] lithium364: theres also an warmode pvp set which goes all the way to heroic itemlvl
[1:40:39] 91Niki: I never saw the issue with casual players getting the same item level as mythic raiders, AS LONG as it is time gated.
[1:40:40] Gingerprimer: PPl are just mad they do not get Mythic end boss loot from a +10
[1:40:54] MarquisLek: fix is to be merged on tuesday
[1:41:01] KaisenSiru: Positive Pog
[1:41:02] feherlofia123: 2 of the dungeons are mop. what are the 2 other old ones
[1:41:16] abracka_: shots fired
[1:41:20] ZellieMasters: Those are the same people who buy boosts cause they suck anyways gingerprimer
[1:41:22] Saphirosa_Dragonaspect: I'm fine with the ilvl. I do 20+ keys normally and i don't raid. I'm just happy,that I'm able to get Tier sets
[1:41:32] Gingerprimer: Are there MDI players that are mad?
[1:41:36] AureliusXV: i got you
[1:41:43] ralecgos: mythic+ people want everyone to get bloodlust/heroism... I don't want more class homogenization personally. just make that ability unable to be used in mythic+ i dunno
[1:42:01] 91Niki: Not to mention, people don't look at item level with inviting for stuff anymore. They look for achievements or score ijpSHRUG
[1:42:03] Kakotan2143: towHAMUP towHAMUP towHAMUP towHAMUP
[1:42:20] abracka_: how would you say something so controversial yet so brave
[1:42:28] Holysal: M+ players have to raid anyways if they want their tier anyways

[1:43:26] Lazugo: I AM THE PAHSE
[1:43:35] dylandevsstuff: Relog maybe? He has to make party so yoh go to phase with vendor?
[1:43:55] Cisco_CWF: for me the ilvl thing isnt even the issue i have more issue with the hyper specific items that drop in raid or pvp that a mythic+ player would need the dinar system atleast helped this season with me getting gavel jaithys and OWS for my fury warrior i just dont want more really hyper specific pieces i need for keys from raid that are 10-20% ahead

[3:18:23] Tjenne92: @91Niki So basically... inception ?
[3:18:25] Vaellder: imo they're not going to add a dps part because they want it to be less consequential but i could see a nerf

[3:20:12] Hupu_a: i would like thundering be like the fires in everbloom like if it targets one person hits him with lightning bolt and it creates wave which needs to be jumped over @Towelliee

[3:24:42] yinkyslarmer12: I loved cata heroic difficulty, i still remember the ghostcrawler post "WoW dungeons are hard!"
[3:24:45] TacDuc: Is Prot Warrior still 10k damage above the other tanks
[3:25:03] Redpandalol: can you show your spec again please
[3:25:21] Rohen86: Just add a player buff that when the Thundering Triggers you get a dmg buff like Zapper Bots from Mechagon for like 10s and #BestAffixEver. The trick is you lose the buff if you get hit by another players lightning.
[3:25:25] TacDuc: Yeah, warrior has so much AoE
[3:25:34] ashnmsr: i might actually use elvui too because the npc's icon's aren't 3d in this one i don't get it why there isn't a choice for that

[4:05:07] PrimalRain: sounds like some bad shit
[4:05:08] ArcaneMaki: bear getting shunned again :(

[4:07:39] valianya: Guess they decided to go from kiss-curse seasonal  affixes to just curse.  I cannot see any benefit to thundering
[4:07:44] Mitune: the last two fights of this dungeon remind me of raid encounters in terms of what you neeed to do
[4:08:01] 91Niki: lol
[4:08:03] NA_Mus: So is this testing just to test thundering affix?
[4:08:05] PToastman: nice game blizzard
[4:08:08] ShabsieAU: woops, only strength
[4:08:23] 3663Sharad: BM stonks up, Surv down?
[4:08:27] Zucchey: Hunter is fine, move along
[4:08:31] 91Niki: @NA_Mus You can create keys with full affixes on them, but yeah I think he's just testing the dungeon + the seasonal affix
[4:08:42] NA_Mus: ah kk
[4:08:49] ProxyKalevra: sounds like something they will nerf at the last moment and break it so it is unplayable.
[4:08:53] NastyLilDolphin: didnt rogues get nerfed 32% last patch? i think hunters next
[4:08:55] ArcaneMaki: Boomkins got shunned big time :(
[4:08:57] bymz: This poor dk sadge
[4:09:00] ShabsieAU: MM is flying under the radar, but actually pretty stronk
[4:09:03] jeffnsteff2019: what about arcane mages
[4:09:05] PToastman: I've decided I am literally going to randomly generate which dps class to main at the start of df
[4:09:12] ThePawPaw: retri paladin was fine why they nerfed it after i did dungeon with 2 retir doing 150k each :D
[4:09:15] PToastman: dps spec
[4:09:17] valianya: Hunter needs a reason to be invited to raid and dungeon, so stronk
[4:09:43] protobuf: I love Galactic Guardian
[4:09:45] protobuf: feels nice
[4:10:15] Chopstix2005: correct
[4:10:24] Clicklesly: And Kill Cleave kinda
[4:10:27] pereadin: In 2 seasons of DF I think the damage of the dps phial will make more sense.
[4:10:27] MoodyVanessa: beast cleave is amazing.. right now i kinda hope it doesnt get nerfed lol
[4:10:31] BafflingRainbow: gotta keep that multishot up
[4:11:39] PToastman: am I the only one that can't bring themselves to say phial, I still say flask lol
[4:11:43] pereadin: yeah, I've been using the rank 3 ones too, they do 7.4k each proc

[4:12:04] Roaringkittylol: wI think they should just delete classes and give people a character that looks like them and a club - done.
[4:12:08] pocketdimension: @Towelliee thats thier button
[4:12:18] Chopstix2005: Can you spec for MAgic dmg mitigate
[4:12:26] Fedratsailor: 2 set and 4 set are about obliterate.
[4:12:30] valianya: Is it partly tier set that boosts barbed so beast cleave right?
[4:12:31] pereadin: Your trinket Kappa
[4:12:38] draconisraccoonis: Rage of the Sleeper

[4:17:16] valianya: Bear has never really had magic mitigation.  Bear is about health and overall armor mitigation
[4:17:27] kappaday23: and then you got prot pala Kappa rip
[4:17:31] syndakitt: have you tried prot pally in keys testing yet? even though so buggy

[4:17:49] Rictamar: yeh anyone trying to make judgements based on numbers right now is misguided, shit is going to change a lot still
[4:17:57] NetError: demon hunter class is dps only?
[4:18:07] Chopstix2005: @NetError no tank and dps
[4:18:13] syndakitt: prot pally still has over 50 bugs
[4:18:23] tev_hd: i think brew has a couple talents that dont work still
