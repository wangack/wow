[0:57:05] Psyquest: It is too costly. too much to farm. I used to farm hardcore and I am now too old to deal with the complexity of bosses now at the level of the top 3
[0:57:07] xonic_tv: I've just returned for the first time since Shadowlands - so much to take in playing DF

[0:58:47] phnxx87: tbh looking at myself i already cry when im forced to quest for a certain item/stuff whatever
[0:58:53] kult1010: just add the incentive "date with miss frosty upon completion" SeemsGood
[0:59:07] Psyquest: They cant get prestige back without removing boosting.
[0:59:11] KiwiGuy17: The mount is all there is, and the 496 rare trinkets
[0:59:34] Platex: did they get rid of the first 100 guilds title thing
[0:59:47] TwistyBro: aight imma go get some food and run a few errands
[0:59:53] TwistyBro: have a great stream Sco
[0:59:56] Psyquest: if anyone can be boosted for gold, there is no prestige in the reward.
[1:00:06] Firelord_Trolldemort: what if cutting edge had a mount as well
[1:00:10] phnxx87: so i already play Monk/DH ..... any other good tips for m+ : need to be funn do dmg and is not an instand decline class :D
[1:00:25] KiwiGuy17: hall of fame should get their own mount
[1:00:38] bullrag99: they should just make a r1 set+mount, a hall of fame set+mount and a r1 m+ set+mount
[1:00:42] Psyquest: You dont need gold no. they can put RTWF in a server with vendors.
[1:00:43] Firelord_Trolldemort: the achivement
[1:00:43] bullrag99: to go along with the titles
[1:01:03] Platex: they'll get so much pushback for a r1 mount, it won't happen
[1:01:09] spankymcpie: Selling heroic garrosh and mythic was insanely easy gold with the boa weapon
[1:01:24] Psyquest: Are you attached to your 12 alts?
[1:02:18] mahabbah: I there needs to be something that rewards the effort but doesn't involved keeping multiple characters of the same class
[1:02:52] Platex: it would work if it yoinked your main for the period of RfW1 to a different server
[1:02:57] Deluxe3313: Each mythic boss should drop a cosmetic spell change for one spell for each class
[1:03:20] phnxx87: im figuring out if i need to gear a mage... but well only thing i see they start to have value  key 26++
[1:04:33] Platex: that destroys longevity of the raid tier for anyone below the top
[1:05:26] phnxx87: the point is the community ask to much as in META , ACHIE , Experience , 485 + ilvl just to join a raid were u get 467
[1:05:42] Platex: there's a ton of guilds that meet to clear HC every week, the guild culture of the game revolves around that weekly lockout
[1:06:45] phnxx87: race world first should be hard
[1:06:47] Platex: do you feel like Blizzard support you directly ?
[1:06:51] phnxx87: your the top 0.001% of the game
[1:06:55] spankymcpie: I dont like what mythic+ has done as far as gearing goes. you used to be able to invite some insanely high ilvl person to a raid and they would slap. now some of those people drop the flame circle on roots in a heroic pug
[1:07:03] iMuru: iMuru subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 63 months! 
[1:08:22] phnxx87: people reflect race world first and rank 1 m+ runners to the casual envoirement of the game. lately i saw a +14 asking for Mage/Aug to clear key >.<
[1:08:29] Platex: wouldn’t it help if they did? would probably help with some of the issues you’ve spoken about (numbers of players etc)
[1:09:14] phnxx87: if there was no m+ the game would be dead long time ago
[1:09:36] KiwiGuy17: 60 people out of millions of wow players
[1:10:25] Platex: I also think about curving long term decline, it's their game, feels odd that they have no involvement
[1:10:42] Platex: 20 years in
[1:11:45] LepontX: is noggie gonna raid with method?
[1:12:07] spankymcpie: at least its mainstream enough now that teams have direct connections to make sure raid bugs get fixed  asasp
[1:12:27] LepontX: we will be glad to gather the raiders back to method
[1:14:04] Altariaz: Hey Sco, what's up? How was Thailand? Good? Never visited the nation.
[1:14:16] 6pack3eer: WB M8 ^^ Will u get back in active Raidung now u are back?
[1:14:57] Altariaz: Sounds good. What were your top 3 highlights?

[1:18:24] tinitot: top 3 for me food people culture in any order
[1:19:01] tinitot: thats why its called land of smiles
[1:19:14] spankymcpie: when i took my gf to japan i didnt know she could eat so much
[1:20:39] spankymcpie: was pretty cheap but some restaurants kind of take you by surprise and its like damn there goes $100
[1:21:23] Maxranviir: YOU'VE RETURNED
[1:23:26] Maxranviir: managing atm
[1:23:33] Maxranviir: busy week coming up
[1:24:35] phnxx87: To me thailand is my runner up after dubai
[1:24:42] phnxx87: phucket was beautifull
[1:25:14] phnxx87: ye for me yes
[1:25:25] Shako007: dubai, nothing there
[1:25:26] Maxranviir: isnt dubai just a glorified shopping centre?
[1:25:28] phnxx87: cause i like the mix of everything im not rly a nature man or a beach person
[1:25:29] Maxranviir: it just looks the same
[1:25:32] Maxranviir: went there in 2010

[1:29:08] phnxx87: but now me and the misses have 2 kiddos its all a bit on a hold , with a kid of 4 and 1,5 its kinda clunky:D
[1:29:28] phnxx87: ye abu dhabi i was also for 4 days
[1:29:33] phnxx87: last time i was there end 2018
[1:30:00] phnxx87: abu dhabi i did to see the fast and furious set places and to visit ferrari world + f1 circuit
[1:30:35] phnxx87: also went to that big mosque ... however im not a believer in anything of that stuff it was pretty impressive
[1:31:36] phnxx87: sheik zayed was it i believe?

[2:59:16] Imprison3d: considering that mythic raiding requires best min max everything
[2:59:59] Imprison3d: @Sco so if you were a hardcore mythic raider, then you wouldn't be belf on the hunter?
