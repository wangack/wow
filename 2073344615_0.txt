[5:17:03] Zircons: I think it was dumb, but I think passing the gate to move forward is their problem I guess?
[5:17:10] Suka025: Wasnt pet pulling thrue a wall the play in Mists first boss as well?
[5:17:14] Zircons: but there was the BRH clownshow yesterday

[5:20:19] alkhean: JB: "Rules are dumb". Also JB: "I hope this strat gets banned".
[5:21:06] alkhean: why would approved strat ever get unapproved? Legit only way it will ever happen is when you, max and last hope players keep being vocal about it
[5:21:51] BlakeFlair: what strat?
[5:22:00] caradea_: what strat are we talking about?
[5:22:19] alkhean: pulling strat upstairs between 2nd and 3rd boss into 2nd boss
[5:22:32] alkhean: pulling trash*
[5:22:49] Celissah: What strats have been done this week in the MDI that is discussable?
[5:22:49] alkhean: gate is closed but doable with evoker

[5:38:32] snse: killing mobs past 100% should give you back time
[5:38:33] chaigy: what if my gear depletes for every key and at some point your gear will just disappear
[5:39:23] cornhornborn: Id you deplete 3x in a row, your character gets deleted
[5:39:31] Wh1teRic3: people 100% leave just like nomral
[5:39:36] Wh1teRic3: this season isnt any less
[5:40:17] MrCasual_: It happens much more than he thinks
[5:40:25] Wh1teRic3: max is so sheltered.
[5:40:53] luckystriketwo: They should make m+ and m+ competitive part , if u deplete keys u lose 2 ilvl , and if u ++ u get 2 ilvl for 24h
[5:41:57] luckystriketwo: so more people can do high keys with better ilvl
[5:42:14] Wh1teRic3: max should play a whole season where he isnt allowed to play with anyone that has gotten CE before. would be good content
[5:42:54] Mattyuh: @Wh1teRic3 or mega run his fresh alt through 20s and funnel gear to him
[5:43:38] dsune_: ah yes
[5:43:44] dsune_: having to farm more m+ for raid

[5:45:35] MierkaBlue: <3 yeah, also get those raid items back - I'm tired waiting one specific trinket drop 13 weeks in a row
[5:45:39] Zircons: I’d be ok with that, bought gear should have permanent stink lines though
[5:46:28] luckystriketwo: but what would dung drop if u can buy everything

[6:37:59] flawlesslykun: BUT I HAVE HOPE
[6:42:32] acidrainforrestodruids: 4 dps should not be able to heal chromie on that last boss; it's crazy that the no healer strat is so effective
[6:43:40] acidrainforrestodruids: almost like healers are not necessary
[6:44:19] alkhean: you only need to heal it once between every soak phase. If all 5 are alive then chromie doesnt die during soak. Guardian druid can even fully heal chrome in like 10 sec :d
[6:44:28] alkhean: hybrids will heal it easily too
[6:45:22] malven33: that incident with Nerf was childish, i mean to ignore eachother like that in a game and james be like i never play with this guy again was very childish. i think james was looking for an excuse to not play again
[6:46:07] malven33: Ambition was very competetive, loved wathcing them play
[6:46:16] Stormy_o: @malven33 think some people dont wanna deal with bs OMEGALULq
[6:46:58] StreamElements: fresh youtube shorts going up 3x a week on https://www.youtube.com/@jdotb
[6:47:49] malven33: i get that, but at the same time its still childish, those things going to happen no matter wht
[6:48:17] jcoates1991: Would you be interested in officially casting the mdi if you were asked by blizzard?
[6:49:27] Twin029: chilling and "shittalking" with the boys worth more than the paycheck :D
[6:49:58] alkhean: You tweeted about world first race commenting. Would be cool to see you back in echo commentary. Liquid commentary team sucks anyway so everyone goes to max stream anyway :D
[6:50:20] malven33: what do you think of Mandatory s mistakes in both dungeons?
[6:50:54] alkhean: Sadge
[6:51:51] jcoates1991: Echo also have jeath as the resident healer expert
[6:52:05] alkhean: I really liked you back in these. Right now I pretty much tune in only when dratnos, krista and tettles are on. Rest of the usual echo cast doesn't even play the game and talk about FF only

[6:59:59] yesman297: also the thing about infernal is that u need to pop it atleast 5 sec before u wanna do dmg
[7:00:13] teqlamage: Max gave them the DDOS machine I swear down
[7:00:36] nash25pl: bald bandits ass tattao when ?
[7:00:37] sakecoke: Max pushed a button for sure
[7:00:56] Kennsenich: Ashine got MC'd by the priest that's outside the dungeon. THat's why Bandits are playing rogue Kappa

[7:12:17] flawlesslykun: ye Sadge
[7:12:21] reippailija: hahaha
[7:12:23] EwynTV: What's the point of disc over druid here if you play healer?
[7:12:32] flawlesslykun: i fucking hate atal dude...
[7:12:34] devilhawk83: Bald Bandits is falling apart to this dungeon
[7:12:36] reippailija: disband
[7:13:01] chlorophyllkid: 2nd PI?
[7:13:10] alkhean: Naowh analyzed all their runs and oddly enough almost every mage dmg diffed gingi but rest of the squad diffed opponents on same classes. I guess Gingi didnt prep these dungs enough on mage before prac.
[7:13:10] EwynTV: Right, but surely druid is capable of just overhealing the bursting as shown by many teams already so seems weird

[7:14:04] reippailija: KEKW
[7:14:14] cajovysacok: gingi is hunter main
[7:14:15] chaigy: Gingi on hunter is a different convo
[7:14:17] sybtje: imfiredup over gingi all day
[7:14:18] chaigy: but mage nah
[7:14:30] EriktheRed27: gingi's real strength is his shot-calling ability
[7:14:40] chaigy: @reippailija What?
[7:14:42] alkhean: yeah that too. He is turbo distracted
[7:14:46] malven33: appearently, the other mage in echos raid team is so muhc better than gingi but gingi seems to be the main guy, could it be because of who he is?
[7:15:04] reippailija: LMFAO
[7:15:09] devilhawk83: adeentHuh Gingi is one of my favourite Exho player
[7:15:17] chaigy: @reippailija ????

[7:16:31] devilhawk83: adeentHuh Not sure what you mean
[7:18:02] devilhawk83: One lesson I learn about Fortified Bolstering weeks is do not pull the bear with the trash as that bear nearly took up the full screen of my monitor
[7:18:12] devilhawk83: in DHT
[7:20:16] yesman297: luul
[7:23:42] totalecl1pse_: @malven33 iirc gingi is a partial owner in echo. theyre bring in hopeful so that gingi can play hunter which is what he prefers
[7:23:47] flawlesslykun: @jdotb know what randomly just crossed my mind ? previous MDI, a resto shaman called zaelia from echo, in halls of valor, dying 3 times in a row and getting up everytime classic but hey, dht dq's are really a no-no classic
[7:24:19] chlorophyllkid: why is this a MW dungeon?
[7:24:38] reippailija: big pulls, mw thrives on them
[7:24:40] flawlesslykun: @chlorophyllkid huge pulls, spin on trash, massive dmg and massive healing
