[1:05:31] HaxzorJimDuggan: the monitor arms are a bit overpriced in my opinion, I would probably test a 3rd party first
[1:05:38] Brezitrex: Buy it nice or buy it twice. Though I will say 800-1k for a desk is a little intense
[1:05:44] BattieBat: I paid over $600 for my plane sit/stand desk that I use for work. So that price really is not bad at all
[1:05:51] JoshuaTree6969: !desk

[2:48:32] vulkankragon: have you guys watched the recent interview with the riot mmorpg team? they said that game is deffo coming out and they are gunning for the top spot.
[2:48:39] Djfarmville: @nitroe sub rogue
[2:48:47] JustxVibez: The legend is at it again on World of Warcraft .. Lets go!
[2:49:29] smashwow: i think every MMO team has said that. they just need to execute well.
[2:49:36] Pallyofhell: @vulkankragon riot will kill the game dont worry. their history with balancing and how they handle the community isnt the best to say the least
[2:49:42] vulkankragon: they haven't decided on the monetization yet
[2:49:45] herculesrockefeller: riot can't even mage a decent client for their main game league
[2:49:50] herculesrockefeller: make*
[2:49:52] smashwow: the top spot will come if it's causal friendly, and has good content
[2:50:03] belfastcl: you are not in azeroth anymore
[2:50:19] smashwow: poor wildstar
[2:50:23] nitroe: I think Riot will make it a good game, all their games have been polished lately
[2:50:25] smashwow: the chosen one
[2:50:46] smashwow: brand recog is huge
[2:50:46] Heero_Effect: What if the WoW killer was the WoW we made along the way ?
[2:50:49] Pallyofhell: 13 years and the client is still shit though
[2:50:56] JoshuaTree6969: nothing will dethrone WOW ever.
[2:51:00] skylaars: Arcane being extremely successful will help as well
[2:51:22] Hebrewish012: i mean they did a good job with arcane
[2:51:24] Hebrewish012: it was a good show
[2:51:35] LadyNaara: arcane was fire
[2:51:36] Pallyofhell: riot also allows more game breaking bugs to hit live servers than wow does
[2:51:52] smashwow: @Pallyofhell i mean wow still has bugs in it from Vanilla and it's close to 20 years old *shrug*
[2:52:12] herculesrockefeller: RIOTS mmo being successful will only help wow. more computation is always good. I hope its really successful.
[2:52:44] Pallyofhell: i dont put faith in riot when it comes to balancing and bug fixes

[2:55:32] NotEnoughMana: they said no and left
[2:55:33] herculesrockefeller: @91Niki I think they went to some new startup

[2:56:29] Moobot: New D4 Twitch Prime Loot- Brackish Fetch Mount Armor Bundle https://shorturl.at/agACX
[2:57:01] Pallyofhell: ghost crawler is the main reason rets have been useless most of wow's lifespan
[2:57:11] ItsGlime: @Towelliee got the package the other day Pog thanks!
[2:57:21] vulkankragon: don't forget that infamous line by ghost crawler: bring the player, not the class
[2:57:24] herculesrockefeller: @91Niki I agree, D4 losing their lead dev really set them back. Having a new lead / new vision is a big deal.
[2:57:32] mavericks312: i will say that makes me doubt the riot mmo alittle now
[2:58:02] TaZd1ng0: Who was D4s lead dev that left?
[2:58:03] ItsGlime: the one with the wig lol
[2:58:19] 91Niki: @91Niki It's a red flag to me because it screams that something was going on that they didn't agree with.
[2:58:56] kaeleirra: One man's old used stuff is another man's treasure.
[2:59:02] 91Niki: and multiple people potentially disagreeing with how a game is developing is never a good thing
[2:59:04] Pallyofhell: @91Niki i mean its riot they do a lot of shit people dont agree with
[2:59:22] herculesrockefeller: @TaZd1ng0 the vegan tattoo guy, he was the lead dev. He had to leave or fired cuz he was in the cosby room pic
[2:59:38] 91Niki: @Pallyofhell one thing is customers disagreeing, another is lead devs
[2:59:51] ijuki: @91Niki Both good and bad, depends on how you look at it
[3:00:15] Eshel: @cordlesierra94  Reminds me of a Mitch Hedburg joke about flyers “it’s like someone is saying …here, you throw this away” lol
[3:00:22] Pallyofhell: oh they will def have a shop for cosmetics
[3:00:26] 91Niki: @ijuki I don't think it's ever a good thing
[3:00:47] M0nkTV: yo @Towelliee U gonna play Baldur's Gate 3?
[3:00:49] warrenny: League has story?
[3:00:59] Pallyofhell: yes league has a story
[3:01:02] 91Niki: @warrenny Have you watched the netflix show?! KEKW
[3:01:04] Faschius: go watch arcane
[3:01:12] 91Niki: Literally go watch Arcane LOL
[3:01:17] mavericks312: jinx alone had a whole show to herself basically
[3:01:21] warrenny: @91niki Nope
[3:01:21] ijuki: @91Niki Really? That is how innovation stems from, but I do not know, I do work with devolopment...
[3:01:26] Pallyofhell: like the league universe is actually almost as large as wow's universe
[3:01:26] Sollice: Morning
[3:01:32] vulkankragon: developing a new mmorpg and making it subscription based is basically instant product suicide in this day and age

[3:04:22] Pallyofhell: the art style doesn't interest me

[3:41:54] dimofodi: It doesn't come with a surger protector unless I'm mistaken so you just buy one that fits in there then it plugs in at that panel which essentially runs to an extention cable inside the leg to plug into the wall.
[3:42:06] HaxzorJimDuggan: keep in mind the power surge is not included its whatever you have to plug in to the one outlet

[3:45:12] AnimalCrackers_19: Which keyboard are you using now?
[3:45:18] Eshel: Zip ties are still step up from the old bread tie method from my childhood lmao

[3:47:42] BestoftheWurst: well that cord could go to a power back up... then to the wall?
[3:47:46] Eshel: The adjustable would also come in handy for different sized people - can adjust height to comfort ftw
[3:47:48] wEiRdO_dUdE: Having 6 grand of computer hanging is a little concerning, but it seems alright

[3:48:52] DiiscoViking: ups can be with or without surge
[3:48:54] BestoftheWurst: yeah not sure if it makes it more protected, but the battery back up would be essential
[3:48:56] smashwow: you can get a 6 outlet that is just in the wall
[3:48:56] HaxzorJimDuggan: think i read the desk itself has a built in surge protection
[3:49:14] ItsGlime: not bad
[3:49:17] MythrikX: IT guy here: Power distribution is not a new thing, and your wall outlet doesn't care. You don't need a classic protector. The power distribution is a power surge protector, as in, it actually cleans and evenly servers power for your devices
[3:49:26] smashwow: @HaxzorJimDuggan it does but the UPS is a normalizer + battery backup
[3:49:50] dimofodi: Yea I'd need a dual and a single. Which makes it worse! Lol

[3:50:41] dimofodi: When you look at the desk, there's an accessory bundle for the cable management clips, the sheaths, and the velcro for a little cheaper but not much.
[3:50:41] HaxzorJimDuggan: i plan to buy a cheap 3rd party monitor arms that would probably fit
[3:50:42] 3dRes: Definitely not an investment for the average joe

[4:32:32] turfjitsu: like dispells
[4:32:39] dimofodi: He said in a pug it's near impossible to coordinate the required kicks without overlapping and it's really punishing for pugs.

[4:33:17] trivotix: Overlapping is better said. If two people use it at the same time.
[4:33:19] dimofodi: If you read his tweet he's talking about when kicks overlap.
[4:33:54] valianya: Like two people interrupt and the person who does it later also deals with cooldown
[4:34:08] COGBLOCKERR: coinflip
[4:34:40] abracka_: https://youtu.be/wMzHNGDZr_8?t=509 pretty neat paladin judgement tier remake
[4:34:43] Molvonos: https://i.imgur.com/V449hal.jpg @Towelliee
[4:34:59] dimofodi: It's similar to saying you used HOJ on an unstunnable target so it shouldn't go on CD.
[4:35:08] JSkullage: see i'd rather have it the other way around, If I crit my cooldown resets, then stack crit

[4:38:03] Virgilx801: BC
[4:38:15] Unyates: purple was for all plate
[4:38:30] valianya: With how many mechanics need interruption, it makes some sense to only go on cooldown for who is registered as interrupting, if they want to make m+  more accessible to players.  Its players trying to do mechanics and getting punished for not being quick-draw mcgraw in the group.
[4:38:37] Unyates: had the helm and shoulders on my dk

[4:40:16] pereadin: It reminds me of a lighter
