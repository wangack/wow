[1:00:19] zgag: From what I saw most of the feedback agreed with the nerf, but the timing of the nerf was the main issue
[1:00:20] Rottencoarse: @Towelliee  they could have nerfed the destro lock after the RWF and before the MDI season 3
[1:00:28] Rottencoarse: like how they did to Demo Lock

[3:07:36] PinkCyberKitten: or just vodka LOL
[3:07:40] ShadowDMG6969: @poraxiss thanks for the gifted sub
[3:07:48] Morpheusx25: @Smoot247 blood it the tank spec
[3:08:22] BastialDK: You can still level as a Frost Tank but raids and Heroics u will want to be blood.
[3:08:29] Hellifyoudont66: Frost tanking is totally viable for normal content. Blood is the spec they pushed talents-wise, but all you really need is Defense gear, avoidance, and to be in Forst Presence.
[3:08:32] Smoot247: PepeHands
[3:08:38] ChiliMoMilli: @Morpheusx25 you could tank as frost in wrath
[3:08:53] Rottencoarse: aye
[3:09:03] Morpheusx25: @ChiliMoMilli early not with the patch they are going with
[3:09:03] Snabido: Need to complete certain questlines in the hubs
[3:09:08] SlamzandGramz: people unholy tanked in wrath
[3:09:09] ShadowDMG6969: Wrath was fun with the original Death Knight skills & Talents allowing you to use all 3 of the different Rune groups
[3:09:15] MusTiAkyZ: For The HORDEEEE
[3:09:37] Rottencoarse: @Towelliee u need to do some questlines to be able to start the wrathgate quests
[3:09:45] Hellifyoudont66: I definitely easily tanked any Normal raid as Frost, even in patch 3.3.5. DKs don't need to be Blood to tank.
[3:09:50] Ambelz: Rob, nothing but love, and sorry to do you like this, but remember "The Game" ? :)  to any other fellow oldies, you are welcome, you lost @towelliee
[3:10:07] MusTiAkyZ: Is there an Invincible's Reins mount?

[3:17:07] Fr0zenshock: how does it feel so far?
[3:18:02] Fr0zenshock: this was my first expansion, so im so tempted to play wow again.. hmm
[3:18:17] Rottencoarse: yeah with starter gear those grp quests are rough
[3:18:17] CenTr3xx: Same
[3:18:34] Hellifyoudont66: You're a Prot Pally, you should be able to solo most group quests at level as long as you have some decent Defense. You barely took damage in Nexus, you should be fine. It just might take a bit.
[3:19:10] mandilozano: group quest = hunter/lock quest
[3:20:18] Skkold: The music was great, listen to that
[3:20:19] Smoot247: warcraft 3 sold this expansion to me
[3:20:29] Reklusion: Skip cata classic and go to MoP npnp

[3:21:01] abracka_: mommystraza

[3:23:43] KizaruGR: I remember I loved this expansion because I played Warcraft 3 and found it somewhat a finale to its story. Then they had to fuck it up by making Arthas a glowing orb of nothing xD
[3:23:49] NotEnoughMana: did they just add that?
[3:24:50] Jewishraver: punch yourself in the dick lol
[3:24:59] Snabido: Ask him when DF prepatch is out
[3:25:00] Skkold: Future you didn't get any gear upgrades lol
[3:25:05] Smoot247: murozonds lore and backstory is mega sadge
[3:25:09] Utmost777: lol
[3:25:30] Utmost777: apparently you get 0 upgrades between now and then
[3:25:36] HaxzorJimDuggan: you do it again at 80 but i remember the mobs being lower level the first time
[3:25:47] Utmost777: no, he has the same gear you do

[3:27:08] Skkold: It was an illusion
[3:27:16] Jewishraver: ah the day when you push map button and still have no idea where the fuck you are lol

[3:28:25] forthereals: is the mob level a bug? Doesn't seem they should be 80. you could do these during leveling I thought
[3:28:27] Skkold: Makes sense
[3:28:29] HaxzorJimDuggan: pretty sure its bugged, it was never hard
[3:28:29] Baladore: Crus aura?
[3:28:51] CrunkyBrewster: yeah why are they 80? that seems odd
[3:28:54] Utmost777: gotta go fast!
[3:29:17] Baladore: Wasnt sure if you had Crus aura on while trying to tank last time.
