[3:38:45] Catstew1: Lazel isn't so great? Are you kidding me? When was the last time you saw a player with such an ability and movement with Blood DKs? Lazel puts the game on another level, and we will be blessed if we ever see a player with his skill and passion for the game again. Fragnance breaks records. Meowchan breaks records. Lazel breaks the rules. You can keep your statistics. I prefer the magic. And his haircut.
