[2:53:30] MeerTwT: is wierd that here meteor landing does no dmg
[2:53:45] shanu91: Status Killable Sure
[2:53:59] fLx_t: in theory, maybe
[2:54:01] Diatonic1: Prefoxquestion How mobs die to fire if they are fire
[2:54:03] fLx_t: :)
[2:54:33] MeerTwT: healers went in to late
[2:54:39] MeerTwT: they need tyo go faster to heal the dk
[2:54:41] Funkefetti: its a good idea to give the tank pain sub when he goes down
[2:54:54] Wynale: or just have hpala bubble
[2:55:05] Jonn_nner: KAK
[2:55:12] Jonn_nner: !roll another 100 xffing
[2:55:13] Nightbot: Jonn_nner rolls 85 (1-100)
[2:55:16] Jonn_nner: xff
[2:55:20] AliCrash: !roll wipe fest CokeShakey
[2:55:20] Nightbot: AliCrash rolls 26 (1-100)

[2:55:33] Jonn_nner: !roll katters xff
[2:55:33] Nightbot: Jonn_nner rolls 44 (1-100)
[2:55:34] MeerTwT: i mean he died in 3,8seconds
[2:55:40] MeerTwT: thats alot of time without heal
[2:55:47] Nightbot: Creoxx rolls 91 (1-100)
[2:55:54] shanu91: idk dying to cutter after like 2nd pull seems kinda pepega
[2:55:59] Jonn_nner: !roll Spyglass enjoyer xffing
[2:55:59] shanu91: i think even shanuzug can dodge cutters
[2:55:59] Nightbot: Jonn_nner rolls 31 (1-100)
[2:56:05] MeerTwT: it wasnt
[2:56:09] MeerTwT: shamajnd just had
[2:56:13] Jonn_nner: xdding
[2:56:15] Diatonic1: That transition from P1 > P2 is the scariest part. Tanks get murdered when they first go down.
[2:56:21] MeerTwT: es and riptide on him before he entered
[2:56:21] Diatonic1: And threat is sketch af
[2:56:27] WalterWhite__69: if I roll >69, the boss will die on next attempt
[2:56:29] MeerTwT: there was no heal inside with him
[2:56:30] WalterWhite__69: !roll
[2:56:30] Nightbot: WalterWhite__69 rolls 3 (1-100)
[2:56:31] coconutenjoyer: @Diatonic1 they die because they the spells consume all the oxygen and the mobs literally suffocate
[2:56:49] Funkefetti: cant weight to have parse andys on this fight, "we are missing 3% ret aura on top"
[2:56:52] viisceral: when tank goes in should use personal cooldown till veryone gets in and the situation stabalizes
[2:57:02] MeerTwT: yes
[2:57:07] MeerTwT: thats why u stay max mele range
[2:57:23] MeerTwT: in both realms in fire one to put meteor further from boss avoid putting it under boss
[2:57:34] MeerTwT: and in shadow realm so u dont get touched bye cutter
[2:57:45] batguy1337: melee can stand quite far back
[2:57:53] MeerTwT: yea
[2:58:00] coconutenjoyer: maybe try it on normal, no shame doing it on normal ok
[2:58:05] MeerTwT: the max mele range is quit far on this since his hitbox
[2:58:28] shanu91: is it too soon for the "hey i saw you struggling my guild finally killed last night if you want tips" pasta
[2:58:39] AliCrash: any warmane leaders xff
[2:58:49] MeerTwT: xd
[2:59:06] coconutenjoyer: @shanu91 no, post them ok
[2:59:23] Diatonic1: @shanu91 PepeLaff
[2:59:25] MeerTwT: is so different from warmane
[2:59:46] AliCrash: walk into the circle for more dmg fox PagMan
[2:59:46] MeerTwT: for example on warmane the emvers grow way faster near the living inferno and the aura of the living inferno hits way harder
[2:59:47] shanu91: ok tank is alive
[2:59:47] Dipsie: Boss is harder on warmane since p3 isnt bugged there
[2:59:49] shanu91: this is the pull
[3:00:28] Diatonic1: People still not realizing it's a totally new mob downstairs and threat is gonna be shit KEKL
[3:00:56] MeerTwT: the most fun part on this
[3:01:04] MeerTwT: is the tank need to sincronize with all group
[3:01:13] MeerTwT: on cutters so they both start moving same time'
[3:01:21] therox117: !roll
[3:01:21] Nightbot: therox117 rolls 54 (1-100)
[3:01:29] MeerTwT: yea
[3:01:36] hiStatue: people saying warmane is harder would be mindblowed if they tried retail
[3:01:39] MeerTwT: if tank and u guys move same time same direction
[3:01:46] shanu91: i mean what's most efficient for the tank could be less efficient for a dps right
[3:01:50] shanu91: they should just call a direction
[3:01:51] shanu91: imho
[3:02:03] MeerTwT: @Statue333 do u think so
[3:02:15] Dipsie: @Statue333 Meant that warmanes version of this fight is harder. The version that is on wotlk classic is bugged

[3:35:34] Diatonic1: I signed up for less runs this week because I can't handle people progressing on this monkaS
[3:35:50] therox117: What droppt
[3:36:03] banditoh1: i got exactly what i came for from this raid, invsible flyinbg horse Pog
[3:36:46] shanu91: and you got it cheap also
[3:36:56] shanu91: i want an invisible horse also but it's never below 50k in my raids
[3:36:57] Krigar_: xddez
[3:37:36] banditoh1: shanu just join good ol robokus runs they are around 20k all the time
[3:37:44] shanu91: i only join robokus runs
[3:37:50] shanu91: and i never saw it sub 50k
[3:37:59] shanu91: but i only do 1 raid/week so maybe i just got unlucky
[3:38:00] banditoh1: what
[3:38:06] banditoh1: yea prob unlucky
[3:38:19] banditoh1: check payout its almost always below 20k
[3:39:39] Creoxx: prefoxdn?
[3:39:45] shanu91: i may be exagerating
[3:39:49] shanu91: i checked and it was 35k last time
[3:39:51] global_shift: @Dipsie Neither did I. But progress is also 25 good players. There was not 25 good players in this raid.
[3:39:53] shanu91: still more than i'm willing to pay

[3:40:51] shanu91: i prefer this tbh music is constant
[3:40:52] snxgur2: if you have nvidia gpu u can use noise supression on the rtx software to block out backnoise but ofc will make ur voice sound alittle worse
[3:40:57] Creoxx: nah this is not mic issue, thats only when we dont hear music when you dont talk
[3:41:05] GERKAAN: what song is this
[3:41:06] Creoxx: this is just the mix itself
