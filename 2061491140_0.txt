[2:31:42] ponaris: Yo have a question about hot  streak do you want to use it after a fireball ? Also do you fireblast
[2:31:51] RagemcFly: is there video of jokered farming ambassador?
[2:31:53] Bittiesplzrespond: but BFD gear is better at 40 than leveling gear was at 25, right?
[2:31:55] Brelshar: I did Aquanis at the Blizzcon demo, he was busted AF lol
[2:32:03] LightBladeStream: KEKInsane
[2:32:10] Azibex: yap

[2:32:35] beastfroma: Will there be a way to get AB rep as we got WSG rep from ashenvale
[2:32:35] irvinwow: but gnomer didnt get any changes so far right?
[2:32:47] MoonZTi: I think gnomer has MORE mechanics but they are more forgiving.
[2:32:49] IF_YOU_READ_THIS_VI_VON: gnomer has a few more mechanics though, excited for what they do at 60
[2:32:51] boopbopbamski: gnomer is gonna FARM groups LUL
[2:32:55] LightBladeStream: @zacke10 yes, tuning wise. Gnomer is obviously harder mechanically
[2:33:03] Sadlychosen: I think gnomer was easier because we had runes and gear. We went with shit gear and not a lot of runes (weren't discovered) in bfd
[2:33:09] vinxarr: and then they complain its too easy KEKInsane
[2:33:10] ste2002nba: i member
[2:33:15] Brelshar: it shouldnt be nerfed tho to accomedate bad players
[2:33:20] Vetto_7: IS IT? HUHA SALAMI
[2:33:22] Nofl4me: i remember and we didnt kill last 2 bosses xdd
[2:33:28] antmd15: Most people are raiding without wb because theyre scared to lose it
[2:33:29] Qeevdo: Was kinda sad to see how easy gnomer was with a full raid of non-geared 40a
[2:33:31] LightBladeStream: @Brelshar yes it should, classic players are bad
[2:33:32] YzieGG: gnomer is not hard at all
[2:33:32] chasen218: why u dont play retail ? u cant survive there? @JokerdTV
[2:33:32] real_spin: and no runes KEKL
[2:33:35] papamafs: but you are still raiding gnomer with full BFD raid items and epics
[2:33:40] Fredthegred: no gear at all NOWAY
[2:33:41] auynho: i had WSG helmet
[2:33:51] ste2002nba: i was full bis day 1

[2:34:36] LightBladeStream: @chasen218 Tomfoolery "Can't survive retail", he lirly is in the top 0.01% of raiders at some point
[2:34:43] M1shox_: you will never forget that warrior without chest rune :D
[2:34:51] chasen218: @LightBladeStream ok chill i was joking lol
[2:35:01] xMASI_: Kelris was not insane. People just didnt know how to handle Shadow Chains

[2:37:51] Zeex101: 2 minutes of ads nice
[2:37:51] dagmykle: so many bosses in gnomer that'll be a pug-killer imo
[2:37:54] xdlulxd: gnomer gear is barely upgrade from BFD
[2:37:56] Nenea93: are you still using lvl 25 gear?
[2:38:03] loudriantv: the gear is not huge difference compared to full bfd gear .. so gnome will be harder
[2:38:07] Tafson: @dagmykle Nah just last boss
[2:38:15] Fennyyy: nah gnomer gear is way better for heals at least lol
